    Dunhuang Wheat Yields 1,000 Jin Per Mu
    The CCP Dunhuang County Committee
    The 66,181 mu of spring wheat sown in Dunhuang County, Gansu Province in 1958 achieved an average yield of 1,037.1 jin per mu, a remarkable high yield. This is a miraculous event in Dunhuang.
    This year's spring wheat harvest was not due to superior natural conditions. On the contrary, Dunhuang is a region with a dry climate, very little rainfall, frequent sandstorms, highly saline-alkaline soil, and a lack of organic matter. Therefore, the main reasons for achieving the bumper harvest are the correct leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the county, strong support and cooperation from all sides, the victory of ideological education, and the result of actively fighting against nature.
    The fact that wheat could yield 1,000 jin per mu in 1958 was also because of the implementation of assigning targets to teams, measures to plots, and responsibility to individuals; ten parts target, twelve parts measures, and twenty-four parts effort. Regarding yield-increasing measures, after mass debates, each commune had a general plan, and executed the plan in phases and seasons, which facilitated regular and quantitative inspections, playing a decisive role in realizing the goal of a "1,000-jin county."
    Before the spring sowing, most of the livestock in the county suffered from foot-and-mouth disease. Because livestock movement was restricted for more than a month, the county committee proposed replacing animal power with human power to transport fertilizer. At that time, the masses were not ideologically aligned, so the county party secretary and committee members personally pulled carts, transporting fertilizer from the city to the agricultural cooperatives, which greatly motivated the people of the county, and the entire county launched a high tide of transporting and accumulating fertilizer. At the same time, Party committees at all levels, with the personal participation of the secretaries, vigorously engaged in experimental plots, increasing agricultural production knowledge and becoming experts in leading agricultural production.
    In the process of the Great Leap Forward, advanced ideas and backward ideas are often in struggle. Only with the victory of ideological work can there be a bumper harvest in production. Therefore, the county committee leadership has always grasped this law in every production task—clarifying the truth and unifying understanding. When formulating the production plan, after the county committee proposed striving to achieve the 1,000-jin target, some people said it was bragging. Therefore, a large-scale debate was launched throughout the county on how to insert the banner of high yield of grain and cotton on the land of Dunhuang. As a result, the confidence of the masses was enhanced, and measures to increase production were found. Later, methods such as counting in the fields, looking in the fields, and measuring in the fields were adopted to severely criticize right-leaning conservative thinking. This played an important role in promoting field management in the later stage and further improving the production enthusiasm of the people of the county.
    Using the spirit of continuous revolution and the thought of continuous leap forward to guide agricultural production, one upsurge followed another, and the masses' production enthusiasm remained high. In addition to planting experimental plots, county leaders also frequently organized people to go deep into the countryside to investigate and study, promptly summarize advanced experiences, promptly propose new battle slogans, and continuously guide the people to move forward.
    During the wheat production period, the county held five large-scale on-site meetings, and various townships also held 36 on-site meetings, which played a decisive role in comprehensively guiding production. Through inspection and evaluation, not only were experiences exchanged, but also red flag competitions were launched between each other, which further encouraged the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. In pest control and elimination of Class III fields, after on-site evaluation, the county basically eliminated pests and diseases in three days and three nights, and all Class III fields were fertilized again.
    Support from all sides and vigorous cooperation also had a direct relationship with obtaining a bumper wheat harvest. When the county committee proposed the slogan of a double leap forward in grain and cotton, a large-scale debate was held in all county departments. Through the debate, cadres of county departments and urban residents were mobilized to vigorously support agricultural production. Urban residents sent fertilizer to the countryside; cadres cleaned their own office toilets and gave the fertilizer to the countryside free of charge; commercial, supply and marketing, banking, and credit departments all vigorously supported agricultural production.
    In order to strengthen scientific guidance for agricultural production, 33 "10,000-jin Universities" were established throughout the county, and agricultural technology dissemination stations were established in rural areas, with designated technical cadres conducting dissemination on a regular basis. At the same time, nine short-term training courses were held, training more than 5,000 farmer technicians throughout the county. The county committee specially convened three wheat technology research meetings to solve the technical problems of spring wheat production. (Attached image)

    敦煌小麦亩亩产千斤
    中共敦煌县委会
    甘肃敦煌县1958年播种的六万六千一百八十一亩春小麦，获得了平均亩产一千零三十七点一斤的高额丰产。这是敦煌的奇闻奇事。
    今年春小麦丰收，并不是因为自然条件优越，相反的敦煌是一个气候干燥、雨量极少、风沙较多、土质盐碱性大、有机质缺乏的地区。因此，取得丰收的主要原因是党的正确领导，政治挂了帅，全县人民冲天的干劲，各方面大力的支援和协作，思想教育工作的胜利，积极的向自然斗争的结果。
    1958年小麦能够亩产千斤，也因为贯彻了指标到队，措施到地，责任到人；十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲的结果。对增产措施，经过群众大辩论，作到了社社有总的计划，分期分季的执行计划，这就便于定时定量的进行检查，对实现千斤县起了决定性的作用。
    春播前，全县多数牲畜发生了口蹄疫，由于封锁牲畜行动一个多月，县委就提出了人力代替畜力运肥。当时群众思想不通，县委书记和委员就亲自拉车，把城里的肥料送到农业社，对全县人民起了极大的带动作用，全县人民掀起了运肥积肥高潮。同时各级党委在书记亲自参加下，大搞试验田，增加了农业生产知识，变成了领导农业生产的内行。
    在大跃进的过程中，先进思想和落后思想经常是有斗争的，只有思想工作的胜利，才有生产的丰收。所以县委领导每一项生产工作始终抓住了这一规律——辩清道理，统一认识。制订生产计划时，县委提出力争实现千斤指标以后，有些人说是吹牛。因此在全县开展了如何把粮棉大面积的丰产旗帜插到敦煌土地上的大辩论，结果提高了群众的信心，找到了增产的措施。后来又采取了到田间数，田间看，田间测量的方法，狠狠的对右倾保守思想进行了一次批判。这对促进后期的田间管理，进一步提高全县人民的生产积极性有重要作用。
    运用不断革命的精神，不断跃进的思想，指导农业生产一个高潮接着一个高潮，群众的生产情绪始终饱满。县的领导人员除种试验田以外，还经常组织人深入到农村调查研究，及时总结先进经验，及时提出新的战斗口号，不断引导人民群众前进。
    在小麦生产期，全县召开过五次大型的现场会议，各乡也先后召开过三十六次现场会议，这对全面指导生产起了决定性的作用。通过检查评比，不但交流了经验，而且互相之间开展了红旗竞赛，因而更鼓舞了干部和群众的生产积极性。在治虫、消灭三类田上，经过现场评比后，三天三夜全县就基本上消灭了病虫害，全部的三类田又追了一次肥。
    各方面的支援和大力的协作，对取得小麦丰收也有直接关系。县委提出粮棉双跃进口号时，全县机关都进行了大辩论，通过辩论，动员全县机关干部、城镇市民大力的支援农业生产。城市居民向农村送肥料；机关的厕所由干部自己垫，并将肥料无代价的送给农村；商业、供销、银行、信用部门都大力的支援了农业生产。
    为了对农业生产加强科学指导，全县建立了万斤大学三十三处，并在农村建立了农业技术传授站，指定技术干部按时进行传授。同时举办了九次短期训练班，全县共训练了农民技术员达五千余人，县委专门召开过小麦技术研究会议三次，解决了春小麦生产技术问题。（附图片）
