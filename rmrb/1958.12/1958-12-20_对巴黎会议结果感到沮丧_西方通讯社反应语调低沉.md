Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: After the closing of the North Atlantic Council meeting in Paris, Western news agencies did not exaggerate the "success" of the meeting, and only broadcast a few comments in a low-key tone.

These comments tried hard to reassure Western readers that the "achievement of a consensus" among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries on the Berlin issue was the "greatest achievement" of the meeting, attempting to illustrate that the meeting was not without gains, despite the quarrels and disagreements. But even on this point, Reuters' commentary pointed out in an uncertain tone that "the allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization still need to decide" what "specific actions the West will take" when the Soviet Union implements its decision to end the occupation of Berlin in six months.

Apart from this single so-called agreed issue, as soon as the Western news agencies' comments touched upon a series of sharp contradictions among the North Atlantic Group countries, they couldn't help but reveal a strong sense of frustration. Agence France-Presse admitted that "serious rifts exist in the meeting militarily, politically, and economically." This news agency tried to reassure people by saying that these rifts "have at least been temporarily patched up for the time being." But it also wrote: "No real decisions have been made on mediating the differences between the partners of the North Atlantic Organization," and "Efforts have been made to resolve the quarrels between some members of this alliance (these issues were raised again during the three-day ministerial council meeting and outside the meeting), but the actual solutions are left to be done later." In this regard, Agence France-Presse cited the dispute between Britain and Iceland over fishing range issues and the dispute between Britain, Greece, and Turkey over the Cyprus issue as examples.

Agence France-Presse also wrote that after this meeting, "there is no indication that any country other than Britain and Italy will agree to set up launching bases for medium-range ballistic missiles in the near future, while (North Atlantic Group) military leaders believe that setting up such bases is absolutely necessary."

A Reuters commentary believes that the following issues "have not been resolved" at this meeting: 1. The issue of "the division of European (Western European) trade" (referring to the opposition between "Common Market" countries and non-"Common Market" countries on trade issues); 2. The issue of France's request for the United States and Britain to conduct "closer consultations on a global scale" with it; 3. The issue of France's "go-slow tactics" in military cooperation within the North Atlantic Group.

Reuters believes that all these issues will be brought up for further discussion at the next meeting of the North Atlantic Council to be held in Washington in April next year.

United Press International wrote, "The Council meeting failed to overcome the reluctance of the European members of the North Atlantic Group to accept American nuclear weapons and missile bases, although the communique did not mention this."

It went on to say, "France remains one of the main opponents of establishing missile bases, and despite a long talk between Dulles and Prime Minister de Gaulle, the three-day meeting still failed to break France's opposition."

### 对巴黎会议结果感到沮丧  西方通讯社反应语调低沉

    对巴黎会议结果感到沮丧
    西方通讯社反应语调低沉
    新华社19日讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋集团理事会会议闭幕以后，西方通讯社没有大肆吹嘘会议的“成功”，只播发了寥寥几篇语调低沉的评论。
    这些评论竭力想安慰西方的读者，北大西洋集团国家就柏林问题“取得一致意见”是会议的“最大成就”，企图以此来说明会议除了争吵和分歧之外至少还不是没有收获的。但是即使在这一点上，路透社的评论仍然以不肯定的口吻指出，“北大西洋公约组织的盟国仍然尚需决定”，在半年后苏联实施结束柏林的被占领状态的决定对“西方将采取什么具体行动”。
    除了这个唯一的所谓取得一致的问题以外，一接触到北大西洋集团国家彼此间一大串尖锐的矛盾，西方通讯社的评论就情不自禁地流露出浓重的沮丧情绪。法新社承认，“会议在军事上、政治上和经济上存在着严重的裂痕”。这家通讯社企图安慰人心说，这些裂痕“至少目前是暂时地得到了胶合”。但是它又写道：“在调解北大西洋组织伙伴之间的分歧上没有作出真正的决定”，“在这个联盟的某些成员国之间的争吵问题（这些问题是在三天的部长理事会会议上以及会外都再次被提出）上，已经作了努力来解决，但是实际的解决留待以后去做”。在这方面，法新社举出英国和冰岛在捕鱼范围问题上的争执和英国、希腊、土耳其在塞浦路斯问题上的争执作为例子。
    法新社还写道，在这次会议之后，“没有迹象表明，除了英国和意大利以外，别的国家会同意在最近的将来设置中程弹道导弹的放射基地，而（北大西洋集团）军事首脑们认为设置这种基地是绝对必要的。”
    路透社的一条评论认为，在下列问题上，这次会议“没有得到解决”，即：一、“欧洲（西欧）贸易的分裂”（指“共同市场”国家同非“共同市场”国家的在贸易问题上的对立）问题；二、法国要求美国和英国同它进行“世界范围的更密切的协商”的问题；三、法国在北大西洋集团的军事合作方面“进行怠工”的问题。
    路透社认为，在定在明年4月在华盛顿举行的北大西洋集团理事会下一次会议上，所有这些问题都还要提出来再讨论。
    合众国际社写道，“理事会会议没有能克服北大西洋集团欧洲成员国对于接受美国核武器和导弹基地的不乐意，尽管（会议）公报并没有提到这一点”。
    它接着说，“法国仍然是反对建立导弹基地的主要坚持者之一，尽管杜勒斯和戴高乐总理作了一次长谈，三天的会议仍然没有能打破法国的对立。”
