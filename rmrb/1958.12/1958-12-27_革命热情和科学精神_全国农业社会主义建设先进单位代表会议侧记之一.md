    Revolutionary Enthusiasm and Scientific Spirit
    ——A Glimpse of the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, Part 1
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

    "Chairman Mao told us that in order to accomplish our tasks, we must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit in all our work. Whether in rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, in arranging production and allocating labor, in promoting new agricultural techniques and implementing tool reforms, we must conduct in-depth investigations and research, formulate realistic plans, and stipulate practical and feasible measures to make our work more and more meticulous. ..." Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, gave such earnest instructions to the six thousand representatives of the five hundred million heroic peasants from the vast rural areas of the motherland. This is the Party Central Committee's meticulous concern for the five hundred million peasants. All the representatives listened with rapt attention. In the assembly hall that could accommodate six or seven thousand people, there was hardly any noise. Only Comrade Shaoqi's kind and resounding voice echoed in the hall. At this moment, many representatives were overwhelmed by the immense happiness of meeting the leaders, but their sense of responsibility for their work naturally made them churn in their minds, quickly using the spirit of the Central Committee to examine all their work. Li Ancai, the deputy director of the Wolong People's Commune in Suixi County, Anhui Province, was one such person. Look at him, leaning his tall body forward in order to see Comrade Shaoqi's face more clearly and to remember every word firmly in his heart. On the one hand, he was still secretly amazed at how clearly our beloved leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Liu understood the affairs of the peasants! Every word they said touched the hearts of the peasants. The members of the Wolong People's Commune had combined soaring drive with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts to create the miracle of the Great Leap Forward. On a saline-alkali depression that had been barren nine years out of ten and plagued by floods and droughts, a land of fish and rice with a network of rivers and canals had emerged. They were the first to respond to the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's battle call to "transform northern Anhui into Jiangnan" and engaged in large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. They dug many ditches, preparing to change to rice cultivation. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally went to the water conservancy front line. When he arrived at their place and saw the crisscrossing ditches they had dug, full of spirit, he suggested that they take a step forward, combining irrigation and transportation to create a water network, which would more thoroughly solve the problem of waterlogging and drought. As a result, the commune members saw the direction of their struggle and worked even harder. By the end of June this year, they had dug a section of a canal sixty meters wide, three large ditches thirty meters wide, five medium ditches twenty meters wide, and six small ditches ten feet wide. Ditches connected to ditches, canals linked to canals, the water was clear and bottomless, fish swam and played, a scene of Jiangnan scenery. In places where boats had never been seen before, the pleasant whistle of small motorboats also sounded. The six thousand mu of rice they changed to planting yielded a bumper harvest of more than 2,100 jin per mu, despite the fact that it did not rain for half a year and there were 400 millimeters of rain in five days. Their project has already exceeded the requirements of the water network proposed by the Provincial Party Committee. No wonder Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, exclaimed when he arrived there: "This is not just a water network, it's simply a river network." In this way, their work always went ahead of the targets, breaking through the targets time and time again. There are countless communes like the Wolong People's Commune that have both a pioneering spirit of revolution and a down-to-earth style of work across the country. This is why this year's grain and cotton have doubled, and an unprecedented great victory has been won on my country's agricultural front.

    Chairman Mao and the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee always teach us that we must conduct in-depth investigations and research into all our work. Comrade Liu Mengjin, the county party secretary and representative of Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, has a particularly deep understanding of this point. Dunhuang, located on the Northwest Plateau near the Gobi Desert, can increase production every year (this year it is even a county with 1,000 jin of cotton and grain). Isn't it because the county party committee personally investigated and researched and initially grasped the natural laws of Dunhuang that it has become a dazzling red flag on the Northwest Plateau? The county party committee analyzed the favorable conditions of Dunhuang: all are irrigated land, the soil is good, and the sunshine hours are long (more than 3,200 hours a year), and the farmers have rich farming experience. The unfavorable conditions of Dunhuang are low rainfall (only 44.7 mm per year), high evaporation, and very serious insect pests. For those favorable conditions, the county party committee studied how to make full use of them. For these unfavorable conditions, the county party committee mobilized the farmers of the entire county to overcome them. For example, in order to conquer drought, half of the labor force in the county was mobilized last winter to build water conservancy projects, find underground water sources, and strengthen canal management. In order to reduce evaporation, farmers were mobilized to plant early in the autumn to seize moisture, and to store water in the winter to preserve moisture. The county party committee's scientific analysis combined with the masses' down-to-earth hard work has enabled Dunhuang's production to increase year by year, the people's lives to improve year after year, and the people to work more enthusiastically and creatively year by year!

    It is a rare creation in the history of world water conservancy projects to divert water up the mountain at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters, to change the course of a river of more than 500 kilometers to go up the mountain, and to build a mountain canal flowing through more than 20 counties and totaling 4,000 kilometers. Only the Chinese people who have liberated their minds and have a bold and daring style can accomplish this heroic undertaking. Comrade Liang Zhaopeng, the representative of the Gansu Yintao Project Bureau, attended this conference with such a sense of pride. Naturally, this is an unprecedentedly arduous project. Liang Zhaopeng and his colleagues in the project bureau all deeply know: Strategically, we must boldly despise nature, and tactically, we must pay great attention to difficulties. We must have both revolutionary drive and a scientific attitude. They solved many technical problems with a revolutionary drive to break the rules and a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. In the past, it took at least five years from survey and design to construction. This time, they adopted the method of surveying, designing, and constructing at the same time, and started construction in three months to half a year. The loess soil quality of a section of the canal was not good, and the water subsided after passing through the canal, and the project could not proceed. At that time, Liang Zhaopeng conducted investigations and interviews with the local people everywhere, consulted relevant scientific literature for loess experiments, and consulted Soviet and Chinese experts, and finally found a solution. In order to solve a problem, on the one hand, we must dare to think and dare to do, break the rules; on the other hand, we must honestly consult the masses, consult experts, find theoretical references, do research experiments, and come up with a variety of solutions to conduct research on the spot. This year's water conservancy construction is precisely because we rely on thousands of bold dreamers and down-to-earth hard workers like Liang Zhaopeng and his comrades that we have been able to achieve such amazing achievements in such a short period of time.

    Yes, on these six thousand representatives from all over the motherland, there are poems written by thousands of masses with revolutionary drive and selfless labor. And this year's entire epic of agricultural production was written by 500 million peasants with a great style of daring to think and dare to do and a down-to-earth spirit of hard work. Their revolutionary enthusiasm is like a surging ocean, and their scientific spirit of practical work is like a towering mountain. In the face of such a sea and such a mountain, the giant of nature has to bow his head and honestly pay the wealth we demand from it—750 billion jin of grain and 67 million dan of cotton!

    革命热情和科学精神
    ——全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议侧记之一
    本报记者  金凤
    “毛主席告诉我们，为了实现我们的任务，必须在任何工作中把革命热情和科学精神结合起来。不论在整顿和巩固人民公社的工作上，在生产的安排和劳动力的调配上，在推广新的农业技术和实行工具改革的工作上，我们都必须进行深入的调查研究，制订合乎实际的计划，规定切实可行的措施，使工作愈做愈细致。……”中共中央副主席刘少奇同志代表中共中央，对着来自祖国辽阔农村的五亿英雄农民的六千代表，这样谆谆教导着。这是党中央对于五亿农民无微不至的关怀。全体代表这样全神贯注地倾听着。在容纳六七千人的大会场里，几乎听不到一点杂音，只有少奇同志亲切的朗朗的声音，在大厅里回响着。这个时刻，有多少代表一面被和领袖见面的巨大幸福感压倒了，但是工作上的责任感又使他们自然地在脑海中翻腾着，飞快地用中央的精神来检查着自己的全部工作。安徽省濉溪县卧龙人民公社的副主任李安才就是这样的一个人。你看他，一面把高大的身躯倾向前去，为的是能更清楚一点看清楚少奇同志的面容，更深切地把每句话牢牢记在心里。一方面还是暗暗惊讶，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席和刘副主席，他们多么清楚农民的事啊！他们说的话，一句句都说到农民的心上。卧龙人民公社的社员正是把冲天的干劲和科学的实事求是精神结合了起来，才作出大跃进的奇迹。在一块十年九荒、水旱灾情不断的盐碱洼地上，出现了河网化的鱼米之乡。他们首先响应安徽省委“变淮北为江南”的战斗号召，去冬今春大干水利。他们挖了许多沟渠，准备改种水稻。省委第一书记曾希圣同志亲赴水利前线，到了他们那里，看到他们挖的沟渠纵横，大有气魄，就建议他们提高一步，把灌溉、运输结合起来，搞个水网化，比较彻底地解决水旱灾的问题。这一来，社员们看到了奋斗方向，干劲更大。到今年6月底，他们就挖了六十公尺宽的运河一段，三十公尺宽的大沟三条，二十公尺宽的中沟五条，还有十尺宽的小沟六条。沟沟相通，渠渠相连，水清见底，游鱼相戏，一片江南风光。在从来没有见过船的地方，也响起了小火轮愉快的汽笛声。他们改种的六千亩水稻，在半年不下透雨、五天下雨四百公厘的情况下，获得亩产二千一百多斤的丰收。他们的工程，已经超过了省委提出的水网化的要求。难怪中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志到了他们那里，赞叹说：“这不仅仅是水网化，简直是河网化了。”就这样，他们的工作总是走到指标的前面，把指标一次次的突破。像卧龙人民公社这种既有革命首倡精神，又有踏踏实实作风的公社，在全国又何啻成千上万。这才使得今年粮食、棉花成倍地增长，在我国农业战线上打了一次空前的大胜仗。
    毛主席和党中央负责同志总是教导我们，对于各项工作都必须进行深入的调查研究。这一点，甘肃省敦煌县的代表、县委书记刘孟晋同志体会得特别深切。位于西北高原接近大戈壁沙漠的敦煌能够年年增产，（今年更是棉粮千斤县），成为西北高原的一面夺目的红旗，难道不是因为县委亲自调查研究，初步掌握了敦煌的自然规律的结果吗？县委分析敦煌的有利条件是：全部是水浇地，土质好，日照时间长（一年有三千二百多小时），农民的耕作经验丰富。而敦煌的不利条件是雨量少（一年只降雨四十四点七公厘），蒸发量大，虫害十分严重。对于那些有利条件，县委研究要充分利用它。对于这些不利条件，县委动员全县农民来战胜它。譬如为了要征服干旱，全县去冬动员一半劳力兴修水利，寻找地下水源，加强渠道管理。为了减少蒸发，动员农民秋季早种抢墒，冬季蓄水保墒。县委这些科学的分析同群众踏踏实实的干劲结合起来，就使得敦煌生产年年增长，群众生活一年好似一年，群众一年比一年干得有兴致有创造！
    在拔海二千多公尺的山上引水上山，使一条五百多公里的河流改道上山，建立一道流经二十多个县、总长四千公里的山上运河，这在世界水利工程史上是少见的创举。只有解放了思想、具有敢想敢干风格的中国人民才能完成这种英雄的事业。甘肃引洮工程局的代表梁兆鹏同志就带着这种自豪的心情来出席这次大会。自然，这是一项空前艰巨的工程。梁兆鹏和工程局的同志都深深知道：战略上要大胆藐视自然，战术上要十分重视困难。既要有革命的干劲，还要有科学的态度。他们很多技术问题都是用打破常规的革命干劲同实事求是的科学态度来解决的。过去从勘察设计到施工，至少需用五年。这次他们采取边勘察边设计边施工，三个月到半年就动手开工。有一段渠道的黄土土质不好，水经过渠道都下陷，工程不能进行。当时梁兆鹏到处向当地群众调查访问，翻查有关的科学文献进行黄土试验，请教苏联和中国的专家，最后找到了解决的办法。为了解决一个问题，一方面是敢想敢干，打破常规；一方面是老老实实请教群众，请教专家，找理论参考，做研究试验，搞出多种方案，到现场进行研究。我们今年的水利建设，正由于依靠着像梁兆鹏和他的战友们一样千千万万大胆的梦想家和脚踏实地的干将，因而能够在这么短的时间内，取得这样惊人的成就。
    是的，在这来自祖国各地的六千名代表身上，都有着成千上万群众用革命干劲和忘我劳动写成的诗篇。而今年农业生产的整部史诗是由五亿农民用敢想敢干的伟大风格和踏踏实实的苦干精神写成的。他们的革命热情正仿佛奔腾澎湃的海洋，而他们科学的实干精神又仿佛巍然凝重的高山。在这样的大海和高山面前，自然巨人不得不低下头来，老实地付出了我们向它索取的财富——七千五百亿斤粮食和六千七百万担棉花！
