From our Hefei Dispatch: The fruit trees planted eight years ago by the Dawn Commune in Woyang County, Anhui Province, have yielded over 1.15 million jin of fruit this year. Averaged per capita, each person has nearly 300 jin of fruit.

“Fruit trees grow into forests and stand in rows, fruit for all seasons stored at home, people say paradise is infinitely good, but it can’t compare to my hometown.” This is a song of praise from the members of the Dawn Commune, and also the reality of life for the members of the Dawn Commune. The more than four thousand people of the Dawn Commune live in this rich and beautiful place, the original swamp land, now transformed into a beautiful orchard. More than twenty villages are tightly surrounded by dense fruit trees. In the transition between spring and summer, hundreds of flowers bloom here, truly every village is a garden. The people here can eat all kinds of fragrant and sweet fruits throughout the year. They not only use fruit to quench their thirst when resting from work in the summer, but also in winter, every household stores one or two kinds of dried fruits – dried dates or persimmon cakes. This year is a year of great fruit harvest here, of the more than 420,000 fruit trees, 14,115 have already borne abundant fruit.

The commune members are all elated to eat the fruits they have cultivated with their own hands. However, the development of fruit trees here has had a tortuous process. In 1951, the Dawn Commune Party Branch, in order to change the impoverished state of affairs where harvests were poor nine years out of ten, put forward the call to "turn depressions into fertile fields, turn villages into orchards," leading the masses to vigorously develop grain production on the one hand, and leading the masses to plant fruit trees on the other. At that time, a few short-sighted people with conservative ideas opposed this approach. Commune member Ji Mingjin said, "Planting fruit trees wastes money, wastes land, and wastes labor. I don't think it will amount to anything." Party Branch Secretary Zhou Wancang and Commune Head Ji Mingxuan took the lead by example, personally leading the planting of fruit trees, while also educating the masses, explaining that fruit trees are resistant to disasters and guarantee harvests, one good harvest can be worth several years of crops, and in the first few years when the trees are small, grain can be grown, and after a few years, not only can you eat fruit, but also beautify the village. The masses were persuaded, but there was a lack of seeds and understanding of cultivation techniques. Therefore, the Party Branch relied on the masses to find solutions. They adopted methods such as collecting seeds locally and collecting seeds from other places to obtain a lot of seeds. In order to learn cultivation techniques, they organized experienced old farmers to impart techniques to everyone, and sent people to famous fruit-producing areas to study and select young people to participate in fruit tree cultivation training classes. In this way, many people not only learned general cultivation, but also learned to use grafting methods to improve the varieties of fruit trees.

In leading fruit production, the Party Branch here also established a fruit tree professional team with the Deputy Secretary as the core, responsible for various tasks such as seedling cultivation, cultivation, and pruning. In 1953, the Party Branch further proposed the battle slogan of "hard work for three years, beautify the hometown", combined with greening, and planted a large number of fruit trees using ditches, house sides, and open spaces. Up to now, more than 420,000 peach trees, pear trees, apricot trees, grapes, cherries, persimmons, jujube trees, pomegranates, apples, etc. have been planted, with an average of 105 fruit trees per person. In the past few years, they have done a lot of research and improvement in fruit tree cultivation, changing the past habit of not fertilizing fruit trees here. Due to their meticulous management, many fruit trees have matured earlier.

The great fruit harvest has made people realize the benefits of this production. People who originally thought that "planting fruit trees wastes money" also said: "Planting fruit trees on empty land is worth five years."

Now the people here are more interested in developing fruit tree production. They have decided to plant another 21,000 apple, peach, grape and other fruit trees next year, and also plan to cultivate 30 mu of nurseries for crabapple, pear, and other trees. (Shi Zhengzhang, Chen Liyan)

    桃杏柿梨长满沟边屋旁
    曙光一社每人平均有水果三百斤
    本报合肥电  安徽省涡阳县曙光一社在八年前种植的果树，今年结了一百一十五万多斤果实。按人口平均，每人可有水果近三百斤。
    “果木成林树成行，四季水果家中藏，人说天堂无限好，那能比上我家乡。”这是曙光一社社员的赞歌，也是曙光一社社员的生活现实。曙光一社的四千多个人就生活在这块富饶美丽的地方，原来的湖洼之地，现在已变成美丽的果园。二十几个村庄紧紧地被茂密的果树包围着。在春夏之交，这里百花盛开，真是村村是花园。这里的人民一年四季都可吃到各种又香、又甜的水果。他们不仅暑天干活休息时用水果来解喝，就是在冬天，家家户户也都藏着一两种干果——干枣或柿饼。今年是这里水果大丰收的一年，四十二万多棵水果树，已有一万四千一百一十五棵结了丰硕的果实。
    社员们吃到自己亲手栽培的果实，个个兴高采烈。但是这里发展果木是有一段曲折的过程的。1951年曙光一社党支部为了改变这里十年九不收的贫困面貌，提出了“变洼地为良田，变村庄为果园”的号召，一方面领导群众大力发展粮食生产，一方面领导群众种植果树。当时个别眼光短浅，有保守思想的人反对这种作法。社员纪明金说：“栽果树既浪费钱，浪费地，又浪费劳力，我看搞不出什么名堂。”党支书周万仓、社长纪明选就以身作则，亲自带头种果树，同时向群众进行教育，说明果树抗灾保收，一年丰收能顶几年庄稼，而且头几年树小能种粮，几年后不仅能吃到水果，还能美化村庄。群众被说服了，但是缺乏种子，不懂栽培技术。于是党支部又依靠群众，找到了解决问题的办法。他们采取了就地采集树种和向外地采种等办法取得不少树种。为了学会栽培技术，他们一方面组织有经验的老农向大家传授技术，一方面派人到著名水果产地学习和选派青年参加果树栽培训练班。这样，很多人不仅学会了一般栽培，而且还学会了用嫁接方法改良果木的品种。
    在领导水果生产上，这里的党支部还以副书记为核心成立了果木专业队，负责育苗、培植、整枝等各种工作。1953年，党支部又进一步提出“苦战三年，把家乡美化起来”的战斗口号，结合绿化，利用沟边、宅旁及空地大量种植果树。到目前为止，已种桃树、梨树、杏树、葡萄、樱桃、柿子、枣树、石榴、苹果等四十二万多棵，每人平均有一百零五棵果树。几年来，他们在果树培植上，作了不少研究和改进，改变了这里过去对果树不施肥的习惯。由于他们的精细管理，很多果树都提早了成熟期。
    果品大丰收使人们认识到这项生产的好处，原来认为“栽果树浪费钱”的人也说出了：“空地种果树，一年顶五年”的话了。
    现在这里的人们，对发展果树生产有了更大的兴趣，他们已决定明年再栽苹果、桃、葡萄等果树二万一千棵，还计划培育海棠、梨等苗圃三十亩。  （石正章、陈立言）
