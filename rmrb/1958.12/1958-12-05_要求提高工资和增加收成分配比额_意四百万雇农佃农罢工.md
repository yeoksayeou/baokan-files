    Demanding Higher Wages and Increased Share of Harvest
    4 Million Farmhands and Tenant Farmers in Italy Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 3rd: A large-scale strike movement continues in Italy. Approximately four million farmhands and sharecroppers began a two-day general strike on the 3rd. The striking farmhands are demanding higher wages, and the sharecroppers are demanding an increase in the portion of the harvest allocated to them, as well as negotiations for the conclusion of new collective contracts with the participation of union representatives.
    On the 2nd, workers in Brescia Province (a major agricultural and industrial area) also went on strike to protest layoffs and to support demands for the implementation of policies aimed at developing the province's economy.
    The general strike by 100,000 medical personnel in Italian hospitals, which began on the 1st, was still continuing on the 3rd.
    Newspapers reported that the crews of civilian merchant ships in some of Italy's largest ports achieved victory after several days of strikes. They forced the company authorities to cancel the decision to suspend voyages (a decision made to suppress sailors' demands for improved living conditions) and began negotiations with sailors' representatives on raising wages.

    要求提高工资和增加收成分配比额
    意四百万雇农佃农罢工
    新华社4日讯  据塔斯社罗马3日讯：在意大利，继续进行声势浩大的罢工运动。约四百万雇农和对分佃农在3日开始为时两天的总罢工。罢工的雇农要求提高工资，对分佃农要求增加分配给他们的收成部分，并且要求在各工会代表参加下进行关于缔结新的集体合同的谈判。
    2日，布里西亚省（国家大工农业地区）的工人也举行了罢工，抗议解雇和支持人们要求执行旨在发展这个省的经济的政策。
    意大利各医院的十万名医务人员在1日开始的总罢工3日还在继续进行。
    报纸报道，意大利一些最大的港口的民航商船船员在进行了几天的罢工之后取得了胜利。他们迫使公司当局取消了停止航行的决定（这项决定是为了压服要求改善物质生活条件的海员而作的），并且同海员代表开始进行关于提高工资的谈判。
