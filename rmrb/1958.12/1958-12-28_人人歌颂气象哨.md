Everyone Sings Praises of Weather Observation Posts
Ye Chuanhe

In late October, I followed the Guiding County Committee inspection team of Hunan Province to the Xinhua People's Commune. From Qiaotou Township to Dadi Township, along the fifteen-li road of the commune, were plastered with big-character posters, door panel posters, and slogans. Among the more than 1,600 big-character posters, 20% were songs about the weather, praising the weather, mountain songs, rhymes, weather proverbs, and meteorological knowledge. The masses sang:

Old folks laugh, young folks laugh,
Children jump with joy;
Happy that the commune was formed yesterday,
Now weather observation posts are set up.

A seventy-seven-year-old commune member sang:

I am old, seventy-seven this year,
Never seen anything so good:
Knowing whether it will rain tomorrow or not,
Knowing whether tomorrow will be cloudy or sunny,
Knowing the weather for the next few days.
This is truly a good thing,
Makes this old man laugh to tears,
Makes this old man laugh his teeth out.

The entire commune had one hundred and twenty blackboard bulletins, about 10% of which were about weather. From the enthusiastic and inspiring songs of the masses, it can be seen that the weather work of this commune has truly reached every household, known to both the old and the young.

Why do the masses love weather work so much? Besides the fact that the weather observation post of this commune made timely, accurate, and vividly production-related weather forecasts, it was also because they used forms that the masses loved to see and hear to make weather forecasts. For example, the weather forecast for October 30th was written as follows:

Time: 10:30 PM, October 30th
Climate: Moon bright, stars sparse
Wind direction: North wind

	Song

Moon bright, stars sparse indicate long clear skies,
Grass and trees are dry, frost is near;
Harvest autumn crops and plant winter crops with extra effort,
Strive to launch large satellites.

Another example is the weather forecast for November 1st:

Time: 6:30 AM, November 1st
Climate: Sunny
Wind direction: North wind

	Song

Autumn comes, north wind brings sunny days,
Labor force must be seized tightly;
Deep plowing and autumn sowing before three o'clock,
Don't wait for the south wind to send rain.

The weather observation post produced such rich in content and vivid in form forecast poems every day. In addition to posting them near the commune, they also promptly transmitted them to the weather observation teams in each brigade by telephone. After receiving the forecasts, the weather observation teams promptly used the form of singing mountain songs to pass them on to the masses. After hearing the mountain songs, the masses also grasped the weather, and one person told ten, ten told a hundred, and it spread all at once. This vivid and lively form of carrying out weather work, combining weather forecasts, production arrangements, and folk mountain songs, how could the masses not welcome it? How could they not praise it?

After more than two months of exploration and practice in building the observation post, the Xinhua People's Commune has gained some experience in short-term forecasting. Now their interest has shifted to medium and long-term forecasting. In order to facilitate production planning, the commune party committee proposed in September this year to study the climate this winter. According to this instruction, the weather observation post gave play to the communist spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and boldly conducted research and discussion on the climate this winter together with the old farmers. Based on the experience of the old farmers, the observation of climate phenomena, and seasonal calculations, they concluded that this year is a "Qingfeng" year, meaning that this winter will be colder earlier than in previous years. The facts are the same as their long-term forecast. According to this long-term forecast, the commune carried out production arrangements, strengthened the cultivation and management of autumn red beet, and this year their autumn red beet grows better than in the Guiding area. From Guiding to the Xinhua Commune, crossing Xiangtang Mountain, once entering the Xinhua Commune area, the autumn red beet is particularly large in leaves and thick in vines, strong and vigorous. Many have built trellises, and the ridges below can be seen to be cracked by the growing red beet.

What do we see from the weather work of the Xinhua People's Commune? We see this truth: once meteorological science is mastered by the masses and closely integrated with production, it can play a huge role that is difficult to imagine. In the past, those of us who do weather work had deep superstitious thoughts. Some people believe that agricultural meteorology is a new science, without experts, college students, and complete sets of instruments, experimental research cannot be carried out, and no results can be achieved. Many farmers also believe that weather work is the business of scientists, very mysterious, and farmers are crude and cannot do it. In fact, agriculture and meteorology are inseparable. Farmers have been planting fields for generations, and they have also been observing the weather for generations, and they can also master the laws of climate change, except that they use local methods. The achievements of the Xinhua Commune eloquently demonstrate that the farmers' weather observation posts can not only use "local" methods to make short-term forecasts, but also use "local" methods to make medium and long-term forecasts. Those who believe that weather observation posts can only play the role of transmitting forecasts, cannot make forecasts, and have no conditions to make medium and long-term forecasts should learn from the facts of the Xinhua People's Commune, liberate their minds, and correct their views.

    人人歌颂气象哨 
    叶传鹤
    10月下旬，我跟随湖南省桂东县委检查团到新华人民公社。从桥头乡到大地乡，在沿公社的十五里路上，都贴满了大字报、门板报、标语。在一千六百多张大字报中，有20％是歌唱气象，赞美气象的山歌、顺口溜、天气谚语和气象知识等。群众这样唱道：
    老也笑、幼也笑，
    少年儿童喜得跳；
    喜得昨天公社化，
    现在又办气象哨。一位七十七岁的老社员唱道：
    我老倌，今年七十七，
    唔（不）曾见过咯（这）样好东西：
    晓得明天下雨不下雨，
    晓得明天阴和晴，
    晓得明后几天的天气。
    咯样硬是好东西，
    把我老汉笑得出眼泪，
    把我老汉笑脱了牙齿。
    全公社有一百二十块黑板报，约有10％是气象方面的内容。从群众这种热情奔放、激动人心的歌唱中，可以看出，这个社的气象工作，真正做到了家喻户晓，老幼皆知。
    群众为什么这样热爱气象工作呢？除了这个公社的气象哨及时做出了准确、生动、紧紧结合生产的气象预报外，还因为他们利用群众喜闻乐见的形式进行了天气预报。如10月30日的天气预报写道：
    时间：10月30号下午10时半
    气候：月朗星稀
    风向：北风
        歌唱
    月朗星稀象久晴，
    草木枯燥霜气临；
    秋收冬种加劲干，
    争取发射大卫星。再如11月1日的天气预报：
    时间：11月1号上午6点半
    气候：晴
    风向：北风
        歌唱
    秋来北风日日晴，
    劳力特别要抓紧；
    深耕秋种三杆下，
    莫待南风送雨淋。
    像这样内容丰富、形式生动的预报诗歌，气象哨每天作出来后，除了在公社附近张贴以外，同时及时用电话传向各营的看天小组。各看天小组收到预报后，及时利用唱山歌的方式传递给群众。群众听了山歌，也就掌握了天气，一传十，十传百，一下子就唱开了。这种用天气预报、生产安排、民间山歌三者结合的生动活泼的形式来开展气象工作，群众怎么不欢迎呢？怎么不赞美呢？
    经过建哨两个多月来的摸索、实践，新华人民公社对短期预报工作已经取得了一定的经验。现在他们的兴趣已经转移到中、长期预报方面来了。为了便于计划生产，今年9月间公社党委提出研究一下今冬的气候。气象哨按照这个指示，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义精神，与老农一起，大胆地对今冬的气候进行了研究探讨。根据老农的经验、观察气候的征象和按季节进行推算等，得出的结论是：今年是“清风”年头，即今年冬天要比往年冷得早。事实和他们的长期预报一样。公社根据这个长期预报，进行了生产布置，对秋红茹加强了培育、加强了管理，今年他们的秋红茹比桂东地区的长得好。从桂东到新华公社一路走去，翻过向膛山，一进入新华公社地区，秋红茹就格外显得叶大藤粗，健壮有劲。有许多都搭起了藤架，下面的畦丘，可以看到有些都被成长着的红茹挤得裂开了缝。
    从新华人民公社气象工作的情况，我们看到什么呢？我们看到这样一条真理，那就是：气象科学一旦被群众所掌握，与生产紧密结合，就能够发挥出难以想像的巨大作用。过去，我们作气象工作的人，有很深的迷信思想。有些人认为，农业气象是一门新的科学，没有专家、大学生，没有成套仪器，就不能进行试验研究，就搞不出成绩。也有不少的农民认为，搞气象是科学家的事，很神秘，农民是大老粗，搞不来。其实，农业和气象是不可分离的，农民群众种了几辈子的田，也就观测了几辈子的气象，也能掌握气候变化的规律，只不过他们所用的是土办法罢了。新华公社的成就雄辩地说明：农民的气象哨不但能够用“土”法作出短期预报，而且能够用“土”法作出中长期预报。那些认为气象哨只能起传递预报作用，不能作预报，更没有条件作中长期预报的条件论、怀疑论者，应从新华人民公社的事实中吸取教益，解放思想，纠正看法。（附图片）
