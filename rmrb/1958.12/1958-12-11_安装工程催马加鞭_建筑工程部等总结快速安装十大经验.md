Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 10th: The Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Ministry of Chemical Industry recently held a national installation experience exchange meeting in Lanzhou. The meeting believed that rapid construction must be vigorously promoted in installation projects to ensure that installation and civil engineering proceed side by side, so that newly built modern enterprises can be completed and put into production as soon as possible.

The meeting pointed out that under the situation of the overall Great Leap Forward, in terms of capital construction, civil engineering has already found a good way to leap forward, that is, vigorously promoting rapid construction; a workshop that used to take half a year to build can now be built in just a few dozen days or even a few dozen hours. However, the installation work of production equipment, which is the heart of modern enterprises, has not kept up. In the country, there are still many people who have a technical mystery concept regarding installation work.

After twelve days of discussion and research, the meeting criticized the technical mysticism in installation work, and decided to launch a mass movement to push the rapid installation work to a climax nationwide.

The meeting focused on summarizing the experience of Lanzhou Chemical Plant in achieving overall rapid construction in installation and civil engineering. Lanzhou Chemical Plant is a large modern enterprise, with a scale comparable to that of Jilin Chemical Plant, which was put into production last year. The six units participating in the construction of this plant, under the leadership of the Party committee, implemented communist-style collaboration, vigorously launched mass movements, and comprehensively promoted the experience of rapid installation and civil engineering. Therefore, it only took one year and two months from the start of installing process equipment to putting it into production, which was one and a half years ahead of the national plan requirements. The project quality was good, and the construction investment was also 23.6% lower than that of Jilin Chemical Plant; while Jilin Chemical Plant took two years and three months.

Representatives from Beijing Industrial Equipment Installation Company, Thirty-Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and other units also introduced their experiences in promoting rapid construction in the installation of equipment in steel, electricity, machinery and other enterprises at the meeting. Based on the experiences of these enterprises and Lanzhou Chemical Plant, the meeting summarized ten better practices and called on installation units across the country to actively promote them in the course of vigorously promoting rapid construction. These ten methods are:

一、Accelerating the construction of modern enterprises in capital construction is the result of the joint efforts of both civil engineering and installation. Therefore, the overall concept must be strengthened. In the past, civil engineering emphasized the importance of civil engineering, and installation proposed installation as the main focus. Such practices are not comprehensive. The correct approach should be: collaborate together, all for the purpose of putting the new enterprise into production as soon as possible.

二、Many units participate in the construction of a modern enterprise. In terms of installation, there are mechanical installation, electrical installation, pipeline, line, and instrument installation, etc.; plus the civil engineering construction unit, it is even more complex. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a unified construction headquarters to implement unified planning, unified command, and unified dispatch.

三、The unified construction headquarters is led by the Party committee, using the collective leadership of the Party committee and actively following the mass line to replace the past simple expert line. When commanding construction and handling contradictions between various units, political accounts should be calculated first, followed by economic accounts; overall accounts should be calculated first, followed by local accounts.

四、Concentrate superior forces to fight annihilation battles, win one battle, and immediately organize the next battle.

五、Adopt a three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operation method to change the past construction routines; construction of multiple types of work and multiple work procedures of installation and civil engineering should be carried out simultaneously up and down, left and right, in a factory building or the same area.

六、Launch mass technical innovation campaigns and mobilize workers to vigorously develop machinery, tools, and fixtures.

七、Replace single prefabrication with comprehensive prefabrication, combining the installation of pipelines, electrical equipment, etc. with prefabricated boards and beams in civil engineering to form comprehensive prefabricated products, which can be installed at once to reduce installation procedures and speed up progress.

八、Adopt a combination of mechanized construction and indigenous machinery in installation to make up for the shortage of construction machinery in vigorously promoting rapid construction.

九、Construction and installation units should rely on their own efforts to manufacture some equipment and non-standard equipment, so as to gain more initiative in rapid construction and avoid work stoppages waiting for materials.

十、Vigorously cultivate "all-rounders" so that installation workers can play a greater role in three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operations.

Representatives from construction installation and chemical systems from various provinces and cities, as well as some representatives from the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, attended this conference.

    安装工程催马加鞭
    建筑工程部等总结快速安装十大经验
    据新华社兰州10日电  建筑工程部和化学工业部最近在兰州召开了全国安装经验交流会。会议认为在安装工程中必须大搞快速施工，使安装和土建齐头并进，保证新建的现代化企业能尽快建成和投入生产。
    会议指出，在全面大跃进的形势下，在基本建设方面的土建工程上，已经找到了跃进的好门路，那就是大搞快速施工；过去要半年建成的一个车间，现在只要几十天甚至几十个小时就能建成。但是作为现代化企业的心脏——生产设备的安装工作，却没有迎头赶上，在全国范围内，还有不少人对安装工作存在技术神秘观念。
    会议经过十二天的讨论研究，批判了安装工作中的技术神秘论，决定大搞群众运动，把快速安装工作在全国范围内推向高潮。
    会议着重总结了兰州化工厂安装、土建全面快速施工的经验。兰州化工厂是一个现代化的大企业，规模同去年投入生产的吉林化工厂相当。参加建设这个厂的六个单位由于在党委领导下实行了共产主义大协作，大搞群众运动，全面推广了安装和土建快速施工的经验，因而从开始安装工艺设备到投入生产，只花了一年零两个月的时间，比国家计划要求提前了一年半，工程质量良好，建设投资也比吉林化工厂降低23.6％；而吉林化工厂却用了两年零三个月的时间。
    来自北京工业设备安装公司、水利电力部三十三工程处等单位的代表，在会上还介绍了在钢铁、电力、机械等企业设备安装中推行快速施工的经验。会议根据这些企业和兰州化工厂的经验，总结出了十条较好的做法，号召全国安装单位在大搞快速施工当中，积极加以推行。这十条办法是：
    一、在基本建设中加快建设现代化企业，是土建和安装两方面共同努力的结果，因此必须加强整体观念。过去土建方面强调土建的重要性，安装方面提出以安装为主，这样的做法都欠全面。正确的做法应该是：共同协作，一切为了使新建企业早日投入生产。
    二、参加一个现代化企业建设的单位很多，在安装方面有机械安装，电气安装，管道、线路、仪表的安装等；加上土建施工单位，更为庞杂。因此，需要建立统一施工指挥部，实行统一计划、统一指挥、统一调度。
    三、统一施工指挥部由党委挂帅，以党委的集体领导和积极走群众路线，来代替过去的单纯的专家路线。在指挥施工和处理各单位间发生的矛盾时，应该先算政治账，后算经济账；先算整体账，后算局部账。
    四、集中优势兵力打歼灭战，打赢一仗，立即组织下一仗。
    五、采用立体交叉平行流水作业法，改变过去的施工常规；要在一个厂房或同一区域内，上下左右同时进行安装和土建的多工种、多工序施工。
    六、展开群众性的技术革新运动，发动工人大搞机具、工具和台具。
    七、以综合预制代替单一预制，把管线、电气等的安装和土建上的预制板、梁合在一起，做成综合预制品，一次进行安装，可以减少安装工序，加快进度。
    八、在安装中采取机械化施工和土法机具并举的办法，弥补大搞快速施工中施工机械的不足。
    九、建筑安装单位要自力更生制造部分器材和非标准设备，在快速施工中掌握更多的主动权，避免停工待料。
    十、大力培养“多面手”，使安装工人在立体交叉平行流水作业中发挥更多的作用。
    参加这次大会的有各省、市建筑安装和化工系统的代表，还有第一机械工业部、石油工业部和水利电力部系统的部分代表。
