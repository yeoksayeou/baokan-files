Xinhua News Agency, 10th -- The entire delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria visited the Central Revolutionary Museum this afternoon.

These distinguished guests from fighting Algeria saw here how the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, finally achieved revolutionary victory after a tortuous road. Here, the guests carefully viewed a large number of historical documents from various periods of the Chinese revolution, the weapons and other objects used by the revolutionary people to fight against domestic and foreign enemies, as well as many precious photos and pictures documenting the struggles of that time.

After the visit, Xu Binru, director of the preparatory office of the Central Revolutionary Museum, presented the guests with three gifts on behalf of the museum: a beautifully bound edition of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, a replica of a "bamboo mine," and a replica of a bamboo tube engraved with slogans. This bamboo tube contains such a moving and praiseworthy fact: In 1931, Deng Kaicheng, secretary of the Communist Youth League district committee of Pingjiang, Hunan, was surrounded by the enemy in a bamboo forest. Before sacrificing himself, Deng Kaicheng engraved the slogans "Complete Land Reform" and "Long Live the Success of the Chinese Revolution" on a bamboo pole to express his determination to carry the revolution through to the end. After the national liberation, the locals found this bamboo and sawed off the section with the slogans and sent it to the Central Revolutionary Museum. Today, when the envoys of the heroic Algerian people came to visit, the museum presented the guests with a replica of this bamboo tube, wishing them complete victory in their struggle.

After accepting the gifts, Minister Youssef Ben Khedda said to Xu Binru, "Your gifts symbolize the concern of the Chinese people for the Algerian people. After our country is completely liberated, we will definitely put these gifts in our national museum." He also said that seeing the path of the Chinese revolutionary forces from small to large to finally achieving final victory, we naturally think of the Algerian people's ongoing struggle for national liberation. The guests inscribed a message in the museum's guestbook, wishing the Chinese people complete victory in the anti-imperialist struggle.

The guests visited the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory this morning. The guests were warmly welcomed by Ma Fangting, Assistant Minister of Textile Industry, Feng Mailun, Director of the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and the workers. The guests talked with the workers and visited the cotton spinning and weaving production process, as well as the employee welfare facilities. Minister Youssef Ben Khedda said to the people accompanying them on the tour, "Everything we have seen in Beijing shows the rapid development of Chinese industry, and this development shows your powerful strength to imperialism."

    阿尔及利亚贵宾
    参观中央革命博物馆
    新华社10日讯  阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的全体贵宾今天下午参观了中央革命博物馆。
    这些来自战斗的阿尔及利亚的贵宾们，今天在中央革命博物馆看到了中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，如何经过迂回曲折的道路终于取得革命胜利的史实。在这里，贵宾们仔细地参观了中国革命各个时期的大量历史文献，革命的人民使用来同国内外敌人进行斗争的武器和其他实物，及以纪录当年斗争情况的许多珍贵照片和图画。
    参观以后，中央革命博物馆筹备处主任徐彬如代表博物馆向贵宾们赠送了三件礼品：精装的毛泽东选集，复制的“竹雷”和一个复制的刻着标语的竹筒。这个竹筒包含着这样一段令人可歌可颂的事实：1931年的一天，湖南平江共产主义青年团区委书记邓楷成被敌人围困在一个竹林里面，邓楷成同志在牺牲之前为了表示自己革命到底的决心，便在一根竹竿上刻下“完成土地改革”，“中国革命成功万岁”的标语。全国解放后，当地的人们发现了这竿竹，把刻着标语的一段锯下送到中央革命博物馆。今天当英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的使者来参观时，博物馆就把这个竹筒的复制品送给贵宾们，祝他们的斗争最后取得全部的胜利。
    优素福·本·赫达部长接受礼品后，向徐彬如说：“你们的礼品标志着中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的关怀，我们的国家全部解放后，我们一定要把这些礼品放进我们的国家博物馆。”他还说，看到了中国革命力量由小到大终于取得最后胜利的道路，我们就很自然地联想到阿尔及利亚人民正在进行的争取民族解放的斗争。贵宾们为博物馆题词，题词中祝愿中国人民在反帝斗争中取得完全的胜利。
    贵宾们在今天上午参观了北京第二棉纺织厂。贵宾们受到了纺织工业部部长助理马芳庭，北京第二棉纺织厂厂长冯迈伦和工人们的热烈欢迎。贵宾们和工人谈了话，参观了纺棉和织布的生产过程以及职工福利设施等。优素福·本·赫达部长向陪同他们参观的人们说：“我们在北京看到的一切东西，都说明中国工业的飞速发展，这种发展向帝国主义显示了你们强大的力量。”
