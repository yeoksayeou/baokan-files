Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd:

    In order to cooperate with commercial departments to ensure that urban and rural people have a good New Year's Day and Spring Festival, the Ministry of Railways has decided that before New Year's Day, all non-staple foods and daily necessities arriving at stations will be transported, no matter how much there is. In January of next year, the proportion of daily necessities loaded onto trains will be increased from the current 16.7% to about 20% to ensure that all kinds of daily necessities can be delivered to cities and the countryside in a timely manner.
    This decision was made at a joint telephone conference held by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Commerce on the 22nd. This conference was convened by the Ministry of Railways to exchange the experiences of various railway bureaus in transporting daily necessities. At the meeting, the Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Jinan Railway Bureaus reported on their experiences in vigorously tapping transportation potential and launching a crash program to transport non-staple foods during this period. Liu Jianzhang, Vice Minister of Railways, reiterated the importance of doing a good job in transporting people's daily necessities at the meeting. He demanded that railway departments at all levels conscientiously implement the central government's transportation policy of "guaranteeing key points and taking care of general needs" and do this work with the greatest possible effort.
    Liu Jianzhang said that according to reports from various places, as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and fully mobilizes the masses, many good methods will be created, and it will be possible to both guarantee key points and take care of general needs. The Shanghai Railway Bureau's experience of "marshals leading logistics" has been further developed after being promoted in other regions. For example, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has launched a "load cargo without asking for train cars" movement on this basis, fully utilizing the potential of various vehicles to load more cargo. Not only are the train cars used to load "marshal" materials also used to load "logistics" materials, but also returning empty cars, cabooses, baggage cars, empty passenger cars, and even locomotives are loaded with people's daily necessities when it does not hinder normal work, truly achieving "drill into any crack, load any space," increasing the daily loading capacity by the equivalent of more than forty train cars, basically eliminating the phenomenon of accumulated less-than-carload freight. In some places, not only are "marshal" and "logistics" materials matched and loaded at the shipping station, but also "logistics" materials are added at intermediate stations and transported to cities and industrial and mining areas together with the "marshal" materials. This new development is worth greatly promoting.
    Liu Jianzhang finally talked about some matters that must be paid attention to when implementing new loading methods.

### 保证大家过好元旦和春节  生活必需品有多少运多少

    保证大家过好元旦和春节
    生活必需品有多少运多少
    铁道部和商业部联合召开电话会议
    据新华社23日讯  为了配合商业部门保证城乡人民过好元旦和春节，铁道部决定在元旦以前凡是到站的副食品和日用生活必需品，有多少运多少；明年1月份生活必需品的装车比重要由目前的16.7％提高到20％左右，以保证各种生活用品及时地进城下乡。
    这个决定是铁道部和商业部在22日联合召开的电话会议上确定的。这次会议是铁道部为了交流各路局装运生活用品的经验而召开的。会上，西安、郑州、上海、济南等铁路局汇报了这一时期大力挖掘运输潜力，突击运输副食品的经验。铁道部副部长刘建章在会上再一次强调了做好人民生活用品调运工作的重要意义。他要求各级铁路部门认真贯彻中央提出的“保证重点、照顾一般”的运输方针，用最大的力量做好这一工作。
    刘建章说，根据各地的汇报，只要领导上重视，充分发动群众，就会创造出许多好的办法，可以做到既保证重点又能够照顾一般。上海铁路局创造的“元帅带后勤”的经验在其他地区推广后又有了新的发展。如西安铁路局在此基础上开展了充分利用各种车辆的潜力，不另要车皮，多装货物的“装货不要车运动”。不但充分利用装“元帅”物资的车皮配装“后勤”物资，而且把回空车、守车、行李车、空客车甚至机车，在不妨碍正常工作的情况下都装上了人民生活用品，真正做到“有缝就钻、有空就装”，每天可以多装相当于四十多个车皮的物资，基本上消灭了零担积压的现象。有的地方不但在发货站把“元帅”和“后勤”物资搭配，同时装上去，而且在中途站加装“后勤”物资，和“元帅”一同进城、一同进工矿区。这一新的发展值得大大推广。
    刘建章最后谈到在实行新装车方法时必须注意的一些事项。
