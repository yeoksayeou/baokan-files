"Wherever the secretary goes, victory follows!" Although this was said by a steelworker, it is also the sentiment of all working people. After the Party secretaries and committee members in the major wheat-producing areas of Hebei took charge in the fields, the field management of high-yield wheat fields immediately became active. Checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, topdressing fertilizer, and watering – the urgent needs of the wheat fields were met.

Managing wheat fields well is the top priority from now until June of next year. Only by managing wheat fields well can we achieve a bumper summer harvest next year, and only then can we guarantee an even greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

Next year, Hebei's agricultural production must have an even greater leap forward, and agricultural production in other places must also have an even greater leap forward. Therefore, it is hoped that Party secretaries at all levels will grasp this work tightly: "Secretaries take charge, strengthen management."

    一个要求
    “书记到哪里，哪里就胜利！”这虽是一个炼铁工人说的话，但也是全体劳动人民的体会。河北主要产麦区的党委书记、委员挂帅到田以后，麦子丰产田的田间管理工作立刻活跃起来，查苗、补苗、追肥、浇水，麦田的迫切要求得到了满足。
    管理好麦田，是从现在到明年6月的头等大事情，只有把麦田管理好了，才能得到明年的夏季大丰收，才可以保证明年农业生产有更大的跃进。
    明年，河北农业生产要有更大的跃进，别的地方的农业生产也要有更大的跃进。因此，希望各级党委书记都抓紧这项工作，“书记挂帅，加强管理。”
