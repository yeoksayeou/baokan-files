    Guarantee Absolute Party Leadership in Enterprises
    Guo Huizhong, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Jianhua Machinery Factory Committee
    The Struggle of Two Ideologies
    The issue of enterprise leadership has been a central topic of discussion among cadres and workers for a long time, and is the focal point of the struggle between two roads and two leadership systems.
    After the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee was clarified, and most comrades gained a deeper understanding of strengthening Party leadership and implementing the mass line. Since then, Party leadership has been greatly strengthened. However, the problem has not been completely solved, mainly manifested in: a set of old rules and regulations remained untouched at the time; the commandist leadership style was not completely overcome; especially in ideological understanding, there were still many problems, sometimes more hidden, and sometimes openly exposed. The main arguments were:
    1. With Party leadership at the top and mass supervision at the bottom, the play of individual roles is limited.
    2. Demands for the Party committee and administration to delineate their work scopes, reflecting that some people wanted the Party committee to implement limited leadership.
    3. Some technical personnel promoted that scientific research work is "high-level" labor and must be led by "experts," and that the Party is an "outsider" who cannot lead "insiders."
    The extensive development of the rectification movement and the in-depth promotion of the experience of "two participations, one reform" educated and improved our understanding with countless facts that the absolute leadership position of the Party must be thoroughly established. First, we must mobilize the masses to speak out freely, air views fully, and hold great debates.
    In February of this year, our factory held the Second Party Congress. The resolution of the congress required the design of two to three new products within three years. The news spread to the design institute, and the engineering and technical personnel were in an uproar, saying, "The design institute has insufficient equipment and a severe shortage of manpower. This requirement is 'too naive' and 'divorced from reality,' and cannot be achieved at all." They took the opportunity to demand the transfer of newly graduated college students to supplement professional designers, mechanical designers, and draftsmen, deliberately making things difficult for the leadership. At that time, a relatively active college student wrote a note saying that it would be enough to transfer two junior high school graduates to be trained for specialized calculation and drafting. The responsible engineer was very dissatisfied with this and said, "I'll keep this note for you," meaning that he would settle accounts with him later. The Party organization firmly grasped this opposing side and used various opportunities to launch debates, supporting and encouraging activists in the debate, and adjusting some technically proficient cadres and workers with firm political stance to strengthen the force, requiring them to quickly unite the majority of the masses and make achievements as quickly as possible. After a period of arduous struggle, overcoming various difficulties, so far, seven new products have been independently designed, and it is planned to design nine more by the end of the year. Now the conservatives are beginning to admit defeat. The tune that only experts can lead technology is no longer sung.
    Strengthen Political Education, Destroy the Old and Establish the New
    In the rectification and the Great Leap Forward in production, our factory's Party committee adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, using the abstract to lead the concrete, and combining the abstract with the concrete, and carried out a series of communist ideological education and political and ideological work.
    We used the methods of large-scale destruction, large-scale establishment, large-scale speaking out, large-scale airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates to carry out the struggle of two ideologies, two stances, and two methods, and to carry out socialist and communist ideological education.
    The essence of socialist and communist education is to enable the broad masses to politically eliminate capitalist thoughts, stances, methods, and living habits, and to establish communist thoughts, stances, methods, and living habits. Therefore, we must adopt mass-based methods of self-education and self-transformation such as large-scale destruction, large-scale establishment, large-scale speaking out, large-scale airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates. Based on this understanding, and based on the ideological problems existing among the workers and staff in our factory at different periods and the task requirements of the Party at various periods, we also proposed specifically what to destroy and what to establish. For example, after the start of the rectification and before the "double opposition," we focused on opposing individualism, liberalism, and extreme democracy among the workers and staff, so that the workers and staff could correctly understand the relationship between the individual and the country, freedom and discipline, democracy and centralism, and understand the position and tasks of the working class. In the "double opposition" movement and the promotion of "two participations, one reform," we focused on eliminating dogmatic thinking, the "three styles" and "five airs," and the lack of a sense of responsibility as masters, and establishing the idea of unified Party leadership, the mass line, and the "two participations, one reform, three combinations." In the Great Leap Forward in production and the large-scale mass movement, we focused on opposing distrust of the masses, right-leaning conservatism, departmentalism, "equilibrium theory," and "condition theory," and establishing communist ideology, style, and the viewpoint of believing in and relying on the masses. Recalling the past, if we summarize it, there are a total of ten destructions and ten establishments. These are: (1) Destroy inferiority complex and superstition, and establish daring to think and daring to act; (2) Destroy the hired labor viewpoint, and establish a communist attitude towards labor; (3) Destroy individualism and departmentalism, and establish collectivism and a sense of the whole; (4) Destroy the "three styles" and "five airs," and establish the mass line, democratic style, and the ideological style of hard work and plain living; (5) Destroy arbitrary decision-making, and establish the Party's collective leadership; (6) Destroy dogmatism, and establish seeking truth from facts; (7) Destroy right-leaning conservatism, slow, poor, and wasteful practices, and establish more, faster, better, and more economical practices; (8) Destroy the remnants of bourgeois rights, and establish communist ideals and the communist viewpoint of equality; (9) Destroy liberalism and decentralism, and establish consciousness and discipline; (10) Destroy the style of despising manual labor and irresponsibility, and establish the idea that the working class is the leading class of the country.
    In the process of speaking out, airing views, and debating, the leadership should guide the debate to the main issues based on the ideological situation of the masses and the principles of communism, and also make necessary guidance reports. This method is actually a method of relying on the masses themselves to educate themselves under leadership. Practice has proved that only by adopting this method can ideological work and the communist education movement be transformed into a mass self-education movement, and can problems be truly solved ideologically.
    Putting politics in command, using the abstract to lead the concrete, and conducting communist education to workers and staff by assigning production tasks and inspecting work. Our factory, from the Party committee, leading cadres, factory director, and various departments, to the workshop branches, and every worker, adhered to the principles of "putting politics in command, ideology leading the way, abstract first and concrete later, combining abstract and concrete," and the methods of "talking about ideology, discussing viewpoints, comparing methods, doing what is understood, debating what is not understood, and experimenting when unsure" when assigning work tasks, inspecting work, and executing any production tasks. When discussing the abstract, we focused on studying the international and domestic situation, the Party's guidelines and policies, the general line, and the significance of achieving the work tasks at that time for building socialism. The benefit of doing this is that it guarantees the smooth realization of production and work tasks, and also raises the socialist consciousness of the masses. For example, in July of this year, when the deputy director of production inspected and studied the trial production of two new products, he convened a meeting of workshop directors. At that time, due to poor cooperation between the workshops, everyone had complaints, which affected the completion of the production tasks. The deputy director of production did not talk about the tasks first at the meeting, but first "discussed the abstract" for an hour, and then talked about the tasks. In the process of discussing the abstract, everyone checked their own thoughts and actions based on the spirit of the general line and solved their ideological problems. As a result, the trial production tasks of these two new products were assigned very smoothly and were quickly successfully trial-produced.
    In short, strengthening political and ideological work, everyone putting politics in command, everyone talking about ideology, studying political theory, everyone being an educator and also being educated, is an extremely important aspect of ensuring the Party's absolute leadership in enterprises.
    Timely Presenting Struggle Goals to the Masses
    Before the rectification, we also carried out mass movements, but due to the constraints of various rules and regulations, there were more top-down arrangements and less bottom-up mobilization. The rectification movement liberated the minds of the masses, and the promotion of "two participations, one reform" broke through the rules and regulations that restricted the masses. Based on the principle of taking rectification as the key link and not delaying both rectification and production, we extensively carried out large-scale speaking out, large-scale airing of views, and great debates, which improved the political awareness of the masses and powerfully promoted production. However, because we did not deeply understand the significance and role of using the method of large-scale mass movements to lead production, we did not complete the production plan in July, and only completed 50% by August 20th. Under the pressure of this situation, another mass movement was launched. The Party committee summarized and checked the lessons of July with the masses, and put forward the battle slogan of "Surpassing August and Making Up for July." A vast and magnificent mass movement was launched within a day. In two days, 18 key points were broken through. The effect of seven days of hard work was equal to twice the effect of the first 20 days of August. In September, we took advantage of the victory to launch three campaigns, overfulfilling the monthly plan by 234%, which was equivalent to 51.9% of the annual plan last year. In October, we launched two more upsurges, and the workers' enthusiasm was even higher.
    We deeply realized that in front of the awakened working class, the greater the enthusiasm, the smaller the difficulties. As long as the enterprise leaders first muster up enthusiasm, liberate their minds, let go and mobilize the masses, and dare to put forward advanced struggle goals to the masses, and point out specific directions of effort, production can leap forward wave after wave.
    Developing "Two Participations" and Improving Leadership Style
    With the enhancement of the Party's leading role, the improvement of the communist ideological awareness of the workers and staff, and the promotion of large-scale mass movements, the "two participations, one reform" has also been continuously consolidated and developed; and the consolidation and development of the "two participations, one reform" has created conditions for enhancing the Party's leading role, promoting the double leap forward in production and thought, and carrying out large-scale mass movements. The two are complementary. Currently, our factory's "two participations, one reform" has new developments:
    1. Workers participate in design. This is a major development in workers' participation in technical management. Our factory has delegated the authority for workers to participate in the design of tools, fixtures, gauges, cutting tools, non-standard designs, and the handling of rationalization proposals to workshops and groups since the second quarter. Therefore, some people have participated in the design since then, but mass participation in design has gradually formed since the large-scale mass movement, the great technical revolution, and the large-scale development of simple equipment. Especially since the large-scale technical revolution and the comprehensive promotion of the experience of running the academy of sciences on a large scale, workers' participation in design and participation in technical leadership has taken another step forward.
    2. Implementing the mass line in planning and scheduling work. In the past, from the formulation to the organization and implementation of the plan, there was an obvious tendency to see things but not people, and to mechanically carry out balanced production. For example, in compiling work plans, emphasis was placed on mutual restraint and the control of administrative departments, and it was mechanically required to execute the work plan, not to do too much, not to do too little, not to be late, not to be early, etc., which constrained the development of productive forces and the initiative and creativity of the masses. In the rectification and large-scale mass movement, we constantly criticized mechanical equilibrium theory and right-leaning conservative thinking based on the Party's general line for socialist construction, and made more systematic reforms to planning work, implementing the mass line in planning work; that is, taking the production group as the basis for compiling and executing the plan, issuing reference indicators from top to bottom, and compiling the plan from bottom to top; the factory and workshop implement the "must-complete" and "scheduled-complete" two-bookkeeping plan. The group masters quotas, compiles production progress and technology, implements a system of long-term planning and short-term arrangements, and establishes direct contact between producers, between group dispatchers and dispatchers, mutual cooperation, and the upper process being responsible for the lower process, the lower process urging the previous process, and direct transmission without entering the warehouse, and other mass-based management and dispatching systems.
    3. In order to meet the needs of large-scale mass movements, the methods of cadres participating in labor have also been improved. According to the needs of cadres' labor training and leading production, a combination of fixed and unfixed methods was adopted, breaking the original overly rigid regulations.
    4. Implementing a rotation system for some cadres and workers. That is, a planned rotation of cadres and workers is implemented in some workshops. The method of counterpart rotation of worker dispatchers and workshop dispatchers, technicians and worker technicians, and groups (internal group leaders and workers, staff and staff, members and members) has already been implemented.
    5. The "three combinations" has been further implemented in production management and technical work, which has played a huge role in leading production and solving key technical problems. For example, the Sixth Workshop manufactured phosphorus machines. At first, it was only a few technicians working alone, and they did not succeed after half a year. Later, the workers challenged them and proposed a local method, which was also rejected by the technicians. After the Party committee discovered this situation, it helped them summarize the lessons, criticized the ideological style of blindly pursuing automation and mechanization and being divorced from the masses, and resolutely supported the workers' local methods, and proposed that the direction for solving the phosphorus machine problem must be first local and then foreign, combining local and foreign methods. After the technicians accepted the guidance of the Party and combined with the workers, they made a simple phosphorus machine in only half a day. A large number of facts have educated the technicians: any difficult problem can be quickly solved as long as they rely on the leadership of the Party and rely on the wisdom of the masses, and technology can be significantly developed. Otherwise, they will repeat the mistakes of being subjective, one-sided, and divorced from reality. After the workers participated in product design, they further eliminated superstition and liberated their minds. The workers unanimously believed that with the support of the Party and the help of everyone, our courage has grown and our enthusiasm is even greater. Practice has also educated the leading cadres and further realized that the technical line of "three combinations" and workers' participation in design is the embodiment of the Party's mass line in technical work. It is a characteristic of socialist enterprise technical management that distinguishes it from capitalist enterprise technical management, and is an inevitable trend after workers participate in management.
    6. In the group management work, the group "four packages" system was implemented, that is, package production, package management, package thought, and package life. In this way, group work is more comprehensive and truly becomes the most basic unit of political economy.
    From the above, it can be seen that the experience of "two participations, one reform" has not only been consolidated, but has also been greatly developed. Workers have developed from participating in a part of the daily management work of the group to mass-based comprehensive management. In a certain sense, these can be said to have undergone qualitative changes. This change is that the Party's absolute leadership has been established in the enterprise.

    保证党对企业的绝对领导
    中共建华机械厂委员会副书记  郭惠忠
    两种思想的斗争
    企业的领导问题，是干部和工人长期议论的中心，是两条道路、两种领导制度的斗争的焦点。
    党的全国第八次代表大会以后，明确了党委领导下的厂长负责制，多数同志对于加强党的领导和贯彻执行群众路线有了进一步的认识。从此，党的领导大大加强。但还是没有彻底解决问题，主要表现在：当时一套旧的规章制度仍然未动；命令主义的领导方法没有彻底克服；特别是在思想认识上还存在不少问题，有时比较隐蔽，有时又公开暴露出来。其主要论点是：
    1、上有党的领导，下有群众监督，限制了个人作用的发挥。
    2、要求党委和行政划清工作范围，反映出有人要党委实行有限的领导。
    3、一些技术人员宣扬科学研究工作是“高级”的劳动，必须由“专家”来领导，党是“外行”不能领导“内行”。
    整风运动的广泛开展，和“两参一改”经验的深入推行，无数的事实教育和提高了我们的认识，要彻底树立党的绝对领导地位。首先必须发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论。
    今年2月本厂召开第二次党代表大会，大会决议要求在三年内设计出二至三种新产品，消息传到设计所。工程技术人员们喧然大哗说：“设计所设备不足，人力奇缺，这个要求‘太天真’、‘脱离实际’，根本不能实现。”并借故提出要调新毕业的大学生补充专业设计人员、机械设计人员、制图人员，故意和领导为难。当时有一个比较积极的大学生写个条子说，调两个初中毕业生培养作专门计算和制图就可以了，负责的工程师对此大为不满，说：“这个条子我给你留着”，意思是等将来再和你算账。党组织紧紧抓住了这个对立面，利用各种机会展开了辩论，在辩论中支持、鼓励积极分子，并调整了一部分政治坚强、有实际经验的技术干部和工人，充实了力量，要求他们能迅速团结多数群众，用最快的速度作出成绩来。经过一番艰苦的奋斗，战胜了种种困难，到目前为止，已经独立设计七种新产品，并准备到年末再设计出九种。现在保守派开始认输了。强调专家才能领导技术的调子再也没有人唱了。
    加强政治教育大破大立
    在整风和生产大跃进中，我们厂党委坚持了政治挂帅，以虚带实，虚实并举的原则，进行了一系列的共产主义思想教育和政治思想工作。
    我们运用了大破、大立和大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，开展两种思想、两种立场和两种方法的斗争，进行社会主义和共产主义思想教育。
    社会主义和共产主义教育的实质是使广大群众在政治上破除资本主义的思想、立场、方法和生活习惯，树立共产主义的思想、立场、方法和生活习惯。因此必须采取大破、大立和大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的群众性的自我教育和自我改造的方法。在这种认识的基础上，根据我们厂各个不同时期职工中存在的思想问题和党在各个时期的任务要求，又提出具体破什么，立什么。比如，在整风开始后双反之前，我们在职工群众中，着重反对了个人主义、自由主义、极端民主，使职工正确地认识个人和国家、自由和纪律、民主和集中的关系，认识工人阶级的地位和任务。在双反运动和推行两参一改的过程中，着重破除教条主义思想、“三风”“五气”和缺乏主人翁责任感，立党的一元化领导、群众路线和两参一改三结合的思想。在生产大跃进和大搞群众运动中，我们着重反对了不相信群众、右倾保守、本位主义、“均衡论”、“条件论”，立共产主义思想、风格和相信群众依靠群众的观点。回忆过去，如果把它归纳起来总共有十破十立。这就是：（1）破自卑、迷信，立敢想敢干；（2）破雇佣观点，立共产主义的劳动态度；（3）破个人主义和本位主义，立集体主义和整体观念；（4）破“三风”“五气”，立群众路线民主作风和艰苦朴素的思想作风；（5）破独断独行，立党的集体领导；（6）破教条主义，立实事求是；（7）破右倾保守、少慢差费，立多快好省；（8）破资产阶级法权残余观念，立共产主义理想和共产主义的平等观点；（9）破自由主义和分散主义，立自觉性和纪律性；（10）破轻视体力劳动、不负责任的作风，立工人阶级是国家领导阶级的思想。
    在鸣放辩论过程中，领导上要根据群众思想情况和共产主义的原则，把争论引导到主要问题上，同时还要做必要的辅导报告。这种方法实际上是有领导地依靠群众自己教育自己的方法。实践证明，只有采取这种方法，才能使思想工作，共产主义教育运动变成群众性的自我教育运动，才能真正从思想上解决问题。
    政治挂帅，以虚带实，通过布置生产任务和检查工作向职工进行共产主义教育。我们厂从党委、领导干部、厂长和各科室，到车间支部，以及每个工人，在布置工作任务、检查工作和执行任何生产任务时，都坚持了“政治挂帅、思想领先、先虚后实、虚实并举”的原则，和“谈思想、论观点、比方法，通者就办、不通就辩论、没把握就试验”的方法。在论虚时，着重研究国际和国内形势，党的方针政策、总路线和实现当时的工作任务对于建设社会主义的意义。这样做的好处是：既保证了生产和工作任务顺利的实现，又提高了群众的社会主义觉悟。例如：今年7月生产副厂长检查和研究两种新产品的试制工作时，召开了各车间主任会议，当时由于各车间互相配合的不好，都有埋怨情绪，影响生产任务的完成。生产副厂长在开会时不是先谈任务，而是先“论虚”一小时，后谈任务。在论虚的过程中大家都根据总路线的精神，检查了自己的思想行动解决了思想问题，于是这两种新产品试制任务很顺利的布置下去了，并很快就试制成功了。
    总之，加强政治思想工作，人人政治挂帅，人人谈思想、学习政治理论，人人是教育者又是被教育者，这是保证党对企业的绝对领导权的一个极其重要的方面。
    及时向群众提奋斗目标
    整风以前我们也开展过群众运动，但是因为各种规章制度的约束，自上而下的布置多、自下而上的发动少。整风运动解放了群众的思想，“两参一改”的推行冲破了限制群众的清规戒律。根据整风为纲，整风生产两不误的原则，广泛开展大鸣、大放、大辩论，提高了群众的政治觉悟，有力地推动了生产。但由于我们对于运用大搞群众运动的方法领导生产的意义和作用还体会不深，7月份没有完成生产计划，8月20号也只完成了50％，在这种形势的逼迫下，又发动了一个群众运动，党委向群众总结和检查了7月份的教训，并提出“超八补七”的战斗口号，一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的群众运动，一天之内即发动起来了，两天的时间即突破了十八个关键，七天苦战的效果等于8月前二十天的两倍，9月份又乘胜发动了三个战役，超额完成月计划的234％，相等于去年全年计划的51.9％。10月份又发动了两个高潮，工人情绪更加高涨。
    我们深深地体会到，在觉悟了的工人阶级面前：干劲越大、困难就越小。只要企业领导人员首先鼓足干劲，解放思想，放手发动群众，敢于向群众提出先进的奋斗目标，指明具体的努力方向，就能使生产一浪高一浪的飞跃前进。
    发展“两参”改进领导作风
    随着党的领导作用的增强，职工共产主义思想觉悟的提高和大搞群众运动的推动，“两参一改”也不断得到了巩固与发展；而“两参一改”的巩固与发展，又为增强党的领导作用，促进生产、思想双跃进和大搞群众运动创造了条件。两者是相辅相成的，目前我厂的“两参一改”又有新发展：
    1、工人参加设计。这是工人参加技术管理方面的重大发展。我厂对工人参加工、卡、量、刃、具、非标准设计和合理化建议处理权限，从二季度起就下放到车间、小组，所以从那时起就有一部分人参加了设计，但群众性的参加设计，还是从大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，大搞简易设备以来才逐步形成的，尤其从大搞技术革命，全面推广大办科学院经验后，工人参加设计，参加技术领导，才又前进了一步。
    2、实行计划、调度工作群众化。过去的计划从制订到组织执行，有着明显的见物不见人、机械地搞均衡生产，例如编制作业计划，强调互相制约和行政部门管理的控制，机械地要求按作业计划执行，不许多，不许少，不许晚，不许早等等，束缚着生产力的发展和群众积极性、创造性的发挥。在整风和大搞群众运动中，我们依据党的社会主义建设总路线，不断的批判了机械均衡论和右倾保守思想，对计划工作作了较系统的改革，实行计划工作群众化；即以生产小组作为编制执行计划的基础，自上而下地下达参考指标，自下而上的编制计划；厂与车间实行“必成”、“期成”二本账计划。小组掌握定额，编制生产进度与工艺，实行长计划、短安排的制度，生产中建立了生产者与生产者之间，小组调度员与调度员之间，直接联系挂钩，互相协作和上道工序对下道工序负责，后道工序催前道工序，直接传送不入库等等群众性的管理和调度制度。
    3、为了适应大搞群众运动的需要，干部参加劳动的方式也有所改进。根据干部劳动锻炼和领导生产的需要，采取了固定和不定相结合的办法，打破了原来过于死板的规定。
    4、实行了部分干部和工人的轮换制。即有计划的在一部分车间里实行干部和工人轮换。现在已经施行了工人调度员与车间调度员，技术员与工人技术员和小组（内部小组长与工人、干事与干事、员和员）的对口轮换办法。
    5、在生产管理和技术工作方面进一步实行了三结合，这在领导生产和解决技术关键问题上，发挥了巨大的力量。例如六车间制造黄磷机，最初只是几个技术人员单干，搞了半年也未成功，后来工人和他们唱对台戏，提出了一个土办法，也被技术人员拒绝了。党委发现这种情况后，帮助他们总结了教训，批判了盲目追求自动化、机械化，脱离群众的思想作风，坚决支持了工人的土办法，提出了解决黄磷机问题的方向必须是先土后洋、土洋并举。当技术人员接受了党的指导和工人结合起来后，仅用半天时间，就搞成了一台简易的黄磷机。大量的事实教育了技术人员：任何难题，只要依靠党的领导，依靠群众的智慧，就能很快的得到解决，技术也就能得到显著的发展，反之，就会重犯主观、片面、脱离实际的毛病。工人参加产品设计后，更加破除了迷信，解放了思想。工人们一致认为：有党的支持和大家的帮助，我们的胆子大了，干劲更足了。实践也教育了领导干部，进一步认识到三结合和工人参加设计这条技术路线，就是党的群众路线在技术工作上的体现。是社会主义企业技术管理区别于资本主义企业技术管理的特征，是工人参加管理后必然的趋势。
    6、在小组管理工作方面，实行了小组“四包”制度，即包生产、包管理、包思想、包生活。这样小组工作就更加全面了，真正成为政治经济的最基层的单位。
    综合上述情况可以看出，“两参一改”的经验，不仅巩固了，而且有很大的发展，工人已经由参加小组一部分日常管理工作，发展到群众性的全面管理，这些在某种意义上讲可以说是起了质的变化，这种变化，就是党的绝对领导已经在企业里树立起来了。
