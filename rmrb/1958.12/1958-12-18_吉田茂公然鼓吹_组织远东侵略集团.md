Xinhua News Agency, December 17th, Tokyo dispatch: Former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida published an article in the "Industrial Economics News," openly advocating that Japan take the lead in establishing a so-called "Far East Treaty Organization" aggression bloc in the Western Pacific region.

Yoshida's article on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is cheerleading for the war conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The United States and the Nobusuke Kishi government are intensifying negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," attempting to expand the so-called "common defense area" to the entire Western Pacific in order to piece together a Northeast Asian war bloc, which has been widely condemned by the Japanese people.

Yoshida said that the "Far East Treaty Organization," an anti-communist bloc equivalent to the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," should include the Philippines, the Chiang Kai-shek group, and others along the West Pacific coast.

    吉田茂公然鼓吹
    组织远东侵略集团
    新华社17日讯  东京消息：日本前首相吉田茂在“产业经济新闻”上发表文章，公然鼓吹要日本带头在西太平洋地区成立所谓“远东条约组织”的侵略集团。
    吉田的这篇关于修改日美“安全条约”的文章是为美日反动派的战争阴谋摇旗呐喊。美国和岸信介政府正在加紧进行关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，企图把所谓“共同防御地区”扩大到整个西太平洋，以便拼凑一个东北亚战争集团，因而遭到日本人民的广泛谴责。
    吉田说，“远东条约组织”这个相当于“北大西洋公约组织”的反共集团，应该包括西太平洋沿岸的菲律宾、蒋介石集团等。
