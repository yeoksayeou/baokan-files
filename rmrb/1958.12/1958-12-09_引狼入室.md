Letting the Wolf In
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The activities of the United States and Iran in concluding an aggressive bilateral military agreement have aroused legitimate concern among the countries concerned and the people of all countries. The Soviet government issued a statement warning the Iranian government about this. The Iraqi ambassador to the United Arab Republic expressed deep concern after pointing out that this agreement is a direct threat to Iraq. People of all countries, especially the people of the Middle East, have condemned the unwise behavior of the Iranian government, which endangers the security of neighboring countries and harms the interests of the Iranian people. People originally expected that the Iranian government would draw the necessary conclusions from these legitimate reactions and seriously consider the consequences of forming a military alliance with the United States, the most ferocious imperialist. However, responsible persons in the Iranian government have adopted a completely opposite attitude. They initially denied that there were activities to conclude a US-Iran military agreement. Iranian Foreign Minister Hekmat even insisted in the Iranian Senate that there was no military agreement signed between the United States and Iran, nor was there any intention to sign such an agreement. Only nine days later, this same Foreign Minister, in the same place, actually said that Iran would conclude a military agreement with the United States despite the Soviet warning. Recently, the stubborn attitude of Iranian government officials has further developed. On December 6, a senior Iranian government official, in a conversation with a United Press International reporter, declared that "nothing can change" Iran's "decision" to conclude a military agreement with the United States. On December 7, the Iranian Foreign Ministry even lodged a "protest" with Iraq regarding the remarks made by the Iraqi Ambassador to the United Arab Republic. It seems that some people in the Iranian ruling clique are determined to let the wolf in.

Iranian government officials claim that the military agreement they want to conclude with the United States is "defensive" and repeatedly imply in their speeches that it is to "defend" against "threats" from the Soviet Union or Iraq. This is a complete lie! What facts can prove that the Soviet Union has posed any threat to Iran's security? No, the Iranian side cannot even provide any. As for Iraq, it must be pointed out here that what exists today is not any threat from Iraq to Iran's security, but rather Iraq suffering from Iran's threat.

Some people in the Iranian ruling clique also spread the argument that Iran cannot maintain neutrality because neutrality cannot protect Iran's security, so it must ally with the United States and seek the protection of the United States. This is a very strange argument, equivalent to saying that sheep must seek the protection of wolves. Isn't this the truth? Who is painstakingly trying to monopolize Iran's oil? Who is plotting to abolish the Iranian King and subvert the current Iranian regime simply because the Iranian King is unwilling to give up all of Iran's oil resources? Last year, the Iranian King strongly criticized the shameless behavior of American oil consortiums in exerting pressure on the Iranian government. When the Iranian government announced the cracking of a conspiracy to subvert the government in February this year, the entire country of Iran knew that this was the work of the devilish hand of the United States. The Iranian ruling clique is so forgetful of such vivid facts! Now, before the US-Iran military agreement has been formally announced, there is already news that the giants of the American oil monopoly organization have met to discuss the possibilities for the American oil companies to engage in extensive activities under this agreement; and they have also reached an agreement with the Pentagon that the Persian Gulf region obtained under this military agreement will be declared a strategic area, prohibiting the activities of all non-American foreigners, in order to prevent the forces of other countries' oil companies from entering Iran. Seeking the "protection" of the United States not only increases the danger of involving Iran in American military adventures, but also "protects" all of Iran's oil resources into the pockets of American oil giants. Is there any doubt about this?

For the Iranian ruling clique, letting the wolf in will certainly not have any good results.

    引狼入室
    本报评论员
    美国和伊朗缔结侵略性的双边军事协定的活动，引起了有关国家和各国人民理所应有的不安。苏联政府为此发表声明向伊朗政府提出警告；伊拉克驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使在指出这一协定是对伊拉克的直接威胁后，表示深为忧虑。各国人民特别是中东人民，纷纷谴责伊朗政府这种既危及邻国安全又损害伊朗人民利益的不智行为。人们本来期望伊朗政府会从这些正当的反应中得出应有的结论，认真考虑同美国这样一个最凶恶的帝国主义者缔结军事联盟将造成的后果。但是，伊朗政府的负责人士却采取了完全相反的态度。他们最初矢口抵赖有缔结美伊军事协定的活动，伊朗外交大臣赫克马特甚至在伊朗参议院硬说美国和伊朗之间既没有签订什么军事协定，也不准备签订这样一个协定。隔了仅仅九天，这同一位外交大臣，在同一个地方，竟又说伊朗将不顾苏联的警告而同美国缔结军事协定。最近，伊朗政府人士的顽固态度更有所发展。12月6日，一位伊朗政府高级人士在向合众国际社记者的谈话中，扬言“没有任何东西能改变”伊朗同美国缔结军事协定的“决定”。12月7日，伊朗外交部竟然就伊拉克驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使的谈话向伊拉克提出“抗议”。看来，伊朗统治集团的某些人士决心引狼入室。
    伊朗政府人士口口声声说他们要同美国缔结的军事协定是“防御性”的，并且在他们的言论中一再暗示是为的要“防御”来自苏联或伊拉克的“威胁”。这真是弥天大谎！有什么事实可以证明苏联对伊朗的安全进行了任何威胁吗？没有，伊朗方面自己也提不出来。至于伊拉克，那么，这里必须指出，今天所存在的并不是伊拉克对伊朗的安全进行了任何威胁，而是伊拉克遭受了伊朗的威胁。
    伊朗统治集团的某些人士还散播这样的论调，似乎伊朗不能保持中立，因为中立并不能保护伊朗的安全，所以必须同美国结盟，寻求美国的保护。这是一种非常奇怪的论调，就等于说绵羊必须寻求豺狼的保护。难道事实不是这样的吗？是谁处心积虑地要独占伊朗的石油？是谁仅仅因为伊朗国王还不愿意断送全部的石油资源，便阴谋废除伊朗国王、颠复伊朗现政权？伊朗国王在去年曾经对美国石油财团对伊朗政府施加压力的无耻行为大加抨击。伊朗政府在今年2月宣布破获颠复政府的阴谋案时，伊朗全国上下无不知道这是美国的魔手在作怪。这样活生生的事实，伊朗统治集团何其如此健忘！现在，美伊军事协定尚未正式公布，就已经有消息说美国大石油垄断组织的巨头们开会讨论了这个协定给美国石油公司提供广泛活动的可能；他们并且已经和五角大楼谈妥，根据这个军事协定弄到手的波斯湾地区将被宣布为战略地区，禁止一切非美国的外国人的活动，以阻止其他国家的石油公司的势力进入伊朗。寻求美国的“保护”，不仅增加了使伊朗卷入美国的军事冒险中去的危险，而且连伊朗的全部石油资源也被“保护”进美国石油巨头们的口袋中去，这一点难道还有什么可怀疑的吗？
    对伊朗统治集团说来，引狼入室，也是肯定不会有什么好结果的。
