Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council's afternoon session on the 17th continued to discuss what is known as the "cracks in the armor" of this aggressive military group -- the contradictions among member states in military affairs.

According to information revealed from the meeting, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the American General Norstad, spoke again, urging other countries to step up their arms expansion. He "strongly appealed" to member states to fulfill their "military obligations" and "reproached" some members for "promising more than they contributed." Norstad also spoke about the establishment of intermediate-range missile bases, expressing the hope that missile launch facilities and atomic weapons bases would be established in Western European countries as soon as possible. Sources say that Norstad's words were aimed at the majority of member states, especially France, which had not carried out military expansion activities according to the American plan.

Norstad's speech was essentially a repetition of the speech made by U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy at the morning session that day.

French Army Minister Guillaumat showed obvious dissatisfaction with the American pressure. Guillaumat complained that France was not choosing an "easy path," and that in France's situation, the Algerian situation was dominant, requiring "considerable effort." He also said that among all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France's efforts in terms of manpower were the "greatest," with one million active personnel and a service period of twenty-six and a half months. France has already spent 9% of its gross national income on military affairs, and its "defense efforts" within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are second only to the United States.

Guillaumat also complained that French taxes were already high, and the French government had to "maintain a balance" between the "obligations" it had to bear within and outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Representatives of other countries spoke one after another, expressing hesitation about the arms expansion plan orchestrated by the United States, which "includes various additional sacrifices."

News reports said that after discussion, the meeting reached an agreement on the "minimum" military needs of this military group, and drafted a resolution on the 1959 arms expansion targets, which would be discussed again before drafting the final communique of the three-day meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council on the morning of the 18th. The meeting touched on the "ultimate goal" of this military group - weapons standardization and the merger of armed forces - but to no avail.

After a brief recess, the Council moved on to discuss issues such as the Far East, the Near East, and the Mediterranean region. The military group spent two hours discussing the aggressive policies of its member states in the above-mentioned regions. Dulles gave a report on the United States' policy towards China and the Far East at the meeting.

The morning session on the 18th adopted a resolution on military issues. The resolution stated that there are still "considerable shortcomings" in the fulfillment of military obligations by the North Atlantic Group countries. The resolution instructed the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Group, Spaak, to go to the capitals of various countries as soon as possible to discuss with the governments of those countries the "difficulties they face in fulfilling their obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" and submit a report at the Council meeting to be held in Washington next April. This resolution itself shows that the United States' plan to whip many Western European countries into stepping up arms expansion and war preparations has encountered many difficulties.

### 北大西洋集团盔甲裂缝难修补  美国驱策伙伴加紧备战引起伙伴不满

    北大西洋集团盔甲裂缝难修补
    美国驱策伙伴加紧备战引起伙伴不满
    据新华社18日讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋公约组织理事会17日下午会议继续讨论这个侵略性军事集团被称为“盔甲上的裂缝”的问题——各会员国间在军事方面的矛盾。
    据会议透露出来的消息说，北大西洋公约集团军总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德再次发言，驱策其他国家加紧扩充军备。他“强烈地呼吁”各会员国履行它们的“军事义务”，“斥责”一些成员国“曾经允诺的比它们贡献的要多”。诺斯塔德还谈到了建立中程导弹基地的问题，表示希望尽快在西欧国家建立导弹发射装置和原子武器基地。有消息说，诺斯塔德的话是针对没有按照美国计划进行扩军活动的大多数会员国，特别是法国而说的。
    诺斯塔德的发言实际上是重复了美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在当天上午会议上的发言。
    法国陆军部长居约马对美国的压力表现出明显的不满。居约马埋怨说，法国并不是在选择“轻易的道路”，在法国所处的局势中，占支配地位的是阿尔及利亚局势，这个局势是需要作“相当大的努力”的。他还说，在北大西洋公约组织所有成员国当中，从人力来看，法国所作的努力“最大”，它的现役人员有一百万人，服役期限是二十六个半月。法国已经把它的国民总收入的9％花在军事方面，它在北大西洋公约组织中所作的“防务努力”仅次于美国。
    居约马还诉说法国的捐税已经很高，法国政府必须在北大西洋公约组织内和组织外承担的“义务”之间“保持平衡”。
    其他国家的代表一个接着一个发言，对美国策划的“包括各种各样的额外牺牲”的扩军计划表示犹豫。
    消息说，经过讨论，会议就这个军事集团的“最低限度”的军事需要达成协议，草拟了一项关于1959年度的扩军目标的决议，这项决议将在18日上午起草北大西洋公约组织理事会三天会议的最后公报之前再加以讨论。会议谈到了这个军事集团的“最高目的”——武器标准化和武装部队的合并问题，但是没有什么结果。
    在经过短暂的休会后，理事会转入讨论远东、近东和地中海地区等问题。这个军事集团花了两个小时讨论它的成员国在上述地区的侵略政策。杜勒斯在会上作了美国对中国和远东政策的报告。
    18日上午会议通过了一项有关军事问题的决议。这项决议说，在北大西洋集团各国履行它们的军事义务方面还存在着“相当大的缺点”。决议责成北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克尽早到各国首都去同各国政府讨论它们各自在“履行对于北大西洋公约组织的义务方面所面临的困难”，并在定于明年4月在华盛顿召开的理事会会议上提出报告。这个决议本身就说明了：美国鞭策许多西欧国家加紧扩军备战的计划遭到了许多困难。
