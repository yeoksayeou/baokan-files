Not Being a "Hand-Reaching Party" in Construction
    Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee Arranges Next Year's Production in Accordance with the Spirit of Self-Reliance

(Our dispatch from Xi'an, December 10th) The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee recently held an industrial conference, deciding that the raw materials and equipment needed for industrial and agricultural construction in the province next year will mainly be resolved through self-reliance, and that potential will be tapped to support industrial construction in the Northwest region.

The scale of industrial construction in Shaanxi Province in 1959 will be very large. If the province relies on the state to allocate equipment and materials from other places, it will not only be impossible to meet the needs, but transportation will also be difficult. Therefore, the conference focused on studying and solving the problem of self-reliance on the industrial front when arranging production and construction work this winter and next spring.

The conference analyzed the various favorable conditions and difficulties in solving the problem of industrial raw materials and equipment through self-reliance. The conference believes that the mass movement of running industry by the whole people with steel as the key link has achieved great victories, not only changing the situation of Shaanxi Province being "unarmed," but also driving the rapid development of all industrial sectors. These have laid a favorable foundation for large-scale industrial construction through self-reliance next year. At the same time, Shaanxi Province also has abundant reserves of industrial raw materials. Of course, there will be some difficulties in achieving self-reliance next year, such as the weak foundation of the raw material industry, the lack of heavy equipment in the machinery industry, and weak technical strength. However, as long as we exert full effort, break superstitions, and fully mobilize the masses, these difficulties can be overcome.

The conference believes that to solve the problem of self-reliance in industrial construction in Shaanxi Province and ensure the high-speed development of industrial construction, it is necessary to first accelerate the construction of basic industries such as raw materials (mainly the metallurgical industry), machinery, and power. After detailed research, all departments have put forward self-reliance targets and measures. Next year, the iron and steel industry will increase pig iron production, initially equip the small and medium-sized machinery factories of the special districts, counties, and communes, and appropriately increase the degree of agricultural mechanization. Next year, in addition to producing large and precision machine tools, the machinery industry will also produce large-scale metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, and mining machinery that Shaanxi Province has never produced before. The output of the petroleum industry and other industries will increase significantly next year.

To achieve self-reliance, ideological problems must be solved. The conference conducted a serious struggle against the erroneous thinking of the "hand-reaching party" and the "skeptical party." Many people also used facts to illustrate that as long as we break superstitions and mobilize the masses, we can achieve self-reliance. For example, the Dali County Machinery Factory originally only had two small lathes and an eight-horsepower diesel engine; now, they rely on the masses to produce mechanical and power equipment such as lathes, milling machines, planers, and drilling machines using indigenous methods, equipping themselves and equipping seven small factories. The conference believes that in the future, it is necessary to continue to mobilize the masses and thoroughly criticize these incorrect ideas through large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates.

The conference also believes that to complete such arduous tasks, it is necessary to launch a mass movement on the entire industrial front in the province and implement the principle of "small indigenous groups" and "large foreign groups" walking on two legs.

### 建设当中不作“伸手派”  陕西省委按照自力更生精神安排明年生产

    建设当中不作“伸手派”
    陕西省委按照自力更生精神安排明年生产
    本报西安10日电  中共陕西省委最近召开工业会议，决定明年全省工农业建设所需要的原料、设备主要靠自力更生解决，并要挖掘潜力支援西北地区的工业建设。
    1959年陕西省的工业建设规模很大，如果依赖国家从外地调拨设备和材料，不仅不可能满足需要，运输也有困难。因此，会议在安排今冬明春的生产和建设工作中，着重研究解决了工业战线上自力更生的问题。
    会议分析了自力更生解决工业原料和设备问题的各种有利条件和困难。会议认为，以钢为纲全民办工业的群众运动取得了很大的胜利，不仅改变了陕西省“手无寸铁”的局面，而且带动了一切工业部门迅速向前发展。这都为明年自力更生大搞工业建设打下了有利的基础。同时，陕西省的工业原料储藏也很丰富。当然，明年要作到自力更生也有一些困难，如原料工业基础薄弱，机械工业缺乏重型设备，技术力量薄弱等。但是，只要鼓足干劲，破除迷信，充分发动群众，这些困难是可以克服的。
    会议认为，要解决陕西省工业建设自力更生的问题，保证工业建设高速度发展，必须首先加速原材料（主要是冶金工业）、机械、动力等基本工业的建设。各部门经过详细研究以后，都提出了自力更生的指标和措施。钢铁工业明年将增产生铁，把专区、县、社的中小型机械厂初步武装起来，并适当增加农业机械化的程度。机械工业明年除生产大型、精密机床外，还将生产陕西省过去从未生产过的大型冶金设备、发电设备和矿山机械。石油工业等明年的产量都将增长不少。
    要自力更生，必须解决思想问题。会议对“伸手派”“怀疑派”等的错误思想进行了严肃的斗争。很多人还用事实说明，只要破除迷信，发动群众，就能自力更生。如大荔县机械厂原来只有两台小车床、一台八马力的柴油机；现在，他们依靠群众用土法生产出车床、铣床、刨床、钻床等机械、动力设备，武装了自己，并且装备了七个小型工厂。会议认为，今后还必须继续发动群众，用大鸣大放，大辩论的方式，彻底批判这些不正确的思想。
    会议还认为，要完成这样艰巨的任务，必须在全省工业战线上大搞群众运动，贯彻“小土群”和“大洋群”两条腿走路的方针。
