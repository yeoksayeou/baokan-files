    Feeding More Fodder Makes Hogs Grow Faster
    Sichuan Universally Launches Hog Fattening Campaign
    (Our dispatch) Sichuan province is seizing the favorable conditions of communization and a bumper grain harvest, and is launching a hog fattening campaign. The province plans to fatten all seven million of its 80-斤 plus (40kg or 88lbs) feeder pigs into large fat hogs before the Spring Festival, to meet the demands of external transfer and ensure the province's needs during the Spring Festival. Regions that started the campaign earlier have already achieved significant results. In Yibin County, over 40,000 feeder pigs being fattened are now gaining an average of two to four *jin* of meat per day, an increase of seven to ten times compared to the original four to six *liang* per day. In Cangxi County, in just over 20 days, the county has basically eliminated all 54,000-plus Category III pigs (sick, weak pigs), with the majority even being promoted to Category I pigs.
    Sichuan Province's hog development has been rapid this year. According to statistics from the end of September, the province has increased from more than 25 million hogs at the end of last year to more than 37 million hogs. After the rural communization in October, the number of hogs has increased again, and it is expected to reach more than 42 million hogs by the end of the year. While developing a large number of hogs, various regions are also paying attention to accelerating the fattening speed of hogs, and have supplied a large number of fat hogs to both inside and outside the province over the past year. However, according to investigations, the rate at which fat hogs leave the pen still cannot meet the needs. In particular, in some regions, People's Communes, in the previous stage, due to tight production schedules, did not properly arrange labor. After the peasants' private pigs entered the commune, the feeding and management work did not keep up in time, resulting in some hogs not being raised well and the fattening time being prolonged. In order to quickly change this situation, a mass upsurge of feeding pigs well and fattening them has been launched in various regions.
    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to this work. In Nanchong Prefecture, from the county to the commune level, the Party committee secretaries personally took charge, helping the People's Communes to make plans. In Yibin Prefecture, the People's Communes trained a large number of technicians and feeders, and established professional rapid fattening teams, dividing areas and sections to take responsibility. Cadres in charge of hog production at all levels also went deep into the pigsties to establish "experimental fields" for fattening.
    Strengthening feed supply and improving feeding methods are important links in fattening pigs. The People's Communes in various regions have universally sorted out the hogs, and according to different situations such as size and strength, they are fed in separate pens and the feed is allocated in separate troughs. Counties such as Yingshan, Xichong, Cangxi, and Yilong have promoted "Four Fixes" (fixed person, fixed time, fixed pig, fixed condition) and Three Improvements (changing from feeding two meals a day to three or four meals, improving pigsty equipment, and improving feeding tools). At the same time, they also add fine feed and store a large amount of green feed to ensure that every hog eats well and eats its fill. Counties such as Peng County and Anyue County have also set up "nutrition centers" or specialized farms specifically for Category III pigs for careful feeding. In addition, various regions have also vigorously promoted various advanced rapid fattening methods, such as cutting tails and ears, cutting the thyroid gland, and injecting milk needles. After the People's Communes in the suburban areas of Yibin City promoted these advanced methods, the number of fat hogs leaving the pen doubled in one month. (Liu Zongtang) (Attached picture)

    饲料喂得多  毛猪生长快
    四川普遍开展生猪催肥运动
    本报讯  四川省各地抓紧公社化和粮食大丰收的有利条件，正在开展一个催肥猪运动。全省计划春节前要把现有的七百万头八十斤以上的架子猪全部喂成大肥猪，以满足外调任务和保证本省春节需要。运动开展较早的地区，现已收到显著成效。宜宾县催喂的四万多头架子猪，现在每天平均长肉二至四斤，比原来每天长肉四至六两增加了七至十倍。苍溪县在二十多天的时间内，已将全县原有的五万四千多头三类猪（病、弱猪）基本消灭，大多数并且跃升为一类猪。
    四川省今年毛猪发展很快，据9月底统计，全省已由去年年底的二千五百多万头，增加到三千七百多万头，10月份农村公社化后，毛猪数量又有增加，预计年底将发展到四千二百多万头。各地在大量发展毛猪同时，还注意加快毛猪肥育速度，一年来供应了省内外大批肥猪。但是，根据调查，发现肥猪出槽速度仍然不能适应需要，特别是部分地区人民公社前一阶段时间由于生产紧张，没有妥善安排劳力，社员私猪入社后，饲养管理工作没有及时跟上，以致有些毛猪养得不好，肥猪出槽时间拖长。为了迅速改变这种情况。各地普遍掀起了群众性的把猪喂肥喂好的热潮。
    各级党委非常重视这项工作。南充专区各县，从县到公社，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，帮助各人民公社作出规划。宜宾专区人民公社训练了大批技术员、饲养员，建立了专业化的快速育肥队伍，分片包干、划段负责。各级专管毛猪生产的干部，还深入猪圈建立催肥的“试验田”。
    加强饲料供应，改进饲养方法是催肥猪的重要一环。各地人民公社普遍进行了毛猪排队，根据大小、强弱等不同情况，分圈饲养，分槽配料。营山、西充、苍溪、仪陇等县推行了“四定”（定人、定时、定猪、定膘）和三改（改每天喂两顿为三顿或四顿、改善猪圈设备、改良饲养工具），同时还加喂精料，大量贮备青饲料，保证个个毛猪吃好、吃饱。彭县、安岳等县还专门为三类猪设立了“营养院”或专业场，细养精喂。另外，各地还大力推广各种先进的快速育肥法，如割尾巴、耳朵、割甲状线，打牛奶针等。宜宾市郊区人民公社推广了这些先进办法后，肥猪出槽数在一个月内增加了一倍。  （刘宗棠）（附图片）
