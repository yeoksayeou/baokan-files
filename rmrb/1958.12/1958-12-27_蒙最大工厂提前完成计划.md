Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 25th: The Mongolian Industrial United Factory, one of the largest and oldest factories in the Mongolian People's Republic, completed its production plan for this year ahead of schedule on the 23rd and overfulfilled its savings plan.

    Recently, this agency's reporter visited the factory director, Gambuzhabu. He introduced the factory's situation to the reporter, saying: The United Factory was established in 1934, and next March will be its 25th anniversary. The factory now has six branch factories, including shoe-making and felt-making. The main reason for the good completion of this year's production tasks is that 95% of the factory's 2,500 employees participated in the socialist production competition. At the same time, the factory's Party organization, in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, conducted propaganda and education for the workers, thereby improving their production enthusiasm. In addition, the factory management was improved, and experience was regularly checked and summarized.

    The director also said that the United Factory is now building and expanding new factory buildings, including a woolen textile factory aided by China and a new shoe factory built with the help of Czechoslovakia. The factory buildings of these two factories have been basically completed and will be put into production next year and the year after, respectively. After the new construction and expansion projects are completed, the factory will produce products worth 100 million tugriks (Mongolian currency) annually, which will increase the existing production level by two to three times, and the number of workers will also increase to four to five thousand. At present, the workers are actively working and producing to welcome the 25th anniversary of the factory's establishment.

    蒙最大工厂提前完成计划
    新华社乌兰巴托25日电  蒙古人民共和国最大和历史最长的工厂之一、蒙古工业联合工厂已在23日提前完成今年的生产计划，并且超额完成了节约计划。
    前不久，本社记者访问了这个工厂的厂长冈布扎布。他向记者介绍这个工厂的情况说：联合工厂创建于1934年，明年3月，就是它建厂二十五周年。这个工厂现在拥有制鞋和制毡等六个分厂。今年生产任务完成得好的主要原因是全厂的两千五百多名职工有95％的人都参加了社会主义生产竞赛。同时，工厂党组织根据蒙古人民革命党十三次代表大会决议的精神，向工人们进行了宣传教育，从而提高了他们的生产积极性。此外，还改进了工厂管理，经常进行检查和总结经验。
    厂长还说，联合工厂现在正在新建和扩建新的厂房，其中包括中国援助的毛纺织厂、捷克斯洛伐克帮助建设的一个新皮鞋工厂。这两个工厂的厂房已基本完工，并将分别在明年和后年投入生产。新建和扩建工程完成后，工厂每年将生产价值一亿图格里克（蒙币名）的产品，比现有的生产水平提高到二至三倍，工人也将增加到四、五千人。目前，工人们正在为迎接建厂二十五周年而积极劳动生产。
