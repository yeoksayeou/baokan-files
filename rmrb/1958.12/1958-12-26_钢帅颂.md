Collected are verses on steelmaking from travels in various places over the past year, to celebrate the victory of 10.7 million tons.

	Soaring furnace tops reach the sky,
	Iron ingots like oak troughs on mountains lie.
	From pouring mouths, fiery waterfalls cascade,
	Under rolling mills, silver dragons parade.
	(Seen at Anshan Iron and Steel)

	Smoke and dust rival battlefields,
	Bulldozers reclaim land, building Wuhan Steel.
	Pointing to the day green hills meet Huangshi,
	Joyfully watching red flames reflect blue light.
	(First visit to the Wuhan Steel construction site)

	Breaking through the first hurdle of furnace opening,
	For a moment, the three towns are all smiles.
	Steel flowers and molten iron flow into the Yangtze and Han Rivers,
	From now on, the Central Plains will be extraordinary!
	(Joy of Wuhan Steel's first furnace)

	Not many days since leaving Xushui,
	The leap forward is truly like decades.
	Thousands of evening rays convey crimson flames,
	Ten miles of flat forest walk in grey smoke.
	(Passing through Xushui again)

	Heads covered with floral scarves, wearing floral cloth,
	Deep plowing and meticulous work, side by side, are vigorous.
	Don't be surprised that there are few men in the countryside,
	Making steel now goes to Quyang.
	(Seen in Anguo)

	Excelling in both studying and production,
	No longer with pale faces lingering by the school window.
	China has many new role models,
	Chopin emerges beside the steelmaking furnace.
	(The National Conservatory of Music making steel in Tianjin does not affect learning.)

	Blast furnaces are everywhere, becoming forests and bamboo groves,
	Fierce fire burns the sky, breaking the azure.
	All the way singing the praises of the commune,
	Don't look at Jiangnan through the lens of extravagance.
	(Night view passing through Jiangsu and Zhejiang)

	The Futun River is already charming,
	Even more delighted the Min River is as green as fine wine.
	Don't regret the lack of moonlight on the night voyage,
	The light of the steelmaking furnace enters the blue sky.
	(Both banks of the Min River)

	All treat the furnace side as home,
	Mountain villages dance steel flowers every night.
	Why worry about hunger and thirst from the crucible?
	The whole commune washes iron sand by the riverhead.
	(Seen in Jinjiang)

	Riding a bike, pedaling flies,
	Furnace fire burns fiercely, sweat soaks clothes.
	Several times urged to return, but none go,
	Only because one's body is a blower.
	(Fuzhou cultural system makes steel, using bicycle wheels for blower power)

	Branches and trunks are oblique, leaves half yellow,
	Zhangzhou furnace flames face the setting sun.
	Why be stingy about acacia trees for steelmaking?
	An inch of acacia, an inch of steel.
	(A Zhangzhou iron smelting furnace felling acacia trees for fuel)

	How many times have we gone to He厝 beach,
	Broken skins and scattered shells suddenly become piles.
	Although Xiamen has no raw materials for ironmaking,
	Kinmen sends it over.
	(Soldiers and militiamen on the coast of Xiamen collect enemy shell casings for furnace raw materials)

	Snowflakes flutter in Zongbu Hutong,
	Blowing air and adding fire, enthusiasm is even greater.
	Steelmaking and pen-making require high heat,
	First be a worker, then a writer.
	(Capital writers make steel)

    钢帅颂
    田汉
    试把年来在各地旅行中关于炼钢得句集成一组，来祝贺1070万吨的胜利。嵯峨炉顶接天高，铁锭如山上橡槽。倾泻口中飞火瀑，压延机下走银蛟。
          （鞍钢所见）硝烟尘雾赛沙场，推土开荒建武钢。指日青山接黄石，喜看红焰映蓝光。
    （首次参观武钢工地）突破开炉第一关，一时三镇尽开颜。钢花铁水流江汉，从此中原不一般！
      （武钢第一炉之喜）才离徐水不多天，飞跃真如数十年。夕照千条输赤焰，平林十里走苍烟。
          （重过徐水）花帕蒙头花布裳，深翻细作并轩昂。农村莫怪男人少，炼铁如今上曲阳。
          （安国所见）读书生产两无双，不再苍颜恋学窗。中国正多新榜样，炼钢炉畔出萧邦。
    （国立音乐院在天津炼钢，并不影响学习。）高炉遍地成林箐，猛火烧天破蔚蓝。一路尽歌公社好，莫从金粉看江南。
        （过江浙夜景）富屯溪水已多娇，更喜闽江碧似醪。莫憾夜航差月色，炼钢炉火入青霄。
          （闽江两岸）都把炉边当住家，山村夜夜舞钢花。坩埚何必愁饥渴？全社江头洗铁沙。
            （晋江所见）骑车踏蹬转如飞，炉火熊熊汗染衣。几度催归都不去，只缘身是鼓风机。
  （福州文化系统炼钢，利用自行车轮做鼓风动力）枝干横斜叶半黄，漳州炉焰对斜阳。炼钢何惜相思树，一寸相思一寸钢。
      （漳州一炼铁炉伐相思树做燃料）何厝滩头去几回，碎皮零壳忽成堆。厦门炼铁虽无料，自有金门送得来。
  （厦门海边战士民兵拾敌人弹壳供炼炉原料）总布胡同飘雪花，鼓风加火兴弥奢。炼钢炼笔需高热，先作工人后作家。
        （首都作家炼钢）
