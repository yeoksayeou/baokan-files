Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a standing committee meeting on the 21st, attended by the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal committees, to study the current production and supply of non-staple foods in urban and rural areas.

Yang Shangkun, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, pointed out at the meeting that doing a good job in the production and supply of non-staple foods is an important economic task and also an important political task. It is related to the lives of urban and rural people, the income of commune members, and next year's production. Party committees at all levels must take the lead and conscientiously grasp this work. Yang Shangkun said that the Spring Festival is approaching, and the masses have worked hard for a year, achieving great results in industrial and agricultural production. Party committees at all levels must immediately take action to ensure that urban and rural people have a good Spring Festival by every possible means. The requirements for a good Spring Festival are: eat well, have fun, and rest well, so that the masses are happy and lively, in order to muster greater efforts to strive for greater leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production next year. He said: Ensuring that the masses have a good Spring Festival is the most urgent matter for the Party to care about in the lives of the masses.

The meeting held that to improve the supply of non-staple foods, it is necessary to first arrange the production of non-staple foods and comprehensively arrange the labor force. The meeting redeployed the province's water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation tasks, deciding to allocate 20% of the province's six million laborers, i.e., 1.2 million people, to immediately engage in various sideline productions. From now until the end of January, a blitz campaign will be launched throughout the province to vigorously engage in sideline productions such as pig raising, chicken and duck raising, vegetable growing, firewood cutting, charcoal burning, fishing, and processing and transportation. Through this blitz campaign, the supply of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, and firewood for the daily life of urban and rural people, especially during the two festivals (New Year's Day and Spring Festival), will be guaranteed. The meeting pointed out that materials commonly used by urban and rural people during the Spring Festival, such as glutinous rice, peanuts, sesame, soybeans, and rice flour, must be guaranteed, and the quantity should be increased compared to last year.

The meeting also pointed out that in order to have a good Spring Festival, it is very necessary to find ways to increase the cash income of farmers before and after the Spring Festival. The meeting requested that in the more than one month from now until the end of January, use blitz sideline production and other methods to increase the cash income of each commune member by ten to fifteen yuan. The meeting also made specific arrangements for the purchase of non-staple foods and the transfer of grain and non-staple foods.

The meeting particularly emphasized that rural areas should have a good New Year, cities should also have a good New Year, the province should have a good New Year, and it is also necessary to support large cities to have a good New Year. To this end, the meeting decided to transfer a large number of non-staple foods such as pigs, fish, eggs, and bamboo shoots to support large cities such as Shanghai and Beijing and the Fujian front line, and support the local military and civilians to have a good Spring Festival.

That evening, the Provincial Party Committee held another telephone conference to convey the decision of the Provincial Standing Committee meeting to party committees at all levels, requiring all localities to take immediate action, make good arrangements for the labor force, and comprehensively grasp sideline production while doing a good job in water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and field management of crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a telephone conference on the evening of the 19th to deploy the current supply of grain and non-staple foods to urban and rural people and winter production work, determining that the first secretaries of local, municipal, and county party committees should personally take the lead and grasp all work related to the current lives of urban and rural people, just like grasping the steel industry in the previous period.

Prior to the telephone conference, the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee held an enlarged meeting to study the current living and production conditions of urban and rural people throughout the province, and decided that party committees at all levels from the province to the county should have their first secretaries take the lead in improving the supply of grain and non-staple foods needed by urban and rural people within one month to ensure that people happily celebrate the New Year and Spring Festival. The meeting determined that Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, would take the lead at the provincial level, and Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor, and Xie Xuegong, Secretary of the Secretariat, would jointly lead this work. The meeting also put forward some specific measures, which were deployed at the telephone conference on the evening of the 19th. The Provincial Party Committee requested all localities to further clarify the bottom line of grain, quickly transfer what should be transferred, and pay attention to saving and preventing waste while ensuring that people eat as well as possible. Sufficient preparations should also be made for firewood needed by people to survive the winter and forage needed by livestock. In terms of non-staple food supply, existing vegetables should be properly stored, vegetables needed by medium and large cities should be transferred in a timely manner, a large amount of pickles should be pickled, bean sprouts and tofu should be produced, and sweet potatoes should be processed into vermicelli and starch sheets. The transfer of live pigs for the supply of medium and large cities should be guaranteed. All localities should adopt existing rapid fattening methods to fatten live pigs. Effective measures should also be taken to promote the development of the production of chickens, ducks, and other poultry and fish. Oil crops should be processed quickly, and some labor can currently be drawn from the steel and water conservancy fronts to transfer to oil extraction and other winter production.

The Provincial Party Committee also put forward some opinions on the development of sideline production, requiring all localities to implement them.
Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 22nd: Party and government leaders at all levels in Fujian Province are using the same energy as they did in vigorously developing steel production to vigorously grasp the production and supply of non-staple foods, so that the frontline troops and the people of the entire province can have a good New Year and Spring Festival. After the Ministry of Finance and Trade of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a telephone conference on the 17th, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately had Comrade Ye Fei, First Secretary, personally take the lead in grasping the production and supply of non-staple foods. On the 19th, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held another telephone conference of prefectural and county party committee secretaries, requiring all localities to vigorously grasp the production of sideline industries and non-staple foods, while launching a major purchasing campaign, so that communes and commune members have cash, the market has materials, and ensure that the frontline troops and the people of the entire province have a lively and happy New Year and Spring Festival.

In order to effectively improve sideline production, especially non-staple food production, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee emphasized that while developing grain production, it is also necessary to develop diversified economies. At present, the winter production tasks such as deep plowing, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation are very heavy, and it is necessary to carefully arrange the labor force, organize specialized teams for sideline production, and stipulate production tasks. Under the condition of not hindering collective labor, commune members' families can also raise small livestock and poultry and engage in small sideline businesses. When distributing, each commune can allocate a portion of grain and fine bran to commune members according to the situation of the commune and help commune members open up feed sources to solve the feed problems of small livestock and poultry.

On the 19th, the Fujian Provincial Logistics Headquarters also issued a notice to logistics headquarters at all levels, requiring them to concentrate transportation forces in late December to launch a blitz transportation battle for grain and non-staple foods, and transport non-staple foods to the coastal defense front and urban and industrial areas.

    第一书记挂帅抓副食品
    多生产多收购快运输  让城乡人民过个欢乐年
    本报南昌22日电  中共江西省委21日召开了有地、市委第一书记参加的常委会议，研究当前城乡副食品的生产和供应问题。
    省委第一书记杨尚奎在会上指出，做好当前副食品的生产和供应工作，是一项重要的经济工作，也是一项重要的政治任务。它关系到城乡人民生活、社员收入和明年的生产，各级党委必须由第一书记挂帅，切实把这一工作抓起来。杨尚奎说，现在春节将到，群众苦战了一年，工农业生产取得了很大的成绩，各级党委必须立即动手，千方百计地保证城乡人民过好春节。过好春节的要求是：吃好，玩好，休息好，使群众高高兴兴，热热闹闹，以便鼓足更大的干劲，争取明年工农业生产更大的跃进。他说：保证群众过好春节，是当前党关心群众生活中最紧要的事情。
    会议认为，要搞好副食品供应工作，必须首先安排好副食品的生产，必须全面安排劳动力。会议重新部署了全省的水利和积肥任务，决定在全省六百万个劳动力中抽调20％，即一百二十万人，立即投入各种副业生产。从现在开始到1月底，在全省范围内开展一个大搞养猪、养鸡鸭、种菜、砍柴、烧炭、打鱼、加工运输等副业生产的突击运动。通过这个突击运动，保证城乡人民平日、尤其是两个节日（元旦和春节）的肉类、鱼类、蛋类、菜类和柴炭的供应。会议指出，城乡人民在过春节时习惯用的物资，如糯米、花生、芝麻、大豆、米粉等，必须保证供应，而且数量要比去年有所增加。
    会议还指出，为了过好春节，在春节前后设法使农民多增加一些现金收入非常必要。会议要求在从目前到1月底的一个多月中，用突击副业生产等各项办法，使公社社员每人增加十元到十五元的现金收入。会议对副食品的收购，粮食和副食品的调运，也做了具体部署。
    会议特别强调：农村要过好年，城市也要过好年，本省要过好年，也要支援大城市过好年。为此，会议确定调运大批猪、鱼、蛋、冬笋等副食品支援上海、北京等大城市及福建前线，支援当地军民过好春节。
    当天晚上，省委又召开电话会议，向各级党委传达了省常委会议的决定。要求各地立即行动起来，很好地安排劳动力，在搞好水利、积肥和农作物田间管理的同时，全面地把副业生产抓起来。（李久泽）
    新华社天津21日电  中共河北省委在19日晚上召开电话会议部署当前城乡人民粮食、副食品供应和冬季生产工作，确定各地、市、县委第一书记要亲自挂帅，像前一段抓钢铁工业一样，抓好当前城乡人民生活有关的各项工作。
    在电话会议以前，河北省委书记处曾举行扩大会议，研究了全省当前城乡人民生活和生产情况，决定从省到县各级党委要第一书记亲自动手，在一个月内搞好城乡人民所需粮食和副食品的供应工作，保证人民欢欢喜喜过好新年和春节。会议确定省级由省委第一书记林铁挂帅，省委书记、省长刘子厚和书记处书记解学恭共同领导这一工作。会议并提出了一些具体措施，在19日晚上的电话会议上作了部署。省委要求各地进一步摸清粮食的底码，该调运的迅速调运，并在使人民尽量吃好的情况下，注意节约、防止浪费。对人民过冬需要的柴草和牲畜需要的饲草，也要作充分准备。在副食品供应上，现有的蔬菜要保管好，对中等以上城市需要的蔬菜要及时调运，要大量腌制咸菜，生产豆芽豆腐，把红薯加工成粉条、粉皮。供应中等以上城市的生猪要保证调运。各地要采取已有的快速育肥法，育肥生猪。鸡、鸭等各种家禽和鱼类生产，也要采取有效措施促使发展。油料作物要迅速加工，目前可以从钢铁和水利战线上抽出一部分劳动力转到榨油和其他冬季生产上来。
    对于副业生产的发展，省委也提出了几点意见，要求各地贯彻。
    据新华社福州22日电  福建省各级党政领导以大搞钢铁生产的劲头，大抓副食品生产和供应工作，使前线部队和全省人民过好新年和春节。17日中共中央财贸部召开电话会议以后，中共福建省委即由第一书记叶飞同志亲自挂帅，抓副食品生产和供应工作。19日中共福建省委又召开地委、县委书记电话会议，要求各地大抓一下副业和副食品的生产，同时开展大收大购运动，使公社和社员有现钱，市场有物资，保证前线部队和全省人民热热闹闹、快快乐乐地过好新年和春节。
    为切实把副业生产特别是副食品生产搞好，福建省委强调在发展粮食生产的同时要发展多种经济。目前深翻地、修水利、积肥等冬季生产任务很繁重，必须认真安排劳动力，组织搞副业生产的专业队，规定生产任务。在不妨碍集体劳动的条件下，社员家庭也可以饲养小家畜、家禽，搞小副业，各公社在分配时，可按本社情况，分配一部分粮食和细糠给社员，并帮助社员开辟饲料来源，解决小家畜、家禽的饲料问题。
    19日，福建省后勤指挥部也向各级后勤指挥部发出通知，要求在12月下旬集中运输力量，开展一个粮食和副食品的突击运输战，把副食品运到海防前线和城市、工矿区。
