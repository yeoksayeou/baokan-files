Lüda, December 10th (This newspaper dispatch) – While striving to fulfill their leap forward plans for this year ahead of schedule, over a hundred factories and enterprises in Lüda City have launched a mass movement focused on self-manufacturing and conserving metal materials to overcome barriers in materials, electricity, equipment, and transportation. This is to tap into the potential of enterprises from multiple angles and prepare early for a greater leap forward in industrial production next year.

The mass movement in Lüda City's factories and enterprises to overcome the material barrier is being conducted under the direct leadership of the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. As early as November, after analyzing the current situation of severe metal material shortages, the Municipal Committee pointed out that the difficulty hindering a greater leap forward in production next year was the issue of complete sets of equipment. They immediately called on all factories and enterprises in the city to not rely on or wait for external assistance, but to be self-reliant and arm themselves to overcome the five major difficulties of materials, equipment, electricity, transportation, and labor. The call was to ensure complete production by equipping all sets. This call from the Municipal Committee quickly turned into action by the broad masses of workers throughout the city. In a very short period, a mass movement of "everyone participating, everyone taking action, and overcoming the raw material barrier" was launched throughout the city, and significant results were achieved.

In this mass movement to overcome the material barrier, factories and enterprises in Lüda City all emphasized self-reliance, regarding the production of their own metal materials and auxiliary materials as an important measure to meet the greater production tasks of next year. Currently, many factories throughout the city, without requiring investment, equipment, or materials, have built many small, indigenous, and combined indigenous and foreign satellite factories. They are preparing and are in the process of producing various products such as iron and steel, small steel products, seamless steel pipes, coke, cement, ferrosilicon, plastics, and calcium carbide, striving towards the goal of self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency in raw materials.

The workers of the Dalian Shipyard put forward the slogan "Lack what, make what," determined not to be "reach out" dependents. They plan to set up more than twenty satellite factories this winter and next year, including a blast furnace with an annual output of 40,000 tons of pig iron, a seamless steel pipe plant with an annual output of 5,000 tons, a small rolling mill with an annual output of more than 3,000 tons of angle steel, as well as coking, cement, and welding rod factories. Currently, two square furnaces they have built have already been put into production. The 33 satellite factories set up by the Dalian Dye Factory have already produced 89 kinds of products, of which 12 kinds of raw materials produced can meet the needs of the factory. The Dalian Chemical Plant has also broken through the limitations of specialized production and is moving towards becoming a comprehensive factory. In addition to continuing to produce basic chemical products such as acids, alkalis, and agricultural fertilizers, the plant is also building factories to produce steel, machinery, refractory bricks, and cement. At the same time, the machinery workshop has been expanded into a machinery factory to manufacture some of the machine tools needed by the factory. The factory also uses the waste slag (iron oxide ore) left over from the production of sulfuric acid to refine iron, and then uses this iron to make steel, rolling steel plates, seamless steel pipes, silicon steel sheets, and various small steel products. Currently, a small blast furnace with a volume of 13 cubic meters has been put into production.

Many large machinery manufacturing plants in Lüda City also regard vigorously revising product designs, simplifying product structures, and improving process regulations as important ways to save a large amount of materials and processing man-hours. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory recently used the method of combining workers, technicians, and leading cadres to revise the design of the "Peace" locomotive. As a result, the weight of the new locomotive was reduced by 48 tons compared with the original "Peace" locomotive, saving 27% of materials and 30% of processing man-hours, while the performance of the locomotive was even better than before. The locomotive's traction capacity was increased by 10%, and the driving speed per hour was increased by 10 kilometers. As a result of the design modification, the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory reduced the weight of the slag car from 67 tons to 33 tons, and the materials used to manufacture one slag car in the past can now be used to manufacture two. The practices of these factories prove that vigorously revising unreasonable product designs is not only an effective method for saving metal materials, but also greatly improves the production technology level of workers due to the participation of the broad masses of workers in the design modification activities.

    抓成套生产  搞群众运动
    旅大一百多个工厂大破材料、设备、电力关
    本报旅大10日电  旅大市一百多个工厂企业，在力争提前实现今年跃进计划的同时，掀起了一个以自制和节约金属材料为主大破材料、电力、设备和交通运输关的群众运动，从多方面挖掘企业潜力，提早为明年工业生产大跃进作好准备。旅大市工厂企业大破材料关的群众运动，是在中共旅大市委的直接领导下进行的。早在11月间，市委分析了当前金属材料严重不足的形势后，指出了障碍明年生产更大跃进的困难是设备成套问题，当即号召全市工厂企业，不要依赖，不要等待，自力更生，依靠自己武装自己，攻破材料、设备、电力、交通运输和劳动力等五大难关。号召成套生产把套配齐。市委的这一号召，很快就变成了全市广大职工的行动。在很短时间内，全市掀起了一个“人人参加，个个动手，攻破原材料关”的群众运动，并且收到了显著的成效。旅大市的工厂企业，在这次大破材料关的群众运动中，都很强调自力更生，把自己生产金属材料和辅助材料，作为迎接明年更大生产任务的重要措施之一。现在，全市已有不少工厂，不要投资、设备和材料，建设起许多小的、土的和土洋结合的卫星工厂，准备和正在生产钢铁、小型钢材、无缝钢管、焦炭、水泥、矽铁、塑料和电石等多种产品，向着原材料的自给和半自给的目标奋斗。大连造船厂的职工，提出“缺什么，造什么”的口号，决心不当伸手派，计划在今冬和明年内，办起二十多个卫星工厂，其中包括年产四万吨生铁的高炉、年产五千吨的无缝钢管厂、年产三千多吨角钢的小型轧钢厂以及炼焦、水泥、焊条等工厂，现在，他们建设的两座方型炉已经投入生产。大连染料厂办起的三十三个卫星工厂，已经生产了八十九种产品，其中生产的十二种原材料，已能满足本厂的需要。大连化工厂也突破了生产专业化的限制，正在向着综合性工厂方向发展。这个厂除了继续生产酸、碱和农肥等基本化学产品以外，还正在建设一些生产钢铁、机械、耐火砖和水泥的工厂。同时还把机械车间扩建成机械工厂，制造本厂需要的一些工作母机。这个工厂还利用制造硫酸时剩余下来的废炉渣（氧化铁矿石）炼铁，然后再用这些铁自己炼钢轧制钢板、无缝钢管、矽钢片和各种小型钢材。现在，一座十三立方公尺的小高炉已经投入生产。旅大市许多大型的机械制造厂，还把大力修改产品设计、简化产品结构以及改进工艺规程，当作大量节约材料和节约加工工时的重要途径。大连机车车辆工厂最近运用工人、技术人员和领导干部三结合的方法，修改了“和平型”机车的设计，结果使新机车的自重比原“和平”型机车减轻了四十八吨，节省材料27％，加工工时节省了30％，而机车的性能比过去更好了，机车牵引能力比过去提高了10％，每小时的行车速度增加了十公里。修改设计的结果，大连工矿车辆厂使矿渣车的自重由六十七吨减轻到三十三吨，用过去制造一台矿渣车的材料，可以制造出两台来。这些工厂的作法证明，大力修改不合理的产品设计，不仅是节约金属材料的有效方法，而且由于吸收了广大职工参加修改设计的活动，职工的生产技术水平大大提高了。（附图片）
