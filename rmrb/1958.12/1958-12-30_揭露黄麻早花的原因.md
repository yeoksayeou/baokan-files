Scientific Developments

    The Biology Department of Zhongshan University believes, based on experimental results, that shorter daylight hours are the main cause of early flowering in jute. Early flowering of jute can lead to a decrease in the yield of jute fiber. Therefore, revealing the causes of early flowering in jute and proposing measures to prevent it are urgent problems to be solved in current production practices.

    This experiment selected three varieties of jute for photoperiod analysis. In the developmental process of the photoperiod, each variety has its own critical day length. When the plant is exposed to daylight longer than the critical day length, the flowering period is significantly delayed; conversely, early flowering occurs, and there is no significant difference in their early flowering phenomena. Therefore, to avoid early flowering of jute, the sowing period must be selected according to different latitudes so that the photoperiod stage of the jute is longer than the critical length of the variety.

    Temperature also affects the flowering period of jute. As the temperature rises, the flowering period advances. In the case where the length of natural daylight changes with the season, although the temperature rises, the flowering period is prolonged due to the extension of daylight hours.

    揭露黄麻早花的原因
    中山大学生物系根据试验结果认为，日照较短是引起黄麻早花的主要原因。黄麻早花能引起麻皮的产量减少。因此，揭露黄麻早花的原因以及提出防止黄麻早花的措施是目前生产实践中急待解决的问题。
    这个试验选用了三个黄麻品种进行光照阶段分析。在光照阶段的发育过程中，各个品种具有自己的临界光照长度，当植株处在比临界光照长度较长的光照下，开花期便显著地延迟；反之则早花，它们的早花现象无显著的差异。因此，要避免黄麻早花则必须根据纬度不同而选择播种期，使黄麻的光照阶段期间处在长于该品种的临界长度。
    温度对黄麻开花期也有影响。随着气温的升高而开花期也就提早。在自然日照的长度随着季节而变化的情况下，虽然温度上升，但是由于日照的延长致使开花期也随之延长。
