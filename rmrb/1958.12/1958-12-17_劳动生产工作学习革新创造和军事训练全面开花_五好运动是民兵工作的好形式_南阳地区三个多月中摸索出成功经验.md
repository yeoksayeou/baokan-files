Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 16th: Since the launch of the "Five Goods" movement in August this year, the militia in the Nanyang region of Henan Province have achieved remarkable results in labor production, work study, innovation and creation, and military training. The Nanyang Military Subdistrict of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently held a field meeting on militia work in Houji Township, Zhenping County, and believes that carrying out the "Five Goods" movement among the militia is a good form of conducting militia political work, giving the broad masses of militiamen a clear and specific goal to strive for.

The "Five Goods" include: good at labor production, good at learning and work, good at setting an example, good at preparedness (national defense) awareness, and good at innovation. In the past three months, under the unified leadership and arrangements of local party committees at all levels, many "Five Goods" units and "Five Goods" pacesetters have emerged. In the first evaluation, some militia regiments had 75% of their members rated as "Five Goods" militiamen.

These "Five Goods" units and militiamen have become models for the masses in industrial and agricultural production. The "Five Goods" movement has taken root in the hearts of the people. The militia of Waizi Township, Xinye County, proposed a plan to ensure a bumper wheat harvest next year in the "Five Goods" movement, taking the lead in deep plowing more than 95,000 mu of land, planting more than 150 mu of high-yield fields, and achieving "six irrigations and six fertilizations." To prevent drought, they also built a river dam with more than 25,000 cubic meters of earthwork, which was unanimously praised by the masses.

The "Five Goods" movement has enabled many militiamen to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and establish a communist style of daring to think, dare to act, dare to speak, and dare to do. Since the launch of the "Five Goods" movement, the militia of Houji Township, Zhenping County, have invented, created, and improved more than 4,400 tools. Veteran Ma Zhankui, determined to be a "Five Goods" pacesetter, studied for twenty-five days and successfully trial-produced a machine tool, saving more than 1,700 yuan in expenses.

The development of the "Five Goods" movement has greatly improved the political consciousness of the militia and greatly strengthened cooperation between people and between teams. The militia said that all work is for the construction of socialism, and they will go wherever they are needed. In military training, the enthusiasm of the militia for learning is even higher, and "all-red townships" and all-excellent units have emerged in various counties in the region.

The "Five Goods" movement must be closely integrated with the central work so that it is "in sync." Some militia regiments focused on good production and labor in the "Five Goods" during deep plowing and large-scale steelmaking; when carrying out cultural revolution and technological revolution, they focused on invention, creation, and work study, making the content of the "Five Goods" rich and colorful with a prominent focus. In the evaluation, full democracy is promoted, and it can also be used as a method of mass self-education. Therefore, it is supported by the militia, and everyone praises it. Cadres say, "The Five Goods are a treasure, and all work cannot be separated from them." The militia said, "The Five Goods are a mirror, illuminating the mind, and from now on, we must be determined to wear the Five Goods flower."

    劳动生产工作学习革新创造和军事训练全面开花
    五好运动是民兵工作的好形式
    南阳地区三个多月中摸索出成功经验
    新华社郑州16日电  河南省南阳地区民兵，从今年8月开展“五好”运动以来，劳动生产、工作学习、革新创造和军事训练等各方面都取得了显著成绩。中国人民解放军南阳军分区最近在镇平县侯集乡召开的民兵工作现场会议上认为，在民兵中开展“五好”运动，是进行民兵政治工作的一个良好形式，使广大民兵的冲天干劲有了明确而具体的奋斗目标。
    “五好”内容是：劳动生产好，学习工作好，模范作用好，战备（国防）观念好，创造革新好。三个多月来，他们在各级地方党委统一领导和安排下，出现了不少的“五好”单位和“五好”标兵，有的民兵团在第一次评比中就有75％的人被评为“五好”民兵。
    这些“五好”单位和民兵，在工农业生产中都成了群众的榜样。“五好”运动深入人心。新野县歪子乡民兵在“五好”运动中提出保证明年小麦大丰收的计划，带头深翻地九万五千多亩，种丰产田一百五十多亩，作到“六水六肥”。为防止干旱，他们还修了一座两万五千多土方的拦河坝，受到群众的一致赞扬。
    “五好”运动使许多民兵破除了迷信，解放了思想，树立了敢想、敢干、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。镇平县侯集乡民兵从开展“五好”运动以来，发明创造和改良各种工具四千四百多件。复员军人马占奎，决心做“五好”标兵，钻研了二十五天，试制成功机床一部，节省了一千七百多元的支出。
    开展“五好”运动，使民兵的政治觉悟大为提高，人与人、队与队的协作大大加强。民兵说，什么工作都是为了建设社会主义，只要需要，叫到哪里就到哪里。在军事训练中，民兵的学习热情更为高涨，这个地区的各个县都出现了“满堂红乡”和全优单位。
    “五好”运动必须和中心工作紧密结合，使它“一个拍子一个调”。有些民兵团在深翻土地和大办钢铁时，把“五好”中的生产劳动好作重点；开展文化革命和技术革命时，又以发明创造和工作学习为重点，使得“五好”内容丰富多彩，中心突出。在评比时充分发扬民主，又可把它作为群众自我教育的一种方法。因此，受到民兵拥护，人人夸好。干部说，“五好是个宝，一切工作离不了。”民兵说，“五好是面镜，照得心发明，从今要把决心下，立志戴上五好花。”
