Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th - "Neues Deutschland" published on the 6th a statement by the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, calling on West Berlin residents to elect candidates from the Socialist Unity Party in the West Berlin City Council elections to be held on December 7th.

The statement said that anyone who opposes war propaganda, opposes the rule of the occupiers, and supports peace, security, and happiness should choose the path pointed out by the German Socialist Unity Party and vote for the candidates put forward by the German Socialist Unity Party.

The statement said: Under the occupation system, West Berlin residents cannot have the guarantee of peaceful labor, security, and happiness. The occupation system has become a threat to the security of the people of West Berlin, the whole of Germany, and all of Europe. The statement said that anyone who hopes for safety for himself and his family should not vote for Adenauer and West Berlin Mayor Brandt, because they advocate maintaining the occupation system forever, advocate the continued activities of spy organizations in West Berlin, and advocate war preparations.

The statement also said that West German Chancellor Adenauer's speech at a rally in West Berlin once again proved that he is an enemy of a peaceful solution to the German question, easing tensions, and disarmament.

The statement pointed out that it is necessary to agree to implement the recommendations put forward by the Soviet government in its note on the Berlin issue. This will ease tensions throughout Germany and Europe, and will be the first stage in negotiations to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

Grotewohl emphasized in the statement that, with the status of a free city, West Berlin's economy will be freed from its one-sided dependence. The unemployment that has plagued West Berlin for the past ten years can be completely eliminated.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th - Chairman of the Democratic Women's League of Germany, I. Thiele, said, "The Western occupiers have turned West Berlin into a quagmire that threatens world peace, incites, degrades, and is immoral, and the Soviet government's proposals strongly represent the interests of German women." This is what she said in a letter to Soviet women today.

The letter also said that the women of the German Democratic Republic welcome with gratitude the Soviet government's proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

The letter concluded by stating that German women pledge to work harder to strengthen ties with Soviet women and jointly oppose atomic war mongers.

    格罗提渥发表声明指出
    西柏林占领制度威胁欧洲安全
    号召西柏林居民在市议会选举中选统一社会党候选人
    新华社柏林6日电  “新德意志报”6日刊载民主德国总理格罗提渥的一篇声明，号召西柏林居民在12月7日举行的西柏林市议会选举中选举统一社会党的候选人。
    这篇声明说，谁要是反对战争宣传，反对占领者的统治，谁要是拥护和平、安全和幸福，他就应当选择德国统一社会党所指出的道路，并且投票选举德国统一社会党提出的候选人。
    声明说：在占领制度下，西柏林居民不可能有和平劳动、安全和幸福的保障。占领制度已经成为西柏林、整个德国和全欧洲人民安全的威胁。声明说，谁要是希望自己和家庭安全，他就不应当投票选举阿登纳和西柏林市长勃兰特，因为他们主张永远保持占领制度，主张间谍组织在西柏林继续活动，主张备战。
    声明又说，西德总理阿登纳在西柏林集会上的讲话，再次证明他是和平解决德国问题、缓和紧张局势和裁军的敌人。
    声明指出，必须商定实现苏联政府在关于柏林问题的照会中所提出的建议。这将会缓和整个德国和欧洲的紧张局势，并且会成为缔结对德和约谈判的第一阶段。
    格罗提渥在声明中强调说，在自由城市的地位中，西柏林的经济将摆脱片面的依赖状况。十年来一直使西柏林感到烦恼的失业现象就可以彻底消灭。
    新华社柏林5日电  德国民主妇女联合会主席伊·蒂勒说，“西方占领者把西柏林变为威胁世界和平，煽动，堕落和非道德的泥坑，而苏联政府的建议强烈地代表了德国妇女的利益”。这是她在今天写给苏联妇女的信中说的。
    这封信中还说，民主德国妇女以感激的心情欢迎苏联政府关于把西柏林变为非军事的自由城市的建议。
    这封信最后表示，德国妇女保证更加努力加强和苏联妇女的联系，共同反对原子战争贩子。
