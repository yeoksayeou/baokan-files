Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: Railway departments across the country seized the opportunity of lower coal and other material transportation volumes at the beginning of the month, and from the 1st to the 3rd, they carried out a surprise transportation of a large number of daily necessities and industrial raw materials to supply the needs of urban and rural markets. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen provinces and cities including Liaoning, Henan, and Anhui, more than 143,200 tons of various agricultural and sideline products and daily industrial products were transported in these three days, including 10,042 tons of cotton and tobacco, more than 43,000 live pigs, 14,659 tons of non-staple foods, and 28,364 tons of daily industrial products. In many areas, the volume of material transportation in these three days has increased by one to several times compared to usual. Some areas, after the surprise transportation, have basically eliminated the large backlog of daily necessities. For example, the 52 stations along the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway in Hubei Province have basically eliminated the backlog of daily necessities after these three days of concentrated loading and transportation.

The Party committees, commercial departments, and railway departments in many regions have attached great importance to this surprise transportation. Some Party committees personally deployed and led the organization, arrangement, and short-distance transportation of goods. For example, the Minister of the Finance and Trade Department of the CPC Jinhua Prefectural Committee in Zhejiang Province led a work team to various counties to specifically arrange the surprise transportation work; the Dongyang County Committee of this special zone mobilized more than 5,000 people to transport agricultural products scattered in the countryside to the railway line in a concentrated manner, waiting for loading and transportation. Heads of commercial departments in provinces and cities such as Liaoning, Hunan, Shanxi, and Shanghai also held emergency meetings overnight to mobilize the vast number of employees to strengthen the preparation of goods. The commercial department of Chenxian Special Zone in Hunan not only concentrated a large number of materials to the railway station during these few days to ensure the needs of the surprise transportation, but also prepared to collect all the processed agricultural products from various places to the station before the 10th to ensure the needs of regular transportation. Railway departments in many areas have also made it possible to allocate vehicles as soon as goods are available, and put forward the slogan of "more loading, faster loading, and ensuring quality." The Hengyang Railway Department has transported all the materials concentrated by the commercial department along the railway line in a concentrated manner within these three days.

However, due to the relatively rushed preparation time for this surprise transportation and the late notification to grassroots units, the commercial departments and railway bureaus (stations) in individual areas did not cooperate closely enough. Therefore, there were some problems in the concentration of materials and the allocation of vehicles, and not all the materials that should have been transported were transported in time. At present, all regions are carrying out more thorough preparations, and they guarantee that while doing a good job in regular transportation, they will achieve a greater victory in the surprise transportation around December 10 than this time.

Beijing News: The Beijing area railway system implemented the Ministry of Railways' instructions to appropriately arrange and carry out a surprise transportation campaign of daily necessities and non-staple foods from December 1st, while ensuring the transportation tasks of the "Marshal" and key capital construction project materials are completed.

The Beijing Railway Office and its affiliated stations contacted commercial departments to arrange freight transportation. So far, it has been agreed to increase the transportation volume of daily necessities and non-staple foods by 263 cars (approximately 7,890 tons) in addition to the original transportation plan for this month. The types of freight transported within the Beijing area include cattle, sheep, and pigs transported to Beijing from Miyun, Huairou, and other places; Chinese flowering crabapples, persimmons and other fruits transported from mountainous areas such as Miyun; and daily necessities such as woolen yarn, towels, and soap transported from Beijing to the Beijing-Baotou line. The materials jointly transported by railways with foreign regions include ice transported from Beijing to Changsha, Hengyang and other places for cold storage along the way for aquatic products transported from the south to Beijing.

Since the start of the surprise campaign, from the 1st to the 5th of this month, 253 cars, totaling about 8,300 tons, have been transported within the Beijing area railway.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th Dispatch: The Shanghai Railway Bureau organized a surprise transportation of people's daily necessities on its railway lines from the 1st to the 4th. In four days, the bureau transported a total of more than 5,000 tons of chickens, ducks, pigs, sheep, aquatic products, cured products, and vegetables in whole cars from the rural areas along the line. In addition to supplying Shanghai, Jinan, and other places in East China, they were also transported to cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Changchun. The bureau also transported more than 6,800 tons of general merchandise, knitwear, and cigarettes from cities along the line such as Shanghai and Wuxi to supply various rural areas.

Now, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has begun to prepare for goods and vehicles, planning to organize another surprise transportation of people's daily necessities around the 10th to increase the supply to urban and rural people. (Attached picture)

    各地抓空隙  巧结合  组织突击运输
    大量生活必需品进城下乡
    新华社6日讯  全国铁路部门抓紧月初煤炭等物资运输量较少的机会，在1日至3日突击运输了大批日用生活必需品和工业原料供应城乡市场的需要。据辽宁、河南、安徽十八个省、市的不完全统计，三天内共突击运输各种农副产品和日用工业品十四万三千二百多吨，其中棉花、烟叶一万零四十二吨，生猪四万三千多头，副食品一万四千六百五十九吨，日用工业品二万八千三百六十四吨。不少地区这三天的物资运输量比平时增加了一倍至几倍。有些地区经过突击运输，已经基本上消除了生活必需品的大量积压现象。如京广铁路在湖北境内的五十二个车站经过这三天的突击装运，生活必需品已基本上没有积压。
    许多地区的党委、商业部门、铁道部门对于这次突击运输都非常重视。有些党委亲自部署和领导了货源的组织、安排及短途运输工作。如中共浙江省金华地委财贸部部长率领工作组到各县具体安排突击运输工作；这个专区的东阳县委发动群众五千多人把分散在农村的农产品突击搬运到铁路沿线，等待装运。辽宁、湖南、山西、上海等省、市的商业部门负责人也连夜召开紧急会议发动广大职工，加强货源准备工作。湖南郴县专区商业部门不但在这几天把大量物资集中到铁路车站，保证了突击运输的需要，而且还准备把各地已经加工好的农产品在10日以前都集运到车站上来，以保证经常运输的需要。许多地区的铁道部门也做到了有货就拨给车辆，并且提出了“多装、快装、保证质量”的口号，衡阳铁路部门在这三天内已将商业部门集中在铁路沿线的物资全部突击运走。
    但是这次突击运输由于准备时间比较仓促，基层单位接到通知比较晚，个别地区商业部门和铁路局（车站）相互配合得不够密切，因此在物资的集中和车辆的调拨等方面都存在一些问题，没有能把应当运出的物资都及时运出来。目前各地正在进行更充分的准备工作，他们保证在做好经常运输的同时，要使12月10日左右的突击运输取得比这一次更大的胜利。
    本报讯  北京地区铁路系统贯彻铁道部在保证完成“元帅”及重点基建工程用料的运输任务情况下，适当安排，突击运输生活日用品和副食品的指示，从12月1日起，开展了生活日用品和副食品的突击运输旬。
    北京铁路办事处和所属各站和商业部门联系，安排货运。到目前为止，已经商定在本月份原定运输计划之外，增加日用品和副食品运量二百六十三车（约合七千八百九十多吨）。北京地区内货运的种类，包括从密云、怀柔等地运京的牛、羊、猪；从密云等山区运进的海棠、柿子等水果；从北京运往京包线的绒线、毛巾和肥皂等日用品。对外区铁路联运的物资，有从北京运往长沙、衡阳等地的冰，供从南方运京水产沿途冷藏之用。
    突击旬开始以后，从本月1日到5日，北京地区铁路范围内，已经运输二百五十三车，约合八千三百多吨。
    据新华社上海6日电  上海铁路局1日到4日在所属的各铁路线上组织了一次人民生活必需品的突击运输，四天里，这个局从沿线农村整车运出的鸡鸭、猪羊、水产、腌腊品、蔬菜等共达五千多吨，除就近供应华东地区的上海、济南等地外，还远途运往北京、天津、沈阳、长春等城市。这个局从上海、无锡等沿线城市运出的日用百货、针棉织品、卷烟等也有六千八百多吨，供应了各地农村。
    现在，上海铁路局又已着手作货源、车辆等各项准备，计划在10日左右再组织一次人民生活必需品的突击运输，以增加对城乡人民的供应。（附图片）
