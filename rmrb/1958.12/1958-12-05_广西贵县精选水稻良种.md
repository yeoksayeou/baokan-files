    Guangxi Guixian Carefully Selects Fine Rice Varieties
    According to the Guangxi Daily, while carrying out the busy autumn harvest, Guixian seized the work of selecting fine rice varieties and organized more than 25,000 people to invest in this movement.
    In order to select good varieties and ensure the realization of next year's grain production plan, during the movement, each commune first conducted a comprehensive identification of good varieties, and then organized forces to adopt effective measures such as block selection, panicle selection, and single cutting, single threshing, and single drying to carry out a concentrated seed selection movement. For example, 1,200 people from the Xishan Commune participated in seed selection, and the whole commune had selected 910,000 catties of seeds. The Daxu Commune mobilized more than 5,000 people and completed the seed selection task of 4.1 million catties.
    Furthermore, in order to promote a universal leap forward in agricultural production next year, the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County is carefully selecting high-quality glutinous rice varieties produced locally to support other areas. The county organized more than 30,000 key commune members to form a special seed selection force. People of all ethnic groups regard participating in seed selection and retention as a very glorious thing, and achieve special selection, special drying, and special management, putting forward the slogan: "No good seeds will leave the village or the county." In order to ensure the completion of the task of transferring fine varieties to other places, commune members do not eat a single grain of the newly harvested and fragrant glutinous rice, and would rather go to Guizhou and Hunan to buy rice to make up for the shortage of food rations. At present, more than 27 million catties of good seeds that have been selected are being shipped to other places one after another.

    广西贵县精选水稻良种
    据广西日报消息  在紧张秋收的同时，贵县抓住了选好水稻良种的工作，组织了二万五千多人投入这一运动。
    为了选好良种，保证实现明年粮食增产计划，在运动中，各公社都首先进行全面鉴定良种工作，再组织力量，采取块选、穗选双管齐下以及单割、单打、单晒的有效措施，开展突击选种运动。如西山公社一千二百人参加选种，全社已选种九十一万斤，大墟公社出动五千多人，完成了四百一十万斤的选种任务。
    又讯：为了明年农业生产的普遍跃进，三江侗族自治县正在精选本地出产的粳糯稻良种，支援外地。全县共组织骨干社员三万多人，成立专门的选种大军。各族人民都把参加选种留种工作当作一件非常光荣的事情来办，并做到专人选、专人晒、专人管，提出：“不是良种不出村、不过县”的口号。社员们为了保证完成良种外调任务，已收的又新又香的粳糯稻一颗不吃，口粮不足宁愿到贵州、湖南买米吃。目前，已选好的二千七百多万斤良种，正陆续运往外地。
