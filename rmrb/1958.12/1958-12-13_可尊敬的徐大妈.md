    Respectable Aunt Xu
    These past few days, cook Aunt Xu has noticed that commune member Wang Chengshan's appetite has decreased compared to before. He always leaves a little rice and half of his vegetables uneaten at each meal. Aunt Xu thought to herself, "If the food isn't tasty, why is everyone else eating it all up, but he's the only one leaving leftovers?" She was really puzzled. She kept wanting to chat with Wang Chengshan to find out what was going on, but she was always too busy and never had the chance.
    As luck would have it, one afternoon, Wang Chengshan's wife came to the canteen to help pickle vegetables, and Aunt Xu started chatting with her. She learned that the story was like this: Wang Chengshan was originally from Shandong, and he only settled in Langya, Chuzhou County, Anhui, twenty years ago. Over the years, his lifestyle has changed a lot, but he still prefers Northern flavors in his dishes. For example, green onions, raw garlic, and pepper are indispensable in every dish. After the commune set up the canteen, he worried that the taste of the food wouldn't suit the locals. Therefore, when everyone handed over their private plots to the canteen for unified management, he couldn't bear to. Because his private plot was growing several patches of green onions, garlic, and pepper, and he planned to eat at the canteen for a while to see if it suited his taste. If it didn't, he would withdraw and cook for himself.
    Aunt Xu finally understood. She thought, "This is easy to solve." The next day, accountant Liu Biyuan happened to be going to the western mountains to buy pigs, and Aunt Xu asked him to try to buy a few taels of pepper and a few pounds of green onions to bring back.
    Two days later, commune member Wang Chengshan's appetite suddenly improved. Every dish suited his taste, and the rice tasted even better. Wang Chengshan was also a little surprised and asked the commune member eating next to him, "Do you also like this flavor of food?" The commune member was a bit baffled by the question and could only say, "It's still the same as usual!" He then picked up a piece of vegetable and put it in front of him. Wang Chengshan put it in his mouth to taste it, and it was still bland, without any spiciness or pungent smell. At this point, Wang Chengshan seemed to understand a little, but he was still a bit puzzled. That evening, when he went to the kitchen to get his food, he saw Aunt Xu scoop his food from the pot and then walk to the cupboard. She opened a crock pot, scooped out a spoonful of greenish-looking pepper sauce, and then took a small pinch of chopped green onions from a small crock pot, placing them in his bowl before handing it to Wang Chengshan. She said with a smile, "Try it and see if it's spicy enough? If it's not spicy enough, I'll add a little more for you." Wang Chengshan looked at Aunt Xu's kind and sincere smile, and his face flushed. He quickly took the bowl and said, "Just right! Just right!"
    That night, Wang Chengshan stayed up very late. The next day, as soon as it was dawn, he went to the sixth company headquarters of the Langya People's Commune to hand over his four-tenths of a private plot to the canteen for unified management and said that he would never withdraw again.

    可尊敬的徐大妈
    这几天，炊事员徐大妈，发现社员王成山的饭量比以前减少了，每顿饭总要剩一点，菜要剩一半。徐大妈心里想：“要说菜烧得没味，为什么别人都吃得光光的，唯独他却吃剩下来呢？”实在有点纳闷。她老想找王成山拉呱拉呱，可是由于事情忙，总没机会跟他拉。
    说来也凑巧，一天下午，王成山老婆到食堂来帮助腌菜，徐大妈就跟她拉呱上了。一了解，原来竟是这么一回事：王成山原是山东人，二十年前才到安徽滁县琅琊这个地方落户。这些年，他的生活习惯已改变了不少，不过平日吃菜，仍是北方的口味。例如大葱、生蒜、胡椒啦，每样菜里都离不了这些调料。公社办起食堂后，他就顾虑吃菜口味与本地人合不来。因此，当大家把自留地都交给食堂统一经营时，他却舍不得。因为他的自留地上正长着几畦大葱、蒜和胡椒，准备在食堂吃一个时候看，如不合口味，就退出自己起伙。
    徐大妈这才明白了，她想：这个好办。第二天，正好会计刘必元要到西山里去买猪，徐大妈要他设法买几两胡椒和几斤大葱带回来。
    过了两天之后，社员王成山的胃口突然好起来，顿顿菜都合口味，饭也觉得更香了。王成山心里也有点奇怪，便向在他旁边吃饭的社员问道：“你们也喜欢吃这样口味的菜吗？”这个社员被问得有点莫名其妙，只得说：“还不是和往常一样！”说着就夹了一筷菜送到他面前，王成山放到嘴里尝尝，还是淡淡的，一点辣腥气也没有。这时，王成山心里似乎有点明白，可是还有些不解。当天晚上，到厨房里打菜，他看到徐大妈将他的菜从锅里打起以后，又走到碗橱旁边，揭开一个瓦罐，从里面舀起一勺青丝丝的胡椒酱，然后又从一个小瓦罐里拈了一小撮葱花，先后放在菜碗里，这才递给王成山。并笑眯眯的对他说：“你尝一尝，辣子重了还是淡了？淡了再给你加一点。”王成山望着徐大妈和蔼恳切的笑容，脸上顿觉一阵火热，连忙接过菜碗说：“正好！正好！”
    这一天夜里，王成山很晚才入睡。第二天刚蒙蒙亮，他就找到琅琊人民公社第六连连部来了，要将四分自留地交给食堂统一经营，并表示再也不打算退伙了。（泛远）
