With the Party Secretary taking the lead and vigorously mobilizing the masses, the Mining Institute strives to be the best in physical exercise.

The Beijing Mining Institute, one of the National Red Flag Colleges for physical exercise, has made another leap forward in its physical training program. As of the end of November, all healthy students at the institute had passed the first and second levels of the Labor and Defense System and met the standards for graded athletes, ordinary shooters, ordinary radio operators, and graded referees. Based on this widespread participation, the institute's athletic level has also rapidly improved. Currently, the institute has three sports masters, eighteen first-class athletes, and five hundred and seventy-two second-class athletes, and twelve students have broken four national records in events such as the marathon. With the arrival of winter, to maintain physical exercise and continuously improve athletic levels, the institute has launched a two-and-a-half-month "Thousand-Point Exercise" winter training program.

The Beijing Mining Institute has consistently conducted excellent sports activities. Over the past few years, physical exercise has yielded significant gains. Students' physical fitness has generally improved, enabling them to better complete their studies. Students who go to factories and mines can also complete arduous production tasks under relatively harsh working conditions. At the same time, the Mining Institute's sports achievements have always been outstanding, especially in long-distance running, consistently ranking among the top in Beijing's sports events. They have won the Beijing "Three Good Cup" cross-country race championship for three consecutive years, the championship and runner-up positions in the Beijing Spring Festival Round-the-City Race, and the title of Advanced Collective in Beijing's Winter Exercise in 1955. Due to the successful promotion of physical exercise, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission awarded the honorary title of "National Red Flag College for Physical Exercise" in September this year.

The reason why the Beijing Mining Institute's physical exercise is so successful is mainly because the Party strengthens its leadership in sports and places sports in an appropriate position during the overall leap forward. The institute's Party Committee decided that Deputy Secretary Wei Ming would be responsible for leading sports work, and each general branch and branch also has a secretary or deputy secretary leading sports work. The Party's leadership at all levels not only promotes the rapid development of sports but also conducts communist education among students through physical exercise. Through repeated publicity, students truly understand the importance of sports for serving production and national defense, especially the need for healthy bodies to engage in mining work, thus consistently adhering to physical exercise. This is also an important reason why the Mining Institute's sports activities can be carried out so widely and deeply. (Attached picture)

    党委书记挂帅  大力发动群众
    矿院体育锻炼争得上游
    全国体育锻炼红旗学院之一的北京矿业学院的体育锻炼又向前跃进了一步。截至11月底，全院在校的健康学生已全部通过了劳卫制一、二级和达到等级运动员、普通射手、普通报务员以及等级裁判员标准。在普及的基础上，矿院的运动水平也有很快的提高。现在全院已有运动健将三人、一级运动员十八人、二级运动员五百七十二人，并曾有十二人打破马拉松赛跑等四项运动的全国最高纪录。随着冬季的来临，为了坚持体育锻炼，不断提高运动水平，全院又展开了一个为期两个半月的冬季锻炼“千分运动”。
    北京矿业学院的体育活动一直开展得很好。几年来，体育锻炼有很大的收获。同学们的体质普遍增强了，他们都能比较好地完成学习任务，到厂矿工作的同学也都能在比较艰苦的工作条件下完成繁重的生产任务。同时，矿院的运动成绩也一向比较出色，特别是长跑，在北京市的运动会上总是名列前茅。他们曾连获三年北京市“三好杯”越野赛冠军、北京市春节环城赛跑的冠亚军、1955年北京市冬季锻炼先进集体。由于体育锻炼搞得好，今年9月，国家体育运动委员会授予了“全国体育锻炼红旗学院”的光荣称号。
    北京矿业学院的体育锻炼所以开展得好，主要的是：党加强对体育运动的领导，在全面跃进中把体育放在适当位置。院党委决定由副书记魏明同志负责领导体育工作，各总支、支部也有书记或副书记领导体育工作。党的各级组织挂帅领导体育，不仅使体育运动迅速开展，而且也通过体育锻炼对同学进行了共产主义教育。经过反复的宣传，同学们真正理解了体育为生产、国防服务的重要性，特别是从事矿业工作必须要有健康的身体，从而经常地坚持体育锻炼，这也是矿院的体育活动能很广泛深入开展的一个重要原因。（附图片）
