New Stage of the Cuban People's Struggle Against Dictatorship
By Our Commentator

According to Radio Rebelde, the rebel army will establish a Cuban government in the areas under its control, marking a new stage in the Cuban people's struggle against the Batista dictatorship.

The Batista government was the product of the reactionary coup d'état instigated by the United States in March 1952. After Batista came to power, he implemented the most brutal bloody suppression domestically, turning the country into a large concentration camp; externally, he completely succumbed to U.S. imperialism, providing favorable conditions for U.S. monopoly capital to plunder Cuba. Although Cuba is a relatively small island nation, U.S. companies have private investments of up to $800 million, ranking third in the total amount of U.S. direct investment in Latin America, and half of it was invested during Batista's rule. Through these investments and Batista's betrayal, U.S. monopoly capital controlled Cuba's economic lifelines, such as sugar, iron ore, and nickel mines.

However, the Cuban people, with a long and glorious tradition of anti-colonialism, rose up to fight against the dictatorship from the first day Batista was put on the throne by his American masters. As the Batista dictatorship intensified its cruel suppression, the Cuban people's struggle against dictatorship became more and more magnificent. The Castro-led rebel movement is currently the main force in the Cuban people's armed struggle against the dictatorship. With the support of the Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party), workers, peasants, and patriotic masses, the rebel army has grown from a force of more than eighty people two years ago to a well-armed force of more than eleven thousand people today. The guerrilla activity area has expanded from the Sierra Maestra mountains in Oriente Province to six provinces across Cuba.

Due to the continuous victories of the armed struggle, the Cuban rebel army has actually controlled one-third of the country, and has established schools, implemented its own taxation measures, and established its own judicial system in the areas it controls. Therefore, a situation of two coexisting regimes has long existed in Cuba. In a statement issued to resist Batista's election fraud, the Cuban People's Socialist Party called for the formation of a provisional government based on the progressive and democratic forces in Cuba to replace the current government. Rebel leader Castro also announced that the combat goal of the rebel forces is to lay the foundation for the establishment of a truly representative government, which will implement a democratic and progressive program including the release of all political prisoners, the realization of freedom of the press, the restoration of the political rights of all citizens, the implementation of land reform, the improvement of people's living standards, the elimination of unemployment, the eradication of illiteracy, and the industrialization of the country. The decision of the Cuban rebel army to establish a Cuban government in the areas under its control not only conforms to the common aspirations of the patriotic and democratic forces in Cuba, but will also become a major force in promoting the further development of the struggle against the Batista dictatorship.

The decision of the Cuban rebel army to establish a government is a manifestation of the determination of the Cuban patriotic and democratic forces to carry the anti-dictatorship struggle to the end, and it is also a manifestation of the further strengthening of the unity of the Cuban patriotic and democratic forces. When announcing the decision to establish a government, the Cuban rebel army radio reiterated its determination to overthrow the dictatorship and expressed its refusal to accept any external "mediation, even from the Organization of American States." At the same time, according to Western news agencies, the new government's president, Dr. Manuel Urrutia, held talks with leaders from the political, labor, and student circles in Cuba during his stay in Venezuela, seeking to coordinate various anti-dictatorship forces to overthrow the Batista regime. As a result of the talks, some Cuban parties opposing the dictatorship government signed a unity agreement in Caracas (the capital of Venezuela), announcing that they would unite all Cubans who opposed Batista's tyranny without exception.

The Batista dictatorship in Cuba has long been on the verge of collapse under the strong opposition of the Cuban people and the rebel army. The reason why it can still survive is mainly due to the support of U.S. imperialism and the fact that the various forces in the Cuban people's anti-dictatorship struggle have not been completely and closely united. If the soon-to-be-established Cuban rebel army government can effectively implement the Caracas Unity Agreement and further unite all forces in the Cuban anti-dictatorship struggle, it will inevitably greatly strengthen the anti-dictatorship struggle and bring about the early arrival of the final victory.

    古巴人民反独裁斗争的新阶段
    本报评论员
    据古巴起义军广播电台宣布，起义军将在自己控制的地区成立古巴政府，这标志着古巴人民反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的斗争，将进入一个新的阶段。
    巴蒂斯塔政府是1952年3月美国策动的反动政变的产物。巴蒂斯塔上台后，对内实行最残酷的血腥镇压，使国家变成一个大集中营；对外则完全屈从于美帝国主义，为美国垄断资本掠夺古巴提供了便利的条件。古巴虽然是一个比较小的岛国，美国公司的私人投资却达八亿美元，占美国对拉丁美洲直接投资总数第三位，而其中的半数是在巴蒂斯塔执政时投入的。美国垄断资本通过这些投资和巴蒂斯塔的出卖，控制了古巴制糖、铁矿、镍矿等经济命脉。
  但是，有着悠久的反殖民主义光荣传统的古巴人民，从巴蒂斯塔被他的美国主子扶上台的第一天起，就起来进行反独裁政权的斗争。随着巴蒂斯塔独裁政权日益加紧的残酷镇压，古巴人民的反独裁斗争也越来越波澜壮阔了。卡斯特罗领导的起义运动是目前古巴人民武装反对独裁政权斗争的主要力量。由于得到了古巴人民社会党（共产党）、工人、农民以及爱国群众的支持，起义军从两年前的八十多人的队伍发展成为今天一支拥有优良武装的一万一千多人的部队。游击队活动地区从起初的奥连特省的马埃斯特腊山区扩展到古巴全国的六个省。
    由于武装斗争不断取得胜利，古巴起义军实际上已控制了三分之一的国土，并且在它所控制的地区内设立了学校，实行了自己的征税措施和成立了自己的司法系统，因而在古巴早已是有两个政权并存的局面了。古巴人民社会党在为抵制巴蒂斯塔的选举骗局而发表的声明中，就曾要求在古巴的进步和民主力量的基础上组成临时政府来代替现政府。起义军领袖卡斯特罗也曾宣布过，起义部队的战斗目标是为建立一个真正的具有代表性的政府打下基础，这个政府将实施包括释放一切政治犯、实现出版自由、恢复全体公民的政治权利、实行土地改革、提高人民生活水平、消除失业现象，扫除文盲和使国家工业化的民主进步纲领。古巴起义军决定在自己控制的地区内成立古巴政府，这不仅符合古巴爱国民主力量的共同愿望，而且也将成为推动反对巴蒂斯塔独裁统治斗争的进一步发展的重大鼓舞力量。
    古巴起义军成立政府的决定，是古巴爱国民主力量决心要把反独裁斗争进行到底的表现，同时也是古巴爱国民主力量进一步加强团结的表现。古巴起义军电台在宣布成立政府的决定时，就重申推翻独裁统治的决心，并表示将拒绝接受任何外来的，“那怕是来自美洲国家组织的调停”。同时，据西方通讯社报道，新政府总统曼努埃尔·乌鲁蒂阿博士在委内瑞拉逗留期间，曾同古巴的政界、劳工和学生界领袖进行会谈，设法使各种反独裁的力量协调起来，推翻巴蒂斯塔政权。会谈的结果，古巴一些反对独裁政府的党派在加拉加斯（委内瑞拉首都）签订一项团结协定，宣布要毫无例外地团结一切反对巴蒂斯塔暴政的古巴人。
    古巴的巴蒂斯塔独裁政府，在古巴人民和起义军的强大反对下，早已处于摇摇欲坠的境地了，其所以还能苟延残喘，主要是由于美帝国主义的支持和古巴人民反独裁斗争的各种力量还没有完全紧密地团结起来。即将成立的古巴起义军政府如能切实执行加拉加斯团结协定，进一步团结古巴一切反独裁斗争的力量，就必然会大大加强反独裁斗争的力量，并使最后的胜利早日到来。
