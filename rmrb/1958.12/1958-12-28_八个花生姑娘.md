    Eight Peanut Girls
    Fang Di Tian Zhuang
    Wu Fenglai, a nineteen-year-old Communist Party member and representative of the famous eight peanut girls from Hong'an County, Hubei Province, has come to Beijing to attend the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units.
    In the Wujia Chong Production Team of the Huahe People's Commune in Hong'an County, there is a 6.2-mu plot of very poor quality hillside land. This year, the peanuts grown on it are doing exceptionally well. Everyone who has seen this plot of land praises it endlessly. During the peanut harvest, relevant leaders from the special district and county, as well as over 200 commune members, conducted an on-site inspection of the land. People confirmed that this 6.2-mu plot of land yielded an average of 10,083 jin of peanuts per mu; among them, 1.02 mu yielded an average of 40,719 jin per mu. This is more than 22 times higher than last year's national record for the highest peanut yield per mu. The cultivators of this high-yielding peanut land are the eight peanut girls, led by Wu Fenglai. The oldest of them is only twenty years old, and the youngest is only fourteen.
    If you were to talk about peanut planting experience, before this year, these eight girls were nothing compared to many farmers in the commune. It's true that they had all grown peanuts in the past, but for many years they had only been in subordinate positions, doing whatever they were told. Planting peanuts according to their own ideas, except for Wu Fenglai, Li Huaqing, and Wu Guoqing, only started this year; Wu Fenglai and the other two only started last year. So why were they able to create such an astonishing high-yield record? Wu Fenglai's answer to this question is: "The most important thing is that we listen to the Party. We do whatever the Party calls us to do."
    Last year, when the Hong'an County Party Committee called on all rural cadres to plant experimental plots, Wu Fenglai thought: "Why don't we also respond to the Party's call and plant an experimental plot like the cadres?" She then organized an experimental group with Li Huaqing and Wu Guoqing, and together they planted a five-fen peanut experimental plot, achieving a great harvest with an average yield of 1,600 jin of peanuts per mu. They were therefore the first in the county to be awarded the title of "peanut girls," and in January of this year, they attended the county's agricultural labor model conference and received a red flag from the county committee. It was also at that meeting that the county committee issued a call to everyone to strive to achieve a "double thousand-jin county," meaning that the average yield per mu of both grain and peanuts in the county could reach 1,000 jin. After returning to their village from the county, Wu Fenglai immediately discussed with her companions and decided to respond to the Party's call with even greater achievements this year. Subsequently, they expanded the experimental group to eight people and also expanded the area of the experimental plot.
    In the process of striving for high peanut yields, they encountered many difficulties, the biggest of which was the obstruction and attacks of the conservatives. Even when they had just started selecting the land, the conservatives came out to obstruct them. However, in order to respond to the Party's call, they were not afraid of anything. They were determined to answer the conservatives with facts. Take the selection of land, for example. At first, they planned to continue the experiment on the same plot of land as last year, only increasing the area. But when this request was made to the team, the team leader, Wu Hengquan, disagreed, saying to them: "I can't make the decision. I have to get the consent of the masses before I can decide." But after waiting for several days, he did not call a mass meeting to discuss this matter. He simply did not believe that their experiment would succeed. The so-called consultation with the masses was just an excuse. The girls saw this and went to the Party branch secretary, Li Haiqing. Under Li Haiqing's urging, Wu Hengquan had no choice but to convene a mass meeting of the entire team. But at the meeting, he not only did not try to persuade those with conservative ideas, but instead supported those people. For example, Li Fugui, a well-to-do middle peasant, was a person with very serious conservative ideas. He firmly advocated giving the girls the hillside land that had not yielded much sweet potato last year for the experiment. Wu Hengquan supported this opinion, which resulted in conservative ideas prevailing at the meeting. Seeing this situation, some of the eight girls had temporarily wavered, thinking that the land was too bad and that it was "too mysterious" to do high-yield experiments. But after some debate, the opinions of the eight people quickly became consistent. They decided to accept that bad land and create a high-yield miracle in it. When they told Party Branch Secretary Li Haiqing about this decision, he encouraged them, saying: "You are doing the right thing. This will give everyone a greater education. If you have any difficulties, the branch will help you solve them."
    From then on, they persistently carried out a series of struggles with the conservatives. They firmly grasped a series of measures such as deep plowing of the land, soil improvement, and bold close planting. Despite the conservatives' obstruction in every possible way, scolding them as "madmen," saying that they were "deliberately trying to become old maids" (meaning that no one would be willing to marry them), and even leading away the cattle when they were preparing the land and carrying away their fertilizer, none of this shook their firm determination. When they encountered difficulties that they really couldn't solve, they would go to Party Branch Secretary Li Haiqing; and he would always actively try to help them. For example, when improving the soil, they decided to mix 5,000 dan of topsoil and wet mud into the one mu of land they planned to use for special high-yield experiments (which was later confirmed to be 1.02 mu). When implementing this, they encountered the difficulty of insufficient labor. They had asked the team for support, but Wu Hengquan refused. In the end, they went to Li Haiqing, and as a result, Li Haiqing mobilized some people from other teams to help them, solving the problem of insufficient labor.
    Many experienced people, after visiting the peanut experimental plot of the eight peanut girls, praised their technical measures, including deep plowing of the land, soil improvement, increasing base fertilizer, selecting good seeds, high-density planting, cultivating the soil and hilling up the plants, as well as appropriate irrigation and pest and disease control, all of which were well adapted to the needs of peanut growth. Among these, there are many new creations in peanut cultivation and management, especially high-density planting, which is of great significance for high peanut yields and can be said to have pointed out a new path. Who would have ever thought that one mu of peanut land could be planted with 400,000 seedlings? But these eight girls not only thought about it, but actually did it. Their experience thoroughly shattered the superstition that peanuts cannot be planted in high density, proving that as long as other measures are closely followed and adapted to the requirements of high-density planting, it is entirely possible to obtain ideal yields. And it is precisely in these areas that they have handled things very well.
    In order to familiarize themselves with the characteristics of peanuts and master their different needs at different stages, they put in tremendous labor. In addition to carefully summarizing last year's experiences and lessons and constantly learning from the experiences of others, they also firmly grasped methods such as comparative research and on-site observation. For the sake of research and observation, in order to carry out management in a timely manner, they built sheds by the fields more than ten days after sowing and guarded the fields day and night. Their slogan was: "Be the confidant of peanuts." As a result of taking various methods to understand and research, it can be said that they have done this to a considerable extent. For example, when the peanut fruit needles began to pierce into the soil, they observed that there were still a large number of fruit needles that could not pierce into the soil, and that fruit needles that do not enter the soil cannot form peanuts. After further observation, they also found that those that could not pierce into the soil were generally the ones closer to the top. After research, they decided to find a way to help them enter the soil. They thought: Wouldn't the problem be solved if we raised the soil to adapt to them? So, they first selected a few plants to experiment with: they added soil around them, burying the tips of the fruit needles in the soil. After a few days, they checked by removing the soil and found that this was indeed very effective, so they used a large amount of outside soil to cultivate the soil and hill up the plants, allowing many fruit needles that could not pierce into the soil to do so.
    After untold hardships, their peanuts finally had a bumper harvest. Because many people had personally witnessed the acceptance inspection and it was indeed harvested that much, the conservatives were forced by the facts to have nothing to say and admitted defeat on the spot. People like Wu Hengquan and Li Fugui all automatically made self-criticisms, admitting that their thinking was conservative. No one scolded them as "madmen" or ridiculed them for "deliberately trying to become old maids" anymore. They have become people who are respected and loved by everyone.

    八个花生姑娘
    方堤  田庄
    湖北省红安县有名的八个花生姑娘的代表、十九岁的青年共产党员吴凤来到北京参加全国农业先进单位代表会议了。
    红安县的华河人民公社的吴家冲生产队，有块面积达六点二亩的土质很坏的岗地，今年种的花生长得好极了。所有看过这块地的人都对它赞不绝口。收花生的时候，专区和县的有关领导部门以及公社群众二百多人，对这块地进行了现场验收。人们证实了这六点二亩地平均亩产花生达一万零八十三斤；其中一点零二亩平均亩产更达四万零七百一十九斤。比去年的全国花生最高亩产纪录提高了二十二倍还多。这块花生高额丰产地的培育者，就是以吴凤来为首的八个花生姑娘。她们中年纪最大的才二十岁，最小的只有十四岁。
    如果要谈种花生的经验，在今年以前这八个姑娘和公社里的许多农民比起来都是算不得什么的。不错，她们过去都种过花生，但许多年来她们都只是处于从属的地位，别人叫作什么就作什么。自己按自己的意见种花生，除吴凤来、黎华清和吴国清外，都是从今年才开始的；吴凤来等三人也只是从去年才开始。那么她们为什么能够创造出这样惊人的高产纪录呢？吴凤来对这个问题的回答是：“最重要的，是我们听党的话，党号召怎么作我们就怎么作。”
  去年，中共红安县委号召全体农村干部种试验田时，吴凤来就想：“我们为什么不也响应党的号召，和干部一样种块试验田呢？”她就和黎华清、吴国清一起组织了个试验组，合种了五分花生试验地，获得了平均亩产花生一千六百斤的大丰收。她们因此在全县最先获得花生姑娘的称号，并且在今年1月间出席了全县的农业劳动模范大会，得到了县委奖给的红旗。也是在那次会上，县委向大家提出了力争实现“双千斤县”的号召，即使全县粮食和花生的平均亩产量都能达到一千斤。从县里回乡后，吴凤来立即和她的同伴进行了研究，决定在今年以更大的成绩来响应党的号召。随后，她们把试验组扩大到八个人，同时扩大了试验地的面积。
    在争取花生高产的过程中，她们曾经遇到过许多这样或那样的困难，其中最大的困难是保守派的阻挠和打击。还在她们刚开始选地的时候，保守派就出来阻挠了。但是，为了响应党的号召，她们什么也不怕。她们决心用事实回答保守派。就拿选地来说吧，开始时她们打算仍在去年的那块地里作试验，只是要把面积扩大些。但当这个要求向队里提出时，队长吴恒权就不同意，对她们说：“我作不了主，得征得群众同意后才能决定。”可是等了好几天，他都没有开群众大会来商量这件事，他根本不相信她们的试验会成功，所谓和群众商量只是一种借口罢了。姑娘们看出了这点，就去找党支部书记黎海清。在黎海清的催促下，吴恒权才不得不召开全队群众大会。可是在会上他不但不设法去说服那些有保守思想的群众，反而支持那些人。像富裕中农黎福桂，是个保守思想很严重的人，他坚决主张把那块去年种红苕都没什么收成的岗地给姑娘们作试验地，吴恒权就支持这个意见，结果使保守思想在会上占了上风。看到这种情形，八个姑娘中也有个别的曾经暂时地动摇，认为那块地土质太坏，作高产试验是“太玄了”。但是经过一番争论，八个人的意见很快就一致起来了。她们决心接受那块坏地，要在坏地里创造高产奇迹。当她们把这个决定告诉党支书黎海清后，他鼓励她们说：“你们作得很对，这样将会给大家以更大的教育。有什么困难，支部会帮助你们解决的。”
    从这以后，她们坚持不懈地和保守派进行了一系列的斗争。她们狠狠地抓住了深耕土地、改良土壤、大胆密植等一系列的措施，尽管保守派百般阻挠，骂她们是“疯子”，说她们“成心要作女光棍”（意思是说没人肯和她们结婚），甚至在她们整地时牵走耕牛和挑走她们的肥料。但所有这些都没有动摇她们的坚定的决心。碰到实在解决不了的困难时，她们就去找党支书黎海清；而他总是积极地设法帮助她们。比如在改良土壤时，她们决定在那一亩准备作特殊高产试验的地（后来验收时证实是一点零二亩）掺进五千担地皮土和潮泥，执行时就发生了劳力不足的困难。她们曾找队里支援，但吴恒权不肯。最后她们去找黎海清，结果黎海清从外队动员了几个人来帮助她们，把劳力不足困难解决了。
    许多有经验的人在参观过八个花生姑娘的花生试验地后，都称赞她们的技术措施，包括深耕土地、改良土壤、增施底肥、选用良种、高度密植、培土壅?，以及适当灌溉和除虫除病等，都是很好地适应了花生成长的需要的。这里边，有好些是花生栽培和管理的新创造，特别是高度密植对花生高产具有重大的意义，可以说是指出了新的途径。有谁曾设想过一亩花生地能种四十万蔸呢？可是这八个姑娘不仅是想，而且实际作了。她们的经验彻底地冲破了花生不能高度密植的迷信，证明在实行高度密植的同时，只要其他方面的措施能紧紧地跟上去，和高度密植要求相适应，是完全可以获得理想的产量的。而正是在这些方面，她们处理得非常好。
    为了熟悉花生的性格，掌握它在不同时期的不同需要，她们是付出了巨大的劳动的。她们除认真总结去年的经验、教训和不断学习别人的经验外，还紧紧地抓住了对比研究和现场观察等方法。为了研究和观察，以便适时地进行管理，她们从播种后十多天起就在地边搭起了棚子，昼夜不停地守在地边。她们的口号是：“要作花生的知心人。”由于采取种种方法进行了解和研究的结果，可以说，她们已经在相当程度上作到这点了。比如，当花生果针开下簪时，他们从观察中发现还有大量的果针不能下簪到土里去，而果针不入土是结不成花生的。再一观察，她们又发现那些不能下簪入土的，一般又都是较靠上的果针。经过研究后，她们决定想法帮助它们入土。她们想：如果把土加高去适应它们，问题不是就解决了吗？于是，她们先选几棵来作试验：在周围培土，使果针的尖端埋入土内。过了几天，她们拨土检查，发现这样作的确很有效，于是她们就大量利用客土来培土壅?，使许多不能下簪的果针下簪了。
    经过千辛万苦后，她们的花生终于丰收了。因为许多人都亲自看到验收的，硬是收了那样多，就使得那些保守派也被事实逼得无话可说，当场认输。像吴恒权和黎福桂等，就都自动作了检讨，承认自己思想保守。再也没有人骂她们是“疯子”，挖苦她们“成心要作女光棍”了。她们已经成为大家所尊敬和喜爱的人了。
