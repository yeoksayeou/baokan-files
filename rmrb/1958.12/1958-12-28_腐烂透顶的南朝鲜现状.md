    The Rotten State of South Korea
    Wan Feng
    South Korea, under the rule of American imperialism and its lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, has become a fascist dictatorship and a dark corner plagued by economic depression and widespread starvation.
      A Fascist Prison
    The Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, relying on the bayonets and dollar support of its American masters, implements fascist terror rule, turning South Korea into a vast prison.
    The Syngman Rhee clique has enacted fascist laws even more vicious than the Japanese imperialists' "Public Security Preservation Law," such as the "National Security Law," "Law on Punishment of Minor Offenses," "Law on the Control of Assemblies and Other Activities," "Direct Trial Procedures Law," and "Temporary Measures Law for the Protection of National Affairs," intensifying the persecution of the people. Recently, it has also attempted to revise the "National Security Law" to make it even more insidious, in order to transform South Korea into a complete fascist police "state."
    In recent years, the Syngman Rhee clique has been frantically expanding the suppression apparatus of police, military, prosecution offices, courts, and prisons. In addition to secret police and various terrorist elements such as gangsters, the number of formal police officers has reached more than 40,000, which is more than twice the 15,000 during the period when the Japanese imperialists expanded the police force (in South Korea) before the war. In addition, there are the universally hated American invading army and the 720,000-strong Syngman Rhee army, suppressing the democratic rights of the South Korean people. Since the Korean armistice, South Korea has added twenty-two prisons. Recently, more than thirty-one "summary courts" have been added, expanding the activities of persecuting the people. Prisons are often overcrowded. A journalist from the "Indian Times" who once visited South Korea reported, "In South Korea under Syngman Rhee's rule, the more people you kill, the more patriotic you are!"
    In the South Korean "National Assembly" directed by the United States, the Syngman Rhee clique has excluded dissidents and acted lawlessly for years, staging countless farces. During the so-called "National Assembly elections" held in May this year, the Syngman Rhee government used the reactionary "National Assembly Election Law" to control candidates, arresting more than 20,000 people, and constantly beating and intimidating opposition party and independent candidates. The American invading army and the Rhee puppet army also conducted military exercises to threaten the South Korean people who opposed and resisted the "elections." On December 24 this year, in order to forcibly pass the fascist bill amending the "National Security Law," the Syngman Rhee clique staged a full-scale brawl, injuring Democratic Party members who were resisting. One Western journalist said, "To find democracy in South Korea is like looking for roses in a trash can!"
    The Syngman Rhee clique is also intensifying the enslavement and indoctrination of the South Korean people, promoting feudal morality of "Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues," and instilling servile ideas into young students. In the "Our History" section of the secondary school "Social Life Class" textbook compiled by the Syngman Rhee clique, there is even the following passage: "The mild climate and the peninsula with many mountains have made our character gentle and our hearts narrow... Narrow-minded people become cowardly people... making them mindless people."
    For a long time, American imperialism has portrayed South Korea as a "showcase of the free world," but this showcase is indeed filled with all the moldy and rotten goods of the "free world."
        Economic Bankruptcy
    Since occupying South Korea, American imperialism has unscrupulously carried out colonial plunder. American capital has penetrated into every field of the South Korean economy, causing the South Korean economy to suffer complete bankruptcy.
    In the past thirteen years, the "economic aid" provided by the United States to South Korea has totaled 2,188 million US dollars, of which 76.7% is surplus consumer goods from the United States, and so-called "equipment funds" only account for 23.3%. After the US surplus materials are dumped in South Korea, the proceeds are used to support the Rhee puppet army and other US military expenses in South Korea. The so-called "equipment funds" are intended to strengthen control over South Korean enterprises, which does not contribute to the industrial development of South Korea. For example, some enterprises started by the United States in South Korea rely on thermal power plants that use American oil for power, and are fundamentally unwilling to develop South Korea's power industry.
    South Korea's national industry has been severely damaged. The only two steel plants (Samhwa Iron Works and Incheon Steel Plant) are now in a state of shutdown. The "Dongyang Chemical Factory" has not been in operation for thirteen years due to the influx of American chemical products. According to South Korean newspapers, from 1955 to 1957, more than 2,500 small and medium-sized enterprises that formed the center of South Korea's national industry went bankrupt. According to Reuters, 60% to 80% of South Korea's industrial equipment has ceased operation or reduced operating rates.
    The United States is doing its best to control South Korea's trade, turning South Korea into a dumping market for American goods. The United States unreasonably cuts off economic exchanges between North and South Korea, instigating the Syngman Rhee clique to refuse North Korea's supply of South Korea's needed heavy industrial products, natural resources, and power, and to sever trade relations with socialist countries. As a result of the US monopoly on South Korea's trade, in the second half of last year and throughout this year, South Korea can only supply less than 9% of its 66 major materials, and the rest must be imported from the United States. For example, 95% of the raw materials for the textile industry, which occupies an important position in the national industry, are supplied by the United States. Since the outbreak of the economic crisis in the United States, as a result of South Korea's exports being subjected to all kinds of difficulties and price reductions by the United States, South Korea's exports this year are only one twenty-third of its imports.
    In order to follow its American masters' policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, the Syngman Rhee clique has done its best to plunder and expand military expenditures. In 1958, direct military expenditures reached more than 124.1 billion won, accounting for more than 36% of the total budget expenditure. In addition, there are huge amounts of expenses for military services. This has further deepened the economic disaster in South Korea.
    Under these circumstances, the South Korean economy is deteriorating. Last year, South Korea's total industrial output value fell to less than half of that during the Japanese rule period, and it continued to decline this year. Last year, not a ton of iron was produced, and only 14,000 tons of steel were produced in the first eight months of this year. In agriculture, in May last year, there were 1.2 million grain-deficient households. At the beginning of this spring, there were more than 3 million starving people. Due to the exploitation of landlords, rich peasants, and usurers, the total debt of farmers exceeds 100 billion won. At present, the sown area has been reduced by 600,000 hectares, and grain output has been reduced by 40%. Before the American occupation, South Korea could export millions of tons of grain every year, but now it has to import more than 5 million tons of grain every year. South Korea, once known as a "granary," has become a terrible land of hunger.
    People's Lives in Dire Straits
    Under the marrow-sucking exploitation of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, the number of unemployed and underemployed in South Korea has reached more than 4.2 million. Hundreds of thousands of orphans are wandering the streets begging for food and clothing. At present, the number of homeless people in South Korea who are living in the wilderness has exceeded 3 million. Millions of grain-deficient farmers have to fill their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark, and many urban residents have to live on bean dregs and chaff.
    The South Korean people are also suffering from various diseases. According to South Korean publications, there are more than 2.1 million tuberculosis patients, more than 1 million patients with endemic diseases, and 200,000 leprosy patients. The infant mortality rate is alarmingly high, with an average of 220 deaths per 1,000 children, and the average life expectancy is only 37 years.
    The deterioration of sanitation in South Korea has reached its extreme. On June 26, 1958, the editorial of South Korea's "Dong-A Ilbo" said when referring to Seoul: "There are not many cities in the world-famous cities as dirty as Seoul. In the center of Seoul, feces and urine can be seen everywhere... garbage is piled up everywhere, emitting a pungent odor, and flies are flying all over the sky." If Seoul is like this, other places are even worse. This year, as soon as the thawing period arrived, various epidemic infectious diseases spread, and typhoid fever, dysentery, colds, etc. have swept across the entire South Korea.
    South Korea is rotting away, and the flames of resistance of the South Korean people are burning. In the past year alone, South Korean workers have launched ninety-three struggles. From the Korean armistice in July 1953 to March this year, they have carried out a total of 317 strikes and various forms of struggle. Millions of farmers have protested, petitioned, and attacked county halls. The South Korean people oppose the establishment of American missile bases and demand that American troops withdraw from South Korea immediately. According to the Toyo News Agency, on July 20 this year, a large number of leaflets demanding that American troops get out of South Korea appeared in Seoul. The leaflets were even scattered in front of the US military headquarters and the US embassy. On December 25, about 500 Busan citizens held a large demonstration at the risk of clashing with armed police to protest the Syngman Rhee clique's use of violence to pass the bill amending the "National Security Law" in the National Assembly. The South Korean people yearn for the rapid development of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and demand the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    腐烂透顶的南朝鲜现状
    万峰
    美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团统治下的南朝鲜，已成为法西斯独裁的大牢房，经济萧条、饿莩遍地的黑暗角落。
      法西斯的大牢房
    李承晚卖国集团靠着美国主子的刺刀和美元的支持，实行法西斯的恐怖统治，把南朝鲜变成了一座大牢房。
    李承晚集团制定了比日本帝国主义的“治安维持法”还要恶毒的“国家保安法”、“对轻犯的惩罚法”、“取缔集会等活动法”、“直接审判程序法”、“保护国政临时措施法”等法西斯法律，加紧迫害人民。最近它还企图把“国家保安法”修改得更加恶毒，以便把南朝鲜变成一个道道地地的法西斯警察“国家”。
    近年来，李承晚集团一直疯狂地在扩大警察、军队、检察厅、法院、监狱等镇压机器。除了秘密警察和暴力团等各种恐怖分子外，正式警察数目竟达四万多人，这比战前日本帝国主义扩大警察时期的一万五千人（南朝鲜）还多两倍。此外，还有万人憎恨的美国侵略军和七十二万李承晚军队，压制着南朝鲜人民的民主权利。自从朝鲜停战实现后，南朝鲜光是监狱就增设了二十二所。最近又增设三十一所以上的“简易裁判所”，扩大了迫害人民的活动。监狱里经常有人满之患。曾经到过南朝鲜的“印度时报”记者报道说：“在李承晚统治下的南朝鲜，杀人越多就越是爱国者！”
    在美国一手导演的南朝鲜“国会”里，几年来李承晚集团排除异己，横行不法，不知闹过多少丑剧。今年5月举行所谓“国会选举”时，李承晚政府就以反动的“国会选举法”控制候选人，逮捕了两万多人，并且不断地殴打和恫吓在野党和无党派候选人。侵朝美军和李伪军还举行了军事演习，来威胁反对和抵制“选举”的南朝鲜人民。今年12月24日，李承晚集团为了强制通过修改“国家保安法”的法西斯法案，又演了一场全武行，殴伤了进行抵制的民主党议员，一个西方国家记者也不得不说：“要在南朝鲜找民主，就等于到垃圾桶里找蔷薇花！”
    李承晚集团还加紧对南朝鲜人民进行奴化的愚民教育，提倡“三纲五伦”的封建道德，向青年学生灌输奴才思想。李承晚集团所编的中学“社会生活课”教科书的“我国历史”中竟有这么一段：“天气温和，山比较多的半岛，使我们的性格为之温顺，使我们的心地为之狭小……心地狭小的人变为怯懦的人……使他们变为没头没脑的人”。
    美帝国主义长期以来把南朝鲜当作“自由世界的橱窗”来加以渲染，而这个橱窗里确是集中了“自由世界”一切臭得发霉的货色。
        经济全面破产
    美帝国主义自从霸占南朝鲜以来，肆无忌惮地进行殖民掠夺，美国资本无孔不入地渗入了南朝鲜经济的各个领域，使南朝鲜的经济遭到了全面的破产。
    十三年来，美国给南朝鲜的“经济援助”共达二十一亿八千八百万美元，其中76.7％是美国的剩余消费物资，所谓“设备资金”只占23.3％。美国的剩余物资在南朝鲜倾销后，所得的款项用来豢养李伪军和美国在南朝鲜的其他军事费用。而所谓“设备资金”则是为了加强对南朝鲜企业的控制，而无助于南朝鲜的工业发展。如美国在南朝鲜开始开办的一些企业，连动力方面都要依靠美国油类开动的火力发电站，而根本不愿发展南朝鲜的动力工业。
    南朝鲜的民族工业，遭到了严重的破坏。仅有的两座钢铁厂（三和制铁所和仁川钢厂）现在都陷于停工状态。“东洋化学工厂”由于美国化学制品的泛滥，十三年来一直没有开工。据南朝鲜报刊报道，从1955年到1957年，形成南朝鲜民族工业中心的中小企业，已有二千五百多家宣告破产。据路透社报道，南朝鲜的工业设备有60％到80％已经停止运转或减低开工率。
    美国竭力控制南朝鲜的贸易，使南朝鲜变为美国商品的倾销市场。美国蛮不讲理地切断南北朝鲜的经济交流，唆使李承晚集团拒绝北朝鲜供应南朝鲜所需的重工业品、自然资源和动力，以及断绝同社会主义国家的贸易关系。由于美国垄断南朝鲜贸易的结果，去年下半年和今年全年南朝鲜在它所需的六十六种主要物资中能自给的不到9％，其余都得从美国进口。像在民族工业中占重要位置的纺织业95％的原料全靠美国供给。自从美国发生经济危机以来，由于南朝鲜的出口受到美国百般作难和压低价格的结果，今年南朝鲜的出口只有进口的二十三分之一。
    李承晚集团为了追随美国主子扩军备战政策，竭力进行搜刮，扩大军费开支。1958年的直接军费开支达一千二百四十一亿多圜，占预算支出总额的36％以上，此外，还有巨额的费用是为军事服务的。这又加深了南朝鲜的经济灾难。
    在这种情况下，南朝鲜经济日益恶化。去年南朝鲜的工业总产值降至日本统治时期一半以下，今年又继续下降。去年没有生产一吨铁，今年头八个月也只生产了一万四千吨钢。农业方面，去年5月，缺粮农户达一百二十万户，今年初春则又出现了三百多万饥民。由于地主、富农和高利贷者的剥削，农民负债总数超过一千亿圜。目前播种面积已减少了六十万公顷，粮食产量减少了40％。在美国占领前，南朝鲜每年可出口几百万石粮食，现在每年要进口粮食五百万石以上。素以“谷仓”著称的南朝鲜已变成可怕的饥饿之乡。
    人民生活水深火热
    南朝鲜人民在美帝国主义和李承晚集团敲骨吸髓的压榨下，失业和半失业者已达四百二十万人以上。几十万的孤儿，成群流浪街头乞食求衣。目前，南朝鲜无家可归、露宿野地的人已超过三百万以上。数百万的缺粮农民不得不以草根树皮充饥，许多城市居民也不得不靠豆渣和糟糠度日。
    南朝鲜人民还遭到各种疾病的侵袭。据南朝鲜刊物的材料，肺结核病患者有二百一十多万，地方流行病患者在一百万人以上，患麻疯的有二十万人。儿童死亡率高得惊人，每一千个儿童中平均有二百二十人死亡，平均的人口寿命只有三十七岁。
    南朝鲜的卫生情况的恶化，达于极点。1958年6月26日南朝鲜的“东亚日报”社论在提到汉城时说：“在世界闻名的城市中没有多少城市像汉城那样肮脏。在汉城市的中心区，粪尿到处可见，……垃圾到处堆积如山，发出刺鼻的臭味，苍蝇满天飞”。汉城尚且如此，其它地方更不在话下。今年，一到解冻期各种流行性传染病就蔓延起来，伤寒、赤痢、感冒等已席卷了整个南朝鲜。
    南朝鲜正在烂下去，而南朝鲜人民的反抗烈火正在燃烧中。去年一年中，南朝鲜工人就掀起了九十三次斗争。从1953年7月朝鲜停战到今年3月止，他们一共开展了三百一十七次罢工和各种形式的斗争。千百万农民，纷起抗议、请愿、袭击郡厅。南朝鲜人民反对建立美国导弹基地，要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜。据东洋通讯社报道，今年7月20日汉城市内出现了大批要求美军滚出南朝鲜的传单。传单甚至撒到美军司令部和美国大使馆的门口。12月25日大约五百名釜山市民为了抗议李承晚集团用暴力在国会通过修改“国家保安法”的法案，冒着同武装警察冲突的危险举行了一次大示威。南朝鲜人民向往朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一日千里的发展，要求实现祖国的和平统一。
