According to the Anhui Daily, since the end of autumn planting, the manure accumulation campaign in Anhui Province, aimed at creating a material foundation for an even greater harvest next year, is reaching a climax. In the month or so since November, the province has accumulated over 20 billion dan of various natural fertilizers, more than nine times the amount accumulated in the same period last year, and produced more than 200,000 tons of local fertilizer.

In the current manure accumulation campaign, various methods of large-scale burning, composting, and creating are widely adopted throughout the region, and they are integrated with other tasks. Wuhu Prefecture is currently carrying out a vigorous burning straw ash campaign throughout the area, with more than 300,000 people involved in this battle every day. In the past few days alone, the area has burned over 450 million dan of straw ash, generally achieving quality standards of being burnt black, thoroughly burnt, and burnt to a crisp. Liu'an Prefecture combines winter pest control with burning "baozi" (soil mounds) and composting, achieving simultaneous progress in manure accumulation and pest control. The area has collected rice stalks from 440,000 mu of paddy fields and cleared 740,000 strips of field ridges. Using these rice stalks, weeds, and fallen leaves, they have burned over 300,000 mu of soil mounds and built 490,000 field-side cellars and composting pits. Fuyang Prefecture combines river network construction by digging out the topsoil from the fields and using it all for composting or covering other fields to improve the soil.

In order to accelerate the progress of manure accumulation, various regions have also adopted methods such as assigning tasks at each level, conducting regular inspections and acceptance, and carrying out competition and appraisal movements. They also implemented a combination of fixed professional teams and comprehensive assaults to promote manure accumulation. Jiangdian Commune in Jinzhai County launched a competition and appraisal, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for manure accumulation. The thirty-three manure accumulation professional teams alone accumulated more than 10 million dan of manure.

In late November, a 10,000-strong inspection team of provincial, prefectural, and county-level cadres, organized by the province, conducted inspections in various people's communes, which more effectively promoted the development of the manure accumulation movement. Some problems were discovered through inspections, such as a lack of adequate labor arrangements in a few areas, and the erroneous ideas of some cadres and masses who believed that the source of fertilizer was insufficient, that the time for manure accumulation was long, and that it could be done slowly, which resulted in manure accumulation work not being carried out seriously. These problems are being quickly resolved.

According to the Jilin Daily, after the Jilin Province Winter Water Conservancy and Manure Accumulation Broadcast Conference, the vast number of farmers in the province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, bravely engaged in the manure accumulation movement, trying every means to dig up manure sources and strive to improve the quality of manure. By December 9, the number of people participating in manure accumulation throughout the province had increased from 187,000 five days earlier to 282,000, accumulating a total of 440 million tons of manure. The province built 19,331 local fertilizer plants, producing more than 990,000 tons of local fertilizer. Seventy-nine bacterial fertilizer plants were built, producing more than 2,000 tons of bacterial fertilizer.

This manure accumulation movement was launched under the impetus of striving for a great agricultural turnaround next year. In order to fully mobilize the masses to participate in the manure accumulation movement, Party committees at all levels adopted the method of great airing of views, great debates, and great character posters to overcome the right-leaning conservative ideas of cadres and the masses who feared insufficient manure sources, insufficient labor, and excessive application of manure leading to excessive vegetative growth.

In order to ensure that water conservancy and manure accumulation progressed simultaneously, various regions conducted comprehensive planning and unified arrangements for all labor and animal power, and divided the battle lines. In Yongji County, 60,000 people are engaged in water conservancy and 40,000 in manure accumulation. Yushu County plans to mobilize 140,000 people to engage in a large-scale manure accumulation movement and mobilize 100,000 people to invest in water conservancy construction. Many places have organized professional manure accumulation corps to improve labor efficiency. Daan County has already formed a 20,000-strong professional manure accumulation corps and is actively marching towards "fertilizer saturation."

In order to increase the quantity of manure, many places have actively mobilized the masses to dig up manure sources in large quantities. At present, the manure sources that have been excavated in various places include dozens of types such as peat, human and animal manure, bone meal, and garbage.

In order to accelerate the speed of manure accumulation and delivery, many places have actively taken measures to carry out wood-rail transport, ice-road transport, cart transport, sled transport, and aerial transport. Huaijia Management District of Yushu People's Commune has already poured 332 li of ice roads and delivered 10% of the manure to the fields. In order to achieve "fertilizer saturation," Wanlama Village in Daan County has mobilized the masses to make more than 100 ice carts, with an average of one cart for every two laborers. Panjiaweizi Village has reached the point where three people have a sled for transporting manure. Wanfajie People's Commune in Lishu County laid ten li of wooden rails, made twenty-four "gulu" carts, and has already started transport, achieving the goal of excavating and transporting manure simultaneously.

According to the Ningxia Daily, a massive manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign is underway throughout Ningxia. To date, more than 160,000 people have been involved in manure accumulation throughout the region, accumulating more than 9.5 billion jin of farm manure, accounting for 30.51% of the total task; and producing more than 257 million jin of various local fertilizers, accounting for 16.5% of the fertilizer production task. Tongxin County, which is at the forefront, has completed 55.8%, while Zhongning, Zhongwei, Ningshuo, and Lingwu counties have also completed more than 40%.

Due to the strong emphasis on manure accumulation by Party committees at all levels, many counties and communes have reversed the slow progress of the previous period, overcome various ideological obstacles, and made the manure accumulation movement vigorous. The He Lan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a three-level cadre meeting from November 20 to 23, which criticized various conservative ideas and fears of difficulty, resulting in a new situation. Cadres and the masses are determined to break through the manure accumulation barrier and complete 80% of the manure accumulation plan before the end of the year and complete all of it before the Spring Festival. Currently, more than 21,500 people in the county have been involved in manure accumulation, accounting for 90% of the labor force at home in the county, and the average daily progress of manure accumulation is more than 110 million jin. The Party Committee of Dongfeng Commune in Zhongning organized special personnel to go deep into the scene to conduct a comprehensive inspection of agricultural production centered on manure accumulation, and found that the momentum was not strong and there were not many avenues, so they immediately convened a meeting to study it. After the meeting, they organized labor and vehicles to carry out a comprehensive assault.

In the manure accumulation movement, various regions have paid attention to opening up avenues, excavating fertilizer sources, creating new methods of manure accumulation and fertilizer production, and improving the progress of manure accumulation and the quality of fertilizer. Yanchi County vigorously promotes composting and plans to transport all 2.3 billion jin of high-quality manure to the edges of basic farmland for composting, which will not only increase the quantity and quality of fertilizer but also save labor for transporting manure. Jiaochang People's Commune in Guyuan built sheep pen sheds on the edges of basic farmland for manure accumulation, which is fast, saves labor, and has great fertilizer effect. The professional manure accumulation company of Zaoyuan Brigade in Wuzhong People's Commune used brick kilns to burn fertilizer, which can hold more than 8,000 pieces of soil clods each time, burning 160 carts of fertilizer in one kiln.

    结合生产进行  质量数量并重  田边地头沤制
    安徽吉林宁夏开展积肥制肥运动
    据安徽日报消息  秋种结束以后，安徽全省各地为明年更大丰收创造物质基础的积肥运动，正在日益形成高潮。自11月份以来的一个多月时间内，全省已积各种自然肥料二百多亿担，比去年同期积肥数量增加九倍以上，并生产土化肥二十多万吨。
    在当前的积肥运动中，各地广泛地采取了大烧、大沤、大造的各种积肥办法，并且做到了和其他工作结合进行。芜湖专区目前正在全区范围内开展一个轰轰烈烈的烧火粪运动，每天有三十多万人投入这一战斗。只在最近几天内，全区即烧火粪四亿五千多万担，一般的都达到了烧黑、烧透、烧酥的质量标准。六安专区结合冬季治螟进行烧包子和沤肥，做到了积肥和治螟工作同时并进，全区已有四十四万亩稻田拾过稻桩，铲田埂七十四万条，利用这些稻桩、杂草和枯枝落叶，就烧了土包子三十多万亩，并做田头窖、沤肥池四十九万个。阜阳专区结合河网化工程将挖压的田地里的表土起出来，全部利用作堆肥或加盖到别的地里，改良土壤。
    为了加速积肥工作的进展，各地还采取层层分配任务，定期检查验收和开展竞赛评比运动；并实行固定专业队和全面突击相结合的办法推动积肥工作。金寨县江店公社开展了评比竞赛，大大激发了干部和群众的积肥积极性，仅三十三个积肥专业队就积肥一千多万担。
    11月下旬，全省组织的省、地、县三级干部万人检查团，深入各地人民公社进行检查后，更有力地促进了积肥运动的发展。通过检查发现的一些问题，如少数地区由于没有适当安排劳力；有些干部和群众存在着认为肥源不足、积肥时间长、可以慢慢来等的错误思想，因而积肥工作没有认真开展。这些问题正在迅速解决中。
    据吉林日报消息  吉林全省冬季水利、积肥广播大会以后，全省广大农民在各级党委领导下，奋勇投入积肥运动，千方百计地挖粪源，并努力提高粪肥质量。到12月9日，全省每天参加积肥的人数，已由五天前的十八万七千多人，增加到二十八万二千多人，共积出粪肥四亿四千多万吨。全省建成土化肥厂一万九千三百三十一个，生产出土化肥九十九万多吨。建成细菌肥料厂七十九个，生产出细菌肥两千多吨。
    这次积肥运动是在争取明年农业大翻身的推动下开展起来的。各级党委为了充分发动群众投入积肥运动，都通过了大鸣大放大辩论的方法，克服了干部和群众怕粪源少、劳力不足、上粪多了贪青等右倾保守思想。
    各地为了保证水利积肥齐头并进，对所有的劳力和畜力都进行了全面规划统一安排，划分了战线。永吉县是六万人搞水利、四万人搞积肥。榆树县计划动员十四万人大搞积肥运动，动员十万人投入水利建设。许多地方组织了积肥专业兵团，提高了劳动效率，大安县已经组成了两万人的积肥专业兵团，积极向“饱肥化”进军。
    为了增加粪肥数量，很多地方都积极发动群众，大量挖掘粪源。现在各地已经挖掘出来的粪源有草炭、人畜粪尿、骨肥、垃圾等数十种。
    为了加快积肥送粪速度，不少地方积极采取措施大搞木轨化、冰道化、车子化、爬犁化以及空中运输等。榆树人民公社怀家管理区，已经浇出三百三十二里冰道，把10％的粪肥送到地里。大安县万拉马屯为了实现“饱肥化”，已经发动群众，做了一百多个冰车，平均每两个劳动力就有一台。潘家围子屯已经达到了三个人有一副爬犁送粪。梨树县万发街人民公社铺上十里长的木轨，作成二十四台轱辘马，已经开始通车，作到了边挖边运粪肥。
    据宁夏日报消息  声势浩大的积肥造肥运动正在宁夏全区展开。到目前为止，全区投入积肥的劳动大军已有十六万多人，已积农家肥料九百五十多亿斤，占总任务的30.51％；制造各种土化肥二亿五千七百多万斤，占造肥任务的16.5％。走在最前面的同心县，已完成55.8％，中宁、中卫、宁朔和灵武等县也完成40％以上。
    由于各级党委狠抓积肥，不少县和公社都扭转了前一时期进度缓慢的状况，克服了种种思想障碍，使积肥运动变得轰轰烈烈。中共贺兰县委在11月20日至23日召开三级干部会议，批判了各种保守思想和畏难情绪以后，出现了新局面。干部群众决心大破积肥关，要在年底以前完成积肥计划的80％，春节全部完成。现在全县已有二万一千五百多人投入积肥，占全县在家劳力的90％，积肥进度平均每日一亿一千多万斤。中宁东风公社党委，组织专人深入现场，对以积肥为中心的农业生产进行了全面的检查，发现声势不大，门路不多，立即召开了会议进行研究。会后就组织劳力、车辆进行全面突击。
    各地在积肥运动中都注意了广开门路，挖掘肥源，并创造积肥、造肥新方法，提高积肥进度和肥料质量。盐池县大力提倡沤肥，计划把二十三亿斤的优质粪肥全部运到基本田地边，进行沤制，这样，既能提高肥料数量和质量，还会节省送粪劳力。固原教场人民公社，在基本田地边修搭羊圈棚，进行积肥，进度快，省劳力，肥效大。吴忠人民公社早元大队专业积肥连，用砖窑烧肥，每次可装坷垃八千多块，一窑烧肥一百六十车。（附图片）
