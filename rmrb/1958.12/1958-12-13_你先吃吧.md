    "You Eat First"
    There were forty minutes left before work. I hadn't eaten yet. I rushed to several restaurants, but they all said the food was sold out. I was very anxious, how could I have the strength to make steel on an empty stomach?

    I went into another restaurant. I asked, and the food was also sold out. At this moment, an old man beside me had just bought his meal and was about to eat. He saw me, suddenly stood up from his seat, sized me up, and squinted at the work permit I was wearing. Then he said very politely, "Come and eat here!"

    "How can I do that, old man?" I said hurriedly.

    "It's okay, why not? You're involved in steel production. Come on, eat first. I'll go eat somewhere else." With that, he picked up his luggage and left.

    "Old man, I haven't given you the money yet!" I hurried out and gave the money to the old man. He smiled and said, "It's okay! It's okay! Go and eat quickly, the food will get cold!" Looking at this old man, I was so moved that I didn't know what to say. I felt that everyone was supporting steel production in different ways. Suddenly, my heart was boiling like steel flowers.

    “你先吃吧”
    离上班的时间还有四十分钟。我还没有吃饭。我急急忙忙走了几个饭铺，都说饭卖完了。我心里非常着急，饿着肚子那有劲炼钢呢。
    我又走进一家饭铺。一问，饭也卖完了。这时，我身旁有一位老大爷刚买好了饭，正准备吃。他看到我又突然从坐位上站起来，打量着我，又眯起眼睛看看我胸前佩带的工作证，然后很客气地说：“来这里吃吧！”
    “那怎么行？老大爷。”我急忙的说。
    “行，怎么不行？你是搞钢铁生产的，来，你先吃了再说。我到别的地方去吃。”说着，他挟起自己的行李就走了。
    “老大爷，我还没给你钱啦！”我连忙赶出去，把钱送给老大爷。他微笑着说：“没关系！没关系！你快去吃吧，饭要冷啦！”望着这位老人，我感动得不知道说什么好。我感到，每个人都在用不同的方法支援着钢铁生产，顿时，我心里像钢花一样沸腾起来了。
