Shanghai, Shenyang, and Chongqing Focus on Production and Expanding Sources of Supply

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th: Shanghai's commercial departments are actively preparing for the New Year and Spring Festival's supply of goods, so that the city's people can happily and enthusiastically celebrate the holidays.

In order to increase the supply of non-staple foods for the festival, commercial departments recently sent managers and deputy managers of eleven specialized companies, along with over two hundred cadres, to production areas to assist procurement personnel in organizing sources of goods. Some New Year goods have already arrived. These include dried bamboo shoots, squid, fish maw, dried shrimp, sea cucumber, and salted eggs. Red-skinned fortune tangerines, traditionally eaten by Shanghai people during the Spring Festival, have been procured in the amount of five thousand dan, thanks to the enthusiastic support of Minhou and Longxi counties in Fujian province. Shaoxing yellow wine, Anhui qu wine, Tonghua wine, and Shanghai-produced beer are in ample supply this year and can meet people's needs for holiday drinking.

Shanghai's commercial departments have made preparations for candies, biscuits, and cigarettes needed for people's festive celebrations.

Shanghai's commercial departments attach great importance to children's needs during the holidays. Children's clothing and toys are also being actively prepared.

In addition, Shanghai's commercial departments have prepared a large number of cultural and recreational supplies for citizens to celebrate the holidays. Twenty-two types of "New Year's New Records," including opera, music, and songs, have already begun to be supplied.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: The New Year is approaching, and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee are launching a mass movement throughout the city to increase the supply of non-staple foods.

The work of increasing non-staple foods is led by the secretaries of the city and districts, and leadership organizations have been established. The "small indigenous groups" method is used to increase the production of non-staple foods. A large procurement army of three to four thousand people, led by the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, has been dispatched to various places to purchase various non-staple foods. As of the 19th, the city had purchased (including a small portion still in transit) more than 12,900 tons of various non-staple foods from other places.

In order to meet consumer demand for non-staple foods as much as possible, a mass movement to produce vegetables has been launched throughout the city. Now, many canteens in government offices, factories, mines, and schools have begun to produce their own vegetables. The Beishi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Korean Middle School, and other units produce tofu and are basically self-sufficient. In order to realize the production of 14,000 square meters of greenhouses, Huanggu District proposed to achieve three utilizations: utilizing waste gas discharged by factories and mines to build warm cellars, utilizing the south-facing windows of every household, and utilizing flower cellars. Fifteen units in the Nanshi District have now built more than 5,000 square meters of greenhouses, and four units, including the Metallurgical School, have planted more than 1,300 jin of garlic. In order to increase the supply of meat, Sujiatun District sent people to the mountains to hunt and also organized people to assist communes in fishing.

In this upsurge, all relevant units in the city have also strongly supported the production, processing, and transportation of non-staple foods. Many transportation vehicles from government offices, factories, mines, and schools have automatically come forward to help commercial departments transport non-staple foods. Units such as the Timber Company and the Industrial Equipment Company have also allocated a large amount of timber and equipment to help expand the production and processing factories for non-staple foods. Many workshops that had ceased production in the past have now mostly resumed production.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 25th: Tens of thousands of commercial personnel in Chongqing are busily arranging the supply of New Year goods for the city's people. Non-staple food and confectionery processing plants scattered throughout the city have received new processing tasks. The variety of pastries and biscuits supplied to the market during the New Year and Spring Festival will increase. Several larger food factories in the Central District have also trial-produced some new varieties of pastries. Some cold noodle restaurants and tofu pudding shops with special flavors are also expanding their premises.

The Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Commerce has made overall arrangements for major non-staple foods based on resource conditions. Commodities in short supply will be given priority to industrial and mining areas, and commodities needed by rural areas will be given priority to rural areas. Beef and mutton will first be supplied to ethnic minorities, halal restaurants, and restaurants with special flavors. Recently, the municipal commercial departments have sent additional personnel to rural areas to assist in the transfer and transportation of New Year goods. Dazhou Prefecture lacked transportation capacity, and the Municipal Food Company dispatched ten trucks and one hundred procurement personnel to assist in transporting live pigs. The Municipal Vegetable Company dispatched seventy procurement personnel to various production areas to urge and expedite the transfer and transportation of seafood and dried vegetable commodities.

    办年货  迎新年   
    上海、沈阳、重庆抓生产辟货源
    本报上海26日电  上海商业部门积极准备新年和春节的物资供应，让全市人民高高兴兴、热热闹闹地过年过节。
    为了增加节日的副食品供应，商业部门最近派出十一个专业公司的经理、副经理和二百多个干部分赴产地，协助在那里的采购员组织货源。目前一部分年货已经运到。其中有笋干、鱿鱼、鱼肚、虾皮、海参、咸蛋等。上海人民过春节时习惯吃的红皮福桔，由于福建省闽侯、龙溪等产地的热情支持，已经采购到五千担。绍兴黄酒、安徽曲酒、通化葡萄酒和上海产的啤酒，今年储备比较充沛，可以满足人们过节饮用。
    人们欢度节日时需要的糖果、饼干和卷烟，上海商业部门已经作了准备。
    上海市商业部门十分重视儿童的节日需要。童装和儿童玩具也正在积极准备中。
    此外，上海商业部门还为市民过节准备了大批文娱用品。二十二种包括戏曲、音乐、歌曲的“元旦新唱片”已经开始供应。
    本报沈阳26日电  新年快到，中共沈阳市委和市人民委员会正在全市范围掀起了一个群众性的运动，增加副食品货源。
    增加副食品的工作，市、区都由书记挂帅，成立了领导机构，采用“小土群”办法，增产副食品，并派出以市委书记为首的三、四千人的采购大军，往各地采购各种副食品。到19日为止，全市已经从外地购进（包括少部分正在途中运输的在内）各种副食品一万二千九百多吨。
    为了尽可能多地满足消费者对副食品的需要，全市开展了生产蔬菜的群众性运动，现在，很多机关、厂矿、学校的伙食团体都已经开始自己生产蔬菜。中共北市区委会、朝鲜中学等单位生产的豆腐，基本上能够做到自给自足。皇姑区为了实现搞一万四千平方公尺温室生产，提出要做到三利用：利用厂矿排出的废气修暖窖、利用家家户户向南的窗台、利用花窖。南市区十五个单位现已搞温室生产五千多平方公尺，其中冶金学校等四个单位并已种上了大蒜一千三百多斤。苏家屯区为了增加肉食供应，一面派人到山区去打猎，一方面还组织抽人协助公社打鱼。
    全市各有关单位在这一热潮中，也都对副食品的生产、加工、运输，做了大力支援。许多机关、厂矿、学校的运输大车，都自动拿出来帮助商业部门运输副食品；木材公司、工业器材公司等单位也都拨出大量木材和设备，帮助扩建副食品生产和加工工厂。过去许多停工生产的作坊，现在大部分已经恢复生产了。
    据新华社重庆25日电  重庆市几万名商业人员正在忙碌地为全市人民安排年货供应工作。散落在全市的副食品和糖果糕点加工厂接到了新的加工任务。元旦和春节期间供应市场的各类糕点、饼干都将增加。市中区几家较大的食品厂还试制出一些新品种的糕点。一些具有特殊风味的凉面馆、豆花店也正在扩大门面。
    重庆市商业局根据资源情况，已经对主要副食品作了统筹安排。货源不足的商品，将优先供应工矿区，农村需要的商品，将优先供应农村；牛、羊肉首先供应少数民族、清真餐馆及特殊风味菜馆。最近市商业部门又增派人员赶赴农村，协助年货的调运工作。达县专区缺乏运力，市食品公司派出十辆卡车和一百名采购员前去协助赶运活猪。市蔬菜公司派出七十名采购员到各产地催调催运海产品和干菜商品。
