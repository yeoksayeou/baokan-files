The lack of electricity is a serious problem in the current industrial production. Looking at the 36 major power supply areas across the country, two-thirds of them are threatened by power shortages, and it is estimated that the national power shortage situation will be even worse next year than this year. The electricity shortage is a new problem brought about by the great leap forward in industrial production with steel as the key link. This year, China's newly added power generation equipment, excluding rural power stations, is estimated to reach about 2 million kilowatts, equivalent to the total number of newly added power generation equipment during the first five-year plan period. The power generation has overfulfilled the leap forward plan, an increase of 47% over last year. This development speed cannot be said to be not fast, but it is still far from adapting to the new situation brought about by the doubling of steel production. Therefore, it is not surprising that many industrial cities have experienced a tight power supply situation.

The question now is what to do? The National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power jointly held an on-site meeting on the whole people running electricity, summarizing the experience of Northeast China and other places, especially Dalian and Lushun, pointing out a path for us: combining "large-scale foreign-style groups" and "small-scale indigenous groups" to launch a mass movement for the whole people to run electricity. A few months ago, the power supply situation in Dalian and Lushun was also extremely tense. The power supply to factories was generally reduced, and lighting electricity was even more strictly controlled. Under the pressure of this power shortage, Dalian and Lushun launched a mass movement for the whole people to run electricity, extensively mobilizing enterprise employees, government cadres, school teachers and students, and street residents, doing everything possible to utilize all potential power resources to generate electricity themselves. In a few months, thousands of small power stations were built, with a total capacity of more than 100,000 kilowatts, greatly alleviating the tension in the power supply. Now, many factories that had reduced production due to limited electricity use are no longer reducing production. Many factories that had stopped production due to power outages have partially or completely resumed production. The lights in many government agencies, schools, and streets have been turned on again. Seventy-five units in the city have achieved complete self-sufficiency in electricity, and some even have surplus electricity to supply to other units. The city's total industrial output value has reversed the downward trend caused by the power shortage and has been rising steadily.

The experience of Dalian and Lushun is of great significance for alleviating the tension in the power shortage situation throughout the country and for developing China's power industry at high speed. There are a total of twenty or thirty industrial cities like Dalian and Lushun in the country. If these cities all launch a mass movement for the whole people to run electricity like Dalian and Lushun, relying on their own efforts to generate electricity, then it will not be difficult for the country to increase its power generation capacity by two or three million kilowatts in the short term. This number is more than the total number of new power generation equipment added during the first five-year plan period.

For the whole people to run electricity, the first thing to do is to get rid of the dependent mentality of simply relying on the power sector for power supply. For a long time, our factories, government agencies, and schools have only been accustomed to using electricity, only knowing that power generation is the business of the power sector, and have not thought about generating electricity themselves. Now that the power supply is tight, many units are waiting for the power sector to build power stations quickly; especially some "marshal" factories even rely on being "key" enterprises, thinking that "anyway, my power cannot be cut off," and do not try to find their own solutions. Power generation and supply are of course the responsibility of the power sector, there is no doubt about this, and the power sector is also working hard to build more power stations. However, the power of the power sector is limited after all, and it is very difficult to rely solely on the power of the power sector to fully meet the electricity needs of industrial production and people's lives after the great leap forward. In this case, only by the whole people running electricity, that is, in addition to the power sector actively running electricity, everyone comes to run electricity, can the power shortage situation be expected to be alleviated. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear to all power-using units that the power shortage will be a common and long-term phenomenon, complaining and relying are not desirable, and even "marshal" factories must do everything possible to generate electricity themselves. As for some areas that are not short of electricity at the moment, and it seems that "life is still good," they should not have any侥幸僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖僥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖侥倖

 Today there is still electricity to use, but we do not see the threat of a power shortage tomorrow. If we do not start early and prepare for a rainy day, we will inevitably be passive.

Some people say, "Electricity is an invisible and intangible thing, and building a power station is not easy. Can the whole people run electricity?" These comrades are actually distrusting the masses, only seeing "large and foreign" power stations, and not seeing "small and indigenous" power stations. Electricity is indeed invisible and intangible, but it is not mysterious. In the world of electricity, there are many paths to power generation. Large power stations can generate electricity, and small power stations can also generate electricity; hydropower can generate electricity, thermal power can generate electricity, and wind power can also generate electricity; tides, biogas, industrial wastewater, heating boilers, animal power, and human power can all generate electricity. Generators also have "indigenous" ones, which can do without silicon steel sheets, materials can be found locally, and technology is easy to master. Large hydropower stations and thermal power stations are more difficult to build, and it is indeed difficult for the masses to build them on their own; but small power stations and indigenous power stations are simple to build, and the masses can completely build them on their own. Aren't the thousands of small power stations in Dalian and Lushun clearly there? These small power stations and indigenous power stations, although very small and very indigenous, are of great universal significance. Everyone can start working together and produce a lot of electricity. For example, a "small square furnace" in Dalian and Lushun recovers coal gas from coking, which can generate about 3,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. This year, no less than 80 million tons of raw coal are used for indigenous steel production across the country. The coal gas produced by these 80 million tons of raw coal during indigenous coking is wasted; if half of it can be recovered and utilized with a "small square furnace," it can generate more than 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to half of the country's electricity generation this year. And the construction time of this "small square furnace" is only seven days, and the construction is not difficult. As for some power generation methods with more complex technology, the masses can also learn them. Tidal power generation is a new technology. A famous expert in Dalian did not dare to say that a tidal power station could be built in Dalian, but the workers of the Dalian Textile Factory built a small tidal power station in seven days and nights. It can be seen that the masses can generate electricity.

Some people also say: If this development continues, if all factories run their own power plants, will it be chaotic? We say: Not only is it not chaotic, but it is very good. Self-provided power plants can reduce electricity without reducing production, and stop electricity without stopping production. Isn't this very good? Fuel and heat resources can be comprehensively utilized. Isn't this very good? If a new factory has its own power plant, it can also share railways, water sources, and repair shops, reducing power transmission and transformation equipment. Isn't this very good? Therefore, in the mass movement for the whole people to run electricity, self-provided power plants should be vigorously promoted; moreover, there is also the possibility of developing self-provided power plants. Some old factories originally had their own power plants, and some equipment is still idle and can be utilized. Many factories' machine repair shops and machine repair workshops, if organized and coordinated, can also manufacture a certain number of power generation equipment. As for the small-scale, indigenous-foreign-combined steel and coal joint bases that are being prepared for construction in various places, they should have their own small power plants and use coal gas to generate electricity to solve the power consumption problems of these bases.

Launching the masses to build "small-scale indigenous groups" of power stations is of great significance for alleviating the tension in the power supply situation. Any idea of belittling the "small-scale indigenous groups" of the power industry is wrong. However, this does not mean that if we grasp the "small-scale indigenous groups" of the power industry, we can do without the "large-scale foreign-style groups" of the power industry. "Large-scale foreign-style groups" and "small-scale indigenous groups" are the two legs of industry, and the power industry is no exception. Large power stations have a large power generation capacity and are the backbone of the power industry, so construction must be accelerated. Next year, China's construction tasks for these large power stations will be very heavy, and we must take out the spirit of seizing every second to work hard and quickly. At present, in this regard, equipment manufacturing, especially the manufacturing of complete sets of equipment including power generation, transmission, distribution, transformation, and power consumption equipment, is the key. This requires cooperation and coordination from various departments to support the power industry together.

It should also be pointed out that in order to solve the power problem of industrial production, in addition to running electricity, other power sources can also be used. In the historical process of social production development, people have gone through stages of using various power sources. Wind power, hydropower, steam engines, and internal combustion engines can all be directly used as industrial power. Of course, as energy sources, these power sources are all more backward than electricity; but in the case of power shortages, the use of these power sources can still promote production. At present, many enterprises still have a certain amount of old power equipment idle and unused, and this part of the equipment should be put into use. Manufacturing this type of power equipment is relatively simple, does not require high requirements for raw materials such as steel, and is not restricted by the shortage of copper, aluminum, silicon steel sheets, and large forgings and large processing machine tools. All localities can manufacture a batch on their own. Moreover, with power equipment, it can also be developed into power equipment in the future; just like many rural hydropower stations take two steps, first build a hydropower station, and then become a hydropower station with a generator.

The whole people running electricity, walking on two legs with "large-scale foreign-style groups" and "small-scale indigenous groups," is a revolution in the power industry. Party committees in all localities, especially the party committees in the cities where the industrial cities are located, must earnestly strengthen their leadership over the mass movement for the whole people to run electricity, so that the power industry becomes a veritable "pioneer."

专栏：

    全民办电
    电力不足，是当前工业生产中一个严重的问题。综观全国三十六个主要供电地区，已有三分之二的地区受到缺电的威胁，估计明年全国缺电的情况还更甚于今年。电力不足，是以钢为纲的工业生产大跃进带来的新问题。今年我国新增的发电设备，不包括农村电站在内，估计可达到二百万瓩左右，相当于第一个五年计划期间新增发电设备的总数；发电量已超额完成了跃进计划，比去年增长47％。这个发展速度不可谓不快，但同钢铁翻一番所带来的新形势仍然远远不相适应。因而许多工业城市出现了电力供应的紧张情况，这是丝毫也不奇怪的。
    现在的问题是怎么办？国家经济委员会和水利电力部联合召开的全民办电现场会议总结了东北等地、特别是旅大市的经验，给我们指出了一条道路：“大洋群”和“小土群”结合，开展一个全民办电的群众运动。几个月以前，旅大市的电力供应情况也是紧张极了，工厂的供电量普遍削减，照明用电更受到严格的控制。在这种缺电的压力下，旅大市开展了一个全民办电的群众运动，广泛发动企业职工、机关干部、学校师生和街道居民，千方百计利用一切潜在的动力资源，自己办电，几个月的功夫就建成了几千个小电站，总容量达十万多瓩，大大缓和了电力供应的紧张状况。现在，很多因限制用电而减产的工厂不再减产了。很多因停电而停产的工厂部分或全部恢复了生产。很多机关、学校和街道的电灯又亮起来了。全市已有七十五个单位电力全部自给，有的甚至还有多余的电供给其他单位。全市工业总产值已扭转了因电力不足一度下降的趋势，而节节上升。
    旅大市的这个经验，对于全国各地缓和电力不足的紧张情况，对于高速度发展我国的电力工业，有着重要的意义。像旅大这样的工业城市，在全国总有二、三十个。如果这些城市都像旅大一样地大搞全民办电运动，自力更生，自己办电，那么，全国就不难在短期内增加二、三百万瓩的发电能力。这个数目比第一个五年计划期间新增加的发电设备的总数还多。
    全民办电，首先要摆脱单纯依靠电力部门供电的依赖思想。长期以来，我们的工厂、机关、学校只习惯于用电，只知道发电是电力部门的事，而没有想过自己办电。现在电力供应紧张，许多单位就等待着电力部门快建电站；特别是一些“元帅”工厂更自恃是“重点”，认为“反正不能停我的电”，而不去自己想办法。发电、供电，当然是电力部门的事，这是没有疑问的，电力部门也正在快马加鞭，建设更多的电站。但是，电力部门的力量毕竟有限，单靠电力部门的力量，来全部满足大跃进以后工业生产用电和人民生活用电的需要却是很困难的。在这种情况下，只有全民办电，即除了电力部门积极办电之外，大家都来办电，电力不足的情况才可望缓和。因此，一定要向一切用电单位讲清楚：电力不足将是一个普遍的、长期的现象，埋怨情绪、依赖思想都是要不得的，即便是“元帅”工厂，也要千方百计自己动手办电。至于有些地区眼前还不缺电，好像“日子还好过”，也不应该心存侥幸。俗语说：“人无远虑，必有近忧”。今天还有电用，就看不到明天缺电的威胁，不及早下手，未雨绸缪，势必被动。
    有人说：“电是看不见摸不着的玩艺，建设一个电站谈何容易。全民办电能办起来吗？”这些同志实际上是不相信群众，只看见“大而洋”的电站，看不见“小而土”的电站。电，确实看不见，摸不着，但并不神秘。在电的世界中，有许多条通向发电的道路。大电站能发电，小电站也能发电；水力能发电，火力能发电，风力也能发电；潮汐、沼气、工业废水、暖气锅炉、畜力、人力都能发电。发电机也有“土”的，可以不用矽钢片，材料能就地找，技术也容易掌握。大的水电站和火电站建设起来比较费事，群众自办确有困难；但小的电站、土的电站建设简便，却是群众自己完全可以办起来的。旅大市的几千个小电站不是明摆在那儿吗？这些小的电站、土的电站，虽然很小、很土，却很有普遍意义，大家都动起手来，就可以生产很多电力。例如旅大市的一种“小方型炉”回收炼焦的煤气，每天可以发电三千度左右。全国今年用于土钢生产的原煤不下八千万吨，这八千万吨原煤在土法炼焦时所产生的煤气都被白白放走了；如果其中有一半能用“小方型炉”回收利用，就可以发出一百多亿度电，相当于今年全国发电量的半数。而这种“小方型炉”的建设时间才不过七天，建设并不费事。至于一些技术比较复杂的发电方法，群众也是可以学会的。潮汐发电是一种新技术，大连一个有名的专家都不敢说在大连能建成潮汐发电站，但大连纺织厂的职工用了七个昼夜，就建成了一座小型的潮汐发电站。可见，群众是可以办电的。
    还有人说：这样发展下去，不管什么工厂都搞自备电厂，会不会搞乱了？我们说：不但不乱，而且好得很。自备电厂，能够减电不减产，停电不停产，这不是好得很吗？燃料、热力资源能够综合利用，这不是好得很吗？如果是新建工厂自备电厂，还能够共用铁路、水源、修配车间，减少送电、变电设备，这不是好得很吗？因此，在全民办电运动中，要大力提倡自备电厂；而且，发展自备电厂的可能也是有的。有些老工厂本来就有自己的发电所，现在还有一些设备闲着，可以利用起来；许多工厂的机修厂和机修车间，若能加以组织协作，也能制造一定数量的发电设备。至于各地准备建设的小型的、土洋结合的钢铁煤炭联合基地，更应该自备小电厂，利用煤气发电，来解决这些基地的用电问题。
    发动群众大搞“小土群”电站，对于缓和电力供应的紧张情况，有着重大的意义。任何贬低电力工业的“小土群”的想法都是错误的。但是，这并不是说，抓了电力工业的“小土群”，就可以不要电力工业的“大洋群”了。“大洋群”和“小土群”是工业的两条腿，电力工业也不例外。大电站发电量大，是电力工业的骨干，一定要加快建设。明年，我国这种大电站的建设任务非常繁重，必须拿出分秒必争的精神来大干、快干。目前，在这方面，设备制造，特别是包括发电、送电、配电、变电和用电设备在内的成套设备制造，是关键所系。这就需要各个部门协作配合，共同来支援电力工业。
    还应该指出的是，为了解决工业生产的动力问题，除了办电之外，还可以采用其他动力。在社会生产发展的历史过程中，人们曾走过使用各种动力的阶段。风力、水力、蒸汽机、内燃机，都可以直接用作工业的动力。当然，作为能源来说，这些动力都比电力落后；但在缺电的情况下，使用这些动力仍然可以促进生产。现在，不少企业还有一定数量的陈旧动力设备闲置未用，应该把这部分设备动用起来。制造这类的动力设备，技术比较简单，对钢铁等原材料的要求不高，也不受铜、铝、矽钢片和大型锻件、大型加工机床不足的限制，各地都可以自己动手来制造一批。而且，有了动力设备，将来也可以发展成电力设备；就好像许多农村水电站分两步走，先建水力站，有了发电机再变水电站一样。
    全民办电，用“大洋群”和“小土群”两条腿走路，是电力工业的一个革命。各地党委，特别是各个工业城市所在地的党委，要认真加强对全民办电运动的领导，使电力工业成为名副其实的“先行官”。
