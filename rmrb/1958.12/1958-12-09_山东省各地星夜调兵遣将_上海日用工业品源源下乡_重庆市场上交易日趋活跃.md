Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. Various daily-use industrial goods needed in the rural areas across the country are being shipped out of Shanghai in a steady stream. Since the beginning of December, the intense transfer and transportation work has been carried out day and night, with an average of more than 4,000 tons of goods being shipped out daily via water and land transport routes.

This year's peak season market is unprecedentedly prosperous, and the demand for industrial products from Shanghai has increased many times over in various places. Shanghai's commercial departments have launched a large-scale purchasing and sales campaign, doing everything possible to support industrial production and increase the supply of goods to rural areas. The total value of goods planned to be supplied to various regions in the fourth quarter will increase by 24% compared with the third quarter and 40% compared with the same period last year. The current supply of flannel underwear, cotton sweaters, cotton socks, scarves, flannel gloves, and other commodities has exceeded the highest supply volume in previous years. Commercial departments actively assist factories in increasing the production of popular varieties suitable for rural areas. The convenient, open-front health shirts, which have always been popular with farmers, will have a supply nearly doubled this year compared to last year. Among all flannel shirts, the production ratio of this type of health shirt has increased from more than 30% last year to nearly 50%. The inexpensive blended wool yarn had only twenty-eight colors last year, but this year it has been expanded to fifty. In the sales arrangement of commodities, commercial departments give priority to supplying rural areas with daily necessities such as sewing machines, bamboo shell thermos bottles, and enamel tableware, which are needed by both urban and rural areas but are currently in short supply.

In order to transfer goods to various places as quickly as possible, Shanghai's commercial departments have strengthened their cooperation with transportation units. Commercial departments and stations and ports implement joint offices or send cadres to participate in relevant meetings of both parties to uniformly arrange the transportation of materials. In order to alleviate the pressure on transportation units, they have independently equipped manpower to be responsible for the loading and unloading of goods on four dedicated commercial railway lines, and have organized and centrally dispatched the trucks of various procurement and supply stations for unified use. Commercial departments also accelerate transfer and transportation by inspecting goods at the factory, sending people to help factories package goods, and sending goods directly to railway stations and wharves after they leave the factory. At the same time, they pre-allocate materials that can load more than one hundred railcars on the platforms and freight yards of dedicated railway lines every day, so that railcars can be loaded as soon as they arrive, avoiding the need for trains to wait.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th. With the joint efforts of commercial, industrial, and transportation departments, the exchange of materials between the Chongqing market and provinces inside and outside the province has become increasingly active recently.

Beginning in November, a large number of live pigs from rural Sichuan were transported to the Chongqing market, creating a record for the highest monthly listing volume of more than 270,000 live pigs. New cotton, hemp, tobacco leaves, and other products from various production areas in Sichuan have also been continuously transported to Chongqing. Cotton and tobacco leaves from Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Henan, and Shandong are also being successively transferred to the Chongqing market.

This year's peak season in the Chongqing market also provided particularly large support to provinces inside and outside the province. This year, commercial employees in Chongqing have adopted the method of not warehousing goods, and have rapidly transferred a large number of newly manufactured materials to rural Sichuan and all parts of the country. The total amount of materials that have been transferred and are about to be transferred in the fourth quarter of this year will reach 250,000 tons. These days, commercial, industrial, and transportation departments are uniformly planning to concentrate on transferring another 250 railcars of materials to support rural areas and small and medium-sized cities. In addition to general merchandise, medicines, and knitwear supplied to rural Sichuan, there are also Phyllostachys bambusoides needed to support well drilling in Hebei, medicines needed in Shanghai, canned food for export, and glucose, etc.

    山东省各地星夜调兵遣将
    上海日用工业品源源下乡
    重庆市场上交易日趋活跃
    新华社上海7日电  全国农村需要的各种日用工业品正从上海源源运出。进入12月份以来，紧张的调运工作日夜进行，平均每天有四千多吨商品通过水陆运输线启运。
    今年旺季市场空前繁荣，各地要求上海供应的工业品成倍增加。上海商业部门开展了大购大销运动，千方百计支持工业生产，增加对农村的商品供应。第四季度计划供应各地的商品总值比第三季度增加24％，比去年同期增加40％。当今的绒衣裤、棉毛衫裤、棉毛袜、围巾、绒布手套等商品超过了历年的最高供应数量。商业部门积极协助工厂增产适销农村的花色品种。穿着方便，一向为农民喜爱的开襟卫生衫，今年供应量比去年上升近两倍。在全部绒衣中，这种卫生衫的生产比重从去年的30％多提高到近50％。价格便宜的混纺毛线，去年只有二十八种花色，今年扩大到五十种。在商品的销售安排上，商业部门对缝纫机、竹壳热水瓶、搪瓷餐具等城乡都需要而目前供应不足的日用品，都尽先供应农村。
    为了把商品尽快调往各地，上海商业部门加强了同交通运输单位的配合。商业部门同车站、港口实行联合办公或者互派干部参加双方有关的会议，统一安排物资的运输。为了减轻运输单位的压力，他们自行配备人力负责四条商业专用铁路线的货物装卸工作，并且把各采购供应站的卡车组织起来，统一调度，集中使用。商业部门还通过下厂验货、派人帮助工厂包装、商品出厂后直接送往车站码头等方式来加速调运。同时每天在铁路专用线的月台和货场上把可装一百多个车皮的物资预先配好，车皮随到随装，免得火车等待。
    新华社重庆8日电  在商业、工业和交通运输部门的共同努力下，最近重庆市场与省内外物资交流日趋活跃。
    11月份开始，四川农村大批活猪运到重庆市场，并且创造了月运活猪二十万七千多头的上市量最高纪录，四川各产区新棉、麻、烟叶等，也源源运到了重庆。湖北、云南、贵州、河南和山东等地棉花和烟叶，也正在陆续向重庆市场调运。
    今年旺季重庆市场支援省内外的物资也特别多。重庆市商业职工今年采取货物不进仓的办法，把大批刚出厂的物资迅速调往四川农村和全国各地；今年第四季度已经调出和即将调出的物资，共达二十五万吨。这几天，商业、工业和交通运输部门职工正在统一筹划，准备再集中调运二百五十个车皮的物资支援农村和中小城市；其中除了供应四川农村的百货、医药、针棉织品等以外，还有支援河北打井需要的楠竹，上海需用的药品，出口的罐头和葡萄糖等。
