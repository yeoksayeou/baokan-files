The transportation line is filled with the friendship of workers and peasants.
Hunan ships large quantities of live pigs, eggs, and fresh fruits to big cities.
Hubei transfers goods for export to areas along transportation lines.
Sichuan Province taps potential for live pigs and cured meat for export.
Jiangsu ports and stations ensure prompt shipment of non-staple foods.

Changsha, December 7th (Report from our newspaper) – Commercial departments at all levels in Hunan Province, relying on the Party committees and mobilizing the masses, are simultaneously focusing on procurement and transportation, sending large quantities of agricultural and sideline products to major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Currently, over three million people in the province are participating in material transportation every day. In November, up to the 20th, over 200,000 tons of materials were exported, exceeding the total export volume for the entire month of October by 60%. Among them, over 30,000 live pigs were transported to cities like Beijing and Shanghai, more than 10,000 more than in October. There were no egg exports in October; in November alone, over 240,000 catties of eggs were shipped to Shanghai and the frontline of coastal defense in Fujian. Over 70,000 dan of fresh fruits such as tangerines were shipped to cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin.

The Secretary of the Pingjiang County Party Committee took command, mobilizing over 60,000 people, over 1,700 local carts, and over 800 wooden sailboats from various communes to deliver sales and transport goods simultaneously. Boats are constantly on the river, and people are constantly on the road; carts flow like water, and horses like dragons. Over 80,000 dan of agricultural and sideline products were transported in one day, exceeding the total volume of agricultural and sideline products transported in the past month by 1.95 times. The Hengyang Prefecture Commissioner supervised the work. In early November, all people's communes in the prefecture mobilized 320,000 transportation troops, adopting a combination of water and land transportation, advancing simultaneously, linking short-distance to long-distance, one ring after another. In twenty days, nearly 20,000 live pigs, over 30,000 dan of tangerines, and over 130,000 catties of fresh eggs were transported.

Commercial departments and transportation departments in various regions closely cooperated, fully utilizing civil transportation tools and all transportation opportunities. In Shaoyang Prefecture, the province's largest iron-producing area, trucks returning after delivering iron ore were used to transport over 12,000 tons of agricultural and sideline products in November. In Changde Prefecture, famous for rice production, trucks and ships returning after delivering grain in October were used to transport a total of 4,650 tons of agricultural and sideline products, saving a large amount of labor and transportation costs. Counties such as Liuyang, Wangcheng, Ningxiang, and Hengyang promoted the method of driving live pigs, which the local people are accustomed to. Generally, two people can drive 30 to 40 pigs, covering 30 to 50 li per day, saving a significant amount of transportation resources.

In order to further strengthen the transportation of agricultural and sideline products, ensure the supply of non-staple foods to cities, and invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee recently instructed all regions to focus on transporting non-staple foods and industrial raw materials such as cotton and hemp in early December. The Provincial Party Committee requested that about half of the province's automotive transport capacity and 75,000 tons of railway transport capacity be deployed for commodity transportation during this period, so that non-staple foods can enter the cities and industrial products can go to the countryside. Relevant provincial departments have dispatched over 300 cadres to form inspection teams, led by Guo Sen, Minister of Finance and Trade of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Yichuan, Director of the Commercial Department, to various prefectures to inspect and assist in carrying out the material transportation work.

Wuhan, December 7th (Report from our newspaper) – Commercial departments in various regions of Hubei Province are concentrating their efforts to transport urgently needed non-staple foods, daily necessities, medicines, and raw materials for daily-use industrial products to areas along the railway lines and major transportation routes for the railway departments to focus on transportation.

After receiving the notice from the State Economic Commission and the Fifth Office of the State Council on December 2nd regarding the railway department's concentrated transportation of commercial materials, the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce convened a meeting on the same evening with the heads of commercial departments from various prefectures stationed in Wuhan to study and prepare for the concentrated transportation. The meeting emphasized that in the process of concentrating materials, all opportunities should be seized, breaking down large quantities into smaller units, combining modern transportation tools with civil transportation tools, and relying on the Party committees and the masses to quickly concentrate the materials to be transported along the railway lines and major transportation routes according to their urgency.

Commercial departments in various regions have now taken action. The commercial departments of Anlu, Jianli, and other counties that started earlier have gradually concentrated the non-staple foods for export to nearby railway stations and transportation hubs. Yingcheng County plans to export 5,000 live pigs, and cadres from the commercial departments have adopted methods such as driving the pigs and using trucks to transport the majority of the pigs to Guangshui Station.

Chengdu (Xinhua News Agency) - Sichuan Province, the largest pig-producing province in the country, transports an average of more than 3,000 live pigs every day along the Sichuan River and Baoji-Chengdu Railway to various parts of the country in the campaign to purchase and transport fat pigs in large quantities. In November, the province exported more than 100,000 live pigs, and about 200,000 live pigs are waiting to be transported at major docks and stations. In addition to live pigs, the province also processed 20,000 tons of salted pork to supply 14 provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi, and a portion has already been shipped. At the same time, 1,490 tons of frozen meat were transported using refrigerated vehicles and ships to supply Beijing, Shanghai, and other places.

Local authorities throughout the province are maximizing the loading potential of existing water and land transportation tools. The Sichuan River shipping department increased the number of live pigs transported per barge from 250 to 300 for a single layer and from 450 to 500 for a double layer. Originally, the bottom holds of barges were never used to carry pigs. Now, the shipping department has improved the ventilation equipment in the bottom holds and is also using them to carry pigs, so that each barge can transport more than 1,700 live pigs at a time. In November, the shipping department also successfully tested transporting pigs to Wuhan by raft. More than 600 live pigs were loaded onto a raft with a covered shed, and the raft floated downstream from Yibin or Chongqing, greatly improving transportation efficiency. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway specially manufactured a batch of three-layer racks to load live pigs and made every effort to adopt direct transportation and accelerate vehicle turnover, creating a record of transporting more than 53,000 live pigs in the whole month. Automobile transportation units throughout the province are also using empty return vehicles to carry live pigs.

At present, the province's commercial departments are continuing to strengthen the export of live pigs, paying particular attention to improving the quality and specifications of live pigs, requiring all pigs weighing over 120 catties to be concentrated and transported to other provinces.

Nanjing (Xinhua News Agency) – Jiangsu Province, while ensuring the transportation of "Marshal" materials, has ensured that all ports, docks, and stations ship non-staple foods upon arrival, eliminating the phenomenon of non-staple food accumulation.

In early October, under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Department of Transportation organized a transportation command post with the participation of transportation, commerce, planning, production departments, and relevant departments from various prefectures and cities to uniformly direct the transportation of various materials. After the establishment of the command post, the commercial departments not only managed procurement but also paid attention to grasping the actual transportation plan, trying to concentrate the purchased materials on the main lines to facilitate transportation. The production departments also strengthened the planning of transportation. At the same time, the Provincial Transportation Command Post concentrated wooden sailboats capable of carrying 110,000 tons of cargo as a mobile transportation force. In this way, the province's transportation plans and transportation tools shifted from scattered to concentrated, and the transportation work gradually became proactive.

During this period, the transportation department's employees did everything possible to tap potential and improve transportation capacity. For example, employees at railway stations along the Nanjing-Shanghai line adopted the method of "Marshal leads logistics, empty cars become full cars" to fully utilize the transportation efficiency of vehicles. For example, Zhenjiang Station is a transit station for distributing materials from rural areas in northern Jiangsu. In the past, sometimes due to insufficient vehicles and sometimes due to insufficient cargo to load, non-staple foods such as live pigs, chickens, and ducks often accumulated. Now their situation has greatly changed. In late November, they invited the "Marshal" to provide Shanghai City with more than 30 tons of live pigs and a large number of chickens, ducks, and other materials. The vehicles returning empty from Shanghai were also fully utilized, transporting a large number of non-staple foods to Nanjing. Vehicles came and went every day, and non-staple foods were shipped upon arrival. In this way, Zhenjiang Station, which had always been plagued by accumulation, became a "no-cargo station."

    短途接长途  空车变重车  一环套一环
    运输线上满载工农友谊
    湖南大批生猪蛋品鲜果运往大城市
    湖北外调物资陆续向交通沿线调集
    四川省挖掘潜力生猪腊肉源源外调
    江苏港口车站副食品做到随到随运
    本报长沙7日电  湖南省各级商业部门依靠党委，发动群众，一手抓收购，一手抓调运，大批农副产品源源运往北京、上海等大城市。现在，全省每天有三百多万人参加物资运输。11月份，到20日止，就外调物资二十多万吨，超过10月份全月外调物资60％。其中运往北京、上海等城市的生猪有三万多头，比10月份多一万多头。10月份没有外调蛋品；11月份仅是运往上海和福建海防前线的蛋品，就有二十四万多斤。调往北京、上海、天津等城市的柑桔等鲜果有七万多担。
    中共平江县委书记挂帅，发动各公社抽调六万多人、一千七百多部土车和八百多只木帆船，边送售，边调运。河里不断船，路上不断人，车如流水马如龙。一天运出农副产品八万多担，比过去一个月调运的农副产品总量还多一点九五倍。衡阳专区由专员督战，11月上旬全专区各人民公社出动三十二万运输大军，采取水陆联运、齐头并进，短途接长途，一环套一环的办法，二十天调出近两万头生猪、三万多担柑桔和十三万多斤鲜蛋。
    各地商业部门和交通运输部门密切配合，充分利用民间运输工具和一切运输时机。全省产铁最多的邵阳专区利用运铁回程的汽车，在11月份运出农副产品一万二千多吨。以产稻谷闻名的常德专区在10月间利用运粮汽车和轮船回程载运，共运出农副产品四千六百五十吨，节约了大批劳力和运费。浏阳、望城、宁乡、衡阳等县推行了当地群众习惯采用的生猪赶运的办法，一般两个人赶猪三、四十头，一天能走三十里到五十里路，节省了大批运输力量。
    为了进一步加强对农副产品的调运工作，保证城市副食品的供应，活跃城乡物资交流，最近，中共湖南省委又指示各地，在12月上旬，要突击运输副食品和棉、麻等工业原料。省委要求在这一期间，抽调全省汽车运输力量约一半，铁路运输力量七万五千吨，投入商品运输工作，使副食品进城，工业品下乡。省级有关部门已经抽调三百多名干部组成检查团，由中共湖南省委财贸部长郭森、商业厅长张毅川带领，分赴各专区检查和协助开展物资调运工作。
    本报武汉7日电  湖北省各地商业部门正在集中力量，把当前急待运输的副食品、日用百货、药品和日用工业品原料等，运至铁路沿线和主要交通要道，供铁路部门突击运输。
    湖北省商业厅在2日接到国家经济委员会和国务院第五办公室联合发出的关于铁道部门突击运输商业物资的通知以后，当天晚上就召集全省各专区商业部门驻武汉负责人开会，研究作好突击运输的准备工作。会议强调，在集中物资的过程中，要见空就钻，化整为零，将现代化的运输工具和民间运输工具结合起来；依靠党委，依靠群众，把待运的物资分别缓急迅速集中到铁路沿线和主要交通要道。
    各地商业部门现在已经普遍行动起来。动手较早的安陆、监利等县的商业部门，已经陆续将外调的副食品集中到附近火车站和交通要道。应山县计划外调生猪五千头，商业部门的干部采取人赶、汽车装等办法，已经把大部分生猪集中到广水车站。（许良骥）
    据新华社成都电  全国产猪最多的四川省，在大购大运肥猪的运动中，平均每天有三千多头生猪，沿着川江和宝成铁路源源运往省外各地。11月份，全省调出的生猪达十万多头，各主要码头和车站还有约二十万头生猪正在待运。除了生猪以外，全省还加工了两万吨咸腊肉，供应上海、北京、广东、江苏、陕西等十四个省、市，现在已运出一部分。同时利用冷藏车船运出一千四百九十吨冻肉，供应北京、上海等地。
    省内各地对于现有的水、陆交通运输工具，都尽量挖掘装载潜力。川江航运部门把每只驳船载运的生猪头数，单层从二百五十头增加到三百头，双层从四百五十头增加到五百头。原来驳船的底舱从不装猪，现在航运部门改进底舱的通风设备，也用来装猪，使每只驳船一次可运出一千七百多头生猪。11月份，航运部门还试验用木筏运猪到武汉成功，六百多头生猪装在搭有棚盖的木筏上，从宜宾或重庆顺流而下，大大地提高了运输效率。宝成铁路专门赶制了一批三层车架装载生猪，并尽量采取直线运输，加速车辆周转率，创造了全月运出生猪五万三千多头的纪录。全省的汽车运输单位也都利用回空汽车载运生猪。
    目前，全省商业部门正继续加强生猪的外调工作，尤其注意提高生猪的品质规格，要求在一百二十斤以上的猪全部集中运往省外。
    据新华社讯  江苏省在保证“元帅”物资运输的同时，所有港口、码头、车站已经做到副食品随到随运，消除了副食品积压的现象。
    10月初，在中共江苏省委的领导下，省交通厅组织了有交通运输、商业、计划、生产部门和各专区、市有关部门参加的运输指挥部，统一指挥各类物资的运输。指挥部成立以后，商业部门不但管收购，而且注意了抓实际调运计划，尽量把收购的物资集中到干线，便于调运。生产部门也加强了运输计划性。同时，省运输指挥部集中了共能装载十一万吨货物的木帆船，作为机动运输力量。这样，全省的运输计划、运输工具从分散到集中，运输工作逐渐转入主动。
    运输部门的职工在这时期内，千方百计挖掘潜力，提高了运输能力。如南京到上海沿线各火车站职工采用“元帅带后勤，空车变重车”的办法，充分发挥车辆的运输效能。例如，镇江车站是集散苏北农村物资的中转站。在过去，有时因为车辆不足，有时因为货物不够装运，因此毛猪、鸡、鸭等副食品常常积压，现在他们情况大大改变。11月下旬，他们就请“元帅”带了三十多吨毛猪和大批鸡、鸭等物资供给上海市。从上海排空回来的车辆也同样充分利用，把大批副食品运到南京，车辆每天不断来回，副食品就做到随到随运。这样，一向积压的镇江车站就变成了“无货车站”。
