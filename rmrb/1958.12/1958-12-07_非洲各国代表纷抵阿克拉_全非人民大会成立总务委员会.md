Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 5th: The heads of delegations attending the All-African People's Conference decided this afternoon to establish a General Affairs Committee and elected the chairman of the conference. The chairman of this delegation heads meeting was Botsio, Secretary of the Ghana People's Convention Party and Foreign Minister of Ghana.

The meeting, attended by approximately fifty delegation heads, elected Tom Mboya of Kenya as the chairman of the conference. Mboya is currently in London.

The General Affairs Committee was established after the dissolution of the Conference Preparatory Committee and consists of ten members, chaired by Botsio. The other members of the committee are: Kiano of East and Central Africa, Galal of the United Arab Republic, Mpahle of South Africa, Slim of Tunisia, Boumendjel Ahmed of Algeria, Diallo Abdoulaye of Guinea, Enahoro (Action Group) of Nigeria, George Padmore of Ghana, and Abayomi Cassell of Liberia.

John Tettegah of Ghana and McEwen (National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons) of Nigeria were appointed as joint secretaries of the conference and the General Affairs Committee.

The delegation heads also decided that at the opening ceremony on the 8th, only Kwame Nkrumah, Chairman of the Ghana People's Convention Party and Prime Minister of Ghana, will deliver the opening speech and read out congratulatory messages. The opening and closing ceremonies will be open to the public.

As of the afternoon of the 5th, one hundred and forty-three delegates and observers had arrived in Accra.

Well-informed sources here point out that Western countries, especially the United States, are very interested in this conference. Among the many Americans arriving here under guises such as "observers," "fraternal organizations," and "private observers," is U.S. Congressman Charles Diggs. It is reported that he will participate in the conference in a "personal capacity."

The propaganda strategy carried out by Western newspapers and news agencies has also attracted the attention of people here. Those newspapers are eager to sow discord among various African countries and weaken the fighting spirit of the African independence movement.

A representative from Nigeria, Chukosi of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons, pointed out that the conference should be vigilant against this Western conspiracy. He said, "The imperialists are using communism to 'frighten' the African people in an attempt to prevent them from carrying out independence movements. But we will prove that we will take new steps in promoting the African independence movement and in promoting unity among the African peoples."

    非洲各国代表纷抵阿克拉
    全非人民大会成立总务委员会
    据新华社阿克拉5日电  出席全非人民大会的代表团团长会议今天下午决定成立一个总务委员会，并且选出了大会主席。这次代表团团长会议的主席是加纳人民大会党书记、加纳外交部长博齐约。
    大约有五十个代表团团长参加的会议选举怯尼亚的汤姆·姆博亚为大会主席。姆博亚目前在伦敦。
    总务委员会是在大会筹备委员会解散以后成立的，它由十人组成，主席是博齐约。委员会的其它委员是：东非和中非的基亚诺、阿拉伯联合共和国的加拉勒、南非的姆帕勒、突尼斯的斯陵、阿尔及利亚的布曼吉·艾哈迈德、几内亚的迪阿洛·阿卜杜拉伊、尼日利亚的埃纳霍罗（行动派）、加纳的乔治·帕德莫和利比里亚的阿巴约米·凯塞尔。
    加纳的约翰·特特加和尼日利亚的麦克尤恩（尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议）被指定为大会和总务委员会的联合秘书。
    代表团团长们还决定在8日举行的开幕式上，将只由加纳人民大会党主席、加纳总理恩克鲁玛致开幕词和宣读贺电。开幕式和闭幕式将公开举行。
    到5日下午为止，已有一百四十三名代表和观察员到达阿克拉。
    这里消息灵通人士指出，西方国家特别是美国对这次大会非常感兴趣。在以诸如“观察员”、“兄弟团体”和“私人观察员”等这些名义到达这里的很多美国人中，包括有美国国会议员查尔斯·迪格斯。有消息说，他将以“个人身份”参加大会。
    西方报刊和通讯社所执行的宣传方针也引起了这里人士的注意，那些报纸非常想在各个非洲国家之间散布不和，并且削弱非洲独立运动的战斗精神。
    尼日利亚的一位代表、尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民会议的朱可西指出，大会应当对西方的这种阴谋保持警惕。他说，帝国主义者用共产主义来“吓唬非洲人民，以图使他们不再进行独立运动。但是我们将证明，我们在促进非洲独立运动并且在促进非洲各族人民之间的团结方面将采取新的步骤。”
