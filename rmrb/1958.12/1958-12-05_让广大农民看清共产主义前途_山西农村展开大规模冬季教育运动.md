    Let the Broad Masses of Peasants See the Communist Future
    Large-Scale Winter Education Movement Unfolded in Rural Shanxi
    (Our dispatch) Reporter Yang Yi, Zan Ting reports: The communist education movement carried out in rural Shanxi Province has entered a high tide. The propaganda army devoted to communist education throughout the province has reached more than 1.5 million people. In addition to carrying out small and diverse propaganda, airing opinions and debates in the fields, work sites, and dining areas in combination with production, various regions such as Ping順 [Píngshùn] and Xiyang have also carried out communist education through a "theoretical education, propaganda mobilization, and cultural entertainment" network; communes and regions that have implemented militarized labor production have also opened communist education classes; and various counties have universally promoted the experience of Wuting Village in Wanrong County in conducting political and ideological education networks. From labor to cultural entertainment and rest, people hear, say, see, write, sing, and do everything in an atmosphere of communist education. More than 90% of farmers in most areas have received education to varying degrees. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made a decision to continue to carry out the communist education movement this winter and next spring. It is necessary to treat communist education as a small rectification movement for ideological construction, and ensure that it is earnestly carried out in every commune and village, and that every household and every person receives education.
    This communist education movement was launched under the new situation of the realization of communization in rural Shanxi Province and the organization of a greater leap forward in production next year. In early September, rural Shanxi Province realized communization. The movement progressed rapidly and was warmly supported by the broad masses of peasants. However, because it was the busy farming season at that time, the doubts and incorrect understanding of some rural cadres and peasants, and the opportunities taken by individual landlords, rich peasants, bad elements, and wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas to speak ill of the communes and carry out sabotage, had not had time to be resolved. On the other hand, some people lacked a deep understanding of the brilliant achievements of this year's agricultural leap forward, and the old theories of "conditions" and the "tide-watching faction" were not completely eliminated. At the same time, a saying that production had reached its peak appeared. All of these affected the consolidation of the people's communes and the greater leap forward in agriculture next year. In response to the above situation, Party committees at all levels adopted the communist education movement. On the one hand, they organized propaganda forces to publicize the superiority of the people's communes and summarize and analyze the experience of the Great Leap Forward. On the other hand, they mobilized the broad masses of peasants to air their views, debate, and post big-character posters, to educate themselves and solve problems themselves.
    In the communist education movement, on the basis of vigorously publicizing the principles and policies of the people's communes, with the consolidation of the people's communes as the center, the masses were mobilized to focus on discussing the nature and superiority of the people's communes, as well as the relationship between individuals and communes, poor villages and rich villages, and communes and the state. After having a correct understanding of these aspects, the ideological problems exposed by local cadres and the masses were generally compared before and after, specifically analyzed, and a clear line was drawn between right and wrong. Some rural cadres and masses, after the merger of societies, concealed grain and rushed to spend public accumulation funds. They were not actively investing labor in the production uniformly arranged by the current commune. After mass debates, these individualistic and departmentalist ideological behaviors were criticized. The Dongfeng People's Commune in Xin County, which was established by merging more than 40 agricultural cooperatives from mountainous and plain areas, some cadres and members of the plain agricultural cooperatives believed that they had good conditions and suffered losses from the mountainous cooperatives. The commune leading cadres launched a movement for members to air their views and debate, and at the same time, they conducted a long-term education by formulating a production and construction plan for the commune. Because the merger of the plain and mountainous areas brought favorable conditions for developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production in accordance with local conditions, the plain area concentrated on grain production, and the wheat yield per mu next year will reach 1,000 jin. The hilly area will be built into an orchard, and each household can earn an average of 100 yuan in three years. The mountainous area will establish a large-scale ranch, and 20,000 livestock can be developed in two years. In this way, the average grain per person in the entire commune next year can reach 2,000 jin, and the average income per person can be increased by one and a half times compared with this year. Every household exceeds the original standard of living. The members saw the prospect of great development in production, and no longer entangled themselves in who lost and who benefited. Everyone agreed that everyone benefited from the people's commune.

    让广大农民看清共产主义前途
    山西农村展开大规模冬季教育运动
    本报讯  记者杨义、赞庭报道：山西省农村开展的共产主义教育运动已进入了高潮。全省投入共产主义教育的宣传大军，达到了一百五十万人以上。各地除了结合生产在田间地头、饭场工地开展小型多样的宣传、鸣放辩论活动外，平顺、昔阳等县还通过“理论教育、宣传鼓动、文化娱乐”网，开展共产主义教育；实行了劳动生产军事化的公社和地区，还开辟了共产主义教育课；各县普遍推广了万荣县乌停村进行政治思想教育网的经验。从劳动到文化娱乐和休息各种场合，人们听的、说的、看的、写的、唱的以及作的，到处是进行共产主义教育的气氛。大部分地区百分之九十以上的农民已受到了不同程度的教育。中共山西省委最近又作出了今冬明春继续开展共产主义教育运动的决定。要把共产主义教育作为思想建设小整风，作到社社、村村认真开展，户户人人受到教育。
    这次共产主义教育运动是在全省农村实现公社化和组织明年生产更大跃进的新形势下开展起来的。9月初山西省农村实现公社化，运动进展迅速，受到了广大农民的热烈拥护。但是由于当时正处于农忙季节，一部分农村干部和农民的一些疑虑和不正确的认识，个别地主、富农、坏分子和资本主义思想严重的富裕中农乘机说公社的坏话，进行破坏，都没来得及解决。另一方面，有些人对今年农业大跃进的辉煌的成果缺乏深刻认识，旧的“条件论”、“观潮派”的论调没有彻底清除，同时又出现了一种增产到顶的说法。所有这些都影响着人民公社的巩固和明年农业更大跃进。针对上述情况，各级党委采取了开展共产主义教育运动，一方面组织宣传力量宣传公社优越性、总结分析大跃进经验，一方面发动广大农民大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报，自我教育，自我解决问题。
    各地在共产主义教育运动中，在大力宣传人民公社方针政策的基础上，以整顿人民公社为中心，发动群众集中讨论了人民公社的性质、优越性以及个人与公社、穷村与富村、公社与国家等方面的关系，对这些方面有了正确的认识以后，普遍把当地干部与群众暴露出来的思想问题，通过前后对照、具体分析，划清了是非界线。有些农村干部和群众在并社后，隐瞒粮食，突击花公积金，对当前公社统一安排的生产，不积极投入劳动力，经过群众的辩论，这些个人主义和本位主义思想行为都受到了批判。忻县由山区和平川共四十多个农业社合并建立的东风人民公社，平川农业社有些干部和社员认为自己条件好，吃了山区社的亏，公社领导干部一面发动社员展开鸣放辩论，一面通过制订公社生产建设规划，进行远景教育。由于平川山区合并，给生产带来了因地制宜发展农林牧副业生产的有利条件，平川区集中生产粮食，明年小麦亩产千斤，丘陵区建成花果园，三年后每户平均可收入一百元，山区建立大型牧场，两年可发展牲畜两万头，这样，全公社明年每人平均粮食可达两千斤，每人平均收入可比今年提高一倍半，户户都超过原来的生活水平，社员们看清了生产大发展的前景，再不纠缠谁吃亏谁沾光了，一致认为是大家都沾了人民公社的光。
