Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 8th: Inspired by the widespread "Communist Labor Team" movement among Soviet workers, the working people of Czechoslovakia have also launched a competition to establish "Socialist Labor Teams."

The initiative was proposed by the miners of the Nosek Coal Mine, who completed their annual production plan one month and three days ahead of schedule. This suggestion has been enthusiastically echoed by factories and mines across the country.

On November 30th, at a rally celebrating their early completion of the production task, the workers of the Nosek Coal Mine put forward a guarantee to establish a "Socialist Labor Team." They believe that the "Socialist Labor Team" is a more advanced form of the existing socialist labor competition, which can enable the broad masses of workers and staff to better participate in the construction of the motherland. Under the leadership of the Party organization, they studied the experience of the Soviet Union in establishing "Communist Labor Teams" and the slogan put forward by Soviet workers of "working, studying, and living in the spirit of communism." They decided to establish "Socialist Labor Teams" in accordance with their specific conditions.

The example of the Nosek Coal Mine workers quickly spread throughout the country and was actively supported by workers and staff in various places. Members of the Youth League in the Gottwaldov State Precision Machinery Factory launched a competition for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team," proposing to play a model role in all aspects and strive to improve their professional skills.

The movement to establish "Socialist Labor Teams" has been warmly supported by the Communist Party and government of Czechoslovakia.

    用社会主义态度对待劳动  在各方面起模范作用
    捷开展“社会主义劳动队”运动
    据新华社布拉格8日电  在苏联工人广泛开展建立“共产主义劳动队”运动的鼓舞下，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民也展开了建立“社会主义劳动队”的竞赛。
    这个倡议是由提前一个月零三天完成了全年生产计划的诺塞克煤矿矿工们提出的。这一建议已经得到了全国各地工厂矿山的热烈响应。
    诺塞克煤矿的工人11月30日在欢庆自己提前完成生产任务的大会上提出了成立“社会主义劳动队”的保证。他们认为“社会主义劳动队”是比现有的社会主义劳动竞赛形式更高级的形式，可以使广大职工更好地参加祖国的建设事业。他们在党组织领导下，研究了苏联成立“共产主义劳动队”的经验和苏联工人提出的“以共产主义的精神来工作、学习和生活”的口号，他们决定按照自己的具体条件建立“社会主义劳动队”。
    诺塞克煤矿工人的榜样很快就传遍了全国，得到各地职工的积极支持。哥特瓦尔德夫州精密机器工厂的青年联盟盟员发起了争取“社会主义劳动队”这一光荣称号的竞赛，他们提出，要在各方面起模范作用，努力提高自己的专业技能。
    建立“社会主义劳动队”的运动受到捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的热烈支持。
