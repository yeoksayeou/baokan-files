    Resolutely Uproot the White Flags on the Screen
    ——A Critique of Erroneous Ideological Tendencies in 1957 Film Art Films
    Chen Huangmei

    In the spring of 1957, after Zhong Dianfei sounded the gongs and drums for anti-Party films, the rightists launched a frantic attack on the Party's film industry. They concentrated their attacks on the Party's leadership in film work, attempting to distort and slander the Party's literary and art policies, opposing film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism, advocating regression, and attempting to drag the film industry back to the capitalist road.

    The rightists' attack was resolutely repelled by film artists. Under the leadership of the Party, the film industry achieved a great victory in the struggle.

    Amidst the intense anti-rightist struggle, the production of art films still exceeded the target. Films reflecting the themes of workers, peasants, and soldiers were still in the majority; they were relatively diverse in terms of content, form, and style. It was evident that many people were striving to explore new methods of expression. Some of the better films shot last year, such as "Sea Soul," "Frontier Beacon Fire," "Woman Basketball Player No. 5," and "The Fifth Watch," were welcomed by the broad masses during the new film exhibition in April this year.

    This proved that some of the measures taken in the film industry to implement the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, such as strengthening the responsibility of film studios, directly overseeing the artistic leadership, review, and approval from literary scripts to film completion, encouraging the creative activities of creative teams, and promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of creative personnel, were basically correct.

    However, because the vast majority of film artists are bourgeois intellectuals, their original stance and viewpoints have not been completely changed. Therefore, their works often express bourgeois thoughts, feelings, and tastes. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the film industry has criticized some films with serious ideological errors, which has educated the broad film creators. The serious ideological struggle of the 1951 critique of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is an example. However, the problem has not been completely resolved. The bourgeois kingdom in the depths of the soul has not been completely destroyed, and under the influence of domestic and international revisionist thoughts, these dregs have resurfaced.

    Some of the art films that have already been released, such as "Deep Affection," "Basketball Court Turmoil," "The Search for Love," "Footsteps of Youth," and "Night Voyage in Fog," have received serious criticism from the broad audience. There are also some films that need to be revised after completion or cannot be released at all, such as "The Unfinished Comedy," "Who is the Abandoned One," and "Sleepless City." In addition to some poisonous weeds that directly attack the Party and the new society, many films to varying degrees expose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts, emotions, viewpoints, and tastes; even some of the better films are mixed with these things.

    In order to uproot the white flags on the screen and plant the red flag, for the great leap forward in film creation (the leap forward in film creation is primarily determined by the ideological leap forward of creative workers), especially in order to improve creation a step further next year, it is very necessary to criticize the main erroneous tendencies in the 1957 artistic creation.

    What are the main erroneous tendencies?

    Abuse of satire, using the excuse of "reflecting reality" and "intervening in life," directly attacking the Party and the new society, and opposing the leadership of the Party

    In the 1957 films, satirical comedies were particularly popular. In addition to the thoroughly anti-Party, anti-socialist, and vulgar "Unfinished Comedy," there were "Basketball Court Turmoil," "The Search for Love," "Three Comrades," "Happiness," and the original literary scripts that adopted the satirical comedy style, such as "Who is the Abandoned One" and "Visiting Relatives."

    First of all, it should be stated that we need to use the satirical comedy style to criticize some of the bad phenomena in our lives and expose the contradictions and conflicts between the old and the new in life. Satirical comedy should become a weapon to criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the people. The important question is what position the author takes to satirize and criticize.

    The position and attitude of the author of "The Unfinished Comedy" are very clear, that is, directly attacking the leadership of the Party and attacking the new society. Therefore, although it is malicious, it is clear at a glance.

    There are also some films with serious problems that are expressed more obscurely. They use the excuse of "reflecting reality" and "intervening in life," but in essence, they distort the image and life of the working people, forming an attack on the new society and opposition to the leadership of the Party.

    For example, in "Who is the Abandoned One," the author originally intended to lash out at an old cadre who had degenerated since entering the city. If the essence of this kind of thinking can be deeply revealed, and the social environment and organizational strength of our times can be fully expressed, although this kind of theme has certain limitations and is an individual phenomenon, it is not impossible to express it.

    However, this film completely distorted our living environment: Yu Shude, this bad person who did evil in the new society, was simply in an "uncharted territory." The film did not show the struggle of the Party and the masses against him at all. The impression it gives is that old Party members and old cadres, once they entered the city and became leaders, all degenerated. This is an attack and slander against the Party. And through the characters and the material life of the city that is rendered, the city and the countryside, the cadres and the masses are exaggeratedly and distortedly opposed to each other. The same point of view is also reflected in the script "Visiting Relatives." Although neither of these films were shot according to the original script (the theme of "Visiting Relatives" has been fundamentally changed), they have a common tendency: standing on a reactionary position, abusing satire, exaggerating individual phenomena in life, distorting life, and forming an attack on the Party and socialism.

    Another example is "Basketball Court Turmoil." The "turmoil" was not big in the first place, just a question of whether or not to allow basketball to be played. The basketball game was won, the love affair was successful, and the film ended. However, in order to create contradictions, the author did not hesitate to use all his strength to create a clown - Director Zhang. And in order to highlight this clown, our living environment has also been uglified. The film satirized almost everyone, but the father and daughter of that bourgeois professor were depicted as so enthusiastic and elegant. Fortunately, they "intervened in life" and the "turmoil" was successfully resolved. Isn't the author's tendency obvious? Isn't it clear who the spearhead of satire is directed at?

    "The Search for Love" seems to be satirizing the bourgeois thoughts of Zhang Shilu and Ma Meina. However, the author also made many satires of Li Yong, the so-called positive character, and finally allowed those two swindling young men and women to be combined. "Happiness" is satirizing Wang Jiayou, but his erroneous thoughts were not given a strong criticism; the same is true for "Three Comrades" regarding "Dayangma".

    These examples all illustrate that the directors and writers did not really touch the depths of the ideology, but only to please some backward audiences, excessively pursue the so-called comedic effect, impose many unnecessary gimmicks on the characters, and peddle low-level tastes. Thus, there were many humorous scenes such as people colliding, falling, cakes hitting faces, banana peels sticking to noses, and people falling into mud pits. The author forgot that laughter and satire are only a means, not an end. There was no serious consideration of what to satirize, why to satirize, and how to satirize. It seems that satire can disregard the object and can be free from any constraints.

    Such abuse of satire, only pursuing the so-called comedic effect, not only will inevitably become a pile of bourgeois vulgar and low-level tastes, but also will inevitably one-sidedly exaggerate the dark side and shortcomings of life, and distort the truth of life. Although the political situations of these creators are different, and only one director, Lu Ban, has degenerated into a rightist, from the ideological content of the works, it cannot be said that "Who is the Abandoned One," "Basketball Court Turmoil," etc., are anti-Party and anti-socialist works.

    Negating the leadership of the Party, violating the policies of the Party, canceling or distorting the images of Party members and leaders, and distorting the Party's life and style

    In the 1957 art films, many films intentionally avoided depicting or canceled the images of Party members and the leadership of the Party, and even openly distorted and uglified the images of Party leaders.

    "Footsteps of Youth" is a relatively typical example. The original name of the script was "Education of Life," and it attempted to criticize bourgeois thoughts and feelings and establish communist moral qualities through the degeneration of Meilan. The theme was basically good, although it was not written deeply enough and still had some shortcomings.

    Several major characters in the original literary script, such as Director Gao, the father of Jingwen, was an old cadre and the person in charge of the Party organization of the unit, who had conducted a serious struggle against Peng Ke's mistakes; however, in the film, he became Dean Gao, an old engineer and a democratic person. In the original work, Jingwen was a revolutionary cadre's descendant, a League branch secretary, a Party member, who had criticized Meilan and participated in the struggle against bourgeois design ideas, and later married Xiao Ping; but in the film, she was portrayed as a "big sister" who had no principles and wholeheartedly wanted Xiao Ping to reconcile with Meilan. In the original work, Peng Ke was also a Party member and a demobilized soldier, but he degenerated. In the film, he was also changed to an old engineering staff.

    In short, the director canceled the titles of Party members in the original work, whether they were good Party members or bad Party members. Therefore, it cannot be said that the director was safeguarding the interests of the Party. If a degenerate Party member appeared on the screen, but we also saw the Party organization and other Party members launch a serious struggle against him, what's wrong with that?

    Another example is "Deep Affection." There was originally a Party member deputy director in the script. Although some scenes were not written well enough, she still embodied some of the Party's policy spirit. However, in the film, the scenes of this Party member deputy director were all deleted.

    "Waves of Life" and "Cliff" originally did not see a clear image of a Party member, and the struggle against bourgeois individualism did not see the leadership of the Party. In "Night Voyage in Fog," before the grounding incident occurred, we only saw an acting branch secretary sweating profusely, panicking and begging the captain to stop, but still obeying the captain's erroneous instructions. After the grounding accident occurred, this acting branch secretary "disappeared" from then on.

    In some other films, Party workers and leaders are often outside the struggle. Apart from seeing them say a few empty words, we cannot see any role. Some directors even believe that once Party members directly participate in the struggle, the play will not be able to develop.

    "Happiness," "Nurse's Diary," "Son of a Shepherd," "The Desolate Flute," "Mother and Daughter Teachers," "Riding the Wind and Waves," "Song of the Phoenix," etc., can all see various characters engaged in struggles, but the authors only focus on expressing their personal struggles. The support and strength given to them by the Party organization and leadership is expressed very weakly, and even some incorrect styles and erroneous leadership methods are also expressed as good things. Therefore, the images of Party members and leaders embodied on the screen are pale and weak, lacking vitality, and even simple and rude, with a rigid and unreasonable style.

    This is not an accidental phenomenon. It actually reflects the creative staff's ignorance of the Party's life, and it also reflects their fundamental lack of enthusiasm for expressing the Party's life and struggle.

    We absolutely do not have this simple requirement: no matter what theme and subject matter the film expresses, it must have a Party committee secretary or branch secretary. But it cannot be denied that this is a fact: today, whether in work or in life, whenever major contradictions and conflicts are encountered, especially when issues involving policy and principles are involved, it is simply impossible to get a correct solution without the leadership of the Party. If film art wants to truly reflect life, especially the reality of today's Great Leap Forward, it should not and cannot exclude the images of Party members and leaders from the screen. If we cannot clearly express the image of Party members and exclude Party members from the struggle, it is impossible to express the role and strength of the Party, and especially impossible to correctly embody the Party's fine traditions and leadership style.

    Past facts have also proven that many films have been welcomed and loved by the broad masses precisely because they have created many vivid, lively, and excellent images of communist Party members. From "Daughter of China," "Zhao Yiman," "Iron Warrior," to the recent "Party's Daughter," "Iron Window Flames," and "The Eternal Radio Wave," all just illustrate this point.

    Therefore, using the excuse of opposing formalism and conceptualization, and fancifully wanting to cancel the image of Party members and League members on the screen, is just a deliberate attempt to distort the truth of life, to erase the Party's leading position in the actual struggle, and to oppose the leadership of the Party. Otherwise, why have the images of Party leading cadres appeared in some satirical comedy films? Only in this occasion, in addition to trying to uglify them as much as possible, we cannot see any other purpose.

    Of course, creating excellent images of communist Party members and leaders will always be a difficult task for us. But this is also a historical task that our art creators cannot avoid today.

    Promoting bourgeois viewpoints and ideological emotions, and promoting bourgeois lifestyles

    At the film creation meetings held in Changchun and Shanghai not long ago, some directors and writers revealed a sentiment, saying that they should not describe intellectuals in the future, especially their love, because they will definitely make mistakes if they write about it. This view is obviously wrong. The intellectuals of our era are transforming themselves and changing their bourgeois worldview in the booming socialist revolution and socialist construction, so that they gradually stand on the position of the proletariat and establish the worldview of the working class. If some films correctly express the process of intellectuals' transformation, growth, and becoming new-type intellectuals who are combined with workers and peasants, to educate young people, isn't this exactly what we need? Secondly, the occurrence of errors is not in the description of love. There is of course love in young people's lives, but it is not the only important thing in life. If love is correctly expressed, and this love encourages people to move upward and improve the communist moral qualities of young people, what is wrong with describing it?

    We have reflected very little on subjects related to the lives of intellectuals in the past, and now we need to appropriately reflect this aspect of subjects, especially the subjects of the lives of young intellectuals. The key is what to reflect and how to reflect it.

    However, some films about intellectuals produced last year, such as "Deep Affection," "Footsteps of Youth," "Cliff," "Riding the Wind and Waves," "Nurse's Diary," "Retest," "Waves of Life," and "Shanghai Girl," almost have a common tendency, that is, to try every possible means to resurrect and express and promote petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideological emotions.

    These films, on the surface, all seem to be planning to criticize certain things. "Deep Affection" seems to be criticizing the conservative thinking of senior intellectuals; "Footsteps of Youth" and "Cliff" both seem to be criticizing the bourgeois thinking of the two heroines; "Waves of Life" seems to be criticizing individualism. But all of these, in essence, are defending bourgeois ideology in the name of false criticism, and even promoting and beautifying petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideological emotions.

    The creators are full of sympathy and preference for Huang Weiwen, Jin Zhang, Meilan, and Fang Qing, who should be criticized, and try their best to defend these people. For example, in "Footsteps of Youth," in the original unrevised film, not only was there no criticism of Meilan, but it seemed that the people around her had done things that were sorry for her. The director's most proud and most exciting scene was when Peng Ke returned from the court, and when his mother wanted to go up to blame him, she was stopped by his wife Shufang, and then his wife prepared dinner for him with tears in her eyes. The entire film did not conduct any struggle against Peng Ke, only a few people "glared" at him, making a "silent condemnation" gesture. The tone of the film is low and gloomy, trying to render Meilan's personal contradictions, pain, pessimism, and disappointment after "stumbling," in order to win the audience's sympathy. The director and actors' creation of this role is actually an attitude of appreciation, completely immersed in the sea of petty-bourgeois ideological emotions. No wonder some comrades criticized that after watching this kind of film, they could not help but feel that they had returned to the era of thirty years ago.

    "Deep Affection" compared to "Footsteps of Youth" and "Cliff," the bourgeois viewpoints and ideological emotions are not so obvious, but the more hidden the poison is, the deeper it is. This film is precisely targeting and opposing the Party's policy on intellectuals.

    The Party's policy on intellectuals is to transform them with proletarian ideology through the principles of unity, education, and transformation. But this film essentially promotes bourgeois super-class and super-political viewpoints: friendship can transcend everything. The friendship expressed in the film is to be humble and accommodating to the scientist who is full of pro-American views and unwilling to transform himself, without criticizing and leading him. It seems that only in this way can senior intellectuals be moved and united.

    However, the bourgeois "affection" and feudal "friendship" promoted in "Deep Affection" are precisely the dregs that we want to burn. Intellectuals are already facing a new historical period. Either be a "gentleman on the beam," retaining the stinky shelf of individualism and not combining with the working people; or completely abandon the bourgeois worldview, surrender to the proletariat, transform themselves, and serve the people. At this moment when the struggle between the two roads of intellectuals is very sharp, it is not difficult to imagine who this film has "affection" for.

    Among the films reflecting the subject of intellectuals' lives, there is another type of film, which expresses the willingness of new-type young intellectuals to devote themselves to construction projects to train and transform themselves, such as "Riding the Wind and Waves," "Nurse's Diary," and "Shanghai Girl." But these films sometimes over-beautify intellectuals, and even in order to beautify and highlight the image of intellectuals, they do not hesitate to exaggerate the role of intellectuals and distort the images of workers and the Party's leadership.

    For example, the film "Shanghai Girl" portrays a Shanghai girl, Bai Mei, as being above everything else. In the entire construction of the construction site, only she attaches importance to the quality of the project, adheres to principles, and dares to struggle, becoming the only correct character; and the Party and administrative leaders are all bureaucrats. As a result, a Shanghai girl is formed in isolation to transform the world.

    In short, these films are nothing more than reflecting the transformation problems of various intellectuals. However, the author does not stand on the position of the proletariat, and does not measure the intellectuals in the process of transformation with communist ideas and moral qualities, and guide them to truly combine with the workers and peasants. On the contrary, these films not only fail to express the strength and role of the Party and the masses, but instead sing praises of various individual struggles, and attribute the driving force of progress to love and friendship, and even the pain, contradictions, and mistakes of individualists.

    These films stubbornly express various forms of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts and viewpoints, promote bourgeois so-called human nature theory, ethics and morality, love supremacy, friendship first, sentimentalism, talent theory, human touch, etc., and even tolerate, sympathize with, and even favor and appreciate the shortcomings and errors of intellectuals. Therefore, these films are called criticizing individualism, but in fact they appreciate individualism.

    These films also greatly promote bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological emotions and lifestyles. They render the pain and contradictions of individualists, and appreciate the decadent, resentful, melancholy, and sad mood. Among them, Western suits and fancy clothes are popular, the sets are magnificent, and yellow songs and yellow shots also appear. Seriously, these bourgeois ideological emotions are not only rampant in these films depicting the lives of intellectuals, but even rampant in films expressing the lives of ethnic minorities and rural lives. The original theme of "Lusheng Love Song" was an extremely sharp class struggle, but now it has become a "Tarzan of the Apes" style film of "love supremacy." "Flowers Bloom and Moon is Full," adapted from Zhao Shuli's original work "Sanliwan," is indeed a well-deserved "Flowers Bloom and Moon is Full." In addition to highlighting and exaggerating the love of three pairs of young people, the main line of the struggle between the two roads has been removed. Not to mention a film like "Sleepless City," which is a bourgeois hymn. The promotion of the bourgeois lifestyle is simply exhaustive!

    I think, judging from the erroneous ideological tendencies of the bourgeois in some art films produced in 1957 and the first half of 1958, they are mainly manifested in the above aspects. I cannot make a specific analysis of each film. For some other films, the general descriptions are not real enough, the reflection of realistic themes is not typical enough, and the distortion of life and other phenomena will not be discussed. These important erroneous tendencies alone are enough for us to receive painful lessons.

    Thoroughly Sweep Away the Influence of Revisionist Thoughts, Strengthen the Leadership of the Party, Continue to Implement the Policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, and Establish a Film Team that is Both Red and Expert

    Last year, a considerable number of films had errors that were universal and common. Although the forms of expression are different, the essence is the wavering and betrayal of the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, all the way to openly waving white flags to attack the Party and oppose the leadership of the Party.

    In 1957, among many film creators, worker-peasant-soldier themes were no longer popular, the Party spirit principle of literature and art was no longer mentioned, and the requirement to create new heroic figures was abandoned. Guo Wei, a director who was educated and grown up by the Party in the war and who had achieved certain achievements in shooting revolutionary war themes but degenerated into a rightist, openly declared: "I will no longer be a war monger, and I will no longer shoot war themes." The rightist Lu Ban said, "We can rely on Yin Xiuzhen and Han Langen for a lifetime." Someone shouted, "We must boldly write about pain, write about feelings, write about love, and write about the truth"; someone announced that "the director is the commander of the three armies" and wants to "rule the factory by director"... Aren't these many fallacies responding to Zhong Dianfei's call for "regression"?

    Therefore, the erroneous ideological tendencies in the creation of certain films in 1957 are very clear. This is the reflection of the class struggle in the socialist revolution period on the film front. This is a sharp battle for positions, and it is a struggle between two roads in film art.

    Naturally, there are many reasons for the emergence of these films.

    From the perspective of the leadership of the Film Bureau, although we emphasized the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and emphasized the creation of new heroic figures, etc., we just relaxed the most fundamental point, and did not often take effective measures to urge and help creative personnel to go deep into life and to train and transform themselves. At the same time, we also did not realize that we should resolutely hand over the film studio, such an important and complex career, to the direct leadership of the local Party committees and Party organizations, and obtain the direct concern and specific supervision of the local Parties.

    The leaders of the Film Bureau and the film studios lacked a deep understanding and understanding of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. We initially emphasized the characteristics of the film, fearing "releasing," fearing that it would be difficult to lead, fearing that poisonous weeds would be released, and fearing that centralized management would be abandoned. Later, when implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, we abandoned ideological leadership and ideological struggle. Later, when some bad films came out, we were afraid of criticism, afraid of weeding out poisonous weeds, and did not dare to face the seriousness of the errors. In short, a word of fear runs through the three stages, which is essentially right-leaning thinking, a manifestation of not believing in the truth, not believing in the leadership of the Party, and not believing in the masses.

    Regarding the issue of the film art creation team. It should first be affirmed that this team is strong, can withstand the test, and its work has achieved results. However, in the past, because we did not resolutely take the road of being both red and expert, we superstitious in a few experts, worshiped authority, and did not adhere to the policy of going to the countryside and going up the mountains for training and transformation, so in the process of the era's leap forward, it was impossible to adapt to the needs of the era. Moreover, according to the needs of the current booming development of the film industry, this team is obviously too small, and needs to be well rectified, adjusted, transformed, and expanded, and greatly increase new blood.

    At the same time, a noteworthy fact is placed in front of us, that is, the bourgeois worldview and lifestyle, as well as artistic viewpoints and artistic tastes, still bind and dominate some of our artists. If this situation is not changed, film creation will not be able to leap forward. This requires a series of tasks on the theoretical front to systematically and thoroughly criticize the various forms of bourgeois thought and revisionist tendencies in film art creation in a planned way. While resolutely criticizing revisionism, we cannot relax the criticism of dogmatism and prevent the rise of dogmatism.

    In short, without these conditions and climate, revisionist evil winds could not be so rampant. To thoroughly sweep away the influence of revisionist thoughts, we must start from the above three aspects, from the root, that is, strengthen the leadership of the Party, continue to implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, thoroughly transform the team, and establish a team that is both red and expert.

    In the socialist revolution and construction, our struggle against bourgeois thought and the influence of revisionist thought is long-term. In the future, they will invade us more covertly and cleverly. Therefore, their criticism must be resolutely carried out to the end. It is very beneficial to expose the errors in the creation of film art films in 1957. This can turn bad things into good things. Because, when the white flag is erected, it is easier for us to identify the direction, understand the enemy's situation, understand that our position is not yet consolidated, and that we still need to plant the red flag there, and actively work and participate in the struggle.

    However, some comrades do not think this way, or hope to ban the performance of these bad films, or are unwilling to launch a severe criticism head-on. If this is done, it is really of no benefit. We should follow the instructions of the Party, face up to this serious error, and dare to make great breaks and great establishments, so that film art creators can seriously learn lessons.

    I am responsible for the leadership of art film production in the Film Bureau, and I have produced so many bad films. I must bear great responsibility, and I should also deeply examine my right-leaning thinking in implementing the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. However, since the film has been produced and has become a social product and has had an impact, it cannot be simply regarded as a personal problem. We should consider the problem from the perspective of the Party's policy, how to actively weed out and make it into fertilizer, so that it is more conducive to the development of the cause.

    Since May of this year, the Party's leadership has instructed film artists to shoot more documentaries to record the era of the Great Leap Forward, and at the same time, to devote themselves to the era of the Great Leap Forward to transform themselves. In less than half a year, there have been significant achievements. In particular, the Party put forward the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, which further encourages us to forge ahead with confidence.

    Let us all work together to resolutely pull out the white flags on the screen! Let the red flags fly on the screen one after another, more brightly than the other! We believe that with the joint collaboration and efforts of all film artists, film art will definitely create better results to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    坚决拔掉银幕上的白旗
    ——1957年电影艺术片中错误思想倾向的批判
    陈荒煤
    1957年的春天，钟惦棐把反党的电影的锣鼓敲响之后，右派分子向党的电影事业进行了疯狂的进攻。他们集中目标攻击党对电影工作的领导，极力歪曲和诬蔑党的文艺政策，反对电影为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务，主张倒退，企图把电影事业拉回资本主义的道路。
    右派分子的进攻，遭到电影艺术工作者的坚决回击。在党的领导下，电影界在斗争中获得了伟大的胜利。
    在紧张的反右斗争中，艺术片的生产仍然超额完成任务。反映工农兵题材的影片也还是多数；无论内容、形式和风格方面都比较多样，看得出来，许多人都在努力探索新的表现方法。去年拍摄的一些较好的影片，如“海魂”“边寨烽火”“女篮五号”“五更寒”等，在今年4月新片展览时，得到广大群众的欢迎。
    这证明了，电影方面为了贯彻党的百花齐放、百家争鸣政策而采取的一些措施：加强制片厂的责任，直接负责文学剧本到影片完成的艺术领导、审查、批准，鼓励创作人员的创作集体的活动，发扬创作人员的积极性与创造性，基本上是正确的。
    但是，由于电影艺术创作者绝大部分都是资产阶级知识分子，他们原来的立场观点还没有彻底改变，因此，在他们的作品里，时常表现出资产阶级的思想感情和趣味。几年来，在党的领导下，电影界对一些具有严重错误思想的影片进行了批判，使广大电影创作人员受到了教育。1951年对电影“武训传”的批判这一场严重的思想斗争，就是一个例子。不过问题并没有得到彻底解决，那个灵魂深处的资产阶级王国并没有完全摧毁，在国内外修正主义思想影响下，这些渣滓又浮了上来。
    已经放映的一部分艺术片，如“情长谊深”“球场风波”“寻爱记”“青春的脚步”“雾海夜航”等，受到了广大观众的严正批评。也还有一部分影片，拍摄完毕后还需要作修改或者根本不能放映，如“未完成的喜剧”“谁是被抛弃的人”“不夜城”等。除了一些直接攻击党、攻击新社会的毒草外，有许多影片在不同程度上暴露了资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想情绪、观点和趣味；甚至个别较好的影片也掺杂有这些东西。
    为了拔掉银幕上的白旗，插上红旗，为了电影创作的大跃进（电影创作的跃进，首先决定于创作工作者思想的跃进），特别是为了使明年创作提高一步，对1957年艺术创作中的主要的错误倾向加以批判，是十分需要的。
    主要的错误倾向是什么呢？
    滥用讽刺，借口“反映真实”、“干预生活”，直接攻击党和新社会，反对党的领导
    1957年的影片中，讽刺喜剧特别流行。除了那部彻头彻尾反党、反社会主义的、庸俗不堪的“未完成的喜剧”外，有“球场风波”
  “寻爱记”“三个战友”“幸福”，以及原来文学剧本采取讽刺喜剧样式的“谁是被抛弃的人”“探亲记”等等。
    首先应该说明，我们是需要运用讽刺喜剧的样式来批评我们生活中的一些不良现象，揭发生活中新旧的矛盾与冲突的。讽刺喜剧应该成为批评人民群众中的缺点和错误的武器。重要的问题是作者站在什么立场来讽刺和批评。
    “未完成的喜剧”的作者的立场和态度是很鲜明的，就是直接攻击党的领导，攻击新社会。所以，尽管它是恶毒的，但是却一目了然。
    还有一些问题严重而表现得较隐晦的影片。它们借口“反映真实”、“干预生活”，实质上却歪曲了劳动人民的形象和生活，形成对新社会的攻击和反对党的领导。
    比如“谁是被抛弃的人”，作者原来企图是鞭挞一个入城以来蜕化变质的老干部。如果能够深刻地揭露这种思想的本质，能够充分表现我们时代的社会环境和组织的力量，尽管这种题材带有一定的局限性，是一种个别的现象，也不是不可以表现的。
    可是，这部影片却完全歪曲了我们的生活环境：于树德这个在新社会为非作恶的坏人，简直如入“无人之境”。影片根本没有表现党和群众对他的斗争。它给人的印象只是：老党员、老干部进了城，当了领导，就都变质了。这是对党的攻击和污蔑。而通过人物形象，通过所渲染的城市的物质生活，把城市和乡村、干部和群众夸大地歪曲地对立起来。同样的观点，也反映在“探亲记”这个剧本里。这两部影片尽管都没有按原剧本拍摄（“探亲记”的主题已经作了根本改变），然而却有着一个共同倾向：站在反动的立场，滥用讽刺，夸大生活中个别现象，歪曲生活，形成对党对社会主义的攻击。
    再如“球场风波”。“风波”本来不大，不过是一个让不让打篮球的问题。篮球打赢了，恋爱成功了，影片也就完了。可是作者为了制造矛盾，却不惜用一切力量来创造一个丑角——张主任。并且为了突出这个丑角，把我们的生活环境也加以丑化了。影片几乎讽刺了所有的人，唯独那一对资产阶级教授父女却被描写成那样热心积极，温文尔雅。幸亏他们“干预生活”，“风波”才得圆满解决。作者的倾向性难道还不明显？讽刺的锋芒向着谁，难道还不明白么？
      “寻爱记”似乎是在讽刺张士禄和马美娜的资产阶级思想。然而作者对李勇这个所谓正面人物也作了许多讽刺，并且最后还让那两个招摇撞骗的青年男女结合在一起。“幸福”是讽刺王家有的，可是，对他的错误思想并没有给予有力的批判；“三个战友”对于“大洋马”也是如此。
    这些例子都说明了：编导并没有真正去接触思想深处的东西，只是为了取悦于部分落后观众，过多地追求所谓喜剧的效果，强加于人物身上许多不必要的噱头，卖弄低级趣味。于是，出现了许多撞人、摔跤、蛋糕打在脸上、香蕉皮沾在鼻尖上、人掉在泥坑里等等逗笑的镜头。作者忘记了笑和讽刺只是一种手段，而不是目的。没有认真考虑讽刺什么，为什么讽刺，如何讽刺。好像讽刺可以不管对象，可以不受任何约束一样。
    这样滥用讽刺，只追求所谓喜剧效果，其结果，不但必然会成为资产阶级的庸俗低级趣味的堆砌，也必然会片面地夸大生活中的阴暗面和缺点，歪曲生活的真实。尽管这些创作者的政治情况有所不同，其中只有一个编导吕班堕落成了右派分子，但是，从作品的思想内容来看，不能不说“谁是被抛弃的人”“球场风波”等，都是反党、反社会主义的作品。
    抹杀党的领导，违反党的政策，取消或歪曲党员及领导人物的形象，歪曲党的生活和作风
    1957年的艺术片中，有好些影片有意回避描写或取消党员和党的领导的形象，甚至公然对党的领导人物形象加以歪曲、丑化。
    “青春的脚步”是一个比较典型的例子。剧本原名“生活的教育”，是企图通过美兰的堕落来批判资产阶级思想情感，树立共产主义道德品质的。主题基本上是好的，尽管写得还不够深刻，还有些缺点。
    原来文学剧本中的几个主要人物，比如静文的父亲高主任，是一个老干部，是本单位党组织的负责人，曾经对彭珂的错误进行了严肃的斗争；可是，影片中却变为一个高院长，是个老工程师、民主人士。原作中静文是一个革命干部后代，团支书，党员，曾对美兰进行过批评，参与了对资产阶级设计思想的斗争，后来与萧平结合在一起；而影片又把她表现为一个毫无原则的、一心一意要萧平与美兰和好的“大姐”。原作中彭珂也是一个党员、转业军人，但是蜕化变质了。影片中也改为一个旧工程人员。
    总之，导演把原作中党员的称号都取消了，不论是好党员或坏党员。所以，这丝毫也不能说，导演是在维护党的利益。如果在银幕上出现了一个蜕化变质的党员，但也让我们看到党的组织和其他党员对他展开了严肃的斗争，这又有什么不好呢？
    再如“情长谊深”，原来剧本中有一个党员副所长。尽管有些戏写得不够好，但从她身上多少还体现出来一些党的政策精神。可是影片中把这个党员副所长的戏全部删掉了。
    “生活的浪花”和“悬崖”，原来也都看不到一个鲜明的党员形象，对资产阶级个人主义的斗争，也都看不到党的领导。“雾海夜航”在发生触礁事件前，我们只看到一个代理支部书记满头大汗，惊慌失措地恳求船长停车，但是仍然服从了船长错误的指示。等到触礁事故发生之后，这位代理支书就从此“失踪”了。
    在另外的一些影片中，党的工作人员、领导人员往往也是置身于斗争之外的，除了看见他们说几句空话之外，看不到什么作用。有的导演甚至认为：一出现党员直接参与斗争，戏就发展不下去了。
    “幸福”“护士日记”“牧人之子”“洞箫横吹”“母女教师”“乘风破浪”“凤凰之歌”等等，都可以看到各种各样的人物在进行斗争，可是，作者只着重表现了他们个人的斗争，对党的组织和领导所给予他们的支持和力量，却表现得非常微弱，甚至把一些不正确的作风和错误的领导方法，也当作好的东西来表现，因而，体现在银幕上的党员和领导人员的形象，就苍白无力，缺乏生气，甚至简单粗暴，作风生硬，不近情理。
    这不是一个偶然的现象，这实际上反映了创作人员对党的生活的无知，也反映了他们对表现党的生活和斗争根本缺乏热情。
    我们绝没有这种简单的要求：无论表现什么主题和题材的影片，都一定硬要加上一个党委书记或支部书记。但不能不承认这是事实：今天不论是在工作、生活中，凡是遇到重大的矛盾和冲突，特别是涉及到政策性、原则性的问题，离开了党的领导，就根本不可能得到正确的解决。电影艺术要真实地反映生活，特别是反映今天大跃进的现实，就不应该、也不可能把党员和领导人物的形象从银幕上排挤出去。如果不能鲜明地表现党员的形象，把党员排斥在斗争之外，就不可能表现党的作用和力量，尤其不可能正确地体现党的优良传统和领导作风。
    过去的事实也证明，许多影片之所以获得广大群众的欢迎和热爱，正是因为创造了许多鲜明的、生动的、优秀的共产党员的形象。从“中华女儿”“赵一曼”“钢铁战士”，到最近的“党的女儿”“铁窗烈火”“永不消逝的电波”，都正好说明这一点。
    所以，借口反对公式主义和概念化，异想天开地要在银幕上取消党团员的形象，这不过是故意要歪曲生活的真实，企图抹杀党在现实斗争中的领导地位，反对党的领导而已。不然的话，为什么有些讽刺喜剧影片中却又出现了党的领导干部形象呢？只是在这种场合，除了尽力将他们丑化以外，看不出有其它目的。
    当然，创造优秀的共产党员的以及领导的形象，对我们来讲，永远是一个艰巨的任务。但是，这也是我们今天艺术创作者无法回避的一个历史任务。
    宣扬资产阶级的观点和思想情感，宣扬资产阶级生活方式
    不久前在长春和上海举行的电影创作会议上，有些编导流露了一种情绪，说以后不要再去描写知识分子了，尤其是不能描写他们的爱情，写了就一定会犯错误。这种看法显然是错误的。我们这个时代的知识分子，正在轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中改造自己，改变自己资产阶级的世界观，使自己逐步站到无产阶级的立场上来，建立工人阶级的世界观。如果有些影片，正确地去表现知识分子的改造、成长、成为与工农相结合的新型知识分子的过程，来教育青年，这不正是我们所需要的么？其次，错误的发生，也不在于描写了爱情。青年生活中当然有爱情，但这不是生活中唯一重要的东西。如果正确地表现爱情，这种爱情是鼓舞人向上、提高青年共产主义道德品质的，这又有什么不可以描写呢？
    我们过去对于有关知识分子生活的题材反映得很少，现在需要适当地反映这方面的题材，特别是青年知识分子生活的题材，这是没有问题的。关键在于反映什么，如何反映。
    但去年摄制的一些有关知识分子题材的影片，如“情长谊深”“青春的脚步”“悬崖”“乘风破浪”“护士日记”“复试”“生活的浪花”“上海姑娘”等，几乎有一种共同的倾向，就是千方百计，借尸还魂地来表现、宣扬小资产阶级、资产阶级的思想情感。
    这些影片从表面看起来，都好像是打算要批判某些东西。“情长谊深”好像是要批判高级知识分子的保守思想；“青春的脚步”和“悬崖”都似乎要批判两个女主角的资产阶级思想；“生活的浪花”似乎在批判个人主义。但所有这些，实质上都是假批判之名，而为资产阶级的思想辩护，甚至宣扬、美化小资产阶级和资产阶级的思想感情。
    创作者对黄慰文、金章、美兰、方晴这些应该批判的人物充满了同情与偏爱，极力为这些人辩解。比如“青春的脚步”，原来未修改前的影片中，不但看不到对美兰有任何批判，倒好像周围的人都作了对不起她的事情。导演最得意、认为最激动人心的一场戏，是彭珂从法院回来，他母亲要上去责备他的时候，被他的妻子淑芳阻拦住，随后他的妻子含着泪为他准备晚餐。整个影片对彭珂没有进行任何斗争，只有几个群众对他“怒目而视”，作出“无言的谴责”姿态。影片的调子是低沉的、阴暗的，极力渲染美兰“失足”后的个人的矛盾痛苦、悲观失望，以博得观众的同情。导演与演员对这个角色的创造实际上是一种欣赏的态度，完全沉醉于小资产阶级的思想情感大海里了。无怪乎有些同志批评，看了这种影片，不禁感觉又回到三十年前的时代去了。
    “情长谊深”比起“青春的脚步”“悬崖”来，资产阶级的观点、思想情感并不是那么显露，然而愈隐蔽则毒素更深。这部影片正是针锋相对地反对党的知识分子政策的。
    党对知识分子的政策，是通过团结、教育、改造的方针，以无产阶级的思想来改造他们。而这部影片实质上是宣扬资产阶级的超阶级、超政治的观点：友谊可以超越一切。影片所表现的友谊，就是要对那位充满崇美观点、不愿改造自己的科学家低声下气，百般容忍迁就，不进行批评和领导，好像唯有如此才能感动、团结高级知识分子。
    可是，“情长谊深”所宣扬的这种资产阶级的“情”，封建社会的“谊”，正是要被我们焚毁的渣滓。知识分子已经面临着一个新的历史时期。要末就作“梁上君子”，保留个人主义的臭架子，不和劳动人民相结合；要末就彻底抛弃资产阶级的世界观，投降无产阶级，改造自己，为人民服务。正是知识分子两条道路的斗争十分尖锐的时刻，这部影片到底对谁有“情谊”也就不难想见了。
    在反映知识分子生活题材的影片中，还有另一种类型的影片，就是表现新型青年知识分子愿意投身到建设工程中去锻炼自己、改造自己的，例如“乘风破浪”“护士日记”“上海姑娘”等。但是这类影片有时却过于美化知识分子，甚至为了美化、突出知识分子的形象，而不惜夸大知识分子的作用，歪曲工人群众和党的领导形象。
    比如，“上海姑娘”这部影片，就把一个上海姑娘白玫表现得高于一切。在整个工地建设中，唯有她重视工程的质量，坚持原则，敢于斗争，成为唯一正确的人物；而党和行政的领导却都是一些官僚主义者。结果，便形成这么一个上海姑娘孤立地在改造世界。
    总之，这些影片都无非是反映各种各样知识分子的改造问题。然而，作者不是站在无产阶级的立场，以共产主义思想、道德品质来衡量在改造过程中的知识分子，引导他们真正和工农群众相结合。相反，这些影片，不但没有能够表现党和群众的力量与作用，却在歌颂各种各样的个人奋斗，把前进的动力归结为爱情和友谊，甚至是个人主义者的痛苦、矛盾和错误。
    这些影片顽强地表现了各种形形色色资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想和观点，宣扬资产阶级的所谓人性论、伦理道德、爱情至上、友谊第一、温情主义、天才论、人情味等等，连知识分子的缺点和错误都加以容忍、同情、甚至偏爱、欣赏。所以，这些影片名曰批判个人主义，实则欣赏个人主义。
    这些影片也大大宣扬了资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想情感和生活方式。对个人主义者的痛苦和矛盾加以渲染，欣赏那种颓废、哀怨、忧悒、悲伤的情调。其中西装花衣服流行，布景则要富丽堂皇，黄色歌曲和黄色镜头也出现了。严重的是，这些资产阶级的思想情感，不但在这些描写知识分子生活的影片中泛滥着，甚至在表现少数民族生活和农村生活的影片中也泛滥着。“芦笙恋歌”原来的主题是极其尖锐的阶级斗争，但现在却成了“恋爱至上”的“人猿泰山”式的影片。根据赵树理原作“三里湾”改编的“花好月圆”，倒是名副其实的“花好月圆”，除了突出、夸大了三对青年的恋爱外，把两条道路的斗争这条主线抽掉了。更不用说像“不夜城”这样一部资产阶级的赞歌的影片。对资产阶级的生活方式的宣扬简直是淋漓尽致！
    我想，就1957年和1958年上半年出产的某些艺术片来看资产阶级的错误思想倾向，主要是表现在以上的几个方面。我不可能对每一部影片进行具体分析。对于另外的一些影片，一般的描写不够真实，反映现实题材的不够典型，歪曲生活等等的现象也不去讲它了，仅仅就这些重要的错误倾向，已经足够使我们得到沉痛的教训了。
    彻底扫清修正主义思想影响，加强党的领导，继续贯彻百花齐放的方针，建立又红又专的电影队伍
    去年有相当数量的影片，其错误是带有普遍性和共同性的。尽管表现形态各不相同，实质上就是对文艺为工农兵方向的动摇和叛变，一直到公开摇着白旗向党进攻，反对党的领导。
    1957年在许多电影创作人员中，工农兵题材吃不开了，文艺的党性原则不再提了，创造新英雄人物的要求放弃了。在战争中被党教育成长起来的、拍摄了革命战争题材而获得一定成就却堕落为右派分子的导演郭维公然宣称：“再不当战争贩子，再不拍摄战争题材了。”右派分子吕班说“就靠殷秀岑和韩兰根这两人可以吃一辈子。”有人叫喊着“要大胆写痛苦、写感情、写恋爱、写真实”；有人宣布“导演是三军统帅”要“导演治厂”……这许许多多的谬论，难道不正是响应了钟惦棐的“倒退”的号召么？
    所以，1957年某些影片创作中的错误思想倾向是十分鲜明的。这就是社会主义革命时期的阶级斗争在电影阵地上的反映，这是一场尖锐的阵地争夺战，是电影艺术方面两条道路的斗争。
    自然，这些影片的产生，原因是多方面的。
    从电影局领导方面来讲，尽管我们强调工农兵的方向，强调创造新英雄人物等等，但是恰恰放松了最根本的一条，没有经常采取有效措施督促，帮助创作人员深入生活，锻炼改造。同时，也没有认识到，应该坚决把电影制片厂这样一个重要的、错综复杂的事业交给各地党委、党组织的直接领导，取得各地党的直接关心和具体监督。
    电影局和制片厂的领导对党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，缺乏深刻的认识和理解。我们开始是强调电影的特性，怕“放”，怕不好领导，怕放出毒草来，怕放弃集中管理。以后贯彻百花齐放的方针时，又放弃了思想领导和思想斗争。到后来，出了一些坏影片，又怕批评，怕锄毒草，不敢正视错误的严重性。总之，一个怕字贯串三个阶段，实质上是右倾思想，是不相信真理、不相信党的领导、不相信群众的一种表现。
    关于电影艺术创作的队伍问题。应该首先肯定，这支队伍是有力量的，经得起考验的，工作是有成绩的。然而过去由于没有坚决走又红又专的道路，迷信少数专家，崇拜权威，不坚持下乡上山的锻炼改造方针，因此在时代飞跃前进的过程中，就不可能适应时代的需要。而且，根据现在电影事业蓬勃发展的需要来看，这支队伍显然太小了，需要很好整顿、调整、改造和扩大，大大增加新的血液。
    同时，一个值得注意的事实摆在面前，那就是资产阶级的世界观与生活情调，以及艺术观点、艺术趣味，至今还束缚着、支配着我们某些艺术家。这种状况不改变，电影创作是无法跃进的。这要求理论战线上一系列的工作，有计划地、系统地、彻底地批判电影艺术创作中的、形形色色的资产阶级思想和修正主义倾向。在坚决批判修正主义的同时，也不能放松对教条主义的批评，防止教条主义的抬头。
    总之，没有这些条件和气候，修正主义的歪风不可能如此猖狂。要彻底扫清修正主义思潮的影响，必须从以上三个方面，从根本着手，即加强党的领导，继续贯彻百花齐放的方针，彻底改造队伍，建立又红又专的队伍。
    在社会主义革命和建设中，我们对资产阶级的思想及修正主义思想影响的斗争，是长期的。今后它们会更隐蔽、更巧妙地来侵袭我们。因而，对它们的批判是必须坚决进行到底的。把1957年电影艺术片创作中的错误加以暴露，是有很大好处的。这就能把坏事变成好事。因为，白旗树立起来，更便于我们辨别方向、了解敌情，明了我们的阵地还不巩固，那里还需要插上红旗，而积极工作，参与斗争。
    但是，也有些同志不这样想，或者希望禁止演出这些坏影片，或者不愿意去正面展开严厉的批评。这样作，倒真是没有什么好处。我们应该按照党的指示，正视这种严重的错误，要敢于大破大立，使电影艺术创作工作者认真地吸取教训。
    我在电影局负责艺术片生产的领导工作，产生了这样多不好的影片，我要负很大的责任，也应该对自己执行党的百花齐放、百家争鸣政策的右倾思想，进行深刻检查。但是影片既然产生，已经成了社会产品，发生了影响，那么，就不能仅仅看作是个人的问题了，应该从党的政策来考虑问题，如何积极来锄草，使其变为肥料，更有利于事业的发展。
    从今年5月起，党的领导方面指示电影艺术工作者要多拍摄些纪录片，纪录大跃进的时代，同时，投身到大跃进时代去改造自己，为时不到半年，已经有了显著的成绩。尤其是党提出了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，更加鼓舞我们满怀信心地奋勇前进。
    让我们大家一齐动手，坚决拔掉银幕上的白旗吧！让红旗一面紧接着一面，一面比一面更鲜明地在银幕上飞扬吧！我们相信在全体电影艺术工作者共同的协作和努力下，电影艺术一定能创造出更好的成绩来迎接国庆十周年。
