To enable all people to engage in atomic energy and to allow the atomic energy industry to blossom all over the motherland, we used "native" methods during the Great Leap Forward in Science to create a "static accelerator" for atomic energy research.

There were six of us working together on the research and production, four of whom were women comrades. At first, the work progressed slowly. I thought there must be ideological problems at play here. So, I called a group meeting. I took the lead in exposing my thoughts at the meeting, and everyone also talked about their views. Some said, "Others are working on advanced things at the international level. There's not much point in us doing something native." Based on these thoughts, we held another group meeting. The Party Branch Secretary and the head of the teaching and research section personally attended. Through discussion, everyone clarified the great significance of the central government's "combining native and foreign methods" policy. It became clear that we not only wanted to make a "native" accelerator, but also promote this "native" accelerator. This would further implement the Party's mass line, greatly dispel people's superstition towards the cutting-edge science of atomic energy, and bring it directly to the masses, allowing it to be mastered by the masses.

In the manufacturing process, we encountered many difficulties. The first difficulty was making the accelerating electrode. This kind of accelerating electrode could not be bought on the market. At first, we asked our own metal factory to process it, but they said it might not meet the specifications. So, we went to find craftsmen in the city, but they also said they couldn't make it. We then thought of using substitutes, searching for suitable items among various commodities in the streets and alleys. Later, we accidentally discovered that a kind of aluminum dish, similar in size and shape to what we needed, and also cheap, so we bought two. After we processed them, the test results showed they performed well. Moreover, these vegetable dishes can also be bought in small cities and rural cooperatives, so communes don't need to worry about making this kind of accelerator.

The second difficulty was finding insulating materials. We first bought porcelain cups and earthenware cups for testing, and then found some glass cups, fire bricks, tiles, beer bottles, and so on, a total of more than ten kinds of materials. The test results were not satisfactory. At that time, more than half of the people were not very confident. At this time, the organization pointed out to us again that we must insist on implementing the "combining native and foreign methods" policy and not waver. And encouraged us to overcome difficulties and continue to work hard. This further strengthened our determination to continue to find "native" materials. Finally, we found a porcelain insulating material that met the requirements and was also cheap.

The third difficulty was making an important component of the native accelerator - the high-voltage electrode. In foreign countries, high-voltage electrodes are made of copper, which is too expensive and hard to get. Someone suggested using thin aluminum plates, but the thickness of this aluminum plate had to be only three millimeters to meet the requirements. At this time, some "experts" advised us, "I'm afraid you won't succeed in doing this. Others have failed. Thin aluminum plates are easily broken, and even if they don't break, they won't meet the requirements for smoothness." We thought we'd try it and see what happens. If it doesn't work, we'll think of another way. A young worker from our factory, Comrade Zhang Baowen, volunteered to take on this work. He dug a pit in the ground, laid the aluminum plate on it, and carefully hammered it with a wooden hammer, bit by bit. After hammering for a while, he picked it up and dug the hole deeper before hammering again. He worked continuously for forty hours, and finally made it. The test results showed it performed very well.

With these problems solved, our work progressed quickly. We proposed to make a gift for the Party Congress before August 28. On the 26th, half of our processed materials had not yet been started. The task was urgent, and every second counted. The Party Branch called on all comrades in the department to support our work. That night, people were really excited and enthusiastic. The whole department was like celebrating a holiday. Wherever there was a need for strength, there was someone there. Teachers, students, workers, guards, and full-time Party and League cadres were all mobilized.

At 2:00 p.m. on August 28, the first "native" accelerator in our country, completely designed, manufactured, and installed by ourselves, finally met with all the representatives of the Third Party Congress of our school after twenty-eight days of intense work! This "native" accelerator is estimated to be worth about 3,000 yuan, while each "foreign" accelerator costs at least 40,000 or 50,000 yuan. Our "native" accelerator is not only cheap, but its level is also not behind that of the foreign ones. We believe this is a great victory for the Party's policy of "combining native and foreign methods" and following the mass line in running science!

    我们制成“土”静电加速器
    北京大学物理教研室助教  沈能学
    为了全民办原子能，使原子能事业在祖国遍地开花，我们在科学大跃进中，用“土”办法制成了研究原子能用的“静电加速器”。
    我们一共有六个人共同研究制作，六人中，四个是女同志。开始时，工作进度很慢，我想这里一定有思想问题在作怪。我就召开小组会。我在会上带头暴露思想，大家也谈了自己的看法。有的说：“别人都在搞国际水平的高级东西，我们搞个土的没啥意思。”根据这些思想，我们又开了小组会，党总支书记和教研室主任亲自到会，通过讨论，大家明确了中央提出的“土洋并举”方针的重大意义，明确了我们不只是要作出一个“土”加速器来，同时，要推广这个“土”加速器，进一步贯彻党的群众路线，大大破除人们对原子能这门尖端科学的迷信，使它直接到广大群众中去，为广大群众所掌握。
    在制造工作中，碰到很多困难。第一个困难是制加速电极的问题，这种加速电极在市场上买不到，开始我们要求自己金工厂加工，他们说做起来不一定合规格。我们就到城里去找手艺工匠，可是，他们也说做不来。我们就想到用代用品，大街小巷，各种商品中去找合适的东西，后来偶然发现一种铝质的小菜碟大小形状和我们要求的相似，而且价钱便宜，便买了两个，经过我们加工后，试验结果，性能良好。而且这菜盆子在小城市、乡下合作社也能买到，公社要作这种加速器也不用发愁了。
    第二个困难是找绝缘材料，我们先买到瓷杯、陶杯进行试验，后来找到一些玻璃杯、耐火砖、瓷砖、啤酒瓶等等共十几种材料，试验结果都不合要求。当时有一半以上的人信心不很大，这时组织上又向我们指出一定要坚持贯彻“土洋并举”的方针，不要动摇。并鼓励我们克服困难，再接再厉地去干。这下又坚定了我们继续找“土”材料的决心，最后终于找到了一种符合要求而又便宜的瓷绝缘材料。
    第三个困难是作土加速器的重要部件——高压电极，在国外高压电极是用紫铜作的，紫铜太贵而且难得，有人提议用薄铝板，这种铝板的厚度只有三毫米厘才合乎要求。这时有些“懂行”的人劝我们说：“你们这样做恐怕不成，别人作过失败了，薄铝板容易敲破，就是不破也不合乎光滑度的要求。”我们想试试看再说吧，不行再想别的办法。我们工厂的一位青年工人张保文同志自告奋勇地来担负这项工作，他在地上挖了一个坑，将铝板铺在上面，用木锤子仔细地一锤锤地敲，敲了一阵拿起来把洞挖得深一些再敲，这样一连工作了四十小时，终于制成了，试验结果性能很好。
    这些问题解决了，我们工作进展得很快，提出要在8月28日以前作好向党代会献礼。在26日那天，我们的加工材料还有一半没有动工，任务紧迫，分秒必争，党总支就号召全室同志支援我们的工作，那天晚上真是人心沸腾，个个热情洋溢，全室像过年过节一样，哪里需要力量哪里就有人，教员、学生、工人、警卫员、党团脱产干部等等都动员起来了。
    在8月28日下午二时，完全由我们自己设计、自己制造、自己安装的我国第一架“土”加速器经过我们二十八天的紧张劳动，终于和我校第三届党代表大会的全体代表见面了！这架“土”加速器估计价值约三千元左右，而每架“洋”加速器至少需用四、五万元，我们的“土”加速器不仅便宜，而且水平也不落在洋的后面。我们认为这是党的“土洋并举”群众路线办科学的方针的伟大胜利！
