Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 24th. The Cairo "Evening News" commentary today pointed out that "The most important thing the United Arab Republic should understand is that the U.S. economy is an imperialist economy, U.S. aid always comes with conditions, and accepting U.S. aid always means sacrificing political independence."

The "Evening News" also said, "Conversely, Soviet aid is unconditional because the Soviet economy, in its development process, does not need to exploit the people of other countries."

The commentary compared the Soviet and U.S. economies. It cited an Associated Press report about the decline in U.S. production and the increase in Soviet national income. The commentary said that the Soviet economy is developing increasingly, while the U.S. economy is declining, especially in terms of the living standards of the working class and their hope for a better future. The commentary further pointed out that the speed of Soviet economic development is much faster than that of the U.S. economic development. It also said that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan will achieve goals exceeding those of the U.S. economy.

    开罗“晚报”发表评论指出 
    美国援助总是带有条件接受就得牺牲政治独立
    新华社开罗24日电  开罗“晚报”今天的评论指出，“阿拉伯联合共和国应该了解的最重要的事是，美国的经济是帝国主义的经济，美国援助总是带有条件的，接受美国的援助总是意味着牺牲政治独立。”
    “晚报”又说，“相反，苏联援助是无条件的，因为苏联经济在它的发展过程中并不需要剥削其他国家的人民。”
    评论把苏联经济和美国经济作了比较。它援引了美联社关于美国生产下降和苏联国民收入增加的消息。评论说，苏联经济正在日益发展，而美国经济正在日趋下降，就工人阶级的生活水准和他们所希望的更好的未来来说，情况就更是如此。评论进一步指出，苏联经济发展的速度要比美国经济发展的速度快得多。它又说，苏联七年计划将实现超过美国经济的目标。
