    Welcome the New Year with a Vigorous Technical Revolution
    Li Shao Chen, Technical Director of the First Machining Workshop, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant

    Our factory has completed its production tasks exceptionally well this year, which is the result of vigorously launching mass movements. As a technician who came from the ranks of workers, I used to believe in the creative power of the masses, but I never imagined that the power of the worker masses, once mobilized, would be so immense.

    Take the technological reforms in our factory as an example. In the past, the technology department mechanically applied process regulations from other factories, divorced from reality, and failed to guide production. During the "Double-Anti" movement, workers had many opinions on the technology, criticizing it as lengthy, tedious, and hindering production efficiency. Under the criticism of thousands of big-character posters, the technology department realized that the technology system had to be reformed, but they had no idea how to improve it. Sitting in the office, adopting a piecemeal approach to modifying the technology, resulted in only temporary solutions, and the problem was not fundamentally solved. At that time, I also thought that the technology problem was complex and difficult to solve. At this time, the working group of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in our factory asked me to rely on veteran workers to conduct process reform experiments.

    One Sunday in May, I gathered several veteran workers, workshop technicians, and foremen to discuss the issue of process reform. Based on the versatility of our factory's equipment and other characteristics, the veteran workers proposed that the preparation of process regulations should only highlight the key points. Detailed instructions should not be given for processes that are common sense to workers, such as how to load parts and which part to process first. Consecutive processes of the same type should be combined as much as possible to reduce loading, unloading, and handling procedures. Based on these two principles proposed by the workers, we trialed several processes, which were simplified by an average of 80%, and the number of steps required for processing was also greatly reduced. For example, the processing of a worm gear for a 1556 vertical lathe used to require eleven steps, including forging, rough turning, and heat treatment. After the reform, it only requires four steps.

    Our success in relying on workers to reform the technology shattered the mysterious view of technology held by technical personnel and found the correct path for reforming process regulations throughout the factory. Later, in order to make the technology more guiding to production, the factory Party committee further abolished the technology department and sent technical personnel to the workshops to prepare the technology, which made it possible for technology preparation to further rely on the masses and combine with the practical operating experience of the masses.

    The success of relying on the worker masses to reform the technology has made us realize the principle that science and technology originate from practice and has broken down superstitions. In particular, process regulations reflect the actual production process. It is necessary to absorb experience from other factories and books, but the key to preparing good technology lies in starting from reality and relying on veteran workers. Because veteran workers have rich practical operating experience, only by relying on them can the preparation of process regulations be done well. Some technicians call preparing technology "returning technology home," which is very true. Now, when our workshop technicians prepare technology, they first investigate and understand the situation in the workshop before preparing it. After the technology is prepared, it is reviewed and finalized by the workers. Therefore, the quality of the prepared technology is generally much higher than in the past.

    The initial production plan formulated by our factory this year was to produce eight varieties and forty-two heavy machine tools. At that time, many people believed that the technology for producing heavy machine tools was complex, and the factory was not yet completed, so they were worried that it would not be possible to complete the plan. However, after the masses were mobilized, the production plan was revised several times, increasing the varieties to twelve and two hundred heavy machine tools. Such a large leap forward plan has now been basically completed. Taking our workshop as an example, from January to April, the production plan was never completed. However, after the technology was reformed and workers participated in management, the plan has been completed every month since May. Our workshop alone has produced one hundred and fifteen heavy machine tools, exceeding the plan.

    In 1959, our factory will have a greater leap forward than in 1958 and will produce China's largest machine tool. According to preliminary estimates, 50% of the production tasks will rely on technological innovation and improved tools to solve. In addition to improving labor organization and further improving technology, we plan to rely more on the worker masses and vigorously carry out the technical revolution to complete this arduous and glorious task.

    大闹技术革命迎接新的一年
    武汉重型机床厂第一机械加工车间技术主任  李绍臣
    我们厂今年生产任务完成得特别好，这是大搞群众运动的结果。我是一个工人出身的技术人员，过去也相信群众的创造力量，但没有想到工人群众发动起来以后会有如此巨大的力量。
    就拿我厂的工艺改革来说吧，过去工艺部门生搬硬套外厂工艺规程，脱离实际，起不到指导生产的作用。双反运动中工人对工艺的意见很多，批评工艺又臭又长，妨碍生产效率的提高。在千万张大字报的批评下，工艺科认识到工艺制度非改不可，但是如何才能改好，心中无数。由于坐在办公室里，采取脚痛医脚头痛医头的办法修改工艺，结果治标不治本，问题并没有解决。我当时也认为工艺问题复杂，很难解决。在这个时候，中共湖北省委在我厂的工作组要我依靠老工人进行工艺改革试验。
    5月份的一个星期天，我找了几个老工人和车间工艺员、工长共同研究工艺改革的问题。老工人根据我厂设备的万能性和其他一些特点，提出工艺规程的编制，只突出工艺的重点，对属于常识性的工序，如加工零件怎样上活，先加工哪一部分等工人都知道的不作详细规定；同一工种连续加工的工序尽量合并，以减少装卸和搬运手续。我们根据工人提出的这两个原则，试编了几份工艺，工艺平均简化了80％，加工所需的工序也大大减少了。如1556立车的一个蜗杆，过去加工要经过锻、粗车和热处理等十一道工序，改革后只有四道工序。
    我们依靠工人改革工艺的成功，打破了工艺技术人员对于工艺的神秘观点，为全厂改革工艺规程找到了正确的道路。后来，厂党委为了使工艺的编制更能指导生产，又进一步撤销了工艺科，把工艺技术人员下放到车间编工艺，这样就使工艺编制有可能进一步依靠群众，和群众的实际操作经验结合起来。
    依靠工人群众改革工艺的成功，使我们体会到科学技术来源于实际的道理，破除了迷信。特别是工艺规程，它是反映实际生产过程的，吸取外厂和书本上的经验是需要的，但是编好工艺的决定关键还在于从实际出发，依靠老工人。因为老工人有着丰富的实际操作经验，只有依靠了他们才能做好工艺规程的编写工作。有的技术人员把编工艺叫做“技术还家”，这是很对的。现在我们车间工艺员编制工艺，都是事先调查了解车间的情况，然后再编，编了工艺再由工人审查定案。因此，编制的工艺质量，一般说都比过去是大大提高了。
    我们厂最初拟订的今年生产计划是生产八个品种、四十二台重型机床。当时许多人认为生产重型机床技术复杂，工厂又没有建成，担心完不成。但是群众发动起来以后，经过数次修订生产计划，品种增加到十二种，二百台重型机床。这样大的跃进计划现在也基本上完成了。拿我们车间来说，1至4月份，生产计划一直完不成，但是改革了工艺，实行工人参加管理后，5月份以来月月都完成了计划，仅我们一个车间就生产了一百一十五台重型机床，超额完成了计划。
    1959年比1958年我厂将有更大的跃进，将生产出我国最大的机床。据初步估计，其中有50％的生产任务要依靠技术革新、改进工具来解决，我们计划除了改善劳动组织，进一步改进工艺外，我们将更好地依靠工人群众，大闹技术革命，完成这个艰巨而光荣的任务。
