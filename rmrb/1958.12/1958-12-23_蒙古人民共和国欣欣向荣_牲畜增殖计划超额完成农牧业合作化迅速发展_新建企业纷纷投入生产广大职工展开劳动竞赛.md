(Our Ulaanbaatar dispatch, 20th) The Mongolian People's Republic has achieved new successes in the first year of its Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) for the development of the national economy and cultural construction. Animal husbandry production, as the main economic sector of the Republic, developed this year compared to 1957. Over the year, the country added more than 100,300 head of livestock, of which state-owned farms completed 100.8% of their livestock increase plan, and agricultural and pastoral cooperatives completed 104.1% of their plan. Seven provinces, including Hentiy, all overfulfilled their livestock increase plans.

The socialist transformation of animal husbandry has developed rapidly this year. Since the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party made the decision at its Thirteenth Congress this year to "enable the majority of individual herdsmen to join agricultural and pastoral cooperatives within three years," the agricultural and pastoral cooperativization movement has immediately unfolded across the country. The enthusiasm of herdsmen joining cooperatives, and the scale and speed of cooperative development, are unprecedented. According to recently published materials, the number of herdsmen households joining cooperatives has exceeded half of the total number of herdsmen households in the country, reaching 56%. Some counties have already achieved complete cooperativization, such as Bayan County in the Central Province. Last year, only 30% of herdsmen households joined cooperatives, but this year all of the county's more than 200 herdsmen households have joined cooperatives. The superiority of cooperativization has also been demonstrated in production. This year, the cooperatives have completed their plans for increasing livestock and handing over animal products very well.

Mongolia has attached great importance to agricultural production in recent years, and the area of cultivated land and the output of agricultural products have been continuously increasing. This year, the area of cultivated land increased by about 30,000 hectares compared to 1957, reaching 118,000 hectares, and the total output of crops increased by 55.5% compared to 1957, of which the total output of grain reached 80,000 tons, wheat increased by 88.5% compared to last year, and oats increased by 1.5 times.

Mongolia's industrial and mining enterprises have added some new construction projects this year. The newly built Nalaikh Coal Mine shaft, confectionery factory, and brick and tile factory in the Mongolian capital have all been put into production one after another. The industrial production plan for the first three quarters of this year was overfulfilled by 1.5%. The Deputy Mayor of Ulaanbaatar, Cha. Qiqi, recently told reporters that according to statistics from the beginning of December this year, the capital's industrial enterprises, which account for 80% of the country's state-owned industry, have completed 100.7% of their production plan for the first eleven months of this year, and the annual production plan can be completed on schedule. The newly built non-ferrous metal mines and oil mines under the Ministry of Geology and Mining have also overfulfilled their production plans for the first three quarters or the first eleven months.

This year, Mongolia's construction projects have made great progress. In Ulaanbaatar alone, dozens of buildings have been completed and handed over for use, including enterprises, school staff dormitories, and social service buildings.

In addition, production emulation campaigns have been launched this year in the national industrial, transportation, and state-owned agricultural and pastoral sectors. 93% of the workers participated in the emulation, and many advanced units and individuals who successfully completed their production tasks emerged. In the first eight months of this year, workers put forward more than 900 suggestions, which saved several million tugriks in funds after being adopted.

The retail sales of Mongolian state-owned and cooperative commerce have increased compared to last year. In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by more than 33 million tugriks compared to the same period last year, which is an increase of 7.6%. Due to the gradual development of Mongolian production and the increase in people's needs, commercial work will be further developed. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held at the end of November made a resolution on improving commercial work, requiring that the retail sales of goods in 1959 be increased to the target for 1960 to meet the growing needs of the people. Mongolia's foreign trade has also further developed. This year, the total volume of foreign trade increased by 20% compared to three years ago. The proportion of means of production such as machinery and equipment in imported materials has gradually increased, and the quantity of finished and semi-finished products in exported materials has also increased compared to last year.

In terms of culture and education, the achievements in the past year have been remarkable. This year, the number of students enrolled in schools across the country has exceeded 100,000. The Mongolian Minister of Education, Zhamusilan, once said that if there were more than 100,000 lamas in the country before the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution and no one was educated, then now there are more than 100,000 people in Mongolia receiving education. The number of seven-year middle schools has also increased this year. There are now six universities in the country, two of which are night universities. A characteristic of Mongolia's education work this year is that it pays more attention to training students to participate in labor production practice. Schools have added labor courses such as ironwork and woodwork, and students also participate in production in factories and mines in the capital and pastoral areas during summer vacation and spare time to help with building houses, autumn harvesting, haymaking, and shearing sheep.

    蒙古人民共和国欣欣向荣
    牲畜增殖计划超额完成农牧业合作化迅速发展
    新建企业纷纷投入生产广大职工展开劳动竞赛
    本报乌兰巴托20日电  蒙古人民共和国在发展国民经济和文化建设三年计划（1958—1960年）的第一年中，获得了新的成就。作为共和国主要经济部门的畜牧业生产今年比1957年有了发展，一年来全国共增加了十万零三千多头牲畜，其中国营农牧场完成牲畜增殖计划的100.8％，农牧业合作社完成计划的104.1％。后杭爱等七个省都超额完成了牲畜增殖计划。
    牧业的社会主义改造今年有了迅速的发展。自从蒙古人民革命党今年第十三次代表大会作出了“在三年内使大部分个体牧民加入农牧业合作社”的决议以后，农牧业合作化运动立即在全国各地展开，入社牧民的踊跃、合作社发展的规模和速度，都是空前的。据最近公布的材料，入社牧户已经超过全国总牧户的一半，达到56％。全国已经出现了一些全部合作化的县，如中央省的白音县，去年只有30％的牧户入社，今年全县的二百多户牧民已全部加入合作社。合作化的优越性也在生产中显示了出来，今年合作社增殖牲畜和上交畜产品的计划都完成得很好。
    蒙古近几年来很重视农业生产，耕地面积和农产品的产量不断提高。今年耕地面积又比1957年增加了三万公顷左右，达到十一万八千公顷，作物总产量比1957年增加了55.5％，其中谷物总产量达到八万吨，小麦比去年增加88.5％，燕麦增加了一点五倍。
    蒙古的工矿企业今年增加了一些新的建设项目。在蒙古首都新建的那来河煤矿竖井、糖果点心工厂、砖瓦厂等，都已先后投入生产。今年前三个季度的工业生产计划超额完成1.5％。乌兰巴托市副市长查?其最近告诉记者说，据今年12月初的统计，占全国国营工业80％的首都工业企业，已经完成今年头十一个月生产计划的100.7％，全年的生产计划可以按期完成。新建的地质矿业部所属有色金属矿、石油矿也都超额完成前三季度或前十一个月的生产计划。
    今年蒙古的建筑工程有很大进展，仅在乌兰巴托，就有几十座建筑物已经建成并移交使用，其中包括企业、学校职工宿舍和社会服务性的建筑物。
    此外，在全国工业交通和国营农牧业部门中，今年都开展了生产竞赛运动。有93％的职工参加竞赛，并且涌现了许多胜利完成生产任务的先进单位和先进人物。今年前八个月，工人们提出了九百多项建议，经采用后节约了几百万图格里克的资金。
    蒙古国营和合作社商业的零售额比去年增长了，今年头三个季度就比去年同时期增加了三千三百多万图格里克，也就是增长了7.6％。由于蒙古生产的逐步发展、人民需要的增多，商业工作将进一步开展。11月末召开的蒙古人民革命党中央全会对改进商业工作作出了决议，要求1959年的货物零售额增加到1960年的指标，以满足人民日益增长的需要。蒙古的对外贸易也有进一步的发展。今年对外贸易总额和三年前比较增加了20％，在进口物资中，机器设备等生产资料的比重逐步增加，出口物资中的成品和半成品的数量也较去年增多了。
    在文化教育方面，一年来的成就是显著的。今年各地学校入学的学生已超过十万人。蒙古教育部长扎木斯兰曾经说，如果说在蒙古人民革命胜利以前，全国有十万多名喇嘛而没有人受教育的话，那么现在蒙古有十万名以上的人在受教育。七年制中学的数量今年也有增加。现在全国有六所高等学校，其中两所是夜大学。今年蒙古教育工作的一个特点，是更加注意培养学生参加劳动生产锻炼。各学校增加了铁工、木工等劳动课程，学生还在暑假和业余时间到首都工矿企业和牧区去参加生产，帮助盖房、秋收、打草、剪羊毛等。（附图片）蒙古人民共和国一个年产25,000吨面粉的面粉厂仓库。
