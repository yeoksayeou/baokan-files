Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 25th. An agreement signed in Cairo on December 24th between the United Arab Republic and the United States stipulates that the UAR will purchase 200,000 tons of wheat and 100,000 tons of flour, worth $24.9 million, from the United States. The UAR will pay in Egyptian currency.

This is the first transaction between the UAR and the United States since the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt in 1956. After Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, the United States refused to supply wheat to the UAR for a long period.

It is also reported that the UAR will also sign contracts with Japan and West Germany for some projects in the Egyptian region's five-year industrial plan. The UAR Ministry of Industry and a Japanese delegation are conducting economic negotiations here.

    阿联向美国买小麦
    新华社开罗25日电  阿拉伯联合共和国和美国24日在开罗签订的一项协定规定，阿联将向美国购买二十万吨小麦和十万吨面粉，价值两千四百九十万美元。阿联将用埃及货币支付。
    这是1956年英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及以来阿联和美国之间的第一次交易。在埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有以后，美国曾经长期拒绝以小麦供应阿联。
    同时有消息说，阿联还将同日本和西德签订埃及地区五年工业计划中的一些工程合同。阿联工业部和一个日本代表团正在这里进行经济谈判。
