    Nanjing Radio Factory Assembly Plant Cultivates Intellectuals from the Working Class
    Establishes Red and Expert University While Building the Factory

    (Our report) The Nanjing Radio Factory Assembly Plant established a Red and Expert University while simultaneously building the factory, recruiting new members who are both workers and students. This factory has become a new type of factory-school that both produces products and cultivates intellectuals from the working class.

    When this factory was established and the school was founded in August, it recruited 107 apprentices. Experienced master workers from the main factory were invited to teach these apprentices the principles of assembly and operating techniques according to production needs. The master workers taught while demonstrating, explaining as they worked. After only twelve days of hard study and practice, the apprentices quickly engaged in production.

    In October, the Party branch established a school affairs committee, with the branch secretary and factory director serving as the president and vice-president respectively. The factory-school has a full range of classes from junior high to university. Currently, there are two junior high classes, two senior high classes, and one university class. Their production and study time is arranged as six hours of production and four hours of study. The school has no full-time teachers, adopting the principle of "the able are the teachers." Political classes are taught by the president and vice-president, technical classes are taught by experienced workers, and cultural classes are taught by apprentices with university and senior high levels of education.

    The Red and Expert University's curriculum is divided into four types: political classes, basic courses, technical theory classes, and practical operation classes. These courses are closely linked to the current situation and production needs. For example, the political class for the university class covers philosophy, national construction tasks, etc.; the basic courses cover physics and chemistry, analytic geometry, and differential calculus; the technical theory classes cover basic radio science, radio principles, and electrical engineering; and the practical operation classes cover all operations, verification and testing, test specifications, and the design of general radios. The teaching materials are based on textbooks and lecture notes from general schools, combined with the needs of the factory and rewritten. Their teaching methods are: combining politics and ideology, combining culture and technology, combining technology and production, the workshop is the classroom, teachers are self-selected, running the school and factory diligently and frugally, progressing from indigenous to foreign methods.

    The preliminary plan for the Red and Expert University is a five-year program: three years of middle school and two years of university. Through five years of political, cultural, technical, and theoretical education and labor, the employees will be trained to become laborers who have both socialist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge, and who can independently design and manufacture products.

    The factory's establishment of a school at the same time as building the factory was opposed by some people, who said that running a school before production has been established would inevitably affect the completion of production tasks. Some emphasized that running a university must have teachers and equipment, and recruit high school graduates to sit down and "fill up with cultural water before talking about other things." The Party branch led all personnel in a major debate against these erroneous arguments. In the debate, everyone clarified that learning and labor should not be carried out in isolation, and that only by combining theory with practice can intellectuals from the working class who are both red and expert be cultivated.

    南京无线电厂装配厂培养工人阶级知识分子
    在建厂同时创办红专大学
    本报讯  南京无线电厂装配厂在建厂的同时举办红专大学，招收的新成员既是工人，又是学生。这个厂成为既生产产品，又培养工人阶级知识分子的新型厂校。
    这个厂在8月建厂和办校时，招收了一百零七名学徒工，邀请总厂老师傅根据生产需要，向这些学徒工讲授装配原理和操作技术。老师傅一边讲，一边做，做到哪里，讲到哪里。学徒工经过短短十二天的苦学苦练，很快投入了生产。
    10月间，党支部成立了校务委员会，支部书记和厂长分别担任正副校长。厂校设置了从中学到大学的全套班制，现分初中两个班，高中两个班，大学一个班。他们生产和学习时间的安排是，六小时生产，四小时学习。学校没有专职教员，采取能者为师。政治课由校长、副校长担任，技术课由老工人等担任，文化课由大学和高中程度的学徒工担任。
    红专大学的课程设置分政治课、基础课、技术理论课、操作课四种。这些课程都密切结合当前形势和生产需要。如大学班的政治课是哲学、国家建设任务等；基础课是理化、解析几何、微分；技术理论课是无线电基础学、无线电原理、电工学；操作课是全部操作及校验、检验和校试规范、一般收音机的设计等。教材来源是在一般学校的课本、讲义的基础上，结合本厂需要重新编写的。他们的教学方法是：政治与思想相结合，文化与技术相结合，技术与生产相结合，车间是课堂，先生自己当，勤俭办校、厂，由土再到洋。
   红专大学的初步规划是五年制：中学三年，大学二年。通过五年政治、文化、技术、理论的教育和劳动，将把职工们培养成既有社会主义觉悟，又有文化科学知识并能自行设计制造产品的劳动者。
    这个厂在建厂的同时办学，曾经受到一些人的反对，他们说，生产没有搞起来就要办学，势必影响生产任务的完成。有人强调办大学必须有师资、设备，吸收高中毕业生入学，坐下来“灌足文化水，再谈别样事”。党支部针对这些错误论调领导全体人员进行了一场大辩论。在辩论中，大家明确了学习、劳动不应当孤立地进行，理论联系实际，才能培养出又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。  （韦顺）
