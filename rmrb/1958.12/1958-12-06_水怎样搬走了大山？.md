　　The Secret of the Earth
　　How Did Water Move Mountains?
　　Shígōng

　　Flowing water quietly passes beneath the mountains. On the surface, everything seems calm, but in reality, the struggle between the mountains and the water never ceases.

　　During heavy rains, you can see this struggle more clearly: rainwater washes away mud, sand, and gravel from the mountains, immediately turning into streams of muddy water rushing down. The steeper the mountain, the faster the flow, and the more intense the erosion. These eroded mud, sand, and gravel are the products of the weathering of rocks on the surface. Once the weathered rocks are carried away, the bare rocks beneath are exposed, continuing to be weathered and broken down. In this way, mountains are moved away piece by piece.

　　The carrying capacity of rivers is astonishing. The Yellow River alone carries 920 million cubic meters of silt and sand downstream and to the sea near Shan County in Henan Province each year. This silt and sand could be piled into a platform one kilometer long, one kilometer wide, and 920 meters high, roughly the size of a mountain. However, not all rivers have strong carrying capacity at all times. The carrying capacity is only significant when the water volume is large and the flow is rapid, with the speed of the flow having the greatest impact. Generally speaking, when the flow velocity doubles, the carrying capacity can increase sixty-four times. Therefore, in steep terrain with rapid flow, the force of the entrained silt and sand is great; in flat terrain with slow flow, it is impossible to carry much silt and sand. If the river water already contains a lot of silt and sand, it will accumulate here.

　　During floods, naturally, more silt and sand are carried away, while during dry seasons, this is reduced. Someone once calculated that during the dry season, the Yellow River carries only one four-hundred-sixteenth of the amount of silt and sand into the sea each day compared to the flood season.

　　Rivers not only carry silt and sand but also constantly erode their banks. Particularly because the water contains sand and gravel, this increases the grinding effect on the rocks and soil of the banks. The riverbed gradually widens, and the upper reaches of the river constantly extend, cutting through solid mountains and forming precipitous canyons. In the struggle between mountains and water, the "hard" mountains are defeated by the "soft" water.

　　However, the situation of this struggle has now begun to change.

　　Because the blind action of rivers has caused a large amount of soil erosion, people have had to join this battle. It has been estimated that in the entire middle reaches of the Yellow River, approximately 3,700 tons of soil per square kilometer are eroded each year. Each ton of this eroded soil contains 0.8 to 1.5 kilograms of nitrogen, 1.5 kilograms of phosphate fertilizer, and 20 kilograms of potash fertilizer. Calculated, how much fertilizer runs away from the country each year! At the same time, it causes silt and sand to accumulate in the lower reaches of the river, thus causing floods. Only the deposition of fertile deltas at the river mouth is somewhat useful to mankind.

　　People use the method of closing off mountains for afforestation to protect the soil. Wherever there is plant cover, the soil is not easily washed away. We have also adopted many methods for soil and water conservation, such as building terraced fields and digging fish-scale pits. We also build reservoirs everywhere to regulate water volume. In the winter and spring alone, the water conservancy projects built in our country have controlled soil erosion over an area of 200,000 square kilometers. The amount of earth and stone work completed on water conservancy projects reached 58 billion cubic meters, equivalent to more than thirty-five times the annual transport volume of the Yellow River. Water and mountains are both tamed in our presence. In the geology of the socialist era, human geological action should become the richest chapter.

    水怎样搬走了大山？
    石工
    流水静静地打山下流过，从表面看来，一切都很平静，其实在这山水之间，一刻也没有停止过斗争。
    下大雨的时候，你可以比较清楚地看见这个斗争的情况：雨水冲刷着山上的泥沙砾石，立刻成为一股股泥流向山下冲去。山势愈陡，水流愈急，冲刷也就愈加厉害。这些被冲走的泥沙砾石，正是地面上的石头风化后的产物。风化了的石头被搬走了，下面光秃秃的石头就又露了出来，继续受到风化，继续破碎，一座座大山，就这样化整为零地被搬走了。
    河水的搬运能力是惊人的，单是黄河每年经过河南陕县带到下游和海口的泥沙，就有九亿二千万公方。这些泥沙可以堆成一公里长、一公里宽，和九百二十公尺高的土台，也就和一座山的大小差不多了。但是并不是所有的河流在任何时候都有强大的搬运力，只是在水量大、水流急时搬运力才大，特别是水流的快慢影响最大。一般说来，当流速增加一倍时，搬运量就可增大六十四倍。因此在地势陡、水流急的地带，夹带的泥沙的力量大；在地势平坦水流缓和时，就不可能多带泥沙，如果原来河水里的泥沙多，就会在这里淤积下来。
    发洪水的时候，泥沙自然也被搬运得多，水枯时，就减少了。曾经有人算过，黄河在枯水季节，每天送进海里的泥沙，只有洪水期中每天搬运量的四百一十六分之一。
    河流不仅搬运着泥沙，而且不断侵袭着两岸。特别是因为水中含有砂石，这就增加了对岸边的石头土壤的研磨作用。河床逐渐地加宽了，河的上源也在不断地伸长，坚固的大山也被切开了，成为险峻的峡谷。在山和水的斗争中，“硬”山却被“软”水战胜了。
    不过这场斗争的形势现在开始有了变化。
    因为河流的盲目行动造成了地面土壤的大量流失，人们不得不加入到这个战斗中来。曾有人统计，在整个黄河中游地区每年每平方公里土壤约被冲刷三千七百吨。这些被冲刷的土壤，每吨含氮素0.8至1.5公斤，磷肥1.5公斤，钾肥20公斤。算起来，全国每年该跑走了多少肥料！同时，它还使泥沙在河的下游淤积，因而引起洪水泛滥成灾。只有在河口堆成肥沃的三角洲这件事，还算对人类有用。
    人们用封山造林的办法来保护土壤。凡是有植物复盖的地方，土壤就不易冲走。我们还采用了修梯田、挖鱼鳞坑等许多办法进行水土保持。又到处兴修水库调节水量。仅仅在去冬今春，我国兴修的水利工程，就控制了水土流失面积二十万平方公里。在水利工程上完成的土石方达到五百八十亿公方，相当黄河全年的搬运量的三十五倍多。水和山都在我们的面前驯服了。在社会主义时代的地质学里，人的地质作用应该成为最丰富的一章。
