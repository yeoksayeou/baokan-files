Touchstone and Others
Lower-Level Cadres Discuss the Gains of Labor
Touchstone
The first time I did manure work, I went to the edge of the manure pit, which was dirty and stinky. I always held my breath when I bent down. But the commune members said, "Ah ha, this manure is really fertile!" Why didn't I have such a great interest? …

Now, through training, I am not only interested in manure, but the stinkier and blacker the manure, the more satisfied I feel. My feelings are gradually getting closer to those of the working people. Manure is a touchstone for the thoughts and feelings of us intellectuals. (Hu Zhaoling)
Labor Taught Me Life
After several months of labor training, I deeply realized the noble qualities of the working people. Now, I no longer think they are ignorant and stupid. On the contrary, I hope to have a pair of hands as strong as theirs, a style of daring to think and daring to do like theirs, and, even more, to have thoughts and feelings as noble as theirs. For the first time, I had the desire to be a real worker. Labor taught me life. (Hong Fan)
“Sitting in a Well and Looking at the Sky” Won't Work
I studied agriculture, but my actual knowledge was very lacking. After coming down here, I felt helpless whether I encountered crop cultivation problems or pest and disease problems. Only by learning from the peasants and studying on my own could I solve the problems.

Looking back on my past work, it was really like sitting in a well and looking at the sky. It took three or four people three years to solve a problem with millet nematodes. How could such a working method meet the urgent needs of production? I deeply realized that in the future, I should go to production, find problems in production, solve problems, and improve production.
(Li Lili)
Philosophical Thought of the Peasants
When selecting and cultivating seedlings, the peasants told me: "If two seedlings are growing together, keep the one that is not yet tall but very strong, and hoe away the thin and weak one. Because the small and strong one still has room to grow, while the big and weak one has no room to grow!" Who says peasants don't understand philosophy? This is a very dialectical idea: Things that look very small now, as long as they are full of vitality, will grow strong and solid. We should support and cultivate these new things full of vitality. Conversely, those things that seem powerful but are actually very empty have no future, and we should hoe them away. (Nu Chao)

    试金石及其他
    下放干部谈劳动收获
    试金石
    第一次干出粪活，走到粪坑边，又脏又臭。我弯下腰总是闭着气。而社员们却说：“啊哈，这粪真肥！”我为什么没有那么大的兴趣呢？……
    现在，通过锻炼，不仅对粪感到兴趣，粪越臭越黑，越感到满足。我的感情逐渐和劳动人民接近了。粪，是对我们知识分子的思想感情的试金石。  （胡兆玲）
    劳动教会了我生活
    经过几个月的劳动锻炼，我深刻认识了劳动人民的高贵品质。如今，我再也不认为他们是愚蠢无知的了，相反，我希望能有一双和他们一样粗壮的手，和他们一样的敢想敢做的风格，更希望能有和他们一样高尚的思想和感情。我第一次产生了做一个真正的劳动者的要求。劳动教会了我生活。    （鸿范）
    “坐井观天”不行了
    我是学农的，但实际知识非常缺乏。下来以后，无论遇到作物栽培问题，或是病虫害问题，都感到束手无策。经过向农民学习和自己的钻研，才把问题解决了。
    回想我过去的工作，真是坐井观天，解决一个谷子线虫病问题，三、四个人就花了三年的时间，像这样的工作方法如何能满足生产的迫切要求呢。我深刻地体会到，今后应该到生产中去，在生产中找问题，解决问题，提高生产。
          （李丽丽）
    农民的哲学思想
    在选苗、育苗的时候，农民告诉我：“两棵苗长在一起了，要把那虽然长得还不高但是很壮实的一棵苗留住，锄掉那瘦长软弱的一棵。因为小的、壮的还有长头，大的、弱的却没啥长头啦！”谁说农民不懂哲学呢？这就是一个很合乎辩证法的思想：现在看起来还是很小的东西，只要富有生命力，就会长得茁壮坚实，我们应该扶持与培养这种富有生命力的新事物。反之，那些貌似强大但实际上很空虚的东西，是没有发展前途的，我们应该锄掉它。（怒潮）
