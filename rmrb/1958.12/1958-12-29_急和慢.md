Title: Haste and Slowness

People who are impatient and people who are slow always have different views on issues, and the two types will always argue. Recently, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party announced that China's steel production for next year is expected to be around 18 million tons, an increase of more than 60% over this year's 11 million tons, which is already an inspiring target. However, impatient people still feel it's not fast enough.

Slow people have different views; they only fear it won't be achieved.

Who doesn't agree with building socialism faster if possible? But everything must be done according to objective laws. The development of the national economy must follow the objective laws of development in each sector, and efforts should be made to maintain appropriate proportions between the various indicators. Exceeding the possibilities of objective laws and disrupting the appropriate proportions of various indicators will surely mess things up. This is called "more haste, less speed," which actually makes things slower.

The intentions of impatient people are undoubtedly good. But one shortcoming is that they rely only on enthusiasm when encountering problems, paying little attention to objective laws, believing that enthusiasm alone can accomplish everything. Slow people, on the other hand, are too self-deprecating, shrinking their subjective initiative to a very small extent, and exaggerating objective difficulties to the extreme. Therefore, they are afraid of making mistakes with every move. According to them, the safest bet is to lie down and do nothing.

To use riding in a car as an analogy. Impatient people always complain that the car is too slow, constantly shouting: Faster, faster, faster! Hoping the car could catch up with an airplane. But the speed of a car has a limit, and exceeding it will inevitably lead to problems. Slow people, used to leisurely paces, get dizzy as soon as they sit in a car, so they constantly shout: Slower, slower, slower! It would be best for the car to follow behind a donkey for safety.

Both impatient and slow people have shortcomings, but compared to the latter, impatient people have a certain charm, as they are full of enthusiasm and soaring energy, like a flame, making people feel approachable. Slow people, on the other hand, are cold as ice. In our country, all unpopular conservatives, onlookers, and accountants belong to this category.

For the former, we love their enthusiasm, but we do not approve of their "haste," because when they are hasty, they inevitably get hot-headed, leading to blind actions that exceed the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, forcing themselves to do things that are simply impossible. In addition to revolutionary enthusiasm, these people particularly need a cool head and a pragmatic scientific analytical spirit, which is the principle we must adhere to in all our work. As for those suffering from chronic slowness, the conservative types, it is necessary to accelerate the heat, make them catch up, and not be a laggard.

    急和慢
    王子野
    性急的人和性慢的人对什么问题的看法总是不相同的，两种人永远有架打。最近党的八届六中全会公布了我国明年钢的产量预计为一千八百万吨左右，即比今年的一千一百万吨增加了60％以上，这本来已经是一个振奋人心的指标了。可是性急的人看了还是觉得不够快。
    性慢的人却有不同的看法，他们只怕达不到。
    能速就速，谁还不赞成快一点建设社会主义？可是凡事总得依据客观法则去办。国民经济的发展就得遵循各部门发展的客观法则，应当努力使各项指标相互保持适当的比例。超越了客观法则的可能，破坏了各项指标的适当比例，就准会把事情弄糟。这叫做“欲速则不达”，反而变慢了。
  性急的人心肠无疑是好的。可是有一个毛病就是遇事只凭热情，不太注意客观法则，以为只凭热情就可以做到一切。性慢的人又太自卑了，把主观的能动作用缩得很小很小，把客观的困难夸得天大。因此动一动就怕出错。依着他们最好是躺倒什么也不干才是万全之计。
    拿坐汽车来打比方。性急的人坐汽车总是嫌它慢，一叠连声喊着：快、快、快！希望汽车最好能追上飞机。可是汽车的速度是有一个界限的，超过了它非出毛病不可。性慢的人踱惯了方步，一坐上汽车头就发晕，因此不断喊着：慢、慢、慢！最好要汽车跟在毛驴尾巴后面走才安全。
    性急的人和性慢的人都有缺点，可是两者比起来性急的人还有一点可爱之处，就是热情洋溢，干劲冲天，像一团火，使人望之可亲。性慢的人则不然，他们冷若冰霜。在我们国家内一切不受人欢迎的保守派、观潮派、算账派都属于这一类。
    对于前一种人我们爱他们的热情，但不赞成他们的“急”，因为他们在急的时候就不免头脑发热，以致超越客观情况所许可的条件去盲目行动，勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。对这种人来说除了革命热情之外，特别需要有冷静的头脑和实事求是的科学分析精神，这是我们在一切工作中必须坚持的原则。而对那些害慢性病的保守派之流来说，则是要加速加热，使自己赶上去，不要做一个落伍者。
