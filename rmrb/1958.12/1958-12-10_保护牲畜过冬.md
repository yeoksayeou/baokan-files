Protecting Livestock Through the Winter
Zhang Ke

Winter is a season when large livestock are prone to becoming weak. This year, due to extensive deep plowing and heavy transportation tasks, livestock have been used excessively. Poor feeding and management can easily lead to weakness or even death. Therefore, many places are now actively taking effective measures to ensure the safe overwintering of livestock. This is essential and is one of the important methods to ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

Can the phenomenon of "winter leanness" be eliminated? People's views on this issue are not entirely consistent. One view is that winter is cold, and grass withers, making livestock leanness inevitable. Consequently, there is a lack of confidence and effort in protecting livestock through the winter. The other view is that although winter is cold, livestock leanness can be avoided as long as overwintering preparations are done well. Therefore, they are actively carrying out overwintering preparations. The distinction between the two is very clear: one fully utilizes human subjective initiative, finding ways, creating conditions, and overcoming difficulties; the other does not utilize human subjective initiative, leaving everything to the mercy of "heaven," which of course leads to unfavorable results.

When we talk about giving play to subjective initiative, we certainly do not mean blind and reckless actions, but rather combining subjective initiative with objective possibilities. For example, the weather turns cold in winter, which is an objective law. This cannot be changed by human subjective efforts. However, after people understand this objective law, they can make some cold-proof equipment to resist the cold according to this law. In the north, water is cold and grass withers in winter, and livestock can no longer use green grass as feed. This is also an objective law. After people understand this, they can store feed for livestock as early as possible according to this law. Last winter, the Xuzhou Special Zone in Jiangsu Province did a good job in protecting draft animals, and draft animals generally gained weight after entering winter. The 46 draft animals in Nianzhuang Township, Pi County, in this special zone generally gained 10% to 40% weight within four months. In the severe winter last year, the Gongzhuling Special Zone in Jilin Province not only did not experience draft animal leanness but also saw 80% of the draft animals gain 10% weight. If Xuzhou and Gongzhuling can do it, other regions can certainly do it as well.

Is the role of draft animals diminishing? This is also a question. A few farmers in Shaanxi believe that mechanization will soon be realized, and draft animals will be less useful. The facts are not entirely like this. After the implementation of the basic farmland system, some land will be reduced, but more processing is needed for the basic farmland. As for the realization of mechanization, it will not happen overnight. Even if mechanization is achieved, draft animals cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, draft animals will remain the main driving force in agricultural production for a considerable period. In addition, livestock manure is a good fertilizer, and fur, meat, and other products are indispensable to people's lives.

To eliminate "winter leanness" and ensure the safe overwintering of draft animals, many specific tasks must be done, such as storing grass and fodder, preparing for cold protection, and preventing and controlling livestock diseases. However, ideological work is the soul of all work. Only by first correcting our thinking can the specific work of protecting livestock proceed smoothly.

### 保护牲畜过冬

    保护牲畜过冬
    张克
    冬季，本来是大牲畜容易瘦弱的季节，又因为今年深翻地和运输任务比较繁重，牲畜使用过多，饲养管理不好，就更容易造成瘦弱甚至死亡。因此，现在有很多地方在积极采取有效措施，保证牲畜安全过冬。这是非常必要的，这是保证明年农业生产更大跃进的重要方法之一。
    能不能使“冬瘦”现象不再发生呢？人们对这个问题的看法还不完全一致。一种看法是：冬季天寒地冻，水冷草枯，牲畜的瘦弱是不可避免的。因而对保护牲畜安全过冬信心不足，行动不力。另一种看法是：冬季虽然寒冷，只要做好过冬准备工作，牲畜的瘦弱是可以避免的。因而积极进行过冬准备工作。两者的是非是很明显的：一是充分发挥了人的主观能动性，想办法，创造条件，克服困难；一是不发挥人的主观能动性，一切听命于“老天爷”的摆布，结果当然不妙。
    我们所说的发挥主观能动性，当然不是盲目蛮干，而是把主观能动性和客观可能性结合起来。比如到了冬季天气就要寒冷，这是客观规律。这不是人的主观努力所能改变得了的。但是人们认识这个客观规律以后，可以根据这个规律，做些防寒设备，抵抗寒冷。北方冬天水冷草枯，牲畜再不能以青草为饲料。这也是客观规律。人们了解以后，可以根据这个规律及早为牲畜储存饲料。去年冬季，江苏省徐州专区由于耕畜保护工作做得好，入冬后耕畜普遍添膘。这个专区的邳县碾庄乡的四十六头耕畜，四个月内普遍添膘一成至四成。吉林省公主岭专区在去年严冬时，不仅没有发生耕畜瘦弱现象，还有80％的耕畜增膘一成。徐州和公主岭能办到，其他地区当然也能办到。
    耕畜的作用是不是越来越小呢？这也是一个问题。陕西有少数农民认为快实现机械化了，耕畜的用处小了。事实并不完全如此。实行基本农田制以后，是要减少一部分土地，但是对基本农田需要进行更多的加工。至于机械化的实现并不是一朝一夕的工夫。即使实现了机械化，也不能完全没有耕畜。因此，耕畜在相当长的时期内还是农业生产上的主要动力。此外，牲畜的粪尿是很好的肥料，皮毛肉等也都是人民生活不可缺少的东西。
    消灭“冬瘦”、保证耕畜安全过冬，必须做很多具体工作，如储备草料、准备防寒、防治畜疫等，但思想工作是一切工作的灵魂，只有首先端正了思想，保护牲畜的具体工作才能顺利进行。
