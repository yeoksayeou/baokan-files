Xinhua News Agency, December 15th, from the Soviet Antarctic "Mirny" Station: The "Pole of Inaccessibility," a point on the Antarctic continent never before reached by humans, has been conquered by heroic Soviet scientists. At 14:45 Moscow time on December 14th, the first Soviet flag was raised over the "Pole of Inaccessibility." Scientists from the Third Soviet Antarctic Expedition established the "Pole of Inaccessibility" station there, the scientific research station farthest from the coast on the Antarctic continent. Their march deep into the Antarctic interior has now been successfully completed.

    The "Pole of Inaccessibility" is located at 82 degrees 06 minutes south latitude and 55 degrees east longitude, and is the central region of Antarctica farthest from all coastlines.

    The new Soviet Antarctic center's research station is of great significance for scientific research. The research conducted there will provide preliminary conclusions on the ice thickness, structure, climate, and magnetic conditions of the "Pole of Inaccessibility" region.

    This advance to the "Pole of Inaccessibility" was completed by an expedition led by the renowned Soviet polar explorer, Treshnikov. This march began on September 27th from the Soviet Antarctic research base "Mirny" Station, after a difficult journey of more than two thousand two hundred kilometers.

    两千二百多公里的艰巨长征胜利完成
    苏联科学家征服“难达之极”
    据新华社15日讯  据塔斯社南极“和平村”讯：南极大陆上从来没有人类足迹的“难达之极”，已经为英勇的苏联科学家所征服。12月14日莫斯科时间十四时四十五分，“难达之极”上空升起了第一面苏联国旗，苏联第三南极考察队的科学家在那里建立起了南极大陆上离海岸最远的科学考察站“难达之极”站。他们深入南极腹地的长征至此胜利完成。
    “难达之极”位于南纬八十二度六分和东经五十五度，是南极洲上离四边海岸最远的中心地区。
    苏联新建的南极中心的考察站对于科学研究有重大的意义。在那里进行的考察工作将对“难达之极”地区的冰层厚度、结构和气候、磁性条件等作出初步结论。
    这次向“难达之极”的进军，是由苏联著名的极区考察家托尔斯季科夫所领导的考察队完成的。这次长征在9月27日从苏联南极考察基地“和平村”开始，途中经历了两千二百多公里的艰难行程。
