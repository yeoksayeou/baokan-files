    Where there's fire, there's smoke
    The Chief of the Fifth Department of the Ground Staff Office (equivalent to the pre-war Army General Staff Headquarters) of the Japanese Defense Agency, Lieutenant General Kumao Imoto, recently made a series of inflammatory and militaristic clamors in the United States. First, he said, "If the name of the Self-Defense Forces is changed to the Army, morale will surely be boosted again." Then he shouted that the Self-Defense Forces "should possess nuclear weapons" and even create a five-unit atomic division!
    However, as soon as Imoto returned home and saw the fierce struggle of the people against the revival of militarism, he hurriedly tried to cover up, falsely accusing others of "misrepresenting" his words.
    Coincidentally, Imoto's superior, Nobusuke Kishi, performed this satirical drama in October of this year. At that time, Kishi Nobusuke also put on a fierce face and openly told the American Broadcasting Corporation reporter Brown about his intention to "dispatch troops overseas." Later, due to the same reasons as Imoto, he had to shrink back and insist that Brown's report was untrue.
    Why did Imoto still fall into this trap, even after Kishi Nobusuke's embarrassing encounter? Obviously, this is because the ambition of the militarists remains. As the Japanese proverb says:
  “Where there’s no fire, there’s no smoke.”

### 有火就要冒烟

    有火就要冒烟
    日本防卫厅陆上幕僚监部（相当于战前的陆军参谋本部）的第五部部长井本熊男陆将，最近在美国连续地发表了一通充满火药气味的复活军国主义的叫嚣。他初则说，“倘取消自卫队的名称而冠以陆军的称号，士气定会再度昂扬”，继而大喊大叫：自卫队“应该拥有核武器”，并且还要搞一个五单位制原子师！
    但是，井本一回到国内，看到人民反对复活军国主义的斗争如此猛烈，又赶忙掩饰，栽诬别人“误传”了他的话。
    真是无独有偶，井本的上司岸信介就曾在今年10月演过这一讽刺剧。当时岸信介也曾摆出一副凶相，公然对美国广播公司的记者布朗大谈其要向“海外派兵”的话，后来由于像井本遇到的同样原因，不得不想缩回去，硬栽布朗的报道不真实。
    为什么既有岸信介的狼狈遭遇在先，井本还要陷进去呢？很显然，这是因为军国主义分子的野心仍在也。正如日本谚语所云：
  “没有火的地方不冒烟。”
