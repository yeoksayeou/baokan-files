    Oroqen Hunters as Forest Rangers
    By Our Reporter
    The Oroqen Autonomous Banner in the northeastern corner of the Greater Khingan Mountains is vast, with continuous forests resembling green ocean waves, submerging all the hilltops, and the rolling tree waves stretching into the boundless distance.

    The spring and autumn seasons in the Greater Khingan Mountains have always been known as "restless seasons." Gales of force five or higher violently churn through the dense forests, renowned for being "impenetrable to wind and rain." Within a few steps, nothing can be heard except the "swishing" and "rushing" sounds. At such times, here and there, one can often see several riders wearing grass-green or dark yellow clothes, with "Fire Prevention Inspection" badges on their left sleeves and "Hunter Forest Ranger" badges on their chests, carrying hunting rifles. They ride spiritedly, sometimes dashing on the tower walls, sometimes appearing on the mountaintops, and sometimes disappearing into the dark, dense forests. They are the Oroqen hunter forest rangers.

    Since the liberation of Northeast China, especially in the nine years since the founding of the People's Republic, the Oroqen hunters have made outstanding contributions to protecting the Greater Khingan Mountains of the motherland, fundamentally eliminating forest fires. Last year, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner was rated as a first-class banner with no forest fires by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, receiving a reward of 5,000 yuan. This year, it was again rated as a national advanced unit in forest protection and fire prevention by the Ministry of Forestry, receiving a prize flag and certificate. This is inseparable from their excellent labor and struggle.

    In recent years, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner has established many forestry institutions. In forest protection and fire prevention, the Oroqen hunter forest rangers work with the forestry bureau's foresters, united like a family. The vast number of employees at the Kuile River Forestry Bureau all say that the hunters are their good teachers and strong assistants in forest protection and fire prevention.

    Under the continuous education of the Party and the meticulous care of the state, the patriotic ideological awareness of the Oroqen hunter forest rangers has greatly improved. Nearly one-fifth of the 150 hunter forest rangers have been rated as forest protection and fire prevention models of the banner, league, or Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Dan Bulun, a nineteen-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, is a child from a hunter's family. Zi Qinghai, a twenty-three-year-old member of the Communist Party, is a young hunter who grew up under the Party's training. They have both attended model representative meetings of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and their contributions to forest protection and fire prevention have received high praise from the state.

    Here, let's talk about some of Dan Bulun's deeds. He was just an eleven-year-old child in the year the People's Republic of China was founded, and now he has grown into a very outstanding young man in the tribe. He is indispensable in everything he does, and forest protection and fire prevention are the most important things in his eyes. Growing up in the forest, he has a particularly deep affection for the beautiful forests. During the annual spring and autumn fire prevention periods, the Banner Party Committee and Banner People's Committee often organize work groups to go down to publicize the significance of forest protection and fire prevention. Dan Bulun found these words particularly warm, and he thought, "Trees look like beauty among beauty, and they are treasures among treasures when used. How glorious it is to be a forest ranger and protect them!" So, at the age of sixteen, he voluntarily signed up to join the "Tuozhamin Nutuk Forest Protection Team" and became a glorious forest ranger. From then on, he always carried his hunting rifle while hunting and patrolling the mountains to protect the forests.

    When Dan Bulun was seventeen years old, in the spring, his team set off from the Longtou tribe to patrol the mountains, passing through the Tuogaolu tribe. With the barking of the hunting dogs, several women ran out of the "Xianrenzhu" (the houses where the Oroqen people lived before they settled down), followed by several girls and children. They were the "fire prevention inspectors" of the tribe, specializing in checking travelers to prevent them from bringing any sparks that could cause a fire into the forest. They not only conducted strict inspections of the Oroqen people of various tribes, but also conducted the same inspections on their own tribe's close relatives. This young man, Dan Bulun, had always been a model of observing the rule of not carrying matches when going up the mountain, and he had been checked all over this time. Several women were checking carefully, in his hat, in his boots, in his inside and outside pockets... they checked everywhere, and found nothing, except when they checked Dan Bulun's shirt pocket, they found a broken match in a small pocket. So he was stopped from moving forward and asked to make a self-criticism and admit his mistake at a mass meeting. The young man's face turned red, and he couldn't speak well. The girls were laughing at him secretly, and Dan Bulun felt that this was more uncomfortable than anything else. From then on, Dan Bulun became even more careful about fire prevention tasks, and his enthusiasm became even greater.

    When he was eighteen years old, that is, in October 1957, one day, he hunted all day, and his whole body was very tired. After dinner, he was preparing to have a good rest. But when he went outside to check on the hunting horses, he found that the twilight sky was a bit red on the side of the northern mountain. Dan Bulun immediately gathered the forest rangers of his team to discuss it, and everyone agreed that this was a fire. So, in the pitch-black night without a moon, Dan Bulun led the team and set off immediately. They walked about one hundred and fifty li, but did not find any fire. However, the horses could not walk anymore. Dan Bulun came up with another idea, letting everyone carry their saddles on their backs and lead the horses back on foot. When they returned to the tribe, it was already the dawn of the next day. The Oroqen model forest rangers are so bravely protecting the forests of the motherland, unafraid of hardship and danger.

    The Gan Kuinu Tuk of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner also did a very good job in fire prevention and forest protection last year and this year. In the past, hunters, especially old hunters, had a superstitious idea about natural fires, believing that man-made fires (that is, good people accidentally starting fires, and bad people deliberately setting fires) could be extinguished as long as we had the drive and the spirit to study and find solutions, but natural fires (that is, lightning strikes in spring) were not easy to prevent, because we didn't know where the lightning would strike, and where to find them in such a large forest! But this superstition has been broken since the Great Leap Forward. The hunters have come up with a way: they have developed the habit of paying attention to weather forecasts and fire hazard forecasts during the fire prevention period. Whenever the radio reports that the Oroqen Autonomous Banner has a fire hazard or thunder, the forest rangers cooperate with the foresters to set off on time, either watching for fire on the high mountains or patrolling on horseback. In this way, since 1957, natural fires have also been controlled by the brave Oroqen people.

    Before liberation, the Oroqen hunters had the bad habit of "using fire to attack beasts," and forest fires continued year after year. At that time, life was like a muddy river, and there was no guarantee of life. How could they have the mind to take care of this and that, love this and love that! After liberation, the lives of the hunters got better day by day, and everything seemed interesting, and everything they did came from their own wishes. Taketabu, an old hunter from Min Nutuk, once said: "I saw that the railway was being built in our banner to develop the great forests to serve the country's construction, and I am very happy. Now I know the meaning of fire prevention. In the past, we Oroqen people lived in the forest, but we didn't know how to protect it." The Oroqen people have made glorious contributions to the country's construction, and there is no end to their model deeds. Under the slogan of "Food can be missed for a day, but fire cannot be prevented for a moment," some hunters who like to drink have even abstained from alcohol to prevent accidental fires, and some who are addicted to smoking lick tobacco leaves when hunting in the forest to satisfy their addiction... They protect the forest with the attitude of masters, making the Greater Khingan Mountains appear unprecedentedly safe and prosperous. The hunters said: "If Chairman Mao comes to see us here, he will definitely be happy too!"

    鄂伦春猎民护林员
    本报记者
    大兴安岭东北角的鄂伦春自治旗，地域辽阔，连绵的森林像绿色的海涛，淹没了所有的山头，翻滚的树浪伸展向无边的远方。
    大兴安岭的春秋两季历来被人们称为“不安的季节”，五级以上的劲风狂暴地翻卷着素称“风雨不透”的密林，几步以内什么也听不见，听到的尽是“沙沙”和“哗啦啦”的声音。在这种时候，在这里那里，你常常可以看见几位穿着草绿色或深黄色衣服、左手袖筒上佩戴着“防火检查”标志、胸前佩戴着“猎民护林员”胸章的挎着猎枪的骑马人，精神抖擞地时而奔走在塔头墙上，时而出现在高山顶上，时而隐没在黑郁郁的密林中。他们就是鄂伦春族猎民护林员。
    东北解放以来，特别是建国九年以来，鄂伦春猎民在保护祖国大兴安岭森林方面做出了卓越的贡献，从根本上消灭了森林火灾。去年鄂伦春自治旗被内蒙古自治区评为一等无森林火灾旗，获得奖金五千元；今年又被林业部评为全国护林防火先进单位，获得了奖旗和奖状。这和他们的出色的劳动和斗争是分不开的。
    近几年来，鄂伦春自治旗建立了许多林业机构。在护林防火方面，鄂伦春猎民护林员与林业局营林员协同工作，团结得像一家人一样。奎勒河林业局的广大职工都说猎民在护林防火方面是他们的好先生、强助手。
    猎民护林员在党的不断教育和国家的无微不至的关怀下，爱国主义的思想觉悟大大提高。一百五十名猎民护林员中，几乎有五分之一的人被评为旗的、盟的或内蒙古自治区的护林防火模范。十九岁的青年团员单布伦是猎民家的孩子，二十三岁的共产党员孑庆海是在党的培养下成长起来的猎民青年，他们都出席过内蒙古自治区的模范代表会议，他们在护林防火方面做出的贡献得到了国家的崇高的褒奖。
    在这里，让我们来谈谈单布伦的一些事迹。在中华人民共和国成立那年他才是十一岁的毛孩子，现在已成长为部落里的一个很出色的小伙子，干啥都少不下他，护林防火在他看来乃是屈指第一的重要事情。他从小生长在森林中，对美丽的森林有特别深厚的感情。在每年春秋两季防火期里，旗党委旗人委经常组织工作组下去宣传护林防火的意义，这些话单布伦听起来特别亲切，他想：“树看起来是美丽中的美丽，用起来是宝中之宝。当一名护林员保护它多光荣啊！”于是他就在十六岁那年自愿报名参加了“托扎敏努图克护林中队”，做了一名光荣的护林员。从那以后，他总是背着猎枪边打猎边巡山护林。
    单布伦十七岁那年春季，他们那个小队从龙头部落出发去巡山，路经托高鲁部落。随着猎犬的吠咬声，从几家“仙人柱”（鄂伦春人定居以前住的房子）里跑出来好几名妇女，后面还跟着几个姑娘和小孩。她们是部落里的“防火检查员”，专门检查行路人，不让他们带一星点可以引起火灾的东西到森林中去。她们不仅对各部落的鄂伦春人进行严格的检查，而且对自己部落的近亲也进行同样的检查。单布伦这小伙子从来上山都是模范地遵守着不带洋火的规定的，这次出来时周身也检查过了。几位妇女在认真地检查着，帽子里、靴筒里、里外衣背兜里……都检查遍了，什么也没有发现，唯独检查到单布伦衬衣口袋的时候，从小兜里搜到了一根断了的火柴。于是他被停止前进，还叫他在群众大会上检讨认错。小伙子脸也红了，话也说不好。那些姑娘们在暗地里笑他，单布伦觉得这比什么都难受。从那以后，单布伦对防火任务更加当心了，干劲也更大了。
    他十八岁那年，也就是1957年，10月的一天，他打了一天猎，全身很累乏，晚饭后他准备很好地歇一歇。可是当他到外面去看猎马的时候，发现黄昏的天空，靠北山头那边有点发红。单布仑立即召集他那个小组的护林员研究了一下，大家一致认为这是火情。于是，在没有月亮的漆黑的夜里，单布伦率领了小队立即出动，走了约一百多里，并没有找到什么火情，可是马却走不动了，单布仑又想了个办法，让大家各自背着鞍子，牵着马步行回来。当他们回到部落的时候，已是第二天的黎明了。鄂伦春的模范护林员们，就是这样不怕辛苦、不避艰险地英勇地防护着祖国的森林。
    鄂伦春自治旗甘奎努图克，去年和今年的防火护林工作搞的也很出色。过去猎民特别是老猎民对自然火情抱有一种迷信的想法，认为人为的火情（即好人不慎跑火失火，坏人故意放火）只要我们有干劲和钻劲是可以找到办法消灭的，但自然火（即春季雷击火）是不易防止的，因为不知道雷击在哪里，那么大的森林到哪儿找去呀！可是这个迷信在大跃进以来已被破除。猎民们想出了办法，他们在防火期里养成了时时注意天气预报和火险预报的习惯。每当收音机里报告说鄂伦春自治旗有火险和雷鸣时，护林员配合营林员准时出动，不是在高山上望火，就是骑着马巡逻。这样，1957年以来，自然火情也被勇敢的鄂伦春人民控制了。
    解放前，鄂伦春猎民们曾经有过“用火攻兽”的坏习惯，森林火灾连年不断。那时候生活像泥河一样，生命都没有保障，那里有心思来顾这顾那，爱这爱那！解放后猎民们生活一天天好了起来，什么都觉得有意思，做什么都是出自自己的心愿。敏努图克的老猎人塔克塔布曾经这样说：“我看到了我们旗境内修进铁路，要开发大森林为国家建设服务，我很高兴，现在我知道防火的意义了。过去我们鄂伦春人身居在森林，却不知保护森林。”鄂伦春人民为国家建设做出了光荣的贡献，他们的模范事迹说也说不完。他们在“饭可一日不吃，火不可一时不防”的口号下，有些爱酗酒的猎人为防止不慎失火竟然禁忌了酒，有些犯烟瘾的在森林里打猎时舔烟叶过瘾，……他们以主人翁的态度保护着森林，使大兴安岭森林出现了空前未有的安全和繁荣景象。猎民们说：“毛主席要来到我们这里看一看，也一定会高兴的呀！”
