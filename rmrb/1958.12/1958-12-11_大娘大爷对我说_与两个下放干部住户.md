Grandma and Grandpa Said to Me...
—Living with Two Transferred Cadre Households
Tian Ma
Grandma and Grandpa said to me, before they even spoke, tears began to fall. One said, "Rongchun is my good son," and the other said, "Ruqi, that girl is really something."

	"Rongchun settled down in my home, and we're as close as a son and mother. He fetches water and sweeps the floor so diligently, and even helps my younger brother study. The night I heard he was leaving, my heart trembled. Rongchun urged me to eat, but how could I get any food down? I said I could only eat if you decided not to leave. You and I are one family, connected by blood and hard to part!"

	"Ruqi, that girl is outstanding, a true heroine in the fields! Not only is she energetic in production, but everyone praises her care for the masses! That time I fell ill in the middle of the night, she rushed to the city to find a doctor, going once and then again, tireless and devoted. People say daughters are close, but she's even closer than a daughter. Now that I hear she's leaving, how can it not pain my heart?"

Grandpa Yang praised his "daughter," and Grandma Sun said her "son" was top-notch. One spoke after the other, both saying that having cadres transferred to the countryside is truly wonderful!

    大娘大爷对我说……
    ——与两个下放干部住户
    天马大娘大爷对我说，未曾开言泪先落，一个说：“荣春是我好儿子”，一个说：“瑞奇闺女真不错”。“荣春落户到我家，亲热如同儿与妈，挑水扫地真勤快，又帮弟弟学文化。晚上听说他要走，我的心里就发抖，荣春劝我把饭吃，饭呀我怎上得口。我说要能饭上口，除非决定你不走，你我就是一家人，骨肉相连难分手！”“瑞奇闺女顶呱呱，田间英雄要数她，不单生产干劲大，关心群众谁不夸！那次我半夜生了病，她急忙进城请医生，去了一次又一次，不辞劳累用尽心。人说闺女亲又亲，她比闺女亲十分，如今听说她要走，怎不叫人心里疼？”杨大爷在把“闺女”夸，孙大娘说她的“儿子”顶呱呱，你一句来她一句，都道干部下放真不错！
