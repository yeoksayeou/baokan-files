Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 12th: The Asian-African Economic Conference concluded successfully in Cairo on the 11th. The conference decided to establish the "Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization" among the federations of chambers of commerce and similar mass organizations in Asian and African countries.

The resolution passed by the conference regarding the establishment of a central organization for economic cooperation among Asian and African countries stated that the purpose of this organization is to "strengthen economic cooperation among Asian and African countries and promote economic cooperation between national chambers of commerce federations and other similar organizations."

The organization will include three types of institutions: a council, a center, and offices. Its headquarters will be temporarily located in Cairo.

The council will be composed of representatives from the councils or similar bodies of the member federations of Asian and African countries. The center will be the executive body of the organization. It will have a secretary-general who will work under the guidance of the executive committee.

Before the establishment of the council, a temporary advisory committee will fulfill the duties of the executive committee. The advisory committee will be composed of eleven countries: China, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Libya, Pakistan, Sudan, and the United Arab Republic.

Asian-African "offices" will be established within the national chambers of commerce federations or similar organizations of each Asian-African country as liaison bodies between the federations or similar organizations and the center, and will be responsible for implementing the resolutions of the council in their respective countries.

Representatives from thirty-nine countries and regions participated in the conference, which began on the 8th and lasted for four days. The closing meeting was presided over by the chairman of the conference, Muhammad Rushdi. The conference also passed four other resolutions.

In a resolution on the European Common Market and its impact on Asian and African countries, the conference pointed out that the European Common Market creates obstacles to the development of international trade and has an adverse impact on the economies of Asian and African countries. Therefore, it is necessary for Asian and African countries to conduct effective cooperation to deal with this challenge.

The resolution stated that the conference recommends that Asian and African countries take steps to promote industrialization, coordinate production and sales, and establish appropriate preferential conditions for trade between them.

The resolution on methods to promote economic cooperation among Asian and African countries stated that Asian and African countries hope to further develop cooperation with each other. The resolution calls for the organization of a research institution to expand trade agreements on a preferential basis, establish joint organizations of raw material producers to deal with the deterioration of world markets, and prevent harmful competition.

The resolution passed by the conference on the establishment of an economic cooperation organization at the government level stated that, in order to promote economic cooperation among Asian and African countries on the basis of mutual benefit, the conference believes that the establishment of an international organization of Asian and African countries is of great significance.

In a resolution on payment difficulties and ways to resolve these difficulties, the conference recommended expanding bilateral financial agreements on the basis of "accounting currencies" and establishing a unified clearing committee to generalize multilateral clearing. The resolution also stipulated that industrially advanced Asian and African countries should help other Asian and African countries develop their economies.
