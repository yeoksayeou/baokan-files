Yingcheng's Experience in Rectifying Public Canteens
Wang Jiaji, First Secretary of the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

After a major rectification, all 1,162 canteens in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, have been consolidated and are continuously improving after universally implementing "one trial" and "sixizations and six haves". ("One trial" refers to secretaries at all levels running experimental canteens; "sixizations" are: diversification of food and dishes, self-sufficiency in vegetables, fish, and meat, semi-mechanization of cooking utensils, self-flowing water supply, and regular sanitation; "six haves" are: have a dining hall, have tables, chairs, and benches, have political and cultural life content, have vegetable gardens, have sauce and pickle workshops, and have pig farms).

At the beginning, many problems existed in the canteens, such as chaotic order, failure to serve meals on time, few varieties of dishes, lack of hygiene, and lack of care for the elderly, children, the sick, and pregnant women, all of which affected the emotions of the commune members. One canteen in the Yuejin Brigade of the Hongqi Commune once affected the labor production of the entire team due to insufficient food and dishes. As a result, some well-to-do middle peasants poured cold water, saying, "Too many pigs, no good bran; too many people, no good food; a hundred people, a hundred minds; canteens are difficult to run well." Some commune members requested to withdraw from the canteen; twenty-eight of the two hundred and sixty canteens in Yuejin Commune collapsed. About 30% of the canteens in the county existed in name only or were not consolidated.

What were the reasons? The main reasons were that the cadres did not have a profound understanding of the relationship between production and life, and they lacked experience in managing collective life. Some commune leading cadres believed that participating in running canteens was not their job, and even thought that doing canteen work was not honorable. Cadres ate in their own "small kitchens" and did not understand the situation of the public canteens. The composition of the canteen staff was seriously impure. Among the 8,784 service personnel in the county's canteens, there were 1,278 landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. The masses in Hongqi Commune posted a big-character poster saying: "The canteen is like a flower, but unfortunately no one cultivates it; all sorts of people run the canteen, and the canteen has become a mess. We are sending a big-character poster to ask the secretary to take care of it." The Yingcheng County Party Committee seized the demands of the masses, organized cadres, and mobilized the masses to carry out a major rectification. It stipulated that all rural cadres must eat with the masses in the same canteen and abolished the small canteens for commune and brigade cadres. Comrade Li Jingzhi, secretary of the general party branch of the Tieniu Brigade of the Hongqi Commune, ate a plate of sour pickles and two meals of undercooked rice every time he first went to the experimental canteen. He not only didn't eat well but also didn't eat enough. An old man asked him, "Secretary Li, how does this compare to the cadre canteen?" He realized that there were many problems in the canteen and that the masses had many opinions. He convened a meeting of the general branch committee to examine the canteen work and carry out a rectification campaign. He first made a self-criticism. Deputy Brigade Leader Ke Jiangou said: "Going to the canteen is like waking up from a dream. Only then did I realize that the canteen is a big problem." The brigade cadres unanimously stated that they would resolutely run the canteen well and personally went to the kitchen to work with the cooks to study and improve the canteen work. In less than half a month, the canteen was run well, rated as a first-class canteen, and won the red flag.

In order to thoroughly transform the work style of cadres, give full play to the role of cadre experimental canteens, and drive the overall great leap forward in canteen work, the county launched a large-scale canteen competition and timely summarized advanced experiences. Advanced experiences were rapidly and comprehensively promoted through visits and evaluations, holding on-site canteen work meetings, and holding cook training classes and cooking technology exhibitions. Comrade Gao Jinsheng, secretary of the Yingcheng County Party Committee Secretariat, conducted an experiment in the "93" canteen of the Hongqi Commune and proposed a competition to the commune cadres. In the first evaluation, Comrade Gao Jinsheng's experimental canteen won the red flag, and the entire commune held an on-site meeting there. However, in the second evaluation, the experimental canteen of Wang Yunzhong, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, surpassed him. So, Comrade Gao Jinsheng personally went to the kitchen again, mobilized the masses and canteen staff to summarize experiences and lessons, and made dozens of different flavors of dishes. In the most recent major evaluation, the experimental canteens of Comrades Gao Jinsheng and Wang Yunzhong both received the red flag. Grasping the organizational rectification of canteens and strengthening the political and ideological work of canteen service personnel is another important link in improving canteen work. The county dispatched 1,260 party members and 1,449 communist youth league members to work in the canteens and selected a group of socialist construction activists and hardworking model figures to serve as cooks. A communist education campaign was widely carried out among the masses and cooks, and they specifically debated whether canteen work was important and honorable. The cadre experimental canteen and the secretary's participation in canteen work was a great encouragement to the canteen professional staff and greatly changed the idea that cooking was not honorable. The county party committee also paid attention to promoting the advanced inventions and creations of cooks. In less than a month, the county basically realized the semi-mechanization of cooking utensils, which greatly improved work efficiency and reduced labor intensity. Therefore, the cooks are more at ease with their work. Then, a large-scale canteen work evaluation was carried out throughout the county, with the theme of "See who makes good meals, has many varieties, and allows commune members to eat their fill and eat well." The county's cooking technology exhibition hall displayed a total of 903 dishes from various canteens. The canteens of the Chun Guang, Yuejin, and other people's communes can use lotus root, tofu, radish, sweet potato, taro, and other things to make more than 100 kinds of dishes. Many canteens can provide a variety of dishes without repeating them for several days in a row. The masses praised the diversification of food and dishes, saying, "The canteen is really well-run, with many kinds of food and dishes, five flavors in harmony, and eight delicacies and ten brocades can also be tasted." In order to allow the commune members to eat well, Yingcheng County canteens are now focusing on the production of non-staple foods, requiring self-sufficiency and surplus. The No. 5 company canteen of the Shuguang Brigade of the Hongqi Commune did not grow vegetables at the beginning because the cadres were afraid of occupying land and using manure, so the canteen often ate white rice. The nearby No. 7 company cadres attached importance to non-staple food production and organized two commune members to grow 15 mu of vegetables. They could not finish eating them themselves and sold 150 yuan, bought meat for extra meals, and the commune members ate and laughed. The county's canteens planted a total of more than 9,800 mu of vegetables, generally with seven or eight kinds of vegetables. The county also stored 1.92 million catties of dried and pickled vegetables, an average of 56 catties per person, newly developed 22,330 self-raised meat pigs, raised more than 3.36 million fish, and 627 canteens established sauce and pickle workshops, and also opened many tofu and noodle workshops. These provide a material basis for the consolidation and improvement of the canteen.

Large collectives with small freedoms, taking care of special circumstances, and providing commune members with necessary convenience are the common requirements of commune members. Ignoring this point will also hurt the enthusiasm of commune members to run the canteen well and affect the consolidation of the canteen. Most of the canteens in Yingcheng County have small stoves in addition to large pot stoves. Some also set up small shops to take care of sick people, women in confinement, the elderly, and young children, adding dishes and meals for guests. Some also set up laundry groups, bathrooms, and barber shops, which greatly facilitated the commune members. At the same time, commune members are also allowed to keep their household small stoves in order to make snacks temporarily or boil water for heating on snowy winter nights to supplement urgent needs.

With the canteen well-run, commune members eat their fill, eat well, and rest well, and their enthusiasm is even greater. At the same time, through the rectification of canteen work, the ideological style of the cadres has been greatly improved. Therefore, the county's production movement has one upsurge after another. During the autumn harvest, rapid harvesting and mechanization were achieved in five days, and the task of rush harvesting was completed ahead of schedule; winter sowing was completed in a timely manner, and the quality was very good. The county's annual grain purchase task has been overfulfilled and put into storage.

    应城整顿公共食堂的经验
    中共孝感地委第一书记  王家吉
    湖北应城全县一千一百六十二个食堂，经过一次大整顿，普遍推行“一试”“六化六有”（一试是各级书记办试验食堂；六化是：饭菜多样化、蔬菜鱼肉自给化、炊具半机械化、用水自流化、卫生经常化、管理民主化；六有是：有饭厅、有桌椅板凳、有政治文化生活内容、有菜园、有酱园、有养猪场）之后。已经初步改变面貌，巩固下来，并且在不断提高。
    开始时，食堂中存在的问题很多，如秩序混乱，不能按时开饭，菜的花样少，不讲卫生，对老幼、病人、孕妇缺乏照顾等等，都影响了社员的情绪。红旗公社跃进大队的一个食堂，曾因饭、菜不足，而影响了全队的劳动生产。于是，有的富裕中农就泼冷水，说：“猪多没好糠，人多没好饭，百人百条心，食堂难办好。”有的社员就要求退伙；跃进公社二百六十个食堂，垮了二十八个。全县名存实亡或不巩固的食堂占食堂总数的30％左右。
    原因在那里呢？主要是干部对生产和生活的关系认识不深刻，加上缺乏管理集体生活的经验。有些公社领导干部，认为参加办食堂不是自己的工作，甚至认为搞食堂工作不光彩。干部在自己“小灶”上吃饭，也不了解公共食堂的情况。食堂工作人员成分严重不纯，全县八千七百八十四个食堂的服务人员中，就有一千二百七十八个地、富、反、坏分子。红旗公社群众贴过这样一张大字报：“食堂好比一枝花，可惜无人栽培它，七杂八杂办食堂，食堂成了乱豆渣，我们送张大字报，要求书记管一下。”应城县委抓住了群众要求，组织干部，发动群众，进行了一次大整顿。规定全体农村干部必须和群众同食堂共进餐，取消了社队干部的小食堂。红旗公社铁牛大队总支书李敬之同志，开始到试验食堂吃饭时，餐餐一个酸咸菜，一天两顿夹生饭，不仅吃不好，还吃不饱。一个老头问他：“李书记，这比干部食堂吃得怎么样？”他发觉食堂问题多，群众意见大，就召开了总支委员会议，检查食堂工作，进行整风，他首先作了自我检查。副大队长柯江苟说：“下了食堂好像睡醒了，这才知道食堂是个大问题。”大队干部一致表示，坚决要把食堂办好，并亲自下厨房和炊事员一同研究改善食堂工作。不到半月时间，就把食堂办好了，评上甲等食堂，得到了红旗。
    为了彻底转变干部的工作作风，充分发挥干部试验食堂的作用，带动食堂工作的全面大跃进，全县开展了办食堂的大竞赛，并及时总结先进经验，通过参观评比，召开食堂工作现场会、举办炊事员训练班、烹调技术展览会等方式，迅速全面推广。县委书记处书记高今升同志在红旗公社“九三”食堂办试验，向公社干部提出竞赛，第一次评比，高今升同志的试验食堂得了红旗，全公社在那里召开了现场会。可是第二次评比，公社党委副书记王运中的试验食堂超过了他。于是高今升同志又亲自下厨房，发动群众和食堂工作人员总结经验教训，并做出了几十种不同口味的菜。在最近一次大评比中，高今升、王运中两同志的试验食堂都得到了红旗。抓住对食堂的组织整顿和加强对食堂服务人员的政治思想工作，是改进食堂工作的又一重要环节。全县派了一千二百六十名党员和一千四百四十九名共青团员到食堂工作，又在群众中挑选了一批社会主义建设的积极分子和勤劳持家的模范人物充任炊事工作。在广大群众和炊事人员当中普遍地开展了一次共产主义教育，还具体地辩论了食堂工作是否重要？是否光荣？干部试验食堂，书记参加食堂工作，对食堂专业工作人员是个很大的鼓舞，大大地改变了一部分人认为炊事工作不光荣的思想。县委还注意推广炊事员的先进发明创造，不到一个月的时间，全县基本实现了炊具半机械化，大大的提高了工效，减轻了劳动强度。因此广大炊事人员也就更安心自己的工作。接着在全县范围里开展了“看谁的饭菜做得好，花样多，社员吃饱吃好”的食堂工作大评比。县里的烹调技术展览馆共摆出各个食堂九百零三样菜。春光、跃进等人民公社的食堂用藕、豆腐、萝卜、红苕、芋头等东西均能做成一百种以上的菜来。不少的食堂在菜食供应方面能做到一连几天不重样。群众赞扬饭菜多样化说：“食堂办得真不错，饭菜种数多又多，五味调和百味香，八鲜十锦也能尝。”为了让社员吃好，应城县食堂现在抓紧了副食生产，要求做到自给有余。红旗公社曙光大队五连食堂，开始由于干部怕占地用粪，没有种菜，食堂里经常吃白饭。怜近的第七连，干部重视副食生产，组织两个社员种菜十五亩，自己吃不完，还卖了一百五十元，买肉加了餐，社员们吃得哈哈笑。全县食堂共种蔬菜九千八百多亩，一般都有七、八种蔬菜，全县并储备了干菜、咸菜一百九十二万斤，平均每人五十六斤，新发展了自食肉猪二万二千三百三十头，养鱼三百三十六万余尾，而且有六百二十七个食堂建立了酱园，还开办了不少的豆腐坊和粉坊。这些都为食堂的巩固提高，提供了物质基础。
    大集体小自由，照顾特殊情况，给社员以必要的方便，是社员普遍的要求，忽略了这一点，也会伤害社员办好食堂的积极性，影响食堂的巩固。应城县的绝大部分食堂除大锅灶外，都另备有小灶。有的还设立小卖部，照顾病号、产妇、老人、幼儿加菜和来客的用饭。有的还设立了洗衣组、浴室、理发室，大大的方便了社员。同时，社员的家用小炉灶也允许保留，以便临时弄点小吃或风雪冬夜烧水取暖，用以补助急需。
    食堂办好了，社员吃饱、吃好、歇好，干劲就更大了。同时通过整顿食堂工作，把干部思想作风大大提高了一步。因此，全县的生产运动一个高潮接一个高潮，秋收时，五天实现了快速收割器化，提前完成了抢收任务；冬播及时完成，而且质量很好。全县全年的粮食征购任务已超额入库。
