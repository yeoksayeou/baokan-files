Where is the Best Place to Build a House?
    Gu Hong

    In the cities and villages of our motherland, construction sites can be seen everywhere. New buildings are springing up like mushrooms after rain, seemingly appearing one after another in an instant. In the cities, new factories, new office buildings, new exhibition halls, and other buildings are being built; in the countryside, communal dining halls are being built, new residential areas are being built, and new houses that are practical, economical, and suitable for family reunions are being built. Truly, new houses are being built everywhere. So, where is the best place to build a house? Here's some simple common sense.

    Once a house is built, a simple structure will generally be lived in for several years or decades; a permanent structure will be lived in for over a hundred years, or even several hundred years. If a house is not built well, the residents will feel inconvenienced for a long time. If it is a workshop or factory building, it may affect production or increase costs. Therefore, when building a house, one should carefully choose an appropriate location and carefully decide on the style of the house.

    When choosing a foundation for a residence, in addition to meeting the requirements of urban planning, one should also pay attention to whether the location is suitable, whether the air and lighting conditions are good, whether there are difficulties in water supply and drainage pipelines, and whether it is convenient to install lighting power lines. When building dormitories for workers, it is necessary to consider whether it is convenient for workers to go to work, whether there are markets, schools, hospitals, post offices, banks, nurseries, kindergartens nearby, and also consider the needs of future development and whether there is room for expansion.

    In addition to the situation on the ground, it is also necessary to further understand the underground soil conditions, to see how much pressure the underlying soil can withstand, the height of the groundwater level, and the nature of the groundwater (such as whether it is corrosive, mobile, etc.). Because the quality of the underground soil is closely related to the cost of the building. If the soil quality is poor, sometimes the foundation cost will account for more than 50% of the entire house cost. That is to say, more than half of the money has to be spent underground, which is so uneconomical!

    When building industrial plants and workshops, it is necessary to consider the source of raw materials, whether the sales of finished products are convenient, whether it is close to transportation lines, whether the supply of industrial electricity and water is convenient, and whether there are difficulties in the discharge of industrial wastewater. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider whether the supply of daily necessities for employees can utilize the original city, and whether the layout of workshops and warehouses inside the factory meets the needs of production. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account the characteristics of production and future expansion.

    When deciding on the direction of the house, it is necessary to study the angle of the doors and windows so that each room can have sufficient light. In the workshop, efforts should be made to avoid direct sunlight to avoid affecting operations. When making the overall layout of the building, attention should be paid to beautifying the environment, carrying out greening arrangements, and the aesthetic appearance of the building.

    Economy, practicality, and, where possible, beauty are the three major issues that must be considered when designing. Let us build new houses better so that socialist builders can live more comfortably and happily!

### 房屋修在什么地方最好？

    房屋修在什么地方最好？
    谷洪
    在祖国的城市和乡村，到处都能见到建筑工地。新的建筑就像雨后春笋，好像在一霎那间先先后后地冒出来了。城市里，在盖新的工厂，新的办公大楼，新的展览馆和别的建筑；乡村里，在盖公社食堂，盖新的居民点，盖又实用、又经济、又适合于一家团聚的新房屋。真是处处盖新房。那么，房屋究竟修在什么地方最好？这里介绍一点简单的常识。
    盖了房子，一般简易的结构，总得住上几年、几十年；永久性的结构，要住上一百年以上，甚至几百年。房子盖得不好，就会使住户长期感到不方便。如果是车间、厂房，会因而影响生产，或是增加成本。因此造一座房子，应该很好地选择适当的地点，慎重地决定房屋的式样。
    选择一个住宅的地基，除了应该符合市政规划的要求外，还要注意到地点是否适中？空气和采光条件好不好？给水和排水的管道有没有困难？安装照明用电线是否方便等。建造职工的宿舍，要照顾到职工上工是否方便？附近有没有菜场、学校、医院、邮局、银行、托儿所、幼儿园等，同时还要考虑将来发展的需要，有没有扩建的余地。
    除了地面上的情况外，还要进一步了解地下土壤的情况，看底层土壤能够承受多少压力？地下水位的高低、地下水的性质（如是否有侵蚀性、流动性等）。因为地下土壤的好坏，与建筑物的造价有很大关系。如果土质差，有时基础造价会占整个房屋造价的50％以上，就是说，要花一半以上的钱在地下，多么不上算！
    建造工业用厂房、车间，要考虑原材料的来源、成品销售是否方便、是否接近交通线、工业用电和用水供应是否方便，工业废水的排泄有没有困难等。同时也要考虑职工的生活用品的供应能否利用原有城市；工厂内部车间、仓库的布置是否适应生产需要。此外，还要照顾到生产特点，以及以后的扩建。
    在决定房屋方向的时候，必须研究门窗的角度，使每个房间都能有充足的光线。在车间里，应设法避免阳光直接照射，以免影响操作。在作建筑物整体布置时，应注意美化环境，进行绿化布置和建筑物外形的美观。
    经济、实用，并且在可能的条件下作到美观，这是进行设计时必须考虑的三大问题。让我们把新房屋盖得更好，使社会主义的建设者们住得更舒服、更愉快吧！
