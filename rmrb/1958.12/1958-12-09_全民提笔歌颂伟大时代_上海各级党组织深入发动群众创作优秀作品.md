All People Take Up Pens to Praise the Great Era: Shanghai Party Organizations at All Levels Deeply Mobilize the Masses to Create Excellent Works

(Our report) Shanghai is, on the basis of popularizing mass literature and art, mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to focus on key creative works, preparing to write a large number of excellent works to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day. At present, more than 600 key literary and artistic works have been started by workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, neighborhood committees, government organizations and other units in the city. Among them, more than 20 film scripts have been written in preliminary draft form by the end of November.

In organizing key literary and artistic creation, Shanghai first solved a problem: who should the key creative work mainly rely on? Some people believe that workers and peasants can only write small poems and living newspapers to cooperate with political tasks, and that writing "large-scale" works must rely on experts. Some workers and peasants also have superstitious ideas about key creative work. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party organizations at all levels, these views were criticized, pointing out that regardless of popularization or improvement, we must firmly follow the mass line. Of course, professional literary and art workers must also be mobilized to integrate with cadres and the masses.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party organizations at all levels closely grasped the ideological leadership and organizational leadership of the key creative movement. Under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Shanghai branches of the Writers Association, the Dramatists Association, the Artists Association, and the Musicians Association, as well as the Political Department of the Shanghai Garrison, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Bureau of Culture, and the Municipal Film Bureau, jointly established a key literary and artistic creation office. Party committees, county committees, professional party committees, and grass-roots units were all headed by secretaries to establish leading groups. The Municipal Party Committee closely grasped Party organizations at all levels, from the municipal level, district (county) level down to the grass-roots level, mobilizing layer by layer and fully mobilizing the masses. All grass-roots units continuously held forums and recollection meetings attended by veteran workers, advanced producers, or all personnel, where everyone told stories and talked about themes, and discovered many important themes from archives and previous reports. Under the leadership of the Party committee, creative backbones, cadres sent down, writers, and journalists from this unit were concentrated to form key literary and artistic creation groups according to themes, and a creation plan was drawn up. Workers at the Hudong Shipyard proposed to compete with writers and screenwriters who went deep into the Jiangnan Shipyard, and they collectively created two film scripts, "Fierce Battle of Sixteen Days" and "New Soldiers" (first drafts), in twenty days. The three film scripts "Giant Ship on the Sea," which reflects sailors overcoming conservative ideas in the technological revolution, "Asia-Africa Friendship," which reflects the loving unity of Chinese sailors and foreign sailors against imperialism, and "Fragrance Spreads Thousands of Miles," which describes commercial procurement personnel overcoming difficulties and going deep into the barren mountains to find spices, have all completed their first drafts. In order to create "Fragrance Spreads Thousands of Miles," the Party Committee of the Shanghai No. 1 Commercial Bureau specifically chatted with procurement personnel who went to Sichuan and other places to purchase spices, studied the plot, and formulated a writing outline. The Party Committee Secretary also personally presided over creative meetings. Many unit Party organizations not only grasped ideology and planning, but also grasped creation methods, advocating the combination of collective creation and individual creation. Some units also criticized the practice of only having actual staff tell stories, while those who had no practical experience and sat in offices wrote the scripts, so that most of the main characters described in the works directly participated in the creation.

In this key creative movement, Shanghai also paid special attention to organizing veteran cadres and veteran workers to participate in creation. Penglai, Huangpu and other districts have conducted a ranking of veteran cadres in their districts for this purpose. Lieutenant General Liu Fei, deputy commander of the Shanghai Garrison, and Major General Xiong Rongtang, who participated in the Long March, Zhu Daonan, secretary of the Party Committee of the Shanghai Real Estate Management Bureau, who participated in the Nanchang Uprising, the Guangzhou Uprising and the Haifeng and Lufeng Uprising, and Zhou Guoqiang, deputy director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, who was the head of the underground party and led the workers of the French Tram Company in their struggle against imperialism, have all begun to write. Xu Zhiran, a veteran worker at the Shanghai Cable Factory, has completed the first draft of the script "The First Red Flag." Some veteran cadres are very busy with their work and have some difficulties in writing. In order to help them solve these problems, many units have taken many effective measures.

In leading the creative movement, Party organizations at all levels have adopted the principle of "walking on two legs," grasping both the advanced and the popular, and grasping both key creations and general mass creations, so that these two aspects are closely combined. However, some units have taken detours. In the previous period, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau focused on key creations, concentrating a few backbones and burying themselves in writing "large-scale" works, while only generally calling on the masses to create, setting some numerical indicators, and not taking specific measures. As a result, after more than half a month, mass creation was deserted, and key creations also encountered great difficulties due to lack of materials. After studying this situation, the Party Committee decided to launch a 10,000-piece creation movement in the bureau, calling on everyone to take action and write at least 10,000 works before the end of the year. This call was immediately warmly responded to by the bureau's staff, who formulated plans and started writing. The sailors said that the themes we want to write about are more numerous than the rivets on the ship. The staff of the Democratic No. 13 ship wrote nearly 50 works of various styles in two days. In this way, not only did mass creation flourish, but it also promoted key creation. The key creation group, which had encountered difficulties due to insufficient materials, obtained many useful materials from mass creation, and also discovered seven themes for key creation, some of which were even better than the themes originally included in the plan. The number of key works planned for creation by the bureau has thus increased from four to eleven. Now, the mass literary and artistic creation movement in Shanghai, after writing more than five million works in the previous period of this year, is unfolding on a larger scale. The Municipal Party Committee has launched a mass writing campaign throughout the city on the themes of "A Day of Great Leap Forward" and "Ten Years of Liberation." Factories, rural areas, shops, and neighborhoods, from Young Pioneers to old mothers who have just shaken off their illiteracy caps, many people are writing.

While mainly relying on the masses to engage in key creative work on a large scale, various professional literary and art groups and literary and art workers have also been mobilized. They go to factories and the countryside to closely integrate with mass creation. More than a dozen writers such as Wu Qiang, Kong Luosun, and Sun Junqing, and Tang Tao have served as deputy factory directors, deputy ministers of propaganda of the Party Committee or trade unions, and secretaries in grass-roots units. Professional literary and art workers, while working and training in the grass-roots, actively guide mass creation. They not only explain general creation knowledge, but also study materials with the masses, formulate writing outlines, and help the masses process key works. Screenwriters and directors of film studios are linked with most units that create film scripts to specifically help the masses create and process. Lu Fu, vice president of the Shanghai People's Art Theater, and the creation team of the State Cotton No. 2 Factory are working together to write a multi-act drama reflecting the "May 30th" Movement. Facts have proved that under the leadership of the Party, the combination of experts and the masses is a creative method that is more, faster, better and more economical. Most of the film scripts that have already been completed were written using this method.

    全民提笔歌颂伟大时代
    上海各级党组织深入发动群众创作优秀作品
    本报讯  上海市在群众文艺大普及的基础上，全党全民动手，大抓重点创作，准备写出大批优秀的作品，来迎接国庆十周年。目前，全市工农兵学商和里弄、机关等单位着手创作的重点文艺作品已经有六百多部，其中到11月底已写出初稿的电影剧本就有二十多部。
    上海市在组织重点文艺创作中，首先解决了一个问题：重点创作主要应该依靠谁？有的人认为，工人农民只能写些配合政治任务的小诗、活报，要写“大部头”作品就得依靠专家。一部分工人农民，对重点创作也存在着迷信思想，在中共上海市委和各级党组织的领导下，对这些看法进行了批判，指出不论普及和提高，都必须坚决走群众路线，专业文艺工作者当然也要动员起来，去与干部和群众结合。
    中共上海市委和各级党组织，紧紧抓住重点创作运动的思想领导和组织领导。在市委宣传部的领导下，由作协、剧协、美协、音协上海分会和上海警备区政治部、市工联、市文化局、市电影局等单位联合成立了重点文艺创作办公室。各区委、县委、专业党委和基层单位都由书记挂帅成立了领导小组。市委紧紧抓住各级党组织，从市、区（县）直到基层，层层动员，全面发动群众。各个基层单位都连续召开老工人、先进生产者或全体人员参加的座谈会、回忆会，由大家来讲故事谈题材，并从档案和以往的汇报中发现了不少重要题材。在党委的领导下，集中本单位的创作骨干、下放干部、作家、新闻记者等按题材成立了重点文艺创作小组，订出了创作规划。沪东造船厂的工人提出要和深入江南造船厂的作家、编剧打擂台，他们在二十天之内集体创作出了“激战十六日”和“新兵”两个电影剧本（初稿）。反映海员在技术革命中战胜保守思想的“海上巨轮”，反映我国海员同外国海员友爱团结、共同反对帝国主义的“亚非友谊号”，描写商业采购人员克服困难，深入荒山寻找香料的“香飘万里”三个电影剧本都已完成初稿。上海第一商业局党委为了创作“香飘万里”，特地和到四川等地采购香料的采购员漫谈材料，研究剧情，拟定写作提纲，党委书记还亲自主持创作会议。许多单位的党组织不仅抓思想，抓规划，而且也抓创作方法，提倡集体创作与个人创作相结合。有的单位还批判了只要实际工作人员讲故事，而由那些没有实际经历、坐在办公室的人执笔创作的作法，使作品所描写的主要人物大部分直接参加了创作。
    在这次重点创作运动中，上海市还特别注意组织老干部和老工人参加创作。蓬莱、黄浦等区为此都对本区的老干部进行了排队。曾经参加过二万五千里长征的上海警备区副司令员刘飞中将和熊荣堂少将，参加过南昌起义、广州暴动和海陆丰起义的上海房地产管理局党委书记朱道南，当年作为地下党的负责人之一领导法商电车公司工人向帝国主义进行斗争的上海公用事业局副局长周国强等，都已经动手写作。上海电缆厂老工人徐志然已经写好剧本“第一面红旗”的初稿，有些老干部工作很忙，写作上也有一定困难，为了帮助他们解决这些问题，许多单位采取了不少有效措施。
    各级党组织在领导创作运动中，采取了“两条腿走路”的方针，既抓尖端，又抓普及，既抓重点创作，又抓群众一般创作，使这两方面密切结合起来。但有一些单位曾走过一段弯路。上海海运管理局前一时期偏重于重点创作，集中少数骨干，埋头写“大部头”作品，而对群众创作只作了一般号召，提了些数字指标，没有采取具体措施，结果过了半个多月，群众创作冷冷清清，重点创作也因材料不足遇到了很大困难。党委研究了这一情况之后，决定在全局展开万篇创作运动，号召人人动手，在年底以前至少写出一万篇作品来。这一号召立即得到全局职工的热烈响应，纷纷订出计划，动手写作，海员们说，我们要写的题材比轮船上的铆钉还要多。民主十三号轮的职工在两天之中就写出各种体裁的作品近五十篇。这样一来，不但群众创作蓬勃展开了，而且也推动了重点创作。原来因为材料不足遇到困难的重点创作组，从群众创作中得到了不少有用的素材，而且又发现了七个重点创作的题材，有的题材比原来列入计划的题材还要好。全局计划创作的重点作品于是由四个增加到十一个。现在全上海市的群众文艺创作运动，继今年前一时期写出五百多万篇作品之后，正在更大规模地展开。市委在全市范围内发起了以“大跃进一日”和“解放十年”为题的群众征文，工厂、农村、商店、里弄，从少先队员到刚刚摘掉文盲帽子的老妈妈，许多人都在动手创作。
    在主要依靠群众大搞重点创作的同时，各个专业的文艺团体和文艺工作者也都已经动员起来，他们下厂下乡，和群众创作密切结合。作家吴强、孔罗荪、孙峻青、唐韬等十多人都在基层单位中担任了副厂长、党委或工会的宣传部副部长、干事等职务。专业文艺工作者在基层中一面劳动锻炼，一面积极辅导群众创作，他们不仅讲解一般创作常识，还和群众一起研究材料，拟写作提纲，帮助群众对重点作品进行加工工作。电影制片厂的编剧、导演，同大部分创作电影剧本的单位都挂上了钩，具体帮助群众进行创作和加工。上海人民艺术剧院副院长吕复和国棉二厂党委创作组合作正在写一个反映“五卅”运动的多幕话剧。事实证明，在党的领导下，专家与群众相结合，是一种多快好省的创作方法。目前已经脱稿的电影剧本大多数都是用这种方法写出的。
