A Good Organizational Form for Implementing the Mass Line in Design Work
Tianjin Power Machine Factory Establishes "Three-Combination Design Institute"

(Reported by this newspaper) The Tianjin Power Machine Factory, in preparation for the great leap forward in production next year, has established a "Three-Combination Design Institute" composed of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel. Through this organizational form, the broad masses have been投入 (put into/invested in) the technical innovation movement, actively tapping production potential, and designing and manufacturing simple machine tools. In just over a month, the "Three-Combination Design Institute" has designed 112 items and more than 800 machine tools. This approach not only provides favorable conditions for the realization of next year's production leap forward plan, but also has caused many profound changes in the factory's technical work, production management, and employee ideology.

The "Three-Combination Design Institute" established by each workshop in the factory is a mass organization. Under the leadership of the factory Party committee and workshop branches, it absorbs the vast majority of cadres, workers, and technical personnel in the workshop. The work content of the "Three-Combination Design Institute" is, first, to tap production potential,改造 (remodel/transform) old machine tools, and improve工艺路线 (technological/technical routes) according to next year's production tasks. The second is to design and manufacture simple machine tools to improve production capacity. These "design institutes" have proposed many measures to greatly increase production capacity. The Second Machining Workshop's car planing group originally needed to add more than ten pieces of equipment to increase output to 300,000 horsepower. After the "design institute" tapped potential, improved fixtures, and adjusted technological routes, only nine self-made simple machine tools were needed to increase output to 1 million horsepower. Now, the production capacity of each workshop and group in the factory has generally reached the requirements of next year's leap forward targets.

The working methods of the "Three-Combination Design Institute" generally take the following three forms: One is that workers in each group propose production improvement plans or diagrams, and technical personnel make technical designs based on them, which are then jointly reviewed and decided by cadres, workers, and technical personnel. The second is that technical personnel first propose technical designs and opinions on improving production, and then cadres, workers, and technical personnel study and modify them together before finalizing them. The third is that cadres, workers, and technical personnel jointly propose production improvement plans and jointly design and manufacture. These practices have effectively combined the production experience of workers with the theoretical knowledge of technical personnel. These "design institutes" also implemented the method of designing and manufacturing simultaneously. Seventy-two machine tools have already been manufactured.

The emergence of the Tianjin Power Machine Factory's "Three-Combination Design Institute" is the result of putting politics in command, liberating thought, and launching a mass movement. On the basis of implementing "two participations and one reform," the factory Party committee studied the experience of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province in launching a mass movement and manufacturing simple equipment themselves, and proposed the establishment of a "Three-Combination Design Institute." After each workshop established a "design institute," the factory Party organization grasped ideological leadership and promptly put forward guiding principles and tasks for the workers. Many leading cadres of the factory and workshops, together with the workers and technical personnel, participated in design, manufacturing, and other work in the "design institute." Leadership work has become more in-depth. Based on the good experience created by the masses in the design, the Party organization promptly summarized and formulated five principles that must be jointly observed in the design. These five principles are: (1) Simple and easy to make, pay attention to reducing the labor intensity of workers. (2) The newly designed simple machine tools generally do not have lower production efficiency and processing quality than existing equipment. (3) Pay attention to using existing design drawings, and standardize machine tool parts as much as possible. (4) The raw materials for manufacturing simple machine tools should be based on the factory itself, and waste materials and stagnant materials should be used as much as possible. (5) Design in response to production needs and solve key production problems. These five principles armed the masses and played a major role in implementing the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical in design work.

The "Three-Combination Design Institute" has implemented the mass line in technical work, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. According to the factory's technical personnel, the 112 items and more than 800 machine tools designed by the "design institute" in more than a month would have taken at least two years using the previous design methods. These machine tools are of relatively good quality because they concentrate the wisdom of workers and engineering technicians. For example, the土龙门铣床 (homemade gantry milling machine) designed and manufactured by the employees of the Second Machining Department has a tolerance of only 0.03 centimeters on the five-meter-long bed track, and the processing efficiency is twice that of the original single-arm planer. The activities of the "design institute" have also broken the view of technical mystery and vigorously promoted the factory's technical revolution. At the same time, it has broken through some unreasonable rules and regulations and provided a direction for further improving enterprise management. In the past, workers rarely participated in opinions on design and technology. Now that design and manufacturing are combined, design work and technology work are truly relying on the masses, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses are fully发挥 (brought into play).

At present, the Tianjin Power Machine Factory's "Three-Combination Design Institute" is becoming more and more massive, and the content is becoming richer and richer, and has expanded from the design and manufacture of simple machine tools to the technical management of workshops.

### 设计工作贯彻群众路线的良好组织形式  天津动力机厂办“三结合设计院”

    设计工作贯彻群众路线的良好组织形式
    天津动力机厂办“三结合设计院”
    本报讯  天津动力机厂在准备明年生产大跃进的过程中，领导干部、工人和技术人员共同组成了“三结合设计院”。通过这种组织形式，广大群众投入了技术革新运动，积极挖掘生产潜力，设计和制造简易机床。仅仅一个多月的时间，“三结合设计院”就设计出一百一十二项、八百多台机床。这种作法不但为明年生产跃进计划的实现提供了有利条件，还在工厂的技术工作、生产管理以及职工思想等方面引起了许多深刻的变化。
    这个厂各车间分别建立的“三结合设计院”是一种群众性的组织，在工厂党委和车间支部的领导下，吸收车间绝大部分干部、工人、技术人员参加。“三结合设计院”的工作内容，首先是根据明年的生产任务，挖掘生产潜力，改造旧机床，改进工艺路线。其次是设计和制造简易机床，提高生产能力。这些“设计院”提出了许多措施，使生产能力大大提高。第二机工车间车刨小组原来要增加十多台设备，才能把产量提高到三十万马力，经过“设计院”挖掘潜力，改进工卡具，调整工艺路线，只要自制九台简易机床，就能把产量提高到一百万马力。现在，全厂各车间、小组的生产能力已经普遍达到了明年跃进指标的要求。
    “三结合设计院”的工作方法，一般采取以下三种形式：一种是，各小组工人提改进生产方案或示意图，技术人员根据它们做技术设计，然后由干部、工人和技术人员共同审查决定；另一种是，先由技术人员提出技术设计和改进生产的意见，再由干部、工人和技术人员一起研究修改，最后定案；第三种是，干部、工人和技术人员一起提改进生产方案，一起设计和制造。这些作法都使工人的生产经验和技术人员的理论知识有效地结合了起来。这些“设计院”还实行了边设计边制造的办法。现在已经制造出七十二台机床。
    天津动力机厂“三结合设计院”的出现，是政治挂帅、解放思想、大搞群众运动的结果。工厂党委在贯彻“两参一改”的基础上，学习长春第一汽车制造厂和河北省天津专区大搞群众运动、自己制造简易设备的经验，提出要建立“三结合设计院”。各车间建立“设计院”以后，工厂党组织抓紧了思想领导，及时为职工提出方针任务。工厂、车间的许多领导干部同工人群众、技术人员一起，在“设计院”中参加设计、制造等工作。领导工作更加深入。党组织根据群众在设计中创造的好经验，及时总结制定了设计中必须共同遵守的五项原则。这五项原则是：（一）简易好做，注意减轻工人的劳动强度。（二）新设计的简易机床，一般不低于现有设备的生产效率和加工质量。（三）注意利用现成设计图纸，机床部件尽量标准化。（四）制造简易机床的原材料要立足本厂，尽量利用废料和呆滞材料。（五）针对生产需要进行设计，解决生产关键问题。这五项原则武装了群众，对设计工作贯彻多快好省的方针起了重大作用。
    “三结合设计院”使技术工作贯彻了群众路线，做到多快好省。“设计院”一个多月设计的一百一十二项、八百多台机床，据工厂技术人员说，按照过去的设计方法，最少需要两年时间。这些机床由于集中了工人和工程技术人员的智慧，质量都比较好。例如第二机工部职工自己设计和制造的土龙门铣床，五公尺长的床面轨道只有零点零三厘米的公差，加工效率比原有的单臂刨床高两倍。“设计院”的活动还打破了技术神秘观点，有力地推进了工厂的技术革命。同时，冲破了一些不合理的规章制度，为进一步改进企业管理提供了方向。过去在设计和工艺方面，工人群众往往很少参加意见。现在设计和制造结合起来了，设计工作、工艺工作真正作到了依靠群众，群众的积极性、创造性得到充分发挥。
    目前，这个厂的“三结合设计院”群众性越来越大，内容越来越丰富，已由简易机床的设计制造，扩大到车间的技术管理。
