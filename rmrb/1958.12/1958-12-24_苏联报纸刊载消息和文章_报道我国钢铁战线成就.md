Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd. Today, all major newspapers in Moscow published news about our country's early and overfulfilled target of 10.7 million tons of steel. "Red Star" also published an article, hailing the brilliant achievements of our country on the steel front.

The article said that the Soviet people and the working people of all socialist countries are sincerely happy for the achievements of our Chinese brothers, because the stronger each socialist country is, the stronger the entire socialist camp will be.

The article pointed out that it takes capitalist countries seven to more than thirty years to double their steel production, while China has completed it in only one year. In addition to relying on modern enterprises, it has also mobilized the masses in various places to make steel. Small streams converge into a big river, which generates a powerful steel flow.

The article concluded that China's metallurgical industry is advancing further on the road of development by walking on two legs.

    苏联报纸刊载消息和文章
    报道我国钢铁战线成就
    新华社莫斯科23日电  今天莫斯科各主要报纸都刊登了我国提前超额完成一○七○万吨钢的消息。“红星报”还发表了文章，欢呼我国在钢铁战线上所取得的这一辉煌成就。
    文章说，苏联人民和社会主义阵营各国劳动人民都衷心地为中国兄弟的成绩而高兴，因为每个社会主义国家的力量越强大，整个社会主义阵营也就越强大。
    文章指出，资本主义国家需要七年到三十多年的时间才能完成使钢产量翻一番的任务，而中国仅在一年的时间就完成了。除了依靠现代化的企业外，还发动了各地群众炼钢。小溪汇成大河，这就产生了强大的钢流。
    文章最后说，中国的冶金工业正在以两条腿走路的方法在进一步发展的道路上前进。
