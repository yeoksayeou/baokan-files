    "The Rising Sun" and "Monstrous Shadow"
    Xie Fan
    The Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is an enthusiastic poem praising the people's commune movement. It uses "the rising sun" to describe the people's commune, and there is truly no better metaphor! For half a billion Chinese peasants, the people's commune is the rising sun that shines on the earth and increases the vitality of all things! In the eyes of all reactionaries, however, it is a "monstrous shadow" that throws them into panic. This naturally reminds us of the course of communism's appearance on the world political stage. When communism first appeared in Europe, it aroused the fear of the bourgeoisie, who regarded it as a terrifying "monstrous shadow." As Marx and Engels said in the "Communist Manifesto":
        "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism.
    All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to
    exorcise this specter"!
  However, this "united" attack, although it temporarily thwarted the initial spark of a new type of social organization—the Paris Commune—could not extinguish this "monstrous shadow." On the contrary, it became increasingly deeply rooted in people's hearts, and finally, seventy years after the publication of the "Communist Manifesto," there appeared a mature form of the future society—the Soviet Union, which achieved a great victory in Russia, occupying one-sixth of the world's land. The bourgeoisie finally saw how this "monstrous shadow" was rapidly destroying its "golden world" of rule. Thus, the "united" call to exorcise the "monstrous shadow" became a "united" military offensive in actual action. However, this Soviet Russia was far from the Paris Commune of that time, and the invaders were instead resolutely expelled. The first country to lead mankind to communism stood firm in the storm, illuminating the development prospects of the entire human world like a lighthouse. However, every step of its progress was constantly subjected to the curses and slanders of the capitalist world. The enemy once pinned its hopes on the breakdown of the foundation of the Soviet regime—the worker-peasant alliance. They mobilized all reactionary forces, including the special agents and bandits Trotsky and Bukharin, to undermine the Soviet Union's worker-peasant alliance, hoping to find the forces of bourgeois restoration in the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the rural economy. However, with the help of the working class, the Soviet peasants found a good organization to move towards socialism and communism, preventing the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the rural economy and transforming the small-peasant economy into a socialist collectivist economy, paving the way for the transition to communism. How frantic and desperate the capitalist world was at that time!
    Since the victory of the revolution of 600 million Chinese people, the Dulles clique has also pinned its hopes on the breakdown of the worker-peasant alliance. They fantasized every day that Chinese peasants would riot. But the result was that the rising sun of the people's commune appeared in the East, and another new type of social organization stepped onto the historical stage with powerful strides. Its emergence will completely change the face of the old Chinese countryside and lay the foundation for the Chinese people to transition from socialism to communism. This great historical change, which concerns a quarter of the world's population, is an even more serious blow to the capitalist world. The Dulles clique, of course, regards it as a terrifying "monstrous shadow" and does its utmost to curse and slander it. However, if the European bourgeoisie had the strength to attack the immature Paris Commune in 1871, and in 1918 could put together an interventionist army of more than a dozen countries to attack the Soviet Union (although they were battered and bruised), then, in today's world situation where the balance of power has completely changed, the clowns of the Dulles clique cannot even find appropriate terms to attack communism for China's great historical changes. Strangely, they have suddenly become interested in the dead feudal patriarchal system, vying to play the role of filial sons and virtuous grandsons, wailing in the void as if mourning their dead parents. But what use is this other than to add some laughter to the world?
    The sun never stops running because of the curses of insects. The communist movement has shattered countless attacks and slanders, and is advancing victoriously. The powerful historical march of the people's communes created by 600 million Chinese people will completely stuff these filthy garbage back into the mouths of the Dulles clique.

    “初升的太阳”和“怪影”
    谢帆
    党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”是一首歌颂人民公社运动的热情洋溢的诗篇。它用“初升的太阳”来形容人民公社，真是再也没有比这更好的比喻了！人民公社，对于五亿中国农民来说，是普照大地增加万物生命力的初升的太阳！而在一切反动分子看来，它却是使他们惊慌失措的“怪影”，这使我们很自然地联想起共产主义出现在世界政治舞台上的行进的路程。当共产主义最初出现在欧洲的时候，就引起了资产阶级的恐惧，把它看成是可怖的“怪影”。如马克思、恩格斯在“共产党宣言”里所说的：
        “一个怪影在欧洲游荡着——共产主义的怪
    影。旧欧洲所有一切势力都为神圣地驱除这个怪
    影而联合起来了”！
  但是，这个“联合”攻击，虽然曾经暂时挫折了最初闪现的新型社会组织的雏型——巴黎公社，却扑灭不了这个“怪影”，相反的，它愈来愈深入人心，终于在“共产党宣言”发表的七十年后，出现了那未来社会的一个成熟形式的国家——苏联，在占世界六分之一的土地的俄国取得了伟大的胜利。资产阶级终究看到了这个“怪影”怎样迅速地毁灭着它统治着的“黄金世界”。于是，口头叫嚣的驱除“怪影”的“联合”，变成了实际行动的“联合”军事进攻。可是，这个苏维埃的俄国，远不是当年的巴黎公社了，进攻者反而受到了坚决的驱除。第一个把人类引向共产主义的国家，在暴风雨的袭击中顽强地站起来了，像灯塔一样照亮了整个人类世界的发展前途。但是，它的前进的每一步伐，何尝不是时刻受到资本主义世界的诅咒和诽谤。敌人曾经把希望寄托于苏维埃政权的基础—工农联盟—的破裂。他们动员了一切反动力量，连特务匪徒托洛茨基、布哈林在内，来破坏苏联的工农联盟，想从农村经济自发的资本主义倾向里，找到资产阶级的复辟力量。可是，苏联农民在工人阶级的帮助下，找到了走向社会主义、共产主义的好组织，杜绝了农村经济的自发的资本主义倾向，使小农经济变成了社会主义的集体主义经济，为走向共产主义铺平了道路。当时的资本主义世界，也曾表现过多么疯狂的绝望啊！
    自从六亿中国人民革命胜利以来，杜勒斯之流也曾把希望寄托于工农联盟的破裂上。每天都在幻想：中国农民发生暴动。而其结果却是，人民公社这初升的太阳出现在东方了，又一个新型的社会组织以雄强的步伐走上了历史舞台，它的出现将完全改变旧中国农村的面貌，而且为中国人民从社会主义向共产主义过渡奠定了基础。这关系着世界四分之一人口的伟大历史变化，是更加严重地打击了资本主义世界。杜勒斯之流，当然要把它看成可怖的“怪影”，极尽其诅咒、诽谤之能事。然而，如果说在1871年欧洲的资产阶级还有力量打击那不成熟的巴黎公社，1918年还能拼凑十几个国家的干涉军，进攻苏联（尽管碰得头破血流），那么，在整个世界形势对比完全改变了的今天，对于中国的伟大历史变化，杜勒斯之流的小丑，连攻击共产主义都找不到恰当的名词了。奇怪的是，他们忽然都对死去了的封建家长制发生了兴趣，争先恐后地扮演起孝子贤孙来，如丧考妣地望空悲鸣。可是这除了给世人增添一些笑料而外，又有什么用处呢？
    太阳从不因为虫豸的诅咒而停止运行。共产主义运动，已经踏碎过无数的攻击和诽谤，胜利前进。六亿中国人民所创造的人民公社的雄强的历史行进的步伐，将会把这些污秽的垃圾，完全塞回到杜勒斯之流的嘴里去。
