Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. This year has been a year of rapid advancement and high-speed development for China's machinery industry. Under the guidance of the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," China's machinery industry has advanced shoulder to shoulder with the "Marshal of Steel," with leaps in both production capacity and technological level.

It is estimated that by the end of the year, the total output value of the national machinery industry will increase by more than 80% compared with last year, and the output of major machinery and equipment will increase several times or even more than ten times. The output of metallurgical equipment can reach 180,000 tons, a thirteen-fold increase compared with last year; power generation equipment will reach more than one million kilowatts, more than double the total output during the First Five-Year Plan period; and more than 90,000 various metal cutting machine tools have been produced.

While the output of machinery and equipment has increased sharply, many new products have also been trial-produced in large quantities throughout the country. 1,513 cubic meter blast furnace equipment, 2,500-ton forging hydraulic presses, 25,000 kilowatt high-pressure steam turbine generator sets, program-controlled milling machines, and other heavy-duty and cutting-edge products have been successfully trial-produced one after another. Rolling mill equipment, which could not be manufactured in the past, has not only been successfully trial-produced but has also begun to be mass-produced. According to statistics from only 19 state-owned machine tool factories, 145 new types of machine tools were trial-produced in the first eleven months of this year, including high-precision gear grinding machines and high-precision lathes that can process zero-grade precision lead screws. These many heavy-duty, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge new products mark that China's machinery industry has begun to enter the world's advanced ranks.

This year, China's machinery industry, in implementing the "walking on two legs" policy, launching mass movements, and carrying out technical revolutions, has opened up a path of high-speed development. In large machinery factories, the vast number of employees have used their infinite wisdom to innovate technology, improve tools and equipment, streamline the design institutions of old products, and design many new Chinese-style products themselves, stepping into technological "forbidden zones," which has enabled production capacity to increase several times. The employees of Dalian Hoisting Machinery Plant changed the "box-shaped" structure of cranes to a tubular triangular cross-section structure. The lifting capacity of the crane did not change, but the self-weight of the crane was reduced by more than half, and the materials used to make one crane could now be used to make two.

Many small and medium-sized machinery factories in various places have created a whole set of experiences in using small equipment to do big jobs in the absence of large equipment, thus greatly improving their manufacturing level. At present, general small and medium-sized factories can manufacture heavy equipment or large equipment. In terms of thermal engineering, lacking steelmaking equipment and unable to produce steel castings, employees created a method of "replacing steel with iron." Without large forging equipment, steelmaking furnaces, and iron melting furnaces, employees found a way to first "transform small into large" by casting or forging large blanks into several small pieces, and then "assembling small into large" by welding them into large blanks. In terms of cold processing, they created methods such as "movable" machine tools and "ants gnawing bones" to overcome the difficulty of generally lacking large machine tools. The Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory used these methods to successfully manufacture China's first nitrogen-hydrogen compressor weighing more than 180 tons with an annual output of 50,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer. Jiaxing Agricultural Machinery Factory in Zhejiang Province used small equipment originally used to produce general agricultural machinery to manufacture a complete set of rolling mill equipment weighing more than 50 tons with an annual output of 30,000 tons of steel.

The above is about the "large ocean group." On the other hand, a nationwide mass movement of running the machinery industry in small and indigenous ways, mainly by "building indigenous machine tools and indigenous equipment," has been vigorously launched throughout the country, especially in medium and small cities and rural areas. Many special districts, counties, and people's communes, due to running large-scale machinery factories, can already manufacture their own machinery and equipment to support the development of agriculture and local industries. Tianjin Special District in Hebei Province has manufactured more than 5,900 various machine tools, equipping 162 machinery factories. Fuyang Special District in Anhui Province, relying on more than 11,000 indigenous machine tools manufactured by itself, has equipped 33 county-level machinery factories, and has produced 51 sets of eight and thirteen cubic meter blast furnace equipment, more than 1,000 blowers, more than 16,000 waterwheels, and 5.12 million sets of ball bearings, ensuring the promotion of the "Marshal of Steel" and supporting the great leap forward in agriculture.

The reason why China's machinery industry has achieved such great achievements in 1958 is that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the whole Party has taken action, implemented the Party's complete set of policies of "walking on two legs," put politics in command, liberated thinking, broken superstitions, and promoted the methods of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." The tasks of the machinery industry in 1959 are still arduous. Various departments of the national economy have great demands for machinery and equipment in 1959, and relevant departments are making proper arrangements for production tasks, first ensuring the production of rolling mill equipment, mining equipment, transportation equipment, power station equipment, and machine tools, while also making reasonable arrangements for other necessary machinery and equipment. In 1959, it is also necessary to improve the phenomenon of non-matching manufacturing and supply of machinery and equipment, and to grasp not only the production of main equipment but also the production of supporting equipment, so that the user departments can be fully armed and put into battle quickly to exert production effects. All employees of the machinery industry are welcoming this greater leap forward in 1959 with full confidence.

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. In 1958, more than 100 newly built and expanded large and medium-sized power stations in China were put into production, and began to transmit strong currents to the "Marshal of Steel" and various departments of the national economy. The newly installed power generation equipment capacity of these power stations is a total of 1.8 million kilowatts, equivalent to 2.4 times the total installed capacity added in the country in 1957; plus various types of small power stations that are being universally developed in various places, the total installed capacity of power generation equipment put into production in 1958 reached more than 2 million kilowatts, equivalent to 80% of the newly added power generation equipment capacity in the country during the First Five-Year Plan period, more than 10% more than the total power generation capacity left over from old China in 1949. While a large number of new equipment is put into production, there are currently more than 170 large and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations and thermal power stations under construction throughout the country. Their design capacity totals more than 26 million kilowatts, equivalent to four times the current capacity of all power generation equipment in China.

The practice of high-speed development of the power industry in China in 1958 further proves that "walking on two legs" and the entire Party and the entire people running electricity are the only correct policies for China's power industry. This policy first achieved victory in the power construction in Northeast China. Due to the leap forward development of industrial production and construction in this region, the demand for electricity has increased sharply. In addition, there was a drought in 1958, and some hydroelectric power stations could not play a role, and the power supply was very tight. In order to change this situation, in addition to speeding up the construction of large power stations, various parts of Northeast China also mobilized government agencies, schools, factories, enterprises, etc. to run electricity. In this way, in just a few months, the entire region has built thousands of small indigenous power stations using wind, water, fire, gas, and even flue gas flow, industrial wastewater, and heating equipment as power, adding about 300,000 kilowatts of power generation capacity. Including the equipment capacity of some large and medium-sized power stations that have been put into production one after another, the newly added power generation capacity in the entire Northeast region in 1958 was more than 900,000 kilowatts.

In addition to Northeast China, the power industry in North China, East China, Southwest China, Northwest China, South China, and Central China has also developed greatly in 1958. Among them, in North China and East China alone, 35 large and medium-sized power stations were put into full or partial production in 1958, and the newly added power generation equipment capacity was equal to 40% of the original equipment capacity in 1957. In the new industrial areas such as Northwest and Southwest China, in addition to a large number of small and medium-sized power stations that have begun to generate electricity in recent months to supply the rapidly growing local industrial electricity needs, the scale of hydroelectric and thermal power stations that started construction in 1958 has also greatly exceeded any previous year. At present, there are more than 30 power stations with an installed capacity of more than 10,000 kilowatts under construction in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces alone. After all these power stations are completed, the total power generation capacity will be greater than the power generation capacity of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, which are currently the most developed in China's power industry. In Northwest China, there are also more than ten large power stations under construction in Lanzhou, Yumen, Xi'an, Urumqi, as well as Xining and Ningxia, which have never had modern power plants in the past, and more than 60,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment have been put into production this year.

The construction achievements of China's power industry in 1958 have not only provided a large amount of power for the development of the national economy, but also laid a foundation for a greater leap forward in the power industry in 1959. At present, the design and construction speed of power stations in China has accelerated by more than three-quarters compared with the past, and the average investment per kilowatt has also been reduced by about half compared with the power stations built during the First Five-Year Plan period. Many large hydroelectric or thermal power stations with a power generation capacity of more than one million kilowatts can also be designed and constructed by themselves. According to the preliminary plan of relevant departments, the scale of China's power construction in 1959 will be even more magnificent. A vigorous nationwide electricity campaign will emerge, and the machinery industry departments are also mobilizing all forces to produce more power generation equipment next year to support the development of the power industry.

    岁末频传捷报  全国喜气洋洋
    机械和电力工业跃进年中大跃进
    冶金设备产量猛增十三倍，发电设备产量一年倍于前五年
    建成投入生产的大中型电站一百多座，加紧施工的电站设计能力二千多万瓩
  新华社29日讯  今年，是我国机械工业突飞猛进、高速度发展的一年。在以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针指导之下，我国机械工业与钢铁元帅并肩前进，生产能力和技术水平都有飞跃发展。
    预计到年底，全国机械工业总产值将比去年增长80％以上，主要机器设备产量都成倍甚至十几倍的增长。冶金设备的产量可达十八万吨，比去年猛增十三倍；发电设备为一百多万瓩，比第一个五年计划期间的总产量还多一倍；已经生产的各种金属切削机床有九万多台。
    在机器设备产量猛烈增长的同时，许多新产品也在各地大量试制出来。一千五百一十三立方公尺高炉设备、两千五百吨锻造水压机、两万五千瓩高压汽轮发电机组、程序控制铣床等重型和尖端产品，已经先后试制成功。过去不能制造的轧钢设备，不仅已经试制成功而且开始大量生产。仅就十九个国营机床厂的统计，今年头十一个月就已试制一百四十五种新型机床，其中有高精度的磨齿机和可以加工零级精度丝杠的高精度车床。这许多重型、大型、精密、尖端新产品，标志着我国机械工业已经开始跨入世界先进行列。
    今年我国机械工业在贯彻执行“两条腿走路”方针，大搞群众运动和大闹技术革命的过程中，已开辟出一条高速度发展的道路。在大型机械工厂里，广大职工用自己的无穷智慧，革新了技术，改进了工具和设备，精简了老产品的设计机构，并且自己设计许多中国型号的新产品，跨进了技术上的“禁区”，使生产能力成倍的增长。大连起重机器厂的职工把“箱型”结构的吊车，改为管型三角型断面结构，吊车起重能力没有变，而吊车自重量却减轻一半多，原来做一台的材料可做成两台用。
    各地许许多多中小型机械工厂，在缺乏大型设备的情况下，创造出一整套用小设备干大活的经验，因而制造水平大大提高。目前一般中小型工厂都能制造重型设备或大型设备。在热工方面，缺乏炼钢设备，不能生产铸钢件，职工们创造出“以铁代钢”的办法，没有大型锻造设备、炼钢炉和化铁炉，职工们找到先“化小为大”，把大毛坯分成几小块铸造或锻造，然后再“以小拼大”焊接成大毛坯的办法。在冷加工方面，他们创造了“活动式”机床、“蚂蚁啃骨头”等办法，战胜了普遍缺少大型机床的困难。东北机器制造厂采用这些办法，制造成功我国第一台重一百八十多吨、年产五万吨氮肥的氮氢气压缩机。浙江省嘉兴农业机械厂，用原来生产一般农业机械的小设备，制造出重达五十多吨、年产三万吨钢材的全套轧钢设备。
    以上所述是属于“大洋群”的。另一方面，一个以“大造土机床、土设备”为主要内容的全民办机械工业的小土群运动，已经在全国各地特别是中、小城市和农村中蓬蓬勃勃地展开起来。许多专区、县和人民公社，由于大办机械工厂，已经可以自己制造机器设备，支援农业和地方工业的发展。河北省天津专区已经制造各种机床五千九百多台，装备了一百六十二个机械工厂。安徽省阜阳专区靠自己制造的一万一千多台土机床，装备起三十三个县级机械厂，已经生产八和十三立方公尺的高炉设备五十一套，一千多台鼓风机，一万六千多部水车，五百一十二万套滚珠轴承，保证了钢铁元帅升帐，支援了农业大跃进。
    我国机械工业之所以在1958年取得如此巨大的成绩，是由于在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，全党动手，贯彻执行了党的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，政治挂了帅，解放了思想，破除了迷信，推广了“两参、一改、三结合”的办法。1959年机械工业的任务仍然是艰巨的。国民经济各部门在1959年对机械设备的要求很大，有关部门正在对生产任务进行妥善的安排，首先保证轧钢设备、采矿设备、交通运输设备、电站设备和机床的生产，同时对其他方面所必需的机械设备也予以合理地安排。1959年还必须改进机械设备制造和供应互不配套的现象，既要抓主要设备的生产，又要抓配套设备的生产，以便使用部门能够武装齐全地投入战斗，迅速发挥生产效果。全体机械工业职工正满怀信心地迎接这更大跃进的1959年。
    新华社29日讯  1958年，我国有一百多个新建和扩建的大中型电站投入生产，开始向“钢铁元帅”和国民经济各部门输送强大的电流。这些电站新安装的发电设备容量共有一百八十万瓩，等于1957年全国增加的发电设备总容量的二点四倍；加上各地正在普遍发展的各类小型电站，1958年投入生产的发电设备总容量共达二百万瓩以上，等于第一个五年计划期间全国新增发电设备容量的80％，比1949年旧中国遗留下来的全部发电能力还多10％。在大批新设备投入生产的同时，目前全国还有一百七十多个大中型的水力发电站和火力发电站正在紧张施工，它们的设计能力共有二千六百多万瓩，相当于我国目前所有发电设备容量四倍。
    1958年我国高速度发展电力工业的实践，进一步证明了用“两条腿走路”、全党全民办电是我国电力工业唯一正确的方针。这一方针首先在东北地区的电力建设上获得胜利。这个地区由于工业生产和建设事业的飞跃发展，用电需要量急剧增长，加上1958年天旱，一部分水力发电站不能发挥作用，电源十分紧张。为了改变这种状况，东北各地除了加快大电站的建设以外，还动员了机关、学校、工厂、企业等都来办电。这样，仅仅几个月内，全区就办起了利用风、水、火、气，甚至烟道气流、工业废水、取暖设备等作为动力的小型土电站几千个，增加了发电能力三十万瓩左右。连同一部分陆续投入生产的大中型电站的设备能力计算在内，1958年东北全区新增发电能力九十万瓩以上。
    除了东北地区以外，1958年华北、华东、西南、西北、华南、华中等地的电力工业也有很大发展。其中仅华北和华东两个地区，1958年就有三十五个大中型电站全部或部分投入生产，新增加的发电设备容量等于1957年原有设备容量的40％。在西北和西南等新工业地区，最近几个月来除了已有大批中小型电站开始发电，供给飞跃增长的地方工业用电需要以外，1958年开工新建的水力和火力发电站的规模也大大超过了过去任何一年。目前，仅是四川、云南、贵州三省正在施工的装机容量在一万瓩以上的电站就有三十多个。这些电站全部建成以后，总发电能力将比我国目前电力工业最发达的辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省的发电能力还大。西北区的兰州、玉门、西安、乌鲁木齐，以及过去从未有过现代化发电厂的西宁、宁夏等地也有十多个较大的电站在紧张施工，并已有六万多瓩的发电设备在今年投入生产。
    1958年我国电力工业的建设成就，不但为发展国民经济提供了大量的动力，也为1959年电力工业更大的跃进打下了基础。目前，我国建设电站的设计和施工速度都比过去加快了四分之三以上，平均每瓩的投资也比第一个五年计划期间建设的电站减少了一半左右。许多发电能力在一百万瓩以上的大型水力或火力发电站，也都能自己设计和施工了。根据有关部门的初步计划，1959年我国电力建设的规模将更宏伟。全国将出现轰轰烈烈的全民办电运动，机械工业部门也正在调动一切力量，以期在明年生产更多的发电设备，支援电力工业的发展。
