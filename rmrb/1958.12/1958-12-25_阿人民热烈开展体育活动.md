Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 24th - Sports activities in Albania have further developed this year.

    O. Palushi, editor-in-chief of the Albanian "People's Sports Daily," told our reporter that there are now more than 920 sports groups and teams in Albania, a country with a population of only 1.5 million. There are more than 80,000 athletes.

    A characteristic of the development of sports in Albania is the deep involvement of the masses in various sports activities. For example, of the more than 5,400 athletes participating in the first stage of the national games (to be held next year) qualifiers, the vast majority come from factories, rural areas, and the armed forces. As many as 1,250 people participated in the football qualifiers. Almost every town has its own football team and football field. (Attached picture)

    阿人民热烈开展体育活动
    据新华社地拉那24日电  阿尔巴尼亚体育运动今年获得了进一步的发展。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民体育报”主编奥·帕卢希对本社记者说，目前在仅有一百五十万人口的阿尔巴尼亚，已经有九百二十多个运动团体和小组。运动员达八万多名。
    各种体育活动深入群众是阿尔巴尼亚体育发展的一个特点。例如，在参加全国运动会（明年举行）第一阶段选拔赛的五千四百多个运动员中，极大多数来自工厂、农村和部队的。参加足球选拔赛的竟达一千二百五十人。几乎每个城镇都有自己的足球代表队和足球场。（附图片）
