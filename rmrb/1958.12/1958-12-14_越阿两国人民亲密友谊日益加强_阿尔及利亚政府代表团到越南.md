Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th. The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Minister Youssef Ben Khedda, arrived in Hanoi by plane at noon today. Vietnamese government leaders, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Truong Chinh, and nearly a thousand people went to the airport to welcome the envoys of friendship from the heroic country.

Today, the national flags of Vietnam and Algeria and red welcome banners were intertwined at Gia Lam Airport in Hanoi. When Minister Youssef Ben Khedda and Minister Mahmoud Cherif stepped off the plane, Truong Chinh and others stepped forward to welcome the distinguished guests. Warm cheers rang out at the airport.

The two distinguished guests, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Truong Chinh, reviewed the honor guard at the airport.

Deputy Prime Minister Truong Chinh delivered a speech at the airport. He warmly welcomed the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on behalf of the Vietnamese government and people. Truong Chinh said that the French colonialists attempted to use armed forces to eliminate the struggle of the Algerian people, but the struggle of the Algerian people not only was not eliminated but became stronger as they fought. Truong Chinh said that the spirit of heroic sacrifice of the Algerian people for the right to a free life and for the independence of their motherland has received the infinite admiration and support of all nations in the world and of peace-loving and justice-loving people.

Truong Chinh said that for four years, the people of our two countries have supported each other and have been encouraged by each other. Truong Chinh said: "We believe that this visit to Vietnam by the delegation will further strengthen the friendship between the two nations in the cause of fighting for freedom, peace and social progress."

Minister Youssef Ben Khedda then spoke. He said that the French colonialists had deployed 600,000 modern troops on the Algerian battlefield, and they also received assistance from the United States. The enemy is trying to eliminate us, but victory will surely belong to us. The Algerian people will definitely persist in the struggle for national independence to the end. He said, "Africa belongs to Africans."

Youssef Ben Khedda said that the people of Vietnam and Algeria have continuously supported each other and formed a close friendship in the struggle against French colonialists. This friendship will continue to be consolidated and developed.

Youssef Ben Khedda said that we have the brotherly support of our great Chinese friends by our side. A Chinese friend once said to me that the struggle of the Algerian people can get the support of 600 million Chinese people. This is a great encouragement to us and a blow to imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 13th. The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria passed through Nanning this morning by special plane from Wuhan to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. After visiting Vietnam, the delegation will continue to visit our country.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 13th. The distinguished guests of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria left here by special plane this morning to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after ending their visit to Wuhan.

    越阿两国人民亲密友谊日益加强
    阿尔及利亚政府代表团到越南
    新华社河内13日电  以优素福·本·赫达部长为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团今天中午乘飞机到达河内。以长征副总理为首的越南政府领导人和将近一千群众到机场欢迎来自英雄的国家的友谊使节。
    今天，河内嘉林机场上越阿两国国旗和红色的欢迎标语交相辉映。当优素福·本·赫达部长和马哈茂德·谢里夫部长走下飞机时，长征等人迎向前去欢迎贵宾。机场上响起热烈的欢呼声。
    两位贵宾在长征副总理陪同下在机场上检阅了仪仗队。
    长征副总理在机场致词。他代表越南政府和人民热烈欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团。长征说，法国殖民者企图以武装力量消灭阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，但是阿尔及利亚人民的斗争不仅没有被消灭反而越战越强。长征说，阿尔及利亚人民为自由生活的权利、为祖国的独立而英勇牺牲的精神得到了世界上一切民族以及爱好和平和正义的人民的无限钦佩和支持。
    长征说，四年来，我们两国人民互相支持，而且互相获得了鼓舞。长征说：“我们相信代表团这次访问越南将进一步加强两民族在为自由、和平和社会进步而斗争的事业中结成的友谊。”
    优素福·本·赫达部长接着讲话。他说，法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚战场上投下六十万现代化的军队，他们又得到美国的援助。敌人企图消灭我们，但是，胜利一定属于我们。阿尔及利亚人民一定把争取民族独立的斗争坚持到底。他说，“非洲是属于非洲人的。”
    优素福·本·赫达说，越阿两国人民在反对法国殖民者的斗争中不断地互相支持并且结成了亲密的友谊。这种友谊还将要不断巩固和发展。
    优素福·本·赫达说在我们身旁有伟大的中国朋友的兄弟般的支持。一位中国朋友曾经对我说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争可以得到六亿中国人民的支持。这是对我们的巨大鼓舞，也是对帝国主义的打击。
    新华社南宁13日电  阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团今天上午由武汉乘专机途经南宁，前往越南民主共和国访问。代表团访问越南以后，还将继续来我国进行访问。
