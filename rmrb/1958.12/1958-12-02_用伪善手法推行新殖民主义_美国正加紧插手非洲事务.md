Using Hypocritical Methods to Promote Neo-Colonialism
The United States is Intensifying its Intervention in African Affairs

    This newspaper reports that amid the rising tide of African national independence movements, the United States has greatly intensified its aggressive activities in Africa. A delegation from the United States International Cooperation Administration (ICA) led by ICA Director James Smith and Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite began a visit to Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tunisia in early November. According to Western news agencies, the main purpose of this visit is to promote American economic "aid" to these African countries. James Smith and Satterthwaite are the second group of high-ranking American officials to visit Africa after Nixon's visit in 1957. Prior to this, American monopoly consortia such as the Rockefeller Foundation had sent large groups of people to Africa for extensive "investigation" activities.
    The United States is deeply shocked by the vigorous development of the African national independence movement, considering it a "challenge" to the United States.
    American newspapers reveal that the United States is attempting to use the method of promoting American "aid" to African countries to obstruct the African national independence movement, and to further pave the way for expanding American private investment and plundering Africa's rich resources. The "Wall Street Journal" said that according to the US Department of Commerce, US private investment in Africa was $400 million in 1953, $500 million in 1955, and has reached more than $700 million last year. The newspaper advocated that independent African countries should abandon the government investment management enterprise model and adopt an "open door" policy towards American capital.
    The United States has also recently intensified its cultural aggression against Africa. The American Ford Foundation has decided to provide more than one million US dollars in "grants" in the coming months to "aid African education." Cultural and educational institutions in Ghana, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Uganda, and other places will receive the first batch of "grants." The research projects designated by the Ford Foundation for units receiving "grants" include African political movements, African business management, and industrial technology. These topics are closely related to large-scale American economic aggression activities. In addition, many American companies have recently established specialized institutions related to African issues to study and plan for expanding plunder activities.
    The work of the American intelligence agencies and rumor-mongering machines—the United States Information Service—has also been significantly strengthened in Africa. This work began as early as the beginning of this year.

    用伪善手法推行新殖民主义
    美国正加紧插手非洲事务
    本报讯  在非洲民族独立运动日益高涨声中，美国已大大加紧了对非洲的侵略活动。美国国际合作署长詹姆斯·斯密斯和负责非洲事务的助理国务卿萨脱斯威特率领的国际合作署代表团11月初开始了对加纳、尼日利亚、埃塞俄比亚和突尼斯等国的访问。据西方通讯社透露，这次访问的主要目的，是向这些非洲国家推销美国的经济“援助”。詹姆斯·斯密斯和萨脱斯威特是继尼克松在1957年访问之后第二批访非的美国高级官员。在此以前，美国的洛克菲勒等垄断财团曾经派出大队人马到非洲进行广泛的“考察”活动。
    美国对于非洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展感到十分震惊，认为是向美国的“挑战”。
    美国报纸透露，美国企图用向非洲国家推销美“援”的办法来阻挠非洲民族独立运动，并且进一步为扩大美国私人投资开辟道路，掠夺非洲丰富资源。“华尔街日报”说，据美国商务部估计，美国对非洲私人投资1953年为四亿美元，1955年为五亿美元，去年已达到七亿美元以上。这家报纸宣扬非洲独立国家应放弃政府投资经营企业的方式，对美国资本采取“门户开放”政策。
    美国对于非洲的文化侵略最近也在加紧进行。美国的福特基金会已决定在今后几个月内，提供一百多万美元的“赠款”，“援助非洲的教育工作”。加纳、尼日利亚、罗德西亚、坦葛尼喀、乌干达等地的文化教育机关将得到第一批“赠款”。福特基金会指定接受“赠款”单位的研究项目有非洲政治运动、非洲商业管理、工业技术等。这些题目都和美国大规模的经济侵略活动有着十分密切的关系。另外，许多美国公司最近也纷纷成立了有关非洲问题的专门机构，研究和策划扩大掠夺活动。
    美国的情报机关和造谣机器——美国新闻处的工作，在非洲也有了显著加强。这项工作远在今年年初便已开始进行。
