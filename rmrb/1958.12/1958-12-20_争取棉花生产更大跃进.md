Strive for a Greater Leap Forward in Cotton Production
By Zhang Qiuxiang, Women's Cotton Planting Group, Hongqi Commune, Weinan County, Shaanxi

These days, I participated in the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference and learned a lot. After the meeting, I read the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The communique mentioned the great achievements in agricultural production this year and the grain and cotton production tasks for next year, which is a great encouragement to me. Under the leadership of the Party, I must continue to work hard and strive for a greater leap forward in cotton production in 1959.

Our cotton planting group has nine women, and the average yield per mu of the several mu of high-yield cotton fields we have cultivated over the years has remained around 1,000 jin of seed cotton. This year, our 4.3 mu of high-yield fields produced a total of 7,633 jin of seed cotton as of November 23rd when I left the commune, of which one mu yielded 2,436 jin, and there is still some unpicked. The large area of cotton in our production team has also achieved a bumper harvest. However, we are not satisfied with this achievement. In 1959, we will follow the spirit of the Party's General Line and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session, and make greater achievements in cotton production. Our group originally planned to deep-plow the high-yield fields to a depth of two chi next year (this year it was eight cun), apply 100,000 jin of fertilizer (33,000 jin this year), and further implement close planting and trial cotton seedling cultivation.

In 1958, a total of 120,000 people from inside and outside the province came to our commune to visit. We warmly received all visitors and introduced our cotton planting experience without reservation. I also made 19 reports in six counties including Dali and Fu Ping. Some commune members thought I was delaying a lot of work in the commune and only caring about others. I took the opportunity to say to the commune members: "The purpose of the high-yield movement now is not to increase the yield of one or two mu, but to increase the yield of all cotton fields." No matter where I go, I always treat everyone's cotton as my own. As long as I find a problem, I will give suggestions and improve cotton field management. In 1959, we will greatly promote this spirit of cooperation. Our group's preliminary plan is: next year, in the process of cotton farming, we will write a small summary for each stage, and write down how we close-planted, how we thinned seedlings, and how we trimmed branches, for the reference of brother communes in various places. In addition, when we visit and introduce experience in various places, we must promptly offer suggestions when we see problems, and write down what we learn when we see good experience. In short, it is not good for one person to learn well, but it is good for everyone to learn well. Everyone should practice communist cooperation, learn from each other and help each other, and make progress together, so that we can build socialism as soon as possible.

    争取棉花生产更大跃进
    陕西渭南县红旗公社妇女植棉小组  张秋香
    这些天来，我参加了全国妇女社会主义建设积极分子代表会议，学到了很多东西。刚开完会，又读到了中国共产党八届六中全会的公报。公报中谈到了今年农业生产的伟大成就和明年的粮棉生产任务，对于我是个很大的鼓舞。我一定要在党的领导下，继续努力，在1959年争取棉花生产的更大跃进。
    我们植棉小组共有九名妇女，几年来培植的几亩棉花丰产田的平均亩产量一直保持在千斤籽棉上下。今年培植的四点三亩高额丰产田，截至11月23日我离社时，共摘籽棉七千六百三十三斤，其中一亩已摘二千四百三十六斤，还有一部分没摘完。我们生产队的大面积的棉花也获得了大丰收。但是，我们并不满足于这个成绩，1959年我们要遵照党的总路线和六中全会决议的精神，在棉花生产上作出更大的成绩。我们小组原计划明年高额丰产田深翻二尺（今年是八寸），施肥十万斤（今年三万三千斤），此外还要进一步实行密植，试行棉花育苗。
    1958年省内外来我社参观的共有十二万人，对于所有来参观的人我们都热情地接待，毫无保留地介绍了植棉经验。我还到大荔、富平等六县作了十九次报告。有些社员看我在社内误了很多工，说我只顾别人。我瞅机会就向本社的社员们说：“现在搞丰产运动，不是为的提高一两亩的产量，是为了提高所有棉田的产量。”不管去什么地方，我总是把大家的棉花当作自己的一样看待，只要发现有毛病，当时就给提出建议，改善棉田管理。1959年我们还要大大发扬这种协作精神。我们小组的初步打算是：来年在棉花作务过程中，每做一段，就写个小总结，我们是怎样密植、怎样间苗、怎样打杈的，都写了出来，供各地兄弟社参考。此外，我们到各地参观和介绍经验的时候，还要做到看到问题，就及时提建议，看到好经验，就写上学习。总起来说，一人学好不算好，大家学好才算好。大家实行共产主义大协作，互相学习和帮助，共同跃进，这样才能早日建成社会主义。
