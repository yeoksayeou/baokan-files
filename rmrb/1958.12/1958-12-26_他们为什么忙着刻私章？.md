Why Are They So Busy Carving Personal Seals?
Shandong Jinan Huang Chi

Right after breakfast, the commune's cultural department had just arranged for the mobile seal-carving service team from the city to set up, and a huge crowd of customers swarmed into that small room. Although the morning sun shone through two glass windows, the light inside was still blocked by the people, making it seem dim.

Little Wang from the service team, while opening his tool bag and arranging the small knives one by one, habitually greeted the customers. He first asked the elderly woman in front, who looked to be almost fifty years old, "Auntie, what's the rush for you to carve a personal seal? Is there something urgent?" This one question prompted a barrage of answers from the crowd.

Before the old woman could even open her mouth, a young man jumped in. He had a goat-hair towel around his neck, and his unbuttoned new cotton jacket revealed a bright red jersey with yellow characters: Wu Song Team, No. 08.

"Comrade! You have to carve mine first!" He said it with such confidence, "I just bought a new set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' yesterday—aren't we supposed to learn some philosophy? My handwriting isn't good, so I'm waiting to get a seal carved to stamp it..."

"Hee hee hee..." Several girls laughed, almost in unison, "Is that such a rare thing? Who isn't studying philosophy, who hasn't bought the book!" The young man retorted, unwilling to back down, "What, are your things more important!" One girl flung her braid back with a snap:

"Of course our things are important! Our team is getting paid tomorrow, the first time we're getting paid, how can we do without a personal seal?" "To stamp a book! That's..." Someone muttered softly.

Just as the young man was about to argue, the old woman made an "Um—" sound and said, "Buying books is fine, and getting paid is fine, but everyone is getting paid and everyone is buying books, and the commune hasn't stipulated that everyone needs to have a seal. I think that still counts as a private matter." She moved forward two steps. "Our nursery, next year's...oh, next year's budget, has been made, and the accountant is urging me, saying that the supervisor needs to stamp it before it can be approved...Last time I went to the city for a meeting, I was so busy that I forgot..."

"That's right, old sister!" An old man, afraid that the nursery director would start a long-winded conversation, quickly interjected, and took the opportunity to push forward, "Comrade seal carver, let's put public affairs before private, whoever has public affairs is more important, carve theirs first. As for me, hehe..." He smiled and had already squeezed to the front, glancing at everyone. "This is what's going on, two people from the provincial agricultural science institute came to help us summarize our bumper harvest experience. They said there's a lot to learn from it and asked us to write it down." He paused, seemingly a little embarrassed, "Um—they asked us to break with superstition and write a book. Write it we will, but there's some kind of 'contract,' and I figure it's to make a statute and write a guarantee, right?" Someone laughed upon hearing this; he continued, "Look, writing this thing without a seal, does that look right?"

Someone next to him said, "Right, the old technician's matter is quite important;" there were also those who wanted to argue a bit, but Little Wang spoke up: "Folks! As I see it, everyone's affairs are important. We should meet everyone's needs; otherwise, what kind of Great Leap Forward is this! I'll call right away to see if two more comrades can come, and we'll work hard for a day."

"Good idea!" "You're really capable..." Amidst the laughter, people wrote their names in Little Wang's register. That young man who had just bought the book was still explaining to people how meaningful it was to stamp a newly carved seal on his newly bought book...

    他们为什么忙着刻私章？
    山东济南  黄炽
    早饭后，公社文化部刚把从市里来的刻字流动服务组安排下来，一大堆顾客，就涌进了那间不大的房子。虽然朝阳开着两扇玻璃窗，屋里的光线还是让人给挡住了，显得暗暗的。
    服务组的小王，一边打开工具包，把小刀一把一把地排好，一边习惯地招呼着这些顾客。他先问站在前面的那位年近五十岁的大娘：“大娘，您老这么忙着刻私章，有啥急事呀？”这一问不打紧，回答的是七嘴八舌的一大串人。
    老大娘还没来得及开口，一个小伙子抢了先。他脖子上围一条羊肚毛巾，敞开的新棉衣里，露出大红球衣，上面还有几个黄字：武松队，08号。
    “同志！得先给我刻！”他说得那么理直气壮，“昨天我刚新买了一套毛泽东选集——不是咱也要学点哲学吗？——字写不好，就等刻了印回去盖上呢……”
    “嘻嘻嘻……”几个姑娘笑开了，几乎是齐声地：“这也算是稀罕事？谁不学哲学，谁没买书！”小伙子不服气地抢白道：“怎么，就你们事儿重要！”一个姑娘把辫子向后猛一甩：
    “当然咱的事儿重要！咱队里明天发工资，第一次拿工资，没有个私章，行吗？”“给书盖印！也算……”不知哪个姑娘轻轻地嘀咕着。
    小伙子刚想辩解，那位老大娘先“嗯——”了一声，说道：“买书也好，领工资也好，反正大家都领工资，都买书，社里也没有规定每个人要有一颗印，我看还得算私事。”她向前挪动了两步。“咱们托儿所，明年的……哦，明年的预算，造好了，会计直催俺，说要主管人盖了章，才能批准……前次进城开会，又忙的给忘了……”
      “对呵，老嫂子！”一位老大爷怕托儿所长拉起家常来，忙着插进来一句，并且借这机会向前挤着：“刻字的同志，咱来个先公后私，谁有公事谁重要，谁先刻。我呢，嘿嘿……”他笑着已经挤到前面，向大家扫了一眼。“我是这么回事，省里农业科学所来了两人，帮咱总结丰产经验。人家说，这里面有学问，叫咱写写。”他停了一下，好像有点不好意思：“嗯——叫咱打破迷信写本书。写就写吧，可又有个什么‘合同’，我寻思，是要立个章程，写个保证书吧？”有人听了笑了一声；他接着说：“你看，写这个玩艺，没有个印，像话吗？”
    旁边有人说，对，老技术员的事挺重要；也有的人还想争几句，小王开口了：“老乡们！照我看，大家的事都重要。咱们应该满足大家伙的需要；要不还算啥大跃进！我马上打电话，看还能不能再来两个同志，苦战上一天。”
    “好呵！”“你可真行呀……”在一片笑声中，人们在小王的登记簿上写上了自己的名字。那个新买了书的小伙子还一个劲儿地向人解释，在新买的书上盖个新刻的印，是多么有意思……
