Plant Multiple Fruit Trees to Serve the City
The CPC Kaifeng Suburban District Committee

The Fourth Production Team of Xun Jiao People's Commune in the suburban district of Kaifeng City, Henan Province (including two natural villages), is located in the northeast corner of the city, with a total of 116 households and 516 people; the land area is 2,024 mu, of which 1,385 mu are cultivated. The soil is mostly sandy and bluish sandy soil, which is suitable for growing fruit trees. Before liberation, more than 60 households cultivated fruit trees, but were long restricted by the small-scale peasant economy, having only 130 mu of orchards, planting 2,080 trees.

Under the radiant illumination of the General Line and guided by the idea of serving the city in the suburbs, this team, this spring, with soaring enthusiasm, worked hard and practically, overcoming difficulties in every possible way, and planted 1,840 mu of fruit trees in 30 days, cultivating more than 11,000 pear trees, more than 20,000 grape vines, 3,000 apple trees, 1,600 walnut trees, more than 6,000 jujube trees, 2,800 pomegranate trees, and 1,000 peach trees, accounting for 91% of the total area, with a survival rate of over 95%, changing the natural landscape and realizing orchardization. To protect the good growth of fruit trees, this production team also vigorously carried out afforestation on all sides, building 180,000 windbreak trees. Such large-scale cultivation of fruit trees is a pioneering feat in the suburbs of Kaifeng City, opening up a broad road for the transformation and utilization of sandy wasteland in the entire district.

In the process of creating this miracle, there were difficulties, but under the leadership of the Party, the so-called "difficulties" encountered were broken one by one.

When the team committee began to propose a plan for vigorously developing fruit trees to the commune members, ideological problems arose. "Planting trees makes cultivation difficult," "I'm afraid it will affect production contracts and lead to compensation," "Planting fruit trees is a waste of production, and I don't know what to do in the future!" "I'm happy to plant trees now, but I'll suffer when the communes merge in the future." For a time, there was great resistance. Everyone was unwilling to plant trees. In response to these ideological concerns, the brigade launched a debate to unify understanding. Regarding the question of whether they would suffer in the future, commune member Qin Kezhou said it well: "We are developing, and others (referring to other villages, other communes) are also developing. No matter how the communes merge in the future, we won't suffer any losses." During the debate, by explaining the relationship between immediate and long-term interests, and the principle of predecessors planting trees for future generations to enjoy the shade, the incorrect views of the general public were resolved. In addition, the masses were mobilized to calculate and compare accounts: planting 47,000 fruit trees, three to five years later, with an average income of 20 yuan per tree, the annual income would be 940,000 yuan, equivalent to about 8 yuan per labor day. In addition to supplying the city, they could also eat fresh fruits, and with orchards, they could also develop beekeeping. When the masses generally understood the benefits of planting fruit trees for the collective and individuals, their enthusiasm for production was very high. The team's nursery only had more than 3,000 seedlings, which was far from the planned requirements. They actively adopted the following measures: (1) Digging up wild seedlings, uprooting all the seedlings in and around the village and in the yards, and transplanting them to the fields. (2) Organizing special personnel to go to the city or other villages to help prune grape vines, which helped to prune the branches, which was conducive to the growth and fruiting of the fruit trees, and obtained a large number of seedlings, achieving a win-win situation and satisfying both parties. (3) Strengthening contact with relevant units to seek support. Yuwangtai Park and Lankao Yifeng Forest Farm provided a lot of support, thereby ensuring the successful implementation of the plan.

They always implemented the principle of equal emphasis on planting and management. To this end, ① they organized a fruit tree management professional team, which was divided into pharmaceutical, pest control, and seedling cultivation groups, to specialize in research and management. ② They regularly studied cultivation, grafting, pruning and other techniques. Fan Yongkui's apple tree had not produced fruit in the twenty years since it was planted. After pruning, it yielded more than 60 kilograms this year, giving him confidence in studying and researching technology. ③ They prepared to develop another batch of fruit trees in a planned way. ④ To ensure the strong growth of seedlings, fertilizer was applied once after autumn, and 62 large and small canals leading to the orchard were built to ensure timely irrigation and good growth.

    多种果树  为城市服务
    中共开封市郊区委员会
    河南省开封市郊区驯蛟人民公社第四生产队（包括两个自然村），位于城东北角，全队共一百一十六户，五百一十六口人；土地二千零二十四亩，其中耕地一千三百八十五亩。土质多是飞沙地和青沙地，适宜于果树生长。解放前有六十多户都栽培有果树，但长期受了小农经济的限制，仅有果园一百三十亩，种植二千零八十棵。
    该队在总路线的光辉照耀下和郊区为城市服务的思想指导下，今年春季，全体社员以冲天的干劲，苦干实干，千方百计战胜了困难，在三十天内种植果树一千八百四十亩，栽培梨树一万一千多棵，葡萄二万多棵，苹果三千棵，核桃一千六百棵，枣树六千多棵，石榴二千八百棵，桃树一千棵，占总面积的91％，成活率达95％以上，改变了自然面貌，实现了果园化。为保护果树的良好生长，这个生产队又大搞了四旁绿化，营造防风林十八万棵。这样大规模的栽培果树，是开封市郊区的一项创举，给全区改造和利用沙荒开辟了一条广阔道路。
    在创造这一奇迹的过程中，不是没有遇着困难的，但他们在党的领导下，碰到的所谓“困难”，都一个一个的被打破了。
    当队委开始向社员提出大力发展果树规划时，思想问题就来了，“种上树不好耕种”，“怕影响包产赔产”，“种果树净耽误生产，还不知道将来咋办哩！”“现在种树高兴，将来并社吃亏。”一时阻力很大。派谁去栽树，都表示不愿干。针对这种思想顾虑，大队开展辩论，统一认识。对将来会不会吃亏的问题，社员秦克州说得好：“咱发展，人家（指外村、外社）也发展，往后不管咋并社，一点亏也不会吃”。在辩论当中，由于说明了眼前利益和长远利益的关系，及前人种树，后人乘凉的道理，解决了一般人的不正确看法。此外，还发动群众算账对比：栽上四万七千棵果树，三五年后，平均一棵收入二十元，一年即可收入九十四万元，每个劳动日即合八元左右。除了供应城市外，自己还可吃上新鲜的果子，有了果园还可发展饲养蜜蜂。当群众普遍弄清楚栽种果树对集体和个人的好处以后，生产积极性很高。该队苗圃树苗只有三千余棵，与规划要求相差很大，他们就积极采取：（1）挖野生苗，将村里、村外、院内的树苗全部起出来，移植到地里。（2）组织专人进城或去外村帮助修剪葡萄，既帮助剪了枝，有利于果树的生长结果，又得到大批苗本，一举两得，双方满意。（3）加强和有关单位联系求得支援，禹王台公园，兰考仪封林场，都给了很多的支援，从而保证规划圆满实现。
    他们始终贯彻了栽和管并重的原则。为此，①组织果树管理专业队，下分制药、治虫、育苗等小组，专职进行研究管理工作。②定期学习栽培、嫁接、修剪等技术。范永奎的一棵苹果树，从种上至今二十年就没结果。经过修剪今年就结六十多斤，给学习钻研技术树立了信心。③有准备有计划的再发展一批果树。④为保证幼苗生长粗壮，在秋后均追施一次肥料，同时又修了通往果园的大小渠道六十二条，保证适时灌溉，生长良好。
