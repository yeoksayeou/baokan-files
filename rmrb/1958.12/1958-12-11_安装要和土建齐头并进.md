    Installation Must Keep Pace with Civil Engineering
    In large-scale industrial capital construction, civil engineering has adopted rapid construction methods, leading to rapid development in construction progress. Workshops that used to take half a year or a year to complete are now being built in dozens of days, or even just dozens of hours. However, in installation engineering, many places are still in the pilot stage, and some places haven't even started pilot work. As a result, the installation of machinery, electrical equipment, and other equipment in factories is still proceeding at a slower pace.
    Can an overall construction project, where one part advances at a rapid pace while another part progresses at a slower pace, meet the needs of national construction? Obviously not. It's like walking, which requires two legs. If one leg is sound and the other is lame, even if the sound leg can move swiftly, its speed will be limited by the hindrance of the lame leg.
    Currently, the "small indigenous groups" in steelmaking are developing into "small modern groups," and various regions are establishing a number of medium and small-sized iron and steel bases in the short term. Next year, the scale of industrial capital construction in other areas will also be very large, and modern things will become more and more numerous. The task of installing machinery, electrical equipment, and other equipment in capital construction will also increase day by day. This situation requires that civil engineering and installation must leap forward simultaneously to meet the needs of national construction.
    Some people say that installation work is technically much more complex than civil engineering, and it is impossible to achieve rapid construction in installation as in civil engineering. Facts have refuted this argument. Lanzhou Chemical Plant is a large and "modern" enterprise. The plant has a total of 53,000 tons of process equipment to be installed, and there are particularly many high-temperature and high-pressure devices with very strict technical requirements. Because this plant launched a mass movement during the Great Leap Forward and implemented rapid construction of civil engineering and installation, progressing side by side, it was put into production only one year and two months after the installation of process equipment began, and the project quality was very good. However, the Jilin Chemical Plant, which is of the same scale, took two years and three months to complete construction and put into production. One plant was nearly a year ahead, and the other was a year behind. For national production, it is obviously in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical to put into production one year earlier and create wealth for the country.
    Rapid construction in civil engineering and installation must emphasize overall collaboration. This is the large-scale collaboration of dozens of trades such as machinery, electrical, pipeline, instrumentation, concrete, steel bars, and hoisting. In the past, the civil engineering side emphasized the importance of civil engineering, while the installation side emphasized installation as the main focus. This highlighted oneself, inevitably neglecting others, resulting in mutual wrangling and affecting the construction period. Therefore, in carrying out rapid construction, the civil engineering and installation departments should establish a unified construction headquarters under the collective leadership of the Party committee, with unified planning, unified scheduling, and comprehensive large-scale collaboration, to strive for the early completion of the factory and its early commissioning.
    Simultaneously and comprehensively promoting rapid construction in civil engineering and installation is the inevitable trend of the Great Leap Forward in industrial capital construction. May the ten major experiences of rapid installation summarized by the Ministry of Construction Engineering bear fruitful results throughout the country.

### 安装要和土建齐头并进

    安装要和土建齐头并进
    在大规模工业基本建设中，由于土木建筑工程推行了快速施工，建设进度飞速发展。过去要半年、一年完工的一个车间，现在数十天、甚至只要数十小时就建筑起来了。但是，在安装工程中，很多地方还停留在试点阶段，有些地方甚至连试点工作还没有开展。以致厂房里的机、电、设备等安装工程仍然按着较慢的速度进行。
    一个整体建设，一部分以飞快的速度前进，而另一部分则以较慢的速度前进，能不能适应国家建设的需要呢？显然不能。好比走路必须两条腿一样，如果一条腿是健全的，而另一条是跛足的，纵然健全的腿能快步如飞，但因跛足的牵制，那末，它的速度也是有限的。
    当前，炼钢炼铁中的“小土群”正在向“小洋群”发展，各地要在短期内建立一批中、小型的钢铁基地。明年，其它方面的工业基本建设规模也很大，现代化的东西将愈来愈多，基本建设中机、电、设备的安装任务，也将与日俱增。这种形势，要求土建、安装必须同时跃进，才能赶上国家建设的需要。
    有人说，安装工作要比土建在技术上复杂得多，要求安装和土建同样进行快速施工是办不到的。事实否定了这种论调。兰州化工厂是一座既大且“洋”的企业，全厂安装的工艺设备共达五万三千吨之多，技术要求非常严格的高温高压装置特别多；这个厂由于在大跃进中大搞群众运动，推行了土建、安装快速施工，齐头并进。从开始工艺设备的安装以来，只经过一年二个月时间就投入生产，工程质量很好。而同样规模的吉林化工厂却用了二年三个月时间才建成生产。这两个厂，一个提前将近一年，另一个则拖后一年，对国家生产来说显然提前一年投入生产为国家创造财富是符合多快好省的。
    土建和安装的快速施工一定要强调全面协作。这就是机、电、管道、仪表、混凝土、钢筋、起重等数十工种的大协作。过去，土建方面强调土建重要，安装方面则强调以安装为主，这样突出了自己，势必疏忽了别人，结果相互扯皮，影响工期。因此，在大搞快速施工中，土建、安装两部分应当在党委的集体领导下，建立统一施工指挥部，统一计划，统一调度，实行全面大协作，为工厂提前建成及早投入生产而奋斗。
    土建和安装中同时全面地推行快速施工，是工业基本建设大跃进的必然趋势，愿建筑工程部所总结的快速安装十大经验，在全国各地结出丰硕之果。
