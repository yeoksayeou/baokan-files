Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 2nd. The four railway trunk lines in Sichuan Province connecting to neighboring provinces—Chengdu-Kunming, Neijiang-Kunming, Sichuan (Chengdu)-Henan (Xinyang), and Sichuan (Chongqing)-Guizhou (Guiyang)—have entered the stage of full-scale construction.

The construction of these four railways is extremely arduous. For example, in the Sichuan section of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway alone, more than 1,400 bridges and over 60 kilometers of tunnels need to be built. The southern section of the Sichuan-Henan Railway passes through mountainous and hilly areas, with stone works accounting for more than 60% of the entire project. It is necessary to cross major rivers such as the Tuo River and the Fu River, and build many large bridges. The Yibin to Weining section of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway passes through many unexplored mountain areas, where transportation is extremely inconvenient and the hydrological and geological conditions are very complex. However, thanks to the earnest implementation of the principle of "the whole Party and the whole people running railways," and under the specific leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the special districts and counties along the railway lines cooperated closely with the professional railway construction teams to overcome various difficulties. For example, in the construction of the Chengdu-Nanchong section of the Sichuan-Henan Railway, due to the joint efforts of the whole Party and the whole people, the construction preparation work, which usually takes a year to complete, was completed in only about three months. A motor vehicle transportation access road was quickly built, and the construction cost per kilometer was only about one-tenth of the cost of a general new line construction access road. The workers excavating tunnels on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway used their brains to find solutions and recently created a new record of advancing 132 meters of pilot tunnels per day. The bridge builders on each railway line are seizing the dry season to work day and night to rush to excavate foundations and install piers.

At present, in order to accelerate railway construction, the Wenjiang, Mianyang, and Nanchong Prefectural Party Committees have formed command headquarters in the five counties along the Chengdu-Nanchong section of the Sichuan-Henan Railway, with the county party secretaries taking the lead, and organized more than 100,000 migrant workers to fully launch the construction. If they do not understand technology, the command headquarters of each county will plant "experimental fields" to train key personnel. Residents of villages and communes along the line also voluntarily vacated houses, planted vegetables, increased pig breeding, and transferred grain to ensure that the road-building army eats well and lives well.

### 四川通邻省的四条铁路全面施工

    四川通邻省的四条铁路全面施工
    新华社成都2日电  四川通往邻省的四条铁路干线——成（都）昆（明）、内（江）昆（明）、川（成都）豫（信阳）、川（重庆）黔（贵阳），进入全面施工阶段。
    这四条铁路的修建工程十分艰巨。如成昆铁路在四川省境内的一段，仅桥梁就要修一千四百多座，隧道共长六十多公里。川豫铁路南段所经地带，多为山岳和丘陵区，石方工程占全部工程的60％以上，要跨越沱江、涪江等大河，修建大桥梁多座。内昆铁路的宜宾到威宁一段，要通过许多没有人走过的山区，交通极其不便，水文地质情况也十分复杂。但是，由于认真贯彻了“全党全民办铁路”的方针，在省委的具体领导下，沿铁路线的各专区、各县与铁路建设专业队伍通力合作，克服了各种困难。如川豫铁路成都到南充段的修建工程，由于全党全民齐动手，仅约三个月时间，就完成了一般要一年内才能完成的施工准备工作，迅速修成了汽车运输便道，每公里修建费用仅为一般新线施工便道造价的十分之一左右。川黔铁路开挖隧道的职工们，动脑筋想办法，最近创造了日进导坑一百三十二公尺的最新纪录。各条铁路线上的架桥工人们，正抓紧枯水季节，日夜抢挖基础，安砌桥墩。
    目前，为了加速铁路施工，中共温江、绵阳、南充地委在川豫铁路成南段沿线的五个县，分别组成指挥部，由县委书记挂帅，组织了十多万民工全面展开施工。不懂技术，各县指挥部就分别种“试验田”，训练骨干。沿线各乡、社居民还自动腾出房屋、种植蔬菜、增喂生猪、调拨粮食，保证修路大军吃好、住好。
