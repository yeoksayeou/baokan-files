Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 2nd. Amidst the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, over 100,000 housewives in Shanghai have joined social production and neighborhood collective welfare work. This is a significant change in the lives of urban residents.

It is estimated that approximately 600,000 able-bodied women in Shanghai spend all their energy on household chores such as cooking, washing clothes, and taking care of children, which is a significant number. Given the complex urban situation and significant disparities in living conditions in Shanghai, it is impossible to organize all housewives at once. In August of this year, Shanghai began pilot experiments in organizing production, learning, and collective living among residents in various district neighborhoods. Based on the pilot experience, it was decided to first organize the families of the working people. This work is now being carried out in batches in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Shanghai implements flexible and diverse methods for organizing neighborhood women to participate in production. Some process products for factories and participate in auxiliary labor. Some young and strong women also go to stations, construction sites, and factories to participate in steelmaking, road construction, and other labor alongside men. Women who participate in social labor for the first time, stepping out of their small family circles, are spirited and full of enthusiasm. In the Xincheng District Zhangjiazhai area, over 90% of housewives who can participate in production have been organized, establishing eight production and processing groups for sewing, embroidery, electrical switches, vacuum lightning arresters, toys, and pasting paper boxes. Factories provide raw materials and technical guidance. These production groups essentially function as off-site workshops of the factories. Hu Suqin, from the lightning arrester group, initially knew nothing about technology. With the guidance of experienced workers, she learned in just nine days and was able to produce 8,000 screws in seven hours. After housewives in Jiangning, Changning, and Penglai districts were organized to process products for Kangyuan Toy Factory, Kangyuan Toy Factory has extracted nearly a hundred strong laborers from the factory to the steel and machinery industry front in the past two months. The road construction army composed of more than 500 housewives in Jiangning District completed a section of more than three miles of road on wasteland ahead of schedule. When they rode in cars, holding high the red flag awarded to them by the construction site headquarters, driving on the road they built themselves, they were all happy to cheer.

After housewives participate in social production, the collectivization of housework becomes an urgent issue. In the past three months, 1,790 public canteens have been established in Shanghai's neighborhoods, with more than 220,000 people eating in the canteens. More than 2,100 kindergartens, nurseries, and lactation rooms have been established, caring for more than 64,000 children. Many neighborhoods have also established sewing groups and service stations. These collective welfare undertakings are all established by the masses themselves, starting from scratch, and making do with whatever is available.

Many neighborhood canteens are run very well according to the needs of the masses. Women carefully cook a variety of meals that are diverse, popular, and home-style. You can eat in the canteen or buy it home. You can cook it yourself on Sunday, and the canteen can refund oil coupons and grain coupons. Some canteens cook two kinds of rice, soft and hard, and deliver meals to the elderly, maternity women, and patients. Worker Xu Jinmei has six children. In the past, she had to get up in the middle of the night to cook for the children. One cooking was for three meals. Now, with the neighborhood canteen, the children can have hot meals every meal, and Xu Jinmei has enough time to rest. Neighborhood canteens are very popular among the masses. Generally, small canteens have developed into large canteens. The Fulu Street Canteen in Yulin District originally had only seven households joining, but now more than 230 households, more than 1,300 people, eat there.

After housewives participate in social production, it has caused profound changes in social customs. In the past, there were many idlers, gossips, and fights in the neighborhoods. Now, even some old people can't stay idle and are willing to do what they can. Lin Genzhi, a 50-year-old woman in Xiaomuqiao, has a husband and two sons who are working. She doesn't worry about food or clothing. She used to wander around when she had nothing to do at home. Now, seeing that everyone is participating in production, she also actively participates in the sewing group. A new atmosphere of "every family is engaged in production, and every household has no idlers" has emerged in some neighborhoods.

    上海居民生活的重要变化
    十万家庭妇女参加社会劳动
    新华社上海2日电  在工农业生产大跃进中，上海已有十多万家庭妇女参加社会生产和里弄集体福利工作，这是城市人民生活的一个重要变化。
    据估计，上海约有六十万青壮年妇女把自己的全部精力花费在烧饭，洗衣服，带孩子的家务中，这是一个很大的数目。由于上海城市情况复杂，生活悬殊很大，不可能一下子把所有家庭妇女都组织起来。今年8月，上海开始在各区里弄居民中进行组织生产、组织学习、组织集体生活的典型试验。根据试点经验，决定首先把劳动人民的家属组织起来。现在这一工作正在有计划有步骤地分批进行。
    上海市组织里弄妇女参加生产的方式灵活而多样。有的为工厂加工产品和参加辅助劳动。有些年青力壮的妇女也到车站、工地、工厂，和男子一道参加炼钢、修路等劳动。第一次跨出家庭小圈子，参加社会劳动的妇女，精神奋发，干劲冲天。新成区张家宅可以参加生产的家庭妇女，90％以上已组织起来，成立了缝纫、刺绣、电器开关、真空避雷器、玩具、糊纸盒等八个生产加工小组，由工厂发给原料，并作技术指导，这种生产小组，实际上起了工厂的厂外车间的作用。避雷器小组的胡素琴开始一点不懂技术，在老师傅指导下，仅仅学习了九天，便能在七小时内制造八千只螺丝。江宁、长宁、蓬莱等区的家庭妇女组织起来为康元玩具厂加工之后，两个月来，康元玩具厂已从厂内抽出近一百个强劳动力到钢铁和机械工业战线上去。江宁区五百多名家庭妇女组成的筑路大军，提前在荒地上修成了一段三里多长的公路，当她们坐着汽车，高举着工地指挥部奖给她们的红旗，从自己修建的道路上开过时，都乐得欢呼起来。
    家庭妇女参加社会生产之后，家务劳动集体化就成为一个迫切的问题。三个月来，上海里弄中已办起公共食堂一千七百九十个，在食堂吃饭的有二十二万多人，建立幼儿园、托儿所、哺乳室二千一百多个，受托儿童六万四千多人。很多里弄还成立了缝纫组和服务站。这些集体福利事业都是群众自己动手，白手起家，因陋就简办起来的。
    许多里弄食堂根据群众的需要办得很好。妇女们精心地把饭菜煮得多样化、大众化、家常化。可以在食堂吃，也可以买回家里吃。星期天自己烧，食堂还可以退给油票、粮票。有的食堂把饭煮成软硬两种，并且给老人、产妇、病人把饭菜送上门。工人徐金妹有六个小孩，过去每天要半夜起来为孩子们煮饭，烧一次，要吃三顿，现在有了里弄食堂，孩子们每顿都可以吃到热饭热菜了，徐金妹也有了足够的时间休息。里弄食堂深受群众欢迎，一般都由小食堂发展成为大食堂，榆林区福禄街食堂原来入伙的只七户，现在已有二百三十多户，一千三百多人吃饭。
    家庭妇女参加社会生产之后，引起了社会风尚的深刻变化。里弄里过去是闲人多，闲话多，打架多，现在连有些老人也闲不住，愿意做些力所能及的事情。小木桥五十岁的林根芝老妈妈，丈夫和两个儿子都在工作，她不愁吃，不愁穿，在家没事便东玩西跑，现在看到人家都参加生产，她也积极参加了缝纫小组。有些里弄已出现了“家家搞生产，户户无闲人”的新气象。
