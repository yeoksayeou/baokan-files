    On the Xin'an River
    Jiang Wei Lin Ping
  The Xin'an River flows long and wide,
  A flotilla of boats sails side by side.
  Day and night they busily transport ore,
  To make molten iron flow like a river once more.
  Transportation is bustling on the Xin'an River,
  Coal and machinery fill the field together.
  Golden grains are everywhere to be found,
  Large and small boats can't carry them all around.
  Xin'an River, a wonderful place,
  Thousands of miles of river, white sails embrace.
  Boats are loaded with the fruits of the harvest,
  Everyone sings the praises of their happy place.

    新安江上
    姜炜  林萍
  新安江水长又长
  船队来往排成行
  日夜奔忙运矿石
  要叫铁水流成江
  新安江上运输忙
  煤炭机械堆满场
  黄金谷粒遍地是
  大船小船运不光
  新安江，好地方
  千里江水白帆扬
  船船满载丰收果
  人人欢唱幸福乡
