Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 2nd. The Bulgarian government issued a statement today saying: "The Bulgarian government, representing the will of the Bulgarian people, supports the Soviet government's proposal to turn West Berlin into an independent political entity—a free city."

The statement said that giving West Berlin the status of a non-militarized free city would be an important step towards normalizing the situation in Berlin and would help to peacefully resolve the German question and ease tensions in Europe.

The statement concluded: "Bulgaria is a member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, and therefore, it considers any attack on the German Democratic Republic or any attack on a member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization as an attack on Bulgaria itself, and it will take action in accordance with its obligations under the Warsaw Treaty and the fraternal alliance of socialist countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 2nd. The government of the Hungarian People's Republic issued a statement fully supporting the Soviet government's proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. The statement said that this proposal made new efforts to resolve the German issue and ease international tensions.

The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published this statement on the 2nd.

The statement pointed out that the German Democratic Republic has always abided by international agreements and made every effort to establish a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany, but the Western countries have illegally insisted on stationing troops in the heart of the German Democratic Republic—Berlin—obstructing the peaceful resolution of the German question.

The statement said that the revival of West German militarism and the establishment of war bases seriously threaten the peace of Europe and the Hungarian People's Republic. If the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, or any other Warsaw Treaty member state is attacked, the Hungarian government will fulfill its obligations under the Warsaw Treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 3rd. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today supporting the Soviet government's proposal to abolish the Berlin occupation system and turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

The statement said: "The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the Soviet government's proposal on the Berlin issue will not only promote the reunification of Germany, but also make a significant contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating peace in Europe and the world. The Republic government fully supports this proposal of the Soviet government."

The statement said that the Soviet Union, faithful to international agreements, has thoroughly fulfilled its obligations in the eastern region of Germany, and has consistently made sincere efforts for the reunification of Germany and world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 3rd. First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Władysław Gomułka, announced in a speech at the celebration of the Polish Miners' Day on the 3rd that the Polish government fully supports the Soviet government's recent proposal on the Berlin issue.

The celebration was held in Gliwice (Katowice Province).

Gomułka said: "The Soviet Union's recent proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city is the inevitable result of the Western countries' consistent violation of many basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement and the Bonn government's implementation of militarist and revanchist policies. All those who cherish peace and do not want to push the world to the brink of war should recognize that the Soviet proposal on the Berlin issue is correct."

Gomułka pointed out that when the West talks about a unified Germany, it refers to the elimination of the German Democratic Republic. He said that no wise and clear-headed person would ever expect that the Soviet Union, Poland, and other Warsaw Treaty countries, which suffered such great sacrifices and losses due to Hitler's Germany's military offensive, would stand idly by and allow others to eliminate the German Democratic Republic. All politicians who realistically consider the issue cannot but recognize that, in the current situation, two Germanys with different social systems have formed, and the German Democratic Republic's proposal to form a confederation of the two Germanys is the only way to unify Germany.

Gomułka continued: "We know very well that the security of the Polish Oder-Neisse border, which guarantees peace in Europe, depends on the security of the Elbe border that divides the two Germanys. Any infringement on the German Democratic Republic is an infringement on our country, on our western border, and on all socialist countries."

    保匈朝波政府支持苏联建议
    美英法必须结束柏林占领制度
    新华社索非亚2日电  保加利亚政府今天发表声明说：“保加利亚政府代表保加利亚人民的意志，支持苏联政府关于变西柏林为独立的政治单位——自由市的建议。”
    声明说，给西柏林以非军事的自由市的地位，这将是使柏林局势正常化的重要步骤，并且将有助于整个德国问题的和平解决和欧洲紧张局势的缓和。
    声明最后说：“保加利亚是华沙条约成员国之一，因此，它认为任何对德意志民主共和国的进攻或任何对华沙条约某一成员国的进攻都是对保加利亚本身的进攻，它将根据它在华沙条约和社会主义国家兄弟联盟中所承担的义务采取行动”。
    新华社布达佩斯2日电  匈牙利人民共和国政府发表声明，完全支持苏联政府关于把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议。声明说，这一建议为解决德国问题和缓和国际紧张局势做出了新的努力。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”2日刊登了这一声明。
    声明指出，民主德国一贯遵守国际协定，为建立和平、民主和统一的德国尽了一切努力，但是西方国家却非法地坚持驻军民主德国的心脏——柏林，阻碍德国问题的和平解决。
    声明说，西德军国主义的复活和战争基地的建立，严重地威胁着欧洲和匈牙利人民共和国的和平。如果民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰或任何其他华沙条约参加国遭到攻击时，匈牙利政府将履行根据华沙条约所承担的义务。
    新华社平壤3日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表声明，支持苏联政府关于取消柏林占领制度和把西柏林变成为非军事化的自由城市的建议。
    声明说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议不仅将促进德国的重新统一，而且是对缓和国际紧张局势、巩固欧洲和世界和平作出巨大贡献的重大倡议，共和国政府全面支持苏联政府的这一建议”。
    声明说，忠实于国际协定的苏联，在德国的东部地区彻底履行了他所担负的义务，为德国的重新统一和世界和平始终一贯地作了真诚的努力。
    新华社华沙3日电  波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡3日在庆祝波兰矿工节的庆祝大会上发表演说时宣布：波兰政府完全支持苏联政府最近就柏林问题提出的建议。
    这个庆祝大会是在格来维兹（卡托维兹省）举行的。
    哥穆尔卡说：“苏联最近提出的把西柏林变成自由市的建议，是西方国家一贯破坏波茨坦协定很多基本原则和波恩政府实行军国主义和复仇主义政策的必然的结果。凡是珍视和平的人，凡是不愿把世界推上战争边缘的人都应当承认，苏联关于柏林问题的建议是正确的。”
    哥穆尔卡指出，西方谈到统一德国时，指的是消灭德意志民主共和国。他说，任何明智的和头脑清醒的人也绝不会指望：由于希特勒德国军事进攻而遭到如此重大牺牲和损失的苏联、波兰和华沙条约其他国家，会对这样的统一德国的办法袖手旁观，会允许别人消灭德意志民主共和国。凡是现实地考虑问题的政治家都不能不承认，在目前的情况下，形成了两个具有不同社会制度的德国，德意志民主共和国提出的关于由两个德国组成邦联的建议，是统一德国的唯一途径。
    哥穆尔卡继续说：“我们很清楚地知道，作为欧洲和平保障的波兰奥得——尼斯分界线的安全，取决于划分两个德国的易北河分界线的安全。对于德意志民主共和国的任何侵犯都是对我国、对我国西部边界、对所有社会主义国家的侵犯。”
