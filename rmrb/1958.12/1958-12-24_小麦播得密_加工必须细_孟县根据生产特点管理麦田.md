Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 23rd: Meng County, Henan Province, is strengthening its organizational leadership and adopting new technical measures based on the characteristics of this year's deep plowing and dense sowing of wheat fields, striving for a greater wheat harvest next year.

Meng County is one of the nationally renowned high-yield wheat counties. This year, the county planted more than 350,000 mu of wheat. Generally, the wheat fields were plowed to a depth of more than one and three-tenths feet; dense planting was generally carried out, and the amount of sowing was generally increased from about ten jin per mu in the past to more than thirty jin, and the row spacing was also reduced from seven or eight inches in the past to about three inches. Now, the wheat seedlings have grown to three inches high, and each plant generally has four tillers, which are green, tender, lush, and strong.

In light of this new situation this year, the Meng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to vigorously strengthen leadership. A wheat production increase headquarters was formed by a county party secretary and five county party committee members. Each commune set up a wheat production increase sub-headquarters to be specifically responsible for wheat production increase management. The production management districts and production teams of each commune have organized 609 wheat management professional teams to implement the management system of "three guarantees, two to the fields, and four fixings." The three guarantees are: the team guarantees the high-yield area, the group guarantees the plot, and the individual guarantees the ridge; the two to the fields are: measures to the fields, and yield to the fields; the four fixings are: fixing quality, fixing time, fixing acceptance, and fixing rewards and punishments. From the county to each professional team, they are responsible for everything from planting to harvesting.

They also launched scientific and technological research activities throughout the county based on some new technical requirements put forward after dense planting. The county established an agricultural science research institute, and 38 branch institutes were established in various townships, with a total of 340 researchers participating in the research. Based on the characteristics of dense planting, the masses in various places have come up with some methods to strengthen management. First of all, it is required to apply more topdressing fertilizer, to achieve fine application of coarse fertilizer, ditch application and hole application of soup fertilizer; apply coarse fertilizer near the ground, and apply fine fertilizer far away from the ground; apply coarse fertilizer to first-class seedlings, and apply fine fertilizer to second-class seedlings; and they have come up with more than 20 ways to accumulate fertilizer, such as building thatch pools at the ends of fields, making slurry fertilizer, and smoking fertilizer on the spot. Up to now, the county has accumulated 29.6 billion jin of fertilizer. The county has also built more than 280 indigenous fertilizer plants, producing more than 100 million jin of indigenous fertilizer. Wheat fields have been top-dressed once, and more than half of the wheat fields have been top-dressed twice, with an average of 30,000 to 50,000 jin per mu. They also further carried out garden-style activities, punching one hundred ridges per mu of land, with the ridges as straight as lines and the soil as fine as flour. In order to do a good job in cultivating and loosening the soil, the original cultivating tools were no longer suitable after dense planting. The county modified 35,000 dense planting hoes with a width of two to three inches and more than 17,000 five-toothed hair rakes.

In order to more practically direct the management of wheat fields after dense planting, more than 3,000 cadres in the county managed more than 9,000 mu of "command fields," and each commune member managed one mu of basic farmland. These wheat fields have established a wheat management card system, so that every aspect has indicators, every matter has records, every step has requirements, and every plot has a special person.

### 小麦播得密  加工必须细  孟县根据生产特点管理麦田

    小麦播得密  加工必须细
    孟县根据生产特点管理麦田
    新华社郑州23日电  河南省孟县根据今年小麦地翻得深、播得密的特点，正在加强组织领导，采取新的技术措施，力争明年小麦更大丰收。
    孟县是全国有名的小麦高产县之一。今年这个县共种小麦三十五万多亩。一般麦地都深翻一尺三以上；普遍进行了密植，播种量一般由过去每亩十来斤增加到三十斤以上，行距也由过去的七、八寸缩短到三寸左右。现在，麦苗已长到三寸高，每棵一般有四个分蘖，青葱嫩绿，茂密茁壮。
    根据今年这种新的情况，中共孟县县委决定大力加强领导，由一个县委书记和五个县委委员组成小麦增产指挥部，各公社设小麦增产分部，专门负责小麦增产管理工作。各社的生产管理区、生产队已组织起六百零九个小麦管理专业队，实行三包、两到田和四固定的管理制度。三包是队包丰产区，组包块、人包畦；两到田是措施到田，产量到田；四固定是定质量，定时间，定验收，定奖罚。从县到每个专业队，都是从种到收负责到底。
    他们还根据密植以后提出的一些新的技术要求，在全县范围内开展了科学技术研究活动。县成立了农业科学研究所，在各乡建立了三十八个分所，参加研究的共有三百四十多名研究员。各地群众根据密植特点，已经想出了一些加强管理的办法。首先要求多施追肥，做到粗肥细施，汤肥沟施、穴施；近地施粗肥，远地施细肥；一类苗施粗肥，二类苗施细肥；并且想出地头打茅池、制造浆肥和就地熏肥等二十多种积肥办法。到现在为止，全县已积肥二百九十六亿斤。全县还建了二百八十多个土化肥厂，生产了一亿多斤土化肥。麦田已普遍追过一遍肥，一半以上的麦田追了两遍，每亩平均追三万到五万斤。他们还进一步开展了园田化活动，一亩地打一百个畦子，畦子垅直如线，土碎如面。为了做好中耕松土工作，密植后原来的中耕工具不适用了，全县改制二至三寸宽的密植锄三万五千张，五齿毛抓一万七千多把。
    为了更实际地指挥好密植后的麦田管理工作，全县三千多名干部共搞“指挥田”九千多亩，每个社员搞一亩基本田。这些麦田都建立了小麦管理卡片制，做到方方有指标，事事有记载，步步有要求，块块有专人。
