Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: In order to appropriately solve the current supply issues of certain non-staple foods (including salt and aquatic products) and daily-use industrial products, and to take care of the production of textile mills and cigarette factories, the Ministry of Railways plans to, in the near future (around December 10th), while ensuring the completion of the "Marshal" materials transportation tasks, appropriately squeeze out some transport capacity for the commercial departments to carry out a rush transport.

    The State Economic Commission and the Fifth Office of the State Council recently jointly issued a notice regarding this. The notice stated that this rush transport is being arranged under the circumstances of extremely busy railway transport. The People's Committees of various localities are requested to, in accordance with the spirit of goods waiting for wagons and not wasting the carrying capacity of each wagon, while completing the original transportation tasks, further urge the relevant departments to mobilize the masses and organize various forces to do a good job in concentrating materials to the stations in advance.

    The notice also stated that this rush transport is to alleviate the current situation of insufficient market supply. Therefore, before and after the rush transport, the materials of the commercial departments must still be guaranteed to be shipped as usual.

    铁路部门准备突击运输市场急需物资
    新华社2日讯  为了适当解决目前若干副食品（包括食盐、水产品）和日用工业品的供应问题，并且照顾纺织厂、卷烟厂的生产，铁道部准备在最近一个时期（12月10日左右），在保证完成“元帅”物资运输任务的情况下，适当挤出一部分运输力量，为商业部门进行一次突击运输。
    国家经济委员会和国务院第五办公室最近为此联合发出通知。通知说，这次突击运输是在铁路运输十分繁忙的情况下安排的，请各地人民委员会按照货等车和不浪费每一辆车皮运力的精神，在完成原定运输任务的同时，事前进一步督促有关部门发动群众，组织各种力量，做好物资向车站集中的工作。
    通知并且说，这次突击运输是为了缓和当前市场供应不足的状况，因此在突击运输前后，对商业部门的物资，仍必须保证照常发运。
