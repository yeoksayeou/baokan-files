Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd: Today is the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army. President Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, wrote a letter today to all commanders and fighters of the Vietnamese People's Army and all national defense workers, congratulating them on the great achievements they have made in various fields.

In his letter, Ho Chi Minh said: "While our North is carrying out socialist construction and developing its economy and culture, the henchmen of US imperialism are expanding their armies and preparing for war in the South, dividing our country and oppressing the people. We must work hard to build our army into a strong people's army, a regular and modern revolutionary army, in order to maintain peace and defend the motherland."

General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued an order today to all commanders, combatants, and militiamen of the People's Army, saying that the entire army must carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Army, be absolutely loyal to the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people, and strive to defend the socialist revolutionary achievements in the North as a backing for winning the unification of the motherland, and work together with the people of the whole country to realize the major resolutions of the Party and the government.

To celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the army, many public places in Hanoi have been decorated with lanterns and colored banners for days.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd: The mass movement of labor production and army building carried out by the Vietnamese People's Army is rising and developing in depth. This movement, with "Running Forward" as its central slogan, has now spread from some companies to the entire army.

The officers and soldiers of the People's Army have participated in the construction labor of many large-scale construction sites in North Vietnam and have been called "selfless workers" by the migrant workers on the construction sites. At the Bac Hung Hai construction site, they averaged 14 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day, and some even dug 30 cubic meters, several times more than ordinary migrant workers. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army also helped the people to reclaim wasteland, cultivate land, and accumulate fertilizer. In areas full of thorns in the mountains and forests, it generally takes 70 laborers to reclaim one hectare of land, while they only use 20 laborers.

In terms of military training, many units in the People's Army have completed their military learning tasks ahead of schedule. Moreover, the time has been greatly shortened. An activity of everyone striving to be an "all-around gunner" has also been launched in the artillery.

    胡志明主席在建军节号召越人民军
    建设强大人民军队保卫和平
    新华社河内22日电  今天是越南人民军建军十四周年纪念日。胡志明主席今天代表越南劳动党和政府写信给越南人民军全体指战员和全体国防工作人员，祝贺他们在各方面所取得的巨大成绩。
    胡志明在信中说：“当我国北方正在进行社会主义建设、发展经济和文化的时候，美帝国主义帮凶正在南方扩军备战，分裂我们的国土，压迫人民。我们必须努力把我们的军队建设成为一支强大的人民的军队，一支正规化和现代化的革命军队，以便维护和平和保卫祖国。”
    越南人民军总司令武元甲大将，今天向人民军全体指挥员、战斗员和全体民兵发布命令说，全军必须发扬人民军的优秀传统，对党的和人民的革命事业要绝对忠诚，努力保卫北方的社会主义革命成果，作为争取统一祖国的后盾，同全国人民一起为实现党和政府的重大决议奋斗。
    为了庆祝建军十四周年，河内许多公共场所连日张灯结彩。
    新华社河内22日电  越南人民军开展的劳动生产和建设军队的群众性运动正在日益高涨和深入发展。这个以“跑步前进”作为中心口号的运动，目前已经从一部分连队而遍于全军。
    人民军的官兵们参加了北越许多大型工地的建设劳动，并且被工地上的民工称为“忘我地工作的人”。他们在北兴海工地上，平均每人每天挖十四个土方，有的人甚至挖到三十个土方，比普通民工多好几倍。人民军官兵还帮助人民开荒、种地、积肥。在山林中布满荆棘的地方，开垦成片土地一般每公顷要用七十个劳动力，而他们只用二十个劳动力。
    在军事训练方面，人民军中有许多单位提前完成了军事学习任务。而且时间大大缩短。炮兵中还展开了人人争取做“全能炮手”的运动。
