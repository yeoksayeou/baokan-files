Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th: The entire membership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people are welcoming the upcoming 21st Congress of the CPSU with tremendous and surging political enthusiasm. While the whole nation is discussing Khrushchev's report proposal on the Seven-Year Plan, party organizations in many regions have held representative meetings to discuss the control figures for the Seven-Year Plan and the tasks of the party organizations. The representatives also put forward huge labor guarantees for the realization of the Seven-Year Plan.

So far, party representative meetings have been held in many border regions, states, and autonomous republics in the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Recently, party representative meetings in other border regions and states will also be held one after another.

At the party representative meetings held in various regions, the representatives unanimously agreed that from the 20th Party Congress to the 21st Party Congress, the Soviet Union has achieved great successes in economic and cultural construction and in improving people's lives. The unity of the party has been further consolidated, and the ties between the party and the masses have been further strengthened. They believe that the Seven-Year Plan can certainly be realized, and the economic and cultural construction undertakings in their regions will also achieve great development in the next seven years. At the party representative meeting in the Stavropol Territory, the representatives pointed out that in the first eleven months of this year, the territory's industrial production plan was completed by 104%, and the value of over-planned production was more than 200 million rubles. Oil extraction increased by 2.2 times compared with last year, and natural gas increased by 2.4 times. The territory delivered two and a half times as much grain to the state this year as in 1953. They also pointed out that in the next seven years, gas production will increase by three and a half times compared with this year, oil will increase by nine times, the total grain harvest will increase by 65% compared with 1957, and vegetables, potatoes, meat, and milk will increase by 100% to 150%.

At many party representative meetings, representatives put forward suggestions on more fully utilizing production potential and better completing the Seven-Year Plan. For example, at the party representative meeting in the Yakut Autonomous Republic, representatives unanimously agreed that the establishment of one of the world's largest diamond mining centers in Yakut during the Seven-Year Plan could guarantee that by 1965, the "Yakut Diamonds" trust's mining volume would be twenty times that of 1958, while the tasks stipulated in the control figures could be overfulfilled without increasing any investment. At the party representative meeting in the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic, representatives proposed that the republic should more than double its total industrial output value in seven years and greatly develop the chemical, petroleum, gas, and non-ferrous metal industries.

While providing suggestions on the long-term plan, party representative meetings in various regions also made plans on how to strive for greater achievements in production and construction next year. For example, Kursk Oblast achieved a bumper harvest of corn fodder this year. In order to achieve an even greater harvest next year, the Oblast's party representative meeting decided that at least 400 quintals of corn fodder should be produced per hectare next year, which is 100 quintals more per hectare than this year.

At the party representative meetings in various regions, great importance was given to the development of heavy industry in the next seven years. At the Bryansk Oblast party representative meeting, the first secretary of the Oblast Party Committee, Petukhov, pointed out that in the next seven years, the state's machine production will triple the current level, and the production of steam turbines and carriages will also greatly increase. New industries such as the manufacture of ship diesel engines and automobiles will be established in the Oblast. In order to increase steel production, many blast furnaces will be renovated.

At the party representative meetings in various regions, many representatives pointed out in their speeches, with a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, that in order to successfully complete the great tasks put forward by the Party in the Seven-Year Plan, it is necessary to closely rely on the working people and tirelessly conduct political and ideological work among the masses in our work.

    苏联全民热烈迎接党代表大会
    各地党组织举行代表会议保证实现七年计划
    新华社莫斯科25日电  苏联共产党全体党员和苏联人民正在以巨大高涨的政治热情迎接即将到来的苏共第二十一次代表大会。在全民讨论赫鲁晓夫关于七年计划报告提纲的同时，许多地方的党组织都举行了代表会议，讨论了七年计划控制数字和党组织的任务。代表们并且提出了实现七年计划的巨大劳动保证。
    到目前为止，俄罗斯联邦、哈萨克和乌兹别克许多边疆区、州和自治共和国都已举行了党代表会议。最近，其他各边疆区和州的党代表会议也将陆续举行。
    在各地举行的党代表会议上，代表们一致认为，从党的第二十次代表大会到第二十一次代表大会这一时期，苏联在经济、文化建设和提高人民生活等方面获得了巨大成就，党的团结有了进一步的巩固，党和群众的联系有了进一步的加强。他们认为，七年计划一定能够实现，他们本地区的经济和文化建设事业在七年中也将获得很大的发展。在斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区的党代表会议上，代表们指出，今年头十一个月内边疆区的工业生产计划完成了104％，超计划生产了价值二亿多卢布的产品。石油开采量比去年增加了二点二倍，天然瓦斯增加二点四倍。今年边疆区向国家交售的谷物等于1953年的两倍半。他们还指出，今后七年内瓦斯产量将比今年增加三倍半，石油将增加九倍，谷物总收获量将比1957年增加65％，蔬菜、马铃薯、肉类和牛奶将增加一倍到一倍半。
    在许多党代表会议上，代表们对更充分地利用生产潜力和更好地完成七年计划提出了建议。例如，在雅库特自治共和国的党代表会议上，代表们在讨论七年计划中将在雅库特建立一个世界上最大的金刚石开采中心时一致认为，可以保证到1965年“雅库特金刚石”托辣斯的开采量等于1958年的二十倍，同时可以不需要增加任何投资就能超额完成控制数字中规定的任务。在布利亚特—蒙古自治共和国的党代表会议上，代表们提出共和国要在七年内使工业总产量增加一倍多，要大大发展化学、石油、煤气和有色金属工业。
    在对远景计划提供建议的同时，各地党代表会议对如何争取明年生产建设获得更大成就也作出了计划。例如，库尔斯克州今年玉蜀黍饲料获得了大丰收。为了使明年获得更大的丰收，州的党代表会议决定，要使明年每公顷土地生产至少四百公担的玉蜀黍饲料，即每公顷比今年多生产一百公担。
    在各地党代表会议上，对今后七年中重工业的发展问题，都给予了极大的重视。在布利安斯克州党代表会议上，州委第一书记佩图霍夫指出，七年内这个州的机器生产将比现在增加三倍，蒸汽涡轮和车厢的生产也要大大增加，州内要建立制造轮船柴油机和汽车等新工业。为了增加钢产量，许多高炉要进行改建。
    在各地党代表会议上，许多代表在发言时用批评与自我批评的精神指出，为了顺利完成党在七年计划中提出的巨大任务，一定要在工作中紧紧依靠劳动人民不倦地在群众中进行政治思想工作。
