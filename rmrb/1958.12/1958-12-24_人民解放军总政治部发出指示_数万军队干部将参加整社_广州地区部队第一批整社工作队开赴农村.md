Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd – The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued instructions requiring military cadres to participate in local commune rectification work.

The instructions stated that the nationwide rectification and consolidation of people's communes in rural areas this winter and next spring is a major political task for the entire Party. Taking advantage of this opportunity, it is highly necessary to draw several tens of thousands of cadres from the entire army in two or three batches to participate in local commune rectification work. On the one hand, it can support local work; on the other hand, it can provide an in-depth understanding of the situation of the people's communes and learn from the experience of local work.

The instructions required political organs of all units to immediately consult with local Party committees to formulate plans for military cadres to participate in commune rectification work, and to send out the first batch of cadres participating in the ten-thousand-person inspection groups in due course. The instructions stated that each batch of military cadres participating in commune rectification should have a designated leader, and after arriving at the commune, they should be organized into groups with designated group leaders. Participants should be military and political cadres above the company level with relatively strong political ideology, and attention should be paid to absorbing propaganda cadres and political theory instructors from military academies. Before departure, short-term training should be conducted (or participation in the local inspection group's training) to study the Sixth Plenary Session's resolutions and relevant documents, as well as the local Party committee's relevant commune rectification policies, guidelines, and work plans.

The instructions also pointed out: Military cadres should take advantage of the opportunity to participate in commune rectification to conduct in-depth investigation and research of a commune in order to comprehensively understand the commune, its work, and its various policies. Military cadres participating in commune rectification can focus on helping to rectify the militia organization and summarize the experience of militia work since the Great Leap Forward.

The instructions required military cadres participating in commune rectification to obey the leadership of the local Party committee, humbly learn from local cadres and the people in their work, appear as ordinary laborers, and integrate well with commune members and local cadres.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 23rd – The first batch of commune rectification work teams from various units under the Guangzhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with local commune rectification teams, arrived in the countryside on the 20th to begin work.

In the work teams formed by various units, cadres at or above the battalion level accounted for a large proportion. Many work teams have medical personnel, canteen managers, teachers, and technicians, preparing to assist the commune in building medical stations, providing welfare services such as meals, and running amateur cultural schools. Some work teams also have film projection teams and amateur performance teams, and some work teams also carry a batch of cultural and recreational equipment and books, preparing to perform for the commune members and help the commune establish and enrich clubs and libraries. The vast majority of work teams are led by responsible cadres at the division and regiment level.

Before departure, all work teams underwent short-term training, studied the Central Committee's resolution on several issues concerning people's communes, and invited responsible comrades from the local Party committee to report on the general situation of the commune and the tasks and methods of commune rectification, and conducted serious discussions. Everyone was determined to not only help rectify the commune well, but also to learn well in the process of commune rectification. A work team from a certain unit put forward the five-good standard of "good commune rectification results, good respect for local cadres, good relations with commune members, good investigation and research and summarization of experience, and good ideological transformation," requiring the complete fulfillment of the commune rectification task.

    数万军队干部将参加整社
    广州地区部队第一批整社工作队开赴农村
    新华社23日讯  中国人民解放军总政治部最近发出指示，要求军队干部参加地方整社工作。
    指示说，全国农村要在今冬明春普遍进行整顿和巩固人民公社的工作，这是全党当前一项重大的政治任务。趁这个时机，在全军抽调几万干部，分两批或三批参加地方整社工作是非常必要的。一方面可以支援地方工作；另一方面可以深入了解人民公社的情况，学习地方工作的经验。
    指示中要求各单位政治机关立即与地方党委商议，拟定部队干部参加整社工作的计划，并把第一批参加万人检查团的干部适时地派出去。指示说，对每批参加整社的军队干部要指定领队人，到公社后要编成小组，并指定组长。参加人员应当是政治思想上比较强的连以上军、政干部，应注意吸收宣传干部和军事院校的政治理论教员参加。在出发前，要进行短期的集训（或参加地方检查团的集训），学好六中全会决议和有关文件，以及当地党委有关整社的方针、政策和工作计划。
    指示还指出：部队干部应利用参加整社的机会，深入地调查研究一个公社，以便全面地认识公社，了解公社的工作和它的各项政策。军队参加整社的干部，可着重帮助整顿民兵的组织，总结大跃进以来民兵工作的经验。
    指示要求参加整社工作的军队干部，必须服从地方党委的领导，在工作中虚心向地方干部和人民群众学习，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，很好地同社员群众和地方干部打成一片。
    新华社广州23日电  中国人民解放军广州地区部队所属各部队第一批参加整社的工作队，和地方的整社队伍一起，20日先后到达农村展开工作。
    各部队组成的工作队中，营级以上干部占很大比重。许多工作队中都有卫生人员、食堂管理人员、教员以及技术人员，准备到公社协助建设医疗站、伙食等福利工作和开办业余文化学校等。有的工作队还有电影队和业余演出队，有的工作队还携带了一批文娱器材和图书，准备为社员们演出和帮助公社建立和充实俱乐部、图书馆。绝大部分的工作队都由师、团一级的负责干部担任队长。
    出发前，各工作队都经过短期训练，学习了中央关于人民公社若干问题的决议，并且请驻地党委负责同志作了公社一般情况和整社任务、方法的报告，进行了认真的讨论。大家决心既要帮助把社整好，又要在整社中很好学习。某部工作队提出“整社成绩好，尊重地方干部好，与社员关系好，调查研究、总结经验好，思想改造好”的五好标准，要求完满地完成整社任务。
