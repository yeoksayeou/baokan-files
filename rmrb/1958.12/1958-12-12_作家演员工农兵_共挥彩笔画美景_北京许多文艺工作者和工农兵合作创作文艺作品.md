Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Many writers, directors, and actors in Beijing who have immersed themselves in the lives of factories, rural areas, and the military are, under the leadership of relevant Party committees, collaborating with amateur authors to diligently engage in various literary and artistic creations.

Among their ongoing projects are screenplays for films, dramas, operas, and Pingju operas, as well as musical compositions. Film director Xie Tian, with the assistance of the Party committee of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, is co-writing a film script tentatively titled "Eighty-Eight Days" with factory employee amateur authors Zhao Xueqin, Ma Jianqun, and lathe operator Liu Jiankun, among others. The screenplay focuses on the factory's creation of China's first internal combustion locomotive. Veteran workers who manufactured the locomotive, as well as their family members, have participated in the creative discussions. The film script "Haidian Flower," which reflects the situation of people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing, is being jointly created by theatrical workers from the China Pingju Opera House, the Party committee of a commune in the suburbs of Beijing, and commune members. Writer Lu Zhuguo and others went to a naval unit on the Fujian front and co-wrote a script reflecting the combat stories of torpedo boats with unit leaders, chiefs of staff, and soldiers. These writers and amateur authors are also creating works reflecting themes such as the mass steelmaking campaign, the integration of education with productive labor, the transfer of cadres to lower levels, the technical revolution, and the cultural revolution.

The important characteristic of this creative method is that workers, peasants, and soldiers are no longer merely "interview subjects" for professional writers, but rather joint authors of literary and artistic works. This is a collective creation method that has emerged with the vigorous development of mass literary and artistic activities. It not only makes creation faster, better, and more economical, but also enables professional and amateur authors to make common progress in political art, so that the popularization and improvement of literature and art can be better integrated on a new basis.

Many writers, when talking about the benefits of this creative method for professional authors, believe that although they have all immersed themselves in life to varying degrees in recent years and have written some works, how to quickly and effectively reflect new things and new ideas that they cannot immediately become familiar with in the face of the rapid advance of the Great Leap Forward is still a difficult problem. The creative method of combining professional authors with amateur authors under the leadership of the Party committee has opened up a way to solve this problem. Some professional authors used to believe that "writing about production inevitably leads to formulaic writing," but through participating in collective creation and under the inspiration of real life and the masses of workers and peasants, they have further realized that productive labor has flesh and blood, and that it is difficult to deeply reflect the thoughts and feelings of workers and peasants if one is divorced from productive labor. Gao Chen, a playwright from the China Pingju Opera House, when co-writing a script about rapid steelmaking with Cao Hongsen, a worker author from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, handed over many key scenes for shaping the image of workers and the production process to Cao Hongsen, or had them discussed by the workers before processing them. Once, when Gao Chen wrote a scene where the foreman's wife brought steamed buns to her husband at the workshop late at night, the dialogue was always dry and tasteless no matter how he wrote it. However, Cao Hongsen changed what the housewife said to her husband to the following: "No wonder people say that you steelworkers even have iron in your stomachs, and you don't feel hungry even if you don't eat for several days." With a simple stroke, the character's personality became distinct.

This process of collective creation in combination with workers, peasants, and soldiers is also constantly improving the collective spirit of writers. Many worker and peasant authors insist on writing in the evenings after intense labor during the day. Like in production, they only seek to write works that are beneficial to the masses and the work, and never consider personal gains or losses. This spirit of selfless labor and a serious creative attitude play a great educational role for writers. This kind of collective creation generally takes the form of co-writing by writers and worker-peasant authors, and each gives full play to their strengths in the process of co-writing. Some are written first by worker-peasant authors, and then collectively discussed and revised. Professional authors try their best to help amateur authors in artistic creation and other aspects, so that the writing ability of amateur authors can be rapidly improved. The myth that "literary and artistic works are unattainable" among amateur industrial and agricultural authors is being broken, and more and more workers, peasants, and soldiers are personally writing, and they are using literary and artistic forms to praise the heroic deeds and communist style of the working people.

Many writers also believe that the leadership of the Party committee is the key to ensuring that works have a high political and ideological level, and can also greatly shorten the creation time. During the process of the China Youth Art Theater co-writing the script "Local Power Plant" with Tsinghua University, some leaders of the Tsinghua University Party Committee participated in the discussion from beginning to end, and provided principled opinions on issues such as more deeply reflecting the struggle between the two lines on the education front.

    作家演员工农兵  共挥彩笔画美景
    北京许多文艺工作者和工农兵合作创作文艺作品
    新华社11日讯  北京许多在工厂、农村、部队深入生活的作家、导演、演员，正在有关党委领导下，和业余作者合作，努力进行各种文艺创作。
    他们正在创作的有电影、话剧、歌剧、评剧的剧本以及音乐作品等。电影导演谢添在长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的党委帮助下，正和职工业余作者赵学勤、马健群，车工刘剑坤等合写以这个厂创制我国第一台内燃机车的事迹为题材的电影剧本“八十八天”（暂名）。制造这辆机车的老工人以至工人家属都参加了创作讨论。正在写作中的反映北京郊区人民公社情况的电影剧本“海淀花”，是中国评剧院戏剧工作者和北京市郊区一个公社的党委以及社员们共同创作的。作家陆柱国等到福建前线海军某部同部队首长、参谋长以及战士们合写了一部反映鱼雷快艇战斗故事的剧本。这些作家和业余作者们正在创作的还有反映全民炼钢、教育与生产劳动相结合、干部下放、技术革命、文化革命等方面题材的作品。
    这种创作方法的重要特点是：工农兵群众已经不再是专业作家们的“采访对象”，而是文艺作品的共同执笔人。这是随着群众性文艺活动蓬勃发展而出现的一种集体创作方法，不但使创作多快好省，而且能使专业作者、业余作者在政治艺术上共同进步，使文艺的普及与提高在新的基础上更好地结合起来。
    许多作家在谈到这种创作方法对专业作者的好处时，认为他们近年来虽然都在不同程度上深入了生活，也写出一些作品，但是在一日千里的大跃进形势面前，如何又快又好地反映自己还不能马上熟悉的新事物、新思想，仍然是一个难题。在党委领导下专业作者同业余作者相结合的创作方法，对解决这个难题开辟了一条途径。有些专业作者过去曾认为“写生产就难免公式化”，可是通过参加集体创作，在现实生活和工农群众的启示下，他们进一步认识到生产劳动是有血有肉的，脱离了生产劳动就很难深刻反映工农的思想、感情。中国评剧院剧作者高琛在同石景山钢铁厂工人作者曹洪森合写快速炼钢的剧本时，把许多塑造工人形象和生产过程的关键性场面都交给曹洪森执笔，或经工人讨论后再处理。一次当高琛写到工长的爱人深夜到车间给丈夫送馒头的场景时，写来写去对话总是枯燥无味。可是曹洪森把这位家庭妇女和她丈夫说的话改成下边这样：“不怪人家说你们钢铁工人连肚子里都有铁，几天不吃饭也不饿”，简单一笔，人物性格就显得鲜明了。
    这种与工农兵相结合的集体创作的过程，也在不断地提高着作家的集体主义思想。许多工农作者都是在白天紧张劳动后，晚上又坚持写作。他们像在生产中那样，只求写出作品对群众对工作有好处，而从不考虑个人得失。这样忘我劳动精神和认真的创作态度，对作家们起着很大的教育作用。这种集体创作一般采取作家、工农作者合写的方式进行，在合写的过程中双方各舒所长。有的由工农作者先写，然后再集体讨论修改。专业作者尽可能在艺术创作等方面帮助业余作者，使业余作者的写作能力得到迅速提高。工农业余作者中“文艺作品高不可攀”的迷信正在被打破，越来越多的工农兵群众正在亲自动笔，他们通过文艺形式来歌颂劳动人民中的英雄事迹和共产主义风格。
    许多作家还认为，党委领导是保证作品具有较高政治思想水平的关键，在创作时间上也可大大缩短。在中国青年艺术剧院同清华大学合写“土电厂”剧本过程中，中共清华大学党委会的一些负责人从始至终参加讨论，并且在更深刻反映教育战线两条道路斗争等问题上提供了原则性的意见。
