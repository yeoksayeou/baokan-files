Discussion on the division of labor between physical and mental labor

    Physical Labor Will Never Be Eliminated
    He Zuoxiu, Xian Xingchang
    Comrade Wei Gao believes that in a communist society, there will always be a need for purely mental laborers and a division of labor between mental and physical labor. Although Comrade Ren Wei opposes Comrade Wei Gao's division of labor theory, he believes that physical labor will be eliminated in a communist society. Thus, they both arrive at the common conclusion that there is no need to be a laborer who combines mental and physical labor. We believe their opinions are wrong.
    Physical labor will still be needed in a communist society
    First, we disagree with the idea that physical labor will be eliminated in a communist society. Physical labor will never be eliminated in a communist society.
    In a communist society, a major task for people is to transform nature, and to transform nature, physical labor is needed
    In a communist society, a major task facing people is to fight against nature and transform it. Purely mental labor will not and cannot promote the production of material resources. The task of mental labor lies in objectively and correctly reflecting the laws of nature and social movement changes, and correctly reflecting the relationship between people and people, and between classes and classes, in production labor. However, reflecting the world is one thing, and transforming the world is another. Only when the fruits of wisdom are grasped by laborers who produce material resources can they benefit society. It can be affirmed that to transform the world, one must go through physical labor.
    The design to successful testing of automated machines, the trial production of new products, the creation of new production departments, and the development of new technologies are all inseparable from physical labor
    Of course, in the future, the heavy physical labor that people engage in will be gradually replaced by machines, but we must also see the limitations of this replacement. In a communist society, production will be highly automated, but automated machines are, after all, machines, not people. When designing highly automated machines, designers will try their best to consider various factors that affect production and try to make the machines automatically adjust to these factors. However, in the actual production process, unexpected problems, new situations, and accidents often occur. Obviously, automated machines are powerless to solve these problems. Therefore, human regulation, manipulation, and care of automated machines will be indispensable.
    It must be seen that the possibility of automated program design is built on the foundation of systematic and mature physical labor production procedures. And this procedure only becomes the most reasonable and mature through countless times of physical labor practice and countless times of reforms, and finally, automated machines replace people on this matured procedure. However, even this well-designed automated system still needs to be further improved based on new situations in production and new experiences of laborers. Automation experts cannot design machines based solely on a few formulas and principles in books. They must constantly absorb the experience of physical laborers and then "just press the button" on this basis. But we should not forget that before the "button-pressing" machine is manufactured and installed, the manufacturing and installation work of this machine is still inseparable from physical labor, even quite heavy physical labor. After the "button-pressing" machine malfunctions, the repair of the machine is still inseparable from physical labor.
    Thinking that a communist society is just a "button-pressing" society is a ridiculous fantasy. At least, in a communist society, there is a need to constantly manufacture new products, to develop new production departments, and as society develops, it will constantly raise more demands. The trial production of these new products, the creation of new production departments, and the development of new technologies all require new creation. Here, automated machines are simply completely powerless. The carrying out of these works not only requires physical labor, but even manual labor. At least this is the case in the laboratory and the intermediate factory during the trial production stage. It must be seen that in a communist society, the development path of each new technology from manual operation to machine production, and then to the realization of high automation, will still exist.
    The production of certain material resources is difficult to completely automate and must be done through manual labor
    A communist society will indeed be built on the basis of high production automation, but we should also see another situation. In the actual production process, there is often the production of some material resources with special needs or only a small amount of needs. For the production of these material resources, it is obviously not necessary to equip complex and bulky automated machines, because this would be too uneconomical. In addition, we should also see that some production labors, such as hairdressing and carving, are also difficult to completely automate. In addition, some special precision instruments and equipment, such as astronomical telescopes, must also be produced through manual labor. Human hands are omnipotent. Almost all the most exquisite and precise components are made by hands.
    From this, it seems that the so-called elimination of physical labor in a communist society is undoubtedly a fantasy.
    There is a need for laborers who combine mental and physical labor
    Secondly, we believe that what a communist society needs are laborers who combine mental and physical labor.
    The division of labor between mental and physical labor will only hinder the development of society
    Since physical labor will always exist, is it better to have a division of labor between mental and physical labor, or is it better to combine them? To answer this question, one must see whether this division of labor is conducive to the development of productive forces and whether it has a promoting effect on society.
    If in a communist society, there is still a division of labor between mental and physical labor, that is to say, some people design machines, and others use machines; some people engage in scientific research, invention, and creation, and others apply scientific inventions and discoveries to production. This situation is not conducive to the development of productive forces. Because the people who know the advantages and disadvantages of machines and are familiar with the production process and can raise questions are first of all the laborers who use machines and directly participate in production. And in a communist society, the requirements of production for science and technology reach an unprecedented height, and many problems will be raised at any time. Obviously, only laborers who combine mental and physical labor can adapt to this situation, can raise the problems raised in production to the height of theory, and practically solve them, and further promote the development of productive forces. Conversely, the so-called division of labor between physical and mental labor will only hinder the development of society.
    Mental labor served physical labor in primitive communist society, and it will be the same in future societies
    Mental labor and physical labor are fundamentally combined. In fact, it is difficult for us to imagine that in the process of people's material production labor, workers would be completely ignorant of their labor objects and labor methods. Comrade Ren Wei believes that in primitive communist society, there was only physical labor and no mental labor. We feel this is incorrect. In primitive society, mental labor and physical labor were combined. In addition to obtaining living materials, laborers also created languages, paintings, sculptures, myths, legends, etc., and they were constantly engaged in improving labor tools. How can it be said that there was no mental labor in primitive communist society? Moreover, mental labor in primitive society served physical labor from the very beginning. For example, paintings and sculptures were used to tell others that wild beasts had been discovered, or as signs of labor organizations, and music was produced to coordinate the movements of laborers with a certain rhythm and melody. Therefore, mental labor, whether from its beginning or in future societies, always serves physical labor and is always subordinate to physical labor.
    Significantly, although Comrade Ren Wei opposes Comrade Wei Gao's argument for the division of labor between mental and physical labor, he still advocates a division of labor between "engaging in the production of material resources" and "engaging in the production of spiritual life." This shows that Comrade Ren Wei, in his ideological essence, still advocates the division of mental labor and physical labor. Now, a movement of poetry covering the walls has been launched in rural areas all over our country. These poems and paintings powerfully inspire production enthusiasm. Aren't these talented artists in the countryside the peasants themselves? These facts have powerfully refuted their division theory.
    Some people are accustomed to imagining the production labor of a communist society based on the current production situation. They only see that participating in physical labor takes up the time of mental labor, but they do not see the combination and mutual promotion of physical labor and mental labor, and they do not see how production and scientific research are highly combined in a communist society, and how labor is a kind of "true happiness."

### 体力劳动永远不会消灭

专栏：关于体力劳动和脑力劳动分工问题的讨论

    体力劳动永远不会消灭
    何祚庥  冼星昌
    魏高同学认为在共产主义社会内，永远需要单纯的脑力劳动者，永远需要脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工。人韦同志虽然反对魏高同学的分工论，但是他却认为在共产主义社会中，体力劳动会被消灭。这样一来，他们两位便得出了共同的结论：没有必要作一个脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的劳动者。我们觉得他们的意见是错误的。
    在共产主义社会也还要有体力劳动
    首先，我们不同意所谓在共产主义社会体力劳动会被消灭的意见。在共产主义社会里，体力劳动永不会被消灭。
    在共产主义社会中，人们的一大任务是改造大自然，要改造大自然就要通过体力劳动
    在共产主义社会中，人们所面临的一个很大的任务，便是和自然作斗争，改造大自然。单纯的脑力劳动是不会也不可能推进物质资料的生产的。脑力劳动的任务，在于客观地正确地反映自然和社会运动变化的规律，正确地反映生产劳动中人和人以及阶级和阶级的关系。然而反映世界是一回事，改造世界又是另一回事。只有当智慧的成果为生产物质资料的劳动者所掌握的时候，才能对社会有所裨益，可以肯定地说，要改造世界，必须通过体力劳动。
    自动化机器的设计到试验成功，新产品的试制，新的生产部门的创设，新技术的发展都离不开体力劳动
    固然，将来人们所从事的繁重的体力劳动会逐步地由机器来代替，但是我们也必须看到这种代替的局限性。在共产主义社会中，生产将是高度的自动化，但是自动化机器毕竟是机器，而不是人。在设计高度自动化的机器时，设计者虽然是会尽量考虑到影响生产的各种因素，并且尽量使机器来自动地对于这些因素进行调节。然而在实际生产过程中，常常会出现一些意想不到的问题，出现一些新的情况，出现一些事故；显然，自动化机器对于解决这些问题就显得无能为力。因此，人对于自动化机器的调节、操纵和照管就将是必不可少的。
    必须看到，自动化程序设计的可能性是建筑在系统的、成熟的体力劳动的生产程序基础上的。而这个程序，只有通过无数次的体力劳动的实践，经过无数次的改革，才变得最合理，最成熟，最后才用自动化机器在这个成熟了的程序上代替了人。然而，即使这个已经设计得很完善的自动化系统，也还需要根据生产中的新情况，劳动者的新的经验来作进一步改善。自动化学家不可能只凭书本上几条公式和原理来设计机器，它必须不断地吸取体力劳动者的经验，然后在这个基础上“只需要按按电钮”。但是我们还不应忘记，在“按电钮”的机器没有制造好和安装好以前，这种机器的制造和安装工作，仍然离不开体力劳动，甚而是相当繁重的体力劳动。在“按电钮”的机器出了故障之后，机器的检修也仍然是离不了体力劳动的。
    认为共产主义社会只是一个“按按电钮”的社会，这是一种可笑的空想。至少，在共产主义社会中，需要不断地制造新产品，需要发展出新的生产部门，而且，社会愈发展就愈加不断提出更多的要求。这些新产品的试制，新的生产部门的创设，新的技术的发展，都要求进行新的创造。在这里自动化机器简直是完全无能为力的。对于这些工作的进行，不仅仅需要体力劳动，甚而是需要手工劳动。至少在实验室中、中间工厂中试制阶段是如此。必须看到，在共产主义社会中，每种新技术由手工操作而机器生产，然后实现高度的自动化的发展道路，将仍然是存在的。
    某些物质资料的生产，很难彻底实现自动化，必须通过手工劳动
    共产主义社会诚然要建立在高度生产自动化的基础上，但是我们也还应看到另一种情况。在实际的生产过程中，常常会有一些特殊需要或只有少量需要的物质资料的生产。对于这类物质资料的生产，显然没有装备结构复杂、体积庞大的自动化机器的必要，因为这未免太不经济。另外，我们也还要看到，有一些生产劳动，如理发、雕刻等行业，也很难彻底实现自动化。此外，还有一些特殊精密的仪器、器械，如天文望远镜等，还必须通过手工劳动来进行生产。人的双手是万能的，几乎一切最精致、最精密的构件，都是由双手做出来的。
    由此看来，所谓在共产主义社会体力劳动将被消灭，无疑是一种空想。
    需要脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的劳动者
    其次，我们认为，共产主义社会需要的是脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的劳动者。
    脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工，只会阻碍社会的发展
    既然体力劳动永远存在，那么，是脑力劳动和体力劳动进行分工为好呢？还是合一为好？要回答这个问题，必须看这种分工是否有利于生产力的发展，是否对社会有促进作用。
    如果在共产主义社会中，还有脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工，那就是说，设计机器的是一些人，使用机器的又是一些人；搞科学研究、发明创造的是一些人，而应用科学的发明发现到生产上去的又是一些人。这种情况，是不利于生产力的发展的。因为，通晓机器的优缺点和熟悉生产过程并能提出问题的人，首先是使用机器、直接参加生产的劳动者。而在共产主义社会里，生产对于科学技术的要求达到空前的高度，随时随地会提出许多问题。显然，只有脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的劳动者，才能适应这种情况，才能把生产中提出的问题提到理论的高度，并且实际地加以解决，进一步促进生产力的发展。反过来，所谓体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工，只会阻碍社会的发展。
    脑力劳动在原始共产主义社会就是为体力劳动服务，在将来的社会中也是这样
    脑力劳动和体力劳动根本上就是结合的。实际上我们也很难设想，在人们进行物质生产劳动的过程中，工作者对于他的劳动对象、劳动方式会全然无知。人韦同志认为原始共产主义社会，只有体力劳动，没有脑力劳动。我们感到这是不正确的。在原始社会中，脑力劳动和体力劳动是合一的。劳动者除了获取生活资料以外，还创造了语言、图画、雕刻、神话传说等等，他们也在不断地从事改良劳动工具的工作。这怎么能认为原始共产主义社会中没有脑力劳动存在呢？而且，原始社会的脑力劳动在一开始，就是为体力劳动服务的。例如，图画、雕刻是为了告诉别人发现了野兽，或是作为劳动组织的标志，音乐就是以一定的节奏和韵律来协调劳动者的动作而产生的。因此，脑力劳动不论从它的一开始，或是在将来的社会里，它总是为体力劳动服务，总是从属于体力劳动的。
    有意义的是，人韦同志虽然反对魏高同学的脑力劳动和体力劳动进行分工的论点，但是他却主张仍然有“从事物质资料生产”和“从事精神生活生产”的分工。这说明人韦同志在思想本质上仍然是主张脑力劳动和体力劳动的分裂。现在我国各地农村中都展开了诗歌满墙的运动，这些诗画有力地鼓舞了生产情绪，农村中这些天才艺术家，岂不就是农民们自己，这些事实，已有力地驳斥了他们的分裂论。
    有些人惯于根据现在的生产状况来想像共产主义社会的生产劳动。他们只看到参加体力劳动要占去脑力劳动的时间，但没有看到体力劳动和脑力劳动的结合和相互促进的一面，没有看到共产主义社会下生产、科学研究是怎样高度地结合在一起，劳动是怎样一种“真正的快乐”。
