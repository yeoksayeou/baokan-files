Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 9th. U.S. secret service agencies stationed in Hong Kong have recently instructed a group of pro-American elements to take advantage of the Hong Kong Chinese-funded Industrial Exhibition currently underway to carry out political conspiracies aimed at creating "two Chinas."

A so-called "Republic of China Industrial and Commercial Delegation Participating in the 16th Hong Kong Industrial Exhibition" has arrived in Hong Kong from Taiwan. This "delegation" was invited to Hong Kong to carry out this dirty political activity at the instigation of some pro-American elements among manufacturers, under the direction of U.S. secret service agencies stationed in Hong Kong. These pro-American elements have exhausted despicable methods to deceive the broad masses of manufacturers, abused their authority to carry out this activity, and attempted to use this industrial exhibition to carry out a political conspiracy of "two Chinas" in Hong Kong.

Currently, Hong Kong industrial and commercial figures and Chinese residents have expressed great anger at the dirty political deal being conducted by the United States and pro-American elements. In recent days, many manufacturers have issued public statements denouncing the conspiracy of the United States and pro-American elements. Some manufacturers have even protested by refusing to participate in the exhibition.

Many manufacturers pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities, disregarding the opposition of Hong Kong residents, still allow this "delegation" bearing the banner of the "Republic of China" to enter Hong Kong, which shows that the Hong Kong British authorities are still supporting the political conspiracy of "two Chinas" manufactured by the United States. The broad masses of Hong Kong residents are closely watching this conspiracy activity that violates the interests of the Chinese people.

    竭力进行制造“两个中国”阴谋
    美特务机关又在香港搞鬼
    新华社香港9日电  美国驻香港特务机关最近又指使一批亲美分子，利用香港正在举行华资工业展览会的机会，进行制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋活动。
    一个所谓“中华民国工商界参加香港第十六届工展会代表团”，已从台湾到达香港。这个“代表团”是驻香港的美国特务机关指使厂商中的一些亲美分子，邀请来香港进行这宗肮脏的政治活动的。这些亲美分子用尽卑劣的手法来蒙骗广大的厂商，滥用职权来进行这宗活动，企图通过这个工业展览会，在香港进行“两个中国”的政治阴谋。
    目前，香港工商界人士和中国居民，对美国和亲美分子所进行的这宗肮脏的政治买卖，都表示非常愤怒，连日来，不少厂商发表公开谈话，斥责美国和亲美分子的阴谋，有些厂商还以拒绝参加这个展览会来表示抗议。
    不少厂商指出，香港英国当局不顾香港居民的反对，仍然容许这个打着“中华民国”招牌的“代表团”进入香港，这说明香港英国当局仍在支持美国所制造的“两个中国”的政治阴谋活动。香港广大居民，正密切注视着这宗违反中国人民利益的阴谋活动。
