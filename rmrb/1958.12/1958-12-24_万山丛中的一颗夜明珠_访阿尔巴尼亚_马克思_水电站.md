    A Bright Pearl Among Ten Thousand Mountains
    ——A Visit to Albania's "Marx" Hydropower Station 
    Wu Xiang
      The "Marx" Hydropower Station is one of the most glorious achievements of Albania's socialist construction, and it was put into production on January 11th of this year. Its daily power generation is 400,000 kilowatt-hours. The power grid centered on this hydropower station connects major cities such as Tirana, Mjekës, Elbasan, Stalin City, and Vlorë, thereby rapidly exceeding the electrification level of Turkey and Greece.
    This famous hydropower station is located in the deep mountain canyons of the fierce and turbulent Mati River in the north. Albania is originally a subtropical climate with spring all year round, but the high mountains where the hydropower station is located are covered with snow all year round. It is said that the Turks, who had been rampant in Albania for 450 years, had never climbed these high mountains. In the early days of liberation, this place became a haunt for imperialist-parachuted agents. In order to build a hydropower station in this remote and mountainous area, it was necessary to build a 48-kilometer-long road through the mountains; otherwise, construction materials and mechanical equipment could not be transported at all. When the road construction began in early 1952, the difficulty of the project was quite similar to our Kangding-Tibet Highway in some places. However, the Albanian people, with the bravery of eagles, resolutely overcame various difficulties, opened this road in 1952, and named it the "Road of Light." A car travels along the "Road of Light" upstream the Mati River, and the mountains on both sides are lush green, mixed with deep red maple leaves, which is very interesting. Under the cliffs, the turbulent river water rushes against the rocks. The car road twists and turns in the narrow valley, passing through a cave in one place, and a huge and solid rock is chiseled open in another place, like a pair of pliers. The high mountains and dangerous roads make people sweat.
    The hydropower station's dam is 250 meters long and 64 meters high, and its bottom is 60 meters wide. It is like a copper wall and iron wall blocking the turbulent river water, forming a huge artificial lake with an area of 14 square kilometers. The sluice gate is divided into three layers, which are completely switched by electricity, and can control the water speed and flow according to different needs.
    Overlooking the entire project from the highest point of the dam is truly magnificent. Next to the dam, a small town has appeared, with newly built office buildings, dormitories, and shops neatly arranged. The brilliant sunshine shines on the calm lake surface, and the snow-covered peaks stand solemnly. There are a few black spots on the mountainside in the misty distance, which are the small boats of local residents fishing.
    The hydropower station here seems like a bright pearl among ten thousand mountains!
    The chief engineer told me that building the dam required digging 200,000 cubic meters of soil and rock and pouring 260,000 cubic meters of cement. They lacked sufficient manpower and the necessary construction machinery. At this time, Poland sent excavators, Czechoslovakia sent bulldozers, Hungary sent trucks, Bulgaria sent cranes, and East Germany and Romania also sent various machines. Of course, the biggest help came from the Soviet Union. The entire design task was undertaken by the Soviet Union, and the complete set of the latest mechanical equipment was also donated by the Soviet Union. Because the water flow was turbulent, the foundation of the dam was washed away twice, and it was only completed the third time. The generators had to be hidden in the belly of the dam, and all the 200-ton equipment had to be installed before the dam was built. During these tense and arduous days, Soviet comrades worked day and night with their Albanian brothers. The Chinese cultural troupe also came to the construction site to perform and participate in voluntary labor, leaving their own sweat here. As the chief engineer said, this hydropower station is the crystallization of internationalist friendship.
    From the hillside down to the bottom of the dam, I walked into a tall dome with cranes installed. This is not the machine room yet, the machine room is still below. There are stairs at the entrance at the end of the dome. Going down the stairs, I entered a large machine room with four generators each generating 6,250 kilowatts and various auxiliary equipment; down another level, it was another equally large machine room with four turbines and various auxiliary equipment. The machine room is not only hidden in the dam, but also deep under the water.
    Only eight people are on duty in the entire machine room, and everything is automated. There are various instruments inside that can reflect the various changes in each machine and each part in a timely and accurate manner. There is also a new type of automatic protector, which is a new product from the Soviet Union last year, which can automatically alarm and take measures to solve problems when the machine fails.
    From here, people can excitedly see the amazing growth of Albania's red engineering and technical personnel. The power station has twelve engineers and twenty-eight technicians, and their average age is less than twenty-two years old. The chief engineer is only twenty-five years old. They learned while doing, and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, they quickly learned to master various precision machines. Now Soviet experts have returned home one after another, and all work is handled independently by them. Recently, a larger hydropower station is being built at the downstream of the Mati River, not far from here, in Shkopet, which was collectively designed by Albania's young engineers themselves.
    The appearance of the "Marx" Hydropower Station has inspired the Albanian people's enthusiasm for building a new socialist life. People from all over the country come here to visit in an endless stream, reaching as many as 1,500 people on some Sundays. The farmers in this mountainous area had never even seen a car in the past, and they didn't believe that a power station could be built at all. Later, the road was built, and bulldozers and cranes came in one after another, and the rocks that had remained unchanged for thousands of years were chiseled open, and they also enthusiastically joined the construction team. A farmer named Palenk Ceni stubbornly said that it was nonsense to say that his village, Yursa, would become a lake. He not only insisted on not moving, but also wanted to build a new house in the original place, and no one could persuade him. It was not until the dam was closed and the water was released that he was convinced and happily went to demolish his house.
    On December 1st, Albania's first national opera "Mafika" was staged in Shkodër. This play praises the construction of the "Marx" Hydropower Station. Two passages are written like this:
    "By the Mati River, on the top of the mountains,
    Our singing is loud and clear,
    For a better future
    The working class is working hard!
    We want to build a hydropower station,
    Follow you, our Party
    Following your instructions,
    Let the whole of Albania be filled with light!"
    This is the "Song of the Marx Hydropower Station" loved by the Albanian people. They often use this moving song to sing about their own Party and their bright and happy new life.

    万山丛中的一颗夜明珠
    ——访阿尔巴尼亚“马克思”水电站 
    吴象
      “马克思”水电站是阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设最光辉的成就之一，今年1月11日已投入生产。它每天的发电量是四十万瓩时。以这个水电站为中心组成的电力网，联接着地拉那、梅科尔察、爱尔巴桑、斯大林城、发罗那等主要城市，从而使阿尔巴尼亚的电气化水平迅速超过土耳其和希腊。
    这个著名的水电站，座落在北方凶猛湍急的麦蒂河的深山狭谷里。阿尔巴尼亚本来是四季如春的亚热带气候，而水电站所在的这一带高山却终年积雪。据说，曾在阿尔巴尼亚横行霸道四百五十年之久的土耳其人，也始终没有上过这些高山。解放初期，这里又成为帝国主义空降特务的出没之所。为了在这荒僻的万山丛中建设水电站，必须穿过深山修筑一条长达四十八公里的汽车路，否则建筑器材和机械设备根本无法运来。1952年初开始筑路时，工程的艰险在若干地方颇像我们的康藏公路。但是阿尔巴尼亚人民以山鹰般的勇敢，坚强地战胜了种种困难，在1952年修通了这条路，并把它命名为“光明之路”。小汽车沿着“光明之路”溯麦蒂河而上，两岸山上一片翠绿中夹杂着深红的枫叶，相映成趣。在悬崖峭壁之下，湍急的河水冲激着岩石。汽车路在狭谷中曲折盘旋，有一处从山洞中穿过，又有一处巨大坚固的岩石被凿开了一块，像把老虎钳一样。山高路险，使人捏着一把汗。
    水电站的大坝长二百五十公尺，高六十四公尺，底部宽六十公尺，像一道铜墙铁壁拦住了湍急的河水，形成一个巨大的面积达十四平方公里的人造湖。水闸分三层，完全用电力开关，可以根据不同的需要来控制水速和流量。
    从大坝的最高处俯瞰整个工程，真是气象万千。堤坝旁，出现了一个小市镇，新建的办公楼、宿舍、商店整齐地排列着。灿烂的阳光照耀着平静的湖面，积雪的山峰庄严地矗立着。水茫茫的远处山边有几个黑点，是当地居民打渔的小船。
    水电站在这里，显得有如万山丛中的一颗夜明珠！
    总工程师对我说，修筑大坝要挖二十万方土和岩石，浇灌二十六万方水泥。他们缺乏足够的人力，又没有必需的建筑机械。这时，波兰送来了掘土机，捷克斯洛伐克送来了推土机，匈牙利送来了载重汽车，保加利亚送来了起重机，民主德国和罗马尼亚也送来了各种机器。当然，帮助最大的是苏联，全部设计任务，都是苏联承担的；全套最新型的机械设备，也是苏联赠送的。因为水流湍急，大坝基脚两次都被冲坏，第三次才修成；发电机要藏在堤坝肚子里，不等大坝筑成就要把二百吨重的各种设备全部安装进去。在这些紧张的艰苦的日子里，苏联同志废寝忘食地和阿尔巴尼亚兄弟战斗在一起。中国的文工团也曾来工地举行演出，参加义务劳动，在这里流下了自己的汗水。正像总工程师说的，这个水电站是国际主义友谊的结晶。
    从山坡上下到大坝的底端，走进了一个高大的安装着起重机的穹洞。这里还不是机器房，机器房还在下面。穹洞尽头入口处有楼梯，从楼梯下去，进到一间很大的机器房，里面有四部发电量各为六千二百五十瓩的发电机和各种附属设备；再下一层，又是一间同样大的机器房，里面有四部涡轮机和各种附属设备。机器房不但藏在坝中，而且深入水底。
    整个机器房只有八个人值班，一切都是自动化的。里面有各种仪表，可以把各个机器各个部分的各种变化，及时而又准确地反映出来。还有一种最新型的自动保护器，是苏联去年的新产品，机器发生故障时可以自动报警，自动采取措施解决。
    人们从这里可以兴奋地看到阿尔巴尼亚红色工程技术人员惊人的成长。电站有十二个工程师、二十八个技术员，他们四十个人的平均年龄还不到二十二岁。总工程师只有二十五岁。他们一边做一边学，在苏联专家热诚的帮助下，迅速学会了掌握各种精密的机器。现在苏联专家已先后回国，一切工作都由他们自己独立处理。最近距此不远的麦蒂河下游的希科培特，正在修建一个更大的水电站，这是阿尔巴尼亚年青的工程师们自己集体设计的。
    “马克思”水电站的出现，鼓舞了阿尔巴尼亚人民建设社会主义新生活的热情。全国各地来此参观的络绎不绝，有些星期日达到一千五百人之多。这一带深山里的农民，过去连汽车也没有见过，根本不相信能建成电站。后来路修通了，推土机、起重机一个接一个开进来了，千年不变的岩石被凿开了，他们也热情地参加了建设的队伍。有一个名叫帕仑克·琴尼的农民曾顽固地说，他所住的俞尔萨村会变成湖，是骗人的瞎话。他不但坚持不肯搬家，而且要在原处盖新房子，谁也说服不了他。等到大坝合垅放水，他才信服了，兴高采烈地去拆他的房子。
    12月1日，阿尔巴尼亚的第一个民族歌舞剧“玛菲卡”在斯库台上演。这个剧歌颂了“马克思”水电站的建设。有两段是这样写的：
    “在麦蒂河边，在群山之巅，
    我们的歌声嘹喨，
    为了美好的将来
    工人阶级的劳动热火朝天！
    我们要修建水电站，
    跟着你走啊，我们的党
    遵照着你的嘱咐，
    让全阿尔巴尼亚充满光芒！”
    这就是阿尔巴尼亚人民所喜爱的“马克思水电站之歌”，他们经常用这一首动人的歌，来歌唱他们自己的党，歌唱他们光明幸福的新生活。
