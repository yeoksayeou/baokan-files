Distinguishing Between Two Kinds of Inequality
Cheng Zhaosheng

In discussing bourgeois rights, the issue of equality is often raised. It's said that the distribution system of "to each according to his work" is a remnant of bourgeois right, is unequal, and conditions should be created to eliminate it. Due to a lack of analysis of the nature of this inequality, some people point out that there are inequalities in politics, economics, and culture in our socialist system, as if all differences are inequalities. I believe that if there's a correct understanding of the concept of equality, the essential difference between the inequality in the "to each according to his work" aspect and the general so-called inequality can be clearly distinguished.

The proletariat's understanding of equality can only be the elimination of classes

Marxist-Leninist classic writers have clearly pointed out that the proletariat's understanding of equality can only be the elimination of classes. When the German Workers' Party wrote the elimination of all social and political inequality into its program, Marx and Engels seriously pointed out its mistake, believing that discussing inequality beyond the requirement of eliminating classes would only cause confusion. The elimination of classes that Marx and Engels spoke of at that time referred to overthrowing the bourgeois rule and eliminating the bourgeois ownership of the means of production. Marx once said: The harmony of capital and labor is impossible, so the final goal of the working class party is not the equality of all classes, but the abolition of classes.

Lenin developed Marxism in a new historical period and raised the relationship between the elimination of classes and the elimination of class differences between workers and peasants. He said: The equality we are striving for is the elimination of classes, and therefore also the elimination of class differences between workers and peasants. Lenin raised this question after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, when there was both a proletarian dictatorship and state-owned enterprises under public ownership, and a large number of small-scale peasant economies, which produce capitalism every moment. Therefore, to thoroughly eliminate the bourgeoisie, it is necessary to eliminate the foundation that produces capitalism. The elimination of class differences between workers and peasants that Lenin spoke of refers to the elimination of the difference between the privately owned peasants and the publicly owned workers. He pointed out that there is inequality between workers and peasants when the peasants are still private owners and grain speculators.

After the completion of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union, what was the relationship between workers and peasants? Stalin said that although there are essential differences between them due to the different forms of ownership (ownership by the whole people and collective ownership) and different working conditions, a comradely relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation has been established on the basis of common interests. They are two friendly classes.

Thus, the equality understood by the proletariat is linked to the elimination of exploitation and the elimination of all private ownership. Exploiting classes and exploited classes are unequal, and private owners of the means of production and public owners of the means of production are unequal. When exploiting classes and private ownership are eliminated, although there are still essential differences in the form of public ownership, and therefore class differences have not finally disappeared, there is no longer a problem of inequality, because there is no longer any phenomenon of using privately owned means of production to exploit the labor of others. Equal and friendly relations are established between people.

Without a class viewpoint, one cannot understand what is equality and what is inequality

Why must the correct understanding of the concept of equality be like this? Because equality, like concepts such as democracy and freedom, is not abstract, but is linked to the class interests and revolutionary tasks of the proletariat. Without a class viewpoint, one cannot correctly understand what is equality and what is inequality. Therefore, some people now go beyond the requirements of eliminating classes and say that this is unequal and that is unequal, which is all wrong. For example, some people believe that workers and peasants are economically unequal, saying that one is too high and the other is too low. This view is theoretically wrong and does not conform to the facts in practice. Under the leadership of the working class, China's peasants have firmly embarked on the road of cooperation, worked hard to build socialism, and will go to communism together with the workers. The contradiction between public ownership and private ownership has been fundamentally resolved. They are two very friendly classes. Is it the case that one has occupied the labor of the other? Has one oppressed the other? Who is striving for equality from whom? Obviously, there is no problem of inequality. In fact, a detailed investigation has been conducted and it was found that the average income of peasants is lower than the average wage of workers, but the cost of living in cities is higher than in rural areas. This is reasonable when the two are offset (see Comrade Tan Zhenlin's article published in the People's Daily on May 5, 1957: A Preliminary Study on the Income and Living Standards of Chinese Peasants). Some people believe that the constitution stipulates that everyone has the right to education, but the proportion of children of workers and peasants in universities is still relatively small, which is also unequal. If we achieve what the Communist Manifesto says: Communists only want to change the nature of education, only want to free education from the influence of the ruling class, then there will be no problem of inequality. The cultural revolution is a task that lasts for decades. If we confuse the objective limitations of developing cultural and educational undertakings with inequality, then some capitalist countries have more developed education and a higher proportion of people receiving higher education than our country. Are they more equal than our country? Is the actual situation not exactly the opposite? In capitalist countries, education is to enslave workers and peasants spiritually to capital, which is the most unequal. Our country's education is to get rid of the influence of the bourgeoisie. It can be seen how absurd conclusions can be drawn by extending the concept of equality beyond the requirements of eliminating classes.

The inequality of classes has been eliminated in our country. There is still factual inequality in distribution, but this inequality is fundamentally different from the former

In our country, from the point of view of eliminating class inequality, except that the bourgeoisie still receives fixed interest and still exploits the labor of workers, and therefore inequality still exists, the requirement of equality has been achieved.

However, there is another kind of inequality, that is, the principle of distribution under the socialist system pointed out by Marx in the Critique of the Gotha Program, there is still factual inequality. This inequality still exists after the elimination of bourgeois private ownership of the means of production and the socialist transformation of the individual economy. This is also the remnant of bourgeois right that is often talked about now. This inequality is fundamentally different from the inequality discussed above in terms of the nature of the inequality, the source of the inequality, and the way to eliminate the inequality.

First, the inequality arising from exploitation and private ownership has a clear class nature, is linked to the antagonism of class interests, and is the inequality of one class to another. The inequality of "to each according to his work" does not have the nature of class interest antagonism, is not an inequality between classes, and applying the principle of "to each according to his work" does not have a bourgeois nature. "To each according to his work" is not a principle of distribution in capitalist society, but an economic law of socialist society. First of all, capitalists never receive remuneration according to their labor, but use capital to plunder as much profit as possible without working. Secondly, corruption and bribery are legal means for capitalists to obtain income. Thirdly, capitalists never pay laborers according to their labor. A large part of the total working day is unpaid surplus labor, which is all plundered. Even that is not enough. Capitalists always try to push wages down below the value of labor power.

The principle of "to each according to his work," that is, equal pay for equal work, is the principle of equal exchange for commodity producers. Marx pointed out that this is bourgeois right. What he meant was: This is taken from the bourgeoisie. This principle of distribution cannot go beyond the narrow scope of equal exchange. Compared with the communist ideal, it is a shortcoming. Pointing this out is of great significance, so that we know that "to each according to his work" is a huge progress compared with the old society, but it has shortcomings. Therefore, we do not blindly believe in it, but correctly use it to serve socialist construction, and create conditions to make it disappear. But Marx did not say that this is a right of a bourgeois nature. Apart from taking the principle of equal exchange from the bourgeoisie and applying it to distribution, "to each according to his work" has nothing to do with the bourgeoisie. It is not controlled by the bourgeoisie, serves the bourgeoisie, and is used to develop capitalism, but is controlled by the state led by the working class, serves socialism, and is used to build socialism. It neither reflects the will of the bourgeoisie nor represents the interests of the bourgeoisie.

Second, the root cause of inequality, the former is due to the private ownership of the means of production, where a part of the people occupy the means of production and exploit the labor of another part of the people. The inequality of "to each according to his work" is due to the fact that people's ideological awareness is not high enough, social productive forces are not developed enough, and products are not abundant enough. There is no exploitation of man by man here, mainly due to the objective limitations of the level of production development rather than social reasons. Applying this principle is an objective economic law under the socialist system that does not depend on people's will. It is not artificially formulated under the influence of the bourgeoisie. We can give play to its advantages and limit its disadvantages, but we cannot arbitrarily create or abolish it.

Third, the way to eliminate inequality, the former is to change the ownership through socialist revolutionary means. The factual inequality in distribution is achieved by greatly improving people's communist awareness and highly developing productive forces. And as long as social products are not abundant enough to be distributed according to the principle of "to each according to his needs," distribution according to work will never disappear. Eliminating the former inequality is a fierce class struggle. Eliminating the factual inequality in distribution, in addition to the need to struggle against bourgeois ideology in the political and ideological fields, a large part of it is the struggle with nature.

Not clearly distinguishing between the two kinds of inequality and inappropriately exaggerating the shortcomings of "to each according to his work" will blur the superiority of socialist society

Based on the above analysis, I believe that the distribution system of "to each according to his work" is not of a bourgeois nature. The superstructure must be adapted to the economic base. If it is said that since "to each according to his work" is a bourgeois right, that is, something of a bourgeois nature, then our economic base is socialist (ownership by the whole people and collective ownership), and our superstructure in the aspect of distribution is bourgeois right, it will be difficult for people to understand why the bourgeois superstructure can serve the socialist economic base. Precisely because the system of distribution according to work is socialist, it is adapted to the socialist economic base and plays a positive role in socialist construction.

Not clearly distinguishing between the inequality arising from exploitation and private ownership and the inequality of distribution according to work will inappropriately exaggerate the shortcomings of "to each according to his work" and will blur the superiority of socialist society.

It is necessary to distinguish between bourgeois right and bourgeois ideology of right

But it is also necessary to distinguish between bourgeois right and bourgeois ideology of right. Bourgeois right does not have a bourgeois nature, while bourgeois ideology of right is a manifestation of bourgeois individualism and must be criticized and broken. Bourgeois ideology of right, such as being concerned about fame, status, and treatment; "I don't want to do more than others, and I don't want to take less than others"; dividing labor into high and low, despising physical labor; regarding one's own labor as special, and regarding knowledge and expertise as capital to ask for status and treatment from society; not appearing as an ordinary worker, etc., not only is its source the bourgeoisie, but its nature is also personal interests first, developing the individual, competing for fame and gain, which is completely bourgeois ideology. With bourgeois ideology of right, equal, mutually supportive, and comradely relations between people cannot be established, the relationship between individuals and organizations is abnormal, and even "to each according to his work" is turned upside down into "to each according to his pay," which can only play a destructive role in socialist construction. If this ideology is not broken, not only will a communist attitude toward labor not grow, but it will also generate irreconcilable contradictions with socialist society.

The root cause of bourgeois ideology of right is due to the existence of bourgeois influence, not due to the system of distribution according to work. Of course, the shortcomings of "to each according to his work" cannot but be reflected in people's thinking, such as making people think of grades, material treatment, and comparing people in this regard. But in the final analysis, the fundamental reason is due to the bourgeoisie. For example, it is easiest to make people think of grades and treatment during grade evaluation and awarding, but some people fluctuate greatly and make a lot of noise, while some people do not fluctuate much and have normal emotions. Why is this? The reason is that some people have more serious individualistic thoughts, while others have better ideological and moral cultivation. For another example, why has the phenomenon of competing for fame and gain been greatly reduced after the rectification campaign, even with the same distribution system of "to each according to his work?" The reason is that political and ideological work has been strengthened, awareness has been raised, and the influence of bourgeois ideology has been effectively resisted. Therefore, distribution according to work has a certain influence on people's individualistic thoughts, but it is only the role of external causes, and the fundamental reason depends on the degree of acceptance of bourgeois influence.

Distinguishing between the two kinds of inequality, recognizing the inevitability and necessity of the distribution system of "to each according to his work"; distinguishing between bourgeois right and bourgeois ideology of right, recognizing the harm of bourgeois ideology of right, and striving to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology—these are my opinions.

    分清两种不平等
    程钊生
    在讨论资产阶级法权时，常常谈到平等问题，说按劳取酬的分配制度是资产阶级法权的残余，是不平等的，应当创造条件来加以消除。由于对这个不平等的性质缺少分析，对我国的社会主义制度下存在哪些不平等，有人举出了政治经济文化方面都有不平等，好像凡是差别都是不平等。我认为，如果对平等的概念有一个正确的理解，那末按劳取酬方面的不平等和一般的所谓不平等，二者之间在本质上的区别，就能够分别清楚。
    无产阶级对平等的理解只能是消灭阶级
    马列主义经典作家明确指出无产阶级对平等的理解只能是消灭阶级。当德国工人政党将消除一切社会的和政治的不平等写在自己的纲领上面时，马克思和恩格斯都严肃地指出它的错误，认为超出了消灭阶级的要求来谈不平等，只会引起混乱。马克思和恩格斯当时所说的消灭阶级，是指推翻资产阶级统治，消灭资产阶级的生产资料所有制。马克思曾说：资本和劳动的和谐是不可能的，所以工人阶级政党最后的奋斗目标不是各阶级的平等，而是阶级的废除。
    列宁在新的历史时期发展了马克思主义，提出消灭阶级与消灭工农之间的阶级差别的关系问题。他说：我们要争取的平等就是消灭阶级。因而也要消灭工农之间的阶级差别。列宁是在十月社会主义革命胜利以后提出这个问题的，那时一方面有无产阶级专政的政权和全民所有的国有化企业，一方面有大量的小农经济，而小农经济是每时每刻都产生资本主义的，因此要彻底消灭资产阶级，必须也消灭产生资本主义的基础。列宁所说的消灭工农之间的阶级差别，就是指消灭私有者的农民和公有制的工人之间的差别，他指出当农民还是私有者和粮食投机者的时候，工农之间是不平等的。
    在苏联完成了农业集体化以后，工农之间的关系怎样呢？斯大林说，他们之间虽然由于全民所有制和集体所有制的不同，劳动条件的不同，还有本质差别，但是在利益一致的基础上建立起互助合作的同志关系，是两个友好的阶级。
    由此可见，无产阶级所理解的平等，是与消灭剥削和消灭一切私有制相联系的。剥削阶级与被剥削阶级是不平等的，生产资料的私有者与生产资料的公有者是不平等的。当剥削阶级和私有制消灭以后，尽管公有制的形式还有本质上的差别，因此阶级差别还没有最后消失，但不平等问题是没有了，因为这里再也没有利用私人占有的生产资料去剥削别人劳动的现象，人与人之间建立起平等和友谊的关系。
    离开阶级观点，就不能理解什么是平等，什么是不平等
    对平等概念的正确理解为什么必须是这样？因为平等也如民主和自由等概念一样，不是抽象的，是与无产阶级的阶级利益和革命任务相联系的。离开阶级观点，就不能正确理解什么是平等，什么是不平等。因此现在有些人超出消灭阶级的要求以上，说这也不平等，那也不平等，就都错了。例如，有人认为工农在经济上不平等，说一个高了，一个低了。这种看法在理论上是错误的，在实际上则不符合事实。我国的农民在工人阶级领导下坚定地走上了合作化的道路，努力建设社会主义，并将与工人一道走到共产主义，公有制和私有制的矛盾已经根本解决。他们是两个非常友好的阶级，难道谁占有了谁的劳动？谁压迫了谁吗？谁向谁争取平等呢？显然不存在不平等的问题。事实上，曾经作过详细的调查，农民的平均收入比工人的平均工资低，但城市的生活费用比农村高，两者相抵，是合理的（见1957年5月5日人民日报所载谭震林同志的文章：关于我国农民收入情况和生活水平的初步研究）。有人认为宪法上规定人人有受教育的权利，但是高等学校学生中工农子弟至今还较少，这也不平等。如果我们做到了共产党宣言所说的：共产党人只是要想改变教育的性质，只是要想使教育摆脱统治阶级的影响，那末也就不存在不平等问题了。文化革命是长达几十年的任务。把发展文化教育事业的客观条件限制同不平等混淆起来，那末，有些资本主义国家的教育事业比我国发达些，受高等教育的人数比例比我国高些，是不是它们比我国要平等些呢？实际情况不是恰好相反吗？在资本主义国家，教育是使工农在精神上受资本的奴役，是最不平等的，我国的教育是要摆脱资产阶级的影响。可以看到，把平等概念超出消灭阶级的要求以外，会得出多么荒谬的结论。
    消灭阶级的不平等在我国已经实现，在分配上还有事实上的不平等，但这种不平等和前者根本不同
    在我国，从消灭阶级的不平等这一点说来，除了资产阶级还拿定息，还剥削工人的劳动，因此还存在不平等外，平等的要求是已经达到了。
    但是还有另一种不平等，即马克思在哥达纲领批判中指出的社会主义制度下的分配原则，还有事实上的不平等。这种不平等，是在消灭资产阶级的生产资料私有制和对个体经济进行社会主义改造以后，还是存在的。这也就是现在经常谈到的资产阶级法权的残余问题。这个不平等和上面所谈的不平等，无论从不平等的性质、产生不平等的来源以及消灭不平等的途径来说，都是根本不同的。
    第一，由于剥削和私有制而产生的不平等，具有鲜明的阶级性，是与阶级利益的对抗相联系的，是一个阶级对另一个阶级的不平等。按劳取酬的不平等，没有阶级利益对抗的性质，不是阶级之间的不平等，应用按劳分配的原则并不具有资产阶级性。按劳取酬不是资本主义社会的分配原则而是社会主义社会的经济规律。首先，资本家决不是按照劳动取得报酬，而是用资本掠夺尽可能多的利润，不劳而获。其次，贪污舞弊是资本家取得收入的合法手段。再次，对劳动者，资本家也决不是按劳动支付报酬，劳动日总额中一大部分是无偿的剩余劳动，都被掠夺去了；这样还不算，资本家总是尽量把工资压低到劳动力价值以下。
    按劳取酬的原则，按同等劳动得到同等报酬来说，是商品生产者等价交换的原则，马克思指出这是资产阶级式的法权。他的意思是：这是从资产阶级那里拿来的，这种分配原则不能超出等价交换的狭隘眼界，同共产主义的理想比较，是一个缺点。指出这一点有重要意义，使我们知道按劳取酬虽然同旧社会比是一个巨大的进步，但是有缺点。因此不去迷信它，而是正确地用它为社会主义建设服务，并且创造条件来使它消失。但马克思并不是说这是资产阶级性质的法权。除了从资产阶级那里拿来等价交换的原则，将它用在分配上以外，按劳取酬与资产阶级是毫无关系的。它不是由资产阶级掌握，为资产阶级服务，用来发展资本主义，而是由工人阶级领导的国家掌握，为社会主义服务，用来建设社会主义。它既不反映资产阶级的意志，也不代表资产阶级的利益。
    第二，产生不平等的根源，前者由于生产资料的私有制度，一部分人占有生产资料剥削另一部分人的劳动。按劳取酬的不平等是由于人们的思想觉悟还不够高，社会生产力还不够发展，产品还不够丰富，这里没有人对人的剥削，主要由于生产发展水平的客观限制而不是由于社会的原因。应用这个原则，在社会主义制度下是不以人们意志为转移的客观经济规律，不是受了资产阶级的影响人为地制定的。我们可以发挥它的优点，限制它的缺点，但总不能任意地创造或者废止它。
    第三，消灭不平等的途径，前者是用社会主义革命的手段改变所有制。分配方面的事实上的不平等，则是通过大大提高人们的共产主义的觉悟和高度发展生产力来达到。而且只要社会产品还没有丰富到能够按各取所需的原则来进行分配的高度，按劳分配始终不会消失。消灭前一个不平等是激烈的阶级斗争，消灭分配方面的事实上的不平等，除了政治思想领域内还必须与资产阶级思想作斗争外，很大的成分是与自然的斗争。
    不把两种不平等明确加以区别，不适当地夸大按劳取酬的缺点，会模糊社会主义社会的优越性
    根据以上的分析，我认为按劳取酬的分配制度，不是资产阶级的性质。上层建筑必须与基础相适应。如果说，按劳取酬既然是资产阶级式的法权，也就是资产阶级性质的东西，那末，我们的基础是社会主义的（全民所有制和集体所有制），我们在分配方面的上层建筑则是资产阶级法权，将很难使人理解；为什么资产阶级的上层建筑能够为社会主义的基础服务？正因为按劳分配的制度是社会主义的，所以与社会主义的基础相适应，在社会主义建设中起积极作用。
    不把由于剥削和私有制而产生的不平等和按劳分配的不平等明确地加以区别，会不适当地夸大按劳取酬的缺点，会模糊社会主义社会的优越性。
    必须把资产阶级式的法权同资产阶级法权思想区别开来
    但是还必须将资产阶级式法权同资产阶级法权思想区别开来。资产阶级式的法权没有资产阶级的性质，资产阶级法权思想则是资产阶级个人主义思想的表现，是必须批判和破除的。资产阶级法权思想，如计较名誉地位待遇；“我不比别人多干一点，不比别人少拿一点”；将劳动分成高低，轻视体力劳动；把自己的劳动看成特殊，把知识和专长当作向社会索取地位待遇的资本；不以普通劳动者的姿态出现等，不仅它的来源是资产阶级，它的性质也是个人利益第一，发展个人，争名夺利，完全是资产阶级思想。有了资产阶级法权思想，则人与人之间平等的互助合作的同志关系不能建立，个人与组织的关系不正常，甚至将按劳取酬倒过来成为按酬付劳，对社会主义建设只能起破坏作用。这种思想不破除，不仅共产主义的劳动态度生长不起来，而且与社会主义社会发生不可调和的矛盾。
    资产阶级法权思想产生的根源，是由于资产阶级影响的存在，而不是由于按劳分配的制度。当然，按劳取酬方面的缺点，也不能不在人们思想上得到反映，如使人想到级别，想到物质待遇，使人与人在这方面比较。但是归根结底，根本的原因是由于资产阶级。例如，评级评奖时最容易使人想到级别待遇，可是有的人波动很大，闹得较凶，有的人不大波动，情绪正常。为什么这样？原因在于有的人个人主义思想比较严重，有的人思想意识修养较好。再如，为什么整风以后同样是按劳分配制度，争名夺利的现象则大大减少了，原因是政治思想工作加强，觉悟提高，有效地抵制了资产阶级思想的影响。所以，按劳取酬对人们的个人主义思想有一定的影响，但也只是外因的作用，根本原因决定于接受资产阶级影响的程度。
    区别两种不平等，认识按劳取酬分配制度的必然性与必要性；区别资产阶级式法权与资产阶级法权思想，认识资产阶级法权思想的危害性，努力抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，这就是我的意见。
