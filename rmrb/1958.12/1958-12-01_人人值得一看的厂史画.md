Factory history paintings created by workers in several factories in Tianjin can be said to be a shocking microcosm of the Chinese workers' movement. Starting from the establishment of the factories, some for several decades and others for nearly a century, they fully expose the formation and development of the capitalist system in China, and how imperialism colluded with comprador forces to exploit the workers' blood, sweat, and tears. The working class under the leadership of the Party grew and strengthened in the struggle against the barbarous and despicable capitalism and all kinds of reactionary forces, and finally buried capitalism. The factory history paintings narrate the master status of the working class in the new society, sharply contrasting the changes in the faces of the working class in the old and new eras.

Factory history paintings have become excellent textbooks for the working class to conduct self-education. Older workers recall the past, turning grief into strength. Many young workers who have not experienced the old society shed tears after seeing the factory history paintings, realizing how much blood and sweat of their fathers and brothers is buried in their free and happy land. All selfish and individualistic thoughts seem so humble in the face of the historical traces of their predecessors' struggles. They say, "We can't be unaware of the blessings we have and should be ashamed of being spoiled." Many other working people who visited the factory history paintings also benefited a lot. This kind of concrete illustration of the greatness of the working class with touching images cannot be found in any theoretical book explaining the workers' movement.

Factory history paintings are compiled based on the recollections of veteran workers and reference to relevant written materials, strictly adhering to historical authenticity, with class struggle as the key link and major events as the sequence. However, it does not stop at the naturalistic narration of events. The authors chose typical real people and real events as subjects, and through the interweaving of collective and individual destinies, exposed the crimes of the exploiting classes and portrayed the life and struggle of the working class. Each set of factory history paintings is expressed in the form of continuous paintings, and some of the better works also have the value of single paintings. Therefore, factory history paintings are not only historical documents, but also good artistic creations of the working masses.

The distinct Party spirit in ideological content and the simple, clear, and moving artistic form are the characteristics of factory history paintings. This is the case whether depicting the grand scenes of collective struggles or portraying the images of several people or one person. For example, the painting depicting the workers of Beiyang and Yuyuan textile factories crossing the Haihe River to support the strike of Tianjin Yuda Textile Factory after the strike is impressive. The dark and gloomy sky and sea foreshadow the approaching storm, and a fierce struggle is about to unfold, while the people welcoming the battle are so calm and determined, ready to go all out. Another painting depicting the struggle in progress highlights the tense and fiery atmosphere. The false company commander who came to suppress the workers' movement was hooked by the workers with a fire hook and fell off his horse in panic (see picture). This scene is very impressive. Some factory history paintings have very strong generalization, such as the "Encounter of Master Liang" created by veteran worker Qin Mengzhai: During the period of Japanese puppet rule, Japanese supervisors were rampant and often kicked and beat workers. Once, when Master Liang was working, he panicked when he saw the supervisor entering the workshop, and four of his fingers were sawn off by the electric saw. It is difficult to accommodate these things in one picture, but the author handled it very well. He adopted a symbolic technique, organizing several representative images: the rotating electric saw gear, the truncated fingers, and the kicking Japanese devil, together to achieve a thrilling power. There are also good works depicting the lives of workers after liberation.

The benefits of factory history paintings cannot be fully explained in a few simple words. Of course, factory history paintings also have some immature aspects in terms of performance skills and techniques. I firmly believe that in the continuous creative process, with the close combination of worker comrades and experts, factory history paintings will inevitably have significant progress and improvement.

    人人值得一看的厂史画
    葛路
    天津几个工厂工人创作的厂史画，可以说是中国工人运动触目惊心的缩影。从建厂开始，短则几十年，长则近百年，把资本主义制度在中国的形成、发展，把帝国主义勾结买办势力压榨工人的血、汗、泪，暴露无遗。而党领导下的工人阶级就在与野蛮、卑鄙的资本主义和帝国主义的各种各样的反动派斗争中成长、壮大起来，最后，把资本主义埋葬了。工厂史画叙述了新社会工人阶级的主人地位，鲜明的对比了新旧两个时代工人阶级面貌的变化。
    厂史画成为工人阶级进行自我教育的极好的教科书。年老的工人回忆过去，化悲痛为力量。许多没有经历过旧社会的青年工人看了厂史画后，感动得落了泪，才知道在他们自由幸福的土地上埋藏着多少父兄的血汗。一切自私自利的个人主义思想，在先辈斗争的史迹面前显得是那样的卑微。他们说：“可不能人在福中不知福，摆娇气的应该害臊。”许多参观厂史画的其他劳动人民也受益不浅。这种以感人的形象具体地说明工人阶级的伟大，是从任何讲解工人运动的理论书上找不到的。
    工厂史画是根据老工人的回忆和参考有关的文字材料，严格地遵守历史的真实性，以阶级斗争为纲，以重大事件为序编绘的。但它并不是停留在事件的自然主义的叙述上。作者选择了典型的真人真事作为题材，通过集体的和个人命运的交错配合的描写，揭露剥削阶级的罪恶，刻画工人阶级的生活和斗争。每套厂史画都是用连续画的形式表现的，其中一些比较好的作品同时又具备独幅的价值。因此，厂史画既是历史性的文献，也是工人群众很好的艺术创作。
    思想内容上的鲜明的党性立场和艺术形式的单纯、明确、气势感人，是厂史画的特色。不论是描绘集体斗争的大场面或者是刻划几个人、一个人的形象，都是这样。比如，描绘天津裕大纱厂罢工后，北洋和裕元纱厂的工人渡海河支援的那幅画，阴暗沉闷的天空和海水，预示暴风雨迫近，一场激烈的斗争就要展开，而迎接战斗的人们，是那样沉着坚定，准备全力以赴。另一幅描写正在斗争的画，突出渲染了紧张、火热的气氛。前来镇压工人运动的伪连长，被工人用火钩子一下钩住，惊慌失措的从马背上滚下来，（见图）这一情景给人印象很深。有些厂史画概括力非常强，比如老工人秦孟斋创作的“梁师傅的遭遇”就是一例：日伪统治时期，日本监工横行霸道，动不动就踢打工人。有次梁师傅正干活，见监工进车间，心里一慌，四个指头被电锯锯了大半截。把这些事情容纳在一幅画面上是困难的，作者却处理得非常好，他采用了象征的手法，把几种有代表性的形象：转动的电锯齿轮、截半的手指、踢人的鬼子，组织在一起，达到惊心动魄的力量。描写解放后工人生活的也有佳作。
    厂史画的好处，不是简单几句话可以说尽的。当然厂史画在表现技巧和技术上也还有幼稚的地方。我深信在不断创造的过程当中，工人同志密切和专家的结合下，工厂史画必然会有显著的进步和提高。（附图片）
