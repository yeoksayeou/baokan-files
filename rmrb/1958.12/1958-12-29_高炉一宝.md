　　One Treasure of the Blast Furnace
　　Slag is a kind of discharge produced in the process of blast furnace ironmaking. Many places regard it as "waste" and discard it.

　　In fact, this is a very good raw material, which can be used to make many useful things. Cement is the most important and easiest to make.

　　Cement is currently in great demand and in short supply. Large-scale water conservancy projects will be built this winter and next spring, requiring cement; a large number of new enterprises will start construction next year, requiring cement; transportation construction requires cement for building bridges and culverts; setting up power poles, laying sleepers, and making supports in coal pits all require a large amount of cement to replace wood. Therefore, cement production must be greatly developed in a faster, better, and more economical way.

　　Using slag to make cement is a shortcut. A blast furnace with a daily output of 100 tons of pig iron will produce 80 tons of slag per day, and the slag output ratio of a small furnace is even higher. Now, with the increasing output of pig iron, slag can almost be said to be inexhaustible. In order to ensure the Great Leap Forward next year, we hope everyone will actively utilize this "treasure" of the blast furnace.

    高炉一宝
    矿渣是高炉炼铁过程中产生的一种排泄物，很多地方都视之为“废物”，丢掉了。
    其实，这是一种很好的原料，可以做很多很有用的东西，水泥则是其中最主要的，也是最容易做的一种。
    水泥在目前十分急需，供不应求。今冬明春大规模兴修水利，要水泥；明年大量的新建企业动工，要水泥；交通建设修筑桥梁、涵洞，要水泥；架电杆、铺枕木、煤坑里做支柱，也都要用大量的水泥代替木材。因此，必须多快好省地大大发展水泥生产。
    利用矿渣做水泥，恰是一条捷径。一座日产一百吨生铁的高炉，每天要出八十吨矿渣，小炉子出渣的比例还要高。现在，随着生铁产量的日益增长，矿渣几乎可以说是取之不尽，用之不竭。为了保证明年的大跃进，愿大家都来积极利用高炉这一“宝”。
