Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, December 23rd. Baotou Steel's Coking Chemical Plant's first large coke oven was completed ahead of schedule on the 22nd and started oven heating.

　　On this day, colorful flags were flying high on the tall coal storage tower and the top of the coke oven, and more than a thousand employees held a gathering to celebrate. Chen Shouchong, First Secretary of the Baotou Steel General Company Party Committee, and Soviet experts congratulated the employees at the celebration, and then lit more than one hundred oven heating stoves on both sides of the coke oven together with the coke oven workers. After several dozen days and nights, when the coke oven body reaches a certain temperature, it can be officially put into production.

　　Simultaneously completed or about to be completed with this sixty-five-hole large coke oven are many tall and complex buildings of the coal preparation system and chemical recovery system.

　　The employees who built the Coking Chemical Plant gave full play to the spirit of going all out and aiming high to ensure that the coke oven took the lead over the No. 1 blast furnace. The coke oven body was built with more than 12,000 tons of various refractory bricks, with more than 500 types of bricks. The precision of each brick joint was strictly required, but the furnace builders actually completed this technically complex task in only thirty-seven days. The coal storage tower with a capacity of more than 2,000 tons was originally planned to be completed in four months, but the workers completed it in only three months, and the vertical error of the 40-meter-high tower body did not exceed ten millimeters.

　　The Party Committee of the Coking Plant also mobilized the masses and came up with many temporary measures to allow the coke oven to be heated ahead of schedule before some equipment arrived.

    包钢建成大焦炉
    新华社包头23日电  包钢焦炭化学厂第一座大型焦炉22日提前建成并开始烘炉。
    这天，在高大的贮煤塔和焦炉顶上，彩旗招展，一千多名职工举行集会庆祝。包钢总公司党委第一书记陈守中和苏联专家在庆祝会上向职工们祝贺以后，同炼焦工人们一起，点起了焦炉两侧一百多个烘炉小炉。再过几十昼夜，等焦炉炉体达到一定温度时，就可以正式投入生产。
    和这座六十五孔的大焦炉同时建成或即将建成的，还有备煤系统和化学回收系统许多高大和复杂的建筑物。
    建设焦炭化学厂的职工们为了确保焦炉比第一号高炉先行一步，充分发挥了鼓足干劲力争上游的精神。焦炉炉体共砌了一万二千多吨各种耐火砖，砖的型号有五百多种，每道砖缝的精密度都要求很严格，但是筑炉工人们实际上只用三十七天就完成了这项技术复杂的任务。容量二千多吨的贮煤塔，原计划四个月完成，工人们也只用三个月就完成了，而且四十多公尺高的塔身，垂直误差不超过十公厘。
    焦化厂党委还发动群众，想出了许多临时措施，使这座焦炉在部分设备没有到达以前就提前烘炉。
