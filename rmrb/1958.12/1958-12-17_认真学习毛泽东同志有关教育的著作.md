The implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" has achieved brilliant successes nationwide and continues to achieve even greater successes.

The broad masses of workers and peasants warmly welcome and resolutely support the Party's education policy. However, some who adhere to the bourgeois stand and viewpoint are resistant to the Party's education policy. Many others, though willing to accept the Party's leadership, still harbor doubts about the Party's education policy due to the deep influence of bourgeois educational thought. These facts show that to thoroughly implement the Party's education policy, we must resolutely continue the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads on the education front.

The publication of "Comrade Mao Zedong on Educational Work" provides us with an exceptionally sharp ideological weapon for further studying and researching the directives of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on educational work and continuing the struggle between the two roads on the education front. This is of great significance for raising the theoretical and ideological level of the vast number of educators and young students throughout the country and consciously implementing the Party's education policy. However, this book only offers us some clues for studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works on education.

Comrade Mao Zedong's educational thought is a concrete application and new development of Marxist-Leninist educational principles combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution. The specific educational guidelines and policies formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong during the various historical periods of the Chinese revolution have always been guided by the following consistent themes: education must serve proletarian politics, education must be combined with productive labor, educational work must be led by the Party, and the mass line must be implemented. The directives of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on educational work are the concrete embodiment of the educational thought of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong in the current situation in our country.

Education Must Serve Proletarian Politics

Comrade Mao Zedong has always regarded revolutionary cultural and educational work as an important component of the entire proletarian revolutionary cause, pointing out that "revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture is the ideological preparation for the revolution before the revolution; in the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general revolutionary front." ("Comrade Mao Zedong on Educational Work," page 29. Hereafter, all quotations without specific sources are from this book.) The specific educational guidelines and policies formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong in each revolutionary historical period have always served the Party's general line and general policies at the time, enabling the educational cause to serve the political tasks of the proletariat well. From the General Program of Soviet Cultural and Educational Policy during the First Revolutionary Civil War to the Cultural and Educational Policy during the New Democratic Revolution, all served the people's revolutionary war and class struggle led by the proletariat at that time. Last year, Comrade Mao Zedong stipulated in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education, and become educated laborers with socialist consciousness." This grand policy was formulated precisely to accelerate the completion of socialism and actively lay the foundation for the transition to communism, serving the entire socialist construction.

With the development of the revolutionary situation in our country, Comrade Mao Zedong has always promptly pointed out the corresponding development direction of cultural and educational work. As early as 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "once the landlord forces in the countryside fall, the peasant cultural movement begins." (Page 10) In 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out again: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." (Page 43) In 1955, when the socialist transformation of the countryside entered a high tide, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This incident tells us that the scale and speed of China's industrialization, the scale and speed of the development of science, culture, education, health, and other undertakings can no longer be completely done according to what was originally thought. These should all be appropriately expanded and accelerated." (Page 48) Historical facts have repeatedly proved the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's predictions. This year, when a new situation of great leap forward emerged in our country's industrial and agricultural production, and the communist spirit was vigorously developing throughout the country, Comrade Mao Zedong promptly pointed out: "This fact marks that our country's socialist economic revolution (the part of the relations of production that has not yet completed the transformation), political revolution, ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution are advancing. ... All corrupt ideologies and other inapplicable parts of the superstructure are collapsing day by day. Completely sweeping away these garbage still requires time; however, the trend of these things collapsing is certain." (Page 50) Our current task is to conscientiously study these brilliant instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, work hard, and resolutely carry out the struggle between the two roads on the education front to the end.

Comrade Mao Zedong cares for and loves the working people of workers and peasants infinitely, and pays special attention to raising the political consciousness and cultural level of workers and peasants, cultivating worker and peasant cadres and cultivating intellectuals of the working class. In 1934, in the Soviet area, he said that "here, all cultural and educational organs are in the hands of the working, peasant and laboring masses, and workers, peasants and their children have priority in enjoying education. The Soviet government uses all methods to improve the cultural level of workers and peasants." (Page 13) In 1942, in the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," when talking about the combination of popularization and improvement, Comrade Mao Zedong specifically clarified that popularization and improvement mean popularizing to workers, peasants and soldiers, and popularizing with things that workers, peasants and soldiers need and are easy to accept; to improve from the basis of workers, peasants and soldiers, and to improve along the direction of workers, peasants and soldiers, and to improve along the direction of the proletariat. Improving cadres is also indirectly for improving the masses.

The task of our educational work is to do a good job in popularizing education. Of course, we must never relax the partial improvement, which is not only necessary for building socialism, but also to create conditions for future universal improvement.

While caring about the intellectualization of the working masses, Comrade Mao Zedong also instructed us to pay attention to the work of uniting, educating, and transforming the bourgeois intellectuals. He has repeatedly emphasized that "Our country's arduous socialist construction cause requires as many intellectuals as possible to serve it. We should give trust to all intellectuals who are truly willing to serve the socialist cause, fundamentally improve relations with them, help them solve various problems that must be solved, and enable them to actively exert their talents." (Page 178) At the same time, he also pointed out: Intellectuals must carry out self-ideological transformation in the process of delving into the workers and peasants, delving into actual struggle, learning Marxism-Leninism and learning from society. As early as 1939, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "However, if intellectuals do not combine with the workers, peasants and soldiers, they will accomplish nothing. The final demarcation of revolutionary, non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals depends on whether they are willing to and do combine with the workers, peasants and soldiers." (Page 188) Last year, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out again in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society, and in order to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to transform themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian and communist world outlook." (Page 179) That is to say, it is necessary to shift from the bourgeois position to the proletarian side. This is a fundamental transformation. All intellectuals should strive to complete this transformation. Only in this way can they keep pace with the masses and keep pace with this great era.

Education Must Be Combined with Productive Labor

Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently advocated the combination of education and productive labor. As early as 1934, in the General Program of Soviet Cultural and Educational Policy, he stipulated that "education should be linked with labor." (Page 15) During the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong regarded the unity of the youth in Yan'an and the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, their combination with the workers and peasants, their study of revolutionary theory, and their implementation of productive labor as the direction of the national youth movement. He also advocated that schools develop production undertakings. After the nationwide liberation, school education work achieved remarkable results in carrying out teaching reforms and improving students' cultural and scientific levels; however, for a period of time, school education's separation from productive labor was a directional error. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly criticized this error and repeatedly instructed us that school education must be combined with productive labor, and students must participate in productive labor.

The combination of education and productive labor is one of the basic characteristics of the proletarian education policy. Labor created mankind, labor created human culture, and education cannot be separated from labor. When it came to class society, education was separated from labor, and now they must be combined again. The purpose is not only to develop education quickly, well and economically, to completely complete the socialist revolution, to accelerate the construction of socialism, but also to prepare conditions for the ultimate elimination of the difference between mental labor and physical labor, and the realization of the long-term goal of communism.

The combination of education and productive labor is also a question of the combination of theory and practice. The educational process of combining education and productive labor, I think, is precisely Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice," the "entire epistemology of dialectical materialism," and the "dialectical materialist view of the unity of knowledge and action" applied in educational work. In this way, the entire educational process becomes a process of practice, knowledge, re-practice, and re-knowledge, and becomes a dialectical development process of perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge. This is in line with the objective law of cognition, and therefore the most effective.

Comrade Mao Zedong often teaches us to value theoretical study, but he resolutely opposes studying theory dogmatically and divorced from reality. Especially for young students, it is not enough to only talk about textbook knowledge. It is necessary to talk about reality, teach the truth of reality, and it must be combined with practice. Because "there is only one true theory in the world, that is, the theory that is drawn from objective reality and has been proven in objective reality, and nothing else can be called the theory we are talking about." (Page 133) In schools, good textbooks, whether basic courses or professional courses, should be summarized from practice and proven by practice. Empty theories that cannot stand the test of practice are not theories.

Just imagine: A person from elementary school to university graduation, for more than ten years in a row, always reads, reads, and reads again, recognizes, recognizes, and recognizes again, always engages in some conceptual things, does not let them contact reality, and is separated from the working masses for a long time, separated from productive labor, separated from actual life, how can they cultivate new people who are both civil and military, both red and expert, and are both laborers and intellectuals?

In the past few months, schools have been running factories and farms on a large scale, and factories and people's communes have been running schools on a large scale, which has not only promoted the great development of education, but also initially created some specific forms of combining education and productive labor. The results of practice prove that those that are well combined have a great promotion effect on learning and production. Not only is it of great benefit to the political thought and physical exercise of teachers and students, but also significant progress has been made in academic performance, and it has promoted the development of scientific research work and improved scientific and technological levels. Correctly implementing the policy of combining education and productive labor will definitely improve the quality of teaching, rather than lowering the quality of teaching.

In order to better implement the Party's education policy, we should currently pay attention to summing up experience, rationally arrange the time for classroom teaching, productive labor, and rest, and appropriately combine teaching, production, and scientific research. Full-time schools should still focus on teaching, and labor time should not be too long. We must not only oppose the practice of only letting students read books to death, talk about theory emptyly, and be divorced from reality; we must also prevent the tendency to one-sidedly emphasize labor practice, believing that "practice is theory" and "life is education," thus neglecting cultural and theoretical study.

Educational Work Must Be Led by the Party

Our country is a socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and all work must be led by the Party. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: “The Party is the vanguard of the proletariat and the highest form of proletarian organization. It should lead all other organizations.” (Page 66) The socialist education cause is a component of the entire socialist revolution and socialist construction cause. It is a tool for the proletariat to transform mankind and transform the world, and must be led by the Party in a unified and monolithic way. Experience has proven that, like all the Party's work, education, once it deviates from the Party's leadership, will lose its direction; once it deviates from politics, deviates from production, deviates from reality, and deviates from the masses, the work will suffer losses. Bourgeois intellectuals, considering themselves "experts" and "insiders," erroneously believe that the Party is an "outsider" to scientific research and teaching and cannot lead. Therefore, they often resist accepting the Party's leadership in their minds, but are not convinced in their hearts. However, facts speak louder than words. As an old teacher from a higher education institution recently said: He went from not believing in the Party's leadership to believing that the Party can lead everything. This went through the following processes: (1) The Communist Party can fight wars, but it may not be able to lead economic work; (2) The Party can lead production, but it cannot lead higher education institutions; (3) The Party can lead higher education institutions, but it can only manage administration and cannot manage teaching; (4) The Party can lead teaching work, but it cannot lead scientific research work; (5) Only recently did he realize that the Party can also lead scientific research work, and lead it very well. This change in position and viewpoint is precisely a process of self-transformation for a bourgeois intellectual.

Educational Work Must Implement the Mass Line

In order to implement the Party's leadership, we must follow the mass line. The mass line is the fundamental line of the Party's work. Comrade Mao Zedong believes that the revolutionary education cause is the cause of the people themselves. Therefore, it is not enough for the government to only run education for the masses. We must also follow the mass line and mobilize the masses to run it themselves. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All these must also be combined with political mobilization of the people's strength and government decrees. The main thing lies in mobilizing the people to educate themselves, and the government gives appropriate guidance and adjustment, and gives possible material assistance. It is not enough to rely solely on a few schools, newspapers, etc. run by the government with limited financial resources to complete the great task of improving national culture and national consciousness." (Page 33)

Years of experience have repeatedly proven that when we one-sidedly emphasize state-run schools and "expert"-run schools, and one-sidedly emphasize running so-called regular schools, we restrict the masses' ability to run schools, and the development of education is relatively slow, and it cannot meet the needs of the masses. When we pay attention to mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to run schools themselves according to the different needs of the masses, in addition to state-run schools, the education cause will develop vigorously, and will be welcomed by the broad masses of workers and peasants. Especially in the past six months or so, the unprecedented great leap forward in the field of education is precisely the result of implementing the mass line, mobilizing the whole Party and the whole people to run education on a large scale, and carrying out education reform on a large scale. Therefore, if we want to do a good job in the education of workers and peasants, we must face the masses and adopt the working method of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Only by representing the masses can we educate the masses, and only by being students of the masses can we be teachers of the masses. If they regard themselves as the masters of the masses, as aristocrats who are high above the 'lower class', then no matter how great their talents are, they are not needed by the masses, and their work has no future." (Page 85) These words were said sixteen years ago, and they have even more practical significance now. In our ranks of those engaged in socialist and communist education, there are still many people with this kind of aristocratic ideology and bureaucratic style. They stand above the masses, act pretentiously, and gesticulate; they watch the mass movement with cold eyes and nitpick. This is even more unacceptable. The reason why bureaucracy and subjectivism run into snags everywhere, and the reason why experts and scholars are cold and lonely in front of students and feel isolated is precisely because they are separated from the masses.

Due to the further strengthening of the leadership of education work by the Party committees at all levels, putting politics in command, criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and dogmatism, breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, resolutely implementing the Party's education work policy, adopting the working methods of the mass line of "three combinations" and "six concurrents," and mobilizing the whole Party and the whole people to run education on a large scale. In addition to the governments at all levels running universities and secondary schools on a large scale, rural people's communes and urban industrial and mining enterprises, under the leadership of the Party committees, mobilize the masses and organize themselves to run primary schools, middle schools, agricultural middle schools and other vocational schools on a large scale. In just a few months, unprecedented and huge achievements have been made in eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people and popularizing primary education. On the basis of eliminating illiteracy, cultural and technical schools, red and expert schools, and red and expert universities are run on a large scale. Secretaries take the lead, the capable are teachers, people teach each other, learn from each other, and combine politics, culture, and technology. It is truly a scene of ten thousand horses galloping and a hundred flowers blooming. The original universities and secondary schools have also achieved remarkable results in implementing the Party's education policy. Under the leadership of the Party committees, they have run factories and farms on a large scale and invested in the great shock movement of running iron and steel, and the ideological outlook of teachers and students has been renewed. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party committees, teachers and students have combined, promoted the communist spirit, carried out teaching reform on a large scale, carried out scientific research, and marched towards cutting-edge science. Those incompetent pseudo-"experts" are being exposed, and reactionary and corrupt bourgeois academic thoughts and educational thoughts are being criticized. With great destruction and great construction, many things that were unimaginable in the past have been solved or are being solved now. New efforts are producing new people who understand politics, have culture, can engage in mental labor, and can engage in physical labor. This is a new great victory of the Party's education policy, and a new great victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's educational thought.

Through the clues provided by the book "Comrade Mao Zedong on Educational Work," conscientiously studying Comrade Mao Zedong's writings on education, arming ourselves with Comrade Mao Zedong's educational thought, thoroughly studying the directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on education work, continuing to resolutely and correctly implement the Party's education policy, developing our country's education cause quickly, well and economically, continuously improving the quality of education, leading the cultural revolution to a deeper level, and promoting a greater leap forward in our country's education cause, should be the primary task of our educators across the country.

    认真学习毛泽东同志有关教育的著作 
    刘皑风
    目前，党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动结合”的方针的贯彻执行，已经在全国范围内取得了辉煌的成就，而且正在继续取得更大的成就。
    广大的工农群众，热烈欢迎和坚决拥护党的教育方针。但是，一些坚持资产阶级立场和观点的人，对党的教育方针，却怀着抵触情绪；也有不少的人，虽然愿意接受党的领导，却由于受资产阶级教育思想的影响较深，对党的教育方针，仍抱怀疑的态度。这些事实说明，要彻底贯彻执行党的教育方针，还须坚决地继续展开教育战线上社会主义道路与资本主义道路两条道路的斗争。
    “毛泽东同志论教育工作”一书的出版，对于我们进一步学习和研究中共中央、国务院关于教育工作的指示，继续开展教育战线上的两条道路的斗争，提供了一个无比犀利的思想武器。这对于提高全国广大教育工作者和青年学生的理论和思想水平，自觉地贯彻执行党的教育方针，有着非常重大的意义。虽然这本书只是给我们提出了一些学习毛泽东同志有关教育著作的线索。
    毛泽东同志的教育思想，是马克思列宁主义的教育原则结合了中国革命实践的具体运用和新的发展。毛泽东同志在我国革命的几个历史时期所规定的具体教育方针、政策，始终贯串着：教育必须为无产阶级的政治服务，教育必须与生产劳动结合，教育工作必须由党来领导，必须贯彻群众路线的指导思想。中共中央、国务院关于教育工作的指示，就是党中央和毛泽东同志的教育思想在我国当前形势下的具体体现。
    教育必须为无产阶级的政治服务
    毛泽东同志始终把革命的文化教育工作看作是整个无产阶级革命事业的一个重要的组成部分，并指出：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”（“毛泽东同志论教育工作”，第二九页。以下凡未注明出处的引文均见本书。）毛泽东同志在每个革命历史时期所规定的教育方针、政策，总是服从于我们党在当时的革命的总路线和总政策，使教育事业很好地为无产阶级的政治任务服务。从第一次国内革命战争时期的苏维埃文化教育总方针，到新民主主义革命时期的文化教育方针，都是为当时的无产阶级领导的人民革命战争和阶级斗争服务的。去年，毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中规定：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”这个宏伟的方针，正是为了加速建成社会主义和积极为向共产主义过渡奠定基础而制定的，是为整个社会主义建设服务的。
    随着我国革命形势的发展，毛泽东同志总是及时地指出文化教育工作的相应的发展方向。早在1927年，毛泽东同志就指出：“农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。”（一○页）1949年，毛泽东同志又指出：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”（四三页）1955年，当全国农村的社会主义改造进入高潮的时候，毛泽东同志说：“这件事告诉我们，中国的工业化的规模和速度，科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业的发展的规模和速度，已经不能完全按照原来所想的那个样子去做了，这些都应当适当地扩大和加快。”（四八页）历史的事实一再地证明了毛泽东同志预见的正确性。到今年，我国工农业生产出现了大跃进的新形势，共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展的时候，毛泽东同志又及时地指出：“这个事实标志着我国社会主义的经济革命（生产关系方面尚未完成改造的部分）、政治革命、思想革命、技术革命、文化革命正在向前奋进。……一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。彻底扫除这些垃圾，仍然需要时间；这些东西崩溃之势已成，则是确定无疑的了。”（五○页）我们当前的任务，就是认真学习毛泽东同志这些英明的指示，努力工作，坚决把教育战线上两条道路的斗争进行到底。
    毛泽东同志无比地关怀和热爱工农劳动群众，特别关心提高工农群众的政治觉悟和文化水平，培养工农干部和培养工人阶级的知识分子。1934年在苏维埃区域时就谈到“这里一切文化教育机关，是操在工农劳苦群众的手里，工农及其子女有享受教育的优先权。苏维埃政府用一切方法来提高工农的文化水平。”（一三页）1942年，“在延安文艺座谈会的讲话”中谈到普及与提高相结合的问题时，毛泽东同志特别阐明了：所谓普及和提高，就是要向工农兵普及，而且是用工农兵自己所需要、所便于接受的东西去普及；要从工农兵群众的基础上提高，而且是沿着工农兵自己前进的方向去提高，沿着无产阶级的方向去提高。提高干部，也是间接地为了提高群众。
    我们教育工作的任务是，必须做好普及教育的工作。当然，我们也决不能放松部分的提高，这不仅是建设社会主义所必需，也是为了将来的普遍提高创造条件。
    在关心工农群众知识化的同时，毛泽东同志还指示我们要重视对资产阶级知识分子的团结、教育、改造的工作。他曾经再三强调地指出：“我国的艰巨的社会主义建设事业，需要尽可能多的知识分子为它服务。凡是真正愿意为社会主义事业服务的知识分子，我们都应当给予信任，从根本上改善同他们的关系，帮助他们解决各种必须解决的问题，使他们得以积极地发挥他们的才能。”（一七八页）同时他也指出：知识分子一定要在深入工农群众，深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思列宁主义和学习社会的过程中，进行自我思想改造。早在1939年毛泽东同志就讲过：“然而知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”（一八八页）到去年，毛泽东同志又在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：“为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。”（一七九页）也就是说，要从资产阶级的立场上转移到无产阶级这方面来。这是一个根本的转变。所有知识分子，都应当努力完成这个转变。只有这样，才能使自己不落后于群众，不落后于这个伟大的时代。
    教育必须与生产劳动相结合
    毛泽东同志一贯主张教育和生产劳动结合。早在1934年，他在苏维埃文化教育的总方针中，就规定了要使“教育与劳动联系起来”。（一五页）在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志曾把延安和各敌后抗日根据地的青年们的团结一致、和工农群众相结合、学习革命的理论、实行生产劳动，看作是全国青年运动的方向。并提倡学校发展生产事业。全国解放以后的学校教育工作，在进行教学改革、提高学生文化科学水平方面，成绩显著；但是在一个时期内，学校教育脱离生产劳动，则是一个带方针性的错误。党中央和毛泽东同志及时地批评了这种错误，并且一再指示我们：学校教育必须结合生产劳动，学生必须参加生产劳动。
    教育和生产劳动结合，是无产阶级教育方针的基本特点之一。劳动创造了人类，劳动创造了人类的文化，教育不能和劳动分离。到了阶级社会时教育同劳动分离了，现在又要把它们结合起来。目的不仅在于多快好省地发展教育事业，彻底完成社会主义革命，加速建设社会主义，也是为了最后消灭脑力劳动同体力劳动的差别，实现共产主义的远大目标准备条件。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，也是理论与实践相结合的问题。教育与生产劳动结合的教育过程，我认为正是毛泽东同志“实践论”的“辩证唯物论的全部认识论”，“辩证唯物论的知行统一观”在教育工作中的具体运用。这样，就使整个教育过程成为实践、认识、再实践、再认识的过程，成为感性知识和理性知识辩证地发展过程。这是符合认识的客观规律的，因而也是最有效的。
    毛泽东同志经常教导我们重视理论学习，但是他坚决反对脱离实际地、教条主义地学习理论。特别是对青年学生来说，只讲书本知识，是不行的。要讲实际，教实际的道理，还必须与实践相结合。因为“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论，没有任何别的东西可以称得起我们所讲的理论。”（一三三页）在学校里，好的教科书，不论基础课也好，专业课也好，应该是从实践中总结出来又经过实践证明过的，空洞的、经不起实践考验的理论不是理论。
    试想：一个人从入小学到大学毕业，一连十几年，总是读书、读书、再读书，认识、认识、再认识，总搞些观念形态的东西，不让他们接触实际，长期地脱离劳动群众，脱离生产劳动，脱离实际生活，怎样能培养出能文能武，又红又专，既是劳动者又是知识分子的新人呢？
    近几个月来，学校大办工厂、农场，工厂、人民公社大办学校，不仅促进了教育事业的大发展，而且初步地创造了一些教育与生产劳动相结合的具体形式。实践的结果证明：凡是安排结合得好的，对学习、对生产都有很大的促进作用。不仅对教师学生的政治思想、身体锻炼方面有很大好处，在学业方面也有显著的进步，并且促进了科学研究工作的开展，提高了科学技术水平。正确地贯彻教育和生产劳动结合的方针，肯定能够提高教学质量，而不是降低教学质量。
    为了更好地贯彻执行党的教育方针，目前应该注意总结经验，合理安排课堂教学、生产劳动和休息的时间，把教学、生产、科学研究适当地结合起来。全日制的学校，还应该以教学为主，劳动时间不宜过多。我们既要反对那种只让学生死读书本、空谈理论、脱离实际的做法；又要防止片面地强调劳动实践，认为“实际即理论”、“生活即教育”，因而忽视文化和理论学习的倾向。
    教育工作必须由党来领导
    我国是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，一切工作都必须由党来领导。毛泽东同志早就讲过：“党是无产阶级的先锋队和无产阶级组织的最高形式，它应该领导一切其他组织。”（六六页）社会主义的教育事业，是整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的一个组成部分，是无产阶级改造人类、改造世界的工具，必须由党来实行统一的一元化的领导。经验证明：和党的一切工作同样，教育一脱离党的领导，就会迷失方向；脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众，工作就遭受损失。资产阶级知识分子，以“专家”、“内行”自居，而错误地认为党对科学研究对教学是“外行”，不能领导，因而对接受党的领导，常是思想抵触，口服心不服。但是，事实胜于雄辩。正如最近有一位高等学校的老教师所说：他从不相信党的领导到相信党能领导一切，是经过以下几个过程的：（1）共产党能打仗，未必能领导经济工作；（2）党能领导生产，领导不了高等学校；（3）党能领导高等学校，但是只能管行政，不能管教学；（4）党能领导教学工作，领导不了科学研究工作；（5）最近才认识到，科学研究工作党也能领导，而且领导的很好。这种立场、观点的转变，正是一个资产阶级知识分子自我改造的过程。
    教育工作必须贯彻群众路线
    为了贯彻党的领导，必须走群众路线。群众路线是党的工作的根本路线。毛泽东同志认为革命的教育事业，是人民群众自己的事业。因此，仅仅政府为群众举办教育事业是不行的，还必须走群众路线，发动群众自己来办。毛泽东同志说：“一切这些，也必须拿政治上动员民力与政府的法令相结合，主要的在于发动人民自己教育自己，而政府给以恰当的指导与调整，给以可能的物质帮助，单靠政府用有限财力办的几个学校、报纸等等，是不足完成提高民族文化与民族觉悟之伟大任务的。”（三三页）
    多少年来的经验反复证明：当我们片面地强调国家办学、“专家”办学，片面地强调办所谓正规学校的时候，就束缚了群众办学的手脚，教育事业的发展就比较迟缓，也就不能适应群众的需要；当我们除了国家办学外，同时注意发动群众，根据群众的不同需要，依靠群众自己办学的时候，教育事业就会蓬蓬勃勃地发展，而且为广大工农群众所欢迎。特别是近半年多来，教育事业方面所出现的史无前例的大跃进的新局面，也正是由贯彻群众路线，发动全党全民大办教育事业，大搞教育改革的结果。因此，我们要做好工农劳动人民的教育工作，就必须面向群众，采取“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的工作方法。毛泽东同志说：“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。如果把自己看作群众的主人，看作高踞于‘下等人’头上的贵族，那末，不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的。”（八五页）这话是十六年以前讲的，现在更有其现实意义。在我们从事社会主义与共产主义教育工作者的队伍中，还有不少的有这种贵族思想、老爷作风的人。他们站在群众之上，装腔作势，指手划脚；对群众运动，冷眼旁观，吹毛求疵。这是更加不应有的。官僚主义、主观主义之所以到处碰壁，专家、学者在学生面前之所以冷冷清清，感到孤立，正是由于自己脱离了群众的结果。
    由于各级党委进一步地加强了对教育工作的领导，政治挂帅，批判右倾保守思想和教条主义，破除迷信，解放思想，坚决执行了党的教育工作方针，采取了“三个相结合”、“六个并举”的走群众路线的工作方法，发动了全党全民大办教育事业。除了各级政府大办高等学校和中等学校以外，农村人民公社和城市工矿企业，在党委领导下，发动群众，自己也组织起来大办小学、中学、农业中学和其他职业学校。才几个月的时间，在扫除青壮年文盲，普及小学教育方面，取得了空前巨大成绩，还在扫除文盲的基础上，大办文化技术学校、红专学校、红专大学，书记挂帅、能者为师，以民教民、互教互学，政治、文化、技术三结合，真是万马奔腾，百花齐放。原有的高等学校和中等学校，在贯彻党的教育方针方面，也取得了显著的成绩，在党委领导下，大办工厂、农场，投入了大办钢铁的伟大突击运动，师生思想面貌为之一新。同时，在党委领导下，教师、学生相结合，发扬共产主义的精神，大搞教学改革，开展科学研究，向尖端科学进军。那些不学无术的伪“专家”正被揭穿，反动的和腐朽的资产阶级的学术思想和教育思想遭到批判。大破大立，许多过去想都不敢想的事情，现在解决了或正在解决着。新的努力正产生着新的既懂政治、又有文化，既能从事脑力劳动、又能从事体力劳动的新人。这是党的教育方针的新的伟大胜利，是毛泽东同志的教育思想的新的伟大胜利。
    通过“毛泽东同志论教育工作”这本书所提供的线索，认真学习毛泽东同志有关教育的著作，用毛泽东同志的教育思想武装起来，深入钻研中共中央、国务院关于教育工作的指示，继续坚决地、正确地贯彻执行党的教育方针，多快好省地发展我国教育事业，不断地提高教育质量，将文化革命引向深入，促进我国教育事业更大的跃进，应该是我们全国教育工作者的首要任务。
