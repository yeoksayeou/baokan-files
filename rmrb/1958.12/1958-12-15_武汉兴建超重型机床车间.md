    Wuhan is building an extra-heavy machine tool workshop. Once completed, it will produce dozens of extra-heavy machine tools weighing over 200 tons annually, providing equipment for China's machinery manufacturing sector to process large rolling mills, generators, steam turbines, and heavy mining machinery. One type of vertical lathe planned for production in this workshop will have a frame 16 meters high and a very large worktable. A basketball game accommodating over 200 spectators could almost be held on it. The lathe's components will require seventy freight cars to transport.
    Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant's construction of the extra-heavy machine tool workshop can fully utilize the plant's existing equipment, avoiding the need to rebuild as many auxiliary production facilities as would be required for a general extra-heavy machine tool plant. Only an extra-heavy casting workshop and some equipment need to be added. The main equipment for this workshop will be self-reliant and solved independently.

    武汉兴建超重型机床车间
    武汉重型机床厂正在兴建一个超重型机床车间。它建成以后，每年能生产几十台两百吨以上的超重型机床，将为我国机械制造部门提供加工大型轧钢机、发电机、汽轮机和重型矿山机械等的设备。这个车间准备生产的一种立式车床，机架高十六公尺，工作台很大，上面几乎可以进行能容纳两百多名观众的篮球赛，车床的部件需要七十个车皮才能运走。
    武汉重型机床厂建设超重型机床车间，可以充分利用本厂现有设备，不必重新建设一般超重型机床厂所必须的那样多的辅助生产设施，只要增建一个超重型铸造车间和部分设备即可。这个车间的主要设备将自力更生，自行解决。
