    The Wind and Waves of the Taiwan Strait
    Jiang Yizhen, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    In August and September of this year, dark clouds covered the Taiwan Strait, and turbulent waves surged as American imperialism bared its fangs and extended its bloody claws towards the Chinese people. The artillery fire on the front lines of Xiamen shook the world, and the eyes of the world's people turned to the Taiwan Strait. What did this storm bring? It brought notoriety and unprecedented isolation to American imperialism; it brought excellent training to the Chinese people, with everyone full of confidence and soaring enthusiasm, accelerating the pace of the Great Leap Forward.
  In the struggle of the Chinese people against American imperialism's war provocations and military threats, the military and civilians of Fujian bore the brunt, standing on the front line of the battle. American-made planes circled overhead, American-built warships cruised on the sea, and American-produced shells exploded on the coast. In such a tense situation, weren't there difficulties? Would construction be affected? The best answer to this question is the facts.
    Fujian is located on the front line of national defense, and the military and civilians of the province have always shouldered the dual tasks of consolidating coastal defense, liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and socialist construction. For the heroic military and civilians of Fujian, the wind and waves of the Taiwan Strait are not an obstacle, but a driving force. The flames of anti-aggression and soaring enthusiasm overcame tension and difficulties, leading to an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. People's communes, the mass steelmaking campaign, universal conscription, work-study programs, and scientific inventions have all achieved great success.
    Imperialism is a teacher by negative example, and the people of Fujian have a deep understanding of this. There are two sides to education, combining positive and negative, and neither is indispensable. Education from the opposite side is the most concrete and profound education. American imperialism's war provocations and military threats have played a role in mobilizing and educating the people from the opposite side.
    The armed threat of American imperialism is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate the Chinese people, but the facts have gone in the opposite direction of the imperialists' wishes. The Chinese people who have stood up cannot be intimidated. Fujian, like other parts of the country, quickly launched a tide of anti-aggression. More than ten million of the province's fourteen million people participated in demonstrations and rallies. In Haicheng County, across from Jinmen, 160,000 people demonstrated on one day. In Luoyuan County, across from Matsu, 120,000 people marched in the rain one night, with 40,000 torches like an angry fire dragon, turning the sea and sky around Luoyuan Bay red. This lesson was very beneficial, brightening the eyes of the masses, raising their fighting spirit, and boosting their enthusiasm.
    In the struggle against American imperialism's military provocations, the People's Liberation Army on the front lines of Fujian demonstrated noble communist ideological qualities and revolutionary heroism, and carried forward the glorious tradition of being "both a fighting force and a working force." On the one hand, they fought heroically, giving the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen a punitive blow, demonstrating the powerful force of the Chinese people against American imperialism's military provocations; on the other hand, they actively participated in industrial and agricultural production and construction. Every victory of the People's Liberation Army is a force, encouraging the people of the province to accelerate socialist construction with greater enthusiasm. And the good news of the all-round Great Leap Forward and the bumper harvests of grain and steel, in turn, inspired the three armed forces on the front lines to strive for greater victories in combat.
    The people's commune movement was originally an inevitable trend for the further development of productive forces, but the severe situation in the Taiwan Strait accelerated the pace of the movement. Within one month, from September to October, 97% of the rural population in the province participated in the communes. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants are integrated into one. In wartime, they are a fighting army; in peacetime, they are an industrial army. The anti-aggression struggle and production and construction are two major tasks that are interconnected and mutually reinforcing; the people's communes excellently shoulder these dual tasks, demonstrating unparalleled superiority. The masses of the people put forward the bold slogan: "Use molten iron to scald the invaders to death! Drown the warmongers with a sea of grain!" The storm in the Taiwan Strait fueled the raging fire of mass steelmaking. At the end of August, the province's daily iron production was only over a hundred tons, but on September 30th, it rose to 1,500 tons, and on October 21st, it jumped to 7,000 tons. In mid-November, the peak reached 18,000 tons per day, and the province's annual ironmaking task of 200,000 tons was overfulfilled one month ahead of schedule. The victory on the grain front was equally astonishing, with total output doubling. The goal of achieving a "thousand-catty province" was overfulfilled. Achieving such a glorious victory under the circumstances of busy support tasks on the front lines and coastal areas suffering from artillery fire was the result of a tenacious struggle. The people's commune on the front lines of Xiamen, facing Jinmen across the sea, was shelled more than 44,000 times in two months, with twelve villages destroyed and thirty villages damaged. However, the will of the people was extremely strong. When villages were destroyed, they slept in air-raid shelters; when crops were damaged, they replanted them as soon as possible. The shell fragments sent by the enemy became the best raw materials for steelmaking. The heroic people created miracles. This commune won the steelmaking championship of several communes in the suburbs of Xiamen this year, and rice production also increased by 80% compared to last year.
    In terms of work-study programs and scientific research, things were happening vigorously amidst the roar of artillery fire. American imperialism's military provocations played a role in fueling the flames. According to statistics in October, more than 300 universities and middle schools in the province had established more than 5,000 factories. Taking Xiamen University as an example, when the shells of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen damaged the classrooms, the teachers and students moved the classrooms and laboratories into the tunnels. Their slogan was: "Use the laboratory as a battlefield, and instruments as weapons." They successively established 105 factories, carried out the trial production of 201 new products, and more than 80 scientific research projects, many of which have reached advanced international and domestic levels.
    The militia organizations in Fujian have also developed and grown rapidly during this period. In just over ten days, the province organized 2 million backbone militia members, creating a mass armed movement of "everyone a soldier, everyone practicing martial arts." The militia in the Fujian area, especially the militia in the coastal areas, have fought side by side with the heroic People's Liberation Army for more than nine years. They not only have a high level of political literacy but also have rich practical experience. They participate in everything from catching smugglers, fighting against airborne drops, and attacking enemies who come to harass and attack, to standing guard, and patrolling the sea. During the days of shelling Jinmen to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops, the frontline militia directly participated in combat, repairing fortifications, transporting ammunition, carrying the wounded, and even firing artillery. The militia in Fujian is also well-trained and well-equipped. In many areas, the militia can not only use rifles and hand grenades but also machine guns and artillery; they not only master radio communication technology but also battlefield first aid. The militia in Fujian combines labor and military affairs. In peacetime, they are the backbone of the production front; once a war breaks out, they can immediately join the battle and skillfully strike the enemy. With such a well-trained, all-encompassing militia, any invading enemy will be submerged.
    Under the wise leadership of the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the people of Fujian are full of confidence and soaring enthusiasm, moving from victory to greater victory, and from Great Leap Forward to greater Great Leap Forward. The dual tasks of anti-aggression struggle and socialist construction will be completed better and more outstandingly. We believe that no matter whether American imperialism chooses war or peaceful competition, it is destined to fail completely.

    台湾海峡的风浪
    中共福建省委书记  江一真
    今年8、9月间，台湾海峡乌云遮天，浊浪翻滚，美帝国主义张牙舞爪，把血腥魔爪伸向中国人民。厦门前线的炮火震动了全世界，全世界人民的眼睛都向着台湾海峡。这场暴风雨带来了什么？它给美帝国主义带来了臭名远扬和空前孤立；给中国人民带来了极好的锻炼，人人信心百倍，干劲冲天，加快了跃进的脚步。
  在中国人民反对美帝国主义战争挑衅和军事威胁的斗争中，福建军民首当其冲，站在战斗的最前线。美国制的飞机在头顶上盘旋，美国造的军舰在海面上游动，美国产的炮弹在海岸上爆炸。在这样紧张的情况下，困难不困难？建设不受影响吗？这个问题的最好答案是事实。
    福建地处国防前线，全省军民历来就肩负着巩固海防，解放台、澎、金、马和社会主义建设的双重任务。台湾海峡的风浪，对英勇的福建军民来说，不是阻力，而是动力。反侵略的怒火和冲天的干劲，战胜了紧张，克服了困难。出现了前所未有的大跃进局面。人民公社化、全民炼钢铁、全民皆兵、勤工俭学、科学发明各项工作都取得了巨大成就。
    帝国主义是反面教员，福建人民对这点体会得很深刻。教育有两面，正反结合，缺一不可。对立面的教育是最具体最深刻的教育。美帝国主义的战争挑衅和军事威胁，从反面起了动员与教育人民的作用。
    美帝国主义的武装威胁，无非是想吓倒中国人民，但是事实走向了帝国主义者愿望的反面，站起来了的中国人民是吓不倒的，福建和全国各地一样，迅速卷起了一个反侵略的怒潮。全省一千四百多万人，有一千万人参加示威游行和集会。金门对面的海澄县，一天之内十六万人大示威，马祖对面的罗源县，一个晚上有十二万人冒雨游行，四万支火把像一条愤怒的火龙，烧红了罗源湾边的海空。这堂课好处很大，擦亮了群众的眼睛，提高了群众的斗志，鼓足了群众的干劲。
    在反对美帝国主义军事挑衅的斗争中，福建前线人民解放军表现了高贵的共产主义思想品质和革命英雄主义气概，发扬了“既是战斗队，又是工作队”的光荣传统，一方面英勇奋战，给予金门蒋军以惩罚性的打击，显示出中国人民反对美帝国主义军事挑衅的强大威力，一方面积极参加了工农业生产建设。人民解放军的每一个胜利，都是一股力量，鼓舞全省人民以更大干劲加速社会主义建设。而全面大跃进，粮、钢大丰收的喜讯，又反过来鼓舞前线三军在战斗中争取更大的胜利。
    人民公社化运动，原本是生产力进一步发展的必然趋势，台湾海峡的严重局势却加快了运动的步伐，在9月份到10月份的一个月时间内，全省97％的农村人口都参加了公社。工农兵学商五位一体，战时是战斗大军，平时是产业大军。反侵略斗争和生产建设是相互联系、相互促进的两大任务；人民公社卓越地担负起这双重任务，显示出了无比的优越性。人民群众提出豪迈的口号：“铁水烫死侵略者！粮海淹没野心狼！”台湾海峡的风暴吹旺了全民炼钢炼铁的野火。8月底，全省日产铁还只有一百多吨，9月30日就上升到一千五百吨，10月21日跃为七千吨，11月中旬最高峰达到日产一万八千吨，全省全年炼铁二十万吨的任务，提前一个月超额完成。粮食战线上的胜利同样惊人，总产量翻了一番。超额实现了千斤省。在支援前线任务繁忙、前沿地区遭受炮火威胁的情况下，获得这样辉煌的胜利，是经过顽强的斗争的。厦门前线的人民公社，与金门隔海相望，两个月内先后被炮击四万四千多发，十二座村庄被打毁，三十座村庄受创伤，然而人民的意志坚强无比，村庄被打塌，就在防炮洞里睡觉；庄稼被打坏，随缺随补种；敌人送来的炮弹片，成了最好的炼钢原料。英雄的人民创造了奇迹，这个公社今年夺得了厦门市郊几个公社的炼钢冠军；水稻产量也比去年增产了八成。
    在勤工俭学与科学研究方面，在炮声隆隆的时候正闹得轰轰烈烈，美帝国主义的军事挑衅，起了推波助澜的作用。到10月份统计，全省三百多所大、中学校，办了工厂五千多个。以厦门大学为例，金门蒋军的炮弹把教室打坏了，师生们就把课堂和实验室搬进坑道，他们的口号是：“以实验室当战场，仪器当刀枪”。他们先后办起一百零五个工厂，进行了二百零一种新产品的试制和八十多个项目的科学研究工作，其中不少已达到国际和国内先进水平。
    福建的民兵组织，在这个时期也得到了迅速的发展和壮大。全省在短短十多天内就组织起二百万基干民兵，出现一个“人人皆兵、个个习武”的全民武装运动。福建地区的民兵，特别是沿海地区的民兵，同英雄的人民解放军并肩作战，已有九年多的历史，不但具有高度的政治素养，还具有丰富的实战经验。抓偷渡，反空降，打击前来骚扰袭击的敌人，站岗放哨，海上巡逻，事事都有民兵参加。在炮击金门严厉惩罚蒋军的日子里，前线民兵更直接参加战斗，修工事，运弹药，抬伤员，以至开炮，样样都干。福建的民兵也是训练有素、装备齐整的。不少地区的民兵，既会使用步枪、手榴弹，也会使用机枪、大炮；既会掌握无线电通讯技术，也会战地救护。福建的民兵，劳武结合，平时是生产战线上的骨干，一旦发生战事，立即可以投入战斗，熟练地打击敌人。有了这样久经锻炼的天罗地网般的民兵海洋，任何来犯敌人都将被淹没。
    在伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，福建人民满怀信心，鼓足干劲，从胜利走向更大的胜利，从跃进走向更大的跃进。反侵略斗争和社会主义建设的双重任务都将完成得更好、更出色。我们相信，不论美帝国主义选择战争或和平竞赛，他都注定是要彻底失败的。
