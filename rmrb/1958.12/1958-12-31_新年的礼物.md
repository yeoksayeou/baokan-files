    New Year's Gift
    Li Xinhan
    We have been participating in physical labor in Shazhouba for over a month. Shazhouba is a nationally renowned revolutionary base area, and the folks here are so good, they treat us as "people sent by Chairman Mao." We quickly established deep feelings for each other.
    However, there is one thing that has been puzzling us. Sometimes, when we return from working in the fields, we often find our clothes filled with two bags of fried peanuts or something similar. Of course, we know that these are gifts secretly given to us by the villagers, but who exactly gave them? Nobody knows. What to do? The next morning, we took the fried peanuts to the fields where we were working and asked which villagers had sent them, but none of them answered, just smiled at us. The young men pretended to be annoyed and shouted at us: "If it's given to you, just eat it, why do you have to ask? Why do you need so much formality!" The girls also made sarcastic remarks about our questions, making us feel both amused and embarrassed.
    After dinner, we were preparing to visit Comrade Wang Wudie, an old revolutionary in the village. Just as we were about to leave with our notebooks, the old man himself arrived, huffing and puffing, wearing a pair of old shoes that looked like pine bark, his chin cleanly shaven. He was carrying a bottle of homemade liquor and walked into the room, took out two handfuls of fried beans from his pocket, and said, "Come on, good children, let's all have a drink!" We said, "Old man, we don't drink." Unexpectedly, this made him angry. He stood up abruptly, pointed at us, and said, "What do you take me for! Are you afraid of getting dirty?" "I heard the young people in the village say that you are always so polite to them. Isn't this a sign of being detached from the masses and alienating yourselves from the masses? They treat you like their own brothers and sisters, frying the peanuts that the commune distributed to them for the New Year and giving them to you to eat. And you, on the other hand, take them to the fields and shout, 'Who sent them? Who sent them?' When something is given to you, you should eat it, just like eating your own." After saying this, his topic slowly shifted to other matters. He drank his liquor and began to tell stories about Chairman Mao in Shazhouba. After telling each story, he would pant and sing a hoarse mountain song: "The People's Commune is a ladder to heaven, Communism is paradise. Chairman Mao built the tall ladder, don't forget the Communist Party for our happiness." We applauded enthusiastically.
    At midnight, the old man left us contentedly. We saw him outside, and the old man suddenly turned around and said to us, "Go back, don't scold me for being strict. Remember in the future, you must accept the gifts that are given to you. If the New Year comes and you refuse to accept other people's gifts, they will blame you."
    Yes, the New Year is approaching, and we know that on New Year's Day, the villagers will inevitably give gifts and sing mountain songs. We have to discuss countermeasures as soon as possible. Singing mountain songs, we are not afraid of that now; but how to deal with their gifts? Accepting them is not good; not accepting them will make them angry, saying that we look down on them. What to do? In the end, we decided to accept a little bit from each of them and give them a meaningful gift in return collectively.
    What gift would be most meaningful? Write a few poems? Paint a few pictures? No! The walls here are already covered with poems and paintings. What to do? Dozens of us were stumped by this small problem. After dinner, we gathered around the kerosene lamp to study the matter. Just as everyone was silent, we heard the sound of heavy footsteps outside. We turned our heads and looked out the window, and the door opened with a creak. It turned out to be the mischievous A-Cheng. As soon as he entered, he slapped his thigh and let out a joyful cry: "Your school sent you a package." He took it out of his pocket, placed it on the bed, and turned to leave. "Won't you sit for a while?" we called to him. He replied briefly, "No time."
    We opened the package, which contained many letters without envelopes, written by students at the school. Below the letters was a flag with two lines of yellow characters: "The people of the whole country love you, the people of the whole country support you." According to the letter, this flag was a gift from the oil workers of Xinjiang to the artillery comrades on the Fujian front. The artillery comrades, in turn, gave it to all the students in our school in response to our condolences to them. What a precious gift this is! Now the students in the school are giving this precious flag to us classmates who have come to the countryside to participate in labor. This is the highest respect! This is the warmest greeting! We turned the flag over and over, touching it with our fingers. Everyone became excited and tender, and everyone had a lot to say, but no one spoke.
    Finally, we unanimously decided to give this precious flag to the villagers as a gift to express our gratitude for their usual care for us, and as a New Year's greeting to them.

    新年的礼物 
    黎新汉
    我们来沙洲坝参加体力劳动已经一个多月了。沙洲坝是全国闻名的革命故乡，这里的老乡真好，把我们看作“毛主席派来的人”，我们之间很快就建立了深厚的感情。
    只是有一件事，怪叫我们伤脑筋。有时，我们下地回来，往往发现自己的衣服里满满地装着两袋炒花生什么的。当然，我们知道这是老乡们偷偷地送给我们的礼物，可是究竟是哪个老乡呢？谁也不知道。怎么办呢？第二天早晨，我们把炒花生带到干活的地里，问是哪些老乡送的，他们谁也不回答，只是向我们笑笑。小伙子装腔作势对我们嚷道：“送给你们就吃嘛，为什么要问呢？干嘛还来一套婆婆妈妈的礼节！”姑娘们也为我们的发问说些风凉话，弄得我们真是哭笑不得。
    晚饭后，我们准备去访问村里的老革命同志王伍爹。拿着笔记本正要出发的时候，老头子自己赶来了，气咻咻地，脚上穿着一双松树皮似的旧皮鞋，下巴刮得干干净净。他拿着一瓶水酒，走进屋里来，从腰袋里掏出两把炒豆子，说道：“来，好孩子，大家先喝一杯！”我们说：“老爹，我们不喝酒。”想不到一句话使他光火起来，他登地站起，指着我们说：“把我看作什么人！怕脏吗？”“我听见村里的年青人说，你们老是对他们客客气气，这就是脱离群众、疏远群众的行为，是不是？他们对你们像亲兄弟，把社里分给他们过年的花生米炒好送给你们吃。你们呢，却拿到地里嚷着：‘是谁送的，是谁送的？’送给你们的东西，你们就要吃，像吃自家的一样。”说完以后，他的话题慢慢转到别的方面去了。他一面喝着酒，一面开始讲毛主席在沙洲坝的故事。每讲完一段故事，他就喘着气沙哑地唱起山歌来：“人民公社是天梯，共产主义是天堂。高高天梯毛主席搭，幸福不忘共产党。”我们热烈鼓掌。
    深夜十二点钟，老头子满意地离开我们，我们送他到外面，老头子忽然回过头对我们说：“你们回去吧，不要骂我严厉。以后记住，送给你们的礼物一定要收下。假如新年来了，你们也拒绝收下别人的礼物，人家要怪你们的。”
    是的，新年快到了，我们知道新年那天，老乡们少不了要送礼物唱山歌的，我们不得不及早商量对策了。唱山歌，我们现在倒不怕了；可是如何对付他们的送礼呢。接受又不好；不接受，又惹他们生气，说我们瞧不起他们。怎么办呢？最后我们决议接受他们每人一丁点，给他们集体送还一件有意义的礼物。
    什么礼物最有意义呢？写几首诗吗，画几幅画吗，不！这里已经诗画满墙了。怎么办呢，我们几十个人竟给这个小问题难住了。晚饭后，我们围在火油灯下研究起来。大家正在沉默的时候，外面响起咚隆咚隆的脚步声。我们掉头向窗外望出去，房门呀的一声打开了，原来是调皮鬼阿诚。他一进门就拍大腿，发出快活的叫声：“你们学校寄给你们一包东西。”说着从口袋里摸出来，摆在床上，转身就走。“你不坐一会吗？”我们叫他。他简短地回答：“没有时间。”
    我们打开包裹，里面叠着许多没有信封的信，是在校同学写的。信下面一面旗，旗上两行黄字：“全国人民热爱你们，全国人民支持你们。”据来信说，这面旗是新疆石油工人赠给福建前线的炮兵同志的。炮兵同志又把它转赠给我们学校全体同学，回答我们对他们的慰问。这是一件多么珍贵的礼物！现在学校里的同学又把这面珍贵的旗送给我们下乡参加劳动的同学，这是最崇高的敬意！这是最亲切的问候！我们把旗子翻来翻去地用手指摸着，大家变得又激动，又温柔，每个人都有一肚子话，可是谁也不开腔。
    最后，我们一致决议，把这面珍贵的旗转送给老乡们，作为感激他们平时关怀我们的礼物，作为新年祝贺他们的礼物。
