Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 28th: People's communes in Gansu's winter wheat producing areas have established wheat field management professional teams, seizing the final stage of pre-freeze wheat field management to ensure that wheat seedlings are well-fed, well-watered, and kept warm for the winter. Currently, the wheat seedlings are tillering and generally growing uniformly and vigorously.

The Gansu region has experienced strong winds and little snow this year, and a severe winter is approaching. A slight oversight could lead to the large-scale death of wheat seedlings. Therefore, all localities have implemented political command, with county party secretaries and county heads personally overseeing wheat field management. They have also specifically organized and promoted the wheat file system and the wheat seedling field management system based on divided routes and areas. Currently, wheat fields in all localities have generally been watered once to strengthen the roots, and some areas are carrying out a second watering. The Pingliang Special Zone, the main winter wheat producing area in Gansu, plans to water the wheat fields three times before the freeze. To achieve this plan, the masses have devised many methods to accelerate winter irrigation. For example, the Dongfeng People's Commune in Jingchuan established irrigation liaison signals on the canals, enabling contact to be made in a few minutes, and created a method for irrigating steep slopes. The Hongqi People's Commune achieves an irrigation efficiency of up to 700 mu per day, completing the first watering before the 10th.

People's communes are also very busy with the activity of covering wheat fields with warm seedling fertilizer. They apply various fertilizers such as soil fertilizer, smoked fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and oil residue in proportion to meet the needs of different soil types. Ning County mobilized a 30,000-strong army for fertilizer production and transportation, adopting the methods of obtaining materials locally, manufacturing them locally, and topdressing them locally. It built 10 million smoked fertilizer towers, using local humus soil to burn smoked fertilizer, producing 1 billion jin of smoked fertilizer in half a month, with an average application of 8,000 jin of smoked fertilizer per mu of wheat field. The Zhuanglang Yuntai People's Commune mobilized 3,000 commune members to advance along the Yuntai and Mudan Rivers, from the plains to the mountains, covering fertilizer piece by piece, topdressing more than 15,000 jin per mu on over 11,000 mu of wheat fields, and covering high-yield fields with 50,000 to 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. While covering warm seedling fertilizer, the people's communes also paid attention to compaction work to ensure soil density, fill cracks, and preserve moisture and warmth. Many places have also blocked shortcuts through wheat fields and organized goose-hunting teams to prevent trampling by people, livestock, and wild birds.

Currently, many people's communes have established management stations, assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for wheat management within their respective areas, thereby achieving a wheat system management responsibility network where "every road has a commander, every area has a general, every plot has a soldier, everyone is responsible, and no point is missed." The Hongxing People's Commune on the Dongliang Canal in Wushan County, a nationally renowned banner for diverting water uphill, has further divided the land into eight production-increase areas based on soil quality, levelness, water conservancy facilities, and transportation conditions after realizing the systematization of mountain self-flowing irrigation. All areas are subject to file management, with the commune party committee members responsible for large areas, the general branch committee members responsible for areas, and party members responsible for plots, thus making the commune's more than 7,000 mu of winter wheat achieve garden-style cultivation.

### 抓紧封冻前的麦田管理  甘肃建立小麦系统管理责任网

    抓紧封冻前的麦田管理  
    甘肃建立小麦系统管理责任网
    新华社兰州28日电  甘肃冬小麦产区的各人民公社，建立麦田管理专业队，大抓封冻前麦田管理的最后一关，保证麦苗吃饱喝好、暖暖和和的过冬。目前，麦苗正在分蘖，一般都长得整齐茁壮。
    甘肃地区今年风大雪小，严冬又将降临，稍一疏忽，麦苗便可能大量死亡。因此，各地都实行了政治挂帅，由县委书记、县长亲自抓麦田管理；并且还具体组织推广小麦档案制、分路分方的麦苗田管理制度。现在，各地麦田已普遍浇过一次压根水，有些地区正在进行第二次浇灌。甘肃冬小麦主要产地的平凉专区，计划在封冻以前给麦田浇三次水。为实现这一计划，群众想了许多加速冬灌的办法。如泾川东风人民公社在渠道上建立了灌溉联络信号，在几分钟之内就可以取得联系，并创造了灌溉陡坡地的方法。红旗人民公社每天浇地效率高达七百亩，10日以前即灌完头水。
    各人民公社使麦田盖暖苗肥的活动也很紧张。他们按不同土质的需要，分别按比例地施盖土肥、熏肥、化肥和油渣等多种肥料。宁县出动三万造肥运肥大军，采取就地取材，就地制造，就地追肥的方法，建成千万座熏肥塔，利用当地腐植质泥土，烧制熏肥，半月熏肥达十亿斤，平均每亩麦田追施熏肥八千斤。庄浪云台人民公社调动三千名社员，从云台、牡丹两条大川分路进军，由川到山，一片一片地盖肥，给一万一千余亩麦田，每亩追肥一万五千斤以上，高产田每亩盖肥五至十万斤。各人民公社在结合盖暖苗肥的同时，还注意了镇压工作，保证土壤实密，填平裂缝，保墒保温。许多地方还截堵麦地捷路，组织打雁队，防止人、畜、野禽的践踏。
    现在，许多人民公社都设立了管理站，固定专人，负责所属范围内的小麦管理，从而做到“路路有帅，方方有将，块块有兵，人人负责，点点不漏”的小麦系统管理责任网。全国著名的引水上山旗帜——武山县东梁渠上的红星人民公社，在实现了山地自流灌溉系统化的基础上，又按土质、平整程度、水利设施以及交通条件等，划为八个增产方，全部实行档案管理制度，由公社党委委员包大片，总支委员包方，党员包块，从而，使这个社七千多亩冬小麦实现了耕作园田化。（附图片）
