Sino-Western Medicine Collaboration to Subdue Tumors
	Mu Feng
In recent years, tumors, especially malignant tumors, have become the number one "culprit" threatening human life. Generally speaking, untreated malignant tumors take the lives of patients in a matter of months to about two years.

At the recent National Experience Exchange Conference on the Technological Revolution in Medicine and Health, people visited the effects of traditional Chinese medicine in treating malignant tumors with great excitement. A case of acute leukemia, confirmed by bone marrow cell classification examination at the Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, was cured after treatment with traditional Chinese medicine. The patient even gave birth to a daughter after being cured. This is truly like a "miracle." The blood of leukemia patients is full of white blood cells, sometimes as many as hundreds of thousands per cubic millimeter (normal people only have about five thousand). This disease is generally recognized as a malignant tumor of white blood cells. When I was studying at medical school, I remember the teacher telling us: the consequences of leukemia are not good, "acute three months, chronic three years." Traditional Chinese medicine does not know this disease, but it can treat it based on symptoms. For example, when leukemia patients show symptoms of fever, nosebleeds, excessive sweating, paleness, shortness of breath, and a weak and rapid pulse, traditional Chinese medicine believes that this is a heat-related disease, the heat evil enters the yin aspect, causing internal damage to the yin essence, and internal heat in the bone marrow. Therefore, the principle of treatment is to nourish yin, clear heat, detoxify, stop bleeding, and so on. However, some symptoms of acute infectious diseases are similar to this disease, and traditional Chinese medicine may also use the above principles to treat them. Leukemia and acute infectious diseases can actually be treated with the same method, and they are actually cured. Isn't this a miracle? How to explain it? This is the key to mutual learning, mutual research, and improvement between Chinese and Western medicine.

Now, the effect of using traditional Chinese medicine methods to treat tumors is already undeniable. In Henan Province, Chinese medicine prescriptions have been used to treat more than a thousand cases of esophageal cancer. In Dalian, "Shennong Pills" were used to treat a total of 188 cases of various tumors, with improvement in about 60% of the cases. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine in Chengdu has achieved considerable results in treating malignant giant cell tumors of the bone, and traditional Chinese medicine in Hebei Province has achieved considerable results in treating "Hodgkin's disease" (another type of malignant tumor).

However, traditional Chinese medicine often finds it difficult to detect some early cancers with inconspicuous symptoms, and therefore may miss treatment opportunities. Western medicine, however, has methods for early detection of precancerous lesions, such as performing Pap smears to diagnose cervical cancer. If traditional Chinese medicine can cooperate with Western medicine's early routine examinations and detect lesions in a timely manner, the treatment effect may be better.

Western medicine is not without solutions for cancer, such as surgery, radiation therapy, nitrogen mustard, antibiotics... etc., which also have considerable effects, but they are not perfect after all. Of course, traditional Chinese medicine treatment is not 100% effective either. Because of this, it is even more necessary for Chinese and Western medicine to converge, strengthen cooperation, and put the patient's health first in everything.

It can be expected that in the near future, when the integration of Chinese and Western medicine is realized, the cure rate of tumors will no longer be 50%, 60%, but as sure as treating malaria, pneumonia... Cancer will bow its head under the confluence of Chinese and Western medicine!

    中西医合作  让肿瘤低头
    木风
    近年来，肿瘤，尤其是恶性肿瘤，已经成为威胁人类生命的第一个“罪魁”了。一般说来，不经治疗的恶性瘤子，总是在几个月以至二年左右夺去病人的生命。
    不久前召开的全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流会上，人们怀着极其兴奋的心情参观了中医治疗恶性瘤子的效果。贵阳医学院附属医院用骨髓细胞分类检查确诊的急性白血病一例，用中药治疗后，获得痊愈，病人并且在治愈后平产一女。这真像个“奇迹”一样。白血病的病人，血液中充满着白血球，有时每立方毫米多至数十万个（正常人只有五千个左右），这个病一般公认为一种白血球的恶性肿瘤。我在医学院读书时，记得老师对我们这样说：白血病后果不妙，“急性三个月，慢性三年”。中医并不知道这种病，但是他能根据症状治疗。比如当白血病病人表现出发热、流鼻血、汗多、苍白、气短、脉搏细而速的症状时，中医认为这是热性病，热邪进入阴分，使阴精内伤，骨髓内热，因此，治疗的原则就是育阴、清热、解毒、止血等等。不过，有些急性传染病的症状类似这种病，中医也可能用上述原则来治疗。白血病和急性传染病竟然可以用同样办法治疗，而且居然治好了，这不是奇迹吗？如何解释呢？这正是需要中西医互相学习互相研究提高的关键。
    现在用中医方法治疗肿瘤的效果已经是无容置辩的了。河南省中医用药方治疗食道癌的病例，已在一千人以上；旅大市用“神农丸”治疗各种瘤肿共一百八十八例，好转病例在60％左右。此外，成都市中医治疗骨的恶性巨细胞瘤、河北省中医治疗“何杰舍氏”病（另一种恶性瘤子）都获得了相当好的效果。
    但是，中医对一些症状不显著的早期癌瘤，常常不容易发现，因而就可能误过治疗机会。西医却有早期发现癌前期病变的方法，如作阴道癌细胞抹片检查诊断宫颈癌等。如果中医能配合西医的早期例行检查，及时发现病变，那么，治疗效果也许会更好些。
    西医对癌肿也不是毫无办法的，外科手术、放射治疗、芥子氮、抗生素……等，也有相当的疗效，然而毕竟还不是十全十美的。当然，中医治疗也不是百分之百的有效。正因为这样，所以更需要中西医合流，加强合作，一切从病人健康出发。
    可以预期，不久的将来，当中西合流得到实现的时候，肿瘤的治疗率不再是50％，60％，而是像治疗疟疾、肺炎……那样十拿九稳了。癌瘤将在中西医的合流下低头！
