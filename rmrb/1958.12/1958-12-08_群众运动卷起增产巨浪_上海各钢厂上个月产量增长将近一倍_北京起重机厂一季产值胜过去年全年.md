This Dispatch from Shanghai, December 7th. By planting ideological red flags among steelworkers and launching mass movements around steel furnaces, Shanghai's steel output in November increased from over 123,000 tons in October to over 236,000 tons, with the average daily output surging by 97.6%.

In November, all steel plants generally carried out socialist and communist ideological education. The political consciousness of both new and old workers was greatly enhanced. Leaders of each workshop also used the method of vigorously launching mass movements to mobilize the masses to tackle technical challenges and solve key production problems. With the gradual deepening of ideological education and mass movements, the average daily steel output increased from one ten-day period to the next: the average for the entire month of October was over 3,900 tons; in the first ten days of November, it rose to 7,000 tons, then further to over 7,800 tons in the middle ten days, and even higher to over 8,700 tons in the last ten days. In the last four days of the month, it remained stable above 9,200 tons every day, and on the 29th, it broke the 10,000-ton mark, reaching 10,160 tons.

The mass movement is invincible, making the production of newly built steelmaking workshops gradually normalize, becoming a powerful new force for increasing Shanghai's steel output. The 52 large-scale steelmaking furnaces planned to be built this year (with a total annual output of more than 2 million tons of steel) were all quickly completed and put into production by November 28, thanks to the concerted efforts of all fronts in Shanghai, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants. These new workshops initially encountered difficulties such as the new furnaces being difficult to master and new workers being technically unskilled. In addition, the quality of the local iron and coke used for steelmaking was poor, resulting in very abnormal production. The converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, newly built with an annual output of 600,000 tons of steel, broke the superstition that "new workshops cannot be put into normal production in the short term" and vigorously launched a mass movement, normalizing production first. In October, the average daily output of this workshop was only over 300 tons, and the cadres were still in a state of chaos. After the leaders went deep among the masses, they found that most of the new workers, although technically unskilled, had a passion for fighting for steel. Therefore, they organized them, explained the situation and tasks to them, strengthened technical education, and organized the masses to freely air their views and debate key production issues one by one, and everyone came up with ways to solve them. Because the masses were mobilized more fully, the average daily output of this workshop in November surged to 919 tons, with seven days of daily output exceeding 1,000 tons. Leaders of another new converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, with an annual output of 600,000 tons of steel, also launched three major reforms in ideology, technology, and management after criticizing the erroneous view that "there are many new workers, and we can only rely on administrative orders to do things." The average daily output also increased from over 300 tons in October to over 700 tons in November. Even the production of the second-line construction projects, which have only been put into production for a short time, has now begun to improve.

The mass movement has changed the production landscape of all old steelmaking workshops in Shanghai, making the advanced even more advanced and the backward catch up quickly. The national high-yield open-hearth furnace red flag, the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, further increased its utilization coefficient from 17.046 tons in October to 18.44 tons in November. The party organization of this workshop carried out "four grasps" work focusing on grasping political command, grasping mass movements, grasping the improvement of leadership style, and grasping propaganda and mobilization, targeting the ideological situation of the employees and the key problems in production. Cooperation and competition between shifts, groups, and individuals were further unfolded among the three shifts of workers, thereby over fulfilling the higher steelmaking plan for November. The employees of this workshop have also further established the style of "the whole country as one chessboard." Some of the molten steel they produced was cast into steel ingots, and some was supplied to the foundry workshop to make a large number of castings for rolling mill equipment. However, the temperature of the molten steel for casting should be relatively high, and the quality should be relatively good, which often lengthened the steelmaking time. Therefore, some employees originally hesitated to cast castings, worrying that they would not be able to maintain the national high-yield red flag. In November, the employees repeatedly discussed this issue, criticized the idea of "abandoning castings and taking a convenient path to maintain the red flag," and established the idea of "grasping castings and taking a difficult path to hold the red flag higher." In production, they took the initiative to contact foundry workers. In order to ensure the quality of molten steel, they sometimes did not hesitate to prolong the smelting time by one or two hours, and found potential from other places to win back the time. In November, they not only completed the plan of their own workshop, but also cooperated with the foundry workshop to complete the production plan, and both the ideological red flag and the production red flag were held higher.

The old converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, which had not completed the plan for several months, on the one hand, organized employees to engage in theoretical study to establish a strong sense of planning and production responsibility; on the other hand, it organized several special groups according to the key points of production and mobilized the masses to encircle and suppress them, and production has improved significantly. In November, it over fulfilled the steelmaking plan.

December is the last month of Shanghai's decisive battle to complete the annual plan of 1.2 million tons of steel. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Metallurgical Industry recently convened a meeting of the party committee secretaries and factory directors of its affiliated steel plants to deploy and call on each plant to further mobilize the masses to complete the annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing. The Beijing Crane Factory launched a mass movement around the key issues of production, which made the problems solved quickly and production leaped again and again. The output value of the third quarter alone completed 111% of the task equivalent to the total output value of last year. Now all the factory workers are working hard to complete this year's leap forward plan. This plan is equivalent to three and a half times the actual completed output value of last year.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the factory's production tasks have continued to increase, but due to the lack of equipment and workers, it faced three key problems in production: the mechanical workshop had insufficient strength, and the amount of parts processing could not reach one-third of the leap forward plan; the castings in the foundry workshop could not meet the needs of processing; and many raw materials were in short supply. These three key issues affected the completion of the factory's leap forward plan.

The factory's party committee carefully analyzed the factory's production situation, criticized the erroneous ideas of some conservatives, and decided to mobilize the masses to solve key problems; at the same time, the party committee members divided up the work according to the three key problems, contracted the workshops, handed over the problems to the masses, let the workers speak freely and debate freely, and broke the old rules that workers' rationalization proposals had to pass "four levels" (application form, group, workshop, and factory approval), and mobilized the workers to put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. In this way, the workers' enthusiasm was greatly increased, and more than 280,000 rationalization proposals were put forward. Some feasible suggestions were immediately adopted by the leaders. For example, someone suggested using the advanced experience of high-speed and high-strength cutting to improve the production efficiency of machine tools. After the leaders adopted it, a vigorous movement to promote the experience of high-speed and high-strength cutting and build indigenous machine tools was launched. The production efficiency of machine tools quickly doubled generally, and more than a dozen indigenous machine tools manufactured by the workers were quickly put into production. Various fraternal workshops also voluntarily dispatched more than 40 workers to support the mechanical workshop. Therefore, the production of the mechanical workshop quickly increased more than twice as much as in the past. The other two key problems were also solved in the mass movement led by the party. The foundry workshop promoted the advanced experience of leaky molds and multiple castings in one mold, which increased the daily output of castings from 17 tons to 40 tons, basically meeting the needs of processing. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, the workers established more than a dozen small factories for steelmaking, coking, refractory materials, power generation, and bearings.

Now, in order to prepare for next year's production, the factory's party committee has handed over the key problem of insufficient raw materials to the workers. All the factory workers are vigorously engaged in steelmaking and rolling mill equipment, preparing to refine steel and manufacture steel themselves, overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw material supply, and welcome a greater leap forward next year.

    群众运动卷起增产巨浪
    上海各钢厂上个月产量增长将近一倍
    北京起重机厂一季产值胜过去年全年
    本报上海7日电  在炼钢工人中插上思想红旗，在炼钢炉旁大搞群众运动，上海11月份的钢产量由10月份的十二万三千多吨增加到二十三万六千多吨，平均日产量猛增97.6％。
    各炼钢厂在11月份里比较普遍地展开了社会主义和共产主义思想教育，新老工人的政治觉悟大大提高，各车间领导又都以大搞群众运动的方法，发动群众猛攻技术关，解决生产关键问题。随着思想教育工作和群众运动的逐步深入，钢的平均日产量一旬高过一旬：10月全月平均为三千九百多吨；11月上旬上升到七千吨，中旬再上升到七千八百多吨，下旬更达到八千七百多吨。月末四天天天稳定在九千二百吨以上，29日更突破万吨关而达到了一万零一百六十吨。
    群众运动无往不胜，使新建炼钢车间的生产渐趋正常，成为上海增加钢产量的一支强大生力军。今年计划建设的五十二座大型炼钢炉（共可年产钢二百多万吨），在全市工农兵学商各条战线的通力协作下，到11月28日止已全部快速建成投入生产。这些新车间开始都曾经碰到新炉子难掌握和新工人技术不熟练的困难，加上炼钢用的土铁、焦炭质量又不好，生产很不正常。上钢三厂新建的可年产六十万吨钢的转炉车间，破除了“新车间无法在短期内正常生产”的迷信，大搞群众运动，生产首先正常了起来。10月份，这个车间平均日产量只有三百多吨，干部还忙乱不堪。领导人员深入群众以后，发现大部分新工人虽然技术不熟练，但都有一股为钢而战的热情。于是把他们组织起来，向他们讲清形势任务，加强技术教育，并对生产关键问题组织群众逐一鸣放辩论，大家想办法解决。由于群众发动得比较充分，这个车间11月份的平均日产量就猛增到九百十九吨，并有七天日产一千吨以上。上钢一厂另一个可年产六十万吨钢的新转炉车间，领导人员也在批判了“新工人多，只能依靠行政命令办事”的错误观点以后，发动群众进行思想、技术、管理上的三大改革，平均日产量也由10月份的三百多吨上升到11月份的七百多吨。即使投入生产时间还很短的第二线建设工程，生产现在也开始有所好转。
    群众运动改变了上海所有炼钢厂老车间的生产面貌，使先进的更先进了，落后的迅速赶了上来。全国平炉高产红旗——上钢三厂平炉车间，利用系数在10月份的一七点○四六吨的基础上，11月份再上升到一八点四四吨。这个车间党组织针对职工的思想情况和生产上的关键问题，进行了抓政治挂帅、抓群众运动、抓改进领导作风、抓宣传鼓动的“四抓”工作，三班工人中进一步展开了班与班、组与组、人与人之间的协作和竞赛，从而又超额完成了11月份更高的炼钢计划。这个车间职工还进一步树立起了“全国一盘棋”的风格。他们炼出的钢水一部分浇成钢锭，一部分是供铸造车间作成大批轧钢设备的铸件。但浇铸件的钢水温度要比较高、质量也要比较好，常常拉长了炼钢时间，因此有些职工原来对浇铸件有些犹豫，担心保不住全国高产红旗。11月份，职工们反复讨论了这个问题，批判了这种“抛开铸件，走方便道路去保住红旗”的思想，树立起了“抓住铸件，走困难道路把红旗举得更高”的思想，在生产中主动与铸造职工联系，为了保证钢水的质量，有时不惜拖长一、二小时的冶炼时间，另外从别的地方找潜力，把时间争取回来。11月份，他们不仅完成本车间计划，也配合铸造车间完成了产量计划，思想红旗和生产红旗都举得更高了。
    已经有几个月没有完成计划的上钢三厂老转炉车间，一方面组织职工务虚，树立起强烈的计划观念和生产责任感；一方面根据生产关键组织了几个专门小组，发动群众进行围攻，生产便有了显著好转，11月份就超额完成了炼钢计划。
    12月份是上海完成全年一百二十万吨钢计划最后决战的一个月，上海市冶金工业局最近已召开了所属各炼钢厂的党委书记、厂长会议进行部署，号召各厂进一步发动群众完成全年计划。
    本报讯  北京起重机厂围绕生产关键开展群众运动，使问题解决得快，生产一跃再跃，仅第三季度就完成了相当于去年全年产值111％的任务。现在全厂职工正努力完成今年的跃进计划。这个计划相当去年实际完成产值的三倍半。
    大跃进以来，这个厂的生产任务不断增加，但由于设备缺、工人少，在生产上就面临三大关键问题：机工车间力量不足，零件加工量达不到跃进计划的三分之一；铸工车间的铸件满足不了加工的需要；许多原料供应不足。这三个关键问题影响着全厂跃进计划的完成。
    工厂党委认真分析了全厂的生产情况，批判了一些保守派的错误思想，决定发动群众解决关键问题；同时，党委委员们按三大关键问题分工包干，深入车间，把问题交给群众，让工人大鸣大放大辩论，并且打破过去工人提合理化建议要过“四关”（领表、小组、车间和厂部批准）的陈规，发动工人大提合理化建议。这样，工人积极性大大提高，共提出了合理化建议二十八万多条。有些可行的建议领导方面立即加以采纳。如有人建议用高速强力切削的先进经验，来提高机床生产效率，领导上采纳后，一个轰轰烈烈的推广高速强力切削经验和大造土机床的运动展开了，机床生产效率很快就普遍提高了一倍，工人们制造的十多台土机床迅速地投入了生产。各兄弟车间也主动抽出四十多个工人支援机工车间。因此机工车间生产很快就比过去提高了两倍以上。另外的两个关键问题，也在党所领导的群众运动中解决了。铸工车间推广了漏模和一模多铸的先进经验，使铸件的日产量由十七吨提高到四十吨，基本上满足了加工的需要。为了克服原料不足的困难，工人们办了炼钢、炼焦、耐火材料、发电、轴承等十多个小工厂。
    现在，这个工厂的党委为了作好明年生产的准备工作，又把原料不足的关键问题交给了工人。全厂工人正在大搞炼钢和轧钢设备，准备自己炼钢和制成钢材，克服原料供应不足的困难，迎接明年更大的跃进。
