Tools as Weapons, Factories as Battlefields, Production Supporting the Front
Xiamen Luguang Rubber Factory's Output Increases Fivefold

    (Reported by this newspaper) Xiamen Luguang Rubber Factory, while heroically persisting in production during the struggle against the enemy, also vigorously supported the front, achieving outstanding results. The output value completed in the four months from September to December this year is equivalent to 132% of the output value of the past eight months. The annual output value has increased more than five times compared to last year.

    The Xiamen Luguang Rubber Factory was only developed in 1956. At that time, the factory had only a few dilapidated rubber mixing machines and thirteen workers, and could only produce small sundries such as fountain pen sacs and rubber shoe soles, with an annual output value of only 242,000 yuan. Now, it is a comprehensive rubber factory with more than 1,200 workers and new equipment capable of producing three million pairs of rubber shoes and 20,000 sets of tires annually.

    In August this year, when the news of the US imperialists launching a war provocation in the Taiwan Strait region reached the factory, all the workers were extremely angry and held meetings to denounce the crimes of US-Chiang military provocations and expose the US-Chiang conspiracy to provoke war. The workers were determined to turn anger into strength, putting forward the fighting slogan of "Tools as weapons, factories as battlefields, create new production achievements, strangle the US-Chiang wolf ambitions," and quickly plunged into a high-yield competition, setting off a climax of both persisting in production and supporting the front.

    Because the workers of this factory persisted in production so heroically, working harder and harder, the monthly output value rose from 1.07 million yuan in September to 1.85 million yuan in December, and the annual production leap plan, which was more than five times higher than last year, was completed ahead of schedule on December 20.

    While persisting in production and completing the state plan, the factory also excellently completed its tasks of supporting the front. The workers said: "What the front needs, we will give it; when they want it, we will give it!" and resolutely completed all tasks of supporting the front. Once, a certain unit of the air force urgently needed a special rubber product. After receiving this task, the factory immediately convened a meeting of technicians and skilled workers to study ways to complete this batch of tasks and immediately put them into action. At that time, there were no models or drawings, so the factory immediately organized personnel to design and draw while cooperating with the Xiamen Machine Repair Factory to rush to make models overnight. After twenty hours of hard work, this batch of urgent tasks to support the front was finally completed. Under normal circumstances, it would take more than a month to complete this batch of tasks. In the past four months, the factory has completed a total of 143 tasks to support the front.

### 工具当刀枪  工厂作战场  生产支前方  厦门鹭光橡胶厂产值猛增五倍

    工具当刀枪  工厂作战场  生产支前方
    厦门鹭光橡胶厂产值猛增五倍
    本报讯  厦门鹭光橡胶厂，在对敌斗争中一面英勇地坚持生产，一面大力支前，取得了出色的成绩。今年9至12月四个月所完成的产值等于过去八个月产值的132％。全年产值比去年增加了五倍多。
    厦门鹭光橡胶厂是1956年才发展起来的一个工厂。当时，全厂只有几台破旧不堪的炼胶机和十三个工人，只能生产钢笔皮囊和胶鞋底等小杂品，年产值只有二十四万二千元，而现在已经有一千二百多个工人，年产三百万双胶鞋和二万套车胎的新式设备能力的综合性橡胶工厂。
    今年8月，当美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区发起战争挑衅的消息传到这个工厂时，全厂职工无比愤怒，纷纷集会声讨美蒋军事挑衅罪行和揭穿美蒋企图挑起战争的阴谋。工人们决心化愤怒为力量，提出：“工具当刀枪、工厂作战场，创造生产新成绩，绞死美蒋野心狼”的战斗口号，迅速投入高产竞赛，掀起一个一面坚持生产、一面支前的高潮。
    由于这个工厂的工人们这样英勇地坚持着生产，越干越猛，月产值由9月份的一百零七万元一直上升到12月份的一百八十五万元，并且提前在12月20日完成了比去年增加五倍多的年度生产跃进计划。
    这个工厂在坚持生产完成国家计划的同时，还出色地完成了支前任务。工人们说：“前线需要什么，我们就给什么，什么时候要，就什么时候给！”坚决完成一切支前任务。一次，空军某部急需一种特殊的橡胶制品。厂里接到这个任务后，立刻召开技术人员和技术工人会议，研究完成这批任务的办法，并且立刻投入行动。当时，没有模型也没有图纸，厂里便马上组织人员一边设计绘图，一边配合厦门机修厂通宵赶制模型。经过二十小时的苦战，终于完成了这批紧急的支前任务。如按通常情况，要完成这批任务，得要一个多月时间。四个多月来，该厂共完成一百四十三件支前任务。
