    Regarding "Distribution According to Labor" and "Distribution According to Needs"
    Zhang Zhongshi
    The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" revised the previously used translations of "each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to "each according to his ability, distribution according to labor," and "each according to his ability, each according to his needs" to "each according to his ability, distribution according to needs." Why were these changes made?
    The phrase "distribution according to labor" first appeared in Stalin's works. In Russian it is: "Каждому по его труду." ("Stalin's Collected Works," Vol. 13, Russian edition, p. 118)
    The German translation is: "Jedem nach seiner Leistung." ("Stalin's Collected Works," Vol. 13, German edition, p. 105)
    The English translation is: "To each according to his work." ("Stalin's Collected Works," Vol. 13, English edition, p. 120)
    In the past, this phrase had the following three translations in our country: "each takes what he is worth," "to each according to his work," and "to each according to his labor." Among them, the translation "each takes what he is worth" is obviously wrong, as the original text does not have this meaning. If the laborers distributed all the value they created, how could there be accumulation and expanded reproduction? The translation "to each according to his work" later became more popular, but it is also not accurate enough because it does not express the original meaning that each person is paid or distributed a certain reward (rather than each person taking the reward themselves).
    The phrase "distribution according to needs" was written by Marx in the German edition of "Critique of the Gotha Program" as: "Jedem nach seiner Bedürfnissen!" (See "Critique of the Gotha Program," 1946 German edition, p. 21)
    The Russian translation is: "Каждому по потребностям!" (See "Marx-Engels Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 15, p. 275, "Critique of the Gotha Program")
    The English translation is: "To each according to his needs!" (See "Critique of the Gotha Program," 1954 English edition, p. 27)
    According to existing materials, this phrase was translated into Chinese as "each takes what he needs" in the 1907 "New Century" (published in Paris) and in the sixth issue of "New World" (subtitle "Socialist Magazine," published in Guangzhou) on July 28, 1912. Sun Yat-sen also used this translation in a speech on "The Categories and Methods of Socialism" on October 15, 1912. This translation has been commonly used ever since.
    The disadvantage of the translation "each takes what he needs" is similar to that of "to each according to his work," and even more serious. According to the original text and the translations in the aforementioned foreign languages, the meaning of this sentence is "given according to needs," which is based on society as the main body, not the individual. Giving according to needs still requires organized and planned distribution by society; it does not mean that each person can directly go to a warehouse to take whatever they need, or however much they need, without any distribution plan, as the phrase "each takes what he needs" might imply.
    "Distribution according to labor" is the principle of distribution in the first stage of communism—the socialist stage. It is adapted to the socialist production situation. Because in the socialist stage, social productive forces have not yet developed greatly, social products have not yet become extremely abundant, the essential differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, mental and physical labor have not yet been eliminated, and people's communist consciousness has not yet been greatly raised. Under such circumstances, socialist countries must adopt the principle of distribution according to labor, which generally means distribution according to the quantity and quality of each worker's labor. Lenin said in "The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution": "Mankind can only transition directly from capitalism to socialism, that is, to the common ownership of the means of production and the distribution of products according to each person's work." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Vol. 24, Russian edition, p. 62) Therefore, adopting the translation "distribution according to labor" is in line with the original meaning.
    "Distribution according to needs" is the principle of distribution in the advanced stage of communism. It is adapted to the communist production situation. In the advanced stage of communism, social productive forces have developed greatly, social products have become extremely abundant, and the differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and mental and physical labor have been basically eliminated, and the communist consciousness of the masses of people has been greatly raised. At this time, society will be able to distribute according to each person's needs, and it will no longer be necessary to stipulate the amount of product each person receives based on the amount of labor each person contributes. From this, it can be seen that translating it as "distribution according to needs" is also in line with the original meaning.
    The translations "distribution according to labor" and "distribution according to needs" are not as symmetrical to "each according to his ability" as the original text, but this is a relatively minor issue. It is not easy to find two sentences that do not lose the original meaning and are symmetrical to "each according to his ability"; and the two sentences "distribution according to labor" and "distribution according to needs" also have the advantage of being symmetrical to each other and easy to compare. In order not to sacrifice the meaning for the sake of words and cause misunderstanding, it is correct and necessary to change to the current translation.

    关于“按劳分配”和“按需分配”
    张仲实
    中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”里面，将过去习用的译语“各尽所能，按劳取酬”改为“各尽所能，按劳分配”，“各尽所能，各取所需”改为“各尽所能，按需分配”。为什么要作这种修改呢？
    “按劳分配”一语，最早是见于斯大林的著作。俄文是：“Каждому  по  его  труду．”（“斯大林全集”第13卷，俄文版第118页）
    德文译为：“Jedem nach seiner Leistung．”（“斯大林全集”第13卷，德文版第105页）
    英文译为：“To each according to his work．”（“斯大林全集”第13卷，英文版第120页）
    此语，我国过去有下列三种译法：“各取所值”，“按劳取酬”，“按劳付酬”。其中“各取所值”的译法显然是错误的，原文并没有这样的意思。如果劳动者把所创造的价值都分掉了，那怎么还能有积累，还能进行扩大再生产呢？“按劳取酬”的译法后来比较流行，但是也不够确切，因为它没有表达出原文中各人是被付给、被分配以一定报酬（而不是各人自己去分取报酬）的意思。
    “按需分配”一语，马克思在德文版“哥达纲领批判”中是这样写的：“Jedem nach seiner Bedürfnissen！”（见“哥达纲领批判”1946年德文版第21页）
    俄文译为：“Каждому  по  потребностям！”（见马恩全集俄文版第15卷第275页“哥达纲领批判”）
    英文译为：“To each according to his needs！”（见“哥达纲领批判”1954年英文版第27页）
    此语的中文译法，根据现有材料，1907年的“新世纪报”（在巴黎出版），1912年7月28日的“新世界”第六期（副题“社会主义杂志”，在广州出版）即译为“各取所需”。1912年10月15日孙中山在一次关于“社会主义之派别与方法”的讲演中亦采用这个译法。以后一直通用这个译法。
    “各取所需”的译法的缺点同“按劳取酬”相类似，而且更为严重。这句话按照原文和上引的几种外国语言的译文，意思本来是说“按需要给予”，是以社会为主体来说的，不是以个人为主体来说的。按需要给予，仍然要经过社会的有组织有计划的分配；并不是说，各人需要什么，需要多少，就可以不通过任何分配计划，直接到某个仓库里去随便取出什么，取出多少，像“各取所需”这句话所可能暗示的那样。
    “按劳分配”是共产主义第一阶段——社会主义阶段的分配原则。它是同社会主义的生产情况相适应的。因为在社会主义阶段上，社会生产力还没有极大地发展，社会产品还没有极大地丰富，城市和乡村、工人和农民、脑力劳动和体力劳动等之间的本质的差别还没有消灭，人们的共产主义觉悟还没有极大地提高。在这种情况下，社会主义国家必须采取按劳动分配的原则，一般地说来，也就是按每个工作者劳动的数量和质量进行分配的原则。列宁在“无产阶级在我国革命中的任务”一文里边说道：“人类从资本主义只能直接过渡到社会主义，即过渡到生产资料的公有和按照每人的工作分配产品。”（“列宁全集”第24卷，俄文版62页）因此，采用“按劳分配”的译法，是符合原意的。
    “按需分配”是共产主义高级阶段的分配原则。它是同共产主义的生产情况相适应的。在共产主义的高级阶段上，社会生产力极大地发展了，社会产品极大地丰富了，城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动差别基本上消灭了，人民群众的共产主义觉悟极大地提高了。这时，社会就有可能按每个人的需要进行分配，不需要再根据每个人劳动的多少来规定每个人所得产品的多少了。由此可见，译成“按需分配”也是符合原意的。
    “按劳分配”和“按需分配”的译法，从文字上说没有像原文那样同“各尽所能”相对称，但是这是一个比较次要的问题。要找两句不失原意而又同“各尽所能”相对称的话很不容易；而“按劳分配”和“按需分配”两句话也还有本身互相对称、便于比较的好处。为了不致以词害意，引起误解，改用现在的译法是正确的，必要的。
