Xinhua News Agency, December 19th -- TASS reports: Soviet Antarctic pilots, braving severe weather and overcoming numerous difficulties, rescued four Belgian expedition members in distress in Antarctica on the 16th after their plane crashed.

On December 12th, after the Soviet Antarctic Continental Expedition Team received a distress call from Belgian Antarctic expedition personnel, they immediately decided to send a team led by Berov, the captain of the Soviet Antarctic Air Force, to carry out the rescue.

At 17:00 Moscow time on the 12th, Berov and others, piloting a "Li-2" aircraft, left the Soviet Antarctic research base "Mirny" in severe weather to head for the Belgian "King Baudouin" research station in Antarctica.

After several days of adventurous searching, the Soviet pilots finally discovered the four people in distress at 1:35 AM Moscow time on the 16th and transported them back to the Belgian "King Baudouin" station.

People from all walks of life in Belgium have been closely following the heroic actions of the Soviet pilots for several days. On the 16th, all Belgian newspapers reported the news of the Soviet pilots' heroic rescue of the Belgian personnel in distress on their front pages with large headlines.

On the 16th, King Baudouin of Belgium sent a telegram to Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, warmly praising the fearless spirit of the Soviet Antarctic expedition team. De Gerlache, the captain of the Belgian Antarctic expedition team who was rescued by the Soviets, telegraphed Tolstikov, the captain of the Soviet Third Antarctic Expedition Team, expressing his deep gratitude. The telephone at the Soviet Embassy in Belgium has been ringing non-stop since the morning of the 16th, with Belgian citizens from all walks of life calling to ask them to convey their thanks to the Soviet pilots.

    据新华社19日讯  据塔斯社消息：苏联南极飞行员冒着恶劣天气克服重重困难，在16日救出了四位在南极因飞机失事遇险的比利时考察队人员。
    12月12日，苏联南极大陆考察队接获比利时南极考察人员的求救呼吁后，立即决定派出以苏联南极航空队队长别罗夫为首的一批人员前往救援。
    12日莫斯科时间十七点，别罗夫等驾驶一架“利二”式飞机冒着恶劣的天气离开苏联南极考察基地“和平”村，前往比利时设在南极的“博杜安国王”考察站。
    经过几天的冒险探索，苏联飞行员终于在16日莫斯科时间清晨一点三十五分发现了这四位遇险者，把他们载运回比利时的“博杜安国王”站。
    比利时各界人士几天来一直密切注视着苏联飞行员的英雄行动。16日比利时各报都在头版以大字标题报道了苏联飞行员英勇救援比利时遇险人员出险消息。
    比利时国王博杜安16日给苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫发了一封电报，热烈赞扬苏联南极考察队人员的大无畏精神。被苏联人救出的比利时南极考察队队长德热尔拉什，打电报给苏联第三南极考察队队长托尔斯季科夫，表示深深感谢。苏联驻比利时大使馆的电话从16日清晨起就一直没有闲过，比利时各界公民纷纷打电话请他们转达对苏联飞行员的谢意。
