    Rely on Our Own Efforts to Vigorously Run "Small-Scale Native Integrated Iron and Steel Enterprises"
    The CCP Macheng County Committee
    Steel, Iron, Equipment, Materials - Everything is Available
    Under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committee, our county has achieved a bumper harvest in both industry and agriculture this year. Since the implementation of the "small-scale native groups" policy in steel production, a mass production movement has been launched vigorously. By the beginning of December, the county had produced more than 30,000 tons of iron and more than 1,000 tons of steel. In terms of agricultural production, grain production has increased nearly doubled compared to last year; cotton production has increased more than doubled compared to last year; and other diversified economies have also experienced significant development.
    In order to promote the mechanization and electrification of industrial and agricultural production, our county plans to build native railways, manufacture native train cars, small-scale universal tractors, and various agricultural machinery in 1959. It is estimated that this will require more than 10,000 tons of steel. Where will so much steel come from? We believe that we cannot rely entirely on the state for assistance. We should rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts, use our own smelted steel to roll various types of steel materials, and solve the problem of having steel but lacking the necessary materials.
    If we want to build a factory, how should we build it? How do we solve the series of problems such as machinery and equipment, technical personnel, and so on? We believe that large-scale and foreign-made equipment is good, but the technology is complex, equipment is lacking, and there are many difficulties, making it difficult to quickly implement in rural areas. Therefore, we decided to first establish a small-scale, integrated iron and steel enterprise combining native and foreign methods in the "May Fourth" People's Commune to gain experience and promote it comprehensively.
    Indeed, establishing a comprehensive small-scale iron and steel enterprise in a people's commune, encompassing iron smelting, steelmaking, forging, steel rolling, and metal products, is a new undertaking that we have never done before. After breaking down superstitions and liberating our minds, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, and with the specific help and guidance of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Provincial Department of Metallurgy, we fully relied on and leveraged the wisdom and strength of the broad masses, overcame all difficulties, and finally built a small-scale, integrated iron and steel enterprise combining native and foreign methods with an annual output of 2,500 tons of iron, 1,500 tons of steel, and 1,200 tons of steel materials in just seven days. The smelting, rolling, and metal products workshops were officially put into production on November 14th.

    Mobilize the Masses, Rely on Our Own Efforts
    Why were we able to build a "small-scale native integrated enterprise" in just seven days? Our specific approach was:
    1. Rely on the Masses, Joint Operations. The construction of the small-scale iron and steel enterprise was a major event for the 700,000 people of our county. It was truly a time of "boiling enthusiasm and universal joy." During the days of construction, the County Party Committee took personal command, seized the broad masses' demands for industrialization and mechanization, and their enthusiasm for building socialism, deeply mobilized the masses, and adopted the method of "national mobilization, joint operations, and joint collaboration of all departments" to ensure the timely completion of the steel plant. Commune members and government officials actively participated in the factory construction. Commune members moved ancient tombs to level the foundation, uprooted cotton stalks, and built factory buildings. The construction company mobilized more than a hundred workers to carry out a major competition in civil engineering, completing the construction of the 900-square-meter factory building two days ahead of schedule. The workers' labor efficiency increased by a factor of one. Employees of the post and telecommunications bureau were busy erecting power lines, the bus station rushed to deliver materials day and night, and the employees of the hydropower station even supported the steel plant with the only telecommunications equipment in the warehouse. This is truly the power of the masses, as great as a mountain.
    2. Rely on Our Own Efforts to Overcome Difficulties. In running an integrated iron and steel enterprise, the iron-smelting furnaces and steelmaking furnaces are easy to solve, but solving the rolling equipment and processing equipment is more difficult. First of all, we thank the older worker brothers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company for rushing to manufacture the first "Commune" universal rolling mill for us amidst their busy schedules. We also, in the spirit of self-reliance, mobilized the employees of the county's agricultural machinery factory to build wooden rope-twisting machines, wire-drawing machines, and nail-making machines. In the production process, the first difficulty encountered was technical. Everyone had not only never done it before, but had never even seen it. After the technicians learned, made, and modified at the same time, they overcame the technical difficulties and successfully trial-produced wire-drawing machines, rope-twisting machines, nail-making machines, and so on. After the workers made these machines, they became bolder and gained experience, and further trial-produced drop hammers. On this basis, we began to trial-produce the "Commune" rolling mill. After eight days of hard work, overcoming various difficulties, a brand-new rolling mill was successfully trial-produced.
    3. Make Do with Whatever is Available, Build the Factory Frugally. While building the factory, we organized a transportation team of 470 people and a sand-washing team of 155 people. On the third day of construction, the roof was being built above, and molten iron was flowing below. Factory construction and production were carried out in parallel. At the same time, from beginning to end, we adhered to the principle of using whatever was available and spending less money to do more things. After the factory was built, the workers had to be housed together. It was impossible to build dormitories for more than 100 people in a few days, not to mention that it would cost a lot of money. Our solution to this problem was to set up the factory near Maojia Lane when choosing the factory site. Some workers lived at home, and other workers temporarily borrowed housing from commune members. The problem of housing was solved. The workshop was originally going to be built with concrete flooring, but it would cost a lot of money and be too slow. After everyone's discussion, we decided not to use concrete flooring, but to put the machines on wooden piers, and they were installed in one day, which was both economical and fast.

    Organize Competitions, Do a Good Job in Production
    The "small-scale native integrated enterprise" has only been in production for one month since it was completed and put into operation. As of the 9th of this month, it has produced more than 75,000 catties of iron, more than 68,000 catties of steel, more than 2,600 catties of flat steel, more than 700 catties of square steel, more than 3,200 catties of steel plates, and other metal products such as steel wire and wire nails.
    In production, we also implemented the mass line. First, we put politics in command, mobilized the masses, carried out rectification movements, and improved the masses' ideological awareness, which in turn promoted production. In the rectification, we mainly combined the method of accounting and comparison to make the masses realize the political and economic significance of the "small-scale native integrated enterprise," to recognize that the "small-scale native integrated enterprise" is the way to solve the problem of having steel but lacking materials, is the material foundation for realizing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture and taking steel as the key link to promote the industrialization of the commune. While grasping political and ideological work, we also paid attention to the lives and welfare of the employees, further encouraged the enthusiasm of the employees, and ensured the increasing growth of production.
    Then, on the basis of the masses' increased awareness, we launched a communist great competition, and in the competition, we put forward the battle slogans of "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced" and "produce more steel (materials), produce steel (materials) faster, and seize every second," pushing production to a climax step by step. The rolling mill had high production efficiency, but the forging of steel ingots had low production efficiency, so it could not keep up. One day, the rolling mill team sent a big-character poster to the forging team:
    The rolling mill is hungry,
    Only because the forging output is low;
    Liberate your mind and work hard,
    Increase production and strive for first place.
    After discussion, the forging team studied ways to improve and also wrote a big-character poster to launch a communist competition with the rolling mill team:
    Rolling mill, don't worry,
    Production guarantees you have something to eat;
    Let's compare,
    See who increases production the most.
    The forging team took many measures to continuously improve the technology and actively learn to master the drop hammer. The output increased fivefold. The rolling mill team also changed the heating furnace to a reverberatory furnace, and the work efficiency was also increased by 50%.
    Rapidly training various technical workers such as iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, wire drawing, and nail making from the peasants is a major measure for early normal production after the factory is built. We paid attention to grasping this work from the beginning of the factory construction. Under the specific guidance of the technicians of the Hubei Iron and Steel Plant, the cadres took the lead, studied and practiced hard, learned while working, and cultivated a large number of technical workers. At the same time, we also adopted the methods of master teaching apprentice, skilled workers teaching novices, running red and expert universities, on-site training, and integrating theory with practice, and carried out the movement of versatile all-rounders by inviting in and sending out. And put forward the slogan: "The workshop is the classroom, and the front of the machine furnace is the battlefield," "People refine iron, steel refines people." Under the influence of the leadership's example, the new workers quickly mastered the operating skills. Many people have achieved five skills: the smelting worker can use tongs, hammer, pull the bellows, stir the rod, and配料 (pei liao - proportion ingredients); the rolling worker can roll steel, start the machine, heat up,掌盘(zhang pan - control the roller), and handle accidents.
    We also applied the method of cultivating experimental plots in agricultural production in the factory. Leading cadres and workers cooperated, everyone learned technology, everyone ran experimental plots, and boldly carried out technical innovation movements on the basis of preliminary mastery of technology, and rapidly pushed production to a new stage. The steelmaking workers proposed the red water hot charging method for low-temperature steelmaking. The experiment was successful at the end of November, and it has now been vigorously adopted, with significant results. It improves work efficiency by one time, saves fuel by 50%, and reduces costs by 20%. The "July 1st" blast furnace workers proposed "six reforms" to the furnace, making the daily output of the blast furnace break the 10,000-jin mark. The forging steel workers proposed "four reforms," which improved work efficiency by one time, and so on. These are just the sprouts of the mass technical revolution of the "small-scale native integrated enterprise," and will soon bear rich fruits. On the basis of full discussion among the masses, we also established production management systems such as handover shifts, production plans, labor quotas, product acceptance, raw (fuel) material receiving and returning, technical operation points, and rewards and punishments, and frequently summarized advanced experiences, promoted them in a timely manner, discovered problems, and solved them in a timely manner, thereby ensuring the rapid transition of production to normal.
    The completion of the Fenghuangwo Iron and Steel Plant of the "May Fourth" People's Commune marks a new stage in the iron and steel industrial production of our county. From then on, it has changed the situation of our county having steel but lacking materials, and paved a broad path for the development of our county's iron and steel industry and the realization of the simultaneous development of industrial and agricultural production.

    自力更生大办“小土联”
    中共麻城县委员会
    钢、铁、器、材样样俱全
    在上级党委的正确领导下，我县今年工农业双双丰收。钢铁生产贯彻“小土群”的方针以来，群众性的生产运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来了，到12月初止，全县已产生铁三万多吨，钢一千多吨。在农业生产方面，粮食比去年增长将近一倍；棉花比去年增长二倍多；其他多种经济也有了很大的发展。
    为了促进工农业生产的机械化、电气化，我县1959年计划修建土铁路、制造土火车箱和小型万能拖拉机以及各种农业机械。这样做，估计需钢材万吨以上。这么多的钢材，从哪儿来呢？我们认为，不能完全伸手向国家要，应该依靠群众、自力更生，用自己炼的钢铁，自己轧制各种钢材，解决有钢无材的困难。
    要建厂，怎样建？机器设备、技术人材等等这一系列的问题，怎样解决？我们认为，大的洋的好是好，但是技术复杂，设备缺乏，困难较多，在农村不容易很快搞起来。于是我们就决定先在“五四”人民公社搞一个小型的土洋结合的钢铁联合企业，创造经验，全面推广。
    的确，要在一个人民公社建立一座从炼铁、炼钢到锻制、轧钢及金属制品等综合性的小型钢铁联合企业，是我们 从来没有干过的新事情。经过破除迷信、解放思想，在上级党委的领导下，在冶金工业部和省冶金厅的具体帮助和指导下，充分依靠和发挥了广大群众的智慧和力量，排除了一切困难，在短短的七天时间内，终于建成了一座年产生铁二千五百吨、钢一千五百吨、钢材一千二百吨的小型土洋结合的钢铁联合企业。冶炼轧钢、金属制品等三个车间于11月14日正式投入了生产。
    发动群众，自力更生
    为什么能在短短的七天时间内建成一个“小土联”呢？我们的具体做法是：
    一、依靠群众，联合作战。小型钢铁联合企业的兴建，是我县七十万人民的一件大喜事，真是“万心沸腾、全民皆欢”。在建厂的那几天，县委亲自挂帅，抓住广大群众实现工业化、机械化的要求和建设社会主义的热情，深入地发动群众，并采取“全民大动员、联合大作战、各部门共同协作”的方法来保证钢厂按时建成。公社群众和机关干部都积极投入了建厂工作。公社社员们，迁古墓平地基、拔棉秆、建厂房；建筑公司发动百多名工人开展土木工大竞赛，提前二天完成了九百平方公尺的厂房建筑，工人们的劳动效率比以前提高了一倍。邮电局职工忙着架电线，汽车站星夜赶送物资，水电站的职工还把仓库仅有的电讯器材都支援了钢铁厂，这真是群众力量大如山。
    二、自力更生，克服困难。搞钢铁联合企业，炼铁炉、炼钢炉都好解决，解决轧钢设备和加工设备就比较困难。我们首先感谢武汉钢铁公司工人老大哥在百忙中给我们赶制了第一台“公社号万能轧钢机”，我们又本着自力更生的精神，发动本县的农业机械厂职工自造木制的捻绳机、拔丝机、制钉机。在制作过程中，首先碰到的是技术上的困难，大家不但没有做过，连见也没见过。经过技工们边学边做边改，克服了技术上的重重困难，试制成功了拔丝机、捻绳机、制钉机等等。工人们作了这些机器以后，胆量更大了，也有了经验，进一步又试制成落锤。我们在此基础上，又开始试制“公社号”轧钢机。经过八天的苦战，克服了种种困难，一台崭新的轧钢机试制成功了。
    三、因陋就简、勤俭建厂。我们在建厂的同时，组织了四百七十人的运输大队，一百五十五人的淘沙连。建厂第三天，上边在盖屋顶，下边就流出了铁水。建厂、生产并行，同时自始至终我们本着有什么用什么，少花钱多办事的原则进行建设。工厂建起来了，工人要集中住宿，几天时间根本盖不起一百多人住的宿舍，何况又要花很多钱。我们解决这个问题的办法是，在选厂址的时候，就把厂子设在毛家巷附近，一部分工人住在家里，另一部分工人临时借住社员家里。住的问题解决了。车间本来要打洋灰地，可是一来花钱多，二来太慢，经过大家讨论，我们就不打洋灰地，把机器架在木墩上，一天就安装好了，又省又快。
    组织竞赛  搞好生产
   “小土联”从建成投入生产到现在仅有一个月的时间，到本月9日止，已产铁七万五千多斤，钢六万八千多斤，扁钢二千六百多斤，方钢七百多斤，钢板三千二百多斤以及其他钢丝、洋钉等金属制品。
    在生产上，我们也贯彻了群众路线。先是政治挂帅，发动群众，开展整风运动，提高了群众的思想觉悟，进而推动了生产。在整风中主要结合算账对比办法使群众认识到“小土联”的政治意义和“经济意义”，认识到“小土联”是解决有钢无材，恨钢不成材的途径，是实现工农业同时并举与以钢为纲，促进公社工业化的物质基础。在抓政治思想工作的同时，我们还注意关心了职工的生活福利，进一步鼓舞了职工的干劲，保证了生产的日益增长。
    我们接着又在群众觉悟提高的基础上，开展共产主义大竞赛，在竞赛中提出“学先进、赶先进、超先进”和“多出钢（材）铁、快出钢（材）铁、分秒必争”的战斗口号，把生产一步步推向高潮。轧钢机生产效率高，锻制钢锭生产效率低，老是供应不上。一天轧钢小组给锻制小组送去一张大字报：
    轧钢机，饿肚皮，
    只因锻制产量低；
    解放思想快努力，
    提高产量争第一。
    锻制小组讨论后，研究改进办法，也写了一张大字报，向轧钢小组开展共产主义竞赛：
    轧钢机莫着急，
    生产保你有吃的；
    不信我们比一比，
    看谁增产数第一。
    锻制小组采取许多措施不断地改进技术，并积极地学习掌握落锤，产量翻了五番，轧钢小组也将加热炉改成了反射炉，工效也提高50％。
    从农民中，迅速的培养出炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、拔丝、制钉等各种技术工人，是建厂后早日正常生产的重大措施。我们开始建厂就注意抓这一工作，在湖北钢铁厂技工的具体指导下，干部带头，苦学苦练，边作边学，大量培养技术工人。同时还采取师傅带徒弟、熟手带生手、大办红专大学、现场训练、理论联系实际，用请进来派出去的方法开展多面手万能人运动。并提出：“车间是课堂、机器炉前是战场”“人炼铁，钢炼人”的口号。新工人在领导带头影响下，迅速地掌握了操作技术。不少人做到了五会：冶炼工会掌钳、会打锤、会拉风箱、会掌搅棍、会配料；轧钢工会轧钢、会开机器、会加热、会掌盘、会处理事故。
    我们还在工厂里运用农业生产种试验田的办法，领导干部和工人合作，人人学技术，个个办试验田，大胆地在初步掌握技术的基础上开展技术革新运动，迅速地把生产推向一个新的阶段。炼钢工人提出红水热装法低温炼钢，11月底试验成功，现已大力采用，效果很显著，提高工效一倍，节约燃料50％，成本可降低20％；“七一”高炉工人对炉子提出“六改”，使高炉日产突破万斤关；锻钢工人提出“四改”，提高工效一倍等。这些仅仅是“小土联”群众性技术革命的萌芽，不久将会结出丰硕的果实。在群众充分讨论的基础上，我们还建立了交接班、生产计划、劳动定额、产品验收，原（燃）料领退、技术操作要点和奖惩等生产管理制度，并经常总结先进经验，及时推广，发现问题，及时解决，从而保证了生产的迅速转入正常。
      “五四”人民公社凤凰窝钢铁厂的建成，标志着我县钢铁工业生产进入了一个新的阶段，从此改变了我县有钢无材、恨钢不成材的局面，为发展我县钢铁工业与实现工农业生产并举开辟了广阔的途径。（附图片）
