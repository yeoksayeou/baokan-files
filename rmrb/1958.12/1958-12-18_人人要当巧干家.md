During the Great Leap Forward, the slogan put forward by the people of Dengfeng was: "Dare to think, dare to do, do cleverly, do practically." The two words "do cleverly" could not have been better.

The people praise clever work the most. Skillful hands, skillful feet, skillful strength, skillful energy, skillful girls, skillful daughters-in-law, skilled craftsmen, and ingenious workmanship are all praised and emulated by the people. It tells us that whatever work we do, we should be "clever"; only with "cleverness" can we accomplish great things. Haven't the many miracles that have emerged since the Great Leap Forward been inseparable from clever work? Due to the vigorous development of steelmaking, the labor force was lacking, so the masses came up with clever methods to realize cart transportation and eliminate carrying on shoulders; the carts were too heavy, and the sub-labor force could not push them, so the masses came up with clever methods to improve them, realizing pneumatic tires and ball bearings; because coarse fertilizer was too laborious, the masses could come up with clever methods to create chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer. The masses can also think of "less planting, better planting, high yield" in grain fields that are "gardenized." Even the small matter of cutting vegetables in the canteen, the masses want to implement indigenous mechanization. Such things are too numerous to mention. The people are the most aware of the great significance of clever work.

To build socialism in our country as soon as possible, it is necessary to increase productivity tenfold, twentyfold, or even a hundredfold. The method to be adopted is clever work. Clever work is to improve tools, improve operations and organization methods, so that more work can be done in the same amount of time and the labor force can be reduced to complete the same task. Clever work, in a nutshell, is the "technical revolution" proposed by the Party Central Committee.

Clever work and reckless work are completely different. Reckless work advocates relying on strength, pushing 300 catties, carrying 200 catties, working day and night. This kind of courage and enthusiasm is worthy of praise. But this kind of way of doing things is not a long-term solution. To work hard and delve into things is the long-term solution. People's energy is always limited. Let's say you work fourteen hours a day, pushing 300 catties, for ten days and nights, but what about after that? You're out of energy, what do you do then? You'll have to rest if you get sick from exhaustion. Building socialism is not a matter of three or two days. It's okay to rush for two or three days when work is tight; but from a long-term perspective, it's not a solution to always do this. But some cadres still can't figure this out. They worry and say: "My goodness, how can we complete the task without rushing at night!" In fact, the masses understand. They say: "Don't look at rushing day and night, you're not actually getting anything done." There is a saying in Dengfeng: "Move a mountain lightly." There is also an old Chinese saying: "Four ounces can move a thousand pounds." This all means that as long as you think of a clever method and use skillful strength, even if you exert little effort, you can move a big mountain and move a thousand pounds.

Clever work must resolutely oppose conservatism. Conservatives do not believe in various clever methods. They look at this and say, "This, I'm afraid it won't work, right?"; they look at that and say, "This, uh..." shaking their heads. They are doing things lifelessly, sticking to conventions. Clever work is about thinking of better new methods from old methods, so they are always opposed, and we must resolutely oppose these deadly enemies. Some people only advocate hard work but do not believe in clever work. Naturally, they have a positive and enthusiastic side, but they also have a conservative side, that is, they do not believe in "cleverness." In fact, only "cleverness" is a good way to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

Clever work is not equal to random work. It's not about just thinking of a method on a whim and doing it, regardless of how the method is. Rather, it is about overcoming many difficulties and fully researching to make the method "clever." It is "practice makes perfect," not "raw makes perfect." It is necessary to first go through practice, understand the characteristics of things, study various conditions, and master the laws of things themselves, that is, to analyze the main contradictions of things and the main aspects of contradictions. Only in this way can we "become clever." Therefore, to work cleverly, we must oppose "lazy people." Lazy people say: "Farming, needless to say, do what others do." These people are like wheels, moving when pushed, turning when prodded. It is impossible to rely on them to build socialism. We must oppose lazy people, advocate clever work, and advocate that everyone become a clever worker.

    人人要当巧干家
    何继光
    在大跃进中，登封人民提出的口号是：“敢想、敢干、巧干、实干”。这“巧干”二字提得再好也没有了。
    人民群众是最赞扬巧干的。巧手、巧脚、巧力、巧劲、巧姑娘、巧媳妇、能工巧匠、巧夺天工，这些都是被人民群众所称颂、所仿效的。它告诉我们无论干什么工作，都应该“巧”；只有“巧”，才能干大事。大跃进以来所出现的许多奇迹，不都是与巧干分不开的吗？由于大搞钢铁，劳动力缺少了，群众就想出巧法，实现车子化消灭肩挑；车子太沉，次劳力推不动，群众就又想巧法改进它，实现胶皮化和滚珠轴承；由于粗肥太费力，群众就能想巧法大造化肥、菌肥。群众还能想出“种得少，种得好，产量高”的粮田“田园化”。甚至食堂里切菜这件小事，群众也要想法实行土制机械化。诸如这些，举不胜举。人民群众是最能知道巧干的重大意义的。
    要尽快地在我国建成社会主义，就要求十倍、二十倍，以至百倍地提高生产率，采取的办法就是巧干。巧干就是要改进工具，改进操作和组织方法，使在同样的时间内干更多的活和完成同样的任务而减少劳力。巧干，一句话说穿了，就是党中央所提出的四个大字“技术革命”。
    巧干和蛮干完全不同。蛮干主张凭力气，推它三百斤，挑它二百斤，没日没夜的干。这种勇气，这种热情，是值得赞扬的。但这种干的办法，却非长远之计。要干劲加钻劲，这才是长远之计。人的精力总是有限的，就说你一天干十四个小时，推它三百斤，干上十昼夜，但是以后呢？没劲啦，又怎么办呢？累病了还得休养。建设社会主义并不是三天两日的事，工作紧了，突击两三天，何尝不可；但从长远打算，老是这样就不是办法了。可是有的干部对这点还想不通，他们发愁的说：“我的老天爷，黑夜不突击咋能完成任务！”其实，群众可通啦。他们说：“别看连天彻夜的赶，实际不出活。”登封有句俗语叫：“轻来轻去搬座山。”中国还有句老话叫：“四两拨千斤”。这都是说，只要你想巧法，使巧劲，纵然你出力小也能搬大山，拨千斤。
    巧干必须坚决反对保守。保守主义者对于各种巧办法都不信。他们看看这个，说：“这，怕不中吧？”；看看那个，说：“这，嗯……”摇摇头。他们是死气沉沉的干，墨守成规的干。巧干就是从旧办法想出更好的新办法，所以他们总是反对的，我们必须坚决反对这些死对头。有些只主张苦干，而不相信巧干的人，自然有他积极热情的一面，但也有保守的一面，这就是不相信“巧”，其实只有“巧”才是达到多快好省的好办法。
    巧干不等于乱干。不是随随便便心血来潮想起一个办法就干，也不管办法如何。而是要克服许多困难，充分研究，使想出来的办法达到“巧”。是“熟能生巧”，而不是“生能生巧”。要首先经过实践，了解事物的特性，研究各种条件，掌握事物本身的规律，也就是要分析事物的主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，只有这样，才能“生巧”。所以，要巧干就必须反对“懒汉”。懒汉说：“庄稼活，不用说，人家咋做咱咋做。”这种人就像车轱辘，推推动动，拨拨转转，指望他们来建设社会主义是不行的。必须反对懒汉，提倡巧干，提倡人人成为巧干家。
