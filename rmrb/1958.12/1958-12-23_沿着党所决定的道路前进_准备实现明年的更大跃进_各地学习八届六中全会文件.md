Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: Jiangxi, Qinghai, Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hunan and other provinces have swiftly taken measures to implement the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and are launching a large-scale movement to study and publicize the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session.

In Jiangxi Province, the staff of the ten-thousand-person inspection team for rectifying and consolidating the people's commune organizations immediately conducted serious study and discussion after the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" was published in the newspapers. Party organizations at all levels have quickly deployed current work in accordance with the spirit of this resolution. The Nanchang and Jiujiang local committees have respectively convened telephone conferences and cadre meetings to discuss and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session. The Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has issued a notice to conduct in-depth study.

On December 16th, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of secretaries of prefectural and county committees to convey and discuss the spirit of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and studied the current work of the province in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions. The Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, the Governor of Qinghai Province, and others also gave reports on the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" to 150,000 Xining citizens in more than thirty locations on December 19th.

The Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Yunnan Provincial Party Committees have all issued instructions, requiring the party committees at all levels under their jurisdiction to conscientiously study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.

The Hebei Provincial Party Committee, after the release of the communique and resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, immediately issued a notice to party committees at all levels throughout the province, requiring them to organize cadres to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions and research on the resolutions, combining them with current production and living problems and the problems that have emerged since the people's communeization, to correctly understand the current situation, to clarify the theoretical issues of realizing the two transitions (the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and the transition from socialism to communism) and the preparations that should be made, and to deeply understand a series of policy issues related to the people's communes. After clarifying various issues, the party committees of each commune will launch propaganda to the broad masses, and use this propaganda as the center to launch a high tide of communist ideological education movement, so as to make full ideological preparations for vigorously doing a good job in the current production and living problems of the commune and consolidating the people's commune.

The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee instructed party committees at all levels throughout the province to launch a large-scale movement to study and publicize the resolutions and related documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party from now until April next year. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out in its instructions that the "Communique" released and the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have great historical significance both in theory and in practice. Party committees at all levels should organize all cadres to conscientiously study the resolutions and related documents of the Sixth Plenary Session, and combine them with the specific conditions of each locality to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity to the people. Through study and publicity, further boost morale and strive for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various tasks next year.

The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee issued a notice saying that conscientiously studying and implementing the resolutions and spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is of decisive significance for improving the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level of the entire party, promoting the socialist and communist consciousness of the entire people, further consolidating the people's communes, and realizing a greater leap forward in the national economy next year. The notice requires that the content of this meeting be conveyed within the Party first, and that study and discussion of the meeting documents be widely organized among the cadres and masses in communes, factories, organs, and schools, unfolding airing views and debates, and making several reports separately in the process of learning, linking them with the current practical work, and effectively solving the ideological problems that exist.

The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee pointed out in a notice issued to party committees at all levels that resolutely implementing and executing the Party's Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" is a major political task for the entire province at present. All organs, factories, mines, troops, and schools in the province should immediately arrange time for study. In rural areas (including border areas), study should be organized in various forms in conjunction with production and community rectification work. Through study, the vast number of cadres and the masses should gain a correct understanding of the issues such as the interconnectedness and differences between the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and the transition from socialism to communism, as well as the guidelines and policies formulated in accordance with the current nature and tasks of the commune, and understand how to correctly implement the Party's mass line in work methods and styles. Through study, cadres and the masses should clarify their thinking, unify their understanding, clarify their direction, continue to boost their energy, lay an ideological foundation for the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes, and strive for a greater leap forward in production next year.

When heroes and cadres on the agricultural front in Hunan Province gathered in Changsha to celebrate victory and strive for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year, the communique and relevant resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were published, which brought great encouragement and strength to everyone. The representatives who attended the conference enthusiastically discussed these documents. (Attached picture)
