Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 18th. The cofferdam of the Zhexi Hydropower Station in Hunan Province, one of the country's large-scale power stations, was closed on the 16th. After this, the project entered a new stage of excavating the dam foundation and pouring the dam.

The Zhexi Hydropower Station is located in the Darongtang area of Anhua County in the middle reaches of the Zi River, one of Hunan's "Four Great Waters", and is the largest power project in Hunan Province. Its main projects include a dam 100 meters high, 300 meters long, and 90 meters wide at the bottom, as well as huge diversion tunnels. Since the project started construction in July this year, it has progressed rapidly. More than 20,000 builders overcame difficulties such as inconvenient transportation on the construction site and insufficient machinery, equipment, and materials, built roads and a large number of workshops, completed more than 260,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work, and mined more than 120,000 cubic meters of sand and stone. Since December 14th, the workers, using a combination of indigenous and foreign production methods, completed the construction of three openings in the downstream cofferdam and one opening in the upstream cofferdam in just two days and two nights, in a river flow velocity of 3.8 to 5.55 meters per second.

At the time of the closure, the负责人 responsible persons of the Industry Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hydropower Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, as well as Soviet construction experts, went to congratulate them.

    资江中游一座大型电站
    柘溪水电站截流围堰合龙
    新华社长沙18日电  全国大型电站之一——湖南省柘溪水电站截流围堰于16日合龙。在这以后工程进入了开挖大坝基坑和浇筑拦河大坝的新阶段。
    柘溪水电站位于湖南“四大水”之一——资江中游安化县大溶塘地区，是湖南省内规模最大的电力工程。它的主要工程包括高一百公尺、长三百公尺、底宽九十公尺的拦河大坝和巨大的导流洞等。这项工程自今年7月开工兴建以后，进展迅速。两万多建设者克服了工地交通运输不便，机器设备和材料不足等困难，修筑了公路和大批工房，完成了土石方工程二十六万多方，开采了砂石十二万多方。自12月14日起，职工们采用土法生产和洋法生产结合的办法，仅用了两天两夜的时间，就在三点八至五点五五秒公尺的河水流速中，完成了下游围堰三个龙口和上游围堰一个龙口的工程。
    在合龙的时候，中共湖南省委工业部和水利电力部水电建设总局的负责人，苏联施工专家等都前往祝贺。
