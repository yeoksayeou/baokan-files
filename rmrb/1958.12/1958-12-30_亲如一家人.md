	"Footprint"
	Liu Qi, a cadre from the Central Ensemble who was sent to work in Zunhua County, returned from the fields. As soon as he entered the door, Aunt Huang glanced at his half-open shoes and said, "Did you work barefoot again today?" Before Liu Qi could answer, Aunt Huang took out a pair of brand-new cloth shoes from her box and handed them to him. Liu Qi tried to decline, but couldn't, so he took the shoes and tried them on. The size was just right.
	A month ago, Aunt Huang had been making a fuss about making shoes for Liu Qi, asking Liu Qi to take off his shoes so she could measure his size, but Liu Qi firmly refused. He felt that Aunt Huang was busy enough with both working in the fields and doing housework, and he shouldn't add to her troubles. He always put his shoes away at night before going to bed. Now, looking at the beautiful and comfortable shoes on his feet, Liu Qi was very puzzled. Finally, Aunt Huang revealed the secret to him. It turned out that Aunt Huang had tried various ways to measure his foot size but couldn't manage it. One day, Aunt Huang went to work in the field and saw Liu Qi carrying water to irrigate the wheat barefoot. She secretly used a sorghum stalk to measure his footprint.
	Upon hearing this, Liu Qi couldn't say a word, only secretly wiping away tears of gratitude.

	You Must Not Forget Home
	Sister Yalin,
	It's been over a month since you left, but it feels like it's been several months.
	Sister, I had so much to say to you the day you left, but I was too sad to say anything. I wanted to cry, but I was afraid it would make you feel bad. When the car came to pick you up, I couldn't hold back anymore, and the tears just flowed out. Now I regret not talking to you more then.
	Everything is fine at home. Dad and Mom are as healthy as before. But the old folks miss you all the time, and haven't been sleeping well for several nights. I've also been restless these past few days, and can't concentrate on my studies. Once, in class, I called the teacher "Sister," and the classmates all laughed. I was so embarrassed that my face turned red.
	Dad and Mom repeatedly told you to write often. If you don't write, Mom will say you've forgotten home. Mom also said that seeing your letter is like seeing you in person. She told me to keep your letters, and when they miss you, they'll have me read them aloud. Hearing the letters being read is like hearing you speak.
	Sister, all the villagers say good things about you. Some villagers happily said, while holding their work point books, that you recorded them for them. Especially Zhu Yuhua, he didn't know you were leaving that day, and he was angry for several days.
	I received the book you sent. Dad bought a piece of cardboard from the cooperative and covered the book with it.
		Little Sister, Zongping
	Note: This is a letter from a young girl in Xiaguanying Village, Caodongzhuang Township, Funing County, Hebei Province, to Comrade He Yalin, a cadre from the People's Publishing House who was once sent to work there.
	"Bone-Setting Doctor"
	One morning, Sheng Jinzhang, a cadre sent to work in the countryside, was working in the fields when a farmer ran up to him, covered in sweat and gasping for breath, and said: "Come back quickly, Shi Fenglin fell off the mountain… broke his leg." Without saying a word, Sheng Jinzhang followed him back. He saw that the patient's injuries were too severe, and his own treatment skills were not very good. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to cure him, but when he thought about the fact that there wasn't a hospital nearby, looking at the patient's painful face, and remembering Shi Fenglin's hard work in carrying more than thirty bundles of firewood down from the snowy mountains, he didn't want to offer excuses. He was determined to cure the patient. Based on the condition being a dislocation, he rubbed and massaged it. The patient felt the pain gradually decreasing. For five or six consecutive days, Sheng Jinzhang went to treat the patient every day, often staying up late, especially in the evenings. Shi Fenglin's dislocated leg gradually improved, and soon he was back to work as usual.
	This "bone-setting doctor" admired by the villagers had not specifically studied this field of medicine. It was only that his mother was a bone-setting doctor, and he had learned a few tricks from her since he was a child. Although he felt that his skills were not at the level of a doctor, everyone said that he had a heart that cared for patients like a doctor. (Mo Ye)
	Celebrating a Birthday
	In the early morning, the sky was just beginning to turn white, and I was sleeping soundly when I suddenly felt someone gently push me. I sat up abruptly, thinking that I had overslept. But standing in front of me was the old grandma of the house I was staying in. The old woman was holding a bowl of steaming boiled eggs, and said with a smile:
	"There's sugar in the eggs, eat them while they're hot." What was going on? I wasn't sick!
	The old woman urged, "Get up quickly, everyone in our family, big and small, eats eggs on their birthday."
	What, is today my birthday? Is it the first day of the sixth lunar month? I was still a little confused.
	"Today is the first day of the sixth lunar month, we've prepared to celebrate your birthday a long time ago, and there's noodles too!"
	Then I realized that today was my birthday. It turned out that's what it was all about: It was not long after I was sent to the countryside. One day, the old woman was chatting with us and asked me how old I was and when my birthday was. I told the old woman everything, but it had been several months since then, and I had long forgotten about celebrating my birthday.
	I declined, saying that wasn't necessary, the eggs should be left for the baby to eat, but the old woman wouldn't agree, so I had to eat them.
	When I got to the fields, I still hadn't figured out how to thank the old woman, I only knew to work hard on the waterwheel, so that the crops would grow strong….

    亲如一家人
    “脚印”
    中央乐团下放在遵化县的干部刘奇从田间回来，一进门，黄大嫂看了一眼他脚上半张口的鞋，便说：“今天又打着光脚丫儿干活了吗？”没等刘奇回话，黄大嫂从箱子里取出一双崭新的布鞋，递给他。刘奇推辞不过，接过鞋子穿上试了试，大小刚合适。
    一个月以前，黄大嫂就嚷嚷吵吵要给刘奇做鞋，叫刘奇把鞋子脱下给他量量尺寸，刘奇坚决不干。他觉得大嫂又要下地，又要做家务事，也够忙了，不该再给她添麻烦。晚上睡觉他总是把鞋子收起来。这时看着脚上又漂亮、又舒服的鞋子，刘奇非常纳闷。终于黄大嫂给他破了迷。原来黄大嫂想了各种办法量脚的尺寸都没办到，一天，黄大嫂到地里干活，看见刘奇正在光着脚担水浇麦子，她偷偷地用一根高粱秆，把脚印量下来了。
    刘奇听到这里，一句话也讲不出，只是感激得偷偷地擦眼泪。

    你可不能忘了家
    亚林大姐
    你走后一个多月了，我们都觉得好像有几个月似的。
    大姐，你走的那天我有很多话想和你说，可是心里太难过，说不出来，想哭，又怕你难受。当汽车来接你们的时候，我再也忍不住了，眼泪直往出流。现在想起就后悔，那时没和你多讲几句话。
    咱家一切都好，爹和妈的身体和以前一样。只是老人家时时刻刻想念你，连续几晚没睡好觉。那几天我也心神不定，书也看不进去，有一次在课堂上管老师叫大姐，同学们都笑了，我不好意思的脸都红了。
    爹和妈再三嘱咐你要常来信，如果不写信，妈就要说你忘了家。妈还说看到你的信就像见到你一样。你的来信她叫我保存起来，想你的时候，就叫我给他们念，听了念信，就像听到你说话一样。
    大姐，咱村的老小都说你好，有的社员拿着记工分的本子，高兴地说是你给他们记的。特别是朱玉华，你走的那天他不知道，生了几天气。
    你寄来的书收到了，爹从合作社买了一张硬纸，把书皮包了起来。
      小妹  宗屏
    注：这是河北省抚宁县曹东庄乡下官营村的一位年轻姑娘，给曾经下放在那里的人民出版社干部贺亚林同志的一封信。
    “正骨大夫”
    早晨，下放干部盛进章正在田间干活，忽然迎面跑来了一位农民，满头大汗，气吁喘喘地说：“快回去，石凤林从山上摔下来了……跌断了腿。”盛进章二话没说，跟着就往回赶。一看病人伤势太重，自己治疗技术不太高明，害怕治不好，但想想附近又没有医院，看到病人痛苦的脸，再想想石凤林从积雪的高山上背下三十多捆劈柴的苦干精神，便怎么也不愿说出推辞的话，他下决心一定要治好病人。根据病情是脱臼，他便一面搓、一面揉，病人觉得疼痛逐渐减轻。连续五、六天，盛进章天天去给病人治疗，尤其是晚上经常守到深夜。石凤林脱臼的腿渐渐好转，不久便照常干活了。
    这位被社员们敬仰的“正骨大夫”，并没有专门学过这门医学，只是他的母亲是正骨医生，他从小在母亲身边，慢慢学会几手。虽然他觉得自己的技术并不够一个医生的水平，但人人都说他有一颗像医生一样关心病人的心。    （莫也）
    过生日
    清晨，天空微微发白，我正睡得香甜，忽觉有人轻轻推了一下，我猛地坐了起来，心想这下可睡过火了。可是站在面前的是我住家的老奶奶。老人家端上一碗热腾腾的煮鸡蛋，笑嘻嘻地说：
  “蛋里面有糖，趁热吃吧。”这是怎么回事？我没生病啊！
    老奶奶催着说：“快起来吧，咱家大大小小的人过生日，都要吃鸡蛋的。”
    怎么，今天是我的生日？是六月初一吗？我还有些搞不清楚。
    “今天是六月初一，我们早就预备好给你过生日，还有面条呢！”
    这时我才明白，今天是我的生日。原来是这么一回事：那还是我下放不久，一天，老奶奶和我们聊天，问到我多大年纪，什么时候生日，我一一告诉了老奶奶，可是时间已过了几个月，我早就忘了过生日的事情。
    我推辞着，不要这样，鸡蛋留着给宝宝吃吧，老奶奶怎么也不肯，我只好把它吃了。
    到了田间，我还没想出怎样感谢老奶奶，只知道用力踏水车，让庄稼长得壮壮的……。
