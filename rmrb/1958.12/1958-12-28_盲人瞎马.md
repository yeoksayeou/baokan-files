    Blind Man and Blind Horse
    Ji Hewen
    "A blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pond in the middle of the night." This is an ancient Chinese fable used to describe the dangerous situation of someone who doesn't know the direction and doesn't understand the rules. Fables are often assumptions, mostly hypothetical, and rarely true; but this blind man and blind horse can now really be found, and these are some of the fools in the West.
    Their blindness is fundamentally in their inability to see "the objective law that the socialist system will ultimately replace capitalism, which is independent of people's will," and their attempt to "stop the advance of the wheels of history." Starting from this, their blind and foolish deeds emerge endlessly. For example, they are ignorant of themselves. They can't figure out why the capitalist economic system is deteriorating? Can't figure out how a noose got around their necks, can't figure out why the Western wind is so shrinking? Can't figure out why the reactionary groups are disintegrating day by day?... And only know to fly east and run west, busy "mending dikes", eager to beg God. It seems that even if there is "God" and "Heaven", a blind man riding a blind horse still has no way to find the way.
    They are also ignorant of others. Take China, for example, they have been groping for nearly ten years, but they still haven't figured out what the "giant elephant" looks like. One moment they say they have to admit it exists, the next moment they say it doesn't exist; one moment they say it is "not worth mentioning," the next moment they say it is "terrible." Clearly blind, they even blindly comment on our people's communes, families, labor and other issues. What can such a blind man who has never seen anything understand?
    Blind men and blind horses are no obstacle to people with bright eyes. But they do not listen to people's warnings, insisting on stopping the wheels of history from advancing, insisting on blundering blindly, and the result, apart from possibly knocking down two unreliable tofu stalls in the struggle, isn't it just that the blind man himself falls into the "deep pond" that counts?

    盲人瞎马   
    纪和观
    “盲人骑瞎马，夜半临深池”。这是中国的一个古寓言，用以形容一个不知方向，不懂规律者所处的危险境地。寓言往往是假定，设想性的多，真有其事者少；但这盲人瞎马，现在却真能找到，这就是西方的一些蠢人们。
    他们的盲和瞎，最根本的就在于他们看不到“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义这个不以人们自己意志为转移的客观规律”，妄图“阻止历史车轮的前进”。由此出发，他的瞎干盲为的事情就层出不穷了。例如，他们对自己是无知的。他们弄不清资本主义经济制度为何每况愈下？弄不清脖子上怎会套上绞索，弄不清西风为何如此瑟缩？弄不清反动集团内又如此地在一天天分崩离析？……而只知道东飞西跑，忙于“打补锭”，急着求上帝。看起来纵有“上帝”和“天堂”，盲人又骑瞎马也是没法摸到去路的。
    他们对人家也是无知的。就说对中国吧，他们摸了近十年，就还不曾弄清“巨象”是个什么样儿。一会儿说不得不承认有，一会儿又说不存在；一会儿说“不足道”，一会儿又说“可怕了”。明白瞎着眼睛，他们居然也瞎议论起我们的人民公社，家庭，劳动等问题来。这种啥也没有看见过的盲人，他能懂得什么？
    盲人瞎马，对眼睛明亮的人们是没有什么妨碍的。而他们却不听人们的警告，硬要阻止历史车轮的前进，硬要瞎闯，结果除了在挣扎里可能撞倒两个不牢靠的豆腐摊而外，余下来还不是瞎子自己跌进“深池”才算数。
