Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th – Hongqi People's Commune in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, has earnestly implemented the policy of combining industry and agriculture, vigorously developing industry and promoting the great leap forward in agriculture.

This year, under the situation of a great leap forward in agricultural production, the demand for vehicles, fertilizers, water-lifting tools, and long-bladed steel shovels for deep plowing has greatly increased compared to the past. If these tools were only produced and supplied by local industrial and handicraft departments, it would not be possible to meet the demand. Under this new situation, the commune members generally felt that "a great leap forward in agriculture is empty talk without industry," and that it was necessary to vigorously develop industry to meet the needs of agricultural production development.

The Party Committee of Hongqi People's Commune analyzed this situation and decided to lead the masses in vigorously setting up various factories. Under the slogan of "Everyone a craftsman, making vehicles everywhere," they first set up vehicle manufacturing and repair factories, and quickly manufactured and repaired 9,000 large and small carts, ensuring the timely completion of fertilizer delivery tasks. Two machinery manufacturing and repair factories were established, successfully creating and modifying 29 kinds of machines and tools, producing a total of 4,157 pieces throughout the year to support agricultural production. Production teams all built fertilizer factories, trial-producing eight kinds of fast-acting fertilizers totaling 19.97 million dan, enabling 33,300 mu of crops to be fertilized at a rate of 600 dan per mu. Forty indigenous fertilizer factories were established to maintain year-round production, eliminating the need to purchase chemical fertilizers from outside. At the same time, a mass steelmaking campaign was launched throughout the commune, establishing two iron smelting plants, which produced more than 39,000 tons of pig iron. A portion of this iron was used to support national construction, while the commune used the rest to equip agriculture and transportation. They used indigenous iron to build an eight-li-long indigenous railway, which has begun transporting fertilizer, coal, and ore. Indigenous lathes were also made from indigenous iron, producing various indigenous machines for agriculture. With the rapid development of industry, the variety of new tools invested in agricultural production increased day by day. In this way, the labor efficiency of the commune members was greatly improved. Over the year, a total of more than 870,000 human and animal workdays were saved, and the phenomenon of labor shortage has been changed.

The result of the commune's vigorous development of industry over the past year has greatly promoted the development of agricultural production, achieving a double harvest in industry and agriculture. This year, the total grain output of the commune has increased several times compared to last year. The number of factories, large and small, has increased from 21 last year to 209, and the industrial output value has increased more than five times compared to last year.

At present, the commune's industry is gradually developing "from small to large, from indigenous to modern, from decentralized to industrialized" in a more standardized manner. The earthen furnaces in the iron plants have now been converted into earthen blast furnaces, and two new-style blast furnaces with a volume of 28 cubic meters have been established. New types of mountain product and fruit processing plants, fiber manufacturing plants, and gunpowder plants have also been established, turning previously worthless materials into new products through processing, increasing income by more than 930,000 yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 19th – The industry run by the Hongqi Commune in Heqing County, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, has experienced a leap in development over the past month. The output of industrial products has greatly increased, with more than 30,000 jin of wine produced in two days and nights, more than ten times higher than in the past. The types of products have also expanded, and all factories have begun to make profits, so the commune's income has greatly increased.

The Hongqi Commune is located in the mountains by the Jinsha River and is inhabited by more than 10,000 people of Bai, Yi, Miao, Lisu, Han, and other ethnic groups. The area is rich in orchards and timber forests, especially pears, peaches, pine nuts, acorns, and walnuts. Ramie and hemp are abundant. Animal husbandry is very developed, with many pigs, sheep, cattle, dairy cows, and bees. Medicinal materials are endless. The Yi and Miao people are good at excavating and processing medicinal materials. The Yi people are very good at beekeeping. The Bai and Han people are good at raising livestock. In the past, all ethnic groups had the custom of processing various light industrial products and food products.

Based on these conditions, the Hongqi People's Commune decided to build factories on a large scale, to turn pears and other fruits into wine, to press walnuts and pine nuts into oil, to make milk into rushan and rubing (Yunnan specialties), to cure pork into preserved meat, etc., and to comprehensively adjust the original more than 100 factories, establishing eleven factory groups according to their nature, such as metallurgy, winemaking, oil pressing, and cotton manufacturing, in order to provide classified leadership. The commune Party committee also appointed a deputy secretary to be specifically responsible for leading the industry, and established an industrial management committee to plan industrial production in a planned way. Labor was also arranged according to the characteristics of the ethnic groups, with Bai and Han commune members mainly engaged in metallurgical industry and dairy product processing, Miao and Yi commune members mainly responsible for medicinal material processing, and Lisu and Bai commune members mainly engaged in winemaking.

Some of the commune's leading cadres went to various types of industries to focus on one key point and summarize a set of experiences in mass movements. The Party branch strengthened political and ideological work, using various ethnic forms such as mountain songs and ditties to publicize the policy of combining industry and agriculture, making it known to every household. In the factories, tasks and indicators were determined from bottom to top through debates, and practical and feasible measures were proposed; on-site meetings were held in a timely manner to promote them, so the output increased rapidly. For example, after summarizing the experience of a winery, it guided 16 wineries, increasing the average daily wine output per person by tenfold.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th – Jianghuai People's Commune in Hefei City, Anhui Province, is vigorously developing industry, which not only meets its own needs, but also produces a large number of commodities, increasing income.

In a little over a month, the commune has already set up 33 factories in a simple and crude manner, including iron smelting, cement, agricultural tool manufacturing, starch, maltose, cotton weaving, flour, and vegetable processing, and expanded seven factories. Some of these factories are operated manually, while others have achieved semi-mechanization and mechanization. The establishment of these factories has made full use of various waste materials and raw materials. For example, sweet potato vines and corn stalks, which were originally used as firewood, are now used as raw materials for winemaking; coarse bran is not only used as feed, but also can be made into water glass and refined into furfural; straw is also used to make wine, refine alcohol, and make paper; sweet potatoes are made into starch, the starch residue is used to make wine, and starch can be made into vermicelli.

These factories can now produce more than 50 kinds of products. The rope traction machines and seeders manufactured by the commune's agricultural tool manufacturing plant played a great role in autumn plowing and sowing, increasing work efficiency by ten to forty times. More than 80% of the commune members can eat machine-made rice processed by their own factories and wear shoes produced by their own factories. Most of the cotton cloth, socks, gloves, wine, pickles, and other living materials needed by the commune members are supplied by the factories in the commune. The commune also produces a large number of commodities to meet market needs. In November, the commune had already supplied the city with a lot of starch, white wine, alcohol, maltose, straw ropes, and pickled vegetables, with an income of more than 43,000 yuan. These products are of good quality and are welcomed by the market. Hefei City Monopoly Company, City Xinshengtie Factory, City Huasabu Company and other departments have already signed long-term contracts with these commune-run factories and established production and sales relationships.

    向公社工业化迈进
    红旗等公社因地制宜就地取材大办工业
    新华社太原19日电  山西省晋城县红旗人民公社，认真贯彻了工农业并举的方针，大办工业，促进了农业的大跃进。
    今年在农业生产大跃进的形势下，红旗公社需要的车辆、化肥、提水工具和深翻地需要的长刃钢锹等，比以往大大增加。这些工具如果光靠地方工业、手工业部门生产供应，是不能满足的。在这种新的情况下，社员们普遍感到“农业大跃进，没有工业是空话”，必须大办工业，才能满足农业生产发展的需要。
    红旗人民公社党委会分析了这种情况，决定领导群众大力举办各种工厂，他们在“人人当工匠，大闹车子化”的口号下，首先办起了车辆制造和修理工厂，很快制造和修理了九千辆大车和小车，保证了送肥任务按时完成；建立了两个机械制造修配厂，创造和改制成功二十九种机械和工具，全年共生产了四千一百五十七件，支援了农业生产。生产队都建起了造肥厂，共试制成八种速效性肥料达一千九百九十七万担，使三万三千三百亩作物，亩施肥达六百担；兴办了四十个坚持长年生产的土化肥厂，从此再不用外出购买化肥了；同时全社展开了大炼钢铁的运动，建立了两个炼铁厂，炼出了三万九千多吨生铁，这些铁，除一部分支援了国家建设外，公社又用来武装了农业和交通运输业，他们用土铁修筑起八华里长的土铁路，已开始运送肥料、煤和矿石；又用土铁造出了土元车床，给农业上制出了各种土机械。随着工业的迅速发展，投入农业生产的各种新工具日益增多。这样，社员们的劳动效率大大提高。一年来，共节省人、畜工八十七万多个，劳力不足的现象已有改变。
    一年来，这个公社大办工业的结果，大大推动了农业生产的发展，获得了工业、农业双丰收。今年全社粮食总产量比去年成倍的增长。大小工厂由去年的二十一个增加到二百零九个，工业产值比去年提高了五倍多。
    目前，这个公社的工业，正逐步“由小到大、由土到洋、由分散到工厂化”进一步正规地发展着。现在，已经把铁厂的土方炉改成了土高炉，建立起了两座二十八立方公尺的洋高炉。新型的山货水果加工厂、纤维制造厂、火药厂也都建立起来，通过加工把过去不成钱的东西都制成了新产品，增加收入九十三万多元。
    新华社昆明19日电  云南大理白族自治州鹤庆县红旗公社办的工业，一个多月来有了飞跃的发展。工业品产量有很大提高，两昼夜出酒三万多斤，比过去提高了十多倍，产品种类也有扩大，所有工厂都开始有盈余，因此公社收入大大增长。
    红旗公社在金沙江边的大山上，居住有一万多白、彝、苗、傈僳、汉等族人民。这里果木林和用材林十分丰富，其中梨子、桃子、松子、橡子和核桃特别多。盛产苎麻、大麻。畜牧饲养业很发达，猪、羊、牛、奶牛和蜜蜂很多。药材无穷无尽。彝族、苗族人民善于挖掘和加工药材。彝族人民很会养蜂。白族汉族人民善于饲养家畜。各族人民过去都有加工各种轻工业品和食品的习惯。
    红旗人民公社根据这些情况，决定大建工厂，把梨子等水果酿成酒，核桃、松子榨成油，牛奶做成乳扇和乳饼（云南特产），猪肉腌成腊肉等，并把原有的一百多个工厂进行全面调整，按性质分类建立冶金、酿酒、榨油、造棉等十一个工厂小组，以便分类领导。公社党委又指定一个副书记具体负责领导工业，成立了工业管理委员会，有计划地安排工业生产。又根据民族的特长安排了劳动力，以白族、汉族社员为主进行冶金工业和乳制品的加工生产，苗族、彝族社员主要负责药材加工，以傈僳族、白族社员为主进行酿酒等。
    公社一部分领导干部分头深入各种类型的工业，抓住一个重点，总结一套群众运动的经验。党支部加强了政治思想工作，运用各种民族形式如山歌小调，来宣传工农业并举的方针，作到家喻户晓。在工厂里，从下而上地通过辩论确定任务指标，提出切实可行的措施；及时召开现场会加以推广，因此产量迅速提高。如总结了一个酿酒厂的经验以后，指导了十六个酒厂，使平均每人每日酒的产量提高了十倍。
    新华社合肥19日电  安徽合肥市江淮人民公社大办工业，既满足了自己的需要，又生产大量商品，增加了收入。
    在一个多月的时间内，这个公社已经因陋就简地办起了炼铁、水泥、农具制造、淀粉、饴糖、棉织、面粉、蔬菜加工等三十三个工厂，扩建了七个工厂。这些工厂，有的是手工操作，有的已经做到半机械化和机械化。这些工厂办起来后，使各种废物和原料得到了充分的利用。例如红薯茆、玉米棒，原来都当作柴烧，现在成了酿酒的原料；粗糠不仅用作饲料，而且可以制成泡花碱和提炼糠醛；稻草也已用来酿酒、提炼酒精和造纸；红薯制成淀粉，粉渣酿酒，淀粉又可以制成粉丝。
    这些工厂已能生产五十多种产品。社的农具制造厂制造的绳索牵引机、播种机，在秋耕秋种中起了很大的作用，使工效提高十倍到四十倍。全社80％以上的社员都可以吃到自己工厂加工的机制米，穿上自己工厂生产的鞋子。社员所需要的棉布、袜子、手套和酒、酱菜等生活资料，大部分都由本社工厂生产供应。公社还生产了大量商品，供应市场需要。在11月份内，公社就已经供应城市很多淀粉、白酒、酒精、饴糖、草绳和腌制的蔬菜等，收入达四万三千多元。这些产品质量好，受到市场的欢迎。合肥市专卖公司、市新生铁工厂、市花纱布公司等部门，已经同这些社办工厂订立了长期合同，建立了产销关系。
