    Explain the policies, clarify the purpose
    Xin Shenghuo Cooperative members earnestly take stock of assets

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Xin Shenghuo People's Commune in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, started with mobilizing the masses to clear warehouses and take stock, preparing conditions for a good distribution and final accounting for 1958.

    Recently, the commune's Party committee mobilized the masses to conduct a thorough investigation of the income of each brigade and team this year. In the first few days of the cleanup, hundreds of thousands of catties of grain were cleared out. Originally, it was calculated that the average income per person in the entire commune this year was only 49 yuan. After a few days of inventory, the average income per person rose to 79 yuan, which made the members even more motivated to produce. Combined with the warehouse inventory, the whole commune built two highways, restored more than 30 paper mills, and installed 67 hydraulic processing machines in a few days. The diversified business income that was started in three days reached more than 10,000 yuan. After the warehouse inventory is completed, the commune also plans to sort out the work points for this year, assess wage levels, and do a good job in this year's distribution.

    The experience of this commune proves that clearing warehouses and taking stock must adhere to the mass line. When the Xin Shenghuo People's Commune began to clear warehouses and take stock, it took the "accounting route," with the commune and team accountants asking the work recorders level by level. Doing so, very little was cleared out. Later, the masses were mobilized to clean up together, and a lot of things were cleared out. After a mass cleanup, the first brigade cleared out more than 100,000 catties of grain and more than 50,000 yuan. Now the average income per person in the team has increased by more than 20 yuan compared with last year.

    According to the experience of this cooperative, in mobilizing the masses to clear warehouses and take stock, the purpose and policies of clearing warehouses and taking stock must be explained clearly to the broad masses of cadres and people, explaining that the cleared-out things are for better distribution; explaining that the grain and money cleared and reported are not considered concealment or private division, which makes everyone feel at ease.

### 讲清政策  说明目的  新生活社社员认真盘点资财

    讲清政策  说明目的
    新生活社社员认真盘点资财
    本报讯  湖北省谷城县新生活人民公社从发动群众清仓盘点入手，为搞好1958年的分配决算准备条件。
    最近这个公社的党委会发动群众把各大队、小队今年的收入来一次彻底清查。清理的头几天内，就清出粮食数十万斤。原来计算全公社今年每人平均收入只四十九元。经过几天的盘点，每人平均收入就上升到七十九元，这就使社员生产劲头更大了。结合清仓盘点全社在几天内修起了两条公路，恢复造纸厂三十多处，安装了六十七个水力加工车。在三天中搞起来的多种经营收入达一万多元。清仓盘点结束后，这个公社还准备清理今年工分，评定工资级别，搞好今年分配。
    这个公社的经验证明：清仓盘点必须坚持群众路线。新生活人民公社开始清仓盘点的时候，走“会计路线”，由社、队会计到记工员逐级询问，这样做，清出的东西很少；后来发动群众大家来清理，就清出很多东西。第一大队经过群众性的清理，清出十多万斤粮食和五万多元钱。现在该队每人平均收入比去年增加二十多元。
    根据这个社的经验，在发动群众清仓盘点，要把清仓盘点的目的和政策向广大干部和群众讲清楚，说明清理出来的东西是为了更好地进行分配；说明清出和报出的粮食、款子不算隐瞒私分，这就使大家没有顾虑了。
