Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 8th: The Minister of Economy of the United Arab Republic, Keschny, stated in his opening speech at the opening session of the Asian-African Economic Conference today that the people of Asian and African countries urgently need unity and cooperation to utilize their enormous wealth and potential. He said that Asian-African economic cooperation is the primary way to realize their common interests.

Keschny pointed out that Asian and African countries possess extremely rich agricultural, mineral, livestock, and water resources, but despite this, most people suffer from very low living standards. He said that the Asian-African Economic Conference will strive to prove to the world that the people of Asian and African countries are capable of handling their own affairs, raising the living standards of their people, and creating a bright and prosperous future for them.

Keschny said that the economic organizations of Asian and African countries sincerely hope to help each other and cooperate closely on the basis of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, and respect for national sovereignty. He finally expressed his belief that this conference, filled with brotherhood and mutual understanding, will surely produce great and brilliant results.

The Chairman of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce, Mohammed Rushdi, stated in his speech at the opening session that the convening of this conference is to realize the desire of the people of Asian and African countries to develop economic cooperation between them. He said that the Arab chambers of commerce firmly advocate comprehensive economic cooperation between Arab, Asian, and African countries. He added that this conference provides an opportunity to study the possibilities of conducting such cooperation for common benefit.

Rushdi expressed hope that the conference will discuss the pre-prepared documents on the various items on the agenda and make correct suggestions and resolutions for the common economic interests of Asian and African countries.

The conference unanimously elected the chief representative of the United Arab Republic and chairman of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce, Mohammed Rushdi, as the chairman of the conference.

The conference established five subcommittees to be responsible for discussing the five agenda items. These five agenda items, adopted at the preparatory committee meeting held in August of this year, are: (1) Studying ways to promote economic cooperation between Asian and African countries; (2) Studying the European Common Market and its impact on Asian and African countries; (3) Studying the difficulties in transfer of funds in Asian and African countries and solutions; (4) Establishing a central organization to coordinate economic cooperation; (5) Studying the methods and approaches for submitting recommendations on organizing economic cooperation to the governments of various countries.

The conference subsequently announced a recess. The subcommittees will meet from the 9th to the 11th before the closing session.
