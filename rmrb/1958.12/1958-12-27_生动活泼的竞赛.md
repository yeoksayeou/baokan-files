    Lively and Vigorous Competition
    Liu Shan
    The competition between the Gu Xian Steel Plant and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in Shanxi Province has become a celebrated story. This is not only because the two units have continuously set new production records in the competition, and many commendable and praiseworthy examples have emerged, but also because the competition between these two units has adopted a new, lively, and vigorous competition method, providing valuable experience for organizing competitions in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the competition experience of these two factories and let it blossom and bear fruit in various places.
    Labor competition is an important method for mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses and carrying out socialist construction, and it is a driving force for improving labor productivity and production. This has been repeatedly proven by past facts. The problem lies in how to organize the competition and what form to take. Since the Great Leap Forward, all work has been advancing by leaps and bounds, which has not only changed some unreasonable old methods and old systems in the past, but also created some new methods and new systems. As far as organizing socialist competition is concerned, the people have also created a variety of lively and vigorous new forms in the Great Leap Forward. For example, red flag competitions, on-site challenges, large-scale group competitions, etc. The competition between Gu Steel and Tai Steel is also a new type of competition form, which we call "soldier to soldier, general to general" single-line competition. The common feature of all these competition forms is that they were created by the people in the Great Leap Forward, so they are most suitable for the situation of the Great Leap Forward and most conducive to mobilizing the masses and launching mass movements. In a word, the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production has enriched the content and form of socialist competition, and the colorful socialist competition has greatly promoted the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    No matter what form of competition, there must be two (or more) parties in the competition, that is, there must be opposing sides. If the opposing sides are chosen well, the competition can be carried out better. The reason why the competition between Gu Steel and Tai Steel is so enthusiastic is because of the strong opposition. Gu Steel is a small factory, but it proposed to compete with Tai Steel, a large factory more than ten times its size. Small versus large is one of the main characteristics of this competition. Such a competition is a great promotion for both sides. Gu Steel proposed to compete with Tai Steel, and at the beginning, it implemented the policy of "small local groups" and mobilized the masses, exceeding Tai Steel in daily steel production, which was a great promotion for all the employees of Tai Steel, and the old idea of "Shanxi Steel King" was broken. The situation is pressing, and if you don't advance, you will retreat, so a movement to learn from Gu Steel and catch up with Gu Steel was launched, and new records in steel production were created in a very short time. For Gu Steel, they boldly proposed to compete with Tai Steel, which was also a great promotion for themselves. All employees understand that once they get on the horse, they can't get off, and if they want to compete, they must compete for fame, so they become more and more enthusiastic. From here, we can see that small factories challenging large factories can not only promote greater leaps forward in large enterprises, but also implement large-scale integration with small enterprises in the competition process, so that small enterprises can achieve greater leaps forward with the help of large enterprises. Combining small promotion and large promotion, the competition will be carried out better. The competition between Gu Steel and Tai Steel illustrates this problem with vivid facts.
    To make the competition truly become a driving force for promoting production, it is necessary to combine launching the competition with launching mass movements, and push the mass movement to a higher climax through the competition. The experience of the competition between Gu Steel and Tai Steel proves that organizing competition between factories of the same type is indeed a driving force for mobilizing the masses. This is because the competition indicators of both sides are very specific. At the beginning, it was steel production, and then it was steel rolling and blast furnace utilization coefficient. If one party wants to surpass the other party, it must launch a mass movement. And the small factory comparing indicators with the large factory is a good topic to mobilize the masses. If the small factory surpasses the large factory, the thinking of the employees of the small factory will be more liberated and their enthusiasm will be more full. If the large factory is overwhelmed by the small factory, the employees of the large factory will inevitably strive to catch up. Therefore, in the entire competition process, each stage of the competition is closely combined with the organization of new production upsurges. Each new competition topic is a new production upsurge. In order to surpass Tai Steel, Gu Steel organized five large-scale mass movements and created five new steel production records; similarly, in order to defeat Gu Steel, Tai Steel also organized three large-scale mass movements and created three new steel production records. And each mass movement upsurge has greatly promoted the improvement of leadership and management work within the enterprise. From the competition itself, it plays the role of promoting the internal from the outside; after the competition is launched, the masses will rise up to promote the leaders. In this way, the result of external promotion and internal promotion, mass promotion of leadership, will greatly mobilize the positive factors in all aspects, break through some backward links, and thus combine the large-scale mass movement with the improvement of leadership and management, so that the policy of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" will be more deeply implemented in all aspects.
    The competition between Gu Steel and Tai Steel fully embodies the characteristics of socialist competition and demonstrates the creativity of the broad masses of workers. In the competition, the revolutionary heroism of the working masses has been greatly developed, encouraging them to go all out and strive for the top; at the same time, the communist spirit of mutual learning and mutual assistance among the working masses has also been greatly developed. Gu Steel created the experience of launching a large-scale mass movement, and Tai Steel immediately sent a delegation to learn from it. Gu Steel established a permanent team in Tai Steel to learn from Tai Steel's advanced technology and experience. Both sides actively and enthusiastically passed on their advanced experience to each other, and both sides were happy and congratulated each other for creating new records and surpassing themselves. Because they clearly understand that the victory of the other side will surely further stimulate the enthusiasm of the employees of this factory and promote a greater leap forward in this factory. The facts are exactly like this. The result of the competition between the two sides is: wave after wave, both sides rise together. The competition has further strengthened the connection between the two factories and further enhanced the friendship between the employees of the two factories. This is also the goal we want to achieve by carrying out socialist competition.
    At present, the competition between Gu Steel and Tai Steel is still continuing, and the content of the competition has shifted from comparing output to comparing quality, and the scope of the competition has developed from inter-factory competition to mutual competition between workshops of the same type in the two factories. We wish both sides greater success in the competition.

    生动活泼的竞赛 
    刘山
    在山西省，故县钢铁厂与太原钢铁公司之间的竞赛，已传为美谈。这不仅是因为两个单位在竞赛中，接连不断地创造生产新纪录，出现了好多可歌可颂的事例，而且是由于这两个单位的竞赛，采用了一种新的生动活泼的竞赛方法，为今后组织竞赛提供了可贵的经验。因此，总结一下这两个厂的竞赛经验，并使之在各地开花结果，很为必要。
    劳动竞赛，是发动工人群众的积极性创造性、进行社会主义建设的重要方法，是提高劳动生产率、改进生产的动力。这已为以往的事实所一再证明。问题在于如何组织竞赛，采取什么形式组织竞赛。大跃进以来，各项工作都在突飞猛进，它既改变了过去一些不合理的旧方法、旧制度，也创造了一些新方法、新制度。就组织社会主义竞赛来说，人民群众在大跃进中，也创造了多种多样生动活泼的新形式。譬如红旗竞赛、现场打擂比武、大兵团竞赛等等。故钢与太钢之间的竞赛，也是一种新型的竞赛形式，我们把它称之为“兵对兵、将对将”的单线竞赛。所有这些竞赛形式，其共同特点都是人民群众在大跃进中创造的，因而也最适应大跃进形势，最有利于发动群众、大搞群众运动。一句话，工农业生产的大跃进，丰富了社会主义竞赛的内容与形式，丰富多彩的社会主义竞赛，又大大推动了工农业生产的大跃进。
    不管什么形式的竞赛，总要有竞赛的双方（或多方），也就是说要有对立面。对立面选择得好，竞赛便可以进行得更好。故钢与太钢的竞赛，所以进行得如此热烈，就是因为对立性强。故钢是个小厂，而却提出了和比它大十几倍的大厂——太钢竞赛，小对大，是这场竞赛的主要特点之一。这样的竞赛，对双方都是很大的促进。故钢提出与太钢竞赛，并且一开始由于贯彻了“小土群”的方针，发动了群众，在钢的日产量上超过了太钢，这对太钢全体职工是一个很大的促进，“山西钢王”的老大思想被破除了。形势逼人，不进则退，于是掀起了一个学故钢、赶故钢的运动，在很短时间内就创造了钢铁生产的新纪录。对故钢来说，他们大胆地提出了和太钢竞赛，对自己也是一个大促进。全体职工了解，上了马就不能下马，要竞赛就要赛出个名堂来，因而使他们越赛劲越大。从这里，我们可以看到，小厂向大厂挑战，不仅可以促进大企业的更大跃进，而且也可以在竞赛过程中，实行以大带小，在大企业的帮助下，使小企业得到更大的跃进。小促大和大带小结合起来，竞赛便会进行得更好。故钢与太钢的竞赛，以生动的事实说明了这个问题。
    要使竞赛真正成为推动生产的动力，就要把发动竞赛和大搞群众运动结合起来，通过竞赛把群众运动推向更高潮。故钢与太钢竞赛的经验证明，组织同类型的厂与厂之间的竞赛，确实是发动群众的动力。这是因为双方的竞赛指标非常具体，一开始是钢产量，而后是轧钢、高炉利用系数。一方要想超过一方，就必须大搞群众运动。而小厂与大厂比指标，本身就是个发动群众的好课题。小厂超过了大厂，小厂职工思想就更加解放，干劲更饱满，大厂被小厂压倒，大厂职工必然要奋力赶上。因此，在整个竞赛过程中，每一阶段的竞赛，都是和组织新的生产高潮紧密相结合的。每一次新的竞赛课题，都是一次新的生产高潮。故钢为了超过太钢，曾组织了五次大规模的群众运动，创造五次钢产量新纪录；同样，太钢为了胜过故钢，也组织三次大规模的群众运动，创造了三次钢产量新纪录。而每一次群众运动高潮，又都大大促进了企业内部的领导工作与管理工作的改进。从竞赛本身来说，是起了以外促内的作用的；竞赛掀起之后，群众就要起来促领导。这样，外部促内部，群众促领导的结果，便大大调动起各方面的积极因素，突破一些落后环节，从而把大搞群众运动和改进领导、改进管理结合起来，使“两参一改三结合”的方针，更深入地贯彻到各方面去。
    故钢与太钢的竞赛，充分地体现了社会主义竞赛的特点，显示广大职工群众创造性。在竞赛中，职工群众革命的英雄主义得到了极大的发扬，鼓足干劲，力争上游；同时，职工群众的互相学习互相帮助的共产主义协作精神，也得到了极大的发扬。故钢创造了大搞群众运动的经验，太钢就马上派代表团去学习，故钢为了学习太钢的先进技术经验，在太钢设立了常驻小组。双方都主动热情地把自己的先进经验传授给对方，双方都为对方创造了新纪录超过了自己而高兴，而祝贺。因为他们清楚地了解，对方的胜利，必将更激发本厂的职工的干劲，促进本厂更大跃进。事实正是如此。双方竞赛的结果是：一浪高一浪，双方齐高涨。竞赛进一步密切了两厂的联系，更加增强了两厂职工间的友谊。这也正是我们开展社会主义竞赛，所要达到的目的。
    目前，故钢与太钢间的竞赛还在继续进行，竞赛的内容已由比产量转向比质量，竞赛的范围也由厂际竞赛而发展到两厂同工种车间的相互竞赛。我们预祝双方在竞赛中创造更大的成绩。
