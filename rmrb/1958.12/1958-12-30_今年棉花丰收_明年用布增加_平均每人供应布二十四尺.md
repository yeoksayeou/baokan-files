Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The validity period for 1958 cloth ration coupons will expire at the end of this month, and they will no longer be valid after the deadline. Recently, the State Council approved the Ministry of Commerce's "Report on the Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth in 1959" and has forwarded it to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government for implementation. The report states that the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, along with the unprecedented bumper cotton harvest this year, has provided favorable conditions for increasing the production of yarn and cloth. After national reserves, supplies of wadding cotton, and increases in the necessary turnover stock of both cotton and wadding cotton, and exports, approximately 11 million bales of yarn can be spun next year based on the spinning capacity that can be achieved. Based on this yarn output, after deducting yarn for other uses, about 8 million bales will be used for weaving, producing approximately 9.6 billion meters of cloth, an increase of about 50% compared to 1958. The increase is considerable. However, on the demand side, as cloth production increases, the supply of cloth can be increased by a certain amount. At the same time, due to the great development of industrial and agricultural production and the nationwide communization, the cloth used for production and various public needs has also increased. Therefore, in the allocation of cloth, it is necessary to weigh the priorities and take overall consideration. It has been determined that, in addition to making appropriate arrangements for national reserves, military needs, exports, production and other uses of cloth, and inventory reserves, the plan is to increase the per capita consumption of cloth by six feet, reaching a national average of twenty-four feet per person, based on the 1958 average of eighteen feet per person. It is appropriate to arrange the planned supply of civilian cloth in 1959 in this way in order to increase the necessary national reserves and take into account the use of cloth for production and other items.

Because the conditions in various regions of our country are different, the principles to be followed in the planned distribution of civilian cloth next year are: (1) Cold regions should still have a higher allocation than warmer regions; (2) Regions with historically low quotas should be appropriately increased; (3) Regions that previously produced a lot of homespun cloth but no longer produce it after communization should be taken care of; (4) Between urban and rural areas, except for a few large cities and concentrated industrial and mining areas which may be slightly higher, the quotas should be leveled out by region. According to the above principles, the allocation of civilian cloth quotas for various regions in 1959 will see smaller increases for Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and the northeastern region, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, which originally had higher quotas. The remaining regions will generally increase by five or six feet or more, with individual increases of seven feet or more. The specific allocation of quotas between different regions within each province, municipality, and autonomous region shall be determined by the respective provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in accordance with the above spirit.

The 1959 cloth ration coupons will still be divided into two periods: the first period, from January to June, averages ten feet per person and can be used until the end of the year; the second period, from July to December, averages fourteen feet per person and cannot be used in advance.

The growth comparison between cotton cloth resources and needs in 1959 is still not ample. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to strictly implement the policy of planned supply and the spirit of saving cloth, and to continue to develop the production of wild fiber fabrics and recycled waste fibers, striving to increase some substitutes.

### 今年棉花丰收  明年用布增加  平均每人供应布二十四尺

    今年棉花丰收  明年用布增加
    平均每人供应布二十四尺
    新华社29日讯  1958年布票的使用期限到本月底即将截止，过期停止使用。最近国务院已经批准了商业部“关于1959年棉布计划供应问题的报告”，并已转发各省、自治区、直辖市布置执行。报告中说，全国工农业生产大跃进，今年棉花获得空前的大丰收，为增加纱布生产提供了有利条件，除了国家储备、供应絮棉和增加必要的纺棉和絮棉的周转库存及出口以外，按可能达到的纺纱能力，明年可以纺纱一千一百万件左右。按照这个产纱量，除去其它各项用纱外，用于织布的有八百万件左右，产布九十六亿公尺左右，较1958年提高50％左右，增加的幅度是不小的。但在需要方面，由于布匹的生产增加了，布匹供应可以增加一定的数量；同时，又由于工农业生产的大发展，全国的人民公社化，生产用布和各种公共需用布亦有所增加；因此，在布匹分配方面，必须权衡轻重，通盘照顾。经确定，除对国家储备、军需、出口以及生产和其它用布和库存力量作适当安排外，对个人消费用布，拟在1958年平均每人十八尺的基础上，增加六尺，达到全国平均每人二十四尺。为了增加国家必要的储备和兼顾生产用布和其他各项用布，这样来安排1959年民用布的定量供应是适当的。
    由于我国各地区的条件不同，因此明年的民用布定量分配，应该掌握的原则是：（一）寒冷地区仍应较温暖地区高些；（二）过去定量低的地区应该适当多增；（三）过去生产土布较多，公社化以后不再生产土布的地区应该加以照顾；（四）城乡之间，除少数大城市及集中工矿区可略高外，应该分区拉平。按照以上原则安排的1959年各地民用布定量，对北京、天津、上海及原来定量较高的东北地区、内蒙古、新疆和青海等省、市、自治区增加较少，其余地区一般增加在五尺、六尺以上，个别增加七尺以上。至于各省、市、自治区内不同地区间的定量安排，由各省、市、自治区根据上述精神自行掌握确定。
    1959年的布票仍分前后两期，前期1至6月平均每人十尺，可以通用到年底；后期7至12月平均每人十四尺，不能提前使用。
    1959年棉布资源和需要的增长对比，仍然是不够宽裕的，因而必须继续严格贯彻计划供应政策和节约用布的精神，继续发展野生纤维织物和废旧纤维再制的生产，力求增加一些代用品。
