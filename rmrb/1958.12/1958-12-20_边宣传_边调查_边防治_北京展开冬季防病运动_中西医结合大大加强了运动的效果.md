Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: A mass movement centered on hygiene and the prevention of winter infectious diseases has been widely launched in various districts of Beijing.

Since late November, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has begun to deploy this work. Many district party secretaries personally took charge, organizing medical and health personnel and related personnel to go to factories, rural areas, and neighborhoods to educate the masses on winter hygiene and disease prevention. Relevant departments printed and distributed more than 600,000 copies of publicity materials on the prevention of diseases such as measles and influenza. Through the concentrated publicity in early December, many places have achieved widespread awareness in every household.

All districts have implemented the method of simultaneously publicizing, investigating, and strengthening prevention and control measures, actively organizing the masses to prevent the transmission and spread of epidemics. Chongwen, Xuanwu, and other districts, in conjunction with publicity, conducted investigations on children in the entire district who are susceptible to measles and administered placenta globulin, umbilical cord powder, purple gromwell root water (traditional Chinese medicine), and other drugs for prevention based on their physical fitness. Changping, Fengtai, and other districts, while carrying out disease prevention publicity, rectified the mass epidemic reporting network. The health workers of the Pi Mao San Factory installed wind hoods in all 70-plus rooms of the factory to ensure air circulation and prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. The cooks of the Third Construction Engineering Company brought chopped and seasoned coriander, ginger, pepper powder, etc., every time they delivered meals. Workers could make a fragrant, palatable, and cold-preventing hot soup by simply pouring boiling water over these ingredients.

Major hospitals throughout the city have dispatched medical teams to factories, mines, and rural areas to assist in carrying out disease prevention and control work. On the basis of graded and specialized medical care, urban districts have implemented a district doctor responsibility system, with medical personnel assigned to specific sections to comprehensively understand the local disease situation and treatment, and to be responsible for publicity, home visits, and other work. Under the guidance of district doctors, each district established district isolation rooms or isolation beds for the care and treatment of sick children. Doctors from many joint clinics and private practitioners also actively participated in district prevention and control work.

The implementation of the policy of integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicine has greatly enhanced the effectiveness of this movement. Shunyi, Tongzhou, Fengtai, and other districts have held forums for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to study and summarize the experience of traditional Chinese medicine in treating measles. Many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Fengtai District proposed more than 380 various effective prescriptions and single remedies in two days. Medical personnel in Mentougou, Chongwen, and other districts used their ingenuity to make a large amount of placenta powder and umbilical cord powder under simple conditions, ensuring the smooth progress of disease prevention work. Disease prevention methods circulating among the masses have also emerged in large numbers during the movement.

    北京展开冬季防病运动
    中西医结合大大加强了运动的效果
    新华社19日讯  一个以讲卫生、防治冬季传染病为中心的群众运动，已经在北京市各区普遍开展起来。
    中共北京市委从11月下旬起，就着手布置这一工作。很多区委书记亲自挂帅，组织医务卫生及有关人员下厂、下乡、下地段，向群众进行冬季讲卫生、防疾病的教育。有关部门印发了预防麻疹、流行性感冒等疾病的宣传材料六十多万份。通过12月上旬的突击宣传，有不少地方已经作到了家喻户晓。
    各区都实行了边宣传、边调查、边加强防治措施的方法，从积极方面组织群众防止流行病的传染和蔓延。崇文、宣武等区结合宣传，对全区容易感染麻疹的儿童进行了调查，并分别按体质的强弱给以胎盘球蛋白、脐带粉、紫草根水（中药）等药物，进行预防。昌平、丰台等区在开展防治疾病宣传的同时，整顿了群众疫情报告网。皮毛三厂保健员为全厂七十多间房屋安装了风斗，使空气流通，并预防煤气中毒。第三建筑工程公司炊事员每次送饭时，都带着切好和调好的香菜、生姜、胡椒粉等。工人们用开水把这些东西一冲，就可以喝到又香又适口又能预防感冒的热汤。
    全市各大医院都分别派出医疗队，深入厂矿、农村，协助开展疾病防治工作。城区各区在分级分工医疗的基础上，实行了地段医师负责制，医护人员分段包干，全面掌握本地段的疾情和治疗，并负责宣传、访视等工作。在地段医师指导下，各区建立了地段隔离室或隔离病床，护理和治疗病儿。许多联合诊所的医师和私人开业医师，也都积极地参加了地段防治工作。
    由于执行了中西医结合的方针，大大地加强了这个运动的效果。顺义、通州、丰台等区都召开中医座谈会，研究总结中医治疗麻疹的经验。丰台区许多中医在两天中就提出各种验方、单方三百八十多个。门头沟、崇文等区的医务人员开动脑筋，因陋就简，在没有设备或设备不足的情况下，制造了大量的胎盘粉、脐带粉，保证防病工作的顺利进行。群众中流传的防治疾病方法，在运动中也大量涌现出来。
