    Commune Children's Song
    Jin Jin
    Tap Water on the Mountain
    We connected bamboo on the mountain,
    Clear tap water flows out,
    Connected to the dining hall,
    For boiling water, cooking and washing vegetables,
    Connected to the bathhouse,
    Clear water flows day and night quickly.
    This water is better than in the city,
    River water is not as good as this.
    Sewing Group
    Mom just got paid,
    Bought cloth to make me a cotton jacket,
    Sent it to the sewing group,
    The machine jumps and bounces, it's done in two hours,
    No cost at all.
    In the future, wearing clothes won't cost money,
    That method is even better.
    Barbershop
    The commune has a barbershop,
    Everyone gets a haircut for free,
    Twice a month,
    Clean and good-looking,
    My hair is cut short,
    The look is even more brave.
    A fragrance comes from my head,
    Butterflies and bees follow me around.

    山上的自来水
    山上接下毛竹来，
    流出清清的自来水，
    通到食堂里，
    烧茶煮饭又洗菜，
    通到澡堂里，
    清水日夜流得快。
    这水要比城里好，
    河水哪有这样美。
    缝衣组
    妈妈工钱刚领到，
    买布给我做棉袄，
    送到缝衣组，
    机器突突跳，两个钟头就做好，
    一点费用也不要。
    将来穿衣不要钱，
    那个办法更加好。
    理发馆
    公社办个理发馆，
    大家理发不要钱，
    一月理两次，
    干净又好看，
    我的头发剪得短，
    样子看看更勇敢。
    头上发出一阵香，
    蝴蝶蜜蜂跟我转。
