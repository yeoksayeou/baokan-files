Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Since the Party Central Committee emphasized in 1954 the policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine and inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and after the health departments criticized the erroneous ideas of He Cheng and others who despised, discriminated against, and excluded traditional Chinese medicine, much progress has been made in the work of traditional Chinese medicine under the leadership of the Party. The initial implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine has led to the discovery and widespread application of many effective TCM techniques, and the treatment of many difficult and severe cases. The treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine has attracted widespread attention. The Party Central Committee pointed out that Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine and strengthening the unity of Chinese and Western medicine is the key to inheriting and developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Following this instruction from the Party, health departments successively opened full-time study classes for Western doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine in six major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Tianjin from 1955 to 1956, systematically studying TCM theory and treatment techniques for a period of two and a half years. More than 300 Western doctors participated in the study. They have successively appeared in medical and health institutions across the country and have begun to use both Chinese and Western medical techniques to serve the health of the people. Medical institutions in many regions have held short-term full-time study classes for Western doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine, and have organized Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine while on the job, enabling thousands of Western doctors to initially grasp some relevant TCM medical techniques. After Western doctors mastered TCM techniques, the quality of medical work has improved significantly. Diseases that were previously difficult or even intractable are now treated with good results using TCM methods or a combination of Chinese and Western methods. Zhou Rongqing, an ENT Western doctor at the Chengdu First People's Hospital, has used TCM methods after learning traditional Chinese medicine to restore sight to patients blinded by glaucoma and cataracts, and to restore hearing to patients with neurogenic deafness. Western doctors at the Beijing Medical College have cured many cases of acute appendicitis using TCM methods of taking decoctions without surgery. More importantly, Western doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine provides the necessary conditions for promoting and improving TCM academics with modern natural science and technology.

The rich TCM academics are the crystallization of the experience of the broad masses of Chinese people over thousands of years. They are not only mastered by TCM doctors, but also by the working people in other industries. Recently, many regions have launched mass "folk song collecting" movements to visit and seek out talented people and collect folk remedies and secret recipes. Under the appeal of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, people have come forward to offer their secret recipes and special skills to their governments. Among those who offered their treasures, there are veteran TCM doctors, Chinese medicine practitioners, as well as barbers, farmers, housewives, and other people from all walks of life. Hunan TCM doctors Wang Jinbang and Yang Longqing offered their special skills and secret recipes for treating esophageal cancer, which had been passed down for generations. Local medical units invited them to use this secret recipe to treat 50 patients, with an effectiveness rate of 80%. There is a snake venom treatment expert in Nantong, Jiangsu, named Ji Desheng. Before liberation, he was a beggar. His ancestral secret recipe for treating snake venom has been repeatedly tested and proven effective. Now he has dedicated his secret recipe to the government. The people of Jiangxi have offered a folk remedy for treating dysentery using Fengyancao and wild pumpkin, which has been clinically tested with an effectiveness rate of 90%.

In order to inherit the experience and techniques of elderly TCM doctors and prevent them from being lost, health departments in various regions have selected some Chinese and Western doctors with medical background and clinical experience to apprentice to famous veteran TCM doctors, and at the same time called on TCM doctors in various regions to train a large number of apprentices. There are now about 70,000 TCM apprentices studying with masters across the country. After three to five years of apprenticeship, they will be a strong TCM force on China's health front. Establishing TCM schools is also an important measure to train TCM successors and inherit TCM academics. In recent years, 13 TCM colleges and hundreds of TCM specialized schools have been established in various regions.

Much work has also been done to translate ancient TCM classics into modern vernacular and to edit TCM textbooks in vernacular, which greatly helps the younger generation who are not familiar with ancient Chinese to learn TCM. Health departments have also organized famous TCM doctors with writing skills to write books and theories so that their academic experience can be passed on to future generations and better serve mankind. Tang Yangchun, a famous TCM doctor in Chongqing in his 70s, compiled and published the "Brief Medical Formulas for Typhoid Fever and Warm Diseases" in two volumes and "Experience-Based Prescriptions" in three volumes before National Day this year.

The TCM Research Institute established in the capital and many TCM research institutions and Chinese and Western medical personnel in higher medical colleges are using modern science and technology to study and experiment with the efficacy of TCM. For example, TCM uses three fingers to feel the pulse to distinguish many different pulse conditions, which is used as a basis for diagnosing the disease. Some people think that this is a pretentious act without scientific basis. Now, the TCM research class in Tianjin has used pulse wave recorders to record in detail the different forms of pulses of various patients, proving that the three-finger pulse diagnosis of TCM has a scientific basis. Medical institutions in Beijing and Shanghai have created meridian measuring devices and found many "acupoints" on the twelve meridians, which can initially prove that the meridians on the human body are indeed objectively existing, and the TCM meridian theory is not metaphysics, but science.

In recent years, the strength of TCM has also been further developed. Health administrative departments have absorbed TCM doctors to participate in the work. Many Western medicine hospitals have hired TCM doctors to participate in medical work or established TCM departments. More than 300 TCM hospitals and a large number of TCM outpatient institutions have been established across the country. These institutions are also good places to inherit and carry forward TCM academics. TCM has played a great role in the prevention and treatment of diseases that seriously threaten people's health. For example, in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, from 1956 to the first half of 1958, according to incomplete statistics, TCM rescued more than 134,000 patients, most of whom were in the late stages of the disease who had lost their labor force or even were in critical condition.

In recent years, the social status of TCM has greatly improved, and many TCM doctors have been elected as representatives to the National People's Congress and local people's congresses, and as representatives to the CPPCC.

The production and supply of Chinese herbal medicine have also been continuously increasing and improving in recent years. In 1957, the total output value of Chinese herbal medicines increased by nearly 200 times compared with 1953; the variety has also increased. In order to further improve the production of Chinese herbal medicines, work is underway to transform wild medicinal plants and animals into domesticated species.

This series of measures to implement the TCM policy is deeply welcomed by the broad masses of the people. After Western medicine hospitals hired TCM doctors to participate in treatment and established TCM departments, patients have requested to be treated with TCM methods; TCM hospitals and TCM clinics are even more crowded. People like the effective, simple, non-major surgery, and suitable for Chinese physique and habits of TCM treatment methods. The increasing sales volume of Chinese herbal medicines year by year and the fact that they are still in short supply also show that the broad masses of the people trust TCM. This shows how correct the Party's TCM policy is and how it conforms to the interests of the broad masses of the people.

    党的中医政策的伟大胜利
    中医工作有重大改进中医宝库引起广泛重视
    新华社5日讯  自从1954年党中央强调了团结中西医，继承和发扬祖国医学遗产的中医政策，卫生部门批判了以贺诚为代表的轻视、歧视和排斥中医的错误思想之后，中医工作在党的领导下，做出了很多成绩。党的中医政策初步执行的结果，使许多疗效卓越的中医技术被发掘出来推广应用，使好些疑难重症得到了救治。中医宝库引起了人们广泛的重视。党中央指出，西医学习中医、加强中西医团结，是继承、发扬祖国医学遗产的关键。卫生部门遵照党的这个指示，在1955年到1956年间先后在北京、上海、武汉、成都、天津等六大城市开办了西医学习中医的脱产学习班，系统地学习中医理论和治疗技术，两年半为期，参加学习的西医共有三百多人。他们已经陆续出现在各地医疗卫生机关，开始用中西两套医疗技术为人民健康服务。许多地区的医疗机关举办了西医学习中医的短期脱产学习班以及组织西医在职学习中医，使数千名西医初步掌握了一些有关的中医医疗技术。西医掌握了中医技术以后，医疗工作质量有显著提高。过去感到困难的甚至束手无策的疾病，现在用中医疗法或中西两种疗法配合，收到很好的成效。成都市第一人民医院五官科西医周熔清学习了中医以后，已经用中医疗法使患青光眼、白内瘴致盲的病人重见了光明；使神经性耳聋患者恢复了听觉。北京医学院的西医用中医不开刀服汤药的方法治愈了许多例急性阑尾炎。更重要的是，西医学习了中医以后，对于用现代自然科学技术发扬和提高中医学术，提供了必要的条件。
    丰富的中医学术是中国广大人民千百年来经验的结晶，它们不仅掌握在中医师的手中，也掌握在其他各行各业的劳动人民手中。近来许多地区开展了访贤求贤和征集单方秘方的群众性的“采风”运动。在党的中医政策的感召下，人们纷纷向自己的政府献出了秘方和特技。献宝的人们中间，有老中医，有中药从业人员，也有理发师、农民、家庭妇女等各行各业的群众。湖南中医王金榜、杨隆卿献出了祖传几辈子的治食道癌的特技和秘方。当地医疗单位请他们用这个秘方治疗了五十名患者，疗效达80％。江苏南通有一个治蛇毒的专家，叫季德胜，在解放前，他是一个乞丐。他祖传的治蛇毒秘方屡试屡验。现在他已把他的秘方献给政府。江西人民献出了用凤眼草、野南瓜治痢疾的单方，经临床实验，疗效达到90％。
    为了继承老年中医的经验技术，不使失传，各地卫生部门挑选了一些有医学基础和临床经验的中西医师拜著名老中医为师，同时号召各地中医大量培养徒弟。现在全国约有七万名中医徒弟正在随师学习，三、五年满师以后，他们将是我国卫生战线上一支强大的中医队伍。开办中医学校，也是一项培养中医接班人、继承中医学术的重要措施。这几年中，各地已经举办了十三个中医学院和数以百计的中医专科学校。
    把古代的中医经典著作译成现代语体文以及用语体文编辑中医教材的工作，也做了很多，这对于不谙古文的青年一代学习中医有很大帮助。卫生部门又组织有写作能力的著名中医著书立说，让他们的学术经验传诸后世，更好地为人类服务。重庆市七十多岁的著名中医唐阳春在今年国庆节前编写和整理出版了“伤寒温病简要医诀”上下集和“经验良方”三册著作。
    设立在首都的中医研究院以及各地许多中医中药研究机构和高等医药院校的中西医务人员，正在用现代科学技术研究实验中医中药的疗效。例如中医用三个指头切脉可以分辨出许多种不同的脉象，以作为诊断病情的依据。有些人认为这是没有科学根据的故弄玄虚。现在天津市的中医研究班用脉搏描术器详细纪录了各种病人的不同形态的脉搏，证明中医的三个指头切脉是有科学根据的。北京、上海的医学机关创造出经络测定器，找出了十二条经络的许多“穴位”，可以初步证明人体上的经络确是客观存在，中医的经络学说不是玄学，而是科学。
    这几年中，中医力量也有进一步的发挥。卫生行政部门吸收了中医参加工作。许多西医医院聘请中医参加医疗工作或设立中医科目。全国设立了三百多所中医医院和大批中医门诊机构，这些机构同时也是继承和发扬中医学术的良好场所。在防治那些严重威胁人民健康的疾病方面，中医发挥了很大作用。例如在防治血吸虫病工作中，从1956年到1958年上半年，据不完全统计，中医抢救了十三万四千多个患者，这些病人大多是已经丧失劳动力甚至生命垂危的晚期病人。
    这几年来中医的社会地位有很大提高，许多中医被推选为全国和地方的人民代表和政协代表。
    中药的生产和供应这几年中也在不断增加和改进。1957年中药药材的总产值比1953年增长将近二百倍；品种也有增加。为了进一步提高中药药材生产，正在进行变野生药用动植物为家种家养的工作。
    这一系列贯彻中医政策的措施，深受广大人民欢迎。西医医院聘请中医参加治疗和设立中医科以后，病人们纷纷要求用中医方法治疗；在中医医院和中医门诊部里，更是门庭若市。人们都喜欢疗效卓著、方法简便、不动大手术、适合中国人体质和习惯的中医治疗方法。从中药销售量的逐年增加并且还是供不应求这个情况，也可看出广大人民是信任中医的。这说明党的中医政策是如何的正确，是如何的符合广大人民的利益。
