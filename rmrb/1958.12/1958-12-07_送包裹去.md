    Delivering Packages
    Late one evening, after 9 p.m., a burst of joyful laughter and the creaking of wheels suddenly erupted from inside the gates of the Jinan Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Then, flatbed carts, tricycles, and handcarts surged out, each vehicle piled high with packages of all sizes.
    What was happening?
    Those who recognized him identified the man pulling the flatbed cart as Section Chief Li Guangdu of the Business Section. It turned out that the Business Section's employees were using their spare time to deliver parcels to the iron and steel construction site.
    Since autumn began, families from all over Shandong Province had been sending cotton-padded clothes and quilts to the workers in Jinan City who were supporting steel production. On the package shelves of the Business Section, hundreds and thousands of packages were piled up like small mountains. Although the Post and Telecommunications Bureau repeatedly urged users to pick them up, the steelmaking task was so intense that the workers had no time to collect their packages. As the weather turned cold, the employees at the package counter felt uneasy, thinking about the people battling day and night by the steel furnaces who hadn't yet put on their cotton clothes. Everyone expressed their willingness to break with convention and deliver the packages to the iron and steel construction site, so that the steelworkers could stay warm and energetically make more steel.
    The closing time had long passed, but when everyone heard that more than four hundred parcels for steelworkers had arrived from Yuncheng, they completely forgot the day's fatigue and began a new battle.
    The northwest wind blew harder and harder, the branches emitted a sharp whistling sound, and the cold wind was bone-chilling. However, the people delivering the packages were steaming with heat and their underwear was soaked with sweat.
    The ironworkers were extremely happy to see the Post and Telecommunications Bureau employees personally delivering the packages to the construction site. One worker had just requested a day off to go to the post office to pick up a package, but unexpectedly, the package was delivered right into his hands. He said, very moved: "You are providing such thoughtful service; I will eat something and immediately return to the construction site to cancel my leave and seize the time to make more steel."

    送包裹去
    晚上九点多，济南邮电局的大门内，突然传出了一阵愉快的欢笑声和嘎吱嘎吱的车轮声。接着地排车、三轮车、手推车蜂拥而出，每辆车上都堆满了大小包裹。
    这是干什么去呢？
    认识的人，认出了拉地排车的是营业科的李光都科长。原来，这是营业科的职工，利用业余时间到钢铁工地去送邮包。
    入秋以后，山东各地来济南市支援钢铁生产的工人家里，不断地寄来棉衣棉被，营业科的包裹架上，成千成百的包裹堆得像小山一样，虽然邮电局一再催用户来取，但是，炼钢任务那样紧张，工人们那有时间来取包裹呢？天冷了，投包台的职工想到日夜战斗在炼钢炉旁的人们还没穿上棉衣，心里十分不安。大家纷纷表示要打破常规，把邮包送到钢铁工地去，让钢铁工人暖暖和和地大炼钢铁。
    下班时间早就过了，大家听到郓城又来了四百多件钢铁工人的包裹时，全忘记了一天的疲劳，开始了一个新的战斗。
    西北风越刮越大，树枝发出尖锐的啸声，寒风刺骨。但是，投送包裹的人们，头上热气腾腾，汗水湿透了内衣。
    炼铁工人看见邮电局的职工亲自把邮包送到工地来，高兴极了。有一个工人刚请好一天假，准备去邮局领取包裹，没想到邮包送到自己手上来了。他很感动地说：“你们服务得太周到了，我吃点饭马上就回工地销假，争取时间多炼钢”。  （王心镜  张振山）（附图片）
