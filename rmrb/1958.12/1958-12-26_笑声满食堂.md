    Laughter Fills the Canteen
    Chen Tao
    "Seven things are necessary to begin the day: firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea." These seven things can be summarized as simply "eating and drinking."
    For many years, people have busied themselves with these things, rushing about and expending immense effort, yet still unable to fill their bellies. The so-called "sages and wise rulers" of history, despite their talents for governing and their lofty ambitions, were helpless when it came to the people's food problem. They were fundamentally unable, and never even thought, to solve it. "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads, corpses of the frozen lie." This is a vivid portrayal of life in the old society.
    The true sage is the Communist Party. Now, the entire rural area has been collectivized, with public canteens being established everywhere, realizing "eating without paying." People no longer need to rack their brains over the seven necessities of daily life, as the public canteen has made excellent arrangements for everyone. Truly, "eat when the bell rings, and fear not being a large-bellied Arhat." No wonder people praise the public canteens so highly. One folk song says: "The public canteen is strong, with a variety of dishes. Eating without paying is truly unprecedented."
    Eating without paying, isn't this an unprecedented event? Let's see how another folk song describes it: "Establish the large canteen, thank the Communist Party. The dishes are varied, and everyone praises them. Eating well and full, laughter fills the canteen."
    "Laughter fills the canteen!" How vivid, how lively. The scene of everyone eating with relish and their incomparably joyful mood are all brought to life on the page. From this, one can imagine the mood and the energy with which everyone goes to production after eating.
    "Everyone says the present times are good, and people's lives are improving step by step." Now, the broad masses are no longer so satisfied with just eating their fill, but are instead demanding to eat well and to eat deliciously. This is not "insatiable greed," nor is it pursuing extravagant eating and drinking detached from the reality of production, but a perfectly legitimate demand. It is precisely this demand that reflects the development of our production. The purpose of our developing production is to gradually improve the people's lives, to enable everyone to ascend step by step in their living standards.
    In the past, feudal nobles and the bourgeoisie were very particular about their eating and drinking. They gathered famous chefs from all over the world to cook for them, and even produced so-called "famous cookbooks." At that time, the working people could not even eat their fill. No matter how many famous dishes there were, they could not enjoy them. These were prepared exclusively for the bellies of those gentlemen. Now, the working people also want to be particular about the taste of their food. This is a major change, and also an "unprecedented" event.
    However, the working people are very realistic. What they are demanding today is not a feast of delicacies at every meal, but simply a diversification of dishes, rich and varied, so that they can eat with relish. The People's Daily supplement on December 15th introduced "A Public Canteen's Menu," which included dozens of items such as five-spice pot stickers, sugar buns, shredded pork noodles, stir-fried chili strips, and braised tofu. Truly: a wide variety of choices, nutritious and abundant, different dishes for every meal, satisfying everyone. Such a canteen, it goes without saying, is constantly filled with laughter.
    The present era is the era for our cooks and our canteen staff to display their talents. In the past, it was "after gathering nectar from a hundred flowers, for whom are you working so hard?" Now it is "one person cooks, and everyone enjoys the aroma, and after licking their lips, they still want to think about it." People have reason to expect them to bring out their skills as much as possible in this glorious position, to create a wide variety of popular dishes, to write economically applicable new cookbooks for the working people, and to turn our public canteens into canteens filled with laughter.
    Eating is not only a matter of livelihood, but also a political issue. People pursue and yearn for a more fulfilling and happy life, and this pursuit and yearning is precisely the driving force for promoting the development of production. As some peasants said, "The more flavorful life becomes, the more energetic we are in production." The public canteen is the center of collective life and welfare. If it is run well, it can greatly mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, consolidate the commune, and improve production. A folk song says: "Eat well and produce with high energy; when production develops, life becomes even more wonderful." There is such a simple yet very important principle between eating and production. After reading the Party Central Committee's instructions on the "Regulations on Doing a Good Job in Several Current Aspects of People's Lives" by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, one's understanding of this principle becomes even deeper.

    笑声满食堂
    陈涛
    “每天开门七件事，柴米油盐酱醋茶”，七件事归纳起来，无非是这“吃喝”二字。
    多少年来，人们为此忙碌奔波，忙呀忙呀，费尽九牛二虎之力，还是填不满肚子。历史上的所谓“圣人明君”，他们虽有兴邦济世之才，步月凌云之志，然而对广大人民的吃饭问题，却束手无策，他们根本不能，也没有想过去解决这个问题。“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”，这就是对旧社会生活的生动的写照。
    真正的圣人是共产党。现在全国农村已经公社化，普遍办起了公共食堂，实现了“吃饭不要钱”，人们已用不着成天为开门七件事绞脑汁了，公共食堂已为大家作了很好的安排，真是“打钟吃饭，不怕你是大肚罗汉”。难怪人们对公共食堂称颂备至。有一首民歌写道：“公共食堂强，饭菜多花样，吃饭不要钱，真是破天荒。”
    吃饭不要钱，这难道不是破天荒的大事么？且看另一首民歌是怎样形容的：“成立大食堂，感谢共产党，饭菜花样多，人人都赞扬，吃得饱又好，笑声满食堂。”
    “笑声满食堂”！多么形象，多么生动，大家在吃饭时那种津津有味的情景和欢乐无比的心情，都跃然纸上。人们由此可以想见得到，大家在吃过饭后，去搞生产时的那种心情，那种干劲。
    “都道如今光景好，人民生活步步高”，现在广大群众对吃得饱已不那么满足了，他们进而要求吃得好，吃得有味道，这并不是“人心不足”，也不是脱离生产实际追求大吃大喝，而是一个正正当当的要求，正是这个要求反映了我们生产的发展。我们发展生产的目的，就是为了逐步提高人民的生活，就是为了使大家在生活上能步步登高。
    过去，封建贵族和资产阶级对吃喝很讲究，他们网罗天下名厨师为他们作菜，还出了所谓“名菜谱”。那个时候，劳动人民连饭都吃不上，吃不饱，名菜虽多，却无法享受。这是专为那些大人先生们的肚肠预备的。现在劳动人民吃饭也要讲究味道了，这是一个大的变化，也是“破天荒”的大事。
    但是，劳动人民现实得很，他们今天要求的不是餐餐山珍海味，只是要求饭菜多样化，丰富多采，能够吃得津津有味。人民日报12月15日副刊介绍了“一个公社食堂的菜谱”，里面有五香锅贴、糖包子、肉丝面、炒辣椒丝、烧豆腐等数十种，真是：品种花样多，营养又丰富，顿顿菜不同，人人都满足。这样的食堂，不用说是时时充满欢笑的。
    现在的时代，是我们的厨师，是我们的食堂工作人员大显身手的时代。过去是“采得百花成蜜后，为谁辛苦为谁忙”，现在是“一人作饭大家香，舐舐嘴唇还要想”，人们有理由期望他们在这光荣的岗位上，把本事尽量使出来，创造出多种多样的大众化的名菜，为劳动人民写出经济适用的新菜谱，把我们的公共食堂都办成充满欢笑的食堂。
    吃饭不仅是生活问题，也是政治问题。人们追求和向往更加美满幸福的生活，这种追求和向往，正是促进发展生产的动力，正如有些农民说的：“生活越过越有味，生产越干越有劲”。公共食堂是集体生活福利事业的中心，办好了，就能使群众的干劲大大发挥，就能使公社巩固，生产提高。有首民歌说：“吃饭吃得好，生产干劲高；生产发展了，生活更美妙”。吃饭与生产之间就存在这么一个既简单而又十分重要的道理。读了党中央对湖北省委“关于做好当前人民生活的几项工作的规定”所作的批示，对这个道理也就认识得更深切些了。
