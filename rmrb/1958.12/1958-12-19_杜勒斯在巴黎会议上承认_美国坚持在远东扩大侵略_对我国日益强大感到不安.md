Xinhua News Agency, December 18th, Paris Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a special speech on the Far East situation at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, explaining the U.S. policy of military provocation against China that has placed the United States in extreme difficulty and isolation.

At the beginning of his speech, Dulles said that the Far East situation is one that makes people "very uneasy and increasingly uneasy," and that "the position of the entire free world in the Pacific and Southeast Asia is a very difficult problem." Dulles said, "Maintaining an anti-communist position in the Far East is a very difficult task, and this task mainly falls on the United States." He stated that the United States will continue to serve as the pillar in the Western Pacific region against socialist and nationalist countries, but he admitted that this "task is arduous and requires great effort."

Dulles then talked about the powerful opponents the United States encountered in carrying out aggressive activities in the Far East. He said: "The purpose of the Chinese Communists is to drive the United States out of the Western Pacific region." "The Chinese Communists are making special efforts to become an industrial and military power." China's commune movement "has produced results in industry." Despite his extremely vile slander of China's people's commune movement, he could not but admit that he "cannot predict" what kind of situation China's construction efforts will bring about.

Dulles threatened that "if the United States withdraws from the Western Pacific region, the entire region will fall under the control of the Communists," and China "will indeed become a formidable force."

Dulles then focused on defending the United States' aggressive policy toward China. He tried to distort the truth of the situation in the region in order to cover up the United States' aggressive behavior and the failures it has suffered. Dulles attempted to portray the tension in the Taiwan Strait as being caused by the Chinese people exercising sovereignty and shelling the coastal islands. But at the same time, he had to admit that it was the United States that "assembled the greatest firepower ever assembled in one place—naval and air force power" in the Taiwan Strait, bringing the region close to the brink of war and rudely interfering in China's internal affairs.

This advocate of the brink-of-war policy explained the U.S. policy of interfering with China's liberation of Jinmen, which was widely condemned in the West, saying that "some people in Europe once believed that the United States should abandon Jinmen and use Taiwan as its defense base." He said that the United States was dealing with "a practical situation" at the time, and abandoning Jinmen "might mean the loss of Taiwan." But he then said that he had personally gone to Taiwan "to try to get Chiang Kai-shek to reduce the troops in Jinmen."

Dulles once again disguised himself as a messenger of peace. He said: The Dulles-Chiang joint communique is a "very significant communique." He also said that in the current Warsaw talks, the United States has been trying to reach an agreement to "renounce the use of force" in Jinmen and Mazu to avoid conflict in the region.

Dulles did try to use the guise of so-called "non-use of force" to pressure the Chinese people to abandon the exercise of their sovereignty and recognize the United States' aggressive behavior against China, but Dulles' shameful conspiracy failed. He said that China has consistently insisted in the Warsaw talks that the United States withdraw from the entire Taiwan Strait area.

Dulles said: "They (referring to China) are not interested in the status of Jinmen and Mazu" unless "that island (referring to Taiwan) is handed over to the Chinese Communists." Therefore, the United States' efforts in Warsaw have not been successful.

Dulles told the ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that he was unwilling to venture to predict the future situation in the Far East. He said that China "has declared their determination to gain control of Taiwan and drive the United States out of the Pacific as a policy."

### 杜勒斯在巴黎会议上承认  美国坚持在远东扩大侵略  对我国日益强大感到不安

    杜勒斯在巴黎会议上承认
    美国坚持在远东扩大侵略
    对我国日益强大感到不安
    新华社18日讯  巴黎消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在北大西洋集团理事会17日下午会议上专门就远东局势作了一次发言，解释使美国陷入了极端困难和孤立境地的美国对中国的军事挑衅政策。
    杜勒斯在发言的一开头就说，远东局势是一种使人“非常不安和越来越不安”的局势，“整个自由世界在太平洋和东南亚的地位是一个非常困难的问题”。杜勒斯说，“在远东保持反共阵地是一项十分艰巨的任务，这项任务主要落在美国身上。”他表示美国将继续担当在西太平洋地区反对社会主义国家和民族主义国家的支柱的任务，但是他承认，这项“任务是艰巨的，需要作巨大的努力”。
    杜勒斯接着谈到美国在远东地区进行侵略活动时遇到的强大的对手。他说：“中国共产党的目的是要把美国赶出西太平洋地区。”“中国共产党正在为成为一个工业和军事强国而进行着特别的努力”。中国的公社运动“在工业中产生了结果”。尽管他对中国的人民公社化运动作了极其卑鄙的诬蔑，但是他不能不承认，他“无法预测”中国的建设努力会使中国出现什么样的局面。
    杜勒斯恫吓说，“如果美国退出西太平洋地区，整个这个地区就会落入共产党的控制之下”，而中国“将的确成为一支可畏的力量”。
    杜勒斯于是着重为美国对中国的侵略政策辩护。他力图歪曲这个地区局势的真象，以便掩饰美国的侵略行为和所遭受的失败。杜勒斯企图把台湾海峡地区的紧张局势说成是由于中国人民行使主权、对沿海岛屿进行炮击所造成。但同时，他又不得不承认，是美国在台湾海峡地区“集结了在一个地方曾经集结过的最大的火力——海军和空军的力量”，使这个地区接近了战争的边缘，并且粗暴地干涉了中国的内政。
    这个战争边缘政策的鼓吹者为美国干涉中国解放金门而在西方遭到普遍谴责的政策解释说，“欧洲有些人曾经认为，美国应该放弃金门，以台湾作为它的防御基地”。他说，美国当时对付的是“一种实际的局势”，放弃金门“可能意味着台湾的失陷”。但是他接着又说，他曾经亲自去台湾“试图使蒋介石削减在金门的军队”。
    杜勒斯再一次把自己装扮成和平的使者。他说：杜蒋会谈公报是一个“意义非常重大的公报”。他还说：在目前的华沙会谈中，美国一直试图取得一项在金门和马祖“放弃使用武力”的协议来避免这个地区的冲突。
    杜勒斯的确企图用所谓“不使用武力”幌子来压迫中国人民放弃行使自己的主权，承认美国对中国的侵略行为，但是杜勒斯可耻的阴谋失败了。他说，中国在华沙会谈中一直坚持要美国撤离整个台湾海峡地区。
    杜勒斯说：“他们（指中国）对金门和马祖的地位不感兴趣”，除非“把那个岛屿（指台湾）移交给中国共产党人。”因此美国在华沙的努力并没有取得成果。
    杜勒斯对北大西洋集团的部长们说，他不愿冒险预言远东地区的未来情况如何。他说中国“已经把他们取得台湾的控制权和把美国赶出太平洋的决心作为一种政策宣布了”。
