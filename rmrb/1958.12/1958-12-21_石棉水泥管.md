    Asbestos Cement Pipes
    The pipes in the picture look like seamless steel pipes. But they are not seamless steel pipes, but high-pressure asbestos cement pipes made of asbestos and cement. They have a wide range of uses in industry and can replace pipes made of steel.
    Asbestos is a mineral that is both fire-resistant and corrosion-resistant. It can be broken down into very fine fibers, and its tensile strength is stronger than that of ordinary steel bars. Asbestos acts in cement like steel bars in concrete.
    The pipes made of asbestos cement slurry by pipe-making machines have high strength. The test water pressure generally exceeds 20 kg/cm² (20 atmospheres), and the external pressure strength far exceeds the design requirements of general urban water supply pipelines. Moreover, its strength can be appropriately increased or decreased according to the needs of various projects by adjusting the ingredients and process operations.
    People may worry that asbestos cement pipes will leak. Tests and use have proved that asbestos cement pipes not only do not leak under high pressure, but also do not allow gases such as coal gas and oil to penetrate.
    The inner wall of the asbestos cement pipe is smooth, and rust tubercles will not grow for a long time. The frictional resistance to liquids and gases is very small. Compared with cast iron pipes, asbestos cement pipes generally have 25% to 40% higher water flow capacity with the same diameter. General cast iron pipes become smaller in diameter as they are used, while asbestos cement pipes do not change. Therefore, using asbestos cement pipes for water supply pipelines can save electricity and maintenance costs.
    The weight of asbestos cement pipes is only one-third of that of cast iron pipes. In construction, especially in mountain areas, the use of asbestos cement pipes is very convenient for transportation. The thermal conductivity of asbestos cement pipes is only one-three-hundredth of that of cast iron pipes. It has the characteristics of heat insulation and heat preservation, so it is very suitable for steam and hot water pipelines, which can reduce the heat preservation devices of the pipeline. Cast iron pipes used as water supply pipes must be buried deeper, otherwise they will freeze and crack in winter. Asbestos cement pipes are not afraid of freezing and cracking, and can be buried shallower, which can also reduce earthwork, speed up construction progress and reduce project costs.
    Asbestos cement pipes are not easy to conduct electricity and are not easily corroded by underground stray currents, making them ideal for cable conduits. Asbestos cement pipes are easier to cut, turn or drill than cast iron pipes. After drilling through the pipe wall, it can also replace seamless steel pipes as filter pipes for deep wells. Asbestos cement pipes have strong resistance to chemical corrosion, unlike cast iron pipes which are easily rusted, and can be used as general chemical industrial pipelines. Asbestos cement pipes have stronger resistance to rapid cooling and heating changes than non-metallic pipes such as glass and ceramics.
    The only disadvantage of asbestos cement pipes is that they are relatively brittle and afraid of large impacts and vibrations. However, its tensile strength is much higher than that of reinforced concrete. As long as you pay attention during handling and construction, this disadvantage can be completely overcome.
    The economic value of asbestos cement pipes is also very large. Calculated on the basis of pipes with an inner diameter of 200 mm, more than 50 tons of steel can be saved per kilometer, and the cost can be reduced by about 20,000 yuan. In the case of China's still insufficient steel production, it is very necessary to vigorously develop asbestos cement products factories. (Wu Xirui)

    石棉水泥管
    照片上的这些管子，看上去和无缝钢管一样。但它不是无缝钢管，而是用石棉和水泥制成的高压石棉水泥管。在工业上具有广泛的用途，可以代替钢铁做成的管子。
    石棉是一种矿物，既能耐火，又能抵抗腐蚀，能分解成很细的纤维，它的拉力比一般钢筋还强。石棉在水泥中的作用就好像混凝土中的钢筋一样。
    用石棉水泥浆经制管机卷制成的管子强度很高，试验水压一般都超过二十公斤／平方公分（二十个大气压），外压强度也都远远超过一般城市给水管道的设计要求。而且它的强度还可以根据各种工程的需要，经过调整配料和工艺操作，适当提高或降低。
    人们可能担心石棉水泥管会漏水。经试验和使用证明，石棉水泥管不但在高压下不渗水，就是密度较轻的煤气和石油也不会渗透。
    石棉水泥管内壁光滑，经久不会生长锈瘤，对液体和气体的磨擦阻力都很小。与铸铁管比，同样口径的管子，石棉水泥管的通水能力一般要高25％到40％。一般铸铁管越使用口径越小，而石棉水泥管却不会起变化。所以，用石棉水泥管做给水管道可以节省电力和维护费用。
    石棉水泥管的重量只有铸铁管的三分之一。在施工中特别是高山地区的工程施工中，使用石棉水泥管非常便利搬运。石棉水泥管的导热性能只有铸铁管的三百分之一。它有隔热和保温的特性，所以作蒸汽、热水管道非常合适，可以减少管道的保温装置。用铸铁管做给水管，必须埋得深些，否则到冬天就会冻裂。石棉水泥管则不怕冻裂，可以埋得浅一些，这也可以减少土方工程，加快施工进度和降低工程造价。
    石棉水泥管不易导电，更不会被地下流散电流所侵蚀，用它作电缆线的套管是最理想的。石棉水泥管不论是切割、车削或钻孔都比铸铁管容易。管壁经过钻孔以后，还可以代替无缝钢管作深井的滤水管。石棉水泥管对化学的腐蚀性抵抗力很强，不像铸铁管那样容易锈烂，可以用作一般的化学工业管道。石棉水泥管对急冷急热变化的抵抗力比玻璃、陶瓷等非金属管材的都强。
    石棉水泥管唯一的缺点就是比较脆些，怕受较大的冲击和震动。但它的抗拉强度比钢筋混凝土的高得多。只要搬运和施工中稍加注意，这个缺点完全可以克服。
    石棉水泥管的经济价值也很大。按内径二百公厘口径的管子计算，每一公里就可以节约五十多吨的钢铁，降低二万元左右的造价。在我国钢铁产量仍不很充足的情况下，大力发展石棉水泥制品厂是十分必要的。（吴希瑞）
