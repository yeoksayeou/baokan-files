It is a Matter of Life, and Also a Political Matter
Xiong Caiyun, Le Ma People's Commune, Shangqiu County, Henan

Our canteen's original cook, Chen Yanji, was a rich middle peasant, full of resentment towards socialism. One day, he would only steam a few baskets of buns and then sleep when he had free time. The commune planted many radishes, cabbages, eggplants, and green beans, but he wouldn't stir-fry them. If anyone went into the kitchen to get some hot water from the pot, he would pour cold water into it. We could only eat five dry buns and drink some cold water every day. Everyone wanted to drink congee, but he refused to make it because he was afraid of the washing up. He also didn't care about the sick. In less than two months, many people lost weight, were sick every day, and production was severely affected. The Party branch believed that the canteen not being run well was not only a matter of life but also a political matter. After debate, it was decided to dismiss him and select outstanding comrades to take on the work of cook.

However, problems arose again when selecting a cook. Some comrades thought that engaging in agriculture and steel production was glorious, and that cooking was a dead-end job, so they were unwilling to do it; others disliked the cooking work because it was dirty and unrewarding. As a result, six cooks were changed in four days. At this time, I remembered what the Party often taught us: "Communist Youth League members should endure hardship first and enjoy benefits later, go where the Party needs them most, and do the work that others are unwilling to do." I thought, at this critical moment, we must not let people with capitalist ideas laugh at us. Would we really be helpless without Chen Yanji? So, I volunteered to be the cook.

The Party branch told me to be a probationary cook for five days first, to see if it was feasible. When my mother found out, she scolded me: "You silly girl, I told you to go to school the year before last, but you refused and insisted on returning home to work in production. Now you've become a cadre, just do a good job! You could still find a good husband. Now you're going to be a cook. Chen Yanji couldn't do it after running a restaurant for decades, how can you, a young girl, do it well?" At that time, many people didn't believe I could learn to be a good cook. I started to struggle myself: My mother only has me as a daughter, I haven't even washed a single sweet potato before, I just wiped my mouth and ran away after eating, can I be a good cook without the skills? Now my mother is unwilling, and others look down on me, what should I do! But then I thought, being a cook was my own request, and it's also what the Party needs most, I should continue to do it. The Party branch also came to tell me not to waver at this time, which made me even more determined.

For the first few days, it rained continuously, the large cage and firewood were wet and wouldn't burn, and coupled with a lack of experience, I didn't cook a single meal properly. People were talking, some saying: "Four cooks can't cook a single meal properly, what do we need them for!" Hearing this, it was like cold water poured on my head, I cried, and my partners cried too. Three of them asked to quit and go to the team to participate in production. I thought this wouldn't do, could we let the observers seize the opportunity? Just when we were in difficulty, the Party branch secretary said to me: "This is a matter of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. You are a League member, this is a test for you. As long as you have drive, learning cooking skills is not difficult." I gritted my teeth and resolved to do it well.

All four cooks were women, and making meals for 107 people a day was arduous. Just relying on drive wasn't enough, we had to mobilize everyone to learn together to do it well. After the four of us discussed it, our hearts were aligned, we said: "We must plant a red flag in the cooking work!" First, we learned from and visited old people with progressive ideas and skills. We worked hard to study and fight hard for five days, and every meal had buns, soup, and vegetables, and the commune members were happy, saying: "The food is really good, better than Chen Yanji."

Later, we also created one jin of sorghum flour to make eight kinds of buns and six kinds of soup, and twenty jin of millet to make a delicious bean porridge for more than 100 people, saving buns and vegetables. Now, every meal has hot buns, hot soup, and four dishes, changing nine ways in three days. We can also free up our hands to bring washing water and boiled water to the commune members. One day, commune member Zhou Fuyun was sick, and I ran more than ten times day and night, delivering water and buns. When there was no white flour, I took the miscellaneous flour from the canteen and exchanged it everywhere. He said with emotion: "When I get better, I will definitely work hard." Whenever guests came, we would warmly entertain them. Once, Hu Ruiying's mother came to see her daughter, we brought water and stir-fried a large plate of dishes. She said: "I haven't eaten such food even at my daughter's home!" After two months of hard work, the canteen has greatly changed, the commune members have gained weight, the sick have been basically eliminated, and the attendance rate has reached 100%.

Looking at the canteen work, it seems to be a matter of life, but who can say that this is not a political matter?

    是生活问题，也是政治问题
    河南商丘县勒马人民公社  熊彩云
    我们食堂原来的炊事员陈彦吉是个富裕中农，对社会主义满肚怨气。一天光蒸几笼馍，有空就睡觉。社里种的萝卜、白菜、茄子、豆角很多，却不给炒。谁要是趁锅滚到厨房里盛点水喝，他就拿凉水往锅里浇。我们每天只能干啃五个馍，喝点冷水。大家想喝稀饭，可是他却怕洗刷麻烦，拒绝做。对病人也是不管不问。这样不上两个月，很多人体重降低了，天天有病号，严重地影响了生产。党支部认为食堂搞不好，不但是生活问题，也是政治问题。经过辩论，决定把他撤职，选派优秀同志担任炊事员工作。
    可是挑选炊事员又发生了问题。有的同志认为搞农业、钢铁光荣，做饭没出息，不愿干；有的嫌炊事工作脏，吃力不讨好。因此四天换了六个炊事员。这时，我想起党经常教导我们的话：“共青团员要吃苦在前，得利在后，要到党最需要的地方去，要干人家不愿干的活。”我想，在这个紧急关头，绝不能让有资本主义思想的人看笑话，真的离开了陈彦吉就不行吗？我就自告奋勇地去做炊事员了。
    党支部叫我去先当五天预备炊事员，看看行不行。我妈知道后骂我：“你这个傻妮子，前年叫你上学你不上，非回家生产不行，当上干部啦，好好干呗！还能找个好女婿，这回你又去当做饭的，人家陈彦吉开几十年饭馆都不行，你这个黄毛妮子就能做好吗？”当时好多人也都不相信我能学好炊事员。我自己也斗争开了：俺娘就我这一个闺女，我过去一块红芋没洗过，吃罢饭嘴一摸窜啦，没有技术能不能做好炊事员呢？如今妈不愿意，别人看不起，怎么办！但又一想，当炊事员是我自己要求的，也是党最需要的，应该干下去。党支部这时也来叫我不要动摇，使我更坚决了。
    开始几天，接连下雨，笼大柴湿烧不着，加上缺乏经验，没做熟一顿饭。人们议论纷纷，有的说：“四个炊事员做不熟一顿饭，要她们干啥！”听到这话，像凉水浇头一样，我哭了，伙伴们也哭了。她们三个要求不干啦，要到队去参加生产。我想这可不行，难道能给观潮派抓住吗？正在困难的时候，党支书对我说：“这是兴无灭资的问题，你是团员，是对你的考验，只要有干劲，学会做饭技术是不难的。”我咬咬牙，下定决心做好它。
    四个炊事员都是女的，一天做一百零七个人的饭是艰巨的，光凭干劲不行，必须把大家发动起来，共同学习，才能办好。我们四个讨论以后，心齐了，我们说：“一定要在炊事工作中插上红旗！”俺几个首先向思想进步有技术的老人学习、访问。苦心钻研、苦战五天，顿顿有馍有汤又有菜，社员都高兴起来，说：“做的饭真好，比陈彦吉强。”
    后来，我们还创造了一斤高粱面做八样馍、六样汤，二十斤小米给一百多人喝一顿可口的豆粖，省馍又省菜。现在顿顿作到热馍热汤四个菜，三天九变样。我们还能腾出手来给社员端洗脸水、送开水。一天社员周付云病了，一昼夜我跑十几次，送水、送馍，没白面我就拿着食堂里的杂面到处去换。他感动地说：“我病好了一定好好劳动。”谁要是来了客人，我们都热情招待。有一次胡瑞英母亲来看闺女，我们给端水，还炒了一大盘菜。她说：“在闺女家也没吃过这样的饭呀！”经两个月的努力，食堂面貌大大改观了，社员体重增加了，病号基本上消灭了，出勤率达100％。
    搞食堂工作，看来是生活问题，可是，谁又能说这不是政治问题呢？
