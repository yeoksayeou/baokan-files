Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 2nd. The Shanghai Railway Bureau, in its freight operations, is implementing "Marshal leads logistics," allowing trains carrying steel 'marshal' materials to transport non-staple foods into the city along the way. In the current situation of insufficient transportation means, this method not only ensures the transportation of steel 'marshal' materials but also smoothly completes the urgently needed transfer of non-staple foods to the city.

Due to the rapid development of steel production in various regions, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has allocated about 70% of its vehicles to the transportation of steel 'marshal' materials in recent months, restricting the large-scale transfer of non-staple foods. However, the supply of non-staple foods to the cities along the line, which are fighting for steel, must be guaranteed. After mobilizing its employees to widely study this issue, the Shanghai Railway Bureau's freight department proposed this transportation method: steel 'marshal' materials such as pig iron, coal, and ore are small in volume and heavy in weight. After the vehicles are loaded, there is still remaining space on top. Now, they are fully utilizing this space, combined with tapping the potential of vehicle load capacity, to load these pre-prepared materials during the time the train stops at the non-staple food distribution stations for water, passing, or detaching vehicles, and transport them to the city together.

According to the Shanghai Railway Bureau's trial loading results, a vehicle with a load capacity of 30 tons can load an additional 20 baskets of about 400 poultry in addition to the usual overload of 36 tons of steel 'marshal' materials. If loading pigs, about 100 live pigs can be added after loading 30 tons of steel 'marshal' materials, which is equivalent to one-third of the loading capacity of an empty vehicle. The Shanghai Railway Bureau currently transports about 50,000 vehicle-loads of steel 'marshal' materials to cities along the line each month. By adopting this method, the timely transfer of urban non-staple foods can be ensured without the need to transfer additional vehicles.

When proposing this transportation method, people were once concerned that loading other goods along the way would prolong the stay of the steel 'marshal' train at the station. The trial loading results proved that after the station made preparations for vehicle, labor, and cargo organization in advance, the time for the train to add water, pass, or detach vehicles at the station was more than enough. Taking the most difficult to load live animals as an example, it only takes three minutes to add 20 baskets of poultry, and it only takes about a quarter of an hour to add 100 live pigs; while the train's water adding and passing time is generally 10 minutes, and the detaching of vehicles is generally more than 20 minutes.

It is common for railways to mix several goods in a whole vehicle at the departure station, but it has never been the practice to load additional goods at intermediate stations to avoid traffic chaos and errors. Live animals are also not mixed with other goods due to fecal contamination. When testing this transportation method, railway workers strengthened the coordination and cooperation between stations and between stations and cargo owners, and took measures such as building wooden frames and laying straw mats before loading live animals, and the above problems were successfully resolved.

On November 30th, the Shanghai Railway Bureau held an on-site meeting at Zhenjiang Station, a non-staple food distribution center, with representatives from the commercial departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and other provinces and cities, as well as major freight stations along the line, to fully promote this new transportation method. The railway bureau also decided to gradually expand the use of this method to transport other agricultural and sideline products to ensure the needs of urban residents. (Attached picture)

    上海铁路局创造运输农副产品好办法
    “元帅带后勤”  副食跟进城
    新华社上海2日电  上海铁路局在货运工作中“元帅带后勤”，让载运钢铁元帅物资的列车，在中途随带副食品进城。在当前运输工具不足的情况下，它既保证钢帅物资的运输，又顺利完成城市迫切需要的副食品的调运。
    由于各地钢铁生产的飞速发展，上海铁路局近几个月来70％左右的车辆投入钢帅物资的运输，副食品的大量调运受到限制。但正在为钢而战的沿线城市的副食品供应又必须保证。上海铁路局货运部门发动职工广泛研究这个问题后，提出了这个运输方法，生铁、煤炭、矿石等钢帅物资体积小，份量重，车辆装载后，上面还有剩余的容积，现在就是充分利用这些容积结合挖掘车辆载重潜力，在列车停留在副食品集散车站加水、会让或者摘挂车辆的时间内，把预先准备好的这类物资突击加载上去，一同运往城市。
    根据上海铁路局试装的结果，一辆载重三十吨的车辆，除了照常超额装载三十六吨钢帅物资外，可加装二十篓约四百只家禽。如果装猪，在装载三十吨钢帅物资后，可加装生猪一百头左右，相当于一辆空车装猪量的三分之一。上海铁路局目前每月约有五万车钢帅物资运往沿线城市，采用这个方法后，不需另调车辆，就能保证城市副食品的及时调运。
    在提出这个运输方法的时候，人们曾经耽心，在中途加载其他货物，会延长钢帅列车在车站的停留时间。试装的结果证明，车站事先作好车辆、人力的调度以及货源组织等工作后，利用列车在车站加水、会让或摘挂车辆的时间已绰绰有余。以最难装载的活口为例，加装二十篓家禽只要三分钟，加装一百头生猪需时也不过一刻钟左右；而列车加水、会让时间一般有十分钟，摘挂车辆一般都在二十分钟以上。
    铁路上整车货物在出发站混合装载几种货物是经常有的，但历来不在中途车站加载以免行车混乱，造成差错。动物活口因有粪便沾污，也向来不和其他货物混装。在试验这个运输方法时，铁路职工加强了车站间以及车站与货主间的联系配合，装活口前并采取搭木架、垫草席等措施，上述问题都顺利得到解决。
    11月30日，上海铁路局在副食品集散地镇江车站，召开有江苏、浙江、安徽、上海、杭州、南京等省、市商业部门及沿线各主要货运站代表参加的现场会议，全面推行这个新的运输方法。这个铁路局同时决定逐步扩大使用这个方法，来运输其他农副土产品，以保证城市居民的需要。（附图片）
