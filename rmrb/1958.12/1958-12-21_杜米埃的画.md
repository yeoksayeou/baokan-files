Daumier's Paintings

The exhibition commemorating the 150th anniversary of the birth of the world-renowned cultural figure, French painter Honoré Victor Daumier, has opened in Beijing. Honoré Victor Daumier was an outstanding French painter and satirical artist of the 19th century, as well as an active democratic fighter. From beginning to end, he stood with the broad masses who were striving for freedom and democracy in France, using satirical drawings to fiercely attack the reactionary rulers of the time.

Daumier's works have been introduced to our country before, with his "Gargantua," "Freedom of the Press," and "The Legislative Belly" being the most familiar to everyone. After seeing this exhibition, I am even more deeply impressed. The false cunning, greed, selfishness, and cruel brutality of the rule of Louis-Philippe and Napoleon III were incisively and vividly dissected by Daumier's powerful pen; at the same time, he also positively extolled the resolute fighting will of the revolutionary masses.

I especially like the painting "You are hungry... You are hungry... That's no excuse... I'm almost always hungry too, but I don't steal because of it!" (pictured above). This is one of the paintings in the series "Judicial Personnel." The author depicts a judge interrogating a hungry vagrant with disheveled hair, spouting the murderous logic of someone who is well-fed and lives in luxury. This painting is not only a satire of bourgeois judges, but also an angry protest against the entire social system. In terms of artistic treatment, Daumier tried to make the picture simple and highlight the main characters. He did not paint the judges as merely ridiculous and insignificant figures; on the contrary, he focused on showing their representation of the power of the ruling class, which made his satire more profound and more to the point.

In today's era where the East wind prevails over the West wind, when the awakened people of the world are rising up against colonial oppression, against imperialist wars of aggression, and striving for national independence and peace, his works still have a role in inspiring fighting spirit. (Ping)

    杜米埃的画
    世界文化名人法国画家奥诺莱·维克多·杜米埃诞生一百五十周年纪念展览会已在北京展出。奥诺莱·维克多·杜米埃是十九世纪法国的一位卓越的画家和讽刺画家，也是一位积极的民主战士。他自始至终和争取法兰西的自由民主的广大群众站在一起，用讽刺画的形式，狠狠地打击了当时的反动统治者。
    杜米埃的作品早已介绍到我国来过，他的“高康大”、“出版自由”、“立法肚子”等都是大家所最熟悉的。我看完这次展览后更留下了深刻的印象。当时路易—菲力浦和拿破仑第三统治下的虚假狡诈、贪婪自私和残酷凶暴的本质在杜米埃的如椽的健笔下，痛快淋漓地一一加以解剖；同时他还正面地歌颂了革命群众的坚决斗争意志。
    我特别喜欢“你肚子饿……你肚子饿……这不是个理由……我几乎每天也肚子饿，但是我并没有因此去偷东西啊！”（上图）这幅画。这是组画“司法人员”中的一张。作者描绘了法官审讯一个头发蓬松的挨饿的流浪者时，而大发那种饱食终日的杀人逻辑的议论。这幅画已经不仅是讽刺资产阶级的法官，而是对整个社会制度的愤怒的抗议。在艺术处理上，杜米埃尽量使画面简洁、突出主要人物。他没有把法官画成一些仅仅是可笑的、无足轻重的人物，相反地，他着重表明了他们代表统治阶级的力量，这就使他的讽刺画更深刻、更能击中要害。
    在东风压倒西风的今天，当全世界觉醒了的人民起来反对殖民主义压迫，反对帝国主义侵略战争和争取民族独立、争取和平的日子里，他的作品仍然有着鼓舞斗志的作用。（萍）
