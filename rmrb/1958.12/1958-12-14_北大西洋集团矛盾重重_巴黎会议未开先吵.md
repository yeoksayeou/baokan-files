Title: North Atlantic Group Riddled with Contradictions: Paris Conference Quarrels Before Opening

Xinhua News Agency, London, December 13th: (Our correspondent Peng Di reports) Ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries have arrived in Paris one after another, preparing to attend a series of meetings starting tomorrow to mend the ever-deepening rifts and sharp contradictions among them.

　　In post-war history, the overall relationship between Western countries has never been as bad as it is now, and contradictions have never been so overt.

　　On the eve of the Paris conference, the London "Times" made this ominous statement: "The disputes concentrated in the Western conference to be held in Paris next week are as numerous as the cars congested in the Place de la Concorde during rush hour." And Britain is at the heart of almost all the disputes.

　　The Paris conference will begin on Sunday with a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, West Germany, and France. In the following days, meetings of the European Commission, the Western European Union, the European Economic Cooperation Bureau, the NATO Defense Ministers, and the NATO Ministerial Council will be held.

　　It seems that the Berlin issue occupies an important position on the meeting agenda, but the serious problems facing Western countries are much deeper than the Berlin issue. Even on the Berlin issue itself, although the major Western countries agree to reject the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city, their attitudes on how to resolve the issue are extremely different.

　　Just as recent events are accelerating the process of NATO's disintegration, there are increasing signs that the United States is trying to use the Berlin and German issues to divert attention from the internal divisions of NATO and slow down the disintegration process.

　　Britain's strategy on the German issue seems more insidious and complex. Its attitude is closely related to another issue on which there is the greatest division in Western Europe - the "free trade zone" versus the European "common market." Although British officials have repeatedly issued statements clamoring to defend Britain's "rights" in West Berlin, many influential newspapers have shown a lukewarm attitude towards the Berlin issue, believing that the "free trade zone" issue is more urgent than the Berlin issue. It is believed that this is to put pressure on West Germany, weaken its political position, and force West Germany to make more concessions to Britain in the European trade struggle.

　　Recent news from Bonn indicates that Adenauer, fearing that Western unity would be split in "the critical period of the Berlin issue," is considering whether to make some concessions in the event that "Britain's attitude towards the common market becomes increasingly tough."

　　This will trigger another sharp contradiction between Britain and France. In order to protect itself, France firmly opposes Britain's "free trade zone" plan. France is also attempting to gain West Germany's support on the Berlin issue in exchange for West Germany's support for France's opposition to Britain on the "free trade zone" issue.

　　Politically, the United States, Britain, and France also have serious differences. The control of other Western European countries by the United States and Britain has greatly damaged France's self-esteem. France has been demanding a greater say in NATO, and it has proposed that the United States, Britain, and France control NATO. This proposal from France has been met with a cool reception in London and Washington.

　　There is also the Cyprus issue, on which Britain and Turkey are completely opposed to Greece, while the United States is prepared to fish in troubled waters.

　　There is also the fishing dispute between Britain and Iceland, in which these two NATO member states almost resorted to force.

　　These are only part of the serious contradictions that have arisen within NATO, and these contradictions are threatening the foundation of this military alliance. The conference may make some attempts to postpone the process of disintegration, but it cannot stop the process.

    北大西洋集团矛盾重重
    巴黎会议未开先吵
    据新华社伦敦13日电  本社记者彭迪报道：北大西洋公约组织国家的部长们相继到达巴黎，准备参加从明天开始的一系列会议，来弥补他们之间日益加深的裂痕和尖锐的矛盾。
    在战后历史上，西方国家间的全面关系从来没有像现在这样坏，矛盾从来没有这样表面化。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”在巴黎会议开幕前夕讲了这样不吉利的话：“集中在下周在巴黎召开的西方会议上的争端，像上班时间拥塞在团结广场的汽车那么多。”而几乎所有的纠纷英国都处在争吵的正当中。
    巴黎会议将在星期日以美、英、西德和法国外交部长会议开始。接着在以后几天将举行欧洲委员会会议、西欧联盟会议、欧洲经济合作局会议、北大西洋公约组织国防部长会议和北大西洋公约组织部长理事会会议。
    看来柏林问题在会议议程上占重要地位，但是，西方国家面临的严重问题却比柏林问题深远得多。甚至在柏林问题本身，虽然主要的西方国家同意拒绝苏联关于使西柏林变为自由城市的建议，它们关于设法解决这个问题的态度极其不同。
    正当最近的事件加速北大西洋公约组织分崩离析的过程的时候，有越来越多的迹象表明美国试图利用柏林和德国问题来分散人们对北大西洋公约组织内部分歧的注意和减缓分崩离析的过程。
    英国对德国问题的策略看来更加阴险和复杂。它的态度同西欧分歧最大的另一个问题——“自由贸易区”对欧洲“共同市场”的问题——密切相关。尽管英国官方三番四复发表声明叫嚷要维护英国在西柏林的“权利”，但是许多有影响的报纸对柏林问题却表现出冷淡的态度，认为“自由贸易区”问题比柏林问题更加紧急。据信，这为的是对西德施加压力，削弱它的政治地位，要西德在欧洲贸易斗争方面对英国作更多的让步。
    来自波恩的最近消息表明，阿登纳由于担心西方团结在“关于柏林问题的危急时期”发生分裂，正在考虑是否在“英国对共同市场的态度越来越强硬”的情况下作一些让步。
    这一点将激起英、法之间的另一个尖锐的矛盾。法国为了保护它自己，坚决反对英国的“自由贸易区”计划。法国并且企图以在柏林问题上支持西德来换取西德在“自由贸易区”问题上支持法国对英国的反对。
    在政治上，美、英、法三国也有严重分歧。美、英两国对其他西欧国家的控制大大损害了法国的自尊心，法国一直要求在北大西洋公约组织中有较大的发言权，它建议美、英、法三国控制北大西洋公约组织。法国的这个主张在伦敦和华盛顿受到了冷遇。
    还有塞浦路斯问题，在这个问题上，英国和土耳其跟希腊的态度完全对立，美国则准备混水摸鱼。
    还有英国和冰岛之间的捕鱼争端，在这个争端中，这两个北大西洋公约组织成员国几乎动起武来。
    这些仅仅是北大西洋公约组织内部所产生的严重矛盾的一部分，这些矛盾正在威胁这个军事联盟的基础。会议可能作一些尝试来推延瓦解的进程，但是并不能制止这个进程。
