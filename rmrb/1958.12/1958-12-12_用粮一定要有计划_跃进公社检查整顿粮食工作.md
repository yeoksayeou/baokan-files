Grain Usage Must Be Planned
Yuejin Commune Checks and Rectifies Grain Work

According to a report in the Hunan Daily, the Yuejin People's Commune in Xiangtan County, Hunan, recently conducted a review of grain usage and dealt with some grain that had not been returned to storage. Some of the stored grain that had become moldy or sprouted was also handled.

Soon after its establishment, the commune discovered serious confusion in grain storage and usage. This was particularly evident in the fact that cadres did not have a clear understanding of the amount of grain, income and expenditure were unclear, and the number of people eating in the mess halls was not accurately determined. The cadres of the original small cooperatives had a "passing the buck" mentality, while the commune cadres were unfamiliar with the situation. Planned grain usage remained only a verbal commitment and was not implemented. 80% of the commune's mess halls did not have dedicated grain managers, and there was no plan for grain usage. A very small number of production teams even engaged in concealing grain production and privately distributing rice. Accidents such as mold, fire, and theft also occurred in grain storage. According to an inspection of twelve large teams, 100,000 jin of grain were piled on the threshing grounds without being stored. In the Niupitang threshing ground of the Renhu team, 30,000 jin of rice were piled up, and 3,000 jin were burned by bad elements. In particular, none of the granaries had management systems, and everyone could use the grain freely. Eating was also unplanned; people cooked as much rice as they liked. The masses had a lot of complaints about this, and someone sang a quick rhyme saying, "Grain usage without weighing, income and expenditure unclear, if this continues, it will be difficult to welcome the new year."

After the commune's grain department reported these situations to the Party committee, it aroused the high attention of the commune Party committee. The First Secretary, Lin Li, personally took charge and organized more than 150 financial and trade cadres and 20 accountants and grain storage personnel from the original small cooperatives to go to the teams to help them universally clear up the grain situation. They also conducted a publicity education campaign among the masses centered on planned grain usage and economical grain usage, and launched a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate against wasting grain and implementing planned grain usage. After the airing of views and debate, the masses' awareness was greatly improved, and grain storage work was strengthened. First, efforts were concentrated on transporting the 100,000 jin of grain piled on the threshing grounds into the warehouses, and the endangered grain was rescued in time, so that state property did not suffer losses. Then, "three checks" and "three comparisons" were carried out, namely checking the accounts, checking the inventory of goods, and checking the number of people eating in the mess halls; comparing income and expenditure figures with inventory, comparing account figures with goods, and comparing grain distribution by population level with the total number of people. The results of the commune-wide inventory showed that, in addition to completing the state grain procurement task and setting aside seeds, feed, and reserve grain, the members' rations had consumed 16,510,000 jin by the end of November, averaging 300 jin per person, exceeding the planned standard by 50 jin.

After the inventory and settlement, they gained a clear understanding of the grain situation, and they also helped the major teams establish and improve grain income and expenditure, storage, and grain usage accounting systems, so that the number of people eating in the mess halls and grain usage accounts, and grain in and out of the warehouse accounts, were consistent with the actual situation. According to age, type of work, and strength of labor, they were divided into seven grades, and the grain consumption standard was re-formulated, with grain rationed to each person, and it was planned to save the grain that had been over-consumed in the previous stage month by month. The authority to approve grain usage was also unified to the commune grain department, and cadres and masses below could not open the warehouse to use grain. All twelve large teams in the commune were assigned full-time cadres to manage grain and established a set of rules and regulations for grain management. In this way, the grain work was well-organized, and the masses were very satisfied. They said that now it is "like a blind man eating dumplings, knowing exactly what he's doing."

    用粮一定要有计划
    跃进公社检查整顿粮食工作
    据湖南日报消息  湖南湘潭县跃进人民公社最近进行了查对用粮情况和处理了一些未归仓的粮食。部分发生霉烂、生芽的仓粮，也得到了处理。
    这个公社刚建立不久，就发现了在粮食保管和使用方面，有严重的混乱现象。突出地表现在干部对粮食心中无数，收支不清，开餐人数也不摸底。原小社的干部存在卸担子的思想，公社干部又不熟悉情况，计划用粮只停留在口头上，没有贯彻执行。全社有80％的食堂没有专人管理粮食，用粮没有计划。极少数生产队里还发生了瞒产、私分稻谷的现象。在粮食保管上也发生了霉烂、火烧、盗窃等事故。据十二个大队检查，有十万斤粮食堆在晒谷坪上没有仓盛。仁湖队牛皮塘晒谷坪上堆放三万斤谷子，被坏分子放火烧掉了三千斤。特别是各个粮仓都没有管理制度，每个人都可以随便动用粮食。吃饭也毫无计划，爱煮多少米就煮多少。群众对此很有意见，有人唱出一首快板，说：“用粮不用秤，收支账不清，长此搞下去，明年难接新。”
    该社粮食部把这些情况向党委汇报了后，引起了公社党委的高度重视。即由第一书记林立亲自挂帅，组织了一百五十多名财贸干部和二十个原来小社的会计以及保管粮食人员，分别下队，帮助各队普遍清理粮食，并以计划用粮和节约用粮为中心，向群众进行了一次宣传教育，并开展反对浪费粮食、实行计划用粮的大鸣大放大辩论，经过鸣放辩论，群众的觉悟大大提高，加强了粮食保管工作，首先集中力量，把十多万斤放在晒坪上的粮食，运到仓里，并及时抢救了危粮，使国家财产没有遭受损失。接着进行“三查”“三对”，即查清账表，查清库存实物，查清食堂开餐人数；收支数字对库存量、账表数字对实物，用粮分等人口对总人数。全社清查结果，除完成国家征购粮食任务，和留出种子、饲料、储备粮等外，社员口粮到11月底止，已吃去了一千六百五十一万斤，每人合三百斤，按计划标准超吃了五十斤。
    经过清查和结算，摸清了粮食底子，他们又帮助各大队建立和健全了粮食收支、保管和用粮账项制度，使食堂开餐人数和用粮账、粮食进出仓账，做到账实相符。根据年纪大小、工种不同，和劳动力的强弱，分成七个等级，重新制定了用粮标准，把粮食定量到人，并计划把前段所超吃的粮食，也逐月节余出来。批准用粮的权限，也统一到公社粮食部，下面干部和群众不能开仓动用粮食。全社十二个大队，都派定了管理粮食的专职干部，订了一套管理粮食的规章制度。这样，使粮食工作井井有条，群众非常满意，他们说，现在才是“瞎子吃汤圆，心中有数了”。
