Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th: Production reports pouring in from factories and mines across the German Democratic Republic indicate that this year is certainly the most successful year in industrial production in the nine years since the founding of the GDR.

Recently, workers in many factories and mines have completed their annual production plans and supplementary plans proposed after the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany ahead of schedule. Factories and mines that have already completed their production tasks include: the largest chemical plant in the country, the Leuna Chemical Plant, as well as many electrical machinery, metallurgical, coal, and non-ferrous metal plants and mines. In the first ten months of this year, the total industrial output of the German Democratic Republic increased by 10.5% compared to the same period last year, and in November it increased by 11% compared to November last year. It is estimated that the total industrial output for the whole year will increase by 10.7% compared to last year, while the original plan was to increase by 6.8%.

In factories with export tasks, workers are honored to complete export tasks ahead of schedule and above quota. Supporting the construction of fraternal countries and "supporting China's Great Leap Forward" has become the driving force for employees in these factories to actively complete their production tasks. In late November, factories and mines with export tasks across the country generally held "mass supervision days" to mobilize the masses to inspect the implementation of production plans.

The clamor of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, especially the United States and West Germany, regarding the status of West Berlin has also become a driving force for the vast number of employees in the German Democratic Republic to work hard in production. Employees in many factories and mines have automatically put forward such slogans: "Let the war provocateurs and aggressors of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization be battered and bruised in the face of our work and peaceful will!" "Put the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's war plan under our forging hammer!" Encouraged by these slogans, they redoubled their efforts to complete and over fulfill this year's production plans.

    民主德国工业战线空前大捷
    预计今年工业增产量将大大超过原计划
    新华社柏林26日电  民主德国各地厂矿传来的生产捷报表明，今年已经可以肯定是民主德国建国九年来在工业生产战线上取得最大成就的一年。
    最近以来，各地许多厂矿的工人纷纷提前完成今年生产计划和德国统一社会党第五次代表大会后所提出的补充计划。已经完成生产任务的厂矿包括：全国最大的洛伊纳化学工厂，以及许多电机、机械、冶金、煤炭和有色金属等厂矿。今年头十个月，民主德国的工业总产量比去年同期增长了10.5％，11月份比去年11月增长了11％。估计今年全年工业总产量将可以比去年增加10.7％，而原计划是增加6.8％。
    在担负有出口任务的工厂中，工人们都以提前和超额完成出口任务为光荣。支援兄弟国家建设、“支援中国大跃进”，成为这些工厂职工积极完成生产任务的动力。11月下旬，全国有出口任务的厂矿都普遍举行了“群众监督日”，发动群众检查生产计划执行的情况。
    北大西洋集团国家、特别是美国和西德关于西柏林地位问题的叫嚣，也成为民主德国广大职工努力生产的推动力量。许多厂矿的职工自动提出这样的口号：“要北大西洋集团战争挑衅者和侵略者在我们的工作和和平意志面前碰得头破血流！”“把北大西洋集团战争计划放在我们的锻锤下！”他们在这些口号鼓舞下加倍努力，为完成和超额完成今年的生产计划而奋斗。
