Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 8th: (By our correspondent) Having achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, Korean farmers have now fully launched a campaign to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, and deep plow the land to strive for an even greater harvest next year.

Responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to expand the irrigated area by one million chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu), Korean farmers began to launch a high tide of water conservancy construction even before the autumn harvest was over. By the end of November, more than 9,400 irrigation projects had been started, which can expand the irrigated area by 300,000 chongbo next year.

When this reporter recently visited the Korean countryside, I saw red flags fluttering everywhere, and groups of farmers working enthusiastically, with newly built irrigation canals crisscrossing the fields. In the irrigation area of the Giyang Irrigation Project west of Pyongyang, which can irrigate 50,000 chongbo, more than 20,000 farmers from five counties are actively repairing canals. Together with the workers who are building this project, they are determined to complete the entire project two years and four months ahead of schedule, by August 15th next year, the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, and to enable the project to irrigate more than 20,000 chongbo of land by next spring.

The small-scale water conservancy projects built by the agricultural cooperatives themselves are also progressing rapidly. The entire northern part of Korea has completed the earthwork for more than 3,400 medium and small irrigation projects.

At the same time, the fertilizer accumulation army of various agricultural cooperatives is setting out in four directions to widely open up sources of fertilizer.

Korean farmers are determined to make next year's crops receive one and a half times more organic fertilizer than this year, and so far, more than half of it has been produced.

Since the beginning of this year's autumn plowing, farmers in various parts of Korea have attached great importance to deep plowing. They have successively transformed the plows of tractors and ordinary plows into deep plowing plows, and they plan to deep plow 30 centimeters during this year's autumn plowing and next year's spring plowing, which is about 40% to one time deeper than in previous years.

    掀起修水利和深耕土地高潮
    农民决心争取明年更大丰收
    据新华社平壤8日电  本社记者报道，今年获得空前丰收的朝鲜农民目前已经全面展开了兴修水利、积肥、深耕土地以争取明年更大收丰的运动。
    朝鲜农民响应朝鲜劳动党发出的关于扩大一百万町步（一町步约合十五市亩）灌溉面积的号召，在今年秋收还没有结束的时候，就开始掀起一个兴修水利的高潮。到11月底为止已经开始动工兴修的灌溉工程达到了九千四百多个，到明年可以扩大三十万町步的灌溉面积。
    记者最近访问朝鲜农村时，看到到处红旗招展，成群的农民们在热情地劳动，新修的灌溉水渠纵横交错。在平壤以西正在兴修的能灌溉五万町步的岐阳灌溉工程的灌溉范围内，有五个郡的二万多农民在积极地修水渠。他们同兴修这个工程的工人们一起，决心提前两年四个月，到明年“八一五”朝鲜解放十四周年时全部建成这个工程，并且要使这个工程到明年春天就能灌溉二万多町步的土地。
    各农业社自己兴建的小型水利工程进展得也很快。整个朝鲜北部已经完成了三千四百多个中、小灌溉工程的土方工程。
    与此同时，各农业社的积肥大军正在四路出动，广泛开辟肥源。
    朝鲜农民决心要使明年的庄稼获得比今年多一倍半的有机肥料，到目前为止已经生产了一半以上。 
    从今年秋耕开始，朝鲜各地农民都很重视深耕，他们纷纷把拖拉机的犁和普通的铧犁改造为深耕犁，要在今年秋耕和明年春耕时深耕三十公分，比往年加深约40％到一倍。
