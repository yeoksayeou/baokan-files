Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 30th. DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il issued a statement today condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government's obstruction of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan and once again strongly demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government take practical measures to enable Korean residents in Japan to return home.

The statement said that the Republic had already clarified its position on the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan in its statement issued on September 16 this year and requested the Japanese government to provide assistance, but the Kishi Nobusuke government has been obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents in all aspects.

The statement said that the realization of the desire of Korean residents in Japan, who are living in great distress under the persecution and suppression of the Japanese government, can no longer be delayed. The statement said that the government of the Republic has made all preparations, including resolving transportation problems and travel expenses, in order to realize the desire of Korean residents in Japan to return to the embrace of their motherland as soon as possible. Currently, Korean residents in Japan in various regions have launched a repatriation movement, and hundreds of thousands of Korean residents have prepared to return home collectively and are ready to depart.

The statement said that various sectors of Japan strongly demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately take measures to actively assist Korean residents in returning home. Various political parties and social organizations such as the Japanese Socialist Party, as well as some individuals from the Liberal Democratic Party, are also assisting the repatriation movement of Korean residents in various regions. More than 100 prefectural and municipal assemblies in Japan have passed resolutions supporting the repatriation of Korean residents.

The statement condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's open opposition to Korean residents returning to the DPRK. The statement pointed out that recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama said that the issue of Korean residents returning home should be resolved politically in the "Japan-South Korea talks." The Japanese Ministry of Justice authorities have notified local authorities not to provide any assistance to the repatriation movement of Korean residents. The Kishi Nobusuke government has recently mobilized the police to threaten and intimidate Korean residents who wish to return home.

The statement said that this clearly shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government is obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents and using them as political capital for the "Japan-South Korea talks." This is an unfriendly attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government towards the DPRK, which has aroused the anger of all the Korean people.

The statement pointed out that these measures by the Kishi Nobusuke government are a gross violation of humanitarian principles and international law.

The statement said that if the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents, it will inevitably be condemned by the people of both Korea and Japan and by broad public opinion around the world.

This newspaper reports: The Japanese government has adopted an unreasonable attitude of obstruction towards the legitimate desire of Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland. Many residents living in Japan are demanding that they be allowed to return to the DPRK. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government, while verbally acknowledging that this is a humanitarian issue, is trying every possible means to detain them and use them as bargaining chips in negotiations with the Syngman Rhee group to "normalize relations," plotting to abduct them to South Korea. Not long ago, the Ministry of Justice of the Kishi Nobusuke government issued a secret notice to the governors of all prefectures, prefectural districts, and prefectures in Japan. This notice reversed right and wrong, insisted that the desire of Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland was a request with "political intentions" according to "instructions from the Korean government," and required Japanese officials at all levels, even if they received applications from Korean organizations requesting assistance for the repatriation of Korean residents, not to take concrete assistance measures.

The General Federation of Korean Residents in Japan issued a statement on the 24th, exposing this despicable practice of the Kishi Nobusuke government. The statement pointed out that Korean residents in Japan live in difficult circumstances, and some have even committed suicide because they cannot maintain their livelihoods. The statement condemned the Japanese government for obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents through means such as issuing such notices from the Ministry of Justice, even though it superficially said that it would treat the issue of Korean residents returning home as a humanitarian issue. The statement pointed out that this notice from the Ministry of Justice contains political conspiracies and is a violation of international law and the Declaration of Human Rights.

The statement stated that Korean residents in Japan will launch a broad movement demanding repatriation with the support of the Japanese people and the people of the world in order to realize their desire to return home.

According to a spokesman for the General Federation, as of the 23rd, 112 prefectural assemblies, municipal assemblies, and mayors' associations in Japan have passed resolutions supporting the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. The spokesman said that the Japanese police authorities are also directly obstructing such trends.

This unreasonable attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government has aroused fierce indignation among the Japanese people. Okada Soji, director of the International Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, as well as Matsumoto Shichiro, Hoashi Kei, and others met with Aichi Kiichi, Minister of Justice of the Kishi Nobusuke government, on the 26th to protest the notification issued by the Immigration Bureau of the Ministry of Justice on December 10 instructing Japanese local governments and other relevant departments to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents. Okada and others pointed out that this practice of the Kishi Nobusuke government will restrict the movement to promote the repatriation of Korean residents.

Ten representatives from youth organizations such as the Youth Countermeasures Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Student Autonomy Association, and the Youth Department of the Socialist Party met with Osamu Itagaki, Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the afternoon of the 26th, and presented him with a written request for the rapid return of Korean residents to the DPRK, and asked Itagaki to forward this request to Kishi Nobusuke.

    朝鲜外务相南日发表声明
    必须让旅日朝鲜侨民实现回国愿望
    岸信介政府的无理阻挠行为违反人道主义和国际法
    新华社平壤30日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日今天发表声明，谴责岸信介政府妨碍在日本的朝鲜侨民回国的行为，并且再一次强硬要求岸信介政府采取实际措施，使在日本的朝鲜侨民得以回国。
    声明说，共和国已经在今年9月16日发表的声明中阐明了对在日本的朝鲜侨民回国问题的立场，并且要求日本政府给予协助，但是岸信介政府却在各方面妨碍朝鲜侨民回国。
    声明说，在日本政府的迫害和镇压下过着十分痛苦的日子的朝鲜侨民回国愿望的实现，已经再不能拖延了。声明说，共和国政府为了早日实现在日本的朝鲜侨民回到祖国怀抱的愿望，已经作好了包括解决运输问题和旅费的一切准备，现在日本各地的朝鲜侨民发起了回国运动，有数十万朝鲜侨民已经作好了集体回国的准备，他们整装待发。
    声明说，日本各界强烈要求岸信介政府立即采取措施积极帮助朝鲜侨民回国，日本社会党等各政党、社会团体以至自由民主党的一部分人士也在各地协助朝鲜侨民的回国运动，日本的一百多个县、市议会已经通过决议支持朝鲜侨民回国。
    声明谴责岸信介政府公开反对朝鲜侨民返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的行为。声明指出，最近，日本外相藤山爱一郎说，朝鲜侨民回国问题，应该在“韩日会谈”中从政治上来解决；日本法务省当局曾经通知地方当局对朝鲜侨民回国的运动不得给予任何帮助；岸信介政府最近又动员警察威胁和恐吓希望回国的朝鲜侨民。
    声明说，这清楚地表明，岸信介政府在阻挠朝鲜侨民回国，并且把他们当作“韩日会谈”的政治资本。这是岸信介政府对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国表示不友好的态度，这激起了全体朝鲜人民的愤怒。
    声明指出，岸信介政府的这些措施粗暴地违反了人道主义原则和国际法。
    声明说，如果岸信介政府继续妨碍朝鲜侨民回国的话，它将不可避免地遭到朝日两国人民和全世界广泛舆论的谴责。
    本报讯  日本政府对旅日朝鲜侨民要求返回祖国的正当愿望，采取了无理阻挠的态度。旅居日本的许多侨民都要求让他们回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。但是，岸信介政府一方面在口头上承认这是人道问题，可是却想尽办法企图把他们扣留下来，作为同李承晚集团谈判“关系正常化”的讨价还价的资本，阴谋把他们劫持到南朝鲜去。不久前，岸信介政府法务省向日本各都、道、府、县知事发出一项秘密通知。这项通知颠倒是非，硬把旅日朝鲜侨民要求返回祖国的愿望说成是按照“朝鲜政府的指令”的有“政治意图”的要求，并且要日本各级地方官，即使收到了朝鲜人团体要求协助朝鲜侨民回国的申请，也不要采取具体协助措施。
    旅日朝鲜人总联合会在24日发表声明，揭露了岸信介政府这种卑劣的做法。声明指出，旅日朝鲜侨民生活困苦，其中甚至有人由于无法维持生活而自杀。声明谴责日本政府虽然表面上说要把朝鲜侨民回国的问题当做人道问题来处理，但是，实际上却通过像法务省发出这样的通知等手段阻挠朝鲜侨民回国。声明指出，法务省的这项通知包含有政治阴谋，并且是违反国际法和人权宣言的做法。
    声明表示，旅日朝鲜侨民将在日本人民和全世界人民的支援下，展开广泛的要求回国的运动，以便实现回国的愿望。
    据总联合会发言人宣布，截至23日为止，日本已经有一百十二个县议会、市议会和市长会等通过决议，支持旅日朝鲜侨民回国。发言人说，日本警察当局对这样的动向也直接进行阻挠。
    岸信介政府的这种无理态度，在日本人民中引起了激烈的愤慨。日本社会党国际局长冈田宗司以及松本七郎、帆足计等在26日会见了岸信介政府的法务相爱知揆一，抗议法务省入国管理局12月10日指示日本各级地方政府和其它有关部门阻挠朝鲜侨民回国的通知。冈田等指出，岸信介政府的这种做法将限制促进朝鲜侨民回国的运动。
    日本工会总评议会青年对策部和全日本学生自治会总联合会、社会党青年部等青年组织的十名代表，26日下午会见了外务省亚洲局长板垣修，向他提出了关于迅速让朝鲜侨民回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的要求书，并且要板垣把这份要求书转交给岸信介。
