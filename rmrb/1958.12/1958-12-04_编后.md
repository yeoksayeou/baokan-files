Editor's Note

    Since the discussion on the division of labor between physical and mental labor began, we have successively published seven articles, most of which were展开 discussion of Comrade Wei Gao's article. This discussion is very necessary. However, not all the arguments in these articles are correct. We hope that in addition to continuing to展开 discussion of Comrade Wei Gao's article, these articles can also be discussed.
    Today's published article "Everyone will be mental laborers in the future" written by Comrade Ren Wei puts forward another aspect of opinions in this discussion, which is also worth studying and discussing.

    编后
    关于体力劳动和脑力劳动分工问题的讨论开始以来，我们连续发表了七篇讨论文章，其中多数是针对魏高同学的文章展开讨论的，这种讨论很必要。但是这些文章中的论点也并不都是正确的。我们希望除了对魏高同学的文章继续展开讨论外，对这些文章也可以进行讨论。
    今天发表的人韦同志所写的“将来人人都是脑力劳动者”一文，在这次讨论中提出了又一个侧面的意见，也值得研究和讨论。
