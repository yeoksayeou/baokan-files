Greatly Develop Socialist Commodity Production and Circulation
Zhang Yifei

Under the new situation of nationwide communization, what changes will occur in commodity production and circulation? Will they shrink, or will they expand and develop? This is one of the questions that everyone is extremely concerned about, and it is also one of the questions that is hotly debated among people. Some people say that after communization, commodity production and circulation will gradually shrink; some say that the scope of commodity production and circulation will shrink, but the absolute amount may still expand; and others say that the proportion of commodity production and circulation will shrink, but the absolute amount may still expand. This article attempts to put forward personal superficial views on this issue for everyone's consideration.

Factors that promote the shrinkage of commodity production and circulation

I personally believe that after nationwide communization, factors that promote the shrinkage of commodity production and circulation have emerged, but there are also factors that facilitate and promote the expansion and development of commodity production and circulation. Generally speaking, commodity production and circulation will expand and develop within a certain period. Let's first look at the factors that promote the shrinkage of commodity production and circulation. This can be clearly seen from the following aspects.

    First, due to this year's great leap forward in agricultural production, the output of agricultural products, especially grain, has increased exponentially. Grain-deficient areas and grain-deficient cooperatives that used to need the state to regulate grain may no longer need the state to transfer grain; or the amount needed has been greatly reduced. Because they are able to be self-sufficient or close to self-sufficient. In this way, the demand for commercial grain will naturally decrease.

    Second, due to the merger of small cooperatives into large cooperatives and the transformation into people's communes, significant changes have taken place in the relations of production. These changes will also affect the scope of commodity production and circulation to some extent. This can be seen from the following aspects:

      1. Within a commune, the adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies of products between agricultural production cooperatives in the past, such as grain, vegetables, melons, and fruits, was exchanged as commodities. Now that they belong to the same commune, there is no need to exchange them as commodities anymore. The commune only needs to distribute them among the teams as products. This part of the past commodity production and circulation has definitely decreased.

    2. Within a commune, there used to be commodity exchange relationships between handicraft production cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives, as well as between cooperatives and their members. Various small iron and wooden farm tools, daily furniture, and parts for horse-drawn carts and handcarts produced by handicraft cooperatives were sold to agricultural cooperatives as commodities. Now that they belong to the same commune, most of them are either directly distributed by the commune or allocated by the commune among its independent accounting units, that is to say, there is no need to exchange them as commodities anymore. This also reduces a part of commodity production and circulation.

    3. The abolition of private plots for members and the reduction of household sideline occupations for members have also reduced a part of commodity production and circulation.

    4. Because the commune implements a distribution system that combines wages and supply systems, with "free food," surplus grain households no longer sell grain, and grain-deficient households no longer buy grain. The so-called revolving grain part of the past, where some members sold grain after the autumn harvest and then bought grain again during the spring famine, has also withdrawn from commodity circulation.

    All these changes have reduced a part of commodity production and circulation. According to some people's investigations, after communization, the volume of commodity circulation within the commune is reduced by about 30% to 50% compared to before communization.

    The above is just the shrinking factors of the amount of commodity production and circulation. More importantly, the nature of commodities has also changed, and the commodity nature is less. It is also incorrect to fail to see this point.

Factors that promote the expansion of commodity production and circulation

    Now, let's take a look at what factors facilitate and promote the expansion and development of commodity production and circulation after nationwide communization.

    First, commodity production and circulation in our country were very underdeveloped before liberation. Although agricultural and industrial production has greatly improved in the more than nine years since liberation through land reform and cooperativization, the proportion of commercial quantity in agricultural products is still relatively small. For example, grain, which is the largest item among agricultural products, accounts for less than 30% of the commodity portion. More than 70% is self-sufficient. This is because before the Great Leap Forward and communization, whether individual farmers or agricultural production cooperatives, the productive forces were still very low, and they had to use most of the land and labor for grain production. Therefore, economic crops other than grain did not have the conditions for high-speed development. Although some economic crops have developed greatly in the past few years, such as cotton, which is expected to increase from 8.89 million dan in 1949 to 67 million dan this year, and tobacco, which is expected to increase from 860,000 dan in 1949 to about 20 million dan this year, due to China's large population, the per capita quantity is still far behind that of economically developed countries. The output of tea and silk in our country has not yet recovered to the highest annual output in history. Now that we have communization, our country has the conditions to develop agricultural production more quickly. For example, when China's grain output reaches 2,000 jin per person per year, the commune can, on the one hand, free up its hands to focus on developing economic crops; on the other hand, with more grain, it can also develop pig and sheep breeding, chicken and duck breeding, making bean products, making flour and wine, etc. All of these, except for a part that is kept for the commune's self-sufficiency, are developing commodity production.

    Second, the state wants to carry out socialist construction and implement socialist industrialization, so it needs the commune to produce increasingly abundant products to supply the needs of socialist construction. Although the state can satisfy a part of this need through taxation, the rest must be obtained through commodity production and circulation. The state's need to obtain products from the commune is increasing day by day, which will inevitably increase commodity exchange with the commune.

    Third, under the condition that the commune implements agriculture as the key point, combines industry and agriculture, and promotes the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, not only will the quantity of products increase day by day, but also many new products will be added compared with the past agricultural production cooperatives (such as meat, eggs, casings, fur, etc.), and agricultural products processed into bean products, starch, brewing, tea, silk, honey, aquatic products, etc. will all increase. The commune will take out a part or all of these new varieties for exchange. Although some communes have a bumper harvest in agricultural production and grain output has increased compared with last year, they feel it is difficult to pay wages except for free food because they have not paid attention to diversified management. This is because they have not paid attention to developing diversified management, developing industry, animal husbandry, and sideline commodity production and commodity exchange. Therefore, in order to pay wages, to continuously increase wages, and to continuously improve the living standards of members, so as to further mobilize the production enthusiasm of members, the commune will inevitably develop commodity production and commodity exchange. Of course, some products of the commune need to first meet the needs of production and consumption within the commune, that is, to develop self-sufficient production. However, the needs of members are limited, and the surplus products must be exchanged with commodities outside the commune. This commodity exchange will increase with the increase of various products of the commune. At the same time, the commune needs to develop diversified management and gradually realize the industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and electrification of the commune, which requires more purchases from outside the commune, especially from the state. This also requires the commune to develop commodity production and external commodity exchange.

    In addition, with the development of production and the increase of income in the commune, the portion of the commune's supply to the living of its members will gradually increase. The items supplied will not necessarily be products that the commune can produce, which requires purchase from outside the commune. And this is likely to increase the overall demand for commodities, because the newly added supplies in the commune are not necessarily items that every member could afford before.

    Fourth, with the development of production and the increase of income in the commune, the wages paid by the commune to its members will inevitably gradually increase. In this way, the cash income of the members increases, and the need for daily necessities not only increases in quantity, but also increases and improves in variety and quality.

    If we examine the factors that shrink commodity production and circulation after communization and the factors that expand it together, we can clearly see that the shrinkage of the quantity of commodities mainly comes from the current short-term situation and the internal situation of the commune. The expansion of the quantity of commodities mainly comes from the future development situation and the external situation of the commune (that is, the national situation). After these two cancel each other out, commodity production and circulation will still be an expanding trend.

    What is the social basis for the need to develop commodity production and circulation after nationwide communization? The social basis lies in the fact that today's commune has several elements of ownership by the whole people, and is the best form for the transition to ownership by the whole people, but it is still not ownership by the whole people, but collective ownership. Because the means of production, seeds, fertilizers, and labor of the commune are still collectively owned by the commune, the products of the commune are naturally collectively owned by the commune. The state can only obtain a small part of the products of the commune through taxation (or allocation), and has no right to allocate the rest. Therefore, the state still needs to use the economic categories of capitalism that still have positive significance - commodity production, commodity circulation, and the law of value, etc. - to serve socialist construction. Specifically, it is to use them to promote the development of commune production and the improvement of social productive forces, and to prepare material conditions for the commune's transition to ownership by the whole people.

    Does this mean that we don't need to put politics in command? No. Politics must be put in command when dealing with the relationship between the state, the commune, and the members. While retaining commodity production and commodity exchange, we must carry out socialist and communist education for the members to overcome the idea of some members that the members come first, then the commune, and then the state. Of course, putting politics in command should not be understood as only caring about the state and not caring about the commune and its members, and arbitrarily "depriving the commune" and taking whatever is wanted.

Several reasons for generating incorrect understanding

    Since commodity production and circulation are necessary and beneficial at the present stage, and are an expanding and developing trend in the future, why do some people think that commodity production and circulation will only shrink after nationwide communization? There may be the following reasons:

    First, some people have a very high enthusiasm for communism and want to enter communism all at once. Because commodity production and commodity circulation are incompatible with communist society, they hate commodities. When these people mention commodities, they immediately think of capitalism, private ownership, private ownership concepts, selfishness, and class and exploitation systems, etc. Therefore, these people want to eliminate commodities and commodity production and circulation as soon as possible. If they cannot be eliminated immediately, they also believe that the fewer commodities, the better, and the sooner they are eliminated, the better. These people have not analyzed and distinguished the essential differences between socialist commodities and capitalist commodities, especially the essential differences between commodities between the state and the commune after our country's communization and capitalist commodities. The commodities and commodity production and circulation that are to be developed after our country's communization are not only not commodities under the conditions of private ownership and capitalism, but also no longer commodities between the state and individual farmers, but commodities between the state under ownership by the whole people and the large collective ownership (commune) that already has elements of ownership by the whole people. And this commodity relationship is carried out under the planned leadership of the state, and is carried out under the leadership of the proletarian party. In this case, this commodity and commodity production and commodity circulation should be developed. Not only will it not lead to capitalism, but it will lead 500 million farmers to ownership by the whole people.

    Second, some people emphasize that the commune is already under ownership by the whole people, and believe that the implementation of ownership by the whole people means entering communist society, so commodity production and commodity circulation are not needed. This is only the good subjective wish of these people, not the actual situation of the commune today. In fact, although the current commune has elements of ownership by the whole people and communist elements, it is not yet ownership by the whole people, let alone entering communism.

    Third, some people have noticed the shrinkage of commodity production and commodity circulation within the commune after communization, but have not noticed the inevitable expansion of commodity circulation between the commune and the outside world, especially with the state, after communization. These people pay close attention to the development of the self-sufficient economy of their own commune. If they lack anything, they want to do it. If they need anything, they want to do it. Some communes want to manufacture cars and tractors themselves, and they also want to produce all the daily necessities needed by the members themselves, and completely achieve self-sufficiency. These people believe that they are omnipotent, willing to "not ask for help from anyone," unwilling to cooperate and divide labor with other communes in production, and also ignore the need for the commune to support and support the state. This kind of economic "independent kingdom" thinking is theoretically incorrect and practically unworkable. The commune should, under the unified plan of the state, adapt to local conditions and strive to produce cost-effective products; in addition to self-sufficiency, it should also carry out commodity exchange with the outside world, exchanging commodities produced by the state and other communes that are more cost-effective than its own production (including both means of production and means of living) to meet its own needs in production and life. This should, on the one hand, develop self-sufficient production, and on the other hand, develop commodity production.

    Fourth, some people, when dealing with the distribution of members' consumption funds, do not consider the material basis of the commune and the degree of awareness of the members, and overemphasize more supply and more packages. There are so-called thirteen packages, eighteen packages, and even full packages, thus ignoring the payment according to work and the wage part. Admittedly, the supply system is the germ of the communist distribution system and a form that facilitates the transition, but we cannot arbitrarily package and supply more based on the degree of production development and the degree of awareness of the members, nor should we arbitrarily package and supply more in order to compress and eliminate commodity production and commodity circulation. In addition, even if there are conditions for more packages and more supplies, it does not necessarily mean the shrinkage of commodity production and commodity circulation in the entire society, but only means that certain commodity circulation within the commune has shrunk, because the packaged portion is not necessarily all produced by the commune itself. For example, if medical expenses are included in the package and medical treatment is free, it can be said with certainty that no commune can completely produce all the medicines needed by its members for various diseases. Since it cannot be produced entirely, it needs to be purchased from outside the commune.

    In order to increase the income of the commune, to improve the lives of the members, to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, in a word, to build socialism and to eliminate commodity production and commodity circulation after the products are extremely abundant, it is necessary to vigorously develop socialist commodity production and commodity circulation at present and in the future.

Postscript

    Commodity production and commodity circulation in socialist society are an urgent practical problem that needs to be solved, and also a theoretical problem that needs to be studied urgently. The economic circles in Beijing recently had a heated discussion on this issue, and there is still no unanimous conclusion on certain issues. Now, cadres and the masses are studying and discussing the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes," and of course they will also discuss the issue of commodity production and commodity circulation. The above article explores whether commodity production and commodity circulation has shrunk or expanded after the people's communes were established. This issue needs to be studied, and other aspects of commodity production also need to be studied. We hope that readers will study this issue in depth when studying the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC.

    大大发展社会主义的商品生产和商品流通
    张翼飞
    在全国公社化的新形势下，商品生产和商品流通将会发生什么样的变化呢？是缩小的趋势呢？还是扩大发展的趋势呢？这是目前大家异常关心的问题之一，也是在人们中间争论比较热烈的问题之一。有人说公社化后商品生产和商品流通会日益缩小；有人说商品生产和商品流通的范围会缩小，绝对数量金额还可能扩大；还有人说商品生产和商品流通的比重会缩小，绝对数量金额还可能扩大。本文试图就这一问题提出个人的粗浅看法，向大家请教。
   促使商品生产和商品流通缩小的因素
   我个人认为，在全国公社化以后，产生了促使商品生产和商品流通缩小的因素，但也有便利和促使商品生产和商品流通扩大和发展的因素。总的说来，商品生产和商品流通在一定时期内将是扩大和发展的。先来看一看促使商品生产和商品流通缩小的因素。这可以从以下几个方面清楚地看出来。
    第一，由于今年的农业生产大跃进，农产品特别是粮食产量成倍的增长，过去一向需要国家调剂粮食的缺粮区、缺粮社有可能不再需要国家调进粮食；或者需要的数量大大减少了。因为它们能够自给自足或者接近自给自足了。这样，商品粮的需要自然就减少了。
    第二，由于小社并大社，并转为人民公社，生产关系发生了重大变化。这些变化也要影响到商品生产和商品流通的范围在某些方面有所减少。这又可分以下几方面来看：
      1、在一个公社范围内，过去各农业生产合作社之间产品的余缺调剂，如粮食、蔬菜、瓜果等，是作为商品进行交换的。现在由于同属一个公社，不需要再作为商品进行交换，只要公社作为产品在各队之间进行分配就可以了。这部分过去的商品生产和商品流通肯定说是减少了。
    2、在一个公社范围内，过去的手工业生产合作社和各农业生产合作社之间以及和各社社员之间是存在着商品交换关系的，手工业社生产的各种小型铁木农具、日用家具、马车手车零件等，都是当作商品卖给农业合作社的。现在由于同属一个公社，其中大部分或者由公社直接分配，或者由公社在所属各独立核算单位之间进行调拨了，就是说，不需要再作为商品进行交换了。这也减少了一部分商品生产和商品流通。
    3、由于社员自留地的取消和社员家庭副业的缩小，也减少了一部分商品的生产和流通。
    4、由于公社实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，“吃饭不要钱”，过去的余粮户不再卖粮，缺粮户不再买粮，过去有些社员秋后卖粮、春荒时再买粮的所谓周转粮部分也都退出了商品流通。
    所有这些变化，都缩小了一部分商品生产和商品流通。根据一些人的调查，在公社化以后，公社范围内的商品流通量较公社化以前约减少30％到50％。
    以上所述，还只是商品生产和商品流通的量的缩小的因素，更重要的是商品的性质也发生了变化，商品性更少了。看不到这一点，也是不对的。
  促使商品生产和商品流通扩大的因素
    现在，我们再来看一看全国公社化以后，有哪些便利和促进商品生产和商品流通扩大和发展的因素。
    第一，我国在解放前，商品生产和商品流通就很不发达。解放后九年多来虽然经过土地改革、合作化，工农业生产有了很大的提高，但农产品中的商品量所占比重仍是较小的。比如占农产品最大项目的粮食，商品部分还占不到30％。70％以上是自给自足部分。这是因为在大跃进和公社化以前，不论个体农民也罢，农业生产合作社也罢，生产力都还很低，不得不把大部分土地和劳动力用在粮食生产上。因此，粮食以外的经济作物也就没有了高速度发展的条件。解放后几年来，虽然有些经济作物有了很大的发展，如棉花从1949年的八百八十九万担预计增长到今年的六千七百万担，烟叶由1949年的八十六万担预计增长到今年的二千万担左右，但由于我国人口多，按人口平均，每人的数量较经济发达的国家还相差甚远。我国的茶叶、蚕丝的产量，则还未恢复到历史上的最高年产量。现在公社化了，我国有了更快地发展农业生产的条件。比如我国粮食产量达到每人每年二千斤时，公社一方面可以抽出手来，把重点放到大搞经济作物上；另一方面，粮食多了，又可以发展养猪羊、养鸡鸭，制豆制品，造粉造酒等等。而所有这一切，除其中一部分留作公社自给外，都是发展了商品性的生产。
    第二，国家要进行社会主义建设，要实行社会主义工业化，就需要公社生产日益丰足的产品来供应社会主义建设的需要。国家的这种需要虽然可以用税收的方法满足一部分，但其余的大部分还必须经过商品生产和商品流通来取得。国家需要从公社取得的产品日益增加，也就必然日益增加同公社的商品交换。
    第三，公社在实行以农业为重点工农业并举、农林牧副渔全面发展的条件下，不但产品的数量会日益增多，而且会较过去的农业生产合作社增加许多新的产品（如肉、蛋、肠衣、皮毛等）、农产品加工成的豆品、淀粉、酿造、茶、丝、蜂蜜、水产品等等，都将会增加。这些新的品种，公社将拿出一部分或全部来进行交换。现在有些公社农业生产虽然丰收了，粮食产量比去年增加了，但因未注意多种经营，除吃饭不要钱以外，发工资即感到困难，这就是因为没有注意发展多种经营、发展工业、牧畜业和副业等商品生产和商品交换。所以，为了发工资，为了不断增加工资，为了不断提高社员的生活水平，以便进一步调动社员的生产积极性，公社也势必要发展商品生产和商品交换。当然，公社有些产品需要首先满足社内生产和社员的消费，即发展自给性的生产。但社员的需要是有一定限度的，多余的产品还得与社外商品进行交换，这种商品交换将随着公社各种产品的增加而增加。同时，公社要发展多种经营和逐步实现公社的工业化与农业机械化电气化，这就需要更多地向社外购买特别是向国家购买生产资料。这也要求公社必须发展商品生产和对外的商品交换。
    另外，公社随着生产的发展，收入的增多，公社对社员的生活供给部分也将逐步增加。而增加供给的物品，不一定都是本公社所能生产的产品，这就需要自社外购买。而这就很可能增加整个商品的需要量，这是因为公社新增加的供给品并不一定就是原来每个社员都能买得起的物品。
    第四，随着公社生产的发展，收入的增加，公社对社员发放的工资也势必逐渐增加。这样，社员的现金收入增加了，对生活日用品的需要不但数量会增加，而且品种和质量也会增加和提高。
    把以上所说的公社化以后商品生产和商品流通缩小的因素和扩大的因素一并来考查一下，就可以很清楚的看出，商品量的缩小主要是从目前短时期的情况和公社内部看的。而商品量的扩大主要是从今后发展的情况和公社对社外的情况（亦即全国的情况）看的。这两者互相对消以后，商品生产和商品流通仍将是扩大的趋势。
    在全国公社化以后还要发展商品生产和商品流通，其社会根据是什么呢？其社会根据就在于今天的公社虽然有了若干全民性的因素，而且是向全民所有制过渡的最好的形式，但它今天仍然不是全民所有制，而是集体所有制。因为公社的生产资料、种子、肥料和劳动力仍然是公社集体所有，所以公社的产品自然也归公社集体所有。国家对公社的产品除通过税收（或调拨）可以取得一小部分外，对其余大部分是无权调拨的。因此，国家还需利用仍有积极意义的资本主义的经济范畴——商品生产、商品流通和价值规律等等来为社会主义建设服务。具体的说，就是利用它们来促进公社生产的发展和社会生产力的提高，为公社过渡到全民所有制准备物质条件。
    这样说，是不是不要政治挂帅了呢？不是的。在处理国家和公社以及社员之间的关系时是要政治挂帅的。我们一方面保留商品生产和商品交换，一方面必须对社员进行社会主义和共产主义教育，克服一部分社员的先社员、次公社、再次国家的思想。当然，政治挂帅也不应理解为只顾国家、不顾公社和社员，随便“剥夺公社”，要啥拿啥。
    产生错误认识的几个原因
    既然商品生产和商品流通在现阶段有必要，又有好处，在今后一个时期，又是扩大和发展的趋势，那么，为什么有些人却认为在全国公社化以后，商品生产和商品流通只会缩小呢？这可能有以下几方面的原因：
    第一，有些人共产主义的热情很高，很想一下子进入共产主义。因为商品生产和商品流通和共产主义社会不相容，因而厌恶商品。这些人一提到商品，他们便立即联想到资本主义，联想到私有制、私有观念、自私自利，联想到阶级和剥削制度等等。因此，这些人很想早日消灭商品以及商品生产和商品流通。如果不能马上消灭的话，他们也认为商品越少越好，消灭的越早越好。这些人没有分析和区别社会主义的商品和资本主义的商品的本质差别，特别是没有区分我国公社化以后国家和公社之间的商品与资本主义商品的本质差别。在我国公社化以后所要发展的商品以及商品生产和商品流通，不但不是私有制条件下和资本主义条件下的商品，而且也已经不是国家和个体农民之间的商品，而是全民所有制的国家和已经带有全民性因素的大集体所有制（公社）之间的商品了。而且这种商品关系是在国家有计划的领导下进行的，是在无产阶级的政党领导下进行的。既然这样，这种商品以及商品生产和商品流通就应该发展，它不但不会引导到资本主义，反而会把五亿农民引导到全民所有制。
    第二，有些人强调公社已经是全民所有制了，并且认为实行了全民所有制就是进入共产主义社会了，因此也就不需要商品生产和商品流通了。这只是这些人的良好的主观愿望，并不是今天公社的实际，实际上现在的公社虽然有了全民的成分和共产主义因素，但还不是全民所有制，更不是进入了共产主义。
    第三，有些人注意了公社化以后公社内部商品生产和商品流通的缩小，而未注意公社化以后公社与外部特别是与国家之间的商品流通的必然扩大。这些人很注意发展本公社的自给自足的经济，缺什么就想搞什么，需要什么就想搞什么，有些公社要自己制造汽车和拖拉机，还要把社员需要的生活日用必需品都由自己生产，并完全达到自给。这些人相信自己万能，愿意“万事不求人”，不愿意在生产方面和其他公社实行协作和分工，也忽略了公社需要国家支持和支援国家。这种经济上的“独立王国”思想，在理论上是不正确的，在实践上也是行不通的。公社应该在国家统一计划的领导下，因地制宜，努力生产合算的产品；除自给外，并与社外进行商品交换，交换国家和其他公社生产的比自己生产合算的商品（既包括生产资料，也包括生活资料），来满足自己生产上和生活上的需要。这就应该一方面发展自给性的生产，另一方面发展商品性的生产。
    第四，有些人在对待社员消费基金的分配问题上，不大考虑公社的物质基础和社员的觉悟程度，过分强调多供给，强调多包，有所谓十三包、十八包甚至全包者，因而忽略了按劳付酬和工资部分。诚然，供给制是共产主义分配制度的萌芽，是便于过渡的形式，但不能不根据生产发展程度和社员觉悟程度而任意多包多供给，也不应为了压缩和消灭商品生产和商品流通而任意多包多供给。另外，即使有条件可以多包多供给了，也不一定意味着整个社会上商品生产和商品流通的缩小，只是意味着在公社内部某些商品流通有所缩小，因为多包的部分不一定都是本公社所能够生产的。比如包了医药费，看病不要钱，可以肯定的说，任何一个公社也不可能自己全部生产自己社员各种疾病所需要的药品。既然不能全部生产，就需要自社外购买。
    为了增加公社的收入，为了提高社员的生活，为了把集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，一句话，为了建成社会主义也为了在产品极大地丰富之后消灭商品生产和商品流通，这就需要在目前和在今后一个时期内，大力发展社会主义的商品生产和商品流通。编后
    社会主义社会中的商品生产和商品流通，是一个迫切需要解决的实际问题，也是一个亟待研究的理论问题。北京经济学界在不久前对这一问题作了热烈的讨论，目前对某些问题还没有一致的结论。现在，干部和群众正在学习和讨论“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，当然也会讨论到商品生产和商品流通的问题。上面这篇文章就人民公社化以后商品生产和商品流通究竟是缩小了还是扩大了的问题作了一些探讨。这个问题是需要研究的，商品生产的其它方面也需要研究。我们希望读者在学习六中全会决议的时候，深入地研究这一问题。
