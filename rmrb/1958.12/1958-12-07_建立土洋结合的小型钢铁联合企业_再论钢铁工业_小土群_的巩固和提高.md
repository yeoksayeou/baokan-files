    Establishing Small-Scale Iron and Steel Joint Enterprises Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods
    ——Re-examining the Consolidation and Improvement of the "Small Indigenous Groups" in the Iron and Steel Industry
    The "small indigenous groups" on the iron and steel front have entered a new stage of consolidation and improvement. One of the important signs of this new stage is that many counties and people's communes have begun to establish their own small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods. For example, Macheng in Hubei and Shangcheng in Henan both built the first such iron and steel joint enterprises in their respective provinces in mid-November. The scale of each is a production capacity of 10,000 tons of steel per year, and the completed steel rolling equipment has reached a capacity of 1,500 tons per year. They have used indigenous steel to roll various types of round steel, square steel, wire rod, and steel plates, and have also drawn steel wire, making steel wire ropes and wire nails. Many other iron and steel bases across the country with the right conditions, such as Guxian in Shanxi and Xushui in Hebei, have also built such small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises; others are under construction or being planned. The iron and steel bases of Jiubujiang People's Commune in Youxian, Hunan, and Yingshan People's Commune in Luzhai, Guangxi, are also installing small-scale rolling mills according to plan. Small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods have developed on the basis of the mass movement of "small indigenous groups." They combine small-scale indigenous mining, coking, iron smelting, and steelmaking in a joint production process. Furthermore, they have established small-scale rolling mills combining indigenous and foreign methods, and installed some indigenous or indigenous-foreign combined forging, wire drawing, and other metal product machines. In this way, they have achieved the transformation of ore into iron, iron smelting into steel, steel rolling into materials, and material production into tools, pushing the mass movement of "small indigenous groups" for iron and steel production onto a new road of integration.
    This kind of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprise combining indigenous and foreign methods, which has emerged in the mass movement, is a prominent new phenomenon on the current iron and steel front. Its emergence and development have important political and economic significance. It points out the direction of development for thousands of iron and steel bases across the country and brings great benefits to 600 million people. From the perspective of iron and steel production itself, integrated enterprises are the most economical and easily managed. They facilitate continuous technological innovation and increased labor productivity, rationalizing and normalizing decentralized and rushed production, and becoming an important force in the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry. From the perspective of the entire national economy, the widespread establishment of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods across the country will greatly promote the industrialization of people's communes and the factory farming of agriculture, and can also greatly promote the development of local industries.
    The emergence of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods is the inevitable product of the development of the mass movement for iron and steel production. In the past two or three months, the broad masses have gone up the mountains to mine ore, smelt iron, and make steel, creating many miracles, but they do not consider this to be the end. Six hundred million people are eagerly demanding the realization of the industrialization of people's communes and the factory farming of agriculture. They urgently need large amounts of steel and machinery and demand their own iron and steel joint enterprises and machine factories as an important material foundation for the people's communes. Therefore, the emergence of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses and cadres. They held grand celebration meetings, eagerly visited, spread the word, and made plans to build more of these enterprises in the short term. We must mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in the production of rolled steel, forged steel, and metal products, so that the iron and steel movement is more closely integrated with the urgent needs of the broad masses, and push the mass movement for iron and steel production to a new peak.
    However, like the emergence of other new things, the emergence of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods is always met with doubts and criticisms from some people. They say: "The products of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods have limited uses and little prospect"; "The production technology of such enterprises is backward and the quality is poor"; "Building such enterprises requires conditions and is not easy to promote." In short, they comment on small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods in various ways. If these arguments are not refuted and doubts are not eliminated, small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods cannot develop rapidly.
    The so-called "limited uses and little prospect" refers to the small scale, small product specifications, and limited variety of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods. This is a one-sided view. The scale of such integrated enterprises is indeed not large, but many a little makes a mickle, and if hundreds of them are built across the country, the output will be very considerable. The specifications of the products are indeed small, but the steel currently needed in the vast rural areas is precisely a large number of small-specification products. Making new agricultural implements, building small machines, repairing indigenous railways, realizing the cart system, laying telephone lines, making steel wire ropes, manufacturing nails, small hardware, steel pipes, etc., for building new commune houses, are mostly small-scale. What's wrong with small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods being able to meet this requirement? Why must large steel ingots weighing several tons be rolled into small steel products in large enterprises and large cities, and then transported to the countryside? The people's communes, adopting the method of self-reliance, build small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods, meet their own large and urgent needs, and share the task of large enterprises in producing large quantities of small steel products, so that large enterprises can concentrate their efforts on producing large steel products and better serve large and medium-sized enterprises and construction projects. This kind of division of labor and cooperation, each getting what it needs and each contributing its strengths, embodies the Party Central Committee's policy of "combining large, medium, and small," so what's wrong with that? Moreover, everything must develop. The current small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods can also develop according to needs and conditions. Small steel ingots can be forged or cast into larger steel ingots; in addition to small rolling mills, some medium-sized rolling mills can also be installed to roll some medium-sized or larger steel products. In this way, it can have a wider range of uses. As for the limited variety, this is only a temporary phenomenon. The small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods that have been built can already roll structural steel, steel plates, and wire rod, can forge various implements, and can also draw wire, twist ropes, and make nails. Some can also make various steel products and metal products such as steel pipes, coils, and steel strips from indigenous steel. From the perspective of development, the variety of this kind of joint enterprise can be increased quickly. Therefore, whether looking at it from the present or from the future, small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods have broad development prospects. Some people's doubts about the limited uses and prospects of small steel products not only show that they do not recognize the position of the "small indigenous groups" and cannot see the positive role of this kind of joint enterprise, but in essence, also show that they completely disregard the interests of the broad masses and lack a mass perspective.
    Some people say that the product quality of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods is not good. But this is a matter of the quality of indigenous steel. Compared with foreign steel, the quality of indigenous steel does have shortcomings at present, but this shortcoming can be overcome, and it cannot be said that indigenous steel is useless. Have we not used indigenous steel to make more than a dozen kinds of high-quality steel, such as stainless steel, high-speed steel, silicon steel, manganese steel, and ball bearing steel? Isn't this the most powerful answer? People who hold skepticism are just using "poor quality" as an excuse to negate the "small indigenous groups." This shows that they do not understand the Party's "small indigenous groups" policy. "Small indigenous groups" and "large foreign groups" are walking on two legs, each with its own role and each with its own position. Foreign steel is produced under modern production technology conditions, and its quality should of course be better and should be better. The steel wire rope for a large crane of one or two hundred tons can of course use foreign steel, but does the vast construction front of the motherland, especially the construction of the vast rural areas, only need the kind of steel wire rope with particularly strict technical conditions for large cranes, and not other steel wire ropes, other steel products, and other steel products? In fact, although indigenous steel has been developed under makeshift conditions, thanks to the wisdom and creative labor of the masses, the quality of indigenous steel and its steel products, after repeated scientific testing, proves that its composition and performance meet the standards. Hundreds and thousands of machines, tools, and metal products made of indigenous steel have proven to be competent in actual use. More importantly, the technology and quality of indigenous steel and steel products themselves are constantly developing and improving. The foundation of this development is the correct leadership of the Party and the infinite wisdom and creative power of the broad working masses. Now, millions of people have launched a vigorous technical revolution movement and created various miracles. We believe that as long as we seriously persist in this technical revolution movement, small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods will surely be greatly innovated in technology and the quality of their products will be greatly improved in the near future. People who hold skeptical views do not admit that the quality of indigenous steel can meet the requirements, cannot see the creative wisdom of the broad masses, and do not believe in the power of the masses, so they cannot see the development prospects of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods.
    Some people say: "Small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods are good, but their construction requires conditions and they are not easy to promote." This exaggerates the difficulty of manufacturing small rolling mills and mastering technology. Facts have proven that people's communes not only need this kind of small-scale joint enterprise, but can also quickly establish this kind of small-scale joint enterprise self-reliantly. According to the experience of Shangcheng, Macheng, and other places, as long as the Party's leadership is followed, plans are made, the secretary takes the lead, and the masses are mobilized, a series of difficult problems from material preparation, equipment manufacturing, construction and installation to production operation can be solved quickly, well, and economically. For example, the main equipment of this kind of small-scale joint enterprise, the rolling mill, only weighs about one ton, and the machine body and rollers can be cast from pig iron, which can be obtained locally. The rolling mill has a simple structure and design drawings are available, which can be imitated everywhere. The farm tool machinery factory in Macheng County can manufacture them in batches. Construction and installation are not too complicated. It only took the Macheng Phoenix Nest Steel Plant seven days from selecting the site, leveling the ground, building the factory buildings, building the furnace to installing the rolling mill, and it was able to put into production. As for production operation, the rolling mill workers in Shangcheng were originally several young peasants who had never seen a rolling mill, but they mastered the technology shortly after the test run and rolled out very good steel plates. Conditions are created by people. As long as we break superstitions, dare to think and dare to do, and use the method of vigorously launching mass movements to run small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods, what Shangcheng, Macheng, and other places can do, other places can also do.
    Geological exploration has proven that at least several hundred counties across the country have iron ore resources. In these counties, there are many iron and steel bases. If we seize this new phenomenon on the iron and steel front, and enable the iron and steel bases with the right conditions to embark on the road of integration and develop into small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods with an annual steel production of 3,000, 5,000, or even 10,000 to 20,000 tons, then the entire layout and production level of my country's iron and steel industry will take on a new look.
    We look forward to the growth and expansion of this new force on the iron and steel front!

    建立土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业
    ——再论钢铁工业“小土群”的巩固和提高
    钢铁战线上的“小土群”已经跨进了巩固和提高的新阶段。这个新阶段的重要标志之一，就是许多县和人民公社，开始陆续建立了自己的土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业。例如湖北麻城、河南商城，都在11月中旬建成了全省第一个这样的钢铁联合企业，规模都是年产钢一万吨，已建成的轧钢设备都达到年产一千五百吨的能力，并且用土钢轧出了各种圆钢、方钢、线材和钢板，还拔成了钢丝，制成了钢丝绳和洋钉。全国其他许多有条件的钢铁基点，如山西故县、河北徐水也已经建设了这种小型钢铁联合企业；还有一些地方正在建设或准备建设。湖南攸县酒埠江人民公社和广西鹿寨鹰山人民公社的钢铁基点，也正在按照规划，安装小型轧钢机。土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，是在“小土群”的群众运动的基础上发展起来的。它把小型土法的采矿、炼焦、炼铁和炼钢组织在一起进行联合生产，而且建立了小型的土洋结合的轧钢机，安装了一些土法或土洋结合的锻造、拔丝和其他金属制品的机器。这样，就做到了变矿成铁、炼铁成钢、轧钢成材、制材成器，把“小土群”的全民办钢铁的运动推上了联合化的崭新道路。
  在群众运动中产生的这种土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，是当前钢铁战线上一个突出的新鲜事物。它的出现和发展，具有重要的政治意义和经济意义。它给全国成千上万的钢铁基点指出了发展方向，给六亿人民带来了莫大的好处。从钢铁生产本身来说，联合化的企业是一种最经济和最便于管理的企业。它便于不断地革新技术和提高劳动生产率，使分散的、突击的生产合理化、正常化，成为高速度发展钢铁工业的一支重要力量。从整个国民经济来说，土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业在全国遍地开花以后，就能大大促进人民公社工业化和农业工厂化，还可以大大促进地方工业的发展。
    土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的出现，是群众大办钢铁运动发展的必然产物。两、三个月来，广大群众上山采矿，炼铁、炼钢，创造了很多奇迹，但并不认为这就是止境。六亿人民迫切要求实现人民公社工业化和农业工厂化。他们愈来愈迫切地需要大量的钢材和机器，要求有自己的钢铁联合企业和机器厂，作为人民公社的重要物质基础。因此，土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业一出现，就受到广大群众和干部的热烈欢迎。他们大开庆祝会，争相参观，奔走相告，并且纷纷作出规划，要在短期内建设更多的这种企业。我们必须发动群众起来大搞轧钢、锻钢和金属制品的生产，使钢铁运动与广大群众的迫切需要更加密切地结合起来，把全民大办钢铁的群众运动推向新的高峰。
    但是，土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的出现，也同其他新鲜事物的出现一样，总受到一些人的怀疑和非难。他们说：“土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的产品用途狭窄，出路不大”；“这种企业的生产技术落后，质量不佳”；“建设这种企业也要条件，不易推广”。总之，他们对土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业评头论足，不一而足。这些论调不驳倒，怀疑不消除，土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业就不能迅速地发展起来。
    所谓“用途狭窄，出路不大”，是指土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的规模小、产品规格小、品种少。这是一种片面的看法。这种联合企业的规模确实不大，但是集腋成裘，积少成多，如果全国建设几百个，产量就非常可观。产品的规格也确实是小的，但目前广大农村需要的钢材，正是大量小规格的产品。做新式农具，造小型机器，修土铁路，实现车子化，拉电话线，做钢丝绳，制造修建公社新房子用的钉子、小五金、钢管等等，绝大部分都是小型的。土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业能满足这个要求，有什么不好呢？为什么一定要从大企业、大城市里，把几吨重的大钢锭轧制成小型钢材，再拉到农村去呢？人民公社采取自力更生的办法，建设土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，满足了自己大量而急迫的需要，分担大企业生产大量小型钢材的任务，使大企业集中力量生产大型钢材，更好地为大中型企业和建设工程服务。这样分工合作，各得其所，各献所长，正体现了党中央“大、中、小相结合”的方针，又有什么不好呢？何况任何事物都是要发展的，现在的土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，还可以根据需要与条件发展。小钢锭可以锻结或者熔铸为较大的钢锭；小轧机以外，还可安装一些中型的轧机，轧出一些中型的或较大的钢材。这样它就可以有更广泛的用途。至于品种少，这只是一个暂时现象。现在建设起来的土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，已经可以轧制型钢、钢板、线材，可以锻制各种器具，还可以拉丝、绞绳、制钉。有些还能够将土钢制成钢管、盘条、钢带……等各种钢材和金属制品。从发展上看，这种联合企业的品种是可以很快增多的。所以，不论是从现在看，还是从将来看，土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，都有着广阔的发展前途。有些人怀疑小型钢材用途狭窄，出路不大，不仅说明了他们心目中没有“小土群”的地位，看不见这种联合企业的积极作用，而实质上，还说明了他们根本无视广大群众的利益，缺乏群众观点。
    有的人说，土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的产品质量不佳。但这是土钢的质量问题。与洋钢比起来，目前土钢的质量的确有缺点，但这个缺点是可以克服的，更不能说土钢没有用处。我们已利用土钢制成了不锈钢、高速钢、矽钢、锰钢、滚珠轴承钢十多种优质钢，这不是最有力的回答吗？持有怀疑论的人说“质量不好”，只是以此为借口，来否定“小土群”而已。这说明他们不了解党的“小土群”方针。“小土群”与“大洋群”，是两条腿走路，各有各的作用，各有各的地位。洋钢是在现代化的生产技术条件下生产的，质量当然要好而且应该好些。一、二百吨的大吊车的钢丝绳当然可以用洋钢，但祖国广大的建设战线，特别是广大农村的建设，难道除了大吊车用的那种技术条件特别严格的钢丝绳外，就不再要别的钢丝绳，别的钢材，别的钢制品了吗？事实上，土钢虽然是在因陋就简的条件下发展起来的，但是由于群众的智慧和创造性劳动，土钢及其钢材的质量，经过反复的科学检验，证明它的成分及性能是合乎标准的。土钢制成的成百成千种机器、工具和金属制品，在实际使用中，已经证明能够胜任。更主要的是，土钢和钢材本身的技术和质量是在不断地发展和提高的。这个发展的基础就是党的正确领导，就是广大劳动群众的无穷智慧和创造力量。现在，千百万群众已经掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动，创造了各种各样的奇迹。我们相信，只要认真把这个技术革命运动坚持下去，土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业在不久的将来必将在技术上大为革新，产品质量也必将大为提高。持有怀疑观点的人不承认土钢质量能够合乎要求，看不见广大群众的创造智慧，不相信群众的力量，所以也看不出土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的发展前途。
    有的人说：“土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业好是好，但建设要条件，推广可不容易。”这是夸大了制造小型轧机和掌握技术的困难。事实证明，人民公社不但需要这种小型联合企业，而且完全可以自力更生地来迅速建立这种小型联合企业。根据商城、麻城等地的经验，只要在党的领导下，作出规划，由书记挂帅，发动群众，就能够多快好省地解决材料准备、设备制造、建筑安装到生产操作等一系列的难题。例如，这种小型联合企业的主要设备轧钢机，不过一吨来重，机身和轧辊可以用生铁铸造，完全可以就地取材。轧机构造简单，已有设计图纸，各地都可仿制。麻城县的农具机械厂就能成批制造。建筑安装不太复杂，麻城凤凰窝钢铁厂从选定厂址、平整场地、修建厂房、建设炉子到安装轧机，总共不过七天工夫，就能投入生产。至于生产操作，商城的轧机工人原是几个青年农民，从未见过轧钢机，可是在试车后不久就掌握了技术，轧出了很好的钢板。条件是人创造的。只要破除迷信，敢想敢干，用大搞群众运动的办法，来办土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，商城、麻城等地所能做到的事情，其他地方也是可以做到的。
    地质勘探证明，全国有铁矿资源的县至少有几百个。在这些县里，有着很多钢铁基点。如果我们抓住钢铁战线上的这一新鲜事物，使有条件的钢铁基点走上联合化的道路，分别发展成为年产钢三千、五千吨、甚至一、两万吨的土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，那末，我国钢铁工业的整个布局和生产水平便会出现新的面貌。
    我们期待着钢铁战线上的这个新生力量的成长壮大！
