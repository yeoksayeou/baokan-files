Xinhua News Agency Report: Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, has adopted measures to protect draft cattle through the winter by establishing cattle farms in areas with lush water and grass and assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for feeding. This has resulted in stronger cattle in many places, and even old cattle have regained their vitality.

Currently, the county has established twenty-two cattle farms, with the largest capable of raising over a thousand head of cattle. After centralized feeding, many draft cattle have experienced varying degrees of weight gain. More than five hundred old cattle raised in a concentrated manner by the Xishan Basic People's Commune have gained thirty to fifty *jin* each in just over twenty days. The Fair Team cattle farm of the Wangcao Basic People's Commune raised fifty-nine thin and weak draft cattle, and they have now all become fat cattle, with prime cattle accounting for 45%.

Suiyang County has a large number of draft cattle, and the county party committee has conducted thorough research on how to quickly improve the current and future feeding management and wintering work of draft cattle. Based on the characteristics of the county's realization of people's communization and the implementation of basic farmland systems, it was decided to establish cattle farms in many areas where land has been returned to forestry and where water and grass are lush. In addition to frequently used draft cattle, the rest are managed by dedicated personnel in separate pens according to age and condition.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the cattle farms, the party committees of various basic people's communes recently transferred a group of party members to work as feeders; appropriate adjustments were made to some unqualified feeders, and some basic communes even mobilized members to conduct a democratic election of feeders. At present, various communes have also organized a portion of the labor force to collect feed and repair the pens for the cattle farms to ensure that the draft cattle are well-fed and have a good rest in the cold winter.

    绥阳在水草丰盛地区放牧
    据新华社讯  贵州省绥阳县采取在水草丰盛的地方建立养牛场和设立专人负责饲养的办法，保护耕牛过冬，使许多地方的壮牛更壮，老牛也返老回春。
    现在，全县已建立了二十二个养牛场，其中最大的可养牛一千头以上。集中饲养后，许多耕牛体重都有不同程度的增加。西山基层人民公社集中饲养的五百多头老牛，在二十多天中，大部分都增加体重三十到五十斤。旺草基层人民公社公平队养牛场饲养的五十九头瘦弱耕牛，现在都成了膘牛，其中头膘牛占45％。
    绥阳县耕牛较多，县委对如何迅速作好当前和以后的耕牛饲养管理和过冬工作进行了充分研究。根据全县已实现人民公社化和实行基本农田制的特点，确定在许多退耕还林和水草丰盛的地区，建立养牛场，除经常使用的耕牛外，其余的都设专人集中按老弱分圈分类管理。
    各基层人民公社的党委为了加强对养牛场的领导，最近还专门抽调了一批党员去当饲养员；对一部分不称职的饲养员作了适当的调换，有的基层社还发动社员对饲养员进行了一次民主选举。目前，各公社又组织了一部分劳动力为养牛场采集饲料和修整房圈，保证耕牛在寒冬中吃饱睡好。
