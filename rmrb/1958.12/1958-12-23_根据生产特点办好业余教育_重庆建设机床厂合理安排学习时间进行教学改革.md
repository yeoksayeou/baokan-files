Run Spare-Time Education Well According to Production Characteristics
Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory Rationally Arranges Study Time and Conducts Teaching Reform

(Based on a report) The Party Committee of Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory has arranged spare-time study time for its employees and led the spare-time school in conducting teaching reforms, all based on actual production needs. From the beginning of July this year to the present, the spare-time school has consistently maintained its regular classes. The enthusiasm of the employees for learning is very high, and the attendance rate is regularly around 95% of the total number of students. The number of participants has increased from 3,000 at the beginning of the semester in June to more than 4,700 at present.

In the past, this factory neglected the characteristics of employees' spare-time education, rigidly applying the rules and regulations and textbooks of ordinary middle schools, which were not in line with actual production nor with the needs of adults. The school's prescribed length of study was also too long, and when production tasks became tight, studies were delayed, further extending the length of study. Therefore, in practice, learning at this spare-time school was often intermittent. Students complained that: "If we keep studying like this, our beards will turn white before we graduate."

The factory Party Committee studied this problem in detail. They believed that to make spare-time education adapt to the current great leap forward in production, it was necessary to tightly grasp these two key aspects: first, rationally arranging and ensuring employees' spare-time study time; and second, vigorously reforming the teaching work of the spare-time school based on actual production needs. The Party Committee, in response to the three-shift production system in the workshops, adopted the method of "grasping both ends and supplementing the middle" to arrange spare-time study time, and organized teachers to reform the school system according to the requirements and characteristics of adults.

The "grasping both ends and supplementing the middle" method involves arranging workers on early and late shifts to study from 6:00 PM to 8:55 PM; workers on the middle shift, who are working during this time, are arranged to make up the study time from 9:00 AM to 11:55 AM the next morning. All workers study twice a week. In this way, the studies of each employee will not be affected by production. Because there are too many students in the school, the Party Committee also adopted the method of studying in separate sections, dividing the students from some workshops to study on the first two evenings of the week, and the others on the last two evenings, so that the potential of teachers and teaching facilities can be well utilized.

In reforming the school system, the Party Committee also, based on the workers' desire to improve their cultural level as quickly as possible and the characteristics of adults' strong comprehension and perseverance, changed the original spiraling high school and junior high school textbooks to a linear progression, deleting repetitive parts and parts that were less related to the factory's production. The original requirement of eight years to reach high school graduation level has now been changed to a five-year continuous system; and the academic year system, which was not suitable for the characteristics of the factory's spare-time education, has been changed to an academic hour system (a total of 2,400 academic hours). The elementary school academic hour (i.e., 45 minutes per academic hour) has been changed to a university academic hour (80 minutes). In this way, the school can flexibly arrange the stages of learning and the amount of courses according to the tightness of production, without being restricted by the terms of the academic year system, and can also do away with winter and summer vacations. This not only speeds up the teaching progress and enhances the continuity of students' learning; but also gives teachers more time for classroom review and questioning, making it easy to consolidate the learning on the spot, solving the contradiction that employees do not have time to review the courses.

Another key aspect grasped by the Party Committee is the teaching reform of the spare-time school. In the past, the teaching situation in the spare-time school was that the teachers did not teach what the students urgently needed in production, and the students did not know how to apply the principles and rules taught by the teachers to practical use. In response to this situation, the Party Committee first organized teachers to go down to the workshops to work. Since April this year, teachers in the spare-time school have been working in the workshops for at least one day per week, signing master-apprentice contracts with workers, and learning from them. After the teachers participated in labor, their relationship with the workers became closer. In the course of joint labor, they began to personally experience why workers urgently demanded to study science and culture, and to understand where the difficulties that workers urgently needed to solve in production were, and what they needed to study immediately. They also realized how to compile textbooks and how to teach in a way that workers could understand thoroughly and quickly. Mathematics teachers compiled the mathematical principles and calculation methods that they discovered during their work in the workshop and that students often used in production, and used them as important content in the textbooks. They also created "Teaching and Production" blackboards and wall newspapers, mobilizing students to participate in teaching reform and answer difficult questions encountered by students in production. Currently, mathematics teachers are starting to write a "Factory Practical Mathematics," including mechanical practical mathematics and electrician practical mathematics, to thoroughly reform the mathematics textbooks according to production needs. After the language teachers worked with the students, they realized that the reason why their teaching was not welcomed by the employees in the past was that there was a serious idea of valuing the ancient over the present in teaching. Therefore, they automatically criticized this idea and selected a large number of articles closely related to the current situation and reflecting the heroic deeds of the working people in the Great Leap Forward as teaching materials; and according to the needs of employees who often write production summaries and make plans, they increased the teaching and writing of practical documents. After the teachers participated in labor, their language became closer to that of the workers than before, and their lectures became easier to understand. The teachers also found many good teaching methods.

### 根据生产特点办好业余教育  重庆建设机床厂合理安排学习时间进行教学改革

    根据生产特点办好业余教育
    重庆建设机床厂合理安排学习时间进行教学改革
    本报讯  中共重庆建设机床厂党委从生产实际出发安排职工业余学习时间和领导业余学校进行教学改革。从今年7月初到现在，业余学校一直都坚持了照常上课。职工学习热情很高，按时参加学习的经常都占学员总数的95％左右。参加学习的人数由6月份开学时的三千人增加到目前的四千七百多人。
    这个工厂过去因为忽视职工业余教育的特点，生搬硬套普通中学的一套规章制度和教材，不切合生产实际，也不切合成人的需要。学校规定的修业年限也太长，遇到生产任务一紧，又耽搁学习，使修业年限更加延长。所以实际上这个业余学校的学习过去常常停停续续。学员们反映说：这样学下去，胡子学白了也毕不了业。
    工厂党委详细研究了这个问题。认为要使业余教育适应当前生产大跃进的形势，只有紧紧抓住这两环：一是合理安排和保证职工的业余学习时间；一是从生产实际出发大力改革业余学校的教学工作。党委针对车间分三班生产的情况，采取“抓两头补中间”的办法来安排业余学习时间，并且组织教师根据成人的要求和特点改革了学制。
  “抓两头补中间”的办法是，将上早班、晚班的工人安排在晚上六点到八点五十五分学习；上中班的工人在这个时间内正在工作，就安排他们在第二天上午九点到十一点五十五分补学习。工人都每周学习两次。这样，使每个职工的学习都不会因生产而受到影响。因为学校的学员太多，党委还采取分部学习的办法，把一部分车间的学员分在每周的前两晚学习，另一部分在后两晚学习，使教师和教学设备潜力能很好发挥。
    在改革学制上，党委也根据工人要求尽快提高文化和成人理解力强、坚持力强的特点，将原来螺旋式上升的高、初中教材，变为直线上升，删减重复部分和与本厂生产联系少的部分。原来规定要八年才能达到高中毕业程度，现在改为五年一贯制；并将不适应工厂业余教育特点的学年制改为学时制（共二千四百个学时），小学时制（即四十五分钟一学时）改为大学时制（八十分钟）。这样，学校就可以根据生产的松紧来灵活安排学习的阶段和课程的多少，不受学年制中学期的限制，也可以不放寒暑假。这样做，不仅加快了教学速度，使学生学习的连贯性增强；并且使教师更有充分的时间进行课堂复习与提问，便于当堂巩固，解决了职工们没有时间复习课程的矛盾。
    党委抓的另一个环节是业余学校的教学改革。过去业余学校的教学情况是，学员生产上急用的教师没有教，教师教过的原理、原则又不会教给学员实际运用。针对这样的情况，党委首先组织教师下车间劳动，今年4月起，业余学校的教师每人每周至少下车间劳动一天，和工人订立师徒合同，拜师学艺。教师参加劳动后，和工人的关系密切了，在共同劳动中，他们开始切身体验到工人为什么迫切要求学习科学文化，了解到工人生产上急切要解决的困难在那里，马上要学习些什么。他们也体会到要怎么编教材，怎么讲授工人才懂得透，懂得快。数学教师们把自己在车间劳动时发现的和学员们提出的生产中经常要运用的数学原理及计算方法汇编起来，作为教材的重要内容。他们还创办了“教学与生产”的黑板报与墙报，发动学员们一起参加教学改革，解答学员们生产中遇到的疑难问题。目前数学教师正动手编写一本“工厂实用数学，包括机械实用数学和电工实用数学两部分，根据生产需要将数学教材进行彻底的改革。语文教师和学员共同劳动后，知道自己过去教学不受职工欢迎的原因是教学上存在严重的厚古薄今思想，于是他们自动批判了这种思想，大量选取密切联系当前形势与反映劳动人民在大跃进中的英雄事迹等文章作教材；并且根据职工们经常写生产总结、订计划等的需要，增加了应用文的讲授与写作。教师们参加劳动后，和工人在语言上也比以前更接近，讲起课来也通俗易懂了。教师们还找到了不少好的教学方法。
