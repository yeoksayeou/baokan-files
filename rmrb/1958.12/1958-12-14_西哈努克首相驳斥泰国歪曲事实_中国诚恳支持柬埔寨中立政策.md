Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 13th: Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk, in a speech at the opening meeting of the Seventh National Congress of the People's Socialist Community this morning, discussed the achievements of Cambodia's foreign policy.

The congress opened under the chairmanship of Cambodian King Suramarit.

The congress will discuss the Cambodian government's attitude towards Cambodian-Thai relations and other domestic issues.

In his speech, Prince Sihanouk pointed out that since Cambodia recognized People's China, the relationship between Cambodia and China has been growing stronger. He said that China sincerely and fully supports Cambodia's neutral policy. China is also helping Cambodia explore iron ore, establish steel plants, and increase imports from Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk also said that the United States also recognizes and respects Cambodia's neutral policy.

Most of his speech was about Cambodian-Thai relations. When talking about the issue of Cambodia recovering the Preah Vihear Temple occupied by Thailand, he said, "I have only fulfilled the first obligation as the leader of the government, which is to defend the national heritage." He said, "I believe that I used peaceful means that comply with the Five Principles and the United Nations Charter when fulfilling my obligations."

He said, "How can people believe the accusation that Cambodia has taken threatening measures against Thailand? How can our small country and its army of less than 30,000 people threaten our powerful neighbor?"

Prince Sihanouk said, "People accuse me of being responsible for Cambodian-Thai relations, saying that despite being unpopular, I still intend to pay all necessary costs in order to preserve power and self-esteem and gain China's support and friendship." He said, "Regarding the assistance from People's China, everyone knows that in our country, which is as transparent as glass, we have not accepted a single Chinese soldier, nor have we received a rifle from China. However, the spokesman of the Thai government just talked about this. The purpose is to belittle my prestige in foreign countries and use all means to permanently remove me from the political leadership of Cambodia." Sihanouk said that his "neutralist" stance is too unyielding for the wishes of some people.

The Cambodian King emphasized unity in his opening address. He said, "In reality, it is impossible to govern the country without the support and trust of the people." He said, "A government that has the support and endorsement of the people can rekindle its courage with new perspectives and continue to work. Similarly, since the people have indeed realized their responsibilities, they will have a broader and more far-sighted view of the issues submitted for their judgment. The prestige of the government and the efficiency of its actions depend on this necessary unity."

### 西哈努克首相驳斥泰国歪曲事实  中国诚恳支持柬埔寨中立政策

    西哈努克首相驳斥泰国歪曲事实
    中国诚恳支持柬埔寨中立政策
    新华社金边13日电  柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王今天上午在人民社会同盟第七次全国代表大会开幕会议上讲话时，谈到柬埔寨的外交政策的成就。
    这次大会在柬埔寨国王苏拉玛里特主持下开幕。
    大会将讨论柬埔寨政府对柬埔寨和泰国的关系所持的态度以及其他内政问题。
    西哈努克亲王在讲话中指出，柬埔寨在承认了人民中国以后，柬埔寨和中国的关系正日益增强。他说，中国诚恳地全力支持柬埔寨的中立政策。中国还帮助柬埔寨勘探铁矿，建立钢铁厂，并且增加从柬埔寨的进口。西哈努克亲王还说，美国也承认尊重柬埔寨的中立政策。
    他的讲话的大部分是关于柬—泰关系的。他在谈到柬埔寨光复为泰国占领的隆端古寺的问题时说，我只不过完成了作为政府领袖的第一项义务，即保卫民族遗产。他说，我相信我尽我的义务时是使用了符合五项原则和联合国宪章的和平手段。
    他说，人们指责柬埔寨对泰国采取威胁的措施，这怎么能够使世界相信。我们这个小国和它不到三万人的军队怎么能够威胁我们强大的邻国。
    西哈努克亲王说，人们指责我应对柬泰关系负责，说我尽管不得人心，仍然打算为了保存权力和自尊心和得到中国的支持和友好而付出一切必要的代价。他说，关于人民中国的援助，谁都知道在我们这个像玻璃一样透明的国家里，我们没有接受一个中国军人，没有从中国接受一支步枪。但是，泰国政府的发言人刚刚谈到这一点。其目的是要在外国贬低我的威信，并用一切手法使我永远脱离柬埔寨政治领导地位。西哈努克说，我的“中立主义”立场对某些人的心愿来说，是太坚持不变了。
    柬埔寨国王在致开幕同时强调团结。他说：“实际上，要是得不到人民的支持和信任，便不可能治理国家。”他说，“得到人民支持和拥护的政府，可以用新的观点重新鼓起勇气继续进行工作。同样，既然人民的确已经意识到他们的责任，他们对于提交他们判断的问题就会有更远大和更开阔的眼光。政府的威信和它的行动的效率都取决于这种必要的团结。”
