Fight for the High-Speed Development of the Motor Industry!
By Our Commentator

The tight power supply and the shortage of electrical equipment are very weak links in this year's industry. Although the manufacturing task of power generating equipment this year has increased four to five times compared with last year, it still cannot meet the demand. Next year, industrial and agricultural construction will continue to develop at a high speed, and the motor industry must keep up closely.

How to ensure the high-speed development of the motor industry? The most important thing is to implement the policy of combining key points with blooming everywhere, and combining "large foreign groups" with "small local groups." All available forces must be organized, especially the repair and manufacturing forces of non-mechanical manufacturing departments must be mobilized to participate in motor manufacturing, so that large and medium-sized enterprises led by the central and provincial (municipal) governments and small and medium-sized enterprises led by special districts, counties, and communes can be combined to form complete sets in coordination with each other. Of the power generating equipment production tasks for next year, more than two-thirds will be undertaken by some large enterprises in Northeast China and Shanghai. These large enterprises have a solid foundation and great potential. As long as the masses are fully mobilized and effective measures are taken, a large-scale harvest can be obtained. For example, several large enterprises in Harbin, after thoroughly breaking with conservatism, vigorously carrying out technological revolution, and deeply mobilizing the masses, have greatly liberated productivity. The Harbin Electric Machinery Plant's power generating equipment production this year has increased more than seven times compared with last year, and a great leap forward can still be achieved next year. The Harbin Boiler Plant, without increasing manpower or equipment, completed the boiler drums required for 400,000 kilowatts of power generating equipment in October, equivalent to two and a half times the output in September, exceeding the design capacity by six times. This shows that these key points must be firmly grasped in order to guarantee the completion of the entire task. However, in addition to large main units, there are tens of thousands of electrical products required for power generating equipment. The manufacture of these products relies more on "small local groups." Hundreds of factories have successfully trial-produced various medium and small-sized power generating equipment in the second half of this year. Their experience proves that as long as the masses are mobilized, superstitions are eliminated, and the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods is adopted, some medium and small-sized products can be manufactured locally, supplied locally, and adapted to local conditions.

Power station equipment must be complete sets to function. However, at present, attention is generally paid only to the manufacture of the main engine of power generating equipment, while the large number of auxiliary machines are neglected, so that valves, instruments, high-voltage porcelain, wires, cables, and insulating materials have become "gaps," affecting the early commissioning of the main engine. Therefore, all regions should arrange the complete set production of power station equipment manufacturing tasks for next year as early as possible, distinguish priorities, and organize collaboration well within the province or economic cooperation zone.

To ensure the high-speed development of the motor industry, a mass technological revolution movement must also be carried out. Over the past few months, the motor industry sector has made some achievements in carrying out the technological revolution movement, but the development of the movement is not deep or broad enough. Some technical cadres still express doubts about the mass line that must be taken in technical work. They stick to old ways, value foreign things over local ones, are superstitious about books, and do not believe in the inventions and creations of the masses. This situation needs to be quickly reversed.

The technological revolution movement in the motor industry should be carried out in two main aspects. One is to accelerate the mastery of large, precise, and cutting-edge products, and the other is to promote a large-scale harvest and fully realize the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results. The decisive links are: improving and simplifying product structures, improving process methods, creating simple special equipment and reasonably adjusting production lines, building production collaboration centers for key components, promoting advanced technologies to increase the capacity of motors and transformers, replacing forgings with castings, replacing steel with iron, replacing copper with aluminum, and replacing metal with plastics, and researching the use of various new insulating materials. Relevant leading departments should pay attention to the timely summary and promotion of various new inventions and improvements.

More than half of the motor industry's production tasks next year will be undertaken by newly built and expanded factories. Whether these projects can be put into production early depends on equipment. To solve these equipment problems, we cannot rely solely on and wait for allocation. Each enterprise should strive for self-reliance by replacing large with small and foreign with local. Next year, the various high-grade alloy steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical materials, insulating materials, oils, fiber materials, and large forgings required by the motor industry will also increase many times accordingly. Relevant departments should take measures as early as possible to expand production of these materials; the motor industry sector should mobilize the masses to study conservation and substitution, and vigorously carry out the "drought resistance" movement. In this way, the difficulties of insufficient raw materials can be overcome through close cooperation between supply and demand, opening up sources and reducing expenditures, and joint operations.

The situation is pressing, the tasks are heavy, the scope of involvement is wide, and collaboration and cooperation are complex. If the motor industry is to successfully pass the great leap forward of next year, it must speed up its pace from the first quarter. The hard work and preparation in this month or so of winter will play a decisive role in the victory of next spring. Seizing this year and seizing preparations are the current urgent tasks of the employees of the motor industry sector. In view of the importance and urgency of ensuring power supply next year, party organizations at all levels should also grasp and supervise this matter as an important task.

    为高速度发展电机工业而战！
    本报评论员
    电力供应紧张、电力设备不足，是今年工业中一个十分薄弱的环节。今年发电设备的制造任务虽然比去年增长了四、五倍，但是仍然满足不了需要。明年工农业建设仍将高速度地向前发展，电机工业也必须紧紧跟上。
    怎样保证电机工业高速度地发展呢？最重要的是贯彻重点与遍地开花相结合、“大洋群”与“小土群”相结合的方针。必须把一切可以使用的力量都组织起来，特别是要把非机械制造部门的修造力量动员起来参加电机制造，使中央、省（市）领导的大中型企业和专区县社领导的中小型企业结合起来，相互配合成套。明年的发电设备生产任务中，有三分之二以上要靠东北和上海等地的一些大企业承担。这些大企业底子厚、潜力大，只要充分发动群众，采取有效措施，就能获得大面积丰收。例如，哈尔滨几个大型企业经过大破保守主义，大闹技术革命，深入发动群众，生产力大为解放。哈尔滨电机厂今年生产的发电设备比去年跃增七倍多，明年还可以大跃进。哈尔滨锅炉厂在不增加人力、设备的情况下，十月份完成了四十万瓩发电设备所需的锅炉汽包，相当于九月份产量的二倍半，超过设计能力六倍。由此可见，必须紧紧抓住这些重点，才能使整个任务的完成有所保证。但是，发电设备除了大型的主机以外，还有数以万计的电工产品。制造这些产品，更多地要依靠“小土群”。今年下半年已经有数以百计的工厂试制成功了各种中小型发电设备。他们的经验证明，只要群众一经发动，迷信一经破除，加上土洋结合的方法，就可以做到因地制宜、就地制造、就地供应一些中小型产品。
    电站设备必须成套才能发挥作用。但是现在一般的只重视制造发电设备的主机，而忽视大量的辅机，以致阀门、仪表、高压电瓷、电线电缆、绝缘材料等都成了“缺口”，影响主机不能早日投入生产。因此，各个地区对明年的电站设备制造任务，要及早安排成套生产，要分别轻重，在省内或经济协作区内很好地组织协作。
    要保证电机工业高速度的发展，还必须开展一个群众性的技术革命运动。几个月来，电机工业部门开展技术革命运动已经取得了一定的成绩，但是运动的开展还不深不广，部分技术干部对技术工作必须走群众路线还表示怀疑，他们墨守陈规，厚洋薄土，迷信书本，不相信群众的发明创造，这种情况需要迅速扭转。
    电机工业的技术革命运动应当从两个主要方面进行。一是加速掌握大型、精密、尖端的产品，二是促进大面积丰收，全面实现多、快、好、省的要求。有决定意义的环节是：改进和简化产品结构，改进工艺方法，创造简易的专用设备和合理调整生产线，建设关键部件的生产协作中心，推广先进的技术以提高电机和变压器的容量，以铸代锻、以铁代钢、以铝代铜、以塑料代金属，并且研究采用各种新绝缘材料。有关的领导部门要注意对各种新的发明创造和改进，及时总结和推广。
    明年电机工业半数以上的生产任务，要由新建和扩建的工厂担负。这些工程能否早日投入生产，关键在于设备。而解决这些设备，不能一味依赖和等待调拨，各个企业应当以小代大、以土代洋、力争自力更生。明年电机工业所需要的各种高级合金钢材、有色金属、化工材料、绝缘材料、油脂和纤维材料以及大型锻件等，也相应地要增长很多倍。对这些材料，有关的部门应当及早采取措施，扩大生产；电机工业部门应当发动群众，研究节约和代用，大力开展“抗旱”运动。这样，供需双方密切配合，开源节流，协同作战，原材料不足的困难就可以克服。
    形势逼人，任务繁重，牵动范围广泛，协作配合复杂，电机工业要过好明年大跃进这一关，必须从第一季度起就加快步伐。而今冬这一个多月的奋战和准备工作，对明春的胜利将起决定性的作用。抓紧今年，抓紧准备，这就是电机工业部门职工当前的急务。鉴于保证明年电力供应的重要和急迫，各级党组织也应当把这件事当作一项重要工作来抓紧领导和督促。
