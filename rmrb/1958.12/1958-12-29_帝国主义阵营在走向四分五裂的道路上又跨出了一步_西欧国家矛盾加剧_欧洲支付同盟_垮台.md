Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 27th: The French government decided in a cabinet meeting held this afternoon to adopt a series of major financial and economic measures, including the devaluation of the franc, the implementation of limited free convertibility of the franc, and the issuance of a "heavy franc."

These measures are directly related to the impending entry into force of the "Common Market" and the British announcement of limited free convertibility of the pound. According to a communique issued after the cabinet meeting, the exchange rate of the franc to the dollar will be lowered from 420 to 1 to 493.7 to 1, a devaluation of 17.55%; francs held by non-franc zone residents will be freely convertible into other countries' currencies, including the dollar, from December 29th; the proportion of unrestricted imports will be increased; and a "heavy franc" will be issued next year to gradually replace the current franc.

France's announcement of limited free convertibility of the franc is a direct response to London's announcement of the same measure for the pound this afternoon. The British action has led West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, and the Nordic countries to take similar measures. French Finance Minister Pinay admitted at a press conference today that France's decision to implement free convertibility of the franc was a forced one. He said, "Because some of our partners have adopted free convertibility measures, we have been forced to take free convertibility measures as well." It is pointed out that France's implementation of limited free convertibility of the franc with only 400 to 600 million US dollars in gold and dollar reserves is clearly taking a great risk.

Regarding the implementation of the franc devaluation, it is not denied here that it is to prepare French goods for competition in the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries. Because the price of French goods is generally 10% to 15% higher than similar West German goods, they are at a disadvantage in competition. The French government hopes to lower the price of export commodities through the devaluation of the franc while raising the price of foreign imported commodities, thereby increasing exports and reducing imports, in order to reduce France's trade deficit and reduce France's demand for foreign exchange. However, this method is only a way of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Setting aside the serious blow that the franc devaluation will bring to the living standards of the French people, since France is a country that relies on imports for many important industrial raw materials, the implementation of the franc devaluation will make all imported commodities, including imported industrial raw materials—coal, oil, non-ferrous metals, etc.—rise in price, thereby causing the price of French export commodities to rise accordingly, bringing unavoidable unfavorable effects to foreign trade competition.

It is reported that the unpopular financial and economic measures decided by de Gaulle even encountered obstacles in the cabinet meeting. The cabinet made the above decision after holding two long meetings yesterday and today. It is reported that some Socialist ministers raised different opinions on these measures. De Gaulle once threatened to resign at the cabinet meeting, forcing the cabinet to pass the above measures unchanged.

Xinhua News Agency, London, December 28th, by our reporter Peng Di: Britain's move to implement limited free convertibility of the pound and France's decision to devalue the franc are signals that the currency and trade war among Western European countries is beginning to intensify.

The decisions of these two countries were announced simultaneously in London and Paris last night. The British Treasury announced that from the 29th, pounds held or obtained by non-sterling area residents can be freely converted into other capitalist countries' currencies, including the US dollar.

Before these decisions were announced, Britain, France, and West Germany had been engaged in a long period of planning and fierce struggle in the triangular dispute behind the scenes. The failure of the "Free Trade Area" negotiations contributed to their decisions. During the "Free Trade Area" negotiations, Britain clashed with France, which was supported by West Germany, and suffered serious setbacks in both economic and political terms.

Making the pound's exchange rate more free is a goal of the British government. The British government wants to use this to strengthen Britain's economic and trade position, and to use it as a symbol of Britain's political prestige. Due to the highly restrictive monetary measures taken by Britain some time ago, and the benefits Britain has obtained in foreign trade due to the reduction in world raw material prices, its US dollar and gold reserves have increased recently. Although the status of its reserves is not really strong, and it is still 1.8 billion US dollars short of the government's safe figure for opening free convertibility—5 billion US dollars—and it still has to rely heavily on US loans or long-term credit, the British government took advantage of France's deteriorating financial situation and hurriedly made the above decision. This will naturally severely hit the French franc, which is not popular in the international market. Many people believe that this is part of Britain's retaliatory action against France.

On the other hand, France has decided to devalue the franc. The franc has now become increasingly worthless and can no longer maintain its official price. The devaluation of the franc, in addition to meaning a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the French people, also means that France will lower the prices of its exports, which will intensify the competition between French goods and British goods in Europe, in particular. However, without the support of West Germany, France cannot independently wage a real struggle against Britain. Therefore, the alliance between France and West Germany is making France increasingly move towards the status of a satellite state of West Germany. At the same time, the French franc will be linked to the West German mark; West Germany will provide huge loans to help France overcome some of its current financial and trade difficulties.

This new combination of France and West Germany is not only aimed at squeezing Britain out of the European market economically, but also intends to oppose Britain's attempt to control them in the North Atlantic Group with the help of the United States by using the theory of "interdependence" that it has created.

Due to these recent developments, the entire "European Economic Cooperation Organization" has fallen into chaos. The "European Payments Union," established in 1950 within the scope of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization," suddenly collapsed in one day yesterday. The purpose of this "European Payments Union" was to provide credit to Western European countries with trade deficits. What will replace it is a "European Monetary Agreement," but the new "European Monetary Agreement" is not only unfavorable to France in terms of payment systems, but also requires that the debts during the "European Payments Union" period be cleared, and the largest debtor in the "European Payments Union" at present is France. Therefore, at present, the end of the "European Payments Union" is another blow to France's financial position.

While the details of these recent decisions in Western Europe are still being worked out, a state of confusion has already emerged. British officials blame France for devaluing the franc, thereby forcing Britain to take the immature decision to implement limited free convertibility of the pound. On the other hand, French officials are fiercely attacking Britain, saying that Britain's actions are aimed at weakening France's position.

Labor Party leader Gaitskell, commenting on Britain's decision last night, said, "I think this decision to dissolve the 'European Payments Union' and make the pound freely convertible is a serious mistake. When there is a real danger of establishing new trade barriers, destroying the 'European Payments Union' is certainly the most unwise."

On the other hand, the United States immediately expressed its happiness with the implementation of limited free convertibility of the pound and other Western European currencies. The United States, which has long been in a trade surplus position with Western European countries, has long hoped that this situation would occur. The current infighting among Western European countries has allowed it to reap the benefits. (Attached picture)

    帝国主义阵营在走向四分五裂的道路上又跨出了一步
    西欧国家矛盾加剧“欧洲支付同盟”垮台
    英国在法郎贬值同时宣布英镑有限度自由兑换
    西德等国采取同样措施  西欧已出现混乱状态
    新华社巴黎27日电  法国政府在今天下午举行的内阁会议上决定采取一系列重大财政经济措施，包括法郎贬值、实行有限度的法郎自由兑换和发行一种“重法郎”。
    这些措施是同“共同市场”即将生效以及英国宣布有限度地实行英镑自由兑换直接有关的。据内阁会议后发表的公报宣布，法郎同美元的比价将从四二○比一降低为四九三·七比一，即贬值17.55％；非法郎区居民所持有的法郎从12月29日起将可以自由兑换其他国家的货币，包括美元在内；增加不受限制的进口的比重；在明年内发行一种“重法郎”来逐步代替目前的法郎。
    法国宣布实行有限度的法郎自由兑换是伦敦同一天下午宣布英镑有限度自由兑换这一措施的直接反应。英国的行动已经使得西德、荷、比、卢、意大利以及北欧国家采取同样的措施。法国财政部长比内在今天的记者招待会上承认，法国采取自由兑换法郎的决定是迫不得已的。他说，“由于我们有些合伙国采取了自由兑换措施，我们被迫也采取自由兑换措施。”人们指出，以法国目前手头仅有的四亿至六亿美元的黄金美元储备而实行法郎有限度的自由兑换显然是冒着极大风险的。
    关于实行法郎贬值，此间人士并不讳言是为了替法国商品进入西欧六国“共同市场”的竞争作准备。因为，法国商品的价格一般比同类西德商品要贵10％至15％，因此在竞争上处于不利地位。法国政府希望通过法郎贬值降低出口商品的价格，同时抬高外国进口商品价格，从而增加出口，减少入口，以减少法国贸易的赤字，并减少法国对外汇的需求。但是，这种办法只是一种挖肉补疮的办法。撇开法郎贬值将给法国人的生活水平带来严重打击不说，由于法国是一个许多重要工业原料有赖进口的国家，因此，实行法郎贬值，将使一切进口商品，也包括进口的工业原料——煤、石油、非铁金属等等价格上涨，从而使法国的出口商品的价格随之上涨，给对外贸易的竞争带来无法避免的不利的影响。
    有消息说，戴高乐决定采取的这些不得人心的财经措施甚至在内阁会议上也遇到了障碍。内阁是在昨天和今天连续举行了两次历时很久的会议之后，才作出上述决定的。消息说，有些社会党人部长对这些措施提了不同意见。戴高乐曾经在内阁会上以辞职相要挟，迫使内阁原封不动地通过了上述措施。
    新华社伦敦28日电  本社记者彭迪报道：英国实行英镑可以有限度地自由兑换的行动以及法国决定把法郎贬值的决定是西欧国家货币和贸易战开始尖锐化的信号。
    这两国的决定是昨晚在伦敦和巴黎同时宣布的。英国财政部宣布，从29日起，凡非英镑区居民持有的或获得的英镑可以自由地兑换其他资本主义国家货币，包括美元在内。
    在这些决定宣布以前，英国、法国和西德在幕后的三角争吵中已经进行了长时间的策划和激烈的斗争。“自由贸易区”谈判遭到失败促成了它们的决定。在“自由贸易区”问题谈判时期，英国同得到西德支持的法国交手，在经济和政治两方面却遭到了严重挫折。
    使英镑的兑换能更自由，是英国政府的一个目标。英国政府想以此加强英国的经济和贸易地位，并且以此作为英国政治威望的一种象征。由于英国前些时候采取的高度限制性的货币措施，以及英国由于世界原料价格降低而在对外贸易方面所得到的好处，它的美元和黄金储备近来已有增加。尽管它的储备的地位并不真正强固，距离政府认为足以开放自由兑换的保险的数字——五十亿美元——还差十八亿美元，而且它仍然得大大地依靠美国的贷款或长期信贷，英国政府却利用了法国日益恶化的财政形势，匆促地作出了上述决定。这样一来，自然会严重地打击本来在国际市场上就不吃香的法国法郎。许多人都认为，这是英国对法国的报复行动的一部分。
    在另一方面，法国已决定使法郎贬值。法郎现在已变得愈来愈不值钱了，因此不能够再维持它的官价。法郎贬值除了意味着大大地削减法国人民的购买力外，还意味着法国将降低它的出口品的价格，这就将使法国特别是同英国货品在欧洲的竞争激烈起来。但是，如果没有西德的支持，法国是不能够独立地对英国进行真正的斗争的。因此，法国同西德的联合，使得法国愈来愈走向西德的一个卫星国的地位，同时法国法郎将同西德马克联系起来；西德将拿出巨额贷款以帮助法国度过它目前的某些财政和贸易困难。
    法国同西德的这种新的结合，不单是在经济上想要在欧洲市场上排挤英国，而且还打算反对英国用它所制造的“相互依赖”的理论，在美国的帮助下在北大西洋集团中控制它们的企图。
    由于这些最近发生的事态，整个“欧洲经济合作局”已陷入一片混乱。1950年在“欧洲经济合作局”范围内成立的“欧洲支付同盟”，在昨天一天之内突然垮台了。这个
  “欧洲支付同盟”的目的在于对发生贸易逆差的西欧国家给予信贷。代替它的将是一个“欧洲货币协定”，但是新的“欧洲货币协定”，不仅在支付制度方面对法国不利，而且“欧洲支付同盟”时期的债务将要设法清偿，而“欧洲支付同盟”中目前最大的债户是法国。因此，在目前，“欧洲支付同盟”的结束是对法国财政地位的另一个打击。
    在西欧最近这些决定的细节尚待拟定的时候，混乱状态已经出现。英国人士责怪法国使法郎贬值，从而迫使英国采取了实行英镑有限度的自由兑换的不成熟的决定。而法国人士却猛烈地攻击英国，说英国的行动是想要削弱法国的地位。
    工党领袖盖茨克尔昨晚在评论英国的决定时说，“我认为这个将解散‘欧洲支付同盟’和使英镑自由兑换的决定是一个严重的错误。当存在着建立新的贸易壁垒的真正危险的时候，摧毁‘欧洲支付同盟’肯定是最不明智的。”
    另一方面，美国却立刻对英镑以及其他西欧货币的实行有限度的自由兑换表示高兴。美国由于一直对西欧各国处于贸易出超地位，长久以来希望能够出现这一局面。目前西欧国家的相互争斗，使它收得了渔人之利。（附图片）
