Xinhua News Agency report: Newspapers in countries such as Cambodia and Argentina continue to pay attention to the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy. The Cambodian "Telegraph" published an editorial on December 3 on the outline of the Soviet seven-year plan, saying: "All commentators in the Western world are paying attention to the unprecedented figures of the Soviet seven-year plan that is about to be implemented. This is indeed a challenge from the entire socialist camp to the capitalist countries."

This newspaper pointed out that according to the provisions of this new plan, the Soviet Union's industrial production will increase by 80% and agricultural production will increase by 70%. These figures are not unfounded, because it provides concrete details.

The editorial specifically traced the Soviet Union's achievements in agriculture, and said: "Let us also not forget that the vast land of Siberia is no longer a place of exile, but a place that the Soviet Union attaches importance to first, and it is very likely to provide solutions for the current needs of mankind in a short period of time. This will inevitably form an attraction to the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa, while the United States can only offer promises about the Colombo Plan with limited achievements."

The Argentine weekly "Our Word" published an article on November 27 entitled "The Soviet Seven-Year Plan that Shook the World," commenting on the great significance of the draft of the Soviet seven-year long-term plan.

The article said: "On the second day of the socialist revolution in Russia, prophets all over the world clamored that the Soviet state could not support even a year, a month, or a day." This "tragic prediction not only came from 'experts' in Russian affairs in London and New York, but also from false Marxists who did not understand or were unwilling to understand Lenin's theory of imperialism and the theory of the possibility of achieving socialism in one country."

The article then said that the Soviet Union withstood the economic and military blockade, interventionist wars, and Nazi fascist attacks of the capitalist world for a day, a month, a year. In forty-one years, the Soviet Union has surpassed all countries in terms of production development speed and has become the second industrial power in the world.

The article emphasized that the irresistible power of the Soviet state has opened the door for mankind to the communist future. The article continued, when the seven-year long-term plan for the national economy is completed, the Soviet Union will surpass all capitalist countries, including the United States, in terms of total industrial output and per capita production. The article said, "This new plan is not the product of cabinet research, but the expression of the people's creativity."

The article introduced the inspiring achievements that the draft of the Soviet seven-year long-term plan will achieve in production, improvement of living standards, and the combination of mental and physical labor. The article then said, "It is easy to understand how important it is to maintain peace in order to realize these grand plans. Striving for the benefit of peace is not just a word for the Soviet Union, but an essential part of it." The article pointed out, "It is very obvious that the Soviet Union will surpass the United States and the entire capitalism in the peace competition."

    柬埔寨和阿根廷等国报刊指出
    苏联七年计划震动全球
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：苏联发展国民经济的七年计划，继续受到各国舆论的重视。柬埔寨“电讯报”3日就苏联七年计划提纲发表社论说：“所有西方世界的评论家都注意即将付诸实施的苏联七年计划的史无前例的数字。这确是整个社会主义阵营对资本主义各国的挑战”。
    这家报纸指出，据这个新计划的规定，苏联的工业生产将增加80％、农业生产将增加70％。这些数字不是凭空的，因为它提供了具体的细节。
    社论特别追溯了苏联在农业方面的成就，并且说：“让我们也不要忘记，西伯利亚的辽阔土地早已不是流放之地而是苏联首先重视的一个地方，而且极有可能在短期间为人类目前的需要提供解决办法。这样就势必对亚非两洲的不发达国家形成一种吸引力，而美国所能提出的只是关于成就有限的科伦坡计划的许诺”。
    阿根廷“我们的话”周报11月27日以“苏联震动世界的七年计划”为题发表文章，评述苏联七年远景计划草案的重大意义。
    文章说：“在俄国社会主义革命的第二天，全世界的预言家们就叫嚷苏维埃国家连一年、一个月、一天都支持不了。”这种“悲剧性的预言不仅来自伦敦和纽约的俄国事务的‘专家’。那些不懂得或者不愿意懂得列宁主义关于帝国主义的理论和关于在一个国家可以实现社会主义的理论的假马克思主义者也唱着这个滥调。”
    文章接着说，但是苏联抵抗住了一天、一个月、一年的资本主义世界的经济和军事封锁、干涉战争和纳粹法西斯的进攻。在四十一年当中，苏联在生产发展速度上超过了一切国家，成了世界上第二个工业强国。
    文章强调指出，苏维埃国家不可抑制的力量打开了人类通向共产主义未来的大门。文章接着说，在完成国民经济七年远景计划时，苏联将在工业总产量和按人口平均的生产方面超过包括美国在内的一切资本主义国家。文章说，“这个新计划不是内阁研究的产物，而是人民创造力的表现。”
    文章介绍了苏联的七年远景计划草案在生产、生活水平的提高以及脑力和体力劳动相结合等方面将要取得的振奋人心的成就。文章接着说，“可以很容易地了解到，保持和平对于实现这些宏伟计划有多么重大的意义。争取和平的利益对于苏联并不只是一句话，而是它的本质的一部分。”文章指出，“非常明显，苏联在和平竞赛中将超过美国，超过整个资本主义。”
