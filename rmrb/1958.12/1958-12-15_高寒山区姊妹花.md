    Sisters of the High and Cold Mountains
    Fu Liancai

    There is an old mountain song in Changba Township, Jinsha County, Guizhou, which is still sung by the local people from time to time:

    Changba is high and cold, and the soil is barren,
    Planting and planting still fall short,
    Plant stems are big as incense sticks,
    The people's lives are hard to bear.

    Last autumn, Xie Yuanbi, a girl who had just graduated from elementary school, thought with dissatisfaction: "Is this mountain song still to be sung by our generation of young people? No, the horn of the Great Leap Forward has resounded throughout the country, and the Party has put forward the battle cry of 'hard work for three years to change the face of the mountainous area,' and educated us to 'be poor but have high aspirations.' I want to work with the people of the whole township to change the backwardness of our mountainous area."

    Soon, the county party committee held a youth symposium in the township, calling on everyone to march towards the technical revolution and actively promote new farm tools. Yuanbi took the lead in responding to the Party's call.

    Using the double-shared plow for the first time, Yuanbi's heart pounded. The plow was so heavy, and the ox was disobedient. When the ox ran forward, she followed; when the ox stopped, she had to stop. The onlookers laughed, and a feudal-minded person said, "It's a sin for a girl to plow the field!" Yuanbi's face turned red with anxiety. At this time, Xiong Hanwu, the director of the Five-Star Cooperative and a Communist Party member, came to teach her, and she gradually mastered the operation.

    In the evening, Yuanbi went home for dinner, and her younger sister Yuanfen, who was a year younger, pouted and said, "I can't learn if you are the only one going to learn!" Her mother was afraid that the two sisters would quarrel, so she agreed to let them go together.

    That night, they went to the field and worked under the light of a gasoline lamp. As soon as the younger sister saw the double-shared plow, she grabbed it to learn first, and said to her sister, "I want to plow better than you!" That night, both of them learned how to operate it. The next day, they learned to explain. Whatever the elder sister did, the younger sister would try to do it first. On the third day, they learned how to go up and down.

    After inspection, the soil they plowed was deep, even, and fine. Everyone agreed that the new plow was better than the old plow. Therefore, the fourteen double-shared plows that had been left in the ash heap were polished and taken out for use, and another two hundred and forty were newly purchased. Under their influence, more than five hundred women in the township became skilled in using new farm tools.

    However, the sisters were not satisfied with their achievements. When they heard that a girl was driving three double-shared plows at the same time, they said to the cooperative director, "If others can use them, we must use them too, and we must surpass her!" The cooperative director was very supportive and asked them to fetch oxen. Crossing several mountains, they came to Aunt Zhou's house to ask for oxen. Aunt Zhou said, "My oxen are in pain, you should go to the top of the slope to fetch them!" The people on the top of the slope gave them cows and weak oxen. Fortunately, the cooperative supported them and allocated twenty oxen from those raised by individual households for their use.

    They numbered the oxen and trained them slowly. They taught two first, then brought two more; after four were trained, they brought four more. But the position of the person was difficult to control. If they ran in front, the oxen behind would not come; if they ran behind, the oxen in front would not go. Finally, by standing in the middle, they were able to take care of the oxen in front and behind. When they encountered stones and turns, the oxen would automatically stop, waiting for the person to turn the plow before continuing. In this way, the elder sister was driving ten double-shared plows in a large field. Because the younger sister was still in school and had less time to practice, she only drove six double-shared plows.

    In February of this year, when the Party called for a tool reform movement, the sisters responded enthusiastically again. During work breaks, Yuanbi used chalk to draw tool designs on stones. When they returned home, the sisters studied together until late at night. The two also launched a competition.

    In just five or six days, the elder sister created seventeen kinds of tools, and the younger sister created seven kinds of tools. When people saw the two sisters competing and creating so many tools, they also took active action. The whole township contributed 3,600 suggestions and improved 186 kinds of tools, realizing local mechanization.

    In early April, at the county's technical innovation conference, the elder sister was named a special-class model of advanced technical innovation worker and gloriously joined the Communist Youth League. The masses composed a mountain song to praise them:

    Technical flowers bloom all over Changba,
    Leap Forward red flowers in the Xie family,
    Fenbi sisters compete greatly,
    Everyone praises each other for striving for the top.

    Later, the two sisters, together with eight other girls, formed a "Sisters Flower Group" and developed ten mu of high-yield fields, achieving ten aspects of work: early planting, deep plowing, fertilization, close planting, improvement, good seeds, technology, management, prevention, and meticulous care. They also studied diligently, and each learned one to two hundred kinds of farming techniques. At harvest time, this field, which used to yield only two hundred catties per mu, yielded more than 3,400 catties per mu, and the interplanted sweet potatoes could yield more than 15,000 catties.

    The old mountain songs are gone forever. The local people happily sing new mountain songs: High mountains can become treasure troves, plains can become rice granaries, plants can become money trees, barren soil satellites fly into the sky, with a fixed yield of ten thousand catties of grain per mu, and the whole land becomes a land of flowers and fruits. As long as we follow the Communist Party, a happy life will last forever.

    高寒山区姊妹花
    傅莲彩
    贵州金沙县长坝乡有一支旧山歌，还不时为当地人哼着：
    长坝高寒土瘦薄，
    种来种去差一合，
    植物秆秆香签大，
    人民生活难挨过。
    去年秋天，刚从小学毕业的姑娘谢远碧，很不满意地想：“难道这支山歌还要让我们这一代年轻人来唱吗？不能，大跃进的号角已经响遍全国，党向我们提出了‘苦战三年改变山区面貌’的战斗口号，教育我们要‘人穷志气高’，我要和全乡人民一起来改变我们山区的落后面貌。”
    不久，县委在乡里召开青年座谈会，号召大家向技术革命大进军，积极推广新式农具。远碧带头响应了党的号召。
    第一次使用双铧犁，远碧心里砰砰直跳。犁是那样的重，牛又不听话。牛往前跑，她就跟着往前跑；牛停下不走，她也只好停下来。看热闹的群众都笑起来，有个封建脑瓜说：“姑娘犁田有罪啊！”把远碧脸都急红了。这时，五星社主任、共产党员熊汉武跑来把着手教她，她才渐渐地掌握了操作。
    傍晚，远碧回家吃饭，小一岁的妹妹远芬翘起嘴巴说：“光是你一个人去学，我都得不到学！”妈妈怕两姊妹闹架，答应她们一同去。
    当晚她们就去到地里，挂起汽灯干。妹妹一见双铧犁就抢去先学，还对姐姐说：“我还要比你犁得更好！”这晚，两人都学会了操作。第二天，她们又学讲解。姐姐做哪样，妹妹都要抢着做。第三天，她们就学会了上、下。
    经过验收，她们犁的土又深、又平、又细，大家这才一致认为新式犁比旧式犁好。因此，放在灰堆里的十四部双铧犁又擦亮了，拿出来使用，另外还新买了二百四十部。在她们的影响下，全乡有五百多个妇女都成了新式农具手了。
    但是姊妹俩并不满足已有的成绩，当听说有个姑娘同时驾驶三部双铧犁的时候，她俩就对社主任说：“人家能使用，我们也要使用，而且要超过她！”社主任非常支持，叫她们去牵牛。翻过几座大山，她们来到周大娘家要牛。周大娘说：“我的牛痛，你们还是到坡顶上去牵吧！”坡顶上的人家拿母牛和弱牛给她们。好得社里支持她们，把分户喂养的牛，拨二十头给她们使用。
    她们把牛编起号数，慢慢训练。教会两头，再带两头；四头会了，再带四头。但是人的位置不好掌握，跑在前面，后面的牛不来；跑在后面，前面的牛又不走。最后，人站在中间，才把前后的牛都照顾了。遇到石头和转弯，牛就会自动地站起，等人转犁头后再走。就这样，在一块大土里，姐姐驾驶到十部双铧犁。妹妹因为还在学校读书，练习的时间少，所以只驾驶到六部双铧犁。
    今年2月，党号召开展工具改革运动，姊妹俩又热烈响应。做活休息的时候，远碧就用粉笔在石头上划来划去，绘制工具图样。回到家，姊妹俩一起研究到深夜。两人还展开了竞赛。
    只五、六天时间，姐姐创造了十七种工具，妹妹创造了七种工具。人们见俩姊妹竞赛，创造这么多工具，也积极行动起来。全乡共献计三千六百条，改良工具一百八十六种，实现了土机械化。
    4月初，在县召开的技术革新会上，姐姐被评为技术革新先进工作者特等模范，并光荣地参加了共青团。群众编山歌赞扬她们：
    技术花开满长坝，
    跃进红花在谢家，
    芬碧姊妹大竞赛，
    互争上游人人夸。
    后来，俩姊妹与八个姑娘一起，组成姊妹花小组，搞了十亩地的丰产坝，作到了早、深、肥、密、改、良、技、管、防、细十样功夫。她们又百般钻研，每人都学会了一百至二百多种耕作技术。秋收时，这片往年亩产只二百斤的地里，亩产达到了三千四百多斤，行行里套种的红苕还可以收一万五千多斤。
    旧的山歌一去不复返了，当地人民愉快地唱起新山歌：高山能变金宝库，平地能变米粮川，植物能变摇钱树，瘦土卫星飞上天，每亩定产万斤粮，遍地变成花果乡，只要跟着共产党，幸福生活万年长。
