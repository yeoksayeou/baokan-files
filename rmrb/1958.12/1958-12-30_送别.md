    Farewell
    Wen Bing
Packed his luggage and bundled up, the day to return to the city has arrived; the old man personally sees me off, two bundles of luggage on his shoulders! Walking out of the village and around the bend, a stretch of rice and grain fields ahead, Uncle! It was you who taught me to hold the plow, the grain flows with our sweat. Turning around to bow to the old man, thank you for teaching me to work; a year of tempering is really good, a heart dyed extraordinarily red! The old man turns his head and quickly replies: "Cadres and the masses are one family, wasn't it you who taught me to read, wasn't it you who called me Dad?"

    送别
    文丙裹起行李打起包，回城的日子转眼到；老大爷亲自把我送，两捆行李肩上挑！走出村子转过弯，前面一片米粮川，大爷！是你教我把犁扶，粮里流有咱们的汗。转身向大爷鞠个躬，谢谢你教会我劳动；一年的锻炼确实好，一颗心染的分外红！大爷转脸忙回答：“干部群众是一家，不是你教我把字认，不是你亲口喊过我爸爸？”
