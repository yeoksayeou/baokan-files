    Grain has had a bumper harvest, and the "marshal" of grain has already taken the lead. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries must also gallop forward and closely follow up, so that a comprehensive leap forward can be formed on the entire agricultural front. Only with the emergence of this situation can we further increase the supply of commodities to the state and the people, and increase the income of the communes. This is an urgent and major task facing the people's communes in various places.
    This task is urgent because there is also a matter of timing. All work should pay attention to seizing the opportunity, and agricultural production is even more so. Rural sideline production can be carried out all year round, but the period from the autumn harvest to the Lunar New Year is the peak season for the development of rural sideline occupations. After the autumn harvest this year, time has been delayed due to being busy with steelmaking and other work, but it is still not too late to start now. Grasping this season and engaging in diversified operations in a big way, the economic situation of the people's communes will surely improve significantly in two or three months. Conversely, if we hesitate and delay and do not vigorously engage in this work, we will miss this best opportunity. Party committees at all levels should vigorously promote this, so that the people's communes in various places will be full of energy, strive for the top, and quickly carry out and revitalize the comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    Whether the diversified operations of the people's communes can be quickly carried out and revitalized depends first and foremost on whether the Party committee makes great efforts to grasp this matter. This seems like a cliché, but it is actually a fundamental experience. Hasn't the great leap forward in production and construction over the past year vividly proved this point? The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" states: "...Just like on the industrial front, we must have a full-scale revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and completely change the face of the entire agricultural front." This refers to a "full-scale revolution" in the five industries, and a "complete change in the face of the entire agricultural front." Since the significance of the issue is so serious, how can it be achieved if the Party committee does not make great efforts to grasp it and the secretary does not take command? When the autumn harvest work was nearing its end, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee issued a call to vigorously develop diversified operations. Party committees at all levels made comprehensive arrangements for the labor force, divided the battle lines, and organized a force accounting for 20% to 30% of the total labor force to form a team to run diversified operations in a big way. Now, diversified operations in various parts of Sichuan have begun to show an active state.
    For the Party committee to grasp diversified operations, the most important thing is for the Party committee secretary to take command, and to immediately establish institutions to manage diversified operations to promote diverse economic activities. Sichuan Province has established specialized institutions for developing diversified operations at all levels from the special district, county, to the people's commune. Leading cadres plant "experimental plots" in diversified operations and participate in various aspects of production with the masses. This approach will undoubtedly vigorously promote the progress of diversified operations in the people's communes.
    To develop diversified operations, there must also be a positive and reliable plan. The resource conditions of each commune are different, and the labor, capital, technology, and specific needs are also different. Which production projects should be developed? Which should be developed first, and which should be developed later? Which should be developed in a big way, and which should be developed in a small way? Which should be managed uniformly by the commune, and which should be managed by the production brigade or production team? Which should be collectively managed, and which can be allowed to be managed by commune members' families in a decentralized manner? All these require leaders and the masses to discuss together, conduct investigations and discussions, and make practical and feasible plans, and then organize forces to carry them out separately.
    There is also an important condition for developing diversified operations, and that is the need for labor. Now, there have begun to be more favorable conditions in terms of labor. The task of steel production in various places has been victoriously completed, and some of the manpower that was drawn out to engage in steel production can be gradually transferred back. Some diversified production does not necessarily require strong labor and full labor (such as feeding pigs, raising chickens, weaving, collecting medicinal materials, etc., which can be done by the elderly, women, and children). As long as the leadership makes unified plans and comprehensive arrangements, the labor difficulties in developing diversified operations can be resolved. At the recent Standing Committee meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, attended by the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees, the province's water conservancy and manure accumulation tasks were re-arranged, and it was decided to draw 20% of the province's six million laborers (i.e., 1.2 million people) to immediately invest in various sideline production activities. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee has also decided to draw a portion of the labor force from the steel and water conservancy fronts and transfer them to various winter sideline production activities. These timely measures are of great significance for the rapid development of diversified operations.

### 快把多种经营活跃起来

    快把多种经营活跃起来
    粮食大丰收，粮食“元帅”已经一马当先了，林业、牧畜业、副业、渔业，也必须纵马奔驰，紧紧跟上去，这才能在全部农业战线上形成一个全面跃进的局面。只有这个局面的出现，才能进一步增加对国家和人民的商品供应，增加公社的收入。这是摆在各地人民公社面前的一个迫切的重大任务。
    这个任务之所以迫切，因为还有一个时机问题。任何工作都要注意抓时机，农业生产更是这样。农村的副业生产是长年都可以搞的，但从秋收以后到旧历春节这一段时间，是发展农村副业的旺季。今年秋收以后，忙于炼钢和其它工作，时间已耽误了一些，但从现在抓起，仍不为晚。抓紧这个季节，大搞多种经营，两三个月以后，人民公社的经济状况一定会有显著的改善。反之，如果迟疑拖延，不大力从事这项工作，就会错过这个最好的时机了。各级党委应当大力推动，使各地人民公社鼓足干劲，力争上游，赶快把农林牧副渔的综合经营开展起来，活跃起来。
    人民公社的多种经营能不能很快地开展起来，活跃起来，首先要看党委是不是下大力来抓这件事。这似乎是老生常谈，其实却是一条根本的经验。一年来的生产建设大跃进，不是生动地证明了这一点吗？“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中写道：“……如像在工业战线一样，一定要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。”这里说的是五业“全线大革命”，是“彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌”，问题的意义既是这样严重，党委不下大力来抓，书记不来挂帅，怎么成呢？中共四川省委在秋收工作接近尾声的时候，曾经发出大力发展多种经营的号召，各级党委对劳动力进行了全面安排，划分了战线，组织了占总劳动力的20％到30％的力量，组成大办多种经营的队伍，现在四川各地的多种经营已经开始呈现活跃的状态。
    党委抓多种经营，最重要的就要由党委书记挂帅，即时建立管理多种经营的机构，去推动多种经济的活动。四川省从专区、县到人民公社都层层建立了发展多种经营的专门机构。领导干部在多种经营中种“试验田”，同群众一起参加各种经营方面的生产。这种做法无疑会有力地推动人民公社多种经营的进展。
    发展多种经营，还须要有一个积极可靠的规划。各个公社的资源条件不同，劳力、资金、技术等条件和具体需要也各有差异，究竟发展哪些生产项目？哪些先发展，哪些后发展；哪些大发展，哪些小发展；哪些由公社统一经营，哪些由生产大队或生产小队经营；哪些应由集体经营，哪些可以允许社员家庭分散经营；诸如此类，都需要领导者和群众共同商议，经过调查和讨论，作出切实可行的规划，然后组织力量，分头进行。
    发展多种经营还要有一个重要的条件，这就是要有劳动力。现在，劳动力方面也开始有了比较有利的条件。各地的钢铁生产的任务已经胜利完成了，前些时抽出去从事钢铁生产的人力，有一部分可以陆续调回了。有些多种经营的生产，也不一定需要强劳动力和整劳动力（如喂猪、养鸡、编织、采集药材等工作，老人、妇女、小孩都可干）。只要领导方面统一规划，全面安排，发展多种经营的劳动力困难是可以解决的。中共江西省委在最近召开的有地、市委第一书记参加的常委会议上，重新安排了全省的水利和积肥任务，决定从全省六百万个劳动力中抽调20％（即一百二十万人），立即投入各种副业生产。中共河北省委也决定从钢铁和水利战线上抽出一部分劳动力转到各种冬季副业生产上来。这些及时的措施对于迅速发展多种经营都有重要意义。
