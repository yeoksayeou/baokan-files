Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Moscow dispatch. TASS is authorized to issue a statement on the attitude of Western countries towards the Soviet Union's proposal to make West Berlin a demilitarized free city. The full text is as follows:

Two weeks have passed since the Soviet government, in its notes to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, declared its decision to take measures to eliminate the foreign occupation regime in Berlin and put forward concrete proposals regarding ways to resolve the Berlin issue. The Soviet government's initiative has attracted widespread attention and has been supported by some countries and the broad public in many countries. People generally recognize more deeply that such a dangerous situation cannot continue, a situation in which West Berlin, occupied by Western countries' troops, poisons the situation in Europe, creates serious friction between countries, and keeps the German people in a constant state of tension and anxiety. Sober-minded people in all countries understand that the occupation regime in West Berlin has become the most dangerous malignant tumor in the heart of Europe, and if we do not want peace in Europe (and not only in Europe) to be threatened, we should resolutely remove this malignant tumor.

Whether Germans in the East or West, when evaluating the Soviet proposals, first noted that eliminating the absurd occupation of West Berlin would enable them to once again become masters of their historical capital, and at the same time, more favorable prerequisites would emerge for a peaceful rapprochement between the two Germanys. The government of one of these countries, the German Democratic Republic, firmly advocates ending the foreign occupation of Berlin and supports the proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

The Soviet proposal to make West Berlin a free city is generally considered fair because everyone is clear that the realization of this proposal will not cause losses to anyone, nor will it bring any unilateral benefits to anyone, not to mention the residents of West Berlin, because its realization will bring them considerable benefits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many newspapers of various colors in the West have emphasized the importance of the Soviet proposal on the Berlin issue, demanding that Western governments take this proposal seriously and hold negotiations with the Soviet Union.

However, it must be pointed out that official spokespersons of certain Western countries—participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—have adopted a completely different attitude towards the Soviet proposal on Berlin. This is very clear from the speeches of US President Eisenhower, US Secretary of State Dulles, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, and West German government head Chancellor Adenauer. TASS is authorized to issue the following statement regarding these speeches by the national leaders of Western countries:

Eisenhower and Dulles's Arguments Are Extremely Absurd
American Military Occupation of Berlin is What Threatens Peace and American Security

From the speeches of the US President and Secretary of State, the British Foreign Secretary, and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, one can only draw the conclusion that the governments of the above-mentioned countries are still unwilling to calmly assess the situation created in Europe by the existence of the West Berlin occupation regime. When they have to express their attitude towards the Soviet initiative, they still attempt to defend the Western countries' "rights" to occupy West Berlin, which have long ceased to exist, and are unwilling to seriously discuss the Soviet government's proposals.

The speeches of the spokespersons of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Federal Republic of Germany are a thorough attempt to obstruct the normalization of the Berlin situation and make every effort to preserve the foreign occupation of West Berlin. Another equally noteworthy characteristic of these speeches is that they do not regard West Berlin as a city where more than two million Germans live and work, but actually regard it as a pawn in the adventurous activities of the "Cold War" agitators, as an object in the military plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

President Eisenhower opposes the Soviet proposal. At a press conference on December 10, he said that the United States, Britain, and France "have a responsibility to safeguard the freedom of West Berlin." One must ask, who is infringing upon the "freedom" of West Berlin? Everyone knows that the Soviet government's proposal is not to disrupt the existing conditions of social life there. The Soviet Union does not want to gain anything for itself, nor does the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union does not want to harm the prestige of Western countries in the slightest. Not only that, but the Soviet government has also expressed its willingness to provide guarantees together with other countries to ensure that the status of the free city is observed and that the political and economic life of West Berlin is not interfered with. It seems that eliminating the occupation regime has turned into an infringement of the freedom of West Berlin, while maintaining this regime and the occupiers remaining in West Berlin is called defending freedom.

In his speech on December 4, US Secretary of State Dulles attempted to justify the presence of US troops in West Berlin with considerations of safeguarding peace and American "security." Needless to say, such arguments cannot be taken seriously, because it is difficult to find such a naive person who would believe that the American troops stationed in the heart of the German Democratic Republic are there to defend peace and American security. Everyone knows that no one has threatened the United States. On the contrary, it is precisely the US government's continued stationing of troops in West Berlin and maintaining this source of constant tension and a breeding ground for conflict and provocation in Germany that threatens peace, and thus also the security of the United States itself, because if things develop to the point of armed conflict, the presence of US troops in West Berlin probably won't bring any benefits.

Lloyd's Excuse of "Occupation Rights" is Untenable
US, British and French Occupation of Berlin Violates the Potsdam Agreement

British Foreign Secretary Mr. Lloyd has set himself an obviously unsolvable problem, attempting to find a "legal basis" for the control of West Berlin by foreign occupiers. He cannot deny the fact that the United States, Britain, and France have violated the Potsdam Agreement, and cannot find anything new, so he has to bring out the "unconditional surrender of Germany" and "occupation rights" as excuses again.

Today, nearly fourteen years after the end of the war, it is strange, if not absurd, to talk about so-called "occupation rights." May I ask: What basis does the British government have to believe that Germany, a sovereign country that has existed for nearly ten years, cannot live without occupiers and still needs the protection of occupiers? Are there any limits to these so-called "occupation rights"? How many more years do the occupiers want to use this so-called "right" as an excuse to stay in Berlin?

The British government certainly cannot be unaware that the presence of American, British, and French troops in West Berlin today has nothing in common with the occupation of Germany by the victorious powers in the early post-war period. The occupation of Germany in the early post-war period was agreed upon by the victorious powers after the crushing of the Hitlerite bandit gang, with very clear goals, which are expressly stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. These goals were: to completely disarm and demilitarize Germany, and to forever prevent the revival of German militarism and Nazism.

The Western three powers have turned West Berlin into a center for instigating propaganda and subversive activities against peace-loving countries, and have in fact turned it into a bridgehead for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bloc. Who can deny that this action directly tramples on the above-mentioned principles that once formed the basis for the four-power occupation of Germany? Obviously, in this situation, using "occupation rights" as an argument is a very brazen attempt to deceive the public, not to mention that these arguments are at least ten years out of date.

The purpose of the four-power occupation of Germany in those years was to restore peace and prevent new wars, while today the presence of American, British, and French troops in West Berlin is for the completely opposite purpose: to prepare for war, including preparing to launch a war against the country that was the main ally of the above-mentioned three countries in the anti-Hitler struggle.

Western Countries are Playing Old Tricks Again
Trying to Disrupt by Discussing the Entire German Question

In order to evade resolving the issue of normalizing the Berlin situation, the ruling groups of Western countries have once again used the old trick that they have repeatedly used to obstruct the resolution of important international issues, which is: to speculate on the issue of German reunification. They say that what the four powers should discuss is not the Berlin issue, but, as Lloyd recently said, "negotiations on the status of the entire Germany." Thus, they have reopened that old, hoarse talk of so-called "unifying Germany through free elections," a topic that even those who are usually patient enough to listen to British leaders speak are bored to sleep by. But who are the Western politicians trying to deceive by taking the notorious so-called four-power plan for negotiations on German reunification from the pile of junk that has long been abandoned by history? Everyone knows clearly that, as the Soviet government has repeatedly stated clearly for many years, it does not intend to help the three Western countries achieve their attempts to prevent the German people from resolving their most important national task. The Soviet Union will not participate in any negotiations aimed at replacing the Germans in resolving the issue of German reunification. Concluding and signing a peace treaty with Germany is another matter. The Soviet government has never denied the four powers' jurisdiction over this issue. The Soviet government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to participate in negotiations on drafting a peace treaty with Germany at any time.

If the proposition of using elections as a means of unifying Germany ever had any significance, then, under the current conditions, the demand to unify Germany through all-German elections has no realistic basis. Because Germany is currently divided into two parts due to the crimes of Western countries, and different social systems have been established in the East and West of Germany. One Germany, the German Democratic Republic, is developing along a path of peace and democracy, while the other Germany—the Federal Republic of Germany—has joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is actively pursuing a militaristic policy and a policy of preparing for atomic war. The above-mentioned demand is just an empty slogan with no content that is designed to win people over. Anyone who truly wants to unify Germany should promote the rapprochement and mutual understanding of the two Germanys. Unifying Germany is a matter for the two Germanys themselves, and no one has the right to impose their will on them or secretly squeeze them out when resolving this issue. In this way, and only in this way, can the German nation be unified into a unified country.

The Soviet Union Advocates Unifying Germany Through Peaceful and Democratic Means
The US, Britain, and France Are Striving to Deepen the Divide Between the Two Germanys

While the ruling groups of Western countries are pursuing a policy of striving to deepen the division of Germany, they are also attempting to deceive gullible people by stubbornly claiming that the Soviet Union is opposed to unifying Germany. But as long as one looks at the facts, one can see that this claim is extremely absurd. The Soviet Union has always advocated unifying Germany through peaceful and democratic means, and it now fully supports the only realistic program of reunifying Germany through negotiations between the two Germanys. The Soviet Union is willing to do everything possible to help overcome the contradictions between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and promote their gradual rapprochement. If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France also express their willingness to do so, then this would be the most appropriate way for them to help the German people resolve their national task—restoring national unity. But until now, these countries have not only not provided such assistance, but have been constantly and daily deepening the divide between the two Germanys.

The Western countries are doing everything possible to rely on the anti-democratic, militaristic system (under which the residents of West Germany have been living for a long time) to drag the entire Germany and the entire German people into the fatal adventurous plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. If any further proof is needed that such a plan exists, then it is enough to mention British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's speech on December 4. This speech blatantly hoped that "a unified Germany would be willing to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Mr. Lloyd even began to discuss what the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's troops should do after the entire Germany joined this aggressive military bloc: Should they remain on the West German territory where they are currently stationed? Or should they "advance another two hundred miles in the direction of Russia"?

According to the British Foreign Secretary, the Western countries intend to discuss their plan for a unified Germany not elsewhere, but in the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization! Doesn't this explain the problem? It seems that some leaders of Western countries are so idle that they are even considering such unrealistic, whimsical plans.

Resolving the German Issue Requires Recognizing Two Germanys
Talks Cannot Be Held Solely by the Four Powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France

Soviet leaders believe it is necessary to emphasize once again that any talks on the issue of unifying Germany by representatives of the four powers, namely the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, are impossible. There is only one basis for resolving the German issue—recognizing the existence of two Germanys, that is, recognizing the current reality of Germany.

The Soviet Union supports talks between national leaders, but both sides of the negotiations must have equal rights to discuss pressing international issues within their jurisdiction, and the discussion should take into account the legitimate interests of all parties. Such negotiations should help ease international tensions, rather than further heat up the international situation, and should not promote the "Cold War."

Those who are unwilling to ease tensions will certainly not like resolving international issues through negotiations. The same is true on the Berlin issue.

Adenauer is Doing Everything to Protect Foreign Occupation of Germany
Is Leading West Germany Onto a Disastrous Path of Adventure

Among the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, perhaps no one opposes the Soviet Union's proposal on the Berlin issue as frantically as the head of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer. The proposition that countries can resolve the Berlin issue through consultation, which is required by the interests of European peace and the guarantee of the legitimate rights of the German people, itself makes Prime Minister Adenauer unable to control himself. If he were allowed to do as he pleases, he would probably, regardless of everything, stir up the atmosphere surrounding the Berlin issue to white heat, in order to rekindle the flames of war in Germany. The Federal Chancellor is tugging at the coattails of Western countries, asking them to "maintain an absolutely firm attitude" towards the Soviet Union.

Everyone knows that the Federal Republic of Germany does not have, and cannot have, any rights to Berlin, which is hundreds of kilometers away from its borders. However, the head of the West German government, regardless of all this, said on December 5: "Berlin and the Federal Republic, the Federal Republic and Berlin are the same thing." Adenauer even went further: he brazenly proposed revising Germany's eastern borders and proclaimed that the ruling groups of the Federal Republic of Germany have "certain wishes" regarding this.

The Federal government head's reckless talks on the Soviet Union's proposal on the Berlin issue show that although Adenauer has been engaged in political activities for many years, he has not learned to draw lessons from history, which is something that national leaders should pay more attention to than anyone else. Adenauer's hatred of communism, which he demonstrates at every step, constantly pushes him onto the path taken by Hitler. But the adventurous path that he is trying to push West Germany onto is a dead end, and it can only lead West Germany to disaster.

The Federal Chancellor has gained the notoriety of being the main agitator of the European "Cold War." Whenever the Soviet Union or other socialist countries put forward some constructive proposal, Adenauer is always the first to say: "Oppose." Adenauer always repeats this tune whenever the Soviet Union puts forward proposals such as disarmament, drafting a peace treaty with Germany, and signing a non-aggression treaty. When the Soviet government put forward the proposal on the Berlin issue, he repeated this platitude again. In his talks on the Berlin issue, he stubbornly claimed that "Moscow has violated West Berlin." However, everyone is very clear that the Soviet Union's proposal on resolving the Berlin issue is precisely to eliminate any possibility of incorporating West Berlin into the sphere of influence of a certain country, or into the sphere of influence of a certain mutually hostile military bloc in Europe.

Adenauer said: The Soviet Union "should not threaten the people of other countries," but everyone knows clearly that the Soviet Union has not threatened anyone in the slightest, and all the proposals of the Soviet government on the Berlin issue are aimed at resolving this issue in a peaceful and sensible atmosphere, after calmly considering the interests of all parties.

What makes Adenauer uneasy is mainly that he is afraid that foreign troops will withdraw from West Berlin and return West Berlin to the Germans. His concern for the outdated rights of the occupiers of West Berlin is almost greater than that of the occupiers themselves. This situation is really puzzling! No wonder people say that Adenauer is the only German Chancellor in German history who uses his entire policy to protect the foreign occupation of Germany, a "Chancellor of Occupation."

The West German government does not need a Berlin of a peaceful Germany, but it has a keen interest in a West Berlin that is occupied by British, American, and French troops and has been turned into a base for subversive activities against socialist countries. Prime Minister Adenauer and those West Germans who support his policies are striving to maintain the West Berlin occupation regime, attempting to preserve this base in order to launch an aggression against the German Democratic Republic at an appropriate time and to launch a civil war in which Germans kill each other. But they cannot expect to maintain this springboard with their own strength, and therefore prefer to rely on the bayonets of the occupiers.

Judging from the attitude of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the occupation issue, its position on the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw all foreign troops from German territory can also be understood. The Bonn government resolutely opposes this proposal, and also opposes signing a peace treaty with Germany. According to all circumstances, the Bonn government has no desire to fully restore the sovereignty of the German people. It would rather have the residents of West Berlin, and even all the residents of their own country, endlessly subjected to spiritual humiliation and all the difficulties brought about by the occupation, than allow foreign troops to withdraw.

The Soviet Union is Determined to Eliminate the Abnormal Situation in Berlin
The West's Forcible Entry into Berlin Will be Countered

Can the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic turn a blind eye to West Berlin becoming not only a center for subversive activities against the member states of the Warsaw Treaty, but also a gathering place for troops hostile to these countries, and a base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? Obviously, every country that cares about its own security interests will not tolerate this situation. If anyone is still indifferent to this situation, then they are completely blind.

The Soviet government is firmly determined to take all necessary measures to eliminate the abnormal situation in Berlin. It hopes to abolish the Berlin occupation regime by conducting sensible consultations with other relevant countries. This is possible, and the Soviet government has not lost hope in this. If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are unwilling to cooperate with the Soviet Union to resolve this task, then the Soviet government has no other choice but to relinquish the responsibilities related to maintaining the Berlin occupation regime and conclude relevant agreements with the government of the German Democratic Republic.

Some people in the West are attempting to make threats. They are clamoring to use force and send tanks to maintain the status of the occupiers of West Berlin. What can be said about these clamors? These clamors are certainly not based on rational considerations. Any attempt to forcibly enter Berlin is tantamount to attacking the German Democratic Republic, which is also attacking its Warsaw Treaty allies. Isn't this very clear? It can be reminded that Soviet troops are stationed in East Germany, not to point out the road to Berlin to Western countries. If the German Democratic Republic is attacked, the member states of the Warsaw Treaty will work together to give the aggressor the response they deserve. The security of the German Democratic Republic will be reliably guaranteed.

Those who are mentally disturbed are clamoring to use force on the Berlin issue. Following these people means risking a war that would be a heavy disaster for humanity. Once a military conflict begins, it may not be limited to a certain limited scope, and both sides may use all the latest destructive weapons—all the way to the use of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. Is this not the goal that those who are shouting to drive tanks to Berlin want to achieve? If so, then they are consciously harboring cannibalistic intentions.

The Soviet proposal to abolish the occupied status of Berlin provides ample possibilities to resolve the West Berlin issue in a situation that is conducive to strengthening peace in Europe, does not cause losses to any major country, and is of great benefit to the German people. The Soviet people hope that the governments of Western countries will treat these proposals realistically and abandon everything that is being done today due to impulse, rather than due to calm consideration and a sober assessment of the situation.

    塔斯社发表关于柏林问题声明
    德国人必须当整个柏林的主人
    苏联有坚定决心取消柏林的占领制度
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯  塔斯社受权就西方国家对待苏联关于使西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议的态度发表声明。全文如下：
    自从苏联政府在给美国、英国和法国政府以及德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国政府的照会中宣告决定采取措施，消灭外国占领柏林制度，并且提出关于解决柏林问题途径的具体建议以来，已经过去两个星期了。苏联政府的倡议引起了普遍的注意，得到了一些国家以及很多国家广大公众的支持。人们普遍地更加深刻地认识到这样一种危险局面再不能继续下去了，这种局面就是：被西方国家军队占领的西柏林毒化着欧洲的局势，造成各国间的严重磨擦并且使德国人民经常处于紧张和忧虑的状态。各国头脑清醒的人都明白，西柏林的占领制度成为欧洲中部最危险的毒瘤，如果不愿欧洲（而且不仅仅是欧洲）的和平受到威胁的话，就应当坚决割除这个毒瘤。
    无论是德国东部或者是西部的德国人，在估价苏联的建议时，都首先注意到：消除对西柏林的荒谬的占领就能够使他们重新成为自己的历史的首都的主人，同时也会出现两个德国和平接近的更有利的先决条件。这两个国家之一——德意志民主共和国政府坚决主张结束外国对柏林的占领，并且支持关于把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议。
    苏联的关于使西柏林成为自由城市的建议被普遍认为是公正的，因为每个人都清楚，这个建议的实现不会给任何人带来损失，也不会给任何人带来任何单方面的利益，西柏林居民自不待言，因为实现这个建议会给他们带来不小的好处。因此，西方各种不同色彩的很多报刊都强调指出苏联关于柏林问题的建议的重要性，要求西方国家政府认真对待这个建议并且同苏联举行谈判，这是毫不奇怪的。
    但是，不能不指出，某些西方国家——北大西洋公约组织参加国的官方发言人对待苏联的关于柏林的建议采取完全另外一种态度。这一点，从美国总统艾森豪威尔、美国国务卿杜勒斯、英国外交大臣劳埃德和西德政府首脑阿登纳总理的言论中看得很清楚。塔斯社受权就西方国家的国家领导人的这些言论，发表声明如下：
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的论调十分荒谬
    美军占领柏林才威胁和平和美国安全
    从美国总统和国务卿、英国外交大臣和德意志联邦共和国总理的言论中，只能得出这样一个结论：上述国家的政府仍然不愿冷静地估计由于西柏林占领制度的存在而在欧洲造成的局势。他们在不得不对苏联的倡议表示态度的情况下，仍然企图为早已不复存在的西方国家占领西柏林的“权力”辩护，并且不愿认真讨论苏联政府的建议。
    美国、英国和德意志联邦共和国政府发言人的言论是彻头彻尾地企图阻挠柏林局势的正常化，千方百计地企图保存外国对西柏林的占领。这些言论的另一个同样值得注意的特点是，不把西柏林看作是一个有两百多万德国人生活和劳动着的城市，而是实际上把它看作是“冷战”鼓吹者冒险勾当中的一个走卒，看作是北大西洋公约组织军事计划中的一个对象。
    艾森豪威尔总统反对苏联的建议，他在12月10日的记者招待会上说，美、英、法三国“有职责维护柏林西部的自由”。那就要问，有谁侵犯西柏林的“自由”呢？大家知道，苏联政府的建议不是要破坏那里现存的社会生活条件。苏联并不想使自己得到任何东西，德意志民主共和国也是这样。苏联也不想丝毫损及西方国家的威信。不但如此，苏联政府还表示愿意同其他国家一道提供保证，使自由城市的地位得到遵守和使西柏林的政治和经济生活不受干涉。看来，消灭占领制度倒变成了对西柏林的自由的侵犯，而保留这种制度和占领者留在西柏林却被称为保卫自由。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在12月4日的讲话中企图用保障和平以及美国“安全”的考虑来为美军留在西柏林辩护。不用说，这种论据是不能被认真接受的，因为很难找出这样一种天真的人，他竟会相信美国人屯兵在德意志民主共和国的心脏是为了保卫和平和美国的安全。大家知道，任何人也没有威胁美国。相反，恰恰是美国政府继续屯兵在西柏林并且在德国保持这个不断产生紧张状态的根源和冲突、挑衅的策源地，才使和平，从而也就使美国本国的安全受到威胁，因为如果事情发展到武装冲突的地步，美军留驻在西柏林恐怕未必能得到什么好处。
    劳埃德“占领权力”的借口站不住脚
    美英法占领柏林已违反波茨坦协定
    英国外交大臣劳埃德先生给自己提出了显然无法解决的问题，企图为外国占领者控制西柏林寻找“法律基础”。他无法否认美国、英国和法国破坏波茨坦协定的事实，再也找不出任何新东西，只好重新拿出“德国无条件投降”和“占领权力”作为借口。
    在战争结束将近十四年的今天，高谈所谓“占领权力”，这如果不是荒谬的话，至少也是奇怪的。试问：英国政府有什么根据认为两个主权国家存在将近十年的德国没有占领者过不了日子和仍然需要占领者的保护呢？所谓“占领权力”究竟有界限没有？占领者还想要借口这种所谓“权力”在柏林再呆多少年呢？
    英国政府当然不会不知道，美国、英国和法国军队目前驻在西柏林，同战胜国在战后初期对德国的占领毫无共同之处。战后初期对德国的占领是战胜国在粉碎希特勒匪邦以后互相商定采取的，当时抱有十分明确的目标，这些目标在波茨坦协定中有明文规定。这些目标是：使德国完全裁军和非军事化，永远防止德国军国主义和纳粹主义的复活。
    西方三国把西柏林变成了对爱好和平的国家进行煽动宣传和颠复活动的中心，实际上把它变成了北大西洋公约组织军事集团的桥头堡。这种行动直接践踏了曾经是四国占领德国基础的上述原则，有谁能否认这一点呢？显然，在这种情况下拿“占领权力”作为论据，是十分厚颜无耻地企图迷惑公众，且不说这些论据至少已经过时十年了。
    当年四国占领德国的目的是为了恢复和平和防止新战争，而今天美国、英国和法国军队留在西柏林则是为了完全相反的目的：准备战争，其中包括准备对曾经是上述三国反希特勒斗争中主要盟友的国家发动战争。
    西方国家又搬出陈旧的老把戏
    想用讨论整个德国问题来捣乱
    西方国家统治集团为了逃避解决使柏林局势正常化的问题，再一次使用了他们为了阻挠解决重要的国际问题屡次使用过的老手段，这就是：在统一德国的问题上进行投机。他们说，四国应该讨论的不是柏林问题，而是像劳埃德最近所说的要举行关于“整个德国地位的谈判”。于是又打开了那陈旧的、嘶哑的所谓“通过自由选举统一德国”的话匣子，这种话匣子就连那些通常有耐心倾听英国领导人谈话的人也听得昏昏欲睡。可是，西方政客们从那些早就被历史抛弃的破烂货堆中搬出恶名昭著的所谓四国就德国统一问题举行谈判的计划，是想要欺骗谁呢？大家都清楚地知道，正如苏联政府许多年来一再明确声明的，它不打算帮助三个西方国家来达到它们的不让德国人民解决他们最重要的全民族任务的企图。苏联将不参加任何旨在代替德国人解决德国统一问题的谈判。制定和缔结对德和约，那是另外一回事。苏联政府从来不否认四国对这个问题的权限。苏联政府一再表示愿意随时参加制定对德和约的谈判。
    如果说，用选举作为统一德国的办法这一主张曾经有过意义的话，那么，在目前的条件下，想以全德选举的办法统一德国的要求是没有任何现实根据的。因为目前德国由于西方国家的罪过被分裂为两部分，在德国的东部和西部建立了不同的社会制度，一个德国，即德意志民主共和国正在沿着和平和民主的道路发展，而另一个德国——德意志联邦共和国已经参加了北大西洋公约组织并积极奉行军国主义政策和准备原子战争的政策。上面那个要求只是一个没有任何内容的笼络人心的空洞口号。谁要是真正想使德国统一，他就应该促进两个德国的接近和相互了解。统一德国，这是两个德国自己的事情，任何人也无权把自己的意旨强加在它们的身上或者在解决这个问题的时候把它们偷偷挤掉。用上面这种办法，也只有用这种办法，才能把德意志民族统一成一个统一的国家。
    苏联主张通过和平民主途径统一德国
    美英法却在竭力加深两个德国的鸿沟
    西方国家统治集团一方面奉行竭力加深德国分裂的政策，另一方面又企图欺骗轻信的人，硬说，苏联反对统一德国。但是只要看一看事实，就可以看出这种说法是十分荒谬的了。苏联始终主张通过和平和民主的途径统一德国，它现在完全支持通过两个德国的协商重新统一德国这个唯一现实的纲领。苏联愿意尽一切努力帮助克服德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间的矛盾和促进它们之间逐渐接近。如果美国、英国和法国政府也表示愿意这样做，那末，这就是它们最恰当地帮助了德国人民去解决自己的民族任务——恢复国家统一。但是，直到现在为止，这些国家不但没有作这种帮助，反而经常地、每天都在加深两个德国之间的鸿沟。
    西方国家竭尽一切力量，想依靠反民主的、军国主义的制度（西德居民已经在这种制度下生活了很久）来把整个德国和全德人民拖进北大西洋公约组织的致命的冒险计划。如果需要再拿什么来证明有这种计划存在的话，那末，只要提一下英国外交大臣12月4日的演说就足够了。这次演说露骨地指望“统一的德国会愿意加入北大西洋公约组织”。劳埃德先生甚至开始议论整个德国加入北大西洋公约组织这个侵略性的军事集团之后，北大西洋公约组织的军队该怎么办才好：是留在它们现在驻扎的西德领土上好呢？还是“朝俄国的方向再往前推进二百英里”好。
    据英国外交大臣说，西方国家打算不是在别的什么地方，而是在北大西洋公约组织理事会上讨论它们的统一德国计划！这难道还不说明问题吗？看来，西方的某些国家领导人是闲得发慌，竟考虑起这种脱离实际生活的想入非非的计划来了。
    解决德国问题必须承认两个德国
    不能单由苏美英法四国举行会谈
    苏联领导人认为有必要再次强调指出，由四国，即苏联、美国、英国和法国代表来进行关于统一德国的问题的任何会谈都是不可能的。解决德国问题只有一个基础——承认两个德国的存在即承认德国当前的实际情况。
    苏联赞成各国领导人会谈，但是谈判双方必须有平等权利来讨论属于它们权限内的迫切的国际问题，讨论时应考虑各方面的合法利益。这种谈判应当有助于缓和国际紧张局势，而不是为了使国际局势进一步热化，不是为了鼓吹“冷战”。
    不愿意缓和紧张局势的人，当然不会喜欢通过谈判来解决国际问题。在柏林问题上也是一样。
    阿登纳全力保护外国对德国占领
    正把西德引向灾难性的冒险道路
    北大西洋公约组织国家的领导人中，也许没有哪一个人像德意志联邦共和国政府首脑阿登纳这样疯狂地反对苏联关于柏林问题的建议。关于各国能够协商解决柏林问题的主张是欧洲和平的利益以及保证德国人民合法权利所要求的，这种主张本身就使得阿登纳总理控制不了自己。如果让他为所欲为的话，他大概会不顾一切地围绕着柏林问题把气氛搞得白热化，以便在德国重新燃起战火。联邦总理拉着西方国家礼服的后襟，请求他们对苏联“保持绝对坚定的态度”。
    大家知道，德意志联邦共和国根本没有，也不可能有对离它的边境数百公里的柏林具有任何权利。但是，西德政府首脑竟不顾这一切，在12月5日说：“柏林和联邦共和国，联邦共和国和柏林是一回事”。阿登纳还走得更远：他竟恬不知耻地提出修改德国的东部边界问题，并且宣扬德意志联邦共和国统治集团对这一点有“一定的愿望”。
    联邦政府首脑对苏联关于柏林问题的建议发表的肆无忌惮的谈话说明，阿登纳虽然从事过多年的政治活动，但是远没有学会从历史中取得教训，而这一点对国家领导人来说是比任何其他人都更应该注意的。阿登纳在每一个步骤上表现出来的对共产主义的仇恨时时把他推上希特勒走过的道路。但是，企图把西德推上去的冒险道路是一条绝路，它只能把西德引向灾难。
    联邦总理获得了欧洲“冷战”的主要鼓吹者的臭名。只要苏联或其他社会主义国家提出某种建设性的建议，阿登纳总是一马当先地说：“反对”。每当苏联提出裁军、制定对德和约和签订互不侵犯条约等建议时，阿登纳总是重复这种调子。当苏联政府提出柏林问题的建议时，他又重复这个滥调。他在关于柏林问题的谈话中硬说“莫斯科侵犯了西柏林”。虽然，大家都很清楚，苏联关于解决柏林问题的建议恰恰是要消除把西柏林纳入某一个国家的势力范围，纳入欧洲某一个相互敌对的军事集团的势力范围的任何可能性。
    阿登纳说：苏联“不应该威胁其他国家的人民”，然而大家都清楚地知道，苏联对任何人也没有丝毫的威胁，苏联政府关于柏林问题的一切建议都是为了在冷静考虑各方面利益的情况下，在和平明智的气氛中来解决这个问题。
    使阿登纳不安的主要是，他生怕外国军队会撤出西柏林并把西柏林交还给德国人。他对西柏林占领者的过了时的权利的关心程度几乎要超过占领者本身。这种情况实在令人不解！难怪人们说，阿登纳是德国历史上唯一用自己的全部政策来保护外国对德国的占领的德国总理，是一位“占领总理”。
    西德政府不需要一个和平的德国人的柏林，但它对一个由英、美、法军队占领并变成对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的基地的西柏林的兴趣却很浓厚。阿登纳总理和那些支持他的政策的西德人士力争维持西柏林占领制度，企图保留这个基地以便在适当的时机对德意志民主共和国进行侵略，发动德国人互相残杀的内战。但是他们不能指望以自己的力量来保持西柏林这块跳板，因而宁愿依赖占领者的刺刀。
    从德意志联邦共和国政府这种对待占领问题的态度看来，它对苏联关于从德国领土上撤出一切外国军队的建议所持的立场也就可以理解了。波恩政府断然反对这个建议，也反对签订对德和约。根据一切情况判断，波恩政府毫无完全恢复德国人民主权的愿望。宁可让西柏林居民乃至于自己国家的全体居民无止境地受到精神上的屈辱和占领带来的一切困难，也不让外国军队撤退。
    苏联决心消除柏林不正常状况
    西方用武力冲进柏林将遭反击
    难道苏联和德意志民主共和国能够熟视无睹地让西柏林不仅变成对华沙条约成员国进行颠复活动的中心，而且变成敌视这些国家的军队的结集地，变成北大西洋公约组织的基地吗？很明显，每一个关心本身安全利益的国家都不会容忍这种状况。如果有谁在这种情况下还漫不在乎，那就是十足的瞎子。
    苏联政府有坚定的决心采取为了消除柏林的不正常状况所需要的一切措施。它希望取消柏林占领制度，办法是同其他有关国家进行明智的协商，这样做是可能的，苏联政府对这些没有失去希望。如果美国、英国和法国政府不愿意同苏联合作来解决这个任务，那么，苏联政府没有别的办法，只好卸去与维持柏林占领制度有关的职责，并同德意志民主共和国政府缔结有关协定。
    西方有人企图进行威胁。他们叫嚣使用武力，出动坦克来维护西柏林占领者的地位。对这些叫嚣有什么可说的呢？这种叫嚣绝不是出于理智的考虑。想依靠武力冲进柏林的任何企图就等于是进攻德意志民主共和国，也就是进攻它的华沙条约盟国，这一点不是很清楚的吗？可以提醒一下，苏联军队驻在东德，并不是为了给西方国家指出通向柏林的道路。如果德意志民主共和国受到进攻，华沙条约成员国就要协力给侵略者以应有的反击。德意志民主共和国的安全将得到可靠的保障。
    那些神经失常的人叫嚣要在柏林问题上使用武力，跟着这些人走，就意味着会引起对人类有沉重灾难的战争的危险。一旦军事冲突开始，未必能把它限制在某种有限的范围内，双方可能会使用一切最新的毁灭性武器——一直到使用核武器和火箭武器。那些叫嚷把坦克开到柏林去的人所要达到的目的不就是这样吗？如果是这样的话，那末他们就是有意识地抱着吃人的目的。
    苏联关于取消柏林占领地位的建议提供了充分的可能性来使西柏林问题在下述情况下得到解决，即有利于加强欧洲和平，不使任何大国遭受损失，而对德国人民都有莫大的好处。苏联人希望西方国家政府实事求是地对待这些建议，放弃今天由于冲动、而不是由于冷静的考虑和对局势的清醒估计而作出的一切。
