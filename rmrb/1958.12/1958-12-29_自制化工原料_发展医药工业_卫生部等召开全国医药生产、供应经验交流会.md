Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 28th. The Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Health convened a National Experience Exchange Conference on Pharmaceutical Production, Supply, and Technological Revolution in Shanghai in mid-December. The conference discussed the current national pharmaceutical production and supply situation and determined the production policy for the pharmaceutical industry: combining indigenous and foreign methods, relying on self-reliance, vigorously developing pharmaceutical raw materials, launching a major technological revolution, and starting with basic chemical raw materials to increase pharmaceutical production and ensure the needs of the great leap forward in healthcare.

The conference believed that the achievements of the national pharmaceutical industry this year are significant. Taking Shanghai, which accounts for 40% of the national pharmaceutical industrial output value, as an example, the output value from January to November this year increased by 85% compared to the same period last year, and more than 500 new products were trial-produced, with more than 200 already put into production. It is estimated that the national pharmaceutical industry can produce more than 800 varieties of drugs.

The conference believes that the main problem currently facing the pharmaceutical industry is that the supply of basic chemical raw materials is insufficient, and the increase in the quantity of medicines cannot meet the needs. With the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, the elimination of the four pests, the emphasis on hygiene, and the development of disease eradication movements, the demand for both traditional Chinese and Western medicines is generally increasing; especially after the national rural collectivization, hospitals, health stations and other medical institutions have been widely established, and the demand for medicines is growing even faster.

The conference believes that to solve the above contradictions, the pharmaceutical industry must learn to walk on two legs, launch a vigorous mass movement, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously develop pharmaceutical raw materials, especially basic chemical raw materials. From raw materials to finished products, pharmaceutical factories must rely on their own efforts, and research departments must also combine with actual needs and use small indigenous groups for production. At present, the national pharmaceutical industry has more than 60,000 employees and more than 200 factories. If every factory produces chemical raw materials and everyone produces chemical raw materials, accumulating small amounts will greatly increase the output. The conference also proposed that to develop the pharmaceutical industry, it is necessary to rely on the leadership of party committees at all levels and give appropriate arrangements for various urgently needed pharmaceutical chemical raw materials and steel materials required for manufacturing medical equipment. All localities should also pay attention to the production, cultivation, and purchase of Chinese medicinal materials, and seize the current season for collecting medicinal materials to actively arrange purchases.

    自制化工原料  发展医药工业
    卫生部等召开全国医药生产、供应经验交流会
    据新华社上海28日电  化学工业部、商业部和卫生部12月中旬在上海召开全国医药生产、供应、技术革命经验交流大会，讨论当前全国药品的生产和供应情况，确定了医药工业的生产方针：土洋结合，自力更生，大搞制药原料，大闹技术革命，并从基本化工原料着手，增加药品的生产，保证医疗卫生事业大跃进的需要。
    会议认为，今年全国医药工业的成就是显著的。以占全国医药工业产值40％的上海为例，今年1月到11月的产值就比去年同期增长了85％，试制成五百多种新产品，已有二百多种投入生产。全国医药工业的品种预计可以达到八百多种。
    会议认为，医药工业当前的主要问题是：化工基本原料供应不足药品的增长数量，不能适应需要。全国工农业生产大跃进，除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动的开展，中西药品的需要正在普遍增长；特别是全国农村公社化以后，普遍建立了医院、保健站等医疗机构，药品的需求增长更快。
    会议认为要解决上述矛盾，医药工业必须学会两条腿走路，大闹群众运动，土洋并举，大搞制药原料，特别是化工基本原料。从原料起直到成品，药厂要自力更生，研究部门也要结合实际需要，用小土群的方法进行生产。全国医药工业目前有六万多职工，两百多个工厂，厂厂搞化工原料，人人搞化工原料，积少成多，产量就会大大增加。大会同时提出要发展医药工业，必须依靠各级党委的领导，对各种亟需的药品化工原料，和制造医药器材需用的钢材等，给予适当的安排。各地还应该注意生产培植和收买中药材，抓紧目前药材收集季节积极安排收购。
