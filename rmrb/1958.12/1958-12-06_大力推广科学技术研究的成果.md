Scientific and technological research achievements are the property of all the people, and should become a powerful weapon for all the people in their struggle against nature. The contribution of scientific and technological research to the cause of socialism is measured not only by its academic value, but also by the extent to which research results are promoted. Scientific and technological research achievements are an important factor in the development of social productivity. The industrial revolution in 18th-century Europe was triggered by the invention of the steam engine. The current technological revolution in our country is also due to the development of scientific and technological research and the promotion of its achievements. The importance of a scientific and technological achievement depends on its significant impact on the technological revolution and the development of productivity. If we want science and technology to catch up with the advanced world level, it means that those scientific and technological achievements that have reached the advanced world level must also be promoted and applied in production. Therefore, promoting the achievements of scientific and technological research is an extremely important task in scientific work, and also an extremely important task in our socialist construction.

In capitalist society, the achievements created by the wisdom of scientific and technological workers are only possessed by a small number of capitalists. At the same time, science and labor are opposed to each other. The promotion of every scientific and technological research achievement only benefits the exploiting class and becomes a weapon for the exploiting class to further exploit the working people. Many scientific and technological workers do not care about the promotion of research results at all. However, today, in our socialist country, science and technology serve the people, and any scientific and technological research achievement is beneficial to the working people. The people enthusiastically demand the promotion of scientific and technological achievements to reduce heavy labor and promote the great leap forward in production. In this way, there are extremely favorable conditions for promoting scientific and technological research achievements. The great leap forward in China's socialist construction has seen the emergence of a large number of scientific and technological inventions and creations, but at the same time, people are far from satisfied with the current achievements. There are not too many scientific and technological research achievements, but too few; the promotion of research achievements is not too fast, but too slow. Agricultural production experts constantly propose to agricultural scientists: "We hope you will do research quickly, and immediately promote it as soon as you come up with it." Under such circumstances, we should quickly do a good job in promoting the existing research results.

Furthermore, social production practice can enrich and revise existing scientific and technological research achievements. A scientific research is only successful in a small laboratory, and the research work can only be considered half completed without the test of practice. Many scientific and technological achievements are gradually perfected in the process of promotion, and new topics are generated in the process of promotion, which promotes the further development of scientific and technological research. Our scientific cause should be to improve, popularize, and then improve, and then popularize, and move forward repeatedly. Therefore, for the development of science itself, we should also strive to promote research results.

At present, whether it is scientific research institutions, universities, or the masses of workers and peasants, unprecedented achievements have been made in scientific research. Many research results that have reached or exceeded the world level have emerged, many world-first achievements have emerged, and a large number of research projects aimed at the actual needs of production have been completed. Some of them have been applied to production and have played a great role in promoting the development of productive forces. However, a large part of it is still in the laboratory stage, or only samples have been made, and has not been widely promoted and applied. Many inventions and creations of the masses are only used in one region or one department, and have not been exchanged and promoted in time. People criticize that "one invention, two newspapers, three exhibitions, and four finished." The phenomenon of only paying attention to inventions and creations but not paying attention to promotion, as well as the phenomenon of only burying oneself in research and not paying attention to absorbing other people's advanced experiences, is still quite common. This is not in line with the requirements of socialist construction. This phenomenon should be reversed immediately, and the promotion of scientific and technological research achievements should be done well. Our slogan is: Everyone is responsible for promoting scientific and technological achievements.

The promotion of scientific and technological research achievements must first be valued by the leading organs of scientific research. It is wrong to only care about research and not care about promotion, and to regard promotion as dispensable. At present, many leading organs of scientific research have begun to pay attention to promotion work. Some consider how to promote it when formulating research plans; some not only pay attention to the quality of research results, but also pay great attention to economic effects, and try to consider using materials that are easy to obtain and relatively cheap, and even use waste products for refitting, and implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods; some have already carried out some good promotion activities. Facts have proved that as long as the leading organs of scientific research attach importance to it, the promotion work will make good progress. Artificial weather control work is a good example. With the preliminary results of this work, the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Meteorological Bureau, the Air Force Department, universities and other units cooperated extensively to actively promote and test these preliminary results, and opened training courses specifically for promotion, and sent staff to establish experimental base points in various places, serving the actual production and continuing to experiment and research. They did a good job. For example, in order to promote the "four no need" construction new technology successfully researched by the Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture, the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently jointly held an on-site meeting in Harbin with the Ministry of Construction Engineering, with representatives from 26 provinces and cities across the country participating, to promote it. These promotional activities are necessary.

In the promotion of scientific and technological research achievements, we must seek truth from facts. What standard a research achievement reaches is what standard it is, and no exaggeration is allowed. If a research achievement has not reached the required standard, but exaggerates the publicity and forces promotion, it will cause losses to the actual work. Therefore, scientific and technological research must attach great importance to testing and inspection, and must never allow mystification. If a research has indeed achieved success, the production department should applaud and welcome it, assist in the experiment or promotion, and any cold and conservative attitude such as "fear of trouble" and "fear of disrupting the original plan" is also wrong, which will affect the better development of production. At the same time, it should be seen that some scientific research departments are limited by equipment and can only obtain results in the laboratory. If it is required to obtain verification in the natural environment or become formal products, it is necessary to go through the intermediate test stage. Production departments should assist in solving the scientific research departments that do not have these intermediate test equipment. Production departments and scientific research departments should fully cooperate and try every means to promote the achievements of scientific and technological research in production.

Promotion work should be an important task for every scientific and technological worker. Bourgeois ideology has a great influence in the scientific community. Starting from personal fame and fortune, starting from personal interests, one will ignore the actual needs of production. These poisons are being cleared. The bourgeois scientific research viewpoint is also manifested in the promotion work. Some people think that the research work is completed as long as the data is obtained and the paper is written, as for whether to promote it or not, and whether it can be promoted or not, it is someone else's business. Some people, in order to make the research work "ahead," have grasped other topics after a preliminary result has been made in a research; their preliminary results can only be shelved. These ideas should be changed. Scientific and technological workers should regard the promotion of research achievements as a part of their research work. At present, some good practices are constantly emerging in scientific and technological work, such as when considering research topics, they prepare that their research is to solve a certain problem for steel, for food, or for people's communes. Therefore, it is easy to promote after the research is completed. Some scientific workers immediately write popular booklets to introduce and promote after completing a research work; some personally give lectures in promotion training classes, or go to the production site to help promote and apply.

From the promotion of many research achievements, it can be seen that the importance attached by the local party and government leading organs is an important link in doing a good job in promotion. For example, party and government leaders in Jilin, Gansu and other places personally took charge and directly led the promotion of artificial weather control, so this promotion work achieved relatively good results in a very short time. We must dare to accept new things, do everything possible to support the experiment and promotion of scientific and technological research achievements, and can further put forward research topics and assist in the promotion requirements to scientific research institutions based on the needs of production. This is beneficial to production and also promotes scientific work.

To do a good job in promotion, we should also mobilize the masses. At the same time, this is also a matter related to the popularization and improvement of scientific research. Scientific and technological research has been improved, it should be quickly popularized among the broad masses of workers and peasants, so that scientific research achievements can be mastered by the masses. Some research achievements have little or no conflict with the production experience and habits of the masses, and are relatively easy to promote. To promote some research achievements, it is necessary to break the production habits that the masses have followed for many years, and even involve superstitious ideas, which will inevitably encounter resistance. We should fully do a good job in the promotion and publicity work, make examples on the spot, and let the masses see that the application of scientific and technological research achievements is only good for production and not harmful, and only good for people's lives and not harmful. Once the masses are mobilized, not only can the achievements of scientific and technological research be promoted, but also scientific and technological achievements will be enriched or developed. The masses not only become popularizers, but also become improvers, and in turn promote the progress of science and technology.

With inventions and creations, they should be promoted and applied. In the great leap forward in China's scientific cause, scientific and technological research achievements will emerge in greater quantities. Each region, each department, each scientific research institution, and every scientific and technological worker has an unshirkable responsibility to make the most active efforts to quickly promote and apply various research achievements, so that China's socialist construction can leap forward at a more robust pace.

### 大力推广科学技术研究的成果

    大力推广科学技术研究的成果
    科学技术研究成果是全体人民的财产，它应该成为全体人民向自然作斗争的有力武器。衡量科学技术研究工作对社会主义事业所作的贡献是大是小，不只决定于它的学术价值，同时也取决于研究成果推广的程度。科学技术研究成果是社会生产力发展的重要因素。欧洲十八世纪的产业革命，就是由于蒸汽机的发明而开始引起的。当前我国的技术革命也就是科学技术研究的发展及其成果的推广。某一项科学技术成就的重要程度，取决于它对技术革命、对生产力的发展的重大影响。如果我们要求科学技术赶上世界先进水平，那就意味着生产上也要推广应用了那些达到世界先进水平的科学技术成就。所以推广科学技术研究成果，是科学工作中一项极为重要的任务，也是我们社会主义建设事业中一项极为重要的任务。
    在资本主义社会，科学技术工作者们的全部智慧所创造的成果，只为一小部分资本家所占有。同时，科学与劳动是对立的。每一项科学技术研究成果的推广只有利于剥削阶级，成为剥削阶级进一步剥削劳动人民的武器。许多科学技术工作者，根本不去过问研究成果的推广的问题。但是，今天，在我们社会主义国家里，科学技术是为人民群众服务的，任何科学技术研究的成果都有利于劳动人民。人民热烈地要求推广科学技术成就，以减轻繁重的劳动，和促进生产大跃进。这样，推广科学技术研究成果，就有了极为有利的条件。我国社会主义建设事业大跃进涌现了大量的科学技术发明创造，但同时，人们却远不能满足当前的成果。科学技术研究成果不是太多而是太少了，研究成果的推广不是太快而是太慢了。农业生产能手们见到农业科学家时不断地提出：“希望你们快研究，研究出来就马上推广”。在这样的形势下，我们应当迅速地做好已有的研究成果的推广工作。
    再者，社会生产实践可以丰富和修正已有的科学技术研究成果。一项科学研究只在小实验室里取得成功，未经实践的考验，这样的研究工作只能算完成了一半。许多科学技术成就是在推广中逐渐臻于完善，而在推广中又产生了新的课题，促使科学技术研究进一步发展。我们的科学事业应该是提高、普及，再提高，再普及，不断地反复地前进。所以就科学本身的发展来说，也应该努力于研究成果的推广。
    目前，无论是科学研究机关、大中学校或工农群众在科学研究上都是成绩空前，许多达到或超过世界水平的研究成果出现了，许多世界首创的成就出现了，大量针对生产实际要求而进行的研究项目完成了。其中一部分已经应用到生产中去，并且已经起了很大的作用，促进了生产力的发展。但是还有很大一部分停留在实验室的阶段，或者只做出样品，没有广泛地推广应用。群众的许多发明创造，有的只是用在一个地区或一个部门，没有及时交流和推广。人们批评说：“一发明，二登报，三展览，四完了。”只重视发明创造、不重视推广的现象，以及只埋头钻研、不重视吸取别人的先进经验的现象，还相当普遍。这是不合乎社会主义建设事业的要求的。应该立即扭转这种现象，做好科学技术研究成果的推广工作。我们的口号是：推广科学技术成就，人人都有责任。
    科学技术研究成果的推广，首先要科学研究领导机关重视。只管研究不管推广、把推广工作看作可有可无的作法是不对的。目前，许多科学研究领导机关已经开始重视推广工作，有的在制订研究计划的时候，就考虑到将如何推广；有的不仅注意研究成果的质量，而且很注意经济效果，尽量考虑使用容易得到而又比较便宜的材料，甚至利用废旧物品改装，贯彻土洋并举的方针；有的已经进行了一些很好的推广活动。事实证明，只要科学研究领导机关重视，推广工作就会得到很好的进展。人工控制天气工作就是一个很好的例子。这项工作有了初步成果，中国科学院地球物理研究所、中央气象局、空军部门、高等学校等单位就大协作，积极推广试验这初步成果，开办了专为推广的训练班，派工作人员到各地建立试验基点，一面为生产实际服务，一面继续试验研究。他们做得好。又如中国科学院为了推广土木建筑研究所研究成功的“四不用”建筑新技术，最近同建筑工程部在哈尔滨市联合召开了有全国二十六个省市代表参加的现场会议，予以推广。这些推广活动都是必要的。
    在科学技术研究成果的推广工作中，必须实事求是。一项研究成果达到什么标准就是什么标准，不容许有丝毫虚夸。如果一项研究成果还没有达到所要求的标准，而夸大宣传，强求推广，这就会使实际工作遭受损失。所以科学技术研究必须十分重视测试、检验，绝不许可玩弄玄虚。一项研究确实有了成就，生产部门应当拍手欢迎，协助实验或推广，任何“怕麻烦”，“怕打乱原来计划”等等冷冰冰的保守态度，也都是不对的，这会影响生产的更好发展。同时，应当看到有一些科学研究部门限于设备，只能得到实验室内的成果，如果要求得到自然环境中的验证或者变成正式生产品，还需要经过中间试验阶段，没有这些中间试验设备的科学研究部门，生产部门就应当协助解决。生产部门同科学研究部门要充分协作，想尽一切办法把科学技术研究的成果在生产中推广。
    推广工作应该是每一个科学技术工作者的重要任务。资产阶级思想在科学界有很大的影响。从个人名利出发、从个人的兴趣出发，就会不顾生产实际的要求。这些毒害正在被清除。资产阶级的科学研究观点也表现在推广工作中。有人认为研究工作只要得出数据、写出论文就算完成任务，至于要不要推广，能不能推广，则是别人的事。有的人为了使研究工作“走在前头”，一项研究做出了初步成果，就又抓其他的题目去了；他们的初步成果就只好束之高阁。这些想法都应该加以改变。科学技术工作者应该把研究成果的推广，看作是自己研究工作的一个部分。目前在科学技术工作中不断出现一些好的做法，如在考虑研究课题时，就准备自己的研究是为钢铁、为粮食或为人民公社解决某个问题的。因而研究完成以后很容易推广。有的科学工作者完成了一项研究工作以后，立即写成通俗的小册子介绍推广；有的亲自到推广训练班讲课，或到生产现场去帮助推广应用。
    从许多研究成果的推广工作中可以看到，地方党政领导机关的重视，是做好推广工作的重要一环。如吉林、甘肃等地党政领导人员亲自挂帅，直接领导人工控制天气的推广工作，因而这项推广工作在很短时间就获得了比较好的效果。我们要勇于接受新鲜事物，尽一切力量支持科学技术研究成果的试验和推广，而且可以进一步从生产的需要出发，给科学研究机关提出研究课题和协助推广的要求。这对生产有利，对科学工作也起了促进的作用。
    要做好推广工作，还应该发动群众。同时这也是一个关系到科学研究的普及与提高的问题。科学技术研究有了提高，就应该迅速在广大工农群众中加以普及，使科学研究成果为群众所掌握。有的研究成果，同群众的生产经验、习惯等没有抵触或很少抵触，推广比较容易。有的研究成果要推广，就得破除群众多少年来相沿的生产习惯，甚至涉及到迷信思想，这就必然会遇到阻力。应该充分地做好推广的宣传工作，实地做出榜样，让群众看到科学技术研究成果的应用，对生产只有好处没有坏处，对人们的生活也只有好处没有坏处。一旦群众发动起来，不但科学技术的研究成果可以得到推广，科学技术成就也会更加丰富或得到发展。群众不仅成了普及者，也成了提高者，反过来推动科学技术的进展。
    有发明创造，就要推广应用。在我国科学事业的大跃进中，科学技术研究成果将更大量地涌现，各地区、各部门、各科学研究机关，每一个科学技术工作者，责无旁贷，都应该作最积极的努力，使各项研究成果迅速地推广应用，从而使我国的社会主义建设事业以更健壮的步伐跃进。
