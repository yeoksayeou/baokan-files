    One Telex Machine: Sends Messages and Keeps a Record
    The Qingdao Postal and Telecommunications Bureau has successfully trial-produced a single telex machine with dual-function recording. Using this machine can solve the problem of recording when sending telegrams with telex machines, ensuring the quality of telegrams.
    In the past, in order to keep a record when sending telegrams, so as to check whether there were errors, postal and telecommunications bureaus used two telex machines for each telex circuit, one for receiving and one for sending. This was a waste of telex equipment. Installing this recording machine on the telex machine can save one telex machine.
    This single telex machine with dual-function recording was successfully trial-produced by Lü Zhaoyi, the leader of the Telegraph Section Repair Group of the Qingdao Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, and Communist Youth League member Fu Menglong.

    一部电传机  发报又留底
    青岛邮电局试制成功了一部电传单机双作录底机。使用这种机器，可以解决电传机发报时的留底问题，保证发报质量。
    过去，邮电局发报时为了留底，以便查明是否发错，在每条电传电路用两部电传机，一收一发，这样过于浪费电传设备。在电传机上安上这种录底机，就可以省出一部电传机。
    这部电传单机双作录底机是青岛邮电局电报科维修组组长吕兆贻和共青团员傅梦龙试制成功的。
