Xinhua News Agency, 9th December: According to a TASS report: All seven giant blast furnaces planned for construction in the Soviet Union this year have been put into production. Their total production capacity is almost equal to the total production capacity of all the blast furnaces built by the Soviet Union during the first and second five-year plans (1928-1937). Such a scale of construction is unprecedented in the history of Soviet blast furnace construction. The seventh blast furnace recently put into production at the Ilyich Steel Plant in Zhdanov City and the Komsomol Blast Furnace built in Chelyabinsk a few weeks ago are the largest not only in the Soviet Union but also in all of Europe. They are all equipped with first-class technical equipment and have a very high level of production technology. For example, the entire operation process of the seventh blast furnace is automatically controlled by dozens of electronic instruments.

Five of these seven blast furnaces are built in the southern Soviet Union, and two are in the Urals.

This year is not only the year with the largest scale of blast furnace construction in the Soviet Union, but also the year with the fastest blast furnace construction speed. In the past, it would take at least three or four years to build such a huge blast furnace, but this year it only took six to eight months. This is mainly due to the high degree of industrialization of the blast furnace construction process. For example, prefabricated reinforced concrete components are widely used in the furnace construction process, and automatic machines are used to lift and install components weighing up to fifty tons.

In 1959, the Soviet Union will also build seven new blast furnaces in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the Urals, Siberia, and the central region with the same production capacity as this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th December: The New Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in the Ukrainian Republic recently manufactured the world's largest "2500 type" steel rolling mill. The steel rolled by this rolling mill annually is approximately equal to Russia's total annual steel production in 1913.

The production and operation process of this rolling mill is fully automated. It can roll ten-ton steel ingots into steel plates with a thickness of 1.5 mm to 12 mm. If the steel plates it produces annually are laid side by side, they can circle the Earth nine times.

From 1959 to 1965, the New Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant will produce fifty-seven various rolling mills, which can roll tens of millions of tons of steel and semi-finished products annually.

### 苏联钢铁战线出现强大生力军  今年新建七座巨型高炉全部上阵  制成世界最大轧钢机年产钢材可绕地球九周

    苏联钢铁战线出现强大生力军
    今年新建七座巨型高炉全部上阵
    制成世界最大轧钢机年产钢材可绕地球九周
    新华社9日讯  据塔斯社报道：今年苏联计划建设的七座巨型高炉已全部投入生产。它们的总生产能力几乎等于苏联在第一和第二个五年计划（1928—1937年）期间建设的全部高炉的生产能力的总和。这样的建设规模在苏联高炉建设史上还是空前的。最近在日丹诺夫城伊里奇钢铁厂投入生产的第七座高炉和几星期以前在车里雅宾斯克建成的共青团高炉，不仅在苏联，而且在全欧洲都是最大的。它们都拥有头等的技术装备，生产技术水平很高。例如，第七座高炉的全部操作过程都是由几十个电子仪器自动操纵的。
    这七座高炉中的五座建设在苏联南部，两座在乌拉尔。
    今年不仅是苏联高炉建设规模最大的一年，也是高炉建设速度最快的一年。过去，要建设像这样巨大的高炉至少需要三、四年的时间，而今年却只用了六个月到八个月的时间。这主要是由于高炉的建筑过程高度工业化的结果。例如，在建炉过程中广泛采用预装配钢筋混凝土构件，而且在安装构件时采用了自动机器，它们可以起升和安装重达五十吨的构件。
    1959年，苏联还将在乌克兰、哈萨克、乌拉尔、西伯利亚和中部地区建立七座与今年生产能力相等的新高炉。
    新华社9日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：乌克兰共和国的新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器制造厂最近制造成功一台世界上最大的“二五○○型”轧钢机。这台轧钢机每年轧制的钢材，约等于1913年俄国全年的钢材产量。
    这台轧钢机的生产和操作过程完全自动化，它可以把十吨的钢柱轧成一点五毫米到十二毫米厚的钢板。如果把它每年生产的这种钢板并排铺起来，就可以环绕地球九周。
    从1959年到1965年期间，新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器制造厂将生产五十七台各种轧钢机，它们每年总共可以轧制几千万吨钢材和半成品。
