Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 15th. The Southwest Region National Culture Work Conference, held in Dali City, Yunnan Province from the 8th to the 13th, decided to further and deeply carry out a mass movement for cultural popularization in the ethnic minority areas of the Southwest, and to carry out mass-based, gradual improvement work on the basis of popularization.

The face of the Southwest minority areas has undergone tremendous changes in the Great Leap Forward. Many ethnic minorities have leaped into socialism, and industrial and agricultural production and various socialist constructions have developed rapidly. People's communes have been realized in most areas. With the tremendous political and economic changes, a situation of cultural popularization has begun to take shape. Based on this situation, the meeting focused on discussing how to carry out mass cultural work in minority areas and further develop minority cultures. The meeting believes that although the situation of cultural popularization in the Southwest minority areas has begun to take shape, it is not solid enough, and the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach must continue to be used to engage in large-scale cultural popularization over the long term. "Small" means small-scale and diverse, "indigenous" means national forms, and "mass" means carrying out mass movements on a large scale. After the initial realization of cultural popularization, improvement becomes an important issue. Popularization must follow the mass line, and improvement must also follow the mass line. The meeting advocated that literary and artistic professionals combine with the ethnic minority masses, hoping that they will eat, live, and labor with the working people, while publicizing, working, performing, and tutoring, first as students, then as teachers. It is necessary to criticize the practice of imposing improvement regardless of the current economic and cultural development of the ethnic minorities.

Regarding the excavation, arrangement, and development of national cultural traditions, the meeting believes that the mass line must also be followed; it must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve politics and production, and launch mass movements. Only in this way can the old ethnic cultural forms be fully utilized and rapidly developed. The meeting believes that the path of Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture's Dabenqu and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture's Yi oral poems and song melodies developing into dramas reflecting real life is correct. With the development of production, according to whether it is conducive to production and socialism, national cultural heritage will inevitably be developed and also discarded.

    西南区民族文化工作会议决定进一步开展文化普及工作
    新华社昆明15日电  8日到13日在云南省大理市召开的西南区民族文化工作会议，决定在西南少数民族地区进一步深入地开展文化大普及的群众运动，在普及的基础上进行群众性的逐步提高的工作。
    西南少数民族地区的面貌在大跃进中起了巨大的变化，许多少数民族飞跃地进入了社会主义，工农业生产和各项社会主义建设迅速发展，大部分地区实现了人民公社化。随着政治上、经济上的巨大变化，文化大普及的形势也已开始形成。根据这种形势，会议着重讨论了如何开展少数民族地区的群众文化工作，进一步发展少数民族文化的问题。会议认为，西南少数民族地区文化大普及的形势虽然已经开始形成，但还不够巩固，要继续运用“小土群”方针，长期地大搞文化大普及。小是小型多样，土是民族形式，群是大搞群众运动。在文化大普及初步实现以后，提高就成了重要的问题。普及要走群众路线，提高也要走群众路线。会议提倡文艺专业工作人员和少数民族群众结合起来，希望他们和劳动人民同吃同住同劳动，边宣传、边工作、边演出、边辅导，先作学生，后作先生，要批判那种不顾少数民族经济文化发展的现状，强加提高的作法。
    关于发掘、整理和发展民族文化传统的问题，会议认为也必须走群众路线；必须为工农兵服务，为政治和生产服务，并掀起群众性的运动。只有这样，才能使旧的民族文化形式得到充分的运用和迅速的发展。会议认为，大理白族自治州的大本曲和楚雄彝族自治州彝族的口传诗歌曲调，在反映现实生活中发展成为戏剧的道路是正确的。随着生产的发展，根据是否有利于生产和社会主义，民族文化遗产必然会有所发展，也有所扬弃。
