Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 13th: The Chenghuang People's Commune in Yulin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is implementing democratic management, with cadres consulting with the masses on issues, leading to good winter production.

　　The Chenghuang Commune was established in mid-September by the union of eighteen agricultural cooperatives including the original Chenghuang Township, Fudi, and Daxi. After the establishment of the commune, it was the time when the whole region began a vigorous iron and steel campaign, and 4,800 laborers in the commune were put into the tense iron and steel production. Soon after, the commune's late rice matured and urgently needed to be harvested. The cadres saw that there were fewer laborers left behind to engage in agricultural production, so they initially decided to use forty days to harvest the late rice. After submitting the plan to the masses for discussion, the majority of commune members suggested that the rice must be harvested quickly when it is ripe. If the time is dragged on for too long, the ripe grains will fall off and rot, resulting in losses. In order to speed up the autumn harvest, commune members posted many big-character posters, suggesting that some of the logistics personnel be drawn to participate in the autumn harvest to form a "rush-harvesting" army. As a result, the number of laborers participating in the autumn harvest increased from more than 3,000 to more than 5,000, and the late rice was all harvested in twenty-five days.

　　More than forty kinds of sideline occupations originally managed by the eighteen agricultural cooperatives were transferred to the commune. Except for pig raising, fish farming, etc., most of them were stopped, and the income was greatly reduced. In mid-October, after the commune's management cadres discovered this problem, they convened a meeting of commune member representatives centering on this issue, and mobilized the masses to contribute ideas. Representatives from the Lishi production area, based on the local abundance of limestone, suggested burning lime; Daxi, Longkou and other production areas had abundant tree bark, so the representatives suggested using tree bark leaves to raise silkworms. At the meeting, commune member representatives proposed more than sixty kinds of sideline projects. After this meeting, not only were the original forty-plus sideline occupations restored, but more than twenty new sideline productions were added, such as silkworm raising, chicken raising, weaving rain hats, gunpowder, and papermaking. By November, the commune's sideline income had increased by an average of 4.5 times per month compared to before September.

　　In order to fully promote democracy and allow commune members to make criticisms and suggestions at any time, the commune's production team offices, sideline farms, workshops, and production teams all opened up "democratic life gardens." Since the establishment of the "democratic life gardens" in October, the masses have posted more than 113,400 big-character posters, summarizing 325 various opinions. For example, the pig farm in the Tainan production area was not doing a good job. Commune member Chen Facheng posted a big-character poster in the "democratic life garden" criticizing the deputy director Li Shide in charge of sideline occupations for not paying attention to it. The criticized Li Shide immediately made a self-criticism to the masses, and two or three days later, he moved his luggage to the pig farm to eat, live, and work with the breeders. With his help, the pigs were fed three meals a day instead of two, and the situation of thin and sick pigs quickly improved.

　　When the commune first announced deep plowing, the masses believed that the soil was hard and could not be deeply plowed. Li Shide, the Party branch secretary of the Liantang production area, went deep into the Wu Xinmao production team and worked with the commune members, personally using a new-style walking plow to cultivate the land to a depth of one foot; then he convened a field meeting of deep plowing backbone members from various teams to the Wu Xinmao production team to visit and learn, mobilizing everyone to overcome the difficulties of hard soil. From the end of November to December 3rd, the commune had deeply plowed more than 11,000 mu, completing one-third of the arable paddy field area.

### 城隍人民公社遇事同群众商量  管理民主化  生产有起色

    城隍人民公社遇事同群众商量
    管理民主化  生产有起色
    新华社南宁13日电  广西僮族自治区玉林县城隍人民公社实行管理民主化，干部有事与群众商量，冬季生产领导得很好。
    城隍公社是由原城隍乡福地、大西等十八个农业社在9月中旬联合办起来的。公社建立后，正是全区大搞钢铁运动开始的时候，公社有四千八百个劳动力投入了紧张的钢铁生产。不久，社里晚稻成熟，急待收割。干部看到留在后方搞农业生产的劳动力较少，就初步确定用四十天时间来收割晚稻。把计划交给群众讨论后，多数社员提出稻谷熟了一定要抢收，如果时间拖得过长，熟透的谷子会掉粒霉烂，遭受损失。为了加快秋收速度，社员贴出了许多大字报，建议抽一部分后勤人员参加秋收，组成抢收大军。这样做的结果，参加秋收的劳动力由原来的三千多人增加到了五千多人，二十五天就把晚稻全部收割完了。
    由原来十八个农业社经营的四十多种副业，转入公社后，除了养猪、养鱼等以外，绝大部分停了下来，收入大大减少。10月中旬，社里管理干部发现这个问题后，就以这个问题为中心召开社员代表大会，发动群众多方献计。立石生产区的代表根据当地石灰岩多的情况，建议烧石灰；大西、龙口等生产区木茹多，代表们就建议利用木茹叶养蚕。会上，社员代表们共提出了六十多种副业项目。这次大会以后，不仅恢复了原来经营的四十多种副业，并且新增加了养蚕、养鸡、编雨帽、火药、造纸等二十多种副业生产。到11月份，全社的副业收入就比9月以前每月平均增加四点五倍。
    为了充分发扬民主，让社员随时提出批评建议，公社各生产队办公室、副业场、工场、各生产队都开辟了“民主生活园地”。“民主生活园地”从10月创办到现在，群众共贴出大字报十一万三千四百多张，归纳各种意见有三百二十五条。如铁南生产区养猪场工作做得不好，社员陈发成在“民主生活园地”贴了一张大字报，批评管副业的副主任李士德为什么不过问。被批评的李士德，立即向群众作了检讨，两三天以后就把自己的行李搬到养猪场去，和饲养员同吃同住同劳动。在他的帮助下，猪由一天两餐改为三餐，瘦猪病猪的情况很快好转了。
    公社开始公布深耕的时候，群众认为泥土硬不能深耕，连塘生产区党支部书记黎世德就深入到吴新茂生产队和社员一起劳动，亲自用一架新式步犁来耕地，耕深达一尺；随后他便召集各队深耕骨干分子到吴新茂生产队开现场会议，边参观，边学习，发动大家克服泥土硬的困难。从11月下旬开始到12月3日止，全社已深耕一万一千多亩，完成应耕稻田面积三分之一。
