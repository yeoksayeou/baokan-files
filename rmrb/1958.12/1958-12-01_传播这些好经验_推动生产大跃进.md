Spread These Good Experiences and Promote the Great Leap Forward in Production

	Ceramic Mine Pillars Replace Pit Props

	The Guanshan Coal Mine in Yuxian County, Henan Province, has adopted ceramic mine pillars to replace pit props, opening up a new way to solve the problem of insufficient pit props in the rapid development of the coal industry. The Ministry of Coal Industry recently held an on-site meeting in the Guanshan Coal Mine, preparing to promote this experience.

	The Guanshan Coal Mine has been using ceramic mine pillars for more than a year, and the situation is very good. No accidents have occurred. The entire mine has used 12,500 ceramic mine pillars, replacing 450 cubic meters of pit props.

	The meeting believed that the advantages of using ceramic mine pillars are: abundant and convenient sources of raw materials, which can be sourced, manufactured, and used locally; the manufacturing process is relatively simple; the cost is low; and they have fireproof, pressure-resistant, and corrosion-resistant properties, making them cleaner and more hygienic than pit props.

	Clay Makes Soap, Reclaimed Rubber Makes Shoes

	The Ministry of Commerce recently held a national department store on-site meeting in Chongqing, focusing on introducing Chongqing's experience in using acidic clay as a filler to manufacture soap and using reclaimed rubber to make rubber shoes.

	The practice of two soap factories in Chongqing proves that each ton of clay soap produced can save 341 kilograms of mixed oils and 124.47 kilograms of liquid alkali. Rubber shoes made with reclaimed rubber can reduce the amount of raw rubber used by half. The Chongqing Zhongnan Rubber Factory has now produced hundreds of thousands of pairs of such rubber shoes to supply the market, and the use effect is very good.

	Making Measurement Instruments with Indigenous Methods

	Measurement departments across the country have created many air volume, air pressure, and air temperature control instruments for indigenous blast furnaces in the mass movement of vigorously developing iron and steel production. The National Bureau of Metrology recently held a national measurement work on-site meeting in Changzhou, Jiangsu, to summarize and exchange information and experience in this regard.

	In just over a month, measurement workers in Liaoning, Jinzhou, Zhengzhou, Beijing, Hebei and other places, through jointly smelting iron with workers and collective research, created a total of 84 types and 164 pieces of indigenous air volume, air pressure, and air temperature instruments. For example, the leaping-forward high-temperature meter created by measurement workers in Shenyang City is like a short measuring ruler, lightweight and agile, which can be put in a pocket and taken out at any time.

	Accelerate the Manufacture of Automobile Trailers

	The Ministry of Communications recently held a national automobile transportation system smelting and casting on-site meeting in Kunming, focusing on the exchange of experience in accelerating the manufacture of trailers by replacing forging with casting and steel with iron.

	The meeting believed that vigorously promoting automobile trailers is an effective way to improve automobile carrying capacity. To produce trailers in large quantities, it is necessary to rely on our own efforts to make large-scale use of indigenous steel and iron, replace forging with casting and steel with iron, and self-manufacture trailer steel rims and axles. The meeting decided to achieve one trailer per vehicle within the year, and strive for two trailers per vehicle.

	"Small Indigenous Groups" Produce Sulfuric Acid

	The Ministry of Chemical Industry recently held a national on-site meeting in Wuhan to exchange design and production experience of indigenous tower sulfuric acid, with the Wuchang Chemical Plant as a typical example to exchange experience.

	According to the experience of the Wuchang Chemical Plant, the meeting believed that it is of great significance to vigorously develop small indigenous groups in sulfuric acid production. These indigenous small-scale sulfuric acid manufacturing enterprises use all ceramic cylinders and bamboo and wood to make the equipment, without using a single piece of steel. The investment is saved and the results are quick. For example, the entire investment of this indigenous tower sulfuric acid workshop in the Wuchang Chemical Plant was only more than 5,000 yuan, and it was put into production in ten days. The construction of a large-scale sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 4,000 tons would require an investment of at least more than 1 million yuan, and the construction time would be long.

    传播这些好经验  推动生产大跃进
    陶瓷矿柱代坑木
    河南禹县官山煤矿采用陶瓷矿柱代替坑木，为解决煤炭工业迅速发展中坑木不足的问题开辟了新的途径。煤炭工业部最近在官山煤矿召开了现场会议，准备推广这一经验。
    官山煤矿使用陶瓷矿柱已一年多，情况很好，没有发生过事故。全矿已用了一万二千五百根陶瓷矿柱，代用了坑木四百五十立方公尺。
    会议认为采用陶瓷矿柱的优点是：原料来源丰富方便，可以就地取材、就地制造、就地使用；制造过程比较简单；成本低廉；具有防火、耐压、防腐的性能，比使用坑木清洁卫生。
    白土造肥皂  再生胶做鞋
    商业部最近在重庆召开全国百货现场会议，着重介绍了重庆用酸性白土作填充剂制造肥皂和再生胶制胶鞋的经验。
    重庆两个肥皂厂的实践证明，每生产一吨白土肥皂，可以节约混合油脂三百四十一公斤，液碱一百二十四点四七公斤。掺用再生胶制成的胶鞋，可以使生胶用量降低一半。现在重庆中南橡胶厂已经生产出几十万双这种胶鞋供应市场，使用效果很好。
    用土办法制计量仪表
    全国各地计量部门在大搞钢铁生产的群众运动中创造了许多土高炉用的风量、风压、风温控制仪表。国家计量局最近在江苏常州召开全国计量工作现场会议，总结和交流了这方面的情况和经验。
    辽宁、锦州、郑州、北京、河北等地的计量工作人员，在短短的一个多月时间内，由于和工人共同炼铁，集体研究，创造了各种风量、风压、风温土仪表共八十四种、一百六十四件。如沈阳市计量工作人员创造的跃进式高温计，像一把短短的计量尺，轻便灵巧，可以装在口袋里，随时取用。
    加速制造汽车挂车
    交通部最近在昆明召开了全国汽车运输系统冶炼铸造现场会议，着重交流了以铸代锻、以铁代钢加速制造挂车的经验。
    会议认为，大力推行汽车挂车，是提高汽车运力的有效办法。要大量生产挂车，就必须自力更生地大量利用土钢土铁，以铸代锻、以铁代钢，自制挂车钢圈和车轴。会议确定在年内实现一车一挂，争取一车两挂。
    “小土群”造硫酸
    化学工业部最近在武汉召开全国土法塔式硫酸设计、生产经验交流现场会议，以武昌化工厂为典型交流了经验。
    根据武昌化工厂的经验，会议认为当前在制造硫酸方面大搞小土群有着十分重要的意义。这种土法小型的硫酸制造企业，全部设备都是用陶制缸管和竹木做成的，不用一根钢材，投资既省，收效又快。像武昌化工厂这座土法塔式硫酸车间，全部投资不过五千多元，十天就投入生产。而建设一个年产四千吨的大型制酸工厂，至少要投资一百多万元，建设时间也长。
