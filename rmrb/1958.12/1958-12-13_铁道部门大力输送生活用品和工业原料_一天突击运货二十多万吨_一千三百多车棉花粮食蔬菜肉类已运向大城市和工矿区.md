Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch. The first round of the national railway department's commercial transportation blitz has achieved great results. From 6:00 PM on December 10th to 6:00 PM on December 11th, the national railway department rushed to load more than 200,000 tons of various daily necessities and industrial raw materials, exceeding the planned loading target by 60%, which is more than 2,500 train cars more than usual. Among these materials, more than 1,300 train cars of cotton, grain, vegetables, and meat have been transported to major cities and industrial and mining areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, and Anshan. At present, the railway department is continuing to do a good job in the regular transportation of people's daily necessities, and is preparing to carry out necessary blitz transportation at an appropriate time.

The Ministry of Railways held a telephone conference this afternoon, and Liu Jianzhang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, made a preliminary summary of this blitz transportation. He said that the victory of this commercial material blitz transportation was achieved under the leadership of the Party and government in various regions, with close cooperation between the railway and commercial departments, and through vigorous mass movements. Party and government leading departments in various provinces and cities attached great importance to and supported this blitz transportation. Many Party and government leaders personally took charge, established special agencies, and mobilized thousands of masses to participate in short-distance transportation, forming a massive mass movement, which is the fundamental reason for the victory.

Secondly, the leaders at all levels and the vast number of employees of the railway department also attached great importance to this blitz transportation, generally regarding this work as a political task to be completed. Under the transportation policy of "guaranteeing key points and taking care of general needs," various railway bureaus tried their best to tap transportation potential to do a good job in this blitz transportation. For example, the "marshal leading logistics" transportation method created by the Shanghai Railway Bureau has been promoted in other railway bureaus; the Shenyang Railway Bureau used passenger cars, baggage cars, guard cars, and suburban trains to transport daily necessities, not letting go of any usable transportation force. The Jinan Railway Bureau more widely used empty cars traveling in the same direction and train stopover time to transport "less-than-carload" goods, so that large quantities of materials went to the countryside and cities. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau ranked the transportation of daily necessities, determining that the transportation of daily necessities for large cities and steel bases should be given priority. The implementation of these measures ensured that the blitz transportation achieved the desired results.

Third, the close cooperation between the railway department and the commercial department is also an important reason for the success of this blitz transportation. For example, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce established a joint office, and the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce sent responsible cadres to work at the Guangzhou Railway Bureau; the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Commerce and the Xi'an Railway Bureau jointly held a telephone conference, etc. This kind of cooperation enables both parties to understand the source of goods and the situation of vehicles, so that goods and vehicles can better cooperate, greatly reducing the phenomenon of separation of vehicles and goods.

Liu Jianzhang pointed out that the transportation of daily necessities and industrial raw materials is a regular task, not something that can be completed with one blitz. Moreover, this blitz transportation has not fully met the requirements of the commercial department in terms of vehicle allocation. Therefore, it is required that all regions summarize the experience of this blitz transportation, and some good experiences should be applied to regular transportation. The commercial materials that have arrived at the station must be arranged for vehicles in regular transportation to ensure their transportation. In particular, perishable and easily rotten commodities should be given priority in transportation. Finally, Liu Jianzhang also asked all regions to continue to organize sources of goods and prepare to organize another national blitz transportation at an appropriate time; various railway bureaus can also organize several small blitz transportations without affecting the overall national transportation tasks to ensure the supply of daily necessities for urban and rural people.

    铁道部门大力输送生活用品和工业原料
    一天突击运货二十多万吨
    一千三百多车棉花粮食蔬菜肉类已运向大城市和工矿区
    新华社12日讯  全国铁路部门商业运输突击战的第一个回合取得了很大成绩。从12月10日下午六时到11日下午六时，全国铁路部门共突击装运各种日用生活必需品和工业原料二十多万吨，超额60％完成了预定的装车计划，比平时多装了二千五百多车、这些物资中，有一千三百多车棉花、粮食、蔬菜、肉类已运向北京、天津、上海、武汉、沈阳、鞍山等大城市和工矿区。目前铁路部门正在继续做好人民生活必需品的经常运输工作，并且准备在适当时机再进行必要的突击运输。
    铁道部在今天下午召开电话会议，铁道部副部长刘建章对这一次的突击运输作了初步总结。他说，这次商业物资突击运输的胜利是在各地党、政领导下，铁道部门和商业部门密切配合，大搞群众运动获得的。各省市党政领导部门对这次突击运输都十分重视与支持，不少党、政负责人亲自挂帅，成立专门的机构，又发动成千上万的群众，参加短途运输，形成了声势浩大的群众运动，这是取得胜利的根本原因。
    其次，铁路部门的各级领导和广大员工对这次突击运输也十分重视，一般都把这一工作当作政治任务来完成。各路局在“保证重点、照顾一般”的运输方针下，千方百计地挖掘运输潜力，来搞好这一次突击运输。如上海铁路局创造的“元帅带后勤”的运输方法，已在其他路局推广；沈阳铁路局利用客车、行李车、守车和近郊列车来装运日用品，不放过一个可以利用的运输力量。济南铁路局更广泛利用顺路空车和列车在站停留时间装运“零担”，使大批物资上城下乡。郑州铁路局对日用必需品的运输进行了排队，确定供应大城市和钢铁基地的生活用品优先运输，这些办法的实施，保证了突击运输取得应有的效果。
    第三，铁路部门和商业部门的密切协作，也是这次突击运输取得成绩的重要原因。例如郑州铁路局和河南省商业厅成立了联合办公室，广东省商业厅派了负责干部到广州铁路局办公；陕西省商业厅和西安铁路局联合召开电话会议等等，这种协作，使双方都能了解货源和车辆情况，使货与车更好地配合，大大减少了车、货脱节的现象。
    刘建章指出，日用生活必需品和工业原料的运输是一个经常任务，不是突击一次就完了，而且这一次的突击运输在车辆的调拨方面还没有完全满足商业部门的要求。因此要求各地把这次突击运输的经验总结一下，有一些好的经验要运用到经常运输中去。目前已经到站的商业物资，必须在经常运输中安排车辆，保证运出。特别是易腐、易烂的商品更应优先运输。刘建章最后还要求各地继续组织货源，准备在适当时机再组织一次全国性的突击运输；各路局在不影响国家总的运输任务的情况下，也可以组织几次小的突击运输，以保证城乡人民生活用品的供应。
