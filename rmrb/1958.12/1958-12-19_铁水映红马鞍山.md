    Molten Iron Lights Up Ma'anshan
    By Our Correspondent Yu Ming
    A Place of Historical Significance
    Taking a train from Nanjing on the Wuning Line along the south bank of the Yangtze River, it takes less than an hour to reach Ma'anshan. Ma'anshan City and its subordinate Dangtu and He County have been strategically important and scenic spots since ancient times. There are many legends about this place. Some say that after the Concubine Yu separated from King Xiang, she fled to the point opposite Ma'anshan where the Wu River flows into the Yangtze. First, she asked a boatman to ferry the horse across the Yangtze, but as soon as the horse crossed the river, the Han soldiers arrived. King Chu committed suicide at the Wu River. The horse, seeing its master dead, also jumped into the river. The boatman buried the unloaded saddle on the mountain, hence the name Ma'anshan (Saddle Mountain). The Caishiji (Islet of Cai), a place near the river in this city, is said to be where the Jin Dynasty general Xie Shang and the poet Yuan Hong recited poetry and talked eloquently under the moonlight; where the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai, drunk under the moonlight, jumped into the river to catch the moon; and where Chang Yuchun, a general under Zhu Yuanzhang during the Ming Dynasty, fought three battles at Caishiji when he marched south to conquer the area. Because of these legends, many people who came here in the past were tourists visiting scenic spots and historical sites. Now, people come here and are attracted by the magnificent scene of building socialism. This is a battlefield, a battlefield where tens of thousands of people are fighting for steel, and it is one of China's important iron and steel bases.
    A Stream of People Opening Mountains to Extract Treasure
    As soon as you arrive at the Jinjiazhuang Station in Ma'anshan, the atmosphere of fighting for steel attracts you. Here, trains and cars come and go in an endless stream, fully loaded with coke and equipment, and leaving fully loaded with iron, steel, and ore. People are lined up along the way to carry materials, and the flow of people is constant, stretching for several miles.
    I went to visit the mine. After going up Nanshan Mountain, I looked around and saw that many hilltops were covered with mining machines. The iron ore here is truly abundant. In the open air, a mining machine can open up a large area with one pass. Cars transport the ore down the mountain, where it is crushed and can be used for iron smelting without selection, because most of it is rich ore with an iron content of over 50%. The comrades who were mining asked a few of us to lift a piece of ore. Although the ore was not large, we couldn't lift it at all; it was simply a block of iron. In addition, a small portion of the ore was transported to the other side. I asked curiously why it was divided into two piles. The mining comrade pointed to it and said, "This is lower-grade ore, which is set aside for future use." A colleague added, "In other large iron and steel bases, this lower-grade ore is still considered a treasure!"
    Since this year, Ma'anshan's iron ore has had a new source. I remember two years ago, the Party secretaries of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Xiangshan Pyrite Mine told me that because pyrite was not comprehensively utilized, only sulfur was selected and not iron, so the iron in the pyrite was discarded as waste, resulting in a great waste of resources. This time, I paid special attention to this matter. Unexpectedly, when I went down to the Xiangshan Pyrite Mine, before I could even speak, the workers excitedly told me that the Xiangshan Pyrite Mine was now selecting both sulfur and iron, which not only increased the production of sulfur, but also the iron powder produced was welcomed by the iron smelting units. The workers looked very happy when talking about this!
    The responsible comrades in Ma'anshan told me that the proven iron ore reserves in Ma'anshan now amount to more than 500 million tons, and there are also many rare metals. Now, Ma'anshan's rich ore not only meets the needs of Anhui Province, but is also transported in large quantities to Anshan, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shijingshan and other places. Ma'anshan's mines are the treasure mountains of the motherland.
    Writing Guarantees with Molten Iron
    "Writing guarantees with molten iron, writing good guarantees to send to Beijing, the guarantee has seven words: not a ton less of steel!" This is the battle song sung by the steel warriors of Ma'anshan after the central government called for a great leap in steel production. After August 20th, the Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee led all the city's workers into battle. The most important thing was to increase the new force in steelmaking and iron smelting. Within forty days, they would build two larger blast furnaces of more than 200 cubic meters in East China and establish a large number of small blast furnaces of less than 28 cubic meters, so that Ma'anshan would have both large, medium, and small furnaces, and a prosperous family! They fulfilled their promise. Within forty days, the No. 4 and No. 5 medium-sized blast furnaces and many small blast furnaces were successively put into production. The furnace builders from Anshan, on the No. 5 blast furnace, doubled the bricklaying speed compared to the fastest speed in the past, and the No. 4 furnace was completed four days ahead of the No. 5 furnace. Then the No. 2 medium-sized blast furnace and many small blast furnaces and steelmaking converters were also put into production within a few months, making Ma'anshan's daily pig iron production several times higher than in the previous nine months.
    In the iron smelting plant, I saw the fighting scene of the workers. At 5 p.m. one day, when I arrived at the No. 5 blast furnace, the molten iron in the furnace was flowing outwards, filling the casting bed. While the iron had not yet cooled down, the workers were already wielding sledgehammers to break up and lift the iron. As soon as the iron blocks were lifted, another furnace of iron flowed out in less than an hour. The young furnace workers were sweating profusely in the cold weather, but they said, "The more iron comes out, the happier we are!" This furnace used to produce only nine batches of iron a day, but that day it had already produced fifteen batches before 6 p.m. Yang Zhishan, the Party branch secretary of the No. 2 furnace, had been eating, living, and working with everyone for several months, uniting all the furnace workers and foremen like a family. Zhou Zhaode, a female intern foreman, said, "Secretary Yang leads everyone in such good cooperation that we can quickly negotiate and solve any small accidents." Thanks to everyone's joint efforts, this furnace produced an average of one-half more iron per day than in the previous months. In other departments, they are also working hard for "not a ton less of steel." At the transportation department, I met Xie Jichu, a young man in his twenties, who broke the rules not long ago by implementing multi-car hauling at high speed, doubling the number of vehicles transported. Now everyone is moving forward after him, aiming for a two-fold or three-fold increase. When the director of the machine repair factory led me to visit, he pointed out the situation of arming themselves with various methods. Within nine months, the factory had developed to the point where it could manufacture complete sets of equipment for small blast furnaces within 100 cubic meters and 3-ton and 6-ton converters, except for electric motors, and could also manufacture most of the accessories for medium-sized blast furnaces. Now all the city's workers are continuing to fight to complete this year's production target of more than 470,000 tons of iron and more than 100,000 tons of steel.
    A Good Pair of Brothers
    In Ma'anshan, I had several opportunities to stop on the hillside and look at its night view. This is not a quiet night. It seems to be boiling at all times. To my right is the wide Yangtze River, with giant ships docked at several docks, where people are busy loading and unloading. Perhaps this is coke transported from all over the country. Look at how big the stomach of the Ma'anshan iron furnace is! It eats thousands of tons every day, and the food reserves are only one or two days. Perhaps this is iron being transported to Shanghai. Shanghai and Ma'anshan are now simply a good pair of brothers. When Shanghai lacks pig iron for steelmaking, Ma'anshan is the most able to provide emergency relief, but Ma'anshan has to rely on Shanghai for those machines and equipment. After seeing these things, and thinking about the dialects of the trainee workers in the iron smelting workshop, it is natural to connect Ma'anshan with all parts of the country. Our motherland is showing a scene of ten thousand horses galloping forward under such mutual support from all over the country. In front of me, the chimneys of the blast furnaces stand like a forest. On the top of the furnace and around it, countless electric lights are like stars scattered in the air. In every iron smelting workshop, molten iron is constantly surging, like fiery dragons. The small train at the foot of the mountain pulled the iron slag past with a clang, the slag basin was burned red, and when it returned it was like a series of rising suns. On the many hillsides and in the valleys to my left and behind, small blast furnaces, small earthen furnaces, and coke ovens were all lit, illuminating the sky above Ma'anshan in a fiery red color.

    铁水映红马鞍山
    本报记者  于明
    古来名地
    从南京搭火车，穿行在长江南岸的芜宁线上，用不着一个钟头，就到马鞍山了。马鞍山市和它所属的当涂、和县，自古就是兵家必争之地，又是风景胜地。这里有种种传说。有的说，霸王别姬以后，逃到马鞍山对岸乌江入江的地方，先请船夫渡马过长江，但是马刚渡江，汉兵即至，楚王自刎乌江，马回首见主人已死，也跳水死去。船夫把卸下的马鞍埋在山上，马鞍山因此得名。这个市临江的采石矶，传说是晋大将谢尚和诗人袁宏月夜咏诗、高谈阔论的地方；是唐朝诗人李白月夜酒醉、跳江捞月的地方；传说明朝朱元璋兵下江南时，他的大将常遇春三打采石矶，也在这里。因为有这些传说，所以过去到这里来的，不少人是游览名胜古迹的。现在人们来到这里，却为轰轰烈烈建设社会主义的图景所吸引。这里是战场，是千万人民为钢铁而战的战场，是我国重要钢铁基地之一。
    开山取宝的人流
    一到马鞍山的金家庄车站，为钢铁而战的气氛就把人吸引住了。这里火车、汽车川流不息，满载焦炭、器材而来，满载钢铁、矿石而去，沿途人们列队挑运，人流不断，绵延几里。
    我到矿山去参观。上了南山，四周一看，许多山头都是开矿的机器。这里的铁矿真丰富。在露天里，开山机一开就是一大片。汽车把它运到山下，经过捣碎，不用选就能炼铁。因为这里大部分都是含铁量50％以上的富矿。开矿的同志让我们几个人抬一块矿石，矿石虽然不大，却始终没有把它抬起来，它简直就是一块铁。另外有很少一部分矿石运到另一边了，我奇怪地问，为什么要分成两块堆放呢？开矿的同志便指给我说：“这是品位比较低的矿石，是放到一边等以后再用的。”而同行的同志却补充说：“在其他大的钢铁基地，把这些品位较低的矿石还当作宝贝哩！”
    今年以来，马鞍山的铁矿又有了新的来源。记得两年以前，马鞍山铁厂和向山硫铁矿的党委书记曾对我谈过因为硫铁矿没有综合利用，只选硫不选铁，所以把硫铁矿中的铁都当作废品扔了，结果造成很大的资源浪费。这次，我特别注意了这件事。岂知我下到向山硫铁矿的矿井，还没有开口，工人同志们便拿着矿石兴奋地告诉我说：向山硫铁矿是既选硫又选铁的，不但增加了硫的产量，选出的铁矿粉还受到炼铁单位的欢迎哩。工人同志们在谈说这件事的时候，表现得很愉快！
    马鞍山的负责同志告诉我，现在马鞍山已探明的铁矿储量达五亿多吨，并且有不少稀有金属。现在马鞍山的富矿不但在供应安徽本省的需要，还大量运出供应鞍钢、太原、上海、天津和石景山等地。马鞍山的矿山，是祖国的宝山。
    笔蘸铁水写保证
    “笔蘸铁水写保证，写好保证寄北京，保证书上七个字：钢铁决不少一吨！”这是马鞍山的钢铁战士们，在中央号召大炼钢铁后唱出的战歌。8月20日以后，马鞍山市委便领导全市职工投入了战斗。最主要的，是增加炼钢炼铁的生力军。要在四十天内，把华东地区较大的两座二百立方以上的高炉建设起来，建立一大批二十八立方以下的小高炉，让马鞍山地区大中小并举，子孙满堂！他们实现了自己的诺言。就在四十天内，四、五号两座中型高炉和许多小高炉，果然相继投入了生产。来自鞍山的筑炉工人们，在五号高炉上，把砌砖速度比过去最快速度还加快了一倍，四号炉则比五号炉又提前了四天。接着二号中型高炉和许多小高炉、炼钢转炉，也都在几个月内便投入生产，使马鞍山的生铁日产量比前九个月成倍地增产。
    在炼铁厂，我看到了工人们战斗的情景。一天下午五时，我到五号高炉时，炉里的铁水正在向外奔流，铸床灌得满满的，在铁还没有冷下来时，工人们已经抡着铁锤捣铁和抬铁。铁块刚刚抬完，不到一小时便又有一炉铁水流出来了。年青的炉前工们在大冷的天气里，都热得汗流浃背，但是他们说：“铁越出的多，干得越高兴！”这个炉子，过去一天只出九次铁，但是那天还不到下午六时已出了十五炉铁。二号炉的党支部书记杨智山，几月来和大家同吃同住同劳动，把全炉工人和工长团结得像一家人一样。女实习工长周昭德说：“杨书记领导大家协作得真好，有一点小事故，我们便很快协商解决了。”在这个炉子上，由于大家的共同努力，比前几个月每天平均多出铁二分之一。在其他部门，也为“决不少一吨钢铁”鼓着干劲。我在运输处碰到一个二十几岁的青年谢吉初，就是他，在不久前打破了陈规，实行机车多拉快跑，把装运车辆提高一倍，现在大家已在他之后，向增加二倍三倍前进了。在机修厂，厂长带领我参观时，指出了用各种各样办法武装自己的情况，这个厂在九个月内，便发展到除电动机外，能制造一百立方以内小高炉和三吨、六吨转炉的整套设备，并能自制中型高炉的大部配件了。现在全市职工正在为完成今年产铁四十七万多吨，钢十万多吨继续奋战。
    一对好兄弟
    在马鞍山，我曾有好几次，停留在高山坡上，看它的夜景。这不是静静的夜。它在任何时候都是沸腾着似的。在我的右边是宽阔的长江，好几个码头上停着巨轮，人们正在紧张地装卸。也许这是从全国各地运来的焦炭，你看马鞍山铁炉最近的肚子有多大啊！它天天吃上千吨，存粮只有一、两天。也许这是运往上海的铁吧，上海——马鞍山现在简直是一对要好的兄弟，上海炼钢缺少生铁时，马鞍山是最能救急的，可是那些机器和器材，马鞍山却是要靠上海了。看了这些，想想那些炼铁车间实习工的南腔北调，就自然把马鞍山和全国各地连在一起了。我们的祖国各地，就是在这样彼此支援下出现了万马奔腾的局面。在我的对面，高炉的烟囱矗立像森林。在炉顶和它的四周，无数的电灯，像撒在半空的星星，每一个炼铁车间里，都不断地有铁水在奔腾，煞像一条条的火龙。山下的小火车拉着铁渣当当的过去了，渣盆被烧得通红，回来时像是一连串初升的太阳。在我的左面和后面的许多山坡上、山凹里，小高炉、小土炉、炼焦炉都升起了火，把马鞍山的上空照得火红。
