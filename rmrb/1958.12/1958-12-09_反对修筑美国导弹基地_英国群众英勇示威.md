    Against the Construction of American Missile Bases
    British Masses Courageously Demonstrate
    (By this newspaper) A fierce struggle took place in Britain a few days ago: masses demonstrated against the construction of American missile bases, and military personnel and police took brutal measures to deal with the demonstrators. This incident fully exposed the determination of the British rulers to betray national interests and stand in opposition to the British people.
    American Bases Densely Packed - People Hate Them Intensely
    The small British Isles are covered with American air force bases. American heavy supersonic bombers fly at low altitude over the heads of the British people every day. The noise and vibration of these planes make it almost impossible for residents near the air force bases to live. More seriously, these American air force bases turn the British Isles into a target for retaliation in a future war, threatening the safety of the British people. This situation has increasingly aroused dissatisfaction among people of all strata. During the recent visit of American Vice President Nixon to Britain, London held a massive demonstration against American bases. However, the Conservative government, in order to show "Anglo-American cooperation" and earn US dollars, refused to change its policy of using its territory as American bases, and is beginning to build missile bases for the United States. This disastrous behavior of the British government aroused great anger among the people.
    Masses Hold Demonstrations - Unwilling to See Homeland Destroyed
    British masses held a demonstration near Swaffham in Norfolk, eastern England, on the 6th to protest the construction of an American rocket base in the area. Forty-six demonstrators climbed over wire fences to enter the rocket base construction site. They surrounded a huge concrete mixer, advised the workers to stop working, and blocked the roads used by trucks carrying concrete to prevent the construction of the base.
    Military and Police Ordered to Deal With Demonstrators - Using Force Against Demonstrators
    Police dispatched to intervene attacked the demonstrators, and a melee ensued. The demonstrators were pushed into the mud. (See the picture below). The police used water cannons to attack the demonstrators, and many people's clothes were soaked. The police also rudely grabbed the hair of some of the women participating in the demonstration and pushed them into the mud pits. The police later drove the demonstrators out of the base. However, the demonstrators remained at the entrance of the base, blocking the gate and refusing to leave. Twenty-four of them camped out at the gate that night to continue their protest.
    Not Afraid of Reactionary Violence - The Masses Continue Their Efforts
    On the 7th, the demonstrators continued their efforts, and some tried to climb over the wire fence to stop the construction work. Others sat on the road leading to the base construction site, blocking the trucks that were driving in and preventing them from entering the base. British police and the Royal Air Force once again acted ferociously, beating the demonstrators.
    Labour MP, Mr. Swinger, said, "It seems that the police are doing this to provoke violent action and riots."

### 反对修筑美国导弹基地  英国群众英勇示威

    反对修筑美国导弹基地
    英国群众英勇示威
    本报讯  前几天在英国发生了一场激烈的斗争：群众示威反对修筑美国导弹基地，军事人员和警察采取凶暴的手段来对付示威者。这件事情充分暴露了英国的统治者为了出卖民族利益，坚决同英国人民站在敌对的地位。
    美国基地密布  人民恨之入骨
    在小小的英伦三岛布满了美国空军基地。美国的重型超音速轰炸机每天在英国人民头上低空飞行，这些飞机的喧闹声和震动声使得空军基地附近的居民简直无法生活下去。更严重的是这些美国空军基地使英伦三岛变成在未来战争中遭受回击的靶子，威胁着英国人民的安全。这种状况已日益引起各阶层人民的不满。在最近美国副总统尼克松访问英国的时候，伦敦就曾经举行了声势巨大的反对美国基地的示威。但是保守党政府为了表示“英美合作”和赚取美元，不肯改变它把国土充当美国基地的政策，而且正在开始为美国建立导弹基地。英国政府这种祸国殃民的行径激起人民极大愤怒。
    群众举行示威  不愿国土被毁
    英国群众6日在英格兰东部诺福克的斯沃弗姆附近举行示威，反对在当地建筑美国火箭基地。四十六名示威者攀越铁丝网进入火箭基地建筑工地。他们把一个巨大的混凝土搅拌机围了起来，劝告工人们停止工作，挡住了运送混凝土的卡车来往的道路，以制止这个基地的建设工程的进行。
    军警奉命对付  对示威者用武
    被派来进行干涉的警察袭击示威者，双方发生混战，示威者们被推进了泥水里。（见下图）警察用水龙进攻示威者，许多人的衣服湿透了。警察还粗暴地抓住了某些参加示威的妇女的头发，把她们推进泥坑里。警察后来把这些示威者赶出了基地。但是，示威者仍然留在这个基地的入口处，把住大门不走。他们之中的二十四人当晚就露宿在这个大门外，继续进行抗议。
    不畏反动暴力  群众再接再厉
    7日，示威者再接再厉，有些人曾经设法爬过铁丝网来阻止建筑工程的进行。其他人则坐在通往基地建筑地点的道路上阻挡开来的卡车，不让它们进入基地。英国警察和皇家空军再次逞凶，殴打示威者。
    工党议员斯文格勒说：“看来警察这样做是想挑起暴力行动和骚乱。”
