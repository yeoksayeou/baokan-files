According to the Shanxi Daily, the Licheng County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is transferring personnel and mobilizing the masses to seriously rectify the financial management work of the communes.

In the initial stage of the people's communes in this county, due to neglecting the rectification of financial management and the failure to catch up with political and ideological work in time, some chaotic phenomena occurred in financial work. In response to this situation, the Licheng County Party Committee proposed that the secretaries take the lead, with politics taking precedence, to rectify finances. It transferred thirty-four cadres proficient in accounting from grain bureaus, banks, and other enterprises to cooperate with the commune and the original agricultural cooperatives' more than four hundred and seventy financial accounting personnel, forming a financial clearing workforce, divided into more than one hundred teams, responsible for clearing. In order to gain experience, a pilot project was conducted in the Cheng Guan Five-Star People's Commune, and a live meeting of more than five hundred people was convened to exchange experiences, and then the financial clearing work was fully launched.

The county-wide financial clearing work started in mid-September and ended in mid-November. In the process of the work, the masses were fully mobilized, and the forms of big airing, big blooming, big debate, and big-character posters were adopted, and great achievements were made: the income and expenditure ledgers of the original two hundred and forty-four agricultural cooperatives were thoroughly cleared, the inventory of materials was checked, and new ledgers were re-established. Each commune achieved a clear understanding of income and expenditure. Financial institutions were established and improved, financial accounting personnel were equipped, and tasks were clarified. Practical democratic management, planned management, expenditure approval, accounting procedures, property custody, and usage systems, as well as production plans, financial income and expenditure plans, and revenue distribution plans, were formulated. Accounting units were determined, and hierarchical management was implemented. In addition, in the process of rectification, issues such as some agricultural cooperatives concealing grain and some cadres borrowing public funds indiscriminately were also dealt with, giving great education to all commune members.

Through the rectification, the financial management work of the eleven people's communes in the county has shown a new situation of satisfaction among leaders, satisfaction among commune cadres, and satisfaction among commune members. Commune member Li Jiangshun said: "The list is sent to the households, the income and expenditure are posted on the wall, the commune members are clear, and the enthusiasm for production is even greater."

    认真整顿公社财务工作  黎城调兵遣将发动群众  
    据山西日报消息  中共黎城县委调兵遣将，发动群众，认真的整顿公社财务管理工作。
    这个县实现人民公社化的初期，由于忽视整顿财务管理工作，加之政治思想工作没有及时赶上去，财务工作发生一些混乱现象。针对这种情况，中共黎城县委提出由书记挂帅，政治先行，进行整顿财务，并从粮食局、银行等企业单位，抽调了三十四名精通会计业务的干部，配合公社和原来农业社的四百七十余名财务会计工作人员，组成清理财务工作大军，分为一百多个小组，包干负责，进行清理。为了取得经验，事先在城关五星人民公社进行了试点，并召开了五百余人的现场会议，交流经验，然后把清理财务工作全面推开。
    全县清理财务工作，从9月中旬开始，到11月中旬结束。在工作过程中，充分发动群众，采取了大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的形式，取得了很大成绩：彻底清理了原来二百四十四个农业社的收支账簿，清点了库存物资，重新建立了账簿，各公社做到了收支有底。建立与健全了财务机构，配备了财务会计人员，明确了任务。制订出确实可行的民主管理、计划管理、开支审批、会计手续、财产保管、使用等制度，和生产计划、财务收支计划、收益分配计划。确定了核算单位，实行了分级管理。此外，在整顿过程中，还处理了有些农业社隐瞒粮食，有些干部乱借公款等问题，给全体社员以很大教育。
    通过整顿，全县十一个人民公社的财务管理工作，已经出现了领导满意、社干满意、社员满意的新局面。社员李江顺说：“清单送到户下，收支公布墙上，社员心明眼亮，生产劲头更大。”
