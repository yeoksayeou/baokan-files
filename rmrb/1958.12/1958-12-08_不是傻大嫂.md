    People call her a silly woman, but she starts work earlier than anyone else,
    Threshing wheat and pulling green grass, quick and of good quality.
    She works with great enthusiasm, and her hands and feet are nimble,
    Not a silly woman, but one with high awareness.
            (Sichuan Zhongjiang)

    不是傻大嫂
    人称傻大嫂，出工比谁早，
    打麦扯青草，速快质量好。
    做活干劲大，手脚也灵巧，
    不是傻大嫂，是她觉悟高。
            （四川中江）
