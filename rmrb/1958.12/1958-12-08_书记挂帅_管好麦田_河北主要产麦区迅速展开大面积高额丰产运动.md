    Secretaries Take the Lead, Manage Wheat Fields Well
    Major Wheat-Producing Areas in Hebei Province Rapidly Launch a Large-Scale, High-Yield Movement
    (Our report) Hebei Province's county and commune Party committees are advancing the large-scale, high-yield movement by assigning secretaries and committee members to take charge of fields.

    Currently, in major wheat-producing areas of Hebei Province, such as Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding prefectures, most county and commune Party committees have deployed forces, assigned personnel to specific areas, and appointed secretaries and committee members to take the lead, going deep into the front lines of production to strengthen leadership in the large-scale, high-yield movement. In Cangxian, Yongnian, and two other counties, 54 county Party secretaries and committee members and 534 commune Party secretaries and committee members are taking charge of the fields. In Nangong and Gaocheng counties, the number of production team branch secretaries and committee members specifically responsible for high-yield wheat fields reaches more than 3,500. According to understanding of these counties, on average, for every 100,000 mu of large-scale, high-yield wheat fields, there are five county Party committee members, fifty commune Party committee members, and one thousand grassroots branch committee members who delve into the fields to participate in and lead production. At the same time, some localities have also established specialized offices for the large-scale high-yield movement under the leadership of county, commune, and team Party organizations, to oversee all specific matters related to the movement. These secretaries or committee members who take charge of the fields generally personally work alongside cadres and commune members to discuss plans and measures, participate in planting and cultivation, and are responsible for leadership and harvests, seeing it through to the end. The provincial, prefectural, and county-level Party committees also keep track of the plans of county and commune Party committees for planting large-scale, high-yield fields and the lists of responsible Party committees, conducting regular inspections and evaluations.

    Due to the specific leadership of Party secretaries and committee members taking charge of the fields, Hebei Province's large-scale, high-yield movement is developing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from five prefectures (Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tianjin, and Tangshan) and Tianjin City, communes and teams have already cultivated more than 7.66 million mu of large-scale, high-yield wheat fields in connected areas, accounting for more than 27% of the winter wheat area in these regions, exceeding the original large-scale, high-yield field plan set by the Provincial Party Committee. The common characteristics of these high-yield wheat fields are: large size, advanced targets, careful cultivation, and dense, strong wheat seedlings. From the perspective of the high-yield wheat field situation in twelve counties of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, there are more than 1,200 large high-yield wheat fields of around 500 mu, of which more than 230 are over 1,000 mu. Many places have designated entire valleys and floodplains suitable for wheat planting, as well as both sides of railways and highways, as connected high-yield wheat field areas, with larger areas reaching tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of mu. These fields are all deeply ploughed, heavily fertilized, use improved seeds, and are rationally and densely planted, achieving standardization of sowing, regionalization of planting, and garden-like cultivation to varying degrees. The number of plants per mu has greatly increased compared to the past, generally close to one million, and in some cases exceeding one million. The planned yield per mu is generally 5,000 jin or more. Currently, these fields are being universally watered and top-dressed with fertilizer to strengthen management.

    In terms of labor organization, these fields have established specialized teams responsible for wheat field management work from planting to harvesting. Statistics from only Tianjin, Baoding, and Tangshan prefectures show that tens of thousands of specialized management teams for high-yield wheat fields have been organized. According to statistics from six counties including Cangxian and Nangong, among 1.27 million mu of large-scale high-yield fields, more than 130,000 professional team members have been fixed, with an average of one strong laborer responsible for managing every ten mu of high-yield wheat. Professional teams have generally implemented fixed tasks, quality, and completion times per person and per row. Currently, Party committees at all levels taking charge of the fields are combining the cultivation of a contingent of red and expert activists to help professional teams solve high-yield technical problems. In the professional teams of high-yield wheat fields in only three counties, Xingtai, Shexian, and others, 259 red and expert schools have been established, with over 22,000 students, who use on-site instruction and learn and do whatever is necessary to study and cultivate various technologies for high-yield wheat fields. Many high-yield wheat field areas have also established fertilizer bases. According to statistics from four counties, more than 2,200 new earthen fertilizer plants and a number of livestock sheds have been newly built on the land.

    At the same time, various localities are also starting to select plots of land, adjust land, vigorously carry out water conservancy construction, deep ploughing, and manure accumulation for next year's spring-sown crops in large-scale, high-yield fields. The planting plans for large-scale, high-yield fields of next year's spring-sown crops recently formulated by various prefectures have a total area of more than 19 million mu.

    The Hebei Provincial Party Committee believes that carrying out the large-scale, high-yield movement, implementing deep ploughing and careful cultivation, and reducing planting to increase harvesting, gradually transitioning to the "three-three system," is another major revolution in agricultural production. Party committees at all levels should fully value this movement and place it under the absolute leadership of the Party committee from beginning to end. The experience of various places in Hebei proves that in areas where this has been done, the large-scale, high-yield movement has developed rapidly and deeply. Anguo, Shexian, Gaocheng and other places have been closely grasping the large-scale, high-yield movement since the beginning of wheat planting, and the high-yield wheat fields are not only planted carefully, but also the field management activities such as checking seedlings and replanting, topdressing, and watering are carried out very timely, so the wheat seedlings are complete, strong, and prosperous. On the contrary, the Party committees of some counties and communes only regarded this movement as general work at the beginning, and simply engaged in discussing and researching and assigning numbers, and the secretaries did not personally start and grasp it firmly, which affected the timely development of the movement. At the beginning of wheat planting, the Party Committee of Nanying Commune in Gaocheng County only assigned the task of large-scale high-yield wheat fields to each production team, without designating a special person to be responsible for leadership, and many ideological and practical problems were not resolved in time, so the movement developed slowly. Later, the county party committee inspected and corrected this practice, and the commune assigned a party secretary to take the lead in the field, which accelerated the completion of the sowing task of high-yield wheat fields.

    In order to prevent wheat fields from being flooded, the Liantang Commune of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, dug drainage ditches two or three feet deep along the edges of the wheat fields, so that small ditches communicate with large ditches, and large ditches communicate with rivers, so that the water dries up after the rain and the fields do not accumulate water.

    This year, Changshu County is all broadcast wheat, which cannot be loosened and rooted to cover the mud. The county has adopted the method of directly spreading fine mud fertilizer for management, spreading 300 to 500 loads of mud fertilizer each time, which not only replenishes fertilizer, but also prevents frost and covers the exposed wheat. The picture shows the members of the Fourth Wheat Field Management Team of Liantang Commune spreading mud fertilizer.

    书记挂帅  管好麦田
    河北主要产麦区迅速展开大面积高额丰产运动
    本报讯  河北省县、公社党委正以书记、委员分头挂帅到田的方法，推动大面积高额丰产运动向前发展。
    目前，河北省主要麦产区邯郸、石家庄、保定等专区的多数县、公社党委已部署力量，定人包片，并由书记委员分别挂帅，深入生产第一线，加强对开展大面积高额丰产运动的领导。沧县、永年等四个县，即有五十四名县委书记和委员、五百三十四名公社党委书记和委员、挂帅到田。南宫、藁城两县，专责包丰产麦田的生产队支部书记和委员，达到三千五百多人。根据对这些县的了解，平均每十万亩大面积高额丰产麦田，就有五名县委、五十名公社党委委员和一千名基层支部委员，深入田间，参加生产领导生产。同时，有些地方还在县、社、队的党组织领导之下，建立了专门的大面积丰产运动的办事机构，主管有关开展运动的各项具体事宜。这些分头挂帅到田的书记或委员一般都亲自下手和干部社员一起讨论计划和措施，参加种植栽培，包领导，包收成，一包到底。省、地、县级党委还掌握县和公社党委种植大面积高额丰产田的计划和包干党委的名单，定期检查评比。
    由于党委书记、委员挂帅到田具体领导，河北省的大面积高额丰产运动发展很快。据邯郸、石家庄、保定、天津、唐山等五个专区和天津市的不完全统计，各社、队已培养起连片成方的大面积高额丰产麦田七百六十六万多亩，占这些地区冬麦田面积的27％以上，超过了省委原订的大面积高额丰产田计划。这些丰产麦田的共同特点是：块大、指标先进、耕作精细、麦苗密壮。从石家庄专区十二个县的丰产麦田情况来看，五百亩左右的大片丰产麦田共有一千二百多块，其中千亩以上的有二百三十多块。许多地方把适于种麦的整个山谷和泛区，以及铁路公路的两侧，划成连片丰产麦田区，较大的片的面积达几万亩，十几万亩。这些田都是翻地深，施肥多，使用良种，合理密植，不同程度地达到了播种规格化，种植区域化，耕作园田化。每亩现有株数比过去大大增多，一般近百万株，高的到百万株以上。计划每亩产量一般是五千斤以上。目前，这些田正普遍浇水追肥，加强管理。
    在劳动组织方面，这些田都建立了专业队，负责从种到收的麦田管理工作。只天津、保定、唐山三个专区统计，即组织了数以万计的丰产麦田专业管理队。据沧县、南宫等六县统计，在一百二十七万亩大面积高额丰产田当中，即固定了专业队员十三万多人，平均每十亩丰产小麦，就有一个壮劳力负责管理。专业队普遍实行了按人按垅固定任务、质量和完成时间。目前，各级到田挂帅的党委，正在结合着培养红专积极分子队伍，帮助专业队解决丰产技术问题。仅邢台、涉县等三县丰产麦田的专业队中就已建立起红专学校二百五十九处，学员人数达二万二千多人，他们用地头上课，作啥学啥的办法，研究培养丰产麦田的各种技术。不少丰产麦田区还建立了肥料基地。据四个县统计，就已新建二千二百多个土化肥厂和一批地头牲畜棚圈。
    与此同时，各地对明年春播作物大面积高额丰产田，也在着手进行选择地块，调整土地，大搞水利建设，深翻地和积肥。各专区最近制订的明年春播作物大面积高额丰产田的种植计划，总面积有一千九百多万亩。
    中共河北省委认为，开展大面积高额丰产运动，实行深耕细作，少种多收，逐步过渡到“三三制”，是农业生产上的又一次大革命。各级党委应充分重视这一运动，从始到终把运动置于党委的绝对领导下。河北各地的经验证明，凡是这样作了的地区，大面积高额丰产运动就开展的迅速深入。安国、涉县、藁城等地，从种麦开始起，一直对大面积高额丰产运动抓得很紧，丰产麦田不仅种的细致，而且查苗补苗、追肥、浇水等田间管理活动也进行的很及时，因此麦苗齐全壮旺，相反地，有些县、公社的党委，在开始时只把这一运动当作一般的工作，对讨论研究、分配数字等简单从事，书记也没有亲自下手狠抓，就影响了运动的及时开展。藁城县南营公社党委在种麦初期，只是向各生产队分配了大块丰产麦田的任务，没有指定专人负责领导，许多思想问题和实际问题没有得到及时解决，运动开展得很慢。后来由县委检查纠正了这种作法，公社抽出一名党委书记挂帅到田，才加速完成了丰产麦田的播种任务。

    常熟县今年全是撒播麦，不能松土壅根盖泥，全县采取了直接撒施碎细泥肥的办法管理，每次撒施泥肥三百——五百担，这样既追了肥，又防冻，复盖了露子麦。图是练塘公社第四麦田管理队的社员在撒施泥肥。
