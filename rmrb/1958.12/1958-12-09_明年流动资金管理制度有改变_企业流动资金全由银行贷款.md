    The Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China have agreed that, starting from January 1, 1959, the working capital required by state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises will be entirely resolved through bank loans. The working capital formerly allocated to these enterprises by the state will be fully transferred to the People's Bank of China as bank loans.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the production and operational tasks of various state enterprise departments have generally increased exponentially. The current working capital management system is no longer able to adapt to the needs of the actual situation. The current system is relatively complex, on the one hand dividing working capital into fixed and non-fixed quotas, with fixed quota funds determined by the finance departments and non-fixed quota funds provided by bank loans; on the other hand, fixed quota funds are further divided into financial allocations and bank loans. The finance departments, based on the enterprise's production and financial plans, determine the required working capital quota for a certain period (once a year or once every few years) and then make allocations accordingly. The main shortcomings of this approach are: the determination of the quota sometimes appears to be too high, sometimes too low, and after the determination it has to be approved and transmitted through various levels, often failing to meet the actual needs of the state enterprises.

    Implementing the new management method in the future will allow credit to be granted according to the actual needs of the state enterprises, providing more when needed and less when less is needed. In order to implement economic accounting and the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, state enterprises will first conduct careful calculations when applying for loans from state banks, using funds only when necessary and using as little as possible. This will ensure the timely supply of necessary working capital to state enterprises while maximizing the conservation of state working capital. In addition, the original method of financial allocation often involved the full allocation of funds to enterprises once the fixed quota funds were determined, either in one lump sum or in installments. If the enterprise did not need the funds immediately, it often resulted in idle or even wasteful phenomena. In the future, state enterprises, considering economic accounting, will only apply for credit from state banks when they actually need to use the funds. State banks will also need to understand the purpose of the funds required by the enterprises, which will reduce and avoid the idleness and waste of funds.

### 明年流动资金管理制度有改变  企业流动资金全由银行贷款

    明年流动资金管理制度有改变
    企业流动资金全由银行贷款
    新华社讯  财政部和中国人民银行商定：从1959年1月1日开始，国营、地方国营和公私合营企业所需要的流动资金，全部由银行贷款解决；过去由国家拨给这些企业的自有流动资金，全部转给中国人民银行作为银行贷款。
    大进跃以来，国家企业各部门生产、经营的任务，一般都是成倍地增长，现行的流动资金管理制度已显得不能适应实际情况的需要。现行制度比较复杂，一方面把流动资金分为定额和非定额两部分，定额资金由财政部门核定，非定额资金由银行贷款；另方面在定额资金中又分为财政拨款和银行贷款两部分。财政部门根据企业的生产和财务计划，于一定时期（一年一次或几年一次）核定所需要的流动资金定额，然后据以进行拨款。这种办法的主要缺点是：核定定额有时显得偏高，有时又显得偏低，而且核定后要经过层层批准下达，往往不能切合国家企业的实际需要。
    今后实行新的管理办法，就可以根据国家企业的实际需要办理信贷，该多即多，该少即少；国家企业为了执行经济核算制，贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，在向国家银行申请贷款时，必先经过精打细算，能不用即不用，能少用即少用。这样可以做到在最大限度地节约使用国家流动资金的原则下，保证及时供应国家企业必要的流动资金。另外，原来由财政部门拨款，往往是在核定定额资金之后，即一次或分次按照定额实足拨给企业，企业如果一时用不着，往往会发生闲置甚至浪费现象；今后国家企业从经济核算考虑，只有到实际使用资金的时候，才向国家银行办理信贷，国家银行也要了解企业所需资金的用途，这样就可以减少和避免资金的闲置和浪费现象。
