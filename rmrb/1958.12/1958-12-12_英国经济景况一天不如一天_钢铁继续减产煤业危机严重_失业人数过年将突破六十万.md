    British Economy Deteriorates Day by Day
    Steel Production Continues to Decline, Coal Industry Crisis is Severe
    Unemployment Will Exceed 600,000 After the New Year
    (Special dispatch from our London correspondent, December 11th) This reporter, Su Lan, reports: British industrial production continued to decline in November. According to official figures, this year's steel production will fall back four years, dropping to the level of 1955. The coal industry is experiencing its biggest crisis in thirty years.
    The average weekly steel production in November was 351,900 tons, significantly lower than the average production in October (363,500 tons). The average production in October was already 17% lower than the same period last year. Based on this figure, it is estimated that Britain produced a total of 17.9 million tons of steel in the first eleven months of this year. If production does not fall further in December, this year's steel production will only be over 19 million tons. Iron production has also declined sharply. Currently, the utilization rate of equipment in the steel industry is only 75%.
    Britain's coal production for the first forty-eight weeks of this year totaled 199.57 million tons. The same period last year was 207 million tons. It is estimated that this year's coal production will be equal to the level of 1931.
    Due to the sharp decline in domestic demand for coal from various industrial sectors and a drop in exports, coal stockpiles have increased dramatically. As of November 22nd, coal stocks had surged from 8,844,400 tons in the same period last year to 18,879,900 tons. Faced with this serious crisis, the British government has had to decide to close thirty-six mines. The coal sector has claimed that unless production is reduced, coal stocks will increase by another nine million tons by the end of next year. It is estimated that after these coal mines are closed, coal production next year will only be around 200 million tons. Even so, at least three million tons of coal will still be stockpiled next year.
    With the reduction in industrial production, the number of unemployed in Britain has increased by another 22,000 in the past month. As of November 17th, the number of unemployed in Britain had reached 533,000, equivalent to about 2.4% of the total employed population. This is an increase of 200,000 compared to December last year.
    The Minister of Labour recently stated that by the beginning of next year, the number of unemployed in Britain will reach 625,600.
    More seriously, these official figures do not include unemployed workers who are not registered with the government. For example, among dockworkers, the number of unregistered unemployed is higher than at any time in the past six years. Currently, unemployed dockworkers account for 15.3% of all dockworkers. If this type of unemployed worker is included, the total number of unemployed in Britain exceeds one million.
    The British government has recently taken various measures in an attempt to get rid of the increasingly approaching economic crisis. Domestically, it has repeatedly relaxed credit, removed restrictions on installment purchases of goods, and increased investment in "nationalized enterprises," etc. However, these practices cannot solve the fundamental problem and risk causing inflation.
    Externally, it is trying to increase exports and stimulate production. However, Britain's foreign markets are not expanding but shrinking. Affected by falling raw material prices, the purchasing power of Commonwealth countries and colonies has weakened significantly compared to the past, and Britain's exports to the Sterling Area have been declining. The establishment of the "Common Market" will inevitably affect Britain's exports to Western Europe.

    英国经济景况一天不如一天
    钢铁继续减产煤业危机严重
    失业人数过年将突破六十万
    本报伦敦11日专电  本报记者苏兰报道：英国工业生产在11月份继续下降。根据官方公布的数字核算，今年钢的产量将倒退四年，下降到1955年的水平。煤炭工业则经历着三十年来最大的危机。
    11月份钢的每周平均产量为三十五万一千九百吨，比10月份的平均产量（三十六万三千五百吨）又低了许多。而10月份的平均产量，已比去年同期下降了17％。根据这一数字推算，今年头十一个月，英国一共产钢一千七百九十万吨。如果12月份产量不再下跌，则今年的钢产量只有一千九百余万吨。铁的产量也急剧下降。目前，钢铁工业中的设备利用率只有75％。
    英国今年头四十八个星期的煤产量共一亿九千九百五十七万吨。去年同期则是二亿零七百万吨。估计今年煤的产量将等于1931年的水平。
    由于国内各工业部门对煤需求的锐减以及出口的下降，存煤大量堆积。截至11月22日止，存煤已由去年同期的八百八十四万四千吨猛增到一千八百八十七万九千吨。面临着这一严重危机，英国政府不得不决定关闭三十六个矿井。煤炭部门曾声称，除非降低生产，否则到明年年底存煤将再增加九百万吨。据估计，这些煤井关闭后，明年煤的产量只有二亿吨左右。即使如此，明年至少仍有三百万吨煤被堆积起来。
    随着工业生产的缩减，英国的失业人数在最近一个月中，又增加了二万二千人。截至11月17日，英国失业人数已达五十三万三千人，约等于全部就业人数的2.4％。比去年12月份增加了二十万人。
    最近劳工大臣曾声称，到明年年初，英国失业人数将达六十二万五千六百人。
    更严重的是，这些官方数字，并不包括那些未经政府注册的失业工人在内。以码头工人为例，未经登记的失业者，比六年来任何时期都多得多。现在，失业的码头工人占整个码头工人的15.3％。如果把这一类失业者计算在内，英国的失业总人数已逾百万。
    英国政府最近采取了各种措施，企图摆脱日益逼近的经济危机。在国内是屡次放宽信贷，取消对分期付款购买货物的限制，增加“国有化企业”的投资等等。但这种做法不能解决根本问题，并且有引起通货膨胀的危险。
    对外，则企图增加出口，刺激生产。但是，英国的国外市场不是在扩大，而是在缩小。联邦国家和殖民地受到原料价格下跌的影响，它们的购买力比过去大为减弱，英国对英镑区的出口，一直在下降。“共同市场”的建立，势必将影响英国对西欧的出口。
