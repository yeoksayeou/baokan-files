Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, December 13th -- According to TASS, the Finnish Communist Party Central Committee held a plenary session on December 13th and passed a resolution advocating the establishment of a new government based on democratic cooperation relying on the support of workers and small farmers.

The important tasks of the new government should be: to stabilize our country's international position on the basis of Finnish-Soviet friendly cooperation in accordance with the will of our peace-loving people, and the direction of economic activities should be such that foreign trade and economic policies help to increase employment opportunities and improve people's lives.

Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, December 15th -- Helsinki News: Finnish Communist Party Chairman Aaltonen delivered a report on the domestic and international situation and economic conditions of Finland at the plenary session of the Finnish Communist Party Central Committee held from the 13th to the 14th.

In his report, Aaltonen clarified the economic and political manifestations of the current crisis. He pointed out that in the first nine months of this year, Finland's industrial production decreased by 7% compared with the same period last year, construction in the third quarter decreased by 19%, retail trade in the first ten months of this year decreased by 4%, and wholesale trade decreased by 6%. The number of unemployed is nearly 80,000. The situation of workers, small landholders, small business owners, artisans, and merchants is also deteriorating. He said that all of this that the government has taken is aimed at increasing the profits of capitalists and worsening the situation of the working people.

Aaltonen pointed out that one of the important reasons for the economic crisis is the trade policy implemented by the Fagerholm government, which aimed to lean towards the West. Aaltonen said that due to the reduction of imports from socialist countries, exports to these countries are also declining.

Aaltonen finally pointed out that the Fagerholm government was forced to resign due to the warnings of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic League and the pressure of the masses. He called for the formation of a new Finnish government supported by workers and peasants, and called on the working people to be vigilant against the right-wing elements returning to power.

    芬共中央通过决议
    主张成立工农支持的政府
    芬共主席号召警惕右派再上台
    新华社14日讯  据塔斯社赫尔辛基13日讯：芬兰共产党中央委员会全体会议13日通过决议，主张在依靠工人和小农支持的民主合作的基础上成立新政府。
    新政府的重要任务应该是：根据我国爱好和平的人民的意志在芬苏友好合作的基础上稳定我国的国际地位，经济活动的方针要使对外贸易以及经济政策有助于增加就业机会和改进人民的生活。
    新华社15日讯  赫尔辛基消息：芬兰共产党主席阿尔托宁在13日到14日举行的芬兰共产党中央委员会全体会议上就芬兰国内外局势和经济情况作了报告。
    阿尔托宁在报告中阐明了目前的危机在经济和政治方面的表现。他指出，今年九个月来芬兰的工业生产比去年同一时期降低了7％，第三季度的建筑减少了19％，今年十个月来零售贸易缩减了4％，而批发贸易则缩减了6％，失业人数将近八万人。工人、小土地占有者、小企业主、手工业者和商人的处境也都趋于恶化。他说，政府所采取的这一切，目的是要提高资本家的利润，使劳动人民的处境恶化。
    阿尔托宁指出，造成经济危机的重要原因之一是法格霍姆政府所实行的目的在于倒向西方的贸易政策。阿尔托宁说，由于从社会主义国家的输入减少，向这些国家的输出也在下降。
    阿尔托宁最后指出，法格霍姆政府是由于共产党和人民民主联盟的警告以及群众的压力而被迫辞职的。他要求组成得到工人和农民支持的芬兰新政府，并且号召劳动人民警惕右翼分子重新上台。
