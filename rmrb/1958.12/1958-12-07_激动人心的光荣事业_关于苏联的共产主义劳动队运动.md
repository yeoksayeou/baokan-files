    An Exciting and Glorious Cause
    —On the Soviet Movement of Communist Labor Brigades
    Jun Qiang
    Khrushchev's report outline on the Seven-Year Plan, like a returning swallow, brought happiness, pride, and excitement to the Soviet people. Communism, which was once a fantasy, is becoming a reality, how could it not be exciting! When the Soviet people were enthusiastically discussing this outline, discussing how to move towards communism, they couldn't help but connect it to themselves, to their work and lives; thus, a great movement was launched, the movement of Communist Labor Brigades. The Soviet people regard this movement as a new development of what Lenin called a "great beginning."

    Heirs and Initiators
    In the Moscow marshalling station locomotive depot on the Moscow-Ryazan railway line, next to the roaring locomotive compartments, there is a room, a small museum. On the wall facing the entrance hangs a photograph, showing a group of elderly workers, the people who participated in the world's first "Communist Voluntary Saturday." About this photograph, there are a few simple introductions: In that severe May of 1919, the locomotive depot's Party branch decided to work overnight on Saturday to rush repair locomotives, working from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m. on Sunday morning. After the locomotives were repaired, all the party members who volunteered for unpaid labor drank tea in the carriage, discussing the situation on the Eastern Front, and singing the Internationale... What a heroic spirit! No wonder Lenin called their behavior a "great beginning."
    Almost forty years have passed since the "Communist Voluntary Saturday." The locomotive depot has undergone many changes. It now repairs powerful locomotives, and steam locomotives are being replaced by diesel and electric locomotives. But the revolutionary and creative tradition of the older generation of Communists has been inherited by the workers. A month ago, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union proposed convening the Twenty-First Congress to discuss the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan, the party members and young workers here thought that the country had entered a new stage of development, so what about individuals? Shouldn't they contribute more to communist construction? Shouldn't they improve themselves in all aspects to make themselves worthy of being members of communist society? In this way, the diesel locomotive repair workshop, this workshop of young people, decided to launch a communist competition.
    The significant Communist Labor Brigade was thus born. Let's take a look at their competition conditions.
    Reduce the time locomotives are out of service for repairs by eight to sixteen hours through automation and mechanization of the production process, improving workers' professional skills, and improving labor organization; save at least 60,000 rubles by the time of the 21st Congress of the CPSU through the adoption of rationalization proposals, saving materials, and improving labor organization; complete an eight-hour shift in seven hours! Each worker should submit at least one rationalization proposal per year; by the time of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, each worker should master a new specialty; help collective farms repair machines free of charge; spend eight hours of spare time each week helping construction workers build houses; train a group of middle school students to reach the level of third-grade fitters; and all the young workers in the workshop should reach the level of secondary or secondary specialized education within four or five years.
    The news of this communist competition spread like lightning across the Soviet Union, it touched the hearts of all laborers.

    Preparing to Enter Communism
    On the morning when the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan were published in the newspaper, the fifth and sixth mine shafts of the "Red Army Coal Mine" in Donbass were about to start using a new tunnel, which was equipped with the latest equipment and machinery. The advanced Shevelinov work team was given the glorious task of entering this tunnel to work. At this moment, the newspaper arrived. The Seven-Year Plan truly made the workers rejoice! On this very day, the Shevelinov work team set new and higher production targets, and at the same time decided to rename the work team the "Communist Labor Brigade." The workers said, we must prepare to enter communism, so we stipulate that all members of the team must at all times live up to the glorious title of member of the Communist Labor Brigade. This means consciously dedicating all our energy to the cause of communist construction and training ourselves and our comrades into people with communist virtues.
    The words of the work team leader Shevelinov spoke the minds of everyone, he said, "For us, labor is now not just a means of survival, but a need for physical and mental health, and a form of participation in the further development of society." The work team decided that everyone must study to improve their professional, cultural, and political levels. Each member must learn all the operations of the coal mining process, and each person can replace the work of others. Not studying is considered a manifestation of insufficient awareness and lack of self-respect. In addition, the guarantee conditions also stipulate that we must resolutely break away from the remnants of the old era, such as alcoholism, fooling around, and cursing. Anyone who violates these requirements is not worthy of being a member of the Communist Labor Brigade.

    Workers Want to Become Engineers
    The seventh Communist Youth League and Youth Blast Furnace of the famous Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union was the first work team in the Ural region to launch a competition to strive for the Communist Labor Brigade. This is not accidental. The young work team of the seventh blast furnace is famous throughout the factory, and their members are all production experts and good young people who are eager to learn. All the workers in the team have been insisting on amateur studies for several years. Technicians like Khabarov have entered specialized colleges for further studies after graduating from the youth worker school; and gas worker Gikov has entered the engineering college. This situation enables their work team's production level to be improved day by day. The young men are not only outstanding in production and study, but also impeccable in their lives. There was such an incident: On the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, someone from the factory management called the blast furnace to inquire about the production situation, and then casually asked: "Are there any drunken people in your work team today?" This made the gas worker Zilin who answered the phone angry. He replied, "Comrade, you've come to the wrong place."
    Today, this excellent work team has taken the lead in participating in the ranks of the Communist Labor Brigade competition. They put forward the slogan: We want all members of the team to become engineers when entering communism.

    Tractor Drivers' Code of Conduct
    The second tractor work team of the Frunze Collective Farm in the Altai Territory, after serious and conscientious discussion, responded to the initiative of the industrial workers, resolutely participated in the communist competition, and formulated ten codes of conduct. These young tractor drivers decided to increase yield per unit area, save funds, and extend the life of the machines. To achieve this, it is first necessary to improve professional skills and political awareness. Therefore, one of their codes of conduct is: to treat the machine with the attitude of a master. You must truly regard the tractor as your own pen or bicycle to be called a member of the Communist Labor Brigade.
    The tractor drivers also decided to set up an unattended vending area in the work team, build clubs, open libraries, and green the work area through voluntary labor. In short, they should always consider the interests of the collective and do more for the collective. Tractor driver Peter said it well, "I" and "mine" are remnants of the old era, and "we" and "ours" are what is needed to build communism.
    As for life, the young men decided to abolish the practice of drinking and celebrating after the spring sowing and autumn harvest are completed. They said, why can't we hold sports meets to celebrate instead of drinking? Although this is a matter for the entire collective farm, they believe that influencing the people around them is the duty of the Communist Labor Brigade, so they also discussed this matter enthusiastically.

    The slogan of working, studying, and living in a communist way quickly spread throughout the Soviet Union. Participating in the movement of the Communist Labor Brigade has become a glorious cause that excites every worker in the Soviet Union. Both workers and farmers said boldly, well, let us compete to prepare to enter communism! As for the initiator of this movement, the young workers of the diesel locomotive repair workshop of the Moscow locomotive depot, they have now been formally granted the glorious title of "Communist Labor Workshop" by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League. All the workers of this locomotive depot have now further proposed the slogan of striving for a "Communist Labor" locomotive depot. (Attached picture)

    激动人心的光荣事业
    ——关于苏联的共产主义劳动队运动
    君强
    赫鲁晓夫关于七年计划的报告提纲，像是一只春燕，给苏联人民带来幸福、自豪和激动。曾经是幻想的共产主义正在变为现实，怎能不令人激动呢！苏联人在热烈讨论这个提纲时，在讨论如何向共产主义迈进时，不由得就联系到了他们自己，联系到他们的工作和生活；于是掀起了一个伟大的运动，共产主义劳动工作队的运动。苏联人民把这个运动看作是列宁称之为“伟大的创举”的新发展。
    继承者和发起者
    在莫斯科一梁赞铁路线莫斯科调车站机车库里，在轰响着的车间隔壁有一间屋子，这是一个不大的博物馆。迎门的墙上挂着一张像片，上面是一群上了年纪的工人，这是参加世界上第一个“共产主义义务星期六”的人们。关于这张像片，有几行简单的介绍：在那严峻的1919年5月，机车库党支部决定星期六连夜工作，赶修机车，从晚八时一直工作到星期日的清晨六点钟。当机车修理好以后，全体自愿义务劳动的党员到车厢里喝茶，讨论东部战线的局势，一边唱起国际歌……多么豪迈的气概！无怪乎列宁把他们的行为称作“伟大的创举”。
    从“共产主义义务星期六”到现在已经快四十年了。机车库已经发生了许多变化。这里现在修理的是强大的机车，而且蒸汽机车正在为内燃机车和电气机车所代替。但是老一代共产党人的革命的创造性传统，却被工人们继承了下来。一个月前，当苏联共产党提出召开第二十一次代表大会讨论七年计划的控制数字时，这里的党团员和青年工人们便想到，国家已迈入新的发展阶段，那么个人怎样呢？不是应当为共产主义建设多出些力吗？不是应当在各方面提高自己，使自己堪称共产主义社会的一员吗？就这样，内燃机车修理车间，这个青年人的车间，决定展开共产主义竞赛。
    意义重大的共产主义劳动工作队就这样诞生了。让我们来看看他们的竞赛条件吧。
    用生产过程自动化和机械化、提高工人业务水平、改进劳动组织的办法，把机车因修理而停驶的时间减少八至十六小时；通过采用合理化建议，节约材料和改善劳动组织，到苏共第二十一次代表大会召开时，至少节约六万卢布；一班八小时的工作，用七小时完成！每一工人一年至少提出一项合理化建议；到苏共第二十一次代表大会召开时，每一工人要掌握一项新的专业；帮助集体农庄义务修理机器；每周用八小时业余时间帮助建筑职工住宅；培养一批中学生，让他们达到三级钳工的水平；车间全体青年工人在四五年之内达到具有中等或中等专业教育的水平。
    这个共产主义竞赛的消息，像闪电一样迅速传到全苏各地，它打动了所有劳动者的心。
    为进入共产主义作好准备
    在报纸上发表七年计划控制数字的那天清晨，顿巴斯“红军煤矿”的第五、六号矿井，正是要开始动用一个新坑道的时候，这里安装了最新的设备和机器。先进的谢维利诺夫工作队得到了进入这个坑道工作的光荣任务。正在这时，报纸来到了。七年计划真使工人们心花怒放啊！就在这一天，谢维利诺夫工作队定出了新的更高的生产任务，同时决定把工作队改名为“共产主义劳动工作队”。工人们说，我们要为进入共产主义做好准备，因此我们规定全队所有工人时时刻刻不负共产主义劳动工作队队员的光荣称号。这就是说，为共产主义建设事业自觉地拿出全付精力，把自己和同志都锻炼成具有共产主义品德的人。
    工作队长谢维利诺夫的话，说出了大家的心思，他说，“对我们来说，劳动现在已不只是生存的手段，而是身体和精神上的需要，是参加社会进一步发展的形式。”工作队决定每人都要学习，提高业务水平、文化水平和政治水平。每个队员要学会采煤过程的全部操作，每人都能代替别人的工作。不学习被认为是觉悟不够和不自重的表现。此外，保证条件还规定坚决同旧时代的残余，像酗酒、胡闹、骂街等割断关系。谁破坏了这些要求，谁就不配作共产主义劳动工作队的队员。
    工人要成为工程师
    苏联著名的马格尼托格尔斯克钢铁厂七号共青团和青年高炉，是乌拉尔地区掀起争取共产主义劳动工作队竞赛的第一个工作队。这不是偶然的。七号高炉的青年工作队是全厂闻名的，他们的队员个个都是生产能手，而且是学而不倦的好青年。全队工人几年来一直坚持着业余学习，像技师哈巴罗夫从青年工人学校毕业后已进入专科学院深造；瓦斯工吉科夫入了工学院。这种情况，使他们工作队的生产水平能够日益提高。小伙子们不仅生产和学习出色，在生活上也是无可挑剔的。曾有这样一件事：在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年的那一天，工厂经理处有人给高炉来电话询问生产情况，然后还顺便问了句：“你们工作队今天有没有喝醉了的？”这一下可把接电话的瓦斯工日林问得发火了。他回答说，“同志，你问错了地方。”
    如今，这个优秀的工作队率先参加了共产主义劳动工作队竞赛的行列。他们提出口号说：我们要在进入共产主义时全体队员都成为工程师。
    拖拉机手的守则
    阿尔泰边疆区伏龙芝集体农庄第二拖拉机工作队，经过严肃认真的讨论，响应了产业工人的倡议，毅然地参加了共产主义竞赛，订出了十项守则。这些青年拖拉机手们决定要提高单位面积产量、节约资金、延长机器的寿命。为了作到这一点，首先要提高业务水平和政治觉悟。因此，他们的守则之一是：要以主人翁的态度对待机器。必须真正把拖拉机看作是你自己的钢笔或自行车一样，才能称为是共产主义劳动工作队的一员。
    拖拉机手们还决定在工作队设立一个无人售货处，用义务劳动修建俱乐部、开办图书馆、绿化工作地点等，总之，要处处考虑集体的利益，为集体多做些事。拖拉机手彼德说的好，“我”和“我的”，这都是旧时代的残余，“我们”和“我们的”，这才是建设共产主义所需要的。
    至于在生活方面，小伙子们决定废除在春播和秋收完成后畅饮庆祝的作法。他们说，为什么不可以举行运动会来庆祝而非要喝酒呢？虽然这是整个农庄的事，但是他们认为，影响周围的人是共产主义劳动工作队的义务，因此，他们也热烈地讨论了这件事。
    以共产主义方式来工作、学习和生活的口号，很快地飞遍了苏联全国。参加共产主义劳动工作队的运动，在苏联已成为激动着每一个劳动者的光荣事业。无论工人和农民都豪放地说，好吧，让我们为准备进入共产主义而竞赛吧！至于这个运动的发起者，莫斯科机车库内燃机车修理车间的青年工人们，现在已经得到苏联共青团中央正式赋予它的“共产主义劳动车间”的光荣称号。这个机车库的全体工人现在已进一步提出争取“共产主义劳动”机车库的口号。（附图片）
    这就是共产主义竞赛的发起者、莫斯科调车站机车库的青年工人。
