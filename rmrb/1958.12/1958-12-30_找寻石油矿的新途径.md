Scientific Developments

    The Songnen Soil Team of the Heilongjiang Scientific Expedition, under the guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Yegorov, discovered that the salt in the soda saline-alkali soil of Northeast China comes from underground oil water. Based on the nature and distribution of the saline-alkali soil, the buried range of oil can be indicated.

    Northeast China's soda saline-alkali soil is a special kind of saline-alkali soil with high alkalinity, poor soil physical properties, and difficult water penetration, making it impossible to improve with general flushing methods. At the summary meeting of the Heilongjiang Scientific Expedition last year, Academician-Correspondent Kovda proposed that soda saline-alkali soil might be related to oil water. In this year's investigation, everyone boldly hypothesized that the key to the problem lies in the source of salt, and designed the investigation route based on this assumption. During the investigation in Anda County, pressurized groundwater containing a small amount of soda was discovered. Relevant information was collected in Lindian Baichengzi and Guoqian Banner. After a field rush analysis, it was shown that all these groundwater and rocks contain soluble salts, and most of them are soda (referring to sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate). It was then determined that the source of salt in the surface saline-alkali soil is caused by soda-containing oil water. Soda-containing oil water flows out of the surface through springs, or rises to the surface due to the action of confined pressure or capillary action, and the salt accumulates as water evaporates, forming saline-alkali soil.

    The significance of solving the problem of salt source is not only that the improvement of saline-alkali soil can be targeted, but also that the buried range of oil can be inferred according to the distribution of this kind of saline-alkali soil, so that the soil can serve industrial production.

    The facts of this investigation show that on the southern terrace of Guoqian Banner, ring-shaped soda saline-alkali soil is distributed in the marginal area. Based on its special salt nature and distribution, it can be speculated that there is oil buried in this area, and the area of ​​oil is roughly the same as the circular ring formed by the saline-alkali soil, and it is buried in the circular ring.

    The field analysis data show that this inference is correct. All this shows that finding oil based on the principles of geochemistry and the distribution of special saline-alkali soils is a new approach with great theoretical and practical significance.

    找寻石油矿的新途径
    黑龙江科学考察队松嫩土壤小队，在苏联专家叶果洛夫同志指导下，发现东北苏打盐土的盐分是来自地下的石油水，根据盐土的性质和分布情况，可以指示出石油埋藏范围。
    东北苏打盐土是一种特殊的盐土，碱性大，土壤物理性质不良，水分渗透困难，不能用一般冲洗方法来改良。在去年黑龙江科学考察队的总结会上，柯夫达通讯院士曾提出了苏打盐土可能与石油水有关。在今年的调查工作中，大家大胆假定问题的关键在于盐分来源，并根据这个设想设计了调查路线。在安达县进行调查时，发现了含有少量苏打的承压地下水。在林甸白城子和郭前旗等地都曾收集到有关的资料。经过野外的突击分析以后，说明所有这些地下水和岩石都含有可溶性盐，并且极大部分为苏打（指碳酸钠和重碳酸钠）。于是认定：地表盐土的盐分来源是由含苏打的石油水引起的。含有苏打的石油水，借着泉水流出地表，或由于承压作用或毛细管作用上升地表，水分蒸发，盐分积聚便形成盐土。
    盐分来源问题获得解决的意义，不仅对盐土改良可以对症下药，同时按这种盐土的分布情况，可以推断出石油埋藏范围，使土壤为工业生产服务。
    此次调查的事实说明：在郭前旗南部台地上，边缘地区有成环状的苏打盐土分布。根据其特殊的盐分性质和分布情况，可以推测出在这一地区有石油埋藏，石油的面积大致和盐土相联而成的圆形环相同，并埋藏在圆形环之中。
    野外的分析资料说明，这种推断是正确的。这一切表明：根据地球化学原理，按特殊的盐土分布情况来寻找石油，是具有很大理论上和实用上意义的新途径。
