    Every Plot of Wheat Field is Managed
    (Our report) "Don't let three types of wheat seedlings overwinter" is the action slogan of the broad masses of farmers in Henan Province in their current management of wheat fields. Now, more than a thousand people's communes across the province are actively taking action, conducting universal inspections, categorizing wheat seedlings, and carrying out processing management according to the different growth conditions of wheat to lay a solid foundation for achieving a greater wheat harvest next year.
    This year, Henan Province had high-quality wheat sowing, with land deeply ploughed to more than one foot and more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu. Some people believe that this year's wheat seedlings are growing well and do not require any management. The Party committees in various localities inspected the wheat fields based on this situation. According to the inspection, many wheat fields are still far from meeting the requirements. In Nanyang, Xinyang and other special districts, first-class seedlings account for 60%, second-class seedlings account for 30%, and third-class seedlings account for 10%. It is urgent to improve second-class seedlings and eliminate third-class seedlings before the ground freezes. To this end, the Party committees in various localities have established special wheat management organizations and designated special personnel to be responsible for leadership. In Xuchang County, two deputy secretaries of the county party committee are in charge of two large areas, and eleven members of the county party committee are contracted to various communes by area. Wheat field management headquarters have been established from the county to the township level, responsible for leading wheat field management. Under the leadership of this wheat field headquarters, various communes have established a large number of wheat management professional teams, with 3.6 million people participating in wheat field management. After replanting 1.46 million mu of wheat with missing seedlings, they launched a manure accumulation and delivery campaign. Generally, 20,000 jin of top dressing fertilizer has been applied to wheat fields. In addition to accumulating coarse fertilizer, various localities are also using local methods to produce a large amount of fine fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics, more than 100,000 local chemical fertilizer plants and granular fertilizer plants have been built throughout the province.

    块块麦田有人管理
    本报讯  “不让三类麦苗过冬”这是河南省广大农民当前管理麦田的行动口号。现在，全省一千多个人民公社，积极采取行动，普遍检查，麦苗站队，根据小麦生长不同情况进行加工管理，为明年实现小麦更大丰收打下有力基础。
    河南省今年小麦播种质量高，土地深翻一尺以上，亩施底肥一万斤以上。有些人认为今年麦苗长的好，不需要什么管理就行了。各地党委根据这一情况对麦田进行了检查。根据检查来看，不少麦田距离要求还很远，南阳、信阳等专区一类苗占60％，二类苗占30％，三类苗占10％，急需在上冻以前，提高二类苗，消灭三类苗。为此，各地党委建立了小麦管理专门机构，确定专人负责领导。许昌县，两个县委副书记分管两大片，十一个县委委员分片包干各个公社。从县到乡都成立麦田管理指挥部，负责领导麦田管理工作。在这种小麦指挥部的领导下，各公社建立了大批的小麦管理专业队，有三百六十万人参加麦田管理，他们补完一百四十六万亩缺苗小麦以后，又开展了一个积肥送粪运动，一般麦田已上追肥两万斤。除积粗肥外，各地还大量用土法制造细肥。据不完全统计，全省已建土化肥厂、颗粒肥厂十万多个。
