    Agricultural Meteorological Conditions for Safe Overwintering of Winter Wheat
    Dong Guang
    The natural disasters that winter wheat may encounter in winter and early spring are mainly frost damage. The occurrence of frost damage is closely related to the variety characteristics, growth status, agricultural technology measures of winter wheat itself, as well as the severity of the cold and sudden changes in temperature during the winter and spring. Strong winds and inappropriate moisture levels can also harm winter wheat in winter, but they are often combined with frost damage.
    
    Reasons for Winter Wheat Suffering Frost Damage
    Low temperature is the main reason for wheat suffering frost damage. There are two situations that cause frost damage to wheat: one is mechanical damage, mainly due to ice formation in the intercellular spaces at low temperatures, which generates mechanical pressure on the cell walls, damaging tissues, and also due to sudden changes in temperature, with excessive moisture in the soil undergoing repeated freezing and thawing. Because water expands when it freezes, it breaks the root system of the wheat. The other situation is that under the influence of low temperature, ice forms within the intercellular spaces of plant cells, and water flows out of the protoplasm, causing cell dehydration, which damages the protoplasm, leading to cell death. The death of cells causes the death of some organs or the entire plant of the wheat. The temperature at which this type of frost damage occurs varies with the wheat's growth stage. During severe cold, before the wheat jointing, the main organ—the tillering node—can generally withstand temperatures of -12° to -15° Celsius. As spring approaches, the temperature rises, and after the wheat goes through the vernalization stage, its cold resistance gradually decreases. After jointing, temperatures slightly below zero can cause frost damage to stems and leaves. It can be seen that both the severe cold of winter and the excessively late spring frosts are harmful to wheat.
    
    Pre-Winter Hardening Can Cultivate the Cold Resistance of Wheat Seedlings
    The cold resistance of wheat seedlings mainly depends on the ratio of sugar and water content in their bodies. The more sugar content, the less likely the water in the tissues is to freeze, and thus the more cold-resistant it is. Conversely, the less sugar content, the weaker the cold resistance. Starch in plants can be converted into sugar, and this conversion process mainly changes with temperature. When the temperature is low (around 0-15°) and gradually decreases, starch is converted into sugar. However, when the temperature is high (above 15° or so) and gradually increases, sugar will gradually be consumed by respiration.
    
    It can be seen that a slightly longer period of lower temperature hardening before the onset of severe cold can cultivate the cold resistance of wheat seedlings.
    
    The best time to harden winter wheat's cold resistance is after tillering, because at this time the leaf surface is already larger, and the root system is relatively developed, allowing it to absorb more nutrients and carry out vigorous photosynthesis, which can produce and accumulate a large amount of sugar.
    
    Good agricultural meteorological conditions for hardening winter wheat's cold resistance are: sufficient sunshine, daytime maximum temperature around 10-15°, nighttime minimum temperature around zero, and moderate soil moisture (around 25% of the dry soil weight is better for sandy loam). It is better to maintain these conditions for five days or more. With these conditions, winter wheat can fully carry out photosynthesis during the day, and because the temperature is low at night and respiration is weak, less nutrients are consumed, so it can accumulate a large amount of sugar.
    
    If there are several consecutive days of cloudy and rainy weather, high temperatures, and small temperature ranges before the onset of severe winter, then the previously accumulated sugar will be quickly consumed due to increased respiration, which will reduce the cold resistance of the wheat seedlings.
    
    Wheat seedlings that have undergone good hardening at lower temperatures can resist increasingly low severe cold. Of course, the strength of cold resistance is also related to the variety of winter wheat. Winter wheat varieties have strong cold resistance, and spring wheat varieties have weak cold resistance. Vigorous growth of wheat seedlings and good root development before winter are also factors that can withstand low temperatures.
    
    Several Factors Affecting the Intensity of Winter Wheat Frost Damage
    Strong winds In wheat fields with relatively dry and loose soil or poor land preparation, with large clods, large cracks, and shallow seed covering, strong winds can accelerate soil air exchange or expose the tillering nodes of winter wheat to the air. The tillering nodes, without the protection of the soil, are extremely susceptible to frost damage. Windy areas in river valleys are most susceptible to this type of frost damage.
    
    Snow cover Snow is a poor conductor of heat and has an insulating effect. If snowfall reaches a depth of about one foot before severe cold, then even if the temperature drops to -30°, winter wheat will not suffer frost damage. A certain depth of snow cover not only maintains the soil temperature from dropping too low, protecting winter wheat from frost damage, but also fully supplies the water needed by winter wheat when spring comes. The overall result is to advance the green-up of winter wheat and increase the number of effective tillers. However, it should also be known that excessively early, thick, and persistent snow cover can also bring snow damage to winter wheat. When the ground surface just begins to freeze in early winter, a heavy snowfall covers the ground thickly. Because the temperature in the ground is higher than that on the surface, heat is transmitted upward, and later the ground surface and the snow cover close to the ground surface thaw, which makes the soil moist and easily suffocates the wheat seedlings. And the temperature remains at around zero degrees Celsius, causing the strengthening of winter wheat's respiration, which gradually consumes the sugar accumulated from autumn, greatly weakening its cold resistance. This phenomenon is usually called snow damage. Snow damage is often accompanied by fungal diseases (snow mold, sclerotinia), which ultimately result in a large number of winter wheat deaths. In China's major winter wheat regions, there is rarely prolonged snow cover in winter, and snow damage rarely occurs. The main measures to prevent snow damage are to compact the snow, increase the thermal conductivity of the snow cover, and reduce the temperature of the soil surface layer. Spreading a layer of coal ash on the snow to promote gradual melting of the upper part of the snow and increase the density of the snow can also achieve the same purpose.
    
    Sudden temperature changes in early spring After the end of winter, the weather warms up. In areas with excessively moist soil, if the warming is rapid and the temperature rises very high at the beginning, but the frozen soil underground does not have time to thaw, this first causes the upper part of the winter wheat to begin to activate, urgently needing water and nutrient supply. However, the roots cannot activate due to the low temperature or still being frozen, making it difficult to absorb water and nutrients. As a result, the wheat seedlings will wither due to physiological drought caused by insufficient water and nutrient supply, and may even cause death in severe cases. In this case, if the soil thaws quickly, and if the damage to the wheat seedlings is not significant, the cold resistance will also decrease rapidly. If another cold wave comes later and re-freezes the excessively moist soil, because the volume of water expands when it freezes, it will break the root system of winter wheat. Then, the repeated thawing and freezing will loosen the soil, making it extremely easy to expose the tillering nodes on the soil surface. In this case, the cold resistance of the wheat seedlings has already decreased, and the exposed tillering nodes will easily be damaged by frost. In order to prevent or reduce this frost damage, drainage ditches should be opened before sowing, especially in low-lying areas, areas with shallow groundwater levels, or areas with high winter precipitation. The drainage ditches should be opened deeper to reduce excessive moisture in the cultivation layer, reduce the pulling force when the soil freezes, and reduce the loosening of the soil. Secondly, at the beginning of freezing in early winter, cover the wheat seedlings with a layer of manure or peat of appropriate thickness to reduce the depth of soil freezing and make it thaw quickly, so that root activity starts earlier. But it should be noted that it should not be covered too early or too thick, otherwise, it will weaken the cold resistance of the wheat seedlings.
    
    Poor land preparation, such as large clods, uneven ground, too shallow or uneven sowing depth, are all likely to expose the tillering nodes to the soil surface or too close to the lowest temperature point on the ground surface, thus making them susceptible to frost damage. Winter and spring rolling is to compact the surface soil, eliminate cracks, prevent tillering nodes from being exposed, and can play a good role in frost prevention. Irrigating frozen water before the ground surface is about to freeze in early winter can delay the decrease of surface soil temperature and make the soil temperature drop steadily, thereby prolonging the effective tillering period of winter wheat before winter and enhancing its cold resistance. Generally, wheat fields that have been irrigated with frozen water thaw later in spring (about a week later than those that have not been irrigated with water). Therefore, it is best to irrigate with returning green water in early spring (in North China, it is appropriate during the period from Rain Water to the Vernal Equinox) when the daily average temperature is roughly stable at 1-6°C, so that the lower layer of soil thaws earlier and the upper layer of soil temperature rises steadily, which can also play a certain role in preventing frost damage. In addition, applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to wheat seedlings before winter can also enhance the cold resistance and resistance to late spring frost of wheat seedlings.
    
    Agricultural Meteorological Conditions for Winter Wheat Growth This Year
    This year, China's wheat fields generally have been deep-plowed to more than one foot, with more than 30,000 jin of base fertilizer applied, and the sowing amount has reached 30 jin per mu. Because the meteorological departments in various places have made forecasts for the suitable sowing period of winter wheat, most wheat fields have been sown in a timely manner. A small number of wheat fields were sown slightly later because of tight labor this autumn and high requirements for cultivation quality. In the middle of October and November, the main winter wheat areas in China—the Huanghuai River Basin—generally had two penetrating rains. These have laid the foundation for good growth of wheat seedlings before winter. Deep plowing and applying more base fertilizer can raise the ground temperature by about 2°, which has the effect of promoting wheat seedling growth and can compensate for the shortcomings of some wheat fields being sown slightly later.
    
    Since the second half of this year, the temperature in various parts of China has generally been lower than in normal years, and winter has also come earlier. Since the end of November, the temperature in most parts of northern China has begun to change higher than in normal years. Currently (early December), the weather in the Huanghuai River Basin is relatively warm, with sufficient sunshine, few days of strong winds, and generally moderate soil moisture, which is conducive to winter wheat tillering and cold resistance training before overwintering.
    
    According to the existing materials, except for some areas in western Henan and Hebei provinces where wheat seedlings are still in the three-leaf stage, the rest have begun to tiller, and the wheat seedlings are generally growing well. It is estimated that wheat seedlings in these areas can generally reach more than one to two tillers before growth stops.
    
    Many areas south of the Yangtze River Basin were sown later, and most are still in the emergence stage. The areas south of the Nanling Mountains and east of eastern Guangxi have not had a penetrating rain for more than two months, which has affected sowing. Currently, the temperature in these areas is still lower than in normal years, but because the winter temperature is very high in these areas, wheat seedlings generally do not stop growing, so the pre-winter growth is generally not as important as in the north.
    
    Although winter came early this year and was relatively cold before winter, judging from the current trend, winter in most parts of China this year will not be much colder than in normal years, and spring next year may come earlier than in normal years. Such weather conditions are conducive to the safe overwintering of winter wheat.

    冬小麦安全过冬的农业气象条件
    东光
    冬小麦在冬季和春季前期可能遭到的自然灾害主要是冻害，而冻害的发生是与冬小麦本身品种特性、生育状况、农业技术措施以及冬春不同期间严寒的程度和冷暖的骤变密切相关的。大风和不适量的水分也能在冬季为害冬小麦，但往往是与冻害相结合的。
    冬小麦遭受冻害的原因
    低温是使小麦遭受冻害的主要原因。造成小麦冻害有两种情况：一种是机械损伤，这主要是由于在低温下细胞间隙结冰，产生对细胞壁的机械压力，破坏组织，以及由于冷暖骤变，土壤中存在过多的水分一融一冻，因为水结冰时体积膨大，结果把小麦的根系拉断。另一种情况是在低温影响下植物细胞间隙内发生结冰，水从原生质流出造成细胞脱水，结果原生质遭到破坏，因而细胞死亡。细胞的死亡引起小麦部分器官或者全部植株的死亡。发生这种冻害情况温度的高低是随小麦发育期而不同，在严寒期间小麦未拔节以前的主要器官——分蘖节一般能耐摄氏－12°至－15°的低温，随着春天来临，气温升高，小麦经过春化阶段后耐寒的能力逐渐降低，到拔节以后，稍低于零度的温度就能使茎叶发生冻害。可见，冬季的严寒和春季过迟的晚霜冻都是对小麦有害的。
    冬前锻炼可以培养麦苗的抗寒能力
    麦苗对低温的抵抗能力主要决定于其体内糖分和水分含量的比例。糖分含量愈多，组织内的水分愈不容易冻结，因而就愈能抗寒。相反，糖分含量愈少，抗寒性愈弱。植物体内淀粉能转化为糖，这种转化的过程主要是随温度而改变的，当温度较低（0—15°左右）并逐渐下降时，淀粉就转化为糖。但当气温较高（15°左右以上）并逐渐升高时，糖就会渐渐地被呼吸消耗着。
    由此可见，在严寒来临之前，稍长时期较低温度的锻炼是能培养麦苗的抗寒能力的。
    锻炼冬小麦的抗寒能力最好是在分蘖以后，因为这时候叶面已较大，根系也比较发达，能更多地吸收养分，进行颇为强盛的光合作用，可以大量地制造并积储糖类物质。
    锻炼冬小麦抗寒能力的良好农业气象条件是，充足的日照，白天最高温度在10—15°左右，夜间最低温度在零度上下，土壤水分适中（砂壤土内水分占干土重25％左右较好）。保持这种条件的天气达五天以上，并且越长越好。有了这些条件冬小麦白天能充分地进行光合作用，而在夜间因气温低，呼吸弱，消耗养料少，因而能大量地积累糖分。
    要是在严冬来临之前一连好几天阴雨，气温高，而且变幅小，那么以前所积累的糖分很快便为呼吸加强而消耗，结果就降低了麦苗的抗寒能力。
    经过较低温度良好锻炼过的麦苗，便能抵抗愈来愈低的严寒。当然，抗寒能力的强弱也与冬小麦品种有关，冬性品种抗寒能力强，春性品种抗寒能力弱。冬前麦苗生长茁壮、根系发育良好也是能耐低温的一个因素。
    影响冬小麦冻害强度变化的几个因素
    大风  在土壤比较干旱疏松或整地不良，土块多、裂缝大、种子复土浅的麦地，大风能加速土壤空气交换或使冬小麦的分蘖节暴露空中。分蘖节得不到土壤的保护就极易被冻坏。川道风口地最易受到这种冻害。
    积雪  雪是不良导体，具有保温的作用，如果在严寒之前降雪达一尺左右的深度，那么，即使气温降到零下30°，也不致使冬小麦遭到冻害。一定深度的积雪不但能保持地温不致下降过低，使冬小麦免受冻害，而且在春天来临时能充分供给冬小麦所需的水分，总的结果是能提早冬小麦返青，增加有效分蘖数。但是也应知道，过早过厚持久的积雪也会给冬小麦带来雪害的。当冬初地表刚开始冻结时，一场大雪把大地厚厚地盖住后，由于地中温度比地表的高，热量往上传，后来地表和贴近地表的积雪都解冻了，这就使得土壤潮湿，容易使麦苗受到窒息，而气温一直保持在零度左右，造成冬小麦呼吸作用的加强，从而逐渐地把从秋季积累的糖分消耗掉，大大地削弱其抗寒的能力，这种现象通常叫做雪害。伴随雪害的常是真菌病害（雪霉菌、菌核病），其最后结果是造成冬小麦大量的死亡。我国主要冬小麦地区冬季很少长久积雪，雪害一般很少发生。防止雪害的主要措施是将雪压紧，增大积雪的导热率，以降低土壤表层的温度。在雪上撒一层煤灰，促使积雪上部逐渐融化，使雪的密度增大，也能达到同样的目的。
    春初寒暖骤变  冬末以后天气回暖，在土壤过分潮湿地区，如果回暖迅速，一开始气温就升得很高，而地下冻土来不及解冻，这首先使得冬小麦上部开始活动，急需水分和养料供给，但根部因气温低或者仍在冻结，不能活动，难以吸收水分和养料，于是麦苗便会因水分和养料供应不上发生生理干旱而枯萎，严重时甚至引起死亡。在这种情况下，如果土壤迅速解冻，要是麦苗受到的损害不大，抗寒能力也是会迅速降低的。以后如果再来一次大寒潮，重新使过分潮湿的土壤冻结，由于水结冰会使体积膨大，从而拉断冬小麦的根系，那么一融一冻就使土壤松动，极易把分蘖节暴露在土壤表面。在这种情况下麦苗的抗寒力已经降低，暴露在外的分蘖节就会很容易地受到冻害。为了防止或减轻这种冻害，在播种之前应开排水沟，特别是在低洼地、地下水位浅或者冬季降水多的地区排水沟应开得深些，这样可减少耕作层过多的水分，缩小土壤冻结时的拉力，减轻土壤的松动。其次，在冬初开始上冻时，对麦苗复盖适当厚度的一层厩肥或草炭以减少土壤冻结的深度，使之解冻快，根系活动开始早。但要注意，不能盖得过早过厚，否则，会减弱麦苗的抗寒能力。
    整地不好，例如土块大、地不平整、播种深度太浅或不均一，都是容易使分蘖节暴露地表，或者距地表最低温度处太近，因而容易遭受冻害。冬春镇压是压实表土，消灭裂缝，不使分蘖节外露，对防冻能起到良好的作用。在冬初地表将要结冻以前进行灌冻水，能延缓表层地温降低，并使地温平稳下降，从而延长冬小麦冬前有效分蘖期限，并增强其抗寒能力，一般灌了冻水的麦地，春天解冻比较迟（比不灌水的迟一个星期左右），因此，最好在春初（华北地区宜在雨水到春分节期间）日平均气温大致稳定在1—6°时灌一次返青水，使土壤下层提早解冻，上层地温稳定升高，对防止冻害也能起到一定的作用。此外，在冬前对麦苗施以磷钾肥料也可以增强麦苗抗寒和抵御晚霜冻的能力。
    今年冬小麦生育的农业气象条件
    今年我国麦地一般深耕一尺以上，施底肥在三万斤以上，播种量每亩达三十斤。由于各地气象部门作了冬小麦适宜播种期的预报，大多数麦地作到了适时播种。有少部分麦地，因为今秋劳力紧张，耕作质量要求的高，播种稍迟。10与11两月中旬我国主要冬小麦地区——黄淮流域普遍降了两次透雨。这些为冬前麦苗生育良好打下了基础。深翻地和多施底肥能提高地温2°左右，有促进麦苗生育的作用，可以弥补一些麦地播种稍迟的缺点。
    从今年下半年开始我国各地气温一般都较常年为低，冬季也来临较早。从11月下旬起北方大部地区气温开始转变较常年为高。目前（12月上旬）黄淮流域天气比较温暖，日照充足，大风日数少，一般土壤水分适中，有利冬小麦分蘖和越冬前的抗寒锻炼。
    从现有的材料看来，北方地区除河南西部与河北等省部分地区麦苗尚在三叶期外，其余都已开始分蘖，麦苗一般生长良好。估计这些地区麦苗在停止生长以前能普遍达到分蘖在一至二个以上。
    长江流域以南不少地区播种较迟，多数尚在出苗阶段。南岭以南和广西东部以东地区两个多月以来未下透雨，影响播种。目前这些地区气温仍较常年为低，但由于这些地区冬季气温甚高，麦苗一般都不停止生长，故一般冬前生长不如北方的重要。
    今年冬季虽然来得早，冬前比较冷，从目前的趋势看来，今年我国大部地区冬季不致于比常年冷多少，明年春季可能较常年来临得早。这样的天气条件是有利于冬小麦安全过冬的。
