Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 2nd. A Middle East News Agency reporter reported from Khartoum that Wahab, a member of the Supreme Council of the Sudanese Armed Forces and Minister of Interior, said on the 1st that if the Sudanese government believes that U.S. "aid" will harm Sudan's independence and sovereignty, it will unswervingly abolish the U.S. "aid" agreement.

Wahab said that the Sudanese government itself will supervise the implementation of the agreement and will not allow anyone to interfere in the country's internal affairs. He finally emphasized: "We have the right to abolish the agreement after giving one month's notice in advance."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 1st. According to a report from Khartoum published in today's "Al-Ahram," Sudanese Minister of Information and Sudanese government spokesman Farid said, "We are determined to liberate our culture and language from the influence of British imperialism."

Farid pointed out that during the British colonial rule of Sudan, the British "stamped our culture with a hateful British mark, with the result that our youth speak English instead of Arabic, and it is much easier for them to express their opinions in English."

He also said, "As for the British officials employed by Sudan, we regard them as the same as any other foreign employees, but if they go beyond the scope of their responsibilities and work, then we will immediately order them to leave the country."

Earlier news from Khartoum said that the Sudanese government has decided to remove the statues of two British colonialists, Gordon and Kitchener, together with their pedestals, from Khartoum Square. It is expected that the two statues will be preserved in the Khartoum Museum.

    苏丹内政部长瓦哈卜表示
    美“援”如损害苏丹独立  苏丹将废除美“援”协定
    新华社开罗2日电  据中东通讯社记者自喀土穆报道，苏丹武装部队最高委员会委员、内政部长瓦哈卜在1日说，如果苏丹政府认为美“援”会损害苏丹的独立和主权时，它将毫不动摇地废除美“援”协定。
    瓦哈卜说，苏丹政府本身将监督协定的实现，不允许任何人干涉国家内政。他最后强调说：“我们有权在事前一个月提出照会以后废除协定”。
    新华社开罗1日电  据“金字塔报”今天刊载来自喀土穆的消息说，苏丹宣传部长和苏丹政府发言人法里德说，“我们决心要把我们的文化和语言从英帝国主义的影响下解放出来。”
    法里德指出，在英国对苏丹实行殖民统治期间，英国“在我们的文化上盖上了英国的可憎的印记，结果我们的青年说英语而不说阿拉伯语，他们用英语来发表意见要容易得多。”
    他又说，“至于被苏丹雇用的英国官员，我们把他们看成同其他任何外国雇员一样，但是，如果他们越出了他们的责任和工作的范围，那么我们将立即命令他们离开这个国家。”
    早些时候来自喀土穆的消息说，苏丹政府已经决定把在喀土穆广场上的两名英国殖民主义者戈登和基切讷的雕像连像座一起拆除。预计，这两个雕像将保存在喀土穆博物馆内。
