After reading the twelve children's poems selected above, I couldn't help but feel a surge of joy. Our children, with their pure emotions, sang praises to the heroic people, the heroic era, the happy life of the communes, and the joy of harvest. These poems are simple, beautiful, lively, and vibrant, just like the beautiful flowers and fruits of the Guolin Commune, as sweet as the grapes of the Guolin Commune.

Like these little poets from the Guolin Commune, they exist in every city and every commune throughout the country. Under the care of the Party, the assistance of society, and the support of teachers, they are growing up healthily. The younger generation is promising, and they will surpass our generation of poets. I wonder what Guo Lao and other poets think?

    后生可爱
    读了上面选辑的这十二首孩子的诗，止不住一阵阵高兴。我们的孩子们以他们的纯洁的感情，歌颂了英雄的人民，英雄的时代，歌颂了公社的幸福生活和丰收的喜悦。这些诗歌，朴实优美，生动活泼。真像果林公社的花果一样美，像果林公社的葡萄一样甜。
    像果林公社的这些小诗人，全国每个城市，每个公社都有。他们在党的关怀、社会的帮助和老师们的扶持下，健壮地成长起来。后生可爱，他们是会超过我们这一代的诗人的。不知郭老和其他的诗人们以为如何？
