Heroic Artillery Platoon Leader

Four days before the battle, Zhang Zuowu, the second artillery platoon leader and Communist Youth League member of a certain coastal artillery company, fell ill, suffering from diarrhea more than ten times a day. In order to make all battle preparations, he gritted his teeth and still worked with his comrades to dig soil, carry stones, and inspect cannons… The leadership and military doctor noticed his poor complexion and knew at a glance that this young man was hiding his illness and working again, and repeatedly advised him to rest. But Zhang Zuowu thought: Rest? What time is this! If we are going to punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops, can I rest? He requested to the military doctor: "This is my first time participating in combat!" Under his firm request, the military doctor had no choice but to let him join the battle while ill.

One evening, the battle began, and Zhang Zuowu calmly directed the cannons to engage in the punitive battle against the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen. Smoke and dust filled the sky over Kinmen Island, and several Chiang ships in the Liaoluo Bay desperately scurried out to sea. At this time, a Chiang Kai-shek "Zhong" class warship was hit by our artillery fire, so the Chiang Kai-shek troops concentrated the firepower of six or seven artillery companies and fired wildly at us. Shells exploded around the gun emplacement, and shells whizzed overhead. Zhang Zuowu shouted: Fire! Comrades, fire hard! Suddenly, two shells landed next to the gun emplacement, and more than a dozen pieces of shrapnel hit Zhang Zuowu. He only felt a shock in his body and then fainted. When he woke up, he found that the aiming gunner, Li Jinshan, was seriously injured and still sitting on the gun emplacement amidst the smoke and fire. Zhang Zuowu rushed into the thick smoke and flames at the risk of his life and rescued Li Jinshan from the fire. At this time, Zhang Zuowu was already scorched, but he endured the pain and persevered, thinking: My comrades are fighting intensely, I should persevere as long as I have a breath left! So he crawled to the dugout to bandage his wounds, and the pain caused him to faint again. When he woke up in the hospital, he still asked the leadership to let him return to the front lines.

    英勇的炮长
    在战斗前四天，岸炮某连二炮长、共青团员张作武就害病了，每天要腹泻十多次。为了作好一切战斗准备，他咬紧牙关仍和同志们一道挖土、抬石头、检查大炮……。领导上和军医发现他脸色不好，一眼就知道这个小伙子又瞒着病干活了，多次劝他去休息。可是张作武想：休息？这是什么时候！要惩罚蒋军，能休息吗？他向军医要求说：“我这是第一次参加战斗啊！”在他坚决的要求下，军医只好让他带病投入了战斗。
    一天傍晚，战斗开始了，张作武沉着地指挥大炮投入对金门蒋军的惩罚性战斗。金门岛上烟尘满天，料罗湾内几艘蒋舰没命地窜向外海。这时蒋军的“中字号”军舰被我炮火击中了，于是蒋军集中了六、七个炮连的火力向我方乱打。炮弹落在炮位周围爆炸，炮弹在头上呼啸。张作武高呼着；打呀！同志们，狠狠地打呀！突然两发炮弹落在炮位旁边，十多块弹片打在张作武身上，他只觉得身体一震，就昏过去了。等他醒来，发现瞄准手李金山身负重伤还坐在一片烟火的炮位上。张作武不顾生命危险冲进浓烟烈火，把李金山从火海中救了出来。这时，张作武已被烧得皮焦肉绽，但是他忍着痛苦坚持着，他想：同志们正在紧张地战斗，自己有一口气就应该坚持下去呀！于是他爬到避弹室去包扎伤口，伤口痛得他又昏过去了。当他在医院中醒来时，他还要求领导上让他重返前线。
