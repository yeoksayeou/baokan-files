The First Hairdressing Textbook

People have never seen a hairdressing textbook anywhere, but now Shanghai has one. This textbook was written by three students from the Education Department of East China Normal University to meet the needs of a workers' family amateur school.

When the three young people were writing, they had no reference materials at hand and no teachers to consult. After discussing it for a while, the three decided to leave the school and go into practice to complete this creation. They found a barber who had been rated as an advanced worker in a barbershop near the school, recorded his dictation as a draft. At the same time, they put forward a student as a customer, and the other two students depicted all the actions during the haircutting process, such as blocking the scissors, crimping the hair, and blowing the hair, so this textbook was written with both pictures and texts, and it was easy to understand. However, after the compilation was completed, no one reviewed the manuscript, so they went to the barbershop again to ask the barber to help complete the finalization work.

After the first draft of this textbook was written, it was welcomed by vocational middle schools with hairdressing classes. The Shanghai Municipal Education Department has now printed this textbook.

    第一本理发教科书
    人们从来没有见过哪里有理发教科书，现在上海却有了一本。这本教科书是华东师范大学教育系的三个学生，为满足工人家属的一所业余学校的需要而编写的。
    三个青年编写时，手头没有一点资料可以参考，没有一位教师可以请教。三人商量了一会，决定走出学校到实际中去完成这部创作。他们在学校附近的一家理发店找到一位曾被评为先进工作者的理发师，记录他的口述，作为底稿。同时推出一个学生当顾客，由另外两个学生描绘理发过程中的挡剪子、轧发、吹风等全部动作，因此这本教科书编写得图文并茂，通俗易懂。可是，编完了没有人审稿，又到理发店请理发师帮助完成了定稿工作。
    这本教科书初稿写出来后，受到设有理发班的职业中学的欢迎。上海市教育部门现在已把这本教材印制出来了。
