    Great Gains from Labor Training
    Du Junlin, First Secretary of the CCP Henan Xuchang County Committee
    The 171 cadres from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government who were sent to our county are about to embark on new work posts in order to adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward. As soon as this news spread, it immediately caused a sensation among the people of the county. The people were reluctant to let the transferred cadres leave, but for the needs of the Party, they could not be retained. It was truly difficult to part with them. The masses' deep revolutionary friendship with the transferred cadres, built on ideology, labor, work, and life, is completely understandable.
    The Party's policy of sending cadres to lower levels is extremely wise. This measure not only cultivated and trained cadres, strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, but also educated the masses and powerfully promoted the Great Leap Forward in rural production. The transfer of cadres from the Ministry of Agriculture to our county was a great encouragement to the cadres and masses of our county. The masses saw the transfer of cadres as the Party and Chairman Mao's concern for them, so their enthusiasm for production was even greater. Some young intellectuals who were previously uneasy about working in rural areas also settled down under the influence of the transferred cadres. After arriving in the countryside, the transferred cadres immediately plunged into the high tide of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and they and the people of the county carried out a series of intense battles together. In addition to actively engaging in labor, the transferred cadres also did many beneficial social activities. According to statistics, while working, they also assisted the masses in establishing 21 spare-time middle schools, 10 people's schools, 11 Red and Expert schools, 91 literacy classes, 6 various universities, 1 drama academy, and 130 various short-term training classes, and assisted the township Party committees in opening 3 Party schools. In addition, they specifically helped the communes establish 2 pesticide plants, 1 winery, 1 weather station, and 15 bacterial fertilizer plants. Thanks to their active efforts, the county solved the difficulty of insufficient timely topdressing of wheat fields in less than half a month, and opened up a broad source of fertilizer for striving for a greater agricultural harvest in our county. In order to create miracles of high yield, each transferred cadre personally cultivated experimental fields. The 171 of them cultivated more than 193 mu in total, creating many high-yield miracles.
    In labor training, the transferred cadres truly learned to care about the lives of the masses. According to the needs of the masses, they consciously helped establish 8 nurseries, 14 kindergartens, 17 public canteens, and 8 health stations. Most of these welfare organizations are run very well and have become models for the local area, which plays a huge role in promoting welfare work throughout the county.
    The transferred cadres cultivated a communist labor attitude in labor training. Their soaring drive is admirable. As soon as they arrived in the countryside, everyone demanded to do heavy work. In labor, they first overcame the "five barriers": the blister barrier, the leg pain barrier, the back pain barrier, the eye strain barrier, and the life barrier (eating, lodging, drinking water, etc.). Now, they have come to see labor as a very pleasant thing. They eat, live, and work with the masses, and in addition to carrying out field labor, they also help the masses with household chores. The comrades have done everything the masses need to do. Because the comrades actively worked, loved the socialist cause, and cared about the lives of the masses, they were respected and loved by the broad masses. Many people were selected as county-level socialist construction activists, township-level models, and deputy directors, deputy captains, and other positions. Six comrades were also honorably admitted to the Communist Party.
    Of course, it is still a new task for cadres to go to the countryside and mountains for training. Therefore, not every comrade can quickly recognize its benefits. At the beginning, some transferred cadres also had one-sided understandings, such as some people worried that training in the countryside would affect scientific research, affect learning, and so on. Facts have refuted these arguments. After nine months of labor training and a series of social struggles, the transferred cadres not only learned many production knowledge, scientific knowledge, and methods of leading grassroots work in practice, but also became more firm in their ideological viewpoints and positions, and achieved great harvests in political ideology, physical labor, and production technology, all of which undeniably prove once again that the Party's cadre line and the policy of labor training are completely correct.

    劳动锻炼收获大
    中共河南许昌县委第一书记  杜俊林
    中央农业部下放到我县的一百七十一名干部，适应大跃进形势的需要，将奔赴新的工作岗位。这消息一传出，立即轰动了全县人民，人们不愿意让下放干部走，可是为了党的需要，又不能挽留。真是难舍难分。群众对下放干部这种依依惜别的感情是完全可以理解的。因为下放干部和群众从思想上、劳动上、工作和生活上已经建立起了亲如一家的深厚的革命友谊。
    党的干部下放的政策，是十分英明的。这个措施，不仅培养和锻炼了干部，加强了干部和群众的关系，而且也教育了群众，有力地推动了农村的生产大跃进。中央农业部干部下放到我县这件事对我县干部和群众都有很大鼓舞。群众把干部下放看成是党和毛主席对他们的关心，因此生产劲头更大。一些青年知识分子过去不安心在农村工作，在下放干部的影响下也安心了。农业部的下放干部到农村以后，立即投入了全面大跃进的高潮，他们和全县人民一起进行了一系列的紧张的战斗。下放干部除了积极劳动，还做了许多有益的社会活动。据统计，他们在劳动的同时，还协助群众兴办了业余中学二十一处、民校十处、红专学校十一处、扫盲班九十一处、各种大学六处、戏剧学院一处、各种短期训练班一百三十次、协助乡党委开办党校三处。此外，具体帮助公社建立起农药场二个、酿酒厂一个、气象台一个、细菌肥料厂十五个。在他们的积极努力下，全县不到半个月的时间，就解决了麦田适时追肥不足的困难，而且为争取我县农业更大的丰收开辟了广阔肥料来源。为了创造丰产奇迹，每个下放干部都亲手培育了试验田。他们一百七十一人共培育了一百九十三亩多，创造出了许多高额丰产奇迹。
    下放干部在劳动锻炼中真正地学会了关心群众生活。他们根据群众的需要，自觉地帮助建立起托儿所八个、幼儿园十四个、公共食堂十七个、保健站八个。这些福利组织，大部分都办的很好，成为当地的典范，这对全县的福利工作，起着巨大的推动作用。
    下放干部在劳动锻炼中培养了共产主义的劳动态度。他们的冲天干劲是令人钦佩的。一到农村大家都要求干重活。在劳动中他们首先是过好了“五关”：磨泡关、腿痛关、腰痛关、熬眼关和生活关（吃、住、喝水等）。现在，他们已经把劳动看作是十分愉快的事情。他们和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，除了进行田间劳动，还帮助群众做家务活，群众需要做的活，同志们都做到了。由于同志们积极劳动，热爱社会主义事业，关心群众生活，受到了广大群众的尊敬和爱戴。许多人被选为县的社会主义建设积极分子，乡的模范和副主任、副队长等职务。六个同志还光荣地被吸收为共产党员。
    当然，干部下乡上山锻炼，毕竟还是一项新的工作。因此，不是每个同志都能很快地认识到它的好处。开始，在一部分下放干部中也存在着片面的认识，如有的人担心下乡锻炼会影响科学研究、会影响学习，等等。事实已经驳倒了这些论调。经过九个月的劳动锻炼和一系列的社会斗争，下放干部在实践中不仅学会了许许多多的生产知识、科学知识和领导基层工作的方法，而且在思想观点和立场上也更加坚定了，取得了政治思想、体力劳动和生产技术各方面的大丰收，这些都无可置辩地再一次证明了党的干部路线和劳动锻炼的方针是完全正确的。
