Heroic Sons and Daughters
Jun Qing Yu Tian
    We had the opportunity to visit the front lines of coastal defense in Fujian, in Chenggong Township, Nan'an County, the hometown of Zheng Chenggong, a national hero of the late Ming Dynasty, and met many people on the front lines. Chenggong Township is named after Zheng Chenggong. Two hundred years ago, Zheng Chenggong trained his navy in this area and defeated the Dutch colonialists in one fell swoop, liberating the motherland's territory of Taiwan. Even now, his great achievements are still praised by the villagers, and many of his relics are treasured by the people. Today, the people on the coastal defense front are experiencing a struggle that is greater and more arduous than in the past. They are not only undertaking the struggle to liberate Taiwan, but also building a beautiful and happy socialist homeland. During our visit, we saw many fields destroyed by enemy shells, but unprecedented harvests were obtained in these fields; many beautiful houses were destroyed by the enemy, but countless "underground palaces" were built next to the piles of rubble, and socialist collective undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly were established. Today, on the coastal defense front and in the "heroic" hometown, the number of heroes is too numerous to count, whether in the struggle against the enemy or in socialist construction. We will now select two or three examples to tell our readers.

	Construction is possible even on the front lines
    "Persisting in the struggle against the enemy while also persisting in production" is not an exaggeration when applied to the militia of the Wujiang Village area of Chenggong Township.
    More than a thousand houses originally located on the coast in Wujiang Village have all been reduced to rubble under the frenzied fire of the enemy. There are countless shell craters around the village's fields and coastal salt pans, and seven hundred acres of land have not been leveled and are no longer cultivable. At first glance, it seems that there is only the struggle against the enemy here, and there is no talk of construction at all. But we have enough evidence to convince people that the enemy's artillery fire cannot destroy the will of the people of Wujiang Village, and their struggle against the enemy and production are becoming more and more outstanding. Sweet potatoes are the main agricultural product here, and this year's total sweet potato production exceeded last year's. In salt production, the yield per unit area can also be increased by about 50%. Although the original homes were destroyed, with the assistance of the troops, more than 500 new houses were rebuilt at a new site, and most of the people have moved into new homes.
    How did they get their harvest? A few examples here can explain it clearly. According to Li Jiangjin, the Party branch secretary, they planted one mu of late sweet potato experimental field this year. Because of the enemy's artillery harassment, it took seven plantings to get it right. Some wheat was damaged by shells, so the land was leveled again and planted again, some continuously for three times. On August 29, the enemy frantically bombarded the village, and six breaches, totaling one hundred and twenty feet long, were opened in the salt pan embankment. At that time, night had already fallen, and the tide was about to rise. If repairs were not made quickly, the entire embankment would be washed away by the tide, and one thousand eight hundred acres of salt pans would be completely destroyed. More than one hundred militiamen in the village immediately mobilized and went down to the salt pans to repair the embankment. Enemy shells exploded on the beach from time to time, but none of the militiamen retreated. By the time the tide rose, the destroyed embankment had been completely repaired.
    The enemy's frenzied shelling aroused the infinite hatred of our militiamen, and they were determined to practice their skills and punish the enemy with their own hands. On September 21, with the consent of the artillery unit, they sent a group of militiamen to the position to practice artillery firing. After half a day of practice, they learned all the artillery firing techniques except for operating the aiming device. That very afternoon, they personally fired a batch of shells at the Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops' positions. This militia team also practiced martial arts regularly. At the end of the recent winter training, they conducted a shooting test, and 98% of them reached good and excellent standards, becoming the excellent militia team in the whole township.

	Like Legendary Heroines
    There is a female militia team in Xiawu Village, Chenggong Township, which was named the "Hua Mulan Assault Team" by the front-line troops. This female militia team actively completes various support tasks in the artillery fire, and their heroic deeds, like legendary heroines, are circulated among the soldiers and civilians on the front lines.
      The "Hua Mulan Assault Team" has a total of thirty-six members, the youngest, Peng Tiaohua, is only fifteen years old, and the average age is only seventeen or eighteen years old. Under the leadership of Captain Zhuo Wufu, they work with the village's youth production team to assist the troops in transporting materials and repairing roads and bridges. Once, the leaders of the troops asked the village to send a group of strong laborers to help build a road more than two li long. Wang Bangwan, the director of the first cooperative in the village's outpost, decided to send the "Hua Mulan Assault Team" to take on this task. When the leaders of the troops saw that they were women, they were afraid that they would not be able to complete the task, but they still let them try it for a day. The members of the "Hua Mulan Assault Team" knew that if this road was not built quickly, our artillery would not be able to enter the position, so everyone was as energetic as dragons and tigers. As soon as they entered the construction site, they immediately started working, digging and carrying. They didn't care that the rain soaked their clothes or that their hands blistered and bled. When the soldiers saw this situation, they were afraid that they would be exhausted, so they mobilized them to rest for a while before continuing. But they didn't rest and continued to work non-stop. The road was originally scheduled to be completed in five days, but it was all completed in three days and one night. The soldiers all praised them, saying, "Don't underestimate them, this female militia is stronger than the men."
    One day, the artillery battle was very intense. The members suddenly saw that a certain artillery position was on fire. They all rushed out of the air-raid shelter, carrying fire extinguishers and buckets, braving the artillery fire, and ran quickly to carry water to the position bucket by bucket, putting out the fire and preventing the troops from suffering losses.
    During the days of battle, the members of the "Hua Mulan Assault Team" saw that the troops were tense and working hard, and they had to sew and wash their own clothes, so they discussed taking on this task to give the soldiers more time to rest and have plenty of energy to fight the enemy. When members Wu Kelun and Wu Xuhui saw that the soldiers' clothes were torn and they couldn't find cloth of similar colors to mend them, they took apart their own good clothes to mend them. The members sewed the quilts washed during the day overnight and sent them to the position.

			A "Small Fleet"
    The sea surface from Chenggong Township to a certain island on the front line has become an unbroken sea route. On this route, there is often a transport fleet traveling between the enemy's heart in Jinmen, delivering materials day and night to the People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed on a certain island on the front line. The enemy in Jinmen simply hates them to the bone. Whenever they set sail, the enemy always pours batches of shells into the sea, trying to destroy them, but the enemy is always disappointed, and this fleet continues to sail unhindered. The People's Liberation Army soldiers on the island gave this fleet a glorious title, calling it the "Maritime Small Fleet."
    Speaking of the "Maritime Small Fleet," everyone on the front line knows about it. They are composed of thirty-eight militiamen from Chenggong Township. Some of these thirty-eight militiamen have been fighting the enemy on this route for several years, and they have figured out all the enemy's tricks. In July of this year, the working group announced a new support task to them—to open up a sea route between the enemy's heart and continuously deliver military supplies to the People's Liberation Army on a certain island on the front line. Before the working group could finish the last sentence, all thirty-eight people had already signed up. That night, everyone started working, repairing tools and studying ways to deal with the enemy. The cooperative also sent committee member Hong Jiude to lead the fleet. From then on, they took on this arduous task, fighting the wind, waves, and shells in the ocean day and night.
    On September 10, the night was pitch black, and the stars flickered faintly in the sky. Jinmen, a few miles away, lay horizontally on the sea like a dead sea turtle. The "Small Fleet" sailed towards a certain island at high speed, cutting through the rolling waves. The vigilant crew members had made all preparations. The mast ropes were pulled taut, creaking, and everyone's eyes were fixed on this "dead sea turtle." One blockade line after another was crossed. Just as the crew members breathed a sigh of relief, suddenly two fireballs rose from the enemy island and descended directly onto the sea. Hong Jiude immediately shouted, "Flares, scatter!" Before he could finish speaking, there were countless loud noises. Shell fragments and waves flew directly onto the boat, and columns of water more than a zhang high blocked the way. The smoke was so choking that people couldn't even open their eyes. In this situation, the crew bravely steered the boat through the hail of shrapnel. The "Golden Victory" boat, loaded with supplies, was damaged in two places, the mast rope was also cut off by shrapnel, and the boat body was shaken around by the shells and waves. Seawater was pouring into the boat. Crew member Hong Shuican glanced at the piled-up supplies, suddenly crawled out from the bottom of the boat, and pulled the mast rope hard, tying it together piece by piece. Veteran helmsman Hong Shuiwang found the hatch cover in the emergency and blocked the leak. They finally broke through the artillery fire and met the People's Liberation Army soldiers on the island victoriously. (Attached photo)
    The militiamen of Chenggong Township are conducting military training. They are determined to raise their military skills to the level of the regular army in a short period of time.

    英雄儿女
    俊卿雨田
    我们获得了一次机会，到福建海防前哨之一、明末民族英雄郑成功的家乡——南安县成功乡进行访问，并在前沿阵地上会见了许多群众。成功乡是以郑成功的名字命名的。二百年前，郑成功曾在这一带操练海军，一举打败了荷兰殖民主义者，解放了祖国领土台湾。直至现在，他的伟绩还为乡人所赞颂，他的许多遗迹、遗物还为人们珍贵地保存着。今天，海防前线人民正在经历着比过去更伟大更艰巨的斗争，他们不仅担负起解放台湾的斗争，同时正在建设美丽幸福的社会主义家园。在我们这次访问中，看到许多田园被敌人的炮弹毁坏了，但是就在这些田园里获得了空前的丰收；许多美丽的屋舍被敌人破坏了，但在堆堆瓦砾的旁边却建起了无数的“地下宫殿”，办起了社会主义的集体事业——食堂、托儿所、敬老院。今天的海防前线、“英雄”的家乡，不论是在对敌斗争中或者在社会主义建设中，英雄之多难以数计。我们现在选其二三例告诉给读者。
     在前线也能建设
    “既坚持了对敌斗争，又坚持了生产”这对成功乡浯江村一带的民兵来说，并不是夸张的用词。
    浯江村原有一千多座位于海滨的房子，在敌人疯狂的炮火摧残下，全部化为瓦砾了，村子周围的田地和海滨的盐坑里，有数不尽的弹坑，七百亩土地没有重新平整，已经无法耕种。乍看起来，好像这里只有对敌斗争，根本谈不上建设。但是我们却有足够的证据使人相信，敌人的炮火摧不毁浯江村人民的斗志，他们的对敌斗争和生产越干越出色。甘薯是这里的主要农产品，今年甘薯的总产量超过去年，盐业生产，单位面积产量也可增产50％左右，原来的家园虽然被破坏了，但在部队的协助下，另择新址重建了五百多间新的房屋，大部分群众已经迁入新居。
    他们的丰收是怎样得来的呢？这里有几个例子就可以交代清楚。据党支部书记李江进说：今年他们种了一亩晚甘薯试验田，因敌人的炮击骚扰，种了七次才种好，有些麦子被炮弹打坏了，就重新平整土地种上，有的连续种了三次。8月29日，敌人疯狂地轰击这个村子，盐坑围堤被打开六个缺口，共有一百二十尺长，当时夜幕已经降临，海潮快要上涨，如不赶快抢修，全部围堤就会被潮水冲垮，一千八百公亩盐坑就会全部毁掉。村里的一百多个民兵，立即动员起来，下盐坑抢修，敌人的炮弹不时在海滩爆炸，民兵们没有一个退缩，到涨潮时被毁的围堤已经全部修好了。
    敌人的疯狂炮击，激起了我民兵们的无比愤恨，他们决心练好本领，亲手惩罚敌人。9月21日，他们得到炮兵部队的同意，派了一批民兵到阵地练习打炮，经过半天的练习，除了操纵瞄准器以外全部学会了开炮的技术。就在当天下午，他们就亲手把一批炮弹轰向金门蒋军阵地。这支民兵队还经常练武，在最近冬训结束时进行射击测试，有98％达到了良好和优秀标准，成为全乡的优秀民兵队。
    像传奇中的女英雄一样
    成功乡下浯村有一支女民兵队，被前线部队命名为“花木兰突击队”。这支女民兵队在炮火中积极完成各项支前工作，她们的英雄事迹像传奇中的巾帼英雄一样，在前线军民中流传着。
      “花木兰突击队”共有三十六个队员，最小的彭挑花只有十五岁，平均年龄也不过十七、八岁。她们在队长卓乌富领导下和村里的青年生产队一起，协助部队搬运物资，抢修公路桥梁。有一次，部队首长要求村里派出一批劳力强的民工，帮助开一条两里多长的公路，该村前哨一社社长王邦万决定派“花木兰突击队”去担任这一工作，部队首长一看是女的，怕她们完不成，但还是让她们试一天看看。“花木兰突击队”的队员们知道，这条公路不赶快修好，我们的大炮就不能进入阵地，所以个个生龙活虎似的，一进入工地就立即动起手来，挖的挖、挑的挑。大雨把衣服淋湿，手起泡出了血也不当一回事。战士们看到这种情况，生怕她们累坏了，就动员她们休息一会再干。但她们不休息，仍然不停地干。这条公路原来预定五天完成，可是三天一夜就全部修好了。战士们都称赞说：“小瞧不得，这支女民兵比男的还强呢。”
    有一天，炮战进行得很剧烈，队员们突然看见某炮兵阵地起火了，她们都冲出防炮洞，提着灭火器和水桶，冒着炮火，飞跑地把水一桶桶提到阵地，把火扑灭，使部队没有受到损失。
    在战斗的日子里，“花木兰突击队”的队员们看到部队又紧张又辛苦，衣服还得自己缝补浆洗，她们就商量好把这份任务担当起来，让战士有更多的时间休息，有充沛的精力来打击敌人。队员吴蚵论、吴秀惠看到战士的衣服破了，又找不到近似颜色的布来补，就把自己好的衣服拆下来补。队员们白天洗好的被子就连夜缝好，送到阵地上去。
            一支“小舰队”
    成功乡到前线某岛的海面上，已经成为一条打不断的海上航线。在这条航线上，经常有一支运输船队往来于金门敌人心腹之间，夜以继日地把物资运送到坚守前线某岛的解放军手里。金门的敌人简直恨透了他们，每当他们扬帆出海，敌人总是把成批炮弹倾泻在海里，企图消灭他们，但是敌人每次都失望了，这支船队照常畅行无阻。岛上的解放军战士，给这支船队送一个光荣的称号，叫作“海上小舰队”。
    说起“海上小舰队”来，前线人人都知道。他们是由成功乡三十八个民兵组成的。这三十八个民兵，有的和敌人在这条航线上已经斗争了几年，敌人的一套鬼把戏，他们已经摸透了。今年7月间，工作组向他们宣布了一项新的支前任务——要在敌人心脏之间打通一条海上航线，把军用物资源源不绝地送到前线某岛解放军手里。不等工作组讲完最后一句话，三十八个人已经全部报名了。当天晚上，大家就动起手来，一面修整工具，一面研究对付敌人的办法。社里也派了社委洪九得来领导这个船队。从此，他们就担起这个艰巨的任务，日日夜夜在海洋里和风浪、炮弹搏斗。
    9月10日，夜色漆黑，星星闪着微光在空中抖擞，几里外的金门像死去的一只大海龟一样横躺在海上。“小舰队”划破滚滚巨浪用高速向某岛开航了。警惕着的船员们已经作好了一切准备，桅绳被拉得吱吱直响，每个人的眼光都紧紧盯住这个“死海龟”不放，一道一道封锁线穿过去了。正当船员们松了一口气的时候，忽然间从敌岛上升起了两团火球，直向海面降来。洪九得马上喊了一声：“照明弹，散开！”，话还没有落音，紧接着是无数声巨响，炮弹片和浪花直向船上飞来，一丈多高的水柱挡住了去路，硝烟呛得连眼睛也睁不开。就在这种情况下，船员们勇敢地把船从弹片纷飞中钻过去了。满载物资的“金胜利”号船盆面被炸伤两处，桅绳也被弹片割断了，船身被炮弹、浪花震得团团转，海水也往船中直冒。船员洪水灿瞧了瞧堆着的物资，猛然从船底钻出来，使劲拉住了桅绳，一处一处结起来。老舵手洪水汪在万急中找到舱盖，堵住了漏洞。他们终于冲出了炮弹重围，和岛上的解放军战士胜利地会见了。（附图片）
    成功乡民兵正在进行军事训练。他们决心在短期内把军事技术提高到正规军的水平。
