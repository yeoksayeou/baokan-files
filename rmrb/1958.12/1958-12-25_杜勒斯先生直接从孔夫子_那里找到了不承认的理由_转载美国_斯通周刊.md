Editor's Note: The American "Stone Weekly" published an article on the 15th entitled "Mr. Dulles Directly Found Reasons for Non-Recognition from Confucius." This is a very interesting article that expresses the views of general enlightened Americans on Secretary of State Dulles' recent outrageous slanders against the Chinese People's Commune movement. This article sarcastically satirizes Dulles' slander and stubbornness. Our newspaper published a summary of this article on the 21st, and now we are translating the full text as follows:

On the shocking decline of the
    trend of respecting ancestors in New China

Mr. Dulles, in his speech in San Francisco about "Why we should never - yes, never - recognize Communist China," reached a climax when he talked about the danger this posed to traditional Chinese culture. The Secretary of State said, with an almost Confucian-like tone of anger: "The sacred tombs of the ancestors are being desecrated everywhere." It is a pity that he did not continue along this line. In fact, it is more than just the trend of respecting ancestors that is declining. In China, brides and grooms are now getting married without consulting horoscopes, and houses are being built without considering feng shui. This disregard for the heavens is bound to bring down the regime sooner or later.

Mr. Dulles spoke of the terrible experiences the Chinese people are undergoing. Mr. Dulles said: "Individuality and personality are being brutally destroyed." In the "good old days," the poorest coolie or rickshaw puller in Shanghai could wander around the streets at will after a day's work (just like his counterparts still do in Cairo and Calcutta), and then decide which doorway or roadside to spend the night in. That's how personality was developed. Mr. Dulles went on to talk about the new commune system, saying: "Children are sent to large-scale nurseries so that women can also engage in some form of slave labor." In the "good old days," there were no "large-scale" nurseries, not even small-scale private nurseries. Children did not leave their mothers, and both mother and child had to work.

Where the "good old days" still exist

The "good old days" still exist in Hong Kong. Not many days after Mr. Dulles said these words, Peggy Dou Ding talked about the situation in that city in the December 7th issue of the "New York Times Magazine." Ms. Dou Ding was talking about the more fortunate people, saying: "In some families, the father has a fixed occupation, perhaps in a Chinese factory, working ten hours a day on piecework, seven days a week, while his wife does embroidery at home, taking care of three malnourished children at the same time."

Even in such a paradise, social reforms have been gradually implemented. Ms. Dou Ding mentioned the new regulations that limit the working hours of working women and children – but not men – to ten hours a day and six days a week. She quoted a warning from a major Hong Kong newspaper, the "South China Morning Post," that the city "must implement gradual rather than revolutionary progress in this social reform." After a few years of godless propaganda, male workers in Hong Kong will also demand rest on Sundays.

This change in the working hours of women and children is due to external influences. On November 5th, the "Washington Post" published a report from Hong Kong by John Norris, stating that the regulation prohibiting women and children from working more than six days a week and ten hours a day was promulgated by the British colonial authorities because the British government complained about the competition from cheap textiles. (From this we can see how the proletariat benefits from colonialism.) According to Mr. Norris, the blow suffered by Hong Kong capitalists was lessened because the new regulations "did not contain a guarantee that the total wages would not be reduced." Thus, the pious factory owners are still able to maintain their ancestral graves in their customary manner.

Troubles that noble people don't talk about

Ms. Dou Ding wrote: "Few Hong Kong residents face the unpleasant possibility: that tens of thousands of people are suppressing their resentment as they see others living in abundance every day while they themselves are deprived of basic work rights. This resentment may one day tragically erupt into violent action." When this happens, we can expect Mr. Dulles to attribute this riot to indirect aggression, subversive propaganda, and a lack of sound religious training. Ms. Dou Ding wrote that among the people in Hong Kong who live better lives, talking about the surrounding hardships "is simply inappropriate." This also reminds people of the "good old days" all over Asia.

Of course, there are many refugees in Hong Kong who have fled from the Communist mainland, and their escape, like the escape of other people across the Soviet border, proves that the new regime has many flaws. (Editor's note: The People's Republic of China, like all other socialist countries, does indeed "have many flaws" in the eyes of all kinds of reactionary forces, because our regime wants to destroy the political and economic status of these reactionary forces so that the people can obtain the political and economic status they deserve.) But we better not be too complacent. The hardships in mainland China are the hardships experienced by a nation that is working hard with its bare hands and making great strides to get rid of poverty. The hope it brings for the future cannot be found in the slums of Hong Kong, that is, in the "good old days." Our understanding of the great leap forward in New China has been obscured by hateful propaganda.

Steel production ranks third in the world

Let's talk about one of the many problems. On December 9th, the "Baltimore Sun" published a dispatch from its London office, which quoted a British trade publication, saying: "This year's Great Leap Forward" (as the Chinese Communists call it) may enable China to surpass Britain, West Germany, and France in 1959 to become the world's third-largest steel producer, second only to the United States and the Soviet Union. (Editor's note: In 1959, our steel production may not reach this step.) The British International Trade Promotion Committee said that this marked "a scale of growth that has never been seen in any country before," and that Beijing's planners repeatedly underestimated the amount of increase in steel production. A giant has awakened, and it is freeing itself from poverty. It is unwise for us to close our eyes to this progress. It is inappropriate for a wealthy and fortunate nation like ourselves to evaluate this situation with Mr. Dulles' self-righteous and distorted perspective. The day will come when the new China will also have ample strength to take care of its ancestors' graves.

    杜勒斯先生直接从孔夫子  那里找到了不承认的理由
    ——转载美国“斯通周刊”
    编者按：美国“斯通周刊”15日刊载了一篇文章，题目是“杜勒斯先生直接从孔夫子那里找到了不承认的理由”。这是一篇很有意思的文章，它表达了美国一般有识之士对美国国务卿杜勒斯最近一再放肆诽谤中国人民公社运动的看法。这篇文章辛辣地讽刺了杜勒斯的诬蔑和顽固不化。本报在21日曾发表了这篇文章的摘要，现在将该文全文译载如下：
  论新中国崇敬祖先
    的风气的惊人衰落
    杜勒斯先生在旧金山发表的关于“为什么我们决不——是的，决不——应该承认共产党中国”的演说快到高潮时，谈到了这样做对于中国传统文化的危险。这位国务卿用一种几乎是孔夫子式的愤怒口吻说：“祖先的神圣的坟墓正在到处受到亵渎。”遗憾的是，他没有顺着这种脉络继续谈下去。其实日益衰落的岂止崇敬祖先的风气而已。在中国，现在新郎和新娘不算八字就结婚，不看风水就修房屋，这种蔑视老天爷的作法，迟早一定要使这个政权垮台的。
    杜勒斯先生谈到了中国人正在经历着的恐怖遭遇。杜勒斯先生说：“个性和人格遭到了粗暴的摧残。”在“过去的好日子”里，上海最贫苦的苦力或黄包车夫在他劳动了一天以后，可以随意在街上到处游逛（就像他的同行现在在开罗和加尔各答仍然在做的那样），然后再决定他在哪一个门口或路边过夜。人格就是这样发展的。杜勒斯先生接着谈到新的公社制度说：“儿童被送进大规模托儿所，好让妇女们也能够从事一部分奴隶劳动。”在“过去的好日子”里，没有“大规模的”托儿所，连私人的小规模托儿所也没有，儿童们不离开他们的母亲，母子都得工作。
    “过去的好日子”仍然存在的地方
    “过去的好日子”在香港仍然存在。在杜勒斯先生说这些话以后不多天，佩吉·窦丁在12月7日的“纽约时报杂志”上谈到了那个城市的情况。窦丁女士所谈的是比较幸运的人们，她说：“在有些家庭里，父亲有一个固定的职业，也许是在一家中国工厂里，每天作十小时计件工作，每星期工作七天，他的妻子在家里作刺绣，同时照管三个营养不足的孩子。”
    即使在这样的天堂里，也一直逐渐在实行社会改革。窦丁女士谈到了把劳动妇女和儿童——但是不是男人——的工作时间限制为每天十小时和每周工作六天的新规章。她援引了一家重要香港报纸“南华日报”提出的警告说，这座城市“在这种社会改革中一定要实行逐步的而不是革命性的进展”。经过几年的不信神的宣传以后，香港的男工也将要求在星期天休息了。
    妇女和儿童工作时间的这种改变是由于外来影响造成的。11月5日“华盛顿邮报”刊载了约翰·诺里斯从香港发回的报道说，不许妇女和儿童每周工作超过六天，每天工作超过十小时的规定是英国殖民当局颁布的，因为英国本土政府抱怨廉价纺织品的竞争。（从这里我们可以看到无产阶级是怎样从殖民主义得到好处的。）据诺里斯先生说，由于新的规章中“不包含关于工资总额将不降低的保证”，香港资本家所遭到的打击减轻了。于是虔敬的厂主们仍然能够用他们习惯的方式保持他们的祖坟了。
  高尚的人们不谈的麻烦
    窦丁女士写道：“很少香港居民正视这种不愉快的可能性：成千成万的人们在天天看到别人丰衣足食而自己竟然被剥夺了基本的工作权利的情况下，正在抑制着自己的愤恨情绪，这种愤恨情绪可能有一天会可悲地爆发成为暴力行动。”当这种情况发生的时候我们可以预料，杜勒斯先生会把这种暴乱归因于间接侵略、颠复性宣传和缺乏健全的宗教训练。窦丁女士写道，在香港生活较好的人中间，谈到周围的困苦情况“简直是不合时宜的”。这也使人想起了亚洲各地的“过去的好日子”。
    当然香港有很多从共产党大陆逃来的难民，他们的逃亡就像越过苏联边境的其他人们的逃亡一样，证明新政权有很多毛病。（编者按：中华人民共和国的政权，同其他一切社会主义国家的政权一样，对于各色各样的反动势力说来的确“有很多毛病”，因为我们的政权要破坏这些反动势力的政治经济地位，以便使人民获得应有的政治经济地位。）但是我们最好不要太沾沾自喜。中国大陆的困苦是一个正在赤手空拳地努力奋斗、大步跃进争取摆脱贫困状态的民族所经历的困苦。它为未来带来的希望，是在香港贫民窟中，也就是说在“过去的好日子里”所找不到的。我们对于新中国巨大的跃进的了解，受到了仇恨宣传的蒙蔽。
    钢的生产占世界第三位
    我们谈一谈许多问题中的一个。12月9日“巴尔的摩太阳报”刊载了它的伦敦办事处的一篇电讯，电讯中援引了一家英国贸易刊物中的话，这篇电讯说：“今年的大跃进”（像中国共产党人所称呼的那样）可能使中国在1959年超过英国、西德和法国，成为仅次于美国和苏联的世界第三大钢铁生产国。（编者按：在1959年我国的钢铁产量可能还达不到这一步。）英国国际贸易促进委员会说，这标志着“一种以前在任何国家都不曾有过的增长的规模”，而且北京的计划人员一再低估了钢产量增加的数量。一个巨人觉醒了，它正在使自己从贫困中摆脱出来。我们闭着眼睛不看这种进展是不明智的。对像我们自己这样一个富裕的、幸运的民族来说，用杜勒斯先生的自以为是的歪曲眼光来估量这种情况是不相宜的。新中国也有充分的力量来照顾它的祖先的坟墓的日子就到要来了。
