Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 4th: More than a thousand women representatives from all circles in Hanoi gathered at the Labor Club on the evening of the 3rd to warmly welcome the Chinese women's delegation headed by Zhang Qian.

Accompanied by leaders of the Vietnam Women's Union, Le Thi Xuyen and Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong, Zhang Qian and others entered the venue. Amidst thunderous applause, young women from Hanoi presented flowers to the Chinese women representatives.

The wife of Yang An, head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China, who accompanied the delegation, was also invited to attend the meeting.

Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong, Chairman of the Hanoi Women's Federation, spoke on behalf of Hanoi women, expressing "a warm welcome to the women representatives from the Great Leap Forward China." She said that the deeds of Chinese women in the Great Leap Forward inspire the construction enthusiasm of Vietnamese women and their will to fight for the unification of their motherland. She said, let the women of our two countries further unite, encourage each other, and better strive for world peace and the happy life of mankind.

Zhang Qian said at the meeting: "Vietnamese women have been tempered in the revolutionary movement of the Vietnamese people and have undergone arduous and heroic struggles. The deeds of many outstanding heroines, as well as the selfless labor of Vietnamese women in construction work, are all familiar to Chinese women. We have always admired the fine qualities of Vietnamese women, who are diligent, brave, and hard-working." She said: We firmly believe that Vietnamese women will definitely be able to exert greater strength and make greater contributions in construction work.

Guo Jian, a member of the Chinese women's delegation and Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, was invited to report on the achievements of Chinese women in the Great Leap Forward. The many vivid examples she cited repeatedly won warm applause from the participants.

The conference ended with the singing of "Unity is Strength" by women from both countries.
