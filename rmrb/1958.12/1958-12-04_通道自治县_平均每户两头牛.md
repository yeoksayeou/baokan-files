    Tongdao Autonomous County – An Average of Two Head of Cattle Per Household
    (Reported by our newspaper) Hunan’s Tongdao Dong Autonomous County has developed its cattle population to more than 33,000 head, averaging 1.5 head per household. By the end of the year, it is expected to reach more than 40,000 head, averaging two head per household, setting a red flag for cattle breeding. In this county, cattle are not only self-sufficient but also available to support other areas. During the deep plowing campaign, 3,000 strong cattle were selected to support Han farmers in the plains and hilly areas.
    Tongdao Dong Autonomous County is located on the border of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, a high and cold mountainous area. The Dong people who live here have a tradition of raising cattle, and each village has an artificially cultivated "cattle-raising slope" – a grassy slope. However, in the past, due to the habit of letting cattle graze freely without dedicated care, many died of cold, starvation, falls, and tiger attacks every year, and the development of cattle was very slow. This year, with strengthened feeding management, the cattle population increased by 13,000 head in one year, a threefold increase compared to 1950, and twice as much as the large-scale development in 1957.
    Tongdao has fewer people and more land, with an average of four mu of paddy fields per laborer and countless mountain soils. Cultivation has always been extensive, with an average yield of 100 to 200 jin per mu. Due to the large-scale development of cattle, cattle have replaced human labor in carrying burdens, liberating human resources, and thus this year's production has greatly developed. The county's 210,000 mu of fields have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of more than 1,000 jin per mu. This historically grain-deficient high and cold mountainous area has become a surplus grain county.
    Why has the development of cattle in Tongdao been so rapid? The primary reason is the importance attached to it by the Party Committee and its tight grasp on the issue. The County Party Committee regards breeding cattle as an important part of leading the great leap forward in production. The county, township, and commune established livestock production committees and cattle breeding committees, trained a large number of breeding personnel, feeders, and veterinarians, built breeding farms, and launched a mass movement to develop cattle.
    Strengthening technical guidance and feeding management is another important reason for the great development of cattle. The county's feeders, breeders, and veterinarians have all been trained, and everyone has learned artificial estrus induction and the use of local medicines for estrus induction, enabling repeated mating, double mating, and blood mating, so that the mating rate of cows reaches 93%, 100% pregnancy, and two calves per year. In terms of feeding management, methods such as grouping pregnant cows for grazing and dedicated care are implemented to ensure that the cows are strong and the calves are well-fed and grow quickly after birth. This year, the county will strive for 100% success in cow mating, pregnancy, calving, and calf rearing, making Tongdao a national advanced county in breeding livestock.

### 通道自治县——平均每户两头牛

    通道自治县——平均每户两头牛
    本报讯  湖南通道侗族自治县的耕牛已发展到三万三千多头，平均每户一头半，年底即可达到四万多头，平均每户两头，树起了繁殖耕牛的红旗。在这个县耕牛不但自给有余，而且可以支援外地。在这次深翻地运动中，就挑出力大、体壮的耕牛三千头，支援了平原、丘陵地区的汉族农民。
    通道侗族自治县位于湘、桂、黔三省边境，是一个高寒山区。居住在这里的侗族人民历来有饲养耕牛的习惯，每个村寨都有人工培育的“养牛坡”——草坡。但是，过去由于习惯放野牛，没有专人照管，每年冻死、饿死、跌死和被老虎咬死的很多，耕牛发展很慢。今年加强了饲养管理，一年增殖一万三千头，较1950年增加三倍，比大发展的1957年还多两倍。
    通道人少田土多，每个劳动力平均四亩水田，还有无数山土，历来耕作粗放，平均亩产一至二百斤。由于耕牛大发展，用牛代替了人力肩挑背负，解放了人力，因而今年生产有了很大发展。全县二十一万亩田土获得亩产一千多斤的空前大丰收。这个历来缺粮的高寒山区已经变成了余粮县。
    通道的耕牛为什么会这样高速度地发展呢？首要的原因是党委重视，抓得紧。县委把繁殖耕牛当作领导生产大跃进的一个重要环节。县、乡、社分别成立了畜牧生产委员会、耕牛配种委员会，训练了大批的配种员、饲养员和兽医，建造了配种场，掀起了群众性的发展耕牛运动。
    加强技术指导和饲养管理，是耕牛大发展的另一重要原因。全县的饲养员、配种员和兽医都经过训练，大家都学会了人工催情和用土药催情的办法，可以实行复配、双配、血配，使母牛配种率达到93％，百分之百的满怀，并且达到一年两胎。在饲养管理方面，实行了怀胎母牛分群牧放，专人照管等办法，保证母牛健壮，小牛生下后就吃得饱，长得快。今年，全县将在母牛配种、怀仔、产仔、养仔等方面争取四个百分之百，使通道成为全国繁殖耕畜的先进县。
