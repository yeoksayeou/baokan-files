    It's Good to Run Schools in Workshops
    Wen Jin
    Large-scale factories and mining enterprises have large sites, numerous people, many types of work, and are scattered. Production is also relatively complex. In the past, workers were concentrated in only one or two large spare-time schools in the entire factory or mine for study, which was certainly a method, but relying solely on this method is not enough because large factories and mines have their own particularities. For example, the production time between different types of work is inconsistent, making it difficult to arrange unified schedules. Concentrating in one or two places often leads to absenteeism for some workers due to long distances and other reasons. Adopting the method of running schools in workshops allows each workshop to flexibly arrange the time and place for employees' spare-time learning based on the specific circumstances, making up for the shortcomings of large-scale, factory-wide spare-time schools. Therefore, running schools in workshops is very necessary in large factories and mining enterprises, and it is an important method for deeply mobilizing the masses to run schools.
    The workshop is a production link, and it can also be said to be an education link. Running schools in workshops has many benefits. First, it facilitates mobilizing the enthusiasm of grassroots workshop cadres to grasp education, and it facilitates properly and flexibly resolving many specific issues, such as combining teaching with production, based on the specific characteristics of each workshop's production and workers' lives. Once these problems are properly resolved, the workers' enthusiasm for learning will also be enhanced, and it will be possible to ensure no absenteeism.
    To do a good job in running schools in workshops, the key issue lies in the leadership's emphasis. Leaders at all levels of factories and mining enterprises must put politics in command and pay attention to solving the ideological problems of grassroots workshop cadres. Currently, some grassroots cadres still do not sufficiently recognize the significance of spare-time education. They often emphasize that production is busy, so there is no way to engage in education, believing that it is difficult to grasp both production and education. These comrades value production and are wholeheartedly dedicated to doing a good job in production, which is a good aspiration. The problem lies in their belief that engaging in production precludes engaging in education, and engaging in education precludes production, setting production and education against each other. In fact, if the workshop's spare-time education is closely integrated with actual production, the results of learning will greatly promote technological revolution, leading to a greater leap forward in production. At the same time, they do not understand that our factories produce two kinds of products: one is the non-speaking material product, and the other is the speaking "product," which is the cultivation of educated laborers. All factories must not only strive to produce material products and create new products, but also strive to cultivate new communist people. Only in this way can production development be greatly promoted. Neglecting the education of people, "seeing things but not people," is incorrect. As long as the leadership effectively takes charge, some difficulties in running schools can be readily solved.

    车间办学好
    文津
    大型厂矿企业，厂地大，人数多，工种多而且分散，生产也比较复杂。工人们过去集中在全厂矿仅有的一两个大型业余学校学习，这固然是一种方法，但仅仅依靠这一种方法就不够，因为大型厂矿有它的特殊性。譬如各工种之间生产的时间不一致，统一安排时间比较困难；集中在一两处，有些工人因为路途远等多种原因，往往缺课。采取车间办学的办法，各车间就可以根据具体情况，灵活地安排职工业余学习的时间和地点，弥补全厂矿性的大型业余学校之不足。因此，在大型厂矿企业里，车间办学就十分必要，这是深入发动群众办学的一个重要方法。
    车间是生产环节，也可以说是教育环节。车间办学的好处很多。首先便于调动车间基层干部抓教育的积极性，便于根据各车间生产和工人生活的具体特点，妥善灵活地解决教学结合生产等许多具体问题。这些问题一经妥善解决，工人的学习热情也就会提高，并有可能保证不缺课。
    要搞好车间办学，关键问题在于领导上重视。各级厂矿企业领导要政治挂帅，注意解决车间基层干部的思想问题。目前有些基层干部对业余教育的意义还认识不足，他们常常强调生产忙，没法搞教育，认为既抓生产，又抓教育有困难。这些同志重视生产，一心想把生产搞好，这个愿望是好的。问题在于他们认为搞生产就不能搞教育，搞教育就不能生产，把生产和教育对立起来了。其实，车间的业余教育如果密切结合生产实际，学习的结果将大大推动技术革命，使生产有更大的跃进。同时，他们不理解：我们工厂生产的产品有两种：一种是不讲话的物质的产品，一种是会说话的“产品”，后者就是培养有文化的劳动者。所有的工厂不仅要努力生产物质的产品和创造新产品，还需要努力培养共产主义的新人，也只有这样才能大大地促进生产的发展。忽视人的教育工作，“见物不见人”，是不对的。只要领导上切实地抓起来，办学中的一些困难就可以迎刃而解。
