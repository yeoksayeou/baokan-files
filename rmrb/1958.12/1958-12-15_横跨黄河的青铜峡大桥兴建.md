    Construction Begins on Qingtongxia Bridge Across the Yellow River
    The first steel bridge spanning the Yellow River in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region—the Qingtongxia Bridge—has recently begun construction. The bridge's No. 3 and No. 4 piers have been floated and positioned, and workers are currently driving piles.
    This steel bridge is located at the center of the Qingtongxia water conservancy project and is 286 meters long. The bridge piers are of wooden construction, and the bridge deck is made of steel. It is a semi-permanent structure. According to the plan, railway tracks will be laid on the bridge, with wooden planks on both sides, allowing both trains and automobiles to pass. Once completed, it will connect the Xihekou Station of the Qingtongxia railway branch line to the west and the Wu (Wuzhong City)-Qing (Qingtongxia) railway to the east, linking the eastern and western regions of the Yellow River within the autonomous region. This will change the current situation where the east and west banks of the river mainly rely on wooden boats and sheepskin rafts to transport materials, greatly improving the efficiency of local material transportation.

    横跨黄河的青铜峡大桥兴建
    宁夏回族自治区境内的第一座横跨黄河的钢桥——青铜峡大桥最近动工兴建。这座大桥的三号、四号桥墩已经先后浮运下水，工人们正在定位打桩。
    这座钢桥位于青铜峡水利枢纽工程的中心，全长二百八十六公尺，桥墩为木质结构，桥面由钢材架成，为半永久性建筑。按照计划，桥上将铺设铁轨，两侧铺设木板，使火车和汽车都可通行。它建成后，将西接青铜峡铁路支线的西河口车站，东连吴（吴忠市）青（青铜峡）铁路，使自治区境内黄河东西地区联成一片，将改变目前河东、西两岸主要依靠木船和羊皮筏子调运物资的状况，大大提高当地物资调运的效率。
