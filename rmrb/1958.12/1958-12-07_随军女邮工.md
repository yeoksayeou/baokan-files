    Female Postal Worker Serving with the Troops

    The "Steel Battlefield News" on the iron and steel front in Hekou District, Shanxi, published a report entitled "Female Postal Worker Serving with the Troops," which wrote:
      "Li Linzhi, a little girl,
    Is active day and night on the iron and steel front.
    She fears not the cold wind,
    Nor minds the chilling rain;
    Sweating all over,
    She says it's like taking a bath.
    If someone wants to mail a letter,
    Her little hands are quick and busy!
    If you ask her to remit money, she'll ask about the amount, address, and name in detail.
    She never tires of answering questions and is attentive, with strong service capabilities.
    She transmits news of abundant production to the worksite,
    And sends songs of triumph in steel production back to her hometown.
    This female postal worker serving with the troops on the battlefield,
    Does her work exceptionally well,
    Through her, we are encouraged and add to our drive,
    Quickly dig, quickly transport, and smelt more iron to produce more steel."

    What kind of person is Li Linzhi?
    She is a young girl who just turned fifteen, and only started working in the postal and telecommunications sector in September of this year. She joined the work force just in time for the nationwide upsurge in iron and steel production. The Taiyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, in order to support the steel commander's ascension, organized field post offices to serve various iron and steel construction sites. Li Linzhi was assigned to the Xinglinping field post office on the Hekou iron and steel front. She arrives at the construction site every day at around seven o'clock. Some of the steel warriors buy newspapers and magazines, and others ask her, "Do you have any mail for me?" Little Li always asks for the name with a smile, and hands over the letters to the recipients one by one. She never makes mistakes when asked to mail letters or remit money. After finishing work in one place, she carries the heavy mailbag to another construction site. She tirelessly travels for the steel warriors day and night, rain or shine. After finishing her postal work, she sits down and works with everyone to smash ore and make crucibles, laboring happily, as if she doesn't know what tiredness is.
    She regards the construction site as her home, and the steel warriors cherish her like a little sister. When the cafeteria makes something good to eat, everyone always wants to leave some for her to eat together. Someone said enviously: "Little Li is really popular!" But what is popularity? It's just because she serves everyone wholeheartedly and has established a deep affection with the steel warriors in the course of labor. (Wen Tingxiu)

    随军女邮工
    在山西河口区钢铁前线的“钢铁战地报”上，登有一篇“随军女邮工”的报道，写道：
      “李林枝，小姑娘，
    昼夜活跃在钢铁阵地上。
    风吹不怕冷，
    雨淋不嫌凉；
    累出一身汗，
    她说和洗澡一个样。
    谁要寄封信，
    她那小手快又忙！
    你要托他汇笔款，款数、地址、姓名问周详。百问不厌态度好，服务周到能力强。她把丰产消息传到工地，
    又把钢铁凯歌寄往家乡。
    这个战地随军女邮工，
    工作做得实在强，
    通过她我们受到鼓舞添干劲，
    快挖、快运、多炼生铁多产钢。”
    李林枝是怎样一个人呢？
    她是个刚满十五岁的小姑娘，今年9月才参加邮电工作。她一参加工作就正赶上全民大搞钢铁的热潮。太原邮电局为支援钢帅升帐，组织了野战邮局，到各钢铁工地服务。李林枝被派到河口钢铁战线杏林坪野战邮局。她每天七点多钟就来到工地上。钢铁战士们有的买报刊，有的问她：“有没有我的信？”小李总笑嬉嬉地问清姓名，把信一一交给收件人。托她寄信或汇款，从来不会出错。在一个地方工作完了后，就背起沉重的信袋转向另一个工地去。她就是这样日日夜夜风雨无阻地为钢铁战士们奔波。在办完邮政工作以后，她就坐下来和大家一起砸矿石，做坩埚，愉快地劳动着，好像不知道什么是累。
    她看工地如家，钢铁战士也像爱护小妹妹一样爱护她。食堂里要做什么好吃的，大家总要留她一起吃。有人羡慕地说：“小李真有人缘！”其实什么是人缘呢？只是因为她热诚地为大家服务，和钢铁战士们在劳动中建立了深厚的感情罢了。  （温廷琇）
