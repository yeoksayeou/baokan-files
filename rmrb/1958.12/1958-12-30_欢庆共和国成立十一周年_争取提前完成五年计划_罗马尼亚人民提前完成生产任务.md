Celebrating the 11th Anniversary of the Republic's Founding; Striving to Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
Romanian People Complete Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule

(Reported by this newspaper) On the occasion of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic, we are excited to see that all parts of Romania are stepping up construction to strive to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The petroleum and chemical industries are the focus of Romania's industrial development. At present, explorers are exploring new oil layers and discovering new natural gas deposits throughout the country. Many chemical plants, such as the Roznov Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, the "Govora" and "Borzești" Chemical Plants, and the First Synthetic Rubber Plant, are under construction. This year, Romania exported 83 kinds of chemical industrial products to 38 countries. Next year, the industry will be further developed, with investment in this area accounting for 20% of the total national economic investment, an increase of 50% compared to this year.

In the Bicaz region of eastern Romania, the construction of the "Lenin" Hydropower Station is proceeding apace. Its power generation capacity is 210,000 kilowatts, and it is a key project in Romania's ten-year electrification plan (1951-1960). In the eight years since the implementation of the electrification plan, Romania has built 24 power stations. By the end of 1957, the country's total power generation capacity had increased from 740,000 kilowatts in 1950 to 1.44 million kilowatts, and the number of electrified farms had increased from 450 to 2,200.

At present, large-scale housing construction is underway in both cities and villages in Romania. Large groups of residential buildings, including thousands of housing units, are being built in the center of Bucharest. A large number of workers' residences are being built in the centers of industrial enterprise construction, such as Moldavia, Transylvania, and Dobruja. In addition, nurseries, hospitals, and other buildings are also being continuously constructed.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 29th: The working people of Romania are using practical actions of completing and overfulfilling production tasks ahead of schedule to welcome the 11th anniversary of the abolition of the monarchy and the declaration of the founding of the People's Republic of Romania (December 30th).

Among the units that first completed the annual production plan are the petroleum industry and chemical industry departments. As of November 16, the staff of these departments had completed 101.65% of the annual plan. On November 17, fifteen enterprises in the Hungarian Autonomous Region completed the annual production plan, eight of which are enterprises of national significance. Workers at the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Iron and Steel Complex" in Hunedoara overfulfilled the annual production plan and saved more than 8 million lei. The metal they saved can be used to produce 6,000 tractors or 3,000 combine harvesters.

This year, socialist emulation campaigns have been widely carried out in various regions, and more and more workers and industrial departments have participated in the competitions. Workers at the "Semanatoarea" factory have achieved particularly great results, completing the annual plan at the end of October. In the first ten months of this year, they produced twice as many combine harvesters as in the entire previous year.

This year, Romania manufactured twice as many tractors as in 1955, and the supply of machinery and agricultural implements to agriculture has also increased by two and a half times. Due to the scientific organization of production, labor productivity in the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry has increased by 87% compared to 1955.

At the end of November, thirty-one enterprises in light industry completed the annual plan. Workers producing building materials have over-produced 72,000 tons of cement and 15 million bricks in eleven and a half months, and saved 27 million lei.

The farmers are also welcoming this holiday victoriously. State-owned farms in Oradea have so far over-produced 200,000 kilograms of meat. (Attached picture)

    欢庆共和国成立十一周年  争取提前完成五年计划
    罗马尼亚人民提前完成生产任务
    本报讯  在罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十一周年的日子里，我们兴奋地看到罗马尼亚全国各地都在加紧建设，争取提前完成第二个五年计划。
    石油和化学工业是罗马尼亚工业发展的重心。目前，勘探工作者正在各地探测新的石油层，发掘新的天然气苗，许许多多的化学工厂，如罗兹诺夫氮肥工厂、“戈沃拉”和“博尔泽斯蒂”化学工厂、第一人造橡胶工厂等正在兴建中。今年罗马尼亚同三十八个国家输出了八十三种化学工业品。明年，工业将会得到更大的发展，在这方面的投资将占国民经济投资总额的20％，即比今年增加50％。
    在罗马尼亚东部毕卡兹地区的“列宁”水电站建筑工程正在加紧进行中。它的发电能力为二十一万瓩，是罗马尼亚十年电气化计划（1951—1960）的重点工程。在实施电气化计划的八年中，罗马尼亚已建成二十四个发电站，到1957年底全国发电量已由1950年的七十四万瓩增加到一百四十四万瓩，电气化农庄已由四百五十个增加到二千二百个。
    目前，无论在罗马尼亚的城市和乡村里，都在大规模兴建住宅，在布加勒斯特中心正在建造大型成组的包括数千套住房的住宅。在工业企业建设的中心，如摩尔达维亚、德兰斯瓦尼亚和多布鲁查正在兴建大批的工人住宅。此外，托儿所、医院等建筑也在不断兴建中。
    新华社布加勒斯特29日电  罗马尼亚劳动人民以提前和超额完成生产任务的实际行动，来迎接罗马尼亚废除君主制宣布成立人民共和国十一周年（12月30日）。
    在最先完成年度生产计划的单位中间有：石油工业和化学工业部门。到11月16日止，这些部门的工作人员完成了年度计划的101.65％。11月17日，匈牙利民族自治州的十五个企业完成了年度生产计划，其中有八个是具有全国意义的企业。洪尼多阿拉“乔治乌—德治钢铁联合工厂”的工人超额完成了年度生产计划，节约了八百多万列伊。用他们所节约的金属可以生产六千部拖拉机或者三千部收获联合机。
    今年，社会主义竞赛在各地广泛开展，参加竞赛的劳动者和工业部门越来越多。“塞马纳托阿里亚”工厂的工人取得了特别大的成就，他们在10月底就完成了年度计划。在今年头十个月中，他们生产出来的收获联合机比去年全年多两倍。
    今年，罗马尼亚制造出来的拖拉机比1955年多一倍，供给农业的机器和农具也增加了两倍半。由于在科学的基础上组织生产，农业机器制造工业中的劳动生产率比1955年
  提高了87％。
    11月底，轻工业有三十一个企业完成了年度计划。生产建筑材料的工人在十一个半月来超计划生产了七万二千吨水泥、一千五百万块砖，并且节约了二千七百万列伊。
    农民们也是胜利地迎接这个节日。俄拉第亚州的国营农场到目前为止超计划生产了二十万公斤肉类。（附图片）
