　　People Make Indigenous Chemical Fertilizer, Peasants Accumulate Farm Manure

　　(Our report) The Dongfeng People's Commune in Lanjia County, Hunan Province (originally the merged counties of Lanshan and Jiahe), while vigorously developing indigenous chemical fertilizers, strongly refuted the "limited source of farm manure" theory, opened up forty kinds of fertilizer sources, and achieved: mass production of chemical fertilizers, people accumulating indigenous fertilizers, people collecting wild manure, people managing household manure and green manure, and every field having a manure pit.

　　In order to prepare sufficient fertilizer for next year, the Dongfeng Commune Party Committee, after the autumn harvest and planting, seized the opportunity to organize indigenous chemical fertilizer professional teams, each team building an indigenous chemical fertilizer plant, and vigorously producing indigenous chemical fertilizers. However, while vigorously developing indigenous chemical fertilizers, the commune members neglected the collection and storage of farm manure, leaking toilets were left unroofed, excrement was left uncollected, wild manure was left unpicked, and pig and cattle manure was left unremoved from the pens. The Commune Party Committee analyzed the reasons for this phenomenon: on the one hand, commune cadres relaxed their leadership in the production and accumulation of farm manure while focusing on indigenous chemical fertilizer production; on the other hand, some cadres and masses held the "limited source of fertilizer" theory, saying, "There is no fertilizer to accumulate in the cold winter, and withered yellow grass has no fertilizer effect." Some believed that it was enough to produce indigenous chemical fertilizer and that digging pond mud and turf was useless. The Commune Party Committee organized cadres and the masses to conduct airing-of-views and debates targeting the above ideas. Through debate, everyone identified more than forty kinds of fertilizer sources, such as digging turf, pond mud, river mud, ditch mud, and dismantling wall mud, breaking the "limited source of fertilizer" theory. At the same time, through debate, everyone realized that farm manure such as human and animal excrement, river mud, turf, and pond mud are organic fertilizers, and chemical fertilizers are inorganic fertilizers, and inorganic fertilizers must be used in combination with organic fertilizers to better exert their fertilizer effect. On the basis of unified ideological understanding, the Commune Party Committee established a manure accumulation headquarters, led by the secretary, and properly arranged the labor force. One hand grasped the manufacture of indigenous chemical fertilizer, and the other hand grasped the accumulation and production of household manure. In addition to assigning dedicated personnel to produce indigenous chemical fertilizers, and organizing 450 semi-laborers to collect wild manure, the commune also arranged a certain proportion of the labor force to accumulate fertilizer, compost fertilizer, cultivate green manure, and repair toilets and cattle and pig pens. After taking these measures, the manure accumulation and production movement progressed rapidly. (Zuo Zeyin)

    土化肥有人造  农家肥有人积
    本报讯  湖南省蓝嘉县（原蓝山、嘉禾两县合并）东风公社，在大抓土化肥的同时，大破农家肥料“肥源有限论”，开辟了肥源四十种，做到了：化肥大量造，土肥有人积，野粪有人拾，家肥、绿肥有人管，丘丘田有满肥凼。
    东风公社党委为了给明年准备足够的肥料，秋收秋种后，就抓紧时机，组织土化肥专业队，队队建土化肥厂，大力生产土化肥。可是在大抓土化肥的同时，社员们却忽视了对农家肥的收集和保管，厕所漏了无人盖，屎尿满地无人挑，野粪满地无人拣，猪牛粪满栏无人出。公社党委分析出现这样现象的原因：一方面是社干部在抓土化肥生产时，放松了对农家造肥积肥的领导；另一方面是部分干部和群众中存在“肥源有限论”，他们说：“冬寒水冷无肥积，野草枯黄没有肥效。”有的认为只要搞土化肥就够了，挑塘泥、挖草皮不顶事。公社党委针对以上思想，组织干部和群众进行了鸣放辩论。通过辩论，大家找出了挖地皮、塘泥、河泥、阴沟泥、拆墙泥等四十多种肥源，打破了“肥源有限论”。同时通过辩论，大家认识了：人畜粪尿、河泥、草皮、塘泥等农家肥是有机肥料，化学肥料是无机肥料，无机肥料必须与有机肥结合使用，才能更好地发挥肥效。在统一思想认识的基础上，公社党委成立了积肥指挥部，书记挂帅，妥善安排了劳力。一手抓制造土化肥，一手抓积造家肥。社里除固定专人制土化肥，组织了四百五十个半劳力拾野粪以外，全社还安排了一定比例的劳力积肥、沤肥，培育绿肥，整修厕所、牛猪栏。采取这些措施以后，积肥造肥运动进展很快。  （左泽荫）
