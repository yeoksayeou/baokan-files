Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 3rd: News from Hong Kong: In recent years, American special agents have been very rampant in the rural areas and fishing areas of Hong Kong, using deception, incitement, and bribery to carry out conspiracy activities against China among some villagers and fishermen. Recently, local villagers and fishermen have been exposing this situation.
Since 1956, the United States has intensified its efforts to assign special agents to the "New Territories Rural Committee," which has a thirty-two-year history, and the "Rural Affairs Committees" of various villages, attempting to seize these organizations as tools for deceiving villagers, undermining their interests, and opposing China.

At the same time, American special agents have also opened some "schools," "churches," and "orphanages" in the villages of Hong Kong, which are entirely run by Americans. Under the guise of education, religion, and welfare, they are carrying out very blatant anti-China activities among the villagers. According to villagers, American special agents use these organizations to frequently spread rumors slandering China in the villages, discredit China's rural cooperatives and people's commune system, try their best to provoke the local villagers' dissatisfaction with the motherland, and carry out the work of recruiting special agents. American special agents also often use these organizations to distribute American reactionary publications and show American reactionary films to the villagers. Many Americans also wear the guise of "teachers" and "pastors," visiting door-to-door in the villages, investigating the situation of the local villagers, and enticing and deceiving them to join special agent organizations. These Americans are very rampant in Tsuen Wan.

The American special agent organs have also allocated a sum of "activity funds" specifically for provoking discord among the villagers and creating disputes between villages. Many facts prove that many of the disputes between villages that have occurred in the rural areas of Hong Kong since this year have been secretly provoked by American special agents.

American special agents are even more rampant in their activities among fishermen. Special, overt or semi-overt special agent organs have been set up in the seven fishing areas of Aberdeen, Cheung Chau, Tai O, Shau Kei Wan, Tai Po, Sai Kung, and Castle Peak.

On August 19th of this year, a group of American special agents near Po Toi Island in Hong Kong, impersonating our People's Navy, armed and robbed several motorized fishing boats and a sailboat, attempting to use this despicable means to frame others and provoke the fishermen's dissatisfaction with the motherland. According to fishermen present at the scene, one of the American special agent ships impersonating the People's Navy was the "Black Cat Ship" registered in Hong Kong. Local villagers and fishermen pointed out that the rampant activities of American special agent organs in the rural areas and fishing areas of Hong Kong in recent years reflect that the United States is attempting to intensify the use of Hong Kong as a base against China.

    美国加紧利用香港为反对我国基地
    特务分子在香港乡村和渔区大肆活动
    新华社广州3日电  香港消息：近年来美国特务在香港的乡村地区和渔区中活动很猖獗，在一部分乡民和渔民中，用欺骗、煽动和收买的办法，进行反对中国的阴谋活动。最近，当地的乡民和渔民纷纷揭发这方面的情况。
    1956年以来，美国就加紧指派特务，前往具有三十二年历史的“新界乡议局”和各乡的“乡事委员会”中进行活动，企图夺取这些组织，作为欺骗乡民、破坏乡民利益和反对中国的工具。
    与此同时，美国特务还在香港的乡村中开办一些完全由美国人主持的“学校”、“教堂”和“孤儿院”，打着教育、宗教和福利的幌子，在乡民中进行着非常露骨的反对中国的活动。据乡民揭露，美国特务利用这些组织，经常在乡村中散播诬蔑中国的谣言，诋毁中国农村的合作社和人民公社制度，极力挑拨当地乡民对祖国不满情绪，并且进行收买特务的工作。美国特务还经常通过这些组织向乡民散发美国的反动刊物，放映美国的反动电影。不少美国人还披着“教师”、“牧师”的外衣，在乡村中逐户探访，调查当地乡民的情况，利诱、欺骗乡民参加特务组织，这些美国人在荃湾活动很猖狂。
    美国特务机关还拨出一笔“活动费”专门用以对乡民进行挑拨离间，制造乡村间的纠纷。有许多事实证明，今年以来在香港乡村地区发生的村与村之间的纠纷。有许多是被美国特务暗中拨挑起来的。
    美国特务在渔民中的活动更加猖獗，在香港仔、长洲、大澳、筲箕湾、大埔、西贡、青山等七个渔区，都设有专门的公开或半公开的特务机关。
    今年8月19日，一批美国特务在香港蒲台岛附近，冒充我人民海军，武装抢劫了几艘机动渔船和一艘帆船，企图用这种卑劣的手段嫁祸与人，挑起渔民对祖国的不满。据在场的渔民揭露，在这些冒充人民海军的美国特务船只中，有一艘就是在香港登记的“黑猫船”。当地的乡民和渔民指出：美国特务机关近年来在香港乡村地区和渔区中的猖獗活动，反映出美国正企图加紧利用香港作为反对中国的基地。
