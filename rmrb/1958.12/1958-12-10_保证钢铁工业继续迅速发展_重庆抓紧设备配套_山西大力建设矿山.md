Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 7th: Chongqing's mechanical industry departments are taking urgent measures to vigorously expedite the assembly of mechanical equipment, ensuring that machinery like iron smelting and steel rolling equipment are put into production on schedule.

    In order to change the situation of incomplete mechanical equipment sets, relevant departments first inspected the completion of equipment for iron smelting, steel rolling, power generation, and so on. They specifically cataloged missing accessories, components, and parts, and rearranged production. For example, the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory manufactured a batch of rolling mills two months ago, but they could not be put into production due to a lack of matching turbines. Now, relevant parties have organized more than a dozen mechanical factories to process and rush the manufacture of turbines. The installation of a boiler requires more than twenty kinds of accessories such as gate valves, and it would be difficult to complete the task relying solely on the originally assigned factories. After relevant departments promptly organized more than a dozen units to assist in production, the boiler assembly problem has been basically resolved.

    The Chongqing Municipal Mechanical Industry Department recently also convened a meeting of responsible persons from equipment manufacturing and production units, as well as relevant engineering and technical personnel, to jointly study how to simplify some overly complex parts and accessories of mechanical equipment, while ensuring the basic performance of the products, in order to accelerate equipment assembly. For example, the boiler's water injection equipment originally used a steam pump, but the manufacturing time for steam pumps was very long and could not meet the needs of rapid assembly. They decided to replace the steam pump with a water ejector. This not only greatly shortened the manufacturing time of the water injection equipment and accelerated boiler assembly, but also saved raw materials. The original design for the electrical part accessories of the rolling mill had fourteen types, but after careful study, it has been simplified to seven types.

    Relevant units have strengthened mutual assistance and collaboration in assembly production. The weakest links in assembly production are the sand casting and forging departments. After the city held a meeting to strengthen collaboration, units that already had heavy tasks, such as the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory and the Chongqing Wangjiang Machinery Factory, voluntarily processed forgings and castings for other factories.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 9th: In order to ensure the need for iron ore for the accelerated development of large and medium-sized iron and steel complexes, Shanxi Province has begun large-scale mine construction work. Among the newly built large mines are 19 locations including the B соответствующийji Mountain Mine in northern Jin, the Ta'er Mountain Mine and Heilongguan Mine in southern Jin, the Hekou Gujiao Mine in the suburbs of Taiyuan, and the Liujiagou Mine in central Jin. The iron ore reserves generally range from several million tons to hundreds of millions of tons. The larger B соответствующийji Mountain Mine has already gathered 15,000 people and construction has begun. The Ta'er Mountain Mine, which started construction earlier, has already mined tens of thousands of tons of ore.

    Shanxi Province's iron and steel industry has developed rapidly in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward this year. The total output value of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, one of the national key iron and steel enterprises, increased more than threefold in 1957 compared to 1952, and this year's output will increase by another fold compared to last year. The Yangquan Iron Plant, which originally produced only tens of thousands of tons of iron a year, has now expanded to produce hundreds of thousands of tons a year; the Guxian Iron Plant, which few people knew about before, is also gradually developing into an iron and steel base. The output of these iron and steel enterprises will have even greater increases next year. In the past, most of the ore used by these iron and steel enterprises was transported from Hebei, Guangxi, Jiangsu and other places, which was not only expensive in terms of freight, but also often caused supply delays. After the whole people engaged in steelmaking on a large scale this year, the supply of ore has become even more tense, and self-reliance in mining ore has become an urgent problem to be solved for the current development of Shanxi Province's iron and steel industry.

    Shanxi Province is rich in mineral resources, with a total iron ore reserve of several billion tons. Some mines can be open-pit mined, and some mining areas have concentrated mineral deposits, making them relatively easy to mine. Based on this situation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to immediately start mining large mines and establish relatively large raw material bases for iron and steel enterprises to ensure the needs of large and medium-sized iron and steel enterprises.

    保证钢铁工业继续迅速发展
    重庆抓紧设备配套  山西大力建设矿山
    据新华社重庆7日电  重庆市机械工业部门采取紧急措施，大抓机械设备配套工作，保证炼铁、轧钢等机械设备按期投入生产。
    为了改变机械设备不成套的情况，有关部门首先检查了炼铁、轧钢、发电等设备的完成情况，缺少的附件、配件和零件都进行了具体排队，重新安排了生产。例如重庆机床厂早在两个月前就制造好了一批轧钢机，但因缺乏汽轮机配套，不能投入生产。现在有关方面组织了十几个机械厂，正在加工赶制汽轮机。安装一台锅炉就需要闸阀等二十多种配件，单靠原来安排的几个厂生产很难完成。经有关部门及时组织了十多个单位协助生产以后，锅炉的配套问题已得到基本解决。
    重庆市机械工业部门最近还召开了设备制造单位和生产使用单位的负责人及有关工程技术人员的会议，共同研究如何在保证产品基本性能的条件下，简化机械设备的一些过于复杂的零、附件，以加速设备配套。例如锅炉的加水设备，原来用蒸汽泵，但蒸汽泵的制造时间很长，不能满足迅速的配套需要。他们就决定用射水器来代替蒸汽泵。这样不仅大大缩短了加水设备的制造时间，加速了锅炉的配套，同时还节省了原材料。轧钢机电动部分的附件原设计是十四种，经过仔细研究以后，已简化成七种。
    有关单位都加强了配套生产的互助协作。配套生产中最薄弱的环节是翻砂和锻造部门，市里召开加强协作的会议后，任务本来就很重的重庆空气压缩机厂、重庆望江机器厂等单位都主动为别厂加工锻、铸件。
    据新华社太原9日电  为了保证大、中型钢铁联合企业加速发展对于铁矿石的需要，山西省开始进行大规模的矿山建设工作。新建的大矿中，有晋北的簸箕山矿，晋南塔儿山矿、黑龙关矿、太原郊区河口古交矿，晋中刘家沟矿等十九处，铁矿藏量一般是几百万吨到几亿吨。规模较大的簸箕山矿已经集中了一万五千人，并已动工建设。建设较早的塔儿山矿已经采出了几万吨矿石。
    山西省钢铁工业在近几年，特别是自今年大跃进以来，发展很快。全国重点钢铁企业之一——太原钢铁公司1957年生产总值比1952年增长了三倍多，今年的产量又将比去年增加一倍。原来一年只生产几万吨铁的阳泉铁厂，现在扩大到一年生产几十万吨；原来很少人知道的故县铁厂，也逐步发展为钢铁基地。这些钢铁企业的产量明年还将有更大的增加。这些钢铁企业所用的矿石，过去大部分从河北、广西、江苏等地运来，不仅运费大，成本高，而且经常供应不及时。在今年全民大办钢铁以后，矿石的供应就更加紧张，自力更生开采矿石就成为当前山西省发展钢铁工业的一个迫切需要解决的问题。
    山西省境内矿藏丰富，铁矿的藏量共有几十亿吨。有些矿可以露天开采，有些矿区矿藏集中，比较容易开采。根据这种情况，中共山西省委决定，立即着手开采大型矿山，建立比较大的钢铁企业原料基地，以保证大中型钢铁企业的需要。
