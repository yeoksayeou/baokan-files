Strive to Consolidate and Expand the Achievements of Literacy Campaigns

In the surging tide of the cultural revolution, China's literacy campaign has achieved tremendous success. After basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in many counties and cities across the country, a new upsurge of marching towards culture and technology has been set off. Cultural and technical schools, "red and expert" schools, and various levels and types of spare-time schools have been established on a large scale. Some factories and people's communes have established part-work, part-study schools for young and middle-aged people. Many places have established adult education systems from low to high levels, enabling those who have just emerged from illiteracy to continue learning. The enthusiasm of the masses for learning is high. In many places, the masses have put forward many ambitious slogans: "The commander doesn't dismount, the soldiers don't leave their saddles, take advantage of the victory to fight fiercely, and sweep up the tail and improve together!" Many places have also launched a wave of reading, writing poetry, and writing books with the slogan "Read a hundred books and write ten thousand words." This is a vibrant and flourishing scene of adult education. The broad masses have gone from being illiterate to becoming literate, and from literacy classes to technical and scientific schools. This is not an ordinary matter, but a great cultural turnaround.

However, it must also be pointed out that at present, some places, some cadres, and some of the masses have a sense of relaxation, thinking that "the literacy task has been completed, we can take a break," "the masses know more than a thousand characters, which is enough for daily life," and they can "dismount." Therefore, in some places, the phenomenon of relapse into illiteracy has reappeared among those who have become literate. The number of people who relapse into illiteracy accounts for an average of 10% to 30% of the number of people who have become literate, and in some places the figure is even higher. This phenomenon cannot be ignored.

Eliminating illiteracy is only the first step towards marching into culture and science. Those who have just emerged from illiteracy are like children who have just learned to walk. They have only learned to recognize a thousand or so characters, and some people can only read and recognize, but cannot write or use them, which is far from meeting the needs of production and daily life. As the masses in some places say: "In the Great Leap Forward, to achieve high yields, it is useless to stare blankly if you don't understand technology, and it is really difficult if you are not educated." In the short term, the masses recognize more than a thousand characters, which is only a preliminary grasp of the tools of culture, which is far from enough. They must study again and improve again to consolidate the achievements of literacy campaigns. From a long-term perspective, we must not only eliminate literacy illiteracy, but also eliminate cultural illiteracy and scientific illiteracy, and improve the cultural and technical level of the workers and peasants to a higher level. This is an extremely important task to gradually eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor. Therefore, vigorously improving the cultural level of the workers and peasants is a serious task in education work. The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on education work pointed out: "We should vigorously develop secondary education and higher education, and strive to basically enable all young people and adults across the country who have the conditions and are willing to receive higher education in about fifteen years." From this, it can be seen that eliminating illiteracy is only the beginning of marching into culture and science. We must have more ambitious goals and higher ideals. If we are satisfied with just eliminating illiteracy and taking the first step, and we want to "dismount" and stop moving forward, then that is not right. The work of eliminating illiteracy must also be constantly revolutionized and constantly advanced.

Since last year, the work of eliminating illiteracy has been carried out in a concentrated and intensive manner. Most illiterate people have reached the literacy standard in a few months or even dozens of days. The learning progress is fast, the time for review and consolidation is short, the production tasks are heavy, and with the mass steelmaking campaign and the realization of communization in rural areas, there have been some changes in the organization of production, and the organization of learning has not kept up in time. Therefore, it is difficult to completely avoid the phenomenon of relapse into illiteracy among some literate people. However, precisely because of this reason, the work of consolidation and improvement is even more important. Learning is like sailing against the current; if you do not advance, you will retreat. After eliminating illiteracy, if the work of consolidation and improvement does not keep up, or if the learning of this group of people is slightly relaxed, the number of people who relapse into illiteracy will continue to expand. This situation should be given sufficient attention. In previous years, there was such a situation that, due to busy production, learning was intermittent, and some people recognized many characters in the first year but did not consolidate them, and had to start from scratch in the following year. Now the masses are very enthusiastic about learning culture, and there are all conditions to prevent the recurrence of this relapse phenomenon. We must strive to consolidate each batch of illiterate people who have become literate, and gradually improve them.

The development of the work of eliminating illiteracy is very uneven. Even within a province or county, the progress is different, some are fast and some are slow. The areas where the literacy campaign is fast have basically eliminated or are close to eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people; the areas where it is slow are still far from the requirements for eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. In different regions, the deployment and requirements of the literacy campaign should be different. The former should focus on consolidation and improvement, combined with sweeping up the tail; the latter should continue to vigorously carry out the literacy campaign, while sweeping and consolidating. How to consolidate and improve? According to the experience of various places, after eliminating illiteracy, it is necessary to immediately establish an educational system from low to high, such as spare-time senior primary schools, middle schools, spare-time cultural and technical schools, and "red and expert" universities; carry out more reading, more writing, and more practice movements to enable literate people to continue learning. The Party committees must strengthen the leadership of this work and seize the planning. The work of eliminating illiteracy and consolidation and improvement must be closely integrated with production, so that learning is wherever production is. Some people think that learning and production cannot be taken care of at the same time, and that they lose sight of one another. When production is tight, spare-time education will be somewhat slack. Yes, the production tasks are indeed very tight, but does this mean that it will definitely affect spare-time education? Not entirely. For example, in the mass steelmaking campaign in Shaanxi Province, in order to consolidate the achievements of the literacy campaign, all kinds of spare-time schools were moved to the top of the mountains and beside the furnaces. Some of them changed the original learning organization into classes organized by military organizations of battalions, companies, and platoons, and studied while working. Chang'an County not only moved the schools to the mountains, but also moved the library to the mountains, providing students with books to borrow at any time, so that more than 40,000 literate young and middle-aged people on the construction site could concentrate on studying for one and a half hours during their rest time every day. This example shows that as long as the Party and government leaders pay attention to spare-time education work, appropriately adjust the organizational form of learning to adapt to the needs of militarization and production, spare-time education can proceed as usual.

It is a remarkable thing to eliminate the large number of illiterate people in our country. However, only by further raising the cultural level of literate people to a higher level can the cultural outlook of the working people in our country be completely changed. This is a glorious and arduous task. Spare-time education workers should, under the leadership of the Party committees in various places, work tirelessly, go all out, make persistent efforts, and continuously leap forward in the work of eliminating illiteracy.

### 努力巩固扩大扫盲成果

    努力巩固扩大扫盲成果
    在澎湃的文化革命浪潮里，我国的扫除文盲运动获得了巨大的成就。全国很多县市在基本上扫除了青壮年文盲之后，紧跟着又掀起了一个向文化技术进军的高潮，各地大办文化技术学校、红专学校、各种各级业余学校，有些工厂和人民公社为青壮年创办了半工半读学校，许多地方已经建立起由低到高的成人教育体系，使刚刚摆脱了文盲状态的人继续学习。广大群众学习热情高涨，不少地方的群众提出许多豪迈的口号：“帅不下马，兵不离鞍、乘胜猛战，扫尾提高齐向前”；许多地方还掀起了“读百本书，写万个字”的读书、写诗、写书的热潮。这是一幅成人教育朝气蓬勃、蒸蒸日上的繁荣景象。广大群众由目不识丁到脱盲，由识字班到技术、科学学校，这不是一件通常的事情，而是文化的大翻身。
    但是，也必须指出，目前某些地方、某些干部和群众当中有一种松劲思想，认为“扫盲任务完成了，可以歇歇了”，“群众认识了千多字，日常生活够用就算了”，可以“下马了”。因此有些地方脱盲的人中又出现回生复盲现象，回生复盲的人数平均占脱盲人数的10％到30％，有的地方甚至比这个数字还要高。这种现象是不可忽视的。
    扫除文盲只是向文化科学进军的第一步。刚刚脱离文盲状态的人犹如刚学会走路的小孩一样，他们仅仅学会认一千几百个字，有些人只会读、会认，还不会写、不会用，远远不能满足生产和日常生活的需要。有的地方的群众不是这样说吗：“大跃进，搞丰产，不懂技术干瞪眼，文化不高真困难。”从眼前来说，群众认识千多字，只是初步掌握了文化的工具，还很不够用，必须再学习、再提高，才能巩固扫盲成果；从长远着眼，我们不仅要扫识字盲，还要扫文化盲、科学盲，把工农群众的文化技术水平提高到更高的水平。这是逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间差别的极为重要的工作。因此，大力提高工农群众的文化水平，是教育工作中的一项严重任务。中共中央和国务院关于教育工作的指示中指出：“应当大力发展中等教育和高等教育，争取在十五年左右的时间内，基本上做到使全国青年和成年，凡是有条件的和自愿的，都可以受到高等教育。”由此可见，扫除文盲只是向文化科学进军的开端，我们要有更远大的目标，有更高的理想，如果刚扫除了文盲，刚迈开第一步就满足了，就要“下马”，止步不前，那就不对了。扫除文盲工作也要不断革命，不断前进。
    从去年开始，扫除文盲工作是在集中突击的方式下进行的，大多数文盲是在几个月甚至几十天内达到扫盲标准的。学习进度快，复习巩固时间少，生产任务重，加之全民大炼钢铁和农村实现公社化，生产组织有若干变动，学习组织没有及时跟上去，因而部分脱盲者出现回生复盲现象是难于完全避免的。但是，正因为这个缘故，巩固和提高的工作更显得重要。学如逆水行舟，不进则退。扫除文盲之后，巩固和提高工作跟不上，或者这批人的学习稍有放松，回生复盲的人数还会继续扩大。这种情况应当引起足够的注意。前几年就曾有过这种情形，由于生产忙，学习时断时续，有些人头年识了很多字并没有巩固，到来年不得不从头学起。现在群众学文化的积极性很高，完全有条件可以防止这种回生现象的重演。扫除一批文盲就要力求巩固一批，并且逐步提高。
    扫除文盲工作发展很不平衡，即使在一省一县之内的进度也有先有后，有快有慢。扫盲工作快的地区已经基本扫除或接近扫除青壮年文盲；慢的地区距扫除青壮年文盲的要求还较远。在不同的地区，扫盲工作的部署和要求应当有所区别，前者应当以巩固、提高为主，结合进行扫尾；后者仍然要继续大力进行扫盲，边扫边巩固。如何巩固和提高呢？根据各地的经验，扫除文盲之后，紧跟着要建立业余高小、中学、业余文化技术学校、红专大学等由低到高的教育体系；开展多读、多写、多练运动，使脱盲者继续学习。党委要加强这一工作的领导，并抓紧规划。扫盲和巩固、提高工作要与生产紧密结合起来，做到生产在哪里，学习就在哪里。有些人认为学习和生产不好兼顾，顾此失彼，生产一紧，业余教育就有些松懈。是的，生产任务确实很紧张，但这是不是说就一定会影响业余教育呢？不完全是这样，例如陕西省在全民大炼钢铁的运动中，为了巩固扫盲成果，把各类业余学校搬到山巅、炉旁去，有的把原来的学习组织改为以营、连、排军事组织编班，边劳动边学习。长安县不仅把学校搬上山，图书馆也搬上山去、随时供应学员借阅图书，使工地四万多脱盲青壮年每天利用休息时间集中学习一小时半。这个事例说明，只要党政领导注意业余教育工作，适当调整学习的组织形式，使之适应军事化和生产的需要，业余教育就能照常进行。
    在我国扫除为数众多的文盲是一件了不起的事情。但是，只有进一步把脱盲者的文化程度提到更高的水平，我国劳动人民的文化面貌才会彻底改观，这是一个光荣的、也是艰巨的任务。业余教育工作者应该在各地党委的领导下，毫不懈怠地鼓足干劲、再接再厉，使扫盲工作不断跃进。
