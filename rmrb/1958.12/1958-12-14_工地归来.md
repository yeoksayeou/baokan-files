    Returning from the Construction Site
    Du Junjie, Cadre Transferred from the Ministry of Labor
    We were working intensely on the reservoir construction site when suddenly a thunderous roar echoed through the gloomy sky, followed by a torrential downpour. As soon as the horn sounded from the construction site headquarters, we all left the site and headed back to the village in the pouring rain.

    Halfway there, I suddenly remembered the more than one hundred mud bricks we had made were left out in the open to dry, and I couldn't help but exclaim, "This is terrible, the bricks must be ruined by the rain!"

    "Mud bricks, how can they not be ruined in such heavy rain? If we had known it would rain so hard today, we would have gathered them up before coming to the construction site," said Old Ma, who was walking behind me. Then, he said in surprise, "The two sets of clothes I washed last night are still hanging in the yard. What will I wear to change?"

    The one hundred or so mud bricks were made by several comrades who were sent down for labor training, using our spare time to repair our houses. They had been drying for several days and were almost dry, but they were ruined by the rain while we were away. How could we not feel sorry?

    As we approached the village, we passed the place where the bricks were drying and saw not a single brick. All we saw were streams of rainwater flowing. We had no choice but to hurry home.

    As soon as we entered the yard, Aunt Huang, our landlord, seemed to have been waiting for us for a long time. Before we could even greet her, she said anxiously, "Comrades, you've worked so hard today. Quickly change into dry clothes. Ma's clothes are here with me." She ran over with two sets of clothes folded neatly.

    Old Ma took the clothes, so grateful that he didn't know what to say. Before he could even utter a word of thanks, Uncle Huang's voice came from the main room: "The mud bricks you made, I've already moved them into the main room." Hearing this, we didn't even bother to change our clothes and rushed to the main room to see. Sure enough, more than one hundred mud bricks were stacked neatly in the corner of the room. We were so happy that we almost jumped for joy, and we went to Uncle Huang and said in unison, "Uncle Huang, thank you so much!" Who knew that this would make Uncle Huang a little unhappy: "Look at what you're saying, living in the same house means we're family. There's nothing to thank!"

    工地归来
    劳动部下放干部  杜俊杰
    我们正在水库工地上紧张地干着，忽然一声巨雷响彻阴沉沉的天空，接着倾盆似的大雨下个不停。工地指挥部的号声一响，我们便都离开了工地，冒着大雨回村子。
    走到半路，我忽然想起我们做的一百多块泥砖还放在露天晾着，便情不自禁地叫了起来：“这一下可糟了，砖一定被雨打坏了！”
    “泥做的砖，碰上这样大的雨，怎么能不被打坏呢？早知道今天下这样大的雨的话，我们在来工地以前一定要把它拾掇起来。”走在我后面的老马接着说。接着，他又吃惊的说：“我昨天夜里洗的两套衣服还搭在院子里，回去拿什么换呢？”
    一百多块泥砖是我们下放劳动锻炼的几位同志为了修补房屋利用劳动的余暇做成的。做好以后，已经晒了几天，快要干了，偏偏就在我们不在家的时候被雨打坏，怎能不可惜呢。
    走到村子跟前，经过晒砖的地方一看，竟连一块砖的影子也没有。看到的只是一股一股流淌着的雨水。我们只好匆匆地向家中奔去。
    刚一走进院子，房东黄大娘好像已经等候我们很长的时候，我们还没有来得及和她打招呼，她就着急的说：“同志，你们今天太辛苦了，快快换上干衣服；马同志洗的衣服在我这里放着。”她拿着折叠得很整齐的两套衣服跑过来。
    老马接过衣服，感激得不知如何是好，一句感谢的话还没有说出口来，堂屋里就传出了黄大伯的声音：“你们做的泥砖，我已经搬在堂屋里了。”听黄大伯这一说，我们几个人连干衣服也顾不及换，就连忙跑到堂屋里去看，果然一百多块泥砖方方正正地堆在屋角里。我们几个人高兴得几乎跳了起来，不约而同的走到黄大伯跟前说：“黄大伯，太感谢你了！”谁知这一说倒把黄大伯说得有点不高兴了：“看你们把话说到哪里去了，住在一家就是一家人嘛，还有感谢的啥呢！”
