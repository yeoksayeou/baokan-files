Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 26th: According to TASS, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko said at the Supreme Soviet session on December 25th that the Soviet government is prepared to sign an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests at any time, even tomorrow, without any attached conditions or preconditions, and from that day onwards, together with the United States and Britain, to cease all explosive testing of various nuclear weapons forever.

Gromyko also said that the United States and Britain are now attempting to turn their demands regarding nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes into a means of obstructing the achievement of an agreement. He said that, considering this, the Soviet government is willing to reach an agreement on implementing limited nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. In this case, the Soviet Union's starting point is that the total number of such explosions conducted by the United States and Britain should be equal to the number of explosions conducted by the Soviet Union. The total number of explosions conducted each year should be agreed upon in advance and should be strictly limited.

Gromyko made these remarks in response to inquiries raised by deputies of the Supreme Soviet. The deputies asked the Soviet government to explain: (1) The progress of negotiations on the cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and what is preventing an agreement on this issue? (2) What is the attitude of Western governments towards the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, and what is the current situation regarding the Berlin problem?

In answering the first question, Gromyko pointed out that no substantial progress has been made so far at the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests. This is due to the position taken by the Western delegations. The representatives of the United States and Britain are not in a hurry to solve the tasks facing the conference.

Gromyko said that it should be stated frankly that the governments of the United States and Britain apparently have the intention of preventing the negotiations on the cessation of testing from reaching an agreement.

Gromyko then refuted the deceptive claim by the United States and British governments that "effective supervision is almost impossible." He pointed out that all the demands and conditions put forward by Western countries regarding inspections of various countries' territories run counter to the resolutions of the Geneva Expert Conference. Such absurd demands only prove that the representatives of the US-British bloc are trying to obtain corresponding reconnaissance materials.

Gromyko emphasized that the Western countries have not shown a willingness to negotiate in good faith at another Geneva conference—the conference on preventing the danger of surprise attacks. They apparently do not want to discuss measures to prevent such attacks, but only want to collect materials on the various armaments of various countries.

Gromyko said: "We can only satisfy the curiosity of the Western representatives in one aspect: to declare to them again that the Soviet Union possesses a large number of new weapons of various types, sufficient to ensure the security of the country from any external aggression. However, the Soviet government would rather destroy all these weapons, or only use them for peaceful purposes. The Soviet government is prepared to do so immediately, as long as Western countries agree to sign a treaty with corresponding disarmament measures."

When talking about the West Berlin issue, Gromyko said that if the current situation in West Berlin is not ended, then the danger of West Berlin becoming a second Sarajevo (the site of the outbreak of World War I) is even greater. He said: "Any provocation carried out here, as well as any act of aggression against the German Democratic Republic, may cause a great war that will destroy tens of millions of people. The flames of war will inevitably spread to the American continent, because in modern military technology there is virtually no distinction between near and far battlefields." He said that only those who have lost their minds would not consider all this.

Gromyko said: The Soviet government believes that the most correct way to solve the Berlin problem is for the directly relevant countries to hold reasonable negotiations. If the Soviet Union cannot reach a unanimous agreement with Western countries on the Berlin issue, then the Soviet Union will unconditionally transfer the powers it has exercised in Berlin and on the transport lines between Berlin and West Germany to the German Democratic Republic.

Gromyko emphasized that the statements made by Western leaders and the communiqué issued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council a few days ago on the Berlin issue are a tactic, because these statements and communiqués attempt to entangle the issue of normalizing the situation in Berlin with the issue of German reunification, while also putting forward the outdated so-called "free all-German elections" platform.

Gromyko said that adopting this tactic is to avoid resolving the acute and urgent Berlin problem. The Soviet government has repeatedly emphasized that no one has the right to "unify" Germany from the outside for or in place of the Germans, and the Soviet Union will not be associated with such a plan.

Gromyko emphasized: "The unification of Germany can only be the result of contact and consultation between the two countries, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and in the current situation no mechanical method can solve this problem."

    葛罗米柯在苏联最高苏维埃会议上指出
    苏联愿随时同美英签订停止核试验协定
    有关国家谈判是解决柏林问题正确途径
    新华社26日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯25日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上说，苏联政府准备随时，那怕是就在明天，没有任何附带条件和先决条件来就停止试验核武器问题签订协定，并且从这一天起，同美国、英国一道永远停止各种核武器的爆炸试验。
    葛罗米柯又说，美英两国现在企图把自己关于为和平目的进行核爆炸的要求变成阻挠达成协定的一种手段。他说，考虑到这一点，苏联政府愿意就为和平目的实行有限的核爆炸达成协议。在这种情况下，苏联的出发点是，美英两国进行这种爆炸的次数的总和，同苏联进行爆炸的次数应当相等。每年进行爆炸的总数应当事先商定，并且应当严格限制。
    葛罗米柯是在回答苏联最高苏维埃代表们提出的质询时说这番话的。代表们在会议上请苏联政府说明：（一）关于停止试验原子弹和氢弹的谈判进行的情况以及究竟是什么妨碍就这个问题达成协议？（二）西方国家的政府对苏联关于变西柏林为非军事化的自由城市的建议抱什么态度，目前在柏林问题上形成了怎样的局面？
    葛罗米柯在回答第一个问题时指出，在日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议上至今尚未取得实质上的成就。这是西方国家代表团所采取的立场造成的。美国和英国的代表不急于解决会议所面临的任务。
    葛罗米柯说，应该直率地说，美国和英国政府显然是抱定这样的目的，就是不让关于停止试验问题的谈判达成协议。
    葛罗米柯接着驳斥了美国和英国政府所谓“有效监督几乎是不可能”的欺骗说法，他指出，西方国家提出的关于视察各国领土的一切要求和条件同日内瓦专家会议的决议背道而驰。这种荒谬绝伦的要求只是证明，美英集团的代表们竭力想获得相应的侦察材料。
      葛罗米柯强调指出，西方国家在另一个日内瓦会议——防止突然袭击危险的会议上没有表现出愿意谈判的诚意。它们显然不希望讨论防止这种袭击的措施，而只想收集有关各国各种军备情况的材料。
      葛罗米柯说：“我们只能在一个方面满足西方代表们的好奇心：再次向他们声明，苏联拥有大量各种类型的新武器，足够确保国家的安全不受任何外来的侵犯。但是，苏联政府宁愿销毁所有这些武器，或者只用于和平目的。苏联政府准备马上就这样做，只要西方国家同意签订相应的裁军措施的条约。”
    葛罗米柯在谈到西柏林问题时说：如果不结束西柏林目前的这种状况，那么西柏林可能成为第二个萨拉热窝（第一次世界大战的爆发地点）的危险性就更大了。他说：“在这里所进行的任何挑衅，以及企图对德意志民主共和国进行的任何侵略行为都可能引起毁灭千万人的大战。战火不可避免地要蔓延到美洲大陆，因为在现代军事技术下事实上已没有远近战场之分了。”他说，只有丧失理性的人才会不考虑这一切。
    葛罗米柯说：苏联政府认为，解决柏林问题的最正确的途径就是直接有关的国家举行合理的谈判。苏联如果不能同西方国家在柏林问题上达成一致协议的话，那么苏联将毫无保留地把苏联至今在柏林以及柏林同西德的交通线上行使的职权移交给德意志民主共和国。
    葛罗米柯着重指出，西方国家领导人的声明以及北大西洋公约组织理事会前几天就柏林问题发表的公报是一种手法，因为在这些声明和公报中企图把柏林状况正常化的问题同统一德国的问题纠缠在一起，同时又提出早就过了时的所谓“全德自由选举”的陈旧纲领。
    葛罗米柯说，采取这种手法是不想解决尖锐而迫切的柏林问题。苏联政府已经多次强调指出，谁也没有权利从外部来为德国人或代替德国人“统一”德国，同时苏联不会同这种计划有任何关联。
    葛罗米柯着重说：“统一德国只能是德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国这两个国家接触和协商的结果，在当前情况下任何机械的方式都不能解决这个问题。”
