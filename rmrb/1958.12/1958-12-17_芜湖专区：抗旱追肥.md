According to a report in the *Anhui Daily*, over 260,000 people in Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui Province, are engaging in a vigorous anti-drought and seedling promotion campaign in conjunction with field management. From the beginning of this month to the 12th, over 1,100,000 mu of drought-stricken wheat, barley, and rapeseed have been irrigated once. The irrigated summer crops have rapidly turned from yellow to green, and seeds that had not yet sprouted have quickly germinated and emerged from the soil.

Wuhu Prefecture has experienced over a month without rainfall from mid-November to the present, severely threatening the growth of summer crops. Some of the emerged wheat, barley, and rapeseed seedlings had turned from green to yellow, withered, and become weak, while some of the late-sown wheat seeds were unable to sprout. After this situation arose, Party committees at all levels immediately led the masses in launching a summer crop anti-drought and seedling promotion campaign. Nanling County quickly launched a vigorous anti-drought and seedling promotion campaign throughout the county. All of the more than 180,000 mu of drought-stricken wheat, barley, and rapeseed had been irrigated once by the 10th. Since the beginning of the month, Xuancheng County has had over 17,000 people irrigating in conjunction with field management every day, and 200,000 mu of drought-stricken crops have been irrigated once. To protect the irrigated summer crops from frost damage, all regions in the prefecture generally adopted the method of mixing five or six ladles of manure with each load of water, and two or three taels of fertilizer powder with each load of water.

The anti-drought and seedling promotion campaign carried out in various places was launched after resolving many ideological issues. The most prominent and widespread problem encountered was that many cadres believed that “wheat fears waterlogging but not drought.” When the Nanling County Party Committee discovered this resistant sentiment, it summarized the high-yield experience of "five fertilizers" and "six irrigations" for wheat, explaining that wheat fears both waterlogging and drought. At the same time, it stipulated that each commune captain and above should irrigate a plot of wheat as an experiment. As a result, the irrigated wheat leaves straightened out in one day, quickly turned from yellow to green, and those that had not sprouted quickly germinated and emerged from the soil in two or three days, with a high emergence rate. For example, Qian Zeng, the second secretary of the county party committee, experimented with a plot of land in the Jiafa Commune, irrigating half and leaving the other half unirrigated. The next day, the irrigated wheat leaves straightened and turned green, while the unirrigated leaves remained withered and yellow. The county held an on-site meeting using the cadres' experimental fields as models, thus rapidly launching an irrigation upsurge.

    芜湖专区：抗旱追肥
    据安徽日报消息  安徽芜湖专区每天有二十六万多人结合田间管理投入抗旱旺苗运动。从本月初到12日止，已有一百一十多万亩受旱的大、小麦和油菜受到了一次灌溉，被灌溉的夏熟作物，迅速由黄转青，未出苗的种子也迅速发芽出土。
    芜湖专区各地从11月中旬到现在有一个多月没有降雨，严重的威胁着夏熟作物的生长。已出苗的部分大、小麦和油菜已由青变黄、萎缩瘦弱，一部分迟种的麦子出不来苗。这种情况发生以后，各级党委便领导群众立即掀起了夏熟作物的抗旱旺苗运动。南陵县全县迅速掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗旱旺苗运动。受旱的十八万多亩大、小麦和油菜，到10日止，已全部浇灌一次。宣城县从月初到现在，每天都有一万七千多人结合田间管理进行浇灌，已有二十万亩受旱作物受到一次灌溉。为了使被浇灌的夏熟作物不受冻害，全区各地在浇灌时一般都采用一担水兑五、六瓢粪和每担水掺二、三两肥田粉的办法。
    各地进行的抗旱旺苗运动是在解决了不少思想问题后开展起来的，其中遇到的最突出、最普遍的问题是，不少干部存在着“麦子怕涝不怕旱”。南陵县委在发现这种抵触情绪时，一面总结了小麦“五肥”“六水”的高产经验，说明麦子既怕涝也怕旱，同时又规定各公社队长以上干部每人浇灌一块麦子作试验。结果凡是经过浇灌的麦叶子一天就由卷伸直，迅速由黄转青，未出苗的，两、三天后也很快发芽出土，而且出苗率很高。如县委第二书记钱增在家发公社搞一块试验田，一半浇灌，一半未浇灌。第二天浇过的麦叶子放直返青，未浇的还是萎缩发黄。全县就以干部的试验田为样板召开了现场会议，从而迅速地掀起了浇灌热潮。
