Xinhua News Agency, 10th – The Third National Congress of the China Democratic League has concluded on the 4th.

The congress officially opened on November 28th. During the congress, over 280 representatives fully discussed the work report made by Shen Junru on behalf of the Second Central Committee of the China Democratic League, as well as the issues of the China Democratic League's organizational reform and the individual reform of its members. The representatives unanimously agreed that, in order for the members of the China Democratic League to contribute all their strength to the socialist construction and plunge into the upsurge of the technological revolution and cultural revolution, the members must first fundamentally transform their political stand and transform themselves from bourgeois intellectuals into working-class intellectuals. The China Democratic League organization must also be transformed from a bourgeois political party into a party that truly accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and serves socialism. To this end, the representatives unanimously approved the "Draft Socialist Transformation Plan of the China Democratic League" at the congress on the 4th, as the goal and working principle for all members and the China Democratic League organization. The representatives also passed a proposal at the meeting to launch a socialist self-reform competition with various democratic parties.

During the congress, all the representatives studied Chairman Mao's document on "Imperialism and all Reactionaries are Paper Tigers," and listened to Premier Zhou's report on the struggle situation in the Taiwan Strait area and the anti-imperialist tasks of the Chinese people, as well as Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech to the representatives of various democratic parties. This enabled them to more clearly recognize the paper tiger nature of imperialism, especially American imperialism, and to further understand our country's guidelines and policies in the current class struggle and socialist construction. It also gave them a clearer understanding and greater confidence in following the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, transforming the organization and its members, and changing the bourgeois standpoint. Everyone is determined to struggle to successfully complete the three tasks: actively participating in the struggle against imperialism, defending peace, and liberating Taiwan; actively participating in socialist construction and socialist revolution, especially the technological revolution and cultural revolution; and accelerating the socialist transformation of the China Democratic League's organization and members.

Shi Liang delivered a closing speech on behalf of the presidium of the congress. She said: This congress is a great leap forward congress with very rich content. The representatives all approached this congress with a serious and earnest attitude, and a style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. She hoped that the representatives would always maintain the new spirit of unity and progress shown at this meeting, and bring this spirit to all levels of organizations of the entire league.

Before the closing of the congress, the Second Central Committee's work report and the China Democratic League's Socialist Transformation Plan were unanimously adopted. One hundred and fifty-two people, including Ding Lude, were elected as members of the Third Central Committee, and thirty-seven people, including Ding Shi'e, were elected as alternate members of the Central Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th – The first plenary meeting of the Third Central Committee of the China Democratic League was held on the morning of the 6th, electing the chairman, vice-chairmen, and 35 members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee. The list is as follows:

    充分讨论了组织改造和个人改造问题
    民盟全国代表大会闭幕
    选出沈钧儒为主席杨明轩等九人为副主席
    新华社10日讯  中国民主同盟第三次全国代表大会已经在4日闭幕。
    大会是在11月28日正式开幕的。大会期间，二百八十多名代表对沈钧儒代表民盟第二届中央委员会作的工作报告以及民盟组织的改造和盟员个人的改造问题进行了充分讨论。代表们一致认为，为了使民盟的成员贡献出一切力量为社会主义建设服务，投入技术革命和文化革命的高潮中去，就首先要求成员根本上改造自己的政治立场，把自己从资产阶级知识分子改造成为工人阶级知识分子。民盟组织也必须由资产阶级性质的政党改造成为真正接受共产党领导的、为社会主义服务的党派。为此，代表们在4日的大会上一致通过了“中国民主同盟社会主义改造规划草案”，作为全体盟员和民盟组织的奋斗目标和工作准绳。代表们在会上还通过了一项同各民主党派展开社会主义自我改造竞赛的倡议书。
    大会期间，全体代表学习了毛主席论“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献，先后听了周总理关于台湾海峡地区的斗争形势和我国人民的反帝任务的报告和陈毅副总理对各民主党派代表的讲话，更清楚地认识到帝国主义尤其是美国帝国主义的纸老虎的本质，对于我国在当前阶级斗争和社会主义建设上的方针、政策，有了进一步的理解，对于在中国共产党领导下走社会主义道路，改造组织和成员，改变资产阶级立场，有了更明确的认识和更大的信心。大家决心为胜利完成三项任务而奋斗，那就是：积极参加反对帝国主义、保卫和平和解放台湾的斗争；积极参加社会主义建设和社会主义革命，特别是技术革命和文化革命；加速进行民盟的组织和盟员的社会主义改造。
    史良代表大会主席团致闭幕词。她说：这次大会是一次内容十分丰富的跃进大会。代表们都以严肃认真的态度，敢想敢说敢做的风格来开这个大会。她希望代表们永远保持这次会上表现出来的团结进步的新精神，并把这种精神带到全盟各级组织中去。
    大会闭幕前一致通过了第二届中央委员会的工作报告和民盟社会主义改造规划草案，选出了丁履德等一百五十二人为第三届中央委员会委员，丁是娥等三十七人为候补中央委员。
