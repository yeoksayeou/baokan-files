    Good Sons and Daughters Aspire to All Corners of the Country
    Guarantee to Overcome All Difficulties
    Dear Secretary Comrade:
    I am twenty-two years old this year and a member of the Communist Youth League. For a long time, I have had the desire to work in the frontier areas. After reading Vice Chairman Zhu De's call for young people to go to the frontier to build, I firmly believe that the Party's call embodies the aspirations of thousands of young people. I not only have the desire to go to the frontier to work, but also the determination and confidence to overcome all hardships and difficulties to complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party. I am willing to fight to the end for the construction of the socialist frontier.

    "I Love My Hometown, But I Love Qinghai Even More"
    Dear Secretary Zhang:
    I am a student at a senior nursing school and will graduate after taking the national exam in April next year. As early as in middle school, I learned about Qinghai's terrain, climate, products, etc. from geography class. At that time, I had fantasies: how happy it would be to go to Qinghai! Later, I often read news and reports reflecting the new face of Qinghai in newspapers and magazines, and I became even more yearning for Qinghai. Recently, I read your article in the People's Daily. The beautiful scenery of Qinghai after five years of hard work is so fascinating! After careful consideration, I decided to participate in the construction of Qinghai. Dear Secretary Zhang: I love my hometown, but I love Qinghai even more. I assure you: I will never be a deserter because of hardships in life, cold climate, and other difficulties. I am not coming to Qinghai as a guest, but to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in Qinghai.

    Go Where the Motherland Needs Us
    Dear Leaders of Qinghai Province:
    "Young people, go to the frontier!" This is the solemn call that the motherland has issued to us, and we warmly respond. We respond to the Party's call to go to the places in the motherland that need us most, and dedicate our youth to the construction of the frontier.
    We are a group of high school graduates, healthy, and now studying at home on our own. After the rectification and anti-Rightist struggles, we clearly know that we must go to the places in the motherland that need us most to train and transform ourselves. We assure the leaders: we will definitely listen to the Party, obey assignments, not be afraid of any difficulties, and never care about personal gains or losses. We will use our lifelong energy to build the motherland's lovable frontier.
    Li Guangtong and eight others, Hangzhou City

    Ten Thousand Miles of Letters to Talk About Aspirations
    Responsible Comrades of Qinghai Province:
    I am from Shanghai. Since reading the articles in the People's Daily introducing the construction of Qinghai, I have been extremely excited. Leaders comrades: How much I hope to come to Qinghai to participate in the construction! I want to throw myself into the fiery life struggle to train myself and transform myself, so as to better serve the people under the guidance of the Party and dedicate all my strength to the socialist construction of Qinghai.

    好儿女志在四方
    保证克服一切困难亲爱的书记同志：
    我今年二十二岁，是个共青团员。很久以来，就有到边疆工作的愿望。从人民日报上读了朱德副主席号召青年到边疆去建设的消息后，我深信：党的号召，是体现了千万青年的心愿的。我不但有到边疆去工作的愿望，而且更有克服一切艰苦、一切困难完成党所交给我的任务的决心和信心。我愿意为建设社会主义的边疆而奋斗到底。
    广东省惠东县  季年辉
    “我爱家乡，更爱青海”亲爱的张书记：
    我是高级护士学校的学生，到明年4月参加国家考试后就要毕业啦。早在中学的时候，我从地理课上了解到青海的地形、气候、物产等情况，那时，就曾有过幻想：能到青海去该是多么幸福啊！后来，在报纸和杂志上经常读到反映青海新面貌的新闻和通讯，我更加向往青海了。最近，我在人民日报上读了您写的文章，苦战五年后的青海美景，是多么使人神往！经过三思，我决心要参加青海建设。亲爱的张书记：我爱自己的家乡，但我更热爱青海。我向您保证：我决不因为生活艰苦、气候寒冷等困难就作逃兵，我来青海不是作客，而是要在青海扎下根，开花、结果。
    吉林省盘石县  侯殿荣
    到祖国需要的地方去亲爱的青海省首长：
    “年轻人，到边疆去！”这是祖国向我们发出的庄严号召，我们热烈响应。响应党叫我们到祖国最需要的地方去，把自己的青春献给边疆的建设事业。
    我们是一群高中毕业生，身体健壮，现在都在家自学。我们经过整风和反右派斗争，清楚地知道要到祖国最需要的地方去锻炼和改造自己。我们向首长保证：一定听党的话，服从分配，不怕任何困难，决不计较个人得失，用自己的毕生精力来建设祖国可爱的边疆。
    杭州市李光桐等八人
    万里投书谈心愿青海省负责同志：
    我是上海人，自从看了人民日报介绍青海建设情况的文章后，内心无比激动。首长同志：我是多么希望到青海来参加建设啊！我要投入到火热的生活斗争中锻炼自己改造自己，以便更好地在党的教导下为人民服务，为青海的社会主义建设事业献出我的一切力量。
        上海市淮海中路  秦境丽
