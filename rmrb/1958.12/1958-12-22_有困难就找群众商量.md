When There are Difficulties, Consult with the Masses
Song Xinru, Deputy Director of the West River Township Commune, Raoyang County, Hebei

I was originally a housewife who didn't even know how to read a single word. Since becoming the head of a mutual aid team in 1946, and later the head of an agricultural cooperative, I've done a lot of work over these past dozen years. Whenever I encountered difficulties, I had two methods: one was to listen to the Party, and the other was to consult with the masses. The communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party once again taught us that to do a good job, we must follow the mass line. I think this is truly a good magic weapon.

Separated from the masses, good things can be done badly; relying on the masses, bad things can be turned into good. I have many personal experiences with this.

In 1954, we were busy with production, planning to plant cotton and peanuts. Several cadres discussed it and just started doing it. At first, things grew very well, but we didn't expect these crops to be so susceptible to water, and later a big flood washed everything away. We were full of good intentions to do good things for the masses, but it turned out to be a bad thing, resulting in the masses' complaints. This incident taught me a harsh lesson. The following year, when planting crops, we first convened a meeting of cooperative member representatives for discussion, and then sought the opinions of experienced farmers. Based on the characteristics of our area's low-lying land, we decided to plant sorghum and hemp, and the harvest was indeed very good.

In 1956, we suffered a flood, and there was no harvest at all. More than 700 people in the whole cooperative needed to eat, which worried me a lot. What could I do alone? Let's consult with everyone! We convened Party branch meetings, cadre meetings, and cooperative member representative meetings, and finally found fourteen kinds of sideline occupations. Weaving mats, running transport, and engaging in textiles, turned many useless materials into useful ones, and revived many sideline occupations that had been abandoned for years. Everyone was happy to engage in them, with a monthly income of more than 3,000 yuan, so there was no sign of disaster in a disaster year.

Many things that seem difficult to handle at first become easy once the masses are mobilized. Let me tell you another story: In 1957, we established a large cooperative of more than 800 households. At that time, some cadres proposed buying livestock and building sheds. A preliminary calculation showed that building twenty-six sheds for twenty-six production teams, plus buying livestock, would cost three to four thousand yuan. I felt that this was somewhat divorced from reality. But one of our deputy directors said, "Leading such a big cooperative, we must have a grand style, and the money that should be spent must be spent." We argued back and forth, and neither of us could convince the other. Let's ask the masses. More than forty cooperative member representatives from the whole cooperative discussed it, and everyone said, "We have suffered disasters for years and are a poor cooperative. We must be diligent and thrifty in doing everything, and we can't spend money so recklessly." Where should the livestock be fed? The representatives said that we could borrow civilian houses first. After a discussion on the spot, it was found that each team could find a house, and the problem was solved smoothly.

I have mobilized the masses to do many things in this way. Of course, when consulting with the masses and listening to their opinions, we must not commit tailism. We should also distinguish right from wrong among the opinions of the masses and have a bottom line in our own minds. Therefore, what is more important is to have the leadership of the Party.

    有困难就找群众商量
    河北饶阳县西河乡公社副社长  宋欣茹
    我原是一个家庭妇女，过去连一个大字也不识。自从1946年当上互助组长，以后又当农业社长，这十几年，作的工作可真不少。每遇到困难，我的办法有两条：一条是听党的话，一条是找群众商量。党的八届六中全会公报再一次教导我们说，办好工作，必须走群众路线。我觉得这实在是一件好法宝。
    脱离了群众，好事也可能办坏；依靠了群众，坏事也能变好。这样的事，我有许多亲身的体验。
    1954年闹生产，我们计划种棉花和花生，几个干部一商量就干起来了。起初长的也很好，可是没想到这东西最怕水，后来一场大水给冲光了。满心想给群众办好事，结果却成了坏事，落得群众埋怨。这件事狠狠地教训了我。第二年种庄稼，就先召集社员代表会讨论，又征求老农的意见，根据我们那里洼地的特性，决定种高粱和大麻，收成果然很好。
    1956年我们那里闹水灾，颗粒未收，全社七百多人要吃饭，这可把我愁坏了。我一个人有什么办法呢？还是找大家来商量吧！我们召开了党的支部会、干部会、社员代表会，终于找到十四种副业。编席、跑运输、搞纺织，很多材料无用变有用，多年丢掉的副业也捡起来了。大家搞的欢，每月有三千多元的收入，家家有了吃喝，灾年不见灾。
    有许多初看起来是很难办的事情，只要发动了群众，就变难为易。这里再说一件事：1957年，我们办起了八百多户的大社。当时有的干部提出来要买牲口、搭棚圈。初步一合计，二十六个生产队搭二十六所棚圈，再加买牲口，就得三、四千元。我觉得这么办有点脱离实际。可是我们有一个副主任却说：“领导这么大个社，得大大方方的有个派头，该花的钱就要花。”我们两个争来争去，谁也说服不了谁。还是问问群众吧。全社四十多个社员代表来了一商量，大伙说：“我们连年遭灾，是个穷社，办什么事更要勤俭节约，可不能这么乱花钱。”牲口喂在什么地方呢？代表们说，可以先借用民房。当场一研究，各队都可以找到房子，问题就这样顺利地解决了。
    很多事情，我都是这样发动群众来作的。当然，和群众商量，倾听群众的意见，也不能犯尾巴主义，对群众中的意见也应辨别是非，自己心里要有个底。所以更重要的，还是要有党的领导。
