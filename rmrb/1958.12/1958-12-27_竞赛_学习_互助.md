    Competition, Learning, Mutual Assistance
    Gong Jing, Secretary of the Party Committee of Guxian Steel Plant, CCP
                      Yin Zhengnan, Deputy Secretary
    Our Guxian Steel Plant was established in 1947. At that time, on the eve of the counter-offensive in the War of Liberation, the Military Industry Department of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region concentrated the personnel and equipment of some small military factories in the Taihang Mountains to build this factory in order to meet the needs of ammunition production. Since its establishment, we have inherited the fine traditions of hard struggle of the "Old Eighth Route Army," and have gradually developed from small to large into the current small iron and steel complex.
    Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call for the whole party and the whole people to make steel, Guxian Steel and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have been competing in steel production and launched a socialist competition. Our factory has surpassed Taiyuan Iron and Steel in absolute output three times, and the highest daily output of steel has reached 2,150 tons, which is 20 times higher than the original output. Taiyuan Iron and Steel also quickly caught up and surpassed us again. Through competition, we have achieved the goal of mutual learning, mutual promotion, and common improvement. Both factories overfulfilled the steel production plan from September to November.
    Guxian Steel is a small factory, and it is not as good as Taiyuan Iron and Steel in terms of production scale, equipment, and technical strength. In the process of our factory's growth, Taiyuan Iron and Steel has given us selfless assistance. During the Great Leap Forward this year, when the country urgently needed steel but our rolling mill equipment could not exert its potential due to the lack of parts, Taiyuan Iron and Steel supported us with their rolling mill spare parts, so that our factory's steel output could be increased. Currently, transportation capacity is tight, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel has supported our factory with their two locomotives. The communist spirit of cooperation of Taiyuan Iron and Steel has given us great encouragement.
    Why does our small factory dare to compete with Taiyuan Iron and Steel? This is because all the employees of Guxian Steel inherit the fine tradition of the "Old Eighth Route Army" of the Huangyandong Ordnance Repair Shop during the Anti-Japanese War, who were not afraid of hardship and difficulty. We admit that Taiyuan Iron and Steel is advanced and is a model for us to learn from. But we believe that as long as we rely closely on the masses and give play to people's subjective initiative, we will catch up with or surpass Taiyuan Iron and Steel in terms of output.
    Our competition with Taiyuan Iron and Steel has truly achieved the goal of mutual promotion and mutual improvement. For example, on September 29th and 30th, our factory produced two days of 1,000 tons of steel. When we heard that Taiyuan Iron and Steel was going to send people to visit our factory, we summed up our experience and carefully introduced it to the representatives of Taiyuan Iron and Steel. When Taiyuan Iron and Steel's steel output reached 1,839 tons on October 11th, surpassing us, the employees of our factory were very happy. We also used this as a vivid teaching material to launch a discussion among the employees, which aroused the enthusiasm of the masses.
    On October 14th, we achieved another brilliant victory of producing 2,150 tons of steel per day. After Taiyuan Iron and Steel reached a daily output of more than 8,300 tons of steel on October 24th, we again used this as a vivid teaching material to put forward a new task of catching up with Taiyuan Iron and Steel to the employees.
    Later, we started a new battle with Taiyuan Iron and Steel around rolling steel. In the three days from November 28th to 30th, our factory's rolling mill workshop rolled 232 steel pieces per hour, exceeding Taiyuan Iron and Steel. On December 2nd, the Class B of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Rolling Mill Workshop rolled 280 steel pieces per hour, surpassing us again. This promoted the friendly competition between the two factories to a climax wave after wave.
    In this competition, we have the following experiences:
    First, socialist competition is the most practical communist education. The whole process of competition is essentially a process of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and common improvement. Through this activity, we can encourage the revolutionary heroism and enterprising spirit of the majority of employees, and enhance their sense of responsibility for the socialist cause. Through this competition, all the employees of the factory have established the communist ideology of cherishing the collective and caring for the collective. The workers' enthusiasm for labor has been high, and a large number of activists have emerged, among whom 67 people have honorably joined the Party.
    Second, in this great steel battle, all the cadres participated in labor, the office was moved to the construction site, and the cadres and workers ate, lived, and worked together. Once a problem was discovered, they studied it together with the workers and solved it on the spot. The workers and cadres were closely united. In terms of management system, because the leaders went deep into the construction site and consulted with the masses on everything, some unreasonable rules and regulations were broken, and many tasks were handled quickly and promptly.
    Third, through this competition, we broke the view that small factories cannot compete with large factories. Practice has proved that small factories cannot compete with large factories in terms of absolute output due to the limitations of equipment conditions, but the unit output of the same equipment can compete with large factories. Through competition, we also realized that the important significance of competition lies in mutual promotion and common improvement, and in establishing a communist style.
    Fourth, the competition process is also a process of continuous innovation and improvement of production technology. In order to increase production, we have carried out technological reforms in accordance with the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. We have successfully created a complete set of three-level equipment for iron smelting, steelmaking, and ingot casting with small converters, which allows molten iron and molten steel to flow automatically, which is a major revolution in steelmaking technology. We have also transformed the scattered small indigenous furnace groups into centralized small foreign furnace groups, and are preparing to gradually transition to medium-sized foreign furnace groups. We have now implemented fixed points, fixed personnel, fixed output, and fixed leadership, so that the "small indigenous groups" can embark on factoryization, and production can be rapidly improved.
    In the future, we must further expand competition with Taiyuan Iron and Steel. Through competition, we will strive to improve ourselves and make a greater leap forward next year. (Attached picture)

    竞赛·学习·互助
    中共故县钢铁厂党委会书记  弓  靖
                      副书记  尹正南
    我们故县钢铁厂是在1947年建立的。当时正值解放战争大反攻的前夕，晋冀鲁豫边区军工部为了满足军火生产的需要，在太行山区集中了抗日根据地的一些小型军工厂的人员和设备，建了这座工厂。建厂以来，我们继承了“老八路”的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，由小到大，逐步发展成为现在的小型钢铁联合企业。
    自从党中央提出全党全民炼钢的号召以后，我们故钢和太原钢铁公司在钢铁生产上大比干劲，开展了社会主义竞赛。我厂曾三次在绝对产量上超过太钢，钢的日产量最高曾达二千一百五十吨，比原来产量提高二十倍。太钢也急起直追，又赛过了我们。通过竞赛，使我们达到了相互学习、相互促进、共同提高的目的。两个厂9至11月份都超额完成了钢产计划。
    故钢是小厂，在生产规模、设备和技术力量方面都比不上太钢。在我厂成长的过程中，太钢给了我们无私的援助。今年大跃进中，当国家急需钢材而我们的轧钢设备因缺少机件不能发挥潜力的时候，太钢就用他们轧钢的备件支援我们，使我厂的钢材产量能够提高。当前运输力量紧张，太钢又将他们的两个火车头支援了我厂。太钢这种共产主义协作精神给了我们很大鼓舞。
    为什么我们这个小厂敢和太钢竞赛呢？这是因为我们故钢全体职工继承着抗日战争时期黄岩洞修械所“老八路”那种不怕艰苦困难的优良传统。我们承认太钢先进，是我们学习的榜样。但我们相信，只要我们紧紧依靠群众，发挥人的主观能动性，也会在产量等方面赶上或超过太钢。
    我们和太钢的竞赛，真正达到了相互促进、相互提高的目的。如9月29、30日，我厂出现了两个钢产千吨日，听说太钢要派人来厂参观，我们就总结经验，认真地向太钢的代表们作了介绍。当10月11日太钢钢产量达到一千八百三十九吨压倒我们的时候，我厂职工都很高兴。我们还以此为活教材，在职工中展开讨论，激发起群众的干劲。
    10月14日，我们又获得日产钢二千一百五十吨的辉煌战果。10月24日太钢达到日产八千三百多吨钢以后，我们又以此做活教材向职工提出赶太钢的新任务。
    后来，我们又围绕轧钢材开始了和太钢新的对战。在11月28到30日三天内，我厂轧钢车间每小时轧材二百三十二根，超过了太钢。12月2日太钢轧钢车间乙班一小时轧钢材二百八十根，又压倒了我们。这就促使两厂的友谊竞赛一浪接着一浪地推向高峰。
    在这次竞赛中，我们有如下体会：
    一、社会主义竞赛是一种最实际的共产主义教育。整个竞赛的过程，实质上是相互学习、相互帮助、取长补短、共同提高的过程。通过这种活动，可以鼓舞广大职工的革命英雄主义和进取精神，提高对社会主义事业的责任感。通过这场竞赛，全厂职工树立了爱护集体、关心集体的共产主义思想。工人们劳动热情高涨，涌现出大批积极分子，其中有六十七人光荣地入了党。
    二、在这次钢铁大战中，全体干部都参加了劳动，办公室搬到了工地，干部和工人同餐同宿同劳动，一发现问题，就和工人共同研究，就地解决，工人和干部之间亲密团结。在管理制度方面，由于领导深入工地，有事同群众商量，打破了一些不合理的陈规旧律，许多工作都处理得迅速及时。
    三、通过这次竞赛，使我们打破了小厂不能和大厂竞赛的观点。实践证明，小厂由于设备条件的限制在绝对产量上不能和大厂竞赛，但同样设备的单位产量可以和大厂竞赛。通过竞赛，我们还认识到，竞赛的重要意义在于相互促进、共同提高，树立起共产主义风格。
    四、竞赛过程也是生产技术不断革新和提高的过程。为了提高产量，我们本着土洋结合的方针，进行了技术改革。我们已经创造成功小转炉化铁、炼钢、注锭三级设备成套炼钢法，让铁水、钢水自动流，这是炼钢技术上的一大革命。我们还把分散的小土炉群变成集中的小洋炉群，准备再逐步过渡到中洋炉群。我们现在已经实行定点、定员、定产、定领导，使“小土群”走上工厂化，使生产得以迅速提高。
    今后，我们一定要和太钢进一步展开竞赛，通过竞赛，努力提高自己，在明年来一个更大的跃进。（附图片）
