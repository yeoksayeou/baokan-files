Advance, Jianggang!
By our reporters Ji Xichen and Sun Yuedong

Beneath Sword Gate Mountain, who is clothing the green hills in fiery red garments? On the banks of the Fu River, who is scattering ten thousand golden stars into the emerald waters? Who, cloaked in clouds and mist, is setting off thunderous explosions on the hills along the road where the Wei general Deng Ai once marched into Sichuan? Who is kindling an eternal flame before the study of the poet Li Bai? …

When you travel by train, cross the Qinling and Ba Mountains, and enter the Sichuan Basin, seeing the forest of blast furnaces and the fire-lit sky, you will surely want to know, what place is this? The local people will proudly tell you: These are the over two hundred thousand steel warriors fighting in Jiangyou, constructing Jianggang.

Within a cloud-like gray curtain, the Jiangyou-Zhangming Iron and Steel Base, like many giants, stretches its arms along the continuous mountains for over two hundred kilometers: Resting its head on the Tiger Tooth Mountain of Pingwu in the west, leaning against the precipitous Luoyun Mountain in the north, and relying on the cloud-swallowing Guanyun and Taihua Mountains in the south; then, through railways and highways, it tightly embraces the famous Yanmen Dam, Zhongba, Houba, and Wudu Dam into its bosom. In a few years, it will become a vast iron and steel complex.

Crowds from Suining, Santai, Zhongjiang, and other counties are turning this area's high mountains, canyons, and plains into a battlefield for advancing on nature. Although they come from all directions, and before the future, none of them knew what ironmaking or steelmaking was, or could recognize what a blast furnace or ore was, they all have a pair of omnipotent hands and a common, lofty ideal; and that ideal—is wisdom, is strength.

On the road to the Wudu construction site, as we were squeezed forward in the crowded flow of people, the Secretary of the Mianyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China spoke to me about his feelings. He said that although he had experienced many wars and social movements, he had rarely felt as excited and tense as he did during this campaign of the whole people running iron and steel. In the past, who could have imagined that at a single call, three or four hundred thousand peasants could be mobilized to the mountains at once? "Assemble at Jianggang!" Tens of thousands of commune cadres, upon hearing the call, even without waiting to gather in their townships or counties, carried their bedding, tools, and dry rations themselves from hundreds of miles away to find Jianggang. This shows how much the people of our country long for and desire national industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and agricultural factoryization!

Lofty thoughts make people more noble and stronger. What deeply enlightened us to understand this was on Guanyun Mountain, at an altitude of over two thousand four hundred meters. At this time, the setting sun had already disappeared behind the lush mountains, the murmuring water faintly glimmered, and the night mist danced over people's heads. In the dim mountain slopes, in the crushed ore yard, the sound of hammering ore echoed in bursts. The crushed ore, like a small river, flowed down the hillside along the chute. At first, we thought there must be some highly efficient machine here, but upon closer inspection, we realized it was a group of girls wielding iron hammers. An old mother named Ma Changying, nearly fifty years old, sat in the center of the girls. She was the oldest one here, and others had advised her not to go up the mountain; but on the night her son was sent to the steel plant, she also came to the mountain.

"Hammering like this is so slow!"

"As soon as I said this, she looked at me with loving eyes, then rebuked me, as if scolding:

"Comrade, do you think it's slow? It's not slow! With every hammer blow, we are hammering out industrialization!"

Because they infuse their ordinary labor with glorious ideals, they are fearless, and even in the most difficult times, both day and night, those around them can hear them singing:

Raise both hands,
The mountain trembles!
Until stone turns to iron,
We will not leave the hillside!

Not far from here, in front of the steep slope to the left, the engineering company of the mining team built a row of new houses. They baked their own tiles to build houses, used tree branches for beds, green leaves for walls, sleeping on wooden trellises, with the factory right below. But don't underestimate this place; it is the mountaintop construction site, the heart of the technical revolution. Communist Party member Yang Chaowei and his comrades have designed and manufactured a complete set of tools suitable for mountain transportation for the mining area. Nimble earthen trains, winding wooden tracks, towering aerial cables, and long chutes, an intricately crisscrossing transportation network, have increased the efficiency of mining and transporting ore more than tenfold. The workers praise their creations with the saying, "The mountain is high, but our enthusiasm is higher, transporting ore is as light as floating."

Leaving the construction site headquarters, we stood in front of the Baiyi Nunnery, looking around. We saw a sea of lights and fires both up and down the mountain. The moon, rising high in the sky, cast its silvery-white light onto the valley, and also onto the bodies of the steel warriors. Although it was cold, Xie Qingxiang, the No. 3 furnace foreman, had taken off his shirt, exposing his chest, and sweating profusely, he focused all his attention on the tapping hole; sometimes scrutinizing the furnace cavity, sometimes observing the slag, his red eyes reflecting the leaping flames. His skillful movements were entirely like those of an experienced ironmaker, but in reality, just two months ago, he was still herding cattle in the fields as a production team leader. Now, not only has he learned the technology of ironmaking, but also, through painstaking research, he has explored and created a new method of modifying tuyeres, enabling continuous firing for eight or nine furnaces without stopping. When asked what his greatest gain in ironmaking was, he wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand and said with emotion:

"Now I know that ironmaking is really not simple!"

He said that he was extremely happy when he first heard the news of going up the mountain to make iron, but when he arrived at the construction site, he was truly disheartened: there were neither blast furnaces nor electric lights or factories here, and the valley was desolate. At that time, he secretly thought: Wouldn't it be better for me to farm at home?! Perhaps the Party branch secretary saw through his thoughts and called him to the banks of the Fu River one evening, pointing to the Wudu plain surrounded by mountains in front of him, and said to him:

"This is where Nezha stirred up the sea in the Investiture of the Gods. Golden Light Cave, Chentang Pass, and Nezha Temple are on the Fire Basin Mountain not far from Zhongba. … Tens of thousands of years ago, a vast ocean, through the labor of generations of people, is now full of fields and villages. Now, we will use our own hands to build reservoirs, blast furnaces, and factories in this area for our descendants. …"

The future life brought Xie Qingxiang and his comrades infinite strength. Braving wind and rain, treading through mud, they built blast furnaces and straw houses, taking the furnace as their home, guarding it day and night, even eating and drinking while learning to walk and pull the bellows… The furnace was built and demolished, demolished and rebuilt, and after many failures, the first molten iron finally flowed out at dawn one day. People cheered, applauded, and sang, and the entire construction site turned into a sea of joy. At this moment, the Party Secretary of the construction site planted a bright red flag on the furnace called "Pioneer," and congratulated everyone loudly, saying:

"With the first furnace of iron, we can have more steel; in the future, straw fences can become buildings, and small blast furnaces can become steel plants. We must build our own Jianggang!"

    前进吧，江钢
    本报记者  纪希晨  孙跃冬
    剑门山下，是谁，给青山穿上了火红的衣裳？涪江岸上，是谁，在碧绿的江水里，撒下万点金星？是谁，披云裹雾，在昔日魏将邓艾进川的路上，隆隆的爆炸着山岗？是谁，在诗人李白的读书台前，燃烧起不灭的火光？……
    当你乘着列车，跨过秦岭、巴山，进入四川盆地的时候，看见高炉如林、火海映天的景象，一定想知道，这是什么地方？当地的人准会骄傲地告诉你：这是战斗在江油的二十多万钢铁战士，正在建设着江钢。
    在云雾般的灰色帷幔里，江（油）彰（明）钢铁基地，像许多个巨人，沿着连绵的群山，在二百多公里的地区里，舒展着自己的臂膀：西枕平武的虎牙山，北倚险峻的罗云山，南靠吞云吐雾的观雾山、太华山；然后，通过铁路、公路、把著名的雁门坝、中坝、后坝和武都坝，紧紧地搂在自己的胸膛。几年之后，它将变成一个巨大的钢铁联合厂。
    来自遂宁、三台、中江等县的人群，把这一带的高山、峡谷、平坝，变成向大自然进军的战场。他们虽然来自四面八方，在未来之前，谁也不知什么叫炼铁、炼钢，认不得什么是高炉、矿石，可是，他们都有一双万能的手，有共同的崇高的理想；而理想——就是智慧、就是力量。
    在通往武都工地的路上，当我们挟在拥挤的人流中前进时，中共绵阳地委书记，曾这样向我谈起他的感想。他说，他虽经历过多次的战争和社会运动，可是，很少有像这次全民办钢铁这样的激动和紧张。在过去，谁能设想，一声号召，三四十万农民，一下就能动员到山上？“到江钢集合！”成千成万的社员干部听到号召，甚至来不及在乡上县上集中，就自己背着铺盖、工具、干粮，从几百里外，寻找到了江钢。这说明：我国人民对于国家工业化，农业机械化、农业工厂化，是多么想念，多么渴望！
    崇高的思想，把人变得更加高尚和坚强。启示我们深切了解这点的，是在海拔两千四百多公尺的观雾山上。这时，夕阳已经淹没到葱茏的山后了，潺潺的水流，隐约地闪着微光，夜雾飞舞在人们的头顶上。阴暗的山坡里，碎矿场上，一阵阵传来捶击矿石的声响。被打碎的矿石，像一条小河，顺着溜槽，滚滚流下山坡。起先我们还以为，这儿一定有什么效率很高的机器，可是，近前一看，才知道是一群挥着铁锤的姑娘。一位年近五十岁的老妈妈马长英，坐在姑娘们的中央。她是这里年纪最大的一个，别人劝她不要上山；可是，在送儿子进钢厂的那天夜里，她也来到了山上。
    “这样捶，多慢呵！”
    “听我这么一说，她用慈爱的目光望了望我，然后责备似地说：
    “同志，你嫌慢吗？不慢啊！一捶，一捶，我们要捶出工业化哩！”
    由于她们在自己平凡的劳动中贯穿着光辉的理想，所以，她们才无所畏惧，即使在最困难的时候，无论白天和晚上，周围的人群，也都能听到她们的歌唱：
    举起双手，
    矿山发抖！
    不见石变铁，
    决不下山坡！
    离这儿不远，在左边陡峭的山坡前，采矿团工兵连修起了一排新房。他们自己烧瓦盖房，用树枝作床，绿叶作墙，木栅上睡人，木栅下就是工厂。可是，你可不要小看这个地方，它是山顶工地，是技术革命的心脏。共产党员杨朝维和他的战友们，在这里为矿区设计制造了一整套适合于山地运输的工具。灵巧的土火车，盘山的木轨道，高大的溜索，长长的溜槽错综交叉的交通网，把采矿运矿效率提高了十多倍。工人们用“山高没有干劲高，运起矿石轻飘飘”，赞美着自己的创造。
    走出工地指挥部，我们站在白衣庵前，四处张望。只见山下山上，一片灯光、火光。升到高空的月亮，把它那银白的光辉撒向山谷，也撒向钢铁战士的身上，天虽然冷了，可是，三号炉长谢庆祥还脱去了衬衣，露着胸膛，挥着汗雨，全神贯注地俯视在出铁口上；时而?着炉腔，时而?着铁渣，通红的眼睛里映跳着火光。纯熟的动作，完全像个炼铁的老手，但是，实际上，两个月前，他还?着牛，在田野上当生产队长。现在，他不但学会了炼铁的技术，而且，靠着苦心钻研，摸索创造了改装风嘴的新方法，能连续烧八九炉不停火。问到他炼铁中的最大收获是什么？他用手背擦了擦汗，颇有感慨地说：
    “现在我才知道，炼铁可真不简单哩！”
    他说，他最初听到上山炼铁的消息，高兴极了，那知来到工地一看，真叫人心凉：这儿既没有高炉，也没有电灯和工厂，山谷里一片荒凉。当时，他暗暗的忖想：这那有我在家种地强？！许是党支书看透了他的心事，一天傍晚，把他叫到涪江边上，指着眼前群山环抱的武都平坝，对他说：
  “这儿就是封神演义上哪叱闹海的地方。金光洞、陈塘关、哪叱庙就在距中坝不远的火盆山上。……几万年前，一片汪洋的地方，靠着人民祖祖辈辈的劳动，如今，到处都是田野和村庄。现在，我们就要用自己的手，给子孙们在这一带修起水库、高炉和工厂。……
    未来的生活，给谢庆祥和他的战友带来无限的力量。冒着风雨，踏着泥浆，他们建起高炉，修起草房，以炉为家，日日夜夜守护在炉旁，连吃饭喝水，也在学走步子拉风箱……炉子修了又拆，拆了又修，反复经过多少次失败，第一炉通红的铁水，终于，在一天黎明时候奔流出来了。人们欢呼、鼓掌、歌唱，整个工地变成了欢腾的海洋。就在这时候，工地党委书记把一面鲜红的大旗，插在被称为“先锋号”的炉子上，高声地向大家祝贺说：
    “有了第一炉铁，我们就能有更多的钢；将来草栅就能变楼房，小高炉就能变成钢铁厂。我们一定要建设起自己的江钢！”（附图片）
        完成“一○七○”的一员大将——上钢
    上海炼钢工人为“一○七○”贡献了巨大的力量。上海全市的钢产量仅次于辽宁，居全国第二位。这是上海第三钢铁厂工人在炉旁奋战的场面。
