Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: TASS, Moscow, December 28th: TASS commentator Kharkov writes: Japanese newspapers have published numerous articles about the engagement of Japanese Crown Prince Akihito to Miss Michiko Shoda, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Among these countless news items, a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Washington occupies only a small space. However, this news concerns a major issue in U.S.-Japan relations. The reporter wrote that discussions on the so-called U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" are to continue in Tokyo soon. He also hinted that the U.S. Embassy is "extremely interested" in this matter.

Let us recall that the "Security Treaty" mentioned above was signed in 1951 and is an unequal treaty for Japan. It effectively fixed Japan's subordinate status to the United States. This is why the Japanese people are firmly demanding the abolition of this treaty.

Under public pressure, the Japanese ruling group was forced to request negotiations with the United States on amending the "Security Treaty." To this end, nearly two months ago, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and U.S. Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II began talks. Although the outcome of the talks is being kept secret from the public, news reflecting the true nature of these talks has appeared more than once in Japanese and foreign newspapers. The truth is that a new treaty is being prepared under the guise of amending the "Security Treaty." This treaty will not only fail to weaken Japan's subordinate relationship with the United States but will also impose new and serious obligations on Japan. The tentative name of the new treaty is the "Mutual Assistance Treaty," which goes far beyond the "Security Treaty." It covers not only the Japanese islands themselves but also a large part of the Western Pacific region. Such obligations can only pose a great threat to Japan and will only involve Japan in possible military conflicts in this region. Furthermore, this region is already included in the U.S.-Chiang Treaty, the U.S.-Rhee (Syngman) Treaty, and the U.S.-Philippines Treaty. The foundation for the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" military bloc is now being prepared, and U.S. diplomacy is busy establishing this military bloc.

It is no wonder that the Japanese people are treating the talks between Aiichiro Fujiyama and Douglas MacArthur II with great anger. Recently, the issue of amending the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and amending the "Police Duties Execution Law" has become the central issue in Japanese political life. The people's resolute struggle shattered the ruling party's plot to pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" in the Diet. The recent extraordinary session of the Diet (which was actually convened only for the above-mentioned purpose) was held under conditions of a very acute political crisis. The people's struggle forced the ruling party to remove the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" from the agenda of the extraordinary session of the Diet. The struggle surrounding this bill deepened the divisions within the ruling party.

In this situation, the leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party decided to adopt a roundabout tactic. Reportedly, this was not without the instigation of the United States. It has been officially announced that the government will submit a proposal to amend the "Security Treaty" at the ordinary session of the Diet to be convened on December 10th. The ruling party understands that if they act tough as they did with the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment," they will inevitably suffer another and more serious defeat. No wonder the Kishi Nobusuke group is spreading the claim that negotiations with the United States are only aimed at abolishing some of the excessively unequal clauses in the "Security Treaty" for Japan; as for expanding the scope of the treaty to the Western Pacific region and establishing the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" military bloc, it is said that these issues will not be raised for the time being.

The influential "Mainichi Shimbun" slightly lifted the veil, pointing out what kind of goods are hidden behind this statement. This newspaper wrote that the government intends to use this method to draw the Socialist Party, or even a part of the Socialist Party, to its side. In other words, this is an attempt to weaken the opposition of the opposition parties in the Diet, and to ease the divisions within the ruling party, in order to prevent setbacks in the next Diet session when discussing the amendment of the "Security Treaty," which is the cornerstone of the current Japanese cabinet's policy.

On the eve of the ordinary session of the Diet, the Japanese public is demanding that the leaders of the ruling party make a clear answer on the policies they will truly pursue. For most Japanese people, the issue is very clear: the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" should be abolished, and this treaty should not be replaced by a treaty that deepens the enslavement of Japan. If anyone in Japan expects to use the sweet talk of "amending" the treaty to numb the people's vigilance, then this expectation is bound to fail.

### 塔斯社评论员著文指出  日美“安全条约”只能废除不能修改  岸信介甜言蜜语麻痹不了日本人民

    塔斯社评论员著文指出
    日美“安全条约”只能废除不能修改
    岸信介甜言蜜语麻痹不了日本人民
    新华社30日讯  塔斯社莫斯科28日讯：塔斯社评论员哈尔科夫写道：日本报纸大量刊登日本皇太子明仁和一位富翁的女儿正田美智子订婚的消息，在多如雪片的这些消息中，美联社驻华盛顿记者的一则新闻只占了一个不算大的地位。然而这条新闻却谈到了美国和日本关系中的一个主要问题。记者写道，最近要在东京继续讨论所谓美日“安全条约”问题。同时他暗示，美国使馆对这件事“极感兴趣”。
    提醒大家一下，上面谈到的“安全条约”是在1951年签订的，它对日本来说是不平等条约。它实际上把日本对美国的从属地位固定了下来。这就是日本人民坚决要求废除这个条约的原因。
    在公众的压力下，日本统治集团被迫请求美国进行有关修改“安全条约”的谈判。为此，还在将近两个月以前，日本外务相藤山爱一郎和美国大使麦克阿瑟第二就开始会谈了。虽然会谈的结果对公众是保守秘密的，然而在日本和外国的报刊上，不止一次地出现过反映这种会谈的真正性质的消息。事情原来却是这样，在修改“安全条约”的幌子下准备了一项新的条约，这个条约非但不能减弱日本对美国的从属关系，而且使日本承担起新的含有严重后果的义务。新条约暂定的名称是“互助条约”，它远远超过了“安全条约”，它不仅涉及了日本本国的岛屿，而且还包括了西太平洋的大部分地区。这种义务只能使日本遭到很大的威胁，只会把日本卷入在这个地区的可能发生的军事冲突中。此外，这个地区已经包括在美蒋条约、美李（承晚）条约、美菲（律宾）条约的范围内，现在正在给“东北亚条约组织”军事集团准备基础，美国外交正忙于建立这个军事集团。
    难怪日本人民以极大的愤怒来对待藤山爱一郎和麦克阿瑟第二的会谈。近来，修改日美“安全条约”和修改“警察官职务执行法”的问题成了日本政治生活的中心问题。人民的坚决斗争，粉碎了执政党企图在国会通过“警职法修正案”的阴谋。前不久的国会临时会议（实际上只是为了上述目的而召开的）是在政治危机非常尖锐的情况下举行的。人民的斗争迫使执政党从国会临时会议的议程上取消了“警职法修正案”。围绕着这项法案的斗争，加深了执政党内部的分歧。
    在这种情况下，执政党自由民主党的领导决定采取迂回手法。据说，这并不是没有美国的支使的。官方已经正式宣布，政府转向12月10日召开的国会平时会议提出关于修改“安全条约”的提案。执政党明白，如果像处理“警职法修正案”一样地硬干，那一定会遭到再一次更严重的失败。无怪乎岸信介集团散布这样的一种说法，好像同美国的谈判只是为了取消“安全条约”中某些对日本过份不平等的条款；至于说到把条约适用范围扩大到西太平洋地区和建立“东北亚条约组织”军事集团，那么，据说这些问题暂时是不会提出的。
    有影响的“每日新闻”略微揭开了布幕，指明在这种说法的背后隐藏着什么样的货色。这家报纸写道，政府打算用这种方法，把社会党或者那怕是社会党的一部分人拉到自己方面来。换句话说，这是企图削弱国会中的反对派的反对，企图缓和执政党内部的分歧，以便防止在下届国会会议讨论作为日本现任内阁政策基石的修改“安全条约”的问题时受到挫折。
    在国会平时会议前夕，日本公众要求执政党领导人就他们将要真正奉行的政策作出明确的回答，对大多数日本人民来说，问题是十分清楚的，应当废除日美“安全条约”，并且不能用加深奴役日本的条约来替换这个条约。如果在日本有人指望用“修改”条约的甜言蜜语来麻痹人民的警惕性，那么这种指望是要落空的。
