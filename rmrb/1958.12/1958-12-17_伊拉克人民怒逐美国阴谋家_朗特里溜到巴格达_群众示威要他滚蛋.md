Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Baghdad: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree arrived here on the afternoon of the 15th amidst angry protests from the people of Baghdad shouting "Rountree, go home!"

As soon as he got off the plane, airport staff shouted angrily at him, "Conspirator, go home!" At this time, several thousand people outside the airport shouted slogans such as "Scoundrel Rountree, go home!" while waving banners and placards with slogans like "Our republic has no room for warmongers," "We want survival and peace, not death and war." Many angry demonstrators even rushed into the airport.

To avoid the angry demonstrators, Rountree sneaked out of the back door of the airport, but as his car passed by, people continued to curse him and throw stones at his car. All along the route from the airport to the American embassy, banners demanding that Rountree get out were hung. Many newspapers that day used banner headlines saying "Rountree, get out!" Many walls, cars, shop windows, and hotel entrances in the city were plastered with slogans expressing the same sentiment.

When Xinhua News Agency reporters left the airport, they were warmly welcomed by the masses demanding that Rountree get out, who shouted slogans such as "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Iraqi-Chinese friendship!" The reporters' car took ten minutes to travel only forty meters. They were escorted by the crowds one hundred meters from the airport.

The American embassy in Iraq today completely blocked news about Rountree's movements, admitting that this was to avoid further demonstrations and protests from the angry masses.

On the 15th, Iraqi newspapers strongly protested the "visit" of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree. Common headlines were "Rountree, get out," with other headlines including "Conspirator Rountree" and "War Envoy Rountree."

"Al-Umma" (The Nation) warned Rountree, "Without a doubt, you will feel the consequences of your visit, you will feel the presence of the Iraqi people, and recognize their true feelings."

The newspaper also pointed out, "We are not afraid of conspiracies, because our people are vigilantly defending our republic."

"Sawt al-Sha'b al-Hurr" (Voice of Free People) said to Rountree, "Get out, you emissary of the monopoly capitalists." The newspaper then pointed out that the purpose of Rountree's activities was to vainly attempt to restore the forces that had already been lost in Iraq. But this is impossible. The newspaper said, "This republic knows every plot you are scheming, our people remain vigilant, and forcefully defend the republic."

"Revolution" also pointed out that people all over the world are unanimously shouting: "Americans, get out."

The Iraqi Peace Committee issued a statement on the 15th protesting Rountree's "visit."

The statement said that Iraqi peace fighters expressed very deep unease about Rountree's "visit" and vehemently condemned his aggressive intentions.

The statement pointed out, "Experience has proven that the U.S. imperialists are the main planners of conspiracies and aggression against the people of the Middle East and the Arab countries."

The statement also said that the imperialists are continuing to plot conspiracies, providing conspirators with weapons and money, and inciting them to take risky actions. The statement continued, "Since the United States put pressure on Iraq to establish rocket bases threatening the republic, aggressive intentions and conspiracies against the Republic of Iraq have become increasingly apparent."

The statement concluded, "Many experiences have shown that every visit by an American envoy means the manufacturing of conspiracies and the planning of reactionary coups to overthrow patriotic regimes."

Telegrams from people protesting Rountree's "visit" continue to pour in from all over the country to various newspapers. The newspapers have already published about one hundred telegrams with tens of thousands of signatures.

    伊拉克人民怒逐美国阴谋家
    朗特里溜到巴格达  群众示威要他滚蛋
    本报综合报道  据新华社巴格达讯：美国助理国务卿朗特里15日下午在巴格达人民高呼“朗特里滚回去”的一片愤怒抗议声中到达这里。
    他一下飞机，机场工作人员就对他怒喊“阴谋家滚回去”。这时候，机场外面好几千人一面高呼“卑鄙的朗特里滚回去”等口号，一面挥舞着横幅和标语牌，这些标语牌等写着“我们的共和国无战争贩子容身之地”、“我们要的是生存和和平，不是死亡和战争”等口号。许多愤怒的示威的人还冲进了飞机场。
    朗特里为了躲避愤怒的示威群众，从机场的后门溜出去，但是当他坐着汽车经过时，人们继续向他唾骂，还有人用石子投掷他的汽车。从机场到美国大使馆，沿途也挂满了要求朗特里滚回去的标语，这一天的许多报纸都用通栏标题写着“朗特里滚回去！”城内许多墙上、车上、商店窗子上，旅馆的门口，都贴了表示同样情绪的标语。
    当新华社记者离开机场时，受到了那些要求朗特里滚蛋的群众的热情欢迎，他们高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”“伊拉克—中国友好万岁！”等口号。记者的车子十分钟才走了四十公尺。他们一直送记者到离机场一百公尺的地方。
    美国驻伊拉克大使馆今天完全封锁了关于朗特里的行动的消息，据承认是为了躲避愤怒的群众继续对他示威抗议。
    伊拉克各报15日都强烈抗议美国助理国务卿朗特里的“访问”。报上普遍的大标题是：“朗特里滚回去”，其它标题有，“阴谋策划者朗特里”，“战争使节朗特里”。
    “国家报”警告朗特里说，“毫无疑问，你将会感觉到你的访问的后果，你将会感觉到伊拉克人民的存在，并且认识到他们的真正的感情。”
    这家报纸又指出，“我们不害怕阴谋，因为我们的人民警惕地保卫着我们的共和国”。
    “自由人民之声报”对朗特里说，“滚回去，你这个垄断资本家的使节”。这家报纸接着指出，朗特里来活动的目的就是妄想恢复在伊拉克已经失去的势力。但是这是办不到的。这家报纸说，“这个共和国知道你所阴谋策划的每一件事，我们的人民保持着警惕，并且有力地保卫着共和国。”
    “革命报”也指出，全世界各地人民一致高呼：“美国人滚回去”。
    伊拉克和平委员会在15日发表声明，抗议朗特里的“访问”。
    声明说，伊拉克和平战士对于朗特里的“访问”表示非常深切的不安，并且激烈谴责他的侵略意图。
    声明指出，“经验证明，美帝国主义者是反对中东各国人民和阿拉伯各国人民的阴谋和侵略计划的主要策划者。”
    声明又说，帝国主义者正在继续策划阴谋，给阴谋分子武器和金钱，唆使他们采取冒险行动。声明接着说，“自从美国对伊拉克施加压力，要建立威胁共和国的火箭基地以来，针对伊拉克共和国的侵略意图和阴谋就日益明显了。”
    声明最后说，“许多经验表明，美国使节的每一次访问，都意味着制造阴谋和策划推翻爱国政权的反动政变。”
    抗议朗特里“访问”的人民来电仍然不断地从各地寄到各家报社。各报已经发表了约一百封共有几万人签名的电报。（附图片）
