    Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China has received the Soviet Women's Committee's appeal to the women of the world on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing.
    The book calls on people and women of all countries to rise up and demand that the governments of the United States and Britain immediately, universally, and permanently cease the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, ban the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, reduce armaments and armed forces, and use the funds used for military purposes to improve the people's living welfare.
    The book says: "Soviet women express extreme indignation at the US and British governments' response to the Soviet Union's lofty decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing with an unprecedented series of atomic weapons tests. The continuation of such tests threatens people's health and lives, threatens the fate of children and young people, and the future of the world.
    "The Soviet Union steadfastly adheres to a peaceful foreign policy and has re-submitted proposals to the United Nations General Assembly regarding the immediate, universal, and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing. We Soviet women unanimously support the Soviet government's humanitarian actions to eliminate the threat of atomic war and establish lasting peace."
    The book makes the following demands of the United Nations General Assembly: The United Nations must undertake its lofty mission in a responsible spirit; stop adopting delaying tactics, and take the only correct decision to immediately and permanently stop nuclear explosions as the first step toward banning the production and use of thermonuclear weapons. The book also calls for the conclusion of an agreement on the universal and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing in the near future.
    The appeal to the women of the world says: "Unity is our strength, and we must strengthen our struggle against the threat of atomic war."
