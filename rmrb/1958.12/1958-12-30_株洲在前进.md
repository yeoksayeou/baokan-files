    Zhuzhou Marches Forward
    By Our Correspondents Liu Yaoli and Zhu Yunfeng

    Amidst the great leap forward of all undertakings across the country in 1958, Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, is also rapidly changing its face at a pace of a thousand miles a day. Under the leadership of the Party, this emerging industrial city located on the banks of the Xiang River, where the Beijing-Guangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Hunan-Guizhou three railways intersect, is being built even more beautifully and magnificently.

    Before liberation, Zhuzhou City was just a small town with a population of over 7,000, belonging to Xiangtan County. However, in just the first Five-Year Plan period, this city entered the ranks of China's industrial cities. From 1953 to 1957, more than a dozen large-scale factories above the quota set by the state successively chose sites or started construction here. On the mountain slopes where weeds used to grow, tall factory buildings and chimneys puffing thick smoke can now be seen everywhere. Along the twenty-odd *li* of highway from the urban area to Baishigang, Tianxin, and Qingshuitang, a magnificent new industrial zone has been formed. The population of the city and suburbs has rapidly increased to more than 250,000.

    In this year’s construction upsurge, taking steel as the key link and with the whole Party and all the people running industry, Zhuzhou City's industrial construction has shown a new situation of taking the lead with thousands of horses galloping forward. This city, which had never produced steel before, built two new steel plants in the short five months after July this year. In particular, after launching mass steelmaking, it produced 7,100 tons of steel this year. Now, steelmaking furnaces, iron-smelting furnaces, and cement kilns are everywhere. Under the slogan of ensuring the triumph of steel, all units universally carried out communist cooperation, and the Zhuzhou Steel Plant was quickly completed. Subsequently, dozens of local state-owned factories, such as the Motor Factory, Welding Rod Factory, Auto Repair Factory, Bearing Factory, Wool Textile Factory, and Plastics Factory, sprang up like mushrooms after a rain.

    In the great leap forward year of 1958, Zhuzhou City not only saw great development in the iron and steel industry and local industries, but also in terms of basic construction, the state's key projects also moved forward at the fastest speed this year. The total investment in basic construction in 1958 is equivalent to the total of the first Five-Year Plan. The first phase of the Zhuzhou Ramie Textile Factory was completed and put into production this year. Now, bundles of high-quality, brightly colored high-grade ramie textiles have begun to be supplied to domestic and foreign markets. When all the projects of this factory are completed next year, it will form a joint enterprise of machinery manufacturing, textile, printing and dyeing. Its annual products can make a set of beautiful summer clothes for seven million people. Here, you can also see the magnificent factory buildings and towering chimneys of the modernized Zhuzhou Smelter, Chemical Plant, and Glass Factory. Some of these factories have completed infrastructure construction, some are still under construction, and some are installing machinery. They can all be put into production one after another next spring. After the Chemical Plant is completed, it will be able to produce more than a dozen major products such as phosphate fertilizer, pesticides, caustic soda, polyvinyl chloride, sulfuric acid, synthetic ammonia, and coke. The phosphate fertilizer it produces annually can meet the needs of 30 million to 40 million *mu* of farmland; the 666 technical powder produced can eliminate more than 100 kinds of insect pests after being processed by pesticide factories. The Zhuzhou Glass Factory was originally planned to be completed in 1959 and put into production in 1960, but it was built in only 288 days this year. The rolled glass workshop of this factory will start producing rolled glass, which cannot be produced in large quantities in our country, early next year.

    The original two large-scale old factories—Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and Xiangjiang Machine Factory—have also undergone huge expansion projects this year. The locomotive factory has been transformed from a repair factory into a factory that manufactures locomotives, passenger cars, and freight car carriages. Among the state's key projects, the Smelter, Glass Factory, Concrete Sleeper Factory, and other four large factories will be put into production in the spring of next year. The Coal Washing Plant, Ferroalloy Plant, Freight Car Factory, and others are gathering tens of thousands of workers to rush repairs.

    The rapid development of Zhuzhou's industry this year has also brought new problems. After the first phase of the Zhuzhou Thermal Power Plant was put into production in September last year, although it has increased Zhuzhou's power generation many times, the electricity is still not enough this year. Recently, in addition to the rapid expansion of the power plant, in order to solve the increasingly urgent need for electricity by industry, the city is launching a mass electricity generation campaign. Due to the rapid development of industrial construction, Zhuzhou Railway Station has found it difficult to adapt to this new situation. At present, Zhuzhou Railway Station is being expanded into the largest hub station on the Beijing-Guangzhou line.

    In Zhuzhou, with the great leap forward in industrial construction, cultural construction is also developing rapidly. In just half a year, the city has established 37 private primary and secondary schools, accounting for more than 60% of the original primary and secondary schools. It has also successively established seven secondary technical schools, one industrial vocational school, and one railway college. The combination of education and labor, and the participation of teachers and students in labor, has become a general trend. The city's cultural center, four cinemas and theaters, and a cultural palace club have become places for cultural activities for workers and citizens. Every holiday, workers always enjoy watching the excellent programs performed by the Zhuzhou Huaguxi Opera Troupe. In mid-December, Zhuzhou People's Broadcasting Station was also completed and started broadcasting.

    Guests who came to Zhuzhou in the early days would never have imagined that it was just a small town with a population of 7,000 before liberation when they saw this thriving scene of rapid progress. When people ride in new-type public buses and gallop on well-connected roads, no one would have imagined a story that happened before liberation: Nanjing Yongli Company prepared to build a factory here and transported three heavy-duty trucks, but as a result, they rusted due to the lack of roads. When guests see the clean city appearance and drink tap water, no one would have imagined that Zhuzhou City was famous for its many mosquitoes, many malaria cases, and much sewage before liberation. The nine years after liberation are such a short period of time, but our great Party and the working class have built it into a new industrial city famous throughout the country.

    The people of Zhuzhou like to talk about the changes in Zhuzhou and enthusiastically participate in the construction of Zhuzhou. They are even more encouraged by the beautiful development prospects of Zhuzhou. During the second Five-Year Plan period, more than ten key national projects will be put into production one after another. At that time, Zhuzhou will have a large-scale chemical industry complex needed for agricultural and industrial production, a magnificent central thermal power station, coal washing industry, non-ferrous metal industry, and building materials industry, as well as ramie textile industry and synthetic fiber industry that are greatly needed for people's lives.

    Zhuzhou City has Pingxiang, which produces coal, in the east, Wuhan and Daye, one of China's steel bases, in the north, Shuikoushan, which is rich in lead and zinc, Xiangtan, which produces manganese, and various counties in southern Hunan, which produce tungsten, as well as the Dongting Lake area, which is rich in rice, all distributed around it. These are all favorable conditions for Zhuzhou City to move forward by leaps and bounds. Under China's superior socialist system, the beautiful prospects of Zhuzhou's industrial construction will be more magnificent and more beautiful than now. (Attached picture)

    株洲在前进
    本报记者  刘耀黎  朱云风
    在1958年全国各项事业大跃进声中，湖南省株洲市也以一日千里的速度，迅速地在改变着自己的面貌。在党的领导下，这座位于湘江之滨，又是京广、浙赣、湘黔三条铁路交叉的新兴工业城市，是建设得更加美丽，更加雄壮了。
    株洲市在解放以前，只是有七千多人口、隶属于湘潭县的一个小市镇。可是，仅仅在第一个五年计划期间，这座城市就进入了我国工业城市的行列。从1953年到1957年，国家十多个限额以上的大工厂先后在这里选择厂址或开工兴建。在过去野草丛生的山坡上，现在到处可以看到高大的厂房，浓烟突突的烟囱。从市区到白石港、田心、清水塘二十来华里的公路两旁，已经形成了一个规模宏伟的新工业区。城市和郊区的人口，已经迅速增加到二十五万多人。
    在今年以钢为纲，全党全民办工业的建设高潮中，株洲市的工业建设出现了一马当先，万马奔腾的新局面，这座从来没有生产过钢的城市，今年7月以后短短五个多月中，新建了两个钢厂，特别是开展全民炼钢后，今年生产了七千一百吨钢。现在，炼钢炉、炼铁炉、水泥窑，遍地皆是。在确保钢帅升帐的口号下，各个单位普遍开展了共产主义大协作，株洲钢厂迅速建成。接着，电机厂、电焊条厂、汽车修配厂、轴承厂、毛纺厂、塑料厂等几十个地方国营工厂就如雨后春笋建立起来了。
    大跃进的1958年，株洲市不仅钢铁工业和地方工业有了很大的发展，在基本建设方面，国家的重点工程在今年内也以最快的速度向前迈进。1958年基本建设总投资，相当于第一个五年计划的总和。株洲苎麻纺织厂第一期工程是今年完工并开始投入生产的，现在，一捆捆质量优良、色彩鲜艳的高级麻纺品，已开始向国内外市场供应。这个工厂在明年全部工程完成后，将形成一个机器制造、纺织、印染联合企业。它每年的产品，可以给七百万人每人做上一套漂亮的夏装。在这里，还可以看到近代化的株洲冶炼厂、化工厂和玻璃厂宏伟的厂房和高耸云霄的烟囱。这些厂房，有的已经结束基建，有的还在施工，有的正在安装机器。它们在明年春天都可以先后投入生产。化工厂建成后，将能生产磷肥、农药、烧碱、聚氯乙烯、硫酸、合成氨、焦炭十多种主要产品，它每年所生产的磷肥可以满足三千万到四千万亩农田的需要；生产的六六六原药粉经农药厂加工后，可除一百多种虫害。株洲玻璃厂原来计划在1959年完工，1960年投入生产，但是今年仅用了二百八十八天时间就建成了。这个厂的压延玻璃车间，到明年初就将提前大量生产我国目前还不能生产的压延玻璃。
    原来的两个规模巨大的老厂——株洲机车车辆工厂和湘江机器厂，今年也进行了巨大的扩建工程。机车厂已由一个修理厂变成了制造机车和客车、货车车厢的工厂，在国家重点工程中，在明年的春天，冶炼厂、玻璃厂、混凝土轨枕厂等四个大厂投入生产。选煤厂、铁合金厂、货车厂等正集结了数以万计的工人赶修。
    株洲的工业今年这样迅速地发展，也带来了新的问题。株洲火力发电厂的第一期工程去年9月投入生产后，虽然把株洲的发电量提高了许多倍，但今年电还不够用。最近，除了发电厂正在快速扩建外，为了解决工业日益对电力迫切的需要，全市正开展一个全民办电运动。由于工业建设的迅速发展，株洲车站已很难适应这种新的形势，目前，正在将株洲车站扩建为京广线上最大的枢纽站。
    在株洲，随着工业建设的大跃进，文化建设也日新月异的发展。仅半年时间，全市就举办了民办中小学三十七所，占原有中小学60％以上，还先后成立了七所中等技术学校，一所工业专科学校和一所铁道学院。教育与劳动相结合、师生参加劳动已成为普遍风气。全市的一个文化馆，四个影剧院和一个文化宫俱乐部已成为工人和市民文化活动的场所。每当假日，工人们总是百看不厌地在那里欣赏株洲花鼓剧团演出的优秀节目。12月中旬，株洲人民广播电台也建成并开始播音了。
    当初来株洲的客人们看到这一日千里欣欣向荣的景象时，谁也不会想到在解放前它仅是一个七千人口的小镇。当人们坐着新型公共汽车，在四通八达的公路上奔驰时，谁也没想到解放前曾发生过的一个故事：南京永利公司准备在这里建厂，运来三部载重汽车，结果，因无路可通而锈坏了。当客人看到整洁的市容，喝用自来水的时候，谁也没想到株洲市在解放前是一个以蚊子多、疟疾多、污水多而著名的地方。解放后九年是一个多么短促的岁月，可是，我们伟大的党和工人阶级，却将它建设成了一个全国闻名的新兴工业城市。
    株洲的人们很喜欢谈论株洲的变化，热情地参加株洲的建设，他们更为株洲的美丽的发展远景所鼓舞。在第二个五年计划期间，国家十多项重点工程，将先后投入生产。那时，株洲将拥有为农业和工业生产需要的规模巨大的化工联合企业，有宏伟的中心火力发电站，有选煤工业、有色金属工业和建筑材料工业，还有为人民生活大量需要的麻纺织工业和合成纤维工业。
    株洲市东有产煤的萍乡，北有我国钢铁基地之一的武汉和大冶，盛产铅和锌的水口山、产锰的湘潭、产钨的湘南各县，以及盛产大米的洞庭湖滨，都分布在它的周围，这些都是株洲市大踏步前进的有利条件。在我国优越的社会主义制度下，株洲工业建设的美丽远景，将比现在更加雄壮，更加美丽。（附图片）
