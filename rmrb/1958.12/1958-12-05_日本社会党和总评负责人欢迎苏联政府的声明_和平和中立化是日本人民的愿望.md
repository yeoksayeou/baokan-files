Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 4th: People from all walks of life in Japan have expressed their welcome for the Soviet government's statement on the negotiations between Japan and the United States to revise the "Security Treaty."

    Okada Souji, Director of the International Bureau of the Japan Socialist Party, issued a statement expressing his agreement with the Soviet statement. He said that to maintain Japan's security, the only way is to urge the withdrawal of American troops from Japan, the removal of American bases in Japan, the return of Okinawa to Japan, and the realization of Japan's neutralization. This is the only path that is completely in line with the wishes of the Japanese people and the consistent position of the Socialist Party. Okada then strongly condemned Kondo Shinichi, Director of the Information and Culture Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for his slanderous remarks against the Soviet Union's "interference in Japan's internal affairs" regarding the Soviet statement. Okada demanded that the Japanese government carefully study the issues raised by the Soviet Union in its statement in order to safeguard Japan's security and Asian peace, and to ease international tensions.

    Tanehashi Shigeru, International Director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), expressed his heartfelt welcome for the Soviet statement, saying that it was a sincere statement issued by the Soviet Union based on its basic policy of peaceful coexistence.

    He said that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is defensive in nature and fundamentally different from the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese people must deepen their understanding of this matter.

    Tanehashi stated that Sohyo will further strengthen its struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and ultimately break down the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system.

    The "Akahata" newspaper published an editorial today, expressing its support for the Soviet statement and calling for the smashing of the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The newspaper pointed out that the attitude taken by the Kishi Nobusuke government towards this statement shows that it is determined to support the U.S. war policy to the end. "Akahata" called on the Japanese people to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's continued pursuit of U.S. imperialism and its policy of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union.

    日本社会党和总评负责人欢迎苏联政府的声明
    和平和中立化是日本人民的愿望
    新华社4日讯  东京消息：日本各界人士纷纷表示欢迎苏联政府就日美两国举行修改“安全条约”的谈判发表的声明。
    日本社会党国际局长冈田宗司发表谈话，表示同意苏联的声明。他说，要维护日本的安全，只有促使美军撤出日本，撤销美国在日本的基地，把冲绳归还日本，实现日本的中立化，这是同日本人民的愿望和社会党一贯的主张完全一致的唯一道路。冈田接着强烈谴责日本外务省情报文化局长近藤晋一就苏联的声明发表的诬蔑苏联“干涉日本内政”的谈话。冈田要求日本政府为了维护日本的安全和亚洲和平以及缓和国际紧张局势，仔细研究苏联在声明中所提出的问题。
    日本工会总评议会国际部长种桥茂表示衷心欢迎苏联的声明，他说，这是苏联根据和平共处的基本政策发表的真诚的声明。
    他说，中苏友好同盟互助条约是防御性的，和日美“安全条约”根本不同。必须使日本人民加深对这件事的认识。
    种桥表示，“总评”将进一步加强斗争，反对修改日美“安全条约”和岸信介政府的反动政策，打倒岸信介内阁，进而打破日美“安全条约”体系。
    “赤旗报”今天发表社论，表示支持苏联的这项声明，并且号召粉碎日美修改“安全条约”的阴谋。这家报纸指出，岸信介政府对这项声明所采取的态度表明，它无论如何是要支持美国的战争政策到底的。“赤旗报”号召日本人民反对岸信介政府继续追随美帝国主义和执行以中苏两国为敌的政策。
