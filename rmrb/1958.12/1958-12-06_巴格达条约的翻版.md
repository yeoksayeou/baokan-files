　　A Rehash of the Baghdad Pact
　　By Our Correspondent
　　The activities of the United States in signing new military treaties with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan have aroused serious unease and condemnation from the countries concerned. Not long ago, the Soviet government issued a statement warning against the United States and Iran signing a military treaty. Indian Prime Minister Nehru also pointed out that large-scale U.S. military aid to Pakistan is a danger to India. On December 3, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud told a reporter from the Eastern News Agency about the impact of the United States signing military treaties with Iran and Pakistan, believing that this approach would only create more tension in the Middle East. In Iraq, these aggressive activities by the United States have been opposed by widespread public opinion. Iraqi Ambassador to the United Arab Republic, Fayek Samarae, recently said at a press conference that the military treaty signed between the United States and Iran directly threatens the security of Iraq in military, economic, and political terms.
　　Why is the United States now manufacturing these bilateral military treaties? According to the United States, it seems to be for defending against the “Soviet threat” again. However, it seems that even the United States and its partners themselves do not believe how much deceptive effect this tattered banner still has. They have a guilty conscience and have always been tight-lipped about the contents of the treaty. But no matter how covert the activities of the United States are, it is not difficult for millions of people to see that these bilateral military treaties are by no means “defense” treaties, but aggression treaties, whose spearhead is not only directed at the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, but first and foremost at those countries in Asia and Africa that are striving for and defending national independence.
　　According to various sources, the military treaty signed between the United States and Iran stipulates that the United States will establish missile bases in southern Iran and submarine bases on the Persian Gulf coast. The United States can also station troops in Iran. Similarly, the United States and Turkey have agreed that U.S. air force, paratrooper, and armored forces will be stationed for a long time at the Adana base near the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic, and missile launch sites will be established in Turkey. The new military treaty signed between the United States and Pakistan is also aimed at turning Pakistan into a U.S. military base. It is very obvious that the United States will use these military treaties to further control the signatory countries militarily and drag them onto a dangerous road. This, of course, has nothing in common with the interests of national independence and security of Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan.
　　These new aggressive activities by the United States prove that it is not reconciled to its shameful failure in the Middle East in recent times. The thunder of the Iraqi revolution sounded, and the so-called Baghdad Pact was declared disintegrated. However, the United States believes that this is a great opportunity to further squeeze British influence out of the Middle East. The United States was originally not a formal member of the Baghdad Pact, but at the end of July this year, Dulles personally went to London to attend the Baghdad Pact Council meeting, which had lost Baghdad, and ambitiously declared that the United States would "assume all the obligations of this treaty organization." In early November, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining went to Ankara to chair the meeting of the Baghdad Pact Military Committee to discuss the military deployment of the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance." Subsequently, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy successively visited Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan to carry out activities to sign bilateral military treaties, preparing to use these treaties to replace the Baghdad Pact. These bilateral military treaties are actually a rehash of the Baghdad Pact. The difference from the past is that the United States has now openly become the leader of this treaty group, while throwing Britain aside.
　　The United States directly sending troops to invade Lebanon, the United States directly controlling the so-called Baghdad Pact, the United States greatly increasing its military bases in the Middle East, and the United States deciding to establish a Fifth Fleet in the Indian Ocean region, these are the main activities of the United States in the Middle East in the past six months. This most clearly proves that U.S. imperialism is the main enemy of the national independence movement in Asia and Africa.
　　These aggressive activities by the United States seriously threaten the peace and security of the vast areas of Asia and Africa and harm the independence and sovereignty of those countries participating in U.S. military treaties. This will only promote the development of the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries to safeguard peace and independence, and promote the development of their struggle against imperialism. The logic of history will continue to prove that the United States creating military treaties everywhere and building military bases everywhere will, in the final analysis, only harm itself.

    巴格达条约的翻版
    本报评论员
    美国同伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦签订新的军事条约的活动，已经引起有关国家的严重不安和谴责。不久以前，苏联政府发表声明，对美国和伊朗签订军事条约提出了警告。印度尼赫鲁总理也曾经指出，美国对巴基斯坦的大规模军事援助对印度是一种危险。12月3日，阿富汗首相达乌德向东方通讯社记者谈到美国同伊朗、巴基斯坦签订军事条约的影响问题，他认为这种做法只会在中东造成更加紧张的局势。在伊拉克，美国的这些侵略活动遭到广大舆论的反对。伊拉克驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使法耶克·萨马赖最近在记者招待会上说，美国同伊朗签订的军事条约，不论在军事方面、经济方面和政治方面，都直接威胁了伊拉克的安全。
    美国现在究竟为什么要制造这些双边军事条约呢？据美国说，似乎又是为了防御“苏联威胁”。但是，看来连美国及其伙伴们自己也不相信这个破烂幌子究竟还有多大欺骗作用了。他们做贼心虚，对于条约的内容始终讳莫如深。可是不管美国的活动如何隐蔽，千百万人民都不难看到，这些双边军事条约，决不是什么“防御”条约，而是侵略条约，其矛头不仅指向苏联和其他社会主义国家，而是首先指向亚洲和非洲的那些正在争取和维护民族独立的国家。
    据各方消息透露，美国同伊朗签订的军事条约规定，美国将在伊朗南部建立导弹基地，在波斯湾海岸建立潜水艇基地。美国并且可以在伊朗驻扎军队。同样的，美国和土耳其两国已经协议，美国空军、伞兵和装甲部队将长期驻在靠近阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区的亚达那基地，并将在土耳其建立导弹发射场。美国同巴基斯坦签订新的军事条约，也是为了把巴基斯坦变为美国军事基地。非常明显，美国利用这些军事条约，将要进一步从军事上控制这些条约的签字国，并把它们拖向危险的道路上去。这同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦的民族独立和安全利益当然是毫无共同之点的。
    美国这些新的侵略活动，证明了它对于最近时期在中东的可耻失败是不甘心的。伊拉克革命的雷声一响，所谓巴格达条约宣告解体了。可是，美国却认为这是进一步从中东地区排挤英国势力的大好机会。美国本来并不是巴格达条约的正式成员国，但是今年7月底杜勒斯亲自跑到伦敦参加失掉了巴格达的巴格达条约理事会会议，并且野心勃勃地宣称，美国要“承担这个条约组织的全部义务”。到了11月上旬，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁又到安卡拉主持巴格达条约军事委员会的会议，讨论了所谓“北层联盟”的军事部署问题。接着，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊连续访问伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦，进行签订双边军事条约的活动，准备用这些条约来代替巴格达条约。这些双边的军事条约实际上就是巴格达条约的翻版，和过去情况不同的是，现在美国已经公开成为这个条约集团的盟主，而把英国抛到一边去了。
    美国直接出兵侵略黎巴嫩，美国直接控制所谓巴格达条约，美国大肆增加它在中东的军事基地，此外，美国还决定在印度洋地区建立第五舰队，这就是最近半年来美国在中东地区的主要活动。这最清楚地证明了美帝国主义是亚非地区民族独立运动的主要敌人。
    美国这些侵略活动严重地威胁了亚非广大地区的和平与安全，损害了那些参加美国军事条约国家的独立和主权，这只会促进亚非各国人民维护和平与独立斗争的发展，促进他们反对帝国主义斗争的发展。历史的逻辑将继续证明，美国到处制造军事条约，到处建立军事基地，归根结底，只能是害人反害己而已。
