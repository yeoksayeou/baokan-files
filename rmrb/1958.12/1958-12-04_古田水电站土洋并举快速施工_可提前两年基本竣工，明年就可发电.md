Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou Electric Dispatch: The construction site of the first-stage, second-phase project of the Gutian Hydropower Station in Fujian Province is carrying out a mass movement in the concrete pouring work for the dam, widely adopting construction methods that combine indigenous and foreign techniques, greatly accelerating the construction speed. According to the current progress, the entire project can be shortened by two-thirds of the original plan, and can be basically completed by the end of this year, two years ahead of schedule, with high quality and quantity, and can start generating electricity in the first half of next year.

The main project of the first-stage, second-phase of the Gutian Hydropower Station—the gravity concrete dam—is 58 meters high, 50 meters wide at the base, and 5.5 meters wide at the top, requiring a total of 370,000 cubic meters of concrete to be poured. When pouring began in March this year, the progress of the project was slow because of a lack of boldness in innovation and a failure to launch a mass movement. In May this year, the Party Committee of the Minjiang Engineering Bureau of the CPC, after studying this situation and criticizing erroneous ideas such as "seeing things but not people," immediately made a decision, emphasizing putting politics in command, explaining the policies and tasks to the worker masses, and launching a mass movement of extensive airing of views, big debates, thus quickly setting off a mass movement to strive for high-speed construction. Subsequently, they implemented the policy of "indigenous methods first, combining indigenous and foreign methods," and launched a mass technical innovation movement. Whenever they encountered difficult problems or major measures, they universally mobilized workers to participate in discussions, so that many problems were solved smoothly through the joint research of workers and technical personnel. For example, how to implement high-block pouring and large-volume pouring under the conditions of insufficient raw materials and a lack of high mechanization, the engineering and technical personnel and designers of the engineering bureau repeatedly studied without results, but in the mass movement, after the engineering and technical personnel and workers jointly studied, they came up with methods such as using wood and bamboo structures to replace steel trusses, overcoming the difficulties of steel and machinery shortages, and successively created new records such as a single high-block pouring height of 23.2 meters and a pouring volume of 10,843.2 cubic meters. Their series of creative achievements have been repeatedly commended and congratulated by the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPC.

    古田水电站土洋并举快速施工
    可提前两年基本竣工，明年就可发电
    新华社福州电  福建省古田水电站一级二期工程建设工地在浇捣拦河大坝的混凝土工程中，大搞群众运动，广泛采用土洋结合的施工方法，大大加快了施工速度。按照目前进度来看，整个工程能比原计划缩短三分之二的时间，可以按质按量地提前两年在今年年底基本竣工，明年上半年能开始发电。
    古田水电站一级二期的主体工程——重力式混凝土拦河大坝，坝高达五十八公尺，底宽五十公尺，顶宽五公尺半，共计需要浇捣混凝土三十七万立方公尺。今年3月间开始浇捣时，由于不敢大胆创造和大搞群众运动，工程进展迟缓。今年5月间，中共闽江工程局党委会在研究了这种情况，批判了见物不见人等错误思想后，随即作出决定，强调政治挂帅，把方针任务向工人群众交代清楚，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，因而迅速掀起了一个力争高速度建设的群众运动。接着，他们又贯彻了土法上马、土洋并举的方针，开展了群众性的技术革新运动，一遇到疑难问题和每个重大措施就普遍发动工人参加讨论，使许多问题都在工人与技术人员共同研究之下顺利地解决了。例如在原材料不足和缺乏高度机械化条件下，如何实行高块浇捣和大体积浇捣，经过工程局工程技术人员和设计人员反复研究都未获结果，但在大搞群众运动中经过工程技术人员和工人们共同研究后，就想出了用木竹结构来代替钢桁架等办法，克服了钢材和机械缺乏等困难，先后创造了一次高块浇筑高度二十三点二公尺、浇筑量达一万零八百四十三点二立方公尺的新纪录。他们一系列的创造性成就，受到中共福建省委的一再表扬和祝贺。
