The Growing National Independence Movement

The flame of African national independence movements is sweeping across this rich continent, which has long suffered from the ravages of imperialism, with a prairie fire-like force. From Tangier to the Cape of Good Hope, more than 220 million Africans are waging unyielding struggles against the enemies who have been riding roughshod over them for centuries. Their slogans are: "Africans are masters of their own house!" and "Imperialists, get out of Africa!"

Only seven years ago, national independent countries were still as rare as stars at dawn on the African map. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Liberia were the only three independent countries at that time. Four-fifths of the African people were still under the bloody rule of imperialism. In 1951, Libya achieved independence. In 1956, Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia successively achieved independence. Last year, Ghana became independent. In recent months, Algeria and French Guinea have successively declared the establishment of independent republics. At present, the total African population that has achieved independence is nearly 90 million, exceeding one-third of the total African population! It is estimated that by 1960, Nigeria, Cameroon, Togo, and Italian Somaliland will also become independent countries. At that time, at least 130 million people will have broken away from the direct rule of imperialism and embarked on the road of national independence.

Africa is undergoing a great transformation. For hundreds of years, imperialists have regarded Africa as their rear for invading the world, and they have plundered unlimited manpower and material resources from here; today, Africa has changed into the front line for imperialism to carry out its death throes. A brand-new Africa will be born from the flames of struggle.

Continuously Strengthening Oneself in Struggle

The African people's struggle for independence and freedom is arduous, complex, and tortuous, but they are constantly strengthening their own strength in the struggle and showing greater and greater determination.

The United Arab Republic has waged tremendous heroic struggles in the past few years to defend and consolidate its hard-won national independence. In the face of the heroic people of the UAR, the successive military attacks, threats of force, economic blockades, and political divisions of the U.S., British, and French imperialists have been crushed one after another.

In Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and other independent African countries, the U.S., Britain, and France still maintain the military bases they established in the past and are competing for spheres of influence. The people of these countries still have the task of further striving for complete independence and territorial integrity.

The Algerian people's national liberation war has been going on for more than four years. The French colonialists' military suppression cannot stop the development of the national independence movement in the slightest. The establishment of the Provisional Government of Algeria marks a new stage in the national liberation war approaching final victory.

In the vast area south of the Sahara Desert, the national independence movement has made great progress. In French West Africa, the unity of national independent forces has been significantly strengthened. The African Democratic Union Congress held in September last year clearly declared: "The independence of all countries is an inalienable right." Subsequently, the main trade union organizations in West Africa also formed the General Confederation of Black African Workers at the end of last year, unifying the leadership of the West African workers' movement. This is of great significance for the development of the West African national independence movement.

De Gaulle's plot to annex French colonies has been severely hit. The independence of Guinea and the decision of Guinea and Ghana to establish the core of the West African Federation have had a tremendous impact in Africa, especially in West Africa.

The guerrilla warfare launched by the Cameroonian people has been going on for three years. The United Nations Trusteeship Council has passed a resolution requiring France to agree to Cameroon's independence in 1960. The United Nations Trusteeship Council has also made the same resolutions for Togo and Somaliland.

Although the national independence movement in Kenya was subjected to extremely cruel suppression by the British colonial authorities in the four years from 1952 to 1956, with 10,000 people sacrificing their lives and 70,000 people being imprisoned in concentration camps, the Kenyan people's struggle is continuing. Britain has also been forced to agree to Nigeria's independence in 1960.

The broad masses of African people are increasingly aware that only through unity and resolute struggle against imperialism can the national independence movement develop and grow stronger. The Conference of Independent African States held in April this year reflected this strong demand. The All-African People's Conference will also open in Accra soon. These are all events of great significance.

Imperialists Will Not Voluntarily Get Out of Africa

Imperialists will not voluntarily get out of Africa. The military aggressions they have repeatedly launched in the Middle East prove that they are trying their best to cut off the expansion of the national independence movement from Asia to Africa. Old colonialists such as Britain, France, and Belgium are frantically struggling in the face of the prairie fire of the national independence movement in order to maintain the source of maximum profits and strategic rear in Africa.

French imperialism is not only expanding the colonial war in Algeria, but also intensifying military suppression of the Cameroonian people. The independence of Guinea has been subjected to various threats and resistance from French imperialism. France's recent forced recognition of French Sudan, Madagascar, Chad, Mauritania, and Gabon as republics within the French "Community" is an attempt to prevent these countries from following Guinea's path to independence through actual military, political, and economic control.

British imperialism is also intensifying the use of force to suppress and provoke division, attempting to undermine the increasingly high tide of the national independence movement in British colonies in Africa. In Kenya, Britain has begun to build a huge military base. The British War Office admits that barracks are under construction, which is only "part of Britain's long-term plan," and the entire plan "will not be completed in two or three years." Obviously, this British plan is not only aimed at the Kenyan people, but also at the people of the British colonies in neighboring areas.

Although Britain has been forced to agree to Nigeria's independence in October 1960, it is using the so-called "national question" to try its best to create internal divisions in Nigeria.

In addition, Britain is playing tricks such as revising the constitution and electing members of parliament in Uganda, the Central African Federation, and other regions to deceive the people in these regions. In September this year, the British Colonial Secretary proposed suggestions on the constitution of the Central African Federation, agreeing that two Africans should serve as ministers in the Executive Council. On the surface, this seems to be a concession from the British colonial authorities, but in essence, it does not affect the absolute power of the British Governor at all. As for the first legislative council election in Uganda, it is an obvious fraud. According to the regulations of the British colonial authorities, only those who have owned land for more than two years, have been employed for more than seven years, or have a cash income of more than 100 pounds per year are eligible to vote. This so-called election has no other effect than to whitewash colonial rule.

All these facts show that the African people still need to carry out arduous and resolute struggles, defeat the military suppression and political conspiracies of the colonialist forces, and then they can get rid of the shackles of colonialism.

The United States' Colonial Expansion in Africa

The United States is taking advantage of the weakening of old colonial countries such as Britain and France and the economic difficulties of the newly independent African countries to intensify its colonial expansion activities in Africa.

On the surface, the United States has no colonies in Africa. However, at present, the United States is playing a double-dealing trick and carrying out colonial expansion in Africa. On the one hand, the United States pretends to express "sympathy and support" for the goals of African nationalism, and on the other hand, it advocates that African countries should establish so-called "new mutually beneficial alliances" with old colonial countries. At the same time, the United States uses these guises to carry out aggressive activities, disintegrate the national independence movement, and squeeze out old colonial forces in order to expand the United States' sphere of influence. The United States openly declares that the era of "individual colonialism" in Africa is over, and the United States should play a leading role in the new "collective." This is an attempt to replace the old colonialist forces and establish the United States' hegemony in Africa.

At present, in most African regions, the United States' huge investment is increasingly occupying a dominant position. From the end of World War II to 1956, the United States' private investment in Africa was only more than 510 million U.S. dollars, but the total amount of loans from the U.S. government and through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development reached as much as 3 billion U.S. dollars. American journalist Lechie said: "Imperialism—this dirty word represents our expanding interests in Africa. The project of the United States developing the huge mineral resources of this continent alone is enough to show that nineteenth-century Britain, France, Belgium, and Portugal are dwarfed by the United States."

U.S. "aid" in Africa, like in other regions, has played the role of a pioneer in the United States' colonial expansion. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite recently advocated continuing to expand this "aid" activity. He said: "No one can be indifferent" to the development of the national independence movement, and the United States' response is to "quickly, generously, and wisely" provide "sufficient economic and technical assistance" to "underdeveloped countries" in Africa. At present, an American delegation led by James Smith, Director of the United States International Cooperation Administration, and Satterthwaite is conducting activities in Africa to promote U.S. "aid."

The expansion of U.S. imperialism in Africa has caused profound contradictions between it and the old colonialist countries. The African people are also increasingly clearly aware of the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism. The United States' attempt to rely on dollar temptation and political conspiracies to achieve the goal of dominating Africa is destined to fail.

Africa's Friends Are All Over the World

The African national independence movement is an important part of the worldwide struggle for peace, democracy, and national independence. The socialist camp and all progressive mankind deeply sympathize with and support the suffering and struggle of the African people.

The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 resolutely supported the just struggle of the African people. Among the twenty-nine Asian and African countries participating in this conference, there were six African countries. These are Egypt, Ethiopia, the Gold Coast, Liberia, Libya, and Sudan.

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo at the end of last year gave broad and firm support to the African national independence movement. Nearly fifty delegations from countries and regions participated in this conference, of which nearly half were from Africa. The conference solemnly declared: "The continued existence of imperialism is incompatible with the new era in which it is now located." The conference declared that all colonies and protectorates, and all trust territories have the right to rapidly achieve complete independence.

The "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" movement recently initiated by the Standing Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council is of great significance for the further development of the African national independence movement. Under the current situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, imperialism is already in decline and is besieged on all sides in Africa. No matter how hard the imperialists struggle and resist, the days when they will get out of Africa and all its colonies are not far away. (Attached image)

    非洲民族独立运动烈火燎原
    陶恺
    民族独立运动日益发展
    非洲民族独立运动的火焰，正以燎原之势，燃遍了这个饱受帝国主义蹂躏的富饶的大陆。从丹吉尔到好望角，二亿二千多万非洲各族人民正在和骑在他们头上几个世纪之久的敌人，进行百折不挠的斗争。他们的口号是：“非洲人民当家自主！”“帝国主义滚出非洲去！”
    仅仅在七年以前，民族独立国家在非洲地图上还是寥若晨星。埃及、埃塞俄比亚和利比里亚是当时仅有的三个独立国家。五分之四的非洲人民仍然处在帝国主义的血腥统治之下。1951年，利比亚取得了独立。1956年，苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯相继取得独立。去年，加纳独立。最近几个月里，阿尔及利亚、法属几内亚先后宣布成立独立的共和国。目前，取得独立的非洲总人口已近九千万人，超过非洲总人口的三分之一！预计到1960年，尼日利亚、喀麦隆、多哥、意属索马里兰也将成为独立的国家。那时，最少将有一亿三千万人口摆脱了帝国主义的直接统治，走上了民族独立的大道。
    非洲正在经历着一个伟大的变革。几百年来帝国主义者一直把非洲视为它们侵略世界各地的后方，它们从这里掠夺了无限的人力和物力；今天，非洲已经一变而为帝国主义进行垂死挣扎的前线了。一个崭新的非洲将从斗争的烈火中诞生出来。
    在斗争中不断壮大自己
    非洲人民争取独立自由的斗争，是艰巨、复杂和曲折的，但他们正在从斗争中不断地壮大自己的力量，显示出越来越大的坚定性。
    阿拉伯联合共和国几年来进行了巨大的英勇斗争，捍卫和巩固得来不易的民族独立。在英勇的阿联人民面前，美英法帝国主义接二连三的军事进攻、武力威胁、经济封锁和政治分化等等侵略活动，一个一个地被击破了。
    在摩洛哥、突尼斯、利比亚和其他非洲独立国家中，美英法仍然保持着过去建立的军事基地，进行争夺势力范围的角逐。这些国家的人民仍然有进一步争取完全的独立和领土主权完整的斗争任务。
    阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放战争，已经进行了四年多。法国殖民主义者的军事镇压，丝毫也不能阻止民族独立运动的发展。阿尔及利亚临时政府的成立，标志着民族解放战争进入了接近最后胜利的新阶段。
    在撒哈拉沙漠以南的广大地区，民族独立运动有了很大发展。在法属西非，民族独立力量的团结已经有了显著的加强。去年9月召开的非洲民主联盟代表大会，明确地宣布：“各国人民的独立是一种不可让与的权利”。接着，西非的主要工会组织也在去年年底组成了黑非洲总工会，统一领导西非的工人运动。这对于西非民族独立运动的发展都具有重大的意义。
    戴高乐并吞法属殖民地的阴谋，遭到了沉重打击。几内亚的独立，几内亚和加纳建立西非联邦的核心的决定，在非洲特别是在西非洲引起了巨大的影响。
    喀麦隆人民发动的游击战争已经进行了三年之久。联合国托管委员会已经作出决议，要求法国同意喀麦隆在1960年取得独立。联合国托管委员会还对多哥和索马里兰作出了相同的决议。
    怯尼亚的民族独立运动，虽然在1952年到1956年四年中遭到了英国殖民当局极其残酷的镇压，有一万人牺牲了生命，七万人被关进集中营，但是怯尼亚人民的斗争在继续进行中。英国也已被迫同意尼日利亚在1960年取得独立。
    广大的非洲人民日益认识到，只有团结一致，和帝国主义进行坚决斗争，民族独立运动才能发展壮大。今年4月举行的非洲独立国家会议，反映了这一强烈要求。最近全非洲人民大会也将在阿克拉开幕。这都是具有重要意义的事件。
    帝国主义者不会自动滚出非洲
    帝国主义者是不会自动滚出非洲的。它们在中东一再发动的军事侵略，证明它们竭力企图斩断民族独立运动从亚洲向非洲的扩展。英、法、比利时等旧殖民主义者为了在非洲保持最大利润的泉源和战略后方，正在民族独立运动的燎原烈火面前，进行疯狂挣扎。
    法国帝国主义不仅正在扩大阿尔及利亚殖民战争，而且加紧对喀麦隆人民进行军事镇压。几内亚的独立，受到了法帝国主义的种种威胁和抵制。法国最近被迫承认法属苏丹、马达加斯加、乍得、毛里塔尼亚和加蓬成为法国“共同体”内的共和国，是企图以军事、政治和经济的实际控制，来阻止这些国家效法几内亚而走上独立的道路。
    英帝国主义也在加紧运用武力镇压和挑拨分化等手法，企图破坏非洲英属殖民地日益高涨的民族独立运动。在怯尼亚，英国已经开始了建筑庞大的军事基地。英国陆军部承认，兵营已在建造中，这仅是英国“长远计划的一部分”，全部计划“在二、三年里是不会完成的”。显然，英国这个计划不仅针对着怯尼亚人民，而且也针对着邻近地区的英国殖民地的人民。
    英国虽已被迫同意尼日利亚在1960年10月独立，但是它正在利用所谓“民族问题”竭力制造尼日利亚内部的分裂。
    此外，英国在乌干达、中非联邦等地区，正在玩弄修订宪法、议员选举等手法，来欺骗这些地区的人民。今年9月，英国殖民大臣曾经提出关于中非联邦宪法的建议，同意在行政会议中有两名非洲人担任部长。表面上，这好像是英国殖民当局的让步，实质上却丝毫也不影响英国总督的绝对权力。至于乌干达的第一次立法议会选举，更是明显的骗局。按英国殖民当局规定，必须要拥有土地两年以上、就业七年以上或每年有一百英镑以上的现金收入的人，才能得到选举权。这种所谓选举，除了粉饰殖民统治外，是没有任何作用的。
    这一切事实，都说明了非洲人民还需要进行艰巨的坚决的斗争，击破殖民主义势力的军事镇压和政治阴谋，才能摆脱殖民主义的枷锁。
    美国对非洲的殖民扩张
    美国正在利用英法等老牌殖民国家遭到削弱和新独立的非洲国家经济困难的情况，加紧对非洲的殖民扩张活动。
    在表面上，美国在非洲是没有殖民地的。但是，目前美国正在玩弄两面三刀手法，在非洲进行殖民扩张。美国一方面假意表示“同情和支持”非洲民族主义的目标，一方面主张非洲国家应同旧殖民国家建立所谓“新的互利的联盟”，与此同时，美国利用这些幌子进行侵略活动，瓦解民族独立运动，排挤旧殖民势力，以扩大美国的势力范围。美国公然宣称，非洲“个体的殖民主义”时代已经结束，美国应当在新的“集体”中起首要作用。这就是企图取代旧殖民主义势力，建立美国在非洲的霸权。
    目前，在大部分非洲地区内，美国的巨大投资，日益占着压倒的地位。从第二次世界大战结束到1956年，美国在非洲的私人投资仅是五亿一千多万美元，但是美国政府和通过国际复兴开发银行的贷款总数却达三十亿美元之多。美国记者勒希说：“帝国主义——这个肮脏的字眼代表我们在非洲的扩张利益。仅仅美国开发这个洲的巨大矿源的工程项目单就足以表明，十九世纪英国、法国、比利时和葡萄牙比起美国来是小巫见大巫”。
    美“援”在非洲和在别的地区一样，起了美国殖民扩张的先行官的作用。美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿萨脱斯威特最近主张继续扩大这种“援助”活动，他说：对于民族独立运动的发展，“任何人都不可以满不在乎”，而美国的应付办法，就是“迅速地、大方地和明智地”对非洲“不发达国家给以充分的经济和技术援助”。目前，一个以美国国际合作署长詹姆斯·史密斯和萨脱斯威特为首的美国代表团，正在非洲进行活动，推销美“援”。
    美帝国主义在非洲的扩张，引起了它同旧殖民主义国家的深刻矛盾。非洲人民也越来越清楚地认识到美帝国主义的侵略野心。美国想依靠美元诱惑和政治阴谋，来达到统治非洲的目的，是注定要失败的。
    非洲人民的朋友遍天下
    非洲民族独立运动，是全世界争取和平民主和民族独立的斗争的一个重要组成部分。社会主义阵营以及一切进步人类都对非洲人民的苦难和斗争，寄予深切的同情和支持。
    1955年4月在万隆举行的亚非会议，坚决地支持了非洲人民的正义斗争。参加这次会议的二十四个亚非国家中，有六个非洲国家。这就是埃及、埃塞俄比亚、黄金海岸、利比里亚、利比亚和苏丹。
    去年年底在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会，对非洲民族独立运动给予广泛的、坚决的支持。参加这次会议的国家和地区的代表团近五十个，其中来自非洲的几近一半。会议庄严地宣布：“帝国主义的继续存在和现在所处的新时代是不相容的”。大会宣布，一切殖民地和保护国、所有受托管的国家都有权利迅速取得完全独立。
    最近亚非人民团结理事会常设秘书处发起的“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的运动，对于非洲民族独立运动的进一步发展，具有重大意义。在目前东风压倒西风的形势下，帝国主义已经日薄西山，在非洲也陷于四面楚歌的境地。不管帝国主义怎样挣扎顽抗，它们滚出非洲和其一切殖民地的日子已经为期不远了。（附图片）
