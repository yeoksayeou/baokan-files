Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd — According to a TASS report from New York on December 21st: The Venezuelan "Popular Tribune" published a joint declaration of the Communist Parties of Latin American countries. Representatives of the Communist Parties of Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, gathered in Santiago to attend the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of Chile, stated with satisfaction in this declaration that in various Latin American countries, democratic legal systems have been restored or are being restored due to the activities of the working class and various progressive groups.
    The declaration stated that this democratization process now has great significance for the struggle for national liberation, social progress, and universal peace. Precisely for this reason, imperialists and their agents are attempting to obstruct the development of this process; using all their strength to maintain some governments that employ terrorist activities; making it difficult for governments that act constitutionally; maintaining and deepening the instability of constitutional regimes in various countries; and plotting coups d'état as they did in Guatemala, attempting to carry out criminal intervention activities; and instigating new persecutions against the working class and the most determined patriots. The declaration pointed out that in this situation, international solidarity on a global scale and in Latin America is of decisive significance. Therefore, it is more necessary than ever to mobilize the democratic and progressive forces of all countries to oppose these plans and support the struggle of the Latin American people for democracy, independence, and peace.
    The declaration stated that representatives of the Communist Parties of various countries warmly welcome the growing awareness of the desire for peace in their own countries, and warmly welcome the development of diplomatic, cultural, and trade relations with socialist countries. This relationship is an effective and necessary support for the cause of strengthening the national independence, progress, and happiness of the Latin American people.
    The declaration pointed out that maintaining peace is closely linked to the struggle for the independence of the people of their own countries. The declaration expressed support for the actions of the people of their respective countries in refusing to provide military bases, refusing to conclude regional treaties, and refusing to cede national wealth. The declaration also called for the prohibition of atomic weapons, a complete cessation of atomic weapons testing, and the conclusion of a general disarmament agreement.
    The representatives of the Communist Parties of various countries who signed the declaration condemned imperialist military provocations in the Middle East and the Far East, and declared that the people of the Western Hemisphere actively support the liberation struggle of Algeria and other countries for their independence, and called on the working people, youth, and all patriots of Latin America to be vigilant against the provocations and chauvinism incited by imperialism to provoke conflicts between Latin American countries.
    The declaration condemned the rampant attacks of American monopoly capital, believing that the purpose of these attacks is to obtain new oil concessions and other raw material production areas in Latin America. The declaration expressed support for the widespread movement being carried out by workers and all people in Latin America, especially Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, to protect national wealth and national sovereignty. The declaration warmly called on the working class and all patriots to maintain unity and fighting spirit to smash the imperialists and prevent them from plundering these riches. The declaration also condemned the reactionaries' destruction of the education system and national culture.
    The declaration emphasized that the Latin American people, striving to achieve these lofty goals, are inspired by the achievements of the socialist countries, and they gain strength in the struggle for peace and national independence. The Latin American people welcome the bold goals put forward by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries to surpass capitalism in all aspects of production and to guarantee the historical task of peace.

    拉丁美洲国家共产党联合宣言  
    号召爱国者团结粉碎帝国主义阴谋
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社纽约21日讯：委内瑞拉“人民论坛报”发表了拉丁美洲国家共产党联合宣言。为参加智利共产党第十一次全国代表大会而齐集圣地亚哥的阿根廷、玻利维亚、古巴、智利、巴拉圭、秘鲁、乌拉圭和委内瑞拉各国共产党的代表在这一宣言中满意地指出，在拉丁美洲各国，由于工人阶级和各进步团体的活动，民主法制已经恢复或正在恢复之中。
    宣言中说，这一民主化的过程现在对争取民族解放、社会进步和普遍和平的斗争具有重大的意义。正因如此，帝国主义者及其代理人企图阻挠这一过程的发展；用全力来保持一些采取恐怖活动的政府；使那些依宪法行事的政府的活动发生困难；保持和加深各国宪法政权的不稳定性；并像他们在危地马拉所干的那样阴谋制造政变，企图进行罪恶的干涉活动；怂恿对工人阶级和最坚决的爱国者进行新的迫害。宣言指出，在这种情况下，世界范围内的以及拉丁美洲的国际团结具有决定性的意义，因此发动各国的民主力量和进步力量来反对这些计划和支持拉丁美洲人民争取民主、独立和和平的斗争，这比任何时候都更为必要。
    宣言中说，各国共产党代表热烈欢迎自己国家中自觉地争取和平愿望的增长，热烈欢迎同社会主义国家的外交、文化、贸易关系的发展，这种关系是对加强拉丁美洲人民的民族独立、进步和幸福的事业的有效而必要的支持。
    宣言指出，保持和平同争取自己国家人民独立的斗争有密切的联系。宣言表示支持本国人民拒绝提供军事基地，拒绝缔结区域性的条约和出让民族财富的行动。宣言同时要求禁止原子武器，彻底停止原子武器试验和要求缔结总的裁军协定。
    在宣言上签字的各国共产党代表谴责帝国主义在中东和远东的军事挑衅，并声明西半球人民积极声援阿尔及利亚等国争取自己独立的解放斗争，并且号召拉丁美洲的劳动人民、青年和全体爱国者要对帝国主义为挑拨拉丁美洲国家之间的冲突而鼓动的挑衅和沙文主义保持警惕。
    宣言谴责美国垄断资本的猖狂进攻，认为这种进攻的目的是要获得新的石油开采权和获得拉丁美洲的其他原料产地。宣言表示支持拉丁美洲、尤其是阿根廷、玻利维亚、智利、秘鲁、乌拉圭和委内瑞拉的劳动者和全体人民正在为保护民族财富和民族主权而广泛展开的运动。宣言热烈号召工人阶级和全体爱国者保持团结和战斗的精神以粉碎帝国主义者并且制止他们掠夺这些财富。宣言还谴责反动派对教育制度和民族文化的摧残。
    宣言强调指出，争取达到这些崇高目的的拉丁美洲人民，从社会主义国家所获得的成就中得到了鼓舞，他们获得争取和平、国家独立的力量。拉丁美洲人民欢迎苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家为完成在生产的各个方面超过资本主义和保证和平的历史任务而提出的大胆目标。
