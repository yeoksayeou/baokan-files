Colorful clouds fly as mountains surge like waves, carried by the east wind into the heavens.
With imposing might, the Steel General arrives, loud laughter echoing in all directions.
The clear sky is as blue as the sea, birds chirping in joyful chorus.
The Steel General leads me to see the land, the sound of jubilation rises like the tide.
Crossing a thousand rivers, passing over cities and villages.
Furnaces stand like forests across the land, chimneys pierce the sky, holding up the sun.
Rolling red clouds cover the motherland, golden stars fall beside the Milky Way.
The Party's banner is held high, mountains bow to make way.
A thousand-foot tree grows in one year of the Great Leap Forward, the pillars of socialism.
Everyone raises their arms to welcome the Steel General, eager to follow the Steel General to greet the spring.
Leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again, building a golden bridge to paradise.
Just see the Steel General wave his hand, urging us onward with swift pace.
Taking steel as the key link, banners unfurl, songs of victory resound on the road to success.
The Three Mountains and Five Peaks echo in unison, vowing to win a great victory next year.
Heaven and earth are as one, with force like the Yellow River pouring from the sky.
Joy in the heart is hard to express, I write a poem in praise of steel!

    迎钢帅凯旋
    沙鸥彩霞纷飞山如浪，驾着东风把天上。威风凛凛钢元帅，嚷嚷笑声震四方。万里晴空蓝如海，群鸟争鸣好欢畅。钢帅领我看大地，欢腾之声如潮涨。跨过江河一千条，越过城市和村庄。高炉如林遍山野，烟囱穿天托太阳。滚滚红云罩祖国，金星飞落银河旁。党的帅旗高高举，高山折腰把路让。跃进一年千丈树，社会主义有栋梁。人人举臂迎钢帅，愿跟钢帅赶春光。跃进跃进再跃进，架座金桥通天堂。只见钢帅挥挥手，快马加鞭奔远方。以钢为纲旌旗展，胜利道上歌声扬。三山五岳齐呼应，明年要打大胜仗。天上人间那可分，劲如黄河泻天上。心中欢喜难说尽，写下颂钢诗一章！
