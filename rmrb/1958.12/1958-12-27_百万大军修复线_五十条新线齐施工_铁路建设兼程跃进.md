Xinhua News Agency, 26th: This year, China's railway construction has surpassed any previous year in terms of both construction scale and track-laying length. In order to adapt to the needs of the flying leap in the national economy with steel as the key link, about fifty new railway lines are under construction simultaneously this year, and more than twenty existing railway lines are undergoing double-tracking or reconstruction. Thanks to the strengthened leadership of local Party committees and the mobilization of the entire population to participate in railway construction, the speed of railway construction has been greatly accelerated. The Ministry of Railways estimates that the total track-laying mileage of new and double-tracked railways across the country this year will reach 2,300 kilometers, an increase of about 100% compared to 1957. At the same time, the roadbed and bridge projects for over 3,000 kilometers of railways have been basically completed.

    The grand spectacle of the whole Party and the whole people building railways this year is prominently reflected in the double-tracking construction of the Beijing-Guangzhou and Tianjin-Shanghai (i.e., Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing) lines. In order to strengthen the transportation capacity of these two major north-south lines as soon as possible, eight provinces and cities along the lines mobilized a labor army of more than one million people, who worked with the railway construction team workers with soaring enthusiasm. In just two or three months, nearly 100 million cubic meters of roadbed earthwork and stonework for these two double-tracked lines, except for some sections, have been basically completed. 1,800 bridges and culverts have also been completed, and more than 500 kilometers of track-laying work has been completed. It would have been difficult to complete such a huge project in such a short period of time if only relying on the workers of the railway department.

    Several new railway lines have been completed this year and opened to traffic successively. These include: the second major transportation artery from North China to Northwest China—the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, the railway from Nanping on the Yingxia Line to Fuzhou, and the railway from Lianjiang on the Li-Zhan (Lianjiang-Zhanjiang) Line to Maoming, the emerging man-made petroleum base in South China. Although only 140 kilometers of track were laid on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway this year, reaching Tianchi Lake in Xinjiang, the roadbed and bridges for more than 300 kilometers from Tianchi Lake to Xiaocaohu have also been basically completed. The construction team has now crossed the Tianshan Mountains, passed Urumqi, and arrived at Wulawusu, about 300 kilometers away from the border. The He'kou to Xining section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, which only started construction in May this year, has also completed the roadbed and most of the bridge projects. In the southwest region of towering mountains, new achievements have been made this year in the construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou, Neijiang-Kunming, Chengdu-Kunming, and Yunnan-Guizhou railways, as well as the Duyun to Guiyang section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway. Of the sixty-five tunnels on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, forty-eight have been started; of the twenty-nine large bridges, twenty-three have been started. The main projects of the Wujiang Bridge, which spans the Wujiang River, have been completed, and the Loushan Pass Tunnel has also been completed. These are both key projects on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. The Neijiang-Kunming Railway has laid tracks to Yibin. The railway from Duyun to Guiyang can be laid to Guiyang by the end of the year.

    The remaining main railways under construction this year, such as the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, the Ningbo-Ganzhou Railway that runs through the hinterland of the southeast, the railway from Zhan'dian north of Zhengzhou on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway to Dongguan on the Southern Tongpu Railway, the railway from Chengdu through the central Sichuan petroleum area to Nanchong (which is a section of the planned Sichuan-Henan Railway), and the forest railways extending in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains, have all made progress of varying lengths.

    Thanks to the high degree of enthusiasm shown by the railway workers, railway soldiers, and civilian workers, and the improved construction methods, railway construction this year has created unprecedented records in tunnels, bridges, track-laying, and roadbed earthwork and stonework. The workers building the Xiaoshuicun Tunnel near Wujiang on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway took only a little over ten days to complete the 220-meter-long lower pilot tunnel. This project would not have been completed in one or two months in the past. The construction of some medium-sized bridges on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway double-track also took only three to five days to complete.

### 百万大军修复线  五十条新线齐施工  铁路建设兼程跃进

    百万大军修复线  五十条新线齐施工
    铁路建设兼程跃进
    新华社26日讯  今年我国铁路建设无论在施工规模和铺轨长度方面都超过了以往任何一年。为了适应以钢为纲的国民经济飞跃发展的需要，今年约有五十条新的铁路线同时施工，二十多条原有铁路线进行复线建设或改建。由于各地党委加强了领导，动员了全民的力量参加修铁路，使铁路建设的速度大大地加快了。据铁道部预计，今年全国新线和复线铁路的铺轨里程将达到二千三百公里，比1957年增长一倍左右，同时还有三千公里以上的铁路，基本上完成了路基和桥梁工程。
    今年全党全民大修铁路的盛况，突出地表现在京广和津沪（即津浦和沪宁）的复线建设上。为了尽快地加强这两条南北大干线的运输能力，沿线八个省、市共动员了一百多万劳动大军，他们和铁路工程队的职工一起建设复线，干劲冲天。仅仅两三个月的时间，这两条复线近一亿立方公尺的路基土石方工程，除部分区段外，就已经基本上完成了；桥涵工程也已经完成了一千八百座，铺轨工程完成了五百多公里。在这样短的时间内，完成这样浩大的工程，如果仅仅靠铁路部门的职工，那是难以办到的。
    有好几条铁路新线在今年建成，并先后通车。其中包括：从华北到西北的第二条运输大动脉——包兰铁路，从鹰厦线上的南平通到福州的铁路，以及从黎（塘）湛（江）线上的廉江到华南新兴的人造石油基地茂名的铁路。兰新铁路今年虽然只铺轨一百四十公里，到达新疆的天湖，但是从天湖到小草湖三百多公里的路基、桥梁也已经基本上完成。现在施工队伍已经跨过天山，越过乌鲁木齐，到达了离国境线约有三百公里的乌拉乌苏。今年5月才开工的兰青铁路河口到西宁段，路基和绝大部分桥梁工程也已经完工。在崇山峻岭的西南地区，川黔、内昆、成昆、滇黔等铁路和黔桂路都匀到贵阳段的建设，今年都取得了新的成就。川黔铁路六十五座隧道，已有四十八座开工；二十九座大桥，已有二十三座开工。横跨乌江天险的乌江大桥，桥墩、桥台等主体工程已经完工，娄山关大隧道也打通了。这两个都是川黔铁路上的关键工程。内昆路已铺轨到宜宾。都匀到贵阳的铁路年底可以铺轨到贵阳。
    其余在今年施工的主要铁路，如湘黔铁路、纵贯东南腹地的宁赣铁路、从京广路上郑州以北的詹店到南同蒲路东观的铁路、从成都穿过川中石油区到南充的铁路（这是计划修筑的川豫铁路的一段），以及伸展在大小兴安岭和长白山的森林铁路等，都取得了不同长度的进展。
    由于修路职工、铁道兵和民工发挥了高度的积极性，改善了施工方法，今年铁路建设无论在隧道、桥梁、铺轨和路基的土石方工程等方面，都创造了前所未有的纪录。建设川黔铁路乌江附近小水村隧道的职工，只用十天多的时间就把全长二百二十多公尺的下导洞打通了，这个工程如果在以前，没有一两个月的时间是完不成的。京广铁路复线上有些中桥的修建，也只用三、五天工夫就建成了。
