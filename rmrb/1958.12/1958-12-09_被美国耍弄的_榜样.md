　　The "Example" Being Played by the United States
　　Recently, the U.S. "Mainichi Shimbun" made a big fuss about Philippine President Garcia's "visit" to Japan, saying that this "may mark a historically significant turning point in postwar world affairs," and that it "set an example in the style of Garcia."

　　What kind of remarkable thing is this? The "Mainichi Shimbun" put it very bluntly. It turns out that the United States wants Garcia's trip to promote "the unity of free people in Asia," that is, to piece together a Northeast Asian alliance centered on Japan. And in the eyes of the United States, it is particularly useful for Garcia to undertake this task, because just as the Asian people's old hatred for Japanese militarism has not been dispelled, Garcia, who was "wanted by the Japanese" and "whose country suffered at the hands of the Japanese," can forget the old hatred and run to Japan to talk about the "friendly relations between the Philippines and Japan." In this way, Garcia has set an example, which is conducive to removing "obstacles" for the United States to piece together a Northeast Asian alliance, and so on.

　　However, it has been revealed that Garcia's original purpose in going to Japan was to "bring some economic gains," that is, to get some compensation loans, that's all. However, regardless of Garcia's intentions, Washington is using this to play magic with Garcia.

　　A Pakistani official recently said that he "wants to stand with the West" and does not want to "play with the United States." However, now, the "Garcia-style example" shows that the United States is very good at "playing" people like Garcia who follow the United States.

### 被美国耍弄的“榜样”

    被美国耍弄的“榜样”
    最近菲律宾总统加西亚的“访问”日本，被美国“每日新闻”大吹大捧了一番，说什么这“可能标志着战后世界事务中的一个具有历史意义的转折点”，说什么“树立了加西亚式的榜样”。
    这是怎么一回了不起的大事呢？“每日新闻”说得很露骨。原来，美国要使加西亚此行促进“建立亚洲自由人的团结”，即拼凑以日本为中心的东北亚联盟。而在美国看来，由加西亚担当这个任务特别有用，因为正当亚洲人民对日本军国主义的旧恨未消的时候，曾被“日本人悬赏缉拿”，“他的国家在日本人手里吃了苦头”的加西亚，却能忘却旧恨，跑到日本去大谈其“菲日之间的友好关系”。这样，加西亚就树立了榜样，就有利于替美国拼凑东北亚联盟扫除“障碍”云云。
    但是，据透露，加西亚去日本的目的，原是想“带来一些经济上的收获”，也就是想弄一点赔偿的贷款，如此而已。可是，不管加西亚的打算如何，华盛顿却利用这一点，在加西亚身上耍弄起魔术来了。
    巴基斯坦有一位当政人物最近说，他“要同西方站在一起”，不想“耍弄美国”。可是，现在，“加西亚式的榜样”说明，美国却很会“耍弄”加西亚这一类的追随美国的人。
