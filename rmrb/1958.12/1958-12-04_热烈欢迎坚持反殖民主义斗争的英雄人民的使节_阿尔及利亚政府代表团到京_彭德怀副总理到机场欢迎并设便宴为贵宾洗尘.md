Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Algerian Republic Provisional Government Delegation arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon. In his speech at the airport, Minister Youssef Ben Khedda solemnly stated that the Algerian people would spare no cost in fighting for survival, freedom, and peace.

The friendship envoys from the heroic nation were warmly welcomed at the Capital Airport by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai and other leaders of central state organs. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai expressed that the Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence, and will further strengthen the mutual support between the people of the two countries in the common struggle.

The national flags of China and Algeria and dozens of bright red flags fluttered in the wind at the Capital Airport today. At 4:10 pm, when Minister Youssef Ben Khedda, Minister Mahmoud Cherif, and Director Sha'ad Dahlab slowly stepped off the plane amidst welcoming music, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan, Acting Minister of Foreign Trade Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and others stepped forward to shake hands with the distinguished guests, warmly welcoming the envoys of the heroic people who persist in the anti-colonialist struggle - all the distinguished guests from the first government delegation of the Algerian Republic.

Minister Youssef Ben Khedda and Minister Mahmoud Cherif, accompanied by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, reviewed the guard of honor at the airport. Young Pioneers of the capital presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

At the airport, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, extending the highest respect to the Algerian brothers who are engaged in a heroic struggle. He said that common experiences and common struggles closely link the people of our two countries together. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence. The Chinese people have always regarded your victory as their own victory, and have been greatly encouraged and supported by your victory. The Chinese people are willing to further develop the militant friendship between the people of our two countries, and further strengthen our mutual support in the common struggle.

Vice Premier Peng Dehuai said that the formal establishment of the Algerian Republic marks a major victory in the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation. The Chinese people warmly celebrated the birth of the Algerian Republic, and the Chinese government quickly recognized the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. This has brought the friendship between the people of our two countries into a new stage. Your visit will surely further promote the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people, and will help the friendly cooperation between the people of Asian and African countries.

Minister Youssef Ben Khedda then spoke. He said that the Algerian people are engaged in a heroic struggle against a cruel enemy supported and armed by Western imperialism, and the Algerian people know that the Chinese people are on their side. The Chinese government's recognition of the Algerian people's national government has inspired and encouraged the Algerian people. The friendly ties forged by the people of the two countries in the exciting struggle will be strengthened day by day.

After talking about the Algerian people's consistent and heroic persistence in the anti-colonialist struggle for more than a hundred years, Minister Youssef Ben Khedda said that in the past four years, one in every eighteen Algerians has given his life for the freedom and independence of the motherland. The Algerian people will spare no effort and will continue to spare no effort, because they firmly believe that their own struggle is a struggle for survival, freedom and peace.

Minister Youssef Ben Khedda finally said that the great Chinese people, like the Algerian people, have fought and supported the heroic struggle of the Algerian people. The minister also warmly praised the peaceful construction of the Chinese people in his speech, and hoped that their visit would help strengthen the friendly cooperation between the people of the two countries.
