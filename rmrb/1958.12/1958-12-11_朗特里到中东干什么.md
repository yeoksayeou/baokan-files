What is Rountree Doing in the Middle East?
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree began his trip to the Middle East on the 6th, and he will visit countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, the United Arab Republic, and Iraq. The U.S. State Department said that this is just a normal visit to "understand the situation."

The people of the Middle East are no strangers to who Rountree is.

In July of this year, Egypt's "Al-Ahram" reported that the U.S. State Department sent a secret telegram to its envoys in the Middle East in April, instructing them on how to divide the Arab people and interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. The telegram stated: "Efforts must continue to discredit the idea of ​​establishing a federation between Syria and Egypt, in order to alienate these two countries, because our main goal in this region remains to be the division of Syria and Egypt." "It is necessary to unremittingly consolidate internal forces with Western ideals and external forces that can intervene in possible events within the United Arab Republic at an appropriate time..."

Who was the signatory of this telegram? None other than Rountree, who is now personally conducting activities in the Middle East.

Rountree's choice to visit the Middle East at this time is for a reason. In the face of the surging wave of the national independence movement of the Arab people, the colonial expansion policy of U.S. imperialism in the Near and Middle East has been met with setbacks everywhere. However, the United States is not reconciled. It is doing everything possible to subvert and undermine all Arab countries that insist on implementing independent policies, and is trying its best to divide the nationalist forces of various Arab countries. This is the main intention of Rountree's trip to the Middle East.

However, it seems that Rountree's expedition has not been successful. As soon as he showed up, the Arab people saw through him. Lebanon's "Al Usbu al Arabi" said in an editorial that Rountree's "visit" to the Middle East is aimed at plotting new conspiracies against the Arab people. Damascus's "Al-Nour" pointed out that imperialism is making every effort to undermine the unity of the United Arab Republic and Iraq, and is repeating the old tune of the so-called "communist danger," attempting to weaken the liberation movement in the Arab East. These newspapers also called on the Arab people to remain vigilant and strengthen unity in order to defeat the new conspiracies of imperialism.

Rountree, a plague god of colonialism, has appeared in the Middle East. However, the Middle Eastern people, who are firmly opposed to colonialism, know how to send the plague god away!

    朗特里到中东干什么
    本报评论员
    美国助理国务卿朗特里在6日开始了它的中东之行，他要访问黎巴嫩、约旦、阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克等国。美国国务院说，这不过是一次“了解情况”的平常的访问。
    朗特里是何许人，中东人民并不陌生。
    今年7月，埃及“金字塔报”曾经报道，美国国务院在4月间发给驻中东的使节一份秘密电报，指示他们怎样分化阿拉伯人民和干涉中东各国内政。电报写道：“必须继续不懈地努力使叙利亚和埃及建立联邦的思想信誉扫地，以便离间这两个国家，因为我们在这个地区的主要目标仍然是分裂叙利亚和埃及”。“必须不懈地巩固具有西方理想的内部力量和可以在适当时机干涉阿拉伯联合共和国国内可能发生的事件的国外力量……”。
    这份电报的签署者是谁呢？不是别人，恰恰就是现在亲自到中东来进行活动的朗特里。
    朗特里选择这个时候访问中东，是有缘故的。在阿拉伯人民的民族独立运动汹涌澎湃的浪潮面前，美帝国主义在中近东的殖民扩张政策到处碰壁。然而，美国是不甘心的。它千方百计地想要颠复和破坏一切坚持实行独立政策的阿拉伯国家，极力分化阿拉伯各国的民族主义力量。这就是朗特里中东之行的主要企图。
    但是，看来朗特里是出师不利的。他刚一露头，阿拉伯人民就把他看穿了。黎巴嫩“消息周报”在一篇社论中说：朗特里对中东的“访问”，其目的是策划新的阴谋来反对阿拉伯人民。大马士革“光明报”指出，帝国主义正在不遗余力地企图破坏阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克的团结，重弹所谓“共产主义危险”的老调，企图借此削弱阿拉伯东方的解放运动。这些报纸并且号召阿拉伯人民要保持警惕和加强团结，以击败帝国主义的新阴谋。
    朗特里，一个殖民主义的瘟神，在中东出现了。然而，坚决反对殖民主义的中东人民是懂得怎样把瘟神送走的！
