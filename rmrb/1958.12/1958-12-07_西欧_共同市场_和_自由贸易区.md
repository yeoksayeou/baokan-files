The West European "Common Market" and "Free Trade Area"
	Yang Guang

	On November 14, the Propaganda Minister of the de Gaulle government, Soustelle, formally announced after a cabinet meeting that France considered it impossible to establish a "free trade" area according to the British-proposed approach. At that time, the special committee of the seventeen countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," chaired by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Maudling, was discussing the difficulties encountered in establishing a "free trade area": Britain insisted on its imperial preference system; France and the other five countries participating in the "Common Market" were dissatisfied with the British attempt to benefit both ways—enjoying imperial preferences in the Commonwealth and enjoying the benefits of reduced tariffs and increased import quotas in the future "free trade area" in Western Europe.

	Soustelle's statement was like a bolt from the blue for Britain. All its plans seemed to be falling through. As a result, a chorus of angry denunciations rang out from London.

	The Times, in its November 18 editorial entitled "France the Wrecker," listed France's crimes. It also attacked other "Common Market" countries such as West Germany. The British government even revealed that it would not hesitate to split Western Europe and gather another group of countries from the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" to create an economic organization to confront the "Common Market." British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in the foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons on December 4, spoke on this issue in an even more blatant tone of threat, saying: "I must say very frankly that if the tradition of trusted cooperation in the economic field is broken, I do not see how this tradition of cooperation in the military and political fields can be preserved intact." His words suggested a willingness to burn bridges and cause a great disturbance.

	To ease British dissatisfaction, the de Gaulle government proposed to the other five "Common Market" countries on November 17 that when the "Common Market" countries mutually reduced tariffs and increased import quotas on January 1 next year, they should also relax import quotas for the eleven countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" outside the "Common Market." On December 3, the communiqué issued by the "Common Market" Council of Ministers also announced a temporary measure: the six countries would extend the 10% reduction in tariffs on industrial products (excluding coal and steel) to other members of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the provisions for relaxing import quotas on industrial products would also apply to other members of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau."

	This is a temporary compromise. However, from the quarrel over the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area," we can fully see the irreconcilable, life-and-death economic contradictions between the imperialist countries, who have always sung high-sounding tunes of "unity," "interdependence," and so on.

	The "Common Market," reflecting the contradictions between major capitalist countries in Western Europe such as Britain, France, and West Germany, was established in March 1957 by West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, who signed a treaty in Rome. This treaty came into effect on January 1, 1958, and the provision for reducing tax rates by 10% was to be implemented from January 1, 1959.

	The main feature of the "Common Market" is to ensure the free movement of goods, capital, and labor between the six countries. Geographically, in addition to the member countries' own territories, their overseas colonies are also included. In terms of trade, there are the following provisions: 1. Tariffs will be phased out in twelve to fifteen years. In the first stage (four to six years), tariffs will be reduced by 30%, in the second stage (four years), tariffs will be reduced by another 25% to 30%, and in the third stage (four years), tariffs will be completely eliminated; 2. Import quota systems will be gradually relaxed and eventually completely eliminated between the six countries; 3. A common tariff rate will be implemented for countries outside the "Common Market." In addition, there are various regulations regarding tax legislation, social welfare, prices, and transportation.

	The "Common Market" is an international cartel formed by the monopoly capital of the six continental European countries in order to monopolize the Western European market, reduce competition among internal groups, and strengthen competition with countries outside the "Common Market." It is a product of the highly developed state monopoly capitalism in the second stage of the general crisis of capitalism. It differs from the previously organized coal and steel joint ventures and even more from the international cartels before the war. It is an organization that includes the free flow of industrial and agricultural products, capital, and labor within the six countries. After the establishment of this organization, it will include more than 160 million people in Western Europe and possess 20% of the industrial production capacity of the capitalist world.

	In the "Common Market," as in other international cartels, leadership is always in the hands of the group with the strongest economic strength. Among the six countries participating in the "Common Market," West Germany has the strongest economic power. Let us compare it with France, the second largest country in the "Common Market." West Germany accounts for 42.81% of the industrial production of the six countries, while France accounts for only 26.54% (1956). West Germany's economic development is also the fastest, while France lags far behind West Germany in this regard. West Germany's gold and foreign exchange reserves are also beyond France's reach. Due to equipment upgrades and increased exploitation of workers, the rate of increase in labor productivity in West Germany is also unmatched by other countries in Western Europe. In addition, West Germany has lower wages and poorer social welfare, while France has higher wages and social welfare. The cost of West German goods is lower than that of France and other countries. Therefore, West German goods are very competitive in the world market, and its exports account for the first place in the six-country market. Finally, West Germany is a low-tariff country, with its tariff rates often only 15% of the price of goods, while France is a high-tariff country, with German tariffs often 60% to 70% of the French tax rate.

	The above situation shows that the "Common Market" is most beneficial to West Germany; France, which is in extreme financial and economic difficulty, is naturally no match for West Germany.

	Since this is the case, why are France and the other four countries willing to join forces with West Germany to create a "Common Market"? This is not an accidental event either. First of all, this is because the monopoly capitalists in continental Europe feel the need to unite to resist the expansion of the American economy and further protect the Western European market. From the export trade figures of the "Common Market" countries in 1957, we can see the following percentages: West Germany's total value of goods exported to Western European countries (excluding Britain) accounts for 54% of its total exports, Italy's goods exported to Western European countries account for 45% of its total exports, the Netherlands' goods exported to these regions account for 56% of its export value, Belgium's proportion is 58%, and France is the lowest, also accounting for 36%. In this way, it is not difficult for us to see the importance of the continental European market to the major capitalist countries in Western Europe. Secondly, we should also note that the members of the "Common Market" are all members of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Under the control of the blind anti-socialist camp sentiment, the ruling classes of these countries attempt to take some form of economic alliance to maintain their military alliance.

	However, France's situation is somewhat different. France's colonial market is almost as important as the market on the European continent. France's industry lags behind West Germany's, and it has always been heavily protected by high tariffs and import quota systems. At the same time, it also feels that joining forces with West Germany to form a customs union will inevitably be dominated by West Germany. Therefore, it appeared particularly wavering in the negotiations of the "Common Market" treaty. Initially, it wanted to bring Britain in to check West Germany, but Britain was unwilling to be constrained by the "Common Market" and proposed the "Free Trade Area" proposal. Later, France changed its mind and put forward its own demands and conditions, such as including overseas territories and establishing the "Overseas Territory Development Fund" (i.e., using West German funds to develop colonies and exploit the people there). It is worth mentioning that of the more than 580 million US dollars of the "Development Fund" raised by the six "Common Market" countries, more than 510 million US dollars was allocated to France. After France obtained certain compensation from West Germany, it finally signed the Rome Treaty. However, due to France's financial and economic difficulties, de Gaulle was still unwilling to directly undertake the treaty obligations after taking office, and repeatedly released air, preparing not to reduce tariffs on January 1 next year. As a result, France and West Germany repeatedly conducted negotiations and talks at various levels, bargaining repeatedly.

	The establishment of the West European "Common Market" will be a serious threat to Britain. Therefore, Britain put forward the "Free Trade Area" proposal in response to the "Common Market." The "Free Trade Area" plan includes the six countries participating in the "Common Market" and the eleven countries that have not participated in the "Common Market" (they are all members of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau"). Its main content is that the member countries of the future "Free Trade Area" will take the same steps as the member countries of the "Common Market" to gradually reduce and eliminate tariffs within the region and gradually eliminate import quota systems within the region. However, its differences from the "Common Market" are: 1. The member countries of the "Common Market" must stipulate consistent external tariffs, while the "Free Trade Area" plan stipulates that each participating country can adopt its own external tariff rates; 2. The "Common Market" includes the free flow of industrial and agricultural products, while the "Free Trade Area" only includes industrial products; 3. The "Free Trade Area" does not include the free flow of capital and labor between member countries, but is limited to the buying and selling of goods; 4. The "Common Market" has established a set of institutions such as a Council of Ministers, a joint parliament, and a court, while the organization of the "Free Trade Area" is relatively loose.

	The British proposal was supported by the Nordic countries, Austria, and Switzerland. Since October last year, the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" has established a special committee (chaired by Britain's Maudling) to discuss this issue. The reason why Britain put forward this plan is that the Western European market is also very important to Britain. It is unthinkable that the Western European market would be taken away by West Germany. Therefore, Britain hopes that at least British industrial products can compete with West German industrial products on the Western European market under the same conditions. At the same time, Britain requires that agricultural products not be included in the "Free Trade Area" and that the import tax rates of each member country to countries outside the area do not have to be the same. In this way, Britain may still maintain the imperial preference system. The reason why Britain particularly wants to preserve the imperial preference system is because Britain relies on it to maintain the vast majority of its overseas markets. Of Britain's foreign trade, 45% of exports are to the sterling area, and 37% of imports come from the sterling area. Most of the countries in the sterling area are British colonies or dominions, and Britain enjoys preferential tax rates on trade with these regions under the provisions of the imperial preference system. For example, if the same industrial products from Britain and West Germany are exported to India, the import tax levied by India on British goods is lighter than the tax levied on West German goods. In this way, British goods are more competitive in the Indian market than West German goods, and Britain is in an advantageous position in terms of monopolizing the market. In order to maintain a particularly favorable market for its export goods, Britain also gives reciprocal preferential tax rates to agricultural and mineral products from various Commonwealth member countries. In this way, it is not difficult for us to understand why Britain is unwilling to participate in the "Common Market" and wants to create another "Free Trade Area," and why Britain is unwilling to budge on tax rates and agricultural product issues. Here, France does not quite agree with Britain's approach. The competitiveness of French industry is not as good as that of Britain. For example, the price of French machinery and equipment is on average 15% to 20% higher than the price of West Germany and Britain, and ships are one-third higher. French industrial products do not hope to find a way out in the traditional market of Britain. As the spokesperson of the British bourgeoisie said, what France hopes for is not to expand overseas markets, but to protect its domestic market first. Therefore, France is not very interested in the "Free Trade Area" with free competition only for industrial products. Even if it has to establish a "Free Trade Area" under everyone's pressure, France requires that its agricultural products and the agricultural products of its colonies can be sold to Britain and enjoy preferential tax treatment at the same time. In this way, the dispute between the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area" has become a sharpening of the contradiction between Britain and France. After de Gaulle came to power, the nature of this issue has changed somewhat. What de Gaulle demanded was not the market for French agricultural products, but France's status as a major power, demanding that France be on an equal footing with the United States and Britain in European affairs. According to rumors circulating in Paris, de Gaulle intended to exchange the establishment of the "Free Trade Area" for France's status. However, after French Foreign Minister de Murville went to London for talks and failed to achieve anything, the issue of the "Free Trade Area" became even more difficult to establish according to Britain's ideas.

	However, when we talk about the contradictions between Britain and France in the "Free Trade Area," we should not ignore the contradictions between Britain and West Germany on this issue. According to the situation of economic development, Britain and West Germany are industrial powers in Western Europe, and they are rivals in seizing commodity markets, raw material producing areas, and investment places. At present, they only have a consensus on the "Free Trade Area." That is to say, in addition to dominating "Little Europe," West Germany also hopes to seize more status in markets outside "Little Europe." Therefore, it does not hesitate to let Britain compete in the small circle of Western Europe. In fact, it is attempting to compete with Britain on a larger scale.

	As for Britain, it hopes to maintain its position in Western Europe, but at the same time, it is afraid of West Germany infiltrating its traditional sphere of influence. It is only at present that the contradictions between Britain and West Germany have not been fully developed.

	On the issue of the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area," although Britain and France and other countries have made some temporary compromises, this life-and-death struggle has not ended, and in the future, not only between Britain and France, but also between Britain, France, and West Germany, the contradictions will become more acute. The unity between imperialist countries is temporary, and their contradictions are irreconcilable. This law has been repeatedly proven by history. (Attached picture)

    西欧“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”
    阳光
    11月14日，戴高乐政府的宣传部长苏斯戴尔在开完内阁会议之后正式宣布：法国认为不可能按英国建议的方针路线来建立“自由贸易”。这时，以英国会计大臣莫德林为主席的“欧洲经济合作局”十七个国家的专门委员会正在讨论成立“自由贸易区”所遭遇到的难题：英国坚持自己的帝国优惠制；法国以及参加“共同市场”的其他五个国家不满意英国人两面占便宜——既在英联邦方面享受帝国优惠制，又在西欧方面享受未来的“自由贸易区”的降低关税和提高进口限额的待遇。
    苏斯戴尔的这个声明，对英国说来简直是一个晴天霹雳。它的一切打算眼看要落空了。于是，一片破口大骂之声，从伦敦响了起来。
  “泰晤士报”在11月18日的以“法国破坏者”为题的社论中数开了法国的罪状。对其他的“共同市场”国家如西德都进行了攻击。英国政府甚至透露，它将不惜使西欧分裂，纠集“欧洲经济合作局”的另一批国家，搞一个经济组织来和“共同市场”对抗。英国外交大臣劳埃德12月4日在英国下院的外交辩论中谈到这个问题时更以露骨的威胁口吻说：“我必须十分坦率地说，如果在经济方面的信任的合作传统被打破的话，我看不出在军事和政治方面的这种合作传统怎么能够完整无缺地保存下去。”言下有不惜破釜沉舟，大闹一场的样子。
    为了缓和英国的不满，戴高乐政府在11月17日向“共同市场”其他五个国家提出建议，在明年1月1日“共同市场”各国彼此降低关税和提高进口限额的时候，也把它们对“共同市场”以外的“欧洲经济合作局”的十一个国家的进口限额也放宽。12月3日，“共同市场”部长理事会发表的公报中也宣布了一个临时措施：六国将把对工业产品（煤钢除外）降低关税10％的规定推广到“欧洲经济合作局”和关税贸易总协定的其它成员国，对放宽进口工业产品定额的规定，也将适用于“欧洲经济合作局”其它成员国。
    这是一个暂时的妥协。但是，从关于“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的争吵里，我们已经可以充分看出一向高唱“团结一致”、“互相依赖”等等高调的帝国主义国家之间不可调和的你死我活的经济矛盾。
    反映着英、法、西德等西欧主要资本主义国家间矛盾的“共同市场”，是在1957年3月由西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡等六国在罗马签订条约决定建立的。这个条约已在1958年1月1日生效，而从1959年1月1日便要开始实行降低税率10％的规定。
    “共同市场”的主要特征，是保证商品、资本、劳动力在六国之间的自由移动。在地区上讲，除了成员国的本土外，它们的海外殖民地也包括在内。在贸易方面有这样一些规定：一、十二年到十五年内分阶段取消关税壁垒。第一阶段（四年到六年）降低关税30％，第二阶段（四年）再降低关税25％到30％，第三阶段（四年）完全取消关税；二、六国之间逐步放宽并最后完全取消进口限额制度；三、对“共同市场”以外的国家实行共同关税率。此外，还有关于捐税立法、社会福利、价格及运输方面的种种规定。 
    “共同市场”是欧洲大陆六国垄断资本为独占西欧市场，减少内部各集团的竞争和加强同“共同市场”以外的国家的竞争而成立的国际卡特尔。它是资本主义总危机第二阶段国家垄断主义高度发展下的产物。它不同于以往所组织的煤钢联营，更不同于战前的国际卡特尔，是一种包括工农业产品、资本、劳动力自由在六国范围内流动的组织。这一个组织成立后，将包括西欧一亿六千多万人口，拥有资本主义世界20％的工业生产能力。
    在“共同市场”中，正如其他国际卡特尔一样，领导权总是操在经济实力最雄厚的集团手中。参加“共同市场”六国中，西德的经济力量最强。且把它和“共同市场”的第二大国法国作一对比。西德在六国工业生产中所占的比重是42.81％，而法国只占26.54％（1956年）。西德经济发展的速度也最快，而法国在这方面也大大落后于西德。西德的黄金外汇储备更是法国望尘莫及的。由于设备更新和加强对工人的剥削，西德的劳动生产率的上升速度也是西欧其他国家所比不上的。加上西德工资较低，社会福利较差，而法国工资和社会福利较高，西德商品的成本低于法国和其他国家，因而西德商品在世界市场上的竞争力很强，它在六国市场的输出占第一位。最后，西德是低关税国家，它的关税率往往只有货价的15％，而法国是高关税国家，德国的关税往往为法国货税额的60％到70％。
    上述情况说明“共同市场”对西德最有利；财政经济困难极度严重的法国，自然不是西德的对手。
    既然这样，为什么法国和其它四国又愿意和西德合伙搞“共同市场”呢？这也不是偶然的事件。首先这是由于欧洲大陆上的垄断资本家们感到有联合起来抵御美国经济的扩张，进一步保住西欧的市场的必要。从“共同市场”各国在1957年的出口贸易数字中，我们便可见到这样几个百分比：西德输往西欧各国（不包括英国）商品总值占其出口总值的54％，意大利输往西欧各国的货物占其出口总值的45％，荷兰输往这些地区的商品占其出口额的56％，比利时的比例数则为58％，法国最低，也占36％。这样，我们不难看出欧洲大陆的市场，对西欧各主要资本主义国家的重要性。其次，我们还应注意，“共同市场”的成员都是“北大西洋公约组织”的成员，这些国家的统治阶级在盲目的反对社会主义阵营的情绪的支配下，企图采取某种形式的经济联盟来维系他们的军事联盟。
    但是，法国的处境有些不同。法国的殖民地市场与欧洲大陆上的市场差不多同样重要。法国的工业又落后于西德，并且一向是受到高关税和进口限额制度的重重保护。同时它也感到与西德一道搞关税同盟，必然要受西德的支配。所以，它在“共同市场”的条约的谈判中显得特别摇摆，最初是想把英国拉进去与西德抗衡，可是英国却不愿受“共同市场”的拘束而提出了“自由贸易区”的建议。后来，法国改而提出自己的要求和条件，譬如，把海外的属地包括进去，成立“海外领土开发基金”（即利用西德的资金来开发殖民地，榨取那里的人民）。值得提一提的是“共同市场”六国筹集的五亿八千多万美元的“开发基金”，拨给法国的为五亿一千多万美元。法国从西德方面取得了一定的补偿之后，总算在罗马条约上签了字。可是，由于法国的财政经济困难，戴高乐在上台以后仍不愿直截了当地承担条约义务，一再放出空气，不准备在明年1月1日降低关税。这样一来，法国和西德之间就一再地进行各级的谈判和会谈，多次进行讨价还价。
    西欧“共同市场”的成立，对英国将是一个严重的威胁，因此英国才针对着“共同市场”提出“自由贸易区”的方案。“自由贸易区”计划包括参加“共同市场”的六国和未参加“共同市场”的十一个国家（它们都是“欧洲经济合作局”的成员国）。其主要内容是未来的“自由贸易区”的成员国与“共同市场”的成员国同一步骤，逐步减低和取消区域内的关税并且逐步取消区域内的进口限额制度。但它与“共同市场”相异之点是：一，“共同市场”的成员国必须规定一致的对外关税，而“自由贸易区”的计划则规定，各参加国可以采取各自的对外关税率；二，“共同市场”包括工业品和农产品的自由流动，而“自由贸易区”仅包括工业品；三，“自由贸易区”不包括资本和劳动力在成员国之间自由流动，仅限于商品的买卖；四，“共同市场”设立了部长理事会、共同议会、法院等一套机构，而“自由贸易区”的组织比较松散。
    英国提出的计划得到北欧国家、奥地利、瑞士的支持。从去年10月起，“欧洲经济合作局”成立了一个专门委员会（英国的莫德林当主席）来讨论这个问题。英国之所以提出这个计划，是由于西欧的市场对英国来说也是甚为重要的。西欧市场若给西德抢去是一件不堪设想的事。所以，英国希望至少英国的工业品能在西欧市场上和西德的工业品在同一条件下竞争。同时，英国却要求把农产品不包括在“自由贸易区”之内、各成员国对区外国家的进口税率不必一致。这样英国就可能依旧保持帝国优惠制。英国之所以特别要保存帝国优惠制是因为英国靠它来维持绝大部分的海外市场。英国的对外贸易，出口的45％是输往英镑区，进口的37％来自英镑区，而大部分英镑区的国家是英国的殖民地或自治领，英国对这些地区的贸易在帝国优惠制的规定下享有优惠税率。例如，英国和西德的同样的工业品输往印度，印度对英国商品征课的进口税就比对西德商品课的税轻，这样英国商品在印度市场上的竞争能力比西德强，在垄断市场这一点来说，英国就处于优势地位。英国为了给它的出口商品保持一个特别有利的市场，对那来自各联邦成员国的农、矿产品也给以互惠的优惠税率的待遇。这样，我们就不难理解英国为什么不愿意参加“共同市场”而要另来一个“自由贸易区”，为什么英国在税率和农产品问题上死也不肯让步。在这里，法国就不很同意英国的做法。法国工业的竞争能力比不上英国，例如，法国机器装备的价格平均比西德和英国的价格高15％到20％，船舶高三分之一。法国的工业品并不希望到英国的传统市场上找出路，正如英国资产阶级的代言人所说，法国所希望的并不是扩大海外市场，而是首先要保住它的国内市场，所以法国对单是工业品自由竞争的“自由贸易区”并不感到多大兴趣。即使是在大家的压力下不得不成立“自由贸易区”，法国就要求它和它的殖民地的农产品能销英国去，同时并享受优惠税的待遇。这样一来，“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”之争就变成了英法两国的矛盾的尖锐化了。在戴高乐上台之后，这个问题的性质又有一些改变，戴高乐要求的不是法国农产品的市场，而是法国的大国地位，要求在欧洲事务中法国与美英平起平坐。据巴黎流行的传说，戴高乐意在把“自由贸易区”的建立换取法国的地位。但法国的外交部长德姆维尔去伦敦一谈而不得要领之后，“自由贸易区”的问题就更难按照英国的想法来建立了。
    然而，我们谈论英法在“自由贸易区”上的矛盾时，我们不宜忽视英国和西德在这个问题上的矛盾。按经济发展的情况说，英国和西德是西欧的工业大国，它们在抢夺商品市场、原料产地和投资场所上是劲敌。在目前它们只不过是在“自由贸易区”这一点上有一致的地方而已。就是说，西德除了称霸“小欧洲”外，还希望在“小欧洲”以外的市场上抢到更多的地位，所以它不惜让英国到西欧的小圈子里来竞争。实际上，它是企图在更大的范围内和英国竞争的。
    至于英国，它是希望能保持在西欧的地位，但同时却怕西德渗入它的传统势力范围。只是在目前，英国和西德的矛盾还没有充分发展而已。
    在“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的问题上，目前英国和法国等国虽然已经作了一些暂时的妥协。但是，这场你死我活的斗争并没有结束，而且在未来的日子中，不只在英法之间，并且在英国、法国和西德之间的矛盾还会更加尖锐化。帝国主义国家间的一致是暂时的，它们的矛盾则是难以调和的。这条规律，历史早就一再证明过了。（附图片）
