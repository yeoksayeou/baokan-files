Rapid Transportation of Urban and Rural Materials

    (Report from this newspaper) After the Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi concentrated vehicles to transport raw materials and fuel for iron and steel production, the Pingheng Ferry Transfer Station, jointly established by Jingxi, Mubi, and Debao counties, once accumulated over 700 tons of materials awaiting shipment. Later, through the efforts of the cadres at this station, not only was this batch of materials completely transported, but also the means of production and daily necessities transported from Nanning to these three counties, as well as various agricultural and sideline products transported from these three counties to Nanning, flowed smoothly without obstruction. Their main measures were as follows:

    1. Cooperate with all parties and utilize return vehicles. For example, cooperate with the iron and steel logistics department to use return vehicles transporting iron and steel equipment to load commodities. In October, when transportation capacity was at its tightest, this method was used to transport 269 tons of commodities from Jingxi, 103 tons from Mubi, and more than 30 tons from Debao. In addition, maintain close contact with transportation departments, providing them with monthly and ten-day transportation plans so they are aware of the situation and can fill any gaps with the station's commodities.

    2. Proactively find loading and unloading forces to achieve fast loading, unloading, and transportation. In the past, the station was afraid that loading and unloading would take too long, affecting support for iron and steel production, and was unwilling to undertake the transport. The station proactively contacted nearby water conservancy work teams, agricultural technology schools, and other units in advance to ask for their support. This way, with labor available, they could achieve fast loading and transportation.

    3. Organize the recycling and reuse of packaging materials, sending people to various stores to collect packaging tools, solving the past problem of no packaging, making transportation departments unwilling to transport, and goods unable to be shipped out.

    4. Achieve direct transportation for bulk commodities (such as chemical fertilizers and salt). Jingxi, Mubi, and Debao counties jointly arranged all stores in order. Stores with direct road access for trucks were directly supplied, and stores without direct access were supplied by nearby stores that did not involve backflow. (Picture attached)

    城乡物资快运转
    本报讯  广西僮族自治区自车辆集中运输钢铁生产原料及燃料后，靖西、睦边、德保三县联合设立的平恒渡口转运站，曾一度积压下来七百多吨的物资待运。后来在这个站干部的努力下，不但使这批物资全部运完，而且由南宁运往这三个县的生产、生活资料及这三个县运往南宁的各种农副产品，也畅行无阻。他们主要是采取了以下几种作法：
    一、与各方协作，利用回空车辆。如与钢铁后勤部协作，利用运输钢铁器材的回空车辆装载商品。在10月份运力最紧张的时候，用这个办法，靖西运出商品二百六十九吨，睦边一百零三吨，德保三十多吨。此外，密切与交通部门联系，按月按旬向承运部门提供运输计划，让他们心中有数，遇有空隙，就将该站的商品补上去。
    二、主动找好装、卸力量，做到装、卸、运三快。过去车站怕装卸耽搁时间太长，影响支援钢铁生产，不肯承运，这个站便事先主动向附近水利工作队、农技学校等单位联系，请他们支援；这样有了劳动力，就能快装、快运。
    三、组织包装用具回收回用，派人到各商店收回包装工具，解决了过去没有包装，承运部门不肯承运，有货运不出的困难。
    四、大宗商品（如化肥、食盐等）做到直线运输。靖西、睦边、德保三县联合将所有的商店排队，有公路直通汽车的商店，就直运到店，不能直运的商店，就由附近不倒流的商店供应各商店。（附图片）
