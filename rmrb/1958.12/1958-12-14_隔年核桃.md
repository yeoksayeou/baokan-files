    "Two-Year Walnut"
    Peach three, apricot four, pear five in years,
    No son, no planting a walnut orchard appears,
    These are old concepts of the past,
    Now bearing fruit in just two years at last.
    Note: There is a kind of "two-year walnut" in Shaanxi and other places that can bear fruit in two years.

    “隔年核桃”
    桃三杏四梨五年，
    无儿不种核桃园，
    这是过去老观念，
    如今结果只两年。
    注：陕西等地有一种“隔年核桃”两年可结果。
