    Little Author
  Don't underestimate the little author,
  But there are many poems,
  Wholeheartedly surpassing Du Fu's poems,
  Quickly catching up with Guo Lao.

    Thanks to Our Chairman Mao
  Tractors are used for plowing,
  Telephones are installed in the village,
  Electric fans are used in the canteen,
  Radios are installed in the homes.
  Want to know where these come from?
  Thanks to our Chairman Mao.

    Great Harvest
  The commune has a great harvest this year,
  Grain piles reach the sky,
  The sun almost couldn't pass,
  The plane had to make a detour.

  Mom Praises the Canteen
  Magpies chirp,
  Mom always smiles.
  What is she smiling at? I know:
  The commune's establishment brings happiness,
  Coming back from the fields to the canteen,
  No longer busy cooking meals.

    Enough for the Sun to Shine for Days
  The commune has thousands upon thousands of members,
  Many people are powerful, surpassing the sky,
  Each person sheds a drop of sweat,
  Enough for the sun to shine for days.

    Red Stone Mountain
  Looking from afar, Mengyao is a red expanse,
  A red stone mountain appears in the village,
  Passersby all come to see,
  It turns out to be a mountain piled up with red dates.

    Thousands of Miles of Red Brightness
  Small iron stoves,
  Thousands upon thousands,
  Go to the top of the mountain to take a look,
  Thousands of miles of red brightness.

    Ten Thousand Axes Smash the Mountain
  A small axe weighs half a kilogram,
  Smashing rocks resounds through the sky,
  Although the axe is small, it has great power,
  Ten thousand axes smash the mountain. (Worker-Peasant Middle School Wang Shimou)

  Who Dares to Invade
  Everyone refines iron,
  Refining iron and steel mountains,
  Who dares to invade,
  Throw them into the furnace!

    Grandpa Strokes His Beard and Laughs
  Old grandpa, seventy-three,
  Slowly walks into the House of Happiness.
  Upon entering the gate, he looks inside,
  Snow-white houses dazzle the eyes.
  Grandpa strokes his beard and laughs,
  Nodding his head towards Beijing.

    Resting and Still Reading
  Tens of millions of little children's songs,
  A large expanse working in the fields,
  Work is done quickly and well,
  Resting and still reading.

    Electric Loudspeaker
  Electric loudspeaker, wa wa wa,
  No mouth, but can speak,
  Listening to good news from Beijing,
   We have also learned Mandarin Chinese.

    多亏咱们毛主席

  多亏咱们毛主席。
