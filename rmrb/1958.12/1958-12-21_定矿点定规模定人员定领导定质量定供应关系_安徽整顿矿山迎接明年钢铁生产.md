Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th – In order to stockpile sufficient ore to meet next year's steel production tasks, mines in various parts of Anhui Province are vigorously carrying out rectification, improvement, and consolidation work.

Since the start of the Great Leap Forward in steel production, Anhui quickly launched a mass movement to report and mine mineral deposits throughout the province, identifying hundreds of mining locations. Among these, there are ninety-seven iron ore locations alone. These mines are mostly distributed in the mountainous areas of southern Anhui. Except for Ma'anshan and Tongguanshan, which use mechanized mining, most of the rest rely on indigenous methods of extraction. Relying on these combined native and foreign extraction methods, Anhui Province has mined 5.95 million tons of iron ore to date, an increase of more than seven times compared to the total mining volume of last year. This has not only guaranteed the needs of the province's Great Leap Forward in the steel industry but has also supported the steel industries of Anshan, Shijingshan, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Tianjin, and other places.

The vast majority of mines in Anhui Province only started production successively after the Great Leap Forward in steel production began in July of this year. Due to the urgency of the task and the short amount of time, hasty mining occurred. The geological exploration work of many mines was relatively crude, there was no time for design, management organizations were unsound, and transportation was difficult. In order to better complete the current production tasks and lay a good foundation for next year's steel production, mines in various regions are taking "six fixes" measures to vigorously rectify and improve. The main contents of the "six fixes" are: First, fix mining locations. Mines with large ore reserves, high ore grade, and convenient transportation, as proven by geological exploration, should be expanded and mined in large quantities; those with small reserves but exposed and good grade should maintain production and be mined as much as possible; mines with small reserves and low grade can be abandoned after a certain degree of mining to avoid wasting labor. Second, determine the scale. After the mining location is determined, a short-term and long-term plan and overall deployment should be made for the mine according to the resources and conditions necessary for mining (transportation, electricity, etc.), and the production scale of the mine should be determined. Third, assign personnel. The number of mine leaders and production workers must be determined according to the mine's scale to avoid overstaffing or labor shortages. This is conducive to improving the management level and labor efficiency of enterprise personnel. Fourth, appoint leaders. The mine's own leaders, such as the mine manager, party secretary, and heads of functional departments, must be determined. In addition, it must also be determined which mines are led by the people's commune, which mines are led by the county or special district, and which mines are directly led by the iron and steel joint enterprise. Fifth, ensure quality. Increase necessary testing equipment to ensure a certain grade of ore and avoid affecting the stability of the furnace conditions. Sixth, define supply relationships. Gradually fix the supply relationship between ore and steel plants to reduce changes in ore supply and facilitate production control. At the same time, direct contact between supply and demand sides facilitates mutual assistance and support. In addition, it is also required that while carrying out the "six fixes," various regions establish some necessary management systems for the mines themselves, such as formulating production plans, various quotas, mining regulations, safety systems, raw material receipt, issue, and storage systems, shift handover systems, financial management systems, and inspection and testing systems.

In order to ensure the completion of next year's production tasks, relevant leading departments in Anhui Province also require various regions to do a good job in the exploration of new mines, ensuring that general surveys and exploration work are given equal importance next year; to do a good job in mine design, and to cultivate construction forces as early as possible; and to hold mining geology training classes to cultivate technical personnel who master technologies such as drilling, blasting, winching, and water pumping.

### 定矿点定规模定人员定领导定质量定供应关系  安徽整顿矿山迎接明年钢铁生产

    定矿点定规模定人员定领导定质量定供应关系
    安徽整顿矿山迎接明年钢铁生产
    新华社合肥20日电  为储备足够矿石迎接明年的钢铁生产任务，安徽省各地矿山正在大力进行整顿提高和巩固工作。
    大办钢铁开始以后，安徽在全省范围内即迅速掀起了一个群众性的报矿、采矿运动，找出各种矿点数百处。其中仅铁矿点就有九十七处。这些矿山大部分分布在皖南山区，其中除马鞍山、铜官山是采用机械化开采的以外，其余大部分都是依靠土法开采的。安徽省依靠这些土洋结合的开采方法，到目前止已经开采了铁矿石五百九十五万吨，比去年全年开采量增加了七倍多，不仅保证了全省钢铁工业大跃进的需要，还支援了鞍山、石景山、重庆、太原、天津等地钢铁工业。
    安徽省各地矿山绝大部分是今年7月份大办钢铁以后才陆续投入生产的。由于当时任务急、时间短，仓促开采，不少矿山地质勘探工作比较粗糙，没有来得及设计，管理机构不健全，运输困难。为了更好地完成当前生产任务，并且为明年钢铁生产打好基础，各地矿山正在采取“六定”措施，加以大力整顿和提高。“六定”的主要内容是：第一，定矿点。经过地质勘探证明矿石储量较大、矿石品位高，同时交通方便的矿山，要进行扩建，大量开采；储量虽然不大，但是已露头和品位较好的，应维持生产，尽量采完；储量不多，品位又低的矿山，在开采到一定程度后可以放弃不开，以免浪费劳动力。第二，定规模。矿点定下来以后，要根据资源及矿山开采应具备的条件（交通、电力等），对矿山作出近期、远期的规划和总体部署，确定矿山的生产规模。第三，定人员，矿山领导干部和生产工人，必须按照矿山规模确定定额，以免发生人浮于事或人手短少的现象。这样做有利于提高企业人员的管理水平和劳动效率。第四，定领导。矿山本身的领导干部，如矿长、党委书记以及职能科股长干部，要定下来；另外，哪些矿山归人民公社领导，哪些矿山归县或专区领导，哪些矿山归钢铁联合企业直接领导，也要一一确定下来。第五，定质量。增设必要的检验设备，保证矿石的一定品位，避免影响炉况的稳定。第六，定供应关系。把矿石和钢铁厂的供应关系逐步固定下来，减少矿石供应的变化，便于掌握生产。同时供求双方直接联系，便于互相帮助和支援，此外，还要求各地在进行“六定”的同时，对矿山本身建立一些必要的管理制度，如制定生产计划，各种定额，采矿规程，安全制度，原材料领发和保管制度，交接班制度，财务管理制度，检验化验制度等。
    为保证完成明年生产任务，安徽省有关领导部门还要求各地做好新矿的勘探工作，保证在明年做到普查同勘探工作并重；做好矿山设计，并且要及早培养施工力量；举办采矿地质训练班，培养掌握打眼、放炮、卷扬、水泵等技术的人材。
