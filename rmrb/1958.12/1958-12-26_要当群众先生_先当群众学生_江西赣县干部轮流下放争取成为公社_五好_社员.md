To Be a Teacher of the Masses, First Be a Student of the Masses
Cadres in Ganxian County, Jiangxi, Rotate Downward to Strive to Become "Five-Good" Commune Members

    (Our report) The Ganxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has organized cadres from the County Party Secretary to the commune production team branch secretaries and team leaders, to rotate downward to become "Five-Good" commune members. Through laboring and living with the commune members, the cadres can be both "officials" and "civilians," constantly improving their thinking and work style. At the same time, they frequently listen to the opinions and requests of the commune members regarding the commune, and conscientiously implement the mass line in running the commune.

    This measure was determined by the Ganxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after studying how to improve and strengthen the leadership of the communes. Over the past year, through rectification, cadres at all levels in the county have universally cultivated experimental plots, participating in production to lead production, further improving their work style, and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. However, some cadres still tend to see themselves as cadres, different from the masses. Therefore, in addition to discussing and arranging work with the masses, they rarely interact with them or have heart-to-heart talks. Moreover, the communes have just been established, and it is a new production organization, so cadres still lack leadership experience in all aspects. In view of this situation, the County Party Committee decided to make the rotation of cadres downward to become "Five-Good" commune members a regular system. All levels of cadres in the county are divided into four batches each year to rotate to the communes as commune members. Each batch spends one to three months. In the commune, they completely obey the leadership of the production team and group as ordinary commune members, eating, living, and laboring with the commune members, and striving to become "Five-Good" commune members with good ideology, good labor, good work, good study, and good unity. At the same time, they must also frequently listen to and reflect to the commune the opinions and requests of the masses, assist the team and group cadres in studying and improving leadership work, and explore and summarize the experience of running the commune.

    On November 8, sixty-eight people, led by Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee Liu Pinjing, including commune party secretaries, heads of communes, and production team branch secretaries and team leaders, went down to become the first batch of commune members. For more than a month, through laboring and living with the commune members, not only has the connection between their thoughts and feelings and the masses been closer, and they can often hear the opinions and requests of the masses, but they have also become clearer about some of the problems existing in the work of running the commune, and have timely provided them to the leadership for research and resolution. After County Party Committee Deputy Secretary Liu Pinjing went to Zhukeng Team of the Red Flag People's Commune, he pulled water wheels and planted rapeseed with the commune members and served as a cook in the public canteen. He personally experienced and understood the three demands of the commune members for the commune: one is to run the public canteen well, not only to eat enough, but also to eat well; one is to run nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly well, and to take better care of children and the elderly; one is that there is little pocket money now, and some pocket money is needed. Liu Pinjing reflected these requirements to the commune Party committee and assisted the Party committee in studying and taking measures to rectify collective welfare work. At the same time, labor was reasonably arranged, and 10% of the people were transferred to form a sideline production team to engage in sideline production on a large scale, increasing cash income, so that commune members had pocket money. The commune members were very satisfied. They said, "Secretary Liu is really a good commune member and a good cadre." Pan Yirong, secretary and head of the "May 1st" Commune Party Committee, used to be criticized by commune members for putting on airs as a cadre and rarely interacting with the masses. He only gave a few words when arranging work and considered it done. After becoming a commune member in Jiaolin Production Team this time, he realized more deeply that as a people's cadre, he must discuss everything with the masses and listen to their opinions humbly in order to do a good job and satisfy the masses. For example, many commune members initially resisted the land deep plowing task assigned by the commune, saying that it took a lot of labor and had little effect. After Pan Yirong discussed it with the production team leader, he felt that simply pressing the task was not feasible. He convened a field symposium to patiently explain the benefits of deep plowing to the commune members, and led the way in deep plowing in the field, setting an example. In this way, the deep plowing movement was rapidly launched throughout the team. Daying Production Team of Jinxing Commune was originally a backward team in this commune. After Peng Dalun, the second secretary of the commune Party committee, went to the team, he found in the labor that the production was backward mainly due to the relatively chaotic labor organization. Peng Dalun suggested to the production team to adjust and improve the labor organization. Therefore, in the rush to winter planting, the labor potential of the whole team was fully utilized, and the winter planting task was completed in only five days, becoming the upstream team of the whole commune in winter planting.

    要当群众先生  先当群众学生
    江西赣县干部轮流下放争取成为公社“五好”社员
    本报讯  中共江西省赣县县委组织从县委书记到公社生产队支部书记、队长以上的干部，轮流下放当“五好”社员。通过与社员同劳动、同生活，使干部做到能“官”亦能“民”，不断改进思想和工作作风；同时，经常听取社员对公社的意见和要求，在办社中认真贯彻群众路线的方针。
    这项措施，是中共赣县县委在研究了如何改进和加强对公社的领导问题以后确定的。一年来，经过整风，该县各级干部普遍种了试验田，以参加生产领导生产，进一步改进了工作作风，密切了干群关系。但是，部分干部在思想上还总把自己看成是当干部的，与群众不同，因此，除同群众讨论及布置工作外，平时很少跟群众交往、谈知心话。加之，公社刚刚建立，又是一套新的生产组织，干部在各方面都还缺乏领导经验。鉴于这种情况，县委决定把干部轮流下放当“五好”社员做为一个经常性的制度。将全县各级干部每年分成四批轮流到公社当社员，每批时间是一个月至三个月，在公社里完全以一个普通社员的身份服从生产队、组的领导，与社员同吃同住同劳动，并争取成为思想好、劳动好、工作好、学习好、团结好的“五好”社员。与此同时，还必须经常听取和向公社反映群众对公社的意见和要求，协助队、组干部研究改进领导工作，摸索和总结办公社的经验。
    11月8日，以县委副书记刘品经为首的六十八名公社党委书记、社长及生产队支部书记、队长，已经下去当第一批社员。一个多月来，他们通过与社员同劳动、同生活，不仅思想感情上与群众的联系密切了，能经常的听到群众的意见和要求，同时也由此更清楚地感到和看到了办社工作中所存在的一些问题，及时提供给领导进行研究解决。县委副书记刘品经下到红旗人民公社珠坑队后，同社员一起车水、种油菜和担任了公共食堂的炊事员。他亲身体会和了解到当前社员们对公社的三个要求：一个是办好公共食堂，不仅吃得饱，还要吃得好；一个是办好托儿所、幼儿园和敬老院，对小孩、老人照顾更周到；一个是现在零花钱少，要求有些零钱用。刘品经把这些要求反映给公社党委会，并协助党委会研究和采取了措施，对集体福利工作进行了整顿。同时，合理安排了劳动力，抽调出10％的人组成副业生产队，大搞副业，增加现金收入，使社员有了零花钱。社员们非常满意。他们说：“刘书记真是个好社员，又是个好干部。”“五一”公社党委书记、社长潘亦荣，过去社员反映他摆干部架子，很少与群众交往，布置工作也只是三言两语，说了就算。这次到蕉林生产队当社员之后，才更深刻地体会到作为一个人民的干部必须事事和群众商量，虚心听取群众的意见，才能做好工作，群众满意。例如，公社布置的土地深翻任务，许多社员开始有抵触，说花工多、作用不大；潘亦荣与生产队长研究后，认为光压任务是不行的，便一方面召开田头座谈会，耐心地向社员讲解深耕的好处，一方面带头下田深耕，作出榜样。这样，使全队迅速开展起了深耕运动。金星公社大营生产队原来是这个社的落后队，公社党委第二书记彭大伦到该队以后，在劳动中，发现生产落后主要是由于劳动组织比较混乱。彭大伦向生产队建议调整和健全了劳动组织，因此在突击冬种中，全队劳动潜力得到了充分发挥，仅五天就全部完成了冬种任务，一跃而成为了全社冬种的上游队。
