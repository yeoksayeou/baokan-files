    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 5th. The newly established Revolutionary Museum in Yan'an, the sacred site of the revolution, has recently officially opened.
    The Yan'an Revolutionary Museum is located at the foot of Phoenix Mountain in Yan'an city. Before its establishment, the staff of the museum traveled all over northern Shaanxi, collecting more than 25,000 pieces of revolutionary cultural relics, completing the preparation task one month ahead of schedule.
    The museum displays revolutionary historical relics from the eve of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party to the founding of the People's Republic of China. From these exhibits, it can be seen how the Party Central Committee, in such difficult circumstances, led the people to work hard and persevere in the revolutionary struggle, thereby overthrowing the rule of the three great enemies and establishing the great people's power.

    延安革命博物馆正式开放
    新华社延安5日电  革命圣地延安新成立的一所革命博物馆最近正式开放。
    延安革命博物馆设在延安城内凤凰山麓。成立之前，全馆工作人员跑遍了陕北各地，征集了两万五千多件革命文物，提前一个月完成了筹备任务。
    博物馆里陈列着从中国共产党诞生前夜，到中华人民共和国成立的革命历史文物。从这些陈列品中可以看出，党中央当时是在如何困难的情况下，领导人民艰苦奋斗，坚持了革命斗争，从而推翻了三大敌人的统治，建立了伟大的人民政权。
