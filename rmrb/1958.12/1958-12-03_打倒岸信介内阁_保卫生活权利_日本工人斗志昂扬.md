Xinhua News Agency, December 1st, Tokyo dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a meeting of its Standing Committee in Tokyo today and finalized a draft of its spring struggle policy with the main objectives of demanding higher wages, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's re-submission of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill," abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

According to this plan, Sohyo will vigorously highlight the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and, at the height of the struggle, organize large-scale and powerful strikes in order to achieve the proposed goals.

To this end, Sohyo is preparing to organize struggles by industrial system, adopting the method of confrontation between all workers and all capitalists. Starting around January 20th next year, it will prepare to launch struggles in major regions across the country, and then repeatedly conduct strength struggles to gradually push the struggle to a climax.

The meeting believed that in order to realize the demands put forward by Sohyo in the face of the increasingly serious economic crisis, industrial workers must launch joint struggles, rather than relying on workers from a single enterprise.

The meeting decided that when launching the struggle to demand the immediate establishment of a minimum wage system, oppose unemployment, and demand full employment, it is also necessary to prepare to unite with workers in small and medium-sized enterprises and casual workers to carry out the struggle.

The meeting decided to hold a "National Grand March to Defend Life, Rights and Peace and Oppose Unemployment" in late February next year, and to concentrate the strength of the Public Corporation Workers' Council and all private industry unions during the period from late February to early March as the climax of the struggle, in order to realize the workers' demands.

Sohyo decided to further strengthen the forces of the National Conference Against the Malicious Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law." In order to oppose the United States using Japan, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to establish a military aggression system, and in order to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Sohyo demanded that this National Conference be developed into the "National Conference to Defend Democracy and Peace."

This draft struggle policy will be submitted to the Standing Committee meeting scheduled for the 3rd for study and formal decision.

Xinhua News Agency, December 1st, Tokyo dispatch: Public corporation unions such as the Japan National Railway Workers' Union have decided to take joint action on December 10th and 11th to demand wage increases and the immediate payment of year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' wages to workers. These unions issued instructions for the struggle to their respective unions today.

The National Railway Workers' Union has selected thirty-two stations, passenger and freight areas, etc. across the country and is preparing to hold workplace rallies lasting two to three hours during working hours on the 10th and 11th.

The National Railway Locomotive Workers' Union has also decided to hold workplace rallies lasting two hours during working hours at twenty-seven locations across the country on these two days. The National Railway Locomotive Workers' Union recently submitted demands to the authorities for the payment of year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' wages, wage increases for all workers, and the revocation of illegal punishments against workers.

Employees of the All-Communication Workers' Union have already started their struggle at 168 major post offices across the country starting today. The Central Struggle Committee meeting held by the union today selected 180 post offices and railway post offices, etc., and is preparing to hold workplace rallies lasting two to three hours during working hours on the 10th and 11th. The union demands that the authorities pay workers year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' wages, restore collective bargaining, and pay year-end busy season allowances.

The National Electric Communication Workers' Union has also made a decision to participate in this struggle.

The Sumitomo Metal Industries Company Union, which is demanding that the company pay workers year-end bonuses of 50,000 yen, has decided to hold indefinite strikes at its factories in Osaka, Amagasaki, and Wakayama starting tomorrow because the company refuses to meet the workers' demands.

The Teikoku Chemical Company Union has already started a twenty-four-hour strike at its factories in Taisho Ward, Osaka City, and Saidaiji, Okayama Prefecture, etc., starting this morning. The union is demanding that the company pay each worker a year-end bonus of 26,400 yen, but the company refuses to meet their demands.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Teachers' Union held a national representative meeting in Maebashi City on the 1st and decided to launch the fifth wave of national united struggles in December to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's forced implementation of the "Performance Evaluation" system and illegal suppression of teachers.

The meeting decided that Japanese teachers will also launch a large-scale struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government authorities in February and March next year to cooperate with the spring struggle of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan. The methods of carrying out this struggle, etc., will be determined by a meeting of the Central Committee to be held in mid-January next year.

The struggle policy submitted by the Japan Teachers' Union executive body to the representative meeting stipulates that in order to cooperate with Sohyo's sixth united struggle, Japanese teachers will launch a national united struggle around December 10th to prevent the implementation of the "Performance Evaluation" system and oppose illegal suppression. On this day, all teachers will take leave in the afternoon and hold large-scale rallies respectively. In mid-December, teachers will also launch a struggle against the government and education committees by refusing to take shifts and going to and leaving work on time.

The Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union's struggle committee meeting held on the evening of November 30th decided to launch a strength struggle again from February to March next year, including leave-taking struggles, to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Performance Evaluation" system. This struggle policy will be submitted to the extraordinary meeting scheduled for December 27th for discussion.

The meeting also decided that it is currently necessary to demand collective bargaining with the Wakayama Prefectural Board of Education and demand that the authorities revoke the illegal punishments against teachers. In addition, they will file an administrative appeal requesting the revocation of administrative punishments in the near future and make every effort to launch a court battle.

The Socialist Party held a Central Executive Committee meeting in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 1st and decided to pursue the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government in the regular session of the Diet regarding the dismissal of eight leading cadres of the Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union due to their opposition to the "Performance Evaluation" system and other issues.

    总评确定以反对岸内阁反动政策为主要目标的春季斗争方针方案
    铁道、全递信和电气通信等工会决定采取联合行动展开年终斗争
    教职员工会决定举行第五次全国联合斗争反对“勤务评定”制度
    新华社1日讯  东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天在东京举行的常任干事会会议上，确定了以要求提高工资、反对岸信介政府再次提出“警察官职务执行法修正案”、废除日美“安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁等为主要斗争目标的明年春季斗争方针的方案。
    按照这个方案，“总评”将强有力地突出打倒岸信介内阁的斗争，在斗争高潮中，组织规模宏大、声势浩大的罢工，以便实现提出的斗争目标。
    为此，“总评”准备按工业系统组织斗争，采取由所有工人同所有资本家对抗的方式，从明年1月20日前后起在全国各主要地区做好展开斗争的准备工作，然后反复进行实力斗争，逐步把斗争推向高潮。
    会议认为，为了在经济危机日益严重的情况下实现“总评”所提出的要求，必须由工业部门的工人展开联合斗争，而不能只靠一个企业的工人来进行斗争。
    会议决定，在展开要求立即建立最低工资制、反对失业、要求完全就业的斗争的时候，还要准备同中小企业的工人和散工等联合起来进行斗争。
    会议决定在明年2月下旬举行“保卫生活、权利与和平和反对失业国民大游行”，而以2月下旬到3月上旬这一期间为斗争的高潮，要集中公共企业工会协议会和所有私营产业工会的力量，以便实现工人的要求。
    “总评”决定要进一步加强反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议的力量。为了反对美国利用日本、李承晚集团、蒋介石集团建立军事侵略体系，为了废除日美“安全条约”，“总评”要求把这个国民会议发展成为“保卫民主与和平国民会议”。
    这项斗争方针方案将提交预定于3日举行的干事会会议研究以后作出正式决定。
  新华社1日讯  东京消息：日本国营铁道工会等公共企业工会决定在12月10日和11日两天采取联合行动，要求增加工资和立即发给工人相当于两个月工资的年终津贴。这些工会今天分别向所属工会发出了斗争的指示。

    国营铁道机车工会也决定在这两天在全国二十七个地方在工作时间内举行两小时的工作场所大会。国营铁道机车工会不久以前曾经向当局提出发给相当于两个月工资的年终津贴、全体工人都增加工资和撤销对工人的非法处分等要求。
    全递信从业员工会的职工从今天起已经在全国一百六十八个主要的邮局开始斗争。这个工会今天举行的中央斗争委员会会议选定了一百八十个邮局和铁路邮局等，准备在10日和11日在工作时间内举行两小时到三小时的工作场所大会。这个工会要求当局发给工人相当于两个月工资的年终津贴、恢复集体谈判和发给年终繁忙津贴。
    全国电气通信工会也作出了参加这一斗争的决定。
    正在要求资方发给工人五万日元年终津贴的住友金属工业公司工会，由于资方不肯满足工人的要求，已决定从明天起在大阪、尼崎、和歌山三处工厂举行不定期限的罢工。
    帝国化工公司工会已经从今天早晨起在大阪市大正区工厂、冈山县西大寺等处的工厂开始了二十四小时罢工。工会方面要求资方发给每个工人年终津贴二万六千四百日元，但是资方不肯满足他们的要求。
    新华社2日讯  东京消息：日本教职员工会1日在前桥市举行了全国代表会议，决定在12月举行第五次波浪式的全国联合斗争，反对岸信介政府强制推行“勤务评定”制度和非法镇压教职员。
    会议决定，日本教职员还要在明年2月和3月展开大规模的同岸信介政府当局对抗的斗争，来配合日本工会总评议会的春季斗争。关于进行这一斗争的方法等问题，将由中央委员会在明年1月中旬举行的会议来确定。
    日本教职员工会执行机构向代表会议提出的斗争方针规定，为了配合“总评”的第六次联合斗争，日本教职员将在12月10日前后展开阻止实行“勤务评定”制度、反对非法镇压的全国联合斗争，全体教职员将在这一天的下午全体请假，分别举行大规模的集会；12月中旬，教职员们还要对政府和教育委员会展开拒绝值班、按时上下班的斗争。
    和歌山县教职员工会11月30日晚上举行的斗争委员会会议决定，要从明年2月到3月再次展开包括请假斗争在内的实力斗争，来反对岸信介政府的“勤务评定”制度。这个斗争方针将提交预定在12月27日举行的临时大会讨论。
    会议还决定，当前需要要求同和歌山县教育委员会举行集体谈判，要求当局撤销对教职员的非法处分；此外还要在最近提出要求撤销行政处分的行政控诉，竭尽全力展开法庭斗争。
    社会党1日下午在东京举行中央执行委员会会议，决定要就和歌山县教职员工会的八个领导干部由于反对“勤务评定”制度等问题而被免职的问题，在国会平时会议上追究岸信介政府的责任。
