Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 25th: In order to adapt to the great leap forward in agricultural production and accelerate the development of agricultural meteorological work, the Central Meteorological Bureau and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences recently jointly convened a National Agricultural Meteorology Conference in Nanjing, to make meteorological preparations for ensuring large-scale high yields in the future. A total of 282 representatives from meteorological departments, agricultural scientific research departments, and relevant universities and colleges from various provinces (regions) and cities attended the conference.

Through free discussion and debate, the conference further clarified that agricultural meteorological work must serve production, and agricultural meteorological workers must be good pioneers of agricultural production. The conference criticized the erroneous tendencies of some agricultural meteorological workers who engaged in research for the sake of research, observation for the sake of observation, and were detached from production practice, neglecting results. Some people, deeply imbued with bourgeois individualism, even kept research data and results for themselves. The conference believes that agricultural meteorological work, including experimental research, must be closely integrated with production, and all data and work results should be used as they are produced and promptly promoted to production, so that they can play a role in agricultural production as soon as possible. The representatives cited many vivid facts to illustrate that as long as agricultural meteorological work relies on Party organizations and the masses and proceeds from the needs of production, it can develop rapidly. The conference also made it clear that agricultural meteorological work must go further ahead of agricultural production in order to truly be good pioneers of agricultural production.

The conference representatives exposed and criticized superstitious views, mystification, and passive waiting in agricultural meteorological work. These ideas were concentrated in views on agricultural meteorological experimental research and agricultural meteorological forecasting. For example, some people believe that agricultural meteorology is a new science, and without experts, college students, and complete sets of precision instruments, experimental research cannot be carried out. Others mystified agricultural meteorological forecasting, believing that without precise agricultural meteorological indicators and years of data, forecasting cannot be done.

In order to dispel superstitions with a large number of facts and exchange experiences, the conference specially held an exhibition and introduced typical experiences; through a series of activities, everyone realized that agricultural meteorological experimental research can also be carried out using indigenous instruments; agricultural meteorological forecasting is not mysterious. Of course, it is also necessary for meteorological (weather) stations to carry out some more systematic and formal agricultural meteorological observations and appraisals. Because the development of supplementary revised forecasts has improved the accuracy rate of China's 24-hour and disastrous weather forecasts by more than 10% compared to the original. The observers at these stations and sentry posts are not college students or experts; they have achieved such amazing results only because they put politics in command, dispelled superstitions, worked hard, and humbly learned from the masses. The Daba Township Agricultural Meteorology Sentry in Xianfeng County, Hubei Province, began to make supplementary revised forecasts in September this year. By October 4, they had made 19 forecasts, 16 of which were completely correct, and the remaining three were basically correct, with an average accuracy rate of 94.1%. Under the influence and guidance of this sentry post, 21 meteorological groups have also begun to make supplementary revised forecasts. The Manan Agricultural Meteorology Sentry in Yangjiang County, Guangdong, not only achieved an accuracy rate of 97.3% for the supplementary revised forecasts it made, but also made agricultural meteorological forecasts, which played a good role in local agricultural production.

Based on clarifying the direction, dispelling superstitions, and liberating thoughts, the conference affirmed the achievements of meteorological work and put forward future tasks and requirements. The conference believes that thanks to the efforts of the whole Party and the entire people, the face of China's meteorological cause has greatly changed in just five months since the Guilin National Meteorological Conference this year. The number of units composing the meteorological service network has greatly increased; compared with the end of last year, the number of meteorological observatories has increased by 126%, and the number of meteorological (weather) stations has increased by 57%. More than 20,000 agricultural meteorological sentry posts and more than 400,000 meteorological groups have also been established in the People's Communes. The future task is to consolidate these achievements, and on the basis of the service network, better serve production as the guiding principle, strengthen cooperation with the agricultural departments, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and under the leadership of the Party, comprehensively carry out mass agricultural meteorological work, and do everything possible to ensure large-scale high yields in agriculture.

In order to adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Jilin Provincial Meteorological Bureau recently built a meteorological station near Tianchi Lake in Changbai Mountain, at an altitude of 2,600 meters. This meteorological station is currently the highest high-mountain meteorological station in Northeast China.

    面向生产  当好尖兵   
    全国农业气象会议进一步明确为生产服务方针
    新华社南京25日电  为了适应农业生产大跃进的形势，加速农业气象工作的发展，从气象上为保证今后大面积丰产作好准备，中央气象局和中国农业科学院最近在南京联合召开了全国农业气象会议。参加这次会议的有各省（区）、市的气象部门、农业科学研究部门和有关高等院校等单位的代表共二百八十二人。
    会议通过鸣放辩论，进一步明确农业气象工作必须为生产服务，农业气象工作者必须当好农业生产的尖兵。会议批判了有些农业气象工作人员为研究而研究，为观测而观测和生产实践脱节不问效果的错误倾向。个别浸透了资产阶级个人主义的人，甚至把研究资料和成果据为私有。会议认为农业气象工作，包括试验研究，都必须密切结合生产，一切资料和工作成果要边做、边用，及时推广到生产中去，使它在农业生产中尽快地发挥作用。代表们列举许多生动事实说明：农业气象工作只要依靠党组织，依靠群众，从生产需要出发，就能得到很快的发展。会议还明确了农业气象工作，还要进一步走在农业生产的前面，才能真正地当好农业生产的尖兵。
    会议代表揭发和批判了农业气象工作中的迷信观点、神秘化和消极等待的思想。这些思想集中表现在对农业气象试验研究和农业气象预报的看法上。如有人认为：农业气象是一门新的科学，不是专家、大学生，没有成套的精密仪器，就不能进行试验研究。还有人将农业气象预报神秘化，认为没有农业气象精确指标，没有多年的资料，就不能作预报。
    会议为了用大量事实破除迷信，交流经验，特地举办了展览会，并作了典型经验介绍；通过一系列的活动，使大家认识到：用土仪器同样也可以进行农业气象试验研究；农业气象预报也并不神秘。当然，气象（候）站同时进行一些比较系统和正规的农业气象观测和鉴定等工作，也是必要的。由于开展补充订正预报使我国二十四小时和灾害性的天气预报准确率比原来提高了10％以上。这些站、哨的观测员，并不是大学生和专家，只是由于他们政治挂了帅，破除了迷信，苦心钻研，虚心向群众学习，就做出这样惊人的成绩。湖北省咸丰县大坝乡农业气象哨，今年9月份开始做补充订正预报，到10月4日止作了十九次，其中十六次完全正确，其余三次也基本上正确，平均准确率达94.1％。在这个哨的影响和指导下，有二十一个气象小组也开始做补充订正预报了。广东阳江县马南农业气象哨不仅做出来的补充订正预报准确率高达97.3％，而且还做出了农业气象预报，对当地农业生产起了良好的作用。
    会议在明确方向、破除迷信、解放思想的基础上，肯定了气象工作的成绩，并提出今后的任务和要求。会议认为由于依靠全党全民的努力奋战，今年桂林全国气象会议以后，仅仅五个月的时间，我国气象事业的面貌已经大大改变了，气象服务网的组成单位大大增加，和去年年底比较，气象台增加了126％，气象（候）站增加了57％。还在人民公社里，设置了两万多农业气象哨和四十多万个气象小组。今后工作任务，是巩固这些成绩，在服务网的基础上，更好地以生产服务为纲，与农业部门加强协作，土洋结合，在党的领导下，全面开展群众性的农业气象工作，千方百计来保证农业大面积丰产丰收。（附图片）
    吉林省气象局为适应工农业生产大跃进的需要，最近在拔海二千六百公尺的长白山的天池附近，建成了一座气象站。这座气象站是目前东北地区高山气象站最高的一处。
