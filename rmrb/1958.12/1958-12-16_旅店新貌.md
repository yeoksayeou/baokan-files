	A Hotel That is Also a Hospital
	Recently, the commercial department of Changchun City opened a new type of hotel in the Nanguan District – the Health Hotel. This hotel specializes in receiving farmers who come to the city for medical treatment and guests from other places who come to Changchun for medical treatment. The hotel has established a close cooperative relationship with the Second Affiliated Hospital of Changchun Medical College, and the hospital sends doctors and nurses to the hotel every week to see patients. The hotel is decorated like a small hospital, with a clinic, a sterilization room, a herbal medicine decoction room, a snack shop, and a library and games room. A tricycle is also prepared to escort patients.
	The hotel staff takes very good care of the guests. In addition to registering and decocting medicine for the guests, they also take care of the patients like nurses. (Illustration by Chen Zhi)
	Father and Son Reunited
	Chen Hanru, a waiter at the Dasheng Hotel, went out on an errand. Just as he walked out of the hotel door, he saw an old man coming towards him. The old man, who was in his sixties or seventies, stood at the door of the hotel for a while, looking worried, and then walked away.
	Chen Hanru could see that the old man had a lot on his mind, so he chased after him and asked him what was wrong, but the old man didn't say anything, he just kept crying. Chen Hanru invited the old man into the hotel and asked him in detail what was wrong. He learned that the old man had come from Xi'an to see his son, but he had lost all his money in a panic when he got off the train. He also lost his son's address. What to do? Chen Hanru hurriedly took out a few yuan and gave it to the old man, saying, "Don't worry, you can stay in the hotel first, and I'll help you find your son." As he spoke, he wrote several missing person notices and posted them at the station and on the streets. He also went to the police station to inquire. After running around for a few days without any news, the old man became so anxious that he sighed all day long.
	One day, the old man accidentally opened his household registration certificate. When Chen Hanru saw it, he realized that the old man had gotten off at the wrong stop. It turned out that the old man was going to Zhangjiakou to see his son who was working in the army. Because he was too old, he got off the train in Beijing by mistake. After finding out the address of the old man's son, Chen Hanru wrote a letter overnight. A few days later, a People's Liberation Army soldier came. The old man was so happy to see his son that he couldn't stop crying. The father and son came to thank Chen Hanru. The old man said, "The Communist Party is so good, they have educated such good people. If it weren't for Comrade Chen, I'm afraid my son and I wouldn't have been able to meet."
	Everything is Available
	The New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai is one of the largest full-service hotels in Shanghai. They provide more than twenty services for travelers, covering almost all aspects of travelers' clothing, food, accommodation, transportation, learning, and business.
	In addition to an attached snack bar, the New Asia Hotel also has a traveler's dining hall. There are various books and periodicals for sale at the hotel entrance. The hotel also has various health medicines for travelers to use in emergencies. In addition, considering the special needs of travelers, they have also set up a bank agency and a storage and consignment business. There has never been a mistake in the consignment of goods.

    旅店新貌
    是旅社也是医院
    长春市商业部门最近在南关区开设了一所新型旅社——健康旅社。这个旅社专门接待进城治病的农民和外地到长春就医的客人。这个旅社与长春医学院附属第二医院建立了密切的协作关系，医院每周都派大夫、护士到旅社为客人看病。旅社里布置得像一个小医院一样。有诊疗室、消毒室、煎药室、小卖部和图书游艺室。还准备了一辆三轮车，护送病人。
    旅社的职工对客人的照顾非常周到，除了代客挂号和煎药外，还像护士一样护理病人。（陈志画）
    父子相逢
    大生客店的服务员陈翰儒有事出门，刚走出店门口，迎面见了位老大爷。这位六、七十岁的老大爷在店门口站了一会，心事重重地就走开了。
    陈翰儒看出这老大爷有一肚子心事，就追上去问，可是老大爷不说话，只一个劲儿地掉眼泪。陈翰儒把老大爷请到店里细细地问，才知道老大爷从西安来看儿子，下火车时，慌慌张张把钱全丢了。儿子的地址也丢了。这怎么办？陈翰儒听了忙掏出几块钱交给老大爷说：“别着急，你先在店里住着，我帮你去找你的儿子。”说着，他就写了几张寻人广告到车站、街头上去贴。他还跑到派出所去打听。跑了几天，也没个音信，老大爷急得整天唉声叹气。
    有天，老大爷无意中打开他的户口迁移证，陈翰儒一看，知道老大爷下错了车，原来老大爷是要去张家口看他的在部队里工作的儿子。因年纪太大了，糊里糊涂在北京下了车。打听到老大爷儿子的地址，陈翰儒连夜写了封信，过了几天，来了位解放军战士，老大爷见了儿子高兴得直流泪，父子两人来向陈翰儒道谢。老大爷说：“共产党真好，教育出这么好的人，要不是陈同志，怕我们父子不能见面了。”
    一应俱全
    设在上海市四川北路的新亚酒店，是上海最大的全能旅馆之一。他们为旅客服务的内容，共有二十多个项目，几乎把旅客的衣、食、住、行、学习和业务方面的服务全部包罗进去了。
    新亚除了附设一个小吃部外，还设立了旅客食堂。旅馆门口有各种书刊出售。旅馆内还备有各种保健药品，供旅客急用，此外，他们考虑到旅客的特殊需要，还设立了银行代办所和保管、托运业务。托运的货物没发生过一次差错。
