We Have Found the Laws of High Wheat Yields
The Communist Party Committee of Anguo County, Hebei Province

In the past, Anguo County, Hebei Province, planted very little wheat, and the farming techniques were poor, with an average yield of about 100 catties per mu. After 1949, the wheat field area gradually expanded, farming techniques were continuously improved, and the yield also gradually increased. However, compared with the yield of other crops, wheat was still the crop with the lowest yield.

In 1958, under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committee, relying on the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of people, and after a winter and spring of hard work, we achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat.

This year, the county planted a total of 183,000 mu of wheat and barley, with an average yield of 491 catties per mu, an increase of two times compared with the yield of 1957, exceeding the original planned 400 catties.

Wheat Bumper Harvest Has Seven Key Points

From the perspective of our county, wheat has jumped from more than 160 catties per mu to more than 400 catties, which is a huge revolution in wheat production. In order to achieve the target of 400 catties, we firmly grasped seven key points from sowing last year to before harvest and launched a wheat bumper harvest leap forward movement.

First, doing a good job of sowing is the foundation for ensuring a wheat leap forward and bumper harvest, and it is the first key point for increasing wheat production. ① Wheat is a crop with many roots and deep roots, and it also has the longest growing period and the most management processes. According to past experience, deep plowing of the land can ensure that the wheat roots are deeply rooted; good land preparation will ensure that the seedlings emerge and grow consistently, reducing the phenomenon of missing seedlings. ② Apply sufficient base fertilizer. Wheat has a long growing period and requires the most fertilizer. Only with sufficient base fertilizer can the seedlings be strong, the overwintering ability be strong, and the yield increase be greater. Last year, we vigorously grasped this link, and the average application of base fertilizer reached about 10,000 catties per mu. ③ Selecting high-quality seeds is the simplest and most effective measure to ensure increased production. In recent years, we have vigorously promoted high-quality seeds such as "Early Foreign Wheat," "Bi Ma" Wheat, "You Zi" Wheat, and "Gan 407." ④ Change planting methods, sow appropriately, and promote wide-row dense planting. ⑤ Strictly grasp the appropriate sowing period. Sowing wheat too early will cause the seedlings to grow excessively, and the winter pre-jointing will be damaged by frost; too late will reduce tillering and reduce cold resistance.

Second, grasp the overwintering key point of wheat. This key point has a long period, from "Start of Winter" to "Rain Water," it has three and a half months. The quality of management during this period has a great impact on wheat production. According to a typical survey by the Wurenqiao Commune, in 1956, watering the frozen water and covering seven carts of fertilizer resulted in a freeze damage mortality rate of 3.2%, with an average yield of 287 catties per mu; without management, the freeze damage mortality rate reached 9.87%. Therefore, we grasped various measures to prevent freeze damage and carried out winter management of wheat fields. According to the drought situation last year, we carried out two winter irrigations and winter hoeings on all wheat fields to maintain the required moisture for wheat and effectively overcome frost and crack damage. After freezing, we universally covered more than 80,000 mu of high-lying wheat fields prone to freeze damage with eight to ten carts of coarse fertilizer, and irrigated 47,000 mu of general wheat fields with human urine, maintaining and increasing the ground temperature and enhancing the cold resistance of wheat.

Third, grasp the greening and tillering key point of wheat. At the "Rain Water" solar term, wheat is about to green up. We vigorously carried out top-dressing of fertilizer, rolling of wheat, and rectification of ridges. According to established yield increase experience, except for alkaline land that is not rolled and sandy land that is not plowed, all wheat fields were universally rolled one to three times. Its function is to increase ground temperature, maintain moisture, promote greening, and greatly increase tillering. By the "Awakening of Insects" solar term, wheat began to green up and tiller, and we timely launched a management upsurge of top-dressing greening fertilizer and watering greening water. According to past experience, the most significant increase in production is watering at the "Awakening of Insects" solar term. This year's survey shows that the effective tillers per plant in the Wurenqiao Commune, which watered at the "Awakening of Insects" solar term, were 2.6, exceeding the number of wheat tillers in history.

Fourth, grasp the jointing key point of wheat. By the "Pure Brightness" solar term, wheat began to joint. At this time, if water and fertilizer are sufficient, the growth will be fast, the maternal fertilizer will be strong, and the spike will be large. At the same time, it can also generate a large number of roots, enhancing the ability of wheat to absorb underground water and nutrients to ensure effective tillering. This year, we regarded this stage as one of the most important key points in spring management, and vigorously launched a management upsurge of top-dressing jointing fertilizer and watering jointing water. We universally applied three to five carts of old house soil or 700 to 1,000 catties of human manure slurry, as well as quick-acting fertilizers such as brine and fire nitrate, as top dressing once, thoroughly irrigated with large water, and universally carried out one cultivation to ensure the healthy growth of wheat.

Fifth, grasp the heading protection key point. At the "Grain Rain" solar term, wheat began to bud and head. During this period, wheat changes very quickly. If management is strengthened, the spikes can be protected, the grains can be plump, and the yield can be greatly increased; otherwise, production will be reduced. Therefore, we firmly grasped three measures: universally applied 10 to 15 catties of chemical fertilizer to all wheat fields for chasing, tightly irrigated a large amount of water, and universally carried out cultivation and soil consolidation, which played a great role in increasing production.

Sixth, "Start of Summer" is the wheat heading, flowering, and grain-filling period, which is the sixth key point for managing production increase. We launched a blitz management movement centered on "three increases" (three increases are increase in spikes, grains, and weight; three universals are universal top dressing, weeding, and watering).

Seventh, do a good job of harvesting. This is an important key point to ensure getting 400 catties of wheat. We put forward the slogan "Do not give up the struggle until 400 catties are in hand," and carried out rushing to harvest, rushing to thresh, and meticulous harvesting, consistently adhering to the movement of planting well, growing well, and harvesting well.

Around the above measures, we mobilized the entire Party and the entire people from sowing last autumn, and timely launched nearly ten large-scale management upsurges. More than 170 cadres and more than 20 Party committee secretaries specializing in wheat management in the county spent most of their time in the wheat fields.

Grasp Five Major Links

In the upsurge of the wheat leap forward and production increase movement, we firmly grasped the following points:

1. Grasp ideological mobilization, focus on the practical and insist on achieving 400 catties. Carrying out a wheat leap forward and production increase is a revolution in production. Every new thing develops through the struggle between the advanced and the backward. In the wheat leap forward and production increase movement, we are advancing on the basis of constantly fighting resolutely against right-leaning conservative ideas and constantly achieving victories. From the beginning of planting wheat last year, we encountered various right-leaning conservative ideas. It was mainly reflected in the promotion of high-quality seeds, dense planting, cultivation, and sowing time. Some cadres and the masses believed that the bran of the high-yield, disaster-resistant "Early Foreign" wheat could not feed livestock, the skin color was not good, and the yield increase was not much, so they opposed its promotion. Secondly, there were concerns that dense planting would not grow. Furthermore, because the autumn harvest task was heavy at that time, it was believed that it would be difficult to complete sowing during the Cold Dew solar term, showing right-leaning fear of difficulties and other emotions. In response, we launched a mass debate throughout the county centered on the above issues, and in conjunction with the debate, each commune summarized the facts of past yield increases from high-quality seeds, dense planting, and early sowing, and yield reductions from inferior seeds, sparse planting, and late sowing, and used comparison methods to give the masses a lesson. In this way, we finally broke through the various conservative ideas in sowing, overcame the fear of difficulties, and the county launched a blitz sowing upsurge, thereby completing the sowing plan on time and with quality. This spring, when we proposed a plan of 400 catties per mu, we encountered even greater resistance from right-leaning conservative ideas. Some cadres and the masses had great doubts about this target. Especially for high-yield wheat of more than 1,000 catties and secondary wheat production increase, they showed even less confidence. Based on this situation, we first launched a vigorous propaganda movement to seize the first step in the whole county, and organized a mass debate among the entire Party and the entire people on topics such as whether wheat can achieve a bumper harvest, whether secondary wheat can increase production, whether 400 catties can be achieved, how to achieve a bumper harvest, and how to increase secondary wheat production. We also criticized conservative ideas and inspired the enthusiasm of the masses by presenting facts and calculating production increase accounts.

Right-leaning conservative ideas cannot be solved by one or two educations. New ones appear as soon as difficulties are encountered. Before the "Grain Rain" solar term, due to the severe development of drought and the slow growth of wheat, and there were still 10,000 mu of poorly growing wheat that had not been eliminated, some cadres and the masses had serious fears and showed wavering emotions about the 400 catties. In response, we timely carried out ideological education on drought resistance to protect the harvest, and a new upsurge appeared. In addition, the slack mood generated after the rain and the feelings of failure that appeared in some communes due to lodging were all resolved in a timely manner through education. In this way, the emotions of the masses were kept constantly full, and the movement was constantly pushed to a climax.

2. Firmly grasp both ends, eliminate imbalance. According to the different wheat field conditions in our county, we emphasized that measures cannot be generalized, and specific management must be strengthened according to the specific situation. We adopted the method of continuously ranking, continuously proposing new tasks and new measures to guide the continuous progress of the wheat leap forward and production increase movement. One end is to grasp the high-yield 1,000-catties wheat to ensure the realization of a bumper harvest; the other end is to grasp the secondary wheat, change the third category to the second category, and strive to become the first category. In this way, not only were the measures concrete, but also the fighting goals of the cadres and commune members were clarified. By the "Pure Brightness" solar term, all the more than 60,000 mu of high-yield wheat in the county had been universally top-dressed twice, and some had been top-dressed three times. Secondary wheat with few and weak seedlings was also fertilized and replanted. After management, the first-category wheat increased from the original 60,000 mu to 73,000 mu, and the third-category wheat decreased from the original 35,000 mu to 20,000 mu. After the "Grain Rain" solar term, a second ranking was carried out, and it was found that some of the high-yield wheat had insufficient stamina and showed signs of yellowing and weakening; the secondary wheat was not uniformly top-dressed, and the seedlings were not uniform and could not be upgraded. Based on this, we timely put forward new management tasks: high-yield wheat should be top-dressed with quick fertilizer, secondary wheat should be top-dressed with partial fertilizer, and universal thorough watering measures, and put forward the slogan "Every seedling is flat, the seedlings are black and green, upgrade and upgrade again, eliminate imbalance," and quickly set off a new management upsurge. After such continuous ranking, various types of wheat fields continued to change. By mid-May, the first-category wheat had increased to 83,000 mu, and the third-category wheat had decreased to 10,000 mu.

3. Secretaries at all levels personally grasp the first step, grasp the 400 catties of wheat, this is a strategic measure. If our county achieves 400 catties of wheat, it will increase production by 145% compared with last year, more than doubling it. This is an arduous task. Therefore, we put grasping 400 catties of wheat in the first place in spring production, and the Party committees at all levels included it in the central agenda of the meeting. Wheat was studied first at every meeting. Since the beginning of spring, the county party committee alone has convened ten telephone conferences, two broadcast conferences, and seven township and commune cadre conferences, as well as two wheat special conferences attended by party committee secretaries and two on-site promotion meetings. In order to further strengthen leadership, from the county to the township and commune, a secretary was appointed to personally grasp the wheat. The method of grasping is to grasp the key points, grasp both ends, and conduct experiments. The township party committee secretaries personally conducted experiments in the communes in the villages where they lived, grasping the key points, finding experience, finding problems, and setting examples. Through on-site exhibitions, organizing visits, and on-site teaching methods, they specifically guided and solved many important problems in various production increase key points. According to statistics, party secretaries and cadres at all levels in the county have cultivated a total of 2,093 mu of wheat experimental fields, summarized and promoted six important experiences, which have played a huge role in guiding the wheat production increase movement. The more important thing about the secretary taking action is that they can stand in front of the movement and go to the most difficult places, which more powerfully strengthens the guidance of the movement. The members of Zhongsong Village, Wurenqiao Township, were disappointed in the management of 200 mu of secondary wheat due to the lack of water from distant wells. The party committee secretary personally went deep into the commune, helped the masses to come up with a method of gathering water from multiple wells, and specifically organized the masses to take the lead in doing practical work. The water problem was solved, the masses were mobilized, and they rushed to water day and night. The wheat seedlings quickly turned from yellow to black and from weak to strong.

4. Strengthening specific organizational work is an important key to ensuring the realization of 400 catties. At first, it was common for the team leader to assign people and tasks to manage wheat every day, and the responsibilities of the commune members were not clear, resulting in many rough phenomena. Based on this, we universally carried out the organization of specialized teams in each commune in the county and implemented the "five fixed" organizational management methods, which greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of the commune members and enhanced their sense of responsibility. At the same time, it also improved production quality, overcame procrastination and rough farming phenomena, and enabled various production activities to be carried out in an orderly manner.

5. Carrying out competitions, organizing inspections, and conducting regular evaluations constantly push the wheat leap forward and production increase movement to a climax. From the beginning of spring, we linked the 28 townships in the county to each other according to their conditions and distance, and made wheat production one of the important contents of inspection, evaluation, and listing in each movement month in the spring, which effectively promoted the wheat field management movement. In addition, we broke through the linking boundaries between townships and carried out a wheat field management competition movement in the form of "setting up a stage, calling for battle, and comparing martial arts" throughout the county, which inspired the enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses to compete for advancement and grasp 400 catties. In terms of methods, we proposed tasks according to the content of different periods, stipulated the time, designated the names to call for battle to carry out competitions, and "sneak attack" inspections each other at any time, and clearly distinguished the victory or defeat according to the quality, speed, and speed of completion. The winners are rewarded and the losers send the flag. This is a very in-depth mass line working method.

Although we have achieved some results in the wheat leap forward and production increase movement, we have also encountered many problems and there are many lessons that should be learned. First of all, wheat sowing in 1957 was carried out under very dry conditions, sowing one piece and irrigating one piece. Therefore, the sowing of some wheat fields was not timely, and the additional 10,000 mu of tasks that were rushed to sow later generally resulted in rough phenomena. Some wheat fields were not planted in the appropriate season, so this year there was a common phenomenon of late greening and large areas of secondary wheat. Second, because we lack the guidance level of science and technology, the phenomenon of low seed application rate generally occurred in sowing. In addition, improper seed treatment and some neglect of insect pests have resulted in sparse plant numbers and many missing seedlings in some wheat fields this year. Furthermore, there is a lack of in-depth research and specific guidance on technology, so there is a common phenomenon of wide nodes and large ridges, and the land utilization rate is very low, which has had a great impact on this year's production increase. At the same time, there are also many problems in management. First of all, our work still lacks practicality, and some measures are not deeply implemented in some links, making the movement develop unevenly. For example, in each upsurge, there are tails left in individual communes. Although the "five fixed" method has been universally promoted throughout the county, the implementation in individual communes has been reduced to formalities. (Attached picture)

    我们找到了小麦高产的规律   
    中共河北安国县委会
    河北省安国县过去种麦很少，耕作技术低劣，平均亩产量百斤左右。1949年后，麦田面积逐年扩大，耕作技术不断提高，产量也逐步提高。但是与各项作物的单产比较，小麦仍然是一项产量最低的作物。
    1958年在上级党的正确领导下，依靠广大人民群众的智慧和力量，经过一冬一春的苦干，我们获得了空前未有的小麦大丰收。
    今年全县共种植大小麦十八万三千亩，平均亩产四百九十一斤，比1957年亩产增产二倍，超过原订四百斤计划。
    小麦丰产有七关
    从我县情况看，小麦由亩产一百六十多斤跃进到四百多斤，这在小麦生产上是一个巨大的革命运动。为了实现四百斤的跃进指标，从去年播种到收获前紧紧抓住了七个关，开展了小麦丰产跃进运动。
    第一、搞好播种是保证小麦跃进大丰收的基础，是小麦增产第一关。①小麦是多根、根深作物，又是生长期最长、管理过程最多的作物。根据以往经验，深耕土地能保证小麦根系深扎；整好地，苗子就出土生长一致，减少缺苗断垅现象。②施足底肥。小麦生长期长、需肥量最多。只有底肥足，苗子才壮，越冬能力才强，增产量越大。去年我们大力抓住了这一环节，平均达到亩施底肥万斤左右。③选用优种，是保证增产而方法最为简便的有效措施。几年来我们大力推广了“早洋麦”，“碧蚂”麦，“秞子”麦，“干四○七”等优种。④改变种植方法，适量播种，推广宽幅密植。⑤严格掌握适期播种。小麦播种过早会造成麦苗徒长，冬前拔节遭冻害；过晚则会减少分蘖和降低御寒能力。
    第二、抓住了小麦越冬关。这一关时期较长，从“立冬”到“雨水”拥有三个半月，这一段管的好坏对小麦增产有很大作用。据伍仁桥社的典型调查，1956年浇了冻水，盖了七车肥，冻害死亡率3.2％，平均亩产量二百八十七斤；没有管理的，冻害死亡率达9.87％。因此，我们抓住了防止冻害的各项措施，开展了麦田越冬管理。根据去年天旱情况，对所有麦田进行了两次冬灌和冬锄，保持了小麦所需水分，有效克服了冻、裂伤害。上冻后，对八万多亩易受冻害的高岗麦田普遍用八至十车粗肥进行了蒙盖，对四万七千亩一般麦田用人尿进行了浇灌，保持和提高了地温，增强了小麦御寒能力。
    第三、抓住了返青分蘖关。“雨水”节小麦即将返青，我们大力开展了顶凌耙麦、轧麦、整畦运动。按着既定的增产经验，除碱地不轧、沙地不耙，对所有麦田普遍轧耙了一至三遍。其作用在于提高地温，保持墒情，促进返青，大量增加分蘖。至“惊蛰”节，小麦开始返青分蘖，我们适时开展了追返青肥，浇返青水的管理高潮。根据历年经验，增产最显著的是“惊蛰”浇水。今年调查，伍仁桥社惊蛰浇水的单株有效分蘖二点六个，超过历史上小麦分蘖数。
    第四、抓住了小麦拔节关。到
  “清明”节小麦就开始拔节，这时如果水肥充足，生长就快，胎肥穗大，同时还能够大量滋生根系，增强小麦吸收地下水分养分的能力，以保证有效分蘖。今年我们把这一段当成了春季管理的重要关键之一，大力开展了追拔节肥，浇拔节水的管理高潮。普遍用三至五车老房土或七百至一千斤人粪稀以及用卤水、火硝等速效肥料追肥一次，大水透灌了一遍，并普遍进行了一次中耕，保证了小麦健壮生长。
    第五、抓住了抽穗保产关。“谷雨”节小麦开始打苞抽穗。这段时间里，小麦变化很快，如果加强管理，就能保穗齐、籽粒肥、大量增产，否则就会造成减产。因此，我们紧紧抓住了三项措施：对所有麦田普遍用十至十五斤化肥赶追了一次，紧灌了一大水，并普遍进行了中耕培土，这对增产起了很大作用。
    第六、“立夏”正是小麦秀穗、扬花、灌浆期，这是管理增产的第六关。我们突击开展了以“三增”为中心的三普管理运动（三增是增穗、粒、重量；三普是普追、锄、浇）。
    第七、抓好收获关。这是保证拿到小麦四百斤最后的一个重要关口。我们提出了“四百不到手，斗争不罢休”的口号，开展了抢收、抢打和精收细打，始终如一的坚持作到了种好、长好、收好运动。
    围绕上述措施，我们从去秋播种，就动员了全党全民，适时开展了近十次大规模的管理高潮，全县有一百七十多名干部和二十多名专管小麦的党委书记，绝大部分时间是扎在麦田里。
    抓住五大环节
    在小麦跃进增产运动的高潮中，我们紧紧抓住了以下几点：
    1、抓思想鼓干劲，以虚带实，坚取四百斤。搞小麦跃进增产，是生产上的一场革命。每一个新的东西都是经过先进与落后的斗争而发展的。在小麦跃进增产的运动中，我们是在不断和右倾保守思想进行坚决斗争，并不断取得胜利的基础上前进的。从去年种麦开始，就遇到了各种右倾保守思想的阻击。突出表现在优种的推广、密植、耕作、播种时间等方面。部分干部群众，对增产多、抗灾力强的优种“早洋”麦，认为麦糠不能喂牲口，皮色不好，增产不多，反对推广。其次是顾虑密植长不起来。再就是由于当时秋收任务大，认为寒露节完成播种有困难，表现右倾畏难情绪等。对此，我们就以上述问题为中心，在全县范围展开了一场全民性的大辩论，并结合辩论，各社总结了以往优种、密植、早种增产，劣种、稀植、晚播减产的事实，用对比方法，给群众上了一课。这样，终于打破了播种中的各种保守思想，克服了畏难情绪，全县展开了突击播种高潮，从而按时按质完成 了播种计划。今春当我们提出亩产四百斤的计划后，则遇到了右倾保守思想的更大阻击。部分干部群众，对这个指标抱有很大怀疑。尤其对千斤以上的丰产麦和次麦增产，则更表现没信心。根据这种情况，我们首先在全县范围大张旗鼓的开展了抓第一把的宣传运动，并在全党全民中组织了小麦能不能丰产，次麦能不能增产，四百斤能否实现，丰产怎样丰，次麦怎样增等不同题目的大辩论，还通过摆事实、算增产账的方法，批判了保守思想，启发群众干劲。
    右倾保守思想不是经过一两次教育所能解决的，一遇到困难就又出现新的。到“谷雨”节前，由于旱象发展严重，小麦生长很慢，还有一万亩生长不好的麦没有消灭，部分干部、群众对四百斤又发生了严重的畏难情绪，表现动摇。对此，我们又适时开展了抗旱保丰收的思想教育，新的高潮又出现了。此外，雨后产生的松懈情绪和部分社因倒伏而出现的失败情绪，都及时通过教育得到了解决。就这样，使群众的情绪保持了经常饱满，运动不断推向高涨。
    2、狠狠抓两头，消灭不平衡，根据我县的麦田情况不同，因此，我们强调措施不能一般化，必须分别情况，加强具体管理。我们采取了不断排队，不断提出新的任务，新的措施，指导了小麦跃进增产运动的不断前进。第一头是抓丰产千斤麦，保证实现丰产；再一头是抓次麦，变三类为二类，争取变成一类。这样一来，不光措施具体了，而且干部社员的奋斗目标也明确了。到“清明”节，全县对六万多亩丰产麦，就普遍追了两次肥，有的搞了三次。对苗少苗弱的次麦，也进行了加肥和栽补。经过管理，一类麦由原来六万亩增到七万三千亩，三类麦由原来三万五千亩降到二万亩。到“谷雨”节后，又进行了第二次排队，发现部分丰产麦后劲不足，呈现黄弱；次麦因追肥不匀，苗子不齐不能升级。据此，我们又及时提出了新的管理任务：丰产麦追快肥，次麦追偏肥，普遍透浇水的措施，并提出“块块苗子平，苗子黑又青，升级再升级，消灭不平衡”的口号，又迅速掀起了新的管理高潮。经过这样不断排队，随之各类麦田不断变化，到5月中旬，一类麦已增到八万三千亩，三类麦已降低到一万亩。
    3、各级书记亲自抓第一把，抓小麦四百斤，这是战略措施。我县把小麦搞成四百斤，比去年就要增产145％，翻一番还多，这是一项艰巨的任务。因此，我们把抓小麦四百斤摆在了春季生产的第一位，各级党委都列入了会议的中心议题，每次开会都先研究小麦。从入春到现在光县委就召开十次电话会议、二次广播大会、七次乡社干部大会，并召开两次党委书记参加的小麦专题会和两次现场促进会。为了进一步加强领导，从县到乡、社，都确定了一名书记亲自抓小麦。抓的方法是抓重点、抓两头搞试验。各乡党委书记都在乡所住村的社内亲自搞试验，抓关节、找经验、找问题、作样子，通过现场展览，组织参观，就地传授的方法，具体指导，解决了各个增产关节上的很多重要问题。据统计全县各级书记和干部共搞了二千零九十三亩小麦试验田，总结和推广了六条重要经验，对指导小麦增产运动起了巨大作用。书记动手更重要的是在于能够站在运动的前面，到最困难的地方去，这就更有力的加强了运动的指导。伍仁桥乡中送村的社员对二百亩次麦，因井远缺水，管理失望，党委书记就亲自深入到这个社，帮助群众想出了多井汇浇办法，并具体组织群众带头实干。水的问题解决了，群众发动起来了，昼夜突击浇水，麦苗很快由黄变黑，由弱变壮。
    4、加强具体组织工作，是保证实现四百斤的重要关键。起初普遍是队长每天对小麦管理派人、派活，社员责任又不明确，发生了很多粗糙现象。据此，我们在全县各社，普遍进行了组织专业队，实行
  “五固定”的组织管理方法，大大启发了社员生产积极性，增强了责任心。同时也提高了生产质量，克服了窝工和农活粗糙现象，使各项生产有秩序地开展起来。
    5、开展竞赛，组织检查，定期评比，使小麦跃进增产运动不断推向高潮。我们从入春开始，就把全县二十八个乡，根据条件和距离，互相挂了钩，并把小麦生产当成春季每个运动月的检查评比和上榜夺旗的重要内容之一，这就有效地促进了麦田管理运动。此外，还打破了乡与乡的挂钩界限，在全县范围开展了“立擂叫阵、打擂比武”形式的麦田管理竞赛运动，启发了干部群众争先进抓四百斤的干劲。在方法上是根据不同时期的内容，提出任务，规定时间，指名叫阵开展竞赛，随时互相“偷袭”检查，根据完成好坏、快慢，分明胜负。胜者受奖，败者送旗。这是一条很深入的群众路线工作方法。
    我们虽然在小麦跃进增产运动中取得了一些成绩，但是也发生很多问题，也有许多应该记取的教训。首先是1957年的小麦播种是在十分干旱的情况下进行的，浇一块播一块，因而部分麦田播种还不适时，又加赶播后来追加的万亩任务，普遍发生粗糙现象，部分麦田没有种在应时季节，所以造成今年普遍出现返青晚和大片次麦。第二是由于我们缺乏科学技术的指导水平，因而，在播种中普遍发生籽种施量少的现象，加上籽种处理不当和对虫害有所忽视，以致使今年的部分麦田株数稀，缺苗多。再就是缺乏对技术的深入研究和具体指导，因此普遍存在着节口宽、畦口大的现象，土地的利用率很低，这些已给今年增产造下了很大影响。同时在管理当中，也发生和存在着不少问题，首先是我们的工作还缺乏切实性，某些措施在某些环节上贯彻的不深透，使运动发展不平衡。如在每次高潮中在个别社内都留有尾巴。“五定”办法，虽然在全县普遍进行了推广，但是个别社在执行上却流于形式。（附图片）
