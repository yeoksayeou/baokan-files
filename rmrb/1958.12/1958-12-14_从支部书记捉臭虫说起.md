    Starting from the Branch Secretary Catching Bedbugs
    Shu Nan
    Recently, workers at the Shanghai Huxin Steel Factory have been widely spreading a story: the branch secretary catching bedbugs. Ye Deyao, the Party branch secretary of the No. 1 workshop, and Pu A’fa, the workshop director, heard that bedbugs had been found in the workers' dormitory, so they rushed to inspect, checking each room one by one, and indeed caught more than a dozen. The next day, Ye Deyao led a youth shock team to catch bedbugs for another half day, and also sprayed them with "DDT" and "666."
    Catching bedbugs is a trivial matter. However, the workers wrote an article about it and submitted it to the Jiefang Daily; the Jiefang Daily also published it. This shows that although the matter is small, it is not simple.
    Some may say: the branch secretary has many things to do, why does he have to go to the workers' dormitory himself, catching bedbugs from room to room, bed to bed? Isn't that a bit of bureaucratism? Let's first listen to the workers' opinions: "Our branch secretary and workshop director take care of everything, not only production and ideological work, but also our workers' eating and sleeping!" Please listen, what heartfelt gratitude and praise!
    Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers and peasants, with all their energy, are building socialism faster, better, and more economically, with a selfless spirit. Like the workers of the Shanghai Huxin Steel Factory, they hope that the Party will not only manage production and ideology..., but also "take care of everything," including rest. Because building socialism is not a matter of one morning or two days, but requires a considerable period of struggle. People on all fronts of socialist construction need not only persistent hard work, but also sufficient rest. People are like machines. If a machine is not oiled and rested regularly, it will be damaged and accidents will occur; if people do not get the necessary rest, they will also be tired and affect production. The Party branch secretary and workshop director of the No. 1 workshop of the Shanghai Huxin Steel Factory recognized the importance of letting workers rest well for improving production. How could they allow bedbugs to exist?
    Chairman Mao, in "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," written during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, warned us long ago: "Do you want the support of the masses? Do you want them to devote all their strength to the front? Then you must be with the masses, you must arouse their enthusiasm, you must be concerned with their pain, you must sincerely seek their interests, and solve their problems of production and life, the problem of salt, the problem of rice, the problem of housing, the problem of clothing, the problem of childbirth, solve all the problems of the masses." Today's revolutionary situation is many times better than that time; today's tasks of the Party and the people of the whole country are also many times heavier than that time. However, the more so, the more we should be meticulously concerned with the pain of the masses and solve all the difficulties of the masses, so that we can inspire greater enthusiasm among the masses and build socialism at an early date. The branch secretary of the Huxin Steel Factory is one of the many cadres of our Party who go deep among the masses and care about the masses. We need more such comrades who do not let go of any problem in the lives of the masses that should be solved, just like they do not let go of a bedbug.

    从支部书记捉臭虫说起
    舒楠
    上海沪新钢铁厂工人们最近盛传着一件事：支部书记捉臭虫。第一车间的党支部书记叶德耀和车间主任浦阿法听到工人宿舍里有人发现一只臭虫，连忙就赶去检查，一个一个房间查过来，果然被他们捉到了十几只。第二天，叶德耀带了青年突击队，又整整地捉了半天，并且还给打上“滴滴涕”、“六六六”。
    捉臭虫本是一件小事。工人们却把这件事写了稿子，投寄解放日报；解放日报也发表了它。可见得事情虽小，却也并不简单。
    有人也许会说：支部书记该做的事情多得很，干吗非得自己跑到工人宿舍一间一间，一张床一张床的捉臭虫，岂不有点事务主义吗？我们还是先听听工人的意见吧：“我们的支部书记和车间主任样样都管，不但管生产，管思想工作，还管我们工人的吃饭和睡眠哩！”请听，这是多么衷心的感激和赞扬！
    广大的工农群众，在党的领导下，鼓足了干劲，以忘我的精神，多快好省的建设社会主义，他们像上海沪新钢铁厂工人们那样，希望党不但管生产、管思想……，还要“样样都管”当然也就包括管休息。因为，建设社会主义并不是一朝一夕、两天三天的事情，需要经过相当长时期的奋斗。在建设社会主义的各个战线上的人，不仅需要坚持不懈的艰苦劳动，也需要足够的休息。人好比一架机器。机器如果不定期擦擦油，休息一下，就会损坏，就会出事故；人如果得不到必要的休息，也会疲劳，也会影响生产。上海沪新钢铁厂第一车间的党支部书记和车间主任正是认识了让工人好好休息对提高生产的重要意义。他们怎么还能容许臭虫存在呢？
    毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期所写的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”中，早就告诫我们：“要得到群众的拥护么？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，盐的问题，米的问题，房子的问题，衣的问题，生小孩子的问题，解决群众的一切问题。”今天的革命形势，比起那个时候，要好多少倍；今天党和全国人民的任务，比起那个时候，也要重多少倍。然而，越是这样，我们就越应该无微不至地关心群众的痛痒，解决群众的一切困难，这才能够鼓起群众更大的干劲，早日建成社会主义。沪新钢铁厂的这位支部书记是我们党许许多多深入群众，关心群众的干部中的一个，我们需要更多的这样的同志，他们不放过群众生活中任何一个应该解决的问题，就像不放过一个臭虫一样。
