New Spring Couplets

Year after year, the Great Leap Forward is celebrated with joy. The past year saw the greatest leap forward.
Year after year, we celebrate high speed, wishing for even higher speed in the New Year.
　　
　　
Transportation takes the lead, electricity takes the lead, opening up the Three Mountains and clearing the Five Ridges, paving a smooth path for the Great Leap Forward.
The Iron Marshal and the Machinery Marshal lead a thousand troops and command ten thousand horses, heading straight for the peak of victory.
　　
　　
In the year of the Great Leap Forward, iron, coal, and oil achieve bumper harvests.
In the year of bumper harvests, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all make leaps forward.
Large enterprises and small enterprises everywhere vigorously promote mass movements.
Foreign methods and indigenous methods are used in every industry to promote technological innovation.
