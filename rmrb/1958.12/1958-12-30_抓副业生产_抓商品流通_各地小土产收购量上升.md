Grasp Sideline Production, Grasp Commodity Circulation
Local Specialty Product Purchases Increase

(Our Dispatch) Due to the vigorous efforts of Party committees at all levels in promoting sideline production and purchasing work, the procurement progress of local specialty products has greatly accelerated recently in various regions. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, as of the end of November, the total national purchase amount of local products reached approximately 1.8 billion yuan; the provinces of Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Henan, Liaoning, Jilin, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Zhejiang have already exceeded their annual purchase plans. The expansion of local product purchases has supported the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, increased the income of the People's Communes, and promoted the development and consolidation of the People's Communes.

During this period, commercial departments in various regions, under the leadership of the Party committees, formulated local product purchasing and sales plans based on the needs of central work, and then the Party committees uniformly arranged for their implementation. Centering on the needs of iron and steel production and river network development, Henan Province vigorously grasped the production and purchase of local products such as grass bags, reed mats, saltpeter, charcoal, earthen baskets, earthen hampers, and carrying poles, supplying the needs of iron and steel production and water conservancy construction, and expanding the purchase volume of local products. The Gannan area of Jiangxi Province recently organized a large number of cadres and masses to go to the mountains to collect and purchase local products. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen counties, over 40 million jin of various wild plants were purchased in five days, an increase of more than ten times compared to the total purchase volume from January to October.

Commercial departments in many regions have assisted the People's Communes in making plans for sideline production, and promoted and improved the contract system, so that the state's local product purchase plans and the People's Communes' production and collection plans are linked together. Some areas have also implemented the "four guarantees" method of guaranteeing time, quantity, quality, and transportation, and the "four selfs" method of self-acceptance, weighing, packaging, and storage by the communes. These have brought into play the enthusiasm of the communes, expanded the purchase volume, and accelerated the procurement speed. Commercial departments in many regions have mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovation movements, creating many advanced collection, processing, and transportation tools, improving production efficiency, and saving labor. For example, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places have erected aerial cableways and wooden rail slides, which not only solved the problem of transporting Mao bamboo from the deep mountains, but also increased the Mao bamboo transportation efficiency by several times to dozens of times.

### 抓副业生产  抓商品流通  各地小土产收购量上升

    抓副业生产  抓商品流通
    各地小土产收购量上升
    本报讯  由于各级党委大抓副业生产和收购工作，最近各地土产品采购进度大大加快。据商业部不完全的统计，截至11月底，全国土产采购总额约达十八亿元；黑龙江、广东、河南、辽宁、吉林、山西、贵州、浙江等省已经超额完成了全年的采购计划。土产品采购量的扩大，支援了工农业生产的跃进，增加了人民公社的收入，促进了人民公社的发展和巩固。
    这一时期，各地商业部门在党委领导下，根据中心工作的需要，制定了土产购销规划，然后由党委统一布置执行。河南省围绕钢铁生产和河网化的需要，大抓草袋、苇席、火硝、木炭、土筐、土篮、扁担等土产的生产和收购工作，供应了钢铁生产和兴修水利的需要，又扩大了土产采购量。江西省赣南地区最近组织大批干部群众，上山采集和收购土产，据十三个县不完全的统计，五天就收购各种野生植物四千多万斤，比1至10月份收购总数增加十倍以上。
    许多地区的商业部门帮助人民公社进行了副业生产规划，推广和改进了合同制度，使国家的土产收购计划和人民公社的生产采集计划衔接起来。有些地区还实行了包时间、包数量、包质量、包运输的“四包”办法，推行了公社自行验收、过秤、包装和保管的“四自”办法。这都发挥了公社的积极性，扩大了收购数量，加快了采购速度。不少地区的商业部门发动群众开展技术革新运动，创造了许多先进的采集、加工和运输工具，提高了生产效率，节省了劳动力。如浙江、福建等地架设了空中索道和木轨滑车，既解决了深山中毛竹的运输问题，又使毛竹运输效率提高数倍至数十倍。
