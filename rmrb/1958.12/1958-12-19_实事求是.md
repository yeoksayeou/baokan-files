    Seeking Truth From Facts
    He Cheng
    According to the Shanxi Daily, the Changqing People's Commune in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, near the end of the autumn harvest, announced a battle result based on the actual harvesting and on-site yield estimation: a grain yield of 1,221 jin per mu and 20,000 jin of vegetables. Recent verification results show that, except for the vegetable yield remaining unchanged, the grain yield was revised to 1,070 jin. At the same time, the commune also made some modifications to its targets for next year.
    Although the difference between 1,221 jin and 1,070 jin is not significant, the Changqing People's Commune has set a good example for us, which is to treat problems with an honest and truth-seeking attitude. This is a genuine Marxist attitude.
    The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes" points out: "Our economic work must become more and more meticulous, and our leading cadres at all levels must be good at distinguishing between the true and false appearances of things, distinguishing between well-founded demands and unfounded demands, and striving to make judgments about situations as close as possible to objective reality. Only in this way can we formulate and implement our plans on a truly reliable basis." The Changqing People's Commune's attitude towards yield is precisely this attitude of not exaggerating, not concealing shortcomings, and making the yield as consistent with reality as possible after verification.
    After verification, when inconsistencies are found between the previous and subsequent figures, some people adopt another attitude, which is to perpetuate the error, believing that since a certain amount has already been announced in the past, it would be inglorious to say a different amount now. This view is certainly incorrect. Although there may be slight or even significant changes in the figures before and after, the overall picture is that grain production has increased this year, and not just a little, but significantly, with the increase being not a few percentage points, but tens or even hundreds of percentage points. Correcting errors immediately after they are discovered, lowering overestimations and raising underestimations – only communists can do this. How can this be considered an inglorious thing? Is it glorious to persist in error?
    There are two types of falsehoods: one is unintentional, which arises because of an insufficiently accurate understanding of objective circumstances, thus leading to false phenomena. For example, inaccurate estimates of grain yield lead to untruthful figures being reported. This is a problem of method or style. The other is intentional, where the actual yield is clearly 500 jin, but it is falsely reported as 600, 800, or even 1,000 jin. Even after being exposed, the original figures are insisted upon. This is a matter of character.
    However, regardless of the type of falsehood, failing to correct it is greatly detrimental to the cause of the Party. Formulating principles, policies, and plans based on these figures will inevitably lead to serious problems. These principles, policies, and plans will not align with the actual situation and will therefore be impossible to implement; if they are to be implemented, it can only be done through coercive orders. This will exhaust and greatly dissatisfy the people.
    When we verify, especially when changing certain figures, the "wait-and-see faction" and the "accounting faction" will seize the opportunity to launch a counterattack. This is not a big deal. Their counterattack is weak and powerless. In the debates about this matter at the Changqing People's Commune, the wait-and-see faction was no longer as assertive as it was in the spring. This is because the facts have long proven that the great leap forward in agricultural production this year is beyond doubt.
    Verification is a very important task, and not only should the Changqing People's Commune do it, but other people's communes should also do it. Only on this basis can the increased production targets set for next year be both advanced and reliable.

    实事求是
    何成
    据山西日报报道：太原市郊区常青人民公社，在秋收临近结束的时候，曾经根据收打的实情和地头估产，宣布过一次战果：粮食亩产一千二百二十一斤，蔬菜两万斤。最近核实的结果，除蔬菜产量没有变动外，粮食改为一千零七十斤。与此同时，这个社对明年的指标，也作了些修改。
    一千二百二十一斤和一千零七十斤，两者相差虽然不多，但是常青人民公社却给我们树立了一个良好的榜样，这就是对待问题的老老实实、实事求是的态度。这是真正的马克思主义的态度。
    “关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出：“我们的经济工作必须愈作愈细致，我们的各级领导工作人员必须善于区别事物的真象和假象，区别有根
  据的要求和没有根据的要求，对情况的判断必须力求接近客观实际。只有这样，我们才能在确实可靠 的基础上制定和实现我们的计划。”常青人民公社对待产量的态度，正是这种不浮夸、不隐瞒缺点，并且经过核实之后，使产量尽可能符合实际的态度。
    在核实之后，发现前后数字不符合的时候，也有持另一种态度的，那就是：将错就错，认为既然过去已经宣布过多少了，现在又说多少，这不大光彩。这种说法当然不对。前后数字虽然略有变动，或者有较大的变动，但是从总的来说，今年粮食还是增产的，并且不是小有增产，还是大有增产，即增产的比例不是百分之几，而是百分之几十，以至一百。在发现错误之后，立即加以改正，把估计过高的下降，估计过低的上升。这只有共产党人才能做得到。这怎能说是不光彩的事情呢？难道坚持错误才算光彩吗？
    作假有两种：一种是无意的，这是因为对客观情况了解不够正确，因而发生了作假现象。如因为对粮食产量估计不正确，所以上报的数字也不真实。这是方法问题或者是作风问题。一种是有意的，明明实际产量是五百，但要谎报六百、八百，以至一千。甚至被人识破之后，还要坚持原来的数字。这是品质问题。
    但是不管是那一种作假，不改正的话，对于党的事业的危害都是很大的。按照这些数字来制定方针、政策、计划，一定要发生严重的问题。这些方针、政策、计划与实际情况不相符合，当然无法实现；一定要实现，就只有采取强迫命令的办法。这样会把人民弄得精疲力尽，十分不满。
    在我们核实特别是在变动某些数字的时候，观潮派、算账派又会乘机反攻。这不要紧。他们的反攻是软弱无力的。常青人民公社在辩论这件事情的时候，观潮派就已经不像春天那样振振有辞了。因为事实早就证明：今年农业生产的大跃进是无可怀疑的了。
    核实，这种工作是非常重要的，不仅常青人民公社应当这样做，其他人民公社也应当这样做。只有在这个基础上，制定出来的明年的增产指标，才是既先进又可靠的指标。
