    Salt Field Plant Control

    The Institute of Marine Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted experiments on the control of plants in salt fields. Seawater晒盐 is the main source of salt in our country. To increase sea salt production, in addition to increasing the area of salt fields and making full use of seawater, an effective method is to accelerate the evaporation rate. However, during the spring and summer seasons, a large number of plants breed in the storage ponds and evaporation ponds, and in severe cases, they can cover 90% of the evaporation area, greatly hindering the evaporation of water in the salt ponds. Most of the plants growing in the salt fields are algae. In the Huaibei and Jiaozhou Bay salt fields, the main ones are *Cladophora*, *Spirogyra*, *Ulva*, *Lyngbya*, *Oscillatoria*, etc., and there is also a higher plant, *Ruppia maritima*. Artificial salvage or draining the salt fields cannot fundamentally eliminate these plants. Chemical drugs have a greater effect, but it is not advisable to use drugs containing organic toxins, because it is difficult to determine the residual amount of organic toxins and their effects on the human body. After many experiments, the Institute of Marine Biology found that chlorine dissolved in water from bleaching powder is the most ideal drug for killing plants in salt fields. Its advantages are: 1. Bleaching powder is cheap and easy to obtain; 2. The effective chlorine content is about 25% to 30%, and the chlorine obtained after dissolution has a great effect on killing plants; 3. The chlorine dissipates into the air 24 hours after application, and the residual amount is extremely small; 4. After the treated brine is made into salt, analysis proves that the salt quality is good; 5. The calcium ions in the bleaching powder solution combine with the sulfate ions in the brine to form calcium sulfate precipitate, which precipitates the original sulfate in the seawater, which is exactly what the salt-making industry requires.

    Currently, the Institute of Marine Biology is cooperating with the Nugukou Salt Industry Research Office in Jiaozhou Bay to conduct large-scale application and prevention experiments.

    盐田植物的防除
    中国科学院海洋生物研究所进行了盐田植物的防除试验。海水晒盐是我国盐的主要来源。要使海盐增产，除了增加盐田面积和充分利用海水外，有效的办法是加快蒸发速度。但是在春夏两季时节，储水池和蒸发池内植物大量繁殖，严重时可盖去蒸发面积90％，大大防碍了盐池中水分的蒸发。在盐田内生长的植物大部是藻类。在淮北及胶州湾盐田主要是刚毛藻、丝藻、浒台、林氏藻、席藻、颤藻等，另外还有一种高等植物川蔓藻。用人工打捞或者盐田放水，不能根本消灭这些植物。化学药品有较大的效果，但不宜施用含有机毒物的药品，因为有机毒物很难测定它的残余量对人体所发生的作用。海洋生物研究所经过多次试验，发现漂白粉溶解于水中的氯是最理想的杀除盐田植物的药品。它的优点是：1、漂白粉便宜易得；2、其中所含的有效氯约为25％至30％，溶解后所得出的氯有很大的杀死植物效能；3、施用二十四小时后氯便散失于空气中，残余量极微；4、经过处理的卤液制成盐后，经过分析证明盐质良好；5、漂白粉溶液中的钙离子与卤液中的硫酸根结合成硫酸钙的沉淀，将海水中原含有的硫酸根析出，正是制盐工业所要求的。
    现在，海洋生物研究所正与胶州湾女姑口盐业研究室合作进行大规模的施用及预防试验。
