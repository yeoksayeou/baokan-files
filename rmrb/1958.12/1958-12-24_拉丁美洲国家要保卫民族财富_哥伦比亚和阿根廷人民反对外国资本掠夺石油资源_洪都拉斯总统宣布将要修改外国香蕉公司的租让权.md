Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: Buenos Aires Dispatch: Argentina's "Times" reported on December 12th that Honduran President Ramón Villeda Morales announced that the concessions of foreign banana companies would soon be modified. Villeda Morales said that the concessions needed to be revised because they were "very old," and the government would reclaim the national interests conceded by groups and parties that betrayed the country.

　　The "Times" pointed out that this was the result of pressure from the Honduran people. The Honduran people demanded the revision of the concessions because these concessions were anti-national and anti-democratic.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Bogota Dispatch: The Colombian people are striving to bring their country's oil entirely under state ownership. The Colombian Petroleum Company, established after the anti-imperialist struggle of the people and the private De Mares Petroleum Company in 1951, has become a symbol of the struggle for national liberation.

　　According to reports, Texaco and Shell both have concessions in Colombia. Imperialist companies export about 80% of the oil they extract, while they only pay 6% in rent. This causes significant economic losses to Colombia. Monopoly capital also ships large quantities of Colombian oil abroad for refining, extracting huge profits from the processing. Colombia, however, has to pay a large sum of US dollars because the oil used domestically must be re-imported. Now these companies are demanding further increases in oil prices, which has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the Colombian people.

　　News reports say that the Colombian people demand the immediate revision of the concessions granted to the oil monopolies and the amendment of the 1953 Petroleum Law, because this law legally guarantees the concessions. The Colombian people believe that driving the oil trusts out of Colombia is a prerequisite for Colombia to achieve economic independence and happiness.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Buenos Aires Dispatch: The Youth Committee of the Argentine Movement for the Defense of Oil recently issued an appeal to defend national oil resources.

　　The appeal, published in the "Times" on December 12th, called on all youth organizations, student organizations, and all Argentine youth to actively participate in this movement, oppose handing over Argentina's black gold to imperialist companies, and demand the abolition of contracts signed with foreign companies that harm national sovereignty and the economy. The appeal also called on all young people to collect signatures for a petition demanding the implementation of these measures, and to distribute slogans, leaflets, and other promotional materials.

    拉丁美洲国家要保卫民族财富
    哥伦比亚和阿根廷人民反对外国资本掠夺石油资源
    洪都拉斯总统宣布将要修改外国香蕉公司的租让权
    据新华社18日讯  布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷“时报”12日报道，洪都拉斯总统拉蒙·维莱达·摩拉勒斯宣布不久即将修改外国香蕉公司的租让权。维莱达·摩拉勒斯说，租让权所以需要重新修订是因为这些租让权“很旧”，政府将收回背叛国家的集团与党派所出让的民族利益。
      “时报”指出，这是洪都拉斯人民施加压力的结果。洪都拉斯人民要求修改租让权是因为这些租让权是反民族和反民主的。
    新华社23日讯  波哥大消息：哥伦比亚人民正在竭力争取把本国石油完全收归国有。在1951年人民同私营的德马雷斯石油公司进行反帝斗争后成立的哥伦比亚石油公司已经成为争取民族解放的标志。
    据报道，德士古石油公司和壳牌石油公司在哥伦比亚都有租让权，帝国主义的公司约出口它们所开采的石油的80％，而它们所付的租金只占6％。这使哥伦比亚在经济上蒙受重大的损失。垄断资本还把大量哥伦比亚的石油运往国外去提炼，从加工中获取巨大利润。而哥伦比亚却因为国内使用的石油必须重新进口而要付出一大笔美元。现在这些公司还在要求进一步提高石油价格，结果引起了哥伦比亚人民的广泛不满。
    消息说，哥伦比亚人民要求立即修订给与石油垄断企业的租让权和修改1953年颁布的石油法令，因为这项法令在法律上保证了租让权。哥伦比亚人民认为，把石油托辣斯赶出哥伦比亚是哥伦比亚取得经济独立和幸福的先决条件。
    新华社23日讯  布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷保卫石油运动青年委员会最近发出了一项保卫国家石油资源的呼吁书。
    “时报”12日刊载的这项呼吁书号召各青年组织、学生组织以及全体阿根廷青年积极参加这一运动，反对把阿根廷的黑金奉送给帝国主义公司，要求废除同外国公司签订的危害国家主权和经济的合同。呼吁书还要求所有的青年为要求实行这些措施的请愿书征集签名，并且散发标语传单等宣传品。
