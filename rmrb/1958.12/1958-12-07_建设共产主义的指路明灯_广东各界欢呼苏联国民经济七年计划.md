Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 6th: People from all walks of life in Guangdong Province warmly cheer the Soviet Union's grand Seven-Year Plan for National Economic Development. On the afternoon of December 5th, the Guangdong Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Guangzhou Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a symposium. Attendees unanimously agreed that the implementation of this plan will not only enable the Soviet Union to enter a communist society more quickly, but will also further strengthen the socialist camp and defeat imperialist countries with an absolute advantage in the peaceful economic competition.

Participants in the symposium included leading figures from various democratic parties and people's organizations, representatives from education, science and technology, culture and art, the medical community, workers, the People's Liberation Army, as well as those who had studied and visited the Soviet Union.

Du Guoxiang, Vice President of the Guangdong Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said at the symposium: The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for National Economic Development is a grand plan for building communism. After the implementation of this plan, the Soviet national economy will greatly prosper, the people's material and cultural life will be greatly improved, and the national defense strength will be greatly enhanced. After seven years, the Soviet Union will surpass the current industrial production level of the United States in the output of some of the most important products. Du Guoxiang also said: The publication of this plan by the Soviet Union makes every Chinese person feel extremely excited and greatly encouraged. Our country's industrial and agricultural production is also leaping forward. We have full confidence in striving to catch up with Britain in the output of major industries in a short period of time. If the Soviet Union surpasses the United States and we surpass Britain, the change in the situation will be even greater.

Zhang Boda, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for National Economic Development is not only a model for all countries to build socialism, but also a guiding light for humanity to transition from socialism to communism, with great international significance. This plan also has extremely important significance in carrying out peaceful economic competition with imperialism. This plan, whether from the scale of construction or the speed of economic development, shows the superiority of the socialist system and marks the powerful strength of the Soviet economy. The publication of this plan is a heavy blow to imperialism.

Other speakers at the symposium expressed their firm support for this plan. They emphasized that the Soviet Union has set a brilliant example in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and is now victoriously marching towards communism. Our people must continue to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, muster greater energy, and accelerate our country's socialist construction. Gao Tianbiao, a worker from the Guangzhou Paper Mill, said that when he was an intern in the Soviet Union, he personally witnessed the great achievements of the Soviet Union's economic and cultural construction and the Soviet workers' selfless communist spirit. He said: "The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan has further encouraged our confidence in building socialism. We Guangzhou workers must strive to learn from the Soviet workers' spirit of selfless labor and their experience in building socialism, constantly improve our scientific and technological and cultural level, and go all out to accelerate our country's socialist construction under the guidance of the general line." Ni Lu, a literary and art worker who had visited the Soviet Union, said that the upsurge in economic construction brought about by the Soviet Seven-Year Plan will inevitably promote the upsurge in culture and art, and it will provide more valuable experience for China's cultural and art circles.

Situ Meifang, Deputy Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, said: The Soviet people and youth have set a brilliant example in socialist and communist construction. The Soviet Communist Youth League members and youth have launched the "Communist Labor Brigade" movement to welcome the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan and the upcoming 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The members of the Communist Youth League and youth in Guangzhou must, under the leadership of the Party, learn from the Soviet youth's communist spirit of selflessness, fearlessness of difficulties, and selfless labor; learn from their advanced experience in improving product quality, so as to accelerate our country's socialist construction. Wu Fanglan, Deputy Director of the Provincial Women's Federation, and Yu Hui, Director of the Municipal Women's Federation, pointed out in their speeches that Guangdong women should take Soviet women as an example, work hard to learn cultural technology, actively labor, and make significant contributions to socialist construction.

    广东各界欢呼苏联国民经济七年计划
    新华社广州6日电  广东省各界人民热烈欢呼苏联发展国民经济的宏伟的七年计划。5日下午，广东省中苏友好协会和广州市中苏友好协会举行座谈会，到会人士一致认为这个计划的实现，不仅使苏联将更快地进入共产主义社会，同时也将进一步增强社会主义阵营的力量，在和平经济竞赛中以绝对优势战胜帝国主义国家。
    参加座谈会的，有各民主党派和人民团体负责人，教育、科学技术、文化艺术、医务界人士和工人、解放军代表以及曾经在苏联学习和访问的人士。
    广东省中苏友好协会副会长杜国庠在座谈会上说：苏联发展国民经济的七年计划是建设共产主义的宏伟计划，实现这个计划后，苏联国民经济将大大繁荣，人民物质生活和文化生活将大大提高，国防力量将大大增强。七年后，苏联在某些最重要的产品的产量方面将超过美国现在的工业生产水平，杜国庠还说：苏联公布这个计划，使我们每一个中国人都感到无比兴奋和巨大鼓舞，我国工农业生产也在大跃进，我们有充分信心争取在短时间内使主要的工业产量赶上英国。苏联超过了美国，我们超过了英国，这时形势的变化就更大了。
    中国人民政治协商会议广东省委员会副主席张?村说：苏联发展国民经济的七年计划不仅是一切国家建设社会主义的榜样，而且是人类由社会主义过渡到共产主义的指路明灯，具有伟大的国际意义。这计划在与帝国主义开展和平经济竞赛上也有极其重大的意义。这个计划，无论从建设的规模或是经济发展的速度来说，都显示了社会主义制度的优越性，标志着苏联经济的强大威力。这个计划的公布，对帝国主义是一个沉重的打击。
    在座谈会上发言的其他人士都表示坚决拥护和支持这个计划。他们强调指出，苏联在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中作出了光辉的榜样，现在正胜利地向着共产主义迈进，我国人民必须继续努力向苏联学习，鼓起更大的干劲，加速我国社会主义建设。广州造纸厂工人高天标说，他在苏联实习时，亲眼见到苏联经济文化建设的伟大成就和苏联工人忘我劳动的共产主义精神。他说：“苏联的七年计划更加鼓舞了我们建设社会主义的信心。我们广州工人必须努力学习苏联工人忘我劳动的精神和建设社会主义的经验，不断提高科学技术和文化水平，鼓足干劲，在总路线的照耀下，加速我国社会主义建设”。曾经到过苏联访问的文艺工作者倪路说，苏联七年计划所带来的经济建设的高涨，必然会促成文化艺术的高涨，它将为中国的文化艺术界提供更多的宝贵经验。
    共青团广州市委副书记司徒梅芳说：苏联人民和青年在社会主义和共产主义建设中作出了光辉的榜样，苏联共青团员和青年们为了迎接苏联七年计划和即将召开的苏联共产党二十一次代表大会，开展了
  “共产主义劳动队”运动。广州市的共青团员和青年们一定要在党的领导下，学习苏联青年大公无私、不怕困难、忘我劳动的共产主义精神；学习他们提高产品质量的先进经验，来加速我国的社会主义建设。省妇联副主任伍方兰和市妇联主任余慧在发言中指出，广东妇女要以苏联妇女为榜样，努力学习文化技术，积极劳动，在社会主义建设中作出重大贡献。
