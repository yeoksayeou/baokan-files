    US Policy Strikes a Blow to Southeast Asian Economies
    Zhang Zhenya
    The capitalist world economic crisis, especially the US economic crisis, and the resulting efforts to shift the crisis to economically underdeveloped countries, have dealt a severe blow to the economies of Southeast Asian countries.
    Depressing the prices of imported raw materials, raising the prices of exported industrial products, using unequal exchanges of "buying cheap and selling dear" to exploit economically underdeveloped countries, and carrying out commodity dumping through "aid" and other means are among the main characteristics of US foreign economic policy. From 1951 to 1957, the United States lowered the price of imported raw materials by 18.3%, while raising the price of exported industrial products by 12%. US monopoly capital earned tens of billions of dollars in extra profits from this unequal exchange, while economically underdeveloped countries suffered heavy losses. In 1957 alone, economically underdeveloped countries lost $4 billion in trade revenue due to the decline in raw material prices, ten times the total amount of "economic aid" provided by the United States to these countries in that year.
    Among the economically underdeveloped countries suffering from US trade plunder, the Southeast Asian countries far away on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean have suffered even heavier blows.
    The eleven countries in this region: India, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Malaya, South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand, due to the impact of falling export raw material prices and increased imports, had a foreign trade deficit of as high as $1.58 billion in 1957, more than ten times the trade deficit of $132.2 million in 1955, resulting in a general phenomenon of financial and foreign exchange depletion in these countries. For example, India's trade income has lost more than 180 million rupees in the first half of this year due to the fall in raw material prices. Its foreign exchange reserves have decreased by 72% from the beginning of 1957 to August 1958. Indonesia's National Bank's foreign exchange reserves shrank to only 7.5% of currency issuance in August this year, while the statutory minimum is 20%.
    As for Pakistan, the Philippines, and other countries bound by US military treaties and closely related to the United States economically, the deterioration of their economic situation is even more significant. Pakistan's foreign trade changed from a surplus of 410 million rupees in 1955 to a deficit of 480 million rupees in 1957. Its foreign exchange reserves decreased by 20% in 1957, and by another half from January to August 1958, leaving only 500 million rupees. During the above period, due to the continued increase in military expenditure, Pakistan's budget deficit for the 1957 fiscal year increased threefold compared with the previous year (excluding the issuance of public bonds and foreign aid income), and the budget deficit for the 1958 fiscal year increased by 50% compared with the previous year. As a result of the Pakistani government issuing large amounts of currency to make up for the deficit, the price of daily necessities in the country rose by 60% from July 1956 to June 1957 alone. Since 60% of the Philippines' exports depend on the United States, its trade deficit is also particularly serious. In 1957 alone, its foreign exchange reserves shrank by 56% due to trade deficits.
    In Malaya and Thailand, in addition to the financial emergency caused by the sharp decline in exports, there has also been a serious crisis of domestic production stagnation, business closures, and mass unemployment.
    The long-term rule of imperialism in the past and the continued plunder by foreign monopoly capital have left the vast majority of countries in Southeast Asia in a state of single economic production to this day, requiring them to rely on exporting several raw materials and agricultural crops to North America and Western Europe in exchange for industrial products or food. Eight major export raw materials, namely rubber, rice, copra, tea, cotton, jute, sugar, and tin, account for more than 50% of the total exports of these countries. Many countries mainly export two or three raw materials. For example, according to materials from the "International Financial Statistics" magazine, from 1948 to 1956, rice alone accounted for 78% of Burma's exports; rubber and tin accounted for 83% of Malaya's exports; tea and rubber accounted for 80% of Ceylon's exports; rice and rubber accounted for 75% of Thailand's exports; cotton and jute accounted for 74% of Pakistan's exports; rubber and rice accounted for 71% of South Vietnam's exports; and rubber, petroleum, and tin accounted for 70% of Indonesia's exports; copra (including coconut oil), sugar, and hemp accounted for 69% of the Philippines' exports. At the same time, trade income accounts for a very high proportion of these countries' national income. For example, trade income accounts for 60% of Malaya's national income, 40% for Burma, 33% for Thailand, 25% for Indonesia, and 23% for the Philippines. Therefore, every fluctuation in the price of raw materials in the international market has historically caused huge losses to the national economies of these countries. For example, every one-cent drop in the price of natural rubber per pound on the international market causes Indonesia to lose $15 million a year, and Malaya to lose $13 million a year. Since the United States purchases more than half of Southeast Asia's tin, sugar, and coconut products, and one-third of its rubber, the United States' trade share in this region exceeds that of any other country. This allows the United States to manipulate the prices of Southeast Asian export raw materials, thereby exploiting these countries.
    Rubber is the largest export item in Southeast Asia, often accounting for one-third of its total exports. 95% of the world's natural rubber comes from Indonesia, Malaya, Thailand, Ceylon, and Cambodia. But as early as 1956, when the US automobile industry showed instability, it reduced imports of rubber and rubber products by 10%, causing rubber prices to fall by 15%. In 1957, in order to further depress prices, the United States once again cut rubber imports by 10%, causing Southeast Asian rubber prices to fall another 16% from March of last year to March of this year. As a result, Southeast Asian rubber-producing countries have suffered heavy blows in terms of both export quantity and export price, and many rubber plantations have gone bankrupt. Malaya's five-year development plan, which began in 1956, has had to be shelved due to financial depletion. Although Thailand's rubber exports increased by 5,600 tons in the first half of this year, the value dropped by 9%. Ceylon's rubber exports decreased by 13%, but the value decreased by 28%.
    The United States has also implemented ruthless measures to reduce imports of tin, another important raw material imported from Southeast Asia. As everyone knows, Malaya, Indonesia, and Thailand are the world's tin production centers, producing two-thirds of the world's tin, with Malaya producing 60,000 tons of tin annually, the world's largest tin producer. However, this region consumes less than one-tenth of the world's tin. Half of the tin it produces is exported to the United States. But when world tin production surged in 1957, the United States, which consumes 40% of the tin in the capitalist world, suddenly cut its tin purchases by 20%, causing great difficulties for Southeast Asian countries and seriously threatening the lives of nearly 100,000 tin workers here. Thailand's tin production has been reduced by 40%, and the situation in Malaya is similar.
    In addition to trying its best to reduce rubber and tin imports and depress their prices, the United States also uses the method of dumping surplus products to strike a blow to the economies of countries in this region. Rice and cotton are major export products of Southeast Asia. The main exporting countries for the former are Burma and Thailand, and the main exporting countries for the latter are Pakistan and India. But in 1957, the United States' agricultural product exports to Asia increased by 22%. Agricultural products imported into India through "US aid" alone tripled. Indirectly, it has robbed Burma and Thailand of a portion of the rice market in India, Japan, Indonesia, Malaya, and the Philippines. The large-scale dumping of surplus US cotton has also caused extremely heavy blows to Southeast Asian cotton-exporting countries. In 1957, US cotton exports increased nearly twofold compared with the previous year, with a total export value of more than $1 billion, far exceeding foreign consumption of US cotton. Under the circumstances that all cotton-exporting countries in the world have suffered, Pakistan, where cotton has long accounted for 41% of exports, also saw its export volume drop by one-third in the past year. The price of exported cotton fell by 11%. The decline in cotton prices alone cost India 11.8 million rupees in the first half of this year.
    As for other important raw materials exported from Southeast Asia, such as tea, copra, jute, and sugar, they have all fallen into the predicament of sharp declines in exports and falling prices. According to materials from the International Monetary Fund, in 1957 alone, the fall in raw material prices cost six Southeast Asian countries—India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ceylon, Malaya, and the Philippines—$1.5 billion. This figure is equal to two-thirds of the total annual budget appropriation made by these countries in 1957 for their national economic plans.
    The serious damage suffered by the economies of Southeast Asian countries is having an extremely drastic impact on the economic construction plans of those countries in this region that are following the independent development of their national economies; and in those countries that are bound by layers of US military blocs, military agreements, and various unequal economic and trade treaties, the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and US imperialism are also deepening day by day.
    The recent "Colombo Plan" conference held in Seattle, like the situation reflected by the "Committee of Twenty-One" meeting in the Americas, showed great dissatisfaction among economically underdeveloped countries with the US economic plunder policy.
    Even in the Philippines, which is extremely tightly controlled by the United States and heavily dependent on the United States economically, this dissatisfaction is constantly growing. On December 6, Philippine Senator Recto openly pointed out: "The economic interests of the United States are hostile to the industrialization of the Philippines," and "If the current Philippine-US relations continue, the Philippines will be economically and politically dependent on the United States forever." On November 8, Philippine Labor Minister Castano also said at a public gathering: "As long as the Philippine peso (Philippine currency) is linked to the US dollar, the economic situation in the Philippines will never improve." Sinko, the head of the Philippine delegation attending the "Colombo Plan" conference, pointed out more specifically: "The adverse effects of the foreign and domestic trade policies of developed countries (mainly referring to the United States) often negate the progress being made by poor countries—whether or not they receive foreign aid."
    Southeast Asian countries have successively demanded that the United States stabilize raw material prices and provide effective economic "aid." However, they have not received a favorable response from the United States. On the contrary, Washington is using the economic difficulties of Southeast Asian countries to carry out "cold war" activities and to open the door for US private capital so as to further expand the economic control of US monopoly groups. Regardless of the consequences of US "aid" and private investment, the very real problem at present is: according to UN estimates, a mere 4% drop in the price of exported goods from economically underdeveloped countries will offset all the funds provided by the United States and its allies to these countries, and in the past year alone, the export prices of raw materials from these economically underdeveloped countries have fallen by 11%. From this, it is not difficult to see the essence of Washington's policy of economic plunder, which has always been disguised as "aiding economically underdeveloped countries" and "economic cooperation."

    美国政策对东南亚国家经济的打击
    张振亚
    资本主义世界经济危机，特别是美国经济危机，和它们竭力向经济不发达国家转嫁危机的结果，已给东南亚国家的经济带来了严重的打击。
    压低进口原料价格、提高出口工业品价格，用“贱买贵卖”的不等价交换来压榨经济不发达国家，并以“援助”等方式实行商品倾销，是美国对外经济政策的主要特点之一。从1951年起到1957年，美国把进口原料价格压低了18.3％，但出口工业品价格却提高了12％。美国垄断资本从这一不等价交换中多赚得了成百亿美元的利润，而经济不发达国家则遭到惨重的损失。1957年仅因原料价格的下跌，经济不发达国家在贸易收入上就损失了四十亿美元，十倍于美国在这一年向这些国家所提供的全部“经济援助”。
    在遭受美国贸易掠夺的经济不发达国家中，远在太平洋西岸的东南亚国家所受的打击更是十分沉重。
    这个地区的十一个国家：印度、锡兰、缅甸、印度尼西亚、柬埔寨、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、马来亚、南越、老挝和泰国，因受出口原料价格下跌和进口增加的影响，1957年的对外贸易逆差高达十五亿八千万美元，竟比1955年这些国家的贸易逆差一亿三千二百万美元增加了十倍还多，造成了这些国家财政和外汇枯竭的普遍现象。如印度的贸易收入今年上半年因原料价格下跌已损失了一亿八千多万卢比。它的外汇储备从1957年初到1958年8月损失了72％。印度尼西亚国家银行的外汇储备，今年8月已萎缩到只占通货发行量的7.5％，而法定最低额则是20％。
    至于巴基斯坦、菲律宾等受美国军事条约束缚和同美国经济关系密切的国家，经济情况的恶化就更显著。巴基斯坦的对外贸易从1955年的出超四亿一千万卢比变为1957年的入超四亿八千万卢比。它的外汇储备在1957年就减少了20％，从1958年1月到8月外汇储备又减少了一半，只剩下五亿卢比。在上述时期中，由于军费仍在增加，巴基斯坦1957财政年度的预算赤字竟比前一年增加了三倍（除去发行公债和外援收入），1958财政年度的预算赤字又比上年度增加了50％。巴基斯坦政府为弥补赤字而大量发行通货的结果，国内日用品价格仅在1956年7月到1957年6月就上涨了60％。菲律宾由于60％的出口依靠美国，因此贸易逆差也特别严重，仅在1957年它的外汇储备就因贸易入超减缩了56％。
    在马来亚和泰国，除了出口锐减引起的财政紧急状态以外，还出现了国内生产停顿、企业纷纷倒闭和大量失业的严重危机。
    帝国主义过去的长期统治，外国垄断资本的继续进行掠夺，使东南亚地区的绝大多数国家直到今天仍然停留在单一经济生产的状态，需要依靠向北美和西欧输出几种原料和农作物来换取工业品或粮食。橡胶、大米、椰干、茶叶、棉花、黄麻、糖和锡八种主要出口原料就占这些国家出口总值的50％以上。很多国家都是以出口两三种原料为主。例如根据“国际金融统计”杂志的材料，从1948年到1956年，仅大米一项就占缅甸出口的78％；橡胶和锡占马来亚出口的83％；茶叶和橡胶占去锡兰出口的80％；大米和橡胶占了泰国出口的75％；棉花和黄麻占巴基斯坦出口的74％；橡胶和大米占南越出口的71％；橡胶、石油和锡占印度尼西亚出口的70％；椰干（包括椰油）、糖和麻占菲律宾出口的69％。与此同时，贸易收入在这些国家的国民收入中也占有极高的比例。例如，马来亚的贸易收入占国民收入的60％，缅甸占40％，泰国占33％，印度尼西亚占25％，菲律宾占23％。因此，历来国际市场上原料价格的每一次波动，都会使这些国家的国民经济受到巨大损失。譬如，国际市场上每磅天然橡胶只要下跌美元一分，就会使印度尼西亚一年损失一千五百万美元，马来亚一年损失一千三百万美元。由于东南亚过半数的锡、糖和椰产物以及三分之一的橡胶都由美国所收购，因此，美国在这个地区的贸易比重，超过任何其他国家。这就使美国能够操纵东南亚出口原料的价格，从而对这些国家进行压榨。
    橡胶是东南亚地区的第一项大宗出口，经常占这里出口总值的三分之一。世界95％的天然橡胶产自印度尼西亚、马来亚、泰国、锡兰和柬埔寨。但是早在1956年美国汽车工业呈现不稳时，就把橡胶和橡胶制品的进口减少了10％。使橡胶价格下跌了15％。1957年为了再压低价格，美国再一次削减了橡胶进口10％，于是使东南亚的胶价从去年3月到今年3月又跌落了16％。这样，东南亚产橡胶国家无论在出口数量或出口价格上都遭受到惨重打击，许多橡胶园陷于破产。马来亚从1956年开始的五年发展计划因财政枯竭已不得不宣布搁置。泰国橡胶出口虽然今年上半年增加了五千六百吨，但按价值计算却下跌了9％。锡兰橡胶出口量下降了13％，但按价值计算竟下跌了28％。
    美国从东南亚进口的另一项重要原料锡，也实行了削减进口的凶狠手段。大家知道，马来亚、印度尼西亚和泰国是世界产锡中心，它们生产着世界三分之二的锡，其中马来亚年产锡六万吨，是世界最大产锡国。但是，这个地区消费着不到世界十分之一的锡。它所产的一半的锡是输往美国。可是当1957年世界锡产量激增的时候，消费着资本主义世界40％的锡的美国却突然把对锡的收购量削减了20％，使东南亚国家遭到了极大困难，使这里近十万名锡工的生活受到严重威胁。泰国的锡竟减产达40％，马来亚的情况亦相类似。
    美国除了竭力削减橡胶和锡的进口，并压低它们的价格以外，还用倾销剩余产品的办法来打击这一地区的国家的经济。大米和棉花是东南亚主要出口品。前者的主要输出国是缅甸和泰国，后者的主要输出国是巴基斯坦和印度。但是1957年美国对亚洲的农产品输出却增加了22％。仅是通过“美援”向印度输入的农产品就增加了三倍。无形中抢走了缅甸和泰国在印度、日本、印度尼西亚、马来亚、菲律宾的一部分大米市场。美国过剩棉花的大量倾销使东南亚棉花出口国家遭受的打击也异常沉重。1957年美棉出口比前一年增加几近一倍，出口总值达到十亿美元以上，远远超过国外对美棉的消耗量。在世界所有棉花出口国家都一律遭受打击的情况下，长期以来棉花占出口41％的巴基斯坦，在去年一年中出口量也下降了三分之一。出口棉花价格则下跌达11％。单是棉价的下跌在今年上半年就使印度损失了一千一百八十万卢比。
    至于东南亚出口的其他重要原料如茶叶、椰干、黄麻和糖等也莫不陷入出口锐减、价格下跌的困境中。据国际货币基金组织的材料，1957年单是原料价格下跌就使东南亚六个国家——印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、锡兰、马来亚、菲律宾——损失了十五亿美元。这个数字等于这几个国家1957年为它们的国民经济计划所作的年度预算拨款总和的三分之二。
    东南亚国家经济遭受的这种严重损害，正在给这一地区那些沿着民族经济的独立发展的国家的经济建设计划，带来极其剧烈的影响；而在那些被美国军事集团、军事协定以及经济贸易上种种不平等条约的层层束缚的国家中，民族资产阶级同美帝国主义的矛盾也在日益深刻化。
    最近在西雅图举行的“科伦坡计划”会议，如同美洲“二十一国委员会”会议所反映的情况一样，经济不发达国家对美国经济掠夺政策表现了极大的不满。
    甚至是在美国控制极其厉害、对美国的经济依赖极深的菲律宾，这种不满情绪也不断增长起来。12月6日菲律宾参议员雷克托就公开指出：“美国的经济利益同菲律宾的工业化是敌对的”，“目前菲美关系如果继续下去，菲律宾将在经济上和政治上永远依赖美国”。11月8日菲律宾劳工部长卡斯塔诺在一次公共集会上也说：“只要菲律宾的比索（菲币）同美元联系着，菲律宾的经济情况就永远不会有改进”。出席“科伦坡计划”会议的菲律宾代表团团长辛科更具体指出：“各发达国家（主要指美国）的内外贸易政策的不利影响常常会使贫穷国家——不管有无外国援助——正在取得的进展化为乌有。”
    东南亚国家纷纷要求美国稳定原料价格，提供有效的经济“援助”。但是，并没有得到美国方面的有利反应。相反地，华盛顿正在利用东南亚国家的经济困难，进行“冷战”活动，并要它们为美国私人资本敞开大门，以便进一步扩大美国垄断集团的经济控制。姑不论美国的“援助”和私人投资会带来什么后果，目前十分现实的问题是：根据联合国的估计，世界经济不发达国家出口商品的价格只要跌落4％，就会抵消美国及其盟国向这些国家提供的全部资金，而仅在去年，这些经济不发达国家的原料出口价格就下跌了11％。从这里也就不难看出华盛顿一直打着的“援助经济不发达国家”和“经济合作”的假招牌进行经济掠夺的政策的实质了。
