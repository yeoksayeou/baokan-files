    Delivering Goods to the Countryside
    Zhao Wencan, Lutou, Zaoyang, Hubei
  The cadre style has greatly changed,
  It’s hard to find a single idle person everywhere,
  Busy with work and then engaging in production,
  Delivering goods to the countryside, right to the fields,
  Clack, clack, clack,
  Some pushing, some carrying,
  Means of production and consumer goods,
  Bringing all kinds of goods.
  Aunt Zhang buys a new handkerchief,
  Uncle Li buys a pack of good cigarettes,
  In the past, it was twenty li to the market,
  Now delivery is so convenient,
  Putting the carrying pole on the edge of the field,
  Unsheathing the sickle and going to the fields,
  Both selling goods and laboring,
  Men, women, old and young all praise it.

    送货下乡
    湖北枣阳鹿头  赵文灿
  干部作风大转变，
  处处难找一人闲，
  忙罢工作搞生产，
  送货下乡到田间，
  咯支支，咯支支，
  推的推来担的担，
  生产资料消费品，
  样样货物带的全。
  张大嫂买条新手巾，
  李大叔买盒好纸烟，
  过去赶集二十里，
  现在送货真方便，
  挑子放在地头上，
  解起镰刀下了田，
  又销货来又劳动，
  男女老少都称赞。
