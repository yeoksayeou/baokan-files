    Carrying a Conspiracy to Undermine the Unity of the Arab People
    Rountree Begins Activities in the Middle East

    (Reported by this newspaper) U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree has ended his visit to Lebanon and departed for Jordan on the 10th. This U.S. Middle East "expert," known for plotting conspiracies in the Middle East, set out on the 6th for a "visit" to the Middle East lasting about half a month. The countries he is scheduled to visit include Lebanon, Jordan, the United Arab Republic, and Iraq.

    Regarding the purpose of Rountree's trip, the U.S. State Department revealed that it was to "win friends, contain communism, and provide financial and technical assistance to those countries that cooperate with the United States." However, the people of the Middle East will not forget that in the past, "special envoys" such as Richards and Murphy "visited" the Middle East with similar banners, but these "special envoys" carried in their briefcases despicable political conspiracies to undermine the national independence movements of the Middle East. Of course, Rountree's trip will be no exception.

    What is the true purpose of Rountree's trip to the Middle East? Many newspapers in Middle Eastern countries pointed out that the main purpose is to divide the unity between the people of the Middle East, attempting to force the newly established Republic of Iraq to bow to the United States. Beirut's "Al-Watan" stated that his trip aimed to "find ways to isolate Iraq among other Arab countries." Damascus's "Al-Nour" also pointed out that the United States is attempting to undermine the independence of the Republic of Iraq and destroy the victories achieved by the Iraqi people. This statement is completely justified. United Press International revealed in a dispatch that the United States would try to find out whether Qasim "intends to continue Iraq's participation in the Baghdad Pact" and whether he "hopes to accept military assistance under the agreement concluded between the United States and the former regime."

    However, Rountree's visit began with an ominous sign. On the 8th, the same day he arrived at his first destination, Beirut, Lebanese Prime Minister Karami announced that Lebanon refused to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." On the same day, Rountree held talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Karami, Foreign Minister Uwayni, and President Chehab. U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock also participated in the talks. The content of the talks was not disclosed. According to the Arab News Agency, Karami told reporters after the talks that it was "completely impossible" for Lebanon to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine" today.

    Will Rountree's future encounters be smoother? It seems that the situation is unfavorable for him. In the Middle East, many newspapers in Beirut, Baghdad, Cairo, and Damascus have published commentaries condemning Rountree's conspiratorial activities. The people of the Middle East, who have considerable experience in dealing with U.S. imperialism, undoubtedly know how to smash Rountree's conspiracies.

### 带着破坏阿拉伯人民团结的阴谋  朗特里在中东开始活动

    带着破坏阿拉伯人民团结的阴谋
    朗特里在中东开始活动
    本报讯  美国助理国务卿朗特里已经结束了在黎巴嫩的访问，在10日动身去约旦。这个以在中东策划阴谋著名的美国中东问题“专家”是在6日启程到中东地区作为期半个月左右的“访问”活动的。他预定访问的国家有：黎巴嫩、约旦、阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克等。
    对朗特里此行的目的，据美国国务院透露，是要“赢取朋友，遏止共产主义，并向那些同美国合作的国家提供财政和技术援助”。但是，中东的人民不会忘记，过去理查兹、墨菲这些“特使”“访问”中东，也都打着类似的招牌，但是这些“特使”的皮包里所带的却是破坏中东民族独立运动的卑鄙政治阴谋。当然朗特里此行也不会例外。
    朗特里中东之行的真实目的是什么呢？中东国家的很多报纸指出，主要是分化中东人民之间的团结，企图借此迫使新生的伊拉克共和国向美国屈膝。贝鲁特的“祖国呼声报”就说，他此行目的是“设法使伊拉克在其他的阿拉伯国家中孤立起来”。大马士革“光明报”也指出，美国是企图破坏伊拉克共和国的独立，并摧毁伊拉克人民所取得的胜利。这种说法是完全有根据的。美国合众国际社在一则电讯里就曾经透露：美国将设法了解卡塞姆“是否打算使伊拉克继续参加巴格达条约”以及他“是否希望根据美国同前政权缔结的协定接受军事援助。”
    但是，朗特里的访问一开始就碰到不吉之兆。8日，在他到达第一个目的地——贝鲁特的同一天，黎巴嫩总理卡拉米便宣布黎巴嫩拒绝接受“艾森豪威尔主义。”当天，朗特里先后同黎巴嫩总理卡拉米、外交部长乌埃尼、总统谢哈布举行会谈。美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克也参加了会谈。会谈的内容没有透露。据阿拉伯通讯社报道，卡拉米在会谈后对记者说，对黎巴嫩来说，今天要接受“艾森豪威尔主义”“是完全不可能的了”。
    朗特里以后的遭遇是否会顺利些呢？看来，情况对他是不妙的。在中东，贝鲁特、巴格达、开罗和大马士革的很多报纸已纷纷发表评论，谴责朗特里的阴谋活动。同美帝国主义打交道已经很有经验的中东人民，无疑是懂得怎样粉碎朗特里的阴谋的。
