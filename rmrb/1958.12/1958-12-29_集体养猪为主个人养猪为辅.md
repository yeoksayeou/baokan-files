Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 28th: Hong'an County, Hubei Province, is developing pig production by walking on two legs, with collective production by the commune as the primary method and individual production by members as the secondary method, and has achieved good results.

	This year, pig production in Hong'an County has greatly developed compared to last year. According to incomplete statistics, the total pig production in the county reached more than 280,000 head, averaging more than 3.2 head per household, an increase of more than 1.1 times compared to last year. Among the nearly 400 production teams under the various people's communes, 74 teams averaged more than 5 to 10 head of pigs per household, and one team in the Jiansu People's Commune averaged nearly 22 head of pigs per household. The county transferred more than 39,800 head of fattened pigs, exceeding the target by 4.8% and completing the task ahead of schedule.

	Due to the large-scale development of pig production, the county transferred a large number of fattened pigs this year, powerfully supporting industrial bases such as Wuhan. The county accumulated more than 50 million dan of fertilizer due to pig raising. In addition, the peasant masses greatly increased their income due to pig raising, averaging more than 38 yuan per household, and meat consumption also increased compared to last year.

	In order to promote the experience of Hong'an County, the Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Huanggang Administrative Office recently held an experience exchange meeting in Hong'an County.

    集体养猪为主个人养猪为辅
    据新华社武汉28日电  湖北省红安县用两条腿走路的方法，以公社集体生产为主，社员个人生产为辅，发展生猪生产，已经收到较好的效果。
    今年，红安县的生猪生产较去年有了很大的发展。据不完全统计，全县生猪生产量共达二十八万多头，平均每户三点二头强，比去年增加了一点一倍还多。各人民公社所属的近四百个中队中，每户平均达五头到十头以上的有七十四个，建苏人民公社有一个中队每户平均有生猪近二十二头。全县上调肥猪三万九千八百多头，超额4.8％提前完成任务。
    由于生猪生产的大发展，今年全县上调大批肥猪，有力地支援了武汉等工业基地。全县因养猪增积的肥料达五千多万担。此外，农民群众因养猪还大大地增加了收入，平均每户合三十八元之多，肉食量也比去年增长。
    为了推广红安县的经验，中共黄冈地委和黄冈专署最近在红安县召开了经验交流会。
