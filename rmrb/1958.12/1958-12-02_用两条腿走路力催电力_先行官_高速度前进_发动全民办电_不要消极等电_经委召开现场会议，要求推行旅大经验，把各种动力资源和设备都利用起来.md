Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, December 1st: The State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently jointly convened a nine-day on-site meeting in Lüda City on nationwide power generation. The meeting proposed launching a nationwide power generation movement this winter and next spring, allowing the "Pioneer Official" of electricity to mount the "small-scale, indigenous groups'" steed, galloping alongside the "large-scale, foreign groups" to advance at high speed, ensuring an even greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

More than 800 representatives from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as central industrial departments and relevant universities, attended the meeting. They listened to representatives from Lüda City introduce their experience in nationwide power generation and visited some of the local power stations built by the masses. They unanimously agreed that Lüda City is currently a red banner for nationwide power generation.

The meeting pointed out that this year, the speed of power station design and construction has accelerated several times compared to last year; the equipment utilization rate of existing power plants has also greatly improved. However, the development of the power industry is still far from meeting the needs of the people's commune movement and the mass movement to vigorously develop industry with steel as the key link. Currently, severe power shortages have emerged in Northeast China, Southwest China, and Shandong Province; other regions will also experience power shortages in the future. The meeting believes that to develop the power industry at high speed and give full play to the "Pioneer Official's" enormous role, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and learn to walk on two legs in power generation: on the one hand, the power industry departments must vigorously develop "large-scale, foreign groups," making every effort to accelerate the construction of modern large-scale power stations so that they can be put into operation and generate electricity as soon as possible; on the other hand, it is also necessary to take the path of "small-scale, indigenous groups," mobilizing the masses from all aspects of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers to launch a nationwide power generation movement.

Can power generation follow the path of "small-scale, indigenous groups"? Will the masses be able to generate electricity? Many vivid facts provided by Lüda representatives at the meeting answered this question affirmatively. Since August this year, the power supply in the Lüda area has been insufficient, and industrial production was once greatly affected. Some light industrial factories had to stop production due to lack of electricity. However, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the masses of the city broke the mysterious view of power generation, criticized the one-sided ideas of believing in large over small, believing in foreign over indigenous, and thinking that "small-scale, indigenous groups" power generation is uneconomical. They used scattered equipment and simple equipment manufactured by indigenous methods to seek power from water, fire, wind, and biogas. Without asking the state for any investment, they built power plants with a total installed capacity of over 100,100 kilowatts in three months. Among them, 49,600 kilowatts have been completed and put into operation, generating 337,000 kilowatt-hours per day. Currently, 75 factories, government offices, schools, shops, and other units in the city have achieved power self-sufficiency; moreover, some units have also input surplus power into the power grid to support national production and construction. The meeting called on all regions, especially factories and mining enterprises in large and medium-sized cities and industrial areas across the country, to seriously study the experience of Lüda City, take the lead in mobilizing the masses to generate electricity, and rapidly launch a nationwide power generation movement.

After summarizing the experiences of Lüda and other regions, the meeting believes that the main advantages of taking the path of "small-scale, indigenous groups" to launch nationwide power generation are: small and indigenous power generation equipment is relatively simple and easy to manufacture; the technology is simple and easy to master; tools and materials can be obtained locally, and installation and construction can be adapted to local conditions; the power required for power stations, wind, water, coal, and gas, can be chosen freely; investment is small and the speed is fast, and the masses from all aspects of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers can participate in it. This combination of small, indigenous, and mass participation can utilize various power resources and power equipment, thereby rapidly changing the face of the power industry.

The meeting believes that the current mass mobilization for power generation should promote the practice of learning, doing, and improving simultaneously, calling on the masses to build more and build faster, first achieving popularization, and then gradually consolidating and improving on the basis of popularization. In power generation, it is necessary to oppose the mentality of dependence, emphasize simplicity, self-reliance, self-management, and self-use, and advocate mutual cooperation, taking the initiative to help power generation units overcome the equipment, material, and technology hurdles. The fundamental way to overcome the three hurdles is to mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technological revolution, and advocate the use of more indigenous methods, more substitutes (substitute materials and equipment), and diversification (all things that can generate electricity and power should be used) to generate electricity.

Cheng Mingsheng, Deputy Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power, pointed out in his summary report at the meeting that in the current development of the power industry, attention must be paid to the combination of seven aspects, namely, the combination of "large-scale, foreign" and "small-scale, indigenous"; the combination of expanding sources and reducing consumption; the combination of hydropower, thermal power, wind power, and biogas; the combination of running power plants and running power machinery; the combination of tapping existing power and power equipment and manufacturing new power and power equipment; the combination of obtaining materials locally and comprehensive utilization; the combination of consolidating and developing self-supplied power plants and using power grid supply. Cheng Mingsheng finally requested that the electric power departments at all levels, under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, must break with conventions and overcome conservative thinking in carrying out the nationwide power generation movement, resolutely establish the concept of trusting the masses, actively support the initiatives of the masses, and actively help the masses solve the technical difficulties encountered in power generation.

    用两条腿走路力催电力“先行官”高速度前进
    发动全民办电  不要消极等电
    经委召开现场会议，要求推行旅大经验，把各种动力资源和设备都利用起来
    新华社旅大1日电  国家经济委员会和水利电力部最近在旅大市联合召开了为期九天的全民办电现场会议。会议提出今冬明春开展一个全民办电运动，让电力“先行官”跨上“小土群”的骏马，同“大洋群”并驾齐驱高速前进，保证工农业生产的更大跃进。
    参加会议的各省、市、自治区，以及中央各工业部门、有关高等院校的八百多名代表，听了旅大市代表介绍的全民办电的经验，参观了群众办起的一些土电站。他们一致认为旅大市是目前全国群众办电的一面红旗。
    会议指出，今年以来，电站的设计和施工速度，比去年加快了数倍；现有电厂的设备利用率也比过去大大提高。但是，电力工业的发展还远不能适应人民公社化运动和以钢为纲全民大办工业的群众运动的需要。目前，东北、西南和山东等地，已经出现严重缺电的情况；其他一些地区，今后也将会出现缺电情况。会议认为，要高速度发展电力工业，使之发挥“先行官”的巨大作用，必须坚决贯彻“土”“洋”并举的方针，在办电中学会两条腿走路：一方面，电力工业部门必须大搞“大洋群”，尽一切努力加快现代化大型电站的建设，使其尽快地运转发电；另一方面，还必须走“小土群”的道路，动员工农商学兵各方面的群众，开展全民办电运动。
    办电能不能走“小土群”的道路？群众会不会办电？旅大代表在会上提供的许多生动的事实，肯定地回答了这个问题。从今年8月份以来，旅大地区电力供应不足，工业生产曾经一度受到很大影响，一些轻工业工厂因为缺电不得不停止生产。但是，全市人民群众在中共市委的领导下，破除办电的神秘观点，批判了信大不信小、信洋不信土，以及认为“小土群”办电不经济等片面思想，利用各地散存的设备和土法制造的简易设备，向水、火、风和沼气要电源，没有向国家要一点投资，三个月中就办起设备容量共达十万零一千多瓩的电，其中已经建成投入运行发电的有四万九千六百瓩，日发电三十三万七千多度。目前，全市已经有七十五个工厂、机关、学校、商店等单位，做到了电力自给自足；而且，有些单位还把多余的电力输入电力网支援国家生产建设。会议要求各地，特别是全国各大中城市和工业地区的厂矿企业，认真学习旅大市的经验，带头发动群众办电，迅速开展全民办电运动。
    会议在总结了旅大和其他地区的经验以后，认为走“小土群”的道路发动全民办电，主要的好处是：小的、土的发电设备比较简单，易于制造；技术简单，易于掌握；工具、材料可以就地取材，安装建设可以因地制宜；电站所需要的动力，风、水、煤、气，任人选择；投资少、速度快，工农商学兵各方面群众都能插手办。这样一小、一土、一群，就能够把各种动力资源、各种动力设备都利用起来，从而迅速改变电力工业的面貌。
    会议认为，目前发动群众办电，应该提倡边干边学边提高的作法，号召群众多办快办，首先达到普及，在普及的基础上再逐步巩固提高。在办电中，要反对依赖思想，强调因陋就简，自力更生，自办自用自管，提倡互相协作，主动帮助办电单位过好设备关、材料关和技术关。过好三关的根本办法，是发动群众，大闹技术革命，提倡用多土、多代（代用材料和设备）、多样化（所有可以发电、作动力的东西都利用起来）的方法办电。
    水利电力部副部长程明升在会议的总结报告中指出：在目前发展电力工业中，必须注意七个方面的结合，即“大洋”同“小土”相结合；开源同节流相结合；水力火力风力和沼气相结合，办电力同办动力相结合，挖掘现有的电力、动力设备同制造新的电力、动力设备相结合；就地取材同综合利用相结合；巩固发展自备电厂同使用电网供电相结合。程明升最后要求各级电业部门在各省市委的领导下，在开展全民办电运动中必须打破陈规旧律，克服保守思想，坚决树立相信群众的观念，积极支持群众的创举，并且积极帮助群众解决在办电中所遇到的技术困难。
