Women Conquer the Cultural Barrier
·Our Correspondent·

Learning All the Way to Beijing

Du Yuanxian, the mother of the famous young peasant scientist Wang Baojing, also came to Beijing this time to attend the National Women's Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction.

Du Yuanxian, fifty-two years old, learned 1,500 characters in less than two years. She also organized thirteen old women to study together and helped everyone get rid of illiteracy. Because she studied well, she was elected as a representative to attend this conference of women activists. On the way from Shaanxi to Beijing, this old lady still insisted on studying. Her pockets were filled with pencils and notebooks, and she took them out to study whenever she had time. No matter who she met, she would promote the benefits of learning culture. Coincidentally, Zhang Qiuxiang, a cotton-growing expert, and two other old women came to Beijing to attend the meeting with her. They had just started learning culture. Du Yuanxian volunteered to be a teacher and organized them to study together. They didn't bring literacy textbooks, so Du Yuanxian compiled a rhyme: "Culture is like a mountain of treasures, all kinds of science are on top. If you want to go up the mountain to get treasures, you must first pass the illiteracy barrier." She wrote this rhyme on paper and gave a copy to each of them. They learned to read and write it along the way, and before the train arrived in Beijing, they had all learned the rhyme.

After arriving in Beijing, they happened to live in the same room again, and Du Yuanxian compiled another song praising the people's commune and taught them to learn it. They quickly learned it.

An Illiterate Person Becomes a Popular and Highly Praised Civil School Teacher

"Speaking of Dengta, talking about Dengta, the teachers of the Fifth Team are top-notch. Originally, she was illiterate, but she learned 1,800 characters in two weeks. The whole team elected her as a teacher, teaching culture day and night. The commune cadres and members support her, she is proficient in both literacy and martial arts, and everyone praises her."

After visiting the Dengta People's Commune in Changyang County, the Anti-Illiteracy Visiting Group of Dangyang County, Hubei Province, wrote this poem to praise Hu Shixiu, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Dengta Commune. Originally, Hu Shixiu learned 1,800 characters in fifteen days of hard work and became a civil school teacher.

When Hu Shixiu first became a civil teacher, some people said with a contemptuous tone: "A newly sprouted yellow hair, how can she teach, she will only harm people." But under the education and support of the Party and Youth League organizations, she insisted on teaching. In order to ensure that all students could go to school, she helped everyone overcome difficulties. Zheng Zhufang, a student, had two children and often couldn't study well, so she often helped Zheng Zhufang take care of the children; Li Qianfang had many children and couldn't go to school, so she adopted the method of delivering characters to her door to help her. As a result, both of them became literate in a very short period of time. Because of her serious teaching, the commune members changed their views on her.

In her teaching, in addition to teaching homophones, Hu Shixiu also adopted a teaching method of extending from one character (such as "田" (field) with the top and bottom protruding is "申" (apply), "申" (apply) with a horizontal line added above and below is "车" (vehicle), and "车" (vehicle) with a hat is "军" (army)). Sometimes she also combined it with actual explanations. When teaching the characters nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, she guided the students to analyze what kind of fertilizer was applied during the day and why these fertilizers were applied, which strengthened the students' memory.

In order to eliminate illiteracy in the whole township in a short period of time, for a period of time, she participated in production during the day, provided tutoring during rest, taught at night, and studied late at night to prepare lessons. She enabled sixteen graduating students to achieve four competences—to be able to read, write, speak, and use.

Writing 400 Poems

Luo Huaiying is a rural woman from Gulin County, Sichuan. In the past, she didn't know a single character. During the Great Leap Forward in Culture, after a short period of diligent study and hard practice, she got rid of illiteracy. She could read the Sichuan Peasant News, take notes, write letters, and write poems. She has written more than 400 poems from becoming literate to now.

In the past, she suffered a lot because she was illiterate. Once, she went to the city to buy cloth and mistook the oil coupon for a cloth coupon, resulting in a wasted trip. In 1956, she requested to join the League, but she couldn't write an application. She asked five people but none of them could write it, and finally the League branch secretary helped her write it. In the technical reform, the commune bought new-style walking plows and threshing machines. Although there were instructions, she couldn't understand them, and using them still didn't plow deep and the threshing efficiency was also very low. When she deeply realized the difficulties of not having culture, she urgently demanded to learn culture. This year, when their county launched a blitz to eliminate illiteracy, she was the first to actively buy books and enroll in school.

In her studies, she didn't let go of a single second, from dawn to dusk, from home to the construction site, regardless of time or place. She studied whenever she had time and asked people whenever she saw them. Every night, she insisted on studying for two hours. During the day, books and pens were never separated from her. When cooking, she put the books and pens on the stove, reading and writing while adding fuel to cook. When going to work, she also wrote the unfamiliar characters on a small blackboard and carried it to work, asking people who could read on the road. After a short period of diligent study and hard practice, she was no longer troubled by writing notes, recording work points, and writing letters to relatives and friends. At the same time, she also wrote more than 400 poems. In one of the poems praising the people's commune, she wrote:

	The people's commune is full of joy,
	The women sisters leave the kitchen,
	Babies and pigs are taken care of,
	Women can work in peace,
	The weather is good and the year is good,
	Happiness and joy are sung endlessly.

    妇女攻开文化关
    ·本报记者·
    一路学习到北京
    著名的青年农民科学家王保京的母亲—杜元贤，这次也到北京来出席全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议。
    五十二岁的杜元贤在不到两年的时间内，学会了一千五百字。并且组织了十三个老婆婆在一起学习，帮助大家摘掉了文盲帽子。因为她学习好，所以当选为出席这次妇女积极分子会议的代表。从陕西到北京，一路上，这位老大娘仍然坚持学习，她的口袋里装满了铅笔和小本子，一有空就掏出来学习。不论见到谁，她都要向人家宣传一番学文化的好处。凑巧，同她一起来北京开会的有植棉能手张秋香和另外两位老大娘，她们都是刚开始学文化的。杜元贤就自告奋勇担任教员组织她们一起学文化。她们没有带识字课本，杜元贤就编了一首顺口溜：“文化好比万宝山，各样科学在上边，要想上山去取宝，首先要过扫盲关。”她把这首顺口溜写在纸上给她们每人发一张。她们一路上学着念，学着写，列车还不到北京，都学会了这首顺口溜。
    到北京后，她们几个人凑巧又住在一个房间里，杜元贤又编了首歌颂人民公社好的歌子教她们学，很快又学会了。
    文盲成了呱呱叫的民校教师
    “说灯塔，讲灯塔，五队教师顶呱呱，原来是个睁眼瞎，二周识字一千八，全队选她当教师，日日夜夜教文化，社干社员拥护她，文武双全干劲大，人人都来把她夸。”
    湖北省当阳县扫盲参观团在参观长阳县灯塔人民公社后，写了这首诗赞扬灯塔社共青团员胡士秀。原来胡士秀经过十五天的苦战，就识字一千八，当上了民校教师。
    胡士秀初当民师的时候，有些群众带着轻视的口吻说：“才出土的黄毛尖子，怎么能教学，活害人。”但是她在党团组织的教育和支持下，坚持教学。为了保证学员都能上学，她帮助大家克服困难。学员郑竹芳有两个小孩，常常不能好好学习，她就经常帮郑竹芳照管小孩；李千芳孩子多不能上学，她采用送字上门的方法帮助她。结果，她们两人都在很短时期内脱盲了。由于她认真教学，社员们都改变了对她的看法。
    胡士秀在教学中，除了同音字教学外，还采用了从一字引伸的教学方法（如“田”字上下出头是“申”，“申”字上下加一横是“车”，“车”字戴上帽子是“军”），有时还结合实际讲解，在教氮、磷、钾等字时，她引导学员分析白天施的是属什么肥？为什么要施这些肥？加强了学员的记忆。
    为了使全乡在短期内扫除文盲，有一个时期，她白天参加生产，休息时进行辅导，晚上教学，深夜自学备课。使十六个毕业学生人人达到四会——会读会写会讲会用。
    写出诗歌四百首
    罗怀英是四川古蔺县的农村妇女，过去连一个字也不认识，在文化大跃进中，她经过短期的勤学苦练，摆脱了文盲状态，能读四川农民报，记笔记，写信和作诗，单是诗歌从脱盲到现在就编写了四百多首。
    过去她由于不识字，吃了许多苦头，有一次她进城去买布，把油票看成布票，结果白跑了一趟。1956年她要求入团，不会写申请书，找了五个人都没有写成，最后团支部书记才帮助她写。在技术改革中，社里买来了新式步犁和打谷机，虽然有说明书，但她看不懂，使用起来仍耕不深，打谷效率也很低。当她深深体会到没有文化的困难时，就迫切要求学文化。今年在她们县里开展突击扫盲时，她第一个积极买书报名入学。
    在学习中，她从天明到天黑，从家庭到工地，不分时间，不分地点，一分一秒都不肯放松，有空就学，见人就问。每天晚上还要坚持两个钟头的学习。白天书本和笔从未离过身，煮饭时把书和笔放在灶台上，边加火煮饭边读书写字，出工时也把不认识的字写在小黑板上提着去上工，路上碰着识字的人就问。经过短期的勤学苦练，她开便条、记工分，给亲友们写信，都不为难了，同时还写出了四百多首诗，其中有一首歌颂人民公社的诗中，她这样写着：
        人民公社喜洋洋，  妇女姊妹出灶房，
        娃娃猪儿有人管，  妇女安心搞生产，
        风调雨顺好时年，  幸福欢乐唱不完。（附图片）
