Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Reporter Wang Dianxue reports: Our country's leap forward plan for machine tool production this year has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. According to statistics from the First Ministry of Machine Building up to December 14th, the country has produced 94,224 various machine tools, more than double the total machine tool output of last year.

	One year's achievement has surpassed the past five years, which is the mark of the great leap forward of China's machine tool industry in 1958. The various machine tools manufactured this year are more than the total number of machine tools produced in the whole country during the first five-year plan. The batch of machine tools produced this year has greatly enriched China's machinery industry and provided more favorable conditions for next year's great leap forward.

	While completing the leap forward plan for output, the manufacturing level of China's machine tool industry has taken another big step forward. Many heavy-duty and high-precision machine tools that China could not manufacture in the past have been successfully trial-produced this year. According to statistics from nineteen large and medium-sized state-owned machine tool manufacturing plants alone, 145 new products were successfully trial-produced in the first eleven months of this year, including cutting-edge products such as electronic tube vertical lathes and program-controlled milling machines, as well as giant machine tools such as five-meter spiral milling machines and fourteen-meter gantry planers.

	The great development of machine tool production this year is the result of the machinery industry's resolute implementation of the Party's "walking on two legs" policy and the result of vigorously carrying out mass movements. This year's leap forward plan for machine tool production was achieved through the following three ways:

	In the "foreign" professional machine tool factories, a vigorous mass movement centered on increasing machine tool production was universally launched, so that the potential of equipment was further brought into play. According to statistics, the modern machine tools provided by the employees of professional state-owned machine tool factories this year are enough to equip more than one hundred modern large-scale machinery factories.

	Breaking the superstition of manufacturing machine tools and vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" is an important way to achieve a bumper harvest of machine tools. This year, many special zones and counties, and even people's communes, with great creativity, organized the "capable people" and "craftsmen" in their areas, used indigenous methods and simple tools to manufacture a large number of machine tools and equipped themselves. After more than three months of hard work, Tianjin Special Zone of Hebei Province manufactured more than 4,100 various machine tools such as gantry planers, lathes and milling machines. The farm tool factory of Nandao People's Commune in Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, manufactured 104 various indigenous machine tools in just half a month. At present, many counties have established mechanical manufacturing networks, and the machine tools urgently needed by these counties can now be manufactured by themselves.

	Many machinery manufacturing factories and repair factories of various departments self-reliantly manufacture machine tools, which is another way to increase machine tool production this year. Under the heroic slogan of not wanting or wanting less machine tools from the state, the employees of these factories brought into play their great initiative, not only manufactured a large number of machine tools to arm themselves, but also vigorously supported others. For example, the employees of the Luoyang Tractor Factory, which is under construction, have self-reliantly manufactured more than 430 various machine tools by using all the conditions that can be used. Another example is the Shanghai Hengxin Machine Factory, which was originally poorly equipped, has now become a factory capable of producing heavy-duty machine tools due to vigorously building simple machine tools to arm itself. It has now manufactured 51 heavy-duty machine tools.

	All these ways show that the policy of "walking on two legs" of "foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" is a completely correct and very important policy, and the road of vigorously carrying out mass movements is a road to victory. China's machine tool industry will continue to better implement this policy, adhere to this victorious highway, and push China's machine tool industry to a higher level. (Attached photo)

### 机床大丰收  超过九万台  大洋作骨干 小土并肩行  群众大动员  一年胜五年

    机床大丰收  超过九万台
    大洋作骨干 小土并肩行  群众大动员  一年胜五年
    新华社19日讯  记者王殿学报道：我国今年的机床生产跃进计划已经提前超额完成了。据第一机械工业部截至12月14日的统计，全国已经生产各种机床九万四千二百二十四台，比去年机床总产量增加二倍多。
    一年的成就超过了过去五年，这就是我国机床工业1958年大跃进的标志。今年我国已经制造出的各种机床，比第一个五年计划全国所产的机床总数还多。今年所产的这批机床，大大充实了我国的机械工业，为明年的大跃进提供了更有利的条件。
    在完成产量跃进计划的同时，我国机床工业的制造水平，又向前跨越了一大步。许多过去我国不能制造的重型和高精度的机床，今年已经试制出来。仅据十九个大中型国营机床制造厂的统计，今年头十一个月就试制成功一百四十五种新产品，其中有电子管立式车床、程序控制铣床等尖端产品，也有五公尺螺旋铣床、十四公尺长龙门刨床等巨型机床。
    今年机床生产的大发展，是机械工业部门坚决贯彻党提出的两条腿走路方针的结果，是大搞群众运动的结果。今年机床生产的跃进计划，是通过以下三条途径实现的。
    在“大洋”专业机床厂当中，普遍掀起了以增产机床为中心的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，因而使设备潜力得到进一步发挥。据统计，今年专业的国营机床厂的职工为国家提供的现代化机床，足够装备一百多个现代化的大型机械厂。
    破除制造机床的迷信，大搞“小土群”，这是机床丰产的一条重要途径。今年，许多专区和县，甚至人民公社，以极大的创造性，组织本区的“能人”、“匠手”，利用土办法和简单工具，造出了大批机床，装备了自己。河北省天津专区经过三个多月的苦战，就制造出来龙门刨床、车床和铣床等各种机床四千一百多台。江苏省溧阳县南渡人民公社农具厂，在短短的半个月之内就造出各种土机床一百零四台。目前不少的县已经建立起机械制造网，这些县当前迫切需要的机床已经能自行制造了。
    许多机械制造工厂和各部门的修理工厂自力更生地制造机床，这是今年机床增产的又一条途径。这些厂的职工在不要或少要国家供给机床的豪迈口号下，发挥了极大的能动性，不仅造出大批机床武装了自己，同时也有力地支援了别人。例如兴建中的洛阳拖拉机厂职工，利用一切可以利用的条件，已经自力更生地制造出各种机床四百三十多台。又如原来设备简陋的上海恒新机器厂，由于大造简易机床武装自己，现在已经成为一个能生产重型机床的工厂，目前已经制成重型机床五十一台。
    所有这些途径表明：“大洋群”和“小土群”两条腿走路的方针，是一个完全正确和十分重要的方针，大搞群众运动的道路，是一条胜利的道路。我国机床工业将继续更好地贯彻这个方针，坚持走这条胜利的康庄大道，把我国机床工业推向更高的水平。（附图片）
