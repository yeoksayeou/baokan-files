    Discussion on the Division of Labor Between Physical and Mental Labor
    A Division of Labor Primarily Based on Mental Labor or Primarily Based on Physical Labor Is Still Necessary in Communist Society
    Xu Junzheng
    I believe that, as Comrade Wei Gao said, "purely mental laborers" will no longer exist in the future, because people who engage purely in mental labor will first of all acquire knowledge that is divorced from reality and does not help promote the development of production. At the same time, people cultivated in this way will inevitably dislike labor and become detached from the working masses in terms of ideology and emotion.
    Of course, I also disagree with Comrade Wei Gao's statement: "Those engaged in mental labor do not need to participate in physical labor... Similarly, laborers directly engaged in the production of material goods do not need to master too much theory." This is not only because physical laborers will have spare time to engage in study and research in communist society, but also because production efficiency can be multiplied, ten-fold, or even dozens of times only when the vast majority of physical laborers master knowledge and theory, and new creations and inventions can continue to emerge.
    However, I agree with Comrade Wei Gao's statement that "the cause of inequality between mental and physical labor is class, not itself." I believe that a division of labor primarily based on mental labor or primarily based on physical labor is still necessary in communist society.
    Some people say that in communist society, "everyone is a theorist, inventor, writer, singer, and also an ordinary laborer." At that time, there is no need for "a few people to specialize in theory and scientific research." I think this statement is incorrect. Of course, in communist society, everyone can make inventions, study theories, and engage in writing, singing, and other activities in their spare time if they are interested, and even achieve something. However, society will still need a group of people who mainly engage in mental labor. The reason is very simple. First of all, I believe that the social division of labor and organizational structure of various scientific researches will still need to exist in the future, and a group of people will need to engage in specialized research (the difference is that their research goals, directions, and methods need to be further reformed), otherwise, various sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology, microbiology, medicine, astronomy, pedagogy, psychology, etc., will not be able to continue to improve. It is hard to imagine that in the future, everyone will need to study specialized knowledge such as microbiology, astronomy, and psychology. This is not only unnecessary, but also impossible; because even if a person's life is extended several times, it is impossible to master all scientific knowledge, and at the same time, society does not need to produce so many scientific instruments for everyone to study in depth. In addition, society also needs a group of workers who still mainly engage in mental labor, such as enterprise leaders and managers, teachers, journalists, etc. It is also difficult for us to imagine that in communist society, schools, teachers, etc. will no longer be needed. Of course, future teachers will need to have a lot of practical production knowledge, but they will still mainly engage in mental labor, that is, imparting knowledge and educating future generations. Therefore, I believe that it is unrealistic and detrimental to social development to completely eliminate the division of labor between mental and physical labor.
    Then, who will engage in professions that are primarily based on mental labor? The answer is that as long as they are willing, have the conditions, and are needed by society, anyone can. Society will make reasonable arrangements.
    Is this equal? Is it reasonable? I also believe that the cause of inequality and unreasonableness between mental labor and physical labor is class, the exploitation system, and the private ownership system. In order to maintain its class rule and class interests, the exploiting class uses a policy of obscurantism to shackle the working people. As for communist society, there is no private ownership system or exploiting class at all. All means of production are owned by the whole people, and everyone appears as a staff member of society, so everyone's status is equal. This division of labor is entirely for the needs of society, it is mutual cooperation, and it is mutual assistance.
    Will this lead to a few people monopolizing knowledge? Since the distribution principle of communism is to each according to his ability and to each according to his needs, and the individual's standard of living increases with the improvement of the living standards of the whole society, and knowledge cannot be bought and sold as a patent, knowledge monopoly will never reappear. At the same time, scientific research results and theoretical achievements will be quickly learned by the whole people, become the property of the whole people, and be used and enjoyed by the whole people, thereby further promoting the development of productive forces. It can be seen that division of labor research and universal improvement are consistent, and only division of labor research can lead to rapid universal improvement.

    关于体力劳动和脑力劳动分工问题的讨论
    以脑力劳动为主或以体力劳动为主的分工在共产主义社会仍然是必要的
    徐君正
    我认为如魏高同学所说的“单纯的脑力劳动者”将来不会再有了，因为单纯从事脑力劳动的人，首先他所获得的知识是脱离实际的，无助于推动生产向前发展，同时这样培养出来的人，在思想意识上和感情上必然会厌恶劳动，脱离劳动群众。
    当然，我也不同意魏高同学如此的说法：“从事脑力劳动的人不必参加体力劳动……。同样直接从事于物质资料生产的劳动者，也没有必要掌握太多的理论。”这不仅因为到共产主义社会体力劳动者有余暇的时间可来从事学习与研究，而且也只有当广大的体力劳动者掌握了知识和理论，才能使生产效率成倍、十几倍、几十倍的提高，才能不断出现新的创造和发明。
    但我同意魏高同学所说的：“造成脑力劳动和体力劳动的不平等的原因是阶级，而不是其本身”。我认为以脑力劳动为主或以体力劳动为主的分工，在共产主义社会仍然是必要的。
    有人说到共产主义社会“人人都是理论家、发明家、作家、歌唱家，也都是普通劳动者。”那时候不需要“少数人专门搞理论、科学研究”了。我想这种说法是不对的。当然到共产主义社会人人都可以有所发明，可以研究理论，有兴趣也可以利用业余时间从事写作、歌唱等活动，而且有所成就。但社会仍然需要有一部分主要从事脑力劳动的人。这原因很简单。首先，我认为将来各种科学研究的社会分工和组织机构仍然是需要存在的，而且需要一部分人从事专门研究（所不同的是他们研究的目的、方向和方法要进一步得到改造），不然，各门科学如物理学、化学、生物学、微生物学、医学、天文学、教育学、心理学等等，就无法继续提高。很难设想，将来需要每个人都来研究像微生物学、天文学、心理学之类专门知识，这不仅不必要，而且也不可能；因为即使将一个人的生命延长几倍也无法掌握全部科学知识，同时社会也不必要生产如此多的科学仪器供每个人深入研究。除此以外，社会上还需要一部分仍然以从事脑力劳动为主的工作者，如企业的领导和管理人员、教员、记者等等。我们也很难设想，到共产主义社会像学校、教员之类都不需要了，当然，将来的教员要具备很多实际生产知识，但他们总还是以脑力劳动即传授知识、教育后代为主。所以我认为要根本消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工，是不现实的，对社会发展是不利的。
    那末哪些人来从事以脑力劳动为主的职业呢？答复是只要愿意，同时条件具备、社会需要，谁都可以。社会是会合理安排的。
    这样是否平等？是否合理？我也认为造成脑力劳动和体力劳动的不平等、不合理的原因是阶级、是剥削制度、是私有制度。剥削阶级为了维护其阶级统治和阶级利益，所以用愚民政策来束缚劳动人民。至于到了共产主义社会，根本没有了私有制和剥削阶级，一切生产资料已归全民所有，大家都以社会的工作人员面目出现，因此大家的地位都是平等的。这种分工完全是为了社会需要，是互相协作，是互相帮助。
    是否会因此造成少数人垄断知识呢？既然共产主义的分配原则是各尽所能，各取所需，个人的生活水平是随着全社会生活水平的提高而提高，知识又不能当作专利品来买卖，所以知识垄断也就绝对不会再现了，同时科学上的研究成果和理论成就也将迅速为全民所学习，成为全民的财产，为全民所利用和享受，从而进一步推动生产力的发展。由此可见，分工研究与普遍提高又是一致的，也只有分工研究才能有迅速的普遍提高。
