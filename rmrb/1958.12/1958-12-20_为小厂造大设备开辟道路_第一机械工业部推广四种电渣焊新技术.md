To pave the way for small factories to build large equipment, the First Ministry of Machine Building is promoting four new electroslag welding technologies.

(Our Dispatch) The First Ministry of Machine Building recently held a seven-day National Electroslag Welding On-Site Conference in Harbin to promote new electroslag welding technologies, opening up broad avenues for medium-sized and small machinery factories to manufacture heavy equipment on a large scale.

The conference introduced four mastered electroslag welding techniques: wire electroslag welding, plate electrode electroslag welding, consumable nozzle electroslag welding, and manual electroslag welding. These four types of electroslag welding machines are manufactured using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, with an emphasis on indigenous techniques. They are simple in structure and easy to understand. A small factory with only two or three machine tools can build an electroslag welding machine in three or four days. The function of the electroslag welding machine is that it can weld very thick steel castings and forgings into long, round, curved, and various other large parts, which is the best way to solve the problem of medium-sized and small factories lacking large casting and forging equipment. When Harbin Jiancheng Machinery Factory manufactured a 12,500 kW turbine, the factory's casting capacity could only cast 800 kilograms at a time. A five-ton seat ring required the cooperation of a heavy machinery factory for supply. After adopting electroslag welding technology, the five-ton seat ring was divided into eight parts for casting, and then welded together using electroslag welding, which was solved in its own factory.

Electroslag welding can not only solve the problem of insufficient casting and forging equipment capacity for large blanks, but also solve some special shape problems that cannot be solved by casting and forging methods. Using electroslag welding to weld and repair defects in large castings, forgings and processing allows defective products to be revived.

The representatives attending the conference came from more than 260 state-owned factories, universities, and scientific research departments in 29 provinces and cities across the country. After visiting the electroslag welding exhibition, on-site demonstrations, technical lectures, and seminars, they unanimously felt that in the situation where the country needs the machinery manufacturing industry to vigorously supply heavy machinery, the widespread promotion of this new technology enables small and medium-sized factories to undertake the task of manufacturing heavy equipment, and large factories can manufacture larger heavy machinery. Guangzhou Heavy Machinery Factory participated in the conference with drawings for a 3,000-ton hydraulic press and a 600 mm thin plate rolling mill to be produced next year, solving the difficulty of not being able to make large blanks. Representatives from Wuhan Shipyard, Tianjin Turbine Factory, and Sifangtai Qiaoji Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory planned to adopt electroslag welding for large and heavy blanks such as the 850 mm rolling mill, 72,500 kW turbine, and locomotives to be manufactured by various factories next year.

China's electroslag welding technology has been rapidly developed since May of this year on the basis of learning from Soviet experience and according to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with an emphasis on indigenous methods. Under the close cooperation of scientific research institutions, universities, and factories, the electroslag welding test was closely integrated with production, and major components such as the 800 mm rolling mill stand, the 72,500 kW turbine main shaft, and the 15,000 kW turbine seat ring were successfully welded. These significant achievements made with indigenous electroslag welding machines eliminated the original mysterious notion that foreign electroslag welding was unattainable, creating conditions for the widespread promotion and application of new electroslag welding technology.

    为小厂造大设备开辟道路
    第一机械工业部推广四种电渣焊新技术
    本报讯  第一机械工业部最近在哈尔滨举行为期七天的全国电渣焊现场会议，推广电渣焊新技术，为中、小型机械工厂大造重型设备开拓广阔的道路。
    这次会议介绍了已经掌握的四种电渣焊技术，即：焊丝电渣焊，板极电渣焊，熔咀电渣焊，手工电渣焊。这四种电渣焊机，是以土、洋结合，以土为主的办法制造的。结构简单，一看就会。只要有两、三台机床的小工厂，花三、四天时间就可以做成电渣焊机，电渣焊机的作用是：它可以把一节节一块块很粗的钢铁铸、锻件，焊成长的、圆的、弯曲的各种各样的巨大部件，是解决中、小工厂无大型铸、锻设备困难的最好方法。哈尔滨建成机械厂制造一万两千五百瓩水轮机时，因为工厂的铸造能力一次只能铸八百公斤。一个五吨重的座环，需要重型机械工厂协作供应。采用电渣焊技术后，把五吨重的座环分成八块铸造，再用电渣焊拼焊起来，在自己工厂就解决了。
    电渣焊不仅能解决铸锻设备能力不足的大型毛坯问题，而且还能解决一些形状特殊、用铸、锻办法不能解决的难题。用电渣焊焊补大的铸、锻件和加工活的缺陷，使废品复活。
    参加这次会议的代表，来自全国二十九个省市的国营工厂、大专学校、科学研究部门等二百六十多人。他们经过参观电渣焊展览会、现场表演、技术讲座和座谈等活动，一致感到在国家需要机械制造工业大力供应重型机器的情况下，广泛推广这项新技术就使中小工厂能够担负起制造重型设备的任务，大型工厂能够制造更大的重型机器了。广州重型机械厂带着明年要生产的三千吨水压机和六百公厘的薄板轧钢机的图纸参加了会议，解决了原来无法做大型毛坯的困难。武汉造船厂、天津水轮机厂、四方台樵机车车辆厂参加会议的代表对各厂明年制造的八百五十公厘轧钢机、七万二千五百瓩水轮机、机车等大型、重型毛坯都作出采用电渣焊的规划。
    我国电渣焊技术是在学习苏联经验的基础上，根据土、洋结合，以土为主的方针在今年5月以来，迅速发展起来的。在科学研究机构、高等学校、工厂三者密切协作的情况下。使电渣焊的试验与生产密切结合、先后焊接成功八百公厘轧钢机机架、七万二千五百瓩水轮机主轴、一万五千瓩水轮机座环等重大部件。用土电渣焊机取得的这些重大成果，清除了原来认为洋电渣焊高不可攀的神秘观念，给普遍推广、运用电渣焊新技术创造了条件。
