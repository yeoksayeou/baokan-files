    Plastic Machine Parts: Labor and Material Savings
    The workers of Jianhua Machinery Factory recently used plastic to replace steel to make machine handle knobs, sample ring outer covers, and oil press protective caps. Originally, the manufacture of oil press protective caps required seven processes in three workshops: casting, machining, and chrome plating. A production worker could only process a maximum of twenty per day. Now, using plastic not only saves steel but also eliminates seven processes, increasing production efficiency by 25 times and reducing costs by 12 times.

    The jointly owned public-private Tianxiang Instrument Factory began research in September on using plastic to replace copper and aluminum raw materials. Now, the factory has officially used plastic to manufacture various instrument knobs, telescope sunshades, instrument oil bottles, eyepiece reticle covers, and other instrument parts, totaling fourteen types. The quality is fully qualified, durable, and the appearance is smooth and beautiful. During processing, it eliminates several processes such as fitting, turning, and electroplating, resulting in high production efficiency and low costs. The factory has decided to vigorously promote this advanced experience and use plastic to replace non-ferrous metals as the direction for future production development. Recently, they designed and successfully manufactured a "plastic molding" machine, which has been put into mass production. They plan to use a fiber plastic that is more solid than copper and aluminum, yet costs less, to manufacture most of the parts when producing the Model 52 level, gradually moving towards plasticization.

    塑料做机件  省工又省料
    建华机械厂职工，最近试用塑料代替钢料做成了机器把上的手球，检验产品的样圈外套和榨油机保护帽等。原来做榨油机保护帽需要经过翻砂、机械、镀烙三个车间七道工序才能加工出来，一个生产工人一天最多加工二十个；现在用塑料制做，不但节约了钢材，同时节省了七道工序，提高生产效率二十五倍，降低成本十二倍。

    公私合营天祥仪器厂从9月份即开始了用塑料代替铜、铝原料的研究工作。现在，该厂已正式用塑料制造仪器的各种扭手、望远镜遮光筒，仪器油瓶、目镜分度罩等十四种仪器零件。质量完全合格，坚固耐用，外表光洁美观，加工时省去钳工、车工电镀等数道工序，生产效率高，因而成本也低。这个厂决定大力推广这一先进经验，并且利用塑料代替有色金属作为今后发展生产的方向。最近他们自己设计并制造成功了“胶母”机，已大量投入生产。准备将来生产52型水平仪时，绝大部分零件要用一种比铜、铝还坚实、成本又低的纤维塑料来制造，逐步走向塑料化的道路。
