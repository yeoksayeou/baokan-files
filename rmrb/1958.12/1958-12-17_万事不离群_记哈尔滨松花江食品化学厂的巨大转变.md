Everything Stems from the Masses
    ——A Record of the Tremendous Transformation of the Harbin Songhua River Food Chemical Factory
    Written Collectively by Our Newspaper Reporters

    A Saddle Shape

    The Harbin Songhua River Food Chemical Factory (formerly a pickle factory) was a Japanese and puppet military food factory taken over in 1947. After the takeover, it was led by the Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army. The factory's leading cadres were transferred from the army and rural areas. Although they lacked enterprise management knowledge, they were familiar with the working methods of the mass line. At that time, the factory had over a thousand workers and only a dozen management cadres, without massive management organizations such as workshops and sections. However, the production tasks were completed very well.

    From 1954 onwards, the factory studied so-called "standardized" scientific management. Some leading cadres with rural work experience also belittled themselves, thinking that their methods were no longer effective. As a result, they blindly added institutions. The factory had over two hundred workers, with more than sixty management cadres. This approach to managing the enterprise, which only saw the importance of management organizations and rules and regulations without relying on the Party and the masses, turned the vigorous atmosphere within the factory cold and desolate.

    The great rectification movement of 1957 began. The Party led the masses in airing views freely, writing big-character posters, and conducting great debates. With overwhelming momentum, they burned away the "three winds" and "five airs" of the leading cadres, thoroughly changing the unreasonable management system. From then on, the Party's leading role in the enterprise was firmly established, promoting the implementation of the mass line, and giving full play to the subjective initiative of the people.

    The Party's leadership of the enterprise began first with political and ideological leadership. Wang Baoyu, the Party branch secretary of the Food Chemical Factory, came from the army. He brought the fine traditions of political work from the army to the enterprise. According to the Party's political movements in each period, they closely combined with the common ideological problems among the workers, mobilizing the masses to educate themselves. For example, in the rectification movement, they adopted the methods of the masses acting as teachers, the masses giving lectures, and launching mass debates to resolve the relationship between individual interests and national interests, and to debate for whom they were working and what constituted individual "future."

    Li Chuanfang, a young worker, was one of the most vocal in the factory about the "future" issue. The factory asked him to be a "teacher" and talk about his ideological activities of being uneasy about working in the pickle factory. He said, "Working in a pickle factory, producing a pound of pickles is worth only a few jiao, but producing a machine part is worth dozens or hundreds of yuan. Making pickles doesn't contribute much to the country, and it doesn't benefit individuals much either." He also said that learning to drive a car takes at least six months, but making pickles can be done with your hands, so this simple labor is not as interesting as complex labor; making pickles is looked down upon in society." After he finished speaking, many young workers supported him, and a heated debate began. Jiang Xueyuan, a worker in the fermented bean curd group, said, "The old society believed that getting promoted and becoming rich was the future, but we are workers in the new society, and we don't want that kind of future! There are different divisions of labor in the new society, and doing any job is for the purpose of building socialism!" Wang Fuyuan, a worker in the packaging group, also pointed out sharply, "Those who make machines and drive cars have to eat pickles and soy sauce, and they have to rely on us!" After this debate, the masses came to their own conclusions. They said, "The country has a future, the factory has a future, and individuals also have a future."

    They also held various exhibitions, visited rural areas, watched operas and movies, invited people to give reports, and wrote and performed short plays... Each activity was organized with mass discussions, allowing socialist ideology to occupy the ideological battlefield everywhere. After the rectification movement, a surge of learning swept the factory, and the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works became very common. The factory had four hundred and thirty employees, subscribed to two hundred and seventy-three copies of Party newspapers and one hundred and fifty-one copies of "Red Flag" magazine. The vast majority of employees have developed a good habit of learning about current affairs, caring about the Party's policies, and reading newspapers every day. Blackboards and wall newspapers were set up in the dormitories, and books, comic books, newspapers, and magazines were added. Workers read books and newspapers and listened to the radio when they returned to the dormitories after work, truly planting the red flag in every corner.

    Experience Brought from the Army

    In the Food Chemical Factory, the principle of high democracy and high centralization from the army has been fully applied to the enterprise. Wang Baoyu, the Party branch secretary, said, "In the past, when our troops fought the enemy, we held 'Zhuge Liang meetings' before each battle whenever conditions permitted, mobilizing soldiers to come up with ideas and think of solutions. As a result, we were invincible. If we dared to promote democracy in war, we should do so even more in enterprises." Therefore, here, all major issues related to the factory's production and enterprise management are mobilized to the masses, and the wisdom of the masses is concentrated through airing views freely, writing big-character posters, and conducting great debates to solve them.

    Last May, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued instructions on reforming institutions and delegating cadres, the employees of the Food Chemical Factory encountered two different opinions among the cadres when considering abolishing the workshop management organization. One opinion was that abolishing the workshop was reasonable because the factory was small, and leading cadres could go all the way to the end and directly grasp the groups, which was conducive to production. The other opinion was that after abolishing the workshop, four work sections still needed to be established to lead the groups through the work sections. Doing so would not only fail to streamline the organization, but would instead increase the organization and manpower. Those who held the latter opinion mainly had four fears: first, fear of creating chaos; second, fear of heavy leadership tasks; third, fear of losing the handle after abolishing the workshop; fourth, fear that the group leaders would not be able to lead. In essence, they lacked a mass perspective and did not realize that rules and regulations are made by people and need people to implement them. In order to solve this problem, the Party organization mobilized the masses to conduct debates. The masses unanimously opposed the addition of work sections and demanded that the factory director go deep into reality and directly lead the groups. After the debate, the understanding was unified, and the sections and workshops were immediately abolished. The factory director directly led twelve production groups. In addition to leaving thirteen cadres, all other cadres were delegated to participate in production, reducing twenty-five books of accounts to six, creating universal cards, replacing nineteen kinds of forms and reports, and greatly improving the efficiency of management work.

    After the streamlining of the organization and the delegation of personnel, a contradiction arose between the small number of cadres and the heavy burden of production management work. At this time, old worker Jiang Xueyuan proposed a suggestion of "implementing a group-based contract system from the entry of raw materials to the exit of products." However, some leading cadres expressed doubts, fearing that the workers would not manage well, and believing that so many cadres had not managed well in the past, so could they manage well now? The Party organization mobilized the masses to discuss this suggestion, and everyone unanimously supported it. After it was implemented throughout the factory, it proved to be very effective. For example, for many years, old wine and mother oil had been used to make fermented bean curd. After the implementation of the group-based contract system, the operating procedures were boldly reformed, using white wine instead of old wine and mass oil instead of mother oil, resulting in a saving of more than one thousand six hundred yuan for the country throughout the year and improving the quality. The fact that the masses broke through the old rules and regulations educated the leaders, and those who could not be persuaded in the past were now persuaded. The masses also reflected: "We dare to do it now, and there is no more restraint."

    In order to effectively overcome the "three winds" and "five airs" of the cadres and enable the leading cadres to be directly supervised by the masses, the Party organization of the factory, based on the spirit of "officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, and officers and soldiers teach each other" in the army, stipulated that all cadres in the factory should participate in the comparison in their respective production groups once a month together with the workers. The content of the comparison mainly included leadership style, leadership methods, participation in labor, and the relationship between cadres and the masses. Through the comparison, the cadres consciously overcame their shortcomings and corrected their mistakes in a timely manner under the supervision of the masses, which strongly spurred the cadres to continuously move forward. For example, in the comparison in June of this year, four cadres were criticized by the masses for not having good leadership styles and not participating in labor enough. They corrected their shortcomings in a timely manner, and in the comparison in July, three cadres received unanimous praise from the masses. As a result, the leading cadres truly appeared among the masses as ordinary laborers, the workers trusted the leaders more, and the leaders relied more on the masses.

    No One is Left Behind

    When the Food Chemical Factory was working on the work of people, it closely grasped two important links: first, grasping the advanced and grasping the backbone, and establishing banners among the masses; second, believing that backward masses can be transformed and transformed, and actively helping them to transform and transform.

    They absorbed the political work experience from the army and the experience of striking root, connecting with and relying on activists during the land reform in the old liberated areas. They selected a group of down-to-earth, selfless activists from the employees, cultivated them, and established banners. These advanced backbone elements had a good influence among the masses. Learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced became the direction of efforts for all employees.

    When conducting ideological education for backward elements, the Party committee adhered to the principle of combining leadership and the masses, mobilizing the entire Party to help backward elements. They also used the political work experience of "ideological mutual assistance" and "ideological contracting" from the army, assigning a special person to provide ideological mutual assistance to each backward element and conduct regular inspections. Zhao Shitong was the most backward worker in the factory. The Party committee determined that in addition to the Party group leader providing ideological assistance to him, Wang Baoyu, the Party branch secretary, also provided assistance to him. They both made friends with him, talked about ideology, made family visits, and provided assistance at any time from work to life, from inside the factory to outside the factory. Zhao Shitong, who used to quarrel and fight with the hospital for opening sick leave slips, now refuses to rest even when the doctor opens a sick leave slip when he is sick. In the second quarter of this year, Zhao Shitong was unexpectedly selected as an advanced worker in the factory.

    Before the rectification movement, there were a total of twenty-four backward workers in this factory, and now all of them have been transformed. Many people have become the backbone and advanced producers of the factory.

    Caring for Workers Twenty-Four Hours a Day

    "In the past, in the army, cadres cared very much about soldiers, pouring foot-washing water and covering soldiers with quilts at night. The same should be done for employees in enterprises." The leading cadres of the Food Chemical Factory inherited and carried forward this fine tradition from the army, caring for and protecting the masses everywhere. They not only cared about the daily production, work, and study of employees, but also cared about all aspects of the workers' lives.

    During the Spring Festival and other holidays, the factory organized a delegation mainly composed of leading cadres to visit sick and recuperating employees. This spring, when the factory was vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, technician Sun Peilu suffered from arthritis, making it difficult for him to walk. The Party branch sent cadres to visit him with letters of sympathy written by the workers. Technician Sun was moved to tears, and as soon as he recovered from his illness, he immediately went to work and successfully trial-produced soy sauce paste, soy sauce powder, and monosodium glutamate. A spirit of mutual care and care was also generally formed among the employees.

    The factory's leading cadres used the power of the masses and the spirit of thrift to solve the employees' living problems such as clothing, food, and housing. Ma Dengyu's family of seven relied on his fifty yuan salary to make a living, but he never liked to talk about his difficulties in life. Last autumn, there was continuous rain, and his house was washed down by rainwater, and he had no money to repair it. When the factory leaders and the trade union learned about this, they immediately allocated some waste wood and organized many employees to repair Ma Dengyu's house on Sundays.

    The saying "Even an honest official cannot settle family disputes" no longer applies in this factory. Some people are good workers in the factory, but when they return home, they implement "dictatorship," and everything has to be decided by them; some people advocate democracy, unity, and mutual respect in the factory, but when they return home, they beat their wives and scold their children. There are also people in the families who abuse the children of their husbands' ex-wives. In response to these situations, the Party organization launched a family rectification movement. Husbands made suggestions to their wives, wives made suggestions to their husbands, and mother-in-laws and daughters-in-law, and neighbors also launched airing views freely, writing big-character posters, and conducting great debates. Bai Yuzhen, Li Futings wife, was a famous lazy woman before the rectification movement. When Li Futing went to work, she made good food for herself at home; when Li Futing got off work, he still had to cook for himself. They quarreled and scolded all day long, which greatly affected Li Futing's production morale. During the family rectification movement, neighbors posted big-character posters to Bai Yuzhen, criticizing her lazy thoughts of not working; the trade union also held a "bedside reconciliation meeting" to persuade them to reconcile. After making suggestions to each other, Bai Yuzhen apologized to Li Futing and promised to respect each other and live a good life in the future. Now, they live happily. When they get off work, they go to the nursery together to hug their children and go home happily. Examples like Li Futing are not isolated cases. This has played a certain role in promoting the great leap forward in production.

    Helping Others Without Reservation

    As a result of carrying out mass movements and conducting in-depth and meticulous ideological education work in the enterprise, many communist sprouts emerged in the factory like bamboo shoots after a rain. The Party organization seized these sprouts, actively supported them, and made them rapidly flourish.

    They not only did a good job in their own production, but also treated their relations with fraternal enterprises with communist thought everywhere. They set up two pickle factories for street residents and suburban agricultural cooperatives, helped them solve funding and equipment problems, and taught them the technology without reservation; they themselves started from scratch and tried to produce new products, such as monosodium glutamate and bacterial fertilizers. The production of bacterial fertilizers requires a set of equipment and technology, but they do not ask the state for money to purchase equipment, but rely on the masses to find solutions. As a result, they started production in a narrow factory building, using existing wooden barrels and large vats.

    After the successful trial production of bacterial fertilizers, many fraternal factories sent people to learn from their experience. One of them was a certain chemical factory that had once blocked their access to bacterial fertilizer production technology and also came to learn from them. Some people in the factory said: "We ran into snags when we went to their factory to learn, and now we should also ridicule them." At this time, someone immediately opposed this view. As a result, they enthusiastically and responsibly introduced all the bacterial fertilizer technology to them as they did to other factories. The employees of this factory not only enthusiastically helped those who came to the factory to learn, but also actively imparted their experience when they went to other places to learn, if others needed it. In the process of learning, they also promptly raised the problems they found to the other party and helped to solve them. When technician Wang Wenguo was learning the experience of manufacturing liquid bacterial agents at the Qingdao Brewery, he discovered that the factory had three shortcomings in the process of breeding strains, and promptly raised them to the factory. These problems were precisely the difficult problems that the factory had been unable to solve for a long time, and this time they were all solved.

    Selfless Labor Becomes the Trend

    In the past, after the employees finished their eight hours of work, they hurried home to arrange their housework and felt that it was a great burden to attend meetings, study, and engage in voluntary labor in their spare time. The current situation is the opposite. Employees work hard regardless of on or off work, day and night, as long as production requires it, and no one is willing to lag behind. They said: "Our work is like a battle, and the Party organization is like a command headquarters."

    In addition to strengthening political and ideological education work, an important issue for the Food Chemical Factory to cultivate this spirit of selfless labor among employees is to effectively solve the specific difficulties of employees. Although employees with very difficult lives can get subsidies from the factory, it is not a long-term solution to live on subsidies alone. Under this circumstance, the factory Party organization adopted measures to fundamentally solve the problem - organizing employees' families to participate in labor.

    Since August of this year, the factory has organized employees with difficult families to work overtime in their spare time. The processing fee for tying a bacterial fertilizer wooden box is one jiao and four fen. The factory held a meeting to call on difficult households to sign up. At this time, only thirty-six of the factory's four hundred employees participated. Although there are many people with difficulties, they think that if everyone rushes to tie boxes, they will not be able to solve the problems of truly difficult households. Therefore, many people would rather suffer a little bit themselves than fight for this income. Recently, the Party organization decided to change the overtime labor of tying boxes to voluntary labor, and all the income from tying boxes belongs to the factory. Anyone with difficulties will be subsidized from the collective income. After this decision was announced, all the employees of the factory came to participate in the labor that day. Ma Yuanbao, an old worker from the horse-drawn cart team, also wanted to tie boxes. He asked Vice Factory Director Yuan Guixiang: Where do you tie boxes? Yuan Guixiang told him that the money for tying boxes is no longer distributed to individuals. He said: "Yes! I know that it belongs to the collective that I went to tie!"

    In order to better build socialism, this factory has now formulated a new learning system. From six thirty in the morning to twelve thirty in the afternoon every day is production time, and from one to five in the afternoon is learning time. The whole factory has become a school. With the implementation of this learning system, the workers' working hours have been reduced by two hours compared to the past, but the production quantity has not been reduced. Worker Yang Hanqi said: "The factory has developed from a pickle factory to a food chemical factory. How can we adapt to the needs without culture? We must ensure that we neither delay production nor delay learning."

    万事不离群
    ——记哈尔滨松花江食品化学厂的巨大转变
    本报记者集体采写
    马鞍形
    哈尔滨松花江食品化学厂（原酱菜厂）是1947年接管的一个日伪军需食品工厂。接管后由第四野战军后勤处领导，工厂的领导干部都是从部队、农村调来的，虽然他们没有企业管理知识，但他们却熟悉群众路线的工作方法。那时候，这个厂有上千名工人，只有十多名管理干部，没有车间和股室等庞大的管理机构，但生产任务却完成得很好。
    从1954年起，这个厂学习所谓“正规化”的科学管理，一些有农村工作经验的领导干部，也妄自菲薄，认为自己这一套吃不开了。于是盲目增添机构，全厂二百多名工人，就有六十多名管理干部。这种只看到管理机构和规章制度的重要，而不依靠党、依靠群众的管理企业的做法，就使得厂内朝气蓬勃的局面变得冷冷清清。
    1957年伟大的整风运动开始了。党领导群众大鸣、大放、大辩论，以排山倒海的声势，火烧领导干部的“三风”“五气”，彻底改变了不合理的管理制度，从此党在企业里的领导作用牢固地树立起来了，推动了群众路线的贯彻执行，人的能动作用得到了充分的发挥。
    党对企业的领导，首先从政治思想领导开始。食品化学厂的党总支书记王保玉是部队干部出身，他把部队上那套政治工作的优良传统带到了企业里来。他们根据党在每个时期的政治运动，密切结合职工中有普遍性的思想问题，发动群众自己教育自己。例如，在整风中，他们就采用群众当教员，群众讲课，开展群众大辩论的方法，来解决个人利益和国家利益的关系，辩论为谁劳动、什么是个人“前途”等问题。
    青年工人李传芳是这个厂里闹“前途”问题最厉害的一个。厂里就请他作“教员”，让他讲讲不安心酱菜厂工作的思想活动。他说，“在酱菜厂工作，生产一斤酱菜值不了几角钱，可是生产一只机器零件却值几十元、几百元，做酱菜对国家没有多大贡献，对个人也没啥好处。他还说，学开汽车最少要学六个月，做酱菜有手就会做，这种简单劳动不如复杂劳动有意思；做酱菜社会上瞧不起。”他讲完以后，不少青年工人支持他，一场热烈的辩论开始了。豆腐乳组工人姜学元说：“旧社会认为升官发财是前途，我们是新社会的工人，可不要那样的前途！新社会各有分工，做什么工作，都是为了建设社会主义！”包装组工人王福元也尖锐地指出：“造机器的也好，开汽车的也好，要吃咸菜，吃酱油，总得依靠我们！”经过这场辩论，群众自己做出了结论。他们说：“国家有前途，工厂有前途，个人也有前途。”
    他们还举办各种展览会，到农村访问，看戏，看电影，请人作报告，自编自演活报剧……，每次活动都组织群众座谈讨论，处处让社会主义思想占领阵地。整风后，全厂掀起了学习高潮，学习马列主义、毛主席著作的非常普遍。这个厂有四百三十名职工，订阅了二百七十三份党报，一百五十一份“红旗”杂志，绝大部分职工已经养成学时事、关心党的方针政策、天天读报的良好习惯。宿舍里建立了黑板报、壁报，添置了图书、小人书、报刊杂志，工人下班回到宿舍看书看报、听广播，真正是把红旗插到了每个角落。
    从部队带来的经验
    在食品化学厂，部队上的高度民主高度集中的原则被充分地运用到企业里面来了。党总支书记王保玉说：“过去，我们部队和敌人打仗，只要条件允许，每次战役前都召开‘诸葛亮会’，发动士兵出计谋、想办法，结果我们是战无不胜，攻无不克。对战争我们尚且敢于发扬民主，在企业里更应该如此。”所以，在这里凡是有关全厂生产和企业管理的重大问题，都发动群众，通过大鸣大放大字报大辩论，集中群众智慧来解决。
    去年5月，中共中央发布了关于改革机构、下放干部的指示后，食品化学厂的职工群众在酝酿取消车间管理机构时，在干部中遇到了两种不同的意见。一种意见认为取消车间是合理的，因为厂子小，领导干部可以一竿子到底，直接抓小组，对生产有利。另一种意见认为取消车间后，还需要设立四个工段，通过工段来领导小组。这样做，不但不能精简机构，相反增加了机构和人力。持后一种意见的人，他们主要有四怕：一怕搞乱；二怕领导任务重；三怕取消车间后抓不着头；四怕小组长领导不起来。实质上是缺乏群众观点，没有认识到规章制度是人制定的，要人去执行的。党组织为了解决这个问题，发动群众进行了辩论。群众一致反对增设工段，要求厂长深入实际，直接领导小组。经过辩论，认识统一了，于是随即取消了股室和车间，厂长直接领导十二个生产小组。全厂除留下十三名干部外，其他干部都下放参加了生产，将二十五本账减少到六本，创造了万能卡片，代替了十九种表报，管理工作效率大大提高了。
    在机构精简人员下放后，产生了干部人数少同生产管理工作繁重之间的矛盾。这时老工人姜学元提出了一件“从原料进厂到产品出厂，实行小组分工包干制”的建议。但有些领导干部却表示怀疑，怕工人管不好，认为过去那么多干部没有管好，现在就能管好吗？党组织发动群众讨论了这项建议，大家一致拥护。在全厂推行后，证明效果是很好的。如多年来作腐乳都用老酒和母油，实行小组包干制后，大胆改革了操作规程，用白酒代替了老酒，用大众油代替了母油，结果全年为国家节约一千六百多元，并提高了质量。群众这些突破旧规章制度的事实，教育了领导，过去闹不通的人，也通了。群众也反映：“我们敢干了，没有拘束了。”
    为了有效地克服干部的“三风”、“五气”，使领导干部直接受群众监督，这个厂的党组织根据部队上“官教兵，兵教官，官兵互教”的精神，规定了全厂干部每月一次在自己分片包干的生产小组内，同工人一起参加评比。评比的内容主要是领导作风、领导方法、参加劳动以及干群关系等。通过评比，干部自觉地在群众的监督下，及时地克服缺点和改正错误，这就有力地鞭策了干部不断地前进。如今年6月份评比中，有四名干部因为领导作风和参加劳动不够好，受到了群众的批评。他们及时改正了缺点，在7月份的评比中，有三名干部受到了群众的一致赞扬。这样做的结果，领导干部真正以普通劳动者的姿态在群众中出现，工人更加信任领导，领导也更加依靠群众了。
    落后的人没有了
    食品化学厂在作人的工作的时候，紧紧地抓住两个重要环节：一，抓先进、抓骨干，在群众中树立旗帜；二，相信落后群众可以改造和转变，并积极帮助他们改造和转变。
    他们吸取部队上的政治工作经验，和在老解放区土改时扎根串连依靠积极分子的经验，在职工中选拔了一批踏实肯干、舍己为公的积极分子，对这些人进行培养，树立了旗帜。这些先进的骨干分子，在群众中产生了良好的影响。学先进、赶先进成了全体职工的努力方向。
    在对落后分子进行思想教育的时候，党委坚持了领导和群众相结合的原则，全党动手，帮助落后分子。并且还运用了部队上的“思想互助”和“思想包干”的政治工作经验，对每个落后分子指定专人进行思想互助，定期检查。赵世同是全厂最落后的工人，党委确定除由党的小组长对他进行思想帮助外，党总支书记王保玉也对他进行帮助。他们都和他交朋友，谈思想，作家庭访问，从工作到生活，从厂内到厂外，随时进行帮助。过去经常到医院为开病假条子而吵嘴打架的赵世同，现在有了病医生开了请假条子却不肯休息。今年第二季度，赵世同破天荒地被选为全厂的先进工作者。
    这个厂在整风前共有二十四个落后工人，现在全部转变过来了，不少人已成为全厂的骨干和先进生产者。
    关心工人的二十四小时
    “过去在部队里，干部十分关心战士，晚上给士兵倒洗脚水，盖被子，在企业里同样应该这样关心职工。”食品化学厂的领导干部正是继承和发扬了部队上这种优良的传统，处处关心和爱护群众。他们不仅关心职工每天的生产、工作和学习，而且还关心到工人的全部生活。
    每逢过年过节，厂里都以领导干部为主组成慰问团，探望生病和休养的职工。今年春天，全厂大闹技术革命的时候，技师孙培禄患了关节炎，行走很困难。党总支就派干部带上工人写的慰问信前去探病。孙技师感动得流下了眼泪，病刚刚痊愈，就马上上班，试制成功了酱油膏、酱油粉和味之素。在职工群众中也普遍形成了相互关心和照顾的风气。
    厂的领导干部用群众的力量，本着节约的精神去解决职工的衣、食、住等生活问题。工人马登玉家有七口人，只靠他一个人的五十元工资过活，但他从不爱讲自己生活上的困难。去年秋季阴雨连绵，他家的房子被雨水冲塌了，没有钱修理。这件事被厂的领导和工会知道了，立即拨一部分废木料，组织许多职工利用星期天去给马登玉修理了房子。
    “清官难断家务事”这句话在这个厂已经不生效了。有的人本来在工厂里是个好工人，但回到家里却实行“专政”，什么都要自己说了算；有的人本来在工厂讲民主，讲团结和互相尊重，但回到家里却打老婆骂孩子。在家属里也有虐待丈夫前妻所生子女的人。党组织根据这些情况，开展了家庭整风。丈夫给妻子提意见，妻子给丈夫提意见，婆媳、邻居之间也展开了大鸣大放大辩论。李福庭的妻子白玉珍，在整风前是个出名的好吃懒做的女人，李福庭上班了，她自己在家做好的吃；李福庭下班了还要自己做饭。成天吵嘴骂架，对李福庭的生产情绪很受影响。家属整风时邻居给白玉珍贴出了大字报，批评她不劳动的懒惰思想；工会也召开了炕头和好会，劝他俩和好。经过互相提意见，白玉珍向李福庭作了检讨，并保证以后互相尊重，过好日子。现在，他俩生活得很美满，下班的时候，两个人一起到托儿所抱着孩子笑嘻嘻的回家去。像李福庭这样的例子不是个别的。这对促进生产大跃进起到了一定的作用。
    无保留地帮助别人
    企业中大搞群众运动和进行深入细致的思想教育工作的结果，全厂犹如雨后春笋似的出现了许多共产主义萌芽。党组织抓住了这些萌芽，积极地扶植它，并使它迅速地发扬光大。
    他们不仅把自己的生产搞好，而且处处以共产主义思想来处理同兄弟企业的关系。他们为街道居民和郊区农业社办起了两个酱菜厂，帮助他们解决资金和设备问题，还无保留地把技术教给他们；自己则另打锣另开张，去试制生产新产品，如味之素和细菌肥料等。生产细菌肥料需要一套设备，要有技术，但是他们一不向国家要钱购置设备，二是依靠群众想办法。结果就在狭小的厂房里，运用原有的木桶、大缸开始了生产。
    细菌肥料试制成功以后，许多兄弟工厂派人来学习经验，其中有一个曾经对他们封锁过菌肥生产技术的某化学工厂，也来向他们学习了。厂内有的人说：“咱们到他们厂学习，碰了钉子，现在，我们也该挖苦一下。”这时，立即有人反对这种意见，结果，他们像对待其他厂一样，热情负责地把全部菌肥技术介绍给他们。这个厂的职工不仅热情帮助来厂学习的人，当他们到外地学习时，如果别人需要，也都是主动的传授经验。在学习中，他们还把发现的问题及时向对方提出来，并帮助解决。技师王文国在青岛酿造厂学习制造液体菌剂的经验时，发现这个厂在菌种培育过程中有三个缺点，便及时向工厂提出。这几个问题恰是这个厂好久无法解决的难题，这次全都解决了。
    忘我劳动成风气
    过去，职工做完八小时的工作，就急急忙忙地回家去安排自己的家务事，对业余时间开会、学习、搞义务劳动感到是个很大的负担。现在的情况与此相反，职工们不分上、下班，白天和黑夜，只要生产需要就全力以赴，谁都不甘落后。他们说：“我们的工作真像战斗一样，党组织就像个司令部。”
    食品化学厂培植职工这种忘我劳动的精神，除了加强政治思想教育工作外，切实解决职工的具体困难是个重要问题。虽然生活很困难的职工可以得到工厂的补助，但单靠补助过日子总不是久远之计。在这种情况下，工厂党组织采取了从根本上解决问题的措施——组织职工家属参加劳动。
    从今年8月起，工厂在业余时间组织家庭困难的职工加班劳动，捆一个菌肥木箱加工费是一角四分钱。工厂开会号召困难户报名。这时，全厂四百多名工人中只有三十六人参加。虽然有困难的人很多，但他们想，如果都去争着捆箱子就不能解决真正困难户的问题。所以很多人宁肯自己苦一些也不去争这份收入。最近党组织又决定捆箱子的加班劳动改为义务劳动，捆箱子的收入全部归工厂所有，谁有困难就从集体收入中补助。这个决定公布后，当天全厂职工都来参加劳动。马车组老工人马元宝也要去捆箱子，他问副厂长袁桂香：捆箱子在什么地方。袁桂香告诉他现在捆箱子的钱不分给个人了。他说：“是呀！我知道是归集体才去捆的呀！”
    为了更好地建设社会主义，现在这个厂制定了一个新的学习制度。每天早上六点半到中午十二点半是生产时间，下午一点到五点是学习时间，全厂变成了一所学校。实行这个学习制度，工人的劳动时间比往常减少了两个小时，但是，生产数量却没有降低，工人杨汉歧说：“工厂由酱菜厂发展成食品化学厂了，没有文化怎能适应需要呢？我们一定要做到既不耽误生产，也不耽误学习。”
