    Common Struggle, Genuine Friendship

    The heroic Algerian people recently sent their envoys of friendship on a long journey to visit our country and were warmly welcomed by our government and people. The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, composed of Social Affairs Minister Youssef Ben Khedda, Minister of Armaments and Supplies Mahmoud Chérif, and Director of the Information Department Chahd Dariebe, stayed in our country for nearly half a month, visiting the south and north, cities and villages, and held talks with our government leaders. The Chinese people are very pleased to see that the visit of the Algerian Republic delegation has enhanced mutual understanding between our two peoples and strengthened mutual support between the two countries. It will write a memorable page in the history of friendly relations between the two peoples.

    The joint communique issued by the governments of China and Algeria reached unanimous views on the current international situation, especially the situation of the Algerian struggle and the relevant issues of developing relations between the two countries. Both sides firmly support the universal demand of the people of all countries in the world to stop testing and prohibit the use of nuclear weapons, firmly support the struggle of the Asian and African people against colonialism, and believe that all foreign troops should withdraw from Asian and African countries. These common positions of the Chinese and Algerian governments will undoubtedly have a positive impact on maintaining world peace and strengthening the solidarity of the Asian and African people.

    Although China and Algeria are separated by thousands of miles, the people of the two countries are closely linked in the common struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of peace. The Chinese people have also suffered long-term oppression by imperialism in the past, and therefore, they have deep sympathy for the countries and peoples who are currently fighting for and defending national independence. Our people have always cared about and admired the Algerian people who are fighting heroically for independence and freedom, and have always regarded their struggle as their own and their victory as their own. In the joint communique, the Chinese government reiterated its solemn position stated at the Bandung Conference, firmly supporting the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence. The colonialist ambition of French imperialism to turn Algeria into a French province will never be realized. Algeria is Algeria for Algerians! This is the proposition of the Algerian people, the proposition of the Asian and African people, and the proposition of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world. As the joint communique points out, the heroic Algerian people, who are adhering to the anti-colonialist struggle, will surely achieve the final victory of national liberation with the support of the Arab countries and people, as well as peace-loving countries and people all over the world.

    Today, in Algeria, the dawn of final victory is rising. In recent years, the National Liberation Army has grown stronger and stronger, developing from a 3,000-man guerrilla force into a fighting force of 150,000 men with considerable modern equipment, controlling two-thirds of the territory of Algeria. The Algerian people have demonstrated a spirit of arduous heroism in the fighting, giving the French colonialists a heavy blow. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in September this year marks a new stage in the struggle of the Algerian people. Although the Algerian people will still encounter difficulties on the road ahead, and although French imperialism, with the assistance of US imperialism, will intensify its suppression of the Algerian people's national revolutionary movement, all of this cannot subdue the Algerian people, but will only make the Algerian people stronger and more tempered in the flames of struggle. Whether it is the colonialist forces of France or the colonialist forces of the United States, they are rotting away day by day and are heading towards their demise. In Algeria, as in other parts of the world, the real force is not the vicious imperialism, but all the people who are striving for peace, striving for independence, and striving for their own better future. Minister Youssef Ben Khedda said well in his speech at the welcoming rally of the people of all walks of life in the capital: "The Algerian people will surely win, because their cause is just, because they stand on the side of progress, and colonialism is weakening and is doomed to die."

    The heroic struggle of the Algerian people is an integral part of the surging national revolutionary movement in the entire Asian and African region. The struggle of the Algerian people is not only for their own independence and freedom, but also encourages the fighting spirit of all colonial and dependent countries against colonial enslavement. Their struggle not only powerfully strikes at the colonial forces of French imperialism, but also provides support for the people of all countries who are opposing imperialism, especially the aggression of US imperialism. It is precisely because of this that their struggle will surely receive increasingly broad sympathy and support from the Asian and African people and the people of the world.

    During its visit to China, the delegation of the Provisional Government of Algeria studied specific ways to strengthen relations between the two countries and affirmed the principles of establishing diplomatic relations and cultural relations between the two countries. It is believable that in the years to come, the friendly cooperative relationship between the people of China and Algeria will definitely continue to develop. Now, as the delegation of the Provisional Government of Algeria is about to embark on its journey home, let us once again express our gratitude to the friends of the delegation, and hope that they will bring the sincere friendship and high respect of the 650 million Chinese people to the fighting Algerian people, to the Algerian people who are moving towards greater victory.

### 共同的斗争  真挚的友谊

    共同的斗争  真挚的友谊
    英雄的阿尔及利亚人民，最近派遣了他们的友谊使节，远程来访我国，受到我国政府和人民的热烈欢迎。由社会事务部长优素福·本·赫达、军备和供应部长马哈茂德·谢里夫和宣传部办公室主任沙阿德·达列伯组成的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，在我国逗留了近半个月的时间，访问了我国的南方和北方，城市和乡村，并且同我国政府领导人举行了会谈。中国人民非常高兴地看到，阿尔及利亚共和国代表团的访问，增进了我们两国人民的互相了解，加强了两国人民的互相支持，它将在两国人民的友好关系史上写下值得纪念的一页。
    中国和阿尔及利亚两国政府发表的联合公报，对当前国际局势、特别是阿尔及利亚的斗争形势和发展中阿两国关系的有关问题，取得了一致的看法。双方坚决支持世界各国人民对停止试验和禁止使用核武器的普遍要求，坚决支持亚非人民反对殖民主义的斗争，并且认为一切外国军队应该撤出亚非国家。中国和阿尔及利亚两国政府的这些共同的主张，无疑地将对维护世界和平和加强亚非人民的团结产生积极的影响。
    中国和阿尔及利亚虽然相隔千山万水，但是两国人民在反对帝国主义侵略和维护和平的共同斗争中却是息息相关的。中国人民过去也曾经遭受过帝国主义的长期压迫，因此，对目前正在争取和维护民族独立斗争的国家和人民抱着深切的同情。我国人民始终关怀和钦佩为独立自由而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，始终把他们的斗争也看作是自己的斗争，把他们的胜利也看作是自己的胜利。在联合公报中，中国政府重申它在万隆会议上所表明的严正立场，坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。法国帝国主义企图把阿尔及利亚变成法国一省的殖民主义野心是永远不能实现的。阿尔及利亚是阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚！这是阿尔及利亚人民的主张，这是亚非人民的主张，这也是世界上一切爱好和平与自由人民的主张。正同联合公报所指出，坚持反殖民主义斗争的英勇的阿尔及利亚人民，在阿拉伯国家和人民以及全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，一定能够取得民族解放的最后胜利。
    今天，在阿尔及利亚，最后胜利的曙光正在升起。几年来，民族解放军愈战愈强，已从一支三千人的游击队发展成为拥有相当现代化装备的十五万人的战斗部队，控制了阿尔及利亚全境的三分之二的土地。阿尔及利亚人民在战斗中表现了艰苦卓绝的英雄气概，给法国殖民者以沉重的打击。今年9月阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立了，这更标志着阿尔及利亚人民的斗争进入一个新阶段。尽管阿尔及利亚人民在前进的道路上还会有困难，尽管法帝国主义在美帝国主义的援助下，还会加紧镇压阿尔及利亚人民的民族革命运动，但是这一切都不可能使阿尔及利亚人民屈服，只会使阿尔及利亚人民在斗争的烈火中百炼成钢，更加坚强。不论是法国的殖民主义势力，还是美国的殖民主义势力，都正在一天天烂下去，正在走向末日。在阿尔及利亚，正同在全世界其他地方一样，真正有力量的决不是穷凶极恶的帝国主义，而是一切正在争取和平、争取独立、争取自己美好未来的人民。优素福·本·赫达部长在首都各界人民欢迎大会上的讲话中说得好：“阿尔及利亚人民必将取得胜利，因为他们的事业是正义的，因为他们站在进步力量的一边，而殖民主义却正在削弱并且注定要死亡。”
    阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，是整个亚非地区风起云涌的民族革命运动的组成部分。阿尔及利亚人民的斗争不仅是为了争取自己的独立自由，也鼓舞了一切殖民地附属国人民反抗殖民奴役的斗志。他们的斗争不仅有力地打击了法帝国主义的殖民势力，也是对于正在反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义侵略的各国人民的一种支援。正是因为这样，他们的斗争一定会得到亚非人民和全世界人民日益广泛的同情和支持。
    阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团在访问中国期间，同中国政府研究了加强两国关系的具体办法，肯定了两国建立外交关系和文化关系的原则。可以相信，在未来的岁月中，中国和阿尔及利亚人民的友好合作关系，一定会得到不断的发展。现在，当阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团即将启程回国的时候，让我们再一次向代表团的朋友们表示感谢，并且希望他们把六亿五千万中国人民真挚的友谊和崇高的敬意，带给战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民，带给正在走向更大胜利的阿尔及利亚人民。
