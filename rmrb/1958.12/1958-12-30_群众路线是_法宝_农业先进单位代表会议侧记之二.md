    The great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 achieved great successes and accumulated rich experiences. Of the myriad experiences, the peasant masses believe that the most important are the Party's leadership and the working method of the mass line. The peasants said: "Of the thousands of principles, the Party's leadership is the first; of the thousands of strategies, the mass line is the first." This is the deep feeling of China's 500 million peasants and the valuable experience of the vast number of rural workers. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his address on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, quoted this sentence from the peasants, once again emphasizing the importance of the Party's leadership and the mass line, urging everyone to accept this valuable experience as a driving force for the continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

    The six thousand male and female representatives attending the meeting, while studying Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report, reflected on and understood the spirit of the Party Central Committee and summarized their own work. The Party's leadership and the working method of the mass line are inseparable. Without the Party's leadership, there is naturally no way to talk about how to follow the mass line. Regarding how to implement the working method of the Party's mass line, the representatives each had their own experiences and understandings. Listening to these discussions is like a hundred flowers blooming, each with its own fragrance. Some are good at leading production through production, and educating the masses through experimentation; some are good at conducting ideological work among the masses; some start from caring about the lives of the masses, and inspire the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses. The methods are different, but the mass viewpoint is consistent: always regard the masses as masters, care for the masses, believe in the masses, and rely on the masses.

    When the people's communes began to implement the "three transformations," Gou Peifang, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Hongqi People's Commune in Changzhi City, paid special attention to promoting democracy and conducting ideological education among the masses. Gou Peifang was originally a demobilized soldier. It was precisely the ten years of military life in the People's Liberation Army that made him understand that in carrying out all work, one must first pay attention to the ideological education of the masses. He said that any work must be done by people, and people have thoughts. For every matter, everyone has their own ideas. If the thinking is not right, then they cannot work happily. The great leap forward in agricultural production over the past year has made him deeply feel that only when the peasants gradually overcome the small-peasant economy mentality and have socialist and communist ideological awareness can they think far, have great ambition, and have sufficient energy. For example, when the commune wanted to run industry, some peasants initially had many concerns, feeling that there was a lack of equipment and technology, and that agricultural production was too busy, lacking confidence in self-reliance in running industry; however, they also felt the need for industry. With a farm tool repair shop, new tools could be manufactured, and more work could be done; with a fertilizer factory, production could be greatly increased. Wanting to do it and not daring to do it, this is a contradiction. Gou Peifang, focusing on this problem, spoke extensively about the benefits of industry supporting agriculture and the integration of industry and agriculture, explaining that there was nothing mysterious about running industry, and that small factories could be run entirely by themselves. When the peasants had a clear understanding ideologically, they set up farm tool factories and fertilizer factories. Everyone used new tools, and one person could do the work of several people. Seeing that chemical fertilizers could greatly increase production, they realized the benefits of running industry. The masses' interest in running industry became higher and higher, and their enthusiasm became greater and greater, and the commune-run industry flourished.

    Cadres planting experimental plots is a good experience in combining general calls with specific guidance in leading agricultural production. Guan Musheng, Vice Chairman of the Changfeng People's Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, used and loved this leadership method as early as the mutual aid group period. In the past, when engaging in close planting, deep plowing, and the use of improved varieties, the general public did not believe it at first, so he first showed it to the masses. When the masses saw its benefits and truly believed it in their hearts, those who originally did not agree would become active. When the people's commune set up canteens, he also first helped to run one village well, and then organized visits and introduced experiences, aroused everyone's interest, and the masses were willing to do it.

    Gao Mingzhong, Director of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Yuxiang, Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, is very good at caring for the masses, understanding the masses, and being good at bringing out the enthusiasm of the masses. The commune's affairs are very busy, but he still maintains the old habit of participating in production. Whenever he has time, he loves to run to the fields, chatting with the commune members while working, everyone talking and laughing, talking about everything. From these casual conversations, he can grasp the thoughts of the masses and hear various reflections. He said that every time he works with the masses for half a day, he feels particularly clear-headed. He said that some things the masses cannot understand for a while, because the masses hear too little about the principles. Therefore, when he comes into contact with the masses, he often explains the Party's policies and principles through various specific issues. When the people's commune was first established, he worked with the commune members in the fields, and everyone asked him various questions: What should we do about children going to school? Can pigs still be raised? Will the houses be collectivized? After listening to his propaganda and explanation, the masses dispelled various unnecessary concerns and truly understood the principle that running a commune is to accelerate socialist construction and make everyone live a happier life.

    Gao Mingzhong understands the psychology of the masses very well, and he always chooses the most popular way to work, gradually arousing the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, once when he was working in the field, he found that the labor efficiency was not high, and there was a lot of wasted time. He did not immediately come forward to correct or criticize, like some impatient people, but further deepened his understanding and looked for an appropriate time to mobilize the masses to solve this problem on their own. Later, at lunchtime, he found that the production team's food was not well organized, so he guided everyone to make comments on the food problem, and jointly discussed and determined ways to improve it with the cooks. After solving the masses' livelihood problems, and then discussing production problems, the masses became even more energetic. Everyone put forward ways to improve the labor organization, and competitions were launched between teams, and the labor efficiency was greatly improved.

    Gao Mingzhong often cares about the suffering of the masses and cares about the lives of the masses. When there are sick people in the village, he leads the village cadres to express their condolences; when the masses living in the mountains lack daily necessities, he often reminds the people at the foot of the mountain to adjust and supply them; every time he goes to a village, he first looks at the canteen to see if it is well run, and whether the nurseries and homes for the elderly are comfortable. He said that we should, through our own work, make the masses deeply realize that the more socialist construction develops, the happier everyone's life will be; the more we care about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be; the closer the cadres and the masses will be, and the more united they will be.

    群众路线是“法宝”——农业先进单位代表会议侧记之二
    本报记者  林沫
    1958年的农业生产大跃进获得伟大的成就，也取得了丰富的经验。经验何止万千，但农民群众认为最重要的还是党的领导和群众路线的工作方法。农民们说：“千条万条，党的领导是第一条；千计万计，群众路线是第一计。”这是中国五亿农民的深切体会，也是广大农村工作者的宝贵经验。中共中央副主席刘少奇同志在代表中共中央向全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的致词中，引用了来自农民的这句话，再次强调说明党的领导和群众路线的重要性，要大家接受这个可贵的经验，作为1959年农业生产继续向前跃进的动力。
    到会的六千个男女代表们，在学习刘少奇副主席的报告的时候，一面思索领会党中央的精神，一面总结自己的工作。党的领导和群众路线的工作方法两者是分不开的，没有党的领导，当然也就谈不上如何走群众路线了。对于如何执行党的群众路线的工作方法，代表们各有各的经验和体会。听听这些讨论，真好像百花争艳，各有异香。他们有的善于通过生产领导生产，通过试验教育群众；有的善于向群众进行思想工作；有的从关心群众生活入手，启发群众的积极性和主动性。方法各有不同，但群众观点却是一致的，时时刻刻把群众当作主人，关心群众，相信群众，依靠群众。
    在人民公社开始实行“三化”的时候，长治市红旗人民公社党委副书记苟佩芳同志就特别注意发扬民主，对群众进行思想教育。苟佩芳原是个转业军人，正是在人民解放军中十来年的部队生活使他懂得了：进行一切工作，必须首先注意群众的思想教育。他说，任何工作都要靠人来作，而人是有思想的，对每一件事，都各有各的想法，如果思想不对头，也就不能痛痛快快地干。一年来的农业生产大跃进使他深深感到只有农民逐步克服小农经济思想，具有社会主义和共产主义的思想觉悟，才能想的远，气魄大，干劲足。例如社里要办工业，最初有些农民却有很多顾虑，感到缺少设备，没有技术，农业生产又太忙，对自力更生办工业缺乏信心；但是，他们又感到需要工业，有了农具修配厂能制造新工具，能多出活路；有了化肥厂，可以多增产。想办和不敢办，这就是一个矛盾。苟佩芳就针对这个问题，大讲特讲工业支援农业和工农业并举的好处，说明办工业并没有什么神秘，小工厂自己完全可以办。农民思想上有了认识，把农具厂、化肥厂办起来了。大家使上了新的工具，一个人能干几个人的活，眼见化学肥料能够大大增产，体会到了办工业的好处，群众对办工业的兴趣越来越高，劲头越来越大，社办工业就蓬勃地开展起来了。
    干部种试验田，这是一般号召和具体指导相结合的领导农业生产的好经验，湖北省孝感县长风人民公社的副社长官木生同志，早在互助组的时候就使用和爱上了这种领导方法。过去搞密植、深耕和使用良种，起初一般群众不相信，他就先作出样子给群众看。使群众看到了它的好处，心里确实相信了，原来不赞成的人也会变得积极起来。人民公社办食堂，他也是先帮助搞好一个村的，然后组织参观，介绍经验，引起大家的兴趣，群众也就愿意作了。
    山西运城县于乡东风人民公社的社主任高鸣钟同志，很能关心群众、了解群众和善于发挥群众的积极性。公社的事务是很忙的，但他仍然保持着参加生产的老习惯。一有功夫，他就爱跑到地里，同社员一边干活，一边拉家常，大家又说又笑，无话不谈。他从这些闲谈中能够摸到群众的心思，听到各种反映。他说，每当他同群众一起劳动上一半天，头脑就感到格外清醒。他说，有些事情群众一时想不通，这是因为群众听的道理太少。所以，当他同群众接触的时候，就经常通过各种具体问题，解释党的方针政策。人民公社初建立的时候，他同社员在地里干活，大家就向他提出了各种各样的问题：小孩子上学怎么办呀？猪还能不能养呀？房子是不是要归公呀？群众听了他的宣传解释，才打消了各种不必要的顾虑，真正懂得了办公社是要加速社会主义建设，使大家生活得更幸福的道理。
    高鸣钟很懂得群众的心理，他总是选择最受群众欢迎的方式进行工作，逐步启发群众的积极性。例如有一次他在田间劳动时，发现劳动效率不高，窝工浪费很大。他并不像有些急性人那样，立即出面纠正或批评，而是进一步深入了解，并寻找适当时机发动群众自行解决这个问题。后来在午饭时他又发现这个生产队伙食办得不好，他就引导大家对伙食问题提意见，和炊事员共同商定了改善的办法。在解决了群众的生活问题之后，再进而讨论生产问题，群众的劲头也就更大了。大家提出了改善劳动组织的办法，班与班展开了竞赛，劳动效率就大大提高了。
    高鸣钟经常关心群众的疾苦，关心群众生活。村子里有了病人，他就领着村干部去慰问；住在山上的群众缺少生活用品，他经常提醒山下人调剂供应；每到一个村子，他先看食堂办的好坏，托儿所和敬老院是否舒适。他说，我们应该通过自己的工作，使群众深切地体会到，社会主义建设越发展，大家的生活越幸福；我们越关心群众的生活，群众的干劲就越大；干部和群众也就越来越亲密，越过越团结。
