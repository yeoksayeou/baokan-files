    Steel Warrior Qiu Cai Kang in Beijing
    By Our Correspondent Ge Lai

    The famous steel warrior Qiu Cai Kang came to the capital to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress and delivered a speech at the meeting, which moved many young activists. Last Saturday afternoon, I, as a reporter, made a special visit to a hospital where Qiu Cai Kang is receiving treatment and recuperating.

    Dr. Yang Tianhao, who is responsible for his medical care, told me that Qiu Cai Kang's blood pressure had risen somewhat since arriving in Beijing due to excitement. Although the doctors tried to calm Qiu Cai Kang, it was impossible to restrain his boiling heart.

    When I entered Qiu Cai Kang's ward, doctors and nurses from the physiotherapy department were carefully operating shortwave and ultrasound therapy machines to treat Qiu Cai Kang. After Qiu Cai Kang learned of my intentions, he said to me, "Our great Party has given me a second chance at life. The very fact that I can still live in this world shows the greatness of the Party's power. Ten and a half tons of molten steel at a temperature of more than 1,300 degrees Celsius burned 89.3% of my skin. I died three times, but the Party was determined to save me from death at all costs. I truly realized that with the Party, there is Qiu Cai Kang."

    Afterwards, Qiu Cai Kang spoke about his miserable life in the old society, where he worked as a ship's handyman and a street vendor in Shanghai, wandering everywhere. He also talked about how, after liberation, he received meticulous care and patient cultivation from the Party at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, which enabled him to understand how to be a Party member, a steel warrior, and how to dedicate everything he had to the Party without reservation, selflessly serving the socialist construction of the motherland. He became more and more excited as he spoke. He said, "Because I love the Party, the Party cares for me even more. For the sake of the Party, I fought resolutely with the god of death. Although the doctors found that my left hand was necrotic after the burns and had to amputate it, what does that matter? The most important thing is that the Party gave me life. As long as my heart can still beat, as long as my eyes can still see, I can wear a pair of glasses and still produce more and better steel for the Party."

    Qiu Cai Kang also showed me a letter that had just arrived from Moscow from Xie Jiernikov, a steel expert at the Sukharev Iron and Steel Plant. He said, "I have been corresponding with this steel expert frequently recently. I want to learn from the valuable experience of the Soviet elder brother, so that our steel production will increase sharply." Indeed, he has forged a deep emotional bond with the steel industry. Just the day before coming to Beijing, he returned to the factory where he had worked for eight years to see his steel comrades and his beloved high converter, touching it here and looking at it there, as if he had met relatives he had been separated from for a long time.

    In the hospital, Qiu Cai Kang also loves the collective and the people he lives with. When he heard that there was another steel warrior, Deng Mingqi, in the hospital who had also been burned by molten steel, he asked to live with him, constantly comforting his fellow patient and sharing his experiences of fighting the disease with others. He also cares about other patients in the hospital, and whenever he has time, he goes to other wards to tell them stories about steelmaking. The nurse who guards Qiu Cai Kang told me that Qiu Cai Kang loves to learn. As soon as he arrived at the hospital, he subscribed to the People's Daily and the China Youth Daily. In addition to his daily medical treatment time, he often sets aside a certain amount of time to study Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Hu Yaobang's recent report at the National Youth Activists Congress, and sometimes organizes patients in the same room to discuss. Qiu Cai Kang also told me that he plans to go to Shijingshan and Anshan to meet the worker brothers there after his burns heal, to learn their steelmaking technology and advanced experience. After returning to Shanghai, he wants to train more apprentices so that the output of the high converter will double again.

    On his table were many letters. Qiu Cai Kang said that he has received nearly three thousand letters from all over the country since he was burned, and he is very grateful for everyone's care and love.

    I talked with Qiu Cai Kang for a long time, but he showed no signs of fatigue, and his face was always full of vitality. At this time, the deputy secretary of the hospital's Party committee and the president appeared in Qiu Cai Kang's ward. In order to restore his joint mobility function as soon as possible and allow him to receive good recuperation, the medical staff here guard him day and night. After Qiu Cai Kang arrived in Beijing, the people of the capital also cared about him very much, and many people asked to see Qiu Cai Kang. The medical staff of the Department of Physical Therapy of Beijing Medical College promptly sent people to give Qiu Cai Kang physical therapy. The staff of the Beijing Library also collected various documents on the treatment of burn scars in their busy schedule. When the news that Qiu Cai Kang was coming to this hospital for treatment and recuperation spread throughout the hospital, everyone was excited and resolutely expressed their determination to complete this glorious task. Even the cooks immediately went to southern restaurants to learn how to cook southern dishes for him. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the whole hospital organized a special team for medical treatment and nursing. When the medical team decided to do a skin scar softening test on Qiu Cai Kang, the staff of various departments of the hospital signed up one after another, asking to experiment on themselves first, willing to contribute their share to the health of the steel warrior. Dr. Yang Tianhao said emotionally: "Qiu Cai Kang's tenacity in overcoming death and his noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the Party and steel have moved us. Qiu Cai Kang loves the Party, and we love Qiu Cai Kang even more." Yang Tianhao also firmly stated that Shanghai Guangci Hospital, under the leadership of the Party, saved his life. We are determined and confident to give him better recuperation, overcome all difficulties, reconnect his arms and fingers, and send him to the steel front as soon as possible to realize his great ideals.

    钢铁战士丘财康在北京
    本报记者  格来
    著名的钢铁战士丘财康来到首都，出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，并在会上讲了话，许多青年积极分子听了他的讲话，很受感动。上个星期六的下午，记者特地到丘财康正在那里治疗和休养的某医院，作了一次访问。
    负责医疗他的杨天豪医师告诉我，丘财康来北京后，由于兴奋，血压有些上升，虽然医生们尽量使丘财康平静，但那里能抑制他那一颗沸腾的心。
    当我走进丘财康的病房时，理疗科的大夫和护理人员们正在细心地操纵着超短波和超音波的医疗机，给丘财康进行医疗。丘财康知道我的来意后，向我说：“我们伟大的党给了我再生的机会，我还能活在世界上，这个事实本身就说明了党的力量是伟大的，一千三百多度高温的十吨半钢水烫伤了我89.3％的皮肤，我死过三次，但党决心不惜一切，从死里把我救出来，我真正地体会到有了党，才有我丘财康。”
    以后，丘财康讲起在旧社会里他在上海作轮船杂工，摆小摊，到处流浪的凄惨生活，又讲起解放后他到上海第三钢铁厂受到党的无微不至地关怀和耐心培养，使他懂得做一个党员，做一个钢铁战士，要怎样把自己的一切毫无保留地献给党，忘我地为祖国的社会主义建设服务。他愈谈愈兴奋。他说，正因为我爱党，党更关心我，为了党，我和死神作过坚决地搏斗。虽然我烫伤后，医生发现我的左手已经坏死，不得不截肢，但这又算得了什么呢？最重要的是党给了我生命，只要我的心还能跳动，只要我的眼睛还能看得见，我戴上一副眼镜，照样可以为党炼出更多更好的钢。
    丘财康还让我看了一封刚从莫斯科寄来的苏喀高新脱钢铁厂的钢铁能手谢杰尔尼科夫给他的来信。他说：“我最近和这位钢铁能手经常通信，我要好好学习苏联老大哥的宝贵经验，让我们的钢铁产量直线上升。”的确，他和钢铁事业结下了深厚的感情。就在来北京的前一天，他又回到工作了八年的工厂里看望他的钢铁战友和自己心爱的高转炉，到炉旁这儿摸摸，那儿看看，好像见了分别很久的亲人一样。
    在医院里，丘财康也热爱着集体，热爱和他一起相处的人们。他听说医院里还住着一位也是被钢水烧伤的钢铁战士邓明琦，就要求和他住在一起，不断安慰他的病友，把自己和疾病作斗争的经验介绍给别人。他还很关心住在医院里的其他病人，一有空就到别的病房里给人们讲炼钢的故事。守护丘财康的护理员告诉我，丘财康很爱学习，一来医院就订了人民日报和青年报。他除了每天的医疗时间外，经常抽出一定的学习时间，学习毛主席的著作和胡耀邦同志最近在全国青年积极分子大会上的报告，有时还组织同房的病友们进行讨论。丘财康还告诉我，他准备等到烫伤痊愈后，到石景山、鞍山去和那里的工人弟兄们见见面，学习他们的炼钢技术和先进经验；回上海以后要多带些徒弟，让高转炉的产量再翻几番。
    在他的桌上放着不少的信件，丘财康说，自从他烧伤后收到全国各地的来信将近有三千封，他非常感激大家对他的关心和爱护。
    我和丘财康谈了很久，但他毫无倦意，脸上始终流露着无限的生命力。这时医院党委副书记和院长又出现在丘财康的病房里。为了早日恢复他的关节活动功能和让他得到很好的疗养，这里的医务工作同志日日夜夜守护着他。丘财康到北京后，首都人民也很关心他，许多人要求去看丘财康。北京医学院体疗系的医务工作人员及时派人给丘财康进行体疗。北京图书馆的人员也在百忙中搜集关于治疗烧伤疤痕的多种文献。当丘财康要到这个医院来治疗和休养的消息在全院传出后，人人兴奋，都坚决表示要完成这个光荣任务，连炊事员也马上跑到南方饭馆学习做南方菜给他吃。全院在党委的领导下组织了医疗和护理的专门小组。当医疗小组决定给丘财康做皮肤疤痕软化试验时，医院各部门的工作人员都纷纷报名，要求先在自己身上作实验，愿为钢铁战士的健康献出自己的一分力量。杨天豪医师感动地说：丘财康顽强地战胜死亡，一心为党为钢的高贵品质打动了我们，丘财康热爱党，我们更爱丘财康。杨天豪还坚决地表示，上海广慈医院在党的领导下挽救了他的生命，我们有决心有信心使他得到更好的疗养，克服一切困难，给他接胳膊和手指，早日把他送上钢铁战线，去实现他的伟大理想。
