    Realize Mechanization of Foundry Work

    Whether the machinery industry can achieve a Great Leap Forward depends first and foremost on whether foundry production can keep up. All kinds of machinery and equipment first require a large number of castings. For general machines, the weight of castings accounts for 50%-80% of the machine's weight. With the promotion of replacing steel with iron and forging with casting, the demand for castings has only increased. This requires casting production to keep pace accordingly.

    At present, in China's machinery manufacturing industry, except for a few machine factories in large cities that have realized foundry mechanization, most small and medium-sized factories' foundry workshops still use manual operations. This not only involves high labor intensity and low production efficiency, but also makes it difficult to stabilize quality. To change this situation, it is necessary to revolutionize production methods and replace manual labor with machines in many processes. Only by realizing mechanization can we greatly liberate production capacity, increase output per unit area, and adapt to the current needs of the machinery industry's development.

    When mentioning foundry mechanization, some people think of the models of large factories such as the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, the Changchun First Automobile Plant, and the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Plant. These models may provide some inspiration for changing the backward state of casting, but if everyone follows these models to achieve mechanization, it will not only take a long time to build and require a large investment, but also be incompatible with China's current specific situation. Small and medium-sized machinery factories account for a large proportion in our country. Mechanically copying the set of large factories and pinning hopes on building large factories and buying foreign equipment will inevitably delay production and cause waste. We believe that the Great Leap Forward in foundry work must also take two legs to walk: on the one hand, we need big and foreign legs; on the other hand, we also need small and indigenous legs, as well as "indigenous and foreign" combined legs. The Hebei District Machinery Factory in Tianjin has vigorously launched a mechanization movement, boldly creating many mainly indigenous and indigenous-foreign combined foundry equipment and woodworking machinery, breaking through the shackles of dogmatism and changing the face of casting production. The vertical closed conveyor created by workers of the Tianjin Ninth Plumbing Factory has a simple structure and occupies a small area, but has the same effect as the horizontal conveyors of large machinery factories. It can be seen that there are also advanced things in the indigenous. If someone is enthusiastic about textbook conclusions, copies and pastes, and stubbornly links the indigenous with backwardness, it is obviously wrong.

    Aiming at the weak links in production, fully mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out technical revolution is the key to the current Great Leap Forward in foundry work. The Foundry Work Conference held by the First Ministry of Machine Building in Tianjin pointed out a clear road and direction for the mechanization of small and medium-sized foundry workshops across the country. It can be predicted that with the development of the mechanization movement across the country, foundry workers who have been engaged in manual operation for thousands of years will be liberated from heavy labor, and China's foundry workshops will gradually become clean, civilized, mechanized, and automated foundry workshops.

### 实现铸工机械化

    实现铸工机械化
    机械工业能不能大跃进，它的第一道关口是要看铸工生产能不能赶上去？各种机器设备首先需要的是大量的铸件。一般机器，铸件重量要占机器体重的50％—80％。推广以铁代钢、以铸代锻之后，铸件需要量有增无已。这就要求铸件生产必须相适应地跟上。
    目前我国机器制造业中，除几个大城市的少数机器厂实现了铸工机械化以外，绝大部分中小型工厂的铸工车间都是采用手工操作。不仅劳动强度大、生产效率低，而且质量也不易稳定。要改变这种局面，就要在生产方式上进行革命，在许多工序上以机器代手工。只有实现机械化，才有可能大大解放生产能力，提高单位面积产量，才有可能适应当前机械工业发展的需要。
    提起铸工机械化，就有人想起沈阳第一机床厂、长春第一汽车厂、上海中国纺织机械厂等几个大型工厂的样板。这些样板对改变铸造落后状况会有一些启发，但是如果大家按这些样板去实现机械化，不仅建设时间很长、投资很大，而且同我国当前具体情况不相适应。我国中小型机械工厂占有很大的比重，机械地搬用大厂一套，把希望寄托在盖大厂房、买洋设备方面，势必延误生产，造成浪费。我们认为铸工大跃进也必须两条腿走路，一方面需要大的洋的腿；另一方面还需要小的土的以及“土洋”结合的腿；天津市河北区机械工厂大闹机械化运动，大胆地创造了许多以土为主、土洋结合的铸工设备及木工机械，冲破了教条主义的束缚，改变着铸造生产的面貌。天津市第九水暖厂工人创制的垂直封闭式输送器，构造简单，占地很小，同大型机械厂水平式的输送器具有同等效用。可见土中也有先进的东西，如果有人热衷于书本定论，照抄照搬，硬把土和落后连在一起，显然是错误的。
    针对生产薄弱环节，充分发动群众大闹技术革命是当前铸工大跃进关键。一机部在天津举行的铸工会议给全国中小铸工车间机械化问题指出了明确的道路和方向。可以预计随着全国各地大搞机械化运动的开展，几千年来手工操作的铸工将从笨重劳动中解放出来，我国铸工车间将逐渐成为清洁、文明、机械化自动化的铸工车间。
