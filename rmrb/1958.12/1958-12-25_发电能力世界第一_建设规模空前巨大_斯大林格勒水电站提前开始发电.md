Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: According to TASS, the world's largest Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station on the Volga River began generating electricity on December 22nd, a year ahead of schedule. Its first turbine sent its first batch of electricity to nearby industrial enterprises at 22:40 (Moscow time) on the same day.

The total power generation capacity of this hydroelectric power station is 2,563,000 kilowatts, which is 260,000 kilowatts more than the Lenin Volga Hydroelectric Power Station (formerly known as the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station), which was fully completed and put into production in August this year. Thus, it has become the world's largest hydroelectric power station already generating electricity.

The Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station will generate 11 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, and 14 billion kilowatt-hours in years with high water volume, which is almost one and a half times the electricity produced by all Soviet power stations in 1931.

Through the Stalingrad-Moscow high-voltage transmission line and the Stalingrad-Donbas high-voltage transmission line, the electricity generated by the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station will supply the Donbas, Moscow Oblast, Tambov Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, Ryazan Oblast, and the cities and villages in the adjacent Volga River basin. Rural areas receiving its power supply will be highly electrified.

The commissioning of this huge hydroelectric power station marks the near completion of the grand plan to transform the Volga River, which has been underway for more than 20 years. The completion of the hydroelectric power station will greatly change the face of the lower reaches of the Volga River. It will improve navigation conditions on the most important section of the Volga River transport route. The Stalingrad Reservoir will be 30 meters deep, and giant passenger and cargo ships will be able to navigate here. This reservoir will also greatly improve the irrigation of arid areas in the Volga River basin and near the Caspian Sea.

The decision to build the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station was made in 1950. During the construction process, 130 million cubic meters of soil were excavated and removed, and 4.4 million cubic meters of concrete were poured just for the construction of the hydroelectric power station dam. The builders excavated a 70-hectare foundation pit for the hydroelectric power station and erected a 4-kilometer-long cableway across the Volga River. Hundreds of various machines and mechanical devices worked simultaneously on the 120-square-kilometer hydroelectric power station construction site.

The British power engineer Mr. Sitrin, who visited this construction project, said that he had seen many construction projects in Italy, France, and the United States, but he had never seen such an amazing construction scale as the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station.

The Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station has a total of 22 turbines, each with a power generation capacity of 115,000 kilowatts. It takes three train cars to transport one of its turbines to the construction site. The hydroelectric power station's reservoir—the Stalingrad Reservoir—is one of the largest artificial seas in the Soviet Union, covering an area of more than 3,000 square kilometers after impoundment.

### 发电能力世界第一  建设规模空前巨大  斯大林格勒水电站提前开始发电

    发电能力世界第一  建设规模空前巨大
    斯大林格勒水电站提前开始发电
    新华社23日讯  据塔斯社报道：伏尔加河上全世界最大的斯大林格勒水电站已经提前一年在12月22日开始发电。它的第一台水轮机在当天二十二时四十分（莫斯科时间）向附近的工业企业送出了第一批电流。
    这座水电站的总发电能力为二百五十六万三千瓩，比今年8月全部建成和投入生产的列宁伏尔加水电站（旧称古比雪夫水电站）的发电能力还多二十六万瓩，这样，它就成为已经发电的世界上最大的水电站。
    斯大林格勒水电站每年将发电一百一十亿度，而在水量大的年份里将发电一百四十亿度，这差不多为1931年苏联所有发电站生产的电力的一倍半。
    通过斯大林格勒——莫斯科高压输电线和斯大林格勒——顿巴斯高压输电线，斯大林格勒水电站发出的电力将供应顿巴斯、莫斯科州、坦波夫州、沃罗涅日州、梁赞州和邻近的伏尔加河流域的城市和乡村，得到它的电力供应的农村地区将高度电气化。
    这座巨大的水电站的投入生产标志着已经进行了二十多年的改造伏尔加河的宏伟计划的接近完成。水电站的建成将使伏尔加河下游的面貌发生很大变化。它将改善伏尔加河运输干线最重要一段航线上的航运条件。斯大林格勒水库的深度将达三十公尺，巨型客轮和货轮将在这里通航。这个水库还将大大改进伏尔加河流域和里海附近低地的干旱地区的灌溉情况。
    斯大林格勒水电站是在1950年决定建设的。在建设过程中，单是建设水电站堤坝就挖出和移走了一亿三千万立方公尺的泥土，浇灌了四百四十万立方公尺的混凝土。建设者们挖掘了面积达七十公顷的水电站基坑，横过伏尔加河架设了一条四公里长的索道。在周围一百二十平方公里的水电站建筑工地上同时有数百台各种各样的机器和机械在工作。
    访问过这个建设工程的英国动力学家西特林说过，他曾在意大利、法国和美国看到许多建设工程，但从来没有看到过像斯大林格勒水电站那样惊人的建设规模。
    斯大林格勒水电站一共有二十二台水轮机，每台的发电能力为十一万五千瓩。要把它的一台水轮机运到建设工地需要三列火车车皮。水电站的水库——斯大林格勒水库是苏联最大的人造海之一，它蓄水后面积达三千平方公里以上。（附图片）
