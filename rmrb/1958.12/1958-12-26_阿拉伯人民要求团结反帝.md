    Iraqi Radio Points Out that Imperialism Tries to Create Divisions Among Countries
    Lebanese Arab Liberation Party Emphasizes Vigilance Against the Conspiracies of U.S. Imperialism
    Yemeni Crown Prince Badr Condemns Imperialism for Playing New Tricks

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 25th. Iraqi Republic Radio, on the 24th, published a commentary pointing out that Iraq believes all its measures are in line with the true interests of the Iraqi people, because its domestic policy reflects the democratic aspirations of the Iraqi people, and its foreign policy is consistent with the Iraqi people's desire to achieve the goal of free Arab nationalism. The radio emphasized that Iraq will continue to expose all attempts to undermine its security and its history, regardless of the motives behind such attempts, and regardless of where such attempts come from. It will never allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs.

    The radio pointed out that imperialist blocs have recently been playing all sorts of cunning tricks, trying to make people feel that they have changed their attitudes. They have made friendly gestures, attempting to make newly independent countries no longer deal with imperialism in a tough manner. However, liberated Arab countries have deeply realized from their own painful experiences that imperialism's ambitions are endless. Therefore, Iraq has adopted a policy of cooperation with all countries of different tendencies and different social and political systems. This cooperation must guarantee Iraq's independence. In cooperation, it adheres to the principles of non-interference in internal affairs, respect for national sovereignty, and mutual benefit. This is to safeguard Iraq's interests and world peace.

    The radio said that the imperialist blocs are unhappy with this policy of equal cooperation. They have launched massive attacks and distortions of the positions of national governments that uphold the interests of the people, attempting to deceive the world. The purpose of this deception offensive is to cover up the conspiracies planned by the imperialist blocs.

    The radio emphasized that, since the Iraqi Republic has affirmed that it is an integral part of the Arab nation as a whole, it will continue to advance towards the goal of achieving free Arab nationalism. No force can forcibly pull it out of the ranks of free Arabs.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Iraqi Republic Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 23rd, celebrating the victory of the Egyptian people over imperialist aggression. The commentary emphasized the importance of the great unity of the Arab people against imperialism and condemned the imperialists' attempts to conspire to subvert the government of the Iraqi Republic.

    The commentary quoted the telegram sent by Iraqi Republic Prime Minister Qasim to Arab United Republic President Nasser congratulating him on Victory Day, and pointed out that this telegram illustrates that "all countries in the great Arab homeland, whether during the bloody struggle in Port Said or today, should be closely united." The commentary said, "We see that the imperialist bloc is doing everything possible to isolate the Arab national revival movement, attempting to create rifts between the fighting people of this country and the fighting people of that country."

    The commentary also said, "The government, people, and army of the Iraqi Republic have decided to follow their own path and complete their glorious revolutionary mission, which no one can stop. The Iraqi Republic believes that relying on democratic methods to solve domestic and foreign affairs is the way to guarantee the realization of our revolutionary goals, that relying on the fraternal unity of the two major nationalities, Arab and Kurdish, is the way to guarantee the establishment of a national unity sufficient to purge agents, traitors, and conspirators from within, and that taking the path of Arab unity is the path that can unite all good forces that uphold the goals and unity of free Arab nationalism."

    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 24th. The "Struggle News" published a commentary by the Arab Liberation Party led by Lebanese Prime Minister Karami. The commentary said that the party believes that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree's visit to the Middle East "is of great significance, prompting us to remain vigilant and pay attention to the conspiracies of imperialism, mainly U.S. and British imperialism."

    The commentary said that the struggle against imperialism is the duty of Arab countries and must be done.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiz, December 24th. A mass rally was held here on the 23rd to celebrate the second anniversary of the Egyptian people's victory over the British, French, and Israeli aggression.

    Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Crown Prince Badr said at the meeting: "After that defeat, the imperialists are now trying to play new tricks. Perhaps they have forgotten that we know what imperialism and its tricks are. We have the power to fight back against imperialism and its tricks."

    Crown Prince Badr condemned the British conspiracy to establish a "federation" in Aden and other places in southern Yemen to link with the British Commonwealth. He said: "Everyone in both the north and south of Yemen is determined to liberate Aden. We will make Aden a second Port Said." His speech was frequently interrupted by applause and slogans such as "Long live the Great Arab Unity" and "Down with Imperialism."

    Yemeni member of the Arab United Federation Council, Weisi, said at the meeting that Egypt's victory over Britain, France, Israel, and their supporter, the United States, was not only Egypt's victory, but also the victory of all Arab countries and peace-loving people all over the world.

    UAE representative to Yemen, Desouki, said at the celebration held in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, on the 23rd that when Aden and the occupied southern Yemen are liberated from imperialist rule and return to the embrace of Yemen in the near future, a meeting will also be held to celebrate this victory day. He added that if all Arabs unite to fight imperialism, they will liberate places like Oman and Algeria.

    阿拉伯人民要求团结反帝
    伊拉克电台指出帝国主义力图在各国之间制造分裂
    黎巴嫩阿拉伯解放党强调警惕美国帝国主义的阴谋
    也门巴德尔王太子斥责帝国主义玩弄新的阴谋诡计
    新华社巴格达25日电  伊拉克共和国电台24日发表评论指出，伊拉克相信它的一切措施符合伊拉克人民的真正利益，因为它的对内政策反映了伊拉克人民的民主愿望，它的对外政策是和伊拉克人民渴望实现自由阿拉伯民族主义的目标一致的。电台强调说，伊拉克将继续揭露一切阴谋破坏它的安全和它的历史的企图。不管这种企图的动机如何，不管这种企图来自何方。它绝不允许任何人干涉它的内政。
    电台指出，帝国主义集团最近玩弄各式各样的狡诈手段，企图使人们觉得他们已经改变了态度。它们作出了友好的姿态，企图使新近获得独立的国家不再以强硬的态度来对付帝国主义。但是，解放了的阿拉伯国家从自己的痛苦经验中深深体会到，帝国主义的野心是无止境的。因此，伊拉克采取了同所有不同倾向和不同社会、政治制度的国家合作的政策。这种合作必须保证伊拉克的独立。它在合作中遵守不干涉内政、尊重民族主权和互利的原则。这是为了维护伊拉克的利益和世界和平。
    电台说，帝国主义集团不高兴这种平等合作的政策。它们大肆攻击和歪曲坚持人民利益的民族政府的立场，企图欺骗世人。这种欺骗攻势的目的，就是要给帝国主义集团策划的阴谋打掩护。
    电台强调说，但是，伊拉克共和国既已肯定它是阿拉伯民族整体的一部分，它就要继续朝着实现自由阿拉伯民族主义目标的道路前进。任何力量都不能把它从自由阿拉伯的队伍中硬拉出来。
    据新华社讯  伊拉克共和国电台在23日晚间广播的评论表示庆祝埃及人民战胜帝国主义侵略的胜利
  日。评论强调阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义的大团结的重要性，并且谴责帝国主义企图阴谋颠复伊拉克共和国政府。
    评论引述了伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆向阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔祝贺胜利日的电报，并且指出，这封电报说明，“阿拉伯大祖国各个国家，无论是在塞得港的流血斗争期间，或者是在今天，都应该紧密团结。”评论说，“我们看到帝国主义集团千方百计孤立阿拉伯民族的复兴运动，企图在这个国家的战斗人民和那个国家的战斗人民之间制造裂痕。”
    评论还说，“伊拉克共和国的政府、人民和军队已经决定要走自己的道路，完成它的光荣的革命的使命，这是任何人都不能阻挡的。伊拉克共和国认为依靠民主方式来解决内政和外交问题，是保证实现我们革命目标的方法，认为依靠阿拉伯和库尔德两个主要民族的友爱团结，是保证建立一个足以从内部肃清代理人、卖国贼和阴谋家的民族统一的办法，并且认为走阿拉伯团结的道路，是能够会合所有维护自由阿拉伯民族主义的目标和团结的善良力量的道路。”
    新华社贝鲁特24日电  “斗争报”刊载了黎巴嫩总理卡拉米领导的阿拉伯解放党发表的一篇评论。评论说，这个党认为，美国助理国务卿朗特里对中东的访问“具有重要的意义，它促使我们保持警惕，注意帝国主义，主要是美国和英国帝国主义的阴谋”。
    这篇评论说，反对帝国主义的斗争是阿拉伯国家的义务和必须作的事情。
    新华社塔兹24日电  这里在23日举行了一次群众大会，庆祝埃及人民击败英、法、以色列的侵略的两周年纪念日。
    也门王国副首相兼外交大臣巴德尔王太子在这次大会上讲话时说：“帝国主义者在那次失败以后，现在又企图玩弄新的阴谋诡计。也许他们忘了我们是懂得什么是帝国主义和它的诡计的。我们有力量反击帝国主义和它的诡计。”
    巴德尔王太子谴责英国阴谋在也门南部亚丁等地建立一个“联邦”来同英联邦联结在一起。他说：“也门南北部的每一个人都决心要解放亚丁。我们将使亚丁成为第二个塞得港。”他的讲话不时为掌声和“阿拉伯大团结万岁”、“打倒帝国主义”的口号声所打断。
    阿拉伯联合邦理事会也门委员韦西在大会上讲话说，埃及战胜英、法、以色列和它们的支持者美国，这不仅是埃及的胜利，而且也是所有阿拉伯国家和全世界爱好和平的人民的胜利。
    阿联驻也门代表德苏基23日在也门首都萨那举行的庆祝会上说，当亚丁和被占领的也门南部在不久的将来从帝国主义统治下获得解放回到也门的怀抱以后，也将举行庆祝这个胜利日的大会。他又说，所有的阿拉伯人团结起来向帝国主义进行斗争，他们就将使阿曼和阿尔及利亚等地得到解放。
