    Summary on the First Automobile Works' Vigorously Launching Mass Movements and Greatly Engaging in Technological Revolution
    Chinese Communist Party Jilin Provincial Committee

    Based on the rectification movement, with the spirit of continuous revolution, the Changchun First Automobile Works vigorously launched mass movements, emancipated thought, and boldly reformed rules and regulations, bringing about revolutionary changes in all aspects of the enterprise. A prominent manifestation of these changes is the mass movement of workers participating in design and greatly engaging in technological revolution.

    This movement began in late August of this year. Its goal is to increase production capacity from the originally designed 30,000 vehicles per year (50 vehicles per shift) to 150,000 vehicles per year (250 vehicles per shift) by 1959, without increasing state investment. Simultaneously, it aims to shift from single-product production to multi-product production and begin independently innovating new types of automobiles.

    This movement has led to a leap in production; however, the more significant gains are in the political realm. In the vigorous mass movement, the mindset of blindly believing in authority was shattered, and unreasonable rules and regulations that constrained the enthusiasm of the masses were eliminated. Replacing them was a flourishing of collectivism, a promotion of communist spirit, and an unprecedented increase in the prestige of the Party. Wherever the Party points, the masses will achieve it. The factory is moving in the direction of developing a new type of socialist enterprise.

    This movement was launched under the inspiration of the national Great Leap Forward and built upon the foundation of ten mass political and production movements within the factory over the past year. Since last winter, the factory has conducted numerous large-scale airing of views, free airing of views, big-character posters, and extensive debates. Each movement started with an ideological leap, promoted a production leap, and the production leap further promoted an ideological leap.

    Movement after Movement, Continuous Revolution, Continuous Leap Forward

    The rectification movement is the foundation of the Great Leap Forward and also an unprecedented and vigorous mass movement in the automobile factory. In the early stages of the rectification, after the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, the movement quickly shifted towards adjusting internal conflicts among employees. Of the tens of thousands of opinions raised by the masses through big-character posters, 80% were directed at the "three winds and five airs" in the leadership's work style, and unreasonable management systems and methods such as excessive concentration of power, mutual constraints among organizations at all levels, and a bloated organization.

    The essence of the "three winds and five airs" and unreasonable rules and regulations is a lack of trust in the masses and a failure to rely on the masses. If the work style does not change and unreasonable rules and regulations are not reformed, the relations of production cannot be adjusted, the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be promoted, and the productive forces cannot develop by leaps and bounds.

    The rectification movement has further promoted the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses. Among the cadres of the automobile factory, the "five togethers" and "three transformations" were implemented, workers participated in some aspects of daily management, and the organization was initially streamlined, cadres were transferred to lower levels, and power was delegated. Socialist and communist education was also widely conducted among the workers. A new relationship began to be established between cadres and workers, and the spiritual outlook of the enterprise greatly improved, sparking the production enthusiasm of all employees. The sentiment of the masses was: not only must we criticize fiercely, but we must also work fiercely.

    On the basis of mass mobilization, before the movement for 250 vehicles per shift, two production upsurges had already occurred, which were also two mass production movements. One was the movement to double production and achieve 100 vehicles per shift, and the other was the mass movement to strive for a technological leap forward and trial-produce the "Red Flag" luxury sedan.

    During the "Double Anti" movement, the factory Party committee, in accordance with the central government's instructions on the "Double Anti" movement: "... should guide cadres and masses in a timely manner to place the greatest attention and effort on actively improving work and developing production ...," first compiled the factory's long-term plan. The slogan at that time was: "Hard Struggle for Three Years, Increase Fivefold; Three Five-Year Plans, 300,000 Vehicles." This meant that compared to the annual production of 10,000 vehicles at the end of 1957, 60,000 vehicles were to be achieved by 1960. This was already a significant leap forward, and all employees were indeed inspired by this plan. However, once put into practice by the masses, this plan was quickly surpassed.

    The employees of the cab assembly section of the stamping workshop emancipated their minds and broke through the constraints of the design quota. They completed eight hours of quota in four hours, assembling more than fifty automobile cabs, reaching the level of 100 vehicles per shift. If the entire factory could do this, production capacity could leap from 30,000 vehicles per year to 70,000 vehicles per year. Their report of victory to the employee representative assembly shook the entire factory, and the majority of employees expressed their willingness to learn from them. The factory Party committee affirmed this achievement, supported the initiative of the masses, and decided to conduct a large-scale inspection of 100 vehicles per shift in all workshops throughout the factory.

    "100 Vehicles Per Shift" is a concentrated reflection of the will of the leadership and the masses. In order to achieve 100 vehicles per shift, in addition to relying on enthusiasm, it is also necessary to overcome the blind belief in the factory's design quotas and the weak links in production. This requires greatly emancipating the mind.

    The automobile factory is a new factory, and most of the workers, management cadres, and technical personnel are new and inexperienced. Some technical personnel understand some production knowledge, but many of them rigidly adhere to books and blindly believe in authority. The automobile factory is also a large-scale factory with complex production processes, and people are reluctant to easily change management and technical issues, even if they are known to be unreasonable. To mobilize the masses to engage in the movement for 100 vehicles per shift, it is necessary to remove all kinds of stumbling blocks that hinder the emancipation of thought; it is necessary to have the courage of continuous revolution and adopt the method of vigorously launching mass movements.

    The factory leadership recognized this problem and firmly grasped the key to vigorously launching mass movements and emancipating the mind, launching a production movement for 100 vehicles per shift. After this decision was conveyed, the enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high, with gongs and drums beating and a joyful atmosphere, and revolutionary initiatives appeared everywhere. The cutting speed of several milling machines in the chassis workshop, according to textbook theory, was a maximum of 35 meters per minute. Based on practical operating experience, the workers believed that this quota was too low and boldly accelerated the speed, improved the tools, and immediately jumped to 85 meters. In the past, planning was based on the production line with the weakest production capacity. Now, the masses proposed to emulate the most advanced levels and broke through the original production capacity. In the past, the supply and technical service departments were constrained by many old rules. When workshops needed materials or technical assistance, they went through three checks and five reviews, which were slow to resolve. This time, dozens of functional department heads went deep into the workshops, took the initiative to understand the needs of the workshops, and provided timely supply and assistance.

    This movement first experimented in groups and work sections and then developed into a factory-wide production upsurge. After half a month, the masses solved more than 2,000 production bottlenecks, and all workshops reached the level of 100 vehicles per shift. In the vigorous mass movement, they broke through the blind beliefs that "the highest technical level cannot be changed," "advanced quotas cannot be broken through," "rhythmic production cannot be disrupted," and "supervision and control of the workshop cannot be changed." This was the first major emancipation of the mind of the masses.

    Another production movement after the rectification movement was the mass movement to trial-produce the "Red Flag" luxury sedan. After successfully achieving the production leap forward of 100 vehicles per shift and successfully trial-producing the first domestic "East Wind" sedan, the thinking of all employees was further emancipated, their technology was further improved, and they all brewed to further master cutting-edge technology and trial-produce luxury sedans. At that time, the factory leadership was also studying multi-product production plans, so they immediately supported the opinions of the masses.

    Some people believed that according to the practices of various countries in the world, the trial production of new cars could only be the responsibility of specialized design departments. They would first propose plans and sketches, which would be submitted to the trial production workshop for trial production, the testing department for testing, and finally modified and finalized. These departments were completely divorced from the production practices of the vast number of workers in the daily production workshops. They rarely solicited the opinions of workers, and workers had no right to participate in the design. The trial production process of a new car generally took about a year and a half. This is a line that deviates from the masses, so it cannot develop production quickly, well, and economically.

    This incorrect technical thinking was reflected in the trial production of the "Red Flag" luxury sedan, forming a sharp contrast with the masses' thinking of high-speed leap forward. The trial production of the "Red Flag" was another emancipation of the mind of the masses. Those who opposed the mass movement said: "It is too difficult to manufacture luxury sedans, we don't have the conditions"; "We have to take it slowly, we must first have a detailed plan, we can't just do things with enthusiasm." However, the opinions of the workers and many technical personnel were completely opposite. They demanded "do it immediately"; "It should be made first, and then improved." The Party committee supported the opinions of the masses and held a "three-in-one" meeting with the participation of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers. First, they debated whether to do it, and then debated how many days it would take to complete it. While the meeting was being held indoors, the masses outside sent in big-character posters. Promoters at the meeting spoke one after another: "If the trial production workshop can trial-produce, our production workshop can also trial-produce," "We can produce Liberation trucks and we can also manufacture 'Red Flags'," "If we want to be fast, everyone has to do it." The opinions of the detractors were all refuted at the meeting. People said with confidence: "If one workshop does it, it will take several months; if the whole factory does it, it will only take one month."

    Based on the opinions of the masses, the factory Party committee decided to complete the design and trial production of the "Red Flag" within one month. Trial-producing a luxury sedan in one month is a heroic slogan, and it itself marks the victory of a new way of thinking.

    The debate had just ended, and before it had been mobilized throughout the factory, people were already taking action. The distribution of the trial production tasks was not done by first holding a scheduling meeting, but by disassembling the reference sample car, placing the physical parts on the table, and hanging the sketches on the wall, and holding a "temple fair" to "recruit talent." Regardless of whether they were workers or cadres, they all rushed to do it, and after the parts "snatched" back were completed, they were sent to the assembly parts place. The connection between upper and lower processes also broke away from the old practice of going back and forth through the scheduling department for balance, and instead, the workers took the initiative to cooperate and collaborate with each other. In one month, the "Red Flag" was successfully trial-produced.

    The "Red Flag" luxury sedan is a cutting-edge product of the automobile manufacturing industry, and many of the devices on the "Red Flag" had never been seen before. Brother factories in China provided great support, but some technical difficulties still had to be solved by ourselves. These difficulties did not stump the masses. Comrade Qian Yunzhou, an old worker in charge of manufacturing the hydraulic transmission, was greeted with cold words from the beginning: "The professors are not sure, this is not easy!" When the parts were made and tested, several tests failed, and more people "advised" him: "Take it easy! Install a mechanical transmission." Comrade Qian Yunzhou had firm confidence and said he would do what he said. He and engineer Liu Chuanjing worked together, failing one test and then trying a second, third... Later, they simply moved their bedding to the factory, and after getting tired, they would lie down for a while, and then get up to try again when they woke up; when they were hungry, they would eat something and then come back to work, testing and improving day and night, and testing again, finally succeeding in the test the night before the car was assembled.

    The successful trial production of the "Red Flag" broke the reliance on only a few technical personnel, only on specialized trial production departments, and the slow and so-called formal trial production process. It revealed a revolutionary road of relying on the masses, combining physical and mental labor, and trial-producing new types of automobiles at high speed. The successful trial production of the "Red Flag" made the factory leaders realize that mass movement methods could and must be used in technological transformation. It further emancipated the mind of all employees, grew communist ambition, improved production skills, and enhanced the confidence and determination to master cutting-edge technology and catch up with and surpass international levels. This opened the prelude to a further technological revolution.

    Workers Participate in Design, Greatly Engage in Technological Revolution, Vigorously Break Conservatism, and Vigorously Develop Production

    The general line of socialist construction is the concentration of the actions and will of the people of the whole country, and at the same time, it inspires the people of the whole country to fight for a higher speed of leap forward. The actual situation of the automobile factory is also like this. Although the victory of the movement for 100 vehicles per shift and the trial production of the "Red Flag" luxury sedan marked a great development of productive forces and a leap in technological level, no fundamental technological transformation had been carried out at that time, and the potential in this regard had not been deeply explored. After conveying the spirit of Chairman Mao's report on emancipating the mind, and after the central government put forward the call for technological revolution and cultural revolution, the thinking of the majority of employees was further emancipated, they had more enthusiasm, and the direction was clearer. The firepower of the mass movement naturally concentrated on technological revolution, striving for a high-speed leap forward. The movement for workers to participate in design, greatly engage in technological revolution, and leap forward to 250 vehicles per shift unfolded on this basis.

    The movement for 250 vehicles per shift had already sprouted in the trial production process of the "Red Flag." After the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, due to the requirements of the national situation, the factory Party committee further revised the long-term plan with the spirit of continuous revolution, requiring the goal of achieving an annual production of 150,000 vehicles (originally planned for 1967) to be realized in advance in 1962. This goal greatly excited the people. All employees guaranteed to realize the factory's leap forward plan ahead of schedule.

    The steering gear shell production group of the steering section of the chassis workshop first established a red banner. After the victory in the movement for 100 vehicles per shift, the comrades of the entire group carefully pondered and strove for a greater leap forward. After heated debate, the comrades of the entire group overcame the lack of confidence of some comrades and the ideas of conditionalism and skepticism, and boldly put forward the revolutionary slogan of "Digging Potential, Three No Increases (no increase in equipment, no increase in personnel, no increase in area), Striving to Achieve 250 Vehicles Per Shift (i.e., 150,000 Vehicles Per Year), Increasing Production Capacity Fivefold." Within three days, the eighteen workers in the group posted 290 big-character posters, identified six key problems, and concentrated their efforts to break through these keys. One worker, whose original quota was 15 minutes to process a part, adopted methods such as shortening auxiliary time, high-speed cutting, and merging processes, shortening it to 3 minutes and 8 seconds. Later, he proposed simplifying the geometric shape of the part and shortening the part by one section. If this suggestion were implemented, the processing time could be further shortened to 1 minute and 7 seconds. This raised a new question: can workers modify product designs? The factory director, who was conducting experimental fields in this work section, supported this approach and encouraged them to conduct a comprehensive study and innovation of product structure, equipment layout, and technological methods. According to this spirit, they carried out a comprehensive innovation from the above three aspects, and as a result, not only achieved the production capacity of 250 vehicles per shift, but also did not need to increase equipment, and could even free up three machine tools, 50 square meters of production area, and three workers. This was a red banner of continuous revolution that the masses themselves had planted under the inspiration of the spirit of the general line.

    The factory and workshop leaders held high the red banner of the steering gear shell group and fully piloted it in the entire steering section, achieving success. This shocked the entire factory, and many workshop leaders took the initiative to come to their work section to learn and conduct pilot projects in their own experimental fields. The second work section of the heat treatment workshop, the cylinder block and parts work section of the engine workshop, and others have all successfully tested.

    After the pilot project gained experience, the factory Party committee immediately decided to launch a large-scale mass movement throughout the factory to "Workers Participate in Design, Greatly Engage in Technological Revolution, and Leap Forward to 250 Vehicles Per Shift." The specific requirements of this movement are: maximize the potential, produce innovative, better-quality advanced models with the shortest time, the most economical production area, the least equipment, personnel, and funds, reach the production level of 150,000 vehicles per year, and call on workers to not only participate in some aspects of daily production management, but also participate in factory design, product design, and process design. It was decided that "automobile parts can be moved, technological methods can be changed, factory layouts can be changed, as long as it conforms to the general line of more, faster, better, and more economical."

    Because this was the universal desire of the masses, and there were several red banners as pacesetters, a massive and vigorous mass movement quickly unfolded after the factory employee representative assembly passed this resolution based on the decision of the factory Party committee. After two weeks of day and night hard work, all employees submitted 110,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 3,400 were major technological innovations directly related to achieving 250 vehicles per shift. The majority of employees, especially the working masses, were extremely excited. Some old workers said with emotion: "In the old society, we couldn't manage anything except cranking the handle. Today, the Party not only allows us to participate in management, but also mobilizes us to participate in design. The workers have truly become the masters of the enterprise, and we must not disappoint the Party's expectations!" Some workers said happily: "In the past, we always watched the peasants launch 'satellites,' and we felt a little ashamed. This time, let's also launch 'satellites'." Workers in auxiliary workshops were also very excited. They said: "If the basic workshops want to launch 'satellites,' we will build 'rockets,' and we will never let the 'satellites' wait for the 'rockets'!"

    If reforms to production and management require fighting against conservative thinking everywhere, then the struggle is even sharper on the issue of technological revolution. At that time, a few technical personnel believed: "Mass production must have a front and a rear. Design is the matter of rear personnel, and the quality of production depends on the design. A good design is like setting the type when printing a book. The front personnel, that is, the production workers, can rest assured that the printing is good and there will be no mistakes. Producers don't need to ask about design at all." That is to say, they believed that technology could only and should only be monopolized by a few people. This is purely a bourgeois ideology that sees workers as slaves to machines. The vast number of working masses waged a resolute struggle against this ideology and enthusiastically supported everyone engaging in design.

    There was also a group of detractors in the movement, including "prudent faction," "asking faction," "shaking head faction," and "counting accounts next year faction." They argued: "Technological revolution must have absolute certainty, otherwise it is easy to make accidents!" "250 vehicles per shift is easy to handle, just increase equipment and personnel fivefold!" The broad masses refuted these remarks with actual revolutionary actions. Forging and heat treatment workers proposed using rapid heating methods. Someone objected: "Engineers have tried it before, and it didn't work. They aren't stupid, if they can't do it, how can we do it?" But the masses didn't listen to this. The workers and some technical personnel fought hard for ten days and nights, making a series of reforms to the temperature control equipment and conveyor belt, and finally achieved the goal. The great wisdom and revolutionary actions of the masses left conditionalists and skeptics bruised and battered. The masses described the great victory on the ideological front by saying: "Ideological emancipation, ghosts and gods step aside."

    The flowers of the automobile factory's technological revolution are in full bloom. Now, every workshop has set up an exhibition room, displaying their achievements using various comparison methods. If the exhibition room is not big enough, it is placed on both sides of the workshop aisle. This is the crystallization of the wisdom of the masses, a review of communist style, and a 100-battle, 100-win arena set up against conservatism. These results are concentrated in four aspects: product revolution, process revolution, equipment revolution, and factory design revolution. The most important of these is the factory design revolution, which is the synthesis of the first three revolutions.

    Revolution in product design: After defeating superstition, the minds of the working masses were greatly liberated. As worker Mao Junjie said: "I now hold a skeptical attitude towards every part I produce and try my best to find ways to improve it."

    The broad masses have indeed discovered many product structures that are highly questionable. For example, a type of gearbox in the "Dodge" car has better performance, and some technical personnel once believed that it was a mass-produced product in the United States, and the design must be beyond reproach. However, when the workers were studying the advantages and disadvantages of various gearboxes, they quickly discovered that the shape of this product was complex and difficult to process, and realized that this was the result of designers being divorced from production practice. The workers' discovery won the complete conviction of the engineers. Now they are studying to change the process, so that the performance of the gearbox remains unchanged, but the production is very convenient.

    Recently, a new type of truck jointly designed and trial-produced by workers and technical personnel of the automobile factory concentratedly embodies the revolutionary spirit and wisdom of the masses. The universal joint, steel plate spring, etc. of this car have fundamentally changed the old methods that have always been used on trucks, simplifying many bulky structures. Compared with the original Liberation truck, the carrying capacity of this new car has increased by one ton, and the weight of the car itself has been reduced by half a ton. The reduction in weight can save a lot of metal and processing time. According to preliminary estimates, when the level of 150,000 vehicles per year is reached, the cost of each vehicle will be about half lower than this year's planned cost. The indicators such as horsepower and fuel consumption of this new type of automobile have surpassed the famous "Dodge" five-ton truck in the United States and reached the advanced level of international trucks.

    Revolution in process methods: In this movement, the masses put forward nearly 900 major process innovation measures, including a wide range of new technologies and cutting-edge technologies that have reached international levels. For example, for a long time, people believed that the casting workshop could not reach the production capacity of 250 vehicles per shift without adding annealing furnaces and other equipment. Someone said: "The annealing time is fixed, and if there are fewer furnaces, the annealing time will not be enough and it will be 'half-baked'. Unless the Monkey King is invited, it is necessary to expand." Adding furnaces is a major event. The existing annealing furnaces in the automobile factory are as tall as buildings, and the foundations, pipelines, and circuits are very complex projects. This problem did make many people troubled. But the masses were not intimidated. With the hard work of the leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel in the workshop, it was successfully tested to add two special raw materials to the molten iron, which increased the annealing efficiency by two times, saving more than 3,000 square meters of the area originally planned for expansion and 8 million yuan in funds. This greatly boosted people's morale and enthusiasm, and good news kept coming. The workshop employees proudly said: "We have surpassed the Monkey King."

    Equipment revolution: Breaking the old concept that everything must be precise, versatile, and use foreign machine tools, establishing the idea of combining indigenous and foreign methods in modern large enterprises, and a trend of equipment revolution has emerged. Its trend is: people should be versatile, and equipment should be simplified.

    In addition to dedicated equipment, there are also a large number of universal machine tools on the automobile factory's production line. These machine tools only process one process on a large-scale assembly line, using only one function of their versatility. Workers describe these universal machine tools as "very valuable, but heroes have no place to use." The work of these machine tools can be completely replaced by efficient and simple process machine tools. Simple machine tools have a simple structure, low cost, fast manufacturing, and high efficiency. After using simple machine tools, universal machine tools can also be freed up to give full play to their role as working machine tools. It can also free up part of the factory area.

    The comrades in the chassis workshop designed a six-axis tapping machine by themselves, and it only took 13 days to make it using waste materials. This tapping machine replaced six universal drilling machines worth tens of thousands of yuan. During the movement, the masses made a large number of various simple machine tools. This is a major reform by the masses, which conforms to the development law of mechanical equipment from simple to complex, and from complex to simple.

    Factory design revolution: Product revolution, process revolution, and equipment revolution will inevitably promote fundamental reforms in factory design. The factory design plan put forward by workers after participating in the design is also a revolutionary plan, which implements the spirit of the general line. According to the current progress, the entire factory can reach the annual production of 150,000 vehicles before the National Day next year, eight years ahead of the original leap forward plan. When the annual output of the automobile factory increases to 150,000 vehicles, the output of each worker per year is about ten vehicles, which reaches the level of the highest labor productivity in the world's automobile industry.

    The automobile factory was originally designed to produce 30,000 vehicles per year, and the total investment in the construction of the factory was 600 million yuan. After the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, when the factory Party committee decided to realize the plan of 150,000 vehicles per year ahead of schedule, it also organized a group of technical personnel to calculate the accounts. According to their estimates, to reach 150,000 vehicles per year, it is still necessary to add 3,700 sets of equipment, expand the area by 300,000 square meters, and invest about 300 million yuan. However, based on the results of the product, process, and equipment revolution, the factory design of 150,000 vehicles per year, collectively created by the masses in the technological revolution, only needs to add 800 sets of equipment, expand the area by 90,000 square meters, and invest 40 million yuan. All of these equipment can be self-made, and the investment can also be solved by drawing profits from the enterprise.

    The general factory design only includes technical and economic indicators, and only stipulates what equipment to use, what products to manufacture, how much to produce, etc. That is to say, only the "things" are designed. The new factory design of the automobile factory is not only that, but also embodies the political direction and fully estimates the dynamism of people. According to the new design plan, the workshops of the automobile factory will not only be production workshops, but also design, trial production, and scientific research workshops. Every worker in the workshop has the potential to develop in the direction of all-round development with multiple skills and the combination of physical and mental labor.

    The factory design of the automobile factory takes into account the development direction of the enterprise, and is gradually turning the factory into a comprehensive joint enterprise in a planned way according to the instructions of Chairman Mao. According to the needs of the state and internal production, steel smelting plants, cement plants, and building materials plants have been newly built, and machine tool plants and motor plants are also being planned on the basis of repair workshops.

    The mass movement of 250 vehicles per shift has only started the first round, and it has already achieved remarkable results. The practice of the movement has further educated and improved the masses. In this movement, the political thinking and technical and cultural level of the masses have been significantly improved, the spirit of collectivism and communism has been promoted, a "guerrilla" style full of revolutionary spirit has emerged, that is, a selfless labor style. The leadership level and management methods of the enterprise have also been further improved. Therefore, this is also a comprehensive revolution in the automobile factory.

    Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations

    An important sign of the automobile factory's progress on the road of comprehensive enterprise revolution is the further implementation of the Party's policy of running enterprises by relying on all employees, and the implementation of two participations, one reform, and three combinations.

    Two participations (cadres participate in labor, workers participate in management), one reform (reform of unreasonable rules and regulations), and three combinations (combination of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel) are the best forms of leadership and masses combining, politics and economics combining, and technical theory and production practice combining. They are successful experiences that have been effectively implemented in enterprises throughout the country. The Party Central Committee pointed out: Two participations, one reform, and three combinations should become the fundamental system of socialist enterprises in our country. The automobile factory learned from the experience of brother enterprises, boldly mobilized the masses in this movement, and further conducted some bold experiments, using new facts to prove that a comprehensive implementation of this system can quickly bring about a brand-new look to the enterprise and promote the great development of productive forces.

    The basic spirit of two participations, one reform, and three combinations is: under the leadership of the Party, implement the three combinations of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, closely rely on the working class, unite and educate technical personnel, vigorously launch mass movements, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all employees to run the enterprise vigorously. This is fundamentally opposed to certain unreasonable management systems existing in enterprises.

    In the rectification movement, the automobile factory implemented the instructions of the Central Committee, and cadres regularly participated in labor. In several experimental fields, it began pilot projects for workers to participate in daily production management. In May of this year, it further learned from the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory, comprehensively implemented two participations and one reform, canceled the leadership at the work section level, and established 702 production management groups; it initially carried out the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations; and proposed that cadres choose a labor as a "second occupation." For more than half a year, as a result of implementing two participations and one reform, the factory's cadres and masses have become more aware of the important significance of two participations and one reform. Through the mass movements of 100 vehicles per shift and 250 vehicles per shift, the scope of "participation" and "reform" has been expanded, and a new situation has emerged in which cadres universally participate in labor production and workers comprehensively participate in management, promoting the new fashion of three combinations.

    Although the participation of cadres in labor in the automobile factory is still not enough and must be continuously strengthened to make it systematic and regular, the results of the implementation have fully demonstrated the important significance of cadres' participation in labor.

    Cadres participating in labor requires cadres to put down their airs, eliminate the "three winds and five airs," and go to the masses and labor in the attitude of ordinary workers, to train and transform themselves. The implementation of this article is a concrete manifestation of the socialist ideological revolution for the cadres themselves, and the most practical and vivid communist education for the workers. The education of action has greater persuasiveness than the education of language. Cadres work side by side with workers in an equal posture, and the comradeship and comradeship of cadres and workers in the common socialist cause are concretely displayed; certain gaps existing between cadres and the masses, and the incorrect view that some workers think that cadres are "officials" and workers are "managed" are quickly changed. The workers' sense of honor in labor, sense of responsibility as masters, and enthusiasm for production and management are significantly enhanced. Precisely because of this, production can be done well, and workers can also manage well when they participate in management.

    In the automobile factory, some cadres once suspected that cadres' participation in labor would weaken the role of centralized leadership. At that time, they did not understand that the basic principle of socialist enterprise management is the mass line, and whether the leadership role is strengthened or weakened depends on whether the leaders take the mass line. They did not understand that cadres' participation in labor is the best leading method of the mass line. Facts have proved that as long as cadres regularly and frequently participate in labor, and can strictly abide by labor discipline, listen to production commands, learn production skills, and integrate with the workers, further familiarize themselves with the production situation, understand the key problems in production, grasp the ideological trends of the masses, know what the masses are doing, thinking, what difficulties they have, what their opinions are, and truly become participants and leaders of the three combinations, they can truly help lower levels and the masses solve problems and truly lead the masses. This is an in-depth and effective leadership. Cadres' participation in labor is a key issue for improving the communist consciousness of the masses, for carrying out mass movements, and for running enterprises well; and conscientiously implementing cadres' participation in labor is the decisive link in implementing two participations, one reform, and three combinations.

    In the initial stage, workers' participation in management in the automobile factory was limited to managing daily production affairs. This time, the large-scale mass movement has led workers to further participate in design and technical management, completely breaking the erroneous argument that "workers cannot participate in technical leadership." Like in other aspects, the influence of bourgeois ideology has not been eliminated in the design work in the enterprise, and this field of work is actually a stubborn fortress where bourgeois technical ideas hide. Workers' comprehensive participation in management in the production, economic, and technical aspects of the enterprise marks a further reflection of the characteristics of socialist enterprises in the management system. Workers' participation in design and technical management is a new thing full of vitality. Socialist enterprises are developing by leaps and bounds, and no aspect of work can be adapted to the knowledge and talents of a single individual or a few people. The combination of technical design work with the experience and wisdom of the broad working masses is an inevitable trend.

    "Participation" further, "reform" must also go further. In order to make the technical management system adaptable to the current new situation, and most conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, it must be thoroughly reformed. In the automobile factory, the comprehensive reform of the technical management system needs to be further studied, but through this movement, the following two questions can be clarified:

    I. The contradiction and unity between the technical front and the rear, production and technology. For a long time, the automobile factory has had a situation where the rear (professional technical departments) formulate technical documents, and the front (producers) can only draw gourds according to the model, because the new things created in the previous production practice cannot be reflected and enriched in the technical data. A small number of people in the rear bear a large and complex task, and also feel weak. Some technical problems have not been solved for a long time, and there are many topics to be studied, many levels, and cannot be promoted. This situation has changed in the movement. Now the automobile factory has decided on the following measures:

    1. Workers and technical personnel in the production workshop have certain powers to improve the structure of automobiles, tools, and equipment. In order to fix workers' participation in design in the system, one or several design and trial production staff members are added to the workers' democratic management group.

    2. Production personnel also engage in some process design and tool design work, and also engage in some tool manufacturing. Process personnel also engage in some product design work. Change the working relationship of mutual distrust between design, process, and production personnel. People are versatile, and the division of labor should not be too detailed.

    关于第一汽车制造厂  大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命的总结
    中国共产党吉林省委员会
    长春第一汽车制造厂在整风运动的基础上，以不断革命的精神，大搞群众运动，解放思想，大胆改革规章制度，使企业各方面开始了革命性的变化。变化的突出表现，是工人参加设计、大闹技术革命的群众运动。
    这个运动是从今年8月下旬开始的。它的目标是在不增加国家投资的条件下，在1959年内，使生产能力由原设计的年产三万辆（班产五十辆）跃进到十五万辆（班产二百五十辆），同时由单一品种生产转向多品种生产，并开始独创新型汽车。
    这个运动使生产获得了飞跃的发展；而更重要的收获则是在政治方面。在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，迷信权威的思想被打垮了，束缚群众积极性的不合理的规章制度被破除了；代之而起的是集体主义精神焕发，共产主义风格大张，党的威信空前提高。党指向那里，群众就做到那里。工厂正沿着新型社会主义企业的发展方向迈进。
    这个运动是在全国大跃进的鼓舞下，在厂内一年多来十次群众性的政治和生产运动的基础上掀起的。从去年冬天以来，全厂就展开了多次大鸣、大放、大字报和大辩论。每次运动都是从思想跃进开始，推动生产跃进，而生产跃进又进一步推动思想跃进。
    运动接运动，不断革命，不断跃进
    整风运动是大跃进的基础，也是汽车厂空前一次蓬勃的群众运动。在整风初期，在反右派斗争胜利之后，运动就迅速转向调整职工内部矛盾方面。群众用大字报提出的十几万条意见，80％都针对着领导作风中的三风五气，和权力过度集中、各级组织互相牵制、机构庞大等不合理的管理制度和管理方法。
    三风五气、不合理的规章制度，其实质都是不相信群众和不依靠群众。作风不变，不合理的规章制度不改，生产关系就不能调整，群众的积极性就不能发扬，生产力就不能飞跃发展。
    整风运动使我们党的密切联系群众的优良传统得到了进一步的发扬。在汽车厂的干部中，实行了“五同”、“三化”，工人参加了一部分日常管理，并初步精简了机构，下放了干部，下放了权力，在工人群众中也广泛地进行了社会主义和共产主义的教育。干部和工人之间开始建立了新的关系，企业的精神面貌大为改观，全厂职工的生产热情焕发。群众的情绪是：不仅要狠狠地反，还要狠狠地干。
    在群众发动的基础上，在班产二百五十辆的运动之前，就已经先后出现了两个生产高潮，也是两次群众性的生产运动。一个是争取生产翻一番的班产百辆运动，一个是争取技术大跃进的试制“红旗”牌高级轿车的群众运动。    在双反运动中，工厂党委根据中央关于双反运动的指示：“……应该适时地引导干部和群众，把最大的注意力和干劲，放在积极地改进工作、发展生产方面……”，第一次编制了工厂的远景规划，当时的口号是：苦战三年增五倍，三个五年三十万。这就是说，同1957年年底年产一万辆份相比，1960年要达到六万辆。这已经是一个很大的跃进，全厂职工也确实被这个计划所鼓舞了。但是一经群众的实践，这个计划又很快地被突破了。
    冲压车间驾驶室装配工部的职工解放了思想，冲破了设计定额的束缚。他们在四个小时内完成了八个小时的定额，装出了五十多辆汽车驾驶室，达到了班产百辆的水平。如果全厂都能这样，生产能力就能由年产三万辆跃到年产七万辆。他们向职工代表大会的报捷震动了全厂，广大职工纷纷表示要向他们学习。工厂党委肯定了这个成绩，支持了群众的创举，决定在全厂各车间进行一次班产百辆的大检阅。
    “班产百辆”是领导和群众意志的集中反映。为了实现班产百辆，除了依靠干劲，还需要克服对工厂设计定额的迷信和生产上的薄弱环节。这就需要大大地解放思想。
    汽车厂是个新厂，大部分工人、管理干部和技术人员都是新人新手，缺乏经验。有一部分技术人员懂得些生产知识，但他们中间有许多人死扣书本，迷信权威。汽车厂又是一个规模较大、生产过程复杂的工厂，人们对管理和技术上的问题，即使明知是不合理的，也不敢轻易变动。要发动群众搞班产百辆运动，就必须搬掉各式各样阻碍思想解放的绊脚石；必须有不断革命的魄力，采用大搞群众运动的方法。
    工厂的领导认识了这个问题，紧紧抓住了大搞群众运动和解放思想的纲，掀起了一次班产百辆的生产运动。这个决定传达以后，群众情绪非常热烈，敲锣打鼓，喜气洋洋，到处出现革命性的创举。底盘车间几台铣齿机的切削速度，按书本理论每分钟最高是三十五公尺，工人们根据实际操作的经验，认为这个定额太低，大胆加快了转速，改进了工具，一下就跃到八十五公尺。过去编制计划都是以生产能力最薄弱的生产线做标准，现在群众提出要向最先进的水平看齐，并纷纷突破了原有的生产能力。过去供应部门和技术服务部门为很多陈规所束缚，车间需要材料或技术帮助时，三查五审，迟迟不能解决；这次，几十位职能处长都深入车间，主动了解车间的要求，及时给以供应和帮助。
    这一运动首先是在小组和工部试验，进而发展为全厂的生产热潮。前后经过半个月，群众解决了两千多个生产关键，各车间都达到了班产百辆的水平。在轰轰烈烈地群众运动中，冲破了“最高技术水平不敢更动”，“先进定额不敢突破”，“有节奏生产不敢打乱”，“对车间的监督控制不能变更”等迷信。这是群众思想的第一次大解放。
    整风后的另一次生产运动，是试制“红旗”牌高级轿车的群众运动。全厂职工在胜利实现了班产百辆的生产跃进和试制成功国产第一辆“东风”牌轿车后，思想进一步解放了，技术进一步提高了，纷纷酝酿要进一步掌握尖端技术，试制高级轿车。当时工厂领导也正在研究多品种生产方案，便立即支持了群众的意见。
    有人认为，按世界各国的惯例，新车试制只能由专门的设计部门负责，他们先提出方案和草图，交试制车间试制，试验部门试验，最后修改、定型。这些部门同日常生产车间广大工人的生产实践完全脱离。他们很少征求工人意见，工人也无权参与设计，一辆新车的试制过程一般总得一年半左右的时间。这是脱离群众的路线，当然也就不能多快好省地发展生产。
    这种不正确的技术思想，在“红旗”牌高级轿车的试制中反映出来，与群众高速跃进的思想形成了鲜明的对立面。“红旗”的试制，是群众思想的又一次解放。反对搞群众运动的人们说：“制造高级轿车太困难了，我们没有条件”；“要慢慢来，先要有个详细方案，不能只凭热情办事”。可是工人和不少职技人员的意见却完全相反，他们要求“马上搞”；“应该先搞出来，有了再改进”。党委支持了群众的意见，开了个三结合会，领导干部、技职人员和工人都参加。先辩论干不干，再辩论几天完。屋里开会，屋外群众送来了大字报。会上促进派纷纷发言：“试制车间能试制，我们生产车间也可以试制”，“我们能生产解放牌也能制造‘红旗’”，“要快就得大家干”。促退派的意见在会上都被驳倒了。人们满怀信心地说：“一个车间干要几个月，全厂干只要一个月”。
    工厂党委根据群众的意见决定一个月内完成“红旗”的设计、试制任务。一个月试制出一辆高级轿车，这是个豪迈的口号，他本身就标志着一种新的思想的胜利。
    辩论会刚刚开完，还没有在全厂动员，人们就已经行动起来了。试制任务的分配不是先开调度会议，而是把参考样车拆开，将零件实物往桌上一摆，草图往墙上一挂，开“庙会”，“张榜招贤”。不管工人、干部都抢着干，“抢”回去的零件做完后再送到装配部件的地方。上下工序的衔接也打破了经过调度部门往返平衡的老做法，而代之以工人们主动地互相配合和互相协作。一个月的时间，“红旗”试制成功了。
    “红旗”牌高级轿车是汽车制造工业的尖端产品，“红旗”上的很多装置，过去都是没有见过的。国内兄弟厂给了极大的支援，但是有一些技术困难还要自己解决。这些难关并没有难倒群众。担任制造液压变速箱的老工人钱云洲同志，在开始就有人冷言冷语地说：“教授们也没把握，这可不容易啊！”等到零件制成进行试验时，几次试验都失败了，又有更多人“劝”他：“太平些吧！装个机械变速箱算了”。钱云洲同志信心坚定，说到就得做到。他和刘传经工程师一起，一次试验不成功来第二次，第三次……。以后索性把被子搬到厂里，累了，躺一会，醒来再试；饿了，吃点东西，回来再干，不分昼夜地试验、改进，再试验，终于在汽车进行总装配的前一天晚上试验成功。
    “红旗”试制的成功，打破了只依靠少数技术人员、只依靠专业试制部门和迟缓的而又是所谓正规的试制过程；启示了一条富有革命性的依靠群众的、体力脑力劳动结合的、高速试制新型汽车的道路。“红旗”的试制成功，使工厂领导者体会了在技术改造方面也可能和必须用群众运动的方法。并在全厂职工中进一步解放了思想，长了共产主义志气，提高了生产技能，增强了掌握尖端技术以及赶上和超过国际水平的信心和决心。这就为进一步的技术大革命揭开了序幕。
    工人参加设计，大闹技术革命，大破保守主义，大力发展生产
    社会主义建设的总路线，是全国人民大跃进的行动和意志的集中，同时它又鼓舞了全国人民为争取更高速度的跃进而斗争。汽车厂的实际也是如此。班产百辆运动和试制“红旗”牌高级轿车的胜利，虽然标志了生产力的大发展和技术水平的跃进，但当时还没有进行技术上的根本改造，这一方面的潜力还没有深入挖掘。在传达了毛主席关于解放思想报告的精神，以及中央提出技术革命和文化革命的号召以后，广大职工的思想更加解放了，干劲更足了，方向更明确了。群众运动的火力很自然地集中到技术革命方面来，力争高速度跃进。工人参加设计，大闹技术革命，向班产二百五十辆跃进的运动就是在这个基础上展开的。
    班产二百五十辆的运动，在“红旗”试制过程中就已有萌芽。中共“八大”二次会议以后，由于全国形势的要求，工厂党委以不断革命的精神进一步修改了远景规划，要求提前在1962年实现年产十五万辆的目标（原计划是1967年）。这个奋斗目标大大激动了人心。全厂职工纷纷保证提前实现工厂的跃进规划。
    底盘车间转向工部的转向器壳生产小组首先树立了一面红旗。他们全小组的同志在班产百辆运动取得胜利以后，就细心琢磨，争取更大跃进。全组同志经过热烈辩论，克服了部分同志信心不足和唯条件论、怀疑论等思想，大胆地提出了“挖潜力、三不加（不加设备、不加人、不加面积），力争达到班产二百五十辆（即年产十五万辆），生产能力增五倍”的革命口号。全组十八个工人在三天内就贴出了二百九十张大字报，查出了六个关键问题，并集中精力突破这些关键。有一个工人，原定额是十五分钟加工一个零件，他采取了缩短辅助时间、高速切削、合并工序等方法，缩短到三分八秒。以后他又提出简化零件几何形状、把零件缩短一节的建议。如果实现了这个建议，加工时间就能进一步缩短到一分七秒。这就提出了一个新问题：工人可否修改产品设计？在这个工部搞试验田的厂长支持了这个做法，并鼓励他们对产品结构、设备平面布置和工艺方法进行全面研究和革新。根据这个精神，他们从以上三方面进行了全面革新，结果是不但达到了班产二百五十辆的生产能力，不仅不需要增加设备，还可以腾出机床三台、生产面积五十平方公尺和工人三名。这是在总路线的精神鼓舞下，群众自己插上的一面不断革命的红旗。
    厂与车间的领导高举了转向器壳小组的这面红旗，又在整个转向工部全面试点，获得成功。这就轰动了全厂，很多车间的领导干部都自动到他们工部来学习，并在自己的试验田里进行试点。在热处理车间第二工部，发动机车间的汽缸体和零件工部等都先后试验成功。
    试点取得了经验，厂党委立即决定在全厂展开“工人参加设计，大闹技术革命，向班产二百五十辆跃进”的大规模群众运动。这个运动的具体要求是：最大限度挖潜力，以最短的时间、最经济的生产面积、最少的设备、人员和资金，生产出独创的质量更好的先进车型，达到年产十五万辆的生产水平，并号召工人不仅要参加一部分日常生产管理，还要参加工厂设计、产品设计和工艺设计。决定“汽车零件可以动，工艺方法可以改，工厂布置可以变，只要符合多快好省的总路线”。
    由于这是群众的普遍愿望，又有几面红旗作标兵，所以当工厂职工代表大会根据厂党委的决定通过了这项决议后，一个声势浩大、轰轰烈烈的群众运动就迅速展开了。经过两个星期的昼夜苦战，全厂职工就提出了十一万条合理化建议，其中有三千四百多项是同实现班产二百五十辆直接有关的重大技术革新。广大职工特别是工人群众兴奋万分。有的老工人感动地说：“旧社会我们除了捏摇手柄，别的什么也管不着，今天党不但让我们参加管理，还动员我们参加设计，工人真正变成了企业的主人翁，我们一定不能辜负党的希望！”有的工人高兴地说：“过去总看农民放‘卫星’，心里有些惭愧，这回咱们也来放‘卫星’啦”，辅助车间工人也十分激动，他们说：“基本车间要放‘卫星’，我们就造‘火箭’，决不让‘卫星’等‘火箭’！”
    如果说对生产和管理的改革，处处要同保守思想作斗争，那么在技术革命问题上，斗争就更加尖锐。当时，有少数技职人员认为：“大量生产一定要分前后方。设计是后方人员的事，生产的好坏决定于设计。设计好了就好像印书时已经排好了版一样，前方人员亦即生产工人，尽管放心印好了，不会错。生产者根本用不着过问设计问题。”这就是说，他们认为技术只可能和只应该垄断在少数人手里。这纯粹是一种把工人看做机器的奴隶的资产阶级思想。广大工人群众同这种思想作了坚决斗争，热烈赞成大家搞设计。
    还有一批运动中的促退派，其中有“慎重派”、“伸手派”、“心里摇头派”、“明年算账派”等。他们纷纷议论道：“技术革命得有绝对把握，否则很容易革出事故来！”“班产二百五十辆也好办，只要设备人员加五倍！”广大群众用实际的革命行动驳倒了这些言论。锻工热处理工人提出采用快速加热的办法，有人反对说：“以前工程师们都试过，结果是不行。他们又不是傻子，他们不行，我们还行吗？”但群众没有听这一些，工人和一部分技术人员一道苦战了十昼夜，把控温设备和运输带等作了一系列改革后，终于达到了目的。群众的伟大智慧和革命行动，使唯条件论和怀疑论者碰得头破血流。群众在描述思想战线上的伟大胜利时说：“思想解放，鬼神退位。”
    汽车厂技术革命的花朵盛开了。现在，每一个车间都布置了展览室，用各种对比的办法展出他们的成就。展览室摆不开，就摆在车间的走道两边。这是群众智慧的结晶，是共产主义风格的检阅，是针对保守主义摆下的一个百战百胜的擂台。这些成果，集中表现在产品革命、工艺革命、设备革命和工厂设计革命四个方面。其中最重要的要数工厂设计革命，它是前三个革命的总成。
    产品设计的革命：在战胜了迷信以后，工人群众的思想大解放了。就像工人毛俊杰所说的：“我现在对自己生产的每一个零件都抱着怀疑态度，尽量寻找方法来改进它”。
    广大群众的确发现了很多大可怀疑的产品结构。比如“道奇”车的一种变速箱，性能较好，某些技术人员曾认为它是美国大量生产的产品，设计一定也无可非议。但是工人们在研究各种变速箱的优劣时，很快就发现这种产品的形状复杂，加工很不方便，看出这是设计人员脱离生产实践的结果。工人的发现赢得了工程师的完全信服。现在他们正在研究改变工艺，使变速箱的性能不变，而生产又很方便。
    最近，汽车厂工人和技术人员共同设计和试制成功的一种新型卡车，集中地表现了群众的革命精神和智慧。这辆汽车的万向节、钢板弹簧等，都根本改变了载重汽车上一直沿用的老办法，简化了很多笨重的结构，同原解放牌汽车相比，这辆新车的载重量增加了一吨，汽车本身的重量减轻半吨。自重的减轻，就能节省大量金属和加工时间。据初步估计，当达到年产十五万辆水平时，每辆汽车的成本比今年的计划成本将降低一半左右。这种新型汽车在马力、耗油量等指标上，都超过了美国有名的“道奇”五吨载重车，达到了国际载重汽车的先进水平。
    工艺方法的革命：在这次运动中，群众提出的重大工艺革新措施将近九百项，其中达到国际水平的新技术和尖端技术琳琅满目。例如：长久以来，人们认为铸工车间不增加退火炉等设备就不能达到班产二百五十辆的生产能力。有人说：“退火时间是固定的，炉子少了，退火时间不够就会‘夹生’。除非请齐天大圣来，否则就一定要扩建”。而增加炉子却是一件大事。汽车厂现有的几台退火炉，像楼房一样高大，打地基，安管道，敷线路，都是十分复杂的工程。这个问题的确使很多人苦恼。但是群众并没有被吓倒。在车间的领导干部、工人和技术人员一起苦战下，试验成功在铁水里加两种特殊原料，提高退火效率两倍，节约了原准备扩建的面积三千多平方公尺和资金八百万元。这一下人心大振，干劲十足，捷报频传。车间职工自豪地说：“咱们胜过了齐天大圣”。
    设备革命：打破了处处要精密、万能和国外机床的旧观念，树立了在现代化大企业中土洋结合的思想，出现了设备大革命的苗头。它的趋势是：人要万能化，设备要简单化。
    汽车厂的生产线上，除了专用设备以外，还有很大一部分万能机床。这些机床在大量流水生产线上只加工某一道工序，只用了它万能中的一能。工人形容这些万能机床是“身价很大，但英雄无用武之地。”这些机床的工作，完全可以用高效简易工序机床来代替。简易机床结构简单，成本低，制造快，效率高。使用简易机床后，还可以腾出万能机床，使它们充分发挥工作母机的作用。也可以腾出一部分厂房面积。
    底盘车间的同志们自己设计了一台六轴攻丝机，利用废料，只花了十三天就制成了。这台攻丝机代替了六台价值数万元的万能钻床。运动中，群众制成了一大批的各种简易机床。这是群众的一项重大改革，符合机械设备由简单到复杂、又由复杂到简单的发展规律。
    工厂设计革命：产品革命、工艺革命、设备革命，必然促进工厂设计的根本改革。汽车厂工人参加设计后提出的工厂设计方案，也是一个革命的方案，贯彻了总路线精神。依据目前的进度计算，在明年国庆节前，全厂就可以达到年产十五万辆，比原拟的跃进计划提前八年。汽车厂的年产量增至十五万辆的时候，每一工人每年的产量约为十辆，这就达到了世界汽车工业最高劳动生产率的水平。
    汽车厂按原设计是年产三万辆，建厂投资共六亿元。在中共“八大”二次会议以后，工厂党委决定提前实现年产十五万辆规划时，也曾组织了一批技术人员算了个账，根据他们的估算，达到年产十五万辆尚需增加设备三千七百台，扩大面积三十万平方公尺，投资三亿元左右。然而，群众在大闹技术革命的基础上，根据产品、工艺、设备革命后的成果，集体创造的年产十五万辆的工厂设计，却只需增加设备八百台，扩大面积九万平方公尺，投资四千万元。这些设备可以全部自制，投资也可从企业利润提成中自行解决。
    一般的工厂设计，只包括技术和经济指标，只规定用什么设备、制造什么产品、生产多少东西，等等。这就是说，只设计了“物”的方面。而汽车厂新的工厂设计则不仅如此，它还体现了政治方向，并充分估计到人的能动性。按照新的设计方案，汽车厂的车间将不仅是生产车间，同时也是设计、试制、科学研究车间；车间的每一个工人，都有可能向一人多技、体脑并用的全面发展方向发展。
    汽车厂的工厂设计考虑到企业的发展方向，正在按照毛主席的指示，有计划地逐步地把工厂办成一个综合性的联合企业。根据国家和厂内生产的需要，已新建了钢铁冶炼厂、水泥厂、建筑材料厂，还正在修理车间的基础上筹建机床厂和电机厂。
    班产二百五十辆的群众运动还只开始了第一个回合，就已经取得了显著的成绩。运动的实践，进一步教育和提高了群众。在这次运动中，群众的政治思想和技术文化水平都有显著提高，发扬了集体主义和共产主义的精神，出现了革命精神焕发的“游击”作风，亦即忘我劳动作风。企业的领导水平和管理方法，也获得进一步的改进。因此这也是汽车厂的一次全面革命。
    两参一改三结合
    汽车厂在企业全面革命道路上向前进步的重要标志，是进一步贯彻执行了党的依靠全体职工办企业的方针，实行了两参一改三结合。
    两参（干部参加劳动，工人参加管理）一改（改革不合理的规章制度）三结合（领导干部、工人、技术人员三者结合）是企业中领导和群众相结合，政治和经济相结合，技术理论和生产实践相结合的最好形式，是全国各地企业中已经行之有效的成功经验。党中央指出：
  两参一改三结合应当成为我国社会主义企业的根本制度。汽车厂学习兄弟企业的经验，在这次运动中放手发动了群众，进一步作了一些大胆的试验，用新的事实证明了全面地贯彻执行这一制度，能够使企业很快出现崭新的面貌，促进生产力的大发展。
    两参一改三结合的基本精神是：在党的领导下实行领导干部、工人、技职人员的三结合，紧紧依靠工人阶级，团结教育技术人员，大搞群众运动，充分调动全体职工的积极性，轰轰烈烈办好企业。这同企业中存在的某些不合理的管理制度，是根本对立的。
    汽车厂在整风运动中，执行了中央的指示，干部定期参加了劳动，在几个试验田里开始了工人参加日常生产管理的试点。今年5月间，进一步学习了庆华工具厂的经验，全面贯彻了两参一改，取消了工段一级领导，建立了七百零二个生产管理小组；初步进行了不合理的规章制度的改革；并在干部中提出选择一项劳动作为“第二职业”。半年多来，实行两参一改的结果，厂内干部群众对两参一改的重要意义更加明确了，经过班产百辆和班产二百五十辆的群众运动，“参”和“改”的范围都扩大了，出现了干部普遍参加劳动生产和工人全面参加管理的新局面，发扬了三结合的新风尚。
    汽车厂的干部参加劳动，虽然还作得不够，必须继续加强，作到制度化和经常化，但实行的结果，却已经充分显示出了干部参加劳动的重要意义。
    干部参加劳动，就是要求干部放下架子，打掉三风五气，以普通劳动者的姿态，到群众中去，到劳动中去，锻炼自己，改造自己。实行这一条，对干部自身说，是社会主义思想革命的具体表现，对工人群众说，则是最实际最生动的共产主义教育。用行动的教育比用语言的教育有更大的说服力。干部以平等姿态与工人并肩劳动，干部和工人在社会主义共同事业中互助合作的同志关系和战友关系，就具体显示出来了；干部和群众之间存在的某些隔阂，部分工人认为干部是“官”、工人受“管”的不正确看法，就很快地改变了；工人群众的劳动光荣感，主人翁的责任感，生产的积极性，参加管理的积极性，就显著地增强了；正因如此，生产能搞得好，工人参加管理也能管得好。
    在汽车厂，有的干部曾经怀疑干部参加劳动会削弱集中领导的作用。那时他们不了解社会主义企业管理的基本原则是群众路线，领导作用是加强还是削弱取决于领导者走不走群众路线；更没有懂得干部参加劳动就是一种最好的群众路线的领导方法。事实证明了，只要干部做到了定期地经常地参加劳动，而且在参加劳动中能严格地老老实实地遵守劳动纪律，听从生产指挥，学习生产技能，和工人群众打成一片，通过劳动进一步熟悉生产情况，了解生产中的关键问题，掌握群众思想动态，知道群众在干什么，想什么，有什么困难，有什么主张，并使自身真正成为三结合的参加者领导者，这样，就能够真正帮助下级和群众解决问题，就能够真正领导起群众。这才是深入的有效的领导。干部参加劳动对于提高群众共产主义觉悟，对于开展群众运动，对于办好企业，都是一个关键性的问题；而认真实行干部参加劳动，则是贯彻两参一改三结合的决定性环节。
    汽车厂工人参加管理，在初期，只限于管理日常生产事务。这次大搞群众运动，工人进一步参加设计，参预技术管理，彻底打破了所谓“工人不能参加技术领导”的错误论调。像在其他有些方面一样，在企业中的设计工作方面，也没有摆脱资产阶级思想的影响，这个工作领域，实际上是资产阶级技术思想藏身的一个顽固的堡垒。工人在企业的生产、经济、技术各方面全面地参加了管理，这就标志着在管理制度上进一步体现了社会主义企业的特色。工人参加设计、参加技术管理，这是一件富有生命力的新事物。社会主义企业在飞跃发展，工作的任何一个方面，都不是单独个人的或者少数人的学识才智所能适应的；技术设计工作同广大工人群众的经验智慧相结合，乃是必然的趋势。
    “参”进一步，“改”也必须进一步。为了使技术管理的制度能适应当前新的形势，最便利于发挥群众的积极性和创造性，就必须加以彻底改革。在汽车厂，关于技术管理制度的全面改革问题，还要进一步研究，但是经过这次运动，以下两个问题已可以明确了：
    一、技术前方和后方、生产和技术的矛盾与统一问题。长期以来，汽车厂存在着后方（专业技术部门）制定技术文件，前方（生产者）只能按葫芦画瓢的状况，因之前方生产实践中所创造的新事物不能反映和充实到技术资料中去，后方的少数人员担负着大量而复杂的任务，也感到力量薄弱，若干技术问题长期解决不了，待研究的课题很多，层次很多，推不动。这种情况在运动中有了改变。现在汽车厂已决定了以下几项措施：
    1．生产车间的工人和技术人员有一定的权力改进汽车、工具和设备的结构。为了使工人参加设计在制度上固定下来，在工人民主管理小组中增设一名或几名设计试制员。
    2．生产人员搞点工艺设计和工具设计工作，也搞点工具制造；工艺人员也搞点产品设计工作。改变设计、工艺与生产人员之间互不信任的工作关系。人是万能的，分工不应太细。
    3．新产品试制和生产准备工作，一定要发动群众大家动手，建立使专门机构和广大群众相结合的一套制度。
    工人参加设计，前后方关系的结合，对科学技术部门和工程技术人员来说，就给了他们改造思想、改进工作更有利的条件；而这也就是说，对他们的要求更高了，责任更加重了。只要他们在自己的工作中能够同工人群众密切结合起来，就一定能够发挥更大的作用。
    二、改变生产调度中的机械平衡方法问题。过去的生产调度有着明显的机械控制的特  征。例如：在零件、部件交接制度上，必须按既定计划执行，不许多、不许少，不许晚、不许早。结果，在千变万化、错综复杂的生产情况下，往往一处出了事，牵连全局，甚至造成流水线阻塞，在制品积压，而束缚了群众的积极性。新产品试制和班产二百五十辆运动对这些制度进行了冲击，并创造出有领导的群众性生产调度和生产管理做法。这种群众性的做法解决问题最快，消灭了扯皮现象，发扬了共产主义协作精神。群众性调度的特点是：生产过程中的生产关系由生产者的直接联系连结起来；充分体现出相互负责，而不只是对上负责；生产中的困难为大家所了解，相互体谅和相互帮助。这就出现了很多新的气象。
    两参，一改，三结合，是相辅而行，互为表里，互相促进的。三结合就是在实行两参一改的条件下，随着群众运动更广泛深入的发展而发展起来的。
    在汽车厂的历次运动中，特别是技术革命运动中，许多重大的技术和生产关键都是由群众提出而用三结合的办法解决的。实践证明，领导干部、工人和技职人员的三股绳拧成一股劲，在克服任何困难时，都是势如破竹，所向披靡的。
    实行了三结合，企业行政领导者和技术领导者真正做到了在运动中领导运动，在生产中领导生产，从而更好地发挥了领导的作用。例如锻工车间热处理工部，为了向班产二百五十辆跃进，组成了一个三结合的“苦干突击队”，工部主任参加，并且住到车间，同群众一道生产，一道研究解决技术问题，苦战十几昼夜，终于突破了重重的技术难关，放出了班产三百辆的“卫星”。
    在突破生产难关，解决技术难题的战斗中常常是由领导干部、工人和技职人员在一起开三结合会，共同研究，展开争论，统一思想，找出办法，动手就干。广大职工的积极性创造性被调动起来，大家取长补短，互相帮助，进行双边或多边的合作，形成集体的诸葛亮，结果就创造出奇迹来。例如，铸工车间辗砂机的自动化问题，过去技术人员单枪匹马研究了两年多都失败了，这次技术员彭映培在党总支、车间主任的亲自指导和工人的帮助下，很快就试验成功，取得了生产能力由年产三万辆跃进到年产二十四万辆的重大成绩。又例如，过去设计师们想要把笨重的铸造后桥壳改为轻便的焊接后桥壳，但由于生产经验不够，没有找到理想的制造方法，所以一直没能实现；在这次运动中，锻工车间职工共同努力，苦战了十几天，就把焊接的后桥壳试制成功。
    从这里看出，三结合使过去存在的技术与生产、理论与实践脱节的状态，改变为密切结合的状态，在技术革命中起了重大的作用。回顾工人参加设计、大闹技术革命的全部过程，更看出这件事有深刻的意义。广大技术人员从运动中受到了深刻的教育，得到了进一步的思想改造，在不同程度上提高了政治思想觉悟，加强了同生产工人的联系，重视和吸取了群众的生产实践经验，从而有效地弥补和克服了许多设计人员的理论和实际不能密切结合的局限性。工人在长期生产劳动实践中积累的大量宝贵经验，由于有了技术人员的帮助而得到总结和提高，就立刻大放奇光异彩，出现了大批优秀的设计成果，形成了设计工作生气勃勃的发展局面。
    在理论与实际密切结合的原则指导下，在群众创造性劳动的实践经验基础上，不仅技术的应用有了很大的进步，技术理论也必将不断得到提高，这种苗头已经出现了。例如锻工车间的平锻工人提出把经过六道型槽锻打一个气门减为四道，工艺师开始认为没有理论根据，但工人在党支部的支持下试验成功了，使工艺师很感惊奇，经过与工人共同研究后，发现原来所根据的理论并不完整；现在这位工程师正准备帮助工人写一篇论文，来补充旧的原理。
    在汽车厂，由于实行了两参一改三结合，由于大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，获得了第一批累累的果实。这就使得广大职工振奋鼓舞，扩大了政治视野，看到广阔的用武之地，同时增强了掌握尖端技术和科学理论的志愿和信心，从而激起了人们对于文化革命的迫切要求。创造新型汽车机油泵的工人毛俊杰同志说：“我们工人科学理论知识不多，过去只是想了就做，不行再做，做成了以后，再去请工程师帮助找个原理，这就免不了要走弯路；今后一定要提高技术理论水平，才能更好地参加设计。”这几句朴素的话表明，仅仅有技术人员在具体问题上的帮助，是已经不能满足工人群众了。为了适应广大群众文化革命的迫切要求，汽车厂正在筹建汽车工业大学（发动机车间就成立发动机系，热处理车间就成立热处理系……），这个大学也是贯彻三结合的精神。大学的教授根据“能者为师”的原则来挑选，可以由工程师、技术员担任，也可以由职员、工人和土专家担任，实现互教互学，共同提高；并且要在适当的时期内逐步实行六小时生产、四小时学习的半工半读、厂校合一的制度，以便在一个不很长的时间内，使全厂职工都成为又有生产技能又有高度文化水平的“多面手”，加速消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的界限。
    从汽车厂贯彻两参一改三结合的实践中看到，实行了这个企业管理的根本大法，企业中的政治思想情况和生产情况，都会迅速发生显著的变化：风格高尚，敢想敢干；掌握规律，“人”主“物”从；“劳”“技”结合，“体”“脑”并用；亦“工”亦“干”，一人多能；“虚”“实”并举，生产跃进；力争上游，奔向大同——这些就是显示了的趋势。群众运动的发展必然带来技术革命和文化革命的新高涨，带来更进一步的生产大跃进，并且为人的全面发展开辟着宽阔的道路，为建成社会主义和为将来逐步向共产主义过渡创造着越来越多的条件。
    大搞群众运动的几点经验
    毛主席指示：工业方面要搞大规模的群众运动。经验证明了这个指示的正确性和重大意义。过去有人说：“别的方面可以搞群众运动，技术工作不能搞群众运动”。汽车厂的事实使这种说法也没有站脚的余地了。事实证明，企业任何一项重大的工作都可以而且必须大搞群众运动。只要大搞群众运动，只要将一切工作建筑在群众共产主义自觉的基础上，就会不断出现奇迹。
    如何在企业中贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动，从汽车厂的工作中得到以下几点体会：
    一、大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论。“四大”是在整风运动中创造出来的最广泛最充分的社会主义民主形式。在企业的革命跃进中，必须采用“四大”的方法，大破大立；这是政治挂帅、群众路线发挥神威的大场面。汽车厂大搞群众运动的主要障碍是右倾保守思想。其具体表现是信物不信人，信书（本）不信实（际），信洋不信土，信专（家）不信群（众）。有右倾保守思想的人是根本不相信群众的，他们把群众运动说成是“不正规”，贬之为“农村作风”、“游击习气”。这是资产阶级思想的反映。同这种思想作斗争，必须高举群众路线的旗帜，充分发挥群众运动的威力。汽车厂职工在整风运动以来，历次群众运动中一共提出了七十余万条意见。这不但造成了大规模群众运动的声势，对克服保守，推动进步，兴无灭资，解决政治思想问题，起着决定性的作用；而且在大闹技术革命、解决技术问题中，也起了重大的作用。拿这次运动中的例子说，锻工车间模锻工部的几个领导干部认为班产百辆份时，群众力量消耗已经够劲了，开始不敢向群众提出班产二百五十辆的目标，只是少数人算账，伸手要设备。车间党总支纠正了他们的做法，要他们放手发动群众，在动员后的两天之内，工人一面贴大字报，一面进行试验，提出了并模锻打、一锤多件、周期轧制等许多重大革命性的建议，解决了班产三百辆的主要关键。底盘车间后桥工部，在技术问题上，不管一个措施，一个草图，一项改革，都在民主管理小组内或小组外讨论，鸣放辩论之风大盛。为了改进刹车机构，他们和设计师们展开了一场大辩论，曾经组织专门小组，到设计处“登门辩论”，有时请设计师到工部辩论，最后综合双方意见，确定了既便利于司机又能节省设备的气油混合刹车。经验告诉我们，运用“四大”，可以充分地从思想上把群众发动起来，能够彻底揭露问题，辨明是非，统一认识；能够造成声势，振奋人心，鼓足干劲；而群众在思想跃进的基础上，就会更好地发挥集体智慧，提出许多重大创议，迅速有效地解决各种问题。总之，运用“四大”是大搞群众运动的基本方法；采用或不采用“四大”的方法，对思想斗争和技术革命来说，在某种意义上和不少问题上，也是走彻底革命道路或者是走改良道路的斗争。
    二、不断革命、不断跃进。目前是形势逼人，变化万千；经过历次运动的锻炼，群众思想不断解放，觉悟不断提高，他们经常不满足于已有的成绩，不断提出新的希望和要求。所以，不断革命和不断跃进的思想，实际上来自群众。领导的作用，就是要善于集中群众的意志，及时讲明形势，指出方向，不断提出新的任务。群众懂得了形势，认清了方向，明确了任务，就会不断给自己提出难题，不断提出新的奋斗目标，来压迫自己，又鼓舞自己，一往无前地克服困难，实现一个又一个的跃进目标。现在看来，思想越解放、群众越发动，干劲就越足、跃进就越快，这已经成了规律。
    三、采取“五边”办法，处理合理化建议。“五边”就是边设计、边试制、边试验、边改进、边制定实现措施。汽车厂采取这个办法，彻底打垮了过去审查和处理群众建议的无数清规戒律，改变了“群众建议很多，领导处理迟缓”的脱离群众的现象，树立了“大家建议，三结合审查，领导决定，群众实现”的群众路线的作法。这种作法既可以增强群众参加设计、大闹技术革命的信心，巩固和不断提高他们的热情，也可以使建议和措施很快收到实效。
    四、抓先进带落后。汽车厂学习和推广了国内其它单位经常采用的一些方法：节日献礼，开庙会、表演会、展览会，组织参观，组织厂内外的互相支援，等等。还试行了一种新的方法，就是召开不马上闭幕的职工代表大会。用这种方法随时表扬先进，提高落后，它的好处是经常公开树立对立面，造成声势，促进群众在运动中的自我教育和自我改造，使每个单位和每个人不断给自己提出新的任务，经常保持饱满的情绪，比先进、学先进、赶先进。实际上这也是一种社会主义竞赛——没有竞赛条件的、力争上游的竞赛。
    五、苦战和休整相结合，劳和逸相结合。汽车厂从历次群众运动中体会到，这个问题对于运动的不断健康发展，有极重要的意义。一方面，有苦战有休整，劳逸相间，是运动本身的波浪式发展的规律所要求的，是一个领导艺术问题。大规模发动起群众，必然有一场紧张的突击；突击一定时间以后，进行适时的休整，可以自上而下、自下而上地总结前一阶段运动的经验，巩固已得的成果，提高群众，积蓄力量，准备下一个跃进；经过不断运动，不断总结，起伏前进，使一浪高过一浪。因此，休整必须有休有整，不是运动的中断，不等于完全休息。另方面，劳逸结合又是在群众热情高涨的情况下不可忽视的重要领导原则，是关乎领导者关心群众生活、爱护群众积极性的革命责任问题。运动中除了要有突击有经常，有跃进有巩固，同时做到领导和群众同甘苦、共欢乐以外，还必须在突击跃进的时候，也保证群众得到必要的休息和睡眠，注意生产劳动中的安全问题。领导者必须懂得，在群众觉悟越提高，干劲越足，热情越高涨，劳动越紧张的情况下，就越要关心群众的生活。汽车厂提出在今后的运动中，要保证群众有一定的休息和学习时间，并将逐步实行四班制，这是正确的作法。
    六、加强党的领导。汽车厂的群众运动，是在工厂党委一元化领导下开展起来的。全厂所以能够实现革命性的大跃进，是由于贯彻执行了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和依靠全体职工办企业的正确方针的结果。运动又一次和进一步地证明了：党在企业中能够领导一切，必须领导一切，技术领域也不例外（不言而喻，这种领导并不等于党委直接包办一切）。两参一改三结合越是深入贯彻，群众运动越是发展，党的威信就越高，群众就越要求党来领导，党对各方面的领导也就越应该加强。如果以为群众发动了，运动搞得不错了，党的领导可以放松了，那就必然会犯严重的错误。
  总的来说，汽车厂大搞群众运动以来，工厂面貌开始了革命性的变化。汽车厂要完成企业的全面革命，今后还需作更大的努力。必须继续发扬共产主义思想，用不断革命的精神，解放思想，改进作风，大搞群众运动，肃清资产阶级思想，为建设新型的社会主义企业、更大发展生产力而奋斗。
