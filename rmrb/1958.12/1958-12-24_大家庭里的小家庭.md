    The bright winter sun shone into the small courtyard, climbing onto the frost-covered window panes. The door was ajar, but there was no sound of adults talking, nor the laughter of children playing; only a few leafless, withered trees standing by the mud wall rustled in the breeze. It turned out that the masters of the house had all left.
    The first to leave was the father, Li Zhenying. This sturdy man in his thirties was a cook in a public canteen of the commune. To ensure the members could eat warm and full before heading to the fields, he often got up early and worked late alone to prepare breakfast. Next, the mother and grandfather also left. The mother, without household worries, participated in labor like the men, unburdened. She fed pigs at the pig farm of the public canteen. The elderly grandfather, though over seventy, was still quite fit. He did carpentry work and never missed a day. In the early morning, he would take his ever-present dry tobacco pipe and head to work. Finally, the four little darlings left home. The ten-year-old elder sister and the eight-year-old elder brother were both in elementary school. On their way to early classes, they would drop off the two younger sisters at the nursery. Thus, the home became so quiet.
    However, it became lively again in the evening. The whole family returned and gathered together happily. The light illuminated the entire room brightly, and the red glow of the stove radiated warmth. The grandfather smoked his pipe, teasing his two granddaughters. The children giggled, their faces as round and red as apples, their eyes narrowed into slits when they smiled! The children grew so strong thanks to the patient care of the nannies at the nursery. The youngest sister, who could barely walk, was always held and cuddled, so her mother didn't have to worry about her falling. The older three-year-old girl played so happily with her friends, and the nannies taught them songs and told them stories! The commune's specially established children's canteen was also well-run, serving meat, eggs, and soy milk regularly. With such meticulous care, how could the children not grow fat? At home, the mother alone couldn't manage it all! Looking at his granddaughters' chubby faces, the grandfather couldn't help but smile and praise the nursery for being so well-run. So, the topic turned to the nursery. Perhaps the mother felt this the most deeply. Since her mother-in-law died, she had lost a helper and had been trapped in household chores. She had to take care of the children, cook meals, wash clothes, and mend them; she was busy all day long, let alone participate in labor production. Now, with the establishment of the People's Commune, the children went to the nursery, and the adults ate in the public canteen. She no longer had to worry about household matters. How could she not be happy? Hearing her grandfather say the nursery was well-run, she also praised it repeatedly.
    After a while, Li Zhenying would turn on his newly bought crystal radio to listen. Although he was tired from a day's work, he was still eager to learn. Usually, in the canteen, whenever he had time, he would study Hanyu Pinyin with other cooks. In the evenings, he also loved to turn on the crystal radio to listen to the news and reports, writing down the characters he had learned during the day as he listened. At such times, his wife would tease him: "Look at you, so proactive, wanting to become a model student! I can't do it; I missed classes the other day when the child wasn't feeling well." Then Li Zhenying would answer seriously, "That doesn't matter, I'll teach you." While saying this, he would also instruct the two older children to review their homework.
    Gradually, it quieted down, with only the rustling sound of Li Zhenying writing, the "bada bada" sound of the grandfather smoking his pipe, the low chanting of the elementary school students, and the peaceful snores of the little darlings who were already asleep... These sounds intertwined into a sweet and happy melody, a melody that deeply touched the mother's heart. She would unconsciously stop sewing and think, "These are the good days that the Communist Party has brought us!" But the work in her hands couldn't be delayed; it was the cotton shoes she was making for her grandfather, and the old man and the children couldn't be allowed to get cold. So, she would concentrate on sewing again. In the distance, the bugle sounded, telling the hardworking members that it was time to rest. The lights in Li Zhenying's home also dimmed, with only the bright stars and moon overlooking the earth.
    Our socialist motherland is a happy big family, and the more than twenty-six thousand People's Communes are the medium-sized families within this big family. These new types of medium-sized families are composed of more than one hundred and twenty million happy small families. Li Zhenying's family is an extremely ordinary one, and there are countless such harmonious and united families in the vast countryside of our motherland! I share their joy, I bless them, and I cannot help but think of that lying Mr. Dulles, who, wearing his hypocritical mask of compassion, attacked us for destroying the family. Let the example of Li Zhenying's warm family give him a hard slap in the face! (Attached image)

    大家庭里的小家庭
    苏方
    冬天的明丽的太阳，照进了小小的院落，爬上了蒙着白霜的玻璃窗。屋门虚掩着，却听不见大人的谈话声，也听不见孩子的嘻闹声，只有兀立在土墙边的几株落了叶的枯树，在微风中飕飕地响。原来主人们都离开家了。
    最早离开家的是父亲李振英。这个三十多岁的精壮结实的汉子，是公社一个公共食堂里的炊事员。为了让社员们能够吃得又暖又饱的去上地，他常常独个儿起早摸黑地去做早饭。接着母亲和爷爷也走了。母亲没有家事烦心，像男人们一样，无挂无碍地参加了劳动，在公共食堂的养猪场里喂猪。年老的爷爷，别看他已经七十多岁了，身体却挺硬朗。他干木匠活，从来没有误过一天工。清早，他就带上自己那从不离身的旱烟管上工去了。最后离开家的，是那四个小宝贝。十岁的姐姐、八岁的哥哥，都在小学里念书。在上早学的时候，他们就顺路把两个小妹妹送到托儿所。于是，这个家就变得这样安静了。
    不过，一到晚上，可就热闹了。一家人都回来了，乐融融地团聚在一起。灯光把整个屋子照得明亮亮的，红红的炉火透着暖意。爷爷一面吸着旱烟，一面逗弄着两个小孙女儿。孩子咯咯地笑着，像苹果一样的小脸蛋上全是肉，一笑眼睛就眯成一条缝了！孩子们长得这么壮，那得感谢托儿所的阿姨大娘们的耐心的照顾。还不大会走的小妹妹，总有人搂着抱着，不用妈妈耽心会跌交；大一点儿的三姑娘，和小朋友们玩得多开心呀，阿姨们还要教他们唱歌，为他们讲故事哩！公社特地为孩子们成立的幼儿食堂也办得好，常吃肉，吃鸡蛋，喝豆浆。孩子们被照顾得这么周到，能不长胖吗？在家里，光靠母亲一双手，那儿管得过来呢！看着小孙女儿们的小胖脸，爷爷不由得乐起来，不由得称赞起托儿所办得好来。于是，话题就围绕着托儿所扯开了。对于这，感触最深的恐怕要算母亲了。自从婆婆死了以后，家里少了个帮手，她便陷在家务事里了。又要带孩子，又要做饭，又要浆衣洗裳，又要缝缝补补，成天忙这些都忙不过来，更别说参加劳动生产了。现在，人民公社成立了，小孩上了托儿所，大人们在公共食堂吃饭，她再不用为家事牵心挂肠了，她怎能不高兴呢。听到，爷爷说托儿所办得好，她便也连声称赞起来。
    谈论一阵，李振英便会打开新买的矿石收音机听起来。虽然一天工作很累，但是他仍旧热心学习。平时在食堂里，一有空，他就和别的几个炊事员一块儿学汉语拼音；晚上回到家里，他也爱打开矿石收音机听听新闻，听听什么人的报告，一面听，一面还要写白天学会的字。每当这时候，妻子就爱跟他开开玩笑：“瞧你，真积极，要想当学习模范呀！我可不成，前几天孩子不舒服，拉下了课哩。”于是李振英就会一本正经地回答：“那不要紧，我教你好了。”一面说一面又关照两个大孩子复习功课。
    慢慢地静下来了，只听见李振英写字的沙沙声，只听见爷爷抽旱烟的吧达吧达声，只听见小学生们低低的诵读声，只听见早已入睡了的小宝贝们安恬的鼾声……这些声音交织成一支甜美幸福的曲子，这曲子是那么深切地触动着母亲的心。她会不自觉地停下针来想：“这是共产党带给咱们的好日子！”但是，手里的活可不能耽误呀，那是给爷爷做的棉鞋呢，老人和小孩可不能让他们冻着。于是她又会专心地缝起来。远处，号声响了，这是告诉勤劳的社员们，应该休息了。李振英家里的灯光也暗了下来，只有满天朗朗的星月，俯视着大地。
    我们的社会主义祖国是个幸福的大家庭，二万六千多个人民公社是这个大家庭的中型家庭，这种新型的中型家庭，又是由一亿二千多万户幸福的小家庭组成的。李振英的家是极其普通的一家，像这样和睦团结的家庭，在祖国广大的农村，不知有多少多少个！我分享着他们的喜悦，我为他们祝福，而我也不禁想起了那个善于撒谎的杜勒斯先生，他曾经戴着那副悲天悯人的假面具攻击我们破坏了家庭，那就让李振英的这个温暖的家庭的事例，狠狠地给他一记耳光吧！（附图片）
