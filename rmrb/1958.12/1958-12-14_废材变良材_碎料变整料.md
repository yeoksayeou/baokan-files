The People's Daily reports that, in order to ensure the timely supply of large quantities of timber for national construction, forestry departments in various regions are not only actively logging timber but also vigorously developing the production of fiberboard.

Currently, nearly ten provinces (regions) including Hunan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Guangdong, and Heilongjiang have established experimental factories and are summarizing experiences through pilot projects in preparation for full-scale promotion.

Small-scale as the mainstay, combined with large and medium-sized, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting with indigenous methods then moving to foreign, this is the guiding principle for actively developing fiberboard production. Many places have implemented this principle. Under the leadership of the Party, all the employees of the Shanghai Yangzi Timber Factory, daring to think and daring to act, used entirely indigenous equipment to trial-produce fiberboard that fully met the standards. Hunan Provincial Timber Company even trial-produced three types of fiberboard without using a single machine. The Shanghai Timber Factory No. 1 and the Fiberboard Experimental Factory of the Forestry Industry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Forestry, both combining indigenous and foreign methods, have officially gone into production, and the fiberboard produced meets the quality standards, setting a good example for small, indigenous groups to vigorously develop fiberboard production.

The Ministry of Forestry pointed out that the fiberboard industry is a new industry in our country. Vigorously developing fiberboard production is one of the central tasks of forestry work next year and is the main way to comprehensively utilize wood and improve the utilization rate of wood. The Ministry of Forestry requires forestry departments at all levels to do this work well. In addition to requiring provinces to rely on their own efforts to solve the problems of equipment and technical strength, the Ministry of Forestry has also made appropriate arrangements.

The People's Daily reports that the Fiberboard Experimental Factory of the Forestry Industry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Forestry, which began operating on December 1, has changed the hot alkali treatment of raw materials to cold alkali treatment, which can save both coal and caustic soda and improve product quality.

This factory was built using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. After it started operating, workers Qian Yinglin and Wang Peiyuan quickly discovered that using steaming to process raw materials not only wasted electricity and coal and took a long time, but also made the processed raw materials turn black, affecting the quality of the product. They thought: hot treatment consumes 30 kilograms of coal per hour, and at least 30 hours are required for each pot. What a huge number this is! With the support of the Party, they finally successfully tested the method of treating raw materials with cold alkali. This cold treatment has many advantages over hot pot steaming. It occupies less factory space; only a few pools are enough. The pulp produced is uniform, and the fiber recovery rate is high. Hot treatment only recovers 60% to 70% of the raw materials, while cold treatment can increase this to 80% to 90%. The texture of the raw materials is also better, and it retains a large amount of lignin. The pressed fiberboard is beautiful and generous and can improve the strength of the fiberboard. Cold treatment saves coal and caustic soda and greatly shortens the processing time. Originally, it took 10 to 15 kilograms of alkali and 30 hours to steam 100 kilograms of raw materials in a heating pot. With cold alkali treatment, only 5 to 6 kilograms of alkali are needed, and it only takes 3 to 4 hours to process 100 kilograms of raw materials. Cold treatment fully embodies the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical." This reform has put wings on the vigorous development of the fiberboard industry across the country.

Currently, the radial bending strength of the hard artificial fiberboard produced by this factory has reached the international level. It can be used to build tall buildings and is a good material for assembling trains and ships. It has no knots, no wood grain, uniform hardness, and is not easily expanded, contracted, warped, or cracked. (Attached picture)

    废材变良材  碎料变整料
    本报讯  各地林业部门为保证及时供应国家建设大量用材，除积极采伐木材外，正大力发展纤维板的生产。
    目前，已有湖南、陕西、湖北、广东、黑龙江等近十个省（区）办起了试验厂，正在通过试办总结经验，准备全面推广。
    小型为主，大中小结合，土洋结合，先土后洋，这是积极发展纤维板生产的方针。很多地方贯彻了这个方针。上海扬子木材厂的全体职工在党的领导下，敢想敢干，采用全部土设备试制成了完全合乎标准的纤维板。湖南省木材公司不用一台机器也试制成了三种纤维板。土洋结合的上海木材一厂，北京林业科学研究院森工研究所纤维板试验厂，都已正式投入生产，生产出的纤维板都合乎质量标准，为小土群大搞纤维板生产树立了良好榜样。
    林业部指出，纤维板工业是我国一项新兴工业，大搞纤维板生产是明年林业工作的中心工作之一，是综合利用木材、提高木材利用率的主要途径。林业部要求各级林业部门一定把这项工作作好。对设备和技术力量问题，除要求各省自力更生外，林业部也作了适当的安排。
    本报讯  12月1日开始运转的中国林业科学院森工研究所纤维板试验工厂，将热碱处理原料改为冷碱处理，既能节约煤和烧碱，又能提高产品质量。
    这个厂是用土洋结合的办法建立起来的。开始运转以后，工人钱瑛琳、王培元很快就发现处理原料用蒸煮的办法，不仅浪费电、煤，蒸煮的时间长，而且处理后的原料颜色发黑，影响产品的质量。他们想：热处理一个小时要消耗三十公斤煤，一锅至少得煮三十个小时，这是个多么庞大的数字呀！在党的支持下，他们终于试验成功了用冷碱处理原料的方法。这种冷处理，较热锅蒸煮有许多好处。占厂房的面积小。只用几个水池子就够了；泡制出来的浆料均匀，纤维回收率高，热处理仅收回原料60％—70％；用冷法处理原料可提高到80％—90％；原料的质地也好，而且保有大量的木质素，压制出来的纤维板美观、大方，而且可以提高纤维板的强度。采用冷处理省煤和烧碱，而且大大缩短了处理时间。原来用加热锅蒸煮一百公斤原料，需要十至十五公斤碱，花费三十个小时；用冷碱处理一百公斤原料，只要五至六公斤碱，三至四个小时就够了。冷处理完全符合多快好省的精神。这一改革，为在全国大力发展纤维板工业，插上了翅膀。
    目前，这个厂生产出的硬质人造纤维板的径曲强度，已达到国际水平。它可以盖高大的楼房，而且是装配火车、轮船的好材料，它没有节疤、没有木纹，硬度均匀，并且不容易膨胀、收缩、翘曲和开裂。（附图片）
