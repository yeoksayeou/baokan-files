    A Group of Little Warriors in the Soil
    Gao Shiqi

    Soil is a vast battlefield where a fierce struggle for life rages day and night. Besides various animals and plants, a massive army of microorganisms participates in the battle. Their numbers are astonishingly large. According to the latest estimates, there can be as many as 100 million to 1 billion of them in every gram of soil, with the bacteria force being the most powerful and active.

    Generally speaking, in the competition for life, the bacteria force wins due to its large numbers, rapid reproduction, and strong fermentation capabilities. In nature, wherever there is organic matter and moisture, there are bacteria.

    Soil is the bacteria's base, and every moist soil particle is their gathering place. Their reproduction is very fast. Once they encounter something to eat, they divide into one, then two, then four, then eight... continuously splitting, approximately every twenty minutes. However, the speed of their reproduction depends on the environmental conditions.

    First, it depends on the soil's acidity and alkalinity. Generally, bacteria prefer to live in slightly alkaline soil. In this type of soil, they can reproduce faster. If the soil becomes acidic, their activity weakens.

    Second, it depends on the season, which is related to temperature. Some bacteria prefer warmth; some prefer cold; but most bacteria prefer to reproduce in normal climates, so their life activities are most active in spring and autumn.

    Third, it depends on humidity. In dry soil, bacterial activity is greatly restricted. Humidity around 50-70% is most conducive to bacterial growth and reproduction.

    Fourth, it depends on the oxygen supply. Some bacteria need sufficient oxygen to survive; these are called aerobic bacteria. Some bacteria do not need oxygen; in fact, they cannot survive in an oxygenated environment.

    When the bacteria force participates in the soil battle, what impact does it have on crops?

    Many types of organic matter or organic fertilizers cannot be directly absorbed by plants. They must be decomposed by bacteria into a state that plants can absorb. For example, nitrates are produced in this way.

    The activity of some bacteria can fix nitrogen from the air, turning it into nitrogen fertilizer needed by plants; some bacteria can dissolve inorganic salts in the soil that are not easily soluble, helping plants obtain certain elements from inorganic nutrients, such as phosphorus.

    Furthermore, some bacteria, as a result of their metabolism, can turn organic matter into humus, producing an organic acid that can cement soil particles together, forming stable aggregates and improving soil fertility.

    During their development and growth, plants can sometimes absorb antibiotics and vitamins, which are organic substances secreted by other microorganisms such as fungi and actinomycetes.

    However, the operations of some microorganisms have a destructive effect on plant survival. Some of these microorganisms eat excessively, reducing nitrates and sulfates in the soil, making them unusable by plants; some reduce the oxygen concentration in the root system, creating an unfavorable environment for plant growth; some even produce toxins that harm plant life; and some simply occupy plants, causing diseases in crops.

    How can we direct the life activities of soil microorganisms in a direction that is beneficial to agricultural production increase? This is a problem currently being studied. Part of this problem has already been solved by the application of bacterial fertilizers.

    There are many types of bacterial fertilizers, such as rhizobia and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which are the most commonly used. They can all absorb nitrogen from the air, fix it, and turn it into nutrients for plants. Bacterial fertilizers can be cultivated artificially, which is something that happened after science participated in the soil battle.

    Let those beneficial strains—a group of little warriors in the soil—exert their maximum effect and serve agricultural production!

    土壤里的一群小战士
    高士其
    土壤是个大战场，日日夜夜都在进行着非常激烈的生命斗争。参加作战的，除了形形色色的动物和植物外，还有庞大的微生物大军。它们的数量大得惊人，根据最新的估计，在每一克重的土壤里，它们的数量可以达到一亿到十亿之多，其中以细菌部队的力量最为雄厚和活跃。
    一般说来，在生命活动的竞赛中，细菌部队是以数量多、繁殖快和醱酵能力强获得优胜的。在自然界里，哪里有有机物和水分，那里就有细菌的存在。
    土壤是细菌的根据地，每一颗湿润的土粒，都是它们的集中场所。它们的繁殖非常快，一遇到可吃的东西，就一而二，二而四，四而八……一直分裂下去，大约每隔二十分钟就分裂一次。但是，它们繁殖的快慢，还要看环境的条件来决定。
    第一，要看土壤的酸碱度。一般细菌都是喜欢在略带碱性的土壤里居住。在这种土壤里，它们能繁殖得更快。如果土壤变成酸性，它们的活动就减弱了。
    第二，要看季节，这是和温度有关的。有些细菌喜欢温热；有些细菌喜欢寒冷；但大部分的细菌都是喜欢在正常的气候里繁殖，所以它们的生命活动，以春秋二季最为活跃。
    第三，要看湿度。在干燥的土壤里，细菌活动大受限制，湿度在50—70％左右，最利于细菌的生长繁殖。
    第四，要看氧气的供应情况。有些细菌需要足够的氧气才能生活，这类细菌叫做好气菌，有些细菌不需要氧气，在有氧气的环境里，反而不能生存。
    当细菌部队参加土壤的战斗的时候，会给农作物带来什么影响呢？
    有许多种有机质或有机肥料，植物不能直接吸收，这就必须经过细菌的作用，把它们分解，使它们变成植物可以吸收的状态。例如硝酸盐就是这样产生出来的。
    有些细菌的活动，可以把空气中的氮固定起来，成为植物所需要的氮素肥料；有些细菌可以把土壤中不易溶解的无机盐类都溶解了，帮助植物获得无机养料中的某种元素，例如磷等。
    还有些细菌，由于新陈代谢的结果，能把有机质变为腐植质，产生了一种有机酸，可以把土壤的粒子胶结起来，变成稳固的团粒，提高土壤的肥力。
    植物在它们发育生长的过程中，有的时候还能吸收抗生素和维生素，这些有机物质，是由其他微生物如真菌和放线菌等所分泌出来的。
    但是，也有些微生物的作战，对于植物的生存，起了破坏的作用。这些微生物，有的因为吃得过火，把土壤中的硝酸盐和硫酸盐都还原了，使植物不能利用；有的减低了根系的氧的浓度，造成了对于植物生长不利的环境；有的甚至产生了危害植物生命的毒素；更有的简直盘据在植物上面使农作物发生了病害。
    怎样使土壤微生物的生命活动朝着有利于农业增产的方向发展？是目前正在研究的问题。这个问题，有一部分已经由细菌肥料的施用而解决了。
    细菌肥料种类很多，如根瘤菌和固氮菌等都是最常用的。它们都能吸收空气中的氮，把它固定起来，变成植物的养料。细菌肥料，可以用人工的方法来培养，这是科学参加土壤的战斗以后的事。
    让那些有益的菌种——土壤里的一群小战士，发挥它们最大的效用，为农业生产服务吧！
