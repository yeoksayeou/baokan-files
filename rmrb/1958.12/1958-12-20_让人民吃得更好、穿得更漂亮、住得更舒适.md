    To continuously raise the material living standards of the people on the basis of developing socialist production and increasing labor productivity is the law of development of the socialist economy. Therefore, the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan stipulates not only the vigorous development of production but also the further and substantial improvement of the material welfare of the Soviet people.
    
    Rapid Increase in National Income
    
    From 1913 to 1957, the Soviet Union's national income increased thirteenfold per capita. During the same period, the United States only doubled, while Britain and France only increased by 70%. During the Seven-Year Plan, due to the vigorous development of production, the Soviet Union's national income will increase significantly, by 62%-65% in 1965 compared to 1958. The Soviet Union's national income not only increases faster than that of capitalist countries, but it is also a genuine people's income. It is not used to enrich a handful of exploiters, as in capitalist countries, but to raise the living standards of the people and expand production. Therefore, during the seven years, the consumption of the people will increase by 60%-63%.
    
    Raising Wages and Farmers' Income
    
    The actual income of workers and collective farm members will increase by 40% during the seven years. This will be achieved by raising wages, increasing social production on farms, and increasing pensions and subsidies.
    
    The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that while generally raising wages, attention will be paid to raising low and medium wages to narrow the gap between low and medium wages and high wages. Low wages will nearly double within seven years.
    
    In order to adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in residents' income, the retail commodity turnover of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce will increase by 57%-62% in seven years. Within seven years, the sale of livestock products to residents will increase by 1.2 times, vegetable oil by 90%, and fruits and citrus fruits by 1.5 to 2 times. Sugar production per capita will reach 41 to 44 kilograms per year (only 26 kilograms in 1958). In terms of total sugar production, the Soviet Union's sugar production will increase to 10 million tons in 1965, which will account for one-fifth of the world's total sugar production, more than the total sugar production of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and India. At the same time, the quantity of important industrial products sold to residents, such as textiles, clothing, and footwear, will also increase significantly. By 1965, the average per capita output will be close to the level of the United States.
    
    In addition, the quantity of cultural, living, and economic goods sold to residents, especially those that reduce the labor of women in daily life: washing machines, electric floor polishers, vacuum cleaners, electric irons, and household refrigerators, will greatly increase. Compared with the previous seven years, washing machines and tableware will increase by 7.8 times, the number of household refrigerators sold to residents will increase by 4.6 times, sewing machines will increase by 1.1 times, televisions will increase by 3.6 times, radios will increase by 70%, motorcycles and mopeds will increase by 1.7 times, the number of standard houses sold to residents will increase by six times, cement will increase by 1.8 times, soft roofing will increase by 1.1 times, and window glass will increase by 60%. This means that seven years later, the Soviet people will eat better, dress more beautifully, and live more comfortably.
    
    The World's Shortest Workday
    
    In order to give the Soviet people more time to study, rest, and take care of their families, according to the resolution of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet Union began to implement a two-hour reduction in the workday on Saturdays and the day before holidays in 1956. By the end of last year, more than 20% of the enterprises in some factories in Moscow, the Donbass Voroshilovgrad coal mining area, the ferrous metallurgy sector, and the chemical industry sector, as well as hundreds of factories in the machinery manufacturing industry, had implemented a seven-hour workday. Some industries with more strenuous labor and that are detrimental to health are also gradually implementing a six-hour workday. The Seven-Year Plan has made further provisions in this regard, and it is planned to fully implement a five-day workweek system (working six to seven hours a day, with two days of holiday per week) by 1968. In this way, the shortest workday and the shortest workweek system in the world will be implemented in the Soviet Union.

### 让人民吃得更好、穿得更漂亮、住得更舒适

    让人民吃得更好、穿得更漂亮、住得更舒适
    在发展社会主义生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上不断提高人民的物质生活水平，是社会主义经济的发展规律。所以苏联的七年计划在规定大力发展生产的同时，也规定进一步大大提高苏联人民的物质福利。
    国民收入的迅速增加
    苏联国民收入从1913年到1957年间，按人口平均计算，增加了十三倍。同一时期，美国只增加了一倍，英国和法国只增加了70％。七年计划期间，由于生产的蓬勃发展，苏联的国民收入还要大大增加，1965年将比1958年增加62％—65％。苏联的国民收入不仅比资本主义国家增加快，而且它是真正的人民收入，它不像资本主义国家那样用来使一小撮剥削者致富，而是用来提高人们的生活水平和扩大生产。因此，七年之间，人民的消费将提高60％—63％。
    提高工资和农民收入
    七年间职工和集体农庄庄员实际收入都将增加40％，这是通过提高工资、增加农庄的社会生产、提高抚恤金和津贴等办法而实现的。
    七年计划规定，在普遍提高工资的同时，将注意提高低工资和中等工资，以缩小低工资和中等工资同高工资之间的差异，七年之内低工资将提高近一倍。
    为适应工农业生产的发展和居民收入的增加，国营商业和合作社商业的零售商品流转额在七年内将增加57％—62％。七年之内出售给居民的畜产品将增加一点二倍，植物油将增加90％，水果和柑桔类将增加一点五到二倍。糖的生产量，按人口计算将达到每年四十一到四十四公斤（1958年只达到二十六公斤），以全部的糖产量计算，1965年苏联的糖产量将增加到一千万吨，这个产量将占全世界砂糖总产量的五分之一，比美、英、法、西德、意大利、西班牙、比利时、荷兰、瑞典和印度等十个国家的糖产量的总和还要多。同时出售给居民的重要工业品，如纺织品、衣服和鞋类的数量也将大大增加，到1965年，按人口平均计算的产量差不多都将接近美国的水平。
    此外，出售给居民的文化与生活以及经济用途的商品数量，特别是那些减轻妇女在日常生活中的劳动的商品：洗衣机、电动地板擦、吸尘器、电熨斗、家用冰箱的数量将要大大增加。与前七年相比，洗衣机和餐具将增加七点八倍，出售给居民的家用冰箱的数量将增加四点六倍，缝纫机增加一点一倍，电视机增加三点六倍，收音机增加70％，摩托车和轻便摩托车增加一点七倍，出售给居民的标准房屋数量将增加六倍，水泥增加一点八倍，软屋面增加一点一倍，窗玻璃增加60％。这也就是说，七年以后苏联人民将吃得更好，穿得更漂亮，住得更舒适。
    世界上最短的工作日
    为了使苏联人民有更多的时间来学习、休息和照顾家庭，根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，苏联从1956年已开始实行星期六和节日前一天的工作日减少两小时。去年年底，莫斯科的一些工厂、顿巴斯沃林煤矿区、黑色冶金部门和化学工业部门的20％以上的企业，以及机器制造业的几百个工厂都已实行了七小时工作制。某些劳动较繁重、对身体健康不利的行业也在逐步实行六小时工作制。七年计划在这方面又作出了进一步的规定，预定在1968年完全实现五个工作日的工作周制（每天工作六至七小时，每周有两天的假日）。这样一来，在苏联将实行世界上最短的工作日和最短的工作周制。
