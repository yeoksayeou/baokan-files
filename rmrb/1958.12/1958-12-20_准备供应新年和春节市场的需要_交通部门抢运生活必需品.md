Xinhua News Agency, December 19th -- To cooperate with the commercial departments in providing people's daily necessities and ensuring the supply for the market around the New Year and Spring Festival, so that the broad masses of people can eat well, dress well, and spend the New Year and Spring Festival happily, the Ministry of Communications issued a transportation circular to all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions on the 17th. It requested that in the arrangement of material transportation in the middle and late ten days of December, in addition to continuing to ensure steel production transportation, especially the transfer of pig iron, the urgent task should be to use more transport capacity to rush the transport of people's daily necessities. An immediate effort must be made to launch another campaign to rush the transport of people's daily necessities, transporting daily-use industrial products to the countryside, non-staple foods to the cities, and also to rush the transport of industrial raw materials.

The Ministry of Communications circular pointed out that some time ago, due to the tension in steel production transportation, the transfer of these materials was not done well enough, which was unavoidable. Now that the task of 10.7 million tons of steel is nearing completion, it is necessary and possible to put the transportation of these materials in a prominent position, making it the focus for the current period. Short-distance transportation should be vigorously grasped, so that daily-use industrial products sent from the main lines can be quickly transferred to the countryside, and agricultural and sideline products from the countryside can be concentrated on the main lines in large quantities and organized for transportation to the cities. All localities must fully recognize that completing these tasks lies in doing a meticulous job of transportation organization. The transportation departments at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels must rely on the Party committees to carry out comprehensive deployment, help the county and township levels to grasp short-distance transportation, and make transportation arrangements for the cargo distribution centers along the entire line according to the transportation routes, and help the key prefectures and counties and townships for transportation in this province to do a good job in deployment. Only in this way can the long-distance transportation on the main lines and the short-distance transportation on the branch lines be closely combined. Not only must there be a complete set of arrangements for rushing the transportation of New Year's goods, but also such organizational work must be done well in other normal transportation.

The circular pointed out: As long as we rely on the leadership of the Party committee, make unified arrangements, strengthen organizational work, and fully mobilize the masses, the current task can be completed.

    准备供应新年和春节市场的需要
    交通部门抢运生活必需品
    新华社19日讯  为了配合商业部门做好人民日用生活必需品的供应以及新年和春节前后市场的供应，使广大人民吃好穿好，欢乐地度过新年和春节，交通部在17日向全国各省、市、自治区发出的一个运输通报中，要求各地在中下旬的物资运输安排上，除了仍然要保证钢铁生产运输，特别是生铁调运任务以外，突出的紧急任务是要用较多的运力抢运人民生活必需品。要立即动手再展开一个突击抢运人民生活必需品的运动。把日用工业品送到农村，把副食品送到城市，并且还要突击运输工业原料。
    交通部通报指出，在前些时候，由于钢铁生产运输紧张，这些物资的调运做得不够，这是不可避免的。现在一千零七十万吨钢的任务接近完成了，因此，我们有必要也有可能把这些物资的运输放到突击的地位，使它成为目前一个时期内的重点。要把短途运输有力地抓起来，使从干线送去的日用工业品赶快转送到农村，使农村的农产品、副食品大量地集中到干线，并组织车船送到城市。各地都要充分认识到，完成这些任务在于做好细致的运输组织工作。省、市、自治区一级运输部门，必须依靠党委，进行全面部署，帮助县乡一级把短途运输抓起来。按照运输线路，作出全线货物集散点的运输安排，并且帮助本省运输的重点专区和县乡做好布置。这样才能使干线长途运输和支线短途运输紧密地结合起来。不仅在突击年关物资运输中必须有整套的布置，就是在其他正常运输中，也都要做好这种组织工作。
    通报指出：只要依靠党委领导，统一安排，加强组织工作，充分发动群众，当前的任务是可以完成的。
