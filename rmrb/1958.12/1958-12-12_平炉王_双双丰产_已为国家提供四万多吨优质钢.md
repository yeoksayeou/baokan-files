Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th: The two large fixed open-hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, hailed as the "Open Hearth King," have been operating normally since they were put into production on October 31st and November 20th, respectively. As of the 10th, they have produced more than 44,000 tons of high-quality steel. The charging capacity has increased from more than 440 tons to 660 tons, an increase of 32% over the original design level, and the utilization coefficient has reached above twelve.

The steelworkers have demonstrated a high degree of responsibility and cooperation in ensuring the normal production of these two open-hearth furnaces. After the new open-hearth furnaces were put into production, because a section of the crane track had not yet been completed, one slag outlet could not be used for slag pots and had to pour the slag on the ground. The workers in the ingot casting section were afraid that high piles of slag would affect the timely release of slag from the open-hearth furnace and prolong the smelting time, so they cleaned it up shovel by shovel before the slag dissipated its high temperature. The workers responsible for minor repairs knew that there were no spare parts for the furnace, so they checked and repaired diligently, and carried out non-stop furnace repairs several times in high temperatures, so that the open-hearth furnace did not delay production due to equipment problems.

The workers also put forward many innovative suggestions to maximize the capacity of the open-hearth furnace equipment. The open-hearth furnace workers creatively adopted a new technology of using pulverized coke to block the slag outlet, which enabled the slag outlet to be opened and the slag to be discharged in a timely manner, which powerfully guaranteed the shortening of the smelting time. In the past, several older fixed open-hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel had major accidents due to poor maintenance of the taphole, resulting in steel leakage after tapping. The workers learned from this lesson and took many new measures to eliminate the accident of steel leakage after tapping on these two open-hearth furnaces.

    “平炉王”双双丰产
    已为国家提供四万多吨优质钢
    新华社鞍山11日电  号称“平炉之王”的鞍钢两座大型固定式平炉，自10月31日和11月20日分别投入生产以来，生产情况正常，到10日为止已经生产出四万四千多吨品质优良的钢，装入量由四百四十多吨扩大到六百六十吨，比原设计水平提高32％，利用系数达到十二以上。
    炼钢工人们在保证这两座平炉正常生产过程中发挥了高度的责任感和协作精神。新建平炉投入生产以后，由于一段吊车轨道还没有建成，使一个出渣口不能换渣罐，只得把渣淌在地上。铸锭工段的工人们恐怕堆得高了会影响平炉及时放渣，延长熔炼时间，便不等渣子散去高温，就一锹一锹地把它清理干净。担负小修理的工人们知道炉子配件没有备品，就勤检查勤修理，几次耐着高温进行不停炉修理，使平炉没有因设备问题而耽误生产。
    工人们还提出了许许多多革新建议，来发挥平炉设备能力。平炉工人创造性地采用焦炭粉堵渣口的新技术，使渣口能及时打开，及时放渣，有力地保证了熔炼时间的缩短。鞍钢几座老一点的固定式平炉过去曾因出钢槽维护不好发生过炉后跑钢的重大事故。工人们接受这个教训，采取很多新措施，在这两座平炉上消灭了炉后跑钢事故。
