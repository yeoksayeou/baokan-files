Combining Power Decentralization at the Commune and Brigade Levels, While Emphasizing Both Size and Side Occupations
Qianyang Special District Comprehensively Develops Diversified Operations and Gains Experience

(Reported by this newspaper) Since the establishment of 134 people's communes in Hunan Province's Qianyang Special District in September, due to the full utilization of the superiority of the people's communes and the comprehensive development of diversified operations, the cash income from diversified operations in the past two months has reached 15,465,700 yuan, with an average income of 29 yuan per household. This has enabled the commune to have monthly income, issue wages on time, and ensure every family has pocket money, thereby further promoting industrial and agricultural production.

The mountainous Qianyang Special District is rich in resources and has many avenues for side occupations. Diversified operations have always accounted for a large proportion of farmers' income. In early October, while focusing on steel production and autumn harvesting and planting, various regions, based on the characteristics of mountainous areas, adapted to local conditions, time, and people, rationally arranged labor, and adhered to diversified operations. In the past two months, farmers throughout the district, based on the principle of "relying on the mountains for sustenance," have successively carried out various production activities such as timber, nan bamboo, digging wild yams, and collecting wild plants. They have also utilized water power to establish paper mills, oil pressing workshops, rice milling workshops, and other processing factories. The entire district has also vigorously developed animal husbandry, resulting in a new situation of comprehensive great leaps forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fisheries.

In the process of developing diversified operations, Qianyang Special District has explored some successful experiences. First, the party committees at all levels comprehensively planned, uniformly arranged labor, and strengthened specific leadership over diversified operations. From the district committee to the county committee and the commune, there was a party committee member responsible for leading diversified operations. In early October, some areas experienced the erroneous idea of "labor is tight, so diversified operations should be temporarily put aside." The party committees in various regions promptly organized discussions and debates among cadres and the masses to correct their ideological understanding, mobilized the masses to tap labor potential, specifically arranged industrial, agricultural, and diversified operations production, and promptly reversed the stagnant situation. Therefore, during the extremely tense stage of focusing on steel production and autumn harvesting and planting, the entire district still maintained more than 50,000 people engaged in diversified operations, generally maintaining around 200,000 people (accounting for more than 14% of the district's labor force) regularly engaged in diversified operations.

Second, various regions, based on the characteristics of the people's communes being both large and public, expanded the scale of diversified operations. After the people's communeization of Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County, the county party committee immediately mobilized the county's townships and communes to build 2,428 livestock farms. In the past two months, the county's pig breeding has reached more than 30,000 heads. Some communes in Chenxi, Xupu, Yuanling, and other counties have adopted the method of "two unifieds" (unified planning, unified leadership) and "three guarantees" (guaranteed cost, guaranteed income, guaranteed product quality) with rewards for overproduction, implementing decentralized management by communes and brigades. The large-scale seasonal projects are managed uniformly by the commune, while the small-scale regional projects with smaller quantities are managed by the brigade on a contract basis. This not only ensures the development of the commune's large-scale side occupations, but also ensures that small-scale side occupations are not overlooked, fully leveraging the initiative of the brigades and production teams.

Third, adapt to the new organizational forms of production, rationally arrange labor, adopt the methods of "three grasps" (grasp the season, grasp technology, grasp gaps), "five determinations" (determine labor, determine time, determine leadership, determine quality, determine cost), and "seize every opportunity," to strengthen the arrangement and management of labor and tap labor potential.

Fourth, in the comprehensive development of diversified operations, the financial and trade departments vigorously cooperated and coordinated, carried out purchasing work, and adopted methods such as contract purchasing, canteen purchasing, and credit acceptance (i.e., commune guaranteed production, collection, packaging, and transportation) on a commune-by-commune basis to promote the development of diversified operations.

The comprehensive development of diversified operations not only guarantees the wage income of all commune members and provides capital for commune infrastructure construction, but also repays national loans. At present, in addition to purchasing a large number of new agricultural tools, all communes in the district have repaid national loans of 5.83 million yuan, including more than 2 million yuan of personal loans from commune members.

    社队分权大小兼顾搞副业
    黔阳专区全面开展多种经营取得经验
    本报讯  湖南省黔阳专区一百三十四个人民公社在9月份建成以后，由于充分发挥人民公社的优越性，全面开展多种经营，两个多月来多种经营的现金收入已有一千五百四十六万五千七百元，每户平均收入达二十九元。这个社已经作到了月月有收入，按时发工资，家家有零花钱，因而进一步推动了工农业生产。
    多山的黔阳专区物产丰富，副业门路多，多种经营一向在农民收入中占很大比重。10月初，各地在大抓钢铁生产和秋收秋种的同时，根据山区特点，因地因时因人制宜，合理安排了劳动力，坚持了多种经营。两月来全区农民根据靠山吃山的原则，先后开展了木材、楠竹、挖山药、采集野生植物等多种生产活动；还利用水力开办造纸厂、油榨坊、碾米坊等加工工厂；全区还大力发展了畜牧生产，出现了农、林、牧、副、渔全面大跃进的新局面。
    黔阳专区在开展多种经营的过程中，摸索出一些成功经验。首先是各级党委全面规划，统一安排劳力，加强了对多种经营的具体领导。由地委直到县委、公社都有一个党委委员负责领导多种经营。10月初部分地区曾一度出现“劳动紧张，多种经营暂时放一放”的错误思想，各地党委及时在干部和群众中组织鸣放辩论，端正了干群思想认识，发动群众挖掘了劳动潜力，具体安排了工业、农业和多种经营生产，及时扭转停滞状态。因此在大抓钢铁生产和秋收秋种劳动极其紧张的阶段，全区仍然保持了五万余人从事多种经营，一般情况下保持在二十万人左右（占全区劳动力的14％以上）经常开展多种经营。
    其次，各地根据人民公社既大又公的特点，扩大多种经营的规模。新晃侗族自治县人民公社化后，县委立即发动全县乡、社兴建畜牧场二千四百二十八个，两月来全县生猪繁殖达三万多头。辰溪、溆浦、沅陵等县的部分公社，采取“两统”（统一规划，统一领导）、“三包”（包成本、包收入、包产品质量）、超产奖励的办法，实行社、队分权管理，将大宗的有季节性的项目，由公社统一经营；一般数量少的有地区性的小项目，由大队包干管理。这样既保证了公社大宗副业的发展，也保证了小项副业不致遗漏，充分发挥大队和生产队的积极性。
    第三，适应新的生产组织形式，合理安排劳力，采取“三抓”（抓季节、抓技术、抓空隙），“五定”（定劳力、定时间、定领导、定质量、定成本）和“见缝插针”的办法，加强劳动力的安排和管理，挖掘劳动潜力。
    第四，在全面开展多种经营中，财贸部门大力协作配合，开展收购工作，以公社为单位采取合同收购、食堂收购、信用验收（即公社包产、包收、包装运）等办法，促进多种经营发展。
    多种经营的全面发展，不仅保证了全区社员的工资收入，提供了公社基建资金，同时还归还了国家贷款。目前全区各公社除了添置大批新式农具，并归还了国家贷款五百八十三万元，其中社员个人贷款也归还了二百多万元。
