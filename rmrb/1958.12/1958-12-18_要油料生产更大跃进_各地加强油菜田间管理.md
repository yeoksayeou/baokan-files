To Achieve a Greater Leap Forward in Oil Production
Various Regions Strengthen Field Management of Rapeseed

This newspaper reports that all regions across the country are strengthening field management of rapeseed. Currently, with the exception of the provinces and regions of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and a few areas that are still rushing to transplant seedlings, the winter sowing of rapeseed in most areas has ended. According to preliminary statistics, the total winter rapeseed planting area across the country this year may reach approximately fifty million mu. The rapeseed that was planted earlier in various regions has already grown five to seven leaves and is generally growing well. As long as cultivation and management are strengthened, there is great hope for increased production next year.

Hunan and Hubei provinces have expanded rapeseed planting the most this year. In order to ensure a bumper oil harvest next year, many regions, on the basis of successfully completing the planting tasks, are focusing on rapeseed field management. Since early November, the four special districts of Xiangtan, Hengyang, Changde, and Qianyang in Hunan Province have successively organized 1.1 million people to carry out topdressing, weeding, and pest control. In mid-November, the Jingzhou Prefectural Committee of Hubei Province held an on-site meeting in Songzi, a county with high rapeseed yields, to summarize the county's rapeseed cultivation and management experience, and launched a high tide of rapeseed field management throughout the region. After the on-site meeting in Shishou County, through a major inspection and field rectification, more than 200,000 people in the county carried out rapeseed replanting, seedling transplantation, and topdressing every day. Many regions in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces are also actively carrying out rapeseed field management activities. Under the requirement of "managing the young spring seedlings well to ensure full and strong seedlings," the Nanchong Special District of Sichuan Province has greatly strengthened the responsibility system for field management by focusing on ideology and adding measures. The rapeseed planted earlier in the Neijiang Special District has generally been topdressed once, and diseases and insect pests have been comprehensively and promptly prevented and controlled. After realizing the necessity of strengthening winter and spring field management for bumper harvests of spring crops through debate, the Yaxi grassroots cooperative of the Zunyi People's Commune in Guizhou Province, within a few days, replanted 420 mu of seedlings, topdressed more than 1,200 mu, weeded more than 1,900 mu, irrigated more than 800 mu, and used "666" pesticide powder to control insects on 570 mu. Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have carried out field management relatively late due to the large number of transplanted rapeseed, but some regions have also taken action. After criticizing the complacent and slack mood of "emphasizing planting and neglecting management" of summer crops, the people's communes in Liu'an County, Anhui Province, have launched a high tide of vigorous field management. The 750,000 mu of summer crops in the county have generally been ditched once. The rapeseed planted before the "frost's descent" has all been weeded once and is being topdressed. Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, planted 180,000 mu of rapeseed this year. After completing the planting task, the county party committee promptly shifted the focus of work to the cultivation and management of rapeseed fields. By December 3, the county had carried out two major inspections, topdressed more than 200,000 mu, irrigated more than 27,000 mu to fight drought, controlled pests on more than 60,000 mu, and completed ditching, earthing up, and setting up barriers to prevent cold on more than 33,000 mu.

However, from the current national perspective, the development of rapeseed field management work is still very uneven. The field management in many regions is still not commensurate with the established yield targets. According to typical surveys in Hunan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, and other places, there are not only more missing seedlings in this year's rapeseed fields, but also about 20% of the rapeseed is growing poorly. The missing seedling rate of rapeseed in the Ningbo and Jiaxing special districts of Zhejiang Province is generally above 15%-20%. The phenomenon of yellowing and lack of fertilizer in rapeseed seedlings is also common. In the Bijie Special District of Guizhou Province, about 40% of the rapeseed and wheat seedlings are uneven. In Jiangkou County, 70% of the rapeseed and wheat in the 4,000 mu of high-yield fields have been found to have pests. Similar situations also exist in some places in Shaanxi and Yunnan.

This newspaper reports that the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Pingjiang, Hunan, planted 45,000 mu of rapeseed this year, including 26,000 mu of satellite fields, accounting for 60% of the total rapeseed area. In order to strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest next year, the commune has universally promoted a rapeseed file system throughout the commune to strengthen the management of rapeseed, so that it can successfully survive the frost period and ensure the realization of the rapeseed production increase plan.

The main management methods of the rapeseed file system are: taking the company (squadron) as the unit, dividing the production area, establishing a professional team, and contracting the rapeseed from planting to harvesting to the class and to the individual, implementing the "three special" methods of special cadre leadership, special personnel cultivation, and special allocation of fertilizers. In order to clarify responsibilities, register on the production card: crop area, yield target, specific production increase measures, etc., establish a book for each class, and file it by company (squadron).

According to the commune members, this file system has three major benefits: 1. The responsibility is assigned to the individual, the measures are assigned to the field, and the commune members' sense of responsibility is greatly strengthened; 2. The measures are specific, the inspection is convenient, which is conducive to the leaders to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner; 3. Every step has a record, which is convenient for summarizing production increase techniques and promoting advanced experience in the future. After this method was universally implemented throughout the commune, it has had a very good effect. By the end of November, the rapeseed in the entire commune had been thoroughly processed and topdressed once according to the plan; more than 4,000 mu of rapeseed fields that had been flooded have been completely dug with deep ditches. At present, the rapeseed is growing generally well, and the commune members are stepping up the second processing and topdressing.

    要油料生产更大跃进
    各地加强油菜田间管理
    本报讯  全国各地正在加强油菜田间管理。目前各地油菜冬播工作，除福建、广东、广西三省区和少数育苗移栽的地区，还在抢栽以外，大部地区都已结束。据初步统计，全国今年冬油菜的种植面积，可达到五千万亩左右。各地早种的油菜，已生出五至七片叶子，一般生育良好，只要加强培育管理，明年增产大有希望。
    湖南、湖北两省，今年扩种油菜最多，他们为了打响明年油料丰收的第一炮，不少地区在胜利完成种植任务的基础上，大抓油菜田间管理。湖南省湘潭、衡阳、常德、黔阳四个专区，在11月上旬以来，先后组织了一百一十万人进行追肥、除草和治虫。湖北省荆州地委，11月中旬已在油菜丰产县松滋召开现场会议，总结了该县油菜的培育管理经验，掀起了全区油菜田间管理的高潮。这个省的石首县在现场会议以后，通过大检查和田间整风，全县每天有二十多万人进行油菜的补种、移苗和追肥。四川、贵州等省的不少地区也积极开展了油菜田间管理活动。四川省南充专区在“管好小春幼苗，保证苗全苗壮”的要求下，通过抓思想、添措施，大大加强了田间管理责任制。内江专区种得早的油菜，已普遍追肥一次，并且全面地、及时地防治了病虫害。贵州省遵义人民公社鸭溪基层社，通过辩论，在认识到小春作物丰产要加强冬春田间管理的必要性以后，几天内，就补苗四百二十亩，追肥一千二百多亩，除草一千九百多亩，浇水八百多亩，用“六六六”药粉治虫五百七十亩。安徽、江苏、浙江，由于移栽的油菜较多，田间管理工作开展较晚，但是部分地区也已行动起来。安徽省六安县各人民公社，在批判了对夏熟作物“重种轻管”的自满松劲情绪以后，已掀起了猛抓田间管理高潮，全县七十五万亩夏熟作物，已普遍清沟一次，“霜降”前种的油菜，已全部锄了一次草，并且正在进行追肥。浙江省慈溪县今年种十八万亩油菜，在完成种植任务后，县委就将工作重心及时转向油菜田的培育管理工作，到12月3日，全县已进行两次大检查，已追肥二十多万亩，浇水抗旱二万七千多亩，治虫六万多亩，做好清沟、壅土、夹障防寒的达三万三千多亩。
    但从目前全国来看，油菜田间管理工作开展的还很不平衡。不少地区的田间管理和已定的产量指标相比还不相适应。据湖南、贵州、浙江等地的典型调查，今年的油菜田不仅缺苗较多，而且有20％左右的生长较差。浙江省宁波、嘉兴两个专区，油菜缺苗率一般在15％—20％以上。菜苗发黄缺肥现象也较普遍。贵州省毕节专区约有40％的油菜、小麦出苗不齐，江口县在四千亩丰产田里发现70％的油菜和小麦有虫害。陕西、云南有些地方，也有同样情况。
    本报讯  湖南平江东方红人民公社今年播种油菜四万五千亩，其中卫星田二万六千多亩，占油菜总面积60％。这个社为了争取明年油菜大丰收，在全社范围内普遍推行油菜档案制，以加强对油菜的管理，使其胜利地渡过霜冻期，保证实现菜籽的增产计划。
    油菜档案制的管理的方法主要是：以连（中队）为单位，划分生产区、建立专业队，把油菜从种到收，一直包到班、包到人，实行专干领导，专人培育，专批肥料的“三专”办法。为了明确责任，并在生产卡片上登记：作物面积、产量指标、具体增产措施等，以班立簿，以连（中队）存档。
    据这个社社员反映，这种档案制度有三大好处：1、责任到了人，措施到了田，社员的责任心大大加强；2、措施具体，检查便利，有利于领导及时发现问题，解决问题；3、项项工夫有记载，便于今后总结增产技术，推广先进经验。这个办法在全社普遍执行以后，已有很好效果，至11月底，全社的油菜都已按计划全面进行了一次加工追肥；四千多亩被水渍的油菜田，已全部挖了深沟。目前油菜生长普遍良好，社员们正在抓紧进行第二次加工追肥。
