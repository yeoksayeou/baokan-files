Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 24th: The textile machinery manufacturing industry in Henan Province has launched a technical innovation movement, continuously equipping the textile industry with textile machinery that has higher production efficiency over the past year.

This year, Henan Province's textile machinery manufacturing industry has seen new improvements, creations, and developments in various textile machinery, from spinning and weaving to dyeing. For example, the opening and cleaning cotton combined machine is 30% lighter than previous machines, its volume is reduced by half, and its power consumption is reduced by 44%, but the machine's production efficiency remains the same as before. This type of machine not only saves a large amount of steel raw materials in the manufacturing process, but also reduces factory building and power consumption when production departments adopt them, greatly reducing production costs. The hot air nozzle sizing machine, which was successfully trial-produced this year, has more than doubled the production efficiency compared to the old sizing machine, and the amount of metal used per machine has been reduced by 50% in the manufacturing process. The new type of printing and dyeing machine has a higher degree of automation and continuity, and can complete the work of the old machine in ten hours in two hours.

    用高效能机械武装纺织工业
    河南纺织机械部门开展革新运动
    据新华社郑州24日电  河南省纺织机械制造工业开展技术革新运动，一年来不断以生产效能更高的纺织机械装备了纺织工业。
    今年，河南省纺织机械制造工业从纺纱、织布到漂染等各种纺织机械，都有新的改进、创造和发展。如开清棉联合机比过去的机器重量减轻30％，体积缩小一半，动力消耗减少44％，但是机器的生产效能仍和过去一样。这种机器，不仅在制造的过程中可以节省大量钢铁原材料，生产部门采用它们以后，还可以减少厂房建筑，减少电力消耗，大大降低生产成本。今年试制成功的热风喷嘴式浆纱机，比老式浆纱机生产效能高一倍以上，在制造过程中每台机器的金属使用量减少了50％。新式的印染机自动化和连续化的程度比较高，可以把老式机器十小时的工作在两个小时内做完。
