Eliminating the Five Pests and Eradicating the Five Diseases
Anhui Launches Winter Hygiene Campaign

	(Our newspaper, Hefei dispatch) In order to eliminate the five pests and eradicate the five diseases, various regions of Anhui Province are launching a mass winter hygiene campaign.
	Since the beginning of this year, Anhui Province has made great achievements in eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eradicating endemic diseases, thanks to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels and the active efforts of the broad masses. In many places, sparrows and rats have become extinct, and flies and mosquitoes have been greatly reduced, resulting in significant changes in the overall sanitation of the province. In order to consolidate the achievements already made and implement the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision to "continue to carry out the elimination of the four pests," all parts of the province, starting in November, have closely integrated this work with production and launched the first concentrated week-long campaign focusing on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, unanimously proposing the slogan "Do not let mosquitoes and flies overwinter, do not let maggots share the soil." Fuyang Prefecture, Bengbu Prefecture, Bengbu City, Hefei City, and other places have formed specialized mosquito and fly elimination teams mainly composed of the elderly, children, and women, vigorously eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies. Jieshou, Yingshang, Fengtai, and other places, in conjunction with autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and deep plowing of the land, are eliminating field rats.
	During the concentrated week of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, many places carried out major "house movings" and thorough cleanings, combined with the winter manure accumulation campaign. Indoor and outdoor sanitation was universally cleaned, leaving no hiding places for mosquitoes and flies.
	The headquarters for eliminating the four pests in Bengbu, Ma'anshan, and other cities, which started this activity earlier, have organized inspection teams to conduct a major inspection of the work of each unit. The province has also drawn more than 40 people from relevant units to form eight working groups, which will go to various places to supervise, inspect, and provide technical guidance.
	The winter hygiene campaign for eliminating pests and diseases in Anhui Province has achieved great results due to the attention of Party committees at all levels, the full mobilization of the masses, and the close integration with production. According to statistics for the month of November alone, more than 1.3 million rats, more than 470,000 sparrows, 2,064 kilograms of mosquitoes, and nearly 4,000 kilograms of flies have been eliminated.
	Anhui Province also particularly emphasized sanitation management at construction sites in the pest and disease elimination campaign. At present, all steel construction sites in the province are equipped with health and medical organizations at all levels, and the sanitation of workers' dormitories and canteens has also been greatly improved, ensuring that workers can eat well, sleep well, and rest well. Due to the improvement of sanitation at construction sites, the number of diseases and work-related accidents at various construction sites has been greatly reduced.

    除五害  灭五病
    安徽掀起冬季卫生运动
    本报合肥电  安徽省各地区为了除净五害，灭尽五病，正掀起一个群众性的除害灭病的冬季卫生运动。
    今年以来，安徽省在除四害、讲卫生和消灭地方病工作方面，由于各级党委加强领导和广大群众的积极努力，已取得了巨大成绩。很多地方的麻雀、老鼠已经绝迹，苍蝇、蚊子大大减少，全省卫生面貌已有很大变化。为了巩固已取得的成绩，贯彻中共中央关于“继续开展除四害”的决定，从11月份起，全省各地都紧密结合生产，开展了以消灭过冬蚊蝇为中心的除四害、讲卫生的第一个突击周运动，一致提出“不让蚊蝇过冬，不让蛆虫共土”的行动口号。阜阳专区、蚌埠专区、蚌埠市、合肥市等地都以老年、儿童、妇女为主组成消灭蚊蝇专业队，大力消灭过冬蚊蝇。界首、颍上、凤台等地结合秋收、秋种和深翻土地等工作，在地内消灭野鼠。
    在除四害、讲卫生突击周中，许多地方都进行了大“搬家”，大洗刷，结合冬季积肥运动。普遍打扫室内外卫生，不让蚊蝇有躲藏的地方。
    开展这一活动较早的蚌埠、马鞍山等市的除四害总指挥部，已组织检查小组对各单位的工作情况进行了大检查。省里也由各有关单位抽调四十多人，组成了八个工作组，分别到各地督促，检查和进行技术指导。
    安徽省除害灭病的冬季卫生运动，由于各级党委重视，充分发动群众，紧密结合生产，已获得很大成绩。据11月一个月的统计，已消灭老鼠一百三十多万只，麻雀四十七万多只，蚊子两千零六十四公斤，苍蝇近四千公斤。
    安徽省在除害灭病运动中，还特别强调了工地卫生管理工作。目前全省钢铁工地层层都设有卫生医疗组织，工棚、食堂的卫生工作也有很大改善，保证了工人都能够吃好、睡好、休息好。由于工地卫生工作的改善，现在各工地的疾病、工伤事故已大大减少。
