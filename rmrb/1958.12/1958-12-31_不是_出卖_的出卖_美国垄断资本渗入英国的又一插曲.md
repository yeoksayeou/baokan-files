A Betrayal That Isn't "Betrayal"
    ——Another Episode of American Monopoly Capital Infiltration into Britain

    An Advertisement in "The Times"
    On December 16, 1958, the British "Times" published a huge advertisement by the British Aluminium Company, occupying half a page. The advertisement stated that the British Aluminium Company is the only company in Britain that produces pure aluminum ingots and has a history of sixty-five years. It has a subsidiary in Canada engaged in the production of aluminum ingots, cooperates with the Australian government in the construction of hydropower projects and the mining of bauxite, and is actively preparing to open an international aluminum company in West Africa. The advertisement claimed that, in order to realize its potential, the British Aluminium Company decided to accept investment from the Aluminum Company of America, but "this is not a sale. The British Aluminium Company has not been sold to the Americans."
    The struggle of American monopoly capital groups for the British Aluminium Company has been going on for more than a month. The huge advertisement in "The Times" meant that the development of the matter had reached its climax.

    A Heated Contest
    American monopoly capital groups had long planned to seize the British Aluminium Company in order to enter the Commonwealth market and infiltrate Britain's market in Western Europe. In 1957, several major American companies quietly bought up shares in the British Aluminium Company. Reynolds Metals Company of the United States and its subsidiary, Tube Investments Ltd., acquired nearly one million shares of the British Aluminium Company's small shares in one year. Alcoa adopted another approach. Starting in June 1958, the company directly negotiated with the board of directors of British Aluminium Company, preparing to invest 13.5 million pounds. In October, the negotiations began to take shape. In mid-November, the two parties signed an agreement, and the British Aluminium Company agreed that representatives of Alcoa would participate in the company's board of directors in the future. As soon as the news of the agreement between the British Aluminium Company and Alcoa came out, Reynolds Metals Company immediately announced: a public acquisition of shares of the British Aluminium Company. The stock of the British Aluminium Company was worth one pound per share. Reynolds Metals Company's acquisition price was three pounds and eighteen shillings per share, plus a share of Tube Investments Ltd. stock worth one pound.

    On December 15, Reynolds Metals Company officially began the acquisition and stated that January 9, 1959, would be the deadline. According to the "Times" on the same day, before the large-scale acquisition began, Reynolds Metals Company and Tube Investments Ltd. had already controlled 13% of the shares of the British Aluminium Company. The current acquisition may enable the two companies to control 90% of the shares of the British Aluminium Company.

    Reynolds Metals Company directly bought shares from shareholders, putting the board of directors of the British Aluminium Company, which had reached an agreement with Alcoa in the early stage, into an embarrassing situation. The huge advertisement in "The Times" on December 16, on the one hand, implied that the board of directors of the British Aluminium Company did not approve of shareholders selling their shares to Reynolds Metals Company, and on the other hand, it made a so-called "this is not a sale" cover-up for the transaction between the board of directors of the British Aluminium Company and Alcoa.

    A Wave of Protests
    The struggle of American monopoly capital groups for the British Aluminium Company has aroused great anger in British financial circles and the press. Even the British "Economist" magazine, which has always been pro-American, had to say: "...It is not difficult to see that the struggle between Alcoa and Reynolds Metals Company is to gain a firm foothold in the European and Commonwealth markets and squeeze each other out. These markets are markets with great potential, and the interests of the British Aluminium Company in these markets have aroused the covetousness of the two major companies." Beaverbrook's "Sunday Express" pointed out that American capital has greatly squeezed out Britain on all fronts. The Americans have stretched their palms into the Middle East oil-producing areas that were once completely under British control. "We gave them 40% of Abadan's oil business, we sold them the Trinidad Oil Company, and the dollar firmly grasped Jamaica's bauxite, Rhodesia's copper, and Canada's oil. Now, our aluminum is facing this danger again."

    不是“出卖”的出卖
    ——美国垄断资本渗入英国的又一插曲
    “泰晤士报”上的广告
    1958年12月16日，英国“泰晤士报”以半个版的篇幅，刊登了英国制铝公司的巨幅广告。广告说，英国制铝公司是英国唯一生产纯铝锭的公司，具有六十五年的历史。它在加拿大设有从事铝锭生产的子公司，与澳大利亚政府合作进行水力发电工程的建设与铁矾土的开采，还在西非洲积极筹备开设一个国际性的制铝公司。广告声称，为了发挥潜力，英国制铝公司决定接受美国铝公司的投资，但是，“这不是出卖。英国制铝公司并未出售给美国人。”
    美国垄断资本集团对英国制铝公司的争夺，进行了一个多月。“泰晤士报”的巨幅广告意味着事情的发展已经到了最高点。
    白热化的争夺战
    美国垄断资本集团早就打算夺取英国制铝公司，以打入英联邦市场，渗入英国在西欧的市场。1957年，美国若干大公司不动声色地暗中抢购英国制铝公司的股票。美国雷诺兹金属公司和它的分公司钢管投资有限公司，在一年间收买的英国制铝公司小额股票，将近一百万股。美国铝公司采用了另一种手法。这个公司从1958年6月起，直接与英国制铝公司董事会谈判，准备投资一千三百五十万英镑。10月，谈判初具眉目。11月中旬，双方签订协议，英国制铝公司同意美国铝公司代表将来参加该公司董事会。英国制铝公司与美国铝公司达成协议的消息一经传出，美国雷诺兹金属公司立即宣布：公开收购英国制铝公司的股票。英国制铝公司的股票每股价值一英镑。雷诺兹金属公司的收购价为每股三英镑十八先令，并附送钢管投资有限公司价值为一英镑的股票一张。
    12月15日，雷诺兹金属公司开始正式收购，并声明以1959年1月9日为截止日期。据同日“泰晤士报”消息，在大规模收购开始以前，雷诺兹金属公司及钢管投资有限公司已经控制了英国制铝公司13％的股票。现在开始的收购，可能使该两公司控制英国制铝公司90％的股票。
    雷诺兹金属公司直接向股东收买股票，使先期与美国铝公司达成协议的英国制铝公司董事会，陷入了狼狈的境地。12月16日，“泰晤士报”上的巨幅广告，一方面暗示英国制铝公司董事会不赞成股票持有人将股票出售给雷诺兹金属公司，另方面又为英国制铝公司董事会与美国铝公司之间的交易作了一番所谓“这不是出卖”的掩饰。
    一片抗议
    美国垄断资本集团对英国制铝公司的争夺，引起了英国金融界和报界极大的愤怒。向来以亲美著称的英国“经济学家”杂志也只得说：“……不难看出，美国铝公司与雷诺兹金属公司之间的争夺，是想在欧洲及英联邦市场中取得牢固的立足点，彼此排挤。这些市场是具有巨大潜力的市场，而英国制铝公司在这些市场中的利益，引起了两大公司的垂涎。”比维布鲁克的“星期日快报”指出，美国资本在全部战线上已经大大地排挤了英国，美国人把手掌伸入了当年曾经完全在英国控制之下的中东石油产地，“我们把阿巴丹的40％的石油生意让给了他们，我们把特立尼达石油公司卖给了他们，美元死死地抓住了牙买加的铁矾土、罗得西亚的铜和加拿大的石油。现在，我们的铝又面临着这种危险。”
