Everyone Argues Reason, Let's See Whose Dao is Higher?
Ning Zhiwen

The Xiquan Branch of the Youyi People's Commune in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, recently held a meaningful debate on the topic of "Why should we launch a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate?" and "How to use the method of great debate?"

The Party proposed using the method of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate to handle contradictions among the people more than a year ago. Isn't it late for this branch to organize a debate on "Why should we launch a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate" now? Not late, not late! Precisely because it has been implemented for more than a year, looking back and discussing it will deepen understanding. It's like eating olives; chewing them carefully after eating them for a while will give them more flavor.

Sure enough, after this debate in the Youyi People's Commune, the flavor came out. Some people didn't quite understand the wonders of the great debate before, but now they understand: "Debate is not a small matter, it is too important. If everyone speaks up and debates when something happens, production can be improved and life can be improved. Without debate, things cannot be done well." Some people realized that they had concerns about speaking at meetings in the past, which resulted in losses in production: "When planting in the spring, if everyone had debated, how could some fields not have produced good seedlings?" It can be seen that the benefits of the great airing of views, great contending, and great debate are becoming clearer and clearer, and are being grasped by more and more people.

Are there still people who are not very clear or not clear at all about the great airing of views, great contending, and great debate? It cannot be said that there are none at all. In a township in Kaiyuan County, south of Changtu, such a thing happened: a public canteen was not run well, and the pancakes were always undercooked. The masses had a lot of opinions, and the canteen manager heard them and became very angry: "Who says the pancakes are undercooked? You are sabotaging the collective canteen. Let's debate!" He was menacing, and his purpose was to punish those who made suggestions. Some villagers were indeed frightened by him and quickly said, "Not raw, cooked, cooked." This is really turning raw rice into cooked rice through debate.

Raw rice is always raw rice, and no matter how you debate, you can't cook it. This canteen manager is a bit too confused. However, since he gets angry as soon as he hears criticism, it is clear that he does not sincerely want to debate. Didn't you hear him immediately associate "raw pancakes" with "sabotaging the collective canteen"? That is the key. Raw pancakes are a small matter, but who can bear the responsibility for sabotaging the collective canteen? So, they have to say "cooked, cooked."

But what good does this kind of "cooked" do for the matter?

It seems that if we don't make those who resort to compulsory orders in the name of "let's debate" more clear-headed and calm, and correct their approach, the method of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate for correctly handling contradictions among the people will be misunderstood, the people's mood will not be happy, and a lively political situation will not be possible. As the members of the Youyi People's Commune said, production and life cannot be improved.

That canteen manager (and those who share his ideas) probably mistakenly thought that since the great debate was born in the anti-Rightist struggle, the method of struggle against the Rightists should also be used to handle contradictions among the people. These are two different types of contradictions, and also two different types of great debates. In the anti-Rightist struggle, that kind of great debate was for clarifying major issues of right and wrong among the people, isolating the enemy, making them notorious, and completely refuting them. But even towards the enemy, we are realistic and do not mess around, let alone within the people?

Our current nationwide Great Leap Forward is being formed on the basis of the rectification movement and the nationwide great debate. Now, looking back at the achievements of the great debate and discussing the method of the great debate is indeed beneficial. Didn't the debate in the Youyi People's Commune summarize a point? "The great debate is everyone arguing reason, let's see whose Dao is higher?" This sentence is correct. What is being contended is the reason of socialism, and what is being debated is the Dao of socialism. Anyway, the truth becomes clearer and clearer through contention and debate. Those who want to turn raw rice into cooked rice through debate are precisely because they have less reason and a lower Dao than others, so they use a last resort, which is not worth emulating.

    大家争理，看谁道高？
    宁志文
    辽宁省昌图县友谊人民公社西泉支部最近举行了一次有意义的辩论，辩论的题目，是“为什么要开展大鸣大放大辩论？”“怎样运用大辩论的方法？”
    党提出用大鸣大放大辩论的方法来处理人民内部矛盾，已经一年多了，这个支部到现在才组织辩论“为什么要开展大鸣大放大辩论”，岂不是迟了吗？不迟，不迟！正因为实行了一年多，回过头再看看，议论议论，才能加深体会。就如同吃橄榄，吃了一阵子再细细咀嚼，就会更有味道。
    果然，友谊人民公社这么一辩论，味道出来了。有人原来还不大明白大辩论的妙处，现在明白了：“辩论可不是件小事，太重要了，大伙要都说话，有事就辩论，生产就能搞好，生活就能提高，要不辩论，就不能搞好。”有人明白了过去开会有顾虑，不大爱说话，结果是生产上受了损失：“春天种地，大伙要是辩论辩论，哪能有些地没出好苗？”可见得，大鸣大放大辩论这件事的好处，也是愈远愈清楚，愈来愈被更多的人所掌握的。
    对大鸣大放大辩论还不甚清楚或者很不清楚的人，现在还有没有呢？也还不能说完全没有。就在昌图南边的开原县的一个乡里，发生过这么一件事：一个公共食堂办的不好，大饼老是生的，群众很有意见，在背地里议论，被食堂的管理人听到了，他就大发脾气：“谁说大饼生？破坏集体食堂，咱们辩论辩论！”他气势汹汹，目的是想处罚一下提意见的人。有些老乡果然就被他吓住了，赶紧说：“不生，熟了熟了。”这真是生米辩成熟饭了。
    生米总是生米，再辩也辩不成熟饭。这个食堂管理人未免太糊涂些。不过他既然一听到批评就冒火，可见他并不是真心想辩论。不听见他从大饼生立刻就联系到“破坏集体食堂”么？这就是关键所在。大饼生事小，破坏集体食堂，谁能担得起？那就只好“熟了熟了”。
    可是，这样的“熟了”，对事情又有什么好处呢？
    看来，如果不使这种动辄借“辩论辩论”之名实行强迫命令的人头脑清醒些，冷静些，纠正他们这种做法，大鸣大放大辩论这个正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法就要被误解，群众的心情就不会舒畅，生动活泼的政治局面也就不可能出现，就像友谊人民公社的社员说的，生产和生活都不可能搞好。
    那个食堂管理人（以及同他有相同思想的人）大约是由于大辩论这个方式诞生于反右派斗争，就误以为处理人民内部矛盾也要采用反右派的那种斗争的方式了。这是两种不同性质的矛盾，也是两种不同性质的大辩论。在反右派斗争中，那种大辩论是为了在人民群众中弄清大是大非，孤立敌人，把他们搞臭，把他们彻底驳垮。但即使对敌人，我们也是实事求是，不乱搞的，何况是在人民内部呢？
    我们今天的全民大跃进，正是在整风运动和全民大辩论的基础上形成的。现在来回头看看大辩论的成绩，议论议论大辩论的方法，确确实实有好处。友谊人民公社的辩论里不是总结出一条出来了吗？“大辩论就是大家争理，看谁道高？”这句话可说对了。争的是社会主义之理，辩的是社会主义之道，反正真理总是越争越清楚，越辩越明白的。那些想把生米辩成熟饭的人，正是因为理比别人少，道比别人低，才用了一条下策，那是不足为训的。
