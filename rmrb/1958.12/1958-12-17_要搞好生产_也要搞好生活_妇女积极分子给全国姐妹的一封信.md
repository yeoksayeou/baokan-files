Strive for Production and Life
A Letter from Women Activists to Sisters Across the Country

Dear Sisters Across the Country:

We, over two thousand five hundred women activist representatives from all over the motherland, have come to the great capital, Beijing, with boundless excitement to attend the National Conference of Women's Socialist Construction Activists. At the conference, Comrade Peng Dehuai gave us instructions on behalf of the Party Central Committee, and Comrade Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, gave us a report. Their words spoke to our hearts. At the conference, more than four hundred and seventy representatives made oral and written speeches, reporting on the achievements of women of all ethnic groups in the Great Leap Forward. We exchanged experiences and learned advanced ideas from each other. The conference was extremely successful. In these ten days, we received profound education, understood many principles, clarified the direction of our struggle, and gained more energy and methods. Each of us felt a thousand-fold increase in strength. We are extremely honored to be able to attend this conference. This honor is given to us by the Party and the state, and it is a shared honor for all sisters on all fronts of socialist construction.

At this conference, we more clearly understood the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: the task of the people of the whole country at the present stage is to build socialism, which is to continue to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; to turn our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture; and to lay a solid foundation for the future transition from socialist society to a more beautiful and happy communist society. Next year is the second year of the three years of hard struggle. The people of the whole country must complete and overfulfill the 1959 national construction plan; strive for a comprehensive and greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings; and actively carry out the work of rectification and consolidation of the people's communes, improve the operation and management of the communes, and improve the commune's production and collective life and welfare undertakings. We firmly believe that the sisters across the country certainly have such ambition and such confidence, and together with the people of the whole country, resolutely complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party.

The Party and the state have created all favorable conditions for our women to participate in social labor. We must work more actively and produce more diligently. At this conference, we saw more comprehensively that in the past year, the number of women participating in social labor has increased unprecedentedly, the scope of labor has expanded, and labor skills have improved. Outstanding achievements have been made on all fronts of socialist construction. Women's labor has received great respect from society. We deeply realize that actively participating in social labor is the fundamental condition for women to achieve complete liberation. We must continue to go all out and become a main force in agricultural production, striving for a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production next year. We must continue to strive for a greater leap forward in industrial production, strive to support and participate in steel and machinery production, and actively participate in the textile industry and other industrial construction. In transportation, commerce, culture, education, health, science, and other undertakings, our women must also play a greater role. We must also run collective life, welfare undertakings, and service industries better. For work suitable for women, we must actively participate according to national needs, gradually achieving female labor replacing male labor so that both male and female labor can be rationally used, fully exerting their active roles, and promoting a greater leap forward in production next year.

The Party teaches us that we must do a good job in production and also do a good job in life. Production and life must be done well simultaneously. The conference enthusiastically discussed this issue. We personally experienced that when collective life is done well, everyone's political enthusiasm is higher, labor momentum is greater, and production tasks can be completed better. We also personally experienced that when collective life is done well, the family is more democratic and united, men and women are more equal, and the feudal patriarchal system is being completely destroyed. After a family works, the old and the young gather together, affectionate and joyful. Our family life is becoming more and more happy.

Since communization, our women have actively participated in various collective life and welfare work, made achievements, and created experiences. Many sisters introduced concrete experiences in running these undertakings well, making us understand that to run collective life and welfare undertakings well, we must first run public canteens well, so that everyone can eat enough, eat well, eat cleanly and hygienically, and be satisfied. We must also run nurseries and kindergartens well, so that our children can grow well, be lively and healthy, develop good habits and good thoughts from an early age, and be cultivated into successors to the communist cause. In running nursing homes, maternity hospitals, sewing factories, shoe factories, disassembly and washing groups, and other undertakings, the sisters have also done a lot of work. In the future, we must also do everything possible to run various life and welfare undertakings better, and we must strive to be activists in these noble undertakings that serve the people, strive to be model cooks, childcare workers, educators, midwives, health workers, sewing workers, administrators, etc., and plant red flags all over all collective life and welfare undertakings.

Through this conference, we have further understood that to do a good job in production and run collective life and welfare undertakings well, we must adhere to putting politics in command. Under the leadership of the Party, we must strive to improve our political and ideological awareness, listen to the Party's words, resolutely follow the socialist road, and stand firm in the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Currently, the Party is guiding us to run the people's communes well. We deeply realize that running the people's communes well can greatly accelerate the pace of construction, lead the people of the whole country to a happier life, and women can achieve complete liberation more quickly. Therefore, all women in the country must love the people's communes, actively participate in various labor in the communes, cherish the property of the communes, participate in the rectification and consolidation of the communes with the attitude of masters, always consider the interests of the country and the collective, and resolutely overcome individualism and departmentalism. We must educate those with strong bourgeois ideology and help them transform their thinking. We must also improve our revolutionary vigilance at all times and in all places to prevent and thwart the enemy's sabotage activities.

In order to do a better job in production and life, we must also actively participate in the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Many sisters are now working hard to learn technology, some already have a specialty, and some have become all-rounders. This will improve labor efficiency, reduce labor intensity, and improve production and life. With culture, technology can be learned better and faster. Young and middle-aged women who are illiterate must make up their minds, establish perseverance, and remove the label of illiteracy. Those who have already become literate must constantly improve their cultural level. The facts reported by many sisters at the conference made us realize that as long as we dare to think, dare to act, learn humbly, and study diligently, no difficulty can overwhelm us. We must study hard and practice diligently, delve into technology, use our brains, improve tools, make up our minds, learn culture, and improve our construction skills. In this way, we can combine hard work and skillful work, be able to do well, do skillfully, and make greater contributions to socialist construction.

Dear Sisters! The Party tells us: we must work and also rest; we must fight hard and also recuperate; we must work and also have cultural entertainment. When we rest well, we have more energy and greater enthusiasm. We deeply realize that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao care for the people's lives with meticulous attention! The Party Central Committee also cordially instructed us women that during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, we should pay attention to necessary rest and nutrition; during menstruation and pregnancy, we should also pay attention to not doing heavy work and not going into cold water; before and after childbirth, we should rest well according to the regulations of the state and the commune. We should also pay attention to participating in physical exercise regularly to strengthen our physique. Only in this way can we guarantee sustained labor, maintain vigorous enthusiasm, and promote the leap forward and further leap forward of the socialist construction cause.

Dear Sisters: We must not forget that American imperialism is still carrying out war provocations and still occupies our territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands, conspiring to create "two Chinas." This is absolutely not allowed by us. We must work hard together with the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, to achieve the complete unification of our country, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

The conference is about to close victoriously. After we return to our work posts, we will definitely ensure the resolute implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee, conscientiously implement the spirit of the conference, be modest and prudent, not arrogant or impetuous; be realistic, not superficial or exaggerated; closely contact the masses, and do our work better. Dear sisters, let us unite closely, encourage each other, always listen to the Party, always be loyal to the cause of communism, and together with the people of the whole country, strive for a greater leap forward in 1959, and bravely advance towards socialist construction!

    要搞好生产  也要搞好生活
    妇女积极分子给全国姐妹的一封信
    亲爱的全国姐妹们：
    我们两千五百多名妇女积极分子代表，从祖国各地来到伟大的首都北京，抱着无限兴奋的心情，出席了全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议。在会议上，彭德怀同志代表党中央向我们作了指示，全国妇联主席蔡畅同志给我们作了报告，他们的话，句句说到了我们的心里。在会议上，有四百七十多名代表作了口头和书面的发言，汇报了各族妇女在大跃进中的成绩，我们相互交流了经验，学习了先进思想。会议开得好极了，在这十几天里，我们受到了深刻的教育，明白了很多道理，更明确了奋斗的方向，干劲更足了，办法也更多了。我们每个人都觉得增添了千百倍的力量。我们能够出席这次会议，感到十分光荣。这种光荣，是党和国家给我们的，是在建设社会主义各个战线上的全国姐妹们共同的光荣。
    在这次会上，我们更明确地领会了党中央和毛主席的指示：全国人民现阶段的任务是建设社会主义，就是要继续贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家，并且为将来从社会主义社会过渡到更加美好幸福的共产主义社会打下巩固的基础。明年是苦战三年的第二年，全国人民要完成和超额完成1959年国家建设计划；争取工农业生产和各项建设事业的全面的更大跃进；还要积极进行整顿和巩固人民公社的工作，改进公社的经营管理，把公社的生产和集体生活福利事业搞得更好。我们深信，全国姐妹们一定有这样的志气，有这样的信心，和全国人民在一起，坚决完成党交给我们的光荣任务。
    党和国家为我们妇女参加社会劳动创造了一切有利的条件，我们更要积极劳动，努力生产。在这次会议上，我们更全面地看到了过去一年，妇女参加社会劳动的人数空前增加了，劳动范围扩大了，劳动的本领提高了，在社会主义建设的各个战线上，都做出了出色的成就。妇女的劳动受到社会的极大尊重。我们深深体会到，积极参加社会劳动是妇女得到彻底解放的根本条件。我们要继续鼓足干劲，在农业生产上成为一支主力军，争取明年农业生产的更大丰收；我们要继续争取工业生产的更大跃进，努力支援和参加钢铁、机械生产，积极参加纺织业和其他各项工业建设；在交通运输、商业、文教、卫生、科学等各种事业中，我们妇女也要起更大的作用；还要把集体生活福利事业和服务性事业办得更好。对于适合妇女担任的工作，我们要根据国家需要积极参加，逐步做到以女替男，使男女劳动力都能得到合理使用，充分发挥积极作用，促进明年生产更大的跃进。
    党教导我们，要搞好生产，也要搞好生活。生产、生活要同时搞好。大会热烈地讨论了这个问题。我们亲身体会到集体生活搞得好，大家的政治热情更高，劳动劲头更大，生产任务就能完成得更好。我们也亲身体会到，集体生活搞好了，家庭也更加民主团结了，男女更加平等了，封建的家长制正在被彻底破坏。一家人劳动以后，老老少少，团聚一起，亲亲热热，欢欢喜喜，我们的家庭生活越来越幸福了。
    公社化以来，我们妇女积极参加了各项集体生活福利工作，做出了成绩，创造了经验。许多姐妹介绍了办好这些事业的具体经验，使我们懂得了要办好集体生活福利事业，首先要办好公共食堂，让大家吃得饱，吃得好，吃得干净卫生，称心如意。还要办好托儿所、幼儿园，让我们的孩子长得好，活泼健壮，从小养成好习惯、好思想，培养成为共产主义事业的接班人。在举办敬老院、妇产院、缝纫厂、做鞋厂、拆洗组等事业中，姐妹们也做了许多工作。今后，我们还要千方百计把各种生活福利事业办得更好，一定要在这些为人民服务的崇高事业中，争取当积极分子，争取做模范的炊事员、保育员、教养员、助产员、卫生员、缝纫员、管理员等等，把红旗插遍一切集体生活福利事业。
    通过这次大会，我们更加懂得了，要搞好生产，办好集体生活福利事业，都必须要政治挂帅。我们要在党的领导下，努力提高政治思想觉悟，一定要听党的话，坚决走社会主义道路，在社会主义、资本主义两条道路的斗争中间站稳立场。当前，党正引导着我们办好人民公社。我们深深体会到，办好人民公社，就能大大加快建设速度，把全国人民引向更幸福的生活，妇女就能更快地得到彻底解放。因此我们全国妇女都要热爱人民公社，积极参加公社的各项劳动，爱护公社的财产，要以主人翁的态度，参加整顿和巩固公社的工作，处处为国家利益、集体利益着想，坚决克服个人主义、本位主义思想。对有浓厚资产阶级思想的人，要进行教育，帮助他们改造思想。还要随时随地提高革命的警惕性，防止和粉碎敌人的破坏活动。
    为了把生产、生活搞得更好，我们还要积极参加技术革命、文化革命。现在已经有许多姐妹正在努力学习技术，有的已经有了一门专长，有的已经成为多面手，这样就能提高劳动效率，减轻劳动强度，把生产和生活搞得更好。有了文化，技术就可以学得更好、更快。不识字的青壮年妇女，要下决心，立恒心，摘掉文盲帽子；已经脱盲的要不断地提高文化水平。大会上许多姐妹汇报的事实，使我们认识到，只要敢想、敢干，虚心学习，刻苦钻研，什么困难也难不倒我们。我们一定要勤学苦练，钻研技术；开动脑筋，改良工具；下定决心，学习文化；提高我们的建设本领。这样，我们就能够把苦干和巧干结合起来，能够干得好，干得巧，为社会主义建设做出更大贡献。
    亲爱的姊妹们！党告诉我们：要劳动，也要休息；要苦战，也要休整；要干活，也要文化娱乐。休息好了，精神更足，干劲更大。我们深深体会到党中央和毛主席关怀人民生活，真是无微不至！党中央还亲切地嘱咐我们妇女，在怀孕、生孩子、奶孩子期间，要注意必要的休息和营养；来月经、怀孕期间，还要注意不做重活，不下冷水；产前产后要根据国家和公社的规定，好好休息。我们还要注意经常参加体育锻炼，增强体质。只有这样，才能保证持久的劳动，保持旺盛的干劲，促进社会主义建设事业的跃进再跃进。
    亲爱的姐妹们：我们还不能忘记，美帝国主义还在进行战争挑衅，还霸占着我国领土台湾和沿海岛屿，阴谋制造“两个中国”，这是我们绝对不允许的。我们一定要和全国人民一起，为解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，为实现我国的完全统一，为保卫远东和世界和平而努力奋斗！
    大会就要胜利闭幕了。我们回到工作岗位以后，一定保证坚决执行党中央的指示，认真贯彻大会的精神，谦虚谨慎，不骄傲、不急躁；实事求是，不虚浮、不夸大；密切联系群众，把工作做得更好。亲爱的姐妹们，让我们紧密团结，互相勉励，永远听党的话，永远忠实于共产主义事业，和全国人民一起，为争取1959年的更大跃进，为建设社会主义奋勇前进！
