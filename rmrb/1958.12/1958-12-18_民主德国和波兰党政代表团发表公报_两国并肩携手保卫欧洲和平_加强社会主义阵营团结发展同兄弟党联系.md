Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 16th: According to a report by the German News Agency, the joint communiqué of the party and government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Polish People's Republic was published on the evening of the 15th. The communiqué stated that both sides reached an agreement on all issues discussed.

Regarding the political situation, both sides believed: "The development of the European situation is the main issue of their concern, and they call on all European people to remain vigilant." The communiqué pointed out that the proposals of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and other socialist countries regarding achieving peace in Europe have been rejected by Western countries. Western countries continue to pursue the goal of subordinating the whole of Germany to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The increasing tension is particularly caused by the Federal Republic of Germany, "and the main center of the threat to peace in Europe exists there."

The communiqué continued, "The failure of the United States' policy of interfering in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, the victory of the Asian and African people's struggle for independence, and the failure of imperialist armed intervention in the Middle East - all these factors prove the hopelessness of the policy of strength more convincingly than ever before."

The communiqué emphasized: "The armaments policy increasingly stubbornly pursued by the (West German) Federal Republic government poses a threat to all European people, particularly because the Federal Republic is the only country in Europe that makes territorial demands on other countries." The communiqué stated: "Starting from the requirements of their common security and the inviolability of their borders, both sides unanimously believe that any attack on the territorial integrity of the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, or any other member state of the Warsaw Treaty will be met with a resolute counterattack by all countries of the Warsaw Treaty."

The communiqué said that West Berlin is a serious center of tension. "The violation of the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the prevention of the revival of German militarism and revanchism, the militarist path taken by the Federal Republic of Germany, including equipping its defense forces with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, and the Federal Republic government's stubborn pursuit of a policy of revenge have aggravated the West Berlin issue." The communiqué pointed out that both sides support the proposals outlined in the Soviet note on the Berlin issue.

The communiqué said that the main concern of the people of all countries at present is to eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons, immediately cease nuclear weapons testing, completely ban nuclear weapons, reduce conventional armaments, and eliminate foreign military bases on the territory of other countries. Achieving progress on this issue is a basic prerequisite for moving towards easing the international situation. Both sides fully support the Soviet Union's initiative to hold a summit meeting.

The communiqué said that only those who are unwilling to ease the international situation and who base their political concepts on the atomic arming of the West German army would fundamentally obstruct Poland's initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Their concept is currently the main threat to peace in Europe and must therefore be overcome.

The communiqué emphasized that both sides will never relax their struggle to win collective security and the victory of the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. To achieve peaceful coexistence, the two countries will further strive to expand their economic, cultural, and other ties with other countries, which are not affected by differences in social systems.

The communiqué said that delegations from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Polish United Workers' Party extensively exchanged views on the socialist construction of the two countries, the work of the two parties, the relations between the two parties, and the current important issues of the international workers' movement.

The two parties unanimously believe: "An uncompromising struggle against revisionism is a necessary prerequisite for the successful carrying out of socialist construction." Both sides believe that it is necessary to combat symptoms of dogmatism. Representatives of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Polish United Workers' Party pledged loyalty to proletarian internationalism and cooperation between fraternal parties in the spirit of the principles laid down in the Moscow Declaration of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The communiqué added: "The solidarity of the socialist camp, the strength of the Soviet Union as the foremost socialist country, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries are of decisive significance for protecting their construction, maintaining peace, and consolidating all peace forces in the world."

The two parties announced that they will further strengthen cooperation and fraternal ties with all communist and workers' parties. In order to enhance the fraternal relations between the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Polish United Workers' Party, more party delegations will be exchanged, and it is planned to jointly participate in important theoretical conferences.

The communiqué concluded that cooperation and friendship between the German Democratic Republic and Poland are an important factor for peace and security in Europe. Both sides are determined to further strengthen this friendly relationship.

    民主德国和波兰党政代表团发表公报
    两国并肩携手保卫欧洲和平
    加强社会主义阵营团结发展同兄弟党联系
    新华社柏林16日电  据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国和波兰人民共和国两国党和政府代表团会谈公报已经在15日晚间发表。公报说，双方在所讨论的一切问题上都达成了协议。
    关于政治局势，双方认为：“欧洲局势的发展情况是它们所挂虑的主要问题，它们要求全体欧洲人民保持警惕”。公报指出，苏联、民主德国、波兰和其他社会主义国家关于使欧洲获得和平的建议都遭到了西方国家的拒绝。西方国家继续追求使整个德国隶属于北大西洋集团这个目标。造成紧张局势加剧的原因特别是来自德意志联邦共和国，“而对欧洲和平的威胁的主要中心就存在在那里”。
    公报接着说，“美国干涉中华人民共和国内政的政策的失败，亚非人民争取独立的斗争的胜利，帝国主义武装干涉中东的失败——所有这些因素都比以前任何时候更加令人信服地证明了实力政策的没有希望。”
    公报强调指出：“（西德）联邦共和国政府越来越顽固地执行的军备政策，造成了对全体欧洲人民的威胁，特别是由于联邦共和国是欧洲唯一的向其他国家提出领土要求的国家。”公报说：“双方从它们的共同安全和它们边境的不可侵犯性的要求出发，一致认为，对德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国或者华沙条约的任何其他成员国领土完整的任何攻击，都将遭到华沙条约全体国家联合的坚决反击。”
    公报说，西柏林是紧张局势的一个严重的中心。“波茨坦协定中关于防止德国军国主义和复仇主义复活的条款的遭到破坏，德意志联邦共和国所走的军国主义道路、包括用核武器和火箭武器来装备它的国防军的做法，以及联邦共和国政府的顽固执行复仇政策的作法已经使西柏林问题恶化起来。”公报指出，双方都支持苏联关于柏林问题的照会里面所阐述的建议。
    公报说，目前各国人民所主要关心的是消除核武器威胁，立即停止核武器试验，完全禁止核武器，削减常规军备和取消外国在其他国家领土上的军事基地。在这个问题上取得进展，是转向缓和国际局势的基本的必要条件。双方都完全支持苏联的关于举行最高级会议的倡议。
    公报说，关于波兰的在中欧设立一个无原子武器地区的倡议，只有那些不愿意缓和国际局势以及把西德军队的原子武装作为他们政治概念基础的人才会对这个建议进行根本的阻挠。他们这种概念是目前欧洲和平的主要威胁，因此必须对它加以克服。
    公报强调指出，双方决不放松它们的为争取集体安全、争取社会制度不同的国家和平共处的原则的胜利而进行的斗争。为了实现和平共处，两国将进一步努力扩大它们同其他国家的经济、文化和其他方面的联系，这种联系不为社会制度的不同所影响。
    公报说，德国统一社会党和波兰统一工人党两党代表团在两国的社会主义建设问题方面、在两党的工作方面、在两党的关系方面、以及国际工人运动的当前的重要问题方面广泛地交换了意见。
    两党一致认为：“同修正主义进行毫不妥协的斗争是成功地进行社会主义建设的一个必要的先决条件。”双方认为，同教条主义的症象进行斗争是必要的。德国统一社会党和波兰统一工人党两党的代表们保证忠于无产阶级国际主义以及各兄弟党根据各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科宣言中所奠定的原则的精神进行合作。公报又说：“社会主义阵营各国的团结一致、首要的社会主义国家苏联以及中华人民共和国和所有其他社会主义国家的强大对于保护它们的建设、维护和平和巩固世界上一切和平力量具有决定性的意义。”
    两党宣布，它们将进一步加强同所有共产党和工人党的合作与兄弟联系。为了增进德国统一社会党和波兰统一工人党之间的兄弟关系，将要互派更多的党代表团，并且预定还要共同参加重要的理论性会议。
    公报最后说，民主德国和波兰之间的合作和友好是欧洲和平与安全的一个重要因素。双方决心进一步加强这种友好关系。
