How to Improve the Quality of Indigenous Iron and Steelmaking?
    Xu Caidong

    Currently, converter steelmaking primarily uses indigenous iron. Indigenous iron is of poor quality, with the shortcomings of being "three lows and one high." The "three lows" refer to low carbon, low silicon, and low manganese content, while "one high" refers to high sulfur content. How to transform this indigenous iron, with its "three lows and one high," into good steel in small converters is a new technology in the metallurgical industry. This problem has not been encountered domestically or internationally in the past. Now that we are facing it, we are required to solve it quickly.

    The Key to Quality

    The current problems with converter steelmaking are: insufficient iron melt temperature, difficulty in supplying ferrosilicon, steel ingot sizes not meeting specifications, and chemical composition not meeting requirements. Among these, the main issue is chemical composition, and among the various chemical components, the most serious threat to steel quality and impact on successful steel rolling is the sulfur content. Sulfur has a strong chemical affinity with iron, forming iron sulfide compounds in the steel. This compound forms a low-melting-point eutectic within the steel's internal structure, melting into a liquid below 1000°C. This causes cracks to occur in the rolled steel.

    So, where does the sulfur in the steel come from? There are two sources: one is from the indigenous iron, and the other is from the coke used during iron smelting. The iron produced using bituminous coal and coke in various regions generally has a high sulfur content, usually varying within the range of 0.15% to 0.6%, and sometimes reaching 1%. Iron produced with charcoal generally has a lower sulfur content. As for some charcoal-produced pig iron with a high sulfur content, this is because pyrite was added to the blast furnace during ore selection.

    Starting from Raw Materials

    It is clear that to improve the quality of steel, we must first fight against sulfur. To reduce the sulfur content of indigenous iron, we must start with raw materials. On the basis of combining indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously transform existing indigenous blast furnaces, adopting mechanical and hydraulic blowing to increase air volume and raise air pressure; change cold air to hot air to increase the smelting temperature, especially increasing the hearth temperature, so as to increase the carbon, silicon, and manganese content of pig iron and reduce the sulfur content; strengthen coal washing, coal selection, coke calcination, ore selection, and ore calcination to minimize or eliminate the source of sulfur; infiltrate limestone and mix it into alkaline slag, and desulfurize in and out of the furnace to transfer the sulfur into the slag. By taking these measures, indigenous iron will undergo qualitative changes and transform from "three lows and one high" to "three highs and one low." Indigenous iron will be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with foreign iron, producing good steel in small converters and rolling out steel products that meet specifications.

    The coke used for iron smelting should undergo coal selection and washing before coking. The sulfur in coal usually exists in three states: organic sulfur, sulfate nodule sulfur, and pyrite sulfur. Organic sulfur is not easily decomposed in a reducing atmosphere and completely enters the coke during the coking process. Approximately 30% to 40% of sulfate nodule sulfur and pyrite sulfur decompose into gas and escape during the coking process, with the remaining 60% to 70% transferring into the coke. Generally, coal mines contain more pyrite. Coal washing should be strengthened, and the property that pyrite is heavier than coal can be used to separate pyrite and some sulfate nodules by slurry coal washing, manual coal selection, or using wooden jigs. In some places, bituminous coal is of very good quality, low in sulfur, strong in firepower, and cheap. Consider using bituminous coal to replace coke for iron smelting.

    Desulfurization during Iron Smelting

    According to local experiences, desulfurization can be carried out during iron smelting, and the desulfurization efficiency is very high.

    One method for desulfurization during iron smelting is to use a larger slag volume. Under certain alkalinity and temperature, the ratio of sulfur content in the slag and pig iron is fixed. This is the natural law of sulfur distribution according to concentration in two different liquids. Therefore, the greater the slag volume during iron smelting, the more total sulfur in the slag, and the higher the desulfurization efficiency. Limestone, dolomite, fluorite, and sandstone can be used for slag making. The slag-iron ratio can vary within the range of 1:4 to 1:7.

    The second method is to use high-alkalinity slag. According to years of research on blast furnace ironmaking, the sulfur content of various slag compositions largely depends on the alkalinity of the slag, which is the weight ratio of calcium oxide to silicon dioxide in the slag. Within a certain range, the larger this ratio, the higher the sulfur content of the slag. Acidic slag with an alkalinity of less than 1 has a very small sulfur content, usually below 0.45%. When the alkalinity exceeds 1.2, the sulfur content of the slag increases sharply. Slag with an alkalinity of 1.5–1.6 generally has a sulfur content of about 1.5%, and the highest can reach 2%.

    To create alkaline slag, more limestone can be added. The amount of limestone used can be equal to the amount of coke, and if necessary, it can even exceed the amount of coke. In order to improve the fluidity of the slag, dolomite and fluorite can be infiltrated into the mixture. The amount of dolomite should be such that the magnesium oxide content in the slag reaches 5%–8%. The amount of fluorite added is 5%–10% of the weight of the limestone.

    The third method for desulfurization during iron smelting is to use hot air. Hot air can increase the furnace temperature. In addition to alkalinity, the desulfurization ability of the slag is also related to temperature. Increasing the temperature can increase the fluidity of the slag, promote the diffusion ability of sulfur from high concentration to low concentration, and increase the desulfurization rate of the slag. In addition, high-alkalinity slag has a very high melting point, and it can only be melted after using hot air.

    Using hot air can also increase the temperature of the molten iron. Using 50°C hot air can raise the molten iron temperature by 20°C. Using 150°C hot air can raise the molten iron temperature by 50°C. Using hot air above 300°C can raise the molten iron temperature by more than 100°C. The molten iron temperature at the outlet can reach 1450°–1500°C. Because the molten iron temperature is very high, freezing accidents during blowing can be completely avoided. There is also no need to add ferrosilicon during the blowing process, saving a large amount of ferrosilicon alloy. Using high-temperature molten iron for blowing can also improve the utilization efficiency of air, shorten the blowing time, and relatively increase the steelmaking rate, thereby reducing the sulfur content in the molten steel.

    The fourth method for desulfurization during iron smelting is to switch to alkaline furnace lining, such as using dolomite as a refractory material, with performance not inferior to magnesite.

    Desulfurization during Steelmaking

    Desulfurization can also be carried out during steelmaking, and the desulfurization efficiency can reach up to 75%. Molten iron with a sulfur content of 0.25% can be blown to obtain steel ingots with a sulfur content of less than 0.1%.

    The desulfurization method for steelmaking is to use alkaline furnace lining and alkaline slag. The masonry method of alkaline furnace lining is similar to that of alkaline iron smelting furnaces. Special attention should be paid when building the tuyere, because the life of the tuyere largely determines the life of the entire furnace lining. The tuyere is best tamped individually with a brick mold.

    There are three methods of slag making: single slag, double slag, and slag retention. The single slag method is to add slag-making materials at one time at the beginning of blowing and continue blowing until the end. The double slag method is to add some slag-making materials at the beginning of blowing, remove the acidic slag at the end of the first blowing stage, and then add the second batch of slag-making materials and continue blowing to the end. The slag retention method is to leave as much steel slag from the previous furnace blowing as possible in the furnace for desulfurization during the second furnace blowing.

    The desulfurization and dephosphorization efficiency of the double slag method is higher than that of the single slag method, but heat is lost during slag removal. Small furnaces have small heat capacity. In order to prevent freezing accidents of molten steel, it is best to use the single slag method for operation. The slag retention method is effective, and the more slag retained, the greater the desulfurization efficiency. When using the slag retention method, the steel outlet should not be too large, otherwise the slag will not be easily retained in the furnace.

    The raw materials for slag making are lime and fluorite. The amount of lime used varies within the range of 2%–5%. If the furnace capacity is large and the molten iron temperature is high, more lime can be added. If the furnace capacity is small and the molten iron temperature is low, the amount of lime should be greatly reduced, otherwise the slag will not be dissolved, and the furnace may not even be able to be blown. When using the double slag method, add one-third of the total amount of lime for the first time, and add the remainder after slag removal. The amount of fluorite used is about 0.5%–1.0% of the weight of the molten iron.

    Rolling Good Steel from High-Sulfur Steel

    When the sulfur content of steel ingots is greater than 0.12%, the rolled steel will crack when using general steel rolling methods. When the sulfur content of steel ingots is greater than 0.3%, the rolled steel will break into several small pieces, and may even become like tofu dregs. The reason why steel cracks and breaks is caused by iron sulfide. Iron sulfide has a very low melting point, only 1193°C. The eutectic composed of iron sulfide and iron has an even lower melting point, melting at around 980°C. These eutectics become the weak part of the steel at high temperatures. Once rolled, they will crack.

    If the heating temperature of the steel ingot is reduced and the heating time is prolonged to make the steel ingot evenly heated inside and out, then steel ingots with a higher sulfur content can also be rolled into good steel. Tianjin Steel Plant has already rolled steel ingots with a sulfur content as high as three per thousand (0.3%) into good steel, with a yield rate of over 90%. The steel surface is good, and the mechanical properties are also fully qualified.

    怎样提高土铁炼钢的质量？
    徐采栋
    目前转炉炼钢，吃的主要是土铁，土铁质量差，有三低一高的缺点，三低是炭低、矽低、锰低，一高是含硫高。怎样把三低一高的土铁在小转炉中炼成好钢，这是冶金工业上的一项新技术，过去这个问题在国内国外都没有遇到过，现在碰上了，要求我们迅速解决。
    质量的关键所在
    转炉炼钢目前存在的问题是：铁水温度不高，矽铁供应困难，钢锭尺寸不合规格，化学成份不合要求。其中主要的是化学成份问题。在各种化学成份中，严重威胁钢的质量、影响轧钢成败的又是含硫问题。硫与铁的化学亲和力很大，在钢中形成硫化铁化合物，这个化合物在钢的内部组织中组成一种熔点很低的共熔体，在1000℃以下就会熔化成液体，因而使轧出的钢材发生裂纹。
    那么，钢里面的硫是从哪儿来的呢？来源有二：一是来自土铁，一是来自化铁时用的焦炭。各地用白煤和焦炭炼出的铁一般含硫量较高。通常在0.15％—0.6％范围内变动，有时可以达到1％。用木炭炼出的铁，一般含硫较低。至于有些用木炭炼出来的生铁含硫量偏高，这是由于选矿时把黄铁矿也加进了高炉的原故。
    从原料着手
    很明显，要提高钢的质量，首先要和硫作斗争。要减少土铁的含硫量，就要从原料入手。在土洋结合的基础上，大力改造现有土高炉，采用机械和水力鼓风，使风量增大，风压提高；改冷风为热风，提高熔炼温度，特别是提高炉缸温度，使生铁中的含炭、含矽、含锰量增加，含硫量下降；加强洗煤，选煤，煅煤，选矿，煅矿工作，尽可能的减少或杜绝硫的来路；渗用石灰石，配成碱性渣，在炉内和炉外进行脱硫，使硫移入炉渣。采取了这些措施，土铁就会发生质的变化，就能变三低一高为三高一低。土铁就能和洋铁平起平坐，在小转炉中炼出好钢，轧出合乎规格的钢材来。
    化铁用的焦炭，在炼焦前要进行选煤洗煤工作。煤中的硫，通常以有机硫、硫酸块硫及黄铁矿硫三种状态存在，有机硫在还原气氛中不易分解，炼焦过程全部转入焦炭，硫酸块硫与黄铁矿硫在炼焦过程中大约有30％—40％分解成气体跑掉，其余60％—70％转入焦炭。一般煤矿中含黄铁矿较多，应当加强洗煤工作，利用黄铁矿比煤重这一性质，可以采取泥浆选煤、手选煤或用木制跳汰机来分离黄铁矿和部分硫酸块。有些地方白煤质量很好，含硫低，火力强，价格便宜，可以考虑用白煤代替焦炭化铁。
    化铁时脱硫
    根据各地经验，化铁时可以脱硫，而且脱硫效率很高。
    化铁脱硫办法之一是采用较大的渣量。在一定的碱度和温度下，硫在炉渣中和生铁中的含量有着固定不变的比例，这是硫在两种不同的液体中依照浓度所分配的自然规律。所以化铁时渣量越大，渣中总硫量就越多，脱硫效率也就越高，可以用石灰石、白云石、莹石和砂石进行造渣，渣铁比可以在1∶4到1∶7的范围内变动。
    办法之二是采用高碱度渣，根据高炉炼铁的多年研究，各种不同成份炉渣的含硫量，在很大程度上决定于炉渣的碱度，就是炉渣中氧化钙与二氧化矽含量的重量比值。在一定范围内，这个比值越大，炉渣的含硫量就越高。碱度小于1的酸性渣，含硫量很小，通常在0.45％以下；碱度超过1.2时，炉渣的含硫量急剧升高；碱度为1.5—1.6的炉渣，一般含硫量为1.5％左右，最高的可以达到2％。
    造成碱性渣，可以多配石灰石，石灰石的用量可以等于焦炭的用量，必要时还可以超过焦炭的用量。为了提高炉渣的流动性，可以在配料中渗用白云石和莹石，白云石的用量以炉渣中的氧化镁含量达到5％—8％为宜，莹石的加入量为石灰石重量的5％—10％。
    化铁脱硫办法之三是采用热风。热风可以提高炉温，炉渣的脱硫能力，除了决定于碱度以外，还与温度有关，提高温度可以增加炉渣的流动性，促进硫自高浓度移向低浓度的扩散能力，加大炉渣的脱硫速度。此外高碱度炉渣的熔点很高，采用热风后才能使之熔化。
    采用热风还可以提高铁水温度。采用50℃的热风，铁水温度可以升高20℃，采用150℃的热风，铁水温度可以升高50℃，采用300℃以上的热风，铁水温度可以升高100℃以上，出炉铁水温度可以达到1450°—1500℃，由于铁水温度很高，吹炼冻结事故能够完全避免。吹炼过程也无须加入矽铁，节省了大量的矽铁合金，用高温铁水吹炼，还能够提高空气的利用效率，缩短吹炼时间，相对的提高了成钢率，因而降低了钢水中的含硫量。
    化铁脱硫办法之四是改用碱性炉衬，如白云石等作耐火材料，使用效能不在镁砂之下。
    炼钢时脱硫
    炼钢时也可以脱硫，脱硫效率最高可以达到75％，含硫0.25％的铁水，吹炼后可以得到含硫小于0.1％的钢锭。
    炼钢的脱硫办法是采用碱性炉衬和配用碱性炉渣。碱性炉衬的砌筑方法与碱性化铁炉相似，在筑捣风眼时要特别注意，因为风眼的寿命在很大程度上决定了整个炉衬的寿命，风眼最好单独用砖模捣结。
    造渣的方法有单渣、双渣和留渣法三种，单渣法是在吹炼开始时，一次加入造渣材料，一直吹炼到终点为止。双渣法是在吹炼开始时加入部分造渣材料，吹炼第一期末扒去酸性渣，再加入第二次造渣材料，再吹炼到终点。留渣法是把上炉吹炼的钢渣尽可能的留在炉内，供第二炉吹钢时脱硫之用。
    双渣法的脱硫脱磷效率较单渣法为高，但是扒渣时要损失一部分热量，小炉子热容量小，为了防止发生钢水冻结事故，最好还是采用单渣法操作。留渣法收效显著，而且留渣量越多，脱硫效率就越大。采用留渣法时，出钢口不能过大，否则渣子就不容易留在炉中。
    造渣的原料为石灰及莹石，石灰的配用量在2％—5％的范围内变动，炉子容量大，铁水温度高，石灰可以多加些；炉子容量小，铁水温度低，石灰用量就要大加压缩，否则渣子化不了，甚至还会使炉子吹不起来。采用双渣法时，第一次加入石灰总量的三分之一，余下的在扒渣后加入。莹石的用量约为铁水重量的0.5％—1.0％。
    用高硫钢轧成好钢材
    钢锭含硫量大于0.12％时，用一般的方法轧钢，轧出的钢材会发生裂纹。钢锭含硫大于0.3％时，轧出的钢材会碎裂成若干小块，甚至会变得像豆腐渣一样。钢材发裂和碎裂的原因是由硫化铁引起的，硫化铁的熔点很低，只有1193℃，由硫化铁与铁所组成的共熔体，熔点更低，在980℃左右就会熔化，这些共熔体在高温时成为钢材中的薄弱部分，一经压轧，便会裂开。
    如果降低钢锭加热温度，延长加热时间，使钢锭内外受热均匀，那么含硫较高的钢锭也可以轧成好的钢材。天津钢厂已经把含硫量高达千分之三（0.3％）的钢锭轧成了好钢材，成材率达到90％以上。钢材表面良好，机械性能也完全合格。
