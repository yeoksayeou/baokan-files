　　Fight Well the Commercial Transportation Assault Battle
　　The Ministry of Railways is preparing, in the near future, to conduct a special transportation operation for the commercial sector while ensuring the completion of the "Marshal" material transportation tasks, in order to appropriately address the current supply issues of urgently needed goods in the market. For this purpose, the State Economic Commission and the Fifth Office of the State Council have jointly issued a notice, requiring all localities to mobilize all forces to concentrate materials at the stations while completing their original transportation tasks. This is a transportation assault battle concerning the lives of the people nationwide, and it must be fought well.
　　In order to concentrate efforts on transporting materials necessary for steel production, some market-demanded goods and agricultural product transfer tasks were recently squeezed out. This is entirely understandable. However, this situation can only be temporary, because the steelmaking furnaces need to be fed, the market needs to be fed, agricultural products cannot always be scattered in the countryside, and industrial products are also urgently needed in the countryside. Therefore, while ensuring the "Marshal" material transportation tasks, appropriately squeezing out some transportation capacity and exploring some transportation potential in various ways to carry out a special transportation for the commercial sector is entirely necessary for urban and rural material exchange, meeting the needs of all aspects of production, and the needs of urban and rural people's lives.
　　Is it feasible to both ensure the "Marshal" material transportation tasks and squeeze out forces to carry out a special transportation for the commercial sector? It is entirely feasible at present. In terms of trunk line transportation, the Shanghai Railway Bureau provides us with an experience: using the steel "Marshal" trains to carry non-staple foods into the city. They found that although the steel "Marshal" materials such as pig iron, coal, and ore are very heavy, their volume is relatively small, and there is still remaining volume on the vehicles after loading, which can be used to load non-staple foods together into the city. Just imagine: if all the steel "Marshal" trains across the country did this, how much of a problem could be solved.
　　Of course, it is not enough to just squeeze out forces from the trunk line transportation tools. There is still a phenomenon of vehicles waiting for goods on many lines now, which is a great waste. If the phenomenon of vehicles waiting for goods is changed to goods waiting for vehicles, a great potential can be tapped. This requires all localities to organize forces in advance and concentrate the materials scattered in various places at the stations as soon as possible. In this regard, folk transportation tools are an indispensable force. Organizing the folk transportation forces well will not be difficult to increase transportation capacity. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is an example.
　　The commercial assault movement will begin around December 10th. I hope that all localities will act quickly and fight this battle well!

### 打好商业运输突击战

    打好商业运输突击战
    铁道部准备在最近一个时期，在保证完成“元帅”物资运输任务的情况下，为商业部门进行一次突击运输，适当解决当前市场急需物资的供应问题。国家经济委员会和国务院第五办公室为此已联合发出通知，要求各地在完成原定运输任务的同时，动员各种力量做好把物资向车站集中的工作。这是一场关系着全国人民生活的运输突击战，必须打好。
    为了集中力量运输钢铁生产必需的物资，最近一个时期曾挤掉一些市场急需物资和农产品调运任务。这是完全可以理解的。但是，这种状况毕竟只能是短期的，因为炼钢炉要吃饱，市场也要吃饱，农产品不能总是散在农村，工业品同样急待下乡。因此，在保证“元帅”物资运输任务的情况下，适当挤出一部分运输力量，多方挖掘一些运输潜力，为商业部门进行一次突击运输，这对于城乡物资交流，满足各方面生产和城乡人民生活需要，都是完全必要的。
    既保证“元帅”物资运输任务，又挤出力量来为商业部门进行一次突击运输行不行呢？目前是完全可行的。干线运输方面，上海铁路局为我们提供了一条经验：利用钢帅列车携带副食品进城。他们发现生铁、煤炭、矿石等钢帅物资虽然份量很重，但体积比较小，车辆装载后上面还有剩余的容积，可以加载副食品一同进城。试想：如果全国的钢帅列车都这么做，可以解决多大的问题。
    当然，光是干线交通工具挤出力量还是不够的。现在不少线路上还有车等货的现象，这是一个很大的浪费。如果把车等货的现象变成货等车，就能挖出很大的潜力来。这就需要各地事先组织力量，把分散在各处的物资尽先集中到车站上来。在这方面，民间运输工具是一支不可忽视的力量，把民间运输力量组织好，也不难增加运力。延边朝鲜族自治州就是一例。
    商业突击运动将在12月10日左右开始。希望各地赶快行动起来，打好这一仗！
