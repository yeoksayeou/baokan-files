    Song of the Lumberjack
    Lumberjack  Liu Yongzhu
    I am a lumberjack,
    Showing my skill in the primeval forest,
    With a new chainsaw on my back,
    And a great axe in my hand.
    The chainsaw roars,
    Scaring the old beasts that have been around for years,
    The mountain god is frightened and has nowhere to hide,
    The tiger is scared and disappears without a trace.
    I am a lumberjack,
    Guarding the Xing'an Mountains day and night,
    No matter how cold the wind and snow,
    My revolutionary zeal is like a blazing fire.
    I enter the mountains just as dawn breaks,
    And descend with the moon and stars as my cloak,
    I work day and night without tiring,
    For a beautiful future.

    伐木人之歌
    伐木工人  刘永柱我是一个伐木工，原始林内显神通，身背一台新油锯，开山大斧拿手中。油锯发出隆隆声，吓坏了多年老兽精，山神吓的无处躲，猛虎吓的无影踪。我是一个伐木工，日夜镇守兴安岭，不管风雪有多冷，革命干劲似火红。天刚黎明进山林，下山披着月和星，日夜劳动不知累，为了美好的远景。
