Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 25th. The enterprises under the Bulgarian Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry have completed this year's annual plan nine days ahead of schedule on the 22nd. It is expected that by the end of the year, the production will exceed the plan by more than 200 million leva (Bulgarian currency).

The completion of the plan by heavy industry is outstanding. All forty heavy industrial enterprises in the country completed this year's production plan one to two months ahead of schedule. In the coal mining industry, Bulgarian miners have overfulfilled this year's coal mining plan by 500,000 tons due to the use of advanced Soviet methods and improved mining technology. The Lenin Metallurgical Plant also overfulfilled its annual plan, producing several thousand tons more of iron, steel, and steel products.

Bulgarian light industrial factories have now produced 900 million leva more worth of cotton fabrics, wool fabrics, silk fabrics, boots, shoes, and other light industrial products than last year. (Attached picture)

    保工业提前完成年度计划
    新华社索非亚25日电  保加利亚重工业部和轻工业部所属各企业已经提前九天在22日完成了今年年度计划，预计到年底将超过计划多生产价值两亿列弗（保币名）的产品。
    重工业完成计划的情况很出色。全国四十个重工业企业都提前一个月至两个月完成了今年的生产计划。采煤工业中，保加利亚矿工们由于运用了苏联的先进方法和改进采掘技术，超额五十万吨完成了今年的采煤计划。列宁冶金工厂也超额完成了年度计划，多生产了几千吨铁、钢和钢材。
