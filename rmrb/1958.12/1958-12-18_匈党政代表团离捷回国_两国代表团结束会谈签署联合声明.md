    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th - The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation left Prague this morning for home. Czechoslovak Communist and state leaders Novotny, Široký, and others saw them off at the station.
    Czechoslovak Premier Široký delivered a farewell speech at the station, saying that the close ties between Czechoslovakia and Hungary are built on the principles of proletarian internationalism. The joint statement of the two countries' party and government delegations is another warning to West German militarists and other imperialist conspirators.
    Hungarian Prime Minister Münnich emphasized in his reply that the results of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation's visit to Czechoslovakia will surely help strengthen the socialist and peace camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th - After the talks, the Czechoslovak and Hungarian Party and Government Delegations signed a joint statement here this afternoon.
    Signing the joint statement on behalf of Czechoslovakia were Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Republic, and Široký, Premier of the Republic. Signing on behalf of Hungary were Münnich, Premier of the Hungarian People's Republic and Member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, and Marosán, Member of the Political Bureau.
