Moscow, November 30th (by this newspaper's correspondent) - Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Mitin published an article in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" entitled "Steps Towards Our Tomorrow," discussing the mass movement of striving to become Communist Labor Brigades that is currently flourishing throughout the Soviet Union. He said that the widespread establishment of Communist Labor Brigades across the country is, it can be said, the dawn of a new patriotic movement. The creativity of the masses is limitless, and the practice of communist construction produces new things every day. Any new thing, as long as it promotes our progress, will certainly receive the support of the broad masses and can be widely developed. This is precisely the case now. The new slogan "Work, study, and live in the spirit of communism," which was born at the Moscow Sorting Station, quickly spread throughout the country. If the Communist Subbotniks, called a great initiative by Lenin before 1939, were a historical turning point (the capitalist legacy of attitudes towards labor began to be defeated), then in today's Communist Labor Brigades, we can see the face of people in a communist society taking shape. He said that the current movement of universally establishing Communist Labor Brigades is undoubtedly a continuation and development of that great initiative.

Mitin concluded by writing that Lenin's prediction of communist labor is being realized today, the triumph of communist labor has arrived, and the movement to establish Communist Labor Brigades is a new step in promoting this triumph.

    米丁著文赞扬苏联人民爱国创举
    认为共产主义的人的面貌在形成
    本报莫斯科30日电  苏联科学院院士米丁在“共青真理报”上发表题为“走向我们明天的步伐”一文，论述目前正在苏联全国蓬勃发展的争取做共产主义劳动工作队的群众运动。他说，全国各地共产主义劳动工作队普遍建立这一事实，可以说是一个新的爱国主义运动的曙光。人民群众的创造力是不可限量的，共产主义建设的实践每天都在产生新的东西，而任何新的东西只要它能促进我们前进，必定会受到广大群众的支持，而且能够广泛展开。现在的情况正是这样。“用共产主义的精神来工作、学习和生活”这句诞生在莫斯科调车站的新口号，很快地飞遍了全国。如果说1939年前被列宁称为伟大的创举的共产主义星期六义务劳动是一个历史的转折点（资本主义留给人们的对劳动的态度开始被打败），那么在今天的共产主义劳动工作队中间，我们便可以看到共产主义社会的人的面貌正在形成。他说，目前普遍建立共产主义劳动工作队的运动，无疑是伟大创举的继续与发展。
    米丁最后写道，列宁当年对共产主义劳动的预言今天正在实现，共产主义劳动凯旋的时候已经到来，建立共产主义劳动的工作队的运动是促进这一凯旋的新步骤。
