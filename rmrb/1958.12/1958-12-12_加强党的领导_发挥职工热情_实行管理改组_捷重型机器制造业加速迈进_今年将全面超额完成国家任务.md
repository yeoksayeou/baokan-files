    Strengthen Party Leadership, Unleash Worker Enthusiasm, Implement Management Reorganization
    Czechoslovak Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Accelerates Progress
    Will Comprehensively Overfulfill National Tasks This Year
    (Our Dispatch from Prague, December 11) Our correspondent Yang Yi reports: Czechoslovak heavy machinery manufacturing will overfulfill the state-stipulated production tasks this year, increasing production by 750 million crowns (Czechoslovak currency) compared to the original plan. This year is characterized by: not only fulfilling the output value plan, but also achieving quality indicators, reducing production costs, and increasing labor productivity. In general, the production tasks have been completed in a balanced manner. This was emphasized by Comrade J. Reitmayer, Minister of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing of Czechoslovakia, when he received our reporter a few days ago.
    When talking about the reasons for the achievements, Reitmayer emphasized the leading role of the Party. This year, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has strengthened its work in all levels of organization and in all tasks, playing the role of a fighting headquarters. Under the leadership of the Party, the Ministry of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing has greatly unleashed the political enthusiasm of the workers and significantly improved the management of production.
    Reitmayer reviewed the various measures taken by the Czechoslovak Communist Party in the past year to mobilize the working people to widely participate in production leadership and management, citing examples to illustrate that the masses of workers not only fully support the policies and tasks formulated by the Party, enthusiastically put forward guarantees to complete the tasks, but also more than once actively raised the original production targets. For example, in the recent general survey of national economic effects, after discussion, the employees of the heavy machinery manufacturing sector increased the production tasks for next year by 800 million crowns.
    When talking about the industrial management reorganization implemented in April this year, Reitmayer excitedly said, "This was the right thing to do." Because this reorganization cut redundant institutions, streamlined surplus personnel, improved the quality of cadres, and strengthened work efficiency, its superiority has been demonstrated in the production achievements in the second half of the year. It is expected that its effectiveness will be further enhanced next year when the national economic plan and financial reorganization are implemented.
    Heavy machinery manufacturing is the heart of Czechoslovak industry. It not only occupies a particularly important position in Czechoslovakia's basic construction, industrial production, and foreign trade, but also bears the responsibility of providing machinery and equipment for the entire socialist camp. Due to domestic and foreign needs, its development in the ten years after the war has exceeded the hundred years before the war. In the future, it will continue to move forward at a rapid pace. Comrade Reitmayer told reporters that the production of his department will increase by another 11.8% next year compared to this year, and labor productivity will increase by 10.2%. By 1965, heavy machinery manufacturing will increase by 170% compared to 1957, reaching nine times that of the pre-war year of 1937.
    When answering reporters' questions about the long-term plan for Czechoslovakia's heavy machinery manufacturing industry, Reitmayer especially emphasized the importance of professional division of labor and long-term trade agreements among countries in the socialist camp. He pointed out that for the needs of the common rise of the socialist economy of various countries, the long-established Czechoslovak machinery manufacturing industry will vigorously carry out reconstruction, replace equipment, and achieve full or semi-automation in many industrial sectors.
    Comrade Reitmayer finally said with a smile that China is his biggest customer this year, and the products supplied to China the most are power plants, train power stations, chemical and mining equipment, etc. He visited China in 1955 and also visited the Chinese Pavilion at this year's International Expo, so he has a complete understanding and deep feelings for the construction achievements of New China. He praised the drive and enthusiasm of Chinese workers and believes that the machines exhibited by China at the Damascus exhibition this year are first-class in the world and are very suitable for the needs of Asian and African countries. When saying goodbye, he also enthusiastically told reporters that he believes that China can quickly catch up with Britain.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Prague) Czechoslovak coal industry has exceeded this year's plan by about three million tons of coal, thus basically meeting the needs of this year's national economic development, changing the past situation of relying on imports for some coal.
    Since the beginning of this year, new atmospheres have continued to appear in the production of Czechoslovakia's coal industry. In the first three quarters, a total of 62.97 million tons of coal were produced, an increase of 11.3% over the same period last year. Many mining areas have now completed and overfulfilled their increased production guarantees put forward to welcome the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution, and have continuously refreshed their production records. Miners in the country's largest Ostrava-Karvina coal district once created a historical record of 78,620 tons of daily production on November 27, which was more than 6,000 tons of coal more than the original plan.

### 加强党的领导  发挥职工热情  实行管理改组  捷重型机器制造业加速迈进  今年将全面超额完成国家任务

    加强党的领导  发挥职工热情  实行管理改组
    捷重型机器制造业加速迈进
    今年将全面超额完成国家任务
    本报布拉格11日电  本报记者杨翊报道，捷克斯洛伐克重型机器制造业今年将超额完成国家规定的生产任务，比原计划增产七亿五千万克朗（捷币）。今年的特点是：它不仅完成了产值计划，而且实现了质量指标，降低了生产成本，提高了劳动生产率。总的说就是均衡地完成了生产任务。这是捷克斯洛伐克重型机器制造部长约·雷特马耶尔同志日前接见本报记者时强调指出的。
    在谈到取得成就的原因时，雷特马耶尔着重提到党的领导作用。今年捷共在各级组织和各项工作中都加强了自己的工作，起到了战斗司令部的作用。在党的领导下，重型机器制造部大大发挥了职工的政治积极性，并显著地改善了生产的管理。
    雷特马耶尔回溯了一年来捷共动员劳动人民广泛参与生产领导和管理的各项措施，举例说明工人群众不仅完全拥护党制定的政策和任务，热烈提出完成任务的保证，而且还不只一次地主动提高原有生产指标。例如在不久前举行的国民经济效果普查中，重型机器制造部门的职工讨论后把明年的生产任务增加了八亿克朗。
    当谈到今年4月实行的工业管理改组时，雷特马耶尔兴奋地说“这事做得很对。”因为这次改组裁撤了重叠的机构，精简了多余的人员，提高了干部质量，加强了工作效率，它的优越性已在下半年的生产成就中显示出来。预计明年当国民经济计划和财务改组实施后，还将进一步发挥它的功效。
    重型机器制造是捷克斯洛伐克工业的心脏，它不仅在捷克斯洛伐克基本建设、工业生产和对外贸易中占有特殊重要的地位，而且还肩负着为整个社会主义阵营提供机器设备的责任。由于国内外的需要，它在战后十年的发展超过了战前的一百年。今后它仍将以快速的步伐向前迈进。雷特马耶尔同志对记者说，他所属部门的生产明年将比今年再提高11.8％，劳动生产率要增长10.2％。而到1965年时，重型机器制造业要比1957年提高170％，达到战前1937年的九倍。
    在回答记者关于捷克斯洛伐克重型机器制造业远景规划的问题时，雷特马耶尔特别强调社会主义阵营各国间专业分工和长期贸易协定的重要意义。他指出，为了各国社会主义经济共同高涨的需要，历史悠久的捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业将大力进行重建，更换设备，在许多工业部门实现全部自动化或半自动化。
    雷特马耶尔同志最后笑着说，中国是他今年最大的主顾，供应中国最多的产品是发电厂、列车电站、化工和矿井设备等。他曾在1955年访问过中国，也在今年国际博览会上参观过中国馆，因此他对新中国的建设成就有着完整的了解和深厚的感情。他赞扬中国工人的干劲和热情，并认为中国今年在大马士革展出的机器是世界上第一流的，很适合亚非国家的需要。在告别时他还热情地对记者说，他相信中国能迅速赶上英国。
    据新华社布拉格电  捷克斯洛伐克煤炭工业已经超过今年计划生产了约三百万吨煤，从而基本上满足了今年国民经济发展的需要，改变了过去部分煤炭依赖进口的状况。
    从今年年初以来，捷克斯洛伐克煤炭工业的生产不断出现新的气象。在前三季度中总共生产了六千二百九十七万吨煤，比去年同期增加了11.3％。许多矿区现在都已经完成和超额完成了它们为迎接捷共第十一次代表大会和十月革命四十一周年而提出的增产保证，并且不断刷新了它们的生产纪录。全国最大的俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那煤区的矿工在11月27日这天曾经创造了日产七万八千六百二十吨的历史上最高纪录，比原计划多挖了六千多吨煤。
