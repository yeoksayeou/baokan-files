    Sewing a Button
    A few days ago, I took train No. 129 from Xi'an to Pukou to go to Nanjing. When I got on the train, I accidentally scraped off two buttons on my clothes. My attire was untidy and really unsightly. At this time, a female train attendant, representing the train service team, came to our carriage and said to everyone: "Comrades, if anyone has a headache or stomachache, we have emergency medicines, which are provided free of charge; if you want to write a letter, we sell envelopes, stationery and stamps, and will send them out for you at any time; if any passenger's clothes are torn, we have needles and thread to mend them for you; and..."
    Hearing the train attendant say that they had needles and thread, I stood up and said to her, "Comrade, please lend me the needle and thread, I want to sew on some buttons." As soon as I finished speaking, she took my clothes and buttons and offered to sew them for me. I declined repeatedly, but she still sat down, took out the needle and thread, and chatted with me while sewing. Before long, she had finished sewing. I took the clothes and shook her hand tightly, feeling deeply moved. I immediately felt how happy it is to live in our society!

    缝钮扣
    前几天，我乘坐由西安开往浦口的一二九次列车去南京，上车时不小心，刮掉了两个衣服扣子，衣装不整，真不雅观。这时，一位女列车员同志代表列车服务组来到我们车厢对大家说：“同志们，谁头疼肚子疼，我们有救急药品，免费供应；要想写信的，我们代售信封、信纸和邮票，并随时替你寄出；还有那位旅客衣服破了，我们有针线替你缝补；还有……。”
    听这位列车员同志说他们有针线，我就站起来对她说：“同志，请把针线借用一下，我缝缝扣子。”我的话刚说完，她就把衣服和扣子抢过去要替我缝。我一再谢绝，她还是坐下来拿出针线，一边缝一边和我拉起话来，不大一会就缝完了。我接过衣服，感动得紧紧地握着她的手，顿时心里感到生活在我们这个社会里，该是多么幸福啊！
