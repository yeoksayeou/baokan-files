Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 6th: The living welfare work at the Miluo River Estuary Reclamation Project site in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, is very well done. More than 30,000 laborers can basically achieve good food, good housing, good rest, good entertainment, and good hygiene.

More than 730 sheds were built on the construction site, all of which were sturdy and spacious. The vast majority of the beds were laid in three layers: a layer of bamboo strips, a layer of reeds, and then a thick layer of rice straw, one and a half feet above the ground, making them soft and warm to sleep on. The sheds all faced south, with drainage ditches dug around them. Many sheds had reed-woven windbreak doors to prevent the intrusion of cold winter winds. The canteens on the construction site used bowls for steaming rice, and the prepared dishes were placed in small earthenware jars, covered with wooden lids, or kept warm in the wooden steamers used for steaming rice, so everyone could eat steaming hot meals at every meal. Thanks to a good supply of non-staple foods, and the construction site's own vegetable growing, pig raising, and fishing, the variety of dishes became more and more diverse, with the average mess unit being able to eat two dishes and a soup or three dishes and a soup at each meal. The problem of cotton clothing has been basically solved by the laborers bringing their own from home and the communes making overall arrangements. The problem of bamboo hats, raincoats, and other rain gear has also been basically solved by each battalion organizing craftsmen to process 204 sets, purchasing 364 sets from outside, and each commune sending 413 sets from the rear.

There is a relatively complete medical network on the construction site. A construction site hospital is located at the project headquarters, medical stations are located at each of the five construction sites, and medical points are located below. Each battalion is equipped with doctors, and each company has two or three health workers. In addition to taking care of the sick, the health workers are also responsible for cleaning the inside and outside of the sheds, washing and mending clothes for the laborers, and working when they have time. In this way, the laborers do not have to worry about no one washing their clothes when they change them, and collective hygiene is also improved. The construction site hospital also has more than 50 simple hospital beds where seriously ill patients can be hospitalized.

Everywhere on the construction site, colorful flags are flying, and local broadcasts rise and fall. More than 20 theatrical troupes, with 500 actors, brought their theatrical equipment to the construction site. They also participate in labor, and during rest periods, they perform a passage of flower drum opera, Hunan opera, or storytelling. The good people and good deeds that appear on the construction site are quickly compiled into storytelling or operas and spread among the laborers.

The morale of the laborers on the construction site is full, the enthusiasm for production is high, and work efficiency is constantly improving. At the beginning of construction in early October, the average work efficiency of the entire construction site within a 320-meter haul distance was 1 to 2 cubic meters of earth per person per day, which has recently risen to 7.2 cubic meters. The Xu Shengru team of the Muluo Camp, Mubin Company, created a new record of averaging 104.4 cubic meters of earth excavation and transportation per person per day within a 750-meter haul distance.

The Miluo River Estuary Reclamation Project is a large-scale project. The entire project involves building a three-hole gate, opening a 54-li river, blocking 11 openings, and building a 115-li dike more than three zhang high, with a total earthwork volume of more than 16 million cubic meters. After the completion of this reclamation project, it can protect more than 60,000 mu of farmland from floods and waterlogging, and can expand the cultivated area by 220,000 mu.

The construction site Party committee attaches great importance to the living welfare of the laborers. It has conducted three or four careful studies and held an expanded cadre meeting of more than 300 people at the Yingtian construction site in mid-October, requiring Party organizations at all levels and all cadres to pay close attention to the living problems of the laborers and ensure that the laborers on the construction site have good food, good housing, good rest, good entertainment, and good hygiene.

### 生活福利好  干劲比天高  汨罗江尾闾围垦工地基本做到五好

    生活福利好  干劲比天高
    汨罗江尾闾围垦工地基本做到五好
    新华社长沙6日电  湖南省湘阴县汨罗江尾闾围垦工程工地生活福利事业办得很好。三万多民工基本上都能做到吃好、住好、休息好、娱乐好和卫生好。
    工地上共搭了七百三十多个工棚，都搭得很牢固和宽敞。绝大多数的床都铺了三层，一层竹一篾，一层芦柴，再铺一层厚厚的稻草，离地面一尺五寸，睡在上面既柔软又暖和。工棚都是朝南，周围挖了排水沟。不少工棚都用芦柴编了防风门，防止冬夜冷风的侵袭。工地的食堂采用钵子蒸饭，做好的菜用小瓦缸盛好、盖上木盖，或者放在蒸饭的木蒸笼里保温，大家顿顿都能吃到冒热气的饭菜。由于副食品供应得好，工地上又自己种菜、养猪、捕鱼，所以菜的花色品种越来越多，一般的伙食单位每顿就能吃到两菜一汤或三菜一汤。棉衣问题，经民工家里自带和公社统筹，已经基本上解决了。斗笠、蓑衣等各种雨具问题，由各营负责组织篾匠加工了二百零四套，从外面采购了三百六十四套，各公社从后方送来了四百一十三套，也基本上解决了。
    工地上有一个比较完整的医疗网。工程指挥部所在地设有工地医院，五个工地都设有医疗站，下面还有医疗点，各个营里都配备了医生，连里有两三个卫生员。卫生员除了照顾病号以外，还负责打扫工棚内外卫生，给民工洗衣服、补衣服，有时间还出工。这样，民工不用耽心衣服换了没人洗，集体卫生也搞好了。工地医院里还设有五十多张简易病床，重病号可以到这里住院。
    工地上，到处彩旗飘扬，土广播此起彼伏。二十多个剧团，五百多名演员，带上戏具上工地。他们也参加动劳，到休息的时候就来上一段花鼓戏、湘戏或说快板。工地上出现的好人好事，很快就被他们编成快板或戏曲，在民工中传扬开来。
    工地上民工情绪个个饱满，生产劲头十足，工作效率不断提高。在10月初开工时，全工地在三百二十公尺运距内，平均工效是每人每天运土一至二方，最近已上升到七点二方。汨罗营汨滨连许胜如小组十个人在七百五十公尺运距内，创造了每天每人平均取土运土一百零四点四方的新纪录。
    汨罗江尾闾围垦工程规模很大，整个工程要建三孔闸一座，开河五十四华里，堵口十一处，筑三丈多高的围堤一百一十五华里，全部土方工程量是一千六百多万方。这个围垦工程修成后，可使附近六万多亩农田免除水灾、渍灾，并且可以扩大耕地面积二十二万亩。
    工地党委很重视民工们的生活福利问题，曾进行过三、四次仔细研究，10月中旬还在营田工地开过三百多人的扩大干部会，要求各级党组织和全体干部密切关注民工生活问题，保证民工在工地吃好、住好、休息好、娱乐好、卫生好。
