    Let's Talk About It

    Treat Grain as Pearls
    Liao Guotai, Donghai Coal Mine, Mishan, Heilongjiang

    At midnight on December 17th, on Express Train No. 36 from Dalian to Beijing, the dining car attendants began serving dinner. One can imagine that the attendants, having been busy all day, were in a comfortable and happy mood. Therefore, they forgot their fatigue while eating, chatting and laughing excitedly. But while they were talking and laughing, the table was constantly accumulating white rice grains that fell from the diners' mouths and were pushed out of the bowls by the rice spoons. These pearl-like rice grains were wasted for nothing. The onlookers felt pain in their hearts, thinking how difficult it is to produce a single grain of rice! Logically speaking, the people eating should and could pick them up and eat them. Otherwise, how can they explain their work to the passengers?
    Grain is the most precious of treasures. Although we have had a bumper harvest this year, we must not waste it. Dining car attendants not only have the obligation to promote the importance of cherishing grain among the masses, but they themselves must also be models of cherishing grain.
    "People who respect the labor of others are people with noble moral qualities." This sentence is worthy of our deep thought.

    要把粮食当珍珠
    黑龙江密山东海采炼厂  廖国泰
    12月17日午夜，由大连开往北京的三十六次快车上，餐车的服务员开始晚餐。可以想像，服务员同志们忙碌了一天，心情是舒坦愉快的。因此用餐时也忘却了疲劳，兴奋地谈着，笑着。但发出谈笑声的同时，餐桌上不断增加着从就餐者嘴里掉下来和饭杓推出盆外的洁白的饭粒，这些像珍珠般的米粒就白白地糟蹋掉了。目击者看在眼里，痛在心上，生产一粒粮食多么不容易呀！按理说，吃饭的人是应该而且可以拾起来吃下去的，否则，怎么向旅客交代自己的工作呢？
    粮食是宝中之宝。今年我们的粮食虽然大丰收，但也浪费不得。餐车服务员不仅有义务向群众宣传爱护粮食，而自己也必须是爱护粮食的模范。
    “尊重别人劳动的人，才是有高尚道德品质的人”。这句话是值得我们深思的。
