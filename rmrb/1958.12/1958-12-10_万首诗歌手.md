Du Zonglu is an ordinary soldier on the Haihe River dam construction site. He is only nineteen years old this year and only has a junior high school education. He had never written poetry before, but he started learning to write after arriving at the construction site. But now, his poems are posted in the work sheds, his poems appear in the construction site newspapers, and the radio station often broadcasts his poems; he has become one of the famous "Ten Thousand Poems Singers" on the Haihe River dam construction site. Speaking of writing poetry, he humbly said that he only compiled some doggerel and didn’t deserve to be called poetry. Then he recited: "Soldiers dare not call themselves poets, only because good things happen every day, not writing and not singing feels awkward, so write a few to show off."

More than two months ago, this PLA soldier came to the Haihe River dam construction site with his unit. He was deeply moved when he saw how grand the engineering scale was and how magnificent the labor scene of thousands of troops was. At the same time, many soldiers picked up their pens to write poems and essays, reflecting the life and struggle on the construction site. Du Zonglu thought that he had already participated in this heroic undertaking of moving mountains and filling the sea, so he was eager to try, but he thought hard for a whole night and came up with four lines. However, the more he recited them to himself, the more he felt they were uninspired. The construction site was in full swing, but what he wrote was bland.

It was also at this time that a surge of poetry writing arose in the work sheds where the soldiers lived. Every day after work, the sheds and bunks were full of soldiers writing poems. Many good poems from the hands of soldiers also appeared in the newly opened "Poetry Garden." Du Zonglu also decided to work hard to learn to write poetry. He bound a thick notebook with Xue Lian paper and wrote four sentences on the first page: "Nail a draft notebook, put it in your pocket, whenever there is free time, just write a few lines." Now, this notebook is densely filled with as many as thousands of lines of poetry. The draft notebook and pen are kept in his pocket, during breaks and after meals; he doesn't even let go of a moment of time while crossing the ferry. In this way, "people don't leave the notebook, and the notebook doesn't leave the people," writing anytime, anywhere. In less than a month, he wrote more than a thousand long and short poems. His enthusiasm for writing became higher and higher, and he wrote: "Writing a thousand poems, thinking there are still more, pick up the Great Leap Forward pen, and write several thousand more."

At that time, the labor on the construction site was very intense, but Du Zonglu wrote a particularly large number of poems, and also wrote some better poems. For example: "The soldier races against the sun, tiring the sun to find a replacement, the moon just shows its face, and quickly says I can't replace it!"

After he had some experience in writing, he paid special attention to collecting advanced figures and events as writing materials; trying to make his poems serve the labor struggle. When transporting soil, he thought: find a "pace-setter" to praise, to encourage everyone's emotions. At this time, he saw that his comrade Ma Hongjun was very strong, and the soil basket was full, overflowing, and praised by everyone. So, while looking at Ma Hongjun's labor image, he came up with ideas in his mind and wrote four lines: "Lifting basket general, Ma Hongjun, lifting a full three hundred catties, the whole company praises him, everyone calls him Lu Zhishen." After the radio station broadcast it, everyone felt it was very energetic, and the scene suddenly became lively.

Not long ago, he visited a people's commune. After returning to the work shed in the evening, he was excited and wrote thirty-five poems on the theme of "The People's Commune is Good" under the lamp in one breath. He also thought of the role played by the brilliance of the General Line on the road of the people's progress, and successively wrote sixty-five poems praising the General Line. He said: "Writing poetry is not difficult, only fear that you have a sense of inferiority; liberate your thinking and write boldly, use your brain to think about everything, write a few sentences to explain one thing clearly, rhyme and it becomes a poem." He felt uncomfortable if he didn't write for a day, so he wrote four sentences for this: "When the white paper is used up, we'll add more, when the poems are outdated, we'll compile them again; write and read them in time, poems can promote work." Writing in the morning and writing in the evening, he unknowingly wrote ten thousand poems. He said: "Ten thousand poems are not too many, we must let the poems fill the Haihe River; the Haihe River has a bottom, but the poems are endless, the triumphant songs of taming the sea will never be finished!"

    “万首诗歌手”
    陈珍
    杜宗鲁是海河建闸工地上的一名普通战士。今年才十九岁，只有高小文化程度。过去他没有写过诗，到工地后才开始学着写。可是现在，工棚里贴着他的诗，工地报刊上有他的诗，广播站也时常广播他的诗；他已经成为海河建闸工地有名的“万首诗歌手”之一了。谈起写诗，他谦逊地说：他只不过编了些顺口溜，称不起诗。接着念道：“战士不敢称诗手，只因好事天天有，不写不唱怪别扭，写它几首献献丑”
    两个多月以前，他这个解放军战士，随着部队来到了海河建闸工地。他看到这里的工程规模是那么宏大，千军万马的劳动场面又是那么雄伟，心里就深为激动。同时，许多战士都挥起笔来写诗作文，反映工地上的生活和斗争。杜宗鲁想到自己已经参与了这个移山填海的英雄事业，也就跃跃欲试，但他一晚上苦苦思量，想出了四句。可是，自己默念几遍，越念越觉得不带劲。工地上是热火朝天，而他写出来的却是平平淡淡。
    也就在这时候，战士们住的工棚里掀起了写诗热潮，每天下工以后，满棚满炕都是战士在写诗篇。在新辟的“诗歌园地”里也出现了许多出自战士手笔的好诗。杜宗鲁也决心下苦功来学写诗，他用雪连纸钉了个厚本子，在第一张上写了四句：“钉个草稿本，口袋里面装，只要有空闲，就来写几行”。现在，这个本子上密密麻麻写了足有上千行的诗句。草稿本和笔就装在衣兜里，工余饭后；甚至连过摆渡的一刻时间也不肯放松。就这样“人不离本，本不离人”，随时写，随地写。不到一个月，长长短短的诗歌写了一千多首。写作热情越来越高涨，他写道：“写诗一千首，想想还是有，提起跃进笔，再写几千首。”
    当时工地上劳动非常紧张，但是，杜宗鲁写的诗特别多，而且也写出了一些比较好的诗。比如：“战士和太阳赛跑，累得太阳把替班找，月亮刚刚一露面，连忙说我替不了！”
    当他在写作上稍有门路以后，就特别注意搜集先进人物、事例，作为写作的题材；尽量使自己写出的诗歌能为劳动斗争服务。在运土的时候，他就想：找个“标兵”表扬一下，鼓动鼓动大家的情绪。这时他看到战友马洪钧很有力气，土筐装得满满的，冒了尖，受到大家称赞。于是他一面打量着马洪钧的劳动形象，一边就在脑子里动点子，编了四句：“抬筐将，马洪钧，一抬足有三百斤，全连人人都称赞，声声称他鲁智深”。编成以后广播站一传播，大家觉得挺带劲，现场顿时活跃起来。
    不久以前他去参观了一个人民公社，晚上回工棚以后，心情激动，就在灯下以“人民公社好”为题，一口气写下了三十五首诗歌。他又联想到总路线的光辉在人民前进的道路上所起的作用，就接连写下六十五首歌颂总路线的诗歌。他说：“写诗歌并不难，只怕你有自卑感；思想解放大胆写，遇事用脑想一番，几句写清一件事，合辙压韵成一篇。”他一天不写就不舒畅，他为此还编了四句：“白纸用完咱再添，诗歌过时咱再编；及时编写及时读，诗歌能把工作促。”朝写暮写，不知不觉就写成了一万篇。他说：“万首诗歌不算多，要让诗歌填海河；海河有底诗无尽，驯海凯歌唱不完！”
