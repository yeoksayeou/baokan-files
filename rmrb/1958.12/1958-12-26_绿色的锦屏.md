    Jinping County in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou Province is a minority area with the Dong ethnic group as the majority.
    Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party, the average grain yield has increased from less than 300 jin per mu before liberation to 500 jin in 1957. This year, in particular, the leap forward has been even greater, with rice alone reaching more than 700 jin. It has changed from a perennially grain-deficient county to a surplus grain county, and oil production has also reached self-sufficiency with a surplus. Now 95% of the county's forest farmers have reached the level of middle peasants.
    Great achievements have also been made in afforestation, young forest tending, and timber production. During the First Five-Year Plan, the county afforested more than 250,000 mu and harvested and sold 600,000 cubic meters of timber. This year, the county's timber production task is 130,000 cubic meters, and 150,000 cubic meters have already been completed, striving to over fulfill the target by 60,000 cubic meters, directly supporting the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. At the same time, the income of forest farmers has greatly increased, with forestry income accounting for more than 50% of the county's total income. As a result of active afforestation, tending, and strengthening forest fire prevention work, the county's existing timber reserves, calculated at the selling price, can be converted into more than 700 million yuan. In addition, many fast-growing "eight-year fir" and "nine-year fir" have emerged. Especially on the basis of the great victory of the rectification movement, the enthusiasm of the masses soared. Under the encouragement of the general line of building socialism, an unprecedented high tide of afforestation was set off. The slogan "Turn poor mountains into rich mountains, turn barren mountains into green mountains" resounded throughout the county. Forest farmers used their energy and hard work to fight hard for more than ninety days and completed the county's afforestation task.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party, the county's forestry work is moving towards a new direction—high-yield, fast-growing timber production and the development of the forest chemical industry. In order to develop forest resources and comprehensively utilize forest by-products, dozens of industrial raw materials such as baked rubber, diesel, turpentine, aromatic oil, fir smoke, and rosin have now been made using indigenous methods, and most of them have been mass-produced. The comprehensive utilization of forest industrial is developing at high speed. Forest farmers said: "In the past, the mountains were poor and the trees were bitter, now they are deep mountain treasures, and even a branch has become gold." Comprehensive Afforestation, Forest-Grain Intercropping
    At the beginning of the afforestation campaign, the experiences of Wanfeng Cooperative, a national model of forestry, in implementing basic greening and forest-grain intercropping were carefully summarized. The county organized key personnel and activists to visit Qingjiang Cooperative’s large-scale land preparation and afforestation experience. Educating the masses with practical examples greatly inspired their enthusiasm and boosted their morale. The labor force invested in the afforestation campaign accounted for more than 80% of the county's total labor force, with 40% participating in field teams. Forest farmers worked day and night in freezing weather. As a result, more than one million mu were afforested, with each laborer afforesting an average of 23.8 mu. This afforestation achievement is more than three times the afforestation area in the years since liberation, equivalent to the total historical afforestation area before liberation. All suitable barren hills and wastelands were basically eliminated within the county, realizing the first step in greening. In terms of the tree species cultivated, timber forests accounted for 83.7% and special economic forests accounted for 16.3%. In the afforestation campaign, technical guidance was strengthened, more than 5,000 afforestation technicians were trained, and technical guidance groups were organized in cooperatives and teams, thus ensuring quality. A comprehensive inspection in June this year showed that the survival rate reached over 90%.
    In order to fully utilize the land use rate and increase income faster, the practice of timber forest and economic forest coexistence was also adopted. That is, mixed planting of fir with tung oil trees, tea trees, and nan bamboo. Nan bamboo and tea trees yield income in three years, and tung oil trees and raw lacquer yield income in four years. The rational organization of short-term income supported long-term production and overcame the shortcomings of the timber forest’s overdue income period.
    In order to strengthen the management of forest trees and consolidate afforestation achievements, the county established 179 cooperative-run forest farms to carry out diversified operations with forestry as the main focus.
    Implementing comprehensive land preparation and afforestation, forest-grain intercropping, can also ensure the survival of young forests and promote rapid fir growth. This is a successful experience accumulated by local forest farmers, and it is also a good way to combine the long-term interests of afforestation with the immediate interests of the masses. According to surveys by Wanfeng, Sanjiang and other cooperatives and state-owned forest farms, forest-grain intercropping can increase a large amount of grain income.

    Cultivate Fast and High-Yielding Forests
    Under the new situation of the all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and on the basis of basically completing the initial greening task in the county, a fast and high-yield forest movement was launched. How to make trees grow rapidly and increase forest products as soon as possible to meet national and civilian needs is a new issue raised by forest farmers after the initial completion of afforestation. The problem was discovered in Wanfeng, Jiaodong and other cooperatives. During the spring afforestation campaign, the county party committee organized several working groups to visit forest farmers in these two cooperatives, and only then did they discover many fast-growing firs. This made us clear about the direction of cultivating fast and high-yielding trees after afforestation. According to incomplete statistics, there are 6,600 mu and more than 1.3 million fir trees in the county, including the "eight-year fir" and "sixteen-year fir" in Longgang, and the "eighteen fir" in Pingweng and Hekou. After actual measurement, they are indeed fast and high-yielding. This is a miracle created by the vast number of forest farmers under the correct leadership of the Party, who were distributed land and mountains and greatly exerted their enthusiasm for production. It is also a "satellite" that has appeared in forestry production.
    The vast masses of the county have launched a fast-growing movement to change "eighteen fir" to "ten fir." As of the current statistics, the county has cultivated 520,000 mu of fast and high-yielding forests (most of which are forest-grain intercropping). The county plans to cultivate one million mu of fast-growing fir forests. It is estimated that in ten years, the county's timber reserves will reach more than 100 million cubic meters, and the annual felling volume will be equal to 50 to 100 times the current timber production.
    According to investigation and research, the technical measures for cultivating fast and high-yielding fir forests mainly include careful land preparation, forest-grain intercropping, careful selection of superior varieties, cultivation of strong seedlings, root cultivation and fertilization, and timely weeding and pruning of seedlings.
    Taking fast and high yields as the guiding principle in forestry has also promoted young forest tending, timber production, and seed collection.

    Strengthen Leadership, Leap Forward Again and Again
    Strengthening the Party's leadership, putting politics in command, relying on the masses, and giving full play to the production enthusiasm of the masses are important guarantees for the great leap forward in forestry production. In the afforestation campaign, Jinping County adopted the method of secretaries taking the lead, the whole party taking action, and mobilizing the whole people to concentrate their efforts on mass movements for a period of time. The following are descriptions of several major tasks:
    (1) Conscientiously implement the Party’s general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," adhere to the principle of relying on the masses and cooperatives to carry out afforestation, and actively develop state-owned forest farms. In combination with the local specific situation, implement forest-grain intercropping to feed the long term with the short term, and solved the problem of combining long-term and immediate interests. In this way, the masses easily accept it, making afforestation a conscious action of the masses.
      (2) Secretaries take the lead, the whole party takes action, and the whole people are mobilized. In the division of labor of the county party committee, there are county party committee secretaries and members who are in charge of forestry production, and a forestry department has been established in the county party committee. The public security bureau has also established a forestry security section. The party organizations of districts, townships, and cooperatives also have secretaries and members responsible for forestry. At the same time, greening committees have been established at all levels, with party and government leaders serving as chairmen and workers, peasants, merchants, students, soldiers, transportation, culture, and education serving as committee members. In this way, the whole people can be better mobilized to participate in greening more widely.
    (3) Strengthen ideological and political work and put politics in command. Throughout the entire movement, the rectification was firmly grasped, the three major isms and five airs were opposed among the leaders, and right-leaning thoughts were overcome. Among some of the masses, the main thing was to criticize capitalist ideology. During the movement, several special great airing, great blooming, and great debates were launched. Whatever we did, we aired, bloomed, and debated. We were producing and rectifying at the same time. With the solution of these ideological problems, the production wave became higher and higher, and the production plan was constantly being broken by actual actions.
      (4) Experiment at all levels, break superstitions, and emancipate the mind. There are more than 5,000 mu of forestry experimental sites at all levels in the county. In the experimental forest of the county party committee, 400 fir and tung oil trees were planted, with a survival rate of 100%. Topdressing was applied four times, and intercropping of corn and sweet potatoes was carried out, and the forest and grain grew well. The forest farm experimented with afforestation 24 times a year, and carried out work in different seasons, different climates, and different temperatures, and the survival rate reached over 90%. In the development of the rapid and high-yield movement, the county party committee also experimented with one mu of fir forest that was deeply turned to four feet, applied 220,000 jin of fertilizer, and densely planted 6,000 trees, planning to become timber in eight years or even a shorter time, and the accumulation volume per mu was required to reach 2,100 cubic meters to play a demonstrative role. Twenty-four forestry scientific research institutes and one forestry university were established in the county, and 59 forestry middle schools were established. All of these are fighting to achieve rapid and high-yield forest production.
      (5) Vigorous technical innovation, the county engaged in 95 wooden rail flatcars, 50,000 meters long, 53 aerial ropeways, more than 17,000 meters, more than 100 earth and wood slides, and more than 40 earth cranes. The county basically realized vehicleization. These reforms have increased the labor force by several to dozens of times.

    绿色的锦屏
    贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州锦屏县是一个以侗族为多数的少数民族地区。
    解放以后，在党的英明领导下，粮食平均产量由解放前每亩不到三百斤提高到1957年的五百斤，特别是今年跃进更大，光水稻就达到了七百多斤。由常年缺粮县变成了余粮县，油料也达到了自给有余，现在全县有95％林农达到了中农水平。
    在植树造林、幼林抚育、木材生产等方面也取得了巨大成绩。在第一个五年计划期间，全县共造林二十五万余亩，采伐出售木材六十万余立方公尺。今年全县木材生产任务十三万立方公尺，现已完成十五万立方公尺，争取超额完成六万立方公尺，直接支援了武汉长江大桥、三门峡水库、包兰铁路、鞍山钢铁公司等地的建设用材。同时大大增加了林农收入，全县林业收入占总收入50％以上。由于积极造林，抚育和加强护林防火工作的结果，全县现有木材蓄积量按出售价格计算，可折人民币七亿多元。此外，还出现了许多快速生长的“八年杉”“九年杉”。特别是在整风运动取得伟大胜利的基础上，群众干劲冲天，在建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，掀起了一个史无前例的造林运动高潮。“把穷山变富山，把荒山变绿山”的口号响遍全县各个角落。林农们用自己的干劲和钻劲，苦战了九十多天，完成了全县植树造林任务。
    全县林业工作在党的正确领导下，又向新的方向——林木快速高额丰产和林化工业发展。为了开发林区资源，综合利用林木副产品，现在已用土办法制成了烤胶、柴油、松节油、芳香油、杉烟、松香等几十种工业原料，大部分已大量生产。林木综合利用工业正在高速度发展。林农们说：“过去是穷山苦树，现在是深山宝库，一根木杈也变成了黄金”。全面造林  林粮混作
    造林运动开始的时候，认真总结了全国林业模范——万丰社实行基本绿化和实行林粮混作的经验，并组织了全县主要骨干和积极分子参观了清江社大面积整土造林经验。以实际事例教育群众，大大地启发了群众热情，鼓舞了干劲，全县投入造林运动的劳力占全县劳动力的80％以上，内有40％参加野战队。林农们在冰天雪地、气候严寒的日子里，夜以继日地工作着，结果造林一百多万亩，每个劳动力平均造林二十三点八亩。这次造林成绩等于解放几年来造林面积的三倍多，相当于解放前历史造林面积的总和。在全县范围内基本上消灭了所有的宜林荒山荒地，实现了绿化第一步。从栽培的树种看，用材林占83.7％，特用经济林占16.3％。在造林运动中加强了技术指导工作，训练了五千多造林技术员，社社队队组织了技术指导小组，因此保证了质量。今年6月全面检查，成活率达90％以上。
    为了充分发挥土地使用率和较快的增加收入，还采取用材林与经济林伴生的做法。即杉木与油桐、茶叶、南竹等混交。南竹、茶叶三年，油桐、生漆四年即有收入。合理地组织短期收入，支援了长期生产，克服了用材林收益期过迟的缺点。
    为了加强林木的经营管理，巩固造林成果，全县共办了一百七十九个社办林场，以林业为主开展多种经营。
    实行全面整地造林，林粮混作，还可以保证幼林成活，促使杉木速成。这是当地林农积累下来的成功经验，也是把造林长远利益和群众眼前利益结合起来的好办法。据万丰、三江等社及国营林场的调查，林粮混作则可以增加一大笔粮食收入。
  培养林木快速丰产
    在工农业生产全面大跃进的新形势下，在全县基本完成初步绿化任务的基础上，开展了林木快速高额丰产运动。如何使林木达到快速生长，尽快地增加森林产品以应国需民用，这是林农们在初步完成造林以后提出来的新问题。问题的发现是在万丰、皎洞等社。在春季造林运动中，县委组织了几个工作组深入访问这两个社的林农，才发现了许多快速丰产杉。这就使我们明确了造林以后培养林木快速丰产的方向。据不完全统计，全县有六千六百亩一百三十多万株杉，其中有龙埂“八年杉”“十六年杉”，平翁、河口的“十八杉”等，经过实测结果，确是快速高额丰产。这是广大林农在党的正确领导下，分得土地山林，大大地发挥了生产积极性，用自己的干劲和钻劲创造出来的奇迹，也是出现在林业生产上的“卫星”。
    全县广大群众掀起了一个改“十八杉”为“十杉”的快速丰产运动，截至目前统计，全县培育的快速高额丰产林已达五十二万亩（大部分是林粮间作）。全县计划培育杉木快速丰产林一百万亩，预计十年后，全县木材蓄积量将达到一亿多立方公尺，年可伐量等于目前木材生产的五十至一百倍。
    培育杉木快速高额丰产林的技术措施，根据调查研究，主要有细致整地、林粮混作、精选良种、培育壮苗、培根施肥和适时薅修幼苗等。
    在林业上以快速高额丰产为纲，还推动了幼林抚育、木材生产和采种等工作。加强领导跃进再跃进
    加强党的领导，政治挂帅，依靠群众，发挥群众的生产积极性，这是林业生产大跃进的重要保证。在造林运动中，锦屏县采取书记挂帅，全党动手，全民动员，在一个时期集中力量搞群众运动的办法。现将几个主要工作叙述如下：
    （1）认真贯彻执行党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线，坚持依靠群众、合作社造林为主，同时积极发展国营林场的方针。并结合当地具体情况，贯彻了林粮间作，以短养长，解决了远近利益的结合问题。这样群众易于接受，使造林形成群众的自觉行动。
      （2）书记挂帅，全党动手，全民动员，在县委分工上，有专管林业生产的县委书记和委员，并在县委建立了林业部，在公安局增设了林业保卫股，区乡社的党组织也有书记、委员负责林业。同时各级还建立了绿化委员会，党政负责人任主任委员，工、农、商、学、兵、交通、文教等任委员。这样就能更广泛地很好地动员全民参加绿化。
    （3）加强思想政治工作，作到政治挂帅。在整个运动中，紧紧抓住了整风这条纲，在领导当中反掉了三大主义和五气，克服了右倾思想，在部分群众中，主要是批判了资本主义思想。在运动中开展了几个专题的大鸣、大放、大辩论，凡作什么就鸣放辩论什么，边生产边整风。随着这些思想问题的解决，生产浪潮就越来越高，生产计划不断的被实际行动突破。
      （4）层层试验，破除迷信，解放思想。全县已有各级林业试验地五千多亩，县委的试验林，栽杉、桐各四百株，成活率达100％，追肥四次，间种苞谷、红苕，林粮生长良好。林场试验一年二十四次造林，在不同的季节、不同的气候、不同的温度都搞，而成活率达90％以上。在开展快速高额丰产运动中，县委又试验了一亩翻深达四尺，施肥二十二万斤，密植六千株的杉木林，计划八年或更短一点时间成材，每亩蓄积量要求达到二千一百立方公尺，以起示范作用。全县成立了林业科学研究所二十四个，创办林业大学一所，林业中学五十九所。所有这些都一致为实现林木快速高额丰产而奋斗。
      （5）大搞技术革新，全县搞了木轨平车九十五处，长达五万多公尺，架空索道五十三处，一万七千多公尺，土木滑道一百多处，土起重机四十余架，全县基本实现了车子化。这些改革，使劳动力提高了几倍到几十倍。
