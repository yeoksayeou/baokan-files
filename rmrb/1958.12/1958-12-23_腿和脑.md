    Legs and Brain
    Lu Zhongquan
    Currently, we are marching on the "broad road" with "two legs."
    For a country as poor and blank as ours, it is extremely important to be able to quickly learn to walk on two legs in socialist construction, find a broad road for construction that is fast, good, and economical, and gain rich experience on this road. This means how much happiness our 600 million people have! From this, we understand why there was such a great leap forward in 1958, and we also understand the great significance of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, and we are therefore full of confidence in the greater leap forward in 1959!
    However, how did we learn to walk? How was the broad road found?
    Naturally, we cannot help but think of our Soviet elder brother first. They have been walking for decades longer than us, always ahead of us. We can see what they have done, and their successful and unsuccessful experiences are examples for us to learn from and observe. They are of great help to us. This is exactly what is meant by "using others as a mirror, one can know gains and losses." However, learning to walk with one's own legs and being able to find a broad road leading to a common goal in one's own foothold requires a scientific mind, requires thought, analysis, exploration, and the ability to dare to practice and master direction. Walking on two legs is learned through "great practice," and the broad road is discovered through "great practice."
    What are "two legs"? They are the whole set of principles of "simultaneous development" and "combination" pointed out by the Party Central Committee in the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. "Simultaneous development" and "combination" both embody the unity of opposites in things. If only one aspect is considered and the other is ignored, there will only be one leg or one and a half legs left, and walking will naturally be wobbly and limping.
    What is "great practice"? It is practice under the guidance of Marxism; it is creative practice through hundreds of millions of people under the leadership of the Party. This is also the mass line and the large-scale mass movement that our Party often advocates. Of course, blindly drilling without the judgment of the mind does not deserve to be called "great practice." Adventurously charging into the enemy camp single-handedly cannot be called great practice, and the random collisions of a mob do not deserve to be called great practice.
    Mr. Lu Xun said that roads are made by people. This is true. Roads are indeed made by people, and this walking is practice. But people must have a brain and be able to judge direction. If it is "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night," I am afraid that even half a step will not work.
    From this, it can be seen how important the brain, thought, and theory are to people. We must remember that our Party can fight against all "left" and "right" deviations and can identify the direction in front of all kinds of illusions and move forward continuously precisely because our Party has the scientific mind of Marxism. With this mind, there can be "two legs," there can be "great practice," and there can be a broad road. Just take a look at "two legs" and "great practice" and you will see how rich and profound philosophical principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism are contained in these simple and clear slogans!
    Philosophy comes from practice, and it enriches and develops Marxist philosophy, which is true; but Marxist philosophy also produces socialism and a broad road. From this, I think of the importance of all our cadres and all socialist builders combining practice with the study of philosophy. Let us arm our minds more!

    腿和脑 
    陆钟泉
    现在，我们正用“两条腿”行进在“康庄大道”上。
    对于我们这样一个一穷二白的国家，在社会主义建设中，能够很快学会两条腿走路，找到一条多快好省地建设的康庄大道，并且在这条大道上取得了丰富的经验，这是十分重要的。这意味着我们六亿人民有多么大的幸福！从这里，我们懂得了1958年为什么会有这么大的跃进，我们也懂得了1958年工农业大跃进有多么重大的意义，而我们对1959年更大的跃进，又因此充满多大的信心！
    但是，走路是怎样学会的？康庄大道是怎样找到的？
    自然，我们不能不先想到我们的苏联老大哥。他们比我们早走了几十年，一直走在我们的前面，我们可以看到他们作出的样子，他们成功的和不成功的经验，都是我们学习和观摩的榜样。对我们都有很大的帮助。这正是所谓“以人为鉴可知得失”。但是，学会用自己的腿走路，能在自己立足的地方，找到通向共同目标的康庄大道，这却需要有科学的头脑，需要思想，要分析，要探究，要有勇于实践和善于掌握方向的本领。两条腿走路是通过“伟大的实践”学会的，康庄大道是通过“伟大的实践”发现的。
    什么是“两条腿”？就是党中央在八届六中全会的公报里所指出的那几个“并举”和“结合”的一整套方针。“并举”和“结合”都是体现了事物的对立统一，只要一面而忽略了另一面，便会只剩下一条腿或者是一条半腿，走起路来自然就要东摇西摆地颠来跛去了。
    什么是“伟大的实践”？就是马克思主义指导下的实践；就是在党的领导下，通过亿万人民群众的创造性的实践。这也就是我们党所经常提倡的群众路线，和大搞群众运动。当然，不通过头脑的判断，而盲目地瞎钻，不配称为“伟大的实践”。匹马单枪地冒险踹营陷阵，不能称为伟大的实践，乌合之众的乱撞乱碰也不配称为伟大的实践。
    鲁迅先生说过，路是人走出来的。这一点不假。路的确是人走出来的，这走就是实践。但人必须有头脑，要能判断方向，倘是“盲人乘瞎马，夜半临深池”，怕连半步也行不通。
    由此可以看到，头脑、思想、理论，对于人有多么重要。我们要切记，我们党能同一切“左”的和“右”的偏向作斗争，能在种种假象面前识辨方向，不断向前，正是因为我们党有着马克思主义的科学的头脑。有了这头脑，才能有“两条腿”，才能有“伟大的实践”，也才能有康庄大道。只要去考察一下“两条腿”和“伟大的实践”就会看出，在这些简单明确的口号中，含有多么丰富和多么深刻的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的哲学原理啊！
    实践中出哲学，而且丰富和发展马克思主义哲学，这是不错的；但是马克思主义哲学中又出社会主义，出康庄大道。由此我想到，我们全体干部、全体社会主义建设者，结合实践学习哲学的重要。多多武装自己的头脑吧！
