Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th: The United Nations General Assembly held a vote on the resolution regarding the Algerian issue, which had been passed by the Political Committee, on the evening of the 13th. The results of the vote were: 35 votes in favor, 18 votes against, and 28 abstentions. Because it missed the required two-thirds majority (36 votes) by only one vote, the resolution did not pass. The resolution was proposed by seventeen Asian-African countries. It had been amended before the General Assembly vote, but it still demanded recognition of the Algerian people's right to independence and advocated for resolving the Algerian issue through negotiations.

Voting in favor were many Asian-African countries and socialist countries. Greece and Ireland also voted in favor. Voting against included many colonial powers, such as Britain, Italy, and Portugal.

Many Latin American countries abstained.

The United States, which voted against the seventeen-nation Asian-African proposal in the Political Committee, abstained in the General Assembly vote. It is said that this was because, given the majority of countries in the Political Committee supported the proposal, the United States had to change its approach in the General Assembly.

France did not participate in the vote as a boycott of the assembly's discussion.

After the vote, Yazid, the Minister of Information of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, told reporters that the vote showed that the majority of world public opinion supported Algeria's position. He said that the Algerian Provisional Government would hold a meeting to study the situation and decide on future actions.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th: Yesterday, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded the debate on the Algerian issue and passed the proposal put forward by the seventeen-nation Asian-African delegation with 32 votes in favor, 18 votes against, and 30 abstentions. Colonialist countries suffered another defeat in the United Nations.

Before the overall vote on the seventeen-nation proposal, a vote was taken on each section. Every section of the proposal was passed.

The newly joined Guinea representative participated in the vote and voted in favor of the Asian-African countries' proposal. The United States and Britain voted against it, and the French representative was "absent." Representatives from fourteen Latin American countries, some members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and countries participating in other military blocs with the United States abstained in the vote. This proposal will eventually be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for a vote.

In order to salvage the impending defeat, the colonial powers instructed Haiti to propose a so-called amendment at yesterday's meeting that attempted to erase the Algerian people's right to independence and effectively deny recognition of the legitimate Algerian Provisional Government. This amendment demanded the deletion of the phrase "recognize the Algerian people's right to independence" from the seventeen-nation Asian-African proposal, replacing it with "recognize the Algerian people's right to determine their own destiny." The amendment also maliciously changed the term "Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria" in the seventeen-nation proposal to "leaders of the Algerian liberation movement."

However, the members of the Political Committee rejected Haiti's first amendment to the seventeen-nation proposal with 48 votes against 13 votes and 19 abstentions. At this time, the representative of Haiti quickly withdrew his second amendment, not daring to put this part to a vote.

Indian representative Menon made a lengthy speech at the meeting yesterday. He said that France should listen to the calls of representatives of many countries in the United Nations General Assembly.

Menon said that Algeria is a country whose independence has been violated; and France has played the role of "an aggressor," "France's position is one of aggression and launching a war."

Menon said that the rights of Algeria are in the hands of the Algerian people, and the provisional government represents the people. He said that although India has not yet recognized this government, it still believes that there is no other way to solve the Algerian problem except to negotiate with this government. It is a huge mistake for some countries to think that years of war will suppress a nation's desire for freedom.

Menon refuted France's insistence that Algeria is part of France. He particularly pointed out that in the past, when the United Nations discussed the issue of Tunisia, France always said that Tunisians were French. However, today Tunisia is already a member of the international community.

Tunisian representative Slim pointed out that the French government must recognize the Algerian people's natural and legitimate right to restore sovereignty and independence. The provisional government is a qualified spokesperson for the fighting Algerian people, and it is prepared to negotiate with France, so the General Assembly has a responsibility to pay attention to this factor. He said that the only logical way to restore peace is through negotiation.

At yesterday's meeting, only the speeches of the representatives of South Africa, Britain, and Italy expressed the complete views of the colonialist countries.

### 世界舆论站在阿尔及利亚人民一边  亚非国家提案在联大政委会得到通过  在大会上仅差一票未达三分之二多数

    世界舆论站在阿尔及利亚人民一边
    亚非国家提案在联大政委会得到通过
    在大会上仅差一票未达三分之二多数
    新华社14日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议13日晚上就政治委员会通过的关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案进行表决。表决结果：三十五票赞成，十八票反对，二十八票弃权。由于仅以一票之差没有获得通过这个提案所需要的三分之二的票数（三十六票），这个提案没有通过。这个提案是由亚非十七个国家提出的，它在大会表决前曾作了修改，但仍然要求承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利，并且主张通过谈判来解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    投赞成票的是许多亚非国家和社会主义国家，希腊和爱尔兰也投赞成票。投反对票的包括许多殖民国家，如英国、意大利和葡萄牙等。
    弃权的有许多是拉丁美洲国家。
    在政治委员会上对亚非十七国提案投反对票的美国在大会表决时弃权。据说这是因为鉴于政治委员会多数国家赞成这个提案，美国在大会上不得不改变一下做法。
    法国由于抵制大会的讨论没有参加投票。
    在表决后，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣传部长亚齐德对记者说，这次投票表明世界舆论的大多数人士都支持阿尔及利亚的立场。他说，阿尔及利亚临时政府将要举行会议研究形势，以决定以后采取什么行动。
    新华社14日讯  纽约消息：昨天联合国大会政治委员会结束了关于阿尔及利亚问题的辩论，并且以三十二票对十八票、三十票弃权，通过了亚非十七国代表团提出的提案。殖民主义国家在联合国又遭到了一次失败。
    在就十七国提案进行总表决之前，进行了分段表决。提案的每一段都获得了通过。
    新加入联合国的几内亚代表参加了表决，它投票赞成亚非国家的提案。美国、英国投了反对票，法国代表“缺席”。有十四个拉丁美洲国家的代表、一些北大西洋集团成员国和参加美国的其它军事集团的国家的代表，在投票时弃权。这个提案最后还要提交联合国大会全体会议表决。
    殖民主义国家为了挽救眼看就要遭到的失败，指使海地在昨天会议上提出了企图抹杀阿尔及利亚人民独立权利和实际上不承认合法的阿尔及利亚临时政府的所谓修正案。这个修正案要求把亚非十七国提案中的“承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利”这句话删去，而代之以“承认阿尔及利亚人民决定其自己命运的权利”。修正案还别有用心地把十七国提案中“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府”这个名词改为“阿尔及利亚解放运动领袖”字样。
    但是，政治委员会会员以四十八票对十三票、十九票弃权拒绝了海地对十七国提案的第一个改动。这时，海地的代表连忙撤回他的第二个改动，不敢再把这部分提付表决了。
    印度代表梅农昨天在会上作了长篇发言。他说，法国应当听取许多国家的代表在联合国大会的呼声。
    梅农说，阿尔及利亚是其独立遭到侵犯的一个国家；而法国则扮演了“一个侵略者的角色”，“法国的地位是进行侵略和发动战争的地位”。
    梅农说，阿尔及利亚的权利在阿尔及利亚人民手里，而临时政府则代表着人民。他说，虽然印度还没有承认这个政府，但是仍然相信，除了同这个政府谈判之外，没有解决阿尔及利亚问题的其他任何办法。一些国家以为经过多年战争就会压制一个民族争取自由的愿望，那是绝大的错误。
    梅农驳斥了法国硬说阿尔及利亚是法国的一部分的说法。他特别指出，过去联合国在讨论突尼斯问题的时候，法国总说突尼斯人是法国人。但是，今天突尼斯已经是国际大家庭当中的一员了。
    突尼斯代表斯陵指出，法国政府必须承认阿尔及利亚人民有恢复主权和独立的天然的合法权利。临时政府是战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民的有资格的发言人，它准备同法国谈判，因此大会有责任注意这个因素。他说，恢复和平的唯一合乎逻辑的办法是谈判。
    在昨天会议上，只有南非联邦、英国和意大利代表的发言表达了十足的殖民主义国家的观点。
