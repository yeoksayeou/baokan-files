Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 24th: Zhejiang is strengthening fertilization combined with frost and drought prevention for overwintering crops, ensuring a bumper harvest of spring flowers next year.

    Some cadres and masses in areas such as Jiande and Ningbo once held opinions such as "With good winter planting quality this year, spring flower cultivation can be taken slowly" and "Overwintering crops are not afraid of drought." This time, through mass inspections and debates, these arguments were broken down, and cultivation work was vigorously launched. After inspection and debate, Weiping Commune in Chun'an County adopted methods of "combining fertilization with drought resistance, weeding with deep plowing, fertilization with frost prevention, and manure accumulation with pest elimination," launching a mass campaign to cultivate overwintering crops. In two days, 80% of the overwintering crops were cultivated once, over 12,000 mu of drought-stricken crops were watered, over 19,000 mu of wheat were fertilized, and over 12,000 mu of rapeseed were cultivated to prevent frost. Fenghua County universally launched a water irrigation campaign to protect seedlings through field-by-field inspection and on-the-spot debates. During a field-by-field inspection, the Feiyue Commune found that 60% of the 70 mu of rapeseed in the Wu Dun team of the Fourth Production Team had withered and yellowed, but the 300 mu of rapeseed in the Shu Jia Sixth Production Team grew very well due to the prompt scooping of water. This concrete fact more forcefully shattered the idea that winter irrigation was not possible. After the debates, various places actively arranged labor to divert water for irrigation. While irrigating to protect seedlings, they also universally applied night soil fertilizer and covered with ash fertilizer.

    Yinxian Qiu’ai Commune members learned from past experiences and lessons, and started early to comprehensively carry out frost prevention work for overwintering crops. 1. Mobilized more than 2,000 commune members and more than 1,500 boats to dig river mud in large quantities. Of the 27,000 mu of rapeseed, 12,584 mu have been watered with two boatloads of river mud per mu, which both prevents frost and increases fertilizer. 2. Dug deep ditches early and applied grass mulch to keep warm and fertilize. Of the more than 50,000 mu of grass seed fields, more than 19,500 mu have had deep ditches dug, and 38,000 mu have been fertilized with warming fertilizer. 3. Weaved large numbers of straw mats. Commune members utilized spare time to weave straw mats, and have already woven 50,567 straw mats, which can cover more than 3,900 mu of crops.

### 力争明年春花大丰收  浙江加强越冬作物的培育管理

    力争明年春花大丰收
    浙江加强越冬作物的培育管理
    新华社杭州24日电  浙江各地加强对越冬作物的施肥结合防冻防旱的培育工作，保证明年春花大丰收。
    建德、宁波等地区部分干部和群众中曾有“今年冬种质量好，春花培育可以慢慢来”，以及“越冬作物不怕旱”等的论调，这次通过全民大检查大辩论，打破了这种论调，大力展开培育工作。淳安县威坪公社在检查和辩论后，采用“施肥结合抗旱、铲草结合深耕、施肥结合防冻、积肥结合除害灭虫”的办法，开展了万人突击培育越冬作物运动，在两天中就将80％的越冬作物培育一次，一万二千多亩受旱的作物浇了水，一万九千多亩小麦施上肥料，一万二千多亩油菜进行培育防冻。奉化县通过逐畈检查、就地辩论的方法，普遍展开了灌水保苗运动。飞跃公社在逐畈检查时发现第四生产队吴墩小队的七十亩油菜有60％枯黄了，可是舒家第六生产队的三百亩油菜，由于抓紧戽水，却长得很好。这样就用具体的事实，更有力的打破了冬季不能灌水的思想。各地在辩论后都积极安排劳力，引水灌溉。在灌水保苗的同时，还普遍浇了一次粪肥，盖了一次灰肥。
    鄞县丘隘公社社员接受往年经验教训，提早动手全面做好越冬作物防冻工作。一、出动二千多社员、一千五百多只船，大挖河泥。二万七千亩油菜已有一万二千五百八十四亩因每亩浇上两船河泥，既防冻又增加肥料；二、提早开深沟，壅草子保暖肥。五万多亩草子田已有一万九千五百多亩开好深沟，三万八千亩田施上了保暖肥；三、大织草扇，社员们利用空隙织草扇，已织好草扇五万零五百六十七个，可盖三千九百多亩作物。
