Xinhua News Agency, 24th -- The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved the report on the Ten-Year Plan for Sports Development from the Party Group of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission on September 8th, in its circular on September 19th this year. The full text of the instructions is as follows: To the Party Committees of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the Working Committees of Tibet and Ningxia, all ministries and commissions of the Central Committee, Party Groups of state organs and people's organizations, and the General Political Department: The Central Committee agrees with the report on the Ten-Year Plan for Sports Development from the Party Group of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission. The fundamental task of sports is to enhance the people's physical fitness and serve labor production and national defense construction. According to this task, the guiding principle of sports is: adapt to the demands of the broad working people for enhanced physical fitness in the Great Leap Forward in production, vigorously develop mass sports activities, improve technical levels on the basis of the widespread development of sports activities, and constantly create new records. In places where people's communes have been organized, sports activities should be under the unified arrangement of the people's communes, combined with labor production, so that they become something that the broad masses enthusiastically love. Sports work must closely rely on the leadership of Party committees at all levels and resolutely implement the principle of putting politics in command. It is necessary to advocate among sports cadres, coaches, and athletes the breaking of superstitions, the liberation of thought, and overcoming bourgeois ideology and dogmatism. The First National Games, held to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, will promote the further development of sports in our country and will also have great significance internationally, so it must be held well.

    Responsible Person of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission Speaks
      Hold the First National Games Successfully and Unleash Mass Sports Activities

Xinhua News Agency, 24th -- When talking to Xinhua News Agency reporters today about the achievements of sports in our country this year, the responsible person of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission said: In 1958, sports in our country achieved unprecedented and rapid development.

The responsible person said that in order to welcome and adapt to the upsurge of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, since the beginning of this year, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have respectively formulated plans, convened sports meetings, and held sports activity weeks and sports competition months to mobilize and organize the broad masses to participate in sports, resulting in a wave of enthusiasm for the entire people to participate in physical exercise. Farmers, who rarely participated in sports activities in the past, have also flocked to sports fields in large numbers this year. In many factories, mines, enterprises, rural areas, schools, and government agencies, there have emerged units with good labor production, good cultural life, and well-developed sports activities. They have combined production and sports into one, so that sports activities effectively serve production and construction.

The responsible person said: As of November this year, the number of people nationwide who have passed the standards of the Labor and Defense System at all levels has exceeded ten million. Most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have established sports colleges or sports schools. Nearly 100,000 spare-time sports schools for teenagers have been established across the country, with 4 million students. On the basis of widespread mass sports activities, many sports talents and many talented athletes have emerged in various places. They have created many excellent results. At present, nine athletes across the country have broken world records eight times in weightlifting, swimming, and parachuting. In marathon, rowing, radio, and men's 100km and 200km road cycling events, dozens of athletes have also created world-class results. These exciting deeds are unprecedented in the past few years. This is the result of the broad masses of coaches and athletes, under the leadership of the Party, liberating their minds, breaking superstitions, and giving full play to their great communist enthusiasm.

The responsible person said that people's communes, including workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, have been generally established in rural areas. Because it has realized the militarization of organization, the combatization of action, the collectivization of life, and the democratization of management, it has brought more favorable conditions for carrying out sports activities. Chairman Mao once pointed out: The militia division is a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also pointed out in its circular on the "Report on the Ten-Year Plan for Sports Development" from the Party Group of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission: "In places where people's communes have been organized, sports activities should be under the unified arrangement of the people's communes, combined with labor production, so that they become something that the broad masses enthusiastically love." Therefore, people's communes in various places should, under unified arrangements, use militia organizations and other methods to carry out sports activities, so as to better enable sports activities to serve production, work, study, and national defense.

The responsible person finally said that in order to review the achievements of sports in our country over the past ten years, preparations for the First National Games to be held in 1959 are actively underway. The upsurge of promoting the national sports work with the National Games as the outline is also developing widely and deeply. Athletes from all over the country are actively training, striving to create even better results next year.

    国家体委负责人谈话
      开好第一届全国运动会掀起群众性的体育运动
    新华社24日讯  国家体委负责人今天在对新华社记者谈到今年我国体育运动的成就时说：1958年我国体育运动又得到了空前迅速的发展。
    这位负责人说，为了迎接和适应技术革命、文化革命的高潮，从今年年初起，各省、市、自治区就分别制定规划，召开体育会议，举办体育活动周和体育竞赛月等，发动和组织了广大群众参加体育运动，出现了全民参加体育锻炼的热潮。过去很少参加体育活动的农民，今年也大量涌到运动场上。在许多厂矿企业、农村、学校、机关，都出现了劳动生产好、文化生活好，体育运动也开展得好的单位。他们把生产和体育拧成一股绳，使体育运动有效地为生产建设服务。
    负责人说：截至今年11月止，全国通过各级劳卫制标准的，已超过一千万人。大部分省、市、自治区都开办了体育学院或体育学校。全国各地已建立青少年业余体育学校近十万所，学员达四百万人。在广泛开展群众体育运动的基础上，各地出现了不少运动健将和许多很有才能的运动员。他们创造了许多优良成绩。目前，全国已有九名运动员八次突破举重、游泳和跳伞的世界纪录。在马拉松、划船、无线电、男子一百公里和二百公里公路自行车等项运动中，也有几十名选手创造了具有世界水平的成绩。这些令人兴奋的事迹，是过去几年所没有的。这是广大教练员和运动员在党的领导下，解放思想、破除迷信、发挥伟大的共产主义干劲的结果。
    这位负责人说，包括工、农、商、学、兵的人民公社在农村已普遍建立。由于它实现了组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化和管理民主化，这就给开展体育运动带来了更为有利的条件。毛主席曾经指出：民兵师是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。中共中央批转国家体委党组“关于体育运动十年规划的报告”时也指出：“在组织了人民公社的地方，体育运动应在人民公社的统一安排下，结合劳动生产，使之成为广大群众热烈喜爱的事情。”因此，各地人民公社应在统一安排下，运用民兵组织和其他方法开展体育运动，更好地使体育运动为生产、工作、学习和国防服务。
    这位负责人最后说，为了检阅我国十年来体育运动的成就，将在1959年举行的第一届全国运动会的准备工作，正在积极进行。以全国运动会为纲推动全国体育工作的热潮，也正在广泛深入地开展。各地运动员正积极锻炼，争取明年创造出更优良的成绩。
