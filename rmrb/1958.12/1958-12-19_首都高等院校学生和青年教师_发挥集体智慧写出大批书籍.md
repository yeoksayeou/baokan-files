Students and Young Teachers in Beijing Higher Education Institutions Use Collective Wisdom to Write a Large Number of Books

(Reported by our newspaper) Students and young teachers from various higher education institutions in Beijing, closely integrated in scientific research and production practice, have collectively written many books, achieving a great harvest in both ideology and professional skills.

The books they wrote cover fields including literature, history, linguistics, philosophy, law, education, economics, journalism, engineering, and science. According to statistics from seven higher education institutions such as Renmin University of China and Peking University, over 300 books of various kinds have been written, and many of them have been published and received positive reviews from readers. For example, a 780,000-word "History of Chinese Literature" written by the "Fifth Five-Year Plan" students of the Chinese Department of Peking University, and a 600,000-word "History of Chinese Folk Literature" written by fourth-year students of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, both emphasize the struggle between the two roads in literature; they give new evaluations of writers and works with a popular character in literary history, embodying the spirit of making the past serve the present.

More than a dozen histories of the laboring people, such as "History of Mentougou Coal Mine," "History of Qinghe Woolen Mill," and "History of Tiancun Cooperative," written by students of the History Department of Beijing Normal University and Peking University during their labor in factories and rural areas, all use easy-to-understand language to narrate the historical achievements of the local laboring people's struggle for production and class struggle, opening up a new path for scientific research in history.

The five textbooks, "Introduction to Hydraulic Structures," "Farmland Water Conservancy Engineering," etc., written by the 1958 graduates of the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, were written after they participated in the engineering design of thirteen reservoirs including the Miyun Reservoir and conducted more than 30 scientific research projects. The books summarize their practical experience and the experience of the workers and peasants, which is very different from the kind of textbooks that were severely divorced from reality in the past. Among them, the book "Hydraulic Engineering Measurement and Model Test" summarizes the experience of peasants in using indigenous methods of measurement such as tripods and earthen compasses. Other books, such as "Flora of Beijing" compiled by teachers and students of the Biology Department of Beijing Normal University, and "Flora of Hebei Province" compiled by the Biology Department of Peking University, have new innovations in content and compilation methods.

These books were mainly written collectively by students and young teachers mobilized by the Party committees of various schools since August of this year. Although these students and young teachers still have certain limitations in their knowledge level, they believe in the leadership of the Party, have corrected their direction, and have great enthusiasm. They adopt the method of collective writing, which enables them to grasp a large amount of information and combine it with investigation and research. For example, when the students of the Chinese Department of Peking University wrote the "History of Chinese Literature," they consulted nearly a thousand kinds of books and magazines; when the students of the Foundry Specialty of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University wrote textbooks, they conducted on-the-spot investigations of sixty-one factories and interviewed more than two thousand workers. Therefore, they were able to successfully complete their tasks in a short period of time.

Through going down to factories and rural areas to conduct investigations and research, and writing histories for the laboring people, the broad masses of students and young teachers feel the urgent need to strengthen their own ideological transformation. One student in the History Department of Peking University, due to a lack of feelings for the laboring people, wrote lightly when describing the warlords' siege of Anyuan Coal Mine: "...The crisp sound of gunfire broke the morning of Anyuan." This is extremely uncoordinated with the historical achievements of the laboring people's heroic struggle. Through writing books, students and young teachers have broadened their horizons and increased their knowledge. They have realized that going to the laboring people can accelerate the transformation of their own positions, viewpoints, and thoughts and feelings. In this way, they learn more knowledge, learn it more deeply, learn it faster, remember it firmly, and learn it in a way that can be used.

Currently, students and young teachers in some colleges and universities have started writing a new batch of books. In addition to accepting the experience of the previous stage, they also welcome veteran teachers to participate in the writing. (Attached picture)

### 首都高等院校学生和青年教师  发挥集体智慧写出大批书籍

    首都高等院校学生和青年教师
    发挥集体智慧写出大批书籍
    本报讯  首都各高等院校的学生和青年教师密切结合，在科学研究和生产实习中，集体编写了许多书籍，在思想、业务上都得到了丰收。
    他们编写的书种类包括文学、史学、语言学、哲学、法律学、教育学、经济学、新闻学、工科、理科等方面。据中国人民大学、北京大学等七个高等学校统计，已编写各种书籍三百多部，其中不少书籍已经出版，并且受到了读者好评。如北京大学中文系“五五”级学生编写的一部七十八万字的“中国文学史”和北京师范大学中文系四年级学生编写的一部六十万字的“中国民间文学史”，都着重说明了文学上的两条道路的斗争；对文学史上具有人民性的作家和作品给予了新的评价，体现了古为今用的精神。
    北京师范大学、北京大学历史系学生在工厂、农村劳动中写的“门头沟煤矿史”、“清河制呢厂史”、“田村合作社史”等十几部劳动人民的历史，都用通俗易懂的语言叙述了当地劳动人民生产斗争和阶级斗争的史绩，给历史学的科学研究开创了一条新的途径。
    清华大学水利系1958年毕业生写的“水工概论”、“农田水利工程”等五本教科书，是他们参加了密云水库等十三个水库的工程设计和进行了三十多项科学研究以后写成的，书中总结了他们的实际经验和工农群众的经验，与过去那种严重脱离实际的教科书大不相同。其中“水工测量及模型试验”这本书，总结了农民群众用三角架、土圆心等土法测量经验。其它像北京师范大学生物系师生编写的“北京植物志”，北京大学生物系编写的“河北省植物志”，在内容和编写方法上都有了新的革新。
    这些书，主要是今年8月以来，各校党委发动学生和青年教师集体写成的。这些学生和青年教师尽管知识水平还有一定限制，但是，他们相信党的领导，端正了方向，干劲很大。他们采取集体写作的方法，能够掌握大量资料，并结合调查研究。如北大中文系学生写“中国文学史”时，翻阅了近千种书籍和杂志；清华大学机械系铸工专业学生在写教科书时，实地调查了六十一个工厂，访问了两千多个工人。因此，他们能在短期内胜利完成任务。
    通过下厂下乡调查研究，给劳动人民写历史，广大学生和青年教师感到急需加强自我思想改造。北大历史系的一个学生，由于缺乏劳动人民的情感，在描写军阀围攻安源煤矿时轻松地写道：“……清脆的枪声，划破了安源的早晨。”这和劳动人民英勇斗争的史绩极不协调。通过写书，学生和青年教师们开阔了眼界，增加了知识，他们认识到：到劳动人民中去，可以加速从立场、观点、思想感情上改造自己。这样学的知识多，学的深，学的快，记的牢固，学的能用。
    目前，有些院校的学生和青年教师又动手写一批新书，他们除了接受前一阶段的经验外，还欢迎老教师参加写作。（附图片）
