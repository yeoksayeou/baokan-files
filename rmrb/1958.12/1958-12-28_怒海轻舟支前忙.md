Supporting the Front Lines with Light Boats on Angry Seas

“Old Luo, come and sit down for a rest!” Whenever boatman Luo Bianquan single-handedly pilots his small boat to transport supplies to a certain small island on the front lines, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the island warmly welcome and greet him like long-lost comrades and relatives.

Since Luo Bianquan became a support-the-front boatman in the autumn of 1954, he has won the love of the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the island with his resourcefulness, bravery, and high sense of responsibility. Whenever there are typhoons and heavy rains, when travel is generally impossible, Luo Bianquan's small sampan, loaded with supplies, often appears on the turbulent sea, delivering the needed vegetables and other supplies to the island on time. Even the dense artillery fire of the Chiang Kai-shek troops cannot stop Luo Bianquan from completing his mission to support the front. One day in early September this year, when Luo Bianquan once again piloted his sampan loaded with vegetables through the blockade of Chiang Kai-shek's artillery fire and arrived at the island, he was immediately spotted by Chiang's artillery. A burst of shells then exploded around the sampan, and the columns of water thrown up by the shells almost capsized the sampan. But Luo Bianquan remained calm and unhurried, and he moved all the supplies from the boat into the bomb shelter amid the flying shrapnel before stopping to rest. After clearly handing over the supplies, he used sacks to plug the holes that had just been pierced by shrapnel. Using his skillful techniques, he bravely piloted the damaged boat through the blockade of Chiang's artillery fire and the vast ocean, returning victoriously. A day later, just as the officers and soldiers on the island were wondering whether Luo Bianquan had returned safely, Luo Bianquan reappeared before them with a smile, in his newly repaired boat, fully loaded with supplies to support the front.

    怒海轻舟支前忙
    “老骆，快坐下来休息休息！”每逢支前船工骆编全一人驾着小舟运送东西到前哨某小岛的时候，岛上人民解放军官兵们都像久别重逢的老战友和亲人一样地热烈欢迎和招呼他。
    从1954年秋季骆编全担任支前船工以来，他就以自己的机智、勇敢和高度的责任感获得了岛上人民解放军官兵的热爱，而每逢刮台风、下暴雨，往来行船绝迹的时候，波涛滚滚的海洋上，往往就出现了骆编全驾驶的载满物资的小舢板，把岛上需要的菜蔬和其他用品按时送到岛上，就是蒋军密集的炮火也阻挡不了骆编全完成他的支前任务。今年9月初的一天，当骆编全又驾着满载菜蔬的小舟冲过蒋军炮火的封锁到达岛上的时候，马上又被蒋军炮兵发现了，一阵阵炮弹随即在小舢板周围爆炸，炮弹掀起的水柱差点把舢板打翻了，但骆编全仍不慌不忙地在弹片纷飞中把船上的东西全部搬到防炮洞里方才停下来休息。他把东西交代清楚后，就用麻袋堵塞了刚被弹片打穿的漏洞，运用他的熟练技巧，勇敢地驾着破船穿过蒋军炮火的封锁和波涛万顷的海洋，胜利回航。过了一天，当岛上官兵正挂念着骆编全是否已安全返航的时候，骆编全又笑嘻嘻地用新修好的小船满载着支前物资出现在他们的面前了。（附图片）
