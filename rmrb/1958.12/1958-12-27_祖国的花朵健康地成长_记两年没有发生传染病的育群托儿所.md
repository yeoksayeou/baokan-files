The Flowers of the Motherland Grow Healthily
——A Record of Two Years Without Infectious Diseases at the Yuqun Nursery

On the evening of the 13th of this month, at around 9:00 PM, Lin Gang, a child in the small class at the Yuqun Nursery in Beijing, suddenly had a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. The news quickly spread throughout the nursery. The director, the small class nursery workers, and the cooks all automatically went to the isolation room to give blood transfusions to five weak children who had not had measles, in order to prevent measles. The older and middle class nannies could not come out because of the strict implementation of the isolation system, but they kept asking about the news. Wang Chunlan, the small class nursery worker who was off duty, had spent the day taking apart and washing cotton clothes for three children in her class and had just bought a train ticket to go home and see her mother the next day. Upon hearing that a child was sick, she decided to return the train ticket and work as a caregiver in the isolation room. Later, after a doctor's diagnosis, it turned out that the child did not have measles but rather a common case of tracheitis, and he recovered in a few days.

The Yuqun Nursery is a red banner nursery in Beijing this year, and six people in the nursery have been named outstanding nursery workers in the city. This nursery has not had any infectious diseases for two years. In the nine years since the nursery was established, no child has suffered from diseases such as whooping cough or mumps. The incidence of general indigestion and respiratory diseases this year is only 6%, a decrease of 7% from last year.

All the staff members do everything possible to protect the health of the children. They proposed to love the children in the nursery as they love their own children. Wang Chunlan, who is not yet married, said: "I want to love the children as my mother loves me." This summer, there were a few very hot days, and the children did not sleep peacefully at night. Some children developed prickly heat due to excessive sweating. Wang Chunlan was worried that the children's sleep would affect their spirits the next day, and that severe prickly heat would require surgery. She was determined to find a way to lower the temperature in the room, so she soaked large towels in cold water and draped them over the sides of the small beds, and she washed the floor with cold water again and again. One night, she washed the floor five or six times in a row and also fanned the children, coaxing the children who were particularly restless to sleep outside. In order to prevent dysentery, all the staff members, under the proposal of Communist Party member Cui Yuqin, did not buy snacks outside the nursery for the entire summer. When worker Feng Rongli caught a cold, everyone let him rest in the dormitory to avoid spreading the cold to the children. Zhou Guizhen voluntarily took on the work of burning the boiler and other tasks for him, and the accountant helped him with some odd jobs.

Usually, the prevention work in the nursery is very meticulous. Based on the incidence patterns of diseases in different climates and seasons, prevention plans are formulated. After the beginning of this winter, in order to prevent measles, they gave preventive medicine and injected preventive serum to all children who had not had measles and those who were weak, and they also gave other children three-bean soup and other things. If any suspicious symptoms are found, they are immediately isolated. During the epidemic, in addition to not letting parents take their children home, they also stipulated that nannies in each class should not visit each other to avoid mutual infection after getting sick. New children entering the nursery generally have to stay in the isolation room for three weeks, and the nannies responsible for taking care of these children patiently care for the newly arrived children without letting them come into contact with other children. Washing hands and wearing work clothes before work, and checking the children's health every morning and evening, has become a regular practice among the nursery staff.

This nursery pays great attention to the connection with medical institutions and parents. Since 1955, they have established regular contact with the Beichizi Outpatient Clinic. The doctors at the clinic are very concerned about the children of the nursery when they are sick. Because all the staff members love the children, the parents are very satisfied with the work in the nursery. Many parents actively assist the nursery in doing a good job in disease prevention. If some parents find that there is an epidemic of infectious diseases outside the nursery, they immediately call the nursery to notify them to pay attention. (Attached picture)

    祖国的花朵健康地成长
    ——记两年没有发生传染病的育群托儿所
    新华社记者  沈骊珠
    这个月13日晚上九点多钟，北京市育群托儿所小班的孩子林钢，体温突然高到三十八度五，消息很快传遍了全所，所长、小班保育员、炊事员都自动来到了隔离室，给五个没有出过麻疹的体质弱的孩子输血，预防麻疹。大、中班的阿姨因严格执行隔离制度不能出来，但是也不断向人打听消息。正好轮到休息的小班保育员王春兰，白天给班上三个孩子拆洗了棉衣，刚买了车票准备第二天回家看妈妈，听说有孩子病了，决定退掉车票做隔离室的看护工作。后来经过医生诊断，原来孩子不是患麻疹，而是患一般气管炎，不几天就好了。
    育群托儿所是今年北京市的红旗托儿所，全所有六个人被评为市优秀保育工作者。这个所已经两年没有发生传染病了。托儿所成立九年中，没有一个孩子患过百日咳、腮腺炎一类的病。一般的消化不良、呼吸管道疾病的发病率，今年也只有6％，比去年下降了7％。
    全所工作人员千方百计保护孩子们的健康。她们提出要像爱自己孩子一样地爱护托儿所的孩子，还没有结婚的王春兰说：我要学妈妈爱我一样爱孩子们。今年夏季有几天很热，孩子们夜里睡觉不安静，有的孩子因出汗过多身上长了痱子。王春兰耽心孩子们夜里睡不好会影响第二天的精神，痱毒严重了还要动手术。她决心想办法把屋子里气温降低，用冷水浸湿大毛巾搭在小床边，又用冷水一次又一次的洗地板。有一天夜里，她一连洗了五、六次地板，还给孩子们扇扇子，把个别睡得特别不安的孩子抱到屋外哄着睡。为了预防痢疾，全所工作人员在共产党员崔玉琴倡议下，整个夏季谁都不到外头买零食吃。所里的工友冯荣利得了感冒，大家就让他在宿舍里休息，以免把感冒传给孩子。周桂珍主动地替他担负烧锅炉等工作，会计员帮助他干一些杂务。
    平时，所里的预防工作很细致，根据不同气候、季节的疾病发病规律，订出了预防计划。今年入冬后，她们为了预防麻疹，就给全所没有出过麻疹和体质较弱的孩子吃了预防药，注射了预防血清，给其他孩子也服用了三豆汤等，发现有可疑的病症马上隔离。在疾病流行期间，她们除了不让家长接孩子回家外，还规定各班阿姨不互相串门，以免得病后互相传染。托儿所对新入所的孩子，一般都要在隔离室住三星期，负责照顾这些孩子的阿姨耐心地照顾着新来的孩子不和其他孩子接触。上班洗手、穿工作服和每天早晚检查孩子健康，在全所保育人员中已形成为一种经常的制度了。
    这个所很注意和医疗机关、家长的联系。从1955年开始，他们就和北池子门诊部建立了经常的联系，托儿所的孩子有病，门诊部的医生都非常关心。因为全所工作人员热爱孩子，家长们对所里工作很满意。许多家长主动协助所里搞好疾病预防。有的家长一发现所外有流行性传染病，就立即打电话通知所里，引起注意。（附图片）
