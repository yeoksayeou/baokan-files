    Building the Greater Khingan Mountains by Closely Relying on the Masses
    Li Gui, Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Mountains Forestry Administration Committee
    The Greater Khingan Mountains are the motherland's green treasure. The part within Inner Mongolia covers a total area of approximately 17 million hectares, with a forest reserve of about 900 million cubic meters. Before liberation, the ruling class of old China and Japanese imperialism plundered it like robbers, turning millions of hectares of forest into barren mountains. After liberation, the Party immediately formulated the correct policy of developing and managing the Greater Khingan Mountains, and established special agencies for management.
    The Party's management policy for the Greater Khingan Mountains is to combine renewal and logging, rationally utilize forest resources, and build the Greater Khingan Mountains into a perpetually sustainable forest base for the country. In implementing the Party's policy, we first carried out policies of fire prevention and forest protection, closing hillsides for afforestation, rational logging, rational utilization, and combining logging and forestry in the Greater Khingan Mountains, and made fire prevention and forest protection a regular and important task for the entire Party and all the people. In the past few years, because we resolutely implemented the Party's management policy for the Greater Khingan Mountains, young forests have grown again on barren mountains. Since 1957, forest fires have been basically eliminated, and model banners for fire prevention and forest protection, such as Xiguitu, Ergun, and Oroqen Autonomous Banner, have emerged and received awards from the Ministry of Forestry.
    After the nationwide rectification movement, under the guidance of the Party's General Line, all the employees of the Greater Khingan Mountains, like employees across the country, were full of energy. Wherever the Party pointed, the workers worked. During the Spring Festival this year, it was a period of intense production. In order not to affect production, employees proposed breaking with convention and not returning home to visit relatives. Some even volunteered to work during the Spring Festival to offer gifts to the country. Some workers who had already been granted leave to go home to get married also decided not to go back. In the second quarter of production, the Party committee proposed turning the off-season into the peak season. Employees responded enthusiastically and put forward the slogan "Work hard in light rain, work even harder without rain." As a result, they overfulfilled the second quarter's leap forward target by 9%. After the Party issued the call for technological revolution, the workers contributed their strength in every possible way, vigorously carried out technological revolution, realized the train-like operation of trucks transporting timber, increasing its traction several times beyond the quota; the small forest railway transportation of timber also exceeded the original quota several times; tractor skidding, chainsaw logging, curved handle saw logging, horse skidding, and other types of timber production have all broken the original quota and leaped forward again and again. In their selfless and creative labor, the workers never said they had insurmountable difficulties. The great communist ideological qualities of the employees are making our construction cause advance by leaps and bounds. The timber production target for 1958 has been raised and broken repeatedly, and we are now striving to complete the task of 3.2 million cubic meters.
    In terms of site renewal, only over 11,000 hectares were completed during the First Five-Year Plan, but this year it jumped to 61,260 hectares. Great achievements have also been made in collecting tree seeds. From September to now, a total of over 2,178,000 kilograms of cones have been collected, which can be used to prepare 40,000 kilograms of pure seeds.
    The fundamental reason why Greater Khingan Mountains forestry production has achieved such great results and why the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of employees is so high is that we have resolutely implemented the Party's management policy for the Greater Khingan Mountains and implemented the Party's mass line in the implementation of the Party's policy, and resolutely struggled against empiricism, right-leaning conservatism, and other erroneous ideas. For example, when the timber production plan for 1958 was initially formulated, some comrades believed that only 1.8 million cubic meters could be completed in 1958, on the grounds that only more than 1.8 million cubic meters were completed in 1957. When formulating the timber production cost plan, some comrades wanted to increase the production cost of each cubic meter of timber in 1958 by one yuan compared with 1957. In our work, we constantly criticized these empiricist and conservative ideas. Now, the practice of all the employees of the Greater Khingan Mountains has proved that these comrades' ideas are completely wrong. This year, it is not that we cannot complete the task of logging 2 million cubic meters of timber, but that we can strive to complete the task of logging 3.2 million cubic meters of timber; the cost of producing one cubic meter of timber in 1958 will not be one yuan higher than last year, but two yuan or more lower than last year.
    These facts make us more clearly realize that in order to strive for a greater leap forward in forestry production, we must further mobilize the masses, rely closely on the masses, continue to liberate our thinking, break superstitions, and at the same time, base our work on a positive and reliable foundation according to the actual situation.
    In order to do a good job in forestry production in 1959, we must resolutely and comprehensively implement the Party's management policy for the Greater Khingan Mountains, and transform the Party's management policies of "planting trees with the right hand and cutting trees with the left" and "cutting one and planting two...planting ten" into the actual actions of the masses.

    紧紧依靠群众建设大兴安岭
    中共内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局委员会副书记  李贵
    大兴安岭是祖国的绿色宝库，它在内蒙古境内部分总面积约有一千七百万公顷，森林蓄积量约九亿立方公尺。解放以前，旧中国的统治阶级和日本帝国主义，像强盗一样地对它进行了掠夺式的采伐，把几百万公顷的森林变成了荒山。解放以后，党立即制定了发展和经营大兴安岭的正确方针，设立了专门机构进行管理。
    党对大兴安岭的经营方针是更新和采伐并举，合理利用森林资源，把大兴安岭建设成为国家永续不断的森林基地。我们在执行党的方针中，首先在大兴安岭进行了防火护林，封山育林，合理采伐，合理利用，采伐和营林相结合的政策，并且使防火护林成为全党全民经常性的一项重要工作。几年来，由于我们坚决执行了党对大兴安岭的经营方针，荒山上又长出了幼林；自1957年以来基本上消灭了森林火灾，并出现了像喜桂图、额尔古纳、鄂伦春自治旗等全国防火护林的模范旗，受到了林业部的奖励。
    经过了全民整风运动，在党的总路线指导下，大兴安岭的全体职工和全国各地职工一样，干劲冲天，党指到哪里，工人就干到哪里。今年过春节时，正值生产紧张时期，为了不使生产受到影响，职工就提出打破常规不回乡探亲，有的在春节期间进行义务劳动为国家献礼，甚至有的工人已请准假回家结婚，也不回去了。在第二季度生产中，党委提出变生产淡季为旺季。职工积极响应，并提出：“大雨小干，无雨加油干”的行动口号，结果又以超额9％完成了第二季度的跃进指标。党提出技术革命的号召之后，工人们千方百计地贡献自己的力量，大搞技术革命，实现汽车运材成列车化，使它的牵引量超过定额的好几倍；小森林铁路运材也超过了原来定额的几倍；拖拉机集材、油锯采伐、弯把子锯采伐、马套子集材等木材生产上的各工种都打破了原来的定额而一再跃进。工人们在忘我的创造性的劳动中，从没有听见他们说过有克服不了的困难。职工们这种伟大的共产主义的思想品质，使我们的建设事业一日千里地向前迈进。1958年木材生产指标一再提高，一再突破，现在正在力争完成三百二十万立方公尺的任务。
    在迹地更新方面，第一个五年计划期间仅完成一万一千多公顷，而在今年一跃就完成了六万一千二百六十公顷。采集树种，也作出了巨大的成绩，从9月开始至现在，共采球果二百一十七万八千多公斤，可以调制四万公斤纯种子。
    大兴安岭林业生产所以获得这样大的成绩，广大职工的革命干劲所以这样高涨，其根本原因，是坚决地执行了党对大兴安岭的经营方针，并在执行党的方针中贯彻了党的群众路线，和经验主义、右倾保守等错误思想进行了坚决的斗争。比如，在最初拟定1958年的木材生产计划时，有的同志认为，1958年只能完成一百八十万立方公尺，理由是1957年只完成了一百八十多万立方公尺；在拟定木材生产的成本计划时，有的同志要把1958年每立方公尺木材的生产成本比1957年提高一元。在工作中，我们不断地批判了这些经验主义和保守思想。现在，大兴安岭全体职工的实践证明，这些同志们的想法完全错了。今年不是完不成采伐二百万立方公尺木材的任务，而是可以争取完成采伐三百二十万立方公尺木材的任务；1958年每生产一立方公尺木材的成本，不是要比去年提高一元，而是要比去年降低二元或更多一些。
    这些事实，使我们更加清楚认识到：要争取林业生产的更大跃进，必须进一步发动群众，紧紧依靠群众，继续不断地解放思想，破除迷信；同时，要根据实际情况，把工作建立在积极可靠的基础上。
    为了搞好1959年林业生产，我们要坚决地全面地贯彻执行党对大兴安岭的经营方针，把党的“右手栽树左手砍树”和“砍一造二……造十”的经营政策变成群众的实际行动。
