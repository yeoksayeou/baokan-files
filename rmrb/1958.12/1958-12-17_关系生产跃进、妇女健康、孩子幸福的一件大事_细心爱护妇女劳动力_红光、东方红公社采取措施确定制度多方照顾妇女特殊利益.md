This is a major event that relates to the leap forward in production, women's health, and children's happiness:
Carefully Cherish Women's Labor Force
Hongguang and Dongfanghong Communes Adopt Measures and Establish Systems to Take Care of Women's Special Interests in Many Ways

    (Our dispatch) Chengdu – The Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, cares for and protects women's health, takes care of their physiological characteristics in many ways, enables women in the commune to combine work and rest, and get more adequate rest, which greatly improves the production enthusiasm of female commune members and strongly promotes the commune's production.
    The Hongguang People's Commune is a commune with more than 60,000 people. There are more than 32,000 commune members with labor ability, of which more than 14,000 are women. Since the Great Leap Forward, female commune members have actively participated in labor production. In the previous period, the commune drew more than 12,000 male laborers to go to the mountains to smelt steel and iron and run local industries. Women have become a major force in agricultural labor.
    In the past six months, the Hongguang People's Commune has taken many measures to take care of women's health. In the allocation of farm work, heavy work is generally done by male commune members as much as possible. In the labor combination, men and women are matched as much as possible or the strong lead the weak. In terms of working hours, some women need to take care of some housework, so they can go to work a little later. The commune also stipulates that women have one more day of vacation than male commune members each month (a total of three days). Women with weak bodies generally do not participate in night battles during busy farming seasons.
    In order to adapt to the physiological characteristics of women, the commune first promoted the "three adjustments and three non-adjustments" system for female commune members during menstruation, pregnancy, and breastfeeding, that is: in addition to taking leave, women during menstruation are assigned dry work instead of wet work (paddy field farming); pregnant women (within eight months) are assigned light work instead of heavy work; breastfeeding women are assigned nearby work instead of distant work. At the same time, the commune implemented two methods to ensure their vacation: the production team is the unit, and a certain number of work hours are vacated every day, and the female team members are rotated to ensure that female commune members get leave during menstruation; second, each female commune member is issued a "special card." When a female commune member has menstruation or pregnancy, she returns the card to facilitate work adjustments. In addition to giving a 40-day maternity leave to women who have given birth, the commune provides a certain amount of glutinous rice, more oil, meat, and vegetables to them in terms of living, and the women who have given birth cook for themselves.
    In addition, the commune has also taken various measures to run more than 300 nurseries and kindergartens in the commune, so that women can work with peace of mind. Some production teams have also improved some farm tools to facilitate women's use.
    Since last winter, women in the Hongguang People's Commune (which was then four rural agricultural cooperatives) have participated in field work. However, some cadres and male commune members have some misconceptions about women's labor. Some people believe that "equality between men and women means that men and women do the same work to be truly equal," and some people see that women ask for leave and think that "women are nagging," and even say that they are "stealing and shirking." Many cadres also believe that the task is tight, and taking care of women will affect production. In this case, many women insisted on doing heavy work or not resting. During the most tense spring plowing this year, some women in the original Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative suffered from gynecological diseases due to fatigue, which affected production. This issue immediately attracted the attention of the higher-level party committee, which notified all townships to conduct inspections. Under the leadership of the township party general branch, the original four townships successively held cadre meetings, inspected the idea of neglecting women's labor protection, and launched a debate, the center of which was: "Do women's labor force need to be cherished?", "Will women's health have an impact on production?", "How to arrange women's production?". Through reasoning and accounting, combined with the facts of women's health surveys, the various fallacies were strongly criticized. Subsequently, the four townships successively formulated various systems based on the opinions of the masses to effectively protect women's labor force.
    The care and love for women's health has greatly enhanced women's physical fitness and improved their production enthusiasm. The attendance rate of women in the commune has increased from about 90% in the past to often maintaining about 98%. In the recent busy autumn harvest, with women's labor as the main force, most of the cultivated land in the commune was deeply ploughed more than one and a half feet, and the season was caught up on time, becoming one of the advanced communes in the county.

Changsha dispatch from our newspaper on the 16th: The Party Committee of the Dongfanghong Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has taken many positive measures to pay attention to the special interests of women, protect women's health, and greatly exert women's labor potential. The number of women working every day has increased from more than 7,500 when the commune was first established to more than 15,600.

    This commune, which has more than 10,000 households and more than 60,000 people, has more than 10,000 women with full and half labor force, accounting for 40% of the total labor force of the commune. In mid-October, the commune needed more than 16,000 people to run small cement plants, iron smelting plants, and support labor in other places. Tens of thousands of acres of crops had to be harvested and planted, and a large amount of land needed deep plowing. Therefore, arranging women's labor force became an urgent problem at that time.
    In order to rationally arrange women's labor force, the commune party committee has taken various positive measures to solve the special difficulties of women. For women's work, the system of three adjustments and three non-adjustments is stipulated (dry work instead of wet work during menstruation, light work instead of heavy work during pregnancy, and nearby work instead of distant work during breastfeeding). There are four days of vacation per month for rest (two days of vacation for male laborers). Wages are paid as usual during vacation, doing dry work, and doing light work. If the child is sick and must be taken care of in person, leave can be taken, and wages are generally not deducted for short-term leave. The commune has also established 17 obstetrics and gynecology hospitals with the brigade as the unit. Women who have given birth have 48 days of maternity leave, during which half of their wages are paid. After delivery, the commune provides the women who have given birth with three catties of glutinous rice, 20 eggs, five catties of meat, etc. The commune's maternity hospitals are well-run, with delivery rooms, baby rooms, and well-made meals. The women who have given birth can often eat nutritious non-staple foods such as carrots, Chinese cabbage, eggs, and pork here.
    In order to facilitate breastfeeding for women, the commune established nurseries in the canteens and arranged for women to work near the canteens to facilitate breastfeeding. At present, nearly 600 such nurseries have been established in the commune, and more than 5,000 babies have been cared for.
    In order to reduce mothers' concerns about their children, the commune party committee attaches great importance to the work of kindergartens, and has successively trained nursery workers three times, and sent many party members, league members, and activists to serve in kindergartens. The meals in the 50 kindergartens are also well-made. The children can eat a small amount of meat twice a week, and can eat meat four times a month. They can eat two or three dishes per meal. The children are all white and fat, and they are all innocent and lively.
    In order to solve the problems of women going to work, washing clothes, mending clothes, and making shoes at home, the commune organized a sewing group of more than 200 people, set up mending groups in each company and platoon, and also established a shoe factory. The shoe factory in the Duto Squadron of the Duto Brigade, with 14 women, made more than 100 pairs of shoes in less than a month. (Picture attached)

    关系生产跃进、妇女健康、孩子幸福的一件大事
    细心爱护妇女劳动力
    红光、东方红公社采取措施确定制度多方照顾妇女特殊利益
    本报讯  四川省郫县红光人民公社关心与保护妇女健康，多方面照顾她们生理上的特点，使全社妇女做到劳逸结合，得到较充分的休息，大大提高了女社员们的生产积极性，有力地推动了全社生产。
    红光人民公社是一个有六万多人的社。全社有劳动能力的社员共计三万二千多人，其中妇女一万四千多人。大跃进以来，女社员们积极参加劳动生产，前一时期公社抽走了一万二千多男劳动力上山炼钢炼铁和办地方工业，妇女就成为农业劳动的一支主力军。
    半年多来，红光人民公社采取许多措施照顾妇女的健康。在农活分配上，一般重活都尽量由男社员去做。在劳力组合上，尽量男、女配搭或以强带弱。在出工时间上，有些妇女需要料理一些家务，出工可以稍迟。公社还规定妇女每月休假比男社员多一天（共三天）。体弱的妇女一般不参加农忙时的夜战。
    为了适应妇女生理上的特点，对月经期、怀孕期、哺乳期的女社员，公社首先推行了“三调三不调”的制度，即：月经期妇女除休假外，调干活不调湿活（水田农活）；孕妇（八个月以内的）调轻活不调重活；哺乳期妇女调近活不调远活。同时，全社实行了两种保证她们休假的办法：以生产队为单位，每天调工时空出一定名额，对女队员采取轮流调工办法，保证女社员在月经期得到休假；二、每个女社员发给“特殊牌”，遇有经期或怀孕，女社员即把牌交回，以便调工时掌握。对产妇除给四十天产假外，在生活上公社发给一定数量的糯米，较多的油、肉和蔬菜，由产妇自己开伙。
    此外，公社还采取各种办法办好全社三百多个托儿所和幼儿园，使妇女们安心生产。有些生产队还改进了一些农具，便于妇女使用。
    从去年冬天起，红光人民公社（当时是四个乡的农业社）的妇女就参加了田间劳动。但部分干部和男社员对妇女劳动存在一些错误认识。有些人认为“男女平等，男的女的一样干才真叫平等”，有人看到妇女要求请假就认为“妇女罗苏”，甚至说她们“偷闲躲懒”。而不少干部也认为任务紧，照顾妇女会影响生产。在这种情况下，许多妇女坚持干重活或不休息。今年春耕最紧张的时候，原红光农业社就有一些妇女因劳累而患妇女病，影响了生产。这个问题立即引起了上级党委的重视，通报各乡检查。在乡党总支的领导下，原四乡都先后召开了干部会议，检查了忽视妇女劳动保护的思想，展开一场鸣放辩论，中心是：“妇女劳动力需不需要爱护”、“妇女身体坏了对生产有无影响”、“怎样安排妇女生产”。通过说理算账，结合对妇女健康调查的事实，有力地批判了各种错误论调。随后，四个乡便先后根据群众意见，订出各种制度，切实保护妇女劳动力。
    对妇女健康的关怀和爱护，大大增强了妇女们的体质，提高了她们的生产积极性。全社妇女出勤率从过去的90％左右增加到经常保持98％左右。最近农活最忙的三秋工作中，在以妇女劳力为主的情况下，全社大部耕地深翻了一尺五以上，按时赶上了季节，成为全县先进公社之一。

    本报长沙16日电  湖南省浏阳县东方红公社党委采取许多积极措施，注意妇女的特殊利益，保护妇女身体健康，大大发挥了妇女的劳动潜力。妇女每天出工人数由公社刚成立时的七千五百多人增加到一万五千六百多人。
    这个有一万多户、六万多人的公社，妇女全劳动力和半劳动力一万多人，占全公社劳动力的40％。10月中旬，该公社自办小型水泥、炼铁等工厂和支援外地的劳力需一万六千多人，十几万亩农作物要收要种，大量土地需要深耕，因此，安排妇女劳动力成为当时的迫切问题。
    公社党委为了合理安排妇女劳动力，采取了各种积极措施，解决妇女的特殊困难。对妇女出工，规定三调三不调的制度（月经期调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳期调近不调远）。在休息上每月四天假期（男劳力二天假期）。假期、做干活、干轻活期的工资照发。孩子病了，必须亲自照顾的，可以请假，一般短期的假不扣工资。公社还以大队为单位建立了十七个妇产院，产妇的产假有四十八天，在这期间内工资发一半，产后由公社供给产妇三斤糯米、二十个鸡蛋、五斤肉等。公社的产妇院都办得很好，有临产室、婴儿室，伙食也做得很好，产妇在这里可以经常吃到红萝卜、大白菜、鸡蛋、猪肉等富于营养的副食品。
    为了使妇女哺乳方便，公社就在食堂成立托儿所，并把妇女安排在食堂附近干活，使她们便于喂奶。目前，全公社建立了这样的托儿所有近六百个，受托的婴儿五千多个。
    为了减少母亲对小孩的牵挂，公社党委对幼儿园的工作很重视，先后轮训了三次保育员，派了很多党、团员、积极分子去担任幼儿园的工作。五十个幼儿园的伙食也办得很好，小朋友两天可以吃一次小荤，每月可以吃到四次肉，每顿能吃二三个菜，孩子都长得白白胖胖的，个个天真活泼。
    为了解决妇女出工，家里的洗衣、补衣、做鞋，公社组织了二百多人的缝纫组，每个连和排设补衣组，还建立了制鞋工厂。渡头大队渡头中队制鞋厂十四个妇女，在不到一个月的时间里，就做好一百多双鞋子。（附图片）
