Japan's post-war monopoly capital groups have consistently colluded with the United States. Especially after Nobusuke Kishi came to power, he hoisted the black flag of a "New Era in Japan-U.S. Relations," further selling out the country to act as an accomplice to the United States' aggressive policies. He attempts to use this to obtain economic and military "aid" from the United States to facilitate the realization of its ambitions for expansion in Asian and African regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.

          Tearing off the Mask

One of the three principles of diplomacy flaunted by the Kishi Nobusuke government is "adhering to the position as a member of Asia." Cabinet members of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet also frequently express "sympathy" and "understanding" for anti-colonialism and nationalism to please Asian and African countries. However, the facts prove that it is reliving the old dream of Japanese militarism being an enemy of the people of Asia and Africa.

The Kishi Nobusuke government has repeatedly acted in collusion with the United States when it engages in aggression in Asia, attempting to profit from it. After Kishi Nobusuke's second visit to Southeast Asia, at a press conference held on December 8th of last year, he considered the struggle of the Indonesian people against Dutch colonialism to be an "excessive action." Not only that, but when the Indonesian rebellion occurred, the Japanese government even allowed representatives of the rebels to operate openly in Japan, negotiate arms purchases, and collude with the United States, which instigated the Indonesian rebellion, secretly accepting arms orders to supply the rebels.

In July of this year, after the revolution in Iraq, and the landing of U.S. and British invading forces in Lebanon and Jordan, although the Japanese government said that the Iraqi revolution was an internal affair and hoped that the U.S. troops would withdraw, Japan abstained from voting on the Soviet proposal in the United Nations Security Council demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and British troops. It supported the U.S. proposal to legitimize its aggression under the guise of "United Nations police forces." When the UN General Assembly Emergency Session discussed the issue of U.S. and British troop withdrawal from the Middle East, the Japanese representative continued to play two-faced tricks. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Koichiro Asakai, openly explained that Japan's attitude in the United Nations was due to "our basic policy is still to cooperate with the United States." This is a candid confession. According to a UPI dispatch on July 19th, the Japanese monopoly capital group even believed at the time that the Middle East might become a second Korea, and Japan could once again make a fortune as it did during the U.S. invasion of Korea.

As for Nobusuke Kishi's hostility towards China and his plot to create "two Chinas," it is even more obvious. When Kishi Nobusuke went to Taiwan last year, he expressed support for the Chiang Kai-shek group's "counterattack against the mainland." The fact that the so-called "Taiwan Independence League" or the "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan" can exist in Japan is due to the protection and support of the Japanese government. Hiroshi Nasu, who once served as the "economic advisor" to the Wang Jingwei puppet government and is now the Japanese ambassador to India, shamelessly said in September this year that "Taiwan was part of Japan before the war, therefore, Japan should have a representative to attend any negotiations regarding the issue of this island," and advocated that the Taiwan issue "is best resolved through a referendum." The Japanese imperialists have actually forgotten that it is a country that surrendered unconditionally and has not yet paid off its heavy blood debts to the Chinese people, and yet wants to meddle in China's territory of Taiwan.

Japan also wants to establish a pro-Japanese regime in South Korea. National scum such as Park Chun-geum, who served as a Japanese pawn before the war and was a member of the Japanese Diet, are conducting activities with the support of former personnel of the Japanese Governor-General of Korea. Sawada Renzo, the chief representative of the Japanese side negotiating with the Syngman Rhee group, openly said in Tokyo on June 11th: "The task of Japanese diplomacy is to push the 38th parallel to the Yalu River." Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama also said: "We hope to unify Korea with the strength of South Korea (the Syngman Rhee group)." All of this fully exposes that the Japanese monopoly capital group is preparing to take the old imperialist road of war and aggression.

Organizing a Northeast Asian aggressive group led by Japan to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States has always been a consistent conspiracy of the United States. Especially after the United States suffered repeated setbacks in personally entering the fray in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait, it urgently needs Japan to act as an accomplice to fight in the front. The Japanese reactionary group, represented by Kishi Nobusuke, believes that meeting the demands of the United States and acting as the head of this aggressive group can both solicit "U.S. aid" and facilitate the realization of its militaristic dreams. Therefore, it is colluding with the United States to accelerate its realization. When Kishi Nobusuke visited the United States in June last year, he flaunted an anti-communist policy and declared that he would "permanently abandon neutralism," which was a preparatory step for the establishment of this aggressive group. After Japan and the U.S. began negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty on October 4th of this year, Kishi Nobusuke first made a statement to U.S. reporter Brown that completely exposed the true face of militarism. Then the U.S. officially proposed that the "joint defense area" should include Okinawa, the Ogasawara Islands, and the West Pacific region. On November 4th, Kishi Nobusuke clearly stated in response to inquiries in the Diet: "Japan has potential sovereignty over Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, and I believe that there is an inherent obligation to defend them." Since the U.S.-Chiang and U.S.-Rhee treaties both include Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, a de facto "Northeast Asian military alliance" has naturally been formed.

Lieutenant General Iumoto Kumao, Chief of the 5th Department of the Ground Staff Office of the Japanese Defense Agency, said in a speech in the United States on November 23rd that the United States should form a "strict military alliance" with India, Thailand, South Vietnam, the Chiang Kai-shek group, the Philippines, and Malaya. Recently, former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida also openly advocated in an article in the "Industrial Economic News" that Japan should take the lead in establishing an aggressive group called the "Far East Treaty Organization" in the West Pacific region. This shows that the Japanese imperialists, who are willing to act as accomplices to U.S. aggression, want to tie Asian countries to the U.S. war chariot in order to fulfill their ambition of reviving the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and re-dominating Asia.

          Economic Expansion

The Japanese monopoly capital group, represented by Kishi Nobusuke, is carrying out economic expansion activities in Asia under the guise of "economic cooperation."

The "White Paper on Economic Cooperation" published by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry in May this year defends Japan and all imperialism by saying that the current "economic cooperation" is essentially different from the colonial policies of the past. However, without citing numerous examples, on the very first page of the White Paper, it is clearly written: Japan's "basic policy" for conducting "economic cooperation" with economically underdeveloped countries is, "must adapt to the direction of Japan's economic development, in order to contribute to the expansion of export markets and the secure maintenance of important raw material import markets." It also said that in order to strive to promote the development of Japan's heavy and chemical industries, Japan, standing in the position of an "advanced country," "has a strong demand for exporting capital goods" to economically underdeveloped countries. The "ultimate goal" of Japanese private capital's foreign investment "is of course to pursue profits." To put it bluntly, this is a colonialist economic expansion policy that takes the plundering of raw materials and the monopolization of markets as a means, and the pursuit of maximum profits as its goal.

The Kishi Nobusuke government has always touted its economic expansion policy as so-called "economic diplomacy." The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' "Blue Book" in September 1957 admitted that Japan "in order to develop the economy and cultivate national strength, the only way is to rely on economic strength to implement peaceful economic expansion," which is the essence of so-called "economic diplomacy." And the "Blue Book" went on to say, "Most of the Asian countries have not been independent for long, although they possess abundant resources, they still have not carried out sufficient economic construction. In this regard, there is of course a great deal of room for cooperation with Japan, which has high technology and industrial strength." This is clear enough. In the vocabulary of Japanese imperialism, "economic expansion" and "cooperation" are synonymous, and economically underdeveloped countries with abundant resources must let it take whatever it wants, in order to "cultivate" its national strength, "develop" its economy, and become its sales market and raw material base, and then be further exploited and enslaved by it. This is the logic of Japanese monopoly capital, and this is the "economic cooperation" promoted by the Kishi Nobusuke government.

In recent years, under the guise of "economic cooperation," Japan has used war reparations (the Japanese "White Paper on Economic Cooperation" also lists reparations under "economic cooperation") to open up markets for heavy industrial products in Southeast Asia, driving export trade to Burma, the Philippines, and Indonesia; relying on private investment, it has seized the mining rights to fifteen copper, iron, and tin mining areas, supplying more than a quarter of Japan's total copper ore imports, more than half of its iron ore, and also promoting complete sets of equipment for Japan, saving a large amount of foreign exchange. In addition, Japan has also used "technical cooperation" mainly based on agriculture, animal husbandry, and small and medium-sized enterprises to implement the policy of "industrial Japan, agricultural Southeast Asia."

Whether before or after the war, Japan's trade with Southeast Asia has been in surplus, and from January to May of this year, Japan's surplus with Southeast Asia has reached 149 million U.S. dollars. Japan's annual trade deficit with the United States is in stark contrast to its annual surplus with Southeast Asia. This shows that on the one hand, Japan has become a dumping market for the United States and is in an unfavorable position; on the other hand, it is shifting this disadvantage to Southeast Asian countries. Japan's trade with Africa also adopts a unilateral dumping policy. In 1957, its surplus with Africa reached 400 million U.S. dollars. Only with West Asia, because more than 83% of Japan's total oil imports come from this region, has a deficit been formed.

The monopoly capitalists who conduct "economic cooperation" between Japan and Southeast Asia are all old hands at plundering colonies. For example, the so-called "Big Three" who are actively engaged in "developing" Indonesia are Yasuzemon Matsunaga, Koichiro Ishihara, and Yoshisuke Aikawa. Matsunaga is the veteran of the Japanese electric power industry. He wants to "develop" the Asahan River in North Sumatra to generate electricity, which is the plan of Kudo Hiroki's Japanese Industrial Company, which failed to realize under the protection of bayonets during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. Ishihara was an active advocate of "southward advance" before the war, and his "Ishihara Sangyo Company" monopolized the business of economic aggression against Southeast Asia! Now it is about to make a comeback. "Ishihara Sangyo Company," Daiwa Bank of Japan, and Indonesian private capital jointly operate the "Perdani Bank," which has already opened in Jakarta. As for Yoshisuke Aikawa, before the war, he colluded with the military to make his "Nissan Zaibatsu" the third largest concern in Japan. In 1937, he moved the entire "Nissan" company to Northeast China, merged part of the industries of the "South Manchuria Railway Company" and renamed it "Manchuria Heavy Industries Development Corporation," becoming the de facto owner of the puppet "Manchukuo," and was known as one of the five major leaders who manipulated the puppet "Manchukuo" together with Hideki Tojo and Nobusuke Kishi. Now he is preparing to transfer his position to Southeast Asia. According to the Japanese "Economist" magazine on February 22, 1958, he once said that he personally does not intend to start new businesses at present, "but if it is not limited to one business, but a comprehensive development plan for the entire Indonesia, it can also be done." The true face of Japanese monopoly capital engaged in "economic cooperation" has been fully exposed.

  Reprint of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"

The purpose of Japanese monopoly capital's active expansion in Asian and African regions is to establish spheres of influence. This can be easily proven from Kishi Nobusuke's "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan," which uses U.S. capital and Japanese technology to "develop" Southeast Asian resources. According to the plan, a fund of 500 million U.S. dollars will be established for "development" and the establishment of production enterprises; in addition, a "rediscount mechanism" and a "trade" fund of 100 million U.S. dollars each will be established. Japan attempts to directly participate in the economic construction of Southeast Asian countries through "development" funds, and thereby circumvent the import restrictions implemented by these countries, in order to export a large amount of construction equipment and factory equipment, so that Japan's heavy industrial products, which are difficult to compete with European and American countries due to slower development and higher prices, can obtain a stable market; at the same time, the abundant resources of Southeast Asian countries can become a supply base of cheap raw materials for Japan under large-scale development, giving Japan the opportunity to gradually reduce its one-sided dependence on U.S. raw materials and improve the imbalance of its international balance of payments. And the acquisition of cheap raw materials can also reduce the cost of Japanese products and strengthen the competitiveness of Japanese goods in the international market. As for the "rediscount mechanism" funds aimed at exporting "capital goods," and the "trade fund" aimed at exporting consumer goods, they are of course also auxiliary means for Japan to promote goods and monopolize the market. In this way, when these funds become larger and larger, and Japan becomes stronger and stronger, Southeast Asia will fall into Japan's embrace and become Japan's sphere of influence.

The agents of the Japanese monopoly capital, whose ambitions are fully revealed, even couldn't help but reveal the secrets. Kobayashi, the representative of Japanese state monopoly capital and former president of the Development Bank, repeatedly emphasized that Japan must establish a "broad economic sphere" when he convened a meeting of Japanese officials in charge of economic expansion in Bangkok in late August of last year in the name of roving ambassador to Southeast Asia. Horita Shozo, the roving ambassador to Europe, repeatedly emphasized after returning to Japan that Japan should organize a "Southeast Asian economic group" to compete with the economic expansion of Britain and West Germany.

Now, the Japanese imperialists are not satisfied with this. Okazaki Katsuo, the former foreign minister of the Yoshida Cabinet (now an advisor to the Japan Arab Oil Company, whose chairman is Ishizaka Taizo, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations), represented Japanese monopoly capital in seizing the mining rights of the coastal oil fields in the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone. He said in a speech at the "Economic Club" in Tokyo on September 12 that "Japanese technology and the resources of Southeast Asia and the Middle East combined together" can establish an "Asian-African economic sphere." And he said, "Not only Southeast Asia, but also in the Middle East, there is a strong sense of common identity among Asians, so I think it is by no means a dream to establish an Asian-African economic sphere." Using "Pan-Asianism" to carry out aggression against Asia is a consistent trick of Japanese imperialism, but unfortunately, this hackneyed tune has long been bankrupt in front of the Asian people.

Takasaki Tatsunosuke, the Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, had to admit that "Southeast Asia has emotional rifts (with Japan) due to past wars"; and "also has doubts" about "economic cooperation." He advocated that Japan's foreign expansion in the future, "Southeast Asia is important, but more attention should also be paid to the Middle East" ("Mainichi Shimbun," June 16). No wonder that after Japan signed an agreement in September this year to export complete sets of equipment worth 30 million U.S. dollars to the United Arab Republic on a deferred payment basis, major Japanese monopoly companies swarmed like ants on a bone, preparing to aggressively enter the Middle East market.

However, in the struggle to re-divide the market, it is impossible for Japan to defeat competitors and establish spheres of influence by relying solely on commodity exports. Especially in the context of the deepening economic crisis in the capitalist world, Southeast Asian countries lack purchasing power due to a shortage of foreign exchange. If Japan wants to expand exports, it has no other way but to strengthen capital exports and use capital exports to expand commodity exports. However, according to estimates by the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, Japan's ability to export capital with yen loans cannot exceed 100 million U.S. dollars. If Japanese monopoly capital disregards its life and death and adopts the method of quenching thirst with poison to reluctantly export capital, then the foreign exchange crisis will re-emerge. Therefore, the only hope is still to use "U.S. aid" to inject a shot in the arm.

However, there are also contradictions between the United States and Japan in seizing overseas markets. The United States is unwilling to spend money to cultivate Japan into its own competitor. The United States encourages Japan to expand to Southeast Asia in order to use Japan to seize Britain's position, ease Japan's dissatisfaction with U.S. boycotts of Japanese goods, and dispel the calls from Japanese business circles for trade with China. Therefore, this support is limited. The United States only buys goods from Japan at low prices when necessary and resells them to Southeast Asian countries at high prices as "aid"; or it allows Japan to process surplus agricultural products such as cotton sold to Southeast Asian countries, taking a processing fee and using this as one of the means to control the Japanese economy.

Japanese monopoly capital thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of and dreamed of relying on U.S. capital to achieve its own goal of "developing" Southeast Asia. Since the Yoshida Cabinet, it has put forward various plans, but the United States has been indifferent, evaded, and talked about other things. Kishi Nobusuke and Fujiyama have traveled extensively to beg the United States, but have not been able to achieve their goals so far. Even Ikeda Hayato, the Japanese representative and Minister of State who recently attended the Colombo Plan meeting, believed that it was "too early" to realize the "Southeast Asia Development Fund Plan."

The east wind is strong and the west wind is weak. The U.S. paper tiger has been punctured with hundreds of holes in Asia, the Middle East, and South America, and is dying. The Kishi Nobusuke government has also been beaten to the point of tottering by the Japanese people. If the Japanese monopoly capital group is ignorant of the general trend of the world and unwilling to give up the dream of taking the old road of imperialism, it will only bring destruction upon itself and will not have a good end.

    日本军国主义的扩张野心
    张廷铮
    战后日本垄断资本集团一贯与美国互相勾结，特别是岸信介上台后，打出“日美关系新时代”的黑旗，进一步卖身投靠，甘愿充当美国侵略政策的帮凶，企图借此换取美国的经济、军事“援助”，以便利它向亚非地区、特别是向东南亚扩张野心的实现。
          撕掉画皮
    岸信介政府标榜的外交三原则之一是“坚持作为亚洲一员的立场”，岸信介内阁的阁员也时时在口头上表示“同情”和“理解”反殖民主义和民族主义，以讨好亚非国家。但事实证明，它是在重温过去日本军国主义与亚非人民为敌的旧梦。
    岸信介政府一再当美国在亚洲进行侵略活动时与美国狼狈为奸，企图从中渔利。岸信介第二次访问东南亚后，在去年12月8日举行的记者招待会上认为印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民主义的斗争是一种“过激的行动”。不但如此，当印度尼西亚叛乱事件发生后，日本政府竟允许叛军代表在日本公开活动，洽购军火，并与策动印度尼西亚叛乱的美国相勾搭，暗中接受军火订货供应叛军。
    今年7月，伊拉克发生革命，美、英侵略军在黎巴嫩、约旦登陆后，日本政府虽然说伊拉克革命是内政问题，希望美军撤退；但是日本在联合国安全理事会上对要求美、英立即撤兵的苏联提案居然弃权，而对美国企图用“联合国警察部队”名义使它侵略行为合法化的提案却表示支持。当联大紧急会议讨论美英从中东撤军问题时，日本代表仍然继续玩弄两面手法。日本驻美大使朝海浩一郎公开解释，日本在联合国的态度是由于“我们的基本政策仍然是同美国合作”。这倒是一针见血的自供。另据合众国际社7月19日电，日本垄断资本集团当时甚至认为中东有可能成为第二个朝鲜，日本有可能再次像在美国侵朝时期那样，准备大发横财。
    至于岸信介敌视中国，要弄“两个中国”的阴谋，更是有目共睹。去年岸信介到台湾时曾表示支持蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”。所谓“台湾独立同盟”或“台湾共和国临时政府”能够在日本存在，就是由于日本政府的包庇和支持。曾经担任汪精卫傀儡政府“经济顾问”、现日本驻印度大使那须皓，今年9月竟恬不知耻地说，“战前台湾是日本的一部分，因此，日本应该有代表出席任何关于这个岛屿问题的谈判”，并主张台湾问题“最好是通过公民投票来解决”。日本帝国主义者居然忘记了它是无条件投降的国家，还没有清偿对中国人民的累累血债，而又想染指中国的领土台湾了。
    日本也想在南朝鲜建立亲日政权。战前充当日本爪牙，曾做过日本国会议员的朴春琴等民族败类，正在过去日本的朝鲜总督府人员的支持下进行活动。代表日本和李承晚集团谈判的首席代表泽田廉三，6月11日在东京公开说：“日本外交的任务就是把三八线推到鸭绿江边”。日本外务相藤山也曾说：“希望以韩国（李承晚集团）力量统一朝鲜”。凡此种种都充分暴露了日本垄断资本集团准备走的是战争和侵略的帝国主义老路。
    组织以日本为首的东北亚侵略集团，为美国火中取栗，原是美国的一贯阴谋。特别是美国在中东和台湾海峡地区亲自上阵，连遭挫败以后，更急切需要日本充当为它打头阵的帮凶。而以岸信介为代表的日本反动集团，认为满足美国的要求，充当这个侵略集团的头目，既可以索取“美援”，又便于实现它的军国主义的梦想。因此，和美国串通一起，力图使其从速实现。去年6月，岸信介访美时标榜反共政策，声明“永久放弃中立主义”，是成立这个侵略集团的准备步骤。今年10月4日日美开始修改日美“安全”约条的谈判后，岸信介首先向美国记者布朗发表彻底暴露军国主义真面目的谈话，接着美国就正式提出“共同防御地区”应包括冲绳、小笠原群岛和西太平洋地区在内的要求。11月4日岸信介在国会答复质询时，明白表示：“日本在冲绳、小笠原有潜在主权，我认为本来就有防卫义务”。既然，美蒋、美李条约都包括冲绳、小笠原群岛在内，那么，当然就形成了事实上的“东北亚军事同盟”。
    日本防卫厅陆上幕僚监部第五部部长井本熊南陆将，11月23日在美国发表谈话，认为美国应该和印度、泰国、南越、蒋介石集团、菲律宾、马来亚组织一个“严密的军事同盟”。最近日本前首相吉田茂在“产业经济新闻”上发表文章，也公然鼓吹要日本带头在西太平洋地区成立所谓“远东条约组织”的侵略集团。这就表明，甘心充当美国侵略帮凶的日本帝国主义者，要把亚洲国家绑在美国战车上，以遂其复活“大东亚共荣圈”，重霸亚洲的野心。
          经济扩张
    以岸信介为代表的日本垄断资本集团，打出了“经济合作”的幌子，在亚洲进行经济扩张的活动。
    今年5月日本通商产业省发表的“经济合作白皮书”，为日本和一切帝国主义辩护说，现在的“经济合作”同过去的殖民地政策有本质的不同。但是不用旁征博引，就在白皮书开宗明义的第一页上，清清楚楚地写着：日本与经济不发达国家进行“经济合作”的“基本政策”是，“必须适应日本经济发展的方向，以期对扩大输出市场和确实保持重要原材料输入市场有所贡献”。又说，为了努力促进日本重工业和化学工业的发展，日本站在“先进国”的立场，对经济不发达国家，“具有输出资本货物的强烈要求”。日本私人资本对外投资的“最后目的”，“当然是追求利润”。拆穿来说，这是以掠夺原料和霸占市场为手段，以追求最大利润为目的的殖民主义经济扩张政策。
    岸信介政府一直把它的经济扩张政策标榜为所谓“经济外交”。1957年9月日本外务省“蓝皮书”供认，日本“为了发展经济，培养国力，唯一方法是依靠经济力量实行和平的经济扩张”，这就是所谓“经济外交”的实质。而“蓝皮书”接着说，“亚洲各国大部分是独立未久，虽然拥有丰富的资源，却依然没有进行充分的经济建设。在这方面，当然和具有高度技术和工业力量的日本，留下极大的合作余地”。这已够明白了。在日本帝国主义的语汇中，“经济扩张”和“合作”是同义语，而拥有丰富资源的经济不发达国家，就得让它予取予夺，以便“培养”它的国力，“发展”它的经济，变成它的销售市场和原料基地，然后受它进一步的剥削和奴役。这就是日本垄断资本的逻辑，这就是岸信介政府所宣扬的“经济合作”。
    最近数年来，日本在“经济合作”的美名下，对东南亚利用战争赔偿（日本“经济合作白皮书”把赔偿也列在“经济合作”名下）开辟了重工业产品市场，带动了对缅甸、菲律宾和印度尼西亚的出口贸易；依靠私人投资攫取了十五个铜、铁、锡矿区的开采权，供给了日本进口总额四分之一以上的铜矿石，一半以上铁矿砂，并且为日本推销了成套设备，节约了大量外汇。此外，日本还利用以农业、牧畜业、中小企业为主的“技术合作”，实行了“工业日本，农业东南亚”的政策。
    无论战前战后日本对东南亚都是出超，而今年1至5月之间，日本对东南亚的出超已达一亿四千九百万美元。日本对美贸易的年年入超，与对东南亚的年年出超，形成强烈的对照。这就说明，日本一方面变成美国的倾销市场，处于不利的地位；另一方面却将这种不利转嫁给东南亚国家。日本对非洲的贸易同样是采取片面倾销政策，1957年对非洲出超竟达四亿美元。只有西亚，因为日本石油进口总额的83％以上从这个地区输入，才形成了入超。
    日本和东南亚进行“经济合作”的垄断资本家都是掠夺殖民地的老手。例如，积极从事
  “开发”印度尼西亚的所谓“三巨头”是松永安左卫门、石原广一郎和鲇川义介。松永是日本电力界的元老，他要“开发”北苏门答腊的亚沙汉河来发电，而这是日本占领印度尼西亚时在军刀保护下所未能实现的日本工业公司工藤宏规的计划。石原在战前是“南进”的积极主张者，他的“石原产业公司”包办了对东南亚经济侵略的业务！现在又要卷土重来，“石原产业公司”，日本大和银行和印度尼西亚私人资本合资经营的“佩尔丹尼银行”，业已在雅加达开幕。至于鲇川义介，战前与军部相勾结曾使他的“日本产业公司”成为日本第三位的康采恩。1937年，他把“日产”公司全部迁移至我国东北，合并“南满铁道公司”一部分产业改设为“满洲重工业公司”，成为伪“满洲国”事实上的主人，与东条英机、岸信介等被称为操纵伪“满洲国”的五大头目。现在他又准备把阵地转移到东南亚。据日本“经济学人”杂志1958年2月22日透露，他曾表示，他个人目前不打算办新事业，“但是如果不限于一项事业，而是整个印度尼西亚的综合开发计划，也可以搞一搞”。日本垄断资本从事“经济合作”的真面目已暴露无遗。
  “大东亚共荣圈”的翻版
    日本垄断资本向亚非地区积极进行扩张的目的，是建立势力范围。这从岸信介的利用美国资本、日本技术来“开发”东南亚资源的
  “东南亚开发基金计划”本身，即不难获得证明。根据该计划，将设立一笔为数达五亿美元的基金，供“开发”和建立生产企业之用；此外，将设立为数各达一亿美元的“转贴现机构”和“贸易”基金。日本企图通过“开发”资金直接参与东南亚国家的经济建设，并借此越过这些国家所实施的进口限制，以便大量输出建设器材和工厂设备，使日本因发展较迟、价格较高难以和欧美各国相竞争的重工业产品获得稳定的市场；同时，东南亚各国的丰富资源，在大规模开发下，可以成为日本廉价原料的供应地，使日本有机会逐渐减轻对美国原料的片面依赖，改善国际收支的不平衡状况。而廉价原料的取得，还可以降低日本产品的成本，加强日本商品在国际市场的竞争力量。至于以输出“资本货物”为目的的“转贴现机构”资金，以及以输出消费商品为目的的“贸易基金”，当然也是为日本推销商品，垄断市场的辅助手段。这样一来，当这些资金愈滚愈大，日本愈滚愈强的时候，东南亚就落进了日本的怀抱，成为日本的势力范围。
    野心毕露的日本垄断资本的代理人，甚至情不自禁地道破了此中秘密。日本国家垄断资本的代表人物、前开发银行总裁小林中，去年8月下旬以东南亚巡回大使名义，在曼谷召集日本负责经济扩张的官员开会时，一再强调日本必须建立“广域经济圈”，而当时日本派赴欧洲的巡回大使堀田庄三返日后，曾反复强调日本应该组织“东南亚经济集团”，和英国、西德的经济扩张相抗衡。
    现在，日本帝国主义者还不以此为满足。前吉田内阁的外务相冈崎胜男（现在是日本阿拉伯石油公司顾问，这个公司的董事长是日本经济团体联合会会长石坂泰三）代表日本垄断资本夺取了科威特—沙特阿拉伯中立区海岸油田的开采权后，9月12日在东京“经济俱乐部”发表谈话，认为“日本的技术和东南亚、中东的资源合在一起”，可以建立“亚非经济圈”。并且说，“不仅东南亚、而且在中东也有很强烈的东洋人是东洋人的共同意识，因此，我认为建立亚非经济圈决不是梦想”。利用“大亚细亚主义”向亚洲进行侵略，是日本帝国主义的一贯伎俩，可惜这种滥调早已在亚洲人民面前破产了。
    日本通商产业相高碕达之助都不得不承认，“东南亚由于过去的战争，（和日本）存在着感情上的裂痕”；对于“经济合作”，“也抱有怀疑”。他主张今后日本的对外扩张，“东南亚固然重要，但对中近东也要更加注意（“每日新闻”，6月16日）。无怪今年9月日本签订了以延期付款方式向阿联输出三千万美元成套设备的协定后，日本各大垄断公司如蚁附骨，准备大举侵入中东市场了。
    然而，日本在重新瓜分市场的斗争中，要单凭商品输出战胜竞争对手，并进而建立势力范围是不可能的。特别是在资本主义世界经济危机深刻的情况下，东南亚国家因外汇不足缺乏购买力，日本要扩大出口，除加强资本输出，用资本输出扩大商品输出外别无他途。但是据
  日本经济企划厅估计，日本用日元贷款输出资本的能力最高不能超出一亿美元。如果日本垄断资本不顾死活，采取饮鸩止渴的办法勉强输出资本，那么外汇危机又将重新降临。因此，唯一希望还是想用“美援”来打强心针。
    可是，美日在夺取海外市场中也存在着矛盾，美国并不愿出钱把日本培养成自己的竞争者。美国鼓励日本向东南亚扩张，其目的是利用日本为它夺取英国的阵地，缓和日本对美国抵制日货的不满，打消日本企业界要求和中国进行贸易的呼声。所以这种支持是有限度的，美国只在必要时才出低价向日本采购物资，转手作高价“援助”东南亚国家；或者是将卖给东南亚国家的剩余农产品如棉花，让日本进行加工，拿一笔加工费，并以此作为控制日本经济的手段之一。
    日本垄断资本以为有机可乘，梦想靠美国资本达到为自己“开发”东南亚的目的，自吉田内阁以来，提出种种计划，可是美国却冷淡，推脱，王顾左右而言他。岸信介、藤山仆仆风尘，叩求美国，迄今仍不能达到目的。连最近出席科伦坡计划会议的日本代表、国务相池田勇人都认为，要实现“东南亚开发基金计划”，“还嫌为时过早”。
    东风劲，西风弱，美国纸老虎在亚洲、中东、南美已被戳得百孔千疮，气息奄奄；岸信介政府也被日本人民打得摇摇欲坠。日本垄断资本集团如昧于世界大势，不愿放弃走帝国主义老路的迷梦，到头来只能是自取灭亡，不会有什么好下场。
