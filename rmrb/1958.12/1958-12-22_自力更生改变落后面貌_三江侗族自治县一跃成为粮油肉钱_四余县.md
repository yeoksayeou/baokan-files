Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 21st. Reporter Huang Yijie reports: In the process of implementing the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Guangxi, has broken away from the past reliance on the state for assistance. Firmly relying on the masses and giving full play to the spirit of self-reliance, with the help of the state and the support of the Han people, the county's work has shifted from passive to active this year, and industrial and agricultural production has taken on a completely new look.

This remote autonomous county, nestled deep in the mountains, is home to 180,000 people of five ethnic groups: Dong, Miao, Yao, Zhuang, and Han. Historically, it has been a severely grain-deficient county. After liberation, it still lacked more than 20 million jin of grain annually. Over the past few years, more than 140 million jin of grain have been transferred in from other provinces and counties, requiring more than 400,000 person-trips each year to transport grain from Hunan and Guizhou. Among cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups, there existed ideas such as "minority areas are backward" and "mountainous areas are inferior to plains," believing that the only way to solve the grain problem was to rely on outside support, and the only way to carry out construction was to ask the state for money.

The practice of the Great Leap Forward in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County over the past year has proven that adhering to politics, liberating the mind, relying on the masses in everything, firmly establishing the idea of self-reliance, and continuously revolutionizing are the most fundamental ways to rapidly change the backward appearance of the autonomous county.

On the basis of the victory in the struggle against rectification, the anti-rightist movement, and the criticism of local nationalism, the county's Party organization has continuously used methods of big contending, big blooming, big-character posters, big debates, recounting the bitterness of grain shortages, and visits for evaluation this year to thoroughly break down right-leaning conservative ideas such as the "theory of backwardness in minority areas" and "theory of special circumstances." For example, in the past, people said: "The outside is a vast plain, how can we compare with them?" Since last year, the county has organized more than 100 visits, with tens of thousands of people going to other places to visit and learn, launching a mass "can mountainous areas compete with plains?" debate. As a result, they realized that plains and mountainous areas each have their own characteristics in developing production, and saw the great potential for development in mountainous areas. The CCP Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County Committee put forward the action slogans of "admitting backwardness, changing backwardness" and "catch up with Han areas, compete with plains" to the people of all ethnic groups, quickly setting off a mass upsurge of "three selfs" and "three simultaneities" in production and construction, that is, self-raising funds, self-sufficient in raw materials, self-taught technology, and simultaneously planning, building, and producing. First of all, they raised money and labor themselves for farmland water conservancy construction. After four or five months of efforts by 180,000 people, the drought disaster has been basically eliminated. This year, people of all ethnic groups have greatly broken down backward customs and rules, and for the first time, 90% of the county's paddy fields were changed from one crop to two crops, becoming the first early rice thousand-jin county in Guangxi. The total grain output of the county has increased three to four times compared to last year. Although the investment in industrial construction in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County this year has increased twenty-fold compared to last year, the funds are mostly raised from within the county. The investment from the masses alone is more than 100,000 yuan. In the past year, the county's highway transportation construction has also developed rapidly. Without asking the state for a penny, the masses themselves provided labor and materials, and built a total of 70 kilometers of highways.

Now Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County has become a "four surplus" county with surplus grain, surplus oil, surplus meat, and surplus money. In the past, more than 20 million jin of grain had to be transferred in from other places every year, but this year it can transfer out more than 47 million jin of grain. This year is the first time in the county's history that it has shipped live pigs to support other places. This year's industrial and transportation construction not only did not ask the state for money, but also had a surplus of 5.8 million yuan raised from within the county.

The achievements made by the people of Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County relying on self-reliance have made some "beheading faction" people submit willingly (these people did not believe that the county could become a thousand-jin county in the past, and once said that if Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County could achieve not buying grain from other places, they would cut off their heads), and made cadres and masses of all ethnic groups more clearly see the truth of "it depends on people" and "man can conquer nature." In the future, there will no longer be a need to organize more than 400,000 person-trips each year to transport grain from other provinces. These laborers can be fully used in production. The county can also use the more than 1.7 million yuan that was previously used to buy grain every year to develop industrial production and run welfare undertakings. The emergence of this new situation has made people of all ethnic groups more motivated. For example, this year, when the county planted double-cropping rice for the first time, an unprecedented insect plague occurred when the late rice was grouting. In just a few days, the insect plague spread throughout the county. After the CCP Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County Committee issued a call to overcome the insect plague, a team of more than 50,000 people to exterminate insects immediately went to the fields, made pesticides themselves, and wiped out the insect pest in three days and three nights, ensuring a bumper harvest of late rice. Now the county has implemented a supply system for food and also issued wages, and people of all ethnic groups are beaming with joy.

In order to continuously develop the spirit of self-reliance in production and construction among the broad masses, the CCP Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County Committee has taken the following main measures: (1) Continuously revolutionizing and continuously leaping forward. After a target is achieved, new directions for efforts are promptly pointed out to the masses. For example, after achieving the thousand-jin county for early rice this year, new leap forward slogans were put forward; (2) Continuously using the methods of big contending, big blooming, big debates, big evaluations, big competitions, and big support, so that everyone inserts red flags and everyone strives to be the best, paying attention to developing socialist ethnic relations and promoting continuous leaps forward in production; (3) Promptly organizing visits and holding on-site meetings, humbly learning advanced experiences from various places.

    自力更生改变落后面貌
    三江侗族自治县一跃成为粮油肉钱“四余县”
    新华社南宁21日电  记者黄义杰报道：广西三江侗族自治县在执行党的社会主义建设总路线中，打破过去消极靠国家照顾的依赖思想，紧紧依靠群众，充分发挥自力更生精神，在国家的帮助和汉族的支援下，自治县今年各项工作由被动变为主动，工农业生产出现了全新的局面。
    这个僻处深山的自治县，居住着侗、苗、瑶、僮、汉五个民族的十八万人民，历史上一直是个严重的缺粮县，解放后，每年仍缺粮两千多万斤，几年来，从外省外县调进的粮食达一亿四千多万斤，每年需要四十多万人次远到湖南、贵州运粮食进来。在各族干部和群众中，存在着“少数民族地区落后”、“山区不如平原”等思想，认为要解决粮食问题，只有靠外地支援，要搞建设，只有伸手向国家要钱。
    三江侗族自治县一年来大跃进的实践证明：政治挂帅、解放思想，凡事依靠群众，巩固地树立自力更生思想，不断革命，是迅速改变自治县落后面貌最根本的途径。
    这个县的党组织领导各族人民在整风反右派和批判地方民族主义斗争的胜利基础上，今年不断用大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论、诉缺粮苦和参观评比的方法，彻底打破了
  “少数民族地区落后论”、“特殊论”等右倾保守思想。例如过去人们说：“外边是平原大地，那能比得上人家”，去年以来，全县就组织了一百多次参观活动，成千成万的人到外地参观学习，开展了全民性的“山区能不能赛平原”的大辩论，结果认识到平原和山区在发展生产上各有特点，看到山区发展的巨大潜力。中共三江侗族自治县县委向各族人民提出了“承认落后，改变落后”和“赶汉区，赛平原”的行动口号，迅速掀起了群众性的
  “三自”、“三边”的生产建设高潮，就是资金自筹、原料自给、技术自学和边筹、边建、边生产。首先是农田水利建设自己出钱出力，十八万人民经过四、五月的努力，已基本上消灭了旱灾。各族人民今年大破落后的习俗陈规，第一次将全县90％的稻田由一造改为两造，成为广西的第一个早稻千斤县，全县粮食总产量比去年增加了三、四倍。三江侗族自治县今年的工业建设投资虽然比去年增加了二十倍，但资金大都是从县内自筹的，光群众自己的投资就有十万多元。一年来，这个县的公路交通建设也发展得很快，不要国家一文钱，群众自己出人出材，共修了七十公里长的公路。
    现在三江侗族自治县变成了余粮、余油、余肉、余钱的“四余”县；过去每年要从外地调进粮食两千多万斤，而今年可以外调四千七百多万斤粮食；今年是这个县历史上第一次运出生猪支援外地；今年的工业交通建设不仅没有向国家要钱，就是县内自筹的五百八十多万元的资金还有节余。
    三江侗族自治县人民依靠自力更生所取得的成就，使一些“砍头派”口服心服（这些人过去不相信这个县能够成为千斤县，曾说三江侗族自治县如果做到不向外地买粮食，就砍他的头），使各族干部和群众更加看清了“事在人为”和“人定胜天”的真理，以后再也不需要每年组织四十多万人次到外省运粮了，可以把这些劳动力完全用到生产上去。全县每年还可以把过去买粮食的一百七十多万元，用来发展工业生产和举办生活福利事业。这种崭新局面的出现，使各族人民更加奋发，例如今年这个县第一次种双季稻，正当晚稻灌浆时，发生了空前未有的虫灾，仅数天时间，虫灾蔓延全县，中共三江侗族自治县县委发出战胜虫灾号召后，五万多人的灭虫队伍立即开到田间，自己制造农药，三天三夜就扑灭了虫害，保证了晚稻大丰收。现在这个县已经实行了伙食的供给制，还发了工资，各族人民喜气洋洋。
    中共三江侗族自治县县委为了使广大群众不断发挥自力更生搞生产建设的精神，采取了以下几项主要措施：（1）不断革命，不断跃进。一个指标实现以后，及时向群众指出新的努力方向，例如今年实现早稻千斤县以后，又提出了新的跃进口号；（2）不断运用大鸣大放大辩论、大评比、大竞赛、大支援的方法，让人人插红旗，个个争上游，注意发展社会主义的民族关系，促进生产不断跃进；（3）及时地组织参观和召开现场会议，虚心学习各地的先进经验。
