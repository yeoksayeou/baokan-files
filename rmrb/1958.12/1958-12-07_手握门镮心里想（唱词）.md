Ringing gongs and firecrackers beside my ears,
Members of the commune are moving into new houses, family by family.
Coming to the front of the building, I look and look again,
Walking around, standing still, touching the new walls.
Holding the new door knocker, I lower my head and think silently,
Thinking of the hard-fought times of last year.
At that time, the satellite fields lacked fertilizer,
The seedlings needed fertilizer like people need food.
The south wind blows the green seedlings rustling,
As if saying, hurry up and fertilize me, my girl.
Fertilize me quickly so I can grow tall and strong,
Otherwise, I will have to be thin and yellow!
Mud walls contain fertilizer, which is economical and good.
Mud walls can create fertilizer to overcome the fertilizer shortage,
Determined to dismantle the mud houses and move them outside,
You take the pickaxe, I take the shovel, we push down the earthen walls.
Dismantling the east wall reminds me of my old grandfather,
Who fled the famine, crossed the wall and died in another village;
Dismantling the west wall reminds me of my childhood,
Suffering from hunger and cold, standing by the wall and crying until dawn.
Thinking of the past and looking forward to the future, what is there to worry about,
Dismantle the south wall, dismantle the north wall, tear down the old house!
Salty mud turns into fertilizer and is spread into the paddy fields,
Releasing satellites, each mu yields 20,000 catties of grain!
Lotus flowers bloom because the mud houses are torn down for the seedlings,
Chrysanthemums turn yellow, a great harvest, and buildings are built.
The old is broken and the new is established, everything is changing,
Hardship has not ended, sweetness has come, and confidence is stronger!
Holding the door knocker, I open the door –
Good! New walls, glass windows, and the room is full of sunshine!

    手握门镮心里想（唱词）
    张永枚
    耳旁边锣敲敲鞭炮声响，
    社员们一家家搬进新房。
    来到那楼房前再三看望，
    走一走站一站摸摸新墙。
    手握着新门镮我低头暗想，
    想起了去年的苦战时光。
    那时候卫星田缺少肥料，
    秧苗儿要肥料像人要吃粮。
    南风吹绿秧苗沙沙发响，
    好像说快施肥呀我的姑娘。
    快施肥我才能又高又壮，
    若不然我只得又瘦又黄！
    泥土墙含肥料又省又好。
    泥土墙能造肥战胜肥荒，
    下决心拆泥屋搬到屋外，
    你拿镐我拿铲推倒土墙。
    拆东墙想起我的老爷爷，
    逃兵荒越墙走死在他乡；
    拆西墙想起我年幼时候，
    受饥寒靠墙站哭到天光。
    想过去望将来又何挂牵，
    拆南墙拆北墙推倒旧房！
    咸墙泥变肥料撒进秧田，
    放卫星每亩地二万斤粮！
    荷花开为秧苗拆掉泥屋，
    菊花黄大丰收盖起楼房。
    破旧的立新的万事改样，
    苦未尽甜已来信心更强！
    手握着门镮我把房门开放——
    好呀！新墙壁玻璃窗满屋的阳光！
