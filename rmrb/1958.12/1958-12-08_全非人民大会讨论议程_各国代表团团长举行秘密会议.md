Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 6th: Heads of delegations attending the All-Africa People's Conference held a secret meeting today to discuss the agenda and other matters related to the conference, which is scheduled to officially open on the 8th.

    According to authoritative sources, some suggested at the meeting that several committees be established to address the following issues: colonialism and imperialism; racism and discriminatory laws and measures; tribalism and religious segregation; and the status of traditional systems under colonial rule or in free and democratic societies. It is understood that it has been suggested to change the term "chiefdoms" in the proposed provisional agenda to "traditional systems" to encompass a broader meaning.

    It is understood that the meeting also decided to recommend the establishment of a special subcommittee to deal with the issue of racial discrimination in South Africa.

    Authoritative sources also revealed that the representatives attending the heads of delegations meeting also agreed to delete words such as "non-violence" from the agenda. Well-informed sources revealed that at yesterday's heads of delegations meeting, some representatives opposed subjecting African countries to "non-violence," as this would be detrimental to the African independence movement. They believed that African countries should be free to adopt non-violent or violent methods, depending on the circumstances, to achieve their goals.

    The proposed provisional agenda had stipulated that discussions on the issues covered by the conference agenda should be conducted in the spirit of "non-violence."

    全非人民大会讨论议程
    各国代表团团长举行秘密会议
    新华社阿克拉6日电  参加全非人民大会的各国代表团团长今天举行秘密会议，讨论有关将于8日正式开幕的大会的议程和其它问题。
    据从权威方面获悉，在会上有人建议设立若干委员会来处理下列问题：殖民主义和帝国主义；种族主义和歧视性法律和措施；部族制和宗教隔离制度；在殖民统治下或在自由民主社会下传统制度的地位。据悉，已经建议把拟议的临时议程中的“首长制”字样改为“传统制度”，以使它包括更广泛的含义。
    据悉，会议还决定建议设立一个特别小组委员会，来处理南非的种族歧视问题。
    权威方面还透露，参加这次代表团团长会议的代表们还同意在议程中删去“非暴力”等字样。消息灵通人士透露，在昨天的代表团团长会议上，有些代表反对使非洲国家受到“非暴力”的束缚，因为这对非洲独立运动是有害的。他们认为，非洲国家应当根据不同情况自由地采取非暴力或是暴力的方法来达到它们的目的。
    拟议的临时议程曾经规定，要根据“非暴力”精神来就大会议程所涉及的问题进行讨论。
