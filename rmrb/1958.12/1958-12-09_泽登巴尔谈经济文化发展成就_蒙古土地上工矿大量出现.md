Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 7th:

    The total industrial output of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1957 was 4.5 times that of 1940. In the past five years, the country's sown area has increased by 50%, and 56% of herding households have now joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. This was mentioned by Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, in an article written for the Soviet "Izvestia," which was published in the Mongolian "Unen" on the 7th.

    The article reviewed the development of the Mongolian People's Republic over the past thirty-four years and emphasized the tremendous role played by the Soviet Union's fraternal assistance in consolidating Mongolia's revolutionary regime and economic development.

    The article pointed out that Mongolia previously only had backward animal husbandry; socialist industry has only achieved greater development in the past decade. Now, there are not only coal mines, non-ferrous metal mines, and oil mines, but also railways, highways, and air transportation have been established.

    The article stated that in the Mongolian People's Republic, one out of every six people is studying; there are 1,100 primary and secondary school students, 77 secondary specialized school students, and 62 college students per 10,000 residents. There are seven doctors and nine nurses per 10,000 residents. The article emphasized that the implementation of the Three-Year Plan starting this year will further develop the country's productive forces.

    The article emphasized that the Mongolian people believe that their achievements are inseparable from the consistent and significant support of the Soviet people. In addition, Mongolia has also received enthusiastic assistance from the great Chinese people and the people of Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and other countries in its socialist construction.

    Finally, the article spoke about the draft of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, saying that the Mongolian people wholeheartedly welcome the Soviet Union's magnificent long-term plan, which inspires the Mongolian people's confidence in winning socialism.

    泽登巴尔谈经济文化发展成就
    蒙古土地上工矿大量出现
    据新华社乌兰巴托7日电  蒙古人民共和国1957年的工业总产量为1940年的四点五倍。在最近五年内全国播种面积增加了50％，目前已有56％的牧户加入了农牧业合作社。这是蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记、部长会议主席泽登巴尔在为苏联“消息报”写的一篇文章中提到的，这篇文章7日发表在蒙古“真理报”上。
    文章回溯了蒙古人民共和国成立三十四年来的发展情况，并且强调了苏联的兄弟般的援助在巩固蒙古的革命政权以及经济发展中所起的巨大作用。
    文章指出，蒙古在过去只有落后的畜牧业；近十年来社会主义工业才获得较大的发展。现在不仅有煤矿、有色金属矿和石油矿等，而且还建立了铁路、公路和航空运输。
    文章说，目前在蒙古人民共和国，每六个人中就有一人在学习；每一万个居民中有一千一百个中小学生，七十七个中等专科学校学生，六十二个高等学校的学生。每一万个居民中有七个医生和九个护士。文章着重指出，实现从今年开始的三年计划将使国家的生产力获得进一步的发展。
    文章强调说，蒙古人民认为自己的成就是和苏联人民一贯地巨大地支持分不开的。此外，蒙古在社会主义建设中还得到了伟大的中国人民以及捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国、匈牙利等国人民的热情援助。
    文章在最后谈到苏联七年计划草案时说，蒙古人民衷心欢迎苏联的宏伟的远景计划，这个纲领鼓舞了蒙古人民争取社会主义胜利的信心。
