Deeply Involved in Production, Grasping Production Laws
Zhejiang Shuanggang Commune Steel Plant Cadres Achieve "Three Roles, Four Togethers, Five Do's"

Three Roles: Commanders, fighters, and technicians; Four Togethers: Eating together, living together, working together, and consulting together; Five Do's: Creatively doing, boldly doing, diligently doing, practically doing, and leading by example.

(Reported by this newspaper) The Shuanggang People's Commune Steel Plant in Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, has undergone a significant shift in leadership style through rectification. The vast majority of leading cadres have achieved "Three Roles, Four Togethers, Five Do's." "Three Roles" means cadres are both commanders, fighters, and technicians; "Four Togethers" means cadres and workers eat together, live together, work together, and consult together; "Five Do's" means cadres work creatively, boldly, diligently, practically, and lead by example. Here, cadres and workers are completely integrated. Because cadres directly participate in production labor, deeply involved in the production process, deeply involved with the masses, and lead the masses in improving production as ordinary laborers, the entire factory is full of high morale and soaring enthusiasm. More than twenty earthen furnaces are burning brightly, day and night, achieving normal high yields.

Two months ago, when this factory was first established, the cadres' work style was not thorough enough, and many cadres did not integrate well with the workers. As a result, many problems were not resolved in time, and production was very abnormal for a period. After the commune party committee discovered these situations, it decided to carry out rectification in the factory. They started by focusing on negative examples, emphasizing the praise of cadre Bao Lvshun, who put down the airs of a cadre, was not afraid of hardship, and had a thorough work style, and criticized Wu Risheng, the section chief who could not put down the airs of a cadre, was afraid of hardship, and had a floating work style. Using this negative example as material, the commune party committee organized cadres to debate: "What attitude should be adopted towards completing the steel production task?" After the debate, many cadres received a profound education and expressed their willingness to learn from Bao Lvshun's work style.

With the cadres' thinking straightened out, how to go deeper? At this time, several main leading cadres in the factory took the lead, first going to the large canteen to eat with the workers, abolishing the small canteen; and personally building a simple thatched shed in the middle of the furnace clusters, living with the workers, working together, and discussing solutions to problems together. Under the leadership of the main leading cadres, leaders at all levels moved their offices to the front of the furnace. One night, there was a strong wind and heavy rain, and there was not enough fuel prepared, and some workers lacked confidence in whether they could persist in production in the wind and rain. At this time, the leading cadres and workers stayed together in front of the furnace, and put forward the slogan of "competing with the sky, fighting against disasters" to the workers. Li Hongyou, the secretary of the commune party committee, himself went dozens of miles away and led the masses to transport forty tons of charcoal to the front of the furnace on time despite the raging wind and rain. The exemplary actions of the leading cadres greatly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. As a result, on this windy and rainy night, not only was there no reduction in production, but the output of pig iron increased by two tons.

Leading cadres eating, living, working, and consulting together with the workers, not only boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers, but also promptly discovered problems, solved problems, and timely summarized and promoted advanced experiences, taking the initiative in leading work. The leading cadres of this factory had not been able to solve the problem of molten iron freezing for a long time; after going deep into the front of the furnace and pulling the bellows with the workers, they discovered the cause of the problem. It turned out that pulling the bellows was very strenuous work, and one person's physical strength was limited. If the bellows were pulled for a long time, the body would be tired, and the wind power would be insufficient, which would cause freezing. The leading cadres then discussed with the workers to change the single-person bellows to a double-person bellows, and at the same time mobilized the masses to improve the method of observing molten iron, so that the furnace could always get enough wind power and maintain sufficient temperature. In this way, the phenomenon of molten iron freezing was eliminated, and the life of the furnace was immediately extended from one or two days to seven or eight days.

The commune party committee further required cadres to delve into technology and innovate technology, so that they could be both commanders, fighters, and technicians. Wu Risheng, who originally had a work style that was not in-depth, was determined to innovate technology with the workers and increase production. He and technicians Zhan Maoduan, Wu Hengya, and others experimented with increasing the height and size of the furnace. After three failures, they finally enlarged the original 0.25 cubic meter earthen furnace to 0.35 cubic meters, and the daily output jumped from 500 jin to 1,035 jin. The commune party committee immediately held an on-site meeting to promote this experience. The entire factory quickly launched a technical innovation movement centered on improving the furnace type. In just over twenty days, the average output of the entire factory increased from more than 300 jin to more than 900 jin. Hong Zhongshou, a member of the commune party committee and director of the steel plant, worked with the masses in the Huangtan Brigade to solve the problem of insufficient water for washing iron sand during droughts by adopting water storage and deep mountain water diversion methods, and the daily output of iron sand increased from more than ten tons to more than thirty tons. Zhao Lixiang, deputy commander of the commune's steel command, also wrote a paper entitled "Operating Experience of Earthen Blast Furnaces" based on his own operating experience with the workers.

In order to consolidate the "Three Roles, Four Togethers, Five Do's" work style of cadres, this factory has formulated eighteen regulations on ideology, work style, labor, and learning, as conditions for cadre evaluation.

In other news, the experience of the leading cadres of the Shuanggang People's Commune Steel Plant in Linhai County achieving "Three Roles, Four Togethers, Five Do's" has received attention from the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Taizhou Prefectural Party Committee.

Recently, the Taizhou Prefectural Party Committee held an on-site meeting here with the participation of county party committee secretaries from all counties in the prefecture, organizing the study of the excellent work style of the leading cadres of the Shuanggang Commune Iron Smelting Plant.

The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee has made instructions on this experience. The instructions stated: Leading cadres directly participate in production labor, deeply involved in the production process, deeply involved with the masses, leading the masses in improving production as ordinary laborers, and at the same time, mobilizing and organizing the workers to participate in the enterprise management work, and fully implementing the democratization of enterprise management. This is the excellent work style of the party's mass line, an important guarantee for managing socialist enterprises well and promoting a great leap forward in industrial production, and also the fundamental way for cadres to completely overcome the three winds and five airs and achieve both red and expert. In this sense, the "Three Roles, Four Togethers, Five Do's" experience provided by the leading cadres of the Shuanggang People's Commune Steel Plant in Linhai County is worthy of serious study and promotion. These experiences are not only applicable to leading industrial production, but also equally applicable to leading other construction undertakings. Therefore, party committees at all levels should combine the situation in their own regions, address the current problems existing in the ideological work style of cadres, and through rectification, earnestly promote the advanced experience of the Shuanggang People's Commune Steel Plant and the advanced experience in this area in this regard, criticize bourgeois legal rights views and bureaucratic work style, continue to carry forward the excellent ideological work style of leading cadres at all levels going deep among the masses, going deep into reality, and eating, living, and working with the masses, and resolutely implement the democratization of factory and enterprise management, in order to further rely on and mobilize the masses, complete and over fulfill this year's construction tasks, and usher in a greater leap forward in the construction cause next year!

Zhejiang Daily reported this experience on the front page on November 26 with a banner headline, published the provincial party committee's instructions, and published an editorial entitled "Carry Forward the Three Roles, Four Togethers, Five Do's Work Style". On the same day, the second page also published a special page entitled "Learn from Shuanggang, Surpass Shuanggang, Carry Forward the 'Three Roles, Four Togethers, Five Do's' Work Style".

    深入生产掌握生产规律
    浙江双港公社钢铁厂干部做到“三员四同五干”
    三员：是指挥员又是战斗员和技术员；四同：同吃同住同劳动同商量；五干：创造性地干大胆地干苦干实干带头干。
    本报讯  浙江省临海县双港人民公社钢铁厂通过整风，领导作风大转变，绝大部分领导干部做到“三员、四同、五干”。“三员”是：干部既是指挥员，又是战斗员和技术员；“四同”是：干部和工人同吃，同住，同劳动，同商量；“五干”是：干部创造性地干，大胆地干，苦干，实干，带头干。在这里，干部和工人完全打成一片。由于干部直接参加生产劳动，深入生产过程，深入群众，以普通劳动者的姿态领导群众搞好生产，全厂工人士气旺盛，干劲冲天。二十多座土炉座座炉火熊熊，昼夜不息，做到了正常高产。
    两个多月以前，这个厂刚成立时，干部作风还不深入，不少干部没有同工人很好地打成一片。因此，不少问题未能及时解决，有一段时间生产很不正常。公社党委发现这些情况以后，决定在厂里开展整风。他们从抓对立面着手，着重表扬了放下干部架子、不怕艰苦、工作作风深入的干部包吕顺，批评了放不下干部架子、怕艰苦、作风飘浮的片长吴日升。以这个对立面为材料，公社党委组织干部辩论：“对待完成钢铁生产任务，应该采取什么态度？”经过辩论，许多干部受到深刻的教育，都表示要学习包吕顺那样的工作作风。
    干部的思想辩通了，怎样深入下去呢？这时，厂里几个主要领导干部以身作则，首先到大食堂里同工人一起吃饭，取消了小食堂；并且自己动手在炉群中间搭起一间简陋的草棚，与工人同住，同劳动，共同商量解决问题。在主要领导干部的带动下，各级领导干部都把办公室搬到炉前。有一天晚上大风大雨，燃料又准备得不足，有些工人对能否在风雨中坚持生产缺乏信心。这时，领导干部和工人一起守在炉前，向工人提出“与老天比高低，同灾害作斗争”的口号。公社党委书记李宏友自己到几十里路以外，带领群众冒着狂风暴雨把四十吨木炭按时运到炉前。领导干部的模范行动，大大鼓舞了工人的生产热情。结果在这个风雨之夜，不但没有减产反而增产了两吨生铁。
    领导干部与工人同吃同住同劳动同商量，既鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情，又能及时发现问题，解决问题，及时总结推广先进经验，领导工作取得了主动。这个厂的领导干部过去好长时间没有能解决铁水冻结的问题；深入炉前，同工人一起拉风箱以后，便发现了问题所在。原来拉风箱这工作很吃力，一个人的体力有限，拉风箱的时间一长，身体疲劳了，风力就不足，便会发生冻结现象。领导干部于是同工人研究将单人拉风箱改为双人拉风箱，同时发动群众改进了观察铁水的方法，使炉子始终能得到足够的风力，保持足够的温度。这样便消灭了铁水冻结的现象，炉子寿命马上从一两天延长到七、八天。
    公社党委进一步要求干部深入钻研技术，革新技术，做到既是指挥员、战斗员、又是技术员。原来作风不深入的吴日升，决心同工人一起革新技术，提高产量。他和技工占茂端、吴恒錏等一起试验加高加大炉子，经过三次失败，终于把原来零点二五立方公尺的土炉改大为零点三五立方公尺，日产量由五百斤跃为一千零三十五斤。公社党委立即召开现场会议，推广这一经验。全厂迅速掀起了以改进炉型为中心的技术革新运动。仅二十多天的时间，全厂的平均产量就由三百多斤提高到九百多斤。公社党委委员、钢铁厂厂长洪仲寿，在黄坛大队和群众共同钻研，采用贮水、深山引水等办法，解决了天旱洗铁砂水量不足的问题，铁砂日产量从十多吨增加到三十吨以上。公社钢铁指挥部副指挥赵立祥，还根据自己和工人的操作经验，写出了一篇题为“土高炉操作经验”的论文。
    为了巩固干部的“三员、四同、五干”作风，这个厂已经就思想、作风、劳动和学习等方面订出十八条制度，作为干部评比条件。
    又讯  临海县双港人民公社钢铁厂领导干部做到“三员、四同、五干”的经验，受到了中共浙江省委和中共台州地委的重视。
    最近，台州地委在这里召开了有全专区各县县委书记等参加的现场会议，组织学习双港公社炼铁厂领导干部的优良作风。
    中共浙江省委对这一经验作了批示。批语说：领导干部直接参加生产劳动，深入生产过程，深入群众，以普通劳动者的身份领导群众搞好生产，同时，发动和组织工人群众参加企业管理工作，充分实行企业管理民主化，这是党的群众路线的优良作风，是管理好社会主义企业、推动工业生产大跃进的重要保证，也是干部彻底克服三风五气、做到又红又专的根本道路。在这个意义上，临海县双港人民公社钢铁厂领导干部所提供的“三员、四同、五干”的经验，是值得认真学习和推广的。这些经验不仅适用于领导工业生产，在领导其它建设事业方面也同样适用。因此，各级党委都应当结合本地区情况，针对着当前干部思想作风上存在的问题，通过整风，认真推广双港人民公社钢铁厂和本地区在这方面的先进经验，批判资产阶级法权观点和官僚主义作风，继续发扬各级领导干部深入群众、深入实际、与群众同吃、同住、同劳动的优良思想作风，坚决贯彻工厂企业管理民主化，以便进一步依靠和发动群众，完成和超额完成今年各项建设任务，迎接明年建设事业的更大跃进！
    浙江日报11月26日在第一版以通栏标题报道了这一经验，刊载了省委的批语，发表了题为“发扬三员四同五干作风”的社论。同天第二版还刊出了“学双港，超双港，发扬‘三员、四同、五干’作风”的专页。
