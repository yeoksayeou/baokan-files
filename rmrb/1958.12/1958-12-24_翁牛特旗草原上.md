On the Prairie of Ongniud Banner
By Our Reporter Qin Jilun

In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ongniud Banner is a red flag in the great leap forward of livestock production.

Ongniud Banner is located in the central part of Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia, north of Chifeng City, Hebei Province, embraced by the Laoha River and the Xilamulun River, forming a long, narrow triangle. Eight years ago, on this arid grassland and field of over 10,000 square kilometers, there were only more than 150,000 head (pieces) of livestock. After eight years of arduous struggle by the 210,000 Mongol, Han, Manchu, and other ethnic people of the banner, the number of livestock has now reached more than 520,000 head (pieces). Improved sheep and improved cattle have also appeared in herds on the grassland.

The idea of "relying on the heavens to raise livestock" among herdsmen is a serious obstacle to the high-speed development of animal husbandry. In Ongniud Banner, many farmers and herdsmen used to think that "a lamb a year for a sheep, a calf every two years for a cow" was a matter of course. Many herdsmen also said that the grassland has heavy wind and snow, and natural disasters for livestock are unavoidable. Based on these ideas, in addition to publicizing examples of high livestock production and organizing herdsmen to visit, study, and debate, Party committees at all levels also widely carried out the "double lamb multi-birth" movement for sheep throughout the banner. This year, 38% of the more than 140 sheep in the Fanrong Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Xiangshui Township had twin lambs, and some sheep even had three or four lambs. According to the current pregnancy situation of the sheep bred with advanced technology throughout the banner this autumn, about 25% are pregnant with twin or multiple lambs. The experience of many advanced herdsmen has proved that as long as we establish the idea of preventing disasters and protecting livestock throughout the year, and do a good job in material preparation, wind and snow disasters can be overcome. Last winter and this spring, the Ongniud grassland experienced three major wind and snowstorms. The people of all ethnic groups in the banner rescued more than 23,000 head (pieces) of livestock of all sizes from the snowdrifts, retrieved more than 900,000 jin of fodder, more than 160 ox carts, and also found more than 220 lost livestock. Sangji Zhabu, a Mongolian member of the Fourth Animal Husbandry Cooperative of Hailisu Sumu (Township), was grazing more than 260 sheep when he encountered a blizzard on the mountain. He ran through the scattered flock all night, maintaining the safety of the flock. The next morning, the branch secretary of the animal husbandry cooperative rushed to rescue him. He had collapsed exhausted on the pasture, but not a single sheep was lost. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups have worked hard to achieve the high-speed development of livestock.

In recent years, the people of all ethnic groups in Ongniud Banner, who have achieved great harvests in animal husbandry, have summarized their rich experience in ten characters. These are "matching (breeding), improving (improving livestock), protecting (protecting pregnancy), receiving (receiving lambs), raising (raising young livestock), water (pastoral water conservancy), grass (fodder), seed (selecting breeding stock), managing (feeding management and improving grazing techniques), and preventing (preventing and treating livestock diseases)." Many facts have proved that under the condition of putting politics in command, these ten measures are the important keys to developing animal husbandry.

The work of improving local sheep with fine breeds such as Caucasian sheep, Merino sheep, and Stavropol sheep has made significant progress in the past six years. At present, in addition to the sheep slaughtered and sold, there are more than 26,000 various improved sheep remaining in Ongniud Banner, accounting for 21.4% of the total number of sheep in the banner. These improved sheep have more wool, finer wool, larger bodies, and are fatter, and their economic value significantly exceeds that of local sheep. According to incomplete statistics, in recent years, this banner has sold more than 200,000 jin of wool to the state, supporting the development of the wool textile industry. In order to accelerate the sheep improvement work, a livestock improvement headquarters was established this year, and livestock improvement guidance committees were established in various townships and Sumus. Livestock improvement breeding stations were established in various people's communes, and more than 740 artificial insemination technicians were trained in batches, so that the mass sheep improvement movement was rapidly launched throughout the banner. At present, more than 68,000 breeding ewes of suitable age in the banner have undergone 94.2% crossbreeding improvement, with a conception rate of over 90%. While improving sheep, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the banner have also gradually carried out breeding improvement work for cattle, horses, and goats.

With the great leap forward in animal husbandry and the unprecedented improvement of the socialist consciousness of the vast number of herdsmen, a movement to run people's communes on a large scale in pastoral areas was launched on the Ongniud grassland after this autumn. By the end of November, eight people's communes had been established in the seventy-one animal husbandry cooperatives in the banner, and 97% of the herding households had joined the communes. The herdsmen of all ethnic groups who have realized communization are currently building sheds and pens on winter camps, storing grass and preparing materials, and carrying out large-scale water conservancy movements. They are adopting the basic livestock group system, with satellite groups taking the lead and basic groups as the backbone, to carry out a comprehensive, high-yield, and abundant production movement in animal husbandry, and are working tensely and happily to strive for a net increase of 35% in livestock next year.

    翁牛特旗草原上
    本报记者  秦继仑
    在内蒙古自治区，翁牛特旗是畜牧生产大跃进的一面红旗。
    翁牛特旗位于内蒙古昭乌达盟中部，河北省赤峰以北，老哈河和西拉木伦河南北环抱，形成了一个狭长的三角地带。八年前，在这片一万多平方公里的干旱草原和田野上，各种牲畜只有十五万多头（只），全旗二十一万蒙古、汉、满等族人民经过八年的艰苦奋战后，现在各种牲畜已达到了五十二万多头（只）。改良羊和改良牛也成群在草原上出现了。
    牧民当中“靠天养畜”的思想是畜牧业高速度发展的严重障碍。在翁牛特旗，许多农牧民过去认为“羊一年一个羔，牛二年一个犊”是天经地义的事；也有许多牧民说，草原风雪大，牲畜的自然灾害不能避免。各级党委根据这些思想，除宣传牲畜的高产实例，组织牧民参观，学习和辩论外，还在全旗广泛开展了绵羊的“双羔多胎”运动。今年响水乡繁荣牧业社的一百四十多只羊，38％下了双羔，其中有的羊还生了三羔、四羔。今年秋天在全旗范围内用先进技术配种的绵羊，根据目前妊娠情况，约有25％怀了双羔或多羔。许多先进牧民的经验证明，只要树立起常年防灾保畜思想，做好物资准备工作，风雪灾害是可以战胜的。去冬今春翁牛特草原上经历了三次特大风雪的侵袭，全旗各族人民从雪堆中抢救了大小牲畜二万三千多头（只），抢出饲草九十多万斤，牛车一百六十多辆，并把失踪的二百二十多头牲畜也找了回来。海力苏苏木（乡）第四牧业社蒙古族社员桑吉扎布放牧的二百六十多只羊，在山上遇到暴风雪后，他在散乱的羊群里，奔跑了一夜，维护着羊群的安全。第二天清晨牧业社支部书记赶到救援，他已精疲力竭地睡倒在牧场上，但是一只羊也没有丢失。在党委领导下的各族牧民，就是这样奋斗使牲畜获得高速度的发展。
    几年来，取得畜牧业大丰收的翁牛特旗各族人民，用十个字来总结了他们的丰富经验。这就是“配（配种）、改（改良牲畜）、保（保胎）、接（接羔）、育（培育仔畜）、水（牧业水利）、草（草料）、种（选育种畜）、管（饲养管理和改进放牧技术）、防（防治畜病）”。许多事实证明，在政治挂帅的条件下，这十大措施是发展畜牧业的重要关键。
    用高加索羊、美里奴羊和斯达夫羊等优良种羊，改良本地绵羊的工作，近六年来取得了重大成绩。现在翁牛特旗除宰杀和出卖的羊只外，全旗存留的各种改良羊达二万六千多只，占全旗绵羊总数的21.4％。这些改良羊，毛多、毛细、体大膘肥，经济价值显著地超过了本地羊。据不完全统计，近几年来，这个旗卖给国家的羊毛达二十多万斤，支援了毛纺工业的发展。为加速绵羊改良工作，今年组成了全旗家畜改良指挥部，各乡和苏木都建立了家畜改良指导委员会，各人民公社都建立了牲畜改良配种站，并分期分批地培训了人工授精技术员七百四十多人，使群众性的绵羊改良运动在全旗迅速展开。目前全旗的六万八千多只适龄繁殖母羊，已有94.2％进行了杂交改良，受胎率达90％以上。在改良绵羊的同时，全旗各族农牧民还逐步进行了牛、马和山羊的配种改良工作。
    随着畜牧业的大跃进和广大牧民社会主义觉悟的空前提高，一个牧区大办人民公社运动，今年秋后在翁牛特草原上开展了。到11月底全旗七十一个牧业社建成了八个人民公社，有97％的牧户参加了公社。实现公社化的各族牧民，目前正在冬营地上修棚盖圈、贮草备料和大搞水利运动。他们正采用基本畜群制的方法，以卫星群带头，以基本群为骨干，开展畜牧业的全面高额丰产运动，为争取明年纯增牲畜35％而紧张愉快地劳动。
