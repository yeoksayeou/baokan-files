Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Although laboring thousands of times, this is the first time laboring in the capital. Women Activists Participate in Voluntary Labor in Beijing.
    Two thousand one hundred representatives attending the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference spent their first Sunday during the conference in intense and joyful voluntary labor at the Tiananmen Square construction site today.
    In the early morning, while it was still drizzling, the representatives, holding high the giant red flag of the "National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Labor Army," came from the east and west to participate in the voluntary labor to build the capital. They were warmly welcomed by the staff of the engineering headquarters.
    From 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, the construction site was lively all day long. Steel girls, bumper harvest sisters-in-law, female tractor drivers, female militia members... as soon as they arrived at the construction site, they took off their cotton coats and plunged into action like tigers. Some carried wood, some pulled large carts loaded with more than 1,000 catties, some dug earth, and some transported sand and gravel. They were energetic, full of vigor, and boldly shouted, "The sky is high, but not as high as the ambition of us women; coming to Tiananmen Square to compete, everyone shows their heroism." Girls of the Korean ethnic group from Yanbian, Jilin Province, carried several pieces of wood on their heads, transporting them back and forth quickly. Some representatives from Guangdong took off their shoes and worked barefoot in the mud ponds, as they were accustomed to doing in rural labor. Li Nu, the leader of the "March 8th" fishing expedition combat company in Yangjiang County, who has been fishing at sea for many years, stood barefoot in knee-deep mud and dug mud. Shen Jilan, a famous labor model from Shanxi Province, and six other young women ran like the wind carrying wooden boards. In three hours, they carried wooden boards weighing dozens of catties back and forth about thirty times over a distance of more than one hundred meters. The Hunan delegation of thirty-two people leveled thirty cubic meters of earth in two and a half hours, equivalent to the labor efficiency of ten strong laborers for a day.
    "Although laboring thousands of times, this is the first time laboring in the capital." These women, who have developed good skills through years of labor, regarded participating in the voluntary labor to build the capital in front of Tiananmen Square as a great honor and felt extremely excited.
    Friendly competitions were widely carried out on the construction site. Representatives of women activists of all ethnic groups from the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region challenged their sisters from Beijing, Shanghai, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Before long, the construction site's broadcasting station broadcasted three letters of acceptance. Representatives from Zhejiang challenged representatives from Shandong and Jiangsu, and representatives from Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei provinces also challenged each other, all unwilling to lag behind, competing very enthusiastically.
    Today, the construction sites on both sides of Tiananmen Square were filled with resounding songs. The women activists sang their happy moods while working. Almost every manuscript written by the representatives received by the construction site's broadcasting station was a poem. At the labor site of the activists from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the antiphonal folk songs for accepting the challenge rose and fell, and everyone's enthusiasm was boosted even higher. They sang: "Women representatives come to Beijing, sisters meet and are like relatives, today we come to labor, to build the capital Beijing." Many activists also volunteered to go to the construction site's broadcasting station to perform for everyone, including folk songs, Peking Opera, Shanghai Opera, Min Opera, Yu Opera, Hebei Bangzi, and Shandong Kuaishu, as well as ethnic songs sung by representatives of Tibetan, Yi, and other ethnic groups, truly a hundred flowers blooming, each showing their talents.
    When women activists from Henan, Anhui, and other provinces were working enthusiastically, they suddenly discovered a group of foreign guests approaching. It turned out that the art troupe from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had also come to participate in voluntary labor. At this time, Korean music rang out on the construction site, and the activists surged towards their Korean friends like a tide, shaking hands and hugging excitedly. Hundreds of people held hands and danced together. After the get-together, the Chinese and Korean sisters carried wood and dug earth together very affectionately.
    Today, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Yang Zhihua, Kang Keqing, vice chairpersons of the All-China Women's Federation, and members of the Presidium and secretaries of the Secretariat also participated in voluntary labor at the Tiananmen Square construction site together with the women activists.

    虽然劳动千万次  首都劳动第一遭
    妇女积极分子在京义务劳动
    新华社7日讯  今天，在天安门前的工地上，出席全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的两千一百多名代表，在紧张、愉快的义务劳动中度过了会议期间的第一个星期天。
    清晨，天空还飘着细雨，代表们高举“全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子劳动大军”的巨幅红旗，分东西两路前来参加建设首都的义务劳动，她们受到了工程指挥部职工们的热情欢迎。
    从上午八时半到下午四时半，工地上整整热闹了一天。钢铁姑娘、丰产大嫂、女拖拉机手、女民兵们……一到工地就脱掉棉衣，一个个像猛虎似的上了阵。有的扛木料，有的拉着载重一千多斤的大板车，有的掘土，有的运送砂石。她们精神抖擞，干劲冲天，豪迈地喊着：“天高，没有我妇女志气高；天安门前来比武，人人逞英豪。”吉林省延边朝鲜族的姑娘们，用头顶着好几根木料，飞快地来回运送。广东的一些代表，走上工地就按照她们在农村劳动中的习惯，脱了鞋赤脚在泥池里干活。长年在海洋上捕鱼的阳江县“三八”渔业远征战斗连连长李奴，打着两只光脚站在齐膝深的稀泥里挖泥。山西省著名的劳动模范申纪兰和另外六位青年妇女，抬起木板来奔跑如飞。在三个小时内，她们在一百多公尺的距离内，抬着几十斤重的木板，往返了三十次左右。湖南代表团有三十二个人在两个半小时内，平土三十土方，相当于十个强劳动力一天的劳动效率。
    “虽然劳动千万次，首都劳动第一遭。”这些经年累月在劳动中锻炼出一副好身手的妇女们，都把在天安门前参加建设首都的义务劳动，看成是很大的光荣，感到无比的兴奋。
    工地上广泛开展了友谊的竞赛。来自新疆维吾尔自治区天山南北的各民族妇女积极分子代表，向北京、上海和宁夏回族自治区的姊妹挑战。不一会，工地的广播站就播出了三个应战书。浙江的代表向山东、江苏的代表下了战书，广东和湖南、湖北三省的代表也互相挑战比武，大家都不甘落后，赛得非常热闹。
    今天，在天安门两侧工地上，歌声嘹亮。妇女积极分子们一面劳动，一面欢唱她们的愉快心情。工地广播站收到的代表们所写的稿件，几乎篇篇是诗歌。广西僮族自治区积极分子们劳动的工地上，挑应战的山歌一起一落，大家的干劲也越鼓越高。她们唱道：“妇女代表到北京，姊妹相会是亲人，今天我们来劳动，建设首都北京城。”许多积极分子还自告奋勇到工地广播站，为大家作慰问演出，有山歌、京剧、沪剧、闽剧、豫剧、河北梆子和山东快书，还有藏、彝等族代表演唱的民族歌曲，真是百花齐放，各显才能。
    当河南、安徽等省的妇女积极分子们正在热火朝天地劳动时，忽然发现一群外宾走近了，原来是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团也来参加义务劳动。这时，工地上响起一片朝鲜音乐声，积极分子们像潮水一样拥向朝鲜朋友们，激动地握手、拥抱，几百人拉着手一起跳舞。联欢结束以后，中、朝姊妹十分亲热地一起合抬木料、掘土。
    今天，全国妇联副主席李德全、许广平、杨之华、康克清和主席团委员、书记处书记等，也都同妇女积极分子们一起在天安门前工地上参加了义务劳动。（附图片）
