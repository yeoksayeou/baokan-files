Guiyang Dispatch from our Newspaper, December 14th. This year, Guizhou Province adopted the approach of ensuring key projects, rapidly attacking, and eliminating projects one by one on the basic construction front, achieving remarkable results. By the end of November, the province had completed 78% of the total basic construction investment, exceeding the actual performance of the same period last year by 4.4 times. Dozens of large and medium-sized factories have been fully or partially put into production.

Four of the five iron and steel plants being built in Guizhou this year in Guiyang, Duyun, Zunyi, Shuicheng, and Fuquan, each with an annual output of 90,000 tons of iron, 50,000 tons of steel, and 40,000 tons of steel products, have been partially put into production. A number of newly built and expanded machinery factories are already producing various lathes, gas engines, and other power machinery, as well as urgently needed products such as larger forging, metallurgical, hoisting equipment, and building materials. The newly built Guiyang Power Plant has completed its first phase of construction, and the power it generates is three times greater than the original power supply in Guiyang. The Qian-Gui and Chuan-Qian Railways have completed their construction plans ahead of schedule this year, and trains on the Qian-Gui Railway are about to enter Guiyang.

This year, the amount of basic construction work in Guizhou is equivalent to the total amount during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. Many projects are large enterprises that Guizhou has never had before. However, Guizhou's original basic construction design, construction force, and building materials industry were very weak. In light of this situation, when the clarion call for a great leap forward in industry and agriculture sounded in the spring, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that key projects should be guaranteed first in basic construction. Over the past six months, various localities have gained some experience in this regard. The Party Committee personally takes charge, and the planning, design, construction, and materials departments work together as a unified whole. The ideology is consistent from top to bottom, and the key projects of the province are also the key projects of the cities, special districts (autonomous prefectures), and counties. This is the main guarantee that Guizhou Province can ensure key projects in basic construction. This requires in-depth ideological work, repeatedly criticizing decentralism and departmentalism among cadres at all levels. Implementing the principle of "taking steel as the key link and driving everything else" is the central point of this ideological work. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee personally grasp the basic construction work and conduct frequent organization and inspection of the main measures of basic construction - self-reliance in solving the shortage of equipment and materials, walking on two legs, etc.

As the projects progressed, problems continued to arise. More than 40 key projects were all "marshals" and "pioneers," with large investments and many projects, but with insufficient equipment and materials. Some non-key cement, explosives, and refractory material plants and mines, as well as construction projects and production plants and mines, needed them to be built quickly. At this time, the Provincial Committee re-ranked the key projects and proposed to adopt the construction methods of "fighting annihilation battles" and "attacking in batches and then starting new batches." Construction projects in key areas that were non-productive were postponed, and projects that were particularly needed for production and construction in non-key areas were appropriately advanced. In the machinery industry, more than a dozen key projects were originally arranged. Now, the expansion project of the mining machinery factory has been placed at the top of these projects. The building materials originally planned for the coal mine machinery factory, etc., are first allocated to the mining machinery factory to concentrate efforts to accelerate its arming, so that it can immediately produce.

A tight supply of materials is the basic situation, but many departments, especially key units, often hoard some materials. The Provincial Committee organized a materials clearing committee to clear materials throughout the province, and found a large number of building materials and industrial production materials. Half of the 400,000 tons of smelting equipment needed by the steel plants was solved in this way. For the supply of materials, a method of supplying a portion first and then replenishing it through on-site inspection was adopted; the finishing projects were promptly inventoried and quickly transferred to new key projects. This has made full use of the limited materials.

The Provincial Committee also attached great importance to carrying out mass movements in basic construction work, so that every construction worker deeply understood the significance of attacking key projects, organized workers to participate in the preparation of plans, and enabled the majority of employees to establish the determination and confidence to grasp key projects, attack key projects, and complete them on schedule. Coupled with the in-depth development of the red flag competition of comparing quality and progress, an inspiring situation in which the construction period was faster than the other appeared in the province's basic construction.

    确保重点  快速施工  各个歼灭
    贵州省基本建设战线上打了漂亮仗
    本报贵阳14日电  今年贵州省在基本建设战线上，采取确保重点、快速猛攻、各个歼灭的作法，收到了显著的成效。到11月底止，全省已经完成基本建设投资总额78％，超过上年度同期实绩四点四倍。几十个大、中工厂全部或部分投入了生产。
    今年贵州兴建的贵阳、都匀、遵义、水城、福泉等五个年产九万吨铁、五万吨钢、四万吨钢材的钢铁厂，已经有四个部分投入生产。今年新建、扩建的一批机械厂，已经在生产各种车床·煤汽机等动力机械，较大的锻压、冶金、起重等设备和建筑材料等急需的产品。新建贵阳电厂已经完成第一期工程，发出来的电力比贵阳原有的电力大三倍。黔桂、川黔铁路已经提前完成今年的施工计划，黔桂路上的火车即将开进贵阳。
    今年，贵州基本建设的工作量，相当于全省第一个五年计划期间的总和。许多项目都是贵州从未有过的大企业。但是，贵州原有的基本建设设计、施工力量和建筑材料工业都很薄弱。根据这种情况，当春天工农业大跃进的号角刚响起来的时候，中共贵州省委就提出基本建设中要首先保证重点。半年多来，各地在这方面已取得了一些经验。党委亲自挂帅，计划、设计、施工、物资等部门走一盘棋，上下思想一致，省里的重点也是市、专（州）、县的重点。这是贵州省在基建方面能够确保重点的主要保证。这需要作深入的思想工作，在各级干部中反复批判分散主义和本位主义。贯彻“以钢为纲，带动一切”的方针，是这一思想工作的中心点。省委负责同志亲自抓基本建设工作，对基本建设的几个主要措施——自力更生解决设备、材料不足问题，用两条腿走路等——都进行了经常的组织和检查。
    随着工程的进展，问题不断出现。四十多个重点项目都是“元帅”、“先行”，投资大，项目多，但是设备少，材料缺乏。一些不属重点的水泥、炸药、耐火材料等厂矿，建筑工程和生产厂矿又需要它们迅速建成。这时，省委又对重点工程排了一次队，提出要采取“打歼灭战”、“突击一批再上一批”的施工方法。把重点中非生产性的建设工程推迟，轻点中为生产建设特别需要的工程适当提前。机械工业中，原来安排了十多个重点项目，现在把矿山机器厂的扩建工程列在这些项目的首位，原来计划给煤炭矿山机械厂等的建筑材料，都先拨给矿山机器厂，集中力量加速把它武装起来，好让它立即下蛋。
    物资供应紧张是基本情况，但是不少部门、特别是重点单位也常积压一些物资。省委组织了物资清理委员会，在全省范围内清理物资，找出了大批建筑材料和工业生产材料。炼钢厂需要的四十万吨冶炼设备，就这样解决了一半。材料供应，采取了先供给一部分，然后通过现场检查加以补足的办法；收尾工程都及时清点物资，急速调往新的重点工程。这都使有限的物资被充分利用起来。
    省委还十分重视在基本建设工作中搞群众运动，使每一个建筑工人都深刻地了解突击重点工程的意义，组织工人参加编制计划，使广大职工树立起抓住重点、突击重点，按期完成的决心和信心。加以深入开展了比质量比进度的红旗竞赛，全省基本建设中便出现了工期一个比一个快的振奋人心的形势。
