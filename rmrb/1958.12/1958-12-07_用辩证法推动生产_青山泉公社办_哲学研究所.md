Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 6th. The Qingshanquan People's Commune in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, recently established a farmer's "Red Flag Philosophy Institute."

This "Philosophy Institute" was developed from the original philosophy study group. The vast majority of participants are farmers and commune and team cadres who have only recently become literate, along with a few cadres who have been sent down to the countryside. Over the past two months, the group has focused on the issue of "On Contradiction" and has studied nine topics in light of local realities. For example, when the commune launched a "Three Red Banners Competition," the Party branch connected it to the "On Contradiction," explaining the principles of dialectics. First, they explained what contradictions are, and used many examples to illustrate that being advanced or backward in the competition is not fixed and unchanging, and that they can be transformed into each other; transformation requires certain conditions, and the conditions must be created by people. After listening to the lesson, Chen Fengyuan, the captain of the team that was rated as a "Downstream Banner" team, went back and convened a mass meeting, saying that winning the "Downstream Banner" was a very bad thing. But bad things can also be turned into good things, as long as everyone works hard, the "Downstream Banner" can be flown away. This remark boosted everyone's enthusiasm, and after less than four days of hard work, they really sent the "Downstream Banner" away. Cadres who originally lacked understanding of the significance of the "Three Red Banners Competition" were able to consciously participate in the competition after studying, so that the competition truly played a role in promoting production. The cadres reflected, "We have tasted the sweetness of studying philosophy."

After giving these four lessons, the participating cadres felt that they had gained a lot, and their enthusiasm for learning was even greater. Each time, they were able to select topics based on the current central work and the students' thinking.

After achieving these learning results, the philosophy study group was not satisfied. Therefore, the "Red Flag Philosophy Institute" was recently established, and its own library was built.

### 用辩证法推动生产  青山泉公社办“哲学研究所”

    用辩证法推动生产
    青山泉公社办“哲学研究所”
    据新华社南京6日电  江苏徐州青山泉人民公社最近成立了一个农民“红旗哲学研究所”。
    这个“哲学研究所”是原来的哲学小组发展起来的。参加学习的绝大多数是脱盲不久的农民和社队干部，还有几个下放干部。两个多月来，这个小组已经以“矛盾论”问题为中心，联系本地实际，学习了九个课题。如社里进行“三旗竞赛”，党支部就联系“三旗竞赛”，讲解矛盾论的道理。先讲了什么是矛盾，并用许多事例说明竞赛中先进和落后并不是固定不变的，它们可以互相转化；转化要有一定条件，条件是要靠人去创造的。被评为“下游旗”队的队长陈凤元听课以后，回去就召开了群众大会，说我们得了“下游旗”，是一件很不好的事情。但是坏事也可以变成好事，只要大家努力干，可以叫下游旗飞走。这样一讲，把大家的劲头都鼓起来了，经过不到四天的苦战，真的把“下游旗”送走了。原来对“三旗竞赛”意义认识不足的干部，学习后都能自觉地参加竞赛，使竞赛真正起了推动生产的作用。干部们反映：“这可尝到了学哲学的甜头。”
    这样讲了四课以后，参加学习的干部感到收获大，学习劲头更足了。他们每次学习都能根据当前中心工作和学员思想来选择课题。
    哲学小组取得了这些学习成绩后，并不满足。因此在最近成立了
  “红旗哲学研究所”，并且建立了自己的图书馆。
