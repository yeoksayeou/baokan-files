I believe that the root cause of the division between physical and mental labor is class, the rule of the exploiting class. This is clearly different from Wei Gao's view. He believes that in a communist society, people's awareness will be raised, and they will not feel pain from engaging in a certain type of labor. I think that in capitalist society, people only engage in a certain type of labor due to the compulsion of life, and this labor brings infinite pain to the laborers. In a communist society, people's demands will not be satisfied by engaging in only one type of simple activity. Only doing simple labor cannot give the broad masses of working people true freedom, not only material freedom but also spiritual freedom. At the same time, it is unfair to let a few people monopolize theory and the broad masses of people only be scientific laymen. Is it reasonable not to participate in the production of material goods and to share the fruits of other people's labor? Comrade Wei Gao defends this unearned gain by saying: "It is to give play to people's greater role." This first shows that Wei Gao does not have a correct understanding of who, the wisdom of the broad masses of working people or the wisdom of a small number of people, can play a greater role in society. On the other hand, he does not have enough understanding of communist society. He did not see that communism is built on the basis of highly developed scientific culture, scientific achievements, and social productive forces.

In a communist society, due to the high development of scientific culture and social productive forces, everyone only spends a small part of their time engaging in the production of material goods. This kind of productive labor has become people's conscious habit due to the improvement of people's awareness. People are happy to participate in this kind of labor and regard this labor as a necessity of life. Most of the rest of the time, people will use it to engage in various scientific research, artistic activities, sports activities, and social activities according to their interests and hobbies. At that time, exploring the secrets of outer space or engaging in other deeper scientific research will surely be the most attractive work, and will surely arouse people's joint efforts. (This is the case now. It's just that the broad masses of people do not have enough knowledge or have very little knowledge, so they can't do this, and only a small number of intellectuals are engaged in this work.) Therefore, there is no need for specialized mental laborers—knowledgeable "genius" figures—to specialize in this work or guide this work, and the broad masses of people will be able to naturally engage in this work and develop rapidly along the correct path. In my opinion, this work is completed and developed at the greatest speed (a speed that individual "genius" cannot achieve) on the basis of people's joint cooperation, joint research, joint efforts, and through the widest range of debates. This can be seen from the earth-shattering achievements created by the Great Leap Forward of the people across the country. But this is still the case when the broad masses of people have very little culture or some are completely illiterate. Then it is conceivable that in a communist society, when science and technology are universally highly developed and everyone has a high level of education, wouldn't even more amazing miracles be created?

In a communist society, the collective creativity of the masses will be the most "genius", and this "genius" will be a "genius" above "genius" that the current individual "genius" cannot compare with.

What exactly is the so-called current individual "genius"? A scientist said it well: "Genius is due to accumulation, intelligence lies in learning." I think this is exactly the case. The so-called "genius" is the embodiment of the accumulation of the wisdom of the broad masses in a certain individual. Therefore, it also has a certain class nature. Take the "genius" in capitalist society, what kind of "genius" is this? Originally, this "genius" is shown when a small number of privileged people monopolize knowledge and the broad masses of working people suffer from the cruel exploitation of capital and lose the opportunity to study, and "genius" is buried. This small number of intellectuals call themselves superior "geniuses". But how can their "genius" be compared with the real "genius" in communist society? In a communist society, where everyone has a high level of culture, wouldn't the collective discussion of problems by people be more effective than the individual study of a small number of people, gnawing on books, and exploring a certain problem until they are dizzy? Wouldn't it seem more "genius"? Therefore, only in a communist society can the broad masses of people freely and happily give full play to their greatest "genius". In capitalist society, not only is the genius of the broad masses of people buried, but even this small number of so-called "genius" figures cannot freely and happily engage in their own careers. Of course, in a communist society, some people will be stronger than others in this regard (this is the so-called top-notch genius), but this is not a decisive factor for the entire society. If in capitalist society the role of a certain person in scientific work is still very prominent due to the lack of culture of the broad masses of people, then in communist society, due to the universal improvement of people's culture, it no longer plays this role. Because what people are engaged in at this time will inevitably be a huge cause that cannot be completed by individuals. Therefore, the role of the individual can only be a prompting role, and the entire cause must be completed collectively by the broad masses of people. Here, the role of the broad masses of people is decisive. At the same time, this so-called top-notch "genius" does not necessarily have to be separated from physical labor (productive labor) that only takes a small amount of time. Moreover, this top-notch genius is not necessarily the kind of person who only engages in mental labor and does not engage in direct material production labor?

In summary, in a communist society, everyone will consciously participate in the labor of direct material production, without any social coercion. Everyone will also engage in various scientific research, artistic activities, etc., which will be the most reasonable and effective way to use labor. The difference between mental labor and physical labor should be completely eliminated, and it must be eliminated.

Comrade Wei Gao proposed that financial, transportation, and other undertakings have to be managed by specialized mental laborers. This cannot be the scenario of a communist society. In a communist society, there is no need for commodities and currency to exist. Various goods are exchanged with each other only according to their use value. The currently very complicated financial and transportation work will become simple work that everyone can do, without the need for specialized mental laborers.

In a communist society, due to the realization of production automation, the difference between mental labor and physical labor is fundamentally eliminated even in the simple production of material goods.

    未来的劳动和天才
    宁学忠
    我认为，造成体力劳动和脑力劳动分工的根源，是阶级，是剥削阶级的统治。这和魏高的看法显然不同。他认为在共产主义社会里人们由于觉悟提高，就不会因为从事一种劳动而感到痛苦。我以为，在资本主义社会里人们只从事某一种劳动，是由于生活的逼迫，这种劳动给劳动者带来了无限的痛苦。而在共产主义社会里，人们的要求是不会以从事某一种单纯的活动为满足的。只做单纯的劳动不能使广大的劳动人民得到真正的，不仅是物质上的、而且是精神上的自由。同时，只让少数人垄断理论，广大人民只做科学门外汉，这是不公平的。难道不参加物质资料的生产而分得别人的劳动成果是合理的吗？魏高同学为这种不劳而获做辩解说：“是为了发挥人们更大的作用”；这首先说明了魏高对广大劳动人民的智慧和一少部分人的智慧究竟两者谁对社会能起更大作用没有正确了解。另一方面，他对共产主义社会了解得也不够。他没看到共产主义是建立在科学文化，科学成就和社会生产力高度发达的基础上的。
    在共产主义社会里，由于科学文化和社会生产力的高度发展，每个人只用很少的一部分时间去从事物质资料的生产。这种生产劳动由于人们觉悟的提高，已经成为人们的自觉习惯。人们都以自己参加这种劳动而感到快乐，都把这种劳动看成是生活的必需。而其余的大部分时间，人们将根据自己的兴趣、爱好，用来从事各种科学研究、艺术活动和体育活动以及社交等等。那时，探索宇宙空间的秘密或从事其他更深的科学研究工作，必将是最吸引人的工作，必将引起人们的共同努力。（就是现在也如此。只是广大的人民还没有足够的知识或很少有知识，所以没法这样做，只让少数的知识者从事了这种工作。）因此在这里也就用不着什么专门的脑力劳动者——有知识的“天才”人物——来专门从事这种工作或指导这种工作，而广大人民就已经能够自然地从事这种工作，并且沿着正确的道路迅速地向前发展。依我的看法，这种工作是在人们共同协作的基础上，共同研究，共同努力，并通过最广泛的争论用最大的速度（这种速度是个人“天才”所无法得到的）来完成和向前发展的。这只要从现在全国人民的大跃进所创造的惊天动地的成果上就可以看出。但这还是在广大人民只有很少的文化或有的根本还不识字的情况下。那么可想而知，到了共产主义社会，在科学技术普遍高度发展，人人都有很高的文化程度的情况下，不是更会创造出更加惊人的奇迹吗？
    在共产主义社会里，人民大众的集体创造力将是最“天才”的，这种“天才”将是现在的个人“天才”无法相比的“天才”之上的“天才”。
    所谓现在的个人“天才”究竟是什么呢？有一位科学家说的好：“天才由于积累，聪明在于学习。”我认为正是这样。所谓“天才”，就是广大群众智慧的积累在某个别人身上的体现。因此它也有一定的阶级性。就拿资本主义社会里的“天才”来说吧，这种“天才”究竟算是什么“天才”呢？原来，这种“天才”是少数的特权人物垄断了知识而在广大劳动人民忍受资本残酷剥削而丧失了学习机会，“天才”被埋没了的时候而显示出来的。这一少部分知识者自称为高人一等的“天才”。可是他们的这种“天才”跟共产主义社会里的真正的“天才”相比，又能算得了什么呢？难道在共产主义社会里人人都有高度文化，人们对问题的集体讨论，不会比这仅仅一少部人分散地在那里个人钻研，啃书本，累得昏头胀脑地探索某一问题能获得更大的效果吗？不会更显得“天才”吗？因此，只有在共产主义社会里，广大人民才能自由地、快乐地发挥他们的最大“天才”。而在资本主义社会里，不但广大人民的天才被埋没了，就连这一少部分号称“天才”的人物也不能是自由地快乐地从事他们自己的事业。当然，在共产主义社会也会有的人比一般人在这方面会强些（这就是所谓的拔尖天才），但这对整个社会而言并不是起决定性作用的因素。如果说在资本主义社会里由于广大人民没有文化，某个人在科学工作上的作用还很突出的话，那么，在共产主义社会里，由于人们的文化普遍提高，它已不再起这种作用。因为这时候人们所从事的必将是巨大的为个人所不能完成的事业。因此个人的作用也只能是提示的作用，而整个的事业还得广大人民集体来完成。在这里，广大人民的作用是决定性的。同时，这种所谓的拔尖“天才”也并不一定非得脱离只要很少时间的体力劳动（生产劳动）不可。更何况这种拔尖天才也并不一定是那种只从事脑力劳动而不从事直接物质资料生产劳动的人呢？
    总括说来，在共产主义社会里每个人都会自觉参加直接物质资料生产的劳动，而不需要任何社会上的强迫。人人也都从事各项科学研究、艺术活动等，将是最合理最有效地利用劳动力的办法。脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别完全应该被消灭，也一定能消灭。
    魏高同学提出，财政、交通运输等事业不得不由专门的脑力劳动者来从事管理。这不能成为共产主义社会的情景。在共产主义社会里，商品货币没有存在的必要了，各种物品只按其使用价值互相交换，现在很复杂的财政和交通运输等工作就变成所有的人都可胜任的简单工作，用不着什么专门的脑力劳动者。
    在共产主义社会里，由于实现了生产自动化，就是在单纯的物质资料生产上也根本消灭了脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。
