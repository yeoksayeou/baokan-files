Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 14th: "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial today welcoming the TASS statement on the West Berlin issue.

The editorial said that when Western leaders said "no" to the Soviet government's note, their own people did not agree with their opinions. The task now should be to eliminate the dangerous hotbed threatening the people of all countries.

The editorial pointed out that the TASS statement once again emphasized the Soviet government's willingness to work with other countries to ensure that West Berlin becomes a demilitarized free city, which shows that the Soviet Union has no other purpose in West Berlin than peace and normalization of relations.

The editorial condemned the Bonn government's attempt to remove the West Berlin issue from the negotiating table, saying that West German militarists need the occupation status of West Berlin just as Hitler needed the fifth column in Poland and Czechoslovakia, but the negotiation of the West Berlin issue does not depend on Bonn; it must be resolved through negotiations.

The editorial also pointed out that if the upcoming NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Paris still attempts to make a decision to unify Germany by force, it would be purely futile. It said that the TASS statement pointed out that if the German Democratic Republic is attacked, other Warsaw Pact member states will certainly fulfill their obligations.

Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, TASS, Bonn: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's conversation with the reporter of the Munich newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung" and the TASS statement on the Berlin issue have become the center of attention for Bonn politicians and the entire West German public.

West German officials and West German political parties have made preliminary comments on the two documents. A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman, when speaking on the above two Soviet documents, completely distorted the meaning of the conversation and the statement. He even said that the Soviet position "approaches a threat of war."

The right-wing leadership group of the West German Social Democratic Party still maintains a reserved negative attitude towards the Soviet proposal on the Berlin status quo.

On the 13th, West German newspapers paid great attention to the above two Soviet documents.

"Süddeutsche Zeitung" said in an editorial: "Khrushchev's answers to the newspaper's five questions are of great significance because they discuss his views on the free city in more detail for the first time." The newspaper called on Western countries to put forward responsive proposals without delay.

"Neue Rhein Zeitung" wrote: "One thing is very clear. We cannot simply avoid Khrushchev's conversation with the 'Süddeutsche Zeitung,' and almost equally cannot avoid the TASS statement."

    “新德意志报”欢迎塔斯社声明
    西柏林问题一定要通过谈判解决
    苏联两个文件已成当前西德公众注意中心
    新华社柏林14日电  “新德意志报”今天发表社论欢迎塔斯社关于西柏林问题的声明。
    社论说，当西方国家领导人对苏联政府照会说“不”的时候，他们本国人民并不同意他们的意见。现在的任务应该是：消除威胁各国人民的危险策源地。
    社论指出，塔斯社的声明再次强调苏联政府准备同其他国家一道，保证西柏林成为非军事自由城市，这表明，苏联在西柏林并无其他目的，只是为了和平和使关系正常化。
    社论谴责波恩政府企图把西柏林问题从谈判桌上取消，它说，西德军国主义者需要西柏林的占领状态，就像希特勒需要在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的第五纵队一样，但是西柏林问题的谈判并不取决于波恩，它是一定要通过谈判来解决的。
    社论还指出，如果即将在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织外长会议仍然企图做出用武力来统一德国的决议的话，那纯粹是徒费心机。它说，塔斯社的声明指出，如果民主德国遭到攻击，华沙条约的其他参加国一定履行其义务。
    新华社14日讯  据塔斯社波恩讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对慕尼黑报纸“南德意志报”记者的谈话和塔斯社关于柏林问题的声明，这两个文件成了波恩政界人士和西德全体公众注意的中心。
    西德官方人士和西德各政党都对这两个文件进行了初步的评论。西德外交部发言人在就苏联上述两个文件发言时，完全歪曲了谈话和声明中的意思。他甚至说：苏联的立场“接近于进行战争威胁”。
    西德社会民主党右翼领导集团对待苏联关于柏林现状问题的建议仍然采取有保留的否定态度。
    13日西德各报都对苏联的上述两个文件给予了极大的注意。
    “南德意志报”在社论中说：“赫鲁晓夫对报纸的五个问题的答复有很大意义，因为其中第一次比较详细地谈到了他对自由城市的看法。”报纸呼吁西方国家毫不拖延地提出答复性的建议。
    “新莱因报”写道：“有一点很清楚。我们不能简单地回避赫鲁晓夫对‘南德意志报’的谈话，几乎同样不能回避塔斯社的声明。”（附图片）
    11月27日，自由德国青年联盟的盟员在西柏林举行示威游行，欢迎苏联建议把西柏林变成非军事化自由城市。上面的标语牌上写着：“为了没有占领的自由的柏林而斗争”。下面的标语牌上写着：“和德国统一社会党一起反对西德原子武装”。  德意志通讯社稿（新华社发）
