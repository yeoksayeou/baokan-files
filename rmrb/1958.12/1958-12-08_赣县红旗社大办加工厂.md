    Ganxian Hongqi Commune Vigorously Runs Processing Plants
    (Our report) The Hongqi Commune in Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, is building a large reservoir this winter to irrigate 40,000 mu of land, and more than ten small reservoirs to irrigate about 10,000 mu each. This requires more than 300 tons of cement, 5 tons of explosives, and many iron and wood tools. However, the state can only supply a small amount of iron and wood tools, and not a single catty of cement or explosives. Other aspects also have this phenomenon.
    After the Commune Party Committee promptly studied this situation, it decided to solve the problem itself. Subsequently, the Party Committee immediately took measures, first making a comprehensive arrangement of the entire commune's labor force, and transferring 869 people to run factories. The first factories to be established were cement, explosives, farm tools, and fertilizer plants. Then, various professional groups were formed according to the projects to be responsible for them. All equipment followed the principle of making use of existing conditions, and factory buildings utilized old ancestral halls and temples. Tools were made domestically instead of relying on foreign imports, and they were manufactured themselves. In this way, from late October to now, in just over a month, they have successively established 118 factories. Many things that were originally considered difficult to produce have been produced. For example, cement and explosives were originally thought to be impossible to manufacture due to lack of equipment and technology. After the professional groups studied, visited, worked hard, and experimented, they modified lime kilns and used a local clay as raw material, finally producing low-grade and medium-grade cement. The three cement plants and one explosives plant that have been built can now produce 100 tons of cement and 500 jin of explosives per day. In the past, commune members did not understand the composition of chemical fertilizers, but now they have established more than 20 indigenous fertilizer plants, which can produce more than ten kinds of indigenous fertilizers. The farm tool repair and assembly plant can not only produce simple iron and wood farm tools, but recently also created an improved deep plowing plow that is urgently needed for deep plowing.

    赣县红旗社大办加工厂
    本报讯  江西省赣县红旗公社今冬兴修一个灌溉四万亩田的大水库和十多个灌溉万亩左右的小型水库，需要三百多吨水泥、五吨炸药和许多铁木工具，而国家除能供应少量的铁木工具外，水泥和炸药一斤都没有。其他方面也有这种现象。
    这个公社党委会及时研究了这种情况以后，决定自己解决。接着党委会立即采取了措施，首先将全社劳动力进行了全面安排，抽调八百六十九人办工厂。首先兴办的有水泥、炸药、农具、化肥等厂。然后，分别项目组成了各种专业组分别负责。各项设备，按照因陋就简原则，厂房是利用旧有的祠堂、庙宇，工具是以土代洋，自己制造。这样，他们从10月下旬到现在，仅一个多月的时间，即先后办起了一百一十八个工厂。许多原来认为制作困难的东西都生产出来了。如水泥和炸药，原来认为无设备、无技术，制造不出来。经过专业组学习访问，刻苦钻研和试验，将石灰窑改装以后，用本地的一种粘土作原料，终于烧制出了低标号和中标号水泥。现在已建成的三个水泥厂和一个炸药厂，每天能生产一百吨水泥和五百斤炸药。社员们过去不懂得化肥的成份，现在他们办起了二十多个土化肥厂，能制造出十多种土化肥。农具修配厂不仅能生产简单的铁、木农具，最近还创制了一种当前深耕急需的改良深耕犁。
