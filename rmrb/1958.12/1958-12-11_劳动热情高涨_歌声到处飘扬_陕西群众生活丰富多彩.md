    High Labor Enthusiasm
    Songs Everywhere
    Shaanxi People's Life Rich and Colorful

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the realization of collectivized living in various parts of Shaanxi Province, the lives of the masses have become more colorful, and songs and laughter praising the goodness of the socialist system can be heard everywhere; the enthusiasm of the commune members for labor has been even higher, and field management and water conservancy projects have been done very well.
    In the Shaanbei and Guanzhong areas, in addition to making the food plentiful and fragrant, the canteens of the people's communes generally kept a certain number of cooking utensils for the commune members' families, so that the commune members could take rice and flour back to cook themselves when necessary. Many people's communes throughout the province have set up small shops in their canteens where commune members can buy freely.
    Winter has arrived. The sewing departments of people's communes in various places are actively preparing winter clothing for the masses. The winter clothes sewn by the sewing department of the Lintong County People's Commune for the commune members are not only novel in style but also save on materials, are tightly stitched, and are delivered early. The Jiacun Brigade of the Jiacun People's Commune in Baoji County also distributed sixty-three sets of new cotton clothes to single men, the "five guarantees" households, and families with many children.
    Because of the large scale and manpower of the people's communes, it has also brought very favorable conditions for carrying out mass recreational activities.
    The masses in the Guanzhong area have formed many small theatrical troupes or amateur music bands, which perform every evening or on public holidays. He Zhifang, a housewife from the Weiqu People's Commune in Chang'an County who just shed her illiteracy, has written thousands of poems since the great leap forward in agricultural production and has put her poems in paper-cuts, so that there are paintings in the poems and poems in the paintings. Recently, she sent the paper-cut poems she had cut to the beloved Chairman Mao. Wang Yishan's wife, seventy-two years old, from the Red People's Commune in Xi'an, filled her yard with paintings.
    Sports activities of Shaanxi farmers have also developed vigorously. According to incomplete statistics from the three counties of Dali, Lantian, and Ankang alone, there are 3,372 sports teams of various types. The companies and platoons of the People's Commune in Ankang County have sports grounds. Many companies and platoons in the People's Communes in the Hanzhong area often hold sports activities such as high jump, long jump, long-distance running, martial arts, tug-of-war, and race walking. In Suide and Yan'an counties in northern Shaanxi, many people's communes hold sports meets every month. (Attached picture)

    劳动热情高涨
    歌声到处飘扬
    陕西群众生活丰富多彩
    本报讯  陕西省各地在实现生活集体化后，群众生活更加丰富多彩，到处飘扬赞扬社会主义制度好的歌声和笑声；社员的劳动热情更加高涨，田间管理，兴修水利都搞得很好。
    陕北、关中地区的人民公社的食堂除了把饭菜做得又多又香外，一般还给社员家里留了一定数量的作饭用具，必要时社员可以把米、面领回去自己做。全省有许多人民公社的食堂设了小卖部，社员可以自由购买。
    冬天到了。各地人民公社的缝纫部积极给群众准备冬装。临潼县人民公社的缝纫部给社员缝制的冬装，不仅式样新，而且用料节省，针线扎的牢，取活日子早。宝鸡县贾村人民公社贾村大队还给单身汉、五保户和多子女户发了六十三套新棉衣。
    由于人民公社的规模大，人力多，还给开展群众性的文娱活动带来了非常有利的条件。
    关中地区群众，成立了许多小型剧团或自乐班，在每天晚上或公休日进行演唱。长安县韦曲人民公社社员何芝芳是个刚摘掉文盲帽子的家庭妇女，可是，农业生产大跃进以来，她已经写了上千首诗，并且把自己写的诗套在剪纸内，使诗中有画，画中有诗。最近她已经把她自己剪的剪纸套诗寄给了敬爱的毛主席。西安市红色人民公社七十二岁的王益善老婆把自己的院子画满了画。
    陕西农民的体育活动也得到了蓬勃的发展。仅大荔、蓝田、安康三县不完全统计，即有各种运动队三千三百七十二个。安康县人民公社的营、连都有运动场地。汉中专区的人民公社中有许多营、连经常举行跳高、跳远、长跑、武术、拔河和竞走等体育活动。陕北绥德、延安县有许多人民公社，每月都举行运动会。（附图片）
