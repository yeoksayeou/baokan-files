    Calling River Water to Flow Uphill
    ——Visiting Water Control Hero Li Daguai
    By our reporter Tian Zhuang

    If you fly over northern Hubei and look down, you'll see: In this area of winding mountains and undulating hills, there are canals everywhere, connected to countless ponds, weirs and reservoirs. They gleam in the sunlight, a beautiful sight. This is the self-flowing irrigation network in the style of watermelon vines created by the Xiangyang Special District of Hubei Province.
    The watermelon vine-style self-flowing irrigation network in Xiangyang Special District is well-known, both in Hubei and throughout the country. Its characteristics are: damming rivers, opening canals along the mountains, and leading water up the mountains, connecting rivers, canals, ponds, weirs, and reservoirs, so as to store water year-round and use it when needed. This not only reduces and eliminates drought disasters, turning dry land into paddy fields, but also changes water-lifting into self-flowing irrigation. Because the river dams are like "watermelon stems," the diversion canals are like "watermelon vines," and the ponds, weirs, and reservoirs along the canals are like "watermelons" full of vines, the local people call this the watermelon vine-style self-flowing irrigation network. This is a creation in China's water conservancy construction, and it is rapidly changing the face of the Xiangyang Special District, which has long been known for its low agricultural output.
    How was the watermelon vine-style self-flowing irrigation network created? When you come into contact with cadres or farmers in Xiangyang Special District, they will introduce you to many heroic figures who created the watermelon vine-style irrigation network, and the most respected of them is Li Daguai. When I visited here in the spring and summer of this year, I heard more than once about the story of Li Daguai leading water up the mountain.
    It happened in 1954.
    In Junxian County, there was a place called Lijiawan, home to only twenty-one households. It was a very poor place. The reddish-orange soil was like it had been scorched by a fire. The locals describe it like this: "A knife on a sunny day, a mess on a rainy day." Before liberation, there was a folk song circulating here: "Suffering is worse than Lijiawan, barren mountains behind the bay, river beaches in front of the bay, either drought or flood, suffering from hunger and cold all year round…."
    After liberation, the farmers were emancipated. Under the leadership of the Party, they organized mutual aid teams, and in 1954, all the people in the village happily joined the agricultural cooperative. The director of the cooperative at that time was Li Daguai, who had suffered all kinds of torment. In this year, Li Daguai joined the Party, and now that he was elected by the people to lead the agricultural cooperative, he felt even more responsible. He thought, although production has been stronger year by year and life has been better year by year since liberation, it is still very hard compared to other places. All year round, they eat either coarse grains or sweet potatoes. How can we improve everyone's lives? This sense of glorious responsibility, like the waves stirred up in a big river, impacted Li Daguai, preventing him from settling down. One day, he walked heavily outside the village and was greeted by the roaring Dabo River. The Dabo River, how familiar it was to Li Daguai! Every summer, it roared through Lijiawan, and in winter, it seemed so docile and lovely. However, the Dabo River, which had been lying in front of Lijiawan for thousands of years, had never brought happiness to the people of Lijiawan. Now, for some reason, Li Daguai was suddenly attracted by the clear water in the Dabo River. He stayed there for a long time, thinking: "How wonderful it would be if we could lead the water up the slope and turn the dry land into paddy fields!"
    What a great ideal! Of course, it also contains great difficulties! Since he had this idea, Li Daguai was like he was obsessed. Whether he was working in the fields, eating, or sleeping, he thought about such a question: "How to lead the water up the mountain slope?" Li Daguai had grown up here since he was a child, and he knew the terrain near Lijiawan very well. He thought that water always flows from high places to low places. As the saying goes, "Water flows a hundred steps, it must be three feet lower." If we diverted water from afar, wouldn't we be able to get the water up the mountain? So, he walked more than a mile north along the Dabo River to a large river beach. Looking west from the river beach, the Buntou Pit was about the same height as the riverbed. This made Li Daguai very happy. However, he knew this was not a simple matter, so he did not tell anyone until he was completely sure, and he just went to the beach every day to wander around. At this time, Chen Yuwen, the county party secretary, came here to inspect production. Li Daguai took Secretary Chen to the river beach to see the rice in the newly converted paddy fields. After seeing it, Secretary Chen sat in the shade of the tree to cool off, and Daguai waded to the east bank, lying on the beach and aiming west.
    Secretary Chen asked, "Daguai, what are you doing?"
    "Looking at the canal," Li Daguai replied, and then got up, walked to the secretary, and told the secretary everything that had been on his mind for months.
    "Can it be done?" Secretary Chen asked with some surprise.
    "It can be done to open a canal from Buntou Pit!"
    Secretary Chen knew that Li Daguai never said empty words. Whatever he said, he would surely do it. So, he patted him on the shoulder and said:
    "Then cheer up and do it!"
    This boosted Li Daguai's courage. That night, he convened the management committee of the cooperative and told everyone about the water diversion. He originally estimated that everyone would support him, but he didn't expect that someone would speak up before he finished speaking: "That's a good idea! Since ancient times, water flows downhill, how can river water flow uphill?" Some people also said: "If it could be done, our ancestors would have done it eight generations ago, why wait for us?" Everyone was clamoring, and the meeting broke up unhappily.
    When the cooperative members learned that Li Daguai wanted to divert water up the mountain, most of them did not believe it. A cooperative member named Li Dajin even composed a song: "Singing upside down, singing upside down, since ancient times, river water has never flowed uphill."
    Li Daguai had such a characteristic that as long as something was beneficial to everyone and could be done, he would ignore all opposition and do it. In order to get the water up the mountain, he observed from the river beach to the steep pit, from the steep pit to the steep slope every day. Although the riverbed seemed to be slightly higher than the west bank from the terrain, who could guarantee that it was accurate with the naked eye? Once, he suddenly remembered aiming when he was a militiaman. He thought that if he looked through a bamboo tube, wouldn't it be more accurate? So, he took a thin bamboo tube and, according to the principle of "nothing is finer than a line, nothing is flatter than water," put a bowl filled with water on a long bench, and then, like aiming a gun, looked at the west bank through the small eye of the bamboo tube. The result was that the Buntou Pit area was indeed lower than the riverbed, and water could be diverted up the mountain. Li Daguai was overjoyed and ran back to the village to tell the cooperative members the news. Who knew that some cooperative members still shook their heads in disbelief, especially the older people who were even more arguing. An old man named Yang Xuecheng smiled at Daguai and said: "Trying to divert the river water to Lijiawan is like pulling a boat on dry land, messing around!" Another man nicknamed "Big Mouth" Zhu Peixin insisted on betting with Li Daguai that if water could go uphill, he would remove his surname. Before this, Li Daguai's father, brother, and wife were also dissatisfied with him. As a result, the whole family advised him to mind his own business. However, Li Daguai did not waver at all. Thinking of Secretary Chen's words and the series of painful days before liberation, his determination to divert water up the mountain slope became even stronger.
    In order to win the support of the cooperative members, he repeatedly measured, and also invited many cadres and cooperative members to look through the bamboo tube with him and measure the canal. As time went by, some people slowly changed their views and said: "The bamboo tube measurement is somewhat accurate, let's do it according to his opinion." Then, he convened a meeting of cooperative members and explained the diversion of water up the mountain, which was supported by most of the cooperative members, and he began to build the canal. It only took four and a half days to dig a water diversion canal of four hundred meters long. As a result, the water of the Dabo River climbed up Lijiawan for the first time. In this year, a total of thirty mu of paddy fields were converted. From then on, Li Daguai led the cooperative members to dig canals and divert water every year. By this year, this agricultural cooperative with only more than 180 households (now a commune) has expanded its paddy fields to 2,000 mu. This year, the rice harvest alone was more than 960,000 catties. The cooperative members happily sang: "Building water conservancy has many benefits, green water smiles as it goes up the slope, the mountains are green, the rice is fragrant, the water mill sounds, and life is getting happier and happier."
    Li Daguai's pioneering work of diverting water up the mountain quickly spread and was promoted. In particular, Guanghua County, which is adjacent to Junxian County, further developed Li Daguai's experience of diverting water up the mountain, achieving river-connected canals and canal-connected ponds, storing water all year round and irrigating fields when needed. As a result, it was even more welcomed by the vast number of cadres and people in the district. In the past winter and spring alone, this special district built more than 27,000 large canals, including 124 that were more than 100 li long. Around these spider web-like canals are countless ponds, weirs, and reservoirs. This forms a self-flowing irrigation network in the style of watermelon vines, ensuring that the district's grain and cotton have achieved unprecedented harvests this year.
    Now, Li Daguai, this water control hero, has been selected by the whole district as a representative to attend the national conference of advanced units in agricultural socialist construction.

    叫河水流上山坡
    ——访治水英雄李大贵
    本报记者  田庄
    如果你坐着飞机穿过鄂北上空往下了望，就会发现：在这个群山蜿蜒、丘陵起伏的地方，到处是一条又一条的渠道，连结渠道两旁的便是数也数不清的塘、堰和水库，它们在阳光的照耀下，金光闪闪，看去十分美丽，这就是湖北省襄阳专区创造的西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网。
    襄阳专区的西瓜秧式自流灌溉网，无论在湖北还是在全国，都是很有名的。它的特点是，拦河扎坝，盘山开渠，引水上山，使河水、渠道、塘堰和水库连接起来，做到常年蓄水，忙时用水，不仅减少和消灭旱灾，变旱地为水田，而且可以变车水为自流灌溉。由于拦河坝像“瓜蒂”，引水渠像“瓜秧”，而沿渠道两旁的塘堰和水库，像结满了瓜藤的“西瓜”，因此，当地群众都把这叫西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网。这是我国水利建设上的创造，它迅速地改变着素以农业低产著名的襄阳专区的面貌。
    西瓜秧式自流灌溉网是怎样创造的呢？当你与襄阳专区的干部或是农民接触的时候，他们都会向你介绍许多创造西瓜秧式灌溉网的英雄人物，而其中最受人们敬爱的就是李大贵。今年春、夏，我在这里访问的时候，就曾不止一次地听到关于李大贵引水上山的故事。
    那是1954年的事。
    均县有个只有二十一户人家的李家湾，那是个非常寒苦的地方。红橙色的土地就像大火烧过一般，当地人都是这样形容它：“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟”。解放前，这里流传着这样一只歌谣：“遭孽莫过李家湾，湾后荒山，湾前河滩，不是干就是淹，一年四季受饥寒……。”
    解放后，农民翻了身。在党的领导下，他们组织了互助组，到了1954年，全村的人又高高兴兴地参加了农业社。当时的社主任便是受尽了折磨，吃尽了苦头的李大贵。这一年，李大贵已经入了党，现在又被大伙推举出来领导农业社，他越发感到自己责任重大。他想，解放几年来，虽说生产一年比一年强，生活一年也比一年好，但同其他地方比起来，还是很苦，一年到头吃的不是杂粮就是红薯。怎样才能使大家的生活好起来呢？这样一种光荣的责任感像大河里激起的浪花冲击着李大贵，使他不能平静下来。有一天，他心事重重地走到村外，迎面就是哗哗作响的大柏河。大柏河，对李大贵来说这是多么熟悉呵！每年夏天，它咆哮着穿过李家湾，到了冬天，它又显得那么温驯而又可爱。但是，这条已经横躺在李家湾前千百年的大柏河，却从没有给李家湾的人带来幸福。现在，不知怎的，李大贵一下子被大柏河里的清澈的水吸引住了，他久久地呆在那里，心里想：“如果把水引上坡来，把旱地改成了水田，该多美气呵！”
    这是个多么伟大的理想！当然，这里面也包含着多么大的困难呵！自从有了这个念头，李大贵就像着了迷似的，不管在地里干活也好，吃饭睡觉也好，他都思索着这样一个问题：“怎样把水引上山坡呢？”李大贵自小就在这里长大，对李家湾附近的地形摸得烂熟。他想，水总是从高处往低处流的，俗话说：“水流百步要低三尺”，如果从远处引水，不就可以把水引上山了吗？于是，他沿着大柏河朝北走了一里多路，到了一个大河滩，从河滩上向西一看，奔头坑与河床高低差不多。这下可把李大贵喜坏了。但是，他知道这是件不简单的事，所以在没有完全弄准以前，他没有对任何人说，只是天天到滩上转来转去。就在这时候，县委书记陈玉文到这里检查生产来了，李大贵就带着陈书记到河滩里看新改的几亩水田的稻谷，看罢了，陈书记坐在树荫下乘凉，大贵便涉水到了东岸，伏在沙滩上面朝西瞄来瞄去。
    陈书记问：“大贵，你在干什么呀？”
      “看渠道。”李大贵一面回答，一面爬了起来，走到书记跟前，把闷在心里几个月的事情，一五一十地对书记说了。
    “能行吗？”陈书记带着几分惊讶。
      “从奔头坑上开条渠道能行！”
    陈书记知道李大贵从来不说空话，不管做什么事情，只要说出了口，准能做成功。于是，就拍着他肩膀说：
    “那就鼓起劲来干吧！”
    这一下李大贵的胆子壮起来了。当天晚上他就召开了社管理委员会，把引水的事儿对大家说了一遍。他原来估计大家一定会支持他，没想到他的话还没说完，有人就开腔了：“想的真好！自古水往低处流，那有河水上山坡？”也有的说：“要能行，祖先八辈子早已搞了，还等到我们这一辈？”大家七嘴八舌地嚷嚷着，会就是这样不欢而散了。
    社员们知道李大贵要引水上山，也大都不相信，有个叫李大金的社员还编了一只歌：“说倒歌，唱倒歌，自古那有河水流上坡”。
    李大贵有这样一个特点，只要对大家有利的事情，而又有可能办到，他就会不顾一切反对，一定要干下去。为了把水引上山来，他每天从河滩到陡坑，从陡坑到陡坡进行观察，虽然从地形上看来，河床比西岸略高，但是肉眼看的谁又能保证一定准确呢？有一次，他突然想起过去当民兵时打枪瞄准的事来，他想，如果用一根竹筒子看，不是看得更准确吗？于是，他就拿来一根细竹筒，又根据“细不过线，平不过水”的道理，把一碗装满了水的碗，放在一条长凳上，然后像打枪瞄准一样，从竹筒里的小眼眼朝西岸看，结果发现奔头坑一带的确比河床低，可以引水上山。这下李大贵高兴极了，连忙跑回村里把这个消息告诉社员们。谁知有些社员仍是摇头不相信，特别是上了年纪的人更是议论纷纷。有个叫杨学成的老头，冲着大贵笑笑说：“想把河水引到李家湾，这不是旱地里拉船，胡乱搞！”还有个外号叫“大嘴”的朱培新，硬要跟李大贵打赌，说，水要能上山坡，他就把姓字勾掉。在这以前，李大贵的父亲、哥哥和妻子也对他不满意，这样一来，全家都劝他多一事不如少一事。但是，李大贵没有一丝动摇，他想到陈书记的话，又想到解放前那一连串痛苦的日子，他引水上山坡的决心更大了。
    为了争取社员们的支持，他反复地进行测量，同时，还邀请了许多干部和社员同他一道看竹筒，测渠道。日子一久，有些人就慢慢地改变了自己的看法，说：“竹筒子测量有些板眼，就照着他的意见办吧。”接着，他又召开了社员大会，向大家说清引水上山的事，得到了大部分社员的拥护，便动起手来修渠道。前后只花了四天半的时间，就挖好了一条长达四百公尺的引水渠。于是，大柏河的水破天荒地爬上了李家湾。这一年，总共改水田三十亩。从这以后，李大贵年年领导着社员挖渠引水，到了今年，这个只有一百八十多户的农业社（现已成立公社），水田已经扩大到二千亩，今年光稻谷就收了九十六万多斤。社员们是这样地高兴地唱道：“兴修水利好处多，绿水笑着上山坡，山青稻香水磨响，日子越过越快活。”
    李大贵引水上山的创举很快地传开并且推广了。特别是与均县相邻的光化县，进一步发展了李大贵引水上山的经验，做到了河连渠，渠连塘，常年蓄水，忙时灌田，因而更加受到了全区广大干部和群众的欢迎，仅在去冬今春四个多月的时间里，这个专区就修筑了较大的渠道二万七千多条，其中长达百里以上的有一百二十四条。而在这些蛛网般的渠道周围，便是无数的塘、堰和水库。这就形成了西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网，保证了全区今年粮食和棉花都获得了史无前例的大丰收。
    现在，李大贵——这位治水英雄，已被全区选为参加全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的代表。
