    Warm and Good Again
    Zhang Ke
    In winter, "warmth" and "goodness" are often closely linked. Cold rice and cold dishes make it difficult for people to say they are eating well, and a room that is not warm or a kang that is not heated means people cannot sleep well. That is to say, if the problem of heating is not solved, the issue of "goodness" will also be discounted. Some People's Communes are now paying great attention to the winter needs of their members. To ensure that members can drink hot soup and water, and eat hot meals and dishes when they return from work, many canteens have borrowed a batch of houses as dining halls, or built some simple dining halls, and have also prepared some food warming equipment. Regarding the heating problem of commune members' families, some communes have also prepared a large amount of coal or other fuel to ensure that members can sleep on a warm kang. In solving the problem of winter clothing for commune members, they have organized efforts to rush sewing and mending the clothing, bedding, shoes and socks of the commune members. In this way, all commune members can be in a cheerful mood and work energetically in winter production.
    These trivial matters of life were originally handled by the commune members themselves in the era of individual households. Once winter arrived, women would wash and sew, busy preparing cotton clothes, and men would run around preparing fuel. After returning from work, sitting on a warm kang, drinking a bowl of hot soup, and eating a few bowls of hot rice, half of the day's fatigue would be eliminated. Sleeping on a warm kang for a night would completely eliminate the day's fatigue. Since the Great Leap Forward this year, women have participated in production one after another, and the manpower and time devoted to housework have been reduced. Under these circumstances, the leadership must care about these matters and solve them.
    Of course, solving these problems will not be without some difficulties. For example, building dining halls requires both materials and labor. Making cotton clothes requires both cotton cloth and cotton, as well as sewing people. However, as long as the leadership mobilizes the masses, everyone offers suggestions, and everyone takes action, these difficulties can be overcome. Wuxiang County Chengguan People's Commune in Shanxi Province originally had no fuel for the winter, but after mobilizing the masses, they found eight ways to increase fuel. More than 1,400 canteens and dining halls were established in Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, and most of the materials and utensils were raised by mobilizing the masses.
    When solving the problem of winter clothing, it is also necessary to promote the spirit of diligence, thrift, mutual assistance and friendship. That is to say, those that can be mended and altered can be worn, and there is no need to make new ones for the time being; those that can be solved by themselves do not need to be solved by the commune. At present, there are a very small number of people who do not think this way. They believe that after the establishment of the People's Commune, everyone should be the same in everything, eating the same and wearing the same. If winter clothing is not made, it should not be made; if it is made, everyone should have a set, otherwise it does not look like a People's Commune. This statement is of course wrong. Not to mention that the material wealth is not yet abundant, and it is simply impossible to do so. Even if the material wealth is abundant in the future, it can only be distributed according to needs, not absolute equal distribution.
    Many People's Communes have made great achievements in ensuring that commune members eat well, sleep well, and rest well. As for the winter problem, as long as there is determination, it can certainly be solved well.

    又暖又好

    在冬天，“暖”和“好”往往是紧密相联的，冷饭冷菜，很难使人们说吃好，房不暖、炕不热，人们也睡不好。这就是说，如果取暖的问题得不到解决，好的问题也就要打折扣。现在已有一些人民公社对社员的过冬问题十分重视。为了使社员劳动归来，能够喝到热汤热水、吃到热饭热菜，不少食堂都筹借一批房屋作饭厅，或修建一些简易饭厅，同时还准备了一些饭菜保暖设备。对于社员家庭取暖的问题，有的公社也已准备好大批煤炭或其他燃料，以保证社员睡上热炕。在解决社员冬装问题上，组织了力量突击缝补社员的衣被鞋袜。这样，全体社员就能心情舒畅，干劲十足地在搞冬季生产。
    这些生活琐事在一家一户时代，本来都是社员自己处理的，一交冬季，妇女就洗啊缝啊忙着准备棉衣，男人东跑西走的忙着准备燃料。劳动归来，在热炕上一坐，喝上一碗热汤，吃上几碗热饭，一天的疲劳就消除了一半，再在热炕睡上一夜，一天的疲劳完全消除了。今年大跃进以来，妇女纷纷参加生产，从事家务劳动的人力和时间都少了，在这种情况下，领导上就必须关心这些事情，解决这些事情。
    解决这些问题，当然不会没有一点困难，例如修饭厅，既要材料、又要劳动力。做棉衣，既要棉布和棉花，又要缝纫的人。但是只要领导上发动群众，个个献策，人人动手，这些困难是可以克服的。山西武乡县城关人民公社本来没有过冬的燃料，发动群众以后，就找出了八种增加燃料的办法。江西龙南县农村办了一千四百多个食堂、饭厅，材料、用具大部分是发动群众筹集的。
    在解决冬装问题的时候，也还要提倡勤俭节约和互助友爱的精神，这就是能够补补改改穿的，暂时不必做新的；自己有力量解决的，不必要求公社来解决。现在有极少数人不是这样想的，他们认为建立人民公社后，什么事都要人人一样，吃一样，穿一样。冬装要就不做，要做就每人一套，否则就不像人民公社。这种说法当然是错误的。不要说现在物质财富还不丰富，根本办不到，即使是将来物质财富丰富了，也只能是各取所需，而不是绝对平均分配。
    许多人民公社在保证社员吃好、睡好、休息好上，做出了不少成绩。在过冬问题上，只要有决心，一定也能解决得很好。
