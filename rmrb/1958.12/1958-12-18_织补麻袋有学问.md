The workers of the Shanghai Sack Repair Factory introduced their plan to establish a specialized school to the teachers and students of East China Normal University. At the time, this almost caused an uproar of laughter. The teachers and students thought: the tools for repairing sacks are simple, and the procedures are not complicated, so where can it be "specialized"? Isn't it just mending sacks!

After the students went to the workshop, they saw that many veteran workers were very skilled, and their work was fast and agile, while some young people were clumsy and not doing a good job. They then realized that repairing sacks required skilled craftsmanship. At the same time, they learned that workers use manual labor to repair sacks, which is very laborious, and the future direction is mechanization and automation. The workers are already studying and creating machines for weaving and repairing sacks. At this time, the students' thinking changed: why isn't weaving and repairing sacks a field of knowledge? They inspired the veteran workers to summarize their experience and self-compile a "Sack Repair Technology" book. They also helped establish practical physics and chemistry and some other basic courses according to the needs of sack weaving and repairing gradually moving towards automation. Thus, this school established a new discipline called the "Sack Department."

Now, all the workers in the factory are studying in this department, while further improving the trial production of sack weaving and repairing machines.

    织补麻袋有学问
    上海麻袋修补厂工人向华东师范大学的师生介绍他们将要创办一所专科学校。当时几乎引得哄堂大笑。师生们想：修补麻袋用的工具很简便，工序也不复杂，能“专”到哪里去呢？还不是修补修补麻袋而已！
    学生们下车间以后，看到许多老工人技术很熟练，干起活来又快又灵敏，而一些小伙子就粗手粗脚，做不大像样，才发觉修补麻袋要有熟练的手艺技术。同时他们了解到工人使用手工修补麻袋很费力，今后的方向是机械化、自动化。工人们已经在研究创制织补麻袋的机器。这时学生们的思想转变过来了：织补麻袋何尝不是一门学问呢？他们就启发老工人总结经验，自编一本“麻袋修补工艺学”。他们并且根据织补麻袋逐步走向自动化的需要，帮助设立实用理化和一些其他基础课程，于是这所学校就成立了新的学科“麻袋系”。
    现在，全厂的工人正在这个系里学习，同时进一步改进麻袋织补机的试制工作。
