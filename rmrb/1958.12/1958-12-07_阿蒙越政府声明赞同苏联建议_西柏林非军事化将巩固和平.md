Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 5th: The Albanian government issued a statement on the 5th, fully endorsing the Soviet government's proposal to transform West Berlin into an independent political entity - a demilitarized free city.

The statement pointed out that the Western countries have flagrantly violated the Potsdam Agreement, thereby completely forfeiting their legal and moral right to occupy West Berlin.

The statement said that the time has come to declare the end of the occupation.

The statement said that this new Soviet proposal is conducive to easing international tensions. It will not only transform West Berlin from a hotbed of the Cold War into a city of peace, but also bring new prosperity to West Berlin. Ending the Western countries' occupation of West Berlin will create favorable conditions for the normalization of relations between East and West Germany, enabling them to move towards rapprochement and peaceful reunification.

The statement finally emphasized that the Albanian government believes that any provocative attempts by Western aggressive blocs and German revanchist militarism against the borders and security of the German Democratic Republic or any other Warsaw Treaty member state are an attack on all Warsaw Treaty member states. In this case, Albania will undoubtedly fulfill all the obligations stipulated by the Warsaw Treaty together with other socialist countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, December 6th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic issued a statement today, saying that the Mongolian government warmly welcomes and supports the Soviet proposal on the Berlin issue.

The statement said that the Mongolian government believes that the Soviet government's proposal on the Berlin issue is in line with the interests of the German people and is a concrete step towards safeguarding European security and establishing lasting world peace.

The statement said that the Mongolian government and people believe that making West Berlin a free city is the only correct proposal in the current situation. The realization of this proposal will eliminate West Germany's sabotage activities against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. This is an important contribution to defending European and world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 6th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, supporting the Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the Berlin issue.

The statement said, "The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully agree with and resolutely support the proposal put forward by the Soviet government that the troops of the United States, Britain, and France must withdraw from West Berlin, abolish the occupation system, and let West Berlin become an independent political entity and a demilitarized free city.

"The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that this practical and legitimate proposal is of great significance for easing tensions in Europe and the world. It can help improve relations between countries with different political and social systems, and at the same time, it can create favorable conditions for realizing the reunification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy."

    阿蒙越政府声明赞同苏联建议
    西柏林非军事化将巩固和平
    新华社地拉那5日电  阿尔巴尼亚政府5日发表声明，完全赞同苏联政府关于把西柏林变成一个独立的政治单位——非军事的自由城市的建议。
    声明指出，西方国家粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定，因而完全丧失了在法律上和道义上占领西柏林的权利。
    声明说，现在已是宣告结束占领的时候了。
    声明说，苏联这一新的建议有利于缓和国际紧张局势。它不仅将把西柏林从冷战的策源地变成为和平的城市，并且还将给西柏林带来新的繁荣。结束西方国家对西柏林的占领将为东西德关系正常化创造有利条件，使它们走上彼此接近和和平统一的道路。
    声明最后强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府认为，西方侵略集团和德国复仇军国主义对民主德国或任何其他华沙条约缔约国的边境和安全的挑衅企图都是对所有华沙条约成员国的进攻，在这种情况下，阿尔巴尼亚无疑将和其他社会主义国家一起履行华沙条约所规定的一切义务。
    据新华社乌兰巴托6日电  蒙古人民共和国外交部今天发表声明说，蒙古政府热烈欢迎和支持苏联关于柏林问题的建议。
    声明说，蒙古政府认为苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议是符合德国人民利益的，是维护欧洲安全和建立世界持久和平的具体步骤。
    声明说，蒙古政府和人民相信，使西柏林变成一个自由城市是在目前情况下唯一正确的建议。实现了这一建议将消除西德对民主德国、苏联及人民民主国家的破坏活动。这是对保卫欧洲和世界和平的重要贡献。
    据新华社河内6日电  越南民主共和国政府今天发表声明，支持苏联政府就柏林问题给美、英、法三国政府的照会。
    声明说，“越南人民和越南民主共和国政府完全赞成，并且坚决支持苏联政府提出的建议，就是美、英、法三国军队必须撤出西柏林，废除占领制度，让西柏林成为一个独立的政治单位和非军事化的自由城市。
    “越南民主共和国政府认为，这个切实而正当的建议，对缓和欧洲和世界紧张局势具有重要作用，它可以帮助改善不同政治制度和社会制度的国家之间的关系，同时，可以为实现在和平、民主基础上统一德国创造有利的条件。”
