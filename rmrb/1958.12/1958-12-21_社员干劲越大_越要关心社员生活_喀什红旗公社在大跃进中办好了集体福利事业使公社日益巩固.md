Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 20th: The Hongqi People's Commune in the suburbs of Kashi City, southern Xinjiang, while vigorously developing production, has firmly grasped the task of running collective welfare undertakings well, making the commune increasingly consolidated.

The Hongqi People's Commune is a large commune composed of farmers of Uyghur, Uzbek, and other ethnicities. Since its establishment more than two months ago, although a large number of laborers have been drawn to the mountains to make iron, the remaining commune members have still excellently completed tasks such as autumn harvesting and planting, and afforestation. The commune's Party committee, considering that the more enthusiastic the commune members are, the more they should care about their lives, has particularly focused on running collective welfare undertakings closely related to the vast number of commune members, such as public canteens and nurseries.

In order to ensure that commune members of all ethnic groups eat well and have enough, the commune's Party committee has held three on-site meetings in the past two months to exchange experiences in canteen work and formulate detailed canteen management rules. Each management area has transferred capable cadres to be responsible for canteen work and organized canteen management committees to implement democratic management. The canteen of the first team in the fourth district has formulated a weekly menu based on the various foods that Uyghur farmers like, ensuring that the main meal is not repeated every afternoon, such as cold noodles, pilaf, rice, noodle soup, fried cakes, and layered pastries, with a different dish each day. Hot meals are also delivered to the fields at noon. The commune members are all happy. The canteens also mobilized the masses to discuss and adjust the food standards based on income levels, basically achieving good and full meals with less money.

This commune has established more than seventy nurseries, freeing more than 2,500 women from the burden of childcare and enabling them to devote themselves to production. Now, welfare committees have been established from the commune to the districts and teams to strengthen the leadership of the nurseries, and to absorb parents, production team leaders, etc., to participate in the democratic management of the nurseries, strengthen the political and professional study of the caregivers, and conduct regular inspections and evaluations. At present, most nurseries have met the requirements of three satisfactions, which are: children like nannies and collective life, making the children satisfied; parents are free from worries during production, making the parents satisfied; and a large number of laborers have been added, making the commune collective satisfied. The nursery of the third team in the fourth district provides the children with three meals a day, as well as some beneficial snacks such as corn puffs and carrots at regular intervals. All the nurseries have heated brick beds, which are warm as spring. Older children have learned to sing, play games, and do exercises. They take naps on time at noon, and their lives are regular and interesting. The children are healthy, lively, and lovely.

The commune has also rectified the homes for the elderly, so that more than one hundred elderly or disabled people who are homeless receive meticulous care. Their residences are near fruit trees and grape trellises, the houses are clean, the environment is beautiful, and all living expenses are borne by the commune. They can often eat noodle soup, meat, and milk.

Because the collective welfare undertakings of the commune are well-managed, the commune members are in a good mood, love the commune more, and their enthusiasm for production has been significantly improved. In the severe cold, thirty-one dry canals were dug in ten days. The one hundred and five male and female commune members in the fifth management area dug an average of 5.5 cubic meters of soil per person per day, greatly breaking the quota. Recently, the commune members launched a competition in deep plowing the land. By December 10, they had plowed more than 570 mu of land, all to a depth of about three feet. Commune members of all ethnic groups sang happily in the fields: The people's commune is good, we eat hot and full meals, we pick up the soil shovels, plow the land and repair the canals, everyone is very enthusiastic, and we dig out underground treasures.

    社员干劲越大  越要关心社员生活
    喀什红旗公社在大跃进中办好了集体福利事业使公社日益巩固
    新华社乌鲁木齐20日电  新疆南部喀什市郊区红旗人民公社在大力发展生产的同时，紧紧抓住了办好集体福利事业，使公社日益巩固。
    红旗人民公社是由维吾尔、乌孜别克等族农民组成的大公社。这个公社成立两个多月来，虽然抽出了大批劳力上山炼铁，留下的社员仍然出色地完成了秋收秋种、植树造林等项任务。公社党委考虑到社员干劲越大，就越应该关心社员的生活，因而特别抓紧了办好同广大社员关系密切的公共食堂和托儿所等集体福利事业。
    为了让各族社员吃饱吃好，公社党委两个多月来先后召开了三次现场会议，交流食堂工作经验，制定了食堂管理细则，各管理区都抽调得力干部负责食堂工作，并组织食堂管理委员会，实行民主管理。四区一队食堂根据维吾尔农民所喜欢的各种饭食，订出了一周的食谱，保证每天下午主餐不吃重样饭，如凉面、抓饭、米饭、汤面、油饼、油塔子等，一天一个样。中午还向田间送热饭。社员们人人高兴。各食堂还发动群众讨论，根据收入水平调整了伙食标准，基本上作到了既吃得好、吃得饱，又花钱少。
    这个公社已办起七十多个托儿所，使二千五百多名妇女摆脱了孩子拖累，投入了生产。现在从公社到各区、队已分别建立福利委员会，加强领导托儿所，并吸收家长、生产队长等参加托儿所的民主管理，加强保育员的政治和业务学习，定期检查评比。现在，多数托儿所达到了三满意的要求，这就是：喜欢阿姨和集体生活，娃娃满意；生产中无牵无挂，家长满意；增加了大批劳动力，公社集体满意。四区三队托儿所每天给娃娃吃三顿饭以外，还定时供给一些玉米花、胡萝卜等有益的零食。托儿所内都有火墙，温暖如春。大一点的孩子已学会了唱歌、作游戏、作体操，中午按时睡午觉，生活有规律、有趣，孩子们健康活泼可爱。
    公社还整顿了敬老院，使一百多位无依无靠的老年人或残废人得到无微不至的照顾。他们的住处附近有果树和葡萄架，房屋整洁，环境优美，生活费用全由公社负担。他们经常能吃到汤面、肉食和牛奶。
    由于公社集体福利事业办得好，社员心情舒畅，更加热爱公社，生产积极性显著提高。在严寒中，十天就挖了三十一条干渠。第五管理区的一百零五名男女社员，平均每人每天挖土五点五方，大大突破定额。最近社员们在深翻土地中展开了竞赛，到12月10日已经翻了五百七十多亩地，深度都在三尺左右，各族社员在田间欢乐地唱道：人民公社好，吃得热又饱，提起砍土镘，翻地修渠道，人人干劲大，挖出地下宝。
