    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th: The North Atlantic Council meeting released a communique on the Berlin issue on the 16th, rejecting the Soviet proposals to end the occupied status of Berlin and to make West Berlin a demilitarized free city.

    This communique was released as a result of the discussion on the Berlin issue by the ministers of the fifteen member countries of the North Atlantic Group on the morning of the 16th. It attempts to create the appearance that the North Atlantic Group countries are "united" on the Berlin issue. The communique said that the Council "fully supports" the opinions expressed by the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany on the Berlin issue on the 14th. "The demands made by the Soviet government have created a serious situation, which must be resolutely dealt with."

    However, this communique does not offer any serious grounds for opposing the Soviet proposals, but only states: "The Berlin issue can only be resolved within the scope of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on the entire German question."

    The communique said: The Western countries are prepared to discuss with the Soviet Union "the German question, as well as European security issues and disarmament issues." This shows that the Western countries do not dare to slam the door on negotiations, but try to tie the Berlin issue to other issues in order to make the problem as complicated as possible.

    Although the Berlin issue is touted by the North Atlantic Group as one of internal unity, the communique has not been able to conceal the fact that the Western countries have differences of opinion on how to deal with the Soviet Union's determination to end the occupied status of Berlin.

    It is reported that in the closed-door meeting, a "fierce debate" took place over whether to include the German question in the communique.

### 北大西洋集团坚持冷战  拒绝苏联关于柏林问题建议

    北大西洋集团坚持冷战
    拒绝苏联关于柏林问题建议
    新华社17日讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋集团理事会会议16日就柏林问题发表了一项公报，表示拒绝苏联关于结束柏林的被占领状态和使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市的建议。
    这项公报是作为北大西洋集团十五个成员国的部长们16日上午关于柏林问题的讨论结果而发表的。它力图作出这样的姿态：北大西洋集团各国在柏林问题上是“团结一致”的。公报说，理事会“完全支持”美、英、法、西德四国政府14日就柏林问题表示的意见。“苏联政府提出的要求已经造成一种严重局势，必须坚决对待这种严重局势”。
    但是这项公报对苏联的建议提不出任何认真的反对理由，它只是说：“柏林问题只能在同苏联就整个德国问题取得协议的范围以内解决”。
    公报说：西方国家准备同苏联讨论“德国问题以及欧洲安全问题和裁军问题”。这表明，西方国家不敢砰然关上谈判的大门，但力图把柏林问题同其他问题扯在一起，以使问题尽量复杂化。
    尽管柏林问题是北大西洋集团吹嘘为内部一致的问题，公报也没有能够掩盖这样一个事实：西方国家在如何对付苏联决心结束柏林的被占领状态的建议上意见有分歧。
    据报道，在秘密会议上，关于是否把德国问题写进公报这一点就发生了“激烈的争论”。
