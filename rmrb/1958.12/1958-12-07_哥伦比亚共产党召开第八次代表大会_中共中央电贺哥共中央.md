Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia on November 4th, congratulating the Communist Party of Colombia on the opening of its Eighth National Congress on December 7th. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia and all comrades of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of Colombia:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all its members and the people of the whole country, extends to you warm and fraternal congratulations.

    Your party is the loyal representative of the interests of the Colombian people. Since its establishment, your party has been unyielding in its struggle against imperialist aggression, to safeguard Colombia's national independence, and to strive for the democratic rights and improved living standards of the Colombian people. We are very pleased with the remarkable achievements you have made in your struggle.

    U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. At present, it is frantically engaged in war preparations, expanding its aggression, armed intervention in the Middle East, and constantly carrying out military provocations against China, while at the same time intensifying its political intervention and economic plunder of Colombia and other Latin American countries, seriously threatening world peace and the security of the people of all countries. But now is no longer the era of imperialist tyranny. As long as the awakened people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America unite with the people of other countries and with the socialist camp, they will have the power to smash all the aggressive crimes of the U.S. imperialists.

    We wish your congress complete success! We congratulate you on achieving new and significant successes in the struggle to defend Colombia's national sovereignty, the democratic freedoms and living rights of the Colombian people, in the struggle to strengthen the unity of the Colombian working class and all patriotic and democratic forces, and in the struggle to strengthen the unity and cooperation of the people of Latin American countries to jointly oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and oppression and to defend world peace. We congratulate your party on its growing development and consolidation.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, November 4, 1958

    哥伦比亚共产党召开第八次代表大会
    中共中央电贺哥共中央
    新华社6日讯  中国共产党中央委员会11月4日打电报给哥伦比亚共产党中央委员会，祝贺哥伦比亚共产党定于12月7日召开的哥伦比亚共产党第八次代表大会。电文如下：哥伦比亚共产党中央委员会并转哥伦比亚共产党第八次代表大会全体同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体党员和全国人民向你们致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    你们的党是哥伦比亚人民利益的忠实的代表者。你们的党自成立以来，就不屈不挠地为反对帝国主义侵略、维护哥伦比亚的民族独立、争取哥伦比亚人民的民主权利和生活改善而进行着斗争。我们对于你们在斗争中所取得的卓越成就，感到非常高兴。
    美帝国主义是世界人民最凶恶的敌人。目前它正在疯狂地进行备战，扩大侵略，武装干涉中东，对中国不断地进行武力挑衅，同时加紧对哥伦比亚和拉丁美洲其他国家实行政治干预和经济掠夺，严重地威胁着世界的和平和各国人民的安全。但是现在已经不是帝国主义者横行霸道的时代了。只要已经觉醒了的亚、非、拉丁美洲的人民，同其他各国人民联合在一起，同社会主义阵营联合在一起，就完全有力量粉碎美帝国主义者的一切侵略罪行。
    我们祝贺你们的代表大会圆满成功！祝贺你们在保卫哥伦比亚的国家主权、哥伦比亚人民的民主自由和生活权益的斗争中，在加强哥伦比亚工人阶级和一切爱国民主力量的团结的斗争中，在加强拉丁美洲各国人民的团结合作、共同反对美帝国主义的侵略压迫和捍卫世界和平的斗争中，获得新的重大的成就。祝贺你们的党日益发展、日益巩固。
    中国共产党中央委员会  1958年11月4日
