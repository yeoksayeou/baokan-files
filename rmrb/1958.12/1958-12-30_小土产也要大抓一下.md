Small native products occupy a considerable proportion in China's agricultural economy. They are diverse in variety, large in output, and wide in use, and are closely related to industrial and agricultural production and the daily life of the broad masses of the people. In particular, various wild plants that have been neglected for a long time, such as wild fibers and wild oilseeds, can be processed into good substitutes, which is of great help in solving the problem of insufficient industrial raw materials. Obviously, it is an aspect that cannot be ignored to let these small native products enter the hall of elegance, shine brightly, and serve production and consumption.

However, after the bumper harvest in agriculture, some people have developed a tendency to underestimate small native products in their thinking. For example, some people think that "the bumper harvest in agriculture is enough to eat and use" and "just grasp the major agricultural products." As a result, they are not active enough in sideline production. This idea has become a major obstacle to the current work of vigorously grasping small local products in many areas. Can it be considered that after a bumper harvest in agriculture, the production of small local and special products can be relaxed? Of course not. Small native products are indispensable to all sectors of the national economy. This has become even clearer since the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. For example, a large amount of native products such as reed mats, charcoal, moso bamboo, palm fiber, raw lacquer, and saltpeter are needed for building sheds, factories, and mines in the mass steelmaking and water conservancy construction movements in various places; industry also needs a large amount of wild fiber, oilseeds, and starch as substitute raw materials for manufacturing alcohol, lubricating oil, papermaking, and ropes for deep plowing using rope traction; without or lacking these small native products, the development of industrial and agricultural production in winter and spring will inevitably be affected. As for the daily life of the broad masses of the people, they need a wide variety of small native products, such as various non-staple foods, Chinese medicinal materials, and various daily necessities. At present, the production of these small native products is far from meeting the needs of the above aspects.

After the people's communes, the self-sufficient production part used to directly meet the needs of the commune has greatly increased, which is a very good phenomenon. However, can we therefore ignore commodity production? Obviously not. Because developing commodity production and expanding commodity exchange is not only the need of all aspects of the national economy, but also an indispensable condition for promoting the all-round economic development of the people's communes and promoting the consolidation of the people's communes. After this year's bumper harvest in agriculture, the commune members have improved and increased their food consumption, but the economic needs of the commune members are also diverse. At present, many people's communes have insufficient cash income and feel insufficient funds for expanding reproduction because their sideline production is not good and small native products have not been grasped. Some communes also feel insufficient cash for paying wages. It can be seen that if the people's communes pay attention to developing commodity production in all aspects (small native products are also an important part of it), thereby expanding commodity exchange, it will be beneficial to the development of production and the improvement of life in the people's communes. In fact, as long as sideline production is rapidly developed and expanded and small native products are grasped, the people's communes will be able to rapidly increase cash income, accumulate the necessary funds for expanding reproduction, and solve the problem of inconvenience in the economic life of the commune members. The Neijiang County People's Commune in Sichuan organized a 10,000-person "treasure hunting team" to collect small native products that had been neglected in the past. The entire commune increased its cash income by 250,000 yuan in five days, which was enough to cover the commune's wage expenditure for two months. The Baojing County in Hunan Province organized a "sideline production corps" based on communes to vigorously grasp firewood, charcoal, and collect wild plants. By the end of October 1958, it had earned 320,000 yuan in cash. Each commune used this money to pay the first wages, and the commune members were very happy and their enthusiasm for production was even higher. These vivid facts prove that vigorously grasping small native products is of great benefit to invigorating the rural economy and consolidating and developing the production of the people's communes at present, and it is also imperative. Therefore, the people's communes must not only develop self-sufficient production that directly meets the needs of the commune, but also develop commodity production as widely as possible, including the production of small native products. Only in this way can we expand commodity exchange between the commune and the state, and between communes, so as to meet the diverse needs of the broad masses of the people.

Because the party committees at all levels have begun to pay attention to the production of small native products, the procurement plans for small native products in many areas are rapidly increasing. Some provinces have completed their annual procurement tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets because they grasped this work earlier. However, judging from the overall situation, the completion of the plans in various places is uneven. Many areas have not seriously grasped small native products until now; in these areas, the phenomenon of small native products being scattered and lost, and goods being abandoned on the ground is still relatively common. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explain the principles clearly and quickly grasp the production and procurement of small native products.

Are there conditions for vigorously grasping small native products at present? The "small native groups" on the steel front have entered a new stage of rectification, consolidation, and improvement. The labor force needed for steelmaking can be largely determined, and the tense autumn harvest and autumn planting campaign is about to end in most areas; although various places are still relatively tense in procuring major agricultural products, the potential for labor and transportation is still there; these situations indicate that the favorable conditions for vigorously grasping small native products exist at present.

Since small native products need to be grasped and can be grasped, the remaining question is how to grasp them. Grasping the production and procurement of small native products is not a very complicated matter. The experience of various places proves that as long as this work is uniformly arranged in the production plan around the central work, and the labor force is rationally organized, the production and procurement of small native products can be quickly grasped through everyone's efforts. The problem is that we must do it conscientiously.

Of course, under the unified leadership of the party committee, the commercial departments in various places should also actively and proactively help the people's communes to do a good job in planning sideline production for this winter and next spring, determine the production tasks of small native products by signing purchase contracts, and take a piecemeal approach, combining the procurement of major agricultural products to procure native products more and faster.

    小土产也要大抓一下  
    本报评论员
    小土产在我国农业经济中，占有相当大的比重。它的品种繁多，产量很大，用途也很广泛，和工农业生产以及广大人民日常生活的关系都十分密切。特别是过去长时期被人忽视的各种野生植物如野生纤维、野生油料等，经过加工就可以成为很好的代用品，这对于解决某些工业原料不足的问题是有很大帮助的。让这些小土产登堂入室，大放光彩，为生产和消费服务，显然是一个不可忽视的方面。
    但是，农业大丰收以后，有些人思想上产生了一种轻视小土产的倾向，例如有人认为“农业大丰收，够吃够用了”，“只要抓住大宗农产品就行了”。因而对副业生产表现得不够积极。这种思想已经成为当前不少地区大抓小宗土产工作的一个重要的障碍。能不能认为在农业大丰收以后，就可以放松对小宗土特产品的生产了呢？当然不能。小土产是国民经济各部门所不可缺少的东西。特别是工农业生产大跃进以来，这种情况就看得更清楚了。例如各地在大搞钢铁和兴修水利运动当中需要大量的苇席、木炭、毛竹、棕片、生漆、火硝等土产物资作搭工棚、建厂房、开矿之用；工业上制造酒精、润滑油脂、造纸以及推广绳索牵引进行深翻土地用的绳索等，也都需要大量野生纤维、油料和淀粉做代用原料；没有或缺少这些小土产，就势必影响冬春季工业和农业生产的发展。至于广大人民日常生活当中更是需要多种多样的小土产品，如各种副食品、中药材以及各种日用杂品等等。而当前这些小土产的生产是远不能满足上述各方面的需要的。
    人民公社化以后，用于直接满足本社需要的自给性生产部分大大增加了，这是一个很好的现象。但是，是不是就可以因此而忽视商品性生产了呢？显然是不能够的。因为发展商品性生产，扩大商品交换不仅是国民经济各方面的需要，它更是促进人民公社经济全面发展和促进人民公社巩固的必不可少的条件。今年农业大丰收以后，公社社员在粮食消费方面有了改善和提高，但是社员经济生活的需要也是多方面的。目前，不少人民公社由于副业生产搞得不好，小土产没有抓起来，公社现金收入不多，扩大再生产所必需的资金就感到不足，有些公社发工资也感到现金不足。可见，人民公社如果注意从各方面努力发展商品性生产（小土产也是其中的一个重要部分），从而扩大商品交换，对人民公社发展生产和改善生活都是有好处的。事实上，当前只要迅速发展和扩大副业生产，把小土产抓起来，人民公社就能够迅速地增加现金收入，为扩大再生产积累必需的资金，并解决社员经济生活不方便的问题。四川内江县人民公社组织万人“采宝队”，把过去被忽视的小宗土产收集起来，全社在五天当中就增加了二十五万元的现金收入，足够这个社两个月的工资支出。湖南保靖县以公社为单位组织了一支“副业生产兵团”，大抓木柴、木炭和采集野生植物，到1958年10月底就收入现金三十二万元，各公社用这笔钱发放了第一次工资，社员皆大欢喜，生产劲头更加高涨。这些生动的事实证明，大抓小土产在当前对于活跃农村经济、巩固和发展人民公社生产是大有好处的，也是势在必行的。因此，人民公社在当前既要发展直接满足本社需要的自给性生产，同时又必须尽可能广泛地发展商品性生产，其中也包括小土产的生产。只有这样，才能扩大公社和国家、公社和公社之间的商品交换，从而满足广大人民的多方面的需要。
    由于各级党委开始重视了小土产的生产，许多地区小土产收购计划正在迅速上升，部分省份因为对这一工作抓得较早，目前已经提前超额完成全年的采购任务。但是从总的情况来看，各地完成计划的情况是不平衡的，不少地区直到现在还没有把小土产认真抓起来；在这些地区小土产流散丢失、货弃于地的现象还是比较普遍的。因而必须继续讲清道理，把小土产生产和收购工作迅速抓起来。
    当前有没有条件大抓小土产呢。现在钢铁战线上的“小土群”已经进入了一个以整顿、巩固和提高为主的新阶段，炼钢铁所需要的劳动力大体可以定下来了，紧张的秋收秋种运动在大部分地区即将结束；虽然各地在收购主要农产品方面还比较紧张，但是劳动力、运输力的潜力还是有的；这些情况表明在当前大抓小土产的有利条件是存在的。
    小土产既然需要抓，也可以抓，那么剩下的问题就是怎样去抓了。抓小土产的生产和收购工作，也并不是什么很复杂的事情。各地经验证明，只要围绕中心工作把这一工作统一安排在生产计划之内，并合理地组织劳动力，经过大家的努力，就可以迅速把小土产的生产和收购工作抓起来。问题在于我们要认真地去做。
    当然，各地商业部门也要在党委统一领导下，积极主动地帮助人民公社做好今冬明春的副业生产规划，通过签订购货合同把小土产生产任务确定下来，并采取见缝插针的办法，结合主要农产品的收购，把土产品又多又快地收购上来。
