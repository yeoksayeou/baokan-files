    Masses of the Xining "July 13th" Commune Build a Batch of New Residences

    (Our Dispatch) The first batch of new-style residences suitable for family reunions of men, women, old, and young in Qinghai Province has been completed in the Houzihe residential area of the Xining City "July 13th" People's Commune, and sixty-odd commune members have happily moved into their new homes.

    These new-style residences are earth-wood structure tile-roofed houses arranged in a "mountain" shape. With sturdy blue brick foundations, smooth lime walls, and bright glass doors and windows, they are not only warm in winter and cool in summer and have a beautiful style, but they are also suitable for the habits of the local people. The space enclosed by the houses forms a spacious courtyard, where residents can raise poultry and livestock, or build a garden plot and plant flowers and plants.

    These residences were designed by the Qinghai Provincial Urban Design Institute. After widely soliciting the opinions of the local people, the designers finally selected this type of residence which is loved by farmers, occupies little land, is quick to build, and is low in cost.

    In addition to purchasing a small amount of building materials such as nails, glass, and paint, the construction of these residences was entirely self-funded and self-built by the local people.

    When allocating housing, the commune fully guaranteed the needs of commune members' families to be reunited, regardless of age or gender. Qiu Dengyun's family has a total of five people and received two large rooms and a small suite. The old couple and their two daughters share a large room, the small suite in the bedroom is used as a storage room, and his son, who will marry next Spring Festival, lives alone in a large room.

    Now, the "July 13th" People's Commune has decided to establish a dedicated construction team, preparing to gradually modernize the residences in batches and phases in various residential areas, and to gradually make these residences more like gardens. (Jin Yuanming)

    西宁“七·一三”公社群众自建一批新住宅
    本报讯  青海省第一批适宜每个家庭男女老幼团聚的新式住宅，在西宁市“七·一三”人民公社后子河居民点全部落成，并有六十来户社员喜笑颜开地迁入新居。
    这批新式住宅，系排列成“山”字形的土木结构瓦房。坚固的青砖房基，光滑的石灰墙壁，亮堂的玻璃门窗，不但冬暖夏凉、式样美观，而且适合当地群众的习惯。在被房屋围起来的住室门口，正好形成了一个个空旷的院落，住户可以在这里养些家禽家畜，或是砌个园圃，种些花草。
    这些住宅是由青海省城市设计院负责设计的。设计者在广泛征求了当地群众意见以后，才最后选定了这种农民爱、占地少、修筑快、造价低的住宅形式。
    修建这批住宅除了购买钉子、玻璃、油漆等不多的建筑用材外，其他方面都是由当地群众自筹自建的。
    公社在分配住房时，完全保证了社员家属男女老幼团聚一堂的需要。社员丘登云家共有五口人，分到了两个大间和一个小套间。老俩口和两个女儿合住一个大间，卧室里的小套间作成了储藏室，他的儿子明年春节就要娶媳妇，单独住一个大间。
    现在，“七·一三”人民公社决定要专门成立一个基建队，准备在各个居民点上分批分期地实现居住新式化，并使这些住宅逐步园林化。  （金元明）
