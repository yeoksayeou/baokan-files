Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 24th: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic delivered a speech at a mass rally in Port Said on the afternoon of the 23rd, celebrating the second anniversary of the forced withdrawal of British and French invading forces from Egypt.

In his speech, he ridiculed the imperialists for not daring to reject the Soviet Union's warning against the British, French, and Israeli invasion at the time. Speaking to a large audience at the Port Said Stadium, Nasser said that on October 30, 1956, Egypt received an ultimatum from Britain and France, but the Egyptian government, representing the Egyptian people, rejected this ultimatum. On November 5, the Soviet Union issued a warning to Britain and France, which they could not reject because the Egyptian people knew their goals and principles, while Britain and France were not fighting for any ideals.

President Nasser pointed out that Britain and France invaded Egypt at the time to suppress Arab nationalism. The former British Prime Minister Eden's claim that British troops only wanted to occupy Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez in order to "separate the Egyptian and Israeli forces in combat" was a complete "deception of the people of the world."

Nasser also said that the situation revealed in the disputes in the British Parliament showed that former French Prime Minister Mollet had participated in the conspiracy against Egypt. Documents show that Mollet was a spy for Hitler in 1942 and that Mollet was a traitor at the time.

Recalling the failures of imperialism in the Middle East over the past two years, Nasser said that the Baghdad Pact had collapsed. The Baghdad Pact had been attacking the Arab people since 1955 and had attempted to include the Arab people within its sphere of influence. He also said that the collapse of the Baghdad Pact meant that there was no longer a base for imperialism to attack the Arab people in this region.

Nasser then attacked the Syrian Communist Party as so-called "enemies of unity" and "enemies of Arab nationalism." Nasser attacked "the groups that have emerged against unity," attacking the Syrian Communist Party for "opposing participation in the national union." He then announced that the central government of the UAR had established a committee representing the two regions to supervise and overcome "certain hesitations in the implementation of the work of unification," composed of Vice President Hourani and Boghdadi, as well as Interior Minister Mohieddin.

Nasser also said that he advocated a policy of peace and non-alignment, opposed military alliances and leagues, and opposed dividing the world into spheres of dominance.

Speaking of the UAR's economic construction, Nasser said that after starting the construction of the High Dam, "we plan to open up a basin in the western desert comparable to the Nile River basin. We will use artesian wells and groundwater." He also said that there is good land in the oases, and there are sufficient water sources to irrigate 500,000 feddans or more of land.

Before Nasser's speech, parades of Girl Scouts, commandos, and nurses passed in front of the President's podium.

On the morning of the 23rd, Port Said held a military review. President Nasser also laid a wreath at the Monument to the Unknown Soldier. He also presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for industrial enterprises in this famous city.

    纳赛尔在塞得港发表演说
    嘲笑帝国主义者  攻击叙利亚共产党
    新华社开罗24日电  阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔23日下午在塞得港庆祝英法侵略军被迫撤出埃及两周年群众大会上发表演说。
    他在演说中嘲笑帝国主义者当时不敢拒绝苏联对英、法、以色列三国侵略的警告。纳赛尔在塞得港体育场向人数众多的听众说，1956年10月30日埃及接到了英法的最后通牒，但是埃及政府代表埃及人民拒绝了这个最后通牒：11月5日苏联向英法发出了警告，它们无法拒绝这个警告，因为埃及人民知道自己的目标和原则，而英法却不是为任何理想而战的。
    纳赛尔总统指出，英法当时侵略埃及是为了镇压阿拉伯民族主义。英国前首相艾登说的什么英军只是想占领塞得港、伊士美利亚和苏伊士城，以便把“埃及和以色列在作战的军队隔开”，这完全是“欺骗世界人民的”。
    纳赛尔还说，英国议会发生的争吵中暴露的情况说明，法国前总理摩勒曾经参与反对埃及的共谋。文件说明，摩勒在1942年是希特勒的间谍，摩勒当时是卖国者。
    在追述帝国主义两年来在中东的失败时，纳赛尔说，巴格达条约垮台了，巴格达条约从1955年以来进攻阿拉伯人民，它曾企图把阿拉伯人民包括在它的势力范围以内。他又说，巴格达条约的垮台意味着再没有帝国主义在这个地区进攻阿拉伯人民的基地了。
    纳赛尔接着攻击叙利亚共产党是所谓“统一的敌人”和“阿拉伯民族主义的敌人”。纳赛尔攻击“所出现的反对统一的集团”，攻击叙利亚共产党“反对参加民族联盟”。然后他宣布阿联中央政府已经成立了代表两个地区的一个委员会，以监督和克服“执行统一工作中的某些犹豫情况”，组成的人员为副总统胡拉尼和波格达迪以及内政部长毛希丁。
    纳赛尔还说，他主张和平和不结盟的政策，反对军事联合和同盟，并且反对把世界分割成统治范围。
    在谈到阿联的经济建设的时候，纳赛尔说，在着手修建高水坝以后，“我们计划在西部的沙漠里开辟一个同尼罗河流域媲美的流域。我们将利用自流井和地下水。”他又说，在绿洲里有很好的土地，而且有充足的水源，足以灌溉五十万费丹或更多的土地。
    在纳赛尔演说以前，女童子军、突击队和护士的游行队伍在总统的讲台前通过。
    23日上午，塞得港举行了军事检阅。纳赛尔总统还在无名英雄纪念碑前献了花圈。他还主持了这个著名城市的工业企业的奠基仪式。
