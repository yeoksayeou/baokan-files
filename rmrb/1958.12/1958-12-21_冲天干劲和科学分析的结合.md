The main documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have been published successively. With the exception of the decision, agreed upon by the plenary session, regarding Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal that he not be a candidate for Chairman of the People's Republic of China in the next term, which had already undergone national discussion before its publication, the people of the whole country are discussing the communique of the plenary session and the resolution of the plenary session on several issues concerning the people's communes with great interest.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was held near the end of 1958 and the beginning of 1959. The importance of this time to the people of our country does not need explanation. The plenary session comprehensively assessed the great achievements, great significance, and rich experiences of this year's Great Leap Forward, and on this basis, formulated some of the main targets for industrial and agricultural production next year. According to the session communique, steel production in 1958 will increase by about 5.65 million tons compared to 1957, and in 1959 it will increase by about 7 million tons compared to 1958. This means that the planned increase in production next year will be even greater than the increase this year. The planned increase in coal, grain, and cotton production next year is also similar to the increase this year, with their production reaching approximately 380 million tons, 1050 billion jin, and 100 million dan respectively. From these indicators, it is clear that the 1959 national economic plan will be a grand leap forward plan. Since the industrial front next year will continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward, it is conceivable that the scale of the leap forward in industrial production and construction in our country next year will be even greater than this year.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee affirmed that the Party's general line for socialist construction, which has proven effective in the practice of 1958, is correct. It affirmed that the Party's policy, based on the priority development of heavy industry, of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, and simultaneously developing modern and indigenous methods of production, is correct. It affirmed that the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward in industry, and the policy of combining centralized leadership with mass movements, are correct. Implementing these lines and policies will be the basic guarantee for the continued leap forward of our national economy in 1959. Based on Comrade Mao Zedong's suggestion, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee once again reminded the whole Party to pay serious attention to the principle of strategically despising difficulties and tactically valuing difficulties, to have both soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, to pay serious attention to ensuring that economic plans are based on fully reliable foundations, to maintain appropriate proportions between the development of various sectors of the national economy, and to make economic work as close as possible to or in line with reality. In this way, the national economy in 1959 will not only be able to continue to leap forward, but may leap forward even better.

People always walk on two legs. Combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis is also a matter of walking on two legs. Not only in the current economic construction work are we required to implement the principle of combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, but also in the current people's commune movement are we required to implement the principle of combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis.

In the past few months, the development of the people's commune movement in our country's rural areas has been rapid and smooth. This is because it is not based on the fantasy and orders of a few people, but on the creation of the masses, on the needs of history. It is the product of our country's socialist rectification movement, the Party's general line for socialist construction, and this year's Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. it reflects the demands and aspirations of the vast majority of peasants in our country. In just a few months, the people's communes have demonstrated remarkable superiority in organizing production, distribution, and life, and are playing a powerful life force as a new social organization that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrates government and commune.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee gave extremely high praise to the people's communes. The plenary session affirmed that the people's commune is currently the basic unit of our country's socialist social structure, combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and is a basic unit of socialist political power, and in the future will be the basic unit of our country's communist social structure. The plenary session also affirmed that the people's communes will accelerate the speed of our country's socialist construction and will become the best form for our country to realize the following two transitions, namely, first, the best form for our country's rural areas to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people; and second, the best form for our country to transition from socialism to communism.

The resolution of the plenary session on several issues concerning the people's communes pointed out that the current task of the people of our country is: "Through the social organizational form of the people's commune, according to the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Party, to develop social productive forces at high speed, promote national industrialization, commune industrialization, agricultural mechanization and electrification, gradually transition socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, thereby enabling our country's socialist economy to fully realize ownership by the whole people, and to gradually build our country into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture. In this process, communist factors will inevitably gradually increase, which will lay the foundation for the transition from socialism to communism in terms of both material and spiritual conditions."

However, just as the Great Leap Forward in 1958 once caused some unrealistic and overly impatient ideas, similar ideas have also arisen in the development path of the people's communes. Some comrades have soaring enthusiasm, which is their very important advantage. Their shortcoming is that they lack scientific analysis. They hope that the ownership of the means of production by the whole people can be realized very quickly in the people's communes in the rural areas of the country, and that they can transition to communism very quickly. They do not understand that in order to achieve these goals, there must be a higher level of production development. Prematurely negating collective ownership, prematurely negating the socialist principle of distribution according to work, and prematurely negating commodity production without a higher level of production development can only cause chaos and hinder the development of production, that is, hinder the achievement of their goals. Also based on Comrade Mao Zedong's suggestion, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, in its resolution on the people's communes, pointed out in detail the errors of this tendency, and prescribed a solid and healthy avenue for the further development of the people's communes.

Currently, a series of questions about the nature, policies, and guidelines of the people's communes in our country are related to a fundamental question of our country's transition from socialism to communism. The basic starting point of the plenary session's resolution on this issue is: We are Marxist-Leninist proponents of continuous revolution, and at the same time, we are Marxist-Leninist proponents of the stages of revolutionary development. According to dialectical materialism, everything is in a process of constant change and development. A certain stage in the process of the development of things is interpenetrating and interconnected with its previous and subsequent stages, but they are also mutually different, and each stage has its own qualitative specificity that is different from other stages. According to this point of view, in the past, from the democratic revolution led by the proletariat to the socialist revolution, and now, from socialism to communism, there is no Great Wall separating them, nor should there be. On the contrary, efforts should be made in the previous stage to prepare conditions for the subsequent stage. However, Marxism-Leninism does not allow the mutual confusion of two stages of different natures, nor does it allow the attempt to skip over the previous stage and jump into the subsequent stage based on subjective wishes. In the history of our Party, Chinese Marxists-Leninists represented by Comrade Mao Zedong have always advocated continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, and thus have both opposed rightist tendencies and opposed "leftist" tendencies, enabling the revolution to continuously advance and continuously triumph. During the stage of our country's democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his books "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy," discussed the interrelationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, which are both different and related, criticized the erroneous view that only the democratic revolution is needed and not the socialist revolution, and criticized the so-called "one revolution theory" that attempted to "accomplish everything in one battle" in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. After our country's socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly pointed out that the current task of our Party and the people of the whole country is to build socialism, and to build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. We cannot stagnate in socialist construction, but must continuously increase communist factors in the process of socialist construction; nor can we skip over the socialist stage and jump into the communist stage, but must steadfastly prepare sufficient material conditions and spiritual conditions for the transition to communism in socialist construction. In this way, we can avoid both the error of conservatism and the error of adventurism.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, and based on the principle of combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, thoroughly solved a series of fundamental policy issues currently existing in the people's communes, and pointed out the correct direction for our country's construction of socialism and the transition from socialism to communism. This is the tremendous practical and theoretical significance of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes" passed by the plenary session. Forging ahead valiantly along the road determined by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, we will not only be able to smoothly complete the great economic construction tasks of 1959 and the task of consolidating and strengthening the people's communes, but we will also certainly be able to realize ownership of the means of production by the whole people in the rural areas of the country in three or four years, five or six years, or a few more years, and in fifteen years, twenty years, or a few more, build our country into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, modern and science and culture, laying the foundation for the transition to communism in terms of material and spiritual conditions.

### 冲天干劲和科学分析的结合

    冲天干劲和科学分析的结合
    党的八届六中全会的主要文件已经陆续发表。除了全会同意毛泽东同志提出的关于他不作下届中华人民共和国主席候选人的建议的决定在发表以前已经经过全民讨论以外，全国人民正在以极大的兴趣讨论着全会的公报和全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议。
    八届六中全会是在1958年快要结束、1959年快要开始的时候举行的。这个时间对于我国人民的重要性是用不着解释的。全会全面地估计了今年的大跃进的伟大成就、伟大意义和丰富经验，并且在这个基础上拟定了明年的工农业生产的一些主要指标。根据会议公报，钢产量1958年将比1957年增产五百六十五万吨左右，而1959年将比1958年增产七百万吨左右。这就是说，明年的计划增产量将比今年的增产量更大。明年的煤炭、粮食、棉花的计划增产量也跟今年的增产量差不多，它们的产量将分别达到三亿八千万吨左右、一万零五百亿斤左右、一亿担左右。从这些指标看来，很明显，1959年的国民经济计划将是一个宏伟的跃进计划。由于明年的工业战线将继续执行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，可以想像，明年我国工业生产和建设的跃进的规模将比今年还要伟大。
    八届六中全会肯定了在1958年的实践中证明有效的党的社会主义建设总路线是正确的，肯定了党的在优先发展重工业的基础上实行工业和农业并举、重工业和轻工业并举、中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举、洋法生产和土法生产并举的方针是正确的，肯定了工业中的以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针和集中领导同群众运动相结合的方针是正确的。贯彻执行这些路线和方针，将是1959年我国国民经济继续跃进的基本保证。八届六中全会根据毛泽东同志的建议，再一次提醒全党认真注意在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难，既要有冲天干劲，又要有科学分析的原则，认真注意使经济计划建立在充分可靠的基础上，使国民经济各部门的发展相互保持适当的比例，使经济工作尽可能地接近实际或者符合实际。这样，1959年的国民经济将不但能够继续跃进，而且可能跃进得更好。
    人们走路总是要用两条腿。冲天干劲和科学分析相结合，也是一个用两条腿走路的问题。不但在当前的经济建设工作中，要求我们实行冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的原则，而且在当前的人民公社运动中，也要求我们实行冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的原则。
    在过去的几个月中，我国农村人民公社运动的发展是迅速而顺利的。这是因为不是出于少数人的空想和命令，而是出于群众的创造，出于历史的需要。它是我国的社会主义整风运动、社会主义建设总路线和今年社会主义建设大跃进的产物，它反映了我国绝大多数农民群众的要求和愿望。仅仅在几个月的时间内，人民公社就在组织生产、分配和生活等方面表现了显著的优越性，正在发挥它作为工农商学兵相互结合和政社合一的新的社会组织的强大的生命力。
    八届六中全会对人民公社给予极高的评价。全会肯定了人民公社在现阶段是我国社会主义社会结构的工农商学兵相结合的和社会主义政权组织的基层单位，在将来是我国共产主义社会结构的基层单位。全会也肯定了人民公社将加快我国社会主义建设的速度，并且将成为我国实现下述两个过渡的最好的形式，即第一，成为我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的最好的形式；第二，成为我国由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好的形式。
    全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议指出，我国人民现阶段的任务是：“经过人民公社这种社会组织形式，根据党所提出的社会主义建设的总路线，高速度地发展社会生产力，促进国家工业化、公社工业化、农业机械化电气化，逐步地使社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，从而使我国的社会主义经济全面地实现全民所有制，逐步地把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。在这一过程中，共产主义的因素必将逐步增长，这就将在物质条件方面和精神条件方面为社会主义过渡到共产主义奠定基础。”
    但是，如同1958年的大跃进曾经引起某些不切实际的过于性急的想法一样，在人民公社的发展道路方面，也曾经引起类似的想法。有一些同志有冲天的干劲，这是他们的非常重要的优点。他们的缺点是比较缺少科学分析。他们希望很快就可以在全国农村的人民公社中实现生产资料的全民所有制，而且希望很快就可以过渡到共产主义。他们不了解，为了达到这些目的，必须有更高的生产发展水平，没有更高的生产发展水平而过早地否定集体所有制，过早地否定按劳分配的社会主义原则，过早地否定商品生产，就只能引起混乱，妨碍生产的发展，也就是说，妨碍达到他们的目的。也是根据毛泽东同志的建议，八届六中全会在关于人民公社的决议中，详细地指出了这种倾向的错误，并且为人民公社的进一步发展规定了坚实的健全的康庄大道。
      目前我国关于人民公社的性质、政策和方针的一系列问题，关系到我国由社会主义向共产主义过渡的这样一个根本性质的问题。对于这个问题，全会决议的基本出发点是：我们是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者，同时又是马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论者。根据辩证唯物主义，一切事物无不在不断变化、发展的过程中。事物发展过程中的某一阶段同它的前一阶段和后一阶段是互相渗透和互相联系的，但是彼此又互相区别，每一阶段都有它自己的不同于其他阶段的质的规定性。根据这个观点，在过去，从无产阶级领导的民主革命到社会主义革命，在现在，从社会主义到共产主义，它们中间没有隔着也不应当隔着万里长城，相反的，应当在前一阶段中努力为后一阶段准备条件。但是，马克思列宁主义不容许把两个不同性质的阶段互相混淆起来，也不容许根据主观的愿望企图超越前一阶段而跳入后一阶段。在我们党的历史上，以毛泽东同志为代表的中国的马克思列宁主义者从来就是主张不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的，因而既反对了右的倾向，又反对了“左”的倾向，使革命得以不断前进和不断胜利。在我国民主革命阶段中，毛泽东同志在“中国革命与中国共产党”和“新民主主义论”两书中，就曾经论述了民主革命和社会主义革命的既有区别又有联系的相互关系，批判了那种认为只要民主革命而不要社会主义革命的错误观点，和企图把民主革命和社会主义革命“毕其功于一役”的所谓“一次革命论”。在我国社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利以后，党中央和毛泽东同志曾经多次指出，我们党和全国人民现阶段的任务是建设社会主义，把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。我们既不能在社会主义建设中停顿不前，而要在社会主义建设的过程中使共产主义的因素不断增长；又不能超越社会主义阶段而跳入共产主义阶段，而要踏踏实实地在社会主义建设中为向共产主义过渡准备充分的物质条件和精神条件。这样就使我们既能不犯保守主义的错误，又能不犯冒险主义的错误。
    毛泽东同志主持的党的八届六中全会，根据马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论，根据冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的原则，透彻地解决了人民公社目前存在的一系列根本政策问题，并且为我国建设社会主义和从社会主义过渡到共产主义指出了正确的方向。这就是全会通过的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的巨大的实践意义和理论意义。沿着八届六中全会所决定的道路奋勇前进，我们将不但能够顺利地完成1959年的伟大的经济建设任务和整顿巩固人民公社的任务，而且一定能够在三四年、五六年或者更多一些的时间中在全国农村中实现生产资料的全民所有制，并且在十五年、二十年或者更多一些的时间中，把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，在物质条件和精神条件方面为过渡到共产主义奠定基础。
