    Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant Solves Contradiction Between Workers' Production and Learning
    Increased Study Time, Production Unaffected
    (Our Dispatch) The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant has implemented a new method of spare-time study since the workshops began running schools. This method has resolved the long-standing contradiction between production, various activities, and learning, enabling the vigorous development of education for all workers in the plant and creating a new atmosphere of "three satisfactions" for leading cadres, workers, and teachers, and "four guarantees" for production, learning, activities, and rest. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site conference on factory and mine-run schools in this plant to promote this spare-time learning method.
    Since the establishment of schools in the workshops, this plant has quickly established five "red and expert" schools ranging from senior primary to senior high school, and everyone has been finding ways to resolve the contradiction between production and learning. After the machining workshop set up a school, all employees, under the leadership of the Party branch, began by changing the production organization, discussed and determined the learning format, and changed the original three-shift system of eight hours of production per shift to a three-shift system of five, eight, and eleven hours. Workers in shift A produced for five hours, then studied, continuing this for six days, then a major shift change occurred, rotating the learning. After the experiment proved effective, it was promoted to all workshops; the forging and riveting workshop, based on the production characteristics of the department, formulated and implemented the "six, eight, ten" system. The establishment of these two learning organizational forms in this plant fixed the production and learning time, which ensured both the completion of production tasks and the guarantee of learning time.
    The implementation of this method has ensured production, learning, rest, and activities. In the past, the biggest concern for the plant's leading cadres was that production and learning often competed for time, and the workers' cultural level improved slowly. After promoting factory-run schools, the above new learning methods were adopted, and leading personnel from the plant level to the workshop level were responsible for leadership at all levels, uniformly arranging production and education. In the past, workers had a maximum of six hours of study per week, and this was often taken up by other work. Now, there is a fixed study time each week. In the past, the study time was too short, and it was intermittent, the attendance rate was very low, the teaching effect was very poor, and both teachers and students had opinions. Now, students' study time is concentrated, their energy is concentrated, and teachers can also properly arrange teaching, which has improved the quality of teaching. The student attendance rate has reached 100%. Teachers say: In the past, the class was an "empty city strategy," but now it is a "full house." Workers reflect that there is ample time for learning, they learn quickly, and they remember well.
    Because the production and learning time is properly arranged, various activities and rest are also guaranteed accordingly. In the past, various activities often clashed with learning, neglecting one thing and losing the other, and workers felt tired after work. Now, some political activities are carried out after class or in conjunction with political classes. In addition to production and learning, workers participating in learning also have ample time to rest, entertain, and do housework.
    After the implementation of this method, the plant freed up a large number of workers to participate in learning, and the number of students enrolled increased sharply from more than 2,000 to more than 6,300, reaching more than 95% of the total number of workers in the plant. The increase in study time has not affected production; in the context of a continuous increase in production tasks in October and November, the plant overfulfilled its production tasks.

    太原矿山机器厂解决了工人生产和学习的矛盾 
    学习时间增多  生产不受影响
    本报讯  太原矿山机器厂车间办学后，实行了一种业余学习的新办法。这种办法解决了长期以来生产、各项活动和学习之间的矛盾，使全厂职工教育得到蓬勃开展，出现了领导干部、职工和教师“三满意”，生产、学习、活动、休息“四保证”的新气象。最近，中共山西省委在这个厂举行了全省厂矿办学现场会议，推广这种业余学习的办法。
    这个厂在车间办学以来，很快地建立起从高小到高中的五所红专学校，并且人人想办法，解决生产与学习矛盾。加工车间办起学校以后，全体职工在党支部领导下，从改变生产组织着手，讨论确定了学习形式，把原来每班生产时间八小时的三班倒改为五、八、十一的三班倒。甲班工人生产五小时，然后学习，这样持续学习六天，然后大倒班，轮流学习。经试验后效果良好，推广到各车间；锻铆车间又根据本部门的生产特点，制定和推行了“六、八、十”制。这个厂建立这两种学习组织形式，把生产和学习时间固定下来，既能完成生产任务，又能使学习时间得到保证。
    实行这种办法，使生产、学习、休息、活动都有了保证。过去厂的领导干部最大的苦恼是，生产和学习常有争时间的现象，职工文化水平提高较慢。推行了车间办学后，采取了以上新的学习办法，从厂级到车间的领导人员层层负责领导，统一安排生产和教育。过去职工每周学习时间最多有六小时，还常常被其它工作占用。现在，每周有了固定的学习时间。过去学习时间太短，并且时断时续，学习出席率很低，教学效果很差，教师学员都有意见。现在学员学习时间集中，精力集中，教师也能够妥善安排教学，提高了教学质量。学员学习出席率达到了百分之百。教师说：过去上课是“空城计”，现在是“满堂红”。职工反映，学习时间充足了，学得快，又记得牢。
    由于生产、学习时间安排得当，各项活动和休息也随着得到保证。过去各项活动经常与学习打架，顾此失彼，职工下班后学习也感到疲乏。现在，有些政治活动在课外或结合政治课进行。参加学习的职工除了生产、学习以外，还有充足的时间休息、娱乐、搞家务。
    实行这个办法后，全厂腾出了大批工人参加学习，入学人数由两千多人激增到六千三百多人，达到了全厂职工总数的95％以上。学习时间增多了并未影响生产，在10、11两个月生产任务不断增大的情况下，全厂生产任务超额完成。
