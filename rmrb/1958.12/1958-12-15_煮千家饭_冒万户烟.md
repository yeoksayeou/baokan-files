Since ancient times, it seemed a matter of course that women revolved around the cooking stove. Now, in the vast rural areas and cities of our country, with the development of the people's commune movement, countless public canteens have emerged. In these socialist living collectives, there are also thousands upon thousands of women revolving around the cooking stove day and night. They are still dealing with firewood, rice, oil, and salt every day, but this labor already has a completely different and new content from the past.

They are cooking for thousands of families and burning fuel for tens of thousands of homes. They have already moved from the narrow circle of household chores to a broader world, toiling all day long for the collective living welfare of thousands of people.

At the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference, many, many such people can be found. "Cook" is the title they cherish in their hearts; "Socialist Construction Activist" is the glorious title the people give them.

"Cooks are clever, the food they cook is fragrant and delicious, men and women, young and old, are busy with production, and life is improved, everyone is happy," the members of the Fourth Platoon of the Fourth Battalion of the Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, composed such a song to praise the cooks of their canteen. This canteen originally only had twelve households eating, with rations portioned out for each person to take home. After the establishment of the people's commune in August, free meals were implemented, and forty-five households, more than a hundred people, came to the canteen to eat. Cook Diao Songjia was very happy to see her canteen growing bigger and bigger, with meals as lively as a celebration every day, with more than a hundred people talking and laughing. She was determined to be a cook for life and to run the canteen even better. She and the other two cooks often held brainstorming sessions with the elder women to learn how to make good home-style meals, solicit opinions from the commune members, and in a few months, they summarized nine experiences, making three or four kinds of meals every time, making every commune member satisfied.

Diao Songjia and her colleagues not only run the daily meals in the canteen well, but also achieve "logistics first," serving production thoughtfully. Wherever the commune members go to engage in shock production, they go to cook, with the slogan: "Production charges forward, camps are set up in the fields, soldiers guard the positions, and the canteen follows behind." In October of this year, more than forty people from the production team went to rush-plant wheat five or six miles away, and Diao Songjia went with rice, vegetables, and tableware. Later, she thought: Although the commune members are engaged in shock production outside, even if it's only for three days, I can't give them rice every meal; I should change the variety to adjust the taste so that everyone is happy and works harder. The next day, after breakfast, she went back to the vegetable garden and shoveled more than twenty catties of yellow-hearted cabbage, and prepared fifty catties of buckwheat flour, and used small jars to hold lard, and carried it away in a load. For lunch that day, she made buckwheat dumpling soup with tender yellow-hearted cabbage, which was fragrant and delicious, and the commune members ate it with a smile, and everyone was happy. In the past, when this place did not have a canteen, when farmers went to plant crops far away, it was like fleeing a famine, with each person bringing some rice to cook together, and eating only pickles, sometimes full and sometimes hungry. But now, the canteen follows them closely, and someone delivers tea and water to the fields every day, and eating and drinking is just like at home, so of course they are more energetic.

Serving the laborers, serving those who engage in production, this is the common wish of the cooks. Some people have to switch from their original positions as producers to do this kind of serving work, but they have gained greater honor in their new ordinary labor. The canteen run by Xiong Huifang, a housewife in Harbin, was therefore rated as a red flag of public canteens and collective catering units in the city.

Xiong Huifang has a good skill in weaving mats. In July of this year, she joined the newly established reed mat factory in the street, and she once rejoiced that she had become a worker directly engaged in production. But now she has given up her beloved weaving production and returned to the cooking stove. At first, she herself couldn't figure it out. However, the party's education brightened her eyes, and she began to understand the infinite joy of one person's hard work and everyone's happiness. She thought that although she could weave mats, she could only weave two large mats a day at most. If she could free up the time for eighteen women to cook three meals a day, they could weave eighteen more large mats a day, which would both support socialist construction and help everyone increase their income. Therefore, she made up her mind to sign up to be a cook and persuaded another housewife, Du Guizhi, to work in the canteen with her.

In Xiong Huifang's canteen, together with the workers who weave mats, there are a total of twenty-two households and more than one hundred and twenty people. In order to make everyone satisfied, Xiong Huifang came up with many methods. The most commendable thing is that they implemented a meal reservation and home delivery system in the canteen. With more than one hundred and twenty people, everyone has different tastes. Whoever wants to eat rice, whoever wants to eat sorghum porridge, as long as they tell them in advance, everyone's needs can be met, and even a family can eat several kinds of meals in one meal. They also deliver meals to each household in batches according to the different work and study times of these more than one hundred people, three meals a day, every meal. In the early morning at four o'clock, before dawn, the porters on the early shift ate the steaming meals they delivered, and also took away the cooked lunch. At this time, the family members who had been weaving mats all night were still sleeping peacefully in bed, without having to worry at all.

Xiong Huifang and her colleagues use their hard work to exchange for other people's peace and happiness. She said: "Being a cook in the canteen is also cooking, but it is fundamentally different from cooking at home in the past. In the past, it was for oneself, for the family; now it is for everyone, for socialism." Therefore, although she is no longer a weaving worker, she is determined to be a "cooking expert."

However, in any case, from cooking for one family to cooking for dozens or hundreds of people, this is a difficult problem for women after all! Who can accept this task without feeling some anxiety at the beginning? Yi Xiuying, a female member of the Junshan People's Commune in Yueyang County, Hunan Province, was elected by everyone as the cook of the production brigade's canteen in September of this year. At that time, she thought: The old saying goes, "Even dogs hate being in charge for three years." With the food of more than five hundred people, with so many people and different tastes, if things are not done well, she will be scolded and aggrieved every day. However, the party educated her, saying that she was a woman from a poor peasant background, and now that communes and canteens are being established, people like her are needed to be in charge and seek welfare for everyone. As long as she shows the demeanor of being in charge, there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome. The Party's words touched Yi Xiuying's heart, and later facts proved that her sense of inferiority was completely superfluous.

Yi Xiuying's canteen only has five cooks, in addition to a male semi-laborer, the rest are all women. It is these five people who supply meals to more than five hundred people. They also try their best to improve everyone's meals. The rice must achieve "five withouts": no husks, no sand, no raw rice, no barnyard grass, no debris; the dishes must achieve "four appropriates": appropriate saltiness, appropriate quantity, appropriate seasoning, appropriate matching, and a total of more than one hundred kinds of different cooking styles can be made. In addition, they also plant vegetables, raise chickens, raise pigs, and raise fish. As long as it is needed to run the canteen well, they have planned for it. Such a large household chore is handled in an orderly manner in the hands of Yi Xiuying and her colleagues, and everyone is satisfied. The commune members composed songs, saying that the people's commune is a paradise, and the canteen is a "flower bed in paradise."

From a virtuous housewife in an ordinary farming family to the head of a collective living group of dozens or hundreds of people, this not only tests the intelligence and talent of women, but more importantly, exercises their collectivist thinking. When they are housewives of a family, they love their children, husbands, and old people so much, arranging food and clothing for them, and tasting all the hardships for them. Now, in the big family of the people's commune, they not only love their own families and their own relatives, but also love everyone and the collective like their own flesh and blood, and inject all their efforts into the collective cause. These more virtuous and great women, how pure and noble their feelings are! Cai Zhenmei, an excellent cook in Jinping County, Yunnan Province, is so meticulous in her care for others that she is more dear than a relative. Every day, she makes several kinds of meals according to the different needs of young people, middle-aged people, old people, and children, so that they can eat as comfortably as at home. The canteen often uses peanuts to cook, and she fries them in oil and sprinkles them with salted coke for young people to eat, boils them until they are soft for the little babies to eat, and also grinds some peanut powder for the elderly who can't chew peanuts. Several old women in the village can't help but smile when they see her delivering food, and treat her as their own daughter. An old man named Gao Shunsheng suffered from cough and asthma. He was afraid that eating sow meat in the canteen would cause a relapse of his old illness, so he cooked at home alone. Cai Zhenmei thought, "How can we let him worry about eating and drinking alone when we are all one big family?" So she went to see him and said, "I'll make whatever you want to eat. I'll cook what you can't eat in a separate pot for you." The old man entered the canteen with some doubts. Sure enough, the old man Gao liked to eat peanuts, so Cai Zhenmei often made them for him. When the canteen ate pork, she would pick out boar meat to stir-fry for him. The old man Gao was very happy, so he ate in the canteen wholeheartedly.

In September of the lunar calendar this year, Wang Meifen, a twenty-one-year-old woman in the village, gave birth to a baby. Cai Zhenmei would use Jiangmi wine to cook three eggs and bring them to her as soon as it dawned every morning. After the lying-in woman had breakfast, she would cook some good dishes for the lying-in woman alone for three meals a day. When the canteen fried chicken, she would pick some chicken legs and chicken breasts to make soup and add noodles for the lying-in woman and the elderly to eat. Wang Meifen liked to eat hard rice, so she patiently persuaded her: You just gave birth to a baby, your stomach is weak and you can't eat hard rice. Eat some soft rice first, and eat it when you are a full month old! The lying-in woman was very moved and took Cai Zhenmei's hand and said: I have been at ease this month. The canteen always brings hot meals. I eat well, and my milk is full. When I gave birth to my first baby, I went to the ground to cook myself in two days. I didn't have good things to eat, and my milk was dry, and the baby was as skinny as a monkey.

People who love others will naturally be loved by others. Diao Songjia, Xiong Huifang, Yi Xiuying, Cai Zhenmei, these ordinary working women are now enjoying the glory that people give them.

Because they are all people who are worthy of people's trust, and they are also worthy of people's praise.

    煮千家饭  冒万户烟
    自古以来，妇女围着锅台转，似乎是天经地义的事情。现在，在我们国家的广大农村和城市里，随着人民公社化运动的开展，出现了无数的公共食堂。在这些社会主义的生活大集体中，又有成千上万的妇女日日夜夜围着锅台转。她们同样是每天和柴米油盐打交道，但是这种劳动却已经有着和过去完全不同的崭新的内容。
    她们煮的是千家饭，烧的是万户烟。她们已经从狭小的家务劳动的圈子里走到一个更加广阔的天地中来，为千千万万人的集体生活福利而终日操劳。
    在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议上，可以找到很多很多这样的人。“炊事员”，这是她们自己所心爱的职衔；“建设社会主义积极分子”，这是人民送给她们的光荣称号。
    “炊事员点子强，煮出饭来喷喷香，男女老少忙生产，生活改善喜洋洋。”安徽省舒城县舒茶人民公社第四营第四排的社员们，编了这样一个歌子来称赞自己食堂的炊事员们。这个食堂原先只有十二户人家吃饭，每人定量打回家去吃，8月间人民公社成立以后，实行了吃饭不要钱，有四十五户、一百多人到食堂吃饭。炊事员刁松甲看到自己的食堂越办越大，天天吃饭像办喜事一样的热闹，一百多人有说有笑，心里非常高兴。她下决心要当一辈子的炊事员，把食堂办得更好。她和另外两个炊事员时常找大婶、大娘们开献计会，学习怎样做好家常饭菜，向社员征求意见，在短短几个月当中，总结出九条经验，餐餐能做出三、四样饭食，使社员个个满意。
    刁松甲她们不仅办好食堂里日常的饭菜，还做到了“兵马未动，粮草先行”，很周到地为生产服务。社员们到哪里突击生产，她们就到哪儿做饭，口号是：“生产打冲锋，田头扎营棚，战士守阵地，食堂后边跟。”今年10月，生产队有四十多个人到五、六里地之外抢种小麦，刁松甲就带着米、菜和碗筷跟去了。后来，她又想：社员在外突击生产，虽说只有三天功夫，我也不能给他们顿顿吃米饭，应该换花样调调口味，好让大家吃着高兴，干得更起劲。第二天开罢早饭，她就回去先在菜园里铲了二十多斤黄心菜，再预备出五十斤荞麦粉，用小罐盛上猪油，一担挑走了。这天中午饭，她做的是荞麦粉汤团，放上嫩嫩的黄心菜，又香又鲜，社员们一边吃一边乐呵呵的，没有一个不欢喜。这个地方过去没有成立食堂时，农民们到远处种庄稼就像逃荒一样，一人带点米凑到一起煮饭，就点咸菜，饱一顿饿一餐的。而现在，食堂紧紧跟着他们，每天有人朝地里送茶送水，吃喝就像在家里一样，当然是越干越有精神了。
    侍候劳动者，侍候生产的人，这是炊事员们所共有的心愿。有的人为此而不得不从本来的生产者的岗位上转来做这种侍候人的工作，但她们在新的平凡劳动里，却获得了更大的荣誉。哈尔滨市一位家庭妇女熊惠芳所经营的食堂，就因此被评为全市公共食堂和集体伙食单位的一面红旗。
    熊惠芳有一副织席的好手艺，今年7月，她参加了街道上新办的苇席工厂，她曾经为此庆幸自己成了一名直接参加生产的工人。可是如今她却放弃了自己心爱的织席生产，又回到锅台边来。一开始，她自己也是有些想不通的。然而党的教育使她擦亮了眼睛，她开始懂得了一人辛苦、众人幸福的无穷乐趣。她想，自己虽然会织席，可究竟一天最多也只能织出两领大席子，如果能让十八户的妇女都把一天做三顿饭的时间腾出来，一天就能多织出十八领大席子，这样既支援了社会主义建设，又能帮助大家增加收入。因此便拿定主意报名去当炊事员，并且劝说另一位家庭妇女杜桂芝，也同她一起到食堂里工作。
    在熊惠芳她们食堂里吃饭的，连织席的工人在一起，一共有二十二户、一百二十多口人。熊惠芳为了要人人吃得满意，想出了许多办法。最难能可贵的是她们在食堂里实行了预约售饭和送饭到家的办法。一百多口人，人人口味不同，谁要吃大米饭，谁要吃高粱米粥，只要事前告诉一声，都能满足大家的要求，甚至一家人一顿要吃几样的饭，也都可以办到。她们又按照这一百多人不同的劳动和学习时间，每餐都分批把饭菜送到各人家里，一日三餐，餐餐如此。清晨四点多钟，天还没有亮。上早班的搬运工人就吃上了她们送来的热气腾腾的饭，还带走了煮好的午饭，这时，编了一夜席子的工人家属们还安静地睡在床上，一点也不用费神。
    熊惠芳她们就是这样用自己的辛苦去换来别人的安乐和幸福。她说：“到食堂当炊事员虽然也是做饭，但是和过去在家里做饭可根本不一样，过去那是为自己，为一家；现在是为大家，为社会主义。”因此，尽管她如今已不是一名织席工人，可她却决心要做一个“做饭专家”。
    不过，无论如何，从做一家一灶的饭到做几十口、几百口人的饭，这对于妇女们毕竟是个难题啊！有谁能在开始接受这份任务的时候，不为此而感到一些焦虑呢？湖南省岳阳县君山人民公社女社员易秀英，今年9月被大家推选为生产大队食堂的炊事员，那时，她就曾想着：老话说：“当家三年狗都嫌”，五百多人的伙食，人多口杂，搞不好定会每日里挨骂受气。但是，党教育了她，说她是贫农出身的妇女，现在办公社，办食堂，正是需要像她这样的人出来当家作主，为大家谋福利，只要拿出当家作主的气派来，便没有克服不了的困难。党的这些话打动了易秀英的心，而后来的事实也证明她的自卑感完全是多余的。
    易秀英的食堂只有五个炊事员，除了一个男的半劳力以外，其余全是妇女。就是她们这五个人，却供应五百多人吃饭。她们还想尽各种办法来改善大家的伙食。饭要做到“五无”：无谷、无砂、无生饭、无稗子、无杂物；菜要做到“四适当”：咸淡适当、数量适当、调味适当、搭配适当，一共能做出一百多种吃法式样不同的菜来。另外，还加上种菜、养鸡、喂猪、养鱼，只要是办好食堂所需要的，她们都筹划到了。这样大的家务，在易秀英她们手里却被操持得有条有理，人人吃得满意。社员们编了歌子，说人民公社是天堂，食堂就是“天堂中的花坛”。
    从一个普通农家的贤良主妇，到几十人几百人生活集体的当家人，这不仅考验了妇女们的聪明才干，而且更重要的是锻炼了她们的集体主义的思想。当她们作为一个家庭的主妇的时候，她们是那样地爱自己的孩子、丈夫和老人，给他们安排吃穿，为他们尝尽了辛苦。现在，在人民公社的大家庭里，她们不仅仅爱自己的家，爱自己的亲人，而且像亲骨肉一般地爱大家，爱集体，把自己的心血全部注入集体的事业中。这些更贤良、伟大的女性，她们的感情是多么纯洁而高尚啊！云南省金平县有一位优秀的炊事员，叫做蔡贞妹，她对别人那样无微不至的体贴照顾，真是比亲人还要亲。每天，她根据青年、中年、老人、小孩不同的需要，做出好些种饭菜，让他们吃得像在家里一样随心如意。食堂里常常用花生做菜，她就用油炸了再撒上焦盐给年轻人吃，煮烂了给小娃娃们吃，还舂些花生粉，给嚼不动花生的老年人吃。村里几个老婆婆一看到她送饭来了，就不由得眉开眼笑，拿她当自己的亲女儿看待。有个高顺生老爹爹得过咳喘病，他怕入食堂吃母猪肉会旧病复发，一个人在家做饭。蔡贞妹心想“团团的一大家人，怎么能让他老人独自为吃喝操心呢？”便去看他，对他说：你想吃什么我就做什么，不能吃的我隔锅烧给你吃。老爹爹将信将疑地入了食堂。果然，高老爹爱吃花生，蔡贞妹便时常给他做；食堂吃猪肉时，就单挑公猪肉炒给他吃。高老爹非常高兴，就一心一意在食堂吃饭了。
    今年农历9月，村里二十一岁的王美芬生了娃娃。蔡贞妹每天早上天一亮，便用江米酒煮三只鸡蛋端去，等产妇吃过早点，再给大家开饭，一天三顿也单给产妇做点好菜。食堂炒鸡时，她就挑些鸡腿、鸡胸脯熬汤下挂面给产妇和老年人吃。王美芬喜欢吃硬饭，她就耐心地劝说：你刚生小娃娃，肚子弱吃不得硬的，先吃些软饭，等满月再吃吧！产妇十分感动，拉着蔡贞妹的手说：“我这一个月放宽了心，总是食堂送来热呼呼的饭菜，吃得好，奶水涨的不行。我生第一个娃娃时，两天就下地自己做饭，没有好东西吃，奶干瘪瘪的，小娃饿的像个瘦猴子。”
    热爱别人的人，自然会同样受到别人的热爱。刁松甲、熊惠芳、易秀英、蔡贞妹，这些平凡的劳动妇女，如今正享有人们给予的应有的光荣。
    因为她们都是些值得人们信赖的人，也是值得人们歌颂的人。
