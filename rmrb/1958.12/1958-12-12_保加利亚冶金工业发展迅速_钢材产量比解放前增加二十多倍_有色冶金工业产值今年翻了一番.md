Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 7th December: The second blast furnace at the Bulgarian Lenin Metallurgical Plant began trial production on the 6th, producing its first batch of iron. This blast furnace has a production capacity of 117,000 tons per year and was built with the assistance of Soviet experts. The formal commissioning of this blast furnace will usher in a new stage in the development of Bulgaria's ferrous metallurgical industry.

During the period of the People's government, Bulgaria's steel industry has developed very rapidly. Before liberation, Bulgaria produced only 4,000 tons of steel annually, while in the first nine months of this year, it produced more than 154,400 tons of steel and 100,211 tons of steel products.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 8th December: The Damyanov Copper Smelting Complex, located near Pirdop, was put into operation twenty-seven days ahead of schedule. This is a newly built factory. Initially, its production capacity is 8,000 tons of electrolytic copper, 30,000 tons of sulfuric acid, and 12,000 tons of copper sulfate. In the next two to three years, the factory's production capacity will double.

Chairman Yugov of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers attended the opening ceremony of the factory. In his speech, he warmly congratulated the factory on its early completion and commissioning, and sincerely thanked the Soviet government and Soviet experts for their fraternal selfless assistance.

Speaking of the great achievements made by Bulgaria's non-ferrous metallurgical industry, Yugov said that in 1939 Bulgaria did not have even one kilogram of selected ore, but now it has 303,000 tons of selected zinc, lead, copper and pyrite, and has mined 19,000 tons of lead, 7,513 tons of zinc, and 562,000 tons of copper ore.

This year, the value of products from the non-ferrous metallurgical industry is 1,599.7 million leva (Bulgarian currency), an increase of 115.5% compared with 1957.

    保加利亚冶金工业发展迅速
    钢材产量比解放前增加二十多倍
    有色冶金工业产值今年翻了一番
    据新华社索非亚7日电  保加利亚列宁冶金工厂第二座高炉6日开始试验生产，炼出了第一炉铁。这座高炉的生产能力为年产量十一万七千吨，它是在苏联专家帮助下建成的。这座高炉正式投入生产后将使保加利亚黑色冶金工业的发展进入一个新的阶段。
    在人民政权时期，保加利亚的钢铁工业发展非常迅速。解放前，保加利亚每年生产的钢材不过四千吨，而今年头九个月就生产了钢十五万四千多吨，钢材十万零二千一百多吨。
    据新华社索非亚8日电  位于皮尔多普城附近的达米扬诺夫炼铜联合企业提前二十七天投入了生产。这是一座新建的工厂。初期它的生产能力为八千吨电解铜，三万吨硫酸，一万二千吨硫酸铜。在今后两三年中工厂的生产能力将增加一倍。
    保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫出席了这个工厂的开工典礼。他在讲话中热烈祝贺工厂提前建成和投入生产，并衷心感谢苏联政府和苏联专家的兄弟般的无私援助。
    于哥夫在谈到保加利亚有色冶金工业所取得的巨大成就时说，1939年保加利亚连一公斤的精选矿也没有，而现在已有三十万零三千吨锌、铅、铜和黄铁矿的精选矿，已开采了一万九千吨铅，七千五百一十三吨锌，五十六万二千吨铜矿。
    今年，有色冶金工业的产品价值为十五亿九千九百七十万列弗（保币），比1957年增加了115.5％。
