Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 16th: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a communiqué on the visit of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stating: During its visit to Vietnam, the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria held cordial talks with the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the talks, both sides discussed current international issues and issues related to the relations between the two countries, and reached complete agreement on these issues.

The communiqué stated that the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced its firm support for the Algerian people's national liberation struggle and expressed its belief that their struggle would achieve final victory.

The communiqué stated that both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Algeria have suffered from colonial rule in the past, and are now standing together in the large family of Asian and African countries against colonialism. Therefore, the two sides have a deep understanding of each other and a brotherly feeling of solidarity.

The communiqué said, "Both sides are pleased to see that in recent years, the movement against colonialism, for national liberation, and for the defense of world peace has become increasingly developed. After the historically significant Bandung Conference, the Cairo Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and several conferences of African countries held in Accra, the movement of Asian and African countries against colonialism and for the attainment and defense of national independence is surging. After imperialism was driven out of some Asian and African countries, they are still persisting in the 'policy of strength,' attempting to remain in Africa. They are stepping up their arms expansion, blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and plotting subversion in many countries. They are stubbornly continuing to test nuclear weapons, continuing to create tension, and pushing mankind to the brink of war. They are colluding with each other, and disregarding human rights and international law, brutally suppressing the national liberation movements in colonial countries. Their blatant war conspiracies and barbaric acts of terrorism have been severely condemned. The people of Asian and African countries, with a tradition of heroic struggle, with the support of the people of socialist countries and peace-loving people of the world, will defeat the conspiracies of imperialism and achieve complete independence. Facts have proved that international solidarity against colonialism, especially the solidarity between Asian and African countries and socialist countries, is an important factor in accelerating the demise of colonialism."

The communiqué also stated: "Both sides believe that Algeria's achievement of independence is not only the legitimate national right of the Algerian people, but also has important significance for the whole world, especially for Africa and Asia."

    越南政府发表阿尔及利亚代表团访问公报
    越阿两国并肩反对殖民主义
    新华社河内16日电  越南民主共和国政府今天就阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团访问越南民主共和国发表公报说：在访问越南期间，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团同越南民主共和国政府代表团举行了亲切的会谈。在会谈中，双方谈到了当前国际问题以及有关两国关系的问题，并且对这些问题取得了完全一致的看法。
    公报说，越南民主共和国政府代表团宣布坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，并且相信，他们的斗争将取得最后胜利。
    公报说，越南民主共和国和阿尔及利亚过去都遭受殖民主义的统治，而现在又共同站在反对殖民主义的亚非各国大家庭之中，因此双方具有深刻的互相了解和兄弟般的团结感情。
    公报说，“双方高兴地看到，几年来，反对殖民主义、争取民族解放的运动和保卫世界和平运动越来越发展。在具有历史意义的万隆会议、开罗亚非人民团结大会和非洲国家在阿克拉召开的几次会议以后，亚非各国反对殖民主义、争取和保卫民族独立的运动日益高涨。帝国主义被赶出一些亚非国家以后，他们还正在坚持“实力地位政策”，企图死赖在非洲不走。他们加紧扩军，明目张胆地干涉各国的内政，并且在许多国家阴谋进行颠复活动，他们正在顽固地继续试验核武器，继续制造紧张局势，把人类推向战争边缘。他们正在互相勾结，并且不顾人权和国际法，野蛮地镇压殖民地国家的民族解放运动。他们明目张胆的战争阴谋和野蛮的恐怖行为已经受到了严厉的谴责。具有英勇斗争传统的亚非各国人民在社会主义国家人民和世界爱好和平人民的支持下，将会击败帝国主义的阴谋，并且取得完全的独立。事实已经证明，反对殖民主义的国际团结，尤其是亚非各国同社会主义国家之间的团结，是加速殖民主义灭亡的一个重要因素。”
    公报还说：“双方认为，阿尔及利亚取得独立不仅是阿尔及利亚人民的正当的民族权利，而且对于全世界、尤其是非洲和亚洲具有重要的意义。”
