Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, China's freshwater fish farming industry, like other construction endeavors, has experienced a leap-forward development. This year, the area of freshwater fish farming has increased from 15.8 million mu in 1957 to 35 million mu; the output of freshwater fish will increase from 1.18 million tons in 1957 to more than 4 million tons; and the highest fish production per unit area has also increased from a maximum of 3,765 jin per mu in 1957 to more than 40,000 jin. Many places have created large areas of high-yield production. As fish production has increased, many counties and people's communes have changed the proportion of aquatic products in the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries, leaping from a few percent to tens of percent. The Yueping Production Brigade (formerly Yueping Fishery Agricultural Cooperative) of the Shangyou People's Commune in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, can achieve an annual fish output value of more than 500,000 yuan, accounting for about 70% of its total annual income. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of farmers and fishermen have displayed soaring enthusiasm and launched a large-scale high-yield movement centered on high-density intensive farming, creating a wealth of high-yield experiences in freshwater fish farming. These experiences are worth greatly promoting, and their main contents are:

	I. High-Density Mixed Farming

	High-density stocking is one of the effective measures for high fish production. To fully utilize the water body and meet the requirements of high-density stocking, it must be combined with mixed farming. In this year's high-yield ponds, the number of fish fry stocked per mu ranged from tens of thousands to more than one hundred thousand; the number of fish species stocked was as many as eight or nine, including not only grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, but also common carp, crucian carp, bream, *Megalobrama amblycephala*, and mullet. In order to achieve high-density stocking, multiple fishing and multiple stocking, as well as catching large fish and keeping small fish, or catching large fish and supplementing with small fish, were adopted. Some were stocked seven or eight times a year and fished five or six times.

	Due to the high-density stocking and the expansion of fish farming area, the demand for fish fry has increased unprecedentedly, and solving the fish fry problem has become one of the important keys to achieving high-yield fish farming. Wherever fish fry and fingerlings are produced in large quantities, fish production leaps forward quickly; otherwise, it leaps forward slowly. The principle for breaking through the fish fry barrier should be: raise whatever fry is available; collect whatever fry is available; catch whatever fingerlings are available; collect and catch as much as possible, and hatch as much as possible. Rely on ourselves as much as possible and rely on others as little as possible; rely on manpower as much as possible and rely on nature as little as possible. This year, many provinces and regions have achieved "collecting fry locally, raising fingerlings locally, and stocking locally" in solving the fish fry problem, opening up resources, expanding varieties, and considerably resolving the contradiction between the supply and demand of fish fry, meeting the needs of fish farming.

	Many people's communes and scientific research institutions have carried out creative labor in the artificial hatching of fish and the cultivation of new breeding varieties, and have achieved good results. In June, the South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute of Guangdong Province created a stimulation method combining the external environment and internal spawning induction, which successfully induced silver carp and bighead carp to spawn and hatch in ponds. Subsequently, the Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute of Zhejiang Province and the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences cooperated and also used artificial spawning induction in September to successfully induce silver carp and bighead carp to spawn and hatch in ponds. Some provinces and cities sent people to learn, and Guangdong Province has made universal promotion. In addition, artificial autumn hatching of carp has been carried out in various provinces in the south of the Yangtze River and has been successful, changing the situation that carp can only spawn and hatch in summer. Some have carried out hybridization of carp and crucian carp, and the new varieties produced have accelerated growth but still retain the tender meat and delicious taste of crucian carp. The Tianjin Fish Farm transplanted *Penaeus chinensis*, which grow in seawater, into freshwater and mixed them with common carp and crucian carp. The growth rate is no less than that in seawater. Students from the Aquatic Products Middle School run by the Qinzhou People's Commune in Qin County, Guangdong Province, transplanted marine fish, yellowfin seabream, etc., into freshwater in May. After four months of breeding, each fish gained seven jin of meat, which is faster than any other freshwater fish breeding variety. Some people's communes have also boldly hybridized marine fish and freshwater fish and obtained new varieties. These experimental creations have laid a reliable foundation for solving the problem of fish fry in freshwater fish farming.

	II. Ponds Should Be Deep

	Water depth is the basis of high-density mixed farming. The water body, oxygen, and feed are essential for fish to grow. As the saying goes, "deep water raises big fish" is the reason. If the pond water flows, it is more conducive to the growth of fish. Conversely, if the water is shallow and the stocking density is high, the amount of water occupied by the unit fish body will be small, the fish will grow slowly, and the incidence of disease will be high. Since last winter and this spring, some provinces and regions have combined farmland water conservancy and manure accumulation to transform fish ponds—small ponds into large ponds, shallow ponds into deep ponds, and leaky ponds into water-retaining ponds. There are several benefits to pond transformation: ① After small ponds are changed into large ponds, the small pond ridges that block light and wind are removed, allowing sufficient sunlight, smooth air flow, and a wide wind-receiving area of the pond water, which can often maintain small water waves and increase the oxygen content of the water, which is conducive to high-density stocking; ② Large fish ponds, deep water, and wide fish migration make fish grow faster and have fewer diseases; ③ Large fish ponds and wide areas are easy to manage, saving a quarter of the labor compared to small pond fish farming, reducing production costs.

	Combining farmland water conservancy and manure accumulation to transform fish ponds not only increases the water storage capacity of the ponds, which is conducive to farmland irrigation and expanding fertilizer sources, but also facilitates fish production. In addition to some ponds in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong that are specifically used for fish farming, most ponds are used for both irrigation and fish farming. If there is a drought, the pond water is often drained for irrigation, making it impossible for the farmed fish to continue growing, resulting in losses in fish production and affecting the completion of fish production plans. If the ponds can be deepened in a planned way to increase water storage capacity, it can not only resist drought but also balance rice and fish farming, ensuring the realization of irrigation and fish farming plans.

	III. Feed Well and Feed Enough

	Ensuring that the fish feed is sufficient and fresh so that the fish can eat their fill and eat well is the material foundation for high-yield fish farming. Due to the development of the fish farming industry, it is necessary to further solve the problem of fish feed. According to the experience of various places, it should generally be based on green manure and feed collected from the water.

	At the same time, it is necessary to open up sources of feed from various aspects according to local conditions. Urban sewage and mountain weeds should be actively utilized. According to the habit of "fish eat hundreds of kinds of grass," we should find a variety of green fodder or establish feed bases for cultivating feed. Implementing simple processing of feed, adopting mixed preparation, improving nutrition, and feeding coarse feed with refined feeding are all feasible good methods.

	IV. Dedicated Management

	This year's high-yield fish ponds, lakes, and reservoirs have all fixed dedicated personnel for intensive management. In order to strengthen the responsibility system of production teams, some have also implemented the "three guarantees and five arrivals" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing production, guaranteeing costs, and fish fry arriving at the pond, feed arriving at the pond, technical measures arriving at the pond, output arriving at the pond, and work points arriving at the pond) management system. Fish farming is a delicate and complex production, such as the quality of water and feed, and changes in temperature, all of which are closely related to the growth and survival of fish. Dedicated management facilitates intensive farming, summarizing experience, and technological innovation. Therefore, all people's communes that can raise fish should establish professional fish farming production teams or groups to be responsible for fish farming.

    淡水鱼密放精养丰产经验
    宫明山
    在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的淡水养鱼事业也像其他的建设事业一样有了飞跃的发展。今年的淡水养鱼水面由1957年的一千五百八十万亩增至三千五百万亩；淡水鱼产量将由1957年的一百一十八万吨增至四百余万吨；单位水面的最高产鱼量也由1957年最高亩产三千七百六十五斤，提高到四万多斤。很多地方创造了大面积的高额丰产。由于鱼产量增加，很多县和人民公社改变了水产在农副业总产值中的比重，由原来的百分之几一跃而为百分之几十。湖南省衡阳市上游人民公社岳屏生产大队（原岳屏渔农业社）全年鱼产值可达五十余万元，约占全年总收入的70％。广大的农、渔民在党的领导下，发挥了冲天的干劲，开展了以密放精养为中心的大面积高额丰产运动，创造了淡水养鱼的丰富的高产经验。这些经验值得大大推广，其主要内容是：
    一，密放混养
    密放是养鱼丰产的有效措施之一。为了充分利用水体和达到密放要求必须结合混养。今年的高额丰产塘，每亩放养的鱼种从几万尾到十多万尾；放养鱼类的品种多到八、九种，不仅有青、草、鲢、鳙，而且有鲤、鲫、鳊、鲹、鮻等。为了密放，又采取了多次捕捞，多次放养和捕大留小或捕大补小等办法，有的一年放养七、八次，捕捞五、六次。
    由于密放和养鱼水面的扩大，鱼种的需要量空前加大，解决鱼种问题成为养鱼高额丰产的重要关键之一。凡是鱼苗鱼种搞得多的地方，鱼产量就跃进得快，反之，就跃进得慢。攻破鱼种关的原则应该是：有什么苗，就育什么种；有苗采苗，有种捕种；能采捕就采捕，能孵化就孵化。尽量多靠自己，少靠别人；多靠人工，少靠老天。今年很多省、区在解决鱼种问题上作到了“就地采苗，就地育种，就地放养”，开辟了资源，扩大了品种，相当地解决了鱼种供求紧张的矛盾，满足了养鱼需要。
    对鱼类的人工孵化和新的养殖品种培育，很多人民公社和科学研究机关进行了创造性的劳动，并获得了良好的成绩。广东省华南海水产研究所于6月间创造了外界环境和内在催青相结合的刺激方法，使鲢、鳙在池塘产卵孵化成功。继之，浙江省淡水试验所和中国科学院试验生物研究所等单位合作，采用人工催青的方法，于9月间也使鲢、鳙在池塘产卵孵化成功。有的省、市派人前往学习，广东省已作了普遍的推广。另外，江南各省都进行了鲤鱼的秋季人工孵化，获得成功，改变了鲤鱼只能在夏季产卵孵化的状况。有的进行鲤、鲫鱼杂交，产生的新品种加速了成长，但仍保持鲫鱼的肉嫩、味美的特点。天津市养殖场将海水中生长的对虾移在淡水中同鲤、鲫鱼混养，成长速度不亚于在海水中。广东省钦县钦州人民公社创办的水产中学的学生，于5月间将海水鱼黄鳙等移养于淡水，经四个月的饲养，每尾增肉七斤，较淡水鱼养殖的任何品种成长都快。有的人民公社还大胆地将海水鱼和淡水鱼进行了杂交，获得了新的品种。这些试验创造都给淡水养鱼解决鱼种打下了可靠的基础。
    二，塘水要深
    水深是密放混养的基础。鱼类赖以生长的是水体、氧气和饲料，俗话说“深水养大鱼”就是这个道理。如果塘水流动更有利于鱼类的成长。反之，水浅而放养密，单位鱼体所占的水量就少，鱼就长得慢，发病率也高。自去冬今春以来，有些省、区结合农田水利和积肥，对鱼塘进行了改造——小塘改大塘、浅塘改深塘、漏水塘改保水塘。鱼塘改造后有几大好处：①小塘改为大塘后，除掉了遮光挡风的小塘埂，使阳光照射充足，空气流畅，塘水的受风面积广，能经常保持微小水波，增加水的含氧量，有利于密放；②鱼塘面积大、水深，鱼类洄游宽畅，成长快，鱼病少；③鱼塘大、面积宽，管理容易，较小塘养鱼节省四分之一的人工，降低了生产成本。
    结合农田水利和积肥改造鱼塘，既增加池塘的蓄水量有利于农田灌溉和增辟肥源，又有利于养鱼增产。我国除江苏、浙江和广东等省有一些专用于养鱼的池塘外，多数池塘是既用于灌溉，又用于养鱼，如遇天旱则往往车干塘水灌田，致使所养的鱼类无法继续生长，造成养鱼生产的亏本和影响养鱼生产计划的完成。如能将池塘有计划地挖深增加蓄水量，既抗旱亦能稻鱼兼顾，保证了灌溉和养鱼计划的实现。
    三，喂饱喂足
    保证鱼类的饲料充足、新鲜，使鱼类能够吃饱、吃好，是养鱼丰产的物质基础。由于养鱼事业的发展，需要进一步解决鱼饲料问题。根据各地的经验，一般应以绿肥和水中采集饲料为主。
    同时又必须根据因地制宜，多方面开辟饲料的来源。城镇的污水，山区的杂草等，都应积极的利用。根据“鱼吃百种草”的习性，应该寻找多种多样的青饲料或建立饲料基地栽培饲料。对饲料实行简易加工，采用混合配制，提高营养，粗饲精喂等，这些都是可行的好办法。
    四，专人管理
    今年高额丰产的鱼塘、湖泊、水库，都固定了专人管理精养。为了加强生产队的责任制，有的还实行了“三包五到”（包工、包产、包成本和鱼种到塘、饲料到塘、技术措施到塘、产量到塘、工分到塘）的管理制度。鱼类的养殖是一种精细复杂的生产，如水质和饲料的好坏，气温的变化等，对鱼类的生长和成活都有密切关系。专人管理就便于进行精养、总结经验和革新技术。所以，凡是可以养鱼的人民公社，都应该建立专业的养鱼生产队或组，专责进行养鱼。
