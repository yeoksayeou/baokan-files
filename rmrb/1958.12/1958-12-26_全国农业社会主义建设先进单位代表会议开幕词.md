Comrades, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed that in 1959 we should continue to increase grain production, so that the total grain output will reach about 1,050 billion catties, and strive to ensure that the average grain possession per capita in areas with general conditions is 2,000 catties or more for both urban and rural populations; we must continue to develop cotton production, so that the total cotton output will reach about 100 million dan (ginned cotton); we must vigorously increase the production of oil crops, sugar crops, beans, hemp and other various cash crops for exchange, vigorously carry out afforestation campaigns, greatly increase forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and other various sideline productions, and greatly develop community-run industries. This is the combat task of the agricultural front in the coming new year.
Comrade representatives:
The National Representative Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction is now open. Our conference is a celebration meeting, a commendation meeting, and also a mobilization meeting.
More than 5,000 representatives from all regions and ethnic groups of the country are attending this conference. The comrades attending the conference are all pioneers in the great leap forward in agricultural production, and backbones in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction in rural areas. The comrades attending the conference and the advanced units they represent have all made outstanding achievements in establishing people's communes, developing agricultural production, building water conservancy projects, conserving water and soil, reforming tools, developing meteorological work, developing agricultural science and technology, developing forestry, developing animal husbandry, developing aquaculture, developing community-run industries, developing rural culture and education, developing rural transportation and postal and telecommunications services, and developing rural supply and marketing businesses. The pioneering role and achievements of the comrades attending the conference and the advanced units they represent have been valued by the Party and respected by the people.
1958 was a year of comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production in our country, and a year of great achievements on the agricultural front. The total grain output this year was about 750 billion catties, and the total cotton output was about 67 million dan (ginned cotton), both more than double that of 1957. The output of oil crops and other cash crops, large and small livestock, timber, aquatic products, etc., also increased significantly. The afforestation area was more than 400 million mu. Most parts of the country have achieved the per-mu yield targets for grain and cotton stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" to be achieved in 1967 ahead of schedule. The total area of grain crops (excluding sweet potatoes) with a per-mu yield of more than 1,000 catties reached more than 160 million mu, equivalent to 10% of the grain crop planting area (excluding sweet potatoes), which is more than 100 times more than the 1,000-catty mu in 1957. There have also emerged several provinces with 1,000-catty rice, hundreds of counties with 1,000-catty and double-1,000-catty rice, corn, and millet, and 100-catty, 200-catty, and even 300-catty ginned cotton counties. At the same time, a number of high-yield "satellites" have appeared for various agricultural and forestry crops such as wheat, rice, corn, millet, sorghum, cotton, peanuts, rapeseed, jute, tea, and tea oil, creating unprecedented high-yield records. Many areas with relatively extensive farming and very low grain yields in the past have also turned over this year. Yulin and Yan'an in northern Shaanxi, Yanbei and Jin Northwest in Shanxi, Bashang in Hebei, Heze in Shandong, Xiangyang in Hubei, Xiangxi in Hunan, and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong used to have an average grain yield of only dozens or hundreds of catties per mu, which was the bottom of the province or the country's grain production; this year, grain production in these areas has increased several times, ten times, or even dozens of times, and the bottom has turned into a peak. Many original high-yield grain areas have also doubled their output this year. The facts of the past year have powerfully refuted the pessimistic view that agricultural production can only grow at a rate of a few percent per year, and have also completely shattered the reactionary bourgeois Malthusian population theory and the fallacy of "the law of diminishing returns to land." The facts of the past year have once again eloquently proved that the socialist system has incomparable superiority over the capitalist system.
Several hundred activists in the patriotic health campaign from all over the country are also attending this conference. The movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate diseases has also achieved extremely brilliant achievements in 1958. A large number of flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows have been eliminated, and other pests, harmful animals, and harmful birds have also been greatly reduced, and the degree of harm has been significantly reduced. Eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene has indeed played the role of "changing customs and transforming the country." In rural areas, the environmental sanitation of laboring people's homes has been significantly improved, personal hygiene has also been significantly improved, and maternal and child health care work has also made great progress, which has created a good foundation for eliminating diseases. Smallpox, plague, and kala-azar have been basically eliminated, and the incidence of several common acute infectious diseases has been greatly reduced; in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, 60% of the counties (cities) have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Some occupational diseases in factories and mines also have effective prevention and control measures. The movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate diseases has also changed people's ideological awareness and mental outlook, and has also promoted medical and health personnel to break superstitions and liberate their minds. There have also been many new creations with remarkable results in medical technology. The movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate diseases has protected the labor force, improved labor attendance and labor efficiency, increased fertilizer sources, greatly supported agricultural production, and reduced grain losses.
On the basis of the comprehensive great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the high tide of the people's commune movement appeared in the rural areas of the country in the autumn and summer of 1958. By November, the original 700,000 agricultural cooperatives had been reorganized into more than 26,000 people's communes. Many individual farmers who had not joined agricultural cooperatives in the past also joined the people's communes under the promotion of this high tide. Now more than 500 million farmers have participated in the people's communes. Except for Tibet and certain individual regions, rural areas of all ethnic groups have realized communization.
People's communes are the inevitable product of China's economic and political development, the inevitable product of the Party's socialist rectification movement and the general line for socialist construction, and the inevitable product of China's great leap forward in industry and agriculture. As the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: people's communes will accelerate the speed of China's socialist construction, will become the best form for China's rural areas to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and will become the best form for China to transition from socialist society to communist society. People's communes have fully demonstrated their great superiority in the nationwide steelmaking campaign and the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing campaigns this autumn, and will further exert their superiority in the future, promoting a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. According to their personal experience, the broad masses of peasants deeply feel that larger agricultural cooperatives are stronger than smaller ones, and people's communes are even stronger. "Small cooperatives produce small increases in production, large cooperatives produce large increases in production, and communes produce comprehensive increases in production"; "small cooperatives make small turnarounds, large cooperatives make large turnarounds, and communes make complete turnarounds." This is exactly the peasants' experience.
The high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, the rapid realization of people's communes in rural areas, and the comprehensive leap forward in various tasks in the past year are the brilliant achievements of the hardworking and selfless labor of the broad masses of working people, and the great victory of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results"!
On the basis of the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958, under the new situation in which people's communes have been realized in rural areas, the various conditions are more favorable, our strength is more abundant, and our experience is also richer. We must and are fully capable of striving for a better and comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed that in 1959 we should continue to increase grain production, so that the total grain output will reach about 1,050 billion catties, and strive to ensure that the average grain possession per capita in areas with general conditions is 2,000 catties or more for both urban and rural populations; we must continue to develop cotton production, so that the total cotton output will reach about 100 million dan (ginned cotton); we must vigorously increase the production of oil crops, sugar crops, beans, hemp and other various cash crops for exchange, vigorously carry out afforestation campaigns, greatly increase forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and other various sideline productions, and greatly develop community-run industries. This is the combat task of the agricultural front in the coming new year. Completing these tasks is of great significance for accelerating socialist industrial construction, improving people's lives, expanding socialist accumulation, facilitating the capital turnover of people's communes, and consolidating and developing people's communes. We must continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, painstaking work, and skillful work, and fulfill the above tasks and indicators with full confidence and strive to exceed them.
Doing a good job in the current field management of winter wheat and rapeseed and all preparations for spring plowing and spring sowing is of great significance for striving for a greater harvest in 1959, because to strive for a greater harvest in 1959, we must strive for a great harvest of summer-harvested crops and early rice in 1959, and we must win the first battle. In this regard, we must grasp it tightly and must not relax in the slightest.
In order to achieve a greater harvest in 1959, we must earnestly sum up the experience of this year's bumper harvest; we must conscientiously implement the "eight-character charter" of agricultural production: "water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, tools, and management." At the same time, in agricultural production in 1959, we should actively carry out the movement of large-area high-yield fields, change the past "shallow plowing and rough cultivation, extensive planting and low yield" to "deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, less planting and more yield," so as to achieve the "three-three system" of cultivated land planting instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in a planned and gradual manner within a certain period of time; we should seize tool reform, actively manufacture and promote electric plows, make full use of hydropower, wind power, electricity and biogas and other power resources, and greatly improve labor productivity, so that we can draw more labor to engage in socialist construction undertakings such as industrial production and rural transportation, culture, education and health.
In 1959, we must further develop rural sideline occupations and make good arrangements for the production of non-staple foods such as chickens, ducks, fish, meat, and vegetables to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people. Ensuring the supply of non-staple foods to urban and industrial and mining areas is one of the important tasks of the agricultural departments, commercial departments, and rural people's communes. Every advanced unit in agricultural socialist construction should play a leading role in this regard.
In order to achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, it is necessary to fully follow the mass line, care about the lives of the masses, and do a good job in ideological work. To this end, every people's commune must not only do a good job in production, but also do a good job in life. We must earnestly run collective life and welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly well; we must ensure that the working people have the necessary time to rest and sleep. Only by eating well, sleeping well, and taking good care of children can the masses be happy, energetic, and ideologically advanced, and can their enthusiasm be greater and production can be leap forward. Strengthening health work should also be an important part of doing a good job in life. With the collectivization of life, special attention should be paid to the hygiene of nurseries and public canteens. We must also vigorously carry out the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, which is also a side support for production. In short, doing a good job in production, doing a good job in life, and doing a good job in ideological work are three indispensable aspects of the operation and management of people's communes, and they are also the main contents of consolidating people's communes from now until before spring plowing. Every advanced unit in agricultural socialist construction should not only be advanced in production, but also advanced in organizing and arranging the lives of the masses and in political and ideological work.
Comrade representatives! Although our work has achieved great results, we must never become arrogant because of our achievements. "Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind." We should always remember this truth taught by Chairman Mao. Always be humble and prudent, strive to overcome exaggeration, and do our work more, better, more carefully, and more practically. We should strive to learn and become both red and expert, and constantly achieve new progress and new achievements. We should continue to liberate our minds, carry forward the communist spirit of cooperation, consolidate and strengthen our close ties with the masses, and, under the leadership of the Party, lead the broad masses of peasant brothers to carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution, consolidate the people's communes, and build a modern socialist new countryside. All advanced units and advanced figures in agricultural socialist construction should learn from each other, cooperate with each other, carry out socialist friendship competitions, and strive together to realize a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

    全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议开幕词
    中共中央农村工作部部长国务院副总理  邓子恢
    党的八届六中全会提出，1959年我们要继续增产粮食，使粮食的总产量达到一万零五百亿斤左右，力求做到一般具有条件的地区按城乡人口平均每人有粮食两千斤，或者更多一些；要继续发展棉花生产，使棉花的总产量达到一亿担（皮棉）左右；要大力增加可供交换的油料、糖料、豆类、麻类和其他各种经济作物的生产，要大力开展造林运动、大大增加林业、畜牧业、渔业和其它各种副业生产，要大大发展社办工业。这是农业战线在即将开始的新的一年中的战斗任务。各位代表、各位同志：
    全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议，现在开幕了。我们这个大会，是个祝捷大会，庆功大会，也是个誓师大会。
    出席这次大会的，有来自全国各地区各民族的五千几百位代表。出席大会的同志都是农业生产大跃进中的先锋，都是在农村中贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的骨干。出席大会的同志和所代表的先进单位，都曾经分别在建立人民公社，发展农业生产方面，在兴修水利，保持水土，改革工具，发展气象工作，发展农业科学技术方面，在发展林业，发展畜牧业，发展水产业方面，在发展社办工业方面，在发展农村文化教育，以及发展农村交通邮电事业和发展农村供销业务等等方面，做出了优秀的成绩。出席大会的同志和所代表的先进单位在工作中所起的先锋作用和取得的成就，已经受到了党的重视，受到了人民的尊敬。
    1958年，是我国农业生产全面大丰收的一年，是我国农业战线上获得伟大成就的一年。这一年的粮食总产量为七千五百亿斤左右，棉花总产量为六千七百万担（皮棉）左右，都比1957年增产一倍以上，油料和其它经济作物、大小牲畜、木材、水产等等，也都有显著的增产。造林面积四亿多亩。全国绝大部分地区已经提前实现了“全国农业发展纲要”规定要在1967年达到的粮、棉亩产指标。全国粮食作物（不包括薯类）亩产千斤以上的面积共达一亿六千多万亩，相当于粮食作物播种面积（也不包括薯类）的10％，比1957年的千斤亩增加了一百多倍。还出现了好几个水稻千斤省，好几百个水稻、玉米、谷子的千斤县、双千斤县和百斤皮棉县、两百斤皮棉县、以至三百斤皮棉县。同时，小麦、水稻、玉米、谷子、高粱、棉花、花生、油菜、黄麻、茶叶、茶油等等各种农林作物都出现了一批丰产“卫星”，创造了破天荒的高额丰产纪录。许多历来耕作比较粗放、粮食产量很低的地区，今年也翻了身。陕北的榆林和延安，山西的雁北和晋西北，河北的坝上，山东的菏泽，湖北的襄阳，湖南的湘西，广东的雷州半岛等地区，过去粮食每亩平均产量都不过几十斤或者百多斤，是省内或者全国粮食产量的锅底；今年这些地区的粮食几倍、十几倍甚至几十倍地增产，锅底翻成了高峰。许多原来的粮食高产区，今年的产量也加了番。一年来的事实，有力地驳倒了农业生产每年只能以百分之几的速度增长的悲观论调，也彻底地粉碎了反动的资产阶级的马尔萨斯人口论和“土地报酬递减律”之类的谬论。一年来的事实，又一次雄辩地证明社会主义制度比资本主义制度有着无比的优越性。
    出席这次大会的还有几百位来自全国各地的爱国卫生运动的积极分子。除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的运动，在1958年也取得了极其辉煌的成就。消灭了大量的苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠和麻雀，其他害虫、害兽、害鸟也大为减少，危害程度已显著减轻。除四害、讲卫生，确实起了“移风易俗，改造国家”的作用，在农村中，劳动人民住宅的环境卫生有了显著的改善，个人卫生也有了显著的提高，妇婴保健工作也有了极大的进步，这就为消灭疾病创造了良好的基础。天花、鼠疫、黑热病已基本消灭，常见的几种急性传染病的发病率已大为降低；在血吸虫病流行地区，已有60％的县（市），基本消灭了血吸虫病。工矿中的一些职业病，也有了有效的防治措施。除四害、讲卫生的运动，还改变了人们的思想意识和精神面貌，也促进了医药卫生人员破除迷信，解放思想，在医药技术方面有了不少成效卓著的新创造。除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动，保护了劳动力，提高了劳动出勤率和劳动效率，并增加了肥源，大大支援了农业生产，减少了粮食损耗。
    在工农业生产全面大跃进的基础上，1958年的夏秋之交，在全国农村中出现了人民公社化运动的高潮。到11月间，原来的七十多万个农业合作社改组成了两万六千多个人民公社。许多在过去没有加入农业合作社的单干农民，也在这个高潮的推动下，加入了人民公社。现在已有五亿多农民参加了人民公社，除西藏和某些个别地区以外，各民族的农村都已经实现了公社化。
    人民公社是我国经济和政治发展的必然产物，是党的社会主义全民整风运动和社会主义建设总路线的必然产物，是我国工农业大跃进的必然产物，正如党的八届六中全会所指出的：人民公社将加快我国社会主义建设的速度，将成为我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的最好形式，将成为我国由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好形式。人民公社已经在今年秋季全民大炼钢铁和秋收、秋耕、秋种运动中，充分显示了它的巨大的优越性，今后必将进一步发挥它的优越性，推动工农业生产更大地跃进。广大农民群众根据亲身的体验，深深地感到农业合作社大的比小的强，人民公社更强。“小社小增产，大社大增产，公社全面增产”；“小社小翻身，大社大翻身，公社彻底翻身”，这正是农民的经验之谈。
    一年来工农业生产这样高速度的发展，农村人民公社化这样迅速地实现，以及各项工作的全面跃进，是广大劳动人民干劲冲天、忘我劳动的辉煌成果，是党中央和毛主席的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”这条总路线的伟大胜利！
    在1958年农业大跃进的基础上，在农村已经实现人民公社化的新形势下，各种条件是更加有利了，我们的力量更加雄厚，经验也更加丰富了，我们必须而且完全有可能争取1959年农业生产更好地和全面地跃进。党的八届六中全会提出，1959年我们要继续增产粮食，使粮食的总产量达到一万零五百亿斤左右，力求做到一般具有条件的地区按城乡人口平均每人有粮食两千斤，或者更多一些；要继续发展棉花生产，使棉花的总产量达到一亿担（皮棉）左右；要大力增加可供交换的油料、糖料、豆类、麻类和其他各种经济作物的生产，要大力开展造林运动、大大增加林业、畜牧业、渔业和其它各种副业生产，要大大发展社办工业。这是农业战线在即将开始的新的一年中的战斗任务，完成这些任务对于加速社会主义工业建设，提高人民生活、扩大社会主义积累、便利人民公社的资金周转、巩固和发展人民公社，都有着重大的意义。我们必须继续发扬实干、苦干、巧干的精神，满怀信心地胜利地完成上述的任务和指标、并且力争超过。
    搞好当前的冬麦和油菜的田间管理和春耕春播的一切准备工作，对争取1959年更大的丰收具有重大的意义，因为要争取1959年更大的丰收，就要争取1959年夏收作物和早稻的大丰收，就要打好第一个战役。在这方面，我们必须抓紧，丝毫不能有所放松。
    为了取得1959年更大的丰收，必须认真总结今年的丰产经验；必须切实执行农业生产的“水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管”八字宪法。同时在1959年的农业生产上，应该积极地开展大面积高额丰产田运动，改变过去的“浅耕粗作、广种薄收”为“深耕细作，少种多收”，以便在一定的时间内，有计划地逐步实现党中央和毛主席所指示的耕地种植
  “三三制”；应该抓紧工具改革，积极制造推广电犁、充分利用水力、风力、电力和沼气等等动力资源，大大提高劳动生产率。以便使我们有可能抽出更多的劳力去从事工业生产和农村交通运输、文化教育卫生等方面的社会主义建设事业。
    在1959年，必须进一步发展农村副业，很好地安排鸡鸭鱼肉蔬菜等副食品的生产，以满足城乡人民不断增长的需要。保证城市和工矿区人民的副食品供应，是农业部门、商业部门和农村人民公社的重要任务之一。每一个农业社会主义建设的先进单位，都应该在这一方面起带头作用。
    为了取得1959年农业生产更大的跃进，必需充分走群众路线，必需关心群众生活，并做好思想工作，为此每个人民公社都必须既要搞好生产，又要搞好生活。必须认真办好公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体生活福利事业；必须保证劳动人民有必要的休息和睡觉的时间。只有吃好饭、睡好觉、带好孩子，群众的心情舒畅，精力充沛，思想进步，干劲才能更大，生产才可能更大跃进。加强卫生工作，也应该是搞好生活的一项重要内容。生活集体化，托儿所和公共食堂的卫生工作更要特别注意。还要大搞以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，这也是支援生产的一个侧面。总之搞好生产搞好生活搞好思想工作是人民公社经营管理工作不可缺一的三个方面，也是从现在起到春耕前整顿巩固人民公社的主要内容。每一个农业社会主义建设的先进单位，不仅应该在生产上是先进的，而且在组织和安排群众生活上在政治思想工作上也应该是先进的。
    各位代表！我们的工作虽然有很大成绩，但是绝不能因为有了成绩而骄傲起来。“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，我们应当永远记住毛主席教导我们的这个真理。永远谦虚谨慎，力戒浮夸，勤勤恳恳地把工作做得更多，更好，更细致，更踏实。应当努力学习、做到又红又专，不断取得新的进步和新的成就。应当继续解放思想，发扬共产主义的协作精神，巩固和加强同群众的密切联系，在党的领导下，带动广大农民弟兄进行技术革命和文化革命，巩固人民公社，建设现代化的社会主义的新农村。所有的农业社会主义建设的先进单位和先进人物，都应当相互学习，相互协作，开展社会主义的友谊竞赛，共同为实现1959年农业生产更大的丰收和全面的跃进而奋斗。
