Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th -- Sichuan Province's mass-based commercial transportation surge campaign has achieved great results. Statistics up to the 15th show that over 276,000 tons of commercial materials, including agricultural and sideline products, have been transported to major cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu, as well as to other provinces. This includes a large quantity of pork and tangerines. More than 100,000 tons of materials have also been concentrated in major ports and stations, awaiting shipment to other areas. At the same time, large quantities of daily necessities are being continuously transported to the vast rural areas.

Sichuan Province, with its vast territory and inconvenient transportation, has a large amount of agricultural and sideline products scattered in the mountainous areas. Therefore, short-distance transportation is a key issue in winning the commercial transportation surge battle. At present, all localities are fully mobilizing the masses to make full use of all transportation tools to engage in large-scale short-distance transportation, concentrating materials to transportation arteries as quickly as possible, and mobilizing four forces (cart teams, wooden sailing boat teams, porter teams, and manual transportation teams) to form shock brigades to participate in the commercial transportation surge battle. In the mountainous Wanxian Special District, more than two million people have been organized to rush to transport commercial materials, and many temporary material distribution centers have been established in the mountainous areas. In the past week, 52,000 tons of materials have been transported, equivalent to the total transport volume in the first half of this year. Yilong County, far from the railway, organized a transportation general corps combining workers, peasants, commerce, students, and soldiers. The county party secretary serves as the commander of the general corps. Each production team of each people's commune assigns ten people to form a short-distance shock transportation team according to the principle of "come when busy, leave when idle," carrying out segmented transportation, receiving from the top and sending to the bottom. Recently, the county has transported more than 300,000 jin of cotton and non-staple foods, and at the same time transported back more than 200,000 jin of daily necessities such as salt and cloth. Mass-based short-distance shock transportation ensures that long-distance transportation tools such as trains, ships, and automobiles arrive and depart at any time, and the goods flow smoothly.

    四川调动四支运输力量
    新华社成都20日电  四川省群众性的商业运输突击运动成绩很大。到15日的统计，运到重庆、成都等主要城市和省外的农副产品等商业物资已达二十七万六千多吨，其中有大量猪肉和桔柑。还有十多万吨物资已经集中到各大港口、车站，等待外运。与此同时，大批生活日用品也陆续运到广大农村。
    地区辽阔、交通不便的四川省，大量的农副产品都分散在山区，因此要打好商业运输突击战，短途运输是个关键问题。目前，各地都充分发动群众，利用一切运输工具大搞短途运输，尽快地把物资集中到交通干线，并调集四方面的力量（车子化队伍、木帆船队伍、搬运队伍、人力运输队伍）组成突击队，投入商业运输突击战。山岭重叠的万县专区组织了二百多万人突击抢运商业物资，在山区设立许多临时的物资集散点，最近一星期内就运出了五万二千吨物资，相当于今年上半年的总运量。远离铁路的仪陇县组织了工农商学兵相结合的运输总团，县委书记任总团长，每一个人民公社的每个生产小队都抽出十人，根据“忙则来、闲则去”的原则，组成短途突击运输队，分段接运，上接下送。最近，这个县已运出棉花和副食品等物资三十多万斤，同时运回了食盐、布匹等生活用品二十多万斤。群众性的短途突击运输，保证了火车、轮船、汽车等长途运输工具随到随运，货畅其流。
