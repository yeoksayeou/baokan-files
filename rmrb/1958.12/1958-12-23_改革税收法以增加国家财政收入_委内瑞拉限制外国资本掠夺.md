Reform Tax Laws to Increase National Revenue
Venezuela Restricts Foreign Capital Plunder
American Oil Capitalists Fly into a Rage, Publicly Resort to Intimidation

    This dispatch: In Latin America, which is regarded by the United States as its "backyard," another incident recently occurred that has sent American monopoly groups into a rage: the Venezuelan military junta has approved a reformed tax law aimed at increasing national revenue. This decision was announced in an official gazette published on the 20th. The new tax law stipulates that foreign companies with investments exceeding $28 million must pay a tax of 45%.

    This decision made by the Venezuelan military junta is of great significance for improving the country's economic situation.

    Venezuela is a country with very rich oil resources and is currently the world's largest oil exporter. In 1957, it produced 145 million metric tons of crude oil, which is 88 million metric tons more than Kuwait, the largest oil producer in the Middle East. However, the country's economic situation has consistently been poor. This is because foreign oil companies in Venezuela enjoy the privilege of equal profit sharing. Under this unreasonable system, foreign oil monopoly groups have made huge fortunes, while Venezuela has consistently been in a state of financial deficit.

    The situation will be different after the new tax law is implemented. With the 45% tax levied on huge foreign companies, plus other taxes such as property tax and social insurance tax, some huge foreign monopoly oil companies will have to pay 65% to 70% in taxes. In this way, compared with the past, the plunder by foreign oil companies will be somewhat restricted, and Venezuela's economic situation will be considerably improved. Undoubtedly, this is good news for the Venezuelan people.

    However, for the Wall Street tycoons, the reform of Venezuela's tax law is a bolt from the blue, because the United States is the largest investor in Venezuela. According to materials from the December 19th issue of "U.S. News & World Report," U.S. private investment in Venezuela amounts to $3.5 billion, of which investment in oil accounts for $3 billion.

    Precisely because of this, after the decision to reform the tax law was announced, American oil companies, which have always done as they pleased in Venezuela, immediately reacted strongly.

    According to reports, Creole Petroleum Corporation, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, the largest oil company in Venezuela, issued a statement on the 20th expressing "surprise" and "unease" at the above decision. The statement from the oil company said: "In Venezuela, the usual practice has always been to conduct extensive research before taking any measures that might affect important industrial sectors in the national economy—such as oil," but this time Venezuela did not allow American companies to present "their opinions" when announcing this decree. The statement threatened that the measure taken by the Venezuelan government would have "adverse" economic consequences for Venezuelan oil.

    Spokesmen for Standard Oil of New York and Texaco also made similar statements at the same time. The Texaco spokesman even unreasonably blamed the Venezuelan government for taking this action "without prior consultation." All American company spokesmen emphasized the need to immediately study the "impact" and "consequences" of this measure carefully.

    The Wall Street tycoons arrogantly believe that their intimidation tactics against Venezuela seem capable of making the Venezuelan military junta change this decision. However, the facts before this decision was officially announced show that American suppression and threats against Venezuela are not as effective as they used to be.

    Not long ago, the newly elected president of Venezuela, Rómulo Betancourt, announced that Venezuela would no longer grant more concessions to foreign oil companies and would revise the regulations that granted privileges to foreign companies in the past. After this, the United States immediately put pressure on Venezuela. American newspapers clamored that American oil industry figures had decided that if Venezuela's demands were too high, it might face the threat of transferring a large part of oil production elsewhere.

    The "U.S. News & World Report" weekly, which is close to the U.S. government, even wrote with ulterior motives that it is still "possible that someone will try to steal Betancourt's…presidency by rebellion."

    Not only that, but Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thomas Mann also made a special trip to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, on the 18th to hold talks with President Betancourt on Venezuela's future oil policy, attempting to prevent Venezuela from revising its oil policy. It is said that during the talks, Thomas Mann also wanted Betancourt to accept American restrictions on Venezuelan oil exports, because otherwise, it "would make the American market depressed."

    Obviously, all of America's efforts were in vain, and the decision to reform Venezuela's tax law was still announced. And Thomas Mann had no choice but to return home in disgrace on the 21st.

    Let those American oil magnates continue to rage! The future of their plunder business is getting worse and worse anyway. Whether in the Middle East or in their "backyard," this trend has become increasingly obvious. (Attached picture)

### 改革税收法以增加国家财政收入  委内瑞拉限制外国资本掠夺

    改革税收法以增加国家财政收入
    委内瑞拉限制外国资本掠夺
    美国石油资本家暴跳如雷公然大肆恫吓
    本报讯  在被美国视为“后院”的拉丁美洲，最近又发生了一件使得美国垄断集团暴跳如雷的事件：委内瑞拉军政府委员会已经批准了一项目的在于增加国家财政收入的改革税收法。这个决定，是在20日发布的一项官方公报宣布的。新的税收法规定，凡是超过二千八百万美元投资的外国公司必须纳税45％。
    委内瑞拉军政府委员会所作的这个决定，对于改善国家经济情况有重大的意义。
    委内瑞拉是石油资源十分丰富的国家，而且是目前世界上出口石油最多的国家。在1957年出产了一亿四千五百万公吨原油，比中东出产石油最多的科威特还多八千八百万公吨。但是，这个国家的经济状况却一直不好。这是因为，在委内瑞拉的外国石油公司享受着对分利润的特权。在这种不合理的制度下，外国石油垄断集团固然大发横财，而委内瑞拉就一直陷于入不敷出的境地。
    新的税收法实施以后，情况就不同了。对巨大外国公司所征的45％的税款，再加上其他税款如财产税和社会保险税，一些巨大的外国垄断石油公司将必须缴纳65％到70％的税。这样，比起过去来，外国石油公司的掠夺就受到了一些限制，委内瑞拉的经济状况就会得到相当的改善。无疑，对于委内瑞拉人民来说，这是一个好消息。
    但是，对华尔街的大亨们来说，委内瑞拉改革税收法却是当头一棒，因为，美国在委内瑞拉是最大的投资者。据19日“美国新闻与世界报道”的材料，美国在委内瑞拉的私人投资达三十五亿美元，其中对石油的投资占三十亿美元。
    正因为这样，改革税收法的决定传出以后，一向在委内瑞拉为所欲为的美国石油公司马上有了强烈的反应。
    据报道，在委内瑞拉最大的一家石油公司——美国新泽西美孚油公司所属的克里奥尔石油公司，20日发表声明表示对上述决定感到“惊奇”和“不安”。这家石油公司的声明说：“在委内瑞拉，过去每采取一项可能影响国家经济中的重要工业部门——如石油——的措施时，向来的惯例是先要进行广泛研究的”，而这一次委内瑞拉在宣布这一项法令时，却没有让美国公司陈述”它们的意见。声明威胁说，委内瑞拉政府所采取的这一措施对委内瑞拉石油的经济后果“将是不利的”。
    美国纽约美孚油公司以及德士古石油公司的发言人也在同时发表了类似的谈话。德士古石油公司的发言人竟然无理责怪委内拉瑞政府
  “事先未经商量”，就采取这一行动。所有美国公司的发言人都强调要马上仔细研究这一措施的“影响”和“后果”。
    华尔街的大亨们狂妄地认为，他们对委内瑞拉的恫吓手段，似乎能够使委内瑞拉军政府委员会改变这个决定。但是，在这个决定正式宣布以前的事实说明，美国对委内瑞拉的压制和威胁已经不像过去那末容易奏效了。
    不久以前，在这次委内瑞拉选举中当选的新总统贝坦科尔特宣布，委内瑞拉将不再给外国石油企业更多的租让权，并且将修改过去给予外国公司特权的规定。在这以后，美国就立刻对委内瑞拉施加压力。美国的报刊扬言，美国石油界人士已经决定，如果委内瑞拉所提的要求过高，那就可能受到把很大部分石油生产转移别处去的威胁。
    接近美国官方的“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊甚至别有用心地写道，仍然“可能有人设法以叛乱来窃取贝坦科尔特……的总统职位”。
    不但如此，美国经济事务助理国务卿托马斯·曼18日还特地赶到委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯去，同贝坦科尔特总统就委内瑞拉将来的石油政策问题举行了会谈，企图阻止委内瑞拉修改石油政策。据说在会谈中托马斯·曼还要贝坦科尔特接受美国对委内瑞拉石油出口的限制，因为否则“就会使美国市场变得萧条”。
    显然，美国的一切努力都是徒劳无功，委内瑞拉改革税收法的决定还是宣布了。而托马斯·曼在21日只好灰溜溜地回国去。
    让美国那些石油大王们去继续暴跳如雷吧！他们的掠夺事业前途反正是越来越不好了。不论在中东还是在“后院”，这个趋势已经发展得越来越明显了。（附图片）
