Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 19th: The Ministry of Railways held an on-site experience exchange meeting in Zhengzhou City from December 8th to 15th, focusing on the Guan Ting and Xiao Ba models.

The leading cadres in charge of transportation from various provinces, cities, some special districts, counties, townships, and communes, as well as representatives from twenty-seven railway bureaus across the country, attended the meeting. They listened to representatives from Guantings Township and Guantings Station in Changge County, Henan Province, and Xiejis Township and Xiaoba Station in Shangqiu County, about their experiences in running transportation by the whole Party and all the people, combining industry, agriculture, and military affairs. They also visited the local transportation operations in Guantings, Xiaoba, and Luohe, and exchanged experiences from various regions. The representatives unanimously agreed that the experience of the masses in Guantings, Xiaoba, and other places in running transportation not only found a solution to the problem of station congestion but also opened up a broad path for the masses to run transportation in the future. Stations in these areas had experienced congestion during the great leap forward in industry and agriculture this year. However, under the leadership of the local Party committees, the people of these areas broke the mysterious view of running railway transportation, criticized the one-sided ideas that railway transportation has nothing to do with me and that running transportation hinders production, and quickly organized loading and unloading teams. The Guantings and Xiaoba People's Communes established a transportation army near the stations that combined industry, agriculture, and military affairs. When there were trains, they loaded and unloaded; when there were goods, they moved them; when there were no trains or goods, they farmed, ran factories, studied, and trained. Luohe City also organized railway transportation backbone teams, standing teams, and reserve teams, and implemented a four-in-one approach of railway, highway, shipping, and handling. The meeting called on all regions to earnestly study the experiences of these regions.

The meeting pointed out that since the beginning of this year, driven by the comprehensive great leap forward in industry and agriculture, a great leap forward has also emerged in national railway transportation. In the past, railway transportation could only load more than 20,000 cars per day, but now it has increased to more than 30,000 cars per day, and the turnaround time of vehicles has also been greatly shortened compared to the past. However, this is still far from meeting the needs of the development of the situation. To truly enable the railway to play a huge role as a "pioneer," we must resolutely learn to walk on two legs. On the one hand, the railway department must vigorously develop "large foreign groups," making every effort to accelerate the construction of railway double tracks and the manufacture of locomotives and vehicles, so that they can be put into transportation as soon as possible. On the other hand, we must also take the road of "small local groups" and mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in the transportation movement.

After summarizing the experiences of Guantings, Xiaoba, and other places, the meeting believed that the main advantages of mobilizing the masses to run transportation are: first, it guarantees railway transportation, meets the needs of the communes for railways, and promotes the development of industry and agriculture in the communes; second, it cultivates loading and unloading technical talents, brings into play the efficiency of railway transportation equipment, and accelerates the turnover of vehicles; third, the establishment of a transportation army that combines industry, agriculture, and military affairs can comprehensively use labor and adapt to the characteristics of unbalanced transportation volume at intermediate stations; fourth, it provides a broad mass base for technological reforms in railway transportation and loading and unloading work.

The meeting believed that at present, to mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in transportation, we should advocate the practice of learning while doing and improving while learning, calling on the masses to run it in a big way and quickly, and then gradually consolidate and improve it on the basis of popularization. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, adapt to local conditions, carry out technological revolutions, adjust labor organization, and improve operating methods to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    铁路运输迈开双腿快跃进
    铁道部推广人民公社建立运输大军的经验
    新华社郑州19日电  铁道部8日到15日在郑州市召开了官亭、小坝经验交流现场会议。
    参加会议的各省、市和一部分专区、县、乡、公社负责交通运输工作的领导干部和全国二十七个铁路局的代表们，听取了河南省长葛县官亭乡、官亭车站和商丘县谢集乡、小坝车站的代表关于亦工亦农亦兵全党全民办运输的经验介绍，参观了官亭、小坝、漯河地方办运输的情况，并且交流了各地的经验。代表们一致认为，官亭、小坝等地群众办运输的经验，不仅为解决车站堵塞问题找到了办法，并且为今后群众办运输开辟了一条广阔的道路。这些地区的车站今年在工农业大跃进中曾一度出现堵塞现象。但是，这些地区的人民在当地党委的领导下，破除了办铁路运输的神秘观点，批判了铁路运输与我无关和办运输妨碍生产等片面思想，迅速地组织起搬运队伍。官亭、小坝人民公社分别在车站附近建立了一支亦工亦农亦兵的运输大军，有车就装卸，有货就搬运，无车无货就种田、办工厂、学习和练兵。漯河市也组织了铁路运输基干队、常备队和后备队，同时实行了铁路、公路、航运、搬运四合一的办法。会议要求各地认真学习这些地区的经验。
    会议指出，今年以来，在工农业全面大跃进的带动下，全国铁路运输也出现了大跃进的局面。过去铁路运输每天只能装二万多车，现在每天增长到三万多车，车辆周转时间也比过去大大缩短。但是，这还远不能满足形势发展的需要。要使铁路真正发挥“先行官”的巨大作用，必须坚决学会两条腿走路，一方面铁路部门必须大搞“大洋群”，尽一切努力加快铁路复线的修建和机车车辆的制造，使其尽快地投入运输，另一方面，还必须走“小土群”的道路，发动群众大搞运输运动。
    会议在总结了官亭、小坝等地的经验之后，认为发动群众办运输主要的好处是：第一，保证了铁路运输，满足了公社对铁路的需要，促进了公社工农业的发展；第二，培养了装卸技术人材，发挥了铁路运输设备的效率，加速了车辆的周转；第三，建立亦工亦农亦兵的运输大军，可以综合使用劳力，适应中间站运量不平衡的特点；第四，使铁路运输和装卸工作方面的技术改革有了广大的群众基础。
    会议认为，目前发动群众大搞运输，应该提倡边干边学边提高的作法，号召群众大办快办，在普及的基础上再逐步巩固提高。同时，要发动群众，因地制宜，开展技术革命，调整劳动组织，改进操作方法，做到多快好省。（附图片）
