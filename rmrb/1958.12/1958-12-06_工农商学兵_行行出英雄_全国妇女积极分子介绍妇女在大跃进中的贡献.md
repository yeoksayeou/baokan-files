Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The National Women Activists in Socialist Construction Representative Conference began its plenary session today. Female heroes from all walks of life – workers, peasants, businessmen, students, and soldiers – presented to the conference the enormous contributions women have made to the motherland and the people during the Great Leap Forward.

At today's conference, the speeches of several female activists from the industrial front vividly demonstrated that they have made significant contributions with their wisdom and labor in both modern large-scale industries and the nationwide movement of running industries. The Yishi Juan Group of the Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill, which has been recognized as an advanced model group in Shanghai and nationwide for five consecutive years, has continuously achieved outstanding results in this year's Great Leap Forward: the speed of the 21s yarn spindles has increased from 285 revolutions per minute to the current 400 revolutions per minute; the unit output has reached 42.77 kilograms; and the daily output has increased from 2,050 pounds to 3,300 pounds. In the recent red flag competition launched by the factory, "Learn from Experts, Catch up with Experts, Surpass Experts," all the group's machines were decorated with red flags. Yishi Juan, the group's representative, introduced the process of their creating high output, high quality, and high technology in her speech today. Zhang Shufang from Guiyang City and Xiao Dezhi from Harbin City both used moving stories in their speeches to illustrate that housewives can also play a role in the nationwide movement of running industries. Zhang Shufang is a housewife from Yunyan District, Guiyang City. Not long ago, she and four other housewives established a "Hardware and Auto Repair Factory." In half a year, the factory has grown to more than 120 employees and accumulated more than 2,000 yuan in capital. These housewives, who originally did not understand technology, have now become blacksmiths, fitters, and lathe operators, and some have even learned to repair auto parts. Xiao Dezhi is now the captain of the Women's Construction Team of the Harbin No. 1 Engineering Company, which is composed of 63 family members of employees. They once successfully completed the construction of a three-story building in 43 days.

Two representatives of female activists active on the agricultural front spoke at the meeting today. Chen Shuzhen, director of the "March 8th" People's Commune in Su County, Anhui Province, reported on the great victory her commune achieved in the battle of making the area into a network of rivers. She said that after a hard winter and a vigorous spring, the entire commune dug 69 rivers, 390 ditches, and 140 ponds, with earthwork exceeding the total of water conservancy projects built in the past eight years. The women of this commune have also made outstanding achievements in the river network project. Many projects are named after "March 8th," among which the "March 8th" River, "Mulan" River, and "Guiying" River are the most famous. Because the area was made into a network of rivers, the average grain yield per mu of their entire commune reached 508 jin this year, an increase of nearly four times compared to before liberation, and an increase of 200 jin compared to last year's yield per mu. Xie Qiaoyue, a woman from Dasong Village, Ren County, Hebei Province, talked about her contributions to the agricultural technology innovation movement in her speech. She was originally a military officer's family member. Last spring, she responded to the government's call and returned to her hometown to participate in agricultural production. In production, she studied diligently and painstakingly, and successively trial-produced manure carts, hollow hoes, hand-operated washing machines, and solar stoves. In addition, she also jointly created and improved dense planting drills, corn threshers, slicing (shredding) machines, flying bow belts, corn stalk syrup, and grass ink. Among them, the manure cart can increase efficiency by five and a half times, enabling the entire village to deliver 3.25 million jin of fertilizer in ten days, completing the task one month ahead of schedule.

Liu Yazhu, the director of the Women's Federation of the Ant People's Commune in Putuo County, Zhejiang Province, which was the first to raise the banner of the People's Commune, introduced their production labor on the motherland's ocean in her speech. In response to the Party's call to combine fishing and agriculture, women implemented the policy of men going to sea and women cultivating the land, contracting to cultivate more than 700 mu of land on the entire island, with very good harvests. There are also 151 women on the island who are able to go to sea for production, and two have become skilled boat captains. The women have also supported the mechanization of fishing on the island with their labor and savings.

One female activist from the commercial front also spoke today. She is Cao Xiulan, a salesperson at the Jiefang Road branch of the Xi'an Department Store. She originally worked in the personnel department, but was later transferred to sales. At first, she did not understand the job, but after the Party's education, her ideology and work have undergone great changes. In the half-year period from March to September this year, she received more than 240 written praises from customers and was named one of the "Ten Flowers" of the Xi'an commercial system.

Qu Shufeng, a female student in the Architecture Department of Tsinghua University who came from a peasant background, vividly illustrated that under the leadership of the Party, children of workers and peasants have infinitely broad prospects. Before entering university, Qu Shufeng had only attended three and a half years of primary school and three years of a worker-peasant quick-study middle school. She came to the university to study architecture with the good wish of building more houses for the people and meeting the people's production and living needs. However, she was subjected to various kinds of sarcasm and discrimination from some teachers and students in the school who had serious bourgeois ideas. Qu Shufeng did not forget that she was a Communist Party member and that she must be brave in overcoming difficulties and fighting against all bourgeois ideas. Under the leadership of the Party organization, regardless of any sarcasm or attacks, she was determined to expose the superstitions in architecture. Over the past four years, her studies have continuously improved. The most difficult watercolor class has risen from three points to five points. The teachers who originally had no confidence in her had to admit that she had made a leap forward in her studies. Recently, Qu Shufeng and her classmates participated in the design of an important construction project in the capital. Construction has now begun on the construction site according to the drawings they designed.

Cao Siying, a rural female activist from Jiangxi Province, proved the inexhaustible wisdom and talent of the working people from another aspect with her own experience today. This rural girl, who graduated from elementary school, not only learned agricultural production knowledge but also mastered cultural knowledge in more than a year of labor training. In the five months of this year alone, she wrote more than 350 folk songs and twelve local dramas, which played a good role in promoting production and central work.

Lu Taoying, an engineer from the Instrument Research Factory of the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, introduced the situation of the entire staff of the instrument research group in her speech, relying on the Party and the masses to vigorously tackle cutting-edge technologies and create new instruments and equipment. She said that through the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle over the past year, she realized that intellectuals would achieve nothing if they left the Party's leadership. She also further realized that as a proletarian fighter, she must be both red and expert, must strengthen the study of political theory, and constantly transform her thinking. She expressed her determination to dedicate herself to the Party's cause and the cause of communism.

Li Lanying, a representative of the former General Hospital of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, vividly introduced many touching deeds of female medical personnel of the Volunteer Army in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in her speech. She said that during the war, a head nurse risked her life under enemy bombs to rescue the wounded more than a dozen times and finally gave her life; a nurse named Zhu Yong had to break the ice river to wash gauze every year in the severe winter, and her hands were often frozen with blood. After the Korean armistice, there were also many moving stories in the activities of helping the Korean people rebuild their homes. A female comrade in a clinic transfused more than 1,000 CC of blood to save the life of a Korean worker who had his legs severed by a train; in another hospital, where female comrades accounted for half of the staff, they treated more than 1,200 Korean residents in the area within a year, and they forged a deep friendship with the Korean people. In her speech, Li Lanying stated that the female comrades of the Volunteer Army must learn from the people of the motherland and learn from women across the country after returning home, and contribute everything they have to the new battles and work posts.

Wu Mingzhu, from Tapu Village, Hecuo Township, Xiamen City, on the frontline of the Fujian coast, also spoke at the meeting today. This Communist Party member, who is almost fifty years old, is now the secretary of the Party branch of the Qianxian Brigade of the Qianxian People's Commune there. Since 1954, she has continuously made outstanding achievements in security and defense and supporting the frontline. She told everyone vivid stories about her covering the evacuation of the masses, helping the troops wash and mend clothes and delivering soup and water, and supporting the militia in standing guard and patrolling, which showed her selfless and selfless noble quality of "wholeheartedly supporting the front," which deeply moved the audience.

A total of twelve people spoke at the conference today. On the 6th, the conference will conduct group discussions.

    工农商学兵  行行出英雄
    全国妇女积极分子介绍妇女在大跃进中的贡献
    新华社5日讯  全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议今天开始大会发言。工农商学兵各路女英雄向大会介绍了妇女们在全民大跃进中为祖国和人民作出的巨大贡献。
    在今天的大会上，几位来自工业战线上的妇女积极分子的发言，生动地表明，她们在近代化的大型工业中和全民办工业的运动中，都以自己的智慧和劳动作出巨大的贡献。曾经连续五年被评为上海市和全国的先进模范小组的上海国棉二厂裔式娟小组，在今年大跃进中，不断创造了出色的成绩：二十一支纱的车速从每分钟二百八十五转加快到现在的四百转；单位产量达到四十二点七七公斤；日产量从二千零五十磅提高到三千三百磅。在最近厂里开展的“学能手、赶能手、超能手”的红旗竞赛中，这个小组的车全部都插上了红旗。这个小组的代表裔式娟今天在发言中介绍了她们创造高产、高质、高技术的过程。贵阳市的张淑芳和哈尔滨市的萧德芝在发言中，都以动人的事迹说明在全民办工业运动中，家庭妇女也一样可以发挥作用。张淑芳是贵阳市云岩区的家庭妇女，不久前她和另外四个家庭妇女一起办了一个“五金汽车修配厂”。半年来，这个厂已发展到一百二十多个职工，积累了二千多元资金，这些原来不懂技术的家庭妇女，现在已经成了锻工、钳工、车工，有的还学会了修理汽车零件。萧德芝现在是哈尔滨第一工程公司妇女建筑队队长，这个队是由六十三名职工家属组成的。她们曾经在四十三天内，胜利完成一座三层大楼的施工任务。
    活跃在农业战线上的妇女积极分子们，今天有两个代表在会上发言。安徽省宿县“三八”人民公社主任陈淑贞报告了她所领导的公社，在河网化的战斗中取得的巨大胜利。她说，经过苦战一冬大干一春，全社挖了六十九条河、三百九十条沟、一百四十口塘，土方工程超过八年来兴修水利工程的总和。这个社的妇女们在河网化中也做出了出色的成就，许多工程都以“三八”命名，其中以“三八”河、“木兰”河、“桂英”河最为著名。因为实现了河网化，她们全社今年粮食亩产量平均达到五百零八斤，比解放前增产了将近四倍，比去年的亩产量也增加了二百斤。河北省任县大宋村妇女谢巧月在发言中谈到她在农业技术革新运动方面所作的贡献。她原来是个军官家属，去年春天响应政府号召，回到家乡参加农业生产。在生产中她勤学苦钻，先后试制成送粪小车、空心锄、手摇洗衣机、太阳炉，另外还和别人共同创造、改制了密植耧、玉米脱粒机、切片（丝）机、飞弓带磨、玉米秸制糖稀、草制墨汁等。其中送粪小车可以提高效率五倍半，使全村在十天内就送肥三百二十五万斤，提前一个月完成任务。
    最早举起人民公社旗帜的浙江省普陀县蚂蚁人民公社的妇联主任刘亚珠，在发言中介绍了她们在祖国海洋上的生产劳动。妇女们响应党的渔农结合的号召，实行男下海、女耕种，包种了全岛七百多亩土地，收成很好。全岛还有一百五十一个妇女能够下海生产，有两个人已成为技术熟练的船老大。妇女们还以自己的劳动和积蓄支援了岛上的渔业机帆化。
    今天发言的人，有一位商业战线上的妇女积极分子。她是西安市百货公司解放路门市部的营业员曹秀兰，原来在人事科当职员，后来调去售货，开始时思想不通，经过党的教育，思想上工作上都有很大转变。在今年3月到9月的半年时间里，就受到顾客二百四十多次书面表扬，并且被评为西安市商业系统的“十枝花”之一。
    一个农民出身的大学生——清华大学建筑系女学生曲淑凤的发言，生动地说明了在党所领导下的学校里，工农子弟有着无限广阔的前途。曲淑凤在进大学以前只上过三年半小学和三年工农速成中学，她是怀着要多为人民盖些房子、满足人民的生产和生活要求的美好愿望，来到大学学建筑的。但她在学校里却受到一些存在着严重的资产阶级思想的教师和学生的种种讽刺和歧视。曲淑凤没有忘记自己是个共产党员，要勇于克服困难，向一切资产阶级思想作斗争。她在党组织的领导下，不顾任何讽刺打击，决心揭破建筑上的迷信。四年来，她的学习不断地进步，最困难的水彩课已由三分升到五分，原来对她没有信心的教师也不得不承认她在学习上有了跃进。最近，曲淑凤和同学们一起参加了首都一项重要建筑工程的设计，现在工地上已经按照她们设计的图纸动工了。
    江西省的农村妇女积极分子曹嗣英，今天以她自己的经历，从另一个方面证明了工农劳动人民的无穷无尽的智慧和才能。这个小学毕业的农村姑娘，在一年多的劳动锻炼中，不仅学会了农业生产知识，还学好了文化知识。仅在今年的五个月中，她就写出了三百五十余首山歌和十二个地方剧，对推动生产和中心工作起了良好的作用。
    一位女科学工作者——水利电力部水利科学研究院工程师卢萄英，在她的发言里介绍了她所在的仪器研究工厂仪器研究小组全体人员，依靠党依靠群众猛攻尖端技术创造新仪器新设备的情况。她说，一年来，通过整风和反右派斗争，使她认识到知识分子如果离开党的领导必将一事无成，也进一步认识到作为一个无产阶级的战士必须又红又专，必须加强政治理论学习，不断改造自己的思想。她表示，她决心要为党的事业为共产主义事业而献身。
    前中国人民志愿军总医院的代表李兰英，在发言里生动地介绍了志愿军女医务人员们在抗美援朝斗争中许多可歌可泣的事迹。她说，在战争时期，有一位护士长曾经在敌人的炸弹下，往返十多次抢救伤员，终于献出了自己的生命；有一位名叫朱勇的护士，每年在严寒的冬季里都要打开冰河去洗纱布，经常是双手冻得裂满了血口。朝鲜停战以后，在帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的活动中，也有不少动人的故事。有一个门诊部的女同志为了抢救一位被火车轧断双腿的朝鲜工人的生命，曾经输出了一千多CC的血；在另外一个女同志占半数的医院里，一年内共为驻地朝鲜居民治疗了一千二百多人次，她们和朝鲜人民结下了深厚的友情。李兰英在发言中表示，志愿军的女同志们回国以后，一定要向祖国人民学习，向全国妇女学习，在新的战斗和工作岗位上贡献出自己的一切。
    今天在会上发言的还有来自福建海防前线厦门市何厝乡塔埔村的吴明珠。这个快五十岁的共产党员现在是那里的前线人民公社前线大队的党支部书记。她从1954年起，就一直在治安保卫和支援前线的工作中不断做出出色的成绩。她向大家叙述了她在掩护群众疏散、帮助部队洗补衣服和送汤送水、支援民兵站岗放哨等方面的生动故事，说明了她的那种忘我无私地“一心为支前”的高贵品质，使人们听了都深为感动。
    今天在大会上发言的共十二人。6日，大会将进行小组讨论。
