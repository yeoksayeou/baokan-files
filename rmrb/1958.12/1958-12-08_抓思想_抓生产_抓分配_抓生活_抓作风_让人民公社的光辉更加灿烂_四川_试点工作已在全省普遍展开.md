Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 5th: A mass movement centered on rectifying, consolidating, and improving the People's Communes has begun in Sichuan Province. Currently, pilot work has been universally unfolded in various regions.

Prior to the commencement of this comprehensive commune rectification work, Sichuan, since the second half of November, had first focused on rectifying some prominent and urgent problems in the communes, and had grasped the establishment of some important systems, especially in running the public canteens and collective living well. The majority of areas in the province conducted inspections and rectifications of the canteen work through convening specialized meetings, on-site meetings, and visits. In Luzhou Special District, over 30,000 canteens mobilized the masses, cleared out impure elements who had infiltrated canteen work, democratically elected cooks, formulated canteen agreements, and universally established vegetable bases. According to surveys in many areas such as Luzhou, Daxian, Wanxian, and Jiangjin, the third-category canteens that were run relatively poorly have generally decreased to below 10%, and a large number of canteens have reached the standards of eating one's fill, eating well, eating thriftily, eating hot food, eating cooked food, and eating cleanly. Simultaneously, a great deal of work has also been carried out in running nurseries and "happiness homes" (homes for the elderly) well, and several hundred thousand nursery workers have been trained in various regions.

In order to change the phenomenon in some areas where no one was specifically responsible for production in the implementation of large-scale campaigns, various regions focused on promoting the responsibility system in management, closely combined with the production of spring crops. Some regions have also begun to adjust cultivated areas and implement labor quota management. All regions paid attention to combining work with rest, with two days off per month, and ensuring that commune members had eight hours of sleep each day.

Guangdong: First Secretaries in Various Localities Go to the Countryside to Focus on Key Areas First
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 5th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has decided to fully rectify and consolidate the People's Communes, and requires all localities to thoroughly prepare for spring plowing on the basis of rectifying and consolidating the People's Communes, and to organize a larger and more comprehensive leap forward in next year's production.

On the evening of the 3rd, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CCP convened a telephone conference attended by secretaries of local committees. The meeting decided that the Provincial Committee, local committees, and county committees would jointly organize a ten-thousand-person inspection team to go deep into the People's Communes to conduct a comprehensive inspection, so as to further consolidate the People's Communes and greatly improve the level of various tasks of the People's Communes. The meeting also studied the steps of commune rectification and other issues, and required the first secretaries of local Party committees to quickly lead work teams to the countryside, focus on key areas first, and address pressing issues such as livelihood welfare and distribution, while gradually expanding the scope on a broad front.

The meeting believed that in order to lay a material foundation for the People's Communes economically, it is necessary to combine commune rectification with immediately starting diversified operations and vigorously developing sideline production while doing a good job in grain and steel production, so as to meet the needs of national economic construction and people's livelihood, and enable the communes to increase cash income and solve the current problems of production funds and wage distribution. The meeting criticized the phenomenon in some communes' pig raising, where they put the commune before the state, only paying attention to self-sufficiency production and not to commodity production. The meeting strongly emphasized that in comprehensively developing various productions, industrial and agricultural production should be carried out simultaneously, and self-sufficiency production and commodity production should be given equal consideration, according to the principles of national unified planning and adapting to local conditions. The meeting required all localities to take this guiding ideology as the basis for organizing production and formulating next year's production plans.

Fujian: Vigorously Grasp Commune Work and Vigorously Grasp Winter Production
According to Fujian Daily news: The Fujian Provincial Party Committee recently convened a meeting of secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees, deciding to use four months to effectively run the People's Communes, set off a high tide of winter production, and strive for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year.

The meeting emphasized that the key to realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1959 lies in effectively running the People's Communes. Starting from December, the first secretaries should take the lead, vigorously grasp the work of the People's Communes, and vigorously grasp winter production. Prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees should immediately run a commune well, create experience, and guide overall work. Communes should currently pay attention to grasping the following issues:

(1) Grasp ideology: combine current work and the masses' thinking, conduct in-depth socialist and communist propaganda and education, publicize the nature of the communes and the superiority of the communes, and improve the socialist ideological awareness of commune members. (2) Grasp production: grasp next year's production plan; grasp deep plowing, water conservancy, fertilizer, tool reform, and afforestation and logging; labor should be rationally organized and arranged, and a combination of mass movements and professional teams should be adopted. (3) Grasp distribution: After deducting state taxes and the commune's public accumulation, the commune should ensure that the income of commune members is higher than last year. Attention should be paid to developing diversified economy and sideline production to increase the income of commune members. (4) Grasp life: Public canteens and nurseries must be run well, and the daily rest time of commune members must be guaranteed. In addition, sanitation work should also be done well. (5) Grasp work style: Adhere to persuasion and education, not coercion. While implementing the "three-izations" of organizing militarily, acting in a battle-ready manner, and collectivizing life in the commune, democratic management should be added. An honest attitude must be adhered to, and a bragging style must be opposed.

Jiangsu: Decided to "Combine Points and Surfaces, Operate in Stages"
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 7th: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has decided to dispatch cadres from the provincial, prefectural, and county levels in batches, forming a ten-thousand-person inspection team, to conduct a thorough rectification and consolidation of all People's Communes in the province from December this year to April next year. The first batch of more than 140 cadres drawn from provincial-level organs has been led by responsible cadres of the Provincial Party Committee, forming seven working groups to go to seven special zones to conduct commune rectification pilot work.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CCP believes that the commune rectification work, which takes production as the center and closely combines production to carry out socialist and communist education, must distinguish between priorities and urgency, and proceed in stages, with each stage having a focus. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee decided to adopt the method of "combining points and surfaces, operating in stages." From the perspective of the entire province, the commune rectification work is roughly divided into three stages. From now until around the Winter Solstice is the first stage, focusing on grasping production, grasping distribution, grasping life, and grasping sideline production, and effectively solving the problem of commune members spending the winter; at the same time, closely combining production, rectifying labor organization, and combining distribution to check financial accounts; the second stage will take about one and a half months to concentrate on grasping the management of the commune, especially financial management; and then allocate a period of time to rectify the organization.

In order to do a thorough and meticulous job in commune rectification, the Provincial Party Committee requires Party committee secretaries at all levels to take the lead, organize capable forces, and go deep into one or two communes to conduct pilot projects. After gaining experience, necessary on-site meetings will be held, where the pilot communes will introduce the situation and experience, and the county and district Party committees will arrange the commune rectification work according to the situation of each commune, so as to promote the commune rectification work from point to surface, combining points and surfaces, and quickly and thoroughly.

Shandong: Resolutely Ensure that the Inspection Team is a Working Team
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: The production and living inspection teams of leading organs and various localities in Shandong Province have been formed and are about to go deep into the People's Communes to carry out a mass work inspection to specifically help grassroots organizations consolidate and improve the People's Communes.

The Shandong Provincial Party Committee has determined that in the inspection work, it will continue to implement the spirit of taking steel as the key link, promoting steel production on the one hand, and focusing on inspecting and promoting wheat field management, labor management, and distribution work on the other hand, arranging the lives of commune members and running collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly well; pay attention to understanding the implementation of various specific policies in the People's Communes and the existing problems; pay attention to discovering and carrying forward the working methods of the mass line such as democratic management, and assist the People's Communes in doing a good job in rectification and consolidation.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the CCP requires inspection teams at all levels to universally go deep into communes and teams, participate in production and various management activities, and combine participating in labor, analyzing problems, and helping communes and teams solve problems, and resolutely ensure that the inspection team is also a working team that specifically helps production, distribution, and commune consolidation, and comprehensively promotes production, commune rectification, and the progress of various tasks.

Hubei: Emphasizes Visits and Comparisons and Holding On-Site Meetings
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 7th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has decided to organize a ten-thousand-person inspection team to conduct a province-wide production and life inspection of People's Communes starting from December 15th.

The main contents of this inspection are the production construction, production planning, distribution situation, life and welfare, and operation management of the People's Communes. The main methods of inspection are to carry out visits and comparisons between People's Communes and between neighboring counties or special zones, combine key inspections with on-site meetings, promote achievements, correct shortcomings, promptly solve the current problems in rural production and life, and promote successful experiences. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the CCP emphasized: In the inspection, it is necessary to advocate the mass line, seek truth from facts, and promote a hardworking and simple work style. Make the vast number of cadres good at combining revolutionary enthusiasm for daring to think and daring to do with a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, and combine going all out with caring for the lives of the masses. Through this great inspection, we must effectively implement the Party's policies, promote the consolidation of the People's Communes, and promote a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production next year.

In order to urge everyone to attach importance to this ten-thousand-person inspection, Wang Renzhong, the first secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CCP, spoke at a broadcast conference listened to by nearly ten million people in the province on the evening of the 4th, requesting Party organizations at all levels to comprehensively grasp ideology, production, and life.

    让人民公社的光辉更加灿烂
    四川  试点工作已在全省普遍展开
    据新华社成都5日电  一个以整顿、巩固和提高人民公社为中心的群众运动已在四川省开始。目前各地的试点工作已经普遍展开。
    在这次全面整社工作开始以前，四川各地从11月下半月以来，首先针对公社中一些突出而迫切需要解决的问题着手进行了整顿，抓紧建立了一些重要制度，特别是搞好公共食堂和集体生活。全省大多数地方都通过召开专业会、现场会以及参观访问等方式，对食堂工作进行了检查和整顿。泸州专区的三万多个食堂，发动群众，清除了混入食堂工作的不纯分子，民主选举了炊事员，制订了食堂公约，普遍建立了蔬菜基地。据泸州、达县、万县、江津等不少地区调查，目前办的较差的三类食堂一般都下降到10％以下，大批食堂达到了吃的饱、吃的好、吃的节省、吃的热、吃的熟、吃的干净的标准。和这同时，对办好托儿所、幸福院也进行了不少工作，各地训练的保育员已有几十万人。
    为了改变有些地区在实行大兵团作战中生产无专人负责的现象，各地在经营管理上着重结合小春生产大力推行了责任制。有些地区还开始调整耕作区，实行劳动定额管理。各地注意劳逸结合，每月放假两天，每天保证社员睡足八小时。
    广东  各地第一书记下乡先搞重点
    据新华社广州5日电  中共广东省委决定全力整顿巩固人民公社，并且要求各地在整顿巩固人民公社的基础上，狠狠的搞好备耕工作，组织明年生产更大、更全面的跃进。
    3日晚上，中共广东省委召开了有各地委书记参加的电话会议。会上决定，由省委和地委、县委共同组织万人检查团，深入人民公社，进行全面检查，使人民公社进一步巩固起来，并把人民公社的各项工作水平大大提高一步。会上还研究了整社的步骤等问题，要求各地党委第一书记迅速带领工作组下乡，先搞重点，抓住生产和当前比较突出的问题如生活福利、分配问题等加以解决，同时在面上逐步铺开。
    会议认为：为了从经济上给人民公社打下物质基础，必须结合整社工作，在搞好粮食和钢铁生产的同时，立即动手开展多种经营，大力搞好副业生产，以满足国民经济建设和人民生活的需要，并且使公社增加现金收入，解决当前生产资金和发放工资等问题。会议对于目前部分公社在养猪方面那种先公社后国家，只注意自给生产而不注意商品生产的现象，进行了批判。会议十分强调指出：在全面发展各项生产时，应该根据国家统一计划与因地制宜的原则，实行工业与农业并举，自给生产与商品生产同时兼顾。会议要求各地把这个指导思想作为今后组织生产和拟订明年生产规划的根据。
    福建  大抓公社工作大抓冬季生产
    据福建日报消息  福建省委最近召开地、市、县委书记会议，决定以四个月时间，切实办好人民公社，掀起冬季大生产高潮，力争明年农业更大跃进。
    会议强调，实现1959年农业生产的大跃进，关键在于切实办好人民公社。从12月份起，由第一书记挂帅，大抓人民公社工作，大抓冬季生产。地、市、县委当前要立即搞好一个公社，创造经验，指导全面。公社当前应注意抓下述问题：
    （一）抓思想：结合当前工作和群众思想，深入进行社会主义和共产主义宣传教育，宣传公社的性质和公社的优越性，提高社员的社会主义思想觉悟。（二）抓生产：抓明年生产计划；抓深翻土、水利、肥料、工具改革和造林、伐木等工作；劳力应作合理组织安排，采取群众运动和专业队相结合的办法。（三）抓分配：公社扣除国家税收和社的公共积累外，应使社员的收入比去年有所增加。应注意搞多种经济和副业生产，以增加社员收入。（四）抓生活：一定要把公共食堂、托儿所办好，同时必须保证社员每天的休息时间。此外，还要做好卫生工作。（五）抓作风：坚持说服教育，不能压服，在公社实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的“三化”的同时，应当加上管理民主化。必须坚持老实态度，反对虚夸作风。
    江苏  决定“点面结合，分段作业”
    据新华社南京7日电  中共江苏省委决定分批抽调省、地、县三级干部，组成万人检查团，从今年12月到明年4月，对全省所有的人民公社进行一次深入的整顿巩固工作。从省级机关第一批抽调出来的一百四十多名干部，已分别由省委负责干部率领，组成七个工作组前往七个专区，进行整社试点工作。
    中共江苏省委认为以生产为中心，紧密结合生产开展社会主义和共产主义教育的整社工作，必须分清先后缓急，分段进行，每段都有重点。因此，省委决定采取“点面结合、分段作业”的方法。从全省范围来说，整社工作大体上分三段进行。从现在开始到冬至前后为第一段，着重抓生产、抓分配、抓生活、抓副业，切实解决社员的过冬问题；同时紧密结合生产，整顿劳动组织，结合分配，检查财务账目；第二段拿出一个半月左右时间，集中力量抓公社的经营管理问题，特别是财务管理；然后再划出一段时间，整顿组织。
    为了深入细致地做好整社工作，省委要求各级党委书记挂帅，组织精干力量，深入一两个公社进行试点。取得了经验，就召开必要的现场会议，由试点社介绍情况和经验，由县区党委根据各公社情况，布置整社工作，做到以点带面，点面结合，又细又快地把整社工作推开。
