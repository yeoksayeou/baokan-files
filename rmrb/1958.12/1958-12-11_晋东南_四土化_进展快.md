    Southeastern Shanxi's "Four Indigenizations" (indigenous mechanization, indigenous electrification, indigenous railway construction, and indigenous lathe construction) movement has made rapid progress based on overfulfilling steel production tasks. In just twenty days, the entire special district has manufactured 1,589 various indigenous machine tools, 226 indigenous electric motors, and more than 151,000 pieces of various indigenous machinery such as ore crushers, circulating threading machines, and ball mills. In addition, 33 indigenous railways with a total length of more than 647 kilometers have already begun surveying and track laying.

    In order to trial-produce indigenous machinery, workers have offered suggestions and ideas. Workers at the agricultural machinery factory used the method of "turning large into small and merging small into large" to make large machines. Factories and mines in Changzhi City manufactured 763 machine tools in one week, including gantry planers, shapers, and many other indigenous machines. The rotary tractor trial-produced by the Qin County United Factory only requires one person to operate and can plow eleven mu of land per day.

    晋东南“四土化”进展快
    本报讯  山西省晋东南专区“四土化”（土机械化、土电机化、土铁路化、土车床化）运动，在超额完成钢铁生产任务的基础上，有了飞速的发展。仅仅在二十天内，全专区已造出各种土机床一千五百八十九台，土电机二百二十六台，矿石粉碎机、循环套丝机、球磨机等各种土机械十五万一千多件；还有三十三条全长六百四十七公里多的土铁路，已经开始勘察、铺轨。
    为了试制土机械，工人们纷纷献策献计。农业机械厂的工人采用大化小、小并大的办法做出了大机器。长治市各厂矿一星期就制造出七百六十三台机床，其中包括龙门刨、牛头刨，还有许多土机械。沁县联合厂试制成的旋转式拖拉机，只要一个人操作，一天就可以耕地十一亩。
