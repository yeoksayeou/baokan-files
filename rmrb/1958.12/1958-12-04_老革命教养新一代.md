    Old Revolutionaries Educate the New Generation
    By Our Correspondent Wang Jianlin
    At the Shandong Province Preschool Education Conference, a group of young women surrounded an elderly woman, asking questions. Attracted by this scene, I went over to inquire and learned that this elderly woman was Wang Yulan, a childcare teacher from the Xuzhuang Kindergarten in the Guyunji Production Management Area of the Fan County People's Commune. The young women said: Her deeds are so touching! When she spoke at the conference, everyone listened intently. Now, many preschool education units in Jinan City have asked her to give reports after the meeting. One afternoon, I visited Wang Yulan. Here's what she said:

    When the kindergarten was first established, we didn't have any toys. How could we keep the children entertained? The children loved to work, so I led them to the Jin Di River to learn how to pound earth like the adults. We tied bricks or stones together to use as pounders, six children in a group. The children pounded away enthusiastically! They were so busy playing that they didn't fight or miss home. I said from the side: Let's see who pounds the best, and I'll give them a little red flag. When the children got tired, I told them stories. What kind of stories? I said: The Jin Di River burst its banks, and it will flood many fields and villages. If we build the dyke, it won't flood. The river water can also be used to irrigate the fields, the crops will grow well, and we will harvest more grain. These weren't really stories, but the children's eyes widened as they listened to me. The games I led the children in were all related to labor. I taught the children to use small stones as cotton seeds and learn how to plant cotton, and to use wooden sticks as hoes to learn how to hoe the ground. Whatever the season, I taught the children to do whatever was appropriate. This autumn, the children went to the fields to pick sweet potatoes and peanuts. Once, the commune cut more than twenty acres of corn stalks and piled them against the kindergarten wall. The commune members were busy and couldn't find time to husk them. So I led the children to husk corn during playtime for more than four days. We even had a competition while we husked, and whoever husked the most got a big red flower. Commune leader Xu Mingxian praised us, saying: Even small children can do big things!

    When playing around the house, I always pay attention to broadening the children's knowledge. The children like to ask questions, and I patiently explain things to them. Now they can recognize many kinds of crops and can distinguish between harmful insects and beneficial insects. They say the "ladybug" is a good insect because it eats aphids; the "earthworm" is also a good insect because it only burrows in the ground and doesn't bite crops. I often tell the children how pests "multiply" and how they should be eliminated. For example, when they see a "bean worm," I tell them how the "bean worm" turns into a pupa, grows into a moth, lays eggs, and then grows into small "bean worms." The children love to listen. At first, the children were very afraid when they saw such a big green worm and dared not touch it; later, after I told them it wouldn't bite, they were no longer afraid. The children and I often went to the fields to catch "melon bugs" to feed the chickens when it was getting dark. We also killed many flies in the campaign to eliminate the four pests.

    We can't just make the children work. They love to sing, so I compose songs as I go and teach them. The songs I teach include: "Little airplane, flying in the sky; flying east, flying west; please take me to Beijing to see our dear Chairman Mao!" "I am a little farmer, studying and farming; working hard during the busy season, learning when I have free time; people who don't study don't improve, people who don't work have no future." And: "Red flowers bloom in the green grass, little birds come out to play; we are all good children, coming to kindergarten to study." There are many more, I can't tell you all of them at once.

    At first, it was most difficult to distribute food to the children. They all stretched out their little hands, wanting to be the first to get food and wanting more. This autumn, the commune gave us some peanuts. Before distributing them to the children, I said: The older children should love and protect the younger brothers and sisters, let's see who listens and who doesn't snatch. Then, I started distributing from the smaller class. The older children clapped their hands to welcome the younger children, and there was no disorder at all. But the younger children still wanted more after eating, and the clever little Yuhuan said loudly: "I won't eat, give it to Baozhu." Other older children also shouted in unison: "I'll give it, I'll give it!" Usually, when a child falls, the older children help him up. Sometimes the older children take the younger children home, which saves us a lot of worry.

    I also often ask the children what they want to be when they grow up. "Workers, farmers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army!" Many small mouths answered in unison. The children are very different from when they first came. There is a six-year-old child whose father is over fifty years old and only has one son, so he is very spoiled! At home, he hits his mother and doesn't give anything to his sister. He changed after coming to kindergarten. He grabbed food and snatched things. After education, he got better. After the food was brought, he said: "Give it to others first, I'll wait!" He sat there motionless, and when he got home, he didn't scold his mother or beat his sister. Before leaving, he also said: "Mom, go to work! I'm going to play with the teacher!" There are many children like this who have made progress!

    The parents see that the children are well taken care of in the kindergarten and say: "Giving the child to you is better than having them in our own hands, we can put our hearts at ease. This one wants me to make a pair of shoes for her, that one wants me to make a big cotton coat. The children are also very affectionate to me, they come up and snuggle as soon as they see me, all over my arms and back, I'm like an old hen."

    Before leaving after the interview, I asked Wang Yulan about her past. She told me that she joined the Party in 1942, is fifty-four years old this year, is now a member of the Party branch committee, and a delegate to the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province. I thought: The children raised in the hands of such a mother, in the hands of such a revolutionary veteran with seventeen years of Party membership, will never be fragile flowers and plants in a greenhouse, but must be strong pines on the mountains, unafraid of wind, frost, and sun.

    老革命教养新一代
    本报记者  王建林
    在山东省幼儿教育会议上，一群年轻的姑娘围着一个老大娘，问这问那。我被这种情景所吸引，走近前一问，原来这位老大娘是范县人民公社古云集生产管理区徐庄幼儿园的保育教师王玉兰。年轻姑娘们说：她的事迹可动人啦！她在大会上发言的时候，大家都听呆了。现在济南市的好多幼儿教养单位都约她会后去作报告。一天下午，我去访问了王玉兰，下面是她讲的话：
    幼儿园刚成立起来，没有玩具，咋让孩子玩？孩子们好劳动，我就领他们到金堤河旁，学着大人的样子打硪。用砖或是石头绑起来，当硪，六个孩子一班。孩子们打的可热闹啦！光顾玩也不打架、不想家了。我在一旁说：看谁打的好，给他插上个小红旗。孩子们快累了，再给他们讲故事。讲什么呢？我就说：金堤河开了口，要淹很多地、很多庄稼。打了堤就淹不了啦。用河的水还能浇地，庄稼长的好，粮食打的多。这不是什么故事，可是孩子们的小眼都圆溜溜地瞪着我。我领孩子们玩的游戏，都是离不开劳动的。我叫孩子用小石子当棉籽学着点（种）棉花，用木棒当锄头学着锄地。到了什么季节，就教孩子干什么。今年秋天，孩子们到地里拾过红薯，拾过花生。有一回，社里砍了二十多亩地的棒子堆在幼儿园墙根，社员们忙，不得空剥。我就领孩子们在游戏的时间剥了四天多棒子。在剥的时候还竞赛哩，谁剥的多就给他带上一朵大红花。社长徐明先见了夸奖说：小孩子也能办大事啦！
    在家前屋后玩的时候，我随时注意让孩子们长见识。孩子们好问，我就很耐心地讲给他听。现在他们能认得很多种庄稼，还分得清啥是害虫，啥是好虫。他们说“花大姐”是好虫，它吃“蜜虫”子；“曲蝉”（蚯蚓）也是好虫，它光钻地不咬庄稼。我常告诉孩子们害虫是怎样“繁生”的，应当怎样消灭。比如说吧，看到“豆虫”，我就和他们说：“豆虫”怎样变成蛹，长出蛾，下了仔，又怎样长出小“豆虫”来。孩子们很爱听。开头，孩子们看到那么个大青虫子，很害怕，不敢动；以后听我说它不咬人，也就不怕了。我和孩子们常在天快黑的时候，到地里逮“老瓜虫”喂鸡。在除四害中，我们也打了不少苍蝇。
    不能光叫孩子们干活。他们很喜欢唱歌，我就随编随教。我教的歌有：“小飞机，天上飞；飞到东，飞到西；请你带我到北京去，看看亲爱的毛主席！”“我是小农民，读书又种地；农忙时候勤劳动，有了闲空就学习；人不学习不长进，人不劳动没出息。”还有：“红花开在绿草里，小鸟出来作游戏；我们都是好孩子，幼儿园里来学习。”还有很多，一时说不完。
    起初，给孩子们分东西吃是最难的事。都伸着小手先要，多要。今年秋天，社里给了点花生。在分给孩子们以前我先说：大孩子要爱护小弟弟、小妹妹，看谁听话，看谁不抢。随后，先从小班那头分。一边分，大孩子一边拍手欢迎，一点不乱。可是小些的孩子吃了还要，精明伶俐的小玉环大声说：“我不吃，给宝珠。”别的大孩子也齐声喊：“我给，我给！”平常那个孩子跌倒了，大孩子就把他拉起来。有时候大孩子送小孩子回家，省了我们很多心。
    我还常问孩子们长大了干什么？“当工人，当农民，当解放军！”很多张小嘴一齐回答。孩子们和刚来的时候大不一样了。有个六岁的孩子，他爹五十多岁，光他一个男孩，可娇惯啦！在家打他娘，吃啥不给他姐。来幼儿园后吃饭乱抓，见东西就抢。经教育后好了。饭端来后，他说：“先给别人，我待会吧！”坐在那里一动不动，到家不骂娘也不打姐姐了。临走时还说：“娘，你去干活吧！我跟老师去玩啦！”像这样有了进步的孩子可多着哪！
    家长们看到孩子们在幼儿园照料的很好，说：“孩子交给你，比在自己手里还强，把心放在肚子里了。这个要给我做双鞋，那个要给做件大棉袄。孩子们对我也挺亲，一见了就偎上来，怀里背上全是，我就像个老母鸡。”
    结束访问后临走时，我问了一下王玉兰过去的情形。她告诉我说，她是1942年入党的，今年五十四岁，现在是党支部委员，中国共产党山东省第一届党代表大会的代表。我想：在这样的母亲手里，在这样一位有着十七年党龄的革命前辈手里教养出来的孩子，绝不会是温室里弱不禁风的花草，而一定是高山上的劲松，不怕风吹霜打，日晒雨淋。
