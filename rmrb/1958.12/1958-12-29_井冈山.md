    Jinggang Mountain
    Wang Yeqiu
    I attended a national revolutionary cultural relics work conference in Jinggang Mountain and visited Ciping, Dajing, Xiaojing, and Zhushachong, one of the five major sentry posts. I was deeply moved and wrote this poem to commemorate the occasion:

  To see mountains, see Jinggang Mountain,
  The unfailing red flag planted for ten thousand years;
  A generation of upheaval started here,
  Indeed, a spark can ignite a prairie fire.

  To see mountains, see Jinggang Mountain,
  Green peaks and red skies;
  Not only does the verdant mountain still exist,
  But the stones laugh until their lips are dry. (Note)

  Note: At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army declared that they would "put every stone in Jinggang Mountain to the sword."

    井冈山
    王冶秋
    开革命文物工作现场会于井冈山一访茨坪，大井、小井及五大哨口之一的朱砂冲，感触实多，诗以记之：
  看山要看井冈山，
  不倒红旗插万年；
  一代风云从此起，
  果真星火可燎原。
  看山要看井冈山，
  绿满峰峦红满天；
  岂止青山依旧在，
  石头笑得口唇干。（注）
  注：当时蒋匪军曾声言要把井冈山石头都得“过刀”。
