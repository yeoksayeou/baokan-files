The Snow Citrus in Minhou Has a Great Harvest
(Our newspaper reports) The Dujuan Brigade of the Chengmen People's Commune in Minhou County, Fujian Province, harvested 43,718 catties of snow citrus in a 1.06-mu citrus orchard. The average yield per mu was 41,243 catties and 10 taels, an increase of 3.2 times compared to last year. The quality of the citrus is also very good, with a moist color, juicy and sweet taste, and 95% meeting export standards.

The Dujuan Brigade's snow citrus orchard has a total of 44 citrus trees, which were planted and cultivated by 73-year-old farmer Yang Zhaodong twenty-three years ago. Currently, they are in their peak growth period, with trees over two zhang high and dense foliage, covering a diameter of more than one zhang. Each tree produces as many as 2,200 fruits, with the average being around 2,000. Some fruits are the size of pomelos, and the abundant fruits weigh down the branches.

    闽侯雪柑大丰收
    本报讯  福建闽侯县城门人民公社杜园大队，在一块一点○六亩的柑园里，采收四万三千七百一十八斤雪柑，平均亩产四万一千二百四十三斤十两，比去年增产三点二倍。柑子的质量也很好，色润汁多又清甜，95％达到出口标准。
    杜园大队这块雪柑园共种柑子四十四株，是七十三岁老农杨兆栋在二十三年前一手栽种培育的，目前正是生长旺期，树高二丈余，枝叶茂密，复盖直径有一丈多，每株结果多的达二千二百多粒，一般的也有二千粒左右，有的像柚子大小，累累果实把树枝都压得低垂下来。
