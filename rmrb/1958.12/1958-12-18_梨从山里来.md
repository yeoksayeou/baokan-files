Pears from the Mountains
By our reporter Lü Suxuan

Recently, among the fruits sold in the Tianjin market, there have been several types of white pear, bo pear, and sour pear that were rare in the past, with ample supplies. These pears come from Qinglong County, Hebei Province, and the citizens are able to taste them thanks to a vivid story of urban-rural cooperation.

Cannot Let the Pears Rot on the Trees

Qinglong County is a mountainous county. Within its territory of more than two hundred *li*, fruit trees cover the mountains, with pear trees being the most numerous. This year, it is expected to produce more than ten million *jin*, but this year's great leap forward in agricultural production has caused a shortage of labor and transportation. The pear-picking season has passed, but most of the pears are still hanging on the trees. A portion of the pears that were picked cannot be transported out due to a lack of transportation. After learning about this situation, the Tianjin Sugar and Fruit Company immediately organized its employees to discuss it. They raised the question of what to do if the fruit cannot be collected and transported. After discussion, they unanimously agreed to organize employees to go to the countryside to help the people's communes with picking and purchasing.

On October 19th, led by the company's branch secretary, more than two hundred salesmen and cooks went to Qinglong County. The transportation department also dispatched twenty cars to participate in transportation.

The morning after arriving in Qinglong, the employees went to the mountains to pick pears while the sky was still twinkling with stars. Because picking pears requires certain skills, some young and strong employees participated in steelmaking, deep plowing, autumn harvesting, and other labor to replace the farmers in picking pears. Most of the employees sorted and packed the pears under the trees, and then carried them from the top of the mountain to the bottom for centralized transportation.

Here, the mountains are high and the slopes are steep. When people look down from the top of the mountain, donkeys look like small sheep, and adults look like five or six-year-old children. It is seven or eight *li* from the top of the mountain to the bottom. None of the employees had ever grown up in a mountain village, and some had never even seen high mountains before. The first time they climbed the mountain, they couldn't help but feel timid and their legs trembled. In order to pick the pears before *xiaoxue* (minor snow) and prevent any pears from freezing, they overcame difficulties. As a result, by November 22nd, the day before *xiaoxue*, all the pears on the pear trees had been picked.

Cars Entered the Deep Mountains for the First Time

Qinglong County, with its dense mountains, has very inconvenient transportation, with only one highway connecting the county people's committee to Luan County. This is located forty or fifty *li* away from the main pear-producing areas, with some as far as more than one hundred *li*. Although the car drivers had excellent driving skills, they had never driven on mountain roads before. Before they arrived, they thought they would transport the pears from the highway to the train station, but later they learned that all the county's only twenty cars had been put into the battle of steel transportation, and there was an extreme shortage of rural transportation. They could not transport the pears to the highway, so they needed to find a way to drive the cars in. Cao Shengyun, the car team leader, took the lead in driving a car to explore the road to the pear basket collection point. No matter how rugged the mountain road was, they rushed forward as long as the car could pass. Places like Badaohe and Sibozi were all winding mountain roads. From Badaohe to Luan County Station, it was necessary to pass thirty-six bends. Henglingzi had more than 200,000 *jin* of pears, but the mountain roads were difficult to navigate. One side was a cliff, and the other was a mountain stream. Large cars could not turn around and pass here. When the car drove here, the front wheels were about to hit the mountain wall, and the rear wheels almost fell into the mountain stream. It took the driver more than twenty minutes to turn around, and his arms were sore, but finally, hundreds of thousands of *jin* of pears were transported out. When encountering rugged and uneven mountain roads and deep water ditches, company employees and farmers would repair bridges and roads overnight. A makeshift bridge more than three *zhang* long, made of stones and trees, from Cuizhuangzi to Henglingzi, was built by more than fifty people in one night. In this way, while walking and repairing roads, the employees and commune members cooperated to build six makeshift bridges and repaired more than twenty *li* of roads, so that cars could travel to and from the sixteen collection points in this commune.

The drivers transported the pears day and night, traveling back and forth without empty loads. Their quilts were placed in the car boxes, and they often spent the night in the cars. After they transported the pears to Luan County Station, they took the opportunity to bring industrial products that had been backlogged at the station into the mountains. In the short first week, the Qinglong County people's urgently needed salt, cotton clothes, and cotton cloth were all transported.

As Close as a Family

On the walls of the streets of the Shuguang and Huojian People's Communes, there were many red and green big-character posters, which were posters from farmers praising the employees. In terms of living, the landlords took care of these new tenants even better than their own families. In the morning, before the employees got up, the steaming water for washing their faces had already been prepared. In the evening, not only was the drinking and washing water prepared, but also the *kang* was heated warmly. The employees felt sorry for the farmers' warm hospitality, so the next morning, they quietly got up early to boil water and sweep the yard, but the third day, the farmers got up even earlier than the employees. The farmers also took out the peanuts and chestnuts they had stored and fried them for the employees to eat when everyone returned to gather together in the evening. One night when the weather was about to change, the employees went to the mountains to cover the pear baskets. After returning home after 11 pm, Xue, the more than fifty-year-old captain, saw that the employees had not yet returned, so he made their beds for them and then went outside the village to pick them up.

Thousands of Miles to Deliver Cattle and Sheep

In order to thank the people of Tianjin for their support, which enabled their pears worth more than two million yuan to be transported out in time, the people of Qinglong County sent their cattle and sheep to supply the people of Tianjin. However, railway transportation was very tight and could not be transported all at once. Based on their past experience in herding cattle and sheep, grazing while walking, and walking thirty or forty *li* a day, which could also make the cattle and sheep gain weight, the commune decided to allocate some people, despite the tight labor force, to transport the cattle and sheep to Tianjin as soon as possible. Although the farmers had never been to Tianjin and did not know the way, they rushed to sign up, considering it the most glorious task to escort the cattle and sheep to Tianjin. Zhou Yuying, who had recently joined the fruit drying factory and firmly requested to escort the animals, said, "Without the support of the Tianjin comrades, our fruit drying factory would have stopped working long ago. I firmly request to escort the animals in order to express my gratitude to the people of Tianjin." In this way, ninety-five farmers, in six batches, transported four thousand five hundred and ninety sheep, one hundred and twenty-seven cattle, and fifty-five donkeys to Tianjin on foot in one month.

It was a very difficult task to transport cattle and sheep from Qinglong to Tianjin on foot. They trekked more than seven hundred *li* in the biting cold wind, climbed countless cliffs and mountains, passed many dangerous rapids, and spent eighteen or nineteen nights exposed to the wind and dew before arriving in Tianjin.

    梨从山里来
    本报记者  吕素瑄
    最近，天津市场上出售的水果当中，有几种过去罕见的白梨、波梨和酸梨，供应十分充足。这几种梨产自河北省青龙县，市民能够尝到它，这中间有着一段生动的城乡协作的故事。
    不能让梨烂在树上
    青龙县是个山区县，在方圆二百多里的县境内，满山遍布果树，以梨树最多。今年，预计可产一千多万斤，但是今年农村生产大跃进，劳动力、运输力紧张，摘梨的季节过了，大部分梨仍然挂在树上，摘下的一部分，因缺乏运输力，也无法运出去。天津市糖业果品公司知道这个情况后，立即组织职工讨论，提出水果收不起来运不出来怎么办？经过讨论，最后一致同意了组织职工下乡帮助人民公社采摘、收购。
    10月19日，由公司的支部书记带队，二百多个业务员、炊事员前去青龙县。运输部门还抽调了二十辆汽车参加运输。
    到达青龙的第二天早晨，天空还闪着星光，职工们就上山摘梨去了。因为摘梨需要一定的技术，所以一部分年青力壮的职工去参加炼钢、深翻地、秋收等劳动，替下农民来摘梨。大部分职工在树下分等包装，然后从山头上背到山下集中待运。
    这儿山高坡陡，人们从山顶向下看，驴子像只小绵羊，大人像五六岁的小孩，由山头到山下足有七八里。职工中没有一个人在山村生长过，有些人过去连高山也没有见过，第一次上山不由得心怵腿颤。为了在“小雪”前把梨抢摘干净，不让一个梨受冻，他们克服了困难，结果到11月22日“小雪”前一天，梨树上的梨子全摘光了。
    深山里第一次开进汽车
    密布山峦的青龙县，交通十分不便，只有一条由县人民委员会所在地通往滦县的公路。这里距离各主要产梨区，远的有一百多里，近的也有四五十里。汽车司机的驾驶技术虽然是很好的，但是过去并没有跑过山道。他们未来以前还以为是把梨由公路运到火车站，事后才知道全县仅有的二十辆汽车，全部投入钢铁运输战线上去了，农村运输力极端缺乏，无法把梨运到公路上来，需要他们设法把车开进去。汽车队长曹盛云以身作则首先驾驶着汽车到梨筐集中点去探道，不管山路如何崎岖，汽车能通过的他们就猛冲过去。像八道河、四拨子等地都是盘山道，由八道河到滦县车站需要经过三十六个弯道。横岭子存有二十多万斤梨，可就是山道难走，一边是悬崖，一边是山涧，大车在这儿都没法拐弯通过。汽车开到这儿，前轮眼看冲上山墙，后轮险些掉下山涧，司机在那儿拐弯需要二十多分钟，臂膀都累酸了，最后终于把几十万斤梨运出来了。遇到坎坷不平难于行走的山路和深水河沟时，公司职工和农民们就连夜修桥铺路。从崔庄子到横岭子一条三丈多长、用石头和树木铺成的便桥，五十多人一个夜间就修好了。就这样边走边修路，职工们和社员合作共修了六座便桥，整修了二十多里的道路，使汽车能够在这个公社的十六个集中点往来行驶。
    司机们日夜抢运、往返不空行。他们的被子就放在车箱里，经常在汽车上过夜。当他们把梨运到滦县车站后，随着就把在车站积压的工业品给捎进山去。在短短的第一周里，青龙县人民当前迫切需要的食盐、棉衣、棉布都抢运完了。
    亲如一家
    在曙光、火箭两个人民公社街道的墙壁上，贴满了红红绿绿的大字报，这是农民表扬职工们的大字报。在生活上，房东对这批新房客的照顾胜过家人。早上，职工起床前，冒着热气的洗脸水就已烧好了。晚上，不但喝的用的水准备好了，而且炕烧得暖烘烘的。职工们对农民的热诚招待过意不去，第二天一早，就悄悄地提前起床烧水、扫院子，但是第三天农民起得比职工更早。农民们还把自己储存的花生、栗子拿出来，晚上在大家回来团聚一起时炒给职工们吃。有一个夜间要变天，职工们都到山上盖梨筐去了。五十多岁的薛大队长十一点多回家后，看到职工们还没有回来，便替他们把被子铺好，然后又到村外去接他们。
    千里送牛羊
    青龙县的人民为了感激天津人民的支援，使他们的价值二百多万元的梨能够及时调运出去，便把自己的牛羊送来供应天津人民。但是铁路运输很紧张，一下运不到。他们根据自己过去赶运牛羊的经验，边走边牧放，每天走三四十里路，还能使牛羊长膘，公社便决定在劳力紧张的情况下，抽出一部分人来，把牛羊早日运到天津去。虽然农民们没有来过天津，更不认识路途，但是他们抢着报名，把能够押运牛羊到天津来，看作是最光荣的任务。最近才到果干厂参加生产的、坚决要求押运的周玉英说：“没有天津同志的支援，我们果干厂早就停工了。我坚决要求押运，是为了向天津人民表示我的心意。”就是这样，九十五个农民，分六批，在一个月里把四千五百九十只羊、一百二十七头牛和五十五头驴，徒步赶运到了天津。
    由青龙徒步把牛羊赶运到天津是件非常不容易的事情。他们在凛冽的寒风中跋涉了七百多里，攀登了无数的悬崖陟山，度过了好多条险峻的激流，餐风露宿地度过了十八九个夜晚，才来到天津。（附图片）
