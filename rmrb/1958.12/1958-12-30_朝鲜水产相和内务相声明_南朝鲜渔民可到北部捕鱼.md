Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 29th. The Minister of Fisheries of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Yu Chol-muk, and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Fang Xue-shi, today issued a joint statement, permitting South Korean fishermen to come to the northern territorial waters of Korea to fish.

The statement said that under the plunder of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, South Korean fisheries have been severely damaged, aquatic resources are on the verge of exhaustion, and the lives of fishermen are becoming increasingly miserable. Recently, South Korean fishermen, in order to find a way to survive, have entered the northern territorial waters of the Republic to fish illegally. After investigation, the Republic has determined that they are peaceful fishermen who came to fish and track schools of fish. Out of fraternal affection, the relevant authorities of the Republic not only gave these South Korean fishermen care and various conveniences, but also helped them return to their hometowns with their fishing boats and belongings.

The statement said that in order to care for and assist South Korean fishermen who are living in extreme hardship, the Ministry of Fisheries and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, under the instructions of the Republic's government, are permitting South Korean fishermen to come to a certain area of the northeastern coast of northern Korea during this year's pollack fishing season to fish in accordance with the regulations and procedures of the Republic's government. These regulations include that fishing is limited to the use of wooden boats, sailboats, or machine boats equipped with engines of 30 horsepower or less.

    新华社平壤29日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国水产相俞哲穆和内务相方学世今天发表联合声明，准许南朝鲜渔民到朝鲜北部领海内来捕鱼。
    声明说，南朝鲜在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的掠夺下，渔业遭到严重破坏，水产资源濒于枯竭，渔民生活日益悲惨。最近，南朝鲜渔民为了寻找生路，进入共和国北部领海非法捕鱼。共和国方面经过调查后判明，他们是为了捕鱼、追踪鱼群而来的和平渔民。共和国有关机关从同胞友爱出发，不仅对这些南朝鲜渔民给予关怀和各种方便，而且帮助他们带着他们的渔船和所携带的东西返回自己的家乡。
    声明说，为了照顾和援助生活极端困难的南朝鲜渔民，共和国水产省和内务省奉共和国政府的指示，准许南朝鲜渔民在今年明太鱼鱼汛期间，来朝鲜北部东海岸一定的区域，遵照共和国政府的规定和手续捕鱼。这些规定包括，捕鱼限于使用木船、帆船或设有三十马力以下的引擎的机器船。
