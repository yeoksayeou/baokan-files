    On Longevity
    Longevity is a matter of hope and concern for everyone.
    The most precious thing a person has is life, and life is only once for each person. The length of a person's life is not only related to each person's life and happiness, but also to the development of social productivity, the creation of material civilization, the strength of the country, and the prosperity of the nation.
    Whether or not a person can live a long life seems to be related only to hygiene and medicine, and to a person's wealth or poverty, but in the final analysis, it is determined by the nature of the social system.
                  Old Society:
            In a thousand villages, people leave excrement among the artemisia
            In ten thousand households, ghosts sing in desolation.
    It is precisely because the social system has a decisive influence on people's lifespan that in the old society ruled by reactionary classes, although the broad masses of working people also had the desire for longevity, this desire could not be realized at all. Even if a very few people lived relatively long lives, the vast majority of people had relatively short lives. According to statistics, before liberation, the average life expectancy of the Chinese people was only thirty years. At that time, the working people struggled on the verge of hunger and death all year round, living an extremely poor life of "not having enough to eat" and "not having enough clothes to wear." If they encountered serious natural disasters, large numbers of them were displaced and died of hunger and cold. At the same time, because the reactionary ruling class completely disregarded the life and death of the people, the working people lacked basic medical and health care conditions. Whenever epidemics broke out, tens of thousands of working people were deprived of their precious lives by "plague gods" and "disease demons." In 1932, cholera was prevalent in various parts of China, and the mortality rate of patients nationwide reached more than one-third. That year, the disease was prevalent in many parts of Anhui, and the masses called it "the great plague." When the epidemic was severe in Fuyang County, more than one hundred coffins were carried out every day, and more than one thousand people died in the city. One village lost four-fifths of its population, one family of ten died completely, and one family of eight died seven, leaving a three-year-old child unattended. The tragic scene at that time was described as "every family has the pain of a stiff corpse, every room has the sorrow of crying, some die behind closed doors, and some lose their entire family." Not only was this the case during epidemics, but even in ordinary years, various endemic diseases were extremely harmful to people's health and had high mortality rates. For example, schistosomiasis was prevalent in the areas along the Yangtze River in Anhui, and many "Lohan villages," "widow villages," and "uninhabited villages" appeared. It was truly "In a thousand villages, people leave excrement among the artemisia, in ten thousand households, ghosts sing in desolation." In the old society, the infant mortality rate in our country was also very high, some as high as two hundred per thousand or more. According to a survey in Sihong County in the early days of liberation, 1,313 women gave birth to a total of 6,942 children, of whom more than 2,220 died within one year of age. What an alarming number this is!
              Capitalist Countries:
        The rich indulge in debauchery and die young.
        The laborers eke out a living; how can they talk about longevity?
    Today's capitalist countries are no different from the old China ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries. On the one hand, the rich of the bourgeoisie live an extremely luxurious and debauched life; on the other hand, the broad masses of working people are on the verge of death, spending extremely painful years. Under the exploitation and oppression of the bourgeoisie, it is already very difficult for the broad masses of people to eke out a living, let alone talk about longevity. The bourgeoisie also talks about humanitarianism and seems to hope that mankind can live longer, but they would rather pour wheat into the sea than let the workers and peasants eat a full meal; they would rather use fine wine and delicacies to feast animals and establish insurance companies for pugs than allow unemployed workers and poor peasants to maintain the minimum standard of living. Although the science and culture of capitalist countries are relatively developed, these things have nothing to do with the working people. As Marx and Engels pointed out long ago: "The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers." Some time ago, the newspaper published the following example: In Santa Ana, USA, a poor woman begged thirty-four doctors to treat her child because she had no money, and all thirty-four doctors refused. The woman had no choice but to watch the disease take her child's life. This vivid example is a true reflection of bourgeois "civilization." The longevity that the bourgeoisie talks about is actually only the longevity of a small number of them, and their happiness is based on the hunger and death of the broad masses of working people. Not only can the working people not live long, but whether they can survive is still a serious problem facing them.
    In class society, not only can the working people not live long, but the "longevity like the Southern Mountain" that the exploiters themselves and the rulers themselves hope for cannot be achieved either. Although the reactionary ruling class can live a life of ease and comfort because they exploit and seize a large amount of the labor fruits of the working people, and at the same time enjoy extremely superior medical conditions, because they do not engage in labor all day long, their minds are empty, their spirits are decadent, and their lives are depraved, many of them die young.
            New China:
        People live longer, the land produces more grain,
        Men, women, old and young are all happy.
    In the era when the working people are masters of their own affairs, the situation is completely different. In our new China, class oppression and class exploitation have been eliminated, the poverty of the people's lives has gradually become a historical relic, social productivity is constantly developing, and the people's lives are constantly improving. Especially after the all-round socialist great leap forward this year and the universal realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, many places have implemented a food supply system where meals do not cost money, and the lives of the broad masses of people have been further improved. Our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always been concerned about the people's lives and health. In recent years, they have successively put forward great calls such as eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating endemic diseases. Under the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, the work of eliminating pests and diseases has formed a nationwide movement, and the sanitation conditions in urban and rural areas have undergone fundamental changes. The medical and health care undertakings have developed rapidly. Taking Anhui as an example, in the early days of liberation, it only received five dilapidated hospitals, twelve county health centers and health stations, one hundred and ninety beds, and two hundred and eleven medical personnel. In just a few years, it has developed to ninety-eight general hospitals and specialized hospitals, two thousand and six rural hospitals, and twelve thousand and four hundred health care rooms and maternity hospitals, with a total of more than sixty-three thousand and four hundred beds. Under this situation, whether in urban or rural areas, a new atmosphere of vitality and longevity is everywhere. The serious phenomenon of large-scale epidemics has basically disappeared; the incidence of various infectious diseases is getting smaller and smaller. In recent years, no cases of infectious diseases such as smallpox, cholera, and relapsing fever have been found in the province at all. The incidence of various diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, and encephalitis B has generally decreased; Kala-azar has been basically eliminated in the province. In the past two years alone, more than 300,000 patients with schistosomiasis have been cured, and fifteen counties have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Great achievements have been made in the prevention and control of other diseases such as filariasis, hookworm disease, tinea capitis, syphilis, and goiter. Xiaopeng Township in Tongcheng County is a township where schistosomiasis was very prevalent. Since liberation, schistosomiasis has been gradually eliminated, and the birth rate has increased from two per thousand to more than fifty per thousand, and the death rate has decreased from twelve point five per thousand to five per thousand. In the past four years, the newly added population has totaled one thousand two hundred and eighty-three people, and grain production has increased more than four times compared with before liberation. As a result, the economic outlook of the township and the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of people have undergone fundamental changes, and a thriving new atmosphere of "people live longer, the land produces more grain, and men, women, old and young are all happy" has emerged.
    The different situations in our country before and after liberation and the different situations between us and capitalist countries form an extremely strong contrast. From this, people can easily draw a conclusion: The issue of people's longevity is indeed an issue of medical and health conditions, but the most fundamental issue is the issue of the social system. Only in socialist countries is it truly possible to solve the longevity problem. In fact, in our socialist country, people do live longer than in the past, and they live healthier and more happily. At present, although the material and cultural living standards of our people are not yet high, we have every reason to say that in socialist New China, the preconditions for realizing longevity have been created for the broad masses of working people.
        Grasp the objective laws of life
        Longevity and eternal youth benefit society
    When we discuss the issue of longevity today, in addition to first clearly recognizing that the fundamental key to longevity lies in the social system, we must also thoroughly eliminate the various erroneous views of the exploiting classes on the issue of longevity.
        First of all, our understanding of longevity is fundamentally different from all the idealist viewpoints of the exploiting classes. The exploiting classes do not understand the objectivity of the laws of development of things. They believe that human life and death are the will of God and are predetermined by fate. "If the King of Hell wants you to die at the third watch, who dares to delay you until the fifth watch?" To achieve longevity and eternal youth, one must rely on heaven, Bodhisattva, or the blessings of Christ. This absurd idea is fundamentally incompatible with science. Contrary to the exploiting classes, we believe that human life, like everything else in the world, is a process of occurrence, development, and demise, which is independent of people's will. However, when we understand the laws of human physiology and the laws of disease occurrence, we can use these laws to prevent diseases, protect and promote health, and make people's lives longer than they are now. According to scientific research, the lifespan of animals is related to the growth period to a certain extent, and the lifespan is about five to six times the growth period. People generally do not mature until the age of twenty-five, so the human lifespan should generally be around one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fifty years. At present, the average lifespan of people in the world is far from reaching this standard. From this, we can conclude that although people are born and die, and everyone's life will eventually end, the lifespan of mankind can be extended. We should give full play to the superior conditions of the socialist system so that the broad masses of people can generally achieve health and longevity.
    Second, on the issue of the purpose of longevity, our views are fundamentally different from those of the exploiting classes. The exploiting classes believe that the purpose of life is to enjoy personal pleasure in everything. Their philosophy of life is "Heaven and earth will destroy those who do not act for themselves." Therefore, everything they do is for the insatiable pursuit of personal goals, and all their actions revolve around money, power, and status, cruelly oppressing and exploiting the working people, and even using the latest scientific and technological achievements as tools to oppress, exploit, and invade others. Contrary to the exploiting classes, we believe that people should not only live long and happily, but also live meaningfully. We are collectivists, and "everything for the collective" is our purpose in life and a fundamental principle for everyone to deal with problems. We live in the world to benefit society, benefit mankind, benefit our future generations, and make contributions to the cause of socialism and communism. It is precisely because we have such a lofty purpose in life that many revolutionary martyrs, although they know that human life is precious, are willing to sacrifice their personal lives for the liberation of all mankind and for the happiness of future generations. Whether on the battlefield or in the enemy's court and execution ground, they can regard death as going home. This noble character is something that all exploiting classes cannot understand at all.
        Participate in physical labor and exercise
        Turn medicine pots into iron eggs
    Third, on the method of achieving longevity, we are also fundamentally different from the exploiting classes. The exploiting classes have always despised labor, and they regard labor as a "lowly" thing. They believe that eating their fill all day long without engaging in labor can prolong life, and they regard food nutrition and tonic medicines as the fundamental means of longevity. Contrary to the exploiting classes, we believe that labor created the world and also created mankind itself. Leaving aside the political reaction of this idea of ​​despising labor, it is completely wrong even from the perspective of health and longevity. Normal physical labor can not only enhance the brain cortex's ability to analyze and judge stimuli and strengthen the brain cortex's ability to control muscles and various internal organs, but also promote blood circulation and promote systemic metabolism, which is of great benefit to people's health. Lenin once pointed out that "Labor is the natural need of a healthy body." In our country, with the development of the revolutionary and construction cause and the improvement of the people's awareness, love of labor has become the fashion of the new society. After the rectification movement, the broad masses of cadres and intellectuals enthusiastically participated in physical labor. In the crucible of labor, many people not only tempered their thoughts and learned production knowledge, but also exercised their physique. The teachers and students of Bengbu No. 3 Middle School have greatly enhanced their physical fitness and rapidly reduced the incidence of diseases after generally participating in physical labor. Some people who were originally known as "medicine pots" have now become "iron eggs." These facts also illustrate the role of labor in physical health. Naturally, we do not ignore the role of nutrition, and we are doing our best to improve nutritional conditions, but in comparison, labor exercise and sports activities are undoubtedly more important aspects.
        Combine popularization with improvement
        Mobilize the masses to pay attention to hygiene
    Fourth, on the issue of popularization and improvement of medical and health undertakings, there is a principled difference between us and bourgeois experts. In the eyes of bourgeois experts, medical and health undertakings only need to be improved, not popularized, and can only follow the expert line, not the mass line. Therefore, they hold a resistant attitude towards the major measures advocated by the Party to solve the prevention and treatment of the most harmful diseases for the majority of working people, such as the movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene, the movement to eliminate endemic diseases, and the popularization of rural medical networks. Contrary to bourgeois experts, we believe that popularization and improvement cannot be separated. Medical and health work must be popularized and improved at the same time. Only by rapid popularization can the problem of medical and health conditions for the masses be solved and a broad foundation be laid for the improvement of medicine. On the other hand, the popularization of medicine and health must be carried out under the guidance of improvement. Only in this way can the level of medical and health work be continuously improved and greater achievements be made. Popularization and improvement complement each other and cannot be neglected. We must not only carry out the prevention and treatment of diseases that are most harmful to the broad masses of people, but also study cutting-edge science in medicine. And the research of cutting-edge science is also for the broad masses of people, not just for a few rich people or rulers like bourgeois experts. That kind of view that only emphasizes improvement but not popularization is essentially indifferent to the health and longevity of the majority of people and lacks a mass perspective. As for the working methods of medicine and health, like other undertakings of the Party, it can not only follow the mass line, but also must follow the mass line. Not only should the movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene be carried out on a large scale by the masses, but also medical research work can be carried out on a large scale by the masses. Only when every medical worker can combine their own business, devote themselves to the mass movement, and actively participate in disease prevention and control and scientific research work can better results be achieved. This truth has been proven by countless facts, and any doubt is unfounded.
        Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine learn from each other
        Create a new medicine for China
    Fifth, on the issue of the development path of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine and medical science, there is also a fundamental difference between us and bourgeois medical "authorities." Bourgeois medical "authorities" believe that traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine are "unscientific" and that traditional Chinese medicine doctors are "guessing," like "the rooster crows and it dawns, and it dawns even if the rooster doesn't crow." They completely deny the role of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine. Contrary to the bourgeois "authorities," we believe that traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine have made extremely brilliant contributions to the development and prosperity of our great nation, and they also shoulder extremely important responsibilities in the current medical and health work. It is impossible to imagine that without the joint efforts of the broad masses of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine workers, China's health undertakings could have such great achievements today. Facts have proved that the role of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine is very obvious, and it is a major event related to the health and longevity of the people of the whole country, which must not be "taken lightly." This is as pointed out in the recent instructions of the Party Central Committee: "Traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine is a summary of the experience of the Chinese people in fighting against diseases for thousands of years. It contains the rich experience and theoretical knowledge of the Chinese people in fighting against diseases. It is a great treasure house, and we must continue to work hard to explore and improve it." Therefore, we must systematically organize Western medicine doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine, and widely organize traditional Chinese medicine doctors to take apprentices, so that the academic experience of traditional Chinese medicine can be completely passed down, and the medicine of the motherland can shine brightly. Naturally, our advocacy of carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine does not mean negating the achievements of Western medicine, nor does it mean that Western medicine cannot develop, let alone that traditional Chinese medicine is complete and flawless, but rather that traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine should be combined with each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, so as to achieve the confluence of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine and form China's new medicine, so that China's medicine can quickly catch up with and surpass the world's most advanced level, and make great contributions to ensuring people's health and longevity.
    Our motherland is in a great era of "one day equals twenty years." The people of the whole country are going all out, striving for the top, and accelerating socialist construction, and are creating conditions for gradually transitioning to communism. It can be imagined that in the near future, with the greater development of production and the further improvement of people's lives, with the popularization and improvement of medical and health undertakings, all diseases that endanger people's health will disappear or be restricted, and our motherland will become a country of longevity where youth stays forever. The saying that "seventy years old is rare in life" will be replaced by "it is not uncommon for people to live to be a hundred years old," and the long-cherished wish of the broad masses of working people for longevity will be universally realized. This is not a romantic fantasy, and history will prove that this will be a reality in the world.

    论长寿
    桂林栖
    长寿，是人人希望，人人关心的问题。
    人最宝贵的东西是生命，生命对于人们只有一次。人的寿命长短，不仅关系着每个人的生活与幸福，而且关系着社会生产力的发展，物质文明的创造，国家的强盛和民族的繁荣。
    人能不能长寿，乍看起来，只是与卫生医药有关，与人的富贵贫贱有关，其实归根结底，还是决定于什么性质的社会制度。
              旧社会：
        千村薜苈人遗矢
        万户萧疏鬼唱歌
    正因为社会制度对人的寿命有着决定性的影响，所以在反动阶级统治的旧社会里，广大劳动人民虽然也有着长寿的愿望，可是这个愿望根本无法实现，即使有极少数人寿命比较长些，但绝大多数人的寿命是比较短的。根据统计资料，解放前，我国人民的平均寿命只有三十岁。那时，劳动人民终年挣扎在饥饿和死亡线上，过着“食不果腹”、“衣不蔽体”的极端贫困的生活，如果遇到严重的自然灾害，更是大批流离失所，死于饥寒交迫之中。同时，由于反动统治阶级根本不顾人民的死活，劳动人民缺乏起码的医药保健条件，每当疫病流行的时候，就有成千成万的劳动人民被“瘟神”和“病魔”夺去了宝贵的生命。1932年，我国各地流行霍乱，全国患者的死亡率竟达到三分之一以上。那一年安徽很多地方流行此病，群众称之为“大家瘟”。阜阳县城疫情严重时，每天要抬出一百多口棺材，全城共死去一千多人。有一个村庄死去五分之四的人口，有一家十口完全死光，有一家八口死了七口，剩下一个三岁娃娃无人过问。当时的凄惨情景，有人描写为“家家有僵尸之痛，室室有哭泣之哀，或阁门而殪，或举族而丧”。不仅疫病流行期间如此，即使在一般年代里，各种地方病对人民的身体健康也危害极大，死亡率很高。例如血吸虫病在安徽的沿江地区流行，曾经出现了许多“罗汉村”、“寡妇村”、“无人村”，真是“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌。”在旧社会，我国婴儿的死亡率也是很高的，有的高达千分之二百以上。据解放初期在泗洪县的调查，一千三百一十三个妇女，共生育六千九百四十二个孩子，在周岁以内死亡的即达二千二百二十多个，这是一个多么惊人的数字！
          资本主义国家：
    富豪们荒淫无耻，不寿而终
    劳动者苟延残喘，谈何长寿
    今天的资本主义国家，和国民党反动派统治下的旧中国比较起来，并没有什么不同。一方面资产阶级的富豪们过着穷极奢侈、荒淫无耻的生活；一方面广大劳动群众却处在死亡的边缘，度着极其痛苦的岁月。在资产阶级的剥削和压迫之下，广大人民能够苟延残喘已经很不容易，更不用说什么长寿了。资产阶级口头也讲什么人道主义，似乎也希望人类能够益寿延年，但他们宁肯把小麦倒在大海里去，也不愿意让工农群众吃一餐饱饭；宁可用美酒佳肴来大宴禽兽，为叭儿狗大办保险公司，也不愿意让失业工人和贫苦农民能够维持最低限度的生活。尽管资本主义国家的科学文化比较发达，但这些东西和劳动人民根本无缘，正如马克思、恩格斯早已指出的那样：“资产阶级取消了以前认为可敬的、被诚惶诚恐地崇拜的一切行为底神圣的威严，它把医生、律师、诗人、科学家变成自己出钱雇佣的奴仆。”前些日子，报纸上曾经登载过这样一个例子：在美国的桑克他·安娜城内，有一个贫苦妇女曾经恳求三十四个医生给她的小孩治病，因为她没有钱，这三十四个医生都拒绝了。这个妇女无可奈何，眼睁睁地让病魔夺去了她的孩子的生命。这个活生生的例子，就是对资产阶级“文明”的真实写照。资产阶级所说的长寿，实际上只是他们一小撮人的长寿，他们的幸福是建立在广大劳动人民的饥饿和死亡的基础之上的；劳动人民不仅根本不能长寿，而且能不能活下去还是一个摆在面前的严重问题。
    在阶级社会里，不仅劳动人民不能长寿，就是剥削者本身和统治者本身所希望的“寿比南山”也是不能实现的。反动统治阶级虽然由于他们剥削和强占了劳动人民的大量劳动果实，可以过着养尊处优的生活，同时又享受着极为优越的医药条件，但是由于他们终日不事劳动，思想空虚，精神颓废，生活糜烂，因而他们中间很多人都是不寿而终。
            新中国：
        人增寿，地增粮，
        男女老少喜洋洋
    在劳动人民自己当家作主的时代，情况完全不同了。在我们新中国，已经消灭了阶级压迫和阶级剥削，人民生活的贫困已经逐渐成为历史陈迹，社会生产力不断向前发展，人民的生活不断得到提高。特别是在今年社会主义全面大跃进和全国农村普遍实现人民公社化以后，很多地方已经实行了吃饭不要钱的粮食供给制，广大人民的生活更有了进一步的改善。我们党中央和毛主席从来都是关心人民生活、关心人民健康的，近几年来，曾先后提出了除四害讲卫生、消灭地方病等伟大号召。在党和毛主席的号召下，除害灭病工作形成了全民性的运动，城乡卫生状况起了根本性的变化，医疗卫生事业一日千里地向前发展。以安徽来说，解放初期仅仅接收了五所破破烂烂的医院、十二所县卫生院和卫生所、一百九十张病床和二百一十一个医务人员，在短短的几年中，就发展到九十八所综合医院和专科医院，二千零六所乡村医院，一万二千四百所保健室和妇产院，共有病床六万三千四百多张。在这一情况下，无论城镇或农村，到处呈现着生气勃勃，人寿年丰的新气象。疫病大流行的严重现象，已经基本上没有了；各种传染病的发病率愈来愈小，近年来全省根本没有发现天花、霍乱、回归热等传染病例，伤寒、痢疾、乙型脑炎等各种疾病率普遍下降；黑热病在全省范围内已基本被消灭，血吸虫病患者仅两年来已治好的即达三十余万人，并有十五个县基本上消灭了血吸虫病，其他如血丝虫病、钩虫病、头癣、梅毒和甲状腺肿等疾病的防治工作都取得了很大的成效；桐城县晓棚乡是一个血吸虫病流行十分严重的乡，解放以来，逐步消灭了血吸虫病，人口的出生率由千分之二增加到千分之五十以上，死亡率由千分之十二点五降低到千分之五，四年来新增加的人口计一千二百八十三人，粮食生产比解放前增加了四倍以上，由此，全乡的经济面貌和广大人民的精神面貌都起了根本的变化，出现了“人增寿，地增粮，男女老少喜洋洋”的欣欣向荣的新气象。
    我国解放前后的不同情况、我们与资本主义国家的不同情况，形成了一个极其强烈的对比，从这里，人们不难得出一个结论：人们的长寿问题，固然是医药卫生条件问题，但是最根本的还是社会制度的问题。只有在社会主义国家，长寿问题才真正有了解决的可能，事实上，在我们的社会主义国家里，人们也确实比过去生活得更长，而且生活得更加健康，更加美满。在目前，我国人民的物质文化生活水平虽然还不够高，但是我们完全有充分理由这样说，在社会主义新中国，已经为广大劳动人民创造了实现长寿的先决条件。
      掌握生命的客观规律
      长寿永年为社会造福
    在我们今天讨论长寿问题的时候，除了必须首先明确认识长寿的根本关键在于社会制度以外，还必须彻底肃清剥削阶级在长寿问题上的各种错误观点。
      首先，我们所理解的长寿，和一切剥削
  阶级的唯心主义观点是根本不同的。剥削
  阶级不懂事物发展规律的客观性，他们认为人的生死是上帝的意旨，是命中注定，“阎王要你三更死，谁敢拖延到五更”，要长寿永年，就必须靠天，靠菩萨，靠基督的保佑。这种荒谬的思想，是与科学根本不相容的。与剥削阶级相反，我们认为，人的生命和世界上一切事物一样，也是一个发生、发展和消亡的过程，是不以人们意志为转移的。但是，当我们认识到人的生理规律和疾病发生的规律以后，却可以运用这些规律，防止疾病，保护和促进健康，使人们的寿命活得比现在更长。据科学研究，动物的生命期与生长期有一定的关系，生命期约为生长期的五倍至六倍。人一般要到二十五岁才能发育成熟，因此人的寿命一般应有一百二十五岁至一百五十岁左右。而目前世界上一般人的寿命远没有达到这个标准。从这里我们可以断定，人虽然有生有死，每个人的生命迟早总要结束，但人类的寿命，却是可以延长的。我们应该充分发挥社会主义制度的优越条件，使广大人民普遍地达到健康和长寿。
    第二，在长寿的目的问题上，我们与剥削阶级的观点根本不同。剥削阶级认为人生的目的，就是一切为了个人享乐，他们的人生哲学，就是“人不为己，天诛地灭”，所以他们一切都是为了贪得无厌的追求个人目的，一切行径都是环绕着金钱、权力和地位，残酷地压迫和剥削劳动人民，甚至利用最新的科学技术成就来作为压迫、剥削与侵略别人的工具。与剥削阶级相反，我们认为，人不仅要活得长，活得愉快，而且要活得有意义。我们是集体主义者，“一切为了集体”，这就是我们的人生目的，也是我们每个人处理问题的一项根本原则。我们生活在世界上，就为了有益于社会，有益于人类，有益于我们的后代子孙，对社会主义、共产主义事业有所贡献。正因为我们具有如此崇高的人生目的，所以许多革命先烈虽然知道人的生命是宝贵的，但为了全人类的解放，为了子孙万代的幸福，根本不惜牺牲个人的生命，无论在战场上或在敌人的法庭上和刑场上都能视死如归，这种高尚的品德，是一切剥削阶级所根本不能理解的。
      参加体力劳动锻炼
      药罐子变成铁蛋子
    第三，在实现长寿的方法上，我们和剥削阶级也是根本不同的。历来的剥削阶级都是鄙视劳动的，他们把劳动看成“下贱”的事情。他们以为饱食终日，不事劳动，就能够延年益寿，并且把食物营养和滋补药品当作长寿的根本手段。与剥削阶级相反，我们认为，劳动创造了世界，也创造了人类本身。我们姑且撇开鄙视劳动这种思想在政治上的反动性，就是单纯从健康长寿的角度来说，也是完全错误的。正常的体力劳动不仅能够增进大脑皮层对刺激的分析判断能力，加强大脑皮层对肌肉和各种内脏器官的控制能力，而且还能够促进血液循环，促进全身的新陈代谢，这对于人们的身体健康具有莫大的好处。列宁曾经指出，“劳动是健康的身体的自然需要。”在我国，随着革命和建设事业的发展，人民群众觉悟的提高，热爱劳动已经成为新社会的风尚。经过整风运动以后，广大干部和知识分子热烈参加体力劳动，在劳动的洪炉中，许多人不仅仅锻炼了思想，学到了生产知识，而且也锻炼了体格。蚌埠三中的师生，在普遍参加体力劳动以后，体质大大增强，疾病的发病率迅速下降，有些原来号称“药罐子”的人，现在变成了“铁蛋子”。这些事实，也都说明了劳动对于身体健康的作用。自然，我们并不忽略营养的作用，我们正在尽最大努力改善营养条件，但是比较起来，劳动锻炼和体育活动无疑是更为重要的方面。
        普及提高相结合
        发动群众讲卫生
    第四，在医药卫生事业普及与提高的问题上，我们与资产阶级专家之间存在着原则的分歧。在资产阶级专家看来，医药卫生事业只需要提高，不需要普及，只能走专家路线，不能走群众路线。因此他们对党所提倡的为大多数劳动人民解决危害最大的疾病防治问题，如除四害讲卫生、消灭地方病运动，普及乡村医疗网等等重大措施，都抱着抵触情绪。与资产阶级专家相反，我们认为，普及与提高是不能分开的，医药卫生工作必须是一面普及，一面提高，只有迅速地普及，才能解决群众的医疗卫生条件问题，才能为医学的提高打下广泛的基础。另一方面，医药卫生的普及，也必须在提高的指导下进行，只有这样，才能不断提高医药卫生工作的水平，取得更大的成就。普及与提高二者相辅相成，不可偏废。我们既要开展对于广大人民危害最大的疾病的防治，又要研究医学上的尖端科学，而研究尖端也是为了广大群众，不是像资产阶级专家那样只是为了少数富豪或统治者。那种只要提高，不要普及的观点，实质上是对于大多数人的健康长寿漠不关心，是缺乏群众观点的表现。至于医药卫生的工作方法，和党的其他事业一样，不仅可以走群众路线，而且必须走群众路线。不但除四害讲卫生要大搞群众运动，就是医学研究工作也可以大搞群众运动。只有使每个医务工作者能够结合本身的业务，投身于群众运动之中，积极参加疾病的防治和科学研究工作，才能收到更好的效果。这个道理，已经为无数事实所证明，任何怀疑都是没有根据的。
      中医西医互相学习
      创造中国的新医学
    第五，在中医中药和医药科学发展道路的问题上，我们与资产阶级医药“权威”之间也是有根本分歧的。资产阶级的医药“权威”认为，中医中药是“不科学”的，认为中医看病是“碰”的，好比“鸡叫也天亮，鸡不叫也天亮”，他们完全否定了中医中药的作用。与资产阶级“权威”相反，我们认为，中医中药对于我们伟大民族的发展和繁荣，作出了极其光辉的贡献，在当前医药卫生工作中，它也担负着极其重大的责任。不可能设想，没有广大中医中药工作者的共同努力，我国的卫生事业能够有今天这样巨大的成就。事实证明，中医中药的作用是非常明显的，它是关系到全国人民的健康和长寿的大事，决不可“等闲视之”。这正如党中央最近一次指示中所指出的：“中医中药学是我国人民几千年来同疾病作斗争的经验总结。它包含着中国人民同疾病作斗争的丰富经验和理论知识，它是一个伟大的宝库，必须继续努力发掘，加以提高。”因此，我们必须有计划地组织西医学习中医，广泛地组织中医带徒弟，使中医的学术经验能够完整地传授下来，使祖国的医学大放光彩。自然，我们主张发扬祖国医学遗产，并不意味着否定西医的成就，也不意味着西医不能发展，更不是说中医就完整无缺，而是主张中西医互相结合起来，互相学习，取长补短，做到中西医合流，形成中国的新医学，从而使我国的医学迅速地赶上和超过世界上最先进的水平，在保证人民健康、长寿上做出巨大的贡献。
    我们的祖国正处在“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代，全国人民正在鼓足干劲，力争上游，加速进行社会主义建设，并且为逐步过渡到共产主义创造条件。可以设想，在不久的将来，随着生产的更大发展和人民生活的进一步改善，随着医药卫生事业的普及和提高，一切危害人民身体健康的疾病将绝迹或者受到限制，我们祖国将成为青春长在的长寿之国。“人生七十古来稀”的说法将为“人活百岁不稀奇”所代替，广大劳动人民的长寿愿望将普遍实现。这不是浪漫主义的幻想，历史将证明这会是人间的现实。
