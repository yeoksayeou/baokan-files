Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Vice Premier Chen Yi, at a banquet tonight welcoming the delegation from the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, sternly condemned Dulles' recent shameless provocation of discord between socialist countries and nationalist countries' friendly cooperation, and refuted Dulles' and Tito's shameless slander against our people's commune movement.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi declared: "Whether it is Dulles or Tito, all their curses are in vain. No force in the world can stop the victorious advance of the 650 million Chinese people, and no force in the world can stop the continued upsurge of the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is very afraid of the friendly cooperation between socialist countries and nationalist countries. In order to undermine this friendly cooperation, they are doing everything possible to provoke discord. Not long ago, Dulles said that international communism had identified newly established countries as 'special sacrificial objects.' He accused socialist countries of encouraging nationalism, poisoning relations between newly independent countries and the West, and subverting the governments of these countries. Yes, we socialist countries have never concealed our just position of encouraging national independence movements. We fully support the heroic struggle of all oppressed nations for independence and freedom until they completely shatter the colonial chains imposed on them. As for the relations between the West and nationalist countries, there is no need for us to poison them. Such relations were never pleasant to begin with. It is the Western imperialist countries themselves, not the socialist countries, that poisoned these relations. Can we expect the relations between Britain and France and the young Republic of Egypt not to be poisoned when they launched an unprovoked attack? And it is none other than the United States itself that is carrying out extensive subversive activities against nationalist countries. If Dulles has forgotten how the agents under his command subverted the Republic of Indonesia, the Indonesian people will not forget it, and the people of Asia and Africa will not forget it. Socialist countries have stepped forward at every critical moment of serious struggle to support Asian and African nationalist countries and have established friendly relations of peaceful coexistence with these countries. This is a living fact that no one can change. It is precisely U.S. imperialism, attempting to replace Britain and France, that regards the Asian and African regions as a 'vacuum' and identifies Asian and African nationalist countries as 'special sacrificial objects.'"

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out: "The existence and development of the socialist camp is the most serious obstacle to imperialism's continued enslavement of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples. Faced with the fact of the rapid economic progress of socialist countries, imperialism cannot but admit that the speed of socialist economic development has greatly exceeded theirs. However, they slander the high tide of socialist economy as being caused by forced labor. This is the old tune they have been singing for decades. In the recent period, the situation is probably a bit unfavorable, and Dulles has repeatedly repeated this old tune. He has particularly focused his attack on our country's people's commune movement. He said that we are imposing a 'backward large-scale slave system called communes on the 650 million Chinese people,' saying that our communes have abolished individual freedom and family life; and in order to overcome the difficulties in realizing this plan, we have launched a vicious anti-American movement. It is true that the Chinese people hate U.S. imperialism, and as long as the United States does not stop its aggression against Chinese territory and its hostility towards the Chinese people, the Chinese people will continue to hate U.S. imperialism. However, the Chinese people have always strictly distinguished between the American people and the imperialist policies of the American government, and have always expressed friendship towards the American people. As for the people's commune movement that the Chinese people are enthusiastically carrying out, it is for the purpose of organizing on a larger scale to march toward nature, and for the purpose of realizing a happy tomorrow, engaging in selfless labor, which is precisely the embodiment of the free will of the liberated Chinese people. The people's commune did destroy the feudal patriarchal system that has been passed down for thousands of years, but it established a democratic and united family. The people's commune did more thoroughly eliminate the freedom of a minority to exploit the majority, but it facilitated the development of socialist cause and the liberation of human individuality. The people's commune makes it possible for us to create a political situation throughout the country that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and personally happy, lively and vigorous. Of course, it is unnecessary and impossible for Dulles to understand the people's commune. On the contrary, his fierce attack precisely proves that our people's commune movement is very good and very correct."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Dulles attacks us from the right, saying that our system is not as good as capitalism; Tito attacks us from the 'left,' saying that our people's communes are 'military communes' and 'have little in common with the Marxist concept of socialist construction.' The broad masses of Chinese peasants understand that in order to act faster, more disciplined and efficient in labor, and easier to mobilize, they must be militarized in organization like industrial workers. Marx and Engels proposed the program of 'forming an industrial army, especially in agriculture' in the 'Communist Manifesto' long ago. The Tito clique, which flaunts Marxism but is actually keen on revising Marxism, deliberately distorts our people's communes and can only expose their true colors. As for the '全民皆兵' (everyone a soldier) movement, this is because there is still imperialism in the world, and U.S. imperialism is still continuing to invade us. In order to deal with imperialism, the 全民皆兵 movement has arisen accordingly, which is not surprising and is a logical necessity. Of course, the Tito clique, which puts powder on the face of the capitalist system, wags its tail to the dollar, corrupts the people's revolutionary will, and serves imperialism, cannot but deeply hate this. Whether it is Dulles or Tito, all their curses are in vain. No force in the world can stop the victorious advance of the 650 million Chinese people, and no force in the world can stop the continued upsurge of the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

### 陈毅副总理严厉谴责杜勒斯和铁托  我国人民公社运动非常好  从右从“左”咒诅都枉费心机  把亚非民族主义国家当作“特别牺牲品”的恰是美帝国主义

    陈毅副总理严厉谴责杜勒斯和铁托
    我国人民公社运动非常好  从右从“左”咒诅都枉费心机
    把亚非民族主义国家当作“特别牺牲品”的恰是美帝国主义
    新华社7日讯  陈毅副总理今晚在欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的宴会上讲话时，严厉地谴责了杜勒斯最近对社会主义国家和民族主义国家之间的友好合作的无耻挑拨离间，驳斥了杜勒斯和铁托对我国人民公社运动的无耻污蔑。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中宣称：“杜勒斯也罢，铁托也罢，他们的一切咒诅都是枉费心机。世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡六亿五千万中国人民的胜利前进，世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的继续高涨。”
    陈毅副总理说：“帝国主义，特别是美国帝国主义，非常害怕社会主义国家和民族主义国家之间的友好合作。为了破坏这种友好合作，它们极尽挑拨离间的能事。前不久，杜勒斯说，国际共产主义已经把新成立的国家确定为‘特别的牺牲品’。他指责社会主义国家鼓励民族主义、毒化新独立的国家同西方之间的关系、颠复这些国家的政府。是的，我们社会主义国家从来不隐讳我们鼓励民族独立运动的正义立场，我们全力支持一切被压迫民族争取独立、自由的英勇斗争，直到他们完全粉碎强加在他们身上的殖民锁链为止。至于说到西方同民族主义国家之间的关系，那是用不着我们去毒化的，这种关系原来就不美妙，使得这种关系毒化的，是西方帝国主义国家自己，不是社会主义国家。英、法对年青的埃及共和国发动了无端的进攻，能够指望它们之间的关系不毒化吗？而对民族主义国家进行广泛的颠复活动的不是别人，正是美国自己。如果杜勒斯已经忘记了他手下的特务怎样颠复印度尼西亚共和国的话，印度尼西亚人民是不会忘记的，亚非人民是不会忘记的。社会主义国家在每一个严重的斗争关头挺身而出，支持亚非民族主义国家，并且同这些国家建立了和平共处的友好关系。这是活生生的事实，谁都改变不了的。把亚非地区当成‘真空’，把亚非民族主义国家确定为‘特别的牺牲品’的，恰恰是企图取英、法而代之的美国帝国主义。”
    陈毅副总理指出：“社会主义阵营的存在和发展是帝国主义继续奴役殖民地、半殖民地人民的最严重的障碍。面对着社会主义国家经济突飞猛进的事实，帝国主义也不能不承认社会主义经济发展的速度大大地超过了它们，但是，它们污蔑社会主义经济的高涨是强迫劳动造成的。这是它们唱了几十年的老调。在最近一个时期以来，大概情况有点不妙，杜勒斯一再重复这个老调，他特别集中攻击我国的人民公社运动。他说，我们正在把一种‘名字叫做公社的落后的大规模的奴隶制度强加在六亿五千万中国人民的头上’，说我们的公社取消了个人自由和家庭生活；而为了克服实现这个计划的困难，我们发动了一个恶毒的仇美运动。不错，中国人民是仇视美国帝国主义的，而且，只要一天美国不停止对中国领土的侵略和对中国人民的敌视，中国人民就要继续仇视美国帝国主义。但是，中国人民从来就是把美国人民和美国政府的帝国主义政策严格区分开来的，而且一向对美国人民表示友好。至于中国人民正在热烈开展的人民公社运动，那是为了在更大的规模上组织起来向大自然进军，为了实现幸福的明天，进行忘我的劳动，这正是解放了的中国人民的自由意志的体现。人民公社的确破坏了几千年传下来的封建家长制，但是建立了民主团结的家庭。人民公社的确更彻底地消灭了少数人剥削多数人的自由，但是，更便利于社会主义事业的发展，更便利于人类个性的解放。人民公社使我们有可能在全国范围内造成又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。当然，要杜勒斯了解人民公社，是不必要的，也是不可能的。相反，他的猛烈攻击，恰好证明我们的人民公社运动非常好，非常正确。”
    陈毅副总理说：“杜勒斯从右边来攻击我们，说我们的制度不如资本主义；铁托从‘左’边来攻击我们，说我们的人民公社是‘军事公社’，‘同马克思主义的社会主义建设观念没有多少共同之处’。中国的广大农民群众懂得，要在劳动中行动得更迅速，更有纪律和效率，更便于调动，他们就必须像产业工人一样，在组织上军事化。马克思和恩格斯早在‘共产党宣言’中就提出‘成立产业军，特别是在农业方面’的纲领。标榜马克思主义而实际上热中于修正马克思主义的铁托集团，故意歪曲我们的人民公社，只能暴露他们的真正面目。至于‘全民皆兵’运动，这是因为世界上还有帝国主义，美帝国主义还在继续侵略我们，为了对付帝国主义，相应地产生全民皆兵运动，这毫不奇怪，而且是逻辑的必然。当然，给资本主义制度搽粉，向美元摇尾乞怜，腐蚀人民革命意志，为帝国主义效劳的铁托集团，对此是不能不深恶痛绝的。杜勒斯也罢，铁托也罢，他们的一切咒诅都是枉费心机。世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡六亿五千万中国人民的胜利前进，世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的继续高涨。”
