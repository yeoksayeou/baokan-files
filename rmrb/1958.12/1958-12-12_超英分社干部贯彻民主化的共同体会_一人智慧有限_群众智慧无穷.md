    Common Experience of Super-Ying Branch Cadres in Implementing Democratization
    Individual Wisdom is Limited, Mass Wisdom is Infinite
    (Our Dispatch) The Super-Ying Branch of the People’s Commune in Shangcheng County, Henan Province, fully promotes democracy by using forms such as member representative meetings, old peasant forums, life meetings, and suggestion boxes to absorb members in the management of all commune affairs, promoting a great leap forward in various tasks.
    This branch attaches great importance to using various representative meetings to mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals. The management area has now held four member representative meetings, each large team has held a total of seventy-five representative meetings, each squadron has held a total of two hundred and eleven meetings, and factories and mines have held seventeen meetings. A total of 163,600 rationalization proposals have been put forward, and more than 75% of the proposals have achieved good results. For example, Yue Qingru, the director of the No. 9 Regiment Iron Factory, had an undemocratic work style and did not consult with the masses when encountering problems, so the output of iron was not high and the quality was not good. At the workers' representative meeting, everyone criticized him and put forward more than 1,500 rationalization proposals. Yue Qingru accepted the criticism and changed his style, and everyone's production enthusiasm was very high. The average work efficiency of the 87 people in the coal transportation team increased by nearly 100%.
    "Individual wisdom is limited, mass wisdom is infinite." This is the common feeling of cadres at all levels of the Super-Ying Branch after holding forums and listening to the opinions of the masses. The entire management area has held more than 500 large and small forums.
    In order to widely absorb the opinions of members and continuously improve work, the branch has also set up 210 suggestion boxes, and has collected more than 150,000 opinions, which have effectively promoted industrial and agricultural production. The Third Company of the First Battalion of the Second Regiment disbanded the manure collection team during the autumn harvest and autumn planting and the large-scale steel production, resulting in a lot of manure accumulating everywhere without anyone managing it. Commune member Zhang Jizhong wrote a suggestion about this matter and put it in the suggestion box. Battalion Commander Zeng Wenqing adopted this suggestion in a timely manner after seeing it, and the next day organized more than 1,000 people to make a concentrated effort to collect 1,276 dan of manure. The deputy battalion commander of the Fourth Battalion was responsible for managing the canteen. Because he did not manage it well, everyone only ate cold rice and cold steamed buns. After the members submitted critical opinions to the regimental suggestion box, the regiment promptly sent people to check and study improvement methods, and the problem was quickly resolved.
    Holding regular life meetings is an important democratic form of this branch. Out of the 443 companies in the entire branch, 247 companies insist on holding life meetings every ten days or half a month. Through the life meetings, the members praised 548 Party members, 1,005 Youth League members, and more than 1,500 cadres; and criticized more than 400 Party members, Youth League members, and cadres. Cadres praised more than 8,000 members and also criticized inactive members. Wu Dezhong, a cadre of the Seventh Regiment, did not go deep into his work and had an undemocratic style. After being criticized at the life meeting, he has now undergone a great change and has gone deep into the fields to lead production with production. Pan Guoming, a member of the First Battalion, originally did not work unless urged. After everyone criticized him at the life meeting, he has now become an active member who seeks out work.

    超英分社干部贯彻民主化的共同体会
    一人智慧有限  群众智慧无穷
    本报讯  河南商城县人民公社超英分社运用社员代表会、老农座谈会、生活会、意见箱等形式，充分发扬民主，吸收社员管理一切社务，推动了各种工作大跃进。
    这个分社非常重视运用各种代表会，发动群众提合理化建议。现在管理区已开社员代表会四次，各大队共开代表会七十五次，中队共开二百一十一次，厂矿开了十七次。共提合理化建议十六万三千六百多条，并有75％以上的建议收到良好效果。如九团铁厂厂长岳庆如工作作风不民主，遇事不和群众商量，铁的产量不高，质量不好。工人代表会上大家对他提出了批评意见，并提出合理化建议一千五百多条。岳庆如接受了批评，转变作风后，大家生产情绪十分高涨，运炭组八十七个人平均工作效率提高将近一倍。
    “一人智慧有限，群众智慧无穷”。这是超英分社各级干部通过召开座谈会，听取群众意见的共同感觉。全管理区召开各种大小座谈会已达五百多次。
    为了广泛地吸收社员意见，不断改进工作，分社还设立了二百一十个意见箱，并已收集意见达十五万多条，有力地促进了工农业生产。二团一营三连在秋收秋种和大办钢铁时，把拾粪组抽散了，结果到处积存了很多粪没人管理。社员张济中对这件事写了一个建议投到意见箱里，营长曾文清看到后及时采纳了这个意见，第二天就组织一千多人，突击拾粪一千二百七十六担。四营副营长负责管理食堂工作，由于他管理得不好，大家光吃冷饭冷馍，社员们向团部的意见箱里投了批评意见后，团部及时派人检查，研究改进办法，问题很快得到解决。
    定期召开生活会议，是这个分社的一个重要的民主形式。全分社共有四百四十三个连，坚持十天和半月过一次生活会的就有二百四十七个连，通过生活会，社员表扬了五百四十八名党员，一千零五名团员，一千五百多名干部；批评党员、团员和干部四百多人。干部表扬社员八千多人，对于不积极的社员也进行了批评。七团干部吴德中工作不深入，作风不民主，经过生活会的批评，现在大有转变，已经深入田间，以生产领导生产。一营社员潘国明原来不督促不干活，经过生活会上大家提出批评后，现在已变成了找活干的积极分子。（方徨）
