I am Zhang Lianfang, Deputy Director of the Satellite People's Commune in Weichang County, Hebei Province. Our commune is located in a sparsely populated, cold mountainous area, where the grain yield was only about one hundred jin per mu in the past. Last year, I attended the Four-Level Cadre Conference of the CPC Chengde Prefectural Committee and listened to the experience of the Secretary of the Camel Head Township Branch in our county on high-yield wheat. I was determined to respond to the Party's call for cadres to cultivate experimental fields. I wanted to create a high-yield wheat field with a yield of one thousand jin per mu in this cold area under Saihanba.

The plan for a yield of one thousand jin of wheat per mu spread, and the young people were all happy and said that it would definitely be achieved. However, conservative ideas were attacking us. Na Dianming, the captain of the Fifth Team, said, "We didn't even manage six hundred jin, and now we want to do a thousand jin, isn't this nonsense!" Some said, "Among us, old and young, no one has ever produced a thousand jin. Only this young girl, Zhang Lianfang, has." Some said, "This place is not like inside the pass, we can't achieve a thousand jin." The county and district leaders supported us, and District Committee Secretary Comrade Dong Rui came to discuss with me personally, which made us even stronger. I thought: I must make an example for them to see.

We first experimented in the youth team. This team had four hundred mu of land, and each mu needed 20,000 jin of manure fertilizer, requiring a total of eight million jin. At that time, there was still a shortage of six million jin. We started a "three diligences," "four heavens," and "ten great turnarounds" campaign to gather manure fertilizer in the frigid season of minus ten degrees Celsius. After fifteen days of hard work, we finally achieved the task of applying 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu.

Although we applied topdressing and processed the fertilizer many times, the wheat did not grow well, only a little over a foot tall. Those who originally believed that a thousand jin could not be achieved started to talk again. I thought: Could the plan for a thousand jin fail like this? I was not reconciled. I had to find a way. I went to visit the cadre wheat experimental field in Dage Town, Fengning County, and saw that the wheat was growing very well. They said: "We applied 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and also irrigated it with 2,700 jin of liquid manure." I felt that this experience was very good. After returning home, I discussed with the commune members to apply fertilizer heavily. Coincidentally, the supply and marketing cooperative brought us 1,500 jin of ammonium nitrate. After everyone applied ammonium nitrate, they irrigated it with liquid manure, applying fertilizer four times in five days. After six days, the wheat seedlings grew rapidly, lush and even. Everyone said it looked excellent. Jing Weiqing, who had been gossiping non-stop since the beginning of spring, admitted defeat for the first time. I also breathed a sigh of relief.

After the hard work of all the team members, their sweat was not shed in vain, and they achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The forty-four mu and six fen of wheat yielded an average of 609.7 jin per mu, of which 4.56 mu yielded 1,234.3 jin per mu, an increase of five to ten times compared to last year. In the past, this area did not grow corn at all. This year, the corn yield was 1,006 jin per mu. Liu Xin, the director of the cooperative who originally disagreed with the thousand-jin target, expressed his feelings with a poem: "The spring breeze does not blow, the flowers do not bloom, the trees are not planted, the fruits do not come, if it were not for the thousand-jin team, how could we have achieved today's success."

    保守派服输了
    河北省围场县卫星人民公社副社长  张莲芳
    我们卫星人民公社处在地广人稀的寒冷山区，过去亩产百十来斤粮。去年我参加了中共承德地委四级干部会议，听了我县骆驼头乡总支书记介绍的小麦丰产经验。我下定决心响应党提出的干部种试验田的号召。要在塞罕坝下这个寒冷地带创造亩产一千斤的小麦丰产田。
    亩产千斤小麦的计划传开后，青年们个个高兴说，一定能搞成。但保守思想却在向我们进攻。五队的队长那殿明说：“六百斤没搞成，又要搞千斤这不是胡闹！”有的说：“咱这有老有少，谁也没放出千斤这一炮。唯独黄毛丫头张莲芳放了出来。”有的说：“这地方不比关里，不能打千斤。”县、区领导上支持我们，区委书记董瑞同志亲自来和我商量，这使我们更坚强起来。我想：一定要作出个样子给他们看看。
    我们先在青年队试验，这个队有四百亩地，每亩施两万斤粪肥，需要八百万斤。当时还缺六百万斤。我们就在零下十几度的严寒季节，开始了“三勤”“四天”“十大翻身”的大战粪肥运动。苦战了十五天，终于达到亩施两万斤底粪的任务。
    虽然多次追肥加工，可是，麦子总是长不好，只有一尺多。原来认定不能实现千斤的人又在议论纷纷。我想：难道一千斤计划就这样落空了吗？不甘心。一定要想办法。我就去参观了丰宁县大阁镇干部小麦试验田，看到麦子长得很好。他们说：“亩施底肥一万斤，又灌了两千七百斤大粪汤子。”我感到这经验非常好。回家后，就和社员们商量要狠狠地描肥。碰巧供销社给我们拉来一千五百斤硝酸铵。大家描完硝酸铵，又灌了大粪汤子，五天描四遍肥。过了六天麦苗飞快地长起来了，葱绿刷齐。大家都说长的出色。入春以来说闲话没断的荆维清第一次服输了。我也松了一口气。
    经过全体队员的千辛万苦，没白流了汗，获得了历来未有的大丰收。四十四亩六分地小麦，平均亩产六百零九点七斤，其中有四点五六亩，亩产一千二百三十四点三斤，比去年增加五—十倍。过去我们这个地区根本不种包米，今年种的包米亩产一千零六斤。原来不同意搞一千斤的刘信社主任用一首诗来表达他的心意。“春风不吹花不开，树木不栽果不来，若非有了千斤队，哪得今天成就来。”
