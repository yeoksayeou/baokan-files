	How Much Oil Can Be Squeezed from Coal?
	A small power plant that consumes 5,200 tons of coal annually, if the coal is fully utilized in a comprehensive manner, can recover 54 tons of light diesel, 140 tons of heavy diesel, 34 tons of crude phenol, 3,147 tons of petroleum coke and semi-coke, 30 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer, and 10,000 cubic meters of high-quality gas. These products can be exchanged for almost 12,000 tons of coal. This shows that comprehensive utilization of coal and ash can not only greatly reduce power generation costs but also potentially recover the entire power generation cost from comprehensive utilization.

    煤里能挤多少油？
    一座每年耗用五千二百吨煤的小型电厂，如果把煤全部综合利用起来，便可从中收回轻柴油五十四吨，重柴油一百四十吨，粗酚三十四吨，石油焦和半焦三千一百四十七吨，硫铵肥料三十吨，高质煤气一万立方公尺。这些产品差不多可换回一万二千吨煤。这说明综合利用煤、灰，不仅可以大大降低发电成本，而且有可能将全部发电成本从综合利用中拿回来。
