    One Year of Production Surpasses Ten Years
    – The Experience of Comprehensive Production Leap Forward in Zhangshi Township, Qujiang County, Guangdong Province in 1958
    Yang Yongming, First Secretary of the CCP Zhangshi Commune Committee
    “High mountains and cold waters produce top scholars, one year of production surpasses ten years.” These are two folk songs sung by the people of Zhangshi Township celebrating the extraordinary harvest of 1958.
    Zhangshi Township is located in the southwestern mountainous area of Qujiang County, Guangdong. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant light of the General Line, its 19,800 people, after a year of hard work, achieved an extraordinary and comprehensive production harvest. The average per-mu yield of late rice in the township increased tenfold compared to last year. Adding the previous season's rice and miscellaneous grains, the total grain output for the year increased by 4 million jin more than the total grain output of the nine years since liberation. The yield of peanuts on 3,585 mu increased tenfold compared to last year. Other crops, animal husbandry, and aquaculture also increased by one to several times. Along with the unprecedented extraordinary agricultural harvest, the commune's industry also made a flying leap forward. It has completed 2,502 tons of pig iron and 249 tons of native steel, and built four small hydroelectric and thermal power stations, and 66 factories and mines such as fertilizer plants, iron smelters, and lime plants. A transportation network is gradually taking shape. Schistosomiasis, which seriously endangers people's health, has also been basically eliminated.
    Due to this year's comprehensive Great Leap Forward, Zhangshi Township's past impoverished state of "mountains and rivers exhausted, three meals not assured" has been transformed into a prosperous new village with abundant grains that cannot be eaten or used up.
    Why was Zhangshi Township able to achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward? The main reason is that we implemented the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production, based on putting politics in command, launching mass movements, and carrying out technological revolution, and vigorously developing industry, grain, and diversified operations. In April of this year, our township merged all 25 agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the township into a joint cooperative of one township and one cooperative. At that time, we did not understand that this was the prototype of the people's commune. Arranging production according to the principle of two simultaneous developments was not so clear at that time. We just felt that in 1956 our township focused on grain and neglected diversified operations, which was wrong; in 1957 we focused on diversified operations, but grain production did not meet the target, which was also wrong; this year we should focus on grain and comprehensively develop everything. After the establishment of the joint cooperative, it was very beneficial to the overall development of production in terms of unified production planning, labor arrangement, and unified fund allocation, so we just went ahead and did it. Later, after the provincial party committee summarized and read the central government's instructions, we realized that we were implementing the Party's production policy on the basis of the people's commune, and thus achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward.
    This year, grain income accounts for slightly more than half of the total annual income from industry, agriculture, and sideline occupations, and the rest comes from diversified operations and commune industry. There has been great development in diversified operations such as peanuts, sugarcane, cassava, ginger, shiitake mushrooms, tea, fruits, and melon seeds; there has been a great increase in pigs, chickens, geese, fish, and honey. On average, each household has more than three pigs, and each person has an average of ten chickens. There has also been great development in logging, with 50,000 cubic meters of timber harvested within half a year. In addition, we have increased and developed production departments such as coal mining, iron smelting, limestone mining, lime burning, brick and tile burning, refractory brick burning, firewood and charcoal burning, bamboo weaving, and transportation. We have achieved comprehensive development of industry and agriculture, and a Great Leap Forward on all fronts of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    Now our commune can completely achieve self-sufficiency in grain, oil, pork, chicken, fish, and vegetables, and we also have our own fruits, shiitake mushrooms, tea, honey, etc. However, we also realize that the socialist people's commune is not a self-sufficient feudal manor. We need to buy things from the state and other communes, and we also need to sell our own things to the state and other communes. Therefore, in 1958, in addition to carrying out a large amount of self-sufficient production, we also carried out a large amount of commodity production. About 40% of the total industrial and agricultural products are commodities. The state's grain purchase task for us is 4.6 million jin, and this year we overfulfilled it by nearly double. In diversified operations and industrial products, more than two-thirds are commodities. For example, of the 50,000 cubic meters of timber, only 3,000 cubic meters are for our own use, and the rest is sold to the state; sugarcane, ginger, shiitake mushrooms, tea, honey, melon seeds, iron, limestone, refractory bricks, etc. are all commodities; vegetables, pond fish, fruits, firewood and charcoal, coal, lime, bricks and tiles, etc. are also mostly sold externally; live pigs and peanut oil have also overfulfilled the task of external transfer. Because of this, our commune has a considerable amount of cash income. In addition to free meals, we have been paying wages on a monthly basis since September this year, and the cash deposited in the bank, including the working capital of the commune's commercial department, is 1.5 million yuan. We also have many materials in our warehouses, timber yards, and mines that can be exchanged for cash. This fully illustrates the importance of carrying out commodity production. Only by correctly combining self-sufficient production and commodity production can the commune economy truly become active.
    This year we have also vigorously developed industrial production, and have begun to achieve simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. This year, our commune's agricultural production is the main focus, with agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries accounting for more than 80% of the total income; industry was originally a blank sheet of paper, with nothing at all, and there was no preparation for developing industry. However, under the influence of the Great Leap Forward in industry in the second half of the year, the whole commune vigorously engaged in iron smelting, coal mining, limestone mining, lime burning, refractory brick burning, brick and tile burning, agricultural tool manufacturing and repair, plus some handicrafts, and industrial income also accounted for one-eighth of the total income of the whole commune. This year's industrial production is only a beginning. In the future, we can vigorously engage in agricultural product processing and agricultural tool, fertilizer, and pesticide manufacturing, vigorously engage in mining and iron smelting, vigorously engage in building materials, and vigorously engage in hydropower stations. Our commune has decided to gradually realize the industrialization of the commune according to the needs of the state and itself, and according to the principle of adapting to local conditions and using local materials.
    Now, looking back, why were we able to achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in production? I think the most important thing is that we resolutely implemented the General Line for building socialism put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The General Line educated and encouraged the people of the whole township, making them unwilling to be poor. The poorer the place, the more it wants to turn over, and the enthusiasm of the masses is particularly great. But having enthusiasm alone is not enough, there must also be a path. We felt that the original agricultural cooperative road was not wide enough, so we started a joint cooperative, which later developed into a people's commune. As soon as the people's commune was established, we gave full play to the superiority of the people's commune and comprehensively organized all industries such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, industry, and mining.
    Secondly, with determination and a path, it is also necessary to organize a team for a comprehensive leap forward. We divided the commune's production into five fronts: grain, forestry, industry, animal husbandry and aquaculture, and diversified operations. Each front was equipped with at least one Party committee secretary or cooperative director as commander, responsible for specialized management. Each front was equipped with a fixed basic labor force to form a professional team. During the most intense period of grain production, the entire commune always maintained 15% of the labor force to continue professional production that could not be interrupted; when grain production was relatively moderate, a large number of laborers were transferred to the most needed fronts. In this way, with specialization and collaboration, we guaranteed a leap forward on all fronts.
    Now our Zhangshi Township has merged with Wushi and Dakengkou townships to become a commune of 30,000 people. In order to better implement the production policy of the people's commune put forward by the Central Committee, we are prepared to further develop industry and diversified operations on the basis of continuing to increase the unit area yield of grain and ensuring total output. We are determined to strive for a greater victory next year under the correct leadership of the Party, together with all communes in the country! (Attached picture)

    一年生产胜十年
    ——广东省曲江县樟市乡1958年生产全面跃进的经验
    中共樟市公社党委第一书记  杨永明
    “山高水冷出状元，一年生产胜十年”。这是樟市乡人民歌唱1958年特大丰收的两句山歌。
    樟市乡处在广东曲江县西南部山区，全乡一万九千八百多人，在党的正确领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，经过一年的苦战，取得了全面生产的特大丰收。全乡晚稻平均亩产比去年增加十倍，加上上一季稻谷和杂粮等，全年粮食总产量比解放九年来粮食产量总和还增加四百万斤，花生三千五百八十五亩，单产比去年增加十倍。其他农作物、畜牧、养殖业也有一倍至几倍的增加。在农业空前特大丰收的同时，公社工业也在飞跃前进，生铁已完成二千五百零二吨、土钢完成二百四十九吨，建筑了小型水力、火力发电站四座，肥料厂、炼铁厂、石灰厂等厂矿六十六个。交通运输网正在逐步形成。严重危害人民健康的血吸虫病也已基本消灭。
    由于今年的全面大跃进，樟市乡过去“山穷水尽，三餐不饱”的贫苦面貌，已变为五谷丰收，吃不完，用不尽的富裕新村。
    樟市乡为什么能够实现全面大跃进呢？主要是由于我们在政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命的基础上贯彻执行了工业农业并举和自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，大力发展了工业、粮食和多种经营。我们乡在今年4月就把全乡二十五个农业社同手工业社以及乡的地方国营工矿等企业合并成一乡一社的联社。当时我们还不懂得这就是人民公社的雏型。按照两个并举的方针来安排生产，当时也不是那么明确的。只是觉得1956年我们乡抓了粮食，丢了多种经营，不对；1957年抓了多种经营，粮食生产又没有过关，也不对；今年应当以粮食为中心，全面大发展。而联社建成以后，无论在生产的统一规划、劳动力的安排和资金的统一调度方面，都对全面发展生产十分有利，因此就干起来了。直到后来，经过省委的总结，看了中央的指示，才知道我们是在人民公社的基础上贯彻执行了党的生产方针，因而获得了全面大跃进。
    今年粮食收入在全年工、农、副业总收入中所占的比重，约一半多一些，其余是多种经营和公社工业的收入。多种经营中的花生、甘蔗、木薯、生姜、冬菇、茶叶、水果、瓜子有很大发展；猪、鸡、鹅、鱼、蜂蜜，有很大增加，猪平均每户三头多，鸡平均每人有十只。林木采伐也有很大发展，半年之内就采伐了五万立方公尺的木材。此外，我们还增加了和发展了挖煤、炼铁、采石灰石、烧石灰、烧砖瓦、烧耐火砖、砍柴烧炭、编织竹器、搞运输业等生产部门。做到了工农业全面大发展，农林牧副渔全线大跃进。
    现在我们公社粮、油、猪肉、鸡、鱼、蔬菜完全可以自给，水果、冬菇、茶叶、蜜糖等等自己也有了。但是我们也认识到社会主义的人民公社不是自给自足的封建庄园，我们需要买国家和其他公社的东西，也需要把自己的东西卖给国家和其他公社。因此，在1958年我们除了大量进行自给性的生产外，还大量进行了商品生产。在工农总产品中大约有40％左右是商品。国家规定我们的购粮任务是四百六十万斤，今年我们超额将近一倍完成了。在多种经营和工业产品中，更有三分之二以上是商品。例如五万立方公尺的木材，我们自用的只有三千立方公尺，其余全部卖给国家；甘蔗、生姜、冬菇、茶叶、蜂蜜、瓜子、铁、石灰石、耐火砖等全部是商品；蔬菜、塘鱼、水果、柴炭、煤、石灰、砖瓦等也多半是外卖的；生猪、花生油也超额完成了外调任务。正因如此，我们公社的现款收入相当多。除了伙食不要钱外，自从今年9月以来我们就按月发工资，现在存在银行的现款包括公社商业部门的流动资金在内有一百五十万元。我们的仓库里、木材场里和矿场里还有许多物资可以换成现款。这里充分说明进行商品生产的重要，只有把自给性生产和商品生产正确地相结合，公社经济才能真正活跃起来。
    今年我们还大力发展了工业生产，开始做到工、农业并举。今年我们公社搞农业生产是主要的，农、林、牧、副、渔五业占总收入的80％以上；工业原来是一张白纸，什么东西都没有，发展工业也毫无准备。但是，在下半年工业大跃进形势的影响下，全社大搞炼铁、挖煤、采石灰石、烧石灰、烧耐火砖、烧砖瓦、农具制造和修理，加上一部分手工业，工业收入也占到全社总收入的八分之一。而今年的工业生产仅仅只是开了个头，今后还可以大搞农产品加工和农具、农肥、农药制造，大搞采矿、炼铁，大搞建筑材料和大搞水电站。我们公社决定要根据国家和自己的需要，根据因地制宜，就地取材的原则，逐步实现公社工业化。
    现在回头想一想，为什么我们能实现全面生产大跃进呢？我想，最主要的是我们坚决贯彻了党中央和毛主席所提出的建设社会主义的总路线。总路线教育鼓舞了全乡人民，使全乡人民不甘愿受穷。越是穷地方就越要翻身，群众干劲特别大。但是光有劲头还不行，还要有道路。我们觉得原来的农业社的道路还不够宽阔，于是搞起了联社，以后发展成人民公社。人民公社一成立，我们就发挥人民公社的优越性，把农、林、牧、副、渔、工、矿各行业全面组织了起来。
    其次，有了决心，有了道路，还必须组织全面跃进的队伍。我们把公社的生产划分成粮食、林业、工业、畜牧养殖、多种经营五条战线，每条战线都至少配备有一个党委书记或社长担任司令员，负责专管。各条战线都配备有固定的基本劳动力组成专业队。在粮食生产最紧张的时候，全公社始终保持15％的劳动力继续进行那些不能间断的专业生产；在粮食生产比较和缓的时候，又抽调大批劳动力增加到最需要的战线上来。这样，有专业，又有协作，就保证了全线跃进。
    现在我们樟市乡已与乌石、大坑口两个乡合并成为一个三万人的公社。为了更好地执行中央提出的人民公社的生产方针，我们准备在继续提高粮食单位面积产量并保证总产量的基础上，进一步发展工业和多种经营。我们决心在党的正确领导下，和全国所有公社一道，为争取明年更伟大的胜利而奋斗！（附图片）
