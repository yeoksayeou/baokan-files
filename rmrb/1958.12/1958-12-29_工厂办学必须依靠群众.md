Factory-Run Schools Must Rely on the Masses

Following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on education, a great upsurge in running spare-time education has quickly emerged in factories and mines across the country. Factories and mines that originally only had literacy classes or primary school classes have now universally established middle schools, and some have even established universities, creating a complete education system within the factory. Schools that were originally run by cities, districts, or at most factories are now being run by workshops, work sections, and even the masses themselves. Spare-time schools that had previously been suspended have been restored, undergoing consolidation and reform.

Among the schools that have already been established, two different situations have emerged. Some schools are running vigorously, with workers eager to learn and good results in production, welcomed by administrative cadres, and even during the most intense steel production drive, learning has not been completely interrupted. Other schools, however, are running coldly and quietly, with workers reluctant to attend and leaders unwelcoming, and the school "dissolves" as soon as production becomes tense. Some say this is a case of "rushing in when school starts, slacking off in the middle, and ending up with nothing." There are, of course, many reasons why schools are run well or poorly, but a major one is whether they rely on the masses and conscientiously implement the mass line.

Doing any work requires relying on the masses and following the mass line, and running schools is naturally no exception. There doesn't seem to be any new issue to raise here, but that's not really the case. Although relying on the masses is not a new issue, some factories and mines have not done so when running schools, or have simply invited a few workers to a forum to solicit opinions. In this way, the masses find it difficult to offer many opinions, and the leaders mistakenly believe that the workers are laymen when it comes to running schools and cannot offer any worthwhile ideas. Thus, they set aside the masses and let a few full-time educators run the school. Those who truly rely on the masses to run schools do not do this. They first give the Central Committee's instructions on education to the masses to study and discuss, organize the masses to air their views freely, hold great debates, mobilize the masses to participate in various school-running activities, and solve various problems and difficulties in running the school. Facts have proven that once the masses grasp the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, they are no longer laymen on the issue of running schools, or unable to offer any opinions. On the contrary, they become resolute implementers of the Central Committee's instructions. Especially on the key issues of running the school, with the participation of the masses, they can smoothly solve the problems according to the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions; without the participation of the masses, it is inevitable to take detours, or slowly tread water.

Whether education is combined with production and serves production, or is divorced from production and does not serve production, is a fundamental issue of whether factory-run schools are run well and whether they can persist. To implement the Party's policy of combining education with production, it is necessary to thoroughly reform the educational system, teaching materials, and teaching methods. Who should these reforms rely on? At present, many full-time teachers and engineering technicians still have varying degrees of resistance to the Party's education policy. They believe that emphasizing service to production can only cultivate some "half-understood, half-baked unqualified talents," and feel that it doesn't matter whether such schools are run or not. Some full-time teachers, although they agree with the Party's education policy, are neither familiar with production nor with the workers' thoughts, feelings, and lives, and it is impossible to implement the policy of combining education with production by relying solely on them. Some factories and mines find it difficult to carry out teaching reforms well because they only rely on them. Therefore, in some factories and mines, workers are thinking and doing about the Great Leap Forward, but in class they are listening to "Guan Guan cry the ospreys" and "The Peach Blossom Spring". Workers encounter many problems in production, and learning does not help much in solving these problems. In this way, the masses' enthusiasm for learning will naturally be difficult to sustain. Taking the approach of mobilizing the masses from the bottom up to carry out teaching reform is a completely different situation. Factories and mines in Shanghai and other cities first mobilized the masses to freely air their views and hold great debates on teaching issues, and then adopted the method of combining veteran workers, technicians, and full-time teachers to compile teaching materials, revise the educational system, and improve teaching methods. Because veteran workers have rich production knowledge and understand the thoughts and requirements of the masses, combining their advantages with the theoretical knowledge of technicians and full-time teachers can initially produce a set of teaching methods and materials that are more suitable for the production needs of the factory and the characteristics of the workers. At present, although the educational system and newly compiled teaching materials formulated by many units are not yet perfect and do not need to be revised, they are welcomed by the masses and can directly promote production, so they can persist, continuously enrich and revise in practice, and gradually form a relatively complete set of courses and teaching materials suitable for the requirements of various industrial workers. Our emphasis on relying on the masses is not to negate the role of full-time teachers and technicians. They are still an indispensable force in running schools in factories, and their role should be well played. However, relying on the masses is not contradictory to giving full play to the role of full-time teachers. On the contrary, only by fully mobilizing the masses and making them closely integrated with the masses can the school be run well.

Running schools on a large scale requires a large number of teachers. Implementing the policy of combining education with production requires a large number of teachers who understand production and are familiar with workers. The number and quality of existing full-time teachers in factories and mines are far from meeting the current needs. In the current situation of such tight labor, where can the source of teachers be opened up? It is, of course, very difficult to rely on the Party committee to transfer them in from outside. Factories and schools are linked, and schools can provide factories with support in terms of teachers, but the number will not be too large. To solve this problem, we must also rely on the masses and mobilize the masses. That is to say, in addition to full-time teachers and technicians, a large number of teachers should be selected from veteran workers with rich production experience. According to the principle of "those who are capable can be teachers," whoever is familiar with what teaches what, and sometimes one course can be taught by three, five, or even ten or eight people separately. In this way, the source of teachers can be inexhaustible. Some people doubt whether workers can be both students and teachers at the same time. Of course, we are by no means saying that anyone can be a teacher, but only that many people who can be teachers can be found among the workers. For example, many veteran workers have rich production experience and can serve as teachers for a course they are familiar with. Of course, it cannot be said that veteran workers have no difficulties in being teachers. They are limited by a lack of culture and theoretical knowledge. They must rely on their own learning in this regard. On the one hand, they can also take some measures, such as organizing teacher refresher courses, and full-time teachers and technicians can tutor veteran workers, while learning from each other's strengths and compensating for each other's weaknesses. Or take the method of "combining native and foreign," "two people teaching one class," veteran workers and full-time teachers preparing lessons together, veteran workers talking about practice, and full-time teachers talking about theory, the effect is very good. In this way, not only can the difficulties of veteran workers giving lectures be solved, but also help full-time teachers and technicians improve teaching quality.

Whether carrying out spare-time education or half-work, half-study, it is first necessary to ensure study time. With production so tight at the moment, ensuring study time is very important. To solve this problem, we must first rely on the Party committee to make overall arrangements for study and other tasks, and at the same time, we must rely on the masses. The No. 2 workshop of the Chongqing Jiangling Machinery Factory had not been able to complete its production tasks from January to August. In September, the task was greatly increased. When the leadership wanted to transfer veteran workers to half-work, half-study, the workshop director and work section leaders had great concerns. At this time, the leadership mobilized the masses to study and discuss the Party's instructions on education, and handed over both production and study tasks to the masses for discussion and implementation. As a result, in September, 16% of the veteran workers were transferred to participate in half-work, half-study, and the production task was overfulfilled. This situation is not surprising. Because, in the case of tight production, only the workers themselves know best who needs to work overtime, who can not work overtime; who is busy these days, who is busy those days; and even what scraps of time can be squeezed out for study. As for the fundamental way to solve the problem of time—using technological innovation and improving efficiency to replace overtime work—it is even more necessary to mobilize and rely on the masses.

Since only by relying on the masses can schools be run on a large scale and well, why are many places unwilling to mobilize the masses to run schools? Their reason is: they are afraid of chaos!

The fear of chaos comes from the leadership. Factory leaders, especially those in charge of production, are afraid that after the masses are mobilized, they will disrupt the production order and fail to complete the production tasks. Therefore, they prefer to let a few people run the school. In fact, to run a school, it is necessary to mobilize and rely on the masses. Only by relying on the masses can the schools that are run be combined with production and serve production; without relying on the masses, running schools will really affect production.

In fact, chaos and non-chaos are inevitable phenomena in the process of development. We want to break the old and establish the new. For the old, the new is chaos. When the new is established, it is not chaos but governance. When boldly mobilizing the masses to carry out reforms and creations, it is always inevitable that there will be a period of chaos at the beginning, but as long as the leadership is strengthened, it can be transformed from chaos to governance in a timely manner. The issue of going from chaos to non-chaos is an issue of strengthening leadership. Centralized leadership and the mass line are a contradictory unity. Combining the two can reduce chaos, speed up governance, and find the road to solving problems more smoothly. This is a matter of walking on two legs. Factory and mine schools should be like this, and all other work should be like this.

### 工厂办学必须依靠群众

    工厂办学必须依靠群众
    党中央和国务院发出关于教育工作的指示以后，全国各地厂矿企业中很快地出现了大办业余教育的热潮。原来只有扫盲班或者小学班的厂矿企业，现在普遍办起了中学，有的还办了大学，在工厂中建立起一套完整的教育体系；原来只是市办、区办至多厂办学校的，现在车间、工段甚至群众自己也办起了学校；原来已经停顿下来的业余学校，都恢复起来，进行整顿和改革。
    在已经办起来的学校中，出现了两种不同的情况。有些学校办得生气勃勃，工人愿意学，生产上效果好，行政干部欢迎，即使在最紧张的大搞钢铁的时候，学习也没有完全中断；另外一些学校则办得冷冷清清，工人不高兴上，领导上也不欢迎，生产一紧张，学校就“散”了。有人说，这是“开学一哄，中间一松，末了一空”。学校办得好坏，原因当然很多，其中主要一项却是是否依靠群众，认真贯彻群众路线。
    做任何工作都要依靠群众、走群众路线，办学校自然也不例外，这里似乎并没有什么新问题需要提出，其实不然。依靠群众虽然并不是新问题，可是，有些厂矿在办学校的时候却没有这样做，或者只是简单地找上几个工人开个座谈会征求一下意见。这样，群众很难提出多少意见，领导者也就误认为办学校工人是外行，谈不出个所以然来，于是撇开群众，单由少数专职教育工作者去办学校。真正依靠群众办学的就不是这样。他们首先把中央关于教育工作的指示交给群众学习讨论，组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，发动群众参加各种办学工作，解决办学中的各种问题和困难。事实证明，群众一经掌握中央指示的精神，对办学问题就决不再是什么外行，或者提不出什么意见。相反的，他们就成为中央指示的坚决的执行者。特别是在办学的几个关键问题上，有群众参加，就能根据中央指示的精神，顺利地得到解决；没有群众参加，就不可避免地要走弯路，或者是慢吞吞地踏步不前。
    教育和生产相结合，为生产服务，还是脱离生产，不为生产服务，这是工厂办学办得好坏、能否坚持下去的一个根本问题。要贯彻执行党的教育和生产结合的方针，就需要在学制、教材、教学方法等方面彻底进行改革。依靠谁来进行这些改革呢？目前，不少专职教师和工程技术人员对于党的教育方针还有程度不同的抵触情绪，他们认为强调为生产服务，就只能培养出一些“似解非解、似通非通的不合规格的人材”，觉得这样的学校办也罢，不办也罢。有些专职教师虽然赞成党的教育方针，可是，他们既不熟悉生产又不熟悉工人的思想感情和生活，单单依靠他们也不可能贯彻教育和生产相结合的方针。有些厂矿因为只依靠他们进行教学改革，就很难改革得好。因而在有些厂矿中工人们干的想的都是大跃进，上课听的却是“关关睢鸠”、“桃花源记”。工人在生产中碰到许多问题，学习对于解决这些问题并没有多少帮助。这样，群众的学习热情自然就很难持久。采取自下而上发动群众的办法进行教学改革，就完全是另一种情况。上海及其他一些城市的厂矿都是首先发动群众对教学问题大放大鸣大辩论，而后采取老工人、技术人员、专职教师三结合的办法自编教材，修改学制、改进教学方法。因为老工人生产知识丰富，懂得群众的思想和要求，把他们的这些优点和技术人员专职教师的理论知识结合起来，就能够初步搞出一套比较适合本厂生产需要和工人特点的教学方法和教材。目前，虽然许多单位制定的学制和新编的教材并不是已经非常完善而不必再作什么修改了，但是，它们是受群众欢迎的，又能直接推动生产，因此，就能坚持下去，在实践中不断充实和修改，逐渐形成一套比较完善的适合于各种不同产业工人要求的课程和教材。我们强调依靠群众并不是否定专职教师和技术人员的作用，他们还是我们在工厂中办学校的不可缺少的力量，他们的作用应该很好地发挥。但是，依靠群众同发挥专职教师的作用不但不矛盾，相反地，只有充分发动群众，使他们和群众密切结合起来才能把学校办好。
    大办学校需要大量的师资。贯彻教育和生产结合的方针，需要大量懂得生产、熟悉工人的教师。厂矿中现有的专职教师无论在数量还是质量都远远不能满足当前的需要。在目前劳动力这样紧张的情况下，从哪里开辟师资的来源？依靠党委从外面调进，这当然困难很多。工厂和学校挂钩，学校可以在师资方面给工厂以支援，但为数也不会太多。解决这个问题，同样要依靠群众、发动群众。就是说，除了专职教师、技术人员外，要大量地从富有生产经验的老工人中选拔教师。根据能者为师的原则，谁熟悉什么就讲什么，一门课有时可以由三个五个甚至十个八个人分别来教。这样，教师的来源就可源源不绝。有人怀疑，工人既是学生，能不能同时又是先生呢？当然，我们决不是说无论什么人都可以当教员，而只是说在工人群众中可以发现不少人可以当教员。例如，许多老工人有丰富的生产经验，就可以担任他们熟悉的某一门课的教员。当然，不能说老工人做教员就没有困难了，他们受到缺少文化和理论知识的限制，这方面要靠他们自己学习，一方面还可以采取一些措施，如组织教师进修班，由专职教师和技术人员对老工人进行辅导，同时互相取长补短。或者采取“土洋结合”、“一堂课两人教”的办法，老工人和专职教师一起备课，老工人讲实际，专职教师讲理论，效果很好。这样，不但可以解决老工人讲课的困难，同样也有助于专职教师和技术人员提高教学质量。
    不论开展业余教育或者半工半读，首先需要保证学习时间。当前生产这样紧张，保证学习时间是非常重要的。解决这个问题，首先依靠党委对学习和其他各项工作统筹安排，同时必须依靠群众。重庆江陵机械厂的二车间1至8月份的生产任务一直完成不好，9月份任务增加了很多，领导上要抽调老工人半工半读的时候，车间主任和工段长的顾虑就很大。这时，领导上发动群众学习讨论党的教育工作指示，把生产和学习任务都交给群众讨论执行。结果，9月份既抽调了16％的老工人参加半工半读，又超额完成生产任务。这情况并不奇怪。因为，在生产紧张的情况下，哪些人需要加班，哪些人可以不加班；哪些人这几天紧张，哪些人那几天紧张，以致有哪些零碎时间可以挤出来学习等等，只有工人自己最清楚。至于解决时间问题的根本办法——用革新技术、提高效率来代替加班加点，这更需要发动群众、依靠群众。
    既然只有依靠群众才能大办学校和办好学校，而不少地方为什么又不肯发动群众办学呢？他们的理由是：怕乱！
    怕乱的想法来自领导方面。工厂的领导干部特别是管生产的干部，他们怕群众发动起来以后，打乱了生产秩序，完不成生产任务，因此，宁愿由少数人去办学校。其实，要办学校，就要发动群众、依靠群众。只有依靠群众，办起的学校才能和生产结合，为生产服务；不依靠群众，办起学校倒真是要影响生产。
    其实，乱与不乱是事物在发展过程中的不可免的现象。我们要破旧立新，对于旧的来说，新的就是乱，当新的确立起来以后，就不是乱而是治了。在放手发动群众去大胆进行改革和创造的时候，开始总是难免有一阵子乱，但是，只要加强领导，就可以及时地从乱到治。从乱到不乱的问题，是加强领导的问题。集中领导和群众路线是对立的统一，两者结合起来，就可以乱得少些，治得快些，就可以比较顺利地找到解决问题的道路。这是两条腿走路的问题。厂矿办学应该如此，其他一切工作也应该如此。
