Title: The "Big" and "Small" of Amateur Red and Expert Universities

    The current amateur Red and Expert Universities (called Agricultural Universities in some places) have their "big" aspects and their "small" aspects. It is wrong to not see their "big" aspects; it is also wrong to not see their "small" aspects.

    Some people, because of the influence of bourgeois educational viewpoints in their minds, are unwilling to admit the "big" aspects of the amateur "Red and Expert Universities." They feel quite irritated when they see these amateur schools putting up university signs. Some say, "What university? It's not even as good as an elementary school!" Some sarcastically say, "University, university, a school for adults!" The eyes of these people have been confused by the bourgeois educational system. May I ask: is the cotton department of the amateur Red and Expert University cultivating and studying how to achieve per-mu yields of a thousand or two thousand catties of ginned cotton a big thing, a big field of knowledge? Is the paddy rice department cultivating and studying how to achieve per-mu yields of ten thousand or tens of thousands of catties of rice a big thing, a big field of knowledge? Where is it inferior to "regular" universities? True, there are no professors who have studied abroad in the amateur Red and Expert Universities, but there are professors who are good at achieving high yields. They lack systematic scientific knowledge, which is where they are far inferior to the professors of "regular" universities; however, in terms of their production experience, practical production knowledge, the experiments they conduct, and the achievements obtained from the experiments, aren't they much better than some university professors who have studied abroad?

    However, the significant meaning of the amateur "Red and Expert Universities" lies not only in their "big" aspects, but also in the fact that they have creatively found a basic path and method for popularizing and improving cultural education among the broad masses of laborers. They cleverly combine the popularization and improvement of cultural education with the characteristics of adults and producers and with production practice, directly serving current production, not only learning in their spare time, but also learning in production. They combine popularization and improvement, engaging in cutting-edge high-yield research on the one hand, and learning basic cultural and scientific knowledge on the other. In this way, cultural education can be popularized and improved more, faster, better, and more economically, and the current Great Leap Forward in production and the technological revolution can be directly promoted.

    Very good! Really very good!

    Of course, we must also see that they also have "small" aspects. Where are they "small"? Mainly in the area of basic cultural and scientific knowledge. In this area, indeed, most are still at the elementary school stage. This is a fact. Due to the lack of systematic basic scientific knowledge, the "Red and Expert Universities" have not yet been able to make scientific summaries of high-yield experiences for the time being. This is also a manifestation of "smallness." If we deny its "smallness" and think that as long as Red and Expert Universities are universally established, higher education has already been popularized, then this is not a realistic attitude, and it lowers our goals. It would be completely wrong to use Red and Expert Universities to negate national universities, just as it would be wrong to acknowledge "small indigenous groups" and deny "large foreign groups" in industry. Red and Expert Universities need to be improved. Those who are satisfied with the status quo of Red and Expert Universities or who attempt to simply replace regular universities with Red and Expert Universities are essentially ignoring the people's growing demands for culture and technology.

    In short, don't look at problems with one eye, look at them with two eyes; don't walk on one leg, walk on two legs. This should be the case with the "Red and Expert University" issue, and it should be the case with other issues as well.

    业余红专大学的大和小
    何明
    目前的业余红专大学（有的地方叫农业大学），有它“大”的方面，也有它“小”的方面。看不到它的“大”是错误的；看不到它的“小”也是不对的。
    有些人，由于资产阶级教育观点在脑子里作怪，不肯承认业余“红专大学”之“大”。他们看到这些业余学校挂上大学的牌子，颇觉刺目。有的说：“什么大学，连小学也不如！”有的讽刺说：“大学，大学，大人上的学校！”这些人的眼睛被资产阶级那一套教育体系搞迷糊了。请问：业余红专大学的棉花系栽培和钻研亩产千斤、两千斤皮棉，这件事、这项学问大不大？水稻系栽培和钻研亩产万斤、几万斤稻子，这件事、这项学问大不大？它比“正规”大学差在哪里？不错，业余红专大学里没有留过洋的教授，但是却有善搞高产的教授。他们缺乏系统的科学知识，这方面比“正规”大学的教授差得远；但是，就他们的生产经验、实际的生产知识，他们搞的试验、试验所得到的成就这方面来看，不是比若干留过洋的大学教授高明得多吗？
    但是，业余“红专大学”的重大意义，不仅在于有其“大”的方面；而且还在于它创造性地找到了在广大劳动者中间普及和提高文化教育的一条基本道路、基本方法。它把普及、提高文化教育，巧妙地根据成年人、生产者的特点和生产实践结合了起来，直接为当前的生产服务，不但在业余学，而且就在生产中学。它把普及和提高结合了起来，一方面搞尖端性的丰产研究，一方面又学习文化科学基础知识。这样，可以多快好省地普及和提高文化教育，又可以直接推动当前的生产大跃进和技术革命。
    好得很！真是好得很！
    当然，我们也要看到它还有“小”的方面。“小”在哪里？主要的就小在文化科学基础知识方面。这一方面，的确大部分还处在小学阶段。这是事实。由于缺乏系统的科学基础知识，“红专大学”对高额丰产的经验也还一时作不出科学的总结。这也是“小”的表现。如果否认它的“小”，认为只要普遍成立了红专大学就算已经普及了高等教育，那就不是实事求是的态度了，那就降低了我们的奋斗目标。如果用红专大学否定国立大学，更是完全错误的，就如同工业上承认“小土群”、否认“大洋群”同样错误。红专大学需要提高。那些满足于红专大学现状或者企图干脆用红专大学代替正规大学的人，实质上是无视群众日益增长的文化技术的要求。
    总之，不要用一只眼睛看问题，要用两只眼睛看问题；不要用一条腿走路，要用两条腿走路。在“红专大学”问题上要这样，在其他问题上也要这样。
