Title: Dulles is Losing His Mind

There's an American fool,
He's heartbroken for the communes,
Tears and snot streaming,
Wolf fangs bared three inches.
"I love Chinese families,
More than Confucius,
They want to start communes,
America will never recognize it!"
"Desecrating ancestral graves,
Destroying sacred families,
Disregarding ancient traditions,
Breaks my old Dulles's heart!"
He swings his cane,
Almost fainting with rage,
Foam spewing from his mouth,
"China has no individuality!"
"And and and...
America will never recognize it!"
Hysteria erupts,
Hatred intensifies hatred.
He lets out a string of stinky farts,
Surrounded by icy silence,
Only Tito applauds,
Following with a few curses.
The era has long since changed,
But he keeps his eyes closed,
The people have seized power,
And manage the universe themselves.
Today's Chinese countryside,
Is a scene of bumper harvests,
Men and women, old and young, sing joyously,
Celebrating the birth of the communes.
The commune is strength,
Reaching up to the heavens and down to earth;
The commune is a ladder,
Leading to a paradise of happiness.
One foot kicks away ignorance,
One foot kicks away poverty,
Hands create paradise,
The fountain of life gushes forth.
Everywhere are smiling faces,
Everywhere are songs,
Everyone is loving and respectful,
Each has a happy family.
In this heroic land,
Spring all year round,
Exotic flowers bloom everywhere,
Stubborn stones nod and turn to gold.

It's strange how that American fool,
Hates and grieves so much,
Upon hearing of China's Great Leap Forward,
He wakes up startled in the middle of the night.
His delirium mixes with sneezes:
"No, no, no!"
Holding a butcher knife in his hand,
He shivers all over.
An ant trying to shake a tree,
A mantis trying to stop a cart,
A fool dreaming foolish dreams,
Dreaming of the sun rising in the west.
Let the dogs bark as they may,
The horses continue forward as usual. (Note)
The giant stands tall and firm,
The red sun is rising from the east.
Note: Russian folk proverb

    杜勒斯在发昏
    海棱有个美国蠢人，他为公社伤心，眼泪鼻涕横流，狼牙露出三寸。“我爱中国家庭，甚过孔二先生，他们要搞公社，美国决不承认。”“亵渎祖先坟墓，破坏神圣家庭，蔑视古老传统，叫我老杜伤心！”他把手杖一抡，几乎气得发昏，口里乱喷白沫，“中国不要个性！”“还有还有还有……美国决不承认！”大发歇斯底里，仇恨更加仇恨。放了一阵臭屁，周围冷冷清清，只有铁托鼓掌，跟着骂了几声。时代早已改变，他却闭着眼睛，人民坐了江山，自己掌管乾坤。今日中国农村，一片丰收年景，男女老少欢唱，欢唱公社诞生。公社就是力量，上天入地都行；公社就是天梯，通往幸福天庭。一脚踢开愚昧，一脚踢开贫困，双手创造乐园，生活源泉滚滚。处处都是笑脸，处处都是歌声，人人相亲相敬，各有快乐家庭。在这英雄国土，常年四季如春，奇花遍地开放，顽石点头成金。
  可怪美国蠢人，
  如此仇恨伤心，
  闻听中国跃进，
  半夜梦中惊醒。
  梦呓夹着喷嚏：
  “不准不准不准！”
  手里掌着屠刀，
  浑身打着寒噤。
  蚍蜉想撼大树，
  螳螂想挡车轮，
  蠢人尽做蠢梦，
  梦见太阳西升。狗儿尽管狂吠，马儿照常前进。（注）巨人巍然屹立，红日正从东升。注：俄罗斯民间谚语
