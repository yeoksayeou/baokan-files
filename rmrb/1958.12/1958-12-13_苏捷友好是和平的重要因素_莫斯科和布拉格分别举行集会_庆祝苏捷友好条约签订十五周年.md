Xinhua News Agency, December 12th – According to TASS, Moscow: Moscow held a celebration last night at the Moscow State Conservatory Hall to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Czechoslovak Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation.

    Czechoslovak Chargé d'Affaires ad interim, Kobetsky, said at the meeting that the Soviet-Czechoslovak Friendship Treaty is an important factor for peace. West German militarists and their American protectors have forgotten too soon the fate of Hitler and the entire fascist Germany. Kobetsky said that Czechoslovakia and other fraternal countries are doing their best to strengthen the Warsaw Pact and support the first worker-peasant state in German history - the German Democratic Republic.

    Kobetsky said that Czechoslovakia welcomes the Soviet government's proposals on the Berlin issue and believes that this proposal is very important from the perspective of Czechoslovakia's own security.

    Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Tarasov, also delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the Soviet-Czechoslovak Friendship Treaty fully embodies the principles of Lenin's Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Union has always defended the independence and sovereignty of every country. This treaty does not stipulate any superior position or privilege of one country over another. Its purpose is entirely to strengthen the security of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, to safeguard their national independence, and to consolidate peace in Europe.

    On December 12th, "Pravda" also published an editorial commemorating the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Czechoslovak Friendship Treaty.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 11th – The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Central Committee of the National Front jointly held a meeting in Prague this afternoon to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Cooperation. The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Novotny, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the Czechoslovak-Soviet treaty vividly embodies the principles of proletarian internationalism, and proletarian internationalism is the content of the close revolutionary unity between the working people of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and their revolutionary parties.

    Novotny said that the close cooperation between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union in various fields due to this treaty has enabled Czechoslovakia to establish the material foundation of socialism.

    Novotny emphasized the importance of every Communist Party contributing to the ideological and political unity of the socialist camp. He emphasized that recognizing the leading role of the Soviet Union in the socialist camp, and recognizing the role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as the center of the international revolutionary workers' movement, is a decisive and necessary condition for all Communist Parties to consistently adopt a Marxist-Leninist approach in the struggle for world peace and socialism.

    苏捷友好是和平的重要因素
    莫斯科和布拉格分别举行集会
    庆祝苏捷友好条约签订十五周年
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各界人士昨晚在莫斯科国立音乐学院大厅举行庆祝会，纪念苏捷友好互助与战后合作条约签订十五周年。
    捷克斯洛伐克临时代办柯别茨基在会上讲话说，苏捷友好条约是和平的重要因素。西德军国主义者和他们的美国庇护人过早地忘记了希特勒和整个法西斯德国的下场。柯别茨基说，捷克斯洛伐克以及其他兄弟国家都尽力加强华沙条约和支持德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国。
    柯别茨基说，捷克斯洛伐克欢迎苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议，并认为，从捷克斯洛伐克本身安全来看这个建议也是十分重要的。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席塔拉索夫也在会上做了报告。他指出，苏捷友好条约完全体现了列宁的苏联外交政策的原则，苏联过去和现在始终维护每个国家的独立和主权。这一条约没有规定一个国家对另一个国家的任何优越地位和特权，它的目的完全是在于加强苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的安全，保障它们的民族独立以及巩固欧洲和平。
    12日“真理报”还发表了纪念苏捷友好条约签订十五周年的社论。
    据新华社布拉格11日电  捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会和民族阵线中央委员会今天下午在布拉格联合举行会议，庆祝捷苏友好互助与战后合作条约签订十五周年。捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼在会上讲了话。他强调指出，捷苏条约生动地体现了无产阶级国际主义的原则，而无产阶级国际主义是苏捷两国劳动人民和他们的革命政党之间的亲密的革命团结的内容。
    诺沃提尼说，由于这项条约而来的捷苏两国在各方面的密切合作，使捷克斯洛伐克得以建立社会主义的物质基础。
    诺沃提尼着重谈到了每一个共产党为社会主义阵营在意识形态上和政治上的团结一致贡献力量的重要性。他强调说，承认苏联在社会主义阵营中的领导作用，承认苏联共产党作为国际革命工人运动的中心的作用，是所有共产党在争取世界和平与社会主义的斗争中一贯采取马克思列宁主义方针的决定性的必要条件。
