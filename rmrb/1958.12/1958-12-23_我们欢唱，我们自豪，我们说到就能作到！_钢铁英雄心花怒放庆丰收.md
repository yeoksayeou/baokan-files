Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The victorious news that the nation's steel production had surpassed 10.7 million tons ahead of schedule this year has inspired the people of the capital.

The steelworkers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company immediately cheered upon hearing the news. The Party and administrative leaders of the company personally went to the steelmaking workshop to congratulate the workers. The workers expressed their determination to continue to exert their efforts and make greater contributions to the great leap forward in steel production next year.

The workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant were so excited that they danced with joy upon hearing the news. An DeRun, an experienced steelworker, happily said, "The speed of our steel production leap is unmatched by any capitalist country. Now the Party has proposed the task of completing 18 million tons of steel next year. We guarantee that, on the one hand, we will learn advanced steelmaking experience and improve technology, and on the other hand, we will teach the techniques I have mastered to more new steelmaking recruits, so that more steelworkers can fight together for 18 million tons of steel."

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 22nd: The great news that the national target of 10.7 million tons of steel had been completed ahead of schedule was transmitted to Shanghai, giving tremendous encouragement to the tens of thousands of people fighting on the steel front.

Large and medium-sized steel plants such as Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and No. 6 Steel Plant have been broadcasting the good news to their workshops since last night, preparing for celebrations overnight. Gu Hengli, a worker from the National Converter Red Banner Workshop, the No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, composed a poem today, saying: "Ten million and seventy thousand tons lead the way, hearts blossom with endless joy. Steel ingots pile up higher than Mount Everest, overflowing the Milky Way to form a long rainbow. Immortals hastily leave the sky, descending to earth to compete to be steelworkers." The Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant, which was just built this year, has already contributed to the task of 10.7 million tons of steel. Director Feng Yi said, "Next year, we will not only strive to tap our potential to produce more steel, but also develop in the direction of producing high-quality steel and alloy steel, and contribute more to the national production of 18 million tons of steel."

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 22nd: When the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the victorious news of completing 10.7 million tons of steel on the evening of the 21st, a scene of high morale and jubilation appeared on the dozens of miles-long battlefront of Anshan Iron and Steel, from mining and iron smelting to steelmaking and steel rolling.

The open-hearth furnace workers of Class B of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant were as boiling as the molten steel in the furnace. One by one, reflecting the furnace water, after greedily reading the striking red words on the extra issue that marked the victorious completion of the 10.7 million-ton task, they felt like they had an extra motor on their bodies and worked even harder.

After hearing the good news of the great victory in steel production from the radio on the evening of the 21st, the workers of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant happily congratulated each other, and a burst of gongs, drums, and firecrackers immediately rang out in the workshop and in front of the office. With the support of all parties, the workers of the famous Youth Solidarity Furnace shortened the time to produce a furnace of molten steel by more than an hour compared to usual.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 22nd: The good news that the task of 10.7 million tons of steel had been overfulfilled ahead of schedule aroused great jubilation among the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel.

When they went to work in the early morning, the workers warmly ran to tell each other the good news and congratulated each other on the great victory in steel production. Bao Xiuliang, a well-known advanced producer and furnace worker, said that not long ago we celebrated the early completion of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel, and now we are celebrating the great victory of the people's steel seizure. The furnace worker, who had tasted the bitterness of the old society, said excitedly: The early completion of 10.7 million tons of steel is the victory of the Party's call and the victory of the people's great steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, December 22nd: Tens of thousands of workers who are braving the severe cold to build Baotou Steel today issued a heroic oath when cheering the victory of our country's successful completion of 10.7 million tons of steel: We will guarantee to build Baotou Steel at a faster speed, so that it can produce iron, steel, and steel products earlier.

A celebration rally was held at the construction site of the large steel plant. Zhang Chunxuan, the director of the construction site, said at the meeting that we must put the open-hearth furnace into production ahead of schedule, and strive for our steel plant to participate in the battle of 18 million tons of steel next year.

The coking plant was filled with gongs and drums today, and colorful flags fluttered on the tall buildings. A conference of more than a thousand people was also held here to celebrate the great victory in steel production, and also to celebrate the completion of the plant's first large coking furnace. This large coking furnace will be put into production during the Spring Festival, six months ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 22nd: The 100,000 workers of Chongqing's steel plants cheered the great victory in steel production with great excitement.

After hearing the news that 10.7 million tons of steel had been overfulfilled ahead of schedule, the workers of the Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant were so excited that they lifted up the Party committee secretary of the plant and the steelworkers in front of the furnace. Many workers immediately composed clappers and danced. Cheng Jiyang, an old steelworker who entered the factory as an apprentice at the age of thirteen, wrote a poem: "The miracle of completing '1070' is world-renowned. The power of peace is growing, and imperialism is losing its soul!"

The Chongqing steelworkers, who contributed their greatest strength to steel production this year, are full of victorious confidence and are prepared to make greater contributions next year. Tan Jun, a steelworker in the open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, said: "The Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party proposed the task of producing 18 million tons of steel next year, which is the great goal of our steelworkers' struggle. We must overcome difficulties with soaring energy, further tap the potential of the open-hearth furnace, and strive for the whole company to complete this greater and more glorious task."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 22nd: The leading cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Tianjin Steel Plant carried a huge victory sign this morning, and beat gongs and drums to spread the news of the great victory in steel production throughout the plant. All the employees of the plant were overjoyed.

The Youth Steelmaking Class, which won the mobile red flag of the whole plant, held a celebration meeting next to the converter. The steelworkers all expressed that they must continue to improve their technical level and strive to make greater contributions in steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 22nd: After the good news that the plan of 10.7 million tons of steel had been completed ahead of schedule reached Shangcheng County, Henan, the famous steelmaking production area using indigenous methods, a celebration rally attended by more than 1,300 people was immediately held in Chengguan. Liu Baoyin, secretary of the Shangcheng County Party Committee, who fought alongside the workers for steel, delivered a report at the conference. He said that this great victory was achieved under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country conscientiously implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction. He called on the people of the county to continue to exert their efforts with the spirit of continuous revolution, give full play to greater wisdom and strength, and strive to welcome the national production of 18 million tons of steel in 1959.

The fifty-eight factory directors who participated in the on-site steel conference convened by the county party committee guaranteed to mobilize the workers and masses to realize full automation of material charging, semi-mechanization of mining, semi-mechanization of crushing, hot air for furnaces, calcination of ore, production safety, and vehicle transportation in a very short time, and make preparations for a greater leap forward in technology and material resources.

In order to celebrate this victory and welcome the new glorious task in 1959, the Shangcheng County Party Committee conscientiously summarized the experience of large-scale steel production in 1958, and put forward a new leap forward plan and new measures for the people of the county in 1959.
