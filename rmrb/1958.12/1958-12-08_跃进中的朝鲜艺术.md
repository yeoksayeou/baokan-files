The Glorious Development of National Art

The national art of Korea has a long tradition.

Since ancient times, the Korean people have been able to sing and dance. In their collective labor, the art of song and dance has developed and become a part of life.

In ancient times, people held festivals every autumn after the harvest. During the festivals, they carried out rich and colorful song and dance activities. The dance at that time, with its waving arms and stamping feet, had the characteristic of shoulder movements. Today's farmers' dance inherits this tradition.

The Korean people created songs about agricultural affairs during labor, such as weeding songs, waterwheel songs, spinning wheel songs, weaving songs, etc., and also created a variety of songs about the ocean.

In Korea, mask plays and puppet shows began to develop early on. By the 17th and 18th centuries, with the development of novels and song and dance, various arts such as Changgeuk opera flourished. These works reflected the people's sharp satire of the feudal ruling class and their prediction of their inevitable demise.

Our literature and art have a strong patriotic ideology of resisting foreign aggression. This ideology was carried forward in the struggle to defend against and repel Japanese aggression. The patriotic tradition of the Korean people has become the central idea expressed in Korean literature and art, which has made the realistic tradition of our national art shine brilliantly.

In the 20th century, our literature and art became a sharp ideological weapon against the aggression of Japan and Western European imperialist countries. Under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Korean working class appeared on the political stage as the leading force in the national liberation struggle. The establishment of the "Korean Proletarian Art League" enabled Korean literature and art to move forward along the path of socialist realism. The anti-Japanese armed struggle led by Marshal Kim Il-sung further enhanced the combat effectiveness, Party spirit, and popular character of Korean literature and art. Marshal Kim Il-sung's personally written works at that time, such as "Sea of Blood," "Celebration Meeting," and "Seonghwangdang," the revolutionary songs sung by guerrillas and the people, and the mass dances they danced, became valuable assets in the development of socialist realistic art in our country.

After the great Soviet army liberated Korea on August 15, 1945, thanks to the correct literary and art policies implemented by the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, the excellent traditions of our national art have achieved brilliant development. This period is the era of the development of Korean socialist national art.

During this period, the traditional patriotism of the Korean people has gained a socialist spirit, making it a powerful ideological weapon against the US imperialism and the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique.

Today, our national art, combining socialist content with national forms, and under the guidance of the literary and art policies formulated by the Korean Workers' Party based on Lenin's principles, takes promoting the nationwide struggle to leap on the Chollima and build socialism as its banner.

Creations Reflecting Revolutionary Struggle and Labor

Korean writers and artists regard reflecting the revolutionary traditions of the motherland as their sacred duty. In particular, works that reflect the anti-Japanese armed struggle led by Marshal Kim Il-sung with touching artistic images make all the people more loyal to the Party and the motherland. The recently staged drama "Snow Peak Mountain" and the opera "Speak, Dense Forest," are excellent works that reflect our country's revolutionary traditions.

At the same time, the theme of socialist labor has also been fully expressed in our art. The recently staged dramas "Great Power" and "Pioneers" vividly depict the images of advanced workers and farmers who are building socialism by leaping on the Chollima.

These works all describe the glory of socialist labor and the mutual relations between people in socialist society with artistic images, and reflect the greatness of labor with a revolutionary romantic tone.

Our literature and art powerfully expose the crimes of the US imperialists and their lackeys, the Syngman Rhee clique, and their inhuman atrocities, and express the sacred struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The drama "Wolf" and the artistic film "How Can We Live Separately?" are works on this theme. In addition, many striking visual art works have appeared exposing the atrocities of US imperialism.

In the struggle against US imperialists, especially in the Fatherland Liberation War, the unparalleled heroism and revolutionary heroism displayed by the Korean people have further developed Korean art with this theme. Many artistic works such as dramas, music, dance, and fine arts have expressed the heroic deeds of heroes such as "Hill 1211" and "Eorangchon" and unforgettable frontline events. The drama "Hero Lee Su-bok," the dance "My Hill," the symphonies "Forward to Victory!" and "For the Motherland," and the oil painting "Hero Jo Ok-hee" and many other works typically reflect the patriotic struggle of the Korean people.

Holding High the Banner of Internationalism

All our victories have been achieved under the banner of proletarian internationalist ideology, with the fraternal support, unity, and mutual assistance of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The victory of the Fatherland Liberation War is the same, and the victorious advance of socialist construction today is also the same. Internationalist thought has become one of the basic characteristics of our literature and art.

The heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers, such as the hero Huang Jiguang who blocked the enemy's fire with his chest, the martyr Luo Shengjiao who saved a Korean boy with his life, the martyr Wang Yongyou who sacrificed himself to save an old Korean woman under the indiscriminate bombing of enemy planes, as well as the heroes of Shangganling and the great spirit and immortal achievements of proletarian internationalism of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, have become noble images and themes in our literary and artistic works.

Our writers and artists have created a large number of songs and dances that celebrate the friendly unity between fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union. Works that sing the praises of Korean-Chinese friendship include the drama "We Will Fight Together Forever" and the dance "Meeting on the Hill." These dramas and dances praise the friendship forged in blood by the people of the two countries.

Today, our national art is permeated with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and it has become an ideological weapon for the struggle for national liberation and a weapon for the struggle for world peace.

Korean national art is constantly absorbing the good experiences of fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and China. This makes Korean national art develop more rapidly and shine with brilliance. Many works such as the drama "The Kremlin Bells" (Soviet Union), "Growing Up in Battle" (China), and the opera "Ivan Susanin" (Soviet Union) have been translated into Korean and staged. In addition, many songs and dances from fraternal countries are also performed in our country.

With the increasing frequency of cultural exchanges between fraternal countries, the Korean Art Troupe has paid friendly visits to fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and China, and has also participated in the World Youth Student Festivals several times. Korean national art has been able to show the characteristics of its national art and the superiority of the socialist system in these performances, thus contributing to strengthening the friendly unity between the people of various countries.

During several visits to China by the Korean Art Troupe, they performed traditional Korean songs, dances, music, and Changgeuk opera. The Changgeuk opera "Chunhyangjeon," "Shimcheongjeon," and the opera "Kongjwi and Patjwi" have been loved by the Chinese people. Not only that, but scripts such as "Chunhyangjeon" and "Shimcheongjeon" have been translated into Chinese and performed on Chinese stages. In particular, the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers Art Troupe who visited Korea not long ago brought back many Korean folk songs and dances from Korea and held performances in Beijing. They deeply appreciated the characteristics of Korean folk songs and dances and skillfully visualized them. There is no doubt that this is one of the brilliant achievements in the cultural exchange between our two countries.

This time, the Korean Democratic People's Republic Art Troupe visited China and performed some Chinese songs and dances, which is not only of great significance in strengthening fraternal friendship, but also through these performances, we have learned a lot, which is of great help to the development of Korean art.

The Vanguard on the Party's Ideological Front

At present, our country has more than 1,000 writers, more than 30 various art troupes, and more than 3,500 full-time artists working in art film studios and documentary, scientific, and news film studios. In addition, the Music University, Fine Arts University, Writers Academy, Drama School, Film Cadre School, and Dance School are training thousands of young writers and artists. Korean writers and artists participate in specialized organizations such as the Writers Union, Composers Union, Fine Arts Union, and various theaters. They are the reliable vanguard of the Korean Workers' Party on the ideological front and staunch fighters for implementing the Party's literary and art policies.

In the more than ten years since liberation, our literature and art have developed rapidly and achieved great achievements. One of the characteristics is the development of mass movements in literature and art. Mass cultural undertakings have developed rapidly and promoted full-time writers and artists to go deep among the working masses, contact life, and develop literature and art among the masses. The Korean Workers' Party calls on writers and artists to go to the people to work and study. They go to production posts, serve as editors-in-chief of factory and enterprise newspapers or directors of rural clubs, they work, study, and create at the same time, and guide literary and art activities. In October this year alone, 150 artists went to actual life.

Our country's socialist economy has occupied the sole ruling position in various economic sectors, and at the same time, a high tide of socialist construction has been set off across the country, which is conducive to promoting the universal flowering of literature and art. In industrial and mining enterprises, agricultural production cooperatives, fishing villages, schools, and streets, there are more than 74,000 various literary and art groups with more than 1.7 million literary and art workers. In recent years, the amazing achievements of several national art festivals have shown how novel and rich the artistic talents of the working people of our country are.

From the following figures, we can see the significant achievements made in art since liberation: more than 500 various films, more than 1,300 various theatrical works, and countless songs and dance sketches. All these works have become powerful weapons for educating the people with socialist patriotic ideology.

In order to ensure the development of national art, the Party and the government have established the National National Art Theater, the National Art Theater, and the Dance Theater, and have developed a variety of art forms such as Changgeuk opera, opera, dance drama, national orchestral music, and folk songs. From the central to the local levels, all art troupes and amateur art organizations have mastered national music and national dance. "Gayageum singing" has become widely popular among the masses, and national dance has become an indispensable part of the lives of working people.

Our literature and art have adhered to and developed the Leninist principles of our literature and art by launching sharp ideological struggles against anti-Party factionalism and bourgeois literary and artistic thought and its ideological remnants. Marshal Kim Il-sung often teaches literary and art workers to become the Party's loyal ideological troops and to be loyal to Marxism-Leninism. In recent years, when revisionist theories have emerged in some countries and attempted to slander and vilify socialist realism, Korean literary and art workers, under the strong leadership of the Party, have raised the banner of socialist realism even higher. Korean art, with thousands of years of history, is now in an unprecedented golden age. (Attached picture)

    跃进中的朝鲜艺术
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团团长  赵灵出
    民族艺术的光辉发展
    朝鲜的民族艺术，具有悠久的传统。
    自古以来，朝鲜人民就能歌善舞。在他们的集体劳动中，歌舞艺术得到了发展，并成为生活中的一部分。
    古代的人们，每逢秋收完毕都要举行祭典。在祭典期间，他们开展丰富多采的歌舞活动。当时那种手舞足蹈的舞蹈具有动肩膀的特点。今天的农乐舞就接受了这一传统。
    朝鲜人民在劳动中创作了有关农事的歌谣，如锄草歌、水车谣、纺车谣、织布歌等，并且也创作了有关海洋的多种多样的歌谣。
    在朝鲜，假面剧、木偶剧早已开始发展，到十七、十八世纪，随着小说、歌舞的发展，唱剧等各种艺术也欣欣向荣。这些作品反映了人民对封建统治阶级的尖锐讽刺和对他们必将灭亡的命运的预见。
    我国文学艺术是具有浓厚的反抗外来侵略的爱国主义思想的。这种思想，在防御和击退日本侵略的斗争中发扬光大。朝鲜人民的爱国主义传统成为朝鲜文学艺术表现的中心思想，它使我们的民族艺术的现实主义传统发出了灿烂的光芒。
    到二十世纪，我们的文学艺术成为反对日本和西欧帝国主义国家侵略的锐利的思想武器。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下，朝鲜工人阶级作为民族解放斗争的领导力量出现在政治舞台上。“朝鲜无产阶级艺术同盟”的成立，使朝鲜文学艺术沿着社会主义现实主义的道路向前发展。金日成元帅领导的抗日武装斗争，使朝鲜文学艺术更加提高了它的战斗的党性和人民性。金日成元帅当时亲手写的“血海”、“庆祝大会”、“城堭堂”等作品，游击队员和人民所唱过的革命歌曲，以及他们跳过的群众舞蹈，成了我国社会主义现实主义艺术发展中的珍贵财产。
    1945年8月15日，伟大的苏军解放朝鲜以后，由于朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府执行正确的文艺政策，我国民族艺术的优秀传统获得了辉煌的发展。这个时期，是朝鲜社会主义民族艺术的发展时代。
    在这个时期内，朝鲜人民传统的爱国主义具有了社会主义的精神，使其成为反对美帝国主义和李承晚卖国集团的强有力的思想武器。
    今天，我们的民族艺术，把社会主义的内容和民族形式结合在一起，在朝鲜劳动党根据列宁的原则制定的文艺政策的指导下，把促进跨上千里马建设社会主义的全民斗争，作为自己的旗帜。
    反映革命斗争和劳动的创作
    朝鲜作家和艺术家们把反映祖国的革命传统看作是自己的神圣义务。特别是用感人的艺术形象来反映金日成元帅领导抗日武装斗争的那些作品，使全体人民更加忠于党和祖国。最近上演的话剧“雪峰山”、歌剧“说吧，密林”等，都是反映我国革命传统的优秀作品。
    同时，社会主义劳动这一主题在我国艺术中也得到了充分的表现。最近上演的话剧“伟大的力量”、“先驱者们”等都非常生动地表现了跨上千里马的建设社会主义的先进工人和农民的形象。
    这些作品，都是用艺术形象描述了社会主义劳动的荣誉和社会主义社会人和人之间的相互关系，并以革命的浪漫主义情调反映了劳动的伟大。
    我国的文学艺术有力地揭露了美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚集团的罪恶和他们的惨无人道的暴行，表现了朝鲜人民为实现祖国的和平统一而进行的神圣斗争。话剧“狼”、艺术影片“怎能分开活下去”等就是关于这个主题的作品。除此以外，还出现了许多揭露美帝暴行、引人注目的造型美术作品。
    在反对美帝国主义者的斗争中，特别是在祖国解放战争中，朝鲜人民发挥的无比的英勇和革命的英雄主义，使以此为主题的朝鲜艺术得到了更进一步的发展。话剧、音乐、舞蹈、美术等许多艺术作品，都表现了如“一二一一高地”、“渔郎川”等英雄高地和难忘的前线的事迹。话剧“李寿福英雄”、舞蹈“我的高地”、交响乐“向胜利前进！”、“为了祖国”、油画“赵玉姬英雄”等许多作品都典型地反映了朝鲜人民的爱国斗争。
    高举国际主义旗帜
    我们的一切胜利，都是在无产阶级国际主义思想的旗帜下，得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国兄弟般的支持、团结和互助而取得的。祖国解放战争的胜利是如此，今天社会主义建设的胜利前进也是如此。国际主义思想成了我们文学艺术的基本特点之一。
    中国人民志愿军的英雄事迹，如用自己的胸膛堵住敌人火口的黄继光英雄、用生命救出朝鲜少年的罗盛教烈士、在敌机的滥炸下为救出朝鲜老大娘而牺牲的王永有烈士，以及上甘岭的英雄们和所有中国人民志愿军官兵们的无产阶级国际主义的伟大精神和不朽功勋，都成为我们文学艺术作品中的高贵的形象和主题。
    我国作家和艺术家们大量地创作了以苏联为首的兄弟国家之间友好团结的歌曲和舞蹈。歌颂朝中友谊的作品有话剧“我们永远战斗在一起”，舞蹈“高地相逢”等。这些话剧和舞蹈歌颂了两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊。
    今天，我国的民族艺术渗透着无产阶级国际主义的精神，而且它已成为争取民族解放斗争的思想武器，成为争取世界和平的武器。
    朝鲜的民族艺术，还在不断地吸取苏联、中国等兄弟国家的良好经验。这样使朝鲜的民族艺术更能迅速发展，放出异采。话剧“克里姆林宫的钟声”（苏联）、“战斗里成长”（中国）、歌剧“伊凡·苏萨宁”（苏联）等许多作品，都已译成朝鲜文并已上演。此外，还有不少兄弟国家的歌曲和舞蹈也在我国演出。
    随着兄弟国家文化交流日益频繁，朝鲜艺术团曾对苏联、中国等兄弟国家进行了友好访问，也曾几次参加世界青年学生联欢节。朝鲜的民族艺术，在这些演出中能够显示出本民族艺术的特点和社会主义制度的优越性，因而它为加强各国家人民之间的友好团结作出了贡献。
    朝鲜艺术团在几次访问中国的时候，演出了朝鲜传统的歌舞、音乐和唱剧，唱剧“春香传”、“沈清传”，歌剧“孔菊与潘菊”，都得到了中国人民的热爱。不仅如此，“春香传”和“沈清传”等剧本，已译成中文，并在中国的舞台上演出。特别是不久以前曾访问过朝鲜的中国人民志愿军文工团同志们从朝鲜带回了不少朝鲜的民谣和舞蹈，而且在北京举行演出。他们深刻地体会到了朝鲜民谣和舞蹈的特点，并巧妙地把它加以形象化。毫无疑问，这是我们两国文化交流事业取得的光辉灿烂的成就之一。
    这次，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团访问中国，演出一些中国歌曲和舞蹈，这不仅在加强兄弟友谊方面有其重要意义，而且通过这些演出，我们学会了很多东西，这对于发展朝鲜的艺术事业有很大的帮助。
    党的思想战线上的近卫队
    现在，我国有一千多名作家、三十多个各种艺术团体，并且在艺术电影制片厂和记录、科学、新闻电影制片厂里工作的，有三千五百多名专职艺术家们。另外，音乐大学、美术大学、作家学院、戏剧学校、电影干部学校、舞蹈学校正在培养几千名青年作家和艺术人材。朝鲜的文学艺术家们分别参加了作家同盟、作曲家同盟、美术同盟以及各剧场等专门机构，他们是朝鲜劳动党在思想战线上的可靠的近卫部队，是贯彻党的文艺政策的坚强战士。
    解放后十多年来，我们的文学艺术有了飞跃发展，取得了巨大的成就。其特点之一，就是在文学艺术方面开展了群众运动。群众文化事业得到了迅速发展，并促使专职文学艺术家们深入劳动群众，接触生活，在群众中发展文学艺术。朝鲜劳动党号召作家和艺术家到人民中去进行工作和学习。他们走上生产岗位，担任工厂、企业的报纸主编或农村俱乐部主任，他们一边工作，一边学习和创作，并指导文艺活动。仅在今年10月就有一百五十名艺术家投到实际生活中去。
    我国社会主义经济已在经济各部门中占有了唯一的统治地位，同时全国又掀起了社会主义建设高潮，这都有利于促使文学艺术的普遍开花。在工矿企业、农业生产合作社、渔村、学校、街道里，已有七万四千多个各种文艺团体，文艺工作者达一百七十多万人。近年来，几次全国性的艺术会演大会所取得的惊人成就，就显示了我国劳动人民的艺术才华是何等的新颖和丰富。
    从下面的数字，我们可以看得出解放后在艺术方面取得的重大成就：各种影片有五百多部，各种戏剧作品有一千三百多部，此外，还有数不尽的歌曲和舞蹈小品。所有这些作品都成为用社会主义爱国主义思想教育人民的强有力的武器。
    党和政府为保证民族艺术的发展，创立了国立民族艺术剧场、国立艺术剧场、舞蹈剧场等，发展了唱剧、歌剧、舞剧、民族管弦乐、民谣等多种多样的艺术形式。从中央到地方，各艺术团体和业余艺术组织都掌握了民族音乐和民族舞蹈。“伽耶琴弹唱”已经在群众中广泛流行，民族舞蹈则已成为劳动人民生活中不可缺少的部分。
    我们的文学艺术，由于对反党的宗派主义和资产阶级文艺思想以及其思想残余展开了尖锐的思想斗争，从而坚守并发展了我们文学艺术的列宁主义原则。金日成元帅经常教导文学艺术工作者要成为党的忠实的思想部队，要忠于马克思列宁主义。最近几年来，当在一些国家里修正主义理论抬头，并企图诬蔑、丑化社会主义现实主义的时候，朝鲜的文学艺术工作者在党的坚强领导下，更高地举起社会主义现实主义旗帜。具有几千年历史的朝鲜艺术，今天正处在前所未有的黄金时代。（附图片）
