Title: The Sunlight Stings Them

The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on several issues concerning people's communes compares our people's communes to the rising sun appearing on the vast horizon of eastern Asia. This is a very accurate and vivid metaphor. The bright sunshine not only gives warmth but also heat and strength to the 650 million people. This rising sun has also won the attention and welcome of friends all over the world.

However, there are also "a bunch of fools" who are stung by this dazzling sunlight. Thus, led by Dulles, a grand chorus of rumors and slanders against the people's commune movement in our country was launched. They snarled, spat, and are still singing to this day.

This chorus, headed by Dulles, lives in a world of dimness, shrouded in layers of dense haze. But now, through this haze, a dazzling red sun has appeared. This red sun shows the further unity and strength of the 650 million people, giving endless encouragement and strength to the vast number of people who are still struggling with food and clothing under capitalist exploitation. At the same time, it also foreshadows the death of this group of "fools." So, in a panic, they all spat at the people's commune movement in our country.

Dulles and his ilk "don't understand anything about our country's affairs" and don't know what a commune looks like at all, but they have the ability to fabricate rumors and distort the truth. They clamor incessantly, saying that the people's communes have abolished individual freedom and family life, as if such propaganda would render the people's communes worthless. Especially on the issue of "family life," Western journalists are making a big fuss with their eyes closed. The people's communes have set up nurseries, which on the one hand ensure that fathers and mothers have no worries and can work with peace of mind; on the other hand, they also enable children to live better and be better educated. The people's communes have set up homes for the elderly (some places call them happiness homes), providing a comfortable and warm home for the elderly without children to rely on. These are all great things that everyone praises and cheers for. But what do Western journalists say? They also rush to publish news about the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," but they dare not tell the truth. The resolution clearly states: "We advocate abolishing the unreasonable patriarchal system left over from history and developing a democratic and united family life. This proposition has been warmly welcomed by the masses. Therefore, in terms of housing construction, attention must be paid to making houses suitable for the reunion of men, women, old and young in each family." But some Western journalists continue to say that the commune "destroys traditional Chinese family life, making husbands and wives live in separate dormitories." Why don't they dare to tell the truth? It is very clear that if they tell the truth, their rumors will all go bankrupt.

Over the years, although this group of "fools" has repeatedly suffered setbacks in the face of historical facts, they have never become slightly more sober. They are always dreaming that socialist countries will encounter some bad luck, even though this dream is destined to fail. But they are always dreaming and constantly barking at the sun. A reporter from United Press International even saw "serious problems and serious doubts" in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," reminding us of the panic and chaos of those bats who dare not see the sun.

We do have difficulties, and many new problems have emerged. Unfortunately, this will not help the rumor-mongering chorus. The rising sun shines brightly. The Chinese people despise difficulties strategically and pay attention to difficulties tactically, which can completely solve all problems and make life better and better. As for Dulles and his gang of rumor-mongering and slandering chorus? Things are very bad, they are in complete darkness, rotting away day by day. Even if they spit out all their saliva, how can they make their fate any better?

Alan Winnington, a correspondent for the British "Daily Worker" stationed in Beijing, challenged those rumor-mongers and invited them to come to China to see the people's communes. This is a good suggestion. It's just that these chorus members may not dare to accept this challenge, because even when they are clamoring, they have a guilty conscience.

    阳光刺痛了他们
    梁汝怀
    党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议把我们的人民公社比作在亚洲东部的广阔的地平线上出现的初升的太阳，这真是非常确切、非常形象化的比喻。阳光灿烂，给予六亿五千万人民的，不仅是温暖，也是热和力量。这个初升的太阳也赢得全世界的朋友们的注视和欢迎。
    但是，也有那么“一大堆蠢人”，被这耀眼的阳光刺痛了。于是，由杜勒斯领衔，对我国的人民公社运动进行了集造谣污蔑之大成的大合唱。呲牙咧嘴，唾沫横飞，唱到现在还没有停。
    以杜勒斯为首的这群合唱团，他们的世界里是暗淡无光的，笼罩在头上的是层层浓密的阴霾。而现在，透过这阴霾，一轮光彩夺目的红日出现了。这轮红日显示了六亿五千万人民的进一步团结和强大，给那些现在还在资本主义压榨下愁吃愁穿的广大人民以无限鼓舞和力量，同时，它也预告了这群“蠢人”们的死亡。于是，他们在惊慌失措之余，便向我国的人民公社运动一起吐唾沫了。
    杜勒斯之流“对于我国的事情，啥也不懂”，根本不知道公社是什么样子，却有颠倒黑白的造谣本领。他们唁唁然叫嚣着，说人民公社已经取消了个人自由和家庭生活，好像这么一宣传，人民公社就一钱不值了。特别是在“家庭生活”这个问题上，西方记者闭起眼睛大做其文章。人民公社办了托儿所，一方面保证了父亲母亲们没有牵挂，安心地劳动；一方面也使孩子们生活得更好，教育得更好。人民公社办了敬老院（有些地方叫幸福院），使无子女依靠的老年人有个舒服温暖的归宿。这些都是人人叫好个个欢呼的大好事。而西方记者们怎么说呢？他们也争先恐后的发布“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的消息，但是他们却不敢说出真话。决议中，明明写着：“我们主张废除历史上遗留下来的不合理的家长制，发展民主团结的家庭生活。这种主张得到群众的热烈欢迎。因此，在住宅建筑方面，必须注意使房屋适宜于每个家庭的男女老幼的团聚。”可是有些西方记者，却继续说什么公社“破坏了传统的中国家庭生活，使丈夫和妻子住在分开的宿舍里”。他们为什么不敢说真话呢？这是很明白的，说了真话，他们的谣言就全部破产了。
    多少年来，尽管这一群“蠢人”们一次又一次地在历史事实面前碰得头破血流，但他们从没有变得稍微清醒些。它们总在梦想着社会主义国家碰上一些倒霉事，尽管这梦想永远要落空。但他们也总是在梦想着，而且在不断地向太阳狂吠。合众国际社记者居然从“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”里看到“发生了严重的问题和严重的疑问”，使我们想到那些不敢见太阳的蝙蝠们的惊慌和混乱。
    困难，我们是有的；新问题，也出现不少。可惜这一点也帮不了造谣合唱团的忙。旭日初升，光芒万丈。中国人民在战略上藐视困难，在战术上又重视困难，这就完全能解决一切问题，把日子过得越来越好。而杜勒斯和他的一伙造谣污蔑的合唱团呢？不妙得很，他们是一片漆黑，一天天在烂下去。纵使他们吐尽了唾沫，又怎么能让自己的命运好一些呢？
    英国“工人日报”驻北京记者阿兰·魏宁顿向那些造谣家挑战，请他们到中国来看一看人民公社，这倒是个好建议。只是这些合唱团团员们未必敢接受这个挑战，因为他们即使在唁唁然的时候，也是作贼心虚的。
