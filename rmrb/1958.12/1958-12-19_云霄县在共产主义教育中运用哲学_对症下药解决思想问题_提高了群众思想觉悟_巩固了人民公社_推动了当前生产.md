According to a report in the Fujian Daily: Yunxiao County, Fujian, after a period of nationwide philosophy study, appropriately applies philosophy in socialist and communist education, achieving "shooting the arrow at the target" and "treating the symptoms." Whatever problems exist, the corresponding philosophical principles are explained, resulting in good effects. The masses can not only deeply understand philosophical principles but also improve their ideological awareness, which plays a significant role in consolidating the people's communes and promoting current production.

After the nationwide philosophy study movement was launched in Yunxiao County, by October, the communes and units had generally completed the study of topics such as what is philosophy, materialism, idealism, the theory of practice, the theory of contradiction, phenomenon and essence, individual and general, and so on. In late October, after the implementation of the grain supply system in Yunxiao County, due to the presence of individualism and departmentalism among some of the masses, erroneous arguments such as "suffering losses" emerged. Based on this situation, the county party committee decided to closely integrate the socialist and communist education movement with the nationwide philosophy study.

Following the instructions of the county party committee, the communes and units closely implemented "taking practice as the guiding principle" in this socialist and communist education movement, achieving "singing the song of the mountain" and addressing the ideological problems of the masses by linking them with reality and extensively discussing philosophical principles. For example, in recent years, due to the rapid development of mutual aid and cooperation and changes in some systems, the masses had doubts such as, "Now there are seventy-two changes a day, I don't know how things will change in the future?" The people's lecturers in the communes specifically elaborated on the topic of "The Goodness of People's Communes and the Beautiful Prospects of Socialist Construction," explaining that as productive forces develop, the relations of production must also develop accordingly. Only when the relations of production adapt to the development of productive forces can society progress faster and socialist life become more beautiful and happy. They pointed out that the transformation from advanced cooperatives to people's communes was to better develop the productive forces. If communes were not established, it would hinder social progress. This made the cadres and masses clear about the dialectical relationship between the relations of production and the productive forces; the People's Commune is the result of the relations of production adapting to the development of the productive forces. After the education, the masses generally improved their understanding. For example, after the implementation of the grain supply system, some people one-sidedly focused on "eating as much as you want" and abandoned "working hard to produce," while others sat and waited for communism to arrive, leading to sluggish production. In response to the above situation, the people's lecturers explained the relationship between production and consumption, specifically clarifying that life is determined by production, and that to improve life, production must first be done well. This enabled the cadres and masses to establish a communist labor perspective and overcome the erroneous ideological understanding of sitting and waiting for communism. Lin Caipu, an old woman from the Haidao Brigade of the Red Flag Commune, was blind, but she still asked her children to take her to the canteen every day to bundle grass. When asked to live in the happiness home, she said, "Everyone is waiting to eat free meals, I don't know when communism will come." Now the phenomenon of sluggish production has been basically eliminated, and everyone is actively engaged in the winter planting campaign.

In the socialist and communist education movement, all communes and units in the county also generally elaborated on the following philosophical principles: To address the ideas of a few people who were content to stay in the middle, they talked about the theory of continuous revolution; To address some "autumn settlement" factions, they spoke about "the relationship between nine fingers and one finger" and "the relationship between subjective initiative and objective possibility," pointing out that the increased production of direct-seeded and densely planted rice this year was the main thing, and the bad aspects were only a few. The reason for the bad aspects, in addition to a lack of experience, was mainly due to the ideological resistance of a few cadres and masses, who treated direct-seeded rice with the attitude of "a stepmother treating a stepdaughter," so field management was not good enough, which affected the increase in production. After this explanation and education, the cadres and masses generally reflected, "This time, we have the capital to fight the settlement faction." For example, in response to the superstitious thinking of some people who still "rely on the heavens for food," and the lack of confidence in high yields, they spoke extensively about materialism and idealism, pointing out the harm of believing in ghosts and gods.

Through the use of philosophical principles to carry out socialist and communist education, the ideological awareness and theoretical level of the cadres and masses in the county have been further improved; the confidence in running people's communes and building socialism has been greatly enhanced.

    云霄县在共产主义教育中运用哲学 
    对症下药解决思想问题
    提高了群众思想觉悟  巩固了人民公社  推动了当前生产
    据福建日报消息：福建云霄县经过全民学哲学，在社会主义教育和共产主义教育中适当地运用哲学，做到“有的放矢”、“对症下药”，存在什么问题就讲什么哲学原理，效果很好，群众既能深入一步领会哲学原理，又提高了思想觉悟，对巩固人民公社和推动当前生产起了很大作用。
    云霄县开展全民学哲学运动后，到10月份，各公社、单位一般都学完了什么叫哲学、唯物主义、唯心主义、实践论、矛盾论、现象和本质、个别和一般等课题。10月下旬，云霄县在实行了粮食供给制后，由于部分群众中还存在个人主义和本位主义，因此就出现了“吃亏论”等等错误论调。县委据此情况，决定把社会主义教育和共产主义教育运动同全民学哲学紧密地结合起来。
    各公社、单位根据县委指示，在这次社会主义、共产主义教育运动中，紧紧贯彻了“以实践为纲”，做到“在什么山唱什么歌”、针对群众思想问题，联系实际，大讲特讲哲学原理。如几年来，由于互助合作的迅速发展和一些制度的改变，群众中存在着这样的疑问：“现在真是一天七十二变，将来不知道要变到怎样？”各公社的人民讲师就在“人民公社好和社会主义建设的美好前景”这一课教育中，具体阐述了生产力发展了，就要求生产关系也跟着发展，只有生产关系适应生产力的发展，社会才能更快的进步，社会主义的生活才能更加美好幸福。指出从高级社又变到人民公社，就是为了更好的发展生产力，如果不建立公社，就会阻碍社会进步。使干部、群众明确了生产关系和生产力的辩证关系；人民办公社是生产关系适应生产力发展的结果。教育后，群众普遍提高了认识。又如实行粮食供给制后，有些人片面地抓住“放开肚皮吃饭”、丢掉了“鼓足干劲生产”，有些人坐等共产主义到来，生产疲塌。针对以上情况，人民讲师就讲生产与消费的关系，具体阐明生活是由生产决定的，生活要提高必须先搞好生产，使干部、群众树立了共产主义劳动观点，克服了坐待共产主义的错误思想认识。红旗社海岛大队老妇女林菜埔双眼失明，但每天都叫小孩子带她到食堂捆草把。叫她去住幸福院，她说，“大家都等着吃闲饭，共产主义不知道什么时候才能到来。”现在生产疲塌现象已基本上被扫除了，大家都积极投入了冬种运动。
    全县各公社和单位在社会主义教育和共产主义教育运动中，还普遍阐述了以下几个哲学原理：针对少数群众中甘居中游等思想，讲不断革命论；针对一些秋后算账派讲“九个指头和一个指头的关系”、“主观能动性和客观可能性的关系”，指出今年水稻直播和密植增产是主要的，不好的只是少数，不好的原因除了缺乏经验外，主要是由于少数干部、群众思想有抵触，以“后娘对待前娘子”的态度来对待水稻直播，因此，田间管理搞得不够好，影响了增产。通过这样讲解、教育后，干部、群众普遍反映：“这次和算账派斗争就有了本钱”。又如针对部分群众还存在的“靠天吃饭”的迷信思想，对高产缺乏信心，就大讲唯物主义、唯心主义，指出迷信鬼、神的危害性。
    通过运用哲学原理进行社会主义、共产主义教育，目前全县干部、群众的思想觉悟和理论水平都有了进一步提高；办人民公社、建设社会主义的信心大大增强。
