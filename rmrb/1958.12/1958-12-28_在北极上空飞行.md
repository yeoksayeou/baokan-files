　　Flying Over the Arctic
　　By our reporter Li Nan

　　There are two flight routes from the Dikson base at the mouth of the Yenisei River to the "North Pole No. 7" ice floe station drifting in the central Arctic region of the Western Hemisphere: One route goes northeast, passing the Chelyuskin Cape, the northernmost point of the Eurasian continent, and then straight to the polar region, across the North Pole, to the ice floe station. The other route goes north by northwest, passing Novaya Zemlya, landing on Franz Josef Land, the northernmost territory of the Soviet Union, and from there passing within three hundred kilometers of the North Pole to reach the ice floe station.

　　At the Dikson Island airport, the cold wind whipped up snow columns, and the chill was bone-piercing. Looking north into the distance by the light of the stars and silver moon, the Arctic Ocean presented a scene of tranquility and somberness. Every hour, the Dikson Radio Center received weather reports from various scientific stations in the Arctic. The lines on the weather map showed that the Arctic storm from west to east was gradually subsiding. We had to take advantage of this period to, as the Arctic workers liked to say, quickly leap forward from the base and directly reach the Arctic "forbidden zone." If we waited for the second storm to rise, we would have to wait at least a week in Dikson.

　　Brave Arctic Aviators

　　After comparative research, Captain Moskalenko, the leader of the Arctic Aviation Detachment, decided to choose the westward route. Two aircraft specially used by the Arctic exploration team were already parked on the takeoff line. It was this type of aircraft that was the powerful weapon for Soviet Arctic workers to conquer the Arctic. Brave Arctic aviators piloted these aircraft in the vast Arctic region, going wherever they needed to go. They went to scout ice conditions and escort convoys; they went to find ice floes and establish scientific stations; they used sleds instead of wheels to land on a pitifully small, uneven piece of ice; they could retrieve instruments that had been laid for one or two years and drifted a thousand nautical miles. When talking about the Arctic Aviation Team, Arctic workers took pride in it as the pride of the motherland and the people. They said that no other country in the world had such an outstanding aviation team, with so many trained pilots who could fly across the Arctic at any time for the sake of science and the interests of the motherland.

　　The older generation of pilots of the Arctic Aviation Team, the Soviet hero Mazuruk, who sent the Babanin expedition team to the Arctic ice floe in 1937, flew us from Moscow to Dikson. Now the task of continuing the flight was handed over to the detachment leader Moskalenko and another Arctic pilot, the Soviet hero Stupishin. The fifty-two-year-old spirited Mazuruk waved to us with a smile as we went to the airport and said, according to the old rules of our Arctic Aviation Team: only welcome, no farewell.

　　The specially modified Ilyushin Il-14 aircraft seemed to have particularly powerful horsepower. After a roar, it plunged into the Arctic night sky. The aircraft did not have the seats of ordinary passenger planes. The inside of the fuselage was covered with a thick woolen cover to ensure that the interior was not invaded by the cold wind. Most of the aircraft's load was spare gasoline, and it also carried strong flares and necessary rescue tools such as tents and food.

　　The route from Dikson to the Franz Josef Islands where the plane was to land was 1,200 kilometers. First under our wings was the Kara Sea, and after passing the northeastern tip of Novaya Zemlya, it was the Barents Sea. The entire Arctic region, the Arctic Ocean and nine seas, covered a total of 18.6 million square kilometers. This is a true kingdom of ice and snow, where solid ice and thick snow dominate such a vast area. Now we are penetrating deeper into this realm of ice and snow. There is no continent or local residents ahead of us, but whether it is Novaya Zemlya, the Franz Josef Islands, or isolated small islands in the vast sea, Arctic workers are steadfastly guarding their posts. They have to spend half a year of dark nights, they have to go through countless winter storms, and now they are guiding our plane to spread its wings forward.

　　Unusual Landing

　　The plane flew over Alexandra Island, the westernmost point of the Franz Josef Islands. The first plane had already landed, but as the second plane we were on approached the brightly lit airport from the darkness, the airport suddenly instructed us not to land. At this time, everyone's calm mood was inevitably questioned: Could it be that the first plane had not landed safely on the runway?

　　The plane circled for an hour, watching the lights on the island gradually approach and then reluctantly move away. We finally learned that the first plane had landed safely. We also knew that this plane was able to land safely only because of the pilots' superb skills and rich experience. The Arctic storm in the past few days had uncovered the runway paved with thick snow, and then covered it with a layer of loose new snow. Although the workers on the island had done their best to clear the runway, it was still difficult for the plane to land. Now, in order to reduce the difficulty for the second plane, clearing work was continuing.

　　The second hour passed again. Taking advantage of the opportunity to circle at low altitude, I looked down from the window for a long time. The two huge icebergs on the island could be vaguely seen. The terrain of the island was higher than the sea surface, so the outline was very clear. The ice floes in this area of the sea were not too thick. The strong winds of the past few days had opened up the ice floes, forming huge cracks, which appeared in deep black color and had not had time to refreeze.

　　The third hour was coming to an end. The plane flew towards the runway with its wings tilted, and after violently shaking a few times on the runway like an untamed wild horse, it finally came to a stop. The pilot Stupishin calmly walked out of the cockpit. His eyes and expression told us that this was not an easy landing to handle.

　　The residence of the aviation station and the meteorological station was a small two-story building. Inside, it was warm and comfortable, forming two different worlds from the outside. After taking off the Arctic winter clothes, drinking a cup of hot tea, I lay down to rest. Outside the window, Arctic workers were still fighting against the wind and snow. The tractors kept roaring, laboriously towing the plane that had sunk into the snow during landing.

　　This archipelago has about one hundred islands of various sizes. Arctic workers chose these islands and established more than one scientific station, observatory, and meteorological station as the last starting base for advancing towards the central Arctic region. The archipelago is the world of polar bears and seagulls. Plants are very sparse on the island except for moss. In the summer, seagulls soar along the ocean, and icebreakers lead convoys through here.

　　Arctic Storm

　　At noon the next day, the moon was shining in the sky, and faint Arctic lights appeared and disappeared from time to time. At this time, the weather station told us that a new storm would come soon. Sure enough, an hour or two later, a violent storm struck the island again. We stood in the storm for a while, and the storm increased the severe cold several times, blowing up snowstorms, stinging our eyes, and blocking our breathing. It is said that if the indigenous people of the Far North encounter a big storm on the way, they can only dig a pit in the snow and hide in it for two days, waiting for the storm to stop before continuing their journey.

　　The Arctic workers on the island continued their work in the storm. We saw the tractor drivers continuing to go to the airport, and the hydrologists driving sleds pulled by five dogs, carrying flares, to retrieve water for testing and analysis. From time to time, the fierce sound of the generator overwhelmed the roar of the storm.

　　Three days and three nights later, this storm finally subsided, but the upper-air meteorological observer at the Seventh Ice Floe Station informed us that there was a strong wind of 100 meters per second at an altitude of 800 meters. We waited until 12 o'clock in the evening before taking off smoothly.

　　After the storm subsided, the sky was very clear. We seemed to have entered a real glass world, with a solemn and tranquil atmosphere in the sky and on the sea. The plane chose the most suitable airflow to move forward, going up and down, sometimes seeming to be only a few tens of meters away from the ice floe. Here, everything seemed to be still, all solidified. On a large ice sheet, scattered ice piles, like ancient fortresses, often appeared under the wings. Judging from the vibration of the plane, the wind must be very strong. Under the strong wind, this seemingly calm ice sheet was drifting and moving within a range of hundreds or thousands of kilometers.

　　The plane jolted more and more violently, and we were getting closer to the heart of the Arctic, the area known as difficult to reach. Suddenly, bursts of clouds rushed in, as if pushing the plane down a few meters. Rise again, and fall again. Arctic pilots often complete their tasks in such variable climatic conditions.

　　Arrived at the Ice Floe Station

　　When the navigator came out of the cockpit to inform everyone that we were already above the ice floe station, we were all exhausted. The navigator's appearance immediately cheered everyone up. "Ice floe station!" A few minutes later, someone in the cabin first discovered the flickering lights in the distance and shouted. Everyone immediately gathered on the side where he was and looked out the window. The lights became clearer and clearer. The red and green lights on the runway were very clear. The ice floe station had notified the wind force and the angle of the runway. The plane quickly landed on the ice floe.

　　This is the latest Soviet ice floe station. When we arrived, it had drifted to 86 degrees 38 minutes north latitude and 296 degrees 36 minutes west longitude, closest to the Greenland-Canadian coast. This ice floe has lost half of its size after drifting for more than a year. It is about one kilometer long and less than one kilometer wide, and the runway is only a few hundred meters long. However, our pilots found this ice floe without any error and landed completely accurately.

　　After circling at the ice floe station for four days, we continued our journey. Now we were going to cross the North Pole and return to the mainland of the Eastern Hemisphere. One hour after taking off from the ice floe station, we reached the sky above the pole. For the convenience of observation, I specially went into the cockpit. The pilot turned on all the lights on the wings, nose, and landing gear, and circled low above the pole as if to commemorate this voyage.

　　Crossing the North Pole

　　Below was an ice sheet. At this moment, it was hard to believe that we were flying over the meridian's starting point, above the earth's axis. The moonlight was so bright, and the sky was extraordinarily clean. Such a sky and moonlight can probably only be seen in the Arctic region. All the stars were concentrated overhead, and seemed to be in the low sky. Looking up from the cockpit, you could see the North Star, so close and so easy to find. Except for the top of the sky, the surrounding sky seemed much darker. All these scenes show that we were moving forward across the pole.

　　A few minutes ago, we were flying north, but after crossing the pole, although the plane maintained its original direction, we were flying south, because starting from the North Pole, any direction is south.

　　More than three hours later, we reached the sky above the Sixth Ice Floe Station, from which we obtained the climatic conditions in this area. After a few more hours, we returned to the Chelyuskin airport on the mainland.

　　We flew for a total of fifteen hours. This is the closest route between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. On this route, there are two Soviet ice floe stations, many automatic stations, and numerous observation stations on the islands and along the mainland coast. These scientific stations make the weather conditions in the ever-changing Arctic region completely understood. Our flight situation proves that this is a safe and fast route, and this is the route for the Soviet people to conquer the Arctic. (Attached picture)

    在北极上空飞行
    本报记者  李楠
    从叶尼塞河口的迪克森基地出发到达正在西半球北极中心地区漂流地“北极七号”浮冰站有两条飞行路线：一条是先向东北，经过欧亚大陆的最北端契留斯金海湾，然后直趋极区，翻过北极，到达浮冰站。另一条是向北偏西飞行，经过新地岛，在苏联最北的领土佛兰兹、约塞夫岛降落，从这里经过离北极三百多公里的地方到达浮冰站。
    在迪克森岛的机场上，冷风卷起雪柱，寒气逼人。借着群星和银月的光辉向北遥望，北极海洋一片宁静阴森气象。迪克森无线电中心每经过一小时都收到从北极各个科学站来的气象报告。气象图上的线路显示出从西向东的北极暴风正在逐渐平息。我们必须趁这段时间，像北极工作者所爱说的一样，从基地迅速向前一跃，直达北极“禁区”。如果等第二场风暴起来之后，那就起码得在迪克森等待一个星期了。
      英勇的北极航空员
    经过比较研究，北极航空支队莫斯卡林科队长决定选择向西的航路。两架北极勘察队专用的飞机已经停在起机线上。正是这种飞机是苏联北极工作者们征服北极的有力武器。英勇的北极航空员们驾驶着这种飞机在海阔天空的北极地区，无所不往。他们去侦查冰情，护送船队航行；他们去寻找浮冰，建立科学站；他们用雪橇代替轮子，在一块小得可怜的不平的冰块上降落；他们可以找回已经敷设了一、二年，漂流上一千海里的仪器。谈起北极航空队来，北极工作者们都引以为祖国和人民的骄傲，他们说，世界上没有任何其他国家有这样卓越的航空队，有这么多经过锻炼的飞行员，他们可以随时为了科学和祖国的利益飞越北极。
    北极航空队的老一代飞行员，1937年把巴巴宁探险队送上北极浮冰的苏联英雄马茹鲁克把我们从莫斯科载到迪克森。现在继续飞行的任务交给支队长莫斯卡林科和另一位北极飞行员、苏联英雄斯图比申。五十二岁的神采奕奕的马茹鲁克在我们去机场时和我们含笑招手，并且说，照我们北极航空队的老规矩：只欢迎，不道别。
    经过专门改装的伊尔十四式飞机似乎马力特别强大，一阵怒号之后，冲入北极夜空。飞机没有普通客机的座位。舱内机身套上了一层厚呢做成的套子，保证内部不为寒风侵袭。飞机大部分载重量载了备用汽油，还携带了强烈的照明弹和必要的帐篷、粮食等类救护工具。
    从迪克森到飞机要降落的佛兰兹、约塞夫群岛有一千二百公里的航路。首先在我们机翼下的是喀拉海，过了新地岛的东北端之后，就是巴伦支海。整个北极地区，北冰洋和九个海共占了一千八百六十万平方公里。这里是真正的冰雪的国度，坚冰和厚雪霸占了这么广大的地区。现在我们就正在深入这个冰雪的领域。在我们前面已经没有大陆，没有当地居民，但无论是新地岛，无论是佛兰兹、约塞夫群岛，或者是茫茫大海中的孤零小岛，北极工作者们都正在坚守着自己的岗位，他们要度过半年的黯黑长夜，他们要经过无数的冬季风暴，现在正是他们引导着我们的飞机展翅前进。
        不寻常的降落
    飞机飞临佛兰兹、约塞夫群岛最西端的亚历山德拉岛。第一架飞机已经降落，但当我们所在的第二架飞机从黑暗中向着灯火明亮的机场前进时，突然机场指示我们不要降落。这时，大家宁静的心情不免起了疑问：难道第一架飞机没有安全降落在跑道上么。
    飞机盘旋了一个小时，一次又一次地看着岛上的灯光逐渐接近，又令人难舍地远远离去。我们终于知道，第一架飞机已经安全降落。我们还知道这架飞机能够安全降落仅仅是由于驾驶员们的高超技术和丰富经验。几天来的北极暴风掀开了用厚雪铺成的跑道，接着又盖上一层松软的新雪。虽然岛上的工作者们已经竭尽全力整理跑道，但飞机着陆仍然不免困难。现在为了减轻第二架飞机的困难，正在继续进行整理工作。
    第二个小时又过去了。我借着不断在低空盘旋的机会久久地从窗口俯视。岛上的两座巨大冰山隐约可以看见。岛的地形比海洋面高，因而轮廓显得很清晰。这一带洋面上的浮冰还不是太厚。几天狂风吹开了浮冰，形成巨大的裂口，裂口呈现深黑的颜色，还没有来得及重新冻合起来。
    第三个小时又快结束。飞机侧着翅膀向跑道飞去，像难羁的野马一样，在跑道上猛烈震动了几下以后，终于静止了下来。驾驶员斯图比申冷静地走出驾驶室，他的眼光和神情告诉我们，这并不是一次操纵容易的降落。
    航空站和气象站的住址是一座不大的两层楼房。入内温暖舒适，和房外顿成两个境界。脱下北极冬装，喝了一杯热茶，躺下来休息。窗外，北极工作者们还在和风雪苦斗，拖拉机不断轰鸣，在费力地曳引降落时陷在雪地里去了的飞机。
    这个群岛共有大小岛屿一百来个。北极工作者们选择这群岛屿，建立了不止一个科学站、天文台和气象站，作为向北极中央地区进军的最后一个出发基地。群岛是白熊和海鸥的世界。岛上除了青苔外，植物非常稀少。夏天，海鸥沿着海洋翱翔，破冰船带领着船队在这里通过。
            北极暴风
    第二天中午，月亮正在天空辉耀，淡薄的北极光时隐时现。就在这个时候，气象台告诉我们，马上就会有新的暴风。果然一两小时后，猛烈的暴风又向岛上袭来了。我们在暴风中站立了一下，暴风把严寒增加了几倍，刮起雪阵，刺痛眼睛，阻塞呼吸。据说，极北大陆的土著居民如果在途中遇到大暴风，只有在雪地挖一个坑，在里面躲避两天，等暴风停息再继续途程。
    岛上的北极工作者们在暴风中仍然继续着自己的工作。我们看见拖拉机手继续到机场去，水文工作者驾着五条狗拉的雪橇，带着照明弹，取回水来，试验分析。时时传来发电机猛烈的声音压倒了暴风的怒吼。
    三天三夜以后，这次暴风才告平息，但第七浮冰站的高空气象观察员通知我们，在八百公尺的空中有每秒一百公尺的大风。我们一直等到晚上十二点钟，才顺利起飞。
    暴风停息之后，天空非常皎洁。我们像是进入了真正的琉璃世界，天上洋上都是一派庄严宁静的气象。飞机选择最适合的气流前进，忽上忽下，有时似乎只离浮冰几十公尺。这里似乎一切都是静止，都已凝结，在一大片冰原上，零乱的冰垒像古代的战堡一样，常常出现在机翼下面。从飞机的震荡判断，风力一定很大。在强大的风力下，这看来宁静的冰原正在几百公里几千公里的范围内漂流移动。
    飞机簸动得越来越巨烈，我们是更接近被称为难于到达的地区北极心脏地带了。突然有一阵阵的云层扑来，像把飞机一下压落了几公尺。再度腾起，又再度低落。北极飞行员们就是经常在这样多变的气候条件下去完成任务的。
        飞到了浮冰站
    等到领航员从驾驶室出来通知大家说已经在浮冰站上空，我们都已疲倦不堪了。领航员的出现立刻振奋了大家的情绪。“浮冰站！”几分钟后机舱里有人首先发现远处闪烁的灯火，喊叫起来。大家立刻集中在他所在的一方，在机窗上瞻望。灯光越来越清晰了。跑道上的红绿灯非常清楚。浮冰站已经通知了风力和跑道的角度。飞机迅速地降落在浮冰上面。
    这就是苏联最新的一个浮冰站。在我们到来的时候，漂到了北纬八十六度三十八分，西经二百九十六度三十六分，离格陵兰加拿大海岸最近。这块浮冰漂流一年多来已损失了一半，长约一公里，宽不到一公里，跑道只有几百公尺。但是，我们的驾驶员们毫无误差地找到这块浮冰，完全准确地降落了。
    在浮冰站上盘旋了四天，我们又继续着自己的旅途。现在我们要穿过北极点，返回东半球大陆。从浮冰站起飞一小时后就到达了极点上空。为了便于了望，我特地走进驾驶室去，驾驶员开了机翼机头和起落架上的全部灯光，像是纪念这次航行似地，在极点上空低低盘旋飞了一圈。穿过北极点
    下面是一片冰原。在这一刹那间，很难令人相信我们正在子午线的起点，在地轴上空飞翔。月色是那样的明亮，天空是出奇的净洁。这样的天空和月色大概只有北极地区才能看到。星星全部集中在头顶，而且似乎就在低空。从驾驶室里一抬头，就可以看到北极星，那么近，那么容易找到。除了顶空而外，四周天际倒是显得黑暗得多。这一切景象都说明我们正在穿过极点前进。
    在几分钟前，我们是向北飞行，但是穿过极点以后，虽然飞机仍然保持原来的方向，而我们却是向南飞行了，因为从北极点出发，向任何一方都是南方。
    三小时多，我们到达了第六浮冰站的上空，从这里获得了这一带的气候情况。又经过几小时后，回到了大陆契留斯金机场。
    我们总共飞行了十五个小时，这是东西两半球的最近的航路，在这条航路上有苏联的两个浮冰站，许多自动站，以及在岛屿和大陆沿岸的众多的观测站。这些科学站使瞬息多变的北极地区的气象完全了如指掌。我们的飞行情况证明，这是一条安全迅速的航路，这是苏联人民征服北极的航路。（附图片）
