Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 28th -- According to a TASS report from Berlin: The socialist transformation of agriculture in the German Democratic Republic has achieved new and significant successes this year. From January to November this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide increased by approximately 50%. Currently, the land cultivated by cooperatives accounts for 36.3% of the country's total arable land, compared to 25.2% at the beginning of the year.

In 1958, the level of mechanization in the cultivation and harvesting work of agricultural production cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic was greatly improved. For example, the level of mechanization in the cultivation of sugar beets and corn reached 98% and 68% respectively, and the level of mechanization in potato harvesting reached 71%.

Currently, there are more than 38,000 machines in the country's machine tractor stations. During the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the state allocated 5.9 billion marks to further consolidate the material and technical foundation of the machine tractor stations.

    民主德国农业合作化迅速发展
    社会主义成分大大增加
    新华社28日讯  据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国的农业的社会主义改造在今年中取得了新的巨大成就。从今年1月到11月，全国的农业生产合作社的数量约增加了50％。现在，合作社耕种的土地面积已经占全国耕地面积的36.3％，而今年年初是25.2％。
    1958年，民主德国农业生产合作社的耕作和收割工作的机械化程度大大提高了。例如，甜菜和玉蜀黍的耕作的机械化程度分别达到了98％和68％，马铃薯的收获工作的机械化程度达到了71％。
    目前全国机器拖拉机站共拥有三万八千多台机器。在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间，国家曾拨出了五十九亿马克的资金，来进一步巩固机器拖拉机站的物质技术基础。
