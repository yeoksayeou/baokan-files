Peaceful Competition, Socialism Will Win
In the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism, socialism will surely surpass capitalism.
                         --Communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    In the past year, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become even stronger, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are getting better day by day." In the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries, facts have proven that socialist countries are developing their national economies at a much faster pace than capitalist countries. Facts will also prove that the period of leaving capitalist countries behind is not too far away.

    Socialist Countries Leap Forward
    In 1958, the share of the socialist camp's industrial output in the world's total industrial output increased from about 33% last year to 38% to 40%. The socialist camp's coal production accounts for 38% of the world's total, steel and iron account for more than 25%, cotton accounts for 33%, and electricity and cement account for 20%. In the first three quarters of this year, the Soviet Union and socialist countries have victoriously completed their economic plans, and their industrial production has increased by 9% to 34%, or even about 70%, compared with the same period last year. At present, workers in industrial enterprises across the Soviet Union have successively completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. The Soviet Union has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture, with the state purchasing more than 1.3 billion poods more grain than last year. China's economic construction is also developing at an unprecedented speed. This year, China created the unprecedented miracle of doubling the total output of steel and grain. On December 3 this year, Korea's industrial sector completed its annual gross industrial output value plan ahead of schedule, exceeding last year by 18%. Most of Vietnam's state-owned factories and mines overfulfilled their third-quarter plans. Mongolia's industrial output in the first three quarters fulfilled 101.5% of the planned target. In the first nine months of this year, industrial production in the German Democratic Republic increased by more than 11% compared with the same period last year, almost doubling the original state plan. In agriculture, the German Democratic Republic also achieved a bumper harvest. According to preliminary estimates, the country's grain harvest this year will increase by about 700,000 tons compared with last year. Comparing the first three quarters of this year with the same period last year, Poland's industrial production increased by 9%, Czechoslovakia increased by 11% (half-year figures), Hungary's average daily industrial output increased by 18% compared with the same period last year, Romania increased by 9.5% (full-year figures), Bulgaria increased by 17%, and Albania's industrial output in the first ten months of this year increased by 24.2% compared with the same period last year (full-year figures).

    At a time when the economies of socialist countries are booming, the Soviet Union proposed a seven-year plan for developing the national economy more rapidly towards communism in November. The successful completion of this plan will undoubtedly greatly change the balance of world power and greatly benefit the cause of peace and socialism for mankind. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party also put forward a magnificent economic leap forward plan for 1959. Korea will also catch up with Japan next year in terms of the output of major industrial products per capita. The German Democratic Republic also put forward the glorious task of "fighting hard for 1,200 days to surpass West Germany in terms of per capita consumption level." Socialist countries are all heading towards the competition goal with full confidence, striving for victory.

    Sharp Contrast
    In terms of the speed of economic development, socialism is much faster than capitalism. Comparing the first half of 1958 with the first half of 1957, the socialist countries increased pig iron by 9%, steel by 10%, coal by 11%, and oil by 15%. All aspects are growing; while capitalist countries have all shrunk, such as pig iron production reduced by 19.6%, steel production reduced by 19.5%, coal production reduced by 9.1%, and oil production reduced by 1.8%. The contrast between the increase and decrease of both sides is extremely clear.

    Looking at the production situation in the Soviet Union and the United States, the output of some major heavy industrial products in the Soviet Union has exceeded or approached that of the United States, while others have narrowed the original distance. In the first half of this year, the United States produced 189 million tons of coal, while the Soviet Union produced 245 million tons of coal, exceeding the United States by 56 million tons. In the first nine months of this year, the United States produced 39.55 million tons of pig iron, while the Soviet Union produced 29.1 million tons, which is quite close. This year, the United States' steel production is estimated to be 84 million tons, while the Soviet Union's is 55 million tons, equivalent to 78.9% of the United States' steel production. In the first half of this year, the Soviet Union's per capita output of industrial products such as peat, nickel, chromium, manganese, combine harvesters, and sugar has exceeded that of the United States, and woolen fabrics and cement will soon catch up with the United States.

    In agriculture, the United States' wheat production this year was 77.3 billion catties, while the Soviet Union's was twice that of the United States. The Soviet Union's sugar beet harvest this year was more than twice that of the United States, and the Soviet Union's production of other crops such as barley, rye, potatoes, and flax also exceeded that of the United States.

    In addition, Korea has surpassed Japan in terms of per capita output of cement and coal; in Europe, countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have also achieved development speeds in peaceful competition that are incomparable to the West.

    Capitalist Crisis Deepening
    Contrary to the prosperous development of the socialist camp's economy, the capitalist economic crisis continues to deepen.

    The US economic crisis that broke out in August last year was the most severe since the war. By April of this year, US industrial production had fallen by 14.3% from the post-war peak in December 1956. The operating rates of important industrial sectors such as steel and automobiles have fallen below 50%. Due to the US government's use of large increases in spending to stimulate the economy, industrial production has rebounded recently, but the operating rates of various enterprises are still only 75%. At the same time, fixed capital investment, which has a decisive impact on the economy, is still shrinking, and unemployment is still serious. Due to large increases in government spending, the deficit in the current fiscal year is as high as 12.2 billion US dollars, creating a serious financial crisis. All of this has cast a heavy shadow on the US economic outlook.

    This spring, the overall industrial production in Western Europe also declined. The industrial production in the Netherlands in the first quarter of this year decreased by 1% compared with the same period last year, Denmark decreased by 2%, British industry, which has been unable to rise for three years, decreased by another 4%, Norway decreased by 5%, Finland decreased by 9%, and West Germany, Austria, and Italy also gradually stagnated. In the third quarter of this year, industrial production in West Germany and France also continued to decline. The surplus and reduction of coal and steel, the lack of industrial operating rates, the difficulty of exports, the increase in unemployment, and the reduction of corporate investment have become common phenomena in Western European capitalist countries.

    In order to shift the crisis, European and American capitalist countries have stepped up their attacks on the lives of domestic working people and underdeveloped countries. The United States has tried its best to depress raw material prices and implement a "sell more, buy less" dumping policy, which has caused underdeveloped countries to generally fall into a situation of rapidly increasing trade deficits and depleted foreign exchange. In 1957 alone, they lost 4 billion US dollars in trade income due to the decline in raw material prices. At the recent Seattle Colombo Plan Organization meeting and the Americas "Twenty-One Nation Committee" meeting, Southeast Asian and Latin American countries expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the United States' shifting of the crisis.

    In the face of the overwhelming peaceful economic competition, the United States and other Western countries have appeared in chaos, wailing, and fear. (Attached picture)

    和平竞赛  社会主义必胜
    在社会主义同资本主义的和平竞赛中，社会主义必将胜过资本主义。
                         ——中共八届六中全会公报
    在过去一年中，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加壮大了，正如毛主席所指出的：“我们一天天好起来”。在同资本主义国家进行的和平经济竞赛中，事实证明，社会主义国家在发展国民经济方面速度是大大超过资本主义国家的。事实也必将证明，把资本主义国家丢在后面的时期也已不太远了。
    社会主义各国跃进
    1958年，社会主义阵营工业产量在世界工业总产量中所占份额，已由去年的33％左右提高到38％到40％。社会主义阵营的煤产量已占世界总产量的38％，钢和铁占25％以上，棉花占33％，电力和水泥已占到20％。在今年的头三个季度中，苏联和社会主义国家都已胜利地完成了经济计划，他们的工业生产比去年同一时期分别增加达9％到34％，甚至70％左右。目前，苏联各地工业企业的工人已纷纷提前完成了今年全年的生产计划。苏联在农业上获得空前大丰收，国家收购的粮食比去年多十三亿多普特。我国的经济建设也在以空前速度向前发展。今年，我国创造了钢和粮食总产量翻一番的史无前例的奇迹。朝鲜的工业部门已在今年12月3日提前完成了今年的工业总产值计划，超过去年18％。越南大多数国营厂矿超额完成了第三季度计划。蒙古工业头三季完成预定计划的101.5％。民主德国在今年头九个月里的工业产量比去年同期增长达11％以上，比国家原定计划几乎增加了一倍。在农业方面，民主德国也获得丰收，据初步估计，今年全国谷物的收获量大约将比去年增加七十万吨。以今年前三个季度同去年同期比较，波兰的工业生产增加9％，捷克斯洛伐克增加11％（为半年数字），匈牙利工业平均日产量比去年同期增加了18％，罗马尼亚增加9.5％（为全年数字），保加利亚增加17％，阿尔巴尼亚今年头十个月的工业产量比去年同期增加24.2％（为全年数字）。
    在社会主义国家经济蓬勃发展的时候，苏联于11月提出了更迅速地向共产主义迈进的发展国民经济七年计划。这个计划的胜利完成，无疑将更要大大地改变世界力量的对比，大大有利于人类的和平和社会主义事业。我国党的八届六中全会也提出了1959年宏伟的经济跃进计划。朝鲜也将于明年在按人口平均计算的主要工业品产量方面赶上日本。民主德国也提出要“奋战一千二百天在按人口计算的消费水平方面超过西德”的光荣任务。社会主义国家都在信心百倍地奔向竞赛目标，争取胜利。
    鲜明的对比
    在经济发展的速度上，社会主义大大快于资本主义。以1958年上半年同1957年上半年相比，社会主义各国生铁增加9％，钢增加10％，煤增加11％，石油增加15％，各个方面都在增长；而资本主义国家则均有缩减，如生铁减产19.6％，钢减产19.5％，煤减产9.1％，石油减产1.8％。双方增减对比亟为鲜明。
    以苏联和美国的生产情况来看，一些主要重工业产品产量苏联已经超过或接近美国，另一些则已缩短了原有的距离。今年上半年美国产煤一亿八千九百万吨，苏联产煤二亿四千五百万吨，超过美国达五千六百万吨。今年头九个月美国生铁产量为三千九百五十五万吨，苏联则为二千九百一十万吨，已经相当接近。今年美国钢产量估计为八千四百万吨，苏联则为五千五百万吨，相当于美国钢产量的78.9％。今年上半年，苏联在泥炭、镍、铬、锰、联合收割机、糖等工业产品按人口平均的产量都已超过美国，毛织品和水泥也将很快赶上美国。
    在农业方面，美国今年小麦产量为七百七十三亿斤，苏联为美国的两倍。苏联今年甜菜收获量为美国的两倍多，其他如大麦、黑麦、马铃薯、亚麻，苏联的产量均超过美国。
    另外，在按人口平均计算的水泥和煤产量方面，朝鲜已超过日本；在欧洲，民主德国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克等国也都在和平竞赛中取得了西方所不能比拟的发展速度。
    资本主义危机深重
    与社会主义阵营经济的繁荣发展相反，资本主义经济危机继续加深。
    去年8月爆发的美国经济危机是战后最厉害的一次。至今年4月，美国工业生产已比1956年12月的战后最高峰下降了14.3％。钢铁和汽车等重要工业部门的开工率都降到50％以下。由于美国政府用大量增加开支来刺激经济，最近工业生产有所回升，但是各企业的开工率目前仍只有75％。同时，对经济有着决定性影响的企业固定资本投资仍然萎缩，失业情况仍然严重。由于大量增加政府开支，本财政年度赤字高达一百二十二亿美元，造成了严重的财政危机。这都使美国经济前景蒙上了重重的阴影。
    今春，西欧总的工业生产也出现了下降。荷兰的工业生产今年第一季比去年同期减少了1％，丹麦减少2％，三年来一直无法上升的英国工业又减少了4％，挪威减少5％，芬兰减少9％，西德、奥地利和意大利也逐渐走向停滞。今年第三季度，西德、法国的工业生产也接着下降。煤、钢的过剩和减产，工业开工率的不足，出口的困难，失业的增加，企业投资的减缩，已成为资本主义西欧各国的普遍现象。
    欧美资本主义国家为了转嫁危机，加紧向国内劳动人民的生活和不发达国家发动进攻。美国竭力压低原料价格、实行“多卖少买”的倾销政策，已使不发达国家普遍陷入贸易逆差激增、外汇枯竭的境地。仅在1957年一年，它们因原料价格下跌就损失了四十亿美元的贸易收入，在最近举行的西雅图科伦坡计划组织会议和美洲“二十一国委员会”会议上，都反映了东南亚和拉丁美洲国家对美国转嫁危机的极度不满。
    在声势逼人的和平经济竞赛面前，美国和其他西方国家出现了一片混乱、哀鸣和恐惧。（附图片）
