Qinnong Commune Dining Hall Plans for Grain and Vegetable Consumption

(Our Dispatch) The Qinnong People's Commune in Fumin County, Yunnan Province, has stipulated that the commune's Finance and Grain Department will uniformly allocate grain to the dining halls each month according to standards, changing the previous chaotic situation of eating first and calculating later. In accordance with the principle of gradually improving the nutritional intake of commune members, it also stipulates that each dining hall should mix staple grains with coarse grains and plant vegetables and establish pig farms according to the population ratio.

According to the plan, the commune has given part of this year's harvested sweet potatoes and 200,000 jin of soybeans left over after completing the state's unified purchase task to the dining halls. Each dining hall has also reclaimed vegetable plots according to the plan, planting one mu of vegetable garden for every seventy people, and planted 8,000 mu of rapeseed. In addition, according to the plan's requirement of raising one pig for every ten people, more than 2,000 pigs are now being raised, and preparations are being made to raise more than 60,000 chickens and establish some pickle workshops. In this way, next year it can be guaranteed that each person will eat an average of two jin of vegetables per day, three times more than now; there will also be an increase in vegetable oil, and dozens of jin of meat can be supplied to commune members throughout the year. From December this year, one vegetable and one soup will be increased to two vegetables and one soup per meal, and meat will be eaten three times a month.

    勤劳公社食堂用粮吃菜有计划
    本报讯  云南省富民县勤劳人民公社，规定每月由公社财粮部按照标准把粮食统一拨给食堂，改变过去吃了再算的混乱现象。按照逐步改善社员食物营养的原则，并规定了各个食堂主粮搭配杂粮，和按人口比例种植蔬菜、建立生猪饲养场。
    根据计划，公社把今年收获的部分红薯，和完成国家统购任务后留下的二十万斤黄豆都给了食堂。各个食堂也按照计划，按七十个人种一亩菜地的比例，开垦了菜地，种了八千亩菜籽。另外，根据计划每十个人养一头猪的要求，现在养了二千多头，还准备养六万多只鸡和成立一些腌菜房。这样，明年一年可以保证每人每天平均吃到二斤蔬菜，比现在增加三倍；植物油也有增加，一年中可以供给社员数十斤肉。从今年12月份起，每顿一菜一汤增加到二菜一汤，一个月吃三次肉。
