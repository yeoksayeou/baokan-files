    The People's Struggle Will Surely Triumph
    Heda's Speech at the Capital's Grand Rally Welcoming Algerian Guests
    Mr. Burhan, Vice-Chairman,
    Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice-Premier,
    Comrades, dear friends:
    Being with you fills us with great joy and excitement, and even the most carefully chosen words cannot express all that we feel.
    The warm welcome and honor bestowed upon us by the Chinese Government and the Chinese people at the Beijing airport are deeply imprinted in our hearts. When we saw our national flag and the flag of the great People's Republic of China flying high together, when we heard our national anthem and the anthem of the great People's Republic of China played together, these moments and our feelings were indescribable, and they will forever be etched in our memories. The enthusiasm with which you receive us today deeply moves us.
    We express our deep gratitude to you on behalf of our people who are struggling for their independence and freedom, and on behalf of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria.
    We will truthfully convey to our people all the respect and care you have shown us, for which they will thank you, because through us, you are showing respect to them. This sincere friendship of yours is a friendship you are showing to the Algerian people. The Algerian people will always remember it in their hearts.
    This friendship makes us very happy, but it does not surprise us. For we have long known with what sympathy you have watched our struggle. We have long known your moral support for us. The Chinese government's prompt recognition of our government is proof of this. This swift act of recognition has encouraged our people, and it has also encouraged our National Liberation Army.
    This friendship does not surprise us, because we have long known that the Chinese people stand at the forefront of the anti-colonialist struggle and have been fighting for world freedom and peace. The Algerian people are today waging a great struggle for their own liberation. They are fighting for freedom. And freedom and peace are indivisible.
    This friendship does not surprise us, also because we know that the Chinese people are one of the great formulators of the Bandung principles, and they are the standard-bearers of Asian-African people's solidarity.
    Dear friends,
    We salute the Chinese people and their heroic leaders, who, under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, continue to wage the struggle against imperialism for the complete liberation of China, and lead the people forward on the road of construction, industrialization and progress.
    The atmosphere of warmth and trust we have encountered here makes us believe that we have reason to think that everything connects us, everything brings us closer together. Our past and present, our suffering and anti-imperialist struggle, our common love for freedom and peace, all this is enough to strengthen our friendship. We must also say that in today's world, our interests are common.
    We have absolute confidence in the victory of our struggle. The Algerian people rely first and foremost on themselves, on their unwavering will to achieve liberation, on their patriotism, on their spirit of sacrificing everything to defeat colonialism.
    The Algerian people also rely on the support of all peoples who oppose colonialism, especially the peoples of Asia and Africa.
    Because we believe in the precious role of man, we will surely be victorious with the support of six hundred million Chinese people. Because we believe in the precious role of man, we will surely be victorious with the support of two-thirds of humanity.
    For this reason, we are not afraid of the material strength and enormous support that France has obtained from its allies, especially the United States.
    France is waging a war of extermination in Algeria, and French troops do not hesitate to carry out massacres, arson, rape, and plunder. Women, children, and the elderly have been slaughtered indiscriminately.
    But the Algerian people will surely triumph, because their cause is just, because they stand on the side of progressive forces, while colonialism is weakening and is doomed to die. Colonialism is in its death throes. The Algerian people are delivering the final blow.
    The final struggles of French colonialism threaten world peace, as evidenced by its invasion of Suez in 1956, its constant invasions of Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya, and its inspection of ships of many countries on the high seas.
    The Algerian war is a war for freedom against oppression. The victory of the Algerian people will be a victory for freedom. All peace-loving, freedom-loving, and progressive people declare to the world that they stand in solidarity with the Algerian people. Therefore, the victory of the Algerian people will also be their victory.
    These people should show the imperialist forces that their unity is not an empty word and cannot be ignored. The freedom and independence of all nations should force imperialism to accept.
    As for the Algerian people, they are willing to end the war through negotiations. But as long as their rights are not recognized, they are determined to fight to the end for freedom and national independence.
    We thank the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity for giving us this opportunity to speak to the Chinese people.
    Long live the heroic people of the great People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Algerian people who are fighting for independence!
    Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples!
    Long live world peace!

    人民的斗争必将胜利
    赫达在首都欢迎阿尔及利亚贵宾大会上的讲话
    包尔汉副主席先生，
    副总理彭德怀元帅先生，
    同志们，亲爱的朋友们：
    和你们在一起，使我们感到非常高兴和兴奋，即使是最精心挑选的词句也无法表达我们所感受的一切。
    中国政府和中国人民在北京机场所给予我们的热情欢迎和荣誉深深地印在我们的心里。当看到我国国旗和伟大的中华人民共和国的国旗高高飘扬在一起，当听到我国国歌和伟大的中华人民共和国的国歌一同演奏时，这种时刻和我们的心情是无法描述的，它们将永远铭刻在我们的记忆里。今天你们接待我们的热情使我们十分感动。
    我们代表正在为自己的独立和自由而斗争的我国人民和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府向你们表示深深的谢意。
    我们将如实地把你们所给予我们的一切敬意和关怀转告给我国人民，他们将因此而感谢你们，因为通过我们，你们是在向他们表示敬意。你们对我们的这种诚挚的友谊，也就是你们对阿尔及利亚人民表示的友谊。阿尔及利亚人民将永远把它记在心里。
    这种友谊使我们十分欢欣，但是并不教我们感到惊奇。因为我们早就知道你们以怎样的同情注视着我们的斗争。我们早就知道你们对我们的道义支持。中国政府这样迅速地承认我国政府，就是证明。这个迅速承认的行动鼓舞了我国人民，它也鼓舞了我们的民族解放军。
  这种友谊没有教我们感到惊奇，因为我们早就知道中国人民站在反殖民主义斗争的最前线，并且一直在为世界自由和和平而战斗。阿尔及利亚人民今天在为自己的解放进行着巨大的斗争。他们在为自由而战斗。而自由与和平是不可分割的。
    这种友谊没有教我们感到惊奇，还因为我们知道中国人民是万隆原则的伟大制订人之一，他们是亚非人民团结的旗手。
    亲爱的朋友们，
    我们向中国人民和他们的英勇的领导人致敬，他们在毛泽东主席的光辉领导下，继续为彻底解放中国而进行反对帝国主义的斗争，并引导人民在建设、工业化和进步的道路上前进。
    我们在这里所遇到的亲切和信任的气氛使我们相信，我们有理由认为一切都使我们连结在一起，一切都使我们更加接近。我们的过去和现在，我们的苦难和反帝斗争，我们对自由和和平的共同爱好，这一切都足以加强我们的友谊。我们还要说，在今天这个世界上，我们的利益是共同的。
    我们对我们的斗争的胜利抱有绝对的信心。阿尔及利亚人民首先依靠他们自己，依靠他们实现解放的不可动摇的意志，依靠他们的爱国主义，依靠他们不惜牺牲以战胜殖民主义的精神。
    阿尔及利亚人民还依靠一切反对殖民主义的人民的支持，主要是亚非人民的支持。
    由于我们相信人的宝贵作用，我们在六亿中国人的支持下一定会取得胜利。由于我们相信人的宝贵作用，我们在三分之二的人类的支持下一定会取得胜利。
    因为这个缘故，我们不怕法国从它的盟国，特别是美国方面所取得的物质力量和巨大的支持。
    法国在阿尔及利亚进行着灭绝人类的战争，法国军队不惜进行集体屠杀、放火、奸淫和掳掠。妇女、儿童和老人都毫无区别地遭到了屠杀。
    但是阿尔及利亚人民必将取得胜利，因为他们的事业是正义的，因为他们站在进步力量的一边，而殖民主义却正在削弱并且注定要死亡。殖民主义处在垂死的痛苦之中。阿尔及利亚人民正在给予最后的一击。
    法国殖民主义的最后挣扎威胁着世界和平，它在1956年侵略苏伊士，它不断侵略突尼斯、摩洛哥和利比亚，它在公海上检查许多国家的船只，这些都表现出这一点。
    阿尔及利亚战争是一场争取自由反对压迫的战争。阿尔及利亚人民的胜利将是自由的胜利。一切爱好和平、自由和进步的人民都向全世界宣布他们同阿尔及利亚人民团结在一起。因此阿尔及利亚人民的胜利也将是他们的胜利。
    这些人民在帝国主义力量面前应当表明，他们的团结不是一句空话，不能不给予考虑。各国人民的自由和独立，应当迫使帝国主义接受。
    至于阿尔及利亚人民，他们是愿意通过谈判来结束战争的。但是只要他们的权利一天没有得到承认，他们就决心为争取自由和民族独立而斗争到底。
    我们感谢中国亚非团结委员会使我们有这个机会向中国人民讲话。
    伟大的中华人民共和国的英勇的人民万岁！
    为争取独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
