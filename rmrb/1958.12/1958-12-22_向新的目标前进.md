Advancing Towards New Goals

Today, we report to the people of the whole country with incomparable excitement a piece of good news: the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year has been fulfilled ahead of schedule! The Chinese people, who keep their word, have written a magnificent page in the history of world steel industry with vigorous strokes: steel production doubles in one year!

10.7 million tons, this is an extraordinary number that has deeply rooted itself in the lives of our people in recent months. It is a beautiful painting, a moving poem, and a brilliant milestone in the great leap forward of our socialist construction. In recent months, for the doubling of steel production, battlefields have been set up everywhere, whether in steel capitals or in the Central Plains, whether at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains or on the East Coast; for the doubling of steel production, millions of people have embarked on long expeditions with light packs on the mining fields, millions of people have been traveling day and night on the transportation lines, and millions of people have been toiling hard by the steelmaking furnaces. Today, 10.7 million tons of steel have finally been obtained. At this moment of celebrating the doubling of steel production, we extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to the heroic warriors who fought for the doubling of steel production and to the comrades who supported the doubling of steel production in their own posts: Comrades, you have worked hard!

In just one year, China's steel output has increased from more than five million tons to more than ten million tons, which is an unprecedented speed. In the more than fifty years before liberation, the country's steel production, excluding the Northeast, was only tens of thousands of tons; including the Northeast, the highest annual output was only more than nine hundred thousand tons. In 1949, the year the People's Republic of China was founded, due to the destruction of the war, the country's steel output was only more than one hundred thousand tons. During the three years of recovery and the five years of construction, China's steel output increased rapidly, with an average annual increase of about 650,000 tons, but this year alone it increased by more than five million tons, which cannot but be a groundbreaking miracle in China's history. Opening the history of industrial development of capitalist countries, the United States took seven years to increase steel production from more than five million tons to more than ten million tons, Germany took eight years, Japan took twenty years, France took twenty-nine years, and the United Kingdom took thirty-two years; while China only took one year. This was once considered unimaginable. People remember that after the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee issued a call for doubling steel production at the Beidaihe meeting in early September, the imperialist bigwigs ridiculed wantonly, saying they wanted to see "how much of this is fact and how much is dream." However, the ruthless facts finally proved that it was not us who were dreaming, but those who laughed at us. Facts most vividly show that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system, and in the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism, socialism will surely surpass capitalism. For the imperialist bigwigs, admitting this is certainly very unpleasant, so they always deny the advantages of socialism and the disadvantages of capitalism; but the facts are always the facts, and what is the use of denying them?

Our social system has such great power because our people have been freed from the enslavement of class society, and further freed from the shackles of private ownership, and have truly become the masters of society and nature; they are no longer blindly enslaved by objective laws, but are able to understand, grasp, and use objective laws to transform the world. The struggle to realize the doubling of steel production is a great practice of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to understand, grasp, and use objective laws to transform the world. This great practice proves that once people change from being enslaved by objective laws to consciously using objective laws, they can exert tremendous subjective initiative in transforming the world and create miracles that capitalist societies cannot dream of. The great victory of completing the doubling of steel production is the victory of the Party's policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward, the policy of simultaneously promoting central and local industries, the policy of simultaneously promoting large and medium-sized and small enterprises, the policy of simultaneously promoting indigenous and foreign methods of production, and the policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements, which were proposed by our Party in this great practice. This reflects that we have begun to grasp and apply the objective laws of China's industrial development. Implementing these policies, grasping and applying these objective laws, not only enabled us to achieve the victory of doubling steel production this year, the victory of increasing machine tool production from 28,000 units last year to more than 90,000 units, and the victory of increasing coal production from 130 million tons last year to 270 million tons, but will also certainly enable us to achieve even greater victories in developing industry in the future.

Of course, it should also be pointed out that our understanding, mastery, and application of the objective laws of socialist economic construction in China is only the beginning at present, and we must further earnestly study, correctly grasp, and skillfully apply these objective laws. This year we have implemented the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward, and have achieved great victories, which is undoubtedly affirmed; however, we must also see that due to the short time, the tight task, and the lack of experience, some shortcomings have also been produced, causing excessive tension in some aspects and some imbalances. This is difficult to completely avoid in the process of the great leap forward. These shortcomings, compared with our great achievements, are only a little finger or less than a little finger among the ten fingers. The tide-watching faction and the account-settling faction attempt to use this to negate the fruitful labor results of our people, which will never succeed. However, we should draw lessons from these shortcomings while summarizing the successful experience, and further study and master the economic laws concerning the planned and proportionate development of socialist economic construction, so that our construction plans fully conform to or are close to fully conforming to these economic laws.

The great victory we have achieved is enough to be proud of, but there is no reason to be complacent. Because the achievements we have reached are still far from our ambitious goals. Our country has not yet fundamentally rid itself of the "poor and blank" situation, and the construction tasks facing us are still very arduous. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has proposed a planned target of producing 18 million tons of steel next year. According to this target, the increase in steel production next year will be 7 million tons, which is more than the estimated increase of more than 5 million tons this year. This is an even greater leap forward goal. The soldiers on the steel front must guard against arrogance and rashness, continue to work hard, and advance towards new combat goals.

In the new struggle to produce 18 million tons of steel, the iron must be good iron, the steel must be good steel, and the steel must be finished products, and the materials must be of various types. Without good iron, it is difficult to have good steel; without good steel, it is difficult to roll steel materials, and it is even more difficult to roll various types of steel materials; without various types of steel materials, it is impossible to meet the various needs of production and construction. Therefore, steel production must continue to improve on the existing basis, on the one hand, to ensure quantity, and on the other hand, to pass the quality control of steel and the rolling control. In order to pass the quality control of steel, it is necessary to seriously solve the technical problems of steel production, especially the technical problem of using native iron in foreign furnaces, and apply native iron and native steel to a wider range of fields. In order to pass the rolling control, it is necessary to immediately launch a campaign to increase steel production, vigorously carry out technical revolution, give full play to the potential of existing rolling equipment, and complete the manufacturing of rolling equipment as soon as possible, especially to pay attention to eliminating the phenomenon of mismatching in the manufacturing and supply of these equipment, so as to put them into production as soon as possible, so that rolling production will have a great increase in the first quarter of next year. To complete the greater production task next year, the key lies in walking on two legs, implementing the whole set of policies of walking on two legs proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and continuing to vigorously carry out mass movements. At present, there are two aspects to the mass movement on the steel front, namely, the mass movement of small-scale, indigenous steel production (also called "small indigenous groups") and the mass movement of large-scale, modern steel production (also called "large foreign groups"). In the aspect of "small indigenous groups," we should continue to rely on the masses, grasp the work of rectification, consolidation, and improvement, and strive to rectify the first batch of steel bases in the first quarter of next year; where conditions permit, we should develop towards small-scale iron and steel joint ventures combining indigenous and foreign methods as much as possible. In the aspect of "large foreign groups," we should actively promote successful experiences such as "two participations (cadres participate in production, workers participate in management), one reform (reform unreasonable rules and regulations), and three combinations (leading cadres, workers, and technicians are combined under the unified leadership of the Party committee)," so that key enterprises can exert greater power.

The great 1958 is coming to an end. In these unforgettable days, we have personally recorded the miracle of doubling steel production in history and victoriously ended a great battle. Looking around inside and outside the Great Wall, north and south of the Yangtze River, how many suns and moons, how much has the landscape added to its color! Countless steel furnaces are spread all over towns and villages, and thousands of heroic sons and daughters are fighting hard in the high mountains and fertile fields. This magnificent picture of national steelmaking fills us with confidence in the prospects of socialist construction. Let us continue to work hard, practically, and ingeniously, and strive to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959!

    向新的目标前进
    今天，我们怀着无比兴奋的心情，向全国人民报告一个好消息：党中央和毛主席关于今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的伟大号召已经提前实现了！说到、做到的中国人民用龙飞凤舞的笔触，在世界钢铁工业史上写下了气势磅礴的一页：一年之间，钢产加番！
    一○七○，这是近几个月来我国人民生活中一个深入人心的不平常的数字。它是一幅美丽的画、一首动人的诗，是我国社会主义建设事业大跃进中的一座光辉的里程碑。几个月来，为了钢产加番，不论是在钢都是在中原，不论是在天山脚下是在东海岸边，到处摆开了战场；为了钢产加番千万人轻装远征在采矿场上，千万人昼夜兼程在运输线上，千万人挥汗苦战在炼钢炉旁。今天，一千零七十万吨钢终于拿到手了。在这祝贺钢产加番的时刻，我们向全国为钢产加番而战的英雄战士们和在自己的岗位上支援钢产加番的同志们，致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问：同志们，你们辛苦了！
    仅仅一年的时间，我国钢的产量就从五百多万吨增加到一千多万吨，这是史无前例的速度。我国在解放前的五十多年间，全国除东北外钢产一直只有几万吨；加上东北，全国最高的年产量也不过是九十多万吨。在中华人民共和国成立的那一年，1949年，由于战争的破坏，全国的钢产量只有十几万吨。在三年恢复和五年建设期间，我国的钢产量增长是很快的，平均每年增加六十五万吨左右，但今年一年就增加了五百多万吨，这不能不是我国历史上破天荒的奇迹。翻开资本主义国家工业发展史，钢产量由五百多万吨增加到一千多万吨，美国用了七年的时间，德国用了八年的时间，日本用了二十年的时间，法国用了二十九年的时间，英国用了三十二年的时间；而我国只用了一年的时间。这曾经被认为是不可想像的。人们记得，九月初，党的中央政治局北戴河会议发出关于钢产加番的号召以后，帝国主义的大人先生们肆意嘲弄，说什么要看看这“多大程度是事实，多大程度是梦想”。然而，无情的事实终于证明了，做梦的不是我们，而恰是那些嘲笑我们的人。事实最生动地说明：社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越得多，在社会主义和资本主义的和平竞赛中，社会主义必将胜过资本主义。对于帝国主义的大人先生们说来，承认这一点当然是很不愉快的，因而他们总是否认社会主义的优势和资本主义的劣势；可是，事实总归是事实，否认又有什么用处呢？
    我们的社会制度所以具有强大的力量，是因为我们的人民已经摆脱了阶级社会的奴役，并进而摆脱了私有制的束缚，真正成为社会和自然的主人；他们不再盲目地受客观规律的奴役，而能够认识、掌握和运用客观规律来改造世界。为实现钢产加番的斗争，就是中国人民在中国共产党领导下，认识、掌握和运用客观规律来改造世界的一次伟大的实践。这个伟大的实践，证明了人们一旦由受客观规律奴役转变到自觉地运用客观规律，就能够在改造世界中发挥巨大的能动作用，创造出资本主义社会所梦想不到的奇迹。完成钢产加番的伟大胜利，是我们的党在这个伟大的实践中提出的以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，土法生产和洋法生产同时并举的方针，集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合的方针的胜利。这反映了我们已经开始掌握和运用我国工业发展的客观规律。贯彻这些方针，掌握和运用这些客观规律，不仅使我们在今年取得了钢产加番的胜利，取得了机床产量由去年的二万八千台增加到九万多台的胜利，取得了煤炭产量由去年的一亿三千万吨增加到二亿七千万吨的胜利，而且也一定能使我们今后在发展工业上取得更大的胜利。
    当然，也应当指出，我们对于我国社会主义经济建设的客观规律的认识、掌握和运用，目前仅仅是开始，还必须进一步认真地研究、正确地掌握、熟练地运用这些客观规律。今年我们贯彻实行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，取得了伟大的胜利，这是肯定无疑的；但是，我们也必须看到，由于时间很短，任务很紧，经验又不足，因而也产生了一些缺点，在某些方面造成了过分的紧张，产生了一些失调的现象。这是大跃进的过程中难于完全避免的。这些缺点同我们获得的伟大成就相比，只是十个指头中的一个小指头或者不到一个小指头。观潮派和算账派企图借此来否定我国人民的丰硕的劳动成果是绝对不会成功的。但是我们应当在总结成功的经验的同时，从这些缺点中吸取教训，进一步研究和掌握关于社会主义经济建设有计划、按比例发展的经济法则，使我们的建设计划完全符合或者接近于完全符合这一经济法则。
    我们所取得的伟大胜利足以自豪，但是没有理由自满。因为我们已达到的成就同我们远大的目标比较起来，还有很大的距离。我们的国家至今还没有根本摆脱“一穷二白”的局面，摆在我们面前的建设任务仍然十分艰巨。党的八届六中全会已经提出了明年生产一千八百万吨钢的计划指标。根据这个指标，明年的钢的增产量为七百万吨，比今年的预计增产量五百多万吨还要多。这是一个更加伟大的跃进目标。钢铁战线上的战士们一定要戒骄戒躁，继续努力，向新的斗争目标前进。
    在生产一千八百万吨钢的新的斗争中，必须铁是好铁、钢是好钢，而且钢要成材、材要多种。没有好铁，难有好钢；没有好钢，难轧钢材，更难轧多种多样的钢材；没有多种多样的钢材，就不能满足生产和建设的多种多样的需要。因此，钢铁生产必须在现有的基础上继续提高，一方面保证数量，一方面过好钢铁的质量关和轧钢关。为了过好钢铁的质量关，要认真解决钢铁生产的技术问题，特别是洋炉子吃土铁的技术问题，将土铁土钢应用到更广泛的方面去。为了过好轧钢关，要立即开展一个增产钢材的运动，大搞技术革命，充分发挥现有轧钢设备的潜力，尽快完成轧钢设备的制造，特别要注意消除这些设备的制造和供应中互不配套的现象，以便尽早投入生产，使轧钢生产在明年第一季度就有很大的增长。完成明年更伟大的生产任务，关键还在于用两条腿走路，贯彻党的八届六中全会提出的用两条腿走路的一整套方针，继续大搞群众运动。目前，钢铁战线的群众运动有两个方面，即小型的、土法的钢铁生产的群众运动（也叫“小土群”）和大型的现代化的钢铁生产的群众运动（也叫“大洋群”）这两个方面。“小土群”方面应该继续依靠群众，抓紧整顿、巩固和提高的工作，争取在明年第一季度内整顿好第一批钢铁基点；在有条件的地方，应该尽可能地向土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业方面发展。“大洋群”方面应该积极推行“两参（干部参加生产、工人参加管理）、一改（改革不合理的规章制度）、三结合（在党委统一领导下，领导干部、工人和技术人员相结合）”等成功的经验，使重点企业发挥更大的威力。
    伟大的1958年快要过去了。在这难忘的日子里，我们亲手把钢产加番的奇迹载入史册，胜利地结束了一个伟大的战役。环顾长城内外，大江南北，日月几何，江山姿色添多少！数不尽的钢铁炉群遍布城镇乡村，千万英雄儿女奋战高山沃野。这一幅宏伟的全民炼钢图，使我们对社会主义建设事业的前景充满了信心。让我们继续实干苦干巧干，为实现1959年更伟大的跃进而奋斗！
