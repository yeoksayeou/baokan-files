Maoming City - An Oil City Under Construction

Maoming Oil City began large-scale construction in May this year and has now entered a stage of intense construction.

The main plant of the oil city, the center of the entire infrastructure project, is a shale oil plant with 288 retorts, which officially began construction in October this year. The Thirteenth Construction Brigade of the Central Construction Engineering Machinery Construction Corporation, which is undertaking the earthwork construction task of this plant, is launching a labor competition for excavation and land leveling with the revolutionary spirit of constantly creating new records. They plan to complete 700,000 cubic meters of earthwork this year, a six-fold increase over the original plan.

Surrounding the shale oil plant, fourteen subsidiary enterprises will be established in this oil city to form a comprehensive base, making full use of all waste materials from shale oil production to produce by-products such as cement, aluminum, fertilizer, and nylon.

Now, in the already operational experimental field, in addition to its original circular retort, a recently built square retort will soon be put into production. They have also implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, establishing seven indigenous retorting piles in the experimental field, using piled retorting methods to extract shale oil, which is then processed into crude oil.

On December 1st, the Lianjiang-Maoming Railway was opened to traffic, and many materials can be transported by rail from various places to support this oil city, which is undergoing large-scale construction. (Attached pictures)

    茂名市——建设中的石油城
    茂名石油城从今年5月起开始大规模建设，现在已经进入紧张的施工阶段。
    石油城的主要厂房——整个基建工程的中心，是一座拥有二百八十八个干馏炉的页岩油厂，今年10月间正式施工。承担这座厂房土方施工任务的中央建筑工程机械施工总公司第十三施工大队，正以不断创造新纪录的革命精神，展开挖土和平土的劳动竞赛。他们计划今年完成七十万立方公尺土方，比原定计划提高六倍。
    围绕着这页岩油厂，在这座石油城里将要建立十四个附属企业，构成一个综合性基地，充分利用页岩油生产中的一切废料，以生产水泥、铝、肥田粉和尼龙等副产品。
    现在，已经投入生产的试验场，除了它原有的一座圆形干馏炉外，最近建成的一座方形干馏炉，不久就要投入生产了。他们还实行了土洋并举的方针，在试验场建立了七个土法干馏堆，用成堆的干馏法来提取页岩油，再加工成原油。
    12月1日廉茂铁路通车了，许多物资都可以由铁路从各地运来支援这个正在大规模建设的石油城。（附图片）
