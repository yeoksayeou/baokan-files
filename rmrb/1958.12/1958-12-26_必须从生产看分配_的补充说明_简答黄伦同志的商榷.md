Supplementary Explanation of "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production"
—A Brief Reply to Comrade Huang Lun's Discussion
Fang Ming

After reading Comrade Huang Lun's "Do Not Mechanically Understand the Law of Production Determining Distribution" on December 12th, I felt that Comrade Huang Lun's enthusiasm and desire to explore the truth were good, and his attitude in discussing the issue was relatively calm; however, regarding the issue itself, I feel there is a need for further explanation.

First, Comrade Huang Lun's statement that the article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" "one-sidedly understands economic laws and neglects people's ability to understand, control, and use economic laws" is groundless.

1. The article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" only explores the relationship between distribution and production, and does not explore the relationship between "economic laws and people." These are two separate issues. Although the relationship between distribution and production is a matter of economic laws, it does not follow that because it is a matter of economic laws, and any objective law is always dialectically related to human subjective initiative, that anyone should be required to never explore the dialectical relationship between distribution and production in isolation under any circumstances. Marxist classic writers have specifically elaborated on the dialectical relationship between production and distribution in many places, and in other places, they have specifically elaborated on the dialectical relationship between objective laws and subjective initiative. Therefore, one cannot use an issue I have not touched upon to refute me; that would likely be Zhang San refuting Zhang San, and have nothing to do with Li Si.

2. The article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" did not, as Comrade Huang Lun said, "mechanically, one-sidedly, and mythically understand the law of production determining distribution" regarding the dialectical relationship between production and distribution. Please carefully understand the other party's article and make a judgment based on facts. For example, the article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" stated: "The mode of distribution is not only passively determined by the mode of production and mode of exchange, but also actively influences production and exchange in return." Comrade Huang Lun criticized:
	I believe that Comrade Fang Ming has made a mechanical, one-sided, and mythical understanding of the law of production determining distribution. This is partly because he did not see the dialectical relationship between production and distribution: "Distribution is not a purely passive result of production and exchange; distribution in turn affects production and exchange" ("Anti-Dühring").
I really feel very surprised! Why is it that when I retell Engels's views, it is considered a "mechanical, one-sided, and mythical understanding," while Comrade Huang Lun copying this passage is not? Furthermore, my article seems to have spoken more fully about production promoting distribution and the Party's leadership and putting politics in command than Comrade Huang Lun has!

3. When Comrade Huang Lun talks about "people's ability to understand, control, and use economic laws," he opposes people's "subjective initiative" to objective laws, which is incorrect. Only people's subjective wishes are opposed to objective laws. The concept of subjective initiative itself means fully utilizing objective laws. The article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" exploring the objective laws of production and distribution is precisely a concrete action manifestation of subjective initiative, not a literal language manifestation. Therefore, it is not fair to blame someone for not talking about "subjective initiative" (and possibly subjective wishes) in their language, and blaming them for not opposing subjective initiative to objective laws, when they are already taking concrete action to utilize subjective initiative to explore objective laws. Furthermore, it must be noted that many people cannot understand the principled distinction between subjective wishes and subjective initiative; they talk about subjective initiative in words, but in fact, they act according to subjective wishes, and they often theoretically oppose the so-called "subjective initiative" to objective laws. Furthermore, many people do not recognize and grasp the level of awareness of the masses as an objectively existing thing with discoverable laws, but instead replace the detailed work of leading the masses with a vague "giving play to subjective initiative."

Second, Comrade Huang Lun's statement that "the supply system of military communism has a close internal connection with social production in the liberated areas" is somewhat akin to sophistry. I feel it is unnecessary to repeat the arguments in the article "View Distribution from Production" any further.

I will only point out two points: 1. Marxism says that the social mode of production determines the social mode of distribution, and the social mode of distribution in turn actively influences the social mode of production. The supply system of military communism in the liberated areas was not the social mode of distribution, but only a distribution system within the revolutionary camp. The so-called social mode of production is the unity of social productive forces and social relations of production. Comrade Huang Lun's use of the concept of "social production in the liberated areas" to confuse and surreptitiously replace the concept of the social mode of production in the liberated areas, that is, the concept of the New Democratic mode of production, is inappropriate.

2. Comrade Huang Lun uses the fact that "the supply system of military communism relies on fiscal revenue, and fiscal revenue depends on the economy" to argue that the social mode of production in the liberated areas determined the supply system of military communism, saying that this is production determining distribution, that this is the internal connection between production and distribution, which is very frivolous. The so-called mode of production determining the mode of distribution means that the social mode of production in the liberated areas was of a New Democratic nature, and therefore its social mode of distribution was also of a New Democratic nature. The original article's so-called "specific internal connection" refers to this. However, Comrade Huang Lun's so-called "close internal connection" has nothing to do with this. As for saying that it was the supply system of military communism rather than the New Democratic social revolution and production construction that promoted some development of the productive forces in the old liberated areas, this is contrary to facts and common sense.

Third, Comrade Huang Lun believes that the article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" advocates that "surplus value exists in socialist society," which is another case of Zhang San refuting Zhang San, and has nothing to do with Li Si.

1. The explanation of distribution according to labor in the article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" is based on Marx's argument on this issue. If I have not spoken precisely or have made a mistake, I am responsible. I will no longer copy the passages copied by Comrade Huang Lun, I will only copy Marx's argument as follows:

	"What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges.

	Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. … He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.

	Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is the exchange of equal value. … But, as far as the distribution of the means of consumption among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.

	Hence, equal right here is still in principle – bourgeois right, …" ("Critique of the Gotha Programme").

2. According to Marx's argument, Comrade Huang Lun said, "In short, under the socialist system, labor power is still a commodity… The nature of labor in socialist society is no different from the nature of labor in capitalist society. If we extend this logically (?), surplus value exists in socialist society. This reaches an absurd point." Comrade Huang Lun is free to "extend" it however he wishes, that is just Comrade Huang Lun self-criticizing.

3. If I had directly used "receiving back labor shares" instead of "expending labor to exchange for wages as remuneration" according to Marx, if I had directly used "exchange of equal value" instead of the "law of value," if I had not written the inaccurate statement "exchanging individual labor as a commodity with society," then it is very likely that I would not have caused Comrade Huang Lun's serious misunderstanding. Even if it is said that my expression deviates from Marx's original meaning, Comrade Huang Lun's "extensions" are groundless.

4. When I was writing the article, it was at a time when many people were saying that "distribution according to labor" was capitalist exploitation, inequality, or even a feudal hierarchy. The spirit of my entire article was to oppose this viewpoint. However, at the time, I felt that if I did not state the defects of distribution according to labor as truthfully and fully as possible, I would definitely be considered a "defender of bourgeois rights." I did not apply the principles of Marxism on distribution according to labor precisely enough, but there is absolutely none of what Comrade Huang Lun has extrapolated.

In my opinion, only the third of Comrade Huang Lun's three points of rebuttal has some merit. The first and second points are completely rebuttals for the sake of rebuttal, and Comrade Huang Lun is criticizing Comrade Huang Lun. The third point is basically still Comrade Huang Lun criticizing Comrade Huang Lun's "extensions," but I believe that one must correctly understand others' erroneous criticisms. Therefore, I express my sincere gratitude for the third point.

    “必须从生产看分配”的补充说明 
    ——简答黄伦同志的商榷
    方名
    读过12月12日黄伦同志“不要机械地理解生产决定分配的规律”，感觉黄伦同志探讨真理的热情和愿望是好的，同时探讨问题的态度，也比较冷静；只是，关于问题的本身，我觉得还有加以说明的必要。
    第一、黄伦同志说“必须从生产看分配”一文“片面地理解经济规律，忽视了人对经济规律的认识、控制和运用的能力”。这是毫无根据的。
    1、“必须从生产看分配”一文只是探讨分配与生产的联系，而没有探讨“经济规律和人”的联系。这是两个问题。尽管分配与生产的联系是经济规律问题，但并不能因为它是经济规律问题，而任何客观规律和人的主观能动性又总是存在着辩证的联系，于是就要求任何人在任何情况下都不能单独探讨分配与生产的辩证联系。马克思主义经典作家在许多地方专门阐述过生产与分配的辩证联系，而在另一些地方又专门阐述过客观规律和主观能动性的辩证联系。因此，不能用我没有涉及到的问题来反驳，那样很可能是张三反驳张三，和李四无干。
    2、“必须从生产看分配”一文对生产分配的辩证联系，并没有如黄伦同志所说“对生产决定分配的规律作了机械的、片面的、神化的理解”。请仔细理解对方文章，并实事求是地作出判断。例如：“必须从生产看分配”文中写道：“分配方式不只是消极地被生产方式和交换方式所决定，同时也反过来积极地影响生产和交换。”黄伦同志批评道：
      我认为方名同志把生产决定分配的规律作了机械的、片面的、
  神化的理解。这一方面是因为没有看到生产与分配之间的辩证关
  系：“分配并不是生产和交换的单纯消极的结果；分配反过来又
  影响生产和交换”（反杜林论）。我实在觉得非常诧异！为什么我转述恩格斯的观点就是“作了机械的、片面的、神化的理解”，而黄伦同志照抄这一段文献就不是？再说，我的文章对于生产促进分配，对于党的领导和政治挂帅似乎比黄伦同志说得还要充分得多呢！
    3、黄伦同志在谈“人对经济规律的认识、控制和运用的能力”的时候，把人们的“主观能动性”和客观规律相对立，这是不对的。只有人们的主观愿望才和客观规律相对立。而主观能动性这一概念本身就意味着充分运用客观规律。“必须从生产看分配”一文探讨生产和分配的客观规律正是主观能动性的具体行动表现，而不是字面语言表现。因此，别人已经在行动中运用主观能动性探讨客观规律，你却责备他不在语言中大讲“主观能动性”（乃至可能是主观愿望），责备他不把主观能动性和客观规律相对立，这也不是公允的。还有，必须注意：不少人不能理解主观愿望和主观能动性的原则区别，嘴上讲的主观能动性，事实上是在照主观愿望办事，而他们经常在理论上就是用所谓的“主观能动性”和客观规律相对立。还有不少人对于人民群众的觉悟水平不是当作一种客观存在的有规律可寻的东西来认识和掌握领导，而是用笼统的“发挥主观能动性”代替了领导群众的细致工作。
    第二、黄伦同志说“军事共产主义供给制，与解放区社会生产有密切的内部联系”，这有点类于强词夺理。我觉得似乎不必要再重复“从生产看分配”文中的论点。
    我只指出两点：1、马克思主义讲的是社会生产方式决定社会分配方式，而社会分配方式又反过来积极影响社会生产方式。军事共产主义的供给制在解放区不是社会分配方式，只是在革命阵营内部的分配制度。所谓社会生产方式是社会生产力和社会生产关系的统一。黄伦同志用“解放区社会生产”这一概念混淆和偷换了解放区社会生产方式，即是新民主主义生产方式这一概念，是不妥当的。
    2、黄伦同志用“军事共产主义的供给制有赖于财政收入，而财政又依赖于经济”来论证解放区的社会生产方式决定军事共产主义的供给制，说这是生产决定分配，这是生产和分配的内部联系，这是很不严肃的。所谓生产方式决定分配方式是说的解放区的社会生产方式是新民主主义性质的，因而它的社会分配方式也是新民主主义性质的。原文所谓“特定内部联系”是指此。而黄伦同志所谓“密切的内部联系”则和这毫不相干。至于说是军事共产主义的供给制而不是新民主主义的社会革命和生产建设促进老解放区生产力的某些发展，这是违背事实和常识的。
    第三、黄伦同志认为“必须从生产看分配”一文主张“社会主义社会存在剩余价值”，这又是张三反驳张三，与李四无干。
    1、“必须从生产看分配”一文中解释按劳分配，是根据马克思关于这一问题的论点，我如说得不精确，出了错误，由我负责。黄伦同志抄引的我不再抄，我只将马克思的论点照抄如下：
        “我们这里所说的不是已经在自身基础上发展了的共产主义
  社会，而是刚刚从资本主义社会中产生出来，因此，在各方面，即
  在经济、道德和智慧方面都还保留其所由脱胎出来的那个旧社会痕
  迹的共产主义社会。
      所以，每一个别的生产者，在作了各项扣除之后，从社会中
  正好领回他所给予社会的一切。他所给予社会的，就是他个人的
  劳动股份。……他从社会方面领得一张收据，证明他供给了多少
  劳动（扣除他为社会基金而进行的劳动），而他凭这张收据又从
  社会储备中领得与其劳动量相等的那么多的消费品。他以一种形
  态给予社会的劳动量，又以另一种形态全部取回来。
      显然，这里通行的就是那个调节商品交换的原则，因为商品
  交换是同等价值的交换。……但是，说到消费品在各个生产者中
  间的分配，那末这里通行着在商品等价物的交换里也通行的那个
  原则，即一种形态的一定数量的劳动可以与另一种形态的同量劳
  动交换。
      所以，这里平等的权利在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权，
  ……”（“论共产主义社会”）。
    2、根据马克思的论点，黄伦同志说，“简言之，在社会主义制度下，劳动力仍然是商品……社会主义社会的劳动同资本主义社会的劳动在性质上毫无区别了。如此合理（？）引伸下去，社会主义社会就存在剩余价值了。这就到了荒谬的地步”。黄伦同志愿意怎样“引伸”都有自由，那只是黄伦同志在自我批判而已。
    3、我如果直接按照马克思用“领回劳动股份”代替“支出劳动换取工资作为酬劳”，我如果直接用
  “同等价值的交换”代替“价值法则”，如果不写“把个人劳动作为商品向社会进行交换”这种不确切的语句，那么，很可能不会引起黄伦同志的严重误解。即令说我的表述有失马克思的原意，黄伦同志的“引伸”都是毫无根据的。
    4、我写文章的时候，正是许多人把“按劳分配”说成是资本主义剥削的不平等甚至是封建等级制的时候，我的全文的精神是反对这种观点的。但我当时觉得如果不把按劳分配的缺陷说得如实的充分，那一定会被认为是“资产阶级法权的辩护者”。我对马克思主义论按劳分配的道理应用得不够精确，但绝无黄伦同志所引伸的一切。
    照我看来，黄伦同志的三点反驳意见，只有第三点还有若干可取之处。第一、二点完全是为反驳而反驳，是黄伦同志在批判黄伦同志。第三点基本上仍是黄伦同志批判黄伦同志的“引伸”，但我认为别人错误的批评，自己要正确的理解。因此，对第三点，我表示诚恳的感谢。
