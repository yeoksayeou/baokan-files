Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 18th: Iraqi Republic Radio published a commentary on the 17th, stating that the Iraqi Republic, relying on its own unity and the unity of the Arab people, is fully capable of resisting aggressors and crushing the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism. Their conspiracies, distortions, and deceptions can only make Iraq more determined to follow the path of free Arab nationalism.

The radio station said that the Iraqi Republic will continue to be a bastion of Arab nationalism against imperialism and its agents. We will receive the support of all Arab people and all freedom-loving people who are determined to crush imperialism and reactionaries in the world.

The radio station pointed out that the trend of the Arab national movement is to completely get rid of imperialist control and imperialist vassalage. It adopts a policy of cooperation with all countries without exception on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit, and makes every effort to combat imperialism and its agents, traitors, and corrupt groups colluding with imperialism.

The radio station said that it is not surprising that free Arab nationalism is currently threatened by conspiracies. Because the victory of the Arab national movement is of great significance to the struggle to eliminate the imperialist system and end imperialist control. The birth of the Iraqi Republic is an important turning point in the development of free Arab nationalism. The Iraqi revolution destroyed a powerful regime controlled by imperialism. It has recently been working to eradicate the imperialist roots that have long been deeply rooted in all aspects of life.

The radio station recalled that free Arab nationalism once faced naked imperialist aggression from Israel, as well as threats and constant pressure from imperialism, including aggression in the form of economic blockades. However, due to the unity of the Arab people, these aggressions did not succeed. The radio station then pointed out that imperialism discovered that the Iraqi Republic was an uncontrollable force, and it was competing with imperialism to defend free Arab nationalism. Therefore, imperialism adopted the old and foolish method of conspiracy, distorting the truth of free Arab nationalism, coating its conspiracy with nationalism, using distorted national slogans as a guise for deception, and trying to undermine the unity of the Iraqi people of all ethnic groups and patriotic forces, as well as the unity of Iraq with all Arab people. Under this hidden offensive, imperialism carried out a conspiracy that threatened the survival of the Iraqi Republic.

The radio station emphasized that the great Iraqi people and their heroic army, under the leadership of Prime Minister Qassem, continue to advance victoriously, resolutely taking the revolutionary road of liberation, democracy, and freedom.

The radio station pointed out that the Iraqi Republic has adopted a policy of crushing reactionary regimes supported by imperialism and implementing land reform, and has taken the road of solving all problems based on the will of the people. Qassem once emphasized that the form and policy of the regime can only be decided by the people. No force can impose its will on the Iraqi people. Any attempt to make Iraq abandon this path will be exposed by the people. The ultimate victory will surely belong to the great Iraqi people.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 19th: According to the Hungarian News Agency: An Iraqi government spokesman told Danish, a reporter from the Hungarian News Agency stationed in Arab countries, on the 8th, regarding the recent conspiracy case uncovered by the Iraqi government, that the conspirators aimed to overthrow the republic's regime and deprive the Iraqi people of their victorious achievements. The spokesman said that thanks to the vigilance of the Iraqi people and the wisdom of Prime Minister Qassem, the conspiracy of the republic's enemies was finally crushed.

When talking about the new military agreement that the United States and Iran are preparing to conclude, the spokesman said that our policy is based on peaceful coexistence and neutrality, so we condemn the United States for signing military agreements with other countries. He also said that, in fact, these military agreements can only threaten the interests of some small countries and turn them into satellite states of imperialist powers.

When talking about the Iraqi government's attitude towards the Baghdad Pact, the spokesman pointed out that the Iraqi government has not yet formally expressed its attitude towards the Baghdad Pact concluded by the former regime. However, we can now be sure that neutrality and faithful implementation of the United Nations Charter are sufficient to guarantee peace in the Middle East.

When talking about the United Nations re-listing the "Hungarian issue" on the agenda, the spokesman clearly pointed out that the Iraqi people have rich experience in the methods of imperialists. The methods adopted by imperialists on the Hungarian issue are a typical example. We firmly believe that the democratic system of the Hungarian people represents the true will of the Hungarian people.

Regarding the Iraqi people's protest against the "visit" of US Assistant Secretary of State Rountree, the spokesman explained: We advocate democracy and freedom of speech. Therefore, our people and our newspapers expressed their true attitude during the visit of the US Assistant Secretary of State. However, we advocate discussing some issues, so we expressed our willingness to receive Rountree in Baghdad.

In answering another question, the spokesman reiterated the Iraqi government's willingness to be friendly with all countries. He said that the economic and cultural agreements that have been signed and will be signed with socialist countries reflect the positive steps taken in this regard.

The spokesman finally said that the Iraqi government is preparing to adopt short-term plans to solve some social and economic problems, and is also preparing long-term plans for national industrialization. He said, we firmly believe that all major decisions depend on the people. Our primary goal is to consolidate the republic and strengthen the unity of the Iraqi people.

    伊拉克共和国电台发表评论指出
    伊拉克有力量粉碎帝国主义阴谋
    政府发言人谴责美国和伊朗缔结军事协定
    新华社巴格达18日电  伊拉克共和国电台17日发表评论说，伊拉克共和国依靠本国的团结一致和阿拉伯人民的团结一致，完全有力量反击侵略者，粉碎帝国主义的阴谋诡计，它们的阴谋、歪曲和迷惑只能使伊拉克更加坚持走自由阿拉伯民族主义的道路。
    电台说，伊拉克共和国将继续是反对帝国主义及其代理人的阿拉伯民族主义的堡垒。我们将得到全体阿拉伯人民和一切爱好自由、决心粉碎世界上的帝国主义和反动派的人民的支持。
    电台指出，阿拉伯民族运动的趋向是，彻底摆脱帝国主义控制和帝国主义的附庸地位。它采取在互相尊重主权、领土完整、不干涉内政和互利的基础上，没有例外地同一切国家合作的政策，并全力打击帝国主义及其代理人、卖国贼和勾结帝国主义的腐化集团。
    电台说，自由阿拉伯民族主义在目前遭到阴谋威胁是不足为奇的。因为阿拉伯民族运动的胜利，对消灭帝国主义制度和结束帝国主义控制的斗争有着重要意义。伊拉克共和国的诞生是自由阿拉伯民族主义发展中的重要转折点。伊拉克革命摧毁了一个帝国主义控制的强大的政权。它最近又在从事铲除长期以来深入于生活各个方面的帝国主义根子的工作。
    电台回顾了自由阿拉伯民族主义曾经面临赤裸裸的帝国主义同以色列的侵略，以及帝国主义采取的威胁和不断施加压力，包括经济封锁等形式的侵略。但是，由于阿拉伯人民的团结一致，这些侵略都没有得逞。电台接着指出，帝国主义发觉伊拉克共和国是一个不受驾驭的力量，它为保卫自由阿拉伯民族主义同帝国主义较量。于是帝国主义又采取了愚笨的老办法，这就是进行阴谋，歪曲自由阿拉伯民族主义的真相，把它的阴谋涂上民族主义的色彩，用歪曲了的民族口号作幌子来进行欺骗，并且设法破坏伊拉克各族人民和爱国力量的团结，以及伊拉克同一切阿拉伯人民的团结。在这个隐蔽的攻势下，帝国主义进行了威胁伊拉克共和国生存的阴谋。
    电台强调说，但是，伟大的伊拉克人民和他们的英勇陆军在卡塞姆总理的领导下继续胜利前进，坚决走解放、民主和自由的革命道路。
    电台指出，伊拉克共和国采取了粉碎帝国主义支持的反动政权和实行土地改革的政策，并且采取了在依靠人民意志的基础上解决一切问题的道路。卡塞姆曾经强调指出，政权的形式和方针只能由人民来决定。没有一种力量能够把它的意志强加于伊拉克人民。任何使伊拉克放弃这条道路的企图都将被人民揭露。最终的胜利必将归于伟大的伊拉克人民。
    新华社布达佩斯19日电  据匈牙利通讯社讯：伊拉克政府发言人8日对匈牙利通讯社驻阿拉伯国家记者丹尼什谈到最近伊拉克政府破获的阴谋案件时说，阴谋分子的目的是企图推翻共和国政权，并且剥夺伊拉克人民的胜利果实。发言人说，由于伊拉克人民的警惕和卡塞姆总理的英明，终于粉碎了共和国敌人的阴谋。
    发言人在谈到美国同伊朗准备缔结一项新的军事协定时说，我们的政策是建立在和平共处和中立的基础上的，因此我们谴责美国同其它国家签订军事协定。他又说，事实上，这些军事协定只能威胁一些小国的利益，并且把它们沦为帝国主义大国的卫星国。
    在谈到伊拉克政府对巴格达条约的态度时，发言人指出，伊拉克政府还没有对前政权缔结的巴格达条约正式表示态度。但是，我们现在已经可以肯定说，中立和忠实执行联合国宪章，就足以保证中东的和平。
    在谈到联合国重新把“匈牙利问题”列入议程时，发言人明确指出，伊拉克人民对帝国主义者的手段已经有了丰富的经验。帝国主义者在匈牙利问题上采取的手段，便是一个典型例子。我们深信，匈牙利人民的民主制度是代表匈牙利人民的真正意愿的。
    关于伊拉克人民抗议美国助理国务卿朗特里的“访问”，发言人解释说：我们主张民主和言论自由。因此，我国人民和我们的报纸在美国助理国务卿访问时，表示了他们真正的态度。不过，我们是主张就一些问题进行讨论的，因此我们表示准备在巴格达接待朗特里。
    发言人在答复另一问题时，重申了伊拉克政府愿意同所有的国家友好相处的意愿。他说，同社会主义国家已经签订的和将要签订的经济和文化协定，体现了在这方面采取的积极步骤。
    发言人最后说，伊拉克政府准备采用短期的计划来解决一些社会和经济问题，同时也在准备国家工业化的长期计划。他说，我们深信，一切重大的决定都取决于人民。我们首要的目的是巩固共和国，并加强伊拉克人民的团结。
