　　The Destructive Power of Water Underground
　　Shigong
　　Water underground, just like on the surface, never ceases its destruction of rocks. It dissolves the soluble substances in the rocks. In particular, because groundwater dissolves a lot of carbon dioxide, it has a greater dissolving ability than surface water. Rock salt, gypsum, and limestone can all be dissolved in large quantities by it, forming cavities underground. Some of these cavities can be hundreds of miles long. In these caves, groundwater can accumulate, forming underground rivers and seas. When the top of the cave becomes thinner and thinner and cannot withstand the pressure from the ground, it will collapse. Therefore, when constructing major projects such as railways and dams in limestone areas, it is necessary to understand the underground karst cave conditions, otherwise, dangers may occur.
　　In the limestone mountains, you can often see many caves with springs flowing out. When the spring water flows to the ground, the pressure it is subjected to decreases, just like opening a soda bottle, and many bubbles appear in the water, with a lot of carbon dioxide escaping. At this time, the dissolving ability of the water is reduced, and some of the limestone substances that were originally dissolved in the water come out and gather on the cave walls, creating stalactites and stalagmites. These stalactites have various strange shapes. In the past, people did not understand the reason for their formation, so they used superstition and mythology to explain this phenomenon, saying that these things were utensils used by immortals or the remains of dragons. In fact, they are nothing more than substances with the same composition as limestone.
　　Due to the activity of groundwater, peculiar landforms have been created in areas where limestone is distributed. "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world," thanks to the destruction of the limestone there by groundwater.
　　Groundwater not only destroys rocks, but it also causes large areas of rock strata to slide. When groundwater seeps into the rock, the weight increases. That is to say, the driving force for sliding down the slope increases, while at the same time, because of the water, the frictional resistance to sliding decreases. In addition, groundwater moves downwards under the action of gravity, which increases the downward sliding pressure. Coupled with other factors, large areas of rock strata will slide. This poses a threat to railways, mines, and other major buildings. For example, the rock sliding in the Fushun West Open-pit Mine has been very serious. In the early days of liberation, the area of rock sliding in the mining area had reached more than two thousand meters in length, and the fallen rocks, like small mountains, divided the complete mining area into two halves, making more than five million tons of coal unminable. After clarifying the groundwater situation with the help of Soviet experts, they began to excavate a large water diversion tunnel, which can fundamentally solve the landslide problem.
　　We are not helpless in the face of this huge destructive force. First of all, when constructing buildings, we can try to avoid this dangerous area. In addition, we can also try to drain groundwater and inject cement into the sliding cracks to stop the sliding.
　　Groundwater seeps down from the ground, but sometimes it turns back and rises to the ground. In arid areas, the moisture on the ground evaporates quickly. At this time, if the groundwater level is very close to the ground, it can rise to the ground along the tiny pores in the soil like oil rising along a lamp wick. This is called capillary action. While rising, it also carries the dissolved salts and alkalis to the surface. Later, the water evaporates continuously, but the salt and alkali substances remain in the soil. The more it accumulates, the more the soil becomes salinized. In some areas of Xinjiang, too much irrigation in the past not only wasted water, but also caused a large amount of water to seep into the ground, raising the groundwater level and causing severe soil salinization. In this case, we must try to lower the groundwater level and cut off the channels for groundwater to rise. More hoeing and spreading sand can cut off the rising channels. In this regard, the creations of our working farmers are much richer than the knowledge in books.

    水在地下的破坏力
    石工
    水在地下，和在地面一样，一刻也没有停止过对岩石的破坏。它将石头中可以溶解的物质溶掉，特别是因为地下水溶解了许多碳酸气，比地面水有着更大的溶解能力，像岩盐、石膏、石灰岩这些东西，都可被它大量溶解掉，在地下形成空洞。这种空洞，有的可长达数百里。在这些洞穴中，可以蓄积地下水，形成地下河与地下海。当洞穴的顶部愈来愈薄，经受不住地面的压力时，就会塌陷。因此，在石灰岩地区修筑重大工程如铁路、水坝时，就得摸清地下溶洞的情况，否则会发生危险。
    在石灰岩形成的大山中，常可以见到许多有泉水流出的洞穴。当泉水流到地面的时候，受到的压力减轻了，就像汽水瓶揭开了盖子一样，水里出现许多气泡，碳酸气跑了不少。这时水的溶解的能力就降低了，一些原来溶在水中的石灰岩物质，便跑了出来，聚集在洞壁，造成石钟乳和石笋。这些石钟乳具有各种奇怪的形状，过去人们不了解它形成的原因，便用迷信和神话来解释这种现象。说这些东西是仙人用的器物或是龙的遗体。其实这不过是和石灰岩一样成分的东西而已。
    由于地下水的活动，在石灰岩分布的地区造成了奇特的地形。“桂林山水甲天下”，就得力于地下水对那里的石灰岩进行了破坏。
    地下水不仅破坏着岩石，它还使大片的岩层滑动。当岩石中渗入了地下水后，重量就增加了。也就是说沿着斜坡下滑的动力加大，而同时，因为有了水滑动受到的摩擦阻力却减小了。此外，地下水是受着重力作用向下运动的，因为增加了向下滑动的压力，再加上其他一些因素，岩层就会大片地滑动。这就造成了对铁路、矿井以及其他重大建筑物的威胁。如抚顺西露天矿，岩石滑动的情况一直很严重。解放初期，矿区内岩石滑落的面积已达到二千多公尺长，落下来的岩石像小山一样，把完整的矿区隔为两半，使五百多万吨煤采不出来。在苏联专家帮助下弄清了地下水的情况后，就着手开凿一条大输水巷道，便能使滑坡问题得到根本解决。
    对于这种巨大的破坏力，我们并不是束手无策的。首先，在进行建筑的时候，可以设法避开这个危险的地带。另外，我们也可设法宣泄地下水，以及在滑动的裂缝中灌注水泥等方法来制止滑动。
    地下水是从地面向下渗进去的，但有时它却回过头来向地面上升。在干旱地区，地面的水分蒸发很快，这时地下水的水面如果离地面很近，就可以像油沿着灯草上升一样，沿着土壤中细微的孔道上升到地面，这叫作毛细管作用。在上升的同时，还将它已溶解的盐类、碱类物质也带到地面上来。以后水分不断蒸发了，盐碱物质却在土壤中留了下来。这样愈积愈多，土壤就盐碱化了。新疆有些地方，过去因为灌水太多，不但浪费了水，还因大量的水渗入地下，使地下水的水面升高，造成土壤严重盐碱化。对于这种情况，我们就要设法降低地下水的水面，截断地下水上升的孔道。多锄地、铺砂田，则可以截断上升的孔道。在这方面，我国劳动农民的创造要远比书本上的知识丰富得多。
