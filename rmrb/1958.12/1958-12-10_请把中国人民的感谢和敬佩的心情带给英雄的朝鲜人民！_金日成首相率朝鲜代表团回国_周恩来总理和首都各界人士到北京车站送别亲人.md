Xinhua News Agency, December 9th. The beloved Premier Kim Il-sung and all the distinguished guests of the Korean Government Delegation, after concluding their visit to our country, left Beijing by special train at 9:30 this morning to return home. Thousands upon thousands of people from all walks of life in the capital gathered at the Beijing Railway Station, seeing off the distinguished guests like family members, with boundless admiration for the leader of the Korean people and the heroic Korean people.

Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders of our country in Beijing went to the station to see them off. Premier Zhou and Premier Kim delivered speeches at the station, warmly expressing the comradely friendship between the two peoples.

The Premier pointed out that the friendship and unity of the two peoples who share weal and woe will continue to play a great role in the common struggle against imperialist aggression, for the defense of peace and the construction of socialism in the future. The Premier also praised the friendship between the two peoples, saying: "Our imperialist enemies are common, and our socialist construction is also common. The majestic Changbai Mountain and the beautiful Yalu River closely link the peoples of our two countries. The fighting friendship between our two peoples will develop for generations to come, and poems praising the great friendship of internationalism between our two peoples will be immortalized in history!"

At the Beijing Railway Station, which was dressed in festive attire, the national flags of China and North Korea and countless colorful flags fluttered in the wind. Huge red banners with golden characters shone brightly in the bright winter sun: "Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people cemented with blood!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long live world peace!" At about 9 o'clock, Premier Zhou Enlai and others accompanied Premier Kim Il-sung, Vice-Chairman Park Jung-ai, Foreign Minister Nam Il, Minister of National Defense Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of Education and Culture Li Il-gyeong, Ambassador Li Yong-ho, and others to the Beijing Railway Station by car.

As the distinguished guests slowly entered the station platform, the crowd cheering them on both sides waved colorful flags and bouquets, shouting slogans such as "Long live Premier Kim Il-sung" and "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people," warmly hailing the great contribution made by Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean Government Delegation to further developing the friendship between the two peoples.

Premier Zhou first delivered a speech to bid farewell to the distinguished guests. He once again thanked Comrade Kim Il-sung and all the comrades of the delegation for their visit, and asked the distinguished guests to bring the brotherly friendship of the 650 million Chinese people to the fraternal Korean people. The Premier emphasized: "More than sixty years of history, especially the history of the past forty years, proves that in the common struggle between the Chinese and Korean peoples, the support and assistance given to the Chinese people by the Korean people is greater than the support and assistance given to the Korean people by the Chinese people. Now, the Korean people stand firmly on the eastern forefront of defending the socialist camp, making unremitting efforts to defend the Far East and world peace." "At this moment of parting, I would like to ask Comrade Premier and the Korean Government Delegation to convey to the heroic Korean people the Chinese people's gratitude and respect for the Korean people."

Premier Kim Il-sung said in his speech: "We will convey the deep friendship of the Chinese people to our people; and will tell them about the great achievements you have made in socialist construction. This will further inspire our people who have mounted the Chollima and are heading towards socialism." "We are glad to believe that the visit of our government delegation to your country will contribute to further strengthening the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China." The Premier emphatically pointed out: "The friendship and unity of our two peoples, who share weal and woe, is unbreakable. This friendship and unity will continue to play a great role in our common struggle against imperialist aggression, for the defense of peace and for the cause of socialism in the future."

Premier Kim Il-sung finally shouted in Chinese: "Comrades, goodbye!"

The enthusiastic speeches of Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung aroused bursts of warm applause in the crowd.
