    To Build Socialism and Establish a New Attitude Towards Labor
    Taiyuan Strengthens Ideological Education for New Workers

    (Our dispatch) Taiyuan City's factories and mines are strengthening communist ideological education for new workers. After clarifying "for whom to work," some factory's new workers have launched a "Seven Goods" and "Four Diligences" competition.

    From April to October this year, apprentice workers newly added to eleven units in Taiyuan City, such as the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant and Heavy Machinery Plant, accounted for 37.78% of the total number of employees in these units. The vast majority of these apprentice workers from rural areas, schools, and employee families are actively working hard, but some apprentice workers also show freedom and looseness in their work, preferring ease and disliking difficulty, fearing dirt and fatigue, being concerned about treatment, picking and choosing types of work, and not observing labor discipline. For example, among the twenty-one new apprentice workers assigned to the smelting and forging sections of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, many disliked the "unpromising" nature of casting and forging work, were unwilling to do it, and were late or left early. This has brought some difficulties to the factory's production leap forward and management work.

    The Party committees of various factories and mining enterprises believe that the main reasons for these ideas are: new workers do not have a clear understanding of the fundamental question of for whom they are working, and the ideology of small producers and individualism are at play. In order to enable them to better undertake the great cause of socialist construction and to eliminate non-proletarian thoughts as soon as possible, all units decided to vigorously strengthen the political and ideological education of new workers. They also made the general line and the beautiful prospects of communism, the domestic and international situation, and the glory of labor as the main content of education. All units have made specific arrangements for study time. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant adopted the method of half-work and half-study, with the workshop as a unit, and formed batches in shifts without affecting production, with half a day for production and half a day for training. Leading cadres from the factory, workshop, Party, government, labor union, and Youth League systematically gave lectures to improve the apprentice workers' understanding of some basic issues; and old workers were invited to give reports and explain the history of the working class's struggle to the new apprentice workers; mass self-education through great debates and full airing of views was also organized.

    After more than two months of political and ideological education, the new workers in various factories and mines have initially established a communist attitude towards labor and enhanced their labor viewpoints. Those who were originally not content with their work and picked and chose their jobs are now working hard and studying technology. Some have even become activists in production.

    Apprentice workers from various factories and mines also organized competitions with each other to promote each other. The fourteen apprentice workers of the Third Work Zone of the Twelfth Workshop of the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant jointly wrote a letter of determination to the Party organization, and launched a "Seven Goods" (good in thought, good in work, good in study, good in unity, good in obeying assignments, good in respecting the master, good in participating in social activities) and "Four Diligences" (diligent in mouth, diligent in legs, diligent in hands, diligent in eyes) competition among all apprentice workers in the workshop.

    为了建设社会主义  树立新的劳动态度
    太原加强新工人的思想教育
    本报讯  太原市各厂矿企业正在加强对新工人的共产主义思想教育。有些厂的新工人在明确了“为谁劳动”以后，掀起了“七好”、“四勤”的竞赛运动。
    太原市山西机床厂，重型机器厂等十一个单位，今年4至10月新增加的学徒工占这些单位职工总数的37.78％。这批来自农村、学校、职工家属等方面的学徒工，绝大部分人都是积极苦干的，也有部分徒工在工作中表现自由散漫，喜轻厌重，嫌脏怕累，计较待遇，拣挑工种，不遵守劳动纪律。比如太原矿山机器厂分配在熔铸、锻铁工段的二十一名新徒工中，就有不少人嫌铸锻活“没出息”，不愿干，迟到早退。这给厂矿的生产跃进和管理工作带来了一些困难。
    各厂矿企业党委认为产生这些思想的主要原因是：新工人对为谁劳动这一根本问题没有明确认识，小生产者和个人主义的思想意识在作祟。为了使他们更好地担负起伟大的社会主义的建设事业，尽快地消除非无产阶级思想，各单位决定大力加强对新工人的政治思想教育工作。并把总路线和共产主义的美好远景、国内外形势，以及劳动光荣等作为教育的主要内容。各单位都具体安排了学习时间。太原矿山机器厂采取半工半读的办法，以车间为单位，在不影响生产的情况下，分批组成班次，半日生产，半日训练。由厂、车间、党、政、工、团领导干部系统地讲课，提高学徒工对一些基本问题的认识；并且请老工人给新徒工作报告、讲解工人阶级斗争历史；组织大鸣大放、大辩论的群众自我教育。
    经过两个多月的政治思想教育，各厂矿的新工人已初步树立了共产主义的劳动态度，增强了劳动观点。原来不安心工作、挑肥拣瘦的人，现在已埋头苦干、钻研技术了。有的还成为生产上的积极分子。
    各厂矿单位的学徒工还互相组织竞赛，互相促进。山西机床厂十二车间三工区的十四名学徒工联名向党组织写了决心书，并且向全车间徒工发起了开展“七好”（思想好、工作好、学习好、团结好、服从分配好、尊敬师傅好、参加社会活动好）“四勤”（嘴勤、腿勤、手勤、眼勤）的竞赛运动。
