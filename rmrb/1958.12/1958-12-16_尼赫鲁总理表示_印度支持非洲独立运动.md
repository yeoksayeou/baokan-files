Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 15th: Prime Minister Nehru, in his opening statement at the Federal Council (Indian Upper House) debate on foreign policy today, stated that India fully supports the national independence movements in Africa and supports Algeria in gaining freedom.

He said that the gradual development of the "African character" is welcome, and if colonial countries do not recognize Africa's demand for freedom, a "huge conflict" will occur.

Nehru pointed out that the United Nations vote on the proposal by the seventeen Asian and African countries regarding the Algerian issue was a "huge moral victory achieved by Algeria." He also hoped that the French government would address this issue and recognize Algerian independence.

Nehru condemned South Africa's apartheid policy, stating that India is prepared to hold talks with the South African government on this issue in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions.

Regarding relations with Pakistan, Nehru pointed out that India hopes Pakistan will be happy. He said that India does not want to participate in any military blocs. "Past experience has shown that military alliances such as the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have not played any positive role, not only for Pakistan but also for other Asian countries. These alliances have brought insecurity to the region and have often caused conflict."

Nehru expressed gratitude to Indonesia for the grand welcome extended to Indian President Prasad, who is currently visiting there, and said that Prasad's visit will strengthen relations between the two countries.

    尼赫鲁总理表示
    印度支持非洲独立运动
    新华社新德里15日电  尼赫鲁总理今天在联邦院（印度上议院）开始就外交政策进行辩论时首先发言，他表示印度完全支持非洲的民族独立运动和支持阿尔及利亚获得自由。
    他说，“非洲的特性”的逐渐发展是受人欢迎的，如果殖民国家不承认非洲对于自由的要求，就会发生“巨大的冲突”。
    尼赫鲁指出，联合国就亚非十七国关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案进行的表决是“阿尔及利亚所取得的道义上的巨大胜利”。他还希望法国政府将处理这个问题，承认阿尔及利亚独立。
    尼赫鲁谴责南非的种族隔离政策，他说，印度准备根据联合国的有关决议来同南非政府就这个问题举行会谈。
    关于同巴基斯坦的关系问题，尼赫鲁指出，印度希望巴基斯坦得到幸福。他说，印度不想参加任何军事集团，“过去的经验证明，不仅对巴基斯坦说来而且对于亚洲其他国家说来，巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织这种军事联盟丝毫没有起过什么好作用，这种联盟给这个地区带来了不安全的局面，而且还常常造成冲突”。
    尼赫鲁表示感谢印度尼西亚对正在那里进行访问的印度总统普拉沙德的盛大欢迎，他说，普拉沙德的这次访问将加强两国之间的关系。
