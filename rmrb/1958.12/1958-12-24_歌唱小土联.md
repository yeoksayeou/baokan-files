Singing Praises of Small-Scale Indigenous Integrated Iron and Steel Production

　　I. Phoenixes emerge from chicken coops, indigenous steel surpasses foreign steel; indigenous steel is rolled into materials, indigenous steel manufactures machine tools. Refute the doubters, dare to say it is not useless! Communes are industrialized, arming themselves.

　　II. Hundreds of products, square steel and flat steel, round steel thick and thin, wire long and long; small screws and iron nails, each shining silver, many varieties, each with wide use.

　　III. Indigenous iron plus indigenous steel, railways connect town and country; rails are cast by ourselves, crisscrossing into lines; agricultural, sideline, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery products are loaded onto the trains, fast, good, and economical, people sing and the whistle sounds.

　　IV. Utensils of every kind are available, economical and convenient, no need to run to Wuhan, no need to go to Anshan; self-made small hardware, old houses exchanged for new houses; workers and peasants leap forward together, life gets stronger day by day.

    歌唱小土联
    一、鸡窝出凤凰，土钢赛洋钢；土钢轧成材，土钢制机床。驳倒怀疑派，敢说没用场！公社工业化，自己来武装。
    二、制品千百种，方钢与扁钢，圆钢分粗细，线材长又长；螺丝小铁钉，个个闪银光，花样品种多，件件用途广。
    三、土铁加土钢，铁路连城乡；铁轨自己铸，交错又成行；农副林牧渔，产品车上装，多快又好省，人歌汽笛响。
    四、用具样样有，经济又便当，不必跑武汉，不必上鞍钢；自造小五金，旧房换新房；工农齐跃进，生活日日强。
