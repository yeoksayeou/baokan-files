    Why is it so hard to part?
    Zhong Liqing, Downward-bound cadre from Inner Mongolia
    We were eating the farewell dinner. There was delicious mutton on the table, and fried yellow rice cakes with white sugar on them, which were so rare in the countryside! But it didn't taste pleasant or sweet. After the meal, the township general branch secretary said to us, "When you leave tomorrow, some villagers may cry, and some may try to stop the car, but after our repeated explanations to the masses, they will let you go."
    His words touched the heartstrings of each of us. We thought of many things from the past ten months. We labored with the villagers. They carried manure and ran fast in front, and we followed closely behind. They dug soil underground, and we received the soil above ground. They held the seed drill behind, and we pulled the oxen in front. When it was dry, and we saw some seedlings wilting, we were all uneasy; when we watered the seedlings back to life, we were exceptionally excited. When the flood suddenly struck, we jumped into the water together and used our bodies to block it, not allowing the flood to damage the crops, and even letting it irrigate our fields. When the crops matured, they reaped in front, and we followed behind. Seeing that we were falling too far behind, they reaped back from the front, and we joined together again. At night, we often held meetings together, studying how to win the red flag until late at night. In the spring, many of them had no confidence in learning, but now, we have helped them all remove the illiteracy label. Usually, if some of them fell ill in the middle of the night, we immediately ran twenty *li* away to get a doctor. When we returned from meetings that lasted for ten days, they had even saved us mutton and mooncakes for the festival…
    Tell me, how can we separate so suddenly?

    为什么这样难舍难分
    内蒙古下放干部  钟力青
    我们吃着欢送的酒，桌上有肥美的羊肉，有油炸的放上白糖的黄米糕，这在农村是多么难得的呀！但吃起来不愉快，也不甜。饭后，乡总支书记对我们说：“明天你们走时，可能有老乡哭，也可能有人拦着车，但是经过我们向群众再三解释，他们是会放你们走的。”
    他的话打动了我们每个人的心弦。我们想起了这十个多月来的许多事。我们同老乡们一起劳动，他们担着粪在前面飞跑，我们担着在后面紧跟。他们在井下挖土，我们在井上接土。他们在后面把着耧，我们在前面拉着牛。天旱了，眼看有些禾苗枯萎，我们彼此内心不安；用水把苗浇活了，我们又异常兴奋。洪水猛然袭来，我们一起跳下水去用身子堵住，不准洪水冲坏庄稼，还让它给我们浇了地。庄稼成熟了，他们在前面割，我们在后面跟，眼看拉下太远，他们又从前面割回来，我们又接在一起。夜晚，我们常在一起开会，直至深夜还在一起研究如何夺红旗。春天，他们许多人对学习还无信心，而今，我们都帮助他们把文盲帽子摘掉了。平时，他们中有的半夜生疾病，我们立即跑到二十里外去给请医生。我们开会十几天回来，他们还给留着过节的羊肉和月饼……
    你说，叫我们怎么能一下子分离呢？
