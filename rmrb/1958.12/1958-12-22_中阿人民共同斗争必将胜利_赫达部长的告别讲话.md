Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: The full text of Ben Youssef Ben Khedda's speech at the Beijing airport when the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria left China:

Your Excellency Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi:

    As we leave the People's Republic of China, I would like to express, on behalf of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, our gratitude to the Chinese people and government for the warm and brotherly welcome extended to us. We are well aware that this welcome is directly extended to the heroic Algerian people who have been fighting for national independence for more than four years.

    In all our contacts, especially with the leaders of the People's Republic of China, we have encountered a deep understanding and sympathy for the Algerian cause.

    We have been assured that the great Chinese people will continue to stand by our side in the future. Your Excellency Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi announced that "In the years to come, the Algerian people can always count on the firm support of the 650 million Chinese people."

    During our visit to China, we also witnessed the great construction work carried out by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of their leaders and the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. Great achievements have been made in industry, agriculture, and science. We are deeply convinced that your progress will increase day by day, and your "Great Leap Forward" will surely be realized victoriously. We wish the Chinese people prosperity, peace, and happiness in restoring national unity.

    The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria hopes that there will be more contacts between China and Algeria in the future, so as to strengthen the friendly relations that already exist between the two peoples. Our common struggle against imperialism is combined with international solidarity against colonialism; the day of our victory is coming.

    Long live the national independence of all peoples!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!

    Long live world peace!

    赫达部长的告别讲话
    新华社21日讯  本·优素福·本·赫达在阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团离开中国时在北京机场上的讲话，全文如下：陈毅副总理兼外交部长阁下：
    在离开中华人民共和国的时候，我代表阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团对中国人民和政府给予我们的热烈的和兄弟般的欢迎表示感谢。我们很清楚地知道，这种欢迎是直接给予为争取民族独立而战斗了四年多的英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的。
    在我们的一切接触，首先是同中华人民共和国领导人的接触中，我们遇到了对于阿尔及利亚的事业的深切了解和同情。
    我们得到了保证，伟大的中国人民今后将仍然站在我们这一边。陈毅副总理兼外交部长阁下宣布说，“在今后的岁月里，阿尔及利亚人民永远可以指望六亿五千万中国人民对他们的坚决支持。”
    在中国访问的期间，我们也看到了中国人民在他们的英明的领导人和毛泽东主席的光辉领导下所进行的巨大的建设工作。在工业、农业和科学方面，已经取得了极大的成绩。我们深信，你们的进步会与日俱增，你们的“跃进”一定会胜利实现。我们祝中国人民，在恢复国家统一的情况下，获得昌盛、安宁和幸福。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团希望中阿之间今后会有更多的接触，从而加强两国人民之间已经存在的友好关系。我们反对帝国主义的共同斗争是同反殖民主义的国际团结结合在一起的；我们斗争胜利的日子就要来临了。
    各国人民的民族独立万岁！
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
