    Promote Electroslag Welding
    Currently, one of the major problems hindering the accelerated manufacturing of heavy machinery is the insufficient supply of large blanks. The adoption of the new electroslag welding technology can most effectively solve this problem.
    Electroslag welding is a new welding method that has emerged in the world in recent years. China began using it in Harbin Boiler Factory in 1956. However, because modern electroslag welding equipment is very complex in structure and requires specialized technical expertise to master, despite the obvious advantages of electroslag welding in machine manufacturing, everyone could only sigh and feel helpless.
    Recently, many factories, universities, and research institutions across the country have broken down superstitions, creatively mastered this new technology through a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and rapidly applied it to production. The electric furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has a capacity of only three tons. However, by using electroslag welding, they created a rolling mill stand weighing twenty-seven tons. The Harbin Electric Machinery Factory used electroslag welding to manufacture giant main shafts with a diameter of more than one meter. Moreover, not only can cast steel and forged steel be welded using electroslag welding technology, but nodular cast iron and gray cast iron can also be welded and repaired. These facts completely shattered people's mysterious view of this new technology, proving that advanced technology can also be mastered using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. However, the development of this brand-new welding technology still requires strong support from relevant parties to quickly realize its potential.
    First of all, product design departments and machine users are accustomed to traditional structural designs and still have doubts about using welded structures. Some heavy machinery manufacturing plants with large-scale cast steel and forged steel production capabilities do not pay enough attention to this new technology. In addition, some people, while recognizing the advantages of electroslag welding, are superstitious about foreign equipment and methods, and hold a distrustful and critical attitude towards domestic equipment. They do not understand that the development process of new things always progresses from rough to refined, from low to high, and from imperfect to gradually complete.
    We hope that all relevant units will continue to break down superstitions about foreign methods and foreign equipment, boldly mobilize the masses, and work together to create conditions to widely master and apply this new technology. It is foreseeable that when the masses have mastered this technology, small and medium-sized factories will undertake more heavy machinery manufacturing tasks, and large factories will have the conditions to take it to the next level, manufacturing more and larger heavy machinery. After adopting methods such as "ants gnawing at bones" and "building block machine tools" to solve the problem of processing large parts, the situation of insufficient supply of large blanks may be completely resolved in the shortest possible time.

    推广电渣焊
    目前，加速制造重型机器面临的重大问题之一是大毛坯供不应求。而采用电渣焊接新技术，就可以最有效地解决这个问题。
    电渣焊是世界上最近几年才出现的一种新的焊接方法。我国1956年在哈尔滨锅炉厂开始使用。但由于现代化的电渣焊设备构造十分复杂，掌握它要有专门技术，所以尽管电渣焊用于机器制造的优越性十分明显，但是大家只好望“洋”兴叹，无能为力。
    最近，全国有不少工厂、高等学校和研究机构，破除迷信，用土洋结合的办法创造性地掌握了这门新技术，并且迅速地用于生产。石景山钢铁厂的电炉，容量只有三吨。但是他们使用电渣焊的办法，却造成了一台重二十七吨的轧钢机架。哈尔滨电机厂用电渣焊方法制成直径一公尺以上的巨型主轴。而且，不仅铸钢锻钢可以用电渣焊技术焊接，就是球墨铸铁和灰口铁也可以焊接、焊补。这些事实，彻底打破了人们对这门新技术的神秘观点，证明用土洋结合的办法，同样可以掌握尖端技术。但是，这门崭新的焊接技术的发展还需要有关方面大力支持，才能迅速发挥它的作用。
    首先，产品设计部门和使用机器，过去习惯于传统的结构设计，对采用焊接结构，还有怀疑。有些拥有大型铸钢和锻钢生产能力的重型机器制造厂，对这门新技术还不够重视。另外，有些人虽然认识到电渣焊的优越性，但迷信洋设备，洋办法，对土设备抱着不信任的态度，挑剔指摘。他们不了解新事物的发展过程总是由粗到精，由低到高，由不完备到逐渐完备的。
    我们希望各个有关单位，继续破除对洋办法洋设备的迷信，放手发动群众，大家动手创造条件，广泛地掌握和运用这门新技术。可以预见，当群众掌握了这门技术以后，中小型工厂将担负起更多的重型机器制造任务，大型工厂将有条件更上一层楼，制造更多更大的重型机器。在采用了“蚂蚁啃骨头”“积木式机床”等方法解决大机件加工的问题以后，大型毛胚供不应求的局面，将有可能在最短时间内得到彻底解决。
