Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: The Ministry of Light Industry recently convened a National Light Industry Planning Conference in Jinan, determining that in 1959, under the guidance of the principle of "taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward," light industry production and construction must take two paths simultaneously, namely, focusing on people's communes running industry and technological revolution to launch mass movements on a large scale, striving to overfulfill the state plan.

The conference believed that light industry production had made significant progress this year. It is estimated that the annual output of machine-made paper will reach 1.23 million tons, an increase of 35% compared to last year; sugar 1.18 million tons, an increase of 36% compared to last year; crude salt 10.17 million tons, an increase of 23% compared to last year; alcohol 120,000 tons, an increase of 90%. Other products of the food industry and daily necessities industry have also seen significant development. The output value of just thirty major light industry products is expected to increase by about 50% compared to last year. New light industry products have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain, with a large number of successful trials. The paper industry alone has 162 new products, and the quality of many products has caught up with and surpassed international standards.

The conference believed that the main reason for the great leap forward in light industry production this year was the implementation of the policy of simultaneously promoting "large modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction. Because the masses were boldly mobilized, and a wide range of technological innovation movements were launched, the production potential of existing light industry factories was brought into full play. The paper industry saw more than 170 advanced experiences, with improvements and innovations in the entire process from material preparation, pulping, papermaking to finished product packaging. The salt industry has achieved important successes in carrying out tool reforms and improving on-site transportation efficiency. Due to the in-depth technological innovation movement, the silicate industry has found ways to achieve full mechanization and partial automation. The ceramics industry made important contributions in the technological innovation movement, creating various equipment that replaced steel with ceramics.

The conference pointed out that in this year's light industry construction, due to the implementation of the policy of focusing on medium and small-sized enterprises, running small factories on a large scale; and focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, the "small indigenous group" movement has been widely carried out, and small light industry factories have sprung up everywhere. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, the country has added no less than two million medium and small-sized light industry factories and small production units. It is estimated that at least 300,000 of them have been rectified, consolidated, and become permanent production factories. More than 4,000 small sugar factories with a daily processing capacity of five tons of sugar beets have been added. The construction and commissioning of many medium and small-sized factories has not only increased the output of light industry products but has also effectively overcome the difficulties of insufficient steel materials, equipment manufacturing, power, transportation, and labor in light industry construction, playing a significant role in supporting the "marshal" of steel production.

After studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and analyzing the objective situation of light industry, the conference believed that in order to meet the needs of all sectors for light industry products, the light industry departments, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, must use all favorable conditions to continue to exert great effort and strive to overfulfill the state plan. In order to achieve this task, the conference believed that in next year's light industry production and construction, it is necessary to resolutely implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continue to implement the policy of simultaneously promoting "small indigenous groups" and "large modern groups," and seize the time this winter and spring, focusing on people's communes running industry and technological revolution, to carry out mass movements more deeply.

The conference believed that in order to implement the above policies and complete next year's production tasks, the light industry departments should take the following measures: First, summarize and promote the experience of people's communes running industry on a large scale; second, strengthen specific leadership in production technology, further mobilize the masses to carry out technological revolution movements, and give full play to the production capacity of existing equipment. And pay attention to caring for the material and cultural life of the workers; third, improve design work and save a large amount of steel; fourth, rely on our own efforts to solve the manufacturing of light industry equipment; fifth, widely organize cooperation. Regions and industries should widely exchange information and share resources.

Based on next year's light industry production tasks, the conference studied the planned targets for major products and made preliminary arrangements for issues such as raw material supply.

The conference was attended by 150 representatives from light industry departments and bureaus of provinces and cities and relevant departments. The conference was chaired by Deng Jie, Vice Minister of Light Industry, who made a concluding speech at the end of the conference; Song Naide, Vice Minister of Light Industry, also gave instructions at the meeting.

    为改善人民生活提供物质条件
    轻工业一年建厂三十万座
    明年方针：以公社办工业和技术革命为中心大搞群众运动
    据新华社24日讯  轻工业部最近在济南召开了全国轻工业计划会议，确定1959年在“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针指导下，轻工业的生产和建设必须用两条腿走路，即以人民公社办工业和技术革命为中心大搞群众运动，力争超额完成国家计划。
    会议认为今年轻工业生产有很大的发展。预计全年机制纸产量可达一百二十三万吨，比去年增长35％；糖一百十八万吨，比去年增长36％；原盐一千零十七万吨，比去年增长23％，酒精十二万吨，增长90％。食品工业和日用品工业的其他产品，也有很大发展，仅三十种主要的轻工业产品的产值，预计将比去年增长50％左右。轻工业的新产品也如雨后春笋，大批试制成功。仅造纸工业就有一百六十二种新产品，不少产品的质量都赶上和超过了国际水平。
    会议认为，今年轻工业生产大跃进的主要原因，是在党的社会主义建设总路线指引下，贯彻执行了“大洋群”和“小土群”同时并举的方针。由于放手发动群众，广泛开展了技术革新运动，发挥了现有轻工业工厂的生产潜力，造纸工业出现了一百七十多项先进经验，从备料、制浆、抄纸到成品包装，整个工艺过程都有改进和革新。制盐工业在大搞工具改革、提高场内运输效率方面取得了重要成就。硅酸盐工业由于深入开展了技术革新运动，已找到了实现全面机械化和部分自动化的途径。在技术革新运动中，陶瓷工业作出了重要贡献，创造了陶瓷代替钢铁的多种设备。
    会议指出，今年轻工业在建设中，由于贯彻了中、小型为主，大办小厂；以土法为主，土洋结合的方针，广泛开展了“小土群”运动，轻工业小厂已遍地开花。据不完全统计，一年来全国新增加的中、小型轻工业工厂和小的生产单位不下二百万个，其中经过整顿、巩固成为常年性生产的工厂估计至少在三十万个以上，仅日处理五吨甜菜的小型糖厂就增加了四千多个。许多中、小型工厂建成并投入生产，不仅增加了轻工业产品的产量，并有力地克服了轻工业建设中钢铁材料、设备制造、动力、交通运输、劳动力等方面不足的困难，对支援钢铁“元帅”升帐发挥了很大作用。
    会议在学习了中共八届六中全会文件，并分析了轻工业所处的客观形势以后认为，为满足各方面对轻工业产品的需要，轻工业部门在各级党委的领导下，必须利用一切有利条件，继续鼓足干劲，力争超额完成国家计划。为了实现这一任务，会议认为，明年轻工业在生产和建设中，要坚决贯彻党的八届六中全会的精神，继续实行“小土群”和“大洋群”同时并举的方针，抓紧今冬明春，以人民公社大办工业和技术革命为中心，更深入地开展群众运动。
    会议认为，为贯彻上述方针和完成明年生产任务，轻工业部门应当采取以下措施：一，总结和推广人民公社大办工业的经验；二，加强生产技术的具体领导，进一步发动群众开展技术革命运动，充分发挥现有设备的生产能力。并注意关心职工群众的物质和文化生活；三，改进设计工作，大量节约钢材；四，自力更生解决轻工业设备制造；五，广泛组织协作。地区之间和行业之间要广泛交流情况、互通有无。
    会议根据明年轻工业生产任务，研究了主要产品的计划指标，对原材料供应等问题，也作了初步安排。
    参加会议的有各省、市轻工业厅、局长和有关部门代表共一百五十人。会议由轻工业部邓洁副部长主持，他在会议结束时作了总结发言；轻工业部副部长宋乃德也在会上作了指示。
