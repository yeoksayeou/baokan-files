Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 26th:  Rumors have been circulating here for several days that the French franc is about to be devalued. The French cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister de Gaulle, held a late-night meeting today to discuss the matter. According to today's "France-Soir," Finance Minister Pinay will announce the decision on the franc's devaluation tomorrow afternoon.

    This devaluation will be carried out under the guise of a so-called currency reform. According to "France-Soir," the French government is preparing to issue a so-called "heavy franc," with each "heavy franc" equivalent to one hundred current francs. The exchange rate of the heavy franc against the dollar will be 4.9 to 1, which is equivalent to devaluing the current official franc rate of 420 francs to the dollar by about 15%.

    The news of the impending franc devaluation has caused a storm in Paris. On the free market, the price of the franc has fallen again and again. Today, it takes 480 francs to exchange for one dollar, and 560,000 francs to exchange for one kilogram of gold.

    In order to avoid further turmoil in the financial markets, the French government had to announce today the suspension of all foreign exchange trading until next Monday when the government announces the new franc exchange rate.

    Financial experts in Paris believe that the franc devaluation is intended to: 1. artificially enhance France's competitiveness in order to prepare for entry into the six-nation "Common Market" on New Year's Day; 2. counter possible retaliatory measures by Britain, which is said to be considering announcing some form of limited pound sterling convertibility in retaliation for being excluded from the "Common Market."

    Observers here believe that the relentless pursuit of an arms race and colonial wars has exhausted the French economy. Therefore, the de Gaulle government can only pin its hopes on the franc devaluation to increase its competitiveness with foreign countries. However, the devaluation will stimulate a sharp rise in domestic prices, thereby further reducing the purchasing power of workers.

    "Liberation" newspaper, in discussing the franc devaluation, believes that the government is trying to rely on the West German mark to consolidate the franc, perhaps even to make the franc dependent on the mark.

    "Combat" newspaper, on the other hand, said that the franc devaluation does not depend on Paris but on London. The newspaper pointed out that Britain is preparing to implement a limited degree of pound sterling convertibility and complained: "Our allies and friends in the dollar-sterling bloc seem to have not carefully, fairly, and thoroughly considered all the political aspects of this (pound sterling convertibility) action."

### 法国为了竞争不择手段  法郎即将贬值

    法国为了竞争不择手段
    法郎即将贬值
    新华社巴黎26日电  几天以来这里盛传法郎将要贬值。法国内阁在总理戴高乐主持下今天连夜举行了会议，讨论这个问题。据今天的“法兰西晚报”报道，财政部长比内将在明天下午宣布有关法郎贬值的决定。
    这次贬值将在所谓币制改革的形式下进行。据“法兰西晚报”说，法国政府准备发行一种所谓“重法郎”，每一“重法郎”合现在的一百法郎。重法郎对美元的兑换率是四点九比一，这就等于把现在的四百二十法郎兑换一美元的官定法郎牌价贬值15％左右。
    法郎要贬值的消息已经闹得巴黎满城风雨。在自由市场上，法郎的价格一跌再跌。今天已经要四百八十个法郎才能换到一个美元，要五十六万个法郎才能换到一公斤黄金。
    为了避免金融市场的进一步紊乱，法国政府今天不得不宣布停止一切外汇买卖，直到下星期一政府宣布了新的法郎兑换率时再行恢复。
    巴黎的财政专家认为，法郎贬值是为了：一、人为地增强法国的竞争力量，以便为明年元旦进入西欧六国“共同市场”作好准备；二、对付英国可能采取的报复措施，据说英国为了报复把英国排斥在外的“共同市场”的成立，可能要宣布有限制的某种英镑自由兑换。
    这里的观察家认为，不计一切后果地推行军备竞赛政策和殖民战争政策已经使法国经济精疲力尽，因此，戴高乐政府只能把增加同外国竞争力量的希望寄托在法郎贬值上，然而，贬值将刺激国内物价猛涨，从而使劳动者的购买力进一步下降。
    “解放报”谈到法郎贬值时认为，政府企图依靠西德马克来巩固法郎，也许甚至要使法郎依附马克。
    “战斗报”则说，法郎贬值不取决于巴黎而取决于伦敦。这家报纸指出英国准备实行有限程度的英镑自由兑换，并且抱怨说：“美元—英镑集团中的我们的盟国和朋友，看来没有仔细地、公平地和周到地考虑这一（英镑自由兑换）行动在政治上的各个方面。”
