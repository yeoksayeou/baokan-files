Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The head office of the People's Bank of China convened a national branch heads meeting in Wuhan from November 20th to December 11th. The meeting focused on discussing how banking credit and settlement work can serve to consolidate the people's communes and develop commune production under the current new situation of people's communization. It also discussed the management of working capital of state-owned enterprises, the implementation of a new credit management system, and the 1959 national credit plan.

Before the meeting concluded, Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke at the meeting.

The meeting preliminarily summarized the achievements and experiences of banking work in 1958. First, the estimated increase in people's savings deposits this year will be double the increase in 1957. At the same time, the absorption of people's commune deposits is expected to reach several billion yuan, which not only strengthens the national credit fund but also plays an important role in consolidating the people's communes and preparing production funds for next year. Second, the bank's issuance of various loans has timely met the needs for working capital in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of commercial operations. The increase in bank loans this year is equivalent to the total increase during the first five-year plan. Third, the rules and regulations have been reformed, which has facilitated enterprises and the masses.

The meeting believed that these achievements were mainly due to the Party's leadership and the bank cadres' adherence to putting politics in command and adhering to the mass line in their work.

The meeting believes that after the people's communization, the work tasks of the bank and the commune credit cooperatives have become heavier. Now that rural financial and trade institutions have been decentralized, the state has decentralized approximately 10 billion yuan of working capital to the communes for management and use. How to rationally use these working funds to support the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture in the communes, and to help commune-affiliated enterprises establish economic accounting, is the main task of the bank and commune credit cooperatives. The meeting pointed out that this winter and next spring, bank cadres should actively participate in the production and rectification movements, and seize the opportunity during the current peak market season to strive to recover overdue agricultural loans, absorb deposits, and recover advance purchase deposits to prepare funds for next year's large-scale production; at the same time, strive to improve the organization of the commune credit cooperatives, help commune-affiliated units establish and improve financial and credit management systems, so that credit becomes a powerful tool for consolidating and improving the people's communes. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the communes in managing working capital and tapping the potential of funds, the meeting decided to implement a differential contracting method for credit management of communes. That is, after the estimated results, if the commune's expected deposits are greater than the budgeted loans, the surplus funds will be deposited with the bank; if the expected loans are greater than the expected deposits, the insufficient part will be resolved by bank loans. Within the scope of differential contracting, if deposits increase more or loans are recovered more, more loans can be issued.

The meeting proposed that from January 1, 1959, all working capital needed by state-owned enterprises and joint state-private enterprises should be resolved by bank loans, that is, the fixed-amount working capital directly allocated by the financial authorities in the past should also be resolved by the bank in the form of loans. This method has been reported to the State Council for approval and issuance.

In order to adapt to the decentralization of the industrial, commercial, and financial systems, the meeting studied the specific issues of implementing a new credit management system in 1959. The meeting pointed out that after the decentralization of the credit management system, the basic principles of local credit funds should be: looking downward and relying on one's own efforts. When local credit exceeds the original plan and needs to increase loans, the source of funds mainly relies on organizing various deposits and local financial increases in credit funds, and the central government will subsidize a part when it is insufficient.

The meeting believes that in order to do a good job in banking and better serve the central tasks of the Party, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, improve the communist consciousness of cadres, clarify some confused ideas (such as thinking that after communization, commodity exchange has shrunk, currency will soon be unnecessary, and the bank has nothing to do, etc.), continue to carry forward the enthusiasm and creativity of all bank cadres, and closely combine the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act with the style of seeking truth from facts.

    人民银行分行行长会议讨论新形势新任务
    信贷工作为人民公社服务
    据新华社17日讯  中国人民银行总行于11月20日至12月11日在武汉召开了全国分行行长会议，着重讨论了在当前人民公社化的新形势下，银行信贷结算工作如何为巩固人民公社和发展公社生产服务的问题，还讨论了国营企业流动资金管理问题，实行新的信贷管理体制和1959年国家信贷计划问题。
    会议结束前，李先念副总理在会上讲了话。
    会议初步总结了1958年银行工作的成绩和经验。首先，今年人民储蓄存款增加数预计将比1957年增加数多一倍，同时吸收人民公社存款预计将达几十亿元，这不仅壮大了国家信贷资金力量，而且对于巩固人民公社和准备明年生产资金具有重要作用。其次，银行发放各种贷款，及时满足了工农业生产大跃进和商业扩大经营中对流动资金的需要，今年银行增加的放款，相当于第一个五年计划期间增加的总数。再次，改革了规章制度，便利了企业，便利了群众。
    会议认为，这些成就的取得，主要是由于党的领导和银行干部在业务工作中做到了政治挂帅和坚持群众路线。
    会议认为，在人民公社化以后，银行和公社信用部的工作任务加重了。现在由于农村财贸机构下放，国家下放给公社管理使用的流动资金即达一百亿元左右。怎样合理使用这些流动资金，以支持公社工农业并举，帮助公社所属企业建立经济核算，就是银行和公社信用部的主要任务。会议指出在今冬明春，银行干部应该积极参加到生产和整社运动中去，并抓紧在当前市场旺季中，努力收回到期农贷、吸收存款、收回预购定金，为明年的大生产准备资金；同时努力健全公社信用部机构，帮助公社所属单位建立和健全财务和信贷管理制度，使信贷成为巩固和提高人民公社的一个有力工具。为了发挥公社管理流动资金和发掘资金潜力的积极性，会议确定对公社信贷管理上实行差额包干的办法，即经过估算结果，如果公社预计存款大于预算贷款，多余部分资金作为向银行存款；预计贷款大于预计存款，不足部分由银行贷款解决。在差额包干的范围内，如果存款增加得多或贷款收回得多，就可以多发放贷款。
    会议提出，从1959年1月1日起，国营企业和公私合营企业所需要的流动资金，全部改由银行贷款解决，即是将过去由财政机关直接拨给的定额流动资金，也转由银行用贷款的形式解决。这个办法已报请国务院审批下达。
    为了适应工业、商业、财政体制下放的情况，会议研究了1959年实行新的信贷管理体制的具体问题。会议指出，在信贷管理体制下放后，地方信贷资金的基本原则应当是：眼睛向下，自力更生。地方信贷超过原定计划，需要增加贷款的时候，资金的来源，主要是靠组织各项存款和地方财政增拨信贷资金，不足时再由中央补助一部分。
    会议认为，为了做好银行工作，更好地为党的中心任务服务，必须坚持政治挂帅，提高干部的共产主义觉悟，澄清某些糊涂思想（如认为公社化后，商品交换缩小了，货币很快就不需要了，银行没事做了等），继续发扬全行干部的积极性和创造性，并且使敢想敢说敢做的精神同实事求是的作风密切结合起来。
