    Ten Thousand Bright Pearls Illuminate Xingtai
    Qing Tian
    Since the key completion of the Louxiacun small-scale hydroelectric power station in Xingtai County, Hebei Province on May 1, 1957, the county has closely integrated with various central movements, actively seized the training of key personnel during station construction, and launched a mass movement for the whole people to run electricity, achieving great results. As of mid-October 1958, the county had built 25 hydroelectric power stations, 13 thermal power stations, and 2 biogas power stations, with a total installed capacity of 353 kilowatts, supplying electricity for processing and lighting to 66 villages, 15 factories, and more than 11,000 households. It also built 54 hydroelectric power stations, directly processing and milling flour, and can generate electricity by installing generators.
    During this year's mass steelmaking campaign, electricity also played a close supporting role. All six key iron and steel bases in the county were equipped with electrical equipment. In the iron and steel bases alone, more than 3,000 electric lights were installed to ensure nighttime lighting. The commune members sang while working: "The radio keeps singing, the electric lights keep shining, we can work day and night, our hearts are bright, our hearts are bright, our strength is strong, and the steel marshal will be promoted early." The Dongwang Iron and Steel Plant used electric blowers in steelmaking. The construction of the county's 6.5 cubic meter small blast furnaces mostly used electric welding. Electricity was also installed in several coal mines and mine shafts. This played a significant role in promoting day and night construction and ensuring the supply of fuel and raw materials for steelmaking and ironmaking.
    In addition, the county's electricity has greatly promoted the development of the machinery industry. The six-foot lathe in the Dongwang Machinery Factory originally required eight people to operate and was very inefficient. After using electricity, only a 2.4-kilowatt motor was needed, which not only replaced heavy manual labor but also increased efficiency by more than two times.
    Plant the Wutong Tree, the Phoenix Will Come
    The local people have a great interest in developing electricity. When the first hydroelectric power station, the Louxiacun Hydroelectric Power Station, was completed and generated electricity in May last year, the farmers composed many rhymes to sing the beginning of a new life. One of them is:
  "The sun sets and the moon rises, thousands of stars fall from the sky, the stars fall in Louxiacun, men, women, old and young are smiling, a hydroelectric power station is built in the village, and every commune member's household has lights installed, electricity drives the small steel mill, milling flour is faster and more labor-saving, this is the first time since ancient times, thanks to the leader Mao Zedong." At present, rural electricity is mostly used for pumping water for irrigation, milling flour, pressing oil, chopping grass, ginning cotton, and various industrial and agricultural sideline processing and production. At the same time, open broadcasts of records and screenings of movies activate the cultural life of commune members and workers. Jiangshui Town in the deep mountains has set up a relay station, and commune members living in the deep mountain valleys can hear the radio from the county town every day.
    The development of small-scale electricity has also promoted the rapid development of rural handicrafts towards a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, semi-mechanization, and mechanization, and promoted the relatively concentrated construction of various industrial and agricultural sideline processing around the power stations. Beizhang Village established a 96-kilowatt hydroelectric power station (currently with an installed capacity of 48 kilowatts). Around this power station, in addition to installing 2,600 electric lights, it also established a cotton ginning factory, which has installed ten roller gins and two saw gins, all powered by electricity, ginning 30,000 to 50,000 catties of seed cotton per day, becoming a cotton distribution center for many nearby villages. Now, the People's Commune is preparing to arrange various industrial and agricultural sideline processing around this power station. The masses said, "Plant the Wutong tree, the phoenix will come," and this is absolutely true.
    Break Through Technical Barriers, Strange Flowers Bloom
    When Xingtai County began to build a hydroelectric power station in Louxiacun, there was only one transferred soldier, He Yunfu, who had worked in telecommunications in the army, but had never worked in hydroelectric power generation. However, with the support and encouragement of the Party, and after hard work, he finally found a way in motor manufacturing. At the same time, 29 young commune members became electrical installation workers. Later, the county party committee held training classes in Beizhang Village and Beidaguocun, adopting the method of building while training, and trained 320 technicians in two sessions. In this way, a batch of stations was built, and a batch of technical cadres was produced. Now, the county has more than 500 electrical technicians, strengthening the technical force of electrification. Xingtai County particularly emphasized learning from brother counties. In order to learn from the experience of biogas power generation, the county party committee sent ministers and section chiefs to Hubei to study, and to learn the skills of simple power stations, they went north to Jinghai to learn. After returning from the studies, they immediately built pilot projects. With the active support of cadres and the masses, the biogas flower transplanted from Hubei has blossomed and borne fruit throughout the county. After learning from Jinghai, they absorbed their experience in modifying motors with capacitors and modified 19 generators, building 19 miniature power stations in Xiaoshan Village. Vigorously learning from the experience of other places and valuing the people's creativity can break through all difficulties and gain certain innovations in technology. They adopted the Soviet "two-line one-ground system" experience from books, and the effect was good, saving a large amount of wire. In terms of load power, they tested a 20-kilowatt generator starting a 15-horsepower motor without starting equipment, and the effect was also very good, and the load capacity reached more than 80% of the power generation. Now, all power stations below 500 kilowatts can be designed and constructed by themselves.
    Boldly Create and Mass Produce
    After initially solving the technical problems, the most important difficulty was the lack of various materials for manufacturing motors. In the past, because they had not shaken off the "reaching out" and "waiting" mentality, they suffered a lot, either "running all over the world and finding nowhere" or "getting them but not cooperating with each other," delaying things and wasting people's time. This time, the county party committee decided to rely on its own efforts and transform the Dongwang Iron Industry Production Cooperative into a factory specializing in the production of motors. From then on, they relied on the several blacksmith furnaces in the People's Commune to manufacture motors without a single machine tool. After several failures, they finally overcame the difficulties and produced the first 1.5-kilowatt generator.
    Currently, they have produced three 1.5-kilowatt generators and have begun to make 4.5-kilowatt generators.
    While manufacturing generators, they also learned to design their own distribution panels, using wood instead of iron frames, saving 1,800 yuan per frame. High-voltage transmission transformers were difficult to buy, so they started buying materials and assembling them themselves. Other equipment such as water turbines, hoists, iron splints, stirrups, and Bunsen burners used in power stations were all manufactured by themselves. Now, they have made 30 distribution panels and 15 sets of generator parts. They are also preparing to draw their own copper wire and plan to try various indigenous methods to replace silicon steel sheets in order to meet the needs of complete self-made motors.
    How can Xingtai County develop the power industry at such a high speed? Their preliminary experience is: fully relying on and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; strengthening leadership and adhering to the principle of people-run and people-managed. It can be done in one place and succeed in one place, without producing waste products; and it can also not carry burdens, free hands and feet, and move forward in big strides. (Attached picture)

    万颗明珠照邢台
    晴天
    河北省邢台县自从1957年5月1日重点建成楼下村小型水力发电站以后，密切结合了各项中心运动，积极抓紧在建站中培训了骨干，深入开展了全民办电的群众运动，收到很大的效果。截至1958年10月中旬止，全县建成水力电站二十五座，火力电站十三座，沼气发电站二座，总共装机容量三百五十三瓩，供给六十六个村、十五个工厂、一万一千多户加工照明用电；并建成水力动力站五十四座，直接进行加工、磨面，安上发电机即可发电。
    今年全民大炼钢铁运动中，电力亦作到了密切配合。全县六个重点钢铁基地，都安装了电气设备，仅在钢铁基地上，就安装了三千余盏电灯，保证了钢铁基地夜战照明。社员们一边干活一边唱：“广播一直唱、电灯来照亮，昼夜能干活，心里多亮堂，心里亮，力量强，钢铁元帅早升帐”，东汪钢铁厂炼钢中利用了电力鼓风。该县六点五立方公尺的小高炉的基建，大都利用电焊。在几个煤窑和矿井中，也安装了电力。这对昼夜施工、保证炼钢炼铁的燃料原料供应起了很大的促进作用。
    另外，这个县的电力对于促进机械工业的发展也有很大作用。东汪机械厂六呎车床原来需要八个人搅动，而且效率很低，使用电力后，只需二点四瓩电动机，不但代替了繁重的体力劳动，而且提高效率达两倍以上。
    栽上梧桐树，凤凰自飞来
    当地人民对发展电力有着极大的兴趣。去年5月当第一个水电站——楼下村水电站建成发电时起，农民们编了很多顺口溜来歌唱又一次新生活的开端。其中一首是：
  “太阳落山月亮升，天上掉下千颗星，明星掉在楼下村，男女老少笑盈盈，村里建起水电站，社员户户安上灯，电力带动小钢磨，磨面又快又省工，自古以来头一次，感谢领袖毛泽东”。目前，农村电力大部分用作抽水浇地、磨面、榨油、铡草、轧花及各种工业及农副业加工生产。同时，开放广播唱片、放映电影，活跃社员和工人们的文化生活。深山区的浆水镇设立了转播站，居住在深山沟里的社员每天都可以听到县城里的广播。
    小型电力的发展，也促进农村手工业很快向土洋结合、向半机械、机械化方面发展，促进了各种工业、农副业加工围绕电站进行比较集中的建设。北张村建立了一个九十六瓩的水电站（目前装机为四十八瓩），围绕这个电站，除安装电灯二千六百个以外，还建立了一个轧花厂，已装皮辊轧机十台，锯齿轧机二台，均用电力拖动，日轧籽棉三至五万斤，成了附近很多村棉花集散中心。现在，人民公社准备围绕这个电站，安排各种工业及农副业加工。群众说：“栽上梧桐树，凤凰自飞来”，这话是一点也不错的。
    冲破技术关，奇花放异彩
    邢台县开始在楼下村建立水电站时，只有一个转业军人贺允复在部队里搞过电讯工作，但没搞过水力发电，但在党的支持和鼓励下，经过刻苦钻研，终于在电机制造上摸出了头绪。同时还有二十九名青年社员变成了电气安装工人。后来县委在北张村、北大郭村召开训练 班，采用边建边训的方法，两次又培养出技术人员三百二十名，就这样建一批站产生一批技术干部，现在全县已有电气技术人员五百余名，壮大了电气化的技术力量。邢台县特别强调向兄弟县学习，邢台县为学习沼气发电的经验，县委曾选派部长、科长南到湖北学习，为学习简易发电站的本领又北到静海取经。学习回来就立即建点实验。在干部和广大群众积极支持下，从湖北移植来的沼气之花，已在全县开花结果。从静海学习回来，吸取了他们用电容器改装电动机的经验，改装了十九部发电机，分别在小山庄建成十九座袖珍发电站。虚心学习外地经验，和重视人民创造，就可以冲破一切难关，并在技术方面获得了一定的创造。他们从书本上采用苏联的“两线一地制”经验，效果良好，节约了大批的电线。载动动力上试办二十瓩发电量启动十五马力电动机，不用启动设备，效果也很好，载动量达到发电量的80％以上。现在五百瓩以下的电站已经全部能由自己设计施工。
    大胆创造大量制造
    在初步解决了技术问题以后，一个最主要的困难是缺乏制造电机的各种器材。过去由于未摆脱“伸手”“等待”思想，吃尽了苦头，不是“跑遍天下无处找”，便是“得来相互不配合”，误事旷人。这次，县委决心自力更生，并把东汪铁业生产社转化为专门生产电机的工厂。从此，他们就依靠人民公社中的几盘铁匠炉，在没有一台机床的条件下，制造起电机来了。经过几次失败后，终于战胜了困难，制成了第一台一点五瓩的发电机。
    目前，他们已制成一点五瓩的发电机三台，并开始做四点五瓩的发电机。
    在制造发电机的同时，并学会自己设计配电盘，用木料代替铁架子，使每架节约资金一千八百元。高压输电变压器，很难买到，就动手自己买料装配。其他如电站用的水轮机、起闭机以及铁夹板、脚扣、本生灯等都由自己制造。现在，他们已作了三十个配电盘，十五套发电机械零件。他们还准备自己拔铜线，并拟试用各种土办法代替矽钢片，以满足全部自造电机的需要。
    邢台县凭什么能高速度的发展电力工业呢？他们的初步体会是：充分依靠和发挥了群众的积极性、创造性；加强领导，坚持民办民营的方针。既作到了做一处成一处，不出废品；又可以不背包袱，甩开手脚，大踏步前进。（附图片）
