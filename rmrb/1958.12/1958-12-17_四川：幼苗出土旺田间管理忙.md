Sichuan: Seedlings Emerge Vigorously, Field Management Keeps Busy

    According to the Sichuan Daily News, autumn planting in various parts of Sichuan is nearing completion. 60% to 70% of the planted minor autumn crops have emerged, and the seedlings are generally growing well. Most areas have now moved into field management. Nanchong Prefecture and some counties in other prefectures have convened on-site field management meetings. Most communes have established field management committees or headquarters to instill high-yield thinking in the masses. Around 30% of the labor force has been organized into specialized teams to promote a system of contracted responsibility by area, implementing measures in the fields, and managing quotas. Specific requirements have also been put forward for technical measures in field management. For example, Nanchong Prefecture, led by twelve key communes, initiated a "Seven No's" competition (i.e., no missing plants, no missing seedlings, no weeds, no waterlogging, no pests and diseases, no yellow seedlings, and no excessive growth and lodging). Wheat topdressing in the area has reached 60% to 70%, and rapeseed has been topdressed twice in 60% of the fields. Neijiang Prefecture has organized a professional team of more than 750,000 people to manage high-yield fields.

    Through field management, progress has been made in eliminating third-class seedlings, applying topdressing, weeding and loosening the soil, controlling pests, and draining water in various regions. In Da County, 85% of third-class seedlings have been eliminated. In Jingyan County, 45% of second-class seedlings have been upgraded to first-class seedlings, and 75% of third-class seedlings have been eliminated. In Wenjiang Prefecture, 62% of wheat has been topdressed, and 25% of rapeseed has been topdressed. In Mianyang Prefecture, 12.8% of rapeseed has been topdressed twice, replanting has been carried out on 33% of the area that needs replanting, and pest and disease control has been carried out on 78.58% of the area that needs it.

    However, judging from the reports from various regions, problems still exist with first, second, and third-class seedlings. According to an investigation and analysis by the Da County Prefectural Committee, most of the first-class seedlings are in "satellite" fields, some of which have excessive seed use, and the land utilization rate is only 50%, resulting in excessive density, yellowing, or lodging. Naxi County also reported that some excessively dense seedlings are rotting and dying. Among the second-class seedlings in some areas, some are experiencing uneven growth, with some areas green and some yellow, due to uneven base fertilizer application, coarse soil preparation, turning up old soil during deep plowing, or unfermented fertilizer. The poorly growing third-class seedlings distributed in some areas are mostly due to poor drainage, and a few are due to insufficient fertilization or pest and disease damage. Various regions are taking different measures according to specific situations to manage these abnormally growing wheat fields.

### 四川：幼苗出土旺田间管理忙

    四川：幼苗出土旺田间管理忙
    据四川日报消息  目前，四川各地秋种工作将近结束，播种的小春作物有60％—70％已出土，一般幼苗生长不错，大部地区现已转入田间管理。南充专区和其他专区部分县已召开了田间管理现场会议。大部分公社建立了田间管理委员会或指挥部，在群众中树立高产思想，以30％左右的劳力组织专业队，推行划片包干、措施到田、定额管理责任制。对田间管理的技术措施也大部分提出了具体要求。如南充专区以十二个重点社发起了七无竞赛运动（即无缺窝、无缺苗、无草、无涝、无病虫、无黄苗、无徒长倒伏等），该区小麦追肥已达60％到70％，油菜有60％追肥两次。内江专区组织了七十五万多人的专业队管理高产田。
    各地通过田间管理，在消灭三类苗追肥、中耕除草、治虫、排水等方面都取得了一定成绩。达县三类苗已消灭85％，井研县已有45％的二类苗提高为一类苗，消灭三类苗达75％。温江专区小麦已追肥62％，油菜已追肥25％。绵阳专区有12.8％的油菜追了二次肥，已补苗占应补面积的33％，防治病虫占应防治面积的78.58％。
    但从各地反映来看，不论一、二、三类苗都还存在一些问题。据达县地委调查分析，一类苗大部是“卫星”田，其中有部分用种过多，而土地利用率只有50％，因而显得过密，发生返黄或起旋窝倒伏现象。纳溪县也反映有些过密的苗子腐烂死掉。一些地区的二类苗当中，有的因基肥不匀，泥巴不细，深耕时翻出了老底子，或肥料未腐熟等，有一块青、一块黄、生长不匀的现象。分布在一些地区的生长不好的三类苗大部是排水不良，少数是施肥不足，有病、虫为害。各地正在针对具体情况，采取不同措施，加工管理这些生长不正常的麦田。
