Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: The U.S. authorities are extremely unwilling to accept the severe blow they suffered from the victory of the Iraqi revolution and are currently brewing new conspiracies to subvert and strangle this republic. These conspiracies can already be seen from the many reports in American newspapers and news agencies in recent times, especially around the time of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree's visit to the Middle East.

Some American newspapers are already unreservedly advocating military intervention in Iraq. The "Christian Science Monitor" published a report on December 11th by its Mediterranean correspondent, Ellis, saying that the situation in Iraq has "threatened" Western oil interests. He implied that "events in Baghdad may soon force the United States to make a fundamental decision in the Middle East, possibly as serious as the decision needed to send American troops to Lebanon this summer." Ellis also said that Iraq's neighbors, Iran and Turkey, are already feeling "anxious," and he particularly stated that Turkey would not fail to "try to reverse (the Iraqi) situation—using force if necessary."

Ellis's argument is consistent with the remarks of some other American newspapers. For example, "Business Week" once emphasized that in order to deal with Iraq, "the U.S. State Department is strengthening 'military guarantees' to Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan."

While advocating military intervention, American propaganda organs are also adopting the old methods of division, spreading suspicion and jealousy, and creating discord, vigorously provoking disunity within Iraq and between it and other Arab countries. The American "Business Week" even openly advocated "launching a military coup in Iraq" on November 15th. In order to attack Iraq's patriotic and democratic forces, some other newspapers are particularly enthusiastic about slandering the Iraqi people's revolution as "threatening" "Arab nationalism" in order to sow discord among Arab countries. Alsop advocated in the "New York Herald Tribune" that the United States should "strive to establish new relations between Arab countries and between Arab countries and the West."

The point mentioned by Alsop about establishing "new relations" is precisely the issue that many other American newspapers are hotly discussing. It can be seen from these remarks that while preparing to directly intervene in Iraq, the United States will focus on creating division and confrontation within Arab countries in order to "isolate" and attack Iraq, hinder the development of the Middle Eastern people's independent struggle, and ultimately achieve the goal of defeating them one by one.

### 美国宣传机关纷纷透露  美国正双管齐下反对伊拉克

    美国宣传机关纷纷透露
    美国正双管齐下反对伊拉克
    一面策动伊朗土耳其准备进行军事干涉
    一面挑拨伊拉克和其它阿拉伯国家关系
    新华社25日讯  美国当局对于伊拉克革命胜利使它遭到的严重打击极不甘心，目前正在酝酿颠复和扼杀这个共和国的新阴谋。这一阴谋从最近时期，特别是美国助理国务卿朗特里访问中东前后美国报刊通讯社的许多报道中，已经可以看出眉目。
    一些美国报刊已经毫不隐讳地在鼓吹对伊拉克进行军事干涉。“基督教科学箴言报”12月11日发表它驻地中海记者艾利斯的报道说，伊拉克局势已经使西方的石油利益“受到威胁”。他暗示，“巴格达的事态可能在不久以后促使美国必须在中东作出一个根本性的决定，可能同今年夏天派美国军队去黎巴嫩的时候所需要作的决定一样严重。”艾利斯还说，伊拉克的近邻伊朗和土耳其已经感到“焦虑”，他特别表示，土耳其将不会不“设法扭转（伊拉克）局势——必要时使用武力”。
    艾利斯的这种论调同美国其他一些报刊的言论是吻合的，例如，“商业周刊”曾经强调指出，为了对付伊拉克，“美国国务院正在向土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦加强‘军事保证’”。
    在鼓吹军事干涉同时，美国宣传机关也在采取分化、散播怀疑猜忌、制造不和的老手法，大肆挑拨伊拉克内部和它同其他阿拉伯国家的团结。11月15日的美国“商业周刊”甚至公开鼓吹“在伊拉克发动军事政变”。为了要打击伊拉克的爱国民主力量，另外有些报刊特别热中于诬蔑伊拉克人民革命“威胁”了“阿拉伯民族主义”，以便在阿拉伯国家之间散布不和。艾尔索普就在“纽约先驱论坛报”上鼓吹美国应当“努力建立阿拉伯国家之间以及阿拉伯国家和西方的新关系。”
    艾尔索普谈到的关于建立“新关系”的这一点也正是美国其他许多报刊正在热烈谈论的问题。从这些言论中可以看出，美国在准备直接干涉伊拉克的同时，将着重在阿拉伯国家内部制造分裂和对立，以便“孤立”和打击伊拉克、阻挠中东人民独立斗争的发展，最后达到各个击破的目的。
