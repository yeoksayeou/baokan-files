Where the Railway Passes, Education Follows
    Jilin Railway Bureau Widely Organizes Workers' Study at Every Station and Section

    (Our dispatch) Jilin Railway Bureau, in light of the complex nature of railway production, dispersed work locations, and high employee turnover, has adopted various forms of learning to widely organize employees to participate in study.

    The railway lines under the Jilin Railway Bureau are mainly distributed in the Changbai Mountain area. The lines are long, with many railway branches extending into the deep mountains and dense forests, making them remote. In response to this situation, the Railway Bureau has vigorously developed part-work, part-study schools and amateur Red and Expert schools. Employees of larger stations, sections, affiliated factories, some smaller units, and many office cadres have been organized into these schools for learning. However, many employees are still unable to persist in their studies due to the special nature of their production, dispersion, and mobility. For example, small stations along the railway line, construction site workers, and train crews, sometimes numbering twenty or thirty, and sometimes only ten, are often unable to study effectively throughout the year. Many leading cadres who were promoted from among the workers in the past are also unable to persist in learning due to frequent business trips, meetings, and temporary assignments.

    In light of these circumstances, the Jilin Railway Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to establish schools at every station and section, mobilizing the masses to adopt diverse forms of learning and jointly find solutions to the problems existing in learning.

    Currently, in addition to organizing a large number of employees to participate in part-work, part-study schools and amateur Red and Expert schools, several larger areas have also established leadership cadre training courses, correspondence courses, self-study groups, winter training courses, on-site training courses, and short-term employee training courses, organizing employees to enroll in schools from various aspects. Many cadres working in remote areas along the railway line can participate in short-term training courses on a rotational basis for systematic learning. Cadres with a cultural level equivalent to or higher than elementary school graduation can improve to the junior high school graduation level after several short-term training sessions. Employees and train crews along the railway line are gradually participating in a new type of correspondence course. This type of correspondence course combines correspondence and face-to-face instruction. Teachers compile their own teaching materials based on the cultural level of the employees and distribute them for self-study; at the same time, they divide up the responsibilities and regularly go to the stations and sections along the line to conduct face-to-face instruction and tutoring. For employees with greater seasonality and mobility, such as track maintenance workers and communication workers, they are organized to participate in full-time study in winter training courses for about two months during the slack winter season. Employees who are too dispersed and have a higher level of education adopt self-study and regular tutoring methods to enable them to persist in learning. In order to improve the technical level of workers, on-site technical training courses are also organized irregularly according to production needs to learn advanced technologies and exchange experiences. Short-term employee training courses are also attached to secondary vocational schools to draw technical personnel for rotational training to systematically improve their cultural, technical, and political levels.

    These learning forms are complementary and closely linked. Employees can choose the learning form that best suits them based on their work characteristics and specific circumstances; at the same time, when one learning form is temporarily unavailable (such as when seasonal training courses have not started or rotational training courses have not yet been reached), they can also participate in other forms of learning so that learning is not interrupted. The diverse forms of learning have created good conditions for employee learning, and participation in learning is very common. For example, in the Jiaohe area under the Jilin Railway Bureau, more than 94% of employees have now been organized to participate in various school studies, basically achieving universal schooling from cadres to workers and even odd-job personnel.

    Currently, the study of the broad masses of employees of the Jilin Railway Bureau has achieved great results. The leadership cadre training courses run in the Jilin area have already had two classes graduate successively. After more than a month of intensive study, the students have all reached the junior high school graduation level and have been promoted to the high school classes of the amateur school to continue their studies. Zhang Jingchun, deputy section chief of the Jilin Locomotive Depot, who has more than 30 years of work experience, has been able to apply the physics and algebra calculation methods he has learned to his work. While studying high school courses, he has begun to study internal combustion locomotives based on his rich experience. Among the 672 employees in the six units in the Meihekou area who participated in learning after becoming literate, 621 people put forward 5,715 innovation suggestions. Zhang Shukuai, foreman of the bridge engineering team, studied and improved the construction method of "renovating cracked open channels with major repair cycles," which can save the country more than 10,000 yuan in funds throughout the year. Guo Yubao, a track maintenance worker, developed the "ground-use bellows," which solved the difficulty of each work area building small red stoves without bellows. Many workers have participated in various management tasks and are able to write simple plans and reports.

    铁路通过那里  教育办到那里
    吉林铁路局站站段段办学校广泛组织职工学习
    本报讯  吉林铁路局针对铁路的生产性质复杂，工作地点分散，职工流动性大等特点，采取多种多样的学习形式，广泛组织职工参加学习。
    吉林铁路局所属各铁路线，主要分布在长白山地区，线路长，很多铁路支线伸入深山密林，地处偏僻。铁路局根据这种情况，大力发展了半工半读学校和业余红专学校。较大的站、段、附属工厂和一些较小单位的职工和许多机关干部，都已组织在这些学校中进行学习。但是，仍然有很多职工，由于生产性质特殊，分散，流动等原因，无法坚持学习。如铁路沿线的小车站、工地的职工和乘务人员等，多的二、三十人，少的不过十人，常年不能很好学习。很多过去由工人中提拔起来的领导干部，他们由于出差多，会议多，临时任务多，也不能坚持学习。
    根据这些情况，中共吉林铁路局委员会提出站站段段办学校的号召，发动群众采取多种多样的学习形式，共同设法解决学习中存在的问题。
    现在，几个较大地区除了大量组织职工参加半工半读学校和业余红专学校的学习外，又创办了领导干部轮训班、函授班、自学班、冬季训练班、现场训练班、职工短期轮训班等学习形式，从各方面组织职工入学。在铁路沿线偏僻地区工作的许多干部，可以轮流参加短期训练班系统地进行学习。一般具有小学毕业以上文化水平的干部，经过几次短期轮训，就能提高到初中毕业的水平。铁路沿线的职工和乘务人员等正陆续参加新型的函授班学习。这种函授班是函授和面授相结合的。教师根据职工的文化程度自编教材，分发给职工自学；同时，他们又分片包干，定期到沿线各站、段进行面授和辅导。对季节性、流动性较大的职工，如养路工、通讯工等，则利用冬闲季节两个月左右的时间，组织在冬季训练班进行脱产学习。一些过于分散、文化程度较高的职工，采取自学和定期辅导的办法，使他们也能够坚持学习。为了提高工人的技术水平，根据生产需要，还不定期地组织现场技术训练班，学习先进技术，交流经验。在中等专业学校里还附设了职工短期轮训班，抽调技术人员进行轮训，系统地提高他们的文化、技术和政治水平。
    这些学习形式是相辅相成，密切联系的，职工们可以根据他们的工作特点和具体情况，选择他们最适合的学习形式进行学习；同时，当一种学习形式暂时不能进行时
  （如季节性训练班未开始或轮训班未轮到），还可以参加别种形式的学习，使学习不致间断。多种多样的学习形式，为职工学习创造了良好条件，参加学习的十分普遍。如吉林铁路局所属蛟河地区，现在已组织了94％以上的职工参加各种学校学习，基本作到从干部到工人以至勤杂人员人人上学。
    现在，吉林铁路局广大职工的学习收到了很大成效。吉林地区所办的领导干部轮训班已有两个班相继结业。学员们经过一个多月的集中学习，都达到了初中毕业水平，已升入业余学校的高中班继续学习。具有三十多年工龄的吉林机务段副段长张景春，已经能够把学到的物理、代数计算方法，运用到业务中去。他一面学习高中课程，一面结合他的丰富经验开始研究内燃机车。在梅河口地区的六个单位，脱盲后参加学习的六百七十二名职工中，有六百二十一人提出了五千七百一十五件革新建议。桥梁工长张书魁研究改进了“整修破裂明渠大修周期”施工方法，全年可给国家节省资金一万多元。养路工郭玉宝研究出“地用风匣”，解决了各工区修建小红炉没有风箱的困难。很多工人参加了各种管理工作，而且能够写简单的计划和报告。
