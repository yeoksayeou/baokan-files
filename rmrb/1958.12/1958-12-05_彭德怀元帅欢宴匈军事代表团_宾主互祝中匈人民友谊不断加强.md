Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, Marshal Peng Dehuai, hosted a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the entire Hungarian military delegation led by General Révész.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said at the banquet: The Hungarian People's Army has a glorious history of fighting against fascism. Especially after the establishment of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, it learned from the lessons of the "October Events" and strengthened the Party's leadership over the army, as well as political and military training. We are very pleased to see that the Hungarian People's Army has become a people's army with modern military technology and a high degree of political awareness, and it is more pure, stronger, and more powerful than before. We firmly believe that this people's army, loyal to Marxism-Leninism, is a powerful armed force to defend Hungary's socialist system, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defend peace in Europe and the world, and is our close and reliable comrade-in-arms.

Marshal Peng Dehuai pointed out that when domestic counter-revolutionary elements colluded with foreign imperialism to create a counter-revolutionary riot in October 1956, the Hungarian working people, under the strong leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Comrade Kádár, with the help of the great Soviet Union, and with the support of the parties and peoples of the socialist camp, quickly crushed the rampant offensive of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary elements, gave a devastating blow to the traitors of Marxism-Leninism and counter-revolutionary rioters, and saved the revolutionary achievements of the Hungarian people. This is not only a major victory for the Hungarian people, but also a major victory for the entire socialist camp and the world communist movement. He also congratulated the Hungarian people on the great victories they have achieved in the cause of socialist construction.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said: There is a deep internationalist friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples. Our two countries have always had completely consistent views on major international issues. Our people are deeply grateful to the Hungarian government for its just statement on the situation in the Taiwan area on September 12 this year. U.S. imperialism's blatant occupation of our territory Taiwan, like the U.S. imperialism's plot to subvert Hungary, is bound to fail.

Marshal Peng Dehuai concluded by saying: We sincerely hope that during your visit to our country, you will exchange experiences as much as possible, and in particular, offer opinions on the shortcomings in our work.

Hungarian People's Republic Minister of Defense and head of the military delegation, General Révész, spoke amidst warm applause. He said, the comradely love we have felt in your capital, we consider to be the trust shown to our dear motherland, to our hard-working people and army.

General Révész said that one of the biggest lessons we learned from the October counter-revolutionary event is to maintain the unity of the socialist camp and protect our unity as we protect the apple of our eye. The rock-solid unity of our great and invincible socialist camp is the guarantee of peace for the people of all countries. Precisely because of this, our common enemy is trying everything possible to undermine this unity. This is what imperialism showed during its attack on Hungary in 1956 and what the revisionists have shown since then. However, the unity of the proletariat, built on the foundation of the truth of Marxism-Leninism, has gloriously stood the test, and our camp is more united than ever before. Please allow me, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of our army, to express our gratitude for the great political, moral, and material assistance you have given us.

General Révész concluded by saying that our military delegation will tirelessly use all its time to understand your army and the work of your people, and through meetings and exchanges of experience, to deepen our proletarian internationalist unity and the friendship between our two peoples.

Attending tonight's banquet were Senior General Huang Kecheng, Senior General Gan Siqi, Senior General Peng Shaohui, Senior General Chen Bojun, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Tang Tianji, Lieutenant General Li Zuopeng, Air Force Lieutenant General Wu Faxian, Navy Lieutenant General Luo Shunchu, Air Force Lieutenant General Cao Lihuai, Lieutenant General Liu Zhong, Lieutenant General Mo Wenhua, Lieutenant General Yuan Ziqin, Lieutenant General Kong Shiquan, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Also attending the banquet was Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua.

Second Secretary of the Hungarian Embassy in China, Mr. Gaonde, and military attachés of various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    彭德怀元帅欢宴匈军事代表团
    宾主互祝中匈人民友谊不断加强
    新华社4日讯  国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅，今天晚上举行宴会，热烈欢迎以雷维斯上将为首的匈牙利军事代表团全体贵宾。
  彭德怀元帅在宴会上讲话说：匈牙利人民军曾经有过光荣的反法西斯的战斗历史，尤其是在匈牙利工农革命政府成立后，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，吸取了“十月事件”的教训，加强了党对军队的领导，以及政治、军事训练工作。我们很高兴地看到，匈牙利人民军已经成为一支具有现代军事技术和高度政治觉悟的人民军队，比以前更加纯洁、更加坚强和壮大了。我们深信，这支忠于马克思列宁主义的人民军队，是保卫匈牙利的社会主义制度，巩固无产阶级专政，保卫欧洲和世界和平的一支强大的武装力量，是我们亲密可靠的战友。
    彭德怀元帅指出，当1956年10月国内反革命分子勾结外国帝国主义制造反革命暴乱事件的时候，匈牙利劳动人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党和卡达尔同志的坚强领导下，在伟大苏联的帮助下，在社会主义阵营各国的党和人民的支援下，迅速地粉碎了国内外反革命分子的猖狂进攻，给马列主义的叛徒、反革命暴乱分子以毁灭性的打击，挽救了匈牙利人民的革命果实。这不仅是匈牙利人民的重大胜利，同时也是整个社会主义阵营和世界共产主义运动的一个重大胜利。他并且祝贺匈牙利人民在社会主义建设事业中所取得的巨大胜利。
    彭德怀元帅说：中匈两国人民存在着深厚的国际主义的友谊，对于重大的国际问题，我们两国一向有着完全一致的看法。我国人民深深感谢匈牙利政府今年9月12日关于台湾地区局势问题的正义声明。美帝国主义横蛮地霸占我国的领土台湾，同美帝国主义曾经阴谋颠复匈牙利一样，是一定要失败的。
    彭德怀元帅最后说：我们衷心希望你们在我国参观访问期间，多多地交换双方的经验，特别是对我们工作中的缺点，提出意见。
    匈牙利人民共和国国防部长、军事代表团团长雷维斯上将在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，我们在你们的首都所感受到的同志的热爱，我们认为是对我们亲爱的祖国、对我国勤劳的人民和军队所表现的信任。
    雷维斯上将说，从十月反革命事件中，我们吸取的最大的经验之一就是要维护社会主义阵营的团结，保护我们的团结，就像保护我们的眼珠一样。我们伟大的不可战胜的社会主义阵营坚如磐石的团结，是世界各国人民和平的保证。正因为如此，我们共同的敌人想尽一切办法来破坏这种团结。帝国主义在1956年对匈牙利的进攻时期和从那时以后修正主义者们所表现的就是这样。但是，建筑在马克思、列宁主义真理的基础上的无产阶级的团结，光辉地经住了考验，我们的阵营比从前更加团结了。请允许我代表我们军队的全体官兵对你们在政治上、道义上和物质上所给予我们的巨大帮助，表示感谢。
    雷维斯上将最后说，我们军事代表团将不倦地利用所有的时间来了解你们的军队和你们人民的工作，通过会见、交流经验，来加深我们无产阶级国际主义团结和两国人民的友谊。
    出席今晚宴会的有黄克诚大将、甘泗淇上将、彭绍辉上将、陈伯钧上将、萧向荣中将、唐天际中将、李作鹏中将、吴法宪空军中将、罗舜初海军中将、曹里怀空军中将、刘忠中将、莫文骅中将、袁子钦中将、孔石泉中将等中国人民解放军高级将领。
    出席宴会的还有外交部部长助理乔冠华。
    匈牙利驻中国大使馆二等秘书高恩德和各国驻华武官，也应邀出席了宴会。
