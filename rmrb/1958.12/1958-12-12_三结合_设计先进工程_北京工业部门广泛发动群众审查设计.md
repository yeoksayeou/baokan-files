    "Three-Combination" Design Advances Engineering
    Beijing Industrial Departments Widely Mobilize the Masses to Review Designs

    (Our dispatch) Beijing industrial departments mobilized the broad masses to review seventy-six industrial designs that were under construction or had not yet begun, making these designs more abundant, faster, better, and more economical.

    This mass design review movement was conducted under the direct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Starting in late October, the city established nine leading groups according to industries such as metallurgy, machinery and electronics, electric power, chemical industry, textiles, and building materials. Under the leadership of the Party committee, each enterprise formed review groups consisting of factory leaders, workers, technicians, designers, and teachers and students from universities and colleges to review the process, equipment, and factory design of each project. Many factories organized designers to first engage in theoretical discussions and then practical work, in order to unify understanding. At the same time, they posted design drawings and mobilized all factory workers to conduct extensive airing of views, big blooming, and great debates. This approach broke through superstitions such as "workers dare not touch designs" and "design is the business of specialized technicians." In just a few days, the walls of many factories were covered with big-character posters about revising designs. Based on practical production experience, many workers exposed two common problems in the designs: insufficient reflection of new technologies and insufficient adaptation to local conditions. Many designers also criticized some designs for their shortcomings of mechanically copying and being detached from reality.

    Whether the process design is reasonable determines the level of labor productivity, the amount of equipment and materials selected, and the cost of investment, which is a fundamental issue related to the long-term plan of a factory. In this mass design review movement, all factories took the review of process design as the key to solving design problems. The Beijing Synthetic Petroleum Plant had fourteen reactors, each ten meters high and one and a half meters in diameter. These were the heart of the synthetic petroleum plant, and the technology was very complex. When reviewing the design, workers, based on their practical operating experience, and designers and students, based on their theoretical knowledge, jointly studied the design drawings overnight. They found that this reactor had a major flaw: water gas had to be heated in a heating furnace first, and then sent to the reactor for cooling. This was not only difficult to operate and repair, but also wasted steel. They proposed a reform plan of directly sending water gas to the reactor without heating or cooling. This could not only eliminate the heating furnace, but also reduce the hundred cooling tubes installed in the reactor to forty to fifty, saving a large amount of steel. The success of this process design modification further boosted everyone's confidence. In more than half a month, they modified a total of more than 190 unreasonable and unadvanced process designs without affecting production efficiency and quality, reducing the total investment by one-tenth and saving more than 870 tons of steel.

    In terms of equipment, through this mass review, many factories broke with the old idea of demanding precision and versatility everywhere, and adopted the method of adapting to local conditions and combining indigenous and foreign methods to overcome the difficulty of insufficient equipment supply. The machine tools and tools selected in the original design of the Beijing Boiler Factory had very high standards, which could not be resolved at present, hindering the rapid commissioning of the project. After studying the design review group of this factory, it was decided that in addition to adopting some precise and advanced key equipment, other equipment would currently be replaced by simple machine tools and special machine tools. Now, the workers of this factory have trial-produced more than 50 sets and pieces of machine tools and tools.

    In terms of factory design, units such as the Beijing Steam Turbine Plant, the Beijing Boiler Plant, and the Beijing Bearing Plant not only saved investment through reviewing and modifying designs, but also doubled the annual output compared with the original design. The Beijing No. 1 General Machinery Plant modified the unreasonable parts in the original design. In terms of civil engineering construction, the unnecessary building area was reduced by 3,760 square meters, saving nearly 240,000 yuan in investment; in terms of equipment, more than 80 machine tools with little use were cancelled, saving 3.7 million yuan in investment; in terms of organizational structure, the proportion of management personnel was too large, and the staffing is now being reorganized.

    In the mass design review movement, most factories and enterprises paid attention to comprehensively grasping the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. Save where it should be saved, and add where it should be added. For example, the personnel responsible for the design of the Beijing Electric Motor Factory once planned to replace mechanical spraying with manual operation and natural drying. The workers disagreed with this one-sided saving plan during the discussion. The workers said: "Using machinery can increase efficiency three times and avoid poisoning. The new modification plan does not consider production efficiency and the health of workers." (Zhou Dingfang)

    “三结合”设计先进工程
    北京工业部门广泛发动群众审查设计
    本报讯  北京工业部门发动广大群众审查了七十六项正在施工和尚未动工的工业设计，使这些设计作到了更加多快好省。
    这个群众性的审查设计运动是在中共北京市委直接领导下进行的。从10月下旬起，全市按冶金、机电、电力、化工、纺织和建筑材料等行业成立了九个领导小组。各个企业在党委领导下，由工厂负责人、工人、技术人员、设计人员和高等学校的教师、学生组成审查小组，对每项工程的工艺、设备和工厂设计逐项进行审查。许多工厂都组织设计人员先务虚，后务实，以便统一认识，同时把设计图纸张挂出来，发动全厂职工大鸣、大放、大辩论。这种做法，冲破了“工人不敢动设计”、“设计是专职技术人员的事”等等迷信。在短短的几天内，许多工厂的墙壁上，都贴满了关于修改设计的大字报。许多工人根据实际生产经验，揭发出不少设计的两种通病：反映新技术不够，因地制宜不够。不少设计人员也批评了一些设计中生搬硬套、脱离实际的缺点。
    工艺设计的是否合理，决定着劳动生产率的高低、选用设备和材料的多少和投资的省费，是关系一个工厂百年大计的根本问题。在这次群众性的审查设计运动中，各个工厂都以审查工艺设计为纲，来解决设计中的问题。北京人造石油厂有十四个十公尺高、直径一公尺半的反应器。它是人造石油厂的心脏，技术十分复杂。在审查设计时，工人们根据实际操作经验，设计人员和学生根据理论知识，共同对设计图纸研究了一夜。他们发现这种反应器有个很大的毛病，是先要在加热炉里把水煤气加热，然后又送到反应器里面冷却。这样，不但操作困难，不易检修，而且浪费钢材。他们提出了不用加热、冷却而直接把水煤气送到反应器里的改革方案。这样不仅可以省去加热炉，而且可以把装在反应器里的一百根冷却管削减成四十到五十根，节省大批钢材。这项工艺设计修改成功以后，更加鼓舞了大家的信心。在半个多月内，他们在不影响生产效率和质量的前提下，一共修改了一百九十多项不合理和不先进的工艺设计，使总投资降低十分之一，钢材节省八百七十多吨。
    在设备方面，经过这种群众性的审查，许多厂都打破了处处要精密、要万能的旧观念，采取了因地制宜、土洋结合的办法，来克服设备供应不足的困难。北京锅炉厂原设计中选用的机床和工具，标准很高，目前无法解决，妨碍工程迅速投入生产。这个工厂的设计审查小组研究以后，决定除采用部分精密的和高级的关键性设备外，其他设备目前都用简易机床和专用机床代替。现在，这个厂的工人已经试制成机床和工具五十多台、件。
    在工厂设计方面，北京汽轮机厂、北京锅炉厂、北京轴承厂等单位通过审查和修改设计，不仅节省了投资，还使年产量比原设计翻了一番。北京第一通用机械厂修改原设计中不合理的部分，土木建筑方面削减了不必要的建筑面积三千七百六十平方公尺，节约投资近二十四万元；设备方面，取消了八十多台用处不大的机床，节约投资三百七十万元；在组织机构方面，原来管理人员比例太大，现在正重新编制定员。
    在群众性的审查设计运动中，绝大部分工厂企业都注意了全面掌握多快好省的方针，该省则省，该添则添。例如，负责北京电机厂设计的人员，曾经计划用手工操作和自然干燥的方法来代替机械喷漆。工人们讨论时，不同意这个片面节约的方案。工人们说：“使用机械，可以提高效率三倍，而且不会中毒。新的修改方案没有考虑生产效率和工人的健康。”    （周定舫）
