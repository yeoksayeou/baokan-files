Resolution on Several Questions Regarding People's Communes
    Adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    December 10, 1958

    I.

    In 1958, a new social organization, like the rising sun, appeared on the broad horizon of eastern Asia. This is the large-scale people's commune in our country's rural areas, combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers into one, and integrating government administration with commune management. From its very emergence, it has attracted widespread attention with its powerful vitality.

    The development of the people's commune movement has been rapid. Starting in the summer of 1958, in just a few months, more than 740,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives across the country were reorganized into more than 26,000 people's communes based on the enthusiastic demands of the broad masses of farmers. More than 120 million households have joined the communes, accounting for more than 99 percent of the total number of farm households of all nationalities in the country. This situation shows that the emergence of people's communes is not accidental. It is the product of China's economic and political development, the product of the Party's socialist rectification movement, the general line of socialist construction, and the great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958.

    Although the establishment of rural people's communes has not been long, the broad masses of farmers have already seen the significant benefits it brings: labor and means of production can be arranged and dispatched in a larger scope in a unified way, and used more rationally and effectively than before, thus facilitating the development of production; industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs (where agriculture includes farming, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries) have been closely integrated and rapidly developed under the unified leadership of the commune, especially the construction of thousands upon thousands of small factories springing up like mushrooms in the countryside; the commune, in response to the urgent demands of the broad masses, has established a large number of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, which has particularly made the women, who have been confined to the kitchen stove for thousands of years, thoroughly liberated and smiling with joy; many communes, on the basis of huge agricultural yields, have implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply, and the vast number of male and female farmers have begun to receive their wages, while families who used to worry about food and drink, firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and vegetables can now “eat without money,” that is, they have obtained the most important and reliable social security. All of this is groundbreaking news for the farmers. The lives of the farmers have been improved, and based on practical experience and the prospects for the development of the commune, they know that their lives will be greatly improved in the future.

    The development of the rural people's commune system has even more far-reaching significance. This is: it points out the road for the gradual industrialization of the countryside, the road for the gradual transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in agriculture, the road for the gradual transition from socialist "distribution according to labor" (i.e., payment according to labor) to communist "distribution according to need" (i.e., each according to his needs), the road for the gradual reduction and even elimination of the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and manual labor, as well as the road for the gradual reduction and even disappearance of the state's internal functions.

    All of this proves that the resolution on establishing people's communes in rural areas made by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the Beidaihe Conference in August 1958 based on the creations of the masses is correct and of historical significance.

    People's communes have now been universally established in the rural areas of all nationalities (except Tibet and certain individual regions), and some experiments are also beginning in cities. In the future, people's communes in cities will also become a tool for transforming old cities and building new socialist cities in forms suitable for the characteristics of cities, a unified organizer of production, exchange, distribution, and people's livelihood and welfare, and a social organization combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers into one and integrating government administration with commune management. However, cities and rural areas are different. First, the situation in cities is more complex than in rural areas. Second, socialist ownership by the whole people is already the main form of ownership in cities, and factories, organs, and schools led by the working class (except for some family members of employees) have already been highly organized according to socialist principles. Therefore, the communization of cities cannot but put forward some requirements different from those in rural areas. Third, at present, the bourgeois ideology of many capitalists and intellectuals in cities is still quite strong. They still have concerns about the establishment of communes. We should also wait for these people. Therefore, pilot projects should be continued in cities, and there should be no rush to build them on a large scale. In large cities, we should slow down and only carry out preparatory work. We should wait until there is more experience and people who originally had ideological problems have come to understand before building them on a large scale.

    The established rural people's communes, because they have only been established for a short time, and most of the communes were busy with the intense work of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn sowing, and the mass steel smelting as soon as they were established, have not had time to consolidate their organizations, improve their systems, and systematically solve the new problems related to production, distribution, livelihood and welfare, and business management that have arisen due to the establishment of the communes. Everyone's experience in how to run and develop people's communes well is still insufficient, and it is inevitable that there will be some differences in understanding of certain issues. The current urgent task is to quickly unify the understanding of the whole Party and the whole people on the communes, strengthen leadership over the communes, rectify and consolidate the organizations of the communes, determine and improve the systems of the communes, and better organize the production and life of the communes. We must truly enrich the communes that have already been set up, so that they can increasingly fulfill the great mission of promoting the development of productive forces and relations of production.

    II.

    The people's commune is a grass-roots unit of China's socialist social structure that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers into one, and is also a grass-roots unit of the socialist political power organization. According to the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the preliminary experience of China's people's communes, it can now be predicted that people's communes will accelerate the speed of China's socialist construction and will become the best form for China to realize the following two transitions: first, to become the best form for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in China's rural areas; second, to become the best form for the transition from socialist society to communist society in China. It can now also be predicted that in the future communist society, people's communes will still be the basic unit of social structure.

    From now on, the task facing the Chinese people is: through the social organizational form of people's communes, in accordance with the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Party, to develop social productive forces at a high speed, promote national industrialization, commune industrialization, and agricultural mechanization and electrification, gradually transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, so that China's socialist economy will comprehensively realize ownership by the whole people, and gradually build China into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. In this process, communist factors will inevitably gradually increase, which will lay the foundation for the transition from socialism to communism in terms of both material and spiritual conditions.

    This is a very huge and complex task. Judging from the existing experience, under China's specific conditions, the time to fully realize socialist ownership by the whole people may be earlier, but it will not be very early. To widely realize national industrialization, commune industrialization, and agricultural mechanization and electrification, and to build a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, although we are moving forward at a faster pace, it will still take a long time; to complete this entire process, it will take fifteen, twenty, or even more years from now on.

    Imperialists and their echoers will say that we want to have highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and that this time is too short and we will not be able to achieve our goals. We have long been accustomed to this kind of tone and can ignore it; because they will always have to admit defeat in the face of facts. But there will be other people who say: this time is too long. These are well-intentioned people in our own ranks, but they are too impatient. They see highly developed modern industry, etc., as very easy, and they see the comprehensive realization of socialist ownership by the whole people and even the realization of communism as very easy. They believe that the rural people's communes are already owned by the whole people and that they can soon, or even now, abandon the socialist principle of distribution according to labor and adopt the communist principle of distribution according to need. Therefore, they cannot understand that the socialist system will continue for a very long time. This is of course a misunderstanding, and this misunderstanding must be eliminated.

    It must be pointed out that the transformation from agricultural production cooperatives to people's communes, the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and the transition from socialism to communism are several processes that are interrelated but also different.

    First, the transformation of agricultural production cooperatives into people's communes has expanded and improved the original collective ownership and has brought some elements of ownership by the whole people, but this does not mean that collective ownership in rural areas has been transformed into ownership by the whole people. Now that the entire rural area has been communized, it will still take a considerable amount of time to realize ownership by the whole people in the entire rural area.

    It is true that the establishment of people's communes has added some elements of ownership by the whole people to the collective ownership economy. This is due to the integration of rural people's communes and grass-roots political power; due to the decentralization of the original state-owned banks, shops, and certain other enterprises in rural areas to the management of the commune; due to the commune's participation in establishing certain industrial and other construction undertakings with the nature of ownership by the whole people; due to the establishment of county federations of communes that uniformly lead all communes in the county, and the county federations have the right to dispatch appropriate parts of the communes' manpower, materials, and financial resources to carry out construction undertakings throughout the county or beyond the county's scope, and many places have already started to carry out these undertakings; and so on. However, the means of production and products of rural people's communes are now basically still collectively owned by the commune, which is different from the means of production and products of state-owned enterprises being owned by the whole people. Both collective ownership and ownership by the whole people are socialist ownership, but ownership by the whole people is more advanced than collective ownership, because the means of production and products of enterprises owned by the whole people can be directly distributed by the state, which represents the entire people, in a unified and rational way according to the needs of the entire national economy, while enterprises under collective ownership, including the current rural people's communes, cannot do this. It is not in line with the actual situation to think that the ownership of the current rural people's communes is already ownership by the whole people.

    In order to gradually promote the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, counties should universally establish county federations of communes. In the next few years, the county federations should take appropriate steps to gradually increase the proportion of the commune's means of production that are owned by the whole people and gradually increase the proportion of the commune's products that are uniformly distributed by the state, and transform collective ownership into ownership by the whole people when conditions are ripe, on the basis of vigorously developing production and improving people's awareness. If this transformation is not developed and completed in time, and the status quo of collective ownership is maintained, so that the horizons of the commune members are only limited to the circle of collective interests in a smaller scope, then it will hinder the continued development of social productive forces and the continued improvement of people's awareness, and therefore it is inappropriate. However, it must be pointed out that collective ownership still has its positive role for the production development of today's rural people's communes. The timing of the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people depends on the objectively existing situation of the level of production development and the level of people's awareness, and cannot be left to people's subjective wishes, to be delayed or advanced as they please. Therefore, this transition can only be realized in stages and batches throughout the country after a considerable period of time. If these are not seen, and the establishment of communes is confused with the realization of ownership by the whole people, and one is too impatient and attempts to negate collective ownership prematurely in rural areas and hastily change to ownership by the whole people, then it is also inappropriate and therefore impossible to succeed.

    Second, the transformation from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people is not equal to the transformation from socialism to communism. The transformation of agricultural production cooperatives into people's communes is even less equal to the transformation from socialism to communism. The transition from socialism to communism requires a much longer time than the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people.

    It is true that the supply system implemented by the people's communes has begun to have the sprouts of the communist principle of distribution according to need; the principle of simultaneous development and mutual integration of industry and agriculture implemented by the people's communes has opened up the way to reduce the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants; after the rural people's communes transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, their communist elements will have new growth; these should all be recognized. Moreover, as social products gradually become abundant from not abundant due to the increasingly high tide of industry and agriculture throughout the country, the supply part of the commune's distribution system gradually increases from less to more, the supply standard gradually increases from low to high, and people's communist awareness is increasingly improved, universal education is increasingly developed, the differences between mental and manual labor are gradually reduced, and the state's political power's internal role is gradually reduced, etc., with all of this, the conditions for preparing for the transition to communism will gradually mature. It is naturally inappropriate to ignore or even hinder this development process and push communism to a distant future.

    However, every Marxist must clearly recognize that the transition from socialism to communism is a rather long and complex development process, and throughout this entire process, the nature of society is still socialist. Socialist society and communist society are two stages with different levels of economic development. The principle of socialism is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work"; the principle of communism is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." The communist distribution system is more rational, but it can only be realized after social products are extremely abundant. Negating the principle of distribution according to labor without this condition will hinder people's enthusiasm for labor, which will be detrimental to the development of production and the increase of social products, and will also be detrimental to promoting the realization of communism. Therefore, in the income of the members of the people's commune, the wage part distributed according to labor must occupy an important position for a long time, and will occupy a major position for a period of time. In order to promote the enthusiasm of the members for labor, and also to make it easier for the members to meet the complex needs in their lives, the commune must strive to gradually increase the wages earned by the members, and must increase them faster than the supply part in several years. Even after the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, the people's commune will still retain the system of distribution according to labor for a necessary historical period because social products have not yet been abundant enough to realize communism. It is undoubtedly an impossible fantasy to attempt to negate the principle of distribution according to labor prematurely and replace it with the principle of distribution according to need, that is, to attempt to enter communism forcibly when conditions are not ripe.

    Whether it is the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, or the transition from socialism to communism, it must be based on a certain level of development of productive forces. The relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces. Only when the productive forces develop to a certain state will certain changes in the relations of production be caused. This is a basic principle of Marxism. Comrades must remember that the current level of development of productive forces in our country is still very low after all. After three years of hard work, plus a few more years of effort, the national economic outlook can have a great change, but at that time there will still be a considerable distance from the goal of national high industrialization and national agricultural mechanization and electrification; as for the goals of greatly abundant social products, greatly reduced labor intensity, and greatly shortened working hours, there will be an even longer distance. Without these, it is of course impossible to talk about entering a higher stage of development of human society - communism. Therefore, since we are enthusiastic about the cause of communism, we must first be enthusiastic about developing our productive forces and first use great efforts to realize our socialist industrialization plan, and we should not declare without basis that the rural people's communes "immediately implement ownership by the whole people" or even "immediately enter communism," etc. To do so is not only a manifestation of rashness, but also will greatly lower the standard of communism in the minds of the people, distort and vulgarize the great ideal of communism, promote the petty-bourgeois egalitarianism trend, and be detrimental to the development of socialist construction.

    On the issue of the transition from socialism to communism, we cannot stand still in the socialist stage, but we cannot fall into the fantasy of surpassing the socialist stage and jumping into the communist stage. We are Marxist-Leninist believers in continuous revolution. We believe that there is no Great Wall between democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and between socialism and communism, nor is it allowed to be separated by a Great Wall; we are also Marxist-Leninist believers in the stage theory of revolutionary development. We believe that different stages of development reflect qualitative changes in things, and these stages of different qualities should not be confused with each other. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee clearly pointed out in its August resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas: The people's commune "is a process of transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. Some places may be faster and can be completed within three or four years, while some places may be slower and will take five or six years or even longer. After the transition to ownership by the whole people, like state-owned industry, its nature is still socialist, from each according to his ability, to each according to his work. Then, after many years, social products are extremely abundant, the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of all the people are greatly improved, universal education is popularized and improved, the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental labor and physical labor, which the old society left behind and which must still be preserved in the socialist period, are gradually eliminated, the remnants of unequal bourgeois rights that reflect these differences are also gradually eliminated, and the state functions are only to deal with the invasion of external enemies and no longer work internally. At this time, our society will enter the communist era of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." In order to clarify some misunderstandings about the people's commune issue at present and ensure the healthy development of the people's commune movement, it is necessary to seriously carry out widespread and repeated propaganda and education work among the whole Party and the people of the whole country with this Marxist-Leninist point of view.

    III.

    The production, exchange, consumption, and accumulation of the people's commune must be planned. The plan of the people's commune should be included in the national plan and be subject to national management. At the same time, when formulating the plan, it should give full play to its own characteristics and initiative.

    Developing production is the central link to consolidate and improve the people's commune. The correct policy for the people's commune to develop production should be: according to the unified national plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions, according to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production. In all aspects of production and capital construction, it is necessary to practice strict economy, careful calculation, and rational use of manpower, materials, and financial resources as much as possible, reduce costs, reduce expenditures, increase income, and prevent and oppose the phenomenon of extravagance and waste among some commune staff due to the bumper harvest.

    In terms of agricultural production, we should gradually change from shallow plowing and extensive cultivation and sparse harvesting to deep plowing and intensive cultivation and less planting and more harvesting, realize the gardenization of cultivation and the mechanization and electrification of the production process, greatly increase the yield per unit area, increase labor productivity, and gradually reduce the area of cultivated land and the labor force used in agriculture. We should strive to achieve an average annual grain production of 2,000 to 3,000 jin (1 to 1.5 tons) per capita in the country in a relatively short period of time. With the solution of the grain problem, we should gradually increase the proportion of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, hemp, silk, soybeans, oilseeds, sugar crops, tea, tobacco, and medicinal herbs in the total agricultural production, and pay great attention to accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In short, just like on the industrial front, we must have a full-line revolution in the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and completely change the face of the entire agricultural front.

    In the past, people often worried that we had a large population and little arable land. But the fact of the great agricultural harvest in 1958 overturned this conclusion. As long as we seriously promote the experience of deep plowing and intensive cultivation, layered fertilization, and rational close planting to obtain extremely large high-yield harvests, the arable land is not small, but large, and the population is not large, but feels a shortage of labor. This will be a very big change. We should strive to gradually reduce the existing cultivated land area for growing crops to about one-third or so in several years, depending on local conditions, while implementing crop rotation on the remaining part of the land, planting pasture grass and fertilizer grass, and planting trees and forests and digging lakes to store water on another part of the land. A wide variety of ornamental plants can be planted on the plains, mountains, and water surfaces to realize the landscaping of the land. In this way, one can greatly save water, fertilizer, and manpower on farmland and greatly increase the fertility of the soil; second, one can greatly develop the benefits of mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, and greatly develop the comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; third, one can transform the natural environment and beautify the whole of China. This is a great ideal that can be realized, and the people's communes in the rural areas of the country should all work hard for this.

    People's communes must run industry in a big way. The development of commune industry will not only accelerate the process of national industrialization, but also promote the realization of ownership by the whole people in rural areas and narrow the gap between cities and rural areas. According to the different conditions of each people's commune, a suitable number of the labor force should be gradually transferred from agriculture to industry, and the production of light and heavy industries such as fertilizer, pesticides, farm tools and agricultural machinery, building materials, processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural products, sugar production, textiles, papermaking, mining, metallurgy, and electricity should be planned and developed. The industrial production of people's communes must be closely integrated with agricultural production, first to serve the development of agriculture and the realization of agricultural machinery and electrification, and also to meet the daily needs of the members, and also to serve the national large-scale industry and the socialist market. We must fully pay attention to the principles of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, and not run industries that do not have local raw materials and need to get raw materials from very far away, so as to avoid increasing costs and wasting labor. In terms of production technology, the principle of combining handicraft industry and machine industry, and combining indigenous production methods and foreign production methods should be implemented. All handicraft industries that originally have a foundation and have development prospects must continue to develop and gradually carry out necessary technical reforms. Machine industry must also make full use of indigenous iron and steel, indigenous machine tools, and other various indigenous raw materials, indigenous equipment, and indigenous methods, and gradually move from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, and from low to high.

    Whether in industry or agriculture, people's communes must not only develop self-sufficient production that directly meets the needs of the commune, but also develop commodity production as widely as possible. Each commune should, according to its own characteristics, under the leadership of the state, implement necessary production division of labor and commodity exchange with other communes and state-owned enterprises. Only in this way can the entire social economy develop forward at a faster pace, and each commune can exchange for the necessary machinery and equipment to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, and also exchange for the necessary consumer goods and cash to supply the members and pay wages, and to gradually increase wages. In order to ensure the realization of the exchange plan, a contract system should be widely implemented between the state and the commune, and between communes.

    It should be emphasized that in the necessary historical period in the future, the commodity production of people's communes, as well as the commodity exchange between the state and the commune and between communes, must have a great development. This kind of commodity production and commodity exchange is different from capitalist commodity production and commodity exchange, because they are carried out in a planned way on the basis of socialist public ownership, rather than anarchically on the basis of capitalist private ownership. Continuing to develop commodity production and continuing to maintain the principle of distribution according to labor are two major principles for developing the socialist economy, and a unified understanding must be reached in the whole Party. Some people, while attempting to "enter communism" too early, attempt to abolish commodity production and commodity exchange too early, and to negate the positive role of commodities, value, currency, and prices too early. This kind of thinking is detrimental to the development of socialist construction and is therefore incorrect.

    IV.

    Rural people's communes should correctly distribute their income under the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily. In order to rapidly develop production, after deducting production costs, management fees, and taxes from the total income, the proportion of accumulation should be appropriately increased. However, on the basis of production development, the part of the income used for the individual consumption and collective consumption of the members (including the part used for public welfare, cultural education, and other undertakings) should also be increased year by year, so that the people's lives are improved year by year.

    Implementing a distribution system combining wages and supply in the part distributed for the individual consumption of the members is a creation of our country's people's communes in the socialist distribution method and is the urgent demand of the broad masses of members at present. As mentioned above, this distribution system has the sprouts of communism, the principle of distribution according to need, but its basic nature is still socialist, from each according to his ability, to each according to his work.

    How much of the total amount distributed to the members is accounted for by the wage part and the supply part depends on the different production development situations of each commune. At present, when determining the proportion of wages and supply, attention should be paid to try not to reduce the income of households with strong labor and small populations; generally, the income of more than 90 percent of the members should be increased compared with the previous year, and the income of the remaining members should not be reduced compared with the previous year.

    The scope of supply should not be too wide at present. Implementing the supply system is not to make people's lives uniform. Under the socialist and communist systems, people's needs are always roughly the same but also different. Therefore, whether at present or in the future, within the scope of supply, attention must be paid to giving the members as much freedom of choice as possible.

    With the development of production, wages must gradually increase. In addition to the supply part, the wage grades in rural areas can generally be divided into six to eight grades. The highest wage can be equal to four times the lowest wage, or even a little more, but it should not be too disparate, because that would not be in line with the actual situation of the current differences in the level of labor proficiency in rural areas. There is also allowed to be considerable differences in wage levels in different regions. At present, the wage differences in cities are larger than in rural areas, which is necessary. In the future, when production has greatly increased and everyone is wealthy, whether in cities or rural areas, the differences in these wage grades will appear unnecessary and gradually disappear, which will be close to the era of communism.

    The wage level in cities is generally higher than in rural areas, which has many reasons (including the higher cost of living in cities), and it is also a temporary phenomenon, which should be explained to the peasants. Some members in rural areas, in addition to their own labor, have family members working elsewhere (such as some workers, soldiers, cadres, overseas Chinese, etc.) who send money back from cities or other places. In this situation, other members should be educated not to haggle over every detail. When distributing, the commune should treat such members equally, whether in the supply part or the wage part, and should not force them to invest in the commune or donate. If they rely on people working elsewhere to maintain their entire lives, the commune should not interfere, but may not provide additional supply. For students studying elsewhere, except for those who are supplied by the state or can supply themselves, their needs should be uniformly resolved by the county federation of communes according to the fee standards stipulated by the school.

    The more socialist undertakings develop and the more abundant social products become, the more abundant the means of livelihood allocated to individuals will inevitably be. Some people think that communization is to redistribute the existing consumer property of individuals, which is a misunderstanding. It should be announced to the masses that the means of livelihood owned by the members personally (including houses, clothing, furniture, etc.) and the deposits in banks and credit cooperatives will still belong to the members after communization and will always belong to the members. If the commune needs to borrow the members' surplus houses, it can borrow them with the members' consent, but the ownership still belongs to the original owner. Members can retain the scattered trees, small farm tools, small tools, small livestock, and poultry next to their homes; they can also continue to engage in some small family sideline occupations provided that they do not hinder participation in collective labor.

    Debts left over from before the establishment of the people's commune, whether they are debts between individuals, debts between the commune and the members, or loans from the bank and credit cooperatives owed by the members, should not be declared abolished. For these debts, those who can repay them should repay them as before, and those who cannot repay them should be temporarily retained.

    V.

    The people's commune is the organizer of the people's production and life, and the fundamental purpose of developing production is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of all members of society. When the Party leads the work of the commune, it must pay attention to grasping ideology, production, and life in an all-round way. It must care about people and correct the tendency of seeing things but not people. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care about the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be. The view that opposes production and life and believes that emphasizing the lives of the masses will hinder production is wrong. Of course, it is also wrong to unilaterally or excessively emphasize improving life without raising awareness and developing production, and without advocating hard struggle for long-term interests.

    Communists have always believed that in communist society, labor will "become a pleasure instead of a heavy burden" and become "life's prime want." The time spent working each day will undoubtedly be greatly shortened in the future. With the development of mechanization and electrification, we must strive to begin implementing a six-hour workday system in the next few years. Our current intensive labor is precisely to create conditions for the future six-hour workday or even shorter working hours. In the current period, not only in cities, but also in rural areas, a system of actually working eight hours and studying two hours on weekdays should be implemented. When farming is busy or other work in rural areas is particularly busy, working hours can be appropriately extended. But in any case, it must be guaranteed that there are eight hours of sleep, four hours for meals and rest, a total of twelve hours every day, and this time must not be reduced. The fact that there is a shortage of labor at present is a fact, but we must focus on finding a way out in improving tool reform and improving labor organization, rather than expecting to find a way out in extending working hours. We must focus on paying attention to safe production, improving working conditions as much as possible, and striving to reduce and avoid industrial accidents. We must ensure that women have sufficient rest before and after childbirth, and women must also be given the necessary rest during menstruation, not doing heavy work, not going into cold water, and not staying up late.

    Public canteens must be well managed. It is necessary to ensure that all members eat enough, eat well, and eat cleanly and hygienically, and that it is suitable for national customs and local customs. Public canteens should have dining halls, and should manage vegetable gardens, tofu workshops, flour mills, and sauce gardens well, and raise pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and fish. Meals should be diversified and have flavor. We should consult with nutritionists to ensure that the food contains the calories and nutrients necessary for physiology. The elderly, children, patients, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers should be given necessary and possible care in their meals, and some members may be allowed to cook at home. Public canteens should implement democratic management. The managers and cooks of the canteen should be selected from politically reliable personnel, preferably through democratic elections.

    Nurseries and kindergartens should be well managed, so that every child lives better and is better educated than at home, so that children are willing to stay there and parents are willing to put their children there. Parents can decide whether their children need to board, and can take their children back at any time. In order to run nurseries and kindergartens well, communes must train a large number of qualified nursery workers and teachers for nurseries and kindergartens.

    Homes for the elderly should be well managed to provide a better living place for the elderly who have no children to rely on ("five guarantees" households).

    Communes must also be responsible for running primary schools, secondary schools, and adult education well. Primary school education should be universalized in rural areas across the country, and full-time secondary schools and part-time agricultural secondary schools, or other secondary vocational schools, should be run well, and secondary education should be gradually universalized. Illiteracy should be seriously eliminated among adults, and various spare-time schools should be organized to conduct political, cultural, and technical education. Implementing universal education among the working people and gradually improving the level of education is a major step in narrowing the gap between manual labor and mental labor, and it must be carried out seriously. In addition, each commune must also select some young people to apply for high schools, secondary vocational schools, and universities in cities, in order to train staff with higher cultural levels for the country and the commune. No matter what kind of school it is, the principle of combining education with productive labor must be implemented. Children over the age of nine can participate in some labor appropriately in order to develop labor habits from an early age and promote physical and mental development; but the health of children must be fully taken into account, and light, short-term labor suitable for children's physical strength and interests should be assigned.

    We must strengthen the ideological and political work of the staff in public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, primary schools, health centers, clubs, shops, etc., and actively guide public opinion, so that the entire society and the entire commune regard running public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other collective livelihood and welfare undertakings well and doing service work well as a noble work to serve the people. We must criticize and correct the exploiting class viewpoint that despises the livelihood and welfare work of the masses and despises service labor.

    The existing old-style houses should be gradually transformed, and new, garden-style townships and village residential areas should be built in stages and batches, including houses, public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, factories, threshing grounds, livestock sheds, shops, post offices, warehouses, schools, hospitals,

    关于人民公社若干问题的决议
    中国共产党第八届中央委员会第六次全体会议通过
    一九五八年十二月十日
    一
    一九五八年，一种新的社会组织像初升的太阳一样，在亚洲东部的广阔的地平线上出现了，这就是我国农村中的大规模的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。它一出现，就以它的强大的生命力，引起了人们广泛的注意。
    人民公社运动的发展很快。从一九五八年夏季开始，只经过了几个月时间，全国七十四万多个农业生产合作社，就已经在广大农民的热烈要求的基础上，改组成了二万六千多个人民公社。参加公社的有一亿二千多万户，已经占全国各民族农户总数的百分之九十九以上。这个情况表明：人民公社的出现不是偶然的，它是我国经济和政治发展的产物，是党的社会主义整风运动、社会主义建设总路线和一九五八年社会主义建设大跃进的产物。
    农村人民公社成立的时间虽然不久，但是广大农民已经看到了它所带来的显著利益：劳动力和生产资料可以在更大的范围内作统一的安排和调度，比以前得到更合理、更有效的使用，因而更便于发展生产；工农商学兵各项事业（其中的农又包括农林牧副渔五业），在公社的统一领导下，得到了密切的结合和迅速的发展，特别是成千成万的小工厂在农村中雨后春笋般地兴建了起来；公社适应广大群众的迫切要求，创办了大量的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业，这就特别使得几千年来屈伏在锅灶旁边的妇女得到了彻底的解放而笑逐颜开；很多公社在农业巨大丰产的基础上，实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，广大的男女农民开始领得自己的工资，而过去经常愁吃愁喝、愁柴米油盐酱醋菜的家庭，从此可以“吃饭不要钱”，也就是说，得到了最重要和最可靠的社会保险。所有这些，对于农民都是开天辟地的新闻。农民的生活已经得到了改善，而且根据实际的经验和公社发展的远景，他们知道，他们的生活在今后还将大大改善。
    农村人民公社制度的发展，还有更为深远的意义。这就是：它为我国人民指出了农村逐步工业化的道路，农业中的集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制的道路。社会主义的“按劳分配”（即按劳付酬）逐步过渡到共产主义的“按需分配”（即各取所需）的道路，城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别逐步缩小以至消失的道路，以及国家对内职能逐步缩小以至消失的道路。
    这一切都证明，中共中央政治局在一九五八年八月北戴河会议上根据群众的创造所作的关于在农村中建立人民公社的决议，是正确的，是具有历史意义的。
    人民公社现在在各民族农村中（除西藏和某些个别地区以外）已经普遍地建立起来了，在城市中也在开始进行一些试验。城市中的人民公社，将来也会以适合城市特点的形式，成为改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市的工具，成为生产、交换、分配和人民生活福利的统一组织者，成为工农商学兵相结合和政社合一的社会组织。但是城市和农村有所不同。一则城市的情况比农村复杂。再则社会主义的全民所有制在城市中已经是所有制的主要形式了，工人阶级领导的工厂、机关、学校（除一部分职工家属以外）已经按照社会主义原则高度组织化了，因而城市的公社化不能不提出一些同农村不同的要求。三则目前城市中的资本家和知识分子中许多人的资产阶级思想还相当浓厚，他们对于成立公社还有顾虑，对于这一部分人，我们也应当有所等待。因此，在城市中应当继续试点，一般不忙大量兴办，在大城市中更要从缓，只作酝酿工作。要等到经验多了，原来思想不通的人也通了，再大量兴办起来。
    已经建立起来的农村人民公社，由于成立的时间还很短，绝大多数的公社刚一建立，就忙于秋收、秋耕、秋种和全民炼钢铁的紧张工作，还没有来得及巩固组织，健全制度，系统地解决由于成立公社而发生的关于生产、分配、生活福利、经营管理等方面的新问题。对于如何办好和发展人民公社，大家的经验还不足，对于某些问题的认识也难免有一些参差不齐。目前的迫切任务，就是要迅速统一全党全民对于公社的认识，加强对于公社的领导，整顿和巩固公社的组织，确定和健全公社的制度，更好地组织公社的生产和生活。要把已经搭起架子的公社切实充实起来，以便使它们能够日益完满地担负起促进生产力和生产关系向前发展的伟大使命。
    二
    人民公社是我国社会主义社会结构的工农商学兵相结合的基层单位，同时又是社会主义政权组织的基层单位。根据马克思列宁主义的理论和我国人民公社的初步经验，现在可以预料：人民公社将加快我国社会主义建设的速度，并且将成为我国实现下述两个过渡的最好的形式，即第一，成为我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的最好的形式；第二，成为我国由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好的形式。现在也可以预料，在将来的共产主义社会，人民公社将仍然是社会结构的基层单位。
    从现在开始，摆在我国人民面前的任务是：经过人民公社这种社会组织形式，根据党所提出的社会主义建设的总路线，高速度地发展社会生产力，促进国家工业化、公社工业化、农业机械化电气化，逐步地使社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，从而使我国的社会主义经济全面地实现全民所有制，逐步地把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。在这一过程中，共产主义的因素必将逐步增长，这就将在物质条件方面和精神条件方面为社会主义过渡到共产主义奠定基础。
    这是一个十分巨大的复杂的任务。从现有的经验看来，在我国的具体条件下，全面地实现社会主义的全民所有制的时间可能早一些，但是也不会很早。广泛地实现国家工业化、公社工业化和农业机械化电气化，建成具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，尽管我们前进的速度较快，需要的时间还将很长；全部完成这个过程，从现在起，将需要经历十五年、二十年或者更多一些的时间。
    帝国主义者和他们的应声虫将说，我们想有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化，这个时间是太短了，我们将不能达到目的。这种调子我们早已听惯了，可以不去管它；因为他们总是要不断地在事实面前认输的。但是还会有另外一些人说：这个时间太长了。这是我们自己队伍中的好心人，只是太性急了，他们把高度发展的现代工业等等看得非常容易，把全面地实现社会主义的全民所有制以至实现共产主义看得非常容易。他们认为，农村人民公社现在就已经属于全民所有制性质了，很快就可以甚至现在就可以放弃按劳分配的社会主义原则，采取按需分配的共产主义原则了。因此，他们对于社会主义制度还要继续一个很长的时间，觉得不能理解。这当然是一种误解，这种误解必须消除。
    必须指出：由农业生产合作社到人民公社的转变，由社会主义的集体所有制到社会主义的全民所有制的过渡，由社会主义到共产主义的过渡，这些是互相联系而又互相区别的几种过程。
    首先，农业生产合作社变为人民公社，使原有的集体所有制扩大了和提高了，并且带上了若干全民所有制的成分，但是这并不等于已经把农村中的集体所有制变成了全民所有制。现在全国农村已经公社化了，但是要在全国农村实现全民所有制，还需要经过一段相当的时间。
    不错，人民公社的建立，使集体所有制的经济增加了若干全民所有制的成分。这是由于农村的人民公社和基层政权合而为一；由于农村中原有的全民所有制的银行、商店和某些其他企业下放到公社管理；由于公社参加兴办某些具有全民所有制性质的工业和其他建设事业；由于许多县成立了统一领导全县公社的县联社，县联社有权调度各公社的适当部分的人力、物力和财力，去进行全县性的或者超过县的范围的建设事业，并且许多地方已经在着手进行这些事业；等等。但是农村人民公社的生产资料和产品，现在基本上仍然属于公社集体所有，同国营企业的生产资料和产品属于全民所有不同。集体所有制和全民所有制都是社会主义的所有制，但是全民所有制比集体所有制更进步，因为全民所有制企业的生产资料和产品，可以直接由代表全体人民的国家按照整个国民经济的需要作统一的合理的分配，而集体所有制的企业，包括目前的农村人民公社，却不能作到这一点。认为目前的农村人民公社的所有制已经是全民所有制，是不符合实际情况的。
    为了逐步促进集体所有制向全民所有制过渡，各县应当普遍地成立县联社。县联社应当在今后若干年内，在大力发展生产和提高人民觉悟的基础上，采取适当步骤，逐步增加公社生产资料的全民性部分，逐步增加公社产品由国家统一分配的部分，并且在条件成熟的时候把集体所有制转为全民所有制。如果不及时地发展和完成这种转变，老是维持集体所有制的现状，让公社社员的眼光只是局限在较小范围的集体利益的圈子里，那就将妨碍社会生产力的继续发展和人民觉悟的继续提高，因而是不适当的。但是必须指出，集体所有制对于今天的农村人民公社的生产发展，仍然有它的积极作用。集体所有制向全民所有制过渡的迟早，取决于生产发展的水平和人民觉悟的水平这些客观存在的形势，而不能听凭人们的主观愿望，想迟就迟，想早就早。因此，这个过渡只有经过一个相当长的时间，才能在全国范围内分期分批地实现。如果看不到这些，把成立公社和实现全民所有制混为一谈，过于性急，企图在农村中过早地否定集体所有制，匆忙地改变为全民所有制，那也是不适当的，因而是不可能成功的。
    其次，由社会主义的集体所有制变为社会主义的全民所有制，并不等于由社会主义变为共产主义。农业生产合作社变为人民公社，更不等于由社会主义变为共产主义。由社会主义变为共产主义，比由社会主义的集体所有制变为社会主义的全民所有制，需要经过更长得多的时间。
    不错，人民公社实行的供给制，开始带有共产主义的按需分配原则的萌芽；人民公社实行的工农业同时并举和互相结合的方针，为缩小城乡差别、工农差别开辟了道路；农村人民公社由社会主义的集体所有制过渡到了社会主义的全民所有制以后，它的共产主义因素将有新的增长；这些都是应当承认的。而且，随着社会产品由于全国工农业日益高涨，逐步由不丰富到丰富，公社分配制度中的供给部分逐步由少到多、供给标准逐步由低到高，以及人民共产主义觉悟日益提高，全民教育日益发展，脑力劳动和体力劳动差别逐步缩小，国家政权对内作用逐步缩小，等等，随着这一切，准备向共产主义过渡的条件也将逐步成熟起来。忽视甚至阻碍这个发展过程，把共产主义推向遥远的将来，自然是不适当的。
    但是每一个马克思主义者必须清醒地认识到，由社会主义过渡到共产主义是一个相当长相当复杂的发展过程，而在这整个过程中，社会的性质仍然是社会主义的。社会主义社会和共产主义社会是经济上发展程度不同的两个阶段。社会主义的原则是“各尽所能，按劳分配”；共产主义的原则是“各尽所能，按需分配”。共产主义的分配制度更合理，但是这只有在社会产品极大地丰富了以后才可能实现。没有这个条件而否定按劳分配的原则，就会妨害人们劳动的积极性，就不利于生产的发展，不利于社会产品的增加，也就不利于促进共产主义的实现。因此，在人民公社的社员收入中，按劳分配的工资部分，在长时期内，必须占有重要地位，在一段时间内并将占有主要地位。为了促进社员劳动的积极性，也为了使社员在生活中的复杂的需要比较容易满足，公社必须努力使社员所得的工资逐步增加，并且在若干年内必须比供给部分增加得更快。即使已经由集体所有制过渡到了全民所有制以后，由于社会产品还没有丰富到足以实现共产主义，人民公社在一个必要的历史时期内仍然将保留按劳分配的制度。企图过早地否定按劳分配的原则而代之以按需分配的原则，也就是说，企图在条件不成熟的时候勉强进入共产主义，无疑是一个不可能成功的空想。
    无论由社会主义的集体所有制向社会主义的全民所有制过渡，还是由社会主义向共产主义过渡，都必须以一定程度的生产力发展为基础。生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质，只有生产力发展到某种状况才会引起生产关系的某种变革，这是马克思主义的一条基本原理。同志们要记着，我国现在的生产力发展水平，毕竟还是很低的。苦战三年，加上再努力若干年，全国的经济面貌可以有一个很大的改变，但是那时离开全国高度工业化、全国农业机械化电气化的目标，还将有一段不小的距离；至于离开社会产品大大丰富、劳动强度大大减轻、劳动时间大大缩短这些目标，就还有一段更长的距离。而没有这些，当然就谈不到进入人类社会的更高发展阶段——共产主义。因此，我们既然热心于共产主义事业，就必须首先热心于发展我们的生产力，首先用大力实现我们的社会主义工业化计划，而不应当无根据地宣布农村的人民公社“立即实行全民所有制”，甚至“立即进入共产主义”，等等。那样作，不仅是一种轻率的表现，而且将大大降低共产主义在人民心目中的标准，使共产主义伟大的理想受到歪曲和庸俗化，助长小资产阶级的平均主义倾向，不利于社会主义建设的发展。
    在由社会主义向共产主义过渡的问题上，我们不能在社会主义阶段上停步不前，但是也不能陷入超越社会主义阶段而跳入共产主义阶段的空想。我们是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者，我们认为，在民主革命和社会主义革命之间，在社会主义和共产主义之间，没有隔着也不允许隔着万里长城；我们又是马克思列宁主义的革命发展的阶段论者，我们认为不同的发展阶段反映事物的质的变化，不应当把这些不同质的阶段互相混淆起来。中央政治局关于在农村建立人民公社问题的八月决议中曾经明确指出：人民公社“由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡是一个过程，有些地方可能较快，三、四年内就可完成，有些地方可能较慢，需要五、六年或者更长一些的时间。过渡到了全民所有制，如国营工业那样，它的性质还是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳分配。然后再经过多少年，社会产品极大地丰富了，全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了，社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，都逐步地消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余，也逐步地消失了，国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了，在这种时候，我国社会就将进入各尽所能、按需分配的共产主义时代。”为了澄清目前有关人民公社问题的一些误解，保证人民公社运动的健康发展，必须认真地用这种马克思列宁主义的观点，在全党和全国人民中间，进行广泛的反复的宣传教育工作。
    三
    人民公社的生产、交换、消费和积累，都必须有计划。人民公社的计划应当纳入国家的计划，服从国家的管理。同时，它在制定计划的时候，应当充分发挥自己的特点和主动精神。
    发展生产是巩固和提高人民公社的中心环节。人民公社发展生产的正确方针应当是：根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，根据勤俭办社的原则，实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。无论在那一方面的生产中和基本建设中，都必须厉行节约，精打细算，尽可能合理地利用人力、物力和财力，降低成本，节减开支，增加收入，防止和反对有些公社工作人员因为丰收而发生铺张浪费的现象。
    在农业生产方面，应当逐步改变浅耕粗作、广种薄收为深耕细作、少种多收，实现耕作园田化和生产过程机械化、电气化，大大提高单位面积产量，提高劳动生产率，逐步缩减耕地面积和在农业方面所使用的劳动力。应当争取在一个较短的时期内，做到每年全国产粮平均每口人能有两千斤至三千斤，即一吨至一吨半。随着粮食问题的解决，应当逐步提高棉、麻、蚕丝、大豆、油料、糖料、茶叶、烟叶、药材等工业原料作物在全部农业生产当中所占的比重，并且极大地注意加速林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的发展。总之，如像在工业战线一样，一定要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。
    过去人们经常忧愁我们的人口多，耕地少。但是一九五八年农业大丰产的事实，把这种论断推翻了。只要认真推广深耕细作、分层施肥、合理密植而获得极其大量的高额丰产的经验，耕地就不是少了，而是多了，人口就不是多了，而是感到劳动力不足了。这将是一个极大的变化。应当争取在若干年内，根据地方条件，把现有种农作物的耕地面积逐步缩减到例如三分之一左右，而以其余的一部分土地实行轮休，种牧草、肥田草，另一部分土地植树造林，挖湖蓄水，在平地、山上和水面都可以大种其万紫千红的观赏植物，实行大地园林化。这样做，一可在农田上大大省水，省肥，省人力，而且将大大增加土壤的肥力；二可大兴山水草木之利，大大发展农林牧副渔的综合经营；三可改造自然环境，美化全中国。这是一个可以实现的伟大理想，全国农村中的人民公社都应当为此而努力。
    人民公社必须大办工业。公社工业的发展不但将加快国家工业化的进程，而且将在农村中促进全民所有制的实现，缩小城市和乡村的差别。应当根据各个人民公社的不同条件，逐步把一个适当数量的劳动力从农业方面转移到工业方面，有计划地发展肥料、农药、农具和农业机械、建筑材料、农产品加工和综合利用、制糖、纺织、造纸以及采矿、冶金、电力等轻重工业生产。人民公社的工业生产，必须同农业生产密切结合，首先为发展农业和实现农业机械化、电气化服务，同时为满足社员日常生活需要服务，又要为国家的大工业和社会主义的市场服务。必须充分注意因地制宜、就地取材的原则，不要办那些本地没有原材料、要到很远很远的地方去取原材料的工业，以免增加成本，浪费劳动力。在生产技术方面，应当实行手工业和机器工业相结合、土法生产和洋法生产相结合的原则。凡是原来有基础而又有发展前途的手工业，一定要继续发展，并且逐步进行必要的技术改革。机器工业也必须充分利用土钢铁、土机床和其他各种土原料、土设备、土办法，逐步由土到洋，由小到大，由低到高。
    人民公社无论在工业方面和农业方面，既要发展直接满足本社需要的自给性生产，又必须尽可能广泛地发展商品性生产。各个公社应当根据自己的特点，在国家领导下，同别的公社和国营企业实行必要的生产分工和商品交换。只有这样，整个社会经济才能够以较快的速度向前发展，而各个公社也才能够换回必要的机器和设备，实现农业机械化、电气化，也才能够换回所需要的消费物资和现金，以便供应社员和发放工资，并使工资逐步增长。为了保证交换计划的实现，要在国家和公社之间、公社和公社之间，广泛地实行合同制度。
    应当着重指出：在今后一个必要的历史时期内，人民公社的商品生产，以及国家和公社、公社和公社之间的商品交换，必须有一个很大的发展。这种商品生产和商品交换不同于资本主义的商品生产和商品交换，因为它们是在社会主义公有制的基础上有计划地进行的，而不是在资本主义私有制的基础上无政府状态地进行的。继续发展商品生产和继续保持按劳分配的原则，对于发展社会主义经济是两个重大的原则问题，必须在全党统一认识。有些人在企图过早地“进入共产主义”的同时，企图过早地取消商品生产和商品交换，过早地否定商品、价值、货币、价格的积极作用，这种想法是对于发展社会主义建设不利的，因而是不正确的。
    四
    农村的人民公社应当在勤俭办社的原则下，正确地分配自己的收入。为了迅速地发展生产，在从总收入扣除生产费用、管理费用和缴纳税款以后，应当适当地提高积累的比例。但是在生产发展的基础上，同时应当使收入中用于社员个人消费和集体消费的部分（包括用于公共福利、文化教育等事业的部分）逐年有所增加，使人民的生活逐年有所改善。
    在分配给社员个人消费的部分，实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，这是我国人民公社在社会主义分配方式上的一个创举，是目前广大社员群众的迫切要求。如前面所说，这种分配制度，具有共产主义的萌芽，但是它的基本性质仍然是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳分配。
    在分配给社员的总额当中，工资部分和供给部分各占多少，要看各个公社生产发展的不同情况来决定。目前在确定工资和供给的比例的时候，要注意尽量不使劳力强而人口少的户减少收入；一般地要使百分之九十以上的社员收入比上年有所增加，其余社员的收入比上年也不致减少。
    供给范围目前不宜过宽。实行供给制并不是使人们的生活清一色。在社会主义和共产主义制度下，人们的需要总是大体相同而又各有不同的。因此，无论在目前和将来，在供给的范围内，必须注意尽可能使社员有适当选择的自由。
    随着生产的发展，工资必须逐步增长。除供给部分外，目前农村中的工资等级一般可以分为六级至八级。最高工资可以等于最低工资的四倍，或者倍数更多一点，但是不要过于悬殊，因为那样就不符合于目前农村劳动熟练程度高低差别的实际情况。各个地区的工资水平也允许有相当的差别。目前城市中工资的差额要比农村大一些，这是必要的。到了将来，由于生产有了极大的高涨，所有一切人都富裕起来，无论在城市或者农村，这种工资等级的差别就会显得没有必要，而逐步趋于消失，那就是接近共产主义的时代了。
    城市的工资水平一般比农村为高，这有多方面的原因（包括城市中的生活费用较高这样一个原因），而且也是一种暂时现象，应当向农民讲清楚。农村中有些社员除自己劳动外，家中还有外出人员（例如某些工人、军人、干部、华侨等）由城市或其他地方寄钱回来，对于这种情形，应当教育其他社员不必斤斤计较。公社在分配的时候，无论供给部分和工资部分，对于这样的社员都应当一视同仁，也不要勉强他们向公社投资，或者捐献。如果他们依靠外出人员维持全部生活，公社也不应当加以干涉，但是可以不另行供给。对于外出上学的学生，除由国家供给或者自己可以供给者外，他们的需要应当由县联社按照学校规定的费用标准，统一负责解决。
    社会主义事业愈是向前发展，社会产品愈是丰富，分配给个人所有的生活资料也必然愈是丰富。有些人以为公社化要把个人现有的消费财产拿来重分，这是一种误解。应当向群众宣布：社员个人所有的生活资料（包括房屋、衣被、家具等）和在银行、信用社的存款，在公社化以后，仍然归社员所有，而且永远归社员所有。社员多余的房屋，公社在必要时可以征得社员同意借用，但是所有权仍归原主。社员可以保留宅旁的零星树木、小农具、小工具、小家畜和家禽等；也可以在不妨碍参加集体劳动的条件下，继续经营一些家庭小副业。
    人民公社成立以前遗留下来的债务，不论是个人相互间的债务，公社和社员相互间的债务，或者社员欠银行、信用社的贷款，一律不要宣布废除。对于这些债务，凡有条件偿还的应当照旧偿还，没有条件偿还的暂时保留。
    五
    人民公社是人民的生产和生活的组织者，而发展生产的根本目的是最大限度地满足全体社会成员经常增长的物质和文化生活的需要。党在领导公社工作的时候，必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。必须关心人，纠正那种见物不见人的倾向。群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。把生产和生活对立起来，认为重视群众生活就会妨害生产的观点，是错误的。当然，离开提高觉悟和发展生产，片面地或者过分地强调改善生活，而不提倡为长远利益而艰苦奋斗，也是错误的。
    共产主义者从来都认为，在共产主义社会中，劳动将“从沉重的负担变成愉快”，成为“生活的第一需要”。将来每天劳动的时间无疑将大大缩短。随着机械化、电气化的发展，我们必须争取在今后若干年内开始实现每天劳动六小时的制度。我们目前的紧张劳动，也正是为将来的每天六小时劳动以至更短时间的劳动创造条件。在目前时期，不但在城市中，而且在农村中，应当实行平时实际工作八小时、学习二小时的制度。农忙或者农村其他工作特别忙的时候，工作时间可以适当延长一些。但是无论如何，必须保证每天睡眠八小时，吃饭、休息四小时，共十二小时，这个时间一定不可少。目前劳动力紧张，这是事实，但是要着重在搞好工具改革方面和改善劳动组织方面找出路，而不要指望在延长劳动时间方面找出路。必须着重注意安全生产，尽可能改善劳动条件，力求减少和避免工伤事故。一定要保证妇女在产前产后的充分的休息，在月经期内也一定要让妇女得到必要的休息，不做重活、不下冷水、不熬夜。
    要办好公共食堂。要保证所有的社员吃得饱、吃得好、吃得干净卫生，并且适合民族习惯和地方习惯。公共食堂要有饭厅，要经营好菜园、豆腐坊、粉坊、酱园，要养猪羊、养鸡鸭、养鱼等。饭菜要多样化，要有味道。要同营养学家商量，使食品当中包含有生理上必需的含热量和营养分。对老人、小孩、病人、孕产妇和哺乳的母亲，在伙食上要给以必要和可能的照顾，并且可以允许某些社员在家做饭吃。公共食堂要实行管理民主化。食堂的管理人员和炊事员要选择政治上可靠的人员担任，最好经过民主选举。
    要办好托儿所和幼儿园，使每一个孩子比在家里生活得好、教育得好，使孩子们愿意留在那里，父母也愿意把孩子放在那里。父母可以决定孩子是否需要寄宿，并且可以随时把孩子领回。为了办好托儿所和幼儿园，公社必须大量培养托儿所和幼儿园的合格的保育员和教师。
    要办好敬老院，为那些无子女依靠的老年人（“五保户”）提供一个较好的生活场所。
    公社还必须负责办好小学、中学和成人教育。要在全国农村中普及小学教育，办好全日制的中学和半日制的农业中学，或者其他中等职业学校，逐步做到普及中等教育。在成人中要认真地扫除文盲，组织各种业余学校，进行政治、文化和技术教育。在劳动人民中间实行普及教育，并且逐步提高教育水平，这是缩小体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别的一个重大步骤，必须认真进行。此外，各公社还必须选送一部分青年去投考城市中的高级中学、中等专业学校和高等学校，以便为国家和公社培养有较高文化水平的工作人员。无论那一种学校，都必须贯彻执行教育同生产劳动相结合的原则。九岁以上的儿童可以适当地参加一些劳动，以便自幼养成劳动习惯，促进身心发育；但是必须充分照顾到儿童的健康，分配以适合儿童体力和兴趣的轻微的、短时间的劳动。
    要加强公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、小学校、卫生院、俱乐部、商店等方面工作人员的思想政治工作，并且积极指导社会舆论，使整个社会和整个公社把办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和其他集体生活福利事业，作好服务性工作，看成是为人民服务的一种崇高的工作。要批判和纠正那种轻视群众生活福利工作、轻视服务性劳动的剥削阶级观点。
    要逐步改造现有的旧式房屋，分期分批地建设新型的园林化的乡镇和村的居民点，包括住宅、公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、工厂、禾场、畜舍、商店、邮电所、仓库、学校、医院、俱乐部、电影院、体育场、浴室、厕所等。乡镇和村居民点住宅的建设规划，要经过群众的充分讨论。我们主张废除历史上遗留下来的不合理的家长制，发展民主团结的家庭生活。这种主张得到群众的热烈欢迎。因此，在住宅建筑方面，必须注意使房屋适宜于每个家庭的男女老幼的团聚。
    现在世界上有一大堆蠢人，下死劲攻击我们的人民公社，其中就有美国的杜勒斯先生。这个杜勒斯，对于我国的事情，啥也不懂，却要装作一个中国通，疯狂地反对人民公社。特别使他伤心的是，据说，我们破坏了几千年传下来的好得不得了的家庭制度。不错，中国人民破坏了一个封建的家长制。须知这种家长制在资本主义社会中一般早已没有了，这是资本主义的一个进步。我们却更进一步，建立了民主团结的家庭，这在资本主义社会一般也是少有的。只有在将来，在那里实现了社会主义革命，消灭了人剥削人的资本主义制度以后，这样的家庭才有可能普遍出现。至于托儿所，幼儿园，工厂里的工人食堂，也是资本主义社会先有。不过，在那里，凡是由资产阶级举办的这类事业，都是资本主义性质的，目的在于便利资本家剥削男女劳动者。而我们所举办的这类事业，则是社会主义性质的，便利于社会主义事业的发展，便利于人类个性的解放，真正彻底地解放了妇女群众，并使儿童教养得更好些，因而得到全体劳动人民，首先是妇女群众的热烈欢迎。

    人民公社的组织原则是民主集中制。无论在生产管理方面，在收入分配方面，在社员生活福利工作方面，以及一切其他工作方面，都必须贯彻执行这个原则。
    人民公社应当实行统一领导、分级管理的制度。公社的管理机构，一般可以分为公社管理委员会、管理区（或生产大队）、生产队三级。管理区（或生产大队）一般是分片管理工农商学兵、进行经济核算的单位，盈亏由公社统一负责。生产队是组织劳动的基本单位。在公社管理委员会的统一领导下，应当使管理区（或生产大队）和生产队在组织生产和基本建设、管理财务、管理生活福利事业等方面，有必要的权力，以利于发挥他们的积极性。
    县联社和人民公社的各级组织，都必须学会在生产各部门（农业部门、工业部门、运输部门）之间，在经常性生产任务、突击性生产任务、服务性任务之间，合理地分配和调度劳动力，避免这里有事无人做、那里有人无事做的现象。必须不断地改进劳动组织工作，在生产任务和其他任务中继续执行和巩固分层包干的责任制，健全劳动检查和评奖的制度，切实保证提高劳动效率和工作质量。
    人民公社的劳动组织中必须既有纪律，又有民主。所谓组织军事化，也就是组织工厂化，就是说公社的劳动组织应当像工厂、像军队那样地有组织有纪律，这是大规模的农业生产所必需的。大规模的农业生产队伍同大规模的工业生产队伍一样，是一支产业军。近代的产业军，是资产阶级组织的，一个工厂就等于一个军营。工人站在机器面前，其纪律之严，不下于军队。社会主义社会的工业产业军，是工人阶级一个阶级的产业军，去掉了剥削剩余价值的资本家，在工人阶级内部实行了生动活泼的自觉自愿的民主集中制。我们现在把这个制度应用于农村，这样就建立了没有地主富农剥削、也脱离了小生产状态的社会主义的民主集中制的农业产业军。
    在人民公社的各级生产组织中，应当相应地建立民兵组织。民兵组织和生产组织的领导机构应当是两套，各级民兵组织的指挥员，即团长、营长、连长等，原则上不由公社的主任、管理区主任（大队长）、队长等兼任。这些指挥员应当参加公社的同级管理机构作为成员之一，受同级管理机构和上级民兵指挥机关的双重领导。民兵组织应当根据需要配备武器，武器由地方自办兵工厂生产。基干民兵要按照规定的时间进行军事训练，普通民兵也要在劳动间隙进行适当的训练，以便为实行全民皆兵准备条件。我国的广大劳动人民对于民兵制度是喜闻乐见的，其所以如此，因为他们在长期反对帝国主义、封建主义及其走狗国民党反动派的革命斗争中，认识到只有把自己武装起来，才能战胜武装的反革命，才能成为中国这块天地的主人；而在革命胜利之后，他们又看到，国外还有天天声言要灭掉这个人民国家的帝国主义强盗们存在；因此，全体人民决心继续把自己武装起来，并且声言：一心想要抢劫我们的强盗们，你们小心一点儿吧，不要妄想来碰我们这些从事和平劳动的人们，我们是准备好了的。帝国主义如果竟敢发动对我国的侵略战争，那时我们就将实现全民皆兵，民兵就将配合人民解放军，并且随时补充人民解放军，彻底打败侵略者。
    人民公社的一切组织，包括民兵的组织在内，都应当既有集中，又有民主。公社不但要组织人民的生产，而且要组织人民的生活。为了把工作作好，一定要实行高度的民主，一定要有事同群众商量，忠实地代表群众的利益，反映群众的意志。因此，公社必须在实行“组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化”的同时，充分地实行管理民主化。决不允许借口组织军事化，或者利用对付敌人的民兵制度，而使公社和民兵组织的民主生活受到丝毫的削弱。公社是我国基层政权的组织，只有充分保证公社的民主化，才能在全国范围内造成又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的那样一种政治局面。

    办好人民公社的根本问题是加强党的领导。只有加强党的领导，才能实行政治挂帅，才能在干部和社员中深入地进行社会主义、共产主义的思想教育和反对各种错误倾向的斗争，才能正确地执行党的路线和政策。某些人认为有了公社就可以不要党，就可以实行所谓“党社合一”，这种想法是错误的。
    党在人民公社的工作中，除了必须保证执行正确的路线和政策以外，还必须注意教育公社的工作人员发扬优良的作风，首先是群众路线的作风和实事求是的作风。
    经过一九五七年至一九五八年的整风运动，党的群众路线已经获得了新的伟大的胜利。社会主义建设的大跃进和农村人民公社的普遍建立，就是这一胜利的两个标志。党的群众路线的工作方法是人民公社的生命；没有群众路线，没有群众对党和人民政府的充分信任，没有群众的革命积极性的高涨，人民公社的建立和巩固是不可能的。因此，公社的各级领导工作人员，在任何工作中，都必须彻底执行群众路线。必须把自己看成是一个普通的劳动者，对于社员群众采取同志式的态度。严格禁止用那种压服群众的国民党作风、资产阶级作风来对待群众。由于生产的大跃进，由于公社化的胜利，某些干部开始冲昏头脑，对人民群众不愿意耐心地进行说服教育工作，而表现某种粗暴态度。这种现象虽然只是个别的，但是必须引起严重的警惕。
    党在任何工作中必须坚持革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则。一九五八年的大跃进创造了我国社会主义建设事业的空前胜利，现在甚至我们的敌人也无法否认这个胜利的意义了。但是我们决不能因为有了大的成绩就忽视小的缺点。相反，成绩愈大，我们愈需要提醒干部保持冷静的头脑，不要在一片胜利声中变得飘飘然起来，以至看不到，甚至不愿意看到，自己工作中的缺点。目前社会主义建设工作中值得注意的一种倾向是浮夸。这是同我们党的实事求是的作风不相容的，是对我们的社会主义建设事业的发展不利的。我们的经济工作必须愈作愈细致，我们的各级领导工作人员必须善于区别事物的真象和假象，区别有根据的要求和没有根据的要求，对情况的判断必须力求接近客观实际。只有这样，我们才能在确实可靠的基础上制定和实现我们的计划。

    为了促进人民公社的巩固，为了保证一九五九年工业和农业生产的更大跃进，各省、市、自治区党委应当根据本决议所提出的各项要求，抓紧一九五八年十二月至一九五九年四月的五个月时间，紧密结合冬季和春季的生产任务，对本地区人民公社进行一次教育、整顿和巩固的工作，即整社的工作。
    在进行整社的时候，首先要求领导干部认真地进行自我批评，虚心地听取群众的意见，在这个基础上，放手发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，贴大字报，表扬好人好事，批判坏思想坏作风，总结经验，明确方向，开展一个深入的社会主义、共产主义思想教育运动。
    在进行整社的时候，要对公社的生产规划、分配状况、生活福利、经营管理、财务工作、组织领导，做一次全面的深入的检查。同时，要切实整顿党的组织和公社的组织，保证党和公社的各级领导成员必须是忠实于人民利益和共产主义事业的积极分子，并且吸收在大跃进运动和公社化运动中受过考验、合乎党员标准的优秀分子入党。
    对于党员、干部作风中的问题，要经过党的教育和群众鸣放加以处理。在处理的时候，要注意保护干部和群众的积极性，要根据“团结——批评——团结”的原则和“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，对于犯了错误而又愿意改正错误的人批判从严，处理从宽。对于混入公社领导机构的阶级异己分子，和极少数作风恶劣、屡教不改的分子，应当发动群众把他们从领导机构里清除出去。
    复杂的阶级斗争，不但在国外，在资本主义世界，严重地存在着；就是在国内，也还是存在着。要教育群众提高革命警惕性，严防敌人的破坏活动。公社中过去的地主分子、富农分子、反革命分子和其他被剥夺了政治权利的人，是否可以作社员，或者作非正式社员，或者仍然由公社监督劳动，都应当在整社的过程中，由群众根据他们的表现，分别地加以讨论和做出决定。
    整社工作，在每个县的范围内，要首先做好一个或者两个试点，即在一个或者两个人民公社内，帮助那里的同志们，在一个较短的时间内，做好那里的工作，取得经验，作为榜样，然后全面推广。各省、市、自治区，都要组织千人、几千人或者万人左右的检查团，由省、地、县三级党委的第一书记挂帅，领导整社工作。检查团要在专区和专区之间、县和县之间、公社和公社之间，开展参观评比，召集现场会议，发扬成绩，克服缺点，鼓干劲，想办法，具体地解决当前的问题，及时地推广成功的经验。总之，必须通过这一次整顿，使全国的人民公社的工作普遍地提高一步。
