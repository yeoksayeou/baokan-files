Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: The Ministry of Agriculture convened a telephone conference on the 12th, requiring all localities to vigorously promote technological innovation and carry out a high-efficiency movement in water conservancy construction. At the same time, it is also necessary to seize the winter irrigation work, especially the winter irrigation of wheat fields, in order to lay the foundation for next year's bumper harvest.

    The telephone conference first listened to the experience introductions from Shandong, Hunan, Yunnan and other provinces on the implementation of large-scale blasting, the improvement of construction tools, the establishment of factories on construction sites, and winter irrigation. Then, He Jifeng, Vice Minister of Agriculture, made a speech.

    He Jifeng said that the current water conservancy construction movement is developing towards a climax. The number of workers participating in water conservancy construction in early December increased by nearly double compared to the end of November. It is estimated that the number of people participating in construction in the middle and late December will increase significantly. However, in order to complete the water conservancy construction tasks for 1959, it is still necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, rationally arrange labor, and in particular, to take vigorously promoting technological innovation and carrying out a high-efficiency movement as an important part of the current leadership of water conservancy construction. He Jifeng pointed out that in the outpost battle of the water conservancy construction movement, some areas have significantly improved construction efficiency compared with the winter and spring of last year due to vigorously promoting technological innovation. However, because the tool reform work in many areas is still in the research and pilot stage, and has not been quickly promoted and used, the average efficiency is still not high from the overall situation, and some provinces and regions are even still at the level of the winter and spring of last year. He said that this situation must be changed quickly. At present, all localities should quickly launch a mass technical innovation movement. If this central link is grasped well, not only can the efficiency be significantly improved, but the labor tension can also be fundamentally changed. He said that with advanced tools, there must also be advanced operation technology and labor organization to adapt to it, so as to play a greater role. Therefore, all localities should also organize various professional teams, divide labor and specialize, and conduct centralized leadership for coordinated operations.

    He emphasized that while vigorously promoting the high-efficiency movement, all localities should pay special attention to ensuring the quality of the project and improving the lives of the migrant workers.

    He Jifeng finally talked about the issue of winter irrigation. He demanded that all localities must further develop winter irrigation work, and especially seize the winter irrigation work of wheat fields. He pointed out that timely winter irrigation is a key to ensuring a bumper wheat harvest next year.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Setting up factories and schools on construction sites and vigorously carrying out technological reforms has become a prominent feature of farmland water conservancy construction across the country this winter.

    Party committees in various localities attach great importance to mobilizing the masses, constantly overcoming conservative ideas, and carrying out high-efficiency movements on water conservancy construction sites. After creating more than 200 kinds of advanced tools and promoting 20,278 pieces, the Yintao Project construction site in Gansu Province has eliminated the phenomenon of manual carrying and has achieved "five fasts" (fast digging, fast loading, fast transportation, fast unloading, fast filling), "three selfs" (self-loading, self-transportation, self-unloading), and "two mechanizations" (soil mechanization, ball bearingization). The average daily earthwork efficiency of more than 110,000 people on the entire construction site has reached 76 cubic meters per person, the stonework efficiency is 78 cubic meters per person, and the highest individual efficiency has reached 2,056 cubic meters. More than 4.5 million improved construction tools have been promoted on the water conservancy construction sites in Jiangsu Province, and the rope traction soil transportation method has been widely used on the river network chemical construction sites. The "creeper" soil transport vehicle created in Dingbian County, Shaanxi Province, has a carrying capacity equal to 24 small pushcarts.

    Blasting construction methods have shown great power in water conservancy construction in various places. In Linli County, Hunan Province, one blast blew up more than 40,000 cubic meters. In Wudi County, Shandong Province, the electric detonator blasting method was used to bury 60 fifty-kilogram bags of explosives in the river channel to be excavated. One blast opened a river channel that was 300 meters long, 2 to 3 meters deep, 8 meters wide at the top, and 1 to 2 meters wide at the bottom. Blasting construction is a major technological reform, and various localities are actively promoting it.

    Most areas are currently running soil explosives, cement, tools, soil niter, lime and other factories on a large scale to solve the needs of their regions or projects for water conservancy construction materials and tools. According to incomplete statistics from ten provinces and regions, including Sichuan, Guangxi, and Zhejiang, these areas have now built 31,848 explosive factories, 3,258 gunpowder factories, and 5,380 lime factories.

    革新技术开展水利高工效运动
    适时冬灌为明年丰收打下基础
    农业部召开水利电话会议
    新华社14日讯  农业部在12日召开电话会议，要求各地在兴修水利工作中大搞技术革新，开展高工效运动；同时，还要抓紧冬灌工作，特别是对麦田的冬灌，以便为明年大丰收打下基础。
    电话会议首先听取了山东、湖南、云南等省关于水利施工实行大爆破、改良施工工具、工地办工厂和冬灌等方面的经验介绍。接着，农业部副部长何基沣做了发言。
    何基沣说，当前水利兴修运动正在向高潮发展。12月上旬全国兴修水利的出工人数比11月底增加将近一倍。估计中、下旬参加施工的人数还会大量增加。但是要想完成1959年度的水利兴修任务，还必须坚持政治挂帅，合理安排劳力；特别是要把大闹技术革新开展高工效运动，作为当前领导水利施工的一个重要环节。何基沣指出，在水利兴修运动的前哨战中，有些地区由于大搞技术革新，施工工效已比去冬今春有了显著提高，但是由于不少地区的工具改革工作还停留在创造研究和试点阶段，没有迅速地推广使用，因而从总的情况看，平均工效还不高，有些省区甚至还停留在去冬今春的水平。他说，这种情况必须迅速改变。当前各地应当赶快掀起群众性的技术革新运动，这个中心环节抓好了，不仅工效能显著提高，劳力紧张的情况也能从根本上改变。他说，有了先进工具，还必须有先进的操作技术和劳动组织相适应，这样，才能发挥更大的作用。因此，各地还应当组织各种专业队，分工分业，集中领导，进行协同作战。
    他强调指出，各地在大搞高工效运动的同时，要特别注意保证工程质量，注意改善民工生活。
    何基沣最后谈到了冬灌问题。他要求各地必须把冬灌工作进一步开展起来，特别是对麦田的冬灌工作更要抓紧。他指出：适时冬灌是保证明年小麦大丰收的一个关键。
    新华社12日讯  工地自办工厂、学校，大搞技术改革，已经成为今冬全国各地农田水利建设中的突出特点。
    各地党委十分重视发动群众，不断克服保守思想，在水利工地上开展高工效运动。甘肃省引洮工程工地在创造了先进工具二百多种、推广二万零二百七十八件后，已经消灭了人背肩挑现象，实现了“五快”（快挖、快装、快运、快卸、快填）、“三自”（自装、自运、自卸）、“二化”（土机械化、滚珠轴承化）。全工地十一万多人平均每人每日土方工效已达七十六公方，石方工效七十八公方，个人工效最高达到二千零五十六公方。江苏省各水利工地上已推广改良施工工具四百五十多万件，绳索牵引运土法已经在河网化工地上广泛采用。陕西省定边县创造的爬山虎运土车，载重量等于二十四部小推车。
    爆破施工法已在各地水利施工中大显威力。湖南省临澧县一炮炸了四万多方。山东省无棣县用电流雷管爆破法，把六十个五十公斤重的炸药包埋在要开挖的河道里，一次爆破开成长三百公尺、深二至三公尺、上口宽八公尺、底宽一至二公尺的河槽。爆破施工是一项重大的技术改革，各地正在积极推广。
    大部分地区目前都在大办土炸药、水泥、工具、土硝、石灰等厂，就、地解决本地区或本工程对于水利建设器材、工具等的需要。据四川、广西、浙江等十个省、区的不完全统计，目前这些地区已经建成炸药厂三万一千八百四十八处，火药厂三千二百五十八处，石灰厂五千三百八十处。（附图片）
