    Mountainous Areas Can Also Undertake Large-Scale Farmland Gardenization
    Qin County Refines and Organizes Basic Farmland
    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, 4th dispatch) Shanxi Province's Qin County people are vigorously engaged in the construction of "basic farmland"—gardenization, actively creating conditions for the realization of a greater leap forward in agriculture next year.
    At present, the labor force invested in this activity by people's communes throughout the county has reached more than 150,000 people. While completing large-scale deep plowing, they are also leveling land, improving soil by applying fertilizer in layers, and eliminating pests and diseases. They have already transformed the old appearance of more than 52,000 mu of cultivated land, creating a new scene of deep plowing to three chi, land as flat as a mirror, dividing fields into ridges, and self-flowing irrigation. The mass movement for large-scale gardenization in the county this winter is being carried out on the basis of promoting the "basic farmland" system of planting less, yielding more, and harvesting more. The Qin County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision to vigorously promote gardenization, requiring 400,000 mu of basic farmland to be deep-plowed to three chi, raised in low-lying areas, leveled the ground, made the soil fine and loose, and provided self-flowing irrigation, universally realizing gardenization.
    After the county party committee put forward the plan for gardenization, it mobilized cadres and the masses to launch a great airing of views, great debates, clarifying whether planting less can yield more, whether one mu of gardenized land per person is feasible, and whether it can guarantee a triple harvest of deep plowing, land leveling, and manure accumulation. At the same time, the masses were also organized to visit wheat produced on gardenized land. This eliminated superstition and liberated thinking. Of the more than 150,000 laborers in the county, in addition to the more than 80,000 laborers on the four fronts of steel, water conservancy construction, etc., the remaining more than 70,000 laborers, plus all the able-bodied and auxiliary laborers, totaling 80,000 people, a total of 152,000 people have been put into the movement to vigorously promote gardenization. In the process of realizing the gardenization movement, various places generally used the form of doing model fields and holding on-site meetings to impart technology to hundreds of thousands of people. Through the red flag emulation movement, the heroic spirit of the masses in moving mountains and seas and despising difficulties has been further stimulated. Communes have also established acceptance and archival systems to ensure the specifications of gardenization.

### 山区也能大搞耕地园田化  沁县精细整理基本农田

    山区也能大搞耕地园田化
    沁县精细整理基本农田
    本报太原4日电  山西省沁县人民大搞“基本农田”建设——园田化，为实现明年农业更大跃进积极创造条件。
    目前，全县各人民公社投入此项活动的劳动大军已达十五万多人。他们在完成大面积深耕地的同时，结合平整土地、改良土壤分层施肥、消灭病虫害，已使五万二千多亩耕地改变旧面貌，出现了深翻三尺、地平如镜、划畦为垅、自流灌溉的新景象。今年冬季全县大搞园田化群众运动，是在推行少种、高产、多收“基本农田”制度的基础上开展的。中共沁县县委做出了大搞园田化的决定，要求把四十万亩基本农田做到深翻三尺、起高垫低、地面平整、土壤碎细、自流灌溉，普遍实现园田化。
    县委提出园田化的规划后，发动干部和群众展开了大鸣大放大辩论，辨明了少种能不能多收？每人一亩园田化的土地行不行？能不能保证深耕、平整土地、积肥三丰收等问题。与此同时，还组织群众参观了在园田化的土地上生产的小麦。从而破除了迷信，解放了思想。全县十五万多个劳力，除钢铁、水利建设等四条战线上的八万多个劳力外，所余七万多个劳力，并加上所有能参加劳动的劳动力和辅助劳动力八万人，共有十五万二千人都投入大搞园田化的运动中。实现园田化运动中，各地普遍用搞样板田、召开现场会议的形式，向十几万人传授技术。通过红旗竞赛运动，进一步激发了群众移山填海、藐视困难的英雄气概。各公社还建立了验收和档案制度，保证园田化规格。
