    Launch a Great Technical Revolution, Increase Logging and Speed Up Transportation
    Produce More Timber to Support National Construction
    (Our report) Heilongjiang Province's 180,000 forestry workers, who work day and night to produce timber for the country, under the leadership of the Party, have launched a massive technical revolution campaign, vigorously engaging in tool reform, improvement, and self-made equipment, realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of production. They are producing more timber to support the entire nation. This year, the province has provided 8,610,000 cubic meters of timber to the rest of the country, accounting for about one-third of the total national timber production.
    In the vast, rolling mountains of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Ranges and the Wanda Mountains of Heilongjiang Province, which stretch for thousands of miles, grow precious trees such as red pine, larch, ash, and Amur cork tree. This is our country's largest timber production base. In order to meet the urgent need for timber during this year's all-round Great Leap Forward in production, various forestry enterprises, after several revisions, have formulated a Great Leap Forward plan to produce 10,032,000 cubic meters of timber this year. This Great Leap Forward plan represents an increase of nearly double the actual completed figure for 1957, and by the end of November, 9,180,000 cubic meters had been completed. In order to ensure the completion of this Great Leap Forward plan, a technical revolution campaign was launched in the forestry areas, with everyone using their brains and hands, offering suggestions and ideas. Local experts, local methods, and local machinery have appeared everywhere, multiplying production efficiency. Meng Zhaogui, a famous chainsaw operator at the Dailing Forestry Experimental Bureau, used to cut a maximum of 142 cubic meters of timber per day. After improving his operating methods, his daily output leaped to 561 cubic meters, increasing his timber felling volume by more than three times. In some forestry areas, due to improvements in labor organization and improved bucking saw techniques, the daily felling volume has generally increased from 30-40 cubic meters in the past to over 100 cubic meters, with the highest reaching over 500 cubic meters. In the past, large amounts of timber were transported down from high mountains and steep ridges almost entirely by horses in the winter. Now, forestry workers have created more than 20 new timber collection tools, such as aerial cableways, wooden rail timber collectors, high-slope braking double-axle skids, and wooden rail chutes. The timber collection efficiency has generally increased by 30% to 40%, greatly increasing the proportion of year-round operations. Many forestry bureaus have relied on their own efforts to create wooden platform carts, equipped with internal combustion engine steam locomotives, and have basically realized the mechanization or semi-mechanization of timber transportation. Many lumberyards have created a large number of loading machinery tools, basically eliminating heavy manual labor such as carrying on shoulders, greatly improving loading efficiency.
    The Heilongjiang forestry area has also devised many methods to improve the utilization rate of timber. A large number of small timber processing factories have been established in the forestry area, using branches and broken boards and shavings to make various artificial boards, pulp, and various furniture, aviation plywood, gears, and other products needed by industry. At the same time, a large number of forest chemical factories have been established to produce large quantities of forest chemical products to supply the needs of industrial production and people's lives.
    Heilongjiang is embarking on the comprehensive development of the virgin forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains; in the already developed Lesser Khingan Mountains and Wanda Mountains, new logging areas will also be opened up. More than 20 new forestry bureaus have been established and are actively preparing for logging production.

### 大闹技术革命  多采伐快装运  生产更多木材支援国家建设

    大闹技术革命  多采伐快装运
    生产更多木材支援国家建设
    本报讯  日日夜夜为国家生产木材的黑龙江省林区十八万名职工，在党的领导下，开展了声势浩大的技术革命运动，大搞工具改革、改进和自制设备，实现生产的机械化半机械化的技术革命运动。生产出更多的木材，支援全国。今年全省支援全国的木材达八百六十一万立方公尺，占全国木材总产量三分之一左右。
    在黑龙江省绵延数千里的大、小兴安岭和完达山的丛山峻岭里，盛产名贵的红松、落叶松、水曲柳和黄菠罗等树木，这是我国最大的木材生产基地。为了适应今年全面生产大跃进对木材急剧的需要，各林业企业经过几次的修改，制订了今年生产木材一千零三万二千立方公尺的跃进计划。这个跃进计划比1957年实际完成数字增加将近一倍，到11月底已完成九百一十八万立方公尺。为着保证完成这个跃进计划，在林区开展了技术革命运动，人人动脑动手，献计献策，土专家、土办法、土机械到处出现，生产效率倍增。带岭林业实验局著名油锯手孟兆贵过去一天最多伐木一百四十二立方公尺，经过改进操作方法后，日产量跃进到五百六十一立方公尺，比过去伐木量提高了三倍多。有些林区由于改善了劳动组织和改进了弯把锯的错锯技术，日采伐量普遍由过去三、四十立方公尺提高到一百多立方公尺，最高达到五百余立方公尺。过去大量的木材从高山峻岭上集运下来，几乎全靠冬季马匹拖运，现在林业工人创造了各种架空索道、木轨集材器、高坡制动双轴滑杠、木轨滑道等二十多种集材新工具，集材效率普遍提高30％到40％，大大增加常年作业的比重。许多林业局自力更生，创造木板台车，装备内燃机蒸气机车，运材基本实现了机械化或半机械化。许多贮木场创造了大量的装车机械工具，基本上取消了人抬肩扛重体力劳动，大大地提高了装车效率。
    黑龙江林区在提高木材利用率方面也想了很多办法。在林区里建立了大批的小型木材加工厂，利用枝丫和碎板、刨花制成各种人造板、纸浆和各种家具、航空胶合板、牙轮等工业需用的产品。同时，还建立了大批的林产化学工厂，生产大量的林业化学产品，供应工业生产和人民生活的需要。
    黑龙江正着手全面开发大兴安岭原始林区；在已开发的小兴安岭和完达山区也要开辟新采伐区。目前已建立起二十多个新的林业局，正在积极准备伐木生产。
