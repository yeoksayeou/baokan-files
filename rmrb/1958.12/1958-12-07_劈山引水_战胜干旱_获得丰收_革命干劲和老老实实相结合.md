Splitting Mountains to Divert Water, Overcoming Drought, Achieving a Bumper Harvest
Combining Revolutionary Zeal with Honesty

(Dispatch from this newspaper) Yunnan's various ethnic groups, in the past year's Great Leap Forward, using the spirit of combining revolutionary zeal with honesty, have overcome droughts unseen for decades, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. Grain production has increased nearly twofold, with an average of over 1,000 catties of unprocessed grain per person. Economic crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and sugarcane have also increased by one to three times compared to last year.

Water conservancy is the lifeline of agricultural production. However, historically, the irrigation area left to Yunnan Province that could guarantee timely planting was only four million mu, accounting for only a quarter of the province's rice area. Based on this situation, while struggling against various erroneous ideas, Party committees at all levels first led the masses in launching a large-scale water conservancy construction movement. From Gaoligong Mountain to the Honghe Gorge, from the Yunling Mountains to the banks of the Nujiang River, a total of three million people in the province participated in the water conservancy battle this year. According to Yunnan's characteristics, while extensively building small-scale water conservancy projects, they also relied on the masses' own strength to build more than 300 medium-sized reservoirs, each with a storage capacity of over two million cubic meters, expanding the irrigated area to more than half of the total cultivated area. However, just as the spring plowing season arrived, most parts of the province suffered droughts unseen for decades. To overcome the drought, the people of Yunnan waged a tenacious anti-drought struggle. In the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, people braved the bitter cold of mountains over 3,000 meters above sea level, splitting mountains and quarrying rocks, and using natural water sources to open up an average of more than one mu of paddy fields per person. In Huaning County, Yuxi Prefecture, more than 700 migrant workers spent more than a month opening a canal more than 40 li long, traversing twelve precipices. In Jiangchuan, Jinning and other counties, nearly 20,000 waterwheels were installed in the areas along the lake and river, pumping water day and night to soak the fields. Many regions saw heroic deeds of reversing the river and diverting water up the mountains. The province basically achieved full planting and transplanting, without missing the season.

In the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, Party organizations at all levels played the role of fighting bastions. Last winter and this spring, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the slogan "Combining Revolutionary Zeal with Honesty" based on the specific conditions of Yunnan. Under this slogan, the vast number of cadres brought into play their extremely revolutionary enthusiasm, and went deep into the fields of communes and teams, sharing weal and woe with the masses. In the struggle of water conservancy construction, anti-drought planting and anti-drought seedling protection, they firmly established the idea that man can conquer nature. In the mid-tillage and summer hoeing, they relied on the masses of all ethnic groups to find every possible way to make up for the defects of large-scale planting too late due to the drought. This made the broad masses maintain high morale in the three decisive battles of water conservancy, drought resistance, and mid-tillage and summer hoeing.

However, in this year's agricultural leap forward, many places also had shortcomings such as insufficient concern for the lives of the masses, and not being good at regulating work and rest. There was also a tendency in some places to attach importance to agricultural production and neglect rural sideline occupations and diversified management. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is adopting the method of cadre rectification and consolidation and improvement of people's communes to educate cadres to learn to walk on two legs, both leading production and caring for the lives of the masses, to ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production.

    劈山引水  战胜干旱  获得丰收
    革命干劲和老老实实相结合
    本报讯  云南各族人民在一年来的大跃进中，以革命干劲和老老实实相结合的精神，战胜了数十年来未有的干旱，在农业生产上获得了空前的大丰收。粮食增产将近一倍，每人平均原粮达到一千斤以上。棉花、烤烟、甘蔗等经济作物，也比去年分别增长了一倍至三倍。
    水利是农业生产的生命线。但是，历史上留给云南省的灌溉面积，可以保证按时栽种的只有四百万亩，只占全省水稻面积的四分之一。根据这一情况，在与各种错误思想进行斗争的同时，各级党委首先领导群众，展开了规模宏大的兴修水利运动。从高黎贡山到红河峡谷，从云岭山脉到怒江两岸，全省今年共有三百万大军投入了水利战斗。根据云南的特点，在广泛兴修小型水利的同时，还依靠群众自己的力量，建成了三百多个中型水库，蓄水量都在二百万方以上，使灌溉面积扩大到全部耕地面积的一半以上。但是正当春耕季节，全省绝大部分地区又遭到了数十年来未有的干旱。为了战胜干旱，云南人民进行了顽强的抗旱斗争；在怒江傈僳族自治州，人们冒着拔海三千多公尺高山上的严寒，开山劈石，利用天然水源，开出了平均每人一亩以上的水田。玉溪专区的华宁县，七百多个民工在一个多月的时间内，开通全长四十多华里、翻越十二个悬崖绝壁的水渠。江川、晋宁等县，在滨湖沿江地带，安上了近二万部水车，昼夜车水泡田。许多地区都出现了使江水倒流、引水上山的英雄事迹。全省基本上作到了满栽满插，不误时令。
    在农业生产大跃进中，各级党组织都发挥了战斗堡垒的作用。去冬今春，中共云南省委就根据云南的具体情况，提出了“革命干劲与老老实实相结合”的口号。广大干部在这一口号下，发挥了极大的革命积极性，先后深入到社、队田间，与群众同甘共苦。在兴修水利、抗旱栽插和抗旱保苗斗争中，牢固地确立了人定胜天的思想。在中耕夏锄中他们又依靠各族群众想尽一切办法，弥补了由于干旱影响而大面积栽插过迟的缺陷。这就使得广大群众在水利、抗旱、中耕夏锄三个决定性战役中，始终保持了高昂的战斗情绪。
    但是在今年农业跃进的过程中，不少地方也存在着只顾生产而对群众生活关心不够，不善于调节劳逸等缺点。还有的地方存在着重视了农业生产而对农村副业和多种经营有所忽视的倾向。中共云南省委正在采取干部整风和巩固提高人民公社的办法，教育干部学会用两条腿走路，既要领导生产又要关心群众生活，以保证农业生产的更大跃进。  （陈铮）（附图片）
