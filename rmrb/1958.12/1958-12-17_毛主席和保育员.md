    Chairman Mao and the Nursery Worker
    He Guyan
    One late autumn evening, nursery worker Lan Yufang was playing games with a group of children on the large playground. Some of the children were singing, some were dancing, and they were having a great time when a small car slowly drove up. The car stopped, and a person stepped out, tall, with a kind smile on his face, wearing a silver-gray uniform, walking with a steady and powerful gait. Lan Yufang and the children found his appearance so familiar and kind. Who could it be? "Chairman Mao!" A child, recognizing him, shouted excitedly, and then all the children rushed towards Chairman Mao like a flock of small swallows. They ran, waving their little hands, and cheered, "Hello, Uncle Chairman! Hello, Uncle Chairman!"
    Chairman Mao smiled, stroked the children's heads, and said, "Hello, hello, are you all well? Are you having fun?"
    The children answered in unison with voices like silver bells, "Uncle Chairman, we are well!"
    At this moment, Lan Yufang walked over, and Chairman Mao quickly freed a hand to shake hers, asking, "Do you take care of so many children?" Lan Yufang replied, "Yes." Chairman Mao then asked, "How many children are there in total?" Lan Yufang said, "There are more than one hundred and sixty."
    Chairman Mao happily looked at the children's rosy faces and said, "You have aunts leading you to dance and sing every day, how happy you are!" Chairman Mao turned and asked Lan Yufang, "Do you also live in the kindergarten at night?" Lan Yufang said, "Yes, we live there."
    Then, Chairman Mao asked about the nursery workers' work situation and the children's diet, and Lan Yufang answered them one by one. Chairman Mao held Lan Yufang's hand, with a fatherly concern, and said, "You have worked hard, thank you!"
    Hearing Chairman Mao's words, Lan Yufang's eyes immediately filled with tears of happiness. She thought of the past, when she led the children in games during the day, and when she sat alone by the bed feeding water and food to a sick child late at night, she often overlooked the significance of her nursery work. Now, the most beloved leader of the people of the whole country was expressing his condolences and gratitude to an ordinary nursery worker. What a lofty honor this was! How could she bear it?
    Lan Yufang was so excited that her cheeks were flushed, and she didn't know what to say, only holding Chairman Mao's hand with both hands, repeatedly saying, "It's not hard, it's not hard... Thank you, Chairman..."
    The children leaned beside Chairman Mao, pulling his hand, asking this and that. Chairman Mao answered the children's questions with great interest. Later, when Chairman Mao was about to leave, the children were still reluctant to leave him, four or five children pulling his hand saying, "Uncle Chairman, don't go, play with us for a while longer." Chairman Mao bent down and said to the children kindly, "Uncle has some things to do, I'll come and play with you when I have time later..."
    Chairman Mao had already walked far away, but the children were still standing beside Lan Yufang waving to Chairman Mao, shouting in silver-bell-like voices, "Goodbye, Uncle Chairman! Goodbye, Uncle Chairman!" At this moment, Lan Yufang's thoughts were surging, constantly asking herself: "Have you done your job well, you nursery worker? ... I'm really ashamed!" She secretly made a vow: "I must do this glorious work even better than before!"

    毛主席和保育员
    和谷岩
    深秋的傍晚，保育员兰玉芳带着一群孩子在大操场上游戏。孩子们有的唱歌，有的跳舞，玩得正高兴的时候，一辆小汽车缓缓地开过来。车停下了，里边走出一个人，高高的身材，脸上带着慈祥的微笑，身穿一身银灰色的制服，走起路来，一步，一步，是那样稳健有力。兰玉芳和孩子们觉得他的身形容貌是那样熟悉而亲切。是谁呢？“毛主席！”不知是哪个孩子认了出来，兴奋得喊了一声，接着所有的孩子就像群小燕一样的向毛主席涌过去。他们一面跑一面伸着两只小手欢呼着：“主席伯伯你好！主席伯伯你好！”
    毛主席微笑着，用手抚摸着孩子们的头说：“好，好，你们都好吗？玩得好吗？”
    孩子们用银铃一样的声音一齐回答说：“主席伯伯，好——。”
    这时，兰玉芳走过来，毛主席忙腾出一只手来和她握手，问她说：“这样多小朋友都是你们带吗？”兰玉芳回答说：“是。”毛主席又问：“一共有多少孩子？”兰玉芳说：“有一百六十多个。”
    毛主席高兴地端详着孩子们红通通的小脸说：“每天有阿姨带领你们跳舞，唱歌，看你们多么幸福！”毛主席又转身问兰玉芳说：“晚上你们也在幼儿园住吗？”兰玉芳说：“在那儿住。”
    接着，毛主席又问了保育员们的工作情况和孩子们的饮食情况，兰玉芳一一作了回答。毛主席握着兰玉芳的手，带着慈父一样的关切说：“你们辛苦了，谢谢你们！”
    听了毛主席的话，兰玉芳眼里立刻涌出了幸福的泪花。她想到过去，在白天领着孩子们作游戏的时候，在深夜里一个人坐在床边给生病的孩子喂水喂饭的时候，自己往往忽略了保育工作的意义。现在，全国人民最敬爱的领袖，在向自己一个普普通通的保育员表示慰问和感谢。这是多么崇高的荣誉啊！自己怎么能担得起呢？
    兰玉芳激动得脸颊绯红，不知说什么好，只是双手握着毛主席的手，连说：“不辛苦，不辛苦……谢谢主席……”
    孩子们依在毛主席的身边，拉着他的手，问这问那。毛主席很有兴趣地回答着孩子们的问话。后来毛主席要走了，孩子们还舍不得离开他，四五个孩子拉着他的手说：“主席伯伯不走，再和我们玩一会儿。”毛主席弯下身去和蔼地对孩子们说：“伯伯还有些事情，等以后有空再来和你们玩……”
    毛主席已经走远了，孩子们还站在兰玉芳身旁向毛主席招手，用银铃一样的声音喊着：“主席伯伯再见！主席伯伯再见！”兰玉芳这时思潮奔腾起伏，不住地反问着自己：“你这个保育员，工作做好了没有？……真惭愧呀！”她暗暗立下誓言：“一定要把这个光荣的工作做得比从前更好！”
