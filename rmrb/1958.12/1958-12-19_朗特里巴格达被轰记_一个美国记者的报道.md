Editor's Note: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree's visit to Baghdad aroused strong anger among the Iraqi people, who protested his arrival with large-scale demonstrations. Rountree was extremely embarrassed. The Associated Press correspondent in Baghdad reported on the eyewitness situation at the time. We are now reprinting it with slight abridgements:

When U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Rountree arrived in Baghdad at four or five o'clock on Monday afternoon during his fact-finding trip to the Middle East, a group of young Iraqis shouted and threw a brief barrage of mud and eggs at him, and at least one large stone.

As the embassy car drove from the airport to the embassy, these projectiles, mostly mud, hit the car body. Rountree himself was not hit.

Rountree's car was hit by a stone in one place. The stone shattered, but did not break the windshield just in front of the driver's seat. The car was attacked by a rain of mud, pattering against the windows and body.

At the airport and in front of the embassy, groups of young people constantly chanted slogans, shouting in English, "Go home, Rountree!" This was the unchanging refrain. They also waved signs with the same slogan written in English.

No serious incident occurred when Rountree arrived at the airport. As the crowd surged towards the gate, Rountree's car suddenly drove away through a distant gate.

The Iraqi Airways "Viscount" aircraft carrying Rountree, which took off from Cairo, landed shortly after 13:05 Greenwich Mean Time. Long before this, thousands of people stood in front of the airport and on the roads leading to the airport. They waved or held up signs.

Across the road from the airport station, the crowd was particularly dense and their emotions were very agitated. From the moment the "Viscount" aircraft appeared in the low-hanging gray clouds, the crowd shouted excitedly.

An embassy car with flags was waiting on the tarmac inside the airport. When the plane disappeared behind the airport building, the crowd shouted together, "Go home, Rountree!" while waving or holding up signs.

The crowd surged forward, blocking the exit by overflowing the road. But at that moment, Rountree's car, flying the flag of the American minister, left from the other end of the airport and drove towards the city. Rountree first went to the Supreme Power Committee, signed the visitor's book, and then arrived at the embassy, where other shouting crowds were waiting.

When the Assistant Secretary of State's car arrived at the headquarters of the committee, most of the crowd hardly knew that they had been bypassed. But the news spread quickly, and when Rountree completed the signing ceremony and came out, tens of thousands of people had gathered next to the committee building.

At the same time, several trucks full of young people shouting slogans drove past the embassy. In addition, perhaps five hundred or so people paraded in line on one side of the wide dual carriageway opposite the embassy, chanting in unison in English, "Go home, Rountree!" with their signs.

Inside the embassy, Rountree was holding his first consultation with embassy officials, and the noise of the shouting was clearly audible in the embassy rooms.

Whether Washington likes it or not, the masses currently believe that the United States and the Said regime are one and the same.

    朗特里巴格达被轰记
    —一个美国记者的报道—
    编者按：美国助理国务卿朗特里到巴格达，引起伊拉克人民的强烈愤怒，他们以大规模的示威来抗议他的到达。朗特里弄得异常狼狈，美联社驻巴格达的记者曾把当时目击情况作了报道，现特略予删节转载如下：
    当美国助理国务卿威廉·朗特里在中东的了解情况的旅行中于星期一下午四五点钟到达巴格达的时候，一群年青的伊拉克人大喊大叫着对他抛了短短的一阵泥块、鸡蛋，至少还有一颗很大的石子。
    当大使馆的轿车从机场驶往大使馆的时候，这些投射武器，大部分是泥块，纷纷打在车身上。朗特里本人没有给打着。
    朗特里的车子在一个地方挨了一块石头。这块石头碎了，但是并没有打破就在司机座位的前头的挡风窗。这辆轿车遭到泥块雨一般的袭击辟辟拍拍地打在车窗和车身上。
    在机场上，在大使馆前，成群的青年人不断齐呼口号，用英文高叫“滚回去，朗特里！”这一个不变的老调。他们还挥舞着用英文写着同样口号的标语。
    在朗特里到达机场的时候并没有发生严重的事故，在人群拥向大门的时候，朗特里的车子突然通过一个远处的大门开走了。
    朗特里所乘的那架从开罗起飞的伊拉克航空公司“子爵式”飞机，在格林威治时间十三时零五分以后不久降落，在这以前许久，在机场前面和通往机场的各条道路上，站着几千个人。他们挥舞着或者高举着标语。
    在航空站前道路的对面，人群特别密集，他们的情绪也很激动，从这架“子爵式”飞机在低垂的灰色云层中出现起，人群便激动地呼喊起来。
    一辆悬挂旗帜的大使馆汽车等在机场内的柏油路上。当这架飞机消失在机场大楼背后的时候，群众一起高呼“滚出去，朗特里！”同时挥舞着或者把标语高举起来。
    人群向前冲去，涌过了大路把出口堵住了。但是就在那个时候，朗特里的车子挂着美国部长的旗子，从机场远处的另外一端离开了，驶往市区。朗特里先到最高权力委员会，在来宾簿上签名，然后到达使馆，那里正有大叫大嚷的其他人群等待着。
    助理国务卿的车子到达委员会总部的时候，大部分群众几乎还不知道他们已被人绕过了。但是消息传得很快，在朗特里完成了这个签名仪式出来的时候，已经有几万个人聚集在委员会大楼的旁边。
    同时有几辆卡车满满地载着高呼口号的青年开过大使馆。另外也许有五百左右的群众在大使馆对面的广阔的双行车道的一边列队游行，他们带着标语齐声用英语高呼：“滚出去，朗特里！”
    在大使馆里面，朗特里正和大使馆官员举行第一次的会商，这时，嚷叫的声音在大使馆的房间内历历可闻。
    不管华盛顿是否喜欢，到目前为止，群众的心中认为美国和赛义德政权是一回事。
