    Returning from a Visit to Friendly Nations
    You Fengqi, Head of the Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe of China

    In August of this year, the Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe of China made a special trip to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the independence of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and then visited the United Arab Republic (UAR) for a two-month performance tour. During the visits to these two countries, we lived happily in an ocean of friendship. After returning to our motherland, full of the friendship of the people of the two countries, we often recalled the care and warm reception given to us by the leaders of these two countries and the relevant departments of their governments; recalled the deep friendship and help of many friends; and recalled the warm applause and cheers of nearly 130,000 spectators who watched our song and dance troupe's performances. Whether it was in the open-air theaters of Kabul and Kandahar, in the opera houses of Cairo and Alexandria, at the Damascus International Fair, in the military region headquarters of Ismailia, or in the club of the Mahalla al-Kubra Textile Company, the enthusiastic faces of the audience, the stormy applause, and the cheers of "Long live Afghan-Chinese friendship," "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live China" made us feel that this was not only an expression of friendship, but also a force, giving us a profound and unforgettable impression.
    We are very grateful to King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan for his friendly conversation when he received the leaders of our song and dance troupe in the palace. He said: "Thank you to the Chinese government for sending an art troupe to participate in our Independence Day celebration. The visit and performance of the Chinese art troupe is beneficial to our people, and we hope that such cultural exchanges can be further developed." We are very grateful to President Nasser for his support and encouragement to our country when he received all the members of our song and dance troupe. He said: "The people of the UAR believe that the Chinese people will fully support all causes that fight for freedom and progress. The people of the UAR support the Chinese people on the Taiwan issue, which is to support truth and justice. I believe you can feel the feelings of the people of the UAR towards the Chinese people and Chinese leaders, and I hope you will convey these feelings to our Chinese friends, and please convey my respects to Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai." Indeed, during our visit to the UAR, we saw and heard with our own eyes how strongly the people of the UAR condemned the crime of American imperialism occupying our Taiwan, and how resolutely they supported our just struggle to liberate Taiwan. They have a strong hatred for imperialism and a deep affection for friends. We felt this affection everywhere, just as we felt the deep affection of the Afghan people for the Chinese people in Afghanistan.
    Recalling our time in Damascus, when we went to visit the home of Mr. Balu, the "protector" of Arab national music, an elderly musician in his seventies, he organized a grand get-together for us while still ill, so that we could take this opportunity to meet and talk with musicians in Damascus. He also personally wrote a song specifically to welcome us, which he sang on the spot at the get-together to express his warm welcome. He watched our song and dance troupe's performance three times and enthusiastically took the stage to speak, expressing his lofty friendship for the Chinese people. During the same period, when we visited the home of Mr. Qattan, the president of the Damascus Mass Newspaper, and gave a small performance for his family, Mr. Qattan was very moved and said that this was the supreme honor for him. He believes that our "Chinese art can give people a feeling of triumph, harvest, and love of work, and every program has its positive meaning, giving people education, which is precisely where Chinese art is successful." What is particularly unforgettable for us is that at the reception of the Syrian-Chinese Friendship Association, the host's hospitality and enthusiastic friendship, and the long and vivid speech supporting our liberation of Taiwan, linked our hearts together, enabling us and many friends to spend a pleasant evening in an atmosphere of friendship.
    During our days in Cairo, we first thank Mr. Haqi, the Director of the Arts Department of the Ministry of Culture and National Guidance, for his many-sided help. During the visit and performance of our song and dance troupe, he made great efforts in the arrangement of the itinerary, the preparation of the performance, as well as sightseeing and excursions. Professor Hassan Asimawi of Cairo University, who had visited our country twice, was one of our familiar friends in Cairo. He spent a lot of time and made great efforts to give us a lot of help. Ms. Zeinab, who visited our country last year, was the one we met the most in Cairo. She seemed unwilling to miss any opportunity to meet us, and every time she met us, she would say to me: "I love China the most, I like Chinese people the most." When we arrived in Cairo and left Cairo, she led her children, dressed in Chinese style, to pick us up and see us off. On the night before we were about to leave Cairo and return to our country, she and her husband, Mr. Abed, insisted on accompanying me and Comrade Wang Xin, the deputy head of our song and dance troupe, to take a night tour of Cairo in her car. It was in this touring car that we heard the broadcast of the Israeli army's harassment and attack on their northern territory. Mr. Abed, who worked in the army, said to me excitedly: "The Israeli army has opened fire on us again, I won't be able to see you off tomorrow." At that time, I said to him: "We firmly support you in defeating the invaders, and we hope to hear news of your victory on the journey."
    In other places in the UAR, such as Alexandria, Ismailia, and Mahalla al-Kubra, we were also warmly received by many friends and had many friendly conversations with them. When we talked with Mr. Ahmed, the general manager of the Mahalla al-Kubra Textile Company, about the significance of mutual support between our two countries, he believed that this was the foundation of the friendship between the people of our two countries. He believes that in the road of developing economy and culture, relying on Western imperialism is the road of colonialism, and relying on ourselves and the assistance of the Soviet Union and China is the road of freedom and independence. This is precisely the personal experience of our Chinese people for many years. We support and help each other in the common struggle against imperialism and in the cause of building our respective countries, which is not only an expression of deep friendship, but also will produce majestic strength. This strength will provide a strong guarantee for us to win the victory in the common struggle against imperialism, and will provide confidence for our respective construction cause.
    The people of the UAR and the people of Afghanistan, like them, not only love the Chinese people and have a deep friendship with the Chinese people, but also love Chinese art. They used the following comments to praise the performance of our song and dance troupe. "Beautiful movements, bright colors, noble style, special artistic miracle"; "When you see this kind of art, you will definitely love this great nation, love their life"; "They are like a picture composed of many colors, with clear lines and harmonious colors"; "They are as beautiful as the breeze, as ingenious as fairies, and as smiling as moonlight." These are just a few examples of the many headlines or comments in newspapers and magazines.
    During our visit, we learned a lot from many foreign friends. In the Women's Association in Kabul, Afghan artists enthusiastically guided and helped us learn their beautiful national dances, and helped us solve the problem of performance costumes. They specially performed a very beautiful and moving drama to entertain the Soviet art troupe and the Chinese art troupe who were visiting Kabul at that time, giving us the opportunity to observe and learn. In the UAR, in addition to learning their national dances, we also learned some of their famous songs, such as "Egypt My Mother" and "Tubbaye." All of these not only increased our knowledge, but also made us deeply feel that their national artistic traditions are worthy of pride. Therefore, whenever we performed their national music and dance, the audience was very excited, applause thunderous, and cheers never ending.
    All of this shows the deep friendship between us, and we Chinese people cherish this friendship very much. The foundation of this friendship is precisely because we have all come from the long years of suffering under the enslavement of imperialism. We have a common destiny, common feelings, and common aspirations. We believe that the trend against imperialism is irresistible. In the common struggle to defend peace and oppose imperialism, in the cause of building our respective countries, we firmly believe that we will be more united, support and help each other, and further consolidate and develop the friendship between us.
    As 1959 is approaching, I congratulate my friends on their new victories in the new year, and wish their countries prosperity and their people happiness.

    访问友邦归来
    中国天津歌舞团团长  犹凤岐
    中国天津歌舞团，在今年8月间专程前往庆祝阿富汗王国独立四十周年纪念后，又到阿联进行为期两个月的访问演出。在这两个国家的访问过程中，我们愉快地生活在友谊的海洋里。当我们满载着两国人民的友谊回到祖国之后，我们常常回忆起这两个国家的领导人和他们政府的有关部门给予我们的关怀和热情接待；回忆起许多朋友们对我们的深厚友情和帮助；回忆起观看我们歌舞团演出的将近十三万观众的热情的掌声和欢呼。无论是在喀布尔和坎大哈的露天剧场，在开罗和亚历山大的歌剧院，在大马士革的博览会，在伊士美利亚的军区司令部，以及在马哈拉·库布腊纺织公司的俱乐部里，观众们热情的面孔，暴风雨般的掌声，和“阿中友好万岁”、“毛泽东万岁”、“中国万岁”等等的欢呼声，使我们感到这不仅仅是一种友谊的表现，而且是一种力量，给予我们深刻难忘的印象。
    我们非常感谢阿富汗国王查希尔·沙阿在王宫接见我歌舞团领导人的时候友好的谈话。他说：“感谢中国政府派艺术团来参加我们的独立节纪念。中国艺术团的访问演出，好处在我们的人民这一方面，希望这样的文化交流能够进一步发展。”我们非常感谢纳赛尔总统接见我们歌舞团全体人员时，给我国的支持和鼓舞。他说：“阿联人民相信中国人民完全会支持为自由和进步事业而斗争的一切事业的。阿联人民在台湾问题上支持中国人民，就是支持真理和正义。我相信你们能感得到阿联人民对中国人民和中国领导者的感情，我希望你们把这种感情转达给中国朋友们，并请转达我对毛泽东主席、周恩来总理的敬意。”的确，我们在阿联访问的过程中，我们亲眼看到亲耳听到阿联人民是多么强烈地谴责美帝国主义霸占我们的台湾的罪行，他们又是多么坚决地支持我们解放台湾的正义斗争。他们对于帝国主义有着强烈的憎恨，对于朋友有着深厚的感情。这种感情我们到处都感觉得到，就如我们在阿富汗所感到的阿富汗人民对于中国人民的深厚感情一样。
    回忆在大马士革期间，当我们去访问阿拉伯民族音乐的“保护者”、七十多岁高龄的老音乐家巴鲁的先生的家庭的时候，他还在病中就为我们组织了一个盛大的联欢会，使我们能借此机会和大马士革的音乐工作者见面交谈。他并且亲自写了一首专为欢迎我们的歌子，在联欢会上当场演唱，以表示对我们的热烈欢迎。他看了我们歌舞团的表演三次，并且热情地自动走上舞台讲话，表达他对于中国人民的崇高友谊。在同一时期，当我们去访问大马士革群众报社社长卡唐先生的家庭并为他的家人作小型演出的时候，卡唐先生非常感动地说这是对于他的无上光荣。他认为我们“中国的艺术能给人一种凯旋、丰收、热爱工作的感觉，每一个节目都有它的积极的意义，给人以教育，这正是中国艺术成功的地方。”特别使我们难忘的是在叙中友协的招待会上，主人的盛情接待和热情友好、支援我们解放台湾的长篇生动有力的讲话，把我们的心联系在一起，使我们和许多朋友在友谊的气氛里愉快地度过一个晚上。
    在开罗的日子里，首先我们感谢文化和国家指导部文艺处处长哈基先生给予的多方帮助。在我们歌舞团访问演出过程中，无论在日程的安排上，在演出的准备工作上，以及参观游览等，他都作了很好的努力。曾经两次访问过我国的开罗大学教授哈森·阿西马威先生是我们在开罗熟悉的朋友之一，他花了不少时间和作了很大的努力，给予我们很多的帮助。曾经在去年访问过我国的泽奈卜女士，我们在开罗的日子里同她见面最多，她似乎不愿失去任何一次同我们见面的机会，每一次见面时她都对我说：“我最爱中国，我最喜欢中国人。”我们到达开罗和离开开罗的时候，她都率领着她的几个中国式打扮的孩子来接送我们。当我们即将离开开罗返国的头一天晚上，她和她的丈夫阿布德先生一定要陪同我和我们歌舞团的副团长王莘同志一起乘坐她的汽车夜游开罗。就是在这夜游的汽车里听到以色列军队向他们北部国土进行骚扰袭击的广播时，在军队里工作的阿布德先生很激动地对我说：“以色列军队又向我们开炮了，明天我不能送你了。”当时我这样对他说：“我们坚决支持你们打败侵略者，希望在旅途中听到你们胜利的消息。”
    在阿联的其他地方，如亚历山大、伊士美利亚，马哈拉·库布腊等地，我们同样受到许多朋友们的热情接待并同他们进行了多次友好的交谈。当我们同马哈拉·库布腊纺织公司总经理阿罕默德先生谈到我们两国相互支持的意义时，他认为这是我们两国人民友谊的基础。他认为在发展经济和文化的道路中，依靠西方帝国主义是殖民地的道路，依靠自己和苏联、中国的援助是自由独立的道路。这正是我们中国人民多少年来切身的经验。我们在反对帝国主义的共同斗争和建设我们各自的国家的事业中相互支持和帮助，不仅仅是一种深厚的友谊的表现，而且它将产生雄伟的力量，这种力量将为我们争取反对帝国主义共同斗争的胜利提供有力的保证，将为我们各自的建设事业提供信心。
    阿联人民和阿富汗人民一样，他们不仅热爱中国人民，同中国人民有着深厚的友谊，而且他们热爱中国的艺术。他们用下面这样一些评语来赞扬我们歌舞团的表演。“动作优美，颜色鲜艳，风格高尚，特殊艺术奇迹”；“当你看到这种艺术时，一定会喜爱这个伟大的民族，喜爱他们的生活”；“她们像许多种颜色构成的一幅线条分明，色彩调和的图画”；“她们都像和风一样的优美，像仙女一样的灵巧，像月光一样的微笑”。这些仅仅是报刊杂志的许多标题或评语中的少数几个例子。
    在我们访问的期间，我们向许多外国朋友学习了不少的东西。在喀布尔的妇女协会里，阿富汗的艺术家们非常热心地指导和帮助我们学习他们民族的优美的舞蹈，并且帮助我们解决了演出服装的问题。他们特为招待当时正在喀布尔访问的苏联艺术团和中国艺术团，演出了一场非常优美动人的话剧，给我们以观摩学习的机会。在阿联我们除了学习他们民族的舞蹈外，还学了他们的一些著名的歌子，如“埃及我的母亲”，“吐拜”等。所有这些，不仅增加了我们的知识，并且，我们深深感觉到他们民族艺术的优秀传统是值得骄傲的。因此，每当我们表演他们民族的音乐舞蹈时，观众十分欢欣鼓舞，掌声雷动，欢呼不已。
    所有这一切，都说明我们之间的深厚友谊，我们中国人民十分珍视这种友谊。这种友谊的基础，正是由于我们都是曾经在帝国主义的奴役下，从长期苦难的岁月中走过来的，我们有着共同的命运，有着共同的感情，有着共同的愿望。我们相信反对帝国主义的潮流是不可抗拒的。在保卫和平、反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，在建设我们各自的国家的事业中，深信我们将更加团结一致、相互支持和帮助，进一步巩固和发展我们之间的友谊。
    当此1959年即将来临之际，我祝贺朋友们在新的一年中取得新的胜利，祝贺他们的国家繁荣，人民幸福。
