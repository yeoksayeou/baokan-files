Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Socialist Construction Units, marking the great victories in all aspects of the agricultural socialist construction front in our country in 1958, opened in Beijing this afternoon. This conference is a celebration of victory, a praise of merit, and also a pledge of allegiance. Outstanding representatives from all fronts of agricultural socialist construction, having created great achievements in their year of hard work, are honored today in the capital to receive the Party and the state's review, celebration, and encouragement.

The conference was held in the Beijing Gymnasium. This venue, which frequently hosts gatherings of the motherland's heroic figures, once again welcomed the representatives of 500 million heroic farmers. At the top of this building, the five-star national flag and bright red flags fluttered. The entrance to the venue was decorated with long red silk ribbons. Inside the venue, eight colored silk banners adorned with ears of grain were hung high around the tall, domed structure, symbolizing this year's bumper harvest. Around the venue, brightly lit slogans read: "People's Communes will accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country," "Implement simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, simultaneous development of self-sufficiency and commodity production," "Give prominence to politics, raise awareness, do a good job in production, do a good job in life, and strive for a greater leap forward in 1959," "Promote the mass line and the style of seeking truth from facts," "A full-scale revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, completely changing the face of the entire agricultural front," "Eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, eliminate diseases, change customs, and transform the country," "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." These huge slogans were hung in particularly prominent places in the venue.

A white full-body statue of Chairman Mao Zedong stood at the top of the rostrum.

Today, Party and state leaders Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun, Deng Zihui, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Shutong attended the opening ceremony. After receiving all the members of the presidium, they entered the venue with the presidium and ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the hall resounded with sustained and stormy applause. Also invited to attend the opening ceremony were the heads of the relevant departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the government, as well as the leaders of various people's organizations.

When Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture and one of today's executive chairmen, announced the opening of the representative meeting, the band played the solemn national anthem.

Deng Zihui, Director of the Rural Affairs Department of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered the opening speech. He outlined the great achievements made on the agricultural front in our country in 1958, the achievements of the patriotic health movement, and the great victory of the realization of people's communes in rural areas. He encouraged the representatives and the broad masses of peasants throughout the country to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959 under the new situation.

Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi delivered a speech. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he extended warm congratulations to this meeting and to all the farmers and agricultural workers who have worked diligently on the agricultural front and achieved great victories. He pointed out: The achievements made in this year's great leap forward in industry and agriculture are the results of the victory of the Party's rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the results of implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the results of the unity and mutual assistance of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. He said: We must never be complacent. The tasks ahead are still arduous and heavy. 1959 is the decisive year of the three years of hard struggle, and we must strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 than this year. He said: The Central Committee of the Party believes that the comrades present here today will surely be able to work together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, and under the leadership of the great leader of the Party and the people, Comrade Mao Zedong, to continue to make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. During Comrade Shaoqi's speech, the hall resounded with enthusiastic applause.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, Kang Keqing, Vice-Chairman of the National Women's Federation, and Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also delivered congratulatory speeches to the conference. (The full text of the four congratulatory speeches is on page two)

The opening ceremony concluded with the Young Pioneers of Beijing presenting flowers to the conference. These "red scarves" were here representing 440,000 Young Pioneers in Beijing. When each of them entered the venue waving colorful silk ribbons, all the representatives stood up and applauded, and the band played lively music. A Young Pioneer read a short dedication to the conference, wishing the representatives a leap forward and another leap forward in agricultural production next year. (Attached picture)

    据新华社25日讯  标志着1958年我国农业社会主义建设战线各方面伟大胜利的全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议，今天下午在北京开幕。这个大会，是个祝捷大会，庆功大会，也是个誓师大会。来自农业社会主义建设各个战线上的优秀代表们，由于在一年来的辛勤劳动中创造出丰功伟绩，今天在首都光荣地接受党和国家对他们的检阅、庆祝和鼓励。
    大会在北京体育馆举行。这个经常成为祖国英雄人物会师的大会场，今天又一次盛装迎接着五亿英雄农民的代表。在这座大楼的顶端，飘扬着五星国旗和鲜艳的红旗，会场入口处的大门上装饰着长幅的红绸带，在会场内，八幅缀有谷穗图样的彩色绸幛高高地挂在这个高大的穹形建筑物的四周，象征着今年的大丰收。会场四周，闪闪发光的标语写着：“人民公社将加快我国社会主义建设速度”，“实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举”，“政治挂帅，提高觉悟，搞好生产，搞好生活，争取1959年更大的跃进”，“发扬群众路线和实事求是的作风”，“农林牧副渔全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌”，“除尽四害，讲求卫生，消灭疾病，移风易俗，改造国家”。“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的巨幅标语悬挂在会场上特别引人注目的地方。
    会场主席台的上端矗立着毛泽东主席的一副白色全身塑像。
