Making Way and Leaping Forward
Shanxi Rapidly Develops Light Industry While Guaranteeing Steel Production

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, December 12th) Shanxi Province is adopting methods based on small, indigenous groups, combined with both indigenous and foreign techniques, to vigorously develop light industry. This ensures that the backward light industry can adapt to the rapid development of heavy industries such as steel, achieving a double leap forward in both heavy and light industries to meet the material needs of the people.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the material and cultural lives of the people in Shanxi Province have greatly improved, leading to increased demands for supply expansion. Agricultural and sideline products have achieved unprecedented harvests, requiring urgent processing and manufacturing. However, Shanxi Province's light industry base was relatively weak. During the Great Leap Forward in local industry, especially after the entire population engaged in steel production, some people in the light industry system mistakenly believed that after the small, indigenous groups for steel production were established, labor, equipment, and raw materials would be occupied by the steel industry, making it impossible to spare manpower and resources to engage in small, indigenous groups for light industry. Therefore, some enterprises, having built factory buildings, folded their arms and waited for equipment. They said: "Wait a while. Once the steel marshal ascends the stage and the large, foreign ones are built, the situation will naturally improve."

After criticizing the above statement, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently requested all industrial departments in the province to ensure the rapid development of light industry in accordance with the needs of the new situation, while guaranteeing the steel industry. Subsequently, the light industry system also held successive on-site meetings on the textile, winemaking, ceramics, and papermaking industries, sharing the experience of Yanbei Prefecture in mobilizing the masses to use indigenous methods to produce refined starch, sugar, and alcohol while supporting steel production, enabling light industry to achieve a Great Leap Forward. They criticized the erroneous ideas of relying on large, foreign methods and waiting. They also summarized specific methods for relying primarily on small, indigenous groups to enable light industry to both make way and leap forward. Currently, the movement to develop small, indigenous groups in light industry is rapidly unfolding throughout the province. The 180 small sugar factories built by the masses have completed civil engineering, and another 195 are under construction. In the papermaking industry, in addition to the 450 small paper mills that have already been planned and are under construction, some areas have also launched a movement for communes to run paper mills and teams to produce paper pulp. All textile factories in the province and people's communes with the conditions are learning from the experience of the workers of Jinhua Textile Factory in manufacturing indigenous cloth machines using indigenous steel, producing cloth machines in large quantities. The repair workshops of the Taiyuan Textile Factory, Xinjiang Textile Factory, Jinsheng Textile Factory, and other four textile factories have all trial-produced indigenous cloth machines.

While mobilizing the masses to engage in the small, indigenous group movement, the Shanxi Provincial Light Industry leadership departments also transferred manpower and equipment to accelerate the construction of large and medium-sized factories. The three yarn factories with 150,000 spindles are striving to put them into production by early next year. The new Linfen, Jiexiu, and Taiyuan paper mills with a daily output of 30 tons were originally planned to be completed in the fourth quarter of next year, but now they are also striving to advance the schedule. The new Datong Sugar Factory with an annual output of 25,000 tons of sugar is trying to solve equipment problems, and plans to install and start production as soon as the equipment arrives.

### 让路又跃进  山西在保证钢铁生产的同时迅速发展轻工业

    让路又跃进
    山西在保证钢铁生产的同时迅速发展轻工业
    本报太原12日电  山西省采取以小土群为主，土洋结合的办法，大力发展轻工业，使落后的轻工业能够适应钢铁等重工业的迅速发展，重工业、轻工业双双跃进，以满足人民群众物质生活的需要。
    大跃进以来，山西省人民的物质，文化生活大大提高，要求扩大供应量；农副产品空前丰收。这些产品急需加工制做。但山西省轻工业基础较差，在地方工业大跃进中，特别是在全民大办钢铁工业以后，在为钢铁工业让路中，山西省轻工业系统有些人错误地认为钢铁工业搞小土群以后，劳力、设备和原料都为钢铁工业所占用，不可能再挤出人手、物力来搞轻工业的小土群了。因此，有些企业把厂房盖起来了，却袖着手等待设备。他们说：等一等，让钢铁元帅升帐了，大的洋的建起了，情况自然会好转的。
    中共山西省委批判上述说法后，最近向全省工业部门提出要求在保证钢铁工业的同时，要迅速使轻工业有相应的发展，以适应新形势的需要。接着轻工业系统也连续召开了纺织、制酒、陶瓷、造纸等工业现场会，交流了雁北专区在支援钢铁工业生产的同时，发动群众用土办法制精淀粉、制糖、制酒精，使轻工业获得大跃进的经验；批判了依靠大的洋的和等待等错误思想。并总结出依靠小土群为主，使轻工业既让路又跃进的具体办法。目前发展轻工业的小土群运动正在全省范围内迅速展开。群众办的一百八十座小型糖厂已完成了土建工程，另一百九十五座正在开工兴建；在造纸工业方面，除已经计划和筹建四百五十座小型造纸厂外，有的地区还发起了社社办纸厂、队队造纸浆运动。全省所有的纺织厂和有条件的人民公社都在学习晋华纺织厂职工用土钢制造土布机的经验，大量制造土布机，太原纺织厂、新绛纺织厂、晋生纺织厂等四个纺织厂的修理车间都已试制出土布机。
    在发动群众大搞小土群运动的同时，山西省轻工业领导部门还抽调人力、设备加速大中型工厂的建设。拥有十五万锭的三个纱厂，争取在明年初投入生产，新建日产三十吨的临汾、介休和太原三个造纸厂，原计划明年第四季度竣工，现在也争取提前，新建年产二万五千吨糖的大同糖厂，正在设法解决设备问题，计划设备一到就安装起来生产。
