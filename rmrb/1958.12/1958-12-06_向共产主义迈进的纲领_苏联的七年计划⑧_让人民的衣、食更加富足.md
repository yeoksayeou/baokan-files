    Program Towards Communism
    The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan ⑧
    Making People More Prosperous in Clothing, Food
    The Seven-Year Plan report outline proposes an inspiring task: to greatly improve people's living standards and establish abundant material welfare in the country within the next seven years.
    
    Light Industry Output to Surpass the United States
    In the next seven years, Soviet light industry will reach a level of development capable of fully guaranteeing residents' needs for textiles, clothing, shoes, and other goods. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's production of textiles, clothing, and shoes, both in terms of total output and per capita output, will approach the level of the United States.
    Due to the destruction of two wars, the Soviet Union had seen the production of many sectors of light industry and the food industry regress by decades. For example, at the end of the Great Patriotic War, the production of various textiles had regressed to the level of 1925. However, the Soviet people overcame all difficulties and, on the basis of vigorously developing heavy industry, rapidly restored and improved the level of light industry production. In recent years, especially after 1953, the Soviet Communist Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture has created conditions for the great development of light industry and the food industry. More than a year ago, the Soviet Communist Party pointed out that the Soviet Union now has the conditions to develop light industry at a greatly accelerated pace without affecting the development of heavy industry. In the past year, Soviet light industry has achieved further development. The total length of textiles produced in the Soviet Union this year is equal to the total distance traveled by the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite in eleven days and nights; if the leather shoes produced this year were lined up one after another, they could circle the Earth five times along the equator.
    In the next seven years, the total output of Soviet light industry will increase by 50%. The four categories of textiles—cotton, wool, silk, and linen—will increase from 37 meters per capita in 1958 to approximately 50 meters; leather shoes will increase from 1.8 pairs per person in 1958 to approximately 2.3 pairs. All of this will catch up with the United States. If we consider that everything produced in the Soviet Union belongs to the broad masses of working people, while in the United States it is controlled by a small number of millionaires, then the significance of the Soviet Union surpassing the United States is even greater.

    Mass Production of Synthetic Materials
    The chemical industry is the most important source of consumer goods for the people. Light and beautiful textiles can be made from natural gas. What was once a fantasy has become a reality in the Soviet Union today. Developing the chemical industry has become a focus of the Seven-Year Plan, and the development focus of the chemical industry itself is placed on the production of man-made fibers, synthetic fibers, plastics, and other synthetic materials.

    In seven years, the production of chemical fibers will increase by 2.8 to 3 times, of which the most valuable synthetic fibers will increase by 11 to 13 times. By 1965, among the planned output of 500 million meters of woolen fabrics, man-made fibers and blends of man-made fibers will account for 450 million meters; among 1.4857 billion meters of silk, the use of man-made fibers will account for 1.237 billion meters; and among 515 million pairs of leather shoes, man-made leather shoes will account for 93 million pairs.

    Developing the Food and Daily Necessities Industries
    The Soviet Union's average per capita production level of many important foods has already caught up with and surpassed the most developed capitalist countries. In the next seven years, the Soviet Union will not only expand food production and further improve the taste of food, but will also focus on nutrition, and expand the production of semi-finished products, prepared foods, and nutritional foods for children and the sick. In seven years, the production of meat products and dairy products will more than double, animal and vegetable oils will increase by 60%, and sugar will increase from 26 kilograms per capita in 1958 to approximately 44 kilograms.

    In the next seven years, the Soviet Union will extensively build bakeries, and the production of canned goods, refrigerators, washing machines, and sewing machines will increase significantly. Soviet women will be able to free themselves from heavy housework more. (Attached picture)

    向共产主义迈进的纲领
    苏联的七年计划⑧
    让人民的衣、食更加富足
    七年计划报告提纲提出了一项鼓舞人心的任务，要在未来七年内完成大大提高人民生活水平和在国内建立充裕的物质福利的前提。
    轻工业产量将超美国
    最近七年，苏联轻工业将达到能够充分保证居民在纺织品、衣服、鞋类和其他商品方面需求的高度发展水平。到七年计划末，苏联的纺织品、衣服和鞋类的生产，无论在总产量方面和按人口平均计算的产量方面，都将接近美国的水平。
    苏联由于两次战争的破坏，曾使轻工业和食品工业的许多部门的生产几乎倒退了几十年。例如，在伟大卫国战争结束时，各种纺织品的生产已后退到1925年的水平。但是苏联人民克服了一切困难，在大力发展重工业的基础上，迅速地恢复和提高了轻工业生产水平。最近几年，特别是在1953年以后，由于苏联共产党采取了大力发展农业的方针，已为轻工业和食品工业的大发展创造了条件。一年多以前，苏联共产党曾指出，苏联现在已有条件在不影响重工业发展的基础上，以大大加快的速度来发展轻工业。一年来苏联的轻工业获得了进一步的发展。今年苏联生产的纺织品的总长度，等于苏联第二颗人造卫星飞行十一昼夜所经过的全部行程；如果把今年生产的皮鞋一个接一个地排起来，可以顺赤道绕地球五圈。
    今后七年内，苏联轻工业的总产量更将增加50％。棉、毛、丝、麻四类纺织品，按人口平均计算，将由1958年的三十七公尺增加到约五十公尺；皮鞋将由1958年的每人一点八双增加到约二点三双。这都要赶上美国。如果估计到，在苏联生产出的东西都归广大劳动人民所有，而在美国则由为数极少的百万富翁所支配，那么苏联赶过美国的意义就更加重大了。
    大量生产合成材料
    化学工业是生产人民消费品的最重要的泉源。用天然煤气可以制成轻快、漂亮的纺织品。这在不久以前还是幻想，今天在苏联已成为现实。发展化学工业成了七年计划的一个重点，而化学工业本身的发展重点又放在生产人造纤维、合成纤维、塑料及其他合成材料上。
    七年内化学纤维的生产将增加二点八倍到三倍，其中最贵重的合成纤维将增加十一倍十三倍。到1965年，在计划产量达五亿公尺的毛织品中，人造纤维和人造纤维混纺的就占四亿五千万公尺；在十四亿八千五百万公尺的丝绸中，利用人造纤维的占十二亿三千七百万公尺；在五亿一千五百万双皮鞋里，人造皮革鞋将占九千三百万双。
    发展食品和日用品工业
    苏联许多重要食品按人口平均计算的生产水平，已经赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。在最近七年间，苏联不但要扩大食品产量和进一步增进食品的滋味，并将注重营养，扩大半制成品、烹饪品、儿童和患病者的营养食品的生产。七年内，肉制品、乳制品的生产将增加一倍以上，动物油和植物油将增加60％，而糖按人口平均计算将由1958年的二十六公斤增加到约四十四公斤。
    最近七年，苏联将广泛兴办面包房，罐头、冰箱、洗衣机、缝纫机都将增产很多。苏联妇女将能更多地摆脱繁重的家务劳动。（附图片）
