Hohhot Dispatch: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's health departments have conscientiously implemented the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine. To date, the ranks of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners (including Han Chinese medicine and Mongolian medicine) have expanded to more than 8,100, and all levels of hospitals and clinics now have traditional Chinese medicine doctors. In addition to actively safeguarding the health of the people of all ethnic groups, helping Western medicine doctors learn traditional Chinese medicine, and training students of traditional Chinese medicine, these practitioners have also contributed more than 3,000 ancestral secret recipes and tested prescriptions.

Han and Mongolian medicine practitioners, scattered throughout the vast rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, have played an important role in preventing and controlling brucellosis and venereal diseases, which seriously endanger the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region. In the past two years, the Han and Mongolian medical treatments for brucellosis, which have been widely promoted throughout Inner Mongolia, have achieved a cure rate of over 85%, enabling many people of all ethnic groups who had lost their ability to work to regain their health and participate in production. The Inner Mongolia Institute of Traditional Chinese and Mongolian Medicine, established in 1956, has not only actively carried out disease prevention and treatment work but has also done a great deal of collation and research on Han and Mongolian medicine. In the clinical cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine treatments have shown amazing efficacy for diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis with cavities, syringomyelia, purulent meningitis, and liver abscess. One patient with cerebral hemorrhage, after being treated by Mongolian medicine, acupuncture by Han medicine, and Western medicine nursing, is now gradually recovering.

Great efforts to establish various Han and Mongolian medicine schools to accelerate the convergence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine have also achieved many results in Inner Mongolia in recent years. Since 1956, Hohhot and Baotou have successively established on-the-job training classes for Western medicine doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine. At present, most of these Western medicine students have mastered the basic content of classical works of traditional Chinese medicine and are now learning clinical techniques of traditional Chinese medicine. In order to accelerate the training of new-type doctors who combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine, a study class was held last year for Western medicine doctors to leave their posts to study traditional Chinese medicine, organizing senior medical personnel to learn traditional Chinese medicine. In addition to having established Mongolian medicine and Han medicine departments, Inner Mongolia Medical College will have students in all grades study traditional Chinese medicine courses this year. Recently, the college has hired more than 30 traditional Chinese medicine doctors from Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin to teach at the college. In addition, more than 200 Western medicine doctors in various parts of the autonomous region have participated in correspondence courses in traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, Western medicine doctors in Baotou, after learning traditional Chinese medicine, have cured 22 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis with cavities and 8 cases of lung abscess. In addition, since 1954, the autonomous region has also successively established advanced training courses for traditional Chinese medicine teachers, advanced training courses for Mongolian medicine, research courses for traditional Chinese medicine, and correspondence courses for traditional Chinese medicine, so that more than 1,800 Han and Mongolian medicine practitioners have received advanced education. In this year's Great Leap Forward, Ulanhot and other places have successively established private traditional Chinese medicine schools. In the past three years, many Han and Mongolian medicine practitioners have also trained more than 1,380 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners by apprenticeship, of whom about 20% have now learned the treatment methods for general diseases.

Encouraged by the Party's policies on traditional Chinese medicine, many Han and Mongolian medicine practitioners in Inner Mongolia have enthusiastically contributed their ancestral secret recipes, single remedies, and tested prescriptions.

    内蒙古认真贯彻中医政策
    中医队伍不断扩大  西医离职学习中医
    本报呼和浩特电  内蒙古自治区卫生部门认真贯彻党的中医政策，到目前为止，中医（包括汉医和蒙医）队伍已扩大到八千一百多人，各级医院和诊疗所都有了中医。这些中医除积极维护各族人民的健康、帮助西医学习中医和培养中医学员外，还献出了各种祖传秘方和验方等三千多件。
    在防治严重危害自治区各族人民的布氏杆菌病和性病等方面，散布在内蒙古广大农村牧区的汉医和蒙医，起了重要作用。近两年来，内蒙古各地普遍推广的布氏杆菌病的汉、蒙医医疗法，疗效达85％以上，使各族许多丧失劳动力的群众，重新恢复了健康，参加了生产。自治区1956年成立的中蒙医研究所，不仅积极开展了疾病防治工作，还对汉族和蒙古族的医学做了许多整理和研究工作。在中西医临床合作中，对肺结核空洞症、脊髓空洞症、化脓性脑膜炎和肝脓疡等疾病中医的疗法都显示了惊人的疗效。有一个脑溢血患者，经过蒙医主治，汉医针灸和西医护理后，现在已渐康复。
    大办各种汉医和蒙医学校，以加速中西医的合流工作，几年来在内蒙古也取得了许多成效。从1956年以来，呼和浩特市和包头市都先后成立了在职西医学习中医班。目前这些西医学员大都掌握了中医经典著作的基本内容，现正学习中医的临床技术。为加速培养中西合璧的新型医生，去年又举办了西医离职学习中医班，组织高级医务人员学习中医。内蒙古医学院，除已开设了蒙医系和汉医系以外，今年各年级学生，都将学习中医课程。最近这个学院已从沈阳、长春和哈尔滨等地聘请了三十多位中医医生来院任教。此外，自治区各地还有二百多名西医参加了中医函授班学习。最近，包头市的西医，学了中医后，已治好了二十二名肺结核空洞症和八名肺脓肿患者。另外，从1954年以来，自治区还先后开办了中医师资进修班、蒙医进修班、中医研究班和中医函授班等，使一千八百多名汉医和蒙医受到进修教育。在今年的大跃进中，乌兰浩特市等地又先后建立了民办中医学校。近三年来，许多汉医和蒙医还用带徒弟的方式，培养着一千三百八十多名中医，其中20％左右的中医，现已学会了一般疾病的治疗方法。
    在党的中医政策的鼓舞下，内蒙古许多汉医和蒙医热情地献出了祖传的秘方，单方和验方等。
