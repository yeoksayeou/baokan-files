Exerting all efforts, breaking down superstitions, liberating thought, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act have played a huge role in opposing conservative thinking, boosting revolutionary drive, overcoming lagging behind the masses and reality in thought and work, mobilizing all positive factors, and promoting a great leap forward in all endeavors. This year, Beijing's work, along with the nationwide Great Leap Forward, has also achieved tremendous results. This is the result of correctly implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It is the result of our resolute struggle against mediocrities, middle-of-the-roaders, and nitpickers. This struggle is still ongoing, and in the future, we must continue to use the spirit of continuous revolution to constantly criticize various right-leaning conservative thoughts and middle-of-the-roadism, and constantly strive for greater leaps forward, to accelerate the socialist construction of our country and the construction of Beijing, the capital of our great motherland.

Based on the practical experience since the Great Leap Forward, in order to strive for continuous revolution and continuous leap forward, we must continue to wage a resolute struggle against all forms of conservative thinking, continue to promote the style of daring to think, speak, and act, and at the same time, we must advocate and promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts, which is indispensable to Marxism. That is to say, we must closely combine soaring enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, be good at discovering and grasping objective possibilities, give full play to subjective initiative in our work, mobilize all positive factors, and transform objective possibilities into reality.

In the process of deploying and completing work tasks, we can often find several different situations: One situation is that the task deployment is in line with objective conditions, and as long as we make subjective efforts, do a good job in ideological and organizational work, and take effective measures, we can complete the task or complete it well. However, under the same conditions, due to the existence of conservative thinking, insufficient drive, poor political and ideological work among the masses, or improper measures, the task cannot be completed or completed well. This should be promptly reviewed and summarized. Another situation is that the strength of the masses is underestimated, the objective difficulties are overestimated, and there is always a demand to do less and slower work, so that the task can be completed without major efforts. This is a manifestation of serious right-leaning conservative thinking and is incompatible with the Party's general line of building socialism. We should conduct serious and irreconcilable criticism and struggle against this erroneous thinking and behavior that hinders the cause of socialist construction. At the same time, in practical work, there is also a situation where, due to unfavorable objective conditions, it is impossible to complete the task even with great effort. In this case, we should analyze and study the situation and tasks accepted by our unit in a realistic manner, in the spirit of being responsible to the cause of the Party and the people, actively explain the actual situation to the higher authorities, put forward our own opinions, and request the consideration of the higher authorities. The leading departments that deploy tasks should carefully study the situation and opinions of the unit. If the situation is true, the original plan or instructions should be changed. Leading cadres should listen to opposing opinions. In the completion of work tasks, we should not only listen to opinions that guarantee the completion of the task, but also listen to opinions that cannot complete the task, and carefully study the subjective and objective conditions below. If the higher-level leaders do not carefully study the situation, do not listen to the opinions of the lower levels, and insist on pressing down; or if the lower levels do not dare to raise opinions to the higher levels and insist on carrying on, it will inevitably lead to adverse consequences of being divorced from the masses, causing undue losses to the cause of the Party and the people.

Anything that advanced units can do in places with similar conditions, other units should also be able to do. This requirement is completely correct. It can spur people to break down conservative thinking, boost revolutionary drive, and promote the rapid development of work. This requirement is put forward under certain conditions and cannot be absolutized, regardless of objective conditions, requiring all units under one's jurisdiction to do everything that others can do. This is unrealistic and therefore sometimes will not work. Because there are similar situations in the objective conditions of various departments and regions, and there are also many differences, so when deploying specific work, we must not only fully estimate the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, but also consider objective conditions, proceed from reality, adapt to the time, circumstances, and local conditions, and make specific analysis of specific people and specific environments. In view of the specific subjective and objective conditions, we should put forward advanced and practical indicators and requirements in our work. If our conditions are roughly the same as those of other units, but our work results are very different, it shows that our work is not done well and our subjective efforts are not enough, rather than the requirements put forward by the higher authorities being too high. In this case, we should educate and help them specifically. For those who have exerted all their efforts, but cannot complete the work task well due to temporary difficulties that cannot be overcome subjectively and objectively, we should not only criticize them, but should strengthen specific guidance and assistance, encourage them to continuously improve themselves, further improve their work, unite comrades, and continue to move forward.

“Others challenge, we sign up to accept the challenge: Although we later find that the conditions for accepting the challenge cannot be met, we cannot take back our words, so we have to bite the bullet and do it.” This is a recent reflection from individual grassroots leading cadres. When challenging and accepting challenges, the masses are highly enthusiastic, and the development of the movement is like a swift wind and lightning. In addition, there is a lack of experience in work, so there is no time to do a detailed and specific analysis of subjective and objective conditions. Therefore, the indicators put forward at that time inevitably have some that are too high or too low. After a period of practice by the masses, if it is found that the set indicators are very inappropriate, they can be adjusted in a realistic manner according to the actual situation. Those that are too low should be appropriately raised; those that are too high should also be appropriately lowered. “Isn't doing this pouring cold water on the masses?” This consideration is completely correct. We must never allow pouring cold water on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Whether adjusting indicators will pour cold water on the masses depends on our approach. Before adjusting (especially lowering) the original indicators, we should explain the situation, explain the reasons, mobilize the masses to conduct research and discussion, and make a decision to adjust after the vast majority of the masses agree. This will not only not pour cold water, but will also consolidate and improve the labor enthusiasm of the masses. If the conditions for challenging and accepting challenges cannot really be met, but they are still implemented as before due to personal considerations, the result will be the failure to complete the task, which will really hit the emotions of the masses.

In short, in doing any work, we must exert all our efforts, promote the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and this style of daring to think, speak, and act itself must be consistent with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. That is to say, we must combine soaring revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth. To correctly realize this combination, we must first have a firm proletarian stance, a high degree of responsibility for the cause of socialism, and unlimited concern for the interests of the broad masses, and concern for the combination of the long-term interests and current interests of the masses. At the same time, we must also believe in the masses, rely on the masses, consult with the masses in everything, and fully mobilize the masses to carry out free airing of views, debates, and big-character posters on major issues concerning the masses; leading cadres should stand among the masses, and together with the masses, carefully analyze and study the situation, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and make decisions and stipulate indicators based on the correct opinions of the majority of the masses. The plans and indicators formulated in this way must be advanced and practical and reliable, and after active efforts, they will definitely be able to be completed and over-fulfilled.

    鼓足干劲和实事求是
    万里
    破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，对于反对保守思想，鼓足革命干劲，克服思想上和工作中落后于群众，落后于实际，调动各种积极因素，促进各种工作的大跃进起了巨大的作用，今年北京市的工作随着全国的大跃进，同样取得了巨大成绩，这就是正确执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的结果，是我们对中庸主义者、中游主义者和吹毛求疵派进行了坚决斗争的结果。这个斗争现在还在继续进行，今后我们还必须继续用不断革命的精神，不断地批判各种右倾保守思想和中游主义，不断地争取更大的跃进，为加速我国的社会主义建设而奋斗，为加速我们伟大祖国的首都北京的建设奋斗。
    根据大跃进以来的实际经验，为了争取不断革命和不断跃进，我们必须继续向形形色色的保守思想作坚决的斗争，必须继续发扬敢想敢说敢干的作风，同时必须提倡和发扬马克思主义所不可缺少的实事求是的精神。这就是说，我们要把冲天的干劲和实事求是的精神紧密地结合起来，要善于发现和掌握客观的可能性，在工作中充分发挥主观能动性，调动各种积极因素，把客观的可能性变成为现实。
    在我们布置工作和完成工作任务的过程中，我们常常可以发现有若干不同的情况：一种情况是任务的布置符合于客观情况，只要我们经过主观的努力，作好思想工作和组织工作，采取有效的措施，就可以完成任务或完成得很好。但在同样条件下，由于存在着保守思想，干劲不足，对群众的政治思想工作做的不好。或措施不当，就完成不了任务，或完成得不好。这就应当及时进行检讨和总结。另一种情况是，对群众的力量估计过低，对客观困难估计过多，总要求工作要做得少些慢些，不经过重大的努力就可以完成任务。这是严重的右倾保守思想的表现，是与党的建设社会主义总路线不相容的。我们应当对这种妨害社会主义建设事业的错误思想行为进行严肃的不调和的批评和斗争。同时，在实际工作中也还有这样一种情况，由于客观条件不具备，虽经极大努力也不可能完成任务。遇到这种情况，我们就应当本着对党和人民事业负责的精神，对本单位的情况和接受的任务实事求是地加以分析研究，积极向上级说明实际情况，提出自己的意见，请求上级领导考虑。布置任务的领导部门，则应认真研究该单位的情况和意见，如情况属实，就应该改变原来的计划或指示。领导干部应当听取反面意见。在工作任务的完成上，既听取保证完成任务的意见，也要听取不能完成任务的意见，认真研究下面的主客观条件。如果上级领导者不细心研究情况，不听取下面的意见，硬压下去；或下级不敢向上级提出意见，硬干下去，必然会造成脱离群众的不良后果，使党和人民的事业受到不应有的损失。
    凡是条件相差不多的地方，先进的单位能够做到的事情，别的单位也应该做到。这种要求是完全正确的。它可以鞭策人们打破保守思想，鼓足革命干劲，促进工作的迅速开展。这种要求是在一定条件下提出的，不能把它绝对化，不管客观条件如何，凡是别人能做到的每一件事，一律要求自己所属单位都要做到。这是不现实的，因而有时就会行不通。因为各部门、各地区的客观条件存在着相似的情况，也存在着许多差异，所以在布置具体工作时，既要充分估计群众的积极性和创造性，又要考虑客观条件，从实际出发，因时因事因地制宜，对具体人具体环境作具体分析，针对具体的主客观情况，在工作上提出先进而切实的指标与要求。如果我们的条件与别的单位大体相同，而我们的工作成果却相差很多，那就说明我们的工作做得不好，主观努力不够，而不是上级提出的要求过高。遇到这种情况，就应当加以教育，具体地加以帮助。对那些虽已鼓足了干劲，但因主客观上存在着暂时不能克服的困难，因而不能很好完成工作任务的，就不要只进行批评，而应加强具体指导和帮助，鼓励他们不断提高自己，进一步改进工作，团结同志，继续前进。
    “别人挑战，我们签名应战：以后虽然发现不能实现应战条件，但说了不能不算，只有硬着头皮干”。这是最近个别基层领导干部的反映。挑战应战时，群众热情高涨，运动的发展如疾风闪电，再加工作上缺乏经验，因而对主客观条件来不及做详细具体的分析，所以当时提出的指标，难免有偏高偏低之处。经过一个时期群众的实践，如果发现所定指标十分不合适的，可以根据实际情况，实事求是地加以调整。过低的要适当提高；过高的也要适当降低。“这样做不是给群众泼冷水吗？”这种考虑是完全对的。我们绝不准许向群众的革命积极性泼冷水。调整指标，会不会给群众泼冷水，在于我们的作法。在调整（特别是降低）原定指标之前，说明情况，讲清道理，发动群众进行研究讨论，经绝大多数群众同意之后，再决定调整。这样不仅不会泼冷水，反而会巩固和提高群众的劳动热情。如果挑战应战条件确实不能实现，却碍于个人情面，仍然照旧执行，结果完不成任务，倒会真正打击群众的情绪。
    总之，我们做任何工作，都必须鼓足干劲，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，而这种敢想敢说敢干的作风本身，就必须与实事求是的精神相一致。这就是说，我们要把高涨的革命热情和求实精神结合起来。要正确地实现这种结合，首先必须具有坚定的无产阶级立场，高度地对社会主义事业的负责精神，无限关心广大群众的利益，并且关心群众的长远利益与当前利益的结合。同时，还必须相信群众，依靠群众，遇事与群众商量，有关群众的重大问题，要充分发动群众开展鸣放辩论；领导干部则应站在群众当中，与群众一起，认真分析研究情况，虚心听取群众意见，根据大多数群众的正确意见，做出决定，规定指标。这样制定出来的计划和指标，必定是先进的而又是切实可靠的，经过积极努力，一定能够完成和超额完成。
