Comrades:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, I extend my highest respect and warm congratulations to the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction and to all the delegates present.

The great leap forward in China's economic and cultural construction in 1958 began with the upsurge in agricultural production. Now, as the Chinese people are actively preparing to welcome a new and greater leap forward in 1959, representatives of advanced units on the agricultural front and in the patriotic health campaign are gathering in the capital to summarize and exchange their combat experience over the past year and to discuss and determine future work tasks. We believe that this conference will play a great role in consolidating and enriching the people's communes and in launching a larger-scale upsurge in agricultural production.

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, China's agricultural production has achieved great successes and rich experiences, which are of great historical significance. Many projects in the National Agricultural Development Program have been realized nine years ahead of schedule. Grain and cotton have both doubled compared with last year. Such a speed of development has never been seen in history. The high-yield fields planted in many places have released high-yield "satellites" one after another, allowing the Chinese people to see the brilliant prospects for agricultural development. This has encouraged the vast number of Chinese farmers to further break superstitions, liberate their minds, and find concrete ways to develop agriculture in a faster, better, and more economical way. In the face of such brilliant achievements, many "wait-and-see" people and "nitpickers" have had to admit their short-sightedness. The daring and doing of 500 million farmers and their revolutionary practice have also greatly enriched and developed agricultural science. The fallacies preached by many bourgeois scholars, such as "population surplus theory" and "law of diminishing returns," have gone bankrupt and will continue to go bankrupt completely.

The people's communes in China's rural areas have developed on the basis of the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and the rapid improvement of the Chinese people's political consciousness. Although only a few months have passed, they have already demonstrated their strong vitality, powerfully promoting the more closely integrated development of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, military affairs, and various economic activities such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; they have accelerated the speed of China's socialist construction and gradually increased the communist factors in China's rural areas. Whether it is Dulles's mad curse or the various slanders of modern revisionists, they only show their reaction and ignorance and cannot stop the course of history. The people's communes, like the rising sun, shine brightly, illuminating the victorious path of 650 million people forging ahead.

Our achievements are enormous, and they have laid a solid foundation for a greater leap forward in 1959. However, these achievements are only preliminary compared to our great goals. The Party tells us that to realize the industrialization of the people's communes in the vast rural areas, to realize the gardening of cultivation and the mechanization and electrification of the agricultural production process, to make the productive forces get higher development, to make people live a happier life, and even to realize the highest ideal of mankind—communism—this is a great and arduous task. China's current level of productive forces is still very low. To realize this great task, we must still go through a difficult journey and rely on people to engage in heroic labor. As the Party has taught us, since we are enthusiastic about the cause of communism, we must first be enthusiastic about developing our productive forces. One hundred million rural youth are the most active force in developing China's agricultural production. Countless facts in this year's great leap forward show that, whether on the construction sites of farmland capital construction, in the movement to cultivate high-yield fields, or in scientific research and experimentation, and in running collective welfare undertakings well, the vast number of rural youth have shown the valuable characteristics of daring to be a shock force and daring to create, and have made significant contributions. Under the close leadership of Party committees at all levels, according to the needs of the entire production, adopting working methods and organizational forms suitable for the characteristics of youth to give play to the youth's shock role and creative spirit is a good experience. We should continue to use this experience. Guiding and organizing the vast number of young people to do a good job in production, implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, and striving to run collective welfare undertakings well, so that young people become a shock force in agricultural socialist construction, this is always one of the most important tasks of the Communist Youth League organization, as the Party's assistant.

In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, the Party also tells us that we must continuously carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution. Young people are in a period of learning and growth, with insufficient knowledge and experience. Learning is particularly important. We must guide them to combine labor and learning, and to combine hard work and skillful work. Without grasping technical learning, without improving technical proficiency, and without striving to master advanced experience and scientific knowledge, relying solely on physical strength cannot rapidly increase labor efficiency, nor can it be sustained. The Communist Youth League organization should use its greatest strength to organize rural youth to carry out technical learning and technical innovation movements, continuously reform tools, and improve labor organization, in order to maintain vigorous labor enthusiasm and create new and higher labor productivity. In order to meet the needs of the industrialization of the people's communes, rural youth should not only gradually master basic knowledge of agronomy, forestry, and animal husbandry, but also gradually learn mechanical, chemical, and metallurgical technologies, becoming versatile workers who are both industrial and agricultural. Continuing to vigorously carry out cultural learning among young people and consolidating the achievements of literacy are still important links in our education and training of young people. Without a certain level of cultural knowledge, learning and mastering modern science and technology will inevitably be greatly limited. The achievements of literacy work this year have been great, and tens of millions of young people have already escaped illiteracy. However, eliminating illiteracy is only the first step in the cultural revolution, and of course we have no reason to be satisfied with the existing achievements. On the contrary, we should continue to organize cultural learning, consolidate the achievements of literacy, vigorously run various schools, and gradually improve the cultural level of all rural youth to the level of higher primary school, middle school, and even university, so that they can grow into new people who are both red and expert, combining physical and mental labor. When organizing rural youth to learn, we must follow the policy of combining learning with labor and production, adopting the methods of learning while doing, combining learning with application, and proceeding step by step, and establishing and adhering to regular learning systems. Young people should learn from experienced and knowledgeable adults and old people, and at the same time, they should study hard, learn, and master modern advanced science and technology. Under the leadership of the Party, young people should not only become a shock force in production, but also a vital force in the technological revolution and cultural revolution.

The Party also tells us that to build a new society, we must have people with new ideas and new styles. The rural youth of our country, who have a revolutionary tradition, have received extremely profound education and training through the rectification movement and the great leap forward in production, working selflessly, being selfless and disinterested, not fearing difficulties, uniting and helping each other, and communist spirit is generally rising. This is the most valuable spiritual wealth produced in the great leap forward. In the future, we should continue to put politics in command and make ideological work the soul of all work. Only by promoting proletarian ideas and eliminating bourgeois ideas ideologically and continuously making revolution can we guarantee continuous leaps forward in work. The representatives present here are advanced workers who have made outstanding achievements on the front of agricultural socialist construction. The communist ideological qualities, the style of daring to think and daring to act, the soaring energy, and the pragmatic spirit combined with seeking truth from facts that are embodied in you are all good examples for the youth of our country to learn from. Cultivating and educating the younger generation is the cause of the whole people. We believe that with your care and help, the youth of our country will surely achieve more sound growth.

Comrades, under the leadership of our great Party and our most beloved leader and teacher Chairman Mao, in 1959, China's industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings will surely achieve new, greater, and more comprehensive leaps forward. After three years of hard work, plus several years of effort, we will surely be able to make a fundamental change in the poor and backward face of our country. Victory will surely be ours. I wish the conference success.

    发挥农村青年的突击作用
    共青团中央书记处书记胡克实的祝词同志们：
    我代表中国共产主义青年团中央委员会，向全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议，和到会的代表同志们，致以崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺。
    1958年我国在经济建设和文化建设上的大跃进，是首先从农业生产的高潮开始的。现在，当我国人民积极准备迎接1959年的新的更大的跃进的时候，全国农业战线上和爱国卫生运动中的各先进单位的代表在首都聚会，来总结和交流一年来的战斗经验，讨论和确定今后的工作任务。我们相信，这次会议对于巩固和充实人民公社、掀起更大规模的农业生产高潮，定将起着极大的推动和指导作用。
    在党和毛主席的领导下，我国农业生产取得了巨大的成就和丰富的经验，这是有伟大的历史意义的。全国农业发展纲要的许多项目，已经提前九年实现了。粮食和棉花都比去年翻了一番。这样的发展速度是历史上从来没有过的。许多地方所种的丰产田，一个接一个地放出了高产卫星，使我国人民看到了农业发展的光辉前景。这就鼓舞了我国广大农民进一步去破除迷信，解放思想，找到了多快好省地发展农业的具体道路。在这样辉煌的成就面前，许多观潮派和秋后算账派都不得不承认自己的眼光短浅。五亿农民的敢想敢做和革命的实践，也大大丰富和发展了农业科学。许多资产阶级学者所宣扬的“人口过剩论”和“土地报酬递减论”等等邪说谬论，已经破产了，并且还要彻底破产下去。
    我国农村的人民公社，是在我国工农业生产大跃进和我国人民政治觉悟迅速提高的基础上发展起来的。虽然只有几个月的时间，它就已经显示出了自己强大的生命力，有力地促进着工农商学兵各项事业和农林牧副渔多种经济更密切地结合着向前发展；它加快了我国的社会主义建设速度，并且使共产主义的因素在我国农村中逐步增长。不管是杜勒斯的疯狂诅咒也罢，或者是现代修正主义分子的百般诬蔑也罢，都不过只是表明他们的反动和无知，都无法阻挡历史的进程。人民公社正像初升的红日一样，光芒万丈，照亮着六亿五千万人民勇往直前的胜利道路。
    我们的成绩是巨大的，它已经为1959年更大的跃进奠定了坚实的基础。但是，这些成绩同我们的伟大目标相比，还只是初步的。党告诉我们，要在广大农村实现人民公社工业化，实现耕作的园田化和农业生产过程机械化、电气化，使生产力得到更高的发展，使人民生活过得更加幸福，以至实现人类的最高理想——共产主义，这是一个伟大而艰巨的任务。我国现在的生产力发展水平还是很低的，要实现这一伟大任务，还不能不经过一段艰巨的行程，还必须依靠人们从事英勇的劳动。正像党所教导我们的那样，我们既然热心于共产主义事业，就必须首先热心于发展我们的生产力。一亿农村青年，是发展我国农业生产的一支最活跃的力量。今年大跃进中的无数事实表明，不论是在农田基本建设的工地上，在培植高额丰产的运动中，或是在科学研究试验方面，在办好集体福利事业里，广大农村青年都表现了勇于突击和敢于创造的可贵特点，做出了显著的贡献。在各级党委密切领导下，按照整个生产需要，采用适合青年特点的工作方法和组织形式，去发挥青年的突击作用和创造精神，是一个良好的经验。我们应当继续运用这个经验。引导和组织广大青年搞好生产，贯彻执行农业生产的“八字宪法”，并为办好集体生活福利事业而努力，使青年成为农业社会主义建设的突击队，这始终是作为党的助手——共青团组织的一项最重要的任务。
    为了加速建设社会主义，党还告诉我们，要不断进行技术革命和文化革命。青年正处在学习和成长的时期，知识和经验不足。学习就显得特别重要。我们要引导他们把劳动和学习结合起来。把苦干和巧干结合起来。不抓紧技术学习，不提高技术熟练程度，不努力掌握先进经验和科学知识，单拼体力，劳动效率是不能迅速提高的，也是不能持久的。共青团组织应当用最大力量去组织农村青年开展技术学习和技术革新运动，不断改革工具，改进劳动组织，才能保持旺盛的劳动热情，创造出新的更高的劳动生产率。为了适应人民公社工业化的需要，农村青年不但要逐步掌握农艺、林业和畜牧等基本知识，而且要逐步学习机械、化学和冶炼的技术，做亦工亦农的多面手。在青年中继续大力开展文化学习，巩固扫盲的成果，目前也仍然是我们教育和培养青年的重要环节之一。没有一定的文化知识，要学习和掌握现代科学技术，就不能不受到极大的限制。今年扫盲工作的成绩很大，数千万青年已经脱离了文盲状态。但是，扫除文盲仅仅是文化革命的第一步，我们当然没有理由满足于现有成绩。相反地，我们应该继续组织文化学习，巩固扫盲的成果，大力办好各种学校，把全体农村青年的文化水平逐步提高到高小、中学以至大学的水平，使他们成长为又红又专、体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的新人。在组织农村青年学习的时候，我们一定要遵循学习和劳动生产相结合的方针，采用边学边做、学用结合和循序渐进的方法，建立和坚持经常的学习制度。青年要向有经验有知识的成年和老年人学习，同时还要认真读书，学习和掌握现代先进的科学技术。在党的领导下，青年不但应当成为生产上的突击队，而且应当成为技术革命和文化革命的生力军。
    党还告诉我们，建设新社会，就要有新思想新风格的人。具有革命传统的我国农村青年，经过整风运动和生产大跃进，受到了极其深刻的教育和锻炼，忘我劳动，大公无私，不怕困难，团结互助，共产主义精神普遍高涨。这是大跃进中所产生的最可宝贵的精神财富。今后我们还应当继续政治挂帅，把思想工作做为一切工作的灵魂。只有在思想上兴无灭资，不断革命，才能保证工作上的不断跃进。各位代表同志是在农业社会主义建设战线上，做出了优异成绩的先进工作者，在你们身上所体现出来的共产主义思想品质，敢想敢干的风格，冲天干劲和实事求是相结合的作风，都是我国青年学习的好榜样。培养教育青年一代是全民的事业。我们相信，在你们的关怀和帮助下，我国青年一定会得到更健全的成长。
    同志们，在我们伟大的党和我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席的领导下，1959年我国的工业、农业和文化教育事业，一定会获得新的更大更全面的跃进，苦战三年，再加上若干年的努力，就一定能够使我国一穷二白的面貌有一个根本的改变。胜利一定是我们的。祝大会成功。
