    Same Plight, Common Struggle
    – Algerian Government Delegation Visits a Certain Infantry Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    By Our Correspondent Yuan Mu
    “Although our two countries are far apart, the same plight and the common struggle closely link the people of our two countries together.” This is what Vice Premier Peng Dehuai said at the Beijing airport on the 3rd of this month when welcoming the Algerian government delegation. Three days later, when I, as a reporter, accompanied the distinguished Algerian guests on a visit to an infantry division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai’s words, filled with comradely feelings, left an even deeper impression on my mind.
    From the very day that the envoys of the heroic people standing at the forefront of the anti-colonialist struggle set foot on our country’s soil, they expressed the hope of meeting with the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who have been through hundreds of battles. Today, as the distinguished guests braved the morning mist and drove to the garrison of a certain infantry division, hundreds of officers and soldiers gathered at the camp gate, waving countless silk flags, beating gongs and drums, and shouting slogans to warmly welcome the distinguished guests.
    In a simple reception room in the division headquarters, Major General Luo Wenfang, who accompanied the delegation, introduced Major General Zou Guohou, Deputy Commander of the Hebei Military Region, Senior Colonel Zhang Yibo, the division commander, and Senior Colonel Yang Zian, the division political commissar, to the distinguished guests. Senior Colonel Zhang Yibo gave the guests a concise introduction to the unit's situation before the visit. His simple and sincere words immediately brought the guests and hosts together:
    “Our division was formed during the People's Liberation War by the amalgamation of several guerrilla units and some regular troops. Like the Algerian National Liberation Army, our unit also grew gradually from dozens, hundreds, thousands... of people.
      “All fighters striving for national independence and liberation are the same. Our unit also started with homemade rifles and cannons. But in the countless battles against imperialist aggressors and domestic reactionaries, our division killed, wounded, and captured more than 20,000 enemies, and seized hundreds and thousands of cannons and various light weapons. In those days of fighting, we armed ourselves with the enemy’s weapons.
    “And today, we already have the strength to arm ourselves with our own weapons!”
    The distinguished guests had just watched the Chinese film "Plains Guerrillas" the night before they came here. Everything the fighting Algerian people are currently experiencing made them very familiar with every scene in the film. When they saw the scenes of Japanese aggressors killing innocent Chinese women and children, they couldn't help but point at the aggressors and curse them as "pigs" and inhumane "beasts." When they saw the guerrillas defeating the powerful enemy with unparalleled ingenuity and bravery, they couldn't help but applaud and cheer. Today, when the distinguished guests came to the garrison of the powerful People's Liberation Army, which had developed from the guerrillas of that time, they could not suppress their inner excitement from the very beginning.
    “We are very happy to see that your army, like the Algerian National Liberation Army, has grown stronger on the basis of guerrilla warfare. You have proven to be invincible in the struggle against imperialist aggressors. Your growth is a powerful bulwark against colonialism and a powerful bulwark for defending peace,” said Mahmoud Cherif, Minister of Armaments and Supplies, excitedly:
    “The Algerian National Liberation Army is going through the same path you have gone through. The armed enemies of the Western imperialists who once fought against you are now fighting against us. The Algerian people are also seizing weapons from the enemy to arm themselves.”
    Senior Colonel Yang Zian, the division political commissar, then said: “Our experience proves that as long as we persist in the struggle to the end, any imperialist enemy can be defeated. Because the enemy is waging a colonialist war of aggression, while we are waging a just war for national liberation.”
    The distinguished guests first came to the infantry regiment. Here, they visited the regimental history exhibition room, the company's club, classrooms, and cafeteria, and met with the soldiers.
    In a company's club, the distinguished guests saw the "Ten Major Military Principles of Chairman Mao" written by the soldiers themselves, framed and hung on the wall. Minister Cherif asked the regimental political commissar to tell him the content of the ten principles and explain them: "First fight the dispersed and isolated enemies, then fight the concentrated and powerful enemies," "First seize the vast rural areas, small cities, and medium-sized cities, then seize the big cities..." "Take the annihilation of the enemy's vital forces as the main goal..." Minister Cherif listened and said happily: "We have also adopted these principles in the war for national independence in Algeria and have achieved great results."
    Minister Cherif once commanded a suicide squad in Algeria and served as the commander of a war zone. Years of combat experience and his current position as Minister of Armaments and Supplies made him very familiar with the various weapons used by the troops. Today, when he visited the various light and heavy weapons equipped by the infantry division, he inquired in detail about the caliber, range, rate of fire, killing power, and many other details of these weapons. Minister Cherif held an automatic rifle in a company and said to everyone: "Our soldiers also have many automatic rifles, which are made in the United States. However, they were not given to us by the Americans, but were seized from the enemy. The United States directly supports the French colonialists with a large number of various weapons.”
    The regimental history exhibition room displays a faithful record of the entire combat experience and growth history of a regiment. Here, the regimental political commissar pointed to a photo of Han Si, the head of the cooking squad for many years, and said that this head of the cooking squad once captured a company of enemies with a carrying pole in a battle. The Algerian distinguished guests also excitedly told the people accompanying them on the visit: “A little over a week ago, our soldiers captured a 75-mm cannon from the enemy. Those soldiers were also empty-handed, even barefoot.” Minister Cherif played with the homemade rifles used when the troops were first established in this exhibition room for a long time, and said in a tone full of confidence in victory:
  “We also used similar weapons when we started fighting. Our soldiers once used shotguns to attack the enemy.” When they saw many photos of the People's Liberation Army still helping the local people with production while fighting in the past, the Algerian distinguished guests happily pointed out: "All people's revolutionary troops are the same!"
    The astonishing cleanliness of the infantry division's canteen, clinic, veterinary clinic, and bathroom aroused great interest among the distinguished guests. In the canteen, Minister Youcef Ben Khedda, Minister Mahmoud Cherif, and Director Saad Dahleb, with great concern for the Chinese soldiers, used wooden chopsticks to pick up some freshly made vegetables from the vegetable bucket and tasted them. Then, they all said loudly: "The taste is too good, we salute the cooks!" After entering the spotless veterinary clinic, Minister Cherif indignantly told people that the French colonialists wantonly burned countless villages and houses in Algeria, and they would not even let the Algerians live in such houses!
    The distinguished guests then watched the soldiers' artillery operation performance and the infantry soldiers' live ammunition shooting performance. When they took turns lying on the sights of a cannon to observe, Minister Cherif introduced Director Dahleb to everyone, saying that he used to be a student at a French military academy. Dahleb then said that was in the past. The French colonialists' own crimes of aggression forced me to embark on the road to national liberation. I am now a fighter for national independence. On the way to visit the artillery, Minister Cherif himself also told everyone that he had also participated in the war against German fascists in France during World War II. However, when the German aggressors were defeated and the Algerian people were eagerly hoping to achieve their independence, the French colonialists suddenly shot and killed 50,000 Algerians. Since then, he has become even more determined to embark on the road to national independence in Algeria. The more I accompanied the distinguished guests on the visit, the more I felt how close the people of the two countries are. Minister Khedda once said to everyone at lunch: "Your army and our army are both people's armies. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, we live among the people, just like fish in water!"
    During the five-hour visit, whenever the distinguished guests finished visiting a project, the soldiers would swarm out of the barracks and training grounds from all directions. The crowd formed a dense circle, shouting welcome slogans and saluting the heroic Algerian people. The distinguished guests were always enthusiastic and gave speeches to the soldiers three times with great excitement. Before leaving, Minister Cherif said to the commanders and fighters gathered in the square:
    “We have seen your strong power, you have enough power to resist aggression and defend the motherland. Our visit to China is an important beginning. Our friendly relations will forever unite the people of China and Algeria in a common struggle.”

    相同的遭遇  共同的斗争
    ——阿尔及利亚政府代表团参观我解放军某步兵师
    本报记者  袁木
    “尽管我们两国相距很远，但是共同的遭遇和共同的斗争却把我们两国人民紧紧地连在一起”，这是本月3日彭德怀副总理在北京机场欢迎阿尔及利亚政府代表团的时候说过的一句话。三天以后，当记者随同阿尔及利亚贵宾参观了中国人民解放军的一个步兵师的时候，彭德怀副总理那含有战友深情的话语，就在我心目中留下了更加深刻的印象。
    自从站在反殖民主义斗争最前线的英雄人民的使者们踏上我国国土的那一天，他们就提出了希望能够同身经百战的中国人民解放军的指战员们见面。今天，当贵宾们冒着晨雾驱车来到某步兵师的驻地时，几百名军官和战士齐集在军营门前，他们手执无数面绸制的彩旗，敲锣鸣鼓，高呼口号，热烈地夹道欢迎贵宾。
    在师指挥部的一间朴素的会客室里，陪同前来的罗文坊少将，分别介绍河北军区副司令员邹国厚少将、师长张一波大校和师政治委员杨子安大校同贵宾们相见。张一波大校在参观前把部队情况给贵宾作着扼要的介绍。他那朴质的语言，一开始就把宾主双方的感情紧紧地联系在一起：
    “我们这个师是在人民解放战争中由几支游击部队和一部分正规部队联合编制起来的。同阿尔及利亚的民族解放军一样，我们的部队也是由几十人、几百人、几千人……而逐渐成长壮大起来的。
      “一切争取民族独立解放的战士们都是一样，我们的部队开始时使用的也都是土枪、土炮，但在同帝国主义侵略者和国内反动派作战的无数次战役中，我们这个师却毙伤和俘虏了敌人两万多人，缴获了成百成千的大炮和各种轻武器，在过去那些战斗的日子里，用敌人的武器武装了自己。
    “而今天，我们已经有力量用自己的武器来武装自己了！”
    贵宾们在来到这里的头一天晚上刚刚观看了中国电影“平原游击队”。战斗着的阿尔及利亚人民目前正在经历着的一切，使得他们对电影中的每一个镜头都非常熟悉。他们看到当年日本侵略者残杀中国无辜妇女和儿童的镜头时，忍不住指着侵略者高声咒骂他们是“猪猡”，是灭绝人性的“畜牲”。看到游击队以无比的机智和勇敢战胜强大的敌人时，他们又不由得鼓掌欢呼。今天，贵宾们来到由当年的游击队发展起来的强大人民解放军的驻地时，他们一开始就抑制不住内心的激动。
    “我们很高兴看到你们的军队是同阿尔及利亚民族解放军一样在游击队的基础上壮大起来的。你们在同帝国主义侵略者的斗争中已经证明是不可战胜的。你们的壮大是反对殖民主义的强大壁垒，是保卫和平的强大壁垒”，军备和供应部长马哈茂德·谢里夫兴奋地说：
    “阿尔及利亚民族解放军正经历着你们经历过的路程。曾经同你们作过战的那些西方帝国主义的武装敌人，现在正同我们作战，阿尔及利亚人民也在从敌人手里夺取武器，武装自己。”
    师政治委员杨子安大校紧接着说：“我们的经验证明，只要坚持斗争到底，任何帝国主义敌人都可以被战胜。因为敌人进行的是殖民主义的侵略战争，而我们进行的是争取民族解放的正义战争。”
    贵宾们首先来到了步兵团。他们在这里参观了团史陈列室、连队的俱乐部、教室和食堂，同战士们见了面。
    在一个连队的俱乐部里，贵宾们看到战士们自己书写的“毛主席的十大军事原则”，镶着镜框挂在墙上。谢里夫部长要求团政治委员告诉他十大原则的内容并且作些解释：“先打分散孤立之敌人，后打集中强大之敌人”“先夺取广大农村、小城市和中等城市，后夺取大城市……”“以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标……”谢里夫部长听了以后高兴地说：“我们在阿尔及利亚争取民族独立的战争中也采用了这些原则，并且取得了很大的效果。”
    谢里夫部长在阿尔及利亚曾经指挥过一个敢死队，担任过战区的司令。多年的战斗生活和他现在所担任的军备和供应部长的职务，使得他对部队使用的各种武器都非常熟悉，他今天在参观步兵师所装备的各种轻重武器时，曾经详细地问到这些武器的口径、射程、射速、杀伤能力和其他许多细节。谢里夫部长在一个连队里握着一支自动步枪对大家说：“我们的战士也有许多自动步枪，那是美国制造的。但是，那不是美国人送给我们的，而是我们从敌人手里夺过来的。美国用大量的各种武器直接支持了法国殖民者。”
    团史陈列室陈列着一个团的整个战斗经历和成长历史的忠实纪录。在这里，团政治委员指着多年的炊事班长韩四的一张照片说，这位炊事班长在一次战斗中曾经用一根扁担俘虏过敌人的一个连。阿尔及利亚贵宾也兴奋地告诉陪同参观的人们：“在一个多星期以前，我们的战士缴获了敌人的一门七十五公厘的大炮。那些战士也都是赤手空拳，甚至光着脚板。”谢里夫部长在这个陈列室里久久地把玩着部队开始建立时使用过的土枪，并且以充满胜利信心的语调说：
  “我们开始战斗时也使用过类似这样的武器。我们的战士曾经用猎枪打击过敌人。”当他们看到人民解放军在过去的战争时期仍然一面战斗一面帮助当地人民生产的许多照片时，阿尔及利亚贵宾高兴地指出：“所有人民的革命部队都是一样！”
    步兵师的食堂、卫生所、兽医室和浴室等地方的惊人清洁，引起了贵宾们的极大兴趣。在食堂里，优素福·本·赫达部长、马哈茂德·谢里夫部长和沙阿德·达列伯主任，都带着对中国战士十分关怀的感情，用木筷子从菜桶夹起一些刚做好的蔬菜，尝一尝它们的味道。然后，他们一齐高声地说：“味道太好了，我们向炊事员们致意！”走进一尘不染的兽医室以后，谢里夫部长愤慨地告诉人们，法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚肆意焚毁无数的村庄和房屋，就连这样的房子他们也不让阿尔及利亚人住！
    贵宾们接着还参观了战士的操炮表演和步兵战士的实弹射击表演。当他们轮流伏在一门大炮的瞄准器上观测的时候，谢里夫部长给大家介绍达列伯主任说，他过去是法国的一个军官学校的学生。达列伯紧接着说，但是，那是过去的事情了，法国殖民者自己的侵略罪行逼迫我走上了争取民族解放的道路，我现在已经是争取民族独立的战士了。而在前往参观炮兵的路上，谢里夫部长自己也告诉大家，他在第二次世界大战中也在法国参加过反对德国法西斯的战争，但当德国侵略者被击败，阿尔及利亚人民正在热望自己能够取得独立的时候，法国殖民者却一下子枪杀了五万阿尔及利亚人，从此，他自己也更加坚定地走上了争取阿尔及利亚民族独立的道路。记者越是随同贵宾们一起参观，越是感到两国人民是多么的接近。赫达部长在吃午饭的时候曾经对大家说：“你们和我们的军队都是人民的军队，正像毛泽东主席所指出过的，我们生活在人民之中，就好像如鱼得水！”
    在五个多小时的参观中，每当贵宾们参观完一项目时，战士们都从四面八方的营房和操场上蜂拥出来，人群围成了密密麻麻的圆圈，高呼欢迎口号，向英雄的阿尔及利亚人民致意。贵宾们始终热情洋溢，曾经极其兴奋地三次对战士们发表讲话。临别时，谢里夫部长对聚集在广场上的指战员们说：
    “我们看到了你们的强大力量，你们有着足够的力量抵御侵略，保卫祖国。我们对中国的访问是一个重要的开端，我们之间的友好联系，将永远地使中阿两国人民在共同斗争中团结在一起。”
