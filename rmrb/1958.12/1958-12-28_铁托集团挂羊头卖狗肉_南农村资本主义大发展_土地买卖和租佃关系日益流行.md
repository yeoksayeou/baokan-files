Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, December 27th. According to a recent disclosure in the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba," the buying and selling of land and tenancy relations are rapidly developing in the Yugoslav countryside, thus exposing the truth that the Tito leadership group is trying to cover up the increasing development of capitalism in the Yugoslav countryside.

    "Borba" stated that in the Yugoslav countryside, "most of the land buyers are individual farmers who own draft animals and have five to ten jutros (one jutro equals half a hectare) of cultivated land, or those who have financial security and can maintain their lives on land rent." The newspaper cited an example, saying that the number of people buying land is increasing in the Bajmok district. According to statistics, from last year to the first half of this year, the district people's committee has registered more than 720 land sale contracts. Individual "wealthy farmers" have purchased nearly 1,000 jutros of cultivated land.

    "Borba" also said that land buyers include not only individual farmers but also "cooperatives." For example, cooperatives in the Slavonia region have long been considering the issue of "purchasing land" because "land there is very cheap" and many people "are selling land." The Osijek county cooperative "bought about 500 jutros of land in less than a year." The Dali region cooperative "bought about 300 jutros of land." "Borba" said that there is still much land waiting to be sold in Dali and Salvaš villages.

    When reporting on land sales in the countryside, "Borba" is unwilling to talk about the real reasons why farmers sell their land. The newspaper deliberately avoids the serious class polarization in the Yugoslav countryside today, and attributes the sale of land by many people to: "Some people have found employment in the industrial sector;" "The children of others have gone to the city, and there is too much land at home;" "Some people are too old to farm;" and so on.

    Currently, tenancy relationships are also developing in the Yugoslav countryside. According to "Borba," in Bajmok, 5,000 jutros of land are rented out every year. Of this, 700 jutros are rented to cooperatives, and 4,000 jutros are rented to private individuals. Last year, cooperatives obtained more than 4 million dinars in net profit from the 700 jutros of land they rented.

    In order to obtain more net profit, the "socialist" cooperatives boasted of by the Tito leadership group have also put forward a request to extend the land lease term this year. They demand that "the lease term should be at least five years (previously three years), otherwise they will not rent the land." Extending the lease term means that cooperatives may be able to obtain more profit from the same piece of land.

    Naturally, cooperatives are not satisfied with simply renting land. The leader of the Bajmok cooperative said that as long as "a few years pass, we can use the profits to buy all the land we rent."

    As a result of the increasing capitalist development in the Yugoslav countryside, more and more farmers are going bankrupt and have to live by doing odd jobs. According to "Borba" on November 10th, "Recently, many corn piles can be seen along the railway line in Vojvodina, next to small sheds covered with grass and corn stalks, where hundreds of thousands of 'temporary residents' live. Most of them come from Bosnia-Herzegovina. They receive payment in kind for helping to harvest corn in Vojvodina."

    南农村资本主义大发展
    土地买卖和租佃关系日益流行
    新华社贝尔格莱德27日电  据南斯拉夫“战斗报”最近透露，土地的买卖和租佃关系正在南斯拉夫农村中迅速发展，从而暴露了南共领导集团力图掩盖南斯拉夫农村中日益发展着的资本主义的这一真象。
      “战斗报”说，在南斯拉夫农村中，“买地者多是拥有马拉农具和耕地在五至十尤特罗（每尤特罗等于半公顷）的个体农民，或者是那些生活上有保障，以及靠地租足以维持生活的人”。这家报纸举例说，在巴伊莫克区，购买土地的人越来越多。据统计，从去年到今年前半年止，该区人民委员会先后登记了七百二十起以上的土地买卖契约。个体的“富裕农民”共购买了将近一千尤特罗耕地。
      “战斗报”还说，买地者不仅有个体农民，而且还有“合作社”。例如，斯拉沃尼亚地区的合作社，长期以来都在考虑“购买土地”问题，因为“那里的土地很便宜”，许多人“都在出卖土地”。奥西耶克县的合作社“不到一年就买了约五百尤特罗土地”。达利地区的合作社“买了约三百尤特罗土地。”“战斗报”说，目前在达利和萨尔瓦斯村还有许多土地等待出售。
      “战斗报”在报道农村中土地买卖的情况时不愿谈出农民出卖土地的真实原因，报纸故意回避今天南斯拉夫农村中严重的阶级分化，而把许多人出卖土地归结为：“有些人在工业部门就了业；”“另一些人的孩子进了城，家里土地过多；”“也有些人因年老不能耕种”；等等。
    目前，南斯拉夫农村中的租佃关系也在发展。据“战斗报”说，在巴伊莫克，每年都有五千尤特罗土地要出租。这些土地租给合作社的有七百尤特罗，租给私人的有四千尤特罗。去年合作社在租种的七百尤特罗土地上就获得了四百万第纳尔以上的纯利。
    为了获取更多的纯利，南共领导集团吹嘘的“社会主义”的合作社今年还提出了延长土地租期的要求。它们要求“租期最短应为五年（过去为三年），否则就不租种。”延长租期，这就意味着合作社有可能在同一块土地上获得更多的利润。
    自然，合作社并不以租种土地为满足。巴伊莫克合作社的领导人就说：只要“几年的光景，我们用利润，就能把租种的全部土地购买了”。
    南斯拉夫农村中资本主义日益发展的结果，使愈来愈多的农民破产，不得不靠作短工过活。据11月10日的“战斗报”说：“最近可以在伏伊伏丁那铁路沿线看到许多玉米堆，旁边还有用草和玉米秆盖的小棚子，这里住着成千上万的‘临时居民’。他们大部分来自波斯尼亚——黑塞哥维那。他们在伏伊伏丁那帮助收获玉米后获得了实物‘报酬’。”
