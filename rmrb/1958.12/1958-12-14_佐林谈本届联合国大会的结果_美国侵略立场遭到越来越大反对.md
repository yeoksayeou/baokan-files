Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 13th: The head of the Soviet delegation to the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Zorin, held a press conference yesterday to issue a statement on the results of this session of the General Assembly.

The Soviet representative said that this session was convened under very tense international circumstances. Therefore, people of all countries expect the United Nations to make its best efforts to prevent the world from heading towards the "brink of war," to stop the arms race, and to ensure peaceful and equal cooperation between countries.

Zorin said that due to the active actions of the peace-loving forces in the world and the pressure of public opinion on the U.S. and British authorities during the meeting, the interventionist troops of the two countries had to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan in November this year and return to their old homes. Their withdrawal undoubtedly helped to ease the tense situation in the Middle East and Near East.

However, the United States continues to carry out aggressive activities against the People's Republic of China in the Far East, maintaining a source of tension in the Far East that threatens world peace.

Zorin pointed out that the general discussion at the General Assembly clearly showed that the people of all countries in the world condemn the U.S.'s policy of aggression against the great People's China.

The Soviet Union put forward a broad plan at the General Assembly on the issue of disarmament and preventing a new war. However, the United States obstructed the United Nations from adopting these proposals because powerful groups in that country are making fortunes from the arms race. In this way, the U.S. delegation had to expose its true intentions. Now, everyone can see clearly that the U.S. ruling groups do not want to fundamentally abandon the testing of atomic weapons. In addition, the Soviet Union also put forward a proposal to reduce the military budgets of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France by 10% to 15% and to use part of the savings to help underdeveloped countries. However, due to U.S. obstruction, this proposal did not achieve positive results either.

However, the entire situation of the discussion and voting on the disarmament issue shows that the U.S.'s aggressive stance is facing increasing opposition in the United Nations, and more and more countries hope to strive for a positive resolution to the disarmament issue that has matured.

Zorin said that the United Nations General Assembly finally took a positive step in discussing the issue of disarmament, which is the adoption of a resolution to establish a disarmament committee composed of all members of the United Nations. The Soviet Union insisted on this, while the United States, Britain, and France tried every means to obstruct it.

Zorin also said that the United States wanted to forcibly pass a resolution to establish so-called "United Nations Armed Forces." However, this attempt failed. This is undoubtedly a positive achievement of the United Nations General Assembly's work.

Regarding the issue of the peaceful use of outer space, the United States and some other Western countries opposed the proposal to prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes. This proves that they intend to continue to implement the policy of establishing and expanding military bases on foreign territories in the future.

The discussion of the Korean issue also demonstrated the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s policy of coercion. However, due to the policy implemented by the United States, the Korean issue has fallen into a stalemate, which inevitably leads to greater tension in the Far East and makes the unification of Korea more difficult and more complicated.

Zorin said that the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly also discussed some issues that, to varying degrees, relate to the oppressed nations' struggle to overthrow colonial oppression and strive for liberation. The United States, Britain, France, and other countries that implement colonialist policies were isolated in the discussion of such issues, which is an important result of the discussion.

The United Nations General Assembly, based on the suggestions of Czechoslovakia and other countries, unanimously adopted a resolution on the need for all countries to earnestly adopt the principles of peaceful coexistence. This also expresses the desire of the people of all countries to eliminate hostility and distrust from international relations. If the United States and other countries sincerely abide by the resolutions passed last year and this year on this issue and implement a policy of cooperation and good neighborliness between countries, it will only be beneficial to themselves and beneficial to all mankind.

Zorin pointed out that the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly once again reflected two opposing approaches in international policy: one is the approach of peaceful coexistence, good neighborliness, and equal international cooperation pursued by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries; the other is the approach pursued by the United States and its military allies, which sharpens the international situation, engages in an arms race, suppresses national liberation movements, and supports regimes that have lost the trust of their own people.

The results of this session of the United Nations General Assembly prove that the United States still has not abandoned this bad approach. It continues to use some countries that rely on it politically and economically to manipulate the voting machine and forcibly pass some proposals that suit its wishes in the United Nations. The results of this session prove that this policy is encountering increasing opposition from countries large and small around the world, especially small countries.

Zorin concluded by saying that the Soviet Union is sincerely loyal to the cause of peace. Whether within or outside the United Nations, it will continue to strive to ease international tensions, stop the arms race, peacefully resolve outstanding issues, and develop equal international cooperation.

    佐林谈本届联合国大会的结果
    美国侵略立场遭到越来越大反对
    新华社13日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：参加联合国大会第十三届会议的苏联代表团团长佐林昨天在记者招待会上就本届联合国大会的结果发表声明。
    苏联代表说，这届会议是在国际局势非常紧张的情况下召开的。因此各国人民都期望联合国能尽最大的努力来制止使世界走向“战争边缘”，来停止军备竞赛和保证各国之间和平和平等的合作。
    佐林说，由于世界上爱好和平力量的积极行动以及在会议期间美、英当局受到的舆论压力，两国的干涉军才不得不在今年11月撤离黎巴嫩和约旦，而滚回老家去。他们的撤退无疑有助于缓和中近东的紧张局势。
    但是，美国还继续在远东对中华人民共和国进行侵略活动，保持着威胁世界和平的远东紧张局势的策源地。
    佐林指出，大会讨论总的情况清楚地表明，世界各国人民都谴责美国对伟大的人民中国的侵略政策。
    苏联在大会上提出了关于裁军和防止新战争问题的广泛计划。但是美国阻挠联合国通过这些建议。因为这个国家的有势力的集团是靠军备竞赛发财致富的。这样，美国代表团就不得不暴露了自己真正的意图。现在，大家都看清了：美国统治集团并不想根本放弃试验原子武器。此外，苏联还提出了一个提案，建议削减苏、美、英、法军事预算的10％至15％，并且把节省下来的资金的一部分用来帮助不发达国家。但是，由于美国的阻挠，这个建议也没有得到积极的结果。
    然而，裁军问题的讨论和表决的整个情况表明：美国的侵略立场在联合国越来越遭到反对，越来越多的国家都希望争取积极解决已经成熟了的裁军问题。
    佐林说，联合国大会在讨论裁军问题上总算采取了一个积极的步骤，这就是通过了一项成立由联合国所有会员国组成的裁军委员会的决议，苏联是坚持主张这样做的，而美国、英国和法国则千方百计地从中阻挠。
    佐林还说，美国想强行通过成立所谓“联合国武装部队”的决议。但是，这个企图遭到了失败。这毫无疑问是联合国大会工作的一个积极成就。
    关于和平利用宇宙空间的问题，美国和其他一些西方国家反对禁止宇宙空间用于军事目的的建议。这也就证明，它们今后还打算继续实行在外国领土上建立和扩充军事基地的政策。
    朝鲜问题的讨论情况也表明了美国强迫命令政策的破产。然而，由于美国所实行的政策，朝鲜问题陷入了僵局，这不可避免的引起远东局势的更加紧张，使统一朝鲜更为困难和更为复杂。
    佐林说，联合国大会第十三届会议还讨论了在不同程度上关系着被压迫民族争取推翻殖民主义压迫、争取解放的一些问题。美国、英国、法国以及执行殖民主义政策的其他国家在讨论这类问题时都陷于孤立，这是讨论的一个重要结果。
    联合国大会根据捷克斯洛伐克等国的建议，一致通过了一项关于各国应切实采纳和平共处原则的决议，这也表达了各国人民要求从国际关系中排除敌视和不信任的愿望。如果美国和其他国家真心诚意地遵照去年和现在就这一问题通过的决议，在各国之间实行合作和睦邻政策，这对它们自己只会有好处，对全人类也有好处。
    佐林指出，联合国大会第十三届会议上再次反映出国际政策中两种针锋相对的方针：一种是苏联和其他爱好和平的国家所执行的和平共处、睦邻和平等的国际合作的方针；另一种是美国和它的军事盟国所执行的方针，这种方针使国际局势尖锐化，进行军备竞赛，压制民族解放运动并且支持那些已丧失本国人民信任的政权。
    联合国大会这届会议的结果证明美国仍旧没有抛弃这种恶劣的方针，它利用一些在政治上和经济上依靠它的国家继续玩弄表决机器的手段，在联合国强行通过合它的心意的一些提案。这届会议的结果证明，这种政策碰到了全世界大大小小的国家、尤其是小国的越来越大的反对。
    佐林最后说，苏联真诚地忠于和平事业，无论在联合国内或联合国外，它仍将努力于缓和国际紧张局势，停止扩充军备，和平解决悬而未决的问题，并且发展平等的国际合作。
