Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, December 11th. The Sanmenxia Dam project has been fully completed, and the focus of the project has shifted from the left bank to the hydroelectric station section on the right bank of the dam.

At 8:00 AM on December 9th, when the flow rate at Sanmenxia was 960 cubic meters per second, the two steel gate valves of the Guimen diversion channel began to be lowered, and the lowering was completed at 2:00 PM. From then on, the main stream of the entire Yellow River flowed downstream through the twelve comb-tooth bottom holes of the left bank spillway dam. The Yellow River has entered a new historical period—flowing obediently into a new channel controlled by the people.

The maximum flow velocity before the closure of the Guimen diversion channel was 4.94 meters per second; the head difference before and after the closure increased from 0.89 meters to 5.19 meters. However, the gate closure proceeded smoothly.

After the diversion, the focus of the Sanmenxia project began to shift. The upper transverse cofferdam of the second phase of the project being built on the Shenmen River is now about 60 meters wide, and its height is only one meter away from covering Guimen Island. The lower transverse cofferdam has been connected from the right bank to the Dijin stone standing in the rapids, and has extended outwards from the Dijin stone by ten meters. The upper and lower transverse cofferdams, and the powerful waterproof line connecting Shenmen Island and Zhanggong Island downstream, which was built before June of this year, form the construction pit for the second phase of the project. After the upper and lower transverse cofferdams are completed, the water inside the cofferdam will be pumped out, the weathered rocks inside will be excavated, and the dam will begin to be poured.

### 三门峡截流工程大功告成  滚滚黄水乖乖东流

    三门峡截流工程大功告成
    滚滚黄水乖乖东流
    新华社三门峡11日电  三门峡截流工程已全部结束，工程重点开始由左岸转到右岸大坝的水电站部分。
    9日上午八时，当三门峡的流量为九百六十秒公方的时候，鬼门泄流道的两座钢板闸门开始下放，到下午二时下放完毕。整条黄河的主流，从此由左岸溢流坝的十二个梳齿底孔流向了下游。黄河开始了新的历史时期——驯服地流进了为人们所控制的新河道。
    鬼门泄流道关闸前的最大流速是四点九四秒公尺；关闸前后落差由零点八九公尺增加到五点一九公尺。可是关闸进行情况良好。
    截流以后，三门峡工程的重点开始转移。现在在神门河上堆筑的第二期工程的上横围堰，已经宽达六十公尺左右，高度只差一公尺就能盖住鬼门岛。下横围堰已经从右岸连接到屹立在激流中的砥砫石，并且从砥砫向外伸展了十公尺。上横、下横围堰和今年6月以前修筑起来的连接着神门岛和下游张公岛的强大的防水线，形成了第二期工程的施工基坑。等到上下横围堰完成以后，就要把围堰里面的河水抽干，挖掉里面风化了的岩石，开始浇筑大坝。
