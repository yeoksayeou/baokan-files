A Struggle to Drown the Competitor
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

As the "Common Market" of six countries including France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg is about to be established on January 1st of next year, the quarrel among the seventeen member countries of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" over the so-called "free trade" issue is becoming increasingly fierce. The "Six Countries," with France taking the lead, insist on a protectionist "Common Market" plan and oppose the "free trade area" plan proposed by the United Kingdom. The French government has publicly declared that establishing such a "free trade area" is impossible. The remaining eleven countries, led by the United Kingdom, believe that the "Common Market" discriminates against them and firmly advocate that a "free trade area" must be established simultaneously to offset this discrimination. British officials and bourgeois newspapers have repeatedly stated that the United Kingdom will take "retaliatory action." British Prime Minister Macmillan even blatantly threatened: "If we are economically divided, then we cannot be politically united." Although the Ministerial Council of the "Six Countries" announced a temporary measure on December 3rd, stipulating that the eleven non-"Common Market" countries can temporarily share the benefits of tariff reductions and increased import quotas within the "Common Market" scope, making a temporary concession to the United Kingdom, according to an Associated Press report, the British government still believes that this has not completely eliminated the "Six Countries'" discrimination against countries outside the "Common Market," and is therefore considering taking "protective" measures to deal with the "Six Countries."

This quarrel among the member countries of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" is a pungent satire on the so-called "cooperation" between capitalist countries. Their very sharp economic contradictions have already pierced the veil of "cooperation" and been exposed without reservation.

The dispute over the "Common Market" and "free trade area," which began more than two years ago, boils down to solving one question: Which of the three major capitalist countries in Europe should enjoy economic and political dominance over other capitalist countries in Europe and their colonies—France? West Germany? Or the United Kingdom?

Among the three countries, France is the weakest in economic strength. Neither in production capacity nor in the competitiveness of commodities is it a match for the United Kingdom and West Germany. It hopes to find a way out by uniting one country to squeeze another out of the Western European market, laying the foundation for its plan to dominate Western Europe. France initially wanted to bring the United Kingdom into the "Common Market" to achieve the "double-edged" effect of both restraining the United Kingdom and squeezing out West Germany. However, the United Kingdom has its own plans and is unwilling to be bound by the "Common Market." Instead, it proposed a "free trade area" plan that would both maintain its original sphere of influence and enjoy the benefits of the Western European market. As a result, France changed its approach and joined forces with West Germany to resist the United Kingdom. Especially since de Gaulle came to power, France has increasingly leaned towards establishing a Bonn-Paris axis, attempting to develop the "Common Market" economic alliance into a political alliance led by France in Western Europe. The reason why France has taken the lead in opposing the "free trade area" plan this time is to prevent the United Kingdom from interfering in the affairs of continental Western Europe through the union of the "free trade area" and the "Common Market." However, is West Germany a reliable ally of France?

West Germany and France are completely sleeping in the same bed with different dreams! The West German monopoly capitalist groups, fostered single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, are of course happy to use the "Common Market" to squeeze out their only powerful competitor in the Western European market—the United Kingdom. However, to think that West Germany is doing this not to establish its own hegemony in continental Western Europe, but only to pave the way for France's plan to dominate, is tantamount to believing in gods and monsters. In fact, West Germany's ambition is even greater. It not only attempts to dominate the Western European continental market, but also strives to enter a wider market. Therefore, West Germany is not as active as France in the struggle against the "free trade area" plan, but plays the role of a "conciliator." West Germany is not afraid of competing with the United Kingdom. If the United Kingdom is willing to open up its sphere of influence, West Germany does not necessarily have to close the Western European continental market to the United Kingdom. West German Economic Minister Erhard, while pointing out that the six "Common Market" countries are willing to allow the eleven countries, including the United Kingdom, to temporarily share the benefits of the "Common Market," also emphasized that "these countries are welcome to take similar actions." Moreover, Erhard went to London on behalf of the "Six Countries" to ask the United Kingdom to reach a more lasting working arrangement agreement with the "Six Countries." Erhard's activities give people reason to believe that West Germany played a major role in facilitating the "Six Countries'" temporary concessions to the United Kingdom. The reason why West Germany is playing this role is obviously to exchange for the United Kingdom's agreement to open up its Commonwealth sphere of influence so that West German goods can enter into competition.

The United Kingdom, on the one hand, cannot tolerate being squeezed out of the market of the six continental Western European countries (which accounts for one-seventh of the United Kingdom's exports), and on the other hand, is afraid that its sphere of influence will be eroded by West Germany and the United States behind West Germany. Therefore, it firmly opposes the "Common Market" and proposes a "free trade area." For the threat to the United Kingdom, the "Common Market" will enable U.S. monopoly capital to use Europe's cheaper labor to produce large quantities of goods marked "Made in West Germany," "Made in France," or "Made in the Netherlands" on the outer shells, squeezing out British goods in the world market. The British "News Chronicle" wrote worriedly: "The most unfortunate result for Britain is that, in due course, the larger, mass-production factories being set up for the Common Market will compete with British companies. Many American companies are already planning to set up factories." The worries of this British bourgeois newspaper are indeed not alarmist! The reason why the United States is doing its utmost to support West German monopoly capital and strongly supports the establishment of a Western European "Common Market" with West Germany as its core is not only to facilitate the control of Western Europe to promote arms expansion and war preparation, but also to strike at the United Kingdom. The December 1st issue of the U.S. "Foreign Policy Association Bulletin" could not help but lavishly praise the fact that "the export of American capital is currently the most interesting and active feature of the Common Market" in an article commenting on the "Common Market."

The struggle between the "Common Market" and the "free trade area" fully proves that what dominates capitalist countries is the desire to drown their competitors. Now, the seventeen countries of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" have announced that they will hold a special economic meeting "in the near future" to discuss the temporary working arrangements between the "Six Countries" and the other eleven countries. However, the inherent economic contradictions between capitalist countries, no matter how much "arrangement" they go through, cannot be concealed, let alone resolved.

    一场互相要把竞争者淹死的斗争
    本报评论员
    由于法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡等六国的“共同市场”即将于明年1月1日成立，“欧洲经济合作组织”的十七个成员国在所谓“自由贸易”问题上的争吵，愈来愈白热化了。“六国”由法国出面坚持壁垒性的“共同市场”计划，反对英国建议的“自由贸易区”计划；法国政府公开宣称建立那样的“自由贸易区”是不可能的。其余十一国，由英国挂帅，认为“共同市场”是对它们的歧视，坚决主张必须同时成立“自由贸易区”以抵消这种歧视；英国官方人士和资产阶级报纸不断表示英国要采取“报复性行动”；英国首相麦克米伦则更是露骨地威胁说：“如果我们在经济上分裂，那么在政治上也不能团结一致。”尽管“六国”的部长理事会在12月3日宣布了一项临时措施，规定非“共同市场”的十一国可以暂时分享“共同市场”范围内的降低关税和增加进口限额的好处，向英国作了暂时的让步；但是，据美联社报道，英国政府仍然认为这并没有完全消除“六国”对“共同市场”以外的国家的歧视，因此正在考虑采取“保护”措施以对付“六国”。
    “欧洲经济合作组织”成员国之间所展开的这一番争吵，对资本主义国家之间的所谓“合作”，是一个辛辣的讽刺。他们之间十分尖锐的经济矛盾，已经戳破了“合作”的幌子而暴露无遗。
    这一场从两年多以前就开始了的“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”之争，归根结底就是为了解决一个问题：在欧洲三大资本主义国家中，由哪一个国家享有对欧洲其他资本主义国家及其殖民地的经济上和政治上的支配权，是法国？西德？还是英国？
    在三国中，法国是经济力量最孱弱的一个，无论在生产能力上，也无论在商品的竞争力上，都不是英国和西德的对手，它希望从联合一国把另一国排挤出西欧市场的办法中找到出路，为它的称霸西欧的计划打下基础。法国最初是想把英国拉进“共同市场”，以收到既能约束英国又能排挤西德的“一箭双雕”效果。但是，英国另有自己的打算，不愿受“共同市场”的拘束，反而提出了既要保持原有的势力范围又要在西欧市场享受好处的“自由贸易区”计划。于是，法国便改而同西德联合以抗英国。特别是自从戴高乐上台后，法国越来越明显地倾向于建立波恩—巴黎轴心，企图通过“共同市场”这个经济联盟而发展为在西欧建立一个由法国领导的政治联盟。法国这次所以一马当先地极力反对“自由贸易区”计划，就是为的要防止英国通过
  “自由贸易区”和“共同市场”的联合而插手于西欧大陆的事务。然而，西德是不是法国的可靠盟友呢？
    西德同法国完全是同床异梦！由美帝国主义一手扶植起来的西德垄断资本集团，当然也乐意于利用“共同市场”来排挤它在西欧大陆市场上的唯一劲敌——英国；但是，如果以为西德这样做，不是为了建立自己在西欧大陆的霸权，而只是为法国的称霸计划开道，那就等于相信神怪了。事实上，西德的野心更大，它不仅企图称霸西欧大陆市场，还力图打进更广阔的市场。因此，西德在反对“自由贸易区”计划的斗争中，并不像法国那样积极，而是充当“调和者”的角色。西德并不怕同英国竞争，如果英国肯开放它的势力范围，西德也并不一定要向英国关闭西欧大陆市场。西德经济部长艾哈德在指出“共同市场”六国愿意使英国等十一国暂时分享“共同市场”的好处的同时，也强调指出“欢迎这些国家采取相似的行动”，而且艾哈德又代表
  “六国”跑到伦敦去要求英国同“六国”达成一个比较持久的工作安排的协议。艾哈德的这些活动，使人们有理由相信，在促成“六国”向英国作暂时让步这一点上，西德是起了主要作用的。而西德所以起这种作用，显然是为了交换英国同意开放它的英联邦势力范围，以便西德商品可以进入竞争。
    英国正是一方面不能容忍自己在西欧大陆六国的市场上被排挤（这个市场容纳了英国的出口的七分之一），另一方面又害怕自己的势力范围为西德以及在西德幕后的美国所侵蚀，所以坚决反对“共同市场”而提出“自由贸易区”。对英国的威胁来说，“共同市场”将使美国垄断资本可以利用欧洲的较便宜的劳动力，生产大批的外壳上标志着“西德制”、“法国制”或“荷兰制”的商品，在世界市场的范围内挤垮英国商品。英国“新闻纪事报”忧心忡忡地写道：“对英国的最不幸的结果是，在适当的时间内，为共同市场而建立的更加庞大的、大规模生产的工厂将要同英国的各公司展开竞争。许多美国公司已经在计划建立工厂了。”这家英国资产阶级报纸的担忧确实并非杞人之忧！美国所以竭力扶植西德垄断资本，所以大力支持建立一个以西德为核心的西欧“共同市场”，除为了便于控制西欧以促进扩军备战之外，打击英国显然也是其主要目的之一。12月1日的美国“外交政策协会公报”在一篇评论“共同市场”的文章中，就已经情不自禁地大谈其“美国资本的输出是目前共同市场最有趣和积极的特点”了。
    “共同市场”和“自由贸易区”之间的斗争，充分证明了支配着资本主义各国的是想把自己的竞争者淹死的愿望。现在，“欧洲经济合作组织”十七国宣布“在最近的将来”召开特别经济会议，来讨论“六国”同其他十一国之间的暂时的工作安排。但是，资本主义国家之间固有的经济矛盾，不论再经过怎么样的“安排”，是无法掩饰的，当然更谈不上解决的了。
