Respected Vice Premier Chen Yi, Respected Mayor Xu Jianguo, Dear Comrades, Friends, and Dear Citizens of Shanghai:

	On behalf of our delegation, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for such a grand welcome, and through you, to extend warm, brotherly greetings from the Korean people to all the citizens of Shanghai.

	We are very pleased to visit Shanghai, one of China's largest cities and industrial centers, and to witness firsthand your socialist construction.

	Shanghai is one of the birthplaces of the Chinese workers' movement and the cradle of the Communist Party of China. The workers of Shanghai have excellent revolutionary traditions in the heroic struggle against domestic and foreign enemies. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the workers of Shanghai have always held high the revolutionary banner of the Chinese working class, launching continuous mass struggles against the oppression and exploitation of foreign imperialism and the Chinese comprador bourgeoisie colluding with imperialism, thus making the history of the Chinese working class's struggle and the history of Shanghai glorious. The workers' movement in Shanghai has had a great impact on the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles in Asian countries, inspiring the liberation struggles of the Eastern peoples.

	With the victory of the Chinese revolution, Shanghai was liberated, and the old Shanghai, which suffered from imperialist oppression, is gone forever. Shanghai has become your own! It has become the property of all the Chinese people!

	Today, Shanghai is being transformed into an even more magnificent and beautiful world-renowned city. Shanghai has many industrial enterprises, and it plays a significant role in China's industrial development. The entire working people of Shanghai, led by the working class, have made great achievements in developing industry, science, technology, and culture.

	Today's Shanghai demonstrates the great creativity of the Chinese working class, who hold sovereignty in their own hands, united under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, and mobilized to create a new life. We warmly congratulate the workers and all the working people of Shanghai on their greater achievements in socialist construction.

	Like the people of all of China, the people of Shanghai are comrades-in-arms who have forged a bond of blood with the Korean people and brothers who are closely united with the Korean people. During the Korean Fatherland Liberation War, the people of Shanghai held high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, providing valuable material and spiritual assistance to the Korean people. Many people from Shanghai joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and assisted us with their blood. They demonstrated unparalleled heroism and selfless sacrifice in the struggle against the heinous enemy, establishing indelible meritorious deeds. The workers and all the working people of Shanghai provided us with a large amount of clothing and daily necessities during the war. In order to alleviate the suffering of the Korean people during the war and to send more aid to our people, you launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, even saving every penny to send to our people. In the post-war period, the people of Shanghai have provided us with various machinery, equipment, and daily necessities needed for economic recovery and development and our socialist construction, and they continue to assist us now. The valuable assistance given to our people by you and all the Chinese people is a guarantee for the victory of our Fatherland Liberation War and has made a great contribution to the rapid recovery and development of our people's economy. The happy life of our people today is imbued with the blood and sweat of all the Chinese people, and it is also imbued with the blood and sweat of the people of Shanghai. These are all manifestations of the Chinese people's boundless love for the Korean people. It further strengthens the traditional friendship and unity between our two peoples.

	On behalf of the Korean people, I would like to express my deep gratitude once again to you, who have consistently given us sincere assistance, and through you, to all the citizens of Shanghai.

	Dear Comrades: Today, on the vast land of China, revolutionary enthusiasm is boiling, and 650 million Chinese people are leaping forward along the socialist and communist road.

	In the great leap forward in socialist construction, the Chinese workers are at the forefront of the Chinese people. During our visit to various parts of China, we have seen the working class's massive revolutionary drive and endless creative talent.

	The magnificent Yangtze River Bridge and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, as well as many large-scale factories equipped with modern technology, and the nationwide mass steelmaking campaign, fully demonstrate the power of the Chinese working class.

	In terms of industrial production, Chinese workers have achieved a development speed in one year that capitalist countries could not achieve in decades. "Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do" has become the battle cry of Chinese workers and all working people. Under this slogan, they have broken superstitions and outdated ideas in science and technology and created countless miracles. Not only in cities but also in rural areas across the country, factories are being built, and industry is flourishing. Science and technology are increasingly being mastered by the whole people and are developing more rapidly relying on the wisdom of the whole people.

	We are very moved by your achievements in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor and by the creative spirit of workers producing many modern large-scale machines using the "ants gnawing at bones" method.

	The working class is not only capable of destroying the old society but also the most revolutionary, most powerful, and most talented class that is good at building a new society. Chinese workers have proven this with their own practice.

	Hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants, under the leadership of the working class, have participated in the great construction cause. The socialist transformation of the Chinese countryside has been completed, and agricultural production is leaping forward. In terms of grain production, Chinese peasants have achieved astonishing achievements. The people's commune movement, which is being widely carried out in China, has attracted our attention. We visited the people's communes with great interest, where we saw the massive construction scenes carried out by Chinese peasants. They are unreservedly displaying their enthusiasm and talents for socialist construction.

	On all fronts of socialist construction, there have been great leaps forward, and the people are full of unwavering confidence in a bright future and pride in their great cause.

	Today, the People's Republic of China is developing into an invincible power, its development further enhances the power of the entire socialist camp, strengthens the forces of peace in Asia and the world, and severely strikes the imperialists.

	Anyone who ignores the power of socialist China and dares to take risks will suffer irreparable defeat. Today, American aggressors still occupy Taiwan, an inseparable territory of the People's Republic of China, and are carrying out provocative acts that interfere in China's internal affairs and oppose the People's Republic of China. This aggressive policy of American imperialism seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world and has been unanimously condemned by peace-loving people all over the world.

	This provocative behavior of the United States has aroused great anger among the Chinese people. We have seen the soaring spirit of the entire Chinese people to thoroughly crush all the provocative acts of American imperialism. We have seen the firm will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, their inseparable territory. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will overcome all obstacles and liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands.

	All the victories and achievements of the Chinese people have been achieved under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong.

	The Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China, leading the Chinese people to new victories forever. Due to its correct policies, the Communist Party of China has received the absolute support and love of the entire Chinese people and has united them around itself like steel.

	The victory of the Chinese revolution and the great leap forward in socialist construction have shown the world the vitality of invincible Marxism-Leninism. The great achievements and rich experiences of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China have inspired the working people all over the world who are fighting for socialism, and in particular, will become an example for the people of Eastern countries who have suffered from colonial rule to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction. This is a great contribution of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to the international communist movement.

	The Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people highly praise the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and are happy to regard this achievement as their own.

	We are constantly learning from your achievements and experiences and have been greatly encouraged. We have learned a lot through this visit, which will help our socialist construction.

	The Korean people, advancing alongside the people of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, have made great achievements in socialist construction. We have completed the socialist transformation of production relations and have entered the climax of socialist construction.

	Through their own arduous struggles, the working people of our country are firmly convinced of the correctness of the Party's policies and are more strongly united around the Party, striding forward valiantly on the Chollima to accomplish the magnificent program of socialist construction put forward by the Party today.

	The working class of our country in all factories and enterprises is carrying out a mass innovation movement to increase labor productivity by two to three times. They can produce various machinery and equipment needed in large quantities in our country, and they can also build large-scale power plants and blast furnaces equipped with modern technology.

	The farmers of our country are fighting to complete the technological revolution in agricultural production in order to ensure the leap forward development of agricultural production. All farmers are vigorously carrying out the water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification of agriculture and rural areas.

	All the working people of our country clearly see the bright future and are convinced that their just cause will surely triumph.

	Under the leadership of our Party, the Korean people, with their selfless labor, are determined to build our country into a developed socialist industrial state in the next four to five years.

	Socialist construction in the northern half of our country is a decisive guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

	Today, South Korea, occupied by the United States, has fallen into a living hell of hunger and poverty. The aggressive policy of American imperialism towards South Korea hinders the peaceful reunification of our fatherland and threatens peace in the Far East.

	All the Korean people resolutely oppose the occupation of South Korea by the invading troops of American imperialism and resolutely demand that the US military immediately get out of South Korea. Peace-loving people all over the world unanimously condemn the occupation of South Korea by the invading troops of American imperialism.

	However, the American aggressors not only do not withdraw from South Korea but also instigate the Syngman Rhee gang to continue the "northward march" disturbances and turn South Korea into an American atomic and rocket base, more blatantly carrying out its aggressive policy.

	Nevertheless, this is only the deathbed struggle of imperialism heading towards death, and the American imperialists can never stop the ever-growing revolutionary power of the Korean people. The socialist power in the northern half of our country will surely grow stronger day by day, which will give the South Korean people a powerful revolutionary influence. In South Korea, the patriotic and democratic forces opposing American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang will become stronger.

	The Korean people have reliable friends such as the great Soviet people and the Chinese people in their just struggle. We have received the active support of the people of socialist countries and the sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world.

	The Korean people will achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland by strengthening internationalist solidarity and their own revolutionary power, and will firmly defend the eastern outpost of peace and socialism.

	Dear Comrades! Our government delegation, visiting the People's Republic of China, has been receiving meticulous hospitality from the fraternal Chinese people and is living extremely exciting days.

	We have been given unprecedented grand welcomes by hundreds of thousands of people everywhere we went, whether in your capital – Beijing, or in cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. The cheers of the welcoming crowds shook the heavens and the earth, and the cities and villages welcoming us appeared like festivals. Everyone embraced us with fiery emotions, and everyone treated us with the warmth of their own flesh and blood, which is a manifestation of the Chinese people's boundless love for the Korean people, which moved us very much. This once again shows the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples forged in blood, and gives us greater encouragement.

	The Korean and Chinese peoples are comrades-in-arms who share life and death and share weal and woe. Our two peoples have waged a common struggle against imperialist aggressors, and our blood has flowed together.

	Our two peoples, with their united strength, inflicted military and political defeats on the American aggressors, who boasted of being the "most powerful in the world."

	Today, our two peoples are working closely together, victoriously building socialism.

	This friendship and unity can only be generated in the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, among people who are closely united by common ideas and common goals. There is no friendship more beautiful than this! There is no unity more powerful than this!

	For us, the Korean-Chinese friendship is the most precious. Therefore, the Korean people will do everything in their power to further consolidate this friendship and will always advance together with the Chinese people.

	Long live the infinite prosperity of the great Chinese people!

	Long live the friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples forged in blood!

	Long live the invincible unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

	Long live lasting world peace!

    美好的友谊  有力的团结
    金日成首相在上海欢迎朝鲜政府代表团大会上的讲话尊敬的陈毅副总理同志，尊敬的许建国副市长同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们，亲爱的上海市民们：
    我以我们代表团的名义谨向你们表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们这样盛大的欢迎，并通过你们向全体上海市民转达朝鲜人民的热烈的兄弟般的问候。
    我们来到中国最大的城市、工业中心之一——上海市进行访问，并且亲眼看到你们进行社会主义建设的情形，感到十分高兴。
    上海是中国工人运动的发祥地之一，是中国共产党的摇篮。上海市工人在反对国内外敌人的英勇斗争中，具有优良的革命传统。上海市的工人们在中国共产党的领导下，一向高举起中国工人阶级的革命旗帜，为反对外国帝国主义和同帝国主义相勾结的中国买办资产阶级的压迫和剥削，展开了连续不断的群众性斗争，从而使得中国工人阶级的斗争历史和上海市的历史光辉灿烂。上海市的工人运动对亚洲各国反帝反封建的斗争发生了巨大的影响，鼓舞了东方人民的解放斗争。
    随着中国革命的胜利，上海市得到了解放，遭受帝国主义压迫的旧上海一去不复返了。上海成为你们自己的了！成为全中国人民的了！
    今天，上海市正在变为更加雄伟、更加美丽的闻名世界的城市。上海市有许多工业企业，它在中国的工业发展上起着重大的作用。以工人阶级为首的上海市全体劳动人民在发展工业和科学、技术、文化的事业中，取得了巨大的成就。
    今天的上海市，显示了把主权掌握在自己手里的中国工人阶级在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，为了创造新生活而一致动员起来所发挥的伟大的创造力。我们热烈地祝上海工人和全体劳动人民在社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。
    上海人民和全中国人民一样，是同朝鲜人民以鲜血结成的战友，是同朝鲜人民亲密团结的兄弟。在朝鲜的祖国解放战争时期，上海人民高举抗美援朝的旗帜，在物质上和精神上给予了朝鲜人民以宝贵的援助。上海市有很多人参加了中国人民志愿军，用鲜血援助了我们。他们在抗击万恶的敌人的斗争中表现了无比的英雄气概和忘我的牺牲精神，建立了不可磨灭的功勋。上海市的工人和全体劳动人民在战争时期给予了我们大量的衣物和生活必需品。为了减轻朝鲜人民在战争中所遭到的痛苦，为了送给我国人民更多的援助物资，你们展开了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，连一分钱都节约出来送给我们的人民。在战后时期，上海人民又供给我们在经济恢复发展和我国社会主义建设中所需要的各种机械设备和生活必需品，而且现在还在继续援助我们。你们和全中国人民一起给予我国人民的宝贵援助，是我们祖国解放战争胜利的保证，并对我国人民经济的迅速恢复发展作出了巨大的贡献。在今天我国人民的幸福生活里，浸透着全中国人民的血汗，也浸透着上海市人民的血汗。这些都是中国人民对朝鲜人民无限热爱的表现。它进一步加强了我们两国人民的传统友谊团结。
    我以朝鲜人民的名义，谨向始终给予我们诚挚的援助的你们，并通过你们向上海全体市民再次表示深厚的感谢。
    爱亲的同志们：今天在辽阔的中国大地上，革命热情在沸腾，六亿五千万中国人民正沿着社会主义和共产主义大道飞跃前进。
    在社会主义建设的大跃进中，中国工人走在中国人民的最前列。我们在访问中国各地的过程中，看到了工人阶级的声势浩大的革命干劲和无穷无尽的创造才能。
    雄伟的长江大桥和武汉钢铁公司等以现代技术装备起来的许多规模宏大的工厂和在全国各地蓬勃展开的全民炼钢运动，充分地证明中国工人阶级的威力。
    在工业生产方面，中国工人在一年内达到了资本主义国家在几十年内也达不到的发展速度。“敢想、敢说、敢做”已经成为中国工人和全体劳动人民的战斗口号。他们在这一口号下，破除了在科学技术方面的迷信和陈旧观点，创造了不胜枚举的奇迹。不仅在城市而且在全国各地乡村建设工厂，工业正在蓬勃发展。科学和技术正在日益被全民所掌握，并依靠全民的智慧更加迅速地发展。
    你们在实行教育和劳动生产相结合的方针中所取得的成就，工人们以“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法生产许多现代化大型机械的创造精神，使我们非常感动。
    工人阶级不仅能够破坏旧社会、而且是善于建设新社会的最革命、最有力量、最有才能的阶级。中国工人以自己的实践证明了这一点。
    亿万中国农民在工人阶级的领导下，参加了伟大的建设事业。中国农村已经完成了社会主义改造，农业生产正在飞跃发展。在粮食生产方面，中国农民已取得了令人惊异的成就。正在中国广泛展开的人民公社化运动，引起了我们的注意。我们以极大的兴趣参观了人民公社，在那里看到了中国农民所进行的声势浩大的建设情景。他们为了建设社会主义毫无保留地发挥出自己的热情和才能。
    在社会主义建设的各个战线上，都出现了大跃进，人民群众满怀着对光明未来的坚定不移的信心和对自己伟大事业的自豪感。
    今天，中华人民共和国正在发展成为不可战胜的强国，它的发展更加提高了整个社会主义阵营的威力，加强了亚洲和世界和平的力量，沉重地打击了帝国主义者。
    谁要忽视社会主义中国的威力，胆敢冒险，那末，谁就要遭到不可挽救的失败。今天，美国侵略者还侵占着中华人民共和国不可分割的领土——台湾，进行着干涉中国内政和反对中华人民共和国的挑衅行为。美帝国主义者的这种侵略政策，严重地威胁了亚洲和世界的和平，遭到了全世界爱好和平人民的一致谴责。
    美国的这种挑衅行为引起了中国人民极大的愤怒。我们看到了全中国人民要彻底粉碎美帝国主义的一切挑衅行为的冲天气概。我们看到了中国人民要解放自己不可分割的领土台湾的坚强意志。我们坚信，中国人民一定会克服一切障碍，解放台湾和沿海岛屿。
    中国人民的一切胜利和成就，都是在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下所取得的。
    中国共产党和毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国的具体实践创造性地结合起来，使中国人民永远走向新的胜利。由于自己正确的政策，中国共产党受到了全中国人民的绝对支持和爱戴，并把他们钢铁般地团结在自己的周围。
    中国革命的胜利和社会主义建设的大跃进，向全世界显示了战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的生命力。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下所取得的巨大的成就和丰富的经验，鼓舞了为社会主义而斗争的全世界劳动人民，特别是将成为曾经遭受过殖民主义统治的东方各国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的榜样。这是中国共产党和中国人民对国际共产主义运动的伟大贡献。
    朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民高度赞扬中国人民在中国共产党的领导下所取得的成就，并且把这个成就当做自己的成就而感到高兴。
    我们不断地学习你们的成就和经验，并且得到了巨大的鼓舞。我们通过这次访问，学到了很多东西，这将有助于我们的社会主义建设事业。
    同以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民并肩前进的朝鲜人民，在社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就。我们已经完成了生产关系方面的社会主义改造，并且进入了社会主义建设的高潮。
    我国劳动人民通过自己艰巨斗争的体验，坚信党的政策的正确性，并更加坚强地团结在党的周围，为完成今天党所提出的社会主义建设的宏伟纲领，正跨上千里马奋勇前进。
    在所有工厂和企业中的我国工人阶级，为提高劳动生产率二——三倍而进行着群众性的革新运动。他们能生产我国所大量需要的各种机器设备，也能建设以现代技术装备起来的规模宏大的发电厂和高炉等等。
    我国的农民为了完成农业生产的技术革新，以便保障农业生产的飞跃发展而进行斗争。全体农民正在大力开展农业的水利化、机械化和农村的电气化运动。
    我国的全体劳动人民都清楚地看到光明的未来，并且确信自己的正义事业一定胜利。
    在我们党的领导下，朝鲜人民以自己的忘我劳动，决心在今后四——五年内，把我国建设成为发达的社会主义工业国家。
    在我国北半部的社会主义建设是争取祖国和平统一的决定性的保证。
    今天，被美国强占的南朝鲜，已经陷入了饥饿与贫穷的活地狱。美帝国主义对南朝鲜的侵略政策，阻碍我们祖国的和平统一，并且威胁远东的和平。
    全朝鲜人民坚决反对美帝国主义侵略军队强占南朝鲜，并且坚决要求美军立即滚出南朝鲜去。全世界爱好和平人民一致地谴责美帝国主义侵略军队强占南朝鲜。
    然而，美国侵略者不但不从南朝鲜撤走，反而唆使李承晚匪帮继续“北进”骚动，并把南朝鲜变为美国的原子及火箭基地，更加露骨地进行着它的侵略政策。
    尽管如此，这只不过是走向死亡的帝国主义的垂死挣扎，美帝国主义者决不能阻挡朝鲜人民日益增长的革命力量。我国北半部的社会主义力量，一定会一天比一天的增强，这将给予南朝鲜人民以有力的革命影响。在南朝鲜，反对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的爱国的民主力量将会更加强大。
    朝鲜人民在自己正义的斗争中有伟大的苏联人民和中国人民那样可靠的朋友。我们得到了社会主义各国人民的积极支援和全世界爱好和平人民的同情。
    朝鲜人民将以加强国际主义团结和自己的革命力量来实现祖国的和平统一，并将牢固地保卫和平和社会主义的东方前哨。
    亲爱的同志们！来中华人民共和国进行访问的我们政府代表团，受到了兄弟般的中国人民的无微不至的款待，过着极其令人激动的日子。
    我们在你们的首都——北京，在武汉、广州、杭州、上海等城市到处受到几十万群众的前所未有的盛大欢迎。欢迎群众的欢呼声震动了天地，迎接我们的城市和乡村都出现了节日般的景象。所有的人，都以火热的情感拥抱我们，所有的人都像自己亲骨肉般的热忱地接待了我们，这就是中国人民对朝鲜人民的无限热爱的表现，使我们非常感动。这再一次显示了朝中两国人民以鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的友谊和团结，并使我们得到更大的鼓舞。
    朝中两国人民是同生死、共患难的战友。我们两国人民为反对帝国主义侵略者进行了共同的斗争，我们的鲜血流在一起。
    我们两国人民以团结起来的力量，给予自己吹嘘为“世界上最强大”的美国侵略者，以军事、政治上的惨败。
    今天，我们两国人民紧密合作，胜利地建设着社会主义。
    这种友谊和团结，是只能在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中，以共同的思想和共同的目标紧密团结起来的人民之间才能产生的。再也没有比这种友谊更加美好的！再也没有比这种团结更加有力的！
    对我们来说，朝中友谊是最宝贵的，因此，朝鲜人民为了更加巩固这种友谊，将竭尽自己的一切力量，永远同中国人民一道前进。
    伟大的中国人民的无限繁荣万岁！
    朝中两国人民以鲜血凝结成的友谊、团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的统一、团结万岁！
    世界持久和平万岁！
