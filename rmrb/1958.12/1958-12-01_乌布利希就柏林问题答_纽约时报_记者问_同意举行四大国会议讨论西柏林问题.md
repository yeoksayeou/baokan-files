Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 30th. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said yesterday when he met with American "New York Times" reporter Mr. Gruenther that there is only one German government in Berlin, namely the government of the German Democratic Republic, despite the fact that West Berlin is still occupied by foreign troops. The withdrawal of foreign troops and the abolition of foreign intelligence agencies would fundamentally change the situation in West Berlin.

The American reporter asked Ulbricht what measures the German Democratic Republic would take if Western countries refused to recognize the Soviet government's transfer of supervision rights over the transportation lines between West Germany and West Berlin to the German Democratic Republic.

Ulbricht said that if they do not intend to create difficulties for themselves, they must implement universally recognized rules. This is that these routes "can only be used under certain specified conditions stipulated by the government of the German Democratic Republic." It is unimaginable that Western powers can use its transportation routes without the permission of the German Democratic Republic. If Mr. Dulles truly proceeds from reality, then he would naturally agree to hold negotiations with the government of the German Democratic Republic on the use of certain transportation routes.

When talking about the future situation in West Berlin, Ulbricht said that the formation of a West Berlin government and administrative organization is the matter of the West Berlin people themselves. The relationship between a demilitarized West Berlin and democratic Berlin will undoubtedly improve rapidly. This relationship must be built on the basis of peace and democracy, which is also in the interests of the people of West Berlin. As a free city, West Berlin will belong neither to the West nor to the East, but will be a truly free and independent city. It will develop relations with both Germanys and countries in Eastern and Western Europe, and overcome the current isolated state of only having relations with the West under foreign occupation.

The reporter then asked Ulbricht whether he agreed to hold a Four-Power conference to discuss the suggestions on the Berlin issue in the Soviet government's note.

Ulbricht replied: "The German Democratic Republic agrees to such an international conference, as long as such a conference can promote the realization of the suggestions made by the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic within six months."

When talking about the reunification of Germany, Ulbricht said: "The basis for reunification can only be the principles of the anti-Hitler alliance solemnly established by the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at that time. This basis is in line with the national interests of the German people. There can be no other basis." He said that militarism has once again become a dangerous thing that threatens the survival of the German people and the people of other countries. A system like West Germany will make free elections in all of Germany impossible. If the people of West Germany are prohibited from voting on the issue of arming the West German army with atomic weapons and on the major issues of the German people's national survival, then how can we talk about free elections? Under the pressure of atomic rearmament, banning the German Communist Party, persecuting peace fighters, carrying out "psychological warfare," and preparing to implement emergency laws, there is no basis for free elections at all. "As for all-German elections, such elections can only be a matter for the Germans themselves, just as elections in the United States are a matter for the Americans themselves."

Ulbricht said: "Under the current development of two different social systems in the two Germanys, any attempt to force another country to accept its own social system is impossible. This would mean civil war. We must first bring the two Germanys towards peaceful contact, which is also the purpose and meaning of a confederation."

    乌布利希就柏林问题答“纽约时报”记者问
    同意举行四大国会议讨论西柏林问题
    新华社柏林30日电  德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希昨天在接见美国“纽约时报”记者格鲁森时说，在柏林只有一个德国政府，即德意志民主共和国政府，尽管西柏林还有外国军队占领着。而撤退外国军队和取消外国特务机关就会使西柏林的状况发生根本改变。
    美国记者问乌布利希，如果西方国家拒绝承认苏联政府把西德到西柏林之间的运输线的监督权移交给民主德国的话，民主德国将采取什么措施？
    乌布利希说，如果他们不打算给自己制造困难的话，就必须实行到处公认的规矩。这就是这些路线“只能按照民主德国政府所规定的条例的某些指定条件下加以利用”。不能想像西方大国没有民主德国的许可而使用它的交通路线。如果杜勒斯先生真正是从现实情形出发，那么他就自然赞同和民主德国政府举行使用某些交通路线的谈判。
    在谈到西柏林未来的情况时，乌布利希说，组成一个西柏林政府和管理机构是西柏林人民自己的事。一个非军事的西柏林和民主柏林之间的关系，毫无疑问将会很快得到改善。这种关系必须建筑在和平和民主的基础上，这也是符合西柏林人民的利益的。作为自由市的西柏林，将既不属于西方也不属于东方，而是真正自由、独立的城市。它将会发展同两个德国以及东西欧各国的关系，而克服目前在外国占领的情况下只同西方发生关系的孤立状态。
    记者又问乌布利希，是否同意举行四大国会议讨论苏联政府照会中关于柏林问题的建议。
    乌布利希回答说：“只要这种会议能够在六个月内促进苏联政府和民主德国政府建议的实现，那么，民主德国同意这种国际性会议。”
    在谈到德国重新统一问题时，乌布利希说：“重新统一的基础只能够是为美国总统、英国首相和苏联部长会议主席当时隆重制定的反希特勒同盟的原则。这一基础符合德国人民的民族利益。而另外一种基础是不可能有的。”他说，军国主义今天又成为威胁德国人和其他国家人民生存的危险的东西。西德这样一种制度会使全德的自由选举成为不可能的事。如果西德人民在决定原子武器武装西德军队的问题上和在德国人民民族生存的主要问题上被禁止进行表决的话，那么怎么能谈得上自由选举呢？在进行原子备战、禁止德国共产党、迫害和平战士、进行“心理战”以及准备实行紧急状态法的压力下，根本谈不到自由选举。“至于全德选举，那么，这样的选举只能是德国人自己的事，正像美国的选举是美国人自己的事一样”。
    乌布利希说：“在两个德国目前有两种不同的社会制度的发展情形下，任何强迫另外一个国家接受自己的社会制度的企图，都是不可能的。这将意味着内战。必须首先使两个德国走向和平的接触，这里也正是邦联的目的和意义。
