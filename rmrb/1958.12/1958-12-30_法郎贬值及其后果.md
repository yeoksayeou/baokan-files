The French government announced the devaluation of the franc and the implementation of limited free convertibility on December 27. This is the seventh devaluation of the franc since the end of the war. If we compare the exchange rate of the franc before the war in 1914, we can see how serious the devaluation of the franc has become. This reflects, to some extent, the decline of French imperialism. The devaluation of the franc is shown in the following table.

	Year		Franc to Dollar Ratio
	1914		5.18
	February 1934	15
	October 1, 1936	21.5
	May 5, 1938	36
	February 20, 1940	43.8
	September 1, 1944 (Liberation) 49.267
	December 26, 1945	119.107
	January 26, 1948	214.392
	October 17, 1948	264
	April 27, 1949	272
	September 20, 1949	350
	August 10, 1957	420
	December 27, 1958	493.7

This table shows that in thirty-four years, the value of the franc against the dollar has decreased to almost 1% of its value in 1914.

However, despite this, de Gaulle desperately shouted on radio and television on December 28: This is to "restore France's international position in the economic field," and "only in this way can France prosper." French Finance Minister Pinay also said: "The purpose of this policy is to maintain France's equal status as a major power among free nations."

De Gaulle made such an unpopular move only six days after being elected president, which was also compelled by the situation. Because the official opening of the European "Common Market" is imminent (January 1, 1959), de Gaulle had no choice but to take this step in order to cope with competition inside and outside the "Common Market."

French goods are more expensive than those of the other five countries in the "Common Market," especially compared to West Germany. The prices of French goods are generally 10% to 15% higher than similar West German goods, so they are at a disadvantage in competition. The devaluation of the franc can reduce the export price of French goods. For example, if a French product originally cost 493 francs, which would be about $1.17 at the old exchange rate of 420 francs to the dollar, it now costs less than one dollar, which is cheaper than before. This is conducive to French goods competing with goods from other countries in foreign markets. At the same time, higher import prices can restrict imports from other countries, reduce France's trade deficit, and increase foreign exchange. This is the first point.

Secondly, in order to take retaliatory measures against the establishment of a "Common Market" by Western European countries, Britain decided to implement limited free convertibility of the pound in order to打击法郎, attract other countries to do business with Britain, and expand the British market. In order to cope with this attack from Britain, France also decided to implement free convertibility of the franc.

To implement the above two points, especially to compete with Britain, France does not have enough capital and must rely on West Germany's economic support. Because West Germany has abundant gold and dollar reserves (currently nearly six billion US dollars), West Germany's mark is not only stronger than the franc, but also stronger than the pound. De Gaulle is trying his best to issue a so-called "heavy franc" with a value equivalent to the West German mark (one "heavy franc" is equivalent to 100 current francs), which is to use the West German mark to stabilize the franc. Under such circumstances, the franc has no choice but to bow to the mark and implement devaluation.

It can be seen that the devaluation of the franc and the implementation of limited free convertibility are manifestations of the intensification of contradictions between imperialist countries in the struggle for markets. This contradiction and struggle have made the major capitalist countries in Western Europe unwilling to maintain even superficial unity, and they are willing to take measures that will cause the "European Payments Union" to collapse.

French monopoly capital implemented the devaluation of the franc in order to compete inside and outside the "Common Market," but the benefits that this measure can obtain can only be temporary and limited. However, it poses a major threat to the lives of the French working people. De Gaulle said that in order to prevent the devaluation from increasing the huge budget deficit, it is necessary to announce "increasing corporate taxes, increasing taxes on high-income earners, imposing new taxes on alcohol, spirits and tobacco, abolishing many subsidies on consumer goods, and reducing budgetary assistance to nationalized enterprises, especially railways." At the same time, "social insurance will pay for itself, and veterans will be asked to give up their pensions if they are in good condition." Pinay also said that in this way, "consumers will bear some of the price increases that the government originally hoped would not occur in bread and milk." De Gaulle also said that he expected prices to rise as a result. What does all this mean? In a word, in order for French monopoly capital to make money, the French people must "tighten their belts" and endure sacrifices. This is the "benevolent government" of De Gaulle, the new president, to the French people.

The devaluation of the franc cannot improve France's economic position. On the contrary, it can only deepen the contradictions between imperialist countries and deepen the people's dissatisfaction with and opposition to the rule of monopoly capital.

    法郎贬值及其后果
    林生
    12月27日，法国政府宣布法郎贬值并实行有限度的自由兑换。这一次法郎贬值已经是战后以来第七次了。如果对照战前1914年法郎的比价来看，那末可以看出法郎贬值已经到了何等严重的地步。这在一定程度上反映了法国帝国主义的没落。法郎贬值情况列于下表。
  年  份    法郎对美元的比率
  1914年      5.18

  1949年9月20日    350
  1957年8月10日    420
  1958年12月27日    493.7
    这张表说明在三十四年中法郎对美元的比值几乎降低到为1914年比值的1％。
    但是尽管如此，戴高乐却在12月28日在电台和电视广播中拚命喊叫说：这是为了“使法国在经济方面恢复国际地位”，“唯有这样才能使法国繁荣起来”。法国财政部长比内也说：“这个政策的目的在于维持法国在自由国家中作为一个大国的平等地位。”
    戴高乐在他当选总统六天之后，就做出这样一件不得人心的事，这也是为时势所迫。因为欧洲“共同市场”的正式开张迫在眉睫（1959年1月1日），为了应付“共同市场”内部和外部的竞争，戴高乐不得不出此下策。
    法国的商品跟“共同市场”其他五国，特别跟西德比较，成本是较高的。法国商品的价格一般比同类西德商品要贵10％到15％，因此在竞争上处于不利地位。法郎贬值就可以降低法国货物的出口价格。譬如原来一件法国货要四百九十三法郎，按对美元的旧比值四百二十法郎算，在国外就得卖一元一角七美元左右，而现在只要一元钱不到，比以前便宜了。这样就有利于法国货在国外市场上同其他国家的商品竞争。同时，这样一来进口价格要高，就可以限制别的国家的入口，使法国入超减少，外汇增加。此其一。
    其次，英国为了对西欧国家建立“共同市场”的行动采取报复措施，决定英镑实行有限度的自由兑换，借以打击法郎，吸引别的国家来跟英国做生意，扩大英国的市场。为了应付英国的这一攻击，法国遂也决定实行法郎自由兑换。
    法国要实行上述两点，特别是跟英国斗法，法国的本钱不够，不能不靠西德的经济支持。由于西德的黄金美元储备充足（目前将近六十亿美元），因而西德的马克不但比法郎硬，而且比英镑也硬多了。戴高乐竭力要发行一种与西德马克价值相等的所谓“重法郎”（一个“重法郎”相当目前的法郎一百个），就是要借西德马克来稳定法郎。在这种情况下，法郎也不得不向马克低头，实行贬值。
    可以看出，法郎贬值和实行有限度的自由兑换，是帝国主义国家之间争夺市场的矛盾尖锐化的表现。这种矛盾和斗争，使西欧主要的资本主义国家之间连表面上的团结也不愿维持了，而不惜采取使“欧洲支付同盟”陷于垮台的措施。
    法国垄断资本为了在“共同市场”内部和外部进行竞争而实行法郎贬值，但这种措施所能得到的好处也只能是暂时的和有限的。然而，它却使法国劳动人民生活遭到重大的威胁。戴高乐说，为了使贬值不致增加巨大的预算赤字，就要宣布“增加公司赋税、增加高收入者的赋税、对酒、酒精和烟草增收新税、取消对消费品的许多贴补，以及减少预算对国有化企业特别是铁道的帮助”。同时“社会保险将自己付款，退伍军人如果境况还好的话，将请他们放弃年金”。而比内也说，这样一来“消费者将担负一些政府本来希望在面包和牛奶方面不致发生的涨价的损失。”而且戴高乐也表示：他预料物价会因而有所上涨。这一切是什么意思呢？一句话，就是为了让法国垄断资本能够赚钱，法国人民必须“勒紧裤带”忍受牺牲。这就是戴高乐这位新总统对法国人民的“仁政”。
    法郎的贬值不能使法国的经济地位有所改善，相反的只能加深帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，并加深人民对垄断资本统治的不满和反对。
