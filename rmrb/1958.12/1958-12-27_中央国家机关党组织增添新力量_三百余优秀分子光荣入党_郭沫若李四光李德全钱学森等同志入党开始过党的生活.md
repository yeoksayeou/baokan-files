Central State Organ Party Organizations Gain New Strength
    Over 300 Outstanding Individuals Gloriously Join the Party
    Guo Moruo, Li Siguang, Li Dequan, Qian Xuesen and Other Comrades Join the Party and Begin Their Party Life

    (Our News) In 1958, nearly three thousand probationary party members in central state organs were converted to full party members, and more than three hundred outstanding individuals joined the Party.

    Before the rectification campaign, the central state organs received more than three thousand probationary party members. After the education and testing of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the vast majority of them possessed the qualifications to be converted to full party members. As of the end of November 1958, statistics show that two thousand nine hundred and twenty-one probationary party members have been converted to full party members. At the same time, the central state organs also accepted three hundred and seventeen outstanding individuals who had been tested in the rectification campaign and the Great Leap Forward and met the standards of party members to become members of the Communist Party of China.

    Among these more than three hundred outstanding individuals who joined the Party, there are activists in various fields. There are young activists, as well as women activists; there are engineers, as well as technicians; there are scientists and social activists; there are administrative cadres, as well as nursery workers and apprentices; there are Han people, as well as ethnic minorities and returned overseas Chinese. For example, Comrade Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Comrade Li Siguang, Minister of Geology, Comrade Li Dequan, Minister of Health, Comrade Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, etc. Some of them participated in revolutionary struggles very early before the national liberation, or showed political progress, were enthusiastic about social progress and scientific research, and actively participated in the democratic movement. After liberation, they resolutely supported and implemented the Party's various policies and actively participated in the political movements led by the Party. For example, Comrade Wang Yuying, a nursery worker and Hui woman from the Architectural Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, was a representative attending this year's National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Conference. She has always loved her work, loved children, been able to actively contact the parents of children, and been able to closely connect with the surrounding masses. She uses her spare time to write poems for the children, which are deeply supported by the masses inside and outside the institute and the children. For example, Comrade Guo Youde, Deputy Director of the Correction Workshop of the Aerial Survey Team of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry, was a representative attending this year's National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference. Since 1954, he has been repeatedly rated as a model and advanced producer. In the technical revolution movement, he worked hard, dared to think and dared to do, and made many innovations and creations in forest photography technology. For example, Comrade Niu Jinfu, an apprentice at the Friendship Automobile Company Repair Shop of the Foreign Experts Bureau, has consistently worked actively since he started working in 1952. He was rated as a third-class outstanding worker in 1955, and was rated as a youth activist in the bureau in 1958, and also attended the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference.

    They all showed a firm stand in the rectification and anti-Rightist struggles, were able to fight against the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist Rightists, and safeguard the interests of the working class and socialism, and possessed the conditions for joining the Party. They have been discussed and approved by the general meetings of party members of the agencies and have been approved by the party committees at the higher level. Now they have been incorporated into the Party organization and have begun to live a Party life.

    中央国家机关党组织增添新力量
    三百余优秀分子光荣入党
    郭沫若李四光李德全钱学森等同志入党开始过党的生活
    本报讯  中央国家机关1958年有近三千名预备党员转为正式党员，有三百余名优秀分子入党。
    中央国家机关在整风运动前接收了三千余名预备党员。经过整风运动、反右斗争的教育和考验，他们绝大多数都具备了转为正式党员的条件。截至1958年11月底的统计，已经有二千九百二十一名预备党员转为正式党员。与此同时，中央国家机关还接收了在整风运动和大跃进运动中受过考验、合乎党员标准的三百一十七名优秀分子为中国共产党党员。
    在这三百余名入党的优秀分子中，有各个方面的积极分子。有青年积极分子，也有妇女积极分子；有工程师，也有技术员；有科学家和社会活动家；有行政工作干部，也有保育员和学徒；有汉族，也有少数民族和归国华侨。例如，中国科学院院长郭沫若同志、地质部部长李四光同志、卫生部部长李德全同志、中国科学院力学研究所所长钱学森同志等。他们中有的在全国解放以前，很早就参加革命斗争，或者在政治上表现进步，热心社会进步事业和科学研究工作，积极参加民主运动。解放后，他们坚决拥护和执行党的各项方针政策，对党所领导的历次政治运动都积极参加。又如，建筑工程部建筑科学研究院保育员、回族妇女王玉英同志，她是出席今年全国妇女社会主义建设积极分子会议的代表。她一贯热爱自己的工作，热爱孩子，能积极主动地联系孩子们的家长，能密切联系周围的群众。她利用业余的时间，还为幼儿们编写诗歌，甚得院内外群众和孩子们的拥护。再如，林业部建设局航测队纠正车间副主任郭有德同志，他是出席今年全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表。他从1954年以来，多次被评为模范、先进生产者。在技术革命运动中，他苦心钻研，敢想敢做，在森林照像技术方面有不少革新和创造。再如，外国专家局友谊汽车公司修理厂学徒牛进福同志，1952年参加工作以来即一贯工作积极，1955年被评为三等优秀工作者，1958年被评为全局青年积极分子，又出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    他们在整风和反右派斗争中都表现立场坚定，能够同反共、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子进行斗争，维护工人阶级、维护社会主义的利益，具备了入党条件。他们已经由机关支部党员大会讨论通过加入了中国共产党，并且经过上一级党的委员会的批准。现在他们已经被编入党的组织，开始过党的生活。
