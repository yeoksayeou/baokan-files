Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Tokyo dispatch: Japan Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō, Advisors Kawakami Jōtarō, Nishio Suehiro, and Military Base Countermeasures Special Committee Chairman Yamahana Hideo, among others, held a meeting in Kobe City today. They condemned the deceptive tactics currently employed by the Kishi Nobusuke government regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately cease diplomatic negotiations with the United States on revising the treaty, and resolved to unite a mass force even greater than the thriving national movement that was united in the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," to fight for the abolition of the current U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The policy decided by the Socialist Party leaders' meeting today stated that the Socialist Party would also tear off the mask of the Kishi Nobusuke government's foreign policy and reveal to the Japanese people that the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is aimed at strengthening the U.S.-Japan joint combat system and dragging Japan into war. To this end, the Socialist Party will promote a national movement even larger in scale than the struggle against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill."

The policy stated that the Socialist Party will struggle to achieve the complete return of Okinawa and Ogasawara to Japan, to oppose the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan, to oppose the establishment of missile bases, for Japan to declare its own ban on nuclear armament, and to establish a nuclear-free zone in Asia.

The policy pointed out that regarding the issue of negotiations on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Foreign Minister Fujiyama once said: "The new treaty will not be a mutual defense treaty, but a treaty for leasing bases; consultations will be held in advance regarding the deployment and use of U.S. forces stationed in Japan; because Okinawa and Ogasawara are not included in the U.S.-Japan joint defense area, it will not result in strengthening U.S.-Japan military relations." The policy stated that Fujiyama's remarks, compared to Kishi Nobusuke's idea expressed in the Diet not long ago that "it should be a treaty of the nature of a mutual defense treaty; Okinawa and Ogasawara should not be included," may seem like a "retreat," but this is nothing more than a superficial appeasement to deceive the Japanese people out of fear of strong national opposition, in order to advance the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempted revision of the "Security Treaty."

The Socialist Party's policy pointed out that even as a treaty for leasing bases, the following situation will not change: U.S. troops will be stationed in Japan on a regular basis, using Japanese bases to take action throughout the Far East. Therefore, no matter where in Asia the U.S. military begins combat, Japan will be dragged into the war.

The policy pointed out that restricting the use of bases by U.S. forces stationed in Japan through prior consultation is, in fact, impossible, and doing so carries the danger of agreeing that the United States can use Japanese bases at will.

The policy stated that although the Kishi Nobusuke government says it will not include Okinawa and Ogasawara in the "defense" scope, this is only not written into the main text of the treaty; both sides can adopt the method of relaxing the regulations concerning the "defense" scope in the attached documents to include Okinawa and Ogasawara in the "defense" scope. Therefore, the Kishi Nobusuke government's statement is a way of deceiving the Japanese people. The policy revealed that just as the Kishi Nobusuke government was planning this deception, Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" Army General Imoto was clamoring in the United States: to establish a "collective defense organization" for Japan, the Rhee Syngman group, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, to equip the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons, and to form five-unit atomic divisions (divisions equipped with atomic weapons), etc.

The policy pointed out that it is clear that these words touched on the core issue of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"; Imoto's words, like the remarks made by Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke to NBC reporter Brown, exposed the essence of the Kishi Nobusuke government's approach to revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The Socialist Party leaders' meeting stated that the Socialist Party needs to carefully study the Soviet government's statement on the U.S.-Japan negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty," which was handed over to the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Menaka Tokio.

Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Tokyo dispatch: The Kyushu Prefectural Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a meeting of secretariats in Kagoshima Prefecture on the 2nd and 3rd. The meeting decided to demand the continued maintenance of the National Conference Against Malicious Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the Prefectural Residents' Conference Against Revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," and to shift the target of the struggle to opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The secretariats also unanimously agreed that they should support the national march held by temporary workers' unions from January to March next year to oppose unemployment and demand the establishment of a social insurance system.

The meeting decided to support the year-end struggle carried out by the workers.

### 动员群众力量要求废除日美“安全条约”  日本社会党决定开展巨大国民运动

    动员群众力量要求废除日美“安全条约”
    日本社会党决定开展巨大国民运动
    新华社4日讯  东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、书记长浅沼稻次郎、顾问河上丈太郎、西尾末广和军事基地对策特别委员会委员长山花秀雄等今天在神户市举行会议，他们谴责岸信介政府目前在关于修改日美“安全条约”的问题上所玩弄的欺骗手段，要求岸信介政府立即停止同美国进行修改条约的外交谈判，并且决定要团结比在反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中团结起来的蓬勃发展的国民运动更大的群众力量，来为废除现行的日美“安全条约”而斗争。
    社会党首脑会议今天决定的方针说，社会党还要撕下岸信介政府外交政策的伪装，向日本人民揭露：岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”，是为了加强日美共同作战体系，把日本卷入战争中去。为此，社会党要推进比反对“警职法修正案”的斗争规模更大的国民运动。
    方针表示，社会党将为使冲绳和小笠原全部归还日本、为反对把核武器运进日本、为反对建立导弹基地、为日本自己宣布禁止核武装、为在亚洲建立禁止核武装地区而进行斗争。
    方针指出，关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判问题，外务相藤山曾经说：“新条约将不作为一个共同防御条约，而是作为一个租借基地的条约；关于驻日美军的部署和使用，要在事前进行协商；因为不把冲绳和小笠原划入日美共同防御地区，所以不会造成增强日美军事关系的结果。”方针说，藤山的这番话，同岸信介不久以前在国会表明的“要把它作为共同防御条约一类的条约；不把冲绳和小笠原包括进去”的想法比较起来，看起来似乎是“后退”了，但是，这不外乎是由于害怕国民坚决反对，所以要在表面上缓和一下，来欺骗日本国民，以便推进岸信介政府企图进行的修改“安全条约”的工作。
    社会党的方针指出，即使作为一个租借基地的条约，下述情况也不会改变：美军经常驻在日本，使用日本基地，在整个远东地区采取行动。因此，不论美军在亚洲任何地点开始作战，日本都会被卷进战争中去。
    方针指出，用事前协商的办法来限制驻日美军使用基地，事实上这是办不到的，这样做反而有答应美国可以随便使用日本基地的危险。
    方针说，岸信介政府虽然说将不把冲绳和小笠原划入“防御”范围，可是，这只是不写进条约的本文罢了；双方可以采取在附属文件中放宽有关“防御”范围的规定的办法来把冲绳和小笠原划入“防御”范围里去。因此，岸信介政府的这种说法是蔽蒙日本国民的说法。方针揭露，就在岸信介政府策划这种欺骗的时候，日本“自卫队”的陆军将领井本却在美国叫嚷：要建立日本、李承晚集团、蒋介石集团“集体防御机构”，要用核武器装备日本“自卫队”，要组成五单位制原子师（有原子武器装备的师）等等。
    方针指出，很明显，这些话接触到了修改日美“安全条约”的核心问题；井本的这些话，同岸信介首相向美国全国广播公司记者布朗发表的谈话一样，暴露了岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的这种做法的本质。
    社会党首脑会议表示，对于苏联外交部长交给日本驻苏联大使门胁季光的苏联政府关于日美两国举行修改“安全条约”的谈判的声明，社会党需要作慎重的研究。
    新华社4日讯  东京消息：日本九州各县工会评议会2日和3日在鹿儿岛县举行了事务局长会议。会议决定要求继续保持反对恶劣修改“警察官职务执行法”国民会议和反对修改“警察官职务执行法”县民会议的组织，并且要把斗争目标转为反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。
    事务局长们还一致认为，应当支援临时工工会明年1月到3月为了反对失业和要求建立社会保险制度而举行的国民大游行。
    会议决定要支援工人们进行的年终斗争。
