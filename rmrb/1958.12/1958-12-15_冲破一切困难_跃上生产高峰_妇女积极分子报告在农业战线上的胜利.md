Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Those who spoke at the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference today were mostly production experts who had created various high yields on the agricultural front. They overcame various difficulties and suppressed conservative ideas, and finally became the top names on the bumper harvest list.

The five women and two men in a women's professional team of the "Satellite" People's Commune in Xiping County, Henan Province, planted 1.72 mu of high-yield wheat fields this year, with an average yield of 7,201 jin per mu. Last year, an experimental group of five women from the "Steel" People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, created a record of 2,963 jin per mu on 1.11 mu of experimental rice paddy, and this year, 0.1 mu of paddy field yielded 1,287 jin of rice. The experimental fields planted by the women of the "Chaomei" People's Commune in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, had a maximum yield of 2,540 jin per mu for early rice, an average yield of 4,180 jin per mu for mid-season rice, and a maximum yield of 10,274 jin per mu for late rice. Yang Guilian, Peng Xueying, and Tang Taoxiu, the women activists who led the planting of these experimental fields, introduced their experiences in achieving bumper harvests at the meeting today. A common thread in their speeches was that throughout the entire process, from the beginning of planting the experimental fields to creating high-yield records, they encountered various obstacles from conservatives and skeptics, but in the end, they were the ones who triumphed, and even the conservatives had to nod in praise.

People enthusiastically praised a group of brave and hardworking young women, giving them a glorious title: "Iron Girls." The "Iron Girls Team" of the Chengguan People's Commune in Juye County, Shandong Province, planted 1,162 mu of high-yield fields this year, with an average yield of 2,441 jin of grain (including corn, millet, sorghum, etc.) per mu. Li Fengcun, the instructor of this "Iron Girls Team," introduced their heroic deeds of seizing grain from the earth in her speech today. At the beginning, their team only had 56 people, but now it has grown to 1,000. Because they created miracles in production, the masses have changed their views of them and no longer call them "yellow-haired girls." In the "Shou Zhang" People's Commune in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, there is also a group of "Iron Girls" who are not afraid of anything. They fought hard for a winter and transformed 48 mu of barren sandy land into fertile fields, achieving high yields. One mu of corn yielded 12,000 jin. The local people call them "Satellite Girls." Zhao Fengling, the deputy captain of this "Iron Girls Team" composed of five girls, spoke at the meeting today with the title "Iron Girls Become Satellite Girls." She said that their "Iron Girls Team" has now developed into a "Youth Women's Satellite Team" of more than 100 people.

In Yanghe area of Xiaogang People's Commune, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, the average yield of cotton used to be only 30-40 jin of seed cotton per mu. This year, 100 "Cotton Girls" of the Qun'ai team of this commune broke with conservative ideas, painstakingly studied techniques, deeply plowed and finely cultivated, and created a large-area high-yield record of 1,458 jin and 4 liang of ginned cotton per mu on 107 mu of cotton fields. Yang Jurong, the women's captain of this team, who spoke at the meeting today, achieved a yield of 2,795 jin and 4 liang of ginned cotton per mu on her 1 mu experimental field.

Gong Yingchao, director of the Women's Federation of Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, introduced the "High-Yield Girl" movement in the prefecture at the meeting. The girls in this prefecture planted more than 530,000 mu of experimental fields this year, most of which achieved high yields. Their common slogan is: "Who is the hero, who is the good man, let's compete in the experimental field." In the process of planting experimental fields, the girls' production skills have been greatly improved, and various experts have emerged. The whole region has selected 231,391 "Rice Girls," 200,2155 "Cotton Girls," 73,763 "Wheat Girls," and more than 97,000 "Bumper Harvest Girls" in other fields. Gong Yingchao said that because women actively participated in production labor and achieved high yields, their social status has been greatly improved, and family relations have been further improved.

Shen Hui, a representative from Yongchun County, Fujian Province, reported to everyone on the initial electrification and mechanization of Yongchun County and the efforts made by women in this great construction. Now, Yongchun County has built a total of 67 hydroelectric power stations, 468 hydraulic stations, 5 biogas plants, and 10 thermal power stations, and more than 15,000 households have electric lights. Electricity is used from grain processing and water conservancy irrigation to various small industries. More than 11,900 women in the county participated in the construction of hydroelectric power stations, and many hydroelectric power stations and hydraulic stations were named "Women's Hydroelectric Power Station" or "Women's Hydraulic Processing Plant" because women contributed the most. Women have also invested and donated materials to support the construction of hydropower.

A total of thirteen people spoke at the conference this morning, including: Luo Jinfang, a representative from Shanxi Province, who was called "Mu Guiying" on the water conservancy construction site, in the experimental field, and next to the iron smelting furnace; Wang Dehua, a representative of the sericulture team of the "Fly Leap" People's Commune in Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province, who created the miracle of feeding silkworms 15 times a year by adopting the method of cross multiple sericulture; Xu Xiuying, a Mongolian breeder of the Keerqin People's Commune in Keerqin Left Wing Middle Banner, Zhelimumeng League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who has learned a variety of technologies such as pig farming, artificial insemination of sheep, and sheep breeding; Zhuoma, a Tibetan woman from Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai, who grew up in the upsurge of socialist transformation on the grasslands and is now the vice president of the People's Commune; Guo Xiulian, a member of the Longmen Fisheries Cooperative in Longmen Town, Qin County, Guangdong Province.

The conference will continue on the 15th.

Correction: Hou Yufen, Director of the Teaching and Research Office of the Department of Chemical Engineering of Dalian Institute of Technology, also spoke at the National Women's Activist Representative Conference on the 13th. She introduced the situation of the teachers and students of the Department of Chemical Engineering marching towards science.

    冲破一切困难  跃上生产高峰
    妇女积极分子报告在农业战线上的胜利
    新华社14日讯  今天在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议上发言的人，绝大部分都是在农业战线上创造出各种高额产量的生产能手。她们战胜了各种困难，压倒了保守思想，终于成为丰产榜上名列前茅的人。
    河南省西平县卫星人民公社一个妇女专业组的五名妇女和两名男子一起，今年种了一点七二亩小麦高额丰产田，平均亩产七千二百零一斤。湖北省枣阳县钢铁人民公社五名妇女组成的试验小组去年种的一亩一分一厘水稻试验田，创造了亩产二千九百六十三斤的纪录，今年有一分稻田又收到稻谷一千二百八十七斤。湖南省湘乡县超美人民公社的妇女们种的试验田，早稻最高亩产量是二千五百四十斤，中稻平均亩产量是四千一百八十斤，晚稻最高亩产量是一万零二百七十四斤。领导种植这些试验田的妇女积极分子杨桂莲、彭学英、唐桃秀今天在会上介绍了她们取得丰收的经过。她们发言中有一个共同点，那就是她们从开始种植试验田直到创造高额丰产纪录的整个过程，都遇到保守派和怀疑派的种种阻力，但是最后胜利的终于是她们，连保守派也不得不点头称赞。
    人们热情地称赞一群英勇勤劳的青年妇女，送给她们一个光荣称号：“铁姑娘”。山东省巨野县城关人民公社有一个“铁姑娘团”，今年种了一千一百六十二亩丰产田，平均亩产粮食（包括玉米、谷子、高粱等）二千四百四十一斤。这个“铁姑娘团”的指导员李凤存今天在发言中介绍了她们向大地争夺粮食的英雄业迹。开始时，她们这个团只有五十六人，现在已发展到一千人。因为她们在生产中创造了奇迹，群众都转变了对她们的看法，不再叫她们“黄毛丫头”了。在山东省寿张县人民公社也有一群天不怕地不怕的“铁姑娘”，她们苦战了一个冬天，把四十八亩荒沙薄地改造成良田，获得了高额丰产，有一亩玉米就产了一万二千斤。当地群众把她们叫做“卫星女”。这个由五个姑娘组成的“铁姑娘队”的副队长赵凤苓今天在会上用“铁姑娘变成卫星女”这个题目发言，她说，她们那个“铁姑娘队”现在已经发展成一百多人的“青年妇女卫星队”了。
    湖北省孝感县肖港人民公社杨河一带，过去种棉花平均只能亩产三、四十斤籽花，今年这个公社群爱小队的一百个“棉花姑娘”，打破了保守思想，苦钻技术，深耕细作，创造了一百零七亩棉田平均亩产一千四百五十八斤四两皮棉的大面积丰产纪录。今天在会上发言的这个小队的妇女队长杨菊容种的一亩试验田，亩产皮棉达到二千七百九十五斤四两。
    湖北省襄阳专区妇联主任宫颖超在会上介绍了这个专区开展高额丰产姑娘运动的情况。这个专区的姑娘们今年共种了五十三万多亩试验田，绝大部分都获得高额丰产。她们共同的口号是：“谁是英雄谁好汉，试验田里比比看”。在种试验田过程中，姑娘们的生产本领有了很大的提高，涌现出各种能手，全区共评选出“水稻姑娘”二十三万一千三百九十一人，“棉花姑娘”二十万零二千一百五十五人，“小麦姑娘”七万三千七百六十三人，其他方面的“丰产姑娘”九万七千多人。宫颖超说，因为妇女们积极参加生产劳动，获得了高额丰产，她们的社会地位大大提高，并且进一步改善了家庭关系。
    来自福建省永春县的代表沈慧向大家报告了永春县实现了初步电气化、机械化的情况和妇女们在这一伟大建设中所作的努力。现在永春县共建成六十七个水电站，四百六十八个水力站，五个沼气厂，十个火力电站，有一万五千多户点上了电灯。从粮食加工、水利灌溉到各种小型工业都使用了电力。全县有一万一千九百多名妇女参加了修建水电站的劳动，许多水电站、水力站都因为妇女出力最多而被命名为“妇女水电站”或“妇女水力加工厂”。妇女们还纷纷投资献料，支援水电化的建设。
    在今天上午大会上发言的共十三人，她们之中还有：在水利工地上，在试验田里，在炼铁炉旁都被称作“穆桂英”的山西省代表罗金芳，采取交叉多次养蚕法、创造年饲十五次蚕的奇迹的浙江省永康县飞跃人民公社蚕桑专业队代表王德花，学会养猪、绵羊人工授精、绵羊配种等多种技术的内蒙古自治区哲里木盟科尔沁左翼中旗科尔沁人民公社蒙古族饲养员徐秀英，在草原上的社会主义改造高潮中成长起来，现在担任了人民公社副社长的青海果洛藏族自治州藏族妇女卓玛，广东省钦县龙门镇龙门渔业社社员郭秀莲。
    15日，大会将继续举行。
    补正：在13日全国妇女积极分子代表会议上发言的人还有大连工学院化工系教研室主任侯毓汾，她介绍了化工系师生向科学进军的情况。
