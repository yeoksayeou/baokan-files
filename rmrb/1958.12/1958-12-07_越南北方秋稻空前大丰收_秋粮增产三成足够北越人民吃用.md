Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 5th. North Vietnam has achieved its largest autumn rice harvest in history this year.

According to preliminary statistics from the State Planning Commission of Vietnam: the total output of autumn rice reached more than 3.26 million tons, exceeding the planned target by 28%. Including the summer rice, Vietnam's total rice production this year is 4.5 million tons, 8% higher than 1956, the best year on record, and exceeding the annual total production plan by 10%.

Because the summer rice in North Vietnam suffered from drought and partial reduction in production this year, the Vietnamese government put forward the slogan of "using autumn to compensate for summer." Now this slogan has been successfully realized through the efforts of the Vietnamese people.

According to preliminary statistics from the State Planning Commission, the average yield of rice per hectare in North Vietnam this year is 2.3 tons (equivalent to more than 306 *jin* per *mu*), while it was only 1.8 tons in 1956, the best year.

In many *xiang* in Ha Nam, Ha Dong, Ninh Binh and other provinces, the average yield per hectare of rice in the entire *xiang* reached more than 4 tons (equivalent to more than 530 *jin* per *mu*), doubling the yield of last year. The yield per hectare of some mutual aid teams reached more than 10 tons, equivalent to more than five times last year's.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 6th. Our reporter reports: The good news of the unprecedented bumper harvest has spread throughout North Vietnam, from the northern border to the 17th parallel. In recent days, Hanoi newspapers have been publishing daily reports and pictures of bumper harvests from various provinces, inspiring the people of North Vietnam who are struggling hard throughout the year.

Vast stretches of golden rice fields have been harvested in rural areas, and the yield per unit area in many villages has doubled compared to last year. According to preliminary statistics, the total output of autumn grain in North Vietnam has increased by nearly 30% compared to last year, and more than doubled the pre-war peak level of autumn rice harvest in 1939.

In 1939, the output of autumn rice in North Vietnam was 1.54 million tons; the annual output of dry grain was about 2.5 million tons. This amount was not enough for the people of North Vietnam to eat. At that time, 500,000 tons had to be transferred from South Vietnam every year.

This year's autumn rice has not yet had a final accurate statistical survey; the lowest estimate is 3.26 million tons; the lowest estimate for the annual harvest of dry grain is 4.5 million tons. This is not only enough for the people of North Vietnam to eat, but can also be transported to grain-deficient South Vietnam—if the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are willing.

Obviously, North and South Vietnam have formed a clear contrast in food production. The Mekong Delta in South Vietnam has always been known as the "granary" of the East, but in recent years it has become increasingly unworthy of this title. In 1939, the annual output of dry grain in the former "Cochinchina" alone reached 3.8 million tons, but in 1957 the output of dry grain in the entire South Vietnam was only 3.41 million tons, which was less than the pre-war output of the former "Cochinchina."

Amidst the good news of the unprecedented bumper harvest, the people of North Vietnam are confidently stepping up their efforts to ensure that the annual output of grain in North Vietnam will far exceed the pre-war peak annual output of 6.5 million tons in the entire Vietnam (including South Vietnam) in 1939 within one year.

### 越南北方秋稻空前大丰收  秋粮增产三成足够北越人民吃用

    越南北方秋稻空前大丰收
    秋粮增产三成足够北越人民吃用
    新华社河内5日电  越南北方今年秋稻获得了有史以来最大的丰收。
    据越南国家计划委员会统计局的初步统计：秋稻总产量达到三百二十六万多吨，超过计划指标的28％。连夏稻在内，越南今年的稻子总产量是四百五十万吨，比年景最好的1956年高出8％，超过了全年总产量计划的10％。
    由于今年越南北方夏稻受旱而部分减产，越南政府提出了“以秋补夏”的口号，现在这个口号已经在越南人民的努力下胜利实现。
    据国家计划委员会初步统计，今年越南北方稻子每公顷的平均产量是二·三吨（合每市亩三百零六市斤多），而年景最好的1956年只有一·八吨。
    在河南、河东、宁平等省不少的乡内，全乡稻子的平均单位面积产量每公顷达四吨（合每市亩五百三十多市斤）以上，比去年翻了一番。有的变工组的每公顷单位面积产量达十吨以上，等于去年的五倍多。
    新华社河内6日电  本社记者报道：空前丰收的喜讯，传遍了从北方边境到十七度线的整个北越。这几天来，河内各报连日刊载各省丰收的捷报和图片，振奋了正在苦战一年的北越人民。
    各地农村一片片金黄色的稻田已经收割完毕，不少村庄的单位面积产量比去年翻了一番。据初步统计，全北越秋粮总产量比去年增加了将近三成，比战前最高水平1939年的秋稻收成加了一番以上。
    1939年北越秋稻产量为一百五十四万吨；全年干谷约产二百五十万吨。这个数目不够北越人民食用。那时候，每年要从南越调进五十万吨。
    今年秋稻还没有最后的精确统计，最低估计为三百二十六万吨；全年干谷收获最低估计为四百五十万吨。这不但够北越人民吃用，还可以输往缺粮的南越——假如吴庭艳当局愿意的话。
    很显然，南北越在粮食生产上已经形成了鲜明的对照。南越湄公河三角洲向来以东方“谷仓”闻名，但是近年来它越来越不配这个称号。1939年仅前“交趾支那”干谷年产量即达三百八十万吨，1957年全南越的干谷产量却只剩三百四十一万吨，还不及前“交趾支那”战前的产量。
    北越人民在空前丰收的喜讯当中，正在信心百倍地加紧努力，要使北越粮食的年产量，在一年内远远超过战前1939年全越南（包括南越）的最高年产量——六百五十万吨。
