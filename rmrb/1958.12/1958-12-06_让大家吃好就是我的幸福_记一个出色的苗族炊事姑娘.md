    Making Sure Everyone Eats Well is My Happiness
    ——A Profile of an Outstanding Miao Cook
    By Our Correspondent Liu Yangshen
    Deep in the Miao mountains, the sound of the ox horn signaling dinner echoes through the villages as people return from work. Zhang Xiuzhen, a Miao girl working in the collective canteen, along with other cooks, warmly invites the commune members to sit down and serves the dishes to each family's table.
    The Miao commune members, having worked hard all day, are a bit tired. But as they enter the canteen, the sight of the steaming sour soup and the aroma of sweet potato rice instantly invigorates them. Company commander Pan Huaixiu gulps down a large bowl of sour soup and happily tells Zhang Xiuzhen, "A bowl of sour soup after work is truly refreshing." Some commune members praise the sweet potato rice for being fragrant and sweet, even better than glutinous rice with white sugar. Even the usually quiet elderly people praise Zhang Xiuzhen for being clever and capable, young yet able to serve everyone well.
    Zhang Xiuzhen is the daughter of a Miao poor peasant, and she is twenty-two years old this year. Until a month ago, she was the production team leader of the Unity People's Commune in Lushan County. In late October, the commune transferred her to the canteen to be in charge of cooking in order to strengthen the work of the collective canteen.
    In the past, Zhang Xiuzhen's own meals were cooked by her mother and sister-in-law. Now, suddenly, she has to manage cooking for more than three hundred people, which is not an easy task. In the first few days, either the rice was undercooked, or the dishes didn't suit everyone's taste. Although the commune members didn't say anything, the amount of leftover food on the tables each time made her feel very bad. "Can't let everyone go hungry while building socialism?" Zhang Xiuzhen, a member of the Communist Youth League, was determined to complete the glorious task assigned by the Party, making the rice delicious and the dishes fragrant, so that everyone could eat well and work even harder. From then on, she learned cooking and rice-cooking techniques from others with experience in cooking, and at the same time, she often sought the opinions of the commune members, observing what everyone liked and disliked, and grasping the rules of the commune members in terms of diet.
    Early November was the season when sweet potatoes were ripe. In order to save some rice, the canteen cooked a large amount of sweet potatoes every day. At first, the sweet potatoes were all eaten up, but after only two or three days, there were gradually more and more leftovers. Why? After investigating among the masses, she realized that there were shortcomings in the cooking techniques. She proposed a plan to the canteen management committee to refine the cooking of coarse grains, suggesting that the sweet potatoes be chopped and mixed with the rice to be steamed together. The resulting sweet potato rice was fragrant, sweet, and attractive, and only eighty-three catties of rice were needed for each meal for more than three hundred and sixty people, with the rest being sweet potatoes. Those who used to say sweet potatoes were not tasty are now worried about what to do when the sweet potatoes are gone.
    In order to make the rice suit everyone's different tastes, Zhang Xiuzhen cooked the rice a little harder for the general young and middle-aged people, so that it would be more filling; the rice for the elderly was cooked softer, so that it was easy to eat and digest; the children in the kindergarten could not eat dry rice, so she specially cooked porridge for the children. In short, she wanted everyone to eat to their satisfaction, and make both the old and young happy. For the three or four elderly people and patients who could not come to the canteen, she delivered the meals to their homes every day.
    There are not many kinds of vegetables in the deep mountain areas, and now there are only Chinese cabbage, radish, chili peppers, and pumpkins. Despite this, Zhang Xiuzhen still tried her best to change the variety of dishes, striving not to repeat the same dish within two or three days.
    Over the past month, Zhang Xiuzhen has increasingly realized the importance of the responsibility of cooking and has fallen in love with this noble undertaking even more. She often says: As long as I can serve everyone in the canteen well, and let everyone eat their fill and eat deliciously, what does it matter if I personally work a little harder! That would be my greatest happiness. Someone composed a mountain song for her:
    Zhang Xiuzhen, truly capable,
    Rises early and sleeps late, cooking meals,
    You seek happiness for everyone,
    Everyone works hard to boost production,
    You guard the stove, I go to the fields,
    Next year, the grain will be piled high as mountains.

### 让大家吃好就是我的幸福——记一个出色的苗族炊事姑娘

    让大家吃好就是我的幸福
    ——记一个出色的苗族炊事姑娘
    本报记者  刘扬深
    苗岭深处，大山林寨收工吃晚饭的牛角号声响了，集体食堂的苗族姑娘张秀珍正和别的炊事员一道，殷勤地招呼社员坐好，把菜送到各家的桌子上。
    劳动了一整天的苗族社员们都有点累了。但一走进食堂，看到热腾腾的酸汤菜，闻到扑鼻的红薯饭香，顿时又活跃起来了。连长潘怀秀一口气喝了大半碗酸汤，高兴地对张秀珍说：“干活过后喝碗酸汤，真是浑身松快。”旁边有的社员称赞红薯饭煮得又香又甜，简直赛过糯米加白糖。连不大爱说话的老年人也夸奖张秀珍心灵手巧，人小却会当大家。
    张秀珍是一个苗族贫农的女儿，今年二十二岁。一个月以前，她还是炉山县团结人民公社的生产小队长。10月下旬，公社为了加强集体食堂工作，把她调到食堂负责做饭做菜。
    张秀珍过去自己吃的饭，都是母亲和嫂子做的。现在一下子要她管做三百多人的饭，这不是一件容易的事。开初几天，不是煮夹生饭，就是菜不合大家口味。社员虽然不说什么，每次桌上剩的许多饭菜却使她心里十分难受。“不能让大家空着肚子去建设社会主义？”共青团员张秀珍下定决心完成党交给的光荣任务，做到饭好菜也香，使大家吃得有劲，干活更有劲。从此她一方面向其他有炊事经验的人学习炒菜、煮饭的技术，一方面经常征求社员的意见，观察大家喜欢吃什么、不喜欢吃什么，掌握社员们在饮食上的规律。
    11月初，正是红薯成熟的季节。食堂为了节约一部分大米，每天都煮了大量红薯。起初几顿，红薯都被吃光了，可是刚过两三天，剩下的红薯就逐渐多了。为什么呢？她深入群众一了解，原来是做的技术上有缺点。她就向食堂管理委员会提出粗粮细吃的方案，建议把红薯切碎掺在饭里一起蒸吃。这样做成的红薯饭又香又甜又好看，三百六十多人一顿饭只需八十三斤米，其余全是红薯。过去说红薯不好吃的人，现在却担心红薯吃完了怎么办。
    为了把饭做的适合各人不同的胃口，张秀珍对一般青壮年的饭煮得硬一些，吃了耐饿；老年人的饭煮得软些，好吃也好消化；幼儿园的孩子吃不了干饭，她就专为孩子煮稀饭。有三、四个老人和病人不能到食堂来，她就每天把饭菜送到他们家去。总之，让每个人都吃得称心合意，老幼欢喜。
    深山地区蔬菜种类不多，现在数来数去只不过白菜、萝卜、辣椒、南瓜。尽管这样，张秀珍还是千方百计把吃菜的花样变一下，力求三两天内不吃重菜。
    一个月来，张秀珍愈来愈认识到炊事工作的责任重大，更爱上了这项崇高的事业。她常说：只要能把全食堂的人都服侍好，让大家吃得饱、吃得香，我个人辛苦点算得了什么！那才是我最大的幸福。有人为她编了这样一首山歌：
    张秀珍，真能干，
    起早睡晏做菜饭，
    你为大家谋幸福，
    大家努力搞生产，
    你守灶边我下地，
    明年粮食堆成山。
