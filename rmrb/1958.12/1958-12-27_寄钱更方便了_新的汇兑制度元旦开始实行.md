    Sending Money Made Easier
    New Remittance System to be Implemented Starting New Year's Day

    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to implement a new postal remittance system starting January 1, 1959. The new remittance system is formulated based on the principles of facilitating the masses and simplifying procedures. With the new remittance system, the remitter only needs to fill out a remittance slip and obtain a remittance receipt to complete the procedure. There is no need to purchase stamps and send a separate registered letter like the current method. The payee can collect the money at the nearest post and telecommunications office or station upon receiving the remittance notice. The remitting post office can also proactively handle delivery and personally deliver the remittance to the payee.

    The new postal remittance system was piloted in selected post and telecommunications offices in various provinces and cities from September to November, and was well received by the masses.

    寄钱更方便了
    新的汇兑制度元旦开始实行
    本报讯  邮电部决定从1959年1月1日起，实行新的邮政汇兑制度。新的汇兑制度是根据便利群众、简化手续的原则制订的。实行新的汇兑制度，汇款人只填一张汇款通知单，取得汇款收据，手续就算完毕。不用在汇款的同时，像现在办法再购买邮票和另寄挂号信了。收款人收到汇款通知单，即可在就近邮电局、所取款，兑付邮局还可主动办理送汇，将汇款亲自投送给收款人。
    新的邮政汇兑制度曾先后于9至11月间，在各省、市选择若干邮电局组织试点，深受广大群众的欢迎。
