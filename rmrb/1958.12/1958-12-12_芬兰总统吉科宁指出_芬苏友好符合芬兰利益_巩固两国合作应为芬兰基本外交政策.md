Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 11th December – TASS reports from Helsinki on 10th December: Finnish President Kekkonen delivered a lengthy radio address on the evening of the 10th regarding foreign policy issues and Finland's relations with the Soviet Union. He said: In Finland's foreign policy, the dominant issue is our relationship with our eastern neighbor, the Soviet Union. This is a matter of our fundamental foreign policy, and it determines the future of our people.

He said: All the Finnish people should sincerely devote themselves to consolidating the friendly relations and cooperation between our two countries. "Our foreign policy should never be against the Soviet Union, and we should convince our eastern neighbor that this view of ours is unshakeable."

Kekkonen said, in analyzing the development of Finnish-Soviet relations, the pinnacle of our foreign policy success was the agreement signed in the autumn of 1955 regarding the Soviet Union's early return of the Porkkala Peninsula to Finland.

He then pointed out some phenomena hindering the development of friendly relations between the two countries. He said, "Our national interests require restoring our relations with the Soviet Union." The President said, "There should not be any doubt anywhere in the world that, as long as I am the President of the Republic, I will always exercise the presidential powers prescribed by the Constitution to prevent any changes in Finnish foreign policy."

Kekkonen continued, some people have offered us "advice" through many newspapers and other means in Western countries regarding what we should do. Some have promised to aid and support us in dire days. But, allow me to tell those who offer us "advice" that we certainly do not need others' aid; we should pursue our own foreign policy. It was like this in the past, and it will be like this in the future.

    芬兰总统吉科宁指出
    芬苏友好符合芬兰利益
    巩固两国合作应为芬兰基本外交政策
    新华社11日讯  据塔斯社赫尔辛基10日讯：芬兰总统吉科宁10日晚上就外交政策问题和芬兰同苏联的关系问题发表了长篇广播演说。他说：在芬兰的外交政策中，占主导地位的是我们同东部邻国——苏联的关系的问题。这是我们的基本外交政策的问题，它决定着我国人民的未来。
    他说：全体芬兰人民应当真诚地致力于巩固我们两国的友好关系和合作。“我们的外交政策永远也不应该反对苏联，我们应当使我们的东方邻国相信我们的这种看法是不可动摇的”。
    吉科宁在分析芬兰同苏联的关系的发展时说，我们的外交政策成功的顶点是1955年秋天签订的关于苏联把波卡拉半岛提前交还芬兰的协定。
    他接着指出了妨碍两国友好关系发展的一些现象。他说，“我们的民族利益要求恢复我们同苏联的关系。”总统说，“世界上任何地方也不可能有任何怀疑，只要我是共和国总统，我就永远行使宪法所规定的总统大权来防止芬兰外交政策的改变”。
    吉科宁接着说，有人通过西方国家很多报纸以及其他方式向我们提出了关于我们应当怎样做的“忠告”。有人答应在倒霉的日子援助和支持我们。但是，请允许我告诉那些向我们提出“忠告”的人，我们一定不要他人援助，我们应当自己奉行我们的外交政策。从前是这样，今后我们还是这样。
