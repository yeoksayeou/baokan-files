(Our Taiyuan dispatch, December 26th) In the socialist competition, Guxian Iron and Steel Plant in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company are learning from each other, helping each other, and jointly leaping forward.

This competition between the two iron and steel enterprises began in early October. At that time, Guxian Iron and Steel Plant, with its simple equipment and low technical level, surpassed Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in steel production due to its vigorous mass movement. After this sensational event was published in the Shanxi Daily, the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company rose to catch up. In the two-month competition, the two sides had their wins and losses. Currently, the competition has expanded from steelmaking to steel rolling, ironmaking, and coking.

Mutual encouragement and mutual assistance are the characteristics of this competition. After Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company heard the news that Guxian Iron and Steel had overtaken them, the factory director and the Party committee secretary immediately rushed to Guxian with worker representatives to learn from their experience in launching mass movements. The enthusiasm of the Guxian Iron and Steel workers motivated the cadres, employees' families, and retired veteran workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel to actively engage in the steelmaking upsurge. Steel production quickly caught up with Guxian Iron and Steel. Guxian Iron and Steel also sent people to Taiyuan Iron and Steel to keep abreast of each other's production changes and new experiences. When Taiyuan Iron and Steel first surpassed Guxian Iron and Steel, they promptly drew up the advanced furnace types and operating methods of Taiyuan Iron and Steel and sent them back to their factory. A few days later, Guxian Iron and Steel organized the "Huaihai Campaign" and surpassed Taiyuan Iron and Steel again. During the competition, both sides congratulated and encouraged each other, and provided mutual assistance and support in technology and equipment. For example, both sides lacked pig iron, but Guxian Iron and Steel workers believed that the needs of key enterprises should be met first, so they transferred more than 1,600 tons of good iron to Taiyuan Iron and Steel. Taiyuan Iron and Steel has set an example of large factories helping and leading small factories in this competition. For example, Guxian Iron and Steel's rolling equipment could not be used due to a lack of parts, so Taiyuan Iron and Steel used its own spare parts to support Guxian Iron and Steel.

This competition has promoted the ideological and technological revolution of the workers in the two enterprises. After Guxian Iron and Steel first overtook Taiyuan Iron and Steel, the Party committee of Taiyuan Iron and Steel immediately mobilized all the workers in the factory to launch a debate on "Why can Guxian Iron and Steel overtake Taiyuan Iron and Steel?" The workers realized that Guxian Iron and Steel had grown up during the Anti-Japanese War. Although the factory was small, it had always adhered to and carried forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, as well as the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living. Taiyuan Iron and Steel was a large factory, but it lagged behind Guxian Iron and Steel for a time due to its "old-fashioned sluggishness" and complacency. This great debate aroused the workers' determination not to fall behind and to catch up quickly. In the past, only one-fortieth of the factory could make steel, but now the vast majority of workers have learned to make steel. The excellent results achieved by Guxian Iron and Steel workers under the conditions of simple equipment and low technical level also freed some cadres of Taiyuan Iron and Steel from the shackles of "solely relying on conditions." Through their own practice, Guxian Iron and Steel workers also broke the original notion that "small factories cannot compete with large factories." In the competition, Guxian Iron and Steel actively improved its production technology, and made its steelmaking and ironmaking leap from the "small indigenous groups" to the "small foreign groups" stage.

Wave after wave of competition climaxes have led to a steady increase in the production of the two factories. Since Taiyuan Iron and Steel launched the competition with Guxian Iron and Steel in October, it has launched a vigorous mass movement, and its steel production has doubled. The highest daily output of Guxian Iron and Steel reached more than 2,100 tons, which was twenty times higher than the original.

    一场友谊赛  两地共提高
    故钢太钢互相学习互相帮助互相促进
    本报太原26日电  山西省长治市故县钢铁厂和太原钢铁公司在社会主义竞赛中，互相学习，互相帮助，共同飞跃前进。
    这两个钢铁企业的竞赛是在十月初展开的。当时，设备简陋、技术水平低的故县钢铁厂，由于大搞群众运动，钢产量超过了太原钢铁公司。这件震动人心的事件在山西日报公布以后，太钢职工奋起直追，在两个多月的竞赛中，双方互有胜负。目前，竞赛已由炼钢扩展到轧钢、炼铁、炼焦等方面。
    互相激励，互相帮助，是这场竞赛的特色。太钢听到故钢赶过自己的消息以后，厂长、党委书记立即和工人代表一起连夜赶到故钢，学习他们大搞群众运动的经验。故钢职工的干劲推动太钢的干部、职工家属、退休老工人都积极投入了炼钢热潮。钢产量很快追上故钢。故钢也派人到太钢随时了解对方的生产变化和新经验。当太钢第一次赶过故钢时，他们及时把太钢先进的炉型和操作方法绘成图纸，寄回厂里。几天后，故钢组织了“淮海战役”，再次超过了太钢。竞赛中，双方都互相祝贺鼓舞，并在技术上、设备上互相帮助，互相支援。如竞赛双方都缺生铁，而故钢职工认为应该尽先满足重点企业的需要，便调出一千六百多吨好铁给太钢。太钢在这次竞赛中树立了大厂帮助和带动小厂的榜样。例如，故钢的轧钢设备因为缺少机件不能使用，太钢便用本厂的备件支援故钢。
    这次竞赛促进了两个企业职工思想和生产技术上的革命。故钢第一次赶过太钢以后，太钢党委立即发动全厂职工开展“故钢为什么能赶过太钢”的辩论。职工们认识到，故钢是抗日战争中成长起来的，厂子虽小，但是厂里一直坚持和发扬了敢想敢干的精神和艰苦朴素的光荣传统。太钢是大厂，却因“老大疲沓”和有自满情绪，以致一度落后于故钢。这场大辩论激起了职工们不甘落后、急起直追的劲头。过去全厂会炼钢的人仅达四十分之一，现在绝大部分职工都学会了炼钢。故钢职工在设备简陋、技术水平低的情况下创造出优异的成绩，还使太钢一些干部从“唯条件论”的束缚中解脱了出来。故钢职工通过自己的实践，也打破了一些人原来认为“小厂不能跟大厂竞赛”的观念。故钢在竞赛中积极改进了生产技术，使炼钢、炼铁由“小土群”跃进到“小洋群”的阶段。
    一浪接一浪的竞赛高潮，使这两个厂的生产节节高涨。太钢从10月份和故钢展开竞赛以后，大搞群众运动，钢产量提高了一倍。故钢钢的日产量最高达到二千一百多吨，比原来提高了二十倍。
