On April 11, 1958, Liang Sizhuang and Geng Ji'an, the deputy librarians of Peking University Library, brought four volumes of the Ming Dynasty manuscript of the Yongle Encyclopedia to the Beijing Library and handed them over to the library for collection. The content of these four volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia is the second half of Li Daoyuan's Waterways Classic. The first half, also four volumes, had already been donated to the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government by the Board of Directors of the Commercial Press in 1951, and the Ministry of Culture had already allocated them to the Beijing Library. With this, the Yongle Encyclopedia edition of the Waterways Classic was complete. This is a great joyous event worthy of celebration in the library community.

The Yongle Encyclopedia is the largest and most magnificent encyclopedia in ancient China. It has a total of 22,937 volumes and 11,095 books. The Ming Dynasty government mobilized a large number of intellectuals and spent five years concentrating on collecting seven or eight thousand kinds of ancient and modern books to complete the editing work. From 1562 to 1567 (the forty-first year of Jiajing to the first year of Longqing in the Ming Dynasty), a copy was made. The one currently circulating is this copy.

In 1900, when the imperialist Eight-Power Allied Forces plundered the Hanlin Academy in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beijing, part of the Yongle Encyclopedia was burned, and part was stolen abroad by the imperialist armies. The large-scale destruction and looting of the Yongle Encyclopedia caused irreparable losses to the supply of materials for the study of Chinese literature, art, history, and applied sciences. Thousands of Song and Yuan Dynasty gazetteers, medical books, poetry collections, zaju operas, southern dramas, and Pinghua stories in the Yongle Encyclopedia have been lost or mostly lost. There are also many ancient books with scientific reference value that are still circulating to this day, such as the Qimin Yaoshu, the Nong Sang Ji Yao, and the Yingzao Fashi, all of which are fully quoted in the Yongle Encyclopedia. If the Yongle Encyclopedia had not been destroyed, we would definitely be able to compare and study the Yongle Encyclopedia edition and the current edition and produce a definitive edition to serve scientific research. However, this wish can no longer be realized.

In the past, the Beijing Library made great efforts to collect the surviving Yongle Encyclopedia, holding one hundred and ten volumes. In 1951, the Leningrad University Library of the Soviet Union returned eleven volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia left over from the Tsarist era to the Ministry of Culture of our Central People's Government. In 1954, the Lenin Library of the Soviet Union returned 52 volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia originally stored in the Mantetsu Library of Japan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government. In 1955, when Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic visited our country, he returned three volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia from the Leipzig University Library in Germany to our Central People's Government. These three batches of the Yongle Encyclopedia were successively allocated to the Beijing Library for collection. In addition, in 1951, the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Commercial Press also donated 21 volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia that the Hanfenlou of the Commercial Press had painstakingly collected over the years to the Beijing Library. In the same year, Vice Mayor Zhou Shutao of Tianjin and Mr. Zhao Yuanfang also donated one volume each of the Yongle Encyclopedia they collected to the Beijing Library. The Beijing Library has also made sporadic purchases in recent years. As of recently, the Beijing Library's collection of the Yongle Encyclopedia, including the four volumes transferred from Peking University Library, totals 214 volumes. If we add the "Dream" character rhyme volume of the Yongle Encyclopedia transferred by the Soviet Academy of Sciences accepted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union in 1954, the Yongle Encyclopedia collected by our national institutions actually reaches 215 volumes. This number has increased significantly compared to the number counted by the Beijing Library when it held the "Yongle Encyclopedia Exhibition" in 1951 to thank the Leningrad University Library of the Soviet Union for returning the Yongle Encyclopedia. At that time, according to incomplete statistics, there were about 207 volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia collected by various foreign libraries and private collectors. The Yongle Encyclopedia collected by the Beijing Library and other libraries in China, as well as private collectors, including the eight volumes looted to Taiwan by the Kuomintang reactionary group before the liberation of Nanjing, totaled about 160 volumes. The Yongle Encyclopedia collected by libraries and private collectors at home and abroad totaled about 370 volumes. Now, the Beijing Library has collected 214 volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia, and the Yongle Encyclopedia collected by the libraries and private collectors of various imperialist countries has dropped to about 150 volumes. What a gratifying thing this is!

The Yongle Encyclopedia edition of the Waterways Classic is a relatively outstanding edition of the Waterways Classic. It and the surviving Song edition and the Ming Dynasty manuscript formerly owned by Shen Bianzhi are from the same source. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Dai Dongyuan said that the text of the Waterways Classic he proofread was mostly supplemented according to the Yongle Encyclopedia. Now, the Yongle Encyclopedia edition of the Waterways Classic has been photoprinted and published by the Commercial Press. It has been generally recognized by many scholars that Dai Dongyuan used the results of Zhao Yiqing and Quan Zuwang's proofread editions, "pretending" that they were from the Yongle Encyclopedia, rather than actually coming from it. In addition to being used to overturn the case of Dai's proofread Waterways Classic, the Yongle Encyclopedia edition of the Waterways Classic itself also has many characteristics that can be used for comparative research.

In order to expand scientific research, the Beijing Library plans to microfilm the Yongle Encyclopedia and supply it to major libraries and research institutions as reference materials for scientific research.

At the same time, I sincerely hope that the national library community will also learn from the spirit of Peking University Library, which forgets the small self and establishes the great self, and check the library's collection. If important books are found that can supplement the deficiencies of other libraries, a decision should be made through consultation to allow these books to "reunite" as soon as possible. This is very beneficial for the library's collection, publication, and scientific research work. For example, the Da Yi Cui Yan, engraved by the Shuzhou (now Shucheng, Anhui) Gongshi Library in 1176 (the third year of Chunxi in the Southern Song Dynasty), was originally collected in the Tianlu Linlang of the Forbidden City. Later, Puyi took it to the puppet palace in Changchun. After the liberation of Changchun, part of this book is now stored in the Palace Museum in Beijing, and part is now stored in the Liaoning Provincial Library. The Shuzhou edition of the Da Yi Cui Yan is not only a valuable material for the study of the history of philosophy, but also an important specimen for the research work of material cultural history. Another example is the Da Tang Liu Dian, engraved by the Wenzhou State School in 1134 (the fourth year of Shaoxing in the Southern Song Dynasty). Now, the Beijing Library, the Peking University Library, and the Nanjing Museum each have several volumes. The collections of these three units are all books from the Chongwen Pavilion of the Yuan Dynasty and were originally a set. It is hoped that the relevant units will resolve it reasonably through consultation.

In short, the event of Peking University Library transferring the Yongle Encyclopedia edition of the Waterways Classic to the Beijing Library is a good start for cooperation in the national library community. It is hoped that this communist spirit of cooperation will be further promoted.

    永乐大典本水经注破镜重圆记
    赵万里
    1958年4月11日，北京大学图书馆副馆长梁思庄、耿济安两同志携带了明抄本永乐大典四册送到北京图书馆，交给该馆收藏。这四册永乐大典的内容，就是郦道元水经注的后半部。前半部也是四册，早在1951年商务印书馆董事会已经捐献给中央人民政府文化部，文化部早已拨交北京图书馆。到此，永乐大典本水经注，配成全书。这是图书馆界值得庆贺的大喜事。
    永乐大典是我国古代一部卷帙最庞大，规模最宏伟的大百科全书。一共有二万二千九百三十七卷，一万一千零九十五册。明朝政府动员了广大知识分子，费了五年时间，集中了古今图书七、八千种，才完成了编辑工作。1562年到1567年（明嘉靖四十一年到隆庆元年）又重抄了一部副本。现在流传的，就是这部副本。
    1900年帝国主义的八国侵掠军劫掠北京东交民巷翰林院的时候，永乐大典的一部分被焚毁了，一部分被帝国主义军队盗运出国。永乐大典的大量被毁被劫，造成了研究中国文学、艺术、历史、应用科学各方面资料供应上无可补偿的损失。永乐大典内数以千计的宋元两朝地志和医书、诗文集、杂剧、南戏、平话等都失传了或大部分失传了。也有不少富有科学参考价值一直到现在还流传着的古书，例如齐民要术、农桑辑要、营造法式等等，永乐大典里都全部引用着。如果永乐大典没有毁掉，我们一定能够把永乐大典本和现行本比较研究，搞出一部定本来为科学研究服务。但是，这个愿望，现在已经无法实现。
    北京图书馆过去曾经大力搜集残存的永乐大典，藏有一百一十册。1951年苏联列宁格勒大学图书馆将帝俄时代遗留下来的永乐大典十一册送还我中央人民政府文化部。1954年苏联列宁图书馆又把原藏日本满铁图书馆的永乐大典五十二册送还我中央人民政府外交部。1955年德意志民主共和国格罗提渥总理访问我国时，把德国来比锡大学图书馆的永乐大典三册送还我中央人民政府。这三批永乐大典都先后拨交北京图书馆收藏。此外，1951年上海商务印书馆董事会也将该馆涵芬楼历年辛勤搜集的永乐大典二十一册，捐赠给北京图书馆，同年天津市周叔弢副市长和赵元方先生也将他们收藏的永乐大典各一册捐赠给北京图书馆。北京图书馆近年也有零星搜购。截至最近为止，北京图书馆收藏的永乐大典，包括北京大学图书馆移赠的四册在内，全数共达二百十四册。如果加上1954年中国科学院访苏代表团接受的苏联科学院移赠的永乐大典“梦”字韵一册，我们国家机关收藏的永乐大典，实达二百十五册。这个数字和1951年北京图书馆为了感谢苏联列宁格勒大学图书馆送还永乐大典举办“永乐大典展览”时所统计的数字，已有显著增长。那时国外各图书馆和私人收藏的永乐大典根据不完全的统计约有二百零七册，北京图书馆和国内其他图书馆以及私人收藏的永乐大典，包括南京解放前国民党反动集团劫往台湾的八册在内，约有一百六十余册。合计国内外图书馆和私人收藏的永乐大典，约有三百七十余册。现在北京图书馆收藏的永乐大典，已达二百十四册，各帝国主义国家图书馆和私人收藏的永乐大典已降到一百五十册左右。这是一桩多么令人高兴的事情啊！
    永乐大典本水经注，是水经注中一个比较出色的本子，它和传世残宋本、明代沈辨之旧藏的明抄本，同出一源。清代乾隆年间戴东原曾说他校的水经注，文字多据永乐大典订补。现在永乐大典本水经注，已由商务印书馆影印出版。戴东原利用赵一清全祖望校本中的成果，“假托”而非真的出自永乐大典，已由许多学者予以公认了。永乐大典本水经注除了可供戴校水经注翻案以外，它本身也有许多特点，可作比较研究。
    北京图书馆为了扩大科学研究起见，打算把永乐大典拍成显微胶卷，供应各大图书馆和研究机构作为进行科学研究的参考资料。
    同时，我恳切地盼望全国图书馆界，也要学习北京大学图书馆忘小我，立大我的精神，将馆藏检查一下，如果发现重要书籍，可以补配他馆之缺，应该通过协商，作出决定，让这些书籍早日“破镜重圆”。这对于图书馆的典藏，出版和科学研究工作，都是十分有利的。例如1176年（南宋淳熙三年）舒州（今安徽舒城）公使库刻的大易粹言，原藏故宫天禄琳琅，后来溥仪携赴长春伪宫，长春解放后，这部书一部分现藏北京故宫博物院，一部分现藏辽宁省立图书馆。舒州本大易粹言不但是研究哲学史的宝贵资料，也是物质文化史研究工作的重要标本。又如1134年（南宋绍兴四年）温州州学刻的大唐六典，现在北京图书馆、北京大学图书馆、南京博物院各有数卷，这三个单位藏本，都是元代崇文阁的藏书，原系一帙。希望有关单位通过协商，予以合理解决。
    总之，北京大学图书馆向北京图书馆移赠永乐大典本水经注这一事件，是全国图书馆界进行协作良好的开端，希望进一步发扬这种共产主义的协作精神。
