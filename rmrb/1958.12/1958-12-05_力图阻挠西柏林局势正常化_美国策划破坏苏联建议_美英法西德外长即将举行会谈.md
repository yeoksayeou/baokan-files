Xinhua News Agency, December 4th Dispatch from Washington: The Soviet proposal to transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city has thrown the Western countries into a frenzy. After days of intense consultations, Western news agencies have recently reported that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany will hold a meeting to discuss the Berlin issue. The meeting may take place in Paris before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting on December 16th.

At the same time, news from the capitals of the aforementioned four countries has consistently stated that they have drafted preliminary plans to reject the Soviet proposal. The purpose of this meeting is to provide so-called "final touches" to the Western "counter-proposals" regarding the Soviet proposal. This "counter-proposal" will disregard the fact that two German states with different social systems exist, and will advocate for a Four-Power conference to discuss the entire German question and the issue of so-called "free elections" in Germany. The obvious aim is to obstruct the normalization of the West Berlin situation, thereby continuing to allow West Berlin to exist as a malignant tumor.

A United Press International dispatch from Washington on December 2nd revealed the conspiratorial steps taken by Western countries to undermine the Soviet proposal and confirmed that this idea mainly originated from the US government. This news agency revealed that, according to the "preliminary draft (of the West) on the German question that is being formulated" in Washington, the West will propose a "counter-proposal" to the Soviet Union's proposal on the Berlin issue, advocating that the Berlin issue be considered from a so-called "comprehensive perspective," and that the Four Powers reconsider "the entire issue" of European security and German reunification. Reports indicate they want to use the Berlin issue to continue attempting to impose their will on the German people.

United Press International stated that this Western draft will be sent to Bonn next week and, after being agreed upon by the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, will be submitted to the Soviet Union in the latter half of December.

    力图阻挠西柏林局势正常化
    美国策划破坏苏联建议
    美英法西德外长即将举行会谈
    新华社4日讯  华盛顿消息：苏联提出的关于把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的建议使得西方国家手忙脚乱。在经过接连几天的紧张磋商以后，西方通讯社最近不断传出消息说，美、英、法和西德四国外交部长将举行会谈，讨论柏林问题。会谈可能在12月16日北大西洋集团理事会会议前在巴黎举行。
    和这同时，最近几天也不断从上述四国首都传出消息说，它们已经拟定拒绝接受苏联建议的初步计划，而这次会谈的目的就是要对西方就苏联建议将要提出的“反建议”进行所谓“最后润色”。这个“反建议”将无视存在着两个具有不同社会制度的德国的事实，而主张举行四大国会议讨论整个德国问题和在德国举行所谓“自由选举”问题。这样做，目的显然是要阻挠使西柏林局势正常化，从而继续使西柏林作为一个毒瘤存在下去。
    合众国际社2日从华盛顿发出的一条消息，就透露了西方国家企图破坏苏联建议的阴谋步骤。并且证实这一主意主要出自美国政府。这家通讯社透露，根据华盛顿“正在制定的（西方）关于德国问题的初步草案”，西方将对苏联关于柏林问题的建议提出一项“对抗建议”，主张从所谓“全面的观点”来考虑柏林问题，由四大国再次考虑欧洲安全和德国重新统一“这整个问题”。有消息说，它们想借柏林问题来继续设法把它们的意志强加在德国人头上。
    合众国际社说，西方的这一草案将在下周送交波恩，并且在经过北大西洋集团各国外长同意以后，在12月后半月向苏联提出。
