(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, December 22nd) In the short twenty days since the financial and trade institutions were decentralized, the Baiguo People's Commune in Macheng County, Hubei Province, vividly demonstrated that the people's commune can not only manage financial and trade work well, but also greatly show the superiority of the commune's management of financial and trade work.

The Baiguo People's Commune was established in September of this year by merging the original eight townships, one hundred and seven agricultural cooperatives, and two towns. In order to adapt to the profound changes in production, distribution, exchange, and consumption that occurred after the establishment of the commune, the Macheng County Party Committee, in mid-October, decentralized the state's commercial, grain, finance, and banking units, as well as joint state-private stores and cooperative stores within the scope of the Baiguo Commune, according to the spirit of the new financial and trade management system of "two releases" (releasing personnel and assets), "three unifications" (unified policy, unified planning, and unified management of working capital), and "one contract" (contracting fiscal tasks) to the commune for management. During this profound transformation, some cadres doubted whether the commune could lead well after the personnel and institutions were decentralized? Whether the state's various tax, procurement, and purchase tasks could be completed smoothly? Whether the Party Committee would attach importance to financial and trade work? They worried that the commune lacked experience and that it would be difficult to clean up if they messed up this situation. Even some cadres in the commune worried that it would be difficult to intervene.

What has the situation been like in the past twenty days? Financial and trade work has been twisted into a rope with the commune's industrial and agricultural production and other work, and a new, unprecedented and vibrant atmosphere has emerged. At the beginning of the decentralization work, the commune Party Committee incorporated financial and trade work into the current overall work plan of the commune. The commune established a financial and trade department, headed by a Party Committee secretary and two members, who were specifically responsible for the commune's financial and trade work. They also absorbed the heads of commercial, grain, and banking units to form a leading group responsible for the decentralization of this system and other related work in the future. In the first three days, more than 260,000 yuan of assets in various departments of the commune were cleared and handed over. When the commune cadres and the broad masses of commune members heard that the financial and trade institutions had been decentralized to their own commune, the difficult problems originally estimated in the asset inventory and handover - the agricultural cooperatives and commune members who had sold goods on credit to the supply and marketing department also returned the money one after another. The four brigades of Mingshan, Maxihe, and Jianguo sold more than 3,200 yuan on credit, and after the cadres took the lead, more than 2,400 yuan were returned within three days. The commune Party Committee then made nine regulations on the overall management of financial and trade work regarding the implementation of price policies, prohibition of sales on credit, and prohibition of private buying and selling outside the commune, calling on all cadres and commune members to jointly abide by and support them.

After the financial and trade institutions were decentralized to the commune, the enthusiasm of the commune was greatly brought into play. Recently, after the procurement tasks for local specialties and other sideline products were issued, the commune Party Committee convened a meeting of brigade general branch secretaries and brigade leaders. After tapping potential and finding tricks, a total of 23 ways to develop local specialties and sideline businesses closely integrated with current production were added, such as crushing ore, peeling cotton stalks, and making small tools. The original 280,000 yuan procurement plan for the fourth quarter formulated by the financial and trade departments jumped to 3 million yuan at once. In order to ensure the completion of the task, the commune Party Committee also appointed two members to personally handle the development of diversified operations and the key points of the acquisition of local specialties and waste products. More than 100 cadres throughout the commune led commune members in large, medium, and small teams to launch a climax of rushing to purchase local specialties and waste products and developing diversified economies.

In the past, there was a contradiction between the needs of the commercial departments and the agricultural cooperatives and commune members and the inability to connect supply well. With the decentralization of this system, it was also readily solved. In this year's large-scale deep plowing, the cadres of the commercial department promptly organized the masses to take materials locally and made more than 1,000 deep plowing plows for the commune in ten days, powerfully supporting the commune's deep plowing and winter planting production. In these recent days when the high tide of winter water conservancy construction is coming, these cadres are busy purchasing materials such as iron wire and ropes on the one hand, and organizing the masses to build lime kilns in a big way using local methods, striving to produce 2 million jin of lime this winter and next spring, so that it will be available whenever construction starts.

The decentralization of the system has also strengthened the commune's leadership over the original joint state-private stores, cooperative stores, and small vendors. In addition, after this rational adjustment during the decentralization, each department also drew more than 150 cadres and other personnel to support the production of agriculture, animal husbandry farms, and diversified operations within the commune. The enthusiasm of those who are still in their posts to participate in labor has also increased. Communist new people who are both cadres and workers, peasants, and laborers have begun to be cultivated in this commune.

(Our newspaper dispatch) After the grass-roots financial and trade units were decentralized to the commune, the Yangling People's Commune Party Committee in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, immediately took measures to strengthen the core leadership of the Party and actively carried out political and ideological education work, so that the thinking of the financial and trade personnel of this commune took a step forward compared with the past.

The grass-roots financial and trade units that have now been decentralized to the Yangling People's Commune include four units originally set up by the state in Yangling Town: the central store, the grain station, the tax office, and the People's Bank business office, as well as seven joint state-private sales departments and fourteen cooperative stores and groups that are also under the leadership of the commune, with a total of more than 300 financial and trade personnel. Before the decentralization, the grass-roots Party organizations were very unsound. Except for the establishment of branches in the central store and the grain station, no Party organizations had been established at the grass-roots level in other units, and only the former Yangling Town General Branch Committee of the CPC provided general leadership. Therefore, the political and ideological work of the financial and trade personnel was weak. Problems such as uneasiness about work, making trouble for fame and status, and disunity occurred among the financial and trade personnel, and individual financial and trade cadres also committed embezzlement. Some people in the private sector have also secretly engaged in illegal business activities.

In order to do a good job in the decentralization of financial and trade institutions, the Yangling People's Commune Committee of the CPC first took measures to strengthen the absolute leadership of the Party. The commune Party Committee established branches or jointly established branches in all grass-roots financial and trade units. It also sent full-time cadres to serve as branch secretaries in the two larger branches of the store and the grain station. The political and ideological work of all private personnel, cooperative members, and vendors is under the leadership of the commune store Party branch. The commune Party Committee discusses financial and trade work once a month, and the secretary in charge convenes two financial and trade work inspection meetings every half month.

After the commune Party Committee improved the Party's organization, it first educated the financial and trade personnel on the various confused ideas about improving the financial and trade system. The Party Committee organized employees to debate on topics such as "the nature and future of the people's commune," "how grass-roots financial and trade units should adapt to the communization movement," and "how to do a good job in financial and trade work with the attitude of the commune's masters after decentralization," so as to unify and improve the ideological understanding of financial and trade employees. For example, many financial and trade personnel originally thought that after the institutions were decentralized, they had "dropped from a state cadre to a commune member." Through debate, they realized that they were "both cadres and commune members of the people's commune" and felt very honored.

In the debate through typical criticism, the commune Party Committee also exposed and struggled against illegal activities such as private personnel taking advantage of the decentralization to engage in withdrawing funds, transferring tools, and stealing goods. In addition, individual commercial personnel believed that after the commercial institutions were decentralized, "in the future, slow-moving goods and defective goods can be mobilized by commune members to purchase," and "less cotton can be sold to the state, and more can be left to the commune store, so that more money can be made." Capitalist business ideas have also been seriously criticized.

The commune Party Committee used the achievements and superiority of the grass-roots financial and trade units after decentralization to improve the ideological understanding of the financial and trade personnel who theoretically understood the benefits of decentralization but still had concerns about certain practical problems through symposiums and other methods. In the past, some people suspected that the commune did not lead financial and trade work well, worried that the commune would draw people to do central work, which would affect business, and worried that the superior commercial institutions would not be flexible in transferring goods after the stores were decentralized, and that the store sales departments would not have confidence in completing the plan after independent operation. Now, these worries have been swept away. It is generally believed that after the direct leadership of the commune Party Committee, the financial and trade tasks are completed faster and better than in the past. The commune Party Committee's unified transfer of people to engage in the large-scale collection and purchase movement has accelerated the progress of procurement. Because the commune stores are more aware of market changes, the superior commercial institutions have been bolder in allocating goods than before. For example, before September, the purchasing station only collected more than 10,000 jin of waste copper and iron per month on average. In October, the commune Party Committee transferred more than 40 financial and trade personnel to jointly carry out procurement work, and they collected more than 11,000 jin in three days. Zhang Youliang of the commune store originally worried that after the store was decentralized, the relationship with the superior commercial department would be weak, and the transfer of goods would not be flexible. Once, he applied to the superior for 700 meters of power belt, an increase of two or three times compared with the past, but the superior learned that the Yangling Commune needed a large amount of power ginned cotton for refitting and fully met the requirements. Because the commune Party Committee gradually solved the ideological problems of the financial and trade personnel, the idea of "taking the commune as home" is growing. For example, in October, the grain station averaged 1,000 bags of grain transported out every day. The transportation and loading of goods from the warehouse to the train were all done by all the financial and trade personnel in shifts in their spare time. They said: It's better to save a little when doing things for our own commune. (Attached picture)

After the grass-roots financial and trade institutions in the Shahe area of Taigu County, Shanxi Province, were decentralized and managed by the commune, the salespersons tried every means to meet the needs of the commune. This is them taking cigarettes and small general merchandise to sell in the fields.

    农村财贸工作基础在公社 
    白果人民公社生产活跃、供应改善，证明财贸机构下放无比优
    越杨陵人民公社党委加强思想、业务领导，完成财贸任务又快又好
    本报武汉22日电  湖北省麻城县白果人民公社在财贸机构下放后的短短二十天中，生动地说明了人民公社不仅能够管理好财贸工作，而且大大地显示出公社管理财贸工作的优越性。
    白果人民公社是今年9月间由原来八个乡一百零七个农业社和两个镇合并建成的。为了适应公社建立后生产、分配、交换和消费等方面所发生的深刻变化，中共麻城县委在10月中旬把国家在白果公社范围内的商业、粮食、财政、银行等单位以及公私合营商店、合作商店等都根据两放（放人员和资产）、三统（统一政策、统一计划和统一流动资金的管理），一包（包财政任务）的新的财贸管理体制的精神，下放给公社管理。在这次富有深刻意义的变革中，有些干部却怀疑人员、机构下放后，公社能否领导好？国家的各种税收、采购和征购等任务能否顺利完成？党委是否重视财贸工作？他们担心公社缺乏经验，搞乱了这摊子就不好收拾。就是在公社的部分干部中也发愁不好插手。
    二十天来的情况怎样呢？财贸工作和公社工农业生产以及其他工作拧成了一股绳，出现了前所未有的生气勃勃的新气象。下放工作一开始，这个公社党委就把财贸工作纳入当前全社工作计划里。公社成立了财贸部，由一个党委书记和两个委员专门负责全社的财贸工作，并且吸收商业、粮食和银行等单位的负责人成立领导小组，负责这次体制下放和今后有关其他工作。在短短的头三天中，社内各部门二十六万多元的资产就清理接交完毕。社干部和广大社员们听说财贸机构下放到自己社里后，原来估计清产接交中的困难问题——农业社和社员们向供销部赊销的款项也纷纷归还了。明山、马溪河和建国等四个大队赊销三千二百多元，经过干部们一带头，三天之内就还了二千四百多元。公社党委接着又作出了关于执行价格政策、不准赊销和禁止社外私自买卖等全盘管理财贸工作的九项规定，号召全社干部和社员们共同遵守和支持。
    财贸机构下放到公社以后，大大发挥了公社的积极性。最近土特产品和其他副产品采购任务下达后，公社党委就召开大队总支书记和大队长会议，经过挖潜力、找窍门，一共增加了捶矿石、剥棉秆皮和做小工具等二十三项密切结合当前生产的土特产和副业的门路。原来财贸部门制订的第四季度二十八万元采购计划，一下就跃升到三百万元。为了保证任务的完成，公社党委又指定两个委员亲自搞一个发展多种经营和土特产、废品收购重点。全社一百多个干部在大、中、小队中领导社员掀起一个突击收购土特产、废品和开展多种经济的高潮。
    过去商业部门和农业社、社员存在需要和供应不能很好衔接的矛盾，随着这次体制下放也迎刃而解了。这个社在今年大搞深耕中，商业部门的干部就及时组织群众，就地取材，十天中为公社赶制了一千多部深耕犁，有力地支援了全社的深耕冬播生产。在冬修水利高潮即将到来的最近这些日子里，这些干部们又在一面忙着采购铁丝、绳索等器材，一面组织群众采用土办法大搞石灰窑，争取今冬明春生产石灰二百万斤，作到动工后随到随有。
    体制下放还使得这个公社对原来的公私合营商店、合作商店和小商贩的领导也随着加强了。另外，全社经过这次下放中的合理调整，各部门还抽出一百五十多个干部和其他人员支援社内农业、畜牧场和多种经营三方面的生产。仍在工作岗位上的人员，参加劳动的积极性也增长了。既是干部又是工人农民劳动者的共产主义新人，开始在这个社里培养起来了。
    本报讯  陕西省武功县杨陵人民公社党委在基层财贸单位下放到公社后，立即采取措施加强党的核心领导，积极地开展政治思想教育工作，使这个公社财贸人员的思想较前提高了一步。
    现已下放给杨陵人民公社的基层财贸单位，有国家原设在杨陵镇的中心商店、粮站、税务所和人民银行营业所等四个单位，以及同时划归公社领导的七个公私合营门市部、十四个合作商店和小组等，共有三百多个财贸人员。在下放前，基层党组织很不健全，除了中心商店和粮站各成立支部外，其他单位都没有建立党的基层组织，仅由原中共杨陵镇总支委员会作一般性的领导。因此，就形成财贸人员政治思想工作薄弱，在财贸人员当中曾发生不安心工作、闹名誉地位、闹不团结等问题，个别财贸干部还发生了贪污行为。在私方人员中也曾有人暗中做非法经营活动。
    为了做好财贸机构下放工作，中共杨陵人民公社委员会首先采取措施，健全党的绝对领导。公社党委在各基层财贸单位都建立了支部或联合建立了支部，在商店和粮站两个较大的支部，还派去专职干部担任支部书记。所有私方人员、合作社员、摊贩的政治思想工作，都受公社商店党支部的领导。公社党委每月讨论一次财贸工作，每半月由专管书记召集两次财贸工作检查会。
    公社党委在健全党的组织以后，首先对财贸人员中存在的关于改进财贸体制的各种糊涂思想进行教育。党委以“人民公社的性质和前途”，“基层财贸单位如何适应公社化运动”，“下放后怎样以公社主人翁的态度做好财贸工作”等内容，组织职工辩论，统一和提高了财贸职工的思想认识。例如不少财贸人员原来认为机构下放后，自己
  “从一个国家干部降成一个公社社员”，通过辩论，认识到自己“又是干部，又是人民公社的社员”，并且感到非常光荣。
    在辩论中通过典型批判，公社党委同时还对私方人员乘下放之机，从事抽资金、转移工具、偷商品等违法行为，进行了揭露和斗争。此外个别商业人员认为商业机构下放后，“将来有冷滞货和残次货都可动员社员购买”，“棉花少卖些给国家，多留些给公社商店，可以多赚钱”等资本主义经营思想，也受到严肃的批判。
    公社党委对一些从理论上懂了下放的好处、而对某些实际问题还有顾虑的财贸人员，则用基层财贸单位下放后取得的成绩和优越性，通过座谈等方式提高他们的思想认识。过去有人怀疑公社领导不好财贸工作，担心公社抽人搞中心工作会影响业务，顾虑商店下放后上级商业机构调货物不灵便，商店门市部独立经营后对计划完成没信心等。现在，这些顾虑都一扫而光，普遍认为公社党委直接领导后，财贸任务完成得比过去更快更好，公社党委统一抽调人搞大收大购运动，反而加速了收购进度；上级商业机构因公社商店更了解市场变化情况，调拨货物较前更大胆了，如收购站9月前收购废铜铁每月平均只收一万多斤，10月份公社党委共抽出四十多名财贸人员共同进行收购工作，三天时间就收了一万一千多斤。公社商店的张友良，原来担心商店下放后，就和上级商业部门关系淡薄了，调货物也不会灵便了。有一次他向上级申请七百公尺动力带，数量比过去增加二、三倍，但上级了解到杨陵公社改装动力轧花车需用量大，全部满足了要求。因为公社党委逐渐解决了财贸人员的思想问题，所以“以公社为家”的思想正在成长。例如10月份粮站每天平均外调一千包粮食，由仓库到火车上的搬运和装车工作，都是全部财贸人员轮流在业余时间干的。他们说：给自己公社办事，省一点好一点。（附图片）
    山西省太谷县沙河地区的基层财贸机构下放归公社管理以后，营业员想尽一切办法来满足社里的需要。这是他们带着纸烟和小百货到地头去卖。
