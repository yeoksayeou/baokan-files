    Promote the Mass Line and the Style of Seeking Truth from Facts:
    Cadres in Gaotang County Strive to Implement Ten Requirements to Further Strengthen Ties Between Cadres and the Masses
    (Our Dispatch) After the Gaotang County Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward ten requirements based on promoting the mass line and the spirit of seeking truth from facts, adhering to the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit, it promoted the further transformation of the work style of cadres throughout the county and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses.
    After the rectification movement, the ideological awareness level and the style of contacting the masses of all cadres in Gaotang County have been greatly improved. In their work, they have greatly promoted the spirit of hard work and practical work, and have worked, lived, and labored with the masses. As a result, they have driven the people of the whole county to achieve great achievements in various constructions.
    In order to further promote this excellent style and prevent the emergence of formalism and exaggeration, the Gaotang County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently put forward the following ten requirements to all cadres in the county: First, work hard and practically, and seek truth from facts; second, be modest and sincere, and don't be arrogant and complacent; third, consult with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and don't be self-righteous and act arbitrarily; fourth, listen to the Party; fifth, be arduous and simple, and don't be extravagant and wasteful; sixth, be collectivist; seventh, cherish public property; eighth, be bold in creation, and don't stick to conventions; ninth, care about the lives of the masses, and don't be divorced from the masses; tenth, eat, live, and labor with the masses, and don't just talk and not act.
    In order to specifically implement the above ten requirements, the county party committee decided that the county government cadres should go to the communes in batches and take turns to be commune members, and the cadres below the commune battalion level should bear certain production tasks like the commune members; the commune cadres should go to the production team canteen to eat. In terms of work methods, debate should be held on everything, facts should be presented, reasons should be explained, democracy should be fully promoted, and every task must make the commune members understand why to do it, how to do it, and to what extent it should be done.
    The requirements put forward by the county party committee have been enthusiastically supported by the vast number of cadres in the county. Starting from the secretary of the county party committee, they took the lead in implementing them. Xing Jinling and Zhang Houji, secretaries of the county party committee, personally led more than 350 cadres from the county government and communes to form a mass life visiting group. Since the beginning of November, they have gone deep into the mass canteens, homes for the elderly, nurseries, and kindergartens for visits three times, found problems, and solved them on the spot.
    Under the influence of the county party committee, cadres of various communes also held small-scale forums, old peasant forums, red and expert activists forums, brainstorming sessions, and on-site meetings everywhere, humbly listened to the opinions of the masses, mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and ideas, exchanged experiences, and promoted production. Wang Zhaogui, a company instructor of Chengguan Commune, personally visited commune members. Li Ping'an, secretary of the Yinji Commune Party Committee, while leading commune members in the Tianzhai Management Area to pick cotton, not only explained the truth to the masses, but also personally led the commune members to work practically. Under his leadership, 900 commune members picked cotton on 7,200 mu in five days, and the labor efficiency increased by 25% compared with before. The commune members said happily: "If the leaders can go into the sea, we can capture the dragon. With the cadres and the masses united, we can be the vanguard in all kinds of work." When Jiangdian Commune was rushing to harvest the remaining autumn crops, the initial general deployment was slow. Later, the secretary of the Party Committee personally led the cadres to pick up a lot of missed corn in the two mu of harvested cornfield in Xindian Production Team. They exhibited these corns and other picked crops together, so that battalion and company cadres could visit and discuss. As a result, the whole commune quickly took action. Within two days, it collected more than 2,400 jin of residual cotton, more than 100,600 jin of grain, more than 3,000 jin of peanuts, more than 35,000 jin of vegetables, and 1.89 million jin of firewood.
    The further transformation of the cadres' work style greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the masses. The "three fasts" appeared among the masses, that is, fast gathering, fast work, and fast improvement of work efficiency.

    发扬群众路线和实事求是作风 
    高唐县干部努力实行十项要求，进一步密切干群关系
    本报讯  中共山东高唐县委依据发扬群众路线的作风和实事求是的精神，坚持革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则，提出十项要求后，推动全县干部进一步转变了作风，密切了干群关系。
    经过整风运动之后，高唐县全体干部的思想觉悟水平和联系群众的作风都有很大的提高。在工作中大大地发扬了苦干实干的精神，在作风上作到了与群众同吃同住同劳动。因而带动全县人民，在各项建设中取得了巨大成就。
    中共高唐县委为了进一步发扬这种优良作风，并防止形式主义和浮夸现象的产生，最近在全县干部中，提出：第一、要苦干实干，实事求是；第二、要虚心诚恳，不要骄傲自满；第三、要和群众商量，倾听群众意见，不要自以为是，独断专行；第四、要听党的话；第五、要艰苦朴素，不要铺张浪费；第六、要集体主义；第七、要爱护公共财产；第八、要大胆创造，不要墨守陈规；第九、要关心群众生活，不要脱离群众；第十、要和群众同吃同住同劳动，不要光说不作。
    为了具体贯彻上述十项要求，县委确定县机关干部要分批轮流到公社当社员，公社营以下的干部，要与社员同样负担一定的生产任务；公社干部要深入生产队食堂吃饭。在工作方法上，事事抓辩论，摆事实，讲道理，充分发扬民主，每一件工作必须使社员明白为什么干，怎样干，干到什么程度。
    县委提出的要求，受到全县广大干部的热烈拥护，从县委书记起，首先以身作则，带头贯彻执行。县委书记邢金岭、张厚基等同志，亲自率领县机关和公社干部三百五十多名，组成群众生活访问团，从11月初，先后三次深入到群众食堂、敬老院、托儿所、幼儿园进行访问，发现问题，就地解决。
    各公社干部在县委的影响下，也到处召开小型座谈会、老农座谈会、红专积极分子座谈会、献计会、现场会，虚心听取群众意见，发动群众献计献策，交流经验，促进生产。城关公社连指导员王兆贵，亲自登门访问社员。尹集公社党委书记李平安在领导田寨管理区社员拾棉时，一面和群众讲透道理，一面亲自带领社员实干，九百名社员在他的带动下，五天拾棉花七千二百亩，劳动效率比以前提高25％。社员们高兴地说：“领导能下海，我们能擒龙，干部群众一条心，各项工作打先锋。”姜店公社在突击收残秋时，开始一般布置，进度很慢，后来党委书记亲自带领干部，在辛店生产队二亩已收的玉米地里，拾起不少漏收的玉米，他们便把这些玉米和拣到的其他作物一块展览，让营连干部参观讨论。这样作的结果，全社很快行动起来，两天内共收残棉二千四百多斤，拣收粮食十万零六千余斤，花生三千余斤，蔬菜三万五千余斤，柴草一百八十九万斤。
    干部作风进一步的转变，大大地鼓舞了群众的积极性，在群众中出现了“三快”，即集合快、干活快、工效提高的快。
