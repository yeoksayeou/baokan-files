Taking Care of Children is More Important Than Managing Tractors
	Dai Jiazhang

	I have been dealing with nurseries and kindergartens for many years. Every time I pick up my children on weekends, I always have an irrepressible feeling of surprise and joy. Look, they have grown taller and become more sensible in just one week. Seeing the children grow up healthier and more lively, like flowers, thriving, I can't help but think: Who has put in the most effort and hard work here? Not the parents, but the nursery workers and educators. Thanks to them, how much effort and energy have parents saved? Mothers probably feel this even more deeply. One mother once said: "The achievements I have made in my work also include a share from the nannies!" Indeed, how many mothers in the past were unable to participate in social work because they had to take care of their children. Now, countless nurseries and kindergartens have been established, and the labor of taking care of children has been transformed from individual to collective. How many mothers have been able to break free and take up social work positions because of this. Therefore, it is only natural for mothers to shout: "Glory to the nannies!"

	However, the significance of childcare and education work is actually much more profound. What they are nurturing and educating is not just my child or your child, but the next generation of the entire country, the successors to socialist construction. They have taken on this heavy burden with all their strength, which guarantees that we, the parents, especially the mothers, can free up sufficient time and energy to build socialism without any worries. What a meaningful job! "You have worked hard, thank you!" Chairman Mao's words express the sentiments of all parents and the people of the whole country!

	Our children account for one-fifth of the population of six hundred million. To make this large number of the next generation become new people with a communist style from an early age, how important is the task of nursery workers and educators! Comrade Liu Shaoqi said during his inspection in Henan: "Taking care of children should be more important than managing tractors and water pumps." Comrade Deng Xiaoping also said during his inspection in Hebei: "The work of taking care of children should be greatly developed. One-fifth of the people are under their care. Therefore, the position of nursery workers is very important. It is necessary to select a group of members of the Communist Youth League and activists, train them, and let them specialize in childcare work." Now, the vast majority of comrades who have already taken up or will take up this position recognize the great significance of their responsibilities, so they are very happy even though their work is hard. But I have also seen individual comrades working hard but unhappily. She underestimates herself, looks down on her own work, but always says that others look down on her work. Of course, there are indeed a few parents who do not respect them enough and have a bad attitude, often criticizing more than helping, which should be corrected. In this regard, childcare workers should analyze and counter-criticize, and do not need to feel depressed because of this. Because most parents are very grateful to you and are willing to do their best to help you take good care of your children.

	As a parent myself, I have had deep experiences, so I can't help but loudly and enthusiastically praise the nursery workers, educators, and their labor. I see that the nannies and teachers all have a heart of "loving my children and extending it to other people's children," and they are often more careful and principled in educating their children than parents. They are more able to set an example in front of the children. These are also worth learning for parents. Therefore, it can be said that they are not only educating the next generation, but also educating the older generation. What a noble job!

    管孩子比管拖拉机更重要
    戴嘉章
    我跟托儿所、幼儿园打交道多年了，每逢周末去接孩子，总有一种抑止不住的惊异和高兴的心情。瞧，才一周不见，孩子们又长高了许多，懂事了许多。眼看孩子们一个个出落得越来越健康、活泼，花朵似的，欣欣向荣，不禁想道：这里头，谁付出了最多的心血和劳累？不是父母，而是保育员同志，教养员同志。仰仗了她们，父母们少费了多少精力，省却了多少功夫？这一点，怕是母亲们的感触更深。有位母亲就曾说过：“我在工作上得到的成绩，里面也有阿姨们的一份！”的确，从前有多少母亲就因为要看孩子而没法参加社会工作。如今，办起了无数托儿所、幼儿园，看孩子的劳动由个体的变成了集体的，多少母亲因此而脱身出来，走上社会工作的岗位。因此，母亲们喊出：“光荣归于阿姨们！”是很自然的事。
    然而，保育、教养工作的意义，实际还要深远得多。她们所培育、教养的，不单是我的孩子或你的孩子，而是整个祖国的下一代，社会主义建设的接班人。她们全力挑起了这付重担，就保证了我们父母这一代人，尤其是母亲们，可以腾出充足的时间和精力去建设社会主义而无后顾之忧。这是多么有意思的工作！“你们辛苦了，谢谢你们！”毛主席这句话，道出了全体父母、全国人民的心意！
    我们的儿童人数占到六亿人口的五分之一。要使这为数众多的下一代人从小就养成共产主义风格的新人，保育员、教养员的任务有多么重大！刘少奇同志在河南视察时说过：“管孩子应当比管拖拉机、抽水机更重要。”邓小平同志在视察河北时也说：“管娃娃这一行还要大大发展，五分之一的人归她们管，因此，保育员的地位十分重要。要选拔一批共青团员和积极分子，加以训练，使她们专做保育工作。”现在，已经走上或将走上这个岗位的同志，绝大多数是认识到自己职责的重大意义的，因此工作虽然辛苦，却很愉快。但是我也见过个别同志工作得辛苦而不愉快。她妄自菲薄，自己看不起自己的工作，却总道是人家看不起她的工作。当然，确实也有少数家长对她们不够尊重，态度不好，往往责难多于帮助，这是应该加以纠正的。对此，保育工作者应该加以分析和反批评，不必因此而情绪低落。因为大多数家长是非常感激你们，而且愿意极力协助你们带好孩子的。
    我自己作为家长，有过深切的体会，所以总是禁不住要大声地、热烈地歌颂保育员、教养员以及他们的劳动的。我看出阿姨们老师们都具有一付“幼我幼以及人之幼”的心肠，而且她们往往比父母教养自己的孩子更加细心更加有原则性，她们在孩子面前更加能以身作则。这些也值得父母们学习。因此可以说，她们不仅教养着下一代，也教育着上一代。多么崇高的工作！
