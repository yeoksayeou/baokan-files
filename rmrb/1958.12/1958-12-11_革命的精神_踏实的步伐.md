Revolutionary Spirit, Solid Steps
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Many regions have already begun implementing the "basic farmland" system, gradually changing from extensive planting with low yields to intensive planting with high yields. This marks the beginning of a new stage of development in China's agricultural production.

Implementing the "basic farmland" system requires reducing a portion of cultivated land to concentrate manpower and various means of production. This contradicts the rough farming system that people have been accustomed to for thousands of years. Precisely because of this, some people are still hesitant about intensive planting with high yields, feeling that "planting more is always safer than planting less," and therefore are not very willing to return some cultivated land to fallow. This shows that these people's minds have not yet been liberated, and they do not clearly understand the new situation in China's agricultural production. We advocate intensive planting with high yields today with a reliable foundation. After the efforts of 1958, not only have countless small-area, high-yield "satellites" with per-mu yields of tens of thousands of jin of grain appeared all over the country, but also many large-area, high-yield fields with per-mu yields of thousands of jin of grain have emerged. The conditions for preventing natural disasters are becoming more and more favorable, the measures for increasing production are becoming more and more specific, and the experiences for increasing production are becoming more and more abundant. On this basis, is not intensive planting with high yields able to increase production even more than extensive planting with low yields? At the same time, according to this year's agricultural production level and development speed, the people's needs for grain can soon be met.

We affirm that the policy of intensive planting with high yields must be adhered to, and the "basic farmland" system must be actively promoted, but this does not mean that such a fundamental reform of the farming system can be realized all at once. Therefore, it is inappropriate for some comrades to attempt to reduce too much cultivated land at once without analyzing the specific conditions of their locality. The reform of the farming system should have a gradual process. The area of cultivated land can only be gradually reduced as the level of production increases.

The most important thing here is to conduct a concrete analysis of the local conditions in a realistic manner. The conditions in the south and the north, mountainous areas and plains, are different: the soil varies in quality, the population density varies in size, and the multiple cropping index varies in height. Since the specific conditions in various places are different, the steps and methods for implementing intensive planting with high yields should also be different. For example, in areas with a large population and little land and a high multiple cropping index, intensive planting with high yields should first gradually reduce the multiple cropping index as the yield per unit area increases, and not first reduce the area of cultivated land. In short, since 1959 is only the first year of implementing intensive planting with high yields, everyone lacks experience in the relevant arrangements for intensive planting with high yields. Therefore, it is still necessary to take more steady steps in promoting the farming system of intensive planting with high yields. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that in implementing the "basic farmland" system, it is necessary to actively promote it and gradually realize it, and also add a little "insurance coefficient" outside the "basic farmland" to expand the planting of non-basic farmland, so that the accelerated development of agricultural production in the province is placed on a more solid and reliable foundation.

From the promotion of this new farming system of intensive planting with high yields, we can realize that Marxists must combine revolutionary drive with a pragmatic and scientific spirit in dealing with any of their undertakings. We dare to break with the farming system of extensive planting with low yields that has been followed for thousands of years and the habits in this regard, and start implementing the farming system of intensive planting with high yields that no one has ever implemented before. This fully demonstrates the revolutionary style of our Communists who dare to think and dare to act, and dare to break with old conventions and habits. In the actual implementation of this reform, we must also be calm-headed, deliberate deeply, and formulate the steps and methods of advancement properly according to the specific conditions in all aspects. In this way, we can avoid undue deviations and setbacks in the work process and make us stand in an invincible position. The work of reforming the farming system is like this, and so is other work.

    革命的精神  踏实的步伐
    本报评论员
    许多地区已经开始实行“基本农田”制度，逐步改变广种薄收为少种多收。这标志着我国的农业生产开始进入了一个新的发展阶段。
    实行“基本农田”制，就要缩减一部分耕地面积，以便集中使用人力和各种生产资料。这是同几千年来人们习惯了的粗糙的耕作制度相矛盾的。正是因为这样，现在还有些人对于少种多收缩手缩脚，他们觉得“多种总比少种保险”，因此不大愿意退耕部分耕地。这说明这些人的思想还没有解放，对我国农业生产的新形势还认识不清。我们今天提倡少种多收，是有可靠基础的。经过1958年的努力，全国各地不但出现了无数块亩产粮食上万斤以至几万斤的小面积高产“卫星”，而且出现了很多亩产粮食上千斤以至几千斤的大面积高产田。防御自然灾害的条件越来越有利，增产措施越来越具体，增产经验越来越丰富。在这样的基础上实行少种多收，难道不是比广种薄收能更大地增产吗？同时，按照今年农业生产水平和发展速度，人民对粮食的需要，很快可以得到满足。
    我们肯定少种多收的方针必须坚持，“基本农田”制度必须积极推行，但是这并不是说，这样一个根本性的耕作制度的改革，一下子就实现。因此，有些同志不分析本地的具体条件，企图一下子缩减过多的耕地面积，是不妥当的。耕作制度的改革应当有一个逐步前进的过程。随着生产水平的提高，才可以逐渐缩小耕地面积。
    这里最重要的对本地各方面的条件实事求是地进行具体的分析。南方和北方、山区和平原，条件各有不同：土壤有好坏，人口密度有大小，复种指数有高低，这些条件也因地而异。既然各地具体条件不同，实行少种多收的步骤和方法也应当有所不同。例如在人多地少、复种指数很高的地区实行少种多收，应当首先随着单位面积产量的提高而逐步降低复种指数，而不能首先缩小耕地面积。总之，由于1959年还只是实行少种多收的第一年，大家对于有关少种多收的安排还缺乏经验，因此在推行少种多收的耕作制度中把步子放稳一些，还是必要的。中共山西省委决定，在贯彻“基本农田”制度当中，既要积极推广，又要逐步实现，并且在“基本农田”之外又加上一点“保险系数”，再扩大种植非基本农田耕地，这样就把全省农业生产的加速发展放在更加稳固可靠的基础上。
    从推行少种多收这一新耕作制度中，我们可以体会到一点，就是马克思主义者对待自己的任何事业，都须要把革命干劲和实事求是的科学精神结合起来。我们敢于同数千年来沿袭下来的广种薄收的耕作制度和这方面的习惯势力决裂，开始实行从来没有人实行过的少种多收的耕作制度，这充分表现了我们共产党人敢想敢干、敢于打破陈规旧习的革命风格；而在实际贯彻这种改革的时候，我们又要头脑冷静，深思熟虑，根据各方面的具体条件妥善地制订前进的步骤和方法，这样就可以避免工作过程中不应有的偏差和挫折，使我们立于不败之地。改革耕作制度的工作如此，其他工作也是如此。
