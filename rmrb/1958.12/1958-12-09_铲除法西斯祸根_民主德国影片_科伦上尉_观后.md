Eradicating the Root of Fascism
——After Watching the East German Film "Captain Kölln"
Li Shaobai

At a time when people still vividly remember the heinous crimes of German fascism, the US imperialism and the West German government, disregarding the world's people's desire for peace, are cultivating the forces of German militarism again: Fascists hold important positions in West German government agencies, old militarist organizations are breeding again, and generals are singing praises to "the success of Hitler's army" and "the spirit of Prussia."

Based on this fact, East German filmmakers shot "Captain Kölln," a film with the theme of exposing the revival of West German militarism. The author's great political enthusiasm and superb artistic skills endow the film with extremely profound and realistic social significance, making it a powerful weapon for exposing and striking at the enemy.

An unemployed hotel waiter, due to a coincidence in name, is mistaken for Albert Kölln, a fascist army captain on the list of war criminals, and is valued by the West German monopoly group, suddenly becoming a popular figure in political circles. Later, the "amnesty law" was passed, the real Albert appeared, and the matter was exposed. The fake captain was sent to court because he could not find a "military crime" for self-defense and could not be dealt with according to the "amnesty law," so he was sentenced to five years in prison.

"Captain Kölln" is like a dagger, sharply dissecting the surface of West German society, allowing you to see through its truth at a glance. From the grassroots organizations of West Germany, which one is not opening the back door for war criminals according to the will of the monopoly group? Fascist officers hold banquets, sing Nazi war songs, and shout that their enemy is "those stubborn civilians who demand peace all day long"; and such a fascist gathering is valued by the mayor. The West German ruling group appointed the fake captain as "Head of Personnel" and then asked him to be a "Member of Parliament"; he unintentionally made cannons out of chocolate, but they regarded it as an "amazing political sense," because it conformed to the monopoly group's original intention to launch wars and plunder. Hitler's marshals, ostensibly locked in prisons, are actually painstakingly working to launch an atomic war there! After the parliament, the monopoly capitalist group passed a "bill" to pardon war criminals, and those executioners stained with the blood of the people are again working hard to fill the pockets of the financial group bosses. Here, the life surface the author reveals to us is so broad: from the lower-level fascist officers to their generals and marshals, from the West German government agencies to the reactionary factions in the parliament, from the war criminals to the imperialist monopoly groups, the complex relationships between them are all displayed; at the same time, it is also revealed that whether it is the parliament or government agencies, whether it is the mayor, war criminals, or the leaders of the reactionary parliamentary parties, they are all just tools of the monopoly group, all serving the interests of the monopoly group. Here, the author excellently uses the expressive means of satirical art, every plot and every scene is full of sharp ridicule and merciless criticism of the enemy!

The film not only exposes the criminal activities of the West German ruling group, but also truly depicts the magnificent struggle of the West German working class and people against the revival of militarism: the masses of workers, at the meeting to welcome the chairman of the board, sing loudly: "We will not be fooled again, we have suffered enough..."; when the war criminal Kaesmayr was released, tens of thousands of people held angry demonstrations, forcing this dignified marshal to change into the clothes of an elevator worker and sneak away like a rat crossing the street. These plots illustrate the author's infinite trust in the power of the people, which is a distinct feature of socialist art.

Art must have clear political content and prominent and vivid characters, only in this way can it have attractive charm and receive better educational results. The author of this film also shows their talent in this regard. The image of the fake Captain Albert is portrayed very well! His every word and deed, every move, matches the identity of the character. The profession of a high-end hotel waiter allows him to understand everything about the customs and life of the upper class bourgeoisie; he is muddledly used by others, but he is still a kind person after all. His personality characteristics and professional characteristics are expressed so vividly here, and other characters are also well portrayed.

With great political enthusiasm, East German filmmakers take the exposure of West German revival of militarism and the prevention of new war threats as an important task in self-defense artistic activities, and have produced "Captain Kölln" and other excellent films with realistic significance. These films have promoted the people's struggle against the revival of militarism. For the peace-loving Chinese people, these films will also receive great attention and a warm welcome.

    铲除法西斯祸根
    ——民主德国影片“科伦上尉”观后
    李少白
    在人们对于德国法西斯滔天罪行记忆犹新的时候，美帝国主义和西德的政府，却无视全世界人民的和平愿望，又在培植德国军国主义势力：法西斯分子在西德政府机构中充任要职，旧日的军国主义组织又在滋生，将军们又在为“希特勒军队的成功”和“普鲁士的精神”高唱赞歌。
    民主德国的电影工作者根据这个事实，拍摄了这部以揭露西德军国主义复活为主题的影片“科伦上尉”。作者巨大的政治热情，出色的艺术技巧，赋予影片以极其深刻极其现实的社会意义，使它成为暴露敌人、打击敌人的有力武器。
    一个失业的饭店招待，由于名字的巧合，被误认为是名列战犯的法西斯陆军上尉阿尔培特受到西德垄断集团的重视，一下子成了政界的红人。后来，“大赦法案”通过，真阿尔培特出现了，事情才被拆穿，假上尉被送上法庭，因为他找不出自卫的“军事罪行”，不能按“大赦法案”办理，而被判处徒刑五年。
    “科伦上尉”形同一把匕首，锐利地剖开了西德社会的表皮，让你一视无遗地看透了它的真相。从西德的基层机构起，那一个不在按着垄断集团的意志为战犯敞开后门呢？法西斯军官大摆宴席，高唱纳粹战歌，叫着他们的敌人就是“那些一天到晚要求和平的顽固不化的平民”；而就是这样一个法西斯集会，却受到了市长的重视。西德的统治集团任命假上尉当“人事处长”，又叫他当“国会议员”；他无意中用巧克力做了大炮，却被他们视为是“惊人的政治嗅觉”，因为这符合了垄断集团发动战争进行掠夺的本意。希特勒的元帅，表面上是被关在监牢里，而实际上他们却正在那里为发动一场原子战争而煞费苦心！垄断资本集团在议会后，通过了一项大赦战犯的“法案”，那些沾满人民鲜血的刽子手，又在为装满财团老板的腰包而奔波效劳了。这里，作者揭示给我们的生活面是如此的广阔：从法西斯的下级军官到他们的将军、元帅，从西德的政府机构到议院的反动党团，从战争罪犯到帝国主义垄断集团，他们之间的复杂关系都得到展现；同时，还揭示出：无论是议会或是政府机构，无论是市长、战犯或是议会反动党派的头目，都不过是垄断集团的工具，都是为垄断集团的利益服务的。这里，作者出色地运用了讽刺艺术的表现手段，每一情节每一画面，都充满了对于敌人的尖锐的嘲笑和无情的抨击！
    影片不仅暴露了西德统治集团的罪恶活动，还真实地描绘出西德工人阶级和人民反对军国主义复活的波澜壮阔的斗争：工人群众在欢迎董事长的会上，高唱：“我们不会再上当，我们已经受尽了创伤……”；当战犯凯士麦被释放后，千万人民举行了愤怒的示威游行，使这位堂堂的元帅，不得不换上电梯工人的服装，像老鼠过街一样地偷偷溜掉。这些情节，说明了作者对于人民力量的无限信任，而这正是社会主义艺术的鲜明特点。
    艺术要有鲜明的政治内容，也要有突出生动的人物形象，只有这样它才能具有引人的魅力，收到更好的教育效果。这个影片的作者，在这点上也显示出他们的才华。假上尉阿尔培特的形象刻划得非常好！他的一言一行，一举一动，都吻合人物的身份。高等饭店招待的职业，使他洞悉资产阶级上层社会事俗和生活的一切；他糊里糊涂地被人利用，可是他毕竟不失为善良的人。他的性格特点和职业特点在这里，被表现得多么鲜明，其他一些人物，也都刻划得很好。
    民主德国的电影工作者以巨大的政治热情，把揭露西德复活军国主义和制止新战争的威胁作为自卫艺术活动中的重要任务，摄制出“科伦上尉”和别的一些具有现实意义的优秀影片。这些影片推动了人民反对军国主义复活的斗争。对于热爱和平的中国人民来说，这些影片也将会受到极大的重视和热烈的欢迎。
