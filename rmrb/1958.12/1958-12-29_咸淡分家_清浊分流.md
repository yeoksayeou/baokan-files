    Separate Salt and Fresh Water, Divert Clear and Polluted Flows
    Our reporters Zhao Yuxin, Yu Xigui
    Who can separate the salt and fresh water of the Hai River, divert the sewage and clear water, prevent flooding when there is too much water in autumn, and prevent drought when there is too little water in spring? Who dares to build a dam on the head of the "Dragon King" in the Bohai Bay, cutting off the turbulent, roaring Hai River estuary that rushes into the sea?
    The people of Tianjin, who have already mastered their own destiny, are now also becoming the masters of nature. After understanding the laws of the Hai River, they bravely conquer it, turning the Hai River, which has both advantages and disadvantages, into one with only advantages, making the stubborn and unruly river water obediently serve socialist construction.
    The place where the Eight-Nation Alliance landed with arms more than half a century ago has now become a battlefield for tens of thousands of troops to transform nature by moving mountains and overturning seas. A sea barrier like a giant arm extends towards the tail of the Hai River, head-on intercepting the waves. A dam resembling the Yangtze River Bridge closes off the river water pouring from the five rivers. Tens of thousands of laborers are changing the face of the Hai River day and night with the momentum of stopping the flow with a whip. Shen Pingzhang, a suburban farmer participating in the Hai River dam construction project, wrote these heroic verses: "In the past, the Foolish Old Man could move mountains, we must be ten times stronger than the Foolish Old Man, separating salt and fresh water for good irrigation, diverting clear and polluted water for freshness, smooth navigation brings great benefits, we will surely make the Dragon King obey orders."
    Making the Hai River obey people's "orders" is not an easy task. According to historical records, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Hai River basin averaged two droughts every three years and one flood every five years. In 1939, boats could travel on the streets of Tianjin, and in some places, floodwaters flooded the floors of the second story. The Hai River, the general汇集 of inland rivers in North China, is composed of many tributaries that run vertically and horizontally through Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia, such as the Chaobai River, Yongding River, Daqing River, Ziya River, South Canal, and North Canal. These tributaries, originating from the Taihang Mountains and Yanshan Mountains, form a centripetal water system on the North China Plain, converging in Tianjin to form the Hai River, which flows eastward to Dagukou and into the sea. The Hai River basin covers an area of 250,000 square kilometers, with a population of over 62 million. For thousands of years, it has nurtured the land and people on both sides. However, the meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the Hai River basin are that more than 60% of the annual rainfall is concentrated in July and August. Every time there is heavy rain in autumn, mountain torrents erupt, and hundreds of rivers pour into the Hai River, which must pass through the throat of the Hai River to enter the sea. If the discharge is not timely, it will cause floods. When there is a lack of rain in the spring, the water stored in the Hai River is almost completely discharged, resulting in drought. At this time, the seawater of Bohai Bay flows upstream with the tide, mixing with the sewage discharged from the sewers in Tianjin, making the Hai River water salty and fresh, and clear and turbid, affecting the irrigation of farmland on both sides and also affecting the water source for industry and civilian use in Tianjin. After liberation, the government gradually strengthened the restraint on this willful river. In its upper reaches, a new Duliujian River was dug directly into the sea, and the Xinkai River was rebuilt, turning the original one throat into the sea into three throats. Reservoirs such as the Guanting Reservoir, the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Huairou Reservoir, and numerous medium and small reservoirs were also built in the upper reaches of the river. This greatly reduced the threat of floods. However, due to the development of industrial and agricultural production, the demand for freshwater and the discharge of sewage have greatly increased. In the dry season, the shortcomings of the Hai River, such as salty, smelly, and scarce water, have become increasingly prominent. On April 20th of this year, the inflow of the Hai River had dropped to 4.2 cubic meters per second, which was equal to the amount of sewage discharged into the Hai River from the sewers. Some factories experienced a decline in product quality or were even unable to start operations due to the poor water quality. Some rice seedlings were pickled to death, and the drinking water for citizens was also very tight.
    The plan to thoroughly transform the Hai River was formulated based on the shortcomings of the Hai River and its laws. In addition to continuing to build more reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Hai River, the transformation project of the Hai River itself is divided into two major parts: "Separate Salt and Fresh Water" and "Divert Clear and Polluted Flows." These two major projects require sewage not to enter the river, saltwater not to flow upstream, and freshwater not to be lost; to achieve the goal of clear river water all year round, sufficient water sources, promoting irrigation, and benefiting shipping. Regarding the "Separate Salt and Fresh Water" project, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee had formulated nine plans, and finally selected the best, most economical, and scientifically reliable plan. The recently completed river-blocking dam, control gate, fishing boat gate, and other projects are the specific realization of this plan. The "Divert Clear and Polluted Flows" project is to change the direction of all the sewers in Tianjin that discharge sewage into the Hai River, so that the sewage is divided into five routes and seven systems, and discharged separately to the sewage treatment plants in the suburbs of Tianjin. This project involves building more than 200 kilometers of new sewers, which is almost twice as long as the distance from Tianjin to Beijing, and close to the total length of sewers built in Tianjin in the eighty or ninety years before liberation. Among them, there are 30 kilometers of horseshoe-shaped main pipes, in which jeeps can be driven. The scale of the project and the arduousness of the task are unprecedented in the history of Tianjin's municipal construction. The amount of earthwork for the river-blocking dam, control gate, and other projects alone is equal to ten times the amount of earthwork for the Ming Tombs Reservoir dam project. The "firewood stone pillows" thrown into the estuary when building the river-blocking dam are huge objects wrapped in reeds, stones, and iron wires, each 17 meters long and weighing 13 tons. Because it is the foundation of the seawall, people call it the "dragon-binding rope." A total of 68,700 such "dragon-binding ropes" were used.
    Now, the "Separate Salt and Fresh Water" project has been successfully completed, and the "Divert Clear and Polluted Flows" project will also be completed on the 30th of this month. Standing on the three-hundred-meter-long river-blocking dam, where the sea breeze is blowing, you can see the tide from Bohai Bay rushing head-on, only to surge under your feet, while the river water within the dam is calm and tranquil. From now on, this ancient river has become a natural reservoir that can store water, discharge floods, allow navigation, provide drinking water, and for sightseeing. In the future, its water level will be regularly controlled at 2.5 meters above the Dagukou sea level, which can avoid 1.55 billion cubic meters of freshwater flowing into the Bohai Sea in vain every year. With this water, the maximum demand for industrial and civilian water in Tianjin can be guaranteed.
    Seeing this heart-stirring scene, who can not think of the more than one hundred and eighty unforgettable days and nights in the past? Who can not think of those who created miracles? After the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee issued the call to transform the Hai River, thousands of people from factories, rural areas, schools, government agencies, and families poured into the Hai River dam construction site and the Hai River sewage reconstruction site. People had only one common desire, that is, to contribute their share of strength in taming the Hai River. From the day the project started, whether in the scorching summer with sweat streaming down their backs, or in the freezing winter with the sea wind, or in the season of continuous rain, everyone has been working energetically. People not only worked hard, but also worked practically and cleverly, setting off a technical innovation upsurge of "everyone contributing ideas and everyone contributing suggestions." People at the dam construction site put forward a total of more than 430,000 technical innovation suggestions, of which 268,000 were adopted and implemented. Officers and soldiers of a certain PLA unit stationed in Tianjin, after returning from working on the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, immediately投入 into the Hai River transformation project. They were the brave and resourceful main force in the river-blocking dam construction project. They didn't know what a "firewood stone pillow" was at first, but later they created a national record of binding and throwing one "firewood stone pillow" every four and a half minutes. When throwing "firewood stone pillows," they stood on the edge of the boat or on the head of the dam. Some people fell into the waves of the Hai River, climbed up and immediately threw themselves back into the battle. They worked in the biting cold wind, but when they got off work, they took off their life jackets and their cotton clothes were soaked with sweat.
    The leapfrog progress of the project is inseparable from the support of the people from all over the country. From Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan Island in the south, eleven provinces have directly supported the Hai River construction site with manpower and materials. After the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Department received the letter from the Tianjin Hai River Reconstruction Committee requesting support, it immediately transferred an experienced engineer and fourteen veteran dam builders to Tianjin to support the Hai River transformation project. On the 28th, the control gate lifted the gate to release water, and the dam construction headquarters announced the successful completion of the project. Tens of thousands of laborers on the construction site cheered and sang and danced. A group of young migrant workers waved their shoulder pads and sang loudly: "Millions of troops are in high spirits, pushing stones and transporting earth to build dam walls, benefiting the people and drinking sweet water, the rice flowers are fragrant on both sides of the Hai River."

    咸淡分家  清浊分流
    本报记者  赵玉昕  虞锡珪
    谁能使海河的咸水和淡水分家、污水和清水分流，在秋天水多的时候不淹，春天水少的时候不旱？谁敢在渤海湾“龙王”头上建闸，把奔腾咆哮、一泻入海的海河河口拦腰切断？
    已经掌握了自己命运的天津人民，现在又成为自然界的主人，在认识了海河的规律以后，勇敢地去征服它，把有利也有弊的海河，变得有利无弊，使顽冥不驯的河水服服贴贴地为社会主义建设服务。
    半个多世纪以前八国联军侵略中国时武装登陆的地方，现在变成了千军万马、移山倒海改造大自然的战场。一条像巨臂一样的拦海坝，伸向海河的尾闾，迎头截住了海浪。一座貌似长江大桥的大闸，关住了五河下注的河水。数万名劳动大军，以投鞭断流的气势，夜以继日地改变着海河的面貌。参加海河建闸工程的郊区农民申平章写下了这样豪壮的诗句：“以前愚公能移山，我们要比愚公强十番，咸淡分家好灌溉，清浊分流水新鲜，航运通畅利益大，定叫龙王听使唤。”
    要海河听从人们的“使唤”，并不是件轻而易举的事情。据历史记载：在明、清两代，海河流域平均三年两旱，五年一涝。1939年天津市的马路上可以行船，有的地方洪水漫上了二层楼的地板。海河，这条华北内河的总汇，是由纵横河北、山西、山东、内蒙古的潮白河、永定河、大清河、子牙河、南运河、北运河等许多支流组成。这些发源于太行山、燕山山脉的支流，到华北平原形成了一个向心形的水系，汇聚天津，形成海河，东流至大沽口入海。海河流域的面积达二十五万平方公里，约有人口六千二百多万。千百年来，它哺育着两岸的土地和人民。但是，海河流域气象、水文的特点是全年的降雨量60％以上集中在7、8两月。每遇到大雨滂沱的秋季，山洪暴发，百川灌河，都要通过海河这个咽喉入海，宣泄不及，就造成水灾。而到春季雨水缺乏的时候，海河存水几乎泻尽，干旱成灾；这时渤海湾的海水，乘着潮汐逆流而上，和天津市内下水道排泄的污水相混合以后，使海河河水变得咸淡不分、清浊混流，影响了两岸农田的灌溉，也影响了天津市工业和民用的水源。解放以后，政府逐年加强着对这条任性河流的约束。在它的上游，曾新挖了一条直接入海的独流碱河，重修了新开河，使原来入海的一个咽喉，变成了三个咽喉。还在它的上游河道修建了官厅水库、十三陵水库、怀柔水库和星罗棋布的中小型水库。这样洪水为患的威胁就大为减轻。但是，由于工农业生产的发展，淡水的需要量和污水的排泄量都大大增加。在枯水季节，海河的水又咸又臭又少的缺点，也就越来越突出了。今年4月20日，海河的来水量曾下降到四点二秒公方，已和下水道排入海河的污水量相等。有的工厂因水质恶劣，产品质量下降，甚至不能开工；有的稻田秧苗被腌死；市民饮水也十分紧张。
    彻底改造海河的规划，是根据海河的缺点和它的规律拟定的。除了继续在海河的上游修建更多的水库以外，海河本身的改造工程，共分为“咸淡分家”、“清浊分流”两大部分。这两大工程要求污水不入河，咸水不上溯，淡水不流失；实现一年四季河水清、水源足，兴灌溉、利舟楫的目的。关于“咸淡分家”的工程，天津市人民委员会曾制订过九个方案，最后选定了一个最好、最省而又科学可靠的方案，最近陆续建成的拦河坝、节制闸、渔船闸等工程，就是这个方案的具体实现。“清浊分流”的工程，是把全天津市向海河排泄污水的下水道全部改变流向，使污水分成五路、七个系统，分别排向天津郊区的污水处理场。这个工程共新建下水道二百多公里，比天津到北京的路程还长出将近一倍，接近于解放前八、九十年天津兴建下水道的总长度。其中有三十公里马蹄形的干管，里面可以跑开吉普车。工程规模之大，任务之艰巨，是天津市市政建设史上空前的。仅拦河坝、节制闸等工程的土方量，等于十三陵水库拦河坝土方工程的十倍。修拦河坝时抛向海口的“柴石枕”，是用芦苇、石块、铁丝裹起来的庞然大物，一个就有十七公尺长，十三吨重。因为它是防潮大坝的基础，因此人们叫它“捆龙索”。这样的“捆龙索”，共用了六万八千七百多个。
    现在，“咸淡分家”的工程已经胜利完工，“清浊分流”的工程也将在本月30日结束。站在海风飒飒的三百多公尺长的拦河坝上，可以看见从渤海湾迎面扑来的海潮，只能在脚下激荡，坝内盈盈的河水却是风平浪静。从此，这条古老的河流，变成了一个能蓄水、泄洪、通航、饮用和游览的天然水库，以后它的水位将经常控制在大沽海平零上二点五公尺的高度，每年可以避免十五点五亿公方的淡水白白地流入渤海。用这些水，就可以保证天津市工业和民用水的最高需要量。
    看到这个动人心魄的景象，谁能不联想到过去一百八十多个难忘的日日夜夜呢？谁能不联想到那些创造奇迹的人们呢？当中共天津市委和市人民委员会发出改造海河的号召以后，成千上万的人群从工厂、农村、学校、机关和家庭涌向到海河建闸工地和海河污水改建工地。人们只有一个共同的愿望，就是要在驯服海河中贡献自己的一分力量。从工程开工的那天起，无论是在汗流浃背的酷夏，还是在海风凛冽的寒冬，或者是在雨水连绵的季节，大家一直是精力充沛地劳动着。人们不仅苦干，而且实干、巧干，掀起了“人人献计，个个献策”的技术革新高潮。建闸工地上的人一共提出了技术革新建议四十三万多件，被采纳实现了二十六万八千件。解放军驻津某部官兵，从十三陵水库工地劳动回来，紧接着就投入了海河改造工程。他们是筑拦河坝工程中智勇双全的主力军。他们原来不知道什么叫“柴石枕”，后来却创造了每四分半钟捆抛一个“柴石枕”的全国纪录。在抛“柴石枕”的时候，他们站在船边上或坝头上，有人掉进海河浪涛里，爬上来又立即投入战斗。他们在刺骨的寒风中劳动，可是等到下班的时候，脱下救生衣来，棉衣都被汗湿透了。
    工程速度的飞跃进展是和全国各地人民的支援分不开的。北自黑龙江，南到海南岛，有十一个省直接用人力物力支援过海河工地。江苏省水利厅接到天津海河改建委员会要求支援的信后，立即抽调一个经验丰富的工程师和十四个筑坝老工人来天津支援改造海河的工程。28日，节制闸提闸放水，建闸指挥部宣布工程胜利完工了。工地上数万名劳动大军欢声雷动，载歌载舞。一伙青年民工挥动着肩垫，高声齐唱：“百万雄师气昂扬，推石运土垒坝墙，造福人民喝甜水，海河两岸稻花香。”
