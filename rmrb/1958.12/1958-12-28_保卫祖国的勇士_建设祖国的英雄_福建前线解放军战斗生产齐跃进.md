Valiant Warriors Defending the Motherland, Heroic Builders of the Motherland
The People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front Advances in Combat and Production Together

(Reported by this newspaper) The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, guarding the Fujian Front, is intensifying military training, crushing the war provocations and military threats of U.S. imperialism, and severely punishing the harassment of the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Taiwan and Kinmen. At the same time, they are joining the 14.5 million people of Fujian Province in the hot and heavy industrial and agricultural production and construction. They have played a significant role in the unprecedented victory of Fujian's industry, agriculture, and other construction this year, embodying the Chinese People's Liberation Army as both the defender of the motherland and the builder of socialism.

Fujian Province is located at the forefront of the southeastern coastal defense of the motherland. Since August this year, U.S. imperialism has intensified its war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, and the Chiang gang entrenched in Taiwan and Kinmen has also stepped up its harassment and sabotage. The brave officers and soldiers of the Fujian Front are severely punishing the harassment activities of the Chiang troops and defending the socialist construction of the motherland. At the same time, they are drawing a large amount of manpower and material resources to support the people of Fujian in realizing the great leap forward plan in production. From July to October this year, our land, sea, and air forces on the Fujian Front achieved great results in combat against the enemy, severely punishing the enemy.

As the news of victory frequently spread from the front, industrial and agricultural production and the mass steelmaking campaign in various parts of Fujian reached a climax. The PLA units on the front, like the broad masses of people, fully supported the front. During combat intervals, they went to the steel construction bases and mines and other production and construction fronts in battalion and regimental formations. In November, motor vehicle soldiers of the front's logistics units drove thousands of trucks over mountains and ridges to rush to transport iron sand, ore, and pig iron to support the battle of mass steelmaking in various places. The PLA soldiers strictly guarding the front lines used bomb casings dropped by the enemy to make steelmaking furnaces, and used broken shrapnel fired by the enemy as raw materials, making steel while fighting. In the largest newly built steel base in Fujian (Sanming), in the mining areas in central Fujian for coal and iron mining, and beside many iron-smelting furnaces... wherever production and construction was the most intense, there were PLA soldiers fighting hard. From November to early December, in forty days, the units on the front helped various places to produce more than 7,000 tons of steel, mined more than 10,000 tons of ore and iron sand, and mined 67,000 tons of coal. The motor vehicle soldiers of various units dispatched more than 97,000 vehicle trips, traveling more than 210,000 kilometers, and rushing to transport 158,000 tons of iron, coal, and ore. They supported the Fujian steelmaking army in completing this year's steel production task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

The units on the front also participated in the province-wide farmers' vigorous movement for a bumper agricultural harvest. From January to November this year, they dispatched a total of more than 3 million workdays, more than three times the total number of voluntary labor days in the previous year, to support farmers in rushing to cultivate, rush to plant, accumulate fertilizer, repair water conservancy, afforestation, processing and other production and construction tasks. They built 748 water conservancy and other projects, excavated more than 2.2 million cubic meters of earth and stone, accumulated and transported more than 100 million dan of fertilizer, and rushed to harvest crops on more than 210,000 mu. The officers and soldiers guarding the outpost islands, together with the masses on the island, held guns in one hand and hoes in the other, guarding the coastal defense while carrying out production and construction.

In the overall great leap forward, from the outpost islands to the vast mountainous areas, it is difficult to distinguish whether this is the front or the rear, whether it is supporting the front or supporting the rear. The heroic deeds of the PLA officers and soldiers who both defend the motherland and build the motherland have deeply educated the broad masses of the people of Fujian. The masses in various places use poems such as "Shovels and picks are used as knives and guns, valleys are used as battlefields, killing the enemy is heroic, and construction is capable" to praise their own soldiers.

    保卫祖国的勇士  建设祖国的英雄
    福建前线解放军战斗生产齐跃进
    本报讯  守卫在福建前线英勇的中国人民解放军，在加紧练武、粉碎美帝国主义的战争挑衅和军事威胁、严惩盘踞台湾、金门蒋军的骚扰的紧张斗争同时，和福建省一千四百五十万人民一起，投入了热火朝天的工农业生产建设，对今年福建工业、农业和其他各种建设的空前胜利，发挥了重大作用，体现了中国人民解放军既是祖国的保卫者，又是社会主义建设者。
    福建省处在祖国东南海防最前线，今年8月以来，美帝国主义在台湾海峡加紧进行战争挑衅，盘踞台湾、金门的蒋帮也加紧骚扰破坏。英勇的福建前线广大官兵，一面狠狠地惩罚蒋军的骚扰活动，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。一面抽调大批人力、物力支援福建人民实现生产大跃进计划。从今年7月到10月间，福建前线我陆海空军在对敌战斗中，获得很大的战果，狠狠地惩罚了敌人。
    在前线胜利消息频传之际，福建各地工农业生产和全民大炼钢铁等进入高潮，前线解放军各部队也像广大群众全力支援前线一样，在战斗空隙中成营成团地开赴钢铁建设基地和矿山等生产建设前线。11月间，前线各后勤部队的汽车兵们，驾驶着一千几百辆卡车翻山越岭抢运铁砂、矿石和生铁，支援各地大炼钢铁的战斗。严守在前线阵地上的解放军战士，用敌人丢下来的炸弹壳制成炼钢炉，用敌人打来的碎弹片作原料，一边战斗、一边炼钢。在福建新建的最大钢铁基地（三明）、在福建中部开煤、挖铁的矿区、在许多炼铁炉旁……，凡是哪里生产建设最紧张，哪里就有解放军的战士在奋战。从11月到12月上旬的四十天里，前线各部队就帮助各地炼钢铁七千多吨，开采矿石、铁沙一万多吨、挖煤六万七千吨。各部队汽车兵们共出动九万七千多车次，奔跑二十一万多公里，抢运铁、煤、矿石等十五万八千多吨。支援了福建钢铁大军提前超额完成了今年钢铁生产任务。
    前线各部队也投入了全省农民展开的轰轰烈烈的农业大丰收运动。从今年1月到11月共出动了三百多万个工，超过去年全年义务劳动日三倍多，支援农民抢耕、抢种、积肥、修水利、造林、加工等各项生产建设，修建了水利等工程七百四十八处，开挖土石方二百二十多万立方，积运肥料一亿多担，抢收庄稼二十一万多亩。守卫在前哨岛上的官兵们，同岛上群众一起，一手拿枪、一手拿锄，边保卫海防，边进行生产建设。
    在全面大跃进中，从各前哨岛屿到广大山区，很难分清这里是前线还是后方，是支援前线还是支援后方，解放军官兵既保卫祖国，又建设祖国的英雄事迹，深深教育了福建广大人民，各地群众都用“锹
  镐当刀枪、山谷当战场，杀敌是英  雄，建设是能将”等诗歌颂扬自己的子弟兵。（附图片）
