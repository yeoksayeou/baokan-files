    Passing on Production Experience and Explaining Theoretical Knowledge
    Collaboration Between Veteran Workers and Technicians in Lecturing Offers Many Benefits
    (Our Dispatch) The Shanghai Smelting Plant's spare-time Metallurgical College, through the collaboration of veteran workers and workshop technicians in lecturing in various ways, has enriched the teaching content and closely integrated technical theory with production practice. This combination of indigenous and foreign methods of teaching, which workers call "singing a duet," has been unanimously praised.
    Generally, for each technical lesson in this college, the workshop technical teaching and research group determines the content of the lecture. The workshop technical teaching and research group, composed of the workshop director, veteran workers, and technical personnel, determines the scope of the lecture content, prepares the outline of the lecture notes, and decides on the lecturers based on current production tasks and the needs of the students. After the veteran workers prepare the lesson, they conduct a trial lecture in the group, with technical personnel providing supplements. During the lecture, the technical personnel first briefly explain the key points and requirements of the lesson, or explain some principles and formulas from a theoretical perspective, followed by the veteran workers' explanation.
    Shen Qinchang, the furnace foreman of the Second Workshop, who has been working beside the reverberatory furnace for thirteen years, has rich experience in copper smelting. He and technician Yang Yunlong have given several technical lessons on rapid copper smelting and black copper smelting operation methods to the new workers' class. Shen Qinchang not only explained the operation process and key technical issues in detail each time, but also explained many "whys." For example, he started from the order of adding copper to the furnace door and talked about the furnace temperature problem, and further used the principle of thermal expansion and contraction to explain the relationship between temperature and furnace age. He explained everything clearly and logically, and the workers were very satisfied, saying that what these veteran workers said was much easier to understand than what the technical personnel said in the past, and could be immediately applied to production.
    Some technical lessons are first given by veteran workers explaining practical production experience, and then the technical personnel summarize and elevate it to a theoretical level for elaboration. Sometimes, after the "duet" is sung, the workers ask questions, identify difficult problems, and then let the students debate with each other, and then comprehensively summarize and clarify the principles. This also breaks the old method of "I lecture, you listen." When veteran worker Yang A'gen of the Third Workshop explained the lesson "Improving Current Efficiency," he combined his own operating experience and vividly and specifically explained the two main reasons affecting current efficiency: leakage and short circuits. After listening, the students raised some questions, and Yang A'gen and several veteran workers present answered them together. During the Q&A, the veteran workers not only talked about many operating methods and even practical experience on how to check equipment, but also talked about the reasons for the copper rods becoming cold, which everyone had not paid much attention to during operation. Finally, the technicians provided a comprehensive answer from a theoretical perspective and further explained the relationship between the coldness of the copper rods and the impact on current efficiency. Everyone agreed that this lesson was really good, with both theory and practice, and solved problems.
    When this college started in September this year, the technical course teachers who were originally hired were all technical personnel. The teaching content focused on technical theory and emphasized systematic improvement, with little connection to current production practice. Therefore, many workers were not interested in listening, and some simply did not go to class. The factory conducted a special study on this and determined that the technical course should focus on the key issues in current production as the teaching content. At the same time, following the principle of "the capable are teachers," veteran workers and advanced producers were mobilized to serve as teachers, or to co-teach with technical personnel. However, some people thought that workers could only do work and could not lecture, and doubted whether veteran workers could really be teachers. Now, in the past two months, twenty-one veteran workers in the factory have opened courses, and the workers in each workshop are very welcome to listen to their lectures. For several lessons, the classrooms were packed, and even the windowsills were full of people. Many technical personnel are also convinced and say that the workers teach well.

    既传授生产经验  又讲解理论知识
    老工人技术员合作讲课好处多
    本报讯  上海冶炼厂举办的业余冶金学院，由老工人和车间技术员以多种多样方式合作讲课，丰富了教学内容，使技术理论与生产实际紧密结合。这种土洋结合的教学方法，工人称之为“唱双簧”，得到一致好评。
    这个学院每次上技术课，一般都由车间技术课教研小组确定讲课的内容。车间技术课教研小组是由车间主任、老工人和技术人员组成的，他们根据当前生产任务和学员的需要，规定讲课内容范围，编写讲义提纲，并且决定讲课人选。老工人备课后，即在小组里试讲，由技术人员作补充。上课时，技术人员先简单说明这一课的重点和要求，或从理论上讲一些原理、公式，接着由老工人讲解。
    在反射炉旁工作十三年的第二车间值班炉长沈勤昌，对炼铜有丰富的经验。他同技术员杨云龙一起在新工人班，讲了快速炼铜和黑铜冶炼操作方法等好几次技术课。沈勤昌不仅每次详细地讲了操作过程、技术关键问题，而且说明了许多为什么。比如他从加铜的炉门先后谈到炉子温度问题，进一步用热胀冷缩的原理讲解了温度与炉龄的关系。他讲得头头是道，工人们听了都很满意，说这些老工人讲的，比过去技术人员讲的好懂得多，而且马上可用到生产中去。
    有些技术课，是先由老工人讲生产实际经验，后由技术人员归纳提高到理论上来加以阐述。有时在“双簧”唱过以后，由工人发问，找出疑难问题，让听课工人一起相互答辩，然后综合归纳阐明道理，这样也打破了“我讲你听”的老方法。第三车间老工人杨阿根在讲解“提高电流效率”这一课时，他结合自己的操作经验，又生动又具体地解释了影响电流效率的两个主要原因：漏电和短路。学生们听后提出一些疑问，杨阿根和在座听课的几个老工人一起作了解答。问答中，老工人不仅讲出许多操作方法以至如何检查设备的实际经验，而且讲了在操作中大家一直不大注意的铜杆发冷的原因。最后技术员从理论上作了综合解答，并且补充说明了铜杆发冷与影响电流效率的关系。大家一致认为这一堂课真好，既有理论又有实际，解决问题。
    今年9月，这个学院开学时，原来聘请的技术课教师都是技术人员，教学内容偏重技术理论，强调系统提高，与当前生产实际很少联系，因此许多工人听了没有兴趣，甚至有的干脆不去上课了。工厂为此作了专门研究，确定技术课以当前生产的关键问题为教学内容，同时按照“能者为师”的原则，发动老工人、先进生产者担任教师，或者与技术人员合作教课。但是有人认为工人只会做工不会讲课，怀疑老工人真能当教师。现在两个多月来，全厂已有二十一个老工人开了课，各车间的工人都非常欢迎听他们的课。好几堂课，课堂里挤满了人，连窗外都站满了人。许多技术人员也都信服地说工人上课上得好。
