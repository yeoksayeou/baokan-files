Small Red Flags Flutter Above Our Heads
Chongqing Steel Company, Liao Chongzhao

The open-hearth furnace overhaul project entered its fourth day of intense battle. Master Yang's eyes, usually full of smiles, were bloodshot. He hadn't left the furnace for half a step for four days and four nights since the beginning. When he was hungry, he asked someone to bring him a few steamed buns; he really hadn't had a good meal. We all knew that finishing the furnace one day earlier would mean producing 500 more tons of steel for the motherland. Steel is the lifeblood of socialism, and the more steel there is, the stronger the power of socialism.

This night was the most intense and fierce of the furnace construction battles. The open-hearth furnace bricklaying project entered the final process: "furnace roof bricklaying." We had fought hard for four or five days, and the final victory depended on this one night. Everyone was thinking about how to ensure quality and complete the task ahead of schedule. When assigning the task, Squad Leader Li resolutely stated that it must be completed within fourteen hours to allow for early baking of the furnace and create conditions for early steel production. After hearing this, everyone was silent, because this speed was about twice as fast as usual.

Master Yang was silent for two minutes, then looked at us, leaned over to Squad Leader Li's ear and whispered something. Squad Leader Li nodded in satisfaction, then said to everyone: "Comrades! The old method won't complete the task. Master Yang suggests dividing into three groups to work simultaneously. What do you all think?"

"Good!" Then Squad Leader Li divided the work: Master Yang laid the middle of the furnace roof, and my elder brother and I laid the two ends respectively. Finally, he added: "Today, it all depends on you three apprentices!" I couldn't help but feel nervous. From the day I started learning the craft, I had never left Master's side for half a step, like a baby inseparable from its mother; but now I had to operate independently, and at this critical juncture. Looking back at Master Yang, encouragement shone from his spirited eyes, as if saying: "Go for it! Be bold, work carefully, and you will successfully complete the task!" But time did not allow for hesitation, and we immediately climbed onto the furnace roof. I don't know if it was because I was too excited or what, but I was confused as soon as I started laying bricks and didn't know how to begin. I was anxious and blamed myself for not studying hard enough usually. I looked towards Master again and met his gaze. Master Yang seemed to see through my thoughts and strode towards me. While working, he said to me: "Little Liao, the first brick should be laid upside down, each layer should be close together, and each ring should be secure." I stopped breathing at that moment and took all these words to heart. Then, a thought flashed in my mind: I can't delay Master Yang for even a minute, and we are in a competition! So I said loudly to him: "Master, I remember, don't worry, you go back!" He watched me lay two more bricks, smiled, and returned to his original position.

The battle began.

All ninety rings of the furnace roof, more than three thousand eight hundred aluminum-magnesium bricks had to be neatly laid on the furnace roof. The average number of bricks to be laid per minute had long been engraved in my mind and mastered by our hands. Time passed second by second, and the bricks rose one by one. All that could be heard was the sound of the hammer striking the bricks and the "squeak" of the iron sheet being clamped. This was our labor song. Looking at the three rings of furnace roof bricks that had been laid, I thought, this is three times faster than before! I was sweetly happy in my heart. Just then, a loud voice suddenly came from the loudspeaker: "Comrades, the results of the furnace roof bricklaying competition show that the South end group has won, they have laid four rings. The North end group is last, I hope you catch up quickly..." I looked up at the small red "Labor Competition" flag fluttering in the wind next to my elder brother's head. It seemed to be waving and smiling at me. Looking again at my elder brother's short figure covered in mud, operating under the channel steel that was only half a meter high, moving as fast as a loach. I couldn't help but feel a burst of anxiety and shame. I lowered my head and hurried to lay bricks.

At this moment, a thick palm suddenly rested on my shoulder. Before I could look up, I heard: "Little Liao, don't panic, stay calm." I recognized Captain Liu's voice and immediately recalled what Little Zhao had told me about him during lunch yesterday: "Little Liao: Do you know that Captain Liu hasn't been home for five days and five nights since the furnace was shut down? His desk and stool are his bed." This morning at four o'clock, I saw him asleep on the desk. I was afraid of waking him up, so I locked the door. Who knew that he got up again before six o'clock. I heard Captain Liu say: "Little Liao, I see that the South end is laying bricks separately, why don't you try it too! How about I help you clip the paper?" Saying that, he joined our battle. The four of us cooperated closely, chasing each other, as if we were not laying bricks but racing against time, laying several bricks every minute. In the fourth evaluation, the red flag was planted above our heads, as majestic as the first time it was planted on my elder brother's head. We chased each other like this, fighting for seven hours, competing with time, and fighting against difficulties, finally creating a new national record for laying the roof of a medium-sized furnace.

We won. We all stood on the newly built furnace roof, like actors standing on a stage, singing a song we wrote ourselves to the audience: The furnace building workers have great enthusiasm, they are not afraid of any difficulties... The song spread in all directions, like a wave of jubilation.

    小红旗在我们头上飘
    重庆钢铁公司  廖崇钊
    平炉大修工程进入了第四天紧张战斗。杨师傅那一双常带微笑的眼睛充满了血丝，从开始起，他已经是四天四夜没有离开过炉子半步，饿了叫别人给他带几个馒头来，真是没有好好吃过一次饭。我们每个人都知道能早一天砌好炉子，就给祖国增产五百吨钢。钢是社会主义的生命，钢越多，社会主义的力量就越强。
    这一夜是砌炉战斗中最紧张最激烈的一夜，平炉砌砖工程进入了最后一道工序“炉顶砌砖”。我们苦战四五天，就看这一晚，能否争取到最后胜利。每个人脑子里都在想，要如何才能保证质量，提前完成任务。布置任务时李班长斩钉截铁地提出必须在十四个小时内完成，才能提前烘炉，为提前出钢创造条件。听了这段话，大家都沉默着，因为这样的速度比通常大约要加快一倍左右。
    只见杨师傅闷了两分钟，又望了望我们，回头在李班长的耳朵边咬了两下，李班长满意地点点头。然后向大家说道：“同志们！用老办法完不成任务了，杨师傅建议分成三个组同时进行。大家看看怎么样？”
      “好！”接着李班长就这样分了工：杨师傅砌中炉顶，师兄和我分别砌两头。最后他还补充一句：“今天就看你们三师徒罗？”不由得我不紧张。我从学手艺那天起，从未离开过师傅半步，好比婴儿不能离娘一样；可是现在要单独操作了，而且又在这节骨眼上。回头又望望杨师傅，从他那双有神的眼中射出鼓励的眼光，好像说：“干吧！大着胆子、细心地干，就会胜利完成任务！”可是时间不容许犹豫，我们立刻就跨上了炉顶。不知是我过于激动，还是什么原因，才开始砌砖就给迷惑住了，不知道该怎么开始？我心中焦急，又埋怨自己，为啥平时不好好学习呢？我又朝师傅那边望去，正和他的眼光碰上了。杨师傅好像看透了我的心思，大步向我走来。边做边对我讲道：“小廖，头块砖应倒砌，层层靠紧，环环靠牢。”我当时连呼吸都停止了，把这几句话全部吃到肚里去了。这时，我脑子里突然一闪，不能耽误杨师傅一分钟，而且还在竞赛呢！于是我大声对他说：“师傅，我记住了，你放心，你回去吧！”他再望着我砌了两块砖，微笑了一下，就回原处去了。
    战斗就这样开始了。
    全部炉顶九十环，三千八百多块铝镁砖要整整齐齐砌在炉顶上，每分钟平均砌几块砖早就刻在我的脑子里，也掌握在我们的手里了。时间一秒一秒的过去，砖也一块一块的上升着，只听着鎯头的击砖声和夹铁皮的“吱吱”声，这就是我们的劳动歌声。看着已做好的三环炉顶砖，心头想，这比以往要快三倍呢！心里甜蜜蜜地高兴。正在这当儿，突然从喇叭里传出了宏亮的声音：“同志们，炉顶砌砖竞赛评比现是南头组获胜，他们砌好了四环。北头组最后，希望你们快快赶上去……”我抬头望着插在师兄头顶边的那幅迎风飘扬着的“劳动竞赛”小红旗，它好像在对我招手，微笑。又望望师兄他那浑身泥浆的矮身材，在只有半公尺高的槽钢下操作，像一条泥鳅一般动得那么快。我不由一阵心急，心里非常惭愧，我低下头来赶忙着砌砖。
    这时，忽然一只厚厚的手掌放在我的肩上。还没有等我抬起头来，就听道：“小廖，不要慌，沉着应战。”我听出这是刘队长的声音，立刻我脑子里就浮现出昨天吃午饭时小赵对我谈的这段话来：“小廖：你知道刘队长从停炉以来已经五天五夜没回过家，他办公的桌子、凳子就是他的床铺。”今天早上四点钟的时候，我看见他伏在桌子上就睡着了。我怕别人惊醒他，把门反扣上。谁知不到六点钟他又爬起来了。只听得刘队长说：“小廖，我看南头那边是三人分开砌，你们也试试吧！我来给你们夹草纸好不好？”说着，他就加入到我们战斗中来了。我们四人密切配合，你追我赶，仿佛我们不是在砌砖，而是在和时间赛跑一样，一分钟都要砌它几块砖。这样在第四次评比时，红旗便在我们头顶插起了，也是和头次插在师兄头顶上一样威风。我们就这样你追我赶，战斗了七个小时，和时间竞争，与困难搏斗，终于创造了全国中型炉顶砌炉新纪录。
  我们胜利了。我们大家站在刚砌好的炉顶上，好像演员站在舞台上一样，向观众唱着我们自己编的一首歌曲：砌炉工人干劲大，任何困难都不怕……。歌声传向了四面八方，像一片欢腾的波浪。
