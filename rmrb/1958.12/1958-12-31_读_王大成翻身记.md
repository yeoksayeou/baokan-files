Reading "The Story of Wang Dacheng's Emancipation"
		Su Fang
	The novella "The Story of Wang Dacheng's Emancipation" (by Yu Shengbai) tells a story that took place in the Chinese countryside before liberation: Wang Dacheng, a young farmer, was persecuted by the local tyrant, village head Tiangou, and the rogue soldier Huangshulang. Together with another victim, he joined the Eighth Route Army. In the end, he not only avenged himself but also tempered himself into a true revolutionary fighter in the flames of battle.

	Through the various persecutions suffered by Wang Dacheng's family, the novel profoundly exposes the tragic situation in which local feudal forces and rogue soldiers colluded to exploit the people during the Anti-Japanese War, as well as the ugly faces of Tiangou, Huangshulang, and others who committed all kinds of evil. The author uses satirical and mocking strokes to write about the circumstances of Tiangou and Huangshulang's acquaintance. The combination of Tiangou and Huangshulang meant that the tyrannical forces had found a gun as their backing, and the rogue soldiers had taken root locally. Their power was greater, and they dared to act more recklessly. Because Tiangou had an old feud with Wang Dacheng's father, he falsely accused him of theft, saying that Wang Dacheng had stolen the pants of Tiangou's niece (who was also Huangshulang's lover), Fenman, and beat him severely; when Wang Dacheng's father went to Tiangou to reason with him, he was shot dead by him! In order to eliminate the roots of the problem, Wang Dacheng was also labeled as a "Communist element," arrested, and faced the danger of being killed. If Lin Chunxiao, the soldier guarding him, who was also a victim, had not released him and they had gone together to find the Communist Party, the shadow of that miserable fate would have followed him forever... All these dark facts—the sinister and ruthless nature of Tiangou and others, their cruel persecution of Wang Dacheng's family—are a powerful accusation against the old society that this book puts forward. By contrasting the dark situation in which local tyrants and rogues once dominated with today's spring-filled scene, and by comparing Wang Dacheng's tragic experience with the happy life of today's farmers, we can clearly recognize this truth: if farmers want to overthrow the mountains weighing on their heads and achieve complete liberation, the only path is to follow the Communist Party!

	In addition to exposing the crimes of the reactionary forces and portraying the ugly images of Tiangou and others, this book's depiction of the character of the older generation of farmers is also quite realistic. Wang Mingyi (Wang Dacheng's father), Dacheng's mother, and "Lao Niujin" (Old Bullock Tendon), the old farmer encountered by Shuhui (Dacheng's fiancée) after they fled, appear infrequently and occupy little space in the book, but they all leave a lasting impression. The author begins by briefly introducing Wang Mingyi's character, saying that he is "upright and fair in his dealings"; and in the section where he goes to Tiangou to reason, he more prominently demonstrates his straightforward and fearless character. After learning that his son had been severely beaten, he did not go to the powerful Tiangou to beg and plead but risked his life to argue and reason. Although the soldiers swung their rifle butts and beat him like rain, he did not yield. He dared to accuse Tiangou of "falsely accusing good people for no reason," dared to scold him for "abusing his power," and even dared to ride on Tiangou and "beat him relentlessly like Wu Song fighting the tiger." Although he later died, his indomitable spirit deeply moved the readers. In contrast to Wang Mingyi's character, Lao Niujin shows more of the narrow and selfish shortcomings of the farmers. The author very vividly describes the character of this stingy old farmer nicknamed Lao Niujin, saying that he "not only regards a grain of rice as a grain of gold, but he never urinates on other people's land." When his wife, out of sympathy for the plight of Dacheng's mother and Shuhui, prepared to let them live in their home, he felt very uneasy; but when he really learned of Shuhui's tragic situation and knew that they were both hardworking and kind people, he also sympathized with them and helped them. Whether it is Wang Mingyi, Lao Niujin, or Lao Niujin's wife, although they have different personalities, and some even have quite significant shortcomings; however, they all reveal the pure and kind qualities inherent in our country's farmers.

	It can be seen that "The Story of Wang Dacheng's Emancipation" is influenced by China's traditional chapter novels in terms of its expressive techniques and language use; however, the author is not constrained by this inherent form but rather uses this form quite freely, so it does not give people a feeling of being formulaic or deliberately imitating. The development of the novel's events is clear, with a beginning and an end, without being digressive; the transitions between chapters are concise and rigorous, yet there are no artificial traces of carving; the language is simple, easy to understand, and approachable, easy to read aloud, but without clichés, simple, natural, and fluent, allowing people to read to the end in one breath. Some chapters are written quite delicately and vividly, such as the chapter "Mandarin Ducks Playing in the Water," which describes Shuhui asking Wang Mingyi to mediate a dispute for her elder brother and sister-in-law, while Dacheng's mother takes the opportunity to instruct Shuhui to make a bellyband for Dacheng, embroidered with a pattern of mandarin ducks playing in the water. This chapter does not have much plot, but through the chat between Dacheng's mother and Shuhui, and through the scene of Shuhui and Dacheng working together, it fully reveals the harmonious atmosphere between this family and expresses their yearning for a happy life. The figures of these people—Dacheng's mother's kindness and gentleness, Shuhui's innocence and charm, and Dacheng's simplicity and straightforwardness—all leap onto the page, appearing lifelike. Another example is the chapter "Two Fiery Hearts," which describes the exchange of heartfelt words between Shuhui and Dacheng when Shuhui goes to take care of him after he is severely beaten, which also vividly expresses Shuhui and Dacheng's sincere love and vividly depicts the feelings of young lovers. There are also some chapters that write about the activities of the armed work team, which are full of legendary colors. In this regard, I believe that as long as it is not too exaggerated, and does not pursue the thrilling and bizarre plot too much, it can better express the heroic spirit of the anti-Japanese heroes and can also make the plot development more tortuous and attractive. The book writes about Wang Dacheng's solo venture into the tiger's den and his struggle against the rogue soldier Ma Liu, which has such characteristics.

	Although this book is written quite vividly and has a strong storyline, it does not leave a deep impression after reading it, giving people a feeling of dissatisfaction. Why is this? The main reason is probably that it still has obvious shortcomings. The portrayal of the negative characters in the book is quite detailed and profound, but for the main positive characters, although some places are written vividly, in general, their images cannot stand up. Taking Wang Dacheng, the central character, as an example, the author writes about his growth relatively simply. Wang Dacheng joined the revolution with the idea of revenge. When the superiors asked him and the armed work team leader to go to the vicinity of Laiyang to open up work, he could not understand it, because he could not go back to his hometown to avenge himself but instead went west. After that, although the book writes about the exploits of the armed work team and Wang Dacheng, there is not much real contact with the characters' ideological activities. And by the chapter "Playing Ma Liu to Borrow Horses to Break the Encirclement," Wang Dacheng is so resourceful and brave in front of the enemy, fully demonstrating that he is already a fairly veteran soldier. How did he jump out of the circle of personal revenge, how did he abandon his narrow peasant consciousness, and grow into a truly conscious and fearless revolutionary fighter? There is a lack of a more detailed process in between. The growth of others like Shuhui and Lin Chunxiao also has similar shortcomings.

	The living scenes reflected in this book are also relatively narrow, especially when writing about the activities of the armed work team, this shortcoming is even more prominent. Our army and the masses have an inseparable blood relationship, and our victory comes with the support and help of the masses; but the activities of the armed work team written in the book are often carried out alone, without any contact with the masses. In fact, the main task of the armed work team going to work near Laiyang was also to mobilize the masses and expand the revolutionary forces. Here, there was an opportunity to reflect the faces of the local masses and their relationship with the armed work team; unfortunately, the author lightly let this go. At the beginning, he only briefly explained that there were difficulties in mobilizing the masses, and then concentrated on writing about the activities of the armed work team to eliminate the big landlord Shen Wansan. When Shen Wansan was overthrown, and the mountain weighing on the masses had been overthrown, and the masses dared to speak, the author only briefly said that the masses had been mobilized and then ended. The hardship of truly mobilizing the masses, the vigorous appearance of the anti-Japanese activities vigorously carried out after the masses were mobilized, and the close connection between the armed work team and the masses were not given due expression. In addition, the resolution of some key contradictions is also sought through chance events, such as Wang Dacheng's release, Wang Dacheng's encounter with Ding Qiba on the road, etc., so it also lacks persuasiveness and credibility.

	"The Story of Wang Dacheng's Emancipation" comes from the hand of an amateur author. In order to make the work more perfect, the author has spent a lot of effort and made several major revisions. The author's serious attitude towards creation and his rigorous spirit deserve praise. And the fact that amateur authors dare to pick up their pens and write such a work with a certain degree of ideological and artistic merit is also very gratifying and worthy of encouragement.

    读“王大成翻身记”
    苏方
    中篇小说“王大成翻身记”（于胜白著）写的是解放前中国农村中发生的一个故事：青年农民王大成因为受到恶霸乡长天狗和兵痞流氓黄鼠狼的迫害，和另一个受苦人一起参加了八路军。最后，他不但报了仇，并且在战斗的烈火中锻炼成了真正的革命战士。
    小说通过王大成一家遭受的种种迫害，相当深刻地暴露了抗日战争时期地方上的封建势力和兵痞流氓相勾结、鱼肉百姓的惨状，以及无恶不作的天狗、黄鼠狼等人的丑态。作者以讽刺嘲弄的笔触，写出了天狗和黄鼠狼结识的情况。天狗和黄鼠狼的结合，意味着恶霸势力找到了枪杆子做后台，兵痞势力在地方上扎下了根，他们的权势更大，更敢胡作非为了。因为天狗和王大成的父亲旧有嫌隙，便硬诬良为盗，说王大成偷去了天狗的侄女（也是黄鼠狼的姘头）粉嫚的裤子，把他毒打了一顿；王大成的父亲去找天狗说理，反而被他用枪打死！为了斩草除根，王大成又被他们扣上“共党分子”的帽子，遭到逮捕，惹起了杀身之祸。要不是看守他的士兵、也是受苦人的林春晓释放了他，他们一起去找到了共产党，那可悲的命运的暗影，将永远追随在他的身后……这种种黑暗的事实——天狗等人的险恶狠毒，他们对于王大成一家的严酷的残害，是这本书对于旧社会所提出的有力的控诉。把当时那恶霸流氓一手遮天的黑暗状况和今天春色满园的情景相对照，把王大成的惨痛的遭遇和今天农民的幸福生活相印证，我们可以清楚地认识到这个真理：农民要想推翻压在头上的大山，获得彻底解放，唯一的道路便是跟着共产党走！
    除了揭露了反动势力的罪行，刻划出了天狗等人的丑恶形象之外，这本书对于老一辈农民的性格描写也是相当真切的。王大成的父亲王明义、大成母和淑慧（大成的未婚妻）流亡后碰到的老农民“老牛筋”等，出场不多，在书中所占的篇幅很少，但是他们却都给人留下了难忘的印象。作者一开始就简要地介绍了王明义的性格，说他“为人正直，办事公道”；而在他去找天狗说理那一节，更加突出地表现了他的耿直的不怕事的性格特点。他知道儿子被毒打以后，不是去向有权有势的天狗哀告乞怜，而是拼着老命去争论说理。虽然当兵的抡起枪把子，像下雨一样打在他身上，他也没有屈服。他敢于指斥天狗“平白诬陷好人”，敢于骂他“狗仗人势”，甚至还敢骑在天狗身上“像武松打虎一样，痛打个不休”。他后来虽然死了，但他那至死不屈的气势，却深深感动了读者。和王明义的性格相对照，在老牛筋身上则更多显示了农民狭隘自私的缺点。这个混名老牛筋的吝啬的老农民，作者非常形象地形容了他的性格，说他“别说把一粒米看作一粒黄金，就是自家的尿，也从来不尿在别人地上”。当他的老婆因为同情大成母亲和淑慧的遭遇，准备让她们住到自己家里来时，他很不自在；但是当他真的知道淑慧她们的惨景，知道了她们都是勤苦的好人以后，他也同情她们，帮助她们了。不管王明义也好，老牛筋也好，或者老牛筋的老婆也好，虽然他们有着各不相同的性格，有的甚至有着相当显著的缺点；然而他们身上，都流露出我国农民所具有的纯朴善良的气质。
    看得出来，“王大成翻身记”这本书在表现手法上和语言的运用上，都受到我国传统的章回小说的影响；但是，作者并没有为这种固有的形式所束缚，而是相当自如地运用这种形式的，因此并不给人落套或者有意摹拟的感觉。小说事件发展清清楚楚，有头有尾，不蔓不枝；章节的起承转合简洁严密，却又没有人为的雕琢痕迹；语言是通俗易懂、平易近人的，念得上口，但是并没有陈词滥调，朴素自然而又流利，使人能够一口气读到底。其中有些章节写得相当细腻生动，例如“鸳鸯戏水”这一章，写的是淑慧请王明义去为哥嫂调解纠纷，大成母顺便嘱咐淑慧为大成做一个肚兜，绣上鸳鸯戏水的花样等。这一章并没有多少情节，但是通过大成母和淑慧的闲谈，通过淑慧和大成一起劳动的情景，却充分显露出这一家人之间融洽和睦的气氛，表达出他们对于幸福生活的向往。这几个人的身影——大成母的温厚善良，淑慧的天真娇憨，大成的朴实耿直，都跃然纸上，显得活龙活现。又例如“两颗火热的心”这一章，写大成遭到毒打后，淑慧去照顾他时两人互诉心曲的事，也非常鲜明地表现了淑慧和大成的真挚的爱情，历历如绘地描画出了那种小儿女情态。也有一些写武工队的活动的章节，富于传奇色彩。在这方面，我以为只要不过于虚夸，不过多追求情节的惊险离奇，是能够更好地表现抗日英雄们意气风发的英姿，也能够使情节发展更为曲折引人的。书中写王大成独胆闯虎穴，向兵痞马流作斗争等事情，正有着这样的特点。
    虽然这本书写得相当生动，故事性也较强，但是读后给人印象却不太深，使人有不满足之感。为什么会这样呢？主要恐怕是由于它还存在着明显的缺点。书中对于反面人物的刻划，倒是相当细致深刻的，而对于主要的正面人物，虽然个别地方写得还生动，但是总的说来他们的形象却站不起来。就以王大成这个中心人物来说吧，作者对他的成长就写得比较简单。王大成是带着复仇思想参加革命的。当上级要他和武工队长等人到莱阳附近去开辟工作时，他很搞不通，因为不能打回老家去报仇，反而向西去了。其后，书里虽然写了武工队和王大成的战绩，但是真正接触到人物思想活动的却并不多。而到“戏马流借马出围”一章，王大成在敌人面前那样巧智多谋，那样英武有为，则充分表现出他已经是一个相当老练的战士了。他怎样跳出个人复仇的圈子，怎样抛弃了狭隘的农民意识，而成长为一个真正自觉的无畏的革命战士的呢？这其间是缺乏比较细致的过程的。他如淑慧、林春晓等人的成长，同样也有着这样的缺点。
    这本书所反映的生活场景，也比较狭窄，特别在写武工队的活动时，这个缺点就更加突出。我们的军队和群众有着不可分割的血肉关系，我们的胜利是在群众的支持帮助下得来的；但是书中写的武工队的活动，却常常是在单枪匹马、不和群众发生什么联系的状况下进行的。其实武工队去莱阳附近工作，主要也在于发动群众，扩大革命势力，在这里是有机会反映出当地群众的面貌和他们和武工队的关系的；可惜作者却把这轻轻放过了。开头只简单地交代了一下发动群众有困难，以后就集中精力去写武工队铲除大地主沈万三的活动去了，而当沈万三被打倒，压在群众头上的大山已被推翻，群众敢讲话了的时候，作者又只概略地说了一下群众已经发动起来便结束了，而真正发动群众工作如何艰苦，群众发动起来后抗日活动蓬勃开展的旺盛面貌，以及武工队和群众的紧密联系等，都没有得到应有的表现。此外，有些带有关键性的矛盾的解决，也是求助于偶然性的事件，如王大成的被释放，王大成路打丁七扒等等，因此也缺乏说服力和可信性。
    “王大成翻身记”出自一位业余作者之手，为了使作品能够完美一些，作者曾经花了很大力气，作了几次重大的修改。作者对待创作的严肃的态度和认真不苟的精神，是值得赞扬的。而业余作者勇于提起笔来，写出这样有一定思想性和艺术性的作品，也是令人万分欣慰的值得鼓励的事。
