Entering the Commune is Like Ascending to Heaven
——Selected New Yunnan Folk Songs

    The people's commune is truly good, adapting to local conditions and ensuring high quality. Rice and rapeseed are planted in the dams, while flue-cured tobacco and coarse grains cover the hills.
    The people's commune is truly good, caring for the old and the young alike. Children are sent to nurseries, and the elderly smile in homes of happiness.
    The people's commune is truly good, running schools of all sizes. Men and women, old and young, gain education, marching towards socialism.  (Yuxi)
    Entering the commune is like ascending to heaven, surpassing decades in a single night. Sharp knives sever the roots of private ownership, opening a new epoch in history.
    In the past, women guarded three platforms: the millstone, the well platform, and the cooking stove. Firewood, rice, oil, salt, ginger, scallions, and garlic kept them busy all day.
    Since canteens were set up, sisters and aunties beam with joy, liberating women's labor power, adding talent to the agricultural front. (Kunming)

    入了公社如上天
    ——云南新民歌选人民公社真正好，因地制宜质量高，稻谷油菜栽坝田，烤烟杂粮上山包。人民公社真正好，又养老来又养小，娃娃送进托儿所，幸福院中老人笑。人民公社真正好，大中小学都办了，男女老少有文化，朝着社会主义跑。  （玉溪）入了公社如上天，一夜赛过几十年，利刀斩断私有根，开辟历史新纪元。过去妇女守三台：磨台、井台和锅台，柴米油盐姜葱蒜，整天忙得头难抬。自从办起食堂来，嫂子大娘笑开怀，解放妇女劳动力，农业战线添人才。  （昆明）
