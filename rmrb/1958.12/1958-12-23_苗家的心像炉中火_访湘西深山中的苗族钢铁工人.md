    The Miao People's Hearts are Like Fire in a Furnace
    ——Visiting Miao Steelworkers in the Deep Mountains of Western Hunan
    By Our Correspondent Wang Zhuofei
    November in Western Hunan is the early winter season. In the continuous Miao Mountains, pines and bamboos flourish, a lush green, with only clusters of red maple trees dotting the landscape, a beautiful picture! In this wonderful season, at the foot of the hills of green pines and bamboos, the reporter visited the Xiaopaiwu Steel Base in Huayuan County, Western Hunan, known as the "Little Anshan." Here, there are over two hundred indigenous blast furnaces and more than 12,000 workers, the majority of whom are Miao steelworkers, the main force of the Xiaopaiwu Steel Base.
    Before going to this steel base, when visiting a people's commune in Huayuan County, many Miao commune members boasted to me about the "Little Anshan" in the Miao Mountains, proudly saying: We already have steelworkers, it's really very good, very good!
    It is easy to understand the Miao people's feelings. Living in the socialist family of the motherland, they are proud to be able to contribute their strength to the 10.7 million tons of steel together with people of all ethnic groups. A Miao folk song sings out this precious feeling of the Miao people:
    Laughing down the mountain, singing up the mountain, putting down the hoe, entering the iron factory.
    The Miao people's hearts are like fire in a furnace, for the sake of the 10.7 million tons of steel.
        To "Little Anshan"
    In late November, on a clear day, the reporter went to "Little Anshan."
    The Miao Mountains of Xiaopaiwu have abundant high-quality iron ore, some of which is exposed on the surface. You can see the ore by stepping on it a few times on the hillside. But the Miao people here have never smelted steel or had steelworkers. The Miao people have always regarded iron smelting as a very mysterious thing. They knew there was ore in the mountains, but they dared not smelt it, treating the ore as gods.
    The indigenous blast furnaces of "Little Anshan" are built on the hillsides, some with three rows of furnaces, some with four rows, one row higher than the other, a magnificent sight, like tall building complexes in the city. Next to the blast furnaces, many Miao male workers, stripped to the waist and wearing Miao headscarves, wielded iron rods, sweating profusely, working hard in front of the hot furnaces. There were also many Miao women with silver rings around their necks and wearing floral-trimmed clothes and trousers, in front of the bellows, in the ore-hammering workshops, singing and working.
    I arrived at the factory director's office. The young Factory Director Li enthusiastically introduced the situation to me, talked about the Miao people's superstition in ghosts and gods, and told me a meaningful but interesting story: On the mountains of Xiaopaiwu, there was a piece of ore taller than a person exposed on the ground, shaped like a tooth. The Miao people called this ore "God's Tooth," and no one dared to touch it. This year, the Party called on the whole people to vigorously produce steel. The Miao people broke through superstition and boldly pulled out the "God's Tooth" and sent it to the furnace to smelt iron. It was from this time that the Miao people in the deep mountains had steelworkers.
    Factory Director Li also said that once the superstition was broken, the Miao people's enthusiasm for steelmaking could really soar to the sky. He then introduced me to many model deeds of Miao steelworkers. Based on Factory Director Li's introduction, I visited some new Miao heroes who had displayed great skill on the steel front.
          New Miao Heroes
    The young Miao steelworker Shi Laoshi is a furnace operator of the "Youth League Furnace." On November 3, the molten iron and slag in Shi Laoshi's furnace solidified together, becoming a "cow's brain" (Miao workers call this solidified material a "cow's brain"), stuck in the furnace and unable to be removed.
    Coincidentally, November 5 was the "Satellite Day" of "Little Anshan," and he was very anxious that he might not be able to launch a "satellite" in time. When the furnace was still steaming hot and the bottom was scorching hot, he put on his soaked shirt and straw sandals and crawled into the furnace, vigorously knocking on the "cow's brain." He came out to rest every half hour, and when his clothes were baked dry, he soaked them again with water and crawled back in. In this way, he worked continuously for five hours before removing all the "cow's brain."
    In these five hours of selfless labor, he became dizzy from the heat and burned his feet. The leaders wanted him to rest, but he refused and actively participated in the preparations for welcoming "Satellite Day," until his furnace flowed out with glittering molten iron at one o'clock on the 5th, he then went to rest with peace of mind.
    The reporter met this simple Miao steelworker in front of the iron smelting furnace. He was sweating profusely, working hard in front of the furnace. Other Miao workers enthusiastically told the reporter: Our Shi Laoshi has been rated as a Grade A model worker, it's really an honor!
    Another moving story is circulating on the steel base: When Miao worker Shi Chengying's furnace was competing with a women's furnace, the women's furnace had a "cow's brain," the molten iron stopped flowing, and the bellows were not working, the women were so anxious that they didn't know what to do.
    At this time, Shi Chengying and his companions took the initiative to help the women's furnace remove the "cow's brain." Shi Chengying took off his shirt and worked close to the furnace opening. Sparks sprayed out of the furnace, burning many blisters on his face and body, but he didn't care. He treated other people's difficulties as his own, wholeheartedly helping others. After half a day's effort, the women's furnace returned to normal production. As a result of the competition, the daily output of the women's furnace reached 1,400 jin, higher than the output of Shi Chengying's furnace, and the red flag was flying on the women's furnace.
    Although Shi Chengying's furnace did not get the red flag, they were equally happy. They said that as long as they can produce more iron for the country, it's the same no matter whose furnace they work in front of. The Party Committee of the steel base believed that Shi Chengying's furnace was a furnace that put politics in command and called it an ideological red flag.
            Two Women Teng Shumei
    On the steel base, Miao women are not to be outdone. Whether in the furnace workers, in the bellows operators, or in the ore hammerers, there are Miao model women. They are as capable as men and do a very good job.
    In the ore-hammering team, there are two Miao women, both named Teng Shumei. One is twenty-nine years old and taller, so she is called Big Teng Shumei, and the other is nineteen years old and shorter, so she is called Little Teng Shumei. Both of them are skilled ore hammerers.
    One day, Little Teng Shumei hammered 1,500 jin of ore, while others only hammered 500 jin to 800 jin a day.
    Someone asked her: How can you hammer so much?
    She replied very frankly: If you hammer more ore, more molten iron will flow, how can you not hammer more?
    Little Teng lost her parents when she was twelve years old. At that time, she also had an eight-year-old sister and a six-year-old brother, who completely relied on government relief money and grain to live. After the collectivization, her family was a "five guarantees" household, with food and clothing, carefree. After the establishment of the people's commune, her sister worked in the kindergarten, her brother studied in elementary school, and she went to "Little Anshan" to hammer ore. She said to the reporter with excitement, if it weren't for the Communist Party, how could the Miao orphans have today.
    Big Teng Shumei's enthusiasm is even greater. She once hammered 1,800 jin of ore in one day. In the ore-hammering workshop, she often sang loudly: My hands are harder than iron, my heart is stronger than steel, I want to hammer all over Wanbao Mountain, I want to hammer up steel walls and iron walls, I want to hammer to liberate Taiwan, I want to hammer away the American imperialist wolves."
    Big Teng Shumei is outstanding in terms of unity and hard work. When new workers come to the ore-hammering workshop, she is enthusiastic to care for them. Sometimes, she goes to the ore-hammering workshop first to sweep the yard clean, so that the new workers can hammer ore comfortably. When some workers are sick, she actively goes to the clinic to get medicine, brings food to the patients, and patiently takes care of the patients. Her deeds are remarkable, and the workers rated her as a special-class model. Little Teng also gloriously joined the Communist Youth League on the steel front.
    When the reporter visited them, Little Teng Shumei happily talked to the reporter about the situation when she took the oath to join the League the day before. Big Teng Shumei then said, I am older and cannot join the League, but I am determined to strive to join the Communist Party. She also said to Little Teng with a smile: In the past, the commune was home, now the factory is home.
                × × ×
    On the day of leaving Xiaopaiwu, when the reporter was visiting Miao workers, he saw a poem praising Xiaopaiwu on the construction site, two paragraphs of which read:
        The day before yesterday I passed Paiwu, thorns and weeds covered the mountainside,
        Smoke from cooking stoves faintly visible, few pedestrians, much solitude before and after the mountains.
        Today I passed Paiwu, mining heroes fill the mountainside,
        Molten iron flows like rising water, workers sing loudly songs of overtaking England.
    As the poem says, in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in Steel, a large number of heroic model figures have indeed emerged in Xiaopaiwu in the Miao Mountains. In November, the workers conducted evaluations and selected more than 500 model figures. In November, the Communist Youth League Committee of the steel base admitted more than 80 outstanding young steelworkers into the League. The vast majority of these model figures and outstanding youths are Miao steelworkers. From this, it can also be seen that Miao steelworkers have rapidly grown up in the family of the motherland, and they will contribute even greater strength in the common task of all ethnic groups fighting for steel.

    苗家的心像炉中火
    ——访湘西深山中的苗族钢铁工人
    本报记者  王濯非
    湘西的11月，是初冬季节。在连绵不绝的苗岭中，松竹并茂，一片翠绿，惟有一丛丛的红色枫树，点缀其间，好一幅美丽的图画！就在这美好的季节，在青松翠竹的山岗下，记者访问了一个被称为“小鞍钢”的湘西花垣县小排吾钢铁基地。这里有二百多个土高炉，一万两千多工人，其中苗族钢铁工人占绝大多数，他们是小排吾钢铁基地的主力军。
    我没有到这个钢铁基地去以前，在花垣县一个人民公社访问的时候，就有很多苗族社员向我夸耀苗岭中的“小鞍钢”，并自豪地说：我们已有了钢铁工人，真是好得很、好得很！
    苗家的这种心情是容易理解的。他们生活在祖国的社会主义大家庭中，能够和各族人民一道，为一千零七十万吨钢贡献出自己的力量而感到骄傲。有一首苗歌唱出了苗家的这种可贵的心情：
    山下笑来山上唱，放下锄头进铁厂。
    苗家的心像炉中火，为的一千零七十万吨钢。
        到“小鞍钢”去
    11月下旬，一个天气晴朗的日子，记者到“小鞍钢”去了。
    小排吾的苗岭中有丰富的质量很好的铁矿，有些矿石已露出地面，在山坡上用脚踏几下就可以看到矿石。可是这里的苗家从来没有炼过钢铁，也没有过钢铁工人。苗家一直把炼铁当作一件非常神秘的事情。他们知道山中有矿，但不敢炼，把矿石当作神仙。
    “小鞍钢”的土高炉是建在山坡上的，有的山坡上有三排高炉，有的有四排高炉，一排高过一排，那种雄伟的气魄，真像城市中高大的建筑群。在高炉旁，有许多打着赤膊头上还围着苗家头帕的苗族男工，舞动铁棍，汗流浃背，在灼热的炉前紧张劳动。还有很多颈上围着银圈、身穿花边衣裤的苗家妇女在鼓风箱前，在捶矿车间，一面歌唱，一面劳动。
    我到了厂长办公室。年轻的李厂长热情地向我介绍情况，谈到了苗家迷信鬼神的事情，并告诉我一件有意义的但又有趣的事情：在小排吾的山上，有一块露出地面的一人多高的矿石，形如牙齿，苗家把这块矿石称为“神牙”，谁也不敢动它。今年，党号召全民大搞钢铁，苗家破除了迷信，才大胆地把“神牙”拔出来，送到炉中炼铁，也就是从这个时候开始，深山中的苗家才有了钢铁工人。
  李厂长还说，一经破除了迷信以后，苗家人炼钢铁的干劲真可以冲天。他接着向我介绍了很多关于苗族钢铁工人的模范事迹。我根据李厂长的介绍，访问了一些在钢铁战线上大显神手的苗家新英雄。
          苗家的新英雄
    年轻的苗族钢铁工人石老世是“共青团炉”的炉前工。11月3日，石老世炉中的铁水和渣子凝结在一起，成为“牛脑壳”了（苗族工人把这种凝固物叫做牛脑壳），塞在炉中取不出来。
    适巧，11月5日是“小鞍钢”的“卫星日”，他怕赶不上放“卫星”，非常焦急。当炉内还热气腾腾、炉底还烫脚的时候，他穿着湿透了的单衣和草鞋，钻进炉中，使劲敲打“牛脑壳”。他每半小时出来休息一次，衣服被烤干了，又用水湿透衣服再钻进去。就这样，他连续工作了五个小时，才把“牛脑壳”全部取出。
    在这五小时的忘我劳动中，他头热晕了，脚烫伤了，领导上要他休息，他不去，又积极地参加迎接“卫星日”的准备工作，一直到他的炉子在5日一点钟流出光闪闪的铁水时，他才放心地去休息。
    记者在炼铁炉前见到了这位朴实的苗家钢铁工人，他正满头大汗在炉前紧张劳动，苗家的另外一些工人热情地告诉记者：我们的石老世已被评为甲等模范了，真光荣！
    在钢铁基地上，还流传着另一个动人的故事：苗族工人石成英的炉子和一个妇女炉竞赛的时候，妇女炉有了“牛脑壳”，铁水不流了，风箱也不通了，妇女们急得没有办法。
    这时，石成英和他的同伴们就主动地帮助妇女炉取“牛脑壳”。石成英脱掉上衣，紧靠炉口劳动。炉中喷出火花，把他的脸上和身上烫出不少血泡，他也不管。他把别人的困难当作自己的困难，一心一意地帮助别人。经过半天的努力，妇女炉就正常生产了。竞赛结果，妇女炉日产量达到一千四百斤，比石成英炉子的产量高，红旗飘扬在妇女炉上。
    石成英的炉子虽没有得到红旗，但他们同样高兴。他们说，只要能为国家多出铁，不管在谁的炉子前都是一样劳动。钢铁基地的党委会认为石成英的炉子是政治挂帅的炉子，称为思想红旗。
            两个女滕树梅
    在钢铁基地上，苗家妇女也不示弱，无论在炉前工中，在鼓风手中，在捶矿手中，都有苗家的模范妇女。她们和男人一样能干，并干得很出色。
    在捶矿班，有两个苗家妇女，名字都叫滕树梅。一个二十九岁，高一些，就叫大滕树梅，一个十九岁，矮一些，就叫小滕树梅。她俩都是捶矿能手。
    一天，小滕树梅捶了一千五百斤矿石，而别人一天只捶五百斤到八百斤。
    有人问她：你怎么能捶这么多？
    她很直率地回答他说：捶的矿石多，铁水就流得多，怎么能不多捶呢？
    小滕，她十二岁时就没有父母，那时她还有一个八岁的妹妹和一个六岁的弟弟，完全依靠政府发救济金和救济粮生活。合作化后，她家是五保户，有吃有穿，无忧无虑。成立人民公社后，她的妹妹在幼儿园工作，弟弟在小学读书，她到“小鞍钢”捶矿。她满怀激动的心情对记者说，不是共产党，我们苗家的孤儿那能有今天。
    大滕树梅的干劲更大，他曾在一天中捶了一千八百斤矿石。她在捶矿车间常高声唱道：我的手比铁还硬，我的心比钢还坚，要捶遍万宝山，要捶起钢墙铁壁，要捶到解放台湾，要捶走美帝野心狼。”
    大滕树梅在团结方面、吃苦耐劳方面都是很出色的，捶矿车间来了新工人，她都热情地关心照顾，有时，她先到捶矿车间把场子打扫得干干净净，让新工人舒舒服服地捶矿。有的工人病了，她主动地到卫生所领药，打饭给病人吃，耐心地照顾病人。她的事迹是显著的，工人们评她为特等模范。小滕也光荣地在钢铁战线上参加了共青团。
    记者在访问她们时，小滕树梅很高兴地向记者谈她前天入团宣誓时的情况。大滕树梅紧接着说，我年纪大一些，不能入团，但我有决心争取参加共产党。她又笑容满面对小滕说：过去以社为家，现在以厂为家。
                ×  ×  ×
    离开小排吾的那一天，记者在访问苗族工人时，在工地上看到一首歌颂小排吾的诗，诗中有两段这样写道：
        前日我打排吾过，  荆棘野草满山坡，
        炊烟依稀行人少，  山前山后寂寞多。
        今日我打排吾过，  开矿英雄满山坡，
        铁水奔流如水涨，  工人高唱超英歌。
    正如这首诗中所说的，苗岭中的小排吾在大炼钢铁的热潮中，确已涌现出大批的英雄模范人物。11月间，工人进行了评比，共评出五百多名模范人物，钢铁基地的共青团委员会在11月间，共吸收了八十多名优秀的青年钢铁工人入了团。在这些模范人物和优秀青年中，绝大部分是苗族钢铁工人。由此也可看到，苗族钢铁工人在祖国的大家庭中已迅速地成长起来了，他们在各族人民为钢而战的共同任务中，将会献出更大的力量。
