Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 6th. Guangzhou rowing athletes Huang Guoqin (student of South China Normal College, 21 years old), Fang Qingsi (student of Guangzhou No. 6 Middle School, 18 years old) and coxswain Zhang Yanchang (student of Guangzhou No. 4 Middle School, 19 years old) in a double sculls with coxswain boat, today morning in the Guangzhou rowing test race, with a time of eight minutes, twenty-one seconds and two tenths, finished the 2,000-meter distance, exceeding the sixteenth Olympic Games champion team - the United States team's record of eight minutes, twenty-six seconds and one tenth. These three athletes only started learning rowing in March this year, and have been working together for just over a month. Because they study diligently and practice hard, they quickly achieved excellent results.
	The test was held on the Pearl River near the Guangzhou East Rowing Club. The course was repeatedly surveyed and verified by the Geography Department of South China Normal College. During the competition, the average river flow rate was 0.038 meters per second (measured with a rotating cup current meter), with a level 1 wind blowing diagonally. After strict inspection by national referee Lei Ruilin, the result was acknowledged on the spot.

    广州创划船新纪录
    据新华社广州6日电  广州市划船运动员黄国钦（华南师范学院学生，二十一岁）、方清泗（广州第六中学学生，十八岁）和舵手张炎昌（广州第四中学学生，十九岁）组成的双人单桨有舵手赛艇，今天上午在广州市划船测验赛中，以八分二十一秒二的时间划完二千公尺航距，超过了十六届奥运会冠军队——美国队创造的八分二十六秒一的成绩。这三名运动员今年3月才开始学习划船运动，三人合作也不过一个多月。因为他们勤学苦练，迅速获得了优异成绩。
    测验是在广州市东面划船俱乐部附近的珠江上举行的。赛程经过华南师范学院地理系反复勘测核定，比赛时江水平均每秒流速○·○三八公尺（用旋杯式流速器测定），斜吹着一级风。国家裁判雷瑞林经过严格检定后，当场承认这项成绩。
