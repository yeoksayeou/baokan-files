Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: Comrade Liu Lantao, head of the Chinese Laboring People's Delegation to the Soviet Union for the 41st Anniversary of the October Revolution, delivered a report to the people of the capital today on his visit to the Soviet Union. The report meeting was jointly held by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. More than 1,200 representatives from all walks of life in the capital attended the meeting, including Li Dequan and Shao Lizi, vice-presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, Qian Junrui, secretary-general, Ge Baoquan, deputy secretary-general, Liao Mosha, vice-president of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and some members of the delegation to the Soviet Union.

Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, and responsible embassy staff members were also invited to attend the report meeting.

In his report, Comrade Liu Lantao first talked about the delegation's visit to the Soviet Union. He said that in contact with the Soviet people, the lofty internationalist spirit of the Soviet people and their ardent love and friendship for the Chinese people deeply moved us and left a deep impression.

Then, he reported on the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in industrial and agricultural construction and cultural and scientific undertakings. He said that in the past forty-one years, the Soviet people have built their motherland into a socialist power with a highly technical industry, a strong collectivized and mechanized agriculture, and advanced culture and science in the world. He also said that under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party, the heroic Soviet people, along the road pointed out by the great Lenin, have achieved extremely brilliant achievements through arduous struggle and enthusiastic labor, demonstrating the infinite vitality of the socialist system; indicating that the road opened up by the great October Socialist Revolution is the victorious road that all mankind must take.

Comrade Liu Lantao continued, "During our visit to the Soviet Union, we happened to encounter the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's announcement of the 'Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965'." This great plan, which made all progressive mankind rejoice and shocked imperialism and all reactionaries, unfolded a magnificent and grand picture of communism before us.

Comrade Liu Lantao said that the Chinese people, like the people of the world, are infinitely happy and encouraged by this huge step of the Soviet Union towards communism. We firmly believe that the great Soviet people will surely complete and overfulfill the new plan victoriously, just as they victoriously completed and overfulfilled the past five-year plans. In the near future, the Soviet Union will surely leave the most developed capitalist country in the world, the United States, far behind. No force in the world can stop the heroic pace of the Soviet people towards communism!

Comrade Liu Lantao said: The Soviet Union was the first to build socialism, and now it is the vanguard of the transition to communism. It attracts and encourages the people of the world with its brilliant example of building socialism and communism. In the future, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continue to strengthen the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so as to accelerate China's socialist construction. Seriously studying the Soviet Union, studying the experience of Soviet socialist and communist construction, and creatively applying these experiences in accordance with China's specific conditions is the unwavering policy of the Chinese people and an important condition for accelerating China's socialist construction.

Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, also spoke at the meeting. He said: The visit of the Chinese Laboring People's Delegation to the Soviet Union for the 41st Anniversary of the October Revolution has made a new contribution to further strengthening the cooperation and unity between the people of the Soviet Union and China. He also wished that the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China would last forever.

Today, photos of the activities of the Chinese Laboring People's Delegation to the Soviet Union for the 41st Anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation in China, as well as charts of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, were also exhibited at the meeting.

    刘澜涛同志作访苏报告
    强调认真学习苏联的建设经验
    据新华社25日讯  中国劳动人民庆祝十月革命节四十一周年赴苏观礼团团长刘澜涛今天向首都各界人民作访苏报告。这个报告会是由中苏友好协会总会和北京市中苏友好协会联合举行的。参加大会的有首都各界代表一千二百多人，中苏友好协会总会副会长李德全、邵力子，秘书长钱俊瑞，副秘书长戈宝权，北京市中苏友好协会副会长廖沫沙和赴苏观礼团的部分团员等参加了报告会。
    苏联驻我国大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫及使馆负责工作人员也应邀参加了报告会。
    刘澜涛同志在报告中首先谈到了代表团在苏联访问的情况。他说，在和苏联人民的接触中，苏联人民的崇高的国际主义精神和对中国人民炽热的友爱和情谊，使我们受到极大的感动，留下了深刻的印象。
    接着，他报告了苏联在工农业建设和文化科学事业等方面所取得的辉煌成就。他说，四十一年来，苏联人民已把他们的祖国建设成为一个具有高度技术水平的社会主义工业、强大的集体化与机械化的农业和世界上先进的文化与科学的社会主义强国。他还说，英雄的苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党领导下，沿着伟大列宁所指出的道路，经过艰苦卓绝的斗争，以热情的劳动所取得的极其光辉的成就，显示出社会主义制度的无限生命力；表明伟大十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路是全人类必然要走的胜利道路。
    刘澜涛同志接着说，在我们访问苏联期间，恰好遇到苏共中央公布“1959年—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”。这个使全世界进步人类欢欣鼓舞，使帝国主义和一切反动派震惊的伟大计划，在我们面前展开了一幅瑰丽雄伟的共产主义的图景。
    刘澜涛同志说，我们中国人民和全世界人民一样，对于苏联走向共产主义的这个巨大步骤，感到无限欢欣鼓舞。我们深信，伟大的苏联人民一定能像胜利完成和超额完成过去的几个五年计划一样，胜利地完成和超额完成新的计划。在不久的将来，苏联一定会把世界上最发达的资本主义国家——美国，远远地抛在后面，世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡苏联人民向共产主义前进的英雄步伐！
    刘澜涛同志说：苏联首先建成了社会主义，现在又是向共产主义过渡的先锋队。它以建设社会主义和共产主义的光辉榜样，吸引和鼓舞着全世界人民。今后我们必须遵循毛主席的教导，继续加强学习苏联的先进经验，以加速中国的社会主义建设。认真学习苏联，研究苏联社会主义和共产主义建设的经验，并按照我国的具体条件创造性地运用这些经验，是我国人民坚定不移的方针，也是加速我国社会主义建设的重要条件。
    苏联驻我国大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫也在会上讲了话。他说：中国劳动人民庆祝十月革命四十一周年赴苏观礼团在苏联的访问，对进一步加强苏中两国人民的合作和团结，作了新的贡献。他并祝中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万古长青。
    在会场上，今天还展出了中国劳动人民庆祝十月革命四十一周年赴苏观礼团在苏联和苏中友好协会代表团在中国的访问活动的照片，以及苏联七年计划图表。
