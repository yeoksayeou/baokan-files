Hefei Dispatch from our newspaper: Lu'an Special District in Anhui Province is extensively establishing various vocational schools jointly across all sectors and people's communes. This new type of vocational school allows peasants to rotate and learn various scientific technologies and improve their education, cultivating a large number of technical personnel for the communes.

To meet the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Lu'an Special District, while vigorously developing public middle schools and private agricultural middle schools, actively mobilized factories, farms (forestry), enterprises, and institutions to jointly establish schools with the communes. During the process of establishing schools, the party and government leaders of each unit personally took charge and also served as principals, mobilizing technicians, workers, and cadres to serve as teachers, squeezing out offices, dormitories, and clubhouses as school buildings. The communes, based on production needs, sent peasants who had graduated from literacy classes and high school graduates in the countryside who participated in production labor to enroll. In the early stages of running the schools, the communes also contributed some money as operating expenses. In just over three months, the entire special district has established 59 schools for electricians, agricultural machinery, horticulture, tea, forestry, water conservancy, fishery, health, meteorology, postal and telecommunications, and accounting, with an enrollment of 8,000 people. The courses in these schools include politics, language, arithmetic, and specialized technology. In terms of learning and work arrangements, a part-work, part-study system is implemented. The schooling system includes one year, two years, and three years. Party and League members are organized together for organizational activities. Graduates are assigned to return to their original communes, with the exception of a very few who stay at the school or factory. In this way, each school sends technical personnel to the communes every year, and peasants enroll every year.

In the process of running schools, some are run by one unit and a commune, while others are jointly run by several units and the commune. For example, in order to achieve electrification, the Huoshan County Party Committee came forward to organize communes to jointly raise funds. In the early stage of running the school, the commune paid 15 yuan in tuition per student per semester, and the commune sent 129 students. The Foziling Reservoir Power Station vacated more than 20 rooms as school buildings. Engineers, technicians, and workers from the power station served as teachers, and the Huoshan Junior Electric School was born. This school teaches classes in the morning and participates in labor in the afternoon. The course schedule is: two class hours of politics per week, six class hours of language, six class hours of mathematics, six class hours of technical courses, and three class hours of physical education and music. Every afternoon, 20 people go to the electrical machinery factory for an internship of five to eight hours under the guidance of veteran workers. Thirty people go to the power station for an internship every week. After the internship, discussions are organized to closely integrate theory and practice. After two years of graduation, the technical level of the students can generally install, repair, and maintain electrical equipment, and become technicians and workers in rural power stations. This school is actively preparing to build an electrical equipment factory. This factory will produce motors, generators, copper wires, yarn-covered wires, locally made silicon steel sheets, lamp holders, and various switches, manufacturing various equipment for the electrification of the entire county. Students at the Forestry School established by the Huoshan Forestry Farm not only combine theory with practice, but also solve the difficulty of the forestry farm lacking labor. The Rural Work Department of the Huoqiu County Party Committee organized the County Agriculture Bureau, Water Conservancy Bureau, Farm, and Fishery to establish eight branch schools for rice, wheat, water conservancy, fishery, horticulture, and accounting. In addition to interning at farms and fisheries, students also built new farms, horticultural farms, and fisheries, combining teaching, labor, and scientific research. The Huoqiu County Health Section, Hospital, Pharmaceutical Company, and Anti-epidemic Station collectively raised funds and the commune sent 150 students to run a health school. The teaching content of this school includes courses in politics, language, mathematics, physics and chemistry, bacteriology, drugs, physiological anatomy, common diseases, nursing, acupuncture, and physical diagnosis. The hospital ward is the classroom, and the patient's treatment process is a living textbook. After two years of graduation, students can generally handle common diseases and master knowledge and skills such as bandaging, acupuncture, and nursing.

There are many benefits to industries and communes jointly running schools. First, it tapped the potential of factories, farms (forestry), enterprises, and institutions to run schools, developed education quickly, well, and economically, cultivated various technical talents for the communes, supported socialist construction, and also solved the difficulty of various units lacking labor. As the technical level of students continues to improve, they replace some of the work of workers, and workers can free up time to learn culture and further improve their technical level. The second is that education and productive labor are closely integrated, so that education and production can be developed simultaneously. For example, the 15 schools established in Huoshan County have established 43 various factories. In particular, peasants, with the help of workers, learn various technologies from labor, making peasants both workers, farmers, and students.

    开辟农民学习多种技术的途径
    六安专区工厂企业和人民公社联合开办各种职业学校
    本报合肥讯  安徽省六安专区行行业业和人民公社联合大办各种职业学校。这种新型的职业学校，可使农民轮流学习各种科学技术和提高文化，为公社培养大批技术人员。
    为了满足工农业生产大跃进的需要，六安专区在大力发展公立中学和民办农业中学的同时，积极发动工厂、农（林）场、企业和机关联合公社办学。在办学过程中，各单位的党政负责人亲自动手，并兼任校长，发动技术人员、工人和干部兼任教师，挤出办公室、宿舍和俱乐部作校舍。公社根据生产的需要，保送扫盲毕业的农民和在乡参加生产劳动的高小毕业生入学。在办学初期，公社还拿出一点钱作为办学经费。全专区在三个多月中，已办起电工、农业机械、园艺、茶业、林业、水利、渔业、卫生、气象、邮电、会计等学校五十九所，入学人数达八千人。这些学校的课程设有政治、语文、算术、专业技术等。在学习与劳动安排上，实行半工半读。在学制上，有一年、二年，也有三年的。党团员编在一起过组织生活。毕业生的分配是，除极少数留校、留厂工作外，其他全部回原公社。这样，各校年年向公社输送技术人员，年年有农民入学。
    在办学过程中，有的是一个单位和公社办起来的，有的是几个单位联合起来和公社举办的。如霍山县为了实现电气化，由县委出面组织公社联合筹集资金，办学初期，公社为每个学生每学期出十五元学费，公社保送一百二十九名学生，佛子岭水库发电站腾出二十多间房屋作校舍，电站的工程师、技术员、工人兼任教师，霍山初级电校便诞生了。这所学校，上午教课，下午参加劳动。课程安排是：每周政治二教时，语文六教时，数学六教时，技术课六教时，体育和音乐三教时。每天下午有二十人在老工人带领下到电工机械厂实习五至八小时。每周有三十人到电站实习，实习后组织讨论，使理论和实践紧密结合。二年毕业后，学员的技术水平一般能安装、检修、维护电气设备，成为农村电站的技术员和工人。这所学校正在积极筹建电工器材厂。这个厂将生产电动机、发电机、铜丝、纱包线、土制矽钢片、灯头和各种开关，为全县电气化制造各种设备。霍山林场创办的林业学校学生，边学习、边劳动、边试验，不但理论与实践结合，而且解决了林场缺乏劳动力的困难。霍丘县委农村工作部组织县农业局、水利局、农场、渔场创办了水稻、小麦、水利、渔业、园艺、会计等八个分校。学生除在农场、渔场实习外，还新建了农场、园艺场、渔场等，把教学、劳动和科学研究结合起来。霍丘县卫生科、卫生院、医药公司、防疫站等单位集体筹资，由公社保送一百五十名学员，办了一所卫生学校。这所学校的教学内容有政治、语文、数学、理化、细菌学、药物、生理解剖、常见疾病、护理、针灸、物理诊断等课程。医院病房就是课堂，病人的治疗过程就是活教材。二年毕业后，学生一般能处理常见疾病，掌握包扎、针灸、护理等知识和技术。
    行行业业和公社联合办学的好处很多。首先是发掘了工厂、农（林）场、企业和机关办学的潜力，在不增加国家开支的条件下，多快好省地发展教育事业，为公社培养各种技术人才，支援了社会主义建设，还解决了各单位缺乏劳动力的困难。随着学生技术水平不断的提高，代替工人一部分工作，工人就可以抽出时间学习文化和进一步提高技术水平。第二是教育和生产劳动紧密结合起来，使教育和生产同时获得发展。如霍山县办起的十五所学校，就办起各种工厂四十三个，特别是农民在工人的帮助下，从劳动中学会各种技术，使农民亦工亦农亦学。
