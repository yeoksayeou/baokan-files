One Year of Diligent Training, Flowers Blossom for Ten Thousand Miles
Central Government Cadres Sent Down for Labor Achieve Fruitful Results

(Our dispatch) More than 20,000 cadres from central government departments have achieved significant gains through labor training over the past year or so. During their labor, they established deep connections with workers and peasants, who warmly praised them as "good cadres sent by Chairman Mao." The year's practice has made the sent-down cadres realize that only by truly becoming ordinary laborers can they feel genuine honor and the greatest inner joy.

Central government departments, including Party, government, and people's organizations, sent down a total of over 25,000 cadres last winter and this spring, distributing them to factories and rural areas in more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions. The Party has repeatedly emphasized that all Communist Party members and all working cadres, regardless of their position or seniority, should place themselves in the same equal position as ordinary laborers. Except for the elderly and infirm, all should participate in some physical labor to better improve the relationship between leaders and the masses, strengthen the labor concept of the vast number of cadres and intellectuals, and gradually combine mental and physical labor. To promote this fine tradition, the Party adopted various effective measures. Sending cadres down for labor training was one of the important measures taken by the Party during the rectification movement last winter and this spring. At that time, nearly one million cadres across the country were sent down to rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises to participate in physical labor. This measure was of great significance in improving the ideological style of cadres, strengthening the relationship between leaders and the masses, overcoming bureaucratism, and enhancing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working masses. Based on practical experience, various units will continue to adopt this approach as circumstances permit in the future. In addition, they will adopt diverse methods to ensure that cadres regularly and universally have opportunities for labor training. This training will last for no less than one month per year for all working cadres except the elderly and infirm.

An Extraordinary Year

Recently, the sent-down cadres from central government departments have successively concluded their labor training and have been transferred back to their original departments or assigned to new positions. The sent-down cadres regard their year of grassroots training as an "extraordinary year." After a year of intense labor training during the Great Leap Forward, after living, eating, and working alongside workers and peasants, they overcame difficulties in life, labor, and ideology. The vast majority of them withstood the test and gained rich rewards. Many people believe that "one year of labor training is better than ten years of reading books." Some regard the place where they were sent down as their "second hometown" and consider the title of "sent-down cadre" as an honorable one. People's thoughts and feelings have undergone great changes.

Overcoming Difficulties in Life and Labor

It is impossible to ignore the difficulties encountered by sent-down cadres in labor training. Many people had never labored before. They enthusiastically requested to be sent down in the first batch, and they arrived in the countryside during the freezing winter with snow and ice. At that time, they felt very "unaccustomed" to life and labor. However, they were determined to overcome this "unaccustomedness." Having experienced difficulties, they were no longer afraid of them but despised them. More than 300 cadres from the Chinese Academy of Sciences were sent down to Jingxing County, Hebei Province. This area is mountainous, and it has suffered continuous natural disasters in the past two years, making the lives of the masses very difficult. In particular, the local water supply is extremely difficult, and the masses regard water as precious as food. Sometimes, they need to carry water from 20 miles away. Such a place would obviously cause great inconvenience to intellectual cadres, most of whom were graduates of universities and middle schools and had grown up in cities. However, once they threw themselves into the mass movement, the enthusiasm of the masses inspired them. In addition, through continuous self-education, they finally conquered the difficulties in practice and cultivated a spirit of hard work and plain living. Over the past year, 168 of them have been rated as various models and labor activists, and four others have been honorably elected as representatives to the township People's Congress, and more than ten have been selected as youth activists in building socialism. When more than 2,000 sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Culture arrived in the countryside, it was the peak season for water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and physical labor was very heavy. Those sent down to the Northeast region also had to fight against the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius and wind and snow. Many cadres initially had cracked hands and swollen shoulders, sore backs and legs. At that time, they were determined to withstand the test, and it did not take long for them to overcome the difficulties in life and labor. Finally, when the sent-down cadres were about to be transferred back, some of them expressed their unwillingness to leave the countryside, and many farmers even made requests to keep them. More than 80% of the more than 500 cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building sent down to Xinxiang have received awards and honors. At first, they did not know how to labor. After arduous training, more than 190 people were selected as models, and some became technicians for rice and cotton.

Received Vivid Political Education

The most important gain was the training in class stand and class viewpoint. Some sent-down cadres had never been to the countryside. Their understanding of peasants, grassroots cadres, and grassroots work often came from literary works such as "The Hurricane" and "Three Mile Bay." They compared the things in real life with the typical things portrayed in movies and novels. Sometimes, they could not distinguish right from wrong, grasp the mainstream, or distinguish between advantages and disadvantages. In the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, some cadres from intellectual backgrounds showed a vague class stand at the beginning. For example, on the issue of eating, some well-to-do middle peasants and rich peasants deliberately did not give the sent-down cadres enough to eat. Some hid the grain but rushed to buy bran and tofu dregs for the sent-down cadres. Their purpose was to undermine the Party's grain policy. In this case, some sent-down cadres could not distinguish right from wrong and could not resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to expose saboteurs. This struggle in real life was the most vivid political education class for the sent-down cadres. Cadres from the Ministry of Public Security sent down to Hejian, Nanpi, and other counties in Hebei Province encountered such a situation: poor and hired peasant landlords cared for them meticulously, as close as family members, while some well-to-do middle peasants and landlord and rich peasant elements disliked the sent-down cadres and deliberately did not give them enough to eat. These two attitudes deepened the cadres' class feelings and strengthened their stand. After being educated by real life, some sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Health took the initiative to criticize the influence of their exploitative class families during heart-to-heart talks, saying that they must cultivate their class feelings in the future and truly become ordinary laborers.

Redness Does Not Abandon Expertise

Significantly, through labor practice, the sent-down cadres gained unexpected rewards in the combination of redness and expertise and the connection between theory and practice. Many people learned real skills in labor training in combination with their own business and gained a deeper understanding of the Party's policies. Sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building played a very good role in spreading and improving technology and in implementing the "small-scale indigenous groups" policy to vigorously run township and community industries. The cadres from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry sent down to the suburbs of Zhengzhou City helped the masses build 168 small factories, most of which have been put into production. The sent-down cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building played a very good role in helping the people of Jixian County, Henan Province, develop local industry. Some cadres from machinery factories praised, "Sent-down cadres really hold up half the sky for us." The sent-down cadres from the Chinese Academy of Sciences carried out science popularization work in Hebei Province, and some even discovered more than 40 kinds of wild fibers. The sent-down cadres from the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau helped Cang County establish a broadcasting network throughout the county. The sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Health carried out health and medical work. The masses gratefully said that the sent-down cadres can both labor and save people. The sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Education launched social work centered on educational "experimental fields" in Jishan County, Shanxi Province. Some 60-year-old men were also attracted by these teachers and automatically participated in the classes every day. Some of the cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building who were sent down to Hunan taught at the university they ran themselves after working at night, wearing straw sandals and carrying rice pots, traveling thirty miles back and forth. The sent-down cadres from the Ministry of Public Security made very good achievements in mobilizing the masses to carry out mass-based public security work. In Dongguang County, Hebei Province, an old case of killing 40 people that had not been solved for 15 years was solved this time by a sent-down cadre from the Ministry of Public Security with the help of the masses, and seven guns were seized. These facts prove that sending down for labor training is not "abandoning expertise for redness." In fact, only by connecting with reality and connecting with the masses is it the real way to combine redness and expertise.

Established Deep Feelings with the Masses

About a year of grassroots life has left most sent-down cadres with beautiful memories, especially the deep feelings they have established with the masses. In daily life, many old landlady like they were their own children cared about the sent-down cadres, asking them if they were cold and warm, secretly mending their clothes, covering them with quilts on cold nights, sending them umbrellas on rainy days, and always saving good things to eat with the sent-down cadres. In many places, when the sent-down cadres were transferred away, the masses reluctantly sent them off. Some even made good meals and put on new clothes, insisting on treating the sent-down cadres to a farewell feast like they were celebrating a festival. Some old farmers in Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, cried when they bid farewell to the sent-down cadres. They said, "We were not so sad when we sent our sons to join the army back then." This simple and deep class feeling of the farmers truly moved many people. Some sent-down cadres said that the reason why they were able to overcome difficulties and achieve gains in labor training was inseparable from the care and love of the masses and the support of the masses. The working people became their true teachers and helpful friends.

The work of ideological transformation is long-term and arduous. After transferring back the sent-down cadres, many agencies conducted inspections and summaries, pointing out the direction of the sent-down cadres' future efforts. The "almost" transformation and complacency emerging in individual sent-down cadres have aroused people's vigilance. (Attached picture)

    一年勤锻炼  花开万里红
    中央机关二万多名干部下放劳动收获丰硕
    本报讯  中央机关的下放干部经过一年左右的劳动锻炼，取得了重要的收获，他们在劳动中同工人农民建立了感情，农民热情地赞扬他们是“毛主席派来的好干部”。一年的实践，使下放干部们体会到，只有在真正成为一个普通劳动者的时候，才会感到真正的光荣和内心最大的愉快。
    中央机关包括党、政府和人民团体各单位，去冬今春共下放了二万五千多名干部，分布在二十多个省、自治区的工厂和农村。党曾一再强调，一切共产党员，全体在职干部，不论职位高低，资格新老，都应当把自己放在同普通劳动者一样的、同等的地位，除了年老体弱者以外，都要参加一部分体力劳动，以便更好地改善领导者同群众的关系，加强广大干部和广大知识分子的劳动观念，使脑力劳动和体力劳动逐步结合。为了发扬这种优良传统，党采取了各种有效的办法，下放干部劳动锻炼，就是党在去冬今春的整风运动中所采取的重要措施之一。当时全国有近百万干部下放到农村和工矿企业参加体力劳动，这个措施对于改进干部的思想作风，密切领导和群众的关系，克服官僚主义，提高劳动群众的革命积极性，有着重要的意义。根据实践的经验，今后各单位还将根据情况继续采取这种作法；另外，还将采取多种多样的办法，使干部经常地普遍地得到劳动锻炼的机会，而这种锻炼，除去年老体弱者以外，所有在职干部每人每年将不少于一个月。
    不平凡的一年
    最近，中央机关的下放干部已陆续结束了劳动锻炼，分别调回原机关或分配到新的工作岗位。下放干部把基层锻炼的一年当作“不平凡的一年”，他们在经过了一年大跃进的紧张劳动锻炼，经过了同工人农民同吃、同住、同劳动，度过了生活关、劳动关和思想关，绝大多数人经受住了考验，得到了丰富的收获，许多人认为：“劳动锻炼一年，胜读十年书”，有的人把下放的地方当作“第二故乡”，把“下放干部”当作光荣的称号，人们的思想感情有了很大的转变。
    度过生活关劳动关
    不能忽视下放干部在劳动锻炼中所遇到的困难。许多人过去根本没有劳动过，他们满怀热情地涌跃地请求第一批下放，在天寒地冻、冰雪满天的季节，到了农村，当时首先在生活和劳动方面感到很大的“不习惯”。可是他们决心克服这种“不习惯”，经历了困难就不再害怕困难而藐视困难。中国科学院有三百多干部下放到河北省井陉县，这个地方是山区，前两年又连续遇到自然灾害，群众生活很艰苦，特别是当地吃水、用水极为困难，群众视水如粮，有时需要到二十里路以外去担水；这样一个地方对于大部分是大学和中学出身的从小在城市长大的知识分子干部来说，显然会使他们感到极大的不便。可是，一当他们投身于群众运动之中的时候，群众的干劲鼓舞了他们，再加上不断地自我教育，这样终于在实践中征服了困难，培养了艰苦朴素的作风，一年来他们被群众评为各种模范和劳动积极分子的有一百六十八人，另外还有四人被光荣地选举为乡人民代表大会的代表，有十多人被选为青年建设社会主义积极分子。文化部二千多下放干部到达农村时，正值水利积肥高潮，体力劳动很繁重，下放到东北地区的还要与零下20度的严寒及风雪搏斗，许多干部开始时手裂肩肿，腰酸腿痛；他们当时下定决心经受考验，没用多久就度过了生活关和劳动关。最后当下放干部要调回的时候，有的人表示不愿离开农村，不少农民还提出了挽留的要求。第一机械工业部下放到新乡的五百多干部，有80％以上得到过奖励和荣誉。开始时他们不会劳动，经过艰苦的锻炼以后，有一百九十多人被选为模范，有的当了水稻和棉花的技术员。
    受到生动的政治教育
    最重要的收获是在阶级立场、阶级观点方面的锻炼。有些下放干部从来没有到过农村，他们对于农民、基层干部和基层工作的认识，常常是从“暴风骤雨”、“三里湾”之类的文学作品中得来的，他们拿现实生活中的事物同电影、小说中塑造的典型事物相对比，有时对许多事情分不清是非，抓不住主流，辨不清利害。在农村两条道路的斗争中，有些知识分子出身的干部在开始时表现阶级立场模糊，例如在吃饭问题上，有的富裕中农和富农故意不给下放干部吃饱，有的把粮食藏起来却抢购粉渣、豆腐渣给下放干部吃。他们的目的就是要破坏党的粮食政策。在这种情况下，有的下放干部就分不清是非，不能坚决地依靠贫农和下中农来揭露破坏分子。这种现实生活中的斗争，是下放干部最生动的政治教育课，公安部下放到河北省河间、南皮等县的干部遇到这样情况：贫雇农房东对他们关怀备至，亲如家人，一些富裕中农和地主、富农分子则嫌下放干部碍眼，故意不给吃饱。这样两种态度就更加深了干部们的阶级感情，更加坚定了立场。卫生部有的下放干部在受到现实生活的教育以后，主动在交心时批判了自己剥削阶级家庭给予自己的影响，表示今后一定要好好培养自己的阶级感情，真正做一个普通劳动者。
    红不废专
    有意义的是下放干部通过劳动的实践，在红与专的结合，理论和实践的联系上，得到了他们没有意料到的收获，许多人在劳动锻炼中结合自己的业务，学到了真正的本领，对党的政策有了进一步的体会。冶金工业部和第一机械工业部的下放干部，在传播和改进技术方面，在贯彻“小土群”方针大办乡社工业方面，都发挥了很好作用。冶金部下放到郑州市郊的干部，共帮助群众建立了一百六十八个小厂，多数已投入生产。一机部的下放干部在帮助河南汲县的人民发展地方工业方面，发挥了很好的作用，有些机械厂的干部赞扬说，“下放干部真是给我们顶了半个天”。中国科学院在河北省的下放干部开展了科学普及工作，有的还研究发现了四十多种野生纤维。广播事业局的下放干部帮助沧县全县建立了广播网。卫生部的下放干部开展了卫生医疗工作，群众感激地说，下放干部既会劳动，又能救人。教育部的下放干部在山西省稷山县展开了以教育“试验田”为中心的社会工作，有些六十岁的老头也被这些教员吸引去了，每天自动去参加听课。第一机械工业部下放到湖南的干部，有的在夜晚劳动之余，穿着草鞋，提着饭罐，来回赶三十里路去给他们自己办的大学教书。公安部的下放干部在发动群众开展群众性的治安保卫工作方面，做出了很好的成绩。河北省东光县有一件十五年未破获的杀害四十条人命的老案子，这次由公安部一个下放干部在群众的帮助下破获了，并且缴获了七支枪。这种种事实证明，下放劳动锻炼并不是“以红废专”，其实只有联系实际联系群众以后，才是红专相结合的真正途径。
    同群众建立深厚感情
    一年左右的基层生活，给大多数下放干部留下了美好的回忆，特别是他们不能忘怀同群众建立的深厚感情。在日常生活中，许多房东老大娘如同对自己儿女一样关心下放干部，问寒问暖，偷偷地给下放干部缝补衣服，寒夜给盖好被子，雨天给送伞，有了好东西总是留着同下放干部一起吃。许多地方下放干部在调走时，群众恋恋不舍地欢送他们，有的还专门做了好饭菜，换上新衣服，同过节一样强要给下放干部饯行。河北省交河县有的老农民在送别下放干部时哭了，他们说：“当年送儿子参军，也没有这样难过过。”农民们的这种朴素深厚的阶级感情，使许多人真正地感动了，有的下放干部说，他之所以能够在劳动锻炼中克服困难，取得收获，是同群众的关心和爱护，同群众给予的力量支持分不开的。劳动人民成了他们真正的良师和益友。
    思想改造的工作是长期的艰巨的，许多机关在调回下放干部以后，都进行了检查总结，指出下放干部今后努力的方向，个别下放干部那种正在露头的改造“差不多”的思想和骄傲自满情绪，已经引起人们的警惕。（附图片）
