A Program to Advance Towards Communism
The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan ⑦
Great Agricultural Development Products More Abundant

Increase in Production Speed Closely Following Industry

The major sign of the great agricultural development in the Soviet Union in recent years is the significantly accelerated increase in agricultural output, closely following the pace of industrial output growth. From 1954 to 1957, the average annual growth rate of the Soviet Union's total agricultural output was 7.1% (compared to only 1.1% in the United States). This average rate is equivalent to the planned growth rate of total industrial output in 1957.

This year, the Soviet Union's grain harvest is another bumper crop, exceeding the highest historical yield record of 1956. The Soviet Union's wheat harvest is twice as large as that of the United States. Sugar beets and cotton have also had bumper harvests this year. The sugar beet harvest is more than twice as large as that of the United States. Other crops such as barley, rye, potatoes, and flax also have larger harvests than the United States.

Why has the Soviet Union's agricultural production achieved such tremendous results in such a short period? It is mainly because the Soviet Union has taken a series of major measures since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, such as reclaiming wasteland, improving the agricultural planning system, and reorganizing machine tractor stations.

Production Levels Will Surpass the United States

The main task of the Seven-Year Plan in agriculture is to further increase agricultural production to meet the people's needs for the most important foods and to drastically increase the output of cash crops. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will surpass the current level of the United States in terms of total output of important agricultural products and output per capita. The plan stipulates that in the final year, 1965, the total value of agricultural output will increase by approximately 70%. The main line of agricultural development remains to vigorously expand the foundation of overall agricultural production – grain output, which will increase to 10 to 11 billion poods.

The Seven-Year Plan pays close attention to increasing crop yields per unit area and land utilization. To increase yields per unit area, three times the current amount of chemical fertilizers will be produced in 1965. The output of the most important agricultural products per 100 hectares of agricultural land will greatly increase in 1965, exceeding the current output of the United States.

Production Will Be Specialized in Various Regions

Due to the reclamation of wasteland and the establishment of strong grain bases in the eastern part of the Soviet Union, various regions of the country have gradually begun to develop towards agricultural specialization. For example, many regions of Ukraine, Moldova, and the North Caucasus, which were once the main bases of grain production, have expanded the area sown to wheat and are preparing to specialize in the production of sugar beets, various varieties of corn, as well as livestock products, fruits, and grapes. Collective farms and state farms in the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian Soviet Republics have begun to specialize in the production of meat and milk. Collective farms and state farms in the Moscow Oblast have begun to develop towards specialization in the production of potatoes, vegetables, meat, and milk. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that specialization will be further implemented and the allocation of agricultural production will be improved, because this can ensure stable bumper harvests of agricultural crops, so as to smoothly achieve the specified quantities.

The Seven-Year Plan also stipulates that while sharply increasing agricultural production, it is necessary to improve socialist relations of production, so that collective farm ownership and ownership by the whole people tend to converge. (Attached table)

    向共产主义迈进的纲领
    苏联的七年计划⑦
    农业大发展  产品更丰富
    增产速度直追工业
    农业产量的增加速度大大加快，直追工业产量提高的速度——这就是苏联最近几年来农业大发展的主要标志。从1954年起到1957年的四年中，苏联农业生产总额的增长速度，每年平均为7.1％（美国仅为1.1％），这一平均速度已相当于1957年工业总产量计划的速度。
    今年苏联的谷物又是大丰收，超过了历史上最高丰产纪录的1956年。苏联小麦的收获量比美国大一倍。甜菜和棉花今年都获得丰收。甜菜的收获量超过美国两倍之多。其他如大麦、黑麦、马铃薯和亚麻的收获量也都超过美国。
    为什么苏联的农业生产在这短短的几年内获得了这样巨大的成绩呢？主要是因为苏联在苏共第二十次代表大会以后采取了一系列的重大措施，如开垦荒地，改进农业计划制度，改组机器拖拉机站等。
    生产水平将超美国
    七年计划在农业方面的主要任务，就是进一步提高农业生产来满足人民对于最重要食品的需要，并急剧地增加经济作物的产量。在七年计划结束时，在重要的农产品的总产量和按人口平均的产量方面，苏联将超过美国现在的水平。计划规定在最后一年，即1965年，农业总产值大约增加70％。农业发展的主要路线仍然是大力扩大整个农业生产的基础——谷物的产量，因此，谷物将增加为一百亿到一百一十亿普特。
    七年计划对于提高农作物单位面积产量和土地的使用，是非常注意的。为了提高单位面积的产量，1965年将生产三倍于现在的化学肥料。以一百公顷农业用地为单位的最主要的农产品产量在1965年将大大增加，超过美国的目前产量。
    各地生产将专业化
    由于在苏联东部开垦了荒地和建立了强大的谷物基地，苏联全国各地又逐步开始向农业专业化方向发展。例如，昔日是谷物生产主要基地的乌克兰、摩尔达维亚和北高加索的很多地区扩大了小麦播种面积，并准备专门生产甜菜、各种玉蜀黍品种，以及畜牧业产品、水果和葡萄。在立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚等加盟共和国的集体农庄和国营农场，已开始专门生产肉类和奶类。莫斯科州的集体农庄和国营农场开始向生产土豆、蔬菜、肉类、奶类的专业化方面发展。七年计划规定将进一步实行专业化和改善农业生产的配置，因为这可以保证农业作物获得稳定的丰收，以便顺利达到规定的数量。
    七年计划还规定，在急剧提高农业生产同时，将要改善社会主义的生产关系，使集体农庄所有制和全民所有制，趋于接近。（附图表）
