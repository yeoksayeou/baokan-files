    Going to the Fields Full of Vigor, Returning to Hot Meals and Fragrant Dishes
    Wulipai Commune Canteen Conducts In-Depth Inspection and Promotes Advanced Experiences

    (Our dispatch) The Wulipai People's Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, recently organized a force to conduct a major inspection of the work of public canteens throughout the commune. From the inspection, they summarized and promoted advanced experiences, earnestly solved existing problems, and further consolidated the commune, promoting production.

    This inspection was carried out under the direct leadership of the commune Party committee. The commune Party committee first gathered twenty-one brigade leaders and Party branch secretaries and held an on-site meeting at the Mao Wan canteen in the consolidated brigade. Through visits and interviews at this canteen, everyone realized that running public canteens well is directly related to doing a good job in production and consolidating the commune. The Mao Wan canteen, because each person planted three-tenths of a mu of vegetables, raised twenty-seven pigs and one hundred and thirty-one chickens and ducks, and ran a sauce garden and tofu workshop, also had people fishing in the river. Commune members ate three dishes and one soup per meal, meat once every half month (averaging five taels per person), and fish once every five days. As a result, commune members were very energetic when they worked. Their one hundred and seventeen laborers harvested six hundred and thirty-one mu of late rice. Originally, it was estimated that it would take six days to harvest, but it only took three and a half days. After seeing these facts, Zeng Haixiang, who used to say that the canteen had rice to cook and firewood to burn, and didn't need any leadership, also said: "In the past, the commune said it was necessary to strengthen leadership, and I always thought it was not necessary. Now I see that it is impossible not to strengthen leadership." On this basis, they then studied the content of the inspection: Are there many kinds of vegetables for commune members to eat, and does it taste good? Have enough vegetables been planted according to regulations? Are the canteen staff responsible? Is their attitude good? Are they healthy? Are the canteen tools complete? How is the cleaning and hygiene done? And it was agreed that the inspection should not only discover problems and solve problems, but also summarize and expand advanced experiences. Finally, a team of twenty-four inspectors was organized and divided into three groups to conduct inspections.

    The comrades of the inspection team went deep into the canteens, construction sites, and commune members' homes, held discussion meetings, conducted individual interviews, and solicited commune members' opinions on the public canteens. When they found advanced experiences there, they convened nearby canteens to hold on-site meetings to summarize and exchange experiences. When they found problems there, they discussed solutions with the commune members and solved them together. When the inspection team arrived at the Chengxiang canteen of Wuli Brigade, they found that commune members could eat hot meals and hot dishes whenever they returned, and had hot water for bathing and washing their feet, and boiled water to drink at any time. The reason was that the cooks cared about the commune members everywhere. They prepared a hot water pot, often boiling hot water, and also prepared steamers, putting the dishes in the steamers, so that no matter when the commune members returned, they would have hot dishes to eat. The inspection team convened the staff of five nearby canteens to hold an on-site meeting here, introduced their experience, and praised the exemplary behavior of the cooks. After returning, each canteen organized twenty-one carpenters that night to make steamers, and also sent people to buy pots for boiling hot water. From then on, commune members in these five canteens could also drink boiled water at any time. When the inspection team arrived at the Qipan canteen, they found eighteen commune members to hold a discussion meeting and solicit their opinions on the canteen. The commune members reported that the canteen staff was irresponsible and unsanitary, sometimes the rice was not cooked thoroughly, the bowls eaten in the last meal were not washed in the next meal, the rice was not washed clean, and the vegetables were not washed clean either. The commune members requested that Fang Yunying, a Communist Youth League member who was responsible and could cook, be appointed to the cooking work. After discussing with the inspection team and the small team cadres, they immediately agreed to their opinions, and together with the commune members, they cleaned the bowl cabinets, stoves, pots, dining tables and other tools, and cleared the garbage and ditches in front of and behind the house.

    The commune Party committee properly solved the various problems that were found in the inspection one by one. First of all, the leadership was further strengthened. The commune decided that the secretary should take the lead in grasping the work of living welfare. The general branch secretaries of the major brigades should grasp production with one hand and life with the other, and formulate a system of holding a meeting once a month to inspect the work of living welfare. At the same time, thirty-four Party members and eighty-five League members were sent to work in the public canteens. Secondly, ideological education for canteen staff was strengthened, and the staff team was rectified. Thirty-one people who were irresponsible and had serious illnesses were transferred out. Cook training classes were opened, experiences were exchanged, and model workers were commended. On this basis, competitions were launched between canteens. The third is to grow more vegetables, raise more pigs, and open up a wide range of vegetable sources. They stipulated that each person should have two to three fen of land to grow vegetables, and each canteen should establish its own vegetable base. The whole commune has planted 7,560 mu of various vegetables. Each canteen raised pigs, chickens, and ducks, and ran a tofu workshop. One hundred and twenty-six canteens ran sauce gardens. The fourth is to run the canteen democratically. A management committee was elected by the masses, and a meeting was held every half month to study the work of the canteen, listen to the opinions of the masses, and improve the work. The accounts should be cleared daily and settled monthly, and announced to the commune members regularly.

    Now, the work of the commune canteen has been greatly improved. Generally, three dishes and one soup are served for each meal, fish is eaten once every five days, meat can be eaten once every half month, and egg soup is eaten every day. When the commune members return from work every day, they eat hot meals, which taste delicious. They sing with satisfaction: "Three dishes and one soup for each meal, everyone praises the canteen, the commune members eat and laugh, and production is booming."

    下地生龙活虎  回来饭热菜香
    五里牌公社食堂深入检查推广先进经验
    本报讯  湖南省临湘县五里牌人民公社，最近组织力量，对全公社公共食堂的工作，进行一次大检查，从检查中总结推广先进经验，切实解决存在的问题，进一步巩固了公社，推动了生产。
    这次检查是在公社党委直接领导下进行的。公社党委首先召集了大队队长和党总支书记共二十一人，在巩固大队的毛湾食堂开了一次现场会，通过在这个食堂参观、访问，使大家认识到办好公共食堂，是直接关系到搞好生产、巩固公社的重要事情。毛湾食堂由于每人种了三分地的菜，自己喂了二十七头猪，一百三十一只鸡鸭，办了酱园、豆腐坊，还有人下河捕鱼，社员每餐吃到三菜一汤，半月吃一次肉（每人平均有五两），五天吃到一次鱼。这样一来，社员干起活来挺有劲，他们一百一十七个劳动力收割六百三十一亩晚稻，本来预计要六天才能收回，结果只用了三天半就收完了。看了这些事实以后，原来说食堂有米煮，有柴烧，还要什么领导的曾海祥也说：“过去公社说要加强领导，我总认为没有必要，这次一看才知道非加强领导不行。在这个基础上，接着研究了检查的内容是：社员吃的菜样数多不多，味道好不好？是否按照规定种植了足够的蔬菜？食堂工作人员负不负责任？态度好不好？身体是否健康？食堂工具是否齐全？清洁卫生做得如何？并且商定在检查中既要发现问题，解决问题，也要总结扩大先进经验。最后组织了二十四个人的检查队伍，兵分三路进行检查。
    检查组的同志深入到食堂、到工地、到社员家里，开座谈会，个别访问，征求社员们对公共食堂的意见。在那里发现了先进经验，就召集附近的食堂来开现场会，进行总结交流，在那里发现了问题，就同社员一块商量解决办法，一同动手解决。检查组到五里大队城乡食堂发现社员们无论什么时候回来都吃到热饭热菜，随时有热水洗澡、洗脚，有开水喝。原因是炊事员处处关心社员，他们准备了一个热水锅，经常烧有热水，还备有蒸笼，把菜放在蒸笼里，不管社员什么时候回来，都有热菜吃。检查组便召集附近五个食堂的工作人员在这里开了一个现场会，介绍了他们的经验，表扬炊事员的模范行为。各食堂回去以后，当晚就组织二十一个木匠做了蒸笼，还派人买回了烧热水的锅。从此，这五个食堂的社员也随时可以喝到开水了。检查组到棋盘食堂时，找了十八名社员开座谈会，征求他们对食堂的意见。社员们反映食堂工作人员不负责任又不讲卫生，有时饭煮不熟，上餐吃了的碗下餐还不洗，米不淘干净，菜也没有洗干净。社员们要求让工作负责、又会作饭的共青团员方云英来担任炊事工作。检查组和小队干部商量之后，当即同意了他们的意见，并同社员一道把碗柜、灶、锅、餐桌等工具洗得干干净净，清除了屋前屋后的垃圾和阳沟。
    公社党委针对检查出来的各种问题，一一妥善地作了解决。首先是进一步加强了领导，公社确定由书记挂帅抓生活福利工作，各大队总支书记都一手抓生产，一手抓生活，制订了每月主持开一次会检查生活福利工作的制度。同时派了三十四个党员和八十五个团员到公共食堂工作。其次是加强了对食堂工作人员的思想教育，整顿了工作人员队伍。把三十一个工作不负责任、有严重疾病的人员调出来。开办了炊事员训练班，互相交流经验，表扬了模范工作者，在这个基础上食堂与食堂之间开展了竞赛。第三是多种蔬菜，多喂生猪，广开菜源。他们规定每人有二分到三分地种菜，每个食堂都要建立自己的蔬菜基地，全社已种各种蔬菜七千五百六十亩。每个食堂都喂了猪、鸡、鸭，都办了豆腐坊，有一百二十六个食堂办了酱园。第四是民主办食堂。经群众选举出管理委员会，每半月开一次会，研究食堂工作，听取群众意见，改进工作。账目做到日清月结，定期向社员公布。
    现在，这个公社食堂的工作大大改进了，一般做到了每餐三菜一汤，五天吃到一次鱼，半月可以吃上一餐肉，天天吃上鸡蛋汤。社员们每天劳动回来，便吃到热喷喷的饭菜，味道可口，他们满意的唱道：“每餐三菜一个汤，个个都把食堂夸，社员吃得哈哈笑，生产搞得呱呱叫。”
