Shaanxi Promotes New Underground Irrigation Method
    Evenly Distributed Underground Water Pipes Result in Good Wheat Growth Above Ground

    (Our Dispatch) Various regions of Shaanxi Province are vigorously promoting the experience of "underground irrigation" in the wheat "satellite" fields cultivated this year to solve the irrigation problems of the wheat "satellite" fields.

    This experience was jointly researched by the Wei Hui Canal Experimental Station, the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Northwest Water Conservancy Science Research Institute. The Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department recently summarized this experience at a conference of relevant water conservancy leading cadres and water conservancy experts held in Wugong County.

    This experience is specifically to solve the irrigation problems of wheat satellite fields. Of the wheat fields sown in Shaanxi Province this year, 20% to 30% are satellite wheat fields. These wheat fields are generally deep-plowed, heavily fertilized, and densely planted, therefore, they require a large amount of water and require timely, appropriate and uniform irrigation. The old irrigation method (flood irrigation) in the past easily caused the soil surface to harden, affecting wheat growth, and also easily caused lodging, which is no longer suitable for the irrigation of wheat satellite fields. To this end, the Shaanxi Provincial Wei Hui Canal Experimental Station and the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute researched and experimented with this method in the Wugong area and achieved success. The advantages of the "underground irrigation" method are: it can save water, reduce evaporation, achieve long soil moisture retention time, facilitate mastering the irrigation quota, does not damage the soil structure, avoids soil erosion and wheat lodging; it can dissolve chemical fertilizers in water and directly supply them to the roots of crops for absorption, combining ground irrigation and fertilization; it can reduce the land occupied by fixed channels, ridges and water delivery ditches, and correspondingly reduce the breeding of weeds and pests, etc.

    There are two types of underground irrigation pipes: one is a blue tile pipe, and the other is a bamboo pole pipe. Before installation, the land should be leveled first, and then the underground pipes should be connected and installed in open ditches about forty to seventy centimeters deep and thirty centimeters wide (generally, the length of the pipe is thirty to fifty meters, and the pipe spacing is two to three meters). The bottom of the ditch should be compacted, and then a layer of crushed corn stalks or sorghum stalks should be laid to prevent soil subsidence from breaking the pipes. The slope of the bottom of the ditch should be one in a thousand. Blue tiles are used to form an arc-shaped pipe. The lower layers of the tiles are closely connected to each other, and the left and right sides of the tiles are compacted to prevent water leakage. A half-centimeter gap must be left between the tiles with the concave surface facing down to facilitate water outflow and soil saturation. A layer of wheat straw should also be laid on top of the blue tile pipes to prevent soil from falling into the pipes, and then the ditch should be filled and compacted to form an underground pipe. A pipe is connected to the water delivery canal at the water inlet, and the water flows into the underground irrigation pipe through the pipe. If bamboo poles are used as irrigation pipes, first drill through bamboo poles with a diameter of six to seven centimeters, and open water outlet holes of zero point six to zero point seven centimeters on the upper part of the bamboo poles every half centimeter using a triangular arrangement method. The installation method is roughly the same as that of blue tile pipes. In order to avoid siltation of the pipes, when irrigating with canal water with excessive sand content, a sedimentation pond can be built at the end of the field to allow the sediment to settle before flowing into the pipes. The pressure of the water in the pipes is used to make it slowly pass through the gaps in the tiles or the holes in the bamboo pipes, seeping into the soil, and then the capillary action of the soil is used to make the water spread around, gradually achieving uniform irrigation.

    This type of irrigation pipe has a low cost, can be made from local materials, is easy to promote, saves costs and has high efficiency, and has a long life. Each mu of land requires about three thousand tile pieces and can be used for several years. Therefore, it is very popular among the local people. At present, it has been widely promoted throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics, there are already more than 180 places that have begun to use this method to irrigate satellite wheat fields. In the experience of promoting underground irrigation, many methods have emerged successively, such as using specially fired tile jar pipes, triangular wooden board pipes, blue brick pipes, and the rat tunnel irrigation created in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area.

    陕西推广地下灌水新法
    地下水管布得匀  地上小麦长得好
    本报讯  陕西省各地正在今年培育的小麦卫星田中，大力推广“地下灌水”的经验，解决小麦“卫星”田的灌溉问题。
    这个经验是渭惠渠试验站、中国农业科学院陕西分院和西北水利科学研究所共同研究出来的。陕西省水利厅最近在武功县召开的有关水利领导干部和水利专家会议上，总结了这个经验。
    这个经验是专门解决小麦卫星田灌溉问题的。陕西省今年播种的麦田中有20％—30％是卫星麦田，这些麦田一般都进行了深翻、高肥和高度密植，因此，需水量大，并要求适时适量和均匀地进行灌溉。过去旧的灌溉方法（漫灌）容易发生地皮板结，影响小麦生长，也容易发生倒伏现象，已不适用于小麦卫星田的灌溉。为此，陕西省渭惠渠试验站和陕西省农业科学研究所在武功地区研究和试验了这个方法，并获得成功“地下灌溉”方法的好处是：可以节省水量、减少蒸发，做到保墒时间长，便于掌握灌水定额，不破坏土壤结构，避免对土地的冲刷和使小麦倒伏；可以将化学肥料溶于水中，直接供给作物根部吸收，使地面灌水和施肥结合起来；可以减少固定渠道畦埂和输水沟占地，相应减少杂草和虫害繁殖等。
    地下灌溉管道有两种：一种是青瓦管道，一种是用竹杆作的管道。安装前先要把土地平整好，然后接好安装地下管道约深四十到七十公分，宽三十公分左右的明沟（一般管道长度为三十到五十公尺，管道间距为二到三公尺），将沟底夯实，再铺一层碾破的玉米秆或高粱秆防止土壤沉陷折断管道，沟底坡度为千分之一，用青瓦铺成弧形管道，瓦与瓦的下层紧密相连，瓦与瓦的左右两侧捣实，以防漏水。凹面朝下的瓦与瓦之间必须留半公分的缝隙，以利出水浸润土壤。青瓦管道上面，还要铺一层麦草以免泥土掉入管内，然后把沟填平捣实，即成地下管道。在进水处接一根管通向输水渠，水就经过管流入地下灌溉管道。如果是以竹杆作灌水管，先将六到七公分直径的竹竿钻通，在竹管上部每隔半公分，用三角排列的方法开零点六到零点七公分的出水孔。其安装方法大致和青瓦管道一样。为了避免管道被泥沙淤积，在用含沙量过大的渠水灌溉时，可在地头修一沉沙池，使泥沙沉淀后，再流入管道，利用水在管道内的压力作用，使其缓缓通过瓦的缝隙或竹管的孔道，渗入土壤，再利用土壤的毛细管作用使水向四周漫润，逐渐达到灌水均匀。
    这种灌溉管道的造价低，可以就地取材，易于推广，费省效宏，寿命长。每亩地约需三千页瓦，可用数年之久。因此，很受当地群众欢迎。目前，已经在全省各地普遍推广，据不完全统计，仅已经开始用这种办法给卫星麦田进行浇水的即有一百八十多处。各地在推行地下灌溉的经验中，陆续出现有用专门烧成的瓦罐管道、三角木板管道、青砖管道、以及泾惠渠灌溉区创造的鼠道灌溉等许多方法。
