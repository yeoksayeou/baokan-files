Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Women are ingenious and skilled, their ambition for technology is higher than the sky, and they are keeping pace with men, making contributions to the people. This is the profound impression given by the speeches of women activists on the industrial front at today's National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference.

　　Conquered the Bastion of Cutting-Edge Science
　　"We must not only make great leaps forward together with male comrades, but also become vanguards and shock troops. What male comrades can do, we must also do, and what male comrades cannot do, we must also do." This is the bold language issued by Wang Jianfeng, the captain of the "Mu Guiying Assault Team" composed of twenty-nine female workers from the Shanghai Tongren Alloy Factory, at the meeting today. Their entire team of female workers trial-produced silicon-manganese bronze alloy wire and tin-zinc bronze alloy wire in their spare time. In the past, silicon-manganese bronze and tin-zinc bronze were all dependent on foreign imports. After the successful trial production, the country can save more than 20 million yuan in foreign exchange every year. Recently, they have successfully trial-produced seven kinds of advanced alloys. The twenty-nine female workers who carried out these creations did not have a high level of education or technology, and some of them had just shaken off the label of illiteracy; but difficulties did not scare them. They learned while doing, failed once and tried again, and finally conquered the bastion of cutting-edge science.

　　Increased Work Efficiency Several Hundred Times
　　How to shorten the downtime for handling faults and get the machines running earlier? Liu Xiaobian, a machine operator at the Xianyang No. 1 Cotton Factory in Shaanxi Province, has been studying this issue for some time. With the support of the Party and the help of comrades, she boldly carried out technical innovations and shortened the downtime for handling faults from the original fourteen seconds to nine point four seconds. In her speech today, Liu Xiaobian also introduced the specific operating methods she used to shorten the downtime. The speech of Li Renmei, a technician at the Guizhou Automobile Factory, more vividly showed that the Party's education enlightened her wisdom. Li Renmei is a laboratory technician at this factory. She improved her awareness during the rectification movement this year, concentrated on studying technology, and went deep into the workshop to participate in labor, and together with the workers, she successfully tested new operating methods and products such as "fast electroplating," "electrochemical polishing," and "quick-drying anti-sticking agent," increasing work efficiency by several hundred times or even more than a thousand times.

　　Housewives Create Indigenous Lathes
　　"Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." The Party's great call for the whole people to run industry has enabled housewives to do things they never thought possible. Zhao Yunying, a female worker at the Beiqu Machinery Repair Factory in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, talked about the story of how their ten housewives, who had been in the factory for less than two months, made an indigenous lathe. The equipment in their factory was very simple, and all production tasks had to be done manually, which was very inefficient. When Zhao Yunying usually delivered processed parts to the agricultural machinery factory, she saw that the "foreign" lathes in that factory were very fast and efficient, and she and several women were thinking day and night about trying to make a lathe as well. Their proposal was supported by the leadership. After seven days and seven nights of hard work, the ten women used wood as the body and scrap steel as parts, and spent only more than 100 yuan in cost. Finally, they made an indigenous lathe worth more than 800 yuan, which increased the efficiency by about five times compared with the original manual operation. Ding Wanying, the director of the Xinchun Street Chemical Factory in Changchun City, Jilin Province, introduced that the 133 female workers in their factory have all been transformed from housewives into skilled workers, and some have become workshop directors. The products they manufacture have increased to twelve kinds, and the quality of the insulating paper has exceeded the level of imported goods.

　　Technical Pioneers of Rural Lighting
　　Also speaking at the meeting were two representatives from Fuyang County, Anhui Province, who are technical pioneers in rural lighting. Huang Suying and other seven female workers from the Fuyang Lampshade Factory, after 354 experiments, used cotton yarn plus alum, water glass and other ingredients to make gasoline lamp mantles, replacing the expensive mantles made of asbestos; they have now successfully researched the application of this kind of lampshade to biogas lamps, which can increase the brightness of biogas lighting and ensure safety. Li Jiying, a teacher at the Youyi Elementary School in Chengji Township, and Principal Yao Xiechang jointly researched and developed a method of using natural biogas, which has been widely promoted throughout the county. This matter has also been filmed into a news documentary and spread throughout the country, and many newspapers and magazines have praised them.

　　At today's conference, the speech of a disabled female printing worker named Han Yun deeply moved everyone. In 1950, Han Yun had nine fingers severed by a book trimming machine. Over the years, she has continued to work and study with tenacious will and revolutionary optimism. She uses her only little finger on her right hand to practice dressing, eating, and writing. She said, I want to use these disabled hands to work for the beautiful socialist cause. At first, it took her more than an hour to put on a pair of socks, sweating profusely, and the words she wrote were bigger than walnuts; now she works in the binding workshop and has learned to use an abacus to calculate addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In 1956, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

　　Suzhou embroidery and Jiangxi porcelain are famous handicrafts in our country. Two representatives who spoke today are experts in this field. Li Eying from Suzhou City, who has loved embroidery since she was a child, once created a double-sided embroidery method for animals, using this method to embroider birds, tigers, cats, and horses, which are exactly the same on both sides. Wang Guiying, who works at the Jingdezhen Ceramic Research Institute, has made achievements in researching, revising, and creating the patterns and shapes of porcelain, and she has also written a book of more than 40,000 words introducing her experience in ceramic powder painting.

　　A total of fourteen people spoke at today's conference. Among them are Luo Shuzhen, a mail carrier at the Beijing Post Office who has delivered 1.1 million pieces of mail without errors; Yuan Xiurong, a member of the 505 Prospecting Team of the Tarim Mining Bureau of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, who has carried out geological surveys in the 400,000 square kilometers of the Taklimakan Desert; and Wang Qiurong, a sixteen-year-old girl from Shengsi County, Zhejiang Province, who learned the skills of fishing at sea and became a boat boss.

　　At today's meeting in the morning, Liu Qian, director of the General Office of the Industrial Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave a report on industrial issues. In his report, he introduced the current situation of the mass movement on the industrial front with steel as the key link, and encouraged women activists to continue to lead the broad masses of women and make greater contributions in the great movement of the whole people running industry.

　　The conference will continue on the 14th. (Attached picture)

    妇女们心灵手巧  钻技术志大才高
    妇女积极分子在发明创造方面大显身手
    新华社13日讯  妇女们心灵手巧，钻技术志比天高，和男子并驾齐驱，为人民立下功劳。这是活跃在工业战线上的妇女积极分子，今天在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议上的发言所给予人们的深刻印象。
    攻破了尖端科学堡垒
    “我们不但要和男同志一起大跃进，而且要成为尖兵和突击手。男同志能做的我们也要做，男同志还不会做的我们也要做。”这是上海市铜仁合金厂由二十九个女工组成的“穆桂英突击队”队长王建枫今天在会上发出的豪迈的语言。她们全队女工在业余时间内试制成硅锰青铜合金丝和锡锌青铜合金丝。硅锰青铜和锡锌青铜过去都是依靠国外进口的，现在试制成功后，每年可以给国家节省二千万元以上的外汇。最近她们又试制成功七种高级合金。进行这些创造的二十九个女工，文化、技术水平都不很高，其中有些人还刚摘掉文盲帽子；但是困难并没有吓倒她们，她们边学边干，一次失败再来一次，最后终于攻破了尖端科学堡垒。
    提高工效几百倍
    怎样缩短处理停台时间使机器早开车，陕西省咸阳市国棉一厂值车工刘小变多少时候来一直在钻研这个问题。在党的支持和同志们的帮助下，她大胆进行了技术革新，把处理停台时间由原来的十四秒缩短到九点四秒。刘小变今天在发言中还向大家介绍了她缩短处理停台时间的具体操作方法。贵州省汽车制造厂技术员黎仁美的发言更生动地显示了党的教育启发了她的智慧。黎仁美是这个厂的化验技术员，她在今年整风运动中提高了觉悟，安心钻研技术，并且深入车间参加劳动，和工人们一起试验成功了“快速电镀”、“电化学打光”、“快干防粘剂”等新的操作方法和产品，提高工效几百倍甚至一千多倍。
    家庭妇女创造土车床
    “世间无难事，只怕有心人”。党的全民办工业的伟大号召使家庭妇女们做出了她们从来想也没有想过的事。湖南省湘潭市北区机械修配厂女工赵云英谈起她们十名进厂不到两个月的家庭妇女制成一部土车床的故事。她们那个工厂设备非常简陋，所有的生产任务都要用手工操作，工效很低，赵云英平时给农业机械厂送加工的零件时，看到那个厂里用“洋”车床车零件很快，干起活来很起劲，她就和几个妇女在一起日夜思考着也要试制一部车床。她们这个倡议得到领导上的支持。十名妇女经过七天七夜的苦干，以木料作车身，废钢铁作部件，只花了一百多元的成本，最后制成了一台价值八百多元的土车床，比原来手工操作的工效提高了五倍左右。吉林省长春市新春街化工厂厂长丁万英向大家介绍说，她们那个工厂里一百三十三名女工，都由家庭妇女变成了熟练工人，有的当了车间主任。她们制造的产品已增加到十二种，其中绝缘纸的质量已经超过了进口货的水平。
    农村照明事业的技术先锋
    在会上发言的还有来自安徽省阜阳县的两位代表，她们是农村照明事业中的技术先锋。阜阳纱罩厂女工黄素英等七个人，经过三百五十四次试验，用棉纱加上明矾、水玻璃等配料制成汽油灯的纱罩，代替了用石棉制成的价格高昂的纱罩；她们现在又研究成功把这种纱罩运用到沼气灯上去，可以提高沼气照明的光度，并且可以保证安全。这个县的程集乡友谊小学的教师李继英和校长姚燮昌共同研究成采取天然沼气的办法，在全县普遍推广，这件事还被摄成新闻纪录片传布到全国，许多报刊杂志都表扬了她们。
    在今天的大会上，一位名叫韩运的双手残废的印刷女工的发言，深深感动了大家。韩运在1950年被裁书机轧断了九个手指。这些年来，她以顽强坚毅的意志和革命乐观主义精神继续工作和学习，她用仅有的右手一个小拇指练习穿衣、吃饭、写字。她说，我要用这残废的双手为美好的社会主义事业而劳动。开始时，她穿双袜子就要用一个多钟头，累得满头大汗，写出来的字比核桃还大；现在她在装订车间作发书工作，已学会用算盘来计算加、减、乘法。1956年她光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    苏州刺绣和江西瓷器是我国著名的手工艺品，今天发言的有两位代表就是这方面的能手。自小就爱好刺绣的苏州市的李娥英，曾经创造了动物双面绣法，用这种办法绣的鸟、虎、猫、马，正反两面完全一样。在景德镇陶瓷研究所工作的汪桂英，曾经在研究修改和创造瓷器的画面与器型的工作中做出了成绩，她并且写了一本四万多字的介绍陶瓷粉绘经验的书。
    今天在大会上发言的共十四人。她们之中还有投递邮件一百一十万件无差错的北京邮局投递员罗淑珍，曾经在四十万平方公里的塔克拉玛汗大沙漠进行地质普查的新疆石油管理局塔里木矿务局五○五普查队队员袁秀容，学会下海捕鱼的技术并且当上了船老大的浙江省嵊泗县十六岁的姑娘王秋戎。
    在今天上午的大会上，中共中央工业工作部办公厅主任刘谦作了关于工业问题的报告。他在报告中介绍了目前工业战线上以钢为纲大搞群众运动的情况，并且鼓励妇女积极分子们今后继续带动广大妇女，在全民办工业的伟大运动中作出更大的贡献。
    14日，大会将继续进行。（附图片）
