Combining Year-Round Specialization and Temporary Crash Campaigns
Nanping County's Diversified Economy Production Triples in One Year

(Our Dispatch) The people's communes in Nanping County, Fujian Province, have adopted a method of combining the organization of year-round specialization with temporary crash campaigns, enabling diversified economic production to achieve comprehensive leap-forward development, just like steel and grain production.

Nanping County is very rich in forest, sideline, and local specialty resources, and the income from diversified economy accounts for about half of the county's national economic income. Under the circumstances of this year's great leap forward in grain and steel production, the county's labor force is very tight, making it very difficult to develop diversified economic production. The Nanping County Committee of the Communist Party of China first strengthened the leadership of diversified economic production from the county to the commune and the production team. A county party secretary and a deputy county head took charge, responsible for studying, arranging, and commanding the county's diversified economic production. Secondly, they unified the arrangement of various production labor forces, drawing out more than 20,000 people (accounting for about 20% of the county's full and semi-labor force) to establish 2,239 specialized production organizations (teams) such as forest and sideline product processing plants, logging yards, forest farms, livestock farms, economic crop farms, and forestry chemical plants, responsible for diversified economic production, ensuring the development of diversified economic production organizationally. Thirdly, they implemented large-scale cooperation between industry, agriculture, and diversified economy, cross-linking and mutual support. During the busy seasons of rice transplanting and steelmaking, some labor forces were drawn from the specialized teams to support grain and steel production; during the intervals between grain and steel production, temporary crash campaigns were organized to improve diversified economic production. This year, after rice transplanting and before the summer and autumn harvests, a total of three high-yield battles for diversified economic production were organized, with participation reaching about 40% of the total labor force. Therefore, the county's timber, bamboo, dried bamboo shoots, rapeseed, live pigs, and other diversified economic and sideline productions have all increased by one to three times compared with last year. The county's more than 150,000 farmers, with the income from diversified economic production alone, averaged 279 yuan per person, ensuring that all communes in the county, in addition to implementing free meals, can also pay wages to commune members on a monthly or ten-day basis, making the lives of the vast number of commune members increasingly prosperous.

    常年专业和临时突击相结合
    南平县多种经济生产一年增加三倍
    本报讯  福建省南平县各人民公社，采用组织常年专业和临时突击相结合的办法，使多种经济生产能和钢铁、粮食生产一样，全面获得飞跃发展。
    南平县林木、副业和土特产品资源十分丰富，多种经济收入占全县国民经济收入一半左右。在今年粮食、钢铁生产大跃进的情况下，全县劳力十分紧张，要发展多种经济生产有很大困难。中共南平县委首先从县到公社和各生产队都加强了多种经济生产的领导，一位县委书记和副县长挂帅，负责研究、安排和指挥全县多种经济生产。其次，统一安排各种生产劳力，抽出两万多人（占全县全、半劳力20％左右），分别成立了二千二百三十九个林副特产加工场、采伐场、林场、畜牧场、经济作物场、林业化工厂等专业生产组织（队），负责多种经济生产，从组织上保证多种经济生产的发展。第三，实行工、农业和多种经济大协作，互相串套、互相支援等办法。在插秧、炼铁大忙时，从专业队抽出部分劳力支援粮食和炼铁生产；在粮食、炼铁生产间隙时间，组织临时突击，搞好多种经济生产。今年在插秧后，夏收和秋收前，共组织了三次多种经济生产的高产战役，参加人数达到总劳力的40％左右。因此，全县木材、毛竹、笋干、油菜、生猪等多种经济和副业生产都比去年增加一倍到三倍以上。全县十五万多个农民，仅多种经济生产的收入一项，每人平均则达二百七十九元，保证了全县各公社除了实行吃饭不要钱外，还能按月按旬发给社员工资，使广大社员的生活都日渐富裕起来。
