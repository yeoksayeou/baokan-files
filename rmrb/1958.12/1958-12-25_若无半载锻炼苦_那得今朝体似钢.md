    If one does not endure half a year of arduous training,
    How can one obtain a steel-like body today?

    Those who consistently engage in physical exercise and possess strong bodies are capable of undertaking arduous tasks and completing them effectively. Gao Xiuying, a student from the Class of '56 at the Beijing Mining Institute, who is currently working at the Majiagou Mine in Kailuan, exemplifies this. Since starting her life as a miner in September, she has worked as a material transporter, pulling wooden pillars weighing dozens of pounds to supply her masters for support; she has held a power drill weighing over ten pounds to continuously drill fourteen shot holes; and she has also wielded an iron shovel, swinging it left and right to load freshly mined coal onto mine cars. She has been able to complete each task excellently. The workers have written big-character posters praising her several times, and recently she was also rated as a fifth-grade worker. How is she able to work so well? Because she possesses a high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility, as well as a strong and healthy body.
    In February and March of this year, Gao Xiuying rarely participated in physical exercise due to her stout build, and her body was not strong enough. When the Great Leap Forward in sports began, she understood the great significance of exercising and resolutely and persistently threw herself into physical training. Others ridiculed her, but she did not waver. Her strength, endurance, and speed steadily increased. After several months of practice and many tests, she finally improved her 100-meter dash time, which was most difficult for her, from over 19 seconds to over 16 seconds, reaching the first-grade standard of the Labor and Defense System. Gao Xiuying's continuous and vigorous training laid the physical foundation for her to successfully complete her work tasks in the future. (Zhang Qingquan)

### 若无半载锻炼苦  那得今朝体似钢

    若无半载锻炼苦
    那得今朝体似钢
    坚持经常锻练、身体强壮的人，就可能担负繁重的工作和很好地完成任务。现在开滦马家沟矿劳动的北京矿业学院经56年级学生高秀英就是这样。从今年9月开始了矿工生活，三个多月里她作过运料工，拉着几十斤重的木柱供给师傅支架用，抱着十多斤重的电钻连续打过十四个炮眼，也曾手持铁铲左挥右舞把刚采下的煤炭装上矿车。每样工作她都能出色地完成。工人们曾几次写大字报表扬她，最近她还被评为五级工。她怎会劳动得这样好呢？因为她有着高度的积极性和责任心，同时也有着结实健壮的身体。
    今年2、3月的时候，高秀英还因为体胖很少参加体育锻炼，身体不够健壮。当体育大跃进开始后，她懂得了锻练身体的重大意义，就顽强地、坚持不懈地投身到体育锻练中来。别人讥讽过她，但她毫不动摇。力量、耐力、速度在不断增加，经过几个月的练习，经过很多次测验，最后终于把对她来说最困难的一百公尺，由十九秒多提高到十六秒多，达到劳卫制一级标准。高秀英不间断地顽强锻练，为她后日能胜利完成工作任务打下身体基础。  （张庆权）
