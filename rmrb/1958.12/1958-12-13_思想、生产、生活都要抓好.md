(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 12th dispatch) In order to rapidly launch a large-scale mass movement to rectify and consolidate people's communes throughout the province, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee has passed relevant instructions and decided to organize inspection and evaluation teams composed of cadres from the provincial, regional, county, and commune levels. Approximately 15,000 cadres will participate in the inspection, led by Zhang Zhongliang, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. Starting from December 11th, a major inspection of the ideology, production, and life of the people's communes will be conducted. The inspection and evaluation team departed on December 11th.

This major inspection work will take socialist and communist ideological education as the guiding principle, specifically focusing on the following five aspects: First, make every effort to improve the production and construction of the people's communes. While rectifying, consolidating, and improving the people's communes, we should conscientiously implement the policy of commune industrialization, agricultural factoryization, simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and simultaneous development of self-sufficient economy and commodity production. Implement the agricultural production direction of planting less and harvesting more, vigorously carry out tool improvements, further develop industrial and agricultural production, and create a solid material foundation for the consolidation and development of the people's communes. Second, according to the principle of the people's commune being a five-in-one entity of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and combining government administration with commune management, fully mobilize the masses to discuss and formulate comprehensive development production plans for the commune's current and long-term future. Third, correctly handle the distribution issue, and conscientiously clear accounts during the commune rectification, ascertain the actual situation, adhere to the principle of democratic commune management and running the commune with diligence and thrift, and oppose extravagance and waste. Fourth, all communes are required to earnestly run various livelihood and welfare undertakings while improving production. Correctly resolve the relationship between labor and leisure, hard work and rest, and production and learning, and make reasonable and comprehensive arrangements for the commune members' labor, learning, rest, recreation, medical care, etc. Fifth, improve and strengthen the operation and management of the commune. While implementing organizational militarization, action combatization, and collective living, it is necessary to emphasize management democratization and the mass orientation of cadres' work style, and truly establish the viewpoint of relying on the masses.

The Provincial Party Committee particularly emphasized that in the major inspection, it is necessary to follow the mass line, advocate a style of hard work, plain living, seeking truth from facts, and consulting with the masses on everything. Special attention should be paid to protecting the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and party members, adopting the method of criticism and self-criticism, summarizing work, and examining ideology to help cadres improve their understanding, correct shortcomings and mistakes, and strengthen their confidence in continuing to move forward.

(Our newspaper, Changsha, 12th dispatch) The Hunan Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference on the evening of the 9th, attended by the first secretaries of the prefectural, county, and municipal party committees, the secretaries of the people's commune party committees, and responsible comrades from the provincial party committee, the provincial people's committee, and departments. The Provincial Party Committee issued a "Decision on Launching a Major Inspection of Production and Livelihood, Consolidating People's Communes, and Rapidly Launching a High Tide of Agricultural Production." From December 10th to January 10th of next year, 10,000 cadres will be drawn from the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, with leaders at all levels personally taking command and going deep into each people's commune to carry out a major inspection of production and livelihood.

On the 10th, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee had already drawn 1,000 cadres from provincial-level organizations and formed 60 inspection teams, which were directly sent to 60 counties to work in one or two people's communes. Cadres drawn from local and county party committees have also successively gone deep into the people's communes. The main content of this inspection includes: current agricultural production; production plans (agriculture and industry); the masses' livelihood; this year's income distribution; the operation and management of the people's communes; the working style of the mass line; and socialist and communist ideological education, etc.

The Provincial Party Committee particularly emphasized that the main task of this major inspection is: with enthusiasm and responsibility, to earnestly help the people's communes summarize their experiences in all aspects of work, discover red flags, plant red flags widely, and coordinate with local leading organs to organize on-site visits and evaluations in a timely manner, using key points to promote the overall work. For problems and shortcomings existing in the work, it is also necessary to actively help solve them locally. In the major inspection, special attention should also be paid to promoting the fine working style of cadres following the mass line, opposing and correcting the erroneous work style of coercion and commandism; advocating meticulous care for the masses' livelihood; advocating the spirit of combining ideological liberation, daring to think and act with a scientific and honest attitude, and opposing exaggeration and falsehood. It also requires the cadres of the inspection team to set an example, work hard and go deep, listen carefully to the voices of the masses, understand the masses' thoughts, demands, and opinions, integrate with local cadres and the masses, and live, eat, and work together with them.
