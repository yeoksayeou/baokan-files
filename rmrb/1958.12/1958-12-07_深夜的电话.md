	The Late-Night Phone Call
	At two o'clock in the morning, Liu Jingren, a telephone operator at the Lianyuan Bureau, tidied up the record slips on her switchboard, yawned, and was about to take off her headphones to go to sleep when a number plate buzzed.
	"The county magistrate's office isn't resting at this hour!" she thought, and deftly connected the line. Sure enough, it was County Magistrate Zhang's voice: "Hello, switchboard, please connect me to the bus station chief."
	County Magistrate Zhang's voice was urgent. Clearly, something important was happening. She tensed up and quickly flicked the switch. But no one answered the phone at the bus station. Her crank was getting hot, so she switched to the ringer, cranking and cranking, but all she heard in her headphones was silence. County Magistrate Zhang finally said, "Please keep ringing, and tell him to come to the county committee immediately for an emergency steel production meeting." Liu Jingren looked at the clock. She had been ringing for half an hour. She pondered County Magistrate Zhang's instructions, remembering the Party branch secretary's speech at the all-out support steel production meeting and the pledge of their "Liu Hulan Class." She thought: I must find a way to notify the bus station chief and complete the communication task! She put down her headset, asked the long-distance station to keep an eye on it, opened the front door, and headed towards the bus station.
	It was very dark, with only stars vaguely blinking in the clouds, and the streets were silent. Liu Jingren took a breath and stopped. She was a timid girl who usually needed a female companion to go to the dormitory. Now she was alone, without any light, and the bus station was still two li away, next to a grove of trees... But when she thought of the urgent steel meeting waiting to start, and that her communication task was not yet completed, she bit her lip, summoned her courage, and ran to the bus station in one breath.
	She knocked on the door for a while, and two people appeared in front of her at the same time. By the light of their flashlights, she recognized one of them as County Magistrate Zhang.
	"Who is it? It's too early to buy a ticket!" the county magistrate asked.
	It turned out that County Magistrate Zhang was afraid that the phone call would be delayed, so he personally ran to the bus station to find the station chief. When he learned that Liu Jingren was the operator who had come to summon him, he was very moved. He shook her hand tightly and thanked her repeatedly, saying, "The comrades at the post office are so good; you have set a new style." Liu Jingren said shyly, "This is what I should do."

    深夜的电话
    深夜两点钟，涟源局话务员刘静仁整理好机桌上的纪录单，打了个哈欠，正准备放下耳机去睡觉，一只号牌吱吱地叫了起来。
    “县长室这时候还没休息！”她想着，敏捷地接了线。果然，这是张县长的声音：“喂，总机，请要汽车站站长接电话。”
    张县长声音很急促，显然，一定有什么紧急的事情。她精神紧张起来，迅速地掀动了电键。可是，汽车站没有人接电话。她的摇柄发热了，又换上振铃器，摇了又振，振了又摇，耳机里始终是一片寂静。张县长最后说：“请你再摇摇吧，通知他马上到县委开紧急钢铁生产会议。”刘静仁看了下钟，已经摇了半个小时了，她怔怔地思索着张县长的指示，记起了党支部书记在全力支援钢铁生产会议上的讲话和她们“刘胡兰班”的保证，她想：一定要想法通知汽车站长，完成通讯任务！她搁下耳机，请长途台给照看一下，打开大门，向车站走去。
    天很黑，只有星星隐约地在云团里眨着眼睛，街道上寂静无声。刘静仁透了口气，站住了脚。她是个胆小的姑娘，平时到宿舍去还要拉个女伴，现在就一个人，又没有光亮，汽车站还远在二里路外一座树林旁边，……但她想起紧急的钢铁会议正在等待开始，自己的通讯任务还没有完成，便咬紧嘴唇，壮起胆子，一口气奔向汽车站。
    她打了一阵门，有两个人同时出现在她的跟前。凭着他们的手电光，她认出其中一人就是张县长。
    “是谁？买车票还太早哩！”县长问道。
    原来，张县长怕电话接不通耽误事情，亲自跑到汽车站找站长来了。当他知道刘静仁就是专为他来喊人的话务员之后，非常感动，紧紧地握着她的手，连声道谢说：“邮电局的同志真好，你们树立了新风格”。刘静仁不好意思地说：“这是我应该作的事情。”
