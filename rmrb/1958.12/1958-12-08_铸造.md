Casting

    Casting has a wide range of applications in industry. Taking metal machine tools for processing as an example, castings account for about 85% of the weight. 60% of tractors and locomotives are castings.

    Sand casting can be said to be the oldest casting method. Yu casting the Nine Tripod Cauldrons in ancient China is an example of ancient casting. This method is very simple: a kind of viscous sand is made into a hollow sand mold shape, which is required to be exactly the same as the metal part to be cast, and there must be a hole of appropriate size. Then, molten iron is poured into the sand mold from the hole. After the metal solidifies, the sand mold is broken, and the casting is formed.

    The method of making sand molds is to first use wood to make a wooden mold with the same shape as the casting, put it into a sand box that can be separated up and down, fill the sand box with molding sand, compact the sand, then separate the upper and lower halves of the sand, take the wooden mold out of the box, and then put the sand box together to form a hollow sand mold. If you want to cast parts with holes in the middle, you must also place a core in the sand mold that is equivalent to the size of the hole.

    In large factories, the same type of castings are usually produced in large quantities, and metal models are mostly used. This metal model is made up of several parts. A sand mold can only be used once, while a metal model can be used tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of times.

    The sand casting method results in rough part surfaces that are not precise enough. If "precision casting" is used, the surface of the cast parts is smooth, and the size difference is no greater than one-tenth of a millimeter.

    Most of the foundry workers in our country use manual operations. In the past six months, under the call of the Party, workers in various places have marched towards technological revolution, created indigenous machinery, saved manpower and investment, and greatly improved production efficiency.

    铸造
    铸造在工业上的应用范围很广，拿加工的金属机床来说，铸件重量约占85％左右，拖拉机与机车有60％是铸件。
    砂型浇铸法，可以说是最古老的铸造方法。我国历史上的禹铸九鼎，就是古老铸造的一例。这种方法十分简单：一种带有粘性的砂，作成中间空心的砂型形状，要求它与需要铸造的金属零件一模一样，并要有一个大小适当的孔，然后把铁水从孔口浇入砂型，待金属冷凝后，打破砂型，就成铸件。
    砂型的制法，先用木料制成和铸件形状相同的木模，把它放入一个可上下分开的砂箱中，用型砂填满砂箱，将砂打结实，然后将上下两半连砂分开，把木模从箱中取出，再将砂箱合一，即成为空心的砂型。如果要铸造中间有孔的零件，则在砂型中还要安置一个和孔大小相当的型心。
    大型工厂中，通常生产同型的铸件较多，大都采用金属作成模型。这种金属模型用几个部分拼合而成。一个砂型只能用一次，一个金属模型则可用几万次，多至几十万次。
    砂型铸造方法，零件表面粗糙，不够精密，若用“精密铸造法”，铸出的零件表面光洁，尺寸相差不大于十分之一公厘。
    我国铸工大都采用手工操作，近半年来各地职工，在党的号召下，向技术革命进军，创造了土机械，节省了人力、投资，生产效率也大大提高。
