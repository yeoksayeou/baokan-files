Heilongjiang Built an Important Mechanical and Electrical Industrial Base
Large Quantities of Power Generation and Smelting Equipment are Continuously Shipped to Various Regions

    (Our report) Harbin, previously known as "Great Northern Wilderness," after the key construction of the First Five-Year Plan, Heilongjiang Province has developed into an important mechanical and electrical industrial manufacturing base. At present, the province's 200,000-strong mechanical industrial force, under the call to fully tap potential and vigorously support the whole country, is stepping up efforts to rush production of more, larger, and newer products to support national construction.
    The Harbin Electric Motor Factory, Boiler Factory, and Steam Turbine Factory, responsible for supplying the whole country with hydro and thermal power generation equipment, are three newly built modern large factories. The Harbin Electric Motor Factory, the first to be built, has already produced dozens of sets of hydropower equipment, arming the newly built hydropower stations across the country, and has supported the construction of iron and steel, coal, machinery and other industrial sectors with tens of thousands of large and medium-sized electric motors. The Harbin Boiler Factory, which was completed in July last year, has so far produced 34 power station boilers, equipping newly built power stations in 11 provinces, including Yunnan, Fujian, and Sichuan. In September this year, the two factories, together with the newly built Harbin Steam Turbine Factory, began to produce complete sets of thermal power equipment. To date, two sets of 25,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment have been successfully manufactured, and 200,000 kilowatts of thermal power equipment will be manufactured by the end of the year.
    In order to vigorously support the construction of the power industry, these three factories conscientiously implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" enterprise "constitution" under the leadership of the Party committee, vigorously launched mass movements and technological revolutions, and fully exploited equipment potential, resulting in production growth multiplying. The workers of the steam drum and forging workshops of the Harbin Boiler Factory reformed the outdated rules and regulations that hindered production development, and the tasks completed in October were equivalent to two and a half times those in September, and the production capacity was increased by six times compared with the original design. The workers of the foundry workshop of the Harbin Electric Motor Factory broke through the old process regulations, and the output of castings increased month by month. In November, more than 1,600 tons were completed, exceeding the output in August by more than one time. The Harbin Steam Turbine Factory tried every means to tap production potential. The production hours of the second 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine they manufactured were reduced by half compared with the first one.
    The Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory, Electric Carbon Factory, and Insulation Material Factory, which are equipped with modern equipment, are also giving full play to the potential of the new factories and producing various new products. Since the Great Leap Forward in production this year, the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory has produced 400,000 various instruments, arming various sectors of the national economy. The Harbin Electric Carbon Factory has been in production for only five months, and it has overfulfilled the supply of 110 tons of electric carbon products to all parts of the country. In the first ten months of this year, the Harbin Insulation Material Factory successfully trial-produced 57 new products, six of which have reached a very high technical level.
    Dozens of machinery manufacturing factories distributed in Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places have also undertaken the manufacture of a large number of complete sets of blast furnaces, rolling mills, electric furnaces, converters, mining machinery, and nitrogen fertilizer equipment for the whole country this year. The Harbin Heavy Machinery Factory, Songjiang Tractor Manufacturing Factory, and other factories are now in the final assembly of 12 255-cubic-meter blast furnaces and 4 100-cubic-meter blast furnaces, which will soon be completed and sent to Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, and other places. Small factories with simple equipment such as Harbin Qunli, Heli, and Agricultural Machinery have also undertaken the manufacture of 11 sets of 250 mm to 400 mm rolling mills, and are currently carrying out assembly work in full swing. The first and second lathe factories in Qiqihar have undertaken the manufacture of thousands of machine tools for the whole country this year. Jixi Mining Machinery Factory has also manufactured a large number of mining equipment such as coal mining combines this year, making a great contribution to mechanized coal mining.

    黑龙江建成一个重要的机电工业基地
    大宗发电冶炼设备源源运往各地
    本报讯  一向被称为“北大荒”的黑龙江省，经过第一个五年计划的重点建设，已发展成为一个重要的机电工业制造基地。目前，全省二十万机械工业大军，在充分挖掘潜力，大力支援全国的号召下，正加紧赶制更多、更大、更新的产品，支援全国建设。
    肩负供应全国水力、火力发电设备的哈尔滨电机厂、锅炉厂、汽轮机厂，是国家新建的三个现代化的大工厂。最先建成的哈尔滨电机厂，已经制成数十套水力发电设备，武装了全国各地新建的水电站，并以上万台的大中型电动机，支援了钢铁、煤炭、机械等工业部门的建设。去年7月建成的哈尔滨锅炉厂，到现在已生产出三十四台电站锅炉，装备了云南、福建、四川等十一个省新建的发电站。今年9月，两个工厂又与新近建成的哈尔滨汽轮机厂，开始配套生产整套的火力发电设备。到目前为止，已经有两套二万五千瓩火力发电设备制造成功，到年末还将制造二十万瓩的火力发电设备。
    为了大力支援电力工业建设，这三个工厂认真贯彻执行在党委领导下的“两参一改三结合”的企业“宪法”，大搞群众运动和技术革命，充分发挥设备潜力，生产成倍地增长。哈尔滨锅炉厂汽包、锻工两个车间的职工，改革了妨碍生产发展的陈规旧制，10月份完成的任务相等于9月份的两倍半，生产能力比原设计提高了六倍。哈尔滨电机厂铸工车间的职工，冲破旧的工艺规程，铸件产量月月上升，11月份完成了一千六百多吨，超过8月份产量一倍以上。哈尔滨汽轮机厂千方百计地挖掘生产潜力，他们制造的第二台二万五千瓩汽轮机，生产工时比第一台减少了一半。
    拥有现代化装备的哈尔滨电表仪器厂，电碳厂，绝缘材料厂，也正在充分地发挥着新厂的潜力，生产各种新产品。哈尔滨电表仪器厂从今年生产大跃进以来，已经生产出四十万只各种仪表，武装了国民经济各个部门。哈尔滨电碳厂开工生产只有五个月，就超额完成了一百一十吨电碳制品供应全国各地。哈尔滨绝缘材料厂在今年头十个月中，试制成功了五十七种新产品，其中六项已具有很高的技术水平。
    分布在哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等地的数十个机械制造工厂，今年也为全国承制了大量的成套的高炉、轧钢机、电炉、转炉、矿山机械和氮肥设备。哈尔滨重型机器厂、松江拖拉机制造厂等现正在最后组装十二台二百五十五立方公尺高炉和四台一百立方公尺高炉，不日即将全部完成，送往广东、广西、浙江、云南、四川等地。哈尔滨群力、合力、农业机械等设备简陋的小工厂，也承制了十一套二百五十公厘到四百公厘的轧钢机，目前正在紧张进行组装工作。齐齐哈尔第一、第二两个车床厂，今年为全国承制了上千台的机床。鸡西矿山机械厂，今年也制造了大批的采煤康拜因等矿山设备，为机械化采煤作出了巨大的贡献。
