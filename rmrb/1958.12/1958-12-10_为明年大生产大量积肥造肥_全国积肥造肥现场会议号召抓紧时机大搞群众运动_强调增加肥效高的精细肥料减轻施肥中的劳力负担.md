Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th. The National On-site Promotion Conference on Fertilizer Accumulation and Production, held in YuHang County, Zhejiang Province, requires all regions and people's communes across the country to immediately begin accumulating natural fertilizers on a large scale, vigorously develop indigenous chemical fertilizers, and plant green manure crops on a large scale, to comprehensively launch a large-scale mass movement of fertilizer accumulation and production, and prepare sufficient fertilizer for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

This conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Chemical Industry to launch the fertilizer accumulation and production movement this winter and next spring. It lasted nine days, from November 24th to December 2nd. Representatives from the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Land Reclamation, and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences participated. Representatives from agricultural and chemical departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as representatives from some fertilizer factories and scientific organizations of people's communes, also attended the meeting. The conference was held in YuHang County to visit the situation of large-scale indigenous chemical fertilizer production in rural YuHang County and to promote the experience of universal fertilizer production in YuHang County.

The meeting believed that the large-scale application of fertilizer is one of the major guarantees for the unprecedented bumper harvest of various crops this year. Next year, the production of grain, cotton, and oil must be further leaped forward, and the demand for fertilizer will be even greater; and more efficient refined fertilizers are needed to reduce the labor burden in large-scale fertilization. Therefore, this winter, we must take various effective measures to further and widely carry out the fertilizer accumulation and production movement. Due to the large number of fertilizers needed, the accumulation of organic natural fertilizers cannot be ignored. We must organize all labor forces that can be invested in fertilizer accumulation to act, and combine the regular fertilizer accumulation of some labor forces with large-scale concentrated fertilizer accumulation. In addition, we must vigorously develop indigenous chemical fertilizers and plant green manure on a large scale. The meeting requested all regions to study the instructions on fertilizer issues issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 29, and implement the policy of focusing on organic fertilizer, while developing chemical inorganic fertilizer as much as possible. On the one hand, we must do everything possible to accumulate and produce farmyard manure in large quantities and improve its quality, and at the same time further increase the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers. The meeting called on all regions to further open up fertilizer sources, let household fertilizer go out, mineral fertilizer come out of the soil, mountain fertilizer go down the mountain, sea fertilizer land, and water fertilizer go ashore, and develop and utilize all fertilizer sources; it also required all regions to plant more green manure and raise more pigs, and also combine planting green manure with raising pigs, and use green manure as feed to raise pigs to increase the accumulation of pig manure. The meeting believed that the experience of ShouZhang County, Shandong Province, in planting fodder crops and developing pig raising to solve fertilizer problems this year is worth promoting. The meeting also called on all regions, towns, and factories to support rural areas with fertilizer, waste water, waste materials, and waste gas.

Through visits in YuHang, the meeting also focused on discussing the issue of indigenous chemical fertilizers; it required all regions to widely manufacture them based on the principles of local material selection, local production, and local use. The meeting believed that the following methods can be universally promoted: recovering ammonia in all flues, using various industrial wastes to produce nitrogen fertilizer, using indigenous methods to produce calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer in small blast furnaces, and using seaweed to produce potash fertilizer. The meeting requested all regions to greatly increase the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers according to resource conditions, both increasing output and improving quality, and creating new varieties. The places and communes that have already produced indigenous chemical fertilizers should take measures such as assigning people, equipment, quality, and quantity to consolidate them; places that have not developed or have developed poorly should develop them universally. The meeting called on all regions to find mineral sources, use possible equipment, and establish small indigenous chemical production groups, first establishing small sulfuric acid groups and small soda ash groups. In the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers, attention must also be paid to the comprehensive utilization of resources and the development of indigenous pesticides.

In addition to accumulating fertilizer, planting fertilizer, and producing fertilizer, the meeting also studied fertilizer preservation, transportation, and application, and required all regions to closely combine the six links of accumulation, planting, production, preservation, transportation, and application, and required that all of them be done well, especially paying attention to increasing the proportion of refined fertilizer, and paying attention to maintaining fertilizer content (mainly nitrogen). The meeting emphasized that all regions must, under the unified leadership of the Party, cooperate closely and comprehensively do a good job in the fertilizer work related to a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    为明年大生产大量积肥造肥
    全国积肥造肥现场会议号召抓紧时机大搞群众运动
    强调增加肥效高的精细肥料减轻施肥中的劳力负担
    据新华社杭州9日电  在浙江省余杭县举行的全国积肥造肥工作现场促进会议，要求全国各地各人民公社，从现在起立即开始大积自然肥料、大搞土制化肥和大种绿肥作物，全面开展大规模的群众性的积肥和造肥运动，为明年农业生产更大跃进准备好充足的肥料。
    这次会议是农业部和化学工业部为发动今冬明春的积肥、造肥运动联合召开的，从11月24日到12月2日开了九天。国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、商业部、农垦部、中国农业科学院都有代表参加。参加会议的还有：各省、市、自治区的农业、化工等部门的代表，和一些化肥工厂和人民公社的科学组织的代表。会议在余杭县召开，是为了参观余杭县农村大搞土制化肥的情况和推广余杭县普遍造肥的经验。
    会议认为：大量增施肥料是今年各种农作物获得史无前例的大丰收的重大保证之一。明年粮棉油生产都要进一步跃进，肥料的需要量更加大了；而且需要肥效更高的精细肥料，来减轻大量施肥中的劳力负担。因此，今冬就必须采取各种有效措施，进一步广泛开展积肥、造肥运动。由于需肥数量很大，大积有机的自然肥料仍不能忽视，必须组织一切可以投入积肥的劳力行动起来，并且把部分劳力的经常积肥和大规模的突击积肥结合起来。此外还要大搞土制化肥和大种绿肥。会议要求各地学习中共中央8月29日发布的关于肥料问题的指示，贯彻执行以有机肥料为主，同时尽可能地发展化学无机肥料。一方面千方百计地大量积制农家肥料并且提高它的质量，同时进一步增加土化肥的生产。会议要求各地进一步开辟肥源，让家肥出门，矿肥出土，山肥下山，海肥登陆，水肥上岸，把一切肥源开发利用起来；要求各地多种绿肥多养猪，还可把种绿肥和养猪结合起来，用绿肥作饲料养猪来增积猪粪。会议认为山东省寿张县今年大种饲料作物发展养猪来解决肥料的经验值得推广。会议还号召各地城镇工厂用肥料和废水、废料、废气等支援农村。
    这次会议还通过在余杭的参观、访问，着重地讨论了土制化肥的问题；要求各地根据就地取材、就地生产、就地使用的原则广泛制造。会议认为：在一切烟道中收回氨，利用各种工业的废物造氮肥，在小高炉中用土法造钙镁磷肥，和海藻造钾肥等几种，是可以普遍推广的。会议要求各地就资源条件大大增加土化肥的生产，既要增加产量又要提高质量，创造新的品种。已造土化肥的地方和公社，要采取定人、定设备、定质、定量等办法巩固下来；还没有发展和发展较差的地方要普遍发展。会议号召各地寻找矿源，利用可能的设备，建立化工生产小土群，首先建立小硫酸群和小纯碱群。在生产土化肥中，还须注意对资源的综合利用，和发展土制农药。
    除积肥、种肥、造肥外，会议还对保肥、运肥、施肥也作了研究，要求各地把积、种、造、保、运、施六个环节密切结合起来，而且要求都作好，特别是要注意增加细肥比重，注意保持肥分（主要是氮素）。会议强调：各地必须在党的统一领导下，密切配合，全面作好关系于明年农业生产更大跃进的肥料工作。（附图片）
