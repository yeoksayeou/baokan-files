"Our Public Canteens Are Really Well-Run"
By Our Correspondent Sun Dexian

　　One morning in late November, braving the cold wind, I visited a public canteen at the foot of Longhu Mountain in Jianyang County, Fujian Province – the public canteen of the Xianfeng Brigade of the Jukou Red Flag People's Commune. This canteen was formed by merging the original thirteen small canteens (run by the Jukou Advanced Agricultural Cooperative). It has four canteens for agriculture, the elderly, children, and the sick, located in the center of the village where residents are concentrated and transportation is convenient. More than two thousand people in the brigade eat there, but they are well-organized, and the commune members are all satisfied.

　　Canteen Spacious and Clean

　　Around nine o'clock in the morning, Commune Chief Huang Wenbin accompanied me to visit the public canteen. As I stepped into the canteen, I saw clean tables in the spacious dining hall, each with a bamboo cover. The inside and outside of the dining hall were spotless. The cooks, dressed in neat work clothes, were either scalding bowls and chopsticks with boiling water or wiping pot lids. The Commune Chief told me that since the brigade started the public canteen, due to the good cleaning and sanitation work, the number of patients has been greatly reduced compared to before the canteen was established, and the brigade's attendance rate has also increased unprecedentedly, with an average monthly attendance rate of 97%.

　　The Commune Chief led me to a sunny kitchen, where the cooks were busy cooking by the stove. The Commune Chief told me that in addition to cooking different meals for the elderly, the sick, and pregnant women, the public canteen also regularly organizes mobile canteens to cook meals for commune members in the fields and forests.

　　Setting Up Stoves in High Mountain Forests

　　More than two hundred commune members in the forestry team often go deep into the mountains to cut trees and plant forests. The public canteen sends cooks to carry rice and vegetables to the forest area to cook for the commune members. Wherever the forestry team goes, the mobile canteen moves there. Sometimes the commune members cut trees on high mountains more than a thousand meters high, and the cooks of the mobile canteen build stoves and chop firewood in the forests on the high mountains to cook for the commune members. When it rains, they set up sheds in the forest area and cook under the big trees. Logging requires more effort than farming, so the mobile canteen steams fragrant rice. As soon as the commune members get off work, the cooks bring hot dishes and rice to the commune members. After the meal, they also send a pot of hot boiled water to the commune members. But it wasn't like this in the past. Because the village was far from the forest area, it was inconvenient for the commune members to go home for meals. They used to bring food to the mountains to work in the morning, and eat cold dishes and rice on the mountains at noon, so many commune members developed stomach problems. Since the public canteen organized mobile canteens, the commune members can eat hot meals and dishes when they go to the mountains to work.

　　Taking Care of the Elderly and the Sick

　　Not only that, but the public canteen also takes good care of the elderly. The canteen staff delivers the meals to the "Happiness Home" on time. They worry that the food will get cold from the wind, so they wrap the rice pots warmly with straw and old cotton. The elderly like to eat soft food, so the canteen always uses high-quality rice and nutritious vegetables that are suitable for the elderly, such as tofu, bok choy hearts, and sliced meat, to cook for the elderly. Some elderly people have difficulty walking due to old age and poor eyesight, so the staff always serve them at the table when the elderly are eating, adding rice and soup for them. The elderly people are grateful and say: If it weren't for the Communist Party, we wouldn't have such a good life today.

　　The public canteen takes even more meticulous care of the sick. One day, Huang Meiyun, an old woman in her sixties, suddenly fell ill. When the canteen staff found out, they cooked porridge, sweet potatoes, and noodles for Huang Meiyun to eat. Huang Meiyun was so moved by this that she shed tears, and holding the hands of the staff, she said: You are even closer than relatives!

　　Good Food and Delicious Dishes

　　In October, more than ten thousand iron-smelting peasants from the neighboring areas of Masha and Chaoyang came to participate in iron smelting at the Jukou Iron and Steel Base. Due to the surge in the town's population, vegetable supplies became difficult, but the public canteen still changed its dishes every day. When the supply of green vegetables was low, the chefs came up with more than twenty kinds of delicious dishes for the commune members using taro, sweet potatoes, etc., so the commune members all praised and said: Our canteen is really well-run.

　　In order to allow the commune members to eat better, in addition to regularly convening meetings of commune member representatives to solicit opinions on the management of the canteen and to develop menus, the public canteen management committee also used barren mountains to plant more than seventy mu of green vegetables, and newly opened a livestock farm, raising more than one hundred and seventy pigs. At the same time, they also decided to raise 1,500 chickens, 2,000 ducks, and eighty rabbits this year, and all fourteen fish ponds will also be stocked with fish. Because the public canteen grows its own vegetables and raises pigs, each commune member can now eat an average of one and a half jin of green vegetables per day, and one jin of pork per month (in the past, each person only had four liang per month).

　　The Canteen Is Also a Club

　　Every time it's mealtime, the public canteen plays operas or songs, which the canteen staff specially broadcast for the commune members returning from the fields. According to the canteen manager, they often arrange various exciting programs for the commune members. For example, they often invite the kindergarten dance troupe and singing troupe to perform dances and songs for the parents returning from work.

　　The canteen also prepares various recreational equipment. Whenever the commune members rest after meals, they gather in groups of three or five to play cards or chess. The commune members told me with a smile: This is our canteen, and also our club.

    “我们的公共食堂办得真好”
    本报记者  孙德籼
    11月下旬的一天早晨，我冒着寒风访问了福建省建阳县龙湖山下的一个公共食堂——莒口红旗人民公社先锋大队的公共食堂。这个食堂是由原来十三个小食堂（莒口高级农业社办的）合并成的，它设有农业、老人、少年儿童、病人等四个食堂，分布在居民集中、交通方便的村中心，全队二千多人就分散在那里吃饭。虽然公共食堂用饭的人多，但他们却办得井井有条，社员们个个都感到满意。
    食堂宽敞清洁
    上午九点多钟，公社社长黄文斌陪我到公共食堂参观。当我踏进这个食堂的时候，就见到宽敞的饭厅里，放着一张张干净的桌子，每张桌上都放有一只竹做的罩子；饭厅的里里外外都打扫得很干净。穿着整洁工作服的炊事员们，有的正在用滚水烫洗碗筷，有的在擦锅盖。社长告诉我，自从队里办起公共食堂以后，由于做好了清洁卫生工作，病人已比办食堂前大大减少，全队出勤率也空前提高，平均每月社员出勤率达到97％。
    社长领我到一个阳光充足的大厨房，炊事员们正在灶边忙着做菜。社长告诉我，公共食堂除了给老年人、病人、产妇等烹饪各种不同的饭菜外，还经常组织流动食堂，到田间、林区里给社员们做饭做菜。
    在高山森林立灶
    林业队的二百多个社员，经常深入大山中伐木、造林。公共食堂就派出炊事员，背米挑菜，到林区里给社员们煮饭。林业队到哪里，流动食堂就搬到哪里。有时社员们在一千多公尺高的大山上伐木，流动食堂的炊事员们就在高山上的森林里，筑灶、砍柴给社员们做饭；遇到天下雨，他们就在林区里搭起草棚，在大树下做饭。伐木比干农活花力多，流动食堂就蒸出香喷喷的大米饭，只要社员一下工，炊事员们就把热菜热饭端到社员手里，饭后还给社员们送来了一壶热腾腾的开水。可是过去并不是这样，因为村子离林区较远，社员们回家吃饭不便，都是早上带饭上山干活，中午就在山上吃些冷菜冷饭，因此有不少社员生起胃病。自从公共食堂组织流动食堂以后，社员们上山干活都能吃到热饭热菜了。
    照顾老人、病人
    不仅如此，公共食堂对老人们也照顾得很好，每餐饭菜都由食堂服务员按时送到幸福院里。他们担心饭菜被风吹冷，每次都是用稻草、旧棉花把饭锅包得暖暖的。老年人喜欢吃软的饭菜，食堂总是拿适合老年人吃的上白米和富有营养的菜，像豆腐、青菜心、肉片等，给老人们做饭做菜。有些老人因年老行走不便、眼睛不好，服务员们在老年人吃饭时，总是侍候在桌旁，给老人们添饭添汤。老人们都感谢地说：要不是共产党，我们那有今天这样好的日子过。
    公共食堂对病人照顾得更是无微不至。一天，六十多岁的老大娘黄眉云突然病了，食堂服务员知道后，就给黄老大娘煮稀饭、甜番薯和挂面给她吃。黄老大娘为这件事感动得掉下泪来，握着服务员们的手说：你们真比亲人还亲呀！
    饭好菜可口
    10月间，邻区麻沙、茶?等地来了一万多个炼铁农民，参加莒口钢铁基地炼铁后，由于镇上人口激增，蔬菜供应发生了困难，但是公共食堂的菜，还是每天换新的。青菜供应量少，厨师们就想出用芋头、番薯等，给社员们做了二十多种可口的菜，因此社员们都称赞地说：我们的食堂办得真好。
    为了让社员们吃得更好，公共食堂管理委员会除定期召开社员代表会，征求对食堂管理工作的意见和制订菜单外，食堂还利用荒山种了七十多亩青菜，新辟了一个畜牧场，养了一百七十多头猪。同时他们还决定在今年内养鸡一千五百只，鸭子二千只，兔八十只，十四口鱼塘也将都养上鱼。由于公共食堂自己种菜、养猪，现在每个社员平均每天已能吃到一斤半的青菜，每月还可吃到一斤猪肉（过去每人每月只有四两）。
    食堂也是俱乐部
    每到吃饭的时候，公共食堂里就传出了一阵唱戏或唱歌的声音，这是食堂服务员们专门为下田归来的社员们播送的。据食堂管理员告诉我，他们经常给社员安排了各种精彩的节目。例如，他们经常邀请幼儿园的舞蹈队、歌唱队，来这里为劳动归来的父母们表演舞蹈和唱歌。
    食堂还准备了各种文娱用具，每当饭后休息的时候，社员们就三五聚在一起玩扑克或下象棋。社员们笑着告诉我：这里是我们的食堂，也是我们的俱乐部。
