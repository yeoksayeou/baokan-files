Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: The Soviet government reiterated today that the U.S. government bears full responsibility for the consequences arising from the dangerous flights of U.S. aircraft near the Soviet border and the violation of Soviet airspace.

Today, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the U.S. Embassy, a response to the U.S. Embassy's note of November 13th. In this note, the Soviet government lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government regarding the unprovoked firing by a U.S. military aircraft at a Soviet fighter plane in the vicinity of Ventspils (Latvia) in Soviet territory.

The Soviet note pointed out that, according to detailed investigations, U.S. Air Force aircraft were discovered making clearly hostile flights in the Baltic coastal region and the Far East region of Soviet territory on November 7th and 8th.

Among these, one U.S. aircraft directly approached the Soviet border and groundlessly opened fire on a Soviet fighter plane.

The Soviet note stated that, in order to eliminate one of the sources of tension in Soviet-U.S. relations and to eliminate the possibility of senseless and deadly conflicts, as the Soviet government has already stated, the U.S. government must take measures to permanently prohibit its air force from sending aircraft to fly towards the Soviet border and violate the border line.

    美机侵入苏领空无端攻击苏联飞机
    苏联向美国提出抗议
    新华社16日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联政府再次声明，美国政府要对美国飞机靠近苏联边境作危险飞行所引起的后果和侵犯苏联领空负全部责任。
    今天苏联外交部交给美国大使馆一份照会，这个照会是对美国大使馆11月13日照会的答复。在这个照会中，苏联政府对美国军用飞机在苏联领土温次匹尔斯（拉脱维亚）的附近地区的上空无端地向苏联歼击机开火一事，向美国政府表示坚决抗议。
    苏联照会中指出，根据详细调查确定，11月7日和8日发现有美国空军飞机在苏联领土波罗的海沿岸和远东地区作显然怀有敌意的飞行。
    其中有一架美国飞机直接靠近了苏联国境，并无端地向苏联歼击机开火。
    苏联照会中说，为了消除苏美之间关系尖锐化的根源之一，并消除毫无意义地损失人命的危险冲突事件的可能性，正像苏联政府已经说明的，美国政府必须采取措施，这就是永远禁止自己的空军派飞机飞往苏联国境和破坏国境线。
