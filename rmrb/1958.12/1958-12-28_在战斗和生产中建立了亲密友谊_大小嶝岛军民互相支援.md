In the heroic outpost islands of Greater and Lesser Deng (福建省大、小嶝岛), 1,598 households have, over the past year, actively supported the front lines while simultaneously persisting in production. They have overcome attacks from Chiang Kai-shek's troops and disasters such as continuous rain, drought, and typhoons, ensuring unprecedented bumper harvests in grain, salt, fisheries, and shipping.

The Greater and Lesser Deng Islands are only five or six li away from Jinmen Island, which is occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and are frequently subjected to attacks by Chiang's aircraft and artillery. To ensure their happy lives and the socialist construction of the motherland, the islanders have further mobilized, implementing a system of universal conscription. All residents between the ages of sixteen and fifty have joined the militia and various support-the-front organizations. They actively cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in severely punishing the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen, and adopt a method of combining labor and military affairs, such as engaging in large-scale support-the-front activities during lulls in the fighting and focusing on production when the fighting is less intense, to maintain normal production. Throughout the year, in addition to actively assisting the People's Liberation Army in transporting stone, wood, artillery shells, and participating in the construction of fortifications and combat, they also used the intervals between fighting to deepen all the ponds on the island by more than double, implement universal dense planting, and promptly replant a large number of crops destroyed by Chiang's artillery shells. As a result, they achieved a double harvest in production and support for the front.

In supporting the front and persisting in production, many model individuals with communist spirit, who disregarded their own safety and did not care about labor remuneration, emerged on the islands. In the three or four months since our army began shelling Jinmen on August 23, 358 activists and 11 advanced units have been awarded the title of People's Hero and received commendations for their meritorious service. Zhang Shuihong, a second-class meritorious person, together with other militiamen, has repeatedly thwarted the interception of Chiang Kai-shek's warships and artillery fire over the years, successfully completing the task of reconnaissance and distributing leaflets in the waters near Jinmen. After August 23, he and the village militia organized a stretcher team, living and eating with the officers and soldiers of the artillery unit. When there were wounded, they rescued them; when there were no wounded, they served as ammunition carriers, transporting artillery shells. After the battle, they participated in repairing fortifications or persisted in production near the front lines. Once, an ammunition depot was hit and exploded by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery shells. The soldiers who came to the rescue were killed or wounded by shrapnel, but Zhang Shuihong remained unafraid. He directed the stretcher team to rescue the wounded and fearlessly entered and exited the ammunition depot amidst the flying shrapnel, rescuing 39 boxes of artillery shells by himself. The members of the Lianxing Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative, which won the title of Collective Meritorious Unit, enthusiastically launched a rapid transportation competition in support of the front and persisting in production. They shuttled back and forth on the sea, which was tightly blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery fire, not only ensuring that the troops had everything they needed, wherever they needed it, and voluntarily transported a large number of supplies to support the front, but also increased their income by more than 10,000 yuan in persisting in maritime production and transportation. They were praised as the "Iron Transportation Team."

The people of Greater and Lesser Deng Islands have also received strong support from the People's Liberation Army stationed on the islands in persisting in front-line production and construction. According to incomplete statistics, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the islands have contributed more than 18,000 workdays in their busy combat and training, helping the islanders accumulate more than 130,000 dan of fertilizer and building many water conservancy projects. In daily life and combat, there have also been many touching stories of military doctors and soldiers who, regardless of fatigue and danger, worked day and night to treat the residents and rescue their lives and property. When the soldiers of the fifth squad of a certain artillery unit stationed on Greater Deng Island heard that the entrances and exits of a bomb shelter where 88 residents were hiding had been completely blocked by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery shells, they immediately dispatched the entire squad, braving the intense artillery fire to rush to the rescue, rescuing all the residents to a safe area and giving up their own bomb shelters and bunks for the residents to live in.

Now, the army and civilians on the islands have forged a close friendship in combat and production. Under the unified arrangement of the commune's Party committee, the army and civilians cooperate with each other, dividing responsibilities for supporting the front, production, combat, and defending the coast. The army and civilians on the islands have also formulated a production plan for next year, which requires that the output value of all production items be more than doubled compared to this year.

    在战斗和生产中建立了亲密友谊  
    大小嶝岛军民互相支援
    本报讯  英雄的前哨岛屿——福建省大、小嶝岛上的一千五百九十八户居民，一年来一面积极支援前线，一面坚持生产，战胜了蒋军炮火的袭击以及连绵阴雨、干旱、台风等灾害，保证了在粮食、盐业、渔业和航运等方面，获得了空前的大丰收。
    大、小嶝岛和蒋军盘踞的金门岛相距仅五、六华里，经常遭受蒋军飞机、大炮的袭击，为了保证自己的幸福生活和祖国的社会主义建设，岛上居民都进一步动员起来，实行了全民皆兵，所有十六岁到五十岁的居民全部参加了民兵和各种支前组织，一面积极配合人民解放军严惩金门蒋军，一面采用大打搞支前，小打搞生产等劳武结合办法，照常坚持生产。一年中，他们除了积极协助人民解放军运送石料、木头、炮弹和参加修筑工事、战斗等以外，还利用间隙，把岛上所有池塘加深一倍以上，普遍实行密植，及时补种了大批被蒋军炮弹打毁了的农作物，因而获得了生产、支前两丰收。
    在支前、坚持生产中，岛上出现了许多奋不顾身、不计劳动报酬的具有共产主义风格的模范人物，从8月23日我军开始炮击金门以来的三、四个月中，先后就有三百五十八个积极分子和十一个先进单位荣获人民功臣的称号和受到记功表扬。二等功臣张水虹，几年来曾同其他民兵一起，屡次粉碎蒋军军舰和炮火的拦击，胜利完成到金门附近海面侦察情况和散发传单的任务。8月23日以后，他又和村里民兵组织一支担架队，同炮兵部队官兵同吃同住，有伤员即抢救伤员，没有伤员时即担任弹药手，搬运炮弹，战斗结束后，又参加抢修工事或在阵地附近坚持生产。一次有个弹药库被蒋军炮弹打中爆炸了，赶来抢救的战士们有的被弹片打死打伤了，张水虹仍然毫不畏惧地一面指挥担架队员抢救伤员，一面奋不顾身地出入在弹片纷飞的弹药库中，一个人先后抢出了三十九箱炮弹。荣获集体功臣单位称号的联星木帆船运输合作社的社员在支前和坚持生产中，热烈开展快速运输竞赛运动，在蒋军严密的炮火封锁的海面上穿梭往来，不但做到了部队要什么有什么、要到哪里就到哪里，义务运送了大批支前物资，同时，在坚持海上生产运输中还增加了一万多元的收入，被赞誉为“钢铁运输队”。
    大、小嶝岛人民在坚持火线生产建设中，也得到驻守岛上人民解放军的大力支援。据不完全统计，仅是驻守岛上的人民解放军某部官兵在紧张的战斗和练兵中，就先后出工一万八千多工日，帮助岛上居民积肥十三万多担，还兴修了很多水利工程。在日常生活和战斗中，还出现了许多军医和官兵不顾疲劳和冒着危险，日夜为居民治病和抢救居民生命财产的感人事迹。驻守在大嶝岛上的炮兵部队某连五班战士，在听到驻地附近八十八个居民隐蔽的一座防炮洞的出入口全被蒋军的炮弹打塌堵死时，立即全班出动，冒着密集的炮火赶往抢救，把全部居民抢救到安全地带，并让出自己的防炮洞和床铺给居民居住。
    现在，岛上全体军民已在战斗、生产中结成了亲密友谊，在公社党委会统一安排下，军民相互配合，分工负责支前、生产、战斗和保卫海防等工作。岛上军民还订出了明年的生产规划，规划中要求各项生产产值要比今年增加一倍以上。
