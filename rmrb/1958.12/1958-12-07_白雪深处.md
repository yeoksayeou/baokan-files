Deep in the White Snow
By our reporter Chen Yongjin

The white clouds are floating.

When people look up at the white clouds floating in the long sky, they certainly wouldn't think that there are people working hard deep in the white clouds. If they did, they would probably understand it through mythology. In Yunnan, this phenomenon is not uncommon.

This day, we took a car from Kunming and drove north, climbing countless mountains and passing through countless clouds. At four o'clock in the afternoon, we found ourselves above a vast sea of clouds. Here, factory machines are turning, cars are honking and speeding, and the copper smelting furnaces are burning fiercely. Here, one can still hear the sounds of gongs and drums and the joyful songs of the copper smelting workers. Not only on the plains, but also in the clouds, one can hear the footsteps of the motherland advancing.

The morning after arriving in this mountainous area, Party Secretary Jing Kezhou led us to see the copper smelting. He led us off the road and onto a difficult path. After climbing for about half an hour, we reached the earthen furnaces surrounded by thick smoke. Jing Kezhou looked at the workers busily smelting copper and said, "Our growth process started from here. These are the small indigenous furnaces, the small 'foreign' furnaces are halfway up the mountain, and the large 'foreign' furnaces are on the big mountain over there."

At this moment, the sound of bellows pumping, "whoosh, whoosh," came from the small indigenous furnace group. Some of these small indigenous furnaces are made of mud, and many are made of furnace slag. This is the workers' creation; if they were built with bricks and stones, not only would they not be able to fire the bricks, but the cost would be very high. Such a small indigenous furnace can produce more than one hundred kilograms a day if the ore is good. The one we are looking at now is a good indigenous furnace. Two old workers are happily talking about something, sometimes touching the heavy copper ingots, knocking on them, and listening to the sound of the metal. Jing Kezhou said: "They insisted on coming even when we told them not to work." In fact, the reason why these people are so happy is precisely because they are contributing their strength to society.

The loud noise of a powerful blower drew us to the roadside halfway up the mountain. This is the base for the small "foreign" furnaces. The so-called small "foreign" furnace is an indigenous furnace with a blower. How to produce so much copper in such a short time? Without a blower, the normal production of the furnace cannot be guaranteed, so they adopted the method of arming themselves by producing their own blowers. When the workers in the repair shop heard that more copper was to be produced, they worked on the design during the day and made machines at night, increasing production from one unit per week to three units per day, not only faster but also of good quality.

We stopped next to a sixty-ton furnace. The old furnace foreman, about fifty years old, was directing production, and for a moment he ignored the visiting outsiders. He nervously ran to the top of the furnace, more than two meters high, which was spewing flames, looked at the ore inside the furnace, then opened the tuyere to check the temperature of the fire, and then walked over to us with peace of mind and waved his hand, saying, "Now our furnace is producing normally, and it can produce two tons of copper a day." Old furnace foreman Huang Chaoxiang smiled with satisfaction. He said, "Our sixty-ton furnace has fifty workers, but only two of them have ever smelted copper." When this large furnace was first started, adding 700 catties of ore was normal, but later they always wanted high yields and added 900 catties at once. The next morning, the furnace broke down. After that, he would tell the workers how to operate the furnace before work every day, and he would personally teach the new workers during the operation. Old Huang constantly said: "The country needs copper, we must study hard, and ask questions if we don't understand." In order to get these new workers to quickly master copper smelting techniques, Old Huang never stopped running from the furnace to the bottom and from the bottom to the furnace.

Those days, although Old Huang was so nervous, he was truly happy in his heart. Because he is an old worker, and for many years, he never dreamed that so many people would be smelting copper, and he never felt that society needed him as much as it does today. For him, not seeing copper produced is as uncomfortable as being hungry. He has been involved in copper smelting capital construction work since 1952. At that time, he heard many cadres say that a very large factory would be built here in the future, and the factory would be very modern. Not only would the factory be modernized, but the railway would also be connected here. A month passed, a year passed, and several years passed, and they were still carrying out capital construction, digging mine tunnels every day. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, in a short period of time, they rose from small indigenous groups to small "foreign" groups, and the speed of capital construction - large "foreign" groups - was also faster than in the past. They also smelted so much copper for the country and trained so many people, which would be of great use for large-scale production in the future!

From a long, long distance away, we saw the iron frame erected on the higher mountain peak on the other side of the mountain. The red flag was fluttering on the iron frame. Sometimes it was shrouded in thick white clouds, and when the white clouds flew away, its majestic body proudly pierced into the air. This is the shaft project of the "large foreign group" construction site. Who can not be excited by that shaft project? But when such a large project started, there were only some earthen baskets and some mattocks. Should we start construction or not? A technician named Zhou Penglin said:

"Such a large shaft project, how can it be carried out without a winding machine, and how can it be carried out without an air compressor and a drilling machine? To start construction like this, isn't it a joke?"

"Machines are made by people, and miracles are also made by people," the workers said.

"You can do it, but I'm not responsible if there is an accident."

"If you're not responsible, we are responsible. Capital construction must also leap forward, and we can't wait any longer."

The workers here relied on their own hands and those simple tools to get started. As a result, they completed eleven meters a day. Later, when the winding machine and the air compressor arrived, they only completed twelve meters. In the mine tunnel under the shaft, although the slope was steep and there was a lot of water, and there was no light railway, the workers created the national daily progress record. And this advanced record also appeared because advanced thinking defeated backward thinking. When they started digging the mine tunnel, the monthly plan was only fifty meters. The workers raised objections:

"It's the Great Leap Forward! It's outrageous to only set a plan of fifty meters per month. It should be at least one hundred meters."

"The book stipulates that the maximum monthly progress can only reach seventy meters," said technician Yang Zuorong.

"Are there any large enterprises like ours in the book? The book is written by people. We only know how to strive for advancement, go all out, and build with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. What is written in the book is not all correct," the workers questioned Yang Zuorong.

"Our country has never had a monthly tunnel digging progress of one hundred meters."

Later, the workers discussed the results at a meeting, and the target was not set at one hundred meters, but at one hundred and seventy meters. Yang Zuorong said again:

"I am not opposed to greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but there must be a scientific basis. You see, one row of cannons can only advance one meter, and three cannons a day can only advance three meters. At most, it can advance ninety meters a month. Is it possible for you to set a plan of one hundred and seventy meters?"

"Okay, we'll do it, you watch!" The workers replied to Yang Zuorong.

The employees here were determined to make a double leap forward in production and capital construction. At that time, as soon as the sound of cannons in the tunnel stopped, the workers transporting stones went in pushing their carts, braving the thick smoke. At this time, the leaders usually used orders to ask the workers to rest and eat. Their monthly progress was not one hundred and seventy meters, but two hundred and thirty meters. In the face of such vivid facts, Yang Zuorong said:

"My thinking is backward. I only believe in books and don't see the greatness of the working class's strength. In the future, I will learn from the worker comrades."

The song of the rising step by step of industrial construction here is being played deep in the white clouds. (Attached image)

    白雪深处
    本报记者  陈勇进
    白云在飘动着。
    当人们仰望那长空里飘动着的白云的时候，他一定不会想到在白云深处还有人在紧张地劳动。如果有的话，人们也爱从神话上来理解它。在云南，这种现象是不少见的。
    这天，我们从昆明坐车一直往北走，也不知爬过多少高山，也不知穿过多少云块，到下午四点钟的时候，就置身于茫茫的云海之上了。在这里，工厂的机器在转动着，汽车在鸣叫奔驰，炼铜的炉火在熊熊的燃烧。在这里，还不时听到锣鼓的喧闹声和炼铜工人快乐的歌声。不仅在大平原上，在云端同样可以听到祖国前进的脚步声。
    到这个山区的第二天上午，党委书记荆克洲同志就领我们看炼铜。他领我们离开了马路往一条难行的小道上爬。大约爬了半个钟头的时间，就到达那片浓烟冲天的土炉旁。荆克洲看着紧张炼铜的工人说：“我们的成长过程就是从这里开始的。这是小土群，山半腰是小洋群，那边的大山上是大洋群。”
    此刻，从那边的小土炉群里，传出了呼?呼?的拉风箱的声音。这些小土炉，有的是用泥土造成的，有不少是用炉碴造成的。这是工人们的创造，如果用砖用石垒，不仅砖烧不出来，它的造价会高得很。这样的小土炉，如果矿石好一天能出一百多公斤。眼前我们看的就是个好的土炉。两个老工人正在乐滋滋地谈些什么，有时用手摸摸那沉重的铜块，敲敲，听听那金属的声音。荆克洲说：这些人不叫他们劳动，他们硬是跑来了。其实这些人所以那样高兴，正是因为他为社会上贡献了自己的力量。
    强烈的鼓风机的响声把我们引到半山腰马路边上来。这里的炼炉，是小洋炉的阵地。所谓小洋炉就是土炉加鼓风机。这么短的时间，要生产这么多的铜，用什么办法呢？没有鼓风机就不能保证炉子的正常生产，他们采取自己武装自己的办法生产鼓风机。当修机厂的工人们听说要生产更多铜的时候，他们白天造型，晚上造机器，从过去一个星期生产一台，提高到一天生产三台，不仅这样快，而且质量好。
    我们在一个六十吨炉旁停下来。那个约五十岁的老炉长正在指挥生产，一时他并没有理睬外来的参观者，只是紧张地跑到两丈多高的喷着烈焰的炉顶上，看了看炉内的矿石，然后又打开风嘴，看了看炉火的温度，才放心地走近来向我们招手说：“现在我们这个炉生产正常了，一天能出两吨铜。”老炉长黄朝相满意地笑了笑。他说：“我们这个六十吨的炉子有五十个工人，而炼过铜的却只有两个。”这个大炉子刚开炉时，矿石加到七百斤炉子很正常，后来他们老想高产，一下加到九百斤，第二天早晨，炉子坏了，以后，他每天上班前就对工人讲怎样操作，操作的时候他亲手教新工人。老黄嘴里整天价念道着：国家需要铜，我们要加紧学习，不懂就问。老黄为了叫这些新工人快着掌握炼铜技术，总是不停脚地从炉上跑到炉下，又从炉下跑到炉上。
    那些天，老黄虽然那样紧张，但他心中真像开花般的高兴。因为他是一个老工人，多少年来，他做梦也没想到有这么多人炼铜，他从来没觉得社会上像今天这样地需要他。对于他来说，看不到出铜真像挨饿一样难受。从1952年他就参加了炼铜的基本建设工作。那时，他听不少干部讲，将来这里要建立多么大的工厂，工厂又是怎样地现代化，不仅工厂现代化，铁路还要通到这里来。一个月过去了，一年过去了，几年过去了，他们还在进行基本建设，天天打矿洞。自从党中央提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义后，在短短的时间里，他们由小土群，上升到小洋群，基本建设——大洋群的速度也比过去更快了。他们还为国家炼出那么多的铜，炼出那么多的人来，这对未来的大规模生产该有多么大的用处啊！
    老远老远就看见山那边更高的山峰上树立的铁架，铁架上红旗飘扬，它有时被浓厚的白云笼罩着，当白云飞走的时候，它那雄伟的身躯骄傲地插入空中，这就是“大洋群”建设工地的竖井工程。谁能不为那竖井工程而振奋呢？可是当这么大的工程开始的时候，这里仅有一些土簸箕，仅有一些洋镐，开工不开工呢？一个叫周鹏林的技术员说：
    “这么大的竖井工程，没有卷扬机怎么进行，没有压风机、没有钻眼机又怎么进行，要这样开工，不是开玩笑吗？”
    “机器是人造的，奇迹也是人造的。”工人们说。
    “你们干吧，出了事故我不负责。”
    “你不负责我们负责，基本建设也要跃进，我们不能再等下去。”
    这里的工人们，凭着自己的双手，凭着那些土家什干起来了。结果他们一天干到十一公尺，后来卷扬机来了，压风机来了，也才干到十二公尺。在竖井下的矿洞里，虽然坡度大，出水多，没有轻便铁道，工人们却创造了全国的日进纪录。而这种先进纪录也是因为先进思想战胜落后思想才出现的。开始打矿洞时，每月计划只有五十公尺，工人们提出了反对的意见：
    “大跃进哩，每月只订五十公尺的计划，太不像话，至少要订一百公尺。”
    “书本里规定每月进度最多只能达到七十公尺。”技术员杨佐荣说。
    “书本上有没有像我们这样的大企业，书是人写的，我们只知道力争上游、多快好省，书本子上写的也不全对。”工人们质问杨佐荣。
    “咱们全国的挖洞月进度就没有一百公尺的。”
    后来工人们开会研究的结果，指标订的不是一百公尺，而是一百七十公尺。杨佐荣又说：
    “多快好省我不反对，但要有科学根据。你们看，一排炮只能进一公尺，一天放三次炮，只能进三公尺，一月顶多进九十公尺。你们订一百七十公尺的计划可能吗？”
    “好吧，我们干，你瞧吧！”工人这样回答杨佐荣。
    这里的职工决心来个生产基建双跃进，那时，洞子里的炮声刚刚响罢，运石的工人就冒着浓烟推着车子进去了。这时候，领导人通常用命令叫工人进行休息吃饭。他们的月进度不是一百七十公尺，而是二百三十公尺。在这样生动的事实面前，杨佐荣说：
    “我思想上落后，只是迷信书本，看不到工人阶级力量的伟大，今后我要好好地向工人同志学习。”
    这里工业建设的步步高的曲子，就这样地在白云深处演奏着。（附图片）
