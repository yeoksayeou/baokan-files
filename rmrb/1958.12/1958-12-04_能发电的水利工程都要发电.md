Our country's construction policy for the power industry is "water as the primary source, fire as a supplementary source." Whether the power industry can quickly catch up with the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture depends to a large extent on whether hydropower can develop at a faster pace, in addition to actively developing thermal power. Combining hydropower development with water conservancy construction is an important part of achieving high-speed hydropower development.

The nationwide upsurge in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring brought about an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, which is a glorious achievement. However, in the water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring, the principle of comprehensive utilization, especially in combining with power generation, was not sufficiently implemented. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 medium-sized water conservancy projects have been completed nationwide since last winter, including 1,592 reservoir projects, with a storage capacity of more than 25.9 billion cubic meters. If this amount of water could be fully utilized, the estimated installed capacity would be at least around one million kilowatts. However, in reality, only more than 200 projects are combined with power generation, with an installed capacity of only about 100,000 kilowatts, which is only one-tenth of the capacity that should be installed. The main structure of a hydropower station is the dam. Now that the dams have been built, but the power generation efficiency has not been fully utilized, this is a great loss. The CPC Central Committee recently emphasized in its instructions on water conservancy work that whether it is a small, medium, or general large-scale project, the primary reliance must be on the strength of the masses, supplemented by the strength of the state. Furthermore, it should be implemented with a focus on storage, to achieve the goal of fully and comprehensively utilizing water resources. We must strive to combine farmland irrigation, hydropower generation, and navigation as much as possible. This instruction tells us that all water conservancy projects that can generate electricity must generate electricity. This winter and next spring, the country will once again set off a nationwide upsurge in water conservancy and hydropower construction. This time, we must clearly establish the concept of comprehensive utilization, make full use of water resources, and strive to install more capacity and generate more electricity.

Some comrades believe that there is a contradiction between irrigation and power generation, and that meeting the requirements of irrigation makes it impossible to meet the requirements of power generation. This statement is incorrect. Irrigation and power generation do have certain contradictions in the allocation of water volume and the timing of water use. However, we should not only see the contradictory side, but also see the unified side. Facts have proven that the unified side is the main one. If the storage capacity of an existing reservoir is insufficient, the dam can be raised or a reservoir can be added upstream, depending on the specific conditions, to better regulate the water volume and meet the comprehensive requirements of power generation and other aspects. For reservoirs mainly used for irrigation, power generation is generally less stable due to the large changes in water volume and head. In such cases, the downstream irrigation system should be fully utilized for counter-regulation, and counter-regulation reservoirs can also be built downstream if necessary. In addition, appropriately adjusting the farming system and regulating water consumption within the irrigation area are also ways to unify the contradiction between irrigation and power generation. Some comrades have a mysterious view of running hydropower. They believe that electricity is invisible and intangible, and the technology is too complicated. It is okay to build a few or dozens of kilowatts of small rural hydropower stations, but to build medium-sized hydropower stations of thousands or tens of thousands of kilowatts is a matter for "experts." Is building hydropower stations mysterious? The answer to this question is: it is mysterious if you don't dare to touch it and encounter it; it is not mysterious if you dare to approach it and understand it. This is exactly the case. For example, Suining Prefecture in Sichuan Province did not dare to touch hydropower stations in the past. Later, under the vigorous call of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, they vigorously publicized the construction of hydropower stations, which not only broke the superstition that prefectures and counties could not build power stations, but also broke the superstition that prefectures and counties could not conduct surveys and designs. They designed several power stations of 6,000 or 7,000 kilowatts, which were not only well designed, but also greatly simplified the design procedures, accelerated the design speed, and reduced the construction cost. This example fully illustrates that the technology for running hydropower is completely within the grasp of the masses. The question is whether we have thoroughly liberated our minds and fully mobilized the strength and wisdom of the masses.

In the work steps of developing hydropower construction, we can first concentrate on a few key points, gain experience, and then promote it comprehensively. The National Medium-sized Water Conservancy and Hydropower Project Conference held in Zhengzhou not long ago determined that each prefecture should first build a hydropower station of around 500 to 1,000 kilowatts this winter and next spring to learn from experience and promote comprehensive development. This is practical and feasible. If all regions can earnestly implement it, it may be possible to strive for medium-sized hydropower stations to blossom all over the country.

The supply of complete sets of power generation equipment is a fundamental problem in hydropower construction. All regions should pay special attention to solving it. The manufacturing of hydropower equipment is generally relatively simple, and factories in machinery, railway, transportation, mining, and other departments can be mobilized to participate in manufacturing. The upsurge in national water conservancy construction has begun. We hope that the secretaries of party organizations at all levels will take charge of this matter personally and strive to seize the opportunity to launch an upsurge in hydropower construction at the same time as the upsurge in water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, in order to alleviate the tight power situation next year and enable the "vanguard" to get ahead as soon as possible.

    能发电的水利工程都要发电
    本报评论员
    水主火辅，是我国电力工业的建设方针。电力工业能不能快马加鞭赶上工农业大跃进的需要，除了积极发展火电外，在很大程度上决定于水电能不能以更高的速度发展。要高速度地发展水电，同水利建设结合起来发电，是一个重要环节。
    去冬今春全民性的水利建设高潮，使我国今年的农业生产获得空前大丰收，这是一个辉煌的成就。但是在去冬今春所修建的水利工程中，对贯彻综合利用的原则，尤其是结合发电方面，做得不够。根据不完全的统计，去年冬季以来全国共完成中型水利工程三千余处，其中水库工程一千五百九十二处，蓄水量达二百五十九亿多公方。这么多的水如能充分利用，估计装机容量至少在一百万瓩左右。但是，实际上结合发电的只二百余处，装机容量只十万瓩左右，仅为应该装机量的十分之一。水电站的主要工程是大坝，大坝建造起来了，而没有充分发挥发电的效能，这是一个很大的损失。最近中共中央在关于水利工作的指示中曾强调指出：在兴修水利工程时，不论是小型工程、中型工程或一般大型工程，必须依靠群众力量为主，国家力量为辅。并且应当实行以蓄为主，达到充分综合利用水利资源的目的。力求农田灌溉、水力发电、航运尽可能互相结合。这个指示告诉我们，能发电的水利工程都必须发电。今冬明春全国又要掀起一个全民性的水利水电建设高潮。这一次，我们一定要明确树立综合利用的观点，充分利用水力资源，争取多装机，多发电。
    有些同志认为灌溉和发电有矛盾，满足了灌溉的要求就无法满足发电的要求。这种说法是不正确的。灌溉和发电在用水量的分配上和用水的时间上是有一定的矛盾；但是，不要只看到它们矛盾的一面，同时还应当看到统一的一面。事实证明，统一的一面是主要的。已建成的水库若蓄水量不足，根据具体条件，可考虑把坝加高或在上游添筑水库，以更好地调节水量，满足发电和其他方面的综合要求。以灌溉为主的水库，由于水量和水头变化较大，发电一般地不太稳定。在这样的情况下，应当充分利用下游灌溉系统进行反调节，必要时还可在下游修建反调节水库。此外，在灌溉区内适当调整耕作制度，调剂用水量，也都是统一灌溉和发电矛盾的办法。有些同志对办水电存在着神秘观点。他们认为电看不见，摸不着，技术太复杂，搞几个或几十瓩的农村小型水电站还差不多，要搞几千或几万瓩的中型水电站，那是“内行”的事情。搞水电站神秘不神秘呢？对这个问题的回答是：如果不敢去摸它，碰它，那就神秘；如敢于去接触它，认识它，那就不神秘。事实也正是这样。如四川遂宁专区过去对办水电站也是不敢去摸的，后来在四川省委的大力号召下，他们对办水电站进行了大张旗鼓的宣传，不仅破除了专区和县不能修建电站的迷信，而且也打破了专区和县不能勘测设计的迷信。他们设计了好几个六、七千瓩的发电站，不仅设计得很好，而且大大简化了设计手续，加快了设计速度，降低了建设成本。这一个例子充分地说明了办水电的技术是完全可以被群众掌握的。问题在于我们是不是彻底解放了思想，充分发动了群众的力量和智慧。
    在开展水电建设的工作步骤上，可以先集中搞几个重点，取得经验以后，再全面推广。不久以前在郑州召开的全国中型水利水电工程会议确定，今冬明春每个专区先建一个五百到一千瓩上下的水电站，以求吸取经验，推动全面。这是切实可行的。各地区如能认真实行，就有可能争取中型水电站在全国范围内遍地开花。
    成套发电设备的供应，是目前水电建设中一个带根本性的问题。各地要特别注意抓紧解决。水力发电设备的制造一般比较简单，可以动员机械厂和铁路、交通、矿山等部门的工厂都来参加制造。全国水利建设高潮已经开始到来了，我们希望各级党组织的书记亲自动手抓这件事，力求做到不失时机，在今冬明春的水利建设的高潮中，同时掀起一个水电建设的高潮，以缓和明年电力紧张的局面，使“先行官”尽早地赶到前面去。
