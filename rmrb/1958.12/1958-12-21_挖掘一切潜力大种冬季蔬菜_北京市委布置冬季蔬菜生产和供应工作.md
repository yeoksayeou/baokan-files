Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the 17th to discuss and arrange vegetable production and supply work from now until the end of April next year. The meeting was attended by the secretaries of the district and county committees of the suburbs and the party secretaries and directors of the people's communes mainly engaged in vegetable production.

To solve the problem of vegetable supply during the off-season before the end of April next year, the meeting requested that all people's communes mainly engaged in vegetable production must vigorously mobilize commune members to expand winter vegetable production and do a good job in the storage and marketing of autumn vegetables. Currently, we must first fully tap the potential of existing equipment such as windbreak greenhouses and solar greenhouses to greatly increase the production of winter vegetables. The vacant cultivation area of existing greenhouses, the vacant seedling solar greenhouses, and the open spaces in vegetable cellars must be fully utilized. The original cold-covered solar greenhouses should be covered with glass, and most of the solar greenhouses can be converted into connected greenhouses, cutting off the cave edges to expand the cultivation area and increase production.

To ensure the supply of vegetables in early spring next year, the meeting also requested the relevant people's communes to vigorously develop windbreak solar greenhouse production and plant fast-maturing vegetables such as small spinach, small Chinese cabbage, and small oilseed rape. In expanding winter vegetable production, all communes must fully mobilize the masses, overcome the difficulties of insufficient means of production in the spirit of self-reliance. At the same time, we must strengthen the storage of existing vegetables, assign special personnel to manage them, prevent spoilage, and increase the amount of vegetables on the market. The shed vegetable stalks and leaves stored in cellars should be processed and pickled as much as possible. The meeting also requested that districts and counties in the outer suburbs, in the spirit of saving vegetables and supporting the city, appropriately supply some commercial vegetables to the capital.

The meeting requested all people's communes in the suburbs to do a good job in the political and ideological work of cadres and the masses, and explain to cadres and commune members that supplying vegetables to the city is a political task for the entire party and people in the suburbs and a glorious obligation that all suburban farmers should fulfill, and they must do their best to do it well.

The responsible cadres of the districts, counties, and communes who attended the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to do a good job in off-season vegetable production and supply after discussion. Commercial departments are also actively improving vegetable supply work.

    挖掘一切潜力大种冬季蔬菜
    北京市委布置冬季蔬菜生产和供应工作
    新华社20日讯  中共北京市委在17日召开了会议，讨论布置了从现在到明年4月底以前的蔬菜生产和供应工作。参加会议的有郊区各区、县委书记和以生产蔬菜为主的人民公社的党委书记和主任。
    为了解决明年4月底以前淡季的蔬菜供应问题，这次会议要求以生产蔬菜为主的各人民公社，当前必须大力发动社员扩大冬季蔬菜生产和作好秋菜保管、上市等工作。当前必须首先充分挖掘风障温室、阳畦等现有设备的潜力，大量增产冬季蔬菜。对现有温室的空闲栽培面积、空闲的育苗阳畦和菜窖中的空地，都要加以充分利用。原有的冷盖阳畦要加盖玻璃，大部分阳畦可以改成联畦，削去洞帮，以扩大栽培面积，增加生产。
    为了保证明年早春蔬菜的供应，会议并要求各有关人民公社大力发展风障阳畦生产，种植小菠菜、小白菜、小油菜等快熟蔬菜。在扩大冬季蔬菜生产工作中，各社要充分发动群众，本着自力更生的精神，克服生产资料不足的困难。同时，要加强现贮蔬菜的保管，指定专人管理，防止腐烂，增加上市量。窖存脱落的菜帮、菜叶，要尽量加工腌制。会议还要求远郊各区、县本着节约用菜、支援城市的精神，适当供应首都一部分商品菜。
    会议要求郊区各人民公社，充分作好干部和群众的政治思想工作，向干部和社员说明，供应城市蔬菜，是当前郊区全党全民的一项政治任务，是郊区全体农民应尽的光荣义务，必须尽最大努力把它作好。
    到会的区、县、社的负责干部经过讨论，一致表示有决心作好淡季蔬菜生产和供应工作。商业部门也正在积极改进蔬菜供应工作。
