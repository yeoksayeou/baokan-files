Caring for the Masses' Well-being Can Improve Labor Efficiency
Liu Sheng-san, Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Pangong People's Commune Committee, Xiangyang County, Hubei

    In accordance with the instructions of the higher-level Party committee on caring for the well-being of the masses, our commune has insisted on an eight-hour workday and implemented a holiday system. We are taking various measures to combine hard work with rest and recuperation.

    Many cadres still do not understand the correct relationship between production and life, hard work and rest. When discussing the implementation of the holiday system, they often worry that production tasks cannot be completed and still advocate for non-stop hard work. The actual effect is exactly the opposite of their expectations. After implementing the eight-hour workday and the holiday system, production has actually increased and been promoted. For example, the engineering team of more than 4,000 people sent by the commune to repair the Handan Railway used to work 14 hours a day, including overtime, and only completed 1.8 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. Now, without overtime, adhering to the eight-hour workday, and striving to reform tools and improve labor organization, work efficiency has more than doubled, with each person completing 3.7 cubic meters of earthwork per day, and the highest reaching 4 cubic meters. Guanyin Brigade, the commune with the least labor, after drawing five-thirds of its people to repair railways and run industries, not only ensured that the deep plowing reached more than one foot, timely weeded the wheat and applied fertilizer, but also supported the Hongqi Brigade in Hanbei District in doing a good job of field management. This shows that taking care of the necessary rest of the members will only improve labor efficiency, improve work quality, and better complete tasks.

    Here, the leadership's in-depth connection with the masses and the cadres' pragmatic work style are very important issues. Based on my experience, cadres who eat, live, and work with the masses will definitely care about the well-being of the masses. During the Great Leap Forward in steel production, I stayed up for three nights and felt dizzy when I walked. I felt I couldn't bear it anymore, and thinking that the masses couldn't bear it either, I immediately forced myself to find a solution to this problem. I believe that it is necessary to emphasize the rectification of the cadres' work style, promote hard work and going deep among the masses, and eating, living, and working with the masses. This is the key to doing a good job in the well-being of the masses and organizing a greater leap forward in production next year.

    关心群众生活，就能提高劳动效率
    中共湖北襄阳县庞公人民公社委员会书记  刘盛三
    根据上级党委关心群众生活的指示，我们社里坚持了每日八小时的工作制度，实行了休假日制度。我们正在采取各种措施，将苦战和休整结合起来。
    许多干部，现在还不懂得生产和生活、苦战和休整的正确关系。在讨论实行休假日制度时，他们常常担心生产任务不能完成，仍然主张无休息的苦战。实际效果恰巧和他们的预料相反，实行八小时工作制和休假日制度后，反而提高了生产、促进了生产。如社里派去修汉丹铁路的四千多人的工程队，过去加夜班时每人每天工作十四小时，才完成一点八方土。现在不加夜班，坚持八小时工作制，努力改革工具，改善劳动组织，工效反而提高一倍多，每人每日完成三点七方土，最高的达到了四方土。社里劳力最少的观音大队，抽出五分之三的人去修铁路、办工业以后，不仅保证了深耕地达一尺以上，及时薅完麦草追上肥，还支援汉北区红旗大队搞好了田间管理。这说明照顾社员必要的休息，只会提高劳动效率，提高工作质量，更好地完成任务。
    在这里，领导的深入群众和干部的实事求是作风，是很重要的问题。根据我的体会，凡是与群众同吃同住同劳动的干部，一定会关心群众生活的。大办钢铁时，我熬了三个夜，走起路来都是昏昏沉沉的，我觉得熬不下去了，联想到群众也熬不下去了，马上就迫使我想法解决这个问题。我认为当前有必要着重强调整顿干部作风，提倡艰苦深入，与群众同吃同住同劳动，这是作好群众生活工作、组织明年生产更大跃进的关键。
