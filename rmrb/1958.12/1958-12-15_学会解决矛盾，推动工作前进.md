Learn to Resolve Contradictions and Promote Work
Sergeant Squad Leader Li Xueshu, a member of the PLA stationed in Kunming

At the beginning of training this year, three people in our squad had ideological problems. After the Great Leap Forward began, other squads formulated advanced plans and made great achievements. I was very anxious and wanted to formulate an advanced plan to promote our work. However, after the plan was formulated, three people disagreed during the squad meeting, which left our squad far behind the entire company. Whenever a task was assigned, we could not complete it. Taking the professional anti-aircraft machine gun operation as an example, other squads could set up the anti-aircraft gun架枪 in fifteen seconds, but it took us twenty-seven seconds.

At that time, my view of these problems was: if someone is not active in their work and has ideological problems, criticize them; if a task is not completed, ask them why. However, as a result, their ideological problems not only were not resolved but became even worse. Therefore, I was very distressed. I thought, I am the squad leader and the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. I have a responsibility to help and educate the League members and young people in the entire company who have ideological problems. But now, I can't even educate the comrades in my own squad, so how can I educate others? Later, I remembered that the instructor once said, "Studying philosophy can make people smarter and give them more ideas." Therefore, I began to study "On Contradiction."

Analyzing Contradictions and Grasping the Main Contradiction

After studying "On Contradiction," I understood that contradictions are universal. The movement of contradictions is the movement of things; resolving contradictions is progress. Therefore, we should pay attention to exposing contradictions, analyzing contradictions, and resolving contradictions in our work, instead of being afraid of contradictions.

Thus, I began to analyze the contradictions existing in our squad. After analysis, I believed that the contradictions in our squad included: the contradiction between individual interests and collective interests; the contradiction between advanced thinking and backward thinking; the contradiction of disunity between the deputy squad leader and the squad leader and the contradiction of disunity between the squad's soldiers; the contradiction between man and technology, and so on. To do a good job, we must resolve these contradictions. However, "On Contradiction" says: "In the study of any complex process, if it consists of more than two contradictions, we must devote every effort to discover its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can readily be solved." Among these contradictions in our squad, which is the principal contradiction? I thought: whichever problem has the greatest impact on the squad's training, work, and study, that is the principal contradiction. At this time, I found that the contradiction between individualism and collectivism was the principal contradiction. Because of its existence, some comrades became passive when their work was slightly unsatisfactory, and they just wanted to sleep all day long, with no one caring about the other. This seriously hindered the progress of the entire squad.

However, the contradiction between individual and collective interests was prominently manifested in three comrades, among whom there was a primary and secondary distinction. So, who is the main contradiction? One of these three comrades is the deputy squad leader, who is a member of the Communist Youth League and a veteran who enlisted in 1955. In a squad, besides the squad leader, he is the leader of the entire squad, and his words and deeds play a leading role for the soldiers. The other two are soldiers, young people, who look to the deputy squad leader for everything. Therefore, the contradiction of the deputy squad leader is the main one, and the contradiction of the two soldiers is secondary.

How to resolve the aspect that plays a leading role in the contradiction? "On Contradiction" tells us: "Among the various contradictions, whether principal or secondary, can the two aspects of the contradiction be treated equally? No, they cannot." It also says: "Of the two aspects of a contradiction, one must be principal and the other secondary. The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction." This means that to resolve contradictions, we must not only grasp the principal contradiction but also find the principal aspect of the contradiction. What is the principal aspect of the deputy squad leader's contradiction? That is, he one-sidedly emphasized individual interests, so he was not active in his work and had serious thoughts of leaving the team. Therefore, we must transform negative emotions from the principal aspect of the contradiction to the secondary aspect, and transform positive emotions from the secondary aspect of the contradiction to the principal aspect. Also, because the method of resolving internal contradictions is "to convince people with reason, criticism and self-criticism," I seized the principal aspect of the deputy squad leader's contradiction and talked with him heart to heart.

In-depth Talks to Resolve Contradictions

Before starting the heart-to-heart talks, I first made a self-criticism to everyone in the squad. I explained that in the past, I did very little to manage the squad's work. Whenever the work was not done well, I often did not look for the reason, nor did I explain to the comrades why we could not do it this way, but simply gave a blunt criticism. Furthermore, I stated that I must correct myself in the future. Then, I quoted the principles of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists" on how individual interests should be subordinate to collective interests to talk to the deputy squad leader. However, he not only did not listen but said, "Books are books, things are things," and cannot be linked together. So, I changed to using the method of comparing the old and new societies, combined with his class origin to talk to him. I brought out all the suffering he had endured in the old society and compared his original life with his current life. At the same time, I also told him that our army is one of the superstructures. If no one is willing to be a soldier, then our country will not have an army to protect it, and the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will come to kill and set fires again, and the landlords will come to oppress the people again. Where would we have any individual interests and happiness at that time? Now that we protect the people's regime, we have the interests of the country and the people, and don't we also have individual interests? This touched his heart. For nearly a week, he struggled fiercely in his mind, but finally, he slowly changed for the better. Later, he was very active in everything he did, and his help and leadership to the comrades in the squad were also better than in the past. The deputy squad leader's contradiction was basically resolved.

While resolving the principal contradiction, we must not ignore the resolution of secondary contradictions, because the principal and secondary contradictions can also transform under certain conditions. Therefore, while concentrating the main force to resolve the deputy squad leader's contradiction, I also educated the two soldiers. Because the deputy squad leader's ideological problem was resolved, these two comrades gradually changed for the better after education.

Resolving Contradictions Promotes Work

The resolution of the principal contradiction greatly facilitated the resolution of secondary contradictions. As comrades overcame individualism, all ideological problems were readily solved. A good atmosphere of learning and progress appeared in the squad, and the comrades' ideological consciousness also increased. During the infantry weapons shooting period, everyone practiced aiming at noon without resting, and as a result, the entire squad received an overall excellent rating. In the professional subjects, regarding the contradiction between man and technology, because the comrades' ideological problems were resolved, everyone worked hard and skillfully, and gave play to their subjective initiative, creating an enlarged sight box. At the same time, everyone humbly learned from the advanced experiences of other squads. This enabled our operation to quickly catch up with the advanced, and we could complete the anti-aircraft 架枪 action in just twelve or thirteen seconds. We also caught up with other squads in other work. Therefore, we were rated as a five-good model squad. After that, in the professional anti-aircraft machine gun live ammunition shooting, we were always excellent every time, and won the glorious title of a full year of shooting results being excellent.

The resolution of these contradictions in our squad fully demonstrates that the power of Marxist-Leninist philosophy is infinite. In the future, I will work harder to learn philosophy well, deeply, and thoroughly, to do a better job and better serve the people.

    学会解决矛盾，推动工作前进
    解放军驻昆明部队某部中士班长  李学书
    今年训练开始时，我们这个班有三个人闹思想问题。大跃进开始后，别的班制订了先进计划，并且做出了很大的成绩。我心里怪着急，也想制订一个先进的计划来推动工作。但是，计划制订好后，在班务会上进行讨论时，有三个人不同意，这就使全班远远地落在全连的后边。当每一项任务交下来时，我们总是完成不了。拿专业的高射机枪操来说，别的班是十五秒架完高射架枪，可是我们要二十七秒。
    当时，我对这些问题的看法是：工作不积极，闹思想问题，就给他个批评；任务完不成，就问他几个为什么。可是，结果他们的思想问题不但没有解决，反而闹得更加厉害了。因此，我非常苦闷。我想，我是班长，是共青团的副支书。全连的团员和青年群众有思想问题，我是有责任帮助和教育他们的。可是，现在连本班的同志都教育不过来，那又怎能教育别人呢？后来，我想起有一次指导员说过，“学习哲学可以使人变聪明，办法多”。因此，我就开始学“矛盾论”。分析矛盾抓住主要矛盾
    学习“矛盾论”后，我懂得了矛盾是普遍存在着的。矛盾的运动，就是事物的运动；解决矛盾就是进步。因此，我们在工作中应该注意揭露矛盾，分析矛盾，解决矛盾，而不应该害怕矛盾。
    这样，我就开始分析班里所存在的矛盾。经过分析，我认为存在于我们班里的矛盾有：个人利益和集体利益的矛盾；先进思想和落后思想的矛盾；正副班长不团结，班里战士之间不团结的矛盾；人和技术的矛盾等等。要把工作搞好，就要解决这些矛盾。但是，“矛盾论”中说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它主要的矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”在我们班这些矛盾中，哪个是主要矛盾呢？我想：哪个问题对本班的训练、工作、学习等任务影响最大，哪个就是主要矛盾。这时，我发现个人主义和集体主义利益的矛盾是主要的矛盾。由于它的存在，一部分同志在工作上稍不遂意，就消极起来了，而且成天光想睡觉，一个不管一个。这就严重地妨碍了全班的进步。
    但是，个人利益和集体利益的矛盾又突出地表现在三个同志的身上，其中又有主次之分。那末，谁是主要的矛盾呢？这三个同志中有一个是副班长，他是共青团员，又是1955年入伍的老战士。在一个班内，除班长外，他就是全班的领导，他的言行对战士是起着领导作用的。其他两个是战士，是青年群众，不管什么都看着副班长。因此，副班长的矛盾是主要的，两个战士的矛盾是次要的。找到了矛盾起主导作用的方面怎样解决呢？“矛盾论”中告诉我们：“在各种矛盾之中，不论是主要的或次要的，矛盾着的两个方面，又是否可以平均看待呢？也是不可以的。”又说：“矛盾着的两方面中，必有一方面是主要的，他方面是次要的。其主要的方面，即所谓矛盾起主导作用的方面。”这就是说，解决矛盾不但要抓主要矛盾，而且要找矛盾的主要方面。副班长这个矛盾的主要方面是什么呢？那就是他片面强调了个人利益，因而工作不积极，离队思想严重。因此，就必须使消极情绪从矛盾主要方面转为次要方面，而使积极情绪从矛盾的次要方面转为主要方面。又因为解决内部矛盾的方法是“以理服人，批评与自我批评”，所以我就抓住了副班长这个矛盾的主要方面，进行谈心。深入谈心解决矛盾
    在没有开始谈心以前，我先在班内向大家作了检讨。我说明了过去我对班里的工作管得很少，一遇到工作做不好，常常不去寻找它的原因，也不向同志们讲清为什么不能这样做的道理，而只是生硬地批评一顿。并且，我表示今后一定要改过。接着我就引用了刘少奇同志“论共产党员的修养”中关于个人利益应该服从集体利益的道理来对副班长谈。可是，他不但不听，反而说“书是书、事是事”，不能联在一起。于是，我就改用新旧对比的方法，结合着他的阶级出身来谈。我把他在旧社会所受的苦楚全部摆出来，又用他原来的生活和现在的生活作了对比。同时，我又对他说，我们军队是上层建筑之一，如果谁也不愿当兵，那末我们的国家就没有军队来保护，帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团就又会来杀人放火，地主也就又会来压迫人民，那时我们哪里还有什么个人的利益和幸福呢？现在我们保卫好人民的政权，就有了国家人民的利益，不也就有了个人的利益了吗？这就打动了他的心。在将近一个礼拜的时间，他思想斗争得很厉害，但是终于慢慢转变好了。后来，他不管做什么事都很积极，对班内的同志们的帮助和领导也比过去好了。副班长的矛盾算是基本解决了。
    在解决主要矛盾的同时，也不能忽视次要矛盾的解决，因为主要矛盾和次要矛盾在一定的条件下也会转化。因此，我一方面集中主要力量解决副班长的矛盾，同时也对两个战士进行教育。由于副班长的思想问题得到解决，这两个同志经过教育也逐渐转变好了。解决了矛盾推动了工作
    主要矛盾的解决，大大地有利于次要矛盾的解决。由于同志们克服了个人主义，一切思想问题都迎刃而解了。在班内出现了好学上进的气氛，同志们的思想觉悟也随着提高了。在步兵武器射击期间，大家在中午的时候都不休息地去练习瞄准，结果全班总评优秀。在专业科目中，关于人和技术的矛盾，由于同志们的思想问题解决了，大家进行了勤学巧练，发挥了主观能动性，创造了一个扩大瞄准具箱。同时，大家又虚心地学习了别班的先进经验。这就使我们的操作，很快地赶过了当时的先进者，只要十二、三秒就把高射架枪的动作做完。在其他工作上，我们也赶过了别班。因此，我们被评为五好标兵班。此后，在专业高射机枪实弹射击中，我们每次又都是优秀，获得了全年射击成绩满堂红的光荣称号。
    我们班的这些矛盾的解决，充分地说明了马克思列宁主义哲学的力量是无穷无尽的。今后，我一定要更加努力把哲学学好、学深、学透，来把工作搞得更好，更好地为人民服务。
