    A Glorious Job
    Our public mess hall was established in July, with over a hundred people eating there.
    After the mess hall was set up, I was chosen by the masses to be a cook. Since we started eating collectively, I always felt that there were too many people eating, too many mouths to feed, and things were difficult to manage. Due to a lack of understanding of this job, I felt unstable and would rather participate in agricultural labor than do the cooking. Fortunately, the Party Branch Secretary and the production team leader went deep into the mess hall, personally helping with management, and patiently educated me on my incorrect thinking. At that time, my ideological struggle was quite intense, and the other two cooks were also affected by me and were not at ease in their work. Seeing that the commune members' meals were affected, not only could we not guarantee meal times, but the food could not be varied, affecting the commune members' morale and production. Under these circumstances, I gradually realized that the work of a cook is a responsible and glorious thing. It is a noble labor that is related to the development of production and the guarantee of the commune members' health, and it is one of the major issues in further consolidating the people's commune. Because my understanding has improved, I am determined to wholeheartedly do a good job in cooking and find ways to improve the food from all aspects. We follow the principles of eating enough, eating well, and eating frugally, and have made adjustments to the original standard of living, making the food diversified and attractive in every way.

    光荣的工作
    我们的公共食堂是在7月份办起来的，共有一百多人吃饭。
    食堂办起后，我被群众选为炊事员。从集体上灶吃饭以来，总觉着吃饭人多，嘴多，事情难办。由于对这个工作认识不足，情绪不安定，宁愿参加农业劳动，不愿搞炊事工作。恰好党支书和生产队长深入食堂，亲自帮助管理，对我的不正确的思想进行了耐心的教育。在这个时候，我的思想斗争得相当激烈，另外两个炊事员也受我的影响，不安心工作。眼看着社员吃饭受到影响，不仅不能保证开饭时间，饭菜也不能改变花样，影响社员情绪，影响了生产。在这种情况下，我逐渐认识到炊事员的工作是一件责任重大而又光荣的事情。是关系着生产发展、保证社员身体健康的崇高的劳动，是进一步巩固人民公社的重大问题之一。由于认识提高了，我就下定决心，一心一意搞好炊事工作，并从各方面想办法改进伙食。我们本着吃饱、吃好、吃省的原则，在原来的生活水平上进行了调剂，使饭食多样化，样样吸引人。青海省互助土族自治县  北山人民公社藏族炊事员  东娃卡措
