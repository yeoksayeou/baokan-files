Rectification of the Commune Begins with Issues of Utmost Concern to the Masses
Zhangji Commune Mobilizes the Masses to Speak Out, Focusing on Key Issues, Undertaking Major Rectification and Transformation
    (Our Dispatch) The Zhangji People's Commune in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, after successfully concluding the autumn harvest and winter planting, launched a mass-scale socialist education movement of extensive speaking out, major rectification, and transformation on December 3rd. Currently, it is in a high tide of simultaneous rectification and transformation based on in-depth speaking out.
    The Zhangji Commune's socialist education movement is centered on winter production, starting with the concrete improvement of distribution and final accounting. At the beginning of the movement, it was the tail end of the autumn harvest and a period of intense field management. Sideline production had not yet been fully developed. Commune members were eager to recover the cotton and sweet potatoes left in the fields to better engage in field management and sideline production. At the same time, many commune members were unclear about the commune's income and distribution this year, especially since the implementation of a combined wage and supply system. Commune members were particularly concerned about whether their income would increase this year compared to last year. In response to this situation, the commune's Party Committee specifically arranged the current agricultural and sideline production and distribution of final accounts. Regarding agricultural and sideline production: It was decided to spend three days to quickly finish the autumn harvest and weed and fertilize wheat fields; a diversified operations office was established, with dedicated personnel assigned to lead diversified operations; and a plan for sideline production this winter and next spring was formulated. Regarding the distribution of final accounts: The commune and teams conducted inventory checks and published accounts. Based on this, the proportion of accumulation and consumption was specifically determined, and teams with large production increases were given preferential treatment. Then, on a household basis, the income of each commune member's household this year was compared with that of last year, to achieve "every household understands the accounts, everyone is clear." After such accounting, all 403 households in the Chengxiang Brigade saw an increase in income compared to 1957.
    The Zhangji People's Commune, due to its short establishment time, lacked experience among cadres and the masses in running the People's Commune. Some cadres and commune members had an unclear understanding of the superiority of the People's Commune and the combined wage and supply distribution system, and were not active enough in production, saying things like, "Whether you work or not, you get three meals a day; whether you do it or not, wages are guaranteed." Others mistakenly believed that everything should be turned over to the public. After analyzing the ideological trends of various social strata, the Commune Party Committee, while focusing on production and distribution, promptly strengthened socialist and communist ideological education for commune members, vigorously promoting and implementing the specific policies of the People's Commune.
    On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, clarifying policies, and understanding the superiority of the People's Commune, the Commune Party Committee resolutely implemented the mass line, fully mobilizing the masses to carry out a movement of extensive speaking out, big character posters. The Party Committee first convened a Party branch meeting of the Chengxiang Brigade, a key point for the socialist education movement, and a meeting of cadres above the platoon leader level, arming the cadres' minds and clarifying the purpose and significance of the socialist education movement. Then, on a brigade basis, meetings of commune member representatives, small-scale forums, and field debates were held, combining individual visits with meeting activities to ensure that people said what was on their minds. In just three days, members of Chengxiang and Xinguang Brigades alone submitted 392 opinions through speaking out and big character posters. The leadership guided the masses to specifically summarize the superiority of the People's Commune. In the discussion, commune members unanimously agreed that the People's Commune was more superior than the agricultural cooperative. Because the People's Commune is larger and more public, the commune was able to transfer more than 700 laborers shortly after its establishment to establish a sideline production area on barren hills and grasslands, open up a livestock farm, raise 19,000 pigs, 1,000 cattle, 5,718 sheep, as well as flour mills, wineries, and oil presses; and establish collective welfare undertakings such as homes for the elderly, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, and public canteens. The production of the entire commune has increased several times over last year, and the average income of commune members has also increased by more than 49% compared with last year. Some commune members who misunderstood the policies and could not see the superiority of the commune clarified their thinking after discussion.
    During the speaking-out process, commune members spoke frankly and exhaustively. Through speaking out and writing big character posters, everyone felt happy and motivated.
    The Commune Party Committee always implemented the principle of simultaneous rectification and transformation and further mobilized the masses to speak out through rectification. In terms of rectification steps, the Commune Party Committee classified and prioritized the opinions of commune members according to their urgency and importance, and first focused on solving the problems of commune members' livelihood and welfare. For example, after some commune members raised concerns on December 6 about the lack of cloth ration tickets and quilts for the winter, the commune issued 27,000 feet of cloth ration tickets based on the need to reward cotton sales to each team on the 7th, which had been issued to commune members by each team according to the actual situation. In this way, 790 quilts, 165 cotton-padded jackets, and 465 cotton-padded trousers were quickly resolved. After commune member Fu Yunchang raised the issue on December 6 that the commune had borrowed his house and had not arranged winter housing for him, a house was found for his family on the 7th. For canteens that lacked vegetables and noodles, the commune allocated soybeans and wheat, asking commune members to make tofu, sprout soybeans, and eat noodles. Four of the five canteens in Xinguang Brigade originally did not provide vegetables. After speaking out and rectification, there are now 42 kinds of staple and non-staple foods. Canteen No. 1 has not had the same meal for four or five consecutive days since December. Commune members generally reflected that the cooks had "become skillful"!
    While solving the welfare problems of commune members, the Commune Party Committee also strengthened business management in all aspects, specifically solved the problem of how to arrange labor, implemented a quota management method of five-fixed piecework, and implemented the production responsibility system. Regarding distribution and grading issues, the Commune Party Committee also conducted some typical investigations and found that some commune members, such as handicraftsmen, feeders, and those with few people and strong labor, had reduced their income after implementing the supply system. After research, it was prepared to adopt technical subsidies, overproduction rewards, and appropriate adjustments to the level system, which would be implemented after discussion and approval by the commune member representative meeting. The issues of cattle breeding and farm tool storage were also initially determined to implement the methods of "six fixes" (fixed person for cattle, fixed number of heads, fixed feed, fixed fatness, fixed breeding, fixed rewards and punishments) and "three guarantees" (farm tool storage guaranteed to households, guaranteed number of pieces, guaranteed rewards and punishments). For other issues that need to be studied, the Commune Party Committee also decided to explain them to the commune members separately, so as to achieve answers for everything and solutions for everything.
    After such a major rectification and transformation, the commune members were in high spirits. For example, after commune member Fu Yunchang saw that the commune solved his housing problem on the 7th after he raised his opinion on the 6th, he raised three more opinions that day. After speaking out and rectification, the labor attendance rate of Xinguang Brigade increased from 80% to 100%, and the weeding efficiency increased from one mu per person per day to 1.5 mu.
    Now, the Zhangji Commune is entering a high tide of major rectification and transformation on the basis of in-depth speaking out.

    从群众最关心的问题入手整社
    张集公社发动群众鸣放，抓主要问题，大整大改
    本报讯  湖北光化县张集人民公社在胜利结束秋收、冬播以后，从12月3日起，开展了一个群众性的大鸣大放、大整大改的整社运动。现正在深入鸣放的基础上，进入了边整边改的高潮。
    张集公社的整社运动，是以冬季生产为中心，从具体搞好分配决算入手的。整社开始时，正值秋收煞尾和田间管理的紧张时期，副业生产还没有全面开展起来，社员们都迫切要求把丢在地里的棉花、红苕收回来后，好大搞田间管理和副业生产。同时，不少社员对今年社的收入和分配问题不摸底，特别是自实行工资制和供给制相结合的办法以后，社员们对自己今年是否比去年增加收入特别关心。根据这一情况，社党委会具体安排了当前农副业生产和分配决算工作。在农副业生产方面：决定以三天时间突击搞好秋收煞尾和麦田除草追肥；成立了多种经营办公室，抽出专人领导多种经营；制订了今冬明春的副业生产规划。在分配决算方面：社、队都分别进行了清仓盘点和公布了账目，在此基础上，具体确定了积累与消费比例、对增产幅度大的队给以照顾，然后再以户为单位，计算每户社员今年和去年的收入对比，达到“户户算账，人人心亮”的目的。城乡大队四百零三户社员，经这样算账后，户户都比1957年增加收入。
    张集人民公社由于建社时间短，干部和群众对办好人民公社都缺乏经验，有些干部、社员对人民公社的优越性和工资制供给制相结合的分配制度认识不清，在生产上不够积极，说什么：“干不干，一天三顿饭，搞不搞，工资少不了”，还有的误认为一切都要归公。公社党委会在分析各阶层思想动态以后，在大抓生产、分配的同时，就抓紧了对社员进行社会主义和共产主义思想教育，大张旗鼓的宣传贯彻人民公社的各项具体政策。
    在统一思想认识，明确政策和人民公社优越性的基础上，公社党委会便坚决贯彻群众路线，充分的发动群众，开展了大鸣、大放和万张大字报运动，让社员们畅所欲言。党委会首先召开了整社重点城乡大队的党支部大会和排长以上的干部会，武装了干部思想，明确了整社的目的和意义，然后以大队为单位，分别召开社员代表会、小型座谈会、地头辩论会，通过个别访问和会议活动相结合的办法，做到有啥说啥。仅城乡、新光两个大队，社员们在三天内就通过鸣放和大字报，提出了三百九十二条意见。领导群众具体总结人民公社的优越性。在讨论中，社员们一致认为人民公社要比农业社更优越。因为人民公社又大又公，社里才能在建社后不久，就抽调了七百多名劳力在荒山草坡上建立了一个副业区，开辟了一个畜牧场，养了一万九千头猪，一千头牛，五千七百一十八只羊，还有粉坊、酒厂、油坊等；兴办了敬老院、幼儿园、妇产院、公共食堂等集体福利事业。整个社的生产比去年成番的增加，社员每人平均收入也比去年增长49％以上。有些社员因对政策误解，看不到公社的优越性，经过讨论后，思想都明确了。
    在鸣放过程中，社员们都做到了知无不言、言无不尽，通过鸣放和写大字报，人人心情舒畅，个个干劲倍增。
    公社党委始终贯彻了边整边改方针，并通过整改去进一步发动群众鸣放。在整改步骤上，公社党委把社员鸣放意见，根据先后缓急分类排队后，首先抓紧解决了社员生活福利问题。如12月6日部分社员提出了过冬没布票、缺棉絮以后，公社在7日就按需要发给各队卖棉花奖励布票二万七千尺，已由各队根据实际情况发给了社员。这样很快就解决了七百九十床被子，一百六十五件棉袄，四百六十五件棉裤。社员傅云昌12月6日提出了社里借用了他的房子没给他安置过冬房屋后，7日就给他家找了房子住。对缺菜吃和没面吃的食堂，社里都给调拨了黄豆，小麦，叫社员们磨豆腐、生豆芽和吃面条。新光大队五个食堂，有四个食堂原来不供给菜，经鸣放整改后，现在主副食菜共有四十二种。第一排食堂从12月以来连续四五天不吃重样饭，社员们都普遍反映炊事员“学巧了”！
    在解决社员福利问题的同时，公社党委还从各方面加强了经营管理，具体解决了如何安排劳力，实行了五定包工的定额管理方法，贯彻生产责任制。对分配问题和评级问题，公社党委会也做了一些典型调查，发现有些社员，如手工业者、饲养员和人少劳力强的在实行供给制后减少了收入，经研究准备采取技术补贴、超产奖励和适当调整级别的办法，待社员代表会讨论通过后执行。耕牛饲养和农具保管问题，也初步确定实行“六定”（耕牛定人、定头数、定饲料、定膘、定繁殖、定奖惩），“三包”（农具保管包到户、包件数、包奖惩）的办法。其他尚待研究的问题，公社党委会也决定分别向社员作出交代，以作到件件有答复，事事有着落。
    经过这样大整大改以后，社员们情绪很高，如社员傅云昌看到他6日提的意见，社里在7日就给他解决了房子问题后，当天就又提了三条意见。新光大队经过鸣放、整改，劳动出勤率由80％上升到100％，锄草工效由每人每天一亩，提高到一亩五分。
    现在，张集公社正在深入鸣放的基础上，进入了大整大改的高潮。
