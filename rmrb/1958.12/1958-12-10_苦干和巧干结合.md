Combining Hard Work and Ingenuity

During the Great Leap Forward, the way we work after boosting our morale is very important. If we work effectively, we can achieve twice the results with half the effort; if we work ineffectively, we will get half the results with twice the effort. So, what is the best way to work? Experience from all fronts has proven that combining hard work and ingenuity is an important method.

Hard work is a slogan that has long been deeply rooted in people's hearts. Leading organizations are accustomed to mobilizing the masses to work hard when assigning shock tasks; when checking whether the enthusiasm is sufficient and whether the masses are fully mobilized, they generally look at the degree of hard work. However, ingenuity has not received enough attention in many places. Ingenuity means technical revolution. If you only know hard work and do not know ingenuity, you can naturally achieve great results, but if you combine hard work and ingenuity and engage in technical revolution, you can not only achieve greater results, but also reduce labor intensity and shorten labor time, truly achieving twice the results with half the effort.

The news in today's newspaper about the railway workers in Tangshan Station and other places creating high platform and low cargo position loading and unloading methods is a good example of ingenuity. Anyone familiar with the railway situation knows that being a loading and unloading worker is not easy. Railway freight cars, whether open cars or boxcars, are high above the ground, requiring the construction of ramps and the use of carrying, picking, and lifting methods to load goods from bottom to top into the cars, which is quite laborious and inefficient. Unloading is naturally less labor-intensive, but because the yards of general stations are very narrow and the cargo positions are small, it is often impossible to unload, which also affects the turnover of vehicles. The high platform and low cargo position loading and unloading method changes the old outlook. This new loading and unloading method uses the principle of "water flows to lower places" to build high loading platforms (or lower the tracks) and dig low unloading cargo positions (or raise the tracks), so that bulk goods such as coal, iron, ore, logs, sand, and stone can be loaded and unloaded from high to low, greatly reducing labor intensity and increasing efficiency by one to eight times. Moreover, the high platform and low cargo position loading and unloading method is very easy to implement. Building high platforms and digging low cargo positions only require some earthwork; if the masses are mobilized to use local materials, without even a penny of state investment, they can be built and used in a short period of time. Such a simple, easy-to-implement, and effective advanced experience is extremely ingenious, and its significance should not be underestimated in the slightest.

Everyone knows that loading and unloading work is an important part of railway transportation work. The length of loading and unloading time is one of the deciding factors in the speed of vehicle turnover. Since the Great Leap Forward, more than 80,000 loading and unloading workers across the country have worked hard day and night to load and unload quickly, making their best efforts, but due to the rapid development of the Great Leap Forward and the doubling of transportation tasks, serious backlog phenomena have still been created, affecting the inability of vehicles to turn over faster. Later, various localities implemented the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, and learned from the experience of Changzhou City's "Ants Moving Mount Tai" and the experience of the Guanting Township People's Commune in establishing a transportation army that was both workers and farmers, so that in addition to the 80,000 regular troops on the railway loading and unloading front, there were also a large number of standby forces and shock brigades, totaling no less than 1.2 million people. The shift from 80,000 people working hard to more than 1 million people working hard played a great role in attacking the backlog of materials and striving for smooth transportation. At present, the railway loading and unloading front is still known as "three echelons and a million-strong army," but the real force that can be dispatched is only 200,000 to 300,000 people. This is because the tasks of steelmaking, deep plowing, and water conservancy construction in various places are very heavy, and the labor force is very tight, so it is impossible to regularly mobilize a million-strong army for the railway loading and unloading departments; it is also very difficult to rely on these 200,000 to 300,000 people to work hard to complete the increasing railway loading and unloading tasks. This requires finding a way to work ingeniously in addition to hard work, and the high platform and low cargo position loading and unloading method is an ingenious way. This loading and unloading method is most suitable for bulk goods such as coal and iron, and bulk goods account for about 80% of the current national railway freight volume. This means that if all railway stations across the country build high platforms and dig low cargo positions, then the loading and unloading efficiency of 80% of the goods can be increased by one to eight times. Just imagine: without spending much money, without increasing manpower, and being able to increase the loading and unloading efficiency of 80% of the goods by one to eight times in a short period of time, how great are the benefits of ingenious work!

The transition from hard work to feeling that "hard work is not enough, ingenuity is also needed" is also a universal law of the development of mass movements. After the masses are mobilized, their enthusiasm always comes first, and they are willing to work hard day and night; later, they feel that hard work alone is not enough, and that ingenuity is also needed, and that efficiency should be improved from the development of technical revolution. The high platform and low cargo position loading and unloading method is a product of the development of the mass movement. Similar simple, easy-to-implement, and effective technical revolutions are also common in other industries. Comrades who do leadership work must master the development law of mass movements, summarize and promote the inventions and creations of the masses, especially those key technical revolution measures, and guide the masses to combine hard work and ingenuity. Unfortunately, some of our comrades are often easily satisfied with hard work and do not pay much attention to guiding the masses to work ingeniously. They think that as long as politics is in command and as long as they work hard, that is enough; they think that ingenuity is just a technical problem and has no decisive consciousness. In fact, this idea is wrong. Politics in command is of course the most important, and without this prerequisite, nothing can be discussed; however, under the prerequisite of politics in command, technology still has a decisive meaning. It is impossible to improve if technical problems are put aside.

Now, all localities are paying attention to adjusting the rhythm of production, combining hard work and rest, and taking many measures to allow the masses to eat well and sleep well. However, some comrades also feel that hard work and rest cannot be combined. They believe that if they want to ensure eight hours of sleep, they will not be able to complete the task; if they want to ensure the completion of the task, they will not be able to get eight hours of sleep. Here, on the one hand, there is a problem with the thinking of these comrades. They completely oppose completing the task and resting, and do not know that resting is precisely for completing the task, that without appropriate rest, the task cannot be better completed, and that caring about the lives of the masses is something we must never forget; but on the other hand, it also reflects that the work of these comrades is not effective, they have only found the way of hard work, and have not yet found the way of ingenious work, so there is no way to combine hard work and rest. This requires helping them to find a way to work ingeniously. Only by combining hard work and ingenuity can we better combine hard work and rest.

The great year of 1958 is coming to an end, and 1959 is approaching in an instant. 1959 is a decisive year in the three years of hard work. Naturally, it is a year that requires more hard work, and it is also inevitably a year that requires more ingenuity, and a year that requires a good combination of hard work and ingenuity. Looking back on the Great Leap Forward, in the mass production movement, the sparks of technical revolution are flashing all over the sky. Summarizing these new creations and new achievements, and promoting them, so that the millions of labor army can get new weapons, will surely be able to better meet the more great tasks of 1959.

### 苦干和巧干结合

    苦干和巧干结合
    在大跃进中，鼓足干劲之后，怎样干，关系很大。干得得法，事半功倍；干得不得法，事倍功半。究竟怎样干才比较好呢？各个战线上的经验都证明，把苦干和巧干结合起来，是一个重要的方法。
    苦干，这是早已深入人心的口号了。领导机关布置突击任务，都习惯于发动群众大干苦干；检查干劲足不足，群众发动充分不充分，一般也都看苦干的程度如何。但，巧干，在不少地方却是还没有引起足够重视的。巧干者，技术革命也。只知苦干，不知巧干，自然也可以得到很大的成绩，如把苦干和巧干结合起来，大闹技术革命，不只可以取得更大的成绩，而且还可以减轻劳动强度和缩短劳动时间，真正作到事半功倍。
    今天本报发表的唐山车站等地铁路职工创造高站台、低货位装卸方法的新闻，就是巧干的一个好例子。熟悉铁路情况的人都知道，装卸工不好当。铁路货车，不论是敞车的车帮或棚车的车门，都高出地面之上，需要架设跳板，用扛、挑、抬等办法由下往上把货物装进车厢，费力不小，效率极低，遇到风雨天还容易发生工伤事故。卸车，固然比较省力，但由于一般车站场地都很狭，货位小，常常卸不开，也影响车辆的周转。高站台、低货位的装卸方法一改旧观。这种新的装卸方法利用“水往低处流”的道理，把装车站台筑高（或把线路铺低），把卸车货位挖低（或把线路垫高），使煤、铁、矿石、原木、沙、石等散装货物，都可以由高处往低处装卸，大大减轻了劳动强度，提高效率一倍至八倍。而且，高站台、低货位的装卸方法推行起来也极简便。筑高站台、挖低货位，都只有一些土方工程；如果发动群众，就地取材，甚至不用国家一文投资，就可以在短期内建成使用。像这样简便易行，效果显著的先进经验，真是巧妙极了，对它的意义，丝毫也不能低估。
    大家都知道，装卸工作是铁路运输工作的一个重要组成部分。装卸作业时间的长短，是车辆周转快慢的决定因素之一。大跃进以来，全国铁路八万多装卸工昼夜苦干，快装快卸，尽了最大的努力，但由于跃进形势一日千里，运输任务倍增，还是造成了严重的积压现象，影响了车辆不能更快的周转。后来，各地贯彻全党全民办运输的方针，学习了常州市“蚂蚁搬泰山”的经验和官亭乡人民公社成立亦工亦农的运输大军的经验，使铁路装卸战线上除了八万正规军以外，又多了大批常备军和突击队，总数不下一百二十万人。由八万人苦干，到一百多万人苦干，这对于突击积压物资，力争运输畅通起了很大的作用。目前铁路装卸战线虽然还号称“三个梯队、百万大军”，但真能出动的力量只二、三十万人。这是因为各地炼钢、深翻地和修水利等任务都很繁重，劳动力很紧张，不可能经常给铁路装卸部门调集百万大军；靠这二、三十万人苦干，来完成日益增长的铁路装卸任务，也是很困难的。这就需要除了苦干之外，再找巧干的道路，高站台、低货位的装卸方法，就是一条巧干的道路。这种装卸方法最适用于煤、铁等散装货物，而散装货物在目前全国铁路货运量中占80％左右。这就是说，如果全国铁路车站都筑高站台、挖低货位，那么，就有80％的货物，装卸效率能提高一倍至八倍。试想：花钱不多，人力不增，短期内就能使80％的货物装卸效率提高一倍至八倍，巧干的好处多么大！
    由苦干到感到“苦干不足，还需巧干”，也是群众运动发展的普遍规律。群众发动起来以后，总是干劲先上来，昼夜苦干，在所不辞；到后来就感到只是苦干还不够，还要巧干，要从开展技术革命方面来提高效率。高站台、低货位的装卸方法，就是群众运动发展的产物。类似这种简单易行、效果显著的技术革命，在其他行业中也有不少。做领导工作的同志，一定要掌握群众运动的发展规律，总结和推广群众的发明创造，特别是那些关键性的技术革命措施，引导群众把苦干和巧干结合起来。可惜，我们有些同志常常容易满足于苦干，而不大注意引导群众去巧干，他们以为只要政治挂帅，只要苦干就行了；他们认为巧干，不过是个技术问题，是没有决定意识的。其实，这种想法是不对的。政治挂帅，当然是最重要的，没有这个前提，一切都谈不到；但是，在政治挂帅的前提下，技术还是有决定意义的。把技术问题丢在一旁，是不可能提高的。
    现在，各地都注意了调整生产的节奏，把苦战和休整结合起来，采取许多措施让群众吃好、睡好。但是，也有些同志感到苦战和休整是无法结合的，他们认为要保证睡足八小时，就没法完成任务；要保证完成任务，就没法睡足八小时。这里，一方面是这些同志思想上有问题，他们把完成任务和休整完全对立起来，不知道休整正是为了完成任务，没有适当的休整就不能更好地完成任务，不知道关心群众生活是我们一刻也不能忘怀的事情；但另一方面，也反映了这些同志的工作还不得法，他们只找到了苦干这条路，还没有找到巧干这条路，因而没有办法把苦战和休整结合起来。这就需要帮助他们去找巧干的办法。只有把苦干和巧干结合起来，才能更好地把苦战和休整结合起来。
    伟大的1958年快要过去了，1959年瞬息即至。1959年是苦战三年中具有决定意义的一年，自然是更需要苦战的一年，同时也必然是更需要巧干的一年，更需要把苦干和巧干很好结合的一年。回顾大跃进以来，在群众性的生产运动中，技术革命的火花满空闪烁，总结这些新的创造，新的成就，推而广之，使千百万劳动大军得到新的武器，必能更好地迎接1959年更伟大的任务。
