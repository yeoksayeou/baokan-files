    Quickly Manage Rapeseed Fields Well
    Rapeseed is one of the main oil crops in our country, accounting for a large proportion of oil production. The planting area of rapeseed over the years accounts for more than 30% of the total area of all oil crops (excluding soybeans). Actively increasing rapeseed production is of extremely important significance for improving people's lives.
    The experience of high rapeseed yields in various places during this year's summer harvest proves that to increase rapeseed production, one must successfully navigate the three stages of "planting, managing, and harvesting." Regarding this year's winter-sown rapeseed, the good aspects are: the quality of sowing is generally better than last year, with deeper plowing, more fertilization, and denser planting; the area of improved varieties and seedling transplantation has also been greatly expanded. However, we must also see the other side: first, the rapeseed sowing period this year was very long, with the early sowing taking place before the Cold Dew and the late sowing only recently completed; late-sown seedlings will be tender and weak in the future, making them vulnerable to cold and frost; second, in many areas, rapeseed fields have not been plowed deeply enough, fertilizer has not been applied evenly, planting density is uneven, and seedlings are not growing strongly; third, some areas have been threatened by drought and pests, resulting in low emergence rates and a considerable number of missing seedlings. From these situations, it is clear that the "planting well" stage has not been fully achieved this winter. Therefore, we must pay more attention to grasping the field management stage and take effective measures to make up for the shortcomings of the sowing work.
    Many large-scale high-yield rapeseed fields appeared during this year's summer harvest, and the yields of these fields were several times higher than the local average yield. This fact shows that the potential for increasing rapeseed production is great. However, to unleash the potential for increasing rapeseed production and promote a great leap forward in production, we must have leap-forward measures and greater enthusiasm to guarantee it. And all good measures can only be realized through field management. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out a vigorous campaign in rapeseed field management.
    The current rapeseed field management should focus on cultivating strong seedlings and preventing frost to protect seedlings, actively doing the following three tasks: First, check and replant seedlings, fight drought and control pests, and ensure full stands. After rapeseed is sown, if drought or pests cause missing seedlings, in addition to "treating pests when they appear and watering when there is a lack of water," we must also combine thinning work to thin dense areas and replant sparse areas (or fill gaps), strengthen cultivation, and achieve full stands in every plot and strong plants in every stand. Second, apply top dressing fertilizer in stages and supplement fertilizer according to seedling conditions. Generally, rapeseed requires four top dressings: seedling-promoting fertilizer, seedling-strengthening fertilizer, heat-preserving fertilizer, and initial flowering fertilizer; if rapeseed seedlings are found to be yellow, red, or growing weakly, additional fertilizer should be applied separately. Third, clear ditches, accumulate grass, and prevent frost to protect seedlings. In order to ensure that all rapeseed seedlings survive the winter, we must do a good job in clearing ditches to drain waterlogged areas, and also accumulate more rice straw, cotton stalks, or corn stalks, etc., to weave windbreaks or pile them crisscross in the furrow ditches to resist cold wind. In addition, combined with intertillage and fertilization, soil from the furrows, river mud, and ash manure can also be used to preserve heat and prevent frost.
    Putting politics in command and strengthening leadership are guarantees for doing a good job in rapeseed field management. People's communes in various places should use the methods of vigorous airing of views and debates to make cadres and the masses realize the important significance of managing rapeseed well; they should uniformly arrange labor, conscientiously divide battle lines, assign responsibilities, and establish specialized field management teams to ensure that rapeseed fields are managed by dedicated personnel. At present, it is necessary to quickly carry out inspections and appraisals, and set off a high tide of rapeseed field management, so that no third-class seedlings survive the winter, and strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest next year.

### 快把油菜田管理好

    快把油菜田管理好
    油菜是我国食油的主要油料之一，它在油料生产中占的比重很大，历年油菜的种植面积占全部油料（不包括大豆）总面积的30％以上。积极增产油菜，对改善人民生活有极其重要的意义。
    今年夏收中，各地油菜丰产经验证明，要油菜增产必须过好“种、管、收”三关。今年冬种的油菜，好的方面是：播种质量一般比去年有所提高，耕的深、施肥多、种的密，良种和育苗移栽的面积也扩大了很多。但是也要看到另一方面：第一，今年油菜播种期拖得很长，早的在寒露前就播种，迟的最近才种下；迟种的将来幼苗嫩弱，不易抗御寒冻；第二，有不少地区的油菜田，还耕的不深，施肥不匀，种得稀密不均，幼苗生育不壮；第三，部分地区受到旱、虫威胁，出苗率低，缺苗现象相当严重。从这些情况看来，“种好”这一关，今冬并没有全部过好。因此，必须更加注意抓紧田间管理关，并且要采取有效措施，来弥补播种工作的不足。
  今年夏收中出现了很多油菜大面积丰产，这些丰产田的产量都高出当地一般产量的几倍，这个事实说明油菜的增产潜力很大。但是要发挥油菜的增产潜力，促进生产大跃进，必须有跃进的措施和更大的干劲来保证。而一切好的措施都只有通过田间管理来实现。因此在油菜田间管理上大干一场，是十分必要的。
    当前油菜的田间管理，应以培育壮苗、防冻保苗为中心，积极做好以下三项工作：一是查苗补苗，抗旱治虫，保证全苗。油菜播种以后，遇到旱、虫危害发生缺苗现象，除做到“有虫就治，缺水就浇”以外，还要结合间苗工作，进行间密补稀（或补缺），加强培育，达到丘丘全苗，株株健壮。二是分期追肥，看苗补肥。一般要求对油菜进行四次追肥，即施提苗肥，壮苗肥，保温肥和初花肥；若发现菜苗发黄发红或生长不壮时，还要分别补施肥料。三是清沟、积草，防冻保苗。为了使油菜全苗过冬，要做好清沟排渍工作，还要多积稻草、棉秸或玉米秆等，编防风障或交叉堆在畦沟内，抵御寒风侵袭。此外，结合中耕、施肥，还可用培沟土、壅河泥及盖灰粪等办法保温防冻。
    政治挂帅，加强领导，是做好油菜田间管理的保证。各地人民公社应该通过大鸣大放，使干部和群众认识管好油菜的重要意义；要统一安排劳力，切实做到划分战线，分工负责，建立田间管理专业队，保证油菜田有专人负责管理。目前要迅速开展检查评比，掀起一个油菜田间管理高潮，不使三类苗过冬，力争明年油菜大丰收。
