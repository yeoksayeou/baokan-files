　　Great Potential
　　By a People's Daily Commentator

　　Developing fishery production is an important component of the diversified rural economy. In the South, fish and rice have always been the people's two major sources of income. Thanks to the great development of water conservancy projects, many places in the North have also started fish farming. With the great leap forward in agricultural production, fishery production has also seen significant development this year. It is estimated that the total national aquatic product output this year may reach more than 8 million tons, an increase of more than 150% compared to 3.1 million tons last year.

　　However, this is still far from adequate compared to the abundant resources we possess. Only one-third of China's freshwater and seawater areas suitable for aquaculture are currently being used, leaving two-thirds urgently awaiting utilization. Even within those utilized water areas, there is still great potential to be tapped, and the yield per unit area in many places can still be significantly improved.

　　How can we further develop China's aquatic industry? Based on the experience of this year's great development in aquatic production and China's specific circumstances, we must continue to implement the policy of mobilizing the masses, focusing on aquaculture, and combining fishing with aquaculture in the aquatic industry. In the past, there was a debate in the aquatic sector about whether to prioritize aquaculture or fishing in developing China's aquatic industry. During the rectification campaign, this issue was resolved, and everyone unanimously agreed that we should widely mobilize the masses and adopt a method that focuses on aquaculture and combines fishing with aquaculture. Especially after a year of practice, it has become even more evident that this approach is correct. In areas where the freshwater and seawater surfaces suitable for fish farming have not yet been fully utilized, we should actively and gradually utilize them. In areas where aquaculture has already been developed, we should further improve technology, apply existing high-yield experiences, implement dense stocking and mixed farming, and carry out large-scale high-yield production. If 10% of the existing 30 million mu of small and medium-sized freshwater surfaces and 10 million mu of cultivatable seawater surfaces can achieve high yields, with an annual output of 10,000 jin per mu, we can obtain 25 million tons of aquatic products. In this way, the national average can be 75 jin of aquatic products per person per year.

　　To develop aquaculture, the most important aspect currently is to solve the problem of fish fry and fingerlings. Whether developing and utilizing new cultivatable water surfaces or improving production on the existing basis, we must first have a large number of seedlings. To solve the seedling problem, the most important thing is to rely on the masses, take action, and adopt various methods: collecting seedlings, breeding, artificial incubation, or transplanting fish and shrimp from seawater to freshwater for aquaculture. To achieve these goals, we must oppose the dependency and waiting mentality among some cadres and the masses. Although external support and long-distance transportation can solve part of the problem, the main thing is to rely on our own efforts and solve it locally. This year, many places have solved the difficulty of fish fry and achieved high yields by mobilizing the masses and adopting the method of "collecting seedlings locally, breeding locally, and stocking locally." Conversely, some places emphasize the difficulty of fish fry and do not take action to solve it themselves, so the aquaculture plan has not been well completed.

　　To develop the aquatic industry, we should also do a good job in the acquisition and transportation of aquatic products, so that production and sales supply can be well integrated. Otherwise, there will be a situation where there are many fish in the water, but fish cannot be bought in the market. This will not only affect the improvement of the living standards of urban and rural people but also affect the development of the aquatic industry. The solution to this problem is, on the one hand, for the local leadership departments to organize a certain amount of manpower to carry out surprise fishing and surprise transportation, so that production and supply departments can be linked up; on the other hand, commercial departments also need to organize surprise purchases, and transportation departments should organize forces to provide necessary support. This will not only support aquatic production but also meet market needs.

    发展渔业生产，是农村发展多种经济的一个重要组成部分。在南方，鱼和米从来就是人民的两大收入。由于水利建设的大发展，北方有许多地方也开始养鱼。随着农业生产的大跃进，今年的渔业生产也有很大的发展。据估计：今年全国水产的总产量可达到八百多万吨，较去年的三百一十万吨增加一倍半以上。
    但是，这同我们所拥有的丰富资源比较起来，还是十分不足的。我国淡水和海水可养面积，已经使用的不过三分之一，还有三分之二的面积急待利用。就是在那些已经利用的水域内，也还有很大的潜力可以挖掘，许多地方的单位面积产量也还可以大大提高。
    如何进一步发展我国的水产事业呢？根据今年水产大发展的经验和我国的具体情况，就是要在水产事业上继续贯彻发动群众，开展以养为主、捕捞与养殖相结合的方针。过去，在水产部门对发展我国的水产事业曾经有过以养为主还是以捕捞为主的争论。在整风运动中，这个问题解决了，大家一致认为应该广泛地发动群众，采取以养为主、捕捞与养殖相结合的方法。特别是经过一年来的实践，更加充分证明这种作法是正确的。今后在还没有充分利用淡水和海水面养鱼的地区，应该积极地逐步地利用起来。在已经开展了水产养殖渔业的地区，应该进一步提高技术，运用已有的丰产经验，实行密放混养，开展大面积的高额丰产。如果能在现有的三千多万亩中、小型淡水水面和一千多万亩可养的海水水面中，有10％的面积作到高产，每亩年产量达到万斤，就可以获得二千五百万吨的水产品。这样，平均全国每人每年可以有七十五斤水产品。
    要发展水产养殖，当前最重要的一环是解决鱼苗鱼种问题。不论开发利用新的可养水面，或在原有的基础上提高产量，首先必须有大量的种苗。解决种苗问题，最主要的还是要依靠群众，大家动手，采取多种多样的办法：采苗，育种、人工孵化，或者是把海水中的鱼、虾，移在淡水中养殖。要做到这些，就要反对现在少教干部和群众中的依赖和等待思想。外地支援和长途运输固然可以解决部分问题，但主要的还是要靠自己动手，就地解决。今年很多地方，由于发动群众，采取“就地采苗，就地育种，就地放养”的办法，解决了鱼种的困难，获得了丰产。相反的，有的地方强调鱼种困难，自己不动手解决，水产的养殖计划就未能很好地完成。
    要发展水产事业，当前还应该作好水产品的收购和调运工作，使生产和销售供应很好地结合起来。不然，就会造成水里养的鱼很多，但是市场买不到鱼。这样不但影响城乡人民生活的改善，而且影响水产事业的发展。解决这个问题的办法，一方面要由当地领导部门组织一定的人力，突击捕捞，突击运输，使生产和供应部门挂起钩来；另一方面，商业部门也需要组织突击收购，运输部门组织力量作必要的支援，这样既支持了水产生产，又满足了市场需要。
