People with Blue Skies Overhead and Feet on the Ocean
——Sketches from the Fujian Front, Part Three
Liu Baiyu

    I am now at an artillery position on the Fujian front. Here, I can hear the sound of cannons like a storm, and I can see the black clouds thrown up by the shells and the flashing fire in the smoke. I am sitting opposite a young soldier, his jaw slightly raised, his eyes so gentle and solemn. He said, "People are launching 'satellites' in production repeatedly. If we don't fight well at the front, how can we be worthy of them..." At this moment, I cannot help but think of all the people on the construction front. When you are in the fire of steelmaking or on the construction site of that turbulent river, under the red flag in the fields or on the highest peaks exploring treasures, in short, when you lay a cornerstone or gain an achievement for our beautiful life, have you ever looked towards the southeast of the motherland? At that time, did you all think of your brothers on the Fujian coastal defense front? I believe I will get such a definite answer. Yes, the front and the rear are so closely intertwined and integrated. Every leap forward in construction illuminates the hearts of the soldiers. Whether it is the dawn or the midnight stars, especially when the wind blows from the distant mainland, how excited and solemn the soldiers at the front are, feeling the encouragement of the entire motherland! Thus, the promise made by this young soldier just now becomes a huge action, people throw themselves into fierce battles again and again, and people create brilliant achievements with the flames of their lives again and again.

    As I walked along the communication trench, I was attracted by the poetry leaflets written on red and green paper. I especially copied the following lines:

    With blue skies overhead and feet on the ocean,
    Defending the gate of the motherland.

    I turned around, and a group of young people appeared around the cannon. Some wore faded military caps, some were bareheaded, some had goggles hanging on their foreheads, some wore blue navy uniforms, and some wore only a white shirt. They were all smiling.

    But I am among extraordinary people! I told myself softly in my heart. While still in Xiamen, I heard people tell me: "Heroic, tenacious, and resolute are the characteristics of the coastal artillery. The fighting on the Weitou front was the most difficult and the most outstanding. The first shots of two companies were rated as heroic cannons."

    Let's take a look at our heroic cannon first! The huge gun mount is like a mechanical iron mountain, and the thick, long gun barrel extends out with a stern muzzle. I visited the people's first artillery regiment in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. Later, in the snowy fields of the Songhua River, I saw horse-drawn gun carriages covered in white cloth snow suits for the first time, heading to the front with us. At that time, the soldiers laughed from the bottom of their hearts, clapping their hands and shouting, "Look! The big guy is going into battle!" On the Korean front, we appreciated the symphony of our artillery fire. But this was the first time I met such a "god among cannons." Its muzzle faces the ocean, facing Jinmen Island. It was they who first issued a loud roar in the tense situation of August.

    Listen to the cheerful outpouring of the commanders and fighters on the front line!

    "Once, the air force was dispatched and flew low over the sea in front of us."

    "That's right, later a fierce battle unfolded in the sea and air, and our little silver swallows suddenly threw two enemy planes into the seabed."

    "Another time, we were firing cannons below, and the planes were protecting us above. The soldiers looked up at the white lines on the tails of the planes and said it was a warning to Eisenhower."

    "Let me tell you, it was really beautiful at that time! At night, searchlights illuminated the sea in all directions. We sealed it off tightly. Not to mention small sampans could not sneak onto Jinmen Island, even a seabird could not escape our eyes."

    At that time, in that hot August, that August that had just blown through typhoons and heavy rain, Dulles ignited the flames of invading the Arab people in the Middle East and also stirred up a wave of provocation against China in the Taiwan Strait. Is it tolerable, which is intolerable? So we launched a punitive artillery attack on the sea. The artillery fire was fierce. A while ago, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was still bluffing and bragging in the broadcasting tubes on the front line: "Aren't you ready? If you are ready, why don't you fight? If you fire one cannon, we will fire one cannon..." Now, in a burst of artillery fire, they panicked and shouted: "It's raining! It's raining!" So, let's take a look at the fighters in our artillery positions! ——They are all wearing vests with blue wave patterns, their bare arms shining with warm and moist light. The shells explode so fiercely, igniting bursts of black smoke, the gas stings the throat, dust fills the space, the position is as hot as fire, and the ground underfoot is muddy with oil and water. But the cannon is jumping and shooting rapidly. The most fierce burst fired one shot every seven seconds. The cannon barrel is red-hot. When the charge is loaded, there is no need to pull the cannon, the shell flies out by itself. The time has come for the powerful sound of the people's cannons to draw conclusions for history. In the "dark East" - aiming the muzzle at the brains of Asia and Africa, you can arbitrarily extract wealth and blood, that colonial "golden age" has been turned over along with a long-withered page of history. In a burst of artillery fire, a "US" transport ship anchored in Liaoluo Bay exploded. Suddenly, a plume of black smoke soared into the sky, like a black umbrella slowly unfolding. The smoke and fire burned for a whole day...

    The excellent artillery commander Song Siqian, under the light of the electric lamp in his company headquarters' tunnel, after a moment of contemplation, said to me:

    "The key issue is time! The enemy's warships pass in front of our artillery fire's firing range in × minutes. That day, we fired eighty shells together in × minutes and hit the enemy ship. Since then, their fleet has never dared to swagger in front of our artillery fire again."

    Of course, I know that the key to deciding the time lies in people. Fourth gunner Wan Deheng told me: "All of our dozen or so soldiers are conscripts, the youngest is only nineteen years old." That is to say, they were only ten years old when the motherland was liberated. They are the first generation of new people who grew up under the socialist sunshine. Just as aimer An Yemin wrote in his letter of determination, their hearts were illuminated by the brilliance of Liu Hulan, Huang Jiguang, and Qiu Shaoyun from childhood. A political commissar of an artillery unit said to me: "Do you remember! In the past, there were some soldiers who were very brave on the front line, but they were usually sloppy. It's not like that now. You go and see, they are so pure and lovely, even a little shy in front of you, but they are so brave when they act. You point to where and they will hit where!" Of course, this is the most affectionate praise from a senior political cadre for his soldiers. If you listen to how a gunner talks about his comrades in arms again! "He is not afraid of war at all, but he is conscientious and never forgets in his heart that he is afraid of not firing the cannon well. In the week before the war, he was constantly wiping the aiming machine, wiping the shells..."

    Now, I don't intend to narrate their heroic and magical stories in battle. However, through that thick smoke of gunpowder, we cannot help but see a spirit, which is as dazzling as a red flag and as bright as the morning light. The artillery fire is flying and roaring day and night. If you walk all over the front-line positions, you will not only see the greatness of our heroic cannons, but also the mottled battle scars on the cannons. At that time, a kind of awe-inspiring sense of heroism cannot help but penetrate into your heart. But one point is clearly above all else; that is, no matter how fierce the artillery fire, our people are even fiercer than the artillery fire.

    Now, let's get to know this group of young gunners who fly like eagles in our clear sky!

    This is gunner Wan Deheng, you see his eyebrows are high, his eyes are calm, from his chest, which is blackened by the sea breeze, reveals a blue striped navy shirt, his belt ring is carved with a golden sea anchor, but no matter how solid his shoulders are, a kind of youthful and pure smile constantly flashes. In the midst of a fierce artillery battle, a large shell was loaded into the cannon, and when it was fired, it didn't go off. What to do!? The people around the cannon looked at each other, their eyes widened. The situation is critical! If you pull the bolt, maybe the shell will explode at that moment, if you wait five minutes before touching it, but you calculate, one shot every seven seconds, five minutes is dozens of shots, what to do!? At this moment, the young gunner Wan Deheng issued an order to the comrades around him: "Scatter quickly!" He himself rushed up, pulled the breech open, hugged the charge tightly with both hands, and rushed out. This cannon continued to roar together with the entire artillery group. Is there only one Wan Deheng? No, in another coastal artillery company there is a ammunition handler named Zhang Shifa, he also encountered the same difficult situation. He also immediately pulled the shell out of the cannon chamber without hesitation, but the shell was already scorching hot and might suddenly explode. The comrades in the position watched him run out like a gust of wind. Just at this time, there was a loud roar outside, and everyone thought he had exploded with the shell, but he shrugged and jumped back. It turned out that an enemy shell had just landed. On the front line, through that stormy night and clear morning, people live and fight like flames, with a noble spirit of selflessness. A person, if he does not have this spirit here, he will be ashamed and unable to live. Gunner Yin Daan is the most simple, honest, and silent one among this group of young people. During the time we spent together, he didn't say a word about himself. He only talked about others. This is not accidental humility. In the midst of such a fierce artillery battle, he also forgot himself. Suddenly a shell fell, and he immediately pounced on the battalion commander who was on the phone, using his body to block the flying shrapnel; but when he himself felt a heat on his leg, fearing that it would affect the fighting mood of his comrades, he quietly pulled up the rolled-up trouser leg towards his foot, but one of his feet was soon dyed red with blood. Similarly, we can also find another gunner, Zhang Zuowu, who rushed into the flames to rescue his comrades in arms, but was burned and fainted. When his comrades rescued him, the telephone headset was still tightly on his ears. He said, "I can still hear the orders! I can still command the battle!" That night, he tossed and turned in the hospital and couldn't sleep. He was only worried that his cannon wouldn't be able to fire well if he wasn't in position. Of course, sometimes he also criticized himself in his heart, the comrades will definitely do well, and finally he still said: "I want to go back, I can't command myself, I also want to see my comrades fight with my own eyes!" I saw the radiant loader Guan Cichong, he has a well-proportioned and slender figure, but if you look at his hands, you will say that this is a born loader, it is a big hand that can throw a sixty-pound cannon shell like a ball. "The key issue is time!" It was he who stood on the high gun mount, loaded more than three hundred shells in one breath, hot, tense, he fell on the cannon and fainted, people carried him down, he woke up, poured some cold water on his head, and climbed back to the gun mount. Similarly, on the brother cannon position next to him, the artillery battle was also carried out at a speed of one shot every seven seconds, the ammunition handler carried shells from the ammunition depot and ran flying, he fainted in the trench, and was awakened again by the blast of the shell explosion, he crawled by himself, crawled to the water bottle to take cold water to wet himself, and stood up and ran up, he fainted like this three times, and stood up three times. ...

    Am I just here to talk about the experiences of every fighter? No, I think the reader can fully understand this. However, for the sake of objectivity, I would like to ask some Western people to measure the results of our battle! This Edwards is a reporter for the Associated Press, he said: "A supply ship was directly hit by two shells and was destroyed, the sound was deafening." His companion Carey described it more vividly: "This ship is slowly moving. Shells are falling everywhere. Hiss, hiss, hiss, the increasingly fierce firepower made the people on the ship, except for those who wanted to drive the ship away from the beach, crawl on the deck. A cannon shell exploded violently near the port side. Smoke went straight to the deck. Someone shouted: 'Fire, fire!'" And a British reporter "who cannot publish his name" swore here, he said: "This is a completely saturated bombardment. In an instant, the air was densely covered with shells and shrapnel, falling on the beach and the sea. ...The shells were roaring, whistling, booming - making all kinds of nasty sounds. We immediately fled that hellish place." He said: "We will never, ever go there again." But it is precisely these people in our artillery positions who dare to overcome difficulties and obstacles who beat the loudest drums of the march, and this drumming is urging the final sinking of the sun at six o'clock in the afternoon. And what follows will be a free spring.

    The dust of war does not seem to be able to stain the sky and the ocean. Looking out from the muzzle of the artillery position is the sea. The color of the sea at dawn is as blue and transparent as琉璃, but the dusk reflects the sea water like a piece of red rouge. Once night falls, if it is not the moonlight covering ten thousand acres, it is the stars hanging low on the sea, like thousands of lights. People should not think of the front line as a "terror"! Ostrovsky said it well: "When we are galloping on the front line and experiencing the storms of battle, do you think the sun does not shine on us or life is not beautiful?" People love their glorious fighting posts, turning the position into a "garden" and a "most beloved home". Let me give an example: telephone operator Zheng Changjian, his belief is: "The observation post is the eyes of the artillery", in order to protect it, he crawled in the artillery fire to connect the line. His left arm was blown off, so he tied his arm with a section of wire and continued to crawl forward. Later, he was about to transfer from the position treatment center to the rear hospital, but his only emotional attachment was his "home". No matter what, he returned to the artillery position and stayed for a few more days before saying goodbye and leaving. Here, let us carefully appreciate the hearts of the soldiers! In an artillery position, the soldiers are posting their own brightly colored drawings, one painting is a sketch of their artillery battle, one painting is a people's commune with steel flames soaring and food all over the land, and the most interesting thing is that they carved a couplet on a wooden board and hung it on the door: "The motherland's socialist construction is like a骏马 advancing a thousand miles a day", "The soldier's heart of loving the motherland is like a flame that is hot and high ten thousand feet", they planted wild agave on the edge of the trenches, and the skillful artists made reliefs of flying doves of peace on the artillery fortifications. A soldier is mending shoes for his comrades in the sunlight at the entrance of the tunnel, another group of soldiers are busy printing their company's poetry journal "万诗集" on a mimeograph machine, a red scarf sent from the distant rear is hanging on the gun position, and a photo of the night view of Tiananmen Square with ten thousand stars and lights is displayed under the glass of the desk in the company headquarters. The soldiers installed battery lights on the bed frame. Under the faint blue light, we can see eyes concentrating on reading books, and we can hear the loud sound of the accordion.

    But when the battle alarm resounds over the position, people quickly throw themselves into battle. People here fight and win against difficulties and obstacles, and they can also make truly proud laughter.

    On the morning of October 20, the US fleet violated the order of our Ministry of National Defense and conducted escorting at sea again. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the radio in front of the front-line positions was crowded with people, all listening intently to Minister Peng Dehuai's order to "resume shelling as a punishment." It was at that time that Dulles was flying to Taiwan. When our soldiers stood up and walked to the gun positions, we heard such talking and laughing:

    "Okay, Dulles has worked so hard to come to Taiwan from so far away, we have to give him a gift!"

    "You're right, then let our shells participate in the meeting between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek!"

    Please don't think that this is just the talk and laughter of two ordinary young people on the Fujian front! It was this pleasant laughter that shocked the US State Department into a panic. Dulles, who was on the way, hurriedly called from Fairbanks, Alaska: What to do!? Eisenhower, who was spending the night at his mother-in-law's house, quickly rewrote the speech he was preparing to deliver in Los Angeles. The American news used a series of words:
  "Surprise" "Disappointment" "Tragedy" "Collapse" and other words. All this illustrates a truth, that is, this young and loud laughter is not only from a coast of China, but from all corners of the earth that are fighting for freedom. It will vibrate louder and louder on the land, on the sea, and in the sky. It is announcing the final death of colonialism! For ourselves, I don't need to say anything more. Our road is magnificent and surging forward. I know that all the people on the construction front, when you think of the brothers on the Fujian front fighting against the sea breeze and breaking through the waves, your eyes will be brighter, and you will carve this treasure of our socialist life more beautifully and more brilliantly. Finally, I would also like to mention one point: those poems copied in my notebook. As I walked and walked on the front line, I felt more and more that the poem I mentioned at the beginning was a shining verse. "With blue skies overhead and feet on the ocean" - it deeply expresses the broad and far-reaching minds of our fighters. Don't you think? It is the people with such minds who wrote such poems, because it is not only written with wisdom, but also written with blood.

    头顶青天足踏海洋的人们
    ——福建前线速写之三
    刘白羽
    我现在在福建前线一处炮兵阵地上。在这儿，可以听到急风骤雨般的炮声，可以看到炮弹崩起的黑云和那云烟中闪烁的火光。我对面坐着一位青年战士，他微微仰着下颚，眼光那样柔和、庄重，他说：“人家在生产上屡放‘卫星’，我们在前线打不好怎么对得起……”这时我不能不想到一切在建设战线上的人们。当你们在炼钢的火光中或是在那湍急的河流的工地上，在田间的红旗下或是在探索宝藏的最高的峰巅，总之，当你们为我们美好生活放下一块基石或者获得一分成就时，你们可曾向祖国的东南方眺望过吗？那时，你们都想过在福建海防前线上的自己的兄弟吗？我相信我会得到多么肯定的回答。是的，前线和后方就是这样紧密地交织在一处，溶结在一起的。建设中的每一跃进的闪光都照亮了战士的心，无论黎明的曙色还是午夜的星光，特别是当风从遥远的陆地上吹来的时候，前线的战士是怎样震奋、怎样庄严地从中感到整个祖国的鼓舞呀！于是，刚才这个青年战士所说的诺言就变成巨大的行动，人们一次又一次投入激烈的战斗，人们一次又一次用自己生命的火焰创造出光彩辉煌的战绩。
    当我顺了交通沟走着，走着，来到了一个海岸炮的堡垒时，我给一张一张红纸绿纸写的诗传单吸引住了，我特别从中抄下这样的诗句：
    头顶青天足踏海洋，
    保卫祖国的大门。
    我回转身，一群青年人出现在大炮周围。他们有的戴着洗得发白了的军便帽，有的光着头，有的在额顶上吊着风镜，有的穿着蓝色海军服，有的就穿着一件白衬衫，他们都那样笑盈盈的。
    可是我是处在不平凡的人中间！我在心中轻轻这样告诉自己。还在厦门时，我就听到人们告诉我说：“英勇、顽强、坚决，是海岸炮兵的特点。围头前线打得最艰苦，也最出色，有两个连的第一炮都被评为英雄炮。”
    先让我们看看我们的英雄炮吧！巨大的炮座像个机械的铁山，又粗又长的炮筒森严地伸出火口。我在抗日战争初期访问过人民的第一个炮兵团。后来在松花江的冰天雪地中，头一回看到马拉的炮车，披着白布雪衣，同我们一道开赴前方，那时战士们从心里发出笑声，拍着手喊：“看呀！大家伙上阵了！”在朝鲜前线，我们欣赏过我们炮火的交响曲。但是我却第一次和这样的“炮中之神”见面。它的火口对着海洋，对着金门岛。就是它们在局势紧张的8月首先发出响亮的吼声。
    听一听前线的指挥员和战斗员的愉快的倾诉吧！
    “有一次，空军出动了，就从我们面前这海面上低低地飞掠过去。”
    “不错，后来就在海空上展开一场激战，我们的小银燕一下子把两架敌机抛落到海底去了。”
    “还有一回，我们在下面打炮，飞机在上面保护，战士们仰起头看着飞机尾巴上的白线，说这是对艾森豪威尔的警告。”
    “让我告诉你，那时候才真是好看呢！夜晚，探照灯从四面八方把海面照得通明，我们严密地封锁着，不要说小舢板不能偷渡上金门岛，就是一只海鸟也逃不出我们的眼睛”。
    那时，那炎热的8月，那刚刚吹过台风和密雨的8月，杜勒斯在中近东燃起侵犯阿拉伯人民的火焰，又在台湾海峡掀起一股对中国挑衅的风浪。是可忍，孰不可忍？于是我们就向海上展开了惩罚性的炮火袭击。炮火是猛烈的。前一阵，蒋介石匪帮还在前沿的广播筒里虚张声势、大吹牛皮：“你们不是准备好了吗？准备好了为什么还不打，你们要打一炮，我们就打一炮，……”现在一阵炮火，他们就慌作一团，大呼大喊：“在下雨！在下雨！”那么，还是让我们看看在我们炮阵地上的战斗者吧！——他们一个个穿着一道道蓝色波纹的背心，赤裸的双臂上闪着温漉漉的闪光，炮弹出口震动得那样凶猛，燃起一阵阵黑烟，瓦斯刺人喉咙，灰尘弥漫空间，阵地里火一样闷热，脚底下连油带水变成泥泞。但是炮在急速地跳跃着，射击着，最猛的一阵打到七秒钟一发，炮筒通红，放上药包，简直不用拉炮，炮弹就自个儿飞出去了。让人民的强大炮声来给历史作结论的时候到了。在“黑暗的东方”——把炮口对准亚洲和非洲的脑膛，便可任意地吸取财富与鲜血，那种殖民主义的“黄金时代”，随着早已枯黄的历史一页而掀过去了。一阵炮火闪烁，停泊在料罗湾中的一只“美”字号运输舰爆炸了，突然间，一股黑烟直冲高空，就像一面黑伞慢慢张开，烟和火整整烧了一天，……
    优秀的炮兵指挥员宋思仟，在他的连部坑道里的电灯光下，在一阵沉思之后，对我说：
    “关键问题在于时间！敌人的兵舰×分钟就从我们炮火的射界前面过去了。那一天，我们在×分钟内把八十发炮弹一起发出去，就打中了敌舰。从此他们的舰队就再也不敢在我们炮火面前摇摇摆摆了。”
    当然我知道，决定时间的关键在于人。四炮长宛德恒告诉我：“我们全班十几个人，全是义务兵，最年轻的一个才十九岁。”那就是说，祖国解放时还只十岁上下，他们是在社会主义阳光下成长的第一代新人。正如同瞄准手安业民在他的决心书中所写的，他们的心灵，从幼小时就被刘胡兰、黄继光、丘少云的光辉所照亮的。一个炮兵部队政治部主任和我这样说：“你还记得吧！从前有些这样的兵，他们在火线上非常勇敢，但是平时却吊儿浪当。现在可不是这样了，你去看看，他们是那样纯洁，可爱，在你面前甚至还有点儿腼腆，可是行动起来是那样勇敢，你指到哪儿就打到那儿！”当然，这是一个高级政治干部对于自己的战士最亲切的赞扬。如果你再听一听一个炮长又怎样谈论自己的战友呢！“他一点也不怕战争，可是他心里兢兢业业念念不忘的，就怕炮打不好。战前那一个星期，他总是不停歇地擦拭着瞄准机，擦拭着炮弹，……”
    现在，我不打算叙述他们在战斗中那种英勇神奇的故事。不过，透过那浓烈的硝烟，我们不能不看到一种精神，它像红旗一样在耀眼，像晨光一样在发亮。炮火日夜不停地纷飞叫啸，如果你走遍前沿阵地，你不但看到我们英雄炮身的壮大，而且你还会看到火炮身上的斑烂的战痕，那时，一种森然的英雄之感不由得不渗入到你的内心。但是有一点却显然地超乎一切之上；就是炮火再激烈，我们的人却比炮火还要激烈。
    现在，我们来认识认识这群年青的像鹰一样在我们晴朗的高空飞翔的炮手吧！
    这是炮长宛德恒，你看他的眉峰高耸，目光沉静，从他那海风吹得黑黑的胸脯上露出蓝色条纹的海军线衫，他的腰带环上雕着一只金色的海锚，但不论他肩膀多么坚实，一种年青人的纯真的笑容却不断地闪现。一次炮战方酣，一颗大炮弹装进炮膛，一拉火，却没响。怎么办！？围着炮的人们面面相觑，张大了眼睛。情况是危急的！如果拉开栓，也许炮弹恰恰在这一刹那间爆炸，如果等上五分钟再碰它，可是你算算，七秒钟一发，五分钟就是几十发炮，怎么办！？就在这时，青年炮长宛德恒对周围的同志们发布命令：“赶快散开！”他自己却一步冲上去，一把拉开炮闩，两手紧紧抱起药包，就冲出去了，这一门炮又继续和整个炮群一道鸣响起来。难道只有一个宛德恒吗？不，在另外一个海岸炮连里有个弹药手张仕发，他也碰到了同样艰难的局面。他也毫不迟疑地立刻把炮弹从炮膛里猛拉出来，可是炮弹已烤得火烫，也许还会突然爆炸。阵地里的同志们眼看他一阵风一样跑出去了。恰好在这时外面轰隆一声震响，大家以为他和炮弹一起爆炸了，他却一耸身跳了回来，原来刚才落下一发敌人的炮弹。在前线上，通过那暴风雨的夜晚和晴朗的清晨，人们就是这样，像火焰一样，带着高尚的忘我的精神生活着、战斗着。人，在这儿要不具有这种精神，他会耻辱的不能生活下去。炮长尹大安是这群青年中间最朴素、最老诚、最沉默的一个。在我们相处的时间内，他没有一句话说到自己，他说的都是别人。这并不是偶然的谦逊。在那样激烈的炮战中间，他也是那样的忘记了自己。突然一发炮弹落了下来，他立刻扑到正在讲电话的营长身上，拿身子挡住那纷飞的碎弹片；可是当他自己感到腿上一阵火热，他唯恐影响同志们的战斗情绪，却悄悄把挽起的裤筒往脚面上拉一拉，不过他的一只脚很快就给血水染红了。同样，我们也可以发现另一位炮长张作武，他冲进火焰中去营救战友，自己却烧伤昏晕地下，同志们救醒他，电话耳机还紧紧戴在耳朵上面，他说：“我还能听到命令！我还能指挥作战！”这一夜，他在医院里转来转去怎样也睡不着，他只忧虑着他不在阵地上他那门炮能不能打得好？当然有时他心中也批驳自己，同志们一定会干得很好，终于他还是说：“我要回去，我不能亲自指挥，我也要亲眼看着同志们打呀！”我见到神彩焕发的装填手管祠聪，他有匀称的细长的身材，不过你看一看他那双手，你就会说这是天生的装填手，那是把六十斤重的大炮弹可以像皮球般抛的大手。“关键问题在于时间！”就是他站在高高炮座上，一口气不停地装添了三百多发、火热、紧张，他一下扑倒在炮身上晕了过去，人们把他抬下，他醒转来在头上浇了点冷水，又爬上炮座。同样，就在他旁边那一个兄弟炮位上，炮战也以七秒钟一发的速度进行着，弹药手从弹药库扛起炮弹飞跑着，他晕倒在战壕里，一下又给炮弹爆炸的气浪震醒，他自己爬，爬到水筒边去拿凉水浇湿自己，又站起来往上跑，他这样晕倒了三次，站起来三次。……
    难道在这儿我只是为了讲叙每一个战斗者的经验吗？不，我想读者是完全可以理解这一点的。不过，为了客观，我想还是请一些西方人士来衡量我们战斗的结果吧！这个爱德华滋是美联社记者，他说：“一艘供应舰被直接命中了两颗炮弹，顿告炸毁，声震欲聋。”他的同伴凯里描写得更加生动些：“这艘舰只渐渐开动了。到处有炮弹落下。呼，呼，呼越来越猛的火力使舰上人员除了那些要把舰只驶离海滩的以外，都爬在甲板上。一颗火炮弹在左舷附近猛烈爆炸。烟直冒到甲板上。有人高呼：‘着火了，着火了！’”而一位“不能发表他的名字”的英国记者却在这儿发起誓来了，他说：“这是完全饱和的炮轰。瞬刻之间，空中密布了炮弹和开花弹，纷纷落在沙滩上和海面上。……炮弹在怒嗥着、呼啸着、轰响着——发出了各种令人讨厌的声音。我们立刻逃出了那个鬼地方。”他说：“以后我们永远永远不去了。”但正是在我们炮阵地上这许多敢于战胜艰难险阻的人，敲出最响亮的进军的鼓声，这咚咚的鼓声正催着下午六点钟的太阳最后的沉没。而继之将是一个自由的春天。
    战争的灰尘似乎并不能染污天空和海洋。从炮阵地火口望出去就是大海，黎明的海色蔚蓝得像琉璃般透明，黄昏却把海水映得像一片红胭脂，一到夜晚，要不是月光万顷，就是繁星低垂到海面上来，恍如万千灯火。人们不要把火线想成一片“恐怖”吧！奥斯特洛夫斯基讲得好：“当我们在前线上奔驰和体验着战斗的风暴时，难道你以为太阳就不照着我们或者生活就不是美好的吗？”人们热爱着自己光荣的战斗岗位，把阵地修成“花园”，变为“最亲爱的家”。这儿让我讲一个例子吧：电话员郑常健，他的信念是：“观察哨是炮兵的眼睛”，为了保护它，他匍匐在炮火下去接线。一下左臂炸断了，他就用一节电线把臂膀扎起，还是向前匍匐前进。后来他将要从阵地治疗所转往后方医院，可是他情感上唯一的依恋就是自己的“家”，他不论怎样还是回到炮阵地上又住了几天，然后才告别走了。在这里让我们细细体味一下战士们的心吧！在一个炮阵地上，战士们贴着自己画的色彩鲜明的图画，一幅画着他们一次炮战的速写，一幅画着钢焰冲天、粮食遍地的人民公社，最有趣的是他们用木板雕刻了一幅对联悬在门口：“祖国社会主义建设如骏马一日千里”，“战士热爱祖国之心如火焰热高万丈”，他们把野生的龙舌兰种植在战壕边沿上，还有那手巧的艺术家在炮工事上制出飞翔的和平鸽的浮雕。一个战士在坑道口阳光中为同志们补鞋，另一群战士在油印机旁忙着印自己连队的诗刊“万诗集”，在炮位上悬挂着从遥远的后方寄来的红领巾，在连部办公桌的玻璃板下陈设着万星灯火的天安门夜景的照片。战士在床架上安装了电池灯，在那淡蓝色的灯光下，我们可以看到聚精会神在看书的眼睛，可以听到嘹亮的手风琴声，……
    但是当战斗警报在阵地上空震响时，人们就迅速地投入战斗。人们在这里战得胜艰难险阻，也就发得出真正自豪的笑声。
    10月20日晨，美军舰队违反我国防部命令，又在海上进行护航。下午四时，前沿阵地的收音机前面挤满了人，都在屏息静气地聆听着彭德怀部长“恢复炮击，以示惩罚”的命令。正是那个时候，杜勒斯正飞往台湾。当我们的战士站起身来走向炮位时，我们听到了这样谈笑的声音：
    “好呀，杜勒斯辛辛苦苦这样远到台湾来，咱们得给他点礼物呀！”
    “你谈得对，那就让我们的炮弹去参加杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈吧！”
    请不要以为这只是福建前线两个普普通通的青年人的谈笑吧！正是这愉快的笑声，震动得美国国务院一片慌乱。半路途中的杜勒斯连忙从阿拉斯加费尔班克打电话问：怎么办！？在岳母家度夜的艾森豪威尔赶紧改写他准备在洛杉矶发表的演说，美国新闻中一连是用了：
  “惊讶”“失望”“悲剧”“崩溃”种种字眼。这一切说明一个真理，就是这年青而洪亮的笑声不止是从中国的一个海岸上，而是从地球上所有为自由而斗争的角落里发出，它将在土地上、在海洋上、在天空中愈震荡愈响亮，它在宣布殖民主义的最后的死亡！对于我们自己，我就不必再说什么了。我们的道路，是波澜壮阔，汹涌直前。我知道，一切在建设战线上的人们，当你们想到福建前线上迎着海风，冲破海浪而战的兄弟时，你们的眼睛将更加明亮，你们将把我们的社会主义生活这个珍宝雕琢得更加美丽，更加灿烂。最后，我还要讲到一点：就是抄在我扎记本中的那些诗。当我在前线走着、走着的时候，我愈来愈觉得我在开始时提到的那句诗是闪光的诗句。“头顶青天足踏海洋”——它正深深地表达了我们战斗者的辽阔而深远的心灵。你不觉得吗？正是这样心灵的人才写出了这样的诗，因为它不但是用智慧写的，而且是用血液写的。
