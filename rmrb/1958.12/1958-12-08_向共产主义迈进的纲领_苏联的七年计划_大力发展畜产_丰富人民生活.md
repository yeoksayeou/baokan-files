Program for Advancing Towards Communism
The Soviet Seven-Year Plan
Vigorously Develop Animal Husbandry - Enrich People's Lives
Two Different Speeds

With the great development of agriculture, the Soviet Union's animal husbandry has also been advancing by leaps and bounds in recent years. This can be seen from the following figures: in the past five years, the number of cattle has increased by approximately 14 million head, pigs by 14 million head, and sheep by 29 million. Compared with 1953, meat production in 1957 increased by 40%, milk by 50%, eggs by 40%, and wool by 20%. This rate of growth is many times faster than that of the United States. The total milk production in the United States in 1956 increased by only 4.2% compared to 1953; and in 1957, it increased by only 1% compared to 1956. The output of meat in the United States for the first eight months of last year not only did not increase, but actually decreased by 4% compared to the same period in 1956.

In terms of absolute quantities, the output of major livestock products in the Soviet Union has, in some cases, greatly exceeded that of the United States. For example, the Soviet Union produces one and a half times more wool than the United States; and in some cases, it is about to catch up with the United States. For example, milk production in the Soviet Union in 1957 was 54 million tons, compared to 57.55 million tons in the United States, with little difference remaining. It is expected that this year, milk production per capita will catch up with the United States.

Further Expand the Production of Livestock Products

The main task stipulated by the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for animal husbandry is to further expand the production of meat, milk, eggs, and wool. After seven years, meat production will reach 16 million tons, doubling the current amount; milk will increase to 100 million to 105 million tons, an increase of 70% to 80%; wool will increase to approximately 548,000 tons, an increase of 70%; and eggs will increase to 3.7 billion, an increase of 60%.

At the same time, the number of various livestock will be rapidly increased. Compared with the average increase in the past seven years, the average annual increase in the next seven years will be 2.2 times higher for cattle, with dairy cows increasing by 1.2 times, and sheep increasing by approximately one time. The increase in livestock products will further enrich the lives of the Soviet people and provide more raw materials for light industry.

Further Consolidate the Feed Base

In order to successfully complete the task of animal husbandry development, the first priority is to ensure that animal husbandry in all regions of the country has a sufficient quantity of diverse and high-quality feed. Therefore, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that 85 million to 90 million tons of grain will be allocated for livestock as concentrated feed in 1965. At the same time, hay production will be doubled, silage production will be tripled, and the amount of potatoes allocated for feed will be more than double that of 1957.

Among silage feeds, livestock most favors corn. Experience in recent years has proven that corn is not only high-yielding (at least 500 quintals of green fodder with ears can be harvested per hectare), but also juicy and nutritious, ensuring high milk yields. In the past three years, collective farms and state farms in the Soviet Union have nearly doubled milk production, which is closely related to the establishment of a solid feed base. The consolidation of the feed base is, in turn, the result of large-scale corn cultivation. Therefore, the Seven-Year Plan will pay special attention to increasing corn production.

    向共产主义迈进的纲领
    苏联的七年计划
    大力发展畜产  丰富人民生活
    两种不同的速度
    随着农业的大发展，苏联的畜牧业这几年也在大步前进。这从下面的数字就可以看出：最近五年来，牛大约增加一千四百万头，猪增加一千四百万口，羊增加二千九百万只。肉的产量，1957年同1953年相比，增加了40％，牛奶增加了50％，蛋类增加了40％，羊毛增加了20％。这种增长的速度要比美国快许多倍。美国1956年的牛奶总产量比1953年只增加4.2％；1957年比1956年只增加了1％。去年八个月的美国肉类的产量不但没有增加，反而比1956年同期下降了4％。
    以绝对数量言，苏联主要的畜产品产量，有的已大大超过美国，例如，羊毛产量，苏联比美国多一倍半；有的即将赶上美国，例如牛奶产量，1957年苏联为五千四百万吨，美国为五千七百五十五万吨，已相差无几，预计今年牛奶产量按人口平均计算即可赶上美国。
    再扩大畜产品产量
    苏联的七年计划为畜牧业规定的主要任务，就是再扩大肉类、乳类、蛋类和羊毛的产量。七年后肉类产量将达一千六百万吨，即增加一倍；乳类增加为一亿吨到一亿零五百万吨，即增加70％到80％；羊毛大约增加为五十四万八千吨，即增加70％；蛋类增加为三十七亿个，即增加60％。
    同时还要迅速增加各种牲畜的头数。今后七年每年平均增长的头数，与过去七年的平均增长相比，牛要增加二点二倍，其中乳牛增长一点二倍，羊大约增加一倍。畜产品的增长将使苏联人民的生活更加丰富，并为轻工业提供更多的原料。
    进一步巩固饲料基地
    为了顺利完成畜牧业发展的任务，首先就要保证全国一切地区的畜牧业有足够数量的、多种多样的优质饲料。因此，七年计划规定在1965年为牲畜要拨出八千五百万吨到九千万吨谷物作精饲料。同时干草的产量要增加一倍，青贮饲料的产量要增加三倍，拨作饲料用的马铃薯要比1957年增多一倍。
    在青贮饲料中，牲畜最喜爱的是玉蜀黍。过去几年的经验证明，玉蜀黍不仅是产量高（每公顷至少可以收获五百公担带穗的青饲料），而且多汁和营养丰富，可以保证很高的挤奶量。近三年来，苏联集体农庄和国营农场把牛奶产量提高了将近一倍，这与建立巩固的饲料基地有着密切的关系，而饲料基地的巩固，却又是大量种植玉蜀黍的结果，因此，七年计划将特别注意玉蜀黍的增产。（附图片）
