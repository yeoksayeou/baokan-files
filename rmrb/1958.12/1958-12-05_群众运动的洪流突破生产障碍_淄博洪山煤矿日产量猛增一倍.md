Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 4th: The Hongshan Coal Mine in Zibo City, Shandong Province, has vigorously launched a mass movement, resulting in a doubling of production levels. Daily coal production has increased from 4,200 tons in July to over 9,000 tons, with a peak of 10,032 tons.

In the first half of this year, the Hongshan Coal Mine's production level only increased by a little over 30%. In the second half of the year, the coal mine's Party committee used the spirit of rectification to examine its ideological style. It analyzed and criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some leading cadres in the coal mine, who didn't trust the masses, and launched a mine-wide debate on issues such as "Can the coal mine vigorously launch a mass movement?" During the airing of views and debates, the masses put up more than 40,000 big-character posters, criticizing the "seeing things but not people" thinking of some leading cadres. Subsequently, the entire mine launched a mass movement to "learn from the advanced, compete with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced." A leap forward in production quickly emerged, and many difficulties were readily solved. For example, in the past, when No. 3 vertical shaft used skip hoists, it could only hoist 700 to 800 tons per day. Now, thanks to the old workers' transformation of the vertical shaft hoisting system into an inclined shaft double-track hoisting system, and the replacement of skips with double-deck cages, the shaft's production level has increased from more than 100 tons per day to more than 2,900 tons per day.

The torrent of the mass movement has also broken through many rules and regulations that restricted production in this mine. In the past, they generally implemented a single cycle of coal mining per shift, with pure production time accounting for only one-third of the 24 hours. Now, it has been changed to double, triple, or even quadruple cycles per day, turning what was originally one working face into two to four working faces. Without increasing equipment or personnel, the entire mine produces more than 1,000 tons of coal more per day.

When the vigorous mass movement began, some cadres were worried that it would cause chaos in production order and increase accidents. This concern has now been shattered by the facts. Now, the management cadres in this mine have been reduced by more than half in the implementation of "two participations and one reform" compared to the past. The underground site has also changed from a single cycle to multiple cycles, requiring even tighter coordination of work processes. However, the workers manage it very well themselves. Everyone consciously abides by the instructions on the cycle charts, and they take the initiative to reinforce weak links, so the regular cycle rate increases month by month.

Some cadres in this mine were previously worried that launching a mass movement would lead to an imbalance between mining and tunneling, resulting in a situation where there would be no coal to mine. However, after the masses were mobilized, they overfulfilled the tunneling plan every month, and the tunneling speed increased by more than double compared to the past.

    群众运动的洪流突破生产障碍
    淄博洪山煤矿日产量猛增一倍
    据新华社济南4日电  山东淄博市洪山煤矿大搞群众运动，使生产水平猛增一倍。每天产煤量由7月间的四千二百吨，提高到九千多吨，最高曾达到一万零三十二吨。
    今年上半年，洪山煤矿的生产水平只提高了30％多。下半年，煤矿党委用整风精神检查了思想作风，对煤矿部分领导干部不相信群众的右倾保守思想进行了分析批判，并发动全矿职工就“煤矿能不能大搞群众运动”等问题进行大辩论。在鸣放辩论中，群众贴了四万多张大字报，批判了一些领导干部“见物不见人”的思想。接着，全矿展开了“学先进、比先进、赶先进”的群众性运动，生产上迅速出现了跃进局面，许多困难都迎刃而解，如三号立井过去用箕斗式提升机时，每天只能提升七、八百吨，现在经老工人将立井提升改为斜井双轨提升，将箕斗改为双层罐笼，这个井的生产水平由日产一百多吨提高到日产二千九百多吨。
    群众运动的洪流还冲破了这个矿的许多束缚生产的清规戒律。过去他们普遍推行一班采煤单一循环，一昼夜中纯生产时间只占三分之一；现改为一天双循环、三循环，甚至四循环，使原先的一个工作面变成了两个到四个工作面，既不增加设备，又不增添人员，全矿每天就多产一千多吨煤。
    在开始大搞群众运动时，有的干部曾担心这样会造成生产秩序混乱，事故增多，这一顾虑现已被事实所打破。现在这个矿的管理干部在贯彻“两参一改”中比以前减少了一半还多，井下现场又由单一循环改为多循环，工序衔接更需严密。但是，工人自己管得很好，大家都自觉地遵守循环图表的指示，发现薄弱环节就动手突击，因此正规循环率逐月增加。
    这个矿有些干部过去曾顾虑搞群众运动会出现采掘不平衡，造成无煤可采的现象，但是群众发动起来以后，月月超额完成掘进计划，掘进速度较前提高一倍还多。
