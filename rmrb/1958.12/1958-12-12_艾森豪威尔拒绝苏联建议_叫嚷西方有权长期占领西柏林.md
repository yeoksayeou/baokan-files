Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th December: U.S. President Eisenhower reiterated his rejection of the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city at a press conference on the 10th. He clamored that the West could not "retreat" on the Berlin issue.

Despite the fact that the Western three powers' blatant violation of the Potsdam Agreement has deprived them of the legal basis for occupying West Berlin, Eisenhower insisted that the West "not only has the right but also the responsibility" to continue to霸占(bà zhàn - forcibly occupy) West Berlin.

Eisenhower indicated that the United States would use the proposal of so-called "free elections to unify Germany" to resist the Soviet proposal. As everyone knows, the "free elections" proposal consistently played by the West is essentially an attempt to extend the rule of West Germany's Adenauer to the German Democratic Republic. Eisenhower said, "Until this issue (referring to the so-called "free elections" issue) is finally resolved through some agreement among all countries—including Germany, of course—we believe we have the responsibility and the obligation—that is to say, we not only have the right—to safeguard the freedom of West Berlin," and the West "has consistently insisted that this must be done through free elections."

    艾森豪威尔拒绝苏联建议
    叫嚷西方有权长期占领西柏林
    新华社11日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔10日在记者招待会上再一次表示拒绝苏联关于把西柏林变为自由城市的建议，他叫嚷西方不能在柏林问题上“退却”。
    尽管西方三国对波茨坦协定的粗暴蹂躏已经使它们丧失了占领西柏林的法理基础，艾森豪威尔还是硬说，西方“不仅有权利而且有责任”继续霸占西柏林。
    艾森豪威尔表示，美国将用所谓通过“自由选举统一德国”的主张来抵挡苏联的建议。大家知道，西方一贯耍弄的“自由选举”的主张实质就是企图把西德阿登纳的统治扩大到德意志民主共和国去。艾森豪威尔说，“在这个问题（指所谓“自由选举”问题）通过所有的国家——其中当然包括德国——的某种协议最后得到解决以前，我们认为我们有责任也有义务——这就是说我们不仅有权利——维护柏林西部的自由”，而西方是“一贯坚持必须用自由选举的方法来做到这一点的”。
