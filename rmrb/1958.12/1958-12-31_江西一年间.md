Jiangxi in a Year
By our reporter Li Lianbin

1958 was an extremely glorious year for Jiangxi's industrial construction.

In this year, the history of industrial construction in Jiangxi Province added many new chapters and wrote many valuable experiences. The most valuable experience, in addition to putting politics in command, was to vigorously carry out mass movements. Due to the vigorous mass movement, a "sketch of an industrial base" appeared in the picture of the "land of fish and rice." This kind of situation was difficult to imagine in the past, but today's reality is developing in this way.

	One Blank Sheet of Paper

When the Party Central Committee put forward the call to organize a great leap forward in industry, some cadres believed that this was a difficult problem for Jiangxi. "There is not much foundation in industry, how can we leap forward?" "To jump, you must have a place to stand, if you don't, how can you jump?" Some people compared Jiangxi's industry to a broken car, which can still go, but if it runs, it will fall apart. In short, some cadres, including some leaders of the prefectural and county committees, had serious doubts about whether Jiangxi's industry could make a great leap forward. This doubt was not without foundation. It is a fact that Jiangxi's industrial base is relatively weak. Basic industries such as metallurgy, machinery, electric power, coal, and basic chemicals are incomplete and very weak. At the time of liberation in 1949, there were only two coal mines and five machinery repair shops in the province, and no machines could be manufactured. The annual output of local iron was only about 500 tons, which was only used for manufacturing agricultural tools, and there was no steel at all. Although Jiangxi's industry has developed greatly in 1957, it is still weak. The central government has not organized many basic industrial projects in Jiangxi, only three machinery manufacturing plants, and no other larger enterprises. As for a county, there is even less industry to speak of. A limerick vividly reflects this situation:

Little Dingnan County,
No factories can be seen;
For hundreds of miles around,
Three tofu shops are found.

Among the 82 counties in Jiangxi Province, there are not many counties with one or two basic industrial factories. Some people use "a blank sheet of paper" to describe Jiangxi's industrial foundation. By 1957, this blank sheet of paper had some color, but the industrial base was still weak. There were different views on whether a great leap forward could be achieved. It was Chairman Mao's magnificent idea of "a blank sheet of paper, without burdens, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures" that unified the different views and brought great encouragement to all cadres and the broad masses of people in Jiangxi.

	Have Pen and Paint

But here comes the most practical question: Writing and drawing require pens and paints, and developing basic industries requires mineral deposits. Are mineral deposits sufficient? This is the doubt of many people. However, Jiangxi's geological workers traveled across mountains and ridges and provided strong evidence. Jiangxi's mineral deposits are surprisingly rich, from ferrous metals to non-ferrous metals, to rare metals, to non-metals, everything is available. Coal reserves are both large and of good quality. The three coal areas of Pingxiang, Fengcheng, and Leping, which have been explored, have reserves of 1.8 billion tons. But in fact, more than 60 of the 82 counties in Jiangxi Province have coal. From Pingxiang to Shangrao, from Shangrao to Jingdezhen, more than 500 kilometers from east to west and more than 100 kilometers from north to south, coal can be mined everywhere, forming what geologically is called a "sea of coal," which is rare in reality. The proven coal reserves in the province have reached several billion tons, but the actual amount is much larger than the known figures. Jiangxi's coal includes bituminous coal and oil shale. The oil shale in Leping has an oil content that is rare in the world. In the past, some people thought that Jiangxi did not produce iron ore or had very little iron ore. However, exploration has now proved that not only is there iron ore, but there is also a lot of it. The XinYu Iron Mine has proven reserves of at least 500 million tons. This spring, a huge magnetite mine was discovered on the border of five counties in central Jiangxi: Yi, Ji'an, Xiajiang, Anfu. This mine is 40 kilometers long, covering an area of more than 400 square kilometers. The thickness of the ore layer averages 50 to 60 meters, and the thickest is 120 meters, with reserves of over 7 billion tons. This is one of the largest iron ore deposits discovered in China so far.

How rich are Jiangxi's mineral resources! The strange thing is that Jiangxi does not produce any steel. This is unreasonable. However, as long as there is the Communist Party, this unreasonable situation will inevitably change.

	Vigorously Carry Out Mass Movements

There is paper, there are paints, who will draw? Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, said: "We ourselves do not have the experience of running industry. Chairman Mao called on our entire Party to find and create a road for industrial construction in our country. Now this road has been found. In addition to the general line, several parallel advancements, and walking on two legs, that is, vigorously carrying out mass movements in industry." Jiangxi Province launched a mass movement of the entire Party and the entire people to run industry throughout the province. The province runs it, the special zone runs it, the county runs it, and the commune also runs it. Government agencies run it, schools run it, and the farms run by transferred cadres also run it. Ninety-seven old Red Army soldiers in Yongxin County ran a "Red Army Iron Smelting Plant," and molten iron flowed smoothly. The mass movement has made factories spread all over Jiangxi's cities and villages, all over the plains and mountains. Many things that were not valued by people have become valuable assets of the country; even wild plants that have been sleeping for thousands of years have begun to awaken. Various places have set up many wild plant processing plants. Jinggangshan alone has established more than a dozen factories for papermaking, brewing, mountain peppertree essential oil, artificial fiber, etc. Run the iron and steel industry, run the machinery industry, run the chemical industry, run the coal industry. Run heavy industry, but also run light industry. From the Yangtze River to Poyang Lake, from Mufu Mountain to Wugong Mountain, from Jinggang Mountain to Ruijin, the vast land of the entire Jiangxi is playing the triumphant song of industrial construction. The XinYu Iron and Steel Plant with an annual output of 1.5 million tons and the Nanchang Iron and Steel Plant with an annual output of 1 million tons are under construction. The Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant is being expanded into an iron and steel joint enterprise, and a new 82-cubic-meter blast furnace has been put into production. Tractor factories, diesel engine factories, motor factories, steam turbine factories, water turbine factories, transformer factories, measuring tool and cutting tool factories, and heavy machine tool factories have all started construction, and some have already been partially put into production. In this year, there were 52 construction projects above the province's limit, 9 of which were completed and put into production, and 7 were partially put into production. As for the industries run by counties, townships, and communes, it is impossible to express them in numbers. The mass movement of small indigenous methods and the mass movement of foreign methods have formed Jiangxi's high speed of construction; a prototype of a new national industrial base is being formed, and a preliminary outline of the newest and most beautiful picture is taking shape.

Jiangxi's practice proves that the road of mass movement is the road of high speed. One person, one pen, fills the blank paper with pictures.

	Blooming and Bearing Fruit

The mass movement, which was launched on the basis of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to liberate thinking, break superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, has created many miracles. If we think of Jiangxi's machinery industry, which could not manufacture any machines, but actually manufactured technologically complex, modern, and newest machines, and some machines reached or exceeded advanced levels, how can we not be excited? In just a few months, more than 200 sets of complete equipment for manufacturing steelmaking converters and ironmaking blast furnaces were manufactured, and blowers, generators, transformers, metal cutting machine tools, and power machinery could be manufactured. Even technically complex tractors and automobiles were manufactured under the conditions of "insufficient equipment, insufficient materials, and insufficient technology."

Steel, which did not exist at all in the past, is now measured in tens of thousands of tons this year; iron, which was only a few thousand tons per year in the past, has been produced in hundreds of thousands of tons in just two or three months this year. "Grasp the key link and everything else falls into place." The coal industry and light industry, and all industries are leaping forward at high speed. Coal production was only more than 2 million tons last year, but by October this year, it has produced 8.2 million tons, and it is estimated that it will produce 9.2 million tons for the whole year. Light industry such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cigarettes, matches, soap, flour, edible vegetable oil, and麻袋 have all increased significantly, of which edible vegetable oil has increased by more than 50%. The policy of taking steel as the key link has driven and promoted the high-speed development of Jiangxi's entire industry. This year, the province's total industrial output value has increased greatly compared with last year. By October, it had reached 1.757677 billion yuan, which was 182% of the same period last year. It is expected that it will catch up with or exceed the total agricultural output value by the end of the year.

Jiangxi's industrial mass movement has brought about profound changes in people's thinking. The power generated in this aspect is indeed immeasurable. This mass movement, which has never happened in history, has jumped out of the circle of a few people running industry and laid the foundation for the entire Party and the entire people to run industry in Jiangxi. It can be predicted that Jiangxi's industry will have a greater leap forward in the future, and draw newer and more beautiful pictures on Jiangxi's 250 million mu of land!

    江西一年间
    本报记者  李连斌
    1958年对江西工业建设说来是极其辉煌的一年。
    在这一年里，江西省的工业建设史增添了许多新的篇章，写下了许多宝贵的经验，其中最宝贵的经验，除政治挂帅外，就是大搞群众运动。由于大搞群众运动，在“鱼米之乡”的图画中，出现了“工业基地”的素描。这种情景过去是很难想像的，但今天的现实确是这样发展着。
        一  张  白  纸
    当党中央提出组织工业大跃进的号召后，某些干部认为这对江西是一个难题。“工业没有多少底子，怎么能跃进呢？”“跳，要有站脚的地方，没有，怎能跳呢？”有的人把江西工业比作破车，走还可以，如果跑，就会散架子。总之，某些干部，包括某些地委和县的领导干部，对江西工业能不能大跃进，有着重重的怀疑。这种怀疑不是没有根据的。江西工业基础比较薄弱这是事实。基本工业——冶金、机械、电力、煤炭、基本化学等缺胳膊少腿，残缺不全，贫弱得很。1949年解放时，全省只有两个煤矿，五个机械修配厂，什么机器都不能造。土铁年产只五百来吨，仅供制造农具用，钢一点没有。1957年江西工业虽有很大发展，但仍然是薄弱的，中央在江西举办的基本工业项目也不多，只有三个机械制造厂，其他比较大型的企业就没有了。就一个县来说，更谈不上有甚么工业了。有一首打油诗生动地反映了这种情况：
    小小定南县，工厂看不见；方圆几百里，三家豆腐店。
    江西全省八十二个县中，没有几个县有一个或两个基本工业的工厂。有人拿“一张白纸”来比喻江西的工业基础。到1957年，这张白纸着了一些颜色，但工业基础仍然薄弱。对能不能大跃进有着不同的看法。还是毛主席提出的“一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图”的宏伟思想，统一了不同的看法，给江西的全体干部和广大人民群众带来了巨大的鼓舞。
        有笔有颜料
    但这里提出一个最实际的问题：写字画图，要笔、要颜料，发展基本工业要矿藏。矿藏充足吗？这是许多人的怀疑。但，江西地质工作者翻山越岭，提供了有力的证据。江西的矿藏丰富得惊人，从黑色金属到有色金属，到稀有金属，到非金属，应有尽有。煤的藏量既多且好。已经勘探过的萍乡、丰城、乐平等三个煤区，藏量就有十八亿吨。但实际上，江西省八十二个县，就有六十多个县有煤。从萍乡到上饶，从上饶到景德镇东西五百多公里，南北一百多公里，到处都可挖出煤来，形成地质学上所说的、在实际上少见的“煤海”。现在全省已探明的煤炭藏量达几十亿吨，但实际有的数量比已经知道的数字大得多。江西的煤有烟煤还有油煤，乐平的油煤，含油量之高为世界罕见。以前有些人以为江西没有铁矿或很少铁矿。但是，现在勘探证明，不仅有而且很多。新喻铁矿已查明藏量最少有五亿多吨，今年春天在江西中部分宜、吉安、峡江、安福等五个县的边境，发现一个巨大的磁铁矿。这个矿，长达四十公里，面积四百余平方公里，矿层厚度平均五到六十公尺，最厚的达一百二十公尺，储量在七十亿吨以上。这是我国目前发现的最大的铁矿之一。
    江西的矿产资源多么丰富啊！奇怪的是江西不产一点钢。这是不合理的。但是，只要有共产党，这种不合理的情况必然要改变。
        大搞群众运动
    纸有，颜料也有，由谁来画呢？中共江西省委书记白栋材说：“我们自己没有办工业的经验，毛主席号召我们全党寻找和创造我国工业建设道路，现在这条道路找到了，除了总路线、几个并举、两条腿走路，那就是工业大搞群众运动。”江西省在全省范围内发动了全党全民办工业的群众运动。省办，专区办，县办，社也办。机关办，学校办，下放干部垦殖场也办。永新县九十七个老红军办了一个“红军炼铁厂”，铁水畅流。群众运动使工厂遍布江西的城市和乡村，遍布平原和山野，许多不为人们重视的东西，变成了国家的宝贵财富；连千年沉睡的野生植物也开始苏醒。各地都办了很多野生植物加工厂。只井冈山就兴办了造纸、酿酒、山苍子香料、人造纤维等十几个工厂。办钢铁工业，办机械工业，办化学工业，办煤炭工业。办了重工业，还办轻工业。从长江到鄱阳湖，从幕埠山到武功山，从井冈山到瑞金，整个江西的广阔的土地上，高奏着工业建设的凯歌。年产一百五十万吨的新喻钢铁厂和年产一百万吨的南昌钢铁厂正在兴建，萍乡钢铁厂正扩建为钢铁联合企业，新装一座八十二立方公尺的高炉，已经投入生产。拖拉机厂、柴油机厂、电机厂、汽轮机厂、水轮机厂、变压器厂、量具刃具厂、重型机床厂都着手兴建，有的已经部分投入生产。在这一年里，全省限额以上的建设项目就有五十二个，完成投入生产的有九个，部分投入生产的有七个，至于县、乡、社办的工业，就无法用数字表明了。小土的群众运动和大洋的群众运动，形成了江西建设的高速度；一个新的国家的工业基地的雏型在形成，一幅最新最美的画图初具轮廓。
    江西的实践证明：群众运动的道路是高速度的道路，一人一笔，就把白纸画满了画图。
      开花结果
    在党中央和毛主席解放思想、破除迷信，敢想、敢说、敢作的指示基础上开展起来的群众运动，创造了许多奇迹。我们如果想到不能制造任何机器的江西机械工业，而居然制造了技术复杂的、现代的最新的机器，并有些机器达到或超过先进水平，怎能不令人兴奋呢？在短短的几个月里，制造炼钢转炉和炼铁高炉的成套设备二百多套，鼓风机、发电机、变压器、金属切削机床、动力机械都能制造了，连技术特别复杂的拖拉机和汽车，在“设备不足，材料不足，技术不足”的情况下，也制造出来了。
    钢，过去一点没有，今年却以万吨计；铁，过去每年只几千吨，今年在短短的二、三个月中却搞了几十万吨。“纲举目张”，煤炭工业和轻工业等一切工业都在高速度跃进。煤炭，去年只产二百多万吨，今年到10月已产八百二十万吨，预计全年可产九百二十万吨。轻工业棉纱、棉布、卷烟、火柴、肥皂、面粉、食用植物油、麻袋等都有很大增长，其中食用植物油增长50％多。以钢为纲的方针带动和促进了江西整个工业高速地发展。今年全省工业产值比去年有很大增长。到10月已达十七亿五千七百六十七万元，为去年同期的182％，预计到年底可赶上或超过农业总产值。
    江西工业群众运动，使人们的思想起了深刻的变化，这方面产生的力量，确实是无法估量的。这种历史上从未有过的群众运动，跳出了少数人办工业的圈子，奠定了江西全党全民办工业的基础，可以预计今后江西工业会有更大的跃进，在江西的二亿五千万亩土地上画出更新更美的画图！
