    Turning Passive into Active
    Bai Jin
    The work of transportation departments in many places is indeed very passive now. There are few vehicles and many goods, and consignors are crowding at the door to request vehicles, which is simply overwhelming. Of course, this cannot be blamed on the transportation departments. Taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round Great Leap Forward, although transportation capacity has also increased, it still cannot keep up with demand. It seems that this will be a phenomenon for a considerable period.
    The current question is, in a very passive situation, can we become more proactive? Yes. The news published in this newspaper today about the Dongcheng District Transportation Department of Beijing creating the "Five Fixes" circular transportation method is an example. The work of the Dongcheng District Transportation Command in Beijing was originally very passive. However, they actively tried to extricate themselves from this passive situation, grasped the laws of material flow and direction, discovered the elimination of empty runs, counter-current and other unreasonable transportation, and created the "Five Fixes" circular transportation method. As a result, they tapped great potential and solved great problems.
    The experience of the Dongcheng District Transportation Command in Beijing tells us that the more passive we are, the more we must strive to be proactive. Some comrades always think that when work has fallen into a passive state, they can only cope and parry; and there is no way to strive for initiative. These comrades do not know that using passive methods to deal with a passive situation will not work; only by striving to take the initiative can we get rid of the predicament of being overwhelmed. The key to gradually improving transportation work lies here.
    So, how to turn passive into active? Grasping the laws of things is a very important point. The development of everything has its own laws. Mastering this law gives us the initiative; violating this law puts us in a passive position. Take unreasonable transportation such as empty runs and counter-currents! This is not a new problem. It was proposed several years ago to eliminate unreasonable transportation such as empty runs and counter-currents. Even today, under such tight transportation conditions, unreasonable transportation such as empty runs and counter-currents still exists in large quantities in many places. Why? One of the important reasons is that we have not grasped the law of material flow and have to shout slogans without being able to take concrete measures. Why can Dongcheng District in Beijing reduce the mileage of empty cars by 70%? The reason is that they have grasped the law of material flow, and instead of just shouting slogans, they have formulated practical measures based on this law of transportation.
    The laws of things are objective. Whoever masters it wins the initiative and can fully develop subjective initiative; whoever lacks understanding of objective laws is bound to be passive. People's subjective understanding often lags behind objective reality; passivity is often unavoidable at the beginning. However, as long as we are good at studying, grasping, and utilizing objective laws, it is entirely possible to turn passivity into initiative. This is true of transportation work, and it is true of other work as well.

    变被动为主动
    柏今
    许多地方运输部门的工作，现在确实很被动。车少货多，托运单位都挤到门上来要车，简直应付不过来。这，当然不能归罪于运输部门。以钢为纲，全面跃进，运输力量虽也有增加，但还赶不上需要，看来这是一个相当长时期的现象。
    目前的问题是在非常被动的情况下，能不能变得主动一些呢？能。今天本报发表的北京市东城区运输部门创造“五定”循环运输方法的新闻，就是一个例子。北京市东城区运输指挥部的工作本来也是很被动的。但他们积极设法从这种被动状况中解脱出来，掌握了物资流量和流向的规律，发现了消灭空驶、对流等不合理运输，创造了“五定”循环运输法，结果挖掘了很大的潜力，解决了很大的问题。
    北京市东城区运输指挥部的这个经验告诉我们，越是被动的时候，越要争取主动。有些同志总以为，工作已陷于被动，就只能应付、招架；而谈不到什么争取主动了。这些同志不知道，用被动的办法来应付被动的局面是应付不下去的；只有力争主动，才能从穷于应付的窘境中解脱出来。运输工作欲求渐有起色，关键就在这里。
    那么，怎样变被动为主动呢？掌握事情的规律，是很重要的一条。一切事情的发展都有自己的规律。掌握了这个规律，就有了主动；违反了这个规律，就陷于被动。拿空驶、对流等不合理的运输来说吧！这早已不是什么新问题了，几年以前就提出要消灭空驶、对流等不合理的运输；时至今日，在运输这样紧张的情况下，许多地方空驶、对流等不合理的运输还是大量存在。为什么呢？重要原因之一，就是没有掌握物资流向的规律，只好空喊，无法采取具体措施。北京市东城区为什么能使汽车空驶里程减少70％呢？原因就在于他们掌握了物资流向的规律，不是空喊一阵，而是根据这个运输的规律，订出了切切实实的措施。
    事物的规律是客观存在的东西。谁掌握了它，谁就赢得了主动，可以充分发挥主观能动性；谁对于客观规律缺乏了解，谁就不免被动。人的主观认识常常落后于客观实际；被动，在一开始的时候，也常常难以避免。但只要我们善于研究、掌握和利用客观规律，变被动为主动却是完全可能的。运输工作是如此，其他工作也是如此。
