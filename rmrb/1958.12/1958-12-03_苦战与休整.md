　　The Party and Chairman Mao often teach us to observe and handle problems using the two-point theory, to see both aspects of things, such as more and less, fast and slow, advanced and backward, advantageous and disadvantageous, and so on. Only by observing problems dialectically in this way can we have a comprehensive understanding of things and avoid one-sided errors in our work. Naturally, this should also be the case with the relationship between labor and rest, hard struggle and recuperation. They are contradictory and yet unified. By adjusting these two aspects well, production and construction can advance rhythmically, and the speed of construction can be continuously improved.

　　In the past year or so, China's industry, agriculture, and other construction undertakings have achieved unprecedented great development, and the achievements are extremely great. There are many reasons for the emergence of this miracle, but the most fundamental one is that the broad masses of the Chinese working people, under the leadership of the Party, have liberated their minds, raised their awareness, and exerted soaring enthusiasm. They have struggled and fought hard day and night, laboring without regard to remuneration or time, going wherever they are needed, and working for as long as necessary. What they think about is not comfort and rest, let alone wages and workdays, but wholeheartedly building socialism as soon as possible. Faced with such a situation, a leader should, on the one hand, continue to promote the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, encourage them to create even greater miracles, and not allow their labor enthusiasm to be frustrated in the slightest. This is what the Party and the people need, and the vast majority of leaders are doing this. On the other hand, leaders should also be more concerned about the lives of the masses, cherish their bodies, and ensure that they have adequate rest after strenuous labor and adequate recuperation after hard struggle. Only by correctly combining labor and rest, hard struggle and recuperation in this way can the masses maintain high enthusiasm for a long time, can the masses have abundant labor power, and thus make our cause advance at a consistently high speed. However, it must be pointed out that some local leaders do not pay enough attention to the latter aspect, and a few comrades even hold different opinions. They say, isn't it necessary to struggle hard? Why emphasize letting people rest well? With such hard struggle day and night, the work cannot be finished. If people are allowed to rest more, wouldn't it be even more impossible to complete the task? How can we leap forward then? In fact, as long as we think about it calmly and comprehensively and discuss it with the masses, these problems are easy to understand.

　　People know that our Party has always cared about the lives of the masses and has always paid attention to combining the immediate interests of the masses with their long-term interests, and appropriately coordinating the lives of the masses with production. As early as 1934, when the revolutionary struggle was still extremely difficult, Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods": "We are the leaders and organizers of the revolutionary war, and we are also the leaders and organizers of the lives of the masses. Organizing the revolutionary war and improving the lives of the masses are our two major tasks." The reason why the Party and Chairman Mao care so much about the lives of the masses and the work of the people is because people are the creators of history, the most important productive force, and the decisive factor in our great cause. Without people and without production, there would be nothing. Therefore, caring about people and caring about production are completely consistent; and to care about production, we must first care about people, and caring about people is precisely for the sake of caring about production. How to care about people? This requires correctly grasping the laws of people's lives, namely labor—rest—labor, and organizing the masses to carry out production according to this law. Specifically, it means ensuring that the masses have eight hours of sleep every day in general, and stipulating necessary public holidays so that the masses have time to take care of their personal affairs, as many places have stipulated. However, at present, it is quite difficult to achieve this, because the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the masses are too high. Wu Linfang of Jiangzhuang Production Team of Dongsheng Commune in Dongguang County, Hebei Province, is already sixty-three years old. On the public holiday stipulated by the team, he secretly put on the harrows and went to the field before dawn. It is said that there are more than thirty people like him in the whole team. May I ask, for such tirelessly selfless working heroic people, shouldn't we doubly care about their lives, care about their bodies, and even force them to rest? Isn't the willingness to do so a test of the strength of the mass viewpoint of every leader?

　　Of course, our emphasis on letting the masses rest well does not mean that we do not want hard struggle or leap forward. On the contrary, it is for better hard struggle and a greater leap forward. It should be stated that in our country, which is poor and blank, and has a very weak foundation, it is completely necessary and correct to organize the masses to engage in hard struggle within a certain period of time; without this, we cannot quickly change the backward face of our country and enable the people to live a happy life sooner. However, if we say that we cannot rest well if we want to struggle hard, then this is not right. The so-called hard struggle means that when fighting, we must work hard and specially hard, we must not fear difficulties, we must not avoid dangers, and we must win the battle if we fight. However, if we do not follow each tense battle with appropriate rest and recuperation to allow the masses to recover from fatigue, but instead one-sidedly emphasize increasing labor intensity and prolonging labor time, and continue this day after day, it will exhaust the masses and make them unable to fight again, or at least affect labor efficiency. The employees of the Laishui Iron Factory in Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, always failed to complete the task of producing 100 tons of pig iron per day when they were struggling hard day and night. After the leaders paid attention to letting the masses rest well, although the working time was shortened by a quarter, the daily output of iron increased by 70%, and the task was overfulfilled. This example best illustrates that it is wrong to only struggle hard and not rest. Because people's energy is always limited, labor consumes their energy, and rest and replenishment are needed. It is absolutely impossible to only spend without income. Only by resting well can we work well, and only then can hard struggle achieve greater results. Isn't this very clear? Experienced leaders understand this principle. They are good at using the gap between the two climaxes for recuperation. The purpose of doing so is, on the one hand, to restore the physical strength of the masses so that the masses can maintain normal production; at the same time, it is also to more fully mobilize the masses, sum up the experiences and lessons of the previous climax, study strategic tactics, improve the leadership style and leadership methods, and improve labor organization and labor management. What they do is completely correct, in line with the laws of the development of mass movements and production movements, the enthusiasm of the masses is even higher, and their energy is more abundant, so that production and construction develop rapidly from one climax to another, and from one wave to another.

　　Next year is a decisive year for three years of hard struggle. The Party requires us to carry out larger-scale mass movements, organize greater production upsurges, and achieve greater achievements in production and construction. To achieve this goal, correctly grasping and adjusting the relationship between labor and rest, hard struggle and recuperation is of great significance. I hope that the leading comrades in every place can earnestly summarize the experience of leading mass movements and correctly solve this problem. Our cause is long-term, and we must not damage long-term interests and the entire cause because we are not good at organizing necessary recuperation.

    苦战与休整
    石子侃
    党和毛主席经常教导我们，观察和处理问题，要用两点论，既要看到事物的这一方面，也要看到事物的那一方面，诸如多和少，快和慢，先进和落后，有利和不利等等。只有这样辩证地观察问题，才能对事物有全面的认识，而不致在工作中犯片面性的错误。在当前劳动和休息、苦战与休整的关系问题上，自然也应该这样。它们是对立的，又是统一的。把这两个方面调节好，生产建设就能有节奏地前进，建设的速度就能不断的提高。
    一年多来，我国的工业、农业和其他各项建设事业，都获得了空前未有的大发展，成绩是极其伟大的。这种奇迹的出现，原因固然很多，但是最根本的，还是我国广大劳动人民在党的领导下，解放了思想，提高了觉悟，发挥了冲天的干劲。他们不分日夜地苦战鏖战，劳动不计报酬，不计时间，哪里需要就到哪里去，要劳动多长时间就劳动多长时间。他们所想的不是什么安逸和休息，更不是什么工资和劳动日，而是一心一意地为着早日建成社会主义。面对着这样的情况，作为一个领导者，就应当是一方面继续发扬群众的冲天干劲，鼓舞他们创造更大的奇迹，不使他们的劳动积极性受到半点的挫折。这是党和人民所需要的，绝大多数的领导者也是这样作的。另一方面，领导者也就更要关心群众的生活，要爱护他们的身体，保证使他们在紧张地劳动之后有一定的休息，苦战之后有一定的休整。只有这样正确地把劳动和休息、苦战与休整结合起来，才能使群众长久地保持高涨的热情，才能使群众有充沛的劳力，从而使我们的事业经常高速度地前进。然而不能不指出，对于后一方面，有些地方的领导者却注意不够，有少数同志还持有异议。他们说，不是要苦战吗，为什么又强调让人们休息好呢？现在这样昼夜苦战，活儿还干不完呢，要是再让人们多休息，不就更完不成任务了吗，那还怎样跃进呢？其实，只要冷静地全面地思索一下，同群众商量一番，这些问题是容易弄明白的。
    人们知道，我们党从来关心群众的生活，任何时候都注意把群众的眼前利益同长远利益结合起来，把群众的生活同生产适当配合起来。远在1934年，革命斗争还异常艰苦的时候，毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中就曾指出：“我们是革命战争的领导者、组织者，我们又是群众生活的领导者、组织者，组织革命战争，改良群众生活，这是我们的两大任务。”党和毛主席所以这样关心群众的生活，这样关心人的工作，是因为人是历史的创造者，是最重要的生产力，是我们伟大事业的决定因素。没有人，没有生产，也就没有了一切。因此，关心人和关心生产是完全一致的；而且要关心生产，就必须首先关心人，而关心人，也正是为了关心生产。怎样关心人呢？这就要正确掌握人们的生活规律，即劳动——休息——劳动，并按着这个规律，组织群众进行生产。具体说，就是要像许多地方规定的那样，在一般情况下，要保证群众每天有八小时的睡眠时间，要规定必要的公休日，使群众有料理个人私事的时间。然而，在目前，要作到这一点是颇不容易的，因为群众的政治热情和劳动积极性太高了。河北省东光县东升公社姜庄生产队的吴林芳，已经是六十三岁的人了，在队里规定的公休日，他也天不明就偷偷地套上耠子下了地。据说像他这样的人，全队就有三十多个。试问，对于这样不知疲倦地忘我劳动的英雄人民，我们还不应当加倍地关心他们的生活，关心他们的身体，甚至强迫他们休息吗？愿不愿意这样作，难道不是对每个领导者的群众观点强弱的考验吗？
    当然，我们强调要让群众休息好，并不是不要苦战，不要跃进，恰恰相反，是为了更好的苦战和更大的跃进。应当说明，在我们一穷二白、底子很薄的国家里，在一定时期内组织群众进行苦战，这是完全必要的和正确的；不如此，就不能迅速改变我们国家的落后面貌，不能使人民更快地过幸福的生活。但是，如果说要苦战就不能休息好，这就不对了。所谓苦战，就是在战的时候，要大干、特干，要不畏困难，不避艰险，不战则已，战就要胜。但是，在每一次紧张的战斗之后，如果不继之以适当的休息和休整，使群众恢复疲劳，反而片面地强调提高劳动强度、延长劳动时间，这样日复一日地延续下去，就会使群众精疲力竭，无力再战，至少会影响劳动效率。河北省涿县涞水铁厂的职工，在昼夜苦战的时候，总是完不成日产生铁一百吨的任务。而在领导者注意了让群众休息好之后，虽然工作时间缩短了四分之一，铁的日产量却提高了70％，超额完成了任务。这个例子最好不过地说明了，只要苦战，不要休息的作法是不对的。因为人的精力总是有限的，劳动耗费了他们的精力，就需要休息和补充，只有支出，而没有收入，这是无论如何不行的。只有休息好，才能劳动好，才能使苦战收到更大的效果，这难道不是很清楚的吗？有经验的领导者，是懂得这个道理的，他们善于利用两个高潮之间的空隙进行休整。他们这样做的目的，一方面是为了恢复群众的体力，使群众能坚持正常的生产；同时也是为了更充分地发动群众，总结前一个高潮中的经验教训，学习研究战略战术，改进领导作风和领导方法，改进劳动组织和劳动管理。他们这样作是完全正确的，符合于群众运动和生产运动发展的规律，群众的热情更加高涨，精力更加充沛，从而生产建设一个高潮接着一个高潮，一个浪头高过一个浪头地迅速向前发展。
    明年是苦战三年的决定性的一年，党要求我们开展更大规模的群众运动，组织更大的生产高潮，在生产建设上取得更大的成绩。而要达到这样的目的，正确地掌握和调节劳动和休息、苦战和休整之间的关系，具有重大的意义。希望每个地方的领导同志都能认真地总结领导群众运动的经验，正确地解决这个问题。我们的事业是长期的，我们一定不要因为不善于组织必要的休整而损害长远的利益，损害整个的事业。
