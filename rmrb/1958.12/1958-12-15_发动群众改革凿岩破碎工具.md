Editorial: Launch the Masses to Reform Rock Drilling and Crushing Tools

The magnificent mass movement for steel production has increased China's steel production capacity by leaps and bounds. However, the preparation of raw materials and fuel for iron smelting and steel rolling capacity are relatively lagging behind. "Large in the middle, small at both ends" has become the main problem in steel production. Why is the preparation of raw materials and fuel for iron smelting lagging behind? This is because rock drilling, crushing, and transportation work are still mainly done by manual labor, lacking machinery and equipment, thus occupying a lot of manpower, but the production efficiency is very low. According to estimates from various sources, about half of the nation's 60 million steel production army is engaged in rock drilling, crushing, and transportation, most of which is used for transportation. We will make a special explanation about transportation in the future. Here, we will focus on rock drilling and crushing. In this aspect, the manpower occupied is also considerable. In general areas, using manual drilling, three people can only drill a little more than one meter a day. Using manual crushing, one person can only crush about 300 kilograms of ore a day. It is estimated that at present, more than 10 million people are engaged in rock drilling and crushing.

In order to rapidly develop the "small-scale native furnace groups" iron smelting movement, we invested more labor in mining and the crushing of smelting raw materials in the previous period, which was necessary and correct. Without paying such a labor cost at that time, it would not be possible to ensure the raw materials needed by the steel industry, and it would not be possible to ensure the great leap forward in industry with steel as the key link. On this point, we are different from those opponents who have always believed that labor productivity is too low and that too much manpower is used, and who attempt to negate the "small-scale native furnace groups" policy. However, we must see that after several months of universal development, the small-scale native furnace groups' steel industry movement has entered a stage of consolidation and improvement. At this time, it would be wrong to remain at the original level. In the future, the steel industry will continue to develop on a large scale. If we still follow the past methods and transfer more labor from the existing industrial and agricultural production teams for a long time, it will obviously exacerbate the labor shortage, and at the same time, it will not be able to fully guarantee the supply of raw materials and fuel for iron smelting. Therefore, how to improve the labor productivity of rock drilling and crushing work and liberate a large number of laborers has become a major issue of strategic significance for further promoting the mass steel production movement and adjusting the allocation of industrial and agricultural labor.

Regarding how to reform rock drilling and crushing tools, the masses have already made many creations in production practice. According to the recent experience exchange meeting on rock drilling and crushing held by the Science and Technology Commission in conjunction with the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building, these mass creations can be summarized into three categories. The first category is the improvement of native tools, such as the "hanging bow flying hammer" created by Li Village Township in Yanshi County, Henan Province, which requires only 10 to 50 yuan in investment, operated by four people, and can crush more than 10,000 catties of ore a day, increasing efficiency by 10 to 20 times compared with manual labor. The hydraulic crusher in Bobai County, Guangxi, uses a wooden water turbine to drive several wooden pestles to crush ore, replacing the physical labor of hundreds of people. The hanging hammer drilling and hand-cranked and foot-pedaled drills used in many places are also very good. The second category is simple equipment combining native and foreign methods. For example, Yingkou City created a wooden ore pounding machine that can replace the operation of 260 people. Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory has manufactured two kinds of small simple rock drills, costing only 40 to 50 yuan. Anhui University of Technology has created a hand-cranked electric dual-purpose jaw crusher. Two people cranking can crush 300 to 400 kilograms of ore per hour, which is 10 times faster than manual crushing. As for the simple jaw crushers and hammer crushers made in many areas, either using wood instead of iron, using cast iron instead of steel, or piecing together old parts, they are also realistic and feasible and suitable for local conditions. The third category is the adoption of new technologies and new equipment. A type of counterattack crusher manufactured by Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's Beneficiation Research Institute is more efficient than ordinary crushers. The high-speed impact ore crusher manufactured by the Cement Design Institute and Tianjin Fourth Machinery Repair Factory, the internal combustion rock drill and high-frequency rock drill designed by Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, are all relatively new products. Some universities and research institutions are also studying cutting-edge technologies for rock drilling and crushing, such as high-frequency current, high-frequency vibration, and thermal rock drilling, and have achieved certain results.

These creations and improvements by the masses, including the simplest tool improvements, the simplification of existing general-purpose equipment, and the adoption and research of the latest technologies, have utilized the experience accumulated by the Chinese working people for thousands of years, and have also adopted new technological achievements from around the world, from native to foreign, ancient and modern, in a wide variety of ways. Their common feature is that they can solve local specific problems under different conditions. Although some of these experiences may not be fully mature, and some have just been designed and manufactured and have not yet been tested by long-term production, if various regions can adopt and promote them according to different conditions and further improve them on the existing basis, I believe that the best technical path to solve the current rock drilling and crushing problem can be found.

The problem now is that although the masses have already made many creations and improvements, these new methods have not yet been popularized and promoted, and the manual labor state of rock drilling and crushing has basically not changed. Therefore, the current task is to launch a mass movement to improve rock drilling tools and equipment in the industrial technology revolution movement, rely on the infinite wisdom and creative talents of the masses to mobilize forces from all aspects, rapidly change the face of rock drilling and crushing work, improve labor productivity, and liberate labor, so as to adapt to the factory-based and base-based nature of the entire steel production, and ensure that the steel industry has a reliable guarantee of raw materials and fuel.

Improving rock drilling and crushing tools should also be done by using both native and foreign methods, walking on two legs. On the one hand, we must rely on the broad masses to improve the various manual tools and manual machinery currently in use; on the other hand, we must rush to manufacture a batch of rock drilling and crushing machinery and equipment, and organize research and creation of better equipment and rock drilling and crushing methods. At present, the national machinery manufacturing task is very heavy, the supply of raw materials is limited, and electricity is also very tight. It is impossible to completely rely on manufacturing modern equipment to solve the problem. Therefore, every small but realistic improvement to existing tools is of great significance. Improving a tool and increasing efficiency by one or two times means saving tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of laborers for the whole country. According to the experience of various regions, it is not difficult to increase efficiency by one to several times as long as the masses are mobilized to carry out some reforms. Therefore, mobilizing the masses to improve tools should be the focus of our work. However, on the other hand, manufacturing a batch of foreign equipment is not very difficult either. The improved jaw crushers used in many places have a simple structure, mostly using iron and very little steel. General county machinery factories can manufacture them, and the efficiency is also very high. A 28-kilowatt crusher can replace the labor of seven or eight hundred people. Therefore, various regions should use the time this winter and next spring to make overall arrangements based on the local conditions of material, power supply, and equipment manufacturing, and make a concentrated effort to manufacture a batch of rock drilling and crushing equipment.

The problem of rock drilling and crushing is now the most prominent, and in the future, as mines are increasingly mined to deeper depths, transportation, hoisting, drainage and other work will increasingly occupy more labor. Therefore, we can first focus on rock drilling and crushing, and after the problem of rock drilling and crushing is solved to a certain extent, the next step should be to focus on the technical reform of transportation, hoisting, and drainage. Only when these problems are solved can the mining and raw material preparation work be truly improved.

Improving rock drilling and crushing is not only a problem in the steel industry. In non-ferrous metals, cement, coal, as well as railway and highway construction, it is also an extremely weak link. Taking copper as an example, although the output of copper is not as large as that of iron, most copper mines must be crushed, ground, and beneficiated before they can be smelted. Therefore, the amount of crushing and grinding work required is not much less than that of iron ore. Native cement production has blossomed everywhere, and grinding ore is also a major problem. Moreover, in many places, production cannot be organized more because crushing and pulverization have not been resolved. The amount of rock drilling and crushing work in coal mine development and railway and highway construction is also very large. Therefore, solving the problem of rock drilling and crushing is also the common task of these departments. We must quickly mobilize forces from all aspects and work together to launch a mass movement to improve rock drilling and crushing.

    发动群众改革凿岩破碎工具
    波澜壮阔的全民办钢铁运动，使我国钢铁生产能力一日千里地增长。但炼铁原料、燃料的准备及轧钢能力则比较落后。中间大，两头小已经成为钢铁生产中的主要问题。炼铁原料及燃料准备工作为什么落后呢？这是因为凿岩、破碎及运输工作还主要是靠手工劳动，缺少机器设备，因而占用人力很多，但生产效率很低。根据各方面估计，全国六千万钢铁生产大军中约有一半左右的人力是在做凿岩、破碎和运输工作，其中大部分又用于运输工作。关于运输方面的问题，我们将在今后作专门的阐述。这里只着重谈谈凿岩与破碎工作。在这方面，占用的人力也是不少的。一般地区用人工打眼，三个人一天只能打一公尺多。用人力破碎，一人一天只能破碎矿石三百公斤左右。据估算，目前光是从事凿岩破碎工作的，就有一千多万人。
    为了使“小土群”的炼铁运动迅速开展起来，我们前一时期在矿山及冶炼原料破碎上投入了较多的劳动力，这是必要的，也是正确的。当时不付出这样的劳动代价就不能保证钢铁工业所需要的原料，也就无法保证以钢为纲的工业大跃进。在这一点上，我们与那些一直认为劳动生产率太低，用人力过多而企图否定“小土群”方针的反对派是不同的。但是，我们不能不看到，小土群的钢铁工业运动，经过几个月的普遍发展，已经进入巩固和提高的阶段。在这个时候，如果仍停留在原来的水平上，就不对了。今后钢铁工业还要大量发展，如果我们仍按照过去的办法，将更多的劳动力从现有工农业生产队伍中长期抽调出来，显然将加剧劳动力的紧张局面，同时也不能充分保证炼铁原料和燃料的供应。因而现在如何设法提高凿岩破碎工作的劳动生产率，把大批劳动力解放出来，就已经成为进一步推动全民办钢铁运动和调剂工农业劳力安排的一个具有战略意义的重大问题。
    如何改革凿岩破碎工具，广大群众在生产实践中也已经有了许多创造。根据最近科学技术委员会会同冶金部、第一机械部召开的凿岩破碎经验交流会反映，这些群众性的创造归纳起来主要有三类。第一类是土工具的改良，如河南偃师县李村乡创造的“吊弓飞锤”，只要一二十元到四五十元投资，四人操作，一日可碎矿一万多斤，比人工效率提高一二十倍。广西博白县的水力破碎机，用木制水轮机带动若干木碓臼捣矿，代替了几百人的体力劳动。很多地方使用的吊锤打眼和手摇脚踏钻机等也都很好。第二类是土洋结合的简易设备。如营口市创造了一种木制捣矿机，可代替二百六十人的操作。沈阳风动工具厂制成两种小型简易凿岩机，造价只四五十元。安徽工业大学创造了手摇电动两用颚式破碎机，两人摇动，每小时可碎矿三百至四百公斤，比手碎快十倍。至于很多地区制成的简易颚式破碎机、锤式破碎机，或是以木代铁，以铸铁代钢，或是以旧零件拼凑制成，也都现实可行，适合当地情况。第三类是采用新的技术与新的设备。上海矿山机械厂及冶金部选矿研究院制造的一种反击式破碎机，效率比一般破碎机都大。水泥设计院和天津第四机械修配厂制造的高速冲击碎矿机、沈阳风动工具厂设计的内燃式凿岩机和高频率凿岩机，都是比较新的产品。还有些大学与研究机关正在研究高频率电流、高频率振动、热力凿岩等凿岩破碎的尖端技术，并已取得一定结果。
    广大群众的这些创造改进，包括最简单的工具改良、现行通用设备的简化、和最新技术的采用与研究，运用了我国劳动人民千百年积累起来的经验，也采用了世界上新的技术成就，从土到洋，中外古今，花样极多。它们的共同特点是都可以针对不同条件解决当地具体问题。这些经验，虽然有的并不一定十分成熟，有的还是刚刚设计制造出来尚未经过长期生产的考验，但各地如能根据不同条件采用推广，并在现有基础上再加改进，相信一定可以找到解决目前凿岩破碎问题最好的技术道路。
    现在的问题是群众虽然已经有了许多创造改进，但这些新的方法还远未普及推广，凿岩破碎的手工劳动状态基本还未改变。因而，当前的任务就是要在工业技术革命运动中掀起一个改进凿岩工具设备的群众运动，依靠群众的无穷智慧和创造才能把各方面的力量动员起来，迅速改变凿岩破碎工作的面貌，提高劳动生产率，解放劳动力，以便与整个钢铁生产的工厂化基地化相适应，使钢铁工业有可靠的原料燃料保证。
    改进凿岩破碎工具，也应当是土洋并举，两条腿走路。一方面要依靠广大群众改良现在使用的各种手工工具和手工机械；另一方面要赶制出一批凿岩破碎机器设备，并组织研究与创造更好的设备和凿岩破碎方法。目前全国机械制造任务很重，原材料供应有一定限度，电力也很紧张，要完全依靠制造现代化设备解决问题是不可能的。因而对现有工具的每一件细小但现实可行的改进都有极大意义。改良一下工具，提高效率一倍两倍，对全国来说就是节省几万、几十万以至几百万劳动力的问题。根据各地经验，只要发动群众进行一些改革，提高效率一倍至几倍是并不困难的。所以发动群众改良工具，应当是我们工作的重点。但是，另一方面，制造一批洋设备也不是十分困难的，许多地方使用的改良颚式破碎机，结构简单，大部用铁，极少用钢，一般县里的机械厂都可制造，效率也很高，一台二十八瓩的破碎机，可以代替七八百人的劳动。因而各地区应利用今冬明春这一段时间，根据本地区的材料、动力供应和设备制造等条件，统筹安排，突击制造出一批凿岩破碎设备来。
    凿岩与破碎问题现在最为突出，而今后矿山日渐向深部开采，运搬、提升、排水等工作又将日益占用更多的劳动量。所以目前可先抓凿岩破碎，而在凿岩破碎问题得到一定程度解决之后，下一步就应当抓运搬、提升、排水的技术改革。只有当这些问题都解决了之后，矿山与原料准备工作才算真正提高了一步。
    改进凿岩破碎工作其实不仅是钢铁工业中的问题，在有色金属、水泥、煤炭以及铁路、公路建设中，也都是极为薄弱的环节。以铜为例，铜的产量虽不如铁大，但多数地区的铜矿必须先经破碎磨细选矿才能冶炼，因而所需的破碎磨细工作量并不比铁矿少很多。土法生产水泥已遍地开花，磨矿也是一大问题，而且许多地方正因为破碎粉碎未能解决，不能更多地组织生产。煤矿开采和铁路、公路建设中的凿岩破碎工作量也是很大的。所以，解决凿岩破碎问题也是这些部门的共同任务。必须迅速将各方面力量动员起来，为开展一个改进凿岩破碎的群众运动而共同努力。
