    The Dining Hall is Good
    The dining hall is good, the dining hall is strong,
    The food cooked in the dining hall is fragrant,
    We don't eat the same food on weekdays,
    We eat even better on holidays.
    While eating, while thinking,
    Let's go to the club to sing.

    食堂好
    食堂好、食堂强，
    食堂做的饭菜香，
    平日不吃重样饭，
    假日吃的更在行。
    一边吃、一边想，
    俱乐部里去唱唱。
          （河北）
