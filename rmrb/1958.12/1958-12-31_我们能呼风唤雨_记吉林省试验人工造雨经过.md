We Can Summon Wind and Rain
A Record of Jilin Province's Experimental Artificial Rainmaking

For many years, our ancestors used myths to express humanity's fantasy of conquering nature – "summoning wind and rain." This fantasy is now beginning to become reality.

This summer, the powerful Western Pacific high-pressure ridge firmly controlled the Jilin area in July and early August, causing Jilin Province to experience one hundred and thirteen days of drought, an unprecedented high-temperature drought. Under the scorching sun, paddy fields cracked, and crop leaves curled up. In order to resolutely fight against "old man heaven," the entire province mobilized millions of people for drought resistance, using every possible means to draw water and irrigate the land.

At this time, the weather station was particularly tense. Every day, many agricultural cooperatives, enterprises, and organizations called or wrote to inquire about the weather situation, and the forecasters felt dissatisfied with their work. Everyone believed that, according to their tasks, providing accurate weather forecasts had already fulfilled their responsibilities. But now is the era of the Great Leap Forward. What good is it to "passively" report the drought? If we could actively change the climate and give people good news, how inspiring that would be! Therefore, they proposed to conduct small-scale artificial rainfall experiments. Under the unified leadership of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Jilin Municipal Party Committee, relevant parties were organized to cooperate. Thus began a march of workers, peasants, and soldiers towards nature!

Ingeniously Making Dry Ice in the Scorching Heat

To "summon wind and rain," the first step is to make dry ice (i.e., solid carbon dioxide). Spreading dry ice on the cloud layer cools the cloud body locally, increases the size of the cloud droplets, and heavy rain will fall. Workers at the nitrogen fertilizer plant undertook the task of making dry ice, taking the lead in attacking the first hurdle of artificial rainfall.

At that time, the dry ice workshop of the nitrogen fertilizer plant was under construction, and many major equipment had not yet been installed. However, when everyone heard that the dry ice produced was to be used for artificial rainfall to support the peasant brothers in fighting drought and saving seedlings, the dry ice workshop boiled over. Many cadres and workers in the workshop were unwilling to go home, and the installation work was completed smoothly. After the installation was completed, they immediately carried out the intense work of filling activated carbon. This work was originally planned to take two or three days, but it was completed in just over six hours. The Soviet expert, Zhichekefu, who was guiding the installation and production work in the workshop, was also very happy to hear the news of the early production of dry ice. He often worked with the workers until late at night. With the strong support of all parties, the dry ice workshop, after seven days and nights of continuous hard work, saw the birth of the first piece of pure white dry ice on August 4th.

Flying General Parts the Clouds to Spread Rain

While the workers at the nitrogen fertilizer plant were trial-producing dry ice, the work of modifying the aircraft was also proceeding intensely.

On the afternoon of August 8th, the artificial rainmaking experiment officially began.

An aircraft carrying dry ice, under the command of Comrade Lu Qiang from the weather station, and piloted by Du Daoshi, navigator Feng Yumin, and communicator Ji Jiaxi, took off into the sky and quickly discovered a white cloud directly ahead. This white cloud rolled forward rapidly, and the aircraft chased it all the way to the sky above Lafa Township, Jiaohe County, finally approaching the cloud body. Now a huge cloud column stood in front of the aircraft, a gourd-shaped cloud column about seven thousand meters thick and twenty to thirty square kilometers in area, commonly known as a "cumulonimbus cloud." Inside this terrifying cumulonimbus layer, the air currents were violently turbulent, and the momentum was fierce. The aircraft had already risen to six thousand meters. "Go in or not?" This question immediately jumped into the minds of the flight crew, and everyone was very nervous. According to flight regulations, aircraft are prohibited from flying through such cloud layers. This is because strong radio waves or lightning may occur here; if the vertical airflow reaches a rise or fall of one to two thousand meters per second, it may even cut off the wings.

The aircraft was rapidly approaching the cloud column. Du Daoshi discussed with his companions while calmly thinking. Based on his rich flying experience, he judged that although the weather was dangerous, there was still a certain degree of certainty. "Go in, only success is allowed, no failure is allowed!" At that moment, he made a decision. The aircraft cleverly entered the cloud layer from the upper front end of the air current, and immediately, like a small boat in a raging storm, it was lifted by atmospheric vortexes, suddenly sank, tossed up and down, and rose and fell sharply. Ice needles outside struck the aircraft, and the fuselage was covered with ice. Wireless telephone communication had already failed. Du Daoshi calmly and forcefully held the steering wheel and ordered, "Scatter!" Communicator Ji Jiaxi opened the hand valve, and a batch of dry ice was scattered into the cloud layer. Then, the aircraft bravely passed through the cloud layer and circled to the waist of the cloud column, continuously scattering one hundred and fifty kilograms of dry ice. In an instant, the white clouds turned black, forming a filamentous state, spreading up and down, and rain streaks appeared under the clouds, making it impossible to see the ground clearly. Heavy rain fell! The flight crew talked and laughed as they flew back to the airport. According to reports from various meteorological stations, the experiment resulted in more than ten minutes of rain, with a rainfall of sixteen millimeters, covering an area of one hundred to two hundred square kilometers.

When the aircraft scattered the dry ice, the farmers in Lafa Xin'an and other townships who were fighting the drought were watering the crops with basins and jars. They heard the sound of the aircraft passing through the sky, and then suddenly it began to rain. They all ran home, enjoying the rain. They were both happy and strange: "This rain is really quenching our thirst, but it's a bit strange: it started small, gradually became bigger, and then gradually became smaller again. The rain is dense, the raindrops are big, the wind is small, the force is weak, and it doesn't damage the seedlings. This rain is really unusual!" While everyone was puzzled, the news came: "The artificial rainfall experiment was a success!" "We can summon wind and rain!"

    我们能呼风唤雨
    记吉林省试验人工造雨经过
    多少年前我们的祖先就曾经借助神话表达出人类征服自然的幻想——“呼风唤雨”。这种幻想今天已开始变为现实。
    今年夏季，势力强大的西太平洋高压脊在7月和8月初牢固地控制着吉林地区，使吉林省出现了一百一十三天的干旱无雨，为几十年未有的高温干旱天气。在烈日曝晒下，水田裂缝，谷叶打卷。为了和“老天爷”作坚决的斗争，全省出动了几百万抗旱大军，用一切办法取水浇地。
    这时，气象台特别紧张。这里，每天有很多农业社、企业、机关打电话或写信来探询气候情况，预报员们对自己工作感到不满。大家认为：按任务来说，做到准确的气象预报，已经完成了应负的责任。可是现在是大跃进的时代，只“消极”地把干旱的气象预报出去，能解决什么问题？如果能积极地改变气候，给人们报个好消息，那该使人多么振奋啊！于是，他们提出要进行小型人工降雨的试验。在中共吉林省委和吉林市委的统一领导下，组织了各有关方面协作进行。一场工农兵向大自然的进军就这样开始了！
    巧化工酷暑做干冰
    要想“呼风唤雨”，首先要做出干冰（即固体二氧化碳）。干冰播撒在云层上，使云体局部冷却，云滴增大，大雨就会倾降下来。氮肥厂工人们担负了做干冰的任务，首先带头攻打人工降雨的第一关。
    当时氮肥厂的干冰车间正处在施工阶段，很多主要设备还没有安装。但是大家听说生产出来的干冰要用作人工降雨，支援农民弟兄抗旱救苗时，干冰车间就沸腾起来。车间很多干部和工人们都不肯回家，安装工程顺利完成后，马上进行紧张的充填活性碳的工作。这工作原计划需要二、三天，结果六个多小时即完成。在车间指导安装和生产工作的苏联专家日切克夫知道提前出干冰的消息，也很高兴，他经常和工人们一起工作到深夜。干冰车间在各方面的大力支援下，经过七昼夜的连续苦战，8月4日第一块洁白的干冰就诞生了。
    飞将军拨云布雨
    当氮肥厂工人试制干冰时，改装飞机的工作也在紧张地进行。
    8月8日下午，人工造雨的试验正式开始。
    一架飞机载着干冰，在气象台鲁强同志的指挥下，由飞行员杜导时、领航员冯玉民、通讯员纪家修等驾驶飞上天去，很快就发现正前方的一朵白云。这块白云迅速地往前汹涌滚动，飞机直追到蛟河县拉法乡上空，终于接近了云身。现在一个巨大云柱耸现在飞机的面前，这是个葫芦形的云柱，厚约七千公尺，方圆约二十到三十平方公里，通常叫做“积雨云”。这个可怕的积云层里，气流正激烈翻滚，气势汹汹。飞机已经上升到六千公尺。“进不进去？”这个问题顿时跳进飞行人员的脑子里，大家十分紧张。按照飞行常例，飞机如果遇到这种云层是禁止穿行的。因为这里可能产生强烈电波，或者发生雷电；垂直气流如果达到每秒升降一千到两千公尺时，还可能把机翼切断。
    飞机正飞快地靠近云柱。杜导时一面和同伴们研究，一面沉着思考。他凭着丰富的飞行经验判断，气候虽然险恶，但还有一定的把握。“钻进去，只许成功，不许失败！”就在这一瞬间他做出了决定。飞机机警地从大气流的前上端钻进云层，顿时像狂风怒涛中的小舟一样，一会被大气流旋涡托起，一会骤然沉下，上下颠簸，急剧地升降着。外面冰针打击着飞机，机身外结着冰层，无线电话的联络已经失灵。杜导时沉着用力把住驾驶盘，下令：“撒！”通讯员纪家修扳开手阀，一批干冰撒入云层。接着，飞机勇敢地穿过云层，又绕到云柱腰部，连续播撒了一百五十公斤干冰。一瞬间，白云变黑，形成丝缕状态，弥漫开来，上下翻滚，云下出现雨幡，已经看不清地面。大雨降下来了！飞行人员们谈笑着飞回机场。据各处气象站报告，这次试验下雨十多分钟，雨量十六公厘，范围一百到二百平方公里。
    当飞机撒下干冰的时候，在拉法新站等乡进行抗旱的农民们，正在一盆一罐地往庄稼上浇水。他们听到飞机声掠过天空，接着就突然下起雨来，都挨着雨淋跑回家去。他们又高兴又奇怪：“这雨下的真解渴，可就是有点蹊跷：它开始时细小，渐渐大了，后来又渐渐变小。雨下的密，雨点子大，风力小，力量弱，不损禾苗，这雨真不一般！”大家正在疑惑不解的时候，消息传来了：“人工降雨试验成功”！“我们能呼风唤雨啦！”
