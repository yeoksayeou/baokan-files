Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 19th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong, the Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting today at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, Major General Kang Sang-ho, chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, severely condemned the U.S. side's blatant violation of the armistice agreement by recently transporting "Matador" missiles into South Korea, and lodged a strong protest to the U.S. side. Kang Sang-ho demanded that the U.S. side immediately stop implementing its war policy in South Korea, dismantle the missile base, immediately remove illegally imported new weapons such as atomic weapons and missile weapons from Korean territory, and immediately withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea.

Kang Sang-ho warned the U.S. side that if it disregards the protests and warnings of the Korean-Chinese side, fails to remove atomic weapons and missile weapons, and continues to adhere to its war policy, the U.S. side will bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

Kang Sang-ho pointed out at the meeting: "This criminal act by the U.S. side is not only a blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also an aggressive act aimed at permanently dividing Korea, hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and seriously threatening peace in the Far East."

Kang Sang-ho said: Today, the Korean people are eager for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and the resolution of the Korean issue is already an imminent and mature matter. However, the U.S. side, which is frantically pursuing war, not only stubbornly refuses to withdraw its aggressive troops from South Korea even after the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, but instead transports missile weapons, frantically creating new obstacles to the resolution of the Korean issue with even more serious criminal acts.

In order to cover up its crimes and evade responsibility, the U.S. side once again repeated hackneyed phrases such as "maintaining a relative balance of military forces" and "for defensive purposes" at the meeting.

Kang Sang-ho immediately and solemnly refuted the U.S. side, saying, what face does the U.S. side have to talk about "relative balance of military forces"? Since the armistice, the Korean People's Army has reduced its forces by 80,000 men, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea. In contrast, the U.S. side has expanded the Rhee Syngman puppet army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions, the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea have been reorganized into atomic units, and various new weapons, including atomic weapons, have been transported into South Korea, and missile bases have been established and missiles have been transported in.

    朝中方面在军事停战委员会上
    抗议美方把导弹运进南朝鲜
    新华社平壤19日电  据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会今天在朝中方面建议下举行了会议。朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在会上严厉谴责美方粗暴地违反停战协定，最近把“斗牛士”式导弹运进南朝鲜的行为，并且向美方提出强硬抗议。姜尚昊要求美方立即停止在南朝鲜实行战争政策，撤销导弹基地，立即从朝鲜境内运出非法运入的原子武器等新型武器和导弹武器，立即使美军撤出南朝鲜。
    姜尚昊警告美方，如果美方不顾朝中方面的抗议和警告，不运出原子武器和导弹武器，继续坚持战争政策，美方就要对由此而引起的一切后果负全部责任。
    姜尚昊在会上指出：“美方这种犯罪行为不仅是对朝鲜停战协定的粗暴违反，而且是企图永久分裂朝鲜、阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决和严重威胁远东和平的侵略行为。”
    姜尚昊说：今天朝鲜人民渴望祖国的和平统一，朝鲜问题的解决已经是刻不容缓的成熟了的问题。但是疯狂地追求战争的美方，在中国人民志愿军全部撤出了朝鲜的今天不仅死命地不肯从南朝鲜撤走它的侵略军队，反而运进导弹武器，以更加严重的犯罪行为来疯狂地制造解决朝鲜问题的新障碍。
    美方为了掩盖它的罪行和逃避罪责，又在会上重复了所谓“维持军事力量相对平衡”和“为了防御的目的”等滥调。
    姜尚昊当即严正驳斥美方说，美方有什么脸面说什么“军事力量的相对平衡”，停战以后，朝鲜人民军已经裁减了八万人，中国人民志愿军已经全部撤出朝鲜。与此相反，美方把李伪军由停战时的十六个师扩充到三十一个师，驻南朝鲜的美军又改编为原子部队，并且把包括原子武器在内的各种新武器运入南朝鲜，并且建立了导弹基地，运进了导弹。
