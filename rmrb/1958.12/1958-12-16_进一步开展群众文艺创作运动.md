Further Develop the Mass Literary and Artistic Creation Movement
Shi Ximin, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Editor's Note: Since the spring of this year, with the great leap forward in national production and construction, mass literary and artistic creation activities have also flourished. Many provinces and cities have explored some experiences in carrying out this work. Here, we publish the article by Comrade Shi Ximin, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and comrades in charge of this work in some factories, government agencies, and enterprises in Shanghai, discussing the experience of carrying out the mass literary and artistic creation movement, which can be used as a reference for carrying out this work.

Shanghai's mass literary and artistic creation movement has developed under the impetus of the great national rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward. From the beginning of spring to July and August this year, the number of mass creations reached five million, the most prominent of which were new folk songs. The working people of Shanghai excitedly wrote countless poems, clappers, and Yangliuqing tunes, enthusiastically praising the Party and Chairman Mao, praising the General Line, and expressing their heroic spirit on the production front in a bold manner. Their works vividly and purely reflect the features of the great era.

The vigorous development of mass literary and artistic creation is closely linked to mass literary and artistic activities. They wrote, composed, played, and sang themselves, and a powerful mass literary and artistic propaganda army emerged at this time. Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, they actively engaged in combat with literature and art as weapons in the propaganda movement of the General Line for socialist construction, in the struggle against the expansion of aggression by American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area, and in a series of struggles such as industrial drought resistance and the national steelmaking campaign. Each mobilization involved more than 400,000 to 500,000 people. Many districts, counties, and large enterprises began to create their own literary and artistic publications, and various literary and artistic wall newspapers were too numerous to count.

While the mass literary and artistic creation movement was developing vigorously, the professional literary and artistic teams in Shanghai also underwent profound changes. More than 100 professional literary workers, after rectification, walked out of their narrow circles of life and plunged into the boiling torrent of life in various forms. Many troupes put forward the six-sided slogan of performing, creating, tutoring, laboring, propagandizing, and studying simultaneously. Like the mass literary and artistic teams, they enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and plunged into the struggle. Some picked up pens to write poems and leaflets, and short stories; some performed in factories and rural areas, and some helped the masses paint murals. These activities of the professional literary and artistic teams encouraged the enthusiasm of the working people in production and educated themselves. New types of art films with various styles, such as "Steel Men and Iron Horses," "Giant Waves," and "Huang Baomei," began to appear on the screen, as well as films such as "Ode to the Red Flag" that closely cooperated with the Great Leap Forward. Literary and artistic publications and publishing houses in Shanghai also began to organize and select a large number of works by the working people. The mass creative upsurge within the professional literary and artistic teams was also unprecedentedly high, and the number of various works broke historical records. All of this shows that the Party's leadership over literature and art has been strengthened, the policy of popularizing literature and art and the policy of serving politics and production have been implemented. At the same time, a path to solving the combination of professional literary workers with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the combination of mass creation and professional creation has begun to be explored, thus creating an exciting mass literary and artistic movement in Shanghai.

After August, the mass creation movement began to enter a new stage, characterized by the requirement for improvement. Clapper poems and Yangliuqing tunes could no longer meet the needs of the masses. At the same time, the working people increasingly demanded more works with higher ideological and artistic qualities. For example, employees in Shanghai's commerce and shipping industries were very dissatisfied with the weakness of literary and artistic works reflecting their lives in recent years. The only works available, such as "Seeking Love" and "Night Voyage in the Fog," damaged their image and distorted their lives to varying degrees. For example, the workers of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant fought day and night in front of the steelmaking furnace. Every victory required the creative cadres who participated in labor in that workshop to write about their struggle. In professional literary and artistic groups, there was also an urgent situation in which the number of mass creations was increasing, but works with a certain quality level were far from meeting the needs of performances.

In fact, the question raised by the masses is how to improve on the basis of giving priority to popularization. Popularization and improvement are opposed but unified. Timely and correct resolution of this issue involves meeting the demands of the masses, the sustained implementation of the policy of giving priority to popularization, and is also conducive to cultivating a group of literary and artistic teams of the working class in the process of continuous popularization and continuous improvement. In August, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that the whole Party should grasp literary and artistic creation as the central link in artistic activities. It pointed out that it is necessary to launch mass creation and, on this basis, put forward the requirements for key creation. For this purpose, the Municipal Party Committee issued a call to Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai at the end of September, putting forward the tasks of mass creation and key creation. On the one hand, it called on factories, enterprises, rural areas, troops, shops, schools, government agencies, and organizations to continue to mobilize the masses to write "Ten Years of Shanghai's Liberation" and "One Day of Shanghai's Great Leap Forward." On the other hand, it required mobilizing and organizing the masses and cadres in active service with creative conditions not only to write short and concise works such as poems and essays, but also to write large-scale works that can more centrally summarize the features of the era, and learn to walk on two legs. The Municipal Party Committee required Party organizations at all levels to determine personnel, topics, and schedules to grasp key creation, and break all mysterious views on writing large-scale works.

As of now, many units have responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee, and under the leadership of the Party in each unit, a new wave of creation has been set off, especially a wave of organizing key creations. According to preliminary statistics, about 600 literary works have been included in the plan and have begun to be written. The themes cover all fronts widely, and the participants include workers, peasants, the masses, veteran cadres, and professional writers. The enthusiasm for writing is very strong. In the units that have done a good job, the Party leaders personally participate in writing and some personally study the theme with the creation team. Now it can be said that under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, an unusually broad literary and artistic creation movement has been truly organized.

In order to adapt to the new situation of the literary and artistic creation movement, the Shanghai Municipal and District (County) levels have formed leading groups for key literary and artistic creation. The primary task of the leading group is to help those who are trying to write for the first time overcome the difficulties in creation. They have held literary writing lectures, spending half a month to complete the basic knowledge of how to write movies, dramas, and novels. At the same time, they help professional literary workers to rationally arrange time in factories and rural areas to comprehensively complete the tasks of participating in labor, transforming their thinking, providing guidance, and engaging in creation. At present, a group of professional writers staying in Shanghai have taken on certain positions in factories or people's communes, such as deputy factory director, deputy minister of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee and the Trade Union, and clerk. This can not only strengthen the unit's Party organization's care and help for them, but also be more conducive to the guidance work and the mutual combination of professional and amateur creation.

Another important task of the Party's Literary and Artistic Creation Leading Group is to organize various concerts, joint performances, exhibitions, and readings of mass-created works, continuously grasping clues from the ocean of mass creation, and fertilizing and processing them in a timely manner, and mobilizing film directors, literary publishing houses, and magazine editors to invest in the work of key guidance of mass works. Strive to have a better literary and artistic creation harvest in the first half of next year.

The mass literary and artistic creation in Shanghai is developing forward, and there are still many difficulties ahead. First of all, the production task is urgent, and it is very difficult to squeeze out spare time. At the same time, the development of the literary and artistic creation movement is still very uneven. The problems facing Party organizations at all levels are: the mutual promotion of key creation and mass creation, and the better combination of political thought and artistic skills in the works, which need to be solved in practice, and we still lack leadership experience. However, judging from the existing situation, the potential of mass creation is great and the enthusiasm is high. As long as the leadership of Party organizations at all levels is strengthened, and the three combinations of the masses, cadres, and professional literary and artistic workers are truly achieved, all difficulties can be gradually overcome. The heroic working people can use their own hands to create huge material wealth for the people of the motherland, and they will certainly be able to use their own hands to write the newest and most beautiful literary and artistic works.

    进一步开展群众文艺创作运动
    中共上海市委宣传部部长  石西民
    编者按：今年入春以来，随着全国生产建设事业的大跃进，群众文艺创作活动也蓬勃展开了。许多省市在开展这个工作方面，都摸索到了一些经验。在这里，我们发表了上海市委宣传部长石西民同志和上海市一部分工厂、机关、企业的负责这方面工作的同志谈开展群众文艺创作运动经验的文章，可以作为开展这一工作的参考。
    上海的群众文艺创作运动，是在伟大的全民整风运动和大跃进的推动激荡之下发展起来的。在今年春夏之交开始到七、八月间，群众创作的数量达到五百万篇，其中最突出的是新民歌。上海的劳动人民激动地写出了无数诗篇、快板、杨柳青调，热情地歌颂党和毛主席，歌颂总路线，豪迈地表达了他们在生产战线上的英雄气概。他们的作品，纯朴而鲜明地反映了伟大时代的风貌。
    群众文艺创作的蓬勃开展是与群众文艺活动紧密结合在一起的。他们自编自写自拉自唱，一支声势浩大的群众文艺宣传大军，就在这个时候出现。他们在各级党组织的领导之下，无论在社会主义建设总路线的宣传运动中，在反对美帝国主义扩大台湾海峡地区侵略的斗争中以及在工业抗旱、全民炼钢等一系列斗争中，用文艺为武器积极地投入了战斗，每一次出动人数都在四五十万人以上。许多区县和大企业开始创办自己的文艺刊物，各种文艺墙报更是多得不可胜计。
    在群众文艺创作运动蓬勃发展的同时，上海专业的文艺队伍也起了深刻的变化。一百多个专业文学工作者，经过整风，走出了狭小的生活圈子，以不同形式投入沸腾的生活洪流中去。许多剧团提出了边演出、边创作、边辅导、边劳动、边宣传、边学习的六边口号。他们也同群众文艺队伍一样，热烈地响应党的号召，投身到斗争中去。有的拿起笔写诗传单，写小小说；有的到工厂农村演出，有的帮助群众画壁画。专业文艺队伍的这些活动，鼓舞了劳动人民的生产积极性，也教育了他们自己。银幕上开始出现了像“钢人铁马”“巨浪”“黄宝妹”等多种风格的新型艺术片，出现了“红旗颂”那样紧密配合大跃进的影片。上海各个文艺刊物和文艺出版社，也开始大量组织和选登劳动人民的作品。专业文艺队伍内部的群众性创作热潮也空前高涨起来，各种作品的数量，打破历年纪录。所有这一切，都说明了：党对文艺的领导加强了，文艺大普及的方针和文艺为政治、为生产服务的方针已经贯彻下去。同时，也开始摸出了一条解决专业文艺工作者与工农兵相结合、群众创作与专业创作相结合的道路，从而在上海出现了令人兴奋的群众性的文艺运动的热潮。
    到8月以后，群众创作运动开始进入一个新的阶段，特点是要求有所提高，老是快板诗、杨柳青调已不能满足群众的需要，同时劳动人民也越来越要求更多地出现思想性艺术性较高的作品。例如上海商业、航运方面的职工，他们非常不满意近几年来反映他们生活的文艺作品的贫弱状态，仅有的如“寻爱记”“雾海夜航”等又都在不同程度上损害了他们的形象，歪曲了他们的生活。又如上海钢铁厂的工人，昼夜奋战在炼钢炉前，每一次胜利，总要求下放在那个车间参加劳动的创作干部写出他们的战斗。在专业文艺团体里，也发生了一方面是群众创作的数量在增加，而有一定质量水平的作品又远远不能适应演出需要的紧迫情况。
    实际上，群众所提出的问题是一个在普及为主的基础上如何提高的问题。普及和提高是对立的而又是统一的。及时而正确解决这个问题，涉及群众要求的满足，大普及方针的持久贯彻执行，同时也有利于在不断普及又不断提高的过程中，培养出一批工人阶级的文艺队伍来。8月间中共上海市委提出了全党抓文艺创作这个艺术活动的中心环节。指出了既要发动群众性的创作，又要在这个基础上提出重点创作的要求。本着这个目的，市委于9月末向上海各级党组织发出了号召，提出群众创作和重点创作两个方面的任务，一方面号召各工厂、企业、农村、部队、商店、学校、机关团体继续发动群众写“上海解放十年”和“上海大跃进的一日”，另一方面要求发动和组织群众以及有创作条件的在职干部不仅要写诗歌，写散文等短小精悍的作品，而且还要写更能集中概括时代面貌的大型作品，学会用两条腿走路。市委要求各级党组织定人、定题、定期地抓重点创作，打破一切对写大型作品的神秘观点。
    截至目前为止，许多单位已经响应了市委的号召，在各单位党的领导之下，掀起了新的创作热潮，特别是组织重点创作的热潮。据初步统计已列入计划并且已开始写作的，已有文学作品六百部左右。题材面广泛地包括了所有战线，参加写作的有工农群众，老干部和专业作家。写作的热情非常旺盛。做得好的单位，党的负责人有的亲自参加写作，有的亲自同创作组共同研究主题。现在可以说，在各级党组织的领导之下，一个异常广泛的文艺创作运动是真正组织起来了。
    为了适应文艺创作运动的新形势，上海市、区（县）两级组成了重点文艺创作的领导小组。领导小组的首要任务是帮助初次尝试写作的人克服创作中的困难，举办了文艺写作讲座，以半个月时间，讲完怎样写电影，写戏剧，写小说等基本常识。同时帮助专业文学工作者在工厂、农村中合理安排时间，全面完成参加劳动、改造思想、进行辅导、从事创作的任务。目前留在上海的一批专业作家都分别担任了工厂或人民公社的一定职务，如副厂长、党委和工会的宣传部副部长、干事等。这样做既能加强单位党组织对他们的关心和帮助，而且也更有利于辅导工作的进行和专业与业余创作的相互结合。
    党的文艺创作领导小组的另一重要工作是组织各种演唱、会演、展览和阅读群众创作的作品，不断从群众创作的海洋中抓苗头，及时培土施肥加工，动员电影编导、文艺出版社和刊物的编辑，投入重点辅导群众作品的工作中去。力求在明年上半年有一个较好的文艺创作丰收。
    上海群众性的文艺创作是在向前发展着，眼前的困难仍然是很多的。首先是生产任务紧迫，挤出业余时间是很不容易的，同时文艺创作运动的发展也还很不平衡。摆在各级党组织面前的问题是：重点创作与群众创作的相互推动，作品的政治思想与艺术技巧的更好结合，都有待于在实践中去求得解决，而我们还缺乏领导经验。可是，从已有情况看来，群众创作的潜力是很大的，积极性是高的。只要各级党的领导加强了，真正做到群众、干部、专业文艺工作者三结合，一切困难都是可以逐步克服的。英雄的劳动人民能用自己的双手为祖国人民创造巨大的物质财富，他们也一定能用他们自己的手写出最新最美的文艺作品来的。
