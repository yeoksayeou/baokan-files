    American Soldiers in Turkey
    Colonel Duris received a report from the General Staff,
    Talking about how young Bill spent Sunday in Istanbul;
    The Colonel immediately shouted loudly for Bill to be summoned,
    And a pockmarked, tall fellow came before the Colonel.
    “Who was it that roared at the gambling table in the coffee shop at night?
    Who was it that entangled and fooled around with Turkish girls?
    Was it you? Answer truthfully at once.”
    Bill admitted in a low voice, his heart jumping with fear.
    “Who put out a cigarette on an old man's head,
    And spat on his face?
    Who told the police he didn't care about the law at all?”
    “It was me,” Bill nodded uneasily.
    “Shaking an empty wine bottle in the street, asking pedestrians for wine,
    And when he couldn't get it, swinging the bottle and beating people until they were bleeding;
    Was this you? Answer quickly!”
    “It was me, it was me,” Bill answered, feeling truly worried.
    “Hero! Hero! Our conversation will pause here,
    My brave young man, a true American soldier!”
    The Colonel hugged the pockmarked fellow and kissed his face again and again,
    And gave Bill another three weeks of vacation to have fun.

    美国兵在土耳其
    杜里斯上校收到参谋本部报告一篇，
    谈到小伙子比尔怎样在伊斯坦布尔过星期天；
    上校马上高声喊叫把比尔召见，
    于是一个麻脸的高个子来到上校面前。
    “是谁晚上在咖啡店赌桌边怪声高叫？
    是谁和土耳其姑娘纠缠胡闹？
    是不是你？赶快从实回答。”
    比尔低声承认，吓得心里直跳。
    “是谁在老人脑瓜上按灭纸烟，
    还用唾沫吐得他一脸？
    是谁向警察讲他根本不在乎法律？”
    “是我。”比尔不安地把头一点。
    “手摇空酒瓶在街头向行人要酒，
    讨不到手就挥舞酒瓶把人打得头破血流；
    这是不是你？赶快回答！”
    “是我，是我。”比尔回答时心里着实担忧。
    “好汉！好汉！我们的谈话到此暂停，
    我勇敢的小伙子，真正的美国大兵！”
    上校抱住麻子把他的脸亲了又亲，
    而且再给三星期假期让比尔开开心。
