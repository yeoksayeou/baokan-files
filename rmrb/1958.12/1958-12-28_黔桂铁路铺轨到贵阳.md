Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 27th. The Duyun-Guiyang section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway was paved to Guiyang Freight Station on the 25th. After paving another eight kilometers to Guiyang Passenger Station around New Year's Day, the paving project of the 605-kilometer-long Guizhou-Guangxi Railway can be declared completed ahead of schedule.

On the 25th, the first train carrying more than 240 tons of materials drove into Guiyang's first station - Guiyang South Station. It transported cotton from Hubei, bacterial fertilizer from Nanjing, daily necessities from Shanghai, sodium nitrate from Jilin, and steel and machinery urgently needed by Guizhou.

The completion of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway will further strengthen the connection between Guizhou and other provinces, creating favorable conditions for the development of industrial and agricultural production in Guizhou Province. Taking the Duyun-Guiyang section as an example, after the railway is in normal operation, each train can pull 1,280 tons of materials, which is equivalent to the carrying capacity of 365 trucks with a load of 3.5 tons; 25 pairs of freight trains and 5 pairs of passenger trains can pass through every 24 hours.

The arrival of the train made Guiyang South Station extremely lively. In the temporary unloading yard, more than 100 workers from the Guiyang City Transportation Company and more than 60 cadres from the Commercial Department were happily unloading goods. Listening to the whistle of the train, the masses came to visit in groups, excitedly discussing: The train we have been waiting for for many years has arrived today, full of happiness.

    黔桂铁路铺轨到贵阳
    新华社贵阳27日电  黔桂铁路都匀—贵阳段，25日铺轨到贵阳货车站。元旦前后，再往前铺轨八公里到贵阳客车站以后，全长六百零五公里的黔桂铁路铺轨工程就可宣告提前完成。
    25日这天，载着二百四十多吨物资的第一列火车，驶进了贵阳的第一个车站——贵阳南站。它运来了湖北的棉花、南京的细菌肥料、上海的日用百货、吉林的硝酸钠以及贵州急需的钢材、机器等物资。
    黔桂铁路全线修成，将使贵州和省外各地的联系进一步密切，为发展贵州省工农业生产创造了有利条件。以都匀至贵阳段来说，到铁路营运正常以后，每列火车可以牵引一千二百八十吨物资，相当于三百六十五辆载重三吨半的汽车的运力；每二十四小时可通过货运列车二十五对，客运列车五对。
    火车的到来，使得贵阳南站热闹异常。临时的卸料场上，贵阳市搬运公司的一百多工人和商业厅来的六十多个干部，都兴高采烈地卸货。群众听着汽笛的鸣叫，成群结队地前来参观，他们兴奋地议论着：盼了多少年的火车，今天满载着幸福来了。
