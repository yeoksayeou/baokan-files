    Spring Full in Barren Hills, New Scene in Old Revolutionary Base Areas
    Jiangxi's 50,000 Transferred Cadres Labor Diligently for a Year, Transforming the Mountainous Landscape

    (Reported by this newspaper) Over the past year, 50,000 transferred cadres in Jiangxi Province have diligently engaged in construction on over 170 mountain peaks, achieving remarkable results in the development of mountainous areas. They have reclaimed 250,000 mu of wasteland overgrown with weeds, afforested 700,000 mu of land, and established over 2,000 factories. Simultaneously, tens of thousands of transferred cadres have learned numerous production techniques through labor, transformed their thinking, and are striding towards the path of both redness and expertise.

    Sixty percent of Jiangxi Province is mountainous, with a significant portion being old revolutionary base areas. These areas are rich in resources but severely lack labor. Last year, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to transfer 50,000 cadres to mountainous areas with the dual purpose of training cadres and developing the mountains, thus accelerating the construction of old revolutionary base areas.

    After arriving in the mountains last winter, the 50,000 transferred cadres in Jiangxi have, through a year of labor, initially transformed the landscape of the mountain areas. Last year, there were only barren hills and thickets, with some areas having no signs of human habitation for miles. This year, everything is vibrant and the landscape has been completely renewed. What was once wasteland covered with thorns and weeds now grows various crops, some of which have already yielded their first harvests. The once bare mountains are now planted with pine, fir, and various fruit trees. The mountains and plains are dotted with pigs, cattle, and sheep raised by the cadres. In addition, all the mountain peaks have been equipped with telephones, many places have built roads, and hydroelectric or thermal power stations have been established, with electric lights beginning to illuminate the mountain areas. On Mount Jinggang, which stands at an altitude of over 1,400 meters, when the cadres first arrived, the uneven wilderness was covered with cogon grass taller than a person, and thick layers of snow had accumulated in the grass. More than 700 transferred cadres reclaimed 600 mu of wasteland here and planted crops, harvesting rice, sweet potatoes, corn, vegetables, and potatoes. Rows of clean, white-tiled houses have been built on Mount Jinggang, including a post and telecommunications office, a supply and marketing cooperative, a bank branch, and a Communist Labor University with over a thousand students. Trucks transporting supplies travel constantly on the newly built roads. At night, electric lights illuminate the hills. This revolutionary birthplace with great historical significance has become a new mountain city. Zhanggong Mountain, known for its tea production, previously suffered from a lack of manpower, leaving the tea trees unmanaged across the mountains and fields. After more than 800 cadres arrived, they immediately carried out careful cultivation of the tea plantations and reclaimed more than 800 mu of tea plantations that had been abandoned since the Soviet era. This year, the tea harvest was unprecedentedly abundant, with 40,000 jin harvested. The Wuyi Mountains used to have many barren hills and ridges. After the cadres arrived, they set the task of "each person planting a thousand trees and reclaiming five mu of wasteland." As a result, they completed the task a month ahead of schedule, reclaiming more than 2,000 mu of wasteland and afforesting more than 3,000 mu, realizing the goal of "turning barren mountains into forests."

    In the high mountains and steep ridges where the sound of machinery had never been heard, transferred cadres have established various factories this year. The cadres on Damao Mountain put forward the slogan of "turning grass into treasure, turning the useless into the useful," setting off a great upsurge in industrial development using wild plants. Currently, Damao Mountain has established 62 factories covering 16 industrial projects, including brewing, oil pressing, papermaking, rubber baking, and iron smelting, all of which have been put into production.

    The great achievements of the transferred cadres in developing the mountainous areas were achieved after overcoming numerous difficulties. When cadres on Mount Jinggang were reclaiming wasteland, they had no tools for cutting grass, so they pulled it by hand, leaving bloody cuts on their palms, but no one wanted to rest. After pulling the cogon grass, they dug through the snow to reclaim the wasteland, which was frozen as hard as stone. They proudly said, "Our hands have caught up with the sickle, and ten fingers have outperformed the iron hoe." Within three months, they had reclaimed more than 600 mu of wasteland.

    The cadres' construction of the mountainous areas has brought great encouragement to the people in these areas. Those who were previously unwilling to stay in the mountains now express their determination to work together with the cadres to build new mountainous areas. Recently, the cadres on various mountain peaks and the members of local agricultural cooperatives have jointly established people's communes. (Attached pictures)

### 荒山春意满  老区景象新  江西五万下放干部刻苦劳动一年山区面貌改观

    荒山春意满  老区景象新
    江西五万下放干部刻苦劳动一年山区面貌改观
    本报讯  江西省五万下放干部在一百七十多个山头上刻苦建设一年，取得了建设山区的巨大成绩。他们在长满杂草的荒山上开垦出了二十五万亩荒地，植树造林七十万亩，兴办了二千多个工厂。同时，数万下放干部在劳动中学会了许多生产技术，改造了自己的思想，阔步走向红与专的大道。
    江西省有60％的面积是山区，其中大部分是老革命根据地；这里资源丰富，却严重缺乏劳动力。中共江西省委于去年决定把五万干部下放到山区的目的，一是锻炼干部，一是开发山区，加速老革命根据地的建设。
    江西五万下放干部在去年严冬季节上山后，经过一年劳动，已初步改变了山头面貌。去年这里只有荒山和树丛，有的地区横直十余里看不到人烟；今年，这里到处生气蓬勃，面貌焕然一新。过去长满荆棘杂草的荒地上，现在长着各种各样的庄稼，有的已获得了第一次丰收；过去光秃秃的荒山上，现在栽有松、杉和各种果树；漫山遍野是干部们饲养的猪、牛和羊群。此外，所有山头都架起了电话，许多地方修通了公路，建起了水力或火力发电站，电灯开始照亮了山间。在海拔一千四百多公尺高的井冈山上，干部上山时，高低不平的荒山上长着比人高的芭茅草，草里积了厚厚的雪层。七百多名下放干部就在这里开垦出了六百亩荒地，并种上了农作物，收获了水稻、红薯、玉米、蔬菜和马铃薯。井冈山上修起了一排排洁白的瓦房，有邮电所、供销社、银行营业所和一个拥有上千名学生的共产主义劳动大学。运输物资的汽车在新修的公路上来往不断。夜间，电灯照亮了山岗。这个富有伟大历史意义的革命发源地已变成一座新兴的山城。以产茶叶著称的障公山，过去因为劳力少，满山遍野的茶树没有人管理。八百多名干部到这里后，立即对茶山进行了细致的培育，把苏区时代荒芜下来的八百多亩茶山进行了垦复。今年茶叶获得了空前大丰收，采摘了四万斤。武夷山过去有许多荒山秃岭。干部上山后，就提出了“每人植树千棵，开荒五亩”的任务；结果提前一月完成了任务，开荒二千多亩，植树造林三千多亩，实现了“秃山皆林”。
    从古来没有听到过机器响声的高山峻岭上，下放干部今年在这里办起了各种各样的工厂。大茅山上的干部提出：“把草变成宝、变无用为有用”的口号，掀起了一个利用野生植物的大办工业的热潮。现在大茅山上兴办的工业有酿酒、榨油、造纸、烤胶、炼铁等十六个项目、六十二个工厂，并已全部投入了生产。
    下放干部建设山区的巨大成绩，是在克服重重困围之后取得的。井冈山上的干部在开垦荒地时，割草没有工具，他们便用手拔，手掌上划破了一道道的血口，谁也不愿意休息；拔了茅草便刨开积雪，开垦冻结得像石块一样的荒地。他们自豪地说：“双手赶上了镰刀，十个指头比赢了铁锄。”三个月内便开垦了六百多亩荒地。
    干部建设山区，给山区人民带来了极大的鼓舞。过去不安心在山区的人们，现在表示坚决与干部一起共同建设新山区。最近，各个山头上的干部和当地农业社社员一起建成了人民公社。（附图片）
