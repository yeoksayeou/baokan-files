    "Omnipotent" Material
    Plastic is a general term for high-molecular organic compounds, characterized by its ease of processing and molding, and its plasticity.

    The production of plastics has opened up an extremely wide range of material sources for mankind. It can be applied to various industrial sectors. In the transportation industry, automobiles and vehicle steering wheels, as well as train and ship bulkheads and floors made of plastic, are not only lightweight and durable but also non-flammable. In the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, plastics can be used as insulation materials for generators, motors, transformer equipment, cables, etc. In the telecommunications industry, telephones, radio transceivers, and televisions all rely on plastics. In the metallurgical industry, castings made with plastic molds are much better than those cast with sandboxes, and the mechanical processing procedure can be greatly reduced. Using plastic as rolling mill bearings not only saves non-ferrous metals but also helps to reduce the bearing temperature due to its wear resistance and corrosion resistance. In the textile industry, almost 80%-90% of metal parts can be replaced with plastic parts. These parts do not produce the noise of metal parts when operating, and can be called silent machinery. In the medical industry, and even in the world's newest technologies such as the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, the manufacturing of long-range missiles and artificial satellites, plastic is also an indispensable material. In addition to the above uses, plastics can also be made into various colorful clothes, bags, shoes, and many beautiful daily necessities to beautify our lives.

    “万能”的材料
    塑料是高分子有机化合物的通称，它具有易于加工成型和可塑性的特点。
    塑料的生产，给人类开辟了极广泛的物质来源。它可以应用到各种工业部门。在交通运输工业中，用塑料做成的汽车、车辆驾驶盘以及火车、轮船的隔板和地板，不但轻巧、耐用，还不会着火。在电机制造工业中，塑料可作发电机、电动机、变压设备、电缆等的绝缘材料。在电讯工业中，不论是电话机、无线电收发报机或电视机都离不开塑料。在冶金工业中，用塑料做的铸模，浇出的铸件比用砂箱浇出的铸件好得多，还可以大大减少机械加工程序。用塑料做成轧钢机轴承，不但节省有色金属，由于它具有耐磨、抗蚀的性能，便于降低轴承的温度。在纺织工业中，几乎有80％—90％的金属机件可以用塑料代替，这种机件在开动时没有金属机件的吵杂声，可称为无声机械。在医药工业中，以至世界上最新的科学技术如原子能的和平利用，远程导弹和人造卫星的制造，塑料也是不可缺少的材料。除上述用途外，塑料还可以制成各色各样的内外衣、皮包、皮鞋及许多美丽的日用品，来美化我们的生活。
