Both Self-Sufficiency and Commodity Production Go Hand in Hand
    Gansu Communes Integrate Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fishery for Mutual Promotion

    (Our dispatch) Gansu's people's communes are actively implementing the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production. They are adopting specialized organizational forms that combine year-round management with short-term intensive campaigns, and are developing sideline production and diversified operations comprehensively, based on local conditions.

    Gansu has a vast territory and abundant resources. People's communes ensure the development of commodity production through organization. Year-round management of farm production and seasonal team production organically combine the industrial and agricultural production of people's communes with forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, sericulture, and medicinal herb production, promoting mutual development.

    With the rapid development of people's communes throughout the province, specialized organizations with year-round operations are also flourishing like bamboo shoots after rain. The Zhangye Special District has established more than 400 commune-run forest farms to develop the desert. More than 60,000 commune-run livestock farms have been built throughout the province. The eastern mountainous area is becoming a new sericulture breeding base, with more than 60% of the teams in Tianshui Special District having specialized sericulture organizations. Fishery has also begun operations in many places, with Tianshui City alone utilizing reservoirs and ponds to establish 330 fish farms. Recently, the province has also reorganized the sideline production teams that the masses have traditionally been engaged in, and is launching large-scale campaigns towards the high mountains, forests, and beaches. The counties in the Hexi Corridor have adopted the method of specialized corps operations, mining more than 60,000 tons of gypsum and lead-zinc ore and firing more than 70 million bricks and tiles in just over a month. The collection of wild industrial raw materials has also greatly exceeded previous years.

    This year, in developing sideline production and diversified operations, the province has displayed the superiority of the people's communes and their "large" and "public" nature. Not only has it unfolded with unprecedented momentum and opened up some new business avenues, but it has also shown many new features that differ from the past. First, it has strengthened leadership, made overall arrangements, and actively implemented the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture and to self-sufficient production and commodity production. People's communes in various places have drawn tens of thousands of laborers and rationally established specialized organizations for year-round management and short-term intensive campaigns. Under the leadership of secretaries or directors specifically responsible for this task, they are vigorously engaged in diversified operations. This has not only expanded commodity production, met the needs of national industry and foreign trade, and accumulated funds for expanded reproduction, but also gradually resolved the wage issues of commune members and the self-sufficient materials they need. The sideline income of the people's communes in Jinta County exceeds 10 million yuan. After paying wages for three months to all commune members, there is still a surplus of more than 7 million yuan that can be used to expand production. Second, it is developing sideline production and diversified operations comprehensively, based on local conditions. These specialized organizations are based on local natural conditions, with one or several types of operations as the main focus, while simultaneously implementing diversified operations. For example, forest farms mainly focus on greening the desert, but also collect industrial fiber raw materials, wild oilseeds, medicinal herbs, and substitute foods. Livestock farms mainly focus on breeding livestock, but also raise small livestock, poultry, and engage in breeding services. This allows diversified operations to develop in a planned manner. The Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture has newly established 4,000 commune-run livestock farms, and the number of live pigs has jumped from 10,000 last year to nearly 100,000, while sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and bees have also increased by one to three times compared to last year. Third, it is promoting division of labor and specialization, implementing the responsibility system, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing region, so as to better leverage the professional and technical expertise of the masses, cultivate "all-rounders" in a step-by-step manner, and put diversified operations on the track of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Fourth, the people's communes, which are moving towards industrialization, have more power to develop diversified processing industries, implementing local sourcing of materials and local processing. The province has built as many as 1,000 larger comprehensive factories for utilizing forest resources and processing forestry and special products. The Kongtong People's Commune in Pingliang operates as many as sixteen types of processing industries, including flax, brewing, mountain goods, and rayon.

    The expansion of commodity production in people's communes in various places has promoted the active trade and exchange between communes and the state, and between communes and communes. Therefore, this year, many of the province's procurement projects for local products, special products, and agricultural and livestock sideline products have been overfulfilled. (Zhai Qiyin)

    自给生产和商品生产并举
    甘肃各公社农林牧副渔结成整体相互促进
    本报讯  甘肃各地人民公社积极贯彻自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，采用常年经营与短期突击相结合的专业组织形式，因地制宜地全面发展副业生产和多种经营。
    甘肃幅员辽阔，资源丰富。人民公社从组织上保证了商品性生产的发展，常年经营的建场生产，按季节经营的建队生产，把人民公社的工农业生产和林、牧、副、渔、蚕桑、药材等生产组成了一个有机结合的整体，相互促进，共同发展。
    随着全省人民公社的大发展，常年经营的专业组织也像雨后春笋似的繁荣起来。张掖专区为开发沙漠，建立社办林场四百多个；全省共建成社办牧场六万多个；东部山区正在建成一个新的蚕桑养殖地，天水专区有60％以上的社队设有蚕桑专业组织；渔业也在许多地方开始经营，仅天水市利用水库、池塘办起的鱼场就有三百三十处。最近，全省又重新整顿了群众历来就有经营习惯的副业生产专业队伍，向高山、森林、沙滩大规模进军。河西走廊各县采取专业兵团作战的方法，在短短的一个多月内，便开采石膏、铅锌矿石六万多吨，烧制砖瓦七千多万块，野生工业原料的采集量，也大大超过往年。
    今年全省在开展副业生产和多种经营方面，由于发挥了人民公社和“大”“公”的优越性，不但以从未有过的声势摆开，开辟一些新的经营门路，而且在许多方面显示出与过去不同的许多新特征。首先是加强领导，统筹安排，积极贯彻工农业并举、自给性生产与商品性生产并举的方针，各地人民公社已抽出几十万个劳动力，合理建成常年经营和短期突击的专业组织，在专门负责这项任务的书记或社长的领导下，大搞多种经营，这样既扩大了商品性生产，满足国家工业和对外贸易的需要，积累了扩大再生产的资金，并使社员的工资问题及其所需要的自给性物资也逐步得到解决。金塔县各人民公社副业收入一千余万元，除足够全体社员发放三个月的工资外，还剩余七百多万元可以用于扩大生产。其次是因地制宜，全面发展副业生产和多种经营，这些专业组织，都是根据当地的自然条件，以一种或数种经营为主，同时实行多种经营，如林场除以绿化沙漠为主，又采集工业纤维原料，野生油籽，药材和代食品；牧场以繁殖种畜为主，又饲养小家畜，家禽，并经营配种业务等，使多种经营得到有计划的发展，临夏回族自治州新建社办牧场四千个，生猪即从去年的一万头跃增到近十万头，羊鸡鸭兔蜂也比去年增加一倍至三倍。第三，分工分业，推行责任制，包产量，包质量，包地区，更好地发挥群众的专业技术特长，有步骤地培养“多面手”，把多种经营纳入多快省的轨道。第四，正在迈向工业化的人民公社，具有更多的力量发展多种经营的加工业，实行就地取材，就地加工，全省兴建的较大的综合利用森林资源的林、副特产品加工厂即达千座；平凉崆峒人民公社经营的亚麻、酿酒、山货、人造棉等加工业有十六种之多。
    各地人民公社商品性生产的扩大，促进了公社和国家、公社和公社之间贸易、交换的活跃。因此，今年全省地方产品、特产品和农畜副产品的采购项目，很多都已超额完成。    （翟其寅）
