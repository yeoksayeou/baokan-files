    "Three-Level" Management, "Five-Household" Operation
    This newspaper reports: Under the principle of collective management as the mainstay, the Maqiu People's Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has adopted a method of "three-level" (commune, brigade, team) management and "five-household" (commune, brigade, team, canteen, members) operation, which has greatly developed sideline production. In the past two months alone, it has supplied more than 10 million jin of non-staple food to cities and industrial and mining areas.
    The Maqiu People's Commune is located on the shores of Poyang Lake, rich in resources, and has favorable conditions for developing sideline production. The commune's Party committee proposed that sideline production must also involve a large-scale mass movement, using "walking on two legs," that is, combining collective management and individual management by commune members. Under the principle of collective management as the mainstay, the "three-level" management and "five-household" operation method was adopted to develop sideline production, resulting in a leap forward in sideline production. Currently, the entire commune raises more than 50,000 hogs, more than 210,000 poultry, and has planted more than 5,000 mu of vegetables. Compared with the previous period, these quantities have increased five to ten times. In addition, there are 500 boats fishing outside and more than 80 people hunting geese outside. Other sideline occupations, such as digging lotus roots, processing non-staple foods, and transportation, are also doing well. Now, the commune's sideline products not only fully meet market needs and support cities and industrial and mining areas, but also ensure the self-sufficiency of commune members in non-staple foods and improve their lives. The entire commune's monthly income from sideline production reaches more than 110,000 yuan. (Li Jiuzhe, Liu Guanghui, Mei Guobao) (Attached photo)

    “三级”管理“五家”经营
    本报讯  江西南昌县麻丘人民公社在以集体经营为主的原则下，采用“三级”（社、大队、小队）管理，“五家”（社、大队、小队、食堂、社员）经营的办法，大大地发展了副业生产。近两个月仅供应城市和工矿区的副食品就有一千多万斤。
    麻丘人民公社地处鄱阳湖滨，物产丰富，有着发展副业生产的有利条件。公社党委提出搞副业生产也必须大搞群众运动，用“两条腿走路”，即集体经营和社员个人经营相结合，在以集体经营为主的原则下，采用“三级”管理、“五家”经营的办法发展副业，使副业生产得到了飞跃的发展。现在，全社饲养有五万多头毛猪，二十一万多只家禽，种了五千多亩蔬菜，这些与前一时期比较，数量都增加了五倍到十倍。此外，还有五百只船在外捕鱼，八十多人在外打雁。其他如挖藕、副食品加工、运输等各项副业也都搞得不错。现在这个公社的副业产品，不仅充分供应了市场需要，支援了城市和工矿区，同时又保证了社员副食品的自给，改善了生活。全社每月副业生产的收入达十一万多元。（李久泽、刘光辉、梅国宝）（附图片）
