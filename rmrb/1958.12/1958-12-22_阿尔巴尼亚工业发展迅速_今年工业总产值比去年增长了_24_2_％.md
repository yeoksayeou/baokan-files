Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 17th: According to newspaper reports, Albania's gross industrial output in 1958 increased by 24.2% compared to 1957. Workers increased production for the country by products valued at more than 2.6 billion leks (Albanian currency).

	During this year, the production of major industrial sectors exceeded that of 1957 in both quantity and quality. For example, copper ore increased by 37%, the machinery manufacturing industry grew by 33%, the construction industry increased by 29%, and the petroleum industry increased by 11%. Due to better organization of labor and expanded mechanical operations, employees nationwide reduced costs by more than 100 million leks compared to the original plan.

	This year, many new industrial and mining enterprises were completed and put into production, including the Marx Hydropower Station with an annual output of 120 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, iron-nickel mines, the Tirana Glass Factory, and the Porcelain Factory. At the same time, many industrial and mining enterprises, such as chrome mines, copper mines, the Vlorë and Shkodër cement plants, and the Hoxha Iron Factory, completed their annual production plans half a month or a month ahead of schedule. The construction sector's achievements were particularly outstanding. When the slogan of "faster, better, and more economical" was put forward this year, although the task increased by 23% compared to last year, construction workers also overfulfilled their tasks.

	Albanian Minister of Industry and Mining, Charcani, said: "In 1959, the industrial and mining industry will continue to develop. The production of the mining industry will increase by 17% compared to 1958, of which copper ore will increase by 39%, electricity will increase by 19%, machinery will increase by 29%, chrome ore will increase by 24%, and the food industry will increase by 20%."

    今年有不少新的工矿企业建成并投入生产，其中包括年产一亿二千万度电力的马克思水电站、铁镍矿、地拉那玻璃厂和瓷器厂等。同时，有不少的工矿企业，像铬矿、铜矿、发罗那和斯库台的两个大水泥厂和以霍查命名的铁工厂提前半个月或一个月完成了全年的生产计划。建筑部门的成绩尤其突出。当今年提出了快、好、省的口号后，虽然任务比去年增加了23％，但是建筑工人也超额完成了任务。
    阿尔巴尼亚工矿部部长查尔查尼说：“1959年将要继续发展工矿业。采矿工业的生产将比1958年增加17％，其中铜矿将增加39％，电力将增加19％，机械增加29％，铬矿增加24％，食品工业增加20％。
