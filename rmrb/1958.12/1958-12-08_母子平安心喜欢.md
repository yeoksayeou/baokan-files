    Mother and Child Safe and Sound, Heartily Happy
    By Zhou Junqun, Health Worker at Datang Health Clinic, Yongning County, Guangxi
    I am an ordinary Zhuang nationality village girl. My mother died fourteen years ago due to difficult childbirth, and this event often moves me deeply. After graduating from senior primary school, I resolved to become a new-style rural midwife. Coincidentally, the county wanted to train a group of midwives, selecting two from each township. I was the first to run to the township to sign up, but the township cadre said, "After you go to study and come back, someone must be willing to call you to deliver babies. You are still an unmarried girl who hasn't given birth, who would call you to deliver babies?" He didn't agree to me going to study. There was no way, I thought, "I still have some education, so I'll study at home." So, I bought two midwifery manuals and always took one or two hours to study them every day after work in the fields at noon or before going to bed at night. In this way, I understood some basic midwifery knowledge, but I didn't have any midwifery equipment or practical experience, so I didn't dare to boldly help people deliver babies. It wasn't until winter when the county maternal and child health center officially opened a health training class that I applied and was admitted. I excitedly ran home to tell my father, but unexpectedly my father said, "Doing this kind of work is base and unpromising. Good people don't do this kind of thing, and those who do this kind of thing are not good people." He even hid my luggage and wouldn't let me go. What to do? I said to him painfully, "Didn't my mother die from difficult childbirth? In the old society, I don't know how many working people died of illness and starvation without anyone caring. Now the Communist Party is leading us to turn ourselves around, the government cares about us, and training health workers is also for the health of the children and grandchildren of the peasants. What's so base about it?" After saying this for a long time, I finally got through to my father's thinking.
    After studying for three months, I graduated, and the organization assigned me to do maternal and child health work in Datang District, Yongning County. This is a mountainous area, with a total area of 180 li in length and breadth. There were only five midwives in the entire district, and the foundation of maternal and child health work was relatively poor. When I first arrived, some people called me "old midwife" and were unwilling to approach me. Once, I had just returned from delivering a baby and, after washing my hands, went to the cafeteria to eat. When I picked up a wooden ladle to wash my bowl with water, some people refused to use the ladle again, saying that the "old midwife's hands were dirty." At that time, I was very sad and couldn't understand why doing this kind of work would be looked down upon. However, I thought that the Party and Youth League organizations often taught us that as long as it is something beneficial to the Party and the people, we should resolutely do it, and I became determined to be a midwife for the rest of my life.
    Once, in Da'an Township, a woman had a miscarriage with heavy bleeding and was in life-threatening condition, requiring immediate emergency treatment. At that time, the doctor in the clinic was not at home, and I had just returned from the countryside, it was already after 7:00 PM. I hurriedly put down the bowl of rice I had just picked up, and walked with my medicine kit on my back. I ran fifty more li of mountain roads in one breath to the home of the pregnant woman and saved the woman who was already unconscious.
    Another time, in Nagan Village, Nanzhou Township, a first-time mother named Li had a difficult childbirth with excessive bleeding, and she had fainted several times. Her life was in great danger, and her family asked the health clinic for emergency treatment. That night, it was raining heavily and pitch black. I had just participated in the rural campaign to eliminate the four pests and immediately went to see the patient. I carried my medicine bag, braved the gale and rainstorm, and walked fifty more li of rugged mountain roads. It was dark, the road was slippery, the wind and rain were heavy, and the trees and grass rustled as if something was following behind me. My heart pounded, but I thought about ensuring the safety of the mother and child, so I braced myself, took big steps, and desperately hurried on my way. When I arrived at the pregnant woman's house, it was already one o'clock in the morning. After emergency treatment, the pregnant woman woke up, and safely gave birth to her first child in the second half of the night. The old woman in her sixties held my hand tightly and said, "It's all thanks to the Communist Party, all thanks to the comrade who saved two people in my family. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can there be such good cadres. If it were in the Kuomintang era, if we Zhuang women were sick or in pain, who would pity us? Not to mention at night, even if you hired a sedan chair to ask them to come during the day, they wouldn't come. The Communist Party truly cares about our minority nationalities!"
    In the past two years, I have rescued more than a dozen women with difficult childbirth and more than a hundred children. From then on, no one looked down on midwives anymore, and they became particularly respectful and affectionate towards us.

    母子平安心喜欢
    广西邕宁县大塘卫生所保健员  周俊群
    我是一个普通的僮族农村姑娘。我母亲在十四年前因为生小孩难产而死去，这件事经常激动着我。我在高小毕业后，就立志要当个农村的新式接生员。恰巧，县里要训练一批接生员，每乡选派两人。我第一个跑到乡里去报名，但乡干部却说：“去学习回来，一定要有人肯叫去接生才行，你自己还是个没结婚、没生过小孩的姑娘仔，谁会叫你去接生呢？”不同意我去学。没办法，我想：“我还有点文化，就自己在家里学吧。”于是，我买了两本接生员手册，每天中午从地里收工回来或晚上睡觉之前总抽出一、两个钟头来学。这样，我懂得了一些接生常识，但是没有接生用具，也没有实习过，所以还不敢大胆帮人接生。直到冬天，县妇幼保健所正式开办保健训练班，我去投考，录取了。我兴冲冲地跑回家说给父亲听，不料父亲说：“干这行下贱，没出息，好人不干这种事，干这种事的都不是好人。”还把我的行李藏了起来，不给我走。怎样办呢？我沉痛地对他说：“母亲不就是难产死的吗？旧社会不知有多少劳动人民病死、饿死也没人管，现在共产党领导我们翻了身，政府关心我们，训练保健员也是为了农民子孙身体健康，有什么下贱呢？”说了半天，才把父亲的思想打通。
    学习三个月就毕业了，组织上分配我到邕宁县大塘区搞妇幼卫生工作。这是个山区，全区纵横一百八十里，共只有五个接生员，妇幼卫生工作基础较差。我刚到时，有些人叫我“接生婆”，不肯接近我。有一次我刚接生回来，洗过手后到食堂去吃饭，拿起一只木瓢要水洗碗，有些人见了就不肯再用这个木瓢了，说是“接生婆手脏”。当时我很难过，想不通为什么做这种工作会叫人看不起。但是，我想到党团组织经常教导我们，只要对党对人民有利的事，就应该坚决去干，便又坚强起来了，决心干一辈子接生员。
    有一次，大安乡有个妇女小产大流血，有生命危险，需要马上急救。当时所内医生不在家，我刚下乡回来，已是下午七点多钟。我急忙把刚端起来的饭碗放下，背起药箱就走。一口气跑了五十多里山路，赶到产妇家里挽救了这个已经不省人事的妇女。
    又一次，南州乡那甘村有个姓李的初产妇难产，流血过多，几次昏迷过去，生命非常危险，家里人要求卫生所急救。当晚正下大雨，一片漆黑，我刚参加农村除四害回来，便立即出诊。我背着药包，冒着狂风暴雨，走了五十多里崎岖不平的山路，天又黑，路又滑，风雨又大，树林丛草沙沙的响，好像有什么在后面跟着跑一样，我的心嘣嘣的跳，但我想起了要使母子生命安全，便硬着头皮、迈开大步，拼命的赶路，赶到产妇家已是深夜一点钟了。经过急救，产妇苏醒了过来，下半夜便安全地生下了第一个孩子。六十多岁的老婆婆紧紧地握着我的手说：“全靠共产党，全靠同志救活我家两个人，只有共产党、毛主席教导下才有这样好的干部，若是国民党时代，我们僮族妇女有病有痛，有谁来可怜？莫讲是黑夜，就是白天用轿子请也不来，共产党真正关心我们少数民族啊！”
    两年多来，我就这样急救了十多个难产妇和一百多个小孩。从此不但再没有人看不起接生员，而且对我们分外尊重和亲热了。
