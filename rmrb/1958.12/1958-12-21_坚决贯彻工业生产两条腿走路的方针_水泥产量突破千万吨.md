    Resolutely Implement the Policy of "Walking on Two Legs" in Industrial Production
    Cement Production Exceeds 10 Million Tons

    (Our Dispatch) China has achieved a double harvest in the production of both conventional and indigenous cement. To date, the total national production of conventional and indigenous cement has surpassed the 10 million ton mark, an increase of more than 50% compared to the total cement production of last year, strongly supporting urban and rural production and construction.

    The rapid development of the cement industry is the result of implementing the policy of "walking on two legs" in industrial production and launching a vigorous mass movement. This year, the employees of existing cement plants that use modern methods of production launched a vigorous technical revolution, universally promoting the production experience of "three bigs and one fast" (big wind, big feed, big fire, and fast rotating kiln), which rapidly increased production. After the Mudanjiang Cement Plant implemented this production experience, the production of its Lepol kilns reached 46.48 tons of cement per hour, setting a national record for the highest output of similar kilns, exceeding the designed capacity by more than one time. Many cement plants have also adopted appropriate proportions of lime as a raw material, greatly increasing cement production. Cement plant employees have devised various methods to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials, power supply, and transportation bottlenecks caused by increased productivity. They established "satellite" factories such as indigenous kilns, indigenous steel plants, machinery plants, refractory material plants, and paper bag plants, producing their own cement raw materials such as lime and slag, and manufacturing their own equipment such as electric motors and ball mills, partially solving the urgent need for raw materials and electricity.

    This year, the mass movement of small indigenous cement plants has flourished across the country. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, more than 41,000 indigenous cement kilns have been put into production, producing more than 1 million tons of cement, solving part of the needs for farmland water conservancy and urban and rural construction projects in various regions. These small cement plants (kilns) are built using local materials, making do with whatever is available, or using waste materials. They do not require the preparation of large amounts of equipment and can be quickly built and put into production. Yunnan Province used this indigenous method to produce more than 70,000 tons of cement, ensuring the construction needs of 360 medium and small reservoirs. Small cement plants (kilns) are currently undergoing extensive technical and equipment upgrades, gradually forming small cement production enterprises on the existing basis. Many regional small cement plants have gradually added various indigenous machines or a combination of indigenous and modern mechanical equipment to replace manual processes such as crushing, pelletizing, mixing, and sieving, significantly increasing production. Many small cement plants have fully mastered the four key production technologies of proportioning, mixing, firing, and crushing, and the production of high-grade cement has been continuously increasing. At present, the national production of high-grade cement produced by indigenous methods has reached 200,000 to 300,000 tons, with quality comparable to "modern" cement.

### 坚决贯彻工业生产两条腿走路的方针  水泥产量突破千万吨

    坚决贯彻工业生产两条腿走路的方针
    水泥产量突破千万吨
    本报讯  我国洋土水泥生产获得双丰收。到目前为止，全国洋土水泥总产量已迈过一千万吨大关，比去年全年的水泥产量增长了50％以上，有力的支援了城乡生产建设。
    水泥工业生产的飞跃发展，是贯彻工业生产两条腿走路的方针和大搞群众运动的结果。今年，原有的用现代方法生产的水泥厂的职工大闹技术革命，普遍推行了大风、大料、大火和快速转窑的“三大一快”生产经验，使产量迅速提高。牡丹江水泥厂推行了这项生产经验以后，使立波尔窑的产量达到每小时产水泥四十六点四八吨，创同类窑产量的全国最高纪录，超过设计能力一倍以上。许多水泥厂还采用了适当比例的石灰配料方法，使水泥产量大大提高。水泥厂的职工们想出各种办法克服由于生产力提高所带来的原材料、电力供应不足和运输紧张的困难，他们兴办了土窑、土钢铁厂、机械厂、耐火材料厂、纸袋厂等“卫星”工厂，自己生产石灰、炉渣等水泥原料，自己制造电动机、球磨机等设备，部分解决了对原材料、电力的紧急需要。
    今年，土法生产水泥的小土群运动已在全国各地开花结果。据十三个省、市、自治区不完全的统计，投入生产的土水泥窑有四万一千多个，生产水泥一百多万吨，解决了各地兴修农田水利和城乡建设工程的部分需要。这些小水泥厂（窑）都是就地取材、因陋就简或利用废料建起来的，不需要筹办大量的设备，很快就能建成投入生产。云南省采用这种土法生产水泥七万多吨，保证了三百六十个中、小型水库建设的需要。小水泥厂（窑）目前正在广泛进行技术、设备改造，在现有基础上逐步形成小型水泥生产企业。许多地区小水泥厂已逐步添制各种土机器或土洋结合的机械设备，代替人力粉碎、搓球、搅拌、筛粉等工序，使产量显著提高。不少小水泥厂已完全掌握了配、拌、烧、碎四个生产技术关键，高标号水泥产量已不断增加。目前，全国土法生产的高标号水泥已达二、三十万吨，质量和“洋”水泥一样。
