Xinhua News Agency, December 25th. The Communist Party of the Netherlands is scheduled to hold its 19th National Congress from December 26th to 29th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has sent a telegram of congratulations, the full text of which is as follows:

To the Comrades of the Entire Delegate Body of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, forwarded to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, extends the warmest fraternal congratulations to your party's congress and, through the congress, expresses sincere respect to all Dutch Communists and the Dutch people.

For nearly forty years, the Communist Party of the Netherlands has made significant contributions in the struggle to safeguard the vital interests of the Dutch working class and working people, and to strive for democracy and social progress in the Netherlands. During the war years, the Communist Party of the Netherlands was a strong leading force in upholding the anti-Hitler struggle. In the post-war years, the Communist Party of the Netherlands united the domestic democratic and progressive forces and carried out an unswerving struggle to safeguard the national independence of the Netherlands and oppose the Dutch monopoly forces' colonialist policies.

In recent years, the Communist Party of the Netherlands has been closely united with the international communist movement headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and has launched a resolute and powerful counterattack against the attacks of imperialism and the sabotage of revisionist elements. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Grot, the Communist Party of the Netherlands has also carried out a struggle within its own ranks to safeguard the party's unity, purged the right-wing group headed by Looder, Brandtsen, and Wagenaar, and achieved a decisive victory in defending the party's Marxist-Leninist unity. The Communist Party of the Netherlands is worthy of being the advanced force of the Dutch proletariat and the most loyal defender of the interests of the Dutch working people and the Dutch nation.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always been concerned about and sympathetic to the struggle of your party and your people, and regard your achievements as our own. We would especially like to thank the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the Dutch people for their concern and support for our country's struggle to build socialism and liberate Taiwan.

We wish the Communist Party of the Netherlands new victories in strengthening the party's strength, expanding the unity of the working class and the unity of all democratic forces, and striving for democracy and social progress. We wish the Communist Party of the Netherlands even greater achievements in leading the Dutch people in safeguarding national independence, defending European security and world peace, developing friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries, and promoting Sino-Dutch relations.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    荷兰共产党召开第十九次代表大会
    中共中央电贺荷共中央
    新华社25日讯  荷兰共产党定于12月26日到29日召开第十九次代表大会。中国共产党中央委员会特地去电祝贺，贺电全文如下：荷兰共产党中央委员会转荷兰共产党第十九次代表大会全体代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和中国人民，向你们党的代表大会表示最热烈的兄弟的祝贺，并且通过大会向全体荷兰共产党员和荷兰人民表示诚挚的敬意。
    将近四十年来，荷兰共产党在维护荷兰工人阶级和劳动人民的切身利益、争取荷兰的民主和社会进步的斗争中已经作出了重大的贡献。在战争年代里，荷兰共产党是坚持反希特勒斗争的坚强的领导力量。在战后的年代里，荷兰共产党团结国内的民主进步力量，为维护荷兰的民族独立、反对荷兰垄断势力的殖民主义政策进行了坚持不渝的斗争。
    最近几年，荷兰共产党同以苏联共产党为首的国际共产主义队伍紧密地团结在一起，对于帝国主义的进攻和修正主义分子的破坏展开了坚决有力的还击。在以格鲁特同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，荷兰共产党还在自己的队伍里进行了维护党的团结的斗争，清除了露德尔、布兰德森和魏吉纳等为首的右派集团，取得了保卫党的马克思列宁主义的统一的决定性胜利。荷兰共产党不愧是荷兰无产阶级的先进队伍，荷兰劳动人民和荷兰民族利益的最忠实的捍卫者。
    中国共产党和中国人民一向关怀和同情你们的党和你们的人民的斗争，把你们的成就看成是我们的成就一样。我们要特别感谢荷兰共产党和荷兰人民对于我国建设社会主义和争取解放台湾的斗争所给予的关怀和支持。
    我们祝荷兰共产党在加强党的力量、扩大工人阶级的团结和一切民主力量的团结、争取民主和社会进步的斗争中获得新的胜利。祝荷兰共产党领导荷兰人民在维护民族独立、保卫欧洲安全和世界和平、发展各国人民之间的友好合作和促进中荷两国关系的努力中获得更大的成就。
                              中国共产党中央委员会
                                    1958年12月25日
