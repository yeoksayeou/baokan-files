Our revolutionary teacher Marx was also a poet.

Below are three lyrical poems he wrote in his youth.

From the first poem, it can be seen that from his youth, Marx looked down upon and hated the philistine behavior of those who were well-fed all day long and complacent. The second poem is dedicated to his beloved Jenny, and it is filled with his tender feelings and passionate love for Jenny. In the third poem, the poet not only believes in the power of human reason and emotion, but also in the power of human heroism and fearless ideals.

                                                                 ——Editor

                       A sleepy boor, fat,
  belly full, sitting in a soft armchair. Let the surrounding dark clouds linger, let the rumbling thunder roar—nothing in the world can make him panic or be embarrassed.
                  1837 Note: Boor is a German poet of the eighteenth century.

                       Two
  A thread invisibly and eternally connects us. A soul pursued by fate is also encouraged by you. The heat in my heart goes in vain to seek—your bright gaze, the radiance when you smile.
                  1836

                       Three
  If my whole soul sinks into the fire, I cannot live peacefully in a half-dreaming and half-awake state, nor can I live without battle and without storm. I want to explore art—the best gift of the Gods. The whole world is preparing to be enveloped by the power of reason and emotion. In order not to live meaninglessly in empty complacency—let us go together to the difficult and remote journey. We cannot spend this impoverished century under the shackles of shameful laziness. In courage, fearlessness, and longing, man is omnipotent and all-powerful.
                      1836

    马克思的三首诗
    我们的革命导师马克思，同时也是一位诗人。
    下面就是他在青年时代所写的三首抒情诗。
    从第一首中可以看出马克思从青年时代起就瞧不起和憎恨那种饱食终日、心安理得的市侩作风。第二首诗是献给他的爱人燕妮的，诗中渗透着他对燕妮的温柔感情和热情爱恋。第三首诗里，诗人不仅相信人的理智和情感的力量，而且也相信人的英勇无畏及理想憧憬的力量。
                                          ——编  者
                       一昏昏欲睡的伯尔格，体胖
  肚饱，坐在软绵绵的安乐椅上。让四周的乌云缭绕，让隆隆的雷声轰响，——在世界上没有什么能使得他惶惑窘怅。
                  1837年注：伯尔格是德国十八世纪
    的诗人。
                       二有一根线无形地久远联系着我俩。为命运所追逐的心灵，也为你所鼓励。我心中的热潮白白地去寻找——你明朗的目光，微笑时的光耀。
                  1836年
                       三如果我的整个心灵沉入火
  光中，我不能平静地半梦半醒的
  生活，没有战斗，没有暴风雨我也不能生活。我想探求艺术——上帝们最好的馈赠。整个世界正准备以理智和情感的力量笼罩。为了不致在空虚的苟且偷
  安中——生活得碌碌无为来吧，我们一起走向困难重重的遥远的途程。我们不能在可耻怠惰的羁
  绊下来度过这贫困的世纪。在勇敢无畏和渴望中人是全权的万能。
                      1836年
