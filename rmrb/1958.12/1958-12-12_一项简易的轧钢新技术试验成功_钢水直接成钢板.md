    A Simple New Steel Rolling Technology Experiment is Successful
    Molten Steel Directly Forms Steel Plate

    (Our Dispatch) Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, Beijing Institute of Chemical Machinery, and Jinxi Chemical Machinery Factory have recently successively experimented with the successful liquid casting and rolling of steel plate.

    The liquid casting and rolling of steel plate, co-operatively experimented on by the Beijing Institute of Chemical Machinery and Jinxi Chemical Machinery Factory, works as follows: the molten steel flows from a ladle into a trough-like channel, and then flows between two rotating rollers. In the blink of an eye, a red-hot steel strip emerges from the other side. In this way, molten steel is successfully transformed into steel plate. The rolled steel plate is a little over one millimeter thick, about three hundred millimeters wide, and three to four meters long. Some steel plates are as thick as three millimeters, with a tensile strength of 55 kilograms per square millimeter (rolled using an alloy steel), meeting the requirements of general steel plates.

    The liquid casting and rolling equipment has a simple structure, requires little power (the power used in the Jinxi Chemical Machinery Factory experiment was less than 1.5 horsepower), and has high production efficiency. If it is widely promoted throughout the country, it can solve the steel shortage problem to a certain extent.

    一项简易的轧钢新技术试验成功
    钢水直接成钢板
    本报讯  北京钢铁学院、东北工学院、北京化工机械研究所和锦西化工机械厂最近陆续试验液态铸轧钢板成功。
    北京化工机械研究所和锦西化工机械厂合作试验的液态铸轧钢板的情况是：把熔融的钢水从钢水包流到与簸箕相似的流子里，然后流到两个转动的滚子中间，转眼间，一条红色的钢带就从另一面吐了出来。钢水就这样成功地变成了钢板。轧成的钢板厚一毫米多，宽三百毫米左右，长三至四米。有的钢板厚达三毫米，抗张强度每平方毫米五十五公斤（是用一种合金钢轧制的），达到了一般钢板的要求。
    液态铸轧钢板的设备结构简单，所需动力小（锦西化工机械厂试验用的动力不到一点五马力），生产效率高。如果在全国普遍推广，可以在一定程度上解决钢材不足的问题。
