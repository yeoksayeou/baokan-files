The news: National postal and telecommunications workers, with the heroic action of "being good communication soldiers for the steel marshals," have basically built a postal and telecommunications network for national steel bases in a short period of time.

In the upsurge of the whole party and all the people engaging in the great steel-making movement, there is an urgent need for postal and telecommunications work to keep up closely. In order to ensure the steel marshals take command, postal and telecommunications workers across the country, regardless of difficulties in manpower, materials, equipment, and technology, confidently put forward the slogans: "Wherever the Party Committee Secretary goes, the telephone will be set up there," and "Wherever the steel army goes, postal and telecommunications will follow." They immediately launched an unprecedented mass movement for large-scale postal and telecommunications construction across the country. Many blast furnace clusters and mines can hold telephone conferences; the number of newspaper publications has doubled compared to 1957, basically guaranteeing the communication needs of the Party Committee in directing industrial and agricultural production and tens of millions of steel armies.

In the battle to ensure steel communications, postal and telecommunications departments in various regions further clarified that postal and telecommunications must serve the central task of the Party, and greatly improved their leadership style. Many Party branch secretaries and directors of postal and telecommunications bureaus personally took command and completed the communication tasks assigned by the Party at a revolutionary speed, together with their employees. For example, the Party branch secretary of the Baofeng County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Henan led employees to work hard for ten hours, completing the line erection tasks for all steel plants in the county, and realizing the network of steel base circuits. In early October, one million and two hundred thousand steel troops in Wanxian Special District, Sichuan, fought day and night. The secretaries of the District and County Party Committees went deep into the blast furnace clusters to direct the battle, and the postal and telecommunications departments immediately equipped them with mobile conference telephones and telephones. Many postal and telecommunications bureaus also sent special personnel carrying conference telephones to follow the Party Committee Secretaries, so that the secretaries and other leading cadres could hold telephone conferences at any time to check work and deploy tasks. In order to ensure smooth communication, many Party branch secretaries and directors of postal and telecommunications bureaus worked on-site, living in machine rooms, telegraph rooms, and telephone rooms, and strengthened the maintenance of machine and line equipment together with employees, improved communication collaboration, and improved operating techniques, thereby greatly improving equipment utilization. For example, the circuit utilization rate in Shandong Province increased from about 30% to about 50%. The effect of increasing circuit utilization in Sichuan Province was equivalent to adding 30% of the circuits.

In order to ensure steel communications, postal and telecommunications departments in various regions further clarified the idea that business must serve politics, and abolished many outdated rules and regulations. For example, according to the original regulations, users had to pay for labor and material costs before setting up a telephone, but this regulation was broken in steel communications. In terms of communication order, steel telephone calls were given priority across the country.

Through the battle to ensure steel communications, the mysterious view of postal and telecommunications technology was also broken, and the fallacy that "Chinese postal and telecommunications workers can only maintain communication equipment and cannot manufacture communication equipment" was thoroughly refuted. Employees who did not understand technology also engaged in creative inventions, and those who had not engaged in manufacturing also engaged in manufacturing on a large scale. Under the guidance of the idea of "self-reliance and not being a hand-stretcher," a large number of communication equipment was continuously produced. For example, postal and telecommunications enterprises in Jilin Province manufactured 140 single-channel carrier machines, which they had never manufactured before, within two months. Wang Fuying, a machine operator from the Changli County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Hebei Province, who had never seen a carrier machine, also made a carrier machine after 190 experiments. The steel construction site in Xinxiang Special District, Henan, needed to install 3,000 telephones in three days. Postal and telecommunications enterprises throughout the special district did not have these telephones, so they rushed to make them overnight and completed the task on schedule.

Postal and telecommunications bureaus in various regions also adjusted postal routes in a timely manner according to the needs of steel production, dispatched "military postal and telecommunications bureaus" and mobile service personnel, and delivered newspapers and magazines and mail to the steel army at the fastest speed. Generally, one shift was done every day, and some even delivered several shifts a day. Postal and telecommunications service personnel went deep into steel construction sites, canteens, and dormitories to "deliver letters and newspapers to the side of the blast furnace" to ensure the spiritual food of the steel army. Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces improved postal transportation tools or implemented day and night transportation methods to speed up the delivery of newspapers and magazines and mail, so that many counties and cities could see the provincial newspapers on the same day. When winter came, in order to keep the steel army warm, postal and telecommunications workers tried every means to deliver cotton clothes and packages to the steel front in a timely manner. For example, the Handan, Fengfeng Mining Area, Xingtai, and Shahe postal and telecommunications bureaus in Hebei Province led their employees to use pushcarts and bicycles to deliver more than 2,000 parcels to the front of the blast furnace. Their slogan was: "Deliver as soon as they arrive, never backlog," and the steel soldiers called them: "Sending charcoal in the snow and warmth in the cold."

At present, the postal and telecommunications network of the steel base is only basically formed and cannot fully meet the needs of steel production. At the same time, in the previous period, due to the many and rapid demands of steel production on postal and telecommunications, the postal and telecommunications departments had limited strength, so more temporary measures were taken in communication construction and the communication quality was not high. In order to adapt to the new situation of steel baseization and production factoryization, postal and telecommunications departments in various regions are actively carrying out postal and telecommunications construction while vigorously improving the communication network and increasing the number of fixed service bureaus, so that postal and telecommunications can better adapt to the needs of steel production and serve the constantly leaping industrial and agricultural production. "I'm here too!"

### 话机随着书记走  邮电跟着钢帅行

    话机随着书记走  邮电跟着钢帅行
    本报讯  全国邮电职工以“当好钢铁元帅通信兵”的豪迈行动，在短时间内，基本上建成了全国钢铁基地的邮电通信网。
    在全党全民大搞钢铁运动高潮中，迫切要求邮电通信工作紧紧跟上去。为保证钢帅升帐，全国邮电职工不顾人力、材料设备和技术等方面的困难，信心百倍地提出：“党委书记走到哪里，电话就架到哪里”、“钢铁大军到哪里，邮电就跟到哪里”的口号，立即在全国范围内掀起了一个史无前例的大搞邮电建设的群众运动。许多高炉群和矿山都能开电话会议；报纸发行数比1957年增加了一倍，基本上保证了党委指挥工农业生产和几千万钢铁大军的通信需要。
    在保证钢铁通信的战斗中，各地邮电部门更明确了邮电通信必须为党的中心任务服务，大大地改进了领导作风。很多邮电局的党支部书记和局长都亲自挂帅，和职工一起以革命的速度完成了党交给的通信任务。如河南宝丰县邮电局党支部书记带领职工苦战十小时，完成了全县所有钢铁厂的架线任务，实现了钢铁基地电路网路化。10月上旬，四川万县专区一百二十万钢铁大军日夜奋战，地委、县委书记深入高炉群指挥战斗，邮电部门就立即为他们配备了流动会议电话机和电话机。许多邮电局还派专门人员带着会议电话机，跟随党委书记流动，使书记和其他领导干部能随时召开电话会议，检查工作、布置任务。为了保证通信畅通无阻，很多邮电局的党支部书记和局长在生产现场办公，住在机房、电报房和电话房，和职工一起加强机线设备维护工作，搞好通信协作，改进操作技术，因而大大地提高了设备利用率。如山东省的电路利用率由30％左右，提高到50％左右。四川省提高电路利用率的效果，等于增加了30％的电路。
    为了保证钢铁通信，各地邮电部门进一步明确了业务必须为政治服务的思想，废除了很多陈旧的规章制度。如按照原来的规定，用户要架电话都得先缴工料费，但在钢铁通信中就突破了这个规定。在通信次序上，全国各地都把钢铁电话优先接通。
    通过保证钢铁通信的战斗，也破除了对邮电技术的神秘观点，彻底地驳倒了“我国邮电职工只能维护通信设备，不能制造通信设备”的谬论。不懂技术的职工也大搞创造发明，没有搞过制造的也大搞制造。在“自力更生，不作伸手派”的思想指导下，大批通信设备被不断地生产出来。如吉林省邮电企业在两个月内，就制造出他们从来没有制造过的单路载波机一百四十部。从来没有见过载波机的河北省昌黎县邮电局的机务员王付英，经过一百九十次的试验，也制成了载波机。河南新乡专区钢铁工地需要在三天中安装三千部电话机，全专区邮电企业没有这些话机，就连夜赶制，按期完成了任务。
    各地邮电局还根据钢铁生产的需要，及时调整了邮路，派出“随军邮电局”和流动服务人员，用最快的速度传递钢铁大军的报刊和邮件。一般的都做到每天一班，有的做到一天几班投递。邮电服务人员深入钢铁工地、食堂、宿舍，做到“信报送到高炉旁”保证钢铁大军的精神食粮。四川、云南、江苏、安徽等省，改进了邮运工具，或者实行昼夜兼程的运输办法，加快报刊和邮件的传递速度，使很多县、市能看到当天的省报。在冬季来临的时候，为了钢铁大军穿得暖，邮电职工千方百计地把棉衣包裹及时地送到钢铁前线。如河北省邯郸、峰峰矿区、邢台、沙河等邮电局，由局长带领职工用排子车、自行车把两千多件邮包送到高炉前，他们的口号是：“随来随送，绝不积压”，钢铁战士称他们是：“雪里送炭、寒里送暖”。
    目前，钢铁基地的邮电通信网仅是基本形成，还不能完全满足钢铁生产的需要。同时在前一个时期，由于钢铁生产对邮电通信要求的多，要求的快，邮电部门力量有限，所以在通信建设上采取临时性的措施较多，通信质量不高。为了适应钢铁基地化、生产工厂化的新形势，各地邮电部门在积极进行邮电建设的同时，正在大力进行通信网路的改进和提高的工作，并增设固定的服务局所，使邮电通信更好地适应钢铁生产的需要，为不断大跃进的工农业生产服务。“我也来了！”
