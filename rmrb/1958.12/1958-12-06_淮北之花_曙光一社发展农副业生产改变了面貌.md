Huaihai Flower
    —Shuguang First Cooperative Develops Agricultural and Sideline Production, Changing its Appearance
    By Our Correspondents Shi Zhengzhang and Chen Liyan

    The Huaihai Plain in the past was a miserable, disaster-prone place, and the Shuguang First Cooperative in Woyang County was the most miserable part of this miserable place. Here, the land was low-lying with poor soil quality, "Three heavy rains flood the villages, ten days without rain dries into a lake," and "Alkali wasteland is everywhere, crops don't grow when planted." This place, because it has consistently implemented the policy of attaching importance to both agriculture and sideline production since liberation, the lives of the members have gradually become prosperous. Today, it has completely changed its impoverished appearance and is praised by people as "a flower of Huaihai!"
    A folk rhyme is circulating here: "Granaries are full of grain, fish ponds abound; pigs and sheep fill the pens, cattle and horses are tethered to trees; fruits are available all year round, chicken, duck, and fish meat are common in the home."
    Don't think that this folk rhyme is sung by the members of the Shuguang First Cooperative to praise a beautiful future; they are singing about today. Take a look at their achievements in agricultural and sideline production this year! On average, each person has 2,800 catties of grain, two pigs, 0.9 sheep, nine chickens, ten catties of eggs, 316 catties of fish, and nearly 300 catties of fruit. Each household also has sixteen ducks, and every two households have a head of cattle or horses and other large draft animals. In addition, this cooperative also produced more than 10,000 catties of silkworm cocoons, raised more than 100 boxes of bees, 600 rabbits, and planted a lot of water caltrop, lotus roots, and so on. Of the 1,006 households here, every family has a surplus, and seven or eight out of ten families have money deposited in the credit cooperative.
    Snowballing

    How great are the benefits of engaging in sideline production and commodity production? The members of the Shuguang First Cooperative feel it the most deeply. They all say that engaging in sideline production overcame disasters, supported agriculture, improved living standards, and consolidated and developed cooperative organizations. It's a long story: Eight years ago, a major flood occurred here. The farmers, relying on state relief grain and funds, organized to engage in sideline production, forming fishing groups, oil pressing groups, flour milling groups, and firewood collecting groups, initially just to make a living. But after the wheat harvest in 1951, problems kept arising. Some wealthy farmers proposed the fallacy that "sideline production is not sustainable" almost every year, attempting to divide the sideline production funds in order to dissolve the cooperative and go it alone. At that time, the Party organization did not adopt their opinions, but persuaded and educated the masses while insisting on relying on existing sideline production assets, constantly expanding sideline production with the "snowball" method. As a result, the public accumulation created by engaging in sideline production became more and more. The wealthy farmers wanted to break up the cooperative, but they became increasingly reluctant to part with the growing public property. Thus, the mutual aid team was consolidated, and a primary cooperative was established in 1953, which was transformed into an advanced cooperative in 1955. With the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, sideline production also expanded year by year. Before the establishment of the people's commune in August this year, the value of sideline production and industry in the first eight months alone was more than 560,000 yuan.
    Strongly Supports Industry and Agriculture

    The fact that sideline production in the Shuguang First Cooperative has grown and strengthened not only proves that sideline production is "sustainable," but also that it strongly supports agriculture. Half of the land here is poor. By raising a large number of pigs to accumulate manure, the sandy gravel land has also been improved. They draw money from sideline production every year to support agriculture. In the first eight months of this year alone, they withdrew 140,000 yuan in sideline production funds to purchase tractors, water pumps, agricultural machinery, fertilizers, as well as draught cattle, carts, small farm tools, etc., ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. The farmers all say: Sideline production is a "small bank." With sideline production, there is no worry about capital for developing agriculture. Here, agriculture and sideline production have become intertwined, constantly promoting each other. They use agricultural products to make a variety of commodities such as vermicelli, wine, vinegar, and tofu, and use residues, leaves, stalks, and stems to develop the breeding industry.
    From Little to Much

    The sideline production of the Shuguang First Cooperative has grown from small to large, from nothing to something, and is also the result of constantly fighting against conservative ideas. In 1950, in addition to raising a small number of cattle, pigs, sheep, and chickens, other sideline production was blank. In 1956, when the "eight raising" (raising pigs, cattle, sheep, silkworms, fish, poultry, rabbits, and bees) and "ten roots" (planting mulberry trees, fruit trees, reeds, brambles, willow branches, cattails, lotus roots, water caltrop, daylilies, and castor beans) plan, with pig raising as the backbone, was proposed, it was met with resistance from various conservative ideas. For example, regarding fish farming, conservatives said, "The soil in Huaihai is too alkaline, and fish cannot survive"; regarding brick and tile burning, they said, "The soil in Huaihai is too poor to burn"; regarding planting lake mulberry, they said, "Southern trees cannot survive when planted in Huaihai"…. In order to overcome various conservative ideas with facts, the Party organization selected Party members and activists to conduct typical experiments in everything. After success, they held on-site meetings to let those who did not believe it see for themselves. As a result, fish farms have been established here, where fish were never raised in the past. This year, the sale of fish fry to other cooperatives alone is worth 30,000 yuan; this cooperative never burned bricks and tiles in the past, but now it has also set up kiln factories; the lake mulberry of the south grows vigorously in Huaihai, and the ducks of the south are also swimming in the river network of Huaihai. Recently, they also broke with convention and raised silkworms in winter, which has been successful; they also hatched more than 60,000 chickens in winter, and the survival rate of chickens hatched in winter is higher than that of chickens hatched in summer.
    Now, the Shuguang First Cooperative has merged with more than 20,000 farmers in the surrounding area to form the Jilunzhai People's Commune. The Commune Party Committee has decided to inherit the excellent tradition of Shuguang First Cooperative of attaching importance to both agriculture and sideline production. While vigorously grasping agricultural production, it has arranged for sideline production in the coming winter and spring, and decided to give play to the more favorable conditions of the People's Commune to make the farmers more prosperous.

    淮北之花
    ——曙光一社发展农副业生产改变了面貌
    本报记者  石正章  陈立言
    过去的淮北平原是个多灾的苦地方，涡阳县曙光一社又是这个苦地方当中最苦的地方。这里地洼土质坏，“三场大雨淹到庄，十天不雨干到湖”，而且“周围到处是碱荒，种上庄稼它不长”。这地方，由于解放后一贯实行了既重视农业又重视副业的方针，社员生活逐渐富裕起来，今天已彻底改变了穷困面貌，而被人们称颂为“淮北一枝花”了！
    这里流传着这样一首民谣：“粮满仓，鱼成塘；猪羊满圈，牛马成群拴树上；一年四季不断水果，鸡鸭鱼肉家中常。”
    不要以为这首民谣是曙光一社社员在歌唱美好的未来，他们歌颂的就是今天。请看看他们今年农副业生产的成绩吧！每人平均有二千八百斤粮食，二头猪，零点九头羊，九只鸡，十斤蛋，三百一十六斤鱼，近三百斤水果。每户还有十六只鸭，每两户就有一头牛或马等大耕畜。此外这个社还生产了一万多斤蚕茧，养了一百多箱蜜蜂，六百多只兔子，栽了很多菱角、藕等等。这里一千零六户人家，家家都有节余，十家有七、八家在信用社里存了钱。
    雪球越滚越大
    抓副业生产、抓商品生产，好处有多大？曙光一社的社员们感受最深。他们都说，搞副业战胜了灾荒，支援了农业，改善了生活，巩固和发展了合作组织。说来话长：八年前，这里发生了大水灾，农民们凭借国家的救济粮款，组织起来搞副业，成立了打鱼组、打油组、磨粉组、打柴组，开始只图糊口活命。但到1951年麦收后，问题就不断发生了。一些富裕的农民几乎每年都提出“副业不经啃”的谬论，企图分掉副业的资金，好拆伙单干。当时党的组织没有采纳他们的意见，一面说服教育群众，一面坚持依靠已有的副业资产，以“滚雪球”的办法，不断扩大副业。结果搞副业创造的公共积累越来越多，富裕农民想散伙，但又越来越舍不得越来越大的公共财产。于是互助组巩固了下来，到1953年就办了初级社，1955年又转了高级社。随着互助合作组织的发展，副业生产也一年比一年扩大，到今年8月份成立人民公社以前，光是头八个月的副业和工业产值就有五十六万多元。
    有力支援工农业
    曙光一社副业生产发展壮大的事实，不但证明副业是“经啃”的，而且它还有力地支持了农业。这里有一半的土地是孬地，由于大量养猪积肥，把砂礓地也改良好了。他们每年都从副业中抽出钱来支援农业，仅仅在今年头八个月就抽出副业资金十四万元，购买了拖拉机、抽水机、农用药械、化肥及耕牛、大车、小农具等等，保证了今年的农业大丰收。农民们都说：副业是“小银行”，有了副业，发展农业就不愁没有本钱。在这里，农业和副业已拧成一根绳，相互不断促进。他们用农产品制成了粉丝、酒、醋、豆腐等多种商品，又用渣和叶、秆、茎等发展了饲养业。
    从少到多
    曙光一社的副业生产从小到大，从无到有，也是不断和保守思想进行斗争的结果。1950年，这里除了养很少的牛、猪、羊、鸡以外，其他副业生产都是空白。1956年提出以养猪为骨干的“八养”（养猪、牛、羊、蚕、鱼、家禽、兔、蜂）“十根”（栽桑树、果树、芦苇、荆条、柳条、蒲草、藕、菱、黄花菜、蓖麻子）计划时，就曾遭到各种保守思想的抵抗。如养鱼，保守派说：“淮北泥土碱性大，养不活”；烧砖瓦，又说“淮北土孬烧不成”；种湖桑，又说“江南树淮北栽不活”……。党组织为了用事实克服各种保守思想，就选择了党团员和积极分子，样样都先搞典型试验，成功后就开现场会，叫不相信的人去看。结果这里过去从来不养鱼，现在也办起了养鱼场。今年光是出售给外社的鱼苗就值三万元；这社过去从来不烧砖瓦，现在也办起了窑厂；江南的湖桑在淮北长得旺盛，江南的鸭子也在淮北的河网里游泳了。最近他们还打破常规，在冬天养蚕，已获得成功；在冬天孵鸡，也孵出了六万多只，而且比夏天孵的鸡成活率高。
    现在曙光一社已和周围二万多户农民并成了纪伦寨人民公社，公社党委已决定继承曙光一社既重视农业又重视副业的优良传统，在大抓农业生产的同时，安排了今冬明春的副业生产，决定发挥人民公社更有利的条件，使农民更加富裕。
