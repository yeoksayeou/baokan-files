Youthful Teachers and Students with Good Ideology Promote Rapid Train Speeds
Tangshan Railway Institute Creates New Track Structure

(Reported by this newspaper) A new type of track structure, a monolithic track bed with longitudinal sleepers and sleeper plates, a first in China's railway construction history, was recently successfully designed by the Track Structure Teaching and Research Group at Tangshan Railway Institute. This is a new achievement in railway science and technology obtained under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways and the Party Committee of Tangshan Railway Institute, under the guidance of Soviet experts, implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, and realizing the principle of scientific research serving production. With the cooperation of the Tangshan Engineering Section of the Ministry of Railways, it has been officially laid and is in operation on the main line of Tangshan Station on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway. After operation, it has been proven that the performance and quality of this new type of track structure are good.

This new type of track structure is rare in the world. For more than 130 years since the advent of railways, steel rails have been fastened to wooden sleepers perpendicular to the track, with the sleepers laid transversely on the roadbed. Could the transverse sleepers be changed to longitudinal ones laid under the steel rails? Could concrete blocks be used to replace wooden sleepers? Could prefabricated components be used to replace ballast? Few people had thought about or studied these questions in the past. When the Track Structure Teaching and Research Group of Tangshan Railway Institute proposed their own designed new type of track structure, it was once considered "adventurous" by some railway engineering technicians. They raised many technical difficulties, attempting to stump this new type of design. However, this did not stump this group of daring and capable young teachers and students. With the firm support of the Party Committee and the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, they finally succeeded in the design.

This monolithic track bed with longitudinal sleepers and sleeper plates has many advantages. It can save a large amount of steel and completely eliminate the use of wood. It is a stable and solid foundation that can greatly increase train speeds. It has already passed fully loaded freight trains at 80 kilometers per hour, and the speed can be increased to more than 150 kilometers per hour. It makes the train run smoothly and passengers comfortable. It also makes maintenance work easier, reducing or eliminating the heavy manual labor of tamping the track bed, replacing sleepers, and cleaning the track bed. It can reduce the resistance of locomotive starting and increase the traction tonnage of the locomotive.

Currently, this new type of track structure is on display at the National Exhibition on Combining Education with Productive Labor in Beijing. Tangshan Railway Institute is continuing to study and improve this new type of track structure, designing seamless joints, and using ductile iron rails embedded in different types of monolithic track beds and longitudinal sleepers. They are also studying the laying of turnouts on monolithic track beds and other issues, in order to further increase train speeds and promote the leap-forward development of the railway industry.

### 青年师生思想好  促使火车飞快跑  唐山铁道学院创造新道轨结构

    青年师生思想好  促使火车飞快跑
    唐山铁道学院创造新道轨结构
    本报讯  我国铁路建筑历史上首创的一种新型轨道结构——整体道床、纵向轨枕和轨枕板，最近在唐山铁道学院线路构造教研组设计成功。这是在铁道部和唐山铁道学院党委领导下，在苏联专家指导下，贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，实现了科学研究为生产服务的原则而取得的铁道科学技术的新成就。在铁道部唐山工务段的协作下，已在京山线唐山车站正线线路上正式铺设行车。行车后，证明这种新型轨道结构性能质量良好。
    这种新型轨道结构在世界上目前还很少。自从世界上有了铁路的一百三十多年以来，一直是将钢轨扣放在垂直于轨道的木枕上，把轨枕横放在道床上。能不能把横放的轨枕改为纵向铺在钢轨下面？能不能用混凝土块来代替枕木？能不能用整块的预制构件来代替道碴？这些问题过去很少有人去思索和研究。当唐山铁道学院线路构造教研组提出了自己设计的新型轨道型式时，曾经被某些铁道工程技术人员认为是“冒进”。他们曾提出了许多技术上的难题，企图难倒这种新型设计。但是这并难不倒这群敢想敢干的青年师生们，他们在党委的坚决支持和苏联专家的热情指导下，终于设计成功了。
    这种整体道床、纵向轨枕和轨枕板的优点很多。它可以大量地节约钢材，完全不用木材。它是一种稳定而坚固的基础，可以大大提高列车速度。现在已经通过了每小时八十公里的满载货车，还可以提高速度到每小时一百五十公里以上。使行车平稳，乘客舒适。它还可以使维修工作易于进行，减轻或消除了捣固道床，更换枕木，清洁道床等繁重的体力劳动。可以降低机车起动的阻力，提高机车的牵引吨数。
    目前，这种新型轨道结构已在北京全国教育与生产劳动相结合展览会上展出。唐山铁道学院正在继续研究改进这种新型轨道结构，设计无冲击接缝的，以及用球墨铸铁铁轨嵌入的不同类型的整体道床和纵向轨枕，并研究在整体道床上的铺设道岔等问题，以更高地提高列车速度，促进铁道事业的飞跃发展。（附图片）
