Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 24th: The New Year and Spring Festival are approaching, and Shanghai's water and land transportation lines are stepping up the transfer of various daily necessities for urban and rural residents to celebrate the holidays.

In the past week, on the long sea route between Dalian and Wenzhou, ships have been constantly traveling back and forth, carrying an average of about 3,500 tons of daily-use industrial products, non-staple foods, and local specialties every day. A batch of small sea vessels has set off for the Shengsi and Zhoushan fishing grounds to specially transport seafood for urban residents to eat during the holidays. On the Yangtze River route, in the past seven days, nine cargo ships have sailed directly from Shanghai to ports in Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu, carrying more than 3,000 tons of general merchandise and sundries for the rural areas there.

Railway transportation has become even busier recently, with trains continuously transporting non-staple foods from rural areas along the lines. Since the second half of the month, an average of more than 1,000 tons of meat, eggs, fresh fish, vegetables, and North-South goods have been transported to cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang every day. Industrial products from cities along the line are also continuously being sent to the countryside, with an average of about 1,300 tons departing from Shanghai every day. In addition to general merchandise, fabrics, and knitwear that rural areas everywhere often need, there are also plum red paper, paper decorations, children's toys, as well as *huqin* (Chinese fiddle), *xiao* (vertical bamboo flute), and *dizi* (bamboo flute), and other items for celebrating the holidays.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: Since the beginning of December, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration has given priority to shipping the necessities of people's lives, and has been continuously transporting large quantities of grain, live pigs, frozen meat, and fruit produced in the Southwest to Wuhan, Shanghai, and the Northeast. Salted fish and daily-use general merchandise shipped from Shanghai and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have also arrived in Wuhan one after another. Tianjin Lu salt, Qingdao Qing salt, and Lianyungang Huai salt have also arrived in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan provinces in batches via sea and river transportation, basically guaranteeing the salt needs for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.

Since the second half of November, especially since December, the Yangtze River shipping departments have put the transportation of people's necessities in an important position. For many urgently needed materials, vegetables, and fruits, they have ensured that they are transported as soon as they arrive. Employees of the Yangtze River shipping departments have vigorously tapped their potential and tried every means to load more and run faster. The 2,000-horsepower same-type fleets from Wuhan to Shanghai used to take 72 to 73 hours to arrive, but now they can arrive in only 67 to 68 hours. The loading capacity has also been continuously improved. For example, there are only four special barges for loading live pigs on the entire line, which is not enough. The crew members came up with the idea of building wooden frames on ordinary barges early on to load live pigs. Recently, they built double-layered wooden frames from the bottom of the hold, and the loading capacity has doubled again. Some ships have exceptionally implemented the method of bulk or simple packaging transportation of commodities, which had never been done before, so that some commodities without hard-shell packaging can also be shipped out in time.

Recently, the Yangtze River shipping departments have also broken precedents and transshipped materials from small ports according to possible conditions. At the beginning of December, Lanxi Port in Hubei Province had more than 400 live pigs to be transported to Wuhan, but the Hubei Provincial Inland River Shipping Department lacked transportation capacity. The Yangtze River No. 301 tugboat near the port built a wooden frame and transported the batch of live pigs to Wuhan. Recently, the Yangtze River shipping departments have also urgently transported a large amount of grain and cotton from Echeng and other places in Hubei to supply cities such as Shanghai and Huangshi. Some smaller ports have also requested the Yangtze River Shipping Administration to send ships to pick up necessities, and the Yangtze River shipping departments have promptly dispatched transportation capacity to rush transportation even though these materials were not included in the transportation plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 24th: While grasping winter production, all parts of Henan Province are mobilizing the entire party and people to vigorously engage in the production, transfer, and supply of non-staple foods.

Recently, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce have held successive telephone conferences to make arrangements for all special districts and cities. Party secretaries or financial and trade ministers at all levels are personally in charge, drawing a batch of manpower and transportation resources from the steel and water conservancy fronts to invest in this work.

This year, Henan Province's main non-staple foods—pigs, fish, and vegetables—have all achieved bumper harvests. The number of pigs has doubled compared to last year, and the number of fish has increased by three and a half times. At present, 25 stations along the railway lines in the province have concentrated more than 20,000 live pigs to be transported to cities inside and outside the province. Various localities are promoting some advanced fattening methods to quickly fatten live pigs; the Grain Bureau has also allocated a batch of grain as feed for various localities to use for fattening live pigs. Professional teams for catching fish have already started large-scale fishing. In addition, the commercial departments are also actively organizing the source of goods for cigarettes, alcohol, sugar, pastries, vermicelli, firecrackers, dried and fresh fruits, as well as cultural and recreational goods, children's toys, and small general merchandise.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 24th: On the basis of completing this year's sales plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, the Shandong Provincial Commercial Department is vigorously organizing sources of goods and making preparations for the supply of materials for the New Year and Spring Festival.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has determined that from December 25th of this month to January 25th of next year will be a concentrated month for doing a good job in the production, procurement, and transfer of non-staple foods. The Teng County Commercial Bureau is organizing manpower and equipment to process and produce in large quantities locally processable commodities such as pastries, soy sauce, vinegar, *fensi* (cellophane noodles), *fenpi* (mung bean sheets), candies, colored paper, and firecrackers; and has dispatched special personnel to be responsible for increasing the source of goods for edible salt, cigarettes, alcohol, sugar, daily-use industrial products, etc. from other places.

Party committees in various parts of Shandong are also vigorously strengthening the procurement and transfer of non-staple foods, and striving to transfer more non-staple foods to support major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and the industrial and mining areas of Liaoning Province. From December 1st to 20th, a total of more than 34,000 frozen pork, live pigs, and sheep were transferred to these areas. Now, 286,000 *jin* (approximately 143 tons) of seafood fish have been transferred from Yantai and Qingdao to Beijing, more than 10 million *jin* (approximately 5,000 tons) of vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, green onions, and radishes have been transported, and more than 19 million *jin* (approximately 9,500 tons) of apples, yellow pears, and red dates have been transported. The famous Longkou *fensi* is being processed and produced, and it will soon be available for large-scale transfer to other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 23rd: All parts of Sichuan are grasping the crash transportation of commercial materials such as agricultural and sideline products with the spirit of grasping steel transportation.

The heads of the province's railway, transportation, and commercial departments have jointly formed a leading group to uniformly direct the crash transportation of commercial materials. Since the province fully launched the commercial transportation blitz on December 14th, the strength of short-distance collection and long-distance transfer has been continuously strengthened. On the major railway lines, more than 300 carriages of commercial materials have been rushed. A large number of cars are constantly being transferred from steel transportation lines to commercial transportation lines. The Provincial Steel Transportation Company has transferred 90% of its cars to Chengdu, Zigong, and other places to rush the transportation of agricultural and sideline products and various commercial materials. Nanchong, Neijiang, and other special districts have also transferred 20 to 30 cars specifically for transporting commercial materials. The commercial materials transferred to various provinces through Yangtze River shipping are also constantly increasing.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 24th: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference on the evening of the 21st, requesting all localities to complete the current stage of non-staple food supply work as an important political task to ensure that everyone has a lively New Year's holiday. From now on, all localities must take a month to focus on grasping the supply of non-staple foods with the same vigor as grasping steel production.

The meeting put forward the allocation tasks for 14 kinds of staple and non-staple foods, such as grain, live pigs, edible oil, fish, and vegetables, to various localities, requiring all localities to fully mobilize the masses through a thorough investigation and calculation to ensure the completion of the external transfer task. First, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the external transfer task assigned by the central government, and at the same time arrange the supply of small and medium-sized cities in the province and take care of the needs of the people's communes themselves. At the same time, it is necessary to grasp transportation work, especially water and road transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 24th: Anhui Province has recently launched a vigorous commercial material transportation blitz. Within ten days in mid-December, more than 11,200 live pigs and more than 27,000 tons of cotton have been shipped out to support Shanghai, and a total of more than 120,000 tons of agricultural and sideline products transported to cities and industrial products transported to rural areas. Some materials that were originally in short supply in the province have now begun to ease.

A total of 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in this transportation blitz, including workers, farmers, cadres, students, and street residents; the tools used ranged from cars to bicycles, from ships to large wooden basins, totaling tens of thousands of vehicles (vessels). In order to direct this intense transportation work, party and government leading organs constantly used telephones to deploy, and sent a large number of cadres to be stationed at stations and docks in order to achieve unified steps with the transportation departments. In grass-roots units, party secretaries and heads of commercial departments in many areas also personally participated in on-site command.

    四面八方赶运副食品进城
    水路连陆路  长途接短途
    上  海
    据新华社上海24日电  新年和春节就要到来，上海的水陆运输干线正在加紧为城乡居民调运欢度节日的各种生活必需品。
    一周来，大连——温州间漫长的海运线上，船只往返不断，载运的日用工业品、副食品和土特产品，平均每天在三千五百吨左右。一批小型海轮已奔赴嵊泗和舟山渔场，专程给城市居民载运节日食用的海鲜。在长江航线上，最近七天内有九艘货船从上海直航四川、湖南、江西和江苏的港口，为那里的农村载去了三千多吨百货和杂货。
    铁路运输近来更加繁忙，列车源源将沿线农村的副食品外运。下半月以来，平均每天有一千多吨肉类、蛋品、鱼鲜、蔬菜、南北货等，运向上海、北京、天津、沈阳等城市。沿线城市的工业品也不断下乡，平均每天从上海启运的就在一千三百吨左右。其中除了各地农村经常需要的百货、布匹、针棉织品以外，还有梅红纸、纸拉花、儿童玩具，以及胡琴、箫笛等欢度节日的用品。
    武  汉
    新华社武汉讯  长江航运管理局从12月初以来优先装运人民生活必需品，已经把西南出产的大批粮食、生猪、冻肉、水果源源运往武汉、上海和东北等地，从上海和长江下游运出的咸鱼和日用百货也纷纷到达武汉。天津芦盐、青岛青盐和连云港淮盐，也经过海、河运输一批批地到达江苏、江西、安徽、湖北和湖南等省，基本上保证了工农业生产和人民生活用盐的需要。
    自从11月下半月特别是12月以来，长江航运部门就把人民生活必需品的运输提到重要的地位，对于许多需要急运的物资和蔬菜、水果等，都做到了随到随运。长江航运部门职工大力挖掘潜力，想尽办法多装快跑。从武汉到上海的二千马力的同类型船队，过去要七十二到七十三小时才能到达，现在只要六十七到六十八小时就可以到达。装载量也不断提高。例如，装运生猪的专用驳船全线只有四艘，不够用，船员们很早就想法在普通驳船上搭起木架，装载生猪；最近他们又从舱底搭起双层木架，装载量又提高了一倍。有的船只破例实行了过去从没有过的商品散装或简装运输的办法，使某些商品没有硬壳包装也能及时运出。
    长江航运部门最近以来还打破先例，根据可能条件，转运小港的物资。12月初，湖北兰溪港有四百多头生猪要运往武汉，但湖北省内河航运部门缺乏运力，在附近港口的长江三○一拖轮就搭起木架，把这批生猪运抵武汉。最近，长江航运部门还从湖北鄂城等地急运了大批粮食、棉花，供应上海、黄石等城市。有的较小的港口也要求长江航运管理局派船接运生活必需品，长江航运部门虽然没有把这些物资列入运输计划，也都及时调派运力赶运。
    河  南
    据新华社郑州24日电  河南省各地在抓冬季生产的同时，全党全民动手大搞副食品生产、调运和供应工作。
    近日来，中共河南省委、河南省商业厅连续召开电话会议，向各专区、各市进行布置。各级党委书记或财贸部长都亲自挂帅，从钢铁、水利战线上抽调一批人力和运输力量投入这一工作。
    今年河南省主要的副食品——猪、鱼、蔬菜等都获得丰产。猪的数量比去年增加了一倍，鱼类增加了三倍半。目前省内铁路沿线有二十五个车站已集中了二万多头生猪，待运省内外各城市。各地正在推广一些先进的育肥方法，迅速育肥生猪；粮食厅也拨发了一批粮食作饲料，供各地育肥生猪用。捕捞鱼类的专业队已经开始大量捕捞。此外，商业部门还在积极组织烟酒食糖、糕点、粉条、鞭炮、干鲜果以及文娱用品、儿童玩具、小百货等商品的货源。
    山  东
    据新华社济南24日电 山东省商业部门在提前超额完成今年销货计划的基础上，正在大力组织货源，做好新年和春节的物资供应准备工作。
    中共山东省委已确定从本月25日到明年1月25日作为作好副食品生产、采购、调运工作的突击月。滕县商业局对于当地可以加工的商品，如糕点、酱油、醋、粉丝、粉皮、糖果、色纸、鞭炮等，正组织人力和设备大批加工生产；并派专人负责，增加从外地进货的食盐、烟、酒、食糖、日用工业品等货源。
    山东各地党委还在大力加强副食品的采购、调运工作，努力争取多调出一些副食品支援北京、天津、上海等大城市和辽宁省工矿区。从12月1日到20日，调往这些地区的冻猪肉、生猪、羊共有三万四千多头，现在又从烟台、青岛向北京调运了海鲜鱼二十八万六千多斤，白菜、大葱、萝卜等蔬菜运出了一千多万斤，苹果、黄梨、红枣运出了一千九百多万斤，著名龙口粉丝正在加工生产，不久以后就可以大量向外调运。
    四  川
    新华社成都23日电 四川各地以抓钢铁运输的精神，大抓农副产品等商业物资的突击运输。
    全省铁路、交通、商业等部门的负责人已经联合组成领导小组，统一指挥商业物资的突击运输。从12月14日全省全面开展商业运输突击战以来，短途集运和长途转运力量不断加强。各条铁路干线上，抢运商业物资的车皮已达三百多节。大批汽车源源不断地从钢铁运输线转入商业运输线。省钢铁运输公司已将90％的汽车转入成都、自贡等地，突击运输农副产品以及各种商业物资。南充、内江等专区也都抽调了二、三十辆汽车，专门运输商业物资。通过长江航运调往各省的商业物资也在不断增加。湖  南
    据新华社长沙24日电中共湖南省委在21日晚上召开电话会议，要求各地把现阶段的副食品供应工作当作一个重要的政治任务来完成，保证让大家热热闹闹地过好年节。各地从现在起要用一个月的时间，突出地以抓钢铁生产的劲头来抓副食品的供应工作。
    会议向各地提出了粮食、生猪、食油、鱼、蔬菜等十四种主食品和副食品的调拨任务，要求各地通过摸底算账，全面安排，充分发动群众，保证外调任务的完成，首先要保证完成中央分配的外调任务，同时安排好省内中小城市的供应和照顾到人民公社本身的需要。同时要抓好运输工作，特别是水运和公路运输。
    安  徽
    新华社合肥24日电 安徽省最近开展了声势浩大的商业物资运输突击战。在12月中旬的十天内，已运出生猪一万一千二百多头，棉花二万七千多吨支援上海，运往城市的农副业产品和运往农村的工业品总共达十二万多吨。省内原来某些供应紧张的物资，现已开始缓和。
    参加这场运输突击战的共有一、二十万人，他们中有工人、农民、干部、学生，也有街道居民；动用的工具从汽车到自行车，从轮船到大木盆，共有数万辆（只）。为了指挥这场紧张的运输工作，党政领导机关不断地用电话来部署，并派出大批干部驻在车站、码头，以便与交通运输部门取得统一的步调。在基层单位，许多地区的党委书记和商业部门的负责人，也都亲自到现场参加指挥。（附图片）
