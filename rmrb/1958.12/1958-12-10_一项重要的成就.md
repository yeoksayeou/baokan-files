    An Important Achievement
    What a touching story it is that a doctor endured pain and risked danger, using himself as a test subject, in order to relieve the suffering of patients! Now, Yang Fuzhi, of the Tianmen County People's Hospital in Hubei, has done this and succeeded, bringing happiness to many deaf-mute patients. Yang Fuzhi's spirit has established an excellent work style of serving patients. This is the first important significance of this news.
    This news also has another important significance: modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, once combined, can produce miraculous effects. Traditional Chinese medicine books clearly state that certain points are "forbidden points" and should not be deeply punctured or treated with moxibustion. However, Yang Fuzhi insisted on touching the depths of the "forbidden points." His basis was Western medical anatomy and electrotherapy. Applying certain scientific principles and methods of Western medicine to the study of Chinese acupuncture has developed acupuncture and enriched modern medicine. This has created a new national medicine that combines Chinese and Western medicine, making another flower bloom in medicine.

    一项重要的成就
    为了解除病人的痛苦，一个医生忍着疼痛，冒着危险，用自身来做试验，这是多么令人感动的事迹！现在，湖北天门县人民医院的杨辅之同志这样做了，并且成功了，给许多聋哑患者带来了幸福。杨辅之的精神，树立了为病人服务的优良作风。这是这条新闻的第一个重要意义。
    这条新闻还有另一方面的重要意义：现代医学和祖国传统医学一经结合，就可以产生奇效。中医书上明明写着是“禁穴”，不能深刺，不能灸疗。杨辅之却偏要去触动“禁穴”的深处。他的根据就是西医的解剖学和电疗。把西医的某些科学原理和方法用于研究祖国的针灸，发展了针灸学，也丰富了现代医学，这就创造了中西合璧的祖国新医学，使医药学中又开了一朵鲜花。
