Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 19th: Jiangxi Province has launched a commercial crash transportation week. In three days, 65,000 tons of goods were transported, accounting for nearly half of the province's goods awaiting shipment. Large quantities of agricultural and sideline products, industrial raw materials, and daily industrial goods were brought into cities and sent to the countryside, ensuring a smooth flow of materials.

Since mid-November, Jiangxi Province has successively transferred more than 140,000 tons of grain, cotton, jute, non-staple food, and other industrial raw materials and daily industrial goods. These materials are concentrated in stations, ports, and other major land and water transportation hubs awaiting shipment. In order to quickly bring these materials into cities and the countryside, especially to support the needs of large cities and industrial areas such as Shanghai, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to launch a commercial crash transportation week from December 15th, extracting 50% to 60% of its transportation capacity while ensuring steel transportation.

Currently, a massive crash transportation campaign has reached its climax. On the province's land and water transportation lines, vehicles and ships are like swift arrows, rushing from stations and ports to cities and villages.

    江西展开突击运输周
    据新华社南昌19日电  江西省开展商业突击运输周，三天突击运送物资六万五千吨，占全省待运物资近一半。大批农副产品、工业原料和日用工业品进城下乡，物资畅流。
    11月中旬以来，江西省先后调集的粮食、棉花、黄麻、副食品以及其他工业原料和日用工业品，已达十四万多吨，这些物资都集中在车站、港口等水陆交通要道待运。为了使这批物资迅速进城下乡，特别是支援上海等大城市和工业区的需要，中共江西省委决定从12月15日起，在保证钢铁运输的前提下，抽出50％到60％的运力，开展一个商业突击运输周。
    目前，一个声势浩大的突击运输运动已达高潮。全省水陆交通线上，车船像一支支快箭，从车站、港口急急射往城市、乡村。
