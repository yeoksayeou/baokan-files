According to the Hubei Daily, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an on-site meeting on tool reform and the mechanical industry in Guanghua County at the end of November, summarizing and promoting Guanghua County's experience in establishing an agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair network. The attendees included secretaries of local and county party committees and cadres in charge of the mechanical industry and tool reform.

The comrades who attended first visited Guanghua County's local state-owned Agricultural Tool Factory No. 1, Factory No. 2, Ball Bearing Factory, and the Bai Lian People's Commune's August 1st Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory. Some factories originally had a very weak foundation, and some were completely newly established. For example, Agricultural Tool Factory No. 2 only had four old hand-cranked lathes that were more than 30 years old in 1956, but now has 45 various machine tools. They broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, and used the method of "ants gnawing bones, chicks hatching big eggs" to manufacture a 12-foot gantry planer, a 12-foot lathe, a 12-horsepower diesel engine, and various specifications of lathes, planers, drilling machines, power machines, steelmaking furnaces, and rolling mills. They also manufactured a large number of simple lathes and ball bearings, not only equipping themselves but also equipping the agricultural machinery repair factories of various people's communes and large teams. Now, all eight people's communes in the county have established eight relatively large agricultural machinery repair factories with more than ten lathes. Large teams that are far from market towns have also established 117 small agricultural tool repair stations with three to five lathes each. In this way, a roughly scaled mechanical manufacturing and repair network has been formed throughout the county. With this network, the ball bearing implementation has been consolidated and improved, and various tool reforms have been carried out smoothly, laying the foundation for the realization of agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization.

The comrades who attended the meeting in Guanghua also saw new tools created by the masses, such as horse-drawn trains, pedal-powered four-wheeled vehicles, "flipping the wall" silk reeling machines, pedal boats, rope traction machines, and so on. In Guanghua County, whether it is industry, agriculture, commerce, post and telecommunications, hospitals, schools, or government agencies, everyone is running factories, and everyone is trying to carry out various tool reforms. The impression is that a high tide of technical revolution has begun to appear in Guanghua County.

After visiting and discussing, the comrades who attended the meeting unanimously agreed that it is necessary to follow the path of Guanghua, rely on and mobilize the masses, rely on their own efforts, arm themselves, and vigorously develop the mechanical industry. Many comrades also combined this with a review of past reliance solely on external assistance, reaching out everywhere, waiting passively, and not believing in the masses, and other erroneous ideas. The comrades from Enshi Prefecture reviewed their past erroneous ideas about developing the mechanical industry: first, "waiting," not relying on their own efforts to build machine tools, but waiting for the higher levels to issue them; second, "grabbing," sending hundreds of people outside to purchase them, but machine tools were needed everywhere, and they could not be purchased; third, "blocking," blocking any machine tools they encountered; fourth, "calling," calling above when there was no other way. Why not rely on self-reliance? The main reason was the existence of mystical views, believing that mechanical equipment could not be made by oneself. During the meeting, most prefectures and counties drafted preliminary plans for tool reform and the establishment of mechanical manufacturing and repair networks.

Finally, Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a summary at the meeting. He requested that all localities immediately formulate plans, strengthen leadership, and launch a competition movement to "learn from Guanghua, catch up with Guanghua, and surpass Guanghua," to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification.

    光化县建立农具修造网
    给自力更生大搞工具改革创造了好条件
    据湖北日报消息  11月底中共湖北省委在光化县召开了工具改革和机械工业现场会，总结和推广光化县建立农具机械制造修配网的经验。到会的有各地、县委书记和管机械工业、工具改革的干部。
    到会的同志首先参观了光化县地方国营农具第一厂、第二厂、滚珠轴承厂、白莲人民公社的八一农业机械修配厂。有的厂原来基础十分薄弱，有的完全是新建立起来的。如农具二厂在1956年只有用了三十年以上的四部旧手摇车床，现在已有各种机床四十五台。他们破除了迷信，解放了思想，用“蚂蚁啃骨头，小鸡孵大蛋”的办法制造了一丈二尺的龙门刨床，一丈二尺的车床，十二匹马力的柴油机和各种规格的车床、刨床、钻床、动力机、炼钢炉、轧钢机，还制造了大批简易车床和滚珠轴承，不仅武装了自己，而且装备了各人民公社和大队的农具机械修配厂。现在全县八个人民公社已建立了八个规模较大的有十部以上车床的农具机械修配厂。离集镇较远的大队也分别建立了有三到五部车床的一百一十七个小型农具修配站。这样在全县就组成了一个粗具规模的机械制造修配网。有了这个网就把滚珠轴承化巩固提高了一步，顺利进行了各项工具改革，为实现农业半机械化、机械化打下了基础。
    到会同志在光化还看了群众创造的马拉列车、脚踏四轮车、翻墙滑丝、脚踏船、绳索牵引机等等新式工具。光化县无论是工业、农业、商业、邮电、医院、学校、机关，都在办工厂，人人都在想办法进行各种各样的工具改革。给人的印象是：在光化全县范围内已经开始出现一个技术革命的高潮。
    到会同志经过参观讨论，一致认为必须走光化的道路，依靠和发动群众，自力更生，自己武装自己，大办机械工业。许多同志并结合检查了过去单纯依靠外援，四处伸手，消极等待，不相信群众等等错误思想。恩施专区的同志检查过去对兴办机械工业的错误思想，一是“等”，不是自力更生造机床，而是等上级发给；二是“抓”，派几百人到外面去采购，可是到处都需要机床，采购不到；三是“拦”，碰到有机床就拦住；四是“叫”，没办法就向上面叫。为什么不自力更生呢，主要存在着神秘观点，认为机械设备不能自造。会议期间，大多数专、县订出了关于工具改革和建立机械制造修配网的初步规划。
    会议最后由中共湖北省委书记处书记王延春同志作了总结。他要求各地立即订出规划，加强领导，开展一个“学光化、赶光化、超光化”的竞赛运动。加速农业机械化和电气化的实现。
