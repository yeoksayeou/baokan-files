Xinhua News Agency, Canberra, 10th. Buganda's Parliament recently passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the so-called "protectorate" agreement used by Britain to enslave the people of Buganda.

    The resolution states: "The local parliament has decided that the time has now come to send a letter to (the British) Queen notifying her of the abolition of the agreement concluded with her and the return of the protection conferred upon her."

    Parliament has appointed a five-person committee to draft an application to the British Queen on the issue of "Buganda's constitutional future."

    Buganda is regarded by the British colonialists as one of the four provinces of Uganda, its "protectorate." It is the largest kingdom within this "protectorate" and enjoys the status of a "native state."

    布干达要求摆脱英国奴役
    议会决议不再当英国的“保护国”
    新华社10日讯  坎伯拉消息：布干达议会最近通过一项决议，要求废除英国用来奴役布干达人民的所谓“保护国”协定。
    这项决议说：“本地议会决定，现在应该致函（英国）女王通知她废除同她缔结的协定和交还授与她的保护权的时候已经来到了。”
    议会已经任命了一个五人委员会就“布干达的立宪前途”问题草拟向英国女王提出的申请书。
    布干达被英国殖民者算作它的“保护国”乌干达的四个省份之一。它是在这个“保护国”范围内最大的王国，享有“土著国家”地位。
