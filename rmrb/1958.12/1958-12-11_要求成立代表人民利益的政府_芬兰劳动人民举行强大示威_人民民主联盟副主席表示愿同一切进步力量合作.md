Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, December 9th. Approximately 18,000 people held a demonstration and march in front of the Finnish Parliament Building in Helsinki on the 9th, demanding the establishment of a government supported by workers and small farmers that represents the interests of the people to resolve the current government crisis.

　　This demonstration was held under the call of the committee of fifty trade union organizations in Helsinki. Despite the bad weather, the demonstrators decided to take to the streets to march.

　　They passed a resolution demanding the establishment of a government composed of representatives of workers and small farmers to stop unemployment, rebuild friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and establish trade relations with socialist countries.

　　The resolution noted with satisfaction that the right-wing government, which speculated by taking advantage of the people's difficulties, unemployment, and crisis, had collapsed.

　　The resolution said, “The majority of us have passed judgment on this policy. For the benefit of the people, we put forward the following demands: Let everyone have work to prevent unemployment; make all enterprises fully operational; rely on some large entrepreneurs and the state to implement unemployment insurance; increase wages and stop price increases to increase people's purchasing power and living standards; implement a peace-loving foreign policy, develop relations based on trust with all countries, especially with our great neighbor, the Soviet Union; develop economic relations that are extremely important to Finland with socialist countries that have eliminated exploitation and unemployment.”

　　The resolution said, “Only a government supported by workers and small landowners and hoping to rescue Finland from its current predicament can implement this policy. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely prevent members of the Coalition Party and other extreme right-wing elements from participating in the new government. People from the People's Democratic League who cooperate with the progressive strata of the people should participate in the government. We demand that the government crisis be resolved in this way.”

　　The resolution also said, “We, the workers, small landowners, and other people with little property, will raise our demands again and again until the country learns to respect the will of the people.”

　　Hertta Kuusinen, Vice-Chairman of the Finnish People's Democratic League, representing the People's Democratic League—the only parliamentary group invited to speak to the demonstrators—told the demonstrators that some representatives of the Finnish People's Democratic League were prepared to participate in such a government. They will also insist on adopting a policy that conforms to the interests of the people. They are prepared to cooperate in the government with all progressive forces, but not with right-wing elements. Kuusinen said that there must be no extreme right-wing elements in the new government.

　　Trade union activist Rauhamo also spoke at the rally. He emphasized that only a government that implements the will of the people and safeguards the interests of the people can change Finland's current policy. His words were met with cheers and applause.

　　Among those who participated in the demonstration were some worker delegations from all regions of Finland who came to Helsinki.

　　The demonstrators also issued an appeal to various labor groups and progressives in Finland, urging them to be wary of the danger of right-leaning.

　　The meeting ended with the singing of the Internationale.

    要求成立代表人民利益的政府
    芬兰劳动人民举行强大示威
    人民民主联盟副主席表示愿同一切进步力量合作
    新华社赫尔辛基9日电  大约有一万八千人9日在赫尔辛基议会大厦前举行了示威和游行，要求成立一个得到工人和小农支持的、代表人民利益的政府来解决目前的政府危机。
    这次示威是在赫尔辛基五十个工会组织委员会的号召之下举行的。尽管天气很坏，示威者仍然决定上街去游行。
    他们通过了一项决议，要求成立一个由工人和小农的代表组成的政府来制止失业、同苏联重建友好关系和同社会主义国家建立贸易关系。
    决议中满意地指出，利用人民的困难、失业和危机而投机的右翼政府垮台了。
    决议说，我们大多数的人都对这种政策作出了判决。为了人民的利益，我们提出下列要求：让所有的人都有工作以防止失业现象；使所有的企业全部开工；依靠一些大企业家和国家实行失业保险；提高工资和制止物价上涨以提高人民的购买力和生活水平；实行爱好和平的外交政策，同一切国家，首先是同我们伟大的邻国苏联发展以信任为基础的关系；同消灭了剥削和失业的社会主义国家发展对芬兰极其重要的经济关系。
    决议说，只有得到工人和小土地所有者支持的和希望把芬兰从现在的困境中拯救出来的政府才能实行这种政策。因此，应该坚决防止联合党人和其他极右分子参加新政府。参加政府的应该是同人民进步阶层合作的人民民主联盟人士。我们要求这样解决政府危机。
    决议还说，我们工人、小土地所有者和其他财产少的人，将要一次又一次地提出我们的要求，直到国内学会尊重人民意志的时候为止。
    芬兰人民民主联盟副主席赫塔尔·库西宁代表人民民主联盟——接受邀请向示威者讲话的唯一议会党团——向示威者说，芬兰人民民主联盟的一些代表准备参加这样的政府。他们并且将坚持采取一项符合人民利益的政策。他们准备在政府中同一切进步力量合作，但是不同右翼分子合作。库西宁说，新政府中必须没有极右分子。
    工会活动家拉乌哈莫也在这次集会上讲了话。他强调指出，只有执行人民意志和维护人民利益的政府才能改变芬兰的现行政策。他的话博得了大家的欢呼和掌声。
    参加这次游行示威的有从芬兰全国各个地区来到赫尔辛基的一些工人代表团。
    示威者还向芬兰各劳动人民团体和进步人士发出呼吁，要他们提防右倾的危险。
    大会在国际歌声中结束。
