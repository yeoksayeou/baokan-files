Bourgeois Democracy Enters the Toilet
    Liang Ru Huai
    The hypocrisy of the French election suddenly reminded me of a satirical film, "Colonel Körner."

    "Colonel Körner" is a production of Democratic Germany, depicting the experiences of Albert, an unemployed waiter in West Germany, which has nothing to do with the French parliamentary elections. However, the actions of figures like De Gaulle and Soustelle always bring to mind the fascist war criminals in the film who crawled out of prisons and dark corners. This election easily brings to mind how that waiter became a member of parliament. "Colonel Körner" offers a profound analysis of West German monopoly capitalist groups and their tools—parliaments and governments. The fake colonel's experience is a true mirror, reflecting that elections and parliaments under bourgeois rule are nothing more than a deceptive trick. The French election fully confirms this point.

    The French Republic prides itself on maintaining a long democratic tradition. Although its democracy is merely a fake democracy of a minority of the bourgeoisie ruling the vast majority of the people, now that the bourgeoisie is at its end, exhausted and screaming, it doesn't even want this fig leaf anymore. The representatives of the French people—the French Communist Party—obtained 20% of the votes under restrictions and persecution, but only hold 2% of the seats. And those bourgeois parties that only cheated a small number of votes colluded and relied on ridiculous election laws to seize most of the seats. Even the "New York Herald Tribune" had to admit that "there is a surprising contradiction between the people's vote and the parliament's representation." What democracy can such a parliament have! "Colonel Körner" has the following plot: Albert, who was mistaken for a war criminal and heavily used by monopoly capitalists, was promoting the amnesty bill on the parliament podium, when the heads of the two parties below the stage had the following dialogue:
    A: If you do this, the amnesty case will not pass! Didn't we agree? ... If you really hold us back, you won't necessarily benefit!
    B: Does that need to be said? But our voters have this emotion!
    A: The voters' emotions? How much is that worth? ... Think about it! I have reliable information that your party newspaper may be shut down! If you need to find some supplements, I have a way!
    B: That would be great, but I don't know how to persuade the whole party!
    A: Not necessarily the whole party, individual abstentions, this is not afraid, and there are benefits, mainly to ensure that we get the majority!

    This political deal was negotiated in this way, the amnesty case passed, and the war criminals were all released from prison. This negotiation was carried out in the toilet, which is a clever technique of the filmmaker. Isn't that the truth? Isn't this conversation itself, together with this parliament full of political deals, as dirty and filthy and smelly as in the toilet?

    After De Gaulle played his political tricks, the French bourgeois democracy has also entered the toilet. From the perspective of the French bourgeoisie, under the strong pressure of domestic democratic forces, the development of the colonial people's struggle for independence, and the repeated failures of the bourgeoisie's reactionary policies, it had to throw out the last card of fascist dictatorship. But from the perspective of the French people, this may not be a bad thing, because the last trump card of the bourgeois rulers shows that their bets have been lost, and they have also been put on a stranglehold that cannot be freed, and the other end of the stranglehold is handed over to the French Communist Party and the French people. Those who still have illusions about bourgeois democracy can also be sobered up by the stench in the toilet.

    However, the last trump card of the French bourgeoisie, seemingly fierce, is actually just a piece of garbage! Hitler played this card, and the result was complete annihilation, even his own bones were gone; Mussolini also played this card, and the result was that his body was displayed on the streets of Milan; unexpectedly, today someone is still dreaming on the skeleton that has been abandoned by the people of the world. May I ask: Can they expect to get a better end than these predecessors?

    资产阶级民主进了厕所
    梁汝怀
    从法国的虚伪的选举，我忽然想起一部讽刺片“科伦上尉”。
      “科伦上尉”是民主德国的出品，写的是西德一个失业的招待员阿尔培特的遭遇，跟法国的国会选举并无丝毫瓜葛。可是，戴高乐、苏斯戴尔之流的行径，总是叫人想到影片里那些从监狱、从阴黯的角落爬出来的法西斯战犯们。从这一场选举中，也容易叫人联想起那个招待员怎样当上了议员。“科伦上尉”对西德垄断资本集团及其工具——议会、政府，作了深刻的解剖。假上尉的遭遇，一片真实的镜子，照出了资产阶级统治下的选举和议会，只不过是一场骗人的把戏。法国的选举，也完全印证了这一点。
    法兰西共和国自诩为保持了悠久的民主传统的，虽然它的民主，只是占少数的资产阶级管绝大多数人民的假民主，但时至今日，资产阶级日暮途穷，力竭声嘶，连这块遮羞布也不要了。法国人民的代表——法国共产党，在被限制、被迫害的情况下，获得了20％的选票，却只有2％的议席。而那些只骗得少数选票的资产阶级政党，却勾搭起来，依靠笑话奇谈的选举法，攫取了大部分的议席。连“纽约先驱论坛报”都不得不承认“在人民投票和议会的代表性之间存在着惊人的矛盾现象。”这样的议会，还能有什么民主可言！“科伦上尉”里有这么一段情节：被误认为战犯而被垄断资本家重用的阿尔培特正在议会讲坛上宣传大赦法案的时候，台下两个政党的头子有这么一段对话：
    甲：如果你们这样，那大赦案就通不过了！我们不是讲好了吗？……您要是真的拖我们后腿的话，那您也不见得会有好处！
      乙：那还用说吗？不过我们的投票人有这种情绪！
      甲：投票人的情绪？请问这值多少钱？……您考虑考虑吧！我得到了可靠情报，目前你们的党报很可能要关门大吉！如果你需要找些贴补的话，这个我有办法！乙：那再好也没有了，不过我还不知道怎么去说服全党！
    甲：不一定全党，有个别的弃权，这不怕，而且还有好处，主要是保证我们获得多数！
    这一场政治交易就这样谈妥了，大赦案通过了，战犯们统统出狱了。这场谈判是在厕所里进行的，这是电影制作者的一个巧妙的手法。事实不正是如此吗？这段谈话本身，连同这个充满了政治买卖的议会，不是跟厕所里一样地肮脏龌龊，一样地臭气冲天吗？
    在戴高乐耍了他的政治把戏之后，法兰西的资产阶级民主也已经进了厕所了。从法国的资产阶级来说，在国内民主力量的强大压力、殖民地人民要求独立斗争的发展和资产阶级的反动政策到处碰壁的情况下，它不得不抛出法西斯独裁这最后一张王牌了。但从法国人民来说，这也未尝不是一件好事，因为资产阶级统治者的这最后一张王牌，说明他们的赌注已经输光了，他们也已经套上了无法解脱的绞索，而把绞索的另一端交给法国共产党和法国人民。那些对资产阶级民主还有幻想的人，也可以被厕所里的这股臭气冲得清醒一些。
    然而法国资产阶级的这最后一张王牌，貌似很凶，其实又算得了什么货色！希特勒打过这张牌，结果全军复灭，连自己也尸骨无存；墨索里尼也打过这张牌，结果陈尸米兰街头；不料到今天还有人在这已经被全世界人民唾弃的骸骨上做好梦。试问：他们还能指望得到比这些前辈们更好的下场么？
