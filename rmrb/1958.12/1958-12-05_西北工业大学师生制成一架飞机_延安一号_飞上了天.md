Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 3rd: At 3:00 PM on December 3rd, the "Yan'an No. 1" aircraft, designed and manufactured by the faculty and students of Northwestern Polytechnical University, took to the sky.

This aircraft is a multi-purpose civil aviation aircraft that can be used for parachuting, agriculture, towing, passenger transport, transportation, and rescue. After a twenty-minute test flight, it proved that the aircraft flies smoothly and freely, with good performance and quality.

In July, the faculty and students of this university started designing this aircraft with very little available information. Initially, the design progress was very slow due to relying solely on a few teachers. The Party committee immediately proposed that the design and manufacture of the aircraft must involve a large-scale mass movement, adopting a method that combined teachers, students, and workers. The number of participants increased to over four hundred. When materials were lacking, they tried their best to find substitutes. When equipment was lacking, they manufactured it themselves. When technology was lacking, they humbly consulted veteran workers. When experience was lacking, they relied on collective research and exploration. After more than four months of day and night hard work, they finally successfully manufactured the "Yan'an No. 1" aircraft. Except for the engine, all other materials for this aircraft were designed and manufactured by the faculty and students themselves.

    西北工业大学师生制成一架飞机
    “延安一号”飞上了天
    新华社西安3日电  3日下午三时，西北工业大学师生自己设计和制造的“延安一号”飞机飞上了天。
    这架飞机是一种多种用途的民航飞机，可以做跳伞、农业、牵引、旅客、运输和救护等。经过二十分钟的试飞证明，这架飞机飞行平稳自如，性能和质量良好。
    7月间，这个大学的师生们在资料十分缺乏的情况下动手设计这架飞机。起先，由于光是依靠几个教师，设计进度很慢。党委立即提出设计和制造飞机必须大搞群众运动，采取教师、学生和工人三结合的办法来进行。参加的人数一下增加到四百多人。没有材料，他们就想尽办法找代用品。没有设备，自己制造。没有技术，虚心请教老工人。没有经验，依靠集体研究摸索。经过四个多月的日夜苦战，他们终于制造成功了“延安一号”飞机。这架飞机除了发动机以外，其余材料全部是师生们亲手设计和制造的。
