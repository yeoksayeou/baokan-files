Claws Reaching for the "Reservation"
A Glimpse of the Tragic Plight of American Indians

    In the United States, only 340,000 Indians remain. They live in small, barren, government-designated "reservations," suffering from poverty and disease. But even their last piece of land, on which they depend for survival, is constantly in danger of being taken away.

    According to the American "Workers' Weekly," near Buffalo, western New York State, live 182 families of Tuscarora Indians. Their "reservation" is only a little over 6,000 acres, mostly rocky hills or swamps, with only a little over 1,000 acres of flat land in the southwest corner suitable for cultivation. Therefore, the Tuscarora live a hard life and must find odd jobs outside the "reservation" to make a living. Not long ago, the New York State Power Authority, in order to help the electricity monopoly group build a reservoir, included this piece of farmland belonging to the Indians in the reservoir area and tried to buy it forcibly at a low price. But this farmland is the lifeline of the Indians; if they lose it, their economic lifeline will be destroyed. Therefore, the Indians resolutely refused to sell and drove away the surveying team sent by the Power Authority to forcibly measure the land. Unexpectedly, the State Department of Public Works brazenly ordered the Niagara County government to confiscate the Indians' land, and the county government even dispatched a large number of police to suppress them, arresting Indian leaders who were protecting their farmland.

    "Workers' Weekly" said that the reservoir could have been built without occupying Indian land, but the State Power Authority believed that moving the location of the reservoir would not only cost more money, but more importantly, it would flood some farms and residential areas under construction outside the "reservation." The property rights of these houses and properties all belong to mortgage companies or banks, and the State Power Authority is unwilling to touch the interests of financial capitalists. As for the Indians' land, it is exempt from taxes, and using it to build a reservoir would not affect the county government's income.

    The struggle surrounding the Tuscarora "reservation" has attracted the attention of upright people in the United States. Because, during the American War of Independence, the Tuscarora helped the revolutionary army resist the British. In order to "reward" the Tuscarora, the American government designated this "reservation" for them and stipulated in the form of a treaty that the land rights would belong to them permanently. However, despite such a treaty, it cannot stop the claws of American monopoly groups from reaching for this reservation.

### 伸向“保留地”的魔爪  美国印第安人悲惨处境的一个片断

    伸向“保留地”的魔爪
    美国印第安人悲惨处境的一个片断
    在美国，目前只剩下三十四万的印第安人，他们居住在由政府指定的面积狭小、土地贫瘠的所谓“保留地”里，过着贫病交加的痛苦生活。但是，即使这样，他们赖以生存的最后一点土地，还时时刻刻有被夺走的危险。
    据美国“工人周报”报道，在纽约州西部布法罗的附近，居住着一百八十二户印第安人杜斯卡罗拉族，他们的“保留地”只有六千多英亩，其中大部分是岩石丘陵地或沼泽，能够耕种的只有西南角的一千多英亩平地。因此，杜斯卡罗拉族的生活很苦，必须在“保留地”外面找些零碎工作做，以资糊口。不久前，纽约州电力管理局为了帮助电力垄断集团修建一座水库，就把印第安人这块耕地划入水库范围，想用低价强购。但这块耕地是印第安人的命根子，如果失去了它，他们的经济命脉就将被摧毁。于是，印第安人坚决拒绝出售，并将电力管理局派来强行测量的测量队赶走。不料，州公共工程部竟横蛮地命令尼亚卡拉县政府没收印第安人的土地，县政府还出动大批警察进行镇压，逮捕了保护自己耕地的印第安人领袖。
    “工人周报”说，本来修建水库可以不占用印第安人土地，但是州电力管理局认为挪动水库位置不仅要多花钱，更重要的，就要淹没“保留地”外面的一些农场和修建中的这些住宅区。这些房、地产权都属于抵押公司或银行所有，州电力管理局不愿触动金融资本家的利益。至于印第安人的土地是不收捐税的，用来修建水库也不影响县政府的收入。
    围绕着杜斯卡罗拉族“保留地”的斗争，引起了美国正直人士的重视。因为，在美国独立战争时，杜斯卡罗拉族曾帮助革命军反抗英国人，美国政府为了“酬谢”杜斯卡罗拉族，把这片“保留地”划给他们，并以条约形式规定土地权永久归他们所有。但是，尽管有这样的条约，并不能阻挡美国垄断集团的魔爪伸向这块保留地。
