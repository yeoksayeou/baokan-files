Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Beijing Military Region General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is earnestly implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. All personnel in the hospital, as well as more than sixty military doctors transferred from the troops, have plunged into a wave of learning traditional Chinese medicine. In late December, the hospital will also open a Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine training class to train a group of backbone personnel for the troops who are proficient in both traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

The hospital's movement to learn traditional Chinese medicine underwent full preparation and deliberation. This autumn, the hospital's Party committee required all medical and nursing staff to learn the basic theoretical knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, and to study and use commonly used, effective, and proven prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine. In October, all doctors and nurses in the hospital learned acupuncture and began clinical application. In practice, they have initially realized that there are many priceless treasures in the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine, which can not only cure diseases with medicine, save money, save trouble, and be simple, but also avoid the pain of surgery for some diseases. At present, they have basically switched to using traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of appendicitis. They also use Xiaoyao San, a traditional Chinese medicine, to treat hepatitis, which can be cured in one or two weeks. These vivid facts have given all the personnel in the hospital great enlightenment and education.

Now, from the hospital's director and political commissar to nurses and other staff, in addition to reading documents, books, and freely airing views and debating every day, they also specially hire traditional Chinese medicine doctors to give lectures. Their slogan is: Everyone should learn two sets of skills, traditional Chinese and Western medicine, to contribute to inheriting and carrying forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and creating a new Chinese medicine.

    发扬祖国医学遗产  创造祖国新医学
    北京地区部队总医院人人学中医
    新华社11日讯  中国人民解放军北京地区部队总医院认真贯彻党的中医政策，全院所有人员和从部队调来的六十多名军医，都投入了学习中医的热潮。12月下旬，这个医院还将开办西医学中医训练班，为部队培养一批中西医合璧的骨干。
    这个医院学习中医运动经过了充分的准备和酝酿。今年秋季，医院党委就要求全体医务人员、护理人员学习中医的基本理论知识，研究和使用中医的常用有效验方。10月份全院所有的医生和护士都学会了针灸，并开始临床应用。他们在实践中已经初步体会到，祖国医学宝库里有许多无价之宝，不但药到病除，省钱、省事、简便，有些疾病还可免除动手术的痛苦。目前，他们对阑尾炎已改为基本上用中药治疗了。治疗肝炎也用中药逍遥散，一两周即可痊愈。这些生动事实，都给了全院人员很大的启示和教育。
    现在，这个医院从院长、政委到护士等工作人员，每天除了阅读文件、书籍和鸣放辩论以外，还专门聘请中医授课。他们的口号是：人人学会中、西医两套本领，为继承和发扬祖国医学遗产、创造祖国新医学作出贡献。
