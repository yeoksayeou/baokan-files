    Female Vanguard on the Invisible Front
    By our reporter Hu Ruisong
    In Xilingjiazhai, Nanshi, Shanghai, there is an ordinary housewife known as "Glass Eyes" by the masses. Since liberation, she has reported a total of 148 pieces of information on counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, and has personally assisted the government in arresting 63 criminals. She is Zhou Shuiyue, the representative from Shanghai to the National Women's Congress of Active Builders of Socialism.
    Xilingjiazhai is a shantytown area. In the years of reactionary rule, it was a place where poor laborers gathered and where local ruffians and bullies ran rampant. Before liberation, many fleeing landlords and "Homecoming Legions" settled here. They gambled, stole, used drugs, and harassed women, creating a foul atmosphere in the area. At that time, Zhou Shuiyue dared to feel angry but didn't dare to speak out. After liberation, she could no longer restrain the anger in her heart and was determined to assist the government in punishing these bad elements who harmed the people.
    Zhou Shuiyue has a high level of political awareness and revolutionary vigilance, and many cunning enemies have not escaped her eyes.
    Several years ago, one winter night, she was on "Winter Defense" patrol. When she walked to Chen Wengao's house at No. 6, Lane 93, Xilingjiazhai, she heard two people talking in low voices inside. One of them said viciously, "Let's see how much longer he can be rampant..." These words, without beginning or end, immediately caught her attention. Later, it was discovered that a strange "peddler" lived in Chen Wengao's house, who sometimes sold spiced beans and sometimes switched to selling fans or children's toys; he went out very early in the morning and returned very late at night. This aroused her suspicion even more. Why didn't this peddler specialize in one business? Why did he usually hide and avoid people? She reported these situations to the police station in a timely manner. According to further investigation by the public security organs, this "peddler" was named Li Haoqing, who had previously served as an executive member of the pseudo-county party headquarters, director of the tax bureau, and chief of the intelligence section, etc., and was a counter-revolutionary who had escaped the net. This cunning enemy often appeared and disappeared, using the guise of a peddler. In order to assist the public security department in ascertaining the whereabouts of this "peddler," she often stayed up all night, paying attention to his activities day and night. One night, it was pouring rain outside, and she thought: "This is a good opportunity for counter-revolutionaries to act." So, she braved the rain and went out to continue her reconnaissance. Her clothes were soaked in the rain, and the cold rain made her shiver. One afternoon a month later, the public security personnel finally arrested this counter-revolutionary who had escaped the net based on Zhou Shuiyue's report.
    In the autumn of 1950, a one-eyed man moved into No. 20, Lane 27, Xilingjiazhai. This strange "resident" aroused Zhou Shuiyue's suspicion as soon as he moved in: he had not registered his household, had no job, slept during the day, and went out at night to "collect scraps," but he ate very well and often gambled. His eye also looked like a gunshot wound. Based on these circumstances, she concluded that this person was not a good person. One night, she returned from a meeting, it was almost twelve o'clock, and when she passed the "one-eyed" man's door, she saw that there were still lights inside. She peeked through the crack in the door and saw the "one-eye" taking a package from the roof beam, opening layers of paper, taking out a rectangular piece of paper, putting it under the light, and talking in a low voice with two other people while looking at it, saying: "Go find connections." That night, she told the police station everything she had seen. After careful investigation by the public security personnel, it was proved that this "one-eyed dragon" was named Sun Jingliang, a special agent who had sneaked into Shanghai from Zhoushan to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. The piece of paper she saw was the "special mission order" given to this special agent by the Chiang Kai-shek group.
    When it was time to arrest Sun Jingliang, the criminal suddenly disappeared. It was a dark, windy, and rainy night, with deep water and mud on the ground. Zhou Shuiyue was very angry when she saw the special agent had run away. Fearlessly, she went alone to the square near Lane 27. Just as she reached the corner, she saw a black shadow flash beside the bamboo fence in front of her, and she immediately shouted, "Who's there?" The other party also asked back, "Who are you?" As soon as she heard the accent, it was the special agent Sun Jingliang. She lunged forward. When Sun realized that it was a woman who had grabbed him, he threatened her, "Let go! If you don't let go, I'll take your life!" and punched her hard, trying to escape. The brave Zhou Shuiyue, knowing that her strength was small and she couldn't defeat the other party, thought, "If he escapes, many people will suffer. What does it matter if I, Zhou Shuiyue, die?" So, she gritted her teeth, used all her strength, and desperately grabbed Sun's clothes, refusing to let go. Seeing that the situation was not good, Sun Jingliang pushed Zhou Shuiyue down and grabbed her throat with both hands. At this critical moment, the public security personnel heard the sound and rushed over, and Sun was immediately arrested. The public security personnel then helped Zhou Shuiyue up from the water and held her hand tightly, saying excitedly, "You are really an amazing person, you have once again helped us eliminate a scourge for the people."
    Over the past few years, Zhou Shuiyue's many reports and assistance to the public security department in cracking down on special agents, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements has not only been well known to the residents near Xilingjiazhai, but has also spread among the people of the city. Many literary and art workers have visited her and turned her vivid fighting stories into poems and plays, which are sung to people in the neighborhoods and on the stage.
    What force made her so brave, strong, and clear in her stance, even at the risk of sacrificing her personal life, and unwilling to let go of a counter-revolutionary? As she herself said: It is because she hates the old society and loves the Communist Party. In the old society, she grew up in a poor peasant family. Her father was forced to death by the landlord because he could not pay the rent. Her mother could not maintain her life, so she first sold her eldest sister and then sent Zhou Shuiyue to her husband's family. She got married at the age of sixteen, but her husband was arrested by the Kuomintang army as a conscript when she was nineteen and was beaten to death. At that time, she already had three children. In that dark society under reactionary rule, how could a young widow like her with no one to rely on maintain her life? The whole family often survived only on tree bark and wild grass. In less than two years, two of the three children starved to death. But the evil landlord did not let her go, and a bully even wanted to sell her. In the end, she had to reluctantly leave her child in her mother's home and flee alone from her hometown of Ningbo to Shanghai to work as a servant. In the old society, she suffered all kinds of torments and bullying, which forced her family to be destroyed and lived a life worse than cattle for decades. How could she not hate it? But in the past, she always thought it was bad luck. Recalling all her experiences, she just cried for a while and that was it. After liberation, she received the education of the Party and knew that this was not fate, but the result of exploitation and oppression by class enemies. She is now married, and her husband and son are both workers and live a very happy life. How could she not love the new society and the Communist Party? She often says: "If the counter-revolutionaries are not eradicated, we cannot live a good life."

    无形战线上的女尖兵
    本报记者  胡瑞松
    在上海南市西凌家宅，有一位被群众称为“玻璃眼睛”的普通家庭妇女，从解放以来，她一共检举了一百四十八件反革命分子和坏分子的材料，还亲自协助政府逮捕了六十三名罪犯。她就是上海市出席全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的代表周水月。
    西凌家宅是个棚户区。在反动统治的年代，这里是贫苦劳动人民聚居的地方，也是地痞流氓、恶霸分子横行霸道的地方。解放前夕，不少逃亡地主、“还乡团”等都在这里安家落户。他们在这里赌博、盗窃、吸毒和调戏妇女，把这个地区搞得乌烟瘴气。当时周水月见到这一切也只敢怒而不敢言。解放后，她再也抑制不住心头的怒火，要坚决协助政府惩办这些危害人民的坏蛋。
    周水月有着很高的政治觉悟和革命警惕性，许多狡猾的敌人都没有逃过她的眼睛。
    在几年前一个冬天的夜里，她担任“冬防”巡逻，当走到西凌家宅九十三弄六号陈文高屋旁时，听到里面有两个人在低声交谈，其中一个人恶狠狠地说：“看他还能猖狂到什么时候。……”这句没头没尾的话，立即引起了她的注意。后来又发现陈文高家里住着一个陌生的“小贩”，他一会儿卖五香豆，一会儿又转为卖扇子或儿童玩具；早上很早出去，晚上很晚才回来。这就更引起她的怀疑，为什么这个小贩不专做一样生意？平时又为什么躲躲闪闪，怕见人？她把这些情况及时报告了派出所。据公安机关进一步追查，原来这“小贩”名叫李浩清，过去曾任过伪县党部执行委员、税务局主任、谍报科长等伪职，是一个漏网的反革命分子。这个狡猾的敌人，以做小贩为名，经常出没无常。她为了协助公安部门查明这个“小贩”的行踪，常常通宵不眠，夜以继日地注意他的活动。一天晚上，外面下着倾盆大雨，她想：“这正是反革命分子活动的好机会。”于是，她冒雨走出家门，继续进行侦察。在雨地里一会儿衣服湿透了，冰凉的雨水使她冷得发抖。在一个月以后的一天下午，公安人员根据周水月的报告，终于将这个漏网的反革命分子逮捕了。
    1950年的秋天，西凌家宅二十七弄二十号，住进一个独眼人，这个陌生的“居民”一住下，就引起周水月的怀疑：他没有报户口，又没有职业，白天睡觉，晚上出去“拾破烂”，可是吃得很好，还常赌博。看他的眼睛又好像是枪伤痕迹。根据这些情况，她断定这个人不是好人。一天夜里，她开会回来，快十二点了，路过“独眼”的门口，见里面还有灯火，她就从门缝向里面一看，刚巧看见“独眼”从屋梁上拿下一包东西，打开外面一层层纸，拿出一张长方形的纸条，放在灯光下，和另外两个人一面看一面低声说：“去找关系去”。她在当天晚上，就把这些情况一五一十告诉了派出所。经过公安人员严密侦查，证明这个“独眼龙”名叫孙景良，是由舟山潜入上海进行反革命活动的特务分子，她所见到的那张纸条，就是蒋介石集团给这个特务的“特派令”。
    要逮捕孙景良的时候，该犯突然不见了。这是一个漆黑的风雨之夜，地上积水很深，泥泞不堪。周水月见特务分子跑了，十分气愤。她毫不畏惧地独自一人向二十七弄附近的广场找去，刚走到拐角的地方，见前面竹篱笆旁边有个黑影一闪，她立即大叫：“哪一个？”对方也反问了一句：“你是哪一个？”一听口音，正是特务分子孙景良。她一个箭步，扑上前去。当孙犯知道抓住他的是一个妇女的时候，就威胁她说：“放不放？不放就要你的命！”并狠狠地打她一拳，想乘机逃掉。勇敢的周水月，明明知道自己的气力小，敌不过对方，但她想：“要是让他逃掉，就会使很多人受害，死了我一个周水月，有什么关系呢？”于是，她咬紧牙关，使尽全身的力量，拼命抓住孙犯的衣服不放。孙景良见势不妙，就把周水月揿倒，用双手卡住她的喉部。正在这千钧一发的时候，公安人员闻声赶来，孙犯当即被捕了。这时公安人员从水地上把周水月扶起，紧紧握住她的手，激动地说：“你真是一个了不起的人，你又一次协助我们为民除了一害。”
    几年来，周水月许多检举和协助公安部门破获特务、反革命分子和坏分子的动人事迹，不仅西凌家宅附近居民非常熟悉，而且已在全市人们中间传开了，许多文艺工作者去访问，把她生动的斗争故事写成诗歌，编成剧本，在里弄里、在舞台上向人们演唱。
    什么力量使她这样勇敢坚强，立场鲜明，甚至不惜冒着牺牲个人生命的危险，而不肯放走一个反革命分子呢？这正如她自己所说：是因为恨旧社会，爱共产党。在旧社会，她生长在一个贫农家庭里，父亲因交不起租，活活被地主逼死；母亲无法维持生活，先把她的大姐卖掉，又把周水月送到婆家。她十六岁就结婚了，谁知十九岁那年丈夫被国民党军队抓去当壮丁，被毒打而死。当时她已有三个孩子了。在那个反动统治的黑暗社会里，像她这样无依无靠的青年孀妇，怎么能够维持生活呢？全家往往只靠树皮野草度日。不到两年，三个孩子，活活地饿死了两个。但万恶的地主，还没有放她，有一个恶霸还想把她卖掉，最后她不得不忍痛把孩子留在娘家，一个人由家乡宁波逃到上海，给人家当佣人。在旧社会她受尽了种种折磨和欺凌，逼得家破人亡，过了几十年牛马不如的生活，怎么能使她不恨呢？可是过去总认为这是命苦，回忆起一切遭遇，只是痛哭一阵就算了。解放后受到党的教育，知道这不是命，而是阶级敌人剥削和压迫的结果。她已结了婚，她的丈夫和儿子都是工人，生活很幸福，这又使她怎么能不热爱新社会，不热爱共产党呢？她常说：“反革命分子不肃清，就不能过好日子。”（附图片）
