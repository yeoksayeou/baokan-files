Everyone Should See "Lessons of History"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xiao San
    The film "Lessons of History," jointly produced by the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, tells the story of the great leader of the Bulgarian people and outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement, Dimitrov, fighting against the fascists during his revolutionary activities in Germany.
    In 1933, after Hitler came to power, he fabricated the Reichstag fire and unreasonably arrested Dimitrov. Dimitrov exposed the fascist conspiracy in the Leipzig trial, defended the honor of the Communist Party member, and set a brilliant example for proletarian revolutionary fighters all over the world. There is a famous saying in our country: "Reviewing the old helps one to understand the new"; everyone should see "Lessons of History." A great struggle took place in Berlin. Hitler came to power, stormtroopers took to the field, opposing the Communist Party, conspiracies were endless: setting fire to the Reichstag, the murderer hid party documents; arresting Thalmann, killing countless people, attempting to wipe out the masses and leaders in one fell swoop! Dimitrov dedicated his life to the revolution. He was the most upright man, calm and wise. He was falsely accused of arson, and a trial was held. Dimitrov's words were stern and righteous, his reason was firm and his spirit was strong, and his integrity was unwavering, thus making the defendant the plaintiff. He frightened the examining magistrate, infuriated fat Goering, making the nature of fascism clear to the world. I was fortunate enough to meet this man in Moscow; at an evening party, he came to meet the writers. He gave a short speech, incisive and passionate. The audience applauded loudly, shaking the building! Communist poets from various countries: Louis Aragon, recited in a loud voice; I also offered a clumsy verse: "Ode to the Communist International," comparing Dimitrov to the helmsman. After each person finished reading their poem, they approached him to pay their respects, everyone shook his hand, and the warmth of his hand showed his enthusiasm. A hurried ten years passed, and I came to Moscow again, for the All-Union Culture Festival, commemorating Pushkin. Unexpectedly, on a midsummer evening, I was shocked by the fall of a great star! The great revolutionary passed away peacefully. In the Trade Union Building, in a dim columned hall, thousands of laborers mourned and paid their respects to his remains, a final farewell, filled with sorrow and tears. I came to Sofia and visited his white tomb twice, the great leader, peaceful as in life. I stood for a moment with my hat off, solemnly respectful, as if hearing the eloquent words of Leipzig, as if seeing his cordial and graceful demeanor in Moscow. The pride of the people, may this man live forever! After liberation, I visited Berlin twice. Ruins and rubble, countless shell marks; the remains of the Reichstag, shocking to the eye. The fascist bandits, playing with fire, eventually burned themselves! Who knew that twenty years later, they still would not be at peace, the United States, Britain, and France, forcibly occupying West Berlin, Hitler's remnants, seething with murderous intent. I once stood on Unter den Linden, observing the great divide just a few steps away. The new Soviet proposal is welcomed by the whole world! Get out quickly and establish a free city. Never forget: the lessons of history!
    Note: "Unter den Linden" is Unter den Linden Street, one end of the street is the dividing line between East and West Berlin. (Attached picture)

    大家应该看“历史的教训”
    萧三
    苏联和保加利亚联合摄制的影片“历史的教训”，记述了保加利亚人民的伟大领袖、国际工人运动的卓越战士季米特洛夫，在德国进行革命活动时期，同法西斯作斗争的故事。
    1933年，希特勒上台后，制造了国会纵火案，无理逮捕了季米特洛夫。季米特洛夫在莱比锡法庭上揭穿了法西斯的阴谋，捍卫了共产党员的荣誉，给全世界无产阶级革命战士树立了光辉的榜样。我国有名言：“温故而知新”；大家应该看：“历史的教训”。一场大斗争，发生在柏林。希特勒登台，冲锋队上阵，反对共产党，阴谋无穷尽：放火烧国会，凶手藏党证；逮捕台尔曼，打杀无数人，群众和领袖，一网图打尽！季米特洛夫，一生为革命。为人最正直，沉着亦英明。栽诬他纵火，开堂来公审。季米特洛夫，辞严又义正，理直而气壮，节义示坚贞，遂使被告者，成为原告人。吓坏预审官，气死胖戈林，法西斯何物，举世全分明。我在莫斯科，有幸会斯人；一个晚会上，来会作家们。简短作讲演，精辟具热忱。会场大鼓掌，屋宇为所震！来自各国家，共产党诗人：路易·阿拉贡，朗诵闻高声；我亦献拙句：“共产国际吟”，季米特洛夫，比作掌舵人。每人读诗毕，趋向他致敬，人人与握手，手温见热情。匆匆十年整，我又到莫京，全苏文化节，纪念普式庚。讵料仲夏夕，惊叹巨星陨！伟大革命者，寿终得正寝。工会大厦里，惨淡圆柱厅，千万劳动者，凭吊瞻遗容，从此成永诀，悲伤泪涔涔。我来索菲亚，两次谒白陵，伟大的领袖，宁静若生平。脱帽立片刻，肃然而起敬，似闻莱比锡，慷慨陈词声，如在莫斯科，亲切见雍容。人民之骄子，斯人其永生！我在解放后，两度访柏林。颓垣与残壁，累累炮弹痕；国会余残骸，触目又惊心。法西斯匪徒，玩火终自焚！岂知廿年后，仍不得安宁，美英法三国，强占西柏林，希特勒余孽，杀气直腾腾。我曾站立在，翁特德林登，注相隔几步远，天壤太分明。苏联新建议，全世界欢迎！赶快滚出去，设立自由城。切切莫忘记：历史的教训！
    注：“翁特德林登”即菩提树下大街，街的一端，即东西柏林分界处。（附图片）
    这是电影“历史的教训”里的一个镜头
