Shanghai Factories Implement the Mass Line in Running Schools
Opening a Path for the Intellectualization of Workers

    (Our dispatch) Shanghai has deeply mobilized the masses and thoroughly implemented the mass line in its vigorous effort to promote workers' spare-time education. In the past three months, not only have schools been established in most factories throughout the city, and the issue of teachers basically resolved, but many factories have also compiled their own teaching materials. A mass upsurge of running schools has emerged, characterized by a hundred flowers blooming, with everyone thinking of ways and taking action in terms of curriculum, teaching content, and teaching methods.

    This large-scale mass movement was launched under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In August of this year, when Shanghai factories began to vigorously establish new types of spare-time schools, the Municipal Committee promptly held a 10,000-person conference on cultural revolution, explaining in detail to factories throughout the city the educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and analyzed the struggle between two ideologies and two methods in running schools. It called on all factories to conduct extensive airing of views and debates, and, in light of the actual production situation and the workers' demands, to establish schools suitable for production needs and the needs of the masses. The State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, Shanghai Tool Factory, Tongren Alloy Factory, and other factories, which were the first to establish new types of spare-time specialized schools, became models for factory-run schools at that time. Most factories launched discussions on "why run schools" and "whether to run schools," clarifying the purpose and significance of factory-run schools, especially the relationship between cultural revolution and technical revolution. Conservative ideas that unilaterally emphasized production tension and neglected cultural revolution, as well as past educational ideas that were divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality, were criticized. The old system that required seventeen or eighteen years of study to reach the university level was broken through, liberating the workers' thinking and greatly increasing their enthusiasm for running schools. As a result, the city's new types of spare-time schools developed rapidly, and to date, more than 2,300 spare-time middle schools, secondary vocational schools, and higher vocational schools have been established.

    The old system that was divorced from reality has been broken through by the masses, and how to implement the policy of serving production in the new schools in terms of teachers, teaching materials, and teaching methods has triggered a series of reforms. The Municipal Committee has adopted various methods, such as holding on-site meetings to promote mutual visits and learning among factories, and promoting the holding of thematic exhibitions in various regions, to exchange and promote the experiences of running schools in a more, faster, better, and more economical way among the masses, eliminating the old "regularization" thinking of some people who thought that running schools required tall buildings and foreign houses, and the wholesale adoption of the curriculum and textbooks of ordinary universities and middle schools.

    At present, in the process of everyone thinking of ways and offering ideas, the workers have created many experiences in running schools. Various types of factories, according to their factory size, the nature of production, and the level of the students, have established three types of schools: spare-time middle schools, secondary vocational schools, and higher vocational schools. Some of these schools are run independently by one factory, some are run jointly by several factories, and some are jointly run by one industry or one region. The school system of each school is also different. Some factories have established a complete system of spare-time middle schools, while others have implemented a complete system of spare-time middle schools and intermediate and advanced specialized schools, and still others have adopted several methods simultaneously. For example, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, the young workers have more to learn, so they study for five years after graduating from junior high school to reach the university graduation level; senior workers above Grade 6 who have a primary school education can specialize in a technical course, so they can reach the university graduation level in three years. In Yulin District, there are more than 160 spare-time schools for workers and staff, with fifty or sixty different approaches. The length of study is entirely left to the factory leaders and the masses to discuss and decide according to the actual situation, without any rigid regulations. The general situation now is that it takes about six to eight years from beginning to eliminate illiteracy to being trained to the university graduation level.

    In just two or three months, more than 2,000 schools have been established in factories throughout the city, and it is not easy to equip a teaching staff, especially teachers of technical courses. Due to the implementation of the principle of "the capable are teachers, use local materials," on the one hand, short-term training classes were adopted to train and transform the full-time teachers of the original spare-time schools, and they were regularly organized to go down to the factories and workshops to conduct labor training and collect teaching materials. On the other hand, a large number of workers who are good at something, especially old workers with relatively rich experience in production and political struggle, were developed as teachers, and they lectured alone or in cooperation with technical personnel, so that the problem of teachers was solved. When the Shanghai Automobile Transportation Fourth Yard ran a school, they initially believed in professors and technicians. But after a few days of classes, the workers found it difficult to understand what the technicians were talking about. Later, it was decided to look for teachers among the workers. After mass recommendation, nine old workers were introduced, which not only solved the problem of teachers for technical courses in this school, but also the students unanimously said that they were satisfied with what they heard. The Huaxing Electroplating Factory also implemented the so-called "the eldest teaches the second, the second teaches the third" method. Old workers acted as teachers, and apprentices also acted as little teachers, truly achieving "everyone is a teacher, everyone is a student."

    Regarding an important link in teaching – teaching materials – how to adapt them to serve the politics of the proletariat and production, a wave of enthusiasm for revising and compiling teaching materials has been set off in various factories. Initially, most of them were based on the opinions of the workers and masses to carry out "cutting, supplementing, replacing, and combining," but they still could not fully meet the needs of the factories. Further development involved workers compiling their own teaching materials, or technical personnel and cultural teachers compiling them together with old workers. The "Factory Teaching" and "Chemical Outline" and other teaching materials that have been compiled by the Xinguang Underwear Factory and the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory were all collectively compiled from the actual production of the factory workshop. According to incomplete statistics, more than 100 sets of teaching materials have been compiled by the masses themselves.

    In terms of teaching methods, the teachers of some schools have developed from collective lesson preparation to teachers and students preparing lessons together, or going deep into the workshop before preparing lessons to collect materials and solicit opinions from the workers (i.e., students). The creative teaching method of using literary and artistic forms to teach lessons at the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill has been warmly welcomed by the students, and now the students have also participated in giving lectures.

### 上海工厂贯彻群众路线大办学校  为工人知识化开辟了道路

    上海工厂贯彻群众路线大办学校
    为工人知识化开辟了道路
    本报讯  上海在大办职工业余教育工作中，相当深入地发动群众，贯彻执行了群众路线。三个多月来，不仅已经在全市多数工厂中办了学校，基本解决了师资问题，很多工厂还自编了教材；在学制、课程、教学内容和教学方法等方面也都出现了百花齐放，人人想办法、人人动手的群众性办学热潮。
    这个声势浩大的群众运动是在中共上海市委领导下展开的。今年8月，上海工厂开始大办新型业余学校的时候，市委及时地举行了文化革命万人大会，向全市工厂详细地阐明了教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动结合的办学方针，分析了办学中的两种思想、两种方法的斗争。号召各工厂大鸣大放，结合本单位生产实际和工人的要求，创办适合生产需要和群众需要的学校。全市最早创办新型业余专科学校的国棉十七厂、上海工具厂、铜仁合金厂等当时成了工厂办学的榜样。大部分工厂都展开了“为什么办学”和“要不要办学”的讨论，认识清楚了工厂办学的目的和意义，尤其是文化革命与技术革命的关系。对于片面强调生产紧张，忽视文化革命的保守思想，以及过去脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的办学思想，进行了批判。把过去一套需要十七、八年才能读到大学程度的课程学制突破了，解放了工人们的思想，办学积极性大为增长。于是全市新型的业余学校便一日千里地发展起来，至今已办了业余中学、中专、高专二千三百多所。
    过去一套脱离实际的学制已被群众冲破，新的学校的师资、教材、教学方法等如何贯彻为生产服务的方针，引起了一系列的改革。市委就采取召开现场会议，推动各厂相互参观学习，促进各地区举办专题展览会等各种方式，交流推广群众中多快好省的办学经验，扫除了有些人办学校就要高楼洋房，课程教材照搬普通大中学校的一套旧型“正规化”思想。
    目前，各工厂在人人想办法、个个出主意中，工人群众已创造了许多办学经验。各种类型的工厂，根据它们厂型的大小，生产的性质和学员的水平，举办了业余中学、中专、高专三种类型的学校，这些学校有的一个厂独办，有的几个厂合办，有的由一种行业或一个地区联合举办。各种学校的学制也不相同。有的工厂设立中小学一贯制的业余中学，有的则实行了业余中学与中级、高级专科学校一贯制，还有同时采取几种办法的。像上海机床厂，青年工人该学的东西多些，初中毕业后读五年达到大学毕业水平；六级工以上、具有高小毕业程度的老工人，在技术课程上可以专学一门，因此三年就可达到大学毕业水平。榆林区有一百六十多所职工业余学校，就有五、六十种做法。学习年限全都放手让各工厂领导与群众根据实际情形商量决定，不作硬性规定。现在的一般情况，从脱盲开始，培养到大学毕业水平，大都在六到八年左右。
    在短短两三个月中全市工厂办的学校已有两千多所，配备师资队伍，特别是技术课教师是不容易解决的。由于贯彻了“能者为师、就地取材”的原则，一方面采取短训班，训练、改造原有业余学校的专职教师，并且定期组织他们下厂下车间进行劳动锻炼，收集教学资料。另一方面大量发展有所擅长的工人，特别是生产和政治斗争经验比较丰富的老工人当教师，由他们单独或者同技术人员合作讲课，这样师资问题就得到了解决。上海市汽车运输四场办学时，起初就迷信教授和技术人员。可是上了几天课，技术人员讲的一套，工人反而不易领会。后来决定在工人中物色。经过群众推荐，推出了九个老工人，不仅解决了这个学校技术课的师资问题，而且学生一致都说听得满意。华兴电镀厂还实行了所谓“老大教老二，老二教老三”的办法。老工人当教师，艺徒也当小先生，真正做到了“人人是老师，人人是学生。”
    对于教学工作中的重要一环——教材，如何适应为无产阶级的政治、为生产服务，各工厂普遍掀起了从修改教材到编写教材的热潮。最初大部分是根据工人群众的意见，进行“砍、补、换、合”，但是还不能完全适合工厂的需要，进一步发展到由工人自编教材，或技术人员、文化教师同老工人合编。新光内衣厂、上海机床厂已编出的“工厂教学”、“化学提纲”等教材，都是从本厂车间生产实际集体编写出来的。据不完全统计，群众自编的整套教材，已有一百多种。
    在教学方法上，有些学校的教师已从集体备课发展到师生一起备课，或者备课前深入车间，向工人（即学生）收集材料和征求意见。国棉十七厂用文艺形式教课的创造性教学方法，受到了学员的热烈欢迎，现在学员们也参加进来讲课了。
