    Extinguishing the Arrogance of the Paper Tiger
    It's been quite a while since I saw "The Paper Tiger's Exposure," but the images of those outwardly strong but inwardly weak and utterly disgraceful imperialist reactionaries still remain in my mind. The performance of this play was welcomed by the audience.
    The playwright mercilessly exposed the hideous faces of the imperialist warmongers using comedic forms. The technique is cartoonish, but I feel there's truth in the exaggeration, analysis in the commotion, and the audience can gain some inspiration from the laughter, arousing a strong hatred and contempt for the enemy.
    I think the reason why this play won the audience's welcome mainly lies in its strong and clear political theme. The playwright and director have both explained this. Author Chen Baichen said: "When I wrote this script in August, my initial intention was to write about how American imperialism, this paper tiger, showed its true colors through the success of the Iraqi revolution and the Arab people's struggle against imperialism. But after writing two acts, the U.S. imperialists started a fire in the Taiwan Strait area. Since it wants to clash with the great Chinese people, how could I suppress this incomparable anger and not bring its image of being beaten to a bloody pulp before the Chinese people onto the stage?" Director Jin Shan said: "We must not be soft on the imperialists... we must see through them thoroughly and strike them hard... so that they know what's what. We must peel off the tiger skin paper stuck on them layer by layer, exposing their true colors. Let everyone see it thoroughly—this is my directorial concept, and all our stage arrangements are like this."
    From the performance's effect, the author's and director's intentions have been achieved. Currently, there are not many dramas that quickly reflect the current international political struggle. I think we need this kind of combative satirical drama. Of course, we can also demand that they have a higher ideological content, reduce some of the commotion, and add more thought-provoking elements. (Liu Gan)

    灭纸老虎的威风
    看过“纸老虎现形记”已经好久了，但是那些外强中干、丑态毕露的帝国主义反动派的形象，还一直留在我的脑子里。这戏的演出，受到了观众的欢迎。
    剧作者运用喜剧形式无情地揭露了帝国主义战争狂人们的狰狞面目，手法是漫画式的，可是我觉得夸张中有真实，喧闹中有分析，观众在哄笑中能有所启发，引起了观众对敌人的强烈的憎恶和蔑视。
    我觉得这戏之所以赢得观众的欢迎，主要在它的强烈的鲜明的政治主题上。关于这点，剧作者和导演都有过说明。作者陈白尘说：“当8月中我写这个剧本时，初意是想通过伊拉克革命的成功和阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义的斗争，写出美帝国主义这只纸老虎怎样露出原形的。但写成两幕，美帝又在台湾海峡地区放火了。它既想碰一碰伟大的中国人民，那我怎么能按下这无比的愤怒，不把它在中国人民面前碰得头破血流的形象搬上舞台呢？”导演金山说：“我们对于帝国主义者，决不能手下留情……一定要看得透打得狠……才能使他们知道厉害。我们一定要把粘在它们身上的虎皮纸层层剥尽，剥得它原形毕露。让大家看个淋漓尽致——这就是我的导演构思，我们舞台上的一切安排也就是这样。”
    从演出的效果来看，作者和导演的意图是达到了的。目前迅速反映当前国际政治斗争的戏剧还不多，我觉得我们需要这一类战斗性的讽刺剧，当然我们还可以要求它们具有更高的思想性，减少一些喧闹，增加一些更多发人深思的东西。  （刘敢）
