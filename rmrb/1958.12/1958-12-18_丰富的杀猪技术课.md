    Rich Pig Slaughtering Technology Course
    Slaughtering pigs is both easy and difficult: catching them, they run; killing them, they squeal. To slaughter a pig well, one needs a bit of skill and knowledge. However, no school has ever been heard of offering a pig slaughtering technology course. Now, the Shanghai Meat United Processing Factory's meat processing amateur secondary technical school, in order to cultivate and improve workers' slaughtering and processing skills, has established a pig slaughtering technology course. But to offer such a course, there were no teaching materials and no teachers could be hired. The school decided to invite several of the most experienced veteran workers in the workshop to teach the course, and first asked the veteran workers to prepare the lessons together. In one lesson preparation session, the veteran workers talked endlessly about their experiences, not only statistically analyzing the breeds of live pigs, but also detailing the personalities and temperaments of various live pigs, such as the sandy pig being weak and reluctant to move, the Huai pig being physically strong, running fast, and having a violent temperament, etc.; they also provided very good experience on how to catch pigs. In addition, they also organized a set of slaughtering and processing production processes and methods, from live pig maintenance, electric stunning, bleeding, to scraping the hair off the white meat, and summarized the technical measures for each process. The school's full-time teachers organized the experiences they talked about, printed them into handouts, and wrote eight chapters. Among them, technical revolution, the use of mechanical operation methods and other parts, will be written into new chapters later.
    Currently, there are teaching materials for the pig slaughtering technology course. In the future, the classroom will be moved to the workshop, and students can listen to lectures, read textbooks, and perform actual operations at the same time, making it even more rich and colorful.

    丰富的杀猪技术课
    杀猪，又容易又不容易：捉它，它会跑；杀它，它会叫。要杀好一头猪，也要有点技术，有点学问才行。但是，过去还没有听说过哪一所学校开过杀猪技术课。现在，上海肉类联合加工厂举办的肉类加工业余中等专科学校，为了培养和提高工人们屠宰加工技术，已设置了杀猪技术课。可是要开这样的课，既找不到教材，也聘请不到教员。学校就决定请车间里几个最有经验的老工人去教课，并先请老工人们一起备课。在一次备课中，老工人们滔滔不绝地谈了许多经验，不仅统计了生猪的品种，而且还详细地分析了各种生猪的性格脾气，沙猪懦弱不爱动，淮猪体力强，跑得快，性格暴躁等等；对怎样捉猪的方法，也提供了很好的经验。此外，他们还整理了一套屠宰加工的生产过程和方法，从生猪保养，麻电，放血，直到把毛刮尽的白肉为止，每项过程的技术措施都作了小结。学校的专职教师把他们所谈的经验整理一下，印成讲义，就写了八个章节。其中技术革命，用机械操作的方法等部分，以后还将写成新的章节。
    目前，上杀猪技术课，已有了教材。以后课堂将搬到车间去，学员可以一面听讲，一面读教材，一面实际操作，更其丰富多彩。
