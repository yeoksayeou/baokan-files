Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 17th: Reporter Zhu Shi and Wang Huandou report: Zhao Du People's Commune in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, implements tiered management of the commune, cultivation zone, and production team, appropriately delegating the authority of production, finance, and labor management to the cultivation zone and production team, giving play to the initiative of cadres at all levels of the commune and the broad masses of commune members, further consolidating the commune, and greatly changing the face of production.

　　Zhao Du Commune was established in early October this year. The entire commune has two thousand seven hundred and fifty-five households, twelve thousand six hundred and sixty-one people, and is divided into four cultivation zones and twenty-four production teams. After the establishment of the commune, although more than a thousand laborers were successively transferred to support iron and steel production, it still completed a much larger autumn harvest task and various other tasks than last year, greatly demonstrating the superiority of the commune. However, because the commune had not had time to keep up with various management systems during the tense production activities, there were also some problems. The main problems were: After the commune unified the management of the entire commune's production and the lives of its members, the commune's leading cadres were busy dealing with trivial daily affairs all day long, unable to concentrate on carefully studying the overall policies and guidelines of the commune and going deep into the grassroots to solve important problems. On the other hand, the cadres below were also unaware of the details of the commune's affairs, always thinking that the commune's affairs were larger than in the past, and that they could spend money casually, complaining that the commune was too strict. Some commune members showed a lack of care for public property. In addition, in terms of labor allocation, due to the implementation of large-scale corps operations with the cultivation zone as the unit, the production team did not have the power to mobilize labor, and many sporadic tasks were not arranged, resulting in idle waste where some people had nothing to do and some things had no one to do.

　　The Party General Branch Committee and the Commune Management Committee studied the above situation and believed that an important reason for the occurrence of these problems was that the commune was managing too much, which affected the initiative of the lower levels. To change this situation and adapt to the new situation of a greater leap forward next year, it is necessary to implement a tiered management method of the commune, cultivation zone, and production team under unified leadership to implement democratic management and give play to the initiative of all cadres and members of the commune.

　　The commune first held a series of meetings among cadres and members, launching a great airing of views, great debates, and great discussions aimed at the above problems, and carried out ideological education in socialism and communism. On the basis of raising the ideological awareness of the masses, the commune concentrated the opinions of the masses, formulated a plan for tiered management, and used the third cultivation zone as a pilot project, and after gaining experience, promoted it throughout the commune.

　　The commune put forward three principles for implementing tiered management: First, the cultivation zone must first ensure the completion of the commune's various tasks and obey the commune's unified command and mobilization. Second, delineate the scope of functions and powers of the commune, cultivation zone, and production team. Third, income belongs to the commune, and unified distribution is implemented, and spiritual and material rewards are given to the cultivation zones, production teams, and members who have completed their tasks well, graded and classified.

　　Under the guarantee of these three principles, in terms of agricultural production, the commune issued overall requirements to each cultivation zone based on the state plan and the living needs of the members. Cultivation zones can develop various agricultural and sideline production that the commune has not planned but is needed by society, according to local conditions and the aptitudes of the people. Production materials are also distributed to the cultivation zones for unified allocation and use, and general medium and small-sized production tools are distributed to the production teams as much as possible for responsible management. In terms of industrial production, those with large investments, requiring a lot of labor, and that cannot be handled by one cultivation zone are directly managed by the commune, and those that can be handled by each cultivation zone are managed by the cultivation zone. In terms of sideline production, hogs and other livestock and poultry are managed by each cultivation zone.

　　Secondly, implement financial decentralization. The Commune Committee allocates various financial and economic tasks assigned by the state to each cultivation zone, and each cultivation zone must ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by the commune; the Commune Committee uniformly formulates food standards and the authority to spend production and administrative management expenses, etc. Each cultivation zone formulates a revenue and expenditure plan in accordance with the standards stipulated by the commune, based on careful calculation, tapping potential, living within its means, and being conducive to production. The commune manages according to the plan, and the unit and personnel responsible for failing to implement the plan or compiling the plan irregularly, resulting in losses, are responsible. The financial revenue and expenditure plan of each cultivation zone must be strictly implemented after being approved by the Commune Committee. Expenditures within the plan can be flexibly controlled and used by the cultivation zone due to special changes, but must not exceed the budget; all overruns must be added to the plan and approved. All income outside the plan must be reported to the commune, and the Commune Management Committee will award a percentage of the income depending on the situation. Vegetables produced by the vegetable base of each canteen can be sold if they are not eaten, and the canteen can use the income to add cooking utensils and improve the lives of its members.

　　Finally, in terms of labor allocation, the power to mobilize is concentrated in the cultivation zone during the busy farming season in order to facilitate the organization of forces to carry out shock work; however, the production team has the power to arrange farm work according to local conditions and the aptitudes of the people in order to improve work efficiency and avoid idle work. At ordinary times, labor allocation is mainly based on professional teams, with fixed personnel contracting for specific tasks.

　　After the commune implemented the tiered management system, many new atmospheres appeared. The commune leadership got rid of the passive situation, and the leadership became more proactive. After getting rid of trivial affairs, the secretary of the Party General Branch can fully consider and study how the entire commune can organize forces, funds, seeds, and fertilizers to realize the planning of diversified economy, and how to make the members live well, and can go down to inspect at any time, discover problems and solve them. The initiative and enthusiasm of each cultivation zone and production team have greatly increased. The production teams in the third cultivation zone immediately launched a heat wave of mutual competition, accelerating the progress of digging sweet potatoes. The feeders in each cultivation zone guarantee to fatten up nine hundred pigs before the Spring Festival, and in addition to completing the state's upward transfer task, each person can eat about two pounds of cured meat. The first, second, and fourth cultivation zones have all found some sideline businesses that do not require much labor, adapting to local conditions and the aptitudes of the people without affecting the commune's unified arrangement of production tasks, opening up sources of income, and striving to increase income. At the same time, each cultivation zone and production team can carefully calculate their expenditures, living within their means, and saving expenses. In early December, the average daily expenditure of the entire commune was reduced by more than half compared with the average daily expenditure of the entire commune in November. In addition, it also improved the relationship between top and bottom, left and right, and enhanced unity.

    分级分权  民主管理
    领导主动  区队积极
    赵渡公社明确划分社、耕作区、生产队职权，促进了生产发展
    新华社成都17日电  记者朱实、王焕斗报道：四川金堂县赵渡人民公社实行社、耕作区、生产队分级管理，把生产、财务和劳动管理的权限适当下放到耕作区和生产队，发挥了公社各级干部和广大社员的积极性，使公社进一步巩固，生产面貌大大改观。
    赵渡公社是今年10月初成立的。全社有二千七百五十五户，一万二千六百六十一人，共划分四个耕作区，二十四个生产队。公社成立以后，虽然陆续抽调了一千多个劳动力支援钢铁等生产，仍然完成了比去年大得多的四秋突击任务和各项工作，大大显示了公社的优越性。但是由于公社在紧张的生产活动中，各项管理制度还没有来得及跟上去，因而也存在着一些问题。主要问题是：公社统一管理全社生产和社员生活以后，社的领导干部成天忙于处理繁琐的日常事务，不能集中精力认真研究全社性的大政方针和深入下层解决重要问题。另一方面，下面干部对公社的家务也摸不着底，总认为公社家务比过去大了，可以随便开支，怪公社卡的太紧。部分社员中出现了不爱护公共财物的现象。此外，在劳动力调配上，由于实行了以耕作区为单位的大兵团作战，生产队没有调动劳动力的权力，许多零星活路没人安排，出现了有人无事作，有事无人作的窝工浪费现象。
    公社党总支委员会和社务管理委员会研究了上述情况，认为这些问题的发生，其中一个重要原因是公社管得太多，影响了下面的积极性。要改变这种情况，适应明年更大跃进的新形势，必须实行统一领导下公社、耕作区、生产队分级管理的办法，来贯彻管理民主化，发挥全社干部和社员的积极性。
    公社首先在干部和社员中召开一系列会议，针对上述问题展开大鸣大放大辩论，进行了社会主义和共产主义的思想教育。在群众思想觉悟提高的基础上，公社集中了群众的意见，制定了分级管理的方案，并以第三耕作区为试点，取得经验后，向全社推广。
    公社提出了实行分级管理的三条原则：一、耕作区要首先保证完成公社的各项任务和服从公社的统一指挥和调动。二、划分公社、耕作区、生产队的职权范围。三、收入归公社，实行统一分配，对完成任务较好的耕作区、生产队和社员，分等分级给以精神奖励和物质奖励。
    在这三项原则的保证下，在农业生产方面，公社根据国家计划和社员的生活需要，将总的要求下达给各耕作区。耕作区可以因人因地制宜的发展公社没有计划到而为社会需要的各种农副业生产。生产资料也分给耕作区统一调拨使用，一般中小型生产工具等都尽可能分给生产队负责管理。在工业生产方面，凡投资大，需要劳力多，非一个耕作区所能办的，由公社直接掌管，凡各耕作区能办的由耕作区负责经营。在副业生产方面，毛猪及其他家畜、家禽都由各耕作区负责经营。
    其次，实行财务下放。社委会根据国家分配的各项财经任务分配给各耕作区，各耕作区必须保证完成公社所分配的任务；社委会统一制定伙食标准和生产、行政管理费用等开支权限，各耕作区按社所规定标准，本着精打细算、挖掘潜力、量入为出和有利生产的原则编造收支计划，社按计划管理，对不执行计划，不定期编制计划以致造成损失的，由失职单位及人员负责，各耕作区的财务收支计划经社委会审批后，必须严格执行，计划以内开支因特殊变化，耕作区有权灵活掌握使用，但不得超支；凡超支都要追加计划，经过批准。凡计划以外的收入，必须报缴公社，由公社管委会视情况提成奖励。各食堂蔬菜基地出产的蔬菜，如食用不完，可以出售，这笔收入，食堂可以用来添置炊事用具和改善社员生活。
    最后，在劳动调配方面，农忙时，调动权力集中在耕作区，以便于组织力量进行突击；但生产队有权因人因地安排农活，以便提高工效和避免窝工。平时，劳力调配则以专业队为主，固定人员分工包干。
    公社在实行了分级管理制度以后，出现了许多新的气象。公社领导摆脱了被动局面，领导更加主动了。党总支书记摆脱了琐碎事务后，对全公社如何组织力量、资金、种籽、肥料，实现多种经济的规划，如何使社员过好生活，已能进行充分的考虑和研究，并能随时下去检查，发现问题和解决问题。各耕作区和生产队工作主动性和积极性都大大增加。第三耕作区各生产队立刻掀起了互相竞赛的热潮，加快了挖红苕的进度。各耕作区的饲养员保证在春节前喂肥九百头猪，除了完成国家上调任务以外，每人约可吃到两斤腊肉。第一、第二、第四耕作区都找到了一些用人不多的副业门路，在不影响公社统一安排生产任务的情况下，因地制宜，因人制宜，开辟财源，努力增加收入。同时，各耕作区和生产队在开支上也都能精打细算，量入为出，节约支出。12月上旬全社平均每天各项开支比11月份全社每天平均支出减低了一半以上。此外，还改善了上下左右的关系，增强了团结。
