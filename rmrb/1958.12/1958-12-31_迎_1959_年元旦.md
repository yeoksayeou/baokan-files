    Welcoming the New Year of 1959
    Huang Yanpei

    A radiant and splendid New China! This is another joyful New Year's Day. Culture and technology are constantly innovating, and workers and peasants are leaping forward in production. Looking westward, the capitalist countries are being abandoned and isolated, one after another "rotting"! Rotting away! Embarrassing like a "yam egg," crises come one after another, everyone recognizes them as paper tigers. This year, watch! Watch how they overcome all sorts of difficulties. Taking steel as the key link, steel refines people, and people refine steel. The human and material resources of New China are constantly being strengthened. In 1958, the output of 10.7 million tons was completed ahead of schedule, and the new target of 18 million tons will undoubtedly soon satisfy people's expectations. Speaking of people's communes, many people beam with joy. What people are most happy to hear is: eating doesn't cost money anymore. Look! Illiteracy has been eliminated, and poems are all over the walls. The people of Xushui wrote: "In the past, believing in gods made us starve, now believing in the Party fills our granaries." Forward! Forward! Advance together from self-reform! Intellectuals! Industrialists and businessmen! Day by day new! And again new! Build a happy and prosperous future through peaceful means. Under the correct and wise leadership of the Party, we have embarked on a bright and splendid future. There are endless new things, and nature is at our command. It is the light of the whole world, the early spring of all mankind.

    迎1959年元旦
    黄炎培新中国一片光辉灿烂！这是又一个欢天喜地的元旦。文化、技术不断地在革新，工农大跃进生产。抬头西望，资本主义国家众叛亲离，一个接着一个在“烂”！烂下去！献丑像“山药旦”，危机又来“后院”，大家识得它是纸老虎了，这一年，看！看它怎样度过种种难关。以钢为纲，钢炼人，人炼钢，新中国人力物力都在不断地加
  强。1958年，早提前完成了一千零七十万吨
  的产量，一千八百万吨的新的指标，无疑地将很快满足人们期望。一说到人民公社，许多人笑逐颜开。人们最喜闻乐道的是：吃饭不要钱了。看呀！扫清了文盲，到处诗歌满墙，徐水的人民这样写着：“过去信神饿断肠，如今信党谷满仓”。前进！前进！从自我改造中一
  齐前进！知识分子们！工商业者们！日日新！又日新！通过和平道路，建成幸福繁荣。在党的正确而英明的领导下，走上了光明灿烂的前程。说不尽的新鲜事物，大自然都在听候命令。是全世界的光明，是全人类的初春。
