Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: The National Representative Meeting of Women Activists in Socialist Construction solemnly opened in Beijing this afternoon.

Peng Dehuai, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Huang Kecheng, secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, attended today's meeting. Peng Dehuai delivered a speech at the meeting on behalf of the CPC Central Committee. (Full text of the speech will be issued separately)

The venue of today's meeting was filled with more than 2,500 women activists from 28 provinces (autonomous regions) and cities across the country, as well as from organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, central state organs, and the armed forces. They represent 39 different ethnic groups, including an 84-year-old woman and a 12-year-old girl. Under the leadership of the Party, they have all been selected to participate in this meeting because they have worked alongside the broad masses of women and the people of the whole country, making outstanding achievements in various production and work posts.

On a purple velvet screen at the entrance of the venue are written several golden characters: "Raise awareness, learn skills well, and bravely advance for socialist construction!" This slogan marks the general spirit of this meeting and the current combat tasks of women across the country.

"Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," this huge slogan marking the Party's general line is also conspicuously displayed in the venue.

A portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong is hung on the rostrum, flanked by twelve red flags. Palm trees and flowers decorate the rostrum beautifully and solemnly.

Seated on the rostrum are 101 members of the presidium of this meeting. In addition to the leaders of the All-China Women's Federation and some provincial (autonomous region) and municipal women's federations, they also include advanced figures and representatives from all fronts. Among them are Zhang Qiuxiang, the first female agricultural scientist in New China, Shen Jilan, a famous agricultural labor model, Yi Shijuan, a famous textile industry labor model, Qiu San'e, the "steel girl," Wei Fengying, a mechanical worker who completed five years of tasks in four months by improving work processes, Nabuqi, the head of a pastoral production cooperative on the Inner Mongolian grasslands, Cao Yixiu, a Dai ethnic group rat-catching expert, Shu Xiuwen, a famous actress, Li Huizhen, a model female teacher, Chen Qimei, an excellent canteen cook, Lan Yuzhen, a representative from the Beijing Women's Store, and Xu Dama, a model martyr's family member, and others.

Today's meeting began at 2:30 PM. After the band played the national anthem, Li Dequan, vice-chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, delivered the opening speech.

Li Dequan said that this meeting is a gathering of outstanding female soldiers from all fronts of socialist construction, a review of the great achievements of women across the country in the Great Leap Forward, and a rally for women to promote a greater leap forward in socialist construction.

She said that this meeting is being held in the new situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our country. In the all-round Great Leap Forward, the communist consciousness of women in our country has greatly improved. The number of people participating in social labor has greatly increased, the scope of labor has expanded unprecedentedly, and they have made significant contributions to industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings.

Li Dequan emphasized that, in order to adapt to the needs of production and people's lives, rural people's communes and many cities have established a large number of collective living and welfare facilities, which are transforming scattered household chores into social collective undertakings. In this way, many women can concentrate more energy on labor production and learning, and can more fully exert women's wisdom and strength.

She said that in various construction undertakings, thousands of activists in socialist construction resolutely listen to the Party's words, closely connect with the masses, meticulously care for the masses, and at all times and in all places use their advanced thinking and active actions to unite and lead the broad masses of women to do everything possible to complete the tasks put forward by the Party, becoming the backbone of various mass movements and a model for the broad masses of women to learn from.

Li Dequan called on the activist representatives attending the meeting to continue to play an active role in the future and do their work even better. She said that this meeting is a good opportunity to raise awareness and enrich knowledge. Everyone should, in accordance with the spirit of the central instructions, further discuss how to better play a role in socialist construction through mutual learning and exchange of experiences.

Xu Zhizhen, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Liu Xiyuan, chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, delivered speeches at the meeting, congratulating the convening of this representative meeting and expressing congratulations and respect to women across the country who have achieved brilliant achievements with their hard work on all fronts of socialist construction.

Xu Zhizhen said that in the mass movement of vigorously developing industry with steel as the key link, on the agricultural production front, and on the cultural, educational, scientific, and artistic fronts, women have made outstanding contributions. Women work together with men, learn together, help each other, and progress together. Now women across the country are full of joy and happiness, living a happy life with a relaxed mind that they have never had before.

Xu Zhizhen said that the people of the whole country and the working class of the whole country are all delighted and encouraged by every achievement made by women on various fronts. We must fully support your work.

In his speech, Liu Xiyuan hoped that the broad masses of women would not only continue to bravely and actively participate in production labor on the industrial and agricultural fronts, but also make the greatest efforts to participate in and run collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens. He also hoped that women would continue to raise their socialist and communist ideological awareness and pay more attention to learning cultural, scientific, and technical knowledge. He said that young women should become the most active force in learning various cultural and scientific knowledge.

After the speeches were completed, a gift-presenting team composed of 800 women from all walks of life in Beijing presented gifts to the meeting.

The meeting will continue tomorrow.

    妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议隆重开幕
    据新华社3日讯  全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议今天下午在北京隆重开幕。
    中共中央政治局委员彭德怀和中共中央书记处书记黄克诚出席了今天的大会。彭德怀代表中共中央在大会上致词。  （致词全文另发）
    在今天大会会场里，坐满了来自全国二十八个省（自治区）、市和中共中央直属机关、中央国家机关和部队的二千五百多名妇女积极分子。她们包括了三十九个不同的民族，其中有八十四岁高龄的老人，也有十二岁的小姑娘。她们都是由于在党的领导下，同广大妇女群众和全国人民一起，在不同的生产劳动和工作岗位上，做出了出色的成绩，而被选拔来参加这次大会的。
    在会场入口处的一块紫色的丝绒屏风上面，写着几个金色的大字：“提高觉悟，学好本领，为建设社会主义奋勇前进！”这个口号标志着这次大会的总精神和当前全国妇女的战斗任务。
    “鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”，标明党的总路线的这个巨幅标语，也在会场上醒目地悬挂着。
    大会主席台上悬挂着毛泽东主席的画像，两旁矗立着十二面红旗。棕树和鲜花把主席台装饰得美丽而庄严。
    在主席台上，坐着一百零一位这次会议主席团的成员。她们之中除了全国妇联和部分省（自治区）、市妇联的负责人外，还包括各个战线上的先进人物和代表人物。这里有新中国第一个女农业科学研究员张秋香，著名的农业劳动模范申纪兰，著名的纺织工业劳动模范裔式娟，钢铁姑娘丘三娥，改进工序四个月完成五年任务的机械工人尉凤英，内蒙古草原上的牧业生产合作社社长那布其，傣族捕鼠能手曹依秀，著名演员舒绣文，模范女教师李惠珍，优秀的食堂炊事员陈七妹；北京妇女商店的代表兰玉珍和模范烈士家属徐大妈等。
    今天的大会在下午二时三十分开始。乐队高奏国歌以后，由全国妇女联合会副主席李德全致开幕词。
    李德全说，这次大会是社会主义建设各个战线上优秀女战士的会师大会，是大跃进中全国妇女的伟大成就的检阅大会，是妇女为促进社会主义建设更大的跃进的誓师大会。
    她说，这个大会是在我国社会主义建设全面大跃进的新形势下召开的。在全面大跃进中，我国妇女的共产主义觉悟有了很大的提高。参加社会劳动的人数大大增多，劳动范围空前扩大，在工农业生产和各项建设事业中作出了重大贡献。
    李德全着重指出，适应着生产和群众生活的需要，农村人民公社和许多城市举办了大量的集体生活福利设施，正在使分散的家务劳动变成社会集体事业。这样，许多妇女就能集中更大的精力从事劳动生产和学习，就能够更充分地发挥妇女的智慧和力量。
    她说，在各项建设事业中，成千上万的建设社会主义积极分子，坚决听党的话，密切联系群众，细致地关心群众，随时随地以自己的先进思想和积极行动，团结和带动广大妇女千方百计地完成党所提出的任务，成为各项群众运动中的骨干和广大妇女学习的榜样。
    李德全号召参加大会的积极分子代表们今后要继续发挥积极作用，把工作做得更好。她说，这次大会就是提高觉悟、丰富知识的好机会。大家要根据中央指示的精神，通过互相学习，交流经验，来进一步讨论在社会主义建设事业中，怎样更好地发挥作用。
    中华全国总工会副主席许之桢、中华全国青年联合会主席刘西元在会上先后致词，祝贺这次代表会议的召开，并向在社会主义建设各个战线上以辛勤劳动获得辉煌成就的全国妇女表示祝贺和敬意。
    许之桢说，在以钢为纲的大办工业的群众运动中，在农业生产战线上，在文化、教育、科学、艺术战线上，妇女都有出色的贡献。妇女与男子共同劳动，共同学习，互相帮助，共同进步。现在全国妇女都是喜气洋洋，欢天喜地，过着从来没有过的心情舒畅的幸福生活。
    许之桢说，全国人民和全国工人阶级对妇女在各个战线上取得的每一个成就，无不感到欢欣鼓舞。我们必须以全力支持你们的工作。
    刘西元在致词中希望广大妇女不仅要继续英勇积极地参加工农业战线上的生产劳动，而且要用最大的努力去参加并且办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业。他还希望妇女们继续提高自己的社会主义和共产主义思想觉悟，更加重视文化科学和技术知识的学习。他说，青年妇女要成为学习各种文化科学知识的一支最积极的力量。
    在致词完毕以后，北京市各界妇女组成了八百人的献礼队向会议献礼。
    大会将在明天继续举行。
