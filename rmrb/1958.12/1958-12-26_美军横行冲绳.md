Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Tokyo dispatch: According to the Jiji Press, the atrocities committed by the U.S. military in Okinawa are increasing, causing unease among the residents of this island, which has been reduced to a U.S. military base.

Following a series of disputes between U.S. soldiers and Okinawan police, an incident recently occurred in which a U.S. soldier threw an explosive at a police substation in Koza City. News from Koza also reveals that white U.S. soldiers frequently engage in brawls with black soldiers. Similar incidents have been occurring frequently in other locations as well.

In Nago, not far north of Naha, a recent act of violence involved U.S. sailors collectively beating Okinawan residents in a restaurant, injuring more than twenty people.
