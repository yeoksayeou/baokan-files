Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: Assisted by the government, American monopoly capital is invading Africa on a large scale, plundering the resources of African countries and sucking the blood and sweat of the African people at every opportunity.

Investment Rapidly Increases to a Total Value of Two Billion US Dollars

According to the latest figures released by the US Department of Commerce, in recent years, the investment of major US companies in Africa has been increasing rapidly, and the total investment has exceeded one billion US dollars. According to the Department of Commerce, in 1950, US investment in Liberia was only 82.2 million US dollars, but by last year it had increased to 380 million US dollars; investment in the Union of South Africa also increased from 140 million US dollars to 305 million US dollars during the same period; investment in other parts of Africa increased from 107 million US dollars to 319 million US dollars. These are only the book values of direct investment by US companies, not including various forms of indirect investment. However, sources say that, in reality, the total value of all US investment in Africa amounts to as much as two billion US dollars, about twice as much as the official figures. This trend of increasing investment continued in 1958. The Department of Commerce said that due to the "significant increase" in US companies' "interest" in African resources, their new investment south of the Sahara last year was 40 million US dollars, and this year they have acquired a large number of securities in companies in the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia, and the Union of South Africa, further penetrating Africa.

Extremely Cruel Exploitation, Astounding Profits

US companies invest in Africa with a clear purpose: to turn Africa into a source of raw materials and a market for goods firmly controlled by American monopoly capital, and to exploit cheap labor there to reap maximum profits. It is reported that the depth of exploitation and the level of profits made by US companies in Africa are astounding. For example, the United States plunders a large amount of iron ore from Liberia every year, but thanks to unequal contracts, it only pays the Liberian government five cents per ton of iron ore. In Rhodesia, in just 1955-1956, the profits of the "Rhodesia Selection Trust" controlled by US capital and the "Rhodesian Anglo American Limited" jointly operated by the US and Britain amounted to more than 170 million US dollars. According to a recent report in the British newspaper "The Scotsman," due to the high profits, about one-half of the new US investment in Africa since the war has actually come from the profits extracted locally. The newspaper also said that in addition to "political and military considerations," US investment in Africa "has the understanding that the rewards for pioneers are often greater than those when the enterprise is fully established. Therefore, Americans have been looking for opportunities to invest in the African continent."

Extracting Oil as the Main Goal, Also Seizing Other Resources

A large part of US investment in Africa is concentrated in oil extraction, estimated to account for about one-third to one-half of all investment. It is reported that in the current plan of the French De Gaulle government to auction the Sahara oil fields, the Sinclair Oil Corporation of the US Rockefeller Consortium occupies a prominent position. In addition, in Libya, Somaliland, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Mozambique, Spanish Sahara, and Portuguese Guinea, the traces of the penetration of American monopoly capital into local oil fields can be seen everywhere.

American monopoly capital also frantically plunders other mineral resources in Africa, especially rare "strategic materials." It is reported that almost all of the uranium mines in the Belgian Congo are currently controlled by American monopoly capital, and the vast majority of uranium produced in South Africa is also exported to the United States. American companies have also separately seized the mining rights for manganese mines in Middle Congo, Gabon, and Ghana, the exploration and mining rights for copper, zinc, and aluminum mines in Equatorial Africa, and the copper mining rights in Rhodesia, among others.

Purchasing Products at Low Prices, Selling Surplus Goods at High Prices

The United States also plunders African countries through unequal trade relations and so-called "foreign aid." According to US newspapers, the average annual trade volume between the United States and Africa has been around 1 billion US dollars in recent years. The United States, on the one hand, reduces the prices of products from African countries, and on the other hand, sells its surplus products at high prices, which has largely created an unstable state of foreign trade in many African countries. Moreover, since many raw material bases rely on US investment, they are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the US economic crisis.

As for "aid," the US authorities are most interested in using the name of "aid" to explore and exploit the resources of African countries and to tie African countries to the US war preparations plan. It is merely a tool for the US expansion in Africa.

    掠夺自然资源  吸吮人民血汗
    美国垄断资本大举渗入非洲
    新华社9日讯  华盛顿消息：美国垄断资本在政府的协助下正在大举侵入非洲，它们无孔不入地掠夺非洲国家的资源，吸吮非洲人民的血汗。投资迅速增加总值廿亿美元
    根据美国商务部发表的最新数字，最近几年来，美国大企业在非洲的投资一直在迅速增加，投资总额已经超过十亿美元。据商务部说，在1950年，美国在利比里亚的投资还只有八千二百万美元，而到去年已增加到三亿八千万美元；在南非联邦的投资同一期间也从一亿四千万美元增加到三亿零五百万美元；在非洲其他部分的投资从一亿零七百万美元增加到三亿一千九百万美元。这些还只是美国公司的直接投资的账面价值，不包括形形式式的间接投资在内。但是，有消息说，实际上，美国在非洲的全部投资的总值多达二十亿美元，比官方数字约多一倍。这种投资增加的趋势在1958年还在继续着。商务部说，由于美国公司对非洲资源的“兴趣”“显著增加”，它们去年在撒哈拉以南的新投资就有四千万美元，而在今年它们又大量收购比属刚果、北罗得西亚和南非联邦等地企业的证券，进一步打入非洲。剥削极为残酷利润大得惊人
    美国大公司在非洲投资怀着一个明显的目的：要把非洲变成由美国垄断资本牢牢控制的原料供应地和商品销售地，并且在那里剥削廉价的劳动力，牟取最大的利润。据报道，美国公司在非洲剥削程度之深和利润之高是惊人的，例如美国每年都在利比里亚掠夺大量铁矿砂，但靠着不平等的合同，每吨铁矿砂只付给利比里亚政府五分美元。在罗得西亚，仅仅在1955—1956年内，美国资本控制的“罗得西亚选矿托拉斯”和美英合办的“罗得西亚英美有限公司”的利润就高达一亿七千多万美元。据英国“苏格兰人报”不久前报道，由于利润的丰厚，美国公司战后以来在非洲的新投资约有二分之一实际是来自它们在当地榨取的利润。这家报纸还说，除了“政治和军事的考虑”以外，美国在非洲投资“有这样一种认识，就是开拓者所得到的报酬往往比在企业完全建立时的报酬为大。因此，美国人一直在寻找在非洲大陆进行投资的机会”。榨取石油为主也抢其他资源
    美国在非洲的投资很大一部分集中在石油开采方面，估计约占全部投资三分之一到二分之一。据报道，在目前法国戴高乐政府拍卖撒哈拉油田的计划中，美国洛克菲勒财团的辛克莱石油公司就占有显著地位。此外在利比亚、索马里兰、象牙海岸、埃塞俄比亚、突尼斯、莫三鼻给、西属撒哈拉和葡属几内亚等地，无不看到美国垄断资本渗入当地油田的痕迹。
    美国垄断资本还疯狂地掠夺非洲的其他矿物资源，特别是稀有的“战略原料”。据报道，目前比属刚果的铀矿差不多全部都控制在美国垄断资本手中，南非所生产的铀绝大部分也输往美国。美国公司同时还分别夺取了中刚果、加蓬和加纳等地的锰矿开采权，赤道非洲的铜、锌和铝矿的勘察和开采权，罗得西亚的铜矿开采权等等。低价收购产品高价推销剩货美国还通过不平等的贸易关系和所谓“对外援助”等来掠夺非洲国家。据美国报刊报道，美国近来同非洲的贸易额平均每年在十亿美元左右，美国一方面压价收购非洲国家的产品，另一方面高价推销美国的剩余产品，这就在很大程度上造成了非洲许多国家对外贸易的不稳定状态，再加以许多原料基地都是靠美国的投资，因此特别容易受到美国经济危机的影响。
    至于“援助”，美国当局最感兴趣的是借“援助”之名来勘察和开采非洲国家的资源以及把非洲国家缚在美国的备战计划上，它也只是美国对非洲扩张的一个工具。
