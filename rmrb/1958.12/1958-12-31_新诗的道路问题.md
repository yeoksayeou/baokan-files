The Question of the Path for New Poetry
Sha Ou

I

1958 was a glorious and brilliant year.

As the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out, "The great leap forward in all aspects of industrial and agricultural production and scientific and cultural education in our country in 1958, the great increase in the socialist and communist consciousness of the people, and the high tide of people's communes that emerged between this summer and autumn are a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction..."

In such a great, victorious, and heroic era, the working people, with communist spirit and earth-shattering revolutionary vigor, were spiritedly engaged in unprecedented undertakings to build socialism. Their lofty aspirations and great achievements needed our poets to express them.

Over the past year, poets have enthusiastically praised the Great Leap Forward, praised the working people's soaring fighting spirit and creative miracles. Although poets have made great efforts, it is still far from enough. The working people are using poetry to express themselves. They themselves have created millions of new folk songs, strongly expressing their heroic spirit, their infinite love and loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, their joy in labor and praise for labor, and their soaring enthusiasm and the magnificent picture of the Great Leap Forward. The new folk songs shook the poetry scene with dazzling brilliance, opened a new poetic style, and attracted great attention.

This is the fact placed before the poets that makes them extremely excited and that they cannot but bravely advance.

The magnificent reality of the Great Leap Forward strongly demands that poets reflect it with excellent works; and the working people are also creating poetry very well, writing works that achieve a high degree of integration of ideology and artistry. We know that poetry is not like film. For the working people, film is a matter of whether they like to watch it or not, but poetry is being written by the working masses themselves. If new poetry is not loved by the working people, they can replace it with their own poetry.

In the face of such facts, it is easy to understand why a discussion on the development path of new poetry has unfolded. As one comrade put it well, "New folk songs have checkmated the poets!" Yes, poets cannot but consider many issues. Since the beginning of this year, literary publications such as "Stars," "Poetry Journal," and "Virgin Land" have successively launched discussions on the issue of the development path of poetry. This warm discussion shows that the issue of the development path of new poetry is not only a concern for poets, but also a concern for the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and cadres. The discussion involved many issues, and the opinions were inconsistent. This is also a very natural thing.

This discussion is undoubtedly timely and necessary. It will promote the continued development of Chinese new poetry.

II

If we leave the current social conditions and the demands made on poets by real life to discuss how new poetry should develop, it will be difficult to solve the problem. If we do not study the current situation of new poetry and its existing weaknesses to discuss how new poetry should develop, it will also be difficult to solve the problem.

Therefore, it is necessary to briefly review the situation of new poetry over the past year.

Obviously, new folk songs have influenced new poetry. This influence is mainly reflected in the fact that the works of some poets are closer to folk songs in form, language, and style; we can clearly see this in some recent works by Comrades Guo Moruo, Tian Jian, Li Ji, He Jingzhi, and Guo Xiaochuan. This is certainly a good influence. We also see another situation, that is, some poets' works only imitate the folk song form in form, and not only lack the style and spirit of the working people in their thoughts and feelings, but also are awkward in language, such as Cai Qijiao's mountain songs. Of course, learning from new folk songs is always a good thing. The problem is that not many very exciting works that are loved by the working people have appeared in the poets' creations over the past year.

The influence of new folk songs reflected in the works of poets shows that poets are trying to change their poetic style and are exploring. However, although foreign accents are less common, outstanding works are not common, and the influence of new poetry among the working masses is not great, indicating that poets need to continue to explore. Precisely because of this, the issue of the development path of new poetry has become a matter of concern for many people.

Although many questions have been raised in the discussion articles, such as whether new folk songs are the mainstream, whether the folk song form is limited, whether "new metrical poetry" can be established, how to evaluate new poetry since the May Fourth Movement... I think the central issue of the development path of new poetry is how to combine new poetry well with the working masses.

This has been a fundamental problem that has existed in new poetry since the May Fourth Movement. After the national liberation, especially in the past year, although great progress has been made, this problem has still not been fundamentally solved. Therefore, for today's new poetry, it is still a central problem that must be solved.

Judging from the tendency of poets to begin to change their poetic style, this is the problem; judging from the expectations of real life and the working people for poets, this is the problem; judging from the Party's requirements for poets, this is also the problem. Obviously, if we do not study how to combine new poetry well with the working people, new poetry cannot be developed. If we leave the issue of how to combine well with the working people to discuss how new poetry should develop, it would be shooting without a target and would be meaningless.

We need to correctly understand the content included in the good combination of new poetry and the working masses. I think it should include the following three points:

1.  To truthfully reflect the lives of the working people;
2.  To truthfully express the thoughts, feelings, voices, smiles, style and spirit of the working people;
3.  To have a form that is loved and welcomed by the working people.

It is not possible without this. To truthfully reflect the lives of the working masses, it is necessary to have the thoughts and feelings of the working masses, which is beyond doubt. If it is not the language of the working masses, or the form that is loved and welcomed by the working masses, they will not like it, or even pay attention to it. It can be seen that these three points are indispensable, and these three points are closely related.

From these three conditions, there are both issues of ideological content and issues of poetic form. Grasping only ideological content, or only grasping form, is walking on one leg and is incomplete.

The development of new poetry must solve this central problem.

Although, for individual poets, some solve it better, and some are slower, but from the perspective of the entire new poetry, not being well combined with the working masses is a fundamental weakness, so the path of development of new poetry can only start here.

III

If we talk about shortcomings, new poetry has not fully reflected this magnificent real life. The heroic spirit of the working people has not been fully expressed in new poetry.

To solve the problem of new poetry being able to truthfully reflect the lives of the working people, to truthfully express the thoughts, feelings, voices, smiles, style and spirit of the working people, we must first solve the issue of the poet's position and attitude, and solve the issue of the poet's familiarity with the object he is describing. The two are related and different. If the poet's position and attitude are correct, if he is not familiar with the object he is describing, the hero will have no use for his talents. If the poet's position and attitude are not correct, although he is very familiar with the object he is describing, there can be no truthful reflection.

Therefore, poets going deep into life, sharing weal and woe with the working masses, working and struggling with them, and understanding and familiarizing themselves with the working masses in the fiery struggle; and tempering and transforming themselves in the fiery mass struggle, is the only good way. Because without this, it is impossible to truly understand the working masses. Without understanding the working masses, there is no way to truthfully reflect their lives, let alone truthfully reflect their thoughts, feelings, voices, smiles, style and spirit.

Over the past year, the down-to-earth training of writers and poets has shown good results, and the works of many poets living among the masses have received good evaluations from readers. Future works will powerfully prove the great power of this policy.

Because poets live among the working masses, they can not only fundamentally solve the problem of the subject matter of poetry creation, but also fundamentally solve the problem of language. The issue of language is an important issue for new poetry, as it relates to whether the working masses understand it and like it. A poet who lives with the working masses will understand that foreign accents and foreign bureaucratic language have no market. And language is directly related to form.

IV

To make new poetry loved and welcomed by the working masses, in addition to factors such as thought, content, and language, there is also the issue of form.

Over the past year, there have been the most articles arguing about the issue of form. The many arguments show that the issue of form is indeed a problem, and it is a concern for everyone. There is no benefit in avoiding this problem. Because the form of new poetry does have problems, such as being difficult to read aloud, and even difficult to understand.

Many divergent opinions on the issue of form arise from discussions of new folk songs.

One view is: new folk songs only win with content, and the form is old, not worth mentioning. For example, Comrade Bian Zhilin said in "A Few Views on the Development of New Poetry" ("Virgin Land" July 1958): "But to ask us to learn folk songs, it is not to ask us to imitate them blindly to learn how to 'write' folk songs, because that can only be a forgery, destined to fail." He Qifang also said in "On the Issue of 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' for New Poetry" published in the same issue of "Virgin Land": "What attracts people most about the Great Leap Forward ballads and past revolutionary ballads is not their form..." This argument does not see that some excellent new folk songs have reached a considerable degree of perfection in the unity of content and form; the essence of this argument is to despise folk poetry forms, and to ignore the fact that these old forms, in the hands of the working masses, have been transformed into revolutionary things that serve the people.

One view is: there is nothing to learn from the form of new folk songs, and a "new metrical poetry" or "modern metrical poetry" should be established that includes all the advantages of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. For example, Comrade Bian Zhilin said in "Where is the Divergence": "In the past, my consideration of the problem of new poetry metrics was based on the practice of poetry creation since the May Fourth Movement, based on the characteristics of modern spoken language, and with reference to the laws of classical poetry and Western poetry, I conducted exploration under the guidance of the basic principles of Chinese and foreign poetry rhythm." ("Poetry Journal" November 1958) Comrade He Qifang also said: "The style of folk song form is very limited, far less varied and rich than the modern metrical poetry I advocate." This disregards the habits of the working masses who like to see and hear, and disregards the fact that the working masses are creating millions of new folk songs, which is a kind of closed-door thinking. Of course, it is possible to build a car behind closed doors, but the masses do not like to ride this car, and cannot ride it. In recent years, some people have made this attempt, such as nine-character poems and sonnets, all of which have disappeared like bubbles. Poets can make various attempts, but daydreams are not possible. Because the development of form cannot be transferred with the design drawings drawn by a certain poet behind closed doors, it has its own objective laws of development.

One view is: the debate on the issue of poetic form is an issue of literary and artistic policy, and a political issue. For example, Comrade Li Yaqun said in "My Opinion on the Issue of Sending Poetry Down to the Countryside" ("Stars" November 1958), when discussing whether the folk song form is good or the free verse form is good: "In fact, it is still related to the issue of literary and artistic policy, that is, whether or not one is willing to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and also the issue of who one follows." This statement is excessive. If it is aimed at certain bourgeois formalists, and at certain people who use bourgeois prejudices to ridicule new folk songs, it is not impossible. But it cannot be generalized. For example, the form of rhythmic quatrains can serve the feudal class, and it can also serve the people. For example, the form of free verse can be mastered by right-wing poets, and it can also be mastered by revolutionary poets. This is not to say that form is completely unrelated to content, I just want to explain that if we simply regard the issue of form as an issue of who leads whom, it will be difficult to explain many good poems, such as some early works of Comrade Guo Moruo, or some works of Comrade Tian Jian in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is necessary to emphasize new folk songs, and it is also necessary to encourage people to learn from new folk songs, and it is also a fact that the folk song form is loved by the working people, but it cannot be emphasized to the extent that there is only one store, and no other branches. If this is the case, it will not only be impossible to explain the phenomenon of poems that have different forms and can all serve socialism well, but also be unfavorable to the blooming of a hundred flowers. This argument, in essence, regards content as an appendage of form, and obliterates content. We cannot require poets to write in the folk song form. Some poets do not write in the folk song form, and it does not necessarily mean that their works must be foreign accents, nor does it necessarily mean that there is a directional error.

One view is: the folk song form has limitations. This opinion has two sources, one source is to use the statement of "limited" to negate new folk songs, or to despise new folk songs, which is obviously incorrect. The arguments of He Qifang and Bian Zhilin have this tendency. The other source is to explore why the authors of new folk songs can use the restricted form freely, and to explore how new folk songs will develop. I think this statement is correct and beneficial.

One view is: the folk song form has no limitations. For example, Comrade Li Yaqun said in the same article: "It is unreasonable to say that the folk song itself has limitations and a small capacity." This statement is unscientific, because any form has its limitations. If we believe that the folk song form has no limitations, then the folk song form is perfect and ends here, and it is impossible to develop further. And the changes that have appeared in the form of new folk songs cannot be explained. This is a metaphysical point of view.

Generally speaking, there are some different views on the issue of form. In these debates, for example, the issue of whether the folk song form is limited or not, whether from the perspective of promoting the development of new poetry, or from the perspective of creative practice, the practical significance is not great.

The issue of form cannot be discussed without the content it expresses. This is well known. The issue of form must also be discussed in connection with the habits and preferences of the working people, because new poetry is written for the working masses to see. Therefore, although the changes in form are determined by changes in real life, the exploration of poets, and external influences, etc., the reason why form should change in this way, and not in that way, cannot but be restricted by the language, emotions, habits, and preferences of the nation.

From the articles in the debate, when discussing the issue of poetic form, the emphasis is on discussing the issue of genre and format. We know that the concept of poetic form contains a much wider range of content. The image determined by content, as well as genre, format, structure, technique, rhythm and other things, should all belong to the concept of form. And these are realized by using language. Therefore, if we regard form only as an issue of how many characters, it is inevitably too simple. This will hardly help the development of new poetry.

If we do not go around in circles in terms of concepts, and start from the actual practice of poetry creation, we will see such facts on the issue of form.

1.  The folk song form that is popular today is generally based on five-character and seven-character lines. Although this form has a long history, it still has a strong life force today. The working people want to write poetry, and they cannot establish a form on an empty field, so they naturally want to use the old form. It is worth noting that they use it skillfully and express themselves freely. Therefore, it will continue to exist. Today, it has become a major form.
2.  Many works in new folk songs have broken through the limitations of the folk song form in terms of syllables, number of lines, number of characters, or rhyme. This shows that the folk song form is changing, and new forms have begun to sprout. This change is not developing in the direction of free verse, but is slightly freer than the original appearance of the folk song form. For example, it has not abandoned the sense of rhythm displayed by clear syllables, nor has it taken off the harmony and sonority expressed by rhyme.
3.  In the creation of poets, they are approaching the folk song form. Some are writing relatively neat folk song forms, and some are exploring (such as Li Ji's long poem "May Duan Yang"). And fewer and fewer people are writing free verse. This trend is worth noting. It shows that the poetic form of poets is changing (not only are the format, rhythm, etc. belonging to the form changing, but also the language is changing). This change cannot but be diverse. In this change, poets naturally have to consider the issue of inheriting the tradition of Chinese classical poetry (such as Zhang Guangnian's "Sanmenxia Grand Chorus", "Sai Shang Xing", He Jingzhi's "Sanmenxia Song").
4.  The form of old-style poetry (such as rhythmic poems, quatrains, lyrics, etc.) is still continuing to serve socialism.

This is the basic appearance of today's poetic form.

This appearance makes people see a prospect. That is, the changes in the folk song form and the changes in the form that poets have long been accustomed to using tend to be closer. I think the development of the form of new poetry will follow this path. New poetry must be well combined with the working masses, it must change its form, and it must make its form more national. It will not work without this. The opinions of the broad masses on the form of new poetry must be valued. The changes that have begun now are gratifying, although they are just beginning. The acceleration of the intellectualization of the working people and the laborization of intellectuals will accelerate the changes in poetic form. Of course, we cannot expect a form to appear to replace the various forms of today, which is impossible. It is also of little significance to insist on which form is the mainstream. The road to the development of form can only be a road of letting a hundred flowers bloom and various forms competing with each other. It is impossible to imagine that our working masses will only love one flower; insisting that our working masses only love one flower will only be detrimental to the prosperity of poetry creation and detrimental to poets making bold attempts in form. Comrade Li Yaqun said: "Learning from folk songs means developing new poetry on this basis, which is not at all contradictory to 'Let a hundred flowers bloom'" (ibid.). If we understand this sentence as letting a hundred flowers bloom on the basis of the folk song form, it will narrow the broad road of development of new poetry. For example, the old folk song form mainly based on five-character and seven-character lines will still exist, the free verse form will still exist, and the old-style poetry form will still exist. But new forms will inevitably appear. It will become an opposite of some works of new poetry since the May Fourth Movement that have deviated from the national form. This new form is of course not designed by a certain poet in the house, it can only be the natural result of the development of new poetry. And the development of new poetry in form cannot be imagined if it is separated from the creative labor of professional poets and mass poets.

Is this trend of development good? I think it is good. Poets seriously learning new folk songs will undoubtedly accelerate this trend. In this process, it will enable the form of new poetry to take root in the love and habits of the working masses, and also take root in tradition. It is the product of poets' diligent exploration in order to make the working masses like to see and hear.

We can imagine that on the road of development of new poetry, in the increasingly better combination of new poetry and the working masses, there will surely be works that are both popular and improved; works that are both shining with the light of communism and have very perfect artistic form; in terms of form, works that are both national and letting a hundred flowers bloom.

    新诗的道路问题
    沙鸥 
    一
    1958年是一个辉煌灿烂的年代。
    正如党的八届六中全会公报中所指出，
  “1958年我国工农业生产和科学文化教育事业各方面的大跃进，人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟的大大提高，以及在今年夏秋之间出现的人民公社化高潮，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利……。”
    在这样一个伟大胜利的、英雄的年代里，劳动人民以共产主义风格和移山倒海的革命干劲，意气风发地为建设社会主义干了史无前例的事业，他们的雄心壮志与丰功伟绩，多么需要我们的诗人们去表现。
    一年来，诗人们满怀热情地歌颂了大跃进，歌颂了劳动人民昂扬的斗志和创造的奇迹，诗人们虽然作了很大的努力，但是还很不够。劳动人民用诗歌来表现自己了。他们自己创造了数以百万计的新民歌，强烈地表现了他们的英雄面貌，表现了他们对党和毛主席的无限热爱与忠诚，表现了他们在劳动中的欢乐与对劳动的赞颂，表现了他们的冲天干劲和大跃进的波澜壮阔的图景。新民歌以夺目的光彩震动了诗坛，开了一代诗风，引起了人们巨大的注意。
    这就是摆在面前使诗人们万分激动，又使诗人们不能不勇猛前进的事实。
    大跃进的壮丽的现实生活，强烈地向诗人们提出了要求，需要他们用优美的作品来反映；而劳动人民又十分出色地在进行诗歌创作，他们写出了一些思想性与艺术性达到高度结合的作品。我们知道，诗歌不比电影，劳动人民对电影说来，是爱看不爱看的问题，而诗歌，劳动群众是自己在写了。如果新诗不被劳动人民喜爱，他们就可以用自己的诗歌来代替。
    在这样的事实面前，展开了关于新诗发展道路问题的讨论，是很容易理解的了。有一位同志说得好：“新民歌向诗人们将了一军！”是的，诗人们不能不考虑许多问题。自今年年初开始，像“星星”、“诗刊”、“处女地”等文学刊物，都先后展开了诗歌发展道路问题的讨论。这种热烈的讨论表明了新诗发展道路的问题不仅仅是诗人们关心的问题，也是工人、农民、战士、干部等广大群众所关心的问题了。讨论中涉及的问题很多，意见也不一致。这也是很自然的事情。
    这种讨论无疑是及时的、必要的。它将推动中国新诗继续向前发展。
    二
    如果离开了当前的社会条件，离开了现实生活向诗人们提出的要求，来讨论新诗该如何发展，是不容易解决问题的。如果不研究一下当前新诗的状况和存在的弱点，来讨论新诗该如何发展，也是不容易解决问题的。
    因此，有必要简略地回顾一下一年来新诗的状况。
    显然，新民歌已给新诗带来了影响。这种影响主要表现在一些诗人的作品在形式、语言及风格上，更接近民歌了；我们从郭沫若、田间、李季、贺敬之、郭小川等同志的一部分近作中，可以很明显地看出来。这当然是好的影响。我们也看见另外一种情况，那就是有些诗人的作品，只是在形式上模仿民歌体，不仅思想感情缺乏劳动人民的风格与气派，在语言上也别别扭扭，如蔡其矫同志的山歌。当然，向新民歌学习总是好事情。问题在于一年来诗人们的创作中还没有出现较多的十分激动人心、为劳动人民喜闻乐见的作品。
    诗人们的作品中反映出从新民歌所受到的影响，说明诗人们在尝试着改变诗风，在探求。可是，洋腔洋调虽然不多见了，而出色的作品也不多见，新诗在劳动群众中的影响还不大，说明诗人们还需要继续不断地探求。正因为如此，新诗发展道路的问题，就成为许多人关心的问题了。
    尽管在讨论的文章中，提出了许许多多的问题，例如：新民歌是不是主流的问题，民歌体有无限制的问题，“新格律诗”能不能建立的问题，对五四以来的新诗如何估价的问题……我认为新诗发展道路的中心问题是新诗如何与劳动群众很好结合的问题。
    这是“五四”以来的新诗一直存在着的一个根本问题，全国解放之后，特别是一年来，虽然是大大前进了一步，但仍然没有根本解决这个问题。因而对今天的新诗说来，还是一个必须解决的中心问题。
    从诗人们正在开始改变诗风的倾向来看，是这个问题；从现实生活与劳动人民对诗人们的期待来看，是这个问题；从党对诗人们的要求来看，也是这个问题。显然，如果不研究如何使新诗与劳动群众很好地结合，新诗就不可能得到发展。如果离开了如何与劳动人民很好结合，来讨论新诗怎样发展，便是无的放矢，没有意义。
    我们需要正确地来理解新诗和劳动群众很好结合所包含的内容，我想，应包含下列三条：
    一、要真实地反映劳动人民的生活；
    二、要真实地表现劳动人民的思想感情，声音笑貌，风格和气魄；
    三、要具有劳动人民喜闻乐见的形式。
    不这样是不行的。要真实地反映劳动群众的生活，必须有劳动群众的思想感情，这是毫无疑问的了。如果不是用的劳动群众的语言，不是用的劳动群众喜闻乐见的形式，他们也不会喜爱，甚至不会理睬的。可见，这三条是缺一不可的，而这三条又是紧密地联系着的。
    从这三个条件来看，既有思想内容的问题，也有诗歌形式的问题。只抓住了思想内容，或只抓住形式，都是一条腿走路，都是不完全的。
    新诗的发展必须解决这个中心问题。
    虽然，对个别诗人说来，有的解决得好一些，有的脚步迟缓一些，但从整个新诗来看，没有与劳动群众很好结合，却是一个根本的弱点，因而新诗发展的道路，只能从这里开步走。
    三
    如果谈缺点的话，新诗是没有充分地反映这波澜壮阔的现实生活。劳动人民的英雄面貌，在新诗中也没有得到充分的表现。
    要解决新诗能真实地反映劳动人民的生活，能真实地表现劳动人民的思想感情，声音笑貌，风格和气魄的问题，首先就要解决诗人的立场、态度的问题，要解决诗人对他所描写的对象十分熟悉的问题。两者有联系，又有区别。诗人的立场、态度对头了，如果对描写的对象不熟悉，英雄就无用武之地。诗人的立场、态度如果不对头，虽然对描写的对象很熟悉，也不可能有真实的反映。
    因此，诗人们深入生活，与劳动群众同甘共苦，同劳动，同斗争，在火热的斗争中去了解和熟悉劳动群众；在火热的群众斗争中，锻炼自己，改造自己，是唯一的好办法。因为不这样就不可能真正理解劳动群众。不理解劳动群众，就谈不上真实地反映他们的生活，就更谈不上真实地反映他们的思想感情，声音笑貌，风格与气魄了。
    一年来，作家诗人的下放锻炼已显示了良好的成果，许多生活在群众中的诗人的作品，得到了读者良好的评价。未来的作品将有力地证明这个政策的伟大力量。
    由于诗人们生活在劳动群众中，不但从根本上解决了诗歌创作的题材问题，也能从根本上解决语言的问题。语言的问题对新诗说来，是一个重要问题，它关系到劳动群众懂不懂，喜爱不喜爱的问题。一个与劳动群众生活在一起的诗人，是会了解洋腔洋调洋八股是没有市场的。而语言又与形式直接有关。
    四
    要新诗为劳动群众喜闻乐见，除了思想、内容及语言等因素之外，还有一个形式的问题。
    一年来，形式问题争论的文章最多了。争论多，说明了形式问题的确是一个问题，而且是众人关心的。避开这个问题没有好处。因为新诗的形式确实有问题，念不上口，有的甚至难懂等等。
    形式问题的许多分歧的意见，都是从讨论新民歌引起的。
    一种说法是：新民歌不过是以内容取胜，形式是旧东西，不足道。例如卞之琳同志在“对于新诗发展问题的几点看法”（“处女地”1958年7月号）一文中说：“可是要我们学习民歌，并不是要我们依样画葫芦来学‘写’民歌，因为那只能是伪造，注定要失败。”何其芳在同期的“处女地”上发表的“关于新诗的‘百花齐放’问题”一文中也说：“大跃进歌谣和过去的革命歌谣，它们最吸引人的还并不是它们的形式……。”这种论点是看不见一些优美的新民歌在内容与形式的统一上，已达到了相当完美的程度；这种论点的实质是轻视民间的诗歌形式，是忽略了这些旧形式，在劳动群众的手中，给了改造，也就变成了革命的、为人民服务的东西了。
    一种说法是：新民歌的形式无可学习的地方，应建立一种包括古今中外的一切优点的“新格律诗”或“现代格律诗”。例如卞之琳同志在“分歧在哪里”一文中说：“我过去考虑新诗格律问题，就是根据了‘五四’以来诗歌创作的实践，根据了现代口语的特点，参考了古典诗歌和西方诗歌的规律，在中外诗歌音律的基本原理的指导下，进行了探索。”（“诗刊”1958年11月号）何其芳同志也说：“民歌体的体裁是很有限的，远不如我所主张的现代格律诗变化多，样式丰富。”这是不顾劳动群众喜见乐闻的习惯，不顾劳动群众正在创作数以百万计的新民歌的事实，这是一种闭门造车的想法。当然，闭起门来是可以造车的，但这个车子群众不喜欢坐，也无法坐的。几年来，已有人作过这种尝试，比如九言体，十四行之类，都如泡沫一样无影无踪了。诗人是可以作各种尝试，但空想是不行的。因为形式的发展不可能随某个诗人关起门来画设计的图样为转移，它有它的客观的发展规律。
    一种说法是：诗的形式问题的争论是文艺方针的问题，是个政治问题。例如李亚群同志在“我对诗歌下放问题的意见”一文中（“星星”1958年11月号），在论述民歌体好或是自由体好时说：“其实还是有关文艺方针的问题，亦即愿不愿为工农兵服务的问题，也是谁跟谁走的问题。”这种说法是过分了。如果是针对某些资产阶级的形式主义者，针对某些用资产阶级的偏见嘲笑新民歌的人而言，也不是不可以。但不能一概而论。比如律词绝句这种形式，它既可以为封建阶级服务，也可以为人民服务。比如自由诗这种形式，它既可以为右派诗人所掌握，也可以为革命诗人所掌握。这不是说形式是可以与内容完全无关的，我只想说明如果简单地把形式问题当成一个谁领导谁的问题，许多好诗如郭沫若同志早期的一些作品，或田间同志在抗战初期的一些作品就难于解释。强调新民歌是必要的，鼓励人们向新民歌学习也是必要的，民歌体为劳动人民所喜爱，也是事实，但是，不能强调到只此一家、别无分店的程度。如果这样，既不能解释形式各别，而都能很好地为社会主义服务的诗歌现象，也不利于百花齐放。这种论点，实质上是把内容当成形式的附属物来看待了，是把内容抹煞了。不能要求诗人们都来写民歌体。有的诗人不写民歌体，也并不等于他的作品一定就是洋腔洋调，也并不等于就是有方针性的错误。
    一种说法是：民歌体有限制。这个意见有两个来源，一个来源是为了用“有限制”的说法，来否定新民歌，或轻视新民歌，这显然是不正确的。如何其芳、卞之琳同志的论点就有这种倾向。另一个来源是为了探讨新民歌的作者何以在有限制的形式中能运用自如，为了探讨新民歌会如何发展。我认为这种说法是正确的，也是有益的。
    一种说法是：民歌体毫无限制。例如李亚群同志在同一篇文章中说：“说民歌本身有局限性，容量不大，那是没有道理的。”这种说法是不科学的，因为任何形式都有它限制的一面。如果认为民歌体毫无限制，那么，民歌体就尽善尽美，到此为止了，不可能再向前发展了。而新民歌在形式上已出现的变化，就无法解释了。这是一种形而上学的观点。
    大体说来，在形式问题上就有这样一些不同的看法。在这些争论中，例如民歌体有无限制的问题，不论从推动新诗的发展上看，或从创作实践上看，实际的意义都是不大的。
    形式问题是不能离它所表现的内容来谈论的。这是众所皆知的了。形式问题也必须联系着劳动人民的习惯与喜爱来讨论，因为新诗是写给劳动群众看的。因此形式的变化虽然决定于现实生活的变化，诗人们的探求，以及外来的影响等等因素，但是，形式之所以要这样变，而不那样变，却不能不受民族的语言、感情、习惯、爱好等的制约。
    从争论的文章看来，在讨论诗的形式问题时，是偏重于讨论体裁和格式问题。我们知道，诗的形式这个概念所包含的内容广泛得多，那受内容决定的形象，以及体裁、格式、结构、手法、韵律等东西，都应属于形式的概念中。而这些，又是利用语言来实现的。因此，如果是把形式只当成是几言体的问题，就不免太简单了。这就很难有助于新诗的发展。
    如果我们不从概念上兜圈子，从诗歌创作的实际出发，在形式问题上便会看见这样的事实。
    一、今天流行的民歌体，一般说来，是以五七言为主。这种形式虽然由来已久，在今天依然有旺盛的生命。劳动人民要写诗，不能在空地上建立形式，他们自然要运用旧形式。值得注意的是他们运用的得心应手，畅所欲言。因而它还将存在下去。在今天，已成为一种主要的形式。
    二、新民歌中的不少作品，已突破了民歌体在音节上，行数上，字数上或韵脚上的限制。这说明民歌体在变，新形式已开始萌芽。这种变化并不是向自由诗那个方向发展，而是比民歌体原来的样子稍稍自由一些。比如，它并没有抛弃明确的音节来显示的节奏感，也并没有脱掉靠韵脚来表现的合谐、响亮等等。
    三、在诗人们的创作中，正在向民歌体接近。有的是在写比较整齐的民歌体，有的正在探索（如李季的长诗“五月端阳”的形式）。而写自由诗的逐渐少了。这种趋向值得注意。它说明诗人们的诗歌形式在变（不仅属于形式的格式、韵律等在变，语言也在变化）。这种变化不能不是多种多样的。在这种变化中，诗人们也自然要考虑继承中国古典诗歌的传统问题（如张光年的“三门峡大合唱”、“塞上行”，贺敬之的“三门峡歌”）。
    四、旧体诗的形式（如律诗、绝句、词等）也还在继续为社会主义服务。
    这就是今天的诗歌形式的基本面貌。
    这种面貌使人看出一个前景。那就是民歌体的变化与诗人们长期习惯运用的形式的变化，趋向于接近。我想新诗的形式的发展会沿着这条道路走。新诗要很好与劳动群众结合，必须要改变形式，必须使形式更富有民族性。不这样是不成的。广大群众对新诗形式的意见必须重视。现在开始的变化是可喜的，虽然是刚刚在开始。由于知识分子劳动化和劳动群众知识化的加速，会使诗歌形式的变化加速。当然，不能指望会出现一种形式来代替今天的各种形式，那是不可能的。硬要说哪种形式是主流，意义也不大。形式发展的道路，只能是百花齐放，各种形式互相竞赛的道路，不能设想我们的劳动群众会只爱一朵花；硬要说我们的劳动群众只爱一朵花，其结果只是不利于诗歌创作的繁荣，不利于诗人们在形式上去作大胆的尝试。李亚群同志说：“向民歌学习，是说在这个基础上发展新的诗歌，毫不和‘百花齐放’矛盾”（同上）。如果把这句话理解为在民歌体的基础上百花齐放，就会把新诗发展的宽广道路弄得窄小了。比如，五七言为主的旧民歌形式还会存在，自由诗这种形式也还会存在，旧体诗词的形式还会存在。但新形式也必然会出现。它会成为五四以来新诗的某些作品脱离了民族形式的对立物而出现。这种新形式当然不是由某一个诗人在屋子里设计得出来，它只能是新诗发展的自然结果。而新诗在形式上的发展，如果离开了专业诗人及群众诗人创造性的劳动，是不能设想的。
    这种发展的趋势好不好呢？我认为是好的。诗人们认真学习新民歌，毫无疑问将加速这种趋势。这种过程中，将使新诗的形式能够生根在劳动群众的喜爱及习惯上，又扎根在传统上。它是诗人们为了要劳动群众喜闻乐见的勤劳地探索的产物。
    我们可以这样设想，在新诗发展的道路上，在新诗与劳动群众越来越好的结合中，一定会出现既是普及的、又是提高的作品；既是闪耀着共产主义光芒的，又是艺术形式非常完美的作品；从形式上说来，既是民族的，又是百花齐放的作品。
