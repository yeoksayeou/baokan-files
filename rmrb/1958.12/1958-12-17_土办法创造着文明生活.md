　　Indigenous Methods Create Civilized Life
　　By Our Correspondents Yú Míng, Yú Fēng

　　Once you arrive in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, you can see that a large amount of biogas can be extracted from the most ordinary sewage mud ponds for lighting, cooking, and power generation.

　　In front of the No. 6 Dining Hall of the residents of Dasi in the urban area, we saw two young people rowing around in the pond. Each side of the boat carried three wooden boxes inverted in the water. The young men stirred the mud at the bottom of the pond as they rowed, and bubbles kept rising around the boat. Comrade Sun Yongxi, the County Head of Fuyang, told us that they were capturing biogas. He said that the small boxes hanging on both sides of the boat have no bottoms, they are called "movable covers," and each cover has a "gas outlet pipe." The rower stirs the mud underwater with a bamboo pole, the biogas rises, and is collected in the "movable cover."

　　After a while, the movable cover is filled with biogas (the movable cover is pushed higher and higher by the biogas). Another young man brings three car inner tubes and a wet cloth bag. They connect the "gas outlet pipe" of the movable cover, and two people press down on the cover. The biogas inflates the car tubes and bag in a few minutes. The two young men come out, light the gas pipe of the car tube with a match, and the biogas immediately burns at the pipe opening. County Head Sun said with a smile, "They are putting on a show for you!" He said that this is a biogas supply station. When other units and people need to use biogas, they use car tubes, oilcloth bags, or even pants to pack it, transport it home for lighting and cooking, and can even store it when it is not in use.

　　After watching the capturing and transporting of biogas, County Head Sun and the comrades of the residents committee warmly invited us to drink "biogas tea" and eat "biogas rice" in the No. 6 Dining Hall. Therefore, we had the opportunity to visit the kitchen. At the entrance of the kitchen, we saw two large water tanks filled with water, and each tank was covered with a "movable cover" like the one on the boat. The comrades in the dining hall told us that this is called a gas storage tank. The biogas transported from the pond is stored in the tank and can be used at any time.

　　A Spotless Kitchen
　　When we entered the kitchen, we were amazed! This kitchen was truly surprising. The paper pasted on the ceiling, the lime on the stove, and the aprons worn by the cooks were all white and clean. Except for the biogas bags that had just been brought in, there was no firewood or coal on the floor. Inside the room, there were only two large pot stoves, and a small mud stove was placed on the stove platform. The cook connected the rubber tube on the biogas bag to the reed stalk, inserted the reed stalk into a hole next to the mud stove, and lit it with a match on top of the earthen stove. The many small holes in the furnace of the earthen stove roared with fire. Half a pot of cold water sitting on the stove boiled in just four or five minutes to make tea, so we drank "biogas tea." The cook put the reed stalk into the furnace of the large pot stove to stir-fry dishes and cook rice. The cook worked calmly, and in half an hour, we were eating "biogas rice." We were particularly interested in the large pot stove, which had no chimney to let out smoke and no ash passage to leak ash. Because cooking with biogas does not require firewood or coal, there is no smoke or ash. The simplicity of cooking with biogas, the cleanliness of the whole room, and the ease of labor for the cooks made us feel as if we were in an electrified kitchen. This is truly living a civilized life with indigenous methods. According to them, in this dining hall alone, 140 people have been living such a refined life for several months.

　　As we were eating dinner, we suddenly heard the machine humming, and the electric lights hanging in the room all lit up. When we came out to see, this electricity was also generated by biogas as a power source. There was also a small engine connected to biogas next to the pond, which was driving a small steel mill to process wheat. After dinner, the residents chatted and strolled under the "biogas electric lights" by the pond.

　　Biogas Has Many Uses
　　We were so moved by the biogas-fueled beauty of the Dasi Residents Committee that we went to other places to see how the masses were using biogas. We saw people capturing biogas in ditches and ponds in many places; tinsmiths in the city were manufacturing various biogas lamps and biogas covers; restaurants on the street were stir-frying dishes with biogas; tea supply stations were burning tea with biogas; and we often saw people transporting biogas in biogas bags on bicycles or carrying them on their shoulders. In the countryside, we saw that many public canteens were also using biogas to cook. The First Production Team of Sanli Third Commune used biogas to cook for 225 people, and the Zhangzhuang Team of Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative used biogas to burn five large pots, supplying food for 460 people.

　　In Fuyang County, from cadres to the masses, everyone praised the benefits of biogasification. County Head Sun Yongxi said that Fuyang County is located in the plain area of ​​northern Anhui. There are no mountains or coal mines nearby. The fuel for burning every year is straw. It is very expensive to transport coal from far away, and transportation is difficult. However, if straw is used as fuel, it is difficult to feed livestock and accumulate fertilizer. After the whole county used biogas to cook, it could save 800 million catties of firewood every year. After kerosene for lighting was replaced by biogas lamps, more than 5 million catties could be saved every year. A comrade from the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative told us that the whole cooperative saved more than 80,000 yuan in firewood and lamp oil every year by using biogas for cooking and lighting. With just the money saved from these two items, 17 twenty-horsepower water pumps could be purchased in the first year, and five tractors could be purchased in the second year. The problems of irrigation, processing, and mechanized farming would be completely solved in two years. The benefits of saving firewood for feeding livestock and increasing fertilizer are not included in the calculation. Saving coal and wood for supplying steel smelting and running factories; saving labor and vehicles for transportation to do other production work, further highlights the importance of using biogas.

　　However, for women, the benefits of biogas are not limited to its economic value. Cao Guizhi from the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative said: "In the past, it took four people to cook in our Xiaodingzhuang public canteen, and they were still flustered. Just burning firewood to boil the pot required two people. If you didn't add it, the fire would go out. In the past, we got up at four o'clock in the morning to cook. Because the fire was not burning well, everyone couldn't eat until eight o'clock. But after using biogas to cook, only three people are needed. We can get up an hour later in the morning, connect the biogas pipe and light the fire, and you don't have to worry about it. We can leisurely fetch water, mix noodles, and stir-fry dishes. Everyone can eat by six or seven o'clock in the morning!" The working conditions of women in the kitchen show that biogasification has greatly improved women's working conditions.

　　After we personally saw how easy it was to obtain and generate electricity from biogas in Fuyang, we felt that the prospect of universally realizing biogasification in our rural areas was already in sight. (Attached photo)

    土办法创造着文明生活
    本报记者  于明  于风
    一到安徽省阜阳县，人们就能看到，在极平常的污水泥塘里，就能取出大量的沼气来点灯、烧饭、发电。
    在城关大寺居民第六食堂的前边，我们看到两个青年在塘里划着船游来游去。船的两边各带着三个倒扣在水里的木箱。青年一边划船，一边搅动水底的塘泥，只见船周围直冒气泡。阜阳县长孙永熙同志告诉我们，这就是在捕捉沼气了。他说，船两边挂的小箱子下面都没有底子，叫做“活动盖”，盖上有一个“输气管”。划船的人用竹竿在水下搅动塘泥，沼气上升，便被搜集到“活动盖”里了。
    一会儿活动盖里储满了沼气，（活动盖被沼气顶得越升越高），另一青年带来三个汽车内胎和一个水湿过的布口袋，他们把活动盖上的“输气管”连接上，两个人向下压盖子，沼气在几分钟内把车胎和口袋灌得臌臌的了。两个青年走出来，用火柴在车胎的气管子上一点，沼气立刻在管口燃烧起来。孙县长笑着说：“他们是在给你们表演哩！”他说，这里是一个沼气供应站，别的单位和群众要用沼气时，就用车胎、油布袋、甚至裤子来装，运到家里，点灯，煮饭，用不了还可储藏起来。
    看了捕捉和搬运沼气，孙县长和居民委员会的同志，热情地留我们在第六食堂喝“沼气茶”、吃“沼气饭”。因此，我们又有机会到厨房去参观。在厨房门口我们看到两口大水缸，水缸里盛满水，每个缸里都扣着像船上那样的“活动盖”。食堂的同志们告诉我们，这就叫储气缸，从塘里运来的沼气储藏在缸里，便随时可以利用。
    洁白的厨房
    我们走进厨房一看，啊！这个厨房真使人惊奇。顶棚糊的纸，灶台的石灰，和炊事员穿的罩裙，都是又白又净。地上除了刚刚拿进来的沼气袋外，什么柴草，煤炭都没有。房里只见有两口大锅灶，灶台上放了一个泥巴做的小炉子。炊事员把沼气袋上的皮管和芦苇秆连接，把苇秆插进泥巴小炉旁边的一个孔里，在土炉上边用火柴点燃，土炉炉膛里的许多细孔上就轰轰地着火了。坐在炉上的半锅冷水，只用四、五分钟就煮开来冲茶，于是我们喝上了“沼气茶”，炊事员把苇杆放到大锅灶的灶膛，又炒菜，又煮饭。炊事员不慌不忙，半小时工夫，就给我们吃上了“沼气饭”。我们特别对这个大锅灶感到兴趣，它上无出烟的烟囱，下无漏灰的火道。因为用沼气煮饭，既不用柴和煤炭，也就没有烟灰。烧沼气煮饭的简便，满屋里的白净，炊事员煮饭时劳动的轻松，使我们恍如置身于电气化的厨房。这真是用土办法就过上了文明的生活。据他们说，光是这个食堂，就有一百四十人已经过了几个月这样讲究的生活了。
    我们在吃晚饭时，忽听机器??地一响，一下房里挂的电灯都亮了。出来看时，这电也是用沼气作动力发出来的。塘边还有一个小引擎接上沼气，正带动小钢磨加工小麦。居民在饭后都在塘边的“沼气电灯”下闲谈、散步。
    沼气用处多
    我们被大寺居民委员会的沼气化美景所激动，便到其他地方去看看群众使用沼气的情形。我们看到许多地方的沟塘里也有人捕捉沼气；城里的白铁铺制造着各种各样的沼气灯、沼气盖；临街的饭馆在用沼气炒菜；茶水供应站在用沼气烧茶；路上不时地看到人们用自行车带着、用肩扛着沼气袋运送着沼气。我们在农村看到许多公共食堂也都用沼气烧饭。三里三社第一生产队，用沼气为二百二十五人煮饭，新华农业社张庄队用沼气烧五口大锅，供应着四百六十人吃饭。
    在阜阳县，从干部到群众，谈起沼气化的好处来，都是赞不绝口。孙永熙县长说，阜阳县地处淮北的平原地区，在它的附近既无山，又无煤，每年烧火的燃料，都用秸秆；从很远的地方运煤来，运价很贵，而且运输困难。但是，把秸秆作了燃料，喂牲口和积肥又很困难。全县都用沼气烧饭后，每年可节省八亿斤柴草，点灯用的煤油用沼气灯代替后，每年可节省五百多万斤。新华农业社一位同志告诉我们，全社用沼气做饭、点灯，每年节省的柴草和灯油值八万多元。只这两项的钱节省下来，第一年便可购买二十马力的抽水机十七部，第二年可购买拖拉机五部，二年即把灌溉、加工和机耕的问题全部解决了。至于节省的柴草喂牲口和增加肥料的好处，还没有计算在内。节省煤炭、木柴，供应炼钢铁、办工厂；节省搬运的劳动力和车辆，做其他的生产工作，就更显得利用沼气十分重要了。
    但是，对妇女来说，沼气的好处还不止于有经济价值。新华农业社的曹桂芝说：“我们小丁庄的公共食堂，过去四个人做饭，还慌得不行，光用柴草烧锅就要占两个人，你一把不添，火就熄了。过去早晨我们四点钟起来做饭，因火烧不好，到八点大家也吃不到饭。可是用沼气煮饭后，只要三个人，早晨晚了一个钟头起床，把沼气管接起来点着火，你就不要管它，挑水、和面、炒菜，消消停停，早晨六七点钟就都能吃饭了！”妇女们在厨房的工作情况说明，沼气化对妇女的劳动条件已大大的改善。
    我们在阜阳，亲眼看到沼气的取用和发电是这样容易以后，便感到我们农村普遍实现沼气化的远景已经在望了。（附图片）
