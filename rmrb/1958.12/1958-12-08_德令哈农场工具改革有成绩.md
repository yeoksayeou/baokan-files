    Delingha Farm Achieves Results in Tool Reform
    (Our dispatch) Xining, Qinghai – The workers and masses of the Delingha Farm in Qinghai Province, giving full play to their collective wisdom, have created and modified more than 20 large-scale agricultural tools during the technical reform movement. These tools have proven to be very effective in use, and it is estimated that they can save more than one-third of manpower and animal power.
    In the surging tide of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the workers of Delingha Farm, in order to improve tillage efficiency and quality and save manpower and animal power, made a series of reforms to agricultural tools used in plowing, tilling, sowing, ridging, loosening soil, deep plowing, ditching, and transportation. The lightweight double-furrow plow they created used a wooden frame, saving steel, and was easy to operate. Originally pulled by two mules, it can now be pulled by just one. The combined plow and harrow they created added two small disc harrows to the rear right side of the plow. When plowing, the soil is turned over and then immediately cut and crushed by the harrow discs, saving both manpower and animal power, and the quality is better than plowing and harrowing separately.

    德令哈农场工具改革有成绩
    本报讯  青海德令哈农场的职工群众发挥集体智慧，在技术改革中创制和改制了二十多件大型农具，这些农具经使用后效果很好，据计算可以节省人力和畜力三分之一以上。
    德令哈农场的职工在农业生产跃进声中，为了提高耕作效率和质量，节省人力和畜力，对耕地、碎土、播种、扶垅、松土、深翻以及开渠、运输等方面的农具做了一系列改革。他们创制的轻便双铧犁，是用木材做的犁架，节省了钢材，操作又轻便，原来用两头骡子拉，现在用一头骡子就能拉动。他们创制的带耙犁，在犁的后右侧增加了两片小圈盘耙，犁地时土壤翻转后，随即被耙片切碎，既节省人力、畜力，质量也比先翻后耙好。
