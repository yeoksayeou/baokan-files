    After Politics Takes Command, Technology is Key
    Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel First Camp Combines Soaring Enthusiasm with Technical Expertise
    Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant Sees Both People and Things, Output More Than Doubles
    (Our report) The Iron and Steel First Camp of the Qiaodong People's Commune in Shijiazhuang City, on the basis of a double bumper harvest of ideology and politics, launched a "Hall is Red" campaign, increasing the average daily output of pig iron by more than threefold. Indigenous blast furnaces have generally achieved high yields and long lifespans, saving manpower and reducing coke consumption by half. They have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest in indigenous furnace iron smelting and have been rated as a model unit in iron and steel production in the Shijiazhuang area.
    After criticizing "extensive planting with thin harvesting" and establishing the idea of "less planting with more harvesting," the leaders of the Iron and Steel First Camp closely focused on solving technical problems. Based on the production situation, the camp and company leaders summarized the specific operating experience of protecting wind tuyeres and measuring furnace temperatures in Furnace No. 17 to achieve high yields and long life. At the same time, they also summarized the experience of using less coke and more anthracite to produce the same amount of iron. Through on-site meetings, these experiences were disseminated to everyone, arming the workers technically. Thus, the "Hall is Red" campaign was launched in late November.
    The "Hall is Red" campaign is not just about completing the pig iron production plan, it is also about achieving a comprehensive leap forward in furnace longevity, low coal consumption, and low manpower use. Therefore, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, disclose the plan to the masses, mobilize the masses to discuss various production targets, and formulate specific measures to achieve the targets day by day, ten days by ten days, and furnace by furnace. The general targets discussed by everyone were that each furnace (newborn indigenous blast furnace) should produce more than two tons of iron per day for a good yield, more than three tons for a high yield; each ton of iron should consume less than three tons of coal for savings; the lifespan of the furnace should be seven days to pass, ten days for long life, half a month for high life, and so on. The workers on each furnace also formulated specific targets for daily output, material consumption, and manpower use based on different conditions. In this way, the camp comprehensively achieved the "Hall is Red" production targets in late November. Using twenty-eight indigenous blast furnaces, they produced 524 tons of iron in ten days, 3.34 times higher than in early November, and exceeded the iron production plan. The average daily output rose from the past ten tons to forty-two tons, and the coke consumption per ton of iron also decreased from an average of more than four tons to 2.02 tons, saving more than 500 tons of coke in ten days. The manpower required per ton of iron also decreased from 66 people in early November to 20 people. The lifespan of the indigenous blast furnaces also increased from two to three days to more than eight days. In December, the completion of various targets was even better, with more than 140 tons of iron produced on the 3rd alone, exceeding the daily plan by more than 50%.
    (Our report) Recently, under the premise of politics taking command, the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant has actively mobilized the masses to study technology, and the production of each workshop has generally more than doubled. Thirty-nine production teams have increased their daily output of freight cars from eighteen to one hundred.
    In the movement to produce 100 freight cars per day, the factory, guided by communist education and driven by the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's Industrial Political Work Conference, vigorously publicized the important significance of producing 100 freight cars per day. On this basis, they mobilized the masses to find key technical problems in production and solve them one by one. The workers expressed their determination to the Party Committee: We will not give up until we achieve the daily production of 100 freight cars! According to statistics from only three workshops, more than 7,400 suggestions for technical innovation were put forward in less than twenty days, and more than 2,300 of them have already been implemented. The shearing and punching team of the freight car workshop, through thirty-one technical innovations such as converting drilling machines to punching machines, widening the shovel blade of air shovels, and automatically feeding shearing machines, increased the daily output of freight cars from 39 to 175. In the movement, leaders at all levels went to the front line to command and fight, and adopted the method of mobilizing the masses to conduct extensive debates to solve major key problems. They also organized a three-way combination of leaders, workers, and technicians to jointly revise designs, conduct joint experiments, and jointly manufacture.
    In order to meet the equipment needed for the daily production of 100 freight cars, a large-scale upsurge in the creation of simple machine tools has been formed throughout the factory. In just twenty days, 167 simple machine tools of various types have been built.

    政治挂帅后  技术是关键
    石家庄钢铁一营冲天干劲和钻研技术相结合
    齐齐哈尔车辆厂见人又见物产量猛增一倍多
    本报讯  石家庄市桥东公社钢铁第一营，在思想政治双庆丰收的基础上开展了满堂红运动，生铁日产量平均提高三倍多，土高炉普遍达到丰产高寿，节省了人力，焦炭消耗也减少一半。获得了土炉炼铁的全面大丰收，被评为石家庄地区钢铁生产的模范单位。
    他们在批判了“广种薄收”，树立了“少种多收”的思想后，钢铁第一营的领导上又紧紧抓住解决技术问题。营、连领导上，根据生产情况，总结了十七号炉保护风眼、测定炉温达到高产高寿的具体操作经验，同时还总结了少使焦、多用白煤同样多产铁的经验。通过现场会，把这些经验传播给每个人，从技术上把工人们武装起来。于是“满堂红”运动就在11月下旬展开了。
    “满堂红”运动，不单单是为了完成生铁产量计划，它还要作到炉长寿、煤耗低、用人少的全面大跃进，因此，必须充分发动群众，依靠群众，把计划向群众交底，发动群众讨论各项生产指标，并逐日、逐旬、逐炉的订出实现指标的具体措施。大家讨论的总的指标是，每个炉子（新生式土高炉）日产铁两吨以上为丰产，三吨以上为高产；每吨铁耗炭三吨以下为节约，炉子的寿命七天为及格，十天为长寿，半月为高寿，等等。每个炉子上的工人，还根据不同的条件，订出具体的日产量、材料消耗、使用人工等指标。这样，这个营在11月下旬全面实现了生产指标达到“满堂红”，他们用二十八个土高炉，十天产铁五百二十四吨，比11月上旬提高三点三四倍，超额完成产铁计划。日产量由过去的十吨平均上升到四十二吨，每吨铁的焦炭消耗量，也由四吨多平均降低到二点零二吨，十天节约焦炭五百多吨。每吨铁需要的人工，也由11月上旬的六十六人降低到二十人。土高炉的寿命也由二至三天增到八天以上。进入12月份各种指标完成的更好，3日一天即产铁一百四十多吨，超额50％多完成日计划。
    本报讯  齐齐哈尔车辆厂最近在政治挂帅的前提下，积极发动群众钻研技术，各车间生产普遍翻了一番以上，有三十九个生产小组由日产货车十八辆提高到一百辆。
    这个厂在日产百辆货车运动中，以共产主义教育为纲，以贯彻省委工业政治工作会议精神为动力，大张旗鼓地宣传日产百辆货车的重要意义，并在此基础上发动群众，寻找生产中的技术关键问题，各个击破。工人们纷纷向党委表示：不实现日产百辆货车不罢休！仅据三个车间统计，不到二十天的时间就提出七千四百多项技术革新建议，并已实现了两千三百多项。货车车间剪冲组，通过将钻床改冲床、风铲加宽铲刃、剪机自动上料等三十一项技术革新，货车日产量由三十九辆提高到一百七十五辆的水平。在运动中各级领导干部也都亲赴前线边指挥边作战，针对重大关键问题，采取发动群众大鸣大放大辩论的方法，加以解决。并组织领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合，共同修改设计，共同试验，共同制造。
    为了满足日产百辆货车所需要的设备，全厂已形成了大造简易机床的热潮。仅二十天时间，就已造出各种简易机床一百六十七台。
