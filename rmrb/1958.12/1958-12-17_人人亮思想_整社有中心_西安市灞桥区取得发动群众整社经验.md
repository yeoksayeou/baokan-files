According to the Shaanxi Daily, by having commune cadres first conduct self-criticism, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, eliminate the masses' concerns, and start with the issues that the masses care about most, launching "airing of views" in the fields, Baqiao District in the suburbs of Xi'an City has initially formed a new situation of "everyone shines their thoughts, everyone speaks their views, and big-character posters are widely used" in the movement to rectify the people's communes, and has gained experience on how to mobilize the masses for airing of views and debates in the initial stage.

**Understanding the Masses' Thoughts**
**So the Leadership Has a Clear Picture**

At the beginning of the rectification movement, when the communes in Baqiao District mobilized the masses to air their views on the current problems of the communes, most of the masses were unwilling to speak, and some were even unwilling to participate in the "airing of views" meetings. Even if they did speak, they only talked about small problems. After further understanding, it was found that the masses had many concerns about this movement, with so-called "five fears": fear of affecting production, fear that opinions would not be effective, fear of retaliation from cadres, fear of offending people, etc. After analyzing these ideological problems, the communes and work teams believed that these problems, on the one hand, reflected that the masses did not have enough understanding of the significance and purpose of the rectification and communist education, and had deviations in their understanding of the nature of the "airing of views" and debates; but on the other hand, they also reflected the shortcomings in past work and the shortcomings in the work style of cadres, which deepened the masses' concerns. For example, some people only emphasized completing tasks in their work and rarely reasoned with people; some comrades, in the past, when presiding over debates, used simple methods, and sometimes turned the debates into struggle sessions; some cadres did not patiently educate and help people with serious shortcomings to solve specific difficulties, and often used the method of deducting work points as "punishment"; the untimely or incomplete handling of problems left over from last year's rectification and the opinions raised by the masses on a daily basis also caused resentment among the masses. These problems show that carrying out rectification at present is an urgent task, and the emergence of the masses' "five fears" shows that it is even more necessary to mobilize the masses to air their views on a large scale in the rectification.

**Explaining the Meaning of "Debate"**
**Eliminating Commune Members' Concerns**

After clarifying these viewpoints, the leaders of the communes in Baqiao District immediately organized a propaganda army to explain the necessity and great significance of carrying out communist education and rectifying the people's communes in the new situation of communization by using the lessons of the "saddle shape" and the promotion effect of the national rectification campaign on the Great Leap Forward last year, in order to eliminate the masses' concerns about affecting production. They also repeatedly explained to the masses that debate and struggle are two different things. Debate is a method of self-education within the people and a weapon for promoting democracy. Debates can only calmly present facts and reason, and are not allowed to arbitrarily label people. The purpose of the debate is to clarify confused ideas, raise awareness, and achieve a unified view, not to criticize people. It was pointed out that the simple methods and blunt attitudes of some people in past debates were shortcomings that should be corrected. In this way, the masses dared to speak boldly at the meetings.

**Cadres Consciously Conduct Self-Criticism**
**Inspiring Commune Members to Air Their Views**

At the same time, the communes also strengthened ideological education for cadres, affirming that their achievements in their work were the main thing, pointing out their shortcomings, and inspiring them to consciously conduct self-criticism at mass meetings and mobilize the masses to air their views on a large scale. After the Baimiao company commander of the Red Star People's Commune underwent branch education, he reviewed his impatience at a mass meeting and proposed that he must humbly accept the criticism of the masses and correct his shortcomings. Wang Zhongmin, who was originally afraid of retaliation, posted sixteen big-character posters in two days, and the opinions aired by the commune members also increased from more than one hundred to more than four hundred. After the second platoon leader of Shangqiaozikou reviewed to the masses that during the autumn harvest and autumn planting, his platoon had surplus livestock but did not support other platoons, which affected the timely completion of the task of the whole company, more than 30 people immediately raised criticisms, and some people also examined their own shortcomings.

**Starting with the Issues that the Masses Care About Most**

When the masses initially dispelled their concerns and made criticisms and suggestions on all aspects of the commune in thousands of big-character posters, this posed a new problem for the leaders of the communes: where to start to deal with these aired opinions and problems, and continue to consolidate and promote the upsurge of the masses' airing of views? In this regard, the Red Star People's Commune seized on starting with the issues that the masses cared about most at present to further expand the airing of views. When the airing of views of all commune members was approaching a climax, the leadership found that almost more than half of the opinions aired by the commune members were concentrated on current production and collective life and welfare. They criticized the chaotic situation of labor allocation in production at that time and raised the question of whether labor was really tight; they criticized that the collective canteens in the brigades did not have dining halls, it was inconvenient to queue up for meals, and that they ate cold meals and sometimes were not full. The commune party committee realized from analyzing these aired opinions that production and collective life and welfare issues had become the most important things that the masses cared about at that time. If they did not start with these most urgent problems in a timely manner, it would not only affect the mood of the masses' airing of views, but also affect the production of the entire commune. Therefore, they first launched a debate on labor issues among the commune members. On the basis of refuting the "theory of labor shortage," they put forward several specific methods to solve the problem of labor shortage, such as merging canteens to streamline personnel; promoting women replacing men and the elderly replacing the young in non-production departments; vigorously carrying out agricultural tool reforms; and setting up camps in the fields. As a result, a production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction was quickly set off throughout the commune. When the masses posted big-character posters praising this, they said: "Big-character posters are all over the streets and alleys, airing of views and debates set off a climax, communism shines brightly, and the enthusiasm of commune members soars to the sky." Next, the commune party committee proposed to all cadres and commune members to solve and rectify the problems of collective canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens in a concentrated manner, and sent a member of the party committee to test the rectification of a collective canteen in the Baimiao brigade and held a broadcast learning meeting in the whole commune. The commune women's federation specially tested the establishment of a kindergarten organization in the Huokou brigade and promoted it in the whole commune. In just half a month, the whole commune relied on its own strength to ensure that all canteens had dining halls, and also separated large and small stoves (small stoves were specially for the elderly and children), and selected fixed cooks and managers; in addition to solving all the houses and equipment for nurseries, kindergartens, and other organizations, it also trained nannies. Because the current problems that the masses cared about most were solved, the masses completely dispelled their original concerns about their opinions not being effective, and more actively participated in the movement to rectify the commune, once again pushing the airing of views to a climax.

**Where Production Goes**
**Airing of Views Goes**

After the masses had been mobilized through propaganda and practical actions, it became very important to take more effective measures to facilitate the masses' airing of views. At that time, some places in Baqiao District put forward the slogan "Where production goes, airing of views goes," and moved the big-character poster gardens and blackboard newspapers to the construction sites and fields, which quickly set off an upsurge of airing of views and achieved greater results. For example, cadres of the Rocket Battalion of the North Mang Water Conservancy Corps of the Hongguang People's Commune inspired the masses to air their views in production, and 91 commune members put forward a total of 750 opinions. The communes summarized this method and believed that the method of airing views in the fields was both lively and the masses could speak freely without affecting production, so they comprehensively promoted this method.

In addition to the above methods, some communes also put forward the "three no restrictions" airing of views slogan, which means no restrictions on content, no restrictions on time, and no restrictions on location. Individual connections were made with the elderly and patients, and groups for writing big-character posters on behalf of others were organized. As a result, a mass airing of views movement of "everyone shines their thoughts, everyone speaks their views, and big-character posters are widely used" quickly appeared in various communes. According to incomplete statistics, more than 24,900 big-character posters were posted and more than 57,000 opinions were put forward in the whole district in half a month. More than 90% of adults in all strata expressed their inner thoughts in various ways. These opinions involved all aspects of the commune, such as distribution issues, system issues, production management, life and welfare, and cadre work style. There were criticisms, as well as praise and suggestions; there were exposures of general problems, as well as reports of corruption and sabotage activities by the "five categories of elements." The exposure of these problems enabled the communes to understand the basics of ideology, life, organization, and systems, laying a favorable foundation for carrying out ideological education and rectifying various organizations of the commune in the next step.

    人人亮思想  整社有中心
    西安市灞桥区取得发动群众整社经验
    据陕西日报消息  公社干部首先进行自我批评，虚心听取群众意见，消除群众顾虑，从群众最关心的问题入手，在地头田间开展鸣放，使西安市郊灞桥区整顿人民公社运动，初步形成了一个“人人亮思想，个个讲看法，大搞大字报”的新局面，获得了初期如何发动群众鸣放辩论的经验。
    摸清群众思想
    领导心里亮堂
    灞桥区各公社在整社运动开始，发动群众就公社当前存在问题进行鸣放时，大部分群众都不愿发言，有人还不愿参加鸣放会议，就是鸣放也只是谈一些小问题。经过进一步了解，发现群众对这次运动顾虑很多，有所谓怕影响生产，怕提意见不顶事，怕干部打击报复，怕得罪人等“五怕”。各公社和工作组对这些思想问题经过一番分析后，认为这些问题，一方面反映了群众对整社和共产主义教育的意义和目的了解不够，对鸣放辩论的性质认识上有偏差；但另一方面也反映了过去工作中的毛病和干部作风上的缺点，加深了群众的顾虑。例如；有些人在工作中光强调完成任务，说理较少；有些同志过去在主持辩论会时，由于方式方法简单，有时把辩论会变成了斗争会；有的干部对缺点比较严重的人，不耐心进行教育和帮助他们解决具体困难，动不动就用扣工分办法予以“惩罚”；对去年整社中遗留的问题和群众日常提出的意见，处理不及时或不彻底，也引起群众反感。这些问题，说明目前进行整社，更是一件刻不容缓的工作，而群众“五怕”思想的产生，又说明在整社中更需要发动群众大鸣大放。
    讲清“辩论”意义
    消除社员顾虑
    灞桥区各社领导上在明确这些观点后，就立即组织一支宣传大军，通过“马鞍形”的教训，和去年全民整风对今年大跃进所起的推动作用，说明在公社化的新形势下，开展共产主义教育整顿人民公社的必要性和重大意义，来消除群众怕影响生产的顾虑。并向群众反复讲明辩论和斗争是性质不同的两回事情，辩论是人民内部进行自我教育的方法，是发扬民主的武器。辩论只能平心静气地摆事实、讲道理，不允许给人乱扣帽子。辩论的目的是为了澄清混乱思想，提高觉悟，取得一致看法，并不是整人。指出有些人过去在辩论会上方式简单、态度生硬，那是缺点，应该纠正的道理。这样群众就敢于大胆在会上发言了。
    社干自觉检查
    启发社员鸣放
    同时各社也加强了对干部的思想教育，肯定他们工作中的成绩是主要的，指出他们的缺点，启发他们自觉地在群众会上进行自我检查，发动群众大鸣大放。红星人民公社白庙连连长经过支部教育，在群众会上检讨了自己的急躁情绪，并提出一定要虚心接受群众批评、改正缺点后。原来怕打击报复的王中民在两天内就贴了十六张大字报，社员们鸣放的意见，也由一百多条增加到四百多条。上桥梓口第二排排长向群众检讨自己在秋收秋播中，本排有多余牲口，不去支援其他排，结果影响全连未按时完成任务的本位主义缺点后，当场即有三十多人提出批评，有的人还检查了自己的缺点。
    从群众最关心
    的问题入手
    当群众初步解除顾虑，以千万张大字报对公社各个方面提出批评、建议的时候，这对各社的领导上又提出了一个新问题：究竟从哪里入手来对待这些鸣放出的意见和问题，继续巩固和推动群众鸣放的热潮？在这方面，红星人民公社抓住了从群众当前最关心的问题入手，进一步展开鸣放。当全公社社员鸣放接近高潮时，领导上发现在社员鸣放的意见中，几乎多半都集中在当前生产和集体生活福利方面。他们批评当时生产中劳力调配的混乱情况，提出了劳力究竟紧张不紧张的问题；批评各连队集体食堂没饭厅，吃饭排队不方便，以及吃冷饭和有时吃不饱的现象。公社党委从分析这些鸣放意见中，体会到生产和集体生活福利问题，已成为当时群众最关心的大事情，如果不及时从这些最紧迫的问题入手，不但会影响群众鸣放的情绪，也会影响全社的生产。于是，首先发动社员开展了一场有关劳力问题的辩论，在驳倒“劳力紧张论”的基础上，提出了具体解决劳力不足的几项办法，如合并食堂精简人员；在非生产部门推行以女代男、以老代少；大力开展农具改革；在田间扎营盘等。结果很快就在全社掀起了一个以兴修水利为中心的生产高潮。群众贴大字报歌唱这件事时说：“满街满巷大字报，鸣放辩论掀高潮，共产主义放红光，社员干劲冲云霄”。接着，公社党委又向全体干部和社员提出突击解决和整顿集体食堂、托儿所和幼儿园的问题，派出党委委员在白庙连试办整顿了一个集体食堂，在全社举行广播学习大会。社妇联在豁口连专门试办了一个幼儿园组织，在全社进行推广。全社只半月的时间，就依靠自己的力量，使所有食堂都有了饭厅，并且还分别了大、小灶（小灶专供养老人、小孩），选拔固定了炊事员和管理员；对托儿所、幼儿园等组织，除解决全部房屋和设备外，并培养训练了保育员。因为解决了当前群众最关心的问题，这就使群众彻底打消了原来怕提意见不顶事的顾虑，更加积极的参加了整顿公社的运动，又一次把鸣放推向了高潮。
    生产到哪里
    鸣放到哪里
    经过宣传和实际行动，把群众已经发动起来后，如何采取更有效的措施，便利群众鸣放，就显得十分重要。当时灞桥区有的地方提出“生产到哪里，鸣放到哪里”的口号，把大字报园地、黑板报搬到了工地和田间，很快就掀起了鸣放高潮，收效较大。如红光人民公社北蟒水利兵团火箭营干部在生产中启发群众鸣放，九十一名社员共提出意见七百五十条。各社对这种方法进行了总结，认为地头鸣放的方法，既生动活泼，群众发言无拘无束，也不影响生产，于是全面推广了这种方法。
    除以上方法外，有的社还提出不限内容，不限时间，不限地点的“三不限”鸣放口号，对老年人和病人进行了个别串连，并组织了代写大字报组，这样就很快在各社出现了“人人亮思想，个个讲看法，大搞大字报”的群众鸣放运动。据不完全统计，全区在半个月内，就贴出大字报二万四千九百多张，提出意见五万七千多件，各阶层90％以上的成年人通过各种方式说了自己的心里话。这些意见涉及到公社的分配问题，体制问题，生产管理，生活福利，干部作风等各个方面。既有批评，也有表扬和建议；既有一般问题的揭发，也有对贪污行为和五类分子造谣破坏活动的检举。这些问题的暴露，使各公社摸清了思想、生活、组织和制度的底子，为下一步开展思想教育，整顿公社各项组织，打下了有利的基础。
