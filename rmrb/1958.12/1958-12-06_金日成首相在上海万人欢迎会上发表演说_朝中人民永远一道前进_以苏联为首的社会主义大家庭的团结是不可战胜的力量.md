Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th December. Over ten thousand people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand rally this afternoon at the Cultural Square to warmly welcome Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests of the Korean government delegation he led. Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a passionate and lengthy speech at the meeting. He praised the friendship forged in blood between the peoples of China and Korea, saying that there is no friendship more beautiful and no unity more powerful! The Korean people will always advance together with the Chinese people.

The Cultural Square was solemnly and beautifully decorated today. Huge banners reading "Welcome the Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Headed by Premier Kim Il-sung," "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship," and "Long Live the Unity of the Socialist Camp Headed by the Soviet Union" were hung around the venue. The national flags of China and Korea were hung high on the rostrum, and blooming flowers and evergreen pines and cypresses were placed there, symbolizing the unbreakable fighting friendship between China and Korea that will last forever. Enthusiastic Shanghai citizens flocked to the venue from all directions hours in advance. Labor models wore their glittering medals, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army wore neat uniforms. People repeatedly sang "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" at the venue.

At four o'clock sharp, Premier Kim Il-sung and members of the Korean government delegation, including Park Jung-ae, Nam Il, Kim Kwang-hyup, Lee Il-kyung, and Lee Young-ho, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Mayor Xu Jianguo, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the band played a welcome tune, women waved colorful scarves, and Young Pioneers waved their red scarves. The entire audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time to welcome the distinguished guests.

Also seated on the rostrum with the distinguished guests were Cao Diqiu and Wei Wenbo, Secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Vice Mayors Liu Shuzhou, Jin Zhonghua, Rong Yiren, and Sheng Pihua; Lieutenant General Wang Bicheng, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District of the People's Liberation Army; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan; and Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang.

Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a speech amidst a storm of applause. The Premier first conveyed the warm, fraternal greetings of the Korean people to all the citizens of Shanghai. The Premier said: "The people of Shanghai, like the people of all China, are comrades-in-arms who have forged a friendship with the Korean people in blood, and are brothers who are closely united with the Korean people. During the Fatherland Liberation War of Korea, the people of Shanghai held high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, and gave valuable assistance to the Korean people in both material and spiritual terms. Many people from Shanghai participated in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and aided us with their blood." "In the post-war period, the people of Shanghai provided us with various mechanical equipment and daily necessities needed for economic recovery and development and our socialist construction, and are still continuing to assist us. In the happy life of our people today, the blood and sweat of the entire Chinese people, including the blood and sweat of the people of Shanghai, is infused. These are all manifestations of the boundless love of the Chinese people for the Korean people. It further strengthens the traditional friendship and solidarity between our two peoples."

When Premier Kim Il-sung expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the people of Shanghai in the name of the Korean people, the shouts of "Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People" resounded throughout the venue for a long time.

Premier Kim Il-sung warmly praised China's great leap forward in socialist construction. The Premier emphasized: "Anyone who ignores the power of socialist China and dares to take risks will suffer an irreparable defeat."

The Premier strongly condemned the American aggressors for occupying China's indivisible territory—Taiwan—and engaging in provocative acts of interference in China's internal affairs and opposition to China. The Premier said: "This provocative behavior by the United States has aroused great anger among the Chinese people. We have seen the soaring spirit of the entire Chinese people to thoroughly crush all provocative acts of U.S. imperialism, and we have seen the firm will of the Chinese people to liberate their indivisible territory of Taiwan. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will overcome all obstacles and liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands."

Talking about the peaceful construction of Korea, the Premier said: "The Korean people, advancing shoulder to shoulder with the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, have made great achievements in the cause of socialist construction."

Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out: "The U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against South Korea hinders the peaceful reunification of our country and threatens peace in the Far East." The Premier emphasized: "The entire Korean people resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops' occupation of South Korea and resolutely demand that the U.S. military immediately get out of South Korea. Peace-loving people all over the world unanimously condemn the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops' occupation of South Korea."

The Premier said: "The U.S. imperialists cannot stop the growing revolutionary strength of the Korean people. The socialist strength in the northern half of our country will surely grow stronger day by day, which will give the South Korean people a powerful revolutionary influence. In South Korea, the patriotic and democratic forces opposing U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang will become stronger." "The Korean people will strengthen internationalist solidarity and their own revolutionary forces to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and will firmly defend the eastern outpost of peace and socialism."

The Premier pointed out that the peoples of Korea and China are comrades-in-arms who share life and death and go through thick and thin together. Today, the peoples of the two countries are closely cooperating and victoriously building socialism. "This kind of friendship and solidarity can only arise among people who are closely united with common ideas and common goals in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. There is no friendship more beautiful than this! There is no unity more powerful than this!"

The Premier concluded: "For us, Sino-Korean friendship is the most precious. Therefore, in order to further consolidate this friendship, the Korean people will do everything in their power to advance together with the Chinese people forever."

At the end of his speech, Premier Kim Il-sung shouted in Chinese: "Long live the infinite prosperity of the great Chinese people!" "Long live the friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples cemented in blood!" "Long live the invincible unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long live lasting world peace!"

Premier Kim Il-sung's speech was constantly interrupted by the slogans and cheers of the masses. When the Premier shouted friendship slogans in Chinese, the entire audience once again stood up, the women once again waved their scarves, and the Young Pioneers waved their red scarves. The venue was filled with jubilation, and the music of "Socialism is Good" and the cheers of friendship reverberated throughout the venue for a long time. The young women of Shanghai presented bouquets of flowers to Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests.

At the beginning of the meeting, the band played the national anthems of Korea and China. Vice Mayor Xu Jianguo delivered a welcome speech, expressing his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the people of Shanghai to Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests for visiting Shanghai. He said: "We, the people of Shanghai, feel unparalleled honor and joy to have the opportunity to receive the government delegation of our great heroic neighbor Korea, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung."

Xu Jianguo said: "The people of our country have an incomparably deep friendship with the Korean people. China and Korea are as interdependent as lips and teeth, share weal and woe, are as close as brothers, and are closely related. In the three-year war against American aggression and aid to Korea, the people of China and Korea fought side by side, writing the most magnificent chapter in human history."

Xu Jianguo said: "Under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party, and with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, the heroic Korean people defeated the war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism in Korea. This victory defended the independence and freedom of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and also ensured the security of China and the socialist construction cause of the Chinese people. We all know that in the Northern Expedition in our country, on the road of the 25,000-li Long March, in the difficult years of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and during the Liberation War, outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people once fought together with us in bloody battles and aided the Chinese revolution and the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. This flesh-and-blood friendship, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and cemented in blood, is the noblest in the world. We, the people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, express our heartfelt gratitude for this internationalist spirit of the Korean people."

Xu Jianguo then said: "The heroic and indomitable, simple and hardworking, diligent and humble, selfless labor of the heroic Korean people in the struggle against aggression and in socialist construction will always be a model for us to learn from." He said: "We, the people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, are concerned at every moment about every achievement of the heroic Korean people in the cause of socialist construction. We regard the achievements of the Korean people in construction as our own achievements, just as we regard every victory of the fraternal Korean people in the war against aggression as our own victory. We fully believe that the heroic Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and Premier Kim Il-sung, will surely achieve new and greater victories in the cause of socialist construction!"

In his speech, Xu Jianguo denounced the aggressive, insane U.S. imperialism and its running dogs for continuing to create tension, occupying the southern territory of Korea and our country's territory of Taiwan, and threatening the bandit acts of peace in Asia and the world. He said: "The American paper tiger, which has been pierced by the heroic Chinese and Korean people, cannot scare anyone." "The three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea must be unified; our Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu must be liberated! Let us always unite together and fight against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and defend peace in the Far East and the world."

Today, those who also participated in the welcoming rally were heads of Shanghai's party and government organs, democratic parties and people's organizations.

After the warm and grand welcoming rally, the Premier and distinguished guests watched the welcoming performances of the Shanghai People's Acrobatic Troupe and the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater with the welcoming masses. When the Premier once again entered the venue, thunderous applause and cheers resounded in the venue again. After the performance, the distinguished guests presented flower baskets to the actors. Premier Kim Il-sung, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Mayor Xu Jianguo, went to the stage and met with the actors. (Attached picture)

    朝中人民永远一道前进
    以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的团结是不可战胜的力量
    新华社上海5日电  上海市各界人民一万多人今天下午在文化广场举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎金日成首相和他率领的朝鲜政府代表团的贵宾们。金日成首相在会上发表了热情洋溢的长篇演说。他颂扬了中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊，他说，再也没有比这种友谊更加美好，再也没有比这种团结更加有力！朝鲜人民将永远同中国人民一道前进。
    文化广场今天布置得庄严美丽，会场四周悬挂着“欢迎以金日成首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团”、“中朝友谊万岁”、“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁”的巨幅标语。主席台上高悬着中朝两国国旗，放置着盛开的鲜花和常青的松柏，象征着中朝两国牢不可破的战斗友谊万古长存。热情的上海市民几小时以前就从四面八方涌向会场，劳动模范佩着金光闪闪的奖章，解放军官兵穿着整齐的军服，人们在会场上一遍又一遍地高唱着“金日成将军之歌”。
    四时正，金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团团员朴正爱、南日、金光侠、李一卿、李永镐等同志，由陈毅副总理、许建国副市长陪同登上主席台。这时，乐队奏起欢迎曲，妇女们挥舞着彩色头巾，少先队员挥动红领巾，全场起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌欢迎贵宾。
    陪同贵宾在主席台上就座的，还有中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋、魏文伯，副市长刘述周、金仲华、荣毅仁、盛丕华，解放军上海警备区司令员王必成中将，外交部副部长曾涌泉，中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光等。
    金日成首相在暴风雨般的掌声中发表演说。首相首先向全体上海市民转达了朝鲜人民的热烈的兄弟般的问候。首相说：“上海人民和全中国人民一样，是同朝鲜人民以鲜血结成的战友，是同朝鲜人民亲密团结的兄弟。在朝鲜的祖国解放战争时期，上海人民高举抗美援朝的旗帜，在物质上和精神上给予了朝鲜人民以宝贵的援助。上海市有很多人参加了中国人民志愿军，用鲜血援助了我们。”“在战后时期，上海人民又供给我们在经济恢复发展和我国社会主义建设中所需要的各种机械设备和生活必需品，而且现在还在继续援助我们。在今天我国人民的幸福生活里，浸透着全中国人民的血汗，也浸透着上海市人民的血汗。这些都是中国人民对朝鲜人民无限热爱的表现。它进一步加强了我们两国人民的传统友谊团结。”
    当金日成首相以朝鲜人民的名义向上海人民表示衷心感谢的时候，会场上“中朝人民的友谊万岁”的欢呼声经久不息。
    金日成首相热情地颂扬了中国的社会主义建设大跃进。首相强调指出：“谁要忽视社会主义中国的威力，胆敢冒险，那么，谁就要遭到不可挽救的失败。”
    首相强烈谴责了美国侵略者侵占着中国不可分割的领土——台湾，进行着干涉中国内政和反对中国的挑衅行为。首相说：“美国的这种挑衅行为引起了中国人民极大的愤怒。我们看到了全中国人民要彻底粉碎美帝国主义的一切挑衅行为的冲天气概，我们看到了中国人民要解放自己不可分割的领土台湾的坚强意志。我们坚信，中国人民一定会克服一切障碍，解放台湾和沿海岛屿。”
    谈到朝鲜的和平建设时，首相说：“同以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民并肩前进的朝鲜人民，在社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就。”
    金日成首相指出：“美帝国主义对南朝鲜的侵略政策，阻碍我们祖国的和平统一，并且威胁远东的和平。”首相强调地说：“全朝鲜人民坚决反对美帝国主义侵略军队强占南朝鲜，并且坚决要求美军立即滚出南朝鲜去。全世界爱好和平人民一致地谴责美帝国主义侵略军队强占南朝鲜。”
    首相说：“美帝国主义者决不能阻挡朝鲜人民日益增长的革命力量。我国北半部的社会主义力量，一定会一天比一天地增强，这将给予南朝鲜人民以有力的革命影响。在南朝鲜，反对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的爱国的民主力量，将会更加强大。”“朝鲜人民将以加强国际主义团结和自己的革命力量来实现祖国的和平统一，并将牢固地保卫和平和社会主义的东方前哨。”
    首相指出，朝中两国人民是同生死、共患难的战友，今天两国人民又紧密合作，胜利地建设着社会主义，“这种友谊和团结，是只能在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中，以共同的思想和共同的目标紧密团结起来的人民之间才能产生的。再也没有比这种友谊更加美好的！再也没有比这种团结更加有力的！”
    首相最后说：“对我们来说，朝中友谊是最宝贵的，因此，朝鲜人民为了更加巩固这种友谊，将竭尽自己的一切力量，永远同中国人民一道前进。”
    金日成首相在演说的最后，用中国话高呼：“伟大的中国人民的无限繁荣万岁！”“朝中两国人民以鲜血凝结成的友谊、团结万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的统一、团结万岁！”“世界持久和平万岁！”
    金日成首相的讲话，不断为群众的口号声、欢呼声打断。在首相用中国话高呼友谊口号的时候，全场再一次起立，妇女们再一次挥舞起头巾，少先队员挥动着红领巾，会场上万众欢腾，“社会主义好”的乐曲和友谊的欢呼声，长久振荡着会场，上海的女青年们把一束束鲜花献给金日成首相和朝鲜贵宾们。
    大会开始的时候，乐队高奏朝中两国国歌。许建国副市长致欢迎词，他代表上海人民对金日成首相和朝鲜贵宾们访问上海，表示衷心的感谢。他说：“我们上海人民有机会接待伟大的英雄邻邦以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团，感到无上的光荣和喜悦。”
    许建国说：“我国人民与朝鲜人民有着无比深厚的友谊，中朝两国唇齿相依、安危与共、亲如手足、休戚相关。在历时三年的反抗美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争中，中、朝两国人民并肩作战，写下了人类历史上最壮丽的诗篇。”
    许建国说：“英雄的朝鲜人民，在金日成首相和朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，击败了美帝国主义在朝鲜发动的侵略战争。这一胜利，捍卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立和自由，也保障了中国的安全和中国人民的社会主义建设事业。我们都知道，远在我国的北伐战争中，在两万五千里长征的道路上，在八年抗日战争的艰苦年月里，在解放战争时期，朝鲜人民优秀的儿女，曾经和我们一起浴血战斗，援助中国革命和中国人民解放事业。建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，用鲜血凝结成的这种血肉友谊，世界上没有比这更为高贵的了，我们上海人民和全国人民一样，对于朝鲜人民的这种国际主义精神表示衷心的感谢”。
    许建国接着说：“英雄的朝鲜人民在反抗侵略和进行社会主义建设的斗争中，英勇顽强、艰苦朴素、勤劳谦逊、忘我劳动的高贵品质，永远是我们学习的榜样。”他说：“我们上海人民和全国人民一样，每时每刻都关切着英雄的朝鲜人民在社会主义建设事业中的每一项成就。我们把朝鲜人民的建设成就，看成是我们自己的成就，正像我们把兄弟朝鲜人民在反侵略战争中的每一个胜利，都看成是我们自己的胜利一样。我们完全相信，英雄的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和金日成首相的领导下一定能够在社会主义建设事业中获得新的更伟大的胜利！”
    许建国在讲话中斥责了侵略成性、丧心病狂的美帝国主义及其走狗，继续制造紧张局势，霸占朝鲜南部国土和我国领土台湾，威胁亚洲和世界和平的强盗行为。他说：“被英勇的中朝人民戳穿了的美国纸老虎，是吓不倒任何人的。”“朝鲜的三千里江山一定要统一；我国的台、澎、金、马一定要解放！让我们永远团结在一起，为反对美帝国主义的侵略和保卫远东和世界和平而斗争。”
    今天，参加欢迎大会的还有上海市的党和政府机关、民主党派和人民团体的负责人。
    热烈、隆重的欢迎大会结束以后，首相和贵宾们与欢迎群众一起观看了上海人民杂技团和上海京剧院的欢迎演出。当首相再一次走进会场的时候，会场里又响起了雷动的掌声和欢呼声。演出结束后，贵宾们向演员们赠送了花篮，金日成首相并由陈毅副总理和许建国副市长陪同登上舞台和演员们会见。（附图片）
