I.
	Autumn in Anguo, a competition in farming,
	Average yield per mu surpasses five thousand.
	Barren soil deeply turned, three or more feet,
	Base fertilizer layered, ten or more times applied;
	Popularizing sparse planting, abundant harvest system,
	Vigorously cultivating intensive farming fields.
	Imagining the bountiful harvest day next spring,
	Golden waves surging, a sky of roaring billows.

II.
	East Wind Commune, a contest of heroes,
	Pioneering the peak of garden-style farming.
	Thousands of mu forming large squares,
	Ten thousand rows woven into curtain-like fences;
	The land as flat as a mirror, a human ingenuity,
	The soil as fine as sand, a universal creation.
	Well-drilling never sleeps, water abundant,
	Drought demon disappears, years of abundance.

III.
	One mountain competes to be higher than the next,
	Ten thousand horses gallop to plant banners.
	Just seeing the East Wind blow across the land,
	Then seeing the Great Dipper shine in the sky;
	Pioneer with vigor, Jiao Village calls,
	Unparalleled in the world, Fengbo beckons.
	Glad indeed today in Anguo County,
	Communes vying to launch satellite tides.
	[Note] The Wurenqiao East Wind People's Commune manages a thousand mu of land, hailed as "The First Field Under Heaven"; The Jiaozhuang Pioneer People's Commune manages ten thousand mu of land, hailed as "Champion Square"; The Fengbo People's Commune manages twenty thousand mu of land, hailed as "Unparalleled Field in the World."

IV.
	October's long sky, sleepless nights,
	High lamps illuminating the fields.
	Skyward enthusiasm soaring to the heavens,
	Earth-shaking songs resonating with pipes and strings;
	Ambitious to transform poverty,
	Heroic hearts vying for Zuti's whip.
	Labor has always been called bitter,
	Today's joy, how could it be accidental!

    安国赞

    一
    秋来安国竞经畋，亩产平均夺五千。
    瘠土深翻三数尺，底肥层复十来遍；
    风行少种多收制，大搞精耕细作田。
    想见明春丰熟日，金涛云涌浪滔天。
    二
    东风社里赛英雄，首创园田高级峰。
    千亩成方连大片，万条罗织出帘拢；
    地平似镜人间巧，土细如沙宇宙工。
    机井不眠水量足，魃君潜迹岁年丰。
    三
    一山竞比一山高，万马齐奔树锦标。
    才见东风吹满地，又看魁斗耀重霄；
    先锋有劲焦庄唤，盖世无双奉伯招。
    且喜今朝安国县，社社争放卫星潮。
    〔注〕五仁桥东风人民公社，经营千亩土地，号称“天下第一田”；焦庄先锋人民公社，经营万亩土地，号称“魁元方”；奉伯人民公社，经营二万亩土地，号称“盖世无双田”。
    四
    十月长空夜不眠，高灯明烛满田燃。
    朝天干劲冲霄汉，卷地歌声闹管弦；
    壮志力图穷白改，雄心争着祖生鞭。
    从来劳动都称苦，今日欢娱岂偶然！
