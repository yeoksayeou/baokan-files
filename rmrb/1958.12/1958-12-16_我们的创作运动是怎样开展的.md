    How Our Creative Movement Was Launched
    Shanghai Maritime Administration Sun Min

    "The life of a sailor is too monotonous, it's either work or sleep. The propaganda work is old-fashioned, and there's no cultural life to be seen." This was a big-character poster that the sailors pasted to our Propaganda Department during the rectification movement. There were hundreds of similar big-character posters criticizing us for not paying attention to the sailors' cultural life. Some said, "Our production is booming, but our rest is bleak!" Others said, "Eight or nine years after the liberation of the motherland, we still haven't seen any literary works about sailors." The masses' accusations were reasonable. In the past, although we had done some work in this area and the leadership had collaborated with professional writers, we had not achieved any success. In 1956, a writer came from afar, preparing to write about the life and struggle of sailors; but after staying for more than two months and strolling along the Bund a few times, he went back without writing anything. So why didn't we mobilize the masses to write themselves? Mainly because the ideological superstitions had not been broken at that time, and we lacked confidence in relying on the masses. Therefore, in our actual work, we focused on key creations and neglected mass creations. We only made general arrangements and appeals for mass creation activities, but lacked concrete help and supervision. In fact, if mass creation is not mobilized, key creations cannot proceed smoothly. For example, when writing the movie script "Maritime Giant Dragon," we felt that there was insufficient material to express the ideological state and spiritual outlook of the sailors during the Great Leap Forward. These problems cannot be solved by relying on a few people engaged in key creations to go around in circles in the office or take a cursory look at the production site. Moreover, this has also led to incorrect views among the masses about literary and artistic creation. When they saw a few people who liked literary and artistic creation, they would sarcastically say, "Want to be a writer?" or "Want to show off?" making the few who liked writing afraid to write. If the masses are not mobilized, the literary and artistic creation power hidden in the masses cannot be tapped. One sailor submitted manuscripts to "Literary Monthly" for four years, and we didn't even know about it. These facts show that without fully mobilizing the masses and mobilizing all creative forces, it is impossible to cultivate a large number of literary and artistic fighters among the sailors, and it is impossible to reflect the new people, new things, and new outlook in the Great Leap Forward of the maritime transportation industry in a timely manner.

    After discovering the above problems, the Party committee immediately conducted repeated studies and decided to vigorously mobilize the masses to launch a creative upsurge before the end of the year. The slogan was "Launch ten thousand creations, write good works, welcome the New Year, and welcome the tenth anniversary." According to this instruction, the Party Committee Propaganda Department did a preliminary investigation and organized the mass literary and artistic creation forces. The masses were very enthusiastic and expressed their willingness to express their wishes in literary and artistic forms. For example, the Party branch of the Democratic No. 13 ship originally only planned to write one hundred articles, but after mobilization, the masses proposed to write four hundred articles. In less than two days, nearly fifty poems were written. Some old sailors, stokers, and cooks wrote several articles during their rest period. The 160 people in the Sailors' Hospital wrote a large number of poems, cartoons, storytelling, clapper talks, novels, movie scripts, etc. Lu Qingsen, a 52-year-old from the Passenger Transportation Section, proposed to create twelve articles. Mao Xingcai, an engineer of worker origin, compiled a seven-character poem. If he couldn't write it himself, he asked comrades who could write to write it for him. Many Communist Youth League branches on ships launched and organized youth creation groups and launched friendly competitions with brother ships. A mass literary and artistic creation activity has already set off an upsurge!

    In order to develop and consolidate the mass movement, special leadership groups and various mass literary and artistic creation groups were established with the branch as the unit. The works written by the masses were guaranteed to be implemented, such as being published in the form of wall newspapers, creation lists, and literary leap forward stage journals within the scope of the branch, and selected good quality ones were sent to the Bureau Newspaper (Maritime Transport Newspaper) for publication. After careful selection, they were sent to municipal newspapers and periodicals for publication, which greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for creation. In order to ensure quality, we adopted the method of closely combining key creation and mass creation, adopting division of labor and contracting, backbones leading the masses, and key points leading the general, that is, the Party committee grasping the key points, the branch grasping the general, and paying attention to cultivating and discovering key points in the general. We believe that this can not only ensure quantity and quality, but also conforms to the principle of popularization and improvement. The Party Committee originally proposed four key creation projects, but now it has discovered good themes from the masses and listed them as eleven key projects, which provides us with a reliable foundation for completing the creative tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    Through the mass literary and artistic creation activities in the short twenty days, we have received a great education. From this, we realize that in this great era of "one day equals twenty years," many unprecedented miracles have appeared, which cannot be written by a few professional writers or a few backbones who love literary and artistic creation without fully mobilizing the masses. We also realize that after the laboring people have undergone a great transformation politically and economically, they will inevitably generate new and urgent demands in literature and art. If the correct demands of the masses are not met, it will seriously affect the laboring people's full political enthusiasm and soaring energy in production. Under the leadership of the Party, we should resolutely implement the Party's literary and artistic creation policy, break superstitions, believe in the masses, and organize the mass literary and artistic creation teams!

    我们的创作运动是怎样开展的
    上海海运管理局  孙敏
    “海员生活太单调，不是工作就睡觉，宣传工作老一套，文艺生活见不到”，这是海员们在整风运动中向我们宣传部贴的一张大字报。类似这样的大字报，批评我们不重视海员文艺生活，有好几百张。有的说：“我们生产热热轰轰，休息时冷冷清清！”有的说：“祖国解放八、九年了，还没有看到写海员的文艺作品。”群众的责难是有道理的。过去我们虽然在这方面作过一些工作，领导上也与专业作家协作过；但是却没有做出什么成绩来。1956年有一位作家从远道而来，准备写海员的生活和斗争；但是住了两个多月，逛了几次黄浦江畔以后，却什么东西都没写就回去了。那么为什么我们没有发动群众自己来写呢？主要由于当时思想迷信还没破除，对于依靠群众缺乏信心，不相信群众。因此，在实际工作中，偏重于重点创作，忽视了群众创作，对于群众创作活动，只作一般布置和号召，却缺乏具体帮助和督促。其实群众创作如果没有动起来，重点创作也不可能顺利进行。如写“海上巨龙”这个电影剧本时，在表现海员在大跃进中的思想状况和精神面貌的变化方面，就感到材料不足。这些如不依靠群众来补充，光凭少数几个搞重点创作的人在办公室打圈圈或到生产现场去走马看花，是解决不了问题的。而且这样一来，也使群众对文艺创作产生了不正确的看法。他们见到少数爱好文艺创作的人就讽刺说：“想当作家呀”或“想出风头”等，使少数爱好写作的人也不敢动笔了。群众没有发动起来，蕴藏在群众中的文艺创作力量也不可能被发掘出来。有一个船员向“文艺月报”投了四年之久的稿，我们都还不知道。这些事实表明，不充分发动群众，不把一切创作力量调动起来，要在海员中培养出大批文艺战士，要及时地把海运事业大跃进中的新人新事新面貌，反映出来，那是不可能的。
    发觉上述问题以后，党委立即进行反复研究，决定在年底前大力发动群众掀起创作热潮，口号是“开展万篇创作，写出好作品来，迎接元旦，迎接十周年”。党委宣传部根据这一指示，做了摸底排队工作，把群众文艺创作力量组织起来。群众热情很高，纷纷表示愿意将自己的愿望用文艺形式表达出来。如民主十三号轮党支部，本来只订了一百篇创作规划，动员后群众却提出要写四百篇，不到两天功夫，就写出了近五十篇的诗歌；有些老水手、生火工、厨工在休息期中连写了几篇；海员医院一百六十人写了大量诗歌、漫画、说唱、快板、小说、电影剧本等。客运科五十二岁的陆庆森提出要创作十二篇，工人出身的毛兴才工程师，编成了七言诗，自己不会写就请会写的同志代笔。许多船上的共青团支部发动与组织青年创作组，与兄弟船展开了友谊竞赛。群众性的文艺创作活动已经掀起热潮了！
    为了发展和巩固群众运动，以支部为单位建立了专门领导小组和各种群众文艺创作小组。仅是群众写出来的作品做到篇篇有着落，如在支部范围内统一以墙报、创作榜、文艺跃进台刊登出来，从中选送质量好的交局报（海运报）发表，再经过精选送市级报刊发表，大大鼓舞了群众创作积极性。为了保证质量，采取了重点创作和群众创作紧密结合、采取分工包干、骨干带群众、重点带一般的办法，即党委抓重点，支部抓一般，在一般中又注意培养和发现重点。我们认为这样做既能保证量多质好，又是符合普及与提高的原则。党委原提出重点创作四个项目，现从群众中发现好的题材列为重点的就有十一个项目，使我们在完成党所交给我们的创作任务上有了可靠的基础。
    通过短短二十天来的群众大搞文艺创作的活动，我们受到很大的教育。从中我们认识到在这“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代里，许多今古未闻的奇迹出现了，不充分发动群众，靠少数专业作家或少数爱好文艺创作骨干是写不出来的；我们也体会到，劳动人民在政治上经济上大翻身后，必然会在文学艺术方面产生新的迫切的要求，如果不满足群众的正确要求，将严重地影响到劳动人民饱满的政治热情和生产上的冲天干劲。我们应该在党的领导下，坚决贯彻党的文艺创作方针，破除迷信，相信群众，把群众文艺创作队伍组织起来！
