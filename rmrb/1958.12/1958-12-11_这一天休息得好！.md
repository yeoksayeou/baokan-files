    A Good Day of Rest!
    Wentang
    November 24th was a day of rest for the Guancheng Brigade of the Wudongzha People's Commune in Cixi. Today, people were going to have a happy holiday.

    Thanks to the heavens, we had a sunny and breezy day. Guancheng Town, where the brigade is located, was a festive scene. The young couple Tang Yinshan and his wife were playing with little Ada. Little Ada used to be very naughty, but today he was back, singing and dancing. When guests came in, he called them "Uncle," as if he had become a different person. When the little guy struggled to sing "There are many friends in kindergarten, let's dance and sing songs" with his not-so-clear articulation, his parents beamed with joy and "mobilized" the baby to sing a song "Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye to grandma's house." The two of them had just returned from the fields more than ten miles away yesterday. They had been living there for more than a week, working with peace of mind. The nanny took good care of the child, keeping him clean, lively, and polite. Today, the parents were free from all household chores, and they were going to have fun with their baby.

    Dad carried little Ada to the street. The streets today had several times more people than usual. Everywhere there were red and green slogans, and the street blackboard newspaper called on the commune members to have a happy day of rest. The advertisement for the ball game attracted passers-by. The shop assistants were extremely busy. Yu Guanhong and his mother went into the cloth department together, picking and choosing, and bought a floral quilt cover, a white quilt lining, and several pairs of cloth shoe uppers. These were things that Yu Guanhong was preparing for his wedding, and nothing could be careless.

    The cultural station was cleaned up neatly and tidily today, and it opened its doors early in the morning to welcome people. Readers eager for knowledge and people who love chess and ball games soon filled the seats. "Old customer" Qiu Defu was reading attentively. After reading the newspaper, he read pictorials, not at all disturbed by the noise. The reports of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, and the humorous cartoons, captured his heart. Several little guys were engrossed in playing carom billiards. When they played, they closed their mouths and squinted their eyes. Their naive expressions were really funny. The storytelling house was full of guests. Today's program was "Water Margin." Mr. Chen Yaosheng's measured tone and vivid expressions made those "Wu Song fans" and "Li Kui fans" who admired the Liangshan heroes completely mesmerized.

    "Commune members, come and have a happy meal!" As soon as the earthen loudspeaker sounded, crowds from all directions flowed to the canteen. The cooks of the Fourteenth Canteen caught lively fresh fish by moonlight yesterday and slaughtered a big fat pig. Today, large plates and bowls of braised pork, fried silver carp, roasted taro milk, fried tofu, and vegetable tofu soup were spread all over the table. These dishes were already very rich, and the store also sold wine and side dishes. Yue Dakuan, who had been a farmhand for thirty years in the old society, bought a bottle of white wine and ten liang of old wine, added two plates of side dishes, and had a hearty drink to his heart's content. Chen Changfu's family of nine, four generations, gathered together and enjoyed this rich meal with satisfaction. (Attached picture)

    这一天休息得好！
    文堂
    11月24日，是慈溪五洞闸人民公社观城大队的休息日，今天人们要过一个快乐的假日。
    多谢老天帮忙，送来了一个风和日丽的天气。大队所在地的观城镇，一片节日景象。年青的汤银善夫妻俩，正在逗着小阿达玩耍。小阿达过去顶是淘气了，今天回来，一会儿唱歌，一会儿跳舞，客人进来叫叔叔，好像变了另一个人。当小家伙用他那不十分清楚的口齿，吃力地唱着“幼儿班里朋友多，跳跳舞来唱唱歌”时，爸爸妈妈乐开了怀，又“动员”宝宝唱了一支“摇呀摇，摇到外婆家”。他们俩昨天才从十几里外的田间归来。他们住在那儿已经一个多星期了，劳动得十分安心。阿姨把孩子管教得清洁、活泼，又懂礼貌。今天回来，爸爸妈妈没有了一切家务事的牵累，他们要尽情地和宝宝一起玩玩。
    爸爸抱着小阿达到了街上。今天的街头，人增加了几倍。街头巷尾，尽是红红绿绿的标语，街头黑板报号召社员快乐地过一个休息日，球赛的广告吸引住了行人。商店的营业员忙得不亦乐乎。俞管宏和妈妈一起走进了布匹部，左挑挑，右拣拣，买了一床花被面，一床白被里，还有几双布鞋面。这是俞管宏准备结婚用的东西，一点不能马虎。
    今天的文化站收拾得干干净净整整齐齐，一清早就开门等待着来人。渴望知识的读者和爱好棋类球类的人们，一会儿就占满了位置。“老顾客”裘德福静心地在阅读。读完了报纸他又看画报，丝毫不为喧哗声所动。祖国大跃进的报道，和幽默风趣的漫画，捉住了他的心。几个小家伙沉醉在打康乐球的娱乐中，打起球来闭着嘴巴，斜着眼睛，那副天真的神情，真叫人好笑。说书场里高朋满座。今天的节目是水浒传，陈尧生老先生缓急有节的音调，维妙维肖的表情，使那些敬佩梁山英雄的“武松迷”、“李逵迷”着了魔。
    “社员同志们，来快乐地会餐吧！”土广播刚刚响过，四面八方的人群又向食堂流去。十四食堂的炊事员，昨天带着月光捕来了活蹦乱跳的鲜鱼，杀了一口大肥猪。今天，大盘大碗的红烧肉、煎白鲢鱼、烧芋奶、油豆腐、青菜豆腐汤摆满了一桌。这些菜本来已经十分丰富了，小卖部另外还出售酒和小菜。旧社会当了三十年长工的岳大宽，今天买了一瓶白酒、十两老酒，加添了两盘小菜，开怀畅饮了个痛快。陈长福一家九口四代人，团团地围在一起，心满意足地享用了这丰盛的一餐。（附图片）
