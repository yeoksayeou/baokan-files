    Wooden Sailboats Tow Bamboo Rafts
    (Reported by this newspaper) Tunxi Port in Anhui Province is one of the main ports for the collection and transportation of Mao bamboo in the mountainous areas of southern Anhui. Due to the rapid increase in the volume of metallurgical materials transported, by the end of October, the port had a backlog of 100,000 Mao bamboo that could not be shipped out. To solve this problem, Wu Linli, an employee of the port, after several studies, finally successfully tested a method of using wooden sailboats to tow bamboo rafts by leveraging the flow rate of the water level. The first batch of twenty-nine wooden sailboats, in addition to being fully loaded with materials, each towed twenty-five sections of bamboo rafts, and also used the buoyancy of the bamboo rafts to load another 7,500 jin of tree materials on the rafts. In one trip, a total of more than 18,000 Mao bamboo (weighing 453 tons) and more than 100 tons of wood were transported. (Sha Kaizhu)

    木帆船拖带毛竹排
    本报讯  安徽省屯溪港是皖南山区毛竹集运地的主要港口之一。由于冶炼物资运量的急骤增长，到10月底该港积压了十万多棵毛竹无法运出。为了解决这个问题，该港职工吴林仂经数次研究，终于试验成功了用木帆船借水位的流速拖带毛竹排的方法。第一批二十九艘木帆船除本船载满物资外，每艘船后面拖带二十五节毛竹排，同时还借竹排的漂浮力，在排上又装载了七千五百市斤树料。一次计拖运出毛竹一万八千多棵（重四百五十三吨）和一百多吨木料。（沙开铸）
