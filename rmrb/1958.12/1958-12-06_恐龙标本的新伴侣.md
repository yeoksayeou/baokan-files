　　New Companions for Dinosaur Specimens
　　Lu Ying

    In the museum in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, there will soon be two new exhibits – statues of two British generals. The Sudanese people are no strangers to them, because the statues of these two leaders of British rule in Sudan, Gordon and Kitchener, have stood in the squares of their capital for many years.

    But now these statues are to be moved from the conspicuous and revered squares to the museum, to be displayed alongside other "historical relics" for people to admire. This shows that in Sudan, as in other parts of Asia and Africa, historic changes are taking place. The Sudanese people, like other countries that have won national independence, are beginning to remove the traces of colonial shame.

    British colonialists ruled Sudan for more than half a century, almost two generations. They rode roughshod over the Sudanese people, sucking their blood and sweat to fatten themselves. But instead of being grateful to the people who fattened them, these colonial masters demanded that the oppressed and enslaved people be grateful to them, and even erected statues after their deaths for people to worship. However, the statues of British generals erected in Khartoum, like the statues erected by colonialists in other countries, stood there day and night, tirelessly serving as negative examples for the oppressed people, reminding them forever that colonialists were shameful plunderers and executioners! The people's hatred was gathering and growing!

    What the Sudanese people will never forget is the blood debt that Kitchener incurred when he invaded Khartoum in 1898, when he used the blood of the Sudanese people to dye the waters of the Nile red! The Sudanese people can also never forget Gordon, who massacred them with bloody means.

    The Sudanese people feel indignant and full of national pride when they see the statues of the colonialists! It was the Sudanese patriots who killed the British General Gordon in the famous battle to liberate the capital Khartoum in 1885 - his hands were not only stained with the blood of the Sudanese people, but also with the blood of the Chinese people, as he served as an executioner for the Qing Dynasty emperor in suppressing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising!

    We Chinese people once rejoiced in the victory of the Sudanese people, because, although our two countries are far apart, in the last century, we confronted a common enemy on different battlefields. Gordon, this British executioner, had tasted the iron fist of our Chinese insurgent peasants and slipped away, but finally could not escape the just judgment of the Sudanese people. In the fight against the common enemy, the final victory belonged to the Sudanese people, to the Chinese people, not to the British colonialists!

    Isn't that so? Our Shanghai once had a so-called "Gordon Road," but where is it now? Khartoum once had a "Gordon Square," but where is it now? These traces of colonial shame have been permanently removed from Chinese soil, and are being removed from Sudanese soil.

    Isn't that so? The Chinese people stood up first, and then the Sudanese people stood up, and many insulted and harmed people stood up. Where the British flag once flew in the squares of Khartoum, the flag of national independence and freedom now flies!

    The era of colonialists riding roughshod over the people is gone forever. Colonialists have not only lost those statues in Sudan and other places where they once lorded it over, but today, throughout Asia and Africa, there are waves of people demanding independence and freedom, waves that will uproot the cancer of colonialism from the earth.

    The course of history has determined that the colonial system will be cleared away forever like garbage. The fate of the colonialists, like those statues that have been toppled, will be sent to the historical museum to be companions with dinosaur specimens. There, they will continue to serve as the best negative examples, and they will still stand motionless in the display cases to tell people: Colonialism was once a shameful plunderer and executioner, but the people have triumphed!

    恐龙标本的新伴侣

    在苏丹首都喀土穆的博物馆里，不久将有两件新展品——两个英国将军的雕像。苏丹人民对它们一点也不陌生，因为这两个雕像，英国统治苏丹的两个头子戈登和基切讷的雕像，站在他们首都的广场上已经有不少岁月了。
    但是，而今这些雕像却要从众目聚视、为人尊崇的广场上搬到博物馆里，同另外一些“史迹”并列，供人欣赏了。这说明在苏丹，正如在亚洲和非洲大陆上的其他地方一样，正在发生着历史性的变化。苏丹人民，也和其它争取到民族独立的国家一样，在着手清除殖民主义的耻辱的痕迹。
    英国殖民者统治苏丹达半个世纪多，差不多有两代人的时间了。他们骑在苏丹人民头上作威作福，吮吸着苏丹人民的血汗，养肥了自己。但是，这些殖民老爷们不但不知道对养肥了他们的人民感恩戴德，相反的，却要那些被压迫被奴役的人民对他们感恩戴德，甚至在他们死后还要立下雕像，让人们来供奉。可是在喀土穆竖起的英国将军的雕像，也像殖民者在其它国家里竖起的雕像一样，日夜不休地站在那里给被压迫的人民充当反面教员，使人们永远记住殖民者是可耻的掠夺者和刽子手！人民的仇恨在聚集着，增涨着！
    苏丹人民永远不会忘记的是基切讷在1898年侵占喀土穆时所欠下的血债，是他用苏丹人民的鲜血染红了尼罗河的河水！苏丹人民也永远不能忘记用血腥手段屠杀他们的戈登。
    苏丹人民看到殖民者的雕像在义愤填膺之余，也充满了民族自豪感！是苏丹爱国者在1885年解放首都喀土穆的著名战役中击毙了那个英国将军戈登——他双手不仅沾满了苏丹人民的鲜血，也沾满了中国人民的鲜血，他曾充当过清朝皇帝镇压太平天国起义的刽子手！
    我们中国人民曾经为苏丹人民的胜利欢欣过，因为，我们两国虽然相距遥远，但是在上一个世纪里，我们就在不同的战场上对付过共同的敌人。戈登这个英国刽子手，曾尝到过我们中国起义农民的铁腕的锤击，而后溜走了，但是终于逃不脱苏丹人民的正义的裁判。在对付共同敌人的战斗中，最后胜利的是苏丹人民，是中国人民，而不是英国殖民者！
    难道不是这样吗？我们中国的上海！曾有过所谓“戈登路”，但它而今安在哉？喀土穆也曾有过“戈登广场”，但它而今又安在哉？这些殖民主义的耻辱的痕迹在中国土地上被永远清除了，在苏丹的土地上也正在被清除着。
    难道不是这样吗？中国人民先站起来了，后来苏丹人民也站起来了，许许多多被侮辱被损害的人们都站起来了。在喀土穆的广场上从前升起英国旗子的地方现在升起了民族独立和自由的旗帜！
    殖民者骑在人民头上作威作福的时代已经一去不复返了。殖民者不仅是在苏丹和其他作威作福过的地方失去了那些雕像，今天在亚洲和非洲大陆上，到处都激荡着人民要求独立自由的浪潮，这种浪潮要把殖民主义这个人类的毒瘤连根从地球上拔除掉。
    历史的进程已经断定：殖民制度必将像垃圾一样被永远清除出去。殖民主义者的下场也和那些被轰倒的雕像一样，将被送进历史博物馆同恐龙标本为伴。它们在那里，还要继续充当最好不过的反面教员，它们还是一动不动地站在展览橱里告诉人们：殖民主义曾经是可耻的掠夺者和刽子手，但是人民胜利了！（附图片）
