      Song of the Waiter
      Service work is for everyone
      Treat customers with diligence
      Customers eat well and leave satisfied
      Going to work, he also serves everyone
      Entering the canteen, joyously
      There's rice, dishes, and soup
      Leaving the canteen, chest held high
      Raising the red flag to the battlefield
    Beijing Jishilin Restaurant
            Diao Yongming, Wang Yuzhong

      服务员之歌
      服务工作为人人
      招待顾客要殷勤
      顾客吃好满意走
      上班他也为人人
      一进食堂喜洋洋
      又是饭菜又是汤
      出了食堂胸脯挺
      高举红旗上战场
    北京吉士林餐厅
            刁永明、王玉忠
