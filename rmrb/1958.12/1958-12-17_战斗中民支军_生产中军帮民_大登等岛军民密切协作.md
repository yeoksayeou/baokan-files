    以前，部队和岛上人民共同协商确定：在炮战中，以炮兵部队为主，步兵和人民全力支援；在海岛守备中，以步兵部队为主、炮兵和人民全力支援；在发展生产和进行建设当中，以岛上人民为主，炮兵和步兵全力支援。他们按岛上居民分布和部队驻防情况，采取军民分段、分片包干办法，互相支援。目前，驻岛部队正积极帮助公社进行生产，为实现公社到年底生产十万担盐和明年产量争取比今年更大跃进而努力。部队全部包下了扩大盐场面积的任务，现在每天都有一批官兵，到盐场进行义务劳动。在劳动中，炮手和步兵战士们都说：“在激烈炮战中，岛上人民全力支援我们，干得很好；现在我们支援他们发展生产，应当干得更好些。”此外，三个岛的部队还大力帮助公社积肥。某步兵营已积肥一百多担，交给了生产大队。
    驻岛步兵部队已帮助公社训练了两批男、女民兵，训练出许多重机枪、轻机枪、自动枪和骑枪等各种枪手，驻岛炮兵部队帮助公社训练了许多炮手。驻岛部队还专门帮助公社训练了若干高射机关枪手、通信兵和卫生兵。
