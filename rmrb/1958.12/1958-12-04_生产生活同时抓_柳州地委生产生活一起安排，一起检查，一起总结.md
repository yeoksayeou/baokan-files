Grasp Production and Life Simultaneously
	Liuzhou Prefectural Committee Arranges, Inspects, and Summarizes Production and Life Together
	According to a report in the Guangxi Daily, during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Party organizations at all levels in Liuzhou Prefecture not only grasped the leadership of production but also paid attention to improving the lives of the masses.
	Since the beginning of spring production this year in Liuzhou Prefecture, the burden on the rural labor force has increased significantly. Especially after August, when industrial production in various places gradually surged, the problem of improving the lives of the masses to ensure the upward development of production became more prominent. After discovering this problem, the Liuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly adopted the "three grasps" measures: ① When going to the countryside to inspect production, it is necessary to simultaneously inspect the problems in the lives of the masses; ② When holding meetings to study and deploy production, it is also necessary to simultaneously deploy and arrange the lives of the masses; ③ When summarizing and promoting production experience, it is also necessary to simultaneously summarize and promote good experiences in improving life. After the establishment of public canteens by the people's communes in various counties, in mid-September, the Prefectural Committee instructed all localities to focus on the work of the canteens, putting forward four requirements for running the canteens well: eating enough, eating well, saving, and hygiene. It also instructed the communes to send stronger backbone cadres to lead the canteens and establish a set of work systems for managing the canteens. The leading comrades of the Prefectural Committee paid attention to inspecting the commune canteens and the lives of the masses every time they went to the countryside to inspect work. At the same time, regarding the issue of "big collective, small freedom," the Prefectural Committee has emphasized it in several meetings and clarified the following provisions for the communes: ① Currently, public canteens should not merge several villages into one to facilitate the masses; ② Canteens should strive to have one table per household, or freely combined tables; members can bring their own side dishes, and meals can be delivered to the homes of the sick and weak; ③ Members are allowed to pickle their own side dishes, raise poultry, and add dishes privately during festivals; ④ Except for single-person households, villages should not be merged for the time being. In addition, regarding the issue of the masses' rest, it was specifically pointed out that the industrial and agricultural production army on the front line and in the rear should be guaranteed eight hours of sleep every day. The counties not only paid attention to the lives of the agricultural production masses in the rear but also paid attention to improving the lives of the masses on the steel front line, arranging the rest time of the steel warriors, and promptly sending living materials to the front.
	In implementing the leadership policy of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other," the county Party committees of various counties convened canteen work meetings to study the canteens and promote the experience of running the canteens well.
	Some Party committee secretaries also personally engaged in canteen "experimental plots," going deep into the canteens and proposing methods to improve the work of the canteens. Yang Shengqiu, the secretary of the Hongxing People's Commune Party Committee in Liujiang, went deep into the canteen, not only grasping political and ideological work but also grasping the management of the canteen, helping the canteen to implement the "six links" (i.e., taking the canteen as the core and attaching supply and marketing points, hot water rooms, washing and drying rooms, laundry rooms, sewing and mending rooms, and reception rooms), thereby greatly improving the lives of the members. The canteens of the communes throughout the prefecture have also improved greatly due to the strengthening of the leadership of the Party committees. Now, more than 170,000 mu of vegetables have been planted throughout the prefecture, and many canteens have also raised large fat pigs; generally, there are vegetables and soup, and the better ones have two dishes and one soup, with care taken for the elderly, weak, children, patients, and guests.
	The lives of the masses have improved, and their ideological awareness has been further enhanced, resulting in increased enthusiasm and the continuous emergence of new creations and new inventions. During the most intense steel production in October, "rear" agricultural production could also be done well at the same time. The field management and autumn harvest work in the later stage of late rice were closely grasped, especially the autumn harvest, which was carried out in a timely manner in various places, so that all the fruits of the harvest were returned to the barns.

    生产生活同时抓
    柳州地委生产生活一起安排，一起检查，一起总结
    据广西日报消息  在工农业生产大跃进中，柳州专区各级党组织不仅抓紧了生产的领导，也注意了群众生活的改善。
    柳州专区自今年春季生产开始以来，农村劳动力的负担就显著增加，特别是8月各地工业生产逐渐高涨以后，改善群众生活保证生产向上发展的问题就更加突出。中共柳州地委发现这个问题后，及时采取了“三抓”的措施：①下乡检查生产必须同时检查群众生活上的问题；②开会研究、布置生产时也必须同时布置和安排群众生活；③总结推广生产经验时也必须同时总结推广改善生活的好经验。各县人民公社建立公共食堂以后，9月中旬，地委又指示各地，要把食堂工作抓好，对办好食堂提出了四项要求：吃饱，吃好，节约，卫生。并且指示各公社要派较强的骨干去领导食堂，建立一套管理食堂的工作制度。地委领导同志每次下乡检查工作，都注意检查公社食堂和群众生活。同时，对“大集体小自由”问题，地委曾经在几次会议上强调过，并且对公社明确规定：①目前公共食堂不要几个屯合并为一个，以方便群众；②食堂应争取做到以一户为一桌，或自由结合编桌；社员可自带小菜，病弱的可送饭到家；③允许社员私人腌制小菜，饲养家禽，节日可以私人加菜，④除了独居户以外，村屯暂不合并。此外，对群众的休息问题，具体指出前方和后方的工农业生产大军，平时要保证每天有八小时的睡眠。各县不仅注意了后方农业生产群众的生活，也注意了改善钢铁前线群众的生活，安排钢铁战士的休息时间，及时把生活资料送上前方。
    各县县委在贯彻“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的领导方针中，都曾召开了食堂工作会议，研究食堂，推广办好食堂的工作经验。
    有些党委书记还亲自搞食堂“试验田”，深入食堂，提出改进食堂工作的办法。柳江红星人民公社党委书记杨胜求同志深入食堂，不但抓政治思想工作，还抓食堂的管理，帮助食堂实行了“六连环”（即以食堂为核心，附设供销点、热水房、洗晾房、洗衣室、缝补衣服室、招待室），从而使社员生活有了很大的改善。全专区各公社的食堂由于党委加强了领导，也都大有起色。现在全专区已种下蔬菜十七万多亩，不少食堂还养了大肥猪；一般的都作到了有菜有汤，较好的有二菜一汤，老弱、小孩、病人、来客有照顾。
    群众生活改善了，思想觉悟就更加提高，因而干劲日增，新创造、新发明不断出现。10月份钢铁生产最紧张时，“后方”农业生产也能同时作好，晚稻后期的田间管理和秋收工作都抓得很紧，尤其是秋收，各地都能及时进行，使丰收的果实全部还仓。
