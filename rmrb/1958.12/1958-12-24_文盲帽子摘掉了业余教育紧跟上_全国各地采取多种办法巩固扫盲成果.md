    Hats of Illiteracy Removed Spare-Time Education Follows
    Various Methods Adopted Across the Country to Consolidate Illiteracy Elimination Achievements
    (Our dispatch) To consolidate the achievements in eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, spare-time education for workers and peasants is being vigorously developed throughout the country. All levels and types of spare-time schools have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,160,000 spare-time primary and secondary schools, red-expert universities, and technical and cultural schools have been established across the country, with more than 50 million workers and peasants participating in learning.
    In areas where illiteracy has been basically eliminated, party and government leaders at all levels have promptly conducted inspections, evaluations, and summarized experiences. Recently, some provinces and cities have held meetings, issued instructions, and arranged work for this winter and next spring. From November 13th to 23rd, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee convened an education work conference, proposing to establish a large number of red-expert schools and organize literacy graduates to continue their studies, so that 80% of the literacy graduates will reach the cultural level of junior high school graduation within five years. Shandong Province issued a notice in early November to vigorously consolidate the achievements in eliminating illiteracy.
    Many places have simultaneously grasped spare-time education while engaging in large-scale steelmaking, deep plowing, and water conservancy construction, so that newly graduated literacy students can continue learning. Xinhe County, Hebei Province, from the county to the commune, unifies production and learning under the unified leadership of the Party, and uniformly arranges production and learning time. Pinghe County, Fujian Province, has also compiled supplementary teaching materials related to steelmaking, water conservancy construction, and road construction in conjunction with production.
    However, after basically completing the task of eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, some areas have developed complacency, some cultural studies have been interrupted, and some people who have just escaped illiteracy have experienced regression. For example, in early October, the Jining Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province conducted a sample survey of some communes, streets, and handicraft cooperatives in Jiaxiang, Jinxiang counties, and Jining City, and found that an average of 30.5% of the people failed. According to a survey of ten townships in Wuwei County, Gansu Province, the general return rate is about 30%. In October, the Fuyang Special District of Anhui Province found about 200,000 to 300,000 people relapsed into illiteracy, accounting for more than 10% of the total number of literacy graduates. This phenomenon has now attracted the attention of various places, and active measures are being taken to consolidate and improve.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 23rd) Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province (recently merged into Houma City), has taken various measures to organize literacy graduates to continue learning culture, consolidate and improve literacy achievements, and further improve the cultural level of the masses.
    In consolidating the achievements in eliminating illiteracy, Xinjiang County has universally carried out activities such as reviewing, practicing writing, reading, and reading newspapers. Leading cadres of the county party committee designed a practice book and distributed it to each literacy graduate, including items such as practicing new characters, explaining words and sentences, connecting words to make sentences, recording work points, writing diaries, and writing stories, with a total of 19,000 words. This practice method meets the needs of students of different levels and adapts to the characteristics of busy production, so that students can use all fragmented time to practice writing anytime and anywhere. Many students filled their practice books in a short time. Many people in various townships and communes carry mobile schoolbags and cultural bags with them, learning wherever they go. This has enhanced the writing and reading skills of the majority of students, and their political level has also been improved.
    The literacy graduates in this county also adopted the method of "learning in use, improving in use" to consolidate the achievements in eliminating illiteracy. They wrote letters, wrote challenge letters, formulated production plans, recorded work points, wrote and sang their own songs, and wrote articles for small newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and radio stations. Nanzhang Village universally implemented the practice of students recording their own work points. During the rectification campaign, many students wrote big-character posters themselves. They said with satisfaction: This is really doing their own things themselves, learning culture and managing their families well.
    Xinjiang County can enable the masses to consolidate their learning achievements and improve their cultural level in a short period of time, also because it has adopted learning organizational forms that adapt to the characteristics of production, uniformly arranged learning time, and organized the participation of a large number of intellectuals in teaching. Various townships and communes have established learning organizations according to the production organization, learning wherever production goes. Since September, various townships and communes have also established 202 red-expert schools and many spare-time senior primary classes. The courses include politics, cotton and grain cultivation, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, industrial machinery, and basic knowledge of social sciences. These schools have compiled 78 kinds of new textbooks. The county party committee summarized the advantages of these textbooks and compiled a set of four-in-one textbooks on language, politics, technology, and natural science. The writing style is diverse, the content is easy to understand, and it is combined with the actual situation of rural production and the characteristics of farmers' lives. At the same time, the old arithmetic textbooks were reformed, the repeated and cumbersome review questions were compressed, and typical exercises combined with production were added. According to this set of new textbooks, students can complete the senior primary school course in just half a year.

### 文盲帽子摘掉了业余教育紧跟上  全国各地采取多种办法巩固扫盲成果

    文盲帽子摘掉了  业余教育紧跟上 
    全国各地采取多种办法巩固扫盲成果
    本报讯  为了巩固扫除青壮年文盲的成果，全国各地正在大力发展工农群众业余教育。各级各类业余学校如雨后春笋，据不完全统计，全国共办起业余中、小学、红专大学、技术文化学校等一百一十六万余所，五千多万工农群众参加了学习。
    基本扫除文盲的地区，各地党政领导及时地进行了检查、评比、总结经验等工作。最近有些省市召开会议，发出指示，布置今冬明春的工作。甘肃省委11月13日至23日召开了教育工作会议，提出要大办红专学校，组织脱盲学员继续学习，五年内使脱盲学员中80％的人达到初中毕业的文化程度。山东省在11月初发出通知，大力巩固扫盲成果。
    许多地方，在大炼钢铁、深耕土地及兴修水利等工作中，同时抓业余教育，使刚毕业的扫盲学员继续学习。河北省新河县从县到社使生产和学习由党统一领导，统一安排生产和学习时间。福建省平和县还结合生产编写了炼钢铁、修水利、筑公路等补充教材。
    但是，有些地区在基本上完成扫除青壮年文盲任务以后，产生了松劲思想，有的文化学习中断了，并有部分刚摆脱文盲状态的人发生回生复盲现象。如山东省济宁专署在10月上旬对嘉祥、金乡县和济宁市抽查一部分公社、街道、手工业社，平均有30.5％的人不及格。甘肃省武威县据十个乡的调查，一般回生率在30％左右。安徽阜阳专区10月份检查复盲的人数约有二、三十万，占扫盲毕业总数的10％以上。这种现象目前已引起各地注意，正在采取积极措施巩固提高。
    新华社太原23日电  山西省新绛县（最近已并入侯马市）采取各种措施，组织扫盲毕业学员继续学习文化，巩固和提高扫盲成绩，使广大群众的文化程度有了进一步的提高。
    新绛县在巩固扫盲成果中，普遍开展了复习、练写、读书、看报等活动。县委领导干部设计了一种练习本，发给扫盲毕业学员人手一册，内容包括练习生字、讲解词句、联词造句、记工账、记日记、写话等项目，共可写一万九千字。这种练习方法满足了学员不同程度的要求，适应了生产忙的特点，使学员可以利用一切零散时间随时随地练写。许多学员在短时间就把练习本写得满满的。各乡社许多人随身携带流动书包和文化袋，走到那里，学到那里。这样使广大学员的书写和阅读能力增强了，政治水平也有了提高。
    这个县的扫盲毕业学员还采取“学中用，用中提高”的办法，巩固扫盲成果。他们自己写信，写挑战书，订生产计划，记工账，自编自唱，给小报、黑板报、广播站写稿。南张村普遍实行了学员自己记工。整风时，许多学员自己动手写大字报。他们满意地说：这才是自己的事自己办，学好文化当好家。
    新绛县能使群众在短期间巩固学习成果，提高文化水平，还由于采取了适应生产特点的学习组织形式，统一安排了学习时间和组织广大知识分子参加教学工作。各乡社按照生产组织建立了学习组织，生产到那里，学习到那里。从9月份起，各乡社又办起了二百零二座红专学校和许多业余高小班。课程有政治、棉粮栽培、畜牧兽医、工业机械和社会科学基础知识等。这些学校编写出新教材七十八种，县委综合这些教材的优点，又编了一套语文、政治、技术、自然科学的四合一课本。编写体裁多种多样，内容通俗易懂，并且结合了农村生产实际和农民生活特点。与此同时，还改革了算术旧教材，压缩了重复繁多的复习题，增加了结合生产的典型习题。根据这套新教材，学员只需半年时间就可学完高小课程。
