    Everyone Handles Matters Concerning Everyone
    In order to further implement democratic management, the Party Committee and Management Committee of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Hejian County, Hebei Province, recently mobilized commune members to freely air their views and suggestions on current production, life, and the work style of cadres. In addition to using forms such as big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and discussion meetings, commune and team cadres also went deep into the masses to collect opinions. The township Party committee and the commune management committee studied each opinion expressed by the masses, summarized and sorted them out, put forward preliminary handling opinions, and submitted them to the commune member representative assembly for discussion. They seriously dealt with them, ensuring that every item was accounted for and every matter was resolved. For example, commune members raised the issue that so much money was made from selling cotton this year, but wages were not paid, and they did not know what the money was used for. The commune management committee then announced the accounts of the two months since the establishment of the commune, so that everyone knew the income and expenditure of the commune, and in accordance with the requirements of the commune members, the first wage was issued in advance, which the masses were very satisfied with. For other major issues, such as distribution plans and production plans, drafts were written in advance and distributed to commune members for discussion and modification, and finally submitted to the commune member representative assembly for discussion and approval before being implemented. In this way, the commune members were very satisfied. They said: "When everyone handles matters concerning everyone, we will be more concerned about the commune."

    大家的事大家办
    河北河间县东风人民公社的党委和管理委员会，为了进一步贯彻管理民主化，最近曾发动社员对当前生产、生活和干部作风等问题，进行大鸣大放，提意见。除了运用大字报、黑板报、座谈会等形式鸣放外，社、队干部还分头深入群众搜集意见。乡党委和社管理委员会，根据群众鸣放出来的意见，逐条的进行了研究，并加以归纳整理，提出初步处理意见，交社员代表大会讨论，作了认真的处理，作到条条有交代，件件有着落。如社员们提出今年卖了这么多的棉花款，不发工资，也不知干什么用的。公社管委会就公布了建社两个月来的账目，让大家知道社里的收支情况，并根据社员的要求，提前发放了第一次工资，群众很满意。对于其他的重大问题，如分配方案和生产计划等，也都是事先写出草稿，发到社员中进行讨论修改，最后提交社员代表大会讨论通过，再贯彻执行。这样社员们都很满意。他们说：“大家的事，大家来办，我们就更关心社了。”
