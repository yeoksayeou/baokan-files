Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 20th: The Xuwen County water conservancy construction site in Guangdong Province is implementing methods of using several trained oxen to pull versatile harrows, double-furrow plows, and other tools, significantly improving the efficiency of earthwork projects. From November 18th to 19th, the entire county mobilized 2,336 people for earthwork projects, completing 184,821 cubic meters of earthwork, averaging 79 cubic meters per person per day. After inspection by the National Joint Water Conservancy Inspection Team, it has received commendation from the Ministry of Agriculture. Subsequently, the construction site launched a crash campaign, further improving work efficiency.

At the Xuwen County water conservancy construction site, one can see teams of oxen, like tamed warhorses, working under the command of the laborers. In the muddy ponds, one worker directs several oxen, pulling several double-wheeled, double-furrow plows to automatically plow the land back and forth; another worker drives a herd of oxen (ranging from ten to four or six), with two oxen pulling a versatile wooden harrow (large harrows pulled by two or three oxen each, small harrows pulled by one ox each), pair after pair, dragging the soil from the mud ponds to the earth dams, and then running back to the mud ponds from the earth dams, like a transportation brigade. With just a "command," the oxen drag the versatile harrows towards the dam. In this way, the workers can complete the earthwork tasks without much effort. Some well-trained oxen, except for needing workers to load soil in the mud ponds and unload soil on the earth dams, require no human management during transportation.

The versatile harrow in Xuwen County is extremely simple. This type of harrow resembles a small wooden dustpan used by farmers for sweeping garbage, six to seven feet wide, with a length similar to the dustpan, with handles on top to exert force when shoveling soil, and wooden wheels underneath to reduce pressure. This harrow is both easy to use and inexpensive to manufacture; a few pieces of wood are enough to make one.

When the Xuwen water conservancy construction site first started doing this, it encountered difficulties such as the oxen not being very obedient and fighting with each other. The solution to this problem was, first, to cultivate the herd behavior of the oxen. After a period of collective feeding, they no longer fought when they were together.

### 编组牛群队  拖拉万能耙  徐闻县水利工地提高工程效率

    编组牛群队  拖拉万能耙
    徐闻县水利工地提高工程效率
    新华社广州20日电  广东徐闻县水利工地实行一个人用几头驯牛牵引万能耙、双铧犁等方法，使土方工程效率显著提高。11月18日到19日两天，全县投入土方工程二千三百三十六人，完成了十八万四千八百二十一个土方，平均每人每天完成七十九个土方。经全国水利联合检查团检验后，已受到了中央农业部的通报表扬。以后，工地又展开突击运动，工效又有了进一步的提高。
    在徐闻县水利工地上，人们一眼望去就可以看到像驯服了的战马一样的成队成队的牛群，正在民工的指挥下进行工作。在泥塘里，一个民工指挥着几条牛，拖着几部双轮双铧犁自动来回犁地；另一个民工赶着一群牛（多者十头，少者四至六头），每二头牛拖着一个万能木板耙（大耙由两三头牛拖一部，小耙由一头牛拖一部），一对跟着一对地，把土从泥塘拖到土坝上，然后又从土坝跑回泥塘，如此来来往往，活像一队队的运输大队。民工们只要一声“号令”，牛群就拖着万能耙往坝上奔驰。这样，民工们就可以不费力地完成土方任务。有些久经训练的耕牛，它们除了在泥塘里要民工上土、在土坝上要民工卸土之外，在运输途中完全不用人来管理。
    徐闻县的万能耙是极其简便的。这种万能耙，形如农家扫地铲垃圾用的小木斗，六至七尺宽，长度和铲垃圾的木斗差不多，上有扶手，以便铲土用力，下有木轮以便减轻压力。这种耙既好用，造价又低，几块木板就可以造一部。
    徐闻水利工地开始这样做时，曾遇到牛不大听话、互相打架等困难。解决这个问题的办法，首先是培养耕牛的群居习惯，经过一段集体饲养，它们再到一起也就不打架了。
