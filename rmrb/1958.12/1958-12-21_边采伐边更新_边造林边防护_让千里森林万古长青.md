(By Bai Hao) The forest renewal movement and the movement to eliminate forest fires have laid the foundation for the beautiful long-term vision of the Greater Khingan Mountains forests remaining evergreen and the scenery being pleasant.

In the past, the forestry departments of the Greater Khingan Mountains held a one-sided view of emphasizing logging and neglecting renewal. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the forest renewal operation area was only more than 11,000 hectares, and seed collection was only more than 7,000 kilograms. This year, the policy of giving equal importance to renewal and logging was established, and a movement for forest renewal and seed collection was launched, setting off a renewal upsurge. A total of more than 61,200 hectares of planting, sowing, and artificial land preparation were completed to promote natural renewal operations, exceeding the total area of renewal operations during the first Five-Year Plan by 4.56 times.

In addition, the autumn movement to eliminate forest fires was also carried out extensively. The masses in the forest area all know that everyone is responsible for protecting forests and preventing fires. There are fire prevention networks everywhere, and every household has a fire prevention pact. Women of all ethnic groups diligently stand guard at major intersections, preventing people from bringing fire sources into the mountains and forests. It has become a habit for people not to smoke outside during the fire prevention period. The method of using forest protection aircraft in coordination with ground-based wireless and wired telephone fire alarm networks, combining national forest rangers with Oroqen, Ewenki, and other ethnic hunter forest rangers, and coordinating weather forecasts, the opening of soil isolation belts on forest edges, and mass fire fighting organizations enables timely detection and extinguishing of fires once they occur in the forest area. The close combination of widespread and in-depth mass movements with professional forest protection and fire prevention organizations has ensured that no forest fires occurred in this vast Greater Khingan Mountains area this autumn. The Oroqen Autonomous Banner, Xigui Banner, and Ergun Banner in the main forest areas have recently been recognized as national model units for forest protection and fire prevention.

    边采伐边更新  边造林边防护    
    让千里森林万古长青
    本报讯  林区的更新运动和无森林火灾运动，为大兴安岭森林万古长青、风景宜人的美好远景打下了基础。
    过去大兴安岭的林业部门由于存在着重视采伐轻视更新的片面观点，在第一个五年计划期间，森林更新作业面积仅有一万一千多公顷，采种只有七千多公斤。今年确定了更新与采伐并举的方针，开展了森林更新和采种运动，掀起了更新高潮。完成植树、播种和人工整地，促进天然更新作业面积共达六万一千二百多公顷，超过第一个五年计划期间更新作业总面积的四点五六倍。
    此外，今秋无森林火灾运动也开展得很广泛。林区群众都知道护林防火人人有责。处处有防火网，户户有防火公约。主要路口都有各族妇女认真站岗放哨，不让人们随便把火源带上山林。人们在防火期不在外面吸烟已成习惯。采用护林飞机与地面的无线、有线电话火情警报网相配合，国家护林员与鄂伦春、鄂温克等族猎民护林员相结合，气象预报、开辟林缘生土隔离带与群众救火组织相配合的办法，使林区一旦发生火情，能以及时发现和扑灭。广泛深入的群众运动与专业护林防火组织紧密结合，使这幅员辽阔的大兴安岭今秋未发生森林火灾。主要林区的鄂伦春自治旗、喜桂图旗和额尔古纳旗最近已被评为全国护林防火模范单位。
