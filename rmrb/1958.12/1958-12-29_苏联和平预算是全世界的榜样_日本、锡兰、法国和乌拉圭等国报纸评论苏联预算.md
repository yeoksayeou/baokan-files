Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Newspapers in Japan, Ceylon, France, and other countries generally attach great importance to the Soviet Union's budget for next year and compare it with the United States' budget. Japanese newspapers widely commented on the results of the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting. Many newspapers' headlines pointed out that the Soviet Union's 1959 budget reduced defense spending, and the Soviet Union is ready to permanently halt nuclear tests at any time.

    "Sankei Shimbun" wrote in an editorial commenting on the National Budget Law passed by the Supreme Soviet, "The Soviet Union's new budget stipulates increased allocations for the development of the national economy, social security, and cultural needs, which is worthy of great attention."
    The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union is fully determined to surpass the United States in the economic field, and reminded Western countries to "seriously treat the Soviet Union's seven-year economic plan for developing the national economy and regard it as the first stage in the economic competition between the two systems."
    The resolutions of the Soviet Supreme Soviet aroused widespread reactions among people from all walks of life in Ceylon. Pelis, a teacher at a Buddhist school in Ceylon, described the Soviet budget passed by the Supreme Soviet as a "model for the world" in an interview with a TASS reporter. He said, "There is no doubt that the Soviet Union is committed to peace." The discussion of the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on the 1959 Soviet national budget aroused great interest among the French public and the press. Many newspapers published detailed information and commentaries in prominent positions.
    Political commentators and economists unanimously pointed out that the Soviet Union's defense spending has been reduced, while allocations for further development of various sectors of the national economy, as well as science and culture, have been greatly increased. Even some bourgeois newspapers have had to admit that Western countries, contrary to the situation in the Soviet Union, continue to increase military spending to intensify the arms race. "Paris Radical News" said, "The Russians' military spending is constantly being reduced, while the Americans' military spending is constantly increasing." "Combat" pointed out, "The U.S. government will propose a military program for the 1959-1960 fiscal year, and the military spending stipulated in the program will exceed any military budget in peacetime."
    "L'Aurore" admitted that "the 1959 Soviet national budget shows that communism is economically superior to capitalism."
    Uruguay's "El Día", in a news item titled "Russia's 1959 Budget is Expressed in Extraordinary Figures," pointed out that the draft Soviet budget stipulates increased investment in industry and increased allocations for scientific research and improving the material welfare of all Soviet people. The newspaper wrote that next year, the Soviet Union will greatly increase spending on education, housing construction, and agriculture. "El Popular" published a headline on the news of the opening of the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting: "The Soviet Union is reducing its military spending; the United States is greatly increasing this spending."
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 27th: "Al-Rai al-A'am" wrote on the 27th, when comparing the budgets of the United States and the Soviet Union this year, that people can easily see that the United States' budget "serves the aggressive policy of war preparation and is based on Hitler's policies as a blueprint, while the Soviet Union's budget aims to serve peace and the welfare of all peoples."
    The newspaper continued that the Soviet Union's budget once again proves that it is striving to serve peace, while at the same time it has taken peaceful measures to reduce troops, put forward proposals to resolve the Berlin issue, and unilaterally suspended nuclear tests; on the other hand, it has lowered prices and increased wages, thereby improving people's living standards.
    The newspaper said, "The increase in spending in the United States' budget has increased the burden on the American people, creating a new attack on their lives." The newspaper said that these measures by the United States "will awaken the American people, and one day they will rise up and eliminate this handful of monopoly capitalists."

    苏联和平预算是全世界的榜样
    日本、锡兰、法国和乌拉圭等国报纸评论苏联预算
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：日本、锡兰、法国等国报纸普遍重视苏联明年的预算，并和美国的预算对比。日本报纸广泛评论苏联最高苏维埃会议的成果。很多报纸的标题指出，苏联1959年的预算缩减了国防开支，苏联准备随时永远停止核试验。
      “产经新闻”在评论最高苏维埃会议通过的国家预算法的社论中写道，“苏联的新预算规定，增加对发展国民经济、社会保障和文化需要方面的拨款，这是值得十分注意的事”。
    这家报纸指出苏联有充分的决心在经济领域内超过美国，并且提醒西方国家“认真地对待苏联发展国民经济的七年经济计划，应该把它看作是两个系统经济竞赛中的第一阶段”。
    苏联最高苏维埃的决议在锡兰各界人士中引起了广泛的反应。锡兰佛教学校教员佩利斯在向塔斯社记者发表谈话时，把最高苏维埃会议通过的苏联预算称为“全世界的榜样”。他说，“苏联致力于和平，这是丝毫不容置疑的”。苏联最高苏维埃会议关于1959年苏联国家预算的讨论引起了法国公众和报界的极大兴趣。许多报纸都在显要地位刊载了详细资料和评论文章。
    政治评论员和经济学家都一致指出，苏联国防开支有所削减，而用于进一步发展国民经济各部门以及科学和文化的拨款却大大增加了。甚至某些资产阶级报纸也不得不承认，西方国家却同苏联的情况相反，它们继续增加军费，以加紧军备竞赛。“巴黎激进新闻”说，“俄国人的军费在不断削减，而美国人的军费却在不断增加”。“战斗报”指出，“美国政府在1959—1960年财政年度将提出这样一个军事计划， 计划规定的军费将超过和平时期任何一次军事预算”。
    “震旦报”承认，“1959年苏联国家预算表明共产主义在经济方面比资本主义优越。”
    乌拉圭“晨报”在一篇题为“俄国1959年的预算用不平常的数字表现出来”的消息中指出，苏联预算草案规定，增加对工业的投资，增加对科学研究工作和提高全体苏联人民的物质福利的拨款。报纸写道，在明年，苏联将大大地增加在教育、住宅建筑和农业等方面的开支。“人民论坛报”刊载苏联最高苏维埃会议开幕的消息的标题是：“苏联正在缩减自己的军事开支；美国却在大大地增加这种开支。”
    新华社巴格达27日电  “舆论报”27日在就美国和苏联今年的预算加以比较时写道，人们可以很容易地看出，美国的预算是“为备战的侵略政策服务的，是以希特勒的政策作为蓝本的，而苏联的预算目的则是为和平和各族人民的福利服务的。”
    这家报纸接着说，苏联的预算再一次证明它是努力为和平服务的，同时它还采取了裁减军队的和平措施、提出解决柏林问题的建议，并且单方面地停止核试验；另一方面它减低物价、提高工资，从而提高人民的生活水平。
    这家报纸说，“美国在预算中增加开支使美国人民的负担加重，造成对他们生活的一次新的进攻”。报纸说，美国的这些措施“将使美国人民觉醒，总有一天他们会起来消灭这一撮垄断资本家的”。
