    The Only Difference
    The right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party, Mollet, once formed an alliance with Soustelle's "Union for the New Republic" in the election, and now he is energetically promoting De Gaulle's election as president. This was originally the two-part movement of his open betrayal. However, when Mollet was shouting loudly that the Socialist Party should support De Gaulle's election as president, he insisted that De Gaulle was not the "same thing" as the "Union for the New Republic."
    Probably Mollet believes that by making such a distinction, he can avoid the stigma of supporting Soustelle. However, the only difference, as revealed in a cartoon in "l'Humanité", is that when Soustelle was campaigning for De Gaulle, Mollet was merely Soustelle's stepping stone.

    唯一的区别
    法国社会党的右翼领袖摩勒在选举中曾同苏斯戴尔的“保卫新共和联盟”结成了联盟，现在又开始替戴高乐当选总统大卖力气了。这本来是他的公开叛卖行为的两部曲。但摩勒在大叫大喊地要社会党应该支持戴高乐当选总统时，却要把戴高乐同“保卫新共和联盟”说成不是“同一东西”。
    大概摩勒认为，这样区别一下，他就可以免掉支持苏斯戴尔的臭名了。但是，唯一的区别，不过是像“人道报”一幅漫画所揭露的：当苏斯戴尔为戴高乐竞选的时候，摩勒不过是做了苏斯戴尔的垫脚石罢了。
