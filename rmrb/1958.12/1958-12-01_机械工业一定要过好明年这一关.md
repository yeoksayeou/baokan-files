    The mass movement of steel and iron smelting by the whole party and the entire people has formed an unprecedented high tide. All machinery factories across the country, regardless of size, newness, or oldness, are vigorously engaged in steel and iron smelting equipment. After a short period of intensive work, they have produced many blast furnaces, converters, and related equipment. However, the capacity of the two ends of smelting—mining and steel rolling—still cannot meet the needs. Next year, under the principle of taking steel as the key link to drive other industries, the scale of steel and iron smelting will be further expanded, and mining equipment and steel rolling equipment urgently need to be resolved. Coal industry equipment, copper and aluminum smelting equipment, power generation equipment, major transportation equipment, and equipment for the petroleum, cement, and basic chemical industries, which are compatible with steel production, should also follow suit. The machinery industry's task of equipping itself must also be guaranteed to be completed. Therefore, the production scale and development speed of China's machinery industry next year will be unprecedented in our history.
    During the First Five-Year Plan, many factories were established in the machinery industry. However, to adapt to the current situation, it is far from enough. Not only is the production capacity only able to guarantee key projects and cannot meet the needs of various aspects, but the technology also appears to be not high enough. In particular, heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products cannot be fully mastered. The requesting departments cannot "do whatever they want," and the machinery industry cannot "handle things with ease." It has not escaped the passive situation and cannot be completely free. Heavy tasks, small capacity, many demands, and few varieties are the basic contradictions facing the machinery industry. We must do everything possible to overcome the hurdle of insufficient capacity and low technology.
    Can the machinery industry overcome this hurdle next year? Judging from the situation of this year's great production development, we believe that there are conditions and it is possible.
    Since the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policy of taking steel as the key link and instructed to implement political command and carry out mass movements in industry, the machinery industry has swept away the cold and deserted situation and ushered in a new atmosphere of vigorous activity. Production has increased several times, and some products that could not be made in the past can now be made. Why is there such a big change? First, people's minds have been liberated, superstitions have been broken, and they dare to make revolution, thus greatly liberating the productive forces. Second, the road of developing industry with steel as the key link has been recognized. In the past few years, the machinery industry lacked raw materials, and the technological improvement was not fast. It had not found a way to develop rapidly. Since the proposal of taking steel as the key link and the nationwide campaign to produce steel, the entire industry has been driven, and the machinery industry has been able to make rapid progress and has greatly developed. The road that had not been found for many years has now been recognized. Third, the working method of using mass movements to vigorously develop industry has been affirmed. In the past, many people held a skeptical attitude towards whether mass movements could be carried out in industry. This year, the situation forced people to take action, and after the masses rose up, thousands upon thousands of vivid examples emerged, giving people great education. This ideological problem is beginning to be resolved. Not only do they believe that mass movements should be vigorously carried out in existing factories, but they also begin to believe that the entire people should be mobilized to vigorously run the machinery industry.
    To overcome the hurdle of insufficient capacity and low technology, the machinery industry must vigorously carry out mass movements and vigorously engage in technological revolution. In developing production capacity, using agriculture as an analogy, there are two ways: one is to "increase the yield per unit area" in existing factories; the other is to "reclaim wasteland" and increase new production capacity. Combining the two at the same time can rapidly increase production capacity. However, fully utilizing existing potential is the fastest and most realistic way to solve the current contradiction of insufficient capacity. Therefore, while combining the two, we must also focus on "increasing the yield per unit area." In improving the technical level, we must fight hard for three years to break through heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products so that the machinery industry can gain freedom.
    If these tasks are done well, this hurdle will be overcome next year.
    Multiplying Existing Capacity Several Times
    The ways to increase the yield per unit area in agriculture can also be applied to industrial production. We must use the method of carrying out mass movements to lead industrial production and fully utilize the potential of the factory's existing manpower, area, and equipment. Vigorously engage in "high-yield fields" in teams, groups, and workshops to create high-yield records. Summarize these high-yield experiences and formulate key and effective measures like agriculture's "water, fertilizer, soil, density, seed, prevention, labor, and management," and promote them from point to area, to the entire factory and even the entire country, so that production capacity can be multiplied several times without increasing people, equipment, or production area. If all factories across the country are multiplied several times, it is equivalent to adding several times the number of factories. The Changchun Automobile Factory originally planned to produce 30,000 vehicles per year, and there was only one variety. For several years, it had always believed that even after taking measures, it could only double at most. Recently, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, the factory fully mobilized the masses, vigorously carried out ideological revolution, and implemented two participations, one reform, and three combinations. On this basis, the factory vigorously engaged in technological revolution and carried out revolutions in design, technology, equipment, production organization, and management methods. The production capacity will jump from 30,000 vehicles per year to 150,000 vehicles and become a factory that produces multiple varieties of automobiles. Similar examples can be found in heavy machinery factories, machine tool factories, shipbuilding factories, and general machinery factories. Now it seems that increasing production by one or two times should be regarded as normal by general factories; three or four times is also possible for many factories.
    Vigorously carrying out mass movements and vigorously engaging in technological revolution in factories to increase the factory's production capacity by several times is a major revolution for every factory.
    Judging from the current general trend, the small and old factories are still the most enthusiastic about revolution. Small and old factories have small families, fewer rules, fewer concerns, and their minds are relatively easy to liberate. Technological revolutions are relatively easy to carry out, and mass movements are also more in-depth. There are some small and old factories in various places that, under very poor material conditions, mobilize the masses and vigorously engage in indigenous equipment, using small machines to do big jobs. For example, the Harbin Jilian Machinery Factory is a factory with no large factory buildings, no large equipment, no large cranes, and no large cast steel equipment, and is known as a "four-nothing" factory. They work hard, work diligently, and work cleverly to manufacture many large-scale mining and power machinery. Some cadres in large factories have not liberated their minds and do not truly believe that the workers are the masters of production. They have large families and do not understand the situation. There are rules and regulations everywhere, so they are afraid of chaos when carrying out mass movements and often do not achieve much. However, large and new factories have great potential and excellent conditions. As long as they can put politics in command, rely on the masses, liberate their minds, dare to make revolution, and carry out necessary reforms according to specific circumstances, one doubling is equivalent to dozens or hundreds of small factories. In this regard, it is very important to promote large and new factories to learn from small and old factories.
    Increasing New Production Capacity
    Although the "increasing the yield per unit area" approach is effective quickly, it cannot fundamentally change the unreasonable distribution of the machinery industry. Therefore, it is also necessary to actively "reclaim wasteland" and increase new production capacity. The so-called "reclaiming wasteland" refers to the fact that under comprehensive planning and overall arrangements, the central and local governments will add a number of backbone factories, adjust the current layout, and build machinery industry systems in various regions and provinces according to different conditions. On the other hand, it is also necessary to mobilize the people to run machinery factories and vigorously engage in the "small indigenous groups" of the machinery industry, so that every county, township, and commune has machinery factories to meet local needs.
    In next year's production tasks, about 40% will rely on newly built backbone factories to complete. It is very important to concentrate efforts to speed up the construction of these new factories and require most factories to put into production around the second quarter of next year. However, there are many new factory projects, and it is impossible to spread out all the projects at once. We must build them in batches and phases, finishing one batch before starting another. Based on the experience of various places, in the construction of new factories, we must implement the principle of building, trial-producing, and producing at the same time. In this way, the speed can be two or three times faster than in the past, or even four times faster.
    In the construction of new factories, civil engineering is very fast. Therefore, we must strive to solve the equipment problem. Currently, there are two situations: one is waiting for the state to allocate and hoping to import from abroad. The state can certainly allocate some, and some can also be imported from abroad, but "there is little porridge and many monks," and the time cannot be met. The other is to rely mainly on self-reliance, simplify equipment, and organize manufacturing forces locally to vigorously engage in indigenous equipment and simple equipment. Many factories are currently doing this, and the effect is excellent. They have made many large vertical lathes, large boring machines, and five-ton and ten-ton wooden reinforced concrete cranes with cement bases and certain parts. These equipments have low precision and efficiency, and are fast and economical. Now it seems that it is most realistic to solve the problem by relying mainly on self-reliance.
    Secondly, it is also necessary to quickly train and train personnel to master technology so that the factory can play its role immediately after it is built. We must use staff dormitories, temporary sheds, schools, old factories, etc. as much as possible, simplify equipment, conduct trial production of new products in advance, fully exert subjective initiative, create conditions, and overcome difficulties. If this is done, the factory can be put into production immediately after it is built, and the time to reach the design level may be greatly shortened. Generally, light factories can reach the design level shortly after being put into production; more complex factories can reach it within half a year; and heavy factories can reach it in about a year.
    In addition to the central and local construction of backbone factories, it is even more important to mobilize the broad masses of people to run machinery factories. Whether the masses can do it or not, we have a development process in our understanding. At first, we thought that counties, townships, and communes could only engage in repair and maintenance. Since the central government proposed that the entire people run industry, especially after the upsurge of communization, the masses ran many machinery factories. Our minds were opened, and we realized that the machinery industry must also have an important aspect of "small indigenous groups." Now the situation is becoming more and more obvious. Mines, agriculture, and rural sideline occupations all need to engage in mechanization or semi-mechanization to liberate labor. In this way, without mobilizing the people to run it, the problem cannot be solved quickly.
    Judging from the experience of Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province, Tianjin Prefecture in Hebei Province, Danyang County in Jiangsu Province, and other places in vigorously running the machinery industry, it is entirely possible for counties, townships, and communes across the country to run the machinery industry.
    Before the Great Leap Forward, Fuyang Prefecture had only five iron factories with a total of ninety-two old machine tools. After three months of hard work, they armed themselves, and now they have more than 1,200 iron machine tools and more than 4,000 wooden and iron-wood mixed machine tools. The machinery industry network of the entire prefecture has been formed, and every commune has a machinery factory.
    In the past three months, Tianjin Prefecture has manufactured more than 4,100 simple machine tools, which has increased the machinery equipment of the entire region by ten times. It has equipped 165 machinery factories in the prefecture, county, and commune, and trained a machinery industry team of more than 30,000 people.
    Danyang had no machinery factory before, but in less than a year, starting from scratch, it has established machinery manufacturing factories, agricultural tool repair factories, hardware factories, motor factories, and ball bearing factories. Because of these small machinery factories, other factories needed for local industrial and agricultural development can also be established. Iron smelting factories and metal smelting factories have already been established, and silk reeling factories, paper mills, pesticide factories, fertilizer factories, and cement factories are being established. In this way, local resources can be comprehensively utilized to develop production and improve the lives of the people.
    Their methods are: "Mobilizing the masses, relying on self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and focusing on indigenous methods." They searched everywhere for handicraft workers and skilled farmers, turned them into carpenters, blacksmiths, and sand casters; and used civilian houses and temples to set up stalls and hang signs to run factories. The first step is to make three simple machine tools: a lathe for turning round parts, a planer for planing flat surfaces, and a drill for drilling holes. Generally speaking, the processing of machine parts is not mysterious. It is nothing more than round, flat, and perforated shapes. With these three simple machine tools, general simple parts can be processed. Then, power machines can also be made. With machine tools and power machines, many simple machines can be made. As for the blank problem, it can also be solved by combining iron and steel smelting in various places. With a blast furnace, pig iron parts can be cast; with a converter, cast steel parts can be made. In this way, from low to high, from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, the machinery industry is "alive." This is fast and economical. Any place can be established quickly.
    Using "small indigenous groups" to run the machinery industry can form a massive movement. Machines are manufactured everywhere, and machines are used everywhere. Combined with backbone factories, a machinery industry network combining large, medium, and small is formed. There are both "militia" and "regular army," attacking together, cooperating with each other, and improving together. In this way, the task instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong, that machines should be used in all places where machines can be used, can be accelerated.
    Fully Relying on the Masses to Master Heavy, Large, Precision, and Cutting-Edge Products
    The machinery industry can only increase in quantity and not change in quality, and it cannot completely escape the passive situation and gain freedom. At the beginning of this year, we proposed to fight hard for three years to break through the hurdle of heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products and rapidly improve the technical level. Now it seems that this task is even more urgent. This year is almost over, and next year will be a decisive year.
    To master heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products, three standards must be met: 1. It must catch up with or exceed the most advanced level of similar products in the world; 2. It must be designed independently in combination with China's situation; 3. It must master the technology of mass manufacturing and organize production. If these three standards are met, it will be considered successful. Therefore, all machinery industry departments and relevant schools, research, and design departments should further formulate plans and strive to achieve this goal.
    In view of the fact that many enterprises often launch mass movements to develop new products when presenting gifts to the country, we are preparing to launch a large-scale gift-giving movement next year to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, as a slogan to widely mobilize the masses. All walks of life and all units should submit a gift list, formulate measures, and break through the main heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products one by one. After making gifts, we should quickly summarize experience and formally put them into production. In this way, there will be more heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products, and technology will be gradually mastered.
    During the Great Leap Forward this year, some rose sharply and shone brightly in mastering new technologies, while others were silent and saw no results. The basic key lies in whether they dare to completely break the theory of technological mystery, whether they can abandon the route of unilaterally relying on experts, and whether they can adhere to the mass line and vigorously carry out mass movements.
    The influence of the theory of technological mystery is still very large, and many people have not been liberated from its constraints. These people believe in books, not practical experience; believe in themselves, believe in a few experts, and do not believe in the creation of the broad masses. They only wander between books and do not come into contact with reality. If they do not move their desks to the masses and to production, the theory of technological mystery cannot be broken, and they will be hesitant in technology and cannot shine brightly.
    Resolutely implementing the mass line in scientific and technological work is a fundamental issue. In many places, the route of unilaterally relying on experts has not been completely abandoned. There are lines of defense, and they are always uneasy and do not believe that the masses can engage in science and technology. Sometimes they also discuss with the masses, but it is only a formality, or they draw a framework first and limit it, and they do not sincerely rely on the masses. In these places, it is cold and deserted, and no sign of prosperity can be seen. Anyone who goes against this will show a new atmosphere. Now, under the leadership of the Party, many factories have used the method of three combinations. Workers have put forward many good initiatives in technology and design and have made many good products. These facts show that when practical experience is combined with theory, they complement each other and promote each other, and many technical mysteries will be solved easily. Only in this way can scientific and technological work break out of the old circle and move towards a new world.
    In research and design units, there is also an argument that mass movements are "noisy" and useless for research and design work. This is a theory of closed-door research. Many of the things researched and designed in this way are either impassable or full of errors. The greater disadvantage is that it cannot form a momentum for vigorously engaging in research and design. When encountering difficulties, they are helpless, and some important new products often cannot be produced for years. Therefore, in research and design work, it is also necessary to put politics in command, rely on the masses, assign tasks to the masses, launch debates, advocate the style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and carry out evaluations and movements. In this way, many heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products will come out.
    Tasks Must Be Ranked, Products Must Be Complete Sets, and Materials Must Be Based on Domestic Production
    Implementing task ranking, ensuring complete sets of products, and doing a good job in material supply are very important for completing next year's tasks.
    According to the spirit of the instructions of the Party Central Committee, production arrangements must distinguish between urgency and importance and implement ranking. It is impossible to hope to rush up and advance simultaneously. Therefore, we must first concentrate our efforts to solve steel rolling, mining, power station equipment, machine tools, and major transportation equipment. Correspondingly, we will produce equipment for the petroleum, cement, basic chemical industries, and light industry equipment necessary for coordination with heavy industry. In terms of agricultural needs, in addition to tractors and power machinery, which should be arranged appropriately, other products should basically rely on the masses of people in counties, townships, and communes to run factories on a large scale and solve them locally.
    Next year, the task of collaboration and matching will be very heavy. In the past, throughout the country, regardless of the size of the products, they were all uniformly allocated. Today, it seems that this method cannot adapt to the new situation. Next year, we must adopt the method of comprehensive planning, key allocation, regional completion, and mutual support. Important products should still be unified planned and allocated by the central government; general products should be balanced by large regions and gradually establish new collaborative and matching relationships; industrially weak areas must be supported by external regions.
    Material supply is a key to next year's production. In the past few years, especially since the national steel and iron smelting campaign this year, China's material production has developed rapidly in terms of quantity and variety; however, a tense supply situation has emerged in the Great Leap Forward. Next year, the production tasks of machinery equipment will be increased several times. The amount of steel, copper, and aluminum needed throughout the year will be much more than this year, the variety specifications require complete sets, and the supply time must be timely. Therefore, the way to solve the material problem is to basically rely on domestic production, except for striving to import a few special varieties. In this way, the smooth progress of production can be guaranteed.

    机械工业一定要过好明年这一关
    赵尔陆
    全党全民炼钢炼铁运动，已经形成空前高潮。全国机械工厂不分大小新旧，都在大搞炼钢炼铁设备，经过短期突击，生产了很多高炉、转炉及其配套设备。但冶炼的两头——开矿和轧钢的能力还是不能适应需要。明年在以钢为纲带动其他的方针下，炼钢炼铁的规模还要扩大，矿山设备和轧钢设备急需解决。与钢铁生产相适应的煤炭工业设备、炼铜炼铝设备、发电设备、主要交通运输设备，石油、水泥和基本化学工业设备也应当跟着上来。机械工业装备自己的任务，也要保证完成。因此，明年我国机械工业的生产规模和发展速度，将是我国历史上前所未有的。
    在第一个五年计划期间，机械工业方面办了不少工厂。但要适应现在的形势，还差得很远，不仅生产能力上只能保证重点，不能适应多方面的需要，而且技术上也显得不高，特别是重型、大型、精密、尖端产品，还不能全部掌握。需要部门既不能“随心所欲”，机械工业更不能“得心应手”，没有摆脱被动局面，不能完全自由。任务重，能力小，要求多，品种少，是摆在机械工业面前的基本矛盾。我们必须千方百计，过好能力不足，技术不高的关。
    明年机械工业能不能过好这一关？根据今年生产大发展的情形来看，我们认为是有条件的，是可能的。
    自从党中央和毛泽东同志提出以钢为纲的方针，并指示在工业里实行政治挂帅、大搞群众运动以来，机械工业一扫冷冷清清的局面，出现一片轰轰烈烈的新气象，生产成倍地上升，过去一些不能做的产品也能做了。为什么能有这样大的变化呢？一、人们的思想解放了，破除了迷信，敢于革命了，因而大大解放了生产力。二、认清了以钢为纲发展工业的道路。过去几年，机械工业原材料不足，技术提高不快，没有找到一条能够迅速发展的道路。自从提出以钢为纲，全国大搞钢铁，整个工业都被带动起来了，机械工业就能够突飞猛进，有了很大发展。多年来没有找到的道路，现在认清了。三、肯定了用群众运动大搞工业的工作方法。在工业上能否大搞群众运动，过去不少人抱着怀疑态度。今年形势一逼，群众起来以后，产生了千千万万的生动事例，给人们很大教育，这个思想问题，正在开始解决。不仅相信在现有工厂里要大搞群众运动，而且也开始相信，要发动全民来大办机械工业。
    机械工业要过好能力不足、技术不高的关，必须大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。在发展生产能力上，用农业做比喻，有两条途径：一是在现有工厂里“提高单位面积产量”；一是“开生荒”，增加新的生产能力。两者同时并举，就能够使生产能力迅速增长上去。而充分发挥现有潜力，对解决当前能力不足的矛盾，是最快、最现实的办法。因此，同时并举，还要以“提高单位面积产量”为主。在提高技术水平上，要苦战三年，突破重型、大型、精密、尖端产品，才能使机械工业获得自由。
    做好这些工作，明年这一关就过好了。
    使现有能力翻上几番
    农业上提高单位面积产量的途径，同样可以适用于工业生产。要用搞群众运动的方法，来领导工业生产，充分发挥工厂现有的人力、面积和设备的潜力。在班、组、车间大搞“丰产田”，创造高产纪录。总结这些高产经验，订出像农业的“水、肥、土、密、种、防、工、管”那样关键性的有效措施，由点到面，推及全厂以至全国，就能使生产能力在不增加人、不增加设备、不增加生产面积的条件下，翻上几番。如果全国所有工厂统统翻上几倍，就等于增加几倍的工厂。长春汽车厂原定年产三万辆汽车，而且只有一个品种，几年来一直认为，在采取措施后，最多也不过翻一番。最近该厂在党委领导下，充分发动群众，大搞思想革命，实行两参、一改、三结合。在这个基础上，大闹技术革命，进行设计、工艺、设备、生产组织、管理方法等方面的革命，生产能力由年产三万辆将一跃而为十五万辆，并且变成一个生产多品种汽车的工厂。像这类例子，在重型机器厂、机床厂、造船厂和通用机器厂等，都能找到。现在看来，增产一倍两倍，一般工厂应该视为常规；三倍四倍，很多工厂也是可能的。
    在工厂里大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，使工厂的生产能力加上几倍，这对每一个工厂都是一场大革命。
    从现在一般的趋势来看，革命劲头最足的，还是小厂旧厂。小厂旧厂家当小，规矩少，顾虑不多，思想比较容易解放，技术革命比较容易开展，群众运动也比较深入。各地都有一些小厂旧厂，在很差的物质条件下，发动群众，就大搞土设备，用小机器干大活。如哈尔滨机联机械厂，是一个无大厂房、无大设备、无大吊车、无大铸钢设备的被称为四无的工厂，他们穷干、苦干、巧干，制造出许多大型的矿山、动力机械。有些大厂的干部思想没有解放，不是真正相信工人群众是生产的主人。他们家当大，不摸底，到处是清规戒律，因而一搞群众运动就怕乱，往往搞不出多少名堂。但是大厂新厂潜力很大，条件很好，只要能政治挂帅，依靠群众，解放思想，勇于革命，根据具体情况进行必要的改革，一翻就相当于几十个几百个小厂。在这方面，推动大厂新厂向小厂旧厂学习，是十分重要的。
    增加新的生产能力
    “提高单位面积产量”这个途径，虽然见效快，但不能根本改变机械工业分布不合理的面貌。因此，还必须积极地“开生荒”，增加新的生产能力。所谓“开生荒”，一方面是指在全面规划、统筹安排之下，由中央和地方增建一批骨干工厂，调整目前的布局，根据不同的条件，建成各区、各省的机械工业体系。另一方面，还要发动人民群众来办机械工厂，大搞机械工业的“小土群”，做到每个县、乡、社都有机械工厂，满足当地的需要。
    在明年生产任务中，大约有四成左右，要依靠新建的骨干工厂来完成。集中力量，加快这些新厂的建设，并要求大部分工厂在明年第二季度前后投入生产，是十分重要的。但新厂项目多，也不能一下都铺起摊子，必须分批分期建设，干完一批，再干一批。综合各地经验，在新厂建设上，要实行边建设、边试制、边生产的方针。这样，速度就可以比过去快两倍三倍，甚至四倍。
    在新厂建设上，土建工程是很快的，因此，要努力解决设备问题。目前有两种情况：一种是等待国家分配，希望国外进口。国家固然可以分配一些，国外也可以进口一些，但“粥少僧多”，时间又赶不上。一种是以自力更生为主，因陋就简，就地组织制造力量，大搞土设备和简易设备。目前有许多工厂就是这样做的，效果极好。他们制成很多用水泥做底座和某些部件的大立车、大搪床、以及五吨、十吨的木质钢筋吊车。这些设备，精度和效率都不低，又快又经济。现在看来，以自力更生为主来解决问题，是最现实的。
    其次，还要迅速培养和训练人员，掌握技术，使工厂建成之后，立刻发挥作用。要尽可能利用职工宿舍、临时工棚、学校、老厂等，因陋就简，提前进行新产品试制，充分发挥主观能动性，创造条件，克服困难。这样办，工厂一建成，马上就可以投入生产，而且达到设计水平的时间，有可能大大缩短。一般轻型工厂，投入生产后，不久即可达到设计水平；比较复杂的工厂，半年内也可以达到；重型工厂，一年左右也就行了。
    除中央和地方建设骨干工厂外，更要动员广大人民群众来办机械工厂。群众能不能办，我们在认识上有一个发展过程。起初想到县、乡、社只能搞些修配。自从中央提出全民办工业，特别是公社化高潮起来之后，群众办了许多机械工厂，我们思想开阔了，认识到机械工业也必须有“小土群”这一个重要方面。现在形势愈来愈明显，矿山和农业、农村副业等都需要搞机械化或半机械化，以解放劳动力。这样，不动员人民群众来办，是不能很快解决问题的。
    从安徽阜阳专区、河北天津专区、江苏丹阳县等地大办机械工业的经验来看，全国县、乡、社都办机械工业，是完全可能的。
    阜阳专区在跃进前只有五个铁工厂，共有九十二台旧机床。他们苦战三月，自己武装自己，现在已有铁制机床一千二百多台，木制及铁木混合的机床四千多台。全专区机械工业网已经形成，社社都有机械厂。
    天津专区在近三个月来，制造了四千一百多台简易机床，使全区的机械设备翻了十番，装备了专、县、社的一百六十五个机械工厂，培养了三万多人的机械工业队伍。
    丹阳以前一个机械厂都没有，但不到一年时间，从无到有，白手起家，已经办成机械制造厂、农具修配厂、五金厂、电机厂和滚珠轴承厂。因为有了这些小机械厂，地方上发展工农业所需要的其他工厂也就可以办起来了。现在已经办起炼铁厂、金属冶炼厂，正在办缫丝厂、造纸厂、农药厂、化肥厂、水泥厂。这样便可以综合利用当地资源，发展生产，改善人民群众的生活。
    他们的办法是：“发动群众，自力更生，土洋结合，以土为主”。到处搜罗手工业工人、有手艺的农民，把他们变成木匠、铁匠、翻砂匠；并且利用民房、庙宇来摆摊子、挂招牌，就办起工厂来了。头一步是做出三种简易的机床：车圆的车床、刨平面的刨床、钻孔的钻床。一般机器零件的加工，说来也没有什么神秘，不外乎是圆的、平面的与带孔的形状。有了这三种简易的机床，一般简单零件就可以加工了。然后，动力机也可以做了。有工具机，有动力机，许多简易机器都有可能做了。至于毛坯问题，也可以结合各地炼铁炼钢来解决。有高炉就可以翻生铁件，有转炉就可以做铸钢件。这样，由低到高，由小到大，由土到洋，机械工业就“活”了。这样办，又快、又省。任何地方，都可以很快地办起来。
    用“小土群”来办机械工业，能够形成一个声势浩大的运动。遍地造机器，遍地用机器，同骨干工厂结合起来，形成一个大、中、小相结合的机械工业网。又有“民兵”，又有“正规军”，一起出击，相互配合，共同提高。这样一来，毛泽东同志所指示的，在一切能够使用机器的地方，统统使用机器操作，这个任务，就可以加速实现。
    充分依靠群众，掌握重型、大型、精密、尖端产品
    机械工业只有数量的增加，没有质量的改变，还不能完全摆脱被动局面，获得自由。今年年初我们曾经提出苦战三年，突破重型、大型、精密、尖端产品的关，迅速提高技术水平。现在看来，这个任务显得更加迫切。今年快过去了，明年将是决定性的一年。
    掌握重型、大型、精密、尖端产品，要具备三个标准：一、必须赶上或者超过世界同类产品最先进的水平；二、要结合我国情况，自行设计；三、掌握大量制造的技术，组织生产。具备这三个标准，就算过关了。因此，所有的机械工业部门和有关的学校、研究和设计部门，都要进一步订出规划，为达到这一目的而努力。
    鉴于许多企业在向国家献礼时，往往出现搞新产品的群众运动，我们准备在明年搞一次大规模的献礼运动，迎接建国十周年，以此作为广泛动员群众的口号。各行各业，各个单位，都提个礼单，订出措施，把主要的重型、大型、精密、尖端产品，一一突破。做出礼品之后，就迅速总结经验，正式投入生产。这样，重型、大型、精密、尖端产品就会多起来，技术也就逐步掌握了。
    今年大跃进过程中，在掌握新技术上，有异军突起大放光彩的，也有默默无闻不见成绩的。基本关键就在于敢不敢彻底打破技术神秘论，能不能丢掉片面依靠专家的路线，能不能坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动。
    技术神秘论的影响还很大，许多人还没有从它的束缚下解放出来。这些人相信书本，不相信实践经验；相信自己，相信少数专家，不相信广大群众的创造，见物不见人。他们只徘徊于书本之间，不和实际接触。如果他们不把桌子搬到群众中去，搬到生产中去，技术神秘论就不能打破，在技术上就会跼蹐不前，不能放出光彩。
    在科学技术工作中坚决贯彻群众路线，是一个根本问题。不少地方，片面依靠专家的路线还未丢得干净，有一道一道的防线，总是不放心，不相信群众能搞科学技术。有时也同群众讨论，但只是徒具形式，或者是先画好框框，加以限制，不是真心依靠群众。在这些地方都是冷冷清清，看不出一点兴旺气象。大凡反其道而行的，就会出现一种新气象。现在许多工厂，在党的领导下，运用了三结合的方法，工人在工艺和设计上提出很多好的创议，做出很多好的产品。这些事实说明，实际经验同理论结合起来，相互补充，相互促进，许多技术上的奥妙，都会迎刃而解。只有这样做，才能使科学技术工作，脱出旧的圈子，走向新的天地。
    在研究设计单位，现在也有一种论调，认为群众运动“哄哄闹闹”，对研究设计工作是无益的。这是一种关门研究论。这样研究和设计出来的东西，很多不是行不通，就是差错百出。更大坏处，就是不能形成大搞研究和设计的声势，一遇困难，便束手无策，一些重要的新产品往往经年累月搞不出来。因此，在研究和设计工作中，也要政治挂帅，依靠群众，把任务交给群众，展开辩论，提倡敢想、敢说、敢干的风格，搞评比，搞运动。这样，许多重型、大型、精密、尖端产品都会出来的。
    任务要排队，产品要成套，材料要立足于国内
    实行任务排队，保证产品成套，搞好材料供应，这三环，对完成明年任务，是十分重要的。
    根据党中央指示的精神，安排生产必须分清缓急主次，实行排队。希望一拥而上，齐头并进，是做不到的。因此，首先要集中力量解决轧钢、矿山、电站设备、机床和主要的交通运输设备。相应地生产石油、水泥、基本化学工业的设备以及配合重工业所必需的轻工业设备。农业方面的需要，除拖拉机、动力机械要适当安排外，其他产品，基本上要依靠县、乡、社人民群众大办工厂，就地解决。
    明年协作配套任务十分繁重。过去在全国范围内，不分大小产品，都实行统一调配，今天看来，这个办法已不能适应新形势。明年必须采取全面规划、重点调配、地区成套、互相支援的办法。重要产品，仍应由中央统一规划、统一分配；一般产品，按大区为单位，进行平衡，逐步建立新的协作配套关系；工业薄弱地区则须外区支援。
    材料供应是明年生产的一个关键。几年来，特别是今年全民炼钢炼铁以来，我国的材料生产，在数量上和品种上，都有了迅速的发展；但在大跃进中，出现了供应紧张的局面。明年机械设备的生产任务，要翻上几番，全年需要的钢材、铜、铝比今年多得多，品种规格要求成套，供应时间又要及时。因此，解决材料问题的途径，除争取进口少数特殊品种外，基本上要立足于国内。这样，才能保证生产的顺利进行。
