    Cold Night by the Pond
    Ge Yuying

    The commune party committee called, ordering us to transport the 30,000 bricks we had already made, requiring us to load the boat and set off overnight to ensure arrival at the county brick factory before 6:00 a.m. Deputy Captain Yu Zhishan was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan after receiving the call. The young and strong laborers had all gone to Wangjia Team to help with wheat planting; 30,000 bricks weighed over 200,000 jin, and we had to load them onto the boat before 1:00 a.m., otherwise, we wouldn't be able to make the 40-plus li journey by 6:00 a.m.
    Yu Zhishan picked up the dirt loudspeaker and shouted throughout the village for a long time, running around and sweating profusely. He thought, this won't work! So he found a few activists to squat by the haystack and discuss it. Some suggested calling back the people who went to Wangjia Team, but Wangjia Team was more than nine li away, and by the time the call went through and they got out of their warm beds and came back, it would take at least an hour or two; some suggested asking for help from brother teams, but the closest was still Wangjia Team.
    Just as they couldn't think of a good solution, a dark figure flashed past the haystack, the lantern in his hand illuminating his dark face, and his thick beard further emphasized his sturdy figure. A cloth belt was tied around his black cotton jacket, with a few fish scales stuck to the end of the belt, and one could tell at a glance that he was a fisherman.
    "Are you here to buy straw?" Someone asked confidently based on experience.
    "No!" The dark figure smiled and said, "We heard your village's loudspeaker shouting loudly from the boat, probably something about a crash project, so we wanted to come and help."
    "Help!" Yu Zhishan's tightly furrowed brows suddenly relaxed. "You don't have anything to do?"
    "There's plenty to do, it's the Great Leap Forward!" The man waved the lantern in his hand and said, "The county aquatic bureau has gathered more than a hundred boats from our production team to collect fish from the pond. We'll start tomorrow, and more than sixty boats have already arrived. Our plan is big, our team will catch 300,000 jin of fish this month..."
    Yu Zhishan couldn't wait for the man to finish, and jumped up with joy, clapping his hands and saying, "Welcome, welcome! Welcome fishermen brothers to help us transport the bricks. The task is urgent, please help organize, and the eight brick piles will form the eight route armies."
    "Hey! There's no need to welcome us, we're doing socialism! Comrade! Lend me the dirt loudspeaker." He shouted a few times with the dirt loudspeaker, and the fishing boats by the river stirred, and the flickering lights reflected in the water, rippling long, bright columns of light. All one could hear was him calling you and you calling him: "Get up, it's time to show the communist spirit of cooperation!"
    "Hurry, don't be downstream..."
    Three gasoline lamps were hung high, illuminating the large threshing ground brightly. People were picking and carrying, moving back and forth like shuttles; although the early winter night was already very cold, everyone was sweating profusely, and enthusiastic labor songs resounded throughout the village, startling the wild ducks nesting in the pond to fly around and squawk.
    Yu Zhishan suddenly remembered something, found the dark figure in the crowd, and asked softly, "I forgot to ask you, do you want wages?"
    "Wages? Huh! How did you come up with that!" The dark figure was a little unhappy at first, but then smiled and said, "Everyone has joined the commune, we're all one family, why talk about wages!"
    The fishermen who were coming and going carrying bricks laughed and said, "If it were for a few coins, even the grandpa couldn't get us out of our warm beds!..."

    荡边寒夜
    葛玉莹
    公社党委打来电话，调运我队已做好的三万砖坯，要我们连夜上船起运，保证明天早晨六点钟以前赶到县窑厂。副队长余志山，接到电话以后急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。青壮年都到王家小队帮助种麦去了；三万砖坯就有二十多万斤重，一定得在下半夜一点钟以前上船，否则，六点钟以前赶不了四十多里路。
    余志山拿起土喇叭满庄叫了好一阵，东跑西奔累得满头大汗，他想这样下去不行！就找了几个积极分子蹲在草堆旁商量。有人主张打电话把去王家队的人调回来，可是王家队离这九里多路，等电话打去再从热被窝里爬起赶回来，起码得个把钟头；有人主张到兄弟队去求援，算来算去最近的还是王家队。
    正想不出好办法，忽然草堆旁闪过一个黑汉子，手里提着的马灯照亮了他黑黑的脸膛，厚厚的络腮胡子更衬托出他结实的身材，黑布袄上束一条布带子，带尾上还粘着几片鱼鳞，一看就知道是个渔民。
    “你是来买草的吗？”不知谁凭着经验满有把握的问。
    “不！”那黑汉子笑笑说：“在船上听到你们庄上喇叭大叫，大概有什么突击工作，我们想来帮忙。”
    “帮忙！”余志山紧皱的眉头刷地舒展开来。“你们没有事吗？”
      “事情可多啦，大跃进嘛！”那人扬扬手里的马灯说：“县水产局把我们一个生产队的一百多号船集中来取荡里的鱼，明天动手，现在已到了六十多号船。我们的计划可大啦，这个月我们队要捕鱼三十万斤……。”
    余志山等不得那人说完，就高兴得跳起来，拍着手说：“欢迎欢迎！欢迎渔民兄弟来帮我们起运砖坯。任务紧急啊，你们帮助组织一下，八个砖坯堆组成八路大军。”
    “哎！谈不上欢迎，干社会主义嘛！同志！把土喇叭借给我。”他用土喇叭大喊了几声，河边的渔船骚动起来了，点点灯光映在水里，漾起长长的明亮的光柱。只听得他喊你，你叫他的：“起来呀，大显共产主义协作精神的时候到啦！”
    “快啊，不要做下游……。”
    三盏汽油灯高高挂起来，照得大片谷场雪亮。人们挑的挑、搬的搬，来来往往穿梭似的；虽然初冬的夜里已经很冷，却个个满头大汗，热情的劳动歌声响遍了村庄，栖息在荡里的野鸭惊得乱飞乱叫。
    余志山突然想起一件事，在人群里找到那个黑汉子，轻轻地问：“我倒忘了问你，你们可要工资？”
    “工资？咦！你咋想得出来的！”那黑汉子开始有点不高兴，后来又笑笑说：“大家都入了公社，一家人嘛，谈什么工资！”
    旁边来往运砖的渔民纷纷笑着说：“要是为了几个钱，太爷也请不动我们出热被窝！……”
