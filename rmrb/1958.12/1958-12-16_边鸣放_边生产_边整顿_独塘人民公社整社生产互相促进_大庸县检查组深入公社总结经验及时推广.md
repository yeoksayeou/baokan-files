Simultaneous Rectification, Production, and Adjustment
    Dutung People's Commune Promotes Mutual Advancement of Rectification and Production
    Dayong County Inspection Team Goes Deep into the Commune to Summarize Experiences and Promote Them in a Timely Manner

    Henan Daily News: In over a month of rectification and consolidation, the Dutung People's Commune in Taikang County has seen even greater leap forward momentum by prominently resolving issues related to ideology, production, and livelihood.

    The Dutung People's Commune demonstrated its great power upon its establishment, but due to the short time since its establishment and the lack of experience among leaders, some problems still existed. In order to rectify, consolidate, and improve the People's Commune, give full play to its greater advantages, and strive for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and other tasks, the county party committee working group and the commune party committee, in accordance with instructions from higher authorities and based on the specific circumstances of the commune, convened branch meetings, management committee meetings, party and Communist Youth League member meetings, and cadre meetings, put forward opinions on rectification, and determined the key points. In terms of method, they adopted the approach of simultaneous meetings, airing of views, production, and rectification, with the spirit of not hindering either rectification or production, so as to achieve rectification promoting production, and production promoting rectification.

    In order to rectify the commune in a planned manner, four steps were taken: First, carry out propaganda, formulate rectification and temporary production plans, organize commune members to air their views, and clarify various legacy issues from the establishment of the commune. Second, rectify organizational structures, rectify the party, the Communist Youth League, and collective welfare undertakings, and improve business management in the commune. Third, establish various systems, handle specific issues, and revise the commune charter. Fourth, formulate long-term plans and comprehensive plans for industrial and agricultural production in 1959, and organize a larger production upsurge.

    Initially, some party members, Communist Youth League members, and cadres did not fully recognize the great significance of rectification and the socialist and communist education movement. In response, meetings of party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, and commune member representatives were convened to organize everyone to study documents, arm their minds, and train propaganda teams. At the same time, the right-leaning conservative and complacent mentality of some cadres was criticized, and individualism and departmentalism were broken down, while socialism and communism were vigorously promoted. Using examples of increased production in summer and autumn, the superiority of the socialist system was emphasized, the great achievements in agriculture over the past year were discussed, and the superiority of the People's Commune was emphasized, to establish confidence and determination in taking the socialist road, paving the way for rectification.

    This commune paid close attention to improving business management and grasping production during rectification and consolidation. Due to the establishment of the People's Commune and the change in organizational forms, the old production management methods were no longer suitable for the new requirements. To this end, the commune, work stations, and production teams all formulated practical production management methods, and implemented a system of "unified planning, quota management, and rewards for overproduction." The production teams also established various specialized teams, and formulated labor discipline: no absenteeism without reason, leave must be requested for absence, obey leadership, abide by labor discipline, production must follow orders, actively engage in labor and production, strive to complete state plans, no shoddy work or cutting corners, cherish public property, and no selfish hoarding, etc. At the beginning of the rectification, labor was rationally arranged according to industrial and agricultural production tasks, such as wheat field management, industrial production, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation, and labor competitions were carried out, with the implementation of appraisal, inspection, and acceptance systems, thereby further improving the production enthusiasm of commune members, and achieving rectification promoting production, further igniting a production upsurge.

    In order to bring financial work onto the right track and serve production, special financial clearing work was carried out. First, the method of simultaneous airing of views, clearing, checking, publicizing, and explaining was adopted to check: fixed assets, inventory materials, cash, creditor's rights and debts, poultry farming, public accumulation, and distribution legacy. The chaotic financial situation was thoroughly clarified, and financial work was basically brought onto a regular footing.

    In order to do a good job in the welfare undertakings centered on the canteen, the commune established a food committee and a food system during rectification. Many canteens, through rectification, basically achieved: satisfaction of patients, satisfaction of children, satisfaction of lying-in women, satisfaction of people with large appetites, satisfaction of guests, satisfaction of cadres, and satisfaction of the elderly. At the same time, 118 nurseries, 78 kindergartens, and 11 shoe factories were established. For example, various welfare organizations at the Maotang Station were comprehensively constructed, and the commune members were very satisfied. The five-guarantee household, old lady Wang Zhangshi, said: "We have established a People's Commune. I have entered a home for the elderly, and they also give me festival allowances during festivals. I must work hard to thank Chairman Mao's good leadership!" Through the great development of welfare undertakings, labor was liberated, promoting a comprehensive leap forward in industry and agriculture.

    This newspaper reports that the Dayong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hunan Province recently organized a appraisal and inspection team composed of cadres from the county, communes, and production brigades to conduct a comprehensive inspection of production management and collective life in the communes, and to summarize, exchange, and promote advanced experiences on the spot, further consolidating and improving the People's Commune and promoting a comprehensive leap forward in winter production.

    In order to earnestly grasp production with one hand and life with the other, from November 26th to 29th, led by Wang Changsheng, the first secretary of the county party committee, nine visiting inspection teams were formed to visit and inspect public canteens, livestock farms, factories, and construction sites in various communes. During the visits, each visiting inspection team used the working method of the mass line, educating cadres and the masses to realize democratic management through forums, and discovering, summarizing, and promoting good typical experiences on the spot. For example, the fifth visiting inspection team found that the canteen of the Guanzhuang team of the Qunli Commune made the masses eat well, eat their fill, and stay warm because they implemented the principle of "large collective, small freedom," and the masses were very satisfied. The county party committee immediately convened an on-site meeting. After visiting and studying, the party committees of each commune convened a life management committee of the public canteen, studied the advanced experience of the Guanzhuang public canteen, and improved the management of the public canteen. Because the public canteen strengthened its management organization, carried out division of labor, and determined special personnel to be responsible, the more than 2,000 mu of vegetables planted by the county's public canteens were cultivated in lush green; the more than 30,000 pigs had dedicated personnel responsible for each pen; and many canteens had flocks of chickens and ducks. When inspecting the diversified operations of various communes, the county party committee visiting inspection team launched a appraisal and competition campaign throughout the county to see who had more business avenues and who had more sideline income. While carrying out this movement, the county party committee inspection teams also helped each production team specifically and comprehensively arrange labor, and improved the organization of the sideline specialized team, so that the sideline team expanded from more than 5,000 people to more than 21,000 people. The original income plan for the Qunli Commune was 170,000 yuan, but after comprehensively arranging labor, vigorously mobilizing the masses, and broadening avenues, carrying out diversified operations, the income could reach more than 300,000 yuan. In addition to the wages and expenses of the commune members, more than 10,000 yuan could be surplus, solving the difficulty of some commune members lacking cotton quilts, and the commune members were satisfied.

    边鸣放  边生产  边整顿
    独塘人民公社整社生产互相促进
    大庸县检查组深入公社总结经验及时推广
    河南日报消息  太康县独塘人民公社在一个多月的整顿和巩固中，由于突出地解决了思想、生产、生活等方面的问题，出现了更大的跃进形势。
    独塘人民公社成立后就显示了巨大威力，但是由于人民公社建成时间短，领导缺乏经验，也还存在一些问题。为了整顿巩固和提高人民公社，发挥人民公社更大的优越性，争取工农业生产等各项工作更大的跃进，县委工作组与公社党委会根据上级指示，结合本社具体情况，召开了支部会、管委会、党团员会、干部会，提出了整社意见，确定了重点。在方法上，运用了边开会、边鸣放、边生产、边整顿的方法，本着整社、生产两不误的精神，作到整社推动生产，生产推动整社。
    为了有计划地把公社整好，采取了四个步骤：第一步，开展宣传，制定整社与临时生产计划，组织社员鸣放，澄清建社中的各种遗留问题。第二步，整顿组织机构，整党整团整顿集体福利事业，改进公社中的经营管理。第三步，建立各种制度，处理具体问题，重新修订社章。第四步，制定远景规划和1959年工农业生产全面规划，组织更大的生产高潮。
    开始，曾有部分的党员、团员和干部，对于整社及社会主义和共产主义教育运动的重大意义认识不足。针对这种情况召开了党员、团员、干部会和社员代表会，组织大家学习文件，武装思想，训练宣传队伍。同时，也批判了部分干部的右倾保守、甘居下游的思想，破除个人主义、本位主义，大立社会主义、共产主义，以夏秋增产的实例，大讲特讲社会主义制度的优越，大讲一年来农业上的伟大成绩，大讲人民公社的优越性，树立走社会主义道路的信心和决心，为整社铺平道路。
    这个社在整顿巩固中，十分注意改进经营管理，抓好生产。由于人民公社的建立，组织形式的改变，旧的生产管理办法已不适应新的要求。为此，公社、作业站、生产队均制定了切实可行的生产管理办法，并实行了“统一计划，定额管理，超产奖励”的制度。生产队又分别建立了各种不同的专业队，制定了劳动纪律：不无故旷工，有事要请假，服从领导，遵守劳动纪律，生产听指挥，积极劳动生产，努力完成国家计划，不偷工不减料，爱护公共财产，不自私多占等。整社开始，根据工农业生产任务，如麦田管理、工业生产、水利建设、积肥等，合理安排劳力，开展劳动竞赛，实行评比、检查验收制，从而更加提高社员生产情绪，达到整社推动生产，进一步掀起生产高潮。
    为使财务工作纳入正轨，达到为生产服务的目的，专门进行了清财工作。首先，采取了边鸣放、边清理、边查对、边公布、边交代的办法查对了：固定财产、库存物资、现金、债权债务、饲养家禽、公共积累、分配遗留，彻底澄清了财务混乱局面，基本上使财务工作走向了正规化。
    为了搞好以食堂为中心的生活福利事业，这个社在整社中建立了伙食委员会和伙食制度，许多食堂通过整顿，基本做到了：病人满意，小孩满意，产妇满意，饭量大的人满意，客人满意，干部满意，老年人满意。同时并建立了托儿所一百一十八处，幼儿园七十八个，制鞋厂十一个。如毛堂站各样福利组织全面进行了建设，社员非常满意，五保户王张氏老大娘说：“成立人民公社中啦，我入了敬老院，过节还发给我过节费，我得好好干活，感谢毛主席的好领导！”通过福利事业的大发展，解放了劳动力，促使工农业全面跃进。
    本报讯  中共湖南省大庸县委最近组织了由县、公社、生产大队干部参加的评比检查组，深入到公社全面地检查生产管理和集体生活，并就地总结交流推广先进经验，进一步巩固提高了人民公社，促使冬季生产全面跃进。
    县委为了认真做到一手抓生产，一手抓生活，11月26日到29日，由县委第一书记王长生领导，组成九个访问检查组，深入到各个公社的公共食堂、畜牧场、工厂、工地进行访问检查。在访问中，各个访问检查组都运用群众路线的工作方法，通过座谈，教育干部和群众实现管理民主化，并就地发现总结推广了好的典型经验。如第五访问检查组发现群力公社官庄队食堂由于贯彻了大集体小自由，使群众吃得好、吃得饱、吃得暖，群众非常满意。县委立即召开了现场会。各公社党委参观学习后，都召开了公共食堂生活管理委员会，研究学习官庄公共食堂的先进经验，改进了公共食堂的管理工作。由于公共食堂健全了管理机构，进行了分工和确定了专人负责，全县公共食堂所种的二千多亩蔬菜，培育得绿油油的；三万多头猪，栏栏都有专人负责；不少的食堂鸡鸭都已成群。县委访问检查组在检查各个公社的多种经营时，在全县开展了一个看谁经营门路多，看谁副业收入大的评比竞赛运动。在开展这一运动的同时，县委各个检查组都帮助各生产队具体全面安排了劳动力，健全组织了副业专业队，使由原来五千多人的副业队伍扩展到二万一千多人。群力公社原来订的收入计划是十七万元，经过全面安排劳力，大力发动群众，广辟门路，开展多种经营，收入可达三十多万元。这些收入除社员工资与开支外还可余万多元，解决了部分社员缺棉被的困难，社员个个满意。
