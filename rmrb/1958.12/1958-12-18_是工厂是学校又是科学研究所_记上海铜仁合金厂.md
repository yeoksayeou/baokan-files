Factory, School, and Scientific Research Institute All in One
    ——A Story of the Shanghai Tongren Alloy Factory
    *People's Daily* reporter
    In mid-August, at the Great Leap Forward Conference of various research institutes in the Shanghai area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, workers from a small factory sent representatives to challenge the most active unit at the conference – the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The challenge letter stated: We want to learn from the scientists who have rich scientific and technological knowledge, and at the same time, we are determined to compete with you in terms of drive and dedication. We will double the number of new products you trial-produce this year. This incident caused a great stir in Shanghai's science and technology circles.

    The factory that dared to challenge the scientists is called the Shanghai Tongren Alloy Factory. The factory has a total of only one hundred and seventy-two employees, most of whom are new workers who have joined the factory successively last year and this year. Their educational level is generally primary and junior high school. Stepping into the gate of the Tongren Factory and seeing the cramped factory buildings squeezed together, as well as the crude equipment made and assembled from old materials or discarded machines from brother factories, some people may be surprised: Is this the factory that has chosen the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, which boasts nationally renowned scientists, strong technical strength, and various advanced equipment, as its competitor?

    However, a thrilling miracle has occurred in this small factory: all the workers, staff, and leading cadres have entered amateur universities and participated in scientific research. Since the beginning of this year, they have successfully trial-produced fifty-nine types of high-grade alloy new products urgently needed for the development of some emerging industries in China, forty of which were independently researched and developed by the workers themselves, and the rest were jointly researched and developed by workers, technicians, and administrative cadres. These products are generally materials that are "embargoed" by American imperialism against our country. Now, this small factory in our country can not only produce them to meet domestic needs, but some products are also sold far abroad, and the quality has caught up with or surpassed the advanced levels of capitalist countries.

    The great achievements of the Tongren Alloy Factory are the result of the entire factory's workers breaking down superstitions and daring to think and act, as well as the result of closely integrating production, scientific research, and learning.

    From the establishment of the Tongren Factory in 1952 to the period of public-private partnership in 1956, it could only produce three products such as Constantan wire. With the rapid development of production and construction, various places demanded some new alloys, and the tasks were pressing. Two engineers researched behind closed doors, but with little effect. Seeing that relying solely on a few technical personnel could not complete the task, the leading cadres decided to send a group of worker activists to the research office. However, at that time, the engineers did not believe that workers could do scientific research, and were even less willing to teach the workers what they knew. He casually picked up a thick chemistry book and said arrogantly: Can you understand this? If you can do it, do it yourself; if you can't, don't touch it! These facts educated the leading cadres and workers. In addition to conducting ideological exchanges with these bourgeois intellectuals in the factory, they began to seriously consider why workers could not be organized to research and trial-produce new products and solve various technical problems in production. The study of the general line of socialist construction further helped them break down superstitions, and worker scientific and technological research groups were established in various workshops and work sections. On the basis of the comprehensive development of mass research activities, workshop laboratories and factory-wide central research groups were also established.

    This new situation of workers engaging in scientific research in conjunction with production raised a key new issue for the Tongren Factory: the need to rapidly improve the workers' cultural, scientific, and technological levels. When the factory's Party branch proposed the idea of establishing an amateur university within the factory in early August, it was immediately warmly welcomed by the employees. Everyone worked together, and the workshop dining hall was transformed into a classroom by hanging a blackboard. Production equipment became teaching tools. According to the method of "you teach me, I teach you, each contributing their strengths, and the able acting as teachers," the Party branch secretary, factory director, technical personnel, department cadres, and experienced workers jointly formed a teaching team. In just four days, without spending a penny, the amateur university was established. According to the factory's current production needs and the direction of future production development, the school established three departments: powder metallurgy, metal smelting and processing, and electrical engineering. All the employees of the factory enrolled in the school. The factory director served as the principal of the school and the leader of the factory-wide central research group, and the workshop director was also the department head and the director of the workshop laboratory.

    The greatest characteristic of this amateur university is that from curriculum setting, teaching content, teaching methods to rules and regulations, it implements the principle of serving production, so that the factory's amateur education is closely integrated with production and scientific research, instead of imitating the set of regular schools away from the actual needs of the factory.

    Among the various courses in the Tongren Factory's amateur university, the course that most directly serves production and has the largest proportion of study hours is the "Research on Production Technology of This Factory" course. The main content of this course is to summarize and exchange the factory's production experience, study ways to improve product quality and output, and mass-produce new alloy products. Its teaching methods are also very flexible. For content applicable to the entire factory, such as important products and their production experience, key technical problems that need to be solved in production, etc., large factory-wide classes are held; small classes are held for what a workshop needs. The production technology research class also often adopts the form of group classes for the research of a certain new product or new technology. Workers gather relevant books and documents in the group, teach and learn from each other, conduct experiments while learning, and solve problems through collective discussion. Many new products and technologies, such as cadmium alloys, copper graphite, and automated presses that increase production efficiency by twenty times, have been researched in this way.

    In order to enable workers to master professional knowledge faster and better, the amateur university attaches great importance to the teaching of basic knowledge. Workers often come into contact with chemistry in the alloy production process, but in the past, many people only knew how to operate and did not understand the principles of various chemical reactions. General chemistry textbooks usually talk about non-metal chemistry first, then metal chemistry, and not much is said about it. The Tongren Factory's amateur university compiles textbooks according to the production characteristics of its own factory, putting the metal part at the front. Among the general metal chemistry knowledge, it focuses on introducing the properties, uses, and extraction methods of metals such as nickel, copper, silver, and tungsten, which are frequently used in the factory's daily production and scientific research, as well as the chemical changes in alloy smelting, etc. Using the method of "eliminating chemistry illiteracy," the chemical names and molecular formulas of various substances are written on the walls of the workshops and on the bottles and boxes containing various real objects. Different chemical equations are also used to write out the chemical changes that occur in equipment such as decomposition furnaces and reduction furnaces, so that workers can learn some of the most basic chemical knowledge anytime, anywhere. Similar methods are also being prepared for teaching basic courses such as physics and mathematics.

    The political class of the amateur university has become the position for the factory's Party branch to conduct communist ideological education and publicize the Party's policies and guidelines to the entire factory. Current political struggles and major issues in the ideological understanding of employees are all used as the central content of the political class, and are resolved through lectures, airing of views, and debates.

    Now, the Tongren Factory is boiling with a wave of great technical revolution, cultural revolution, and fierce attack on cutting-edge technologies. Workers spend more than three hours of their spare time every day on learning and scientific research. They not only know how to operate, but also want to know why they do it; not only understand the current production, but also actively consider future production, to better meet the needs of the country in terms of variety, quality, and output. Li Wanlin and more than a dozen workers in the smelting section of the metal smelting and processing workshop, after work, do not go to class or review their lessons, but do research work in the workshop and workshop laboratory, and often seize the more than ten minutes of production gap time after each feeding and before starting the furnace to read books and discuss problems. In this way, they have successively trial-produced twenty-one high-grade alloy products in the recent three months. Wang Tongxing, a young worker who transferred to the factory only a year ago, boldly overturned the formula and process conditions that the engineer had failed to research, and after countless failures and the inspiration of Soviet professional books, he finally successfully trial-produced seamless nickel tubes, an indispensable material in the electronic tube industry, and six other types of seamless alloy tubes. He also used electrolysis instead of chemical methods to trial-produce silver powder and nickel powder with higher efficiency and lower cost. Because production, scientific research, and education are completely integrated, a new situation has now emerged in this factory, which is a factory, a school, and a scientific research institute. The workers are also gradually becoming a new type of laborer who are workers, students, and scientific researchers.

    The Tongren Alloy Factory has decided that within about four years, more than 90% of the employees who meet the learning conditions (under the age of forty-five) will graduate from the amateur university. After heated discussions throughout the factory, five graduation standards for the amateur university were set: 1. Complete the production tasks for each quarter; 2. Independently create and collectively research ten projects of technological innovation to increase production efficiency by more than one time; 3. Independently create and collectively research five new products; 4. Independently create and collectively research three items to improve product quality to international standards; 5. Write a scientific paper with practical experience and theoretical basis. (Attached picture)

    是工厂是学校又是科学研究所
    ——记上海铜仁合金厂
    本报记者
    8月中旬，在中国科学院上海地区各研究所跃进大会上，一个小厂的工人们派来代表，向大会上最活跃的一个单位——中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所提出了挑战。挑战书上说：我们要向有丰富科学技术知识的科学家们学习，同时决心和你们比一比干劲和钻劲。你们今年试制多少种新产品，我们一定要翻一番。这件事在上海科学技术界引起了很大的震动。
    敢于向科学家们挑战的这家工厂叫做上海铜仁合金厂，全厂职工一共只有一百七十二人，其中大部分是去年和今年陆续来厂的新工人，文化程度一般是小学和初中。踏进铜仁厂的大门，看到那些挤在一起的狭小厂房，以及那些利用旧材料或兄弟厂报废机器自制和装配的简陋设备，也许有人会大吃一惊：挑选那拥有全国知名的科学家、雄厚的技术力量和各种先进设备的冶金陶瓷研究所作为竞赛对手的，就是这样一个工厂么？
    可是，就在这家小厂里出现了令人振奋的奇迹：全厂工人、职员和领导干部，人人进了业余大学，个个参加科学研究，今年以来，已经试制成功无缝镍管、银钨合金等五十九种为发展我国一些新兴工业所迫切需要的高级合金新产品，其中四十种由工人们自己独立研究成功，其余的一部分也是工人、技术人员和行政干部合作研究成功的。这些产品一般都是美帝国主义对我国“禁运”的物资，现在我国这样一家小厂不仅能生产出来供应国内的需要，有些产品还远销国外，质量已经赶上或超过了资本主义国家的先进水平。
    铜仁合金厂的巨大成就是全厂职工大破迷信，敢想敢做的结果，也是将生产、科学研究和学习密切结合起来的结果。
    铜仁厂在1952年建厂至1956年公私合营期间，只能生产康铜丝等三种产品，随着生产建设的迅速发展，各地都要求一些新的合金，任务逼得很紧。两个工程师关门研究，成效很少。眼看单纯依靠少数技术人员完不成任务，领导干部决心派出一批工人积极分子到研究室，但是，当时工程师不相信工人能做科学研究，更不大愿意把自己会的东西教给工人。他随手拿起一本厚厚的化学书，傲慢地说：你们看得懂吗？能搞就自己搞，不能搞就不要碰！这些事实教育了领导干部和工人。他们除了和厂里这些资产阶级知识分子进行思想交锋以外，开始认真地考虑到工人为什么不能组织起来研究试制新产品、解决生产上的各种技术问题呢？社会主义建设总路线的学习更帮助他们打破迷信，各车间、工段纷纷成立了工人科学技术研究小组。在群众性研究活动全面展开的基础上，又成立了车间试验室和全厂性的中心研究组。
    工人结合生产大搞科学研究这一新形势，向铜仁厂提出了一个关键性的新问题：需要迅速地提高工人的文化科学技术水平。8月初，工厂党支部提出全厂内创办一所业余大学的主张时，立刻受到职工们的热烈欢迎。大家一起动手，车间饭堂挂上黑板就成了教室，生产设备当了教学工具。按照你教我，我教你，各尽所长、能者为师的办法，党支部书记、厂长、技术人员、科室干部和有经验的工人共同组成了一支教师队伍。短短四天内，一文钱也没花，就把业余大学办起来了。根据工厂当前生产需要和今后生产发展的方向，学校设立了粉末冶金、金属冶炼加工、电机三个系。全厂职工都入了学。厂长担任了学校校长和全厂中心研究组组长，车间主任也就是系主任和车间试验室主任。
    这所业余大学最大的特色，就是从课程设置、教学内容、教法到规章制度，都贯彻着为生产服务的方针，使全厂的业余教育和生产、科学研究密切结合成为一体，而不是离开工厂实际需要去模仿正规学校的一套。
    在铜仁厂业余大学的各种课程中，最直接地为生产服务、学时比重最大的一种课程，是“本厂生产技术研究”课。这课程的主要内容就是总结和交流全厂生产经验，研究提高产品质量、产量的办法和大量试制新的合金产品。它的教学方法也是非常灵活的，适用于全厂的内容，如重要产品及其生产经验、生产上需要解决的关键技术问题等等，上全厂性大课；一个车间需要的就上小课。生产技术研究课还经常针对某一项新产品、新技术的研究，采取小组课的方式。工人们在小组内集中起有关的各种书籍、文献，互教互学，边学边做试验，有问题集体讨论解决。镉合金、铜石墨、提高生产效率二十倍的自动化压机等许多新产品、新技术，都是这样研究出来的。
    为了使工人更快更好地掌握专业知识，业余大学很重视基础知识的教学。工人们在合金生产过程中常常接触到化学，可是过去很多人只会操作，不懂各种化学反应的道理。而一般化学教材都是先讲非金属的化学，后讲金属化学，而且讲得不多。铜仁厂业余大学根据自己工厂的生产特点编写教材，把金属部分调到前面来，在一般金属化学知识中，又着重介绍本厂每天生产和科学研究中经常用到的镍、铜、银、钨等金属的性能、用途和提取的方法，合金熔炼中化学变化过程等等。他们用“扫化学盲”的方法在车间的墙上，装着各种实物的瓶子、箱子上，都写出这种物质的化学名称和分子式，分解炉、还原炉等设备上还用不同的化学方程式写出这里发生的化学变化过程，让工人随时随地学到一些最基本的化学知识。类似的办法还准备用到物理、数学等基础课的教学上。
    业余大学的政治课成了工厂党支部对全厂进行共产主义思想教育和宣传党的方针政策的阵地，当前的政治斗争和职工思想认识中的重大问题，都作为政治课的中心内容，通过讲授、鸣放、辩论加以解决。
    现在，铜仁厂到处沸腾着大闹技术革命、文化革命、猛攻尖端技术的热潮。工人们每天有三小时以上的业余时间用在学习和科学研究上，他们不仅会操作，还要知道为什么要这样做，不仅要懂得当前的生产，还要主动考虑今后的生产，要从品种、质量、产量各方面更好地满足国家的需要。金属冶炼加工车间冶炼工段李万林等十几个工人，下班后不是上课，复习功课，就是在车间和车间试验室里做研究工作，还经常抓紧每次下料后开炉前十多分钟的生产空隙时间看书和讨论问题。就这样，他们在最近的三个月中先后试制出二十一种高级合金产品。一年前才转业来的青年工人王同兴，大胆地推翻了工程师研究失败的配方和工艺条件，经过无数次失败的摸索，和苏联专业书籍的启发，终于把电子管工业中不可缺少的材料无缝镍管和另外六种无缝合金管试制成功，他还用电解法代替化学方法试制出了效率更高，成本更低的银粉和镍粉。由于生产、科学研究和教育完全打成一片，现在，这个厂已经出现了一个是工厂、学校，又是科学研究所的新局面，而工人们也逐渐成为是工人、学生，又是科学研究员的新型劳动者了。
    铜仁合金厂已经作出决定，在四年左右的时间内，全厂90％以上具有学习条件的职工（年龄在四十五岁以下）都要在业余大学毕业。业余大学的毕业标准，经过全厂的热烈讨论订出了五条：一、完成每季度的生产任务；二、独创和集体研究技术革新提高生产效率一倍以上的项目十件；三、独创和集体研究新产品五件；四、独创和集体研究提高产品质量达国际水平的三件；五、写出有实际经验和理论根据的科学论文一篇。（附图片）
    铜仁合金厂熔炼车间工人研究小组自己找到了新锰铜的配方，这种配方可以完全不含镍，这对我国节约宝贵而缺乏的镍有重要意义。  新华社记者  陈娟美摄
