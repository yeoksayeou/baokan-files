Beijing Publishing Houses
Are About to Publish a Batch of New Books

    In order to help the broad masses of readers better study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Publishing House, the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House, and the China Youth Publishing House are now concentrating their efforts to publish a batch of reading materials elucidating the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session.
    The People's Publishing House has decided to take the propaganda of rural people's communes as one of the important tasks in 1959. At present, the editorial department has formulated a batch of economic topics, including works elucidating major theoretical issues in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as books introducing typical experiences in consolidating and developing people's communes. The main topics are: The great historical significance of the people's commune, the guiding principles and tasks of the people's commune in developing production, the financial and trade system of the people's commune, the industrialization of the people's commune, the commodity production of the people's commune, the production and distribution of the people's commune, the accumulation and consumption of the people's commune, on the distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system, on the ways of transitioning from rural people's communes to ownership by the whole people, the collectivization of life in the people's commune, and the comprehensive organization of the people's production and life by the people's commune, etc. Most of these topics have already been commissioned to authors and will be published successively soon.
    The Popular Reading Materials Publishing House will publish some popular reading materials, such as "Popular Talks on the Guiding Principles and Policies of People's Communes," "How to Consolidate and Develop People's Communes," such as "The Production and Management Guiding Principles of People's Communes," "Distribution According to Labor and Distribution According to Need," "Collective Welfare Undertakings of People's Communes," "How People's Communes Implement Democratic Centralism," and "How to Do a Good Job in the Operation and Management of People's Communes," some of which have already been commissioned to authors for rush writing, and some have already been submitted. Some of these books will be published successively in January 1959, and the remaining books will also be published successively in the first quarter of 1959.
    The China Youth Publishing House will successively publish some books in the first quarter of next year to help the broad masses of young people study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session. The main ones are: 1. "Talks on Socialism and Communism." 2. "How to Conduct Socialist and Communist Education in Rural Areas."
    In addition, they will also edit and publish two reading materials to assist young people in studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session and other related documents. One is an auxiliary reading material for studying the theory of communism by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the other is an auxiliary reading material for studying several economic issues in China's socialist construction.

    The Academy of Building Sciences is Preparing to Hold a Special Academic Discussion
    Nearly a hundred researchers from the three research offices of the Academy of Building Sciences of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, including regional and urban planning, and students from the Department of Economic Geography of the Normal University, formed eleven working groups in early November and went to Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, Southwest China, Guangxi, Shandong and other places to study the planning, construction, and design of people's communes. The main issues they studied in the planning of people's communes were: how to adapt to the requirements of "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers" and "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery," so as to facilitate people's production and life, and to facilitate centralized leadership and democratic management; how to reflect the elimination of the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and manual and mental labor, so that the countryside gradually becomes urbanized; and issues such as the planning of agricultural mechanization, factoryization, and landscaping. The architectural design issues include: how to design residences suitable for the reunion of each family, men, women, old and young, and to facilitate mass life; the form, standards, and layout of public welfare buildings such as public canteens, kindergartens, nursing homes, shops, and hospitals, and how to facilitate people's work and life. Now, the work of these eleven groups has come to an end, and they are summarizing and evaluating the design schemes, and are preparing to hold a special academic conference in the near future to conduct academic discussions, so as to correctly implement the spirit of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    The Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Wrote a Paper on People's Communes
    The Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has successively organized four commune issue investigation groups, which went to people's communes in Beijing, Xushui in Hebei, Zhengzhou in Henan and other places for investigation and research.
    After the investigation and research work of each investigation group was completed, the comrades of each group separately determined topics to write papers. The contents of these papers include: the nature, tasks, organizational form, scale system, organizational structure, and its working methods; political work after the establishment of the commune; the impact of communization on China's state system, legal system, and social system, the ownership system and distribution system of the commune, etc. Now, the first drafts of these papers have been written and are being revised in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
