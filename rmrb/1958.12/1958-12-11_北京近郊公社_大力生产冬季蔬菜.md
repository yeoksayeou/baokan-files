Xinhua News Agency report: The people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are striving to produce more vegetables to supply the capital's market. Many communes are responding to the call of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and are preparing to utilize all the hotbeds used for raising seedlings to plant another crop of vegetables.

This winter, the production of greenhouse and hotbed vegetables in the suburbs of Beijing has seen significant development and improvement. The number of greenhouses has increased by more than 50% compared to last year, hotbeds have increased by more than 10,000, root crop acreage has increased by 10,000 mu, and windbreak land has increased by more than 4,000 mu. The varieties produced include spinach, rapeseed, celery, tomatoes, cucumbers, and eggplants.

An important improvement in greenhouse production in the suburbs this year is the promotion of solar greenhouses. These greenhouses, which save coal, labor, and are relatively low in cost, have grown to more than 4,200. Currently, the first crop of tomatoes from the greenhouses is being marketed successively, and green leeks and garlic sprouts have also begun to be harvested. Hotbed production has also seen many improvements this year. Some people's communes have simplified the technique of pulling and covering reed mats, which has improved the heat preservation and cold protection of the hotbeds. Many communes have changed small plots to large connected plots, expanding the cultivated area.

    北京近郊公社
    大力生产冬季蔬菜
    据新华社讯  北京近郊各人民公社争取生产更多的蔬菜，供应首都市场。不少公社响应中共北京市委的号召，准备把育苗用的阳畦全部利用起来，赶种一茬菜。
    北京郊区今年冬季的温室和阳畦蔬菜生产有了很大的发展和改进。温室间数比去年增加50％以上，阳畦增加一万多畦，根茬菜增加一万亩，风障地增加四千多亩。生产的品种有菠菜、油菜、芹菜、西红柿、黄瓜和茄子等。
    今年郊区温室生产中的一项重要改进是推广了日光温室。这种省煤、省劳动力，成本也较低的温室已发展到四千二百多间。目前温室第一茬西红柿正在陆续上市，青韭、蒜黄也开始收割。阳畦生产今年也有很多改进。有的人民公社简化了拉盖蒲席的技术，提高了阳畦保温防寒作用。许多公社把小畦改成大联畦，扩大了栽培面积。
