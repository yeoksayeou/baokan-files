Correctly Understand the Current Situation of Socialist Construction

The timing of the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people depends on the level of production development and the level of people's awareness, which are objective realities, and cannot be dictated by people's subjective wishes. Therefore, this transition can only be realized in stages and batches across the country after a considerable period of time. If we fail to see this, confuse the establishment of communes with the realization of ownership by the whole people, are too impatient, attempt to prematurely negate collective ownership in rural areas, and rush to change it to ownership by the whole people, then it is also inappropriate and therefore impossible to succeed.

The transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people is not the same as the transition from socialism to communism. The transformation of agricultural production cooperatives into people's communes is even less equal to the transition from socialism to communism. The transition from socialism to communism requires a much longer time than the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people.

—Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes

Communism Standard Should Never Be Lowered

The sixth issue of "Ideological Front" published a commentary entitled "Correctly Understand the Current Situation of Socialist Construction in Our Country." The commentary said that since the Great Leap Forward, some communist sprouts have emerged in our society. People are jubilant and full of energy, hoping to build socialism and move towards communism as soon as possible. It is certainly a good thing that people have shown great enthusiasm for communism and that communist thought is generally on the rise. However, in the propaganda, many people's understanding of some issues, especially some theoretical issues, is still very vague. After the realization of people's communes, some people thought that the current people's communes are already owned by the whole people; many people's communes have implemented free meals, and some people thought that communism has begun; therefore, in their opinion, it seems that we are now transitioning to a communist society.

The commentary said that socialist society and communist society are two stages of a society, which are closely related but also different. The basis of both is the social public ownership of the means of production. However, the former is the primary stage, implementing the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work"; the latter is the advanced stage, implementing the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." At the same time, in socialist society, a large number of communist factors will inevitably be generated; gradually developing these factors will prepare conditions for the future transition from socialist society to communist society.

At present, we are still building a socialist society, and we must transition to a communist society in the future. This is the inevitable trend of historical development. However, in our society now, there are still two forms of ownership of the means of production, namely socialist collective ownership and socialist ownership by the whole people. Our production is not very developed, and our culture is still relatively backward. Therefore, our main task at present is to develop social productive forces at a high speed, so that socialist collective ownership will gradually transition to socialist ownership by the whole people, and build a socialist society.

The commentary said that after pointing out that our main task at present is to build socialism, rather than immediately transition to communism: Although we have taken many measures in the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of continuous revolution, such as "two participations, one reform" in enterprises, the combination of education and productive labor, the industrialization of communes, and the factoryization of agriculture, we have begun to gradually eliminate the three differences and break down some bourgeois rights. However, as mentioned above, the level of our social productive forces is not high, and products are not abundant, especially since there are still two forms of ownership of the means of production. It can be seen that, as the main task of a certain period, what we face is, first of all, a transition from the current revolutionary stage to the building of a socialist society—that is, a transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. Only after completing this transition can we gradually transition from socialist society to communist society.

The commentary concluded by saying that proposing such two transitions, explaining the reasons, and making the masses clearly see the two goals of struggle and understand that they should take two steps instead of one, will not only not damage the enthusiasm of the masses, but will also better发挥the communist enthusiasm of the masses. What is particularly important is that the proposal of such two transitions will neither lower the standard of communism nor lower the standard of socialism. This can greatly clarify some current confused thoughts, so that our vast number of cadres can better发挥their enthusiasm.

Don't Get a Chronic Disease, and Don't Get an Acute Disease

The fifth issue of "Emptiness and Reality" published Zhong Chengzhang's article "We Must Correctly View Communism." The article said that the combination of the socialist system and communist factors is the basic characteristic of current social life. In such a situation, real life poses the question of how to correctly view communism to us. At present, among some people, there are two different deviations on this issue: one is that their thinking lags behind reality and they are suffering from a right-leaning conservative chronic disease; the other is that their thinking exceeds reality and they are suffering from a blind-acting acute disease. People suffering from chronic diseases are out of touch with social practice, their thinking becomes rigid, they cannot deeply feel the pulse of the times, and they are always indifferent to the communist sprouts that are emerging. They do not actively support its development. This attitude is very wrong. People suffering from acute diseases take communism very lightly. They see that communes have been established in rural areas, public canteens have been set up, and homes for the elderly and nurseries have been established, and they think that communism has arrived. Some people, although they understand that it is not yet communism, think that they are already standing next to the gate of communism and can reach the ideal state of communism in one or two years. This view is obviously wrong.

The article focused on criticizing those with acute illness who deny the positive significance of distribution according to work at present, and deny that commodities and currency still need to exist. The article believes that today, when products are not very abundant and cannot fully meet people's various needs, distribution cannot be carried out according to needs. Only distribution basically according to the quantity and quality of labor is reasonable. The abolition of commodity and currency circulation is only possible under the conditions of highly developed productive forces. Today, the issue is not to abolish commodity circulation, but to develop commodity circulation. In the relationship between accumulation and consumption, if the accumulation part is too large, so that it affects the improvement of people's living standards, it will reduce people's enthusiasm for production and ultimately hinder the development of production, which is not conducive to socialist construction. The article concluded by saying that socialism and communism are a lower stage and a higher stage, so there are differences between the two. The task at the present stage is to develop social productive forces at a high speed, gradually transition socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, build socialism, and then transition to communism on this basis. Of course, there is a connection between the two. Building socialism creates conditions for realizing communism, and realizing communism is the inevitable trend of socialist development. We must not only see the current conditions, but also see the future prospects. When doing today's work, we must consider tomorrow's tasks, strengthen communist ideological education in our work, and actively support all communist sprouts.

To Build Socialism Requires Arduous Efforts

The seventh issue of the "Yangtze River" semi-monthly刊登published Song Kanfu's "Several Issues Concerning Socialist and Communist Education." When the author talked about the current situation of building socialism, he said: The results of practice in the past year tell us that the speed of socialist construction is much faster than previously expected, and the arrival of communist society is not a distant future thing. Therefore, the historical task before us is to accelerate socialist construction and actively create conditions and lay the foundation for the transition to communist society.

The article said: At present, we are building socialism, but at the same time we are creating conditions for the transition to communism. Socialism already contains the seeds of communism. The coherence and connection between the two, and the boundaries and differences between the two, tell us that we cannot separate them or confuse them. This is the inevitable road of social development and the inevitable phenomenon that conforms to the laws of social development. Therefore, any practice and idea that wants to skip over the current stage, stay at the current stage, or confuse the two, or separate the two completely, is not in line with the objective laws of the historical development of society.

Our direction and purpose are clear. We must also follow the specific road of social development forward. We must clearly examine reality, admit reality, and neither be satisfied with nor stay at the current level. We must grasp the objective laws to transform reality,发挥subjective initiative, and accelerate the speed of transforming reality as much as possible. We must not deviate from objective reality, nor can we skip over every necessary stage in the road of objective reality development.

The article concluded by saying: The Great Leap Forward showed the possibility of building socialism at high speed and developing productive forces at high speed. However, there is still a process of arduous efforts to achieve the building of socialism. Our direction is clear, our will is unwavering, and the road to this goal is very clear. Mastering the laws of social development can master one's own destiny, so that one has a clear understanding and becomes the master of destiny, not a slave of destiny. One can发挥subjective initiative and understand how to use power, and understand how to mobilize and use all positive factors and favorable conditions. In this way, we will not simply accommodate reality, accommodate backwardness, and stick to old rules, nor will we be impatient and rash, arrogant and complacent. We will not make or make fewer mistakes of blindness or right-leaning conservatism.

### 正确认识当前社会主义建设的形势

专栏：在理论刊物上

    正确认识当前社会主义建设的形势
    集体所有制向全民所有制过渡的迟早，取决于生产发展的水平和人民觉悟的水平这些客观存在的形势，而不能听凭人们的主观愿望，想迟就迟，想早就早。因此，这个过渡只有经过一个相当长的时间，才能在全国范围内分期分批地实现。如果看不到这些，把成立公社和实现全民所有制混为一谈，过于性急，企图在农村中过早地否定集体所有制，匆忙地改变为全民所有制，那也是不适当的，因而是不可能成功的。
    由社会主义的集体所有制变为社会主义的全民所有制，并不等于由社会主义变为共产主义。农业生产合作社变为人民公社，更不等于由社会主义变为共产主义。由社会主义变为共产主义，比由社会主义的集体所有制变为社会主义的全民所有制，需要经过更长得多的时间。
                   ——关于人民公社若干问题的决议
  共产主义标准决不应该降低
      “思想战线”第六期发表了题为“正确认识我国当前社会主义建设的形势”的评论，评论说，大跃进以来，我国社会中出现了一些共产主义的萌芽。人们欢欣鼓舞，干劲冲天，盼望早日建成社会主义，奔向共产主义。人们对共产主义表现了很大的积极性，共产主义的思想普遍高涨，当然是好事情。但是，在宣传当中，不少人在有些问题上面，特别是在有些理论问题上面，认识还很模糊。人民公社化实现以后，有人就以为目前的人民公社已经是全民所有制了；许多人民公社实行了吃饭不要钱，有人就以为是开始实行共产主义了；因而，在他们看来，好像我们现在就是向共产主义社会过渡了。
    评论说，社会主义社会和共产主义社会是一个社会的两个阶段，两者之间是密切联系而又相互区别的。两者的基础都是生产资料的社会公有制。但前者是初级阶段，实行“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则；后者是高级阶段，实行“各尽所能，按需分配”的原则。同时，在社会主义社会里，必然会产生大量的共产主义的因素；逐步地发展这种因素，就会为将来社会主义社会向共产主义社会过渡准备条件。
    目前，我们还正在建设社会主义社会，将来一定要过渡到共产主义社会，这是历史发展的必然趋势。但是，现在在我们的社会里面，还有两种生产资料的所有制，即社会主义的集体所有制和社会主义的全民所有制，我们的生产还不很发达，文化还比较落后。因此，我们当前的主要任务，就是要高速度地发展社会生产力，使社会主义的集体所有制逐步地过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，建成社会主义社会。
    评论在指出我们目前的主要任务是建成社会主义，而不是立即向共产主义过渡之后说：我们虽然根据毛泽东同志不断革命理论的精神，已经采取了许多措施，例如：企业中的“两参一改”、教育与生产劳动相结合、公社工业化、农业工厂化等，开始逐步地消灭三个差别，破除一部分资产阶级法权，但是，如前所述，我们的社会生产力的水平还不高，产品还不丰富，特别是还有两种生产资料的所有制。由此可见，作为一定时期的主要任务来说，在我们面前，首先要经过一个由现时的革命阶段到建成社会主义社会——即由集体所有制到全民所有制的过渡。只有完成了这个过渡，我们才可以逐步地由社会主义社会向共产主义社会过渡。
    评论最后说，提出这样的两个过渡，说明道理，使群众明确地看到了两个奋斗目标，懂得了应该两步走而不是一步走，这不但不会损伤群众的积极性，而且会更好地发挥群众的共产主义的积极性。特别重要的，是提出这样的两个过渡，既不至于降低共产主义的标准，也不至于降低社会主义的标准。这就可以大大地澄清当前的某些混乱思想，从而使我们的广大干部能够更好地发挥自己的积极性。
  不要犯慢性病  也不要犯急性病
    “虚与实”第五期上，发表了钟成章的“必须正确看待共产主义”一文。文章说，社会主义制度加共产主义因素，是目前社会生活的基本特点。在这样的形势下，现实生活向我们提出了如何正确看待共产主义的问题。现在，在有些人中间，对于这个问题存在着两种不同的偏向，一种是思想落后于实际，害了右倾保守的慢性病；一种是思想超过了实际，害了盲目行事的急性病。患有慢性病的人脱离了社会实践，思想发生僵化，不能深切的感受时代的脉搏，对于正在冒出头来的共产主义的幼芽总是无动于衷，不去积极支持它的发展，这种态度是十分错误的，患有急性病的人，把共产主义看得十分轻而易举。他们看见农村中建立了公社，办起了公共食堂，设立了敬老院、托儿所等，就以为共产主义已经到来了。也有些人虽然懂得现在还不是共产主义，但却认为已经站在共产主义的大门旁了，只要一、二年就能达到共产主义的理想境界。这种看法显然是不对的。
    文章侧重批判了急性病者否认按劳分配在目前的积极意义，否认商品和货币还有存在的必要，文章认为在今天产品还不很丰富，不能充分满足人们的各种需要的情况下，就不能按需要来进行分配，只有基本上按照劳动的数量和质量来进行分配才是合理的。关于商品和货币流通的废除，也只有在生产力高度发展的条件下才有可能，今天的问题不是废除商品流通而是要发展商品流通，在积累与消费的关系上如果积累部分搞得过大，以至影响到人民生活水平的提高，就会降低人民的生产积极性，结果反而妨碍生产的发展，对社会主义建设不利。文章最后说，社会主义和共产主义，一个是低级阶段，一个是高级阶段，因此两者是有区别的。现阶段的任务是高速度地发展社会生产力，逐步地使社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，建成社会主义，然后再在这基础上过渡到共产主义。当然，两者之间是有联系的，建设社会主义是为实现共产主义创造条件，实现共产主义是社会主义发展的必然趋势。我们既要看到现在的条件，又看到未来的远景，在做着今天的工作的时候，就要考虑明天的任务，在工作中加强共产主义的思想教育，积极扶植一切共产主义的幼芽。
  建成社会主义  尚须艰苦努力
    “长江”半月刊第七期上刊登了宋侃夫的
  “关于社会主义、共产主义教育的几个问题”的文章，作者谈到了目前建设社会主义的形势时说：一年来实践的结果告诉我们：社会主义建设的速度，比以前预料的要快的多，共产主义社会的到来，并不是遥远将来的事情了。因此，摆在我们面前的历史任务，既要加速社会主义建设，同时又要积极地为过渡到共产主义社会创造条件，奠定基础。
    文章说：当前，我们是为了建成社会主义，但同时也是为了过渡到共产主义创造条件。社会主义就已经孕育了共产主义的萌芽。两者的连贯性和联系性，两者的界限和差别，就告诉我们既不能把它分割开来，也不能混同起来。这是社会发展必经的道路，是合乎社会发展规律的必然现象。因此，想逾越过目前这个阶段，想停留在目前阶段，或者是把两者混淆起来，或者是把两者截然分开的一切作法和想法，都是不符合社会的历史发展的客观规律的。
    我们的方向和目的是明确的。我们还必须遵循着社会发展的具体的道路前进。要清楚的审视现实，承认现实，既不应当满足于也不应当停留在现实水平上，要掌握客观规律改造现实，发挥主观能动作用，尽可能加快改造现实的速度。也不能离开客观现实，不能逾越客观现实发展道路上的每个必经阶段。
    文章最后说：大跃进显示了高速度建设社会主义、高速度地发展生产力的可能性，但是，达到建成社会主义还有一段艰苦努力的过程。我们的方向是明确的，意志是坚定不移的，走向这个目的的道路是很清楚的。掌握了社会发展的规律就能掌握自己的命运，使自己心中有数，成为命运的主人，而不是命运的奴隶，就能够发挥主观能动作用，懂得如何使用力量，懂得如何调动和使用一切积极因素和有利条件。这样，我们就不会一味迁就现实，迁就落后，墨守陈规，也不会急燥冒进，骄傲自满。就能不犯或少犯盲目性或右倾保守的错误。
