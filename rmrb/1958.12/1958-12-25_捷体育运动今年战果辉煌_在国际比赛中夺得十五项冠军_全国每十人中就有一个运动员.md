Xinhua News Agency, Prague (Reporter Yang Yi): Czechoslovak athletes have broken 178 national records this year and won fifteen championships and eleven second places for the country in international competitions.

In ball sports, the Czechoslovak men's team won the European Volleyball Championship, held in Prague in August with the participation of twenty countries, for the third time. The women's team was second only to the Soviet Union by one game, taking the silver medal.

Czechoslovak players Štipek and Vinařovský were the men's doubles champions at the first European Table Tennis Championships held in Hungary this year, and the men's team also took second place in the men's team event at the competition.

At the 14th World Gymnastics Championships in Moscow, the famous Czechoslovak athlete Bosáková won two world titles in floor exercise and balance beam, and was also the all-around runner-up.

In addition, Czechoslovak athletes also won four first places in European skating competitions and international motorcycle races.

The great achievements of Czechoslovak sports are inseparable from the long-term care of the Czechoslovak Communist Party for sports and the broad mass base of national sports activities. In Czechoslovakia, about one in ten people is an athlete. Among the country's 13 million people, there are 20,000 soccer teams and more than 200,000 amateur soccer players. The upcoming Second National Games (to be held in 1960) will have 660,000 participants in various competitions.

    捷体育运动今年战果辉煌
    在国际比赛中夺得十五项冠军
    全国每十人中就有一个运动员
    据新华社布拉格电  记者杨翊报道：捷克斯洛伐克的运动员今年一共刷新了一百七十八项全国纪录，并且在国际比赛中为国家赢得十五项冠军和十一项亚军。
    球类运动方面，今年8月在布拉格举行的有二十个国家参加的欧洲排球锦标赛中，捷克斯洛伐克男子队第三次获得冠军，女子队仅以一场之差次于苏联，而列居亚军。
    捷选手斯蒂佩克和维纳诺夫斯基是今年在匈牙利举行的第一届欧洲乒乓球锦标赛的男子双打冠军，男子队还取得了这次竞赛的男子团体第二名。
    在莫斯科举行第十四届世界体操比赛中，捷著名运动员博萨科娃获得自由体操和平衡木两项世界冠军和全能亚军。
    此外在欧洲滑冰比赛和国际摩托车比赛中，捷选手们也赢得了四个第一名。
    捷克斯洛伐克体育运动所以取得这样巨大的成果是同捷克斯洛伐克共产党长期以来对体育事业的关怀和全国体育活动一向具有广泛的群众基础分不开的。在捷克斯洛伐克，大约十个人中就有一个运动员，全国一千三百万人中有两万个足球队和二十多万业余足球运动员。目前正在准备中的第二届全国体育运动大会（1960年举行）将有六十六万人参加各项竞赛。
