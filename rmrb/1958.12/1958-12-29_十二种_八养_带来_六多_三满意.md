    This newspaper reports: In the year of the Great Leap Forward, the CCP Wu Xiang County Committee of Shanxi Province, based on the leadership method of overall consideration, rational arrangement, guaranteeing the center, and comprehensive development, led the masses to carry out the "Twelve Plantings" and "Eight Rearing" movements, vigorously developing diversified economy, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery.
    This year, Wu Xiang County achieved a great bumper harvest in diversified economy. The county's grain output increased by 2.8 times compared to last year; oil crops, cotton, hemp, and vegetables increased by one to seven times compared to last year; 87.77 million trees were planted, an increase of 377 times compared to last year; by the end of October, the county's pigs had grown to more than 70,000 heads, an increase of more than 2.2 times compared to last year, with an average of two pigs per household; large livestock increased by 13% compared to last year; sheep grew to 150,000, an increase of 51% compared to last year; chickens grew to 280,000, with an average of two chickens per person; the county's people had never had the habit of raising fish or rabbits in the past, but this year they also developed 2,100 rabbits and 50,000 fish; the development of various local and special products and wild plants has also exceeded any period in history.
    Before the Great Leap Forward, the Wu Xiang County, due to the long-term self-sufficient economic viewpoint of the leadership, the diversified economy in the rural areas could not be fully developed, resulting in a lack of collective production funds, which could not be well expanded for reproduction, and the lack of pocket money for the commune members. After entering the Great Leap Forward last winter, after investigation, research, and consultation with the masses, in April of this year, the county party committee proposed to carry out the "Twelve Plantings" and "Eight Rearing" movements with overall consideration, rational arrangement, and centering on industrial and agricultural production, which enabled the county to achieve an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. The twelve plantings proposed by the county party committee are: planting cotton, oil crops, hemp, vegetables, medicinal materials, timber trees, dried fruit trees, fodder radishes, sugar radishes, reeds, weeping willows, and vinegar willows; the eight rearings are: raising large livestock, pigs, sheep, chickens, bees, silkworms, fish, and rabbits. A comprehensive development plan for the rural economy was also formulated, and the tasks were specifically assigned to the townships and communes. Reasonable planning and arrangements were made for land, labor, and funds, ensuring the development of diversified economy. The county has witnessed "Six Mores" and "Three Satisfactions." The six mores are: more fertilizer, more materials to support the state, more income for the people's communes, more grain production, more income for the commune members, and more people participating in labor; the three satisfactions are: the state, the commune, and the commune members are satisfied.

    “十二种”“八养”带来“六多”“三满意”
    本报讯  大跃进的一年来，中共山西武乡县委本着统筹兼顾，合理安排，保证中心，全面发展的领导方法，在以工农业生产为中心的前提下，领导群众开展“十二种”、“八养”运动，大力发展多种经济，获得了农、林、牧、副、渔空前大丰收。
    今年武乡多种经济大丰收。全县粮食产量比去年增长了两点八倍；油料、棉花、麻皮、蔬菜比去年增产一至七倍；植树八千七百七十七万株，比去年增长了三百七十七倍；至10月底止，全县生猪发展到七万余头，比去年增长了两点二倍多，全县每户平均养到两头猪；大牲畜比去年增长了13％；羊发展到十五万只，比去年增长了51％；鸡发展到二十八万只，全县平均每人养到两只；该县群众历史上从来没有养鱼、养兔的习惯，今年也发展了二千一百只兔、五万尾鱼；各种土特产品，野生植物的发展数量也都超过了历史上任何时期。
    武乡县在跃进以前，由于领导长时期存在着自给自足的经济观点，致使农村多种经济不能全面发展，结果形成集体生产资金缺乏，不能很好的扩大再生产和社员缺少零花钱的情况。去冬进入大跃进后，经过调查研究和群众商量，在今年4月间，县委提出了统筹兼顾、合理安排，以工农业生产为中心，开展“十二种”和“八养”运动，就使得全县农林牧副渔获得了全面大丰收。县委提出的十二种是：种棉花、油料、麻皮、蔬菜、药材、木材树、干水果树、饲料萝卜、糖萝卜、苇子、务柳、醋柳；八养是：养大牲畜、猪、羊、鸡、蜂、蚕、鱼、兔。并订出全面发展农村经济规划，将任务具体分配到乡、社。并对土地、劳力、资金等方面进行了合理的规划安排，保证了多种经济的发展。全县出现了“六多”“三满意”。六多是：肥料多，支援国家物资多，人民公社收入多，粮食增产多，社员收入多，参加劳动的人多；三满意是：国家、公社、社员满意。
