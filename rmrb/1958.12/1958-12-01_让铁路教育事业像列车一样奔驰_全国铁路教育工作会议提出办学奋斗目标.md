Let the Railway Education Undertaking Gallop Like a Train
National Railway Education Work Conference Sets Struggle Goals for Running Schools

(Shanghai dispatch from our newspaper) The Ministry of Railways held a National Railway Education Work Conference in Shanghai from October 29th to November 10th. The conference deeply studied and discussed the educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," and summarized and exchanged the experiences of some schools in work-study programs and factories, stations, and sections in running schools. The conference determined that in the future, under the leadership of the Party, the national railway education work will move towards the direction of "three-in-one: railway enterprise, school, and scientific research unit," and strive to popularize higher education among young and middle-aged workers within seven to ten years.

Comrade Kang Sheng, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, who was in Shanghai, attended the meeting and made an important speech on education work. He explained the essence of the Central Committee's educational policy and the great significance of factories running schools, stating that "this is necessary for the realization of the cultural revolution and for the realization of the great goal of communism." Comrade Kang Sheng also gave instructions on how to study and implement the Central Committee's educational policy. He said that first, it is necessary to study earnestly, grasp the spirit and essence of the instructions, and use this as a tool to fight against bourgeois educational thought; it is necessary to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and conduct great airing of views, great debates, and engage in criticism and self-criticism; it is necessary to run schools in combination with the production characteristics of railway enterprises, so that every factory, every construction site, and every station will gradually become a part-work, part-study school, and even utilize the favorable conditions of railway enterprises to run train universities.

Since April this year, national railway education has developed rapidly. At present, illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers on the entire railway has been basically eliminated. A total of 2,180 schools of various types have been established across the country, with more than 660,000 students. Among them, the number of railway universities has increased from the original two in Tangshan and Beijing to thirty-three. Large, medium, and primary schools in various regions have launched activities to participate in labor and work-study programs. All factories and stations have established schools, and 97 schools in Jilin, Beijing, Nanjing, and other places have piloted part-work, part-study programs. Some regions have also created new types of schools to adapt to the decentralized and mobile characteristics of railways. The First Comprehensive Detachment of the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways conducts surveying and mapping work in the deep mountains and valleys of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and border areas all year round. The entire detachment of 45 people has varying levels of education, from university students to those who have just shed the hat of illiteracy. They use the characteristics of mobility to erect tents in the mountain valleys and establish a practical university, conducting on-site teaching in combination with actual practice, aiming to gradually train all personnel in the detachment to become "all-rounders" who can master a variety of technical knowledge.

Representatives from more than 70 units, including railway bureaus, design institutes, factories, and directly affiliated colleges and universities from all over the country, after earnestly studying the educational policy and exchanging advanced experiences from various regions, generally felt that they had gained a lot. When some representatives first came to the meeting, they presented the conference with a list of demands for personnel, money, and equipment. Some representatives wanted to learn from the universities in Beijing, Tangshan, and other places at the conference and copy their set of teaching plans and syllabi to run a so-called "decent" school. Some believed that running schools, or even holding educational work conferences, during the current period of vigorous production and steelmaking was unrealistic and neglecting one's proper duties. Later, after listening to reports, through debates and big-character posters, they gradually understood the significance and purpose of running schools by the whole Party and the whole people, and at the same time criticized the so-called reduction of teaching quality in work-study programs and bourgeois "regularization" thinking, and their thinking greatly changed. The representatives who originally presented the "three demands" list all automatically withdrew it. Not only did they no longer ask for personnel, money, and equipment, but they also stated that they would mobilize all young and middle-aged workers and even their families to enroll in school. The Nanchang Railway Bureau is newly established and originally lacked experience. Now, it has initially proposed a draft plan for schools to open their doors to the public and students to go out of the campus. The representative of the Changchun Engineering Section originally thought that running a Red and Expert School was already good enough, but now they are determined to go back and establish an education system that includes "workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, high, large, medium, and small, young (i.e., research classes, universities, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens)."

    让铁路教育事业像列车一样奔驰
    全国铁路教育工作会议提出办学奋斗目标
    本报上海电  铁道部10月29日到11月10日在上海举行全国铁路教育工作会议，深入地学习和讨论了“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的教育方针，并且总结和交流了部分学校勤工俭学、工厂、站段办学的经验。会议确定今后全国铁路的教育工作，在党的领导下，朝着“铁路企业、学校、科学研究单位三合一”的方向进行，争取在七年到十年内，在青壮年职工中普及高等教育。
    正在上海的中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志到会作了关于教育工作的重要讲话。他说明了中央教育工作方针的精神实质，说明了工厂办学校的重大意义，“这是实现文化革命必需的，是实现共产主义的远大目标所必需的”。康生同志对如何学习贯彻中央关于教育方针，也作了指示。他说，首先要认真学习，掌握指示的精神和实质，以此为工具，同资产阶级教育思想斗争；要发动群众、依靠群众、大鸣大放大辩论，进行批评与自我批评，要结合铁路企业的生产特点大办学校，使每个工厂、每个工地、每个车站，逐渐变成半工半读的学校，甚至利用铁路企业的有利条件，可以举办列车大学。
    从今年4月以来，全国铁路教育有飞跃发展。到目前，全路青壮年职工文盲已基本扫除。各地一共办有各种学校二千一百八十所，在校学生六十六万多人。其中铁路大学，从原有唐山、北京两所已增加到三十三所。各地大、中、小学都开展了参加劳动、勤工俭学的活动。所有的工厂站段都办了学校，在吉林、北京、南京等地有九十七所学校已试行半工半读。有些地区还适应铁路分散流动的特点，创办了新型的学校。铁道部第一设计院第一综合分队，常年在青藏高原、边疆地区的深山大谷中进行勘察、测量工作。全队四十五人，文化程度从大学生到刚脱下文盲帽子的都有。他们就以流动的特点，在山沟里架起帐篷，创办实践大学，结合实际进行现场教学，要把全队人员逐步培养成为能掌握多种技术知识的“多面手”。
    来自全国各铁路局、设计院、工厂、直属院校等七十余个单位的代表们经过认真学习教育方针，交流各地的先进经验以后，普遍认为收获很大。有些代表在刚来参加会议时，向大会开出了一批要人、要钱、要设备的账单。有的代表想在会议上从北京、唐山等地的大学取经，把它们的一套教学计划、教学大纲搬回去，办一所所谓“像个样子”的学校。有的认为目前正在大搞生产，大炼钢铁的时候办学校，甚至开教育工作会议是不识时务，不务正业。后来听了报告，通过辩论，大字报，逐步理解了全党全民办学的意义和目的性，同时批判了所谓勤工俭学降低教学质量和资产阶级“正规化”思想，思想大有转变。原来提出“三要”账单的代表们都自动收回，他们不仅不再要人、要钱、要设备，并且表示要动员青壮年职工以至家属全部入学。南昌路局是新成立的，原来苦无经验，现在已初步提出了一个学校开门办学、学生走出校门的办学草案。长春工务段的代表原来认为办了红专学校已经不差了，现在决心回去要建立一个包括“工农兵学商、高大中小幼（即研究班、大学、中学、小学、幼儿园”的教育体系。
