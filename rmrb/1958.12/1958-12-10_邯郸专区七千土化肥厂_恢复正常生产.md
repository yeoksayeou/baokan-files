Handan Prefecture's 7,000 Indigenous Fertilizer Plants
Resume Normal Production

    (Our dispatch) Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, adopted the policy of "small indigenous groups," mobilizing the masses to utilize local materials and rely on their own efforts to produce indigenous fertilizer, actively addressing the fertilizer shortage problem that arose after basic agricultural water conservancy projects and deep plowing and close planting were implemented.

    During the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the demand for highly effective fine fertilizer by farmers in various counties of Handan Prefecture increased dramatically. This spring, when each county formulated its annual agricultural production plan, the demand for chemical fertilizers such as superphosphate for autumn crop topdressing alone amounted to more than 12.3 billion jin. This far exceeded the amount allocated to the prefecture by the state. To address this, the Prefectural Party Committee proposed mobilizing the masses to utilize local materials and manufacture indigenous chemical fertilizers themselves to solve the shortage of fine fertilizer. Simultaneously, a field meeting attended by more than 230 people, including rural work ministers from each county and city Party committee, was held in Quzhou County to promote the experience of the Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative in manufacturing chemical fertilizer using indigenous methods. A mass movement to manufacture indigenous fertilizer quickly unfolded throughout the prefecture. From July to September, over a period of three months, counties established 218,000 small indigenous fertilizer plants, producing more than 79 billion jin of indigenous fertilizer. This not only solved the problem of fertilizer shortage for autumn crop topdressing, but also enabled the more than 9 million mu of wheat sown this year to receive an average of 6,700 jin of indigenous fertilizer per mu as base fertilizer.

    In order to further develop the mass indigenous fertilizer industry and ensure high yields next year, counties began rectifying small indigenous fertilizer plants from late November, organizing normal production. As of December 5, more than 7,300 indigenous fertilizer plants throughout the prefecture had been rectified and resumed normal production, producing more than 1 billion jin of indigenous fertilizer.

    邯郸专区七千土化肥厂
    恢复正常生产
    本报讯  河北省邯郸专区采取小土群方针，发动群众就地取材，自力更生制造土化肥，积极解决农田基本水利化和深耕、密植以后的肥料缺乏问题。
    在农业大跃进中，邯郸专区各县农民对肥效高的细肥需求量日益剧增。今年春，各县制订全年农业生产计划时，只大秋作物追肥一项就要求专区供给过磷酸钙等化学肥料一百二十三亿多斤。远远超出了国家供给这个专区的数字。为此，地委提出了发动群众，就地取材，自己制造土化学肥料，解决细肥缺乏困难。同时，又在曲周县召开了有各县、市委农村工作部长等二百三十多人参加的现场会议，推广旭光农业社土法制造化学肥料经验。全区群众性的制造土化肥运动很快的开展起来了。从7月开始，到9月三个月时间，各县办起了二十一万八千座小型土化肥厂，生产了七百九十多亿斤土化肥，不仅解决了大秋作物追肥困难，还使今年播种的九百多万亩小麦，平均每亩施上了六千七百斤土化肥的底肥。
    为了进一步发展群众性的土化肥工业，保证明年高额丰产。从11月下旬，各县开始对小型土化肥厂进行整顿，组织正常生产。截至12月5日，全专区已有七千三百多座土化肥厂经过整顿恢复了正常生产，已生产土化肥十亿多斤。
