Joyful Production Intervals
	Tong Jie

In Hong'an County, Hubei Province, I saw labor, rest, and entertainment organically linked. Leaders at all levels participated in production, led production, participated in entertainment, and led entertainment. Everywhere you could see the lively scenes of leading cadres and the masses working and enjoying themselves together.

One morning, the members of the Xinghua Brigade of the Jiansu People's Commune were working intensely, and you could hear bursts of "Ah-ho!" sounds from afar. Suddenly, a young man shouted loudly, "Hey, Secretary Cheng is here to help us dig the ground!" Immediately, a round of applause erupted. As soon as Cheng Peng, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, arrived, people's enthusiasm increased even more! "Ah-ho... Ah-ho... Ah-ho..." The shouts rose and fell, and the ground was turned over piece by piece under the people's hoes.

After a while, it was time to rest. Comrade Cheng Peng picked up the loudspeaker and shouted, "Comrades, we've been working for half the morning, it's time to take a break!" People responded with cheers and laughter, gathering around him and naturally starting to chat. After a while, Comrade Cheng Peng suggested, "Let's sing a song and dance?" "Good, you start?" many people shouted together. Cheng Peng asked everyone to be quiet and then said, "I'll sing 'Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland,' and then it's your turn!" After speaking, he began to sing loudly. He also clapped along with the song, making people laugh joyfully. Father Wang Er laughed so hard that he couldn't close his mouth. Sister-in-law Li said her stomach hurt from laughing. More than twenty young girls rushed forward and started dancing the embroidery dance. They sang as they danced: "... Second embroidery Grandma Xu, a 53-year-old woman, takes the lead in fighting and production, and everyone praises her revolutionary spirit; Third embroidery Fang Heming, a Red Army regimental commander who became a farmer, truly a revolutionary hero, his fame spreads across the five lakes and four seas;..." A young man suddenly stood up and shouted slogans: "Learn from Grandma Xu! Learn from Regiment Commander Fang!" People followed suit. Before the slogans died down and people's right hands were lowered, eight old women, including Wang Chang'e, stood up and sang, "Produce more steel, produce more grain, support the People's Liberation Army, drive away the American wolves!..." "Good! Good!" Everyone applauded and cheered. Then, all the cadres and commune members danced the collective dance "Digging Peanuts."

The intense labor began again. Twenty mu of land was deep-plowed that day, and efficiency increased by 1.5 times. Commune member Qin Huixi said, "There's talking and singing, working and playing, playing happily and working happily!"

    欢乐的生产间隙  
    童杰
    在湖北红安县我看到劳动、休息、娱乐有机地联系了起来。各级领导都参加生产、领导生产；参加娱乐领导娱乐。到处可以看到领导干部和群众同生产、同娱乐的生动活泼情景。
    一个上午，建苏人民公社杏花大队的社员正在紧张地劳动，远远地就能听到阵阵的“啊荷！”声。突然，一个青年高声喊道：“喂，程书记来帮我们挖地了。”顿时响起了一片掌声。县委第一书记程鹏一来，人们的干劲更大啦！“啊荷……啊荷……啊荷……”喊声此起彼落，地在人们的锄头下一片又一片地翻着身。
    过了一阵子，到了该休息的时候了。程鹏同志拿起广播筒喊道：“同志们，我们劳动半上午了，该休息一会啦！”人们应声欢笑着聚拢过来，把他围在中央，自然地和他交谈起来。过了一会儿，程鹏同志提议说：“大家来唱个歌，跳个舞吧？”“好，那你先来一个？”好多人一齐喊起来。程鹏要大家安静些，然后说道：“我唱个‘兄妹开荒’，唱完了可该你们哪！”说完他就高声地唱起来了。他一面唱一面还打着拍子，逗得人们欢乐地大笑起来。王二爹笑得合不拢嘴。李大嫂说肚子都笑痛了。二十多个年轻姑娘一拥上前，跳起了绣花舞。她们边跳边唱：“……二绣徐大妈，五十三岁老人家，战斗、生产带头干，革命呀干劲人人夸；三绣方和明，红军团长当农民，真是革命英雄汉，五湖呀四海传美名；……”一个青年蓦地站起来呼口号：“向徐大妈学习！向方团长学习！”人们都跟着喊起来。口号声还未落，人们的右手还未放下来，王嫦娥等八个老太婆站出来唱道：“多出钢，多打粮，支援解放军，赶走美国狼！……”“好！好呀！”大家一齐鼓掌欢呼。接着，全体干部和社员们一起跳了集体舞“挖花生”。
    紧张的劳动又开始了。这天深翻了二十亩地，效率提高了一点五倍。社员秦辉喜说：“有说又有唱，有做又有玩，玩得痛快，做的痛快！”
