Also present to greet the delegation were the Mongolian Ambassador to China and member of the Mongolian government delegation, Lubsan, as well as diplomatic staff from the Mongolian Embassy in China. Tseren, Vice Chairman of the Mongolian State Planning Commission and member of the Mongolian government delegation, who had arrived in Beijing earlier, was also at the airport this afternoon to greet the delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd. Vice Premier He Long met with D. Molomzhamts, head of the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delegation members: Mongolian Ambassador to China Lubsan, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission Tseren, and accompanying personnel of the delegation this evening.

The hosts and guests had a cordial conversation during the meeting. Li Qiang, Liu Mingfu, Ji Pengfei and others were present at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd. Vice Premier He Long held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic headed by Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, D. Molomzhamts.

Vice Premier He Long and Deputy Chairman D. Molomzhamts spoke successively at the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere, congratulating the people of China and Mongolia on their increasing prosperity in the cause of socialist construction, and congratulating the traditional friendship between the fraternal people of China and Mongolia on becoming more consolidated and developed.

In his welcoming speech, Vice Premier He Long said: "The Mongolian people have given our people much help and support. In 1945, the Mongolian people, together with the Soviet people, helped our people defeat Japanese imperialism and powerfully supported the great revolutionary victory of the Chinese people." Vice Premier He Long continued: "In the struggle to build socialism, our two peoples support each other and cooperate closely. Since 1951, the Mongolian people have supported China's agricultural construction every year through trade in horses. This year, when our country's production was leaping forward and the demand for livestock power in rural areas was tight, the Mongolian people gratuitously presented our country with 15,000 draught horses."

Vice Premier He Long, speaking of the Chinese people's help to the Mongolian people, said: "Our people are very concerned about the socialist construction of the fraternal Mongolian people. In the future, within our capabilities, we are willing to help the fraternal Mongolian people develop animal husbandry, agriculture and industry even more."

Deputy Chairman D. Molomzhamts said in his speech: "Under the leadership of its own Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the People's Government, the Mongolian people are continuously achieving great victories in the sacred struggle to make their country a modern agricultural, animal husbandry and industrial country. The victory of the Mongolian people is inseparable from the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other socialist brother countries."

Deputy Chairman D. Molomzhamts said: "The great achievements made by the Chinese people in building socialism have aroused the well-deserved pride and joy of the Mongolian people and progressive mankind all over the world." He also said: "The fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese people are developing more and more for the happiness of our two peoples."

Li Qiang, Liu Mingfu, Ji Pengfei, Chen Weiji, Wang Xinyuan, Pan Qi, Jiang Qixian and others attended the banquet. Staff members of the Mongolian Embassy in China were invited to attend the banquet.
