    Advertisements and Headline News
    Xing Lijun

    Everyone reads the headline news in the newspaper; but the advertisements in the newspaper seem like something you can read or not read. When work gets busy, some people probably rarely read them, or don't even glance at them at all. If that's really the case, it's truly a pity!

    Now, it's not uncommon for advertisements to introduce new products that are on par with world standards. What's new is that advertisements and headline news now have a kind of "subtle" connection. For example, some time ago, many newspapers published the news of China's production of reactive dyes in a "headline position." Not long after, advertisements appeared introducing that the relevant factory had begun accepting orders for reactive dyes.

    On November 29th, the People's Daily had a particularly eye-catching advertisement: Introduction to some products of Beijing Agricultural University... following which were listed more than twenty product names. After seeing this advertisement, people couldn't help but think: The education policy of combining education with productive labor is really good, schools can actually produce products and serve industrial and agricultural production. Isn't that right? Just a few days ago, work-study programs and the combination of education with productive labor were still "headline news" in the newspaper. A few days later, the "product introduction" appearing in the newspaper's advertisement column became a follow-up report to this "headline news." This advertisement also said that they had already started accepting orders for 1959.

    I remember when the country first advocated for work-study programs, some people thought it was just a "temporary measure," a "movement only," and there was also slanderous talk, saying that schools running factories was just to "make up the numbers" in the national plan that had to be completed. Facts are the best answer; school factories are accepting orders for 1959! It is certain that more such advertisements will appear next year, the year after next...

    From this perspective, aren't these "product introduction" advertisements also the development and result of so many "headline news" in the newspapers!

    广告和头条新闻
    邢力军
    报纸上的头条新闻，是人人都看的；可是报纸上的广告，就好像是可看可不看的了，工作再一忙，大概有人很少去看了，或竟是一看也不看。要真是这样，那真是可惜！
    现在广告中介绍新产品的，赶上世界水平的，已经不稀奇了，新鲜的是广告跟头条新闻，如今也有了一种“微妙的”连系。例如，前些时候许多报纸都曾把我国制成活性染料的消息在“头条地位”刊出，隔了不久，广告上便介绍有关厂就开始承接活性染料订货了。
    11月29日人民日报上，有一个广告特别引人注目；北京农业大学部分产品介绍……以下列着二十种以上的产品名目。看了这幅广告，人们不禁想到：教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针真好，学校居然也能生产产品，为工农业生产服务了。不是吗，就在前几天，勤工俭学、教育与生产劳动相结合，还是报纸的“头条新闻”，几天以后，报纸广告栏出现的“产品介绍”就成了这“头条新闻”的连续报道。这条广告中还说已经开始预约1959年的订货了。
    记得国家初倡勤工俭学时，还有人以为不过是个“临时措施”、“运动而已”，也有一种诬蔑性的言论，说什么学校办工厂不过是为了在必须完成的国家计划中“凑凑数”而已。事实是最好的回答；学校工厂承接1959年的订货！可以肯定，明年、后年……将有更多这样的广告出现。
    从这个角度上看，这些“产品介绍”的广告不也正是许许多多报纸上“头条新闻”的发展和结果吗！
