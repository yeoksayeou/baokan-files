    Red Star on the Alföld Plain
    By our correspondent Wang Chongjie
    The vast Hungarian Alföld Plain spreads across both sides of the Tisza River. On this plain, the "Red Star Cooperative" of the nationally famous village of Dürge维 is one of the first agricultural production cooperatives established in Hungary ten years ago. Over the past decade, the "Red Star Cooperative" has continuously developed and consolidated. People have been successfully creating a new life with collective strength. Like a red star, it shines on the Hungarian fields, attracting people's attention.
          Night of Merriment
    On a rare clear winter day, we drove from Budapest to visit the "Red Star Cooperative." As we arrived in Dürge维 village, the streets leading to the local council were lined with men, women, old and young, all singing local folk songs to the accompaniment of a band.
    Birds are flying, birds are flying, birds are flying,
    The girls of Dürge维 have found their beloved ones,
    Their mouths are full of sweet kisses,
    The peanuts in their embroidered handkerchiefs are rustling.
    Soon, ten horse-drawn carriages carrying nine pairs of loving young men and women and their families slowly arrived. From their clothing and attire, we easily recognized the bridegrooms and brides. These nine young couples are all members of the "Red Star Cooperative," and all are skilled in labor.
    This year marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the "Red Star Cooperative." Recently, the cooperative also carried out its year-end accounting. These young people chose this day (December 6th) for a collective wedding in order to better integrate their personal happiness with the joy of all the cooperative members.
    Comrade Münnich, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, was also invited to attend the marriage registration ceremony and the wedding ceremony and evening party of these happy young people.
    In the evening, when the setting sun was still hanging on the horizon, the cooks had already prepared a sumptuous dinner. To the tune of melodious Hungarian folk music, more than two thousand people frequently raised their glasses to congratulate the brides and grooms, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the cooperative's establishment, and to celebrate the victorious achievements of the "Red Star Cooperative" members in production this year.
    Comrade Münnich encouraged the newlyweds and the members of the "Red Star Cooperative" to further improve production and make the production cooperative even better.
    Late into the night, people were still immersed in unrestrained singing and dancing. Men, women, old and young, danced the fast-paced Hungarian national dance, Czardas, together as if they would never tire. This is the revelry of people whose hearts are filled with true joy!
      Happiness is Created by Labor
    When Dürge维 activists began organizing a production cooperative in 1948, there were only ten members. In the spring of 1949, the number of households joining the "Red Star Cooperative" increased to sixty-three, with a total of 363 holds (each hold equals 8.55 mu). At that time, there were no livestock or farming implements at all, but these first members had amazing perseverance, a fervent desire to build a new life, and unwavering confidence. The newly established state tractor station provided great assistance to the "Red Star Cooperative" in terms of construction.
    That autumn, these pioneers of agricultural socialist transformation achieved their first great victory. The average grain yield of the cooperative was more than double that of individual farmers. At the end of the year, each work day earned more than twenty forints. After the autumn harvest, the "Red Star Cooperative" built spacious cattle sheds with electric lights and automatic drainage, and bought a batch of cattle, sheep, and horses.
    The facts educated the farmers of Dürge维, and the number of farmers requesting to join the cooperative increased day by day. By 1950, the "Red Star Cooperative" had increased to more than 160 households, with a total of 1,600 holds of land, and the cooperative's animal husbandry also developed rapidly.
    Because of the organization and cooperation, farmers have been able to fully adopt advanced agricultural production technology, and have been able to organize forces well to transform and conquer nature. In the past, drought was a frequent disaster for farmers here. Sometimes there was no water for the entire summer, the cultivated land cracked, and it was scorching hot. Scattered farmers were helpless in the face of the power of nature. They watched with tears as their beloved crops, orchards, and cattle and sheep died, and they also struggled in hunger. In 1935, the famous Hungarian writer Móricz described the scene in this area: "In summer, it is so painful to walk through the withered fallen leaves! Only dead roots remain of the grass, and even dry stems are hard to find. Herds of cattle, sheep, and horses have passed through the fields one after another, and they can no longer find food. The mouths of the livestock lick the ground, and occasionally they can find a little salty grass root."
    The organized farmers of the "Red Star Cooperative" were no longer willing to submit to the dictates of fate. They launched an offensive against nature, opened canals, built reservoirs, established irrigation systems, overcame the drought, and transformed more than 1,000 holds of salinized wasteland and low-yielding land into productive rice paddies, with an average yield of 3,500 kilograms of rice per hold.
    In 1953, the "Red Star Cooperative" was awarded the "Labor Red Banner Medal" for its outstanding achievements in production and cooperation.
    By the end of 1954, the "Red Star Cooperative" had increased to 1,175 members, with a total of 9,230 holds of land. By this time, almost all the farmers in Dürge维 village had joined the production cooperative. In August of this year, the National Conference of Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Chairmen was held here. People from all over the country carefully studied the establishment and production experience of the "Red Star Cooperative," and visited their rice paddies, modern breeding farms, and clubs.
    The state-owned machine tractor station plays an important role in the development of the "Red Star Cooperative." Currently, all the cooperative's sowing work is done by machines, and more than 90% of the deep plowing and harvesting work is also done by machines. The cooperative has also bought four large trucks, two trailers, and a small passenger car.
    The members of the "Red Star Cooperative" are very fond of labor and hope to do their best for the collective cause. When we visited the chicken farm, we met the chicken-raising elder Miszlai János. He is already eighty-three years old this year. Everyone advised him to retire, but he and his wife still enthusiastically take care of more than 1,000 chickens.
    People in the cooperative also praised the nine young couples who got married collectively this time, especially the Kalekasz Imre couple. The bridegroom Kalekasz is a skilled sheep herder. He loves his work. In order to raise the sheep better, he always insists on working as usual on his scheduled days off. This year he has more than 650 work days. The bride Rozsa also often participates in field labor like the young men. This year she has nearly 450 work days. In addition to production, they also actively participate in social work. The man is a Communist Party member, and the woman is the secretary of the cooperative's Communist Youth League branch.
    Although the yield of grain was affected by the drought this year, thanks to the hard work of the cooperative members, good labor organization, and the development of animal husbandry and sideline industries, the remuneration for each work day this year increased by two more forints than last year. The agricultural products sold by the cooperative to the state also greatly exceeded the planned amount.
        The Cooperativized Agricultural City
    The face of Dürge维 has completely changed in the past ten years. Today, it is more like a small city that fully meets the concept of modernization than a rural village, so people call it a "cooperativized agricultural city."
    The streets of Dürge维 are very neat, and many new houses have been built not long ago. Every house has electric lights, every household uses tap water, and the furniture, beds, and decorations are as exquisite as ordinary families in the city. Newly built highways and small railways closely connect the village with other towns.
    Dr. Szilágyi, who has worked here for many years, told reporters that in the past Dürge维 only had one doctor. Now a well-equipped clinic has been established here. Seven doctors work in the clinic. All maternity women go to the village's obstetrics hospital to give birth, and there are also very good nurseries. The infant mortality rate has been reduced from 17% before liberation to 3%, and many infectious diseases have also been eradicated. The village's public health facilities are complete, and hot spring baths have also been built on the outskirts of the village.
    With the improvement of material life, people's cultural life has also become richer day by day. Since the implementation of the eight-year universal education system and literacy work after liberation, people have almost forgotten the term "illiterate." Nowadays, every family has a radio, and there are also televisions in clubs and cultural palaces. Libraries and cinemas have become an indispensable part of people's lives. The cooperative also has its own amateur cultural troupe, which often performs wonderful programs. In addition, it also frequently invites actors from urban theaters to come here for mobile performances.
  Resolutely Take the Socialist Road
    In Dürge维, we also visited Márton Ferenc, a sixty-five-year-old cooperative member who was among the first to join the "Red Star Cooperative." He lives with his old partner in a new house built six years ago. Márton has three sons and four daughters. Except for one daughter who works in a textile factory in Budapest, the rest are members of the "Red Star Cooperative," and they all have their own houses. The fate of this elderly initiator of the cooperative's establishment is intertwined with the development of the cooperative. Until now, he still goes to the fields to work with the young cooperative members as usual.
    In the conversation, Old Man Márton quickly took us back to Dürge维 in the past. Before liberation, most of the land in this village was occupied by several landlords and a small number of rich peasants, and the vast number of peasants were forced to work for them like beasts of burden. Márton Ferenc's father was a hired worker. He himself began herding pigs for the landlord barefoot and in tattered clothes from the age of ten. The brutal landlords tried everything possible to enslave the hired workers. They only had three hours of sleep every day and night, and the little money they earned was not enough to maintain the minimum life for their wives and children.
    "The days of hardship are forever over. Now my children are living a happy life. They have an average income of about 2,000 forints per month. My children are incomparably happier than our generation. Next year, the cooperative will begin to provide pensions for the old cooperative members." Márton continued: "We will also build collective dining halls and our own sanatoriums, build ten new houses, and buy a bus..."
    During the conversation, the old man also often asked about the situation of the Chinese People's Communes, and he sincerely congratulated our country's farmers on launching mythical high-yield "satellites" of wheat and rice.
    But the road that the "Red Star Cooperative" has traveled in the past decade has not been smooth. The counter-revolutionary riots in October 1956 caused great losses to the agricultural cooperative movement across the country. At that time, the overthrown landlords, rich peasants, and revisionists in the Dürge维 area united to organize the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" and the Smallholders Party. They also formulated a restoration plan and carried out sabotage activities. A small number of wavering peasants successively withdrew from the cooperative.
    However, the conspiracy of the counter-revolutionary elements did not succeed, and the vast number of peasants were not deceived. The members of the "Red Star Cooperative" personally experienced the benefits that the cooperative brought to them, and they did not forget their life before liberation. In those turbulent days, they defended their cooperative, organized pickets, and suppressed the counter-revolutionary elements' restoration activities.
    Two years have passed since then. Most of those who withdrew from the production cooperative at that time have rejoined the cooperative one after another. At the end of this year, another twenty-seven households joined the cooperative. Reality once again educated the people that only by advancing along the socialist road can they move towards a happy situation. Now the "Red Star Cooperative" has become more consolidated.
    Under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, Hungary has achieved great success in agricultural cooperation this year. At present, there are nearly 3,700 production cooperatives in Hungary, with a cultivated area of more than 1.22 million holds. Agricultural production cooperatives are constantly emerging, and the number of farmers joining cooperatives is increasing rapidly day by day.

    阿尔斐德原野上的红星
    本报记者  王崇杰
    宽阔的匈牙利阿尔斐德大平原分布在蒂萨河的东西两岸，在这平原上，闻名全国的杜尔盖维村的“红星社”是十年前在匈牙利最先建立起来的农业生产合作社之一。十年来，“红星社”不断地发展和巩固，人们用集体的力量胜利地创造着新生活，它好像一颗红星一样闪耀在匈牙利的原野上，吸引着人们的视线。
          狂欢之夜
    在一个冬天少见的晴朗日子里，我们乘了一辆汽车从布达佩斯到“红星社”去访问。当我们到了杜尔盖维村时，在通向地方议会的街道两旁站满了男女老少，大家在乐队的伴奏下唱着当地的民歌。
    鸟在飞翔，鸟在飞翔，鸟在飞翔，
    杜尔盖维的姑娘找到了心爱的对象，
    她的嘴里饱含着甜蜜的吻，
    她锦绣的手绢里的花生在沙沙作响。
    一会儿十辆马车载着九对相爱的青年男女和他们的家属缓缓地驶来，从服装和打扮上，我们很容易地就认出了新郎和新娘。这九对青年都是“红星社”的社员，也都是劳动的能手。
    今年是“红星社”建社十周年，日前，社里又进行了年终结账。这些青年所以选择了这一天（12月6日）集体结婚，是为了把个人的幸福更好地和全体社员们的欢乐紧密地溶合起来。
    匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫同志也应邀参加了这批幸福青年人的结婚登记仪式和夜里的结婚典礼与晚会。
    傍晚，当夕阳还悬在地平线上的时候，厨师们就已经准备好了丰满的晚餐，在悠扬的匈牙利民族音乐的旋律中，两千多人频频举杯祝贺新娘新郎们幸福，祝贺建社十周年，祝贺“红星社”社员们今年在生产上取得的胜利成果。
    明尼赫同志勉励新婚夫妇和“红星社”的社员们要进一步把生产搞好，把生产合作社办得更美好。
    夜深了，人们还沉醉在纵情的歌舞中，男女老少好像永远不会疲乏似地一起跳着节奏紧迫的匈牙利民族舞查尔达什。这是内心充满了真正的喜悦的人们的狂欢！
      幸福是劳动创造的
    当1948年杜尔盖维积极分子开始组织生产合作社时，只有十个社员。1949年春加入“红星社”的增加为六十三户，共有三百六十三霍尔特（每一霍尔特合八点五五市亩）的土地。当时根本没有牲畜和耕种器具，但是这第一批社员们有着惊人的毅力、建立新生活的热烈愿望和必胜的信心。在建社方面，国家新建立的拖拉机站给了“红星社”很大的帮助。
    当年秋天，这批农业社会主义改造的先锋者，就取得了第一次巨大的胜利。合作社的谷物平均产量比个体农民高出了一倍多，年终结账时，每个劳动日可得二十多福林（匈币）。秋后“红星社”就建筑了有电灯和自动排水器的宽大的牛房，并且买了一批牛、羊和马。
    事实教育了杜尔盖维的农民，要求入社的农民一天比一天多起来。1950年“红星社”的社员就增加到一百六十多户，共有一千六百霍尔特的土地，社里畜牧业也得到了迅速的发展。
    由于组织起来，实行了合作化，农民们就有可能充分地采用先进的农业生产技术，就有可能很好地组织力量改造和征服自然。以前，旱灾是这里农民们的经常的灾难，有时整个的夏天都苦无滴水，耕地龟裂，热得发烫。分散的农民，在自然的威力下束手无策，他们含着眼泪看着心爱的庄稼、果园和牛羊死去，自己也在饥饿中残喘着。1935年著名的匈牙利作家莫里兹对这一带的情景曾作过这样的描述：“在夏天，踏着枯萎的落叶走过，是多么令人酸痛啊！草只剩下了死去的根，连干枯的茎也很难找到。牛群、羊群和马群先后地从原野上走过，它们再也找不到食物，牲畜的嘴舐着土地，偶而才能寻到一点咸草根。”
    组织起来的“红星社”的农民再也不愿听从命运的摆布，他们向自然展开了进攻，开河渠，修水库，建立了灌溉系统，战胜了旱灾，并且把一千多霍尔特盐化了的荒地和少产地变成了多产的稻田，每霍尔特平均可获得三千五百公斤大米。
    1953年“红星社”由于在生产和合作化方面获得了优越的成绩，光荣地得到了“劳动红旗勋章”。
    1954年底“红星社”的社员已经增加到一千一百七十五人，共有九千二百三十霍尔特土地，这时杜尔盖维村的农民差不多都加入了生产合作社。今年8月在这里召开了全国先进农业生产合作社社长会议，来自各地的人们仔细的研究了“红星社”的建社和生产经验，参观了他们的稻田、现代化的饲养场和俱乐部等。
    国营机器拖拉机站对“红星社”的发展有着很重要的意义，目前社里全部的播种工作都使用机器，深耕和收割工作90％以上的也是使用机器，合作社自己还买了四辆大卡车、两辆拖运车和一辆小客车。
    “红星社”的社员们非常热爱劳动，都希望更多地为集体的事业尽自己最大的努力。我们在参观养鸡场时，遇到了养鸡老人米斯拉伊·亚诺什，他今年已经八十三岁了，大家都劝他退休，可是他还是跟自己的妻子热心地照管着一千多只鸡。
    社里的人也非常夸奖这次集体结婚的九对青年，尤其是卡雷卡什·依姆雷夫妇。新郎卡雷卡什是放羊的能手，他热爱自己的工作，为了把羊饲养的更好，在规定的休息日，他也总是照常坚持工作，今年他有六百五十多个劳动日，新娘罗若也经常和小伙子们一样地参加田间劳动，今年她有将近四百五十个劳动日。除了生产外，他们还积极参加社会工作，男的是共产党员，女的是社里的团支部书记。
    虽然由于今年天旱谷物的产量受到影响，但由于社员们的辛勤劳动，由于劳动组织得好、发展了牧畜业和副业，所以今年每个劳动日的报酬比去年增加了两个多福林。社里卖给国家的农产品也大大超过了预定数额。
        合作化的农业城
    十年来杜尔盖维的面貌完全改变了，今天与其说这是一个农村，不如说这是一个完全合乎现代化概念的小城，所以人们把它叫着“合作化的农业城”。
    杜尔盖维的街道是非常整齐的，很多新的住宅都是不久以前建立起来的，家家都有电灯，户户都用自来水，家具、床和装饰品都是像城市里的普通家庭一样地讲究。新建筑的公路和小铁道把村子和其他城镇紧紧地联系在一起。
    在这里工作了很多年的医生席拉基同志对记者说，过去杜尔盖维只有一个医生，现在这里设立了设备完善的诊疗所，在诊疗所工作的有七个医生，所有的产妇都到村里的产科医院生产，并且有很好的托儿所，婴儿的死亡率由解放前的17％降低到3％，很多传染病也都根除了。村里的公共卫生设备都很齐全，在村郊还修建了温泉浴池。
    随着物质生活的改善，人民的文化生活也一天一天的丰富起来。由于解放后实行了八年制的普及教育和进行了扫盲工作，现在人们差不多都把“文盲”这个名词忘记了。如今每家都有收音机，俱乐部和文化宫里还有电视机，图书馆和电影院已经成了人们生活中不可缺少的组成部分。社里并且有自己的业余文工团，常演出精彩的节目，另外还经常邀请城市剧院的演员到这里来作流动演出。
  坚决地走社会主义的路
    在杜尔盖维，我们还访问了第一批参加“红星社”的六十五岁的老社员马尔丁·费伦茨，他同自己的老伴住在六年前建筑的一所新房子里。马尔丁老人，有三个儿子和四个女儿，除一个女儿在布达佩斯纺织厂工作外，其余的都是“红星社”的社员，他们都有自己的住宅。这位发起建社的老人的命运是和合作社的发展交织在一起的，直到现在他还是照常地同青年社员们一起到田间去工作。
    马尔丁老伯在谈话中，很快地就把我们带回到往年的杜尔盖维。解放前，这个村子的大部分土地是为几家地主和少数富农霸占着，广大的农民被迫牛马似地为他们劳动。马尔丁·费伦茨的父亲是雇工，他自己从十岁起也就赤着脚穿着破烂的衣服给地主放猪。残暴的地主想尽一切办法来奴役雇工，他们每昼夜只有三小时的睡觉时间，而赚得的一点钱不足维持老婆孩子最低的生活。
    “苦难的日子永远成为过去了，现在我的儿女们都过着美满的生活，他们每月平均都有两千左右福林的收入。我的孩子们比我们这一代就更幸福得无法比较啦。明年社里将开始供给老社员养老金。”马尔丁接着说道：“还要建立集体饭厅和自己的休养所，将盖十所新房子，买一辆公共汽车……”
    在谈话时，这位老人也常问起中国人民公社的情况，他并且衷心祝贺我国农民发射的神话似的小麦和大米高产“卫星”。
    但是十年来“红星社”走过的路并不是很平坦的，1956年10月的反革命暴乱使全国的农业合作社运动受到很大的损失，那时杜尔盖维一带被推翻的地主、富农和修正主义分子联合起来组织了所谓“革命委员会”和小农党，他们并且制定了复辟计划，进行了破坏活动，一小部分不坚定的农民相继地退出了合作社。
    然而反革命分子的阴谋并没有得逞，广大的农民并没有受骗。“红星社”的社员们亲自体验到合作社给他们带来的好处，他们也没有忘记解放前自己的生活情景。在那些动乱的日子里，他们捍卫了自己的社，组织了纠察队，镇压了反革命分子的复辟活动。
    从那时候起，两年已经过去了，那些当时退出生产合作社的人大部分都先后重新加入了社，今年年终结账时，又有二十七户加入了社。现实再一次地教育了人们，只有沿着社会主义的大路前进，才能走向幸福的境地。现在“红星社”变得更加巩固了。
    在社会主义工人党的领导下，今年匈牙利在农业合作化方面取得了很大成就，目前，匈牙利全国已有将近三千七百个生产合作社，耕地面积已达一百二十二万多霍尔特，农业生产合作社在不断出现，加入合作社的农民也一天比一天地迅速增加。
