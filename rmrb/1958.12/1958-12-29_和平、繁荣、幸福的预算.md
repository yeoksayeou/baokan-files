    Budget for Peace, Prosperity, and Happiness
    Cheng Guangrui
    At the end of the year, good news keeps coming from the construction front of the socialist camp, making the working people feel doubly happy. Recently, the second session of the Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted the 1959 Soviet National Budget Law, which added a few more scenes of peace, prosperity, and happiness to this camp.
    1959 is the first year for the Soviet Union to realize its Seven-Year Plan. The main task of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is: "On the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, to further vigorously develop all economic sectors, vigorously strengthen the country's economic potential, so as to ensure the continuous improvement of people's living standards." The 1959 Soviet national budget allocates a large amount of funds to vigorously develop the national economy, strengthen the economic and cultural construction of the republics, expand social and cultural facilities, and housing construction. This fully embodies the spirit of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan.
    The total amount of the 1959 Soviet national budget has greatly increased. The total revenue of this budget is 723,369,159,000 rubles, and the total expenditure is 707,637,887,000 rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by nearly 16 billion rubles. Compared with the estimated completed amount in 1958, the budget revenue will increase by more than 9%, and the expenditure will increase by about 10%. The increase in Soviet fiscal revenue shows that the socialist accumulation of the Soviet Union is growing, and its financial strength is becoming more robust. This enables the Soviet Union to spend more funds to further develop the national economy and improve people's living standards.
    In 1959, the Soviet national economy will have a huge development: the total industrial output value will increase by 7.7% compared with 1958, and the agricultural output value will also increase significantly. Therefore, the 1959 Soviet national budget allocated more than 308.9 billion rubles to the development of the national economy, an increase of more than 50 billion rubles compared with 1958. This is a significant increase. In order to accelerate the development of the Soviet economy as much as possible, so as to win time in the peaceful economic competition with the most developed capitalist countries, the Soviet Seven-Year Plan emphasizes the need to first develop the heavy industrial sectors that can promote the further rapid upsurge of the entire national economy, and to change the structure of many economic sectors, first of all, to change the structure of fuel production. The plan stipulates that in the next seven years, the Soviet Union will greatly increase the production of steel and non-ferrous metals, accelerate the development of the chemical industry, and give priority to the development of the most economical fuels—oil and gas; and pay great attention to the development of the machinery manufacturing industry to promote technological progress in all sectors of the national economy. In line with the Seven-Year Plan, the 1959 Soviet national budget has the largest increase in allocations for the ferrous metallurgy industry, the chemical industry, the fuel industry, and the machinery manufacturing industry. In 1959, the allocation for the development of the ferrous metallurgy industry increased by 32% compared with 1958, the chemical industry increased by 71%, the oil and gas industry increased by 23%, and the machinery manufacturing industry increased by 33%. This will ensure the rapid growth of production in the main industrial sectors of the Soviet Union.
    In recent years, the Soviet Communist Party and the government have taken many important measures to enhance the role of the republics in the economic and cultural construction of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Seven-Year Plan also stipulates that production forces should be rationally distributed throughout the country to ensure the upsurge of the economies of the republics. The 1959 Soviet national budget also fully reflects this. The total amount of the national budgets of the republics in 1959 is 343.5 billion rubles, which is about 20 billion rubles more than the expected completion in 1958. Taking Belarus as an example, the budget of this republic has increased from about 4 billion rubles in 1953 to more than 10 billion rubles in 1958; in the next seven years, the investment in basic construction of the national economy of this republic will be almost equal to the total investment of the past forty years. What an amazing growth! The Soviet Union's measures in this regard will further promote the economic and cultural prosperity of the republics and further strengthen the friendship and unity of all fraternal nations of the Soviet Union.
    The investment in the 1959 Soviet national budget clearly shows the consistent and infinite care of the Soviet Communist Party and the government for the living welfare of the Soviet people. The budget stipulates that the allocation for social and cultural facilities is more than 232.1 billion rubles, an increase of more than 19 billion rubles compared with 1958; the allocation for housing construction is 41.4 billion rubles, an increase of about 5 billion rubles compared with 1958. In 1959, residential buildings with a total area of 80 million square meters will be started. In addition, in 1959, the income from the socialist economy in the Soviet national budget increased by 85 billion rubles compared with this year, accounting for 90.7% of the total budget income; while the income from residents decreased by 5.3 billion rubles. The proportion of tax revenue in the budget revenue will account for 7.8%, which is maintained at this year's level. This also shows that the people's expenditure is further reduced, and the living welfare is further increased.
    The Soviet government has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. In recent years, the Soviet Union has repeatedly reduced its armed forces and reduced its defense expenditures to facilitate the easing of international tensions. However, at present, imperialist aggression groups are still establishing military bases all over the world, continuing to pursue aggression and war policies, and attempting to continue to create international tensions. Under such circumstances, the Soviet government has to pay attention to its own defense forces. The 1959 Soviet national budget stipulates that the allocation for defense is more than 96 billion rubles, which is slightly reduced compared with this year's level (96.3 billion rubles in 1958). This fully reflects the peaceful nature of the Soviet national budget.
    However, what people see from the US national budget for the 1960 fiscal year (July 1, 1959 to June 30, 1960) is a different scene.
    In order to get out of the quagmire of the economic crisis, the US government once attempted to stimulate the economy by significantly increasing spending. The US government frantically increased spending, so that some enterprises, especially those related to military production, obtained a large number of orders, which temporarily stimulated the production of these enterprises. However, this artificial stimulus not only failed to allow US monopoly capital to get rid of the crisis of production "surplus," but on the contrary, a large amount of spending has caused a serious financial crisis. The deficit in the US government's 1959 fiscal year budget will reach 12.2 billion US dollars, and the total amount including cash spending outside the budget will reach more than 13 billion US dollars. This figure is more than 2.5 billion US dollars more than the highest budget deficit during the US invasion of Korea. In order to cope with this critical situation, the US ruling group has decided to launch a new offensive against the ordinary people of the United States in the new fiscal year.
    The expenditure of the US 1960 fiscal year budget is about 77 billion US dollars, and direct military expenditure alone accounts for 42 billion US dollars, which is equivalent to 54% of the budget expenditure. Even Eisenhower himself admitted that "defense costs will be more than in any previous period in peacetime." This will inevitably lead to a significant reduction in civilian spending. Eisenhower said in the budget statement that "one way to reduce overall spending is to end temporary programs in agriculture, unemployment insurance, and housing"; at the same time, postal rates and gasoline taxes will also be increased, and some new user fees for government public services will be stipulated to increase revenue. This shows that in the new fiscal year, the United States will rely on further plunder of the American people to fill the bottomless pit of military spending.
    The new Soviet national budget and the US government budget once again prove to the world who loves peace and which system is superior. As Argentina's "Times" pointed out: The Soviet national budget is a "peace budget." France's "Dawn News" had to admit: "The 1959 Soviet national budget shows that communism is economically superior to capitalism."
    The 1959 Soviet national budget, like in the past, is a budget for peace, prosperity, and happiness. This budget once again embodies the Soviet people's desire for peace. At the same time, in contrast to the severe financial crisis in the United States reflected in the US government budget, the Soviet national budget shows the Soviet Union's growing financial strength. It will ensure that the Soviet people take the first victorious step towards the great goal of communism in accordance with the path marked by the Seven-Year Plan.

    和平、繁荣、幸福的预算  
    程光锐
    岁尾年头，社会主义阵营建设战线上捷报频传，劳动人民倍觉欢欣。最近第五届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议通过了1959年苏联国家预算法，更给这个阵营增添了几番和平、繁荣和幸福的景象。
    1959年是苏联实现七年计划的头一年。苏联七年计划的主要任务是：“在优先发展重工业的基础上，进一步大力发展各个经济部门，大力加强国家的经济潜力，以保证人民生活水平的不断提高。”1959年的苏联国家预算，把大量资金用于大力发展国民经济、加强加盟共和国的经济和文化建设、扩大社会和文化设施以及住宅建筑等方面。这完全体现了苏联七年计划的精神。
    1959年苏联国家预算的总额大大增加了。这个预算的总收入为七千二百三十三亿六千九百一十五万九千卢布，总支出为七千零七十六亿三千七百八十八万七千卢布，收入差不多超过支出一百六十亿卢布。与1958年估计完成的数额相比，预算收入约将增加9％以上，支出约将增加10％以上。苏联财政收入的增加表明，苏联的社会主义积累日益增长，财政力量更加雄厚。这就使苏联能够支出更多的资金来进一步发展国民经济和提高人民生活水平。
    1959年苏联国民经济将有巨大的发展：工业总产值将比1958年增加7.7％，农业产值也将大大增加。因此，1959年苏联国家预算在发展国民经济方面的拨款达三千零八十九亿多卢布，比1958年增加了五百多亿卢布。这是很大的增加。为了竭力加速苏联经济的发展，以便在同最发达的资本主义国家和平经济竞赛中赢得时间，苏联七年计划强调要首先发展那些能够促进整个国民经济进一步迅速高涨的重工业部门，并且要改变许多经济部门的结构，首先是改变燃料生产的结构。这个计划规定，今后七年中，苏联将大量增加钢铁和有色金属的生产，加速发展化学工业和优先发展最经济的燃料——石油和煤气的生产；并且非常注意发展机器制造业，以促进国民经济各部门的技术进步。同七年计划相适应，1959年苏联国家预算在黑色金属工业、化学工业、燃料工业和机器制造业方面的拨款增加最多。1959年发展黑色金属工业的拨款比1958年增加32％，化学工业增加71％，石油和煤气工业增加23％，机器制造业增加33％。这将保证苏联主要工业部门的生产迅速增长。
    近年来，苏联共产党和政府采取了许多重要措施来提高各加盟共和国在苏联经济和文化建设中的作用。苏联七年计划也规定，在全国合理地分布生产力，以保证各加盟共和国经济的高涨。1959年苏联国家预算也充分地反映了这一点。1959年各加盟共和国的国家预算总额为三千四百三十五亿卢布，比1958年预计完成的大约要多二百亿卢布。以白俄罗斯为例，1958年这个共和国的预算已从1953年的四十亿卢布左右增加到一百多亿卢布；在今后七年中，这个共和国的国民经济基本建设投资将差不多等于过去四十年的全部投资。这是多么惊人的增长！苏联在这方面的措施，将进一步促进各加盟共和国经济和文化的繁荣，并且将进一步加强苏联各兄弟民族的友谊和团结。
    1959年苏联国家预算的投资，十分明显地表现出苏联共产党和政府一贯对苏联人民生活福利的无限关怀。预算中规定：社会和文化设施的拨款为二千三百二十一亿多卢布，比1958年增加一百九十多亿卢布；住宅建筑拨款为四百一十四亿卢布，比1958年约增加五十亿卢布。1959年将有总面积达八千万平方公尺的住宅开工建筑。此外，在1959年，苏联国家预算收入中，来自社会主义经济的收入比今年增加了八百五十亿卢布，占全部预算收入的90.7％；而来自居民的收入则减少了五十三亿卢布。预算收入中的税收比重将占7.8％，即保持在今年的水平上。这也表现出人民的支出更加减轻，生活福利进一步增长了。
    苏联政府一贯执行着和平外交政策。这几年来，苏联一再裁减武装部队和削减国防费用，以利于国际紧张局势的缓和。但是，目前帝国主义侵略集团仍在世界各地建立军事基地，继续推行侵略和战争政策，企图继续制造国际紧张局势。在这种情况下，苏联政府不得不注意自己的国防力量。1959年苏联国家预算中规定国防方面的拨款为九百六十亿多卢布，与今年的水平（1958年为九百六十三亿卢布）相较稍有削减。这充分反映了苏联国家预算的和平性质。
    然而，人们从美国1960财政年度（1959年7月1日到1960年6月30日）的国家预算中看到的，却是另一番景象。
    美国政府为了走出经济危机的泥淖，曾经企图用大量增加开支的办法刺激经济。美国政府疯狂地增加开支，使一些企业，特别是同军事生产有关的企业获得大批订货，暂时刺激了这些企业的生产。然而这种人为的刺激不但没有使美国垄断资本摆脱生产“过剩”的危机，相反地，大量的开支已引起严重的财政危机。美国政府1959财政年度预算的赤字将达到一百二十二亿美元，再加上预算以外的现金花费，总数将达到一百三十亿美元以上。这个数字比美国侵朝战争时期最高的预算赤字还要多二十五亿美元以上。为了应付这种危急的局面，美国统治集团已决定在新的财政年度中，向美国普通人民展开新的进攻。
    美国1960财政年度预算的开支约为七百七十亿美元，单单直接军费就占四百二十亿美元，即相当于预算开支的54％，连艾森豪威尔自己也承认，“国防费用将比和平时期中以往任何时期都要多”。这就不可避免地要大大削减民用方面的开支。艾森豪威尔在预算声明中说，“减少总的开支的一部分办法是结束在农业、失业保险和住房方面的暂时计划”；同时，还将增加邮资和汽油的税收，并规定政府公共事业的某些新的使用费以增加收入。这就说明，美国在新的财政年度中，将依靠对美国人民的进一步掠夺来填补军事开支的无底洞。
    新的苏联国家预算和美国政府预算，再一次向全世界证明谁是爱好和平的，并且再一次证明究竟哪种制度优越。正如阿根廷“时报”所指出的：苏联国家预算是“和平预算”。法国“震旦报”也不得不承认：“1959年苏联国家预算表明共产主义在经济方面比资本主义优越。”
    1959年的苏联国家预算和过去一样，是一个为了和平、繁荣和幸福的预算。这个预算又一次体现了苏联人民的和平愿望。同时，与美国政府预算中反映了美国严重的财政危机相反，苏联国家预算显示了苏联日益增长的雄厚的财政力量。它将保证苏联人民按照七年计划所标志的道路，向共产主义的伟大目标迈开胜利的第一步。
