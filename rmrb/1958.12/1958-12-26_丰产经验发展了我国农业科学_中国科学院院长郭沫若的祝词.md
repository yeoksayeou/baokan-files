Comrades, Friends:

Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and all scientific workers, to extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to this conference, to the representatives of the various advanced agricultural units that have created agricultural miracles, and to the representatives of the activists in eliminating the four pests who have made great contributions to the patriotic health campaign.

1958 is a year in which our country has achieved great victories in all aspects, a year of great leaps forward in all aspects of our industrial and agricultural production and scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings. The mass great leap forward movement, initiated first on the agricultural front, and the high tide of people's communes that emerged on this basis, have promoted great leaps forward in all aspects of industry, science, culture, and education with an irresistible force. This mass great leap forward movement has now borne abundant fruit throughout the country. In a short year, our steel production has doubled, and the output of grain and cotton has doubled, creating unprecedented miracles in human history. This is a great victory for the Party's general line for building socialism, and a great victory for the rectification movement against conservatism, breaking down superstitions, and liberating thought.

In the past, people always thought that the increase in agricultural output could not be achieved by leaps and bounds. Some people believed that agricultural output could not increase by more than 10% per year. However, the reality of the national agricultural bumper harvest in 1958 completely negated this argument. What is particularly encouraging is that a series of high-yield agricultural satellites have been launched on our agricultural front. These achievements have shaken the world. These achievements, like a fierce wind sweeping away fallen leaves, have thoroughly shattered the nonsense of the "law of diminishing returns" advocated by all bourgeois and their employed scholars.

In conjunction with the great leap forward in production, our country has also launched a large-scale patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, eliminating hundreds of millions of rats and sparrows, and tens of millions of catties of mosquitoes and flies. All of these are brilliant achievements made by the 650 million people under the leadership of the Party, with soaring enthusiasm. These achievements are rapidly changing our country's poor and blank state, and moving towards the goal of a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

The development of this year's agricultural bumper harvest and patriotic health campaign not only has great economic and political significance but also has a profound impact on scientific undertakings. First of all, it broke many old arguments and made valuable contributions to scientific work. The Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, centered on deep plowing, has proposed new directions for soil, plant physiology, agricultural cultivation, crop cultivation, and agricultural machinery disciplines. The characteristic of Chinese farmers using organic fertilizers for a long time has enabled the development of fertilizer science; the mass soil survey, identification, and soil improvement work in Guangdong Province and across the country, enriched and developed China's soil science with the rich soil knowledge and experience of Chinese farmers.

Among them, familiar examples include Ma Tongyi's deep plowing method, various crop varieties created by Jiang Shaofang and many other comrades using distant hybridization methods, Wang Baojing's field design science, Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton field management, Li Shimei's research on the life history and control methods of termites, Cao Yixiu's research on the living habits and control methods of field mice, etc., all of which should be important contributions to scientific research this year.

In the patriotic health campaign, we have taken large-scale mass actions for the first time in human history to attack the diseases and four pests that endanger humanity the most, and have achieved brilliant achievements. This has opened up a grand prospect for medical and health work. Numerous new creations and inventions are emerging. These contributions, like the scientific and technological creations on other fronts, have shattered people's mysterious views on science, showing people's wisdom and creativity. After the great ideological liberation of communism, it is incomparably rich and magnificent.

The fact of the agricultural bumper harvest also shows that the rich experience accumulated by Chinese farmers in agricultural production practice for thousands of years is an ocean of wisdom, an inexhaustible treasure trove of knowledge. Science originates from practice, and science can only understand the laws of nature through practice and use the laws of nature to promote the transformation of nature to achieve the goal of benefiting mankind. Therefore, scientific work must be connected with reality and must follow the mass line, which has been undeniably proven in the reality of agricultural bumper harvests. Many scientific workers have a deep understanding of this and expressed that they must put down their airs, appear as ordinary laborers, take the masses as teachers, humbly learn from the masses, and contribute all their strength to the development of China's scientific undertakings and production and construction undertakings.

Today, science is no longer the "patent" of a few people, and the great era in which science is truly mastered by the people has arrived. All provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country are vigorously developing science, and many counties and people's communes are engaged in scientific research. Some provinces have already built scientific research networks. Obviously, the great achievements of China's industry, agriculture, and patriotic health campaign this year are inseparable from the fact that the people have begun to master science. In the future, we must further strive to implement the policy of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, combining science and technology with production practice, and combining popularization with improvement, so that the mass technical revolution movement and professional scientific research work can be combined, develop vigorously on a larger scale and at a faster speed, and more powerfully support production construction and cultural construction.

1958 is about to pass, and the even greater leap forward 1959 is coming soon. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has issued a new and resounding call to achieve a greater victory next year. In industry, steel production will increase to 18 million tons, and coal production will increase to 380 million tons. In agriculture, grain output will increase to about 1,050 billion catties, and cotton output will increase to about 100 million dan. In order to achieve these tasks, we must follow the teachings of the Party: despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically, we must have both soaring enthusiasm and a scientific spirit of analysis, combine the spirit of seeking truth from facts with revolutionary enthusiasm, oppose exaggeration, oppose concealing shortcomings, and strive to victoriously and over-fulfill the tasks given to us by the Party and the state. Let me wish all the representatives greater achievements in agricultural production and the patriotic health campaign next year, and at the same time, make more contributions to scientific undertakings.

### 丰产经验发展了我国农业科学  中国科学院院长郭沫若的祝词

    丰产经验发展了我国农业科学
    中国科学院院长郭沫若的祝词同志们，朋友们：
    请允许我代表中国科学院和全国科学工作者向大会、向创造了农业奇迹的各个农业先进单位的代表们和在爱国卫生运动中作出了巨大贡献的除四害积极分子代表们表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    1958年是我们国家在各个方面都取得伟大胜利的一年，是我国工农业生产和科学文化教育事业各方面的大跃进的一年。由农业战线上首先发起的全民大跃进的运动，和在这个基础上出现的人民公社化高潮，以乘风破浪之势，促进了工业和科学文化教育事业各个方面的大跃进。这个全民大跃进运动现在已经在全国结出了丰硕的果实。短短的一年里，我们的钢铁翻了一番，粮食棉花的产量翻了一番，造出了人类历史上空前未有的奇迹。这是党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利，是反对保守、破除迷信，解放思想的整风运动的伟大胜利。
    过去人们对于农业产量的增加总认为是不能够跃进的。有些人认为农业产量不可能每年增加10％以上。然而1958年全国农业丰产的实际完全否定了这个论点。特别令人振奋的是在我们农业战线上放出了一系列的高额丰产卫星。这些成绩已经震动了全世界。这些成绩像疾风扫落叶似的，把一切资产阶级和其御用学者们所叫嚣的“土地报酬递减律”的胡说彻底地粉碎了。
    结合着生产上的大跃进，我国今年还大张旗鼓地展开了除四害讲卫生的爱国卫生运动，消灭了成亿只的老鼠和麻雀，几千万斤的蚊子和苍蝇。所有这些都是六亿五千万人民在党的领导下，鼓足了冲天干劲所取得的辉煌成就。这些成就正在使我国迅速地改变着一穷二白的面貌，向具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家的目标大踏步地前进。
    今年的农业丰产和爱国卫生运动的发展，不仅具有伟大的经济意义和政治意义，而且在科学事业上也有极其深刻的影响。首先，它打破了许多旧的论点，对科学工作作出了极有价值的贡献。以深耕为中心的农业上的八字宪法，为土壤、植物生理、农业耕作、作物栽培、农业机械等学科，提出了新的方向。中国农民长期以来使用有机肥料的特点，使肥料学得到了新的发展；广东省和全国各地群众性的土壤普查鉴定和改良土壤工作，以中国农民的丰富的土壤知识和经验，充实并发展了中国的土壤科学。
    其中为大家所熟知的，如马同义的土壤深翻法，蒋少芳和其他很多同志用远缘杂交方法所创造的各式各样的作物品种，王保京的田间设计学，张秋香的棉花田间管理，李始美的对白蚁生活史及其防治方法的研究，曹依秀的对野鼠生活习性及其防治方法的研究等等，都应当是今年科学研究上的重要贡献。
    在爱国卫生运动方面，我们在人类历史中第一次采取大规模的群众性的行动，向危害人类最大的疾病和四害进攻，已取得了辉煌的成就。这给医药卫生工作展开了宏伟的前景。许多新的创造发明，不胜枚举。这些贡献和其他战线上的科学技术的创造一样，打破了人们对于科学的神秘观点，显示出人们的智慧与创造力，经过共产主义的思想大解放，是无比的丰富和雄伟的。
    农业丰产的事实同时更说明了我国农民几千年来在农业生产实践中所积累的丰富经验，是一个智慧的海洋，是一个取之不尽，用之不竭的知识宝库。科学是从实践中产生的，科学只有通过实践才能认识自然的规律，并运用自然的规律促进自然的改造，以达到为人类造福的目的。因之，科学工作必须联系实际，必须走群众路线，这在农业丰产的实际中得到了无可争辩的实证。许多科学工作者对这一层体会很深，表示一定要放下架子，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，拜群众为老师，虚心向群众学习，为发展我国的科学事业和生产建设事业贡献出一切力量。
    今天科学已经不再是少数人的“专利品”了，科学真正为人民群众所掌握的伟大时代已经到来。全国各省、市、自治区都在大办科学，许多县和人民公社都在搞科学研究工作，有些省已经建成了科学研究网。显然，今年我国的工农业和爱国卫生运动的巨大成绩是和人民群众开始掌握科学这件事分不开的。今后，必须进一步努力贯彻执行知识分子和工农群众相结合、科学技术和生产实践相结合、普及和提高相结合的方针，使群众性的技术革命运动和专业的科学研究工作结合起来，以更大的规模和更快的速度蓬勃发展，更有力地支援生产建设和文化建设。
    1958年即将过去，更大跃进的1959年马上就要到来了。党的八届六中全会已经发出新的响亮的号召，要在明年取得一个更大的胜利。工业上，钢的产量要增加到一千八百万吨，煤的产量要增加到三亿八千万吨。农业上粮食产量要增加到一万零五百亿斤左右，棉花产量要增加到一亿担左右。为了实现这些任务，我们必须遵从党的教导：在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，既要有冲天的干劲，又要有科学的分析精神，把实事求是的精神和革命热情结合起来，反对浮夸，反对隐瞒缺点，为胜利地超额完成党和国家给予我们的任务而奋斗。让我预祝全体代表们在明年的农业生产和爱国卫生运动中取得更大的成绩，同时，也对科学事业作出更多的贡献。
