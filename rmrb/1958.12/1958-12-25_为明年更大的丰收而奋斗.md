The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Production Units is opening in the capital today. This is a victorious gathering of the great leap forward in agricultural production in our country in 1958. Active participants in the patriotic health campaign are also attending this conference. With immense joy, on the occasion of the opening of this conference of representatives, we extend our heartfelt congratulations and high respect to all farmers and agricultural workers who have achieved brilliant results on the agricultural front and in the patriotic health campaign, as well as to the activists in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene.

Through the heroic struggle of 500 million farmers over the past year, agricultural production in 1958 has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to recent estimates, this year's national grain output will increase from 370 billion jin last year to about 750 billion jin, and cotton output will increase from 32.8 million dan last year to 67 million dan. These two figures for increased production have far exceeded the total increase in grain and cotton in our country during the First Five-Year Plan period (grain increased by a total of 61.2 billion jin and cotton increased by a total of 6.73 million dan in the past five years). The output of oil crops and other agricultural products also increased significantly in 1958. This year, not only have many small plots of high-yield land with yields of several thousand jin or even more than ten thousand jin of grain per mu appeared everywhere, but there are also large areas of high-yield land everywhere. Many low-yield areas across the country have become high-yield areas; the original high-yield areas have also experienced substantial (in some areas, several-fold) growth. On a national scale, the tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956-1967 have been basically achieved in terms of grain and cotton. The hardworking and brave Chinese farmers, under the leadership of the Party, have completely refuted the pessimistic view that "agricultural production cannot develop at high speed" with the ironclad facts of a bumper harvest, and have also dispelled the concerns of some well-intentioned people about our country's "large population and small land area." The bourgeoisie's "population theory" and the imperialists' curses about our country's inability to solve the food problem have completely gone bankrupt. This year's great leap forward in agriculture in our country has not only great economic significance but also far-reaching political influence and scientific value.

In the high tide of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the people's commune movement emerged, and rural areas across the country realized people's communes in a very short period. The people's communes, which combine workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrate government and commune, developed in the great leap forward in agriculture, and the establishment of people's communes has opened up new and broad paths for the socialist economic and cultural construction of rural areas. From the development direction of the people's communes, we see the prospect of the gradual industrialization of rural areas, the gradual transition from collective ownership in agriculture to ownership by the whole people, the gradual transition from socialist "distribution according to work" to communist "distribution according to need," the gradual reduction and even elimination of differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor, and the gradual reduction and even elimination of the state's internal functions.

This year's great leap forward in socialist construction in rural China is the result of the selfless labor of 500 million farmers with soaring enthusiasm. Why do the vast numbers of farmers have such unprecedented soaring enthusiasm? This is because we have implemented putting politics in command and the mass line. More than a year ago, our Party launched a nationwide rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle, and also conducted socialist education among the vast numbers of farmers, and then put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In this way, not only was the socialist position in the countryside greatly consolidated, and the right-leaning conservative ideas such as "agricultural backwardness theory" and "theory of conditions only" were criticized, but also the vast numbers of cadres and farmers clearly recognized the direction of building socialism, greatly improved their socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm, and fully developed their enthusiasm and creativity. This laid the political and ideological foundation for the great leap forward in agricultural production. At the same time, on the basis of rectification, the relationship between leaders and the masses has improved, not only can many cadres appear as ordinary laborers and discuss matters with the masses, but also a large number of cadres have been sent to the countryside to eat, live, and work with the masses; rural cadres generally cultivate experimental fields, go deep into reality, and specifically guide production. Through experimental fields, many cadres have mastered the laws of agricultural production, better lead agricultural production, and thus can, together with the masses, accumulate rich experience and create amazing miracles in water conservancy construction, soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation and production, seed improvement, tool reform, field management, and other aspects. This has laid a reliable material foundation for achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture.

The victory on the agricultural front in 1958 is unprecedented and encouraging; however, we must not be complacent because of this. This year, we have indeed done great things in agriculture that have not been accomplished in the past many years, but we must also calmly see that there are also shortcomings in our agricultural work. For example, the leap forward in agricultural production in various regions is still very uneven. Some regions have doubled grain production, while grain growth in some regions is relatively small; even in regions where the grain problem has been basically solved, coarse grains or potatoes generally account for a large proportion, and fine grains have not yet passed the test. From the perspective of product types, grain and cotton generally leap forward quickly, oil crops and other cash crops do not increase much, and the diversified economy of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has not been fully developed. Therefore, the task before us is to take the great victory on the agricultural front in 1958 as the starting point for a new leap forward, and make persistent efforts to further comprehensively develop our country's agriculture.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has put forward new combat tasks to the people of our country: to reach 1,050 billion jin of grain next year, an increase of 300 billion jin over this year, and to reach 100 million dan of cotton, an increase of 33 million dan over this year. This is a grand and arduous task, and it is also a task that can be completed and overfulfilled.

Farmers across the country should continue to go all out to ensure the realization of grain and cotton production increase targets and to ensure the rapid increase in the production of other crops. To do this, we must firmly grasp the eight aspects of increasing production: water conservancy, fertilizer, soil improvement, promotion of fine varieties, close planting, tool reform, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and field management. These are the most important material guarantees for achieving increased production. One of the characteristics of agricultural work in various regions in 1958 was that the later it got, the greater the enthusiasm of the people, and the more adequate the measures to increase production, and the greater the bumper harvest of various crops was finally achieved. Therefore, people call this situation "decisive victory after tomorrow." This is because the high tide of agricultural production appeared after the sowing of wheat and rapeseed, and the results of water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and production, soil improvement, etc., have not had time to be fully applied to the production of crops in the first half of the year. Now the situation is very different. We can fully utilize the results of various constructions over the past year at the beginning of the next agricultural production year, thoroughly implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and formulate and adopt comprehensive and consistent proactive measures. This can prevent the situation of slackness first and tightness later in agricultural production, and strive for a bumper harvest of crops in all seasons next year in a step-by-step and more fully prepared manner.

In 1958, the large-scale emergence of large-area high-yield fields, and the accumulation of rich experience in this area, have enabled us to find a new direction for accelerating the development of agriculture. This is what the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee proposed: "Gradually change shallow plowing and extensive cultivation, and extensive planting with low yields into deep plowing and intensive cultivation, and less planting with high yields, realize the gardenization of cultivation and the mechanization and electrification of the production process, greatly increase the yield per unit area, increase labor productivity, and gradually reduce the cultivated land area and the labor force used in agriculture." Next year will be the first year for various regions to prepare for the implementation of this new farming system. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to conduct thorough planning and proper arrangements based on the specific conditions of all aspects. We must not only oppose the conservative thinking of being attached to the old farming system and unwilling to actively implement reforms, but also prevent the rash practice of recklessly reducing too much cultivated land regardless of actual conditions; we must not only focus on large-area high-yield fields, but also cannot relax the production of general farmland. We must adopt a positive attitude towards the new farming system and carry it out with preparation.

In the rural economic work in 1959, all regions should also conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production. That is to say, we must not only accelerate the development of agriculture, but also accelerate the development of industry; we must not only accelerate the development of grain production, but also accelerate the increase in the yield of cash crops such as cotton, hemp, oil, sugar, tea, tobacco, vegetables, and medicinal materials; we must not only accelerate the increase in the yield of these crops, but also accelerate the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. "Just like on the industrial front, there must be a full-scale revolution in the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and completely change the face of the entire agricultural front" ("Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes"). At present, in terms of industry, we must pay special attention to the development of agricultural tool factories, fertilizer factories, agricultural product processing factories, and handicraft workshops that serve agriculture. With the development of industry, the development of agriculture, and the development of cash crops and sideline production, people's communes can sell more and more products, which can not only meet their own needs but also meet the needs of the market, and increase the commune's cash income.

The experience of the great leap forward in 1958 tells us that firmly and unswervingly implementing the Party's general line for socialism is an important guarantee for striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production. Because only by constantly opposing conservatism, going all out, aiming high, liberating the mind, and breaking superstitions can we fully develop the subjective initiative of hundreds of millions of people and make our cause gallop forward like a fast horse. Of course, we Marxists emphasize developing subjective initiative, not advocating blind and reckless actions, but striving to maximize people's subjective initiative on the basis of mastering the objective laws of things' development, and promoting our cause at high speed. Therefore, we must have both a high degree of enthusiasm for socialist construction and maintain a sober mind. In this way, we can conduct realistic and scientific analysis of various complex situations in our work. When planning agricultural production for next year, each region and each people's commune should fully consider the complex relationships between the various aspects within and outside agriculture, realistically analyze the various favorable and unfavorable conditions, make the indicators advanced and the measures active and reliable, and achieve "ten points of indicators and twelve points of measures." In this way, our country's agriculture will surely continue to develop rapidly on a solid and reliable basis next year.

In order to realize the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959 and accelerate the speed of socialist construction, all regions should, in accordance with the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, seize the five months from December 1958 to April 1959, closely combine the tasks of winter and spring production, conduct a rectification work on the people's communes, correctly solve the problems of production, distribution, life, and organization of the people's communes, effectively improve the management of the communes, and at the same time further improve the communist ideological consciousness of all members, greatly promote the mass line and the style of seeking truth from facts, and do a good job in both production and life. By doing a good job in these rectification works, we will be able to more closely unite all farmers and realize the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

### 为明年更大的丰收而奋斗

    为明年更大的丰收而奋斗
    全国农业生产先进单位代表会议今天在首都开幕了。这是1958年我国农业生产大跃进的胜利的大会师。参加这次大会的还有爱国卫生运动的积极分子。我们怀着万分喜悦的心情，乘这次代表会议开幕的时候，向农业战线上和爱国卫生运动中获得辉煌成就的全体农民和农业工作者以及除四害讲卫生的积极分子，致以衷心的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    经过五亿农民一年来的英勇奋斗，1958年农业生产获得了史无前例的大丰收。根据最近的预计，今年全国粮食产量将由去年的三千七百亿斤增加到七千五百亿斤左右，棉花产量将由去年的三千二百八十万担增加到六千七百万担左右。这两项增产数字都已远远地超过了第一个五年计划期间我国粮食、棉花增产数字的总和（在过去五年当中粮食总共增加了六百十二亿斤，棉花总共增加了六百七十三万担）。1958年的油料作物和其他农产品的产量也有显著的增长。今年各地不仅出现了许多亩产几千斤以至超过万斤粮食的小块的高额丰产田，而且到处都有大面积的高额丰产田。全国有很多低产区变成了高产区；原来的高产区也有大幅度的（有些地区是成倍地）增长。就全国来说，在粮食和棉花方面已经基本上实现了1956年——1967年全国农业发展纲要所规定的任务。勤劳勇敢的我国农民，在党的领导下，用大丰收的铁的事实，完全驳倒了“农业生产不能高速度发展”的悲观论，也解除了某些好心人关于我国“人口多、土地少”的忧虑。资产阶级的“人口论”和帝国主义关于我国不能解决粮食问题的诅咒，都彻底破产了。今年我国农业的大跃进，不仅具有巨大的经济意义，而且具有深远的政治影响和科学价值。
    在农业生产大跃进的高潮中，出现了人民公社化运动，全国农村在很短期间实现了人民公社化。工农商学兵相互结合、政社合一的人民公社是在农业大跃进中发展起来的，而人民公社的建立，又为农村社会主义的经济和文化建设开拓了新的广阔的道路。我们从人民公社的发展方向上，看到了农村逐步工业化的前景，农业中的集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制的前景，社会主义“按劳分配”逐步过渡到共产主义的“按需分配”的前景，城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别逐步缩小以至消失的前景，以及国家对内职能逐步缩小以至消失的前景。
    今年我国农村社会主义建设的大跃进，是五亿农民以冲天的干劲进行了忘我的劳动的结果。为什么广大农民有这样空前的冲天干劲？这是因为实行了政治挂帅和群众路线。一年多以前，我们党发动了全民整风运动和反右派斗争，又在广大农民中进行了社会主义教育，接着又提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。这样，不仅大大巩固了社会主义在农村的阵地，批判了“农业落后论”、“唯条件论”等右倾保守思想，而且使广大干部和农民明确地认识了建设社会主义的方向，大大提高了他们的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情，充分发挥了他们的积极性和创造性。这就在政治上和思想上为农业生产的大跃进奠定了基础。同时，在整风的基础上，领导和群众的关系改善了，不仅许多干部都能以普通劳动者姿态出现，有事同群众商量；而且大批干部下放农村，与群众同吃同住同劳动；农村干部普遍种试验田，深入实际，具体地指导生产。通过试验田，许多干部掌握了农业生产规律，更好地领导农业生产，因而能够同群众一起，在水利建设、改良土壤、积肥造肥、改良种籽、工具改革、田间管理以及其他方面，积累了丰富的经验，创造了惊人的奇迹。这就为实现农业大丰收奠定了可靠的物质基础。
    1958年农业战线上的胜利是空前的，是令人欢欣鼓舞的；但是，我们决不能因此自满。今年我们在农业方面的确干出了过去多少年没有干成的大事情，但也要冷静地看到我们的农业工作中也还有美中不足的地方。例如，各地的农业生产的跃进还很不平衡，有些地区粮食产量成倍地增长了，也有些地区的粮食增长幅度却比较小；就是在粮食问题已经基本上解决了的地区，一般也是粗粮或薯类比重很大，细粮方面并未过关。从产品种类来看，一般是粮食、棉花跃进很快，油料和其他经济作物增产不多，农林牧副渔的多种经济还没有得到全面的发展。因此，摆在我们面前的任务，就是要把1958年农业战线的巨大胜利作为新的跃进的起点，再接再厉，使我国农业得到进一步的全面发展。
    党的八届六中全会已经向我国人民提出了新的战斗任务：明年粮食要达到一万零五百亿斤，即比今年增加三千亿斤，棉花要达到一亿担，即比今年增加三千三百万担。这是一个宏伟的苦战的任务，也是一个能够完成和超额完成的任务。
    全国农民应当继续鼓足干劲，保证粮食、棉花增产指标的实现，保证其他农作物的迅速增产。为了做到这一点，就必须紧紧抓住水利、肥料、土壤改良、推广优良品种、密植、工具改革、防治病虫害、田间管理这八个方面的增产措施，这是实现增产的最重要的物质保证。1958年各地农业工作中的特点之一，是越到后期，人们的干劲越大，增产措施也越充分，最后取得了各种作物的大丰收。因此，人们把这种情形叫作“后天决胜”。这是因为农业生产高潮是在麦类和油菜播种之后出现的，而水利建设、积肥造肥、改良土壤等等成果还来不及充分地运用到上半年的农作物生产中去。现在情况大不相同了，我们完全可以在下一年度农业生产的开始，就充分利用一年来各种建设的成果，深入地贯彻实施农业上的“八字宪法”，周密地制定和采取贯彻始终的积极措施。这样就可以防止农业生产上的前松后紧的情况，有步骤地更有充分准备地去争取明年各季农作物的大丰收。
    在1958年中，大面积丰产田的大量出现，以及这方面的丰富经验的积累，使我们找到了加速发展农业的新方向。这就是八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中提出的：“逐步改变浅耕粗作、广种薄收为深耕细作、少种多收，实现耕作园田化和生产过程机械化、电气化，大大提高单位面积产量，提高劳动生产率，逐步缩减耕地面积和在农业方面所使用的劳动力”。明年是各地为了实行这种新的耕作制度进行准备的第一年，因此特别需要根据各方面的具体条件进行周密的筹划和妥善的安排，既要反对那种留恋旧的耕作制度而不肯积极实行改革的保守思想，也要防止不顾实际条件一下子退耕过多的耕地的轻率作法；既要大抓大面积丰产田，又不能放松一般农田的生产。对于新的耕作制度既要采取积极态度，又要有准备地进行。
    在1959年的农村经济工作中，各地还应当认真贯彻工业和农业同时并举、自给性生产和商品生产同时并举的方针。这就是说，不仅要加速发展农业，还要加速发展工业，不仅要加速发展粮食生产，还要加速提高棉花、麻类、油料、糖料、茶叶、烟叶、蔬菜、药材等经济作物的产量；不仅要加速增加上述这些农作物的产量，还要加速发展林业、畜牧业、副业和水产业。“如像在工业战线一样，一定要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌”（关于人民公社若干问题的决议）。目前，工业方面，就要特别注意发展为农业服务的农具工厂、肥料工厂、农产品加工厂、手工业作坊。工业发展了，农业发展了，经济作物和副业生产发展了，人民公社就可以有越来越多的产品出售，既能满足自己的需要，又能满足市场的需要，而增加公社的现金收入。
    1958年大跃进的经验告诉我们：坚定不移地贯彻执行党的社会主义总路线，是争取农业生产大跃进的重要保证。因为只有不断地反对保守，鼓足干劲，力争上游，解放思想，破除迷信，才能把亿万人民的主观能动性充分发挥出来，使我们的事业如快马般向前奔腾。当然，我们马克思主义者强调发挥主观能动性，并不是提倡盲目地乱冲乱闯，而是要力求在掌握事物发展的客观规律的基础上，最大限度地发挥人的主观能动性，用高速度推进我们的事业。因此，我们既要有对于社会主义建设的高度热情，又要保持冷静的头脑。这样，我们就能对于工作中的各种复杂的情况进行实事求是的科学分析。每个地区，每个人民公社在规划明年农业生产的时候，都应当充分地考虑到农业内部和外部的各方面的复杂关系，实事求是地分析各种有利条件和不利条件，使指标先进而措施又积极可靠，做到“十分指标、十二分措施”。这样，明年我国的农业一定能在坚实可靠的基础上，继续飞跃发展。
    为了实现1959年工业和农业生产的大跃进，加快社会主义建设的速度，各地应当根据党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，抓紧1958年12月至1959年4月的五个月时间，紧密结合冬季和春季的生产任务，对人民公社进行一次整社工作，正确地解决人民公社的生产、分配、生活和组织方面的问题，切实改善公社的经营管理，同时进一步提高全体社员的共产主义思想觉悟，大大发扬群众路线和实事求是的作风，既搞好生产，也搞好生活。做好这些整社工作，我们就能够更加紧密地团结全体农民，实现1959年农业生产的大跃进。
