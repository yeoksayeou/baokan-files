Xingtai, December 14 (People's Daily) – The Xingtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principle of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture after the people's communes were established, is guiding the people's communes to implement a new social division of labor.

The development of industry, with steel as the key link, after the establishment of people's communes in Xingtai County has brought new requirements for the social division of labor in rural areas. The county and commune steel industry needs to invest more than 20,000 laborers, and another 7,000 laborers are needed to regularly transport materials for steel production. In addition, the national construction requires the transfer of workers and long-term road construction and water conservancy projects require labor. A total of 50,000 laborers are needed, accounting for about half of the county's original 110,000 male and female laborers. How to transfer these laborers needs to be properly planned. On the other hand, with the development of the commune movement, more than 40,000 women laborers who were previously burdened by children and housework have been put into production after the universal implementation of "Four Transformations" throughout the county. At the same time, due to the implementation of the educational policy of combining education with labor production, more than 18,000 primary and secondary school students in the county can also participate in industrial and agricultural production and construction for part of the time. The rural labor force has been supplemented by many new forces, and how to give full play to their role needs to be comprehensively arranged. Therefore, after the establishment of the people's communes, a new social division of labor was placed before the cadres and masses of Xingtai County.

Based on the above situation, the Xingtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an emergency meeting of commune party secretaries and work team leaders in late September to analyze the labor division situation after the establishment of communes, help cadres understand the nature of the current labor shortage, and study solutions. Subsequently, a county-wide broadcast meeting was held to explain to the masses the great significance of the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture and the solutions to the labor shortage. Then, the masses were mobilized to speak out, debate, and offer suggestions. In the nationwide discussion, the masses put forward more than 120,000 opinions on labor specialization, collaborative support, and other aspects. The county party committee also mobilized commune teams to make plans and determine the number and list of laborers to be transferred. In order to prevent neglecting one thing while attending to another, the county and commune party committees considered industrial and agricultural production together and made arrangements simultaneously.

The Xingtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the following methods to organize rural labor for social division of labor in accordance with the requirements of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. First, appropriately divide labor and specialize according to the nature of the tasks. In addition to the 8,000 workers who were transferred to participate in national industrial construction and have been determined as long-term workers, the county party committee has determined about 20,000 laborers engaged in steel production as fixed workers. In addition, more than 6,000 laborers engaged in longer-term construction (such as reservoir and road construction) are also gradually being fixed. In this way, labor organizations in industry, agriculture, and transportation have been largely established, and their own organizational order has been established. Second, in carrying out the division of labor and specialization, backbone forces were appropriately matched. About half of the original party members and members of the Youth League in rural areas were transferred to industry, and about half remained in agricultural production. Each production team retained one or two of the original team leaders to continue leading agricultural production. When transferring industrial laborers, experienced old farmers were left in each village, retaining the backbone of the agricultural front. Third, rural labor should be used as professionally as possible. During the autumn harvest and wheat sowing, each village organized several temporary specialized teams for autumn harvest, land turning, manure delivery, and sowing according to the labor content. After the autumn harvest and wheat sowing, specialized teams for wheat field management and other production organizations were established. In addition to clear division of labor and clear responsibilities, this is mainly because it is easier to use talents according to their abilities and accumulate experience and learn technology after the reduction of skilled labor in rural areas. Fourth, establish a backbone labor organization and maintain an appropriate mobile force to allocate labor at the commune and county levels. After many strong laborers were transferred to industrial construction, agriculture still maintained labor organizations of seven field corps and six hundred and ninety-five combat companies. During wheat sowing, the county and commune mobilized these laborers and carried out four county and commune-level raids, and timely completed the drought-resistant and rush-planting and other assault production tasks. Fifth, help new laborers quickly learn production technology. During wheat sowing, the county trained more than 2,000 key workers in operating seed drills, including 700 women who had newly joined the labor force and learned the technology of operating seed drills. Laborers participating in steelmaking also organized red and expert schools to learn production technology while working. In addition, the county also established red and expert schools and technical research groups at the commune and county levels, absorbing more than 17,000 people to regularly carry out technical learning.

After more than two months of efforts, the work of arranging social labor division in Xingtai County has come to an end. The labor used in industry, agriculture, and other production and construction has been largely fixed, and their own organizational order has been established. The labor force has also expanded. The number of people participating in industrial and agricultural production in the county has reached more than 145,000, accounting for 67% of the total population. Except for the old, young, sick, and disabled, everyone basically participates in labor. Because the labor force was arranged in a timely manner, the county and commune steel industry bases have rapidly grown, and agriculture has also completed the autumn harvest and wheat sowing tasks in a timely manner, and timely carried out wheat field production management.

Tianjin, December 14 (People's Daily) – After the establishment of the Hongqi People's Commune in Ji County, Hebei Province, in the new situation of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, it reorganized the labor division of commune members, implemented replacing men with women in many industries, solved the difficulty of labor shortage, and promoted the development of various economies.

Not long after the establishment of the Hongqi People's Commune in Xuzhuang Township, Ji County, it established 4,200 medium-sized and small factories, 32 livestock farms, 10,000-chicken farms, pig farms, and agricultural experimental farms, and established 109 supply and marketing outlets, sales points, and credit stations. In the development of the above-mentioned industries, due to the lack of new understanding of the social division of labor after the establishment of communes, among the 5,150 laborers used, 4,628 male laborers were used, accounting for 90%, and only 522 female laborers were used, accounting for only 10%. In addition to the transfer of 5,100 strong laborers, the number of male laborers who can regularly participate in agricultural production in the commune only accounted for about 20% of the total number of male laborers. Due to the lack of technically skilled backbone, production was affected to a certain extent.

Based on the above situation, the commune party committee studied the new situation of the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production and the shortage of labor. While grasping tool reform, it also adopted the measures of "replacing men with women" and replacing strong with weak to vigorously engage in "24 personnel" in early September, organized female laborers to participate in various industries, and allocated social labor within their capabilities. Thanks to the correct leadership of the commune party committee, women laborers have now been assigned to most of the more than 20 occupations such as business personnel, postmen, telephone operators, cooks, barbers, breeders, sewing workers, projectionists, broadcasters, educators, hospital nurses, mechanics, health workers, credit officers, painters, inseminators, child care workers, midwives, accountants, copyists, meteorologists, pharmacists, agricultural technicians, nursery workers, administrators, librarians, glass installers in “One pond” (bath pond), “Four transformations” (sewing mechanization, mechanical quick grinding, childcare, dining hall), “Five courtyards” (hospital, happiness courtyard, maternity hospital, cinema, opera house), "Ten major breeding" (breeding pigs, breeding chickens, breeding bees, breeding silkworms, breeding fish, breeding ducks, breeding young animals, breeding breeding animals, breeding rabbits, breeding crabs), "Twenty-four factories" (agricultural experimental factory, agricultural tool repair factory, rice and flour processing factory, shoe factory, food processing factory, cement factory, flour mill, winery, pig farm, laundry, nursery factory, waste product processing factory, superior seed breeding factory, knitting factory, textile factory, sewing factory, fertilizer factory, printing factory, machine repair factory, all-season fresh vegetable factory, steel factory, kiln factory, pottery pipe factory, etc.). Of the original more than 4,000 male laborers in these units, 835 were retained as the backbone, and the others were replaced by women. Now, female laborers account for 83% of the total number of people in these industries. The 3,793 male laborers who were transferred were, in addition to a part supporting steel production, completely put into agricultural production and basic construction.

After more than a month of practice, this commune has achieved great results in various tasks after replacing men with women and adjusting the labor division of commune members. In addition to systematically transporting 5,000 strong male laborers to the steel industry, it also completed the task of deep plowing and wheat planting of 50,000 mu six days ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity. Due to the replacement of men with women and the rational organization of labor, not only was the production of the commune done well, but also 1,500 male laborers, 200 double-铧 plows, and eight tractors were drawn to help other communes deep plow and plant more than 13,000 mu of wheat. Replacing men with women and adjusting the division of labor of commune members have played a positive role in mobilizing women's enthusiasm for production, improving women's economic and political status, and improving service industries.

In the "replacing men with women" adjustment of the division of labor of commune members, the Hongqi Commune first conducted repeated propaganda and education on the great significance of "replacing men with women" among cadres and the masses, and organized large-scale debates on topics such as why "replacing men with women" and how to treat the division of labor in revolutionary work to unify understanding and improve awareness. The commune party committee also organized a "replacing men with women" committee led by the first secretary, with the township women's federation as the main body, and absorbed relevant departments to specifically lead this work. In addition, party committee members and township and commune cadres were contracted at all levels to carry out the work separately. When selecting female laborers, attention was also paid to good composition, good thinking, good labor, and appropriate age and culture. Based on the principle of benefiting production and giving play to the expertise of men and women, uniform allocation was carried out according to the nature and scope of the work of each industry. In the adjustment of the social division of labor, the women leaders supplemented to various industries also worked and practiced at the same time to accelerate the improvement of their business capabilities.

    本报天津14日电  中共邢台县委员会根据人民公社化后工农业并举的方针，指导人民公社实行新的社会劳动分工。
    邢台县人民公社化后以钢为纲的工业建设的发展，给农村的社会劳动分工带来了新的要求。县、社的钢铁工业需要投入两万多名劳力，另外还需要七千名劳力经常为钢铁搞运输，再加上国家建设的外调工人和长期修公路搞水利的劳力，共需抽调劳力五万人，约占全县原有的十一万名男女劳力的一半。这些劳力如何抽调，必需作适当的打算。另一方面，随着公社化运动的开展，全县普遍实行“四化”后，四万多名过去被孩子家务拖累的妇女劳力投入了生产；同时，由于教育与劳动生产结合的教育方针的贯彻，全县一万八千多高小和中学的学生，也能以一部分时间参加工农业生产建设。农村劳动力补充了许多生力军，怎样发挥他们的作用，需要作全面的安排。因此，在人民公社化后，一次新的社会劳动分工，就摆在了邢台县干部群众的面前。
    中共邢台县委根据上述情况，在9月下旬召开的公社党委书记、工作组长紧急会议上，分析公社化后劳动分工方面的形势，帮助干部认识当前劳动力紧张的性质，研究解决的方法。接着召开了全县的广播大会，向群众讲明工农业同时并举的巨大意义和解决劳动力紧张的办法。然后发动群众鸣放辩论，献计献策。在全民性的讨论当中，群众曾提出了劳动专业化、协作支援等十二万多条意见。县委又发动社队作规划，定出抽调劳力的数目和名单。为了防止顾此失彼，县、社党委对工农业生产一同考虑，同时部署安排。
    中共邢台县委是采取以下办法，根据工农业同时并举的要求，组织农村劳力进行社会分工的。一、根据任务性质，适当进行分工分业。除外调参加国家工业建设的八千名工人已确定为长期工外，县委已将两万名左右参加搞钢铁的劳力，确定为固定工人。此外，对时间较长的建设（如修水库修公路）劳力六千多人，也逐步固定起来。这样，就大体确立了工业、农业、交通运输方面劳动组织，各自建立起自己的组织秩序。二、在进行分工分业时，适当的搭配了骨干力量。原来农村的党团员，一半左右转工业，一半左右坚持农业生产，每个生产队，都保留着原来的一两名队长，继续领导农业生产。在抽调工业劳力时，每个村庄都留下了生产经验丰富的老农，保留住了农业战线上的骨干。三、农村劳力使用尽量专业化。在秋收种麦当中，各村即按劳动内容组织了秋收、翻地、送粪、播种若干临时性的专业队，秋收种麦结束后，又建立了麦田管理等专业队生产组织。这样作，除分工清楚责任明确外，主要是因为农村熟练的劳力减少后，便于量才使用，和积累经验，学习技术。四、建立基干劳力组织，保持适当的机动力量，以社、县为单位调配劳力。许多壮劳力转入工业建设后，农业仍保持七个野战兵团、六百九十五个战斗连的劳力组织。在种麦当中，县、社曾调动这些劳力，进行了四次县社范围的突击，及时完成了抗旱抢种等突击性的生产任务。五、帮助新投入劳动的人，迅速学会生产技术。在小麦播种当中，全县曾训练了两千多名扶耧骨干，其中即有七百名新投入劳动队伍的妇女，学会了扶耧播种的技术。参加炼钢的劳力，也组织了红专学校，边劳动边学习生产技术。另外，这县还以社、县为单位，建立了红专学校和技术研究组，吸收一万七千多人经常进行技术学习。
    经过两个多月的努力，目前邢台县安排社会劳动分工的工作已告一段落。工业、农业和其他的生产建设所用的劳力已经大体固定下来，并且各自建起组织秩序。劳动队伍也扩大了。全县参加工农业生产的人，已达到十四万五千多人，占到总人口的67％，除了老幼病残外，基本上达到了人人都参加劳动。因为劳力安排及时，县、社钢铁工业基地已迅速成长起来，农业也及时完成了秋收种麦任务，及时开展了麦田的生产管理。
    本报天津14日电  河北省冀县红旗人民公社在人民公社化后工农业同时并举、农林牧副渔全面发展的新形势下，重新安排社员的劳动分工，在许多行业中实行以女代男，解决了劳力紧张的困难，促进了各种经济的发展。
    冀县徐庄乡红旗人民公社建社不久，即建立了中、小型的工厂四千二百座，畜牧场、双万鸡滩、养猪场、农业试验场等三十二处，分设供销门市部、销售点、信用站等一百零九处。在上述各个行业的发展当中，由于对公社化后社会劳动分工缺乏新的认识，在所占用的五千一百五十名劳力当中，使用的男劳力即达四千六百二十八名，占90％，妇女劳力只有五百二十二名，仅占10％，再加上五千一百名壮劳力的外调，因此，全社能够经常参加农业生产的男劳力，仅占男劳力总数的20％左右。由于缺乏技术熟练的骨干，曾使生产受到一定影响。
    根据上述情况，公社党委曾研究了工农业生产飞跃发展与劳力紧张缺乏的新情况，在抓住工具改革的同时，又于9月上旬采取了“抽男换女”以弱代强大搞“二十四员”的措施，组织了妇女劳力参加各个行业，分配其力所能及的社会劳动。由于公社党委的正确领导，现在已将“一塘”（洗澡塘）、“四化”（缝纫机械化、机械快磨化、托儿化、食堂化）、“五院”（医院、幸福院、妇产院、电影院、戏院）、“十大养”（养猪、养鸡、养蜂、养蚕、养鱼、养鸭、养幼畜、养种畜、养兔、养蟹），“二十四厂”（农业试验厂、农具修配厂、米面加工厂、制鞋厂、食品加工厂、水泥厂、制粉厂、制酒厂、养猪场、洗染厂、苗圃厂、废品加工厂、优种繁殖厂、针织厂、纺织厂、缝纫厂、化肥厂、印刷厂、机器修配厂、四季鲜菜厂、钢铁厂，窑厂、缸瓦管厂等）中的营业员、邮递员、话务员、炊事员、理发员、饲养员、缝纫员、放映员、广播员、教养员、医院护理员、机械员、保健员、信贷员、油漆员、配种员、保育员、助产员、会计员、刻写员、气象员、司药员、农业技术员、苗圃员、管理员、图书讲解员、玻璃安装员等二十几种职业，大都换上了妇女劳力。原来这些单位的四千多名男劳力，除留下八百三十五名作为骨干外，其他都由妇女代替，现在，女劳力已占这些行业总人数的83％。先后抽出的三千七百九十三名男劳力，除一部分支援钢铁生产外，其他完全投入农业生产和基本建设。
    这个社以女代男、调整社员劳动分工后，经过一个多月的实践，在各项工作中已经收到很大的效果。除有计划地给钢铁工业输送了五千名男壮劳力，还按质按量提前六天超额完成五万亩的深耕种麦任务。由于以女代男，合理的组织劳力，不仅作好了本社的生产，还抽出了一千五百名男劳力，二百张双铧犁、八架拖拉机帮助其他公社深耕种麦一万三千余亩。以女代男、调整社员劳动分工，对调动妇女的生产积极性，提高妇女的经济政治地位和改善服务性行业等工作，都起了积极作用。
    红旗公社在“抽男换女”调整社员分工当中，首先向干部群众反复进行了“抽男换女”的重大意义的宣传教育，并组织了以为什么要“抽男换女”、怎样对待革命工作的分工等专题的大鸣大放大辩论，统一认识，提高觉悟。公社党委并由第一书记挂帅，以乡妇联为主，吸收有关部门组织了“抽男换女”委员会，专门领导这一工作。另外由党委委员、乡社干部层层包干，分工进行。在选拔女劳力时，还注意了成分好、思想好、劳动好和年龄、文化适宜，本着有利于生产，发挥男女专长的原则，根据各行业工作的性质、范围等情况，进行了统一调配。在调整社会分工当中，还领导补充到各行业的妇女边作边练，加速提高业务能力。
