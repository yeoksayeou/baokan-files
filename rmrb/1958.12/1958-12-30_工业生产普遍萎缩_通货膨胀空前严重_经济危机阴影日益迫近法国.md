Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 29th: This reporter, Yang Xiaonong, reports that France ended a bleak 1958 by announcing the devaluation of the French franc. The French government originally hoped that this financial measure would enhance the competitiveness of French goods in the market against foreign goods. However, like a stimulant for a patient, it precisely illustrates the weakness of France's economic strength.

The capitalist world economic crisis, which began in the United States in the second half of 1957, has already begun to affect France this year. The rise of the de Gaulle government cannot free France from the shadow of the looming crisis.

In recent years, France's industrial production has been rising due to various artificial stimulus measures. However, this year the rate of increase has gradually slowed down, and even has a tendency to fall. Compared with last year, industrial production in the first quarter of this year was still 11% higher than last year, but the second quarter only increased by 8%, and the third quarter only increased by 4.7%. Among them, the production level of many enterprises in September has dropped to the level of the same period last year, and some are even lower than this level.

The sluggish industrial production phenomenon first started in the household appliance and motorcycle manufacturing industries. The former's output in the third quarter of this year has decreased by half compared with the same period last year, and the latter's output decreased by 10% in the first eight months of this year. Then the textile industry also encountered a crisis.

The production of some departments of the machinery industry began to shrink in the second quarter, and the entire industry was affected by the third quarter. In recent months, orders for the machinery industry have decreased by 15% compared with last year.

The shrinking of the machinery industry has affected the metallurgical industry. Steel production in the third quarter of this year has been lower than the level of the same period last year. By November, steel production had fallen to only 1,157,000 tons, a decrease of 100,000 tons compared with the same period last year; while the total output of the metallurgical industry decreased by 7% compared with the same period last year.

France's key industry, the automobile industry, began to show signs of depression from April. Now, orders for this industry have decreased by 30% to 50% compared with last year, and the total output in the third quarter has decreased by 6% compared with the first quarter.

The universal shrinking of industrial production is also reflected in the decrease in power consumption. Coal production in the third quarter decreased by 2.5% compared with the same period last year, while coal reserves still increased from 6,480,000 tons in July to 7,225,000 tons in September, which is equivalent to about one-eighth of last year's output. If calculated from the beginning of the year, coal reserves have increased by more than 50%.

On the 25th, Il Hirsch, director of the French official economic planning commission, summarized the current situation of French industry, saying: "Inventories are increasing, orders for basic commodities (coal, steel) are decreasing, and orders for industries producing heavy products (such as machine tools, large electrical equipment, tractors) and public works enterprises are also decreasing."

After the domestic market shrank, the French ruling group tried to find a way out in foreign markets. Over the past year, the French government has tried its best to reduce imports and encourage exports. However, despite the increase of 109.1 billion francs in exports in the first eleven months of this year, the foreign trade deficit still reached 357.5 billion francs. What particularly alarmed the bourgeois newspapers was that the export volume, which had been rising for three months, fell again in November, a decrease of 10% compared with October. These newspapers, in connection with the upcoming "Common Market," anxiously watched the fierce competition France will encounter in foreign markets next year.

Under the above circumstances, enterprises with weak economic strength are unable to maintain their operations, and bankruptcies and liquidations have already occurred. Small enterprises have asked for relaxation of credit; medium-sized enterprises only hope that their inventories can be sold, without seeking to expand production; large enterprises have asked the government to maintain investment and help organize exports.

However, the de Gaulle government, supported by financial oligarchs, prefers to compress national investment and increase the tax burden in order to carry out colonial wars and nuclear arms race. Facing the urgent problem of maintaining industrial production, it merely pins its hopes on "encouraging" private investment. At the same time, in order to cope with the establishment of the "Common Market" and the limited free convertibility of the pound sterling, it had to announce another devaluation of the French franc and limited free convertibility, in order to勉强地维持法郎的稳定和暂时提高法国货物的竞争力。

From all aspects, in the face of the looming economic crisis, the road that the French ruling class can currently choose is either a "expansion policy" that stimulates inflation, or a "conservation policy" that compresses investment and consumption. However, no matter which method is adopted, it will not bring the "beautiful scenery" they expect. Inflation means the devaluation of the franc, which will bring greater fiscal deficits and financial and economic difficulties; while compressing investment contains the danger of making the already occurring industrial production shrinkage even more serious.

Observers here believe that for de Gaulle, who will enter the Elysee Palace as president, next year will definitely not be as he wishes.

### 工业生产普遍萎缩  通货膨胀空前严重  经济危机阴影日益迫近法国

    工业生产普遍萎缩  通货膨胀空前严重
    经济危机阴影日益迫近法国
    据新华社巴黎29日电  本社记者杨效农报道，法国以宣布法郎贬值结束黯淡的1958年。法国政府原来希望，这种财政手段会增强法国货物在市场上同外国的竞争能力。然而，正如强心针之于病人一样，它正好说明法国经济力量的虚弱。
    在1957年下半年从美国开始的资本主义世界性经济危机，今年已经开始影响到法国，戴高乐政府的上台并不能使法国从日益迫近的危机的阴影中摆脱出来。
    法国近年来靠着各种人为因素的刺激，工业生产一直在上升。但是今年上升的速度已经逐渐放慢，甚至有下跌的趋势。以今年同去年相比，第一季度的工业生产还高于去年11％，但是第二季度就只增加8％，而第三季度则只增加4.7％，其中不少企业9月份的生产水平已经降到去年同期的水平，有的甚至低于这个水平。
    工业生产的不景气现象首先是从家庭用具及摩托车制造业开始的。前者到今年第三季度产量已较去年同期下降一半，后者在今年头8个月中产量下降10％。接着纺织业也碰到危机。
    机械工业的若干部门在第二季度开始出现生产萎缩，到第三季度全业都被波及。最近几个月以来，机械工业的订货量已经比去年减少15％。
    机械工业的萎缩影响了冶金工业。钢产量今年第三季度已经低于去年同期的水平。到11月，钢产量更下降到只有一百一十五万七千吨，比去年同期减少了十万吨；而全部冶金工业产量则比去年同期降低了7％。
    法国关键性的工业汽车工业从4月开始出现不景气现象。现在，这个工业的订货已经比去年减少30％到50％，而第三季度的总产量则比第一季度下降6％。
    工业生产的普遍萎缩还从动力消耗量的下降中反映出来。煤炭第三季度的生产比去年同期减少2.5％，而存煤仍然从7月的六百四十八万吨增加到9月的七百二十二万五千吨，约等于去年产量的八分之一。如果从年初算起，存煤量已经增加了50％以上。
    法国官方的经济计划委员会主任伊尔希25日概括了法国工业现在的情况，他说：“存货正在增加，基本商品（煤、钢）的订货正在下降，生产重型产品（如工作母机、大型的电力装置、拖拉机）的工业和公共工程企业的订货也在下降。”
    国内市场缩小后，法国统治集团力图在国外市场寻求出路，一年来法政府竭力压缩进口，鼓励出口。但是尽管今年头十一个月出口增加了一千零九十一亿法郎，但是对外贸易逆差仍然达三千五百七十五亿法郎。特别引起资产阶级报纸不安的是，上升了三个月的出口额，11月份又下跌，比10月份减少了10％。这些报纸连系起即将开始的“共同市场”，以惊惧的心情注视明年法国将在国外市场上遇到的猛烈竞争。
    在上述情况下，经济力量微弱的企业无法维持，倒闭清算之事已经出现。小企业纷纷要求放宽信用；中等企业但求存货能销售出去，而不图扩大生产；大企业则要求政府维持投资，帮助组织出口。
    但是，为金融寡头支持的戴高乐政府却宁愿压缩国家投资和加重赋税负担以进行殖民战争和核军备竞赛。面对着维持工业生产的迫切问题，它仅仅把希望寄托在“鼓励”私人投资上。同时，为了应付“共同市场”的成立和有限度的英镑自由兑换，它又只好宣布法郎再次贬值和有限度的自由兑换，以勉强维持法郎的稳定和暂时提高法国货物的竞争力。
    从一切方面看来，面对着日益迫近的经济危机，法国统治阶级目前所能选择的道路，要就是刺激通货膨胀的“扩展政策”，要就是压缩投资和压缩消费的“节约政策”。但是，不管采取那种办法都不会带来他们所期待的“美景”。通货膨胀意味着法郎贬值，从而带来更大的财政赤字和财政经济困难；而压缩投资则包含着使已经出现的工业生产萎缩更加严重的危险。
    这里的观察家认为，对于即将以总统身份进入爱丽舍宫的戴高乐，明年绝不会是如意的。
