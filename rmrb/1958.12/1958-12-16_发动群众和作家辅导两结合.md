　　Our factory has very good conditions for carrying out mass creative activities. First, the Party committee attaches great importance to it and has included literary and artistic creation activities in the content of political work; second, our factory is a "no-illiterate factory," and the cultural level of all employees is mostly above junior high school; third, there are a considerable number of literary and artistic activists, as well as creative groups, who have written many literary and artistic works in coordination with various political movements; fourth, there are writers coming to the factory to help.

　　Therefore, after the Municipal Party Committee issued the call to further carry out mass literary and artistic creation activities, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees was high. A comrade from the creative group said: "In the past, I wrote things according to my own pleasure, treating writing as an amateur hobby. Now I feel that I should write as seriously as I do production. Miracles should also appear in literary and artistic creation." Some workers said: "There are countless new people and new things in our factory. How can we rely solely on creative groups? Now, by mobilizing everyone to write, everything can be written." But on the other hand, there are also some incorrect ideas among the masses. Workers in the motorized vehicle workshop said: "It's no problem for me to hit a hammer weighing twenty pounds a hundred times, but it's very difficult to hold a pen"; some people think that their level is not high enough, and it's okay to write general things, but they are afraid that they can't write excellent major works; still others think that production is very tense, and they still have to learn culture, attend philosophy classes, and attend meetings. Where does the time for writing come from? In order to break down superstition, emancipate the mind, and solve some specific difficulties, the Party committee convened a meeting of literary and artistic activists, and widely mobilized employees to write on topics such as "A Day in the Great Leap Forward," "Ten Years of Liberation," and "Factory History." The factory school also combined language teaching to mobilize students to write such articles as compositions, and selected excellent ones to be published in the factory newspaper or sent to newspapers and magazines, and also used the works of the factory's workers that had already been published in newspapers and magazines as supplementary teaching materials.

　　While widely mobilizing the masses to carry out creation, on the basis of the original creative group, several key creative groups were established, topics were selected, creation tasks were assigned, and preparations were made to write more excellent works to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day. The Party committee secretary directly grasped the key creation, and constantly cared about and supervised the activities of the creative group. In the planning of key creations, there were four novels, one film script, and one drama script, of which two novels were personally led by the Party committee propaganda minister and the trade union chairman (Party committee member) to carry out the creation of the writing group.

　　After the writer Wu Qiang came to the factory, he played a great role in promoting mass creative activities. The tutoring methods were also diversified: a literary and artistic creation tutoring class was opened, and a tutoring report was given every week, with contents including creative thinking, creative methods, how to write novels, and analysis of works. He used some relatively simple and easy-to-understand examples to explain the problem, and the workers listened with great interest. In addition, on-site guidance was also given. For example, in order to collect materials, the key creative group held a forum for veteran workers to tell stories, and Comrade Wu Qiang also participated. After the meeting, he helped to cut and point out which materials were acceptable and which were not specific enough. Concrete guidance and assistance were also given in discussing and brewing the novel outline, conceiving characters, and stories.

　　In order to further mobilize and encourage the creative emotions of the masses, we also co-edited a "Pen Meeting" with "Wen Hui Bao," and selected and published relatively excellent works from the masses' creations. These works were also specifically helped and repeatedly revised by writers, so that the authors themselves knew why they should delete, modify, or add. Some worker authors reflected that this greatly improved their writing skills.

　　In our key creation plan, there is a novella about the deeds of the old worker Shao Sanxi. Originally, it was arranged to be written by the creative group. When widely mobilizing the masses to write, Shao Sanxi was very excited. He bought a novel by "Gao Yubao" to read, and also prepared to write an autobiographical novel. After we learned about this situation, we not only encouraged him to create, but also designated the comrade of the creative group who was originally prepared to write about his deeds to help him write. At present, he has started to write part of it. Special personnel are also responsible for contacting the activities of other workshop creative groups, from participating in the discussion of topics to specifically helping with revisions. Select relatively good literary and artistic works from the masses' creations, and conduct analysis and discussion in the creative group to help authors further process and improve them.

　　With the attention and active support of the Party committee, and the guidance and assistance of writers who came to the factory, the creative enthusiasm of the masses was very high, and the literary and artistic atmosphere in the factory was also stronger than before. The creative team is constantly expanding, and the number of employees who participate in literary and artistic study and tutoring lectures is constantly increasing, from more than ten people to fifty or sixty people. Some workers said: "The lectures have been of great help to me. I have initially grasped the way to write novels. In the past, when I wrote, it became a report. Now I know how to write about people." Many people started writing novels after listening to the lectures.

　　Superstitious thinking has also been gradually broken. The employee comrades generally feel that the conditions for creation are too good. The leaders are so concerned and cultivated, and the writers are in our factory, so we can get help at any time. Therefore, some employee comrades have formulated their own creative plans and practice writing every day.

    发动群众和作家辅导两结合
    上海第一印染厂  邢江友
    我厂在开展群众创作活动上具有很好的条件。第一，党委重视，
  已把开展文艺创作活动列入政治工作的内容；第二，我们厂是一个无盲厂，全厂职工文化程度大都在初二以上；第三，有为数不少的文艺积极分子，也有创作组，在配合各项政治运动中，他们曾经写出了很多的文艺作品；第四，有下厂的作家帮助。
    因此，在市委发出进一步开展群众文艺创作活动的号召以后，广大职工热情高涨。一位创作组的同志说：“过去我写东西看自己的高兴，把写作当作业余的爱好，现在我觉得应该要像搞生产一样，认真地去写。在文艺创作上也要出现奇迹。”有的工人说：“咱们厂里新人新事多得无其数，光靠创作组那能行？现在发动大家来写就可以通通写出来了。”但另一方面在群众中也有些不正确的思想。机动车间的工人说：“要我拿二十来磅的榔头打一百下没问题，拿一支笔却感到很吃力了”；有人认为自己水平不高，写一般的东西还可以，要写优秀的大作品怕做不到；还有些人认为生产很紧张，还要学文化，上哲学课，开会，那来的写作时间？为了破除迷信、解放思想和解决一些具体困难问题，党委召开了文艺积极分子会议，并广泛发动职工群众写“大跃进中的一日”、“解放十年”和“工厂史”等题材。厂校也结合语文教学，发动学生写这类文章作为作文，并且挑选优秀的刊在厂报上或送给报刊杂志，同时也把在报刊上已经发表的本厂工人的作品当作辅助教材。
    在广泛发动群众进行创作的同时，在原有创作组的基础上，成立几个重点创作组，选定题材，布置创作任务，准备写出比较优秀的作品来迎接国庆十周年。党委书记直接抓重点创作，时时关心和督促创作组的活动。在重点创作的规划里，有四部小说、一部电影剧本和一个话剧剧本，其中两部小说是党委宣传部长和工会主席（党委委员）亲自领导创作小组进行创作的。
    作家吴强同志下厂以后，在辅导群众创作活动中起了很大的推动作用，辅导的方式也是多样化的：开办了文艺创作辅导学习班，每星期作一次辅导报告，内容有关于创作思想、创作方法、怎样写小说和对作品分析等。他用一些比较通俗易懂的例子来阐述问题，工人听得津津有味。此外还作现场辅导，例如重点创作组为了搜集材料，召开老工人座谈会讲故事，吴强同志也一起参加，会后帮助剪裁，指出那些材料可以，那些不具体。在讨论酝酿小说提纲构思人物故事时，也进行具体辅导和帮助。
    为了进一步发动和鼓舞群众的创作情绪，我们还和“文汇报”合编一期“笔会”，从群众创作中选用比较优秀的作品刊用。这些作品也经过作家的具体帮助和反复修改，使作者本人知道为什么要删改或增加的原因。有的工人作者反映：这样对写作水平提高得很快。
    在我们重点创作的规划中，有一部关于写老工人邵三喜事迹的中篇小说，原来布置由创作组写，在广泛发动群众写作的时候，邵三喜很激动，买了一本“高玉宝”的小说来看，也准备写一本自传体的小说。当我们了解到这个情况后，不但鼓励他创作，还指定原来准备写他事迹的创作组同志帮助他写作，目前已动手写了一部分。对其他车间创作小组的活动，也有专人联系，从参加题材的讨论一直到具体帮助修改。挑选群众创作中比较好的文艺作品，在创作组里进行分析讨论，帮助作者进一步加工提高。
    在党委的重视和积极支持下，以及下厂作家的辅导帮助下，群众的创作热情非常高涨，厂内文艺气氛也比前浓厚了。创作队伍不断扩大，参加文艺学习辅导讲座的职工同志人数不断增加，从原来十多人增加到五六十人。有的工人说：“讲座对自己帮助很大，初步摸到了写小说的门路，过去一写就变成一篇报告，现在懂得怎样写人了”。听了课以后动笔写小说的人很多。
    迷信思想也逐渐打破了。职工同志普遍感到创作的条件太好了，领导这样的关心和培养，作家又在咱们工厂里，随时都可以得到帮助。因此有的职工同志自己订了创作规划，每天练习写作。
