Songs praising the High Praise canteen's happiness pot have filled many baskets, and today we add another canteen song. Ten thousand people sing in unison, praising the High Praise canteen's happiness pot. Drinking the water from the happiness pot fills us with communist ideas; eating the rice from the happiness pot fills us with the drive to reshape mountains and rivers.

    高赞食堂幸福锅山歌唱了几大箩，今朝又添食堂歌。万人同声大歌唱，高赞食堂幸福锅。喝了幸福锅里水，共产主义思想多；吃了幸福锅里饭，干劲冲天盖山河。
