Qingdao, December 4th (By our reporter Bi Wanzhao) The largest factory in Qingdao, the modern Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant, relying on a vigorous mass movement, has overcome the bottleneck of insufficient equipment. In the past ten days or so, it has manufactured 92 indigenous machine tools and equipment of 55 types. This has not only powerfully guaranteed the completion of this year's production plan, but also laid the foundation for a greater leap forward in production next year.

This year, with basically no increase in personnel and equipment, the plant's locomotive production task increased by 57% compared to last year, and passenger car production increased by more than 61%. In addition, it also has to produce 6,000 tons of smelting equipment and more than 500 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery. To complete this task is obviously very arduous.

In order to solve this problem, the factory leadership decided to manufacture machine tools themselves and add a batch of equipment. Thus, they adopted a method of combining indigenous and foreign techniques, and launched a vigorous mass movement to produce indigenous machine tools and equipment and various simple machine tools.

The Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant is a large, modern factory. At the beginning of the drive to produce indigenous machine tools and equipment, some technicians and middle-level leaders had a formalistic mindset of valuing foreign methods over indigenous ones. They wholeheartedly wanted to make large, universal machine tools. The factory's Party committee selected the machine shop, which had been under capacity for several years and had become a key bottleneck in the plant's production, and used spare time for two days and one night, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, to rush out a special-purpose lathe for threading screws. Then, they held an on-site meeting, using on-site demonstrations and workers' personal experiences, to explain to the workers the importance of indigenous equipment for current production. In the past, the equipment in this workshop was unbalanced and irrationally used. Simple work like threading screws also occupied a universal machine tool and the efficiency was low. The manufacture of the special-purpose indigenous machine tool not only freed up the original universal machine tool, allowing it to play a greater role, but also reached a speed of 2,090 revolutions per minute, increasing efficiency by more than one time. The workers were greatly inspired by this on-site meeting. After the on-site meeting, each workshop, targeting the key bottlenecks in its production, launched a vigorous airing of views, debates, and discussions among the masses, so that all skepticism about indigenous machine tools and the formalistic idea of valuing foreign methods over indigenous ones were criticized. In order to strengthen leadership over this movement, the factory established a leading group for indigenous machine tools and equipment. After mass airing of views and debates, the machine shop and other workshops adjusted their working hours from three shifts to two shifts, taking out one shift to specialize in making indigenous machine tools, combining production tasks with the large-scale production of indigenous machine tools. A magnificent mass movement to produce indigenous machine tools and equipment quickly unfolded in each workshop.

Currently, the factory's mass movement to produce indigenous machine tools and equipment has entered a climax. Not only are workers directly involved in production, engineers and technicians, and management cadres involved in the movement, but also maintenance and miscellaneous personnel. In recent days, several or even more than ten indigenous machine tools and equipment have been born every day; major inventions and creations appear every day. Among the 92 machine tools that have been manufactured, there are not only ten kinds of simple machine tools or iron-wood machine tools, indigenous welding machines, and indigenous oxygen generators; but also medium-sized gantry shears and indigenous gantry planers that can process diameters of four meters. The manufacture of these machines did not require a single piece of material or a single cent from the state; from design to manufacture, it was completely done by the workers themselves. Many indigenous equipment, in terms of utilization efficiency, are even higher than the original foreign equipment. For example, the indigenous gantry shearing machine manufactured by the riveting workshop can cut steel plates four centimeters thick, while the original Japanese-made gantry shears in this workshop could only cut steel plates two and a half centimeters thick.

In the mass production of indigenous machine tools and equipment, the factory firmly grasps the principle of making what is lacking and making as much as is lacking. First, the competent department determines the variety, quantity, and technical requirements for the manufacture of indigenous machine tools and equipment based on the production tasks and equipment capabilities of each workshop and hands them over to each workshop. Each workshop then launches a mass airing of views and debates, aiming at the key production issues of each workshop, and formulates plans for each workshop and each production team, so that the workshops can arrange in a unified manner and proceed in a planned way. Therefore, the factory's mass movement to produce indigenous machine tools and equipment not only has no impact on current production, but also becomes an important measure to ensure the completion of current production tasks and prepare for next year's production.

    大企业潜力无穷
    四方机车厂职工制出大批土机床
    本报青岛4日电  记者毕万兆报道：青岛最大的工厂——现代化的四方机车车辆制造厂依靠轰轰烈烈的群众运动冲破了设备不足的关，在最近十多天造出了五十五种共九十二台土机床土设备。不仅有力地保证了今年生产计划的完成，而且为明年生产更大的跃进打下了基础。
    今年，这个厂在人员设备基本不增加的情况下，机车的生产任务比去年要增加57％，客车增加了61％以上。此外还要生产六千吨的冶炼设备和五百余台排灌机械。要完成这个任务，显然是非常艰巨的。
    为了解决这一问题，工厂领导上决定自己造机床，增加一批设备。于是便采取土洋结合办法，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的大搞土机床土设备和各种简易机床的群众运动。
    四方机车车辆制造厂是一个现代化的大厂。在大搞土机床土设备开始的时候，便有一部分技术人员和中层领导干部，存在着轻土重洋的正规化思想，他们一心一意想做大的万能机床。这个厂的党委便选择几年来一直加工能力不足、成为全厂生产关键的机械车间，以两天一晚的业余时间，用土洋结合办法，赶制出一台旋螺丝的专用车床，然后召开现场会议，以现场表演和工人现身说法的方法，向工人群众说明土设备对当前生产的重要性。过去，这个车间的设备平衡和使用不合理，像旋螺丝这种简单工作，也占一部万能机床，而且使用效率低。专用土机床的制出，不仅可以把原来占用的万能机床解放出来，使其发挥更大的作用，而且每分钟转速达到二千零九十转，效率比过去提高一倍以上。通过这次现场会议，职工群众受到很大的启发。现场会议后，各车间均针对各该车间生产关键，在群众中展开大鸣大放，大争大辩，从而使一切对土机床的怀疑论和轻土重洋的正规化思想受到批判。为了加强对这一运动的领导，厂里成立了土机床土设备领导小组。机械车间等车间经过群众鸣放辩论，把工作时间进行了调整，由三班改为两班，拿出一个班来专门搞土机床，使生产任务和大搞土机床结合起来。一个规模壮阔的大搞土机床土设备的群众运动，在各车间中迅速展开。
    目前，这个厂大搞土机床土设备的群众运动已进入高潮，卷入运动的不仅有直接参加生产的工人，有工程技术人员和管理干部，同时还有工务勤杂人员。连日来，每天都有几台乃至十余台土机床土设备诞生；每天都有重大的创造发明出现。在已制成的九十二台机床中，不仅有十种简易机床或铁木机床，有土电焊机和土氧气制造机；同时还有中型龙门剪和可以加工直径四公尺的土龙门刨。这些机器的制造，没有向国家要一块料，要一文钱；从设计到制造，完全由工人们自己动手做。有许多土设备，就使用效率来看，却比原来的洋设备要高。如压铆车间制造的土龙门剪机，可以剪裁四糎厚的钢板，而这个车间原有的日本制造的同类龙门剪，却只能剪裁二点五糎厚的钢板。
    这个厂在大搞土机床土设备中，紧紧掌握着缺什么制什么，缺多少制多少的原则进行，首先由主管部门根据各车间的生产任务和设备能力，确定出土机床土设备制造的品种、数量和技术要求，交给各车间；各车间再针对各该车间的生产关键，发动群众鸣放辩论，制订各车间、各生产小组的计划，使车间能统一安排，有计划进行。所以，这个厂的大搞土机床土设备的群众运动，不仅对当前生产没有丝毫影响，而且成为保证当前生产任务的完成并为明年生产做好准备的重要措施。
