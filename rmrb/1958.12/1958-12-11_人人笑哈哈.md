　　The east had just revealed a touch of red when the radio station broadcast melodious music. The day off for the Seventh Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune in Nankai District, Tianjin, had begun.

　　On this day, people all got up so early, cleaning their houses inside and out. Suddenly, whistles sounded one after another on the playground, and the team leader shouted, "Assemble!" The young people quickly gathered. Some groups continued to participate in labor-defense system exercises, starting various training projects, while others practiced basketball, preparing to participate in the holiday competition.

　　Another group of people who gathered were there to decorate the venue, preparing to carry out various recreational activities. Last night, they rehearsed until twelve o'clock in order to have a good day off. Today's activities are truly diverse. Everyone went to the recreation room, riddle room, table tennis room, Happiness Palace, Children's Home, chess room, and some went to participate in the basketball game.

　　The commune members ate "happiness noodles" for breakfast, which was much more lively than usual New Year's celebrations. It was also the anniversary of the down-to-country cadres, and a celebration meeting was held for the model workers, truly a double blessing.

　　The Happiness Palace is a recreation center specially opened for the elderly. In this hall, several sets of Chinese chess and checkers were already set up. The receptionist brewed strong, fragrant tea, and there were also various fruit candies. The elderly people like to play chess the most, the pieces moving on the chessboard...

　　In the "Children's Home," dozens of children were carefully reading comic books of hero stories, completely engrossed. Some people were playing a "fishing" game on dry land. The children were leaning over the table without making a sound, hooking! Hooking! The little fishing rod was raised, and the children shouted happily. Some children were also holding three rings in their hands, in an orderly manner, trying to "ring the war criminals." "Chiang Kai-shek, this bad guy, must be caught!" With a clang, it was ringed, "See where you can run!"

　　The riddle room was even more crowded. This was a brainpower test game, which was very interesting. There was a riddle that described the name of a person in the village, called "Pigsy takes Confucius Rong as his teacher." The people around were pondering, "Who is this?" Old Xu walked over, and everyone said to Old Xu, "You have a quick mind, guess who this is?" "Pigsy is Zhu (猪), takes Confucius Rong as his teacher? Ah, is he learning his modesty? It must be Zhu Xueqian (朱学谦) from the barbershop." Everyone laughed and said, "That's right, you're really good!"

　　The folk art performances in the recreation room were also packed, including drum songs, fast stories, musical performances, and singing. Yang Fatty and Liu Skinny, who are famous in the township, jointly performed a comic dialogue. They were the final act, even those who don't like to laugh would be amused to the point of holding their stomachs. An old lady sitting in the back said, "Look at old Yang, so old, yet so amusing."

    人人笑哈哈
    张进光
    东方刚刚露出了微红，广播室里就放出了幽扬的音乐，天津市南开区红旗人民公社第七大队的公休日开始了。
    这天，人们都起得那么早，屋里屋外打扫得干干净净。刹时，操场上哨子连声响了，领队的在喊：“集合了”！小伙子们都迅速集合齐了，有的组继续参加劳卫制锻炼，开始各项锻炼项目，有的练习篮球，准备参加假日的比赛。
    另一部集合的人，他们是来布置会场的，准备开展各项游艺节目，昨夜他们为过好这个公休日，一直排练到十二点钟。今天的活动真是多种多样，大家分头去游艺室、灯谜室、乒乓球室、幸福宫、少年之家、棋室，还有的去参加篮球比赛。
    社员们早饭吃的是喜面，比往常过年过节可热闹的多，又是下放干部的一周年纪念，开表模庆功大会，真是双喜临门了。
    幸福宫是专为老人开辟的一个游艺馆，在这个馆里，早已摆好了几副象棋和跳棋，招待员沏好了浓香清茶，还有多样的水果糖。老人最喜欢的是下棋，棋子在棋盘上摆动着……。
    “少年之家”里有几十个孩子们在细心地看英雄故事连环画，看的都入了神。还有人在玩钓旱鱼游戏。孩子们扒在桌子上一声不吭，钩呀！钩，小鱼杆扬起来了，孩子们乐滋滋地嚷起来了。还有些孩子们井然有序地每人手里拿着三个圈在“套战犯”，“蒋介石这个坏蛋，非把他逮住不可”，哐啷一下，套着了，“看你哪跑”！
    谜语室的人挤的更多，这是个脑力测验游戏，很有趣。有一个打本村一人名的谜语，叫“八戒拜孔融为师”，围着的人都在琢磨着，
  “这是谁呢”？老徐走了过来，大家都说老徐，“你脑子快，你猜猜这是谁？”“八戒是猪（朱），拜孔融为师？啊，这是学他谦让？准是理发所朱学谦吧”。大伙都哈哈笑了，说：“对，你真行！”
    游艺室演出的曲艺节目也是满座，有大鼓、快书、音乐演奏和唱歌等。本乡驰名的杨胖子和刘瘦子合说了一段相声，他俩是最后压场，那怕你最不爱笑的，也得逗得你捂着肚子出来。后边坐着一位老太太说：“你们看老杨，那么大的年纪，多哏呀”。
