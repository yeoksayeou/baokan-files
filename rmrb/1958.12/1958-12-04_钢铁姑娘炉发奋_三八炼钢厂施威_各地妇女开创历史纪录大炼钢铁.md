    This newspaper reports that in the mass movement for steel production, women have become an important force. They have made outstanding contributions in steelmaking, iron smelting, mining, transportation, and providing services for the lives of steel workers. They have produced iron and steel themselves, broken superstitions, and shattered feelings of inferiority. They believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party, women can do anything.
    According to statistics from some provinces, women laborers account for about 10% of the total labor force on the steel front, and in some cases, it reaches 40%. In Yuxian County, Henan Province, all steel plants have women participating in steelmaking or other auxiliary labor. In Heilongjiang Province, women have built more than 3,500 blast furnaces. According to statistics from 147 of these blast furnaces, they have already produced more than 1,580 tons of iron.
    In Jilin Province, women participating in steel production have built 21,600 various indigenous and modern blast furnaces, such as "Iron and Steel Girls' Furnaces," "March 8th Steel Plants," and "Women Heroes' Furnaces," through their own efforts. In Jilin City Steel Plant, 83 women learned to tap iron and slag, watch wind vents, make sand molds, and perform general furnace repair techniques. They can also accurately grasp the furnace's ingredients and amount of charging, and detect symptoms of possible accidents in the furnace. Since its ignition, the furnace's production has been normal and it was rated as the safest furnace in the entire plant.
    In the Beibei District of Chongqing, 29 women built a "March 8th Furnace." They learned while doing, learned while asking, and mastered a set of iron smelting techniques such as iron tapping and slag removal. In 31 days, they produced more than 60 tons of iron, with the highest daily output reaching more than four tons, breaking the district's highest output record for cold-air, all-coke blast furnaces. The District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party named it the district's Red Flag High-Yield Furnace.
    Women have also made outstanding contributions on the mining, transportation, and coking fronts. In Zongzhuang, Henan Province, more than 4,000 women participated in transportation, carrying more than 220,000 catties of coal. Some women in Yuxian County organized themselves to transport vegetables to the people making steel in the mountains. Women on the steel front in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region used their rest time to wash and mend clothes for their male comrades. (Attached picture)

    钢铁姑娘炉发奋  三八炼钢厂施威
    各地妇女开创历史纪录大炼钢铁
    本报讯  在全民炼钢铁运动中，妇女群众成为一支重要的力量。她们在炼钢、炼铁、开矿、运输以及为钢铁工人生活服务等方面，作出了出色的贡献。她们自己炼出了钢铁，打破了迷信，打破了自卑感，她们相信在共产党的领导下，妇女什么事情都能干。
    根据一部分省的统计，在钢铁战线上妇女劳动力约占劳动力总数的10％，有的达到40％。河南省禹县各个钢铁厂，都有妇女参加炼钢铁或作其他辅助劳动。黑龙江省妇女建立的高炉就有三千五百多座，其中据一百四十七座高炉的统计，已经生产出铁一千五百八十多吨。
    吉林省参加钢铁生产的妇女自己动手修建的“钢铁姑娘炉”、“三八炼钢厂”、“妇女英雄炉”等各种土、洋高炉二万一千六百多座。吉林市钢铁厂八十三名妇女学会了打出铁口、渣口，看风眼，做砂型和一般的修炉技术，还能准确地掌握炉的配料和添料量，觉察出炉子可能发生事故的症状等。这座炉子自点火以来生产一直正常，被评为全厂的第一安全炉。
    重庆市北碚区的二十九名妇女修建了一座“三八炉”，她们边做、边学、边问，学会了出铁、放渣等一套炼铁技术，在三十一天中出铁六十多吨，日产量最高时达到四吨多，突破了全区冷风全焦高炉的最高产量，被中共区委命名为全区红旗高产炉。
    妇女们在开矿、运输、炼焦等战线上，也作出了出色的贡献。河南省宗庄妇女参加运输的四千多人，运煤二十二万多斤。禹县部分妇女组织起来，运送蔬菜给山上炼钢铁的人吃。宁夏回族自治区钢铁战线上的妇女们，利用休息时间为男同志洗补衣袜。（附图片）
