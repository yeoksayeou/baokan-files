    Plasticized Bamboo

    Plasticized bamboo is made by first chemically treating bamboo to remove lignin, then treating it with phenolic resin and hot-pressing it. Shanghai Tongji University, Shanghai Railway Bureau, and Tangshan Coal Research Institute are jointly engaged in this research.

    Plasticized bamboo has high strength, light weight, is not easily corroded, has low cost, and can replace steel and wood.

    Plasticized bamboo shavings are hard plastics made from bamboo waste and can replace steel for doors, windows, and machine parts.

    塑化竹材
    塑化竹材是将竹材先经过化学处理除去木质素后，再用酚醛树脂处理经热压而成。上海同济大学与上海铁路局、唐山煤炭科学研究院共同从事这项研究。
    塑化竹材强度高、重量轻、不易腐烂、成本低、可以代替钢材与木材。
    塑化竹纷系利用竹材废料做成的坚硬的塑料，可以代替钢材作门窗和机器零件等。
