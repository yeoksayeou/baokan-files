    Guangxi's Largest Hydropower Station
    Construction of Guangxi's largest hydropower station – the Zhaoping Hydropower Station with an installed capacity of 450,000 kilowatts – officially commenced on December 1st.
    According to the construction plan, this hydropower station will begin generating electricity in 1960 and will be fully completed in 1961. Once fully completed, it will be able to generate 2.09 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This power station will directly supply industrial and lighting electricity to the main industrial bases in Guangxi, such as Liuzhou and Guilin. After the hydropower station is completed, it can also improve the situation of many shoals and rapid waters in the Guijiang River for more than 300 kilometers, and insufficient water volume during the dry season, so that ships can travel unimpeded. In addition, the 292-square-kilometer reservoir of the hydropower station can irrigate 490,000 mu of farmland.
    The dam site of the Zhaoping Hydropower Station is located in the lower reaches of the Guijiang River, a tributary of the Xijiang River. The dam to be built is a large concrete gravity dam with a height of 103 meters.

    广西最大的水电站
    广西最大的水电站——装机容量四十五万瓩的昭平水电站1日正式开工兴建。
    按照施工计划，这座水电站将在1960年开始发电，1961年全部建成。它全部建成以后每年能发电二零点九亿度。这个电站将直接供应广西主要工业基地柳州、桂林等地工业用电和照明用电。水电站建成以后，还可以改善桂江三百多公里滩多水急、枯水期间水量不足的情况，使船只航行通行无阻。此外，水电站的二百九十二平方公里的大水库，可以灌溉四十九万亩农田。
    昭平水电站的拦河坝坝址位于西江支流——桂江的下游。将建成的拦河坝，是一座混凝土重力式大坝，坝高一百零三公尺。
