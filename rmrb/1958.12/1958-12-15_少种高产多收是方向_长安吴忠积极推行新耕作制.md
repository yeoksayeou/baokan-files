    Less Planting, High Yield, More Harvest is the Direction
    Chang'an and Wuzhong Actively Promote New Cropping Systems
    (Our Report) Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, farmers are actively carrying out farmland capital construction to create conditions for the implementation of the "three-three system" of agricultural production.
    Around the autumn harvest this year, the county's masses, combined with mountain management projects, planted trees on 410,000 mu; they expanded irrigation areas by a total of 418,000 mu by building plateau irrigation canals, small canals, small and medium-sized reservoirs, and water wells. Together with the original water lands, the county's water lands accounted for more than 90% of the total cultivated land, providing water conservancy conditions for the realization of the "three-three system." At present, all people's communes in the county have begun preliminary land use planning, adjusting inter-commune interspersed land, and, combined with soil surveys, have proposed five different crop rotation systems.
    Chang'an County has a total land area of more than 3.64 million mu, of which 2.4 million mu are mountainous and only 1.24 million mu are plains. When the Chang'an County Party Committee proposed the "three-three system" planning proposal, some people thought that after the "three-three system" was implemented, many of the current good lands would have to be fallowed for planting trees, so they resisted the idea ideologically. The Chang'an County Party Committee, in response to these ideological concerns, conducted extensive and in-depth publicity among the masses. In order to promote the benefits of the "less planting, high yield, more harvest" cropping system to the masses, the county party committee mobilized the masses to discuss the cases of high-yield wheat production that occurred throughout the county this year. Through these discussions, farmers realized that as long as they cultivated intensively, they could harvest more grain on the same or even fewer lands, changing farmers' old concepts about land and farming methods.
    In order to create conditions for the implementation of the "three-three system," Chang'an County cultivated more than 176,000 mu of wheat satellite fields this year, accounting for 35.8% of the total wheat area. It is planned that the total output will reach more than 1.29 billion jin next year. At present, farmers across the county are topdressing and watering wheat satellite fields with urine, checking seedlings and protecting seedlings, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests to ensure that wheat seedlings survive the winter safely. In addition, they are also working to solve many new problems brought about by changes in the cropping system: First, although the county has basically achieved water conservancy, the distribution of the original irrigation facilities is very uneven, the water sources for irrigation projects in the plateau areas are insufficient, and the irrigation area is too large, and the original water conservancy is far from meeting future irrigation needs. Based on this situation, the county party committee decided to build 200 water canals and 900 reservoirs in the plateau area this winter and next spring, and to dig machine wells and artesian wells in the plains area. At present, more than 60,000 water conservancy troops in the county have arrived at the construction site one after another. Second, after the implementation of highly dense planting, the fertilizer demand of various crops is constantly increasing. Relying solely on the past general methods of searching for and accumulating fertilizer can not only fail to meet the current needs, but also keep the fertilizer problem in a state of tension and passivity for a long time. To this end, the county decided to break the small circle of searching for and accumulating fertilizer and vigorously carry out basic fertilizer construction. At present, the county has established 3,970 various fertilizer factories, built more than 7,800 various urine production pools, more than 3,500 fumigation rooms, and more than 22,000 composting pits. Third, in order to improve the quality of cultivation, promote the production responsibility system, and change the current phenomenon of neglecting one thing and losing sight of another and rough cultivation in production management, people's communes throughout the county will implement specialized labor organization starting next year. Fourth, in view of the fact that after the implementation of the "three-three system," grain output will increase sharply, which will inevitably bring about the problem of balanced development of the agricultural economy, the county, while increasing the yield per unit area of crops, has now begun to vigorously develop diversified operations. All people's communes are organizing labor to develop sideline occupations such as raising pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, fish, silkworms, and bees. At the same time, they are actively developing mountain resources, first sending out 30 investigators who traveled all over the Zhongnan Mountains, established ten mountain sideline bases, and established mountain material purchasing stations.

    (Our Report) Wuzhong City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, actively adopted various measures in implementing the basic farmland system to provide "high-yield insurance" for next year's basic farmland.
    Wuzhong City's basic farmland for next year is 80,000 mu (30,000 mu for cash crops and 50,000 mu for grain crops), a reduction of 49,000 mu compared with this year's cultivated land area, while the total grain output is to be increased from 56.53 million jin this year to 125 million jin. With the combination of industry and agriculture, nearly 4,000 strong laborers have invested in various industrial constructions, and only 16,000 male and female full and semi-laborers remain on the agricultural front. In order to overcome the long-standing habit of extensive planting and low yield and achieve less planting, high yield, and more harvest, while promoting the benefits of the basic farmland system to the masses, new measures have been proposed in tactics: Oppose the average use of power, and achieve concentrated leadership and concentrated technology. The 50,000 mu of basic farmland (grain crops) are divided into three levels according to the level of yield indicators, and fertilizer, deep plowing, and seed preparation are carried out according to the level, so that the focus of basic farmland is on the key points.
    In order to achieve regularized farmland operation management, first, eliminate "flying land" (interspersed land) between brigades and brigades and teams and teams, and comprehensively carry out land planning. Then, on the basis of comprehensive land planning, vigorously renovate canals. This winter and next spring, 14 sections of straightened canals will be cut, and bridge, culvert, and gate water conservancy buildings will be improved and drainage ditches will be excavated and renovated.
    At present, all brigades are actively accumulating and making fertilizer. In the city alone, more than 600 people have formed two specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, and another 500 people and more than 70 vehicles have traveled hundreds of miles to mountainous areas to burn gypsum on the spot to extract chemical fertilizer raw materials. The city's comprehensive fertilizer factory has also been decentralized to the commune. More than 20,000 mu of land have been fertilized in layers, and 50,000 mu of basic farmland (grain crops) have been deeply plowed according to the required size.

    少种高产多收是方向
    长安吴忠积极推行新耕作制
    本报讯  陕西省长安县农民积极进行农田基本建设，为实行农业生产“三三制”创造条件。
    今年秋收前后，全县群众结合治山工程种树造林四十一万多亩；修高原灌溉渠道、小型渠道，中小型水库、水井等共扩大灌溉面积四十一万八千多亩，加上原有的水地全县水地占到耕地总面积的90％以上，为实现“三三制”提供了水利条件。现在，全县各人民公社已开始进行初步的土地利用规划，调整社与社之间插花地，并结合土壤调查，提出五种不同的轮作制度。
    长安县全县土地面积共有三百六十四万多亩，其中山地二百四十万亩，川原地只有一百二十四万亩。当中共长安县委提出“三三制”规划意见的时候，有些群众以为实行“三三制”后，就要把现在的许多好地都要休耕种树，因而思想上抵触很大。中共长安县委针对这些思想顾虑，向群众进行了广泛深入的宣传。为了向群众宣传“少种、高产、多收”耕作制度的好处，县委发动群众讨论了今年全县出现的小麦高额丰产事例。通过这些讨论，使农民认识到只要精耕细作，就可能在同样甚至少数的土地上收获更多的粮食，改变了农民对土地以及耕作方法上的旧观念。
    为了给实行“三三制”创造条件，今年长安县共培养小麦卫星田十七万六千多亩，占小麦总面积的35.8％。计划明年总产量达到十二亿九千万多斤。目前，全县农民正在给小麦卫星田追肥、浇尿、查苗护苗、防治病虫害，保证麦苗安全过冬。此外，并着手解决由于耕作制度的改变带来的许多新问题：第一、现在全县虽已基本实现了水利化，但原来的灌溉设施分布很不平衡，高原地区的灌溉工程水源不足，灌溉面积过大，原有的水利远远不能满足今后的灌溉需要。根据这种情况，县委决定今冬明春在高原地区兴修水渠二百条，水库九百个，在平川地区打机井、自流井等。目前，全县六万多名水利大军已先后到达工地。第二、实行高度密植后，各种农作物的需肥量不断增加，单靠过去一般的搜肥积肥方法，不仅不能适应当前的需求，而且使肥料问题长期处于紧张、被动状态。为此，该县决定打破搜肥积肥的小圈子，大搞肥料基本建设。现在，全县共办起各种肥料厂三千九百七十个，修建各种造尿池七千八百多个，熏肥室三千五百多个，沤肥坑二万二千多个。第三、为了提高耕作质量、推行生产责任制，改变当前生产管理中的顾此失彼、耕作粗糙现象，全县各人民公社从明年起实行劳动组织专业化。第四、鉴于实行“三三制”后，粮食产量激增，必然给农业经济带来平衡发展的问题，因此，该县在提高农作物单位面积产量的同时，现已着手大力发展多种经营。各人民公社都在组织劳力，开展养猪、羊、鸡、鸭、兔、鱼、蚕、蜂等副业。同时，并积极开发山区资源，先派出三十个调查员，跑遍终南山，建立了十处山区副业基地，成立山区物资采购站。

    本报讯  宁夏回族自治区吴忠市，在贯彻执行基本农田制中，积极采取各种措施，为明年基本农田作“丰产保险”。
    吴忠市明年基本农田八万亩（经济作物三万亩，粮食作物五万亩），比今年耕地面积缩减了四万九千亩，而粮食总产量要在今年五千六百五十三万斤的基础上提高到一亿二千五百万斤。在工农业并举的情况下，近四千名强劳力，投入了各项工业建设，留在农业战线上的男女全半劳力，只有一万六千人。为了克服长久以来广种薄收的习惯，做到少种高产多收，在向群众宣传基本农田制好处的同时，在战术上提出了新的措施：反对平均使用力量，做到领导集中、技术集中。把五万亩基本农田（粮食作物）根据产量指标高低，分为三级，按级施肥、深耕、备种，使基本农田中重点套重点。
    为做到正规化的农田操作管理，首先在大队与大队、中队与中队之间，消灭“飞地”（插花地），全面进行土地规划而后在全面规划土地的基础上，大力整修渠道。今冬明春，将裁弯取直渠道十四段并改进桥梁、涵洞、斗门等水利建筑物和开挖整修排水沟。
    目前，各大队正积极积肥造肥。仅市内，就有六百多人组成了两个专业积肥队，另外有五百多人、七十多辆车，远征百里以外的山区就地烧石膏提炼化肥原料。市上的综合肥料厂，也已下放到公社。二万多亩地都已分层施了肥，五万亩基本农田（粮食作物）已按要求的尺寸深翻完毕。
