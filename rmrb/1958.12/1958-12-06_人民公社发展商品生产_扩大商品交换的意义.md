    The Significance of People's Communes Developing Commodity Production and Expanding Commodity Exchange
    The sixth issue of the "East Wind" bi-monthly published an article by Comrade Xie Xuegong, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, titled "Strengthening Rural Financial and Trade Work to Promote the Development of the People's Commune Economy." This article analyzes the significant changes that have taken place in rural production, distribution, exchange, and consumption after the people's communes were established. It discusses important issues such as how to adapt to the new situation, improve the rural financial and trade management system, develop commodity production, improve the financial system, and strengthen the Party committee's leadership over financial and trade work. The second part of the article discusses the importance and principles of extensively developing commodity production and expanding commodity exchange. The article states that people's communes should not only develop self-sufficient production but also develop commodity production. At the present stage, it is necessary to develop commodity production and expand commodity exchange because, under the conditions of the coexistence of two forms of ownership, commodity exchange between the state and the commune, and between communes, is easily accepted by the masses. Furthermore, commodity exchange promotes the development of production, increases social products, improves the lives of commune members, and creates material conditions for the transition to ownership by the whole people. Developing commodity production and expanding commodity exchange can increase the accumulation of the commune, ensure the continuous expansion of reproduction and improve the lives of commune members; it can promote the exchange of materials between regions, mutual support, and exchange of needed goods; it can promote the economic accounting of various economic organizations of the commune, save expenses, reduce costs, improve product quality, and improve business management. The article briefly explains, from a theoretical and practical perspective, that under the socialist system, due to the public ownership of the means of production and the leadership of the Party and the proletarian state power, the development of commodity production will not only not generate capitalism but will also serve socialist construction. It points out that the concern that developing commodity production will lead to capitalism is unnecessary. At the same time, it also points out that in our country, what guides economic development is putting politics in command and state planning, and as long as commodity production is developed in a planned way, blindness can be completely avoided. The article also explains the principles for developing commodity production. It emphasizes that people's communes must implement the policy of running communes diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally. They must manage financial work well, learn to be meticulous in calculation, overcome certain chaotic phenomena, and resolutely fight against extravagance and waste, embezzlement, and theft.

    人民公社发展商品生产  扩大商品交换的意义
    “东风”半月刊第六期发表了河北省委书记处书记解学恭同志的一篇文章，题为“加强农村财贸工作，促进人民公社经济的发展”。这篇文章分析了在人民公社化后农村的生产、分配、交换、消费方面所起的重大变化，对于如何适应新情况，改进农村财贸管理体制、发展商品生产、健全财务制度、加强党委对财贸工作的领导等重要问题作了论述。文章的第二部分论述了广泛地发展商品生产、扩大商品交换的重要意义和方针。文章说，人民公社不仅应发展自给性的生产，而且还必须发展商品性的生产。在现阶段必须发展商品生产和扩大商品交换，这是因为在两种所有制并存的条件下，国家与公社、公社与公社之间保持商品交换易为群众所接受，并且通过商品交换来促进生产的发展，增加社会产品，提高社员生活，为过渡到全民所有制创造物质条件。发展商品生产和扩大商品交换，可以增加公社的积累，保证不断地扩大再生产和提高社员生活；可以沟通各地区物资交流，互相支援，互通有无；可以促进公社各种经济组织的经济核算，节约开支，降低成本，提高产品质量，改善经营管理。文章扼要地从理论上和实践上说明在社会主义制度下，由于生产资料的公有制和有党与无产阶级国家政权的领导，发展商品生产不仅不会产生资本主义，而且能为社会主义建设服务。指出那种怕发展商品生产会产生资本主义的顾虑是不必要的。同时又指出在我国指导经济发展的是政治挂帅和国家计划，只要有计划地发展商品生产，盲目性是完全可以避免的。文章对于发展商品生产的方针也作了说明。强调人民公社必须贯彻勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，必须管好财务工作，学会精打细算，克服某些混乱现象，坚决向铺张浪费、贪污盗窃行为作斗争。
