Relying on the Masses to Properly Arrange Winter Life
	Chen County Special District Self-Reliantly Solves Problems of Clothing, Food, Housing, Heating, etc.

(Our dispatch) The Party committees at all levels in Chen County Special District, Hunan Province, have adopted proactive measures to ensure that the masses have a good first winter after the establishment of the people's communes.

The biggest characteristic of this special district's arrangements for the masses to spend the winter is comprehensiveness. Many communes have made comprehensive arrangements for everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation to heating and prevention of frostbite. In terms of food, communes first adjusted the dining halls. Some dining halls in Zixing County were too large, and some households had to travel three or four li to eat. After the adjustment, the dining halls in the county generally serve around seventy or eighty households, making it very convenient to eat. Secondly, they expanded the planting of winter vegetables, dried large quantities of pickled vegetables, and stored them for the winter. In Chen County, more than 260,000 people planted more than 30,000 mu of vegetables. In order to store pickled vegetables well for the winter, the Qifengdu Commune Party Committee even held a special symposium to research more than one hundred ways to make pickles. In addition, in order to ensure that commune members could eat hot meals, hot food, and drink hot water, and use hot water, most dining halls in various places took concrete measures. In the past, the Shijia Dining Hall in Qifengdu, Chen County, used to serve the dishes one bowl at a time before meals, which quickly cooled down. Now, the dishes are served in a large bowl and scooped out when it is time to eat. Previously, this dining hall had only one pot for boiling water. After the water was boiled, it was poured into a tank outside, which cooled down easily and could not meet the demand. Now, a hot water pool has been built so that hot water is always available. Hot water is supplied three times a day, in the morning, noon, and evening. The care for children in kindergartens and the elderly in homes for the elderly is even better. At mealtimes in the Gangjiao Brigade Kindergarten, there is a stove of white charcoal fire on each table. In the Maotouling Brigade Kindergarten, each table has a coal stove underneath, which provides both heating and keeps the food warm. About 90% of the dining halls in the entire district can ensure that commune members eat hot food, drink hot water, and use hot water.

In terms of clothing: All communes conducted a thorough survey of households lacking cotton-padded clothes and quilts, and then, based on the different economic situations of each household, withdrew a portion of funds from cash income and public welfare funds to purchase cotton-padded clothes and quilts for them through loans and relief. Approximately 13% of the households in the district (accounting for 10% of the population) lacked cotton-padded clothes, quilts, and winter shoes and socks, totaling more than 300,000 cotton-padded clothes, 110,000 quilts, and more than 730,000 pairs of cotton shoes. As of the 14th, according to incomplete statistics, nearly 100,000 cotton-padded clothes, 30,000 quilts, and more than 380,000 pairs of cotton shoes had been provided. In order to produce cotton-padded clothes and quilts in a timely manner, many places concentrated sewing and cotton-fluffing workers. Those that were not concentrated were required to prioritize the sewing of cotton-padded clothes and quilts. The problem of shoes and socks was generally solved in two ways: one was to establish professional teams, and the other was to arrange a certain amount of time for women to make shoes and socks.

In terms of housing: Most communes conducted an inspection of the houses in which commune members lived, making adjustments and repairs as needed. Taking Yongxing County as an example, a total of 7,282 houses were repaired.

In terms of heating: All counties and communes have taken some measures based on past habits and local conditions: those with coal burn coal, and those without coal burn charcoal. Generally, commune members are supplied with a fixed amount, and homes for the elderly and kindergartens are given appropriate care. Heating is generally done on a household basis. In order to ensure the supply of coal and charcoal, many communes have transferred some labor to form specialized charcoal-burning and coal-mining teams. Communes that have not established specialized teams have adopted the method of arranging a certain amount of time for commune members to mine coal and collect firewood. Currently, 77% of the communes in the district have solved the heating problem.

In addition, many communes have also transferred people with specialized skills to rush to make bamboo hats and raincoats to solve the problem of rain gear for commune members to spend the winter.

The meticulous and comprehensive arrangements made by Chen County Special District for the winter life of the broad masses are a very complex matter. This not only encounters many difficulties, but also generates various ideological struggles. How can we do a good job in such an extremely important and complex task? The experience of Chen County Special District is: First, implement the mass line in solving problems of all sizes. First of all, launch a mass discussion on the issue of spending the winter, put forward the problems and difficulties in spending the winter, and mobilize the masses to come up with ideas and solutions. Wherever this has been done, difficulties have been easily solved, and the masses are happily spending the winter. The Mata Commune in Yongxing County originally felt that heating was a major problem this year. There were no heating utensils, and there was no labor to make them, and there were no materials. Later, the masses were mobilized to discuss it. Everyone proposed building stoves with yellow mud in natural villages and using their own hands during the evening hours. As a result, the heating problem was solved without spending a penny. In order to solve the problem of lack of clothing and bedding for poor households, the Bolin Commune in Yongxing decided to develop sideline production and seize cash income. However, some wealthy households held an indifferent attitude. They said: It is the same to engage in cash income as it is not to engage in cash income. Anyway, we have no share. In response to this idea, the commune organized a large discussion. Through the discussion, everyone raised their awareness and took active action. In just three days, they seized more than 24,000 yuan in cash, with an average income of 1.5 yuan per person. Second, adhere to the principles of diligence, thrift, and self-reliance. Although this year's industrial and agricultural production has made great leaps forward, we must strive for even greater leaps forward next year, which requires a lot of funds. Therefore, when solving the problem of spending the winter, we must proceed from the current actual situation, not seek newness and completeness, and should be simple and crude. In this regard, most areas have done well. For example, the No. 3 Company of Jingpo Commune in Rucheng County had a dining hall that was unsuitable, crowded, and the commune members had no bathhouse to take a bath. In order to spend the winter well, they decided to renovate a dilapidated house. After some repairs, they not only built a spacious and bright dining hall, but also set up a bathhouse, an elderly restaurant, and a patient restaurant. The entire project took only fifty workdays and did not cost a penny. Self-reliance and vigorously seizing cash income are the fundamental ways to solve the problem of purchasing cotton-padded clothes and quilts and lacking pocket money. As a result of vigorously seizing cash income in Ling County, the average income per person was more than twelve yuan. The Huohua Commune in the county was originally three-without: no money to use, no money to smoke, and no money to add clothes. Due to the development of sideline production, the income of more than 150,000 yuan in cash in one month changed the situation of "three-without." (Attached picture)

    依靠群众妥贴安排冬季生活
    郴县专区自力更生全面解决衣食住烤火等问题
    本报讯  湖南省郴县专区各级党委采取积极措施，让群众过好公社化以后的第一个冬天。
    这个专区安排群众过冬最大的特点是全面，许多公社从衣、食、住、行，到烤火取暖和防治冻疮疾病，都作了全面安排。在食的方面各地公社首先调整了食堂。资兴县原先有些食堂过大，有的户吃饭要跑三、四里路，经过调整后，全县的食堂一般都在七、八十户左右，吃起饭来很方便。其次，扩种过冬蔬菜，大晒坛子菜，储备过冬。郴县全县二十六万多人，共种蔬菜三万多亩。该县栖凤渡公社党委为了储好坛子菜过冬，还专门开了个座谈会，研究出一百多种作腌菜的办法。另外，为了让社员吃到热菜热饭热开水，用到热水，各地绝大部分食堂都采取了具体措施：郴县栖凤渡石家食堂原先在开饭前就把菜一碗碗盛出来，很快就凉了；现在把菜盛在一个大钵里，到开饭时再舀。这个食堂原先只有一个锅烧水，水烧热后舀到外面缸里，容易凉，也供不应求；现在作了个热水池，随时都有热水用。开水每天分早、中、晚供应三次。对幼儿园的小孩和敬老院的老人照顾更好。冈脚中队幼儿园开饭时，每个桌上一炉白炭火；马头岭中队茅卜幼儿园每个桌下装了个煤炉，又烤火又热菜。在全区的食堂当中，像这样能保证社员吃到热饭菜，喝到热开水和用到热水的食堂，大约占到90％以上。
    在穿的方面：各公社都对缺棉衣棉被的户，普遍摸了一次底，然后根据各户不同的经济情况，从现金收入和公益金中抽出一部分资金来，用借支和救济的办法，给他们置办棉衣棉被。全区约有13％的户（占10％的人口）缺棉衣、棉被和过冬鞋袜，计缺棉衣三十多万件，棉被十一万床，棉鞋七十三万多双；到14日为止，据不完全统计，已解决棉衣近十万件，棉被三万床，棉鞋三十八万多双。为了及时赶制出棉衣棉被，很多地方把缝纫和弹花工人集中起来，没有集中的都规定优先缝制棉衣棉被。解决鞋袜问题一般采取了两种办法：一种是成立专业小组，也有的是给妇女安排一定的时间作鞋袜。
    住的方面：大多数公社对社员住的房屋进行了一次检查，该调整的调整，该整修的整修。以永兴县为例，共整修了房屋七千二百八十二间。
    烤火方面：各县、社都根据过去的习惯，因地制宜地采取了一些措施：有煤的烧煤，没有煤的烧木炭；一般对社员实行定量供应，对敬老院和幼儿园则适当照顾。取暖一般以户为单位。为了保证煤和木炭的供给，很多公社都抽调了一些劳力组成烧炭、挖煤专业组。没有成立专业组的公社，采取的办法是给社员安排一定的时间挖煤打柴，现在全区已有77％的公社解决了烤火问题。
    此外，很多公社还抽调了有专门技术的人赶制斗笠、蓑衣，替社员解决过冬的雨具问题。
    郴县专区这样细致地全面安排广大群众的冬季生活，是一桩非常复杂的事情，这中间不仅会遇到许许多多的困难，而且会产生各色各样的思想斗争。如何才能办好这样一件意义极其重大而又如此复杂的工作呢？郴县专区的经验是：第一，在解决大大小小的问题上都贯彻群众路线。首先就过冬问题展开全民性的大讨论，把过冬中的问题和困难摆出来，发动群众出主意，想办法。凡是这样作了的地方，困难迎刃而解，群众愉快地过着冬天。永兴县马田公社原来感到今年烤火是个大问题，没有烤火用具，作吗，劳力又顾不过来，并且没有材料。后来发动群众讨论，大家提出以自然村为单位，用黄泥巴筑火炉，并且利用晚上时间自己动手作，结果不花一文钱就解决了烤火问题。永兴柏林公社为了解决困难户缺衣少被的问题，决定开展副业生产，大抓现金收入。但是有些富裕户却抱着无所谓的态度，他们说：搞现金也是一样，不搞现金也是一样，反正没有我们份。针对这种思想，公社组织了一次大讨论，通过讨论，大家提高了认识，都积极行动了起来，仅仅三天时间，就抓进现金二万四千多元，每人平均收入一元五。第二、坚持勤俭和自力更生的原则。今年的工农业生产虽然大跃进了，但明年还要争取更大的跃进，需要大量的资金，因此，在解决过冬问题时，必须从当前的实际情况出发，不要求新求全，应当因陋就简。在这方面，绝大部分地区都作得较好。比如汝城县井坡公社三连，食堂不适用，拥挤不堪，社员们没有澡堂洗澡。为了过好冬天，他们决定把一栋破烂的房子进行改造，经过一番整修，不仅建设了一间既宽敞又明亮的大餐厅，并且还设了洗澡场、老人餐厅和病人餐厅。全部工程只用了五十个工，没有花一文钱。自力更生、大抓现金收入，这是解决置办棉衣棉被和缺零用钱的根本办法。酃县大抓现金收入的结果，每人平均收入十二元多。该县火花公社原先是三无：无钱用、无钱吸烟、无钱添衣。由于开展了副业生产，一月收入现金十五万多元，一下改变了“三无”的情况。（附图片）
