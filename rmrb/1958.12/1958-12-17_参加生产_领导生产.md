    Participate in Production, Lead Production

    Cadres at all levels of the Sihai People's Commune in Yanqing County, Beijing, personally participate in production and lead production as ordinary laborers.

    The commune was first led by the Party Committee Secretary and several Deputy Secretaries, who took the lead in winter sideline production, leading commune members to climb mountains to cut grass, trim branches, and repair roads. This not only motivated the commune members but also influenced other cadres. The cadres of the Sihai Brigade originally adopted the method of supervising production from outside the production process, cutting only a little over 63,000 catties of branches in six days. Later, when the cadres went up the mountain to cut branches together with the commune members, it greatly boosted the morale of the commune members, and they cut 231,000 catties in one day.

    Cadre participation in production not only sets an example with a spirit of practical hard work and establishes a banner; more importantly, it strengthens ties with commune members, enabling them to discover problems in a timely manner and promote work. The commune members dared to tell the cadres what was on their minds, and problems that could not be understood in the past are now understood. In the sideline production activities, the commune members reported more than 200 opinions to the commune cadres, and they themselves discovered some problems in actual labor that could not be discovered in the office. Comrade Feng Shutian, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, participated in labor in the Shuiquanzi Brigade and found that there was a phenomenon of wasted work in cutting branches. He immediately convened a meeting and reorganized the labor force. Deputy Secretary Sun Zhongke ate with the commune members in the cafeteria and found that the sweet potatoes in the cafeteria were rotten and the commune members were not getting enough to eat. He immediately transferred good sweet potatoes from another team, which the commune members were extremely satisfied with. (Yang Aiquan, Xu Xuefu)

    参加生产  领导生产
    北京市延庆县四海人民公社各级干部，以普通劳动者的姿态，亲自参加生产领导生产。
    这个社首先由党委书记和几位副书记带头，在冬季副业生产当中，分别带领社员一同上山打草、割条、修路。这样做不仅带动了社员，也影响了别的干部。四海大队的干部原来仍采取在生产之外督战的方法，六天才割条子六万三千多斤，后来干部上山和社员一起割，大大鼓舞了社员的情绪，一天就割了二十三万一千斤。
    干部参加生产，不但以实干苦干的精神树立旗帜、起了模范作用；更重要的收获是密切了和社员的联系，能及时发现问题，推动工作。社员们的心里话敢向干部说了，以往了解不到的问题现在了解到了。在副业生产活动中，社员们向公社干部反映了二百多条意见，他们自己在实际劳动中也发现了一些在办公室不能发现的问题。公社党委第一书记封书田同志，在水泉子大队参加劳动，发现割条子有窝工现象立即召开会议从新安排了劳动力。副书记孙中科在食堂和社员们一起吃饭，发现这个食堂的白薯坏了，社员吃不饱，立即从外队调来了好白薯，社员们极为满意。（杨艾泉、徐学富）
