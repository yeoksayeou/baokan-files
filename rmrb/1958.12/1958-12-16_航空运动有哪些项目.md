Aeronautical sports are an important part of national defense sports activities, including activities such as aeronautical models, parachuting, gliding, airplane flying, and aeronautical engineering.

	Aeronautical Models: There are types such as rubber band catapult, line traction, free flight, and radio control.
	Aeronautical Parachuting: There are four items: small parachute tower jumping, large parachute tower jumping, hydrogen balloon jumping, and airplane jumping.
	Gliding: There are four types of gliding: hillside catapult, flat ground catapult, water gliding, and land-based various traction take-off gliding. Gliders also have primary, intermediate, advanced gliders, and record machines.
	Airplane Flying: This activity mainly uses airplanes for various flight training. Currently, Chinese aeronautical athletes use aircraft such as the Yak-18 for flight training.
	Aeronautical Engineering: Mainly includes instrument, radio airplane, glider, winch car, rope winding machine, and other various aircraft maintenance personnel training and glider manufacturing. The purpose of this activity is to cooperate with training tasks, cultivate ground crew to ensure, maintain, use, repair, and manufacture all aeronautical equipment and airplanes, so that people love aeronautical engineering and directly serve gliding flight.

    航空运动有哪些项目
    航空运动是国防体育活动的重要项目之一，它包括航空模型、跳伞、滑翔、飞机飞行和航空工程等活动项目。
    航空模型：有橡筋弹射、线牵引、自由飞、无线电操纵等种类。
    航空跳伞：有小伞塔跳伞、大伞塔跳伞、氢气球跳伞和飞机跳伞等四个项目。
    滑翔运动：滑翔有山坡弹射、平地弹射、水上滑翔、陆地各种牵引起飞滑翔等四种。滑翔机也有初级、中级、高级滑翔机和纪录机等多种。
    飞机飞行运动：这项活动主要是用飞机进行各种飞行训练：目前我国航空运动员用作飞行训练的有雅克十八等式飞机。
    航空工程：主要包括仪表、无线电飞机、滑翔机、绞盘车、收索机等各种机务人员训练和滑翔机制造。这项活动的目的是为了配合训练任务、培养地勤人员以保证、维护、使用、修理和制造一切航空器材和飞机，使人们热爱航空工程和直接为滑翔飞行服务。（附图片）
