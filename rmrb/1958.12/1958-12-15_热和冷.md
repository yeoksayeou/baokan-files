Coming out of the office at night, I immediately felt the chill. Public transportation had stopped running, but the organization provided small cars to specifically take those who lived far away home after the night shift. This couldn't help but make one feel especially warm. Unexpectedly, the car even had heating. Getting inside, my body, which had shrunk from the cold, immediately relaxed, and I felt a melting comfort all over. So, I started chatting with the driver:

	“It seems like there’s heating in the car?”
	“Yes, the heating starts working as soon as the car starts.”
I thought, yes, gasoline has to burn, the engine has to run, so naturally there will be heat. But then I thought, in the hot summer, this heating will probably be unbearable.

	“In the summer, it must be terribly hot in the car, right?”
	“No, in the summer, the car has air conditioning. As soon as the car starts, it can blow cold air.”
Although I still didn't understand how the car could blow cold air as soon as it started, the fact that this car not only provided transportation but could also supply warmth and cold, adapting to any climate change to keep it pleasantly cool or warm, wasn't this truly "wonderful"!

From the car's heating and cooling, I moved on to thinking about people's lives, no, perhaps the movement of all things, which always needs both cold and heat.

We have a saying in the countryside, "knowing cold and feeling warmth." This describes a person caring for another person to the most meticulous degree. If you only take care of food and drink, that's not considered too caring. You also have to pay attention to changes in the weather, the warmth and cold of daily life, and adding or removing clothing. Only then can it be considered "knowing cold and feeling warmth," reaching the highest level of care. It is clear how important the words cold and heat are to people's lives.

Needless to say, the growth of plants needs to adapt to changes in cold and heat. Even the movement of machines, it is said, cannot be separated from heat and cold. It needs heat to start, and at the same time, it needs cooling to reduce heat. Without heat (such as burning coal, gasoline, or electricity), there is no power, and the machine naturally cannot start. But if there is no water or wind to reduce the heat, the parts will burn out due to excessive heat, the cylinder will explode, and the machine will also be unable to start again. Heat and cold are both necessary for machines, and each has its own wonderful use.

However, all these wonderful uses depend on people. Only when people understand and grasp the characteristics of weather changes can they prepare clothing to adapt to the cold and heat. Only when they understand and grasp the characteristics of mechanical movement can they add cooling and heating to maintain its normal operation. If people only care about heat and not cold, only care about cold and not heat; or can only handle heat but not cold, can only handle cold but not heat, then problems are bound to arise. Whenever the seasons change, there are many people with colds, which proves that there are still people who are not good at handling the issue of cold and heat.

So, I thought that people's minds should also be equipped with both cold and heat. People's thinking, work, or guidance of movements should also be a combination of cold and heat. In dealing with things, our minds must be both hot and cold. Soaring enthusiasm is hot, and scientific analysis is cold. Only with a combination of cold and heat can we do things well. Some people are too hot. They only have enthusiasm but are unwilling to calmly analyze things. Over time, they may stumble. We really hope that such people will cool down a bit and pay attention to clearing their minds. But there are also other people who love cold and not heat. They often cannot stand or keep up with things that are moving forward, and they stand aside to criticize, complain, and blame others. The "spectator faction" and the "calculating faction" are this type of person. We must also find ways to gradually warm up these people.

Therefore, neither cold nor heat is absolute. The cold and heat in people's minds are also not absolute. If people do not pay attention to the cold and heat of the weather, they are prone to catching colds. If machines have an imbalance of cold and heat, they will malfunction. Then, if our minds are too cold or too hot, will we not also make rightist or "leftist" mistakes in our work?

Our minds should be equipped with both cold and heat, and we should apply both cold and heat in our work. Being equipped with both cold and heat means having both full enthusiasm, the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, and having a calm mind, the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Applying both cold and heat is not being neither cold nor hot, half-dead, nor is it being hot and cold like having malaria. It is both using soaring enthusiasm to engage in work and having careful planning and following the laws. In short, this is to be a calm promoter and an enthusiastic observer.

    热和冷
    庄农
    夜间从办公室走出来，立即感到寒气袭人。公共车辆已经停驶，机关备有小轿车，专门送路远的夜班人员回家，这不能不使人感到分外温暖。不料小汽车里还有暖汽。一钻进去，冷缩的身子顿然舒展开来，全身感到一似融解般的舒适。我便同司机攀谈起来：
    “车里好像有暖汽？”
    “有的，车一开动就发送出暖汽来。”
    我想，是啊，汽油要燃烧，马达要开动，自然要发生暖汽的。不过我又想，到了炎热的夏天，这暖汽大概要使人吃不消了。
    “夏天大概车里热得够呛吧？”
    “不，夏天车里有冷气，车一开动，就能把冷风送进来。”
    我虽然还不懂，车一开动怎样就能把冷风送进来，但这车不仅供人代步，还能输暖送冷，一任气候变化，总要使它冷暖宜人，这岂不真是“妙矣哉”了么！
    由汽车的冷暖一转而又想到人的生活中，不，也许是一切事物的运动中，总是冷和热都需要的。
    我们乡下有句话叫“知冷疼热”。这是形容一个人对另一个人关心到了无微不至的程度。倘只关照到了饮食，还不算是太关心，要一并注意到气候的变化，起居的寒暖，衣着的添减，这才能算是“知冷疼热”，达到最关心的地步了。可见冷热二字对于人的生活的重要。
    植物的生长，需要适应寒暑的变化，不用说了；就是机器的运动，据说也是离不开热和冷的。它需要热力来开动，同时又需要冷却来减热。没有热（比如燃煤、汽油或电），也就没有力，机器自然发动不起来；但是倘没有水或风来减热，机件便会因热度过高而烧损，汽缸会爆炸，机器同样也无法再发动。热和冷，对机器来说，是必须兼备而又各有各的妙用的。
    然而，这种种妙用却又在于人。人识破和掌握了天气变化的特性，才能备衣物以适应寒暑；识破和掌握了机械运动的特性，才能加冷热以保持它的正常运行。人倘只顾热不顾冷、只顾冷不顾热；或者只能热不能冷，只能冷不能热，就一定要出毛病。每当季节转换之际，多有感冒病人，就证明还有人不善于处理冷热的问题。
    于是我想到了人的头脑也应该冷热俱备。人的从事思想、工作或指导运动，也应该冷热相济。对待事物，我们的头脑又要热又要冷。冲天的干劲是热，科学的分析是冷。只有冷热相济，才能把事办好。有些人太热，只要干劲，却不愿冷静分析，久而久之，可能会栽跟斗，我们真希望这样的人稍稍冷一冷，注意清醒一下自己的头脑。可是也有另一些人却是爱冷不爱热的，对前进的东西，他们常常看不惯，跟不上，还要站在一旁指手划脚，怨天尤人，观潮派算账派就是这种人，我们也要想法使这种人慢慢地热起来。
    所以，冷和热都不是绝对的。人的头脑里的冷和热也不是绝对的。人倘不注意气候的冷热，便容易感冒；机器倘冷热失调便要出故障；那末，我们的头脑，倘失于过冷过热，工作中岂不也会发生右或者“左”的偏向吗？
    我们的头脑要冷热兼备，作事要冷热兼施。冷热兼备就是既要有饱满的热情，敢想敢说敢干的精神，又要具备冷静的头脑，实事求是的精神。冷热兼施并不是不冷不热半死半活，也不是忽冷忽热像发疟疾；而是既要用冲天的干劲去从事工作，又要有周密地打算、适从规律。概言之，这就是要作冷静的促进派，热情的观察家。
