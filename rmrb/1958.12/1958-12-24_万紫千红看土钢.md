Looking at Indigenous Steel Production in a Riot of Color
Introducing the Exhibition Hall of the National Steel "Small Indigenous Alliance" Macheng On-Site Meeting
By our reporter Yuan Zhepિંગ

What can indigenous steel and iron be used for? Many people are still skeptical. Some even denigrate indigenous steel as "tofu dregs steel," saying it crumbles as soon as it's rolled. Is indigenous steel and iron useful? The exhibition hall of the National Steel Small Indigenous Alliance Macheng On-Site Meeting definitively answers this question.

Here are displayed nearly four hundred exhibits from Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, Shanxi, Qinghai, Guangxi, Beijing, and other places, all made of indigenous steel and iron, ranging from castings weighing thousands of tons to forgings as thin as a few millimeters, with casting, drawing, and forging all represented.

              Becoming Materials
The first question answered by the exhibition hall is: indigenous steel can become materials. On display here are various types of steel materials such as square steel, round steel, flat steel, strip steel, and thin plates, which were successfully rolled by small-scale, integrated indigenous and foreign steel enterprises using stir-fried steel billets that are three inches long and one inch thick. They also used these steel materials to process various metal products, such as steel wire, steel wire rope, bearings, saw blades, and crimping knives. If every commune in the country had such integrated enterprises, then the vast majority of the steel materials needed by 500 million farmers could be obtained and manufactured locally. What is the quality of the steel materials rolled from indigenous steel? Let the facts speak for themselves here. For example, the steel wire produced by the Fenghuangwo Iron and Steel Plant is less than one millimeter in diameter; and the drawn wire can be used to make iron nails; the steel wire can be twisted into steel wire rope, etc. All of this shows that as long as indigenous steel is well forged and the impurities in the steel are effectively removed, the quality can rival that of foreign steel. Among the exhibits is a two-and-a-half-foot-long round steel bar, dazzlingly bright, which was made by workers at the Daye Steel Plant using indigenous steel. They proudly praised its quality as surpassing Sun Wukong's golden cudgel, and the bar is inscribed with the following poem: "Indigenous steel takes shape not by magic, surpassing the needle that calmed the seas in days of yore, scaring the Dragon King in the ocean, and making Old Sun angry when held in hand."

            Becoming Machines
The second question answered by the exhibition hall is that indigenous steel and iron can not only become materials, but can also be used to manufacture machines and agricultural machinery, promoting agricultural mechanization. On display here are various indigenous machine tools such as lathes, planers, milling machines, and drilling machines, as well as various agricultural machines such as cotton gins, threshers, peanut shellers, and liberation-style waterwheels, which are urgently needed by the people's communes to arm their own machinery factories and improve agricultural production and process agricultural products. Macheng County ordered more than 100 machine tools from Shanghai, Wuhan, Jinan, and other places this year, but not a single one has been received. When tractors and power equipment malfunction, they have to be taken to Hankou, more than 130 kilometers away, and there's still a long wait. Now that lathes, planers, and milling machines have been made with indigenous steel and iron, it is possible to arm ourselves. The first machinery factory in Macheng County produces rice threshers with indigenous steel that can be operated by three people and thresh 10,000 jin per day, equivalent to the work of thirty laborers. Not only are these exhibits themselves made entirely of indigenous steel and iron, but some of the processing tools are also made of indigenous steel. The exhibition hall has a four-and-a-half-foot belt-driven lathe, whose bed surface, spindle, and carriage have the same wear resistance as lathes made of foreign steel, but the cost is more than half lower. This is a product of the Youxian Agricultural Machinery Factory in Hunan. When the workers at this factory produced this lathe, they only had a few pairs of pliers and files, and they couldn't buy thread-cutting dies made of foreign steel anywhere. In the end, there was no other way, so master craftsman Ou Qingjie and fitter Yang Zhenhua made them themselves with indigenous steel. They put the tools made of indigenous steel into water mixed with seven simple materials such as hair, cattle bone ash, and wood ash for indigenous heat treatment, and the resulting thread-cutting dies and taps matched the quality of those made of foreign steel. Two months ago, the Jinhua Textile Factory in Shanxi also used indigenous steel to make rollers, steel rings, and spindles, which are the "three treasures" of spinning machines. In the past, they had to rely on imported foreign steel for production, but now they can be self-sufficient with indigenous steel.

          Manufacturing Electric Motors
The exhibition hall makes people realize that indigenous steel and iron can also enter the halls of modernity in the modern world. The exhibits here tell people that indigenous steel and iron will play an important role in achieving rural electrification. Among the exhibits is a transformer, only five inches high and with a power of 40 watts, which can reduce the common voltage of 220 volts to 5-6 volts. This transformer was made by the Beijing Iron and Steel Research Institute using indigenous steel. We know that manufacturing transformers is not difficult, but silicon steel sheets are not easy to find. However, steel strips made of indigenous steel, 0.5-0.35 mm thick, can replace silicon steel sheets. Experiments at the Beijing Iron and Steel Research Institute have proven that, according to the performance of indigenous steel thin plates, larger transformers and motors can be made than this. There is no doubt that indigenous steel can replace silicon steel sheets, so can indigenous steel be made into silicon steel sheets? The answer is also yes. Among the exhibits is a silicon steel sheet, one foot long and six inches wide, recently successfully manufactured by the Fenghuangwo Iron and Steel Plant using crucibles. In the trial production process, workers Chen Zuyin and Kunming Institute of Technology student Dai Weiliang, etc., put 30 jin of low-carbon steel and 15 liang of silicon iron into a crucible for smelting. The smelted silicon steel contained 0.8% silicon, which met the requirements for silicon steel sheets needed to manufacture electric motors. Using this smelting method, it takes three hours per batch, and each batch can produce 70 jin of silicon steel, and the pressed silicon steel sheets are enough to build a five-horsepower electric motor.

          Smelting Special Steel
Indigenous steel can not only be used to manufacture ordinary things, but also can be smelted into various special steels. On display here are high-carbon steel, nickel-chromium steel, stainless steel, high-manganese steel, and ball bearing steel, all of which are smelted in small electric furnaces using indigenous steel as raw material. These steels, after analysis, have reached the requirements of high-grade special steels and can be completely comparable to foreign steels. (Attached picture)

    万紫千红看土钢
    介绍全国钢铁“小土联”麻城现场会议展览馆
    本报记者  袁者萍
    土钢土铁可以做什么用？不少人还在怀疑。甚至有人把土钢贬为“豆腐渣钢”，说它一轧就碎。土钢土铁是不是有用呢？全国钢铁小土联麻城现场会议的展览馆，肯定地回答了这一问题。
    这里陈列着来自河南、河北、湖南、湖北、山西、青海、广西、北京等地的近四百种展品，全是用土钢土铁做的，有粗至千吨重的铸件，有细到几毫米的锻件，铸拉锻打样样都有。
              成  材
    展览馆答复的第一个问题是：土钢能成材。这里展出的有方钢、圆钢、扁钢、带钢、薄板等各种钢材，它们是小型的土洋结合的钢铁联合企业利用三寸来长、一寸厚的炒钢锻坯轧制成功的。它们还利用这些钢材加工成各种金属制品，像钢丝、钢丝绳、轴承、锯条、轧花刀等等。如果全国每个公社都有这样的联合企业，那末五亿农民所需要的钢材绝大部分可以就地取材就地制造了。用土钢轧成的钢材质量怎样呢？这里还是让事实说话吧。像凤凰窝钢铁厂生产的钢丝，直径不到一公厘；还可以用拉出的线材，制成铁钉；把钢丝捻成钢丝绳等。这一切都说明了，土钢只要锻打得好，有效地清除钢中的杂质，质量可以和洋钢媲美。展品中有一条两尺半长的圆钢，光亮夺目，这是大冶钢厂的工人用土钢做成的，他们自豪地称赞它的质量赛过孙悟空的金箍棒，棒上写着这样一首诗：“土钢成型不是神，赛过当年镇海针，放在海里吓龙君，拿在手里气老孙。”
            成  器
    展览馆回答的第二个问题是土钢土铁不仅可以成材，而且还可以造机器、造农业机械，促进农业机械化。在这里展出的有车床、刨床、铣床、钻床等各种土机床，有弹花机、脱粒机、花生剥皮机、解放式水车等各种农业机械，都是人民公社武装自己的机械厂和提高农业生产、进行农产品加工所迫切需要的。麻城县今年向上海、武汉、济南等地订购了一百多台机床，一台也没有到手，遇到拖拉机、动力设备发生故障，得拿到一百三十公里以外的汉口去修，而且还排不上队。现在用土钢土铁造出了车床、刨床、铣床，就有可能来武装自己了。麻城县第一机械厂用土钢生产的稻谷脱粒机三人操作，一天能脱粒一万斤，抵上三十个劳动力。这些展品，不仅本身全部是用土钢土铁造成，有的连加工工具也是用土钢制成的。展览馆有一台四尺五的皮带车床，它的床面、主轴、托板的耐磨性和洋钢造的车床一样，而成本要低一半多。这是湖南攸县农业机械厂的产品。这个厂的工人在生产这台车床时，只有几把老虎钳子和挫刀，到处想买用洋钢造的套丝扣的板牙买不到。最后没有办法，老师傅欧清阶和钳工杨镇华就自己动手用土钢制造。他们把用土钢做的工具，放在头发、牛骨灰、木头灰等七种简单材料调成的水中进行土法热处理，造出的套丝扣板牙、丝攻等工具，质量和洋钢造的相匹配。山西晋华纺织厂在两个月前还用土钢做成了罗拉、钢领和纱锭，这是细纱机的“三宝”，过去必须依靠外来的洋钢生产，现在有了土钢就可以自给自足了。
          造  电  机
    展览馆使人们认识到，土钢土铁在现代化的世界里也可以登堂入室。这里陈列的展品告诉人们，农村实现电气化，土钢土铁将起着重要作用。展品中有一个五寸来高功率为四十瓦的变压器，它能把二百二十伏的常用电压降到五至六伏。这个变压器是北京钢铁研究院用土钢造成的。我们知道，制造变压器并不难，主要是矽钢片不容易找到。而用土钢轧成的0.5—0.35公厘厚的钢带却可以代替矽钢片。北京钢铁研究院试验证明：按照土钢薄板的性能，还可以做比它更大的变压器和电机。土钢能代替矽钢片已经没有疑问，那末土钢能不能制成矽钢片呢？答复也是肯定的。展品中就有一块一尺来长、六寸来宽的矽钢片，这是凤凰窝钢铁厂新近用坩埚制造成功的。在试制过程中，工人陈祖银和昆明工学院的学生戴为梁等用三十斤低炭钢和十五两矽铁放在坩埚里炼，炼出的矽钢含矽0.8％，达到了制造电动机所需矽钢片的要求。用这种冶炼方法，三小时出一次，每次可出七十斤矽钢，压成的矽钢片够造一部五马力的电动机使用。
          炼  特  殊  钢
    土钢不仅可以用来制造一般的东西，还可以炼成各种特殊钢。这里陈列的有高炭钢、镍铬钢、不锈钢、高锰钢、滚珠轴承钢，这些都是用土钢作原料在小电炉里熔炼的。这些钢，经过分析，达到了高级特殊钢的要求，完全可以和洋钢媲美。（附图片）
