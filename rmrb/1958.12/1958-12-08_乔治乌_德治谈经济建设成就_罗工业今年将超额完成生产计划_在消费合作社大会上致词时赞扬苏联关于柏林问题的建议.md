Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest - Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, recently pointed out in a report that, according to preliminary statistics, the 1958 plan for the development of the national economy will be overfulfilled by about 3.5% in industry, and the total industrial output will increase by 9.5% compared with last year.

He also said that the output of milled iron in 1958 will increase 4.6 times compared with 1938, steel 2.3 times, coal 1.6 times, methane 16 times, cement 4.2 times, and oil 1.5 times.

Gheorghiu-Dej made a report on the development of the national economy at the plenary session of the Party Central Committee held from November 26 to 28.

Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that due to the improvement of the wage and labor quota system, the average wage in 1958 will increase by more than 18% compared with 1956.

He also said that all the conditions for realizing the provisions of the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party on the socialist transformation of agriculture have been guaranteed.

The report went on to say that Romania's currency circulation is healthy, the leu (Romanian currency) has been strengthened, and the budget has been stabilized. The quantity and variety of export commodities have increased, which guarantees a trade surplus and a balance of payments.

Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that the rapid development of Romania's socialist economy is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. The Soviet Union provides Romania with the raw materials, first-class industrial equipment, and installations necessary to realize the national industrialization plan.

Gheorghiu-Dej announced that a few days ago, the Romanian side received a letter from Comrade Khrushchev, in which he stated that the Soviet government is willing to provide Romania with further assistance to promote the development of the chemical industry. A Soviet delegation will come in December to sign the corresponding agreement.

When talking about the draft national plan for 1959, Gheorghiu-Dej said that the draft stipulates that next year's national income will increase by 13%, and the total industrial output will increase by 10%. Next year, the national economic investment will increase by 15% compared with this year, and next year will focus on the development of the chemical industry, and the investment in this area will account for 20% of the total national economic investment, an increase of 50% compared with this year. Investment in agriculture will reach 2.9 billion lei, an increase of 600 million lei compared with this year. Investment in social and cultural aspects will increase by 17%, and investment in housing construction will increase by 25%.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Romanian Workers' Party has consistently adopted the policy of industrialization based on the priority development of heavy industry, especially the machinery manufacturing industry. The Party and the government have unswervingly implemented the policy of accumulating the necessary funds for realizing industrialization.

Gheorghiu-Dej finally pointed out that the completion of the industrial production increase task is entirely possible through better use of existing production capacity, shortening the installation period of new equipment, and through workers, technicians, and engineers mastering advanced technology in a short period of time.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 6th - Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, said in Bucharest on the 5th that peace-loving people around the world welcome the Soviet proposals on the Berlin issue with particular satisfaction. Everyone believes that this is a valuable contribution to maintaining peace and consolidating the security of all countries. He said that the Romanian government has issued a statement expressing its firm support for the Soviet government's proposals on the Berlin issue.

Gheorghiu-Dej made these remarks when delivering a congratulatory speech at the opening ceremony of the Third Congress of Romanian Consumer Cooperatives. He also said that the powerful socialist camp, the peace-loving countries of Asia and Africa, the international workers' movement, and the movement of people of all countries to strive for world peace are a huge force unprecedented in human history, a force much stronger than the forces of reaction and war.

He emphasized that the entire capitalist world has increasingly shown signs of the decay of the capitalist system: the struggles of the people of colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America for freedom and national independence are rising, and the decaying colonial system of imperialism is increasingly disintegrating.

He said that contrary to the capitalist world, the economies in the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the socialist camp are showing an all-round upsurge.

In his congratulatory speech, Gheorghiu-Dej talked about the role and tasks of Romanian consumer cooperatives. He said that consumer cooperatives unite workers and peasants who sell agricultural products and supply industrial products, and become a school for millions of peasants. It educates peasants in the spirit of collective labor and helps them transition to advanced cooperative forms of production cooperatives. Cooperatives have made valuable contributions to the development of urban-rural economic ties, to the strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance, and to socialist construction.

He also called on consumer cooperatives to develop ties with other countries. He said that the rich experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries should be learned, and international economic ties should be developed, so as to promote and strengthen friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries.

At the meeting on the 5th, Con. Matescu, Chairman of the Central Union of Romanian Consumer Cooperatives, made a work summary report. He talked about the development of national consumer cooperatives since the Second Congress in 1954. He pointed out that from 1954 to 1958, a total of 4,000 cooperative stores were added nationwide, and now there are a total of 26,000 cooperative stores. The total value of goods sold by cooperative stores increased from 7.2 billion lei (Romanian currency) in 1954 to 10.8 billion lei this year. This year, they ordered 10% more grain seeds and sunflower seeds than in 1954. The fund of consumer cooperatives increased by 60% from 1954 to 1958. The non-liquid fund also nearly doubled during this period.

Matescu also talked about the future work tasks of consumer cooperatives.

The congress was attended by 600 representatives representing 5.2 million members of Romanian consumer cooperatives. Representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries were also invited to attend the congress. (Attached picture)

    罗工业今年将超额完成生产计划
    在消费合作社大会上致词时赞扬苏联关于柏林问题的建议
    新华社布加勒斯特讯  罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治最近在一个报告中指出，据初步统计，1958年发展国民经济计划在工业方面将超额完成3.5％左右，工业总产量将比去年增加9.5％。
    他又说，1958年铣铁的产量将比1938年增加四点六倍，钢增加二点三倍，煤增加一点六倍，甲烷增加十六倍，水泥增加四点二倍，石油增加一点五倍。
    乔治乌—德治在11月26日到28日举行的党中央全会上就发展国民经济问题作了报告。
    乔治乌—德治指出，由于工资和劳动定额制度的改善，1958年平均工资将比1956年增加18％以上。
    他又说，实现罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会关于农业的社会主义改造的规定的一切条件都得到了保证。
    报告接着说，罗马尼亚的货币流通情况是健康的，列伊（罗币）已经加强，预算已经稳定。出口商品的数量和品种都有了增加，这保证了对外贸易的出超和支付的平衡。
    乔治乌—德治着重指出，罗马尼亚社会主义经济的迅速发展是和苏联以及其它兄弟国家的援助分不开的。苏联供给罗马尼亚实现国家工业化计划所必需的原料、头等工业设备和装置。
    乔治乌—德治宣布，几天以前，罗马尼亚方面收到了赫鲁晓夫同志的一封信，信中表示苏联政府愿意给予罗马尼亚进一步的帮助，来促进化学工业的发展。12月份苏联将有一个代表团前来签订相应的协定。
    乔治乌—德治在谈到1959年国家计划草案时说，这个草案规定，明年国民收入将增加13％，工业总产量将增长10％。明年国民经济投资额将比今年增加15％，明年将特别着重发展化学工业，用于这方面的投资额将占国民经济投资总额的20％，比今年增加50％。对农业的投资将达二十九亿列伊，比今年将增加六亿列伊。社会、文化方面的投资将增加17％，住宅建设的投资将增加25％。
    乔治乌—德治说，罗马尼亚工人党一贯采取在优先发展重工业、首先是机器制造业的基础上实行工业化的政策。党和政府坚持不懈地执行为实现工业化取得必要的资金积累的政策。
    乔治乌—德治最后指出，通过更好地利用现有的生产能力，缩短新装备的安装期限以及通过工人、技术人员和工程师们在短期内掌握先进技术，工业增产任务的完成是完全可能的。
    新华社布加勒斯特6日电  罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治同志5日在布加勒斯特说，世界爱好和平的人类以特别满意的心情欢迎苏联关于柏林问题的建议。大家都认为这是对维护和平和巩固各国人民安全的一个宝贵的贡献。他说，罗马尼亚政府已经发表声明，表示坚决支持苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议。
    乔治乌—德治是在罗马尼亚消费合作社第三次代表大会开幕仪式上致祝词时说这番话的。他还说，强大的社会主义阵营，亚非爱好和平的国家，国际工人运动和各国人民争取世界和平的运动是人类历史上从来没有过的一支巨大的力量，是一支比反动和战争势力强大得多的力量。
    他强调说，整个资本主义世界已经越来越多地表现出资本主义体系腐朽的迹象：亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的殖民地、半殖民地和附属国人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争日益高涨，帝国主义腐朽的殖民主义体系正在日益瓦解。
    他说同资本主义世界相反，在苏联、中国和社会主义阵营其他国家中，经济都呈现出全面高涨。
    乔治乌—德治在祝词中谈到了罗马尼亚消费合作社的作用和任务。他说，消费合作社团结了出售农作物和供应工业品的工人和农民，成为千百万农民的学校。它以集体劳动的精神教育农民，帮助他们向生产合作社的先进合作形式过渡。合作社在发展城乡经济联系、在加强工农联盟以及在社会主义建设等方面都做出了宝贵的贡献。
    他还号召消费合作社同其他国家发展联系。他说，应当学习苏联以及其他社会主义国家的丰富经验，发展国际经济联系，从而促进和加强各国人民之间的友谊和合作。
    在5日的会议上，罗马尼亚消费合作社中央联合会主席康·马特斯库曾作了工作总结报告。他谈到了从1954年第二次代表大会以来全国消费合作社的发展情况。他指出，从1954到1958年，全国共增加了四千个合作商店，现在一共有二万六千个合作商店。合作商店销售商品的总值从1954年的七十二亿列伊（罗币）增加到今年的一百零八亿列伊。今年它们订购的谷物种籽和向日葵种籽比1954年多了10％。消费合作社的基金从1954年到1958年增加了60％。这一时期的非流动基金也增加了将近一倍。
    马特斯库还谈到了消费合作社今后的工作任务。
    出席这次代表大会的有代表罗马尼亚五百二十万消费合作社社员的六百名代表。苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的代表也应邀参加了大会。（附图片）
