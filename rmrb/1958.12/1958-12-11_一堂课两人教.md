A factory-run university practices “native and foreign combined” teaching method

Our reporter, Mào Fújūn

The Industrial University run by the Bengbu Machinery Factory in Anhui Province has created a "native and foreign combined" teaching method, which integrates theory with practice and is warmly welcomed by the workers.

The school has seven departments, including Metallurgical Heat Treatment, Metal Structure, Power Machinery, and Special Machinery. There are twenty-one teachers, including five full-time teachers and sixteen part-time teachers. Among the part-time teachers, five are graduates from universities and middle schools, and eleven are experienced veteran workers, the "native teachers."

In early August, when the school first opened, due to lack of experience, the native and foreign teachers each had their own approach to teaching. The "foreign teachers" simply copied the methods of ordinary universities, blindly pursuing standardization, without touching on practical production. They read from the textbook in class, drawing a large number of formulas on the blackboard, writing a string of foreign languages, and requiring the workers to copy notes with their heads down. One "foreign teacher" taught a math class. The first class was full, the second class only had half the students, and the third class only had a few students left, so they had to stop the class. The native teachers only talked about processing techniques and practical operating experience, without talking about theory or principles. Therefore, after giving a few lectures, they also felt they could not continue. Zhang Jiming, a veteran riveter with more than thirty years of production experience, said after giving a few lectures: "I can't do it anymore, please find someone else!" In this way, neither the native nor the foreign teachers could play their proper roles, and neither teaching method could meet the needs of the students. Both native and foreign teachers were very frustrated.

The factory Party committee discovered this situation and immediately held an enlarged meeting of the Party committee, a meeting of all teachers, and a student meeting, to convey the central government's instructions on factories running schools. They mobilized the masses to start with inspecting the implementation of the principle that education must be combined with productive labor, launched a great airing of views, great debate, and criticized the erroneous tendency of teaching being divorced from reality and the masses. They further recognized the great significance of combining native and foreign methods for teaching in improving teaching quality. After discussion and research, they jointly created a set of teaching methods combining native and foreign elements:

(1) Two native and foreign teachers teach one class together. The "native teacher" talks about practice, and the "foreign teacher" talks about theory. For example, when Sun Fugui, the "native teacher" in the Metallurgical Heat Treatment Department, lectured on solid carburization, he only talked about why solid carburization is needed, the ingredients of carburization, the time, temperature, and operating methods of carburization, and other practical production processes. The "foreign teacher" talked about the elements of the carburizing agent, the physical and chemical changes that occur in these elements during carburization, and talked about principles and the calculation of equations.

(2) Native and foreign teachers prepare lessons together and help each other. For example, the "foreign teacher" only knew book knowledge about quenching and annealing, and did not know the actual production situation. The "native teacher" taught him how to look at the flame, how to distinguish the color of the sparks during the day, night, sunny days, and cloudy days, and taught him how to operate the hardness testing machine, etc. When the "native teacher" Zhang Jiming talked about centrifugal blowers, he only knew how to talk about the structure and processing experience, and the "foreign teacher" helped him understand why the fan blades generate wind, speed, and calculations. During lesson preparation, native and foreign teachers jointly compiled teaching materials. The compiled teaching materials generally adopted the principle of four wants and four don'ts: want basic knowledge, don't want overly profound knowledge divorced from reality; want the latest scientific and creative invention knowledge, don't want backward experience and methods; want knowledge related to production practice, don't want knowledge unrelated to production; want knowledge necessary for further study, don't want repetitive knowledge. The workers summarized that the teaching materials compiled in this way have three major advantages: easy to understand; related to practice; and can be used after learning. Native and foreign teachers preparing lessons together and helping each other has many benefits. The "foreign teachers" learned practical production experience from the "native teachers," changed the shortcomings of memorizing books and formulas and only imparting book knowledge. The "native teachers" learned theoretical knowledge from the "foreign teachers," making their experience more systematic, and the lectures were also more lively.

(3) Assign "foreign teachers" to relevant workshops according to their professional nature to participate in labor, as assistants and consultants to the "native teachers," and also as students. They help each other, learn from each other, and research together in joint labor, which has played a significant role in improving teaching quality.

(4) Native and foreign teachers sometimes lecture in the classroom, and sometimes move to the workshop to give on-site explanations, according to needs. For example, when the Power Machinery Department lectures on engines, they first talk about the various parts, then the structure and performance, and then the principle formulas. After class, they go to the workshop to disassemble the engine for specific explanation. Yu Jishan, a teacher in the Tool Machinery Department, used the gantry planer produced by the factory to explain, pointing out the machine's structural performance, advantages, calculation formulas, and compared it with similar machines, analyzed the advantages and disadvantages, and mobilized everyone to use their brains and create.

(5) Native and foreign teachers provide after-school tutoring to students. When the "native teacher" teaches, the "foreign teacher" attends the class. When the "foreign teacher" teaches, the "native teacher" also attends the class. If they find something that has not been thoroughly explained, they supplement each other after class to help students further understand the content of the course.

After the Industrial University of Bengbu Machinery Factory adopted this teaching method combining native and foreign elements, the teaching quality has been continuously improved and has been warmly supported by students. They said: "It's really interesting to teach like this." "This is a university suitable for us workers, with theory and practice. We now have the confidence to continue learning." Since the adoption of the teaching method combining native and foreign elements, the attendance rate has been very normal. Students composed a folk song saying: "Teaching reform is really good, theory and practice are closely combined, learning and applying at the same time makes rapid progress, and production leaps forward and innovation increases."

Combining native and foreign elements is not only a good way to improve teaching quality, but also a good way to promote the rapid improvement of the political and ideological level and professional level of native and foreign teachers. The "foreign teachers" enriched their practical production knowledge in teaching and labor, and also received help from veteran workers, and their thinking has also been transformed. The "native teachers" also enriched their theoretical knowledge in the teaching process, rapidly improved their professional level, and also promoted production.

    一堂课两人教
    本报记者  冒茀君
    安徽省蚌埠机械厂办的工业大学，创造了一种“土洋结合”的教学方法，使理论与实际结合起来，受到工人们的热烈欢迎。
    这个学校共有冶金热处理、金属结构、动力机械、特种机械等七个系。教师有二十一人，其中专职教师五人，兼职教师十六人。在兼职教师中，大、中学出身的教师五人，有丰富的生产经验的老工人“土教师”十一人。
    8月初，学校刚办时，由于缺乏经验，土、洋教师在教学中各有一套。“洋教师”在教课时照搬普通大学的一套，一味追求正规化，不接触生产实际，讲课时照本宣读，在黑板上画一大片公式，写一大串洋文，要工人闷着头抄笔记。有个“洋教师”讲数学课，第一堂满坐，第二堂只到二分之一，第三堂只剩下几个学生，不得不停课。土教师只讲加工工艺和实际操作经验，不讲理论、原理。因而讲几堂课以后也感到讲不下去。具有三十多年生产经验的老铆工张济铭讲几堂课后说：“干不下去了，你们另请高明吧！”这样，土洋教师都不能发挥应有的作用，两种教学都不能满足学生们的要求。土洋教师都很苦闷。
    厂党委发现这一情况，立即召开党委扩大会、全体教师会、学生会，传达中央关于工厂办学校的指示，发动群众从检查贯彻教育必须与生产劳动相结合的方针入手，开展大鸣大放大辩论，批判了教学脱离实际、脱离群众的错误倾向，进一步认识了土洋结合进行教学对提高教学质量的重大意义。经过讨论研究，共同创造了土洋结合的一套教学办法：
    （一）一堂课土洋教师两人上，“土教师”讲实际，“洋教师”讲理论，如冶金热处理系“土教师”孙富贵在讲固体渗炭这一课时，他只讲为什么要固体渗炭，渗炭的配料，渗炭的时间、温度和操作方法等实际生产过程，而“洋教师”讲渗炭剂的原素，这些原素在渗炭过程中发生的物理变化和化学变化，讲原理，讲方程式的计算等。
    （二）土洋教师一起备课，互相帮助。如“洋教师”讲淬火和退火，只知书本知识，不知实际生产情况，“土教师”教他如何看火头，白天、黑夜、晴天、阴天如何区别火花的颜色，教他操作硬度机等。“土教师”张济铭在讲离心式鼓风机时，只知道讲结构和加工经验，而“洋教师”就帮助他理解为什么风叶会生风、转速、计算等。在备课时，土、洋教师共同编写教材。编写的教材一般都采取了四要四不要的原则：要基础知识，不要脱离实际的过于深奥的知识；要最新的科学和创造发明的知识，不要落后的经验办法；要与生产实际联系的知识，不要与生产无关的知识；要深造必须的知识，不要重复的知识。这样编写的教材，工人总结有三大优点：通俗易懂；联系实际；学了就能用。土洋教师共同备课，互相帮助，好处很多，“洋教师”向“土教师”学习了生产实际经验，改变了死啃书本、背公式只是传授书本知识的缺点，“土教师”向“洋教师”学习了理论知识，使自己的经验更加系统化，课程也讲的更加生动。
    （三）把“洋教师”按专业性质分到有关车间参加劳动，作为“土教师”的助手、顾问，又是学生。他们在共同劳动中互相帮助，互相学习，互相研究，对提高教学质量起了重大作用。
    （四）土、洋教师在讲课时、根据需要有时在课堂上讲，有时就搬到车间进行现场讲解。如动力机械系讲发动机时，先讲各门部件，再讲结构、性能，然后讲原理公式，课后又到车间把发动机拆开具体讲解。工具机械系教师俞基善利用本厂生产的龙门刨床进行讲解，指出该机器的构造性能、优点、计算的公式，并与同类机器比较，分析优缺点，发动大家开动脑筋，进行创造。
    （五）土洋教师互相对学生进行课后辅导。“土教师”上课时，“洋教师”参加听课，“洋教师”上课时，“土教师”也参加听课。发现没有讲透的地方，课后互相补充，帮助学生进一步理解课程的内容。
    蚌埠机械厂工业大学采用这种土洋结合的教学办法以后，教学质量不断提高，受到学生的热烈拥护。他们说：“这样讲得真有味。”“这才是适合我们工人上的大学，有理论又有实际。我们现在有信心学习下去了。”自从采用土洋结合的教学方法以后，学习出勤率一直很正常。学生编了一首民歌说：“教学改革真正好，理论实际紧结合，边学边用进步快，生产跃进革新多。”
    土洋结合，不仅是提高教学质量的好办法，而且也是促进土洋教师政治思想水平和业务水平迅速提高的好办法。“洋教师”在教学中在劳动中丰富了自己的实际生产知识，同时受到老工人的帮助，思想也得到了改造。而“土教师”在教学过程中也丰富了理论知识，迅速提高了业务水平，对生产也起了促进作用。
