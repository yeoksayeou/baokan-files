    The First Day as an Apprentice
    Zhang Lübing, Seventh Construction Site, Chengdu Construction Engineering Bureau

    Originally, I was going to sign an apprenticeship contract with Master Cheng. But as soon as I entered the carpentry shed, both Master Gao and Master Wang eagerly told me:
    “Press down hard on the back of the plane, and push it out with force.”
    I held the plane with both hands, my heart pounding in my chest, and stood in a horse stance, pushing it out. Strange! The plane either ran on the surface of the wood or the head plunged downward, making me sweat profusely. Master Gao said with a smile:
    “Little Zhang, don’t worry. Take it slow, two days to chop, three years to plane. Once you learn to plane, chopping and sawing will be easy.” As he spoke, he took the plane and showed me how to plane.
    I thought to myself: The “contract” stipulates that I should reach the level of a third-grade worker in half a year, but planing alone will take three years, how can this work? So, before Master Gao could push the plane over, I immediately took it and imitated him, and the plane immediately flew and raced across the rough material.
    After a while, Master Gao gently patted me again and said:
    “Little Zhang, let me teach you how to set the plane, remove the plane, and sharpen the blade. The edge of the blade should be even and straight, and when sharpening, it should be blue. Otherwise, it will be white.” After he installed the plane blade, he tried it on the material a few times and said: If the plane is too old, tap the tail; if it’s too new, tap the blade.
    I replied to Master Gao with silent excitement.
    Time passed little by little, and the plane blade became dull. I took off the blade and stood blankly by the whetstone, unable to get a consistent edge when sharpening. Just as I was in a dilemma, my master came over. He seemed to understand my concerns and said kindly to me:
    “When you first learn, don’t grip the plane too tightly, otherwise your hands will blister. If you get tired, rest for a while before continuing.”
    My master’s care brought tears to my eyes.
    In the afternoon, I learned how to sharpen the blade.

    当徒工的第一天
    成都市建筑工程局第七工地  张履冰
    本来，我是跟程师傅订师徒合同的。可是，刚一进木工棚，高师傅王师傅都争着告诉我：
    “刨子后手要按紧，使劲碰出去。”
    我双手捏着刨子，心像要跳出胸膛，站好骑马式，将它碰出去。怪！刨子不是在木板面上跑，就是刨头往下栽，气得我满头大汗。高师傅笑容满脸地说：
    “小张，别着急。慢慢地来嘛，二天砍，三年刨。只要学会了刨，砍、杀就容易了。”说着说着，他把刨接过去又教我怎样刨。
    我暗地里在想：“合同”上订的半年达到三级工水平，光是刨就要三年，这咋行？于是，我不等高师傅把刨推过去，马上拿过手，依样画葫芦，刨子立刻在粗料上飞舞、奔驰。
    过了一会，高师傅又轻轻地拍我一下说：
    “小张，让我教你上刨、下刨、磨刀。刀要齐口子，磨起口子，就是青的。相反，就是白的。”他把刨刀擦子上好后，在料上又试了几下说：刨子老了，敲刨尾；嫩了，敲刨刀。
    我用无言的激动，回答高师傅。
    时间又一点地过去了，刨刀刨钝了。我下掉刀，走到磨刀石旁发楞，磨起口子，的确拿不一。正在为难，我的师傅来了，他似乎了解我的心事，亲切的向我说：
    “初学时候，捏刨不能过紧，否则手会起泡，累了，休息会儿再干。”
    师傅对我的关怀，使我流下了泪。
    下午，我就学会了磨刀。
