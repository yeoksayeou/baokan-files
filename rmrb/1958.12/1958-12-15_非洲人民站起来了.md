The All-African People's Conference, marking the great unity of the African people, successfully concluded in Accra, the capital of Ghana, on December 13. More than 300 representatives from 62 organizations in 28 countries gathered to discuss various issues related to African national independence, and unanimously adopted important declarations and resolutions on colonialism and imperialism, and demanding that colonial countries withdraw from the territories they occupy. This is the first large-scale non-governmental gathering held in Africa, and it will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the unity and strength of the African people in the struggle against colonialism, and powerfully promote the development of the African national independence movement. Therefore, not only are all African people elated by the positive achievements of this conference, but peace-loving people all over the world also express their warm welcome and support.

For a long time, Africa has been the "reserve continent" for imperialist colonial expansion, and Western colonialists have run rampant and plundered at will on this rich land. However, after the Second World War, especially after the historically significant Bandung Conference and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the movement for national independence in Africa has spread like wildfire across the entire continent. In April of this year, the Conference of Independent African States was held. Subsequently, Algeria and Guinea successively declared their independence. At present, the area of independent African countries accounts for more than one-third of the total area of Africa, and the population is also nearly half of the total African population. Colonial dependencies that have not yet gained independence and freedom are also taking various forms to fight against imperialism. It is expected that by 1960, Nigeria, Cameroon, Togo, and Italian Somaliland will also become independent countries. The "last line of defense" of the colonial system has further collapsed, indicating that the African people who are actively fighting for independence and freedom are invincible. In the new situation of the African people's continuous victories, the convening of the All-African People's Conference is obviously of great significance.

The All-African People's Conference reflected the rising anti-colonial sentiment of the African people. The delegates exposed the ugly face of the colonial system with irrefutable facts. The "Declaration and Resolutions on Imperialism and Colonialism" adopted by the conference severely condemned the aggressive activities of imperialism and colonialism. The declaration condemned "the evil system of colonialism and imperialism in British and French African colonies" and expressed "angry protest against this ugly system." The declaration specifically pointed out that "this system manifests its extremely cruel form particularly in Algeria, Cameroon, Central Africa, Kenya, South Africa, Portuguese Angola, Mozambique, Principe, and Sao Tome." The declaration also condemned "the exploitation of natural resources and manpower in these regions." "No interference in Africa, Africa must be free!" "We have an obligation to completely liberate Africa now!" These powerful voices resounded throughout the venue of the All-African People's Conference, and also throughout the entire Africa from Bissau to the Cape of Good Hope! It fully demonstrates the determination and confidence of the African people to completely drive imperialism out of the entire African continent.

Racial discrimination and racial persecution are the result of imperialist aggression and occupation of African colonies, and they have brought deep suffering to the African people. People who suffer from discrimination and persecution are often attacked by hunger and disease, and their lives are not guaranteed. The resolution passed by the All-African People's Conference severely condemned "apartheid, the reservation system, and all other forms of racial discrimination and segregation," and particularly condemned "the political policies of using the social principles of apartheid as the basis for the rule of the minority over the majority in regions such as Central and South Africa." The resolution also stipulated that "the conference will establish a human rights commission to study complaints of human rights violations in various parts of Africa and take appropriate measures to ensure that everyone enjoys various rights." This is support for the vast African people who have suffered from racial discrimination and persecution, and is a blow to the inhumane colonialists and racists.

The African people, who have waged a long struggle against imperialism, deeply understand the importance of unity. Although the delegates came from different countries, different parties, and different classes, they have a common goal in the struggle against colonialism and for national independence. This spirit of unity is reflected in the speeches of many delegates and the resolutions of the conference. The resolution calls on countries that have gained independence to provide all possible assistance to colonial dependencies. In order to divide the national revolutionary forces of the African people, imperialism has resorted to the most despicable and shameless means of sowing discord, but the awakened African people will not be deceived. They will further unite under the banner of anti-colonialism and move forward along the road of independence and freedom.

Faced with the magnificent African national liberation movement, imperialism was panicked. It attempted to prevent the development of the national independence movement by using both intimidation and deception. In particular, American imperialism, which flaunts the banner of "anti-colonialism," wants to take the opportunity to squeeze out Britain and France, intervene in Africa, and expand its colonial power. On the eve of the opening of the All-African People's Conference, US Assistant Secretary of State Satterthwaite specifically visited several African countries. He stated that the United States was watching the convening of this conference with great "interest." The United States also specially dispatched a large number of "observers" to attend the conference, and these so-called "observers" secretly carried out various activities in an attempt to exert influence on the conference, thereby leading the conference in a direction that was beneficial to the colonialists. But the results of the conference proved that the imperialist conspiracies did not achieve their expected results. W.E.B. Du Bois, the founder of the Pan-African movement, said well in his congratulatory letter to the All-African People's Conference that the African people must be careful about the concessions of Western colonialists. These words have been valued by the African people.

In Africa, as in Asia and Latin America, the national independence movement has become an unstoppable historical trend. All people who have been oppressed by imperialism and colonialism have become increasingly aware that they are no longer willing to live as before. A bold slogan was written at the venue of the All-African People's Conference: "African people unite! We have nothing to lose but our chains, and we will regain the entire continent." The Chinese people firmly believe that the day when the African people fully realize this slogan and drive all imperialists out of Africa is not far away.

The African people have stood up. The struggle of the African people will surely be victorious.

### 非洲人民站起来了

    非洲人民站起来了
    标志着非洲人民大团结的全非人民大会，已于12月13日在加纳首都阿克拉胜利闭幕。来自二十八个国家的六十二个组织的三百多名代表，济济一堂，共同讨论了有关非洲民族独立的各项问题，一致通过了关于殖民主义和帝国主义和要求殖民国家从它们所占领的领土上撤走等重要宣言和决议。这是第一次在非洲举行的规模盛大的民间性集会，它无疑地将大大加强非洲人民在反对殖民主义斗争中的团结和力量，并有力地推动非洲民族独立运动的发展。因此，不仅全非洲人民对这次会议所获得的积极成就感到欢欣鼓舞，而且全世界爱好和平的人民也表示热烈欢迎和支持。
    长期以来，非洲一直是帝国主义进行殖民扩张的“后备大陆”，西方殖民者在这块富饶的土地上横行霸道，恣意掠夺。但是，在第二次世界大战以后，特别在具有历史意义的万隆会议和亚非人民团结大会以后，非洲争取民族独立的运动有如燎原烈火，燃遍了整个大陆。在今年4月间，召开了非洲独立国家会议。接着，阿尔及利亚和几内亚相继宣布独立。目前，非洲独立国家的面积已占全非洲面积的三分之一以上，人口也将近全非洲人口的一半。而尚未获得独立自由的殖民地附属国，也在采取各种形式同帝国主义进行斗争。预计到1960年，尼日利亚、喀麦隆、多哥和意属索马里兰也将成为独立的国家。殖民主义制度的“最后防线”已经进一步崩溃，这说明积极为独立自由而斗争的非洲人民是不可战胜的。在非洲人民不断取得胜利的新形势下，全非人民大会的召开，显然具有重要的意义。
    全非人民大会反映了非洲人民日益高涨的反对殖民主义的情绪。与会代表用无可辩驳的事实揭发了殖民制度的丑恶面目。会议所通过的“关于帝国主义和殖民主义”的宣言和决议，对帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略活动进行了严厉的谴责。宣言谴责了“在英属和法属非洲殖民地中的殖民主义和帝国主义罪恶制度”，并对“这种丑恶的制度表示愤怒的抗议”。宣言特别指出“这种制度在阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、中非、怯尼亚、南非、葡属安哥拉、莫三鼻给、普林西比和圣多美特别表现了它的极度残酷的形式”。这个宣言还谴责了“对这些地区的天然资源和人力的剥削”。“不许干涉非洲，非洲必须自由！”“我们有义务在现在完全解放非洲！”这些强有力的声音响彻了全非人民大会的会场，也响彻了从比塞大到好望角的整个非洲！它充分表现了非洲人民要把帝国主义彻底赶出整个非洲大陆的决心和信心。
    种族歧视和种族迫害是帝国主义侵略和占领非洲殖民地的结果，它给非洲人民带来了深重的灾难。遭受歧视和迫害的人民经常处在饥饿和疾病的袭击下，生活得不到保障。全非人民大会通过的决议严厉地谴责“种族隔离、保留制度以及种族歧视和肤色隔离的其他一切形式”，特别谴责了“中非和南非等地区以种族隔离的社会原则作为少数统治多数的基础的政治政策”。决议还规定“大会设立人权委员会以研究非洲各地侵犯人权的控诉，并采取适当措施以保证人人享受各种权利”。这是对于一切遭受种族歧视和迫害的非洲广大人民的支持，是对于惨无人道的殖民主义和种族主义者的打击。
    同帝国主义进行了长期斗争的非洲人民，深深了解团结一致的重要性。尽管代表们来自不同的国家、不同的党派和不同的阶层，但是在反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争中却有着共同的目标。这种团结一致的精神表现在许多代表的发言和大会的决议中。决议要求已经获得独立的国家对殖民地附属国提供一切可能的援助。帝国主义为了分化非洲人民的民族革命力量，不惜采用最卑鄙无耻的手段进行挑拨离间，但是已经觉醒了的非洲人民是不会受骗的。他们将在反对殖民主义的旗帜下进一步团结起来，沿着独立自由的道路迈进。
    面对着波澜壮阔的非洲民族解放运动，帝国主义惊慌了。它企图用威吓和诱骗兼施的办法阻止民族独立运动的发展。特别是打着“反殖民主义”幌子的美帝国主义，更想乘机排挤英国和法国，插足非洲，以扩大自己的殖民势力。在全非人民大会开幕的前夕，美国助理国务卿萨脱斯威脱特意访问了几个非洲国家。他表示美国怀着极大的“兴趣”注视着这次会议的召开。美国还特别派遣了大批“观察员”出席会议，这些所谓“观察员”却在暗中进行了各种活动，企图对大会施加影响，从而把大会引向有利于殖民主义者的方向。但是会议的结果证明，帝国主义的阴谋活动并没有达到他们预期的结果。泛非运动创始人杜波依斯在给全非人民大会的贺信中说得好，对于西方殖民者的让步，非洲人民必须小心。这些话受到非洲人民的重视。
    在非洲，也同在亚洲和拉丁美洲一样，民族独立运动已经成为势不可挡的历史潮流。一切遭受帝国主义和殖民主义压迫的人民已经日益觉醒起来，他们再也不愿意照旧生活下去了。在全非人民大会会场上写着一句豪迈的口号：“非洲人民团结起来！我们失去的只是枷锁，我们将重新得到的是整个大陆。”中国人民深深相信，非洲人民完全实现这句口号，把帝国主义全部赶出非洲的日子，是不会很远了。
    非洲人民已经站起来了。非洲人民的斗争一定能够取得胜利。
