From "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes":
　　The commune must also be responsible for running primary schools, middle schools, and adult education. It is necessary to popularize primary school education in all rural areas of the country, run full-time middle schools and part-time agricultural middle schools, or other secondary vocational schools, and gradually achieve universal secondary education.
　　
Unified Leadership Comprehensive Planning Rational Adjustment
　　Communes Run Education Universal Education
　　This newspaper reports that after the realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, a new change is taking place in education. The fundamental aspect of this change is that educational work is placed under the strong leadership of the Party, further realizing the principle of all the people running schools and all the people studying, serving education for the proletariat, combining education with productive labor, and providing favorable conditions for better implementing the Party's education policy.
　　In our country, rural education has greatly developed since liberation, and this year, with the leap forward in production, education has seen another great leap. However, since the upsurge of communization in rural areas this autumn, the original small agricultural and sideline production cooperatives have evolved into large-scale people's communes integrating industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce. The rapid development of production urgently requires the training of a large number of construction talents, and the people's communes also have stronger political conditions and more material conditions than the cooperatives to run schools. Therefore, education in various places has experienced a new high tide with communization. In Yuxian County, Henan Province, after communization, the number of children entering kindergartens increased by nearly 30% compared with before communization, the number of primary school students increased from about 90% of school-age children to 99.2%, the number of junior high school classes increased from 117 classes with 5,831 students to 223 classes with 11,649 students, an increase of nearly doubled. The number of students in spare-time middle schools has increased by about four times, and 37 new red and expert universities specializing in teachers' training, finance and trade, sports, literature and art, medicine, and military affairs have been established.
　　In various places, people's communes are closely integrated in the horizontal aspects of industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce. In education, from nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, and some communes have even established universities, forming the prototype of a new education system. According to materials from some communes in Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces, people's communes generally run schools at three levels: the commune management committee, work area or brigade, and production team. There are three types of schools: full-time schools, part-work and part-study schools, and spare-time schools. In some places, commune spare-time schools have four lines: one is spare-time cultural and technical schools for the masses to learn after getting rid of illiteracy, one is spare-time normal schools for training teachers, one is red and expert schools for cadres to study, and one is professional schools for training various technical talents. All are built according to the needs of the state, the characteristics and needs of the commune itself, and the different educational objects. Yangzhuang People's Commune in Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, has built a set of educational systems from kindergarten to university and a set of spare-time education systems for adults. The entire commune has six kindergartens, twenty-two primary schools, one ordinary middle school, one part-farming and part-study agricultural middle school, one 10,000-jin university, one literary and art school, one spare-time red and expert university, two hundred and twenty-three spare-time cultural and technical schools, and twenty-three spare-time secondary vocational schools, including finance and economics schools for brigade and squad accountants, post and telecommunications schools for training postmen and telephone operators, and schools for chemical industry, health, veterinary medicine, architecture, and normal education.
　　The schools run by the people's communes are directly connected with production and the working people. The establishment of the commune provides extremely favorable conditions for the combination of education and productive labor. Many people's communes have made unified arrangements, allocating experimental fields, livestock, farm tools, vehicles, seeds, and fertilizers to the schools in the commune, helping the schools run factories, and incorporating production into the commune's plan, solving the material conditions for students to participate in productive labor in one fell swoop. Because the commune has more people and greater strength, after communization, reasonable arrangements have gradually been made for the teaching and labor time of schools from a long-term perspective, so that schools are neither purely teaching without labor nor excessively laboring with too little learning. In many places, agricultural middle schools have been further guaranteed since the establishment of the commune, and some agricultural middle schools have begun to consider appropriately increasing basic courses such as physics and chemistry in addition to the original teaching mainly focused on politics and agricultural technology.
　　In the great development of education before the people's communes, a large number of schools were established in various places. When the people's communes were established, a batch of public schools were transferred to the people's communes for management by the people's communes. All these schools were not completely balanced in terms of regional distribution, teachers, and equipment conditions. Some were one class and one school, with one teacher performing all the tasks; some schools were too crowded, and some schools were too small to form a class. After the establishment of the people's commune, a unified arrangement was made for education in combination with the rural long-term plan and the political center of the current commune organization, and the school network was rationally adjusted according to the commune's natural terrain, political organization, equipment conditions, teachers, student conditions, and other conditions. Some schools were merged as needed and as possible. After such adjustments, the school's equipment and teachers were concentrated, and the uneven number and age of students in classes were overcome, facilitating teaching and productive labor.
　　The most prominent point of running schools in people's communes is strengthening the Party's leadership over education. After the realization of people's communes in various places, the Party organizations at all levels of the commune changed the past situation of not asking or rarely asking about education, broke the mysterious concept of education, set up specialized agencies, assigned special personnel, and resolutely grasped education like production. After the realization of communization in Suiping County, Henan Province, the entire county unified leadership, decentralized management, delegated power, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of grass-roots Party organizations and the masses. All schools in the county were led by Party organizations at all levels of the commune, and the secretaries of the Party committee also served as principals of some schools. The Party committee of Bailong People's Commune in Jiange County, Sichuan Province, adopted "five unifications" and "three grasps" for education. The five unifications are: unified arrangement, unified deployment, unified inspection, unified reporting, and unified evaluation of education and other work. The three grasps are: grasping the implementation of the Party's policies in education, grasping the improvement of teaching quality, and grasping the ideological and political education of teachers. The commune Party committee also established a system for regularly studying and inspecting school work. The Party committee of the people's commune provides support to the school in all aspects. The cadres responsible for the Party committee teach in the school, help the school formulate teaching plans and implementation methods, guide the compilation of teaching materials, and solve teaching difficulties. The Party committees of various communes also lead the schools to carry out teaching reforms.
　　Running schools in people's communes is loved by the masses in various places. Someone in East China sang:
　　In the past, I envied paradise, but I didn't know where it was,
　　Realizing the forty articles, paradise is everywhere,
　　The old learn, the young learn, everyone enters the school,
　　The old sing, the young sing, everyone is happy.

### 统一领导  全面安排  合理调整  公社办教育  全民受教育

    公社还必须负责办好小学、中学和成人教育。要在全国农村中普及小学教育，办好全日制的中学和半日制的农业中学，或者其他中等职业学校，逐步做到普及中等教育。
                      ——摘自“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”
    统一领导  全面安排  合理调整
    公社办教育  全民受教育
    本报讯  全国农村实现人民公社化以后，在教育事业方面已在发生着一个新的变化。这一变化的根本方面，就是：教育工作置于党的坚强领导下，进一步实现全民办学校全民学习，为教育为无产阶级服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，更好地贯彻党的教育方针，提供了有利的条件。
    在我国，农村教育事业在解放后已有极大的发展，今年上半年随着生产的跃进，教育事业又来了一个大的飞跃。但秋季农村掀起公社化高潮以来，原来小型的以农、副业为主的生产合作社，进而成为合工、农、兵、学、商为一体的大型的人民公社，由于生产飞速发展而迫切要求培养出大批建设人材，同时人民公社也比合作社具备了更强的政治条件和更多的物质条件来兴办学校，所以各地教育事业随着公社化又出现了一个新的洪峰。河南省禹县公社化以后，入幼儿园儿童比公社化前增加近30％，小学生由占适龄儿童的90％左右增加到99.2％，初中由原来的一百一十七班计五千八百三十一人，增加到二百二十三班一万一千六百四十九人，增长将近一倍，业余中学学生人数增加了四倍左右，还新建师范、财贸、体育、文艺、医学、军事等专业红专大学三十七所。
    各地人民公社在横的方面是工、农、兵、学、商紧密地结成一体，教育方面从托儿所、幼儿园、小学、中学，有的公社还成立了大学，形成一个新的教育体系的雏形。从江苏、河南、湖北、四川等省一部分公社的材料看，人民公社一般是公社管理委员会、作业区或大队、生产队的三级办学。办学形式有全日制学校，半工半读、半耕半读学校，业余学校等三类。有些地方的公社业余学校有四条线，一条是群众脱离文盲状态后学习的业余文化技术学校，一条是培养师资的业余师范，一条是干部学习的红专学校，一条是培养各类技术人才的专业学校。都是按照国家的要求，公社本身的特点和需要，分别教育的对象，建起各种类型的学校。江苏省溧阳县杨庄人民公社建成一套从幼儿直到大学的教育体系和一套成年人的业余教育体系，全公社有幼儿园六所，小学二十二所，普通中学一所；半耕半读的农业中学和万斤大学各一所，文艺学校一所；业余红专大学一所，业余文化技术学校二百二十三所，业余中等专业学校二十三所，其中有为大队、中队会计举办的财经学校，培养邮递员和电话员的邮电学校，以及化工、卫生、兽医、建筑、师范等学校。
    人民公社所办的学校，都是直接和生产，和劳动人民联系，公社的成立为教育与生产劳动相结合提供了极为有利的条件。许多地方的人民公社统一安排，给社内学校拨试验地，牲畜，农具，车辆，种籽，肥料等，帮助学校办工厂，把生产纳入公社计划以内，一举解决了学校学生参加生产劳动的物质条件。由于公社人多力量大，因此各地公社化以后，对于学校教学和劳动时间，也从长远利益来考虑，逐步作出合理安排，使学校既非光教学不劳动，也不致劳动太多学习太少。许多地方的农业中学，自从公社成立后，半耕半读进一步得到保证，有的农业中学在原来以政治和农业技术为主的教学外，开始考虑适当地增加物理、化学等基础课。
    在人民公社化以前的教育大发展中，各地办起大量的学校，在建立人民公社时，又有一批公立学校下放到人民公社，由人民公社管理。所有这些学校，过去在地区分布以及师资、设备条件等方面，并不是完全平衡的，有的是一班一校，一个教师唱“全武行”；有的学校人多挤不下，有的学校又人少开不成班。在人民公社成立后，一般都结合农村远景规划和当前公社组织的政治中心，对教育初步作了统一的安排，按照公社自然地形、政治组织、设备条件、师资力量、学生情况等条件，合理地调整了学校网，一部分学校根据需要和可能加以合并。这样经过调整以后，学校的设备和师资力量集中，学生班级人数和年龄不匀的现象得到克服，便利于教学和生产劳动。
    人民公社办学，最突出的一点，就是加强了党对教育的领导。各地实现人民公社化以后，公社各级党组织一改过去不问或很少问教育的情况，打破了对教育的神秘观念，设立专门机构，指派专人，把教育和生产一样，坚决地抓起来。河南省遂平县实现公社化后，对于教育，全县统一领导，分级管理，权力下放，充分发挥基层党组织和广大群众的积极性，全县所有学校都由公社各级党组织分别领导，有些学校的校长也由党委书记兼任。四川省剑阁县白龙人民公社，党委对教育采“五统一”和“三抓”，五统一是：教育和其它工作统一安排，统一布置，统一检查，统一汇报，统一评比，三抓是：抓党的方针在教育中的贯彻执行，抓教学质量的提高，抓教师的思想和政治教育，公社党委并建立了定期研究、检查学校工作的制度。人民公社的党委从各方面给予学校以支持，党委负责干部在学校兼课，帮助学校制订教学计划和实行的办法，指导编写教材，解决教学上的困难等。各地公社党委还领导学校进行教学改革。
    人民公社办学，在各地受到群众的热爱。华东地区有人唱：
    昔日羡天堂，不知在何方，
    实现四十条，到处是天堂，
    老的学少的学，人人进学堂，
    老的唱少的唱，人人喜洋洋。
                  （魏文华）（附图片）
