Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: The "Committee of Twenty-One" of the Americas, which began on November 17th, ended hastily on December 12th after dragging on for more than three weeks.

It is reported that this meeting was held under the guise of seeking so-called "economic cooperation" between American countries and discussing the United States' "aid" to Latin American countries. However, the meeting concluded with only empty suggestions regarding the United States "funding" Latin American countries, strengthening technical "assistance," and a proposal that "actually requires the United States to impose import quotas on Latin American coffee." This shows that the urgent economic problems faced by Latin American countries due to the impact of US policies remain unresolved.

US Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Douglas Dillon read a letter from Eisenhower at the closing session, which hypocritically guaranteed that the United States would "fully cooperate to help the Americas develop their economies more rapidly." However, it is reported that the United States still insisted on its predatory policies towards Latin American countries at this meeting.

Many Latin American representatives expressed at the meeting the urgent need for the United States to make some concessions to these countries on the issue of loan methods and stabilizing raw material markets. Regarding the loan issue, Latin American countries demanded that the United States implement "a large-scale, long-term assistance plan," the main point of which was to require the US government to contribute to the proposed "Inter-American Bank" in order to obtain the funds needed for these countries to overcome economic difficulties and develop their economies under conditions with slightly more control than private investment. However, the United States was not enthusiastic about contributing to the "Inter-American Bank." When discussing the establishment of the "Inter-American Bank," US representatives verbally expressed "agreement," but when pressed by Latin American representatives, they never indicated how much the US government was prepared to invest.

It is reported that in order to improve the increasingly deteriorating foreign trade situation, Latin American representatives also proposed at the meeting that the United States participate in signing an agreement to stabilize the prices of major commodities and another proposal on setting coffee import quotas. US representative Thomas Mann expressed "sympathy" for the plight of these southern neighbors, but on the other hand, he remained noncommittal to the proposal put forward by the El Salvadoran representative, which essentially required the United States to guarantee a certain amount of coffee imports as a way to stabilize coffee exports and prices.

According to Western news agencies, because the United States did not show any sincerity in helping Latin American countries overcome their economic difficulties throughout the meeting, the US attitude was criticized from the beginning of the meeting, and the meeting repeatedly reached a deadlock from the outset. Brazilian representative Schmidt first expressed disappointment with Dillon's speech. He said that if Washington does not provide $3 billion in funds to support Brazilian President Kubitschek's proposed "Pan American Plan," "it will have to turn to trade with the Soviet Union and Communist China." He said that although doing so "has risks," "it is better than the risk of economic stagnation." According to Agence France-Presse in Washington before the closing of the meeting, in subsequent meetings, representatives of other countries criticized the United States based on the spirit of the Brazilian speech, "putting the United States in a delicate situation of internal rebellion in the American family."

### 美国假仁假义引起普遍不满  美洲国家会议不欢而散

    美国假仁假义引起普遍不满
    美洲国家会议不欢而散
    据新华社15日讯  华盛顿消息：从上月17日开始举行的美洲“二十一国委员会”会议在延宕了三个多星期之后在12月12日草草结束。
    据报道，这次会议是在寻求所谓美洲国家之间的“经济合作”和讨论美国“援助”拉丁美洲国家的名目下举行的。但是会议结束时只通过了关于美国“资助”拉丁美洲国家、加强技术“援助”以及一项“实际上要求美国对拉丁美洲的咖啡实行进口定额”的一些空洞建议，这表明拉丁美洲国家由于受到美国政策的影响而在经济上所面临的亟待解决的问题仍然悬而未决。
    美国国务院主持经济事务的副国务卿狄龙在闭幕会上宣读了艾森豪威尔的一封信，这封信假惺惺地保证美国将为“帮助美洲更迅速地发展经济而进行充分合作”。但是据报道，美国就在这次会议上仍然坚持它对拉丁美洲国家的掠夺性政策。
    许多拉丁美洲国家的代表在这次会议上表示迫切要求美国在贷款方式和稳定原料市场的问题上向这些国家作些让步。关于贷款问题，拉丁美洲国家要求美国实行“一个大规模的长期援助计划”，其中主要的一点是要求美国政府出资参加拟议中的“泛美银行”，以便在一种比私人投资稍有控制的条件下取得这些国家为克服经济困难和发展本国经济所需的资金。但是，美国在出资参加“泛美银行”这一点上并不热心。在讨论到建立“泛美银行”的问题时，美国代表一方面口头上表示“同意”，但是在拉丁美洲国家代表的追问下，却始终不表示美国政府准备投资多少。
    据报道，为了改善对外贸易日趋恶化的情况，拉丁美洲国家代表在会议上还提出了要求美国参与签订稳定主要商品价格以及另一项关于规定咖啡进口限额的建议。美国代表托马斯·曼一方面表示“同情”这些南部邻国的处境，而另一方面他却对萨尔瓦多代表提出的实质上是要美国保证一定数量的咖啡进口作为稳定咖啡的出口和价格的建议不置可否。
    据西方通讯社报道，由于美国在整个会议过程中对帮助拉丁美洲国家克服经济困难没有表现出一点诚意，美国的态度从会议一开始就遭到抨击，会议从开始起一再陷入僵局。巴西代表施密特首先对狄龙的发言表示失望。他说，如果华盛顿不提供三十亿美元的资金来支持巴西总统库比契克提出的“泛美计划”，“它将不得不转而同苏联和共产党中国进行贸易”。他说，这样做虽然“有危险性”，但是，“这比经济停滞的危险要好一些”。据法新社在闭会前从华盛顿发出的消息说，在以后的会议过程中，其他国家代表都依据巴西发言的精神对美国加以抨击，“使美国面临着美洲大家庭发生内部反叛的微妙局势”。
