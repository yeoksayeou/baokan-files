Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: This reporter learned from the artificial rainfall work conference that China's artificial rainfall experiments, conducted in cooperation between scientific workers and the People's Liberation Army Air Force, have been basically successful. This year, Jilin, Gansu, Anhui, Hebei, Hunan, and Hubei provinces have all carried out artificial rainfall (including rainfall and snowfall) work. In some areas, artificial rainfall has been used to overcome drought, which has played a certain role in local agricultural production.

    From August to September this year, Jilin City used airplanes to conduct 22 artificial rainmaking operations, with a success rate of 70% to 80%. The rainfall area reached 20 to 120 square kilometers. The largest rainfall was 25 millimeters, which basically relieved the drought in the suburbs of Jilin City and parts of Yongji, Jiaohe, and Shulan counties, irrigating approximately 40,000 hectares of land. In August, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant units in Gansu Province cooperated to conduct multiple high-altitude and ground-based rainmaking experiments in the Qilian Mountains. Six of the high-altitude experiments were successful. These experiments prove that artificial rainfall in arid areas of the Northwest is not only possible but also very promising and worthy of promotion.

    In addition, scientific workers and the masses in various places have also carried out a lot of research work on artificial melting of ice and snow, artificial cloud dissipation, fog dissipation, and hail suppression, and have achieved results. The Alpine Snow Melting Team of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has achieved a result of melting 500 tons of water per hour per square kilometer of glacier area. Farmers in Lintao County, Gansu Province, and Heqing County, Yunnan Province, have used various indigenous methods on the ground to disperse cloud layers that could cause severe hail disasters.

    This conference was held in Beijing from the 2nd to the 4th, discussed the 1959 plan for promoting artificial rainfall and conducting scientific research on artificial rainfall, cloud dissipation, hail suppression, and fog dissipation, and exchanged experiences from various places.
  This newspaper reports that the experiment of artificial cloud creation was successfully carried out over Nanjing City on November 27. The success of this experiment is the first in the country.

    The cloud creation experiment began at 2:28 pm on the 27th. Seven minutes later, a thin, elongated white cloud belt appeared in the blue sky of Nanjing. A few minutes later, the cloud belt expanded to more than one kilometer wide and more than seven kilometers long, and lasted for 45 minutes. Being able to create cloud layers in the absence of clouds has opened up a new avenue for solving the drought problem. This experiment was conducted under the leadership of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, and was jointly carried out by the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Anhui Provincial Meteorological Bureau, the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Bureau, a unit of the Air Force, and Nanjing University.

    Before and after this experiment, two cloud dissipation experiments were conducted over Nanjing, and both were successful.

    积极推广科学研究成果的一个范例
    人工降水在六个省试验成功
    南京进行人工造云试验，碧蓝长空顷刻出现云层
    新华社5日讯  本社记者从人工降水工作会议上获悉，我国科学工作者和解放军空军部队合作进行的人工降水实验基本上已经成功。今年吉林、甘肃、安徽、河北、湖南、湖北等六省都进行了人工降水（包括降雨和降雪）的工作，有的地区利用人工降水克服旱象，对当地的农业丰产起了一定的作用。
    吉林市在今年8月到9月间，用飞机进行了二十二次人工造雨，成功率达70％到80％；降雨面积达二十到一百二十平方公里；降雨量最大的一次有二十五公厘，基本上解除了吉林市郊和永吉、蛟河、舒兰三县部分地区的旱象，灌溉了约四万公顷的土地。8月间，中国科学院和甘肃省有关单位合作，在祁连山区进行了多次从高空和从地面造雨的试验工作。其中六次高空试验都成功了。这些试验证明，在西北干旱地区进行人工降雨的工作不仅可能，而且希望很大，值得推广。
    此外，在人工融化冰雪、人工消云、消雾、消冰雹等方面，各地科学工作者和群众也都进行了不少研究工作，并且取得了成绩。科学院地球物理研究所组成的高山融雪队，已经取得在每平方公里的冰山面积上每小时化水五百吨的成绩。甘肃省临洮县和云南省鹤庆县的农民群众，曾经在地面上用各种土办法冲散可能造成严重雹灾的云层。
    这个会议在2日到4日在北京举行，讨论了1959年推广人工降水以及进行有关人工降水和消云、消雹、消雾的科学研究工作方案，并且交流了各地已有的经验。
  本报讯  人工造云的试验11月27日在南京市上空获得成功。这一试验的成功在国内是第一次。
    27日下午二时二十八分开始试验造云，过了七分钟，南京的碧空出现了一缕细长的白色云带，又几分钟以后，云带扩展到宽约一公里多，长约七公里多，并一直持续了四十五分钟。能在无云的情况下造出云层，对于解决干旱问题开辟了又一条新的途径。这种试验是在中共安徽省委、江苏省委领导下，由中国科学院地球物理研究所、安徽省气象局、江苏省气象局、空军某部，南京大学等单位协作进行的。
    在这次试验的前后，南京上空进行了两次消云的试验，也都获得了成功。
