Two Principles for Changing the Organizational Form of the Party

Currently, our country has basically achieved the people's commune system. The people's commune is a basic unit of our socialist social structure, integrating workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and also a basic unit of the socialist regime. Due to the establishment of people's communes, a series of tremendous and profound historical changes have been triggered in all aspects of our country, which naturally presents us with the problem of adjusting the original organizational forms and institutions of counties and townships. Organizational forms must be suitable for the situation of struggle and serve political tasks. Therefore, organizational forms are constantly changing with the changes in the situation of struggle and political tasks. If the situation of struggle and political tasks change, but the organizational form remains unchanged, then the old organizational form will inevitably hinder the development of the revolution and construction.

At present, the people's communes have just been established, and many communes are still in their initial stages. Adjustments are being made to the original organizational institutions of counties and townships. Since this is a new thing, everyone lacks experience. How to make the party and government organizational forms of county-level federations of communes and communes suitable for the new situation and tasks is still a new issue that needs to be studied. However, one point is definitely beyond doubt and should not be shaken, that is, during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the change of the party's organizational form must adhere to the principles of being conducive to strengthening the party's leadership and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. It seems that there is no one who openly opposes this principle. However, at present, in adjusting the organizational structure, there are different views and practices on how to strengthen the party's leadership.

According to preliminary understanding, there are roughly three forms of adjustment of the party and government organs of county-level federations of communes and communes in various places: First, the party committee and the commune management committee, the working departments of the party committee and the working departments of the commune are completely merged, or work together in the same office. Only a few adopt this form. Second, some departments of the party committee and the commune with similar business nature are unified, such as merging the rural work department of the county party committee and the agricultural and forestry departments of the county-level federation of communes, or merging the financial and trade department of the county party committee and the financial and trade department of the county-level federation of communes, so that these departments of the commune are directly under the leadership of the party committee. Some departments of the party committee that specialize in party work, such as the propaganda department, the discipline inspection committee, and the organization department, still exist independently and are strengthened. The party committee and the commune management committee are not merged. Third, the original departments of the party committee remain unchanged, or only some minor adjustments have been made, and major adjustments are being prepared; the commune management committee sets up several working departments according to different situations.

The reason for adopting the first form is that after the communization, politics and communes are merged, and the party and communes should also be merged, and the party committee is the commune committee. In this way, the party committee can directly handle all affairs, which is convenient for unifying the party's leadership. Is this understanding and practice correct? The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has already answered: "The fundamental issue in running people's communes well is to strengthen the party's leadership. Only by strengthening the party's leadership can we implement putting politics in command, carry out socialist and communist ideological education among cadres and members in depth, and fight against various erroneous tendencies, and correctly implement the party's line and policies. Some people think that with the commune, the party is no longer needed, and the so-called 'integration of party and commune' can be implemented. This idea is wrong."

Why can politics and communes be merged, but the integration of party and commune is wrong? The integration of politics and communes is the trend of the transformation of the functions of grassroots regimes.

The people's commune has gone beyond the scope of a single agricultural economy and become a unity of economy, culture, and politics. At the same time, militia organizations are established in the production organizations at all levels of the commune, and universal military service is implemented. It is completely unnecessary to set up another administrative agency outside such a good organizational form of the people's commune. The integration of politics and communes is an inevitable trend. This situation had already sprouted before the communization. Some townships and agricultural cooperatives have already merged; the township people's committee handed over some "landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements" to the agricultural cooperatives to supervise production, and the agricultural cooperatives actually performed part of the functions of the regime. Practice has proved that the implementation of the integration of politics and communes and universal military service by the people's communes is not only of great significance to our country's economic construction and national defense construction, but also of great benefit to strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship and strengthening the supervision and transformation of "landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements"; it is not only conducive to strengthening the party's leadership and giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses, but also can reduce institutions and reduce personnel who are divorced from production. We know that although "complex class struggles not only exist seriously abroad, in the capitalist world, but also exist at home," after all, the number of counter-revolutionaries in the country has been greatly reduced, and the state power's function of directly organizing economic construction and cultural construction is gradually increasing. In the future, with the development of the economic and political situation, the task of the regime in managing dictatorship at home will become less and less, and the task of managing economic and cultural undertakings and organizing people's lives will become more and more. Therefore, at the present stage, the people's commune, a social organization that integrates politics and communes and bears dual tasks (mainly responsible for economic and cultural construction, and also has the task of exercising dictatorship over the enemies of socialism), is an organizational form that is suitable for the current trend of the transformation of the functions of grassroots regimes in our country. The integration of party and commune can only weaken the party's leading role. The integration of politics and commune is undoubtedly affirmed. However, the party and commune cannot be integrated. The party is the advanced force of the working class and the highest form of the working class's class organization. The party must lead everything and is also able to lead everything. The party's leadership is the lifeline of all organizations. After communization, various undertakings have developed in an all-round way, requiring a higher degree of unity and planning. This requires that all work of the commune must be absolutely placed under the centralized leadership of the party and must be politically and organizationally under the leadership of the party. The political direction of the party committee and the commune is completely consistent, the task of the party committee is the task of the commune, and all the plans and measures that the party committee requires to be realized are also the plans and measures that the commune should strive to realize. It cannot be said that the party's decision is one thing, and the commune does another thing, completely ignoring the party's decision. In this sense, the party and the commune are inseparable, and there can only be one "political design institute"—the party committee, not two "political design institutes."

However, the unified leadership of the party committee does not mean that the party committee should take care of everything, nor does it mean that the party and commune institutions should be completely merged. The unified leadership of the party must be combined with division of labor and responsibility, and the principle of "the party committee decides, and all parties go to do it" must be implemented. That is to say, major matters are uniformly discussed and decided by the party committee; after the party committee makes a decision, the commune management committee and relevant parties should go to do it separately according to the decision of the party committee and the party's principles; in the process of implementing the decision of the party committee, the party committee has the responsibility of supervision and inspection. If the party committee and the commune management committee are completely merged into one, it will blur the boundaries between the party and non-party members, reduce the level of the party to the level of general mass organizations, and will inevitably force the party committee to deal with a large number of daily and specific economic and administrative affairs, which will affect the party committee's investigation and research on major policy issues and the inspection of the implementation of the party's policies and resolutions, and will inevitably weaken the party committee's political and ideological work, making the party fall into the quagmire of事務主義 [pragmatism/routinism/bureaucratism], resulting in weakening the party's leadership. Obviously, the practice of integrating the party and commune is not allowed by the party's organizational principles, and it is also unworkable in actual work.

So, is the second form good or not? Is this practice the integration of party and commune? The party committee and the commune management committee are not merged, only some departments of the party committee and the relevant departments of the commune are unified, and are under the unified leadership of the party committee, which is not the integration of party and commune. These departments of the party committee, such as the rural work department, the financial and trade department, etc., are the working organs of the party committee, which are set up by the party committee according to the party's political tasks and work needs. Whether these working organs are increased, decreased, strengthened, merged, or abolished can be decided by the party committee in a unified manner, which does not affect the party committee's leading role. At present, after our country has basically achieved victory in the socialist revolution in the economic, political, and ideological fields, in the process of carrying out cultural revolution and technological revolution, and in the main march towards nature, the party committee's leadership over economic and cultural undertakings is becoming more and more specific, and many tasks of the commune need to be directly grasped by the party committee. Therefore, the practice of the commune party committee merging some of its departments with some departments of the commune management committee that have similar business nature, while strengthening some departments that specialize in party work, is suitable for this new situation. The practice in some places has also proved that this is beneficial to a certain extent. It is not only conducive to strengthening the party's unified leadership and twisting the strength of all parties into a rope, but also facilitates the division of labor and responsibility, and better implements the resolutions of the party committee; it not only facilitates the adjustment of cadres and strengthens the departments that need to be strengthened, but also eliminates the phenomenon of mutual buck-passing and waste of power. Therefore, this practice may be the development direction of adjusting the party and commune organizational structure of county-level federations of communes and communes at the present stage.

    政、社可以合一  党、社不可合一

    改变党的组织形式的两个原则
    目前，我国已经基本上实现了人民公社化。人民公社是我国社会主义社会结构的、工农商学兵相结合的基层单位，同时又是社会主义政权的基层单位。由于人民公社的建立，在我国各方面引起了一系列巨大而又深刻的历史性的变化，自然也给我们提出了调整原有县乡的组织形式和组织机构的问题。组织形式必须适合于斗争形势，为政治任务服务。因此组织形式是经常随着斗争形势和政治任务的变化而变化的。如果斗争形势和政治任务变了，组织形式不变，那末旧的组织形式必然会障碍革命和建设事业的发展。
    目前人民公社刚建立不久，许多公社还是初具规模，对于原有的县乡组织机构正在进行调整。由于这是一件新的事情，大家还缺乏经验，如何使县联社、公社的党、政组织形式适合于新的形势和任务，还是一个需要研究的新问题。不过，有一点是肯定无疑，不应该动摇的，这就是，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，党的组织形式的改变，必须坚持有利于加强党的领导，有利于巩固无产阶级专政的原则。看来，公开反对这个原则的人，似乎没有。但是，目前在调整组织机构时，在如何才能加强党的领导问题上，却有着不同的看法和作法。
    根据初步了解，目前各地对县联社、公社党政机构的调整，大体上有三种形式：第一，党委会和公社管理委员会、党委的工作部门和公社的工作部门完全合并，或者合署办公。采取这种形式的只是个别的。第二，把党委和公社有些业务性质相同的部门统一起来，比如把县委的农村工作部和县联社的农林部门，或者把县委的财贸部和县联社的财贸部门合一，使公社的这些部门直接受党委的领导。党委有些专作党的工作的部门，如宣传部、监委会、组织部等，仍单独存在并且加强了。党委会和公社管理委员会没有合一。第三，党委的原有各部门保留不变，或者只作了一些小的调整，正在准备进行较大的调整；公社管委会则根据不同情况设置若干工作部门。
    采取第一种形式的理由，是认为公社化以后政社合一了，党社也应该合一，党委会就是社委会。这样党委可以直接处理一切事务，便于统一党的领导。这种认识和作法是否正确呢？在中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中已经作了答复：“办好人民公社的根本问题是加强党的领导。只有加强党的领导，才能实行政治挂帅，才能在干部和社员中深入地进行社会主义、共产主义的思想教育和反对各种错误倾向的斗争，才能正确地执行党的路线和政策。某些人认为有了公社就可以不要党，就可以实行所谓‘党社合一’，这种想法是错误的”。
    为什么政社可以合一，而党社合一就是错误的呢？政社合一是基层政权职能转化的趋势
    人民公社已经超出了单一的农业经济的范围，而成为经济、文化、政治的统一体，同时在公社的各级生产组织中，也相应地建立民兵组织，实行全民皆兵。在人民公社这样的一个良好的组织形式之外，再另设一套行政机构，是完全没有必要的。政社合一是一个必然的趋势。这种情况，在公社化以前，已有萌芽，有的乡和农业合作社已经合一；乡人民委员会把一些“地富反坏”分子，交给农业社监督生产，农业社实际上执行了政权的一部分职务。实践证明，人民公社实行政社合一和全民皆兵，不仅对我国经济建设和国防建设有重大意义，而且对加强人民民主专政，加强对“地富反坏”分子的监督和改造也有很大的好处；不仅有利于加强党的领导，发挥群众的积极性，而且可以减少机构，减少脱离生产的工作人员。我们知道，虽然“复杂的阶段斗争，不但在国外，在资本主义世界，严重地存在着；就是在国内，也还是存在着”，但是目前国内的反革命分子，毕竟是大大减少了，国家政权对内直接组织经济建设和文化建设的职能是逐渐增多了。今后随着经济、政治形势的发展，政权在国内管理专政方面的任务将越来越少，而管理经济、文化事业和组织人民生活的任务将越来越多。因此，在现阶段，人民公社这种政社合一的、负有两重任务（主要是负责经济文化建设，同时还有对社会主义的敌人实行专政的任务）的社会组织，正是适合于目前我国基层政权职能转化的趋势的组织形式。党社合一只能削弱党的领导作用政社合一是肯定无疑的。但是党社是不能合一的。党是工人阶级的先进部队，是工人阶级的阶级组织的最高形式。党必须领导一切，并且也能够领导一切。党的领导是一切组织的生命线。公社化以后各项事业全面发展，需要有更高的统一性、计划性。这就要求公社的一切工作必须绝对地置于党的一元化的领导之下，必须在政治上组织上受党的领导。党委和公社的政治方向完全是一致的，党委的任务就是公社的任务，党委所要求实现的一切规划和措施，也是公社应该力求实现的规划和措施。不能说党的决定是一回事，公社又另外搞一套，根本不顾党的决定。从这种意义上来讲，党和社是密切不可分的，只能有一个“政治设计院”——党委，不能有两个“政治设计院”。
    但是，党委统一领导，并不是党委要包办一切，也并不等于把党和社的机构完全合并起来。党的统一领导，必须和分工负责相结合，要贯彻“党委决定，各方去办”的原则。也就是说重大事项，统一由党委讨论决定；党委决定以后，公社管理委员会和有关方面，就要根据党委的决定和党的原则分头去办；在贯彻执行党委决定的过程中，党委有督促和检查的责任。如果把党委会与公社管理委员会完全合而为一，就会模糊了党和非党的界限，把党的水平降低到一般群众组织的水平，就必然会迫使党委会去处理大量的日常的具体的经济事务和行政事务，会影响党委去考察研究重大的政策方针问题和检查党的政策决议贯彻执行的情况，也必然会削弱党委的政治思想工作，使党陷于事务主义的泥坑，结果是削弱了党的领导。显然，党社合一的作法是党的组织原则所不允许的，在实际工作中也是行不通的。
    那末，第二种形式究竟好不好呢？这种作法是不是党社合一呢？党委会和社管理委员会没有合一，只是把党委的某些部门和公社的有关部门统一起来，由党委统一领导，并不是党社合一。党委的这些部门，如农村工作部、财贸部等等，是党委的办事机关，是党委根据党的政治任务和工作需要而设置的，这些办事机关是增是减，是加强，是合并，还是撤销，都可以由党委统一决定，而并不影响党委的领导作用。目前，我国在经济上、政治上、思想上的社会主义革命基本上取得胜利以后，在进行文化革命和技术革命的过程中，在主要向自然进军中，党委对经济文化事业的领导是愈来愈具体了，公社的很多工作需要党委直接来抓，所以公社党委把它的某些部门和公社管理委员会的某些业务性质相同的部门合并起来，同时加强一些专作党的工作的部门的作法，是适合这种新的情况的。有些地方的实践也证明这样作是有一定好处的。它既有利于加强党的统一领导，把各方面的力量拧成一股绳，又便于分工负责，更好地贯彻党委的决议；既便于调整干部，加强需要加强的部门，又消除了相互推诿、浪费力量的现象。因此，这种作法可能是现阶段调整县联社、公社党社组织机构的发展方向。
