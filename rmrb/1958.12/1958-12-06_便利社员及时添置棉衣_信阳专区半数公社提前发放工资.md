    Convenient Commune Members to Add Winter Clothing
    Xinyang Prefecture, Half of the Communes Issue Wages in Advance
    (Our Newspaper) According to reports, in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, eighty-seven out of one hundred and sixty-one people's communes issued two or three months' wages in advance in October, solving the problem of winter clothing and bedding for commune members, which was warmly welcomed by the majority of commune members. The remaining seventy-four communes were also able to issue wages on a monthly basis. After the Huoxing People's Commune in ShiliPu Township, Xincai County, issued the wages for October and November in advance on October 1st, commune members bought 10,000 pairs of shoes, and 25,000 people made new clothes. In the past, eighty-four households with more than one hundred and twenty relatively poor commune members wore rags every winter. This year, after receiving their wages, each person added a thick set of new cotton clothes. Due to the bumper harvest of cotton and other cash crops this year, the Hongqi People's Commune in Xinyang County had a large surplus in its total income, in addition to various deductions and distributions to commune members. Besides issuing two months' wages in advance, the commune also spent a sum of money from the surplus to buy cloth and distribute it to commune members. In the past month, more than 49,000 commune members in the commune added 31,483 new cotton clothes and 148 new cotton quilts. The elderly people in the ten happiness homes all wore newly made cotton clothes. In Runan County, all eleven basic people's communes in the county also issued two months' wages in advance in October. According to incomplete statistics, commune members added more than 317,000 new cotton clothes and more than 540,000 new cotton clothes. Kindergartens, nurseries, and happiness homes also made thousands of new cotton clothes.
    The reason why all one hundred and sixty-one people's communes in Xinyang Prefecture can issue wages on time is mainly due to the development of various economic productions. The source of wages in many communes comes from the income from the commodity production of various economies. Starting in October, the 1 million yuan plus salaries of commune members in the eleven basic communes in Runan County can be paid entirely from various economic incomes without relying on agricultural income. In October, the Wanggang People's Commune had an income of more than 200,000 yuan from the processing of cotton and sweet potatoes alone, which was enough for the entire commune to pay more than three months' wages. After developing more than 30 kinds of sideline productions such as starch, bricks, tiles, and livestock in November, the Hongguang People's Commune expects to earn more than 330,000 yuan in one month, which can also pay three months' wages continuously.

    便利社员及时添置棉衣
    信阳专区半数公社提前发放工资
    本报讯  河南省信阳专区一百六十一个人民公社，有八十七个公社在10月份提前发放了两个或三个月的工资，解决了社员过冬棉衣、棉被的添置问题，受到广大社员的热烈欢迎。其余七十四个公社也都能按月发放工资。新蔡县十里铺乡火星人民公社在10月1日提前发放了10、11两个月的工资后，全社社员新买了一万双鞋，有二万五千人做了新衣。过去有八十四户一百二十多个社员比较贫苦，年年过冬都穿得破破烂烂，今年在领到工资后，每人都添了一套厚厚的新棉衣。信阳县红旗人民公社由于今年棉花等经济作物丰收，总收入中除了各项扣除和社员分配的以外，还有大量结余，社里除提前发放两个月工资外，还从结余中支出一笔钱买布发给社员，全社四万九千多个社员，一个月来就新添棉衣三万一千四百八十三件，新添棉被一百四十八床，十个幸福院里的老人，人人都穿上了新做的棉衣。汝南县全县十一个基层人民公社，在10月份也提前发了两个月工资，全县据不完全统计，社员新添棉衣三十一万七千多件，添一面新的棉衣五十四万多件，幼儿园、托儿所、幸福院也新做了几千件棉衣。
    信阳专区一百六十一个人民公社都能按时发放工资，主要是开展了多种经济生产的结果。很多社的工资的来源，都是从多种经济的商品生产收入中开支的。汝南县从10月份开始，全县十一个基层社一百多万元的社员工资，可以不依赖农业收入，完全从多种经济收入中付出。王岗人民公社10月份光棉花、红薯两项加工的收入就有二十多万元，够全社发三个多月的工资。红光人民公社11月份发展淀粉、砖瓦、牲畜等三十多种副业生产后，预计一个月可收入三十三万多元，也可以连续发放三个月工资。
