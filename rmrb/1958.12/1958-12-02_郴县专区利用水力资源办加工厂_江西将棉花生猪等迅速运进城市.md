    Chen County Special Zone Utilizes Hydropower Resources to Run Processing Factories
    Jiangxi Rapidly Transports Cotton, Hogs, etc., into Cities
    (Our Dispatch) To adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, Chen County Special Zone in Hunan Province has recently built 911 hydropower universal processing factories, 237 sweet potato processing factories, 1,674 oil presses, and 66 water mills. It is estimated that by the end of December, the special zone's grand plan for the mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing can be basically realized.
    The realization of agricultural and sideline product processing mechanization is the inevitable result of the unprecedented bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline products this year, the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and the urgent demand of the broad masses. This year, the rice yield in Chen County Special Zone has doubled compared to last year, and the oil tea production has increased by more than double compared to last year. In particular, summer and autumn sweet potatoes, which are on par with rice, are expected to have a total output of over 10 billion jin. Other agricultural and sideline products also require rapid processing. With such a large quantity, if the past processing methods were used, it would take five or six months to process them all. At the same time, in order to better solve the problem of labor shortage, the masses' heavy housework, such as grain processing and pig feed preparation, also requires mechanization to replace it. The Chen County Party Committee pointed out that the only correct path is to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and take the road of technical innovation, that is, to vigorously promote indigenous mechanization. This special zone belongs to a semi-mountainous and semi-hilly area, with small streams and rivers everywhere, rapid currents, and many drops of more than one meter. Many people originally had the habit of using hydropower to hull rice, grind flour, and squeeze oil; after the Chen County Party Committee issued the call to vigorously promote technical innovation and realize the indigenous mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing within one year, Yongxing County built 42 large-scale hydropower automated sweet potato processing factories and 46 universal processing factories in a very short time. Many areas are beginning to transform oil presses and water mills so that the oil presses and water mills can simultaneously carry out several tasks such as oil extraction, rice milling, and flour grinding. The processing capacity is generally very high. The two automatic sweet potato processing factories built by the Dacheng and Youma teams of the Yongxing Red Flag People's Commune and the Five-Star People's Commune can process more than 50,000 jin of sweet potatoes every day. From washing, transporting, grinding, filtering to making starch, all are operated by hydropower. If a rice milling machine is added, it can also process 12,000 jin of rice every day. And the construction of such a factory only requires two to three hundred yuan to more than one thousand yuan of funds.

    郴县专区利用水力资源办加工厂
    江西将棉花生猪等迅速运进城市
    本报讯  湖南省郴县专区为了适应工农业大发展的新形势，最近建成水力万能加工厂九百十一座，红薯加工厂二百三十七座，油榨坊一千六百七十四座，水磨坊六十六座，预计到12月底全专区农副产品加工土机械化的宏伟计划，就可以基本实现。
    实现农副产品加工机械化，是今年农副产品取得空前大丰收，工农业大跃进的必然结果，是全区广大群众的迫切要求。郴县专区今年的稻谷产量比去年增长了一倍，油茶产量比去年增加一倍以上，特别是与稻谷平起平坐的夏、秋红薯，预计总产量将达一百亿斤以上，其他农副产品都要求迅速加工处理。这么大的数量，如果用过去的加工方法，就是花五、六个月时间也加工不完。同时，为了很好地解决劳力紧张问题，群众的口粮加工、猪饲料操作等一系列繁重的家务劳动，也都要求机械化来代替。中共郴县地委指出，唯一正确的道路，是依靠群众、发动群众，走技术革新的道路，即大搞土机械化。这个专区是属于半山区半丘陵区，到处有小溪小河，水流湍急，落差在一公尺以上的很多。不少群众原来就有利用水力来碾米、磨粉、榨油等习惯；当中共郴县地委发出大搞技术革新一年内实现农副产品加工土机械化的号召后，永兴县在很短的时间内，就建成了大型水力自动化红薯加工厂四十二座，万能加工厂四十六座。不少地区正在着手改装油榨坊、水磨坊，使油榨坊、水磨坊同时可以进行榨油、碾米、磨面等好几种工作。加工能力一般都很高。永兴红旗人民公社和五星人民公社的大城、油麻两个队兴建的两个自动化红薯加工厂，每天都能处理五万斤以上的红薯，从洗、运、磨粉、过滤到制成淀粉，全部是水力操作。如果加上碾米机，每天还可以加工一万二千斤谷子。而建成这样一个工厂，只需两三百元到一千多元的资金。
