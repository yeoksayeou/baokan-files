    People's communes must vigorously develop industry. The development of commune industry will not only accelerate the process of national industrialization but also promote the realization of public ownership in rural areas and reduce the gap between cities and the countryside. People's communes should, based on their different conditions, gradually transfer an appropriate number of laborers from agriculture to industry and develop, in a planned way, light and heavy industrial production such as fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural tools and machinery, building materials, processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural products, sugar refining, textiles, papermaking, as well as mining, metallurgy, and electricity. The industrial production of people's communes must be closely integrated with agricultural production, first serving the development of agriculture and the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, while also meeting the daily needs of the commune members, and serving the national large-scale industry and the socialist market.

    人民公社必须大办工业。公社工业的发展不但将加快国家工业化的进程，而且将在农村中促进全民所有制的实现，缩小城市和乡村的差别。应当根据各个人民公社的不同条件，逐步把一个适当数量的劳动力从农业方面转移到工业方面，有计划地发展肥料、农药、农具和农业机械、建筑材料、农产品加工和综合利用、制糖、纺织、造纸以及采矿、冶金、电力等轻重工业生产。人民公社的工业生产，必须同农业生产密切结合，首先为发展农业和实现农业机械化、电气化服务，同时为满足社员日常生活需要服务，又要为国家的大工业和社会主义的市场服务。
