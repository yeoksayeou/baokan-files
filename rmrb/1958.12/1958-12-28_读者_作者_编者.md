    New Party Members Inspire
    The People's Daily’s December 14th front-page article "Ten Million New People Swear to Join the Party" is a very good news piece. It reports that Party organizations in various regions have absorbed a large number of new Party members during the Great Leap Forward, thereby further strengthening the Party's ties with the masses, enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness, and strengthening the Party's leadership. It is also a great encouragement and education to the vast number of activists who are actively applying to join the Party. This news article has a novel title and rich content. I hope to see more reports on Party life in the future, such as how to rectify and strengthen the Party's ranks during the Great Leap Forward, strengthen the communist education of Party members, and how to strengthen the activities of the Party's grassroots organizations.

    Children Write Poems, Guo Lao Responds
    Many Singers in the Heroic Era
    We were very moved after reading "Children's Poems" on December 18th, especially the line "Spurring our horses to catch up with Guo Lao," which invigorated us with the children's ambition and spirit. After reading the editor's note, we thought Guo Lao would definitely respond to the children. Sure enough, Guo Lao's poem met us only one day later. Guo Lao is very humble, claiming "many poems, few good ones," which we disagree with. At the same time, Guo Lao encourages our younger generation to work hard, which is a great inspiration to us. In the short poem, Guo Lao specifically mentions "Learning from Chairman Mao," which has a profound meaning. We should learn from Chairman Mao in writing poetry, and also learn from Guo Lao. Not only should we learn the creative methods of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism, but more importantly, we must also have noble sentiments of the times. In our chat, one comrade said: "Glad to see children composing new songs, every sentence stirs my heart, children write poems, Guo Lao responds, many singers in the heroic era." Our motherland is truly a land of poetry!

    We Must Advance Towards New Goals
    Reading the People's Daily editorial on the 22nd of this month, "Advance Towards New Goals," I felt very excited. While celebrating the victorious completion of the 10.7 million tons of steel plan, we are proud of the great achievements we have made. However, as the editorial points out, there is still a great distance compared to our grand goals, and we have not yet shaken off the "poor and blank" situation. The construction tasks before us are still very arduous. In the coming new year—the second year of the three years of hard struggle—we must redouble our efforts, work hard and skillfully, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward under the leadership of the Party!

     Reply to Opinions on "East Wind Blows Out the Dying Candle"
      (The People's Daily published a cartoon "East Wind Blows Out the Dying Candle" by Comrade Hua Junwu on page five on December 19th. Readers sent letters with their opinions, and we asked Comrade Hua Junwu to reply here.)

    Some readers have raised opinions on the cartoon "East Wind Blows Out the Dying Candle." Comrades, using the habit of looking at maps, believe that the wind direction is from left to right in the picture, which means it is a west wind rather than an east wind. Readers think this is a mistake. My opinion is that looking at a painting is different from looking at a map. There is no need to look at a painting using the method of looking at a map. The reason why maps need to have east, south, west, and north is so that readers can distinguish directions. For a painting, there is no issue of distinguishing directions.

    Even so, I would still like to thank the readers for their concern and kind help regarding the paintings published in the newspaper.  Hua Junwu

    新人入党鼓舞人心
    人民日报12月14日第一版“千万新人宣誓入党”是一篇很好的新闻。它报道了各地党的组织在大跃进中吸收了大量新党员，从而进一步密切了党与群众的联系，增强了党的战斗力，加强了党的领导，对广大积极申请入党的积极分子，也是极大的鼓舞和教育。这篇新闻，标题新颖，内容丰富。希望今后多登些党的生活的报道，如在大跃进中如何整顿和壮大党的队伍，加强对党员的共产主义教育，以及怎样加强党的基层组织活动等。

    孩子写诗郭老和
    英雄时代歌手多
    我们读了12月18日“孩子的诗”后很受感动，尤其读到“快马加鞭赶郭老”之句，都为孩子们的雄心和气魄所振奋。看到编后小语，就想郭老一定要回答孩子们的。果然只隔一天郭老的诗就和我们见面了。郭老很谦虚，自称“诗多好的少”，这是我们不同意的。郭老同时勉励我们年轻一代努力，对我们是极大的鼓舞。在短诗中郭老特别提出“学习毛主席”，有很深刻的意义。我们写诗要向毛主席学习，也向郭老学习。不仅学习革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义相结合的创作方法，更重要的我们也要具有崇高的时代感情。我们在漫谈中，有个同志说：喜见孩子作新歌，句句激动我心窝，孩子写诗郭老和，英雄时代歌手多。我们的祖国，真是诗的国度！

    我们要向新的目标前进
    读到本月22日人民日报社论
  “向新的目标前进”，感到非常振奋。在欢庆一千零七十万吨钢的计划胜利完成时，我们为取得伟大的成绩而自豪，但是正如社论所指出的，同我们远大目标比较起来还有很大距离，我们还没有摆脱“一穷二白”的局面，摆在面前的建设任务还十分艰巨。在即将来临的新的一年——苦战三年的第二年，我们更要鼓足干劲，苦干巧干，在党的领导下，为更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗！

     答复对“东风吹残烛”的
          意见
      （本报12月19日五版刊登了华君武同志画的“东风吹残烛”这幅漫画，读者来信提出意见，我们请华君武同志在此答复。）
    有一部分读者对“东风吹残烛”这幅漫画提出了意见，同志们用看地图的习惯，认为风向从图的左侧向右，意味着这是西风而不是东风，读者们认为这是个错误。我的意见是看一张画和地图是不同的，不必拿看地图的方法来看画，地图之所以要有东南西北是为了读者可以辨别方向，对于一张画就没有辨别方向的问题。
    虽然如此，我还是要谢谢读者们对于报纸上刊登的画的关心和善意的帮助。  华君武
