Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 2nd: The National Private Transportation Work Conference was held in Nanjing from November 17th to 27th. Through discussion and on-site visits, the conference focused on studying how private transportation cooperatives should transition to higher forms and exchanged experiences on technical innovations in wooden sailing ships and port loading and unloading work, clarifying the future development direction of the private transportation industry.

This conference was jointly convened by the Transportation Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Communications of the People's Republic of China, with representatives from relevant departments of the central state organs and all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Representatives from various regions unanimously agreed that since the beginning of this year, under the guidance of the Party Central Committee's policy of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in transportation, and driven by the great leap forward with steel as the key link and the participation of the entire people, a mass transportation upsurge has rapidly swept across the country. Everywhere is bustling with activity, everywhere is like "ants moving Mount Tai," and the momentum and scale are unprecedented. Private transportation tools in various regions have undertaken heavy transportation tasks. According to statistics, there are currently more than 289,000 wooden sailing ships and more than 1.07 million animal-drawn carts nationwide. The transportation tasks completed this year account for more than 70% of the total local water and road transportation volume.

The representatives discussed how the private transportation industry should adapt to the current situation and believed that the transition of transportation cooperatives to higher forms is an inevitable trend under the current situation of the people's commune movement and the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production. Current transportation cooperatives are generally small in organization, weak in strength, have many units, and have many contradictions, which are not conducive to unified allocation and use of forces, are not conducive to large-scale operations, and are not conducive to realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization to rapidly increase transport capacity. Therefore, the private transportation industry must change the current small collective ownership, further change the relations of production, and promote the great development of productive forces.

What form should transportation cooperatives take to transition? How should they transition? After full deliberation and discussion, the representatives believed that, based on the needs of production development and the characteristics of the private transportation industry itself, the vast majority are suitable for transferring into people's communes, and a small number can be transferred into state-owned companies. Since this is a major change in the private transportation industry, the conference required all regions to adopt a positive attitude and transition in a guided, step-by-step, and planned manner. During the transition period, it is necessary to adhere to the mass line, strengthen communist ideological education, and fully mobilize the masses through airing views freely, big debates, and form a mass movement that consciously transitions to higher organizational forms.

This conference also widely exchanged experiences on carrying out technical innovations in private transportation tools. The representatives believed that this is an important issue to change the backward state of the private transportation industry and promote the great development of production. Vigorously carrying out technical innovations is the only way for private transportation to gradually move towards mechanization, and to vigorously carry out technical innovations, it is necessary to put politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, and adhere to the policy of mainly relying on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and self-reliance, opposing the ideas of belittling smallness and indigeneity, simply seeking greatness and foreignness, and relying on the state. The conference proposed that through technical innovations, private transportation tools should achieve the goals of being light, having high load capacity, requiring few people, traveling fast, saving effort, being cheap, and being safe.

    适应形势便于大兵团作战
    运输合作社应向高级形式过渡
    中共中央交通工作部等提出民间运输业发展方向
    新华社南京2日电  全国民间运输工作会议从11月17日到27日在南京市召开。会议通过讨论和现场参观，着重研究了民间运输合作社如何向高级形式过渡的问题，交流了木帆船、港口装卸工作进行技术革命的经验，使民间运输业明确了今后的发展方向。
    这次会议是中共中央交通工作部和中华人民共和国交通部联合召开的，中央国家机关有关部门和全国各省、市、自治区都派有代表参加。各地代表一致认为：今年以来，在党中央提出的全党全民办交通的方针指导下，在以钢为纲、全民大跃进的带动下，全国各地迅速掀起一个群众性的运输高潮，到处是车水马龙，到处是
  “蚂蚁搬泰山”，其声势之大，规模之广，是空前未有的。各地民间运输工具承担了繁重的运输任务，据统计，全国现有二十八万九千多只木帆船和一百零七万多辆人兽力车，今年所完成的运输任务约占地方水运和公路总运量的70％以上。
    代表们讨论了民间运输业如何适应当前形势的问题，认为运输合作社向高级形式过渡，是在当前人民公社运动和全国工农业生产大跃进的形势下的必然发展趋势。现在的运输合作社一般都是组织小、力量弱、单位多、矛盾多，不利于统一调配使用力量，不利于大兵团作战，也不利于实现半机械化和机械化，迅速增加运力。因此，民间运输业必须改变现在的小集体所有制，进一步改变生产关系，促进生产力的大发展。
    运输合作社采取什么样的形式过渡？怎样过渡？代表们在经过充分酝酿和讨论后认为，从发展生产需要和民间运输业本身的特点来看，绝大部分适宜转入人民公社，少数的可以转入国营公司。由于这是一次民间运输业的大变革，因此会议要求各地采取积极的态度，有领导、有步骤、有计划地过渡。在过渡期间，必须坚持贯彻群众路线，加强共产主义思想教育，并通过大鸣大放、大辩论，充分地发动群众，形成一个自觉地向高级组织形式过渡的群众性运动。
    这次会议还广泛地交流了民间运输工具开展技术革命的经验。代表们认为这是改变民间运输业的落后状态，促进生产大发展的重要问题。大搞技术革命，是民间运输逐步走向机械化的必由之路，而要大搞技术革命，就必须政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，并坚持以土为主、土洋结合、自力更生的方针，反对轻小轻土、单纯求大求洋和依赖国家的思想。会议提出要通过技术革命，使民间运输工具达到体轻、载重、人少、行快、省力、便宜、安全。
