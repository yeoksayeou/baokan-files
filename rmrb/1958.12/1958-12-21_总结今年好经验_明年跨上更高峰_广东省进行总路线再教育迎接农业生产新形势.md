Guangdong Province Conducts General Line Re-education to Welcome the New Situation in Agricultural Production

(Our report) Guangdong Province, from cadres to the masses, is further implementing the general line by summarizing this year and planning for next year, vigorously promoting ideological emancipation, and welcoming the new situation of a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture next year.

Guangdong Province achieved an exceptionally large harvest of late rice, with an average yield of 1,100 jin per mu throughout the province. The total annual grain output reached over 70.3 billion jin, with an average yield of 1,654 jin per mu and 1,820 jin of grain per person, including over 1,270 jin of rice. The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee believes that agricultural production has entered a new stage. At the meeting of prefectural Party committee secretaries held in November this year, it put forward a plan for agricultural production next year, requiring a greater increase in grain output under the principle of "less planting, high yield, and more harvesting." At the same time, it calls for vigorously developing diversified economies and running commune industries on a large scale. In terms of diversified economies, the focus is on solving the problems of edible oil and meat. Other economic crops, such as sugarcane, silkworms, jute, ramie, fruits, and vegetables, should strive to improve quality and gradually meet social consumption needs. Large-scale cotton planting and vigorous development of tropical crops are also planned. Considering that the Party members and cadres are extremely prone to being overwhelmed by the great victories in agriculture this year, becoming arrogant and complacent, and are also very likely to stagnate due to insufficient understanding of the new situation in agricultural production and the new principle of "less planting, high yield, and more harvesting," it was decided to conduct general line re-education among Party members and cadres throughout the province by summarizing the achievements and shortcomings of agricultural production in 1958, recalling the development of the situation and changes in people's thinking over the past year, and drawing basic political and ideological experiences from personal experiences. On this basis, next year's production will be planned. In the past month, various localities throughout the province have successively convened expanded cadre meetings attended by cadres at or above the people's commune management district level and cadres at or above the production team level. At the meetings, democracy was fully promoted, and cadres were allowed to freely air their views, debate, and form a new movement of ideological emancipation.

The main gains of the universally held cadre meetings are: enabling the backbone force of the agricultural front from the county level to the production team leader level of the commune to grasp several fundamental political experiences. Everyone deeply realized that putting politics in command, emancipating the mind, and using the spirit of continuous revolution to guide production are the most important guarantees for victory. Among these, the so-called "condition theory," "regional specificity theory," "middle-of-the-road theory," and other strange arguments held by right-leaning conservatives that violate the spirit of the general line must be constantly and thoroughly criticized. If these arguments are not broken, people's thinking cannot move forward, and agricultural production cannot move forward either. At the same time, most of the places with backward work and no leap forward are inseparable from the decline of the revolutionary will of local cadres and the existence of individualism, departmentalism, and even capitalist ideology. Therefore, we must always pay attention to vigorously destroying individualism, departmentalism, and capitalist ideology, and vigorously establish socialist and communist ideology. Secondly, everyone deeply realized that the amount of agricultural increase depends on the degree of implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" summarized by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At the meetings in various places, everyone recognized that cadres at all levels must adhere to the mass line and the realistic and pragmatic style, and adhere to taking competition as the form and big-character posters as the weapon to carry out mass movements on a large scale. In this year, the style of the vast number of cadres taking the lead in labor, planting experimental fields, camping and settling in the fields, and sharing weal and woe with the masses must be greatly promoted in the future. As for some cadres, because they were initially overwhelmed by victory, they were unwilling to patiently persuade the people, adopted some coercive methods, did not care about the lives of the masses, lacked a correct and serious estimate of the achievements and shortcomings of their work, began to foster a tendency to exaggerate, and even falsely reported results, as well as tendencies such as championshipism and formalism, which were repeatedly educated and criticized at cadre meetings in various places. In the discussion of how to carry out production next year, many important ideological problems were also resolved. Many cadres always underestimate future development. For example, at the beginning of this year, many people did not believe in the yield of one or two thousand jin per mu for the first crop, but now that it has been achieved, they cannot help but believe it. However, when they heard that the first crop next year would yield four or five thousand jin, they said it was impossible. Cadres in Qionghai County pointed out that the essence of this skepticism is to be superstitious about the past and not to see the future. They stop their footsteps in 1958 and regard the beginning and prelude of the Great Leap Forward as the peak of the Great Leap Forward. "If you don't have the courage of 10,000 jin now, you won't have the output of 10,000 jin in the future." This is the conclusion drawn by the cadres in Qionghai County from the debate. The "condition theory" will still raise its head as the situation changes. Some cadres in Lufeng County reflected that after Lufeng was assigned to Shantou Prefecture this time, "one is happy and the other is afraid." The happy thing is that the other regions are advanced and have many experiences to learn from; the fearful thing is that their own region is relatively backward and will be a "turtle." After recalling and comparing, this condition theory was criticized. Cadres from Huilai County in the Shantou area pointed out that when the Shantou Prefectural Party Committee held a meeting in July last year to discuss the "grain pass," Huilai County reduced its early crop output last year, with a yield of only 170 jin per mu, and the whole county was short of grain. The cadres attending the meeting did not dare to sit in the designated seats. However, after a year of hard work, the yield of the early crop this year was more than 370 jin per mu, and the yield of the late crop was more than 1,300 jin per mu, and it jumped to the ranks of the advanced. It can be seen that the size of the leap forward depends on people, and the good or bad of objective conditions can be changed. The cadres in Lufeng County also reached this conclusion after debate. For example, the Wukeng Management District of the Jinkeng People's Commune in the county has always been a "third-class area." After the people's commune, it jumped to become an advanced area in running canteens and deep plowing the land. Branch Secretary Yang Qiurong said: "We used to be 'turtles' every time, mainly because our thinking was not emancipated. This time we did better, mainly because we listened to the Party, dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to do." In addition, the more popular idea that the shortage of labor cannot lead to a comprehensive leap forward has been initially resolved at meetings in various places.

At present, all parts of the province must combine with the work of consolidating the people's communes and further implement this movement among the masses. (Attached picture)

### 总结今年好经验  明年跨上更高峰  广东省进行总路线再教育迎接农业生产新形势

    总结今年好经验  明年跨上更高峰
    广东省进行总路线再教育迎接农业生产新形势
    本报讯  广东省全省从干部到群众，正在通过总结今年、规划明年，进一步贯彻总路线，大搞思想解放运动，迎接明年农业全面大跃进的新形势。
    广东省晚稻特大丰收，全省平均亩产一千一百斤，全年合计粮食产量共达七百零三亿斤以上，平均亩产一千六百五十四斤，每人有粮食一千八百二十斤，其中稻谷占一千二百七十多斤。广东省委认为农业生产已经进入新的阶段，在今年11月召开的地委书记会议上，提出了明年农业生产的规划。要求明年粮食产量，在少种、高产、多收方针下有更大的增加。与此同时大搞多种经济和大办公社工业。在多种经济方面着重解决吃油和吃肉的问题，其他如甘蔗、蚕桑、黄麻、苎麻、水果、蔬菜等经济作物，要努力提高质量，逐步满足社会的消费需要。大量试种棉花，大力发展热带作物。鉴于党内和干部极容易因今年农业的巨大胜利冲昏头脑，骄傲自满；同时又极容易由于对农业生产的新形势，以及对少种、高产、多收的新方针认识不足而停滞不前；因此决定在全省党内和干部当中，通过总结1958年农业生产的成绩和缺点，回忆一年来形势发展和人们的思想变化，从切身体验中找出政治上思想上的基本经验，进行总路线再教育，进一步解放思想，在这样的基础上规划明年的生产。在最近的一个月来，全省各地先后召开了有人民公社管理区以上干部和生产队以上干部参加的扩大干部会议，在会议上充分发扬民主，放手让干部进行大鸣大放大辩论，形成了一个新的思想解放运动。
    普遍举行的干部会议的主要收获是：使从县级到公社的生产队长一级的农业战线的骨干队伍掌握了几条最根本的政治经验。大家深刻地体会到，政治挂帅，解放思想，用不断革命的精神来指导生产是取得胜利的最主要的保证。在这当中，违反总路线精神的所谓“条件论”、“地区特殊论”、“中游论”等等右倾保守的人所持的古怪论点，必须不断地彻底地加以批判。不击破这些论点，人们的思想就不能前进一步，农业生产也就不能前进一步。同时，还有少数工作落后、没有跃进的地方，大都是和当地干部革命意志衰退，存在有个人主义、本位主义以至资本主义思想分不开的。因此，必须时刻注意大破个人主义、本位主义和资本主义思想，大立社会主义和共产主义思想。其次，大家深刻地体会到，农业增产的多少，取决于贯彻执行党中央和毛主席所概括出来的“八字宪法”的程度。在各地会议上大家都认识到各级干部必须坚持走群众路线和实事求是的作风，坚持以竞赛为形式，以大字报为武器来大搞群众运动。在这一年当中广大干部带头劳动，种试验田，在田头安营扎寨，同群众同甘共苦的作风，今后必须大大发扬。至于有一些干部由于开始为胜利冲昏头脑，对人民群众不愿意耐心地进行说服，采取一些强迫命令的做法，不关心群众的生活，对工作成绩和缺点缺乏正确严肃的估计，开始滋长浮夸倾向，甚至谎报成绩，以及锦标主义、形式主义等倾向，在各地的干部会议上都反复地进行了教育和批判。在明年生产怎样搞的讨论中，也解决了不少重要的思想问题。不少干部对未来的发展总是估计不足。如今年初，对于一造亩产一两千斤，不少人是不相信的，现在实现了，不能不相信了，但一听说明年一造要搞四、五千斤，他们又说是不可能。琼海县的干部指出：这种怀疑论的实质，就是迷信过去，看不见将来。他们把自己的脚步停留在1958年，把大跃进的开端、序幕当做了大跃进的顶点。“现在没有万斤的胆，将来就没有万斤的产”，这是琼海县的干部从辩论中得出的结论。“条件论”在情况变动中仍然会抬头。陆丰县有些干部反映，这次陆丰划归汕头专区以后，“一则以喜，一则以惧”。喜的是人家地区先进，有不少经验可以学习；惧的是自己地区相对落后，会当“乌龟”。经过回忆、对比，这种条件论受到了批判。汕头地区的惠来县的干部指出，去年7月汕头地委召开会议讨论“粮食过关”问题时，惠来县因去年早造减产，亩产只有一百七十斤，全县闹缺粮，参加会议的干部不敢在指定的座位就坐，可是经过一年奋战，今年早造亩产三百七十多斤，晚造亩产一千三百多斤，一跃而挤于先进行列。可见，跃进的大小取决于人，而客观条件的好坏是可以改变的。陆丰县的干部经过辩论后也获得了这样的结论。如该县金坑人民公社乌坑管理区，向来是个“三类地区”，人民公社化后，在办食堂和深翻土地中，一跃而成为先进地区。支部书记杨秋荣说：“我们过去次次当‘乌龟’，主要是思想没解放；这次搞得比较好，主要是听党的话，敢想敢说又敢做。”此外，比较流行的认为劳动力紧张不能全面跃进的思想问题，在各地会议上都初步地获得解决。
    目前，全省各地还要结合巩固人民公社的工作，把这个运动进一步贯彻到群众中去。（附图片）
