    Program for Advancing Towards Communism
    The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan ⑥
    Looking at the Vast Territory, Construction Projects Spread Everywhere
    This is a map showing the distribution of the vast projects that the Soviet people will build in the next seven years. Look, in the vast land of the Soviet Union, how many huge new projects will be built in seven years! How can the heroic pace of the Soviet people advancing towards communism not arouse the cheers of the socialist camp and all progressive mankind!
    During the seven years, the Soviet state's investment in basic construction will almost equal the total investment in basic construction of the national economy in the years since the establishment of the Soviet regime. That is to say, seven years is equal to forty-one years. In seven years, the total industrial output value will increase by 80%. People know that every 1% increase in the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union in 1959 is equivalent to 11 billion rubles, and by 1965, it will increase to about 19 billion rubles. From this, we can also see the Soviet Union's strong and rapidly developing economic strength.
    The Seven-Year Plan shows that the Soviet state has entered a new stage of development—a stage of fully developing communist construction. The main task of this period is to build the material and technical foundation of communism, that is, to further improve all economic sectors on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, to realize Lenin's ideal of complete national electrification, and to absorb new and rich resources into economic circulation. Starting from this principle, the Soviet Union decided to build new enterprises in places where huge resources have been discovered, first of all to develop mineral deposits and produce electricity. Therefore, in terms of the construction of enterprises, the eastward development situation is obvious, because the east is richest in resources and the mining conditions are most favorable. The Soviet people are doing this, which can obviously improve social labor productivity and expand products more quickly, so they can win time in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism and quickly complete the basic economic task of the Soviet people—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in terms of per capita production level.

    向共产主义迈进的纲领
    苏联的七年计划⑥
    看辽阔疆土  建设工程遍布
    这是苏联人民将在未来七年之中兴建的巨大工程分布地区图。请看，在苏联辽阔的土地上，七年之间就要兴建多少巨大的新工程！苏联人民向共产主义前进的这种豪迈步伐，怎能不引起社会主义阵营和全世界进步人类的欢呼呢！
    七年期间，苏联国家基本建设投资额，几乎等于苏维埃政权建立以来历年国民经济基本建设投资额的总和，也就是说，七年等于四十一年。七年之间，工业总产值要增加80％。人们知道，苏联工业总产值在1959年每增加1％就等于一百一十亿卢布，到1965年，则更要增为一百九十亿卢布左右。从这里我们也可以看出苏联的雄厚的、迅速发展的经济实力。
    七年计划表明苏维埃国家已进入了一个新的发展时期——全力展开共产主义建设的时期。这个时期的主要任务是建设共产主义的物质技术基础，也就是说，要在优先发展重工业的基础上进一步提高所有经济部门，实现列宁关于国家全盘电气化的理想，把新的丰富资源吸收到经济周转中来。从这个原则出发，苏联就决定在发现了巨大资源的地方兴建新企业，首先是开发矿藏和生产电力。因此，在企业的兴建方面，就明显地可以看出向东发展的情况，因为东部资源最富、开采条件也最有利。苏联人民这样做，显然可以提高社会劳动生产率、更快地扩大产品，因此，也就可以在同资本主义进行和平经济竞赛中赢得时间，迅速完成苏联人民的基本经济任务——在按人口平均的生产水平上赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家美国。（附图片）
