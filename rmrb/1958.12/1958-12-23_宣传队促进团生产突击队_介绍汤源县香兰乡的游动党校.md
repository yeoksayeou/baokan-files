Propaganda Teams, Promotion Groups, Production Shock Brigades
Introducing the Mobile Party School of Xianglan Township, Tangyuan County
Propaganda Department of the Hejiang District Committee

At the Black Dragon River Province's Exhibition of Universal Theoretical Study, the experience of the Xianglan Township Party Committee School of Tangyuan County particularly attracted representatives from various locations. This is a mobile party school that combines "study, work, and labor," with half a day of study and half a day of labor. They go where things are advanced to learn; they go where things are backward to promote. It is simultaneously a party school, a propaganda team, a promotion group, and a production shock brigade. They study theory and Party policies in production labor, and immediately apply theory to promote production and work, thereby improving their ideological and work levels.

This party school was established after multiple ideological struggles, breaking down "condition theory," "formalism," and various "superstitious notions." The situation of the Great Leap Forward required the township's work to keep up quickly, but at the time, some Party members in Xianglan Township still had serious right-leaning conservative ideas, preventing the Party's intentions from being well implemented. The Xianglan Township Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to quickly improve the level of Party members to promote the leap forward in various tasks. In early spring, the method of monthly centralized study for Party members was adopted, but the time was too short and did not solve the problem much. Later, it was changed to weekly centralized study, with temporary centralized study when there were major political tasks, but when work was busy, this form of study became a meeting for arranging work, and it was impossible to improve the level of Party members theoretically. So, how should the party school be run? A debate unfolded in the Party Committee Standing Committee meeting. Some people opposed running a party school to production, believing that drawing Party members out to study would affect the Great Leap Forward in production; some believed that the township had no theoretical teachers, no complete teaching materials, no school buildings, and no conditions for running a party school. Others believed that starting from the actual situation of the township, relying on the entire Party and the masses, a party school could be run. Party school teachers could be composed of Party Committee leading cadres, stronger Party branch secretaries, and students with firm stances and a relatively strong foundation; teaching materials could be explained based on the current situation and the Party's central work, instructions from higher levels, the general line of socialist construction, and the Party Constitution. They also calculated this: If they walked on one leg, relying entirely on the county party school for training, it would take more than three years to train all the township's Party member cadres once, which could not meet the actual needs. Just then, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Boli County to promote the experience of the Jixing Township's Quanle Red and Expert School, which further encouraged Xianglan Township's confidence in running a party school. "Condition theory" and "superstitious notions" were broken, and they determined the guiding principle for running the party school: starting from the objective situation, serving production, serving politics, and teaching in connection with the actual thoughts of the students, with the aim of raising Party members' awareness, transforming their thinking, and promoting production and work.

Thus, the Xianglan Township Mobile Party School opened on August 17th, with the first class training twenty-six students, graduating on September 1st. From the beginning, the party school's teaching was closely integrated with production tasks and the political situation. At that time, the entire township had concentrated 70% of its labor force on the plains construction site to build water conservancy projects. The work sections were dispersed in seven locations, with weak leadership. The task, originally planned to be completed in twenty-five days, had only completed one-tenth after twenty days of work. The Party Committee decided to move the party school to the most backward Red Star work section to promote progress, studying for half a day, laboring for half a day, and living with the masses. The students first debated the importance of water conservancy construction for developing production and implementing the general line, and criticized erroneous thoughts such as "the Northeast is not afraid of drought, no need to build water conservancy." Once the students' thinking was clear and their enthusiasm was boosted, they deeply investigated the reasons for the slow progress of the project during water conservancy labor. The main reasons were poor political and ideological work, lack of confidence from the leadership, and the masses' fear of delaying the autumn harvest and affecting dividends, resulting in lax labor discipline. In the most serious case, sixteen commune members feigned illness and did not work in a single day, resulting in very low labor efficiency. The party school decided to start with political and ideological work, and in conjunction with the political situation of opposing American and British aggression in the Middle East at the time, conduct internationalism and class education for the commune members. They launched a vigorous propaganda campaign on the construction site using various forms such as small report meetings, debate meetings, big-character posters, and blackboards, raising the commune members' awareness and unanimously expressing their desire to ensure the early completion of the project and oppose American and British aggression. The party school also helped the masses study measures to complete the task, improve soil transportation methods, and work in shifts day and night without resting people or vehicles. In just five or six days, the backward situation of the Red Star construction site was reversed, and the project progress jumped from sixth to third place.

After promoting the backward work section, the party school went to the three more advanced work sections of Riju, Shuanghe, and Shuangquan to learn and summarize experiences. Some students once thought that "advanced work teams are just advanced, there's nothing to do." After the debate, everyone realized that things are not static, they are constantly developing and changing, and even advanced construction sites have backward aspects, and leadership work should not only focus on weak links, but also on leading the backward with the advanced. After summarizing the experience at the construction sites, they decided to focus on various types of labor models, cultivate pace-setters, and increase quotas. For example, they helped Wang Shaoting of the Riju construction site improve his operating methods and double his soil excavation quota, and helped a woman from the Shuanghe construction site increase her excavation from three cubic meters to eight cubic meters. In this way, the leadership had a solid understanding, held on-site meetings, promoted new production methods, and labor efficiency was greatly improved.

The training method of combining labor, work, and study simultaneously strengthened the Party spirit of the students. When they studied the Party Constitution again regarding the issue of wholeheartedly serving the people, some Party members automatically examined their erroneous thoughts of lacking political responsibility, such as wanting to "resign their positions," "requesting to change shoulders," and "fearing fatigue." Party member Gong Yunhe criticized himself in a large meeting for forgetting his roots, seeking comfort, secretly going up the mountain to work for a winter without the Party Committee's knowledge, and not participating in Party life for a year, among other serious mistakes. On the eve of graduation, he happily accepted the arduous task of mining in Shuangyashan. Female Party member Cui Lifen had not participated in labor or work for a long time. After being mobilized three times by the secretary, she came to the party school. But half a month of study and labor raised her awareness. She excitedly examined herself for forgetting her roots like Liu Jiumei, and expressed her determination to make contributions on the construction site and lead the women's labor force in the Riju work team to increase from five to twenty-five, and was named the "Mu Guiying Team" of the entire construction site.

Before the party school graduation, they debated "why all work must put politics in command and must follow the mass line," using the example of the Red Star work team changing from backward to advanced. Student Xin Chengwen recalled the gains of these fifteen days of study, saying: "We not only participated in labor and work, but more importantly, we learned how to go deep into the masses to do ideological work." Yuan Zhongqing said: "This time, I truly understand the meaning of politics as the soul."

Currently, 90% of the party school's twenty-six students have taken on leadership roles in production work, twenty have become production pace-setters, and 80% have become theoretical teachers in Red and Expert Schools.

    宣传队  促进团  生产突击队
    介绍汤源县香兰乡的游动党校
    合江地委宣传部
    在黑龙江全民学理论展览会上，汤源县香兰乡委党校的经验特别吸引着各地来参观的代表。这是一所“学习、工作、劳动”三结合，半日学习，半日劳动的游动性党校。哪里先进就到哪里去学习；哪里落后就到哪里去促进。它既是党校，又是宣传队、促进团，还是生产突击队。他们在生产劳动中学理论、学党的方针政策，立即又运用理论推动生产、工作，同时提高了思想和工作水平。
    这所党校是在多次思想斗争，破除了“条件论”、“正规论”及种种“迷信观念”以后办起来的。大跃进的形势要求乡里的工作很快跟上去，但当时香兰乡的部分党员却还存在严重的右倾保守思想，使党的意图不能很好贯彻下去。中共香兰乡党委决定尽快提高党员水平来推动各项工作跃进。春初，采用了每月党员集中学习一次的办法，但时间太短，不大解决问题。以后又改为每周集中学习一次，遇有重大政治任务临时集中学习，可是工作一忙，这种学习形式又变成布置工作的会议，根本不能从理论上提高党员的水平。于是，究竟应当怎样办党校呢？在党委常委会上展开了一场论争。有的人把办党校和生产对立起来，认为党员抽出来学习会影响生产大跃进；有的认为乡里没有理论教员，没有成套教材，没有校舍，没条件办党校。另一些人却认为从乡的实际情况出发依靠全党、依靠群众可以办党校，党校教员可以由党委领导干部、较强的党支书同立场坚定较有基础的学员担任；教材可以根据当前形势和党的中心工作、上级指示、社会主义建设总路线、党章等进行讲解。他们还算了这样一笔账：假如一条腿走路，完全依靠县委党校培训，那就要三年多时间才能把全乡党员干部轮训一次，不能满足实际需要。正好省委在勃利县召开现场会议推广吉兴乡办的全乐红专学校经验，这就更鼓舞了香兰乡办党校的信心。“条件论”、“迷信观念”破除了，他们确定了办党校的方针：从客观形势出发，为生产服务，为政治服务，联系学员思想实际进行教学，目的在于提高党员觉悟、改造思想并推动生产、工作。
    就这样，香兰乡游动党校在8月17日开学了，第一期培训学员二十六名，9月1日结业。党校教学一开始就紧密与生产任务和政治形势结合起来。那时全乡正集中了70％的劳动力在平原工地兴修水利。工段分散在七处，领导力量薄弱，原计划二十五天完成的任务，开工二十天才完成十分之一。党委决定把党校搬到最落后的红星工段去促进，半日学习，半日劳动，和群众生活在一起。学员先辩论了兴修水利对发展生产和贯彻总路线的重要意义，批判了“东北不怕干，不用修水利”等错误思想。学员的思想明确了，劲头鼓起来，就在修水利劳动中深入地摸清工程进展迟缓的原因，主要是政治思想工作差，领导缺乏信心，群众怕耽误秋收，影响分红，因此劳动纪律松弛，最严重时，一天有十六名社员装病不出工，劳动效率很低。党校决定从政治思想工作着手，结合当时反对美英侵略中东的政治形势对社员们进行一次国际主义和阶级教育。他们在工地上运用小型报告会、辩论会、大字报、黑板报等各种形式展开轰轰烈烈的宣传活动，提高了社员的觉悟，一致表示要保证提前完成工程任务，反对美英侵略。党校又帮助群众研究完成任务的措施，改进运土方法，歇人不歇车昼夜轮番干等，仅仅五、六天时间，就把红星工地落后面貌扭转过来，工程进度由第六位跃为第三位。
    促进了落后工段后，党校又分头到日久、双合、双全三个较先进的工段去学习、总结经验。曾经有些学员认为“先进工队就是先进，没啥工作可做”。辩论后，大家认识到事物不是静止的，随时都在发展变化，先进工地同样有落后面，而且领导工作不仅抓薄弱环节，也要抓先进带动落后。他们到工地总结了经验后，决定抓各类劳动力典型，培养标兵，提高定额。如帮助日久工地王绍廷改进操作方法提高挖土定额一倍，帮双合工地的一位妇女由挖土三立方公尺提高到八立方公尺。这样，领导心里有了底，召开现场会，推行新的生产方法，劳动效率就大大提高。
    劳动、工作、学习三结合的培训方法同时增强了学员的党性。当他们再学习党章关于全心全意为人民群众服务的问题时，有的党员就自动检查了曾想“脱袍让位”、“要求换肩”、“怕累”等缺乏政治责任心的错误思想。党员宫运和在大会上批判自己忘了本，贪图安逸，背着党委偷偷上山干了一冬活，一年不过组织生活等严重错误。毕业前夕他愉快地接受了到双鸭山开矿的艰巨任务。女党员崔莉芬过去长期不参加劳动、不做工作，经书记三次动员才来党校。但半个月的学习、劳动提高了她的觉悟，她激动地检查自己像刘介梅一样忘了本，表示决心要在工地上立功，带动日久工队妇女劳力由五名增加到二十五名，被评为全工地的“穆桂英队”。
    党校结业前夕，又以红星工队由落后变先进为例辩论了“为啥一切工作必须政治挂帅，必须走群众路线”。学员辛成文回忆这十五天学习的收获说：“我们不仅参加了劳动和工作，更重要的是学会了如何深入群众做思想工作。”袁中庆说：“这回才算真正体会到政治是灵魂的意义。”
    现在，党校的二十六名学员有90％担任了领导生产工作，有二十名当了生产标兵，80％担任了红专学校的理论教员。
