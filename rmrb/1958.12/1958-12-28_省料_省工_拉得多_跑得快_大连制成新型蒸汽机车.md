Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, December 27th: A new type of freight steam locomotive has been manufactured at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory.

　　This Model 150 large locomotive is named "Red Flag." Compared with China's existing "Peace" Model 151 locomotive, which has reached international standards, it reduces metal consumption by 28.3%, reduces processing man-hours by 30%, increases traction by 7%, and increases speed by more than 12% per hour. The locomotive has a tall body, simplified structure, and is easy to operate. The Ministry of Railways has decided to designate this locomotive as the standard model for locomotive production next year and organize mass production.

　　The "Red Flag" locomotive is the result of a vigorous mass movement under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Railways and the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee. Not only cadres, technicians, and all workers in the main workshops of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory participated in the design, but also the forces of relevant locomotive manufacturing, usage, and scientific research departments across the country were concentrated. Everyone put forward nearly 50,000 suggestions for improving locomotive design based on the current locomotive manufacturing capabilities, sources of metal materials, and the increasing demands for the quantity and efficiency of locomotives in our country. The Ministry of Railways and the Party Committee of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory collected these opinions and submitted them to worker groups, work sections, workshops, and the entire factory for debate at each level, deciding whether to adopt them or not. They were then analyzed, sorted, and appraised by representatives from design, manufacturing, usage, and scientific research departments to improve them, forming a complete plan for modifying the locomotive design. Many components that were modified were made smaller, lighter, simpler, and welding replaced riveting, while ensuring efficiency. For example, the drivers suggested that the driver's cab be changed from a steel structure to a steel-framed wooden structure, which saved a large amount of steel plate and could also prevent cold and heat. The manufacturing department suggested canceling the underframe on the tender and allowing the tank's pressure to be borne by its own steel plates, which could save 30 tons of steel and a large amount of processing capacity per vehicle. With the cooperation of all parties, the opinions put forward by the masses and various difficult problems encountered in manufacturing were quickly resolved, so that the entire trial production process of the locomotive took only one and a half months, which was nearly four times faster than the usual speed of trial-producing new locomotives.

　　Due to the simple structure of the "Red Flag" locomotive, dozens of locomotive repair and assembly plants across the country will be able to move more easily towards locomotive manufacturing plants next year, meeting the railway transportation industry's demand for the quantity of locomotives. Due to its high efficiency, it also provides good technical conditions for railway employees to carry out the movement of hauling more and running faster.

### 省料  省工  拉得多  跑得快  大连制成新型蒸汽机车

    大连制成新型蒸汽机车
    新华社旅大27日电  一辆新型的货运蒸汽机车在大连机车车辆厂制成。
    这辆一五○型大机车被命名为“红旗”。它比我国现有的达到国际水平的“和平”一五一型机车，金属消耗量减少了28.3％，加工工时减少了30％，牵引力增大了7％，速度每小时提高了12％以上；机车的车体高大，结构简化，驾驶方便。铁道部已经决定将这种机车定为明年机车生产的标准型号，组织大批生产。
    “红旗”型机车是在铁道部和中共旅大市委直接领导下大搞群众运动的成果。参加设计的不仅有大连机车车辆厂的干部、技术人员和主要车间的全体工人，同时还集中了全国有关机车制造、使用和科学研究部门的力量。大家根据当前我国机车制造能力、金属材料来源和对机车的数量和效能的要求日益提高等情况，对改进机车设计提出了近五万条意见。铁道部和大连机车车辆厂党委把这些意见集中起来，交由工人小组、工段、车间和全厂逐级辩论，决定采纳与否，又经过设计、制造、使用和科学研究等部门的代表分析整理鉴定，加以提高，形成一个完善的修改机车设计的方案。经过修改后的许多部件，都在保证效能的条件下，变大为小、变重为轻、变繁为简、变铆为焊。例如司机们提出的司机室由钢结构改为钢骨木结构，就节省了大量钢板，还能防冷防热；制造部门提出取消煤水车上的底架，水柜的压力由它本身的钢板来承受，每台车就可节省三十吨钢材和大量的加工能力。在各方面协商合作下，群众提出的意见和制造中遇到的各种疑难问题，都得到迅速解决，使机车的整个试制过程仅用了一个半月，比往常试制新机车的速度快了近四倍。
    由于“红旗”型机车的结构简单，使全国数十个机车修配厂明年就能比较容易地向机车制造厂迈进，满足铁路运输业对机车数量的要求。由于它的效能高，也为铁路员工开展多拉快跑运动提供了良好的技术条件。
