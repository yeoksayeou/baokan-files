    Revolutionary Technology, Intensive Stocking and Careful Management
    Hongze Lake's Fish and Shrimp Production More Than Doubles
    (Reported by our newspaper) Hongze County, Jiangsu Province, developed a spirit of originality, broke with convention, and, based on the life and growth characteristics of fish, boldly innovated fish farming techniques. It adopted four major measures to increase production, including "no dikes," "amnesty," "intensive stocking," and reform of fishing gear, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of fish this year.
    This year, Hongze County has already caught and is still catching over 160 million catties of fish and shrimp, more than two and a half times the highest annual output of 45 million catties in 1957. Hongze Lake, which had never produced fish fry before, also caught 4 billion fry this year. This output greatly exceeds the total output of fish fry in the Yangtze River within Jiangsu Province this year. There are four original experiences behind this great harvest in fishery production. These are: First, vigorously develop "no-dike" fish farms. This is an extremely bold revolution. Fishermen have grasped a law of fish activity from years of fishing production practice: where there is a lot of aquatic grass, there are a lot of fish, as the saying goes, "People rely on clothes, fish rely on grass, shade in summer, warmth in winter." Therefore, this year they designated all water areas where aquatic grass grows as prohibited fishing areas. During the period of prohibition, large numbers of fish gathered in the deep aquatic grass. When a certain period arrived, fishing was opened, and the entire lake acted in unison. This bold and original new type of fish farm saves labor, money, and feed. The "no-dike" fish farms established throughout the lake this year occupy a total water area of ​​400,000 mu. The average yield per mu can reach more than 300 catties. Xuefeng Commune caught 1,353 catties of fish in one go in a "no-dike" fish farm of 1.8 mu. Second, "amnesty" for snakehead fish. Because snakehead fish eat small fish, some people in the past advocated eliminating all snakehead fish in Hongze Lake. This year, Hongze Lake fishermen completely overturned this proposition from their production practice. The fishermen listed five major advantages of snakehead fish: (1) strong adaptability and high survival rate; (2) tender and delicious meat; (3) fast growth. Snakehead fish fry grows three inches in a month and about three catties in a year; (4) the skin can be processed into leather; (5) sells well overseas. Therefore, a method of "amnesty" for snakehead fish was adopted, and snakehead fish stocking was vigorously carried out. In order to prevent snakehead fish from eating other fish, new measures of "special pond stocking, stocking large and small fish in separate ponds" were implemented, with good results. Third, intensive stocking and careful management. This is an important key to high yield. The method is "layered stocking, three-dimensional utilization of the water surface," that is, stocking both upper-layer fish and bottom-layer fish in the same fish pond. Fourth, vigorously carry out technical revolution of fishing gear. In the past, Hongze Lake fishermen mostly used small nets, small cards and other backward tools for production, which were useless in the deep water of the lake center, and the output was very low. This year, more than 40 new types of fishing gear have been created, basically realizing hook and net production. More than half of the people have initially mastered the operation process of fish fry production.
    This year's unprecedented bumper harvest of fish has completely changed the poor and backward face of Hongze Lake. More than 5,000 fishing families have achieved permanent residence on land, everyone is wearing warm cotton clothes, and the fishermen have composed a folk song to praise the new life of the people of Hongze Lake: "Rice and white flour are year-round grain, new boats and new houses are the hometown,洋布卡其 [transliteration, meaning foreign cloth and khaki] are worn, children can also go to school, Hong Lake has changed from now on, thanks to benefactor the Communist Party."
    Now, Hongze Lake is in the peak season of fish production. While 170,000 people are discussing the county party committee's plan for a great leap forward in aquatic products next year, they are working day and night on the lake. They are determined to make a greater leap forward in aquatic products in 1959. They want to vigorously cultivate aquatic grass in the lake and expand "no-dike" fish farms; combine with the winter and spring river network project to build all low-lying fields into fish ponds; establish fish fry and fish seed ponds in every commune, and vigorously carry out fish fry and fish seed breeding work. In addition, they also plan to increase the intensive stocking volume to 100,000 fish per mu and vigorously carry out fish gear reform, and realize the mechanization and sail-powering of fishing boats as soon as possible.

    革新技术  密放精养
    洪泽湖增产鱼虾两倍半
    本报讯  江苏洪泽县发扬独创精神，打破常规，根据鱼类生活生长特性，大胆革新养鱼技术，采取“无堤”、“大赦”、“密放”和鱼具改革等四大增产措施，使今年鱼产获得空前大丰收。
    洪泽县今年已经捕捞起和正在捕捞的鱼虾，有一亿六千多万斤，与历史上最高年产量1957年的四千五百万斤比较，增了两倍半。从未生产过鱼苗的洪泽湖，今年也捕捞了四十亿尾。这个产量，大大超过了江苏境内长江今年鱼苗的总产量。这里获得渔业生产大丰收，有四条独创的经验。这就是：第一，大搞“无堤防”养鱼场。这是一项极其大胆的革命。渔民们从多年捕捞生产实践中，掌握了鱼类活动的一条规律：水草多处鱼群多，俗说“人靠衣裳鱼靠草，夏乘阴凉寒当袄”，因此，今年他们把生长水草的水面，一律划为禁捕区，禁捕期间，鱼群大批汇集在水草深处，到一定的时期，开禁捕鱼，全湖一齐行动。这种大胆独创的新型养鱼场，省工、省钱、省饲料，全湖今年搞的无堤防养鱼场，共占水面四十万亩。平均亩产可达三百多斤，雪枫公社在一亩八分大的“无堤防”养鱼场内，一次就捕了一千三百五十三斤鱼。第二，“大赦”黑鱼。因为黑鱼会吃小鱼，过去，有些人主张将洪泽湖里的黑鱼全部消灭。今年，洪泽湖渔民从生产实践中，彻底推翻了这个主张，渔民们列举出黑鱼的五大优点：（1）适应性强，成活率高；（2）肉细嫩、味美；（3）生长快，黑鱼苗一个月长三寸，一年长有三斤左右；（4）皮可加工制成皮革；（5）畅销海外。因此，采取了“大赦”黑鱼的办法，大搞黑鱼放养。为了防止黑鱼吃鱼，实行“专塘放养，大小分塘放养”的新措施，效果良好，第三，密放精养。这是高产的重要关键。办法是“分层放养，立体利用水面”。即在一个鱼塘里，既放上层鱼，又放底层鱼。第四，大搞鱼具的技术革命。洪泽湖渔民过去大都用小网、小卡等落后工具来生产，湖心深水不管用，而且产量很低。今年创造了新式鱼具四十多种，基本上实现了钩网化。有半数以上的人，初步掌握鱼苗生产的操作过程。
    今年的鱼产空前大丰收，彻底改变了洪泽湖贫穷落后的面貌。五千多户渔民，实现了陆上定居，人人穿上暖和的棉衣，渔民们编了一首歌谣来歌颂洪泽湖人民的新生活：“大米白面常年粮，新船新房是家乡，洋布卡其穿上身，儿童也能上学堂，洪湖从此变了样，感谢恩人共产党”。
    现在，洪泽湖正值鱼产旺季，十七万人民在讨论县委明年水产大跃进规划的同时，日夜在湖上大战。他们决心叫1959年的水产来个更大跃进，他们要在湖里大力培植水草，扩大“无堤防”养鱼场；结合冬春河网化工程，将低洼田全部建成养鱼塘；社社建立鱼苗鱼种塘，大搞鱼苗鱼种繁殖工作。此外还准备将每亩密放量提高到十万尾和大搞鱼具改革，尽快实现鱼船机帆化。  （严锋明）
