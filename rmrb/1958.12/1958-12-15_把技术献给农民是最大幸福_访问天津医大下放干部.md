Dedicating Technology to Farmers is the Greatest Happiness
—A Visit to Transferred Cadres from Tianjin Medical University
By Our Correspondent Zhang Yinghua

Last November, Tianjin Medical University transferred over a hundred faculty members and medical staff from affiliated hospitals to the Xiaozhan People's Commune (formerly Daan Agricultural Cooperative) in the suburbs of Tianjin for labor training. Recently, I visited them and found them on the threshing ground harvesting the bountiful Xiaozhan rice alongside veteran cooperative members. When most of them were transferred last year, they believed that there would be no reference books or laboratories in the countryside, which would waste their expertise, so their morale was low. What do they think now? Zhu Bihe, the leader of the transferred cadre team, showed me some laboratory tools in a small room: glass test tubes, medicine bottles, and then told me about the following incident: This spring, when the rice seedlings cultivated in the seedbeds on land and water had grown to an inch high, there was a drought and water shortage. The only water source, the Machang River, had dried up, threatening the rice seedlings, and people were very anxious. At this moment, water suddenly came into the river, but its color was abnormal, it was black. Could this water be used? The transferred cadres tested it and found that the salt content in the water reached 2% to 4%, which was not suitable for use in the rice fields. They reported this situation to the district committee, which notified all townships to stop using this water for irrigation. Later, most of the rice seedlings that had been irrigated with this water were damaged, but most of the rice seedlings on both sides of the river were saved. Their testing work was praised by the district committee. Therefore, they established a water quality testing station and regularly reported the testing results to the district. One comrade wrote in his ideological gains: "In the past, I only wanted to be an expert and did not think about serving the masses. Now I understand that 'expertise' means doing what the masses need us to do."

During our conversation, a middle-aged man wearing glasses and covered in dust came to find Team Leader Zhu. Comrade Zhu Bihe said to me: "This is Comrade Zhang Baodong. Ask him to tell you the story of the horseflies." It turned out that Zhang Baodong was an assistant teacher in the Parasitology Teaching and Research Group before the transfer. After being transferred, he worked with farmers to study how to eliminate horseflies and deworm children, becoming a popular figure everywhere.

Also this spring, just when preparing to transplant rice seedlings, the backs of livestock plowing in the paddy fields were covered with swarms of horseflies. The livestock ran and jumped wildly after being bitten. Farmers plowing the fields, afraid of being bitten by horseflies, dared not go into the fields with bare legs, and had to wear long trousers soaked in the muddy water. Horseflies became a pest that harmed humans and animals and affected production. The commune cadres and farmers said to the transferred cadres: "You helped to do a good job in eliminating the four pests. It would be great if you could eliminate this pest (horseflies) now." This matter was entrusted to Zhang Baodong. However, Zhang Baodong, who had been studying parasites for six years, had only seen a specimen in school and did not recognize real horseflies. How to eliminate horseflies? He followed the old method and went back to Tianjin to check the literature. After searching through many materials, he could not find a solution, so he had to come back and consult the farmers. To his surprise, the old farmers told him a lot about the growth and development of horseflies, and many farmers even caught various types of horseflies for him to study. The farmers' help enabled him to collect eleven kinds of horseflies and compile a life history of the horseflies, finding ways to eliminate them on a large scale based on their life patterns. The district committee also strongly supported their research and allocated medicines. Zhang Baodong realized for the first time from the farmers' help in studying horseflies the mass line of research work. When he continued to study and trial-produce horsefly repellent oil, he went to the fragrance factory to find workers to study together from the beginning, and used the scraps from making fragrances to make nine kinds of horsefly repellent oil, which was cheap, effective, and suitable for mass use in rural areas. Zhang Baodong said with emotion: "Studying parasites but knowing nothing about horseflies shows that knowledge is too poor." Zhang Baodong and other comrades also found that most of the local children were pale and thin, so they examined more than 960 children, more than 800 of whom had roundworms in their stomachs. They gave these children a general deworming, eliminating more than 24,000 roundworms.

After Zhang Baodong finished telling the "Story of Horseflies," the leader of the transferred cadre team led me to visit their hospital called "Satellite." The hospital has departments of internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics. In the beginning, it was all run by transferred cadres. Now, there is only one transferred cadre left in the hospital as a doctor. This is Comrade Weng Liju, an obstetrician and gynecologist from the affiliated hospital before the transfer. Here, because of the needs of the masses, she sees both internal medicine and surgery; she also treats pediatric diseases. Labor training has improved her thinking, and she has become a versatile expert in technology. She participates in labor while treating farmers. Sometimes she goes out for consultations in the dark at night. People who know her say that she has changed a lot since she was transferred. Originally, this girl from Shanghai disliked being dirty, couldn't eat, wasn't used to living here, and kept running to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy things to eat. Compared with the past, she has become a different person.

The farmers said of the transferred cadres from the medical university: "The big doctors have become pig doctors." Indeed, I saw the transferred cadres performing surgery on pigs. It was Deng Guogang, an assistant teacher from the Physiology Teaching and Research Group, performing thyroidectomy on pigs. After this surgery, the weight gain rate of pigs can be increased by one to four times. Originally, they set up a hospital here, a weekly mobile medical team, and health stations. Farmers needed doctors and veterinarians, so they formed a research group, successfully experimented with and performed fattening surgery on a large number of pigs, and made veterinary chlortetracycline, establishing a factory that produces 30 kilograms of veterinary chlortetracycline per day. The produced chlortetracycline cured many sick animals. Doing whatever the farmers need became their action slogan. When the commune was established, the canteen needed to conduct key experiments, and one doctor was drawn from the transferred cadres to be the canteen manager. This doctor, who understood nutrition, was busy, anxious, and losing money in the canteen work. However, the masses needed the canteen, and finally, with the help of the masses, the canteen was successfully run, creating experience for canteen reform. They found that doctors and canteen managers were not unrelated. They found work that should be done in the canteen: they gave all cooks physical examinations, carried out infectious disease prevention, and investigated the nutritional status of each canteen, improving canteen management. In order to make their work take root in the countryside, they held many training classes for Red Cross health workers, nursery workers, and midwives, and also trained and improved a veterinarian. Recently, they established a medical school for the commune, training 25 young rural men and women who can reach the level of medical workers after one and a half years of study.

When I left Daan, I felt a little regret that I was unable to talk to a comrade named Wu Jizhen, who had gone to Tianjin. This young surgeon from the affiliated hospital before the transfer did not want to go to the countryside on the eve of last year's transfer and hid in Shanghai. Later, with the help of comrades, he still came to the countryside. I only knew that he later became an activist in labor and social work and was elected as a representative to the Hebei Provincial Congress of Transferred Cadres. In the evening, when I was about to leave, the person who led the way for me was Comrade Wu Jizhen. It turned out that he had already returned. It was very dark on the road. Although he was nearsighted, he was so familiar with the road and greeted the farmers who came across him from time to time. He told me that he had gone to labor, attended meetings, and taken cultural classes at night countless times in the past year. He was both familiar and close to life here. Already in the countryside, he still insisted on sending me a section of the road in the tone of an old farmer. Shortly after I said goodbye to him, his singing came from the dark nearby, and he was happily singing a ditty. From Wu Jizhen and his fellow comrades, I deeply felt how great and wise the Party's measure of labor training to cultivate cadres is. (Attached picture)

    把技术献给农民是最大幸福
    ——访问天津医大下放干部
    本报记者  张映华
    去年11月，天津医科大学把一百多个教职员和附属医院的医护干部，下放到天津郊区小站人民公社（当时的大安农业社）劳动锻炼。最近我去访问他们的时候，他们正在打谷场上和老社员一起收获丰收了的小站稻。他们当中的大多数人，在去年这时下放时，认为农村既没有参考书又没有试验室，只能荒废业务，因而情绪不高。现在，他们的这种看法怎么样了呢？下放干部队队长朱必和同志在一间小屋子里让我看了放在那里的一些化验工具：玻璃试管、药瓶子以后，谈了这样一件事：今年春天，社里陆床和水床上培养的水稻秧苗，已经长起一寸高的时候，天旱缺水，唯一的水源马场减河干了，稻秧受到了威胁，人们非常焦急。就在这时河里突然来水了，但水的颜色不正常，是黑的。这水能不能用呢？下放干部们化验了一下，发觉水里的含盐量达2％到4％，这种水田里是不能用的。他们把这个情况报告了区委，区委通告了各乡，停止用这种水灌地。后来已经灌了这种水的稻秧，大多坏了，可是河两岸大部分稻秧保护下来了。他们这次化验工作受到了区委表扬。于是他们成立了水质化验站，经常把化验情况向区里报告。一位同志在思想收获里写道：过去只想当专家，不去想给群众办事，现在才懂得专就是要作群众需要我们作的事。
    我们在谈话的时候，一位满身尘土的戴近视眼镜的中年人来找朱队长，朱必和同志对我说：“这是张宝栋同志，请他给你讲讲牛虻的故事。”原来张宝栋下放前是寄生虫教研组的助教，他下放后和农民一起研究消灭牛虻和为儿童驱除蛔虫，成了到处受群众欢迎的人。
    也在今年春天，正当准备播秧的时候，水田里耙地的牲畜背上爬满了成群的牛虻。牲畜被叮的乱跑乱跳。耙地的农民为防牛虻叮咬，不敢光腿下地，只好穿上长裤浸在泥水里。牛虻成了危害人畜影响生产的一害。社干部和农民对下放干部们说：“你们帮助搞好了除四害，现在能再除这一害（指牛虻）就太好了。”这件事就交给了张宝栋。可是搞了六年寄生虫的张宝栋，只是在学校里看见过一个标本，并不认识真正的牛虻。怎样消灭牛虻呢？他按过去的办法，回天津去查文献。翻遍了许多资料，也没找出办法来，只好回来访问农民。使他意外的是老农们告诉他许多关于牛虻生长发育的知识，不少农民还捉来了各种不同类型的牛虻供他研究。农民们的帮助使他搜集到了十一种牛虻，并且编出了牛虻生活史，从牛虻的生活规律找出了大规模消灭的办法。区委对他们的研究也大力支持，还给拨来了药品。张宝栋从农民帮助他研究牛虻的事实里第一次体会到研究工作的群众路线，他在继续研究试制驱虻油时，一开始就去香料工厂找工人共同研究，用制香料的下脚料，制成了九种驱虻油，既便宜又有效，适合农村大量使用。张宝栋感慨地说：“研究寄生虫却对牛虻一无所知，可见知识太贫乏了。”张宝栋还和其他同志发现当地儿童大多面黄肌瘦，便为九百六十多个儿童作了检查，其中有八百多人腹内有蛔虫，就为这些孩子作了一次普遍驱蛔，打下了两万四千多条蛔虫。
    张宝栋讲完了“牛虻的故事”后，下放干部队长领我去参观他们办起的名叫“卫星”的医院。这所医院设有内、外科、产科和小儿科。一开始全是由下放干部办起来的，现在留在医院里当大夫的下放干部，只有一个人了。这就是下放前附属医院的妇产科大夫翁梨驹同志。她在这里因为群众的需要，既看内科又看外科；小儿科的病也要治。劳动锻炼使她思想有了提高，技术上也成了多面手。她一面参加劳动，一面给农民看病，有时夜里也摸着黑出诊，认识她的人都说她下放后变化很大。原来这位来自上海的姑娘刚下来时，嫌脏、吃不下、住不惯，还不断地跑往供销社买东西吃。前后对比她变成两个人了。
    农民们说医大的下放干部：“人大夫当了猪大夫”。果然我看到了下放干部给猪动手术的事情。那是生理教研组的助教邓国刚给猪作甲状腺切除手术，作了这种手术后，猪的体重增长率可提高一到四倍。本来他们在这里办起了医院和每周一次的巡回医疗队及保健站，农民们需要医生也需要兽医，他们就成立了研究小组，试验成功并给大批猪作了催肥手术；又制成了兽用金霉素，建立了一个日产三十斤的兽用金霉素厂。生产出的金霉素，治好了许多病畜。农民需要干什么就干什么，成了他们的行动口号。公社成立时，食堂要办重点试验，从下放干部中抽了一位大夫去当食堂管理员。这位懂营养知识的大夫被食堂工作弄得又忙又急又赔钱。可是群众需要食堂，终于在群众帮助下把食堂办好了，为食堂化创造了经验。他们发觉大夫与食堂管理员并不是毫不相干的事。他们在食堂工作中找到了应作的工作：给所有炊事员作了体格检查，作了传染病预防；又作了各食堂营养状况的调查，改善了食堂管理工作。为了使他们的工作在农村扎下根，他们开办了多次红十字卫生员、保育员、接生员训练班，还培养提高了一位兽医。最近他们为公社办起了一所医学院，培养着二十五名农村青年男女，他们学习一年半以后就可达到医士水平。
    我离开大安的时候，觉得有一点遗憾的是没有能够和一位叫吴继珍的同志谈谈，他正到天津去了。这位下放前的附属医院的青年外科大夫，在去年下放前夕，他不愿到农村躲到上海去了，后来经过同志们的帮助还是到农村来了。我只知道他后来在劳动和社会工作里成了积极分子，并且被选为参加河北省下放干部代表会的代表。晚上，当我要走的时候，给我领路的正是吴继珍同志，原来他已回来了。在路上天很黑，他虽然眼近视，但对路却那么熟悉，并且不时地和对面走来的农民打着招呼。他告诉我一年来去劳动、去开会、去上文化课在夜里走了不知有多少次，这里的生活他既熟悉又亲切。已经到野外了，他像用一个老农民那样的口气仍然要坚持再送我一段路。当我和他告别后不久，就在黑暗的近处，传来了他的歌声，他愉快地在唱一支小调。从吴继珍和他一起的同志们身上，使我深深感到党的劳动锻炼培养干部的措施是多么伟大和英明。（附图片）
