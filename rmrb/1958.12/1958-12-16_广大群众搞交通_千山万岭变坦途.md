The broad masses engage in transportation, turning thousands of mountains and ridges into smooth roads.

Hunan masses build 10,000 kilometers of roads and manufacture 130,000 vehicles in one month.

Where there is a factory, there is a road; where there is a road, there is traffic;
Factory and commune roads are motorized, highways are vehicle-ized;
Making vehicles and boats, transport capacity doubles.

Changsha, December 15th (Report from our newspaper) - While vigorously grasping steel transportation, Hunan Province has launched a mass transportation construction movement focused on road building, river dredging, vehicle manufacturing, and boat building. This has basically driven away the "roadblock" that has long plagued transportation – the contradiction between transport capacity and transport volume.

Since late October, Hunan Province has mobilized over 600,000 laborers for road building, river dredging, vehicle manufacturing, and boat building. According to statistics from November 20th, the province has newly built 982 simple roads, totaling over 10,000 kilometers, opened and renovated 159 waterways, stretching 4,344 kilometers, constructed over 800 kilometers of new bamboo, wood-rail earth railways, built 2,400 kilometers of aerial cableways, and manufactured over 130,000 various vehicles and over 3,000 small boats. This has achieved a transport capacity capable of handling 10 million tons of short-distance transportation per month, fundamentally resolving the contradiction between transport capacity and transport volume. It has accelerated short-distance transportation and greatly saved rural labor.

Since the second half of this year, Hunan Province's transport volume has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year, while the increase in transportation tools has been relatively small. The contradiction between transportation capacity and transport volume has become increasingly serious. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the above situation in late October and believed that the fundamental solution was to improve transportation conditions and increase transportation tools. Therefore, while vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" for transportation, the Provincial Committee issued instructions on October 20th, requiring all localities to launch a mass movement for road building, river dredging, vehicle manufacturing, and boat building this winter, to vigorously develop transportation construction. Through extensive airing of views and debates, transportation construction was linked to the immediate interests of the masses, enabling cadres and the masses to realize that only by carrying out transportation construction can we guarantee the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and fundamentally change the situation of labor shortage. Cadres and the masses broke the "mystery" and "conditional" theories of transportation construction, adapting to local conditions, simplifying processes, substituting indigenous methods for foreign ones, and using small projects to drive large ones, thus resolving difficulties in manpower, financial resources, and materials. In the Shaoyang Special District, 237 simple roads, totaling more than 2,400 kilometers, were built, 870 kilometers of waterways were opened, and 20,000 vehicles and 238 small boats were manufactured in twenty-five days. In Guzhang County, where thousands of mountains and ridges lie, the Tujia and Miao people organized a shock brigade of 15,000 people, creating an advanced construction method of segmented contracting, and within five days, they newly built 176 kilometers of roads in the mountainous area.

After vigorously developing transportation construction, many places quickly saw a new situation in transportation. Shuangfeng County has achieved automobile access to every commune and vehicle lanes in factories and mines. In October, it completed the transportation of more than 146,000 tons of materials, an increase of 192% compared to September, basically achieving smooth material flow without backlogs. Shaodong County has enabled all 17 people's communes, 130 iron factories, and more than 50 coal mines in the county to achieve "where there is a factory, there is a road; where there is a road, there is traffic; factory and commune roads are motorized, highways are vehicle-ized."

On the basis of existing achievements, Hunan Province is now organizing another mass transportation construction movement centered on vigorously developing ox carts, earth trains, and canal boat transport, in combination with shifting to the agricultural center and before the rainy season, based on the new situation after the people's commune-ization and the base-ization of steel production throughout the province. This will enable the 1.3 million kilometers of newly built canals this winter and spring to develop small boats and large rafts, realizing navigation to the front and back of houses, and boats to the mountains, fields, and houses. Breaking the southern tradition of not using ox-drawn carts, the province will enable 3 million cattle to pull carts, developing 1 million ox carts. At the same time, earth trains will be used wherever possible. The full-scale promotion of ball bearing-ization, vehicle-ization, two-wheel to four-wheel conversion, and iron-wood wheel to rubber wheel conversion will gradually realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of folk transportation tools.

Jiangsu Sihong County organized an 180,000-strong road-building army, building wide and smooth roads on the county's 220-kilometer-long rural and commune routes, paving them with sandy gravel that is stronger than crushed bricks, allowing for unimpeded passage in both sunny and rainy weather.

    广大群众搞交通  千山万岭变坦途
    湖南群众一个月修路一万公里造车十三万辆
    有厂就有路，有路就通车；
    厂社公路化，公路车子化；
    造车又造船，运力成倍加。
    本报长沙15日电  湖南省在大抓钢铁运输的同时，开展了以修路、修河、造车、造船为主要内容的群众性交通建设运动。基本上赶走了交通运输上长期不能赶走的“拦路虎”——运力不能适应运量的矛盾。
    从10月下旬起，湖南省投入修路、修河、造车、造船的劳动力共达六十多万人。据11月20日统计，全省新修简易公路九百八十二条，一万多公里，开辟与整治航道一百五十九条，长四千三百四十四公里，新建竹、木轨土火车道八百多公里，高空索道二千四百公里，制造各种车子十三万多辆，小船三千多只。达到了每月能负担一千万吨的短途运输任务的运力，基本解决了运力不能适应运量的矛盾。加速了短途运输。并大大节省了农村劳动力。
    从今年下半年开始，湖南省运量比去年同时期增长一倍以上，而运输工具的增长幅度较小，运输力量不能适应运量要求的矛盾，越来越严重。中共湖南省委在10月下旬分析了以上情况，认为解决矛盾的根本办法是改善交通条件，增加运输工具。因此，省委在大力开展“小土群”运输的同时，于10月20日发出指示，要求各地在今冬开展一个群众性的修路、修河、造车、造船大搞交通建设的运动，经过大鸣大放，把交通建设和群众的切身利益结合起来，使干部和群众认识到只有进行交通建设，才能保证工农业生产的跃进，才能根本改变劳力不足的局面。干部与群众破除了交通建设的“神秘论”、“条件论”、因地制宜，因陋就简，以土代洋，以小带大，使人力、财力、物力等困难都迎刃而解。邵阳专区就在二十五天内修筑起简易公路二百三十七条，二千四百多公里，开辟航道八百七十公里，造车二万辆，小船二百三十八只。千山万岭的古丈县土家族、苗族的群众组织了一万五千人的突击大军，创造了分段包干的先进施工方法，五天内，在山区新修道路一百七十六公里。
    许多地方在大搞交通建设之后，运输状况很快就出现了新的局面。双峰县已经做到社社通汽车，厂矿有车道。十月份就完成了十四万六千多吨物资运输任务，比9月份运量提高192％，基本上做到了物资通畅，没有积压。邵东县已经使全县十七个人民公社一百三十个铁厂，五十多座煤矿，实现了有厂就有路，有路就通车，厂社公路化，公路车子化。
    湖南省各地在现有成绩基础上，正根据人民公社化和钢铁生产基地化后的新情况，在全省范围内结合转入农业中心，和趁雨季前再组织一次以大搞牛车、土火车、渠道船运化为中心的交通建设群众运动，使全省今冬明春新筑的一百三十万公里的渠道，发展小船、大簰，实现屋前屋后通航，山区、田边、屋边有船往。破除南方历来不用牛拉车的习惯，使全省三百万头牛拉车，发展一百万部牛车。同时使能通土火车的地方都通土火车。全面推广滚珠轴承化、车子化、两轮改四轮，铁木轮改胶轮，使民间运输工具逐步实现半机械化和机械化。

    江苏泗洪县组织了十八万筑路大军，在全县二百二十多公里的乡社线路筑起了宽坦的公路，铺上了比碎砖还坚固的砂礓，晴雨通行无阻。
