Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 11th regarding the TASS statement, once again clamoring that the U.S. refuses to withdraw from West Berlin.

The State Department's statement dared not directly answer the TASS statement's righteous and stern condemnation of the Western countries' unreasonable attitude of refusing to agree to turn West Berlin into a free city, but groundlessly said that the TASS statement had a "stronger threatening tone."

The State Department's statement repeated the rhetoric of U.S. officials, saying that the U.S. would not "cease to defend its rights and fulfill its responsibilities to West Berlin."

The statement said that the U.S., in consultation with its allies, will provide a formal response to the Soviet Union's November 27th note at an "appropriate time."

    美国不敢正面回答
    再次叫嚷拒绝撤出西柏林
    新华社12日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务院11日就塔斯社的声明发表声明，再一次叫嚷美国拒绝撤出西柏林。
    国务院的声明不敢正面回答塔斯社声明对西方国家拒绝同意把西柏林变为自由城市的无理态度的义正词严的谴责而毫无道理地说塔斯社的声明“威胁的语气更重了”。
    国务院的声明重复美国官方人物的论调，说什么美国不会“不再保卫它的权利和履行它对西柏林的责任”。
    声明说，美国在同它的盟国磋商之下，将在“适当时候”对苏联11月27日的照会提出正式答复。
