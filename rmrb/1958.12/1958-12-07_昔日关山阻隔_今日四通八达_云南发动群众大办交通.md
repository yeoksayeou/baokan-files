Yunnan Province is implementing the "small-scale, indigenous methods, mass participation" approach to road construction, with the entire party and all the people vigorously developing transportation, leading to tremendous changes in transportation conditions. According to incomplete statistics, from January to November this year, the province has newly built over 5,000 kilometers of highways and over 17,000 kilometers of cart roads. Furthermore, over 6,000 kilometers of highways are under full-scale construction, most of which can be completed by the end of the year.

Yunnan's terrain is complex. The south is a tropical and river valley area, and the northwest is the Hengduan Mountains, with high mountains and deep valleys blocking each other, making transportation in the province very difficult. However, various economic forests, medicinal materials, and other plants are abundant in all regions, and underground mineral resources are also very rich. In recent years, with the development of economic construction, under the leadership of the Party, the highways newly built each year by the people of all ethnic groups have exceeded ten times the development speed before liberation. By last year, the mileage of highways open to traffic had increased from more than 2,000 kilometers before liberation to more than 11,000 kilometers.

Since the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the people's desire to rapidly improve transportation has become even more urgent, and a massive road construction upsurge has quickly emerged. The Zhaotong Special District mobilized people of all ethnic groups to recount the hardships of inconvenient transportation and calculate the difficulties of transportation, and soon more than 69,000 people went up the mountains to build roads. Regardless of wind or rain, they were splitting mountains and opening roads on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. This special district has built more than 1,000 kilometers of highways this year, expanding from four counties with traffic last year to eleven counties with highways. Baoshan County, combined with tool reforms, mobilized hundreds of thousands of people throughout the county to build more than 4,000 kilometers of highways, cart roads, and wheelbarrow roads in just over ten days, enabling most townships to have roads open to traffic. In the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the highway from Zhongdian County to Diqing, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, has already passed through the Great Snow Mountain and will be open to traffic by the end of the year. In Mouding County of the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, all key mining areas in the county have been connected by highways. Currently, there are still more than 200,000 road construction troops in the province, bravely fighting against high mountains and deep waters.

The completion of many new highways has powerfully promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production. It is estimated that with highways, each vehicle can save 500 laborers or 300 horses per day. This year, more than 20 million tons of materials have been transported via highways, an increase of more than double compared to last year.

    昔日关山阻隔  今日四通八达
    云南发动群众大办交通
    本报讯  云南省贯彻筑路工作的“小、土、群”方针，全党全民大办交通，使交通状况发生了巨大的变化。据不完全统计，今年1到11月份，全省新修公路五千多公里，牛马车路一万七千多公里，并有六千多公里公路正在全面施工，大部分可在年底完成。
    云南地形复杂，南部是热带和河谷地带，西北部是横断山脉，高山峡谷，相互阻隔，使全省的交通十分困难。但是，各地都盛产各种经济林木、药材等植物，地下矿藏也很丰富。几年来，随着经济建设的发展，各族人民在党的领导下，每年新修的公路，超过解放前发展速度的十倍以上。到去年，公路通车里程已由解放前的两千多公里增加到一万一千多公里。
    工农业大跃进以来，人民群众要求迅速改善交通面貌的愿望也更加迫切，很快就出现了声势浩大的筑路高潮。昭通专区发动各族群众诉了交通不便的苦，算了运输困难的账，很快就有六万九千多人上山修路。他们风雨无阻地在滇北高原上劈山开路，这个专区今年已经修公路一千多公里，由去年的四个县通车，发展到十一个县都有公路。保山县结合工具改革，全县几十万人一齐出动，十多天就修公路、牛马车路和独轮车路达四千多公里，使大部分乡都通车路。在迪庆藏族自治州，由中甸县到自治州首府迪庆的公路，已经穿过大雪山，年底即可通车。在楚雄彝族自治州的牟定县，全县几个重点矿区，都已通了公路。目前，全省还有二十多万筑路大军，正与高山深水奋勇搏斗。
    许多新公路的修成，有力地促进了工农业生产的发展。据推算，有了公路，每辆汽车每天可以节省五百个劳动力或三百匹马。今年来，通过公路运输的物资，达两千多万吨，比去年增长了一倍以上。
