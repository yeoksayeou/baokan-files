(Reported by this newspaper) The weightlifting competition between the Chinese Weightlifting Team, the Soviet Uzbek Weightlifting Team, and the Polish Central Council of Trade Unions Weightlifting Team concluded yesterday afternoon after two days of intense competition. In the seven weight classes, the Chinese team secured four first places, two second places, and one third place, totaling seventeen points, winning first place overall in the competition. The Soviet Uzbek team achieved three first places, three second places, and one third place, totaling sixteen points, securing second place overall. The Polish Central Council of Trade Unions Weightlifting Team won two second places and four third places, totaling eight points, securing third place overall.

In yesterday's light heavyweight competition, renowned Chinese weightlifter Zhao Qingkui clean and jerked 177.5 kilograms, surpassing his own world record of 176.5 kilograms set two months prior by one kilogram.

Zhao Qingkui's new world record in the clean and jerk was achieved during his third attempt last night. He initially requested to lift 167.5 kilograms, which he successfully completed with ease. He then attempted 177.5 kilograms. This energetic attempt of his attracted great attention from the audience. Zhao Qingkui pulled the barbell to his chest, stood up, and then jerked it overhead. It looked like he was about to succeed, but due to instability, he lowered the barbell prematurely and was judged to have failed. Three minutes later, Zhao Qingkui made his third attempt. As he walked to the barbell, the entire arena fell silent. People hoped for his success but also worried about his failure. Zhao Qingkui steadily completed the three movements from lifting the barbell to jerking it overhead, and a new world record was born. The entire arena erupted with excitement, and the applause continued for a long time. His weight and the barbell were measured on the spot. Zhao Qingkui's weight was 82.4 kilograms, and both his weight and the barbell met the requirements.

Zhao Qingkui also attempted to snatch 138.5 kilograms in yesterday's snatch competition, exceeding the world record by 0.5 kilograms, but he failed due to excessive tension.

Yesterday, the China-Soviet Union-Poland weightlifting competition held matches in four weight classes. Uzbek Sharibav won first place in the middleweight class with a total score of 390 kilograms. China's Shu Gang (360 kilograms) and Poland Central Council of Trade Unions Weightlifting Team's Aidemu De (350 kilograms) won second and third place in this weight class, respectively. Zhao Qingkui of China won first place in the light heavyweight class, with a total score of 430 kilograms. Uzbek Roscheskin's total score was 15 kilograms less than Zhao Qingkui, earning him second place. Poland Central Council of Trade Unions Weightlifting Team's Bohhnak came in third with a score of 377.5 kilograms. In the light heavyweight class, China's Li Baiyu won first place with a total score of 420 kilograms. Both his total score and his clean and jerk score broke the 1957 national records. Poland's Bialas (417.5 kilograms) secured second place in the light heavyweight class. Uzbek light heavyweight athlete Tampiev failed three times in the press, resulting in no total score. In the heavyweight competition, veteran Chinese athlete Chang Guanqun was full of energy. Although he came in second (395 kilograms), both his total score and two single-event scores broke last year's national records. Uzbek Kolebanov (427.5 kilograms) won first place in the heavyweight class, and Poland's Slovinski came in third (385 kilograms).

Yesterday's referees were Polish international referee Kohapevski·Tadeush, Chinese national referee Zeng Weiqi, and Soviet Uzbek Republic national referee A Huaniasov. (Attached picture)

    轻重级挺举一七七点五公斤
    赵庆奎再破世界纪录
    中苏波举重赛结束我国总分第一
    本报讯  中国举重队、苏联乌兹别克举重队和波兰总工会中央理事会举重队的比赛，经过两天的激战于昨天下午全部结束。在七个级别比赛中，中国队取得四个第一，两个第二和一个第三，共得十七分，获这次比赛的总分第一；苏联乌兹别克队得三个第一，三个第二和一个第三，共得十六分，获总分第二名；波兰总工会中央理事会举重队获两个第二，四个第三，共得八分，获总分第三名。
    在昨天的轻重级比赛中，我国著名举重选手赵庆奎挺起了一百七十七点五公斤，这个重量超过了他自己两个月前创造的一百七十六点五公斤的世界最高纪录一公斤。
    昨晚赵庆奎的挺举世界新成绩是在第三次试举时创造的。他第一次要求试举一百六十七点五公斤，很顺利地成功了。接着他就试举一百七十七点五公斤。他的这一干劲十足的尝试，引起了全场观众的极大的注意。只见赵庆奎把杠铃拉到胸前，站了起来，又挺上去了，看看要成功了，但由于重心不稳，杠铃过早地放下，被判失败。三分钟后，赵庆奎又作第三次试举。当他走至杠铃前，四座鸦雀无声。人们期望他成功，又耽心他失败。赵庆奎稳健地完成了从提铃到上挺的三个动作，又一个新的世界纪录诞生了。全场激动起来，掌声许久不停。当场称了体重和杠铃，赵庆奎的体重是八十二点四公斤，体重、杠铃都合格。
    赵庆奎昨天在抓举比赛中还试举了超过世界纪录点五公斤的重量——一百三十八点五公斤，由于他过分紧张而失败了。
    昨天中苏波举重比赛共进行了四个级的比赛。乌兹别克沙里巴夫以三百九十公斤的总成绩获中量级第一名，中国舒刚（三百六十公斤）、波兰总工会中央理事会举重队艾德姆德（三百五十公斤）分获这一级的第二、三名。获得轻重级第一名的是中国赵庆奎，他的总成绩是四百三十公斤。乌兹别克的罗斯切斯金的总成绩比赵庆奎少十五公斤获得第二。波兰总工会中央理事会举重队的波赫纳克得第三，他的成绩是三百七十七点五公斤。次重级比赛结果，中国李白玉以四百二十公斤的总成绩得第一。他的总成绩和挺举成绩都破1957年全国最高纪录。获得次重级第二名的是波兰的比亚拉士（四百一十七点五公斤），乌兹别克次重级运动员坦皮耶夫在推举中三次失败，无总成绩。重量级比赛，中国老将常冠群干劲十足，虽然得了第二（三百九十五公斤），但他的总成绩和两个单项成绩都打破去年全国纪录。获重量级第一的是乌兹别克的科莱巴诺夫（四百二十七点五公斤），波兰的斯洛维斯基得第三（三百八十五公斤）。
