Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: The National Congress of Representatives of Advanced Units in Socialist Agricultural Construction is in its fourth day today. Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a report on "Actively Developing Diversified Operations and Vigorously Increasing the Production of Non-Staple Foods" at the meeting. Seven representatives from Henan Province, Sichuan Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Fujian Province, Gansu Province, and Heilongjiang Province spoke at the meeting.

In his report, Li Xiannian first reviewed China's economic situation over the past year and focused on elaborating on the issue of actively developing diversified operations in rural areas, especially vigorously increasing the production of non-staple foods.

After analyzing the current production and supply of non-staple foods in his report, he pointed out that the fundamental purpose of developing production in our socialist country is to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of all members of society. The consistent policy of the Party and the government has been to gradually improve people's lives on the basis of developing production. He said that actively developing diversified operations and vigorously increasing the production of vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and other non-staple foods are of extremely important significance in strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidating rural people's communes.

Li Xiannian then put forward six methods for developing the production of vegetables, livestock, poultry, and other items to increase the supply of non-staple foods. These six methods are: First, every people's commune must greatly develop the production of self-sufficient non-staple foods on the one hand, and greatly develop the production of commercial non-staple foods in accordance with national plans and local conditions on the other hand. Second, in the production of non-staple foods, the principle of collective production by the commune as the main focus and individual production by commune members as a supplement should be implemented. Third, in the production and supply of vegetables, the principle of local production and local supply should be implemented. Fourth, in the production of non-staple foods, attention should first be paid to the increase in quantity, and the variety and quality must also be improved. Fifth, the planning of non-staple food production should be strengthened, and the needs of cities for non-staple foods should be closely integrated with the production arrangements of the people's communes through production and sales contracts. Sixth, in addition to actively helping people's communes develop the production of non-staple foods in collaboration with agricultural departments, commercial departments in various regions must also do a good job in purchasing, processing, supplying, and storing.

In his report, Li Xiannian also put forward some specific measures that must be taken this winter and next spring in order to further increase the current supply of non-staple foods. He also emphasized the importance of continuing to promote the fine tradition of diligence and thrift and implementing planned consumption.

Li Xiannian concluded his report by saying that actively developing diversified operations, greatly increasing the production of non-staple foods, and enabling the 650 million people to eat better day by day is a work of great political significance. We should greatly increase the variety of non-staple foods in the next few years, further improve the diet of the Chinese people, and greatly enrich people's nutrition. The key to achieving the above requirements lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party. He said, we believe that as long as we rely on the broad masses, resolutely implement the mass line, and combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and combine heat with cold, and everyone works together, we will surely achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, achieve a greater harvest, and make people's lives better day by day.

After Li Xiannian's report, representatives from seven provinces (autonomous regions) spoke at the meeting.

Xu Guoliang, representative of Henan Province (First Secretary of the Xinyang County Party Committee), said: The people of Henan Province have worked hard for the first year and have greatly changed the appearance of the entire province. This province, which has historically suffered many disasters and felt insufficient in food due to the planting of more cash crops, now has an average of more than 1,000 jin of grain per person this year. At the same time, cotton, oil crops, and other crops have also increased production. On the basis of a bumper harvest in agriculture, a high tide of the entire province and the entire people running iron and steel and running industry has rapidly formed in the second half of this year, completing this year's iron and steel production tasks. Xu Guoliang also said that in the future, we must always stand actively and enthusiastically with the masses at the forefront of construction, fully promote the spirit of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and complete and over fulfill the 1959 industrial and agricultural production plan in a down-to-earth manner.

Yang Yunkui, representative of Sichuan Province (Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture), after reporting to the conference on Sichuan Province's leap forward in agriculture this year, said that the most fundamental reason for obtaining this victory is the leadership of the Party and the mass line, the Party's continuous revolution ideology, the combination of hard work and pragmatic spirit, and the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture. Yang Yunkui also introduced Sichuan Province's Patriotic Health Campaign this year. He said that with these two movements combined, a new situation of "fields increasing grains, people increasing longevity, and new socialist countryside" has emerged in Sichuan Province. The peasants said that they do not worship heaven or earth, and will always follow Chairman Mao. Qi Piwen, representative of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Secretary of the Zhongning County Party Committee), reported that the changes in Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall this year gave the greatest encouragement to all the representatives. He said that this area beyond the Great Wall is demanding land from the Yellow River and grain from the barren mountains, and this year it has crossed the Yellow River in one step. The fact of this year's bumper harvest has greatly encouraged the confidence of the people throughout the region in rapidly changing the low-yield situation. In terms of the Patriotic Health Campaign, he said that the most serious infectious diseases that endanger the people of this region have been significantly reduced.

Chang Zhenyu, representative of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Minister of the Agricultural and Pastoral Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China), said: This year, due to increased grain production, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reached more than 1,000 jin of grain per person. The habit of extensive planting and low yield is changing. Livestock production in the entire region has basically achieved full stock, and the grazing, mating, and livestock breed improvement in pastoral areas are advancing at a growth rate of several times or more than ten times. In the new year, we must continue to exert our efforts and further change the backward situation left over from history in the autonomous region's agricultural production.

Guo Shuyao, representative of Fujian Province (Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China), in his speech, narrated that the people of Fujian Province have worked hard for a year this year and achieved the three major victories of supporting and participating in the frontline struggle, the entire people refining steel and iron, and an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. He said that more than 1,300 new small hydropower stations and more than 3,300 hydropower stations have been built in Fujian Province this year. Facts have proved that this is a link to developing industrial and agricultural production, reforming technology, improving labor efficiency, and improving people's lives, which will create extremely favorable conditions for the industrialization and agricultural mechanization and electrification of communes.

The representative who spoke from Gansu Province was Liang Zhaopeng, Director of the Survey and Design Department of the Yintao Shangshan Water Conservancy Project Bureau. Liang Zhaopeng said that Gansu Province's grain and cotton have grown several times and several times this year, which is the victory of the struggle against drought. Gansu is located on the Northwest Plateau, with a dry climate, sparse rainfall, and serious soil erosion. Yintao Shangshan is to change this situation. He said that after the completion of the Yintao project, which is 1,400 kilometers long and enables the Tao River to cross countless high mountains and narrow valleys, and finally leads the Tao River to the Dongzhiyuan in eastern Gansu, the more than 20 counties and cities through which the main canal flows will realize water conservancy in mountainous areas, a river network in high mountains, and rural electrification, turning 15 million mu to 20 million mu of dry land into paddy fields, and more than 100 small power stations can be built using the drop. The main canal will also become a water transportation line in the high mountain areas from southwestern to eastern Gansu Province, which can accommodate ships of 20 tons to 100 tons.

Zhang Xiwen, the last representative to speak today, the Deputy County Mayor of Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, reported on the province's leap in grain production this year. He said that although the victory achieved by Heilongjiang Province in agricultural production this year is not as good as that of the brother provinces and regions in Guan Nei, the total grain output is expected to increase. He also introduced the achievements made by Heilongjiang Province in land reclamation, health, animal husbandry, etc., and specifically narrated the experience of Keshan County in developing draught animals.

    使大家的生活一天比一天更加美好
    大力增产菜肉鱼蛋副食品
    李先念在农业先进单位代表会议上提出六项办法
    新华社28日讯  今天是全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的第四天。中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念在会上作了关于“积极开展多种经营，大力增产副食品”的报告。河南省、四川省、宁夏回族自治区、内蒙古自治区、福建省、甘肃省、黑龙江省的七位代表在会上作了发言。
    李先念在报告中首先回顾了一年来我国的经济形势，并着重地阐述了在农村中积极开展多种经营、特别是大力增产副食品的问题。
    他在报告中分析了目前副食品的生产和供应情况以后，指出，我们社会主义国家发展生产的根本目的，是最大限度地满足全体社会成员经常增长的物质和文化生活的需要。党和政府一贯坚持的方针，就是在发展生产的基础上，逐步改善人民生活。他说，积极开展多种经营，大力增产菜、肉、鱼、蛋和其他副食品，在加强城乡互助、巩固工农联盟和巩固农村人民公社方面，都是具有极为重大的意义的。
    李先念接着提出了发展蔬菜、家畜、家禽等项生产、增加副食品供应的六项办法，这六项办法就是：第一、每一个人民公社，一方面要大大发展自给性副食品生产，另一方面要根据国家计划和当地条件，大大发展商品性副食品生产。第二、在副食品的生产上，应当实行公社集体生产为主，社员个人生产为辅的原则。第三、在蔬菜的生产供应上，应当实行就地生产就地供应的原则。第四、在副食品的生产上，首先要注意数量的增加，又必须注意品种的齐全和质量的提高。第五、切实加强副食品生产的计划性，通过产销合同，把城市的副食品需要同人民公社的生产安排紧密地结合起来。第六、各地商业部门除了协同农业部门，积极帮助人民公社发展副食品的生产以外，还必须做好收购、加工、供应和保管工作。
    李先念在报告中还提出了为了进一步增加当前的副食品的供应而必须在今冬明春采取的一些具体措施。他并且强调指出继续发扬勤俭朴素的优良传统，实行有计划的消费的重要性。
    李先念在报告中最后说，积极开展多种经营，大量增产副食品，使六亿五千万人一天比一天吃得更好，这是一个具有重大政治意义的工作。我们应当在以后的几年以内，大大增加各种副食品，进一步改善我国人民的伙食，大大丰富人民的营养。实现上述要求的关键，在于加强党的领导。他说，我们相信，只要依靠广大群众，坚决贯彻执行群众路线，并且把冲天干劲与科学分析结合起来，把热与冷结合起来，大家共同努力，一定可以在1959年实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，得到更大的丰收，使人民的生活一天比一天更加美好。
    在李先念的报告以后，有七个省（自治区）的代表在会上发言。
    河南省代表（中共信阳县委第一书记）徐国梁发言说：河南省人民苦战第一年就使全省面貌发生了极大变化。这个历史上灾害较多、同时由于种经济作物较多而感到粮食不足的省，今年平均每人有了一千多斤粮食。同时，棉花、油料等作物也增产了。在农业大丰收的基础上，今年下半年又迅速形成了全省全民大办钢铁、大办工业的高潮，完成了今年的钢铁生产任务。徐国梁还说，我们今后要始终积极地热情地和群众一道站在建设的最前线，充分发扬革命热情与科学分析相结合的精神，踏踏实实地完成和超额完成1959年工农业生产计划。
    四川省代表（四川省农业厅厅长）杨允奎在向大会报告了四川省今年农业的跃进之后，他说，获得这个胜利，最根本的原因是党的领导和群众路线，是党的不断革命的思想，是干劲和务实神精的结合，是农业八字宪法。杨允奎还介绍了四川省今年的爱国卫生运动。他说，这两个运动结合起来，四川省就出现了“田增五谷人增寿，社会主义新农村”的新情况。农民说，他们不拜天，不拜地，永远跟着毛主席。宁夏回族自治区代表（中共中宁县委书记）齐丕文报告今年塞上江南的变化对全体代表鼓舞最大。他说：这个塞上地区向黄河要地、向荒山要粮，今年一步就跨过了黄河。今年丰产的事实，大大鼓舞了全区人民为迅速改变低产面貌的信心。在爱国卫生运动方面，他说：危害这个地区人民的最严重传染病已显著减少了。
    内蒙古自治区代表（中共内蒙古自治区委员会农牧部部长）常振玉说：内蒙古自治区今年由于粮食增产，每人占有粮食已达千斤以上。广种薄收的习惯正在改变。畜牧生产全区已基本上实现了大畜满怀，牧区打草、配种和畜种改良都以几倍、十几倍的增长速度猛进着。在新的一年，我们要继续鼓足干劲，进一步改变自治区农业生产在历史上遗留下来的落后面貌。
    福建省代表（中共福建省委农村工作部部长）郭述尧的发言，叙述了福建省人民今年苦干了一年，取得了支援与参加前线斗争、全民炼钢炼铁和农业生产空前丰收的三大胜利。他说：今年福建省新建小型水电站一千三百多处，水力站三千三百多处。事实证明，这是发展工农业生产、改革技术、提高劳动效率、改善人民生活的一条纽带，这将为公社工业化和农业机械化、电气化创造极为有利的条件。
    甘肃省发言代表是引洮上山水利工程局勘测设计处处长梁兆鹏。梁兆鹏说：甘肃省今年粮棉成倍、成几倍地增长，就是和干旱斗争的胜利。甘肃处于西北高原，气候干燥，雨量稀少，水土流失严重。引洮上山就为了改变这个面貌。他说，全长一千四百公里，使洮河横越无数高山狭谷，最后把洮河引上陇东董志塬的引洮工程全部完成后，总干渠流经的二十多个县市，都将实现山区水利化，高山河网化，农村电气化，使一千五百万亩到二千万亩旱地变成水田，还可利用落差修一百多个小型发电站。总干渠并且将成为甘肃省西南部到东部高山地区的水上交通线，可以通二十吨到一百吨的船只。
    今天最后发言的黑龙江省代表（黑龙江省克山县副县长）张希文，报告了这个省今年粮食生产的跃进情况。他说，黑龙江省今年在农业生产上取得的胜利虽不如关内兄弟省区，粮食总产量预计仍都增了产。他还介绍了黑龙江省在垦荒、卫生、畜牧等方面所取得的成就，并具体叙述了克山县发展耕畜的经验。
