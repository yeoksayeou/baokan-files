Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 5th: In the Soviet Union's "Black Metallurgy Pearl" – the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly region – large-scale iron ore development has already begun, with railways and many factories currently under construction. The development and construction of this region is an important component of the task of accelerating the development of the ferrous metallurgical industry and iron ore base, as stipulated in the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan. This was stated by Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Shevyakov in a recent article in "Pravda."

In recent years, many iron ore deposits with rich reserves suitable for large-scale mining have been discovered in this region, such as the Yakovlevsk and Gostishchevsk iron ore mines in the Belgorod region. The quality of the Yakovlevsk iron ore area is very good, with an iron content of about 60%, a ore body thickness of about 330 meters, and a width of about 350 meters. This mining area extends about 25 kilometers. The Gostishchevsk mining area is even larger, with a width of 200 kilometers in some places. It is estimated that the iron ore reserves in the Belgorod region alone reach more than 15 billion tons, which is about ten times more than the rich iron ore reserves of the Krivoy Rog region in the Soviet Union. Compared with the entire United States, its reserves are more than half as large. The total iron ore reserves in the United States are only 5.3 billion tons, and the iron content is only above 50%.

According to estimates by the Mining Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in the next five to seven years, the annual output of high-quality iron ore mined in the Kursk region by open-pit mining can reach more than 20 million to 21 million tons.

The Kursk Magnetic Anomaly region covers a vast area, from Orel in the north to Valuyki in the south, from Belgorod, Lgov, and Shevik in the west, and from Orel, Shchigry, and Stary Oskol in the east. The iron ore discovered now is only a part of it, but if these are mined on a large scale, they can supply the central and southern European steel bases of the Soviet Union with abundant and excellent raw materials. The exploitation of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly region will adopt modern science and technology and fast and economical methods.

World's Largest Timber Complex to be Built in Siberia in a Few Years

Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: According to TASS, Orlov, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Russian Federation, said that the Soviet Union will build the world's largest timber complex – the Bratsk Timber Complex – in Siberia in the next few years. This complex will be fully completed and put into production in 1963. It will produce many cellulose pulp, several thousand tons of cardboard, and several million cubic meters of sawn timber and wood panels annually.

Orlov said that the Soviet Union has now surpassed the United States in terms of timber harvesting and sawn timber production, ranking first in the world. In the next seven years, the most important task of the Soviet Union's timber industry is to catch up with and surpass the United States and Canada in terms of labor productivity in the logging industry. He said that compared with this year, by 1965, the labor productivity of the Soviet Union's logging industry will increase by 70%, which will make it possible to reduce the number of workers in this industrial sector by about 400,000.

The housing construction industry will actually be rebuilt. In the next few years, it will be able to produce 20 million square meters of prefabricated houses and 10 million square meters of house components annually.

In the next seven years, the development of the Soviet Union's furniture manufacturing industry and the paper industry related to the timber industry will also be rapid. Compared with this year, in 1965, the furniture output of the Russian Federation alone will increase by 1.7 times, and the paper output will increase by 60%.

World's First Nuclear Icebreaker "Lenin" Nears Completion

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 4th: The world's first nuclear icebreaker – the Soviet "Lenin", launched on December 5th last year – is currently undergoing smooth finishing work. The construction of complex and powerful nuclear power generators and other equipment inside the cabin is nearing completion. The installation of three nuclear reactors has been completed. On-site test runs began in October this year.

This was stated by Academician Alexandrov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences today in "Soviet Naval News" when introducing the structure of the icebreaker. He said that the "Lenin" nuclear icebreaker is not only the world's first icebreaker powered by nuclear energy, but also the world's largest icebreaker, with twice the horsepower of the largest American icebreaker "Glacier".

The icebreaker is equipped with three nuclear reactors. Usually, only two are started, and one is kept as a backup. When the nuclear reactor is started, it can emit powerful heat energy. A special device sends the heat energy into the steam generator, which instantly turns the water into high-pressure steam. This high-pressure steam then drives two turbine generators, each with a power generation capacity of 1,000 kilowatts. The generator current then drives three stern thrusters. He said that the nuclear icebreaker uses 1,200 volts of current as the power for the thrusters, which is the first time in shipbuilding practice.

The icebreaker also uses special steel with extremely strong magnetic permeability and excellent low-temperature resistance as the hull plates, ensuring that the icebreaker can smoothly break through thick ice layers during Arctic navigation. The shape of the bow adopts the most favorable one, which can make the relative value of the ship's pressure on the ice 15% greater than that of existing icebreakers. At the same time, the hull is divided into eleven watertight compartments, so if an accident occurs during navigation and two of the compartments are flooded, the icebreaker will not sink.

The icebreaker is equipped with all modern technical equipment for icebreaking navigation. Through these new devices, it is possible to know the thickness and flow of the ice layer in advance, and to rely on automatic operation to determine the position and navigate safely in extremely complex Arctic ice layers. The icebreaker is also equipped with powerful radios that can maintain regular contact with the mainland.

Now, the icebreaker decorators and scientific workers are actively completing the production tasks put forward to welcome the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

World's Tallest TV Tower to be Built in Moscow Next Year

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 5th: The Soviet Union will begin construction of a 508-meter-high TV tower in Moscow's new Cheryomushki district next year. This TV tower will be 176 meters higher than the Tokyo TV Tower (about 332 meters high), which Japan boasts as the world's tallest, and 128 meters higher than the current world's tallest building – New York's 102-story Empire State Building.

This tower will be a monolithic reinforced concrete structure. The base of the tower will have a diameter of 65 meters, and the top of the tower will also reach 7 meters in diameter. Two viewing platforms and a snack bar will be built at a height of 400 meters on the tower. The tower will be equipped with four high-speed elevators, which can take tourists to the viewing platform to overlook the scenery of Moscow.

At the bottom of the tower, a nine-story office building and some transmitters of the Moscow Television Center will be built.

    苏联大步向共产主义迈进
    库尔斯克铁矿远超美国大规模开发工作已开始
    新华社莫斯科5日电  在苏联的“黑色冶金珍珠”——库尔斯克地磁异常区，大规模铁矿开发工作已经开始，目前正在兴建铁路和许多厂房。这一地区的开发和建设是苏联在七年计划中规定要加速发展黑色冶金工业和铁矿基地任务中的重要组成部分。这是苏联科学院院士谢维雅科夫最近在“真理报”上一篇文章里说的。
    近年来这个地区发现了许多蕴藏量丰富，适于大规模开采的铁矿，例如别尔哥罗德地区的亚科夫列斯克和戈斯季谢夫斯克两个铁矿就是。亚科夫列斯克铁矿区的质量很好，矿石含铁量达到60％左右，矿体厚度达三百三十公尺左右，宽度约达三百五十公尺，这个矿区延伸约二十五公里；戈斯季谢夫斯克矿区更大，在它的某些地方宽度达到二百公里。据估计，仅别尔哥罗德地区铁矿的蕴藏量就达到一百五十亿吨以上，这比苏联的丰富的克里沃日斯克地区的铁矿蕴藏量还多十倍左右。要是跟整个美国比，它的蕴藏量也多一半以上。现在美国全国的铁矿蕴藏量才五十三亿吨，而且含铁量仅50％以上。
    据苏联科学院矿业研究院估计，在最近五年到七年内，在库尔斯克地区露天开采的优质铁矿每年可以达到二千到二千一百万吨以上。
    库尔斯克地磁异常区的面积巨大，北到奥勒尔城，南到瓦卢伊基城，西到别尔哥罗德、利戈夫和谢维克等城市，东到奥勒尔、希格里、斯塔雷奥斯科尔等城市。现在发现的铁矿只是其中的一部分，但只这些如加以大量开采的话，就可以供给苏联欧洲中部和南部钢铁基地以丰富的优良原料。库尔斯克地磁异常区的开采将采用现代科学技术，和又快又省的方法。
    世界最大的木材联合企业几年内将在西伯利亚建成
    新华社5日讯  据塔斯社报道：俄罗斯联邦国家计划委员会副主席奥尔洛夫说，苏联最近几年将在西伯利亚建成一座世界最大的木材联合企业——布拉次克木材联合企业。这座联合企业将在1963年全部建成并投入生产，它每年将生产许多纤维素沾液木浆、好几千吨纸板、几百万立方公尺锯材和木板。
    奥尔洛夫说，苏联现在已经在木材采伐量和锯材生产量方面超过了美国，而居世界第一位。今后七年间，苏联木材工业最重要的任务是要在伐木工业的劳动生产率方面赶上和超过美国和加拿大。他说，和今年比较，到1965年，苏联伐木工业的劳动生产率将提高70％，这将有可能使这一工业部门的工人人数减少大约四十万人。
    房屋建造工业实际上将要重新改建。在最近几年内，它每年就能生产二千万平方公尺的预装配房屋和一千万平方公尺的房屋部件。
    在今后七年，苏联的家具制造工业和与木材工业有关的造纸工业的发展也很快。和今年比较，1965年单是俄罗斯联邦的家具产量就将增加一点七倍，纸产量将增加60％。
    世界第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”接近全部竣工
    新华社莫斯科4日电  世界上第一艘原子破冰船——去年12月5日下水的苏联“列宁号”，目前正在顺利地进行建造收尾工作。舱内的、工程复杂、功率强大的原子动力发电机等装置工程已接近全部竣工阶段。三部原子反应堆的安装工程已经结束。从今年10月开始了原地试车。
    这是苏联科学院院士亚历山德罗夫今天在“苏联海军报”上介绍破冰船结构时说的。他说“列宁号”原子破冰船不仅是世界上第一艘利用原子能作动力的破冰船，而且也是目前世界上最大的破冰船，比最大的美国破冰船“冰河号”的马力还要大一倍。
    破冰船安装了三部原子反应堆。平时只开动两部，一部作为后备。原子反应堆开动时可以发出强大的热能。专门装置将热能送入蒸气发生器中，使其中的水即刻变为高压蒸气。这些高压蒸气再来推动两部发电能力各为一千瓩的汽轮发电机。发电机电流再带动三部船尾推进器。他说，原子破冰船利用了一千二百伏特的电流作为推进器的动力，这在造船实践上还是第一次。
    破冰船还使用了硬变极强和耐低温性能极好的特种钢作船板，保证破冰船在北极航行中可以顺利破开坚厚的冰层。船首的形式采用了最有利的一种，可以使船对冰的压力的相对值比现有破冰船大15％。同时船身隔成十一个不透水的舱，因此在航行中如果发生事故以致其中两个舱都灌满了水，破冰船也不会下沉。
    破冰船设有一切近代化破冰航行的技术装置，通过这些新装置可以预先知道冰层厚度和流动情况，能在极为复杂的北极冰层中依靠自动化操纵确定航位，安全航行。破冰船还装有强大的电台，可以与大陆保持经常联系。
    现在破冰船装修工人、科学工作者们正积极地完成为迎接苏共二十一次代表大会所提出的生产任务。
    世界最高的电视塔  明年在莫斯科兴建
    新华社莫斯科5日电  苏联明年将在莫斯科新切列穆什卡区动工兴建一座高达五百零八公尺的电视塔。这座电视塔比目前日本自诩为世界最高的东京电视塔（高约三百三十二公尺）还要高出一百七十六公尺，比目前世界最高的建筑物——纽约一百零二层的帝国大厦还要高一百二十八公尺。
    这座塔将是一个整体的钢筋混凝土建筑。塔基直径达六十五公尺，塔顶直径也达到七公尺。在塔的四百公尺高的地方建有两个看台和一个小食部。塔内装有四部快速电梯，可以把游客送到看台上俯瞰莫斯科的景色。
    在塔的底部将建造一座九层的办公大楼和莫斯科电视中心的一些发射台。
