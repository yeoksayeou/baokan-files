Great Potential in Fertilizer Sources, Just Waiting to be Tapped
Shandong Adopts "Four Chiefs Responsible, Four Routes Advancing" Method to Launch Winter Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign

    (Our dispatch) The winter fertilizer accumulation campaign in Shandong Province has begun to reach a climax in areas such as Liaocheng, Jining, Changwei, and Yantai.
    The experience of these areas proves that whether it is coarse fertilizer or fine fertilizer, there is still unlimited potential hidden, waiting for people to tap. Shouzhang and Yanggu are among the counties with more fertilizer application and higher yields. This year, the average application of coarse fertilizer per mu for summer and autumn crops and winter wheat reached 300,000 jin, and more than 1,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer. Since the beginning of winter, some people have worried that it will be difficult to dig up more fertilizer, and it will be difficult to leap forward in production next year. However, after planting wheat, these two counties found 18 kinds of local miscellaneous fertilizer sources. In more than a month, they applied another 50,000 jin of local miscellaneous fertilizer per mu of wheat. Penglai County, which is close to the sea, uses seawater and sea mud to manufacture nine kinds of local chemical fertilizers, with an average daily output of 500,000 jin of chemical fertilizer.
    Secondly, the "secretary takes command, four chiefs are responsible, and four routes advance" method is a successful experience widely adopted in Shandong for fertilizer accumulation. However, since the beginning of autumn, due to the large number of crash tasks in industrial and agricultural production, many places have not been able to adopt this method. At the same time, some areas, after communization, believed that fertilizer accumulation was a mature matter and could be done with just one call, resulting in it drifting along on its own. The Liaocheng area adhered to this method well. The prefectural party secretary took personal charge, and party secretaries at all levels took command, implementing the "four chiefs" responsibility system of county heads, commune chiefs, brigade leaders, and production team leaders. The fertilizer accumulation team was divided into four routes: local miscellaneous fertilizer team, local chemical fertilizer team, livestock manure accumulation team, and human waste accumulation team. As a result, from the end of wheat planting to December 11th, this area accumulated another 178.5 billion jin of local miscellaneous fertilizer and manufactured 48 kinds of local chemical fertilizers. Facts have proven that in areas where leaders go deep and take personal action, they not only discover more new fertilizer sources, but also create some new leadership methods.
    Another experience of these areas is to reorganize the specialized fertilizer accumulation teams and combine the specialized teams with the fertilizer accumulation of thousands of households, and combine regular fertilizer accumulation with key crash efforts. After communization, many areas implemented large-scale operations and organized large-scale cooperation, which affected regular fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, after the establishment of canteens and collective livestock feeding in various places, some cadres believed that there was no more profit to be made from farmers accumulating fertilizer. Liaocheng, Jining and other areas reorganized the specialized fertilizer accumulation teams according to these new situations. When establishing specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, some cadres did not understand, believing that industrial and agricultural tasks were heavy, labor was tight, and it was not appropriate to establish specialized teams. However, experience has proven that fertilizer accumulation and other industrial and agricultural production are mutually causal. The situation in many areas of Shandong proves that wherever industrial and agricultural production is good, fertilizer accumulation work is particularly good. The Liaocheng area has the best fertilizer accumulation, and the work of watering wheat and topdressing fertilizer, and water conservancy are also carried out the best. This area launched fertilizer accumulation by watering wheat, launched fertilizer accumulation by developing "fifteen raisings," conducted smoked fertilizer by winter plowing, and established local chemical fertilizer plants by developing commune industry.
    Now, party committees at all levels in Shandong Province are vigorously promoting these experiences. According to incomplete statistics, the province has accumulated more than 830 billion jin of various local miscellaneous fertilizers, built more than 32,800 local chemical fertilizer plants, produced more than 30 billion jin of local chemical fertilizers, and established 130 bacterial fertilizer plants.

    肥源潜力大  就待人来挖
    山东采取四长负责四路进兵的方法掀起冬季积肥运动
    本报讯  山东省冬季积肥运动，在聊城、济宁、昌潍、烟台等地区，开始形成高潮。
    这些地区的经验证明，无论是粗肥或细肥，都还蕴藏着无限的潜力，等待人们去挖。寿张、阳谷是施肥较多、产量较高的县份之一，今年夏秋作物和冬小麦平均每亩施粗肥达到三十万斤，土化肥一千多斤。入冬以来，有些人担心肥料不好再挖了，明年增产也难跃进了。但是这两个县在种完小麦以后，又找到十八种土杂肥源，一个多月的时间，每亩小麦又追上五万多斤土杂肥。紧靠大海的蓬莱县，利用海水、海泥，制造出九种土化肥，平均日产化肥五十万斤。
    其次是书记挂帅，四长负责，四路进兵，这本是山东在积肥上，普遍采用的成功经验。但是入秋以来，由于工、农业生产上的突击任务多，很多地方就顾不上采用这个办法了。同时有些地区在公社化以后，认为积肥已成熟事，一号召就行，结果自流下去。聊城专区坚持的好，地委书记亲自掌握，各级书记挂帅，实行县长、社长、大队长、生产队长的四长负责制，积肥队分成土杂肥队、土化肥队、牲畜积肥队、积人粪尿队四路大军。结果这个专区在种麦结束以后，到12月11日止，又积土杂肥一千七百八十五亿斤，制造土化肥四十八种。事实证明：凡是领导深入亲自动手的地区，不仅发现更多的新肥源，而且创造了一些新的领导方法。
    这些地区的另一条经验是重新整顿积肥专业队，专业队和千家万户的积肥相结合，经常性的积肥和重点突击相结合。公社化以后，许多地区由于实行大兵团作战和组织大协作，使经常性的积肥受到影响。同时在各地建立食堂和牲畜集体喂养以后，有些干部认为农家积肥没大油水了。聊城、济宁等地区根据这些新的情况，重新整顿了积肥专业队。在建立专业积肥队时，有的干部不通，认为工农业任务重，劳力紧张，不宜成立专业队。但是经验证明，积肥和其他工农业生产是互为因果的。山东许多地区情况证明，凡是工农业生产好的地方，积肥工作都搞得特别好。聊城专区积肥最好，而浇麦追肥、水利等工作也开展得最好。这个专区通过浇麦发动积肥，通过开展“十五养”也发动积肥，通过冬翻地搞了熏肥，通过发展公社工业建立了土化肥厂。
    现在山东省各级党委正在大力推广这些经验，据不完全统计，全省已积各种土杂肥八千三百多亿斤，建土化肥厂三万二千八百多处，生产土化肥三千多亿斤，建立菌肥厂一百三十个。
