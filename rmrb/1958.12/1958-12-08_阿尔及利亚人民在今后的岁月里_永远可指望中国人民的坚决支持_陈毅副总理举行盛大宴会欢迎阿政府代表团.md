Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a grand banquet this evening to warmly welcome all the distinguished guests of the Provisional Government Delegation of the Republic of Algeria. In his speech at the banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi solemnly declared: "In the years to come, the Algerian people can always count on the firm support of the 650 million Chinese people!"

Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders attended the banquet. At the banquet filled with comradeship, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Minister Youssef Ben Khedda both warmly celebrated the victory of the heroic Algerian people's anti-colonialist struggle, hailed the unity of the Asian and African people, and unanimously pointed out that the day when the entire Africa belongs to Africans is not far away!

The banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was hung with the national flags of China and Algeria. The hall was filled with flowers and evergreen palms. Red palace lanterns and dozens of huge red silks several feet long decorated the entire banquet hall with a new look.

On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, Vice Premier Chen Yi first addressed the banquet, paying high tribute to the heroic Algerian people. He said that the deep friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people has developed in the common struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Algerian people as their own struggle, and the victory of the Algerian people as their own victory. The Chinese people know from their long experience in the anti-imperialist struggle that no matter how tortuous the road of struggle is, the Algerian people who have raised the banner of national liberation are bound to win.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that socialist countries have always supported the struggle of all oppressed nations for independence and freedom. The existence of a strong socialist camp provides unprecedentedly favorable conditions for this struggle. In the common struggle against imperialism, the militant friendship between the Asian and African people and the socialist countries is developing day by day. Socialist countries are the most reliable friends of all oppressed nations. With the support of a strong socialist camp, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have become an irresistible trend of history, and the day when imperialism will be finished all over the world is getting closer and closer.

Then, in his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi severely condemned Dulles' recent shameless provocation of discord between socialist countries and nationalist countries, and refuted Dulles' and Tito's shameless slander against our people's commune movement.

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally pointed out: Algeria is the Algeria of the Algerian people. The French colonialists' attempt to turn it into a province of France will never succeed. No matter how difficult and long the struggle is, the Algerian people's just struggle against the enslavement of French colonialism and for national independence and freedom is bound to win. In the years to come, the Algerian people can always count on the firm support of the 650 million Chinese people!

Thunderous applause resounded in the banquet hall for a long time, and more than 300 Chinese and foreign guests warmly welcomed the envoys of the heroic people to speak at the banquet. Minister Youssef Ben Khedda first warmly expressed that they brought the respect of the fighting Algerian people to the Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong.

In his speech, the minister once again denounced the atrocities of the French colonialists and sternly condemned the support of the American imperialists for the French colonialists. He said that in the war of colonial plunder, France received military and financial assistance from its Atlantic allies, mainly the United States. This assistance is supporting a war that is destroying the Algerian people and dangerously threatening world peace. The Algerian guest pointed out that the Algerian people are part of the Arab nation. The Arab nation is waging a fierce struggle to liberate themselves completely from the shackles of imperialism. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has been recognized by Arab countries, China, and other Asian countries, which has shattered de Gaulle's "integration" rhetoric internationally.

He emphasized that the Algerian people are not isolated. Their struggle is part of the great movement of the people of Asia and Africa to fight for liberation. After being driven out of Asia, imperialism desperately tried to stay in Africa. But in Africa, the people will also force imperialism to its defeat. The day when the entire Africa belongs to Africans is not far away.

Minister Youssef Ben Khedda finally firmly declared: The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, determined to persevere in the struggle until victory, is in favor of peace, but this must be a peace that respects honor, dignity, freedom, and national independence!

All the guests warmly welcomed the speeches of Vice Premier Chen Yi and Minister Youssef Ben Khedda with bursts of applause. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of Algeria and China.

Arab United Republic Ambassador to China, Ragheb, delivered a congratulatory toast at the banquet. He said, I congratulate the Arab countries, especially Algeria, on the growing friendship with the People's Republic of China.

Before the banquet, a reception was held. Vice Premier Chen Yi introduced the distinguished guests to people from all walks of life in our country. Attending the reception and banquet were also Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee Bao Erhan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

    阿尔及利亚人民在今后的岁月里  永远可指望中国人民的坚决支持
    陈毅副总理举行盛大宴会欢迎阿政府代表团
    新华社7日讯  陈毅副总理今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团全体贵宾。陈毅副总理在宴会上的讲话中庄严地宣称：“在今后的岁月里，阿尔及利亚人民永远可以指望六亿五千万中国人民对他们的坚决支持！”
    周恩来总理和其他国家领导人出席了宴会。在充满战友深情的宴会上，陈毅副总理和优素福·本·赫达部长在讲话中都热烈地庆祝英勇的阿尔及利亚人民反殖民主义斗争的胜利，欢庆亚非人民的团结，并且一致指出整个非洲属于非洲人的日子已经不远了！
    北京饭店的宴会大厅里高悬着中阿两国国旗。大厅四周满布鲜花和常青棕榈。红色的宫灯和数十面几丈长的巨幅红绸，把整个宴会大厅装饰得焕然一新。
    陈毅副总理代表中国政府和中国人民，在宴会上首先致词向英雄的阿尔及利亚人民致以崇高的敬意。他说，中国人民同阿尔及利亚人民之间的深厚友谊是在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中发展起来的。中国人民一向把阿尔及利亚人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把阿尔及利亚人民的胜利看成是自己的胜利。中国人民从自己反对帝国主义的长期斗争经验中深知，不管斗争的道路多么迂回曲折，已经举起了民族解放的旗帜的阿尔及利亚人民是一定要胜利的。
    陈毅副总理强调说，社会主义国家一贯支持一切被压迫民族争取独立、自由的斗争。一个强大的社会主义阵营的存在为这一斗争提供了空前有利的条件。在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，亚非人民同社会主义国家的战斗友谊一天一天在发展。社会主义国家是一切被压迫民族的最可靠的朋友。在强大的社会主义阵营的支持之下，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动已经成为一支不可抗拒的历史潮流，帝国主义在全世界完蛋的日子里已经越来越近了。
    接着，陈毅副总理在讲话中严厉地谴责了杜勒斯最近对社会主义国家和民族主义国家之间的友好合作的无耻挑拨离间，驳斥了杜勒斯和铁托对我国人民公社运动的无耻污蔑。
    陈毅副总理最后指出：阿尔及利亚是阿尔及利亚人民的阿尔及利亚，法国殖民主义者企图把它变成法国的一省，那是永远办不到的。不管斗争多么艰苦，多么长期，阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民主义的奴役、争取民族独立和自由的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。在今后的岁月里，阿尔及利亚人民永远可以指望六亿五千万中国人民对他们的坚决支持！
    宴会大厅里长时间地响起了春雷般的掌声，三百多位中外来宾热烈欢迎英雄人民的使者在宴会上讲话。优素福·本·赫达部长首先热情地表示，他们带来了战斗着的阿尔及利亚人民对中国人民和毛泽东主席的敬意。
    这位部长在讲话中再一次控诉了法国殖民者的暴行，严正地谴责了美帝国主义对法国殖民者的支持。他说，在殖民掠夺的战争中，法国得到了它的大西洋盟国，主要是美国的军事和财政上的援助。这一援助接济着一个毁灭阿尔及利亚人民的战争，并且危险地威胁着世界和平。阿尔及利亚贵宾指出，阿尔及利亚人民是阿拉伯民族的一部分。阿拉伯民族正在展开激烈的斗争以争取把他们自己从帝国主义的桎梏下完全解放出来。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府得到了阿拉伯各国、中国和其它亚洲国家的承认，这在国际上粉碎了戴高乐的“整体化”的论调。
    他强调说，阿尔及利亚人民不是孤立的。他们的战斗是亚非各国人民争取解放的巨大运动的一部分。帝国主义在被赶出亚洲以后，就拼命设法赖在非洲。但是在非洲，人民也将同样地迫使帝国主义走向失败。整个非洲属于非洲人的日子已经不远了。
    优素福·本·赫达部长最后坚决地宣称：决心坚持斗争直到获得胜利的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府是拥护和平的，但是这必须是尊重荣誉、尊严、自由和民族独立的和平！
    全体来宾以一阵又一阵的掌声，热烈欢迎陈毅副总理和优素福·本·赫达部长的讲话。在他们讲话以后，乐队奏起了阿中两国国歌。
    阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使拉加卜在宴会上致词祝酒，他说，我祝贺阿拉伯各国特别是阿尔及利亚，同中华人民共和国之间的友谊关系愈来愈好。
    宴会开始以前举行了酒会，陈毅副总理介绍贵宾同我国各方面人士见面。出席酒会和宴会的，还有李济深、郭沫若、程潜副委员长，国防委员会副主席张治中，政协全国委员会副主席、中国亚非团结委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等和各国驻华使节。
