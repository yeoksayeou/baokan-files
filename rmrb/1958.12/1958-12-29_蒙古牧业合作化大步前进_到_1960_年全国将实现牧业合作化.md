Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 27th – Mongolia’s socialist transformation of animal husbandry achieved remarkable success in 1958. The First Deputy Minister of the Mongolian Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Baljinnyam, said at a press conference today that, based on the current rate of development, national pastoral cooperativization can be fully realized by 1960.

Compared to 1955, according to statistics on September 1st of this year, the number of pastoral households joining cooperatives increased from 25,000 to more than 110,000, and the number of livestock joining cooperatives and privately owned livestock of cooperative members increased from 3.1 million head to more than 14.46 million head. Currently, 56% of the country's pastoral households have joined cooperatives, and the number of livestock joining cooperatives and privately owned livestock of cooperative members accounts for more than 61% of the total livestock.

The development scale and speed of Mongolian cooperatives this year exceeded any previous year. In terms of pastoral households joining cooperatives, 1956 saw an increase of 24,000 households compared to 1955, and 1957 saw another increase of 20,000 households, while this year saw an increase of more than 40,000 households compared to last year.

Baljinnyam said that the superiority of pastoral cooperativization is mainly reflected in livestock breeding, with cooperatives overfulfilling their livestock breeding plans last year and this year.

The reason for the faster development of cooperativization this year is that herders have seen the superiority of collectivization in livestock breeding demonstrated by cooperatives in the past two years, and therefore the number of people voluntarily requesting to join cooperatives is increasing day by day. Secondly, after the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party made a resolution to develop cooperatives this year, party conferences were held in all provinces to discuss and formulate plans for the development of cooperatives, and to publicize the benefits of cooperatives to herders, thus creating a high tide of herders joining cooperatives.

Baljinnyam pointed out that due to the increase in cooperatives, the settlement of herders is becoming increasingly important. Many cooperatives have entered a semi-settled state, changing their nomadic ways, grazing within a certain range, and beginning to engage in agriculture, store feed and hay, and build sheds. Some also have fixed buildings such as schools, clinics, and recreation rooms. Baljinnyam finally pointed out that much work remains to be done to fully settle herders. He said that due to the expansion of cooperatives, the current township governments will also undergo changes, potentially merging townships and cooperatives, and finally achieving complete settlement. He believes that all localities should formulate plans based on their specific circumstances and carry out this work in a step-by-step manner.

    蒙古牧业合作化大步前进
    到1960年全国将实现牧业合作化
    新华社乌兰巴托27日电  蒙古人民共和国牧业的社会主义改造工作在1958年取得了显著的成绩。蒙古农牧业部第一副部长巴尔吉尼雅姆今天在记者招待会上说，根据目前的发展速度看，到1960年全国可以全部实现牧业合作化。
    以今年9月1日的统计和1955年相比，入社牧户从二万五千户增加到十一万多户，入社牲畜和社员的自留牲畜从三百一十万头增加到一千四百四十六万多头。目前全国牧户的56％加入了合作社，入社牲畜和社员自留牲畜占总牲畜的61％多。
    今年蒙古合作社的发展规模和速度超过了过去任何一年。从入社牧户看1956年比1955年增加了二万四千户，1957年又增加了二万户，今年却比去年增加四万多户。
    巴尔吉尼雅姆说，牧业合作化的优越性主要表现在牲畜增殖方面，去年和今年合作社都超额完成了牲畜增殖计划。
    今年合作化速度发展较快的原因是牧民们看到了最近两年来合作社在增殖牲畜方面所表现的集体化的优越性，因此自愿要求加入合作社的人一天比一天多起来。其次，今年蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会作出发展合作社的决议后，各省都召开了党的会议，讨论和制订了发展合作社的规划，并且向牧民宣传合作社的好处，因而掀起了牧民入社的高潮。
    巴尔吉尼雅姆指出，由于合作社的增多，牧民的定居问题越来越重要了，许多合作社已经进入半定居状态，它们改变了游牧的方式，在一定范围内进行放牧，并开始经营农业，储备饲料和干草，搭盖棚圈。有的还有了学校、医务所和娱乐室等固定建筑。巴尔吉尼雅姆最后指出，要使牧民完全定居还要做很多工作。他说，由于合作社的扩大，现在的乡政权也将发生变化，有可能使乡社合一，最后达到完全定居。他认为，各地应根据具体情况制订规划，有步骤地进行这一工作。
