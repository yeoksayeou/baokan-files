    Taking Off Clothes to Warm Relatives
    In the evening, the northwest wind howled, and a torrential rain poured down, and the weather suddenly turned cold. At this time, all the comrades on the steel construction site of the Yangzhou Handicraft Cooperative were engaged in an intense battle. Some people were wearing only single layers of clothing and were shivering from the cold.
    Suddenly, the sound of gongs and drums came from the muddy road in front of the construction site. Behind the kerosene lamp closely followed a crowd of people carrying luggage. It turned out that when the strong wind and heavy rain struck, members of various handicraft cooperatives immediately launched a "take off clothes to warm relatives" upsurge. The sixty-three members of the shoe-making production cooperative alone took out seventy-eight pieces of clothing, including cotton-padded jackets, cotton-padded trousers, and sweaters. The members delivered all the clothes taken out to the construction site within half an hour.

    解衣暖亲人
    傍晚，西北风满天呼啸，阵雨倾盆而下，天气突然变冷。这时，扬州手工业社钢铁工地上的全体同志正在进行紧张的战斗。有人身上穿着单衣，冷得发抖。
    工地前边的泥泞大道上，忽然传来锣鼓声。在汽油灯的后面紧跟着挑行李包裹的人群。原来，当大风大雨袭来时，各手工业社的社员立即掀起一个“解衣暖亲人”的热潮。仅制鞋生产社的六十三个社员，就拿出棉袄、棉裤和绒衣等七十八件。社员们在半个小时内，就把大家拿出的衣服送到工地。
