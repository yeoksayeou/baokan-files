Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 9th. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party (PCF) yesterday issued a statement calling for a movement to renew party membership cards and strengthen the party.

    The statement emphatically pointed out that the support of the French working people has enabled the Communist Party to occupy the top position among French political forces. The French Communist Party remains a bastion of public freedom and a guarantee for the future restoration of a renewed democracy and a new republic governed by and for the people.

    The statement pointed out that eleven years of frantic anti-republicanism and six months of autocratic government have abolished any democratic supervision of the government by the people, but all this has not been able to affect the trust of conscious workers and democratic forces in the French Communist Party. The statement emphasized that at this moment when reactionary and fascist forces have developed somewhat and France is undergoing difficulties, the above fact has great political significance, making people believe that it is possible to defeat the conspiracies of the most reactionary forces.

    The statement then said that, considering the current situation, the French Communist Party will unswervingly defend freedom, defend the right of the working class to enjoy a deserved life, and defend peace and the independence of France.

    The statement pointed out that, being convinced that the true great future of France can only be guaranteed by a renewed democracy, the French Communist Party regards uniting workers and all democratic forces in the country as its task, so that this new republic can be born.

    The statement said that the Political Bureau believes that, in the current situation, it is urgently necessary to strengthen the ranks of the French Communist Party and to increase the number of party branches in rural areas, localities, and enterprises. To continuously improve the masses and activists of the French Communist Party, to organize forces capable of restoring and promoting a democratic society and taking action: this is an urgent task that no member of the French Communist Party can ignore.

    The statement concluded: The more communists and the more branches there are, the more it will greatly enable the struggle to continue and achieve partial victories, thereby ultimately leading to overall victory.

    法共政治局决定增强党的队伍
    团结工人和民主力量推进反法西斯斗争
    新华社巴黎9日电  法国共产党中央委员会政治局昨天发表一项文告，号召展开一次换发党证和加强党的运动。
    文告着重指出，法国劳动人民的支持使共产党得以在法国政治力量中居于首位。法国共产党仍然是公众自由的堡垒，是争取日后恢复革新后的民主和受到民治、民享的新共和国的保证。
    文告指出：十一年的疯狂反共和六个月的专制政府废弃了人民对政权的任何民主监督，但是这一切丝毫没有能够影响有觉悟的工人和民主力量对法国共产党的信任。文告强调说，在反动派和法西斯势力有所发展而法国正在经历着困难的这个时刻，上述事实有重大的政治意义，它使人们相信击败最反动的势力的阴谋诡计是可能的。
    文告接着说，考虑到目前的形势，法国共产党将坚持不渝地保卫自由、保卫劳动阶级享有应得的生活的权利、保卫和平和法国的独立。
    文告指出，由于确信法国的真正伟大前途只有革新后的民主才能予以保证，所以法国共产党把团结工人和全国一切民主力量作为自己的任务，以便使这个新共和国得以诞生。
    文告说，政治局认为，在目前形势下，迫切需要增强法国共产党的队伍，需要在农村、地方上和企业中增建党的支部。不断提高法国共产党的群众和它的积极分子，组织能够恢复和促进民主社会力量并且采取行动：这是法国共产党任何党员所不能忽视的迫切任务。
    文告最后说：共产党员的人数和支部越多，就越能大大使斗争再接再厉并且取得局部胜利，从而最后导向全盘的胜利。
