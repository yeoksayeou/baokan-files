	Is Traditional Chinese Medicine Scientific?
	——A Long-Standing Debate
	By our reporter Lü Xinchu

	Is Traditional Chinese Medicine scientific? This debate has been going on for a long time. For nearly a century, with the "arrival" of imperialist cultural aggression in our country, people infected with the "valuing foreign over domestic" ideology have labeled traditional Chinese medicine as "unscientific" and "backward." Since 1954, when the Party Central Committee emphasized the policy of inheriting and developing traditional Chinese medicine, this debate has become even more lively. Not only in meetings and in newspapers and magazines, but also in people's daily conversations, and more importantly, in practical medical work, this great debate is underway.

	Practice is the touchstone of truth. Whether traditional Chinese medicine is scientific or not depends first and foremost on whether it can cure diseases. Those who argue that "traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific" attack traditional Chinese medicine with the primary claim that it cannot cure diseases. Despite the many facts presented before them, they doubt that traditional Chinese medicine's success in treating diseases is accidental, saying that these diseases would get better even without treatment, just like "the sun rises when the rooster crows, and the sun rises even if the rooster doesn't crow." Under the light of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, a large number of treasures of traditional Chinese medicine have been unearthed. Many kinds of difficult and serious diseases, even those considered incurable by medical circles in various countries, have been cured by traditional Chinese medicine. Cancer, optic nerve atrophy, aplastic anemia, encephalitis, silicosis, acute appendicitis, etc., are all serious diseases that can be fatal or cause disability, and patients will not recover on their own, but some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have cured many such patients. However, those who argue that "traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific" still doubt whether the diagnosis of these diseases is correct. At a meeting of the surgery teaching and research group of a certain medical college, someone proposed that acute appendicitis could be treated with traditional Chinese medicine methods without surgery, which caused a burst of laughter. Later, experiments showed that traditional Chinese medicine did indeed cure many acute appendicitis patients with medication, but the director of this teaching and research group still did not believe it and secretly checked the medical records to see if there were any errors in the diagnosis. He thought, maybe it wasn't acute appendicitis? The diagnosis recorded on the medical records was indeed acute appendicitis, but he was still skeptical. Finally, he personally diagnosed and treated patients with traditional Chinese medicine methods, one after another successfully, curing a total of seven acute appendicitis patients. At this time, he was truly convinced.

	Although traditional Chinese medicine has definite curative effects on many diseases, some who argue that "traditional Chinese medicine is unscientific" still have one last trump card: traditional Chinese medicine has no theory, so it is still "unscientific." These people believe: "Traditional Chinese medicine cures diseases, but cannot explain why it can cure them, which is still 'unscientific'." They look down on the "four diagnostic methods and eight principal syndromes" and "six exogenous pathogenic factors and seven emotions" theories of traditional Chinese medicine the most. They say these are "metaphysics," "witchcraft," "superstition," and "idealism." Some Western-trained doctors who have studied traditional Chinese medicine and applied it in clinical treatment understand the yin-yang theory in this way: "Yin and yang" explain that everything has two opposing sides, so it contains elements of ancient, simple materialistic dialectics. The basic principle of traditional Chinese medicine in treating diseases is to support one's own resistance and promote the body's return to normal. Yin and yang are the general principles of the "eight principal syndromes" (yin, yang, exterior, interior, cold, heat, deficiency, and excess). The exterior, heat, and excess syndromes can be summarized by "yang," and the interior, cold, and deficiency syndromes can be summarized by "yin." The words "yin and yang" are used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine. They summarize the basic types of diseases. Although the types of human diseases are numerous, they generally cannot be separated from the two aspects of yin and yang. Yin and yang are also used to represent the state of disease, the progress or regression of the condition, the strength of resistance, and the state of mind. When traditional Chinese medicine practitioners see a patient, they first examine the patient's entire body condition, tongue coating, pulse, etc., to see whether the disease belongs to yin or yang. Therefore, they believe that the yin-yang and eight principal syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine, although they sound illusory and make people think of "geomancers," are actually reasonable.

	Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners say that many effective treatments in traditional Chinese medicine are carried out under the guidance of theories such as the four diagnostic methods and eight principal syndromes. Traditional Chinese medicine determines treatment plans based on theories such as "four diagnostic methods," "eight principal syndromes," and "six exogenous pathogenic factors and seven emotions." Traditional Chinese medicine believes that this is "syndrome differentiation and treatment" (the "syndrome" of traditional Chinese medicine refers to all clinical manifestations of the patient). Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine treats diseases from the perspective of the unity of the body and the specificity of the individual, rather than treating the head for a headache and the foot for a footache. Traditional Chinese medicine basically has certain prescriptions and treatments for various diseases. Some drugs and prescriptions have special effects on certain diseases, so there is "strict principle," which means that traditional Chinese medicine has general rules for treating diseases. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicine determines the yin, yang, exterior, interior, cold, heat, deficiency, and excess of the disease according to the four diagnostic methods, considering the unity and individual specificity of the human body and its relationship with the environment, thereby making changes to certain treatment plans. This is "high flexibility," but it is by no means infinitely variable and unpredictable. The combination of strict principle and high flexibility, general rules and special rules, is the basic spirit of "syndrome differentiation and treatment."

	In recent years, under the guidance of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, many cases created by Chinese and Western medical personnel in clinical practice are sufficient to refute the claim of those who discriminate against traditional Chinese medicine that traditional Chinese medicine has no theory. Liver cirrhosis is a disease that cannot be treated by medical circles in various countries, but in recent years, several traditional Chinese medicine treatment institutions have cured many such cases. The Eleventh Affiliated Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, under the guidance of the traditional Chinese medicine theory of "four diagnostic methods and eight principal syndromes," uses the treatment principle of "'tonifying' for deficiency and 'draining' for excess" to treat liver cirrhosis. For "excess syndrome," it adopts a prescription that first attacks and then tonifies; for "deficiency syndrome," it adopts a prescription that first tonifies and then attacks; for "deficiency with excess" or "excess with deficiency," it adopts a method that combines attack and tonification, using both of the above types of prescriptions. They used this treatment principle to treat ninety-four patients with ascites due to liver cirrhosis, with an effective rate of 78.6%. Similarly, it is Japanese encephalitis, but when it occurs in different people and in different environments, the treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine will also be changed to some extent on the basis of basic treatment methods. The remarkable curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine in treating Japanese encephalitis in recent years has been achieved under the guidance of the theory of "four diagnostic methods and eight principal syndromes." Medical institutions in Shijiazhuang used the Chinese medicine Baihu Decoction to treat Japanese encephalitis and achieved satisfactory results. Later, Beijing completely copied the treatment methods of Shijiazhuang, but the curative effect was not good. After detailed syndrome differentiation by Beijing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, it was found that the patients in Beijing with Japanese encephalitis were not completely the same as those in Shijiazhuang due to the individual specificity of the patients, the climate at the time of onset, and the geographical environment. Therefore, most patients were accompanied by dampness ("dampness" is one of the six exogenous pathogenic factors and belongs to yin evil). Based on this characteristic, Beijing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners changed the treatment method and achieved satisfactory results. A Western-trained doctor from the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class encountered such a case: a sick child suffered from diarrhea for nearly a month, more than ten times a day, but without obvious symptoms of dehydration, and stool culture was negative. After using various antibiotics without effect, it was later found after syndrome differentiation that the child had a thin and weak pulse, and his eyes were exposed when sleeping, indicating that his body was "deficient" and "the middle qi was insufficient." The treatment principle should be based on tonifying qi. A dose of single ginseng decoction cured the disease. Can these facts prove that the theory of traditional Chinese medicine is "idealistic" and "empty"?

	The meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine is also something that some people refer to as illusory. But like the "four diagnostic methods and eight principal syndromes," the "meridian theory" is an important theoretical basis for traditional Chinese medicine in treating diseases. Many people at home and abroad praise the miraculous efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture in treating diseases. Thirty-three countries are promoting Chinese acupuncture therapy. The acupuncture technique of traditional Chinese medicine is based on the meridian theory. Acupuncture points are distributed on certain meridians, so acupuncture is "selecting acupoints along the meridians." Yang Zaisheng, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Heying Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic in Lulong County, Hebei Province, cured two cases of bone tuberculosis with acupuncture. This was the result of "selecting acupoints along the meridians" and differentiating and treating according to the "yin-yang and eight principal syndromes" theory. When treating patient Dong Wenyue's knee joint tuberculosis, he selected several acupoints on the "Foot Taiyin Spleen Meridian" related to the lower right limb and the disease itself. At the same time, according to the "yin-yang and exterior-interior" of the disease, he selected acupoints on the "Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian" of the lower limbs. After ten acupuncture sessions, he was cured. The Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine treated a patient with left hypochondriac pain. Acupuncture at local acupoints at the site of pain failed to relieve the pain. Later, acupuncture was performed at "Zhigou" (on the wrist) of the "Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian" and "Yanglingquan" (in the fibula part below the knee) of the "Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian," and the pain stopped. These two meridians are related to the pain in the left hypochondrium. In other internal and surgical aspects, traditional Chinese medicine also applies the meridian theory. For example, symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, tinnitus, insomnia, fatigue, and memory loss are analyzed by traditional Chinese medicine as those that are liver meridian diseases, those that are heart meridian diseases, those that are diseases in both the heart and spleen meridians, those that are diseases in both the liver and kidney meridians, etc., and thus there are many treatment methods, all of which come from the meridian theory. A Soviet friend in Beijing, Yevseyeva, suffered from chest tightness and pain, which was connected to soreness in her left arm that could not be lifted. She was first diagnosed with heart disease by modern scientific instruments, and then diagnosed by Qin Bowei, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, as arm spasm syndrome of the Hand Shaoyin Heart Meridian, which was consistent with the diagnosis of Western medicine. The disease was quickly relieved with the addition and subtraction of Chinese medicine roasted licorice decoction. Recently, after the invention of the "meridian measurement instrument" that uses modern scientific methods to test meridians, it can be preliminarily proved that meridians are likely to be objective existences, not just assumptions without scientific basis. The Acupuncture Research Institute of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is studying the use of acupuncture measurement instruments to help diagnose diseases. They use the meridian measurement instrument to measure the meridian lesions, which often coincide with the diagnostic results of traditional Chinese medicine based on the four diagnostic methods and eight principal syndromes theory. For example, patient Hu Pengfei suffered from headaches and stomach pains for many years. According to the patient's white and yellow tongue coating and the wiry and weak pulse, traditional Chinese medicine diagnosed him as yang deficiency and liver excess. The results of measuring the patient's meridians with a meridian measurement instrument showed that the electric current of the Foot Yinming Stomach Meridian was particularly weak, which was a manifestation of stomach meridian weakness (this meridian passes through the stomach); the electric intensity of the large intestine meridian and the small intestine meridian (each meridian is symmetrical from left to right), which are related to the stomach, was very unbalanced; it was also found that the kidney and bladder meridians were also unbalanced, which was proof of yin deficiency and liver excess.

	Some people believe that traditional Chinese medicine does have many things that are known but not understood, and there may be many incorrect understandings and many aspects that are not as good as Western medicine, and even some superstitious elements. However, this cannot be used to conclude that traditional Chinese medicine is not a science. Western medicine also has things that are known but not understood, things that are unclear and wrong, and many aspects that are not as good as traditional Chinese medicine, and of course, it cannot be said that Western medicine is unscientific because of this. Many people believe that traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Like all other natural sciences, it cannot be said that they have completely and correctly understood all the secrets and laws of nature; they can explain all natural phenomena clearly. Every natural science is constantly developing. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine need to be developed together, need to be combined, need to learn from each other, and need to improve together. Western medicine is based on modern science and technology, which traditional Chinese medicine lacks. Therefore, to summarize and improve the experience of traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine must participate. Therefore, today there is a special need for Western-trained doctors who have mastered modern science and technology to study traditional Chinese medicine.

	Now, many people say that the facts have proved the correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine; they have proved the brilliant correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion that "Chinese medicine and pharmacology is a great treasure house"; the integration of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine into a new Chinese medicine pointed out by the Party is the most correct direction for the development of China's medical and health undertakings.

    中医科学不科学？ 
    ——一场由来已久的辩论
    本报记者  吕新初
    中医科学不科学？这一场辩论由来已久。近百年来，随着帝国主义文化侵略的“光临”我国，沾染了
  “重洋轻土”思想的人们就给中医学术戴上了“不科学”、“落后”的帽子。1954年，党中央强调了继承和发扬祖国医学的中医政策以后，这场辩论越加生动活泼起来。不光是在会议上，在报章杂志上，而且在人们日常生活的闲谈中，更重要的是在实际医疗工作中，都在进行着这场大辩论。
    实践是真理的试金石。中医科学不科学，首先看它能不能治好病。“中医不科学”论者攻击中医的第一张牌，就是说中医治不好病。尽管许多事实放在面前，他们也怀疑中医看好病是偶然，说这些病不看也能好，正像“鸡叫了天亮，鸡不叫天也亮”一样。在党的中医政策照耀下，中医的宝藏被大批地发掘出来。许多种疑难重症甚至各国医学界认为不治之症被中医治好了。癌肿、视神经萎缩、再生障碍性贫血、脑炎、矽肺、急性阑尾炎等，都是可以致死或造成残废的重症，病人自己是不会好的，而有些中医却治好了不少这样的病人。然而“中医不科学”论者还要怀疑这些疾病的诊断是否正确。在某医学院外科教研组的一次会议上，有人提出用中医方法治疗急性阑尾炎可以不开刀，引起了哄堂大笑。后来实验结果，中医确实用服药方法治好了不少急性阑尾炎病人，但这个教研组主任仍不相信，偷偷地查阅病历，看看诊断有没有错，他想，也许并不是急性阑尾炎吧？病案上记载的诊断确实是急性阑尾炎，然而他还是将信将疑，最后他亲自诊断，用中医方法医疗，一个接着一个地成功了，一共治愈了七个急性阑尾炎患者，这时他真正信服了。
    虽然中医对不少疾病疗效确切，但是一些“中医不科学”论者还有最后一张王牌：中医没有理论，因此还是“不科学”。这些人认为：“中医治好了病，但说不出为什么能治好，这仍然是‘不科学’”。他们最瞧不起中医的“四诊八纲”“六淫七情”等理论。他们说这是“玄学”，是“巫术”，是“迷信”，是“唯心”的。一些学过中医并且在临床上应用了中医治疗的西医师们这样理解阴阳学说：“阴阳”说明了一切事物都具有对立的两面，所以是包含着古代朴素的唯物辩证法的成分的。中医治病的基本原则是扶植自身的抵抗力，促使机体恢复正常。阴阳是“八纲”（阴阳、表里、寒热、虚实）中的总纲，表、热、实三纲可以用“阳”来概括，里、寒、虚三纲可以用“阴”来概括。中医学术中“阴阳”两字的用途很广泛，它们概括了疾病的基本类型，人的疾病尽管种类繁多，总的说来离不了阴阳两个方面；阴阳也用来代表病态的动静、病情的进退、抵抗力的强弱、精神的好坏等。中医看病，首先审察病人的整个机体的病状、舌苔、脉象等，看出疾病属阴还是属阳。所以他们认为中医的阴阳八纲虽然听起来好像虚无缥缈，使人们想到“阴阳先生”，其实是有道理的。
    中医师们说，中医的许多疗效卓著的治疗方法，就是在四诊八纲等理论指导下进行的。中医根据“四诊”“八纲”“六淫七情”等理论确定治病方案，中医认为这是“辨证论治”（中医的“证”是指病人的一切临床表现）。因此中医看病是从机体的统一性和个体的特异性来考虑，而不是头痛医头，脚痛医脚。中医对于各种病症基本上各有一定的处方和治法，有些药物和处方对于某种疾病有特效，所以是有“严正的原则性”的，这就是说中医治病是有一般规律的。另一方面，中医根据四诊来确定病体的阴阳表里寒热虚实，考虑人体的统一性和个体特异性及其与环境的关系，从而在一定的治疗方案上加以变化，这又是“高度的灵活性”，但决不是变化无穷，不可捉摸。严正的原则性和高度的灵活性，一般规律和特殊规律相结合，就是“辨证论治”的基本精神。
    近年来在党的中医政策的指导下，不少中西医务人员在临床实践中创造出来的许多事例足以驳斥歧视中医的人们所谓中医没有理论的说法。肝硬化是各国医界无法治疗的疾病，但近年来有几个中医治疗机构治好了许多这种病例。上海中医学院附属第十一医院在中医“四诊八纲”理论的指导下，用“‘虚’则补之，‘实’则泄之”的治疗原则治疗肝硬化，对于“实证”，采取先攻后补的处方；对于“虚”证，采取先补后攻的处方；对于“虚中兼实”、“实中兼虚”的，采取攻补兼施法，兼用上述两类处方。他们用这个治疗原则治疗了九十四个肝硬化腹水病人，有效率达到78.6％。同样是乙型脑炎，但是它发生在不同人的身上和不同的环境中，中医的治疗方法也就在基本的治疗方法上有所改变。近年来中医治疗乙型脑炎的卓越疗效就是在“四诊八纲”的理论指导下取得的。石家庄的医疗机构用中药白虎汤治疗乙型脑炎收到满意的结果，后来北京把石家庄的治疗方法全套搬用过来，疗效却并不好，经过北京中医师详细辨证，发现北京的乙型脑炎病人由于病人的个体特异性、发病时的气候以及地理环境都和石家庄不完全相同，因此病人多半挟湿（“湿”是六淫之一，属于阴邪）。根据这个特点，北京的中医师们改变疗法，就得到了满意的疗效。上海中医研究班的西医师曾碰到这样一个病例，一个病孩患腹泄近一个月，一天十多次，但没有明显失水症状，大便培养是阴性。经用各种抗菌素都无效，后来经辨证后发现这个病儿脉细弱，睡时露睛，是体“虚”、“中气不足”，治疗原则应该以补气为主，开了一味独参汤，就把病治好了。这些事实难道能说明中医的理论是“唯心”的“虚玄”的吗？
    中医的经络学说，也是被有些人指为虚无缥缈的东西。但是正像“四诊八纲”一样，“经络学说”是中医治病的一项重要理论根据。国内外很多人都赞扬中医针灸治病的奇功卓效。有三十三个国家在推行中国针灸疗法。中医的针灸技术就是以经络学说为理论根据的。针灸的穴道都是分布在一定经络上的，所以针灸是“循经取穴”。河北省卢龙县河营中医杨再生用针灸治愈两例骨结核，就是“循经取穴”同时根据“阴阳八纲”理论辨证施治的结果。他在治疗病人董文钺的膝关节结核的时候，采取了右下肢部分和本病有关的经络——“足太阴脾经”的几个穴道，同时按病症的“阴阳表里”采取了下肢的“足阳明胃经”上的穴道，针了十次，就治愈。上海中医学院治疗一个左侧胁痛患者，在痛处局部穴道针灸，未能止痛，后来又针“手少阳三焦经”的“支沟”（在手腕部）及“足少阳胆经”的“阳陵泉”（在膝下腓骨部分）两个穴道，疼痛就停止了。这两道经络都是和左侧胁的病痛有关的。其他内外科方面，中医也都应用着经络学说。如头晕、心跳、耳鸣、失眠、疲劳、记忆力衰退等症状，中医分析为那些是肝经病，那些是心经病，那些是病在心脾两经，那些是病在肝肾两经，等等，从而有多种治法，这都是从经络学说来的。在北京的苏联友人叶尼谢也娃患胸区胀闷作痛，牵连左手臂酸痛不能抬举，先经现代科学仪器诊断为心脏病，后经北京中医学院中医师秦伯未诊治，认为是手少阴心经的臂厥症，和西医的诊断相符合，用中药炙甘草汤加减，四剂其病顿失。近来发明了用现代科学方法测验经络的“经络测定仪”以后，更可以初步证明经络很可能是客观存在的东西，并不是毫无科学根据的假设。中医研究院针灸研究所正在研究用针灸测定仪帮助诊断疾病。他们用经络测定仪测定经络病变的情况常常和中医根据四诊八纲理论诊断结果相符合。例如病人胡鹏飞患头疼、胃痛多年，中医根据病人舌苔白黄、脉象玄而无力等证候，诊断为阳虚肝旺。用经络测定仪测定病人经络的结果，发现足阴明胃经的电流量特别弱，是胃经虚弱的表现（这条经络是通过胃脏的）；与胃脏有关的大肠经、小肠经（每条经络都是左右对称的），电强度很不平衡；又发现肾与膀胱经也不平衡，这是阴虚肝旺的证明。
    有些人认为，中医的确有许多知其然而不知其所以然的地方，还可能有不少错误的认识，也有许多不及西医的地方，甚至有迷信的成分。但是不能因此认为中医学术就不是一门科学。西医同样有知其然而不知其所以然的地方，有不明了和错误的东西，并且有不少比不上中医的地方，当然同样不能因此而说西医不科学。许多人认为：中西医各有所长，也各有缺点，正像其他一切自然科学一样，不能说对于自然界一切秘密和规律已经完全正确地认识；对一切自然现象都能解释清楚，每门自然科学都是在不断发展着的。因此中西医需要并举，需要结合，需要互相学习，共同提高。西医是建立在现代科学技术的基础上的，这是中医所缺乏的，因此总结和提高中医学术经验，必须有西医参加，所以今天特别需要掌握现代科学技术的西医来学习中医。
    现在，许多人这样说，事实证明了党的中医政策的正确；证明了毛主席的“中国医药学是一个伟大的宝库”这一论断的英明正确；党所指出的中西医学要化合成一个中国的新医学，就是中国医疗卫生事业最正确的发展方向。
