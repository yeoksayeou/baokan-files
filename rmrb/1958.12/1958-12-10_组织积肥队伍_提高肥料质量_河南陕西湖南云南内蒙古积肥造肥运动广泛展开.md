Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 9th: Henan Province, in its manure collection campaign, has adopted a "walking on two legs" approach to vigorously promote both natural farm manure and locally-produced chemical fertilizers. Currently, over two trillion jin of soil fertilizer has been collected, accounting for 29% of the plan. 34.5 billion jin of locally-produced chemical fertilizer has been produced, exceeding the original plan by nearly seven times. This lays a solid foundation for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

Party committees at all levels in Henan Province attach great importance to manure collection work, treating fertilizer work as a strategic measure for increasing production. Party committees at all levels have designated responsible cadres to specifically oversee this work. From the special districts to the counties, manure collection offices have been established to be responsible for organization and inspection. The people's communes have established specialized manure collection teams and local chemical fertilizer factories. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 100,000 local chemical fertilizer factories, more than 45,000 bacterial fertilizer factories, and more than 89,000 granular fertilizer factories throughout the province. In order to quickly improve the quality of manure collection, in addition to timely convening on-site meetings to learn and exchange techniques, party committees at all levels have specially trained 160,000 technicians; they have also concentrated a large number of laborers to organize specialized soil fertilizer collection teams, requiring guarantees of quantity and quality. Various regions have also created many manure collection methods in light of local conditions. In the northern Henan region and the Funiu Mountains area, a "thousand mu, hundred ponds" campaign has been widely launched to compost fertilizer on the spot and apply it on the spot. Many regions have implemented eight digging activities, including digging wall soil, digging cooking stoves, digging livestock pens, digging millstones, digging chicken coops, digging pigsties, and digging sheepfolds. Local chemical fertilizers, etc., are even more diverse. Currently, the province produces more than 150 kinds of various local chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, and granular fertilizers, totaling more than 41.86 million tons.

This newspaper, Xi'an, December 9th: Shaanxi Province, led by the Party committee secretaries, is actively mobilizing the masses, criticizing the "wait-and-see" faction, and launching a massive winter manure collection campaign.

At present, the people's communes throughout the province have successively adjusted their labor forces, organized professional teams, and launched manure collection campaigns. In Chang'an County, where the movement is progressing relatively quickly, according to a six-day statistic in mid-November, 2.24 billion jin of manure was collected.

When various localities proposed to launch a manure collection campaign, they encountered ideological obstacles from some people, the most important of which was conservative backward thinking. Party committees of the various communes actively mobilized the masses, and through the calculation of three accounts (fertilizer source account, labor account, fertilizer application increase account), they criticized various erroneous ideas and improved the masses' understanding of the manure collection campaign. After debating the manure collection issue, the Five-Star People's Commune in Chang'an County immediately mobilized the masses to find ways to solve labor and fertilizer source problems, refuting the various arguments of the "wait-and-see" faction with facts.

In order to ensure the quality of fertilizers, various localities have taken many measures. For example, educating the masses participating in manure collection on fertilizer standards; formulating an acceptance system for fertilizers; collecting and storing farmyard manure, human excrement, grass ash, and chicken and duck manure separately; and strengthening leadership in the production of local chemical fertilizers, paying attention to the development of local chemical fertilizer production. Various regions are also paying attention to adopting the methods of composting and smoking fertilizers on the spot. Counties such as Jingbian and Yan'an have universally dug composting pits and smoking fertilizer towers in the fields and along the edges of the land.

This newspaper reports: Hunan Province has adopted the methods of establishing specialized manure collection teams, engaging in small-scale work during the busy farming season and large-scale work during the slack season, accumulating fertilizer on mountains, and building composting ponds in the fields to carry out a year-round manure collection campaign. According to statistics on the 3rd, more than 6 billion dan of farm manure was collected in just over a month.

The characteristics of this year's manure collection are: combining group operations with specialized teams, and combining year-round manure collection with shock manure collection. Everywhere there are seas of fertilizer, mountains of manure, and large ponds in the fields, the scale of manure collection is unprecedentedly huge. This is a new situation that has emerged from the combination of deep plowing and the requirement for large-scale fertilization. The people's communes in the Xiangtan Special District have already established more than 80,000 large field ponds, each pond storing about 10,000 dan of fertilizer, which the masses call "fertilizer reservoirs." Some people's communes in Hengyang, Chenxian and other special districts organized professional teams to use the past small mountain ponds to accumulate fertilizer on the mountains, and large-scale composting fertilizers. After the fertilizer is composted, it flows to the paddy fields by itself. The masses call it "manure lake and urine sea."

Various localities have adopted many new methods of accumulating and producing fertilizer. Counties such as Hengshan, Xiangyin, and Xinning, have combined deep plowing to promote field ditch smoking soil method, smoking and burning field soil to improve soil quality and increase fertilizer content. Pingjiang County has adopted eight combined manure collection methods such as insect removal combined with composting, large-scale water conservancy construction combined with picking pond mud, deep plowing soaking winter fields combined with stepping on green manure, logging combined with burning soil ash, and sweet potato processing combined with composting stinky water ponds. The county's 972 manure collection professional teams have collected more than 400 million dan of manure in the past month.

In addition, many places have made technical revolutions in manure collection to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor.

This newspaper, Kunming, December 9th: The people's communes in Yunnan Province have organized more than 300,000 laborers to launch a winter manure collection campaign.

The people's communes in Yuxi, Wenshan, Qujing, Chuxiong and other special districts have transferred a certain number of laborers to form a professional manure collection team, and adopted the method of combining professional teams with mass manure collection to carry out the manure collection campaign. At present, various places are actively looking for green manure, grass coal, seaweed, old wall soil, gutter mud, human and animal manure, and local chemical fertilizer and other fertilizer sources.

In order to improve the quality of fertilizer, many communes accumulate large amounts of human and animal manure, and universally set up manure ponds in the fields and livestock sheds beside the fields. In Fumin County, one field manure pond is set up for every ten mu of land. More than 1,000 manure ponds have now been dug, and more than 1,800 temporary toilets have been built beside the fields, accumulating a total of 280 million jin of human and animal manure. The people's communes in Yuanjiang, Binchuan, Songming, Yuanyang, Yuxi, and Jianshui counties have also combined the development of livestock to increase fertilizer sources, and promoted the method of dedicated personnel to manage livestock, diligently bedding the stables, and diligently producing fertilizer, to increase the amount of farmyard manure.

The communes in various regions have adopted the method of taking materials locally and manufacturing locally, and have opened many local chemical fertilizer factories. In Binchuan County, 73 local chemical fertilizer factories and bacterial fertilizer factories were built in more than a month. These factories used local methods to produce 12 kinds of local chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers.

In order to save labor for transporting fertilizers, in addition to promoting on-site manure collection, on-site composting, and on-site application of fertilizers, some communes have vigorously improved transportation tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 9th: Rural and pastoral areas in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are carrying out a manure collection campaign.

The Ongniud Banner in Zhaowuda League has adopted various measures to promote manure collection work. The commune has established chemical fertilizer factories, the production team has established manure yards, and there are full-time manure collectors. Every household has a manure pit, and they are tapping fertilizer sources from all aspects. Three leagues of Jerim, Zhaowuda, and Ulanqab have built a total of more than 23,700 local chemical fertilizer factories, producing a large amount of local chemical fertilizer.

In order to ensure the realization of the principle of "less planting, high yield, and more harvest," the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are very enthusiastic in their work such as autumn cultivation, deep plowing, manure accumulation and fertilizer delivery, overcoming many difficulties, and achieving great results. According to statistics as of November 20, the region has accumulated more than 300 billion jin of fertilizer and manufactured more than 1.6 billion jin of local chemical fertilizer. Now we are continuing to try every means to overcome the difficulties of transporting and applying fertilizer. The Jerim League is vigorously promoting sleds, ice boats, and skiing and skating tools, and mobilizing the masses to repair ice roads, striving to deliver all the manure to the fields before the thaw in the coming winter and spring.

    组织积肥队伍  提高肥料质量
    河南陕西湖南云南内蒙古积肥造肥运动广泛展开
    据新华社郑州9日电  河南省在积肥运动中，采用“两条腿走路”的办法大抓农家自然肥料和土化学肥料。现在已积土肥二万多亿斤，占计划的29％。土制化肥三百四十五亿斤，超过原来计划近七倍。这给明年小麦丰收打下有力的基础。
    河南省各级党委都很重视积肥工作，把肥料工作当作增产的战略措施来抓，各级党委都确定负责干部专门抓这一工作。从专区到县都成立了积肥办公室，负责组织检查。各人民公社成立了积肥专业队和土化肥工厂。现在全省据不完全统计，已有土化肥工厂十万多个，细菌肥料厂四万五千多个，颗粒肥料厂八万九千多个。为了很快地提高积肥质量，各级党委除了及时的召开现场会学习交流技术外，特别训练了十六万名技术员；还集中了大批劳力，组织积土肥专业队，要求保证数量和质量。各地还因地制宜地创造了很多积肥办法。豫北地区和伏牛山区，普遍开展了“千亩百池”运动，就地沤肥就地施用。好多地区实行了挖墙土、挖锅灶、挖牲口圈、挖磨道、挖鸡窝、挖猪圈、挖羊圈等八挖活动。土制化肥等更是百花齐放，现在全省生产各种土化肥、细菌肥料和颗粒肥料等共达一百五十余种，四千一百八十六万吨。
    本报西安9日电  陕西省各地由党委书记挂帅，积极发动群众，批判观潮派，展开声势浩大的冬季积肥运动。
    目前全省各人民公社都相继调整了劳动力，组织了专业队，开展积肥运动。运动进展比较快的长安县，据11月中旬六天的统计，就积肥二十二亿四千多万斤。
    当各地提出开展积肥运动时，遇到了一些人的思想障碍，其中最主要的是保守落后思想。各公社党委都积极发动群众，通过算三笔账（肥源账、劳力账、施肥增产账），批判了各种错误思想，提高了群众对积肥运动的认识。长安县五星人民公社在辩论积肥问题之后，立即发动群众想办法解决劳力和肥源等问题，用事实驳倒了“观潮派”的各种论调。
    为了保证肥料的质量，各地采取了很多措施。例如对参加积肥的群众进行肥料标准的教育；制定对肥料的验收制度；分别搜集和保管厩肥、人粪尿、草木灰、鸡鸭粪；并加强对土化肥生产的领导，注意发展土化肥的生产。各地还注意采取就地沤肥、熏肥的方法。靖边、延安等县在田头地边普遍挖好了沤肥坑和熏肥塔。
    本报讯  湖南各地采取建立积肥专业队，农忙小干农闲大干，座山积肥，田头沤氹的办法，开展常年积肥运动。到3日统计，仅仅一个多月就积农家肥料六十多亿担。
    今年积肥的特点是：兵团作战与专业队相结合，常年积肥与突击积肥相结合。到处是肥海粪山和田边大氹，积肥规模空前巨大。这是深耕要求结合大量施肥所出现的一种新情况。湘潭专区各人民公社已在田头建立田间大氹八万多个，每个大氹储肥料万担左右，群众叫做“肥料库”。衡阳、郴县等专区有些人民公社组织专业队，利用过去的小山塘座山积肥，大规模地沤制肥料，肥料沤好后，自流到稻田里，群众叫做“粪湖尿海”。
    各地采取了许多新的积肥造肥的方法。衡山、湘阴、新宁等县，都结合深耕推行田间沟道熏土法，熏烧田泥改良土质增加肥分。平江县采取除虫结合做堆肥、大修水利结合挑塘泥、深耕浸冬田结合踩青、伐木结合烧火土灰、红薯加工结合沤臭水氹等八结合的积肥方法，全县九百七十二个积肥专业队最近一个月已积肥四亿多担。
    此外，很多地方在积肥中大闹技术革命，解决劳力不足的困难。
    本报昆明9日电  云南省各地人民公社已组织三十多万个劳动力展开冬季积肥运动。
    玉溪、文山、曲靖、楚雄等专区的人民公社，抽调了一定数量的劳动力组成积肥的专业队伍，采取专业队与群众性积肥结合的方法开展积肥运动。目前，各地正积极寻找绿肥、草煤、海草、老墙土、阴沟泥、人畜肥、土化肥等肥源。
    为了提高肥料的质量，许多公社大积人畜肥，普遍在田间设粪塘，田边建畜厩。富民县十亩田设一个田间粪塘，现已挖粪塘一千多个，同时在田边搭了一千八百多个临时厕所，共积人畜肥二亿八千万斤。元江、宾川、嵩明、元阳、玉溪、建水等县的人民公社，并结合发展牲畜增加肥源，同时推广专人管理牲畜、勤垫厩勤出肥的办法，增加厩肥量。
    各地公社采取就地取材、就地制造的办法，开办了许多土化肥厂。宾川县在一个多月的时间内，就建起了七十三个土化肥厂和细菌肥料厂。这些工厂用土法生产出十二种土化肥和细菌肥料。
    为了节省运输肥料的劳动力，有些公社除了推广就地积肥、就地沤肥和就地施肥的办法外，并大力改良运输工具。
    据新华社呼和浩特9日电  内蒙古自治区农村、牧区正在开展积肥运动。
    昭乌达盟翁牛特旗采取各种措施推动积肥工作，公社建立了化肥厂，生产队建立了大粪场，并设有专职积肥员，家家户户有积肥坑，从各方面去挖掘肥源。哲里木、昭乌达、乌兰察布三个盟共已建起二万三千七百多个土化菌肥厂，生产出了大量的土化肥。
    内蒙古自治区各族人民为了保证实现“少种、高产、多收”的方针，在秋耕深翻、积肥送粪等工作上，干劲很高，克服许多困难，取得很大成绩。根据到11月20日的统计，全区已积肥三千多亿斤，制造土化肥十六亿多斤。现在正在继续千方百计克服运肥施肥的困难，哲里木盟正在大搞爬犁、冰船和滑雪滑冰工具，并发动群众修冰道，争取今冬明春解冻以前把粪全部送到地里。
