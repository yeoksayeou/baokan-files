Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: In 1958, on China's vast oceans and spiderweb-like rivers, large and small vessels were bustling about for steel transportation and industrial and agricultural production. This year, the national waterway freight volume will reach 210 million tons, an increase of 37% compared to last year, greatly exceeding the average annual growth rate of 25% during the first Five-Year Plan period.

The great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, especially the rapid development of the steel industry after the Beidaihe Conference, brought unprecedentedly heavy tasks to waterway transportation. In order to alleviate the transportation burden on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Tianjin-Pukou railways, since October, northern coastal areas have been responsible for transporting steel and coal for power industries to areas south of the Yangtze River, reaching one to two million tons per month, several times more than the same period last year. The monthly consignment volume of local shipping has also increased by tens of percent, or even doubled. Thanks to the strengthened leadership of local Party committees, the vigorous mass movement, and the booming technical revolution and communist collaboration, the water transport capacity has rapidly increased. For example, the freight volume on the Shanghai-northward sea transport line in December increased by more than 80% compared to August, basically ensuring the completion of steel production and other important material transportation tasks.

The vast number of water transport workers have displayed unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity, racking their brains to come up with various methods to fully unleash the potential of ships. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau and the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau alone increased horsepower by 47,000 horsepower after tapping potential, accounting for 34.5% of the original ship horsepower, and increased deadweight by 74,000 tons, accounting for 12.4% of the original ship tonnage. Hubei Province promoted the method of "rudderless pushing" and "iron-wood mixed formation" in inland rivers, solving the difficulties of wooden boats not being able to push and the shortage of barges, increasing the carrying capacity by half to one time. The transportation of barges and wooden rafts by cargo ships at sea has been successfully tested in the northern coastal areas this year. The sailing speed of ships has generally increased, and the schedules have been shortened. The "Democracy No. 12" ship sailing from Dalian to Shanghai used to take ten days for one trip at the beginning of this year, but now it only takes five days.

With the deepening of the technical revolution movement, many new creations and improvements have also emerged in ship technology. The 601 tugboat sailing on the Yangtze River created a remote control device that combines the two tasks of controlling the engine and driving, allowing crew members to operate the entire fleet from the bow of the barge far away from the tugboat by pressing a button. This is of great significance for water transport. The ships under the Shanghai Maritime Bureau are promoting the advanced experience of automating six tasks, including coal loading, oil filling, steering, rust removal, hatch covering, and cable handling, as well as the versatile skills of crew members, which has also greatly saved manpower, improved work efficiency, and further ensured safe transportation.

The wooden sailboats passed down by our ancestors have also changed their appearance in this year's great leap forward. Jiangsu, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Anhui and other places have made many reforms to the hull type and power of wooden sailboats. Sichuan Province has introduced a "seven-in-one" wooden sailboat, which concentrates the advantages of seven types of boats, so the boat has light weight, small resistance, shallow draft, large cargo capacity, and is safe. Hunan Province has created a "eight-sided sail" wooden sailboat, which can use wind power to sail in any wind direction. There has also been new development in the mechanization and semi-mechanization of wooden sailboats. 80% of the wooden sailboats under 20 tons in Jiangsu Province have been installed with semi-mechanized foot-operated or hand-cranked water turning devices, which not only greatly improves transportation capacity, but also saves the labor of boatmen. All the wooden boats of the Dongfanghong Wooden Sailboat Cooperative in Huangmei County, Hubei Province, have been equipped with power machines this year.

In completing this year's water transport tasks, the staff of ports, shipyards, and waterways have made outstanding contributions. From September to December, the throughput of major coastal ports such as Shanghai, Dalian, and Qinhuangdao increased by about one time compared to the same period last year.

### 水上“先行”各路报喜  全国水路货运量比去年猛增37％

    水上“先行”各路报喜
    全国水路货运量比去年猛增37％
    新华社25日讯  1958年，在我国辽阔的海洋和密如蛛网的江河上，大小船只都为钢铁运输和工农业生产而奔忙。这一年，全国水路货运量将达到两亿一千万吨，较去年增长37％，大大地超过了第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长25％的速度。
    全国工农业生产的大跃进，特别是北戴河会议以后钢铁工业的飞跃发展，给水路运输带来了空前未有的繁重任务。为了减轻京广和津浦两条铁路运输的负担，自10月份以来，我国北方沿海每月担负供应长江以南地区钢铁和动力工业用煤的运输量，都达到一百几十万吨，超过去年同时期几倍。地方航运每月的托运量也是百分之几十以至成倍地增长。由于各地党委加强领导，大搞群众运动，开展轰轰烈烈的技术革命和共产主义大协作，使水上运输能力迅速地增长，如上海以北海上运输干线12月份的货运量，就比8月份增长80％以上，基本上保证了钢铁生产和其他重要物资运输任务的完成。
    广大水运职工发挥了前所未有的积极性和创造性，千方百计地想出各种办法，充分地发挥了船舶的潜力。仅上海海运局和长江航运局经过挖掘潜力后，增加了马力四万七千匹，为原有船只马力的34.5％，载重量增加七万四千吨，为原有船只吨位的12.4％。湖北省在内河推行“无舵顶推”和“铁木混合编队”的办法，解决了木船不能顶推和驳船不足的困难，载重量提高半倍到一倍。在海上用货轮拖驳船和木排运输，今年已在北方沿海试验成功。船舶的航行速度普遍提高，班期缩短。航行在大连到上海的“民主十二号”轮船，今年年初跑一班需要十天，现在五天就行了。
  随着技术革命运动的深入开展，船舶在技术上也出现了许多新的创造和改进。航行在长江上的六零一拖轮创造了一种把操纵轮机和驾驶两项工作合而为一的遥控装置，使船员可以在远离拖轮的驳船船头，按电钮操纵整个船队。这对水上运输具有重大的意义。上海海运局所属船舶正在推行加煤、加油、操舵、除锈、盖舱、带缆等六项工作自动化和船员多面手的先进经验，也大大地节省了人力，提高了工作效率和进一步保证了安全运输。
    我们祖祖辈辈传下来的木帆船，今年在大跃进中也改变了它的面貌。江苏、湖南、四川、广东、安徽等地方，都对木帆船的船型和动力等方面作了许多改革。四川省出现一种“七合一”的木帆船，把七种船的优点都集中在一起，因而船的自重轻、阻力小、吃水浅、载货多，并且安全。湖南省创造一种“八面风帆”的木帆船，船舶在任何风向中都可以借助风力航行。木帆船机械化和半机械化也有了新的发展。江苏省二十吨以下的木帆船80％都安装了半机械化的脚踏或手摇的翻水板装置，不仅大大地提高了运输能力，而且节省了船工的劳动。湖北省黄梅县东方红木帆船合作社今年全部木船都装上了动力机器。
    在完成今年水上运输任务中，港口、修船厂和航道等方面的职工，都做出了突出的贡献。9月到12月，上海、大连、秦皇岛等沿海主要港口的吞吐量，都比去年同期增长一倍左右。
