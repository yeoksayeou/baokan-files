Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 7th: The First Ministry of Machine Building convened a foundry machinery professional conference in Tianjin in late November. The conference decided to fully mobilize the masses, combine indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous mechanization as the main approach, and vigorously promote technical revolution, so as to achieve mechanization of foundry work, the weakest link in the machinery industry, in the short term.

In the past, many people believed that to mechanize a foundry workshop, it had to be like the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, with conveyor belts seven or eight layers above and below ground, requiring investment, design, equipment, and engineers. Others, considered authorities, believed that foundry workshops with an annual output of less than 5,000 tons should not be mechanized. These arguments hindered the progress of foundry mechanization. During the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, foundry workers in many factories, displaying a daring and proactive communist spirit, actively implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main approach, building indigenous machines and vigorously promoting foundry mechanization, resulting in preliminary changes to the situation of manual operation. For example, in Tianjin's Hebei District, the mechanization of foundry work using indigenous methods increased production efficiency by five to eight times. Generally speaking, after achieving mechanization, labor productivity and the unit area output of the molding shop can be increased by three to five times. However, some people still believe that indigenous methods are inferior to foreign methods and that indigenous methods should eventually be replaced by foreign methods; others, while acknowledging the merits of indigenous methods, believe that they are only suitable for small factories.

In order to break down all kinds of conservative thinking, the conference introduced the experience of Tianjin No. 9 Plumbing Equipment Factory and other units in indigenous mechanization, and organized representatives to visit factories such as No. 9 Plumbing Equipment Factory, Dazhong Iron Factory, and Textile Machinery Factory for on-site inspections. After the start of the Great Leap Forward, No. 9 Plumbing Equipment Factory extensively mobilized the masses to carry out a campaign of everyone contributing ideas and plans. Within two months, they manufactured iron cutting machines, cupola charging machines, molding machines, vertical closed-loop foundry conveyors, and other equipment, basically achieving mechanization.

Through introductions, visits, and group discussions, the representatives liberated their thinking, broke down superstitions, and shattered the outdated view that small and medium-sized foundries should not implement mechanization. Everyone agreed that, focusing on production and current weak links, fully mobilizing the masses, implementing a combination of indigenous and foreign methods with indigenous methods as the main approach, and vigorously promoting mechanization, is the path to foundry mechanization in our country.

    突破机械跃进第一关
    一机部提出短期内实现铸工机械化
    据新华社天津7日电  第一机械工业部11月下旬在天津召开了铸造机械专业会议，决定充分发动群众，土洋结合，以土法机械化为主，大闹技术革命，以便在短期内使机械工业中最薄弱的环节——铸工实现机械化。
    过去许多人认为铸工车间要机械化，就得像沈阳第一机床厂那样，输送带天上、地下七、八层，要有投资，有设计，有设备，有工程师才成；另有些权威人士认为，年产量在五千吨以下的铸工车间不宜采用机械化。这些论调影响着铸工机械化搞不起来。在大跃进中，许多工厂的铸造工人在党的领导下，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，积极贯彻土洋结合，以土为主的方针，大造土机器，大搞铸工机械化，使手工操作的情况有了初步改变。如天津市河北区铸工用土法实现机械化后，生产效率提高五至八倍。一般来说，实现机械化后，劳动生产率和造型场的单位面积产量可以提高三至五倍。但是还有些人认为土的不如洋的，土的以后还是要以洋的来代替；有的人虽然承认土的不错，但是认为只适用于小厂。
    为了打破各种各样的保守思想，会议介绍了天津第九水暖器材厂等单位土法机械化的经验，并组织代表到第九水暖器材厂、大众铁工厂、纺织机械厂等工厂进行现场参观。第九水暖器材厂在大跃进开始后，广泛发动群众，开展人人献计、个个献策的运动，在二个月内制造了断铁机、冲天炉加料机、压膜造型机、垂直封闭式的铸工输送器等，基本上实现了机械化。
    通过介绍、参观和小组讨论，代表们解放了思想，破除了迷信，打破了中小型铸工厂不宜实行机械化的陈腐观点，大家认为，针对生产和当前的薄弱环节，充分发动群众，实行土洋结合，以土为主，大闹机械化，是我国铸工机械化的道路。（附图片）
