Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch: A reporter from this news agency reports: 1958 was a year in which the people of the Middle East achieved victories of particularly important significance. With the support of the people of the world, they repelled and thwarted the armed aggression of the two most ferocious and largest imperialist countries and also uprooted the base of the most important tool of imperialist aggression in the Middle East. The people of the Middle East justly branded the imperialists with a mark of shame that they will never be able to wash away.

This year, things have been particularly difficult for the imperialists, especially the U.S. imperialists. On New Year's Day, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, which closed in Cairo, passed a resolution severely condemning the various crimes of imperialism. At that time, the American press worriedly said that this was an "ominous omen" for the beginning of the year. Their premonition was correct. Throughout the year, the anti-colonialist movement to safeguard national independence among the people of the Middle East soared to unprecedented heights, and U.S. imperialism suffered crushing defeats, encountering one shameful failure after another. Among the series of events that occurred in the Middle East this year, it was fully exposed that U.S. imperialist aggressors are the most ferocious enemies of the Middle Eastern people, and it also exposed them as nothing more than paper tigers.

A major change in the post-war Middle East situation is the intensified intrusion of U.S. forces into the Middle East, replacing the position of Britain and France. After the failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, the United States openly put forward the slogan of "filling the vacuum." But it was even more cunning, trying its best to hide its true face, adopting even more sinister methods, and disguising itself as a "sympathizer of Arab nationalism." During the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, it even wore the mask of a "peacemaker." However, around May of this year, after the Lebanese people launched an armed uprising, the United States saw that the Chamoun regime it had supported was crumbling and endangering Lebanon, which it wanted to turn into a "Middle East beachhead" for promoting its aggressive policies. It then openly supported Chamoun with various forms of military aid. When the revolution broke out in Iraq, the United States tore off its last mask, sent troops to invade Lebanon, and attempted to strangle the Iraqi revolution in its cradle, in order to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys and suppress the increasingly high tide of national independence movements in the Middle East. This was the first time that U.S. imperialism most thoroughly exposed its true face as an aggressor in front of the people of the Middle East.

The United States failed shamefully this time. Despite exhausting all means to stay in Lebanon, it finally retreated quietly amidst the condemnation of the people of the world after staying for a hundred days. Not only did it not achieve its goals, but it achieved the opposite result. Chamoun finally collapsed, and the new government has announced its refusal to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The United States not only failed to strangle the revolution in Iraq, but also had to quickly slap itself in the face and announce its recognition. It wanted to scare the people of the Middle East, but instead, it further encouraged the people of various Middle Eastern countries to more resolutely carry out the struggle against imperialism; it wanted to extinguish the raging flames of safeguarding national independence, but instead, it made the eyes of the Middle Eastern people shine brighter, their fighting spirit even more high-spirited, and the banner of safeguarding national independence raised even higher.

In the Arab national independence movement, the revolution of the Iraqi people in overthrowing the corrupt Faisal-Said traitorous regime is of particularly important significance. It uprooted the most dangerous imperialist base within the Arab world and removed a pillar of the imperialist tools of aggression in the Middle East. After the war, the United States initially wanted to piece together a "Middle East Command" military group under its control, including all countries in the Middle East. Later, due to Egypt and Syria's pursuit of a policy of peace and neutrality, it had to abandon the "Southern Tier" and instead piece together only the "Northern Tier" military group. The result of the Iraqi revolution this year was that the U.S.'s "Northern Tier" group also suffered a fatal blow. The "sea wall" used by the United States to block the tide of Arab nationalism—Iraq under the rule of the Faisal dynasty—was finally breached.

In the process of repelling the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan and supporting the Iraqi revolution, the people of the Middle East, on the one hand, saw more clearly the faces of imperialism, especially the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, they also saw more clearly that imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger, and further strengthened their confidence in the struggle.

Other victories achieved by the people of the Middle East this year also confirmed the above views, including the announcement of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria in Cairo, which was quickly recognized by many Asian and African countries; the complete bankruptcy of the "Eisenhower Doctrine"; and the trial of the United States as an aggressor in the United Nations General Assembly Special Emergency Session.

The imperialists are not reconciled to these failures and continue to plot new conspiracies against the people of the Middle East in military, political, and economic aspects. Recently, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Twining, Defense Secretary McElroy, and Assistant Secretary of State Rountree have successively "visited" the Middle East. In particular, the activities of Rountree, as the American press does not shy away from saying, are for carrying out the vicious conspiracy of sowing discord among Arab countries and subverting the Republic of Iraq. The secret military conference of the Baghdad Pact held in Ankara in November also laid down a plan for the United States to expand military bases in the remaining member states of the Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact Council will soon hold a meeting in Karachi, and Dulles will personally come out to plan and arrange.

However, under the current general situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, in the face of the invincible anti-colonialist forces safeguarding national independence, any new conspiracies of imperialism will inevitably suffer shameful failures.

### 中东民族独立运动空前高涨  美英帝国主义碰得头破血流

    中东民族独立运动空前高涨
    美英帝国主义碰得头破血流
    ·新华社记者报道一年来中东人民的伟大胜利·
    新华社29日讯  本社记者报道：1958年，是中东人民取得有特别重要意义的胜利的一年。他们在世界人民支持下击退和挫败了最凶恶的也是最大的两个帝国主义国家的武装侵略，还拔除了帝国主义在中东最重要的侵略工具的基地。中东人民正当地给帝国主义者打上了使他们永远洗不掉的耻辱的烙印。
    这一年，帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的日子十分不好过。新年第一天，在开罗闭幕的亚非人民团结大会就通过决议严厉谴责帝国主义的各种罪行。当时美国报刊忧虑地说，这是一年之初“不祥的预兆”。他们的预感没有错。一年来中东人民反殖民主义、保卫民族独立运动空前高涨，美帝国主义碰得头破血流，遭到了一个又一个可耻的失败。在中东一年来发生的一系列事件中，完全暴露了美帝国主义侵略者是中东人民最凶恶的敌人，同时也暴露出它不过是一只纸老虎。
    战后中东局势的一个重大变化是美国势力加紧侵入中东，取代英法的地位。在英、法、以色列侵略埃及战争失败后，美国更公开提出“填补真空”的口号。但是它更加狡猾，竭力隐藏它的真面目，采取了更加阴险的手段，把自己打扮成“阿拉伯民族主义的同情者”，在英、法、以色列侵埃战争时它甚至还戴着“和事老”的假面具。但是到了今年5月间，黎巴嫩人民发动武装起义后，美国看到它所扶植的夏蒙政权摇摇欲坠，危及它想变为推行它的侵略政策的“中东滩头堡”的黎巴嫩，它就公开以各种军事援助支持夏蒙，及至伊拉克爆发了革命，美国就撕下最后一块面具，出兵侵略黎巴嫩，并且想进而扼杀伊拉克革命在襁褓之中，以便杀鸡警猴，把中东日益高涨的民族独立运动镇压下去。这是美帝国主义者第一次在中东人民面前最彻底地暴露了它的侵略者真面目。
    美国这次可耻地失败了。尽管它用尽各种办法想赖在黎巴嫩，结果在全世界人民谴责声中呆了一百天后，终于偃旗息鼓，悄然撤退。它的目的不但没有达到，反而取得了相反的结果。夏蒙终于垮台了，新政府已宣布拒绝接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。伊拉克的革命美国不但扼杀不掉，而且还不得不很快自打嘴巴，宣布予以承认。它想吓唬中东人民，结果却进一步鼓舞了中东各国人民更坚决地进行反对帝国主义的斗争；它想扑灭保卫民族独立的炽烈火焰，结果却是使中东人民眼睛擦得更亮，斗志更加高昂，保卫民族独立的旗帜举得更高。
    在阿拉伯民族独立运动中，伊拉克人民推翻了腐朽的费萨尔—赛义德卖国政权的革命，具有特别重要的意义，它连根拔除了阿拉伯内部的一个最危险的帝国主义基地，抽掉了帝国主义在中东的侵略工具的一根支柱。战后，美国最初想拼凑由它控制的包括全中东各国的“中东司令部”军事集团，后来由于埃及和叙利亚执行和平中立政策不得不放弃“南层”，退而改为只拼凑“北层”军事集团，今年伊拉克革命的结果，美国的“北层”集团也受到了致命的打击。美国曾经用来作为阻挡阿拉伯民族主义潮流的“海堤”——费萨尔王朝统治下的伊拉克，终于被冲垮。
    中东人民在打退美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略和支持伊拉克革命的斗争过程中，一方面他们更加清楚地看清了帝国主义的面目，特是美帝国主义的狰狞面目，同时，也更清楚地看清帝国主义只不过是纸老虎，进一步加强了他们斗争的信心。
    在这一年中，中东人民取得的其他胜利也证实了他们的上述看法，其中包括阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在开罗宣布成立，并迅速得到许多亚非国家的承认；“艾森豪威尔主义”的彻底破产；在联合国大会特别紧急会议上，美国作为侵略者以被告地位受审等。
    帝国主义不甘心于这些失败，还继续在军事、政治和经济各方面策划对中东人民的新阴谋。最近一个时期，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁、国防部长麦克耳罗伊、助理国务卿朗特里相继到中东“访问”，特别是朗特里的活动，美国报刊也不讳言，是为了进行在阿拉伯国家之间挑拨离间，以及颠复伊拉克共和国的恶毒阴谋。11月在安卡拉召开的巴格达条约秘密军事会议也订出了美国在巴格达条约残余成员国内扩建军事基地的计划。巴格达条约理事会不久又要在卡拉奇举行会议，杜勒斯又将亲自出马策划布置。
    可是在当前东风压倒西风的总形势下，在不可战胜的反殖民主义、保卫民族独立力量面前，帝国主义的任何新阴谋也必将遭到可耻的失败。
