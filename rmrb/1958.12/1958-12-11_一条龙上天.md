    A Dragon Ascends to Heaven
    Yisi
    People in Anhui Province have a saying, "A dragon ascends to heaven." This refers to the fact that the working class and peasants themselves have established elementary schools, middle schools, and universities. The dragon represents elementary, middle, and universities, and heaven represents communism. The meaning is that the working class and peasants must gradually popularize higher education to prepare for building socialism and transitioning to a communist society. This is a very meaningful metaphor. However, some people do not see it this way. Today, when this newspaper published the news of the Bengbu Machinery Factory establishing a worker's amateur industrial university, some people were against it.
    There wasn't much debate about the Bengbu Machinery Factory establishing elementary schools; establishing middle schools was also acceptable; but when it came to establishing a university, a fierce debate erupted. The workers were elated when they heard the news, especially after discussing the instructions on education work from the Central Committee and the State Council, and felt they had a bright future. Others, however, felt differently. First, they used the excuse that factories had never run universities before, saying that the factory conditions were too poor to run a university. Finally, they even used "the State Council has not approved it" as a shield. These two attitudes are in stark contrast.
    The different attitudes are determined by different ideologies. The Party organization of the Bengbu Machinery Factory promptly organized this debate, conducting detailed accounting, and refuting the opposition with concrete facts. The Bengbu Machinery Factory did the right thing, and the effect was good. The entire factory staff not only understood that the factory could run a university, but also conducted a communist education in conjunction with studying the instructions on education work. Now, our country's factories running schools has a completely new significance. It is for the thorough completion of the socialist revolution, for the need to adapt to socialist construction, and for the grand goal of realizing communism. Initially, factories running schools may not be done very well due to a lack of certain conditions, but over time, after accumulating some experience, they will gradually improve. Of course, it is not good to only talk about needs and not about conditions; but it is also wrong to unilaterally emphasize conditions and be a condition-only theorist, especially when the conditions they talk about are often just excuses?
    The instructions on education work from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council clearly state: "We should vigorously develop secondary and higher education, and strive to basically ensure that all young people and adults in the country who have the conditions and are willing can receive higher education within about fifteen years. We will use about fifteen years to popularize higher education, and then use about fifteen years to engage in improvement work." For workers to popularize secondary and higher education, it mainly relies on factories running schools. Under conditions that permit, it is possible to run schools all the way from elementary school to university, forming a dragon. There are many benefits to doing so. The main benefit is that education is combined with production, theory is combined with practice, and physical labor is combined with mental labor, which facilitates the faster and better training of knowledgeable intellectuals from the working class who are both red and expert. Some people only hope that workers will become literate and learn some production techniques, and then stop progressing. The workers gave these people a resounding answer: workers must not only advance and advance again, but also ascend to heaven. This is something that no one can stop.

    一条龙上天
    易斯
    安徽省的人有一句口头禅，叫做“一条龙上天”。这是指工农群众自己办起了小学、中学又办起了大学。龙是大、中、小学，天是共产主义。意思是说：工农群众要一步一步地普及高等教育，为了要建成社会主义过渡到共产主义社会作好准备。这是一个十分有意义的比喻。可是，有些人却不是这样看，今天本报发表的蚌埠机械厂创办工人业余工业大学时，有些人就是反对这样作的。
    蚌埠机械厂办了小学，争论不大；办了中学，也还可以；惟独要办大学的时候，展开了一场激烈的争论。工人听到了这个消息，欢欣鼓舞，特别是讨论了中央和国务院的关于教育工作的指示以后，觉得自己有奔头了。另外一些人却不同，先是拿出过去工厂没有办过大学作借口，说工厂条件太差，不能办大学。最后居然把“国务院没有批准”拿来作挡箭牌了。这两种态度，真是非常鲜明的对比。
    不同的态度是不同思想所决定的。蚌埠机械厂党组织及时地组织了这场辩论，进行算细账，用具体事实驳倒反对派。蚌埠机械厂做得很对，效果也好。全厂职工不仅理解了工厂能办大学，而且结合学习教育工作指示，进行了一次共产主义教育。现在我们国家的工厂办学有着完全崭新的意义，是为了彻底完成社会主义革命，是为了适应社会主义建设的需要，为了实现共产主义的远大目标。工厂办学校，最初可能因为缺少某些条件，办得不太好，但天长日久，积累了一些经验以后，就会逐步办好的。当然，只讲需要，不讲条件，这是不好的；但片面强调条件，唯条件论，这也是错误的，何况他们所说的条件，往往只是一些借口呢？
    中共中央和国务院关于教育工作的指示说得很清楚：“应当大力发展中等教育和高等教育，争取在十五年左右的时间内，基本上做到使全国青年和成年，凡是有条件的和自愿的，都可以受到高等教育。我们将以十五年左右的时间来普及高等教育，然后再以十五年左右的时间来从事提高的工作。”工人要普及中等教育和高等教育，主要是靠工厂办学。在条件许可的情况下，可以从小学一直办到大学，成为一条龙。这样做好处很多。最主要的好处是教育同生产结合，理论同实际结合，体力劳动和脑力劳动结合，便于更快更好地培养又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。有些人只希望工人扫了盲，学点生产技术就算了，不要再前进了。工人们给这些人一个响亮的回答：工人不仅要前进再前进，而且要上天。这是谁也不能阻挡的。
