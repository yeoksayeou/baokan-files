(Our correspondent from Changchun, December 10) Jilin City commercial departments, in the spirit of self-reliance, actively mobilized commercial workers and various organizations, doing everything possible to increase sources of goods, expand varieties, and supply market needs.

Currently, the Jilin City market offers many affordable and high-quality pastries and a variety of fresh meals. Restaurants operating around the clock are located on major streets, so people can enjoy delicious meals at any time. Various candies and canned goods fill large and small shops, available for people to choose from.

Since Jilin City launched a city-wide mass campaign to produce iron and steel, purchasing power has surged, and the supply of some market living materials has become relatively tight. The Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to ensure the needs of the masses, immediately appointed a secretary to take charge, vigorously mobilizing the masses to solve processing and transportation problems, break with old conventions, and actively find ways to meet market needs. Commercial workers throughout the city, under the slogan of "Let people eat their fill, eat well, and eat quickly," launched a red flag competition movement centered on improving market supply, and the market situation gradually improved.

The Jilin City commercial departments paid special attention to organizing local sources of goods, mobilizing various units to store and use for themselves, and produce and sell for themselves. They adopted a method of seizing every opportunity to carry out mass movements. Now, many government agencies and units have stored large quantities of vegetables, which can basically meet their needs. At the same time, the city also sells 100,000 jin of vegetables every day to supply units and households that have not stored vegetables. The commercial departments also mobilized the masses to make tofu and bean sprouts. For example, catering units with more than 500 people in the Longtan District have built tofu workshops. In addition, in order to solve part of the meat supply locally, the Jilin City commercial departments also actively mobilized government agencies and enterprises to raise pigs. The Jilin Smelter, with the help of the commercial departments, has purchased 270 piglets and properly solved the supply of feed.

In the red flag competition movement, catering workers throughout the city, in the case of less meat supply, made many good vegetarian dishes that were very popular among the masses. Workers in various food processing plants also studied the use of various coarse grains to process various pastries. The Jilin City Food Factory used rice flour, corn flour, sorghum flour, and sweet potato flour to make more than 100 kinds of pastries, reducing costs by more than 10%. The rice flour bread made by the Jilin City Food Production Cooperative is fragrant and sweet, and the masses love it very much. Now, the supply of pastries in Jilin City has doubled compared to the beginning of November.

All sectors of the Jilin City commercial departments also actively improved supply methods to facilitate the needs of the masses. After implementing the supply of pork with coupons, the masses can buy pork from various non-staple food stores morning and evening. In addition to opening twelve restaurants operating around the clock in the city, many restaurants also deliver meals to steelworkers day and night, boosting the morale of the steelworkers. At the same time, some hotels have also opened cafeterias for travelers, and hotels without cafeterias have also tried their best to link up with restaurants to reserve meals for travelers. Now, people traveling to Jilin City on business rarely worry about not being able to find a place to stay or eat.

    吉林市市场货源大增
    蔬菜已可基本满足需要
    糕点品种翻新受人喜爱
    供应方法改善群众称便
    本报长春10日电  吉林市商业部门本着自力更生的精神，积极发动商业职工和各机关团体，千方百计地增加货源，扩大花色品种，供应市场需要。
    目前，在吉林市的市场上，出现了许多价廉物美的糕点和各种新鲜的饭菜。通宵营业饭店分设各个主要街道，人们无论什么时候进餐，都能吃到可口的饭菜。各类糖果、罐头摆满大店小铺，供人任意挑选。
    吉林市自从全市掀起全民大办钢铁的热潮后，购买力猛增，市场部分生活资料供应比较紧张。中共吉林市委为保证群众需要，立即由一位书记挂帅，大力发动群众解决加工、运输问题，大破陈规旧习、积极设法满足市场需要。全市商业部门职工，在“让人们吃饱、吃好、吃快”的口号下，掀起了以做好市场供应为中心的红旗竞赛运动，市场情况逐渐好转。
    吉林市商业部门特别注意就地组织货源，发动各单位自储自用，自产自销。他们采用了见缝插针的方法，大搞群众运动。现在，许多机关、单位已储存大量蔬菜，基本可以满足需要。同时，全市每天还有十万斤蔬菜出售，供应那些没有储菜的单位和住户。商业部门还发动广大群众制做豆腐、豆芽。如龙潭区五百人以上的伙食单位，大都建起了豆腐作坊。此外，为就地解决部分肉食供应，吉林市商业部门还积极发动机关、企业养猪，吉林冶炼厂在商业部门的帮助下，已购进猪崽二百七十头，并妥善地解决了饲料的供应。
    在红旗竞赛运动中，全市饮食业职工在肉食供应较少的情况下，做出了不少以素代荤的好菜，深受广大群众欢迎。各食品加工厂职工，还研究用各种粗粮加工各类糕点。吉林市食品厂用大米面、苞米面、高粱面、甘薯面制做出一百多种糕点，成本降低10％以上。吉林市食品生产合作社制做的大米面面包，又香又甜，群众非常喜爱。现在，吉林市的糕点供应量，比11月初增加一倍。
    吉林市商业部门各行各业还积极改进供应方法，便利群众需要。猪肉实行凭证供应后，群众到各副食品商店朝夕都可买到猪肉。全市除开设了十二处通宵营业饭店外，许多饭馆还日夜给钢铁战士送饭，鼓舞了钢铁战士的斗志。同时，有些旅馆还开设了旅客食堂，没有食堂的旅店，也都尽力与饭馆挂钩，为旅客预约饭菜。现在到吉林市公出的人，很少有为住不上店、吃不上饭操心的。
