    舒茶公社妥善安排妇女生产和生活
    新华社合肥15日电  安徽省舒茶人民公社根据妇女生理上的特点，在分配生产任务时，适当照顾多分配轻活，少分配重活，多分配近活，少分配远活。公社成立有四个缝纫厂，一个养蚕厂，三十六个鞋厂，二十个洗衣厂等，共有七百三十八个妇女在这些厂里工作。公社的食堂工作人员80％以上是妇女。
    为了让母亲们能够安心生产，公社共建立八个幼儿园，一百九十九个托儿所和托儿组。
    由于公社对妇女的关怀，妇女的发病率大大降低了。办公社前三个月，妇女内科发病率占全体妇女总数的7％；办公社后三个月，已降低到3％。妥善地安排妇女劳力，适当地在生活上加以照顾，给妇女的鼓舞很大，她们的劳动积极性大大提高。现在妇女的出勤率达到百分之百。妇女的作用也充分发挥了。由于大批妇女参加食堂和其他服务性行业，全社已腾出一千三百多个男劳动力参加了工农业生产。
