    A Good Method
    The active promotion of fattening pigs in various parts of Sichuan seems to have considerable benefits: First, it is a guarantee of continuing to effectively increase the supply of meat to urban and rural people in the short term. Second, in the development of sideline production, it is an important way for people's communes and the vast number of farmers to increase cash income in a very short period. Therefore, it is right for various parts of Sichuan to focus on this work at this time.
    Currently, there are many favorable conditions for promoting pig fattening in various places: people's communes collectively raise pigs and promote pig fattening, and there have been great improvements in feeding management technology; this year, various places have had bumper harvests in agricultural production, which has provided a large amount of green fodder and concentrated feed for promoting pig fattening. At this time, all localities should devote their efforts, rely on the people's communes to actively raise pigs, and do everything possible to promote pig fattening.

    一个好办法
    四川各地积极催喂肥猪，看来好处不小：第一，它是在短期内继续有效地增加城乡人民肉食供应的保证；第二，在发展副业生产中，它是使人民公社和广大农民在一个很短期间增加现金收入的重要办法。所以，四川各地在这个时候对这个工作大抓一把，是作得很对的。
    现在，各地催喂肥猪都有许多好条件：人民公社集体喂养生猪和催喂肥猪，在饲养管理技术上已经有了很大改进；今年各地农业生产大丰收，使催喂肥猪有了大量的青饲料和精饲料；在这个时候，各地应当拿出力量，依靠人民公社积极养猪，千方百计催喂肥猪。
