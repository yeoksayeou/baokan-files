    Our Canteen is Using Artificial Coal
    The canteen of the Guihua Production Team of the Tankou Commune in Jiangbei County, Sichuan Province, has to supply meals for more than a thousand people and feed more than a thousand pigs. It used to burn more than 5,000 catties of coal every day, spending more than 30 yuan in cash. The most annoying thing was that it had to dispatch 50 laborers every day to carry coal from a coal mine more than 20 li away.
    Li Jiaxing, the cook of the Guihua First Canteen, was anxious about this day and night. He suddenly thought: "Isn't 'soil-smoked fertilizer' made by burning mud mixed with messy dry grass, turf, and grain stubble? It burns very well! And it's slow-burning. This method might be good." Li Jiaxing mixed 200 catties of fertile mud, 20 to 25 catties of rice husks, 1 catty of salt, and 10 catties of sawdust with water, made them into flat, round briquettes, and dried them to remove moisture. After that, he either dried them in the sun or baked them in the stove pit before burning them. They also used another formula: 100 catties of fertile mud, 20 catties of cow dung, 10 catties of dry grass (chopped into fine pieces), and 3 catties of fine coal powder (made the same way). These artificial coal briquettes ignited quickly in the coal stove, and the heat was almost the same as coal. Four artificial coal briquettes, each weighing one catty, burned for twenty-one minutes. Everyone applauded and praised them, and they were promoted across the board. Not only did they save dozens of yuan in cash every day, but they also greatly saved labor.

    我们食堂用上了人造煤
    四川江北县滩口公社桂花生产队的食堂要供给一千多人的伙食；又要供给一千多头猪的饲料。每天要烧五千多斤煤炭，花三十多元的现金还不算，最恼火的是每天要调五十个劳力去二十多里以外的煤厂去挑炭。
    桂花第一食堂的炊事员李加兴日夜都在为这件事心焦，他忽然想到：“烧‘土熏肥’不就是用泥巴混和杂乱的干草和草皮、谷桩一起烧的吗？燃得很好呀！又熬火，这办法大概不错。”李加兴用二百斤肥泥巴、二十斤到二十五斤谷壳、一斤盐、十斤锯木屑拌匀后加水，做成扁圆形的煤球，晾干水气、再用太阳晒干或放在灶坑内烘干后就可烧了。他们又用了另一种配料法：一百斤肥泥、二十斤牛粪、十斤干草（铡成细节）、三斤煤炭细沫（做法相同）。这些人造煤放在煤炭灶内很快就引燃了，火力同煤炭差不多，四个一斤重的人造煤球，燃了二十一分钟，大家拍手赞好，从此就全面推开了。不但每天节约了几十元现金开支，而且大大的节约了劳力。
