Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 14th: The Soviet Foreign Ministry delivered the Soviet government's statement regarding the upcoming Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council to the governments of all NATO member states on December 13th. The Soviet government's statement proposed three recommendations to the governments of the member states of this organization:

	The first recommendation – The signing of a non-aggression treaty between the member states of NATO and the Warsaw Pact Organization, a suggestion that the Warsaw Pact member states have already formally put forward. The Soviet government suggests agreeing to add a clause to the articles of the North Atlantic Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty, stipulating that the participating countries of the two treaties shall not provide military, economic, or spiritual support to aggressors.

	The second recommendation – To negotiate and reach an agreement on the establishment of a nuclear weapon and rocket-free zone in Central Europe on the basis of the recent proposal by the Polish government, as the Polish government's proposal has taken into consideration the views of Western countries in many respects.

	The third recommendation – To begin a consistent reduction of foreign troops stationed within the territories of NATO and Warsaw Pact countries, even if it is initially on a small scale.

The statement said that the Soviet government also believes that the Berlin issue must be resolved soon, as the foreign occupation of Berlin is a serious source of international tension. It is suggested that the status of West Berlin as a demilitarized free city be determined as the basis for resolving the Berlin issue.

The statement also said that the Soviet government remains as convinced as ever that the best way to resolve international disputes under the current conditions is to convene a summit meeting of heads of government. The Soviet government will continue to strive to convene this meeting. However, before this meeting is convened, unremitting efforts should be made to resolve every issue that causes distrust and friction in relations between countries, and to eliminate the deep contradictions that now divide countries into East and West, even if it is only to eliminate partial contradictions.

The Soviet government statement emphasized that all the practical activities of NATO show that it is an exclusive military organization, deeply hostile to the interests of maintaining peace, and uniting its member states on the basis of an arms race, desperately promoting the "Cold War," and undermining the policy of peaceful cooperation between countries. Facts prove that NATO is an instrument for preparing for war, and its entire system of institutions is moving in the direction of expanding war preparations. The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union welcomes any steps and proposals by NATO that can ease international tensions.

The Soviet government pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Group does not hide the fact that the Paris meeting will discuss the issue of accelerating the establishment of American rocket bases and nuclear bases in the territories of those NATO member states that do not yet have these bases.

The statement said that it is clear that the Paris meeting is intended to undermine the resistance of these Western European countries to the plan to establish American rocket-nuclear weapon bases in their territories.

In the statement, the Soviet government believes it must once again remind people that the implementation of the plan to establish American nuclear weapon bases and rocket bases in the territories of NATO's Western European member states will have serious consequences.

The statement said that once someone attempts to commit aggression against the Soviet Union and its socialist allies, it will be inevitable to retaliate against the rocket-nuclear weapon bases of NATO due to military necessity. The statement said that European countries that allow the establishment of these bases on their territories will place themselves in an extremely serious position. The same is true of Canada, which has agreed to establish a wide network of American rocket installations and nuclear warhead warehouses.

The statement emphasized that agreeing to set up American atomic bases and rocket bases is a step with serious consequences, which will greatly bring the danger of launching a rocket-nuclear war closer. The Soviet government believes that technological development has forever ended the situation where war could not affect certain countries. The statement pointed out that the particular danger lies first in handing over nuclear weapons to West Germany.

Regarding the plan to establish the so-called "NATO Baltic Sea Command" (which means making Denmark succumb to West Germany's military plans), the statement said that the Soviet Union fully supports the proposals of the German Democratic Republic and Poland to transform the Baltic Sea into a zone of peace. However, the Soviet Union and other countries along the Baltic Sea cannot but pay attention to the above-mentioned war preparations of NATO.

The statement exposes the lies of Western politicians regarding NATO gradually ceasing to be a purely military group and increasingly becoming an institution of "politically equal cooperation." The statement emphasized that this kind of rhetoric is an attempt to deceive the general public who are worried about this group's war preparations.

The Soviet government statement emphasized that NATO is increasingly strengthening its role as an international gendarme in suppressing national liberation movements in colonial countries and dependencies. Less than half a year ago, the world saw the fact that within the scope of this military group, the system of building military bases on the territories of certain countries was used by the two main participants of NATO—the United States and Britain—to carry out military intervention in two small Arab countries.

    苏联政府就巴黎会议发表声明
    北大西洋组织应停止扩大备战活动
    并向各成员国提出三项缓和欧洲局势的建议
    新华社15日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联外交部13日把苏联政府关于北大西洋公约组织理事会即将举行的巴黎会议的声明交给了北大西洋公约组织所有成员国的政府。苏联政府的声明向这个公约组织成员国的政府提出了三项建议：
    第一项建议——北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织参加国之间签订互不侵犯条约，这一点华沙条约成员国已经正式提出过建议。苏联政府建议商定在北大西洋公约和华沙条约的条文中增加一项，规定这两个条约的参加国不得给予侵略者以军事上和经济上或者精神上的支援。
    第二项建议——议定最近在波兰政府的建议的基础上就建立中欧无核武器和火箭武器区达成协议，因为波兰政府的建议在多方面考虑到了西方国家的看法。
    第三项建议——着手一致减少驻扎在北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约国家境内的外国军队，最初那怕是小规模地减少。
    声明说，苏联政府还认为在最近必须解决柏林问题，外国占领柏林是国际紧张局势的严重根源。建议确定西柏林非军事化自由城市的地位，作为解决柏林问题的基础。
    声明中还说，苏联政府仍然和过去一样深信，在当前条件下解决国际争端的上策是召开政府首脑会议。苏联政府将继续努力争取召开这个会议。但是，在现在还没有召开这个会议之前，应当不懈地努力来解决每一个会在国与国之间的关系中引起不信任和摩擦的问题，应当消除那些现在把国家分为东西两部的深刻矛盾，那怕是消除局部矛盾也好。
    苏联政府声明中强调指出，北大西洋公约组织全部实际活动表明，它是一个排他性的军事组织，它对维护和平的利益深怀敌意，在军备竞赛、拼命鼓吹“冷战”、破坏各国和平合作的政策的基础上把自己的成员国结合起来。事实证明，北大西洋公约组织是准备战争的工具，它的机构的整个系统都是在朝着扩大战争准备的方向活动。声明指出，苏联欢迎北大西洋公约组织任何可以缓和国际紧张局势的步骤和建议。
    苏联政府指出，北大西洋公约集团并不隐瞒，巴黎会议将讨论在那些暂时还没有美国火箭基地和核基地的北大西洋公约组织成员国境内加速设置这些基地的问题。
    声明说，显然，巴黎会议是为了要破坏这些西欧国家对于在它们境内设置美国火箭—核武器基地计划的抵制。
    苏联政府在声明中认为必须再次提醒注意，实现在北大西洋公约组织西欧成员国境内建立美国核武器基地和火箭基地的计划会带来严重的后果。
    声明说，一旦有人试图对苏联和苏联的社会主义盟国进行侵略，由于军事上的必要，就不可避免地要对北大西洋公约组织的火箭—核武器基地进行回击。声明说，允许在本国境内建立这些基地的欧洲国家将使自己处于极其严重的地位。加拿大的情况也是如此，它同意建立广泛的美国火箭装置和核弹头仓库网。
    声明中强调指出，同意设置美国原子基地和火箭基地是个后果严重的步骤，它会使发动火箭—核战争的危险大为逼近。苏联政府认为，技术的发展永远结束了战火波及不到某些国家的情况。声明指出，特别的危险首先在于把核武器交给西德。
    在谈到建立所谓“北大西洋公约组织波罗的海司令部”的计划（这意味着使丹麦屈服于西德的军事计划）时，声明说，苏联完全支持德意志民主共和国和波兰关于变波罗的海为和平区的主张。但是，苏联和波罗的海沿岸的其他国家，不能不注意北大西洋公约组织的上述战争准备。
    声明揭穿西方国家政界人士的关于北大西洋公约组织逐渐不再是纯粹的军事集团和日益变成“政治上平等合作”的机构的谰言。声明强调指出，这种谰调是企图迷惑对这个集团备战活动感到忧虑的广大公众。
    苏联政府声明中强调指出，北大西洋公约组织越来越加强它在殖民地国家和附属国内镇压民族解放运动所起的国际宪兵作用。不到半年前，世界各国都看到了这样的事实：在这个军事集团的范围内，在某些国家的领土上建筑军事基地系统是如何地被北大西洋公约组织的两个主要参加国——美国和英国用来对两个不大的阿拉伯国家进行军事干涉的。
