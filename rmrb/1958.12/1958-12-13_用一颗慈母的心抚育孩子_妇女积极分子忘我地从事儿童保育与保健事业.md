Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: With such a group of women loyal to the socialist cause of childcare and healthcare, China's growing new generation will receive excellent nurturing. The speeches of several representatives at today's National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference showed that entrusting children to such individuals is forever worthy of people's trust.

"Dedicate my life to early childhood education," "Devote a lifetime to children," and "Be both red and expert in childcare" are the resolutions expressed by several childcare workers in their speeches today. Park Jin-sik, a kindergarten teacher from Chao Ying People's Commune in Wangqing County, Jilin Province, who has worked as a caregiver for eight years, spoke about her experience in childcare. She believes that kindergartens should not only provide childcare for commune members, enabling mothers to work in the fields with peace of mind, but also educate children according to their age and psychological characteristics, cultivate their collectivism and creativity, and foster a habit of loving labor. In the past eight years, 340 children she has educated have been approved as Young Pioneers. Zhang Zhijun, director of the Dalian Railway Area Nursery, which was named an advanced childcare unit in Dalian in 1957, told everyone that all the staff in her nursery have established the idea of "everything for children, in every way for children, and all for children." Therefore, with an average of 6.8 children under the care of each staff member, they not only excellently completed their own work tasks but also organized sewing groups, hairdressing groups, and toy-making groups. Their goal is to create a "seven satisfaction" nursery, making parents satisfied with the service attitude, the care, the education, the meals, the hygiene, the convenience of picking up the children, and the convenience of dropping off the children. Xia Huijuan, the director of the Fumei Commune Nursery in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, introduced the arduous process of her leading the establishment of the nursery. They transformed a dilapidated old house into a beautiful nursery, took out bed boards from their own homes for the children to sleep on, and went to the mountains to chop firewood to cook porridge for the children, doing everything themselves. The nursery is getting better and better, making many mothers who were initially reluctant to send their children to the nursery trust them and happily send their children in. Xia Huijuan said that they realize that taking care of children is more important than managing tractors or water pumps. They are determined to run the nursery even better and cultivate a group of outstanding successors to communism. Qi Sujun, the representative of the staff and family committee of the Garmu Auto Repair Factory under the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration, introduced their nursery station, setting an example for running childcare facilities on the plateau. The Party committee held an on-site meeting there, and people from nearby areas were sent to visit and learn from them, and they were awarded a red flag by the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee for this reason.

This year, the Qianjin People's Commune in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, established a new organizational form for maternal and child healthcare work based on the maternity hospital - the Mother and Child Happiness Paradise. Wang Luan, the director of the women's federation of this commune, introduced the specific situation of this new type of organization in detail at today's meeting. The Qianjin People's Commune originally had 23 maternity hospitals. After the establishment of the people's commune in August of this year, the masses felt that the maternity hospital could no longer adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, and the Party committee also considered that the objective conditions were available to improve the organizational form of the maternity hospital. Therefore, it was decided to change the maternity hospital into one hospital and three rooms, adding a waiting room for pregnant women, a postpartum mother and child recuperation room, and an infant feeding room in addition to the maternity hospital. This allows pregnant women to receive care before childbirth, and sufficient rest after childbirth. Infants under six months old can also be cared for, allowing mothers to produce with peace of mind. Now, one hospital and three rooms have developed into a more complete healthcare institution called the "Mother and Child Happiness Paradise," which has a medical department, an obstetrics department, an infant and childcare department, an early childhood education department, and a maternal and child health department, as well as an administration office responsible for the overall administrative leadership of the park. It now houses 43 pregnant women and 550 infants and young children. Infants from birth until they are six years old and can go to school are all supported and educated by the Happiness Paradise. The establishment of this organization is deeply loved by the masses.

Two pediatricians introduced their contributions to medical work in protecting children's health in their speeches today. Li Jiayi, an attending physician at the Institute of Pediatrics of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said that 35 of their 41 researchers are women. In the past five months, under the leadership of the Party and in close cooperation with the Beijing Children's Hospital, they have launched a struggle against the most serious diseases threatening children's lives, resulting in a cure rate of 99.05% for toxic indigestion and 93.2% for toxic dysentery. When rescuing children with toxic dysentery, they guarded the bedside day and night until the patient could sit up in bed and eat. One child stopped breathing intermittently for 24 hours and then completely stopped for 3 hours, and another child stopped breathing completely for 45 minutes, but they were all successfully rescued. Jiang Yongyao, a physician at the Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, reported on her treatment of three sick children in her speech. Two of them suffered from toxic indigestion complicated by third-degree malnutrition. One was only twelve days old, and the other was less than one year old. It was difficult to give such small children fluids and plasma, and to give them injections. She often persisted for several hours to carry out this very delicate and complex work, finally allowing the children to regain their lives.

Today, 16 women activists from the agricultural front continued to speak at the meeting. Among them were experts in planting cash crops - the famous female cotton expert, Zhang Qiuxiang, deputy director of the Hongqi People's Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province; Li Yuhua, the representative of five women from the Huangkou People's Commune in Xiaoxian County, Anhui Province, who cultivated high-yield cotton fields through painstaking efforts; Aimulahan, the deputy captain of the production team of the Xianfeng People's Commune in Toksun County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, who, together with six women, planted a mu of peanut experimental field with a yield of 2,160 jin per mu; Liu Lanjun, the representative of the "Huangyan Satellite Girls Technical Team" from the Hongqi People's Commune in Yidu County, Shandong Province, who cultivated tobacco leaves as tall as small trees and sorghum; and Qiu Zhizhen, from the famous honey tangerine producing area of ​​Nanfeng County, Jiangxi Province, who once led a honey tangerine experimental team to create an unprecedented bumper harvest record in the local area. Among them were also ingenious craftsmen who boldly innovated technology - Yao Shuzhen, the director of the women's affairs of the Gonghe Operation Area in Yushu County, Jilin Province, who led the women of the township to build a small hydropower station; Li Xiuying, a member of the Management Committee of the Yanchi People's Commune in Jingmen County, Hubei Province, who once created a seed drill that increased wheat sowing efficiency by nine times, and is now uniting more than 80 people to carry out tool reform; He Zhongxiao, the leader of the Michurin Experimental Group of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Yongchuan County, Sichuan Province, who studied the principles of Michurin's theory and cultivated 27 new varieties of oranges, pears, apples, nectarines, cypresses, and mulberries in more than a year; 钭杏仙, the captain of the Women's Production Team of the Majiakeng Women's Production Team of the Red Star People's Commune in Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, who led a women's production team to continuously study diligently and skillfully to obtain the best harvest in the local area; Wang Guifang, from the Huangqiao People's Commune in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, who was praised by the local masses as a model of technological innovation because of manufacturing soil pesticides for pest control and water-powered mills and actively promoting rope-traction plows; and Wang Denglian, a twelve-year-old girl who is the deputy "group" leader of the "Hundred Flowers Group" composed of one hundred girls from Gantian Township in Jinsha County, Guizhou Province.

    用一颗慈母的心抚育孩子
    妇女积极分子忘我地从事儿童保育与保健事业
    新华社12日讯  有着这样一批忠实于社会主义的儿童保育与保健事业的妇女，我国正在成长中的新生一代将受到良好的抚育。全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议今天几位代表的发言向人们表明，把孩子交在这样一批人的手里，是永远值得人们信任的。
    “把我的一生献给幼儿教育事业”、“为孩子献出一生”、“在保育事业上做到又红又专”，这是今天好几位保育工作者在她们的发言中所表示的决心。做了八年幼儿园教养员工作的吉林省汪清县超英人民公社的朴今植谈起她的保育工作经验时，认为幼儿园不光是为社员托管孩子，使母亲能够安心下地干活，还必须根据孩子们的年龄和心理特点进行教育，培养他们的集体主义和创造精神，养成爱劳动的习惯。八年来，经过她教育的孩子，有三百四十人被批准为少先队员。1957年被评为旅大市先进保育单位的大连铁路地区托儿所主任张志筠告诉大家，她们全所人员已经树立了“处处为儿童，事事为儿童，一切为儿童”的思想。因此，在一个工作人员平均照管六点八个孩子的情况下，她们不仅出色地完成了自身的工作任务，而且还组织了裁缝组、理发组、制造玩具小组，她们奋斗的目标是做一个“七满意”的托儿所，使家长对服务态度满意，对护理满意，对教育满意，对伙食满意，对卫生满意，对接孩子满意，对送孩子满意。广东省新会县富美社托儿所所长夏惠娟介绍了她带头办起托儿所的艰苦过程。她们把一间无人居住又破又烂的旧屋改建成一个漂亮的托儿所，把自己家里的床板拿出来给孩子睡，到山上砍柴给孩子熬粥吃，一切都是亲自动手。托儿所办得越来越好，使许多原来不放心送孩子入托的母亲们都信赖她们，高高兴兴地把孩子送进来。夏惠娟说，她们认识到管孩子比管拖拉机、抽水机更重要。决心把托儿所办得更好，培养出一批优秀的共产主义的接班人。青藏公路管理局噶尔木汽车修配厂职工家属委员会代表祁素君介绍的她们那里的托儿站，为高原上也能办起托儿事业树立了榜样，党委曾在她们那里召开了现场会议，附近地区都派人来参观学习，她们并且因此而荣获青海省人民委员会奖给的一面红旗。
    河南省登封县前进人民公社在妇产院的基础上今年新建立了一种新的妇婴保健工作的组织形式——母子康福乐园。这个公社的妇联主任王鸾今天在会上详细介绍了这种新型组织的具体情况。前进人民公社原来有二十三所妇产院，今年8月成立了人民公社以后，群众感到妇产院已不能适应生产大跃进的形势，党委也考虑到客观上已具备了将妇产院的组织形式加以提高的有利条件，于是便决定将妇产院改为一院三室，除产院外，增设孕妇待产室、产后母子休养室、婴儿哺乳室，这样可以使孕妇在产前就得到照顾，产后又得到充足的休息，半岁以下的婴儿也能有人照管，使母亲们可以安心生产。现在，一院三室又发展成为“母子康福乐园”这种比较完备的保健机构，里面设有医疗部、妇产部、婴托部、幼儿教育部、妇幼卫生部，另有园务处负责全园行政领导工作。现在已收容孕妇四十三人，婴儿和幼儿五百五十人。婴儿从出生直到六岁能入学时止，全部由康福乐园负责供养和教育。这种组织建立以后，深受广大群众的热爱。
    两位儿童医师在今天的发言中介绍了她们为保护儿童的健康，在医疗工作中作出贡献的事迹。中国医学科学院儿科研究所主治大夫李家宜说，他们全所四十一个研究人员中，有三十五个是女同志，五个月来，她们在党的领导和北京市儿童医院密切协作下，向威胁儿童生命最严重的疾病展开了斗争，结果使中毒性消化不良症的治愈率达到99.05％，中毒性痢疾的治愈率达到93.2％。她们在抢救患有中毒性痢疾的孩子时，都是日夜不断地守护在病床边，直到病人能坐在床上吃东西为止。有一个孩子呼吸断续停了二十四小时，又全停了三小时，另一个孩子呼吸全停了四十五分钟，但都被她们胜利地救活了。江西省儿童医院的医师蒋永尧在发言里报告她治疗三个患病儿童的经过。其中两个都是患中毒性消化不良合并第三度营养不良症，一个生下来只有十二天，一个不满一周岁，给这样小的孩子补液、补血浆，打起针来是困难的事。她经常坚持好几个钟头，来进行这项非常精细而复杂的工作，终于使孩子们重新获得了生命。
    今天，有十六位农业战线上的妇女积极分子继续在会上发言。她们之中有种植经济作物的能手——著名的植棉女专家、陕西省渭南县红旗人民公社副主任张秋香，经过千辛万苦培育出棉花丰产田的安徽省萧县黄口人民公社五名妇女的代表李玉华，同六名妇女合种一亩花生试验田亩产量达二千一百六十斤的新疆维吾尔自治区托克逊县先锋人民公社的生产队副队长艾木拉汗，把烟叶培育得像小树和高粱一般高的山东省益都县红旗人民公社“黄烟卫星姑娘技术队”的代表刘兰菊，来自著名的蜜桔产地江西省南丰县曾领导一支蜜桔试验队创造当地史无前例的丰收纪录的丘芝珍。她们之中还有大胆革新技术的能工巧匠——领导全乡妇女建成一座小型水力发电站的吉林省榆树县共和作业区妇女主任姚淑珍，曾经创造出一种条播机使小麦播种效率提高九倍、现在又团结了八十多人一起大搞工具改革的湖北省荆门县盐池人民公社管委会委员李秀英，学习米丘林学说原理在一年多时间内培育出广柑、梨子、苹果、水蜜桃、柏树、桑树等二十七种新品种的四川省永川县东风人民公社米丘林试验小组组长何忠孝，领导一支妇女生产队不断勤学巧干获得当地最好收成的浙江省缙云县红星人民公社马加坑妇女生产队长钭杏仙，由于制造出治虫土农药和水冲磨并且积极推行绳索牵引犁而被当地群众夸为技术革新榜样的江苏省泰兴县黄桥人民公社的王桂芳，还有一位十二岁的小姑娘王登莲，她是贵州省金沙县甘田乡由一百个小姑娘组成的“百花群”的副“群”长，一年来，她们学会了使用单铧犁、三角丛植栽秧法等技术，而且都胜过了老农民，被人夸做打尖兵的姑娘、万能的姑娘。今天发言的，还有扬名中外的修建十三陵水库工程中的先进集体——“九兰组”中的“三兰”郝玉兰，辽宁省建平县红旗人民公社青松岭青年妇女山区建设队“五英”（五位名字上有“英”字的妇女）中的“大英”、队长迟月英，河北省饶阳县西河乡领导改洼地种稻田的人民公社副社长宋欣茹，河南省荥阳县高山人民公社竹川养猪场场长韩玉花，内蒙古自治区敖汉旗五女绵羊改良站的代表谢桂兰。
    今天在大会上发言的其余代表是：上海市中医学院研究班学员张仲芳，山西省太谷县火箭人民公社供销部副部长杨精华，广东省江门港务局“旅客之家”代表伦锦意，重庆建设机床厂食堂炊事员曹银贞。
    在今天下午的大会上，著名女英雄刘胡兰的母亲胡文秀应邀向大家报告了刘胡兰的英雄事迹。
    今天发言的代表共二十七人。13日，大会将继续举行。
    陕西省宝鸡市马营人民公社明星生产队幼儿院的工作同志们，热心、细心、耐心的让孩子们吃好、玩好、休息好，受到社员们的称赞。这是孩子们正在吃早饭，看他们吃得多有味。
