    Discuss Matters with the Masses More
    Since its establishment, the Chengguan Town People's Commune in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, has made it a practice to decide on production plans, distribution schemes, and arrangements for autumn harvest, autumn planting, deep plowing, and the great steel-making campaign through democratic discussions at the meetings of commune members' representatives and all commune members. This gives commune members a sense of ownership and fully stimulates their enthusiasm, enabling them to complete various production tasks quickly and well.
    In late September this year, the commune decided to sow 3,500 mu of wheat, requiring 100,000 jin of wheat seeds. However, the commune only had 30,000 jin. At that time, many people felt it was impossible to accomplish. Some cadres suggested asking the leadership to allocate seeds from other places, while others advocated planting less wheat. The Party Committee proposed relying on the masses to solve the problem. As a result, after a discussion among the commune members, the commune collectively reported having over 80,000 jin of wheat seeds. Guo Jixian, Guo Haixian, and three other households contributed all 1,300 jin of wheat allocated to them by the commune as investment. The wheat planting task was not only not delayed but was completed seven days ahead of schedule.
    In financial matters, democratic management has been further promoted. When the commune was first established, some cadres advocated spending 8,000 yuan to build a people's hospital, including 1,700 yuan just for purchasing beds and installing electric lights. Commune members raised opinions, saying that this was a showy, extravagant, and wasteful phenomenon. The Party Committee supported the opinions of the commune members and managed to get the job done with just over 1,000 yuan. The commune members said with satisfaction: "If we are this democratic, the commune will definitely be run well."

    遇事多跟群众商量
    山西壶关县城关镇人民公社，自成立以来，不论是制定生产计划、分配方案和布置秋收、秋种、深翻地、大闹钢铁，都是通过社员代表大会和全体社员民主讨论决定。这样就使社员具有主人翁的感觉，充分发挥他们的积极性，把各项生产任务完成得又快又好。
    今年9月下旬，全社决定播种三千五百亩小麦，需要十万斤麦种，可是社里只有三万斤。当时不少人感到无法办，有的干部提出要领导上从别的地方调拨，有的主张少种些小麦。党委会提出了依靠群众来解决，结果在社员当中一讨论，全社就自报出麦种八万余斤。郭计先、郭海仙等五户社员，把自己社里分的一千三百斤小麦全部拿出来投资到社里。种麦任务不但没有推迟，而且提前七天完成了。
    在财务上，更发扬了民主管理。公社刚成立起时，有一部分干部主张用八千元建立一个人民医院，其中光购买病床和安电灯就需要一千七百元。社员纷纷提出意见，说这是一种讲排场、耍阔气的铺张浪费现象。党委支持了社员的意见，用一千余元就办了事。社员满意的说：“要是这样民主，公社一定能办好。”
