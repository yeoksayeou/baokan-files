According to Southern Daily news: The Yangmei Company of Hekou People's Commune in Sanshui County, Guangdong, has implemented democratic management alongside "Three-izations," resulting in a new situation of mutual trust and concern between cadres and commune members, and a dedication to production. Production targets are constantly being exceeded, and labor efficiency has generally increased by 30%-40% compared to before.

Yangmei Company implemented organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization in the first half of this year. In the early stages of militarization, some individual cadres had a one-sided understanding of the meaning of militarization. When some commune members raised opinions about the work, they would say to the commune members: "Do what you are told. Otherwise, what's the point of militarization?" When the company's Party organization discovered this situation, it immediately organized criticism and debate among the cadres, making them realize that militarization must be combined with democratic management. In this summary of the bumper harvest of the late rice crop, they mobilized cadres and the masses to conduct ideological summaries and major comparisons. Four comparisons were conducted among cadres: leadership methods, democratic style, ideological harvest, and enthusiasm. Among the masses, comparisons were made of awareness, enthusiasm, work attitude, work quality and efficiency, and love for the commune. Through summary and comparison, advanced figures were vigorously commended and rewarded, and advanced banners were erected. On this basis, democratic management system and the twelve standards for model commune members were formulated, giving cadres and masses a clear direction for their efforts.

In implementing democratic management, Yangmei Company implemented heart-to-heart talks every five days, mainly for commune members to talk about their opinions and demands on production and life, and to raise whatever they wanted to raise. The cadres heard from the heart-to-heart talks that the commune members had opinions about the public canteen, so they immediately convened an on-site canteen evaluation meeting. It was found that the canteen was not run well, mainly because leadership was not strengthened, management personnel's service attitude was not good, and sideline businesses were not developed enough. Therefore, the Party organization designated a company commander to be in charge of the canteen, and each canteen had a deputy platoon leader as the group leader. At the same time, sideline businesses were vigorously developed, planting thirty mu of vegetables, raising sixty pigs, and raising four hundred chickens. Tea was kept hot, rice was cooked well, the variety of dishes was diverse, and small shops were set up to facilitate the commune members. At the same time, the seating was comfortable and hygienic, which the commune members were very satisfied with.

Yangmei Company also mobilized commune members to write big-character posters and draw cartoons in the fields and canteens, allowing them to fully express their opinions. This had a great impact on the education of cadres. The cadres whose work style was not good before have undergone great changes. For example, a big-character poster in the old West Row canteen was dedicated to company commander Liang Bonan, writing: "Brother Bonan, everything has changed. In the past, you were busy in the company headquarters every day, but now you are busy in the fields at all times; in the past, you only knew how to brag about work, but now you really use your mouth and hands; in the past, you didn't ask about the lives of commune members, but now you care about commune members as if they were yourself; in the past, you only knew how to supervise others, but now you take the lead in everything." Some people also sang: "Red, green, thousands of red hearts connected together, building paradise together!"

Major work tasks and production plans in the company are widely mobilized for commune members to discuss and give opinions. Recently, the company headquarters handed the production plan for the early rice crop next year to the masses for discussion, which not only made the plan the demand of the commune members, but also the commune members put forward many useful suggestions, making the plan more proactive and reliable. For example, the cadres did not plan to combine burning soil with deep plowing, but the commune members proposed that burning soil could increase nitrogen fertilizer. Another example, when the cadres planned to solve the problem of self-flowing irrigation of the cracked pits in Tumingtang, it would require five mu of land to level the pond, and the commune members proposed opening a ring-shaped mountain ditch to draw water from the reservoir to irrigate the fields, which would not only avoid digging the pond, but also save labor.

After Yangmei Company implemented democratic management, the cadres' work style changed, and the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. Because the cadres can often rely on the commune members and trust the commune members, the commune members also obey the leadership, and their enthusiasm and initiative for production have been greatly improved. Li Yong'e said to the platoon leader: "No matter what the job is, no matter how difficult it is, as long as it is assigned to me, I will guarantee its completion."

According to our newspaper: The Party Committee of Shangji People's Commune in Xuchang County, Henan, recently launched a major debate throughout the commune on the work methods of the mass line, using advanced models to educate cadres to do a good job in democratic management. In the major debate, everyone agreed that Song Tingxian, the Party Branch Secretary of Songzhuang Brigade in this commune, implemented the work methods of the mass line relatively well. For example, when deep plowing of land first started, many commune members believed that they were so busy with steelmaking and ironmaking that they could plow small satellite fields, but if all the wheat fields were plowed, the wheat would have to be planted until the New Year! Therefore, they advocated using livestock to plow seven or eight inches deep. Song Tingxian patiently guided the masses to discuss, using many facts about increased production through plowing to illustrate the benefits of deep plowing, making everyone realize the importance of deep plowing for ensuring a bumper harvest of wheat next year. They all voluntarily moved to the fields, ate and lived on the land, and within twenty days, they had deeply plowed all the wheat fields. When collecting sweet potatoes, Song Tingxian was also a little worried at first, thinking that there were so many sweet potatoes, the cellar was not cleaned up, and the labor force was insufficient, how to collect them? But after earnestly mobilizing the commune members to conduct research, especially convening a symposium of old farmers, they came up with a solution. After starting to dig sweet potatoes, some commune members saw that transporting all the sweet potatoes from the ground to the village for storage would waste a lot of labor, so they suggested that sweet potatoes on high ground could be dug and stored locally. Song Tingxian immediately adopted this suggestion, thus saving a lot of manpower and animal power, and completed the collection task ahead of schedule. Under the leadership of Song Tingxian, the entire team actively produced with one heart, and the yields of various crops such as grain, flue-cured tobacco, and sesame were all increased, with the lowest increasing by two times compared to last year, and the highest increasing to eight times. It has become the highest-yielding team in the commune for various crops.

Completely opposite to Song Tingxian's work style is Tian Hongbin, the West Street production team leader of this commune. In his work, he is subjective and arbitrary, does not consult with the masses, his work methods are simple and crude, and he is divorced from the masses. For example, when harvesting tobacco leaves this year, the masses suggested that a certain labor force should be drawn to bake tobacco, but he did not listen, which delayed the tobacco baking season and damaged some of the tobacco leaves. Later, after being criticized by his superiors, he let all the labor force into tobacco baking. But because the preparations were not good beforehand, there were not enough stoves, and the tobacco leaves that were collected were damaged again because they could not be baked in time. Because his work style is not democratic, the commune members of this team are not enthusiastic about production. When planting wheat, they planted it slowly and the quality was poor, and they were rated as a backward team in the commune.

After this clear contrast was presented, cadres and commune members launched a heated debate on issues such as whether or not they could do a good job if they were divorced from the masses. Everyone agreed that the purpose of organizational militarization is to improve labor efficiency and promote production, and cadres must learn to better follow the mass line, fully promote democracy, and make everyone truly feel comfortable, so as to show the superiority of organizational militarization.

Through such comparative discussions, the vast number of cadres greatly improved their understanding of following the mass line, and put forward the slogan of "Learning from Song Tingxian," greatly strengthening their determination to run the people's commune well. Tian Hongbin and some cadres who originally had an undemocratic work style all made self-criticisms to the masses for their past mistakes, and expressed that they would resolutely follow the mass line and thoroughly change their work style in the future. The vast number of commune members expressed their satisfaction with the change in the cadres' work style, and their enthusiasm for production was even higher. (Kan Feng)

    河口公社杨梅连五天一谈，充分听取群众意见
    社员干部心心相印
    尚集公社抓先进插红旗教育干部走群众路线
    据南方日报消息  广东三水县河口人民公社杨梅连在“三化”的同时实行管理民主化，出现了干部社员互相信赖、互相关心、一心生产的新局面。生产指标不断被突破，劳动效率一般比原来提高30％—40％。
    杨梅连在今年上半年实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化。在军事化初期，曾有个别干部片面地去理解军事化的意义。当一些社员对工作提出意见时，他们就对社员说：“叫干什么就干什么。不然，还叫什么军事化。”连里党组织发现这种情况，便立即在干部中组织鸣放辩论，使干部认识到军事化必须和民主管理相结合。在这次总结晚造特大丰收中，他们又发动干部和群众进行思想总结，进行大评比。在干部中进行四比：比领导方法、比民主作风、比思想丰收、比干劲。在群众中，则比觉悟高、比干劲、比劳动态度、比工作质量与效率、比爱社。通过总结评比，大力表扬奖励先进人物，树立先进旗帜。在这个基础上制订了民主管理制度和模范社员十二条的标准，使干部和群众都有一个明确的努力方向。
    杨梅连在贯彻管理民主化中，实行五天一谈心，主要是社员谈对生产、生活的意见和要求，有什么提什么。干部从谈心会中听到社员对公共食堂有意见，便立即召开食堂评比现场会议，检查出食堂办得不好，主要原因是没有加强领导，管理人员服务态度不好，副业搞得少等。于是，党组织指定一个连长专管食堂，每个食堂都有一个副排长当组长。同时，大搞副业，种菜三十亩、养猪六十只、养鸡四百只。做到茶滚饭热，菜色多样，还设立小卖部，方便社员，同时做到座位舒适又讲卫生，社员很为满意。
    杨梅连还在田头和食堂等地发动社员写大字报、画漫画，让社员们在那里充分发表意见。这对干部的教育很大。原来作风不好的都有了很大的改变，比如旧西排食堂有一张大字报是送给连长梁伯南的，写着：“伯南哥，全变样，过去日日忙在连部，现在时刻忙在田头；过去工作只会吹牛，现在真正动口又动手；过去不问社员生活事，现在关心社员如自己；过去自会督人做，现在样样都带头。”有的人还作歌唱道：“红一片，绿一片，千颗红心连一片，建设天堂齐向前！”
    连里的重大工作任务和生产计划，都广泛发动社员讨论、提意见。最近连部把明年早造的生产计划交群众讨论后，不仅使计划成为社员的要求；而且社员们提出了很多有益的建议，把计划修订得更积极可靠。如干部没有打算在深耕中结合烧土，社员提出了烧土可以增加氮肥；又如，干部规划解决土名塘裂坑的自流灌溉问题时，需用五亩田来挖平塘，社员提出开环山沟引水库的水灌田办法，既不用挖塘，又节省了劳动力。
    杨梅连实行管理民主化后，干部作风转变，干群关系更加密切。由于干部能经常依靠社员，相信社员，社员也很服从领导，生产积极性主动性大大提高。李用娥对排长说：“不论什么工作，不管如何艰苦，只要分配给我，我都保证完成。”
    本报讯  河南许昌县尚集人民公社党委会最近在全社开展关于群众路线工作方法的大辩论，用先进典型教育干部搞好民主管理。在大辩论中，大家一致认为这个公社的宋庄大队支部书记宋廷献贯彻执行群众路线工作方法是比较好的。例如在深翻土地刚开始时，不少社员认为炼钢炼铁这样忙，翻小块卫星田可以，要是把所有麦地都翻一遍，麦子就要种到过年啦！因而他们主张用牲口犁个七、八寸深就行了。宋廷献耐心地诱导群众进行讨论，用许多翻耕增产的事实说明深耕的好处，使大家都认识到深翻土地对保证明年小麦丰收的重要，纷纷自动地搬到田里，吃住在地，不到二十天，就把全部麦田都深翻了一遍。在收藏红薯时，宋廷献开始也有些发愁，认为那么多的红薯，窖没收拾好，劳力也不足，怎样收藏？但经过认真发动社员进行研究，特别是召开了老农座谈会，想出了解决问题的办法。在开始刨红薯后，有的社员看到把地里的红薯全部运到村里储存，要浪费很大劳力，便提议：高地红薯可以就地挖窖，就地保管。宋廷献立即采纳了这个建议，因而节省了许多人力和畜力，提前完成了收藏任务。由于全队在宋廷献的领导下，上下一心积极生产，粮食、烤烟、芝麻等各项作物的产量都增产了，最低的比去年增产两倍，多的增加到八倍。成为全社各项作物的最高丰产队。
    与宋廷献的工作作风完全相反的是这个公社的西街生产队长田宏宾。他在工作中主观武断，不和群众商量，工作方法简单粗糙，脱离了群众。例如今年收摘烟叶时，群众建议要抽一定劳动力烤烟，他不听，以致耽误了烤烟季节，使烟叶损坏了一部分。后来，受到上级的批评，他又让全部劳动力都投入烤烟。但因为事前准备不好，炕房不够，收回来的烟叶由于烤不及，又损坏一部分。由于他作风不民主，这个队的社员生产情绪不高，种麦时，种的既慢，质量又差，被评为全社的落后队。
    这一鲜明的对立面摆出后，干部和社员都就脱离群众能不能搞好工作等问题，展开了热烈的辩论。大家一致认为：组织军事化的目的是为了提高劳动效率推动生产，干部必须学会更好地走群众路线，充分发扬民主，使大家真正心情舒畅，才能显示组织军事化的优越性。
    通过这样的对比讨论，大大提高了广大干部对走群众路线的认识，纷纷提出“学习宋廷献”的口号，大大加强了办好人民公社的决心。田宏宾和一些原来作风不民主的干部，都向群众检查了以往的错误，纷纷表示今后要坚决走群众路线，彻底转变作风。广大社员对于干部作风的转变，都表示十分满意，生产情绪更加高涨。  （阚枫）
