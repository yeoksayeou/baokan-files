Changning County Achieves Great Development in Diversified Economy
Grasp key issues for debate, unify ideological understanding; rationally arrange labor according to the specific conditions of mountainous and plain areas, and comprehensively organize production; promote good experiences, advocate new technologies, and increase the unit yield of cash crops.

(Our Correspondent Tian Lianggeng reports) Changning County, Yunnan Province, has made remarkable achievements in diversified operations, becoming a banner for the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture.

Most of Changning County is mountainous, suitable for developing diversified operations. In the past, great achievements were made in developing diversified operations. However, due to the tight labor force this year, there has been a phenomenon of neglecting diversified operations. In response to this situation, the county party committee first mobilized the masses to conduct debates. The content was: Is diversified operation good or single-handed operation good? After airing views and debates, the understanding was unified, and a comprehensive leap forward target was formulated, proposing the measures of "three great leaps forward in grain, animal husbandry, and cash crops." Now, the county has 590,000 mu of large and small spring crops mainly consisting of grain and rapeseed, 70,000 mu of subtropical cash crops mainly consisting of cotton, sugarcane, and coffee, and 210,000 mu of economic forests mainly consisting of tea and walnuts. The area of these cash crops has expanded by about 50% compared to last year, and increased by two to fourteen times compared to before the development of diversified operations. The county's animal husbandry has also developed rapidly.

In carrying out diversified operations, Changning County has explored a set of experiences in both leadership methods and labor arrangements. They adopted the leadership method of fixing the top and not fixing the bottom, that is, the leading institutions and personnel are fixed, and the labor force is not fixed. Members of the county party committee are responsible for grain, subtropical cash crops, economic forests, animal husbandry and other production respectively. Specialized agencies and working groups were established to guide and inspect various production tasks. Each district, commune, and team is also equipped with professional leading cadres to be responsible for each aspect. The required labor force is allocated at any time according to the situation. In this way, when the county party committee focuses on grasping a certain production task in a certain period, other production will not be neglected or relaxed, ensuring comprehensive development and a comprehensive leap forward. In the organization and arrangement of labor, Changning County has adopted five methods. First, combining the plain area and the mountainous area. Among the sixteen people's communes in the county, fifteen have both mountains and plains, with subtropical, temperate, and frigid climates. The crops in each area are different, and the growing seasons are different, which provides favorable conditions for the allocation of labor. For example, when cotton is being cultivated in the middle season, more labor is needed, while the mountainous area has just finished planting corn, so the commune members in the mountainous area go to the plains to help with cotton cultivation; afterwards, they go back to the mountains to cultivate corn in the middle season, so neither task is delayed. Second, combining the perennial fixed professional technical team with mobilizing the masses for concentrated efforts. The county is divided into five teams throughout the year, of which industry accounts for 25% of the total labor force in the county, grain accounts for 38%, cash crops account for 18%, animal husbandry accounts for more than 13%, and sideline occupations account for 5%. If any kind of production is tight, labor will be mobilized to make a concentrated effort on that kind of production. Third, combining the centralized management of communes and teams with the production of commune members using spare time. All livestock in the county are collectively raised by the commune. In addition to the commune providing feed and the breeders collecting wild feed, commune members also use their spare time to plant angled luffa on the edges of fields and around houses. Fourth, technological innovation. Each production leadership system in the county has its own experimental fields. In these experimental fields, leaders personally create advanced experiences and then widely promote them. For example, due to the promotion of the advanced operation method of tea picking with both hands, the efficiency of tea pickers has generally increased by one to eight times, greatly saving manpower. Fifth, strong labor and weak labor are appropriately matched and used, such as most of the pig raising is done by the weak labor force.

In developing diversified operations, Changning County attaches great importance to cultivating a technical team and increasing the yield per unit area. In recent years, they have cultivated a large number of technical cadres in grain, subtropical cash crops, economic forests, and animal husbandry through holding training courses and visiting and learning from other places. These technical cadres have formed four technical networks in the county, ensuring the smooth development of various cash crops and animal husbandry. For example, the yield of cotton in 1954 was only more than 14 jin of ginned cotton per mu, but thanks to the help of technical cadres and the promotion of advanced experience, it has increased to 30 jin this year. The quality of tea has also been improving year by year, winning praise at home and abroad.

The development of diversified operations in Changning County has powerfully supported the country's industrial construction, enlivened the rural economy, and increased the income of farmers, especially the income of farmers in mountainous areas. Over the years, Changning County has supported the country's exports with a large number of black tea, walnuts, and pork, and has also supplied a large amount of cotton, sugar, cooking oil, and meat food to the needs of industrial and mining cities. This year, the materials that have been transferred and will be transferred, such as tea, oil, cotton, and pork, amount to 4.55 million yuan, an increase of one time over the same period last year. The development of diversified operations has also stimulated the further development of agriculture and industry. This year, more than 600 new agricultural and sideline native product processing plants have been established in the county, such as oil extraction, sugar making, cotton ginning, and meat food processing plants.

In addition, the living standards of farmers have also been further improved. From January to August this year, the income from the sale of pigs alone increased by an average of 36 yuan per household. The deposits of farmers in credit cooperatives have more than doubled compared to the same period last year.

Changning County will carry out a greater variety of agricultural operations on a larger scale next year. Under the principle of planting less, producing more, and harvesting more, the basic farmland system will be implemented, and the area of cash crops such as cotton, tea plantations, walnuts, oil crops, and coffee will be increased by 30% to nearly two times compared to this year. At the same time, efforts will be made to double the yield per unit area. (Attached picture)

Yanggu County, Shandong Province, has established nearly 10,000 pig, cattle, and chicken farms. There are now 330,000 chickens in the county, and it is striving to develop to 3 million by the end of the year. This is a group of chickens raised collectively and newly hatched chicks.

    昌宁县多种经济大发展
    抓住关键问题辩论，统一思想认识；根据山区平坝具体条件，合理安排
    劳力，全面组织生产；推广好经验，提倡新技术，提高经济作物单位产量。
    本报讯  记者田良耕报道：云南昌宁县多种经营，取得显著成绩，成为德宏傣族景颇族自治州的一面红旗。
    昌宁县大部是山区，适宜发展多种经营。过去在开展多种经营上，曾经取得很大成绩。但因今年劳动力紧张，产生了忽视多种经营的现象。根据这一情况，这个县的县委首先发动群众进行辩论。内容是：是多种经营好还是单打一好。经过鸣放辩论，统一了认识，制定了全面跃进的指标，提出了“粮食、畜牧业、经济作物三大跃进”的措施。现在，这个县已有以粮食、油菜为主的大小春作物五十九万亩，以棉花、甘蔗、咖啡为主的亚热带经济作物七万亩，以茶叶、核桃为主的经济林木二十一万亩。这些经济作物的面积，比去年约扩大50％，比开展多种经营前分别增加了二倍到十四倍。这个县的畜牧业也有迅速发展。
    昌宁县在开展多种经营中，无论在领导方法上和劳动安排上，都摸索出了一套经验。他们采取了上定下不定，即，领导机构和人员固定，劳动力不固定的领导方法。由县委委员分别包干粮食、亚热带经济作物、经济林木、畜牧业等生产。并分别成立专门机构和工作组，指导和检查各项生产。各区、社、队，也各配有专业领导干部分别负责。所需劳动力，则按情况随时调配。这样，当县委在一定时期集中抓某项生产时，其他生产也不致忽略和放松，保证了全面发展全面跃进。在劳动力的组织和安排上，昌宁县采取了五种办法。第一、坝区和山区相结合。全县十六个人民公社中有十五个人民公社是有山有坝，有亚热带、温带和寒带三种气候。各个地区的作物不一样，生长季节不同，给劳动力的调配，提供了有利条件。比如，在棉花中耕时节，需要较多的劳动力，而山区正种完包谷，山区社员就下坝帮助棉花中耕；之后，再上山进行包谷中耕，两头都不耽误。第二、常年固定专业技术队伍与发动群众集中突击相结合。全县常年分为五支队伍，其中工业占全县劳动力总数的25％、粮食占38％、经济作物占18％、畜牧业占13％多、副业占5％。哪种生产紧张，就调动劳动力突击哪种生产。第三、社队集中经营与社员利用空闲时间生产相结合。全县的大小牲畜均由公社集体饲养，饲料除由公社供应和饲养员采集野生饲料外，社员还利用空闲时间，在田边地角、房前屋后种植洋丝瓜。第四、技术革新。全县各个生产领导系统，都有自己的试验田。在这些试验田中，领导都亲自动手，创造出先进经验，再普遍推广。比如由于双手采茶先进操作法的推广，使采茶工效普遍提高了一至八倍，大大节约了人力。第五、强劳动力和弱劳动力适当配合使用，如养猪大部都由弱劳动力担任。
    昌宁县在开展多种经营中，十分重视培养技术队伍、提高单位面积产量。几年来，他们通过举办训练班、到外地参观学习等办法，培养了大量的粮食、亚热带经济作物、经济林木、畜牧业等技术干部。这些技术干部，在全县组成了四套技术网，保证了各种经济作物和畜牧业的顺利发展。如棉花的产量，1954年每亩仅产皮棉十四斤多，但由于技术干部的帮助，推广了先进经验，今年便提高到三十斤。茶叶的质量也逐年提高，博得国内外好评。
    昌宁县开展多种经营，有力地支援了国家的工业建设，活跃了农村经济，而且增加了农民的收入，特别是山区农民的收入。历年来，昌宁县都以大批红茶、核桃、猪肉等支援国家出口，还以大量的棉花、糖、食油、肉食品等供应工矿城市的需要。今年已调和即将调出的茶、油、棉、猪肉等物资，达四百五十五万元，比去年同期增加了一倍。多种经营的开展，也刺激了农业和工业的进一步发展。今年，全县新办起的农副土特产品加工厂就有六百多座，如榨油、制糖、轧花、肉食品加工厂等。
    此外，农民的生活水平也有了进一步的提高。今年1至8月，全县仅出售猪的收入，每户平均增加了三十六元。农民在信用社的存款，比去年同期增加了一倍多。
    昌宁县明年将以更大的规模开展农业上的多种多样的经营。在少种、高产、多收的原则下，实行基本农田制，把棉花、茶园、核桃、油料作物、咖啡等经济作物面积，分别比今年增加30％到近二倍，同时，单位面积产量也力争成倍增长。（附图片）
    山东阳谷县已建立猪、牛、鸡、免等饲养场近万个。现在全县共有鸡三十三万只，到年底争取发展到三百万只。这是集体饲养的鸡群和刚孵出的小鸡。
