Xinhua News Agency, December 26th—The Chinese Musicians Association held a concert yesterday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of Zhang Shu, an outstanding modern Chinese composer. Guo Moruo, Liu Zhiming, Tian Han, Lü Ji, He Luting and others attended the concert.

Tian Han introduced Zhang Shu's life at the meeting. Zhang Shu was not only an outstanding modern Chinese composer, but also a revolutionary activist. In his short life, he created many songs, including more than 200 songs for national salvation. Songs such as "Hong Bo Qu," "Drive Away the Wolves," "Husbands Go to War," and "The Sun Sets in the West" were widely circulated among the masses during the War of Resistance Against Japan. His creations were rich in strong national and folk characteristics, vigorous and powerful, and full of combativeness, which were loved by the masses.

During the Kuomintang rule, Zhang Shu was arrested and imprisoned twice. After being released from prison in 1932, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Under the leadership of the Party, he used music as a weapon to wage a firm struggle against the enemy.

Zhang Shu died in Guilin in December 1938 during an air raid by Japanese imperialist planes.

The Capital National Government Organs Amateur Chorus, the Beijing Children's Palace Friendship Chorus, the Central Broadcasting National Orchestra, and others performed 24 of Zhang Shu's posthumous works, including "Hong Bo Qu."

    纪念作曲家张曙逝世二十周年
    音乐家协会举行音乐会
    新华社26日讯  中国音乐家协会昨天举行音乐会，纪念我国近代优秀作曲家张曙逝世二十周年。郭沫若、刘芝明、田汉、吕骥、贺绿汀等出席了音乐会。
    田汉在会上介绍了张曙的生平。张曙不只是我国近代优秀的作曲家，也是革命活动家。他在短短的一生里，创作了很多歌曲，其中仅救亡歌曲就有二百多首。他所写的“洪波曲”、“赶豺狼”、“丈夫去当兵”、“日落西山”等，在抗日战争期间，曾在群众中广为流传。他的创作富有浓厚的民族、民间色彩，又雄壮有力，富于战斗性，受到群众的喜爱。
    在国民党统治时代，张曙曾两次被捕入狱。1932年出狱后，他光荣地参加了中国共产党。在党的领导下，他用音乐作武器，和敌人进行了坚强的斗争。
    张曙是1938年12月在桂林日本帝国主义飞机空袭时遇难的。
    音乐会由首都国家机关业余合唱团、北京少年宫友谊合唱团、中央广播民族管弦乐团等演唱张曙遗作“洪波曲”等二十四首。
