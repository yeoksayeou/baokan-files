Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: The currency free convertibility measures implemented by many Western European countries have opened the prelude to a major economic and trade war in the capitalist world. This situation has triggered different reactions in the countries concerned due to their different economic strengths and positions.

British newspapers, in their commentaries, linked these measures with the entry into force of the "Common Market" agreement on January 1, 1959, and did not hide their concerns that these measures would sharpen the economic contradictions of Western European countries. A commentator in the Labour Party newspaper "Reynolds News" pointed out that the devaluation of the franc was a measure taken by France to increase exports and significantly lower export prices. For Britain, this means that "France will intensify competition, especially in the automotive and textile industries."

"Reynolds News" also worriedly pointed out that "France is rapidly moving towards establishing a monetary union with Germany (West Germany)" in order to "squeeze Britain out of the European market."

Some British newspapers also did not hide that Britain's announcement of the pound's free convertibility was intended to打击 "Common Market" and realize its "free trade zone" plan. A "Sunday Times" commentator wrote, "The ultimate goal of these measures is to establish a free trade zone, because the freely convertible pound is a fully universal foreign exchange for all participating countries in this trade zone."

However, given Britain's insufficiently strong economic strength and position, many commentators, even politicians, are worried that Britain's measures will eventually backfire. "Reynolds News" wrote, "Britain does not have sufficient gold and dollar reserves. After a short period of smooth operation with free convertibility, it is entirely possible to be in the situation after 1925, that is, in order to try not to deplete gold reserves, the result is unemployment and recession." Labour leader Gaitskell expressed the same view.

West Germany, with its strong economic strength and abundant foreign exchange reserves, expressed happiness at the "move towards free convertibility" of Western European currencies. This will greatly benefit West German goods in competing in a more "free" Western European market. The "Sunday World" published in Hamburg called the new Western European currency measures a "victory" for the West German government's policy, because West Germany "has been fighting for the free convertibility of currencies for several years." The "Sunday Illustrated" even boasted that the date of implementing partial currency free convertibility was "one of the most important days in modern European history."

According to Agence France-Presse, currency free convertibility has little impact on West Germany, because compared with the US dollar and the Swiss franc, the West German mark "already has the conditions for implementing external free convertibility."

At the same time, Agence France-Presse reported that the West German state joint banks will provide France with a long-term loan of 250 million marks to "support" the monetary measures taken by France.

Italy expressed dissatisfaction with what its two "allies," West Germany and France, did behind its back. The Italian newspaper "Il Tempo" said that Italian economic experts felt "unpleasantly shocked" that France and West Germany did not consult with Italy before agreeing to take the current currency measures.

Norwegian Minister of Commerce Skaug said at a press conference on the 27th: The "new Western European (currency) agreement" replacing the "European Payments Union" "will have a serious impact on Norway's economic position. Our export trade will soon feel a more severe competitive climate."

The US government has not yet formally responded to the economic warfare in Western Europe. However, according to news from Washington, US officials are pleased with the opportunities for trade expansion in Western Europe provided by Western European currency free convertibility.

### 西欧卷起货币自由兑换之风  资本主义世界经济混战序幕揭开  有关各国反应不一  互相之间猜忌益深

    西欧卷起货币自由兑换之风
    资本主义世界经济混战序幕揭开
    有关各国反应不一  互相之间猜忌益深
    新华社29日讯  西欧许多国家实行的货币自由兑换措施，揭开了资本主义世界一场经济和贸易大混战的序幕。这个局面在有关国家中由于它们的经济实力地位不同，而引起了不同的反应。
    英国报纸在评论中把这种措施同1959年1月1日“共同市场”协定生效联系起来，并且毫不掩饰，它们担心这些措施会使西欧国家的经济矛盾更加尖锐化。合作党报纸“雷诺新闻”的评论员指出，法郎贬值是法国为了增加出口额和大大降低出口价格而采取的措施。对于英国来说，这意味着“法国将加紧竞争，特别是在汽车工业和纺织工业方面”。
    “雷诺新闻”还担心地指出，“法国正在迅速地走向同德国（西德）建立一个货币同盟”。以便把英国“挤出欧洲市场”。
    某些英国报纸也不掩饰，英国宣布英镑自由兑换一事是为了想打击“共同市场”和实现它的“自由贸易区”计划。“星期日泰晤士报”评论员写道，“这种措施最终的目的是要建立自由贸易区，因为自由兑换的英镑是这个贸易区所有参加国的完全通用的外汇”。
    但是，鉴于英国经济实力地位不够强固，许多评论员、甚至政界人士也担心，英国的措施最终会使它搬起石头打自己的脚。“雷诺新闻”写道，“英国没有足够的黄金储备和美元储备。在自由兑换的短时期的顺利情况之后，完全可能处于1925年之后的那种状况，即为了设法不使黄金储备枯竭，结果造成了失业现象和衰退现象。”工党领袖盖茨克尔表示了同样的看法。
    经济实力雄厚并拥有充足的外汇储备的西德对于西欧货币“正在走向自由兑换”表示高兴。因为这将大大有利于西德货物在一个更加
  “自由”的西欧市场上进行竞争。在汉堡出版的“星期日世界报”把西欧的新货币措施叫做西德政府政策的“胜利”，因为西德“几年来一直在为争取货币的自由兑换而奋斗”。“星期日画报”甚至大吹大擂地把实行部分货币自由兑换的日期叫做“现代欧洲历史上最重要的日子之一”。
    据法新社指出，货币自由兑换对于西德的影响很小，因为同美元和瑞士法郎比较，西德马克“早就具备了实行外部自由兑换的条件”。
    同时，法新社报道说，西德各州联合银行将向法国提供两亿五千万马克的长期贷款以“支持”法国所采取的货币措施。
    意大利对于它的这两个“盟友”西德和法国背着它干的事情表示不满。意大利“时代报”说，意大利的经济专家们对于法国和西德不同意大利进行磋商就协议采取目前的货币措施感到“不愉快的震惊”。
    挪威商务大臣斯科格在27日的记者招待会上说：代替“欧洲支付同盟”的“新的西欧（货币）协定，将对挪威的经济地位产生严重的影响。我国的出口贸易很快就会感受到更加恶劣的竞争气候”。
    美国官方对西欧的经济混战还没有正式反应。但是，据来自华盛顿的消息说，美国官员对因为西欧货币自由兑换而提供的向西欧进行贸易扩张的机会表示高兴。（附图片）
