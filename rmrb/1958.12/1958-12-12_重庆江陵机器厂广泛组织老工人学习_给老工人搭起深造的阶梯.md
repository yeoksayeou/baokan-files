Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory Widely Organizes Old Workers to Study
    Building a Ladder for Old Workers to Pursue Advanced Studies
    (Our newspaper reports) The Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory Party Committee attaches particular importance to the scientific and cultural studies of old workers while running schools on a large scale. At present, most of the five or six hundred old workers in this factory have participated in learning. Some old workers are studying in the secondary vocational classes of the half-work, half-study school, and a group of old workers with lower cultural levels are studying culture in old worker classes.
    The Jiangling Machine Factory Party Committee had previously run technical and cultural study classes for old workers. However, due to a lack of specific measures, the old workers were called back to the workshop when production was busy. Therefore, the learning was intermittent. After the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee held an education work conference in July this year, the factory's Party Committee became more clear about the issue of cultivating old workers, seeing both the present and the future. It was decided to widely organize old workers to participate in spare-time school studies, and at the same time, to open a half-work, half-study school, with a certain number of old workers drawn from each workshop to participate in learning.
    In September, when the Party Committee organized workers to discuss the Party's education policy, workshop cadres heard that old workers were to be drawn out to study, and there was much discussion. They were worried that the withdrawal of old workers would affect the completion of production tasks. Some said: "Taking away an old worker is like removing an arm." Some said: "There is a lot of new product trial production, and we can't do without the old workers."
    In order to enable everyone to correctly understand the relationship between production and learning, the factory Party Committee decided to launch a major debate. Before the great debate, the factory Party Committee sent a working group to understand the situation in the Second Workshop. This workshop has 380 employees. This year's production tasks have doubled compared to last year, and more than 100 workers have already been transferred out. From the situation at the time, it seemed very difficult to draw more people to study. However, after the working group's investigation and the mobilization of workers to launch a debate, the main reasons for the labor shortage were found: cadres had conservative ideas of "production reaching the top, potential exhausted," and the allocation of labor had not yet broken the rules. After the Party Committee found the main ideological obstacles of the workshop cadres, it led the workers to carefully calculate the accounts. Through careful calculations, the workers realized that old workers are the backbone of the factory and have rich production experience. After they improve their scientific and cultural level, they can better promote production development. Therefore, their learning is even more important. The workers' understanding was improved, and they fully supported the transfer of old workers to study.
    Immediately afterwards, the Party Committee began to solve some specific difficulties existing in the workshop. The first problem encountered was: there are few old workers, and if they are drawn out for half-work, half-study, the workshop's production must be properly arranged. While the workshop leaders were specifically adjusting and arranging production, the old workers also tried to create learning conditions. Some old workers trained apprentices to replace their work. Some old workers actively modified machine tools, changing manual operation to machine operation, and helped new workers improve production efficiency. Inspector Hu Huanbin summarized his inspection methods into a set of operating procedures so that more people could master this work. He also improved two methods for inspecting bearings, one of which can increase work efficiency by 25%. Another problem was: the cultural level of old workers is low, and they are afraid of not passing the exam. The Party Committee decided that old workers can be admitted without examination, as long as the masses agree through discussion, and the workshop leaders and Party Committee approve. Some old workers first improve their culture at the half-work, half-study school, and then study professional courses. Another problem was that some old workers have economic difficulties, and their enrollment may affect their family life. The Party Committee proposed that when the factory recruits contract workers, it should give priority to the family members of old workers; those with greater difficulties should be given appropriate subsidies. Old workers also try to actively find ways to save expenses and properly arrange family life.
    In the two months or more that the old workers of this factory have been studying at the half-work, half-study school, they have conquered all kinds of difficulties in learning; and they have quickly applied the knowledge they have learned to production. Old fitter Luo Shuming recently used the triangle principle to compile an empirical formula for quickly determining the diameter of a drill bit. When working, the diameter of the drill bit can be calculated by looking at this formula, without having to ask a technician to calculate or look up the work manual, which greatly saves auxiliary time. Old worker Su Xiangyun used geometric knowledge to create a kind of drill bit grinding alignment plate. Using the alignment plate to control the ground drill bit, the angle is accurate and the quality is high; in the past, drill bits were generally ground based on experience, and a slight difference would result in a waste product. After studying mathematics, physics, chemistry and other knowledge, many old workers can already draw sketches and use the formulas they have learned to calculate commonly used data in their work.

### 重庆江陵机器厂广泛组织老工人学习  给老工人搭起深造的阶梯

    重庆江陵机器厂广泛组织老工人学习
    给老工人搭起深造的阶梯
    本报讯  重庆江陵机器厂党委在大办学校中特别重视老工人的科学文化学习。目前，这个工厂的五、六百个老工人大都参加了学习。一部分老工人在半工半读学校的中专班学习，文化程度低的一批老工人在老工人班学习文化。
    江陵机器厂党委过去曾经为老工人办过技术文化学习班。但是，由于缺乏具体措施，生产一忙，就把老工人叫回车间。因此，学习时断时续。今年7月，中共重庆市委召开教育工作会议以后，这个厂的党委对于培养老工人的问题，思想上更加明确了，既看到了今天，也看到了明天。决定广泛组织老工人参加业余学校学习，同时开办半工半读学校，由各车间抽出一定数量的老工人参加学习。
    9月间，党委组织工人讨论党的教育方针时，车间干部听说要抽老工人学习，就议论纷纷。他们担心抽走了老工人，会影响生产任务的完成。有的说：“抽掉一个老工人，等于去掉了一条臂膀。”有的说：“新产品试制多，离不开老工人。”
    为使大家正确理解生产和学习的关系，工厂党委决定开展一次大辩论。在大辩论之前，工厂党委派工作组了解了第二车间的情况。这个车间现有职工三百八十人。今年的生产任务比去年翻一番，而且已有一百多个工人被抽调出来。从当时的情况看，再要抽人去学习似乎是很困难的。但是经过工作组调查，发动职工们展开辩论后，找出了劳动力紧张的主要原因：干部有“生产到顶，潜力挖尽”的保守思想，劳动力的调配还没有打破常规。党委找到了车间干部的主要思想障碍后，就领导职工们算细账。通过算细账，职工们认识到老工人是工厂的骨干，有丰富的生产经验，他们提高科学文化以后，就能更好地促进生产发展。所以他们的学习显得更加重要。职工们的认识提高了，便全力支持抽调老工人去学习。
    紧接着，党委就来着手解决车间存在的一些具体困难。首先遇到的问题是：老工人少，他们被抽出半工半读，就要妥善地安排车间的生产。在车间领导具体调整安排生产的同时，老工人们也设法创造学习条件。有些老工人培养徒弟代替自己的工作。有些老工人积极改装机床，改手工操作为机器操作，帮助新工人提高生产效率。检验工胡焕彬把自己的检验方法总结成一套操作规程，以便更多人能掌握这一工作。他还改进了两项检验轴承的方法，其中一项可提高工效25％。另一个问题是：老工人的文化水平低，他们怕考不上。党委决定，老工人入学可以不经考试，只要群众讨论同意，车间领导和党委批准。有些老工人先到半工半读学校提高文化后，再学习专业课。还有一个问题是，一部分老工人经济困难，他们入学后可能影响家庭生活。党委提出，工厂招收合同工时，尽量先招收老工人家属；困难大的适当给予补助。老工人也尽量主动设法节约开支，妥善安排家庭生活。
    这个厂的老工人在半工半读学校学习两个多月来，征服了学习上的种种困难；并且把学到的知识很快地运用到生产上。老钳工罗树明，最近运用三角形原理编了一个钻头直径快速决定的经验公式。工作时，一看这公式就可以算出钻头的直径，不必再找技术员计算或翻工作手册，大大节约了辅助时间，老工人苏祥云运用几何知识创制了一种磨钻头的对板，用对板掌握磨出来的钻头，角度准确，质量高；过去磨钻头一般是凭经验，差丝毫就成废品。许多老工人学习数学、物理、化学等知识后，已经会画草图，会运用学过的公式计算工作中一般常用的数据了。
