Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 17th: The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the requirements of simultaneously grasping production and livelihood and achieving three victories for industry, agriculture, and ideology, recently convened a conference in Changge County to specifically deploy winter rural work centered on the comprehensive rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the people's communes.

    The conference focused on studying the basic situation of the people's commune movement throughout the province and the work of vigorously rectifying, consolidating, and improving the people's communes. During the discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that in the two months since the realization of communization, the province had rapidly launched a mass upsurge in steelmaking for industrial construction and an agricultural production upsurge centered on deep plowing. Under the favorable situation of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, socialist and communist education was conducted, and the political consciousness of the vast number of commune members was raised. The people's communes are constantly being consolidated and strengthened. Communes in various places have generally formulated new rules and regulations, handled many outstanding economic issues, established management institutions, adjusted labor organizations, allocated cadres, and universally implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply, gradually putting the communes on the right track. In particular, in the past two months or so, various localities have universally strengthened the leadership of welfare undertakings, with public canteens as the mainstay, further promoting the improvement and consolidation of the people's communes. However, due to the short time since the establishment of the communes and insufficient summarization of advanced experiences, some new problems that are not adapted to the current situation still exist in the understanding of cadres and the masses, as well as in the distribution system, business management, livelihood and welfare, organizational leadership, and work style. Therefore, after carefully studying these problems, the conference believed that this winter and next spring, under the guidance of the policy of "taking steel as the key link, simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and achieving an all-round great leap forward," it is necessary to adhere to the working method of the mass line, extensively and deeply carry out the socialist and communist education movement, vigorously engage in agricultural production centered on wheat field management, vigorously develop diversified economies and local industries, and vigorously grasp livelihood and welfare. Through these tasks, a systematic rectification of the people's communes will be carried out to ensure three victories for industry, agriculture, and ideology.

    To conscientiously implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China throughout the province and universally and deeply carry out a socialist and communist education is the primary step in rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. The main content of this education is: to carry out the propaganda of the current political situation and tasks; education on the superiority of the people's communes and the communist prospects; to promote communist moral qualities and labor attitudes, criticize the remnants of bourgeois ideology, and carry out a large-scale movement to destroy the old and establish the new; to carry out class line education and improve class vigilance, etc. Through the above-mentioned education, party and league members will continue to promote the working methods and democratic style of the mass line, continue to promote the attitude of seeking truth from facts, and combine the style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act with the spirit of seeking truth from facts.

    In the process of comprehensively rectifying, consolidating, and improving the people's communes, vigorously grasping industrial and agricultural production and developing diversified economies is the material foundation for consolidating and improving the people's communes. Therefore, while vigorously grasping steel and industry, it is necessary to grasp agriculture. In the next four months, the first secretaries must spend a certain amount of time grasping agriculture and quickly launch an agricultural production upsurge centered on wheat field management to ensure a bumper wheat harvest next year. It is necessary to vigorously carry out the manure accumulation movement. To do the above work well, it is necessary to comprehensively arrange labor, vigorously organize specialized teams, and establish a responsibility system.

    This winter, it is also necessary to continue to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction on the basis of basically realizing step-by-step water conservancy last winter and this spring.

    While vigorously developing steelmaking, the people's communes must also vigorously develop other aspects of various local industries, develop diversified economies, and combine self-sufficient production with commodity production. By doing so, on the one hand, it can accelerate socialist construction and realize the industrialization of the communes; on the other hand, it can increase commune income and continuously improve the living standards of the commune members. The policy of developing county and commune industries is to serve industrial and agricultural production and to serve life. It is necessary to, in accordance with the national plan, boldly mobilize the masses, adapt to local conditions, use local materials, and produce locally. County and commune industries should have priorities and also be diversified.

    The conference also requested that party committees at all levels conduct a universal inspection of the commune's distribution work. Generally, the income of more than 90% of the commune members should be increased compared with last year, and the income of 10% of the commune members should not be reduced. When strengthening production management, financial management, and collective livelihood and welfare management, the people's communes must implement democratic management. Through extensive airing of views, great debates, and fully mobilizing the masses, tapping various production potentials, and promoting the spirit of continuous revolution, formulate prospective plans, annual and seasonal production plans. Major issues such as the commune's resolution of the financial system, the establishment of a financial system, the formulation of income and expenditure plans and distribution plans must be discussed and decided by the congress of commune members; major issues in the financial work of production teams and smaller production and construction units such as factories (fields) and mines should be decided by the congress of commune members of the unit. The same principle of democratic management should be implemented in terms of livelihood and welfare.

    The conference conducted in-depth research on the issue of grasping both production and life. Everyone believed that grasping production is to improve life. Grasping life, especially making the vast number of commune members sleep enough, eat enough, eat well, and dress warmly, can further improve labor efficiency and promote production. The conference also discussed the requirements for various standards on livelihood and welfare issues.

    The conference also focused on studying the work style and work methods of cadres under the situation of a comprehensive great leap forward, and unanimously believed that the work style of cadres throughout the province has been greatly improved in the past year. After the rectification movement, they liberated their minds and promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. In terms of work methods, the working method of implementing the party's mass line has also achieved great success in the past year. Mass movements have been launched in various tasks. Cadres appear as ordinary laborers, eating, living, working, and studying with the masses, and engaging in experimental fields to lead production with production. However, some cadres also have shortcomings in their style, such as only grasping production and not paying attention to life; failing to properly handle contradictions among the people by means of persuasion; and some cadres still have a boastful style. Although these shortcomings in style are small compared with the great achievements, they must be faced squarely. Party committees at all levels should conduct specific analysis and properly solve them. It is necessary to educate the vast number of cadres to combine revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, further implement the party's mass line, mobilize the masses, and strive for greater victories in various tasks.

    河南决定整顿提高人民公社
    保证工业农业思想三胜利
    据新华社郑州17日电  中共河南省委根据生产、生活一起抓好，工业、农业、思想三胜利的要求，最近在长葛县召开会议，具体部署了以全面整顿、巩固和提高人民公社为中心内容的冬季农村工作。
    会议集中研究了全省人民公社化运动的基本情况和大力整顿、巩固和提高人民公社的工作。在讨论中，大家一致认为实现公社化的两个多月中，全省就迅速掀起了全民大办钢铁的工业建设高潮，和以深翻土地为中心的农业生产高潮，在工农业生产大跃进的有利形势下，进行了社会主义和共产主义教育，提高了广大社员的政治觉悟。人民公社不断在巩固和加强，各地公社一般都制定了新的规章制度，处理了不少经济遗留问题，建立了管理机构，调整了劳动组织，调配了干部，普遍实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，使公社逐渐走上正规，尤其是最近两个多月来，各地普遍加强了以公共食堂为主的生活福利事业的领导，更促进了人民公社的提高和巩固。但是，由于公社建立时间短，对于先进经验总结的还不够，因而在干部和群众的认识上，在分配制度、经营管理、生活福利、组织领导、工作作风等方面，都还存在着一些与当前形势不相适应的新问题。因此，会议经过仔细研究这些问题以后，认为今冬明春必须在以钢为纲、工农业并举，全面大跃进的方针指导下，坚持群众路线的工作方法，广泛而深入的开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动，大搞以麦田管理为中心的农业生产，大力发展多种经济和地方工业，大抓生活福利。通过这些工作，对人民公社普遍进行一次系统的整顿，保证工业、农业、思想三胜利。
    在全省范围内认真贯彻中共中央指示，普遍地深入地开展一次社会主义和共产主义教育，是整顿和巩固人民公社的首要步骤，这一教育的主要内容是：进行当前政治形势和任务的宣传；人民公社优越性和共产主义远景的教育；发扬共产主义道德品质和劳动态度，批判资产阶级思想残余，开展大破大立运动；进行阶级路线和提高阶级警惕性的教育等。通过上述教育，使党、团员继续发扬群众路线的工作方法和民主作风，继续发扬实事求是工作态度，把敢想敢说敢干的风格与实事求是的精神结合起来。
    在全面整顿、巩固和提高人民公社的过程中，大力搞好工农业生产，发展多种经济，这是巩固和提高人民公社的物质基础。因此在大抓钢铁、大抓工业的同时，必须抓好农业。今后四个月，第一书记要用一定的时间抓农业，迅速掀起以麦田管理为中心的农业生产高潮，保证明年小麦大丰收。要大力开展积肥运动。为了做好上述工作，要全面安排劳力，大搞专业队，建立责任制。
    今冬还必须在去冬今春基本实现分步水利化的基础上，继续大搞水利建设。
    人民公社在大办钢铁的同时，还必须大力发展其他方面的各种地方工业，发展多种经济，把自给性生产和商品生产结合起来。这样做，一方面可以加速社会主义建设，实现公社工业化；另一方面，可以增加公社收入，不断提高社员的生活水平。发展县社工业的方针，是为工农业生产服务，为生活服务。要根据国家计划，放手发动群众，因地制宜，就地取材，就地生产。县社工业要有重点，也要多样。
    会议还要求各级党委对公社的分配工作要普遍进行一次检查。一般要使90％以上社员的收入比去年都有增加，10％的社员不减少收入。人民公社在加强生产管理、财务管理和集体生活福利管理的时候，必须实行管理民主化。通过大鸣大放大辩论，充分发动群众，挖掘各种生产潜力，发扬不断革命的精神来制订前景规划、年度和季节的生产计划。公社解决财务体制、建立财务制度、制订收支计划和分配方案等重大问题，必须经社员代表大会讨论决定；生产队和厂（场）矿等较小的生产建设单位财务工作中的重大问题，应由本单位社员大会来决定。在生活福利方面，同样要贯彻民主管理原则。
    会议对于既抓好生产又抓好生活的问题，进行了深入的研究。大家认为：抓好生产是为了改善生活。抓好生活，特别是使广大社员睡足、吃饱、吃好、穿暖，更可提高劳动效率，促进生产。会议上还讨论了有关生活福利问题上的各种标准的要求。
    会议还集中研究了在全面大跃进的形势下，干部的工作作风和工作方法问题，一致认为一年来，全省干部的工作作风有了很大的改进。经过整风运动，解放了思想，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。在工作方法上，一年来，贯彻党的群众路线的工作方法，也获得了很大胜利。各种工作都掀起了群众运动。干部以普通劳动者出现，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，大搞试验田，以生产领导生产。但是部分干部在作风上也存在缺点，如只抓生产，不注意生活；不能以说服的方法，正确处理人民内部矛盾；有的干部还有浮夸的作风，这些作风上的缺点与巨大成绩相比虽是微小的，但是必须正视。各级党委应当进行具体分析，妥善解决。要教育广大干部把革命热情和实事求是的精神结合起来，进一步贯彻党的群众路线，发动群众，争取各项工作的更大胜利。
