The working method of the Party's mass line is the lifeline of the people's commune; without the mass line, without the masses' full trust in the Party and the people's government, and without the upsurge of the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, the establishment and consolidation of the people's commune would be impossible. Therefore, the leading cadres at all levels of the commune must thoroughly implement the mass line in all their work. They must regard themselves as ordinary laborers and adopt a comrade-like attitude towards the commune members. It is strictly forbidden to treat the masses with the Kuomintang style and bourgeois style of suppressing the masses. Due to the great leap forward in production and the victory of communization, some cadres have become dizzy with success and are unwilling to patiently persuade and educate the people, showing some crude attitudes. Although this phenomenon is only individual, it must arouse serious vigilance.
                (Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes)
    
    Always Do Arduous Mass Work
    
    The 12th issue of "Liberation" magazine published an article written by Li Jiaqi entitled "Be Sure to Pay Attention to Working Methods." The article said: Since the Great Leap Forward, there are two points that everyone has felt more deeply: one is that the tasks are heavy, and the other is that the masses' awareness is high. Due to the heavy tasks, of course, we will encounter many difficulties; due to the high awareness of the masses, as long as we mobilize the masses, any difficulties can not stump us. In the face of heavy tasks, underestimating the increasingly high revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is often a reason for us to commit right-leaning conservative errors. However, if some of our comrades mistakenly believe that as long as the task is put forward, the masses will "respond to every call," and there is no need to do arduous mass work and in-depth investigation and research work, then, in practical work, a simplistic working style of issuing orders from top to bottom will inevitably grow.
    
    Some comrades say: "Now the masses have a lot of energy. As long as the Party calls, the masses will act. Is it necessary to emphasize working methods?" Yes, the masses are more aware and the work is easier to do. This is only one aspect of the problem. It only means that we have extremely favorable political conditions to do our job well, but it does not mean that we can pay less attention to or ignore working methods. The reason is very clear, as long as we are Marxists, we must admit that at any time there are always three states of advanced, intermediate, and backward within the people, and there are contradictions between the advanced and the backward. When a task is put forward, the advanced part of the masses always responds first, enthusiastically supports it, and consciously strives for its realization. However, those parts of the masses in the middle and backward state want to live a peaceful life and maintain individualistic thinking. Due to ideological reasons, they are not very conscious or active at the beginning. Our only correct approach is to firmly stand on the side of the advanced, and give play to their backbone, leading, and bridging role, and drive the intermediate and backward parts to move forward together. Some of our comrades' eyes are always easy to see the advanced part, but they do not go to or are unwilling to pay attention to those intermediate and backward parts, and often do not carry out in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work with them. The result of doing so will make the leadership alienated from the backward parts, and also make the advanced parts alienated from the backward parts, thereby deepening the contradiction between the leadership and the masses, and deepening the contradiction between the advanced and the backward.
    
    Some comrades may also think this way: "All our work is done entirely according to the instructions of the higher authorities. Even if the masses have opinions, they can't blame me!" The commentary pointed out: The guidelines and policies and various tasks put forward by the Party only represent the general direction and general requirements. How to combine the Party's guidelines and policies and tasks with the actual situation in our work to make specific measures and steps for implementation is the responsibility of all comrades who carry out practical work. At any time, the guidelines and tasks stipulated by the leadership cannot replace their specific work in implementation. "Things are uneven, and things have their own nature." In the same, we must pay attention to the difference. People have to wear clothes. This is a general topic, but when making clothes, we must consider whether the person wearing the clothes is tall or short, fat or thin, male or female, old or young. If we don't look at the specific object and don't ask about the specific situation, and make it in a general way, it will definitely be inappropriate and wrong.
  
  Adhere to the Working Method of the Mass Line
    
    The fifth issue of "New Analects" published a commentary entitled "Adhere to the Working Method of the Mass Line." When talking about carrying out mass movements on a large scale, the commentary said that the socialist revolution and socialist construction are related to the interests of the masses. It is difficult to achieve great achievements without mobilizing the masses, without mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and without launching vigorous and large-scale mass movements. Carrying out mass movements on a large scale is the normal order of revolution. The commentary pointed out that there are two types of people who oppose the mass line. One is people who have bourgeois ideas and are influenced by the bourgeoisie. They always want to live a peaceful life and maintain individualistic thinking, so they are very disgusted with mass movements. In fact, this kind of person needs to be tempered in mass movements, otherwise they cannot be transformed. The other is people who do not understand the importance of the mass line, thinking that economic construction does not require mass movements. They are usually ideologically conservative and follow the routine. When a movement comes, they feel that "the world will be in chaos." This kind of person should completely abandon their wrong ideas, otherwise they will be in a passive position before each movement. When talking about fully utilizing the methods of big contending, big blooming, big debate, and big-character posters, the commentary said that this method is a new development of the Party's mass line. With it, everything is easy to handle. However, some cadres have not recognized the importance of this working method of the mass line, and are still accustomed to the simple administrative command style. When they lead production, tasks, indicators, and measures are not taken to the masses for discussion and debate, and are not accepted by the masses. They simply ask the masses to implement them. On the surface, the masses are moving, but in reality, they are not moving, and the result is in vain. There are also individual cadres who turn the democratic method of big debate into a method of suppression, and only use it when "rectifying people" and "fighting people," resulting in the masses being afraid of big debate. These practices need to be corrected. When talking about caring for the lives of the masses, the commentary said that to gain the support of the masses, we must care about the pain and itching of the masses, and sincerely seek benefits for the masses, solve the production and life problems of the masses, and solve all the problems of the masses, especially after the establishment of the people's commune, the people have handed over the power of organizing production and life to us, which is of special and great significance. Here, we must pay attention to combining the organization of production with the organization of life; combining assault and rest, work and leisure, and tightness and slackness. Only in this way can we be worthy of being the organizers of production and life that the masses rely on.

### 群众路线是党的工作的生命线

专栏：在理论刊物上

    群众路线是党的工作的生命线
    党的群众路线的工作方法是人民公社的生命；没有群众路线，没有群众对党和人民政府的充分信任，没有群众的革命积极性的高涨，人民公社的建立和巩固是不可能的。因此，公社的各级领导工作人员，在任何工作中，都必须彻底执行群众路线。必须把自己看成是一个普通的劳动者，对于社员群众采取同志式的态度。严格禁止用那种压服群众的国民党作风、资产阶级作风来对待群众。由于生产的大跃进，由于公社化的胜利，某些干部开始冲昏头脑，对人民群众不愿意耐心地进行说服教育工作，而表现某种粗暴态度。这种现象虽然只是个别的，但是必须引起严重的警惕。
                （关于人民公社若干问题的决议）
    永远要作艰苦的群众工作
    “解放”杂志第十二期发表了李家齐写的“一定要讲求工作方法”一文。文章说：大跃进以来，有两点是大家感受得比较深刻的：一是各项任务重，二是群众觉悟高。由于任务重，当然会遇到许多困难；由于群众觉悟高，只要我们发动群众，任何困难也难不倒我们。在繁重的任务面前，过低估计了群众日益高涨的革命积极性，这常常是我们犯右倾保守错误的一个原因。但是，如果我们一些同志错误地认为只要把任务提出，群众就会“一呼百应”，不必再去做艰苦的群众工作和深入的调查研究工作了，那么，在实际工作中就必然会滋长自上而下发号施令的简单化的工作作风。
    有的同志这样说：“现在群众的干劲很足，只要党一号召，群众就行动起来了，强调工作方法有没有必要呢？”是的，群众觉悟高了，工作好做了，这只是问题的一方面。只是说，我们做好工作已经具备了极为有利的政治条件，而决不是说我们可以少注意或不注意工作方法。道理很清楚，只要我们是马克思主义者，我们就得承认在任何时候人民内部始终存在着先进、中间和落后三种状态，存在着先进与落后之间的矛盾。一项任务的提出，群众中先进的部分总是首先响应，热烈拥护，并自觉地为其实现而积极奋斗。但是那些处于中间和落后状态的一部分群众，想过着宁静的生活和保持着个人主义思想，由于思想认识上的原因，一开始的时候总还不很自觉不很积极。我们唯一正确的作法，就是坚定地站在先进的一方面，并且发挥他们的骨干、带头、桥梁作用，把中间、落后部分带动起来，一同前进。我们有些同志的眼睛总是容易看到先进的那一部分，而不去或不愿理睬那些中间、落后的部分，往往不是向他们进行深入细致的政治思想工作，这样做的结果，就会使领导脱离了落后的部分，也会使先进的部分脱离落后的部分，从而加深了领导与群众的矛盾，加深了先进与落后的矛盾。
    也会有一些同志这样想：“我们的一切工作都是完全照着上级的指示去办的，群众即使有意见，也不能怪我呀！”评论指出：党提出的方针政策和各项任务只是代表了总的方向，总的要求，如何根据党的方针政策和任务，结合自己工作中的实际情况，作出贯彻执行的具体措施和步骤，这是我们一切进行实际工作的同志的责任。在任何时候，领导上规定的方针任务决不能代替自己在执行中的具体工作。“物之不齐，物之性也”。在同一性中间，我们必须注意差异性。人要穿衣服，这是一个总题目，但是在做衣服的时候，就要考虑到穿衣服的人是高的还是矮的，胖的还是瘦的，男的还是女的，老的还是少的，不看具体对象，不问具体情况，笼笼统统去作，就一定不合适，不对头。
  坚持群众路线的工作方法
    “新论语”第五期以“坚持群众路线的工作方法”为题发表评论。在谈到要大搞群众运动时，评论说，社会主义革命和社会主义建设与群众利益攸关，不发动群众，不动员群众的积极性和创造性，不掀起轰轰烈烈、声势浩大的群众运动，是难于取得巨大成就的。大搞群众运动，正是革命的正常秩序，评论指出：有两种人反对群众路线。一种是具有资产阶级思想和受资产阶级影响的人，他们总想过着宁静的生活和保持着个人主义思想，因此对群众运动很反感。其实，这种人很需要在群众运动中受锻炼，否则就改造不过来。另一种是不懂得群众路线重要性的人，以为经济建设不需要群众运动，他们通常思想保守，按常规办事，运动一来，就觉得会“天下大乱”。这种人应该彻底抛弃他们的错误思想，不然，他们都会在每次运动前处于被动地位。在谈到要充分运用大鸣大放大辩论大字报的方法时，评论说，这种方法是党的群众路线的新发展，有了它，一切事情就好办了。但是有些干部却一直没有认识到这一群众路线的工作方法的重要性，还是习惯于简单的行政命令作风。他们领导生产时，任务、指标、措施不拿到群众中鸣放辩论，为群众所接受，简单的要群众去执行，表面上群众是动起来了，实际上没有动起来，结果落了空。还有的个别干部把大辩论这种民主方法变为压服的方法，只是在“整人”“斗人”时才加以运用，结果使群众害怕大辩论，这些作法都需要改正。在谈到要关心群众生活时，评论说，要得到群众的拥护，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题，解决群众的一切问题，特别在人民公社成立后，人民群众把组织生产和生活的大权都交给了我们，更有特殊重大的意义，在这里，要注意把组织生产和组织生活结合起来；把突击和休整、劳和逸、紧和弛结合起来，这才不愧为群众所依赖的生产和生活的组织者。
