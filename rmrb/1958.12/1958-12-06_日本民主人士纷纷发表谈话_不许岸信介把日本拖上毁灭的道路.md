Japanese Democrats Speak Out:
    Don't Allow Nobusuke Kishi to Drag Japan Down the Path of Destruction
    Hirano Yoshitaro: The Japanese people resolutely protest the Kishi government's hostile policies towards China and the Soviet Union.
    Kuroda: Japan should abolish the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and eliminate US military bases on its territory.
    Kaneda Tomitaro: Nobusuke Kishi's position violates the interests of the Japanese people and the people of Asia and Africa.
    Kazami Akira: The Kishi Nobusuke government willingly acts as an American partner in aggression, turning Japan into a slave of the United States.
    Koyama Shigeo: The Kishi Nobusuke government is nothing more than a "paper old cat," its life will not be long.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: TASS, Tokyo, December 4th: Japanese democrats are demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government seriously study the Soviet government's statement, believing that this statement raises issues of great significance for Japan.
    Hirano Yoshitaro, chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, wrote in the "Akahata" on the 4th that the Soviet proposal is in the interests of the Japanese people, because if war breaks out, Japan will be in danger of being bombed and destroyed by atomic bombs due to its "security treaty" with the United States, which is directed against the Soviet Union and China.
    Hirano emphasized that the Japanese people resolutely protest the government's hostile policy towards the two neighboring countries, and they are seriously considering the question of whether revising the "security treaty" and importing atomic weapons into Japan can guarantee peace and national security.
    Kuroda, permanent director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that the purpose of revising the "security treaty" is to drag Japan into an aggressive bloc and turn Japan into a permanent US military base.
    Kuroda emphasized that Japan should not revise the "security treaty," but should abolish it and eliminate US military bases on its territory. Japan should choose the path of neutrality. Only by pursuing a neutral policy can Japan guarantee its national security and win the trust of the people of Asia and Africa.
    Kuroda welcomed the Soviet statement, pointing out that it was made for the sake of Japan's security.
    Kaneda Tomitaro, vice chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that the US bases in Japan are daggers pointed at the Soviet Union and China, but the Kishi Nobusuke government is trying to hide this fact. Kaneda said that the Kishi Nobusuke government is trying to deceive the Japanese people who resolutely oppose the "security treaty." It hastily said that the Soviet statement was "interference in internal affairs" without even studying it. However, there is no interference in this statement. Kishi Nobusuke's position is an anti-people position and violates the interests of the people of Asia and Africa.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 5th, Tokyo Dispatch: Kazami Akira, director-general of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, and Koyama Shigeo, member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized the importance of the two statements issued by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi and the Soviet government respectively on the US-Japan negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty" in speeches to young students in Tokyo on the evening of the 4th.
    In a lecture organized jointly by the Youth Department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Kanto Regional University China Research Association Federation, Kazami emphasized that Japan has fallen into the status of a slave of the United States. The governments of China and the Soviet Union pointed out this fact with great sympathy in their statements, but the Kishi Nobusuke government insisted that this was "interference in Japan's internal affairs." He said that such sophistry that reverses right and wrong no longer works in the world.
    Kazami said that the Japanese people must now thoroughly understand the question of who is a friend and who is an enemy.
    Kazami pointed out to the more than one hundred young students attending the meeting that when the Soviet artificial satellite appeared, even some of the more enlightened Japanese capitalists admitted that capitalism was on the decline. He said that in this era where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the Kishi Nobusuke government is willingly turning itself into a partner of American imperialism in its aggression in Asia, which runs counter to history.
    Kazami called on the Japanese people to join hands with the Chinese people and launch a resolute joint struggle against the source of war—imperialism.
    In his speech, Koyama pointed out that the warnings of the Chinese and Soviet governments to the Kishi Nobusuke government were issued in a situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind. If the United States is a paper tiger, then the Kishi Nobusuke government is nothing more than a "paper old cat," and its life will not be long in the face of the strong unity and resolute opposition of the Japanese people.
    Koyama pointed out that Japan is in a dangerous situation on the edge of a cliff due to the attempt by Japan and the United States to revise the "Security Treaty."
    Koyama called on the Japanese people to strive to establish a national democratic united front for peace and independence and launch a strong struggle in order to smash the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    日本民主人士纷纷发表谈话
    不许岸信介把日本拖上毁灭的道路
    平野义太郎说：日本人民坚决抗议岸政府对中苏采取敌视的政策
    黑田说：日本应废除美日“安全条约”和取消领土上的美军基地
    兼田富太郎说：岸信介的立场违反日本人民以及亚非人民的利益
    风见章说：岸信介政府甘当美国侵略伙伴使日本成为美国的奴隶
    神山茂夫说：岸信介政府不过是一只“纸老猫”寿命是不会长的
    新华社5日讯  塔斯社东京4日讯：日本民主人士要求岸信介政府认真研究苏联政府的声明，他们认为这项声明提出了对日本有非常重大意义的问题。
    日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎4日在“赤旗报”上写道，苏联的建议符合日本人民的利益，因为一旦战争爆发，由于日本同美国缔结了矛头指向苏联和中国的“安全条约”，它将有受原子弹轰炸而遭到毁灭的危险。
    平野强调指出，日本人民坚决抗议政府对两个邻国采取敌视政策，他们正在严肃地考虑这一问题：修改“安全条约”和向日本输入原子武器是否能保证和平和国家安全。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会常任理事黑田说，修改“安全条约”的目的就是要把日本拖进侵略集团，并且把日本变为美国的永久性军事基地。
    黑田强调指出，日本不应当修改“安全条约”，而应当废除它，取消在本国领土上的美国军事基地。日本应当选择中立的道路。只有执行中立政策，日本才能保障国家的安全，才能博得亚非国家人民的信任。
    黑田欢迎苏联的声明，他指出，这项声明是为了日本的安全而作的。
    日本工会总评议会副议长兼田富太郎说，美国在日本的基地是指向苏联和中国的短剑，但是岸信介政府企图掩盖这个事实。兼田说，岸信介政府企图蒙骗坚决反对“安全条约”的日本人民，它还没有研究苏联的声明，就急忙说它是“干涉内政”。但是，这个声明里没有任何干涉。岸信介的这种立场是反人民的立场，是违背亚非国家人民利益的立场。
    新华社5日讯  东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章和日本共产党中央委员神山茂夫4日晚上在东京对青年学生发表演讲时，强调指出了中国外交部长陈毅和苏联政府分别就日美举行修改“安全条约”的谈判所发表的两项声明的重要意义。
    风见在这个由日中友好协会东京都联合会青年部和关东地方大学中国研究会联合会联合主办的讲演会上强调指出，日本已经陷入美国的奴隶的地位，中苏两国政府的声明以十分同情的态度指出了这个事实，但是岸信介政府却硬说这是“对日本内政的干涉”。他说，可是这种颠倒是非的谬论在世界上已经行不通。
    风见说，究竟谁是朋友谁是敌人，日本人民现在必须彻底认识清楚这个问题。
    风见向与会的一百多名青年学生指出，当苏联的人造卫星出现的时候，连一部分比较开明的日本资本家都承认，资本主义已经在走下坡路。他说，可是在现在这个东风压倒西风的时代里，岸信介政府却自愿变成美帝国主义侵略亚洲的伙伴，这是同历史背道而驰的。
    风见号召日本人民同中国人民携起手来，对战争的根源——帝国主义展开坚决的联合斗争。
    神山在讲演中指出，中苏两国政府对岸信介政府的警告，是在东风压倒西风的形势下发表的，如果说美国是一只纸老虎，那么岸信介政府不过是一只“纸老猫”，在日本人民坚强团结和坚决反对的情况下，它的寿命是不会长的。
    神山指出，由于日美企图修改“安全条约”，日本正处于悬崖上的危险局面。
    神山号召日本人民争取建立争取和平和独立的民族民主统一战线，展开强烈的斗争，以便粉碎日美“安全条约”。
