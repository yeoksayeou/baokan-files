Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Secretariat today published a statement in "Akahata" entitled "The Road for the Japanese People to Strive for Independence and Security," expressing welcome and support for the statements issued separately by the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the negotiations between the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States on revising the "Security Treaty," and calling on all Japanese people to fight for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to break the relationship that subordinates Japan to the United States.

The statement said that the statements of the Chinese and Soviet governments are full of the spirit of safeguarding peace in Asia, supporting the Japanese people's demands for independence, and the eternally unchanging friendship towards the Japanese people, and are also completely in line with the aspirations and interests of the Japanese people.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese people are currently facing a major situation in which they must choose between two paths: one is to bind Japan more tightly to the U.S. war policy through the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," thereby leading Japan to the path of destruction once again; the other is to clearly recognize the face of U.S. imperialism that is ravaging Japan's independence and security, strive to abolish the "Security Treaty," and promote Japan to become an independent Asian country that adopts an independent foreign policy.

The statement pointed out that at this time, not only the Japanese government, but all political parties, organizations, and all the people should seriously study the statements of China and the Soviet Union.

The statement then strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's slander that the statements of the Chinese and Soviet governments were "interference in Japan's internal affairs." The statement pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude does not represent the will of the Japanese people in the slightest, but rather expresses its panic.

The statement said that China and the Soviet Union have made many efforts to establish normal diplomatic relations and friendly relations with Japan, and this time they reiterated in their statements their hope for Japan's neutrality and expressed respect for Japan's neutrality, which is the greatest guarantee for Japan to get rid of its current environment and move towards ensuring Japan's security.

The statement pointed out that if Japan wants to get rid of its current national crisis, there is no other way but to change Japan's foreign policy of subservience to the United States and adopt a completely independent neutral policy.

The statement called on the Japanese people to launch a struggle to achieve the following goals:

	One, from demanding the cessation of the U.S.-Japan negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" to further demanding the abolition of this treaty, breaking the relationship of Japan's subservience to the United States, and striving to establish equal relations.

	Two, in order to strive for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations and friendly relations with China and the Soviet Union, immediately conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union and restore diplomatic relations with China.

	Three, do not allow Japan to participate in the conclusion of any military treaties and military alliances.

	Four, launch a struggle to urge the Kishi Nobusuke government to adopt the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in order to establish equal and friendly relations with all countries in the world, including China, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

The statement pointed out that these demands are indispensable and necessary conditions for Japan's peace, independence, and neutrality.

The statement stated that the Japanese Communist Party believes that, apart from a small handful of anti-national and anti-people forces, people of all strata in Japan, including ordinary members of the Liberal Democratic Party, will support these principles.

The Japanese Communist Party finally called on the Japanese people to unite with the people of the world to fight for peace and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party Parliamentary Group today published a statement in "Akahata," in which they firmly stated their resolve to fight to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and dissolve the Diet.

The statement pointed out that this regular session of the Diet is being held under the circumstances that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are attempting to implement a series of traitorous and reactionary policies, which have been resolutely opposed by the Japanese people, have been severely hit, and are experiencing internal turmoil and infighting.

The statement pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, under the guise of "normalizing the Diet," are attempting to surround the Socialist Party members in the parliament, create a wall between the people and the Diet, and take the opportunity to once again submit to the Diet and forcibly pass the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and the proposal to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and continue to attack the people.

The statement revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government is also preparing to submit to the Diet a series of reactionary bills centered on the 1959 fiscal year budget draft, such as the "Anti-Monopoly Law" amendment and the "Import and Export Trade Law" amendment.

The statement stated that the Japanese Communist Party will launch a resolute struggle together with the Japanese people to demand the cessation of negotiations on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government abolish this treaty, and change all other reactionary policies.

The statement stated that they believe that the great power of the people who crushed the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law" will surely achieve victory in this struggle.

The Japanese Communist Party Parliamentary Group firmly stated that, in order to strive for the establishment of a broad united front with the goal of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and dissolving the Diet, they will fight both inside and outside the Diet.

    日共号召人民争取废除日美“安全条约”
    中苏声明符合日本人民的愿望
    日共国会议员团表示要为打倒岸内阁和解散国会而斗争
    新华社11日讯  东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表了题为“日本人民争取独立和安全的道路”的声明，表示欢迎和支持中苏两国政府就岸信介政府同美国举行关于修改“安全条约”的谈判分别发表的声明，并且号召日本全体人民为争取废除日美“安全条约”和打断使日本从属于美国的关系而奋斗。
    声明说，中苏两国政府的声明充满了维护亚洲和平、支持日本人民争取独立的要求、对日本人民永远不变的友好精神，同时也是完全符合日本人民的愿望和利益的。
    声明指出，日本人民目前面临在这样两条道路中进行选择的重大局面：一条是通过日美“安全条约”的修改，把日本更紧地束缚在美国战争政策上，从而使日本再次走向灭亡的道路；另一条是辨别清楚蹂躏日本的独立和安全的美帝国主义的面貌，争取废除“安全条约”，促使日本成为一个采取自主外交政策的亚洲的独立国家的道路。
    声明指出，在这个时候，不仅日本政府，一切政党、团体和全体人民都应当认真研究中苏两国的声明。
    声明接着强烈谴责岸信介政府诬蔑中苏两国政府的声明是“干涉日本内政”的说法。声明指出，岸信介政府的这种态度丝毫也不代表日本人民的意志，相反地只是表示它的恐慌。
    声明说，中苏两国为建立同日本的正常邦交和友好关系做了不少努力，这次又在声明中重新表示希望日本中立，并且表示尊重日本的中立，这是对于日本摆脱目前所处的环境、走向确保日本安全的道路的最大的保障。
    声明指出，日本要摆脱目前的民族危机，除了改变日本的从属于美国的外交政策和采取完全自主的中立政策以外，是没有别的途径的。
    声明号召日本人民为实现下列目标而展开斗争：
    一、从要求停止举行修改“安全条约”的日美谈判进一步要求废除这项条约，打断日本从属于美国的关系，争取建立平等关系。
    二、为了争取同中苏两国建立正常邦交和友好关系，立即同苏联缔结和约，同中国恢复邦交。
    三、不许日本参与缔结任何军事条约和军事同盟。
    四、展开斗争，促使岸信介政府采取和平共处五项原则，以便同包括中、苏、美等国在内的全世界各国建立平等、友好关系。
    声明指出，这些要求对于日本的和平、独立和中立是不可缺少的必要的条件。
    声明表示，日本共产党相信，对于这些原则，除了一小撮反民族、反人民的势力以外，包括自由民主党的一般党员在内的日本各阶层人民都是会加以支持的。
    日本共产党最后号召日本人民为争取和平和独立，同全世界人民团结起来奋斗。
    新华社11日讯  东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团今天在“赤旗报”上发表声明，他们坚决表示要为打倒岸信介内阁和解散国会而斗争。
    声明指出，这次国会平时会议，是在岸信介内阁和执政的自由民主党企图实施一连串卖国的、反动的政策，因而遭到日本人民的坚决反对，受到了沉重打击，并且在内部发生动摇和内哄的情况下召开的。
    声明指出，岸信介内阁和自由民主党企图在“国会正常化”的幌子的掩饰下，把社会党议员围在议会里面，想在人民和国会之间制造一道墙壁，趁机再次向国会提出和强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”和修改日美“安全条约”的提案，继续向人民进攻。
    声明揭露，岸信介政府还准备向国会提出以1959财政年度预算草案为中心的一连串反动法案，比如“禁止垄断法”修正案、“进出口贸易法”修正案等。
    声明表示，日本共产党将同日本人民一起展开坚决斗争，要求停止修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，要求岸信介政府废除这项条约和改变其他一切反动政策。
    声明表示，他们相信粉碎岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”阴谋的人民伟大的力量，在这个斗争中必将取得胜利。
    日共国会议员团坚决表示，为了争取建立以打倒岸信介内阁、解散国会为目标的广泛的统一战线，他们将在国会内外奋斗。
