Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 11th: At the close of today's session of the All-African People's Conference, the Conference's Joint Secretary, McEwen, announced that a number of observers and fraternal delegates had come to participate in the Conference, including Yang Shuo, the Chinese representative from the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, who attended the conference meeting for the first time today.

Yang Shuo arrived in Accra on the 8th, but after discovering that the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek clique was flying next to the solemn national flag of the People's Republic of China, he did not attend the meeting.

In a letter to the Conference's General Affairs Committee, Yang Shuo stated that the Chinese people have consistently supported the struggle of the African peoples for independence. Premier Zhou Enlai's congratulatory telegram to the Conference is the best expression of the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the African peoples.

He expressed regret that the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek clique was flying next to the national flag of the People's Republic of China. He said: "Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. If it were not for the occupation by the American imperialists, Taiwan, Chinese territory, would have returned to the embrace of the motherland long ago. Only the People's Republic of China can represent the Chinese people. However, the imperialists have been trying their best to realize their conspiracy to create so-called 'two Chinas' in order to allow the American aggressors to permanently occupy Taiwan, Chinese territory. All friends of China should continue to be vigilant against this kind of conspiracy."

Yang Shuo demanded that the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek clique be removed immediately, and expressed his belief that the General Affairs Committee would support his just demand, just as the Chinese people have consistently supported the just struggle of the African peoples.

Thanks to the support of friends from various countries, the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek clique was removed.

After this, Yang Shuo attended the conference meeting.

    会场扯下蒋介石集团旗子
    我代表参加全非人民大会
    新华社阿克拉11日电  在全非人民大会今天的会议结束的时候，大会联合秘书麦克尤恩宣布一些观察员和兄弟代表已经前来参加大会，其中有亚非人民团结理事会书记处兄弟代表团中的中国代表杨朔，他今天第一次参加大会会议。
    杨朔是在8日到达阿克拉的，但是在他发现蒋介石集团的旗帜飘扬在中华人民共和国庄严的国旗旁边以后，就没有出席会议。
    杨朔在给大会总务委员会的信中说，中国人民一贯支持非洲各国人民争取独立的斗争。周恩来总理致大会的贺电就是中国人民对非洲各国人民深厚友谊的最好表现。
    他对于蒋介石集团的旗帜飘扬在中华人民共和国国旗旁边一事表示遗憾。他说：“台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。如果不是美帝国主义者的霸占，中国领土台湾早就回到了祖国的怀抱。只有中华人民共和国才能代表中国人民。但是帝国主义者一直在尽力实现它制造所谓‘两个中国’的阴谋，以便使美国侵略者永远霸占中国领土台湾。中国的一切朋友应该对于这种阴谋活动继续保持警惕。”
    杨朔要求立即拿掉蒋介石集团的旗帜，并且表示相信总务委员会将会支持他的正义要求，就像中国人民一贯支持非洲各国人民正义的斗争一样。
    由于各国朋友们的支持，蒋介石集团的旗帜被拿掉了。
    在这以后，杨朔参加了大会会议。
