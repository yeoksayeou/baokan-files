Underground Hot Water Sea
　　Jin Ming

　　Fifty-two years ago, Mr. Lu Xun translated Jules Verne's science fiction novel "Journey to the Center of the Earth," in which the author imagined a scorching ocean beneath the earth.

　　The Beijing Evening News on November 28 carried a news item: A subterranean hot water sea covering an area of 500 square kilometers has been discovered in the Kazakh region of the Soviet Union. Two years ago, such a hot water sea was also discovered under Tashkent.

　　The existence of invisible oceans underground has been proven by many facts. But why is the groundwater hot? Water only gets hot when heated on a stove, is there a stove underground? Yes, that's magma.

　　When a volcano stops erupting, it appears calm on the surface, but a large amount of high-temperature magma is still accumulated underground. This magma is like a huge furnace underground, baking the groundwater. If the magma gradually cools down, it will also condense a lot of hot water and add it to the groundwater. In some places, although the magma does not rush to the surface, it only moves underground, it still plays the role of a furnace.

　　Apart from the influence of magma, the deep underground is inherently hot, and it gets hotter the deeper you go. When groundwater flows through the deep underground, it also gets hot. Therefore, it is not surprising that hot water appears underground. In many places, we can find hot springs, which are hot underground water that automatically flows out along cracks. Sometimes, because the water is very hot, it constantly turns into steam underground, creating pressure, which causes the hot water and steam to spray into the sky, creating a magnificent scene.

　　These scorching hot springs and steam only escape when there is an opportunity in the earth's crust, but they are already widely distributed. China's Tibet, the Soviet Union's Kamchatka and Central Asia, Iceland, and the United States all have geysers, and there are even more ordinary hot springs. According to incomplete statistics, there are about 1,000 in China alone. If we open up passages for those hot water and steam that have no way out, such as drilling wells, more places can obtain natural hot water and steam. This hot water and steam can be used to supply heating, saving coal and effort. It has a more significant effect in those areas with severe cold climates. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria have already built a large number of greenhouses using underground hot water.

　　However, this way of using hot water and steam is limited to places near the hot water source, because the heat will be lost along the way if it is too far. If we can convert this heat into electrical energy, it will be more convenient to use.

　　According to calculations by Soviet scientists, the cost of generating electricity in this way is only one-tenth of that of a thermal power plant. At present, many countries have built or are building geothermal power plants. The Soviet Union has decided to build such a power plant in southern Kamchatka; in Italy in 1952, geothermal power plants accounted for 5.8% of the total power generation.

　　There are obstacles to using underground steam to generate electricity. Many underground hot water and steam contain a lot of minerals and gases, which can damage the machinery and must be removed. But on the other hand, these "harmful" things are also useful. Because the more minerals and gases in the underground hot water, the more it can be used to treat diseases, and the minerals can be extracted and used. You should know that these minerals also contain rare and precious things like radium!

　　The underground hot water sea is truly a treasure trove. We also have hope of finding such a treasure trove in China, because there is still volcanic activity in Taiwan, and there has been volcanic activity in Xinjiang after liberation. Other places such as Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan... etc. have all had volcanic activity in the recent history of the Earth. Although there are no volcanoes in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Tibet, there are many signs that there may be magma active deep underground. Therefore, our prospects for widely utilizing underground thermal energy are optimistic.

    地下热水海
    今明
    五十二年以前，鲁迅先生翻译了儒勒·凡尔纳的科学幻想小说“地底旅行”，在这本小说里，作者设想地下有着灼热的海洋。
    11月28日的北京晚报上刊登了一条消息：苏联哈萨克地区发现了一个面积达五百平方公里的地下热水海。两年以前，在塔什干的地下也曾发现这样的热水海。
    地下有着看不见的海洋，这是许多事实所证明了的。可是地下水为什么会热呢？水要在炉子上烧了才会热，地下也有炉子么？有，这就是岩浆。
    当火山停止喷发以后，表面上平静了，但在地下还蓄积着大量高热的岩浆，这些岩浆在地下好像一个巨大的火炉，烘烤着地下水，如果岩浆逐渐冷却，还会凝结出许多热水加入到地下水中去。有的地方虽然岩浆没有冲出地面，仅在地下活动，也一样起了炉子的作用。
    除开岩浆的影响外，地下深处本来就很热，而且是愈深愈热，当地下水流经地下深处时，也会变热。因此地下出现热水并不奇怪。许多地方我们都可以碰到温泉，这是地下热水沿着裂缝自动流出来的，有时由于水很热，在地下不断变成蒸汽，产生压力，使热水热汽喷向天空，成为瑰丽的景色。
    这些灼热的泉水、蒸汽仅仅是当地壳某处有隙可乘时才跑出来的，但已分布很广。我国的西藏、苏联的堪察加和中亚、冰岛、美国都有喷泉，至于一般的温泉就更多了。据不完全的统计，我国就约有一千处。如果我们给那些还没有出路的热水热汽开辟个通道，譬如说钻口井，更多的地方便能得到天然的热水热汽。这种热水和热汽可以用来供应暖气装置，省煤又省事。在那些气候严寒的地区更有显著的作用。苏联和保加利亚都已经利用地下热水大量建立温室。
    不过这样利用热水热汽，毕竟只限于靠近热水源的地方，太远了热就会沿途散失，如果我们能将这些热转化为电能，用起来就方便了。
    据苏联科学家计算，这样发电的成本，仅及火电站的十分之一。目前，许多国家都已经建成或正在建设利用地热的发电站。苏联已决定在堪察加南部修建这样的发电站；意大利1952年的全部发电量中，地热发电站发出的已占到5.8％。
    利用地下热汽来发电不是没有障碍的，许多地下热水热汽含有很多矿物质和气体，会对机器造成损害，必须加以清除。但是从另一方面来看，这些“有害”的东西却也是有用的东西。因为地下热水中的矿物质和气体多了，可以用来治疗疾病，还可以把矿物质等提取出来加以利用。要知道这些矿物质中还有镭这样稀有而珍贵的东西哩！
    地下热水海真是一个宝库。在我国也是有希望找到这样的宝库的，因为台湾现在还有火山活动，新疆在解放后也曾有过火山活动，其他如东北、内蒙古、云南……等许多地方在地球历史的最近时期都有过火山活动。陕西、甘肃和西藏虽然没有火山，但有许多迹象说明地下深处可能有岩浆在活动，因此我们广泛利用地下热能的前景是乐观的。
