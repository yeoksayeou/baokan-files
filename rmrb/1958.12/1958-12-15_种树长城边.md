　　Planting trees by the Great Wall
　　Li Chao
　　The greening army marches to the Great Wall,
　　The north wind whistles, chilling to the bone,
　　The ridges are high and steep, hard to climb,
　　But our heroic team members are no ordinary folk.
　　Not afraid of the cold wind and arduous roads,
　　The mountains may be high, but they cannot pierce the heavens,
　　Our enthusiasm for construction soars to the sky,
　　How can the cold overcome our firm will!
　　Cliffs and precipices where even birds and apes fear to tread,
　　Seed pellets are fired from bows and crossbows.
　　When spring warms the peaks and saplings appear,
　　Wisdom conquers nature.
　　Fish-scale pits are dug all over the mountains,
　　Carrying water and soil across the plains,
　　Planting trees by the thousands and millions,
　　Seeking the peaches of immortality here.
　　Planting trees and climbing the Great Wall,
　　Turning beacon towers into fertile fields,
　　The rolling logs and rocks are no longer seen,
　　Replaced by towering pines and cypresses instead of smoke.
　　The appearance of both sides of the Great Wall has changed,
　　People create green mountains with their hands,
　　Shouldering the responsibility of transforming the world,
　　Today's people stand at the forefront!

    种树长城边
    李超绿化进军长城边，北风飒飒透骨寒，岭高峰峻难攀登，英雄队员非等闲。那怕风寒路艰险，山高不能破九天，建设热情冲霄汉，冰冷怎胜意志坚！悬崖峭壁绝鸟猿，种子泥丸弓弩弹。春暖峦峰树苗现，智慧征服大自然。鱼鳞土坑掘满山，担水荷土履平川，栽植树木千千万，欲赴蟠桃在此间。种树攀登长城巅，锋火墩台作肥田，滚木礌石今不见，矗立松柏代狼烟。长城南北模样变，人们双手铸绿山，改造世界千斤担，当代人儿站前沿！
