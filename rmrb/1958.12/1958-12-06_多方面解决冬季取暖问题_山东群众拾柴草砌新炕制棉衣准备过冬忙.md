    Addressing Winter Heating Problems in Many Ways
    Shandong Masses Gather Firewood, Build New Kang Beds, and Make Cotton Clothes to Prepare for Winter

    (Our report) Following the instructions of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, Party organizations at all levels in Shandong Province, with the First Secretaries taking personal initiative, have mobilized the masses and devised various methods to resolve the problem of winter heating for the peasants. Currently, in some areas, all homes for the elderly, nurseries, maternity homes, and individual commune members' households can spend the cold winter warmly. After resolving this issue, the broad masses have greatly increased their enthusiasm, and the winter production campaign is flourishing.

    The masses in this province have traditionally used heated kang beds or stoves for heating in the winter. However, in many places, earthen kang beds were dismantled and used as base fertilizer for wheat; some wooden beds were also converted into simple wooden tracks; and some of the earth bricks prepared for building kang beds were used to build earthen blast furnaces. At the same time, due to the intensity of production, many commune members had not yet fully prepared their cotton clothes, quilts, and cotton shoes. Therefore, after the start of winter, heating became a major concern for the broad masses. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee has repeatedly emphasized through meetings and directives that the First Secretaries of the Party committees should personally take action and treat winter heating as an important task to be resolved urgently. Various localities encountered some difficulties in resolving this problem, such as insufficient firewood and grass, a shortage of kang bricks, etc., and some cadres therefore developed a fear of difficulty. However, the experience of many areas has proven that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, the secretaries take action, and the masses are fully mobilized, all difficulties can be overcome. Currently, the Party Secretaries of most counties in the Liaocheng Special Zone and in Jining, Linyi, Heze, Changwei, and other areas have generally conducted in-depth visits, convened forums and debates, and mobilized the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, and everyone has worked together. As a result, they have found various solutions and basically achieved warm beds for every household, firewood for every family, and cotton clothing for everyone. These methods include: First, organizing the broad masses of commune members to gather grass and firewood, and sweep up leaves. In Pingyuan County, the labor force implemented a system of bringing baskets to the fields to collect weeds and broken firewood, with the entire county collecting three million catties in a single day. The homes for the elderly and kindergartens in the Garden Village of the Third Battalion of the Red Flag Commune in this county have already collected 15,000 catties of broken grass, and they are now sleeping on warm heated kang beds. The Liaocheng Special Zone has collected over 100 million catties of leaves alone. Second, organizing special brick-making teams to help commune members build kang beds or repair old ones. The Qunxing Commune in Ju County has built new kang beds and repaired over 7,000 old ones. The Aiguo Commune has solved the problem of sleeping kang beds for commune members by dismantling old walls and making earth bricks. Third, combining public canteens, various sideline occupations, and iron smelting to solve the heating problem for commune members. In the Haosheng Commune of Zouping County, more than 4,000 households have set up small stoves to heat the kang beds and smoke fertilizer. The Aiguo Commune in Ju County distributes the feed for more than 10,000 pigs to commune members' homes for warm cooking, and provides the flour mills to commune members for heating. In the Jining area, large heated kang beds have been built in the canteens, and the problem of commune members eating and warming up has also been solved. Fourth, adopting various methods to solve the difficulty of lacking firewood and coal. Many places are making artificial coal to replace good coal for heating stoves. The Dongjiao Commune in Licheng County uses a mixture of ninety catties of bay mud, one catty of salt, and ten catties of wheat bran to make coal balls, which are as good as coal and can completely solve the heating problem. The counties in the Liaocheng Special Zone are rushing to make large batches of magnetic hot water bottles, and some places have dug semi-underground, semi-open-air greenhouses, which can solve many problems. Fifth, in the distribution of resources, each commune carefully calculates and distributes the surplus firewood and grass to the masses for heating. Sixth, vigorously solving the problem of cotton clothing for commune members. The method is to generally not allow women to go to the fields at night, freeing up their strength to do some needlework. At the same time, a large number of sewing machines are concentrated to process and rush to make cotton clothes and quilts for the masses day and night. Pingyuan County, in a half-month blitz, has rushed to make 150,000 sets of new cotton clothes for the masses. In the counties of the Liaocheng Special Zone, an average of one set of cotton clothes and cotton shoes has been made for each person. Communes provide cotton wadding and cotton cloth to needy households, the elderly, the sick, and those with many children, and provide them with care.

    After relying on the strength of the masses to solve the winter problems in many ways, the labor efficiency of the masses has significantly improved. In many counties in the Liaocheng Special Zone, the winter-fallow land has been plowed, and the wheat has generally been watered once and fertilized once.

    多方面解决冬季取暖问题
    山东群众拾柴草砌新炕制棉衣准备过冬忙
    本报讯  山东省各级党组织根据省委指示，在安排社员生活中，第一书记亲自动手，发动群众，想出多种办法，解决了农民冬季取暖问题。现在部分地区已经使所有的敬老院、托儿所、产妇院和社员各户可以暖暖和和的度过寒冬了。广大群众在解决了这个问题以后，干劲倍增，冬季生产运动益形高涨。
    这个省的群众，冬天历来有睡热炕或利用火炉取暖的习惯。但是很多地方拆去了土炕，作为小麦底肥；有些木床也改作了简易木轨道；准备垒炕的土坯，一部分又用去修建土高炉。同时，由于生产紧张，很多社员的棉衣棉被棉鞋还未全准备好。因此，入冬以后，取暖已成为广大群众很关心的问题。中共山东省委曾多次通过会议和下达指示，强调党委第一书记亲自动手，把冬季取暖当成一项重要工作突击解决。各地在解决这个问题时，都曾遇到过一些困难，如柴草不足，缺少炕坯等等，有些干部也因此产生过畏难情绪。但是许多地区的经验证明，只要领导重视，书记动手，充分发动群众，一切困难都是可以解决的。现在聊城专区的大部分县和济宁、临沂、菏泽、昌潍等地区的党委书记，普遍深入访问，召开座谈会、辩论会，发动群众献策献计，大家一齐动手。结果找出了多种解决办法，基本上达到了户户有暖铺、家家有柴烧、人人有棉衣。这些办法：一是组织广大社员拾草拾柴，打扫树叶。平原县的劳动大军实行下地带筐子，回来带杂草碎柴，全县一天就拾三百万斤。这县红旗公社第三营花园村的敬老院、幼儿园已拾到一万五千斤碎草，现在他们已经睡上暖和的热炕。聊城专区光树叶拾到一亿多斤。二是组织专门制坯队，帮助社员垒炕或修理旧炕。莒县群星公社已垒新炕和修旧炕七千多盘。爱国公社用拆旧墙和打土坯办法，解决社员的睡炕问题。三是结合公共食堂、各种副业及炼铁等解决社员的取暖问题。邹平县好生公社四千多户，每户设立小炉，既烧热炕又能熏肥。莒县爱国公社将一万多头猪的饲料，分到社员家中温煮，把制粉房交给社员借以取暖。济宁地区的食堂里，修起大火炕，社员吃饭取暖问题也得到解决。四是采用多种办法解决缺柴缺煤的困难。很多地方正在制人造煤代替好煤生火炉。历城县东郊公社用九十斤湾泥、一斤盐、十斤麦糠混合制成煤球，顶好煤用，可以全部解决取暖问题。聊城专区各县赶制大批磁汤壶，还有些地方挖了半阴半阳的地下温室，这些都能解决不少问题。五是各公社在分配中，精打细算，将多余的柴草，分给群众取暖。六是大力解决社员的棉衣问题。办法是晚上一般不让妇女下地，腾出力量做些针线。同时还集中大批缝纫机，昼夜为群众加工赶制棉衣、棉被。平原县突击半月已为群众赶做了十五万套新棉衣。聊城专区各县，平均每人已做起一套棉衣、棉鞋。有些困难户、老人、病人、多子女者，公社都给予棉絮、棉布，加以照顾。
    依靠群众力量从多方面来解决过冬问题之后，群众劳动效率显著提高。聊城专区很多县的冬闲地已经翻完，小麦已普遍浇了一遍水，追了一次肥。      （胡雷）（附图片）
