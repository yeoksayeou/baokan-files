Great Inspiration, Warm Concern
	Our Shanghai Correspondent

	The news of Premier Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people, visiting Shanghai caused a sensation throughout Shanghai. Workers at two small Shanghai factories—the Construction Machinery Factory and the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory—were also joyfully discussing it: "Wouldn't it be wonderful if Premier Kim Il-sung could visit our factory!" Some people said: "The Premier is so busy, he probably won't have time to visit a small factory like ours."

	But on the second day of his arrival in Shanghai (December 4th), Premier Kim Il-sung actually came to the Construction Machinery Factory and the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory.

	The Construction Machinery Factory, with only 250 employees and very simple equipment, has been actively carrying out technical innovations, building indigenous equipment, and undertaking the task of manufacturing large machinery. All of this greatly interested the leader of our great neighbor.

	Accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Mayor Xu Jianguo, and other comrades, the Premier and the Korean guests were immediately welcomed by the workers upon entering the factory gate. Stepping into the courtyard, they saw several small, indigenous machine tools in the open-air yard processing a batch of large converter tilting machine parts. In recent months, the factory's workers have used scrap materials to manufacture and modify more than twenty simple indigenous machine tools, spending only more than 27,000 yuan in total, saving the state 600,000 yuan in funds and a large amount of manpower. In recent months, they have produced twenty-four sets of large parts for steelmaking converters for the state. The Premier listened with great interest to the introduction by Wang Genhai, the factory's Party branch secretary, and stepped onto the platform of a shaper, bending down to carefully observe how this indigenous machine tool was processing the workpiece, which was several times larger than the machine body.

	"How heavy are these workpieces?" the Premier asked, pointing to the converter tilting machine air cowl being processed on an indigenous machine tool.

	"Each one currently being processed weighs eight tons," replied branch secretary Wang Genhai. "The largest batch weighs eleven and a half tons each, and they have already been installed on the new converter at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which began producing steel on August 1st."

	Kim Il-sung said: "Ants gnawing at a bone, this method is very good." He turned to Comrade Park Jung-ae and said, "Look, how simple this is! As long as you are creative, you can do anything."

	The Premier walked to a huge air cowl and watched how the workers were using a combination of foreign and indigenous methods, using both a drill press and electric drills to simultaneously drill holes in it. The Premier asked: "How are such large parts moved?"

	Wang Genhai said: "We don't have large lifting equipment, so we first dig a pit next to the large part, and then use jacks to lift it."

	Vice Premier Chen Yi said with a smile: "This is also an indigenous method, a poor method."

	The Premier also smiled: "But it can solve the problem! If you don't have large equipment, you think of your own ways, this is the revolutionary method."

	The Construction Machinery Factory was formed by merging five small ship repair factories. Last year's total output value was only 776,000 yuan, and this year's target is 5.82 million, but the workers are determined to complete 7.8 million. The Premier was very happy to hear this and said that this is a ten-fold increase! Branch Secretary Wang Genhai said: We plan to increase the total output value to 17 million next year.

	Comrade Chen Yi said to the workers of the Construction Machinery Factory with a smile: The Premier supports you, so work hard!

	All the workers of the Construction Machinery Factory regarded the care and encouragement of Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests as supreme glory, and they presented the Premier with photos of all the indigenous machine tools and simple equipment in their factory as a souvenir. The Premier said to them: Thank you, we have seen a lot of things here. Think boldly, do boldly. The Chinese Party's policy is completely correct.

	The guests' cars passed through narrow alleyways and came to a simple lane factory in the western district of Shanghai. Here, you cannot see towering chimneys or tall factory buildings. There are only 100 workers here, but they are producing seamless steel tubes, which are considered to be cutting-edge products. This is the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory.

	Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests first came to the office upstairs. This is actually a small wooden room of only a few meters square, which is the factory's only room that serves as a dining hall, auditorium, and living room.

	Branch Secretary Zhao Xixiang told the distinguished guests that the factory encountered many difficulties when it started producing seamless steel tubes at the beginning of this year. The main problem was that the mandrel of the piercing mill was prone to deformation or melting at high temperatures, resulting in very low production efficiency, with only about one ton produced per day. The factory had consulted with engineers from Anshan Iron and Steel, professors from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and many experts, but after they came to the factory and saw the situation, they all shook their heads and left, saying that there was no way to solve the problem and that it was impossible to produce seamless steel tubes with such machines. In the end, the factory mobilized all the workers to come up with solutions, and the veteran worker Pan Ayao improved the mandrel of the piercing mill. Now, the factory's daily output has risen to sixty tons.

	The Premier expressed his surprise upon hearing this and immediately asked: What is your production plan for this year? How much can you achieve? How many workers do you have, and how many veteran workers? The branch secretary replied: The production plan for this year is 9,000 tons, and now we can achieve 15,000 to 20,000 tons. When the Premier heard the branch secretary say that among the factory's 100 workers, there were only a few skilled veteran workers, and many were new workers who had been transferred from barbers, tailors, and small vendors, and that the factory did not have a single engineer or college student, he smiled happily. The Premier said in fluent Chinese: "Don't you have Pan Ayao? He is better than an engineer, even better than a college student."

	"From one ton to sixty tons per day, an increase of sixty times, can it be increased further?" the Premier asked with concern.

	"Yes. The workers heard that the Premier was coming to visit and are determined to increase the output to more than seventy tons," the branch secretary replied excitedly.

	"That's great. If we can be of such great help to you, we'll come here often," the Premier's humorous words made everyone laugh heartily.

	"The seamless steel tube factory under construction in Korea is designed according to your factory. The machines have been installed, but the workers are not yet so skilled," the Premier said to the branch secretary.

	"The factory has already selected two skilled workers who are preparing to go to Korea."

	"Very good," the Premier said happily.

	Premier Kim Il-sung came to the workshop and immediately went to the piercing mill. The workers immediately cheered, and their production enthusiasm was even higher. Red-hot steel tubes were spit out from the machine one after another. The Premier's interest in the visit was so strong, and he watched so carefully, looking at it again and again. The branch secretary pointed to a worker covered in oil and told the Premier: "He is Pan Ayao." The Premier immediately shook Pan Ayao's hand tightly and said: "You are working very well, it is good for your country, and it is also good for our country!" Pan Ayao, who had always buried himself in his work and was not good at talking, was so excited that he could not speak for a long time while holding the Premier's hand. Premier Kim Il-sung inquired in detail about Pan Ayao's improvement of the piercing mill.

	The Premier and the distinguished guests visited this small factory for nearly an hour. After the Premier left, the factory boiled again, and the workers immediately held a discussion meeting to discuss further increasing production, carrying out technical revolution, and responding to the care of Premier Kim Il-sung and the distinguished guests.

    巨大的鼓舞  热情的关怀
    本报驻上海记者
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成首相来到上海访问的消息，轰动了整个上海。上海两家小工厂——建设机器厂和永鑫无缝钢管厂的工人们也喜气洋洋地议论开了：“要是金日成首相能到我们工厂来参观参观多好啊！”有的人说：“首相那么忙，不会有空来参观我们这样的小厂吧。”
    哪知金日成首相在到达上海的第二天（4日），真的来到了建设机器厂和永鑫无缝钢管厂。
    只有二百五十名职工、设备十分简陋的建设机器厂，大闹技术革新，大造土设备，积极担负起制造大型机械的任务。这一切使我们伟大邻邦的领袖感到很大的兴趣。
    首相和朝鲜贵宾们由陈毅副总理、许建国副市长等陪同，一进厂门立刻受到职工们的欢迎。走进院子，只见露天场地上几台小小的土机床正在加工生产一批庞大的转炉倾动机部件。最近几个月中，这个厂的工人们用废旧料自己制造和改装了二十多台简易的土机床，一共只花了二万七千多元。为国家节约了六十万元的资金和大批人力。几个月来他们已为国家生产出二十四套炼钢转炉的大型部件。首相一面很感兴趣地倾听工厂支部书记王根海的介绍，一面跨上一部牛头刨床的平台，弯下腰去仔细观察这部土机床怎样在那比车身还大好几倍的工作物上加工的情况。
    “这些工作物有多重？”首相指着正在土机床上加工的转炉倾动机风啳问道。
    “现在正在加工的每个有八吨重。”支部书记王根海回答说，“最大的一批每个重十一吨半，已经做好安装在上钢一厂的新转炉上，8月1日就开始出钢了。”
    金日成首相说：“蚂蚁啃骨头，这办法很好。”他转身对朴正爱同志说：“你看，这样做多简单呀！只要有创造性，什么都能办到。”
    首相走到一个巨大的风啳旁边，看工人们怎样以洋土结合的办法用搬钻和电钻同时在它上面钻眼子。首相问：“这么大的部件怎样搬动的？”
    王根海说：“我们没有大型起重设备，就在大部件旁边先掘一个坑，再用千斤顶来顶。”
    陈毅副总理笑着说：“这也是土办法、穷办法。”
    首相也笑了：“可是能解决问题！没有大设备，自己想办法，这就是革命的办法。”
    建设机器厂是五家修理小船的小工厂合并起来的，去年总产值只有七十七万六千元，今年的指标是五百八十二万，可是工人们一定要完成七百八十万。首相听到这个情况，非常高兴地说，这是翻十倍呀！支部书记王根海说：我们打算明年总产值要增加到一千七百万。
    陈毅同志笑着对建设机器厂的职工们说：首相支持你们，你们踏踏实实地干吧！
    建设机器厂的全体职工把金日成首相和贵宾们的关怀和鼓励，当作无尚的光荣，他们把自己厂的全部土机床和简易设备的照片送给首相留念。首相对他们说：谢谢你们，我们在这里看到很多东西。大胆地想，大胆地干吧。中国党的方针是完全正确的。
    贵宾们的汽车穿过一条条狭窄的里弄来到了上海西区一座简陋的弄堂小厂，这里看不到高耸入云的烟囱，也看不到高大的厂房，这里只有一百名工人，但是却生产着被人们认为是尖端产品的无缝钢管。这就是永鑫无缝钢管厂。
    金日成首相和贵宾们首先来到办公室楼上。这实际是一间只有几公尺见方的小木板房，它是厂里唯一的一间既做饭厅、礼堂，又兼做客厅的房间。
    支部书记赵熙祥告诉贵宾们，这个厂今年初生产无缝钢管的时候，遇到很多困难。主要是穿孔机的顶头在高温下容易变形或是熔化，生产效率很低，每天只能生产一吨左右。厂里曾经先后请教过鞍钢的工程师、北京钢铁学院的教授和好些专家们，他们到厂里来看了以后都摇摇头走了，说是没有办法，并且认为用这样的机器，不可能生产出无缝钢管。最后还是发动厂内全体职工想办法，老工人潘阿耀改进了穿孔机顶头。现在，全厂一天的产量已经上升到六十吨。
    首相听了表示很惊奇，立即问：你们今年的生产计划多少？可以达到多少？共有多少工人、有多少老工人？支部书记回答说：今年生产计划是九千吨，现在我们可以达到一万五千吨到两万吨。当首相听支部书记说，厂里一百名工人中，只有几个熟练的老工人，有很多是从理发师、裁缝、小摊贩等转业来的新工人，并且全厂没有一个工程师和大学生时，很高兴地笑了。首相用相当熟练的中国话说：“你们不是有个潘阿耀吗？他比工程师还好，比大学生还行。”
    “从一天产一吨到六十吨，提高了六十倍，还能再提高吗？”首相关切地问。
    “能。工人们听说首相来参观，决心把产量再提高到七十吨以上。”支部书记兴奋地回答。
    “那太好了，能对你们有这样大的帮助的话，我们经常要来了。”首相的这些幽默的话，逗得所有的人都畅怀大笑起来。
    “朝鲜正在建设的无缝钢管厂，就是按照你们的厂设计，机器已经安装好了，只是工人操作还不那么熟练。”首相对支部书记说。
    “厂里已经抽出两名熟练工人，正准备去朝鲜。”
    “很好。”首相高兴地说。
    金日成首相来到车间，立即去到穿孔机面前，工人们马上欢呼起来，生产情绪更加高涨，火红的钢管一根连一根的从机器上吐出来。首相参观的情趣是那样浓，观看得那样仔细，看了一遍又一遍。支部书记指着一个满身油污的工人告诉首相：“他就是潘阿耀。”首相马上紧紧的握着潘阿耀的手说：“你工作得很好，对你们国家有好处，对我们国家也有好处！”向来埋头工作、不善言谈的潘阿耀握着首相的手激动得半晌说不出话来。金日成首相详细的询问了潘阿耀改进穿孔机的经过。
    首相和贵宾们在这个小小的工厂里，参观了将近一个小时。首相离去以后，厂里又沸腾起来，工人们立即举行了座谈会，商量进一步提高产量，大搞技术革命，来回答金日成首相和贵宾们的关怀。（附图片）
