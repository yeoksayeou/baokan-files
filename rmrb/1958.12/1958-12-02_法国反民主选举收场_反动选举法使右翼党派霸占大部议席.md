Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 1st: Yesterday, the second round of voting for the French National Assembly elections took place in mainland France. As expected, right-wing parties, aided by a reactionary election law, seized the vast majority of seats in the National Assembly.

Of the 465 constituencies in mainland France, only 39 elected deputies (one per constituency) in the first round of voting held on November 23. The remaining 426 constituencies required a second round of voting because no candidate had obtained the absolute majority of votes required for election. In this round, candidates only needed to obtain a relative majority to be elected.

After the second round of voting, the French Ministry of the Interior announced the results of the allocation of all seats in the National Assembly. These results fully demonstrate the undemocratic nature of this election. The French Communist Party, which obtained 3,882,204 votes (18.9% of the total) in the first round and 3,741,384 votes (20.76% of the total) in the second round, only won ten seats. However, the right-wing "Independent Party," which received 1,067,000 fewer votes than the Communist Party in the first round and only 50,080 more votes than the Communist Party in the second round, obtained 120 seats. The Popular Republican Movement, which received over 1,808,000 votes and over 1,365,000 votes in the two rounds respectively, also obtained 44 seats. The Socialist Party obtained over 3,167,000 votes and over 2,488,000 votes, winning 40 seats. The Radical Socialist Party won 13 seats.

The party of Soustelle, de Gaulle's right-hand man and political leader of the Algerian military rebellion group – the "Union for the New Republic" – received 278,000 fewer votes than the Communist Party in the first round, but obtained 4,769,052 votes in the second round. It seized 188 seats.

The remaining seats were held by various small parties.

Seeing that the National Assembly under de Gaulle's "constitution" is in reality nothing more than a decoration for a dictatorial regime, and knowing that the seats had long been pre-divided by the colluding right-wing parties, French voters showed indifference to the election from the beginning of the campaign. In the first round of voting, the number of people who abstained increased from 15% of the total number of voters during the "referendum" on de Gaulle's "constitution" in September to 22.9%, and in the second round it increased to 25.21%.

In the second round of voting, French right-wing parties colluded with each other to exclude French Communist Party candidates and republicans who opposed de Gaulle's dictatorial regime. The right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, led by Mollet, played a shameful role in this dirty collusion.

During the election, fascists were rampant in their activities to oppose the French Communist Party. For example, on the day of voting yesterday, fascist bandits attacked the Communist Party local organizations and newspaper offices in the 13th arrondissement of Paris and Roanne in eastern France.

Despite this, the French Communist Party still proved that it remains a powerful force by gaining the support of approximately one-quarter of French voters.

### 法国反民主选举收场  反动选举法使右翼党派霸占大部议席

    法国反民主选举收场
    反动选举法使右翼党派霸占大部议席
    据新华社1日讯  巴黎消息：昨天法国本土举行了国民议会选举第二轮投票。不出所料，右翼党派依靠反动的选举法的帮助，霸占了国民议会中绝大部分的议席。
    法国本土四百六十五个选区中，在11月23日举行的第一轮投票中只有三十九个选区选出了议员（每选区一人），其余四百二十六个选区都因为没有人获得当选必需的绝对多数票而需要举行第二轮投票，这次候选人只要获得相对多数就能当选。
    在第二轮投票结束后，法国内政部宣布了国民议会全部议席分配的结果。这个结果充分说明了这次选举的不民主性质。在第一轮投票中获得三百八十八万二千二百零四票（占总票数18.9％）和在第二轮投票中获得三百七十四万一千三百八十四票（占总票数20.76％）的法国共产党，只获得了十个议席。而在第一轮投票中比共产党少得一百零六万七千多票、在第二轮投票中只比共产党多得五万零八千多票的右翼政党“独立党”，却得到一百二十个议席。人民共和党在两轮选举中分别得到一百八十万八千多票和一百三十六万五千多票，也得到了四十四个议席。社会党得到三百一十六万七千多票和二百四十八万八千多票，得到四十席。激进社会党得十三席。
    戴高乐的左右手、阿尔及利亚军事叛乱集团的政治领袖苏斯戴尔的党——“保卫新共和联盟”在第一轮投票中比共产党少得二十七万八千多票，在第二轮投票中得到四百七十六万九千零五十二票。它霸占了一百八十八个议席。
    其余议席由各小党派所有。
    由于看到在戴高乐“宪法”下的国民议会实际上只不过是独裁政权的装饰品，并且知道议席早已经被互相勾结的各右翼政党事先瓜分好，法国选民从竞选运动开始起就对这次选举表示冷淡。在第一轮投票中，弃权的人已经从9月间就戴高乐“宪法”举行“公民投票”时占选民总数的15％增加到22.9％，而在第二轮投票中则增加到25.21％。
    法国右翼党派在第二轮投票中互相勾结，来排斥法国共产党候选人和反对戴高乐独裁政权的共和人士。在上述肮脏的勾当中以摩勒为首的社会党右翼领袖扮演了可耻的角色。
    在选举中，法西斯分子猖狂活动，来反对法国共产党。例如在昨天投票的日子，法西斯匪徒就袭击了巴黎第十三选区和东部罗安的共产党地方组织和报社。
    尽管如此，法国共产党仍然以获得约四分之一的法国选民的支持而证明它仍然是一支强大的力量。
