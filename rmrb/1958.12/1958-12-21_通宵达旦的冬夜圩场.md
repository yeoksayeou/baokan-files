The All-Night Winter Market
　　Deng Guoxiang
　　
In the past, whenever night fell, the streets of several market towns in the Yuwan People's Commune in Wengyuan County would become very quiet. Especially on winter nights, it was exceptionally silent; the crisp sound of a pedestrian passing by would only elicit a few barks from the dogs…

　　However, on the night of the commune's first wage distribution – November 29th – the market town was unusually lively. The stalls set up by the commune's supply and marketing cooperative in six market towns, including Shitoutou, Yuwan, Taiping, Baisha, Baodong, and Bazai, were crowded with commune members all night long. Under the bright light of kerosene lamps, heads surged, shadows flickered, and the noise was deafening. Some darted from stall to stall, and then back again, repeatedly selecting and comparing various goods; others, even after buying enough supplies, still wandered around the bustling market, reluctant to leave. Late into the night, the crescent moon had long risen in the east, casting a silvery glow on the fields and roads. As batches of people left the market entrance, they were constantly met by groups of people flocking into the market. Many commune members, already "fully loaded," would encounter acquaintances on the way, and to act as "consultants" and offer advice, they would enthusiastically return to the market. The business of this market continued until 5 pm on the 30th. In the words of the commune members, such a lively and jubilant scene was "unprecedented."

　　On that evening, before the market opened, commune members from various production areas of the commune beat gongs and drums, and held celebration rallies in various market towns to celebrate the distribution of the first wages. Many commune members expressed their feelings at the meeting. They said that this wage distribution was another great event after the commune implemented free meals. Everyone recalled that a year ago, grain production had not yet passed the test, and coupled with its mountainous location, the original standard of living was relatively low. Although production increased every year in the past, they mainly ate porridge and sweet potatoes, and only ate dry rice during the busy farming season. However, after a year of hard work this year, they achieved a bumper harvest of grain, with the yield of late rice alone reaching 1,560 jin per mu, an increase of more than threefold. This provided the material conditions for the commune to implement a half-wage, half-supply distribution system. When the commune announced in early November that meals were free and that everyone could eat their fill of dry rice three times a day, the commune members cheered like thunder. Now, each laborer receives an average of five yuan per month in wages, how can the commune members not be excited?

　　After the celebration rally, the commune members flocked to the stalls. Since the commune was taking care of the food problem, the most crowded stalls were the general merchandise stalls. Items like toothbrushes, batteries, soap, scarves, thermos bottles, fabrics, shoes, and socks became popular commodities. Poor peasant commune member Pan Qihuan walked back and forth with his two children, holding the wages he had received, unsure of what to buy. He was simply too excited, never imagining that he would have cash to spend this year. Originally, he was an overdrawn household with three children, one in school and two who needed care, which meant his wife could not work regularly. With more mouths to feed and fewer people working, his annual labor income, after receiving enough rations, would be overdrawn by more than 40 yuan, and he could never escape poverty. Now, his children are studying and attending nurseries for free, and free meals have forever removed his overdrawn status. Who knew he would receive money today! So, he often says to people, "A thousand words are not enough to describe how good the commune is. The commune has completely turned me around!" That day, when he made two sets of floral clothes for his children, he instructed them, "These were made for you to wear by the commune. The commune is raising you. Be good and listen to the aunts in the nursery, understand?" His children, seeing the floral clothes, grinned, their eyes shining with boundless happiness!

　　The salespersons were extremely busy, unable to handle the influx of customers, especially the women, who were most meticulous in choosing goods. Female commune member Chen Yin wanted a clip-on cloth jacket one moment, and a thermal undershirt the next, unsure which one was better. She cherished this wage very much – the first time she had full control over the fruits of her labor. Originally, she was a child bride, and had never had any money in her hands in her family. Furthermore, the agricultural cooperative's distribution was still based on the household, with the money going to the head of the family. Thus, her husband controlled the entire family's income and expenses. She had to ask her husband for money to buy anything, so unless it was something she absolutely had to buy, she wouldn't easily ask her husband. For example, the bamboo hat she wore was already tattered, but she never managed to buy a new one. Now that the wages were distributed to each individual, she could freely use her own money. This time, after receiving her wages, she first bought a new bamboo hat, then carefully selected a thermal undershirt at the general merchandise stall, and deposited the remaining three yuan in the bank for easy access.

　　At one stall, cadre Shen Shujie was selecting goods when he caught sight of female commune member Shen Xiao squeezing in. He smiled and said, "Shen Xiao, where's the wage you received? Hurry up and give it to me!" Shen Xiao was initially stunned, then smiled embarrassedly and replied, "The hell I will! I already believe it!" Some commune members who knew the inside story burst out laughing. It turned out that when debating the superiority of the commune, Shen Xiao did not believe that there would be wages to receive in the future, so she bet with Shen Shujie, "If the commune distributes wages, I don't want it, I'll give it all to you!" Who would have thought that soon after, the commune announced the great news of free meals? The commune could achieve such an unprecedented thing, let alone distribute wages? Shen Xiao believed it. She believed not only in wage distribution, but also in the entire superiority of the commune. She became more active in production, waking her husband up at 4 am every morning to go to work. She couldn't help but sing a mountain song: "The rooster crows at dawn, softly waking my love; The children are sent to the nursery. Husband and wife go to the fields."

　　The salespersons in each market town, after working day and night, still had to settle accounts after the market closed, some counting banknotes, others organizing invoices. Supply and Marketing Cooperative Director Mao Debao punched the numbers reported by each market town into the abacus, and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Oh! Breaking records, breaking records! The total turnover is 309,449 yuan!" (Attached picture)

    通宵达旦的冬夜圩场
    邓国庠
    往常，每当夜幕低垂，翁源县鱼湾人民公社几个圩市的街道就已经很清静了。尤其是冬夜，更是静寂异常，偶有行人路过的清脆脚步声，就会招引出几声家犬的吠声……
    但是，在公社第一次发放工资的那个晚上——11月29日，圩市却是热闹非常，公社供销部在石双头、鱼湾、太平、白沙、宝洞、坝仔等六个圩市摆设的货摊，整晚都被社员们围得密密的，在煤汽灯的亮光下，人头钻涌，人影晃动，闹闹嚷嚷。有的从这摊窜到那摊，又从那摊折回这摊，反复挑选、比较各色货物；有的虽然买足了用品，仍然在闹市内踱来踱去，留连忘返。夜深了，弯弯的下弦月，早就从东方升起，给田庄、道路洒下一片银水，眼看一批批人离开圩口了，可是，圩市的热闹景况仍未见减弱。出圩的人迎面不断遇到一群群人陆续流进圩市去，有不少本已是“满载而归”的社员，就是这样半路遇到了熟人，为充当别人的“参谋”，出主意，又兴致勃勃地折回圩里来。这一圩市的营业，一直到30日下午5时才结束。这样热闹、狂欢的景况，用社员的话说：“是前所未有。”
    这天晚上，在开市之前，公社各生产区的社员都敲锣打鼓，分别在各圩举行了庆祝大会，庆祝发放第一次工资，许多社员都在会上发表了感想。他们说，这次发工资，是公社实行吃饭不要钱后的又一件大喜事。大家回忆起一年之前，粮食生产还未过关，加上这里地处山区，原来的生活水平是较低的，虽然过去年年增产，但还是以吃稀饭和番薯为主，只在农忙期间是吃干饭。可是，今年苦战一年，获得了粮食特大丰收，单以晚稻来说，亩产量就达到一千五百六十斤，增产了三倍多，这就使公社实行半工资半供给的分配制度具备了物质条件。当11月初，公社一宣布吃饭不要钱，一日三餐干饭放开肚子吃到饱时，社员们都欢呼雷动，现在平均每个劳动力每月又领到五元工资，怎能叫社员不兴奋呢？
    庆祝大会结束后，社员们都拥到货摊前去，吃的问题，公社都包起来了，所以最拥挤的是百货摊，像牙刷、电池、肥皂、颈巾、热水瓶、布匹、鞋袜等，成了大家争买的商品。贫农社员潘启环拿着领到的工资，两手带着两个孩子走来走去，一时没了主意，不知买什么好，他实在太兴奋了，万万想不到今年有现钱花用。原来他是个超支户，有三个孩子，一个读书，两个还需要照顾，累得他的妻子不能经常出勤。吃的人多，做的人少，一年劳动所得，领足口粮后，就要超支四十多元了，一直摆脱不了贫困。现在孩子都免费读书、入托儿所，而吃饭不要钱，又永远使他脱掉了超支帽子，谁知道今天还有钱领呢！所以他时常对人说：“一千句也是公社好，公社使我彻底翻身了！”这天，当他给自己的孩子做两套花衣服时，就叮嘱他的孩子说：“这是公社做给你们穿的，公社养大你们，在托儿所里要乖乖听阿姨话，知道吗？”他的孩子见了花衣服，就嘻开了小嘴巴，眼睛闪出无限幸福的光芒！
    售货员忙得不可开交，应接不暇，特别是妇女们，选货是最细致的。女社员陈银，一会想要夹布衣，一会又想要卫生衣，不知道哪件好。她很珍重地使用这笔工资——第一次全权使用自己的劳动所得。原来，她从前是个童养媳，在家庭中历来是无钱过手的，而农业社的分配，仍然是以户为单位，分到家长手里去，这样，丈夫也就掌握了全家的收支大权，买什么东西都要向丈夫要钱，所以，要不是非买不可的东西，都不轻易向丈夫开口，有时想买些头绳之类的什么的，都很不方便。比如自己戴的竹帽早就破烂了，但始终未买成。现在，工资发到每个人手里了，可以随意使用自己的钱，这次发了工资，她首先就买了顶新竹帽，然后细心地在百货摊上，挑选了一件卫生衣，并把余下的三元，储蓄到银行去，随用随取。
    在一个货摊上，社干部沈书捷正在选货，一眼瞅到女社员沈萧钻进来，便笑着说：“沈萧，你领到的工资呢？快拿来给我吧！”沈萧初听愕然，随后就不好意思地笑着回答他：“鬼才给你，我早已相信啦！”一些知道底细的社员便哄然笑起来。原来沈萧在辩论公社优越性时，不相信将来有工资领，就和沈书捷打赌说：“如果公社发工资，我不要，全给你！”谁料不久，公社宣布了实行吃饭不要钱的大喜事，像这样一件千古未闻的事，公社也能办到，何况发工资呢？沈萧相信了。她相信的不单是发工资，而且是公社的全部优越性，她生产也积极起来了，每天早晨四时就叫丈夫起床出工，她还情不自禁地唱起山歌来：“五更鸡啼天渐光，细声细气拍醒郎；孩子送进托儿所。夫妻两人出田庄。”
    各圩场的售货员，经过夜以继日的忙碌，在散市之后，还要进行结账，有的点数银纸，有的整理发票。供销部主任毛德保把各圩汇报的数字，在算盘上敲打了一翻，不禁惊喜地叫起来：“噢！破纪录，破纪录，营业总额三十万九千四百四十九元整。”（附图片）
