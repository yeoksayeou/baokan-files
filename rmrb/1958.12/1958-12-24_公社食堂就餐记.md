    A Visit to the People's Commune Dining Hall
    Wu Pei
    We had some business to attend to in Liulitun, which belongs to the Yongfeng People's Commune. After finishing our work, the sun was already setting. We were afraid it would be too late to return to the city for dinner, so we decided to eat in the village. Thus, the production team leader took us to a nearby public dining hall.
    Upon entering, we were greeted by a mural on the wall. The painting wasn't of particularly high quality, but it had a lot of spirit. It depicted mountains and rivers, trees and fields, crops, houses, and people. The colors were bright and vibrant. In addition, a rising sun between two peaks illuminated everything, making it appear exceptionally radiant. In the upper left corner of the painting, there was also a poem inscribed, the first two lines of which read: "The people's commune has a beautiful landscape, with green hills surrounding the village."
    The dining hall was an ordinary courtyard house, with three large dining rooms and a smaller reception room. Each dining room was bright and clean, with the walls painted snow-white. Posters, paper-cut paintings, and couplets were hung around the room. Bowls and chopsticks were neatly arranged on the tables, spotless, with the names of the diners written next to them. The reception room was even more exquisitely decorated, with a large round table and four small square tables, covered with snow-white tablecloths, teapots and teacups. Five-colored paper balls hung from the ceiling. The large dining rooms were where the commune members ate, accommodating about two hundred people at a time. The reception room was used for commune members to entertain guests.
    The team leader led us into the reception room, poured tea, and said, "Although this is the reception room, the food is actually the same as what the commune members eat, unless you'd like to order something extra." We quickly asked him not to add any extra dishes and said we'd like to eat the same as the commune members. Seeing our firm resolve, the team leader readily agreed.
    It wasn't yet time for dinner, and a cook came in to greet us. He was wearing a white work uniform and a white work hat. When he spoke, he took off his mask, revealing a fair face. He looked to be in his thirties and gave off a clean and efficient impression. One of our companions said, "You've really done a great job with this dining hall. It must be one of the best in the village!" The cook wasn't much of a talker and honestly replied:
  "There are thirteen such dining halls in the village, and they're all about the same. We're just average; we're not doing a great job. Please give us some feedback after you eat!" We asked him to sit down and talk about the dining hall's work.
    There were five cooks in total at this dining hall, and he was the team leader. They all used to work in the fields. In August, when the dining hall was established, they were selected by the masses to be cooks. They didn't have any strong feelings about whether they wanted to do it or not, but they were just afraid of not cooking well, because they weren't experts. However, they learned from each other with the other dining hall cooks, and they always sought feedback from the diners after each meal. Now, they not only cook delicious meals, but they also make sure that no two meals are the same. They make the food for the elderly, children, sick people, and pregnant women extra soft and tasty. Among the five of them, one is a woman, and the four men take care of her, not letting her carry water or do heavy work. The water used to be drawn from a nearby well, but they later discovered that the well water was a bit salty and didn't taste good, so they went to a well far away to fetch it, carrying about eighty loads a day. The four men take turns working at night, preparing hot food for those who work late or return from the city. One of our companions clicked his tongue and said:
  "Isn't that too tiring?" He still honestly replied: "Oh, what's tiring? Seeing the commune members treat the dining hall like their own home and come back for meals in the middle of the night really makes us happy!"
    As dinnertime approached, he busied himself with preparations. After a while, the sound of bugles rang out in the village. A little later, the commune members came to the dining hall in twos and threes, chatting and laughing. They washed their hands at the "washing station," got their food from the kitchen, and sat down at their respective places to eat. This meal consisted of coarsely ground grains prepared with care: red bean rice cakes, pickled cabbage soup, and prickly ash-flavored pickles. Needless to say, the commune members who had returned from work ate with gusto, and we city dwellers also enjoyed the meal very much. One commune member said to us, "The food at the dining hall is really good, even better than what middle peasants used to eat. Today we had rice and stir-fried dishes for lunch. It's a pity you didn't come." He also told us that the children had an even better meal these past two days: soybean milk, eggs, and cakes in the morning, dumplings for lunch, and even meat for dinner.

    公社食堂就餐记
    吴珮
    我们有事到永丰人民公社所属的六里屯去。办完事出来，太阳已经偏西，赶回城里晚餐怕太迟，就在村里吃了吧。于是生产队长带我们就近来到了一个公共食堂。
    一进门，迎面就见墙上有一幅壁画。画的水平不算太高，但是很有气势。画的是山水树木、田野庄稼、房屋人物，颜色鲜艳，五彩缤纷，加之画中两峰之间一轮旭日初升，照得这一切分外光辉夺目。画的左上角还题着一首诗，头两句是：“人民公社风光好，青山绿山绕村庄”。
    这食堂是一个普通的四合院，有三个大饭厅和一个较小的招待厅。每个饭厅都是窗明几净，墙壁刷得雪白，四周挂着一些招贴画、剪纸画、对联，桌上复着碗筷，一尘不染，桌旁贴着用饭人的名字。招待厅的装饰更其精致，有一个大圆桌和四个小方桌，铺着雪白的桌布，放着茶壶茶杯，屋顶下面还悬着五色纸球。大饭厅是社员们用饭的所在，可以同时容纳二百来人。招待厅是供社员来客人时用的。
    队长把我们让进招待厅，泡上茶水，说：“虽说是招待厅，其实饭菜是和社员吃的一样的，除非愿意另外添菜。”我们连忙请他不要另外添菜，只愿和社员吃一样的就好。队长见我们意志坚决，也就爽快地应诺了。
    这时还不到开饭时间，一位炊事员进来招呼我们。他穿着白色工作衣，戴着白色工作帽，说话的时候，脱下口罩来，露出一副白净脸面，三十来岁年纪，给人一种洁净利落的感觉。我们之中一位同伴说：“你们这食堂搞得真不错呀，在村里算是数一数二了吧！”这炊事员可不大会讲话，老老实实地回答：
  “村里有十三个这样的食堂，都差不多，我们是中等的，搞得不大好，同志们吃过饭提提意见吧！”我们拉他坐下，请他谈谈食堂工作。
    这食堂共有五位炊事员，他是组长。他们都是在地里干活的。8月间办食堂，他们被群众选作炊事员。他们倒没有什么愿干不愿干的念头，就只怕做不好饭菜，因为他们都不是内行呀。但他们和别的食堂的炊事员一起，互教互学，每餐饭后又总要征求吃饭人的意见。到现在，他们不仅做得一手可口饭菜，而且餐餐不同样。做给老人、小孩、病号、孕产妇吃的饭菜，格外松软有味。他们五个之中有一个是妇女，四个男的就照顾她，不让她挑水做重活。吃水原本就在附近井里提取，后来他们发现这口井水有点咸，不好吃，就跑到很远的一口井去挑来，一天要挑上八十来担。晚上四个男的轮流值夜，准备给临时打夜工或城里回来的人热菜热饭，我们一位同伴啧啧地说：
  “这不太辛苦了吗？”他仍是老老实实地回答：“咳，说什么辛苦不辛苦，看见社员把食堂当成自己的家，半夜三更回来吃饭，我们真是打心里欢喜啊！”
    开饭时间近了，他又忙着张罗去了。不一会，村中响起一片吹号声。再隔一会，社员们三三两两，笑谈着，走进食堂来了，一个个上
  “洗手处”洗了手，到厨房领得饭菜，各就各座，吃起来了。这餐饭是粗粮细作，赤豆丝糕，酸菜汤，花椒油腌菜。别说劳动归来的社员们吃得津津有味，我们这几个城里人也吃得很有味道。一位社员跟我们说：“食堂的饭菜真不赖，比过去上中农吃得还好。今天午间吃的是大米饭，炒菜，可惜你们没来吃。”他还告诉我们，这两天孩子们吃得更好，早上豆浆、鸡子、糕、中午饺子，晚上还吃肉哩。
