On November 22nd, the Tianjin Steam Engine Factory was abuzz with excitement. People were frequently spreading a piece of good news: “The steam turbine generator has been successfully manufactured!” This steam turbine generator was made by the workers using the indigenous steel they had refined themselves! The workers overcame numerous obstacles, turning these broken and rusty scrap iron pieces into steel, the steel was then forged into materials, and finally made into a steam turbine generator.

Since the factory set up small hand-cranked converters to make steel using indigenous methods in early October, it had caused a great deal of controversy. Some people shook their heads and said, "How can we make steel?" Some even waved their hands, saying, "This is simply nonsense!" However, the few workers who were selected to make steel still wanted to give it a try. Once, twice, three times, they failed. The molten steel poured from the indigenous small converters and cast into ingot bars broke when hit with a hammer. When they took it to the forging section to make forgings, the steel ingot "collapsed" in the furnace as soon as it was put into the heating furnace. At this point, the skeptics had "reason" on their side. Some said, "Isn't this a waste? Iron, coke, and manpower are all wasted." "Forget it, how can you make steel with indigenous methods!" Even some of the people who were making steel felt discouraged. At this time, the Party branch and the Youth League branch realized that people did not have a correct understanding of indigenous steelmaking and its significance, so they organized the steelmaking workers to debate: "Can steel be made with indigenous methods?" "Why can others make steel, but we can't?" After everyone's debate, they found the reasons, mainly that they had not mastered the technology and that there were also ideological problems. Therefore, everyone went to the Third Tool Factory six times to learn the technology, from building the furnace to mastering the heat, they learned the whole process. By the eighth experiment, the molten steel was cast into ingot bars, and when hit with a hammer, it did not break or crack. "It's steel!" People suddenly became excited. The factory loudspeaker announced the news to the workers, and the good news was also posted on the wall. At this time, the doubters all gathered around.

Ingot bars were cast from one furnace of molten steel after another, but could these steel bars be forged into materials? People sent the steel ingots to the forging section for another "test." The forgers received the steel ingots and were also a little hesitant because the steel ingots had shattered as soon as they were exposed to fire during the last experiment. This time, they still carefully put the steel ingots into the heating furnace. Xu Jingchi said, "Keep the fire small, don't burn it to pieces again." However, to his surprise, the steel did not break. The two forgers took the red-hot ingot bar out of the heating furnace and vigorously hammered it with sixteen-pound sledgehammers. The steel ingot did not even have a crack. The forgers increased the fire and burned it again, until it sparked and the steel ingot was softened, but it still did not change or crack. Xu Jingchi said happily when he saw it, "Great, this steel can be used as a substitute for medium carbon steel!" Under the hammers of the forgers, one red-hot steel ingot after another turned into long, flat, round, and various unnamed shapes of blanks made according to the drawings.

The "test" of indigenous steel was not over. Could machines, or even more precise machines, be manufactured using steel materials forged from indigenous steel? The workers decided to conduct another experiment: to manufacture a ten-horsepower steam turbine generator using indigenous steel. Not long ago, the workers had made a steam turbine generator using foreign steel. Although this machine was only ten horsepower, the smaller it was, the more precise it needed to be, especially the main component, the impeller, which was composed of seventy-nine small blades, each weighing less than one or two taels. After nine processes such as turning, planing, milling, and fitting, it could not be made if the quality of the steel was slightly inferior. In the lathe section, Zhao Lianyuan, the leader of the milling and planing team, held a bright rectangular steel block and said to me, "Look, this is made of indigenous steel!" Indeed, after the surface of the steel block had been planed off by the shaper, no one could tell that it was indigenous steel. "Can this kind of steel be used to make impellers?" I asked curiously. He immediately said, "It's perfectly fine." He led me to look at the impellers being processed by the planers and millers, which were very delicate. The blade edges were as thin as paper. This thin blade had to withstand the high temperature of steam and not be deformed during high-speed operation at more than 3,000 revolutions per minute, and it also had to be elastic. After being planed by the planer and milled by the miller, it was sent to the fitter section for the final processing.

In addition to the main component, the impeller, which was made of indigenous steel, two other main components of the steam turbine generator—the main shaft and the impeller disc—were also made of indigenous steel. Making the disc from indigenous steel was still a concern for people. This disc was directly cast from the molten steel from indigenous furnaces. Would there be pinholes? What about the hardness? No one was sure. Master worker Liu Danning picked up a steel file and filed the casting a few times, revealing a white steel mark. Experience told him that this was good steel. "Okay, put it on the lathe and plane it!" He put down the file and said happily. Lathe operator Zhao Dehong started planing. As the chuck rotated rapidly, the cutting tool touched the disc, emitting a wisp of thin smoke. The disc was planed out, with no pinholes at all, and the quality was completely qualified.

Indigenous steel successfully passed every "test" from becoming steel, to becoming material, to becoming a machine.

    土钢展翅高飞
    新华社记者  朱泽民
    11月22日，天津蒸气机制造厂沸腾起来了。人们频频传告着一个喜讯：“汽轮发电机制造成功了！”这台汽轮发电机是工人们用自己炼出的土钢制成的！工人们过五关斩六将，把这些破破烂烂的废铁炼成了钢，钢又锻打成材，然后制成汽轮发电机。
    自从10月初，工厂里建立起手摇小转炉用土法炼钢时，就引起了好大的争论。有的人摇头说：“咱们怎么能炼钢？”有的人甚至一摆手，说：“这简直是瞎见鬼！”可是抽出来炼钢的几个工人还是想试一试。一次、二次、三次，都失败了。从土造小转炉里倒出来的钢水铸成锭条，用鎯头一打就断了，拿到锻工工段去打锻件，把钢锭往烘炉里一放，钢烧红就“瘫”在炉里。这一下，怀疑派就有“理”了。有人就说：“这不是白浪费吗？铁、焦炭、人力都浪费了。”“快算了吧，土法怎么能炼钢！”甚至连炼钢的人有的都灰心泄气了。党支部、团支部这时看出了人们对土法炼钢以及炼钢的意义还没有正确认识，就组织炼钢工人们进行辩论：“土法能不能炼钢？”“为什么别人能炼出钢，我们炼不出来？”经过大家辩论，找出了原因，主要是没掌握好技术，而且思想还有问题。于是大家就六次到第三车具厂去学习技术，从砌炉一直到掌握火候，全套都学来了。到第八次试验的时候，钢水铸成锭条，用锤一打，不断不裂。“是钢！”人们一下子就沸腾起来了，工厂广播器把消息告诉工人们，喜报也贴在墙上，这时候，半信半疑的人都围上来了。
    一炉炉的钢水铸成了锭条，可是这些钢能不能锻打成材？人们又把钢锭送到锻工工段去“考验”。锻工们接到了钢锭，心里也有点嘀咕。因为上次试验的时候，钢锭一见火就碎了。这次，他们仍然小心翼翼地把钢锭放进烘炉，徐晶池就说：“小点火吧，别再烧碎了。”可是，出乎他的意料，钢没有碎。把红红的锭条从烘炉里拿出来，两个锻工都抡着十六斤重的大锤加劲地打，钢锭连个裂纹都没有。锻工们又把火加大再烧，直烧到冒火花，钢锭都烧软了，仍然不变不裂。徐晶池一看，高兴地说：“太好了，这钢能顶中炭钢用！”经过锻工们手里的大锤，一条条火红的钢锭就变成了长的、扁的、圆的，还有叫不出名堂来的按图纸要求打的各种形状的毛坯。
    “考验”土钢的工作并没有完。能不能用土钢锻打的钢材制造机器甚至比较精密的机器？工人们又决定再作试验：用土钢制造一台十马力的汽轮发电机。不久前，工人们用洋钢制成了一台汽轮发电机，这台机器虽然只有十马力，可是越小越精密，特别是主要部件风叶，是用七十九个小风叶组成的，每个小风叶还不到一两重，经过车、刨、铣、钳等九道工序，钢的质量稍微差一点就制不成。在车工工段，铣刨组组长赵连元拿着一块亮堂堂的长方形钢块对我说：“看吧，这就是用土钢打的！”真的，经过牛头刨刨去了外皮的钢块，谁也看不出来它就是土钢。“用这种钢制风叶行吗？”我好奇地问道。他立刻说：“太行了。”他领着我看了看刨工、铣工正在加工着的风叶，十分精致，风叶的锋刃薄得和纸差不多。就是这个薄薄的锋刃，要经受得住蒸气的高温，并且在每分钟三千多转的高速运转中，既不变形，又要有弹性。经过刨工刨，铣工铣，又送到钳工工段作最后一道工序的加工。
    汽轮发电机除了主要部件风叶是用土钢制的以外，还有两个主要部件——主轴和风叶的圆盘也是用土钢制的。用土钢制圆盘还是人们担心的一个问题。这个圆盘是用土炉出的钢水直接浇铸的，会不会出沙眼，硬度如何？人们都没有把握。老师傅刘丹英拿起钢锉在铸件上锉了几下，就露出了白色的钢印，经验告诉他，这是好钢。“行，上床子刨吧！”他放下锉高兴地说。车工赵德洪就刨起来。随着卡盘飞快地转动，车刀触在圆盘上冒出一缕细细的青烟，圆盘刨出来了，一点沙眼也没有，质量完全合格。
    土钢顺利地经受住了从成钢，成材到成器的每一次“考验”。“
