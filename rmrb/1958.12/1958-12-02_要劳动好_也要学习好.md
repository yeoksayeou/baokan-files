How to establish a normal order in schools and ensure that students work well and study even better is an important issue worthy of attention.

Since the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, schools across the country have been running factories and farms on a large scale, and a vigorous new atmosphere has emerged. The students' mental outlook has undergone fundamental changes, the quality of learning has been significantly improved, and many students have also made valuable inventions. These facts show that the combination of education and productive labor is indeed the Marxist path for socialist education. This path can improve the quality of teaching, train the younger generation, and create conditions for gradually eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor. In the process of implementing this policy, any doubt or wavering is absolutely not allowed. However, while arranging labor production, attention should also be paid to appropriately arranging courses and strengthening leadership in teaching work. Lenin once said that neither education that is divorced from productive labor, nor productive labor that does not include education, can reach the level required by modern technology and the current state of scientific knowledge. We oppose blindly believing in books and belittling productive labor; but we should not only care about productive labor and relax teaching. Therefore, it is necessary to combine teaching and productive labor more closely and perfectly, so that students can both work well and study well. Only in this way can we establish a new order in schools that conforms to the socialist education policy and truly cultivate young students into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

To combine teaching and productive labor more closely and perfectly, the main issue at present is to make comprehensive and proper arrangements for both. The measures taken by Chengdu's secondary schools in this regard are worthy of our attention. Such proper arrangements can avoid turning productive labor into temporary crash tasks and can establish the order of a new type of socialist school.

In some vocational schools, the production tasks are too large, and teaching work cannot help but be affected to some extent. This is also unavoidable. If appropriate arrangements can be made, it can also be resolved. Chengdu Radio Industry School is a school with a large production task. With a positive attitude, they took a series of measures such as technological innovation while properly arranging labor organization and labor time. As a result, the production task has not changed, but the students' learning and rest have been guaranteed. These methods can be followed in various places.

    要劳动好  也要学习好
    周祖佑
    怎样在学校里建立起正常的秩序，保证学生们劳动好，学习更好，是当前值得注意的一个重要问题。
    自从贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以来，全国各学校大办工厂、农场，出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。学生们的精神面貌发生了根本的变化，学习质量有了显著提高，许多学生还作出了有价值的创造发明。这些事实说明，教育结合生产劳动，确实是社会主义教育事业的马克思主义道路。这条道路可以提高教学质量，也可以锻炼青年一代，还可以为逐渐消除脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别创造条件。在贯彻执行这一方针的过程中，任何怀疑和动摇都是决不能容许的。但是，在安排劳动生产的同时，也要注意适当安排课程，加强对教学工作的领导。列宁曾经说过，无论是脱离生产劳动的教育，或是没有同时进行教育的生产劳动，都不能达到现代技术水平和科学知识现状所要求的高度。我们反对迷信书本、轻视生产劳动；也不要只顾生产劳动，放松了教学。因此，必须把教学和生产劳动更加紧密完善地结合起来，使学生既能劳动好，又能学习好。只有这样，才能在学校里建立起符合社会主义教育方针的新秩序，把青年学生真正培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    要把教学和生产劳动结合得更加紧密完善，当前的主要问题是对这两者进行全面妥善的安排。成都市中等学校在这方面采取的措施，值得我们重视。这样妥善安排，就可以避免把生产劳动形成临时性的突击任务，就可以确立社会主义新型学校的秩序。
    有些专业学校，生产任务过大，教学工作不能不受到某些影响。这也是不可避免的。如果能作适当安排，也是可以解决的。成都无线电工业学校是生产任务较大的一个学校。他们以积极态度，在妥善安排劳动组织和劳动时间的同时，采取了技术革新等一系列措施，结果，生产任务并没有改变，学生的学习和休息却都得到了保证。这些办法，各地可以仿行。
