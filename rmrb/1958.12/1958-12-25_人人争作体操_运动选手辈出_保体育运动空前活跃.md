Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 24th (Reporter Li Cheng) reports: The Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Sports Association, G. Georgiev, said in a recent interview with this agency that the Bulgarian Sports Association has excellently and gloriously completed the tasks assigned to it by the Party this year.

Georgiev said that sports in Bulgaria are developing at a rapid pace, continuously popularized and penetrating deeply into the broad masses of the people. In 1956, Bulgaria held 54,756 various sports competitions, and in the first half of 1957 alone, 43,809. This year, the total number of people participating in the first stage of the Republic Sports Games (1958-1959) was 1,822,573, which is more than 600,000 more than the total number of people participating in various competitions throughout 1956. In this situation, 58,000 athletes of various sports emerged, and 39,143 people reached various standards of the "Ready for Labor and Defense" system.

By 1960, the number of people actively participating in sports in Bulgaria will double compared to 1957, and the number of people reaching various standards of the "Ready for Labor and Defense" system will also double.

Georgiev said that the Sports Association has achieved great success in the widespread promotion of production gymnastics this year. Currently, very few people in Bulgarian factories, enterprises, and institutions do not participate in production gymnastics.

Based on widespread mass sports, the technical level of Bulgarian athletes has improved. Now, they have firmly entered the ranks of the world's top ten in basketball, volleyball, freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling, gymnastics, weightlifting, chess, and other sports.

    人人争作体操  运动选手辈出
    保体育运动空前活跃
    据新华社索非亚24日电 记者李成报道：保加利亚体育协会中央委员会副主席格·格奥尔基耶夫最近在本社记者对他进行的一次访问中说，保加利亚的体育协会出色和光荣地完成了今年党交给它的任务。
    格奥尔基耶夫说，保加利亚的体育运动正在以飞快的速度发展，不断普及和深入到广大人民之中。1956年保加利亚举行了五万四千七百五十六次各种体育比赛，1957年只上半年就举行了四万三千八百零九次。今年参加共和国运动大会（1958—1959年）第一阶段的总人数为一百八十二万二千五百七十三人。比1956年全年参加各种比赛的人数还多六十几万人。大会在这种情况下出现了五万八千名各种运动选手，三万九千一百四十三人达到“劳卫制”各项标准。
    到1960年，保加利亚积极参加体育锻炼的人数将比1957年增加一倍，达到“劳卫制”各项标准的人数也要增加一倍。
    格奥尔基耶夫说，今年体育协会在普遍推广生产体操方面获得了很大成绩。目前保加利亚的工厂、企业和机关当中很少人不作生产体操。
    在广泛群众性的体育运动基础上，保加利亚运动员的技术水平提高了。现在，他们在篮球、排球、自由式摔跤和古典式摔跤、体操、举重、象棋等项目方面已经稳稳地进入世界前十名的行列。
