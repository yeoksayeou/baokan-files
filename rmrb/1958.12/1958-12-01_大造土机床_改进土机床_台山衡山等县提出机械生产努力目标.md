Mass Produce Indigenous Machine Tools, Improve Indigenous Machine Tools
Taishan, Hengshan and other Counties Propose Mechanical Production Goals

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th – After Guangdong Province's Taishan County mobilized the masses to vigorously produce indigenous machine tools and achieved remarkable results, they are now consolidating and improving their work, enabling the county's machine industry to develop rapidly from scratch, turning the indigenous into the foreign, and quickly changing the original backward state.

During the ball bearing campaign in August, the Fengshan Agricultural Tool Factory of Fucheng Township and the Fushi Township Agricultural Tool Factory first used wood and a minimal amount of iron to create three-and-a-half-foot lathes. Generally, each lathe could process fifty to sixty ball bearings per day, increasing efficiency dozens of times compared to manual operation. The county's relevant departments held an on-site meeting to promote this, quickly sparking a mass movement to manufacture indigenous machine tools. In less than a month, nearly a thousand units were produced throughout the county.

In order to maximize the role of indigenous machine tools, the Fengshan Agricultural Tool Factory recently arranged all seven self-made wooden machine tools in a row, installing a single main shaft in the workshop to connect the belts on each lathe. In this way, only one person is needed to operate all seven lathes simultaneously. Workers at this factory have also converted the indigenous lathe into a bicycle-style lathe, using bicycle chains instead of belts. Stepping on the pedals makes the wooden wheels turn very lightly and quickly. At the same time, a tool holder was added to the lathe surface, allowing two people to operate simultaneously.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th – Hunan Province's Hengshan County mobilized the masses to vigorously engage in mechanical production using indigenous iron, indigenous steel, and indigenous methods. The county's factories are being equipped with machines they themselves have made.

From November 5th to 15th, in ten days, the county produced eighty-two machine tools using indigenous methods, including forty-eight electric lathes such as gantry planers, shapers, and universal drills. The remaining various machine tools were made of iron and wood or of steel and cement. After these lathes were produced, they quickly used indigenous steel to manufacture more than 110 pulverizers and produced more than 10,000 pieces of over one hundred types of products such as large and small blast furnace accessories, sheet metal blowers, and slicing and shredding machines. These machines were immediately put into operation to equip the relevant factories. After equipping themselves by manufacturing machine tools, the county's agricultural machinery factory and the agricultural tool factories run by each commune vigorously carried out technological innovation to improve work efficiency. They are now continuing to produce new machine tools and machinery, striving to achieve the ambitious goal of semi-mechanization in the county's industrial and agricultural production next year.

    台山衡山等县提出机械生产努力目标
    本报广州30日电  广东省台山县发动群众大搞土机床取得显著成绩以后，正在进行巩固和提高工作，使全县机械工业从无到有、土中出洋，迅速改变原来的落后面貌。
    8月间搞滚珠轴承化时，这个县的附城乡的风山社农具厂和浮石乡农具厂首先用木料和极少的铁料造成三呎半的车床，一般每部每天能加工五、六十个滚珠轴承，比手工操作的效率提高了几十倍。县的有关部门召开现场会议予以推广，很快就掀起了群众性的制造土机床运动。不到一个月，全县就制成了近千台。
    为了使土机床发挥更大的作用，风山社农具厂最近把全部自造的七部木机床排在一起，只在车间里装上一个总轴，连住各车床上的皮带，这样只要一人操作，就能同时开动七部车床。这个厂的工人还把土车床改成自行车式车床，用自行车的车链代替皮带，脚踩时，木轮转动非常轻便快捷，同时在车面上多加了一部刀架，两个人便可以同时操作。
    据新华社长沙30日电  湖南省衡山县发动群众，用土铁土钢土办法，大搞机械生产，全县的工厂正在用自己造的机械装备起来。
    从11月5日到15日的十天中，全县用土法生产了八十二台机床，包括龙门刨床、牛头刨床、万能钻床等四十八部电动车床，其余各种机床都是铁木混制或用钢铁、水泥制成的。这批车床出世后，很快就用土钢铁制造出粉碎机一百一十多部，还生产出大、小高炉的配件、白铁鼓风机、切片刨丝机等一百多种、一万多件产品。这些机械立即把有关工厂装备起来，投入生产。这个县的农业机械厂和各公社自办的农具厂，在自己制造机床装备后，又大搞技术革新，提高工作效率，现在正继续生产新的机床和机器，为争取全县明年在工农业生产上实现半机械化的宏伟目标而努力。（附图片）
