    In Praise of New Emotions
    Yan Yuming
    We went as a group to visit the nursery in Jiangdian Village, Gaotang County. As we entered the courtyard, a group of healthy children, all around three years old, wearing new cotton-padded jackets and trousers, rushed towards us, shouting in unison, "Uncle! Uncle!" Some tightly grasped our hands, others tightly hugged our legs, all staring up at us with bright eyes and enthusiasm. When we picked them up, their faces lit up with joy and happiness.
    We were suddenly attacked by this innocent and fervent emotion, a little caught off guard, and really didn't know what to do. Because this kind of emotion carried a lot of weight, only seen when children see long-separated and longed-for relatives. But their enthusiasm was so universal and evenly distributed, treating everyone the same, regardless of whether you were male or female, old or young, fat or thin, tall or short, or whether you were enthusiastic or indifferent, they poured their ardent emotions into your heart.
    Thinking carefully, this unconscious expression of emotion is actually a praise of the new society, although this is not something the children can be aware of. Compared to this kind of emotion, the kind of emotion that only loves oneself and one's small group of people seems so dull and lifeless!
    Loving one's own children, relatives, and those closely related to oneself is right and necessary, but if one has no love or is indifferent to other children and other good people, then his love is selfish, narrow, and outdated. Compared to the children's new emotions, it appears particularly awkward and ugly.
    The new must transform the old, and even children can educate adults. We need to use these noble new things to wash away the low-level old things in our minds!

    赞新感情

    我们一伙人去参观高唐县姜店村托儿所。走进院子，一群穿着新棉袄新棉裤的健壮的孩子，年岁都在三岁左右，朝我们猛扑过来，嘴里一齐高声喊着：“叔叔！叔叔！”有些个紧紧握住我们的手，有些个紧紧地抱住我们的腿，都睁大了眼睛，热情地仰望着我们。当我们把他们抱起来的时候，他们眉飞色舞，笑得满脸欢乐和幸福。
    我们突然受到这种天真火热的感情的袭击，有点措手不及，真是不知如何是好。因为这种感情的分量很重，只有孩子看到久别渴想的亲人时才能看到。但他们的热情却是那样普遍而均匀，对每一个人都是一样待遇，不管你是男女老少胖瘦高矮，也不管你是热情或冷淡，他们都把火热的情感倾泄在你的心上。
    仔细想想，这种不自觉的感情的流露，实际是对新社会的歌颂，尽管这点不是孩子们所能意识到的。比起这种感情来，那种只爱自己和自己的少数人的感情就显得多么灰溜溜啊！
    热爱自己的孩子、亲人以及和自己关系密切的人是对的，必要的，但如果对其他的孩子、其他的好人却毫无热爱，无动于衷，那末，他的爱是自私的、狭隘的、陈腐不堪的，比起那些孩子们的新感情来，就显得特别狼狈难看了。
    新生的要改造陈旧的，小人也会教育大人，我们需要拿这些高贵的新东西把脑子里那些低级的旧东西洗刷干净！
