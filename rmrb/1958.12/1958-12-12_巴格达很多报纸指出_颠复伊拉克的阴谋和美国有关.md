Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 11th. Tass Baghdad 10th: According to sources here, the recently uncovered conspiracy against the government is the largest and most meticulously prepared of the past conspiracies. The conspiracy was planned to be carried out on December 9th or 10th. The conspiracy was exposed after a car transporting a batch of weapons and equipment to the conspirators in Baghdad was intercepted. Some mutineers were immediately arrested, and important evidence about the conspiracy was found on them. The weapons transported to them were prepared for sabotage, including machine guns, pistols, rifles, ammunition, and various military equipment, all of which have been confiscated. The Iraqi authorities have also obtained audio recordings of some of the conspirators.

Although many details of the conspiracy have not yet been clarified, it is now clear that the threads of the conspiracy are abroad. For example, "Al-Ra'i Al-'Aam" wrote that the US intelligence agency "knew in advance about the preparations and date of this criminal conspiracy against the Republic of Iraq."

"Sawt Al-Sha'b" published an article entitled "Imperialism is the Supporter of All Conspiracies Against Our Republic," saying, "It must not be forgotten that US-British imperialism is the main source of threats and the basic hostile force plotting conspiracies against our republic and the national liberation movement in the Arab East."

The newspaper pointed out that the planned bilateral agreements between the United States and Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, and the visits of prominent American figures such as McElroy and Rountree to Middle Eastern countries, all prove the imperialist policies of Western countries. The article pointed out that Rountree's visit "will inevitably promote the intensification of sabotage against the liberation movement of the Arab people, especially against our Republic of Iraq." "Sawt Al-Sha'b" emphasized that US Assistant Secretary of State Rountree's visit coincided with the uncovering of the subversion conspiracy in Iraq. The newspaper emphasized that this fact proves that "this conspiracy, like many previous conspiracies, was carried out by the colonialists, mainly the United States."

"Al-Zaman" believes that this conspiracy is related to Rountree's visit. It wrote: "It is not difficult to understand that Rountree's visit was to create conspiracies, especially conspiracies against the Republic of Iraq, because the Republic of Iraq has undermined the Baghdad Pact and seriously affected the position of imperialism in the entire Middle East."

"Al-Thawra" wrote indignantly that a dirty conspiracy has been exposed again, "This conspiracy was manufactured by the imperialists headed by the United States. The conspirators have been arrested. The people already know that the United States is plotting conspiracies against our republic again. The people have also heard that American diplomats have arrived in Lebanon. The people can easily connect this conspiracy with this visit."

### 巴格达很多报纸指出  颠复伊拉克的阴谋和美国有关

    巴格达很多报纸指出
    颠复伊拉克的阴谋和美国有关
    新华社11日讯  塔斯社巴格达10日讯：据此间消息，最近揭发出来的反对政府的阴谋案是过去历次阴谋案件中规模最大和准备得最周密的一次。这次阴谋计划在12月9日或者10日实行。当运送一批武器和装备给巴格达的阴谋分子的汽车被截获后，阴谋就败露了。一些谋叛分子随即被捕，从他们身上搜查出了许多关于策划阴谋的重要证据。运送给他们的武器是准备用来进行破坏的，其中有机关枪、手枪、步枪、弹药以及各种各样的军事装备，都已经被没收了。伊拉克当局还掌握了某些阴谋分子的录音带。
    虽然阴谋的许多细节还没有弄清楚，但现在已经明确，这次阴谋的导线是在国外。例如，“舆论报”写道，美国的特务机关“事先是知道这个企图反对伊拉克共和国的罪恶阴谋的准备情况和日期的”。
    “自由人民之声报”以“帝国主义就是反对我们共和国的一切阴谋的支持者”为题发表文章说，“不能忘记这样的一件事实，美英帝国主义是威胁的主要来源和阴谋策划反对我们的共和国和阿拉伯东方的民族解放运动的基本敌对力量。”
    报纸指出，策划中的美国同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦的双边协定和美国的显要人物如麦克耳罗伊、朗特里访问中近东国家这样的一些事实都证明了西方国家的帝国主义政策。文章指出，朗特里的这次访问“必然会促使对阿拉伯人民的解放运动、特别是对我们伊拉克共和国的加紧破坏”。“自由人民之声报”着重指出，美国助理国务卿朗特里的这次访问同伊拉克破获的颠复阴谋是在同一个时间内进行的。报纸强调说，这个事实证明，“这次阴谋同以往的许多阴谋一样，都是殖民主义者主要是美国一手干出来的”。
    “时代报”认为这个阴谋同朗特里的访问有关。它写道：“不难理解，朗特里的访问是为了制造阴谋，特别是反对伊拉克共和国的阴谋，因为伊拉克共和国搞垮了巴格达条约并且使帝国主义在整个中近东的地位受到严重的打击。”
    “革命报”愤慨地写道，一个肮脏的阴谋又被揭露了，“这个阴谋是以美国为首的帝国主义者制造的。阴谋分子已经被逮捕。人民已经知道，美国又在策划反对我们共和国的阴谋。人民还听说美国的外交官到了黎巴嫩。人民可以很容易地把这个阴谋和这次访问联系起来看。”
