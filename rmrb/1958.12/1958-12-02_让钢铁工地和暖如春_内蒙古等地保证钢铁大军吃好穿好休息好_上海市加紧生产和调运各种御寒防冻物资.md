Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 1st: Steel command headquarters in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have adopted various methods to prepare steel workers and indigenous furnaces for the winter. Full guarantees have been provided for the food, clothing, shelter, and normal production of over 400,000 steel soldiers and more than 1,600 indigenous blast furnaces throughout the region during the severe winter.

Now, dormitories, canteens, and cultural and recreational venues for steel workers have been built throughout the clusters of indigenous blast furnaces and mining sites, forming new villages and towns. The Ikezhao League transported more than 8,000 leather jackets to the steel army, in addition to a large number of leather mattresses, blankets, and felt shoes. Various localities have also adopted measures such as thickening walls, raising furnace bodies, converting cold air to hot air, building windbreak walls, and constructing underground furnaces to prepare indigenous blast furnaces for winter. All 247 furnaces in Tongliao City have been converted to hot air. Most of the indigenous furnaces in the Hulunbuir League have also been converted to hot air. These indigenous blast furnaces with cold-proof facilities are producing normally, and the quality of iron is also very good.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 1st: With the care of the whole party and the entire people, the steel army in Sichuan Province has received a large number of winter supplies.

As early as two months ago, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all localities to pay serious attention to and arrange for the winter life of the steel field army, ensuring that they eat well, dress warmly, and live well. Commercial employees in many regions gave priority to transporting the materials needed by steel workers in winter to various construction sites. In Wanxian, Fuling, and Daxian prefectures alone, more than 460,000 cotton-padded clothes, quilts, and vests have been successively transported to construction sites recently. The people of Dazu County sent more than 1,000 cotton-padded clothes, woolen clothes, cotton-padded trousers, and cotton-padded vests, and more than 900 cotton hats to more than 1,000 workers who were far away from their hometowns to smelt iron in the high mountainous area of Wanyuan, basically solving the problem of winter clothing for the workers.

Many blast furnace groups have built sheds and workshops. Many people's communes in Jiangjin County recently donated thousands of kilograms of wood, rice straw, and a large number of bamboo sheds to help workers build more than 1,000 sheds and more than 100 thatched houses, completely solving the housing problem for workers in the county. In Jiangzhang County, beds two feet above the ground were built in some sheds, and spittoons were placed at the entrances of the sheds.

Now, supply stations or service groups have been established in most areas with blast furnace clusters as the center to supply workers with daily necessities, non-staple foods, wine, and cigarettes. Now workers at general construction sites can eat vegetables. Workers in many blast furnace groups in Fuling and Daxian prefectures can eat pork two to three times a month. Banks, post and telecommunications, barbershops, and bookstores have also been set up next to larger blast furnace groups. Workers in Fuling Prefecture said that they are now "five not out of the construction site," that is, they do not leave the construction site for eating, seeing a doctor, getting a haircut, depositing and withdrawing money, and mailing letters.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 1st: Shanghai is speeding up the production and transportation of various cold-proof and freeze-proof supplies to support the steel and agricultural armies fighting in the deep mountains and fields in various places despite the cold.

Ten larger clothing and hat factories, more than 80 clothing handicraft cooperatives, and clothing stores are rushing to sew 50,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes for Qinghai Province. More than 7,000 housewives also participated in auxiliary work such as flipping cotton and sewing buttons. Of the 220,000 cotton-padded jackets and trousers sewed by Shanghai for Anhui and Guizhou, 190,000 have been loaded and shipped out.

Dark cotton cloth, underwear, and daily necessities needed in various places in winter are being produced and transported as production progresses. Up to now, the cotton cloth originally planned to be supplied to Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guangxi, and Henan this year, and the leather hats and cotton shoes supplied to the Northwest and Northeast regions, have all been shipped out.

This year, Shanghai's supply of cold-proof and freeze-proof materials to various places has increased compared with last year. The supply of main commodities such as dark floral cloth, melton, health shirts and trousers, cotton sweaters and trousers, cotton socks, scarves, flannel gloves, and wool yarn in the fourth quarter increased by 14% to more than double compared with the same period last year. Oils, cold creams, and clam oil for protecting the skin in cold weather are in great demand in various places. However, Shanghai production has encountered difficulties such as insufficient raw materials and packaging materials such as glycerin and stearic acid. The department store purchasing and supply station helped factories to collect these raw materials from all over the place. The supply of these three commodities in the fourth quarter will still be one and a half times more than the same period last year. The supply of glasses used to prevent wind and sand for workers and farmers during steelmaking and winter field production will increase tenfold in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year after iron sheets are used instead of copper and the specifications are slightly changed.

Severe winter has come to the Qinghai Plateau. In order to ensure the safe wintering and normal production of indigenous blast furnaces, most of the indigenous blast furnaces in Datong County have been moved underground. Ironmaking personnel also have a warm workplace.

    让钢铁工地和暖如春
    内蒙古等地保证钢铁大军吃好穿好休息好
    上海市加紧生产和调运各种御寒防冻物资
    据新华社呼和浩特1日电  内蒙古自治区各地钢铁指挥部采取多种办法，作好钢铁工人和土炉子过冬的准备工作。全区四十万钢铁大军在严寒冬季里的吃穿住和一千六百多个土高炉的正常生产，已经有了充分保证。
    现在，遍布各地的土高炉群和采矿点上，都修起了钢铁工人的宿舍、食堂和文化娱乐场所，形成了一座座新的村镇。伊克昭盟给钢铁大军运去的皮衣有八千多件，此外还有大量皮褥子、毯子和毡鞋等。各地还采取加厚墙、加高炉身、冷风改热风、搭避风墙、建地下炉等办法，作好土高炉过冬的准备。通辽市二百四十七个炉子全部实现了热风化。呼伦贝尔盟大部分土炉也实现了热风化。这些有了御寒设施的土高炉，生产都很正常，铁的质量也很好。
    据新华社重庆1日电  四川省的钢铁大军在全党全民的关怀下，已经得到了大批御寒物资。
    早在两个月前，中共四川省委就号召各地认真重视和安排钢铁野战军的冬季生活，保证他们吃好、穿暖、住好。许多地区的商业职工把钢铁工人冬季需要的物资，尽先运到各个工地。仅万县、涪陵、达县等几个专区最近陆续运往工地的棉衣、棉絮、棉背心就达四十六万多件。大足县人民给远离家乡到万源高山区炼铁的一千多名工人送去一千多件棉衣、绒衣、棉裤、棉背心，九百多顶棉帽，基本解决了工人的冬装问题。
    许多高炉群已搭建了工棚、工房。江津县不少人民公社最近献出成千上万斤木料、稻草和大批篾棚等，帮助工人搭建一千多间工棚、一百多间草房，使全县工人的住房问题全部解决。江彰县部分工棚里搭起了离地二尺高的床铺，工棚门口放了痰盂。
    现在，多数地区都以高炉群为中心建立了供应站或服务组，供应工人需要的日用品和副食品、酒、烟。现在一般工地的工人都可吃上菜蔬了。涪陵、达县等专区的许多高炉群工人每月可吃到两次到三次猪肉。较大的高炉群旁还设立了银行、邮电、理发、书店等机构。涪陵专区工人说，他们现在是“五不出工地”，即吃饭、看病、理发、存款取款和寄信都不出工地。
    据新华社上海1日电  上海正在加紧生产和调运各种御寒防冻物资，支援各地冒寒战斗在深山、田野的钢铁和农业大军。
    十个规模较大的服装、制帽工厂，八十多个服装手工业社和服装店，正在为青海省突击缝制五万套棉衣。七千多个家庭妇女也参加了翻棉花、钉钮扣等辅助性工作。上海为安徽、贵州缝制的二十二万件棉袄、棉裤，有十九万件已经装车外运。
    各地冬季需要的深色棉布、内衣和日用品，正在随生产随调运。到目前为止，原计划今年供应黑龙江、辽宁、山西、广西、河南等地的棉布和供应西北、东北地区的皮帽、皮棉鞋，已经全部运出。
    今年上海供应各地的御寒防冻物资比去年有了增加。深色花布、线呢、卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤、棉毛袜、围巾、绒布手套、毛线等主要商品，第四季度的供应量比去年同期增加14％到一倍以上。冷天保护皮肤的油脂、雪花膏、蛤蜊油，各地大量需要，而上海生产上遇到了甘油、硬脂酸等原料和包装材料不足的困难，百货采购供应站便帮助工厂四出收购这些原材料，第四季度这三种商品仍将比去年同期多供应一倍半。工人、农民炼钢和冬季野外生产时防风挡沙用的眼镜，在改用铁皮代铜制造和略为改变规格以后，第四季度供应量将比去年同期增加十倍。（附图片）
    严冬来到了青海高原。为了保证土高炉安全过冬，正常生产，大通县大部分土高炉已转入地下。炼铁人员也有了温暖的工作场所。
