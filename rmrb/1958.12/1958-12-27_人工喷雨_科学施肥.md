According to a report in the Guizhou Daily, the Weixing (Satellite) People's Commune in Guiding County, Guizhou Province, has adopted new management measures based on the characteristics of deep plowing and close planting of winter wheat this year. On the basis of implementing a contract management responsibility system, they have established technical specialist companies and are vigorously promoting mass scientific and technological research—adopting measures such as artificial rainfall, formula fertilization, and wood roller compaction—making the high-yield wheat fields lush green, and basically eliminating third-class seedlings.

The Luo Beihe high-yield wheat demonstration area of the Weixing Commune covers an area of one thousand mu. By the end of November, ten days after sowing, one-third of the seeds had not sprouted, and the sprouted seedlings were unevenly green and yellow. Faced with this situation, the masses developed feelings of fear and difficulty. Some cadres were also at a loss. After careful analysis, the commune party committee determined that only by relying on the masses and using advanced science and technology for wheat field management could they manage it well. It immediately drew more than 70 young commune members from various battalions to form a technical specialist company to study the field management of the Luo Beihe high-yield demonstration area.

After the technical specialist company arrived at the high-yield demonstration area, they first used rapid testing instruments to test and found that the soil fertility was uneven, and after the "alluvial soil" was deeply ploughed, the soil was loose, and moisture and fertilizer sank quickly. The yellowing of wheat seedlings was mainly due to malnutrition and lack of nitrogen fertilizer. Another part of the wheat seedlings had not emerged for a long time due to poor coverage during sowing and large hard clods on the soil surface, resulting in a lack of moisture. They mobilized the masses to use the germination agent naphthalene acetic acid mixed with clean water, using more than ten sprayers to carry out small-scale artificial rainfall, and at the same time universally applied nitrogen fertilizers such as synthetic urea and diluted manure water. For those with poor coverage and dry soil, they took measures to cover the soil, replant, and water. In this way, in just five or six days, all the wheat seedlings in the entire area emerged. The first use of machinery, medicines, and chemical fertilizers, combined with indigenous methods for seedling cultivation, proved effective, greatly enlightening the masses and boosting morale.

On December 6, the technical specialist company found that the seedlings were growing too fast, with the tender seedlings growing more than one inch taller in one day and night. However, they did not know if this was a good thing. They conducted a second test analysis of the wheat seedlings and found that the wheat seedlings had sufficient nitrogen fertilizer but lacked phosphorus fertilizer. If attention was not paid, it would result in thin and tall wheat stalks, weak root nodes, few tillers, and easy lodging. Based on this understanding, they universally applied a dose of phosphate fertilizer.

At the same time, based on foreign experience, the specialist company also asked carpenters to rush to make two fifty-jin wooden rollers, and applied compaction to the wheat seedlings that were more than four inches tall compartment by compartment to promote wheat seedling tillering, as well as to break up the soil, compact the soil surface, and consolidate the roots to prevent lodging. After doing this, the one thousand mu of wheat in the entire area was lush green and thriving. The farmers reflected that "In the past, advanced cooperatives farmed only with hoes and manure; now that the people's commune is farming, it's like a doctor treating a disease."

    人工喷雨  科学施肥
    据贵州日报消息  贵州省贵定县卫星人民公社根据今冬小麦深耕密植的特点采取了新的管理措施。他们在实行包干管理责任制的基础上，建立技术专业连，大搞群众性的科学技术研究——采用人工降雨、配方施肥和木磙镇压等措施，使丰产麦田一片翠绿，三类苗基本绝迹。
    卫星公社的骆北河小麦高额丰产坝，面积一千亩。到11月底已下种十天，还有三分之一的种子不生苗，已出土的部分麦苗也青黄不一。面临这一情况，群众中产生了畏难情绪。部分干部也束手无策。公社党委经过仔细分析，认定只有依靠群众，用先进的科学技术来进行麦田管理，才能管得好。并立即从各营抽调出七十多名青年社员，组成技术专业连，研究骆北河丰产坝的田间管理工作。
    技术专业连下到丰产坝后，首先用速测仪器进行测验，发现土壤含肥量不匀，“冲积土”深翻后土质酥松，水分肥分下沉快；麦苗发黄主要是营养不良，缺乏氮肥；另一部分因播种时掩盖不好和田土表质硬块大，水分缺乏，造成久不出苗。他们发动群众，用催苗剂萘乙酸兑入清水，利用十多部喷雾器，进行了小面积人工降雨，同时普遍追施人造尿、清粪水等含氮肥料；对盖种不好和土硬干旱的采取盖土、补种、淋水，这样仅五、六天时间，全坝麦苗就出土齐全。第一次使用机械、药物、化肥，土洋结合培苗见效，群众心窍大开，情绪高涨。
    12月6日，技术专业连发现幼苗生长太快，一昼夜嫩苗长高一寸多。但不知是不是好现象。他们又对麦苗进行了第二次化验分析，发现麦苗氮肥足，磷肥缺少。如不注意，将会形成麦秆细高、根节不壮，分蘖少且容易倒伏。根据这个道理，普遍追施了一道磷肥。
    同时，专业连还根据外地经验，连日请木工赶制出五十斤重的木磙两架，对四寸多高的麦苗逐厢施以镇压操作，以促进麦苗分蘖，并可碎土、压紧土表、盘根防倒伏。这样做了以后，全坝一千亩小麦一片翠绿茁壮。农民反映说，“过去高级社种田光是锄头大粪；如今公社种田，好比医生治病。”
