A Free-For-All
Lin Sheng

    The day before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting, the ministers of the seventeen-nation "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" met beforehand for a council meeting. If this meeting had any distinguishing feature, it was a grand free-for-all. We might as well glean some adjectives describing the conference from Western news agencies' reports to get a sense of it. Agence France-Presse (AFP) said it was "a turbulent meeting," the meeting "descended into a noisy and heated situation," and it was "a day of fierce squabbling." A Reuters reporter said the atmosphere at the meeting was "extremely tense," and it "nearly completely broke down." This Reuters reporter was also very observant; supposedly, when these ministers walked out of the meeting room after the meeting, they all had "long faces."

    What exactly was discussed at this meeting that filled the atmosphere with such "lethal intent"? It turned out to be nothing other than the dispute between the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area." This dispute had long been raging fiercely among the seventeen West European nations. Everyone wanted to overwhelm the other on this vital issue. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that the ministers of the seventeen nations were preparing for a major brawl when they came to Paris to attend the meeting and discuss issues. According to Reuters, the night before the seventeen ministers met, the "Free Trade Area" on one side and the "Common Market" on the other had already arrayed their forces. At that time, the eleven non-"Common Market" nations, led by Britain, held a late-night meeting at the British Embassy, preparing to "form a unified bloc." At the same time, the six "Common Market" nations were also anxiously discussing countermeasures, aiming to "form a unified front at the meeting."

    As soon as the battle lines were drawn on the 15th, the British representative immediately "launched a massive offensive" (AFP), advocating at the meeting that a date be set to discuss the issue of "long-term 'multilateral links'" between the "Common Market" countries and the "Free Trade Area." He also stated that Britain and the remaining ten countries believed that "reaching an agreement on a definite date is very necessary." However, the French Foreign Minister immediately retaliated. He said that discussions were possible, but "the issue of a date will not be resolved." Since it was said that the issue could be discussed, but which day? Only heaven knows. This was effectively a refusal to engage in discussions with Britain and the other ten countries. Without discussions, how could contradictions be resolved?

    After the first round ended, the second round immediately unfolded. Britain fired another shot at the meeting, suggesting that the "3% quota regulation," which had so far only applied to the six "Common Market" nations, be extended to the other eleven countries of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation." The so-called "3% quota regulation" means that the import quota for each item should be increased to at least 3% of the national production of that particular item.

    How did this suddenly appear out of nowhere, this "3%" quota? Wasn't the so-called "concession" that the "Common Market" countries had made to the other eleven countries last time only that the provision to reduce tariffs by 10% and relax import quotas by 20%, which was to be implemented from January 1 next year, would also apply to the eleven non-"Common Market" countries? It turned out that this was the second set of books of the six "Common Market" countries, only implemented within their own six countries. This second set of books is very different from the first set. For example, taking automobiles, France imports about six thousand vehicles from Italy and West Germany. According to the 20% increase rule, this import quota would be seven thousand two hundred vehicles. However, since France's production this year will reach about nine hundred thousand vehicles, Italian and West German manufacturers, according to the 3% rule, would have a quota of twenty-seven thousand vehicles to export to France. But Britain would still only have seven thousand two hundred vehicles, a difference of more than two times. Britain certainly would not agree to this.

    However, from the perspective of the "Common Market" countries, if the preferential treatment enjoyed by the six countries were equally granted to other members of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, while the beneficiary countries did not assume the obligations of the "Common Market," this would make the "Common Market" meaningless.

    However, it is said that the "Common Market" countries had considered making a concession to Britain, agreeing to the British proposal. But at the crucial moment, the French representative suddenly withdrew the agreement he had previously attempted to express on this proposal. The reason was said to be that Britain, due to the frustration of the first round, was preparing to consider revising its trade policy towards France in retaliation. Therefore, France opposed the British proposal on the grounds that it would "never negotiate under threat."

    Therefore, neither of these two agenda items reached an agreement.

    It seems that in this battle, Britain and France are the main opposing generals. However, West Germany, a major general under the banner of the "Common Market," did not provide much support to France, and there was even a hint of defection. It is said that West German Economics Minister Erhard repeatedly urged French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville not to be too aggressive. Later, Erhard even said that he did not believe that de Murville's views represented the views of the "Common Market" "six countries." West Germany originally wanted to profit from both sides, but now Britain is exerting great pressure by seizing West Germany's weakness on the West Berlin issue, and West Germany has temporarily wavered.

    But despite this, France seems to be unwilling to back down. On all battlefields of the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France is doing its utmost to fight for a place in the core of US-British leadership. News has it that when Dulles discussed the issue of France's demand for sharing leadership with de Gaulle on the 15th, the two sides had "deep differences." The British "Observer" also reported that France is staging a "sit-down strike" against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, obstructing all military plans and opposing the assignment of its fighter jets to the command of the "Allied" Supreme Commander, US General Norstad. More news in the past two days is that France will use its veto power to stall the work of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conference. It seems that de Gaulle is going all out, determined to make a big scene.

    The free-for-all at the ministerial council meeting of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" on the 15th has temporarily adjourned. According to Western news agencies, the battle is not over yet, and another meeting will be held later. The good show is yet to come.

    一场混战
    林生
    北大西洋集团理事会开会的前一天，十七国“欧洲经济合作局”部长先行碰头开了个理事会。要说这个会有什么特点，那就是一场大混战。不妨从西方通讯社的报道中摘些描绘大会的形容词来看一下。法新社说这是“一次不平静的会议”，会议“陷于吵闹激烈的局面”，是“吵得很厉害的一天”。路透社的记者则说，会上空气是“极度紧张的”，“差一点儿完全破裂”。路透社的这位记者观察得还非常仔细，据说，当这些部长们开完会走出会议室时都是“拉长了脸”的。
    这次会议到底讨论了什么问题，使得会场空气如此充满了“杀气腾腾”呢？原来不是别的，就是为了“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的纷争。这个纷争在西欧十七国中早就闹得很凶了。谁都想在这个性命攸关的问题上把对方压倒。因此这一次与其说十七国的部长准备到巴黎来开会讨论问题，倒不如说是来准备一场大厮杀的。据路透社报道，就在十七国部长开会的前一天晚上，以“自由贸易区”为一方，“共同市场”为另一方，双方早就摆开了阵势。当时以英国为首的非“共同市场”的十一国在英国大使馆漏夜举行会议，准备“组成一个统一的集团”。与此同时，“共同市场”六国也在紧张商量对策，要在“会上形成统一阵线”。
    15日战幕一拉开，英国代表首先“发动一个巨大的攻势”（法新社），在会议上主张确定一个日子来讨论“共同市场”国家提出的和“自由贸易区”进行长期的“多边联系”的问题。他并且表示英国和其余十国认为“就肯定日期取得一致意见非常必要”。但是法国外交部长当即还以颜色。他说，讨论可以，但是“不解决日期问题”。既然说问题可以讨论，但是哪一天呢？只有天知道。这实际上等于拒绝跟英国和其他十个国家进行讨论。不进行讨论又怎么谈得到能解决矛盾呢。
    第一回合结束之后，马上展开了第二个回合。英国在会上放了另一炮，建议把迄今只适用于“共同市场”六国的“3％的限额规定”扩大到“欧洲经济合作局”的其它十一个国家。所谓“3％的限额规定”就是指每一项货品的进口限额提高到至少是那一特殊项目的全国产量的3％。
    这里怎么突然杀出个程咬金，又来了个“3％”的限额呢？上次“共同市场”国家做出的所谓对其他十一国的“让步”，不是只说把明年1月1日起实行的降低关税10％和放宽进口限额20％的规定同样适用于非“共同市场”十一国吗？原来这是“共同市场”六国的第二本账，只在自己六个国家里实行。这第二本账跟第一本账是有大大的差别的。譬如拿汽车来说，法国从意大利和西德进口六千辆左右。根据增加20％的规定，这个进口限额将是七千二百辆。但是由于今年的法国生产量将达到九十万辆左右，意大利和西德制造商根据3％的规定，输给法国的定额就是二万七千辆。而英国却仍然只有七千二百辆，前后相差两倍多。英国当然不答应。
    但是，从“共同市场”国家来说，如果把六国所享受的优惠待遇同样地给予欧洲经合局其他成员国，而受惠国却不承担“共同市场”的义务，这样会使得“共同市场”变得毫无意义。
    不过据说，“共同市场”国家曾经考虑给英国一点让步，同意英国建议。但是到了紧要关头，法国代表忽然收回了曾经企图对这项建议所表示的同意。原因据说因为英国由于第一回合的挫折，而准备考虑修改对法国的贸易政策以为报复。因此法国鉴于“在威胁下决不进行谈判”的理由反对英国的建议。
    因此，这两项议程也都没能达成协议。
    看来，在这场战斗中，英法两国是对阵的主将。而西德这个在“共同市场”帅旗下的大将却并不对法国多加支持，有些倒戈的味道。据说西德经济部长艾哈德曾一再劝说法国外长德姆维尔杀气不要太大。到后来艾哈德还竟然说：他认为德姆维尔的观点并不代表“共同市场”“六国”的观点。西德本来是想两边沾便宜的，现在英国抓着西德在西柏林问题上的小辫子大施压力，西德也就一时动摇起来。
    但是尽管如此，法国看来是不准备退缩的了。在整个北大西洋集团的各个战场上，法国都在竭力为争取打入美英领导核心而大干一场。有消息说，15日杜勒斯跟戴高乐商谈法国要求分享领导权问题时，双方“分歧很深”。英国“观察家报”也报道，法国正在对北大西洋集团“静坐罢工”，阻挠一切军事计划，反对把它的战斗机归“盟军”最高司令美国将军诺斯塔德指挥。这两天更有消息说，法国将使用它的否决权，使北大西洋公约组织会议的工作停滞不前。看来戴高乐是一不做二不休，要大闹一场。
    15日的“欧洲经济合作局”部长理事会上的一场混战暂时休会了。据西方通讯社说，战斗还未结束，过一时再来开会。好戏还在后头哩。
