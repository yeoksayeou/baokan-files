Suoqian Commune Adjusts Team Cadre Composition

(Our Dispatch) The Suoqian People's Commune in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, ensured that poor and lower-middle peasants held a leading advantage when selecting cadres at the production team level, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses.

In the establishment of the Suoqian Commune, the majority of production team members were happy and full of energy, but some members of a few production teams had low morale and little enthusiasm for production, and some rumors appeared. In the small teams with these problems, the small team leaders were unwilling to specifically reflect the problems. The commune party committee discovered that some of the production team leaders were wealthy peasants who frequently hired short-term laborers before liberation, and a few were newly emerging middle peasants who bought land after the land reform. These people had a set of experiences in production, and most of them had some education, so they had some prestige among the masses. However, their capitalist ideology was serious. They were willing to work hard for things that benefited them, but they were insincere and disobedient for things that had few benefits or were difficult. In the struggle, they were unwilling to break face with landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, but they squeezed and打击 (attack) poor peasants.

After the commune party committee found out the details, it used these facts to educate all the branch secretaries, and convened a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasant activists, first educating them on the domestic and international situation, socialism, and communism. Because the leadership supported the poor and lower-middle peasants and improved their political consciousness, their enthusiasm was greatly increased.

The commune party committee submitted the cadre plan for the production team leader level to the masses for discussion. During the discussion, everyone listed facts to illustrate the benefits of having poor and lower-middle peasants serve as production team leaders. After the poor and lower-middle peasants were selected as cadres, they were very motivated and took the lead in all aspects of their work. For example, after the poor peasant Huang Xisong was elected as a production team cadre, he led the members in vigorously developing steelmaking, often working around the clock, which greatly moved the masses. Because the poor and lower-middle peasant cadres took the lead in hard work everywhere, significant achievements have been made in industrial and agricultural production, and the members' confidence in running the commune well has also greatly increased.

### 所前公社调整队干部成份

    所前公社调整队干部成份
    本报讯  浙江萧山县所前人民公社在选拔生产队一级的干部时，保证了贫农和下中农占领导优势，大大调动了群众的积极性。
    所前公社在建社中，大多数生产队的社员心情舒畅，干劲冲天，但是也有少数生产队的一部分社员情绪不高，生产劲头不大，并且出现了一些谣言。在有这些问题的小队里，小队长不肯具体反映问题。公社党委发现一部分生产队长在解放前是经常雇短工的富裕农民，少数是土改后买田地的新上中农。这些人在生产上有一套经验，大多数人又有一点文化，因此在群众中有一些威信。但他们资本主义思想严重，做工作对自己好处大的肯出力，好处少、困难多的就阳奉阴违；在斗争中对地主、富农、反革命分子不肯打破情面，对贫农却排挤打击。
    公社党委摸清底细以后，就拿这些事实教育全体支部书记，并且召开了贫农下中农积极分子大会，首先对他们进行了国内外形势、社会主义和共产主义教育。由于领导上给贫农与下中农撑腰，又提高了他们的政治觉悟，大大提高了他们的积极性。
    公社党委就把生产队长一级的干部方案交给群众讨论。在讨论中，大家列举事实，说明生产队长由贫农和下中农来担任的好处。贫农和下中农被选拔为干部以后，干劲很大，在各项工作中都起带头作用。如贫农黄锡松当选为生产队干部以后，带领社员大搞钢铁，常常通宵达旦，群众很受感动。由于贫农和下中农干部处处带头苦干，工农业生产都取得了显著成绩，社员对于办好公社的信心也大大提高。
