    Xinhua News Agency Report: Mongolia's Economic and Cultural Construction Achieves New Successes

    Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperativization Accelerates, Livestock and Grain Production Increases

    Universal Primary Education Achieved, Illiteracy Basically Eliminated

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Mongolian People's Republic has achieved great successes in socialist construction this year. Damba, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, spoke at the recent plenary session of the Central Committee and discussed the achievements in the development of the national economy. He pointed out that in recent times, the Party and the government have taken measures to develop and consolidate agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, improve livestock breeds, and increase the purchase prices of certain livestock products. The pastoral cooperativization movement has reached a new high. This year, both livestock numbers and grain production have increased compared to last year, and the industrial production plan for the first three quarters has also been completed. With the help of the Soviet Union and China, Mongolia has completed the construction of coal mines, confectionery factories, brick and tile factories, vegetable farms, and other projects.

    In discussing the improvement of the material living standards of the Mongolian people, the report stated that in the ten years from 1947 to 1957, the purchasing power of the Mongolian people doubled, the number of employees increased by 1.2 times, and the retail sales of goods increased by one times. In 1947, the national average consumption of cotton cloth was 23 meters per person, which increased to 34 meters in 1957; flour increased from an average of 40 kilograms per person to 77 kilograms.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Mongolian agricultural and pastoral cooperativization movement has been developing at an unprecedented speed and momentum in the past year. Currently, the number of herding households joining agricultural and pastoral cooperatives accounts for 56% of the total number of herding households, an increase of 21% compared to last year, and the number of livestock joining the cooperatives accounts for more than 60% of the total number of livestock.

    This year, a prominent feature of the Mongolian agricultural and pastoral cooperativization movement is its broad mass character. In pastoral areas, a movement is being launched for entire counties and townships to join agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. For example, in Bayankhongor Province, 68% of the counties have implemented agricultural and pastoral cooperativization, and in five provinces, including Boto and Övörkhangai, the number of herding households joining cooperatives has reached 68% to 77%.

    Another feature of this year's agricultural and pastoral cooperativization movement is the merger of many small cooperatives into large cooperatives, making these large cooperatives relatively large-scale economic units that include a variety of production activities. Each large cooperative owns approximately 10,000 to 25,000 head of livestock, and they are developing cultivation and other agricultural sectors to fully guarantee the grain needs of the residents and solve the problem of establishing a solid feed base for animal husbandry.

    The establishment of large-scale agricultural and pastoral cooperatives has promoted the development of production. The area of cultivated land has been expanded, and most cooperatives have overfulfilled the plans for delivering livestock products to the state.

    The rapid development of cooperatives has created conditions for better utilization of modern technical equipment in pastoral areas, increased agricultural and pastoral products, and strengthened the ties between urban and rural areas.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Mongolia's cultural and educational undertakings have also made great progress. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated among Mongolian residents aged eight to forty-five. This year, 97.7% of school-age children aged eight to twelve are enrolled in school. Mongolia has basically achieved universal primary education and has begun to promote seven-year compulsory education in large cities.

    This year, the number of students in Mongolian secondary specialized schools has increased rapidly, with the number of students in secondary specialized schools nationwide increasing from more than 5,000 last year to more than 6,000 this year.

    蒙古经济文化建设获新成就
    农牧业合作化加速发展牲畜和粮食增产
    实现普及小学义务教育文盲基本被扫除
    据新华社讯  蒙古人民共和国今年在社会主义建设方面获得了巨大成就。蒙古人民革命党中央第二书记达姆巴在最近召开的中央全会上作报告时，谈到了国民经济的发展成就。他指出，最近时期以来，党和政府在发展和巩固农牧业合作社、改良牲畜品种和提高某些畜产品收购价格等方面采取了措施。牧业合作化运动达到了新的高潮。今年牲畜数量和粮食产量都比去年有所增加，头三个季度的工业生产计划也已完成。在苏联和中国帮助下，蒙古已完成了煤矿、糖果点心厂、砖瓦厂、蔬菜农场等项目的建设。
    报告在谈到蒙古人民物质生活水平的提高时说，从1947年到1957年十年间，蒙古人民购买力提高了一倍，职工人数增加了一点二倍，货物零售额已增加了一倍。1947年全国每人平均可得二十三公尺棉布，到1957年就增加到三十四公尺；面粉从每人平均四十公斤增加到七十七公斤。
    据新华社讯  蒙古农牧业合作化运动一年来以空前未有的速度和声势向前发展。现在全国加入农牧业合作社的牧户已占总牧户的56％，比去年增加了21％，入社牲畜已占牲畜总头数的60％以上。
    今年，蒙古农牧业合作化运动的一个显著特点是它的广泛的群众性。在牧区，正掀起整个县、整个乡加入农牧业合作社的运动，例如巴彦洪果尔省便已有68％的县份实行了农牧业合作化，布多、前杭爱等五个省加入合作社的牧户也已达到68％到77％。
    今年，农牧业合作化运动的另一个特点是许多小合作社并成大社，使这些大社成为一个包括多种生产的比较大型的经济单位。每个大社大约拥有一万到二万五千头牲畜，它们正在发展耕作和其他农业部门，以完全保证居民的粮食需要，解决为畜牧业建立巩固的饲料基地的问题。
    大型农牧业合作社的建立促进了生产的发展，耕地面积扩大了，多数合作社都超额完成了上缴给国家的畜产品的计划。
    合作社的迅速发展为在牧区更好利用现代化的技术设备创造了条件，使农牧业产品增多，更加密切了城乡的联系。
    据新华社讯  蒙古人民共和国文化教育事业也有很大发展。在八岁到四十五岁的蒙古居民中已基本上扫除了文盲，今年，八岁至十二岁的学龄儿童中已有97.7％入学。蒙古已基本实现了普及小学义务教育，并已开始在大城市推行七年制义务教育。
    今年，蒙古中等专业学校学生增加得很快，全国中等专业学校的学生由去年的五千多人增加到今年的六千多人。
