Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Beijing Railway Station to bid farewell to the Korean government delegation: The full text is as follows: Respected Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung, respected comrades of the entire Korean government delegation, comrades, friends:

The Korean government delegation headed by Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung is about to depart for home.

For more than ten days, whether in our capital or in various places, the Chinese people have welcomed Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean government delegation like welcoming their own relatives. Today, the Chinese people are again bidding farewell to Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean government delegation like bidding farewell to their own relatives. At this moment of parting, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I would like to once again express my heartfelt thanks for the visit of Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean government delegation, and please ask Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung to bring the brotherly friendship of the 650 million Chinese people back to the fraternal Korean people.

Since thousands of years of recorded history, our two countries, China and Korea, have been the closest neighbors. More than sixty years ago, the rise of Japanese imperialism placed both of our countries in a position of being invaded at the same time. Especially after the "September 18th Incident," our two peoples were the closest comrades-in-arms in the common struggle against Japanese imperialism. In the past ten years, American imperialism has replaced the position of Japanese imperialism in the East, antagonizing the Chinese and Korean people and launching aggression against our two countries. Our two peoples have fought heroically side by side against the aggression of American imperialism.

Sixty years of history, especially the history of the past forty years, proves that in the common struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, the support and assistance given by the Korean people to the Chinese people is greater than the support and assistance given by the Chinese people to the Korean people. Now, the Korean people stand firmly on the eastern front of defending the socialist camp, making unremitting efforts to defend peace in the Far East and the world. Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean government delegation received a sincere and heartfelt welcome from the Chinese people in various parts of China, and this is by no means accidental. At this moment of farewell, I would like to ask Comrade Premier and the Korean government delegation to convey to the heroic Korean people the Chinese people's feelings of gratitude and respect for the Korean people.

Comrades, our imperialist enemies are common, and our socialist cause is also common. The majestic Changbai Mountain and the beautiful Yalu River closely link the people of our two countries together. The fighting friendship between the people of our two countries will develop for generations, and the poems praising the great friendship of internationalism between the people of our two countries will be immortalized in history!

Goodbye! Comrade Premier and all the comrades of the Korean government delegation! Wish you a safe journey!

    共同的事业把中朝人民紧紧连结
    两国人民的友情将世世代代发展
    周恩来总理欢送朝鲜贵宾的讲话
    新华社9日讯  周恩来总理在北京车站欢送朝鲜政府代表团的讲话：全文如下：敬爱的金日成首相同志，敬爱的朝鲜政府代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    以金日成首相同志为首的朝鲜政府代表团，现在就要启程回国了。
    十多天以来，无论是在我们的首都，无论是在各地，中国人民都像欢迎自己的亲人一样，欢迎金日成首相同志和朝鲜政府代表团。今天，中国人民又像欢送自己的亲人一样，欢送金日成首相同志和朝鲜政府代表团。在这个临别的时刻，我代表中国政府和中国人民，对金日成首相同志和朝鲜政府代表团的访问，再一次表示衷心的感谢，并且请金日成首相同志把六亿五千万中国人民的亲人般的友谊带回给兄弟的朝鲜人民。
    自从有史记载的几千年以来，我们中朝两国就是最接近的邻邦。六十多年前，日本帝国主义的兴起把我们两国同时置于被侵略的地位。特别是在“九一八”事变以后，我们两国人民在共同反对日本帝国主义的战斗中更是最亲密的战友。近十年来，美帝国主义在东方代替了日本帝国主义的地位，敌视中朝人民，发动了对于我们两国的侵略，我们两国人民又为反对美帝国主义的侵略并肩地进行了英勇的战斗。
    六十多年的历史，特别是近四十年的历史证明，在中朝两国人民的共同斗争中，朝鲜人民给予中国人民的支持和援助，多于中国人民给予朝鲜人民的支持和援助。现在，朝鲜人民坚定地站在保卫社会主义阵营的东方前线，为保卫远东和世界的和平进行着不懈的努力。金日成首相同志和朝鲜政府代表团在中国各地受到中国人民由衷的真诚的欢迎，这绝不是偶然的事情。在这个惜别的时刻，我愿意请首相同志和朝鲜政府代表团把中国人民对于朝鲜人民的感谢和敬佩的心情带给英雄的朝鲜人民。
    同志们，我们的帝国主义敌人是共同的，我们的社会主义事业也是共同的。雄伟的长白山和美丽的鸭绿江又把我们两国人民紧紧地连结在一起。我们两国人民的战斗友情将世世代代地发展下去，歌颂我们两国人民国际主义的伟大友谊的诗篇将永垂史册！
    再见吧！首相同志和朝鲜政府代表团的全体同志们！祝你们一路平安！
