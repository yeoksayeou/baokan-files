(Our Chongqing dispatch, December 12th) The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, while vigorously grasping production, pays attention to arranging workers' rest, entertainment, and learning, so that all factory workers can achieve good production, good rest, and good learning.

The factory's Party committee consciously guides workers to carry out the movement of working skillfully and fighting skillfully, so that most people can produce according to eight hours and have sufficient rest and entertainment time. At the same time, cultural and recreational activities are widely organized. In October and November, the factory's cinema screened hundreds of films, with an audience of about 40,000 people. In addition to the factory's own more than 600-member cultural troupe and 18 cultural teams which perform frequently, the factory has also repeatedly invited outside troupes to perform at the factory. In November alone, the factory invited several units such as the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Troupe, the Kaifeng Yue Opera Troupe, and the Nanchong Sichuan Opera Troupe to hold several grand performance evenings at the factory, with an audience of more than 10,000 people.

Although the factory's production is quite busy, since the second half of this year, the factory's part-work, part-study schools, workers' spare-time schools, etc., have basically been able to hold classes regularly, and the number of workers enrolled is constantly increasing. For example, the number of students in technical schools such as spare-time middle schools increased from 3,000 in June to more than 4,700 in November. The vast majority of workers have a very high enthusiasm for learning, and the number of people who attend classes on time often accounts for more than 95% of the total number of enrolled students.

Since the fourth quarter, thanks to the factory's attention to working skillfully and fighting skillfully in production, as well as appropriate rest and entertainment, production has been carried out in a more rhythmic manner, and the production efficiency of the vast majority of workers has been greatly improved compared to August and September. Many workers have improved their cultural and scientific levels due to their persistence in learning, and have achieved better results in production. According to statistics of 70 workers participating in part-work, part-study in several workshops, in the past month, they have used the principles they have learned, such as thermal expansion and contraction, the law of action and reaction, to put forward 149 suggestions in production, which have played a considerable role in improving production technology.

    建设机床厂生产生活一齐抓
    人人情绪饱满  个个干劲冲天
    本报重庆12日电  重庆建设机床厂在大抓生产的同时，注意安排职工的休息、娱乐和学习，使全厂职工做到生产好、休息好、学习也好。
    这个厂的党委有意识地引导职工开展巧干、巧战运动，使大多数人都能按八小时进行生产，有足够的休息和娱乐时间。同时，广泛组织开展了文化娱乐活动。在10月和11月份，厂区的电影院就放映了上百场电影，观众约达四万人次。除本厂六百多人的文工团和十八个文工队经常演出外，这个厂还多次邀请外面的剧团来厂演出。仅11月份，这个厂就邀请四川省川剧团、开封越剧团、南充川剧团等几个单位，到厂举行了几次盛大的演出晚会；观众达一万多人次。
    尽管这个厂的生产相当繁忙，今年下半年以来，全厂的半工半读学校、职工业余学校等都基本上做到了经常开课，职工入学人数还不断增加。如业余中学等技术学校的学员，6月份只有三千人，11月份增加到了四千七百多人。广大职工学习情绪非常饱满，按时参加学习的人数经常占入学总人数的95％以上。
    从第四季度以来，这个厂由于生产上注意巧干巧战，又有适当的休息、娱乐，生产比较有节奏地进行，绝大部分工人的生产效率都比8、9月份大大提高。许多工人由于坚持学习，文化科学水平有了提高，在生产上创造了更好的成绩。据几个车间参加半工半读的七十个工人统计，在最近一个月内，他们运用学到的遇热膨胀遇冷则缩、作用和反作用定律等原理，在生产上提出了一百四十九条建议，对改进生产技术起了相当大的作用。
