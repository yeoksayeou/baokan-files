    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 8th December. Iraqi Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Qasim, announced this evening that the Iraqi government has uncovered a major plot scheduled to be launched on the 9th and 10th of this month.

    The announcement stated: "This conspiracy, plotted by a handful of bad elements in collusion with foreigners outside Iraq, threatens the existence of the Republic and endangers the security of the Republic." The announcement said: "Let everyone understand that we are determined to crush and destroy any forces that attempt to threaten the interests of the people and endanger the interests of the country; from now on, we will never allow any party or any traitorous group to endanger the security of the country."

    The announcement also said, "We announce to the Iraqi people that we have obtained conclusive documents, money, and a batch of weapons related to this conspiracy. The planners of this conspiracy have been submitted to the People's Court (Special Senior Military Court) to be tried for their treason. We call on citizens throughout our glorious Republic to be vigilant and pay close attention to protect the republican system from being betrayed by subversives."

    Baghdad Television broadcast footage of the weapons seized by the Iraqi government from the conspirators, including light machine guns, rifles, pistols, and other munitions. The government also confiscated 3,000 dinars used for the conspiracy, as well as a checkbook from a French bank. The checkbook showed that 12,000 dinars had been withdrawn in the previous three days.

    伊拉克破获重大颠复阴谋案
    卡塞姆号召人民提高警惕保卫共和国
    新华社巴格达8日电  伊拉克总理兼武装部队总司令卡塞姆今天晚间发表公告说，伊拉克政府破获了一件预定在本月9日、10日发动的重大阴谋案。
    公告说：“这个由一部分坏分子勾结伊拉克外部的外国人所策划的阴谋，威胁到共和国的存在，危害了共和国的安全。”公告说：“让所有的人都了解，我们决心粉碎和摧毁任何妄图威胁人民利益、危害国家利益的势力；今后我们绝不容许任何方面或任何叛国集团来危害国家的安全。”
    公告还说，“我们向伊拉克人民宣布：我们已经掌握了关于从事这一阴谋的确凿的文件、金钱和一批武器。这一阴谋的策划者已经提交人民法庭（特别高级军事法庭），以审判他们的叛国罪。我们要求公民们在我们光荣的共和国全国各地提高警惕，严密注意，以保护共和制度不为颠复分子所出卖。”
    巴格达电视台在节目中放映了伊拉克政府所缴获的阴谋分子的武器，其中有轻机枪、步枪、手枪和其他军火。政府还没收了用来进行阴谋活动的款项三千第纳尔以及法国银行的支票本。从支票本上可以看出，在前三天中就有人提取了一万二千第纳尔。
