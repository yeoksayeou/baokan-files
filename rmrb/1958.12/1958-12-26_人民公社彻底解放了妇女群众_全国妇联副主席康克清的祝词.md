Dear Comrades:
You have come from the vast countryside of the motherland to the great capital of Beijing, gloriously attending this conference, bringing outstanding labor achievements. On behalf of the All-China Women's Federation, I extend warm congratulations to you and to all the brothers and sisters on the agricultural production front.

Over the past year, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the socialist and communist consciousness of the people across the country has been greatly enhanced. Comprehensive leaps forward have been achieved in industrial and agricultural production, as well as in science, culture, and education. In a very short period, the people's communes have demonstrated tremendous superiority. We have come to realize that people's communes are conducive to the rapid development of socialist construction, guide the people of the whole country towards an increasingly happy life, and are also the path to the complete liberation of women. Through the communes organizing production, developing diversified operations, and rationally arranging labor, women are able to participate in various social labor. Through the communes organizing life and running collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, women's labor power has been further liberated. After greatly reducing household labor, women have ample time to study culture and technology, improve their skills for construction, and can better contribute to socialist construction. Many communes have implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply on the basis of huge agricultural yields. Women have begun to directly receive their own wages, enabling them to become fully equal members of society and the family. This has developed democratic and harmonious family life and further promoted the demise of the feudal patriarchal system.

In 1958, the people of our country have achieved unprecedented great victories on all fronts of socialist construction. We firmly believe that in 1959, everyone will continue to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, unite the broad masses, wholeheartedly run the people's communes well, and guide the communes' production and life towards a healthy development path. Strive to complete and over fulfill the 1959 national construction plan and achieve an even greater leap forward than in 1958.

For a better leap forward, we need to combine hard work and clever work, continuously improve labor efficiency, reduce labor intensity, and enable each labor force to play a greater role. To achieve this, everyone must strive to learn production technology and improve their cultural level, and our women have an even greater need for this. You are all leaders in the mass movement. We hope that in production labor, you will often help the broad masses of women learn technology, improve their culture, encourage them to learn new technologies, use new tools, improve old tools, and boldly create inventions, so that men and women can advance together in the technical revolution and cultural revolution.

At the same time, in order to maintain the lasting enthusiasm of the broad masses of women, in the entire measures of improving labor organization, reforming labor tools, and rationally arranging labor force, it is also necessary to take care of the physiological characteristics of women and continue to widely promote the method of "three adjustments and three no adjustments," that is, during menstruation, adjust to dry work instead of wet work, during pregnancy, adjust to light work instead of heavy work, and for breastfeeding mothers, adjust to nearby work instead of distant work. This method has been implemented in many places and has had good results. Recently, the central government instructed that women should pay attention to not doing heavy work, not going into cold water, and not staying up late during menstruation; women should have a certain amount of rest time before and after childbirth, and so on. These regulations are not only for protecting the health of women and children, but also a major issue related to the sustained labor of half of the labor force, and a major issue related to the healthy growth of future generations. We hope that you will often publicize the central government's regulations on protecting women and children among the broad masses, advocate learning knowledge of maternal and child hygiene, and implement them together based on local conditions to further change some ideological remnants of discrimination against women and children left over from the old society and change some bad habits so that the health of the people of our country will be stronger from generation to generation.

While vigorously engaging in production, we must also vigorously engage in life. After the people's communes, various collective living and welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens have been established in large numbers in various places, enabling women to concentrate more energy and focus on production. However, at present, these undertakings, whether in terms of quantity or quality, still need to be further developed and improved. The people of the whole country, especially women, hope to run these collective living and welfare undertakings better. Nurseries should be flexible and diverse, such as day care, full care, and breastfeeding rooms, according to local conditions and the needs of the masses, to give mothers more convenience. When parents see that their children are eating well, living well, growing well, playing well, and being taught well in nurseries and kindergartens, their labor enthusiasm will be even higher, and production and learning can be completed even better. The same is true for eating. In public canteens, everyone should be able to eat their fill, eat well, eat warmly, and eat cleanly and hygienically; and also take care of the needs of various people such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, lying-in women, breastfeeding mothers, and patients; and try to make everyone satisfied. Facts have proved that the better these undertakings are run, the more energetic and cheerful men and women, old and young, will be, the higher their political enthusiasm will be, the more they will love the commune, and the greater their enthusiasm for production will be. These works are all works that care for people and love people, and are all noble undertakings that serve the people. Now the local party committees are vigorously carrying out this work. We believe that in the future, everyone will surely work together under the unified leadership of the Party, strengthen cooperation, and make joint efforts to run these undertakings better. Our women's federations at all levels are further educating the masses of women to actively participate in these noble undertakings that serve the people according to the needs of the commune. The female representatives present here should also be concerned about the production and life of the masses of women. In production, you must consciously work and give play to soaring energy, and at the same time, pay attention to your health and safe production. You must be meticulous in caring for the surrounding women. When encountering difficulties, you must report to the leaders and consult with the masses in order to solve the problems in time.

Dear fellow representatives! The new year is coming, and the Party has clearly pointed out the goals to strive for in 1959. We warmly wish you all: forever under the leadership of the Party, maintain the glory of advanced collectives, expand the ranks of advanced collectives, continue to play a backbone and leading role in various productions and various tasks, and work hard together with the people of the whole country to victoriously complete the glorious tasks of 1959!

    人民公社彻底解放了妇女群众
    全国妇联副主席康克清的祝词亲爱的同志们：
    你们带着出色的劳动成就，从祖国辽阔的农村，来到伟大的首都北京，光荣地出席这次大会。我谨代表全国妇联向你们，向农业生产战线上的全体兄弟姊妹们，致以热烈的祝贺。
    一年来，全国人民在中共中央的领导下，社会主义、共产主义觉悟大大提高了。工农业生产和科学文化教育事业，都获得了全面大跃进。在很短的时间内，人民公社已经显示了巨大优越性。我们已经体会到：人民公社是有利于社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，是引导全国人民走向日益幸福的生活，也是妇女彻底解放的道路。通过公社组织生产，发展多种经营，合理安排劳力，使妇女们能够参加各种各样社会劳动；通过公社组织生活，举办公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利事业，使妇女劳动力获得了进一步解放，妇女们在大大减轻了家务劳动以后，有充裕的时间学习文化技术，提高建设本领，也就能够更好地为社会主义建设出力了。许多公社在农业巨大丰产的基础上实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，妇女们开始直接取得自己的工资，使妇女在社会上和家庭中能成为完全平等的一员，这就发展了民主和睦的家庭生活，更进一步促进了封建的家长制的消亡。
    1958年我国人民在社会主义建设的各个战线上已经取得空前伟大胜利，我们坚信，1959年大家一定会继续贯彻执行党的建设社会主义总路线，党的八届六中全会的精神，团结广大群众，全力办好人民公社，使公社的生产和生活走向健全发展的道路；争取完成和超额完成1959年国家建设计划，争取实现比1958年更伟大的跃进。
    为了更好地跃进，就需要我们将实干苦干和巧干结合起来，不断地提高劳动效率，减轻劳动强度，使每个劳动力都能发挥更大的作用。要做到这一点，大家都要努力学习生产技术和提高文化水平，我们妇女们更有这个需要。你们都是群众运动中的带头人，希望你们在生产劳动中，经常帮助广大妇女群众学习技术，提高文化，鼓励她们学会新技术，使用新式工具，改良旧工具，大胆创造发明，在技术革命、文化革命运动中，男女共同前进。
    同时，为了保持广大妇女的持久干劲，在改善劳动组织，改革劳动工具，合理安排劳动力的整个措施中，还要照顾妇女的生理特点，继续普遍地推广“三调三不调”的办法，就是月经期间调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳母亲调近不调远。这个办法，在许多地方已经实行，效果很好。最近中央指示，妇女在月经期间要注意不作重活，不下冷水，不要熬夜；妇女在产前产后要有一定的休息时间等等。这些规定，不仅是为了保护妇女儿童的健康，而且是关系到一半劳动大军持久劳动的大事，是关系到子孙后代健康成长的大事。希望你们在广大群众中，经常宣传中央关于保护妇女儿童的这些规定，提倡学习妇幼卫生知识，并且根据当地具体情况，共同贯彻执行，进一步改变旧社会遗留下来的歧视妇女儿童的某些思想残余，改变某些不良的习惯，使我国人民的健康，一代比一代更强。
    在大搞生产的同时，还要大搞生活。人民公社化以后，各地已经大量地举办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等各种集体生活福利事业，使妇女能够集中更多的精力，专心生产。但是，目前这些事业，无论从数量和质量上来说，都还需要进一步地发展和提高。全国人民，特别是妇女们，都希望把这些集体生活福利事业办得更好。托儿所，要根据当地的条件和群众的需要，可以办日托、全托、哺乳室等灵活多样，给以母亲更多的方便。当父母们看到自己的孩子在托儿所、幼儿园里吃得好，住得好，长得好、玩得好，也教得好的时候，他们的劳动积极性就更高了，生产、学习就能完成得更好。对于吃饭也是一样，在公共食堂里，要让大家都能吃得饱、吃得好、吃得暖和，又吃得干净卫生；还要照顾老人、小孩、孕妇、产妇、哺乳的母亲、病人等各种人的需要；尽可能做到人人称心如意。事实证明，这些事业办得越好，男女老少就更加精神饱满，心情舒畅，政治热情就更高，更加爱护公社，生产的劲头更大。这些工作都是关心人，爱护人的工作，都是为人民服务的崇高事业。现在各地党委已经大力进行这项工作。我们相信，今后大家一定会在党的统一领导下，搞好协作，共同努力，把这些事业办得更好。我们各级妇联组织，正在进一步教育妇女群众，根据公社的需要，积极参加这些为人民服务的崇高事业。在座的女代表们，更要关心妇女群众的生产和生活。在生产中，你们要自觉地劳动，发挥冲天干劲，同时还要注意身体健康，安全生产。对周围的妇女一定要做到无微不至地关心，遇到困难，要向领导反映，和群众商量，以便及时解决问题。
    亲爱的全体代表同志们！新的一年就要到了，党已经明确地指出了1959年奋斗的目标。我们热烈地预祝大家：永远在党的领导下，保持先进集体的光荣，扩大先进集体的队伍，在各项生产、各项工作中，继续起骨干带头作用，和全国人民一起，为胜利地完成1959年的光荣任务而努力奋斗！
