    Transporting Equipment Across Vast Distances; Serving the Steel Commander, Rendering Meritorious Service
    (Our dispatch) Transporting equipment, materials, and blueprints urgently needed by the "Steel Commander" at the fastest speed, contributing to "One-Zero-Seven-Zero" (likely refers to a specific project or target). This is a piece of good news that the civil aviation department presents to the people of the whole country on the eve of the New Year.
    As early as August, the Civil Aviation Administration of China organized a "Steel Transportation Command Office" to give full play to the role of the air "vanguard" to serve the "Steel Commander." An air force unit also dispatched transport aircraft, unifiedly dispatched by the "Steel Transportation Command Office." As of mid-December, this powerful air transport team had dispatched more than a thousand sorties, flying more than five thousand hours. In these few months, the electric motors and blowers transported by air alone could equip facilities producing 1.9 million tons of steel; in addition, it also transported round steel, chrome steel, steel, silicon iron, instruments and other materials, and transported more than ten tons of blast furnace design drawings.
    In order to strive for more loading and faster transportation and send all kinds of equipment to the furnace as soon as possible, the high-altitude transporters, under the principle of ensuring flight safety, adopted methods such as refueling in stages and selecting the most appropriate wind speed layer for flying, so that the transportation efficiency of each aircraft increased by more than 30%. Station staff also cooperated closely, improved operating methods, rushed to load and unload, and ensured the smooth flight of aircraft. For example, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry printed a large number of standard blast furnace design drawings. After they were printed, it was already late at night. The staff of the Beijing Civil Aviation Business Office completed the air transport procedures overnight, sent them to the airport by car, and the next day all were transported from Beijing to fifteen cities in fourteen provinces.
    The active actions of this air steel transport team have been praised by all relevant parties. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company presented a banner to the aviation station, which read: "Transporting Equipment Across Vast Distances; Spirit of Cooperation Shakes the Heavens."
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry presented a banner and sent a letter to the air transport team. The letter read: "Air transport supports the transportation of metallurgical equipment, promoting the victorious realization of doubling steel production."

    长空万里运器材  服务钢帅立功劳
    本报讯  以最快的速度，运输了钢帅急需的设备、器材和图纸，为“一○七○”贡献了力量。这是民用航空部门在新年前夕，送给全国人民的一份喜报。
    早在8月间，中国民用航空局就组织了“钢铁运输指挥办公室”，充分发挥空中“先行官”的作用，为钢帅效劳。空军某部也派出运输机群，由“钢铁运输指挥办公室”统一调度。截至12月中旬，这支强大的空中运输队，已经出动了千余架次，飞行五千多小时。在这几个月中，仅空运的电动机、鼓风机就可以装备生产一百九十万吨钢的设备；此外，还运送了圆钢、铬钢、钢材、矽铁、仪表等器材，运送了十余吨高炉设计图纸。
    为了争取多装快运，把各种设备尽快地送到炉旁去，高空的运输手们在确保飞行安全的原则下，采取了分段加油、选择最适当的风速层飞行等办法，使每架飞机运输效率提高30％以上。场站工作人员也密切协作，改进操作方法，抢装抢卸，保证飞机顺利飞行。例如，冶金工业部曾经印制了大批高炉标准设计图纸，赶印出来以后，已临深夜，北京民航营业处的工作人员连夜办理空运手续，用汽车送到机场，第二天就全部由北京运到十四个省的十五个城市。
    这支空中钢铁运输队的积极行动，受到各有关方面的称赞。重庆钢铁公司向航空站赠了一面锦旗，上面写道：“长空万里运设备，协作精神震天堂”。
    冶金工业部曾给航空运输队赠旗，写信，信上写道：“航空运输支援运送冶金设备，促进了钢产翻一番的胜利实现。”
