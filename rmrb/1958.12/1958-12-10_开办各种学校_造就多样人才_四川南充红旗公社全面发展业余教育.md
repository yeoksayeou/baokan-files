Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 9th. The Hongqi Commune in Nanchong County, Sichuan, based on the characteristics of the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and the needs of the comprehensive development of various production and work aspects, has established Hongzhuan (Red and Expert) schools encompassing various majors. This has enabled 95% of the commune members in the prime of their lives to participate in learning. The commune members praised in poems: "The state and the masses spend no money, all kinds of talents are trained, a great change will occur in three years, teachers and students are all Red and expert."

The Hongzhuan school established by the Hongqi Commune has seven majors, including agriculture, industry, finance and economics, teacher training, medicine, military sports, and social services. It has twenty departments, including grain crops, sericulture, machinery, chemical industry, accounting, education, literature and art, obstetrics, epidemic prevention, military affairs, sewing, hairdressing, and nutrition and hygiene. These departments absorb cadres and members from various professions within the commune to participate in learning. For example, the three departments of machinery, chemical industry, and civil engineering in the industrial field mainly recruit employees from the commune's seven larger factories, such as machinery, agricultural tools, and fertilizers, to study. The finance and economics major enrolls financial personnel from various production teams and factories to study. The students in the social services major are mainly cooks, tailors, and hairdressers from the commune's public canteens. In this way, seven thousand five hundred and thirty out of the seven thousand nine hundred and forty young and middle-aged commune members are enrolled in the school. They learn the knowledge they urgently need in the Hongzhuan school.

Under the unified leadership of the commune's Party committee, this Hongzhuan school completely unifies the learning organization with the production organization. The secretary and deputy secretary of the commune's Party committee, and the director and deputy director of the commune, respectively serve as the principal and vice-principal of the school. They also form a school affairs management committee with the heads of various units such as the commune's factories, agricultural science departments, and hospitals. The heads of these units also serve as the leaders of each major. Each production or work unit in the commune is a department or sub-department under the major. For example, the machinery factory is the machinery department of the school, and the sericulture production team is the sericulture department of the school. The heads of the departments are also concurrently held by the factory directors and production team leaders. In this way, the commune can comprehensively arrange the production and learning of the commune members and closely integrate the two.

The issue of teachers for this Hongzhuan school is resolved by adopting the method of "those who are capable are teachers, and materials are obtained locally." A total of 420 teachers were hired by the school. Cadres from the Party committee, administration, and Communist Youth League are political teachers; technicians, veteran workers, veteran farmers, veteran doctors, advanced producers, and advanced workers are technical teachers; cultural teachers are cadres, members, or employees with higher cultural levels. The masses said: These teachers have production skills and can solve practical problems.

The Hongzhuan school compiles teaching materials independently according to the needs of production and work. When compiling teaching materials, the students are first organized to discuss and put forward learning requirements, and then the teachers and student representatives compile them based on these opinions, and the Party committee reviews and revises them. Learning time and learning forms are flexibly arranged according to the production and work conditions of the students. Agricultural majors generally bring the blackboard to the fields and construction sites to organize students to study during rest. Industrial majors study in factories every night. Medical, teacher training, and social service majors study collectively for two or three nights a week, and students study by themselves at ordinary times, and collective research is carried out during centralized study when problems are discovered.

The Hongzhuan school of the Hongqi Commune was opened in mid-September this year. Before this, illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in this commune was basically eliminated. After the opening of the Hongzhuan school, it has played a considerable role in various production and work aspects. Students in agricultural majors have generally mastered advanced planting techniques for crops such as wheat and rapeseed. Some students have also created advanced technologies and tools such as pea strip sowing, wheat strip sowing opener, and wheat cover box, improving work efficiency by a quarter to four times. Students from the fertilizer factory successfully trial-produced eight kinds of fertilizers in their studies, and produced 800,000 jin of fertilizers in one month, catching up with the needs of spring crop sowing. Among the students in the teacher training major, thirty-five kindergarten teachers had no teaching experience before. After teaching and learning, and exchanging experiences with each other, they can now all prepare lesson plans, and some can even write poems as teaching materials for children. (Attached picture)

### 开办各种学校  造就多样人才  四川南充红旗公社全面发展业余教育

    开办各种学校  造就多样人才
    四川南充红旗公社全面发展业余教育
    新华社成都9日电  四川南充县红旗公社根据工农商学兵结合的特点和各项生产、工作全面发展的需要，建立包括多种专业的红专学校，使占全社青壮年总数95％的社员都参加了学习。社员们用诗歌赞扬说：“国家群众不花钱，样样人才都训练，三年之后大变样，师生个个红又专”。
    红旗公社开办的红专学校，共有农业、工业、财经、师范、医学、军事体育、社会服务等七个专业，设立粮食作物、蚕桑、机械、化工、会计、教育、文艺、妇产、防疫、军事、缝纫、理发、营养卫生等二十个系、科。这些系、科分别吸收社内各个专业的干部和社员参加学习。比如，工业方面的机械、化工、土木工程三个系，主要吸收公社中机械、农具、化肥等七个较大工厂的职工学习，财经专业招收各生产队和工厂的财务人员学习。社会服务专业的学员以社里的公共食堂炊事员、缝纫员、理发员等为主。这样，全社七千九百四十个青壮年社员中，就有七千五百三十人入学。他们在红专学校里学习他们迫切需要的知识。
    在公社党委统一领导下，这个红专学校把学习组织与生产组织完全统一起来。公社党委书记、副书记和社长、副社长分别担任学校校长和副校长，还与社内工厂、农业科、医院等各单位负责人组成校务管理委员会。这些单位的负责人并分别担任各专业的领导职务。社内每个生产或工作单位就是专业下面的一个科或系。如机械厂是学校的机械系，蚕桑生产队是学校的蚕桑系。系主任也都由厂长、生产队长兼任。这样，公社就便于全面安排社员的生产和学习，把两者紧密结合起来。
    这所红专学校的师资问题，采用“能者为师、就地取材”的办法解决。全校共聘请教师四百二十人。党委、行政和共青团的干部是政治课教员；技术员、老工人、老农、老医师、先进生产者和先进工作者是技术课教员；文化课教员是聘请文化较高的干部、社员或职工担任，群众说：这些教师有生产本领，能解决实际问题。
    红专学校按照生产和工作的需要自编教材。编教材时，首先组织学员讨论，提出学习要求，再由教师和学员代表根据这些意见编写，请党委审查修订。学习时间和学习形式，都是按照学员们生产、工作情况灵活安排。农业专业一般是把小黑板带到田间、工地，组织学员在休息时学习；工业专业的学员们每晚在工厂里学习；医学、师范、社会服务等专业分别在每周集中学习两、三个夜晚，平时由学员自习，发现问题在集中学习时进行集体研究。
    红旗公社的红专学校是今年9月中旬开办的。在此以前，这个公社在青壮年中基本扫除了文盲。红专学校开办后，在各项生产和工作中起了相当大的作用，农学专业方面的学员普遍掌握了小麦、油菜等作物的先进种植技术，一些学员还创造了豌豆条播法，小麦条播开箱器、小麦盖箱板等先进技术和工具，提高工效四分之一到四倍。肥料厂学员在学习中试制成功八种肥料，一个月就制成肥料八十万斤，赶上了小春作物播种的需要。师范专业的学员中，有三十五个幼儿园教师原来毫无教学经验，经过边教边学，彼此交流经验，现在都会编制教案，有的还能编写诗歌作为幼儿教材。（附图片）
