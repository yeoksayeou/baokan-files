    New Farming System Growing
    By our reporters Deng Zichang and Zhang Hua
    On the plains of Hebei, a new type of farming system is budding and growing. This vigorous sapling is the large-scale high-yield movement centered on deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and less planting for greater harvest. Now, with the vigor of new life, it is taking root, sprouting, and growing leaves in the fertile soil. In November, we visited the vast fields south of the Great Wall. Here, whether in the mountainous areas or on the plains, whether in villages or fields, one could smell the fresh air and see novel scenery everywhere.
    The Seedling of the New Farming System
    In the late autumn fields, the green makeup has long been removed, only the newly unearthed wheat seedlings are a patch of green. In these wheat fields, if you look from a high place, the rows of wheat ridges are neat and tidy, like a pattern painting on the earth. Walking into the wheat field for a closer look, the black-green seedlings have already covered the ground, laying a thick blanket on the earth. These wheat seedlings are a finger taller and a shade darker than ordinary wheat fields. It is a high-yield experiment with less planting carried out by the people's communes by concentrating manpower and material resources. It is the seedling of a new farming system. With the people's commune movement, it has spread all over the fields of Hebei Province.
    We saw on both banks of the Zhang River in Shexian County, at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, clear flowing water and crisscrossing ditches in the river valley sandwiched between the high mountains. Wheat has already been planted in squares on this beach. Here, the ground is level and the ridges are straight, the rows are uniform, each wheat plot is three zhang long and five chi wide, neat and uniform in specifications, the ridges are connected, extending east and west for more than a hundred li. Here, archways with the words "Leap Forward" are erected on the road, red flags are flying in the fields, and wooden signs are inserted everywhere on the ground, with the area of the seedling fields and the yield per ear written on them... Groups of people are topdressing and watering in the wheat fields. This is the well-known "Hundred Li Ten Thousand Jin Wheat High-Yield River" in Shexian County.
    The people of Anguo County, who are famous throughout the country for their outstanding achievements in increasing production through intensive farming, have planted a total of 80,000 mu of large-scale high-yield wheat fields, including "Thousand Mu World's First Field," "Three Thousand Mu Universe's First Peak," and "Ten Thousand Mu Satellite Field." One plot occupies half a fen of land, and twenty plots make one mu. People who come here to visit don't need to ask about the number of mu, as long as you count how many plots there are, you can know the area of the high-yield field. Here, it is the birthplace of high-standard garden-style farming in the large-scale high-yield movement in Hebei Province. Every day, there are groups of people coming here to visit and learn. Some are from various communes in the province, and some are from other provinces. Some leave after looking, and some stay for visits. On the suggestion book of the Dongfeng People's Commune, there are also inscriptions by central responsible comrades such as Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Cai Chang, and Huang Kecheng: "Anguo's per-mu yield is a testimony today, Dongfeng is strong and suppresses the West Wind."
    The new farming system is also growing in areas with extensive farming. The Yongding River flood area used to be a typical example of the old farming system. In the past, wheat was planted here without plowing, without fertilizing, and after the floods, it was broadcast and mixed with other crops, only requiring a very low yield. Now, the cadres and masses of the seven communes in Wuqing County are creating a "Wheat Ten Thousand Jin High-Yield Depression" with an area of more than 100,000 mu in the flood area. These fields are deeply plowed to about one chi and two cun, and a large amount of base fertilizer is applied. Rows of windbreaks are also erected in the wheat fields. All the wheat fields have been irrigated with river water, the ground is wet, and the seedlings are a patch of dark green.
    All these changes will drag the old farming methods into a new situation. At present, in Hebei Province, there are many different names for large-scale high-yield wheat fields, such as "High-Yield River," "High-Yield Mu," "High-Yield Square," "High-Yield Road," "High-Yield Depression," and "High-Yield Sea," with tens of thousands of mu, thousands of mu, and hundreds of mu, which together account for a quarter of the province's total wheat fields. It is like a baby in the mother's womb, and will soon become a new body to replace the old farming system.
    New People Cultivate New Seedlings
    The new farming system must be cultivated by new people. In the fields of Hebei, such people have grown up. In late autumn and early winter, the river water is covered with ice flowers, but in some large-scale high-yield fields, there are still many battle sheds made of reeds and straw, where the professional teams for high-yield wheat eat and live. Those excellent high-yield wheat fields are exchanged for their unparalleled determination and perseverance. Let's take a look at how the Dongfeng People's Commune in Anguo County planted the Thousand Mu World's First Field. During the sowing days, more than 4,000 people did not leave the wheat field for twenty days and nights. With the determination of carpenters planing boards, they made the thousand mu of cultivated land into a flat "table." Then they deeply plowed the land, applied fertilizer in layers, and repeatedly stirred it seven times. Before sowing, they studied the specifications and requirements. Before sowing, they also conducted martial arts training to examine the density and uniformity of sowing. At the time of sowing, ropes were used to mark the rows, and seeds were weighed. Such careful planting, women compare it to embroidery.
    Less planting, planting well, high yield, and more harvest inspire people's enthusiasm. Everyone who participates in planting large-scale high-yield wheat fields can understand the benefits of the new system from different perspectives. Gao Fenghe, a 65-year-old commune member, had worked as a hired hand for landlords for most of his life before liberation. The landlords had hundreds of mu and thousands of qing, planting extensively and harvesting thinly. He was like an old donkey grinding, planting this piece and planting that piece, so tired that his back ached. Now, less planting and more harvesting is right to his heart. So he underreported his age by ten years, avoiding the leadership's care (actually, the leadership's wish to take care of the elderly), and was kept in the professional team for high-yield fields. In order to realize his ideal, he resolutely joined the youth commando team, wanting to compete with Luo Cheng and others. No matter what kind of work, he always did it ahead of the people. The commune selected labor models three times, and he won the first-class model twice. The cadres and masses of Anxiang Village in Gaocheng County raised their hands to express their support for the new system of less planting, planting well, high yield, and more harvest. This village has a lot of land and cannot plant it all. During the leap forward movement last year, it was once criticized and given five black flags. They felt that Chairman Mao had seen through their hearts and were particularly active in implementing the new farming system and carrying out the large-scale high-yield movement.
    People have also transformed and improved themselves in the large-scale high-yield movement. When Shexian County was brewing the "Hundred Li Ten Thousand Jin Wheat High-Yield River" at the three-level cadre meeting, He Dawang, the production team leader of Hekou Village, Xida Commune, once believed that the mountainous area had many stones, thin soil, and cold climate, and there were no conditions for large-scale ten-thousand-jin wheat. In the big debates, the cadres and masses questioned him: your village's field management is not very good, why does the corn yield per mu reach 1,200 jin? By presenting the facts and reasoning, his thinking was enlightened, and he immediately wrote a big-character poster to examine his conservative thinking. After returning to the village, he led the team members to select plots and deeply plow the land.
    New People, New Style
    Only a new leadership style can establish a new farming system. Countless large-scale high-yield wheat fields are new flowers blooming from the art of leadership. In the past, some cadres looked at reports and issued instructions in the office. Later, the style changed, and they went to the fields to plant experimental fields and lead production with production. Now, many party and government leading cadres who lead large-scale high-yield fields have moved to the fields to eat and live, serving as production team leaders and commanders-in-chief of large areas of high-yield fields, taking charge in the fields, responsible for planting and harvesting. On the day we visited the "Wheat High-Yield Depression" in the Yongding River flood area, we saw Comrade Li Lianyin, a member of the Wuqing County Party Committee and Deputy County Governor, transplanting seedlings with the professional team members. Later, we learned that Deputy County Governor Li was in charge of the leadership work of the "High-Yield Depression" headquarters, and had lived here for more than three months, busy from morning to night, holding meetings at the head of the field and participating in production. To find him to talk about problems, it is best to go to the wheat field. On November 9, we met Comrade Li Zhihong, Secretary of the Xingtai County Party Committee, in the large-scale high-yield wheat fields of the Beiwang People's Commune in Xingtai County. He was working in his wheat experimental field. This experimental field has an area of ​​160 mu. In addition to most of the large-scale high-yield experiments, various comparative experiments were also carried out, with more than 50 projects. He introduced to us that Xingtai County has better wheat planting technology. Precisely because of this, conservative thinking is more serious. According to the old habits of the past, spring water and topdressing were only applied here during the Qingming Festival. At this time, the wheat just began to joint, resulting in long and fine lower stalks. When it came to heading and filling, the better the wheat, the easier it was to lodge. In order to solve this problem, the county party committee had repeatedly promoted early irrigation of spring water, but it never worked. This year, the number of high-yield wheat fields has increased, and it can no longer be delayed. Therefore, the county party committee decided that the county party committee members who took charge in the fields should each run an experimental field in a large area of high-yield wheat fields, making various comparative experiments on fertilization, watering, varieties, and dense planting, exploring their own experience, and proposing models to educate the masses. These situations show that the cadres of the leading organs are working hard to improve themselves in order to be good flag bearers in reforming the farming system.

    新的耕作制度在成长
    本报记者邓子常  张华
    在河北平原上，新型的耕作制度正在萌芽成长。这颗茁壮的幼芽，就是以深耕细作、少种多收为中心的大面积高额丰产运动。现在，它正以新生的朝气，在肥沃的泥壤中扎根、发芽和生叶。11月份，我们曾访问了长城以南的广阔原野。在这里，不管是山区平原，无论村落田野，到处都能嗅到清鲜的气息，看到新颖的景色。
    新耕作制的幼芽
    晚秋的原野，绿妆早已脱掉，只有新出土的麦苗，却是一片碧绿。在这些麦田里，如果你登高远望，排行并格的麦垅齐齐整整，真像是大地上的图案画。走进麦田细看，黑绿的苗子，早已罩满了地皮，给大地铺起厚厚的绒毯。这些麦田，苗儿比普通麦田的高一指、深一色。它是人民公社集中人力、物力进行的少种高产试验，是新耕作制度的幼芽。它随着人民公社化运动，已经布满了河北省的原野。
    我们在太行山东麓涉县境内的漳河两岸看到，高山夹峙着的河谷里，流水清清，沟渠交错。在这滩地上，已经种起一方一方的小麦。这里地平垅直、行垅匀称，每个麦畦长三丈、宽五尺，横竖整齐，规格划一，畦垅相接，东西绵延百余里。在这里，路上搭了跃进牌坊，地里红旗飘扬，地头遍插木牌，牌上写着苗田面积，株穗产量……。一伙伙的人群正在麦田里追肥、浇水。这就是当地闻名的涉县的“百里万斤小麦丰产川”。
    以精耕细作增产突出而著名全国的安国县人民，播种了“千亩天下第一田”、“三千亩宇宙第一峰”、“万亩卫星田”等共达八万亩的大块高额丰产麦田。一个畦占半分地，二十个畦成一亩。来这里参观的人不用打问亩数，只要你数数多少畦，就能知道丰产田的面积。这里，是河北省大面积高额丰产运动中高标准园田化耕作的发祥地，每天都有来这里参观访问的人群。其中有省内各社的，也有外省的，有的看看就走，有的住着访问。在东风人民公社的意见本上，还留着陈毅、李富春、蔡畅、黄克诚等中央负责同志的题词：“安国亩产今作证，东风强大压西风”。
    新的耕作制度也生长在耕作粗放的地区。永定河泛区，曾是旧耕作制度的典型。过去这里种麦不翻地，不施肥，洪水过后，撒播混种，只要求很低的收成。现在，武清县的七个公社的干部群众，却在泛区搞起一片面积达十万多亩的“小麦万斤丰产洼”。这些地深翻一尺二寸左右，并且施用了大量底肥。麦田当中还架起了一排排的风障。全部麦田已浇灌了河水，地里湿漉漉的，苗儿一片黑绿。
    所有这些变革，将把旧有的耕作方式拖进一个新的境地。目前河北省许许多多的“丰产川”、“丰产亩”、“丰产方”、“丰产路”、“丰产洼”、“丰产海”等不同名目的大面积高额丰产麦田，几万亩几千亩几百亩的，总合起来已占到了全省总麦田的四分之一。它正像母亲胎胞中的婴儿，不久就会变成新的主体，来接替旧的耕作制度。
    新人培育新幼芽
    新的耕作制度，必须有新型的人来培育。在河北的田野上，这样的人已经成长起来了。秋末冬初，河水结了冰花，但在一些大面积的高额丰产田里，仍然屹立着许多用苇子稻草搭成的战棚，丰产麦的专业队员们，就吃住在这里。那些出色的丰产麦田，就是他们用无比的决心和毅力换来的。请来看看安国县东风人民公社千亩天下第一田是怎样种植的吧，在那播种的日子里，四千多人，二十个日夜没离麦地。他们用木匠刨板面的决心，把千亩耕地作成了一方平整的“桌台”。然后又深翻地，分层施肥，反复捣弄七次。播种前研究规格要求。临播种还进行比武练兵，考查撒种的疏密匀适。到播种的时候，又用绳子划行，过秤量种。这样精心的种植，妇女把它比作是绣花。
    少种、种好、高产、多收，鼓舞着人们的干劲。参加种植大面积高额丰产麦田的每一个人，都能从不同的角度，来领会认识新制度的好处。六十五岁的社员高凤和，解放以前给地主扛了多半辈子长活。地主们百亩千顷，广种薄收，他就像老驴拉磨，种了这块种那块，直累得腰酸腿疼。现在要少种多收，正对他的心坎。所以他才少报了十岁年龄，躲过领导上的照顾（实际是领导照顾老人的心愿），被留在了丰产田的专业队。为实现自己的理想，他坚决参加了青年突击队，要和罗成们比高低。无论什么活他都干在人们的前头，公社三次评选劳模，他两次都争得了头等模范。藁城县安乡村的干部群众，对少种、种好、高产、多收的新制度，举起双手表示拥护。这个村土地多，种不过来，去年跃进运动中，有一次评比，就扛了五面黑旗。他们感到毛主席看透了他们的心，对实行新的耕作制度，搞大面积高额丰产运动格外积极。
    人们在大面积高额丰产运动中，也改造提高了自己。涉县在三级干部会议上酝酿“百里万斤小麦丰产川”的时候，西达公社河口村生产队长贺大旺，就曾经认为山区石多、土薄、气候冷，没条件搞大面积的万斤麦。在大鸣大放大辩论当中，干部群众质问他：你村的田间管理还不大好，为什么玉米亩产达到一千二百斤？摆事实讲道理，帮助他的思想开了窍，当场就写大字报，检查保守思想。回村后就领导队员选地块，深翻地。
    新人新风格
    只有新的领导风格，才能树立起新的耕作制度，无数大面积丰产麦田，都是领导艺术开放出来的新花朵。过去，有些干部是在办公室看报告，发指示，后来作风改变了，下地去种试验田，以生产领导生产。现在，许多领导大面积高额丰产田的党政领导干部，都搬到田里去吃、去住，担任生产队长和大片丰产田的总指挥，挂帅到田，包种包收。我们到永定河泛区“小麦丰产洼”参观的那天，就亲眼看到中共武清县县委委员、副县长李联荫同志正在和专业队员们在一起移苗补苗。后来一问才知道，李副县长担任“丰产洼”指挥部的领导工作，已在这里住了三个多月，每天从早忙到夜，地头开会，参加生产。要找他谈问题，最好是到麦田里。11月9日，我们在邢台县北旺人民公社的大片丰产麦田里，碰到了中共邢台县县委书记李志宏同志，他正在他的小麦试验场上劳动。这个试验场有一百六十亩的面积，除多数大面积高额丰产试验外，还作了各种各样的对比试验，项目有五十多个。他向我们介绍，邢台县种麦技术较好，正因为这样，保守思想也比较严重。按照过去的老习惯，这里清明才浇春水、上追肥，这时小麦刚开始拔节，结果麦棵下部秆细节长，等到抽穗灌浆时，越是好麦子就越容易倒伏。为解决这个问题，县委曾多次推行提早灌春水，但始终行不通。今年丰产麦田增多了，不能再拖着不解决。因此县委会便决定挂帅到田的县委委员，每人在大片丰产麦田里搞一个试验场，作施肥、浇水、品种、密植等各种对比试验，自己摸索经验，提出样板，教育群众。这些情况说明，领导机关的干部，为当好改革耕作制度的旗手，正努力提高自己。
