    Sea Heroes
    On August 24th, during the battle on the Fujian front to punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops, a certain torpedo boat unit of our navy, with the cooperation of fraternal units, launched a heroic attack on the Chiang Kai-shek military vessels heading towards Kinmen. The torpedo boats bravely approached the enemy vessels, launched torpedoes, sinking the Chiang Kai-shek's "Taisheng" ship of the Zhongzi class and damaging the "Zhonghai" ship.
    As the flotilla completed its attack and withdrew from the battle zone, torpedo boat No. XX suddenly caught fire after being hit, and its steering gear malfunctioned, causing seawater to rapidly flood the cabins. At this critical moment, all the officers and soldiers on board made a desperate rescue effort, but it was ultimately unsuccessful due to the severe damage to the boat.
    The seawater was about to completely engulf the boat. Political Instructor Zhou Fangshun and other comrades calmly lowered the national flag from the mast, tucked it in their arms, and then jumped into the sea one after another. They agreed to stay together in life and death, take care of each other, and swim back to the mainland.
    It was already dark. Six heroic naval fighters were swimming in the sea. They were Communist Party member and Political Instructor Zhou Fangshun, Petty Officer Ji Deshan, Engine Squad Leader Li Maoqin, Communist Youth League member and Torpedo Officer You Zhimin, Engine Soldier Huang Zhongyi, and Gunner Zhao Qingfu.
    Initially, all six of them were swimming together, but soon they were scattered by the waves.
    In the vast sea, Li Maoqin and You Zhimin swam together. Throughout the night, they remained optimistic, swam well, and were full of confidence. You Zhimin said to Li Maoqin, "We must maintain good contact, swim towards the moon, that's the mainland. When the moon sets, we'll swim towards the cluster of stars next to the moon. As long as we don't lose direction, we'll definitely be able to swim back. If we encounter enemy ships, we'll throw away our life jackets and sink ourselves."
    They took care of each other, enduring the pain of hunger, thirst, and cold, swimming throughout the night. At dawn on the 25th, You Zhimin finally became too exhausted to swim any further. He said to Li Maoqin, "I can't go on anymore, you go back!" Li Maoqin was also exhausted, but he couldn't abandon his comrade, so he encouraged You Zhimin while struggling to pull him along, swimming tenaciously. At that moment, he spotted three figures and quickly recognized them as comrades who had jumped into the sea together.
    It turned out that Zhou Fangshun, Ji Deshan, and Zhao Qingfu had been swimming together since they went into the water, encouraging each other. Zhao Qingfu said, "If we swim to the enemy's island, it won't be a big deal, we can launch a sneak attack, at worst, we'll take out two of them for one of us. If we encounter sharks, that'll be bad." Zhou Fangshun said, "There are no sharks here this season, swim with confidence!" They swam throughout the night. At dawn the next day, three enemy warships sailed by. They resolved that if they were discovered by the enemy, they would untie their life jackets and drown themselves. However, the enemy ships, fleeing in a hurry towards Taiwan, did not spot them. They continued swimming forward, suddenly spotting a black dot, which turned out to be Ji Deshan struggling with the seawater, pulling along the weak You Zhimin. Thus, the five of them reunited.
    Now, let's talk about the whereabouts of Engine Soldier Huang Zhongyi. At the beginning of the jump, he was still swimming with everyone. As he swam, he asked the other comrades, "Did we hit the enemy ships?" Because he was in the engine room during the battle and didn't see what was happening outside. The comrades told him, "We destroyed two enemy warships." He happily said, "That's worth it, that's worth it." Soon, a wave washed him away. He swam alone, and a day and a night passed without seeing the mainland. He was tired, hungry, and sleepy. He ordered himself to swim back. But he had no strength, and soon he drifted and fell unconscious in the sea. When he woke up, he found himself on a fishing boat in Chongwu County, Fujian. He had been rescued.
    Zhou Fangshun, You Zhimin, Ji Deshan, Li Maoqin, and Zhao Qingfu were still swimming tenaciously in the sea. The next day at noon, after more than twenty hours of fighting the sea, a lonely island appeared in front of them. By this time, they were all hungry, tired, sleepy, and thirsty, extremely exhausted. Seeing this small island close to the mainland, they swam even harder, wanting to go ashore and rest for a while. Who knew that not only could they not swim up to it, but they were actually swimming further and further away from the island. It turned out that it was low tide. The seawater swept them back into the sea.
    However, they did not lose faith, but continued to tenaciously use all their strength to swim back to the mainland. They would swim for a while and then rest. After the reunion, You Zhimin's spirits rose again, but his strength was exhausted and he couldn't swim. Ji Deshan then took Li Maoqin's place and pulled him along. Later, You Zhimin became ill again, suffering unbearable stomach pains, feeling cold all over, and shivering constantly. To alleviate his comrade's pain, Ji Deshan, although very tired, still untied his life jacket, hugged You Zhimin, and used his own body temperature to warm him. They swam like this until dark. You Zhimin's body was still cold, and his stomach pain had not improved. Ji Deshan was also extremely exhausted. Suddenly, a big wave washed them apart. Zhao Qingfu immediately swam over to replace Ji Deshan and hugged You Zhimin to swim. They were determined to bring You Zhimin back. However, You Zhimin's condition did not improve. He said to the political instructor, "I really can't go on anymore, I can't drag everyone down any longer. I have two hundred and forty yuan saved up, please take forty yuan to pay the League dues, and send the rest to my mother, please write a letter to comfort my mother. I will die happily..."
    At dawn on the 26th, when the sun rose from the east, Zhou Fangshun was the first to discover that he was no longer in the sea, but in a warm cabin.
    It turned out that after their boat sank, the frontline command mobilized all rescue forces, including fishermen, and had been searching for them. After they had fought the sea for a day and two nights, and were so exhausted that they were in a state of unconsciousness, they were finally found and rescued by the fishermen. However, the young Communist Youth League member You Zhimin could never return. He dedicated his glorious life to his country and people.
    Not long ago, the frontline naval units held a celebration meeting. Zhou Fangshun and the other five comrades were each awarded a first-class merit for bravely rushing towards the enemy ships during the battle and completing the attack mission; and for the courageous rescue efforts by all the officers and soldiers after the boat was hit and injured, demonstrating the heroic spirit of revolutionary fighters. After going into the sea, they fought the sea for thirty-six hours, overcoming fatigue, hunger, thirst, and cold with tenacious revolutionary will, helping and encouraging each other, and demonstrating a high degree of unity, mutual assistance, and class friendship. The frontline units awarded each of them a first-class merit. When facing danger, Communist Youth League member You Zhimin first thought not of himself, but of the Communist Youth League organization, fully demonstrating the heroic character of a people's fighter. The frontline unit's Party committee posthumously recognized him as a glorious Communist Party member. The high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism of these six individuals inspires naval officers and soldiers to fight for the final recovery of Taiwan.

    海上英雄
    8月24日，在福建前线惩罚蒋军的战斗中，我海军某鱼雷快艇部队在兄弟部队配合下，对开向金门的蒋军军舰进行了英勇攻击。快艇勇敢地驶近敌舰，施放鱼雷，击沉了蒋军中字号“台生舰”一艘，击伤了“中海舰”一艘。
    当艇队攻击完毕撤出战区时，某号鱼雷快艇突然中弹起火，舵机失灵，海水迅速涌进舱室。这时，全艇官兵进行了紧张的抢救，但终因艇身受伤太重，抢救无效。
    海水很快就要完全吞没全艇了。指导员周方顺等同志镇定地把国旗从桅杆上降了下来，揣在怀里，然后相继跳入海中。他们相约要生死在一起，互相照顾，一定要游回大陆。
    天已经黑了。六个英勇的海军战士在大海上游着。他们是共产党员、政治指导员周方顺，水手长季德山，轮机班长李茂勤，共青团员、鱼雷业务长尤志民，轮机兵黄忠义，枪炮兵赵庆福。
    开始，他们六个人还是在一起游，但是不一会儿，就被海浪冲散了。
    在茫茫的大海里，李茂勤和尤志民游在一起。这一夜，他们始终很乐观，游的很好，信心很足。尤志民对李茂勤说：“咱们两人要好好保持联系，对准月亮游，就是大陆；月亮落了，咱们就对准月亮旁边的那堆星星游，只要不迷失方向，就一定能游回去。碰上敌舰，咱们就扔掉救生衣，自己沉下去”。
    他俩互相照顾着，忍受着饥渴、寒冷的痛苦，整整游了一夜。25日拂晓，尤志民终于疲乏到再也游不动了。他对李茂勤说：“我不行了，你回去吧！”李茂勤也没有力气了，但他不能丢下战友不管，于是一面鼓励尤志民，一面费力地拉着他，顽强地游着。这时，他发现了三个人影，很快就认出了这是一起跳入海里的战友。
    原来周方顺、季德山、赵庆福等三个人下水后，始终游在一起，并且互相鼓励。赵庆福说：“咱们要是游到敌人的岛上关系不大，咱们可以偷袭他一下，最坏来个一换俩。要是遇见鲨鱼就不好办了”。周方顺说：“这季节这里没有鲨鱼，放心大胆游吧！”他们整整游了一夜。第二天拂晓，三只敌人的军舰驶过来。他们下定决心，如被敌人发现，就解开救生衣自沉。但是，仓皇向台湾方向逃跑的敌舰并没有发现他们。他们继续向前游着，忽然发现了一个黑点，原来这正是季德山拉着混身无力的尤志民同海水搏斗。于是，五个人会合了。
    现在应该谈一下轮机兵黄忠义的下落。在跳水开初时，他和大家还游在一起。他边游边问别的同志：“咱们打中了敌舰没有？”因为战斗时他在机舱内，没有看见外面的情形。同志们告诉他：“揍毁了敌人的两条兵舰”。他高兴地说：“上算，上算”。不久，一个海浪把他冲开了。他单独地游着，一天一夜过去了，还不见大陆。他又累、又饿、又困。他命令自己一定要游回去。但是他没有力气了，不久就在海上飘着昏睡过去。当他醒来时，发现自己已经是在福建崇武县的一个渔船上，他被救起来了。
    周方顺、尤志民、季德山、李茂勤、赵庆福五人，仍然在海上顽强地游着。第二天中午，也就是他们在海上搏斗了二十多个小时后，在前面出现了一个孤零零的小岛。这时，他们已经是又饿、又累、又困、又渴，疲劳极了。看见这个接近大陆的小岛，又都用力地游，想上去休息一会。谁知道，不但游不上去，反而越游离小岛越远。原来正赶上退潮。海水又把他们卷入了大海。
    但是，他们并没有失去信心，仍然顽强地用尽一切力量重新向大陆游。游一会，休息一会。尤志民在会合以后，情绪又高涨起来，但他的力量已经用尽，游不动了。季德山就代替李茂勤拉着他游。后来，尤志民又病了，肚疼难忍，浑身发冷，不停地发抖。为了减轻战友的痛苦，季德山虽然很疲乏了，但仍然解开救生衣，抱着尤志民，用自己的体温替他暖身子。这样，他们一直游到天黑。尤志民的身体仍然冰冷，肚疼也没有好转。而季德山也疲乏极了。忽然一个大浪，把他俩冲开了。赵庆福马上游过去代替季德山抱着尤志民游。他们立志要把尤志民带回来。但是，尤志民的病情仍未减轻，他对指导员说：“我实在不行了，不能再拖累大家了。我存有二百四十元，请拿出四十元交团费，其余寄给我的母亲，请你写信安慰一下我母亲。我会愉快地……”
    26日拂晓，当太阳从东方升起的时候，周方顺首先发现了自己已经不在大海里，而是在一个温暖的船舱里。
    原来当他们的艇沉后，前线指挥部就动员了所有救生力量包括渔民在内，一直在寻找。当他们同大海搏斗了一天两夜，已经疲乏到昏睡状态的时候，终于被渔民找到救起来了。但是，年轻的共青团员尤志民却永远不能回来了。他为自己的祖国和人民，献出了光辉的生命。
    不久之前，前线海军部队举行了庆功大会。周方顺等六个同志因为在战时勇敢冲向敌舰，完成了攻击任务；艇中弹受伤后，全艇官兵又奋勇抢救，表现了革命战士的英雄气概。他们下海后，在大海中搏斗了三十六个小时，以顽强的革命意志战胜了疲劳、饥渴、寒冷，互相帮助，互相鼓励，发扬了高度的团结互助和阶级友爱精神。前线部队给他们六人各记一等功一次。共青团员尤志民在临危时首先想到的不是个人，而是共青团组织，充分表现了人民战士的英雄本色。前线部队党委追认他为光荣的共产党员。他们六个人的高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神，鼓舞着海军官兵为最后收复台湾而奋斗。
