Concerning the Question of People's Livelihood

(This newspaper reports) The regulations of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on doing a good job in several aspects of the current people's livelihood and the approval from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The Approval from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

The regulations of the Hubei Provincial Committee on doing a good job in several aspects of the current people's livelihood are very well written. These regulations have grasped an aspect that is easily overlooked in the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, and this aspect is also very important. Production and livelihood must be grasped simultaneously. It is difficult to do a good job in production if livelihood is not addressed. We must improve people's lives on the basis of doing a good job in production, rather than one-sidedly emphasizing livelihood while being divorced from the foundation of production. We must improve people's lives in accordance with the spirit of diligence and frugality, rather than promoting extravagance and waste. The purpose of improving people's lives is to promote greater development in production, not to hinder it. We must do a good job in both production and livelihood, so that workers can eat well, sleep well, and raise their children well, so that they are full of energy, in good spirits, and use greater enthusiasm to ensure a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The Central Committee believes that the Party committees of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions can follow the example of the Hubei Provincial Committee and formulate their own regulations based on local conditions and announce their implementation. In ethnic minority areas, the customs and habits of ethnic minorities should be respected in order to do a good job in the livelihood of the local people.
							The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, December 19, 1958

The Regulations of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on Doing a Good Job in Several Aspects of the Current People's Livelihood

The fundamental purpose of developing production is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. We must gradually improve people's lives on the basis of continuous development of production. Some farmers say it well: "Life is getting more and more interesting, and production is getting more and more energetic." We must do a good job in both production and livelihood. The task of the Party is to comprehensively grasp ideology, production, and livelihood, and to care for people. In the situation of the Great Leap Forward, we must care for people even more. This means that the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care for the lives of the masses. It is difficult to do a good job in production without addressing livelihood. Good production, good livelihood, and well-raised children, this is our slogan. Based on the repeated instructions of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Provincial Committee puts forward a major task to all Party organizations in the province: to strive to do a good job in several aspects of the current people's livelihood. The purpose is not to dampen spirits, but to boost morale; not to hinder, but to promote; not to make next year's industrial and agricultural production only a small leap forward, but to make next year's industrial and agricultural production a greater leap forward than this year. To this end, the following regulations are made, requiring Party committees at all levels to formulate practical and feasible specific implementation plans based on local conditions to ensure implementation.

I. Combine Labor and Rest Rhythmically

Resting well is for laboring even better. Whether the enthusiasm is sufficient depends not on the length of working hours, but on the magnitude of the labor effect. The better the rest, the more energetic the work, and the greater the labor effect. Conversely, if the rest is not good, there is no energy to work, and the labor effect is small. People who don't rest well cannot work better. Local committees and county committees should conscientiously summarize the experiences and lessons in this regard.

First, laborers must have sufficient sleep time, rest time, and a certain amount of cultural and recreational time. Eight hours of sleep, four hours for eating and resting, a total of twelve hours, must be guaranteed every day. Under normal circumstances, work eight hours a day, study two hours a day, and when busy, work ten hours a day, but never exceed twelve hours at the busiest.

Second, do a good job in tool reform, improve labor organization, gradually reduce heavy physical labor, and improve labor efficiency.

Third, ensure that members of rural people's communes have half a day off each week.

Fourth, ensure that female laborers do not do heavy work, do not work in cold water, and do not stay up late during their menstrual periods.

Fifth, ensure production safety, improve working conditions as much as possible, and strive to reduce and avoid work-related injuries.

II. Run Public Dining Halls Well

The public dining hall is the center of collective life and welfare undertakings. Whether it is run well is directly related to everyone who eats in the public dining hall. If it is run well, the public dining hall can be consolidated. If it is not run well, the public dining hall may collapse. What counts as running it well? It is to ensure that everyone eats their fill and eats well, so that everyone who eats in the dining hall feels better than eating at home.

First, eat your fill. Whether it is a grain-producing area or a non-grain-producing area, whether it is a bumper harvest area or a poor harvest area, whether it is an area that has implemented a grain supply system or an area that has not implemented a grain supply system, the public dining hall must provide enough to eat, no matter how much anyone can eat.

Second, eat well. The food should be diverse and flavorful. There should be vegetables, soup, meat, vegetables, dry rice, porridge, and boiled water, so as to satisfy everyone as much as possible.

Third, eat cleanly and hygienically. The dining hall and cooking utensils should be kept clean at all times. Used bowls, chopsticks, spoons, etc. should be disinfected with boiling water. People with infectious diseases should eat separately or be allowed to take their food home to eat.

Fourth, the public dining hall should have a restaurant. The public dining hall can be attached to a small shop, selling meat dishes, snacks, cigarettes, alcohol, and daily necessities. There should be a vegetable garden, a sauce garden, a pig farm, a tofu workshop, a noodle workshop, pickled vegetables, pickled cabbage, pickled fish, pickled meat, etc.

Fifth, the public dining hall should achieve democratic management. Dining hall managers and cooks should be elected by the masses. Appropriate rewards should be given to outstanding managers and cooks who are recognized by the masses for their great work achievements. Help dining hall managers and cooks improve their awareness. Educate all commune members to regard running the dining hall as a noble work of serving the people. Dining hall staff and people eating in the dining hall should have a friendly attitude, unite and help each other, and work together to improve work and prevent waste. People eating in the dining hall have the obligation to take turns "helping in the kitchen" so that the dining hall staff has adequate rest time. Simplify the procedures for serving food and provide as much convenience as possible to people eating in the dining hall.

Sixth, in accordance with the principle of "large collective, small freedom," necessary flexibility should be allowed for people eating in the dining hall. For example, patients, the elderly, children, pregnant women, etc. can take their food home to eat. In cold weather, households living far away are allowed to take their food home to eat or cook at home. Each household can have a small stove, and a portion of firewood, grass, and coarse bran should be distributed to each household so that they can burn stoves (i.e., hand warmers), boil water, stir-fry rice, and stir-fry vegetables in winter. Each household should also be allowed to raise pigs, raise chickens, and pickle fish, pickle meat, pickle vegetables, etc.

Seventh, do a good job in the construction site dining hall and ensure that people working on the construction site eat their fill and eat well.

Eighth, the number of people eating in the dining hall and the number of dining hall staff should currently be twenty to one, or twenty-five to one. Among the dining hall staff, there should be both full laborers and half laborers. It is also necessary to reform cooking tools as much as possible to reduce and improve cooking labor and improve efficiency.

Ninth, commune members eating in the public dining hall can bring guests to eat in the dining hall, and the dining hall does not add extra dishes to entertain them. The dining hall provides convenience within its capabilities for individuals who add dishes themselves for guests.

Tenth, cook training classes should be held in batches so that all dining hall cooks can continuously improve their cooking skills, increase hygiene knowledge, and develop a spirit of loving dining hall work.

Eleventh, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are not allowed to hold any positions in the public dining hall. Educate the masses to improve their revolutionary vigilance and strictly prevent enemies from carrying out sabotage activities in the public dining hall. If such criminals are found, arrest them and bring them to justice immediately.

Twelfth, establish dining halls by production team. Since the number of people in the production team is too large and it is not easy to run the meals well, the method of setting up separate meals can be adopted under unified management, and several restaurants can be set up as needed.

III. Housing Problems

First, each commune should have one to several construction teams. On construction sites, there must be work sheds that can shelter from wind and snow. The houses demolished for accumulating fertilizer should be repaired as soon as possible. The repaired houses should separate people and livestock. Attention should also be paid to repairing livestock pens to facilitate wintering.

Second, each commune should check the houses one by one and do a good job in the cold protection work for the houses in time.

Third, county committees and people's commune party committees should make collective new village plans while carrying out urban planning and land planning; and do a good job in pilot projects to set an example in terms of new village scale, house style, landscaping, hygiene, and the construction of threshing grounds, roads, cemeteries, toilets, and livestock pens. Strive for the people's communes in rural areas throughout the province to complete the construction of collective new villages in batches in the next few years. The new houses should be easy for families of men, women, old and young to reunite.

IV. Caring for the Elderly and Women and Children

First, run nursing homes well so that the elderly who are helpless can be cared for in their old age.

Second, run nurseries and kindergartens well. Select young and middle-aged women who are healthy, clean, and love children to serve as nursery and kindergarten caregivers. Hold caregiver training classes in batches to improve their professional knowledge and work enthusiasm. Educate all commune members to regard the work of caring for children as a noble work of serving the people. Do not send people with infectious diseases to serve as caregivers. Women's federations at all levels should do their best to do this work well.

Third, in addition to equal pay for equal work and taking care of women's menstrual hygiene, women must also be patiently helped to learn culture and technology. Pregnant women, lying-in women, and breastfeeding mothers should be properly taken care of, and delivery rooms should be set up according to specific circumstances.

V. Doing a Good Job in Hygiene Work

First, towns and villages throughout the province should learn from Shashi, a model city in hygiene work, mobilize the masses to revise the work plan for eliminating five pests (flies, mosquitoes, rats, sparrows, snails), eliminating five diseases (schistosomiasis, malaria, current syphilis, hookworm disease, filariasis), and promoting hygiene, and take action quickly to strive to basically eliminate five pests and eliminate five diseases in one or two years.

Second, improve medical institutions (such as the central health center of the people's commune, the branch of the brigade, the health station and health room below the branch, etc.), do a good job in medical work, simplify medical procedures, and provide patients with various conveniences as much as possible.

Third, do a good job in public bathhouses. Those who are unwilling to bathe in public bathhouses are allowed to take the bathwater back to bathe.

Fourth, do a good job in the cleanliness and hygiene of all houses and all public places.

VI. Actively Carry Out Mass Cultural and Recreational and Sports Activities

First, in the intervals of intense labor, cadres leading singing and dancing is a good rest and a good opportunity to carry out propaganda and mobilization work. Party committees at all levels should mobilize the masses to do a good job in cultural and recreational activities in the fields and on construction sites.

Second, during the Spring Festival in 1959, large-scale cultural and sports activities should be carried out to allow all workers to have a good time, carry out a large-scale cultural and sports movement, hold performances, hold sports meetings, and at the same time, do a good job in propaganda and mobilization work in current affairs and policies.

Third, actively cultivate small drama troupes in factories and rural areas that are self-compiled, self-directed, and self-acted without leaving production, and pay attention to helping them gradually improve their political level and cultural and artistic level in a planned way.

Fourth, combine mass sports activities with militia military training to do a good job in national defense sports.

To ensure the victorious completion of the above tasks, the key lies in the leadership of Party organizations at all levels.

First, the Provincial Committee will soon establish a Life and Welfare Committee, under the leadership of the Provincial Committee's Rural Work Department, to organize relevant provincial departments to jointly strengthen the leadership of life and welfare work throughout the province. The Provincial Committee has designated Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Provincial Committee Secretariat, to be in charge of this work. Local committees, county committees, and people's commune party committees should immediately establish life and welfare departments. Among the deputy secretaries, deputy commissioners, deputy county heads of party committees at all levels and the deputy directors of people's communes, there should be one person in charge of life and welfare work.

Second, all life and welfare work should be done well, and the spirit of running life and welfare undertakings diligently and frugally should be conscientiously implemented, adapting to local conditions, doing what is possible, saving manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and preventing extravagance and waste.

Third, the Party committees at all levels are responsible for running a dining hall, a nursery, and a nursing home in person, in order to summarize experiences and promote them in time. Regular inspections and evaluations should be carried out, and red flag competitions should be launched. To do a good job in several aspects of the current people's livelihood, we must put politics in command and boldly mobilize the masses. We must improve the political awareness of the masses, boost greater enthusiasm, and promote a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various tasks in the process of doing these tasks well.

Fourth, these regulations apply to rural areas and, in principle, also to cities. Wuhan City, Huangshi City, and local committees and municipal party committees can refer to these regulations to put forward specific regulations for doing a good job in the people's livelihood in cities and report them to the Provincial Committee for approval and implementation.

    关于人民生活问题
    本报讯  中共湖北省委关于做好当前人民生活的几项工作的规定和中共中央的批语。
    中共中央的批语
    湖北省委关于做好当前人民生活的几项工作的规定，写得很好。这个规定抓住了工业、农业生产大跃进当中容易被人忽视的一个方面，而这个方面也是十分重要的。生产和生活两方面，必须同时抓起来。不抓生活，要搞好生产是困难的。要在搞好生产的基础上搞好生活，而不是脱离生产基础的片面强调生活。要根据勤俭节约的精神搞好生活，而不是提倡铺张浪费。搞好生活的目的，是促进生产更大的发展，而不是促退。一定要既搞好生产，又搞好生活，使劳动者吃好饭、睡好觉、带好孩子，使他们精神饱满，心情舒畅，用更大的热情来保证工业、农业生产更大的跃进。中央认为，各省、市、自治区党委都可照湖北省委那样，根据当地的条件，做出自己的规定，公布实行。在少数民族地区，应该尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，来做好当地人民生活的工作。
                                   中共中央  1958年12月19日
    中共湖北省委关于做好当前人民生活的几项工作的规定
    发展生产的根本目的是最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化生活的需要。要在生产不断发展的基础上，逐步改善人民的生活。有些农民说得好：“生活越过越有味，生产越干越有劲。”要在搞好生产的同时搞好生活。党的任务就是要全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，就是要关心人。在大跃进的形势下，更要关心人。这就是说，群众的干劲越大，党越是要关心群众生活。不抓生活，要搞好生产是困难的。生产好，生活好，孩子带的好，这是我们的口号。省委根据中央和毛泽东同志的多次指示，向全省党组织提出一个重大任务：要努力做好有关当前人民生活的几项工作。其目的，不是泄气，而是鼓气；不是促退，而是促进；不是要使明年的工农业生产只有一个小小的跃进，而是要使明年的工农业生产来一个比今年更大的跃进。为此，作如下规定，要求各级党委，根据当地的具体情况，定出切实可行的具体实施方案，保证执行。一、把劳动和休息有节奏地结合起来
    休息好，是为了劳动得更好。看干劲足不足，不在于劳动时间的长短，而在于劳动效果的大小。休息得越好，干的劲头越足，劳动的效果越大。反之，休息得不好，干起来没有精神，劳动的效果就小。休息得不好的人，不可能劳动得更好。各地委、各县委要认真总结这方面的经验教训。
    第一、要使劳动者有足够的睡眠时间、休息时间和一定的文化娱乐时间。每天睡眠八小时，吃饭、休息四小时，共十二小时，必须保证。在一般情况下，每天工作八小时，学习二小时，忙时每天工作十小时，最忙也不可超过十二小时。
    第二、搞好工具改革，改善劳动组织，逐步减轻繁重的体力劳动，提高劳动效率。
    第三、保证农村的人民公社社员每周休息半天。
    第四、保证妇女劳动者月经期内不做重活，不下冷水，不熬夜。
    第五、保证生产的安全，尽可能改善劳动条件，力求减少和避免工伤事故。
    二、办好公共食堂
    公共食堂是集体生活福利事业的中心，办得好不好，直接关系到在公共食堂吃饭的每一个人。办得好，公共食堂就能巩固。办得不好，公共食堂就可能垮台。怎样才算办好？就是要保证吃饱、吃好，让每一个在食堂吃饭的人感到比在家里吃饭还好。
    第一、要吃饱。无论是产粮区，或者是非产粮区，无论是丰收区，或者是欠收区，无论是已经实行粮食供给制地区，或者是尚未实行粮食供给制地区，公共食堂一律要管饱，不管谁有多大的饭量也要管饱。
    第二、要吃好。饭菜要多样化，要有味道。要有菜有汤，有荤有素，有干饭，有稀饭，有开水，尽可能做到人人满意。
    第三、要吃的干净卫生。要经常保证食堂和炊具的清洁。用过的碗筷、匙子等要用开水消毒。有传染病的人要分开吃饭，或者允许他们把饭菜打回家去吃。
    第四、公共食堂要有餐厅。公共食堂可以附设小卖部，卖些荤菜、点心、烟、酒和日用品。要有菜园，有酱园，有养猪场，有豆腐坊、粉坊，有腌菜、泡菜、腌鱼、腌肉等。
    第五、公共食堂要实现管理民主化。食堂管理人员和炊事员，都要经过群众选举产生。对于群众公认为工作成绩很大的优秀管理人员和炊事员，要给以适当的奖励。要帮助食堂管理人员和炊事员提高觉悟。要教育全体社员把办食堂当做一项崇高的为人民服务的工作。食堂工作人员和在食堂吃饭的人，互相之间，都应当态度和蔼，团结互助，共同努力改进工作，防止浪费现象。在食堂吃饭的人，有轮流“帮厨”的义务，使食堂工作人员有适当的休息时间。要简化打饭菜的手续，尽可能给在食堂吃饭的人以方便。
    第六、本着“大集体、小自由”的原则，对于在食堂吃饭的人，应当允许有必要的机动。如病人、老人、小孩、孕妇等，可以打饭菜回去吃。在冷天，允许住居遥远的户，打饭回去吃，或者在家做饭吃。各户都可以有小锅灶，要分给各户一部分柴、草、粗谷糠等，以便他们在冬天能够烧火炉（即烘笼）、烧水、炒饭、炒菜。还要允许各户养猪、养鸡、腌鱼、腌肉、腌菜等。
    第七、搞好工地食堂，保证工地上工作的人吃饱、吃好。
    第八、在食堂吃饭的人数和食堂工作人员人数，目前应当是二十比一，或者二十五比一。食堂工作人员当中，应当是有全劳动力，也有半劳动力。并要尽可能改革炊事工具，减轻和改善炊事劳动，提高效率。
    第九、在公共食堂吃饭的社员，来了客人，可以带到食堂吃饭，食堂不另外添菜招待。个人对来客自行加菜者，食堂在可能范围内给以方便。
    第十、应当分批举办炊事员训练班，使所有食堂的炊事员都能够不断地提高烹饪技术，增加卫生知识，发扬热爱食堂工作的精神。
    第十一、不准地主分子、富农分子、反革命分子、坏分子、右派分子在公共食堂担任任何职务。要教育群众提高革命警惕性，严防敌人在公共食堂进行破坏活动。如发现这样的罪犯，立即逮捕法办。
    第十二、以生产队为单位建立食堂。由于生产队人数过多，伙食不易办好，可以在统一管理下，采取分开起伙的办法，根据需要，分设若干餐厅。
    三、住宅问题第一、各公社要有一个至若干个建筑队。工地上，一定要有可以避风雪的工棚。因积肥拆掉的房屋，要抓紧时间修复起来。修复的住宅，要人畜分居。并要注意修缮畜舍，以利过冬。第二、各公社要逐户检查住宅，及时做好住宅的防寒过冬工作。
    第三、各县委、人民公社党委，要在进行城镇规划、土地规划的同时，做出集体新村规划；并且搞好试点，在新村规模、房屋式样、园林化、讲卫生以及禾场、道路、公墓、厕所、畜舍的建筑等方面，做出样子。争取全省农村的人民公社，在今后几年内，分批完成集体新村的建设工作。新建住宅要便于一家男女老少的团聚。
    四、关心老年人和妇女儿童
    第一、办好敬老院，使无依无靠的老人，老有所养。
    第二、办好托儿所和幼儿园。选择身体好、爱干净、爱护儿童的青壮年妇女，担任托儿所和幼儿园的保育员。分批举办保育员训练班，提高他们的业务知识和工作热情。要教育全体社员把保育儿童的工作当做一项崇高的为人民服务的工作。不准派有传染病的人担任保育员。各级妇联要全力做好这项工作。
    第三、对待妇女，除了必须同工同酬，照顾妇女经期卫生之外，还必须耐心帮助妇女学习文化和技术。对待孕妇、产妇、哺乳的母亲更要妥善照顾，应当根据具体情况设置助产室。
    五、做好卫生工作
    第一、全省城镇乡村都应当向卫生工作的模范市——沙市看齐，发动群众修订除五害（苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀、钉螺）、灭五病（血吸虫病、疟疾、现症梅毒、钩虫病、丝虫病）、讲卫生的工作规划，并且迅速行动起来，力争一两年内做到基本上除掉五害，灭掉五病。
    第二、健全医疗机构（如人民公社的中心卫生院，大队的分院，分院以下的保健站、保健室等），做好医疗工作，简化医疗手续，尽可能给病人以各种方便。
    第三、搞好公共澡堂，不愿在公共澡堂洗澡者，允许把洗澡水打回去洗澡。
    第四、搞好一切住宅和一切公共场所的清洁卫生。
    六、积极开展群众性的文化娱乐和体育活动
    第一、在紧张劳动的间隙，干部领导歌舞演唱，是一种很好的休息，是进行宣传鼓动工作的好机会。各级党委要发动群众，搞好田间工地的文娱活动。
    第二、在1959年春节期间，要大搞文娱体育活动，让全体劳动者玩一个痛快，搞一个大规模的文娱体育运动，搞会演，开运动会，同时，做好时事政策等方面的宣传鼓动工作。
    第三、积极培养工厂、农村的自编、自导、自演的不脱离生产的小型剧团，并且要注意有计划地帮助他们逐步提高政治水平和文化艺术水平。
    第四、把群众性的体育活动和民兵的军事训练结合起来，做好国防体育工作。
    要保证上述各项任务的胜利完成，关键在于各级党组织的领导。
    第一、省委即将成立生活福利委员会，在省委农村部的主持之下，组织省级有关部门共同加强对全省生活福利工作的领导。省委指定省委书记处书记王延春同志总管这方面的工作。各地委、县委、人民公社党委都应当立即建立生活福利部。各级党委的副书记、副专员、副县长和人民公社的副主任中，都要各有一人专管生活福利工作。
    第二、各项生活福利工作都要搞好，还要切实贯彻勤俭办生活福利事业的精神，因地制宜，量力而为，节约使用人力、财力、物力，防止铺张浪费。
    第三、责成各级党委亲自办好一个食堂，一个托儿所，一个敬老院，以便总结经验，及时推广。并且要定期检查评比，开展红旗竞赛。要做好有关当前人民生活几项工作，一定要政治挂帅，一定要放手发动群众。要在做好这些工作当中提高群众的政治觉悟，鼓起更大干劲，推动工农业生产和各项工作更大的跃进。
    第四、这个规定适用于农村，原则上也适用于城市。武汉市、黄石市和各地委、市委可以参照这个规定提出做好城市人民生活工作的具体规定，报省委批准执行。
