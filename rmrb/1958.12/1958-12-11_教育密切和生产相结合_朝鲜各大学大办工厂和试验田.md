Education Closely Integrated with Production
North Korean Universities Vigorously Run Factories and Experimental Farms
Xinhua News Agency dispatch: North Korean universities' teachers and students have recently further implemented the North Korean Labor Party's educational policy of combining education and production, vigorously running factories and experimental farms, actively participating in productive labor, and have already achieved many new accomplishments.

Kim Il-sung University students have recently produced more than fifty types of trial products, many of which are the first products ever made in North Korean history. Students in the Department of Physics and Mathematics recently made a telescope with a 20-centimeter aperture and a microscope that can magnify 200 times. Next year, they will produce 200 microscopes. The lenses they make themselves are no less than imported ones. They are now building an observatory themselves. The production of telescopes and microscopes is a first in North Korean history.

The Department of Chemistry has built two small cement kilns and will produce 1,000 tons of cement next year to meet the needs of the school's new building construction.

Kim Il-sung University's teachers and students have a fine tradition of participating in productive labor. Mao Zedong Avenue in Pyongyang and the Moranbong Stadium were built by them. This year, they spent forty days opening a forty-mile-long road in Daesongsan Park in Pyongyang. In the next two years, they will continue to complete this huge park with mountains and ponds. In addition, they also help farmers with rice transplanting and autumn harvesting every year.

Like Kim Il-sung University, North Korean universities have made remarkable achievements in this regard. At the upcoming exhibition of trial products from North Korean universities, one can see the semiconductor radios and small lathes trial-produced by teachers and students of Kim Chaek University of Technology, and the pig iron produced in self-built blast furnaces; forty-eight kinds of medicines produced by the self-built pharmaceutical factory of Pyongyang Medical University; and photographic film, photosensitive paper, and cotton made of straw produced by Hamhung University of Technology.

    教育密切和生产相结合
    朝鲜各大学大办工厂和试验田
    据新华社讯  朝鲜各大学师生最近进一步贯彻朝鲜劳动党提出的教育和生产相结合的教育方针，大办工厂和试验田，积极参加生产劳动，并且已经取得了许多新的成就。
    金日成综合大学的学生最近已经生产了五十多种试制品，其中不少还是朝鲜历史上第一次制成的产品。物理数学系的学生最近制成了一架口径二十公分的天体望远镜和可放大二百倍的显微镜，到明年他们就要生产二百台显微镜。他们自制的镜片并不亚于进口品。现在他们正在自己建设一座天文台。生产望远镜和显微镜在朝鲜历史上还是第一次。
    化学系建设了两座小水泥窑，明年要生产一千吨水泥，满足学校建设新校舍的需要。
    金日成大学的师生们参加生产劳动有着优良的传统，平壤的毛泽东大街和牡丹峰运动场都是他们修建的。今年他们又以四十天的时间在平壤市大圣山公园开辟了一条四十里长的道路，明后年他们要继续包干建成这座有山、有池的巨大公园。另外，他们每年还帮助农民插秧、秋收。
    像金日成大学一样，朝鲜各大学在这方面都取得了显著的成就。在即将开幕的朝鲜各大学试制品展览会上，就可以看到金策工业大学师生们试制的半导体收音机、小车床和自建高炉中生产的生铁，平壤医科大学最近自建的药厂中生产的四十八种药品，咸兴工业大学生产的摄影胶片、感光纸、用稻草做的棉花。
