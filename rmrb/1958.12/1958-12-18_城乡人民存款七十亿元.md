Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: This year, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the greatly enhanced ideological awareness of the people, the People's Bank's savings work has achieved unprecedented development.

According to statistics from the People's Bank of China, by November of this year, the balance of urban people's savings deposits nationwide had reached 4 billion yuan, and the balance of rural savings deposits had reached 3.008 billion yuan. The increase in urban and rural people's deposits in the eleven months exceeded the average annual increase during the first five-year plan by more than three times. As of November, the rural deposit balance was equivalent to 89.8% of the agricultural loans issued during the same period. In 1953, at the beginning of the first five-year plan, rural deposits were only equivalent to 17.2% of the agricultural loans issued during the same period, and even in 1957, rural deposits were only equivalent to 64.8% of agricultural loans.

Based on available information, dozens of counties across the country have achieved 100% farmer household savings in banks. In cities, many institutions, enterprises, and factory workers and cadres have savings, realizing savings "red all over." Everywhere is warm, everywhere is home.
