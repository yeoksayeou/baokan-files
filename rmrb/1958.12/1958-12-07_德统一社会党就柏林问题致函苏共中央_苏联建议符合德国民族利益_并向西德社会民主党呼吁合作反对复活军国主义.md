Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 6th: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) has written to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on the issues of West Berlin and the situation in West Germany, as well as the tasks of defending peace. The letter expresses full agreement with the Soviet government's proposals on West Berlin, believing that these proposals serve to consolidate peace and the national interests of the German people.

    The letter, published on the 4th, points out that West Berlin has become a dangerous source of military adventures organized by imperialist aggressors. Only by realizing the Soviet government's proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city can the foreign military occupation of West Berlin be ended, and West Berlin will never again be a center for espionage and sabotage activities against the German Democratic Republic.

    The letter states that the peace-loving residents of West Berlin, after being freed from Western occupation, can resolve their internal affairs according to their own interests.

    The letter condemns the Western countries for violating the Potsdam Agreement. It states that the Western countries' purpose in violating the Potsdam Agreement is to preserve and revive German militarism and to divide Germany.

    The letter says that the German Democratic Republic resolutely opposes militarism and the military adventures of imperialism, which can only lead to tragic endings.

    The letter emphasizes: "The German Democratic Republic will do everything in its power to prevent any aggressive plans of the disruptors of peace from being realized."

    The letter reiterates the German Democratic Republic's program for the peaceful resolution of the German question.

    The letter concludes by stating that the German Democratic Republic will unite even more closely with the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, and will strive to continue strengthening the socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 5th: In a letter to the West German Social Democratic Party, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) suggests that delegations from the SED, the Social Democratic Party, trade unions, and other mass organizations visit both parts of Germany. German workers and workers' organizations should publicly discuss the following issues:

    1. Analysis of the situation and dangers caused by German militarism;
    2. Measures to eliminate the dangers emanating from West Berlin;
    3. Issues related to a peace treaty with Germany;
    4. Reconciliation between the two Germanies and the establishment of a confederation in order to take measures to unite Germany into a peace-loving and democratic state.

    The letter states that further negotiations can be held to discuss the establishment of economic relations with a demilitarized West Berlin, as well as to discuss increasing the amount of hard coal, steel, and textiles purchased from West Germany.

    Referring to the talks that have already taken place between bourgeois politicians in West Germany and representatives of the German Democratic Republic, the letter states that the leaders of the SED have expressed their willingness to meet with leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party.

    The letter further states that in order to create a positive atmosphere for further negotiations, the Berlin issue must be resolved. The withdrawal of foreign troops and the transformation of West Berlin into a free city would be a practical and reasonable way to resolve the Berlin issue. The letter says: "Although we have differences of opinion on fundamental issues, the vital interests of the nation require the Social Democratic Party, the SED, and other German workers' organizations to cooperate, at least on one issue - opposition to atomic armament and opposition to German militarism."

    德统一社会党就柏林问题致函苏共中央
    苏联建议符合德国民族利益
    并向西德社会民主党呼吁合作反对复活军国主义
    新华社柏林6日电  德国统一社会党中央委员会就西柏林和西德形势及保卫和平的任务等问题写信给苏联共产党中央委员会。信中表示完全同意苏联政府关于西柏林问题的建议，认为这个建议是为巩固和平和为德国人民的民族利益服务的。
    这封信已经在4日发表。信中指出，西柏林已经成为帝国主义侵略者组织军事冒险的一个危险策源地，只有实现苏联政府关于把西柏林变成非军事化自由城市的建议，才可以结束外国对西柏林的军事占领，永远不再使西柏林成为对民主德国进行间谍和破坏活动的中心。
    信中说，爱好和平生活的西柏林居民在摆脱西方的占领以后，是可以按照自己的利益解决自己的内部事务的。
    这封信谴责西方国家破坏了波茨坦协定。信中说，西方国家破坏波茨坦协定的目的就是要保存和复活德国军国主义，并且分裂德国。
    信中说，民主德国坚决反对军国主义，反对帝国主义在军事上进行的冒险。这种冒险只能得到悲惨的结局。
    信中着重说：“民主德国将尽一切努力，使和平的破坏者的任何侵略计划都不能实现”。
    这封信重申了民主德国关于和平解决德国问题的纲领。
    这封信最后表示，民主德国将更加紧密地和苏联、中国以及其他社会主义国家团结一致，并为继续加强社会主义阵营而奋斗。
    新华社柏林5日电  德国统一社会党中央委员会在给西德社会民主党的信件中建议，通过德国统一社会党、社会民主党、工会和其他群众组织的代表团到德国两部分进行访问，由德国工人和工人组织来公开讨论下列问题：
    一、分析德国军国主义所引起的局势和危险；
    二、为消除来自西柏林的危险而采取措施；
    三、同对德和约有关的问题；
    四、使两个德国和解并成立邦联，以便采取措施把德国统一成一个爱好和平的民主国家。
    信中说，可以举行进一步的谈判来讨论同非军事化的西柏林建立经济关系的问题，以及讨论增加向西德购买硬煤、钢和纺织品的数量的问题。
    谈到西德的资产阶级政治家和德意志民主共和国代表之间已经举行会谈时，信中说，德国统一社会党领导人表示愿意同西德社会民主党领袖会谈。
    信中又说，为了创造进一步谈判的正当气氛，必须解决柏林问题。而撤出外国军队和把西柏林变成一个自由城市将是解决柏林问题的切实可行和合理的办法。这封信说：“虽然我们在基本问题上意见有分歧，但是民族的切身利益要求社会民主党、德国统一社会党和德国的其他工人组织至少在这样一个问题——反对原子武装和反对德国军国主义——上进行合作。”
