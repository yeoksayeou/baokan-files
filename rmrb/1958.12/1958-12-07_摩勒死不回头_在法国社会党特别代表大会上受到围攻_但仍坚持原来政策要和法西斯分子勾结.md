    Mollet Refuses to Turn Back
    Besieged at the French Socialist Party Special Congress
    Still Insists on His Original Policy of Colluding with Fascists

    (Report from our newspaper) Mollet, the right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party, was strongly criticized by delegates at the Socialist Party Special Congress on December 4. Although Mollet ultimately used the voting machine he controlled to pass a resolution in his favor, many political observers in Paris pointed out that the Mollet group's position within the Socialist Party has been further weakened.

    Biting the Hand That Feeds You

    Why did the Socialist Party convene this special congress? It was because it suffered a serious defeat in the recent elections.

    The right-wing leadership group of the Socialist Party, which has been working for de Gaulle, as usual, prostrated itself to de Gaulle in this French National Assembly election. In order to exclude the French Communist Party, de Gaulle formulated an extremely reactionary "small constituency two-round voting system"; the Mollet group actively expressed its support. During the election, the Mollet group also colluded with candidates from right-wing parties to deprive candidates from the French Communist Party of seats. Conversely, the Mollet group spared no effort in praising the "Union for the New Republic" controlled by de Gaulle.

    The Mollet group did this because it believed that by making every effort to attack the French Communist Party in the election, it could make voters who were originally under the influence of the French Communist Party change their votes to the Socialist Party, thereby improving the Socialist Party's political position.

    What was the result? In this election, the Socialist Party's votes did not increase, but decreased. The number of seats held by the Socialist Party in the parliament fell from about one hundred to forty. As a result, there was a surge of anger within the Socialist Party. The Mollet group lifted a stone only to drop it on their own feet, and they had to convene a special congress to deal with the dissatisfaction within the party.

    Besieged on All Sides

    As soon as the special meeting began, Mollet was besieged by the delegates. Former Minister Gazier and Socialist Party Steering Committee member Prijan, who spoke at the meeting, both opposed the current policies of the right-wing leadership of the Socialist Party.

    Prijan believes that the Socialist Party has abandoned its responsibility. He expressed regret about the attitude taken by the Socialist Party since the fascist rebellion on May 13. In his speech, Gazier pointed out that the Socialist Party's policies and program should be re-examined, and for this reason, a party congress must be convened within the next two months. Other speakers also criticized the policies of the Mollet group.

    Refuses to Turn Back

    Under the siege of the delegates, Socialist Party General Secretary Mollet had to admit in his speech that the Socialist Party had suffered a defeat in the election. However, he insisted on continuing to implement the policy of alliance with right-wing parties, and opposed convening a congress to re-examine the Socialist Party's political direction.

    At the meeting, Mollet asked for support for de Gaulle as a candidate for President of the Republic, and opposed Socialist Party ministers withdrawing from the government.

    The reason why Mollet dared to turn a blind eye to the dissatisfaction of the party members and refuse to turn back is that his group controls many provincial committees and can get a majority in the voting. At the end of the meeting, he turned on the voting machine and passed a resolution guaranteeing that the Socialist Party would support de Gaulle as president, and also decided to submit the relevant issues to the Socialist Party National Committee under Mollet's control for review.

    Bleak Prospects

    Mollet has passed the test again this time. However, his future is bleak, which can already be foreseen. Political observers in Paris specifically pointed out that the original minority faction within the Socialist Party had recently split off and formed an independent socialist party, but the situation of the Mollet group has not improved at this special congress. This shows how strong the opposition to the Mollet group's policies is among ordinary party members.

    摩勒死不回头
    在法国社会党特别代表大会上受到围攻
    但仍坚持原来政策要和法西斯分子勾结
    本报讯  法国社会党右翼领袖摩勒，在12月4日社会党特别代表大会上受到了代表们的强烈抨击。尽管摩勒在最后开动他所控制的表决机器使会议通过了对他有利的决议，但是巴黎很多政治观察家指出：摩勒集团在社会党内的地位又进一步削弱。
    自食恶果
    社会党为什么要召开这次特别代表大会呢？这是因为它在最近的选举中遭到了严重的失败。
    一直为戴高乐奔走效劳的社会党右翼领导集团，在这次法国国民议会选举中照例还是卑躬屈膝地为戴高乐出力。戴高乐为了排挤法国共产党，制订了极端反动的“小选区二轮投票制”；摩勒集团就积极表示支持。在选举时，摩勒集团又和右翼政党的候选人勾结，来剥夺法国共产党候选人的议席。相反地，对于戴高乐控制的“保卫新共和联盟”，摩勒集团却竭力吹捧。
    摩勒集团这样做，是以为在选举中竭力打击法共，就可以使原来在法共影响下的选民改投社会党的票，使社会党的政治地位得到提高。
    结果怎样呢？在这次选举中，社会党的选票不是增加了，而是减少了。社会党在议会中的席位，从一百席左右下降为四十席。于是社会党内群情激愤，摩勒集团搬起石头打自己的脚，不得不召开特别代表大会来应付党内的不满情绪。
    四面楚歌
    特别会议一开始，摩勒就遭到代表们的围攻。在会上发言的前部长加齐埃和社会党指导委员会委员普里让等人都反对社会党右翼领导的现行政策。
    普里让认为社会党已经背弃了它的责任。他对从5月13日法西斯叛乱发生以来社会党所采取的态度表示遗憾。加齐埃在发言中指出，应该重新审查社会党的政策和纲领，为此必须在最近两个月内召开党的代表大会。其他发言者也都批评了摩勒集团的政策。
    死不回头
    在代表们的围攻下，社会党总书记摩勒在发言中不得不承认社会党在选举中遭到失败。但是他却坚持继续执行同右翼党派联盟的政策，并且反对召开代表大会重新审查社会党的政治方针。
    在会上，摩勒要求支持戴高乐为共和国总统候选人，并且反对社会党部长退出政府。
    摩勒之所以敢于不顾党内群众不满而死不回头，是依凭着他的集团控制着很多省委会，在表决时可以得到多数。在会议快结束时，他就把表决机器一开，通过决议，保证社会党支持戴高乐当总统，还决定把有关问题提交在摩勒控制下的社会党全国委员会审查。
    前途不妙
    摩勒这次又过了关。但是，他的前途不妙，已经可以预见。巴黎的政治观察家们特别指出这一点：社会党内原来的少数派，不久前已经分裂出去另组独立社会党，但是在这次特别代表大会上摩勒集团的处境并没有改善。这说明，摩勒集团的政策在普通党员内引起了多么强烈的反对。
