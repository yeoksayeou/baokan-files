    Get Agricultural Products to Where They Are Needed

    This newspaper reports that Jiangxi Province has basically completed its agricultural product transportation work for this year. As of the statistics on November 18th, except for cotton and jute, which have completed over 90% of their transportation plans, the transportation plans for live pigs, ramie, tobacco, tangerines, etc., have all been completed. Industrial products supplied to the rural market, totaling more than 236,000 tons, have been shipped down since July, basically achieving the timely transfer of agricultural products such as cotton and live pigs to cities, meeting the needs of cities and exports, and also meeting the needs of the people's communes for industrial products.
    Jiangxi Province has many mountainous areas, and transportation is inconvenient; since the mass campaign for steel production began, transportation has become even busier, with the volume of transportation increasing fivefold compared to the same period last year. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of transportation work, transportation command headquarters have been established in all special districts, cities, counties, and even people's communes throughout the province, and command stations have been established in ports and transportation hubs. Party organizations at all levels have made comprehensive arrangements for transportation work and organized and launched a mass transportation movement. Each people's commune in Ganxian County has organized a professional transportation team of 30 to 50 people, using this as the backbone to organize all the forces that can be mobilized; various vehicles and ships scattered in rural areas and towns have also been centralized, comprehensively arranged, and used uniformly. In mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, manpower is organized to carry materials to the roadside and docks, or materials are airlifted to convenient transportation locations using slides, and then shipped out by vehicles and ships. In this way, the county has not only ensured steel transportation but also ensured the timely transportation of industrial and agricultural products. Since November, the county has transferred out more than 1,000 tons of agricultural products and non-staple foods and transferred in daily-use industrial products.
    In order to fully utilize transportation capacity, the province has recently organized three large-scale return-trip transportation efforts, transporting a total of more than 40,000 tons of materials. Xinyu County has also adopted the method of matching light and heavy cargo, loading iron underneath the vehicles and stacking cotton on top, ensuring that every train car is fully loaded. Various localities have also deeply mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out transportation tool reforms and create new transportation methods. The Wenjiazhen transfer station in Linchuan County and the Shangrao Trading Company have created a five-layer card-loading pig method, with each train car loading 150 more pigs than before; Jiujiang County has modified the cotton double-box baling machine, increasing the loading rate of vehicles and ships by 59%. Many areas have also greatly accelerated transportation speed by cutting unnecessary links and implementing direct allocation and direct transportation through four-comparison accounting (comparing mileage, comparing transit time, comparing freight, comparing loading and unloading convenience).

    快调运  快加工
    把农产品送到需要的地方
    本报讯  江西省今年农产品调运工作已基本完成。截至11月18日的统计，除棉花、黄麻的调运计划完成90％以上外，生猪、蒌麻、烟叶、柑桔等的调运计划都已全部完成。供应农村市场的工业品，从7月份起共运下去二十三万六千多吨，基本上做到了把棉花、生猪等农产品及时调往城市，供应了城市和出口的需要，同时供应了人民公社对工业品的需要。
    江西省山区多，交通不便；全民大办钢铁以来，运输更加繁忙，运输量比去年同期增加五倍。为了加强对交通运输工作的组织领导，全省各专区、市、县直到人民公社都成立了交通运输指挥部，港口和交通枢纽都建立了指挥站。各级党组织对运输工作都作了全面安排，组织开展了全民性的运输运动。赣县各人民公社都组织了三十到五十人的专业运输队，以此为骨干，把可以动员的力量全部组织起来；分散在农村、城镇的各种车船也全部集中，全面安排，统一使用。在交通不便的山区，组织人力将物资挑运到公路旁和码头上，或者用滑道空运物资到交通便利地点，然后由车船装运外调。这样，这个县既保证了钢铁运输，又保证了工农业产品的及时调运。11月份以来，这个县调出农产品、副食品，调进日用工业品，共达一千多吨。
    为了充分运用运输力量，全省最近先后组织了三次大规模的回空调运，共调运物资达四万多吨。新余县还采取了轻重配装的办法，车下面装铁，上面堆棉花，做到辆辆车皮满载。各地还深入发动群众，大搞运输工具改革和创造新的运输方法。临川县温家圳转运站、上饶贸易公司创造了五层卡装猪法，每个车皮比原来多装一百五十头；九江县改装棉花双箱打包机，提高车船装载率59％。很多地区还通过四比核算（比里程，比在途时间，比运费，比装卸便利），大砍多余环节，直拨直运，大大加快了运输速度。
