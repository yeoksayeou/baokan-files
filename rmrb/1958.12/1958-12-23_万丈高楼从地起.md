    A Tall Building Rises From the Ground
    Xiao Min
    As the saying goes, "A tall building rises from the ground." To build a skyscraper, you must first lay a good foundation. If the foundation is not solid, the building will not be stable. Learning is the same. To pursue advanced studies, one must have a basic level of education and foundational knowledge in certain areas.
    Recently, in the teaching reforms of some spare-time schools and half-work, half-study schools, there have been some inappropriate arrangements for basic courses. Some schools have cut and merged redundant and unsuitable teaching materials based on the principle of "cut, merge, and supplement," which is good. However, some have inappropriately weakened basic courses, which is questionable. Because basic courses are compulsory for students, whether the proportion of basic courses is appropriate and whether they are taught well are greatly related to further improving the educational quality of these schools.
    There is a saying: "Learn what you do." Is this saying correct? The answer is yes and no. It is correct because "learn what you do" closely integrates doing and using, education and production, making it easier for students to accept and more effective, which has a positive effect on overcoming the past educational separation from production and theory from practice. However, this statement is not comprehensive. It seems that for people engaged in a certain profession, schools only need to provide the knowledge required for that profession, and whether or not to teach other knowledge, or even broader basic knowledge, and how much to teach, seems unimportant, which is not good.
    Spare-time schools are not merely technical schools that only cultivate students' skills in a specific area. They also gradually improve the cultural and technical level of workers and peasants, providing students with more comprehensive basic knowledge within the possible conditions, which is beneficial to the further studies, self-study, and comprehensive development of workers and peasants. Therefore, our principle is to emphasize labor classes in schools lacking labor classes, and to emphasize basic classes in schools lacking basic classes, so that all spare-time schools develop towards the aspects they lack, and gradually move towards a more perfect combination of theory and practice.
    Of course, the situations of spare-time schools and half-work, half-study schools are very different, and the conditions vary. Which basic courses to set up, which not to set up, which to increase, and which to decrease should be determined based on specific conditions such as teachers, and cannot be discussed in a vacuum, detached from reality. However, for basic courses that are available and already offered, it is necessary to properly arrange the basic courses during the teaching reform and not reduce them excessively.

    万丈高楼从地起
    萧敏
    俗话说得好：“万丈高楼从地起”。修建一座高楼大厦，先要打好基础。基础打不好，建起的大厦就不会稳固。学习也是这样。要深造，就要具有起码的文化水平和某些方面的基础知识。
    最近，有些业余学校、半工半读学校在进行教学改革中，对于基础课的摆法还有不尽适当之处。有的学校根据“砍、并、补”的原则，砍掉、合并了重复和不适宜这类学校用的一些教材，这是好的；但是，也有的却不适当地削弱了基础课，这种做法就值得商榷了。因为基础课是学生必修的课程，基础课分量是否适当，教得好坏，对于进一步提高这类学校的教育质量关系很大。
    有这样一种说法：“做什么，学什么”。这种说法对不对呢？回答是又对又不对。说它对，是因为“做什么，学什么”，做和用，教育和生产紧密结合起来，学生容易接受，收效大，对于克服过去教育脱离生产、理论脱离实际有积极作用。但是，这种说法不全面，好像从事那行职业的人，学校只要给予本行专业所需要的知识就够了，至于其他知识乃至较广泛的基础知识教或不教、教多教少似乎无关重要，这就不好了。
    业余学校不是单纯的工艺学校，只培养学生某一方面的技能，它还要逐步提高工农群众的文化技术水平，在可能条件内，给学生较全面的基础知识，对工农群众的深造、自学以及他们的全面发展都会有好处。因此，我们的原则是，在缺乏劳动课的学校里要强调劳动课，在缺乏基础课的学校里要强调基础课，使所有的业余学校都各向自己所缺的方面发展，逐步向理论和实际的更完善的结合前进。
    当然，业余学校和半工半读学校的情况很不一样，条件各不相同，基础课何者设，何者不设，何者该增，何者该减，应当视师资等具体条件而定，不能离开实际去空谈。但是，有条件并且已经开的基础课，在进行教学改革中，一定要把基础课摆得适当，不要过分减少。
