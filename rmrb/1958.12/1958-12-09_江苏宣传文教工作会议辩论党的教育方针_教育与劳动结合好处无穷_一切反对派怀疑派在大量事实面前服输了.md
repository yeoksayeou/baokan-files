    Report from this newspaper: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a propaganda and culture work conference from November 4th to 28th. Based on summarizing and reviewing the province's cultural and educational work over the past year, the conference adopted the method of extensive airing of views, debate, and big-character posters to further discuss the Party's education policy, thereby determining the basic tasks of the province's propaganda and cultural work for 1959. More than 1,300 people attended the conference, including secretaries of local, municipal, and county party committees, heads of propaganda and culture departments, heads of culture and education bureaus (sections), and party secretaries of various universities and some secondary schools.
    The conference believed that in the past year, under the leadership of the Party, Jiangsu Province's cultural and educational undertakings have achieved tremendous results due to the correct implementation of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, adhering to the struggle between the two lines of combining education with productive labor versus separating education from productive labor, and adhering to "walking on two legs." The province's cultural and educational undertakings have seen an unprecedented great leap forward, great development, and great popularization, forming a cultural revolution upsurge of the whole Party running education and the whole people learning culture. Bourgeois educators and dogmatists once asserted that it would take a century for Jiangsu to eliminate illiteracy, and it would take 40 to 50 years to popularize primary and secondary education. However, under the shining light of the Party's General Line, Jiangsu Province, with a population of 45 million, basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people and popularized primary education within a year. Secondary schools and universities also increased rapidly. In particular, the establishment and development of agricultural middle schools developed the experience of the mass line in education, driving the overall leap forward of educational undertakings. The province's cultural, health, and sports undertakings have also developed at an astonishing rate. A mass creation upsurge dominated by folk songs and murals and other literary and artistic activities have emerged throughout the province.
    However, implementing the Party's policy of combining education with labor is essentially a great revolution against the old traditions of thousands of years. In the past six months, although most people have actively supported and consciously implemented the Party's education policy, some people still have one-sided ideological methods, putting education and productive labor in opposition to each other. Others still have bourgeois educational ideas and hold skeptical, wait-and-see, or resistant attitudes towards the Party's education policy. According to a survey in Jiangyin County, among teachers, 25% supported the Party's education policy, 50% were in an intermediate state, and 25% opposed it. This shows that to more thoroughly implement the Party's education policy throughout the province, struggle is still needed in ideology, methods, and paths. Therefore, the conference used twelve days to mobilize more than 1,300 representatives inside the conference and sixteen universities and educational administrative departments outside the conference to conscientiously study the "Instructions on Education Work" from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council and Comrade Lu Dingyi's article "Education Must Be Combined with Productive Labor." They further unfolded a heated study and debate on the Party's education policy by means of extensive airing of views and big-character posters. Among the more than 80,000 big-character posters, the most common ideas exposed were that cadres still have many one-sided understandings of the Party's education policy. For example, some people emphasized the contradiction between education and labor, saying: "Education and labor are contradictory opposites that cannot be unified. To do a good job in education, one cannot labor; to labor, one will inevitably affect education. The two cannot be combined." In addition, some comrades, seeing the achievements of combining work and study in the past year, then believed that "labor is education, and only through the practice of productive labor can one increase knowledge. Productive labor can completely replace school education." The conference focused on the dialectical relationship between education and labor. The conference believed that the purpose of education is to guide people's labor practice. Any education that is divorced from labor cannot enable people to obtain comprehensive knowledge. Only emphasizing pure physical labor, without paying attention to the study and research of culture and science and the combination of productive labor, it is impossible to climb the peaks of science and technology. The Party's policy of combining education with labor is a unity of contradictions. Only when the two are combined can the old education undergo qualitative changes, and can everyone in society be cultivated into intellectuals who are both knowledgeable and involved in labor, and laborers who are both knowledgeable and involved in labor.
    During the conference, many comrades also launched a tit-for-tat debate on whether combining education and labor would reduce teaching quality. At the conference, some comrades still viewed the issue of teaching quality from the perspective of bourgeois education. They said: "Today's students are neither fish nor fowl, neither workers nor peasants, neither laborers nor intellectuals." Some people said that the people cultivated according to the Party's education policy are at most "jacks-of-all-trades who know nothing," or "newspaper clipping clerks." Comrades who disagreed with this view used the facts of many major achievements of combining work and study in the past year to persuade them. In the past, mathematics teachers could not calculate the volume of small blast furnaces, physics teachers could not install electric lights, chemistry teachers could not use fertilizers, and biology teachers did not understand planting and breeding. Their knowledge was far inferior to that of ordinary workers and peasants. However, in just six months, through the combination of education and productive labor, many students have been using the knowledge they have learned to solve practical problems in production and work. University students are attacking the cutting edge of science and technology. These facts show that implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor is the only way to cultivate new people who are both red and expert and comprehensively developed. In the process of the debate, everyone further clarified that the standard for measuring teaching quality in the future should completely abandon the bourgeois standard. The quality standard of our socialist education should be "to enable the educated to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture."
    In many big-character posters, it was also revealed that cadres in some places had some shortcomings in their actual work due to a one-sided understanding of the Party's education policy, especially in the improper arrangement of education and labor time. In some primary and secondary schools, students' labor time was arranged too much, and teaching time was too little. Some schools even suspended classes for too much time and too long. Also, some places excessively and hastily canceled some necessary subjects, affecting the teaching of basic knowledge. This originally belonged to the issue of working methods and work style, but some opposition and skeptical factions inside and outside the conference attributed these individual shortcomings to the Party's education policy, believing that this was also the consequence of combining education and labor. Many comrades at the meeting criticized and debated this.
    This debate was a profound rectification study for the more than 1,300 representatives attending the meeting, and a study to correct ideological methods. Therefore, the conference decided to further promote and study the Party's education policy in depth throughout the province this winter and next spring. On the basis of summarizing the achievements of combining work and study in the past year in various schools and educational administrative departments, launch an extensive airing of views with the Party's education policy as the central content, focusing on the significance of combining education and labor; the goal of cultivation; the standards of education quality; the methods of combining education and productive labor; and who to rely on to run education. A large-scale ideological debate will be launched on these five issues to lay a solid ideological foundation for striving for a greater leap forward in education work next year.
    The conference finally discussed and determined the basic tasks of the province's propaganda and cultural work in 1959: First, to widely and deeply carry out socialist and communist ideological education; second, to further publicize, study, and implement the Party's education policy, so that the province's education work can better move forward.

    江苏宣传文教工作会议辩论党的教育方针
    教育与劳动结合好处无穷
    一切反对派怀疑派在大量事实面前服输了
    本报讯  中共江苏省委于11月4日到28日，召开了宣传、文教工作会议。会议在总结检查一年来全省文教工作的基础上，采取大鸣大放大辩论的办法，进一步深入地讨论了党的教育方针，从而确定了1959年全省宣传、文教工作的基本任务。出席会议的有各地、市、县委书记，宣传、文教部长，文教局（科）长，各高等学校和部分中等学校的党委书记等一千三百多人。
    会议认为一年来，江苏省的文教事业在党的领导下，由于正确贯彻了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，坚持了教育与生产劳动相结合和教育与生产劳动分离的两种方针和群众办学还是专家办学的两条路线的斗争，坚持了“两条腿走路”，因而取得了巨大的成绩，全省文教事业出现了历史上从未有过的大跃进大发展大普及的局面，形成了全党办教育，全民学文化的文化革命高潮。资产阶级教育学家和教条主义者曾经断言，江苏扫除文盲的任务要一个世纪才能完成，普及小学和普及中学没有四十年到五十年是不成的，可是在党的总路线光辉照耀下，拥有四千五百万人口的江苏省，在一年内基本上扫除了青壮年文盲，普及了小学教育，中学校和高等学校也飞速增加。特别是农业中学的创办发展了教育事业走群众路线的经验，带动了教育事业的全面跃进。全省文化、卫生、体育事业也同样以惊人的速度向前发展。全省各地出现了以民歌壁画为主体的群众创作高潮和其他文艺活动高潮。
    可是，贯彻党的教育与劳动相结合的方针，实质上是对几千年以来旧传统的一个大革命。半年来，虽然大多数人都是积极拥护和自觉地贯彻执行了党的教育方针，但仍有些人思想方法片面，把教育和生产劳动对立起来，还有些人存在着资产阶级的教育思想，他们对党的教育方针仍抱着怀疑、观望或抵触的情绪。据江阴县调查，在教师中，对党的教育方针拥护的占25％，中间状态的占50％，反对的占25％，这说明要在全省范围内更加彻底地贯彻党的教育方针，在思想、方法和道路上仍需经过斗争。因此，会议以十二天的时间，发动会内一千三百多代表和会外的十六个高等学校和教育行政部门，认真地学习了中共中央和国务院“关于教育工作的指示”和陆定一同志的“教育必须与生产劳动相结合”的文章等。并采取大鸣大放大字报的方式，进一步对党的教育方针展开了热烈的学习和辩论。在八万多张大字报中暴露出的思想，比较普遍的是干部对党的教育方针至今仍存在着不少片面的认识，如有人强调教育和劳动的矛盾说：“教育和劳动是不可统一的矛盾对立面，要搞好教育就不能劳动，要劳动势必影响教育，两者不可兼得。”另外有一部分同志，看到一年来勤工俭学的成就，便又认为“劳动就是教育，只有从事生产劳动的实践，才能增长知识，生产劳动完全可以代替学校教育。”会议集中地对教育与劳动之间的辩证的关系展开了辩论。会议认为，教育的目的是为了指导人们的劳动实践，任何脱离劳动的教育，都不可能使人得到全面的知识。只强调单纯的体力劳动，不重视文化科学的学习、研究和生产劳动的结合，是不可能攀登科学技术的高峰的。党的教育与劳动相结合的方针，是矛盾的统一体，只有两者结合起来，才能使旧的教育发生质的变化，才能把社会上的每一个人培养成既懂政治、又有文化，既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动，既是劳动化了的知识分子，又是知识化的劳动者。
    会议中，很多同志对教育与劳动相结合是否会降低教学质量的问题，也展开了针锋相对的辩论。会议上，有一部分同志仍用资产阶级的教育观点来看教学质量问题。他们说：“现在的学生是四不像，既不像工人农民，又不像学生，既不像劳动者，又不像知识分子。”有人说照党的教育方针培养出来的人，最多不过是“不学无术的万金油”，是“资料剪报员。”不同意这种看法的同志，用勤工俭学一年来的许多重大成就的事实说服了他们。过去，数学教师不会计算小高炉的容积，物理教师不会安装电灯，化学教师不会使用肥料，生物教师不懂种植和饲养，他们的知识远远不如一个普通的工人和农民。可是，仅仅半年的时间，通过教育与生产劳动的结合，不少学生已在运用自己学得的知识解决生产和工作中的实际问题，高等学校的学生正在猛攻科学技术的尖端，这些事实说明，贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，是培养又红又专的全面发展的新人的唯一方法。在辩论的过程中，大家又进一步明确了，今后衡量教学质量应该完全抛开资产阶级的标准，我们社会主义教育的质量标准，应该是“使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”
    在不少大字报中，也揭发了有些地方的干部由于对党的教育方针认识片面，因此在实际工作中曾存在一些缺点，特别是在教育和劳动的时间上没有安排得当。有些地方的中小学，把学生的劳动时间安排过多，教学的时间太少，有的学校甚至停课太多太久，也还有些地方过多过急地取消了一些必要的课目，影响了基础知识的教学。这本来属于工作方法和工作作风问题，但会议内外也有些反对派和怀疑派，把这些个别缺点归咎于党的教育方针，认为这也是教育和劳动相结合的后果。会议上许多同志对此作了批判和辩论。
    这一场辩论，对到会的一千三百多代表是一次深刻的整风学习，是一次端正思想方法的学习。因此会议决定在今冬明春在全省范围内进一步深入地宣传和学习党的教育方针。在各学校和教育行政部门总结一年来勤工俭学的成绩的基础上，开展一次以党的教育方针为中心内容的大鸣大放，围绕教育与劳动相结合的意义；培养的目标；教育质量的标准；教育和生产劳动相结合的方法和办好教育依靠谁等五个问题展开一次大规模的思想辩 论，为争取明年教育工作的更大跃进打下坚实的思想基础。
    会议最后讨论和确定了1959年全省宣传、文教工作的基本任务：一、广泛深入地开展社会主义和共产主义思想教育；二、进一步宣传、学习和贯彻党的教育方针，使全省教育工作更好地向前发展。
