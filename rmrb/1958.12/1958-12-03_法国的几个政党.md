    The French mainland's National Assembly elections have officially concluded. The French right-wing parties – the "Union for the New Republic," the Independent Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Socialist Party – relying on reactionary election laws and their mutual collusion, have seized the vast majority of seats in the French National Assembly. The following is a brief introduction to these four right-wing parties.

    The "Union for the New Republic" was founded on October 3rd of this year. It was personally organized by Soustelle, a right-hand man of De Gaulle and a political leader of the Algerian rebel group. In reality, it is De Gaulle's party. This "Union" mainly includes the following three political factions of De Gaulle: 1. Delbecque's "Republican Parliamentary Group," 2. "Union for the Rebirth of France," whose predecessor was Soustelle's "Union for the Salvation and Rebirth of French Algeria" (founded in 1956), 3. Chaban-Delmas' "Union of Citizens for the Fifth Republic." Other factions of De Gaulle, such as the "National Association for Supporting General De Gaulle's Action" and the "Center for Republican Reform," did not participate. To expand the right-wing leaning of this alliance, Soustelle maintained close ties with Bidault, Maurice, and Duchet. Due to internal contradictions, Soustelle did not serve as the General Secretary of the "Union," but was replaced by Roger Frey. A "Steering Committee" composed of thirteen members, including Soustelle, Delbecque, and Chaban-Delmas, was formed.

    The "Union's" political program clearly states that it is "loyal to General De Gaulle" and strives to realize the so-called "Gaullism," acting as De Gaulle's "powerful assistant." It tries its best to present itself as a "middle group" and a force for political "equilibrium." In reality, De Gaulle intends to use it as a basis for establishing a government of a single "party."

    Serious contradictions exist within the "Union." During this election, Soustelle, Delbecque, and Chaban-Delmas were constantly arguing over power and profit. Soustelle's attempt to install his confidants in the parliament was opposed by Delbecque and Chaban-Delmas. They were unwilling to let the Soustelle faction become too powerful, and De Gaulle was also unwilling to have the parliament be too openly controlled by the right wing, in order to maintain its role in deceiving the people. Therefore, in this election, Soustelle did not form an open alliance with the extreme right-wing parties. In this election, the "Union for the New Republic" nominated 336 candidates independently, receiving 3,603,958 votes in the first round, accounting for 17.6% of the total votes, and winning nine seats. In the second round, it received 4,769,052 votes and won 179 seats, occupying a total of 188 seats.

    Independent Party: It is composed of the Independent Republican Party and the Independent Farmers' Party, also known as the Conservative Party or the Moderate Party. This is a thorough right-wing party. Domestically, it advocates suppressing the workers' movement, restricting democracy, and outlawing the Communist Party; internationally, it advocates anti-Sovietism and suppressing colonial national movements. When De Gaulle seized power in June of this year, the Independent Party played an active role as an accomplice. The party's General Secretary, Duchet, along with Soustelle, Bidault, and André Maurice, formed the "Anti-Marxist Center," implementing the policies of the extreme colonialist group. Binet, one of the leaders of the Independent Party, is currently the Minister of Finance in De Gaulle's government. Another leader, Paul Reynaud, served as the chairman of the "Constitutional Consultative Committee" in the formulation of the "Fifth Republic Constitution," making great efforts to consolidate De Gaulle's personal dictatorship. In the general election in January 1956, it won 93 seats, did not participate in the "Republican Front" government, but participated in the Gaillard government.

    In this National Assembly election, the Independent Party colluded with the "Union for the New Republic" in many constituencies. In the new parliament, the Independent Party occupies 120 seats.

    Popular Republican Movement: Founded in November 1944, it brands itself as a progressive Catholic party, but in reality, it is a reactionary party that obeys the Roman Curia. After May 1947, the Popular Republican Movement cooperated with the Socialist Party to form the so-called "Third Force" government. The party leaders, Bidault and Robert Schuman, held the position of Foreign Minister for a long time, implementing a foreign policy of selling out national interests and relying on the United States. The Popular Republican Movement is also a staunch defender of colonial interests. In May 1954, it resolutely opposed the ceasefire in Indochina. In the general election in January 1956, it won 73 seats and did not participate in the "Republican Front" government formed by the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party. After the Gaillard government collapsed in March of this year, Pierre Pflimlin, chairman of the Popular Republican Movement, organized the government. It was this government that handed over power to De Gaulle under the threat of the Algerian riots. In De Gaulle's government, Pflimlin, along with Mollet and Houphouët-Boigny, served as Ministers of State.

    After De Gaulle came to power, the Popular Republican Movement split. Bidault and some right-wing members of the party established the "Christian Democratic Party" on June 30th of this year. Its main program is to "resolve to maintain French Algeria and to resolve to maintain France's traditional interests and mission in all overseas territories." In this National Assembly election, the Popular Republican Movement won 44 seats, and the Christian Democratic Party won 13 seats.

    Socialist Party: Is a party in which petty-bourgeois elements are increasingly dominant, with employees and civil servants accounting for 45%, while industrial and factory workers account for only 24.3%. The number of party members has also decreased from more than 350,000 in the early post-war period to about 130,000 at present.

    After the general election in January 1956, the Socialist Party rejected the proposal of the French Communist Party to organize a People's Front government, and joined forces with the Radical Socialist Party to form a "Republican Front" government.

    After the Mollet government came to power, it violated its promises, surrendered to the extreme colonialists, continued the colonial war in Algeria, and launched an armed invasion of Egypt together with Britain.

    In De Gaulle's seizure of power, Mollet, the right-wing leader of the Socialist Party, played the role of an active accomplice. In this election to the National Assembly, he also tried his best to support De Gaulle. He hoped to use the banner of anti-communism to gain some benefits. But the result of the election was that the Socialist Party only got 40 seats, and the votes were also less than in 1956. But Mollet shamelessly excused himself by saying that the Socialist Party would become a "constructive opposition party."

    Shortly before this National Assembly election, a minority faction within the Socialist Party was dissatisfied with Mollet's policies and formally established the "Independent Socialist Party," with Depreux as secretary. Well-known figures such as Vedie, Chervy, and Daniel Mayer also joined the new party.

    法国的几个政党
    法国本土的国民议会选举已经正式收场，法国的右翼政党——“保卫新共和联盟”、独立党、人民共和党和社会党，依靠反动的选举法，也依靠它们相互间的勾结，霸占了法国国民议会中绝大多数议席。现在把这四个右翼政党的情况简单介绍如下。
    “保卫新共和联盟”成立于今年10月3日。它是由戴高乐的左右手、阿尔及利亚叛乱集团的政治领袖苏斯戴尔亲手组织的。实际上，它是个戴高乐的政党。这个“联盟”主要包括以下三个戴高乐的政治派系：1、德耳贝克的“共和国民议会”，2、“争取法兰西复兴联盟”，它的前身就是苏斯戴尔的“争取拯救和复兴法属阿尔及利亚联盟”（成立于1956年），3、沙邦—戴尔马的“争取第五共和国公民联盟”。戴高乐的其他派系，如“支持戴高乐将军行动全国协会”、“争取共和改革中心”，未曾参加。苏斯戴尔为了扩大这个联盟的右派倾向，同皮杜尔、摩里斯和杜协有着密切联系。由于内部矛盾，苏斯戴尔未出任“联盟”总书记，而是由罗歇·弗雷担任。由十三人组成联盟“指导委员会”，委员中有苏斯戴、尔德耳贝克、沙邦—戴尔马等。
    “联盟”政纲明确指出，它“忠实于戴高乐将军”，并为实现所谓“戴高乐主义”而奋斗，是作为戴高乐的“有力助手”。它竭力把自己打扮成“中间集团”，和政治上的“平衡”力量。实际上，戴高乐打算以此为基础建立起单一“政党”的政府。
    “联盟”内部存在着严重矛盾。在这次选举中，苏斯戴尔和德耳贝克、沙邦—戴尔马之间争权夺利吵嚷不休。苏斯戴尔力图把自己的心腹人安插到议会里去的做法，遭到了德耳贝克和沙邦—戴尔马的反对。他们不愿苏斯戴尔派过于得势，而戴高乐也不愿议会过分露骨地掌握在右翼手中，以便保持其欺骗人民的作用。因此，在这次大选中，苏斯戴尔未曾与极右翼政党结成公开联盟。“保卫新共和联盟”在这次大选中，单独提出了三百三十六名候选人，在第一轮投票中得到了三百六十万三千九百五十八票，占整个选票的17.6％，得到九个议席。第二轮中得到四百七十六万九千零五十二票，得到一百七十九席；一共霸占了一百八十八个议席。
    独立党  它是由独立共和党和独立农民党组成的，也称作保守党或温和派。这是一个道地的右翼政党。它对内主张镇压工人运动，限制民主，取缔共产党；对外主张反苏，镇压殖民地民族运动。今年6月，戴高乐夺取政权时，独立党起了积极的帮凶作用。党的总书记杜协和苏斯戴尔、皮杜尔、安德烈·摩里斯，结成“反马克思主义中心”，执行极端殖民主义集团的政策。独立党的领导人之一比内，现任戴高乐政府财政部长，另一领导人保罗·雷诺，在“第五共和国宪法”的制订中，曾任“宪法咨询委员会”主席，为巩固戴高乐的个人独裁出了很大的力。1956年1月大选中，曾得九十三个议席，未参加“共和阵线”政府，但参加了盖伊阿政府。
    在这次国民议会选举中，独立党在许多选区和“保卫新共和联盟”勾结一起。在新的议会中，独立党占了一百二十席。
    人民共和党  1944年11月成立，自己标榜是进步的天主教党，实际上是听命于罗马教廷的反动政党。1947年5月以后，人民共和党与社会党合作，组织所谓“第三种力量”政府，这个党的领袖皮杜尔和罗伯特·舒曼二人长期占据外交部长职位，执行出卖民族利益、投靠美国的外交政策。人民共和党也是殖民利益坚决的维护者。1954年5月，它坚决反对印度支那停战，在1956年1月大选中，获得七十三席，未曾参加社会党和激进社会党合组的“共和阵线”政府。今年3月，盖伊阿政府垮台后，人民共和党主席弗林姆兰组织政府，就是这个政府在阿尔及利亚暴乱威胁之下，把政权让给了戴高乐。在戴高乐政府内，弗林姆兰和摩勒、乌弗埃·博瓦尼一起分任国务部长。
    戴高乐上台后，人民共和党内起了分裂。皮杜尔和党内的一些右派在今年6月30日成立了“天主教民主党”，它的主要纲领是“决意保持法属阿尔及利亚并决意在一切海外属地维护法国的传统利益和使命。”在这次国民议会选举中，人民共和党得四十四席，天主教民主党得十三席。
    社会党  是一个小资产阶级成分愈来愈占优势的政党，职员和公务员占45％，而工业和工厂的工人只占24.3％。党员人数也从战后初期的三十五万多人减至目前的十三万人左右。
    1956年1月大选后，社会党拒绝法共提出的组织人民阵线政府的建议，而同激进社会党联合组成“共和阵线”政府。
    摩勒政府上台后便违背自己的诺言，向极端殖民主义者投降，在阿尔及利亚继续进行殖民战争，并同英国一道对埃及发动武装侵略。
    在戴高乐夺取政权中，社会党右翼头子摩勒担任了积极帮凶的角色。在这次国民议会的选举中，他也竭力为戴高乐捧场。他希望用反共的旗帜来捞取一把。但是选举的结果，社会党只得到四十席，而且选票也比1956年少了。但是摩勒还无耻地自我解嘲地说，社会党将成为“建设性反对党”。
    在这次国民议会选举前不久，社会党内的少数派不满摩勒的政策，正式成立了“独立社会党”，由德普勒出任书记，参加这个新党的人还有维迪埃、沙瓦里、丹尼埃·麦耶等著名人士。
