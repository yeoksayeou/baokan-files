　　The Second “Great Initiative”
　　—Visiting the First Communist Labor Brigade in the Soviet Union
　　By our reporter Cui Yongchang

　　The railway from Moscow to Ryazan is not long, only a little over two hundred kilometers, but the Moscow marshalling station on this railway bears a very important task. Not only does it have to ensure the freight transport of the entire line, but it is also responsible for the repair work of all locomotives. Thirty-nine years ago, workers at this marshalling station began the first communist voluntary Saturday labor. At that time, twenty-four workers voluntarily worked overtime after work to repair locomotives urgently needed for the revolution. This spirit of selfless devotion was called a "great initiative" by Lenin and quickly spread throughout the country. Lenin said that this "communist voluntary Saturday labor is exceptionally valuable because it is the practical beginning of communism." (Emphasis in the original) (Lenin's Collected Works, Chinese Edition, Vol. 29, p. 388)

　　Thirty-nine years later, the Moscow marshalling station of the Moscow-Ryazan Railway has become the source of a new mass labor competition movement. Inspired by the grand program of the Seven-Year Plan proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the workers of this marshalling station proposed the initiative to strive to become communist labor brigades, which can be said to be another great initiative.

　　On a winter morning in Moscow, we arrived at this marshalling station. It is located in the southeast district of Moscow. The marshalling station's office is a three-story building. After entering the gate, we first saw a memorial room for the "Great Initiative." In this small room, there are reproductions of the manuscript of Lenin's great work and photos of the voluntary labor thirty-nine years ago. In the Party Committee office on the second floor, the secretary of the marshalling station Party Committee, Ji Liaoxin, introduced us to the birth and current development of the communist labor brigade. This Party Committee secretary is a soldier who was discharged from the army only two years ago. He still reluctantly wears his military uniform. He worked here as a turner more than twenty years ago.

　　The initiative to strive to become a communist labor brigade was born as follows: As early as three months ago, when the communique of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was published in the newspapers, everyone was very excited to hear that the 21st Party Congress would be held to discuss the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan. The roller bearing repair workshop (now renamed the diesel locomotive repair workshop) was particularly lively, because it was a youth workshop famous throughout the station. Many people said that in order to welcome the 21st Party Congress and the first Seven-Year Plan, new conditions for socialist labor competition should be proposed. But some people said, "Our country has entered the stage of large-scale construction of a communist society, and proposing socialist competition conditions is too low. We should propose communist labor competition conditions." At that time, someone immediately raised the question: "What should be the difference between communist labor competition conditions and socialist labor competition conditions?" So everyone answered this question according to their own views. Some people said: "Production targets should be higher"; some people said: "More rationalization proposals should be made"; some people said: "Since communist conditions are proposed, then everyone should not only perform well in production, but also play a communist exemplary role in life"... After learning about this situation, the workshop's Party group leader and Youth League group leader immediately convened a joint meeting of the Party and Youth League groups. The meeting was very lively, and everyone's opinions can be expressed in one sentence: Since we propose communist labor competition conditions, we should work, study, and live with the spirit of communism!

　　The workshop Party group leader, Brekhov, told us: "After the joint meeting of the workshop Party and Youth League groups, I immediately ran to the Party Committee. On behalf of the seven Communist Party members in our workshop, I suggested launching a movement to strive to become a communist labor brigade in the workshop. Party Committee Secretary Ji Liaoxin expressed complete agreement. The next day, a general meeting of all workers in the workshop began."

　　All fifty-seven workers in the workshop participated in that day's meeting. The marshalling station's printed newspaper, "The First Communist Voluntary Saturday Labor Day," reported the meeting in detail. Now we will excerpt a few excerpts from the meeting records here.

　　Brekhov was the first to speak, saying: "Because our workers have a certain communist consciousness, and we have advanced technical equipment in our hands, I suggest greatly shortening the repair time of locomotives, completing eight hours of work in seven hours every day, and using the last hour to help the tool workshop manufacture the equipment and rigging we need."

　　Worker Matveyenko said: "Now every Soviet worker should have the cultural level of a secondary technical school. I suggest that everyone in our workshop graduate from a secondary technical school or vocational school within a few years. This is the requirement of current work."

　　Bregson suggested that all workers participate in the rationalization proposal group, and Lebedev suggested that everyone come to train apprentices.

　　Workshop engineer Volkovsky said: "We are advancing towards communism, and this should also be reflected in our lives. We must not only fight against all capitalist remnants, but everyone must also play a communist exemplary role in life."

　　After a long discussion, everyone unanimously passed the following resolution: In production, the overhaul time of locomotives will be shortened from seventy-two hours to fifty-six hours, and the minor repair time will be shortened from twenty-four hours to sixteen hours. Each person will propose at least one rationalization proposal before the 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, saving the state 60,000 rubles of funds. In terms of learning, every worker should obtain a secondary technical education level within three to five years, and train apprentices well. In life, everyone should continuously improve their communist consciousness and fight against all capitalist remnants in life. The locomotive repair workshop also challenged all workshops in the marshalling station.

　　This resolution was formally passed on October 13. What are the initial results now? Party Committee Secretary Ji Liaoxin and the captain of the first working team of the workshop, Gutkov, answered this question. They said: In the past month, the workers' labor enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high. The average overhaul time of locomotives is 17.5 hours, and the minor repair only takes 9.1 hours. Bregson alone has put forward more than 20 rationalization proposals. The entire workshop has saved the state 63,500 rubles in funds due to the adoption of rationalization proposals. In terms of learning, 30 people have learned diesel locomotive repair work, and 22 young workers are preparing for the entrance examination of the secondary railway technical school. Recently, the workers' collectivist spirit has been greatly promoted, and incidents of mutual help and encouragement have emerged one after another. Old worker Shirokov excitedly told reporters: "Now the work is really exciting. Although I am almost sixty years old, my mood is the same as that of a twenty-something Communist Youth League member." The young men in the workshop also joked that Shirokov is the most active Communist Youth League member in the workshop.

　　Of course, the development of the movement was not all smooth sailing. Some workers still had difficulties in thinking, which required the help of the collective. For example, the young worker Pavlyudekin, who specializes in repairing coal and water car axle boxes, was like this. He is only seventeen years old, but he doesn't like to study and is very interested in football. He also works like a little bull. When the workshop passed the competition resolution, he agreed with everything, but he didn't agree to go to elementary school to make up for his lessons. Later, Belov, the secretary of the workshop's Communist Youth League group, learned about the situation. It turned out that it was because he was tall and didn't want to sit with some elementary school students to study those elementary school textbooks. The Youth League group leader said to him: "Now everyone in the workshop is studying, even the gray-haired Shirokov is studying. You have very good skills in repairing old locomotives, but it is difficult to repair diesel locomotives. There will be newer locomotives in the future. If you don't study, you won't be able to work." Later, the Youth League group found a few young workers to go to school with him and transferred them to another class, and the problem was solved.

　　November 26 was a day worth remembering forever for the workshop. That afternoon, the workers were participating in an open meeting of the workshop's Party group to summarize the initial results of the communist labor competition. Ye Losin, the secretary of the marshalling station's Youth League organization, ran over breathlessly and said: "Comrades, I have good news to report to you. I just came back from a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League asked me to tell everyone that your working team has been officially named the first communist labor brigade in the Soviet Union!"

　　The next day, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union, Shemichastny, personally came to the workshop to congratulate everyone and encouraged them to make persistent efforts and achieve greater results in the communist labor competition.

　　The captain of the working team, Gutkov, is a very kind person. He is always unhurried when talking to you and patiently explains the current work situation of the working team. He said: "Now our burden is heavier, because outstanding working teams from all over the country are challenging us. Their competition conditions are higher than one another. Of course, we are not afraid of high conditions, because those who have obtained the title of communist labor brigade will be the ones who can work hardest for communism. But we must also move forward forever in order to maintain our honor."

　　Indeed, now the movement to strive to become a communist labor brigade is becoming more and more widespread in the Soviet Union. Now this movement is not only being carried out in factories, but also in collective farms. Many factories and mining enterprises have also proposed striving for the entire factory to become a communist labor unit. All of this shows the unparalleled enthusiasm of the Soviet people for building communism. The movement to strive to become a communist labor brigade is a manifestation of this enthusiasm.

    第二个“伟大的创举”
    ——访苏联第一个共产主义劳动工作队
    本报记者  崔永昌
    从莫斯科到梁赞的铁路并不长，它只有二百多公里，但是这条铁路的莫斯科调车站却担负着相当重要的任务，这里不只要保证全线的货运，并且还要负责所有机车的修理工作。三十九年前这个调车站的工人开始了第一个共产主义星期六义务劳动，当时有二十四个工人在下班以后自动加班修理为革命迫切需要的机车，这种舍己为公的精神被列宁称为“伟大的创举”，并且很快普及全国。列宁说这种“共产主义星期六义务劳动所以异常宝贵，因为它是共产主义的实际开端。”（重点为原有）（列宁全集，中文版第29卷，第388页）
    三十九年后的今天，莫斯科—梁赞铁路莫斯科调车站又成了一个新的群众劳动竞赛运动的发源地，这个调车站的工人在苏共中央提出的七年计划的宏伟纲领的鼓舞下，提出了争取做共产主义劳动工作队的倡议，这可以说是又一个伟大的创举。
    在莫斯科一个冬天的早晨，我们来到了这个调车站，它座落在莫斯科的东南区，调车站的办事处是一座三层楼房，走进大门以后，我们首先看到了一个“伟大的创举”的纪念室，在这间不大的房子里悬挂着列宁这一伟大著作的手稿复制品和三十九年前的义务劳动的照片。在二楼的党委办公室里，调车站党委书记季辽新向我们介绍了共产主义劳动工作队的诞生经过和目前的发展概况。这位党委书记是两年前才退伍的军人，到现在还恋恋不舍地穿着军衣，他在二十几年前在这里当过旋工。
    争取做共产主义劳动工作队的倡议是这样诞生的：还在三个月以前，当报纸上公布了苏共中央九月全会公报以后，大家听说要召开第二十一次党代表大会讨论七年计划控制数字，都非常兴奋，滚柱修理车间（现在已改为内燃机车修理车间）更是特别热闹，因为这是全站闻名的青年车间。许多人都说，为了迎接党的第二十一次代表大会和第一个七年计划，应当提出新的社会主义劳动竞赛条件：但是有人说。我们国家已经进入大规模建设共产主义社会的阶段了，提社会主义竞赛条件太低了，应该提共产主义劳动竞赛条件。当时马上就有人提出了问题：“共产主义劳动竞赛条件与社会主义劳动竞赛条件应该有什么区别？”于是大家全按照自己的看法回答这一问题，有人说：“生产指标应当高一些”；有人说：“要多提合理化建议”；有人说：“既然提共产主义条件，那么每个人不只要在生产中表现好，并且在生活中也应当起共产主义的模范作用”……车间的党小组长和团小组长了解到这个情况后马上召开党团小组联合会议，这个会开得非常热闹，大家的意见可以用一句话表示出来：既然提共产主义的劳动竞赛条件，就应当用共产主义的精神来工作，学习和生活！
    车间党小组长布雷可夫向我们说：“车间党团小组联合会开完以后，我马上跑到党委会去，我代表我们车间的七个共产党员建议在车间中展开争取做共产主义劳动工作队的运动，党委书记季辽新表示完全同意。第二天车间全体工人大会就开始了。”
    这个车间的五十七个工人，全都参加了那天的会议。调车站的铅印小报“第一个共产主义星期六义务劳动日”详细地报道了会议的情况，现在我们把当时的发言记录摘几条写在这里。
    布雷可夫首先发言说：“因为我们工人有着一定的共产主义觉悟，并且在我们手中又有先进的技术设备，我建议大大缩短机车的修理时间，每天八小时的工作用七小时完成，最后的一小时帮助工具车间制造我们需要的装备索具。”
    工人马特维言科说：“现在每个苏联工人都应当具有中等技术学校的文化水平，我建议几年内我们全车间每个人都在中等技术学校或专科学校毕业。这是目前工作的要求。”
    布雷格森建议全体工人都参加合理化建议小组，列别节夫建议大家全来带徒弟。
    车间工程师渥尔阔夫斯基说：“我们在向共产主义前进，这一点在我们的生活中也应当有所表现，我们不但要与一切资本主义的残余作斗争，并且每个人在生活中也要起共产主义的模范作用。”
    经过长久的讨论，大家一致通过了这样一个决议：在生产上把机车的大修时间由七十二小时缩到五十六小时，小修的时间由二十四小时缩到十六小时，每人在苏共第二十一次党代表大会以前至少提出一条合理化建议，为国家节省六万卢布资金。在学习上，每个工人都应在三五年内取得中等技术教育水平，并且带好学徒；在生活上，每个工人都应不断提高自己的共产主义觉悟，在生活中与一切资本主义残余作斗争。机车修理车间并且向调车站所有车间挑战。
    这项决议是在10月13日正式通过的，现在的初步战果如何呢？党委书记季辽新和车间第一工作队队长古特阔夫回答了这个问题，他们说：一个月来，工人的劳动情绪是空前高涨的，机车的大修时间平均是十七点五小时，小修只用九点一小时，合理化建议仅只布雷格森一人就提了二十多条。整个车间由于采用了合理化建议，为国家已经节省了资金六万三千五百卢布。在学习上，已经有三十人学会了内燃机车修理工作，还有二十二个青年工人在准备中等铁路技术学校的入学考试。近来工人的集体主义精神大大发扬，彼此帮助，互相鼓励的事层出不穷。老工人席洛可夫兴奋地告诉记者说：“现在的工作真带劲，我虽然快六十了，但是情绪上跟二十几岁的共青团员一样。”车间的小伙子们也开着玩笑说，席洛可夫是车间中最活泼的一个共青团员。
    当然，在运动的发展过程中也不是一帆风顺的，有些工人在思想上也还有想不通的地方，这就需要集体的帮助。例如专门修理煤水车轴承座的青年工人巴甫留得金就是这样。他才十七岁，但是就不喜欢念书，对足球满感兴趣，工作上也像头小牛一样。当车间通过竞赛的决议以后，他什么全同意，就是不同意到小学去补习功课。后来车间共青团小组长别洛夫了解了一下情况，原来是因为他个子大，不愿意与一些小学生坐在一起念那些小学课本。团小组长向他说：“现在车间里的人全学习了，连白头发的席洛可夫也在学习。你修旧机车的技术很好，但是修内燃机车就困难，以后还会有更新的机车，不学习就连工作也作不成了。”后来团小组又找了几个青年工人与他一起上学，并且把他们调到另外一个班，这问题才算解决了。
    11月26日，对车间来说是一个值得永远纪念的日子。这天下午工人们正在参加车间党小组的公开会议，总结共产主义劳动竞赛的初步成绩，调车站团组织书记叶洛新气喘呼呼地跑来说：“同志们，我报告你们一个好消息，我刚从团中央开会回来，团中央委员会要我转告大家，你们的工作队已经被正式命名为全苏联第一个共产主义劳动工作队了！”
    第二天，苏联共青团中央委员会第一书记谢米恰斯内伊亲自来到车间向大家祝贺，并且勉励他们，再接再厉，在共产主义的劳动竞赛中取得更大的成绩。
    工作队队长古特阔夫是一个非常和蔼的人，他和你谈话时总是那样不慌不忙，并且耐心地解释着工作队目前的工作情况，他说：“目前我们的担子更重了，因为全国各地的优秀工作队都向我们挑战，他们的竞赛条件一个比一个高，当然我们并不怕条件高，因为得到共产主义劳动工作队称号的将是最能为共产主义努力的人，但是我们也必须永远前进，以便保持住我们的荣誉。”
    的确，现在在苏联争取做共产主义劳动工作队的运动愈来愈广泛了，现在不但在工厂，并且在农庄也展开了这一运动，许多厂矿企业还提出了争取全厂成为共产主义劳动单位。而这一切都表明了苏联人民建设共产主义的无比热情，争取做共产主义劳动工作队的运动就是这种热情的表现。
