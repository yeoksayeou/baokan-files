    “The Great Leap Forward in China's industrial and agricultural production in 1958 was a great practice. Through this practice, we not only found a broad road to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but also gained rich experience on this broad road. This makes it possible for us not only to continue the leap forward in 1959, but also to leap forward even better.” (Communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China)
    We plan to publish a series of political commentaries to sing praises of and depict this broad road from various aspects, and record our magnificent steps forward on this broad road. —Editor

    Rising Sun in the East
    Tan Zhenlin

    Just as the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party stated, the people's commune, like the newly born sun in the East, shines brightly as soon as it emerges; it is also like the first artificial satellite of the Soviet Union, attracting widespread attention as soon as it appears. All socialist countries and all peace-loving people are concerned about the progress of China's people's commune movement with great excitement. Some of them still have doubts of one kind or another due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation, but they all hold a passion and hope that this new social organization form of China's people's commune can develop healthily. However, there is another group of people, including Dulles of the United States to the revisionists of Yugoslavia, who, upon seeing the emergence of the people's commune, seem to have seen a "death warrant," fearing it to death. They regard our people's commune as a major disaster for them. They gnash their teeth and curse the people's commune, both fearful and hateful. From this point, we can also understand that the emergence of the people's commune will accelerate the speed of China's socialist construction, thereby strengthening the strength of the entire socialist camp. All this is very unfavorable to the likes of Dulles and all reactionaries. As Chairman Mao said at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: "The enemy is rotting away day by day, while we are getting better day by day."

    The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" points out: "The emergence of the people's commune is not accidental. It is the product of China's economic and political development, the product of the Party's socialist rectification movement, the general line of socialist construction, and the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1958." China's revolution has been carried out under the correct leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have firmly grasped the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution, guiding China's revolution to advance one after another. There is no Great Wall separating, nor is it allowed to separate, the previous stage of the revolution from the next. The process of our country's rural areas from mutual aid teams to people's communes in the past ten years also fully illustrates this point.

    After the completion of land reform, a prosperous phenomenon appeared in the countryside, and agricultural production quickly recovered to pre-war levels. In this recovery process, in order to more fully develop the productive forces and eliminate polarization, the peasants established mutual aid organizations on the basis of the original habit of exchanging labor and mutual assistance. Our Party timely seized this demand of the peasants and made a resolution on mutual aid and cooperation. This resolution was immediately supported by the vast majority of peasants, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement developed rapidly. All experiences have proven to the peasants that agricultural production mutual aid teams are superior to individual farming, and agricultural production cooperatives are superior to mutual aid teams. Faced with this objective fact, the peasants were even more encouraged to have the courage to move forward boldly and the determination to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. By the spring and summer of 1955, elementary agricultural production cooperatives had become the main form of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in a considerable area.

    At this time, a "bound feet woman" error once appeared. They attempted to "cut" tens of thousands of agricultural production cooperatives. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong timely seized the objective situation of the great development of cooperation, seriously and sharply criticized the "bound feet woman" error, and timely made a resolution on the development of agricultural production cooperatives. This resolution was immediately supported by the vast number of peasants across the country. In less than half a year, the country realized agricultural cooperation and basically completed the transition from elementary to advanced cooperatives.

    On the basis of the socialist rectification movement of the whole people, a new upsurge of socialist construction began last winter. This upsurge is to push agricultural production to a stage of leaping development. The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party systematically summarized the general line of socialist construction, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the whole Party and the whole people for socialist construction. The upsurge of the whole Party running industry, the whole people running industry, and the townships and communities running industry converged with the upsurge of agricultural production. The mutual support initiated by farmers to overcome waterlogging and drought, breaking through the boundaries of communities, townships, and counties, bringing their own tools, food, and grass, not caring about remuneration, this kind of socialist large-scale collaboration, and the vigorous development of township and community industries, as well as the leap forward in agricultural production, all require mobilizing manpower, material resources, and financial resources on a larger scale, and also require that our commercial, taxation, education, and other undertakings in rural areas must suit the changed situation. The development of productive forces will inevitably lead to changes in production relations. The peasants themselves are changing the original production relations, so "communist communes," "state-owned farms," "collective farms," "large cooperatives," "people's communes," and many other new organizational forms emerged in the rural areas of the country between this summer and autumn. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong timely seized this new situation and made a resolution on the development of people's communes at the Beidaihe Conference in August this year, unifying the numerous new organizations into this best organizational form and name—the people's commune.

    From such a brief review, we can understand that the people's commune is not an accidental phenomenon, not something that can be done according to people's subjective demands, but reflects an objective law of development, that is, the production relations must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces. The reason why socialist production relations do not cause direct conflicts with the productive forces is because the Party has grasped this law and timely adjusts the production relations to suit the development of productive forces. The people's commune organization is precisely a result of the development requirements of the productive forces at the present stage in our country requiring changes in production relations. It is a fetus conceived by this law as the mother. Naturally, the birth of a social law fetus is not exactly the same as the birth of a human fetus. It will not necessarily land on a certain day and time, but it must be under certain conditions, that is, under the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party that is good at correctly grasping the objective development situation, it will be born smoothly. Without this condition, even if there is this objective situation, it still cannot be born. Of course, the emergence of people's communes in our country fully reflects our country's specific situation. Our country is a large country with a population of 600 million that is poor and blank. The people demand to get rid of this poverty quickly, and they do not hesitate to build the motherland with their selfless labor, and the people's commune is precisely the best organizational form that can most effectively organize our country's manpower and material resources for socialist construction.

    This people's commune, like the rising sun, has infinite vitality. At present, it is the basic-level organization of China's socialist social structure, and in the future, when it comes to communist society, it will still be the basic-level organization of the social structure. At the present stage, it not only undertakes the task of transitioning the people's commune from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in the next few years, but also undertakes the task of laying the foundation for the transition to communism. The people's commune must strive to develop production, and whether for the present or for the future, it needs to greatly promote the development of productive forces. The establishment of the people's commune is also due to the agricultural leap forward this year and the emergence of township and community industries, that is, due to the development of productive forces. Without the development of productive forces, everything about the transition to ownership by the whole people and the transition to communism is empty talk. A few places hastily announced that they are owned by the whole people, and even said that they will immediately enter communism, which is incorrect. This precisely shows that the comrades there have not seriously studied the resolution of the Beidaihe Conference of the Central Political Bureau on the establishment of people's communes. That resolution made clear instructions on the conditions for the transfer from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism. These comrades do not understand that enterprises owned by the whole people, like state-owned enterprises, can directly have their means of production and products uniformly distributed by the state. However, people's communes, which are still collectively owned at the present stage, cannot yet do these things. Therefore, the conditions are not yet ripe, so ownership should not be changed casually, but efforts should be made to create conditions, first of all, to strive to develop production, so that the development of production gradually approaches the production level of state-owned industries.

    The rising sun has already risen from the horizon in the cheers of the people. Our task is to consolidate it, develop it, and make this prodigy of the Great Leap Forward grow up healthily, and become a pillar of communism in the future. As for the enemy's rumors and slanders, we don't take them seriously at all. Anyway, their days are numbered!

    “1958年我国工农业生产大跃进，是一个伟大的实践。通过这个实践，我们不但找到了一条多快好省地建设社会主义的康庄大道，并且在这条康庄大道上取得了丰富的经验。这就使得我们不但有可能在1959年继续跃进，并且有可能跃进得更好。”（中国共产党第八届中央委员会第六次全体会议公报）
    我们准备陆续发表一批政论，从各个方面来歌颂和描绘这条康庄大道，记下我们前进在这条康庄大道上的雄伟的步伐。  ——编者
    旭日东升  
    谭震林
    正像党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”所说的，人民公社，像东方初生的太阳，一出来，就光芒四射；它又像苏联第一颗人造卫星，一出来，就引起了人们普遍的注意。所有的社会主义国家和一切爱好和平的人们，都以极其兴奋的心情关心我国人民公社运动的进展，他们中有一些人由于不了解实情，还存在着这样或那样的疑问，可是，他们都是抱着一股热情，希望我国人民公社这个新的社会组织形式，能够健康地发展起来。但是，另外有一伙人，包括从美国的杜勒斯到南斯拉夫的修正主义者，他们见到人民公社的出现，好像见到了“催命符”一样，害怕得要死，把我们的人民公社看成是他们的一场大灾难，他们对人民公社咬牙切齿破口大骂，又害怕又痛恨。从这一点，我们也可以理解到，人民公社的出现，将加快我国社会主义建设的速度，从而也就加强了整个社会主义阵营的力量。这些对杜勒斯之流的一切反动派说来，都是很不妙的。正如毛主席在党的八届六中全会上所说的一样：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。”
    “关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出：“人民公社的出现不是偶然的，它是我国经济和政治发展的产物，是党的社会主义整风运动、社会主义建设总路线和1958年社会主义建设大跃进的产物。”我国的革命，是在党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下进行的，党和毛泽东同志紧紧掌握了马克思列宁主义的不断革命的理论，指导了我国革命一个接一个前进。在前一个革命阶段与后一个革命阶段之间，没有隔着、也不允许隔着一道万里长城。我国农村近十年来从互助组到人民公社的过程，也充分说明这一点。
    在土地改革完成之后，农村出现了欣欣向荣的现象，农业生产迅速恢复到战前的水平。在这个恢复过程中，农民为了更充分发展生产力，和杜绝向两极分化，在原有的变耕互助习惯的基础上，建立了互助组织，我们党及时地抓住了农民这个要求，作出了互助合作决议，这个决议立即受到了绝大多数农民的拥护，互助合作运动迅速地发展起来了。所有经验都向农民证明了农业生产互助组比单干优越，农业生产合作社又比互助组优越。在这个客观事实前面，更鼓舞了农民大胆前进的勇气和走互助合作道路的决心。到了1955年春夏之间，初级农业生产合作社在相当大的地区内，就已经成为互助合作组织的主要形式了。
    在这时候，曾经出现了一种“小脚女人”的错误。他们企图把成千上万的农业生产合作社“砍”掉。党中央和毛泽东同志及时抓住了合作化大发展的这个客观形势，严肃地尖锐地批判了“小脚女人”的错误，及时作出了发展农业生产合作社的决议，这个决议立即受到了全国广大农民的拥护，不到半年时间，全国就实现了农业合作化，基本上完成了从初级社到高级社的过渡。
    在社会主义的全民整风运动的基础上，从去冬开始了新的社会主义建设高潮，这个高潮要把农业生产推上一个飞跃发展的阶段。党的八大二次会议系统地总结了社会主义建设总路线，大大地鼓舞了全党全民社会主义建设的积极性，全党办工业、全民办工业、乡社办工业的热潮与农业生产高潮汇流了。农民为了战胜水旱灾害所掀起的冲破社界、乡界、县界的互相支援，自带工具粮草，不计较报酬，这种社会主义大协作，和蓬勃发展的乡社工业，以及农业生产的跃进，都要求在更大范围内调动人力、物力、财力，而且要求我们在农村的商业、税收、教育等事业必须适合已经变化了的情况。生产力的发展必然要引起生产关系的变化。农民自己动手改变着原有的生产关系，于是，“共产主义公社”，“国营农场”，“集体农庄”，“大合作社”，“人民公社”等等名目繁多的新的组织形式，今年夏秋之间就在全国农村涌现出来了。党中央和毛泽东同志及时抓住了这个新形势，在今年八月北戴河会议上作出了关于发展人民公社的决议，把名目繁多的新的组织统一于这个最好的组织形式和名称——人民公社。
    从这样一个简短的回忆中，我们就可以了解，人民公社不是偶然的现象，不是按照人们主观要求，想怎样作就可以怎样作的，而是反映了一个客观的发展法则，这个法则就是生产关系必须适合生产力的性质。社会主义的生产关系之所以不会引起和生产力的直接冲突，就是因为党掌握了这个法则，及时地调整生产关系，使之适合生产力发展。人民公社这个组织，正是我国现阶段生产力的发展要求生产关系的改变而产生的，它是以这个法则作为母体所孕育的一个胎儿。自然，社会法则的胎儿的出生，和人的胎儿出生不完全一样，它不是到了某月某日某时非落地不可，而是要在一定的条件下，也就是说要在一个善于正确掌握客观发展形势的马克思列宁主义的政党的领导下，才会顺利的出世的。缺少了这个条件，那么，即使有了这种客观形势，它还是生不出来的。当然，人民公社之在我国出现，是完全反映了我国的具体情况，我国是一个一穷二白的六万万人口的大国，人民要求迅速摆脱这种贫困状态，他们不惜以自己的忘我劳动来建设祖国，而人民公社则正是能够最有效地把我国的人力物力组织起来进行社会主义建设的最好的组织形式。
    这个像初升的太阳般的人民公社，是有无限的生命力的。它在目前，是我国社会主义社会结构的基层组织，而在将来，到了共产主义社会，它将仍然是社会结构的基层组织。在现阶段，它既担负了今后若干年内使人民公社由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的任务，又担负了为着过渡到共产主义打下基础的任务。人民公社必须努力发展生产，不管是为了目前或为了将来，都需要大大促进生产力的发展。就是人民公社的建立也是因为今年出现了农业大跃进，出现了乡社办工业，也就是说，由于生产力的发展而引起的。没有生产力的发展，什么过渡到全民所有制，什么过渡到共产主义都是空话。有个别地方，匆忙地宣布自己是全民所有制，甚至说要立即进入共产主义，这是不正确的。这恰恰说明了那里的同志们没有认真研究中央政治局北戴河会议关于建立人民公社的决议。那个决议对从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，和从社会主义过渡到共产主义的条件都作了明确的指示。我们这些同志不懂得，全民所有制的企业，要像国营企业那样，它的生产资料和产品可以直接由国家统一分配，而现阶段还是集体所有制的人民公社，却还作不到这些，因此条件还不成熟，就不应随便改变所有制，而要努力创造条件，首先是努力发展生产，使生产的发展逐步接近国营工业的生产水平。
    旭日已经在万众欢呼声中从地平线上升起来了。我们的任务，就是要巩固它，发展它，使这个大跃进的麟儿茁壮地长大，到将来成为共产主义的栋梁之材。至于敌人的造谣污蔑，我们根本不放在眼里，反正他们的日子已经没有多少了！
