Delivering the "Scripture" to the Door
    Zhang Ke

Recently, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in rural areas have been sending personnel to help people's communes run canteens. This fact once again illustrates that the People's Army, under the leadership and education of the Party, takes the interests of the broad masses as the premise in all its actions. As long as it is beneficial to the people, they will spare no effort to do it well, regardless of hardship or fatigue. Truly, the People's Army is everywhere for the people. The development of this movement by the People's Liberation Army will play a significant role in improving public canteens and consolidating and enhancing the people's communes.

Running rural public canteens well is a major matter concerning the lives of 500 million peasants, and leaders at all levels attach great importance to it. However, because the canteens were established not long ago, the equipment is poor, and in particular, everyone lacks experience in this area. Although cadres and the masses have made continuous efforts and come up with some methods to run some canteens well, there are still some public canteens that have not been run well and are seeking "scripture" everywhere. Under these circumstances, it is a great thing that the People's Army takes the initiative to deliver their years of accumulated experience to the door. This will not only help those canteens that have not been run well to quickly improve but also add icing to the cake for those that are doing relatively well, making them even better.

When it comes to running public canteens, who has more experience than the People's Liberation Army! The People's Liberation Army not only has the longest history of running public canteens, but also can run them very well in various situations. For example, in the most difficult years of the war, material conditions were very poor, combat was frequent, and mobility was high, but their food was still very well managed, and the soldiers were very satisfied with their meals. The most important experience for them to be able to do this so well is to implement democratic management and economic transparency. From planning management and financial accounts to the specific arrangements for meals, they widely adopt the opinions of soldiers and absorb them into leadership and management, implementing a mass-run canteen. Because of this, the sense of responsibility of the vast number of soldiers has been greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm and creativity have been fully utilized, working together to run the canteen well. In practice, they have created a complete set of experiences in running canteens. Although the material conditions of the people's communes cannot be said to be very good, they are much better than the army canteens during the war. As long as we can make good use of their experience, the canteen will surely be run better and better.

The People's Commune's canteens are all over the rural areas of the country. It is of course impossible for the People's Liberation Army comrades to go everywhere to help. In addition to continuing to give play to the wisdom and strength of the masses and finding ways to improve the canteen, we can also use methods such as convening on-site meetings and organizing visits to introduce and disseminate the experience of the People's Liberation Army in running canteens, so that our canteens will all fly red flags and everyone will be satisfied.

    送“经”上门
    张克
    最近，驻农村的解放军部队，纷纷抽出人员帮助人民公社办食堂。这个事实，又一次说明了在党的领导和教养下的人民军队，他们的一举一动没有不是以广大群众的利益为前提的，只要是对人民群众有益的事情，他们总是不避艰苦、不怕劳累地尽力把它做好。真真是人民军队处处为人民。解放军这一运动的开展，对改进公共食堂、巩固和提高人民公社将起很大的作用。
    办好农村公共食堂是关系着五亿农民生活的大事，各地领导对此非常重视。但由于食堂建立不久，设备较差，特别是大家都缺乏这方面的经验，虽然经过干部和群众的不断努力，想出一些办法，办好了一些食堂，但仍然有一部分公共食堂还没有办好，正在四处求“经”。在这种情况下，人民军队把他们多少年积累起来的经验，主动送上门来，真是一件大好事情。这不但可以帮助那些还没有办好的食堂迅速办好，对于办得较好的食堂来一个锦上添花，办得更好。
    谈到办公共食堂，谁能比解放军的经验更多呢！解放军不仅办公共食堂的时间最长，而且在各种情况下都可以把食堂办得很好。比如在最艰苦的战争年代，物质条件很差，战斗频繁，流动性很大，而他们的伙食仍然办得很好，士兵吃得十分满意。他们所以能够办得这样好，最主要的一个经验便是实行民主管理，经济公开。他们从计划管理、财务账目以至饭菜的具体安排，都广泛采纳士兵的意见，并吸收他们参加领导管理，实行群众办食堂。由于这样，广大士兵的责任感大大增强，积极性和创造性充分发挥，群策群力，共同办好了食堂。在实际工作中，他们创造了一整套办食堂的经验。人民公社的物质条件虽然不能说很好，但比之战争时期的部队食堂，还是优越得多。只要我们能够很好地运用他们的经验，食堂一定会越办越好。
    人民公社的食堂遍布全国农村，解放军同志当然不可能处处都去帮助，各地除继续发挥群众的智慧和力量，想办法改进食堂外，还可以用召开现场会议、组织参观等办法，介绍和传播解放军办食堂的经验，使我们的食堂个个插红旗，人人都满意。
