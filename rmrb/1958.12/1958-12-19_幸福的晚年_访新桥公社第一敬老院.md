    A Happy Old Age
    ——A Visit to the First Respect-the-Aged Home of Xinqiao Commune
    By Our Correspondent Zhou Zhesheng
    On a quiet hillside covered with dense woods and surrounded by streams, stand two tall buildings. A red plaque hangs at the entrance, inscribed with the words: "Having endured all the suffering of the world in the past, today we live in halls of happiness, with good food, clothing, and a good life, forever grateful to the Communist Party." This is the First Respect-the-Aged Home of the Xinqiao Commune. One day in early December, I visited this home and saw the elderly people spending a peaceful and contented day in their happy old age.

    When I stepped into the Respect-the-Aged Home that morning, I saw that the courtyard was swept clean, and the walls were whitewashed bright. The recreation room was decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers, and filled with poems and paintings. On the central wall of the recreation room was a couplet: "In the past, bitter tears were swallowed in silence; now, we spend our twilight years in the Respect-the-Aged Home." The loudspeaker was broadcasting dramas and music. The Respect-the-Aged Home houses a total of seventeen elderly people who are without children, relatives, or means of support.

    The Respect-the-Aged Home has collective dormitories for men and women, as well as rooms for elderly couples. Comrade Cao Lanying, the director of the home, and I entered one of the rooms. The sunlight filled the room with brightness. A thick layer of straw was spread on the double bed. To the right of the bed was a table, on which were placed a kerosene lamp, a washbasin, and toiletries. Although the facilities were simple, it felt like a home. The owners of the room, Xia Zhengli and Cao Xia's wife, were warming themselves with charcoal hand warmers. I asked them how they came to the home and whether they were doing well. Xia Zhengli said, "My wife and I are both around seventy years old. We worked as hired laborers for most of our lives. Now that we are old and unable to work, and without children or relatives, we would probably have starved to death in the old society." At this point, Cao Xia's wife interjected, "The dilapidated house we lived in leaked when it rained and snowed. Now we are sheltered from the wind and rain. The straw on the bed is thick. When the old man entered the home, he received a padded pair of pants and a pair of padded shoes, making him look like a cotton ball." Across from their room was the room shared by Liu Xiaogen, who was in his seventies, and Li Shaoqing. Liu Xiaogen said that he and Li Shaoqing got along well and could talk about anything, so they asked to be together. Cao Lanying arranged for them to be in this room. Li Shaoqing said that the new cotton quilt on their bed and the padded clothes they were wearing were all issued by the Respect-the-Aged Home. Their original tattered quilts and clothes had been sent to the commune's museum. Cao Lanying told me that the eight quilts and more than ten sets of padded clothing bought by the commune had all been distributed to the elderly who lacked quilts and clothing.

    About twenty or thirty steps from the dormitory was the Respect-the-Aged Home's dining hall. The spacious dining room was furnished with four tables for eight, more than ten armchairs, and long benches, all neatly arranged. The cook, Xu Xiaodi, said that the furniture and cooking utensils in the home did not cost a penny; they were all donated by the commune members. It was lunchtime. Xia Zhengli and Wang Yucheng and their wives sat together at one table, and the rest of the people sat around the other three tables. Cao Lanying and Xu Xiaodi and two others each helped a blind elderly person to the dining hall, bringing the food to their hands. The people sitting at the same table picked vegetables from the dishes and put them into the blind person's bowl, vying to add more rice for them. That noon, there were three dishes and a soup: boiled greens, braised tofu, stir-fried pickles, and radish soup. The snow-white polished rice was hot and fragrant. I sat down next to Xu Xiaoying, an elderly blind woman. As she ate, she told me about her life: she lost her parents at a young age and became a child bride. Her husband and three children died one after another, leaving her alone in her old age. Her eyes were blinded by crying. She said, "In the past, I longed for myself to die early. After the Communist Party came, the poor people at the door of my house lived a better life, and more people took care of me. The government helped me, and the agricultural cooperative guaranteed my basic needs, but I was always uneasy. Comrade! After entering the Respect-the-Aged Home, I live well, wear well, eat well, and I am well taken care of. I won't mind even if I live to be a hundred years old here!" Yao Changbao, who was in his seventies, constantly took out a pink handkerchief given by the county civil affairs department to wipe the soup from his beard, smacking his lips and saying, "The soup is so delicious." He pointed to the large bowl in his hand and said to me, "At home, I was sometimes hungry, sometimes full, and the vegetables had salt but no oil. Now I have three hot meals a day." Yao Changbao had no children or relatives and had worked as a hired hand for landlords for more than forty years. When he was sick, he still had to work for the boss. He thought that when he became weak, wouldn't he just die in a temple or a cowshed! The old man stroked his white beard and said to me, "Thinking about the bitter days of the past, I can't stop crying. Looking at the life now, I can't help but smile in my sleep!"

    After lunch, the elderly people all sat in the square in front of the Respect-the-Aged Home, basking in the sun. Some were resting with their eyes closed, some were chatting, and some were telling jokes. Yao Sanmei and two other old women were making cotton shoes for the elderly, and Cao Lanying was also sewing cloth socks for the elderly. Someone suggested that Xu Xiaoxing, who was blind, tell stories from ancient books. Xu Xiaoxing told the story of "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger," and everyone listened intently. Yao Changbao, who was sitting next to me, said that when Xu Xiaoxing first entered the home, his old illness relapsed, and he could not get out of bed. When the meal was ready, everyone would first fill his bowl and bring it to his bedside. Every day, someone brought him tea and water, and emptied his chamber pot. Xu Xiaoxing was moved to tears by the care and attention that everyone gave him during his illness. He said excitedly, "I am an old man living alone. When I got sick, I couldn't even get a drink of water in the middle of the night. Now that I am in the home and have care, I wouldn't have been able to survive this illness!" These elderly people had all suffered cruel exploitation by landlords and rich peasants in the past, which made them weak and frail, and some were even disabled. They were all households with the "Five Guarantees" in the agricultural cooperative. Although their living expenses such as food, clothing, housing, and use were taken care of, they still had many difficulties in life because they had no one to take care of them at home. When they came to the home, they all had some minor illnesses. The Respect-the-Aged Home hired doctors to help them with treatment. The director and the cook brought them tea and water and even fed them. They also cared for each other. Now, all those who were sick have recovered, and everyone is healthy and happy. In addition, their lives are well-organized. Many of them have a ruddy complexion and have gained weight. "Seventeen old people live on the hillside, and the Respect-the-Aged Home has many side occupations. They grow their own greens and radishes, cut firewood, raise pigs, and make straw sandals." The elderly people use these words to describe their sideline production. Under the influence of the booming Great Leap Forward situation, although the home did not stipulate that they had to work, the elderly people still diligently did some work that they were capable of doing. Yao Sanmei and Qian Weishi went to cut pig grass every day, and the two piglets in the home each weighed more than seventy pounds. They planned to slaughter one for themselves during the Spring Festival and sell the other to the state, using the money from selling the pig to develop household poultry. The elderly people have planted the two-plus acres of vegetable garden in the home like a garden. The vegetables they eat every meal are all planted by themselves. The older people who are relatively healthy also go to the nearby mountains to cut firewood, and they have already cut more than fifty loads, filling the wood shed to the brim. Cao Lanying does not let everyone do heavy work. When she sees someone carrying a heavy load, she snatches it away and carries it herself, so everyone sometimes secretly does work behind her back. The elderly people said to the director, "We can't just eat and do nothing. Besides, we also want to contribute to the Great Leap Forward!"

    Since the Respect-the-Aged Home was opened more than two months ago, the elderly people who have entered the home have regarded the home as their own and placed their old-age happiness in the Respect-the-Aged Home. Those who initially entered the home with a tentative attitude have also quickly changed their views and are determined to live out their lives in the home. Cao Zhengli talked to me about the situation before and after he and his wife entered the home. He said that after hearing the news that the commune was running a Respect-the-Aged Home, he was worried that life in the home would not be free and that it would be difficult to get along with so many people. One morning, he went to the home alone to find out the details, had breakfast, and left. Five days later, he entered the home one night and stayed there, living comfortably and eating well. The elderly people who had entered the home earlier treated him very warmly. The next morning, as soon as it dawned, he went back to persuade his wife, Cao Xia's wife, to come. Cao Xia's wife stayed for eight days before deciding to settle down in the home with Cao Zhengli, and transported their cooking utensils and furniture such as pots, pans, and bowls by boat. These elderly people often go to the villages where they originally lived to visit acquaintances. They praise the Respect-the-Aged Home to everyone they meet. Some people even hum songs.

    幸福的晚年
    ——访新桥公社第一敬老院
    本报记者  周哲生
    在一个树林密布、溪水环流、环境幽静的山坡上，有两幢高大的房屋，门前挂有一块红匾，匾上写着“过去吃尽人间苦，今天住进幸福堂，有吃有穿生活好，永远不忘共产党。”这是新桥公社第一敬老院。12月上旬的一天，我访问了这个敬老院，看到老人们安闲自在地度着幸福晚年中的一日。
    那天早晨我跨进敬老院的时候，看到院内打扫得干干净净，墙壁粉刷得光亮洁白。休息室张灯结彩、诗画满壁。休息室正中墙壁上有副对联：“过去辛酸眼泪肚里咽，如今敬老院中度晚年”。扩音器正转播戏剧和音乐。敬老院共有十七个无儿无女无依靠的老人。
    敬老院有集体男宿舍、女宿舍和供老年夫妇住宿的房间。我和院长曹兰英同志走进一个房间里，阳光把屋内照得亮堂堂的。双人铺上垫着尺把厚的稻草。床的右首有张桌子，桌上放着煤油灯、洗脸盆和梳妆用具。设备虽然简陋，却也像个家庭。房间的主人夏正礼和曹夏氏手里捧着火钵子在烤火，我问他们怎么进院的、过得好不好？夏正礼说：“我们夫妻两个都是七十岁左右的人，做了大半辈子长工，老来不能劳动，又无儿无女，要在旧社会恐怕早就饿死了。”说到这里，曹夏氏在一旁插嘴：“家里住的破屋，落雨下雪不能登。现在风吹不着雨打不到，床上稻草厚厚的，老头子进院就领到一条棉裤和一双棉鞋，穿得活像棉花人。”对房门是七十多岁刘小根和李少卿两人合住的房间。刘小根说他和李少卿性情相投，无话不谈，要求在一块，曹兰英就把他们两人安排在这间屋子里。李少卿说他们两人床上的新棉被和身上的棉衣都是敬老院发的，原有的破烂不堪的被子和衣服已经送进公社博物馆。曹兰英告诉我，公社买的八条被子和十多套棉衣，都已发给无被缺衣的老人。
    离开宿舍二三十步路是敬老院的食堂。宽敞的餐厅摆着四张八仙桌、十多张太师椅和长凳，收拾得清清爽爽。炊事员徐孝弟说，院里的家具和炊事用具分文未花，都是社员们赠送的。吃中饭了，夏正礼和王玉成两对老夫妇合坐一桌，其余的人分别围坐在三张桌子上。曹兰英和徐孝弟等三人一人搀着一个瞎老人到饭堂，把饭端送到他们手上。同坐一桌的人把菜一筷筷地夹到瞎子碗里，争着代为添饭。这天中午是三菜一汤：煮青菜、烧豆腐、炒咸菜、萝卜汤，雪白的粳米饭又热又香。我在双目失明的老人徐小英身旁坐下，她一面吃一面诉说身世：幼年失去父母给人做童养媳，丈夫和三个儿女先后死去，老来只剩下光身一人，眼睛就是哭瞎的。她说：“过去我巴望自己早死早好。共产党来了，家门口的穷人日子好过了，照顾我的人也多了，政府救济我，农业社五保，但是我总放心不下。同志呀！进敬老院后，住的好，穿的好，吃的好，照顾得好，在这里活一百岁我也不嫌老啦！”七十多岁的姚长保不时掏出县民政部门送的粉红手帕揩去胡须上的汤水，嘴咂咂地说：“汤好鲜啊。”他指着手上端的大碗对我说：“在家饥一顿饱一顿，菜蔬有盐无油。现在一天三顿热饭热菜。”姚长保无儿无女，在地主家当了四十多年雇工，有病还要替老板干活，想到体衰力弱的时候还不是倒在土地庙或是牛车棚送终！老人拈着白胡子和我说：“想想过去的苦日子眼泪流不尽，看看现在生活睡着也要笑醒过来！”
    中饭后，老人们都坐在敬老院门前的广场上晒太阳，有的在闭目养神，有的在谈家常，有的在说笑话。姚三妹等三个老太婆在为老人们赶做棉鞋，曹兰英也在为老人们缝做布袜。有人提议瞎子徐孝兴说古书，徐孝兴讲了“武松打虎”，大家听得很出神。坐在我身旁的姚长保说，徐孝兴刚进院时旧病复发，睡在床上不能起来，饭做好了大家就先给他盛好端到床前，每天有人给他送茶送水、端尿端屎，伺候得很好。徐孝兴对大家在他病中给以关怀和照顾感动得流泪，激动地说：“我这个孤老头子原来单家独户，生了病，睡到半夜想喝口水都没有。现在进院有了照顾，不然的话，这次生病不要想活了！”这些老人早先都受过地主、富农的残酷剥削，弄得身衰体弱，有的还成了残废，在农业社是五保户，虽然吃穿住用等生活费用有了着落，但由于在家无专人照看，生活上还是困难很多，来院时都有一些小病，敬老院请医生帮助治疗。院长和炊事员端茶送水以至喂饭。他们自己相互之间也很关心，现在有病的都已痊愈，人人健康，身心愉快，加之生活有条理，他们之中很多人的脸上，已露出了红色，体重有了增加。“十七（个）老人住山坡，敬老院里副业多，青菜萝卜自己种，割柴养猪草鞋做。”老人们用这几句话形容他们搞副业生产的情景。在热火朝天的大跃进形势影响下，院方虽然没有规定要劳动，老人们还是勤勤恳恳地做一些他们力所能及的工作。姚三妹和钱魏氏每天去割猪草，把院里的两头小猪每头养有七十多斤重了，她们计划在春节宰一头自吃，一头卖给国家，把卖猪的钱用来发展家禽副业。老人们把院里的两亩多菜地种得像个花园，他们每顿吃的菜都是自己亲手栽种的。身体比较健壮的老人还到邻近的山上去割柴，已割了五十多担，柴房里堆得满满的。曹兰英不让大家干重活，看到那个担子挑重了她就夺过去自己挑，所以大家有时背着她去干活。老人们对院长说：“我们不能光吃不做，再说大跃进我们也要出份力哟！”
    敬老院开办两个多月来，入院的老人都以院为家，把老来的幸福寄托在敬老院。当初抱着试试看的态度进院的人，也都很快转变了看法，决心在院里养老送终。曹正礼和我谈起他们夫妇两人进院前后的情景。他说他听到社里办了敬老院的消息后，顾虑到院中生活不自由、人多处不好。有天早上他一个人到院里摸了摸底细，吃了顿早饭就走了。过了五天一个人晚上进院住下，住得舒适，吃得满意，先进院的老人待他很热情，第二天天一亮才回去把老伴曹夏氏动员来了。曹夏氏住了八天以后才决定和曹正礼在院里安家，把自己家里的锅瓢碗盏等炊事用具和家具用船运来。这些老人经常到原来居住的村子去探望熟人，逢人就夸赞敬老院好，有人还哼唱着诗歌。（附图片）
