Xinhua News Agency, 13th. This reporter learned from the Central Meteorological Bureau that the artificial snowfall experiment was successfully conducted in Donggang, Fusong County, Jilin Province, on November 24th. After the experimenters burned chemical agents on the ground, snow fell from the sky, and it snowed for a whole day. The snow only fell within the experimental area; there was no snow in the surrounding areas.

Precipitation (snow in winter, rain in summer) can be induced by burning chemical agents on the ground under appropriate cloud conditions in both mountainous and plain areas. The smoke generated by the burning agents rises into the high altitude, and the fine smoke particles come into contact with the moisture in the clouds, prompting the moisture to freeze on the smoke particles. Surrounding water vapor sublimates (the process by which a gas becomes a solid without liquefying) on these freezing nuclei, forming ice crystals. The ice crystals gradually enlarge, and eventually snow or rain will fall.

This method is simple to operate and can be mastered by ordinary people. Its successful experiment has created conditions for carrying out mass artificial weather control work in the future.

This experiment was completed under the leadership of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the cooperation of the Central Meteorological Bureau, the Jilin Provincial Meteorological Bureau, the Liaoning Provincial Meteorological Bureau, and the People's Liberation Army garrison.

    人工降雪试验成功
    新华社13日讯  记者从中央气象局获悉：人工降雪的试验，11月24日在吉林省抚松县东岗获得成功。试验者在地上燃烧化学药剂后，天空降下了雪来，整整下了一天。这场雪只在试验地区内下，周围地区都没有。
    在地上燃烧化学药剂降水（冬季降雪，夏季降雨），在有适当云层的条件下不论山区、平原都可进行。药剂燃烧所生的烟升入高空，微细的烟粒与云层里的水分接触，促使水分在烟粒上冻结起来。周围水汽凝华（由气体不经液化成为固体叫凝华）在这种冻结核上，就成为冰晶，冰晶逐渐加大，最后就会降下雪或雨来。
    这种方法操作简单，一般人都能掌握。它的试验成功，为今后开展群众性的人工控制天气工作创造了条件。
    这次试验是在中共吉林省委领导下，由中央气象局、吉林省气象局、辽宁省气象局和人民解放军驻军协作完成的。
