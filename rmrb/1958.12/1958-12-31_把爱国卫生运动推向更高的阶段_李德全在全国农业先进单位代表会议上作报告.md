Xinhua News Agency, December 30th. Li Dequan, Deputy Director of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and Minister of Public Health, delivered a report on the basic situation of the 1958 Patriotic Health Campaign and future tasks at the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units in Socialist Construction on the afternoon of December 30th.

Li Dequan said: Eliminating the Four Pests, emphasizing hygiene, and striving to eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people is a political task put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a component of the National Agricultural Development Program, an important measure for developing industry and agriculture, and a great movement to improve the people's health, change customs, transform the country, and invigorate the national spirit. The purpose of this movement is to protect the people's health, improve labor efficiency, promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and better build socialism.

She pointed out that the Patriotic Health Campaign, through the form of mass movement, starting with the elimination of the Four Pests, popularizing hygiene knowledge, breaking superstitions, and striving to eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people and their roots, aims to improve people's health and achieve the goals of invigorating everyone and changing customs. This is an important aspect of our country's great cultural revolution. Eliminating the Four Pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger the people are unprecedented feats. In history, although people have continuously struggled against nature, there has never been a time when they could actively, organizationally, and on a large scale mobilize the masses to launch an attack on pests, harmful birds, and harmful animals that endanger the people, always remaining in a passive defensive position. Only the liberated Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party, dare to place the great combat task of striving to eliminate the Four Pests in the next few years and gradually eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people before themselves, and strive to achieve it.

Li Dequan then described the gradual and in-depth development of the Patriotic Health Campaign in the six years since the launch of the Patriotic Health Campaign centered on opposing the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism in 1952. She said that since the Party Central Committee issued the National Agricultural Development Program, proposing the call to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and strive to eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people, especially since the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in our country, the Patriotic Health Campaign has experienced new development. Under the vigorous promotion of the Party and the government, the Patriotic Health Campaign has seen wave after wave of upsurges throughout the country.

Regarding the 1958 Patriotic Health Campaign, Li Dequan said: The achievements of the movement are mainly reflected in the following: Due to the adoption of measures such as quick battles and quick resolutions, repeated sweeps, treating both the symptoms and the root causes, combining Chinese and Western medicine, and using both indigenous and foreign methods, a large number of Four Pests have been eliminated; at the same time, combined with urban and rural production and municipal construction, a large number of breeding grounds for the Four Pests have been eliminated. Other pests, harmful birds, and harmful animals such as snails, lice, fleas, bedbugs, cockroaches, poisonous snakes, and wolves have also been reduced, and their degree of harm has been significantly reduced. According to incomplete statistics as of early November, the country has eliminated more than 1.88 billion rats and more than 1.96 billion sparrows, and has also eliminated a large number of mosquitoes, flies, maggots, and mosquito larvae.

While eliminating the Four Pests, various localities have generally combined with the characteristics of production to carry out repeated and thorough sweeps, comprehensive cleaning, and tidying up of residences, toilets, and livestock pens, and have cleared a large amount of garbage and sewage. The country has basically achieved the separation of humans and livestock, ensuring that people have toilets, livestock have pens, and poultry have nests. Personal hygiene has also improved significantly, and loving cleanliness and emphasizing hygiene have begun to become a new social trend. The sanitation of minority areas and remote mountainous areas is also changing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics as of early November, the country has cleared 29.5 billion tons of garbage, accumulated 61.1 billion tons of fertilizer, dredged ditches totaling 1.65 million kilometers in length, and built and renovated more than 85.5 million toilets. With the vigorous development of steel production, water conservancy construction, and people's communes, the hygiene management of collective labor places such as construction sites, canteens, and nurseries, as well as welfare undertakings, has been strengthened, protecting the health of women and infants. Many places have improved the living conditions of the working people, presenting a delightful and refreshing view of the living environment.

As a result of eliminating the Four Pests, emphasizing hygiene, and actively preventing and treating diseases, smallpox, plague, and kala-azar have been basically eliminated, and the incidence of several common acute infectious diseases such as typhus, relapsing fever, measles, and pertussis has been greatly reduced. Schistosomiasis has been basically eliminated in 192 counties and cities, accounting for about 60% of the epidemic areas, of which Jiangsu, Fujian, and Shanghai have been basically eliminated throughout the province and city. Malaria has been basically eliminated in many counties and cities. Hookworm disease, filariasis, venereal diseases, Kaschin-Beck disease, and goiter have also been basically eliminated in some areas. Basic control of acute poisoning and heatstroke has been achieved in industry and mining. Effective prevention and treatment measures have also been taken for silicosis and chronic poisoning. The popularization of new midwifery methods has basically eliminated puerperal fever and neonatal tetanus. Active prevention and treatment work has also been carried out for other various diseases, and the morbidity and mortality rates have been greatly reduced.

Li Dequan said: The development of the Patriotic Health Campaign has shown its role in supporting industrial and agricultural production and promoting national construction by increasing fertilizer, reducing grain loss, and improving labor attendance and labor efficiency, thereby increasing production in the fields and prolonging people's lives.

The practice of eliminating the Four Pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger the people can not only change the country's sanitation but also change people's ideology and mental outlook, break the superstition of ghosts and gods, and demonstrate the great power of people conquering nature, thereby making the broad masses more firmly confident in transforming nature and conquering nature.

The movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people has also driven the entire health work. At the same time, the development of other tasks in the health department has further promoted the movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate diseases. Through this movement, hospital work has been greatly improved, the spirit of running hospitals diligently and thriftily has been further implemented, medical and health scientific research work has been more closely integrated with actual needs and has achieved greater development; the strengths of both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have been better utilized, and the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have also been closer. All these achievements have laid the foundation for accelerating the elimination of the Four Pests and eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger the people. When talking about the basic experience of the Patriotic Health Campaign over the past year, Li Dequan pointed out the following four points:

First, conscientiously implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and strengthening the leadership of the Party, giving prominence to politics, is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous development and victory of the movement. The reason why advanced regions and units in health work have been able to achieve outstanding achievements in the Patriotic Health Campaign is first and foremost because these units attached importance to this work from the leadership level, conscientiously studied the Central Committee's past instructions on carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign, and resolutely implemented the spirit of the instructions among cadres and the masses, incorporating the movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people into the entire work plan. The reason why various model figures in health work have been able to make remarkable achievements is first and foremost because they resolutely obeyed the leadership of the Party, resolutely responded to the call of the Party, were not afraid of any difficulties, and always tirelessly completed the tasks put forward by the Party.

Second, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and conducting extensive and in-depth publicity and education, breaking superstitions, and launching large-scale mass movements are the keys to the movement's tremendous achievements. Many regions have generally conducted publicity and education, combined with the rectification movement to carry out large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates, and adopted various methods such as comparing the new and old societies, calculating three accounts (accounts of wasted grain, accounts of infectious diseases affecting health and production, and accounts of accumulating fertilizer in conjunction with eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds), big-character posters, report meetings, oath-taking rallies, radio broadcasts, exhibitions, slogans, cartoons, and singing, so that the publicity work truly reached the level of being known to every household and known to everyone, overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas, and strengthening the confidence in eliminating pests and diseases. After the masses liberated their minds, they immediately took action, resulting in an upsurge in the movement. In the movement, many advanced regions, advanced units, and thousands of model figures and Four Pest elimination experts emerged. The broad masses exerted infinite power and wisdom, invented and created many effective methods, manufactured many indigenous tools, and utilized many wild plants. These indigenous methods, indigenous tools, and wild plants cost little, were effective, and could be manufactured by the masses themselves, and materials could be found everywhere, solving the difficulties of insufficient medicines and equipment for eliminating the Four Pests. Some places have also promoted and applied them to the control of agricultural and forestry pests.

Third, taking production as the key link, making overall arrangements, and combining multiple aspects are the best ways to promote production and drive the movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people. The movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people must proceed from production, be closely integrated with production, and serve production. Production drives health work, and health work promotes production. The practice in many places is that in terms of leadership methods, unified leadership, organization, planning, arrangements, actions, inspections, evaluations, reports, summaries... were adopted, and Party and government at all levels divided and contracted out areas (county committees contracted out townships, township committees contracted out cooperatives, cooperative branches contracted out teams, Party and League members contracted out households). In terms of action, multi-faceted combinations were implemented (environmental sanitation combined with fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction combined with mosquito elimination, autumn harvest and grain protection and deep plowing combined with rat and sparrow elimination, street repairs combined with greening, household hygiene combined with thrift and housekeeping, collective welfare combined with labor protection...). In terms of time arrangement, many regions adopted the approach of "doing a lot during slack periods, doing a little during busy periods, and launching surprise attacks when necessary" based on the production season. In terms of power arrangement, the principle of mobilizing men, women, old and young was implemented, and a dedicated team was organized to contract and be responsible, and the division of labor in health work was implemented according to the division of labor in production. These practices have been very successful.

Fourth, combining surprise attacks with regular work, combining technical guidance with mass movements, combining Chinese and Western medicine, and using both indigenous and foreign methods are the basic methods for carrying out the movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people. Practice over the past year has proven that in the movement, where the laws and characteristics of the breeding of the Four Pests and the prevalence of diseases are grasped, repeated sweeps are carried out persistently, and a permanent place is maintained on the basis of the attacks, the results can be obtained quickly and the results can be consolidated. During the movement, it is necessary to make a big fuss about technical revolution and combine technical forces with the power of the masses. It is necessary to pay attention to giving play to the advisory role of Chinese and Western medical personnel, organize them to go deep into the movement, collect, sort out, and study the inventions and creations of the masses, and promote them in a timely manner. In places where the technical forces and the masses are well combined, and where Chinese, Western, indigenous, and foreign methods are well combined, the methods for eliminating the Four Pests are becoming increasingly abundant. In addition, combining symptomatic treatment with addressing the root causes is also one of the effective methods summarized in the movement.

Li Dequan then put forward the future tasks of the Patriotic Health Campaign. She said: 1959 is the second year of our people's three years of hard work, and it is also the tenth year of the founding of our great People's Republic of China. We must conscientiously implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and advance health work towards new goals. Our battle slogan is: Mobilize the whole party, mobilize the whole people, and strive to basically achieve "four withouts" (no rats, no sparrows, no flies, no mosquitoes) in all possible places across the country, basically eliminate four parasitic diseases (schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, hookworm disease), and welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Li Dequan said that people's communes have now been generally established in rural areas throughout the country. Our health work must adapt to this new situation. At the same time, the establishment of people's communes has also put forward new tasks for health work. We must earnestly strengthen the sanitation work of nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and canteens through mass health campaigns. Due to the implementation of collective living, the prevention of infectious diseases is even more important. Eating well, sleeping well, taking good care of children, cleaning inside and out, preventing diseases well, and providing good care when sick are all important contents of our rural health propaganda work. In the early stage of 1959, in conjunction with the work of rectifying the communes, we should conduct an in-depth investigation and study of the health work of the people's communes, carry out rectification, and propose specific steps and measures for carrying out health campaigns and carrying out health work in the communes. In the situation of the entire people running industry in a big way, occupational health is even more important. Carrying out health campaigns in factories, mines, construction sites, and various mass industrial production must be combined with industrial production and with safety work.

She further pointed out that the movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate diseases must be well arranged according to seasonal characteristics. In the winter and spring of 1959, we must generally carry out surprise attacks to lay the foundation for the whole year. After the surprise attacks, all localities and units can formulate plans for regular surprise attacks and regular sanitation systems based on their specific circumstances. In addition to basically eliminating four parasitic diseases in all possible places, the incidence of some common infectious diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and pertussis is also required to be greatly reduced compared to 1958.

Li Dequan said that we are fully confident that we will achieve these requirements in 1959. As long as we resolutely obey the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the Party's policies, and give prominence to politics, we will move from existing victories to greater victories. Health administrative departments at all levels and every health worker should further implement the Party's mass line in our work, do a good job in publicizing to the masses, and learn from the masses with an open mind.

Li Dequan called on all staff members on the medical and health front to unite more closely under the leadership of the Party and resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's guiding principle of close integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and close integration of specialized talents and the broad masses. All good methods of preventing and treating diseases in traditional Chinese and Western medicine should be adopted, and special attention should be paid to giving play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine in eliminating diseases. Various creations, inventions, and effective experiences that have emerged in the movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people, especially the experience of solving problems on the spot, should be widely collected, sorted out, studied, and promoted. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the production and supply of medicinal materials and the scientific research work of eliminating the Four Pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger the people, and actively organize medical and health personnel to go to the countryside and factories, and go deep into the fields and construction sites. On the basis of establishing and improving basic-level health organizations, a prevention and control technical guidance network with segmented responsibilities should be established to ensure the smooth completion of the task of eliminating the Four Pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating the diseases that most seriously endanger the people, and to better support national construction.

Li Dequan requested all localities to continue to pay attention to organizing inspections, competitions, and evaluations, and adopt the method of holding on-site meetings to visit each other and continuously advance the movement. Provinces, districts, cities, and counties should organize inspections several times a year, and townships and basic-level units should conduct inspections once a week. Areas and units that are linked and agreed upon should maintain regular contact, learn from each other, and supervise each other.

Li Dequan finally said that the victorious development of the movement to eliminate the Four Pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate the diseases that most seriously endanger the people not only changes the sanitary conditions of our country but also demonstrates the great revolutionary spirit of our people, indicating that we have the full power to conquer nature under the leadership of the Party. We must always maintain a high fighting spirit and soaring enthusiasm, combine revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit, and in order to better serve the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country and to further improve the health level of the people, we must push the Patriotic Health Campaign to a higher stage.

    把爱国卫生运动推向更高的阶段
    李德全在全国农业先进单位代表会议上作报告
    新华社30日讯  中央爱国卫生运动委员会副主任、卫生部部长李德全30日下午在全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议上，作了关于1958年爱国卫生运动的基本情况和今后的任务的报告。
    李德全说：除四害、讲卫生、努力消灭危害人民最严重的疾病是党中央和毛主席提出来的一项政治任务，是全国农业发展纲要中的一个组成部分，是发展工农业的一项重要措施，是增进人民体质、移风易俗、改造国家、振奋民族精神的伟大运动。这个运动的目的是为了保护人民身体健康，提高劳动效率，促进工农业生产大跃进，更好地建设社会主义。
    她指出，爱国卫生运动就是通过群众运动的形式，从除四害做起，普及卫生知识，破除迷信，努力消灭危害人民最严重的疾病和它们的根源，增进人民的健康，以达到人人振奋、移风易俗的目的，这是我国伟大文化革命的一个重要方面。除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病是史无前例的壮举，在历史上，人们虽然不断地向自然界进行斗争，却从来没有一次能够主动地有组织地大规模地发动广大群众，向危害人民的害虫、害鸟、害兽发动进攻，总是处于被动的防御地位。只有解放了的中国人民，在党的领导下，才敢把争取在最近几年内，除尽四害，逐步消灭危害人民最严重的疾病这一伟大的战斗任务放在自己的面前，并努力促其实现。
    李德全接着叙述了从1952年开展了以反对美帝国主义细菌战为中心的爱国卫生运动以后，六年来爱国卫生运动逐步深入开展的情况。她说，自从党中央发布了农业发展纲要，提出除四害、讲卫生、努力消灭危害人民最严重的疾病的号召以来，特别是自从我国工农业大跃进以来，爱国卫生运动有了新的发展。在党和政府的大力推动之下，爱国卫生运动在全国范围内，就一浪接一浪地出现了高潮。
    关于1958年的爱国卫生运动，李德全说：运动的成就主要表现在：由于采取了速战速决、反复扫荡、标本兼治、中西结合、土洋并举的措施，大量消灭了四害；同时结合城乡生产和市政建设，消灭了大量的四害孳生地。其他害虫、害鸟、害兽如钉螺、虱子、跳蚤、臭虫、蟑螂、毒蛇、狼等也有所减少，其危害程度已显著减轻。据11月上旬为止的不完全统计，全国已消灭老鼠十八亿八千余万只，消灭麻雀十九亿六千余万只，并消灭了大量的蚊蝇、蛆蛹和孑孓。
    在除四害的同时，各地普遍结合生产的特点，进行了反复多次的彻底扫除，全面清洁，整理了住室、厕所、畜圈，清除了大量垃圾污物。全国已基本实现了人畜分居，做到了人有厕所，牲畜有圈，家禽有窝。个人卫生也有了显著提高，爱清洁、讲卫生，开始成为社会的新风尚。少数民族地区和偏僻山区的卫生面貌也在日新月异。据11月上旬为止的不完全统计，全国清除垃圾二百九十五亿吨，积肥六百一十一亿吨，疏通沟渠长达一百六十五万公里，新建和改建厕所八千五百余万个。随着大搞钢铁生产、水利建设和人民公社的迅速发展，加强了工地、食堂、托儿所等集体劳动场所和福利事业的卫生管理工作，保护了妇女婴儿的健康。许多地方改善了劳动人民的居住条件，使生活环境呈现出一幅令人心旷神怡的美景。
    由于除四害、讲卫生和积极防治疾病的结果，天花、鼠疫和黑热病已基本消灭，常见的几种急性传染病如斑疹伤寒、回归热、麻疹、百日咳等的发病率大为降低，血吸虫病已在一百九十二个县市基本消灭，约占流行区的60％，其中江苏、福建、上海已在全省、市范围内基本消灭，虐疾在不少的县市基本消灭。钩虫病、丝虫病、性病、大骨节病、甲状腺肿等疾病在一些地区也已基本消灭。工矿中基本控制了急性中毒、中暑现象。矽肺及慢性中毒，也有了有效的防治措施。普及了新法接生，产妇产褥热及婴儿破伤风已经基本消灭。其他各种疾病也积极开展了防治工作，发病率和死亡率大为降低。
    李德全说：爱国卫生运动的开展，已从增加肥料，减少粮食损耗，提高劳动出勤率和劳动效率，从田增产、人增寿上，显示支援工农业生产和促进国家建设的作用。
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病运动的实践不仅能改变国家的卫生面貌，而且也能改变人们的思想意识和精神面貌，使人们打破了迷信鬼神的思想，显示出人定胜天的伟大力量，从而使广大群众更加坚定了改造自然，征服自然的信心。
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病的运动也带动了整个卫生工作。同时，卫生部门其他各项工作的发展，又进一步推动了除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动。通过这个运动，医院工作有了很大的改进，勤俭办院的精神得到了进一步的贯彻，医药卫生科学研究工作得以更密切地结合实际的需要，有了更大的发展；中医西医的力量都能得到更好地发挥，中医西医的团结合作也更加密切了。所有这些成绩，都为加速除尽四害、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病奠定了基础。李德全在谈到一年来爱国卫生运动的基本经验时，指出了以下的四点：
    第一、认真贯彻党中央的指示加强党的领导，政治挂帅，是运动不断发展取得胜利的根本保证。卫生工作先进地区和单位所以能够在爱国卫生运动中取得卓越的成就，首先是因为这些单位从领导上重视了这一工作，认真研究了中央关于开展爱国卫生运动的历次指示，并且把指示的精神在干部和群众中进行了坚决的贯彻，把除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病运动列入整个的工作计划之内。各个卫生工作模范人物所以能够做出显著成绩，首先也是因为他们坚决服从党的领导，坚决响应党的号召，不怕任何困难，始终不懈地去完成党所提出的任务。
    第二、依靠群众，发动群众，广泛深入地进行宣传教育，破除迷信，大搞群众运动，是运动取得巨大成就的关键。很多地区普遍进行了宣传教育，结合整风运动开展了大鸣大放、大争大辩，采取了新旧社会对比、算三笔账（浪费粮食账、传染疾病影响健康和生产账、结合消灭蚊蝇孳生地进行积肥的账）、大字报、报告会、誓师大会、广播会、展览会、标语、漫画、演唱等各种方式，使宣传工作真正达到了家喻户晓、人人皆知的程度，克服了右倾保守思想，坚定了除害灭病的信心。群众解放了思想之后，就立即行动起来，从而出现了运动的高潮。在运动中涌现出了不少先进地区、先进单位和千千万万的模范人物、除四害能手。广大群众发挥了无穷的力量和智慧，发明创造了许多行之有效的好方法，制造了许多土工具，利用了不少野生植物。这些土方法、土工具、野生植物，花钱少、效果好，群众自己可以制造，材料随处都可以找到，解决了除四害药械不足的困难。有的地方还推广应用到杀灭农林业害虫方面。
  第三、以生产为纲，统筹安排，多边结合，是促进生产，带动除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病运动的最好办法。除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病运动，必须从生产出发，紧密结合生产，为生产服务。生产带动了卫生工作，卫生工作又促进了生产。很多地方的做法是：在领导方法上采取了多方面统一（统一领导、组织、计划、安排、行动、检查、评比、汇报、总结……），各级党政分片包干（县委包乡、乡委包社、社支部包队、党团员包户）的办法。在行动方面实行了多边结合（环境卫生结合积肥、兴修水利结合灭蚊、秋收保粮和深耕土地结合灭鼠、灭雀、整修街道结合绿化、家庭卫生结合勤俭持家、集体福利结合劳动保护……）。在时间安排方面，许多地区根据生产季节，采取“小忙大干、大忙小干、必要时突击干”的作法。在力量安排方面贯彻了男女老少齐动员的原则，并组织专职队伍包干负责，按照生产上的分工实行了卫生工作的分工。这些做法，都很成功。
    第四、突击工作与经常工作相结合、技术指导与群众运动相结合、中西结合、土洋并举，是开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病运动的基本方法。一年来的实践证明，凡是在运动中掌握了四害孳生和疾病流行的规律和特点，坚持不懈地进行反复扫荡，并在突击运动的基础上保持经常性的地方，就能迅速取得成效，并能巩固成绩。在开展运动期间，必须大闹技术革命，使技术力量与群众力量结合起来。必须注意发挥中西医药人员的参谋作用，组织他们深入运动，收集、整理、研究群众的发明创造，及时加以推广。在技术力量和群众力量结合得好、中西土洋结合得好的地方，除四害的办法就日益丰富。此外，治标治本相结合也是运动中总结出来的有效方法之一。
    李德全接着提出爱国卫生运动今后的任务。她说：1959年是我国人民苦战三年的第二年，又是我们伟大的中华人民共和国建国的第十年。我们要认真贯彻党中央的指示，使卫生工作朝着新的目标前进。我们的战斗口号是：全党动员，全民动手，争取在全国一切可能的地方基本实现“四无”，基本消灭四种寄生虫病（血吸虫病、虐疾、丝虫病、钩虫病），迎接建国十周年。
    李德全说，现在，全国农村已经普遍成立了人民公社。我们的卫生工作必须适应这一新的形势。同时，人民公社的成立，也向卫生工作提出了新的任务。我们要通过群众性的卫生运动把托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、食堂的卫生工作认真加强起来。由于实行了生活集体化，传染病的预防工作更加重要了。吃好、睡好，把孩子带好，把里里外外打扫好，防病防得好，有病护理好，这些都是我们农村卫生宣传工作的重要内容。1959年初，要结合整社的工作，把人民公社的卫生工作做一次深入的调查研究，进行整顿，提出在公社中开展卫生运动、进行卫生工作的具体步骤和措施。在全民大办工业的情况下，劳动卫生也更加重要了。在工厂、矿山、工地以及各种群众性工业生产中间开展卫生运动，必须与工业生产相结合，与安全工作相结合。
    她又指出：除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动要很好地根据季节特点加以安排。1959年冬春季，要普遍进行突击运动，给全年打下基础。在突击运动之后，各地和各个单位可以根据具体情况，制订出定期突击工作的计划和经常性的卫生制度。除去在一切可能的地方基本消灭四种寄生虫病外，对于一些常见的传染病如痢疾、伤寒、百日咳等疾病的发病率，也要求比1958年大大降低。
    李德全说，我们完全有信心，在1959年内达到这些要求。只要我们坚决服从党的领导，认真贯彻党的方针，实行政治挂帅，我们就会从已有的胜利走向更大的胜利。各级卫生行政部门和每个卫生工作者都应该更进一步在我们的工作中贯彻党的群众路线，做好向群众宣传工作，并且虚心向群众学习。
    李德全号召医药卫生战线上的全体工作人员在党的领导下，更紧密地团结起来，坚决贯彻党中央所指出的中西医密切结合、专门人才和广大群众密切结合的方针。中西医一切好的防病治病方法都要采用，特别要注意发挥中医中药在消灭疾病工作上的作用。在除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病运动中出现的各种创造发明、有效经验，特别是就地取材解决问题的经验，都要广泛搜集，整理研究，加以推广。同时要加强药材生产供应和除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病的科学研究工作，并积极组织医药卫生人员下乡、下厂，深入田间、工地，在基层卫生组织建立和健全的基础上，建立分段负责的防治技术指导网，以保证除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病任务的顺利完成，更好地支援国家建设。
    李德全要求各地继续注意组织检查、竞赛、评比工作，采取召开现场会议的办法，互相参观，把运动不断向前推进。各省、区、市、县应组织一年几次的检查，各乡社和基层单位要做到每周检查一次。互相挂钩、协议的地区和单位要保持经常联系，互相学习，互相督促。
    李德全最后说，除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病运动的胜利开展，不仅改变着我国的卫生面貌，而且显示了我国人民伟大的革命志气，说明了我们在党的领导之下，完全有力量征服自然。我们要永远保持昂扬的斗志和冲天的干劲，把革命热情和科学精神结合起来，为了更好地为我国工农业生产大跃进服务，为了更进一步提高人民的健康水平，把爱国卫生运动推向更高的阶段。
