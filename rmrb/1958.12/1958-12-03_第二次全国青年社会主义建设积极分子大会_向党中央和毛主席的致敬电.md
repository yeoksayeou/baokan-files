To the respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

We, the five thousand young people attending the Second National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism, representing the hearts of the nation's youth, extend our highest and most sincere respect to our most beloved Party Central Committee and great teacher Chairman Mao!

Three years ago, at the First National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism, we made a solemn guarantee to the Party: the nation's youth would certainly follow the direction indicated by the Party and advance bravely and unswervingly along the road of socialism. Now, with excitement, we report to the Party: the youth of all nationalities across the country have not disappointed the Party's teachings and expectations, and have played a heroic vanguard role on all fronts of the socialist revolution and construction of the motherland.

The Party is the source of all our strength and wisdom. It is the Party that has pointed out a clear political direction for us, formulated the general line of socialist construction, and illuminated the road forward for all our work; it is the Party that has taught us to resolutely struggle against all kinds of decadent bourgeois ideas, enhanced our communist consciousness, guided us to break superstitions, liberated us from the shackles of various conservative ideas, and established the idea of continuous revolution; it is the Party that always cares about our healthy growth, encouraging us to be good in health, good in learning, and good in work. Every small step of progress and achievement we make is valued and supported by the Party. We deeply realize that without the leadership of the Party, there would be nothing for the youth.

Now, the people of the whole country are continuing to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and are striving to prepare conditions for the future transition from socialism to communism. This is a great and glorious historical task, and also an arduous and complex struggle. We, the delegates attending the conference, resolutely guarantee to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: the nation's youth will certainly follow the Party's teachings, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and building the country with diligence and thrift, work heroically, work diligently, and serve as a shock force in socialist construction.

We will certainly follow the Party's teachings, more consciously carry out ideological transformation, constantly improve our communist consciousness, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, and strive to learn cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge, so as to become socialist laborers who are both red and expert, deeply red and deeply expert.

We will certainly follow the Party's teachings, always maintain revolutionary vigilance, actively participate in military training, and be ready at any time to contribute all our strength to the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and to the defense of the motherland and world peace.

Respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our hearts are forever with you. Our young generation will always be closely united around the Party; wherever the Party points, we will rush there. We will always maintain vigor and vitality, be humble and cautious, and never disappoint the Party's ardent expectations of us. We must strive to accelerate the construction of socialism and to realize the most sublime ideal of mankind—communism—in our generation.

Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live our most respected leader and teacher Chairman Mao!

    第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会
    向党中央和毛主席的致敬电敬爱的党中央和毛主席：
    我们出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的五千名青年，代表着全国青年的心意，向我们最敬爱的党中央和伟大的导师毛主席致最崇高、最诚挚的敬礼！
    三年前，在第一次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上，我们曾经向党提出过庄严的保证：全国青年一定遵循着党所指示的方向，坚定不移地沿着社会主义的道路英勇前进。现在，我们怀着兴奋的心情向党汇报：全国各族青年没有辜负党的教导和期望，在祖国社会主义革命和建设的各个战线上，都发挥了英勇的突击作用。
    党是我们一切力量和智慧的源泉。是党，给我们指出了明确的政治方向，制定了社会主义建设总路线，照亮了我们一切工作前进的道路；是党，教导我们同资产阶级各种腐朽思想坚决斗争，提高了共产主义觉悟，引导我们破除迷信，从各种保守思想的束缚中解放出来，树立起不断革命的思想；是党，时刻关怀着我们健康的成长，鼓舞着我们要做到身体好、学习好和工作好。我们每一点微小的进步和成绩，都受到党的重视和支持。我们深深地体会到：没有党的领导，就没有青年的一切。
    现在，全国人民正在继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，并且为将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义准备条件而奋斗。这是一个伟大的光荣的历史任务，也是一个艰巨而复杂的斗争。我们出席大会的全体代表坚决向党中央和毛主席保证：全国青年一定遵循党的教导，继续发扬艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的精神，英勇劳动，勤奋工作，当好社会主义建设的突击队。
    我们一定遵循党的教导，更加自觉地进行思想改造，不断提高共产主义觉悟，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，努力学习文化科学技术知识，使自己成为又红又专，红透专深的社会主义的劳动者。
    我们一定遵循党的教导，永远保持革命警惕，积极参加军事训练，随时准备为解放台、澎、金、马，为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平，贡献自己的一切力量。
    敬爱的党中央和毛主席，我们的心永远向着您。我们年轻一代永远紧紧地团结在党的周围，党指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里。我们永远保持朝气蓬勃，谦虚谨慎，绝不辜负党对我们的殷切期望，一定要为加速建设社会主义、为在我们这一代手里实现人类最崇高的理想——共产主义而奋斗。
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
    1958年12月2日
