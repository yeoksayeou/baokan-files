Xinhua News Agency, 30th. In their speeches at today's National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, young activists enthusiastically praised the glorious victory of the Party's education and literary policies, stating that serving proletarian politics, combining with productive labor, and maintaining close ties with the working people, were the Party's instructions that enabled them to achieve a great harvest of "Redness" and "Expertise" in their diligent labor.

The Optical Calculation Instrument Factory of the Mathematics and Astronomy Department of Nanjing University, established under the slogan of "Work-Study Program," has produced twelve types of advanced astronomical instruments and other cutting-edge technology products in just over half a year. From the factory director and engineers to the workers, from the entire technical design to the entire manufacturing process, all are undertaken by young students in their twenties. Zhu Yaoxin, the representative of this factory, spoke today about their story of starting from scratch.

For a long time, bourgeois educational thought bound the students of the Mathematics and Astronomy Department like a rope. The department built an observatory, but some professors described the astronomical instruments as almost mystical, afraid that the students would "break" them. They used a large lock to lock the room where the astronomical telescope was kept, forbidding students to touch it. A high-level precision instrument was only open to students once a year.

The Party's policy of combining education with productive labor liberated the students from the shackles of bourgeois educational thought. They boldly proposed to build a factory to manufacture domestically needed astronomical instruments with their own labor, no longer relying on foreign countries. This initiative was supported by the Party organization, but some conservatives ridiculed them with sarcastic words. In order to prove the correctness of the Party's education policy with the first product they produced, the students raised a small amount of capital themselves and set up a factory in a small room of only five square meters under a staircase. In just over half a month, they produced an eight-and-a-half-inch reflecting telescope. Subsequently, they produced a new type of advanced telescope that was not available in China - the Maksutov telescope. This telescope was used to successfully photograph the Andromeda Galaxy, a large nebula 1.5 million light-years away from Earth. The inventor of the telescope, Soviet comrade Maksutov, specially congratulated them. These two successful trials further encouraged the students' determination to conquer the stronghold of cutting-edge science. On November 7th this year, they used a radio telescope they made themselves to receive signals from the sun.

The successful trial production of the "Beijing No. 1" light passenger aircraft by more than 1,400 staff members and workers of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, with the support of other relevant units, was introduced in detail at the conference today by Wang Guang, the representative of all the young people who participated in the trial production of this aircraft. Wang Guang said: The successful trial production of this aircraft is a victory for resolutely implementing the Party's education policy.

Wang Guang said: In the process of trial production of this aircraft, the teachers and students of the college once doubted whether this would reduce the quality of teaching. However, the entire trial production process proved that in the past, many teachers lacked comprehensive knowledge, only focused on theory, and did not pay attention to practice. Now, through production practice, their knowledge has been tested and enriched, and their ideological and professional levels have been greatly improved. In the past, when students did graduation designs, they only talked about comprehensiveness and advancement in theory, often building cars behind closed doors based on hypothetical conditions. Now, they have specifically mastered the common sense and experience of manufacturing aircraft. After participating in actual production labor, students have gone from unfamiliar to familiar with physical labor, and from familiar to loving it. Collectivism and the communist style of daring to think and daring to act have also been greatly promoted in production practice. All of these are powerful rebuttals to the erroneous argument that the quality of teaching would be reduced.

Yao Renyuan, a young student from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, explained in a vivid speech today how the Party's education and literary policies have brought them new artistic life. He said that in the great rectification movement, the Party led them to launch a resolute struggle against bourgeois education policies and artistic ideas. They went to factories and rural areas to do labor training and perform for the working masses. As a result, the spiritual outlook of the youth in the whole college has undergone profound changes. In terms of creation, since they got rid of the past tendency of simply pursuing skills and ignoring content issues, from February to August this year, teachers and students of the whole college created more than 2,000 musical works. In the teaching reform movement, teachers and students criticized bourgeois academic ideas and formulated and compiled 61 teaching outlines, 12 teaching plans, and more than 50 textbooks for various courses. Now Chinese textbooks account for more than 80%.

Yao Renyuan said at the meeting: The practice of struggle has educated us and made us understand that the source of art comes from the fiery struggle and from the working people. People who do not love labor and the working people are not qualified to study music. Singing for the working people and singing to promote socialist construction is our greatest happiness. In his speech, Yao Renyuan also humorously sang two songs, contrasting the kind of foreign accent they used to be good at with the Shanghai opera "Purple Bamboo Tune" learned from the masses, to illustrate the difference between the feelings of bourgeois intellectuals and the feelings of the working people. After his speech, he accepted everyone's warm request and sang two folk songs he learned during the conference, using the tunes of the Anhui "Door Song" and the Northern Jiangsu "Playing Life Field."

Chen Dingguo, the leader of the Youth Amateur Literary Creation Group of Baishazhou Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, explained the amazing artistic creative genius of the working people. Their creation group has a total of 142 members, and in the past year, they have created 34 scripts, 41 small operas, more than 86,000 mountain songs, more than 36,000 quick clappers, and more than 140,000 works of various forms such as doggerel, ballad singing, and crosstalk. When the People's Commune was established in September, they created more than 330 propaganda murals, making Baishazhou colorful and dazzling. Chen Dingguo said: "We must not only build socialism, but also sing about socialism." Next year, they will launch a "reading and poetry writing" movement to organize all the young people in the cooperative into the creative team.

"Taking modern drama as the key, always adhere to the policy of literature and art serving politics, serving production, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers." Xing Sufang, the representative of the Youth Performance Team of the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe, expressed the determination of all the young actors in their team in her speech. Going to construction sites, going to the fields, going to the streets, for several years, they have maintained the glorious tradition of folk troupes maintaining contact with the masses, and have initially achieved a double harvest in politics and art.

There were a total of eleven speakers at the conference today. Among them were Wang Zongyuan, the youth representative of the Alpine Glacier Utilization Research Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shi Banghan, the representative of the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League of Hubei Province, Qi Shien, the representative of the Shouzhang County Committee of the Communist Youth League of Shandong Province, Ma Xiaocui, the second director of the Dongfeng Youth Steel Plant in Lushan County, Henan Province, Liu Dachun, a gunner of the howitzer regiment of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Wang Yinting, a student of the Department of Physics of Tianjin University. The conference will continue tomorrow.

    在劳动中锻炼得又红又专
    青年积极分子歌颂党的教育方针和文艺方针
    新华社30日讯  在今天的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的发言中，青年积极分子们热情地歌颂了党的教育方针和文艺方针的辉煌的胜利，为无产阶级政治服务，与生产劳动结合，密切联系劳动人民，正是党的这些指示，使他们在辛勤的劳动里取得了“红”“专”大丰收。
    在“勤工俭学”口号下办起来的南京大学数学天文系光学计算仪器厂，半年多来已经制出了十二种高级天文仪器和其他尖端技术产品，这个工厂从厂长、工程师到工人，从全部技术设计到全部制造过程，都是由二十来岁的年轻学生担任的。这个工厂的代表朱耀鑫今天在会上讲了他们白手起家办工厂的故事。
    长久以来，资产阶级教育思想像一根绳索样地捆住了数学天文系的学生们。系里建立了一座天文台，但是一些教授却把那些天文仪器说得神乎其神，生怕学生们“弄坏”仪器，他们用一把大锁锁住放天文望远镜的房间，不许学生们动一下。有一种高级的精密仪器，每年只对学生们开放一次。
    党提出的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，把学生们从资产阶级教育思想的束缚下解放出来。他们大胆提出要办个工厂。用自己的劳动来制造国内需要的天文仪器，不再依靠外国。这个倡议得到党组织的支持，但是一些保守派却用尖酸刻薄的话来嘲笑他们。为了要用自己生产的第一个产品来证明党的教育方针的正确，学生们自己凑集了很少的资金，在一座楼梯下面只有五平方米的小屋里办起了工厂，用半个多月的时间制出了一架八吋半的返光望远镜。接着，他们又制成了一种国内没有的最新式的高级望远镜——马克苏托夫望远镜。这架望远镜曾被用来成功地拍摄了距离地球一百五十万光年的仙女星座大星云的照片，望远镜的发明人——苏联的马克苏托夫同志曾特地向他们祝贺。这两次试制的成功更鼓舞了学生们攻克尖端科学堡垒的决心。就在今年11月7日，他们又用自己制成的无线电望远镜收到了来自太阳的讯号。
    北京航空学院一千四百多员工在其他有关单位支援下试制“北京一号”轻型旅客机成功的事，今天由参加试制这架飞机的全体青年的代表王光在大会上作了详细的介绍。王光说：这架飞机的试制成功是坚决贯彻党的教育方针的胜利。
    王光说：学院的师生们在试制这架飞机的过程中，曾经有人怀疑这会不会降低教学质量。但是全部试制的过程证明，过去，许多教师缺乏全面的知识，只钻理论，不重视实践，现在通过生产实践，他们的知识得到了考验和充实，思想水平和业务水平大大提高。学生们过去作毕业设计，只是在理论上空谈全面和先进，常常是根据假设的条件，闭门造车，现在则具体掌握了制造飞机的常识和经验。参加了实际的生产劳动以后，学生们对体力劳动由生疏变成熟悉，由熟悉转向热爱，集体主义思想和敢想敢干的共产主义风格在生产实践中也大大发扬起来。所有这些，都是对于怀疑会降低教学质量的错误论点的有力驳斥。
    上海音乐学院的青年学生姚仁远今天在他的一篇生动的发言里，说明了党的教育方针和文艺方针给他们带来了新的艺术生命。他说，在伟大的整风运动中，党领导他们向资产阶级的教育方针和艺术思想展开了坚决的斗争。下厂下乡劳动锻炼，到劳动群众中去演出。因此全院青年的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。在创作上由于摆脱了以往单纯追求技巧和忽视内容问题的倾向，今年2月到8月，全院师生共创作了音乐作品两千多首。在教学改革运动中，师生们批判了资产阶级学术思想，制订和编写了各种课程的六十一种教学大纲、十二种教学计划和五十多本教材，现在中国教材已占80％以上。
    姚仁远在会上说：斗争的实践教育了我们，使我们懂得了：艺术的源泉来自火热的斗争，来自劳动人民。不热爱劳动和劳动人民的人就没有资格学音乐。为劳动人民歌唱，为促进社会主义建设歌唱，就是我们最大的幸福。姚仁远在发言中，还很有风趣地用过去他们擅长的那种洋腔洋调和向群众学来的沪剧“紫竹调”，对比地唱了两首歌，来说明资产阶级知识分子的感情和劳动人民的感情的区别。他发言以后，又接受大家的热烈的要求，用安徽的“门歌”和苏北的“打寿场”的调子，演唱了他在大会期间学会的两首民歌。
    湖南省沅江县白沙州农业社青年业余文艺创作组组长陈定国的发言，说明了劳动人民的惊人的艺术创作天才。他们的创作组共有一百四十二个组员，一年来共创作了剧本三十四个，小演唱四十一个，山歌八万六千多首，快板三万六千多篇，还有顺口溜、弹词、相声等各种形式的作品十四万多件。在9月份建立人民公社时，他们又创作了宣传壁画三百三十多幅，把白沙州打扮得五彩缤纷，光辉夺目。陈定国说：“我们不仅要建设社会主义，而且要歌唱社会主义。”明年，他们将要开展一个读书和写诗”的运动，把全社青年都组织到创作队伍中来。
    “以现代剧为纲，永远坚持文艺为政治服务，为生产服务，为工农兵服务的方针。”杭州越剧团青年演出队的代表邢素芳在发言中表达了她们全队青年演员的决心。下工地，下田头，上街头，几年来，她们一直保持了民间剧团和群众联系的光荣传统，初步取得了政治上和艺术上的双丰收。
    今天在大会上发言的共十一人。他们之中还有中国科学院高山冰雪利用研究队青年代表王宗元，共青团湖北省孝感地委代表史邦翰，共青团山东省寿张县委代表祁世恩，河南省鲁山县东风青年钢铁厂第二厂长马小翠，中国人民解放军某部榴炮团炮手刘大春，天津大学物理系学生王荫庭。大会明天将继续举行。
