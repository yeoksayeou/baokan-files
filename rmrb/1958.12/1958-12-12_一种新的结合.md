A new combination of professional writers and amateur authors under the leadership of the Party Committee is a collective creation method that has emerged on the basis of the in-depth development of mass cultural activities. It is also an important method of implementing the mass line in literary and artistic creation. Although this method of creation is not the only one, its advantage lies first and foremost in its ability to combine professional writers with workers, peasants, and soldiers in a more profound way, and to closely link literary and artistic creation with the current reality, thereby enabling literary and artistic creation to be more, faster, better, and more economical.

It is particularly worth mentioning that through this collective creation, the leading role of the Party Committee in literary and artistic creation can be brought into play, and both professional writers and amateur workers and peasants can be rapidly improved. This is a step further than the collective creation that only took place within the scope of professional writers in the past. In collective creation, professional writers further deepened their understanding of life, became familiar with the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and worker-peasant-soldier authors also began to write higher-quality literary works with the help of professional authors. Although this change has only just begun, it will have a profound significance for the establishment and prosperity of a new socialist national culture. This is a creative method that deserves to be promoted.

    一种新的结合
    党委领导下专业作家同业余作者相结合，这是在群众文化活动深入开展的基础上出现的一种集体创作方式，也是在文艺创作中贯彻群众路线的一种重要方法。这种创作方式虽然不是唯一的，但是它的好处首先在于能把专业作家同工农兵劳动人民在更深刻的程度上结合起来，并使文艺创作同当前的现实生活紧密联系，从而使文艺创作也能够多快好省。
    特别值得提出的是，通过这种集体创作，可以发挥党委对文艺创作的领导作用，并使专业作家、工农业余作者双方都得到迅速的提高。这就比过去只在专业作家范围内的集体创作更进了一步。在集体创作中，专业作家们进一步深入了生活，熟悉了工农兵的思想感情，工农兵作者也在专业作者的帮助下开始写作质量较高的文艺作品。这一变化虽然刚刚开始。但是它对建立和繁荣社会主义的民族的新文化，将具有深刻的意义。这是值得提倡的一种创作方式。
