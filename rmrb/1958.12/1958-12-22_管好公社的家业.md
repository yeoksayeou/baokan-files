Manage the Public's Commune Assets Well
    Dīng Shān

The people's communes have vast properties. Doing a good job of the commune's financial work and managing such large assets is not an easy task.

The tasks of the commune's financial work are very heavy. It must be responsible for completing the state's fiscal revenue, and also for planning the commune's distribution and accumulation; it must ensure the supply of funds for the commune's production and construction, and also meet the needs of the commune's collective welfare undertakings and the individual lives of its members. Therefore, rectifying and strengthening the commune's financial work is of great importance to developing the commune's production, improving the lives of the members, and thus consolidating the commune.

How can we do a good job of the people's commune's financial work?

First, we must comprehensively understand and handle the relationship between production and distribution, and between accumulation and consumption. If someone one-sidedly emphasizes the state's fiscal revenue and is not actively expanding the commune's accumulation; or only emphasizes improving the lives of the members and is not enthusiastic about ensuring the supply of the commune's production investment; or only pays attention to the commune's production investment and does not attach importance to improving the lives of the members... the result will inevitably be that the state's fiscal revenue cannot be increased, the commune's production cannot be developed, and the lives of the members cannot be improved. Because what determines the amount of fiscal revenue is production, and the material basis for improving the lives of the members is also production. Of course, if the lives of the members are not improved, it will be difficult to do a good job of production. Therefore, when we handle any financial work, we must simultaneously think of the relationship between accumulation and consumption, production and life, etc., and we must simultaneously think of the interests of the state, the commune, and the members. Only in this way can we prevent one-sided viewpoints.

Second, in all financial work, we must resolutely implement the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily. If someone thinks that the commune has vast properties and it doesn't matter if we spend a little more; or that production has made a great leap forward, and life should also be ostentatious, this is wrong. Although China's industrial and agricultural production has achieved significant achievements this year, with grain, cotton, steel and other productions doubling, the situation of "poverty and blankness" has not fundamentally changed. Running all undertakings diligently and thriftily is the Party's policy, and we must implement it in all our work; especially financial workers, we need to abide by this principle at all times.

Third, democratic financial management is an important link in doing a good job of financial work. We must adopt various forms to absorb the masses to participate in the management and supervision of financial work, so that everyone cares about finance and everyone supervises finance. Today's news published in this newspaper introduces some experiences in this area, which is worth paying attention to.

    管好公社的家业  
    丁山
    人民公社家大业大，做好公社的财务工作，管好这么大的家业，可不是一件容易事。
    公社财务工作的任务很繁重，它既要负责完成国家的财政收入，又要负责计划公社的分配和积累；既要保证公社生产建设资金的供应，又要满足公社集体福利事业和社员个人生活的需要。因此，整顿和加强公社的财务工作，对发展公社的生产，改善社员的生活，也就是巩固公社有重要作用。
    怎样做好人民公社的财务工作呢？
    第一、必须全面地认识和处理生产和分配、积累和消费之间的关系。如果有人片面地看重了国家财政收入，对扩大公社积累不积极；或者是只强调改善社员生活，对保证公社生产投资的供应不热心；或者是只注意公社生产投资，而不重视改善生活；……其结果必然是国家财政收入不能增加，公社生产不能发展，社员生活不能改善。因为决定财政收入多或少的是生产，而社员生活改善的物质基础也是生产，当然，社员生活不改善，要搞好生产是有困难的。因此，我们在处理任何一项财务工作时，必须同时想到积累和消费、生产和生活等方面的关系，必须同时想到国家、公社和社员三方面的利益，只有这样才能防止片面观点。
    第二、在一切财务工作中，要坚决贯彻勤俭办社的原则。如果有人认为公社家大业大，多花点没什么；或者是生产大跃进了，生活也要讲排场。这是错误的。今年我国工农业生产虽然取得了重大成就，粮食、棉花、钢铁等生产都翻了一番，但是“一穷二白”的局面还没有根本改变。勤俭办一切事业是党的方针，我们必须贯彻到一切工作中去；尤其是财务工作人员，更需要时时遵守这个原则。
    第三、财务管理民主化，是做好财务工作的重要一环。要采取多种形式，吸收群众参加管理和监督财务工作，让人人关心财务，人人监督财务。今天本报发表的消息中，介绍了一些这一方面的经验，值得重视。
