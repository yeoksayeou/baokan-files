    Red Tidings of Joy
    Zang Kejia
    Snowflakes flutter in the sky,
    Molten iron splashes from the brick furnace,
    The iron bar is swung incessantly,
    The blower roars with all its might in jubilation.

    The temperature drops bit by bit,
    Winter reigns in the courtyard;
    But spring is in our hearts,
    Enthusiasm soars straight upwards.

    Returning with joy,
    We brush the snowflakes off our bodies,
    The telephone rings merrily,
    Excitedly calling out to people.

  “We bring you great tidings of joy,
  ‘1070’ has been achieved!
  This is a great scientific figure,
  And the most moving poetic material.”
  Hearing this great tidings of joy,
  The people of the whole nation rejoice greatly,

  “1070” has become a steel fact,
  No longer just a hoped-for indicator.
  I think of the workers sweating beside the converter,
  I think of the thousands upon thousands of warriors fighting hard day and night for steel;
  I think of the international friends who are steelmaking with us,
  I think of those Young Pioneers whose fingers were cut picking up iron nails…
  Although our small earthen furnace is very small,
  We also have a share in the success,
  “1070,” oh, red tidings of joy,
  Illuminates China,
  Illuminates every heart.

    红色喜报
    臧克家 天空里雪花飘飘，砖炉里铁花飞爆，手里铁钎不停地挥动，鼓风机鼓足劲儿在欢叫。温度一点点下降，庭院里是严冬；心窝里却是春天，热情直线地上升。带着快乐归来，把身上的雪花拍掉，电话铃声叮铃铃，欢狂地把人喊叫。
  “给你送一个大喜报，‘1070’已经拿下来了，这是伟大的科学数字，也是最动人的诗料”。听了这个大喜报，全国人民大欢跃，
  “1070”成了钢的事实，不再是一个希望的指标。我想起了站在转炉旁挥汗的工人，我想起了日夜为钢苦战的千千万万战士
  们；我想起了国际友人和我们一道炼钢的情
  景，我想起了那些为捡铁钉划破了手指的红
  领巾……我们的小土炉虽然很小，成功里也有我们的一份，“1070”呵，红色的大喜报，映红了中国，映红了每一颗心。
