Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 20th - Reporters Shi Zhengyao and Chen Huaining report: The Beijing Brigade of the Red Star Commune in Liujiang County, Guangxi, has adopted a "five-link" approach, centered on the canteen, with supply and marketing points, bathrooms, laundry and mending groups, and reading rooms established nearby. In this way, commune members feel that all aspects of their lives have become more convenient.

The fourteen public canteens of the Beijing Brigade have a total of more than 120 mu of vegetable plots, planted with various vegetables, and also raise chickens and pigs. The commune members eat well and are full. However, simply running the canteen well is not enough to properly solve other problems in the lives of commune members. For example, in the production team, sometimes people have to ask for leave to go to the market, running several miles back and forth to buy daily necessities and other things, which not only delays production but also makes commune members feel troubled. Some women have to wash and sew clothes when they return from work, and they cannot get enough rest at night. Under the care and leadership of the Party branch, the brigade, after continuous research and supplementation, finally gradually implemented the above-mentioned "five-link" approach.

The reporters visited the "five-link" system run by the Shanwan Team of the commune. Next to the kitchen of the public canteen, there is a hot water room, where hot water is boiled every morning and evening for commune members to wash their faces and bathe. Every evening, after returning from work, commune members take hot baths in the separate male and female bathrooms. Then, they send their clothes to the laundry and mending group, and they are generally washed clean the next day. The laundry and mending group has sewing machines, and there are two rows of wooden shelves on the wall, with the names of many commune members written in separate compartments. The mended clothes are placed according to the name for the commune members to pick up themselves. Because there are dedicated people to take care of it, everyone in the village, old and young, is dressed relatively cleanly and neatly. The supply and marketing points sell all kinds of commodities, both food and daily necessities. If the supply and marketing point does not have what the commune member wants, the salesperson will help him to find it from the supply and marketing cooperative. When commune member Tan Yiqiong was getting married, the supply and marketing cooperative helped her buy chicken and meat, and the cooks prepared the dishes, allowing her relatives and friends to have a lively wedding feast. The reading room is filled with more than 100 popular science and technology books on industry and agriculture, children's books, and magazines, specially for commune members to read during breaks before and after meals.

The Beijing Brigade had already organized nurseries, so after the implementation of the canteen's "five-link" system, commune members, especially women, no longer had to worry about eating, sewing, or taking care of their children. The women said: Now we don't have to pay for meals, someone takes care of the children, and we don't have to worry about washing and mending. The only thing we worry about is not being able to keep up with others in production. The enthusiasm of the commune members for production is very high. In addition, because the worries of housework have been reduced, commune members not only have enough time to rest, but also have half an hour of reading the newspaper at noon every day, and can also study culture and politics in the evening.

"The canteen is really good, we never expected it before; there are many kinds of food, everything is delicious; it's like celebrating the New Year every day, we eat well and are full; where does happiness come from? From the good leadership of the Party!" This is the song of the broad masses of commune members to the commune canteen.

    围绕食堂建立供销点、洗澡室、洗衣补衣组和阅览室
    社员个个方便  人人干劲十足
    红星公社北京大队关心社员生活推动了生产
    新华社南宁20日电  记者施峥尧、陈怀宁报道：广西柳江县红星公社北京大队采取“五连环”的办法，以食堂为中心，附近设立供销点、洗澡室、洗衣补衣组和阅览室。这样，社员们各方面的生活都感到更加方便了。
    北京大队的十四个公共食堂，共有一百二十多亩菜地，种有各种蔬菜，还养了鸡和猪。社员吃得好，吃得饱。但是仅仅办好食堂，还不能妥善地解决社员生活上的其他问题。例如在中队里，有时有人要请假去赶圩，来回跑好几里地去买点日用品之类的东西，不仅耽误生产，社员也嫌麻烦。有些妇女劳动回来还得洗衣缝衣，晚上不能充分休息。在党支部的关心和领导下，这个大队经过不断研究和补充，最后逐步实行了上述“五连环”的办法。
    记者访问了这个公社山湾中队办的“五连环”。只见公共食堂的厨房旁边有个热水房，每天早晚烧热水给社员洗脸、洗澡。社员们每天傍晚劳动回来，就分别在男女洗澡房里洗热水澡，然后，把换下来的衣服送到洗衣补衣组去，一般第二天就洗干净了。洗衣补衣组里有缝纫机，墙上有两排木板架子，上面分格写上许多社员的名字，补好的衣服就按名放好，让社员自己来领取。因为有专人在料理，所以这个村子老老少少个个都穿得比较干净和整齐。供销点里卖着吃的用的各式商品。如果社员要的东西供销点一时没有，售货员便替他到供销社去筹办。社员谭易琼要结婚，供销社就帮她买鸡买肉，炊事员给做好了菜，让她的亲戚朋友热热闹闹吃喜酒。阅览室里边摆着一百多本工农业科学技术通俗读物、儿童书籍和杂志等，专门供社员们在饭前饭后休息时阅读。
    北京大队早就组织了托儿所，所以在实行食堂“五连环”以后，社员们特别是妇女，再也没有吃、缝补等家务和孩子的牵挂了。妇女们说：现在吃饭不要钱，孩子有人带，洗洗补补一样也不用操心，就是操心生产赶不上别人。公社社员们生产积极性都很高。此外，由于减少了家务的牵挂，社员们不仅比较有足够的时间休息，而且每天中午还有半小时的读报时间，晚上还能学习文化和政治。（附图片）
    “食堂真正好，从前盼不到；饭菜种类多，样样有味道；天天如过年，吃的饱又好；幸福那里来，党的好领导！”这是广大社员对公社食堂的歌颂。上图：河南孟津横水乡红旗人民公社的社员，正在吃他们喜欢吃的饭菜。右图：北京海淀人民公社青龙桥工作站第一连的食堂开饭了。瞧，炊事员在多么紧张地工作啊！
