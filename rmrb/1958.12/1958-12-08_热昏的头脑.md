    Brain Fever
    In the West, all sorts of nerve warfare to obstruct the settlement of the West Berlin issue are being deployed. The author of an article in the American "Washington Star" has come up with an even more original idea. He advocates launching a "freedom movement" to "liberate" Eastern Europe to counter the proposal to turn West Berlin into a "free city."
    This cold war expert says that "the secret of successful propaganda is to repeatedly reiterate" this "concept of liberation" "especially at moments that have a major impact on the psyche." He talks at length about his business of using West Berlin's "freedom" to exchange for a "completely free Europe." However, the Soviet government's proposal to make West Berlin a "free city" is to liberate the people of West Berlin from the military occupation of Western countries and to live freely from the control of Western countries; but the author of the "Washington Star" said this: A truly free country is one like West Germany that allows foreign troops to continue to be stationed on its territory.
    It turns out that this "freedom movement" adviser with a brain fever not only wants American troops to continue to be stationed in West Berlin, but also wants American troops to be stationed in "a completely free Europe." Unfortunately, this scheme is not new at all, it is just an old product of Washington's most feverish brains.

    热昏的头脑
    在西方，各色各样阻挠解决西柏林问题的神经战，都施展出来了。美国“华盛顿明星报”一篇文章的作者，更是别出心裁。他主张发动一次“解放”东欧的“自由运动”，来对抗把西柏林变为“自由城市”的建议。
    这位冷战专家说，“成功的宣传秘诀就是不厌其烦地反复申述”这个“解放的概念”，“特别是对心理发生重大影响的时刻”。他大谈其用西柏林的“自由”来换取“全部自由的欧洲”的生意经。可是，苏联政府提出使西柏林成为“自由城市”的建议，是要使西柏林人民从西方国家的军事占领下解放出来，摆脱西方国家的控制而自由生活；而“华盛顿明星报”的作者却这样说：真正自由的国家，就是像西德那样让外国军队继续驻在它的领土上。
    原来这位热昏了头脑的“自由运动”的献计人，不仅是要让美国的军队继续驻在西柏林，而且还想让美国军队进驻“全部自由的欧洲”。可惜这个计谋一点也不新奇，这只是华盛顿最热昏的头脑的旧产物。
