Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th. According to TASS Moscow: The Central Statistical Bureau of the USSR Council of Ministers announced that Soviet light industry and the food industry have completed the 1958 production plans for various important industrial products and foods ahead of schedule.

Due to further achievements in developing agriculture and producing consumer goods, as well as increased resident income, the 1958 state retail commodity turnover plan was also completed ahead of schedule. Compared with last year, the commodity turnover increased by 6% at comparable prices, and 7% if vodka (whose sales volume decreased) is not included. According to statistics from the Central Statistical Bureau, the retail commodity turnover in 1958 was approximately 670 billion rubles.

Today's "Pravda" published an editorial on this matter, stating that in Khrushchev's report outline on the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965, the tasks of greatly improving the food supply to residents and ensuring the supply of durable and beautiful clothing and shoes to the Soviet people were put forward. In the next seven years, measures to further improve people's welfare are also planned. These measures relate to all aspects of the working people's lives: improving and properly organizing the payment of wages and pensions, improving working conditions, shortening working days and weeks, improving housing conditions, improving commercial services for residents, and improving healthcare conditions. The newspaper emphasized that the transition to shortening working days and reducing the number of working days per week will be carried out without reducing wages.

Speaking of the tasks of retail commerce, "Pravda" pointed out that in the next seven years (1959-1965), the total retail commodity turnover of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce will increase by 57% to 62% at comparable prices. During these seven years, the amount of livestock products sold to residents will increase by 1.2 times, vegetable oil will increase by almost one time, and fruits and citrus fruits will increase by two times. In addition, the sales volume of fabrics, clothing, shirts, and shoes will be greatly increased, and more household goods and cultural goods that can alleviate women's housework will be supplied.

    苏联轻工业和食品工业生产计划提前完成
    国家零售商品流转额有很大增加
    新华社29日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议中央统计局宣布，苏联轻工业和食品工业提前完成了1958年各种最重要的工业品和食品的生产计划。
    由于在发展农业和生产消费品方面取得了进一步的成就以及居民收入的增加，使1958年国家零售商品流转的计划也提前完成了。同去年相比，商品流转额以比较价格计算增加了6％，如果不把伏特加（它的销售量降低了）算在内，则增加了7％。据中央统计局统计，1958年零售商品流转额大约为六千七百亿卢布。
    今天“真理报”就这件事发表社论说，在赫鲁晓夫关于1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济控制数字的报告提纲中，提出了大大改善居民食品供应以及保证供应苏联人民以耐用美观的衣服和鞋类的任务。在未来的七年中，还拟订了进一步增进人民福利的措施。这些措施涉及到劳动人民生活的一切方面：提高以及正确组织发放工资和优恤金的工作，改善劳动条件，缩短工作日和工作周，改善居住条件，改善对居民的商业服务，以及改善保健条件等。报纸强调指出，向缩短工作日和减少一周的工作日数的过渡将在不降低工资的条件下进行。
    在谈到零售商业的任务时，“真理报”指出，在今后七年中（1959年—1965年），国营商业和合作社商业的零售商品流转总额以比较价格计算将增加57％到62％。在这七年中出售给居民的畜产品将增加一点二倍，植物油将增加差不多一倍，水果和柑桔增加二倍。此外，将大大增加布匹、衣服、衬衣和鞋类的出售量，并且更多地供应能够减轻妇女家务劳动的家庭用品和文化生活用品。
