"Unsuitable to Travel"
    董逢亚

    Let's assume that there really is a distinction between auspicious and inauspicious days. Then, for the American lords, all three hundred and sixty-five days of the year are "unsuitable to travel." As for what the 29th of February in a leap year is like, it is still uncertain.

    Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, Mr. Dulles' "virtuous younger brother" -- the one who engages in espionage -- and Murphy, who is revered as a "skillful problem solver," have traveled to different places on different days, but they have all encountered varying degrees of bad luck. The heavy ones were rotten eggs, stones, and rotten tomatoes, and the light ones were black纱 (gauze, used as mourning veils), and slogans.

    Recently, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree, as a U.S. special envoy, went to Iraq again. Let me copy a few excerpts from the dispatches to show you what kind of "reception" he received:

    Agence France-Presse said: Rountree had to detour into the city when he arrived at Baghdad Airport. But he couldn't avoid it. "Several thousand people gathered at the airport, and the police had to escort Rountree from the back door, through streets lined with hostile demonstrators, all the way to the American Embassy, which looked like a barracks with armored units stationed in the garden." "The crowd surrounded his car and spat on it."

    Reuters said: "Originally, he was going to use the chargé d'affaires' car, which he had taken from the airport yesterday." But, "the windshield of this car was broken, apparently yesterday when demonstrators threw clods of earth at the car." Also, "newspapers and the public have spent four days condemning his visit and demanding that he go back." As a result, U.S. Embassy officials "expressed displeasure," and Rountree also felt sad.

    The Associated Press said, "Iraqi youth mobs (please note, only the Associated Press calls them mobs) threw mud balls, eggs and stones at Rountree, but none hit him. The rioters shouted 'Rountree go back!'" Therefore, the U.S. State Department expressed "regret."

    Finally, let me add a piece of news from the East: The Iraqi "Revolutionary Newspaper" commented that Rountree fled from the crowd yesterday, although the crowd never intended to hurt him, but only intended to yell "go back" at him. The newspaper asked: What does American imperialism want Iraq to do? "Do they want Iraq to abandon its free, democratic national policy and return to a state of enslavement? If so, why did we have a revolution?"

    "Displeasure," "sadness," and "regret" are all useless. Shouldn't the Iraqi people treat the "envoys of conspiracy and war" who want them to "return to a state of enslavement" in this way?

    Reading these news items, in addition to expressing admiration for the Iraqi people's just and heroic struggle, I am also very happy because it allows us to see that: the "paper tiger" can be punctured not only on the battlefield, but also in another occasion; the problem lies only in whether people want to puncture it!

    "Unsuitable to travel" days are naturally "very difficult." But, since it is "rotting day by day," how can it not be like this?

### “不宜出行”

    “不宜出行”
    董逢亚
    假设，真的有什么黄道日或黑道日的区分的话，那末，一年三百六十五天，对于美国老爷们都是“不宜出行”的。至于闰年的2月29日那一天怎么样，现在还说不定。
    副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯、杜勒斯先生的“贤弟”——那个搞特务工作的，以及被尊称为“善于处理困难问题的能手”的墨菲，在不同的日子里，到过不同的地方，但是，却都碰到了程度不同的霉气。重的是臭蛋，石块，烂西红柿，轻的是黑纱、标语。
    最近，美国助理国务卿朗特里，又以美国特使的身份到了伊拉克。受到了怎样的“接待”，抄几段电讯给大家看看吧：
    法新社说：朗特里到达巴格达机场时，曾不得不绕道进城。但是，绕也绕不过。“好几千人聚结在机场，警察不得不护送朗特里从后门离开，通过两旁站满了怀着敌意的示威者的大街，一直送到美国大使馆，美国大使馆看上去像一座兵营，花园里驻有装甲部队。”“群众包围了他的汽车，对汽车吐唾沫。”
    路透社说：“本来他要用代办的车子，他昨天就是乘代办的车子从机场前来的”。但是，“这辆车子的风挡打碎了，这显然是在昨天被示威者用土块掷车子时打碎的。”还有，“报纸和公众都已经用了四天的时间来谴责他的访问，要求他滚回去。”于是，美国大使馆官员们“表示不快”，而朗特里也感到难过了。
    美联社说，“伊拉克的青年暴民（请读者注意，只有美联社称他们为暴民）纷纷以泥球、鸡蛋和石头向朗特里投去，但是都没有打中他。暴徒高呼‘朗特里滚回去’。”因此，美国国务院表示“遗憾”。
    最后加一条东方的消息吧：伊拉克的“革命报”评论说：朗特里昨天逃离了群众，虽然群众决没有想伤害他，只不过是打算向他吼几声“滚回去”而已。这家报纸问道：美帝国主义想要伊拉克做些什么？“他们是不是想要伊拉克放弃它的自由、民主的民族政策，而回到受奴役的状态。这样，我们为什么要革命？”
      “不快”也罢，“难过”也罢，“遗憾”也罢，又顶什么用？难道伊拉克人不应该这样对待要他们“回到受奴役状态”的“阴谋和战争的使节”么？
    读着这些消息，除了对伊拉克人民的正义和英勇斗争表示钦佩以外，还感到十分高兴，因为，它使我们看到：“纸老虎”除了在战场上可以戳破以外，在另一种场合也是可以戳破的；问题只在于要人们去戳！
    “不宜出行”的日子，自然“很不好过”。但是，既然“一天天烂下去”，又怎能不这样呢？
