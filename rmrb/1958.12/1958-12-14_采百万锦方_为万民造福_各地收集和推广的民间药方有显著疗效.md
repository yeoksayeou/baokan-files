Collecting a Million Wonderful Prescriptions for the Benefit of the People
Folk Prescriptions Collected and Promoted in Various Regions Show Significant Efficacy

(Our report) The "Million Wonderful Prescriptions" campaign to collect folk remedies, secret prescriptions, effective prescriptions, and medical techniques, aimed at exploring the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine, has yielded significant results. According to incomplete statistics, hundreds of thousands of various prescriptions have been collected across the country so far.

In recent years, health departments in various regions have been paying attention to collecting folk prescriptions. By 1957, twenty-three provinces and cities across the country had categorized, screened, and organized the collected prescriptions, publishing compilations of verified and secret Chinese medicine prescriptions, providing valuable resources for clinical treatment. Especially after the rectification campaign and the thorough dismantling of bourgeois medical authorities, various regions have attached greater importance to traditional Chinese medicine, successively launching mass campaigns to collect folk remedies, secret prescriptions, effective prescriptions, and medical techniques. During the collection process, various regions widely implemented the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, dispatching cadres to go deep into rural areas and streets to visit the wise and collect prescriptions, widely publicizing the important significance of contributing prescriptions and skills to safeguarding the people's health, patiently helping some people dispel concerns about how contributing prescriptions would affect their income and work, and also taking measures to solve some practical problems. In this way, the work of collecting prescriptions in various regions has been carried out smoothly. Since October, Fujian Province alone has collected more than 700,000 pieces of traditional Chinese medicine folk remedies, verified prescriptions, and secret prescriptions (unprocessed, including duplicates), and more than 600 copies of ancient and handwritten medical books. Medical books such as Secret Prescriptions of the Imperial Hospital, Hua Tuo's Heritage, and Secret Books of the Shaolin Temple are rare and unique. Under the slogan of "Everyone Contributes Prescriptions, Everyone Contributes Treasures," Hebei Province has collected and sorted out more than 160,000 various prescriptions. Liaoning, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangxi, Shanghai and other provinces and cities have also collected a large number of prescriptions.

Many of the folk prescriptions collected in various regions have been passed down from generation to generation and have undergone long-term repeated practice, with significant curative effects. They can be said to be treasures in traditional Chinese medicine. Many folk prescriptions have special curative effects on diseases that are difficult to treat with Western medicine. For example, the ancestral secret prescription "San Xian Dan" and "Qing Xue Sou Du Wan" for treating syphilis, contributed by Sheng Zizhang, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Longhua County, Hebei Province, completely eliminated the current symptoms of syphilis within forty days after being promoted throughout the province. The Xian County People's Hospital in this province also used the folk remedy soybean oil to cure a patient with mesenteric thrombosis, a disease that Western medicine was unable to treat. The ancestral secret prescription for treating nephritis contributed by Mrs. Lu in Guizhou Province saved critically ill patients. The Lanzhou Infectious Disease Hospital cured forty-four cases of scarlet fever with the single herbal remedy Coptis chinensis, which had a shorter course of treatment than Western medicines penicillin and sulfa drugs. Other prescriptions such as Lysimachia christinae for treating gallstones, chicken gallbladder for treating whooping cough, walnut milk for treating urethral stones, Stellera chamaejasme for treating tuberculous lymphadenitis, and Paeonia suffruticosa or Clerodendrum trichotomum for treating hypertension are also remarkably effective.

The discovery, collection, and dissemination of a large number of folk prescriptions has not only provided rich data for the study of traditional Chinese medicine but has also had a significant and immediate impact on safeguarding the people's health and promoting socialist construction. For example, during the influenza epidemic in Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province last winter and this spring, the epidemic was quickly controlled by drinking water infused with Cynomorium songaricum based on a folk prescription and by using folk acupuncture methods. During the typhoid epidemic in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province this year, more than 80% of the patients were cured with the folk prescription "Chai Hu Tang." A traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Changting, Fujian, contributed a single herbal remedy of "鹅不食" (Centipeda minima), which cured dozens of whooping cough patients in the local area at that time.

While collecting prescriptions, various regions have been organizing and promoting the collected prescriptions. Hebei Province has established a provincial-level traditional Chinese medicine research network to organize, study, and promote the collected prescriptions. Fujian Province is selecting and categorizing the wonderful prescriptions to be printed into "Fujian Folk Remedies, Secret Prescriptions, and Verified Prescriptions" quick reports to be sent to various places for research; and is adopting the method of "using local materials and trying them locally," with various places trying them for a period of time before summarizing, improving, and promoting them.

    采百万锦方  为万民造福
    各地收集和推广的民间药方有显著疗效
    本报讯  为发掘祖国医药宝库而开展的收集民间单方、秘方、验方和医疗技术的“百万锦方”采风工作，已有很大的成果。据不完全统计，目前全国各地收集到的各种药方已经有数十万件。
    几年来，各地卫生部门都在注意收集民间药方。到1957年，全国已有二十三个省市把收集到的药方分门别类加以审选整理，出版了中医验方秘方汇编，为临床治疗提供了宝贵的资料。特别是经过整风运动和大破资产阶级医药权威以后，各地对祖国医学更加重视，相继展开了群众性的收集民间单方、秘方、验方和医疗技术的采风。采风过程中，各地广泛贯彻党的中医政策，抽调干部深入农村和街道访贤采风，对献方献技的人广泛宣传献方献技对保障人民健康的重要意义，耐心地帮助某些人打消怕献方后影响收入和影响工作的思想顾虑，同时还采取措施解决一些实际问题。这样，各地采集药方的工作就顺利开展起来了。福建省从10月份起到目前为止，就收集到中医单方、验方、秘方七十多万件（未经整理，其中有重复的药方），古本、手抄本医书六百多册。医书中如太医院秘方、华陀遗传、少林寺秘本等，都是罕见的孤本秘籍。河北省在“人人献方，个个献宝”的号召下，收集整理了各种药方十六万多件。辽宁、贵州、江苏、湖南、广西、上海等省区市也收集了大量药方。
    各地采集到的民间药方，其中许多都是代代相传，经过了长时期的反复实践，有显著的疗效，可以说是祖国医药学中的珍宝。有许多民间药方对西医难以医治的病症，有治疗特效。如河北省隆化县中医盛子章献出的治疗梅毒祖传秘方“三仙丹”和“清血搜毒丸”，在全省推广后，四十天内就全部消灭了现症梅毒。这个省的献县人民医院也用民间单方豆油治好了西医束手的害肠系膜血栓病的病人。贵州省卢老太太献出的祖传治疗肾脏炎秘方，挽救了危急病人。兰州传染病医院用黄连单方治愈猩红热四十四例，比西药青霉素、?胺的疗程还短。其他如金钱草治疗胆结石，鸡苦胆治疗百日咳，胡桃乳治疗尿道结石，狼毒枣治疗淋巴腺结核，牡丹皮或臭梧桐治疗高血压等药方都有奇效。
    大量民间药方的发现、收集和传播，除了为研究祖国医学提供了丰富的资料外，对保障人民健康和促进社会主义建设事业，已经立竿见影地发生了显著的成效。如去冬今春河北省保定专区流行性感冒大流行，用民间药方管仲泡水喝和用民间针灸方法治疗，就迅速控制了流行性感冒的流行。在今年河北省邯郸专区伤寒流行中，有80％以上的病人是用民间药方“柴胡汤”治好的。福建长汀一个中医献出的“鹅不食”草药单方，当时就治愈了当地几十个百日咳患者。
    各地在采风的同时，对收集到的药方进行整理和推广。河北省已建立起全省性中医研究网，整理研究和推广已收集的药方。福建省正在把锦方选择归类，印成“福建民间单方、秘方、验方”快报，发往各地研究；并采取“就地取材，就地试用”的办法，由各地试用一个时期后，再总结、提高、推广。（附图片）
