According to a report in the Hebei Daily, the Xujiazhuang Red Flag People's Commune in Hengshui County used the method of "replacing men with women," vigorously promoting the "thirty-six occupations," enabling both male and female full and half laborers to give full play to their abilities and be properly placed. This sent strong laborers to the front line and powerfully promoted the simultaneous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

The Xujiazhuang Red Flag Commune has a total of 26,700 male and female full and half laborers, of which 15,141 are female laborers. Each laborer is responsible for an average of 8.15 mu of land. With the establishment of the commune, industrial and agricultural production developed at high speed. The commune established 4,200 medium and small-sized factories, and 32 livestock farms, chicken farms, pig farms, agricultural experiment stations, etc. on the beaches and alkaline land. At the same time, supply and marketing outlets, sales points, and credit stations were set up in each work station and production team, totaling 109. Service industries, together with diverse economic, supply and marketing, credit, breeding, handicraft and other departments, occupied 4,628 male laborers. In addition, more than 5,100 strong laborers were transferred to support steel production and water conservancy construction. Male laborers regularly participating in agricultural production accounted for only about 20% of the total labor force. The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production conflicted with the lack of labor.

In order to solve this contradiction, the commune party committee adopted the measure of "replacing men with women" and vigorously promoted the "thirty-six occupations," organizing women to take over various service industries and social labor within their capabilities. After two months of work, 6,500 women in the commune had taken on jobs such as business, postal delivery, telephone operation, cooking, pickling vegetables, hairdressing, breeding, machinery, agricultural technology, driving, newspaper promotion, sewing, education, nursing, health care, childcare, accounting, statistics, drafting, credit, breeding, film projection, performance, dispensing medicine, meteorology, photography, road maintenance, management, receiving and dispatching, safekeeping, archives, document printing, book explanation, painting, glass installation, and other work. Five thousand male laborers were successively freed up to support steel production and invest in farmland water conservancy infrastructure construction.

The work of replacing men with women and vigorously promoting the "thirty-six occupations" was actively supported by many people, especially the broad masses of women, when it was proposed. However, some people still had ideological concerns and misunderstandings. Some cadres in enterprises and departments believed that women had less ability, lower levels of education, less professional knowledge, and were entangled in trivial household affairs, making them difficult to lead and causing losses in work. Some cadres in production teams were afraid that transferring women with culture and strong physiques from their teams would affect the production of their teams. Some women also believed that these jobs were not glorious and had no future.

In order to solve these ideological problems, the Red Flag People's Commune Party Committee held meetings of cadres from various production teams and main cadres from various departments three times, repeatedly clarifying the important significance of replacing men with women, and widely and deeply conducted publicity among the masses, focusing on questions such as "Why replace men with women?" "Can women undertake the 'thirty-six occupations'?" and "How should everyone treat this work?" During the debates, everyone used many vivid facts to illustrate that women could shoulder various jobs. For example, female tractor driver Liu Huanying plowed the land both well and quickly; female diesel engine operators saved fuel and irrigated more land. These many facts showed that replacing men with women was precisely to strengthen production. In the debates, everyone also clarified the principles that there is no distinction between noble and lowly in various undertakings of socialist construction. This improved the ideological awareness of the broad masses of commune members and unified their understanding. Male salesperson Zhang Zhongjie of the supply and marketing cooperative said: "In the past, I only planned for myself and was unwilling to change jobs, which was wrong. I am strong and should go to the steel front." Many people also examined their past individualistic thinking. Some leading cadres examined their erroneous thinking of valuing men over women. The broad masses of women expressed their determination to the party branch and the women's federation, guaranteeing to obey the assignment and do their work well.

On the basis of raising awareness and unifying thinking, a "Replacing Men with Women" Committee was organized. Then, under the specific leadership of the Party Committee, the Women's Federation and the Commune Office uniformly allocated personnel. In order to ensure the quality of work, it was proposed that attention should be paid to good composition, good thinking, good labor, and appropriate age when transferring people to the thirty-six occupations. In order to make proper assignments and take care of specialties, everyone was asked to fill out a volunteer form, and finally allocated according to individual wishes and work needs. For the jobs of hairdresser, breeder, and cook, which were originally the most difficult to assign, the Commune Party Committee, on the one hand, held industry-specific symposiums to explain to everyone the great and glorious significance of the three jobs, and called on Party and League members to take the lead in doing them. At the same time, it also adopted the method of "husbands bringing wives" or discovering talent themselves and having the leadership approve it.

While arranging female labor, appropriate arrangements were also made for the original male labor. In addition to those assigned to support steel production, all others were invested in agricultural production and infrastructure construction.

In order to enable the "thirty-six occupations" to quickly become familiar with their work, the Commune Party Committee sent more than 20 women to other places to learn techniques such as projecting films and operating coal gas engines. On the other hand, it established a Red and Expert University, with departments such as chicken raising, pig raising, and finance and economics. It also established professional business research groups to study during spare time. At the same time, it launched a competition movement among the "thirty-six occupations" to learn business and do their jobs well. The women undertaking the "thirty-six occupations" were full of energy and worked hard. Salespersons familiarized themselves with commodity prices during the day, and studied commodity performance, origin, and characteristics in groups at night. Hairdresser Li Junwen learned a complete set of hairdressing techniques in less than thirty days. Salespersons Duan Shukun and Zhang Shuyin cordially served customers and set up tea for customers. Their department store group was rated by the masses as a "Home for Customers," and has received more than one hundred letters of praise.

The time since the implementation of "replacing men with women" has not been long, but it has shown the following effects: (1) It has tapped labor potential and solved the contradiction between the simultaneous leap forward in industry and agriculture and the lack of labor. (2) After postal workers, salespersons, and other members of the "thirty-six occupations" were contracted by women, the young and middle-aged male laborers freed up were invested in steelmaking and well drilling, one person doing the work of two. (3) It has fully mobilized the enthusiasm of women. After taking on new jobs, everyone is energetic and vigorous. Zhang Qingzhu became familiar with accounting subjects half a month after becoming an accountant. (4) It has better arranged the lives of commune members. After women took on the job of cook, the variety of food increased. After women organized sewing factories and shoe factories, more than 60% of commune members wore cotton clothes made by the sewing workers. Every young and middle-aged laborer participating in production has two sets of cotton clothes, which greatly encouraged their production enthusiasm. (5) It has opened up broad avenues for women to participate in social labor and improve their cultural and technical levels, enabling their cultural, theoretical, and scientific and technical levels to improve rapidly. (6) It has improved the political status of women and promoted family harmony and unity. In the past, Li Guiju participated in less labor because of her weak body, and her husband said she ate for nothing, causing quarrels all day long. Now she is a breeder and does not feel overly tired. Since then, her husband is happy and the whole family is harmonious. (7) It has begun to change social customs, and a new atmosphere of men and women learning from each other and promoting each other has emerged. Many men humbly learn from women's enthusiasm and meticulousness for work, while women sincerely ask men for advice on some technical issues, thereby achieving mutual learning and common improvement.

    衡水红旗公社抽男换女全面调整劳动力
    六千妇女包干“后方”工作  大批男劳力走上生产前线
    据河北日报消息  衡水县徐家庄红旗人民公社用“抽男换女”的方法，大搞“三十六员”，使男女整半劳力达到了各尽所能、各得其所，把强劳力送到了第一线，有力地推动了工农业生产同时跃进。
    徐家庄红旗公社共有男女整半劳力二万六千七百名，其中妇女劳力一万五千一百四十一名。每个劳力平均负担八点一五亩。随着公社的建立，工农业生产高速度发展，全社建立了中、小型工厂四千二百座，在沙滩、碱地上建立了畜牧场、鸡场、猪场、农业试验场等三十二处，同时还在各工作站、生产队分设了供销门市部、销售点、信用站等一百零九个。服务性的行业连同多种经济、供销、信用、饲养、手工业等部门，共占用着男劳力四千六百二十八个，再加上五千一百多个壮劳力外调支援钢铁生产、水利建设，经常参加农业生产的男劳力仅占总劳力的20％左右。工农业生产飞跃发展与劳力缺乏发生矛盾。
    为了解决这个矛盾，公社党委采取了“抽男换女”大搞“三十六员”的措施。组织妇女大包各种服务行业和力所能及的社会劳动。经过两个月的工作，全社已有六千五百名妇女，承担了营业、邮递、话务、炊事、腌菜、理发、饲养、机械、农业技术、驾驶、报刊推广、缝纫、教养、护理、保健、保育、会计、统计、描图、信贷、配种、电影放映、表演、司药、气象、摄影、护路、管理、收发、保管、档案、文印、图书讲解、油漆、玻璃安装等工作，先后抽出五千个男劳力，支援钢铁生产和投入农田水利基本建设。
    抽男换女，大搞“三十六员”的工作一提出，很多群众特别是广大妇女积极拥护。但也有些人存有思想顾虑和错误认识。有些企业部门干部认为妇女能力小，文化低，业务知识少，家务琐事纠缠，怕不好领导，工作受损失。有些生产队的干部怕把本队的有文化、体格壮的妇女调走后，影响本队的生产，有些妇女也认为这些工作不光彩、没前途。
    为了解决这些思想问题，红旗人民公社党委曾三次召开了各生产队干部和各部门主要干部会议，反复讲清了抽男换女的重要意义，并广泛深入地在群众中进行了宣传，以“为什么抽男换女”、“妇女能不能承担‘三十六员’”、“每个人应怎样对待这一工作”为题，进行了大鸣大放大辩论。在辩论中，大家用许多生动的事实说明了妇女能够担负各项工作。像女拖拉机手刘焕英耕地又好又快；女柴油机手们又省油，又浇的地多。这许多事实说明了以女换男正是为了加强生产。在辩论中，大家也明确了建设社会主义的各项事业，没有贵贱高低之分等道理。这样就提高了广大社员的思想觉悟，统一了认识。供销部男营业员张中洁说：“过去光为自己打算，不愿转业，是错误的。我身强力壮，应该到钢铁战线上去”。很多人也检查了过去的个人主义思想。有的领导干部，检查了自己重男轻女的错误思想。广大妇女纷纷向党支部、妇联表决心，保证听从分配，把工作作好。
    在觉悟提高、统一思想的基础上，又组织了“抽男换女”委员会，然后在党委的具体领导下，由妇联和公社办公室统一调配。为了保证工作质量，又提出抽调三十六员要注意成份好、思想好、劳动好、年龄适宜等条件。为了分配得当，照顾专长，让每个人都填写了志愿书，最后根据个人志愿和工作需要进行分配。原来最不好分配的理发员、配种员、炊事员工作，公社党委一方面通过按行业召开座谈会，向大家说明三项工作的重大和光荣意义，号召党、团员带头去作，同时还采取了“以夫带妻”或自己发现人材，领导批准的办法进行了安排。
    在安排妇女劳力的同时，对原来的男劳力也进行了适当安排，除分配到支援钢铁生产的以外，其他都投入了农业生产与基本建设。
    为了使“三十六员”很快的熟悉业务，公社党委一方面派出二十多名妇女到外地学习放映、开煤气机等技术；另一方面建立了红专大学，分设养鸡、养猪、财经等科系，并建立了专业业务研究小组，利用业余时间进行学习。同时，发动“三十六员”开展了学习业务、作好本职工作的竞赛运动。承担“三十六员”的妇女们，个个干劲十足，苦学苦练。售货员白天熟悉商品价格，晚上以组为单位学习商品性能、产地、特点；理发员李俊稳不到三十天学会了全套理发技术；售货员段淑昆、张淑印殷勤地招待顾客，并为顾客设了茶水，她们百货组被群众评为“顾客之家”，已经收到的表扬信达百多件。
    实现“抽男换女”的时间不长，但却显出了如下的作用：（一）挖掘了劳动潜力，解决了工农业同时跃进和劳力缺乏的矛盾。（二）邮递员、售货员等“三十六员”由妇女承包以后，腾出的青壮年男劳力投入炼钢、打机井，一个顶两个。（三）全面调动了妇女的积极性，她们担任了新的工作以后，个个精神焕发，生龙活虎。张青竹当了会计员以后，半个月就熟练了会计科目。（四）更好地安排了社员生活，妇女担任了炊事员以后，饭菜花样增多；妇女组织起缝纫厂、制鞋厂以后，已经有60％以上的社员穿上了缝纫员做的棉衣，参加生产的青壮年劳力，每人都备有两套棉衣，大大鼓励了他们的生产情绪。（五）为妇女参加社会劳动和提高文化技术水平，开辟了广阔的道路，使她们的文化、理论和科学技术水平迅速提高。（六）提高了妇女的政治地位，促进了家庭和睦团结。李桂菊过去因为身体弱，参加劳动少，丈夫说她白吃饭，整天闹别扭，现在担任了饲养员，她并不觉过于劳累，从此丈夫高兴，全家和睦了。（七）开始改变了社会风尚，出现了男女互相学习互相促进的新气象。很多男人虚心学习妇女对工作热心细心的特长，而妇女又诚恳地向男人请教一些技术问题，从而达到了互相学习共同提高。
