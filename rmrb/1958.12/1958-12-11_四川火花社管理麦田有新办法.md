According to the Sichuan Daily, in order to realize the plan for large-area and high-yield small spring crops next year, the Huohua People's Commune in Nanchong County, Sichuan, is currently carrying out new "suppressing seedling" measures for wheat in addition to doing a good job in field management such as ensuring full seedlings, topdressing fertilizer, intertillage, and pest control.

The masses have identified three benefits of this new yield-increasing measure: First, it can promote the development of wheat seedling roots, increase the number of fibrous roots, and extend them into the lower layers of the soil to absorb more water and nutrients from the soil, achieving deep roots and strong stalks to prevent lodging; second, it can make the wheat seedlings tiller earlier, tiller more, and be uniform and neat, which can achieve high yields; third, after suppressing the seedlings, the wheat seedlings are closer to the soil, which can retain water and fertilizer and reduce weed growth. According to the wheat seedlings that have already been suppressed in the cooperative, in just five days, 3% of each plant tillers two roots, and 5% tillers one root. Compared with those planted at the same time nearby, tillering can be advanced by ten to fifteen days. It is understood that suppressing seedlings can generally increase wheat ears by 20% per mu.

The method of suppressing seedlings is simple, generally there are two types, one is to step on it with your feet in one direction, and the other is to press it with a stone roller with a diameter of one foot five inches to two feet. The time for suppressing is generally controlled at about ten days after sowing, and it is appropriate to suppress when the base of the wheat seedlings is peeled open and the tillering buds emerge. However, before suppressing seedlings, the soil must be loosened and leveled to avoid damaging the wheat seedlings.

    四川火花社管理麦田有新办法
    据四川日报消息  四川南充县火花人民公社为了实现明年小春作物大面积高产计划，目前除作好全苗、追肥、中耕、治虫等田间管理外，对小麦采取了“压苗”的新措施。
    群众鉴定这一新的增产措施有三条好处：一，可以促使麦苗根部发达，增多须根，并伸入土壤下层多吸收土壤中的水分养料，达到根深秆壮不倒伏；二，能使麦苗分蘖早，分蘖多，而且均匀整齐，能获高产；三，压苗以后，麦苗靠近土壤，能保水保肥，减少杂草生长。根据社里已压的麦苗，仅五天时间每株分蘖两根的占3％，一根的占5％，与附近同时播种的比较，可提前十至十五天分蘖。据了解，通过压苗一般每亩可增加20％的麦穗。
    压苗的做法简单，一般有两种，一是顺着一个方向用脚踩，一种是用直径一尺五至二尺的石滚压。压的时间一般掌握在播种十天左右，剥开麦苗基部冒出分蘖嘴嘴时压为适宜。但压苗前，必须松土整平，以免压坏麦苗。
