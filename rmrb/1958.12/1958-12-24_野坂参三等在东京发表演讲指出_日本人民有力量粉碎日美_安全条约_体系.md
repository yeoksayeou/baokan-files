Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch from Tokyo: Nosaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said on the 22nd in Tokyo that as long as the Japanese people further unite, they will be able to stop the conspiracy of Japan and the U.S. to revise the "Security Treaty," shatter the "Security Treaty" system, and realize Japan's neutrality.

The Japanese Communist Party held a large rally in Tokyo on the 22nd to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Nosaka delivered a speech to more than 500 listeners.

In his speech entitled "The Current Political Situation in Japan and the Party's Mission," Nosaka pointed out that Japan is now at a critical juncture in choosing between two paths. One is to break the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system and move towards neutralization, a path supported by the people of China and the Soviet Union; the other is the path recently clamored by Dulles at the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" Council meeting, which is to allow the U.S. military to continue to occupy Japan.

Nosaka said that as long as the strength of the Japanese people united in the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" is further developed, it will not only be able to stop the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty," but also abolish the "Security Treaty" and realize Japan's neutralization. He said that only by taking this path can Japan get rid of the humiliating state of being subordinate to the United States. He said that this is the mission of the Japanese nation.

Miyamoto Kenji, Suzuki Ichizo, Hakamada Satomi, Kamiyama Shigeo, and other leading cadres of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee also delivered speeches at the rally. They unanimously called on the Japanese people not to relax their pursuit of the enemy, and at the same time to unite all patriotic and democratic forces and fight to the end for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

When Miyamoto spoke about Japan's move towards neutrality, he pointed out that neutrality is not to stand in the middle of peace and independence versus war and subordination, but to join hands with the people of all countries in the world and launch a struggle for peace together.

Suzuki Ichizo called on party activists to go deep among the masses to carry out propaganda movements so that all the people can thoroughly recognize the anti-national and anti-peace essence of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: Representatives of various organizations participating in the Tokyo Joint Struggle Conference against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" decided at a meeting held on the 20th that they will launch a struggle with opposition to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as their basic policy in the future.

Participants in the meeting included representatives from more than 20 organizations, including the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions, the Tokyo Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Tokyo Federation of the Japan-Korea Association, the Tokyo Council for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, the National Relief Association, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the joint struggle conferences in various districts.

The meeting decided that at present they should strive to strengthen the forces in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" in order to launch a struggle to demand the immediate cessation of the Japan-U.S. negotiations for the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan National Congress for Opening Japan-China Relations and Prohibiting Nuclear Armament Implementation Committee and the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, two organizations, recently jointly issued an appeal, calling on Japanese mass organizations and people from all walks of life to actively participate in the national movement against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and opening Japan-China relations.

The two organizations wrote this appeal based on the movement policy adopted at the joint meeting held on the 9th. The appeal elaborates in detail the goals and plans of the national joint struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and opening Japan-China relations.

More than 400 copies of the appeal were sent to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, various industrial trade unions, the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, youth, women, student, religious organizations, leaders of various organizations, and well-known people from all walks of life.

    野坂参三等在东京发表演讲指出
    日本人民有力量粉碎日美“安全条约”体系
    很多民主团体决定以反对日美“安全条约”为基本方针展开斗争
    新华社23日讯  东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三22日说，只要日本人民进一步团结起来，就能够阻止日美修改“安全条约”的阴谋，粉碎“安全条约”体系，实现日本的中立。
    日本共产党22日在东京举行废除日美“安全条约”大演讲会，野坂向五百多名听众发表了演讲。
    野坂在题为“目前日本的政局和党的使命”的演讲中指出，日本现在站在选择两条路的重要关头。一条是打破日美“安全条约”体系而走向中立化的道路，这条路有中苏两国人民的支持；另一条是杜勒斯最近在“北大西洋公约组织”理事会会议上叫嚣的让美军继续霸占日本的道路。
    野坂说，只要使日本人民在反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中所团结起来的力量得到进一步的发展，不仅能够阻止修改“安全条约”的阴谋，并且能够废除“安全条约”，实现日本的中立化。他说，只有走这条路，日本才能摆脱从属于美国的屈辱状态。他说，这是日本民族的使命。
    宫本显治、铃木市藏、裤田里见、神山茂夫等日共中央领导干部也在大演讲会上分别发表了演讲。他们一致号召日本人民，不要放松对敌人的追击，同时要团结一切爱国民主力量，为争取废除日美“安全条约”而斗争到底。
    宫本在谈到日本走向中立的问题时指出，中立并不是要站在和平、独立同战争、从属的中间，而是要同世界各国人民携起手来，一同为争取和平而展开斗争。
    铃木市藏号召党的积极分子们深入人民群众展开宣传运动，使全体人民彻底认清日美“安全条约”反民族、反和平的本质。
    据新华社讯  东京消息：参加反对修改“警察官职务执行法”东京共同斗争会议的各团体代表在20日举行的会议上决定，今后要以反对日美“安全条约”为基本方针而展开斗争。
    参加会议的有东京地方工会评议会、日中友好协会东京都联合会、日朝协会东京都联合会、东京禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、东京都学生自治会联合会、国民救援会、社会党、共产党以及各区共同斗争会议等二十多个单位的代表。
    会议决定，目前他们要努力加强反对修改“警职法”斗争的力量，以便展开斗争，要求立即停止日美为修改“安全条约”而进行的谈判。
    新华社22日讯  东京消息：日本打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会实行委员会以及恢复日中邦交国民会议两个团体，最近联名发出呼吁信，号召日本各群众团体和各界人民积极参加反对修改日美“安全条约”、要求废除日美“安全条约”和打开日中关系的国民运动。
    这两个团体根据在9日举行的联席会议上通过的运动方针，写出了这封呼吁信。呼吁信详细阐明了反对修改日美“安全条约”、要求废除日美“安全条约”和打开日中关系国民联合斗争的目标和计划。
    呼吁信共四百多份，分别发给了日本工会总评议会，各行业工会，日本和平委员会，日中友好协会，青年、妇女、学生、宗教团体，各团体领袖以及各界著名人士。
