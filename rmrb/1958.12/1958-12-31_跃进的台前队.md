The Leaping Forward Taiqian Team

What is this place? People are so happy, people are so busy with production and construction! Look, more than a hundred red-tiled houses have been built in the village. The day before yesterday, the students were still attending classes in old, flat-topped earthen houses, and today they have moved into new classrooms. According to Jiang Guoshan, a cadre here, "This winter and next spring, more than two thousand new houses will be built here, including new villages for residential areas, industry, and cultural and welfare areas." In the fields, green wheat fields are like carpets, crisscrossed by canals, and more than four hundred water wells extend into the earth. The wheat has just been top-dressed with fertilizer, and the canals are already seeing gurgling water... Is this Guanzhong? No, it is located on the north bank of the Yellow River, it is the Taiqian Brigade of the Taiqian Township Commune in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, the place that Comrade Liu Shaoqi inspected in July this year.

This used to be a "dead silt head," but now it has become a high-yield area for food crops. Xiao Daoli, the party branch secretary, said that this is the crystallization of the commune members' hard work during the winter and spring. Since last winter, this brigade has organized more than three thousand laborers, giving the three thousand mu of spring land a major transformation, deep plowing from three to five feet, turning the "dead silt head" into fertile soil. In water conservancy construction, twelve reservoirs and twelve machine wells were completed, one hundred deep springs were sunk, and twenty-four ditches were dug. Coupled with the original water conservancy construction, wells, pits, and rivers are connected, realizing water conservancy.

In these days, the land is filled with people during the day, and there are red flags everywhere, and people are busy with winter production.

    跃进的台前队
    这是什么地方？人们这样喜悦，人们这样忙于生产和建设！看，村庄里已经兴建了一百多间红色瓦房。前天，学生们还在古老的平顶土房里上课，今天就迁进了新的课堂。据这里的干部姜国山说：“今冬明春这里要兴建二千多间新房，包括居民点、工业、文化、福利区的新村庄。”在田野里，一片片碧绿的麦田像地毯一样，渠道纵横交错，四百多眼水井伸入大地。这里刚刚给小麦追上了肥，那里的渠道又看到了潺潺的流水……。这是关中吗？不，它座落在黄河北岸，它是山东寿张县台前乡公社台前大队，是刘少奇同志今年7月间视察过的地方。
    这里过去是一片“死淤头”，现今变成了粮食作物的高产之乡。党支部书记萧道立说，这是社员们大干一冬一春的结晶。去冬以来，这个大队组织了三千多名劳动大军，使三千亩春地来了个大翻身，深翻了三尺到五尺，使“死淤头”变成了蒙金土。在水利建设上，完成了十二座水库，十二眼机井，下了一百眼深泉，挖了二十四条沟渠，加上原来的水利建设，达到了井、坑、河水相连，实现了水利化。
    在这些日子里，白天遍地是人群，到处有红旗，人们正在忙着冬季生产。
