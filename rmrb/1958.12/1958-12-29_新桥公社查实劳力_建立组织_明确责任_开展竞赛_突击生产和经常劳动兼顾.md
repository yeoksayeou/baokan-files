Xinqiao Commune Verifies Labor Force, Establishes Organization, Clarifies Responsibilities, Launches Competition

Balances Crash Production and Regular Labor

(Our report) Xinqiao People’s Commune in Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province, has rectified its labor organization by combining the methods of "verification, organization, determination, competition" with communist ideological education, so as to coordinate the intensive collaborative production with the normal production order.

This commune, with more than 58,000 laborers, has leveraged the advantages of large-scale collaborative production and established various industrial productions in accordance with local conditions. Large-scale collaborative production has also shown its superiority in agriculture. This year, the entire commune's late rice production increased fourfold compared to last year. Although many laborers were transferred to engage in steel and coal production, the autumn harvest was still timely.

However, due to the short period since the establishment of the commune, there was not enough time to establish labor organizations and labor management systems adapted to various productions. There was only large-scale collaborative production but no normal production responsibility system, which led to the phenomena of labor force idling, waste, and neglecting some tasks for others. Production areas were often disrupted in their labor arrangements due to the transfer of labor. The Daoyue Production Area, for example, had its labor force transferred for collaboration, and its 50 mu of winter wheat had not been watered or fertilized for more than half a month after planting. Of the entire commune's five to six hundred mu of cattails (a major local specialty), nearly 100,000 yuan was lost due to untimely harvesting caused by the transfer of more than 2,500 laborers to coal mining. There was also confusion in the transfer of labor for collaboration. The commune often transferred labor from the production teams without the production areas knowing. The commune also did not have a clear understanding of the labor force situation in each production area, and sometimes the requested transfer quantity was more than the actual available labor.

In the process of rectifying and consolidating the commune, Xinqiao Commune identified this chaotic phenomenon in labor organization and comprehensively rectified labor organization, focusing on the Daoyue Production Area. The specific approach was to conduct "verification, organization, determination, competition" for the labor force on a production team basis. Verification meant accurately calculating the number of laborers actually available in each production area, excluding those permanently engaged in industry, and dividing them into full labor, semi-labor, and ancillary labor. Then, based on each person's labor capacity and technical expertise, various specialized teams were formed. On this basis, they were further classified into fixed labor and mobile labor. Fixed labor was generally not transferred except for emergencies such as flood prevention and rescue. Mobile labor was specifically prepared for collaborative support, but still engaged in labor in specialized teams during normal times. In this way, the regular production order would not be disrupted by intensive collaboration, and the commune could also have a grasp of a batch of mobile labor, knowing the number of laborers available for transfer. After the specialized teams were organized, the production area then allocated responsibility areas based on the size of the labor force in each production team, implementing the "four determinations" (determining the plot of land, determining the labor, determining the task, determining the time). For example, Daoyue Production Area plans to sow 1,650 mu of double-cropping rice next year, and all these lands must be deep-plowed (only more than 500 mu have been deep-plowed). According to the results of the verification and organization of the labor force of the seven production teams in the entire production area, there are a total of 554 laborers arranged in the agricultural team, with an average of more than two mu of land to be deep-plowed per laborer. Therefore, the agricultural specialized team of 61 people in the First Production Team was assigned a responsibility area of 125 mu of land. After the specialized teams of each production team determined their responsibilities, they then organized a competition and evaluation campaign for deep plowing and soil improvement. Xinqiao Commune also decided that in the future, the organization of collaborative support by transferring labor must go through certain approval procedures to avoid confusion in labor allocation.

In the process of rectifying labor organization, Xinqiao Commune paid attention to conducting a communist ideological education for cadres and the masses. The commune found that some production team leaders had the erroneous practice of localism when verifying the labor force, such as not including the number of cadres in the calculation, or calculating the full labor force as semi-labor force, attempting to reduce production tasks. Some commune members, when arranging the labor force, requested to be arranged in light work and were unwilling to be arranged in heavy work; those arranged in heavy work hoped to be mobile labor, and other unreasonable demands. In addition to educating cadres and the masses positively, explaining the significance and necessity of rectifying labor organization, the commune also submitted the labor organization plan and specific arrangements to the masses for full discussion, and conducted criticism and self-criticism through discussion to raise the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses.

After the labor organization was rectified and arranged, the efficiency of deep plowing and soil improvement in Daoyue Production Area increased rapidly. Before the rectification of labor organization, the average deep plowing area per person per day was only four li; on the 15th, the first day after the rectification of labor organization, the average deep plowing area per person increased to three fen. The seven production teams in the production area enthusiastically engaged in the competition and evaluation of deep plowing. The commune members of each specialized team are responsible for their own responsibility area, urging each other, comparing their enthusiasm, and the phenomenon of idling and loafing disappeared. The Fourth Production Team, which originally had the lowest labor efficiency, had very high production enthusiasm among its members, and strived to be at the forefront of the entire production area. This team had seven female commune members, and before the start of work at noon on the 15th, they agreed to first go to the field to check and prepare production tools, and each of them was full of energy when working.

    新桥公社查实劳力  建立组织  明确责任  开展竞赛
    突击生产和经常劳动兼顾
    本报讯  广东省高要县新桥人民公社用“查、编、定、竞”和共产主义思想教育相结合的办法，整顿劳动组织，使突击的协作生产和正常的生产秩序协调进行。
    这个有五万八千多个劳动力的公社，建社后发挥了大协作生产的优越性，因地制宜地办起了多种多样的工业生产。大协作生产也在农业上显示出优越性，今年全公社晚稻比去年增加四倍；虽然抽调了很多劳动力去搞钢铁和煤炭生产，秋收也依旧不误农时。
    但是，由于公社成立不久，还来不及建立和各项生产相适应的劳动组织、劳动管理制度，只有大兵团的协作，却没有正常的生产责任制，便出现了劳动力窝工浪费和顾此失彼的现象。各生产区常常因为劳动力被抽调，打乱了劳力安排计划，道悦生产区曾经被抽调劳动力去搞协作，自己的五十亩冬小麦种下后，半个多月竟没有浇过水，施过肥。全公社有五、六百亩蒲草（是这里大宗的土特产），前段因抽调了二千五百多劳动力挖煤以致收割不及时而枯萎，损失将近十万元。在抽调劳动力搞协作时，也出现混乱现象。公社往往从生产队里把劳动力抽走了，生产区还不知道。公社对各生产区的劳动力情况也不摸底，有时要求抽调的数量比实有的还多。
    在整顿巩固公社工作中，新桥公社检查出劳动组织上这种混乱现象，即以道悦生产区为重点，全面整顿劳动组织。具体的做法是以生产队为单位，对劳动力进行“查、编、定、竞”。查就是除固定搞工业的劳力以外，查算清楚每个生产面实有的劳动人数，并区分为全劳动、半劳动和附带劳动。然后，根据各人的劳动能力和技术专长，编成各种专业队。在这个基础上，再分别确定为固定劳动力和机动劳动力两种。固定劳动力除突击事件如防洪抢险等之外，一般是不抽调的；机动劳动力是专为搞协作支援而准备的，但平时仍在专业队从事劳动。这样，就不致因搞突击性的协作，打乱了经常性的生产秩序，公社也可以掌握到一批机动劳动力，抽调时心中有数。编好了专业队之后，生产区随即按各生产队劳动力的多寡，划给责任地区，实行“四定”（定地段、定劳动、定任务、定时间）。如道悦生产区明年计划播种双季稻一千六百五十亩，这些土地要全部实行深翻（已完成深翻的只有五百多亩）。根据全生产区七个生产队查、编劳动力的结果，安排在农业队的劳动力共有五百五十四人，平均每个劳动力要负担深翻两亩多地的任务。于是，第一生产队的农业专业队六十一人便分配到一百二十五亩土地的责任区。各生产队的专业队在确定了自己的责任之后，接着便组织深翻改土的竞赛评比运动。新桥公社还决定今后抽调劳动力组织协作支援，要经过一定的批准手续，避免劳动力调配发生混乱现象。
    在整顿劳动组织的过程中，新桥公社注意到对干部和群众进行一次共产主义思想教育。公社发现一些生产队长在查算劳动力时，有不把干部人数计算在内，或将全劳动力作半劳动力算，企图减轻生产任务的本位主义的错误作法。有的社员在安排劳动力时则要求安排到轻活，不愿安排到重活；安排到重活的希望作机动劳动力等等不合理的要求。公社除了正面教育干部和群众，说明整顿劳动组织的意义和必要性之外，还把劳动组织的方案和具体安排办法都交给群众充分讨论，通过讨论开展批评和自我批评，提高干部和群众的思想觉悟。
    劳动组织经过整顿安排以后，道悦生产区深翻改土的效率迅速提高。这个生产区未整顿劳动组织前，平均每人每天深翻面积只有四厘；15日，整顿劳动组织后的第一天，平均每人深翻土地便提高到三分。生产区的七个生产队热烈地投入深翻的竞赛评比。各专业队的社员在自己的责任区内，人人有责，互相督促，互比干劲，窝工怠工的现象没有了。原来劳动效率最低的第四生产队，社员们生产积极性很高，争得了全生产区的上游。这个队有七名女社员，15日中午开工的时间还未到，便相约定先到地里检查准备生产工具，劳动时个个生龙活虎。  （黎作骥）
