	Blessed with a Long Skating Season
	Ice Sports are Exceptionally Active in Harbin

	(Our dispatch) As winter arrives, Harbin's skating season begins. As soon as December arrives, public sports grounds, the playgrounds of large, medium, and small schools, and the stadiums of large factories almost entirely transform into skating rinks. After 4:30 PM, ticket booths at public skating rinks become crowded with skating enthusiasts carrying their skates, including students, cadres, soldiers, and workers just off their shifts at machine tools and blast furnaces. Inside the skating rink, melodious music plays, and people skate back and forth like shuttles, their ice blades gleaming. Those practicing speed skating often like to form a vertical line, chasing each other in a tense yet relaxed manner. Figure skating enthusiasts, however, leap and draw intricate patterns on the ice, as if practicing dance.

	Located at 45 and a half degrees north latitude, Harbin usually begins to freeze in late October, and the ice and snow do not start to melt until early March of the following year. Therefore, in winter, no sport is more attractive than skating. This year, the cold winter arrived relatively late, and ice sports only began in early December. However, currently, 80,000 people practice skating in the city every day. All school physical education classes have become ice sports coaching courses. This year, all students in Harbin's colleges and universities have learned to skate. 95% of middle school students can go to the ice rink. On average, 50% of elementary school students participate in ice sports. In secondary schools, one can often see neatly arranged students on ice-free playgrounds, bending over, with their hands behind their backs, alternately extending their left and right feet outward according to the teacher's commands, practicing the basic movements of speed skating. In alleys where vehicles are not allowed and on quiet streets, children play ice hockey with sticks they have made themselves.

	This year, Harbin's major factories are preparing to use ice sports as the main project for winter physical exercise. Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Harbin Bearing Factory, and Harbin Flax Factory have all proposed that young workers should learn to skate this year. Among the dozens of ice hockey teams in the city, the Rolling Stock Factory has six ice hockey teams; moreover, several team members are members of Harbin's second ice hockey team. Most of the Rolling Stock Factory's ice hockey team members are outstanding production workers and also include leading cadres. This year, skating is developing from urban areas to rural areas. Zhaodong Town in the city-administered Zhaodong County has thirty ice rinks, and every township has a skating rink. The reservoir built by farmers in Bin County is now a natural skating rink for farmers.

	In the urban area of Harbin, this year, to enable more residents to participate in ice sports, skating rinks are open for free during the day. Middle school ice rinks are generally open to skating enthusiasts from outside the school. Each district in the city has amateur ice sports training classes, and more than 500 people participate in the city-wide amateur ice sports training classes. (Ma Xinren)

    得天独厚滑冰季节长  
    哈尔滨冰上运动异常活跃
    本报讯  随着冬天的到来，哈尔滨的滑冰运动季节开始了。一进入12月，公共运动场，大、中、小学的操场，大工厂的体育场，几乎全部变成了溜冰场。四点半钟以后，公共滑冰场的售票口就挤满了背着冰鞋的滑冰爱好者，有学生、干部、士兵，也有刚从机床和高炉旁下班的工人。滑冰场里面响起了悠扬的音乐，人们在冰上穿梭般地滑行，冰刀闪闪发光。练习速度滑冰的人，常喜欢排成一列纵队，紧张却又非常悠闲地相互追逐。花样滑冰的爱好者，却像练习舞蹈似的，在冰面上跳跃，画复杂的图形。
    位于北纬四十五度半的哈尔滨市，通常在10月下旬就开始结冰，直到来年3月初冰雪才开始溶化。因此，在冬天没有一项运动比滑冰更吸引人了。今年寒冬到来的较迟，到12月初才开始冰上运动。但是，目前单是在市区每天就有八万人练习滑冰。所有学校的体育课都变成了冰上运动的教练课。今年所有在哈尔滨的大专学校，全部学生都学会了滑冰。95％的中学生都能上冰场。参加冰上运动的小学生，平均占总数的50％。在中等学校，经常可以看到排列整齐的学生在没有冰的操场上，弯着腰，背着手，听教师的口令交替地向外伸出左右脚，这是在做速度滑冰的基本练习。在不通行车辆的小巷里和僻静的街上，孩子们用自己做的球杆打冰球。
    今年哈尔滨各大工厂都准备以冰上运动做为冬季体育锻炼的主要项目。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂、哈尔滨轴承厂、哈尔滨亚麻厂都提出了今年青年工人都要学会滑冰。全市几十个冰球队中，车辆厂就有六个冰球队；而且有几名队员是哈尔滨市冰球第二队的队员。车辆厂的冰球队员大部分是生产优秀的工人，而且有领导干部。滑冰运动今年正由市区向农村发展。市属肇东县的肇东镇就有三十个冰场，而且乡乡都有滑冰场。宾县农民修建的水库，现在是农民的天然滑冰场。
    在哈尔滨市区，今年为了使更多的居民参加冰上运动，滑冰场日间免费开放。中学的冰场一般都对校外滑冰爱好者开放。市区各区都有业余的冰上运动训练班，全市性的业余冰上运动训练班有五百多人参加学习。  （马新仁）（附图片）
