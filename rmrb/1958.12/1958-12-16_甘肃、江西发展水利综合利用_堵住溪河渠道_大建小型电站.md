Gansu and Jiangxi are developing comprehensive water conservancy utilization.
    Damming streams and rivers; extensively building small hydropower stations.
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, December 15th) Gansu's rural areas, with hydropower as the vanguard, have promoted the development of comprehensive water conservancy utilization. Currently, the province has utilized the drop of water diversion canals and reservoirs to build 122 small hydropower stations, with a total power generation of 4,000 kilowatts. More than 200 additional small hydropower stations will soon be put into production.
    Before 1956, Gansu Province only had two rural small hydropower stations. In the past two years, while accelerating the construction of modern large-scale power stations, the province has adopted the method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," paying attention to the integration of water conservancy projects with power generation during the construction of 5,000 water diversion canals. Tianshui City and Tianshui County have built 25 rural small hydropower stations, with the largest power generation capacity reaching 30 kilowatts; another 11 small hydropower stations will be completed by the end of the year.
    In accordance with the construction of local small steel bases and in order to accelerate the realization of communal industrialization, agricultural factoryization, and garden-style cultivation, the Provincial Party Committee recently made new deployments for the development of hydropower. During the current winter and spring water conservancy upsurge, a mass movement for power generation will be launched throughout the region. The Zhangye Special District, which is vigorously developing a ten-thousand-reservoir movement, will build 392 hydropower stations in conjunction with reservoir construction. The water diversion project from the Tao River, comparable to the Grand Canal, will become a major channel for comprehensive development and utilization of power generation, irrigation, navigation, forestry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    Due to the rapid development of hydropower in rural areas, many oil presses, flour mills, gunpowder factories, farm tool factories, and ball bearing factories have also begun to be established in many remote mountainous areas. Their production efficiency is dozens of times higher than the original manual operations and water mill drives. After the establishment of a hydropower station in the Wu Dongliang Canal, a banner for water diversion up the mountains nationwide, not only were electric lights and running water installed, and a broadcasting station established, but also an electric cable car from the hot springs at the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain was built, solving the problem of mountain transportation.

    (Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch, December 15th) A massive mass movement to build hydropower stations is unfolding in the rural areas of Jiangxi Province. After more than two months of hard work, 101 water, fire, and biogas power stations have shone brightly across the province, and more small power stations are under construction.
    Jiangxi Province is extremely rich in water resources. The Gan River runs vertically through the province, and its tributaries are distributed like veins on leaves. The province is full of undulating mountains, and rivers wind around them. Therefore, all regions have generally established small hydropower stations and hydraulic stations on a large scale by utilizing mountain streams, rivers, and canals in accordance with the principle of comprehensive utilization of water conservancy projects.
    In October, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee put forward the general policy of mass power generation of "small-scale as the main focus, production as the main focus, commune-run as the main focus," and "using local materials, making use of existing conditions, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and prioritizing indigenous methods over foreign methods," and analyzed the province's favorable conditions: First, most areas of the province are old revolutionary base areas, the broad masses have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and this year's bumper harvest of grain has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses; second, all parts of the province have factories and enterprises such as power plants, processing plants, machine repair plants, and post and telecommunications, which can carry out communist-style large-scale collaboration, comprehensive cooperation, and mutual exchange under the unified leadership of the Party Committee. Subsequently, a mass upsurge in power generation quickly swept across the province. The Qiantian People's Commune in Suichuan County built an 18-kilowatt, 25-horsepower hydropower station. From the factory building to the tailrace pipe, except for a few iron parts, it was all made of brick and wood. Without a hoist gate, commune members used wood to open and close it; without iron wire trash racks, they used bamboo instead; without a generator, they converted a DC motor into a generator. Screws and iron plates were processed from scrap iron, and pulley wheels were replaced with ramie, jute skin, cowhide, etc. In this way, the county had built 106 small all-purpose hydraulic stations in a short period of time, including 16 power stations. The hydraulic stations that have been built all use the flow of water from canals or channels as power. The main equipment of the hydraulic station is a water turbine, casing, and engine room, as well as rice hulling, rice milling, slicing, flour milling, camphor oil, and other processing tools. According to a survey of the hydraulic stations that have already been put into production throughout the county, each hydraulic station processes about the equivalent of 100 to 130 people's workload of grain and oil each day, while each hydraulic station only requires two or three people to manage. The result of mechanized processing will enable the county to save more than 70,000 laborers and invest them in industrial and agricultural production.
    In the mass power generation effort, southern Jiangxi, Shangrao, and other places successfully trial-produced generators and water turbines using indigenous methods; many places also created wooden switchboards and replaced silicon steel sheets with thin iron plates. After the power station is built, transmission lines need to be erected. The Wan'an County Hydropower Engineering Team successfully trial-produced high-voltage transmission porcelain bottles and curved-foot porcelain bottles. (Attached image)

    甘肃、江西发展水利综合利用
    堵住溪河渠道  大建小型电站
    本报兰州15日电  甘肃农村以水电为先行，促进了水利综合利用的发展。现在，全省利用引水上山渠道的跌差和水库，已办起小型水电站一百二十二座，发电总量达四千瓩，另有两百多座小型水电站不久即将投入生产。
    1956年以前，甘肃省仅有两座农村小型水电站。最近两年，全省在加快现代化大型电站建设的同时，采取“土洋结合”的办法，在兴修五千条引水上山渠道的过程中，注意了水利工程与发电相结合。天水市和天水县已建成农村小型水电站二十五座，最大的发电能力达到三十瓩；年底还将有十一座小型水电站落成。
    根据各地小型钢铁基地的建设和为了加速公社工业化、农业工厂化、耕作园田化的实现，省委最近已对发展水电事业作了新的部署，各地在今冬明春的水利高潮中，将掀起一个全民办电运动。正在大闹万库运动的张掖专区，将结合修水库建水电站三百九十二座。可与运河比美的引洮上山工程，将成为发电、灌溉、航运和林、副、渔综合开发利用的大渠道。
    由于水电在农村的迅速发展，在许多深山僻野也开始兴办许多榨油厂、面粉厂、火药厂、农具厂和滚珠轴承厂。它们的生产效率比原有的手工操作和水磨带动提高几十倍。全国引水上山的一面旗帜——武山东梁渠兴修水电站后，不但安装了电灯、自来水，建立了广播站，还从山脚下的温泉修了一条到山顶的电动飞车，解决了山区运输问题。
    本报南昌15日电  一个声势浩大的群众办水电站的运动，正在江西省的农村中展开。经过两个多月的奋战，全省已有一百零一座水、火、沼气电站大放光芒，更多的小型电站正在兴建。
    江西省水利资源极为丰富，赣江纵横全省，支流分布宛如树叶上的叶脉一样。全省群山起伏，河流绕山而下。因此，各地都普遍根据水利工程综合利用的方针，利用山溪、山河、渠道等大量地建立小型电站和水力站。
    中共江西省委在10月间就提出“小型为主，生产为主，社办为主”、“就地取材，因陋就简，土洋结合，先土后洋”的全民办电方针，并分析了本省的有利条件：一、全省大部分地区是革命老根据地，广大群众有着光荣的革命传统，加之今年粮食大丰产，大大的鼓舞了群众的干劲；二、全省各地都有电厂、加工厂、机修厂、邮电等工厂企业，在党委统一领导下，可以大搞共产主义大协作，全面配合、互通有无。接着在全省范围内便迅速掀起了一个全民办电的热潮。遂川县的千田人民公社建成的一座十八瓩、二十五马力的水电站，从厂房到尾水管除了少数铁件外，都是采用砖、木结构。没有启闭机，社员就用木头来启闭；没有铁丝拦污栅就用毛竹代替；没有发电机，就用直流电动机改装成发电机。螺丝铁板用废铁加工，皮带轮用黄麻、苎麻皮、牛皮等代替。就这样，这个县在短短的时间里面，已经建成了小型万能水力站一百零六座，其中有十六座电站。兴建起来的水力站，都是利用水圳或渠道上的流水作动力。水力站的主要设备是水轮机、机壳和机房，还有砻谷、碾米、刨丝、磨粉、樟油等加工工具，根据全县已经投入生产的水力站的调查，每座水力站每天加工的粮食和油料约等于一百到一百三十人的工作量，而每座水力站则只需要两三人管理。加工动力化的结果，将使该县可以节省七万多个劳动力，投入工农业生产。
    在全民办电中，赣南、上饶等地用土法试制成功了发电机和水轮机；许多地方还创造了木制配电盘，并以薄铁板代替矽钢片。电站建成后，要架设输电网。万安县水电工程队试制成功了高压输电瓷瓶及弯脚瓷瓶。（附图片）
