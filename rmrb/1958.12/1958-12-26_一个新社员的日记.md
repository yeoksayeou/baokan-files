A New Commune Member's Diary
Liu Pinjing, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Ganxian County Committee

November 7th, Friday

The County Party Committee Standing Committee held a meeting on the evening of the anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and unanimously passed three resolutions. The second resolution was to decide that all cadres would take turns going to the countryside to be peasants – to be "five-good commune members" (good in ideology, work, labor, study, and unity with commune members). This is a concrete measure to train cadres and a major improvement in leadership methods.

I was approved to be in the first batch to go and be a peasant. I was originally from a peasant background, but after eight years of being an office cadre, I am inevitably a bit rusty going back to being a peasant, especially to participate in the people's commune where the peasants' consciousness has greatly improved, and to be a "five-good" commune member is not that easy.

"Nothing is difficult to a willing mind." First, liberate the "mind." A peasant going back to being a peasant is reliving the old days, but under the education and cultivation of the Party, I guarantee to put down the airs of a cadre and follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Appear among the masses as an ordinary laborer..." I will definitely return to the county as a "five-good" commune member in one to three months. The more I thought about it, the more excited I became. Although it was almost dawn, I was too happy to sleep.

November 8th, Saturday

After breakfast, Xiao Tan and Xiao Liu came to help me pack. After checking my luggage, I put on an apron, slung my backpack, and put on a bamboo hat. As soon as I walked out of the door, Xiao Tan smiled and said that Deputy Secretary Liu really dressed like a peasant.

In the morning, I arrived at the Red Flag Commune and was introduced to the Zhukeng Team in the Fifteenth Work Area. This is my home, the communist labor university. Before dinner, the storekeeper Yan Xingjin (the team leader had gone up the mountain) blew the whistle and announced: "We have a new commune member, Secretary Liu!" Immediately, thunderous applause resounded throughout the canteen to welcome me. At that time, I was very excited and speechless... Finally, I expressed to everyone: "I will learn from everyone, guarantee to obey the leadership and listen to orders, not be afraid of hardship, and be sure to be a 'five-good' commune member." After dinner, I also went with everyone to work the night shift, carrying firewood to refine iron.

November 9th, Sunday

Very early in the morning, the commune members got up again to rush to plant rapeseed. I got up and saw that everyone had gone to the fields. I hurried to the fields, and everyone had just started making ridges and breaking up the soil. Fortunately, I ran fast, otherwise I would have been a backward commune member on the very first morning. As soon as I went down to the field to break up the soil, Uncle Yan Wenbin kept looking at me, seemingly worried that I was not doing it up to standard. After half an hour, what I did was comparable to a medium laborer in terms of both quantity and quality, which put him at ease.

During dinner, I talked to Uncle Yan Wenbin about the technical measures for rapeseed. I said that their plum blossom planting was too sparse and that they should plant in horizontal and vertical rows, increasing four plants in every five clusters. Uncle agreed with my suggestion. He also said that in order to solve the drought and ensure timely sowing of rapeseed, they should adopt the method of raising rapeseed seedlings for transplanting. Uncle told me that it was not good to raise seedlings in paddy fields because the fine soil would not stick to the roots when transplanting seedlings, resulting in a low survival rate, and that peanut fields would be better. This is indeed the experience of an old farmer. I immediately called the County Party Committee Central Office to promote it throughout the county.

November 10th, Monday

These days, the commune members have been very enthusiastic in taking care of me, which has further encouraged my confidence in being a "five-good" commune member. However, everyone is paying close attention to my every move. I wanted to help the kitchen wash the dishes and cabinets, and carry water to cook, but they wouldn't let me do it. Indeed, my spirit of consciously laboring in seeing and doing things has moved them. The current problem is how to motivate all the commune members to consciously labor. Of course, this is not impossible. I am determined to motivate them to become a "five-good" commune member-ized team.

From what I have learned, this team has many problems that need to be changed: from no Party members to having Party members; from few League members to having many League members; from passive commune members to active ones; from no farmer correspondents to having farmer correspondents; from not reading newspapers to reading newspapers; from unstable nurseries to consolidated nurseries; from unstable amateur theater troupes to consolidated ones; from sparse rapeseed planting to dense planting; from planting few vegetables to planting many vegetables; from rotating room work to fixed room work; from each household bringing bowls to fixed bowls, etc. In short, there should be a completely new look, transforming from a backward team to an advanced team. After this plan is realized, it will be promoted throughout the county, and a rectification movement centered on being a "five-good" commune member will be carried out throughout the county.

November 11th, Tuesday

I asked the team for a day off to return to the county to attend an emergency meeting of the County Party Committee. The meeting focused on discussing the rush to winter planting and the comprehensive launch of the communist education movement. At the meeting, I talked about the relationship between communist education and being a "five-good" commune member. I originally wanted to rush back to the team in the evening, but the meeting was postponed and I was very anxious, afraid of delaying my holiday.

November 13th, Thursday

Uncle Wenbin is simply a "person who never rests." He gets up early in the morning to go to the fields to watch the production, and then goes to water the vegetables. After everyone rests after eating, he goes to pick up manure. He always does a lot of odd jobs before and after meals.

I want to say that if everyone could be so diligent, do things when they see them, and consciously labor without complaint, the commune's production would be better than it is now. By evaluating labor attitude, we can set off a climax of communist education, and it is not impossible for all the people in the county to establish conscious labor.

November 14th, Friday

Aunt Liu Fengzai has been deeply influenced by the old society and still has a head full of selfish and self-interested thoughts. She always gets off work early and goes to work late, taking the time to engage in her private small income, catching frogs and bugs to feed her chicks. Sometimes, regardless of the interests of the commune, she puts the chicks in the rapeseed fields or vegetable seedling soil... Everyone hates her and satirizes her, and she doesn't care. People need to be educated, and old habits can be changed. We will pay attention to educating her in the future.

November 16th, Sunday

The cold wind was bone-chilling in the morning, but it was warmer than yesterday. I was assigned to water the fields with Zhu Yapo and Ye Jinglan in the same waterwheel. Although Yapo couldn't speak, she always wanted to reflect the situation to me and chat about family matters. She shook her thumb, and I didn't understand what she meant. Ye Jinglan told me that she wanted to be a model. She made many gestures, some asking me how many brothers I had, some reflecting who was diligent and excellent, and which commune members were selfish and self-interested. Ye Jinglan translated them to me one by one.

As long as you can truly integrate with the masses, even a mute can reflect the situation. (Attached picture)

    一个新社员的日记
    中共赣县县委副书记  刘品经
    11月7日  星期五
    县委常委会在十月社会主义革命纪念日晚上开会，一致通过三个决定，其中第二个决定是决定全体干部轮流到农村去当农民——做“五好社员（思想、工作、劳动、学习、团结社员），这是锻炼干部的一个具体措施，是领导方法上的一项重大改进。
    我被批准第一批去当农民，我本来就是农民出身，八年来由于做了机关干部，重新去当农民不免有些生疏，特别是去参加农民觉悟大大提高了的人民公社，而且还要做好“五好”社员，也不是这么容易的。
      “事怕有心人”，首先把“心”解放出来，农民再去当农民，旧事重办，在党的教育培养下，我保证放下干部架子，按毛主席指示：“以一个普通的劳动者出现在群众中……”。我一定在一至三个月中当个“五好”社员回县。我越想越起劲，虽然已经快要天亮了，我高兴得不想睡觉。
    11月8日  星期六
    早饭后，小谭小刘都来了，帮我收拾东西，检好行李后，我围上围裙，打起背包，戴上斗笠，刚走出房门，小谭笑着说，刘副书记确实打扮得像个农民样子。
    上午到了红旗公社，介绍我到十五工区珠坑队，这里就是我的家，是共产主义的劳动大学。晚饭开膳前，保管员严性近
  （队长上山了）吹哨子宣布说：我们增加了一名社员是刘书记，顿时全食堂响起了雷震般的掌声欢迎我，当时我内心很激动，说不出话，……最后我向大家表示说：向大家学习，保证服从领导听指挥，不怕艰苦，一定要做个“五好”社员，晚饭后我也同大家去打夜班挑柴炼铁。
    11月9日  星期日
    大清早社员们又起床去抢种油菜。我起床一看，大家都下了田。我赶紧跑到田里，大家正好才开始做畦碎土。幸亏跑得快，不然第一早晨就是落后社员。我一下田动手碎土，严文滨大伯就不时的看我，看样子他是怕我做得不合规格，半小时后，我所做的能比得上一个中等劳力和中等质量，这才使他放心了。
    在吃饭的时候，我和严文滨大伯谈起油菜的技术措施，我说他们种梅花形太稀了，要种横直行，每五兜中可增加四兜，大伯同意了我的建议，又说到为了解决干旱做到及时播种油菜，采取油菜育秧移栽，大伯告诉我禾稿田不好育秧，移苗时带不上细泥土，成活率低，要用花生田更好。这确实是老农经验，我便马上电话告诉县委中心办公室，推广全县。
    11月10日  星期一
    这几天社员对我非常热情的照顾，更加鼓舞了我做个“五好”社员的信心。但是我的一举一动大家都很注意，我要帮厨房洗碗橱、挑水煮饭，他们都不让我去做，的确我这见事做事自觉劳动的精神感动了他们。现在的问题是如何把所有社员都带动起来，自觉劳动，当然这也不是办不到的事，下决心把他们带动起来成为一个“五好”社员化的小队。
    从所了解的情况来看，这个队有许多问题需要变革的：无党员变有党员；团员少变团员多；消极社员变积极；无农民通讯员变有通讯员；不读报变读报；托儿所由不巩固变巩固；业余剧团不巩固变巩固；油菜稀播变密播；种菜少变种菜多；轮流做房变固定；各户带碗变固定等。总之来个面貌一新，由落后队变成先进队，这个计划实现之后，就推广到全县，在全县范围开展以做个“五好”社员为中心的整社运动。
    11月11日  星期二
    向队里请好一天假，回县参加县委紧急会议，会议着重讨论了突击冬种和全面开展共产主义教育运动。在会上我谈了下共产主义教育与做个“五好”社员的关系。晚上本来想赶回队里去，谁知会议推迟散会，我心里很着急，怕耽误假期。
    11月13日  星期四
    文滨大伯，简直是
  “不休息的人”，早晨起床到田间观看生产，一刻又浇菜去了，吃过饭大家在休息，他又去捡粪了，饭前饭后他总是要做许多零星工夫。
    我想要是大家都能这样见事做事不辞劳苦自觉地劳动，公社的生产就会比现在更好，通过评劳动态度，掀起共产主义教育高潮，全县人民都树立起自觉劳动，是不会办不到的。
    11月14日  星期五
    刘凤仔大娘因为受旧社会的影响太深，到现在还一脑子的自私自利思想。她总是先下班后上班，抽时去搞她私人小收入，捉青蛙、虫子给她的小鸡子吃，有时候不顾社的利益，把小鸡放在油菜田或菜秧土里，……大家都讨厌她，讽刺她，她也不在乎。人是要教育，老习惯也会改变，今后注意对她进行教育。
    11月16日  星期日
    早晨起来寒风刺骨，比起昨天来还是暖和些，我被分工和朱哑婆、叶景兰同一辆车车水，哑婆虽然说不出话，但总想向我反映情况，交谈家常，她摇摇大拇指，我不懂什么意思，叶景兰告诉我说，她要做模范，她做了许多手势，有的是问我有几兄弟，有的是反映那个顶勤恳，顶呱呱，那个社员又自私自利，叶景兰都一件一件翻译给我听。
    只要能真正和群众打成一片，哑子也能反映情况。  （附图片）
