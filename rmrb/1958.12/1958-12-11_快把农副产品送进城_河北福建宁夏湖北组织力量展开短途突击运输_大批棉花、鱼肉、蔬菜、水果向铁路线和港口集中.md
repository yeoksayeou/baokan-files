(Our Tianjin dispatch of the 10th) Hebei Province's commercial departments at all levels are relying on Party committees and mobilizing the masses to launch a mass short-distance transportation blitz movement. This is moving urgently needed agricultural and sideline products like grain, non-staple foods, and industrial raw materials, as well as daily necessities like salt and coal for this year's Spring Festival, to collection points along railway lines for concentrated railway transportation. According to incomplete statistics, as of the 8th, over 100,000 tons of various materials had been collected at stations awaiting shipment.

In order to support the commercial departments' blitz transportation of materials, special organizations for blitz transportation have been established in various places, headed by Party committees, and a number of cadres have been dispatched to key areas for material allocation to help organize transportation work. Many counties have dispatched hundreds of large and small carts, with commune members helping the commercial departments to transport externally allocated materials to railway lines and transportation hubs. In a day or two, commune members in Xinle, Yongnian, and other counties concentrated two to three thousand tons of cotton, live pigs, and vegetables at stations. People's communes along the railway lines also allocated a certain amount of loading and unloading labor to ensure timely unloading and loading of trains after their arrival, solving the difficulty of insufficient loading and unloading capacity of the railway departments.

(Our Fuzhou dispatch of the 10th) Commercial and transportation departments in Fujian Province are carrying out a blitz transport of large quantities of agricultural and sideline products, providing a steady supply to major and medium-sized cities inside and outside the province. Among them, from December 1st to 7th, in seven days, the Yingxia Railway and Nanfu Railway transported more than 20,000 tons of agricultural and sideline products such as tangerines, sugarcane, and rice to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other places for market sales and export. In addition, more than 1,000 tons of non-staple foods such as tangerines, dried lychees, condensed milk, and fruit wine planned to be transferred from Longxi, Minhou, Hua'an, and other places to Nanchang, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Hefei, and other places for market sales, as well as more than 2,000 tons of moso bamboo planned to be transferred from Shaowu, Chong'an, Shaxian, and other places to Shandong, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities to supply industrial and fishery production needs, are also being processed, packaged, and transported by vehicles and ships to railway lines from various production areas and will be fully shipped out around the 11th.

During this blitz transportation, under the unified arrangement and leadership of local Party committees, employees of commercial and transportation departments in various places have given full play to the spirit of communist collaboration, thus enabling a large number of backlog materials to be transferred and transported in a timely manner. In many places, commercial workers, in addition to verifying the number of vehicles needed, have also taken the initiative to assist transportation departments in organizing local civilian transportation forces to concentrate agricultural and sideline products awaiting shipment from scattered locations to water and land transportation main lines, greatly facilitating the connection of automobiles and ships. Transportation department employees also universally carried out rapid loading and unloading and transportation movements, rapidly improving the turnover efficiency of vehicles and ships, ensuring that while completing the transfer tasks of pig iron, timber, and other materials, they could steadily transport agricultural and sideline products scattered in the vast countryside to the cities.

(Our Yinchuan dispatch of the 10th) The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is supporting Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, and other provinces and cities with a total of more than 15,000 meat sheep. All of these sheep will be processed into frozen meat locally and shipped out. So far, 1,500 frozen meat sheep have been transported to Liaoning. The rest are either being shipped or are being concentrated along the railway line, packaged, and awaiting shipment.

In order to enable the people of Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities to eat a large amount of fresh and delicious mutton during the New Year, many Hui old workers in Yinchuan City who are experienced in slaughtering sheep have recently been slaughtering meat sheep in blitzes. They brave the early winter cold at the frozen meat processing plant, and after slaughtering the sheep, they immediately hang them on wooden frames to skin them, and in the process of skinning, they ensure that the meat does not touch the wool, ensuring the quality of the product.

(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 10th) In November, Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, saw a new situation of turning over and over again and leaping again and again in the work of rushing to transport various materials. The amount of materials transported in the county this month reached 226,026 tons, an increase of one time over the amount transported in October and ten times over the amount transported in September.

Faced with the situation of a sharp increase in transportation volume, the county quickly established a unified transportation command, with County Mayor Xiong Yingting as the commander-in-chief and County Party Committee First Secretary Dong Yusen as the political commissar, and mobilized more than 20,000 people to use various folk transportation tools to concentrate various materials to the county seat day and night. At present, about 63,000 tons of grain and cotton have been concentrated in the county, and some of the cotton is being transported to Hankou and other places along with vegetables, meat, fresh fish, and other daily necessities.

The characteristics of Hanchuan County's large-scale blitz transportation are relying on the masses and self-reliance. In order to improve traffic conditions, all communes mobilized the masses to change narrow roads into wide roads, curved roads into straight roads, and steep slopes into gentle slopes, so that the roads between the county seat and all communes were unimpeded. The county has very few modern means of transportation, and the transportation of most materials relies almost entirely on the more than 10,000 manpower carts, animal-drawn carts, and wooden boats that the masses originally had and rushed to make. In order to increase transportation capacity, in addition to organizing all professional and sideline vehicles and ships to participate in transportation, many communes also rushed to make various transportation tools day and night.

    快把农副产品送进城
    河北福建宁夏湖北组织力量展开短途突击运输
    大批棉花、鱼肉、蔬菜、水果向铁路线和港口集中
    本报天津10日电  河北省各地商业部门依靠党委、发动群众，掀起一个群众性的短途运输突击运动，把当前急待运输的粮食、副食品、工业原料等农副产品和食盐、煤炭等今年春节的日用百货运至铁路沿线各集运点，供铁路部门突击运输。据不完全统计，截至8日，各地集运到车站待运的各种物资达十万多吨。
    为了支援商业部门突击调运物资，各地分别成立了突击运输的专门机构，由党委挂帅，并抽调出一部分干部，分赴物资调运重点地区，帮助组织调运工作。许多县抽出数百辆大车小车，由公社社员帮助商业部门把外调物资运到铁道沿线和交通要道。新乐、永年等县的公社社员在一两天的时间里，就分别把两三千吨的棉花、生猪、蔬菜等集中到车站。铁道沿线的各人民公社还调配了一定的装卸劳力保证火车到后能够及时卸货、装车，解决铁路部门装卸力的不足的困难。
    本报福州10日电  福建省各地商业、交通运输部门突击调运大批农业、副业产品，源源供应省内外各大、中城市的需要。其中从12月1日到7日七天中，由鹰厦铁路、南福铁路运往上海、广州、厦门、福州等地供应市销和外销的柑桔、果蔗、大米等农、副业产品共达两万多吨。此外，计划由龙溪、闽侯、华安等地调往南昌、杭州、上海、镇江、南京、合肥等地市销的一千多吨柑桔、荔枝干、炼乳、果木酒等副食品，以及由邵武、崇安、沙县等地调往山东、上海等省市，供应工业、渔业生产需要的两千多吨毛竹，也正由各个产地加紧进行加工、包装和用车、船陆续运到铁路沿线，在11日前后就可全部运出。
    在这次突击调运中，各地商业、交通运输部门职工，在当地党委统一安排和领导下，都充分发挥了共产主义的协作精神，因而使大批积压的物资都能及时的调运出来。许多地方的商业工作人员除了切实核实要车数量外，还主动协助交通运输部门就地组织民间运输力量，把待运的农、副产品化零为整地集中到水、陆运输干线上，大大便利了汽车和船舶接运。运输部门职工也普遍开展了快速装卸和运输运动，迅速提高了车、船周转效率，保证了在完成生铁、木材等调运任务同时，能把分散在广大农村中的农、副产品源源运往城市。
    本报银川10日电  宁夏回族自治区支援北京、上海、辽宁等省市的肉羊共有一万五千多只，这些羊只将全部在当地加工成冻肉运出。到目前已经有一千五百只羊冻肉运到了辽宁。其余有的正在起运，有的正集中铁路沿线，包装待运。
    宁夏地区为了使北京、上海等城市人民在新年吃到大量新鲜肥美的羊肉，银川市的许多富有宰羊经验的回族老工人，最近以来经常突击宰肉羊，他们在冻肉加工场上冒着初冬的严寒，把羊宰后，立即挂在木架上剥皮并在剥皮过程中作到了肉不沾毛，保证了产品的质量。
    新华社武汉10日电  湖北省汉川县11月份在抢运各项物资的工作中出现了翻了又翻、跃了再跃的新局面。这个月全县运输物资的数量达到二十二万六千零二十六吨，比10月份运量提高一倍，比9月份提高十倍。
    面对着运量急剧增加的形势，这个县迅速成立了运输统一指挥部，由县长熊映庭担任总指挥，县委第一书记董玉森担任政治委员，并且发动两万多人运用各种民间运输工具，把各项物资日夜集中到县城。现在，全县约有六万三千吨粮食和棉花已经集中起来，其中有一部分棉花正在随同蔬菜、肉类、鲜鱼等生活日用品运往汉口等地。
    汉川县大搞突击运输的特点是依靠群众，自力更生。为了改善交通条件，各公社都动员群众把窄路改成宽路，弯路改成直路，陡坡改成平坡，使县城跟所有公社的道路畅通无阻。这个县的现代化交通工具很少，绝大部分物资的运输几乎完全依靠群众原有和赶制的一万多部人力车、畜力车和木船来完成的。为了增加运力，许多公社除了组织所有专业和副业车船投入运输以外，还日夜赶制了各种运输工具。
