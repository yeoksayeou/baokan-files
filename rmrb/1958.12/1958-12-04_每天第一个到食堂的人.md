The first person to arrive at the canteen every day

Where is Wang Fengying? Everyone in the kitchen asked with concern. Usually, she's the first one to arrive, and now it's almost dawn... Everyone was talking about her. Just then, her daughter, Liu Conglan, ran in. She said:
  "My mother is sick, and she asked me to come in her place today because she was afraid of delaying everyone. My mother woke me up and urged me to hurry up, so I ran here without even combing my hair."

Wang Fengying is already fifty-four years old, but she works even more enthusiastically than the young people. Ever since the Hongguang Brigade's Fifth Team of the Dongfeng Commune in Zhongning County started the canteen, she has been the first to arrive at the canteen every day to light the fire and boil water. In the evening, she always lets the other cooks with children go home first, and she stays behind to wash the pots, stoves, bowls, chopsticks, and basins until they are clean and tidy. She sweeps the firewood next to the stove into a pile and cleans the cutting board before she feels at ease. She not only loves her job, but also often encourages other young cooks to work hard. Usually, she picks up the rice and flour that the children spill on the ground and promotes the need to conserve food to everyone.

Wang Fengying's decision to do this work came after a certain amount of ideological struggle. At first, she felt that this work was lowly, that it was serving others. But later she figured it out. She said, "In the past, doing this work was serving the landlord, being beaten, scolded, and humiliated, and never even getting to eat a good meal. Now, it's working for everyone, and everyone's work includes my contribution." During the canteen's discussion of not repeating meals for seven days, she once again expressed that she wanted to make the meals even better for everyone, so that everyone could eat more deliciously and sweetly.

### 每天第一个到食堂的人

    每天第一个到食堂的人
    王凤英怎么没有来呀！厨房里大家都很关心地问。平常就数她来得早，现在天快亮了……大家都在叨念她。正在这个时候，她的女儿刘从兰跑来了。她说：
  “我娘病了，今天叫我来替她，怕耽误了大家的事，我娘把我叫醒来，催我赶快来，我连头都没梳就一气跑来了。”
    王凤英今年已是五十四岁的人了，可是干起活来比年轻人还欢，自从中宁县东风公社红光大队第五小队办起食堂后，每天她第一个人来到食堂起火烧水。晚上总是先让别的有娃娃的炊事员先回去，自己留下把锅灶、碗筷、盆洗刷得干干净净，摆放得整整齐齐，把锅旁的柴草扫到一堆，案板上收拾干净才算放心。她不但热爱自己的工作，而且还经常鼓励其他年轻炊事员努力工作。平常孩子们撒在地上的米、面，她就拾起来，并向大家宣传要节约粮食。
    王凤英作这一工作，是经过一定思想斗争的。起初她觉得这个工作下贱，是侍候人的。但后来她想通了。她说：“过去干这活是侍候地主，受打受骂又受气，更没有吃上过一顿好饭好菜。现在是为大家干，大家干活也有我的一份。”这次食堂讨论七天不做重样饭时，她再一次表示要给大家把饭做得更好，让大家吃得更香更甜。
