Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 28th:  After a year of hard work, the Vietnamese people have already exceeded the targets for the first year (1958) of the three-year economic development plan ahead of schedule.

According to preliminary summaries of the lowest estimated figures from various economic departments, grain output this year reached 4.5 million tons, 8% higher than the highest grain output in North Vietnam's history in 1956, and more than 80% higher than the highest grain output during the French colonial rule in 1939. The average yield of rice per hectare is 2.3 tons, setting the highest record in the history of all Vietnam (including South Vietnam). The output of animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry has also far exceeded that of the most prosperous years before World War II.

This year is also the fastest year for industrial development in North Vietnam. The total industrial output value increased by more than 40% compared to last year, exceeding the highest level during French rule. The production of electricity, coal, phosphate fertilizer, and chromite has also increased by 30% to 80% compared to last year.

As the New Year approaches, the working people in various parts of North Vietnam, while celebrating the great victories on the economic and cultural fronts this year, are also enthusiastically discussing how to usher in a greater "leap forward" in production next year, and how to exceed the targets set by the three-year plan, so that in agricultural production, the annual rice output in North Vietnam will break through 7.6 million tons in the next two years. At that time, the average person will receive nearly 600 kilograms of food (including 100 kilograms of miscellaneous grains), which is more than three times the highest level of 1939 before World War II. In terms of industrial production, 96 enterprises of various sizes will be built in North Vietnam within two years.

    越南今年经济计划超额完成  
    农业空前丰收工业增产百分之四十
    新华社河内28日电  越南人民经过一年苦战，已经提前超额完成三年经济发展计划头一年（1958年）的指标。
    根据各经济部门初步总结的最低估计数字，谷物产量今年达到四百五十万吨，比北越历史上谷物产量最高的1956年高出8％，超过法国殖民者统治时期谷物产量最高的1939年达80％以上。稻子每公顷平均产量是二点三吨，成为全越南（包括南越）历史上最高的纪录。畜牧、渔、林业的产量也都远远超过了第二次世界大战前经济最繁荣的年代。
    今年北越工业的发展也是最快的一年。工业总产值比去年增长40％以上，超过了法国统治时期的最高水平。电力、煤矿、磷肥、铬铁矿的生产也都比去年实际增长30％至80％不等。
    在这新年将到的时候，越南北方各地的劳动人民在和庆祝今年经济文化战线上的巨大胜利同时，都在热烈讨论着怎样迎接明年生产更大的“猛进”，怎样超额完成三年计划规定的指标，在农业生产方面使越南北方在今后两年内稻子年产量突破七百六十万吨。那时候按人口平均，每人将得到近六百公斤口粮（包括一百公斤杂粮），等于第二次世界大战前最高水平1939年的三倍多。在工业生产方面，两年内越南北方将建成九十六项大小企业。
