"Efforts should be made to ensure that economic plans are based on a fully reliable foundation, and that various indicators maintain appropriate proportions to each other in accordance with the objective laws of proportionate development of various sectors of the national economy." - "Communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China"

High Speed is Needed, But Also Balance
·Abstract of article from "Liberation" semi-monthly·

The "Liberation" semi-monthly, published on the 16th, carried an article by Cao Diqiu entitled "On Balance and Imbalance." The author, after pointing out that the high-speed development in industry has completely broken through the old concepts and methods of balance, said: The socialist economy is a planned economy and must be planned with balance, otherwise, production will fall into a state of anarchy. However, planned balance must follow the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, and must reflect the enormous potential of socialist productive forces and the internal connections between various economic sectors. Only in this way can it correctly guide production and accelerate the development of socialist production; otherwise, it will be detrimental to accelerating the development of socialist production. Therefore, whether the method of balance is correct plays a significant role in the speed of socialist economic development.

Adopting a High-Speed Balance Method Can Correctly Reflect Objective Laws

The author pointed out: The most important issue in socialist construction is the issue of speed, but there are differences between high speed, medium speed, and low speed. What we need should never be low speed, nor should it be medium speed, but high speed. In the more than nine years since liberation, we have experienced low speed, medium speed, and high speed in the speed of socialist construction, and a saddle-shaped curve has appeared. The indicators achieved in this year's Great Leap Forward are high-speed indicators, and the realization of these indicators is very thought-provoking.

After systematically criticizing some incorrect aspects of the past in the understanding and methods of balance, the author pointed out: Our country needs high-speed development, and we should adopt a balance method that adapts to high-speed development. The method of using advanced to drive the backward is a high-speed development balance method. Because this balance method correctly reflects objective laws, it can create a situation where one horse takes the lead and ten thousand horses gallop, and can promote the continuous leap forward of production. This is a method of seeking balance from unbalanced movement.

High Speed Also Has Limits in a Certain Time and Under Certain Conditions, and Subjective Wishes Cannot Replace Objective Laws

Then, the author systematically criticized the erroneous tendency of completely ignoring balance and proportionate development, and attempting to replace the objective laws of economic development with subjective wishes.

The article said: Because we have adopted the balance method of using the advanced to drive the backward, a leap forward situation has formed on the industrial front. As a result, some economic workers and enterprise leaders have developed illusions; it seems that in our country's economic construction, as long as we use the advanced to drive the backward and organize leap forwards, there is no need for balance. In our country, socialist construction must be carried out at high speed, and high-speed construction will inevitably lead to a leap forward situation, from several small leap forwards to large leap forwards, from partial qualitative changes in the process of quantitative change to fundamental qualitative changes. But is there a balance in the process of quantitative and qualitative change? It must be recognized that although balance is a temporary phenomenon in unbalanced movement, it is also an objective process that does not depend on people's will. If we only rely on subjectivity to deny this process, and do not follow this objective process, and give play to subjective initiative to control this process, it will inevitably cause chaos. Whether natural phenomena or social phenomena are interconnected, they not only have external connections, but also internal connections. The connection between economic sectors in social phenomena is even closer. For example, the various sectors of our national economy are interdependent and intertwined. One sector cannot exist without another. Taking steel as the key link and promoting a comprehensive leap forward shows that the development of steel can drive the development of other industries. Conversely, if other industries do not develop accordingly, the development of steel will also be restricted, or even cannot be developed at all. Because to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry, the machinery industry needs to manufacture a large number of smelting equipment, and to produce steel, iron, coal, electricity, refractory materials, acids, alkalis, and others are needed. Without these, steel cannot be smelted. If steel cannot be smelted, there is no point in talking about the development of steel. Therefore, to make the iron and steel industry develop to a certain level, it is necessary to make the industries closely related to it develop in proportion, and maintain a relative balance between them.

The leap forward in our industry is a concrete manifestation of high-speed development on the industrial front. However, it would be dangerous to deny the balance existing in objective reality simply because we want high-speed development. Since balance is an objective existence, then high-speed development also has high-speed balance. At the same time, high speed also has limits in a certain time and under certain conditions. If this limit is exceeded, contradictions between subjectivity and objectivity will arise. Subjective wishes are good, but objective reality does not permit it. Comrade Mao Zedong once instructed us, "No one can engage in unfounded fantasies, nor can they plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not reluctantly do things that are really impossible." Therefore, if we pursue speed without basis, and do not base high speed on a certain material foundation, then we will inevitably run counter to objective reality and fall into subjectivism. This year, a few enterprise leaders in Shanghai have simply pursued high speed and high targets, and have not considered the various factors related to high targets. As a result, the leap forward targets proposed by some factories have ranged from ten times to dozens of times, and have become impossible to achieve. Because the leap forward of a factory's targets is not entirely determined by the factory itself. The availability of raw materials and the possibility of off-site collaboration also play a role. If these conditions are not possible, then a factory cannot leap forward. The same is true for a national economic sector. The leap forward of its own sector must be based on the corresponding leap forward of related sectors. In some cases, a sector may be able to achieve a temporary leap forward by detaching itself from other sectors, but when the leap forward reaches a certain level, it will be restricted by other conditions and will not be able to leap forward any further. This illustrates the necessity of planned and proportionate development of the national economy.

The Various Sectors of the Socialist Economy are an Organic Whole, and None Can Develop in Isolation

Why do these comrades not want balance? Ideologically, it is because they do not understand the interrelationship of things, which are not only complementary but also mutually restrictive. Ignoring the mutually restrictive aspect will naturally lead to the erroneous understanding of isolated development and not wanting balance. On the other hand, it is also because they do not understand the subjective initiative of people, and will naturally fall into the quagmire of idealism, thereby producing the erroneous understanding of denying objective conditions.

We should see that the various sectors of the socialist economy are an organic whole, with close connections and interdependent relationships, and none can develop in isolation. Therefore, when we adopt the balance method of advanced leading the backward and backward catching up with the advanced, when we grasp the main contradictions, solve the main contradictions, and thereby drive the solution of a series of secondary contradictions, we must at the same time emphasize the collaboration between various economic sectors, and take measures to promote close collaboration between various sectors. Collaboration can generate new productive forces. Things that a sector or a region cannot do alone can be done and done better through the collaboration of several units or several regions.

Our socialist construction undertaking is a national chessboard. From the perspective of the whole country, the whole country is the big picture, and the local is the small picture. The small picture must obey the big picture. From the perspective of a region, the region is a whole, and a unit is a part, and the part must obey the whole. Therefore, collaboration between various economic sectors is necessary for the socialist system, and the division of labor and collaboration are a unity of opposites. The finer the division of labor, the more collaboration is needed. The kind of balance that does not require collaboration and does not require planning will only cause the national economy to regress to a state of anarchy, which is definitely not allowed by the socialist system.

### 要高速度  也要平衡

    需要努力使经济计划建立在充分可靠的基础上，并且根据国民经济各部门按比例发展的客观法则，努力使各项指标相互保持适当的比例。“中国共产党八届六中全会公报”
    要高速度  也要平衡
    ·“解放”半月刊文章摘要·
    16日出版的“解放”半月刊登载了曹荻秋的“论平衡与不平衡”一文。作者在指出由于工业上的高速度发展，完全冲破了旧的平衡观念和平衡方法之后说：社会主义经济是计划经济，必须进行计划的平衡，否则，就将陷生产于无政府状态。但是，计划平衡必须遵循国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则，必须反映社会主义生产力的巨大潜力，反映各经济部门之间的内在联系，它才能正确地指导生产和加速社会主义生产的发展，反之，就将不利于加速社会主义生产的发展。因此，平衡的方法是否正确，对社会主义经济发展的快慢起着重大作用。
    采取高速度平衡的方法才能正确反映客观规律
    作者指出：社会主义建设的最重要的问题是速度问题，但是速度有高速度、中速度、低速度之不同，我们所需要的决不应该是低速度，也不应该是中速度，而应该是高速度。解放九年多以来，我们在进行社会主义建设的速度上是经历过低速度、中速度、高速度，曾经出现过马鞍形，今年大跃进所实现的指标，是一种高速度的指标，这一指标的实现十分发人深省。
    作者比较系统地批判了过去在平衡的认识和方法上存在着一些不正确的地方后指出：我们国家需要高速度发展，就应该采取适应高速度发展的平衡方法。以先进带动落后的方法，是一种高速度发展的平衡方法。因为这种平衡方法正确地反映了客观规律，它可以造成一马当先、万马奔腾的形势，可以促进生产不断跃进，这是一种从不平衡的运动中求得平衡的方法。
    高速度在一定时间和一定条件下也有限度，不能用主观愿望代替客观规律
    接着作者又比较系统地批判了完全不注意平衡、不注意按比例发展，企图用主观愿望代替经济发展的客观规律的错误倾向。
    文章说：由于我们采取了以先进带动落后的平衡方法，形成了工业战线上跃进的局面，由此，也使某些经济工作者、企业的领导人产生了错觉；好似在我国的经济建设中只要以先进带动落后，组织跃进，就不必再要平衡了。在我们国家建设社会主义必需要高速度的进行，要高速度进行建设就必然要出现跃进的形势，从若干小的跃进发展到大的跃进，从量变过程中的部分质变发展到质的根本改变。但是在数量与质量的变化过程中有没有平衡？必须认识平衡虽然是不平衡运动中的暂时现象，但也是不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程，如果只凭主观去否定这个过程，不去顺应这个客观过程，发挥主观能动作用去驾驭这个过程，那就必然造成混乱。不管自然现象和社会现象都是相互连接着，它们不仅有外在联系，而且有内在联系，在社会现象中的经济部门之间的关联更为密切，比如说我国国民经济各部门之间都是相互依存，相互渗透的。一个部门离开别一部门就不能存在，以钢为纲全面跃进，说明钢发展了可以带动其他工业的发展。反过来，其他工业如若不相应的发展，钢的发展也就要受到限制，甚至根本发展不起来。因为要大力发展钢铁工业，就需要机械工业大量制造冶炼设备，要生产钢就需要铁、煤、电，需要耐火材料、酸、碱，以及其他。没有这些，钢就炼不成。钢炼不成，就谈不上钢的发展。因此，要使钢铁工业发展到某个水平，必须使与它有密切关系的工业按比例发展，使它们之间保持相对的平衡。
    我国工业上的跃进，是工业战线上高速度发展的具体表现。可是，如果因为要高速度发展而就否定客观现实中存在着的平衡，那是危险的。平衡既然是客观存在，那末，高速度的发展也有高速度的平衡。同时，高速度在一定时间和一定条件下也有限度，超过了这个限度就要产生主观与客观的矛盾，主观愿望虽好，无奈客观现实不许可。毛泽东同志曾指示我们，
  “任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。”因此，如果无根据地追求速度，不把高速度建立在一定的物质基础上，那就必然与客观现实背道而驰，而陷入主观主义。今年，上海有少数企业的领导干部，单纯追求高速度和高指标，对高指标的各种有关因素却不加考虑，因而有的厂提出的跃进指标从十倍到数十倍，已成为不可能实现的指标。因为一个厂的指标的跃进，不完全决定于一个厂本身，起作用的还有原材料是否供应得上，厂外协作是否可能，如果这些条件都不可能，那一个厂是不可能跃进的。一个国民经济部门也是如此，自己部门的跃进必须建立在有关部门相应的跃进基础上。在某些时候一个部门脱离了其他部门也许可以取得暂时的跃进，但跃进到一定程度，它就会被其他条件所限制而不可能再跃进，这说明国民经济有计划按比例发展的必要性。
    社会主义经济各部门是个有机的整体，谁也不能孤立发展
    这些同志为什么会不要平衡？从思想方法上来说，是由于他们不了解事物的相互关系，不仅是相辅相成的，而且是相互制约的。忽视了相互制约的一面，自然就会产生孤立发展、不要平衡的错误认识。另一方面，也由于他们不了解人的主观能动性，自然就会陷于唯心主义的泥沼，从而产生否定客观条件的错误认识。
    我们应当看到：社会主义经济的各个部门是个有机的整体，有着紧密的联系和相互依存的关系，谁也不能孤立发展。因此，在我们采取先进带落后、落后赶先进的平衡方法时，在抓住主要矛盾、解决主要矛盾，从而带动一系列次要矛盾的解决时，必须同时强调各经济部门间的协作，要采取措施来促成各部门间的紧密协作。协作能够产生新的生产力，一个部门、一个地区单独做不到的事情，几个单位、几个地区的协作就可以办得到而且会办得更好。
    我们社会主义建设事业，是全国一盘棋。从全国说，全国是大局，地方是小局。小局必须服从大局。从地区说，地区是一个整体，一个单位是部分，部分必须服从整体。因此，各经济部门间的协作是社会主义制度所必需，分工和协作是对立面的统一。分工愈细愈要协作。那种不要协作，不要计划的平衡，只会使国民经济退到无政府状态去，决不是社会主义制度所允许的。
