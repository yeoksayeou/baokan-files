Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 1st: According to TASS, Berlin: The working people of Democratic Berlin warmly celebrated the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Democratic Berlin on November 30th. The slogan they put forward while celebrating the festival was: "Normalize the Berlin situation."

　　On this day, the national flag of the German Democratic Republic and the city flag of Berlin were hung everywhere, and slogans and signboards were decorated everywhere, demanding the realization of the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a city of peace and understanding, and into a demilitarized free city.

　　Hundreds of thousands of citizens of Democratic Berlin participated in the grand parade celebrating the festival. The parade marched with flags and signs through the central avenue of the democratic district—Stalin Avenue. They shouted slogans such as "Berlin is the capital of the German Democratic Republic," "Eliminate the source of war and the unstable state of West Berlin," and "All of Berlin is German!"

　　In front of the Berlin City Hall, the parade enthusiastically cheered and paid tribute to Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Ebert, Mayor of Greater Berlin, and others.

　　Ebert addressed the marchers. He pointed out that the residents of the German Democratic Republic support the policies of the government and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and they are determined to defend their socialist achievements. Ebert emphasized that the Soviet government's proposal on the Berlin issue is a huge contribution to strengthening the cause of peace in Europe. He said that this is another proof of the Soviet people's friendship and trust towards the German people.

　　To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Democratic Berlin, the exhibition "Ten Years of Democratic Berlin - A Proud Summary of the Road to Socialism" was held in the Berlin Sports Palace. All newspapers and periodicals published commemorative articles.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 1st: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, said today: "The road to solving the Berlin problem has been clearly stated in the Soviet proposal. Today, there is no reason for Western countries to occupy West Berlin."

　　Bolz made a report this morning at a meeting of the National Council of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic to discuss the status of West Berlin, on the future of Germany and the way to solve the Berlin problem. He emphasized that the entire Berlin is within the sovereign scope of the German Democratic Republic, and West Berlin must become a non-militarized free city. Only in this way can the relationship between East and West Berlin be normalized. The solution of the Berlin problem will open the way for solving the German problem.

　　Körner, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front, expressed at the meeting that he is willing to discuss the solution of the West Berlin status issue with the people of West Berlin.

　　The meeting has begun to discuss Bolz's report, and representatives from West Germany and West Berlin are participating in the meeting.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 30th: "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial today, warmly welcoming the Soviet government's proposal to normalize the Berlin situation. The editorial wrote that the Soviet government's notes to the German Democratic Republic government, the United States, Britain, France, and the West German government have proposed a road and procedure for solving the Berlin problem. This is a new and important action to ease international tensions, ensure European peace and security, and peacefully resolve the German problem.

　　The editorial said: "Western countries have violated the Potsdam Agreement on all important issues. Not only have they not eradicated German militarism, on the contrary, they have transported atomic and rocket weapons from West Germany to its frontline city—West Berlin—to do bad things. Therefore, Western countries have long lost their legal and moral basis for occupying West Berlin."

　　The editorial continued, therefore, the Western occupying forces must withdraw from West Berlin, and the occupation system in Berlin must be completely eliminated. This will be a contribution to easing international tensions and disarmament. Obviously, the withdrawal of foreign occupying forces and the dispersal of West Berlin's espionage organizations will help ease the tense atmosphere in Germany.

　　The editorial said that West Berlin, under the occupation rule of the Western three countries, has become "the most dangerous source of international tension." The West is obstructing the peaceful solution of the German problem in order to prepare for a war aimed at opposing the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries.

　　The editorial pointed out, however, "the German people will never allow West Berlin to continue to exist as a dangerous hotbed of war. West Berlin should not continue to be a frontline city of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, but should be a demilitarized free city."

    民主柏林几十万游行群众高呼
    “整个柏林是德国人的！”
    博尔茨副总理说西柏林必须成为自由城市
    新华社1日讯  据塔斯社柏林讯：民主柏林的劳动人民11月30日热烈庆祝民主柏林市建立十周年。他们在庆祝节日时提出的口号是：“使柏林状况正常化”。
    这一天，到处都挂着德意志民主共和国的国旗和柏林市的市旗，到处装饰着口号和标语牌，要求实现苏联的建议，把西柏林变成和平和谅解的城市，变成非军事化的自由市。
    民主柏林的几十万市民都参加了庆祝节日的盛大游行。游行队伍打着旗帜，拿着标语牌经过民主区的中央大道——斯大林大街。他们高呼：“柏林是德意志民主共和国的首都”，“消灭战争根源和西柏林的不安定状态”，“整个柏林是德国人的”等口号。
    在柏林市政府大厦前面，游行队伍热情地向德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希和大柏林市市长艾柏特等人欢呼致敬。
    艾柏特向游行者讲了话。他指出，德意志民主共和国居民支持政府和德国统一社会党的政策，他们有决心捍卫自己的社会主义成果。艾柏特强调，苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议是加强欧洲和平事业中的一个巨大贡献。他说，这是苏联人民对德国人民友好和信任的又一证明。
    为纪念民主柏林市建立十周年，在柏林体育馆举办了“民主柏林十周年    值得自豪的走向社会主义的总结”的展览会。各报刊都发表了纪念文章。
    新华社柏林1日电  民主德国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨今天说：“柏林问题解决的道路在苏联的建议中已经说清楚了，今天已经没有任何理由使西方国家占领西柏林了。”
    博尔茨今天上午在民主德国全国阵线全国委员会讨论西柏林地位问题的会议上作了关于德国前途和柏林问题解决的途径的报告。他强调说，整个柏林是在民主德国主权范围之内，西柏林必须成为非军事的自由城市。只有这样，东西柏林的关系才会正常化。柏林问题的解决将为解决德国问题打开道路。
    全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯在开会时表示，愿意和西柏林人民一道商讨解决西柏林地位问题。
    会议已开始讨论博尔茨的报告，参加会议的有从西德和西柏林来的代表。
    新华社柏林30日电  “新德意志报”今天发表社论，热烈欢迎苏联政府为使柏林局势正常化而提出的建议。社论写道，苏联政府最近给民主德国政府、美英法三国和西德政府的照会提出了解决柏林问题的道路和程序，这是缓和国际紧张局势、保障欧洲和平与安全以及和平解决德国问题的一个新的重要行动。
    社论说：“西方国家在所有重要问题上都破坏了波茨坦协定，它们不但没有根除德国军国主义，相反地，却从西德把原子和火箭武器送到它的前线城市——西柏林来干坏事。因此，西方国家早已丧失了它们占领西柏林的法律上和道义上的根据。”
    社论接着说，因此，西方占领军必须撤出西柏林，柏林的占领制度也必须彻底消除。这对缓和国际紧张局势和裁减军备将是一个贡献。很明显，撤退外国占领军和驱散西柏林的特务组织，会有利于缓和德国的紧张气氛。
    社论说，西柏林在西方三国的占领统治下已经变成了“制造国际紧张局势的最危险的策源地”，西方阻挠德国问题的和平解决，是为了准备一次旨在反对民主德国和其他社会主义国家的战争。
    社论指出，但是，“德国人民绝不允许西柏林作为危险的战争温床而继续存在下去。西柏林不应该继续是北大西洋侵略集团的前线城市，而应该是一座非军事化的自由城市”。
