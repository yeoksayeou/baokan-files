The Yuelai and Fulin Communes both belong to the Ma'an District of Yilong County, Sichuan Province. However, due to the different working methods of the cadres, the results obtained are also different. Yuelai Commune, because its cadres are able to follow the mass line and promote democracy, has done a very good job in production and has become a relatively advanced commune in the county. Fulin Commune, because its cadres are unwilling to consult with the masses and even impose compulsory orders on them, has sluggish work and is a relatively backward commune in the county.

The cadres of Yuelai Commune, from top to bottom, lead production through production. Each cadre in this commune has two kinds of fields: one is a high-yield experimental field, with the main purpose of creating high yields. This field is jointly responsible for cultivation by cadres and commune members; the other is a command field, which is jointly responsible for by cadres, activists, and experienced elderly farmers, with the main purpose of guiding technology. When the commune proposed changing this year's wheat from spot sowing to wide and narrow strip sowing, the masses responded that it was difficult to do and too troublesome. The cadres and experienced farmers then made a model in the command field, held an on-site meeting, and organized the masses to visit and learn. The commune members reflected, "It's better to see once than to hear a hundred times; once you see it, you understand." As a result, all of the more than 7,000 mu of wheat sown this year in the commune met the specifications and the quality was very good. Fulin Commune, however, is not like this. The cadres of this commune use their mouths more and their hands less. Although they also convene meetings with the masses, they only arrange work, assign tasks, and set deadlines for completion. They don't even explain the sowing specifications. Of the more than ten Party branch secretaries in the commune, only three or four regularly participate in production. Many production team leaders do not go to the fields to work, but only shout from the sidelines. Zhang Chaoli, the captain of the Third Brigade, wears leather shoes, holds a loudspeaker, and shouts loudly everywhere, ordering each commune member to sow so much each day and to complete it within a time limit, etc., while he does not even touch a farm tool. It is a common phenomenon that they do not understand the production situation. Branch Secretary Peng Guangxiang reported to the Party Committee that the quality of cultivation met the specifications, but after inspection, it was found that some commune members were still using the extensive cultivation method of planting peas in plow furrows. Because the thinking of the masses was not well resolved and they did not understand the technical specifications in detail, the progress of spring ploughing and sowing this year in this commune was slow and the quality was poor, making it a backward commune in the county's (four autumns) work.

As long as everything is discussed with the commune members and the masses are relied upon to find solutions, any work can be done well and any difficulties can be overcome. This is the experience Yuelai Commune has drawn from the recent autumn ploughing and autumn sowing. This year, Yuelai Commune transferred a portion of its labor force to support industry, and the (four autumns) work was heavier than in previous years. It involved autumn harvesting, autumn storage, deep ploughing, zonal fertilization, wheat strip sowing, and the construction of large-scale high-yield fields. Completing these tasks in a short period of time was indeed not an easy thing. At first, in order to complete the tasks in a timely manner, the commune members worked desperately day and night, becoming exhausted. What to do? The cadres of Yuelai Commune went to consult with the masses to find solutions. Each production team held meetings with elderly farmers as technical consultants to study how to work skillfully. The masses said, "Work is done by people, and tools are made by people." They decided to launch a tool reform campaign, and a tool reform movement was launched throughout the commune. Through demonstration visits, many deep ploughing and sowing tools were promoted. Commune members offered suggestions and ideas, and many new tools and new methods emerged. The three-eight strip sowing machine created by commune member Huang Yunde increased work efficiency by three times. The wheat deep-furrow narrow-row sowing method created by commune member Xiao Yongzhong has been widely promoted throughout the county. However, Fulin Commune is different. This commune also proposed tool reform, but it was not successful. The commune mobilized carpenters to manufacture a large number of wheat five-row sowing machines and single-row strip sowing machines, which were distributed to various production teams for promotion and use. Because the benefits of reforming tools were not vigorously publicized in advance and the techniques for using them were not meticulously taught, some commune members were unwilling to use them, saying that they were not as good as old-fashioned farm tools. Because the task could not be completed, the cadres forced the commune members to increase the intensity of labor, making the commune members exhausted and the work efficiency one-third lower than usual.

The work in Yuelai Commune has not been smooth sailing; mistakes have also occurred, but they are good at correcting mistakes. Not long after Yuelai Commune was established, it collectively raised pigs. Due to a lack of experience, a large number of pigs died, and commune members raised their opinions. The commune immediately convened a meeting of breeders, mobilized everyone to speak out and debate, organized visits to good breeding farms, summarized good breeding management experience, and promoted it throughout the commune. At the same time, they launched a "Ten Goods for Pig Raising" activity month and implemented a pig raising responsibility system. Therefore, the situation quickly improved. Fulin Commune also experienced the phenomenon of pig deaths, but the method of dealing with it was completely different. After the phenomenon of large-scale death of live pigs occurred, Wang Shaohe (who has been removed from his post), the responsible cadre of the commune's sideline production department, gathered the breeders of the four brigades with serious deaths, and severely reprimanded and insulted them. Doing so, of course, would not stop the phenomenon of death. Thirty more pigs died in these four brigades within half a month.

Due to the promotion of democracy and continuous patient political and ideological education, the ideological awareness of the commune members of Yuelai Commune has improved rapidly, and a communist spirit of cooperation has been established. In the spring sowing, the Third Brigade of this commune, because the tools were not good, the quality of cultivation was poor, and the sowing did not meet the specifications, other teams put up big-character posters to criticize them. The commune immediately mobilized everyone to help. The First Brigade immediately sent commune members to help them transform the old plowshares into deep ploughing plows, changing the method so that the quality of deep ploughing and sowing throughout the commune was consistent. Fulin Commune, however, is a different scene. The three brigades, three, eight and nine, of this commune were busy harvesting sweet potatoes, so that the wheat sowing work fell behind. The commune prepared to mobilize the brigades that had completed their tasks to provide support. However, because they were not well mobilized, no one was mobilized as a result.

Recently, under the guidance of the higher-level Party Committee, the cadres of Fulin Commune have realized their mistakes and are starting to correct them.

    花异果不同
    本报记者  孙跃冬
    悦来公社和福临公社，同属于四川省仪陇县马鞍区。由于干部的工作方法不同，得到的结果也不同。悦来公社由于干部能够走群众路线，发扬民主，生产搞得很好，成为全县比较先进的公社。福临公社由于干部不愿和群众商量甚至对群众施行强迫命令，工作疲沓，是全县比较落后的公社。
    悦来公社的干部，从上到下，都是通过生产来领导生产的。这个公社的每个干部都有两种田：一种是高产试验田，以创造高产为主要目的。这种田由干部和社员共同负责耕种；一种是指挥田，由干部、积极分子和有经验的老年农民共同负责，以指导技术为主。公社提出把今年小麦改点播为宽窄幅条播时，群众反映不好搞，太麻烦。干部们就和有经验的农民在指挥田里作出样子，召开现场会，组织群众参观学习。社员反映说：“千说不如一见，一见就通。”因而今年全社播种的七千多亩小麦都合乎规格，质量很好。福临公社却不是这样。这个公社干部动嘴多，动手少。虽然他们也召集群众开会，但只是布置工作，交代任务，限期完成。连播种规格也不交代。全社十多个党分支书记，经常参加生产的只有三、四人。许多生产队长不下地干活，而只用手在一边叫喊。三大队队长张朝礼，脚穿皮鞋，拿着喇叭筒，到处大叫大嚷，命令每个社员每天播种多少多少，限期完成等等，而自己连农具也不摸一下。对于生产情形不了解，是普遍的现象。分支书记彭光祥，向社党委汇报说，耕作质量都合规格，但是经过检查以后，发现仍有社员采用种犁沟豌豆的粗放耕种方法。由于群众思想解决的不好，对技术规格了解得不具体，因而这个社今年小春深耕播种进展迟缓，质量也差，成为全县（四秋）工作落后社。
    只要事事和社员商量，依靠群众想办法，什么工作也能作好，什么困难也能克服，这是悦来公社从最近秋耕秋种中得出的经验。今年，悦来公社抽调了一部分劳动力支援工业，（四秋）工作又比往年重，要秋收、秋藏、深耕、分区施肥、小麦条播、建大面积高产田等。在短期内完成这样一些工作，的确不是一件容易的事情。起初，为了及时完成任务，社员们日夜拼命干，弄得筋疲力竭。怎么办呢？悦来公社的干部便去和群众商量解决办法。各生产队都召开了老年农民技术顾问会，研究如何巧干。群众说，“活路是人做出来的，工具是人造出来的”，他们决定大闹工具改革，全社展开工具改革运动。通过示范参观，许多深耕、播种工具推广开来。社员们献策献计，出现许多新工具和新方法。社员黄云德创造的三八条播器，提高工效三倍。社员萧永忠创造的小麦深沟窄厢播种法，已在全县普遍推广。但是，福临公社却不同。这个社也曾提出工具改革的事情，但是没有成功。社里动员木工制造出大量小麦五行播种器和单行条播器，分发到各个生产队推广使用。由于事前没有大张旗鼓地宣传改革工具的好处和细致地传授使用技术，因而有些社员不愿使用，说什么不如旧式农具好。因为任务无法完成，干部就强迫社员提高劳动强度，弄得社员疲累不堪，工效比平时还低三分之一。
    悦来公社在工作中也并非一帆风顺的，也曾发生过错误，但是他们善于改正错误。悦来公社建立不久，就集体喂养生猪。由于经验不够，发生了猪只大量死亡现象，社员纷纷提出意见。公社立即召开饲养员会议，发动大家鸣放辩论，组织前往好的饲养场参观，总结好的饲养管理经验，在全社推广。同时，边开展养猪十好运动月，实行了养猪责任制。因此，情况很快得到好转。福临公社也发生死猪的现象，但是对待的方法却完全不同。在发生毛猪大量死亡现象以后，公社副业生产部门的负责干部王少和（已撤职），把死亡严重的四个大队的饲养员集中在一起，大加斥责和辱骂。这样做，死亡现象当然不会停止。这四个大队在半个月内又死猪三十头。
    由于发扬了民主和不断耐心地进行政治思想教育，悦来公社的社员思想觉悟提高很快，树立了共产主义协作精神。在小春播种中，这个公社的第三大队，因为工具不好，耕作质量差，播种也不合规格，其他队贴大字报提出批评。公社立即发动大家进行帮助。一大队立即派出社员去帮助他们将旧犁头改装成深耕犁，改变了方法，使全社深耕播种质量一致。福临公社却是另一番情景。这个社的三、八、九三个大队，因为忙着收获红苕，以致小麦播种工作掉在后面。公社准备调动已完成任务的大队去支援。但因未好好动员，结果，一个人也调不动。
    最近，福临公社干部在上级党委的指导下，已认识到自己的错误，正着手进行改正。
