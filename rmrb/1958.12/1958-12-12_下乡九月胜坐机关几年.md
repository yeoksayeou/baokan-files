    Nine Months in the Countryside Beats Several Years in the Office
    Zang Chengyao, Captain of the Agricultural Department's Downward Transfer Cadre Brigade

    Our labor training is about to end. How well did we train? We made a summary. The conclusion is: "Nine months of downward transfer labor training are better than several years of sitting in the office."

    We need to calculate a large harvest here; the bill cannot be fully itemized. First of all, the gains in political ideology are significant. We not only put down our airs and were willing to be good sons and daughters of the masses, changed our feelings and cherished crops and commune property like our own eyes, but also had one hundred and fourteen people selected as county-level socialist construction activists, and six people accepted into the Communist Party. In this regard, there is no need to cite more specific examples. Because, few people have doubted that downward transfer training can yield a bountiful harvest in political ideology. However, some people still say: Downward transfer training is "only red but not expert." It trains the mind but not the skills. After all the training, it is guaranteed that one will be politically progressive but professionally backward.

    However, their presumptions have fallen flat. We have not only made unprecedented great progress in political ideology and unprecedented great strengthening in physical fitness, but also achieved unprecedented great improvements in professional skills and scientific knowledge.

    The accounts in this regard need to be calculated.

    Among our one hundred and seventy-one people, 82% are agricultural technical cadres or young students from colleges and universities. When we first arrived, some people doubted whether we could improve our scientific and technical level and conduct scientific research during labor training. But in just nine months, we have achieved great success in both production practice and science and technology.

    1. We learned real skills and cured the "empty talk" disease. In the past, those who talked about plant diseases and insect pests could only talk about what disease, how to prevent it, and how to treat it, but when they went to the front lines of plant diseases and insect pests, they couldn't even distinguish between Zhang San and Li Si, let alone know how to do it; wheat experts could talk about "wheat fields should be leveled, and seeds should be sown evenly," but they just couldn't level the ground or sow the seeds evenly; graduates of agricultural mechanization colleges couldn't operate gas engines; and those who studied animal husbandry and veterinary medicine couldn't find the thyroid gland of pigs after looking for it for several days when they wanted to give them thyroidectomies. But what about now? General tasks (pushing waterwheels, digging pits and ponds, making ridges and furrows, hoeing, preventing frost, harvesting crops, field management, etc.) have been learned, and complex tasks (sweet potato seedling raising, making tobacco ridges, tobacco seed germination, plowing and harrowing, wheat sowing, tobacco hybridization, starting vehicles, manufacturing ball bearings, coking, operating gas engines, etc.) have also been learned.

    2. Things that we dared not even think about in the past can now be made with our own hands. For example, some high yields that we dared not imagine in the past in offices and research institutes have now been created by our own hands. The sweet potato experimental field planted by Comrade Cao Li yielded more than 18,000 jin per mu; the tobacco experimental field yielded more than 1,600 jin per mu; the radish experimental field yielded 36,000 jin per mu; the cabbage yielded more than 66,000 jin per mu, etc. These are not considered very high in the country, but for those of us who only read books and sat in offices in the past, these were indeed yields that we dared not imagine!

    3. We sowed the seeds of science and popularized scientific knowledge. In the experimental fields, various professional teams vigorously carried out professional activities, imparting agricultural scientific knowledge to farmers. We have trained a total of 16,700 technical personnel of various types. We covered all aspects of indigenous fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, plant diseases and insect pests, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine. We established factories with simple equipment to produce large quantities of bacterial fertilizers. In the past, it cost 10,000 yuan to build a factory, but now 1,000 yuan is enough, saving 90%.

    4. There were also unexpected gains in scientific research. All downward transfer cadres wrote a total of 235 scientific and technical summaries and technical papers, of which 62 were relatively good and more than 20 were the best. This great harvest in science and technology and scientific research proves the victory of the policy of cultivating cadres who are both red and expert through labor training.

    The accounts have been calculated, and a few more words need to be said about "better than sitting in the office for several years." For us, the downward transfer cadres, nine months of training have indeed exceeded the gains of the past few years in the office. But this does not mean that the office is bad. The problem lies with the people. From the perspective of most of us, in the past, we were first divorced from the masses, second divorced from reality, and third, our limbs were not diligent. It is indeed difficult for such people to make rapid progress simply by sitting in the office. Once we go down to the countryside, we combine with the masses and take the masses as our teachers, and this yields politics; knowledge is combined with labor practice, and this yields high yields and science; and our muscles and bones are exercised, and naturally we grow stronger. With these three combinations, significant results are achieved in a short period of time, which is only natural. Moreover, returning to the office will naturally bring vitality to the office.

    下乡九月胜坐机关几年
    农业部下放干部大队队长  臧成耀
    劳动锻炼要结束了，锻炼得怎么样？我们作了一个总结。结论是：“下放劳动锻炼九个月，胜过机关坐几年。”
    要在这里算一大笔丰收账，账单是开不完的。首先，政治思想上的收获很大，不仅放下了架子，甘心作群众的好儿女；改变了感情，爱护庄稼和公社财产像爱护自己的眼睛；而且有一百一十四个人，被选作县的社会主义建设积极分子，六个人被接受加入了共产党。在这方面，不需要举更多具体的例证了。因为，很少有人怀疑过，下放锻炼能在政治思想上获得丰收。但是，还有人说：下放锻炼是“只红不专”，锻炼了思想，锻炼不了业务，锻炼一通以后，保管是政治上进步了，业务上退步了。
    然而，他们的妄断落空了。我们不仅在政治思想上有了空前的大进步，体力上有了空前的大加强，而且业务上和科学知识上也有了空前的大提高。
    这方面的账倒是需要算一算的。
    我们一百七十一个人中，82％的人是农业技术干部，大专学校的青年学生。刚一下来，也有人怀疑，在劳动锻炼中能不能提高科学技术水平，能不能搞科学研究。但是仅仅九个月，无论生产实践上和科学技术上都获得了巨大成就。
    一、学得了实本事，治好了“空头”病。过去讲病虫害的只能讲什么病怎样防，怎样治，可是一到病虫害面前去，却连张三李四也分不清，就更谈不到怎样动手了；小麦专家会讲“麦子地要整平，撒籽要均匀”，但就是地也整不了，籽也撒不匀；农业机械化学院毕业的，不会开煤气机；研究畜牧兽医的人，要给猪割甲状腺，找了好几天，找不到猪的甲状腺在哪里。可是现在怎么样呢？一般活（推水车、挖坑塘、打垅起畦、锄地、防霜、收割庄稼、田间管理等等）学会了，复杂的活（红薯育苗、打烟畦、烟籽催芽、耕地耙地、播麦、烟草杂交、开动车、制造滚珠轴承、炼焦、开煤气机等等）也学会了。
    二、过去想也不敢想的事，现在亲手作得出。比如过去在机关里和研究所里不敢想像的一些高额产量，现在是经我们自己的手创造出来了。曹黎同志种的红薯试验田，亩产一万八千多斤；烟叶试验田亩产一千六百多斤；萝卜试验田亩产三万六千斤；白菜亩产六万六千多斤，等等，这些在全国来说，都不算是很高的，但对于我们过去只看书本、坐机关的人来说，过去确实是不敢设想的产量啊！
    三、撒下了科学种籽，普及了科学知识。在搞试验田中，各专业组织大搞专业活动，把农业科学知识传授给农民。我们共训练了各种技术人员一万六千七百人。土制化肥，细菌肥料，病虫害，畜牧兽医等方面样样都有。用简陋的设备建立起来了生产大量菌肥的工厂。过去建一个厂得一万元，现在一千元就够了，节省90％。
    四、科学研究方面也有了意外的收获。全体下放干部共写出科学技术总结和技术论文二百三十五篇，其中较好的有六十二篇，最好的有二十余篇，这种科学技术和科学研究上的大丰收，证明了是通过劳动锻炼来培养又红又专的干部的政策的胜利。
    账算过了，关于“胜过机关坐几年”，还要说几句。对我们下放干部来说，九个月的锻炼的确是超过了过去几年在机关中的收获。但是这却不能说明机关不好，问题发生在人的身上。从我们多数人来看，过去一是脱离群众，二是脱离实际，三是四肢不勤。这样的人只是坐在机关里，的确难以有很快的长进。一到下边，人同群众结合了，以群众为师，这就出政治；知识同劳动实践结合了，这就出丰产和科学；筋骨受到了锻炼，自然也就长了力气。有了这三结合，短短的时间，获得显著的成绩，这也就是自然的。而且再回到机关里自然也就会给机关里带来生气。
