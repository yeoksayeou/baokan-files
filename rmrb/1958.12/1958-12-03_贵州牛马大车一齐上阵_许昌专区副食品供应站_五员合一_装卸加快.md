Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, December 2nd: Guizhou is about to launch a mass transport movement to quickly transport industrial products to the countryside and transport purchased agricultural products out.

Currently, transportation departments, commercial departments, and people's communes across the province are mobilizing transportation forces, tapping transportation potential, organizing ox carts and horse carts into action, and doing everything possible to break through the transportation barrier. All vehicles of the transportation companies throughout the province have implemented a double-shift system for day and night transportation. 86% of these vehicles are equipped with various types of trailers, the majority of which are made of wood and bamboo. Provincial and municipal leadership departments are also incorporating the self-use vehicles of institutions and enterprises into the transportation force for industrial and agricultural products. Commercial departments are cooperating with people's communes to build ox carts and horse carts on a large scale, planning to build 37,000 units in early December, and organizing commune members to participate in transportation. Special district (autonomous prefecture) and county authorities have now established specialized transportation shock teams. The Director of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Transportation Bureau personally took charge, focusing on mass transportation on one hand and the manufacture of ox carts, horse carts, and wooden sailboats on the other. In recent days, the volume of transportation has increased significantly, with ox cart and horse cart transportation exceeding automobile transportation by 1.9 times.

According to statistics from relevant departments, the province has already purchased agricultural and sideline products worth over 500 million yuan. To quickly transport such a large quantity of agricultural products, it is necessary to rely on the broad masses of people and make full use of all available tools to organize transportation.

This newspaper reports: The staff of the Second Non-Staple Food Supply Station of the Xuchang Special Administrative Office Commercial Bureau in Henan Province have implemented a "five-in-one" system in dispatching and transporting business (referring to the "five-in-one" of business, accounting, pricing, warehousing, and dispatching). Since the trial implementation, it has not only greatly reduced loading and unloading time and accelerated vehicle turnover, but also simplified internal procedures and saved manpower.

The specific method of the "five-in-one" system is to assign the work of the original five people to one person, handling everything from issuing tickets, pricing, sorting goods, consignment, and loading, reversing the previous chaotic and passive phenomena of mutual non-communication. The warehouse keepers of different varieties of goods contact each other once a month to understand the dispatching situation, which facilitates the centralized allocation of goods and timely loading and unloading.

The "five-in-one" system has many advantages. First, it greatly reduces loading and unloading time. In the past, because warehouse keepers had no prior knowledge of the delivery location, quantity, and variety, they could not prepare in advance. Only after the vehicle arrived would they piece things together, thus greatly extending the loading and unloading time, with loading and unloading taking more than an hour being a common occurrence. Drivers and loading and unloading workers had complaints about this. After implementing the "five-in-one" system, attention is paid to the matching of goods when issuing tickets, and scattered materials can be concentrated in advance. According to the different carrying capacity of the vehicles, the materials are divided into several cargo spaces, marked with the weight, and a three-fix system is implemented (namely, fix the goods, fix the quantity, and fix the personnel), so that the loading can be done immediately upon the arrival of the vehicle. Now, the general loading and unloading time only takes ten minutes, and the loading and unloading of difficult goods does not exceed half an hour. Secondly, it enables the timely transportation of goods, overcoming the phenomenon of backlog. Now, it takes only one day from issuing the ticket to shipping out the goods, which is three days shorter than before, and it can be closely integrated with the transportation department to understand the vehicle dynamics, so that the goods can be distributed with a clear understanding, so as to achieve no backlog in the warehouse. Thirdly, it simplifies unnecessary procedures, saves manpower, and also basically eliminates errors and accidents.

### 贵州牛马大车一齐上阵  许昌专区副食品供应站“五员合一”装卸加快

    贵州牛马大车一齐上阵
    许昌专区副食品供应站“五员合一”装卸加快
    据新华社贵阳2日电  贵州即将掀起一个全民运输运动，迅速把工业品运往农村，把收购的农产品运输出去。
    现在全省各地的运输部门、商业部门和人民公社都在调集运输大军，大挖运输潜力，组织牛马车上阵，千方百计大闯运输关。全省各个运输公司所有的汽车，都实行了双班制日夜运输，其中有86％的车辆挂有各式各样的拖车，这些拖车的绝大部分构件是用木、竹做成的。省、市各级领导部门还把机关企业自用车辆编入工农业产品的运输队伍。商业部门正配合人民公社大造牛马车，计划在12月上旬赶造出三万七千部，组织公社社员参加运输。各专区（州）、县现已成立运输专业突击队伍。黔南布依族苗族自治州交通局长亲自出马，一手抓群众运输，一手抓牛马车和木帆船的制造，近几天来运量显著上升，牛马车运输量超过汽车运输量一点九倍。
    据有关部门统计，目前全省已收购的农副产品约值五亿多元，这样多的农产品要迅速运出去，只有依靠广大群众，充分利用一切可以利用的工具组织运输才行。
    本报讯  河南省许昌专署商业局副食品供应二站的职工在调运业务上试行了“五员合一”（指业务、会计、物价、保管、调运的“五员合一”）。试行以来，不仅大大压缩了装卸时间、加速了车辆周转，同时简化了内部手续，节省了人力。
    “五员合一”的具体做法是把原来五个人的工作交由一个人办理，从开票、划价、理货、托运、装车一包到底，扭转了以往互不通气的忙乱、被动现象。各个不同品种的保管员，每月联系一次，以了解调运情况，便于集中配货，及时装卸。
    “五员合一”好处很多，首先是大大压缩了装卸时间。以往由于保管员事前没底，不知发货地点、数量和品种，所以不能及早准备，车到后才东拼西凑，因此大大延长了装卸时间，装卸要一小时以上是常见的事。司机和装卸工人对此都有意见。实行“五员合一”后，在开票时就注意到货物的搭配，并能事先把零星的物资集中一起，根据车辆不同的载重量分成若干货位，标明重量，实行三定（即定货物、定数量、定人员），车到即装。现在一般装卸时间只需十几分钟，难装货物的装卸也不超过半小时。其次，使货物能够及时运出，克服了积压现象。现在由开票到运出，一天即可办完，比过去缩短三天，并能与运输部门密切结合，了解车辆动态，在分发货时心中有底，做到仓库无积压。再次，简化了不必要的手续，节省了人力，还基本消灭了差错事故。
