    Promoting the Masses' Study of Philosophy
    Shandong Province Establishes Philosophical Society
    To mobilize the masses to study philosophy and carry out philosophical research, the Shandong Provincial Philosophical Society was officially established on December 12.
    At the inaugural meeting of the Philosophical Society, the attending representatives fully discussed the current guidelines and tasks of philosophical work. The meeting considered that many new things have emerged in the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement in the past year, and they all need to be theoretically understood and explained anew. Therefore, theoretical work must resolutely adhere to the "policy of focusing on the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and guided by the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism" as stated by Comrade Mao Zedong, to study the theoretical problems encountered in China, especially Shandong Province, in the practice of socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    The meeting also held that the Philosophical Society is a mass academic organization, and it should follow the mass line even more, to become an organization that promotes the masses' study of philosophy. At the same time, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of combining popularization with improvement.

    推动群众学哲学
    山东省成立哲学学会
    为了发动群众学习哲学和开展哲学研究工作，山东省哲学学会于12月12日正式成立。
    在哲学学会成立的会议上，到会的代表们对当前哲学工作的方针和任务作了充分的讨论。会议认为：一年来的大跃进和人民公社化运动中出现了许多新的事物，都需要从理论上去作新的了解和说明。因此，理论工作必须坚决根据毛泽东同志所说的“以研究中国革命实际问题为中心，以马克思列宁主义基本原则为指导的方针”，去研究我国特别是山东省在社会主义革命和社会主义建设实践中遇到的理论问题。
    会议还认为，哲学学会是群众性的学术团体，更应该走群众路线，要成为推动群众学哲学的组织。同时要坚持普及与提高相结合的方针。
