Demonic Claws伸 Everywhere, A Noose Tightens Around The Body

Global Base Network

U.S. imperialism acts as a "protector" everywhere, piecing together military blocs, seizing military bases, stationing troops, and collecting cannon fodder. The United States is preparing for a new world war, using military bases as strongholds and military blocs as means. This exposes the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism, which are more arrogant and dangerous than any aggressor in the past.

According to incomplete statistics, the United States has established 270 major military bases in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, West Berlin, West Germany, Western Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and other regions. The places with the highest concentration of military bases are West Germany (24 bases), Japan (19 bases), and the United Kingdom (18 bases). At the same time, the United States disperses its limited troops to these bases, with approximately 350,000 in Europe, around 200,000 in the Far East, 15,000 in North Africa, and over 20,000 in the Caribbean region. After the Soviet Union's red satellite ascended to space, the international situation underwent a significant shift with the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The strategic position of the United States in its world aggression plummeted. The United States is now hastily planning to establish a missile base network in various locations. The United States has already signed a missile base agreement with the United Kingdom. Italy has also agreed to establish U.S. missile bases on its territory. The United States is exerting pressure to force France and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to accept the establishment of U.S. missile bases. In the Middle East and the Far East, the United States is also intensifying these activities.

Acquiring by Deceit and Force

The U.S. ruling group employs various despicable and malicious means to establish and expand U.S. military bases in other countries' territories. The process of the United States establishing a base network is a process of aggression, acquiring other countries' independence and territorial sovereignty by deceit and force. During World War II, the United States began to exploit the difficulties of other countries to seize military bases. For example, in the autumn of 1940, Britain suffered heavy losses to its merchant ships due to pirate attacks by Nazi German submarines, placing it in a very difficult position. The United States then used this situation to force Britain to agree to lease bases in the western Atlantic to the United States for ninety-nine years, while the price Britain received was merely fifty old destroyers. At the same time, under the pretext of "resisting" the aggression of Hitler's Germany and Japan, the United States arbitrarily sent its troops to other countries to establish bases, and when the war ended, it continued to赖着不走 (refuse to leave). Iceland is such an example. U.S. troops entered this country in 1941. At the time, U.S. President Roosevelt had even guaranteed that once the war ended, U.S. troops would withdraw immediately. But now, thirteen years after the war ended, the Icelandic government has formally requested the withdrawal of U.S. troops, but U.S. troops stubbornly occupy the base in Iceland.

The United States is even more unbridled towards the defeated countries of West Germany and Japan. From the beginning of the occupation, the United States has arbitrarily and massively constructed military facilities. In the U.S. global base network, the number of bases in Japan and West Germany is the largest, and the scale is also the largest.

The United States also uses "U.S. aid" to swindle bases. This is one of the most common methods used by the United States. The United States gives certain countries some weapons or dollars, which results in many important areas and ports of these countries becoming U.S. military bases. After Greece accepted "aid" from the "Marshall Plan" in 1948, it signed a military agreement with the United States, allowing the United States to establish military bases in Greece. The United States has also widely used this deceptive trick on other countries to seize military bases.

Piecing together military aggression groups is also an important method used by the United States to seize foreign bases. Whether it is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact Organization, or the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, all have opened the door for the United States to establish bases. In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries alone, the United States has dozens of bases, and these bases are also funded by the governments of the host countries.

The United States has used these political, economic, and military deception and pressure tactics to forcibly occupy other countries' territories as its own military bases.

Spreading Seeds of Death

When the United States seizes military bases abroad, it always waves the banner of so-called "defending against communist aggression." This is a complete lie. The rulers and generals of the United States have long made no secret of the fact that their establishment of military bases abroad is to prepare to "strike the Russian heartland." And the facts of the past few years have also proven that the United States uses its bases abroad as strongholds for attacking and invading socialist countries and national independent countries. In 1950, the United States used the military bases in South Korea and Japan to launch the war of aggression against Korea. At the beginning of this year, a rebellion occurred in Indonesia, and the United States used the base in the Philippines to provide weapons to the Indonesian rebels. And the recent U.S. military aggression against Lebanon and the military provocations against our country in the Taiwan Strait were also carried out using its military bases in West Germany, Turkey, the Philippines, and Taiwan as springboards for transporting weapons and invading troops. In this situation, the people of those countries that have U.S. military bases on their soil, especially missile bases, face extremely serious dangers. Because they may be drawn into a war of aggression against their wishes at any time, which, apart from the possibility of causing devastating disasters to these countries, has no other benefit.

Infringing on Independent Sovereignty

When the United States establishes military bases abroad, it often raises the banner of so-called "guaranteeing the security of small countries." But in reality, it is the most brutal infringement on the territorial sovereignty of these countries. For example, the U.S. control over the bases in the Philippines has far exceeded the scope of airports or harbor facilities, and even an administrative area as large as a city or a county is entirely under the jurisdiction of the U.S. garrison commander. The United States established military bases in Morocco based on the Franco-American agreement, but when Morocco gained independence and demanded that the United States return the bases, the United States refused. When the Icelandic parliament passed a resolution in 1956 demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iceland, Dulles openly declared that the resolution of the Icelandic parliament "has no effect internationally." Look, to what extent does the United States despise the sovereignty of other countries. In addition to this, U.S. troops, relying on extraterritoriality, exemption from tariffs, and other privileges, engage in smuggling and commit all kinds of crimes, causing countless criminal cases. From October 1953 to June 1958, in Japan alone, there were more than 33,000 criminal cases.

But more seriously: At present, with the establishment of U.S. missile bases, this loss of sovereignty in various countries has reached a dangerous degree. Because according to the agreement, only the United States has the right to decide whether to use nuclear missiles, while countries with missile bases have no say in this matter. This is tantamount to handing over the fate of these countries entirely to the U.S. aggressors.

Opposition Everywhere

Because the establishment of military bases by the United States brings such profound harm and threats to various countries, it inevitably traps it in the opposition of the people of various countries. The struggle of the people of various countries against U.S. military bases is rising day by day.

The struggle of the people of Western European countries against U.S. military bases for a long time is concentrating its fire to prevent the United States from establishing missile bases. Last year, representatives of the peace movements of nine Western European countries, including Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy, took the lead in holding a meeting in Paris, calling on the people of various countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to oppose the U.S. missile base plan. After the signing of the U.S.-British missile base agreement, on March 1 of this year, Britain launched the "National Protest U.S. Occupation Day" movement. The largest political gathering in the past ten years was held in Glasgow, Scotland, to protest the establishment of a missile base by the United States in this city. On the 6th and 7th of this month, the people of Norfolk in eastern England also held large demonstrations for two consecutive days to oppose the construction of a U.S. missile base in the area. In West Germany, according to a recent public opinion poll, 83% of West German residents opposed the establishment of U.S. missile bases in West Germany. The French people demand that De Gaulle should fundamentally refuse the establishment of U.S. missile bases in France, rather than just bargaining. The governments of Denmark and Norway have consistently refused the U.S. request to establish missile bases.

In Greece, the people's will to oppose the establishment of U.S. military missile bases was clearly demonstrated in the general election in May of this year. As a result of the election, the National Radical Union, which advocated the establishment of U.S. missile bases, suffered a serious defeat, with nearly 60% of voters voting against it; while the Unified Democratic Left Party, which opposed the establishment of U.S. military bases, achieved a great victory.

The flames of the Japanese people's struggle against bases are burning the most fiercely. The national representative conference of the Japan National Liaison Council Against Military Bases held in April of this year, as well as the "Central Assembly to Stop Nuclear Armament of Japan and Uphold Democracy" held in Tokyo not long ago, fully demonstrated the Japanese people's firm will to oppose the United States turning Japan into a nuclear war base. The resolutions of the two conferences both demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan and called on the people to fight to the end for this. At present, the Japanese people's struggle against bases is closely linked with the struggle against the establishment of a new military alliance system by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the demand for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

In Okinawa, the people have waged a long and unyielding struggle against the U.S. conspiracy to drive away Mayor Senaga of Naha City, who firmly wanted to cancel the U.S. occupation. When the United States used threats and high-pressure tactics to force Senaga to step down, the struggle was not stopped. The people of Okinawa elected Kaneji Saiichi, who also opposed the U.S. military occupation, as the mayor of Naha City, and the progressive forces supporting Kaneji won the victory in the supplementary election of the Okinawa City Council. In May of this year, the councils of various cities, towns, and villages in Okinawa submitted written requests to the U.S. government based on the resolutions of the plenary meeting, opposing the United States from transporting nuclear weapons into Okinawa.

"Yankee, Go Home"

In other parts of Asia, even in the Philippines, which is under U.S. military, economic, and political control, due to the pressure of the people, the Philippine government held negotiations with the United States in the autumn of 1956 to revise the base agreement. In the two years since the United States interrupted the negotiations, the struggle of the people of all walks of life in the Philippines against U.S. bases has continued.

"Yankee, go home!" This resounding slogan has also resounded on the African land. In Morocco, the U.S. action of arbitrarily establishing an atomic bomber base in disregard of Moroccan sovereignty has angered the Moroccan people. The vast number of working people, political leaders, and newspaper opinion have all condemned the unreasonable behavior of the United States. A movement demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases has swept across Morocco. In July of this year, the Moroccan National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution demanding that "all foreign troops withdraw from Morocco."

Targets and Isolated Islands

Dulles also shouted self-deceptively, "This kind of base greatly increases the effectiveness of our deterrent force." This is entirely the fantasy of a madman. At a time when the strength of the socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong, the U.S. military bases, whether they are missile bases or strategic nuclear bomber bases, cannot change the basic fact that, as Mr. Mock, the representative of France at the United Nations Disarmament Group Committee, once said: Because the Soviet Union has intercontinental missiles, today the United States is in the "front line" position where it can be attacked. Secondly, U.S. military bases abroad can threaten others, but its exposed bases everywhere have also become targets for others to counterattack. Comrade Khrushchev said it well, he said:

"If U.S. military bases are very close to the Soviet border, then it can also be said that the Soviet Union is not far from these bases. Therefore, if the aggressors launch a war, then the Soviet Union, with its already tested and perfected weapons, can not only destroy these bases, but also give a devastating counterattack to more distant targets." Not only that, but in fact, the strategic policy formulated by the United States relying on military bases also has its own fatal weaknesses, namely: long battle lines and dispersed forces. The U.S. military strength is limited, and its bases around the world, some are 6,000 kilometers away from the United States, and some are more than 10,000 kilometers away, and they are spread extremely widely. If the United States launches a world war, it will be a big problem to maintain these bases and carry out military supplies. This weakness of the U.S. military base policy was clearly exposed in the U.S. armed aggression against the Middle East and the military provocations in the Taiwan Strait region this year. When the United States sent troops to Lebanon, it had to draw troops from Europe and other regions, and when it provoked us in the Taiwan Strait region, it had to gather troops from all over the world. In these two places alone, the United States was so overwhelmed and exhausted. If it fought on several, dozens, or even hundreds of fronts at the same time, it would be even more difficult to cope with. Therefore, as the broad world opinion points out, in the current situation, the U.S. military bases have become "targets" for missile strikes and "isolated islands" surrounded by enemies on all sides. Even in peacetime, it is impossible for the United States to赖着不走 (refuse to leave) from the bases. As the wave of popular opposition continues to rise, U.S. bases are increasingly in danger of being swallowed by the waves. The victory of the Iraqi revolution has shattered one of the fortresses in the Middle East that was considered stubborn by the United States and other imperialists.

The United States establishes a global military base network to oppose socialist countries, oppose national independent countries, and threaten the people of all countries. But the development of things has gone against the wishes of the U.S. imperialists. U.S. military bases have helped the people of various countries see the ferocious face of the U.S. aggressors, mobilized more people to rise up against it, and plunged the United States into the opposition of the people of the world. The chain of military bases has become countless nooses around its neck. (Attached image)

    美帝国主义到处充当“保护人”，拼凑军事集团，强占军事基地，派驻军队，搜罗炮灰。美国是在以军事基地为据点，以军事集团为手段，准备新的世界大战。这暴露了美帝国主义比过去任何侵略者都更狂妄更危险的侵略野心。
    据不完全的统计，美国已在南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾、西柏林、西德、西欧、北非、中东以及其他地区建立了二百七十个主要军事基地。其中军事基地最集中的地方，是在西德（二十四个基地）、日本（十九个基地）和英国（十八个）。同时，美国把其有限的部队分散到这些基地上，约有三十五万在欧洲，二十万左右在远东，一万五千在北非，二万多在加勒比海地区。苏联红色卫星上天，国际形势发生了东风压倒西风的巨大变化以后，美国侵略世界的战略地位一落千丈。美国又急忙在各地策划建立导弹基地网。美国已同英国签订了导弹基地协定。意大利也已同意在自己领土上建立美国导弹基地。美国正在施加压力，强迫法国和北大西洋集团其他成员国接受建立美国导弹基地。在中东和远东，美国也在加紧进行着这种活动。
          巧取豪夺
    美国统治集团采取各种卑鄙和恶毒的手段，在各国领土上建立和扩充美国军事基地。美国建立基地网的过程就是对各国独立和领土主权巧取豪夺的侵略过程。在第二次大战时期，美国就开始利用他国处境的困难，夺取军事基地。例如，1940年秋，英国由于受到纳粹德国潜水艇的海盗袭击，商船损失很大，处境非常困难。于是美国就利用这一情况，迫使英国同意把大西洋西部的基地租让给美国九十九年，而英国所得到的代价仅仅是五十艘旧驱逐舰。与此同时，美国借口“抵御”希特勒德国和日本的侵略，径自把自己的军队开到别的国家去建立基地，而当战争结束之后，仍然赖着不走。冰岛就是这样的例子。美国军队在1941年开进了这个国家。当时，美国总统罗斯福还曾保证：一俟战争结束，美国军队将立即撤走。可是现在战争结束已十又三年，冰岛政府也曾正式要求美军撤出，但美国军队依然死死地占着冰岛的基地不放。
    美国对于西德、日本战败国，那更是肆无忌惮了。从开始占领之日起，美国就擅自动手大规模地建筑军事设施。在美国的全球基地网里，设在日本和西德的基地数目最多，规模也最大。
    美国还用“美援”骗取基地。这是美国最常用的一种方法。美国给予某些国家一些武器或美元，结果也就使这些国家的许多重要地区和港口变成了美国的军事基地。1948年希腊接受“马歇尔计划”的“援助”之后，又同美国签订了军事协定，使美国得以在希腊建立军事基地。美国对其他国家也广泛地利用了这种骗人把戏，来侵占军事基地。
    拼凑军事侵略集团，也是美国夺取国外基地的重要手法。无论是北大西洋集团、巴格达条约集团、东南亚条约组织都给美国建立基地开了方便之门。仅在北大西洋集团国家，美国的基地就有好几十个，而且这些基地还由所在国的政府负担建筑费用。
    美国就是利用了这些政治、经济和军事的欺骗和压力手段强占了别国的领土作为自己的军事基地。
        散布死亡种子
    美国在国外夺取军事基地时，总是打着所谓“防御共产主义侵略”的招牌。这是彻头彻尾的谎言。美国的统治者和将军们早已毫不隐瞒它们在国外建立军事基地是准备“给俄国的腹地以打击”。而几年来的事实也已证明：美国把它在国外的基地当作进攻和侵略社会主义国家和民族独立国家的据点。1950年美国就是利用南朝鲜和日本的军事基地发动了侵朝战争。今年年初印度尼西亚发生叛乱，美国又利用菲律宾的基地为印度尼西亚叛乱分子提供武器。而不久前美国军队对黎巴嫩的武装侵略和在台湾海峡对我国进行的军事挑衅，也都是利用它在西德、土耳其、菲律宾和台湾的军事基地作为它运送武器和侵略军队的跳板。在这种情况下，那些在国土上设有美国军事基地，特别是导弹基地的国家的人民就面临着极为严重的危险。因为他们随时随刻可能被美国拉入一场违反他们愿望的侵略战争中去，这除了使这些国家有可能遭受毁灭性灾难之外，没有任何别的好处。
        侵犯独立主权
    美国在国外建立军事基地时，经常打起所谓“保障小国安全”的幌子。但是实际上却是对这些国家领土主权的最粗暴的侵犯。例如，美国在菲律宾的基地的管辖权力，已远远超出飞机场或港湾设备的范围，甚至像一个市或一个县那样大的行政区也整个地被划在美国驻军司令的统辖之下。美国是根据法美协定在摩洛哥设立军事基地的，但摩洛哥获得独立并要求美国交还基地时，美国竟然拒绝。1956年冰岛议会通过要求美军撤出冰岛的决议时，杜勒斯更公然宣称：冰岛议会的决议“在国际上没有实施的效力”。请看，美国对别的国家的主权究竟蔑视到何种程度。除此之外，美国驻军还凭借治外法权、免除关税等等特权，进行走私，为非作歹，造成无数的犯罪案件。从1953年10月到1958年6月，仅仅在日本一个国家的犯罪案即达三万三千多起。
  但是更严重的是：目前随着美国导弹基地的建立，各国这种丧失主权的情况更到了危险的程度。因为根据协定，只有美国有权决定是否使用核导弹，而设有导弹基地的国家对此反而没有发言权。这就等于把这些国家的命运完全交给美国侵略者。
        到处受到反对
    由于美国建立军事基地给各国带来如此深重的损害和威胁，不可避免地要使它陷在各国人民的反对中。各国人民反对美国军事基地的斗争，正在日益高涨起来。
    西欧各国人民长期来反对美国军事基地的斗争，正集中火力来阻止美国建立导弹基地。去年英、法、西德、意大利等九个西欧国家的和平运动代表率先在巴黎举行集会，向参加北大西洋集团的各国的人民呼吁反对美国的导弹基地计划。美英导弹基地协定签订后，今年3月1日，英国开展了“全国抗议美国占领日”的运动。在苏格兰的格拉斯哥市举行了十年来最盛大的政治集会，抗议美国在这个市建立导弹基地。本月6、7日英格兰东部诺福克人民也连续两天举行大示威，反对在当地建筑美国导弹基地。在西德，据不久前民意测验，有83％的西德居民反对美国在西德设立导弹基地。法国人民要求戴高乐应该根本拒绝美国在法国设立导弹基地，而不只是在进行讨价还价。丹麦和挪威政府一直拒绝了美国设立导弹基地的要求。
    在希腊，人民反对建立美军导弹基地的意志，在今年5月的大选中表现得极为明显。选举结果，主张建立美国导弹基地的国民激进联盟遭到了严重的失败，将近60％的选民投票反对它；而反对建立美军基地的统一民主左翼党则取得了巨大的胜利。
    日本人民反对基地斗争的烈火烧得最旺。今年4月召开的日本全国反对军事基地联络会议的全国代表会议，以及不久前在东京举行的
  “阻止核武装日本和拥护民主中央大会”，充分表现了日本人民反对美国把日本变成核战争基地的坚强意志。两次大会的决议都要求美军撤出日本，并号召人民为此而斗争到底。目前日本人民反对基地的斗争正和反对美日反动派建立新的军事同盟体制及要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争密切结合起来。
    在冲绳，人民曾经和美国企图撵走坚决要取消美国占领的那霸市市长濑长的阴谋进行了长期的不屈的斗争。当美国用威胁高压手段迫使濑长去职之后，斗争并没有被阻止，冲绳人民又选举了同样反对美军占领的兼次佐一为那霸市市长，而支持兼次的进步力量又在冲绳市议会补充选举中获得胜利。今年5月，冲绳各市、镇、村的议会根据全体会议的决议，向美国政府提出书面要求，反对美国把核武器运进冲绳。
      “美国佬，滚回去”
    在亚洲其他地区，甚至在美国军事、经济、政治控制下的菲律宾，由于人民的压力，菲律宾政府在1956年秋天就同美国举行了修改基地协定的谈判。在美国中断谈判后的两年多来，菲律宾各阶层人民反对美国基地的斗争仍在继续中。
    “美国佬，滚回去！”这句响亮的口号，在非洲的土地上也响起来了。在摩洛哥，美国无视摩洛哥主权而擅自建立原子轰炸机基地的行动激怒了摩洛哥人民，广大劳动人民、政治领袖和报纸舆论同声斥责美国的无理行为。一个要求撤销美国军事基地的运动已席卷全摩洛哥。今年7月摩洛哥国民议会曾一致通过决议，要求“一切外国军队撤出摩洛哥”。
        靶子和孤岛
    杜勒斯还自欺欺人地叫喊说：“这种基地大大增加了我们的威慑力量的效力。”这完全是狂人的幻想。在今天社会主义阵营力量空前强大的时候，美国的军事基地，无论是导弹基地或者是战略核轰炸机基地，都无法改变这样一个基本事实，即像法国出席联合国裁军小组委员会代表莫克曾经说的：由于苏联拥有了洲际导弹，今天美国已处在能受到攻击的“第一线”的地位。其次，美国在国外的军事基地可以威胁别人，但它到处暴露的基地也成了别人反击的目标。赫鲁晓夫同志说得好，他说：
  “如果美国军事基地离苏联边境很近，那末也可以反过来说，就是苏联离这些基地不远。因此，如果侵略者一旦发动战争，那末苏联拥有已经试验好的完善的武器不仅可以消灭这些基地，而且可以给更远的目标以毁灭性的反击。”不仅如此，事实上，美国依靠军事基地而制定的战略政策，也存在着它本身的致命弱点，那就是：战线漫长，兵力分散。美国兵力有限，而它在世界各地的基地，有的离开美国六千公里，更远的有一万公里以上，而且散布极广。如果美国发动世界大战，要保住这些基地，并进行军事供应，都大成问题。美国军事基地政策的这种弱点，在今年美国武装侵略中东和在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅中，就明显地暴露出来。美国出兵黎巴嫩时，不得不从欧洲和其他地区抽调部队，在台湾海峡地区向我挑衅时又只好从各地调集军队。仅仅在这两个地方，美国就如此顾此失彼，疲于奔命，如果它同时在几条、几十条乃至几百条战线上作战，那它就更加难于应付了。因此，正像世界广大舆论所指出的，当前形势下，美国的军事基地，已成为导弹轰击的“靶子”，成为四面受敌和包围的
  “孤岛”。即使不在战争时期，美国要赖在基地不走，也是不行的。随着人民反对浪潮的不断高涨，美国的基地愈来愈有被海浪吞没的危险。伊拉克革命的胜利，就把美国和其他帝国主义在中东的一个被视为顽固的堡垒粉碎了。
    美国建立全球性军事基地网，为的是用来反对社会主义国家，反对民族独立国家，威胁各国人民。但是事情的发展走到了美帝国主义者的愿望的反面。美国的军事基地帮助各国人民看清了美国侵略者的凶恶的面目，动员了更多的人起来反对它，使美国陷于全世界人民的反对之中。军事基地的锁链变成了套在它脖子上的无数条绞索。（附图片）
