Not "Forever Need Pure Mental Laborers"
    Wang Ruojun

    I disagree with Wei Gao's opinion that "pure mental laborers are forever needed." Now I'll share my views.

    Wei Gao admits that "the cause of inequality between mental and physical labor is class," yet he also says that in communist society, pure mental laborers and physical laborers will still exist. This is logically inconsistent. The statement that class causes the inequality between mental and physical labor is, in a sense, correct. The division of mental and physical labor arose due to very low levels of productivity, but the social phenomenon of a portion of people becoming mental laborers and separating from physical labor was, from the beginning, supported and maintained by historically reactionary classes, and used to serve the interests of their own class, maximizing this inequality. Therefore, unless classes are eliminated, the inequality between mental and physical labor will not be eliminated. But in communist society, everyone knows that classes are to be eliminated, and due to the high development of social productivity, products will become greatly abundant, sufficient to provide everyone with ample and equal opportunities and conditions for education. At this time, what social force would need to preserve this inequality between pure mental labor and pure physical labor? None! Since this is the case, which class (social force) would this inequality rely on to continue to exist? Therefore, it is clearly self-contradictory to say on one hand that the cause of the inequality between mental and physical labor is class, and on the other hand to say that a communist society that has eliminated classes still needs this inequality.

    Wei Gao believes that there should still be a division of physical and mental labor in communist society. Yes, people in communist society will of course engage in different social occupations, but this social division of labor and the difference between physical and mental labor are two different things; it does not predetermine that the difference between mental and physical labor must be preserved. Moreover, the division of labor in communist society is completely different from the social consequences caused by the division of labor under capitalist conditions; it will not cause people to develop in a deformed way, but will allow everyone to specialize in their own field while also being proficient in other fields.

    In a perfect communist society, there may be professional writers, but it seems that there will be even more amateur writers. Because social products are so abundant and people's education is so profound, it will not be rare for "laborers" to engage in some creative writing after running machines. Moreover, it is conceivable that the lifeblood and spirit of the times in their works will be no less inferior than those of professional writers. There may be professional designers. However, if these designers want to make their designs adapt to the requirements of production to the greatest extent, what harm is there in participating in some actual production operations for their design ideas and techniques? Atomic energy experts are indispensable in this society. However, it can also be said that "laborers" are all experts in this field. Because this energy is so widely used in material production and daily life, and "laborers" have superb cultural and scientific knowledge, why must we consult those so-called experts who do not participate in actual production, sit high in an ivory tower, and fabricate theories out of thin air, whether to solve practical or theoretical problems in this area? It can be said without exaggeration that in communist society, everyone can be a writer, designer, agricultural expert, or atomic energy expert, and everyone is also a participant in actual production, that is, a physical laborer. And these physical laborers each have a specialty in a certain period of time. Therefore, there is no need to ask sewing workers to solve civil engineering problems, nor is there a need to ask barbers to solve theoretical physics problems, but this is only because it is temporarily unnecessary in their work, and it is absolutely not because they are born with bones that are only fit for pure physical labor, without the intellectual level and social conditions to study and master these problems.

    Another argument Wei Gao puts forward for why there should still be a division of physical and mental labor in communist society is: "In order to give greater play to people's role."

    Is that really the case? We might as well think about whether preserving the opposition or difference between mental and physical labor is more conducive to "giving greater play to people's role" in communist society, or whether eliminating this opposition or difference is more conducive to "giving greater play to people's role." In the process of human social development, several major social divisions of labor have indeed promoted social progress. But the division of mental and physical labor, developed to the current stage of capitalism, is not good. This cannot but be a major reason why the United States is lagging behind the Soviet Union in science and technology. In terms of the level of social productivity in the United States alone, it is possible to take a step forward towards eliminating this opposition, but the decadent relations of production determine that it is fundamentally impossible to change. On the contrary, this opposition is becoming more and more serious, and the social consequences caused by it have long been seen by everyone. The remarkable development of science and technology in the Soviet Union is largely due to the Soviet Party and government's consistent struggle to gradually eliminate this difference. The recent opinions of the CPSU Central Committee on reforming the education system are an example of another major step forward in this regard. The Soviet example can fully prove that the more this difference is eliminated, the more it can "give greater play to people's role."

    Wei Gao also said that "laborers who are directly engaged in the production of material materials do not need to master too much theory." Such a view is even more unacceptable to us. What harm is there in giving theoretical knowledge to those farmers who create wheat yields of seven thousand catties per mu, or to those workers who dare to challenge traditional "authorities"? They are already so "daring" without mastering "excessive" theory, what would happen once they master "excessive" theory? Some people have probably already sensed that it would make those "pure mental laborers", false authorities, and false experts even more ashamed, but I don't understand what harm there is in this. The remaining question is whether these physical laborers who lack "genius" have the ability to master these theories. There is a famous saying that goes, "Genius is diligence." Diligent "laborers" can seize material wealth from nature, and they will certainly subdue the spiritual wealth that was originally created for them.

    At present, the Party is calling on us intellectuals to become workers and peasants, and for workers and peasants to become intellectualized. Schools are vigorously running factories and farms, and factories and communes are also vigorously running schools, eliminating illiteracy, and popularizing education. This is precisely the first step towards the broad road of combining mental and physical labor, and the prospects are infinitely bright. The road was originally straight, but it seems that not everyone is willing to walk the straight path, and ideological struggle is inevitable. We support the Party's education policy, welcome the all-round development of people and the genuine liberation of people's personalities, and oppose erroneous views that violate the direction of social development and deviate from the Party's policy.

### 不“永远需要单纯的脑力劳动者”

    不“永远需要单纯的脑力劳动者”
    王若军
    我不同意魏高“永远需要单纯的脑力劳动者”的意见。现在谈谈我的看法。
    魏高承认“造成脑力劳动与体力劳动不平等的原因是阶级”，却又说到了共产主义社会，单纯的脑力劳动者和体力劳动者仍然存在。这在逻辑上先说不通。阶级造成了脑力劳动和体力劳动的不平等，这句话在某种意义上是对的。脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工，是由于生产力水平很低而出现的，但一部分人作为脑力劳动者而脱离体力劳动这一社会现象，一开始就受到历史上反动阶级的支持和维护，并用它来服务于本阶级的利益，尽量扩大这种不平等。所以阶级不消灭，脑力劳动与体力劳动的不平等就不会消灭。可是在共产主义社会，谁都知道阶级是要消灭了的，由于社会生产力的高度发展，产品要大大丰富起来，足以使人人获得充裕的、平等的受教育的机会和条件；这时，还有哪一个社会力量需要保存这种单纯脑力劳动和单纯体力劳动的不平等现象呢？没有！既然如此，这种不平等现象凭借着哪个阶级（社会力量）继续存在下去呢？因此，一面说脑力劳动与体力劳动的不平等现象的原因是阶级，一面又说消灭了阶级的共产主义社会仍然需要这种不平等，显然是自相矛盾。
    魏高认为，到共产主义社会仍应有体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工。是的，共产主义社会人们当然也要从事不同的社会职业，可是，这种社会分工和体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别是两回事，它并不注定脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别要保存下来。并且，共产主义社会的职业分工，跟资本主义条件下的两种劳动的分工所造成的社会后果完全不同，它不会使人们畸形发展，而是人人专于本行，又兼通其它的行业。
    在完备的共产主义社会，职业作家也许会有的，但是，想来会更多的出现业余作家。因为社会产品是如此丰足，人们的教养是如此博深，“劳动者”在开过机器之余，从事一点创作不会是希罕事，而且可以想像得出，他们作品中的生活气息、时代精神，决不会比职业作家逊色多少。职业设计师也许会有的。但是，如果这些设计师想使他的设计最大限度的适应生产的要求，那么，参加一些实际生产操作，对他的设计思想和技术又有什么害处呢？原子能专家在这个社会里当然少不了。但是，也可以说，“劳动者”都是这一行的专家。因为这种能量是如此广泛的被应用于物质生产和日常生活之中，“劳动者”又都有高超的文化科学知识，那么，不论解决这方面的实际问题或理论问题，为什么一定要去请教那些不参加实际生产、高卧于象牙之塔、面壁虚构的所谓专家呢？可以毫不夸张地说，在共产主义社会里，人人都可以作文学家、设计师、农艺专家、原子能专家，人人又是实际生产的参加者，即体力劳动者。而这些体力劳动者在一定的时间里又各有专业。因此，也就没有必要叫缝纫工人去解决土木建筑上的问题，也没有必要叫理发师去解决理论物理上的问题，但是这仅仅是由于工作上的暂时不需要，绝对不是因为他生就了只配作单纯体力劳动的骨头，而没有研究、精通这些问题的智力水平和社会条件。
    魏高提出共产主义社会仍应该有体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工的另一论据是：“为了发挥人们更大的作用”。
    果真是如此吗？我们不妨想一想，在共产主义社会，究竟是保存脑力劳动与体力劳动的对立或差别有利于“发挥人的更大作用”？还是消灭这种对立或差别有利于“发挥人的更大作用”？在人类社会发展的进程中，几次社会大分工的确推动了社会进步。但是脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工，发展到资本主义当前阶段这个地步，可就不妙了。这不能不是美国在科学技术方面落后于苏联的一大原因。单就美国的社会生产力水平来说，是可以向消灭这个对立的道路前进一步的，但是腐朽的生产关系，决定了它根本不可能有所改变，相反地，这种对立越来越厉害，因此引起的社会后果是大家早已看到了的。苏联的科学技术的长足发展，很重要的原因是苏联党和政府一贯地为逐步消灭这个差别而斗争。最近苏共中央的关于改革教育制度的意见，就是在这方面又向前迈出一大步的例证。苏联的例子可以充分证明，越是消灭这个差别，越能“发挥人的更大作用”。
    魏高还说，“直接从事物质资料生产的劳动者，没有必要掌握太多的理论”。这样的观点更是我们完全不能接受的。把理论知识交给那些创造亩产小麦七千斤的农民，交给那些敢于跟传统“权威”挑战的工人有什么坏处呢？他们没有掌握“过多的”理论就已经这样“胆大包天”，一旦掌握了“过多的”理论会怎么样呢？大概有人已经预感到了，那会使那些“单纯的脑力劳动者”、假权威、假专家更加汗颜，可是，我不明白这有什么坏处。剩下的问题是，这些缺乏“天才”的体力劳动者有没有能力掌握这些理论。有句名言说得好：“天才就是勤奋”，勤奋的“劳动者”能从大自然中夺取物质财富，也就一定会驯服那本来为他所创造的精神财富。
    目前，党号召我们知识分子工农化，工农分子知识化，学校正在大办工厂和农场，工厂、公社也正在大办学校，扫除文盲、普及教育，这正是朝着脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合这条康庄大道迈出的第一步，前景是无限美好的。道路本来是笔直的，可是，看来不是所有的人都愿走直道，思想斗争是不可免的。我们拥护党的教育方针，欢迎人的全面发展和使人们得到名副其实的个性解放，反对违反社会发展方向和背离党的方针的错误主张。
