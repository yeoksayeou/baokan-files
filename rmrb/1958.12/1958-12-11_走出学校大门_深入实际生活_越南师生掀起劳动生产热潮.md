Stepping Out of School Gates, Deep Into Real Life
Vietnamese Teachers and Students Set Off a Surge of Labor Production

(Reported by this newspaper) Since the beginning of the 1958-1959 academic year, a surge of teachers and students participating in production labor has rapidly formed throughout the entire education system of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Teachers and students at all levels of schools have stepped out of the school gates to participate in production labor and learn production knowledge in real life, so as to better combine learning with production.

In addition to regularly participating in various voluntary labor activities, teachers and students of Vietnamese universities also participate in labor in factories or rural areas in combination with their respective majors. Recently, students from the Agronomy Department and the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department of Vietnam Agricultural and Forestry University just finished their production labor in rural areas of Ha Dong Province. During a month of labor, they not only actively participated in sowing, fertilizer accumulation and other work, and learned a lot of practical production knowledge, but also helped farmers carry out livestock epidemic prevention work. More than 1,000 teachers and students from the Medical University also recently set off to participate in two months of production labor in the countryside, and plan to combine their professional skills to carry out health and disease prevention work during labor.

In various general schools in Vietnam, many schools have formulated specific plans for planting crops and helping local working people with plowing, transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting, and other production labor. Some schools have planted experimental fields and also manufactured various agricultural tools to support farmers' production, achieving very good results. Even schools in cities have established contacts with nearby farmers and often go to help them with labor.

Due to the active participation of teachers and students in production labor, a new atmosphere has emerged in schools at all levels in Vietnam in the past few months. Teachers and students have not only learned a lot of practical production knowledge, but also greatly improved their ideological awareness and strengthened their determination to fight for the cause of socialist construction by contacting the broad masses of working people.

    走出学校大门  深入实际生活
    越南师生掀起劳动生产热潮
    本报讯  自1958—1959学年开始以来，在越南民主共和国的整个教育系统中已经迅速地形成了一个教师与学生参加生产劳动的热潮。各级学校的师生纷纷走出学校大门，到实际生活中去参加生产劳动和学习生产知识，使学习与生产更好地结合起来，
    越南各大学的师生除经常参加各种义务劳动外，还结合各自的专业到工厂或农村参加劳动。最近期间，越南农林大学农艺系和畜牧兽医系的学生刚刚结束了他们在河东省农村的生产劳动。在为时一个月的劳动中，他们不仅积极地参加了播种、积肥等工作，学习了许多实际的生产知识，并且还帮助农民开展了牲畜的防疫工作。医药大学一千多师生也在最近出发到农村参加为时两个月的生产劳动，并计划在劳动中结合自己的专业进行卫生和防治疾病的工作。
    在越南的各级普通学校中，许多学校已经制订了种植农作物和帮助当地劳动人民进行翻地、插秧和收获等生产劳动的具体计划。有些学校种植了试验田，还制造各种农具支援农民生产，获得了很好的成绩。就是城市中的学校也同附近的农民建立了联系，经常去帮助农民劳动。
    由于教师和学生积极地参加了生产劳动，几个月来，越南各级学校已经出现了一种新气象。教师和学生们不仅学到了许多实际的生产知识，并且由于与广大劳动人民接触而大大地提高了思想觉悟水平，坚定了为社会主义建设事业奋斗的决心。
