Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a report on industrial and transportation issues at the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Socialist Agricultural Construction on the afternoon of the 29th.

    The report first pointed out that the Great Leap Forward of 1958 began first on the agricultural front. The achievements made on the agricultural front are a great encouragement to the tens of millions of workers on the industrial and transportation fronts. At the same time, the achievements on the agricultural front and the direct involvement of tens of millions of peasant brothers in running industry and transportation have strongly supported the development of the industrial and transportation sectors, greatly promoting the rapid arrival of the high tide in the industrial and transportation sectors. He said: Here, I, together with the vast number of workers and comrades on the industrial and transportation fronts, express our heartfelt respect, warm congratulations, and cordial greetings to you - the advanced figures on the national agricultural front and in the patriotic health campaign, and through you to the five hundred million peasant brothers.

    Next, Comrade Bo Yibo introduced the situation on the industrial and transportation fronts this year and next year. He said: In 1958, China's socialist industrialization cause achieved a great victory at a high speed far exceeding any previous year. According to current estimates, industrial production in 1958 increased by more than 60% compared to 1957. Among the main industrial products, steel increased by more than double, machine tools increased by more than triple, and coal increased by more than double. With the rapid development of heavy industry, light industry has also greatly increased. Cotton yarn increased by 43%. Transportation, postal and telecommunications have also greatly developed. The leap forward of China's industry, agriculture, and other undertakings in 1958, and the leap forward of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, formed a sharp contrast with the economic crisis in the Western world.

    He pointed out: The tremendous victory China achieved on the industrial front in 1958 is fundamentally due to our conscientious implementation of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. The practice of the past year has further proved the complete correctness of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs." The "walking on two legs" policy is: simultaneously developing industry and agriculture on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, simultaneously using foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, and combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements. This entire set of policies correctly reflects China's actual conditions and the requirements of objective economic laws, and therefore they have shown strong vitality in practice.

    On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the development of China's industry in 1959 will achieve an even more ambitious goal. According to the 1959 planned targets proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, China's industrial production will continue to develop at roughly the same speed as in 1958, while the absolute amount of increase in most industrial products will be much larger than in 1958. Here, Comrade Bo Yibo emphasized: The 1959 industrial development plan is still a Great Leap Forward plan, a greater, faster, better, and more economical plan, and a plan of decisive significance during the three years of hard work. According to the 1959 planned targets, China will produce 18 million tons of steel. This figure is equal to twenty times the highest annual output in old China. Isn't this a Great Leap Forward? This leap forward plan is entirely possible to achieve because the planned targets fully estimate the objective possibilities. Taking steel production capacity as an example, by the end of 1959, the capacity of large and medium-sized steel plants alone will reach about 22 million tons. The production targets of other heavy industry sectors, especially the relationship between electricity, transportation capacity, and various production sectors, have also been appropriately arranged according to the requirements of planned and proportional development. At the same time, taking into account the growing needs of the people's livelihood and the great agricultural harvest in 1958, considerable attention has also been given to light industrial production.

    Next, Comrade Bo Yibo said: Of course, achieving the 1959 industrial Great Leap Forward plan is by no means an easy task, and we may encounter many difficulties. We must despise difficulties strategically, continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, advocate daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and go all out, aim high. At the same time, we must emphasize difficulties tactically, earnestly advocate practical, arduous, and skillful work, advocate "ten-point targets and twelve-point measures," advocate practical calculation, arrangement, and inspection, oppose exaggeration, and oppose concealing shortcomings. Economic work must be done more and more meticulously and must be as close to reality or conform to reality as possible. Here, he gave detailed explanations on the issues of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, the relationship between objective conditions and subjective initiative, the combination of centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements, the combination of highlighting key points and overall arrangement, and the issues of active balance and passive balance in achieving the 1959 industrial plan.

    Finally, Comrade Bo Yibo said: In addition to the great working class, the basic force for developing China's industry also includes the great ally of the working class - the 500 million peasants. China's peasants are not ordinary peasants, but peasants who have undergone two great revolutions, the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, under the leadership of the working class, peasants who have already realized the people's commune system and are highly organized, and peasants who have already made and will continue to make greater contributions to China's socialist industrialization cause. China's peasants not only supply industry with grain and raw materials for light industry, providing China's industry with the world's largest domestic market, but also provide industry with a large amount of raw materials for heavy industry. The reason why China's basic raw material industry was able to develop at a high speed in 1958, for example, the ore needed for steel production increased by tens of millions of tons, and coal increased by more than 100 million tons, many of these raw materials were mined by peasants. From this, people can clearly see that in order to make China's industry develop at a high speed, in addition to relying on the strength of the working class, it is also necessary to rely on the strength of more than 500 million peasants. In 1959, the broad masses of peasant brothers, on the one hand, must strive for an even greater harvest than this year on the agricultural front to support the country's industrialization; on the other hand, they must implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing self-sufficiency production and commodity production, and accelerate the industrialization of communes. The industrialization of the country and the industrialization of communes are of extremely great significance for the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and for completely changing the face of China's entire agriculture. Let us, on the industrial and agricultural fronts, follow the victorious road of 1958, achieve abundant production again and again, leap forward again and again, and strive to promote the common high tide of industry and agriculture in 1959, and to accelerate the construction of our great motherland into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    农民也是发展工业的基本力量
    国务院副总理薄一波向全国农业先进单位代表作报告
    新华社29日讯  中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波，29日下午在全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议上，作了关于工业与交通问题的报告。
    报告首先指出：1958年的大跃进，是在农业战线上首先开始的。农业战线上所取得的成就，对于工业和交通战线上的几千万职工，是很大的鼓舞；同时，农业战线上的成就和几千万农民兄弟直接动手办工业、办交通事业，都有力地支援了工业和交通部门的发展，大大促进了工业交通部门的高潮的迅速到来。他说：在这里，我和工业、交通战线上的广大职工同志们一起，向你们——全国农业战线上的，和除四害、讲卫生运动中的先进人物，并通过你们向五亿农民弟兄，表示衷心的敬意，热烈的祝贺和亲切的问候。
    接着，薄一波同志介绍了今年和明年工业和交通战线上的情况。他说：1958年我国社会主义工业化事业，以远远超过以往任何一年的高速度，得到了伟大的胜利。根据现在的预计，1958年比1957年，工业生产增长60％以上。主要工业产品中，钢增长一倍以上，机床增长两倍以上，煤炭增长一倍以上。随着重工业的迅速发展，轻工业也有很大的增长。棉纱增长43％。交通运输、邮电事业也有很大的发展。1958年我国工业和农业以及其它各项事业的跃进，苏联和其他社会主义国家的跃进，同西方世界的经济危机形成了鲜明的对照。
    他指出：1958年我国在工业战线上取得巨大的胜利，归根到底是由于我们认真地执行了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线。一年来的实践，进一步地证明了党的用“两条腿走路”的方针的完全正确。“两条腿走路”的方针，就是：在优先发展重工业的基础上工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举，以钢为纲、全面跃进，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举，以及集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合。这一整套方针，正确地反映了我国的实际情况和客观经济规律的要求，因而它们在实践中显示出强大的生命力。
    在1958年大跃进的基础上1959年我国工业的发展将实现一个更加宏伟的目标。按照党的八届六中全会提出的1959年计划指标，我国工业的生产将继续保持同1958年大体相同的速度向前发展，而大多数工业产品增加的绝对数量，则将比1958年大得多。在这里，薄一波同志强调指出：1959年的工业发展计划，仍然是一个大跃进的计划，是一个多快好省的计划，是苦战三年期间一个带有决定意义的计划。按1959年计划指标，我国将生产一千八百万吨钢。这个数字等于旧中国最高年产量的二十倍。这不是大跃进又是什么呢？这个跃进计划是完全有可能实现的。因为计划指标充分地估计了客观可能性。以钢的生产能力为例，截至1959年底，只是大型和中型钢铁厂的能力，就将达到二千二百万吨左右。其他重工业部门的生产指标，特别是电力、运输力和各生产部门之间的关系，也都根据有计划按比例的要求，作了适当安排。同时考虑到人民生活的日益增长的需要，和1958年农业的大丰收，对于轻工业生产也给了相当的注意。
    接着，薄一波同志说：当然，要实现1959年的工业大跃进计划，决不是轻而易举的事情，也可能遇到很多困难。我们一定要在战略上藐视困难，继续反对保守，破除迷信，提倡敢想敢说敢做，鼓足干劲，力争上游。与此同时，我们一定又要在战术上重视困难，认真提倡实干苦干巧干，提倡“十分指标、十二分措施”，提倡切实的计算，安排和检查，反对浮夸，反对隐瞒缺点。经济工作一定要愈做愈细致，一定要尽可能地接近实际或者符合实际。在这里，他对于实现1959年工业计划中，关于解放思想和实事求是的问题、客观条件和主观能动作用的关系问题、集中领导和大搞群众运动的结合问题、重点突出和全面安排的结合问题、积极平衡和消极平衡的问题，都作了详细的说明。
    最后，薄一波同志说：发展我国工业的基本力量，除了伟大的工人阶级以外，还有工人阶级的伟大同盟军——五亿农民。我国的农民，不是一般的农民，而是在工人阶级领导下进行过民主革命和社会主义革命两次大革命的农民，是已经实现了人民公社化的、高度组织了起来的农民，是对我国的社会主义工业化事业已经做出、而且还将继续做出更大功绩的农民。我国的农民，不仅是用粮食和轻工业原料供应工业，给我国工业提供了世界上最广大的国内市场，而且还给工业提供了大量的重工业原料。我国的基本原料工业1958年所以能够高速度地向前发展，例如，生产钢铁需要的矿石一增加就是几千万吨，煤炭一增加就是一亿多吨，这些原料其中很多就是靠农民来采掘的。从这里人们可以清楚地看见，要使我国工业高速度发展，除了依靠工人阶级的力量以外，还必须依靠五亿多农民的力量。在1959年，广大的农民兄弟，一方面要在农业战线上争取比今年更大的丰收，支援国家的工业化；另一方面，要实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，加速公社的工业化。国家的工业化、公社的工业化对于农业的机械化、电气化，对于彻底改变我国整个农业的面貌有着极其重大的意义。让我们在工业战线上和农业战线上，沿着1958年胜利的道路，丰产再丰产，跃进再跃进，为促进1959年的工农业共同高涨，为加速把我们伟大祖国建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家而奋斗。
