    Goodbye! Dear Hometown
    Ma Hongfen, Cadre Transferred Downward by the Ministry of Public Security
    Two months ago, I left Baoguantun, Nanpi County, Hebei Province, for work. Now, I am about to return here, and an unspeakable joy surges into my heart. But then I think, I have to leave again tomorrow, and feelings of reluctance and attachment well up.
    As soon as I entered the house, my aunt hurriedly ran out. She grabbed my backpack, pulled me into the house, and said with affection, "You must be exhausted! Take a rest." Before I could answer, she was busy pouring water for me, letting me wash my face, and then busy making my bed and tidying up the house... Seeing my aunt sweating profusely, I quickly tried to dissuade her, "Aunt! I'm only staying at our house for one night..." I worried that she would be too sad, so I swallowed the rest of the sentence.
    Sister Junying came back and, upon seeing me, jumped and hugged me, saying, "Sister, you're back! You're not leaving this time, are you!" Before I could answer, my aunt instructed her, "Hurry to the cafeteria and get some sweet potato porridge. Hongfen can't get it in the county. She's home today, so let her eat something she likes!" Junying agreed and ran off with a basin. My aunt took out a small basket from the cabinet, inside which was a red-flowered towel. She gently uncovered the towel and put a piece of golden yellow mooncake in my hand, patting my shoulder, as if to a child, and said, "Eat it! I saved this for you from the Mid-Autumn Festival." My uncle came back from outside, holding a green, crispy cucumber. I thought: it’s getting cold and there’s almost frost, where did this cucumber come from? My uncle smiled and handed it to me: "This was grown in our backyard. Only one was left, and no one was willing to pick it. It was saved for you. Eat it quickly!" I took the mooncake and the cucumber, unable to say a word, and from this mooncake and cucumber, I felt the fiery hearts of my aunt and uncle.
    After dinner, my aunt rubbed her eyes and said in a low voice, "You might as well not have come. You just came and are leaving again, how can people bear it!" My sister Junying, who was usually so mischievous, seemed to have lost her energy and asked me with tears in her eyes, "When can you come again?" Finally, my uncle said helplessly, "It's for work! Just don't forget this family, write often, and if you can get away from work, come home to visit!"
    It was late at night, and I slept on the comfortable bed that my aunt had prepared for me, feeling as warm as if I were lying in the arms of a loving mother. The light in the outer room was still on. I opened the curtain and saw my aunt and Junying working with their heads down under the dim light, looking as anxious as if they were rushing to make a dowry for their own relative. I put on my clothes and ran over to take a look. It turned out that she was making a newly cleaned quilt for me. I opened my mouth, unable to utter a word of gratitude, and just leaned on her shoulder and said:
  "Aunt! It's the middle of the night, go to sleep! Don't bother for me!" My aunt didn't say anything, just kept sewing. After a while, she finally sighed and said, "Child! This is the only time Aunt can do this for you!" My aunt's tears welled up in her eyes.
    My aunt is a "model worker" in the village. She is strong, capable, and always cares for and takes care of others, treating me like her own children. When I first arrived, she was worried about me carrying the clay on the team, so she never let me carry it with others. Every time, she carried it with me herself. When carrying it, she always pulled the soil basket to her side. When I insisted on sharing the load equally with her, she always pretended to be angry and said, "What, are you disobeying orders?"
    When I went to the township for a meeting at night, she always brought clothes and a flashlight to pick me up. Once, the meeting ended at two o'clock in the morning. As soon as I came out of the room, I heard someone calling me, "Hongfen, the meeting is over, let's go home!" I looked and saw that it was my aunt waiting for me with a flashlight and cotton coat. The secretary of the township Party committee told me that she had come to pick me up as soon as it got dark.
    My aunt is the director of the Women's Federation. In addition to working in the fields every day, she often has meetings at night and also has to do housework. She doesn't have any free time every day, but she still sews clothes and makes shoes for me. Now, she is busy making a quilt for me. In the fifteen years since my mother passed away, no one has done any needlework for me. Today, it is she, my aunt – a simple, kind peasant woman – who is sewing for me stitch by stitch. In these eight months, I have not only learned many things that cannot be learned from books and transformed my thinking, but I have also regained motherly love.
    The next day, I greeted the dawn and bid farewell to my hometown with reluctance. I was reluctant to get on my bicycle. I wanted to take another look at my uncle, aunt, sister, and the girls who came to see me off. I wanted to step on this land that had nurtured me for eight months a little more. Eight months, an extraordinary eight months! Unforgettable eight months! It passed so quickly, and there were still many things to learn and many things to do. Baoguantun! My new hometown. Here, I picked up a hoe for the first time, carried a carrying pole for the first time, here, I distinguished leeks and wheat for the first time..., here, I realized the greatness of labor and the infinite wisdom of the masses for the first time, here, I learned the most valuable knowledge of my life. I fell in love with the land here, and even more with the people here. I received education and cultivation here. Goodbye! Dear hometown! Dear land! Dear people! I will take the new blood and strength you have given me and work even harder.

    再见吧！亲爱的故乡
    公安部下放干部  马鸿芬
    两个月前，因为工作而离开了河北省南皮县鲍官屯。现在，又要回到这里，一种说不出的喜悦涌上心头。转而一想，明天又要离开了，惜别、依恋的心绪又涌上来了。
    我一进家门，大婶就急急忙忙地跑出来，她抢着接过我的背包，把我拉到屋内，疼我地说：“可累坏了吧！快歇歇”。不等我回答，她又忙着替我倒水，让我洗脸，又忙着为我搭铺、拾掇屋子……。我见大婶忙得满头是汗，忙劝她：“大婶！我只在咱家住一宿，……”我耽心她过分伤心，下半句又咽到肚里。
    俊英妹妹回来了，见到我就连蹦带跳地抱着我说：“姐姐，可回来了！这一回可不走了吧！”没等我回答，大婶就支使她说：“你快到食堂里打点红薯粘粥，鸿芬在县里吃不着，今天来家了，快让她吃点喜欢吃的东西！”俊英答应了一声，拿起盆子就跑了。大婶从柜子里取出一个小篮子，里边放着一个红花的毛巾包，她轻轻地揭开毛巾包，把一块黄油油的月饼塞到我手里，拍着我的肩，像对小孩似地说：“吃吧！这是过中秋节时给你留下的”。大叔从门外回来，手里拿着一个绿油油的脆瓜，我心想：天冷得快霜冻了，那儿得来这脆瓜？大叔微笑着递给我：“这是在咱后院里种的，只留下一个了，谁也舍不得摘，给你留着，快吃了它吧！”我接过了月饼和脆瓜，一句话也说不出，从这月饼和脆瓜上，我体会到大婶、大叔的火热的心。
    吃罢晚饭，大婶揉揉眼，低沉地说：“你还不如不来，刚来了又走，这叫人心里怎么受呀！”俊英妹妹那股调皮的劲儿不知跑到那里去了，噙着眼泪问我：“什么时候能再来呢？”最后，大叔没奈何地说：“工作需要嘛！只是不要忘了咱这个家，常来信，工作如果离得开，就回家来看看！”
    夜深了，我睡在大婶为我收拾得舒适的床铺上，就像躺在慈母的怀抱里一样的温暖。外间屋的灯还没有熄，我揭开门帘一瞅：大婶和俊英低着头，在豆瓣大的灯头下做活，看她那焦急劲就像替自己的亲人赶做嫁妆似的。我披上衣裳跑过去一看，原来她在替我做新拆洗过的被子，我张了张嘴，半句感激的话也吐不出来，只伏在她肩上说：
  “大婶！半夜三更的快睡吧！甭为我忙了！”大婶没吭声，只管缝。过了好一会，她才长吁了一口气说：“孩子！大婶只能替你做这一次啦！”大婶的热泪夺眶而出。
    大婶在村里是个“劳动模范”，她坚强、能干，处处关心人，体贴人，待我就像自己的亲生儿女一样。乍来时，在队上抬湾泥，她不放心，总不让我和别人抬，每次都是亲自和我抬，抬的时候她总把土筐拉到自己那一头，我争着和她平均分担时，她总是装着生气的样子说：“怎么，你不听指挥吗？”
    我晚上去乡里开会，她总是带着衣服和手电去接我，有一次，散会时已是两点钟了，一出屋门，就听见有人喊我：“鸿芬，散会了，咱回家呀！”我一看，原来是大婶拿着手电和棉衣在等着我，乡党委秘书告诉我，她天一黑就来接我了。
    大婶是妇女主任，每天除下地生产外，晚上经常开会，还要做家务活，每天一点空闲时间也没有，可是她还为我缝补衣服、做鞋子，现在她又忙着为我做被子。母亲逝世后的十五年中，没有人给我做过一件针线活，今天，是她，我的大婶——一位淳朴、善良的农妇为我一针一线地缝着。在这八个月中，我不仅学到了许许多多书本上所学不到的东西，改造了我的思想，我还重新得到了母爱。
    第二天，我迎着黎明的曙光，怀着依恋的心情告别了我的家乡。我迟迟地不愿骑上车子，我愿意多看一眼大叔、大婶、妹妹和送我的姑娘们，我想多踏一踏这哺育了我八个月的土地。八个月，不平凡的八个月呀！难忘的八个月呀！它过的是那样快，还有许许多多该学的没学，该做的没做。鲍官屯呀！我的新的故乡。在这里我第一次拿起锄头，挑起扁担，在这里，我第一次分辨出韭菜和麦子……，在这里，我第一次认识到了劳动的伟大和群众智慧的无穷，在这里，我学到了生平最宝贵的知识。我爱上了这里的土地，更爱上了这里的人们，我在这里受到了教育和培养。再见吧！亲爱的家乡！亲爱的土地！亲爱的人们！我将带着你所给予我的新的血液和力量，加倍地工作。
