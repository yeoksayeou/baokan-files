Physical Labor and Mental Labor Are Not Historical Categories
Tang Zhaolian
I believe it is incorrect to regard the level of productive forces and the development of production tools as the root or condition for the existence or disappearance of physical or mental labor. Consequently, it is wrong to say that primitive society only had physical labor and no mental labor, that mental labor only emerged in slave society, and that communist society will be one where "everyone is a mental laborer" and "physical labor will completely disappear." The level of productive forces and the development of production tools are not the root or condition for the existence or disappearance of physical or mental labor. The real root and condition are the struggle between humanity and nature, and the production of material goods in human society. As long as the production of material goods exists, as long as human productive labor exists, the forms of physical labor and mental labor will exist. Neither physical labor nor mental labor belong to historical categories. Only the difference between the two, and the "physical laborer" and "mental laborer" that reflect this difference, are historical categories. Primitive society was a society where physical and mental labor were combined, and there was no such thing as a "physical laborer." Communist society is a society where the difference between physical and mental labor disappears, and there is no such thing as a "mental laborer."

Physical labor and mental labor are mutually connected and yet mutually distinct forms of human labor. Physical labor refers to people engaging in production activities using their muscles and consuming physical strength. Mental labor refers to people laboring through the human thinking organ—the brain. This is the difference between the two. However, the two are also connected. Strictly speaking, there is no purely physical labor or mental labor; the two cannot be absolutely separated. For example, when a worker operates a machine or a farmer tills the land, can you say that it is purely physical labor? No. Because, generally speaking, labor is a purposeful activity of mankind. Before labor, there is thought activity. "Planning" and "preparing" for production require mental labor, and even in primitive society, this cannot be denied. At the same time, to engage in the production of material goods, there must be production tools. Regardless of the level of development of production tools, people must master the production tools, and they must use their hands and muscles, consume different degrees of physical strength, and engage in physical labor. The material production base of the future communist society is large-scale machine production based on comprehensive electrification, complete mechanization, automation, and comprehensive chemicalization. The height of production development may even allow production to proceed with the push of a button. But compared to the past, this is only a difference in production tools. It still requires people to operate it and still has the nature of physical labor, and cannot be considered purely mental labor. Moreover, it should also be seen that, fundamentally speaking, production tools are created and invented by direct producers, and experience is accumulated by them year after year. There is also mental labor involved here, and this cannot be denied even in primitive society. Therefore, I believe that the division between physical labor and mental labor is based on the main aspects. Physical laborers and mental laborers are also classified according to their main engagement in a certain type of labor. Of course, the division between physical laborers and mental laborers reflects the existence of the difference between physical labor and mental labor and embodies a certain production relationship.

Since physical labor and mental labor are mutually connected and yet mutually distinct things, it can be said that as long as the production of material goods exists, regardless of the level of productive forces, the forms of physical labor and mental labor will exist.

If the level of productive forces and the development of production tools have any connection with physical labor and mental labor, I believe it is in two aspects. One aspect is that the level of productive forces determines the state of physical labor and mental labor and their role in human labor production. For example, in primitive societies and slave societies with extremely backward productive forces, people mainly struggled against nature with extremely heavy physical labor. Mental labor was extremely underdeveloped and played a secondary role. With the development of production tools and the improvement of people's production experience and skills, things change in the opposite direction with the degree of development of productive forces. In communist society with a high level of productive forces, there is no heavy physical labor, and mental labor plays a decisive role in production. Under the "pushing of buttons" to carry out production, there is the foundation of people's high culture and comprehensive development of science. The other aspect is that the level of productive forces determines the combination or separation of physical labor and mental labor. For example, with the emergence of slave society, due to the further improvement of productive forces, the development of social division of labor and exchange, private ownership emerged, and society was divided into the slave class and the slave owner class. Slave owners despised physical labor, lived parasitic lives, and completely imposed physical labor on slaves. A few slave owners engaged in the mental labor of science, art, and culture, creating the opposition between physical labor and mental labor. In capitalist society, where productive forces are more highly developed, social differentiation is expanded, and inequality in property ownership is unprecedentedly deepened, the vast working masses become appendages of machines, only engaging in monotonous, mechanical, and exhausting physical labor, and mental labor becomes the prerogative of the bourgeois gentlemen. Socialism has prepared political, economic, and other conditions for eliminating the difference between physical labor and mental labor. In communist society, due to the high development of productive forces, the high development of science and culture, and people becoming comprehensively developed new people, the difference between physical labor and mental labor will disappear.

We cannot look at the primitive society of thousands of years ago, when mankind had just separated from the animal kingdom and was at its lowest level, with today's eyes. At that time, the level of production was extremely low. Stone production tools were used for a long time, and only later did metal production tools appear. Agriculture and animal husbandry were still in a primitive state. Therefore, at that time, the struggle against nature was mainly through physical labor, and mental labor was underdeveloped and not obvious. However, as mentioned earlier, physical labor and mental labor are mutually connected and yet mutually distinct. Moreover, historical facts prove that in primitive society, mankind's extremely low-level and ignorant culture and art were forming and developing. In short, in primitive society, physical labor was combined with mental labor to become a unified form of human labor. It is wrong to deny that pressing a button with a hand has the nature of physical labor, and to believe that communism "eliminates" physical labor and that everyone is a mental laborer.

    体力劳动、脑力劳动并不是历史范畴
    汤照连
    我认为人韦把生产力的水平，生产工具的发达程度看作为体力劳动或脑力劳动存在或消失的根源、条件，从而把原始社会说成是只有体力劳动没有脑力劳动，在奴隶社会才出现脑力劳动，以及把共产主义社会说成是“人人都是脑力劳动者”，“体力劳动完全消失了”是不对的。生产力的水平，生产工具的发达程度，不是体力劳动、脑力劳动存在或消失的根源、条件，真正的根源、条件是人与自然的斗争，人类社会物质资料的生产。只要物质资料生产的存在，只要人类的生产劳动的存在，体力劳动和脑力劳动的形态就存在。体力劳动、脑力劳动都不属于历史范畴，只是它们二者之间的差别，以及反映这二者的差别的“体力劳动者”和“脑力劳动者”才是历史范畴。原始社会是体力劳动和脑力劳动结合的社会，根本不存在什么“体力劳动者”。共产主义社会是体力劳动与脑力劳动差别消失的社会，也根本不存在什么“脑力劳动者”。
    体力劳动与脑力劳动是互相联系而又互相区别的人类的劳动形态。体力劳动是指人们以自己的筋肉，以消耗体力的方式进行生产活动。脑力劳动是指人们通过人的思维器官——大脑来进行劳动。这是二者的区别。但是二者又有联系的。从严格意义上说是没有纯粹的体力劳动或脑力劳动的，二者是不能绝对分开的。如工人开机器，农民种地，你能说它是纯粹的体力劳动吗？不能。因为，一般来说，劳动是人类有目的的活动，在劳动以前就有思想活动，“计划”和“准备”生产，就要有脑力劳动，即使在原始社会这一点也不能否认。同时，要从事物质资料的生产，就要有生产工具，不管生产工具的发达程度如何，人要掌握生产工具，就要用手、筋肉，就要消耗不同程度的体力，就要有体力劳动。未来的共产主义社会的物质生产基础，是以全面电气化、全盘机械化、自动化和全面化学化为基础的大机器生产。生产发展的高度甚至一按电钮就可以进行。但是这和过去比较，也只是生产工具的不同而已，它还要人去操作，还具有体力劳动的性质，而不能认为是单纯的脑力劳动。而且，还应看到，从根本上来说，生产工具是直接生产者创造发明的，经验是由他们成年累月地积累下来的，这里面也有脑力劳动，在原始社会也不能否认这点。所以我认为划分体力劳动与脑力劳动是从主要方面去划分的。体力劳动者与脑力劳动者也是从他们主要从事某种劳动来划分的。当然体力劳动者与脑力劳动者的划分是反映了体力劳动与脑力劳动差别的存在，体现一定的生产关系。
    既然体力劳动与脑力劳动是互相联系而又互相区别的东西，因此，完全可以说只要物质资料生产的存在，而不管生产力的水平如何，体力劳动和脑力劳动的形态就存在。
    如果说，生产力水平、生产工具发达程度与体力劳动、脑力劳动有什么联系的话，我认为只有两方面。一方面是生产力的水平决定体力劳动、脑力劳动的状况，和在人类劳动生产中的作用。例如，在生产力极为落后的原始社会奴隶社会等，人们主要是以极其沉重的体力劳动与自然界作斗争。脑力劳动极其不发达和起着次要作用。随着生产工具的发展，人们生产经验和技能的提高，事情就随着生产力发展的程度，朝相反的方向变化。在生产力处于高度水平的共产主义社会，繁重的体力劳动没有了，对生产起决定作用的是脑力劳动。在
  “按电钮”进行生产的下面，有着人们的高度文化、科学的全面发展的基础。另一方面是生产力的水平决定了体力劳动与脑力劳动的结合或分离。例如在奴隶社会产生的同时，由于生产力的进一步提高，社会分工和交换的发展，产生了私有制，社会分裂为奴隶阶级和奴隶主阶级。奴隶主轻视体力劳动，过着寄生的生活，把体力劳动完全加到奴隶身上，少数奴隶主，从事科学、艺术、文化的脑力劳动，造成了体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立。在生产力有更高度发展，社会分化扩大，财产占有不平等空前加深的资本主义社会，广大工人群众变成机器的附属品，只从事单调的、机械的、疲惫的体力劳动，脑力劳动成为资产阶级老爷的特权。社会主义为消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别准备了政治经济等各方面的条件，在共产主义社会由于生产力的高度发展，科学文化的高度发展，以及人们成为全面发展的新人，体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别就归于消灭。
    我们不能以现在的眼光去看几千年前的、人类刚从动物界脱离出来的、人类最低级的原始社会。那时，生产水平极为低下，漫长的年代使用石制生产工具，后来才出现金属生产工具，农业和畜牧业还处于原始状态。因此，那时主要以体力劳动对自然界作斗争，脑力劳动不发达，表现不明显。但是正如前面所说的，体力劳动与脑力劳动是相互联系而又相互区别的。而且历史事实证明，在原始社会，人类的极其低级、蒙眛的文化、艺术正在形成和发展。总之，在原始社会体力劳动是与脑力劳动结合在一起，成为人类统一的劳动形态的。人韦否认以手去按电钮是有体力劳动的性质，认为共产主义“消灭”了体力劳动，人人都是脑力劳动者是不对的。
