Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Second National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress, lasting twelve days, victoriously concluded this afternoon.

The closing ceremony of the congress was held at 2:30 PM.

Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended today's closing ceremony. He gave important instructions at the meeting on the current tasks of building socialism and the prospects of communism, the work, labor, and study of young people, and the combination of continuing to promote the spirit of daring to think and act with a realistic attitude. In his speech, he finally represented the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in wishing the congress success and all representatives good health.

At the end of Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech, the audience responded with warm applause.

Then, Vice Premier Chen Yi and secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Liu Xiyuan, Luo Yi, Hu Keshi, and Wang Wei, awarded commemorative medals and prize banners in the name of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China to the youth activists present. Every youth activist attending this conference received a "Youth Activist Medal" inlaid with a portrait of Chairman Mao, and the representative of each advanced youth collective received a red prize banner with the words "Resolutely Be a Shock Brigade for Socialism and Communism."

Youth activists who have made contributions to the country and the people under the leadership of the Party, today accepted the honor and rewards given to them by the Party and the people with a feeling of infinite gratitude. Everyone of them was excited and beaming with joy. When their representatives stepped onto the rostrum to receive the commemorative medals and prize banners to the sound of melodious music, the entire audience stood up, and every youth activist wore a shiny commemorative medal on their chest. The representatives of the two thousand two hundred and twenty-eight advanced collectives raised the gold-lettered red banners high in their seats. At this time, thousands of red flags shone brightly from the crowds in the three-story stands on all sides of the venue, and the scene was extremely beautiful and spectacular.

At today's closing ceremony, the Young Pioneers of Beijing formed a gift-giving team to present gifts to the congress. When the children blew their bugles and beat their drums, 650 Young Pioneers, holding team flags and 160 red flags, entered the venue from all directions. At this time, orderly rows of "red scarves" filled the center of the venue, on the sidewalks of the three-story stands, and next to the seats of the youth activists. Ten-year-old female team member Zhang Yuqing read a passionate dedicatory speech to the congress, and ten Young Pioneers walked onto the rostrum holding exquisite gift trays. The trays were filled with radishes, corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts, tomatoes, sunflowers, as well as models of steel, coke, man-made fibers, chemical fertilizers, and machine tools. These were all the fruits of the labor of the Young Pioneers of the capital. The youth activists thanked the children for their deep affection with warm, rhythmic applause, and the "red scarves" threw colorful streamers and confetti on them. The youth and children were immersed for a long time in this colorful and joyful big family.

At today's closing ceremony, the youth activists and representatives of advanced youth collectives attending the congress unanimously passed the "Telegram of Respect to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao," the "Letter to the National Youth," and the "Telegram of Respect to the Fujian Frontline Troops."

Luo Yi, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, announced the victorious conclusion of the congress. He said: The biggest gain of this congress is that the Party Central Committee has clearly pointed out the direction for us to continue to move forward. Building socialism is a great and arduous historical task, which requires the hard work of the people of the whole country, and requires the youth to play a shock role in this great and glorious cause. Our task is to vigorously publicize this instruction of the Party, take the lead in implementing this instruction, and turn it into the practical action of 120 million young people.

Luo Yi said: The second gain of this congress is the study of advanced ideas and the exchange of advanced experiences. From the speeches of activists on various fronts, we have not only seen the great achievements of our country's youth in socialist construction, but also deeply realized the high tide of the communist spirit among our country's youth. Our task is to continue to promote this selfless labor and selfless communist ideology, to promote the spirit of courageous creation and a realistic attitude, and to create greater achievements in future work.

Luo Yi said: The third gain of this congress is that it has further made us realize the greatness of the creativity of the people and the power of the collective. Socialism is a collective undertaking, and only the unity and concerted efforts of millions of people on various fronts can lead to the achievements of the all-round Great Leap Forward and overcome any difficulties. Our task is to further strengthen ties with the masses, learn from the masses, and lead the broad masses to complete various tasks.

Luo Yi finally hoped that the youth must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and always maintain the excellent style of combining vigor and modesty. Never fall behind, and always stand at the forefront of the struggle.

After Luo Yi's speech, the band played the solemn national anthem. At 4:35, the closing ceremony ended in warm applause from the entire audience. (Attached picture)
