Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th: The second session of the Fifth Soviet Supreme Soviet continued today in the Kremlin.

    Delegates began discussing the issue of education reform. At yesterday's meeting, the Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Yelyutin, delivered a report on higher education.

    He pointed out that the nationwide discussion showed that the basic principles of the national education reform proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, which combined labor production with theoretical education, were warmly supported and unanimously endorsed by all Soviet people. Everyone believes that this is a necessary condition for the communist education of young people.

    Yelyutin said that the Soviet Union plans to complete the reform of the higher education system within three to five years, starting in 1959. He said that between 1959 and 1965, the number of students enrolled in Soviet higher and secondary specialized schools will be approximately eight million, and it is estimated that 2.3 million specialists will be trained, while only 1.7 million specialists were trained between 1952 and 1958. In this way, the number of experts trained by universities will increase by 40%, and in some departments, such as engineers in industry, construction, transportation, and communications, will increase by 90%, and experts in agriculture will increase by half.

    Yelyutin emphasized that with the reform of the higher education system, the theoretical level of experts should be improved. The role of universities in developing science, technology, and culture will also continue to increase. He said that there are currently more than 130,000 professors and teachers working in Soviet universities, accounting for half of all scientific workers in the country.

    Yelyutin told the delegates that the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education has formulated a draft of the higher education system based on the outlines of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers and the suggestions made during the discussion of these outlines. The basic principle of this draft is the combination of education and productive labor.

    At yesterday's meeting, Zelenko, Director of the Central Labor Reserve Administration of the Soviet Council of Ministers, delivered a report on vocational and technical education.

    He pointed out that in the next seven years, the Soviet national economy will widely implement comprehensive mechanization and automation in production, so the requirements for workers' technical level will be greatly increased, and it is necessary to expand and strengthen the training of cadres by fixed specialized schools.

    Zelenko said that the reform of the specialized technical education system stipulates the establishment of a unified type of school to replace the existing craft, railway, mining, construction, technical schools, and factory-affiliated schools.

    Zelenko said that the new specialized technical school is preparing to teach workers and rural laborers more than eight basic majors.

    At yesterday's meeting, Kairov, President of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Federation, also delivered a report on the reform of Soviet general secondary education.

    苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论教育改革问题
    教育结合生产劳动  培养共产主义新人
    新华社24日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：第五届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议今天在克里姆林宫继续举行。
    代表们开始对教育改革问题进行讨论。昨天的会议上苏联高等教育部长叶留金做了关于高等教育问题的报告。
    他指出，全民讨论表明了苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议提出的劳动生产与理论教育相结合的国民教育改革的基本原则受到了全体苏联人民的热烈支持和一致拥护。大家认为这是对青年进行共产主义教育的必要条件。
    叶留金说，苏联拟定从1959年开始，在三年到五年之内完成对高等教育制度的改革。他说，在1959年到1965年期间，苏联高等和中等专业学校的入学人数将有八百万人左右，估计将培养出二百三十万名专家，而1952年到1958年期间只培养了一百七十万名专家。这样高等学校培养出来的专家人数将增加40％，有些部门如工业、建筑、运输和交通方面的工程师将增加90％，农业方面的专家将增加一半。
    叶留金强调指出，随着高等教育制度的改革，应当提高专家的理论水平。高等学校在发展科学、技术和文化方面的作用也将不断提高。他说，目前在苏联高等学校工作的有十三万名以上的教授和教员，占国内全部科学工作者的一半。
    叶留金告诉代表们说，苏联高等教育部已根据苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议的提纲和讨论这些提纲时提出的建议制定了高等学校教育制度草案，这个草案的基本原则是教育和劳动生产相结合。
    在昨天的会议上苏联部长会议中央劳动后备管理局局长泽连科做了关于专业技术教育的报告。
    他指出，在未来的七年中，苏联国民经济在生产上将广泛实行综合机械化和自动化，因此对工人技术水平的要求将大大提高，必须扩大和加强固定专门学校对干部的培养工作。
    泽连科说，改革专门技术教育制度规定建立统一类型的学校，以代替现存的工艺、铁路、矿业、建筑、技术学校和工厂附设学校。
    泽连科说，新的专门技术学校准备把八种以上的基本专业教授给工人和农村劳动者。
    在昨天的会议上，俄罗斯联邦教育科学院院长凯罗夫还做了关于改革苏联一般中学教育的报告。
