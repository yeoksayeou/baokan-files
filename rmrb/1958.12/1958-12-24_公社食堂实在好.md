The Commune Canteen is Really Good

    The commune canteen is really good,
    Three meals a day, fragrant and full.
    Many kinds of dishes, good taste,
    The elderly and children, well taken care of.
    No worries about eating, no worries about cooking,
    Everyone's enthusiasm soars to the sky.
          (Anhui Folk Song)

    公社食堂实在好公社食堂实在好，一天三餐香又饱。菜样多，味道好，老人和小孩，照顾很周到。不愁吃，不愁烧，人人干劲冲九霄。
          （安徽民歌）
