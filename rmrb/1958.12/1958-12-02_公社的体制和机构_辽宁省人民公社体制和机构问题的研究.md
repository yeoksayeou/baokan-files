    The System and Organization of Communes
    --A Study on the System and Organization of People's Communes in Liaoning Province
    The Rural Work Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    People's communes have been fully realized in the rural areas of Liaoning Province. A total of 428 large-scale people's communes have been established, with an average of 7,628 households per commune. Among them, there are five large communes with one county as one commune. With the establishment of people's communes, all communes have made great reforms to their systems and organizations. After the reform, they generally adapted to the needs of the development of the situation and promoted the development of various production and construction undertakings.

    Now, we will compare and study several issues in the establishment of systems and organizations of people's communes in various regions.

    How Many Levels of Management are Best?

    Most of the people's communes in Liaoning Province have implemented a three-level management system based on the principle of "unified management, decentralized administration." For example, the October Revolution People's Commune in Suizhong County adopted a three-level management system of commune-work area-production team. The Gaiping County People's Commune (one county, one commune) also adopted a three-level management system of commune-brigade-small team. However, a few communes implemented a two-level management system of commune-production team or a four-level management system of commune-branch commune (office, grassroots commune)-work area-production team (the four-level management is mainly implemented by large communes with one county as one commune). From practice, the three-level management system has many advantages, mainly: ① It can reduce the upper-level institutions and management cadres, and enable cadres to reduce trivial matters and spare more time to participate in production and lead production; ② It can closely combine unified leadership with adapting to local conditions, and can overcome subjectivism and decentralism in production guidance; ③ It can solve problems for the masses anytime and anywhere, and it is convenient for commune members to handle affairs; ④ It can establish party organizations in accordance with production management units, which is more conducive to giving play to the party's leadership and supervision role. The two-level management system, from practice, has many drawbacks: too many management units in the commune, inconvenient guidance; commune cadres are overwhelmed with affairs and cannot participate in production; powers are too concentrated, and problems cannot be handled in a timely manner. Large-scale people's communes with one county as one commune can adopt four or three levels. As for some small people's communes, there is no need to implement a four-level management system, because too many levels will slow down communication, which is not conducive to production and leadership.

    Should the Work Area be Nominal or Substantial?

    The so-called nominal and substantial mainly refers to whether the work area manages money, accounts, and distribution. If it manages money, accounts, and distribution, it is substantial; otherwise, it is nominal. In the past, there were different opinions on whether nominal or substantial was better. Some advocated that nominal was better for the work area, believing that substantial would create too many levels and ineffective command; others advocated that substantial was better. Practice has proven that for large-scale people's communes with large scale and many contents like today, the work area level must be substantial; otherwise, it will be difficult to adapt to work needs. The advantages of a substantial work area are: ① It is convenient to give play to the work enthusiasm, initiative, and bold responsibility of the work area level; ② It is convenient to strengthen the specific leadership of various undertakings; ③ It is convenient to organize large-scale cooperation of various departments according to the work needs of the work area; ④ It reduces the number of distribution leadership units in the commune, so that the commune can concentrate its efforts on leading production. Of course, some small communes, whose work areas were nominal in the past and felt convenient, can remain unchanged.

    How Many Levels of Representation are Best?

    People's communes in various regions have affirmed that the commune member representative assembly is the highest authority of the commune, so they have all set up commune member representative assemblies. However, there are two methods in the specific settings: one is a one-level representative system, that is, the commune-level representative system; the other is a two-level representative system, such as the Deli Temple People's Commune in Fuxian County, in addition to the commune-level representative assembly, also set up a level of representative meeting in the work area. The work area-level representative meeting is only responsible for managing commune affairs and does not exercise the functions of state power. Its main tasks are: to discuss and decide on major issues within the scope of management of the work area, to inspect and supervise the work of the work area, and to elect or remove work area cadres. The advantages of the two-level representative system are: the number of representatives is large, which is convenient for absorbing a large number of activists to participate in the management of the commune, convenient for reflecting opinions from all aspects, and also convenient for mobilizing the broad masses to implement the party's policies and the commune's resolutions. This two-level representative system, under the current situation that the average scale of people's communes has reached 7,000 to 8,000 households, with vast areas and large populations, its implementation will be greatly beneficial to fully promoting democracy and should be widely promoted. The total number of commune member representatives should not be too small, generally accounting for 1% of the number of commune members, and the number of work area representatives should generally account for 5% of the total number of commune members.

    Is it Better to Have More or Fewer Working Departments?

    After the scale of the commune expanded, due to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, the commune's organization must also have appropriate division of labor. In order to manage various construction undertakings, people's communes in various regions generally established a number of departments with division of labor and responsibilities under the commune affairs committee according to work needs based on the principle of "both organizing a capable team and managing various undertakings of the commune well." However, in the specific settings, the number and details vary. For example, the Deli Temple People's Commune in Fuxian County only set up six departments: agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, industry, finance and trade, culture and education, public security and armed forces, and office, etc. Each department manages a lot of things, and relatively important work such as the planning committee and the welfare committee are also concurrently managed by the office. From practice, this setting method has fewer institutions and thicker lines, which can easily lead to neglecting one thing while attending to another, and it is not easy to manage all undertakings well. However, in some places, too many departments are set up, and the division of labor is too detailed. For example, the branch communes under the Tieling County People's Commune have eight departments: industry and transportation, agriculture and water conservancy, forestry and animal husbandry, finance and trade, culture and education, health, armed forces, political and legal affairs, labor and wages, etc., and twelve departments including the planning committee, scientific research institute, supervision committee, and office. More than 50 cadres are equipped. This will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of a large organization and too many cadres, and it is also easy to cause collisions between each other. Generally speaking, it is more appropriate for a commune to set up eight to ten departments, such as: agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, industry, finance and trade, culture and education, health, armed defense, planning and statistics, wages and welfare, scientific research and other departments.

    Is it Better to Have More or Less Authority?

    In terms of the powers of each department, some communes only play the role of staff departments, that is, assisting the commune affairs committee in formulating work plans and putting forward work suggestions, and then implementing them after the commune affairs committee approves them, without directly commanding the work of the work area. In some communes, the departments play the role of command departments, directly convening meetings and directly arranging work. From the actual effect, the former approach is better, which can maintain the unified leadership of the commune affairs committee and reduce the workload of the work area, but attention should also be paid to grasping the principle of "major matters decided collectively, small matters managed by the commune director," otherwise it will excessively increase the affairs of the commune affairs committee. The latter approach, although it can reduce the burden on the commune affairs committee, is prone to decentralism, collisions between work, and makes the work area unable to cope.

    How Should County-Level Organizations be Set Up?

    At present, most counties in Liaoning Province are studying how to set up county-level organizations to meet the needs of the development of the situation. Tieling, Kangping, Andong, Gaiping, and Fuxian counties have begun to adjust county-level organizations. From the perspective of several counties that have acted earlier, there are several different approaches:

    One is to combine some business organizations of the party, government, and commune under the principle of strengthening the party's political and ideological leadership. For example, the party committees of Tieling, Kangping, Andong, and other counties retain organizations, publicity, supervision committees, and offices, etc., and merge the rural work department, finance and trade department, industry department, and other business departments with the relevant bureaus of the county people's committee. The other is to remain unchanged. From the current point of view, the former approach is better, which not only streamlines the party and government organizations, reduces the number of upper-level staff, but also strengthens the party's leadership and gives play to the role of the county people's committee and the county joint commune, thereby basically adapting to the needs of current work development.

    There are also different approaches to the setting up of county-level departments: the first is a coarse-grained approach, such as the county-level organization of Fuxian County only has five departments and one office: agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, industry and transportation, finance and trade (commerce, taxation, finance, grain), culture and education, health, public security and armed forces, and office. The second is a fine-grained approach, such as Tieling County established eighteen units including agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, labor and wages, health, construction, civil affairs, industry, commerce, electromechanical, culture and education, finance, personnel, public security, court, procuratorate, and scientific research. The third is neither coarse nor fine, such as Andong County, which has nine departments (internal affairs, industry and transportation, finance and grain, agriculture, wages and welfare, commerce, construction, culture and education, health, armed forces), one bureau (public security bureau), two courts (court, procuratorate), and two committees (planning committee, science committee) and other fourteen units. From the actual implementation point of view, the approach of Andong County is better, which not only implements the principle of organizing a capable team, but also can manage various undertakings.

    公社的体制和机构
    ——辽宁省人民公社体制和机构问题的研究
    中共辽宁省委农村工作部
    辽宁省农村已经完全实现人民公社化，先后共建成大型的人民公社四百二十八个，平均每社七千六百二十八户，其中一县一社的大公社有五个。随着人民公社的建立，各社对体制和机构都有了很大的改革，改革后一般都适应了形势发展的需要，推动了各项生产建设事业的发展。
    现在将各地人民公社建立体制和机构中的几个问题加以比较和研究。
    实行几级管理制好？
    辽宁省多数人民公社根据“统一经营，分级管理”的原则，推行了三级管理制。如绥中县革命十月人民公社采取了公社——作业区——生产队三级管理制。盖平县人民公社（一县一社）也采取了公社——大队——小队三级管理制。但也有少数社实行公社——生产队的两级管理制或公社——分社（办事处、基层社）——作业区——生产队的四级管理制（实行四级管理的主要是一县一社的大社）。从实践中看，三级管理制的好处很多，主要有：①能减少上层机构和管理干部，并使干部减少了琐碎事务，能抽出更多的时间参加生产领导生产；②能把统一领导和因地制宜密切结合起来，可以克服生产指导上的主观主义和分散主义；③能随时随地给群众解决问题，社员办事方便；④能按照生产管理单位建立党的组织，更便于发挥党的领导监督作用。两级管理制，从实践中看有不少弊病：社的管理单位过多，指导不便；社干部事务缠身，不能参加生产；权利过于集中，处理问题也不能及时。一县一社的大型人民公社采用四级或三级都可以。至于有些小型人民公社，就没有必要实行四级管理制，因为层次过多，上下通气慢，既不利生产，也不便于领导。
    作业区是虚的好还是实的好？
    所谓虚和实，主要是指作业区管不管钱，管不管账，管不管分配。如果管钱、管账又管分配就是实的，否则就是虚的。过去对虚的好还是实的好，各地有不同意见，有的主张作业区是虚的好，认为实的就会造成层次过多，指挥不灵；另一种主张是实的好。实践证明，像今天这样规模大、内容多的大型人民公社，作业区一级必须是实的，否则就很难适应工作需要。作业区是实的，它的好处是：①便于发挥作业区一级的工作积极性、主动性和大胆负责的精神；②便于加强对各项事业的具体领导；③便于根据本作业区工作需要，组织各部门大协作；④减少了社的分配领导单位，使社内可以集中力量领导生产。当然有些小社，作业区过去就搞虚的，而且觉得还方便，也可以不予改变。
    实行几级代表制好？
    各地人民公社，都肯定了社员代表大会是公社的最高权力机关，因而都设置了社员代表大会。但在具体设置上有两种方法，一种是一级代表制，即社一级代表制；另一种是两级代表制，如复县得利寺人民公社除了社一级代表大会外，在作业区还设置了一级代表会议。作业区一级代表会议，只负责管理社务，不行使政权职务，它的主要任务是：讨论决定作业区管理范围内的重大问题，检查监督作业区的工作，选举或撤换作业区干部。两级代表制的好处是：代表名额多，便于吸收广大积极分子参加社的管理，便于反映各方面的意见，也便于动员广大群众贯彻党的政策和公社的决议。这种两级代表制，在目前人民公社的规模平均已达七、八千户，地域辽阔和人口众多的情况下，推行起来将大大有益于充分发扬民主，宜于普遍推行。社员代表会总名额不宜过少，一般都要占社员人数的1％，作业区代表会名额，一般要占社员总数的5％。
    工作部门多点好还是少点好？
    社的规模扩大以后，由于农林牧副渔、工农商学兵综合性的全面发展，社的机构也必须有适当的分工。为了分管各种建设事业，各地人民公社一般都根据“既要组织精干，又要把公社各项事业管好”的原则，在社务委员会下面按照工作需要，建立了若干分工负责的部门。但在具体设置上，却多少和粗细不一。如复县得利寺人民公社只设置了农林水利、工业、财贸、文教、公安武装和办公室等六个部，每个部管的事情很多，像计划委员会和福利委员会等比较重要的工作，也都由办公室兼管。从实践看来，这种设置方法，机构少了些，线条粗了些，极易造成顾此失彼，不易把各项事业都管好。但是，有的地方，部门设置的过多，分工过细。如铁岭县人民公社下面的分社，设有工业交通、农业水利、林牧、财贸、文教卫生、武装、政法、劳动工资等八个部和计划委员会、科学研究所、监察委员会、办公室等十二个部门。配备干部五十多人。这样势必造成机构庞大、干部过多的现象，也易出现互相碰头的局面。一般说，一个公社设置八至十个部门较为合适，如：农林、水利、工业、财贸、文教卫生、武装保卫、计划统计、工资福利、科学研究等部门。
    职权大点好还是小点好？
    在各部门的职权上，有的社只起参谋部的作用，即协助社务委员会制订工作计划，提出工作建议，经社务委员会批准后再去执行，不直接指挥作业区的工作。有的社各部门则起着指挥部的作用，直接召开会议，直接布置工作。从实际效果看，还是前一种作法好，它能够保持社务委员会的统一领导，减少作业区的工作负担，但也应注意掌握“大事集体决定，小事社长分管”的原则，否则也会过分地增加社务委员会的事务。后一种作法，虽然能够减少社务委员会的负担，但是易于产生分散主义，工作互相碰头，使作业区应付不暇。
    县级机构怎样设置好？
    目前辽宁省多数县都在研究县级机构怎样设置才能适应形势发展的需要，铁岭、康平、安东、盖平、复县等县已经开始调整县级机构。从行动较早的几个县来看，有几种不同的作法：
    一种是在加强党的政治思想领导的原则下，党、政、社的某些业务机构合一。如铁岭、康平、安东等县的党委保留组织、宣传、监委和办公室等机构，而把农村工作部、财贸部、工业部等业务部门和县人民委员会有关的局合并。另一种就是仍按原封不动。从目前看来，还是前一种作法较好，它既精简了党政机构，减少了上层工作人员，又加强了党的领导，发挥了县人民委员会和县联社的作用，从而基本上适应了当前工作发展的需要。
    在县级部门的设置上也有不同的作法：第一种是粗线条的，如复县的县级机构只设农林水利、工业交通、财贸（商业、税收、金融、粮食）、文教卫生、公安武装、办公室等五部一室。第二种是细线条的，如铁岭县设立了农林、畜牧、劳动工资、卫生、建设、民政、工业、商业、机电、文教、财政、人事、公安、法院、检察院、科学研究等十八个单位。第三种是不粗不细的，如安东县设九个部（内务、工业交通、财粮、农业、工资福利、商业、建设、文教卫生、武装）、一个局（公安局）、二个院（法院、检察院）、二个会（计划委员会、科学委员会）等十四个单位。从实际执行上看，还是安东县的作法为好，它既贯彻了组织精干的原则，又能把各项事业都管起来。
