Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The China Asian-African Solidarity Committee Statement Regarding "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day":

November 30, 1958

The China Asian-African Solidarity Committee warmly responds to and supports the call of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" on December 1st. This powerful call represents the strong aspirations of the broad masses of African people to strive for national independence and end colonial rule. It also reflects the common will of the people of Asia and the world to oppose imperialist aggression and defend world peace.

In recent years, the people of Asia and Africa, especially the people of West Asia and Africa, have achieved greater and greater victories in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence and the maintenance of national independence. The heroic people of the United Arab Republic defeated the armed attack of British and French imperialism and shattered the war threats and subversive conspiracies of US imperialism. The people of Iraq used the fire of national revolution to break the chains of the Baghdad Pact. The Algerian people have persisted in their victorious armed struggle and formally established the Provisional Government of the Republic. The armed aggression of US and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan suffered a shameful defeat and they had to withdraw their invading troops. Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana and Guinea have successively declared their independence. Encouraged and propelled by this series of victories, the entire African people are becoming increasingly awakened. Africa, once regarded as the "Dark Continent," is now becoming the front line against imperialism.

However, imperialism will never automatically withdraw from Africa. They are desperately struggling. They vainly attempt to maintain their criminal rule and continue to enslave the African people through means of brutal suppression and political deception. It is particularly worth noting that American imperialism is taking advantage of the African people's desire for independence, using "aid" as a guise to actively intervene in African affairs. The United States is intensifying its economic plunder in Africa, establishing military bases and trying its best to undermine the unity of the African people. The entire conspiracy of the United States is to replace British and French imperialism and place the shackles of neo-colonialism on the heads of the African people. However, these imperialist tricks cannot fool the African people. Neither old colonialism nor neo-colonialism can stop the heroic African people from moving towards independence and freedom.

The holding of "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" is not only a symbol of the further unity of the Asian and African people and a major encouragement to the African people's struggle for national independence, but also a strong support for the upcoming All-African People's Conference in Accra. The All-African People's Conference is a major political event in Africa today. We believe that this conference will make a positive contribution to promoting the national independence movement in Africa and the unity of the African people.

The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the African people for national independence and against colonialism and racial discrimination. At the same time, the Chinese people have also been greatly encouraged by the struggle of the African people. The Chinese people will do their best to develop friendship with the African people and strengthen mutual support between us. The Chinese people believe that with the support of socialist countries, peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the great African people will surely be able to overcome any difficulties and drive the imperialist forces out of Africa. The struggle of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America for national liberation will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent telegrams to eleven trade union organizations in Asia and Africa, warmly responding to the call of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" on December 1st. The eleven trade union organizations to which the All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent telegrams are: the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions, the Sudanese Federation of Trade Unions, the Moroccan Labour Union, the Ghana Trades Union Congress, the General Union of Black African Workers, the General Union of Workers of Equatorial Africa, the General Union of Algerian Workers, the General Confederation of Algerian Trade Unions, the All-Nigeria Trade Union Federation, and the Tunisian Workers' Union.

In the telegram, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the Chinese workers, expressed concern, sympathy and support for the heroic struggle of the Arab and African workers and people against imperialism, colonialism and racial discrimination, and expressed its firm belief that the day when the Arab and African people drive imperialism out of Africa is not far away. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also pointed out in the telegram that US imperialism is currently intensifying its plunder of Africa's wealth and actively intervening in and interfering in Africa's internal affairs. This new colonialist conspiracy will surely be exposed and shattered by the increasingly united Arab and African people.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th. On the eve of "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" on December 1st, the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation respectively sent telegrams to the African Youth Council, the Senegalese Youth Council, the Algerian Muslim Students' Union, the Federation of Black African Students in France, the Makerere University Students' Union of Uganda, and the West African Students' Union in the United Kingdom, expressing support for the African people's struggle against imperialism.

In the telegrams, the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation said: "On the occasion of December 1st - Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day, we would like to extend our highest respect and firm support to the African people and youth and students who are engaged in the heroic anti-imperialist struggle, on behalf of the Chinese youth and students. We believe that victory will surely belong to the African people who are engaged in unremitting struggle against colonialism and for national independence. May the friendship and unity between Chinese and African youth grow day by day."

    新华社30日讯  中国亚非团结委员会关于“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的声明
    1958年11月30日
    中国亚非团结委员会热烈响应和支持亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处关于在12月1日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召。这一有力的号召，代表了广大非洲人民争取民族独立和结束殖民主义统治的强烈呼声，同时也反映亚洲和全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的共同意志。
    近几年来，亚非人民特别是西亚、非洲人民，在反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争中，取得了越来越大的胜利。英勇的阿拉伯联合共和国人民打败了英法帝国主义的武装进攻，击破了美帝国主义的战争威胁和颠复阴谋。伊拉克人民用民族革命的烈火烧断了巴格达条约的锁链。阿尔及利亚人民坚持了胜利的武装斗争并且正式成立了共和国临时政府。美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略遭到了可耻的失败，不得不撤出他们的侵略军队。苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳和几内亚相继宣布了独立。在这一连串胜利的鼓舞和推动下，整个非洲人民正在日益觉醒，过去被看成是“黑暗大陆”的非洲现在正在成为反对帝国主义的前线。
    但是，帝国主义决不会自动地退出非洲。他们正在绝望地挣扎。他们妄图用残酷镇压和政治欺骗的手段，维持他们的罪恶统治，继续奴役非洲人民。特别值得注意的是，美国帝国主义正在利用非洲人民渴望独立的心情，以“援助”为名，积极插手非洲的事务。美国正在非洲加紧经济掠夺，建立军事基地并且竭力破坏非洲人民的团结。美国的全部阴谋就是要代替英法帝国主义，把新殖民主义的枷锁加在非洲人民的头上。但是，帝国主义的这些阴谋花样是愚弄不了非洲人民的。不论是老殖民主义也好，新殖民主义也好，都无法阻挡英勇的非洲人民走向独立和自由。
    “帝国主义滚出非洲日”的举行，不仅是亚非人民进一步团结的象征和对非洲人民争取民族独立斗争的重大鼓舞，而且也是对即将在阿克拉召开的全非人民大会的有力支持。全非人民大会是当前非洲的重大政治事件。我们相信，这次大会将对促进非洲的民族独立运动和非洲人民的团结，作出积极的贡献。
    中国人民一贯同情和支持非洲人民争取民族独立和反对殖民主义、反对种族歧视的正义斗争。同时中国人民也从非洲人民的斗争中得到了很大的鼓舞。中国人民将尽力发展和非洲人民的友谊，并且加强我们之间的相互支持。中国人民相信，在社会主义国家、全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，伟大的非洲人民一定能够克服任何困难，把帝国主义势力从非洲赶出去。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取民族解放的斗争一定能够得到最后的胜利。
    新华社30日讯  中华全国总工会今天打电报给亚非地区的十一个工会组织，热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处关于在12月1日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召。全总致电的十一个工会组织是：阿拉伯工会国际联合会、埃及工会联合会、苏丹工会联合会、摩洛哥劳工联合会、加纳工会大会、黑非工人总联合会、赤道非洲工人总联合会、阿尔及利亚工人总联合会、阿尔及利亚工会总联合会、全尼日利亚工会联合会、突尼斯工人联合会。
    中华全国总工会在电报中代表中国工人对阿拉伯和非洲的工人和人民为反对帝国主义、殖民主义和种族歧视而进行的英勇斗争表示关怀、同情和支持，并且表示深信阿拉伯和非洲人民把帝国主义赶出非洲的日子已经不远。全总还在电报中指出，目前美帝国主义正在加紧掠夺非洲的财富并积极插手和干涉非洲的内部事务。这个新的殖民主义阴谋必将被日益团结的阿拉伯和非洲人民识破和粉碎。
    新华社30日讯  中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会在12月1日“帝国主义滚出非洲日”前夕，分别打电报给非洲青年理事会、塞内加尔青年理事会、阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生联合会、黑非洲留法学生联合会、乌干达马吉尔大学学生会和留英西非学生联合会等非洲青年学生组织，声援非洲人民反对帝国主义的斗争。
    全国青联和全国学联在电报中说：“值此12月1日——帝国主义滚出非洲日之际，谨代表中国青年和学生向正在进行英勇反帝斗争的非洲人民和青年和学生表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。我们相信胜利一定属于为反对殖民主义和争取民族独立而进行不懈斗争的非洲人民。愿中国和非洲青年之间的友谊和团结与日俱增。”
