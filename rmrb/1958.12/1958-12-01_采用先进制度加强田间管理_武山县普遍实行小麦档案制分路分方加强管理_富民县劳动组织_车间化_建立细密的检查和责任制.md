According to a report in the Gansu Daily, Wushan County, Gansu Province, is universally implementing a wheat record system, dividing roads and plots to strengthen field management.

In order to achieve the goal of high yield in the coming year, Wushan has decided to cultivate more than 70,000 mu of high-yield fields, accounting for 26% of the county's 270,000 mu of winter wheat. The implementation of the wheat record management system is one of the advanced measures taken by Wushan to achieve these yield targets. The main contents of this management system are: classifying and numbering each wheat field, noting the targets and measures, explaining the allocation of management personnel and the progress of actual work, as well as inspection and acceptance. Recently, the Wushan County Party Committee inspection team conducted a systematic inspection and ranking of autumn-sown wheat according to the requirements of establishing a record system, and verified the implementation of various measures. Now, each plot has been registered, signs have been inserted in the fields, and each mu of land has a dedicated person responsible for management. Leaders of the commune are responsible for areas, leaders of the team are responsible for blocks, and leaders of the group are responsible for mu, achieving responsibility for tasks, measures, and quality. The completed and future measures to be supplemented for each plot are filled in the record and announced to the masses for supervision. Through inspection, ranking, and the establishment of a record management system, the county has replanted and re-sown 60% of the third-class wheat fields.

The masses of Wushan have summarized five benefits of the wheat record management system: (1) Cadres and the masses have a clear understanding of production and can strengthen planning; (2) Fixed personnel enhance the sense of responsibility, and motivation is greater; (3) Plans and measures are implemented in each plot, and the "Eight-Character Charter" is better guaranteed; (4) Crops are registered, making it easy to check and summarize experience; (5) Signs in the fields clearly show the quality of work, facilitating competition and evaluation.

The second advanced method adopted by Wushan County is to implement road and plot division for field management in more than 70,000 mu of large-scale high-yield fields throughout the county. The Red Star People's Commune's approach is to divide more than 11,000 mu of "high-yield fields" into four roads and eight plots. In each road, eight yield-increasing plots are divided according to soil quality, flatness, water conservancy facilities, transportation, and other conditions. Each yield-increasing plot has more than a thousand mu of wheat fields. To facilitate centralized management and study and improve cultivation techniques, management bureaus have been established on all four roads, and a Red and Expert University has also been established. Each yield-increasing plot has established a management office, equipped with strong commune cadres and Party members as leaders, and also technical personnel.

These new field management methods have been implemented by the Wushan County Party Committee based on the need for the great development of diverse economies of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries after communization. It can well summarize and promote the yield-increasing experience of "high-yield fields," further improve cultivation techniques, and train technical personnel; it can also uniformly allocate labor, centralize management, facilitate large-scale collaboration between mountains and rivers, adapt to the militarized production organization, and strengthen the responsibility system. More importantly, it can truly achieve garden-like management on nearly one-third of the cultivated land and create the experience of large-scale high-yield fields.

According to a report in the Yunnan Daily, Fumin County, Yunnan Province, is actively improving the production management system, fixing professional teams, and realizing the workshop-ization of field management for spring crops. They have established a detailed inspection and responsibility system in terms of labor organization to ensure that the management of spring crops is strictly carried out in accordance with the requirements of vegetable gardening.

The county noted that production management only focused on the use of large-scale collaboration and crash campaigns, and there were no fixed professional teams or detailed production responsibility systems, which often easily led to neglecting one thing while attending to another. Many effective measures could not be effectively guaranteed to be implemented on time, with quality, and in accordance with technical operating procedures, which would inevitably affect the large-scale high yield of spring crops. Therefore, while proposing the requirement of realizing spring crop vegetable gardening, the county party committee decided to further improve the production management system, fix professional teams, and achieve the workshop-ization of field management.

The method of improving field management is to first draw more than 8,000 laborers from various communes, with Party members, core militia members, and grassroots militia members as the backbone, to form a professional team for spring field management, fix them, and guard the position. This professional team is commanded by the county's spring crop headquarters, with the first secretary of the county party committee personally taking charge. Below, it is divided into thirty war zones, and each war zone is divided into several workshops. In total, the county is divided into 156 workshops. This workshop actually becomes the basic combat unit for spring crop management. For example, the Daying Brigade of the Diligent People's Commune has formed a field management workshop committee, with the brigade leader as the workshop director and the production team leader as a member. According to planting varieties, water conservancy conditions, management conditions, etc., it is divided into seven workshop groups. Generally, a workshop has 25 to 30 people, responsible for managing 70 to 150 mu of land. The brigade also selected 48 activists to serve as production management committee members. The purpose of doing this is to ensure that spring management is the responsibility of dedicated personnel and strives for perfection. In addition, a Red and Expert school, a public canteen, and a nursery have been established in each war zone to facilitate the arrangement of life and learning of production technology for members of each workshop.

After the county established a production responsibility system at all levels, especially after realizing the workshop management system, a new look has emerged in spring crop management. Within six or seven days, all spring crops were watered once, covered with one layer of fertilizer and one layer of ash, 50% of the wheat was compacted with soil, more than 1,600 new toilets were dug, and the ditches were dredged. In this tense production, in addition to the fact that each commune established an inspection team to conduct irregular inspections to the brigades, and each brigade regularly inspected the workshops, each workshop also adopted the method of inspection to people, through two evaluations a day, mutual inspection and evaluation in work, regular commendation, criticism, etc., the responsibility is clear, and the quality is strictly guaranteed. It truly achieves that every ridge is managed and every seedling is inspected.

With the establishment of professional teams and the strengthening of the production responsibility system, coupled with the guidance of the Red and Expert School, members have begun to enthusiastically study and grasp the laws of spring crop growth in production, ensuring that spring crop management is getting better and better. For example, Yongding First Brigade found that 120 mu of wheat seedlings were yellowing. After the members studied, they knew that it was a manifestation of potassium deficiency, so they immediately used stove ash and straw ash to cover it, and the wheat seedlings turned green after two days. Due to the improvement of management, the management of spring crops throughout the county has basically reached the requirements of vegetable gardening. (Attached picture)

    采用先进制度加强田间管理
    武山县普遍实行小麦档案制分路分方加强管理
    富民县劳动组织“车间化”建立细密的检查和责任制
    据甘肃日报消息  甘肃省武山县普遍实行小麦档案制度，分路分方加强田间管理。
    为了实现明年高额丰产的计划，武山确定培养七万多亩高额丰产田，占全县二十七万多亩冬小麦的26％。实行小麦档案管理制度就是武山为了达到这些丰产田的产量指标所采取的先进措施之一。这个管理制度的主要内容是：把各小麦田分类编号注册，注明指标和措施，说明管理人员的配备和实际工作的进度，以及检查、验收等情况。最近，中共武山县委检查组根据建立档案制的要求，对秋播小麦进行系统的检查排队，并且核定各项措施的施行情况。现在，每块地都已进行登记，地里都插上了牌子，每亩田都有专人负责管理，社的领导包片，队的领导包块，组的领导包亩，做到包任务，包措施，包质量。每块地把已完成和今后应弥补的措施都填在档案上，并向群众公布，以便在群众监督下实现。全县通过检查排队和建立档案管理制，并补种和翻种了60％的小麦三类田。
    武山群众总结小麦档案管理制有五个好处：（一）干部群众对生产心中有数，能加强计划性；（二）固定了专人，加强了责任感，干劲更大了；（三）计划措施扎到每块地，贯彻执行“八字宪法”更加有了保证；（四）庄稼存家底，便于检查和总结经验；（五）地里插牌子，工作好坏分明，便于竞赛和评比。
    武山县采取的第二个先进办法是：在全县七万多亩大面积高额丰产田内，实行分路分方的田间管理。红星人民公社的做法是：把一万一千多亩“丰产田”分为四路八方。在各路中，又按土质、平整程度、水利设施、交通等条件，划了八个增产方。每个增产方的麦地都在千亩以上。为了便于集中管理，研究改进耕作技术，四路都成立了管理局，还设立了一处红专大学。各个增产方成立经营所，配备了强有力的社干部和党团员作领导，并搭配了技术人员。
    这些新的田间管理办法，是中共武山县委根据公社化后需要农林牧副渔多种经济大发展的情况实行的。它可以很好总结推广“丰产田”的增产经验，进一步改进耕作技术，培养技术人员；也可以统一调配劳力，集中管理，便于山川大协作，适应军事化的生产组织，加强责任制。更重要的是可以在近三分之一的耕地上，真正做到园田化，创造大面积高额丰产田的经验。
    据云南日报消息  云南省富民县积极改进生产管理制度，固定专业队伍，实现小春作物田间管理车间化。他们从劳动组织上建立了一套细密的检查责任制，以确保小春作物管理工作严格地按照菜园化的要求进行。
    这个县鉴于生产管理只注意运用大协作、大突击的方法，没有固定的专业队和细密的生产责任制，往往容易顾此失彼，许多有效措施不能切实保证按时、按质、按技术操作规程贯彻下去，势必影响小春作物大面积高产。因此，县委在提出实现小春菜园化要求的同时，决定进一步改进生产管理制度，固定专业队伍，做到田间管理车间化。
    改进田间管理的办法是，首先从各公社抽调了八千多个劳动力，以党团员基干民兵为骨干，组成一支小春田间管理专业队伍，固定下来，坚守阵地，这支专业队伍由全县小春总指挥部指挥，县委第一书记亲自挂帅，下面又划分为三十个战区，各战区下面又分为若干个车间。总计全县共划分为一百五十六个车间。这种车间实际成为小春作物管理的基层战斗单位。如勤劳人民公社大营大队，组成了田间管理车间委员会，大队长任车间主任，生产队长任委员，根据种植品种、水利条件、管理条件等等，划片分为七个车间小组，一般一个车间有二十五人到三十人，负责管理七、八十亩到一百五十亩土地，大队又挑选积极分子四十八人担任生产管理委员。这样做的目的，是使小春管理做到有专人负责，精益求精。另外，还在每一个战区成立了一个红专学校，一个公共食堂和托儿所，方便各车间社员安排生活和学习生产技术。
    全县这样层层建立生产责任制，特别是实现车间化管理制以后，小春作物管理已出现新面貌。六、七天的时间内，就把所有的小春作物润了一次水，盖了一道肥和一道灰，给50％的麦子捶了一道土，新挖了一千六百多个厕所，并疏通了沟道。在这个紧张的生产中，除了各公社成立检查团、不定期检查到大队，各大队定期检查到车间外，各个车间还采取检查到人的办法，通过一天两评比，做活中互相检查评比、定期表扬、批评等方式，责任分明，严格保证了质量。真正做到了墒墒有人管，苗苗有人查。
    随着专业队伍的建立和生产责任制的加强，再加上红专学校的辅导，社员们已开始在生产中热心钻研掌握小春作物成长的规律，保证小春作物管理好上加好。如永定一大队发现有一百二十亩麦苗发黄，经社员们研究后，知道了是钾肥缺少的表现，于是立即用灶灰、稻草灰去压，麦苗两天后就转绿了。由于管理工作有了改进，全县的小春作物管理已基本上达到了菜园化的要求。（附图片）
