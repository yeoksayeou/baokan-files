    The Bumper Harvest of Diligence and Frugality in Work-Study Programs
    —A Record of the Achievements of Harbin No. 18 Middle School in Implementing the Policy of Combining Education and Labor
    By Our Correspondent
    The factories built by Harbin No. 18 Middle School through work-study programs are all built from scratch and in a simple and crude manner. The work-study labor is diverse, and each student is generally fixed on one type of productive labor each semester, while also participating in other productive labor appropriately. This not only satisfies the diverse interests and hobbies of young people but also enables them to learn a variety of skills.
    Since the launch of work-study activities, No. 18 Middle School has always paid attention to ensuring that the weekly class time is not less than thirty hours. The labor time, in the earlier period, depending on the amount and intensity of labor on campus and social voluntary labor and the students' physical condition, was generally around eight hours, and the labor was carried out in a decentralized manner. This arrangement allowed students more time for physical exercise, reviewing lessons, and playing.
      Adhering to Labor Education
    No. 18 Middle School was founded in the winter of 1954. From the first day of its establishment, it paid attention to labor education for students. The backyard of the new school building was originally a large garbage dump, and the basic construction unit left a lot of building materials here. Principal Wang Yousheng led the students to clean up 50 cubic meters of wood and other materials from the garbage and waste. The principal then led the students to use these waste materials to make more than 1,400 pieces of school equipment, teaching aids, and other items. Wang Yousheng is an old Party member who fought guerrillas in the New Fourth Army. He brought the fine traditions of running education in the old liberated areas to No. 18 Middle School. This "rural style" and "guerrilla habits" of cultivating students' love of labor and thrift were opposed by some people. Some teachers in the school said he was "kicking bricks, picking up nails, and not doing his job"; some colleagues in the education field called him "Boss Wang" (the cart driver), because he had once driven a cart with the students. Some people in society also opposed students' labor, with some parents saying, "Isn't it just a few bucks short? Just pay some tuition, there's no need to let the students work," and others saying, "If this continues, it's better to just drop out and find a job."
    The leadership core of No. 18 Middle School did not yield to these erroneous views in the slightest. For four years, they have been paying attention to labor education for students and have established metalworking and woodworking groups; they have listed metalworking and woodworking courses as basic courses in the school.
    Cultivating Students' Simple and Frugal Thinking
    How should an ordinary middle school carry out work-study programs? No. 18 Middle School had two completely different views. Some teachers believed that if the school was going to have labor, it should have decent factories or go to large factories outside the school to work. The leadership core of the school proposed another view: some students participate in labor in factories outside the school; more importantly, students should start with the labor of collecting waste products and use abandoned materials to start from scratch and carry out work-study activities on campus in a simple and crude manner. This can cultivate students' simple and frugal thinking from an early age.
    The school leaders entrusted this glorious task to Class One of Grade Three, led by Party member teacher Wang Da. At the beginning, many students in Class One of Grade Three blushed, found it difficult to speak, and wore gloves when collecting waste products; they pinched their noses to do it. However, these students gradually developed a strong interest in this "indecent" thing during labor. They learn many new things every day: square steel, flat steel, angle steel, copper. Every dilapidated item, whether sent to the factory or kept at the school, can be turned into extremely useful new things. They began to realize the meaning of this labor. The students beat gongs and drums, shouting and laughing as they collected waste products on the street. Yuan Xinmin, the daughter of the director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau, once led her classmates to collect waste products at her doorstep. A female neighbor in her forties shouted, "Oh, you're collecting garbage too!?" Yuan Xinmin immediately explained the significance of collecting waste products to her.
    The students sorted out the collected waste products by category, and while sorting, they listened to the teachers explain the properties and uses of various items. The waste warehouse became a "treasure trove." They repaired the broken generator found in the waste pile and built a bicycle-powered power station for the school; they designed and built a woodworking factory building with collected broken bricks, tiles, and waste wood, dividing it into a woodworking workshop and a wooden furniture workshop; the metalworking group expanded into a metal factory due to the availability of waste metal as raw materials. They installed waste machine tool parts into a three-foot lathe; old iron bars were made into beautiful baby carriages; rusty window screens were made into fly swatters; rotten iron wires were straightened, wrapped in green paper, and made into paper flower stems; and smelly and dirty animal bones could also be boiled into bone meal. The work-study activities of No. 18 Middle School were carried out in this way.
    Many Benefits from Combining Education and Labor
    From the beginning of work-study programs, some teachers simply did not believe that teaching could be combined with labor. They said: teachers do not have time to prepare lessons, students do not have time to review their lessons, how can the quality of teaching not decline!
    Have the students' grades declined? Class One of Grade Three was originally the worst class in the school in terms of average grades. Out of the 52 students in the class, 6 were held back; in the chemistry test, 27 students scored two points. After the work-study program, the lowest total score of the seven basic courses in the graduation exam was four points. The students learned a lot of practical knowledge in the work-study program that they had not yet learned in books, and they also improved their socialist consciousness. The students in Class One of Grade Three cultivated a spirit of collectivism in labor. They listed the grades of all students in the class for each subject, and everyone helped those who were lagging behind. Collecting waste products and doing metalwork allowed the students to learn about a wide variety of metals and acquire knowledge of "material properties" that is only available in high school physics. Students who participated in work-study programs at the light bulb factory had learned about electric welding, cathodes, and anodes in class, but when they started welding filaments, they did not know where the anode was. After labor practice, they realized that the carbon rod they were holding in their hands was the anode. In the past, students' articles were empty and hollow. After participating in labor, the students' lives became richer, and there was endless content to write about in labor. This semester, the students in the whole school have written more than 4,000 poems alone, in addition to essays and plays.
    A female teacher once said: only one-fifth of the students have mathematical minds and can learn mathematics well. Another geometry teacher also believed that abstract mathematics was unrelated to labor. Once, when this geometry teacher was doing carpentry work with the students, he saw that the students wanted to plane a square wooden pillar into a round pillar. Without a round plane, the students drew a circle on the cross-section of the wood, and planed off the appearing edges and corners one by one with a flat plane, and finally planed it into a round pillar. However, these students had not yet learned a few geometric theorems. He suddenly realized that the geometric theorem "a polygon becomes a circle when it reaches its limit" was originally produced in this way in labor. Later, he taught geometry in combination with his feelings in carpentry labor practice, and the students reflected that the teacher had not changed, but the lectures were easier to understand than before.
    The practice of work-study programs educated those teachers who held bourgeois educational views and gradually made them realize that the combination of education and labor can improve the quality of teaching. A geometry teacher said: "Now I really believe that abstract sciences like mathematics are also produced from labor."
      Unpaid Labor
    The students of No. 18 Middle School participate in work-study activities as unpaid labor. Most of the income is used to expand the types and equipment of work-study activities, and a small part is used for the collective welfare of the students and to subsidize students with more difficult economic situations. This practice was once opposed by some people. At a middle school conference in Harbin, many middle school principals believed that some of the income should be distributed to the students, and the only question was how much was appropriate, because labor has been rewarded since ancient times. Some parents and students also believed that they should be paid for their work. No. 18 Middle School was not so clear and firm about the issue of income distribution at the beginning. Principal Wang Yousheng only believed that those who worked more would be paid more, and students who were young, weak, and had difficult family economies could not get much benefit from work-study programs; while students from wealthy families would feel that there was no need to participate in labor. This would bring the remnants of social economic inequality into the school. However, Wang Yousheng was not sure what to do.
    Therefore, the school gave this problem to the students for debate. Wang Peiyu, a student in Class Six of Grade Three, proposed that work-study is a labor course stipulated by the state, and every student must take it, and take it well. We do not ask the school for money for physics and chemistry classes, so why should we ask the state for money for labor classes? This Communist Youth League member advocated that all income should be controlled by the school and used to expand the school's work-study equipment. Wang Yuequan, the son of a railway worker, said: The significance of work-study is to exercise the body and transform the mind, not to make money for individuals. He advocated that students with difficult family situations and good labor attitudes could be given some subsidies from the income of work-study.
    Through this debate, the masses educated themselves, clarified the meaning and purpose of work-study, and also put forward specific opinions on income distribution, which enabled the school to determine the distribution method: 70% of the income is used to expand production and increase work-study equipment; 30% is used for the collective welfare of the students, including subsidies for poor students. Now No. 18 Middle School has achieved free haircuts, free movies, and the expenses of annual festivals and parties do not require students to pay. Students from poor families, in addition to receiving state grants, can also receive subsidies from the income of work-study. After graduation, the school is economically responsible for sending them to new schools.
    Lively and Vigorous Political Work
    In the work-study activities of No. 18 Middle School, the school's Party branch closely grasped the Party's assistant—the Communist Youth League organization—to carry out lively and vigorous political and ideological work among teachers and students, and fought against bourgeois ideology from beginning to end.
    The school leaders, with the Party branch as the core, proposed long ago that the assessment of the success of work-study programs in each class should be based on five accounts, namely, ideological gains, academic performance, health status, productive labor (labor attitude and labor skills learned), and economic benefits are fifth. The comparison of work-study programs between classes is based on ideology, learning, unity, labor, and cultural and sports activities, not on how much money is earned. The Communist Youth League General Branch organized bumper harvest and leap forward conferences for work-study programs, report meetings on work-study programs, etc., to fight against the bourgeois ideas of some teachers. At the beginning of the work-study program, it was discovered that a female teacher had repeatedly instilled bourgeois selfish and self-interested ideas into the students when she led them to the factory to collect waste metal. When weighing, she taught the students the tricks of using tilted scales, adding a little, and taking a little. When other classes reported to the school with an all-round harvest in five aspects, this female teacher also reported to the school with the most income as the main content. The Communist Youth League members in her class opposed this practice, and no one was willing to read the report letter. The Communist Youth League organization organized a great debate on this issue in this class, and the students said that they felt ashamed that this teacher led everyone to carry out work-study programs in this way. This debate educated the teacher and also educated all the students.
    In the re-election of student cadres for work-study factories, farms, and shops in the class League branches, the Party's class line was also implemented. With the education and help of the League organization, the vast majority of students firmly supported all the correct practices related to work-study programs put forward by the school's leadership core.
  Sparks of Communist Ideology
    In just over half a year, the work-study activities of No. 18 Middle School have profoundly changed the face of the school and its students. The students regard the school as their home and are often reluctant to leave even very late at night.
    Zhao Jun, a student in Class One of Grade Three, had suffered from abuse by his stepmother since he was a child and had lost confidence in life. The work-study program changed his attitude towards life. He wrote to the Communist Youth League organization: "The care of the old workers and the friendship between classmates have given me the warmth that I have never received at home." After graduation, he was still reluctant to leave and stayed in the school's woodworking factory to work until the night before he went to report to his new job. Many graduates want to do more work for their alma mater before leaving school. The students automatically whitewashed all the walls of the school. Students in Class Six of Grade Three, in order to commemorate the Party's birthday, took time out from the tense graduation exam period to decorate the auditorium neatly and beautifully, painting the walls with light blue peace doves. They said: "After we leave, we can let the younger brothers and sisters in the next few classes hold meetings and activities in this beautiful auditorium."
    This idea of "predecessors planting trees, descendants enjoying the shade" is not an isolated case in No. 18 Middle School. Several students in Class Ten of Grade Three were boiling barium chloride in the school's chemical factory. The firewood was rotten grass that was almost fertilizer, and the fire could not be lit. After finally finding a few broken willow baskets, they dismantled and broke these baskets, sorted them into bundles of firewood, but left them untouched for the students of the next class to burn. The Young Pioneers often cleaned the business street where the school is located, and planted many flowers and trees. This summer and autumn, both sides of the street have been filled with flowers.

    勤工俭学的鲜花硕果
    ——记哈尔滨十八中学贯彻教育和劳动相结合的方针的成绩  
    本报记者
    哈尔滨十八中学在勤工俭学中兴建的工厂，都是因陋就简、白手起家的。勤工俭学的劳动多种多样，每个学生每学期大体固定在一种生产劳动上，同时也适当参加其他生产劳动。这样，既满足了青少年多种的兴趣和爱好，又使他们学会多种技能。
    十八中学开展勤工俭学活动以来，一直注意坚持每周上课时间不少于三十小时。劳动时间，前一时期，根据校内劳动和社会义务劳动的多少、轻重、学生体力情况，一般是八小时左右，而且分散进行劳动，这样安排，就使学生有较多的时间进行体育锻炼、温习功课和玩耍。
      坚持进行劳动教育
    十八中学是1954年冬天创办的，从建校第一天就注意对学生进行劳动教育。新校舍的后院原来是大垃圾场，基本建设单位在这儿扔下很多建筑材料。校长王又生领着学生从垃圾堆和废料中清理出了五十立方公尺的木料和其他物资。校长又带着学生利用这些废材料制成一千四百多件校具、教具和其他东西。王又生是一个在新四军里打过游击的老党员。他把党在老解放区办教育的优良传统带到十八中来。这种培养学生爱劳动、尚勤俭的“农村作风”、
  “游击习气”遭到了一些人的反对。学校一部分教员说他“踢砖头，拣洋钉，不务正业”；教育界一部分同行叫他“王老板子”（赶车的），因为他曾经和学生一块儿赶车劳动。社会上也有人反对学生劳动，有的家长说：“不就是缺几个钱吗？出点学费就是了，不必让学生干活”，有的说：“这样干下去，不如干脆退学找工作”。
    十八中学的领导核心，对这些错误认识丝毫没有让步，四年来一直注意对学生进行劳动教育，建立了金工、木工小组；把金工课、木工课列为学校的基础课程。
    培养学生俭朴的思想
    一个普通中学怎样开展勤工俭学，十八中学有两种完全不同的主张。一部分教师认为：要劳动学校就应该有现成像样的工厂，或者到校外的大工厂去干活。学校领导核心却提出另一种主张：一部分学生参加校外工厂劳动；更主要的是让学生从收购废品的劳动入手，利用被人遗弃的物资，白手起家，因陋就简地开展校内勤工俭学活动。这样可以从青少年时代开始，培养学生俭朴的思想。
    学校领导把这个光荣的任务交给党员教师王达领导的三年一班去完成。三年一班相当多的学生，开始收废品都是脸发热，口难开，戴着手套；捏着鼻子去干。可是，这班学生在劳动中逐渐对这样“不体面”的事情产生了浓厚的兴趣。他们每天都接受许许多多的新知识：方钢、扁钢、三角钢、紫铜。每一件破旧不堪的物品，不论送到工厂还是留在学校，都能变成极其有用的新东西。他们开始认识了这种劳动的意义。学生们打着锣鼓，满大街吆喝着，又说又笑地收废品。黑龙江省水产局长的女儿原新民，有次领着同学来到自己家门口收废品，一个四十多岁的女邻居大叫起来：“哟，你也收起破烂儿来啦！？”原新民当场向她讲了收购废品的意义。
    学生们把收购来的废品，分门别类整理出来，一边整理一边听教师讲解各种物品的性能、用途。废品仓库变成了“万宝囊”。他们把从废品堆中找出来的破发电机，经修理建成了学校用脚踏车转动的发电站；用收集来的残砖断瓦和废木料，自己设计盖成木工厂房；分成木工车间和木器家具车间；金工组由于有了废金属作原料，扩大成金工厂。他们把废机床零件安装成了三尺车床；旧铁棍儿做成漂亮的婴儿车；锈窗纱做蝇拍；烂铁丝砸直了，缠上绿纸，做纸花梗；又腥又脏的兽骨头还能熬骨粉。十八中学的勤工俭学活动，就这样搞起来了。
    教育和劳动结合好处多
    从勤工俭学一开始，一部分教师根本不相信教学能和劳动结合，他们说：教师没有时间备课，学生没有时间复习功课，教学质量怎么能不降低！
    学生的成绩是否降低了呢？原三年级一班，在勤工俭学前是全校平均成绩最差的班级，全班五十二名学生中，有六个留班；化学测验，得两分的有二十七人。勤工俭学以后，毕业考试的时候，七科基础课程，总评成绩最低的学生是四分。学生们在勤工俭学中学到了许多书本上还没有学到的活知识，并且提高了社会主义觉悟。三年级一班的学生们在劳动中培养了集体主义精神，他们列出全班学生的各科成绩表，一个落后，大家帮助。收废品，做金工，使学生们认识了多种多样的金属，学到了只有高中物理才有的“材料性能”知识。在灯泡厂参加勤工俭学的学生，课堂上学过电焊、阴极、阳极，但开始电焊灯丝，却不知道阳极在哪里，经过劳动实践，才知道手里拿着的炭棒就是阳极。过去，学生写的文章空空洞洞，参加劳动以后，学生的生活丰富了，劳动里有写不完的内容。全校学生这学期单是诗已经写了四千多首，另外还有散文、剧本。
    一位女教师曾经说：只有五分之一的学生具有数学头脑，才能学好数学。另一位几何学教师，也曾经认为抽象的数学和劳动无关。有一次，这位几何教师和学生一起干木工活的时候，看到学生要把方木柱刨成一根圆柱，没有圆面刨子，学生们在木头的横断面上画一个圆，用平面刨子依次刨去出现的棱角，最后刨成了圆柱，而这些学生还没有学到几条几何定理。他恍然领悟“多边形达到极限时就成为圆”的一条几何定理，原来就是这样在劳动中产生的。以后，他结合木工劳动实践的感受讲授几何学，学生们反映：老师没换，讲的比以前容易懂了。
    勤工俭学的实践教育了那些抱有资产阶级教育观点的教师，使他们逐渐认识到教育和劳动相结合能够提高教学质量。一位几何教师说：“现在我才真正相信，像数学这样抽象的科学也是从劳动中产生的。”
      不计报酬的劳动
    十八中学的学生们参加勤工俭学活动都是不计报酬的劳动，绝大部分收入用来扩大勤工俭学活动的种类和设备，小部分用于学生的集体福利和补助经济情况比较困难的学生。这种作法曾经受到一部分人的反对。在哈尔滨一次中等学校会议上，许多中学校长认为收入应该分给学生一点，只是分多少合适的问题，因为自古以来劳动就得给报酬。一些家长和学生也认为，干活就得给钱。十八中学对收益分配问题，开始也不是那么明确、坚定。校长王又生只是认为：谁劳动的多谁就分的钱多，年小体弱家庭经济困难的学生，不能在勤工俭学中得到多少补益；而家庭富裕的学生会感到没有参加劳动的必要。这样就会把社会上经济不平等的残余带到学校里来。但是，究竟应当怎样做，王又生也没有把握。
    于是，学校把这个问题交给学生去辩论。原三年六班学生王佩玉提出：勤工俭学是国家规定的一门劳动课，每个学生都得上，而且要上得好。我们上物理、化学课不向学校要钱，为什么上劳动课向国家要钱呢？这位共青团员主张收入全部由学校支配，用来扩大学校勤工俭学的设备。铁路工人的儿子王曰权说：勤工俭学的意义，是为了锻炼身体，改造思想，不是为了个人赚钱。他主张家庭困难、劳动态度好的学生，可以从勤工俭学收入中给一些补助。
    通过这场辩论，群众教育了自己，明确了勤工俭学的意义、目的，也提出了收入分配的具体意见，使学校确定了分配办法：收入的70％用于扩大生产，增加勤工俭学的设备；30％用于学生的集体福利，包括对贫困学生进行补助。现在十八中学已经作到了免费理发，免费看电影，年节晚会的支出也不要学生出钱。家庭清寒的学生，除了领取国家助学金外，还可以由勤工俭学的收入中领取补助，毕业后由学校在经济上负责送到新学校。
    生动活泼的政治工作
    十八中学在勤工俭学活动中，学校的党支部紧紧抓住党的助手——共青团组织，在教师和学生中进行生动活泼的政治思想工作，自始至终同资产阶级思想进行斗争。
    以党支部为核心的学校领导早就提出：各班检查勤工俭学开展的好坏要算五笔账，即思想收获、学习成绩、健康状况、生产劳动（劳动态度和学到的劳动技能），经济收益是第五位。班级之间评比勤工俭学，比思想、比学习、比团结、比劳动、比文娱体育活动，不比挣的钱多少。共青团总支组织了勤工俭学丰收跃进大会、勤工俭学报捷会等，同一些教师的资产阶级思想进行斗争。在勤工俭学一开始，发现一位女教师在领导学生到工厂收购废金属的时候，曾多次向学生灌输资产阶级自私自利的思想。过秤的时候，她把什么抬头秤，低头秤，添一点，拿一点的名堂，都教给了学生。当其他班以五项全面丰收向学校报捷的时候，这位女教师也以收入最多为主要内容报捷。她这一班的共青团员们反对这种作法，谁也不肯去念报捷信。共青团组织就这一问题在这个班里组织了大鸣大放大辩论，学生们说，这位老师领导大家这样开展勤工俭学，他们感到羞耻。通过这次辩论，教育了这位教师，也教育了全体学生。
    在各班团支部改选勤工俭学工厂、农园、商店的学生干部人选上，也都贯彻了党的阶级路线。经过团组织的教育与帮助，绝大部分学生坚决支持学校领导核心提出来的一切有关勤工俭学的正确做法。
  共产主义
  思想的火花
    时间不过半年多，十八中学的勤工俭学活动已经使学校和学生的面貌起了深刻变化。学生把学校当作自己的家，常常晚上很迟了还舍不得离开。
    三年一班学生赵俊，从小受尽继母虐待，曾经对生活失去信心。勤工俭学使他改变了人生态度。他写信给共青团组织：“老工人的关怀，同学间的友爱，使我得到从来没有在家受到过的温暖”。毕业后，他仍恋恋不舍地留在学校的木工厂劳动，直到去新岗位报到前夜才离开。很多毕业生离校前都想为母校多干些工作。学生们自动把全校墙壁粉刷得洁白。三年六班学生为了纪念党的生日，在紧张的毕业考试期中，还抽时间把小礼堂布置得整齐、美观，墙壁刷上淡蓝色的和平鸽。他们说：“我们走了后，可以让下面几班的弟弟妹妹们在这漂亮的礼堂里开会、活动。”
    这种“前人栽树、后人乘凉”的思想在十八中学不是个别的。三年级十班几个学生在学校化工厂熬氯化钡，柴火是近乎肥料的烂草，火怎么也烧不旺，好容易找到了几个破柳条筐，他们把这些筐拆开、折断，理成一捆捆的柴枝，却一根不动地留下来让下一班劳动的同学烧。少先队员们经常把学校所在的商务大街，清扫得干干净净，还种了许多花木，今年夏秋，这条街的两旁已经开满了鲜花。本栏照片均为本报记者张励之胡  伟摄（附图片）
