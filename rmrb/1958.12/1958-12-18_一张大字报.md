    A Big-Character Poster
    It was 11 o'clock at night, and the customers had all left. The workers at the Xicheng District No. 1 Barber Shop were about to close when a person suddenly walked in, saying he wanted a haircut. The workers, who were preparing to leave, readily agreed and warmly welcomed him. After the haircut, the customer reached into his pocket, only to find it empty. He had forgotten to bring money when he left home. What to do? Calling the office was no use; everyone was asleep. Who would bring the money? Seeing the customer's worried expression, the barber quickly said, "It's okay, just pay next time!" With that, he politely saw the customer to the door.
    Two days later, the barber shop received a big-character poster that read:
    "Your leaping enthusiasm is truly high,
    Diligently and tirelessly serving customers
    Getting a haircut late at night,
    Living in the new society is truly something to be proud of
    And things turned out so conveniently,
    That I forgot to bring my wallet when I left home
    But you said that's alright,
    And I could trouble you again next time
    Your enthusiasm and kindness
    Made me excited and moved beyond words
    My only repayment to you is
    To serve you all even better.
                Cai Chusheng"

    一张大字报
    深夜十一点，顾客都走光了，西城区第一理发馆的工人正打算关门，这时，忽然走进个人，他说想理发。准备卸班的工人一口答应，热情地接待他。理完发，客人一掏口袋，糟糕，口袋空空如也，出门时忘了带钱。这怎么办？打电话到机关，人家都睡了，谁给送钱来？理发师看见客人着急的样子，忙说：“不要紧，下次来时再说吧！”说罢，还很客气地把客人送到门口。
    过了两天，这家理发馆收到一张大字报，上面写着：
    “你们跃进的干劲真高，
    辛勤不息的在为顾客效劳
    快半夜了还能理上头发，
    生活在新社会里真是足以自豪
    事情更是十分凑巧
    我出门时竟忘记了带上钱包
    可那您们说那没关系呀
    下次来时再打扰
    您们的热情和厚道
    使我兴奋又感动的不得了
    我对您们唯一的报答是
    让我也为您们服务的更好。
                蔡楚生”
