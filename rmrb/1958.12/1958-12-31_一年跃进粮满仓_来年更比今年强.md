Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: At the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units, seven representatives reported on their achievements and expressed greater determination.

    The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction continued today. Li Dequan, Deputy Director of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and Minister of Health, gave a report on the basic situation of the Patriotic Health Campaign in 1958 and future tasks. Representatives from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Jilin Province, Guangdong Province, Guizhou Province, Liaoning Province, Yunnan Province, and Hebei Province made speeches at the meeting.

    Sima Yisheng, representative of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Minister of Rural Work Department of the CPC Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee), said: The agricultural production achievements in Xinjiang in 1958 are unprecedented. The growth rate of total grain output is equivalent to ten times the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period. This year's autumn crops have increased significantly, and many large-scale high-yield and high-yield records have appeared, which is of far-reaching significance to Xinjiang, which has always been characterized by extensive planting and low yields.

    Xu Feng, representative of Jilin Province (Deputy County Head of Jiaohe County), said in his speech that Jilin Province's total grain output this year increased by 45% compared to last year, and soybean production increased by 19%. This is a step forward in the history of Jilin Province, which has vast land, a small population, and extensive cultivation. However, compared with the rest of the country, the leap forward is still relatively small, and agricultural production has not fundamentally turned over. He said that if Jilin Province wants to achieve a major turnaround in agricultural production, it must resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and create conditions for a great leap forward next year.

    Zhu Rong, representative of Guangdong Province (Director of Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture), said that the increase in total grain output in Guangdong Province this year is equivalent to more than six times the total increase in grain production during the First Five-Year Plan period. The unprecedented and extremely large bumper harvest of late rice has greatly changed the face of agricultural production in Guangdong Province and laid a good foundation for a greater leap forward in unit area yield of rice next year.

    Zhao Qingru, representative of Guizhou Province (Deputy Director of Guizhou Provincial Department of Agriculture), said: Guizhou Province has completed its steel production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded the target this year. In agriculture, we overcame the worst drought since liberation, and the total grain output increased by nearly 100% compared to last year. The afforestation area is more than seven times the afforestation area during the First Five-Year Plan period. Hog production increased by nearly 100% compared to last year. Various cash crops and specialties have been greatly developed. There has also been a leap forward in cultural, educational and health undertakings. All of this shows that the poverty and backwardness left over from the history of Guizhou Province are rapidly changing.

    Luan Rukuan, representative of Liaoning Province (Commissioner of Andong Prefecture, Liaoning Province), said that Andong Prefecture suffered the worst drought in 40 years this year, and then suffered the worst flood in recorded hydrological history in early August. However, the total grain output of the entire prefecture still exceeded the bumper year of 1957 by 34%, with an average of 1,000 jin of grain per person.

    Wang Jiaxun, representative of Yunnan Province (Secretary of the Dengchuan County Party Committee), said that Dengchuan County's total grain output this year doubled compared to last year, with an average of 1,800 jin of grain per person based on the county's population; animal husbandry has basically achieved full mating and full pregnancy, and full production and full survival. He said that next year, on the basis of this year's great leap forward, they will further change the face of the county's agricultural economy.

    Jiao Jiaju, representative of Hebei Province (Secretary of the Anguo County Party Committee and County Head of Anguo County), said that the average grain yield per mu in Anguo County this year increased by more than two times compared to last year; cotton yield per mu (lint) increased by 80%; and peanut yield per mu increased by 100%. The county averaged more than 1,700 jin of grain per person. The county has also established more than 2,000 factories of various types, refining more than 3,000 tons of steel. Jiao Jiaju said: The fundamental reason for achieving victory is to adhere to putting politics in command and conscientiously implement the mass line working method.

    一年跃进粮满仓  来年更比今年强
    在全国农业先进单位代表会议上七位代表汇报成绩表示更大决心
    据新华社30日讯  全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议今天继续举行。中央爱国卫生运动委员会副主任、卫生部部长李德全在会上作了关于1958年爱国卫生运动的基本情况和今后的任务的报告。新疆维吾尔自治区、吉林省、广东省、贵州省、辽宁省、云南省、河北省的七位代表在会上作了发言。
    新疆维吾尔自治区代表（中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会农村工作部部长）司马益牙生说：新疆1958年农业生产所取得的成绩，是史无前例的。粮食总产量增长的速度相当于第一个五年计划期间平均增产率的十倍。今年秋季作物增产幅度较大，出现了很多大面积丰产和高额丰产纪录，这对一贯广种薄收的新疆来说，具有深远意义。
    吉林省代表（蛟河县副县长）许凤在发言中说，吉林省今年粮食总产量比去年增加45％，大豆增产了19％。这在吉林省地多人少、耕作粗放的历史上是向前跃进了一步，但和全国比较起来，跃进的幅度还是比较小，农业生产还没有从根本上翻身。他说，吉林省农业生产要想大翻身，必须坚决执行农业“八字宪法”，为明年的大跃进创造条件。
    广东省代表（广东省农业厅厅长）朱荣说，广东省今年粮食总产量比去年增产的部分，相当于第一个五年计划期间粮食增产总和的六倍多。由于晚稻空前的特大的丰收，大大改变了广东省农业生产的面貌，为明年水稻单位面积产量更大的跃进打下了良好的基础。
  贵州省代表（贵州省农业厅副厅长）赵庆儒说：贵州省今年钢铁生产提前超额完成了任务。农业方面战胜了解放以来从未有过的大旱灾，粮食总产量比去年增产近一倍。造林面积相当于第一个五年计划期间造林面积的七倍多。生猪生产比去年增长近一倍。各种经济作物和特产有很大发展。文教卫生事业也出现了跃进局面。所有这些都说明，贵州省历史上遗留下来的贫穷落后的面貌正在迅速改变着。
    辽宁省代表（辽宁省安东专署专员）栾汝琨说，安东专区今年遭到四十年来未有的大旱，8月初又遭到一场有水文记载以来未有的大水。但是全专区粮食总产量仍然比丰收的1957年超过了34％，平均每人有粮食一千斤。
    云南省代表（中共邓川县委书记）王家训说，邓川县今年粮食总产量比去年翻了一番，按全县人口平均，每人有粮食一千八百斤；畜牧业基本上做到了满配满怀，全产全活。他表示明年要在今年大跃进的基础上，进一步改变全县农业经济的面貌。
    河北省代表（中共安国县委书记、安国县县长）焦家驹说安国县今年粮食平均亩产量比去年增长两倍多；棉花亩产量（皮棉）增长80％；花生亩产量增长一倍。全县平均每人有粮一千七百多斤。全县还办起了各种工厂二千多个，炼出钢铁三千多吨。焦家驹说：取得胜利的根本原因，是坚持政治挂帅，并认真贯彻群众路线的工作方法。
