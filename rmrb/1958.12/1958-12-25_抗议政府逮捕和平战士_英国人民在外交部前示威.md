Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, London dispatch: Hundreds of British people demonstrated in front of the British Foreign Office on the 22nd, protesting the British government's arrest of forty-five peace fighters who participated in demonstrations against the construction of American missile bases, including the well-known Reverend Scott. These forty-five people were arrested by the police during mass demonstrations at the American missile base near Norfolk in eastern England. The British government has decided to try them in court on December 29th.

Reverend Scott and others refused to guarantee that they would not hold similar demonstrations against missile bases before the trial, so they will spend Christmas in prison.

During the demonstration in front of the British Foreign Office on the 22nd, clashes occurred between the demonstrators and the police, and several people were arrested.

    抗议政府逮捕和平战士
    英国人民在外交部前示威
    新华社24日讯  伦敦消息：几百个英国人民22日在英国外交部门口举行了示威，抗议英国政府逮捕四十五个参加了反对建筑美国导弹基地的示威的和平战士，其中包括著名的牧师斯科特。这四十五个人是在英格兰东部的诺福克附近的美国导弹基地举行的群众示威中被警察逮捕的。英国政府决定在12月29日开庭审讯他们。
    牧师斯科特等拒绝保证在开庭以前不再举行类似的反对导弹基地的示威，他们因此将在监狱中过圣诞节。
    22日在英国外交部门口示威的群众同警察发生了冲突，其中有几人被拘捕。
