Changchun, December 17th (Our Newspaper) - The Kailintun Paper Mill in Jilin Province has mobilized the masses to carry out technical renovations in every workshop, section, and process, revising unreasonable technological regulations and technical management systems. This has increased the daily output of chemical pulp from twelve batches before October to sixteen batches in early December. The single highest record for chemical pulp cooking time, created in March of this year, has become the factory's daily production level, with the average cooking time per batch of pulp reaching four hours and twenty-six minutes. This enabled the factory to complete the state plans for chemical pulp and machine-made paper two months ahead of schedule. As of December 10th, it has increased the production of more than 5,500 tons of pulp and more than 1,100 tons of paper for the state.

Due to the Party Committee's full mobilization and reliance on the working masses, the progress of this movement has been extremely rapid. The workers in the pulping workshop, responsible for pulp production, have revised fifty-eight technological regulations from mid-November to the present, adjusting all forty-odd processes in the workshop to advanced levels and comprehensively improving equipment capacity. The wood preparation section of this workshop used to be the weakest link in the factory. In this movement, the wood chip specifications and saw specifications were revised based on workers' suggestions, increasing the hourly output of wood chips from sixty cubic meters to more than eighty cubic meters, meeting the requirements of producing sixteen batches per day.

As early as March of this year, during the competition between this factory and the Shixian Paper Mill, a few people believed that the high-yield movement would disrupt "normal order" and violate process regulations. They regarded various technological regulations as inviolable creeds, causing workers to passively implement them. After the factory's Party Committee detected this tendency, it guided workers to engage in extensive debates, making all factory employees realize that the factory had great potential. Everyone believed that production should not be maintained in its original state according to the principle of mutual restraint, but should be continuously developed according to the principle of mutual promotion. Therefore, in June of this year, the daily output of pulp for the entire factory increased from eight batches at the beginning of the year to twelve batches.

In October, the factory's Party Committee launched another mass movement, mobilizing all factory workers to speak out freely, discuss, and formulate the targets for each workshop and section, so that the targets of each workshop and section were consistent with the factory's unified targets, achieving "all streams flow into the sea, thousands of threads become one rope." In the process of establishing a new balance, constant attention was paid to the coordination between workshops, between sections, and between processes, strengthening weak links. For example, in October, due to the increase in production capacity, the power and steam supply became strained for a time, resulting in an imbalance between power and production. The factory's Party Committee immediately mobilized the workers to build four small power stations, and the boiler section also improved its operating methods, so that the power supply and steam supply increased rapidly. Thus, a new balance was re-established at a higher level between the power workshop and the production workshop.

At present, the mass movement in the Kailintun Paper Mill is developing in depth, consolidating the production capacity of balancing daily production of sixteen batches, and further mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop the cutting-edge technology of two-stage cooking, striving towards the direction of producing thirty-two batches of chemical pulp per day.

### 好规章促进生产  开山屯造纸厂群众修订技术规程  最高纪录变成全厂日常生产水平

    好规章促进生产
    开山屯造纸厂群众修订技术规程
    最高纪录变成全厂日常生产水平
    本报长春17日电  吉林省开山屯造纸厂发动群众，在每个车间、工段和工序进行技术改造，修订不合理的工艺技术规程和技术管理制度；使全厂化学纸浆的日产量由10月份以前的十二锅增加到12月上旬的十六锅；把今年3月份所创造的每锅化学纸浆蒸煮时间的单项最高纪录，变为全厂的日常生产水平，平均每锅纸浆的蒸煮时间达到四小时二十六分，使全厂提前两月完成今年化学纸浆和机制纸的国家计划。到12月10日为止，共为国家增产了五千五百余吨纸浆，一千一百余吨纸张。
    由于党委充分发动和依靠了工人群众，这次运动的进展极为迅速。担负纸浆生产任务的制浆车间的工人们，从11月中旬到现在，修定了五十八项工艺技术规程，把全车间的四十余道工序都调整到先进水平，全面提高了设备能力。这个车间的调木工段过去是全厂的薄弱环节，在这次运动中，根据工人意见修定了投木规格和刀锯规格，使每小时的木片产量由六十立方公尺提高到八十余立方公尺，适应了日产十六锅的要求。
    早在今年3月份，这个工厂在与石岘造纸厂的竞赛中，少数人认为高产运动会打乱“正常秩序”，违反工艺规程。他们把各种工艺技术规程当作不可侵犯的信条，使工人被动地执行工艺技术规程。厂党委发觉这种倾向以后，即引导工人大争大辩，使全厂职工认清全厂具有很大潜力。大家认为，应该使生产不是按照相互牵制的原则，保持原状；而是按照相互促进的原则，不断发展。因此，今年6月份，全厂纸浆的日产量即由年初的八锅增加到十二锅。
    10月份，厂党委又发动全厂工人大鸣大放，分别讨论和制定了各车间和各工段的指标，使各车间和工段的指标与全厂的统一指标一致，达到“万流归大海，千线成一绳”。在建立新的平衡过程中，又不断地注意车间与车间之间、工段与工段之间、工序与工序之间相互协调，加强薄弱环节。例如，10月份，由于生产能力增长，曾一度使电力供应和蒸汽供应紧张，出现了动力与生产不平衡的现象。厂党委立即发动工人们动手建起四座小型电站，锅炉工段也改进了操作方法，使供电量和供汽量迅速增加。于是，动力车间和生产车间之间在更高的水平上重新建立了平衡。
    目前，开山屯造纸厂的群众运动正在深入发展，使平衡日产十六锅的生产能力巩固起来，并进一步发动群众大搞两段蒸煮的尖端技术，向日产三十二锅化学纸浆的方向努力。
