    Secondary Technical School Creates Airplane
    "Red Flag No. 1" Manufactured by Beijing Aviation Industrial School Takes to the Skies
    (Our Report) Beijing Aviation Industrial School, in implementing the Party's educational policy, has designed and manufactured its own "Red Flag No. 1" agricultural multi-purpose aircraft, which has taken to the skies. This afternoon, a test flight ceremony was held at the Capital's Western Suburbs Airport.
    More than 6,000 people, including all teachers and students of the school, representatives of relevant units assisting in the manufacture of the aircraft, and guests, attended the test flight ceremony. Kang Sheng, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Zhong Fuxiang, Deputy Commander of the Naval Aviation Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Major General Zeng Kelin, and Soviet experts attended the test flight ceremony and spoke at the meeting. Comrade Kang Sheng cut the ribbon for the ceremony.
    In his speech, Comrade Kang Sheng said: It is a major event that a secondary technical school, under the leadership of the Party, can design and manufacture an aircraft that takes to the skies. However, in modern aviation industrial science, it is a small event, a small object. He instructed the teachers and students not to be arrogant, to learn basic theoretical knowledge well, and to make better, more, and more cutting-edge aircraft in the future. He also said in his speech that the success of "Red Flag No. 1" is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Party and government and Soviet experts, and we express our heartfelt gratitude. Finally, he encouraged the teachers and students to continue their efforts and advance to the peak of science!
    In his speech, Minister Yang Xiufeng hoped that Beijing Aviation Industrial School and other schools would further integrate teaching, productive labor, and scientific research even better, better implement the Party's educational policy, and strive for greater achievements!
    The "Red Flag No. 1" aircraft, except for the engine and instruments which were manufactured in the Soviet Union, was designed and manufactured by the teachers and students themselves in 115 days of hard work with the assistance of relevant units, under conditions of weak technical strength and simple equipment. The average age of the more than 360 students, teachers, and workers who participated in the design and manufacture was less than 21 years old. However, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the "three-way combination" of teachers, students, and workers overcame various difficulties and finally made the aircraft take to the skies.
    "Red Flag No. 1" is a single-engine, high-wing, tail-boom aircraft with a maximum flight speed of 180 kilometers per hour, a maximum flight altitude of 4,000 meters, and an effective payload of 450 kilograms. It is an agricultural multi-purpose aircraft that can be used for pest control, fertilization, sowing, and short-distance transportation and rescue in agriculture. It can also be used for short-distance passenger transport or as a skydiving aircraft.
    Zhang Xingyuan, the pilot who had previously test-flown the "Flying Dragon No. 1" and "Yan'an No. 1," served as the test pilot for "Red Flag No. 1" today. He flew an "8" pattern at an altitude of more than 350 meters, then swept over the cheering crowd. After the plane landed, Zhang Xingyuan reported to the assembly: The flight conditions were good.

    中等技术学校造出了飞机
    北京航空工业学校制造的“红旗一号”上天
    本报讯  北京航空工业学校在贯彻执行党的教育方针中，自己设计、制造的“红旗一号”农业多用途飞机上天了。今天下午在首都西郊飞机场举行了试飞典礼大会。
    参加试飞典礼的有该校全体师生和协助制造这架飞机的有关单位代表、来宾等六千多人。中共中央政治局候补委员康生、教育部部长杨秀峰、第一机械工业部副部长钟夫翔、中国人民解放军海军航空司令部副司令员曾克林少将、以及苏联专家等人参加了试飞典礼，并在会上讲了话。典礼由康生同志剪彩。
    康生同志在讲话中说：一个中等技术学校，在党的领导下，能设计、制造出飞机上天是一件大事情。但是，在现代航空工业科学上他又是一件小事件、小物件。他指示师生们不要骄傲，学好基础理论知识，今后做出更好的、更多的、更尖端的飞机。他在讲话中还说，“红旗一号”的上天，与苏联党和政府、苏联专家的帮助分不开的，我们表示衷心感谢。最后，他勉励师生们继续努力，向科学高峰前进！
    杨秀峰部长在讲话中，希望北京航空工业学校和其他学校，都要进一步使教学、生产劳动和科学研究更好地结合起来，更好地贯彻执行党的教育方针，争取更大的成绩！
      “红旗一号”飞机，除发动机和仪表是苏联制造的以外，师生们是在技术力量薄弱，设备简陋的情况下，经过一百一十五天的奋战，在有关单位协助下，自己设计和制造成功的。参加设计和制造的三百六十多名学生、教师和工人，平均年龄还不到二十一岁。但是，在党委领导下，教师、学生、工人“三结合”，克服了种种困难，终于使飞机上了天。
    “红旗一号”是一架单发动机、上单翼尾撑式飞机，最大飞行速度为每小时一百八十公里，最大飞行高度为四千公尺，有效载重量是四百五十公斤。它是一架农业多用途飞机，可用于农业上除虫害、施肥、播种和短途运输、救护等，也可用作短途客运或作跳伞运动机。
    不久前，曾试飞过“飞龙一号”和“延安一号”的飞行员张兴远，今天担任“红旗一号”的试飞员。他驾机在三百五十公尺以上高空飞了一个“8”字形，然后从欢呼的人群上空掠过。飞机着陆后，张兴远向大会报告：飞行情况良好。
