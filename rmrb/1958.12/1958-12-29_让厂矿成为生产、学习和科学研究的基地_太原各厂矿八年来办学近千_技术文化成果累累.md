Let Factories and Mines Become Bases for Production, Learning, and Scientific Research
Taiyuan Factories and Mines Have Run Nearly a Thousand Schools in the Past Eight Years, Accumulating Rich Technical and Cultural Achievements

(Our report) In the more than 300 factories and mines in Taiyuan City, schools of all levels and types have blossomed everywhere. A large number of intellectuals from the working class are growing, and they have become an important force in the cultural revolution and the technological revolution.

Taiyuan City's factories and mines have had an eight-year history of running schools. Since the Great Leap Forward in production, many more schools have been established, some run by factories, others by workshops and work sections. According to statistics from 89 factories and mines, nearly a thousand vocational primary schools, vocational middle schools, vocational universities, and junior and secondary technical schools have been established. Most factories and mines have also established a complete educational system from primary school to university. 140,000 people have entered various types of schools run by factories and mines, with enrolled employees accounting for 75% of the total number of employees. Due to the diligent study and hard work of the broad masses of employees, their cultural level has been improving year by year. Many workers have become working-class intellectuals with both rich production experience and a certain level of political, scientific, and cultural knowledge. According to statistics, in 1950, the number of illiterate employees in the city accounted for 33% of the total number of employees, and no workers attended universities or senior high schools. Now, more than 54,000 people have been freed from illiteracy, accounting for 95% of the total number of employees, those with a primary school education account for 68.6% of the total number of employees, those with a secondary school education have reached 24.9% of the total number of employees, and many people have a cultural level equivalent to that of college students.

The large number of working-class intellectuals cultivated by factories and mines in Taiyuan City have become an important force in the cultural revolution and the technological revolution. Some of them have taken on leadership positions at the factory, workshop, and work section levels, some have become production backbones, and some have become engineers, technicians, and technical personnel. More than 5,000 employees in the Taiyuan Cement Factory and the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory have been promoted in technical grade, and 384 people have been promoted to factory management cadres. Many workers are constantly innovating technology in production. After many workers in the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory mastered cultural, scientific, and technical knowledge, they have been able to independently solve some technical problems. Wang Zhenhua, deputy director of production in the forging and riveting workshop of this factory, originally had only a junior primary school education. Because he insisted on studying culture, he is now able to design, draw, and trial-produce some new products. In the technical innovation movement, he gathered the universalization of steam hammer drills in his workshop, proposed the innovation plan of "ten majorizations" in production, and guided workers to reform technology. Currently, "five majorizations" have been realized. Ruan Chengpu, a worker at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, was originally illiterate, but now he has become a technical innovation expert. He used the principle of physics, the pulley system, to modify the equipment for uninterrupted removal of sleeves, greatly improving production efficiency and increasing the country's steel plate production by 420 tons throughout the year. Jiao Qinghu, a fitter at the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, also modified the three-slot steel tapping and distribution steel rudder tie rod designed by engineering and technical personnel, with very good results.

After factories and mines ran education on a large scale, many factories have become places combining production, education, and scientific research. Workers learn in production practice and also carry out large-scale scientific research activities. They are laborers, students, and also scientific researchers. The Shanxi Machine Tool Factory established seven academies of sciences (design institutes), 49 scientific research institutes (design institutes), more than 400 red and expert technical research groups, and more than 30 experimental factories throughout the factory. The topics researched by these scientific research organizations include "Atomic Tracking Control Electric Furnace Problems," "Trial Manufacturing Technology of 1,200-Ton and 5,000-Ton Hydraulic Presses," and "New Machine Tool Design," among hundreds of others. Currently, workers have researched, designed, and assembled "Oil-Impregnated Bearings," "Long-Distance Control of High Temperature," and other projects. The more than 3,000 employees participating in scientific research activities are all students of the factory's middle school and university. Workers Zhang Yueyun and Xu Wenzhu recently designed a hobbing machine, which, after being appraised by engineers, was found to be fully compliant with specifications, saving more than 140,000 yuan compared to a hobbing machine of the same capacity.

After improving their cultural level, the broad masses of employees often read books on political theory, technology, literature, and art. Workers happily say, "Learning culture opens the eyes, and learning politics opens the mind." Many workers also write poetry, paint, and write books. In recent years, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has attached great importance to the vocational education of employees. In May and July of this year, the Municipal Committee successively held city-wide education conferences to discuss the Party's education policy. In running schools, Party committees at all levels adopted the method of discussing and acting simultaneously, developing and planning simultaneously, and following the mass line. At the same time, the leaders of many units, after calculating, felt that there was a lack of technical strength now, and there would be even more in the future. If they did not cultivate it as early as possible, they would become more and more passive in the future. After the ideological problems were initially resolved, a mass upsurge of running schools appeared throughout the city. At present, each factory and mine, in combination with the actual production situation, is carrying out a series of reforms to the school system, curriculum, and teaching methods, focusing on teaching reform.

    让厂矿成为生产、学习和科学研究的基地
    太原各厂矿八年来办学近千  技术文化成果累累
    本报讯  在太原市三百多个厂矿里，各级各类学校已是遍地开花。大批的工人阶级知识分子正在成长，他们已成为文化革命和技术革命的重要力量。
    太原市厂矿已有八年办学历史，生产大跃进以来，又办起许多学校，有厂办的，也有车间、工段办的。据八十九个厂矿的统计，共办起了业余小学、业余中学、业余大学、初级和中等技术学校近一千所。大部分厂矿还建立起从小学到大学的一套完整的教育体系。有十四万人进入了厂矿办的各级各类学校，入学职工占职工总数的75％。由于广大职工勤学苦练，文化水平逐年提高，许多工人已成为既有丰富的生产经验，又有一定的政治和科学文化水平的工人阶级知识分子。据统计，1950年全市职工文盲人数占职工总数的33％，工人上大学、高中的根本没有。现在，已扫除文盲五万四千多人，占职工总数的95％，小学文化程度的占职工总数的68.6％，中等文化程度的已达到职工总数的24.9％，并有不少人具有大专学校的文化水平。
    太原市厂矿培养出来的大批工人阶级知识分子已经成为文化革命和技术革命的重要力量。他们中有些担任了厂级、车间、工段的领导职务，有的成了生产骨干，有的成了工程师、技师、技术员。太原水泥厂和太原矿山机器厂有五千多个职工提升了技术等级，有三百八十四人提升为工厂管理干部。许多工人在生产中不断革新技术。太原矿山机器厂许多工人掌握文化科学技术知识以后，已经能够独立解决一些技术问题。这个厂锻铆车间生产副主任王振华，原来只有初小文化程度，由于他坚持学习文化，现在已能设计、绘图、试制一些新产品。在技术革新运动中，他汇集了本车间汽锤钻子万能化，提出生产“十大化”的革新方案，并指导工人改革技术，目前已实现了“五化”。太原钢铁公司工人阮成谱，原来一字不识，如今已成为技术革新能手，他运用物理学滑轮组原理，改装了下车不停套的设备，大大提高了生产效率，全年可为国家增产钢板四百二十吨。太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂钳工焦庆虎，还修改了工程技术人员设计的三槽出钢分钢舵拉杆，效果很好。
    厂矿大办教育以后，许多工厂已成为生产、教育、科学研究三结合的场所。工人们在生产实践中进行学习，同时大搞科学研究活动。他们是劳动者，是学生，也是科学研究人员。山西机床厂全厂建立了七个科学院（设计院）、四十九个科学研究所（设计所），四百多个红专技术研究小组，三十多个试验工厂。这些科学研究组织研究的课题有“原子追踪控制电炉问题”、“一千二百吨与五千吨水压机试制技术”、“新型机床设计”等数百个。目前，工人们已经研究设计和装制成功了“含油轴承”“远距离控制高温”等。参加科学研究活动的三千多职工都是这个厂中学和大学的学员。工人张月云和徐文烛最近设计成功了一台滚齿机，经工程师鉴定，设计完全合乎规格，比同样能力的滚齿机节省了十四万多元。
    广大职工在提高了文化水平以后，经常阅读有关政治理论、技术、文艺等书籍。工人们高兴地说：“学了文化开眼睛，学了政治开脑筋。”许多工人还写诗、绘画、著书立说。几年来，中共太原市委一直很重视职工业余教育工作。今年5月和7月，市委连续召开全市教育会议，讨论了党的教育方针。在办学中，各级党委采取了边议论，边行动，边发展，边规划，走群众路线的办法。同时许多单位领导人经过算账，感到现在缺乏技术力量，将来更缺乏，如不及早进行培养，将来愈来愈被动。思想问题初步解决后，全市出现了群众性的办学高潮。目前，各厂矿结合生产实际，以教学改革为中心，对学制、课程、教学方法进行了一系列的改革。（附图片）
