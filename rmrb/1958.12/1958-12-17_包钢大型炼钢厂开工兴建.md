Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 16th. Construction has begun on another key factory of Baotou Steel – the large steel plant. The large open-hearth furnaces under construction in this plant are comparable in scale to Anshan Steel's "King of Open-Hearth Furnaces".

    Currently, the construction workers have excavated a foundation pit, resembling a section of a riverbed, eight meters deep at the main plant's foundation. The reinforced concrete foundation for the first large open-hearth furnace and part of the foundation for the first large mixer furnace have been completed. The foundations for other workshops, such as demolding and mold-making workshops, as well as raw material warehouses, have been partially completed. A tower crane construction equipment, over seventy meters high, has also been installed.

    The workers have decided to carry out rapid construction through vigorous mass movements and technical revolution, striving to complete the civil engineering work for two large open-hearth furnaces, one mixer furnace, and part of the plant buildings in the first quarter of next year, so that steel can be produced soon after the No. 1 blast furnace produces iron.

    The design of this steel plant adopts advanced Soviet technology. Loading, casting, demolding, etc., are equipped with highly mechanized and automated equipment. The production process is controlled by automatic instruments and automatic control equipment. At the same time, China's new technology "three-tap steelmaking" will also be adopted.

    包钢大型炼钢厂开工兴建
    新华社包头16日电  包钢又一座重点工厂——大型炼钢厂已经开工兴建。这个厂建设中的大型平炉，其规模同鞍钢的“平炉之王”相当。
    目前，建厂职工们在主厂房地基上挖好了像一段河床似的八公尺深的基坑，第一座大型平炉的钢筋混凝土基础和第一座大混铁炉部分基础已经做好。其他脱模、整模等车间，以及原料仓库等的基础已经做好了一部分，七十多公尺高的塔式吊车施工设备也安装了起来。
    职工们决定在大搞群众运动和大闹技术革命中开展快速施工，争取在明年第一季度把两座大型平炉、一座混铁炉和部分厂房的土建工程干完，以便在第一号高炉出铁之后不久就可以出钢。
    这个炼钢厂的设计采用了苏联先进技术，装料、铸锭、脱模等，都设有高度机械化自动化设备，生产过程有自动仪表和自动操纵设备来控制，同时还将采用我国的新技术“三槽出钢”。
