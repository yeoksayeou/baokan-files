Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: TASS, Moscow, December 5th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, has sent a telegram congratulating the All-African People's Conference held in Accra. The telegram stated that the convening of this conference demonstrates the increasing unity of the African people in their struggle against colonialism.

Khrushchev emphasized that there is no doubt that the just cause upheld by the African people will surely be victorious.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers sincerely wished the conference success and hoped that this conference would contribute to the further unity of the African people and become a new step in completely liberating Africa from foreign rule.

Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity sent a telegram on December 4th to the All-African People's Conference held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, warmly congratulating the convening of the conference. The telegram reads as follows:

To the All-African People's Conference in Accra:

On the occasion of the convening of the All-African People's Conference in Accra, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity extends its warm congratulations to the conference.

The Chinese people are very excited to see that the heroic African people have achieved greater and greater victories in their struggle for national independence and the end of colonial rule. However, colonialism is still making a dying struggle. They vainly attempt to maintain their bloody rule through cruel suppression and political deception. Neo-colonialism, under various guises, is intensifying its economic plunder and military expansion in Africa, and is trying its best to undermine the African national independence movement, attempting to replace old colonialism and enslave the African people. However, all this cannot save the collapse of the heinous colonial system, nor can it stop the great African people, who are increasingly awakened and united, from moving towards independence and freedom. We believe that the convening of the All-African People's Conference will make a positive contribution to strengthening the unity of the African people, promoting the African national independence movement, and developing friendly cooperation between the Asian and African peoples.

The Chinese people, who have suffered deeply from imperialist oppression, have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the African people for national independence and against colonialism and racial discrimination. In order to oppose our common enemy, the Chinese people will always stand with the African people and do their best to strengthen our friendly cooperation and mutual support. We firmly believe that all imperialist forces will eventually be completely driven out of the African land by the united and struggling African people. Victory will surely belong to the great African people.

                                    Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity
                                  December 4, 1958, in Beijing

    帝国主义必将被逐出非洲
    赫鲁晓夫和中国亚非团结委员会电贺全非人民大会
    新华社5日讯  塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫已经打电报祝贺阿克拉全非人民大会的召开。贺电说，这次大会的召开表明非洲人民在反对殖民主义的斗争中日益团结起来。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，毫无疑问，非洲人民一致维护的正义事业必将取得胜利。
    苏联部长会议主席真诚地预祝大会成功，并且希望，这次大会将有助于非洲人民的进一步团结，将成为使非洲完全摆脱外国统治的新步骤。
    新华社5日讯  中国亚非团结委员会4日打电报给在加纳首都阿克拉举行的全非人民大会，热烈祝贺大会的召开。电文如下：阿克拉全非人民大会：
    值此全非人民大会在阿克拉召开之际，中国亚非团结委员会谨向大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民非常兴奋地看到，英勇的非洲人民在争取民族独立和结束殖民主义统治的斗争中，取得了愈来愈大的胜利。但是，殖民主义还在作垂死的挣扎。它们妄图用残酷镇压和政治欺骗的手段，保持它们的血腥统治。而新殖民主义正在各种伪装之下，加紧对非洲进行经济掠夺和军事扩张，并且竭力破坏非洲的民族独立运动，企图代替旧殖民主义，奴役非洲人民。然而，所有这一切，都无法挽救万恶的殖民主义制度的崩溃，都无法阻挡日益觉醒和团结的伟大非洲人民向独立和自由迈进。我们相信，全非人民大会的召开，将对加强非洲人民的团结、推进非洲的民族独立运动和发展亚非人民之间的友好合作，作出积极的贡献。
    深受过帝国主义压迫之苦的中国人民，一贯同情和支持非洲人民争取民族独立和反对殖民主义、种族歧视的正义斗争。为了反对我们共同的敌人，中国人民将永远同非洲人民站在一起，并且尽力加强我们之间的友好合作和相互支持。我们深信，一切帝国主义势力，终将被团结一致、坚持斗争的非洲人民从非洲土地上全部赶出去。胜利一定属于伟大的非洲人民。
                                    中国亚非团结委员会
                                  1958年12月4日于北京
