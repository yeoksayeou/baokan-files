"Clay Figurine Zhao" Becomes a Teacher

　　"Clay Figurine Zhao," a street performer who carried a small box on his back for more than thirty years, recently attended his first class at the Shanghai Amateur University of Arts and Crafts, Department of Modeling: the historical evolution of clay figurine art.

　　Zhao Kuoming's superb clay figurine skills have long been famous throughout the country. He not only has rich experience, and the clay figurines he makes look like living beings, but they are also crack-proof, moth-proof, and mildew-proof, with a unique style. In order to learn the art of clay figurine making, Zhao Kuoming searched for old artists in Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai to become his masters. However, at that time, "competitors are enemies," and people not only refused to take him as a disciple but also suppressed him. Later, he achieved great success in art and was known as the "King of Clay Figurines" in the north. When he came to Shanghai, he spent a large sum of money to learn the techniques of mixing colors for clay figurines. He worked hard and diligently in this way, developing and creating the art of clay figurine making.

　　The students of the Shanghai Amateur University of Arts and Crafts are workers from four arts and crafts factories and eight handicraft cooperatives. In order to cultivate their skills in manufacturing fine handicrafts, the school hired Zhao Kuoming as a teacher in the Department of Modeling. Zhao Kuoming agreed without hesitation. He is prepared to pass on all his skills to the younger generation of successors.

    “面人赵”当了教师
    背了三十多年小箱子的街头艺人“面人赵”，最近在上海工艺美术业余大学造型系上了第一课：捏面人艺术的历史沿革。
    赵阔明捏面人的高超手艺，早已驰名全国。他不仅有丰富的经验，捏出来的面人像活的一样，而且可以防裂、防蛀、防霉，具有独特的风格。赵阔明当年为了学习捏面人技术，在天津、北京、上海到处找寻老艺人拜为师傅。可是那时“同行是冤家”，人们不但不肯收他为徒弟，反而打击他。后来他在艺术上已有很大成就，在北方被人称为“面人大王”了。他到上海还拿出很大一笔钱去学习调配面人色彩的技巧。他就是这样钻研苦练，发展和创造了捏面人的艺术。
    上海工艺美术业余大学的学生是四个工艺美术工厂和八个手工业合作社的工人们。为了培养他们能制造精良手工艺品的技术，学校聘请赵阔明担任造型系的教师。赵阔明毫不踌躇地答应了。他准备把他的手艺全部交给年青一代的接班人。
