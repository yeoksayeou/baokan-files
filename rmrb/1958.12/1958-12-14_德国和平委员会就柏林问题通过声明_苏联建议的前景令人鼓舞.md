Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 12th: The German Peace Council meeting, which concluded in Berlin on the 12th, adopted several important documents concerning the Berlin and German issues.

The declaration on the Berlin issue adopted by the meeting participants stated that the Soviet government's proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city offers encouraging prospects. As a demilitarized free city, West Berlin would no longer be a center of conspiracies against the peaceful labor and peaceful policies of the German Democratic Republic. The resolution of the Berlin issue will prepare the ground for the establishment of a confederation between the two Germanys and pave the way for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone and the achievement of disarmament agreements. The declaration stated that the German Peace Council hopes that the Soviet proposal will lead to mutual understanding and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The German Peace Council calls on all peace-loving people to carefully study the important documents on the peaceful resolution of the Berlin issue, promote their content, and support their realization.
