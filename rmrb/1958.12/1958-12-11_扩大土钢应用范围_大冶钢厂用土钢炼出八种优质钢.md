    Expand the Scope of Application of Indigenous Steel
    Daye Steel Plant Uses Indigenous Steel to Refine Eight Kinds of High-Quality Steel
    (Our Dispatch) In order to expand the scope of application of indigenous steel, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry assigned two technical personnel from the Black Metallurgy Design Institute and the Iron and Steel Research Institute, along with technical personnel from the Daye Steel Plant, to conduct an experiment at the Daye Steel Plant recently: using indigenous steel to successfully refine eight kinds of high-quality steel, such as high-speed steel, stainless steel, high-manganese steel, and ball bearing steel, as well as three kinds of carbon steel. These trial-refined high-quality steels, after chemical analysis, underwent several mechanical performance tests, and some steel materials were rolled, proving that the quality was up to standard and could be used to manufacture important products or components such as high-speed cutting tools, turbine blades, tractor tracks, electrical equipment, and ball bearings.
    This experiment was conducted in a small electric furnace in the central laboratory of the Daye Steel Plant, using indigenous steel blocks refined in a low-temperature steelmaking furnace in Shangcheng County, Henan. The method involved first melting the indigenous steel, adding carbonizing agents or ferroalloys, and then adding materials such as lime to create slag for smelting.
    The technical personnel from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry who participated in this experiment told reporters upon their return that, judging from the records of this experiment, the procedure for smelting high-quality steel using indigenous steel is simple and the smelting time is short. This experiment is significant for improving the quality of indigenous steel and expanding the variety of indigenous steel, and is particularly important for the development of industry and agriculture in the vast rural areas and small cities. If a county town or people's commune needs a small amount of alloy steel, they can use this method to refine high-quality steel on a small scale in crucibles for manufacturing various more advanced machines and tools.

    扩大土钢应用范围
    大冶钢厂用土钢炼出八种优质钢
    本报讯  为了扩大土钢的应用范围，冶金工业部指派黑色冶金设计院和钢铁研究院的两位技术人员和大冶钢厂的技术人员，最近在大冶钢厂进行了一项试验：用土钢顺利炼出了高速钢、不锈钢、高锰钢、滚珠轴承钢等八种优质钢和三种碳素钢。试炼出来的这些优质钢，经过化学分析，作了几个机械性能的试验，并轧制了一些钢材，证明质量合格，可以用来制作高速切削工具、汽轮机的叶子板、拖拉机履带、电气设备、滚珠轴承等重要产品或部件。
    这次试验，是在大冶钢厂中心试验室的一个小电炉里进行的，用的是河南商城县低温炼钢炉炼出的土钢块。方法是先将土钢溶化，配以增碳剂或铁合金，并加一些石灰等造渣材料，进行冶炼。
    冶金工业部参加这次试验的技术人员归来后对记者说，从他们这次试验的纪录看来，用土钢冶炼优质钢，手续简便，冶炼时间也短。这次试验对提高土钢质量扩大土钢品种是有意义的，特别是对广大农村和小城市的工农业发展具有很大作用。假如一个县城或人民公社需要用少量的合金钢，他们可以用这种方法在坩埚里小规模地炼出优质钢来，用以制造各种较为高级的机械和工具。
