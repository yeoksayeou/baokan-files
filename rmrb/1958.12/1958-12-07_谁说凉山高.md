Who Says Liangshan is High
Who says Liangshan is high?
Who says Liangshan is far?
On the Greater Liangshan, electric poles are planted,
The line workers work day and night.
The mountains are high, but not as high as the electric poles,
The road is far, but not as far as the electric wires.
Electric wires cross ten thousand mountains,
Beijing and Liangshan are closely connected.

    谁说凉山高
    谁说凉山高？
    谁说凉山远？
    大凉山上栽电杆，
    架线工人日夜干。
    山高没有电杆高，
    路远没有电线远。
    电线越过万重山，
    北京凉山紧相连。
