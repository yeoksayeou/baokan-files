Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 9th: Shortly after Iraqi Prime Minister Qassem announced the cracking of a subversive conspiracy case, a large number of telegrams expressing support for the Republic's government action began to pour into the Iraqi capital like snowflakes. These telegrams all demanded that the treasonous criminals be executed.

    So far, more than fifty telegrams with thousands of signatures have been received. These telegrams came from all walks of life, various organizations and groups, including lawyers, doctors, students, members of the People's Resistance Forces, women's groups, teachers, workers and other organizations.

    Telegrams from the Iraqi Women's Rights Defense League and the Bar Association stated that the Iraqi people would never allow any foreigners or traitors to do evil in their country. The telegrams demanded that the government execute these traitors and mobilize the people to defend the Republic.

    The commander of the Fourth Division telegraphed Prime Minister Qassem, saying: "The personnel of our division are ready to crush anyone who dares to endanger our Republic."

    The commander of the Third Division telegraphed Qassem on the evening of the 8th, saying, "We will always be soldiers defending the country, firmly united under your wise leadership, and we would rather die than be divided. We are all loyal defenders of our Republic."

    The Preparatory Committee of the National Union of Students of Iraq called on students to unite, defend the Republic, and demanded that they be vigilant and pay attention to exposing any conspiracies against the Republic.

    The workers' telegrams stated that "Crushing the activities of conspirators is in the interests of the Iraqi people. The workers also demanded that these conspirators be punished."

    A large number of telegrams are still being sent.
