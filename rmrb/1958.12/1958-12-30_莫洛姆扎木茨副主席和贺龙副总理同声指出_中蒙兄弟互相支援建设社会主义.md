He said: "The tremendousachievements made by the Mongolian people under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in developing their country's economy and culture and improving their living standards are inseparable from the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries to our country."

The victories and achievements of the 650 million great Chinese people are the victories and achievements of our socialist camp. The Mongolian people also regard it as their own victory and achievement."

Vice Premier He Long said in his speech at the banquet: "The Chinese and Mongolian peoples are as close as brothers. Our two countries are close neighbors. In the cause of building socialism, the Mongolian people have given our country much support. Similarly, our people have also given friendly assistance to the fraternal Mongolian people. I believe that the results achieved in this meeting will further strengthen the economic relations between China and Mongolia and the friendly unity between the two peoples."

Vice Premier He Long said that the Chinese people are excited to see that the Mongolian people, under the correct leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, have victoriously completed two five-year plans, greatly developed their economic and cultural undertakings, and achieved remarkable results in the first year of the three-year plan. Vice Premier He Long said: "The Chinese people, who are in the great leap forward of socialist construction, feel as happy about every achievement made by the Mongolian people as they do about their own achievements. Undoubtedly, the brilliant achievements made by the Mongolian people will further strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces defending world peace.
