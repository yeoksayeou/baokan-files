Western "Unity" Exists in Name Only, Division is Reality

    The internal contradictions of the imperialist camp are numerous. Their so-called "unity" is in the process of gradually moving towards its opposite, that is, gradually moving towards disintegration. This process may be quite long, but the general trend is inevitable.
                      -- Communiqué of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    The West has been clamoring about the myth of so-called "Western unity," and Dulles has been particularly vocal. But what kind of "unity" is this? The United States wants its large and small partners to be "united" under American control, "united" under the atomic bomb, demanding that they be obedient and kowtow in submission. Therefore, this so-called "unity" is bound to move towards its opposite: disintegration.

    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting currently being held in Paris is full of fierce open and secret struggles. The United States is first challenged by "allies" such as France and West Germany for leadership. Here, there is de Gaulle's demand to establish a "big three core"; there are demands from West Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Nordic countries to strengthen "political consultations"; and within the US-UK alliance, there is also the proposal by British Field Marshal Montgomery to replace the American general who is the current Supreme Commander of the "Allied Forces" with a European, and to move the Military Committee from Washington to Paris. This is a deepened "leadership crisis" after the United States suffered repeated failures in its military aggression in the Middle East and the Taiwan region under the new situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind.

    At the same time, the centrifugal tendencies of the entire group are becoming more and more serious. The United States wants to establish medium-range missile bases in its European "allies," but so far only Britain and Italy have agreed. Denmark and Norway have openly refused.

    The Paris meeting will also encounter the difficult problem of military "unification." The United States is attempting to establish medium-range missile bases in France and demanding the "merger" of the Central European Air Force fighter squadrons, that is, to put French fighters under the command of American General Norstad. But France has not agreed and is still deadlocked. In addition, West Germany demands that the Danish and Norwegian troops under the Nordic Command be handed over to the Central European Command led by a West German general, in an attempt to control the troops in Central and Northern Europe, but this is opposed by Denmark. The two sides had a quarrel at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Parliamentary Conference not long ago.

    The trade war in the Western world, in which each side wants to drown the other, is also unfolding fiercely. The "Common Market" composed of six Western European countries, including West Germany, France, and Italy, is in a white-hot conflict with the "Free Trade Area" plan formed by Britain and other Western European countries. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd has already shouted: if Western economic "cooperation" is broken, "military and political cooperation" cannot be "completely preserved." The economic war is intensifying the impact on the weak dike of "Western unity."

    On many other issues, especially on the redistribution of spheres of influence, the contradictions and differences within the imperialist camp are exposed one after another. At the end of last year, the United States and Britain unilaterally transported weapons to Tunisia, undermining France's position in North Africa. And this year, the United States and Britain took advantage of the French bombing of Tunisia, using "mediation" as a pretext to further squeeze out France. The result was the emergence of a de Gaulle, whose representative of the extremely reactionary colonial forces, upon taking office, has been trying his best to maintain its colonial empire and unite with West Germany to fight back against the United States and Britain.

    In addition, there is an increasingly fierce struggle between Britain, Turkey, and Greece, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, over the Cyprus issue. Britain disregards the rights of the Greek residents on the island of Cyprus to demand autonomy and carries out cruel suppression. Greece demands self-determination for Cyprus. Turkey demands partition. Under Britain's instigation, relations between Turkey and Greece are deteriorating. The United States is operating behind the scenes, wanting to turn Cyprus into a base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to control it.

    The United States is increasingly intensifying its squeeze on the old colonialist forces of Britain and France in the Far East, the Middle East, and Africa, causing fierce competition between them.

    In short, "Western unity" is like a disease-ridden body, with sores bursting out everywhere, and cracks appearing everywhere. These cracks will continue to widen with the decline of the capitalist West.

### 西方“团结”其名分裂是实

    西方“团结”其名分裂是实
    帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重，他们的所谓“团结”，正在处于逐步走向反面即逐步走向四分五裂的过程中，这个过程可能还相当长，但是总的趋势是不可避免的。
                      ——中共八届六中全会公报
    西方一直在叫嚷所谓“西方团结”的神话，杜勒斯叫得特别响。但是，这是怎么样的“团结”呢？美国是要它的大小伙伴“团结”在美国的控制之下，“团结”在原子弹下，要求他们服服贴贴，磕头称臣。因此，这种所谓“团结”，必然要走向它的反面：四分五裂。
    正在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议，就充满着激烈的明争暗斗。美国首先遭到法国、西德等“盟国”争夺领导权的挑战。这里，有戴高乐建立“三巨头核心”的要求；有西德、意大利、加拿大和北欧国家的加强“政治磋商”的要求；而在美英联盟中，又有英国元帅蒙哥马利提出的以欧洲人代替“目前盟军”最高司令的美国将军，把军事委员会从华盛顿搬到巴黎等主张。这是在东风压倒西风的新形势下，美国在中东、台湾地区的军事侵略连遭失败后，加深了的“领导危机。”
    与此同时，整个集团的离心倾向也越来越严重。美国要在欧洲“盟国”建立中程导弹基地，但是迄今只有英国和意大利两个国家同意，丹麦和挪威已公开拒绝了。
    这次巴黎会议还将碰到军事“统一”的难题。美国企图在法国建立中程导弹基地，并要求“归并”中欧空军战斗机队，也就是要把法国战斗机归由美国将军诺斯塔德指挥。但法国一直没有答应，还在僵持中。另外，西德要求把北欧司令部辖下的丹麦和挪威军队交给由西德将军领导的中欧司令部指挥，企图使它控制中欧和北欧的部队，但是遭到丹麦的反对。不久前在北大西洋集团议员会议上双方曾经吵过一场。
    西方世界中要把对方淹死的贸易战，也激烈展开起来。以西德、法国、意大利等西欧六国组成的“共同市场”为一方和英国伙同其他西欧国家组成的“自由贸易区”计划为另一方，正在进行着白热化的冲突。英国外交大臣劳埃德已经叫喊：如果西方在经济上的“合作”被打破，“军事政治合作”就不能“完整无缺的保存下来”。经济战正在加剧着对“西方团结”的薄弱堤防的冲激。
    在其他许多问题上，特别是在势力范围的重分上，帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾和分歧一个接连一个地暴露出来。去年年底美英擅自向突尼斯运送武器，挖了法国在北非的墙脚。而今年美英两国又利用法军轰炸突尼斯的事件，以“斡旋”为名，进一步排挤法国。结果逼出了一个戴高乐，这个极端反动的殖民势力的代表一上台就竭力企图保持它的殖民帝国，并联合西德向美英进行反击。
    此外，在塞浦路斯问题上北大西洋集团成员国英国、土耳其和希腊之间进行着日益激烈的斗争。英国无视塞浦路斯岛上希腊居民要求自治的权利，并进行残酷的镇压。希腊要求塞浦路斯实行自决。土耳其则要求实行分治。在英国的挑拨下，土耳其和希腊的关系日益恶化。美国则在幕后活动，想把塞浦路斯变为北大西洋集团的基地，以便加以控制。
    美国在远东、中东和非洲地区日益加紧排挤英法等旧殖民主义势力，引起了它们之间的剧烈竞争。
    总之，“西方团结”有如百病俱发，脓疮四破，到处在出现裂痕。这种裂痕将随着资本主义西方的没落而不断扩大开来。
