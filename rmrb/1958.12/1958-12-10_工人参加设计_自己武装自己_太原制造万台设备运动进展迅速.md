    Workers Participate in Design, Arm Themselves
    Taiyuan's 10,000-Equipment Manufacturing Movement Advances Rapidly
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 9th dispatch) The upsurge of the 10,000-machine manufacturing movement centered on the manufacturing of metallurgical equipment in various machinery manufacturing plants in Taiyuan City has formed a climax. By the end of November, more than 5,000 sets of various large-scale mechanical equipment have been completed. The city-wide campaign to manufacture 10,000 machines before the end of the year was proposed by the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in early November. According to the requirements of the Municipal Party Committee, each factory has disclosed the situation of insufficient production capacity to the workers. The broad masses discussed this situation and unanimously believed that waiting for the state to allocate a large number of machines and equipment was unrealistic. They must arm themselves. After repeated discussions, the workers of the state-owned Jinxi Machine Factory quickly formed a mass movement to ensure complete sets of rolling mills and power equipment. They proposed: "Mobilize all employees of the factory, work hard and skillfully for fifty days, manufacture three thousand sets of machines and equipment, and celebrate the victory to welcome the New Year." The workers of this factory launched a competition with various large machinery factories in the city, which was immediately responded to by the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, and Shanxi Machine Factory. The Shanxi Machine Factory decided to organize three "battles" to ensure that 1,288 sets of mechanical equipment orders would be completed in the forty-five days from the second half of November to the end of the year. Many machine repair departments have also broken the superstition that repair shops cannot manufacture machines, and are building equipment in a big way to arm themselves.
    The mass movement in Taiyuan's machinery factories was carried out under the leadership of the Party committee from the very beginning. In the mass movement, the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory completely changed the past method of relying solely on a few technicians to design and compile processes behind closed doors, abolished some unreasonable systems in design, approval, and drawing, and stipulated a new system of "self-planning, self-designing, and self-manufacturing." After the design, process, and inspection rights were basically delegated to workshops and groups, the workers established seven design institutes, forty-nine research institutes, hundreds of red and expert groups, and more than thirty amateur processing plants under the leadership of the Party committee. According to the needs of completing this year's tasks and increasing next year's tasks, they designed and manufactured more than 400 sets of various new machine tools within a month. Technicians in the eighth workshop of this factory spent more than two months modifying the 1616 lathe without results, but this time the workers designed and modified it in only three days.

    工人参加设计  自己武装自己
    太原制造万台设备运动进展迅速
    本报太原9日电  太原市各机械制造厂掀起的以制造冶金设备为中心的万台机械制造运动，已形成高潮。到11月底已完成各种大型机械设备五千多台。全市开展年前制造万台机械设备运动，是中共太原市委在11月上旬提出来的。按照市委的要求各厂都把生产能力不足的情况向职工交“底”，广大群众讨论了这个情况一致认为等待国家给调拨很多机器设备是不现实的。必须自己动手武装自己。国营晋西机器厂职工经过反复讨论，很快形成以保证轧钢机、动力设备成套的群众运动。他们提出：“全厂职工总动员，大干巧干五十天，机器设备三千台，庆祝胜利迎新年”。这个厂职工向全市各个大型机器厂提出竞赛，立即得到山西机床厂、太原矿山机器厂、山西机器厂的响应。山西机器厂确定组织三次“战役”，保证11月下半月到年底的四十五天中，突击完成一千二百八十八台机械设备的订货任务。许多机械修理部门也破除了修理厂不能制造机器的迷信，大造设备，武装自己。
    太原市各机械厂大搞群众运动一开始就是在党委领导下进行的。山西机床厂在群众运动中彻底改变了过去只靠少数技术人员闭门搞设计、编工艺的方法，取消了在设计、审批、制图等方面的一些不合理的制度，规定出“自己规划、自己搞设计、自己制造”的新制度。设计、工艺、检验权基本下放到车间、小组后，职工群众在党委领导下成立了七个设计院、四十九个研究所、数百个红专小组和三十余个业余加工厂。他们根据完成今年任务和明年任务加大的需要，在一个月内设计、制造出四百多台各式各样的新机床。这个厂第八车间技术人员修改1616型车床，忙了两个多月还没有结果，这次工人动手设计只用了三天就修改好了。
