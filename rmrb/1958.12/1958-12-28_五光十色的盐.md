Sea salt is a white cubic crystal. Seawater (containing about 2.5% salt) is introduced into salt fields, and solar heat energy is used to evaporate the seawater into brine. When the brine reaches 25 degrees on the Baumé scale (an instrument for measuring the salinity of seawater brine), it crystallizes into salt. Sea salt has many uses, such as for consumption, pickling non-staple foods, seed selection, feeding livestock, and composting fertilizer. After industrial electrolysis, it can be made into soda ash, caustic soda, polyvinyl chloride, chloroprene rubber, 666 DDT, and bleaching powder. Ammonium chloride and granular fertilizers also require salt. Sulfa drugs, camphor, borneol, and terramycin also use salt as a raw material. The construction sector can use salt water for antifreeze in winter construction. This year, some new uses for salt have been added, such as the use of caustic soda, lime, and salt as solution materials in indigenous steelmaking methods.

Lake salt is a yellow-black irregular lump that is mined from open-air salt lakes. In China, there are large salt lakes in Qinghai and Inner Mongolia. The salt in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province alone can supply the people of the whole country for more than 10,000 years. Its uses are the same as sea salt.

Well salt is produced by drilling wells to extract brine from underground salt domes and then boiling it using natural gas or coal. Due to different boiling methods, it is divided into "Ba salt" and "Flower salt." Ba salt is a gray-black lump, while flower salt is a white powder crystal. Its uses are the same as sea salt.

Mineral salt comes in the most shapes, including vermicelli salt, pearl salt, salt stalactites, and crystal salt. Most of it is mined from mountains. Transparent crystal salt can not only be carved into various exquisite works of art, but can also be used as a lens for nighttime high-altitude infrared photography.

Earth salt is made by scraping soil from alkaline land, leaching it for brine, and then drying (or boiling) it. It can be used to extract mirabilite or as agricultural fertilizer.

Processed salt is made by dissolving crude salt into brine and then boiling it in flat pans or vacuum tanks. It is mainly used for food and industry.

Seawater, well brine, salt mines, and salt lakes also contain large amounts of various inorganic salts and metals. More than 100 types have been trial-produced in various places this year, including potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, mirabilite, magnesium sulfate, bromine, borax, iodine, and magnesite, as well as various rare elements.

    五光十色的盐
    海盐是白色立方的结晶体，把海水（含盐2.5％左右）引进盐田，利用太阳热能把海水蒸发成卤，卤水到波美表（测量海水卤水含盐度的仪表）二十五度时就结晶成盐。海盐的用途很多，如食用、腌制副食品、选种、喂牲口、沤肥料等；经过工业电解之后，可以制成纯碱、烧碱、聚氯乙烯、氯丁橡胶、六六六滴滴涕、漂白粉；氯化铵和颗粒肥料也需要盐；磺胺、樟脑、冰片、土霉素等药品也要用盐作原料；建筑部门冬季施工可以用盐水防冻。今年增加了一些盐的用途，如土法炼钢要用烧碱、石灰和盐做溶液料等。
    湖盐是黄黑色不规则的块状物，是从露天盐湖中开采出来的。在我国青海、内蒙古都有很大的盐湖，仅青海省柴达木盆地的盐，可供全国人民食用一万余年。用途和海盐同。
    井盐是钻井吸取地下盐丘中的卤水，利用天然气或煤煎制成盐。由于煎制方法不同，又分“巴盐”和“花盐”两种。巴盐是灰黑色的块状物，花盐是白色粉末结晶。用途和海盐同。
    矿盐的形状最多，粉条盐、珍珠盐、盐硔石、水晶盐都是矿盐。多数是在矿山中采掘出来的。透明的水晶盐不但可雕刻成各种精巧的艺术品，还可以用作夜间高空红外线照相镜头。
    土盐是在碱土地带，刮土淋卤，晒（或煎）制成的。可以提制芒硝或做农业肥料。
    加工盐就是把粗盐化成卤，用平锅或真空罐煎成的。主要是用于食用和工业方面。
    在海水、井卤水、盐矿和盐湖中，还蕴藏着大量的各种无机盐和金属物。今年各地试制的有一百多种，其中主要的有氯化钾、氯化镁、芒硝、硫酸镁、溴、硼砂、碘、镁砂等，还有各种稀有元素。
