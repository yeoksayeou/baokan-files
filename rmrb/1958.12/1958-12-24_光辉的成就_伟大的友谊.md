    Glorious Achievements, Great Friendship
    Liu Lantao, Head of the Chinese Laboring People's Delegation to the Soviet Union for the 41st Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Entrusted by the people of the whole country and carrying the profound friendship of the Chinese people for the Soviet people, we went to our great ally, the Soviet Union, to participate in the grand celebration of the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. During our twenty-three days in the Soviet Union, we received meticulous care and fraternal, warm reception from all sectors of Soviet society. We participated in the celebration of the 41st anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the solemn and grand holiday parade in Moscow. We visited Moscow, Leningrad, and the capitals of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Minsk, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kiev. We toured many factories, collective farms, schools, and museums, and had extensive contact with our Soviet brothers and sisters—workers, farmers, and intellectuals. Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, received us and had a cordial and friendly conversation with us.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are marching towards communism. The glorious achievements they have made in industrial and agricultural construction and cultural and scientific undertakings, their lofty spirit of internationalism, and their ardent love and affection for the Chinese people have deeply moved us and left us with unforgettable and profound impressions.
    We witnessed with our own eyes in various parts of the Soviet Union the magnificent strides of the Soviet people in building communism and their spirit of diligent labor. In Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, and Kiev, large-scale urban construction is proceeding at a rapid pace everywhere. Many giant factories with world-advanced equipment and a high level of technology are constantly producing new products. The male and female workers there are operating advanced automated equipment with creative labor and skilled techniques, engaging in high-speed production. Across the Soviet Union, industrial production in the first ten months of this year increased by 10% compared to the same period last year, and production plans for various important industrial products have been fulfilled or overfulfilled. The Soviet Union's current industrial output is thirty-six times that of pre-revolutionary Russia, and the industrial products produced in every ten days are equivalent to the entire annual output of Russia in 1913. We also saw in Ukraine and Belarus the Soviet Union's vast farmlands, abundant agricultural products, and plump livestock. Soviet agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, with the purchase of 3.5 billion poods of grain, greatly exceeding the amount purchased in the bumper year of 1956. We also saw that with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the material and cultural life of the Soviet people is becoming more affluent and beautiful. In 1958, the real wages of workers and staff increased almost twofold compared to 1940, and the real income of farmers increased more than twofold. Because of increased people's income and increased purchasing power, the total volume of retail trade in the Soviet Union has increased by more than 20% in the past two years. We saw in the several cities we visited that department stores were always packed with customers. Housing construction in the Soviet Union is also developing on a large scale. The total area of residential buildings for urban residents this year is 62 million square meters, and large residential areas are being built in Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, and Kiev. Minsk was more than 80% destroyed by the German fascists in the Patriotic War, but in just over a decade, it has now become a brand new city that is more prosperous and more beautiful than before the war. National education has been popularized in the Soviet Union, and the number of people receiving various types of education has reached 50 million.
    We also saw in the Soviet Union the pinnacle of world science and technology. We visited the three artificial satellites on display in Moscow. The Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite is still rotating in the sky today, marking that the Soviet Union has far surpassed the United States in science and technology. We also boarded the nearly completed atomic icebreaker named after the great Lenin, which is another outstanding achievement of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy. We firmly believe that under the banner of the great Lenin, the Soviet people will be able to break through all obstacles and overcome any difficulties, just like the atomic icebreaker, and move forward courageously in all aspects of communist construction!
    During our visit to the Soviet Union, we happened to encounter the announcement by the Central Committee of the CPSU of the "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965." This great plan, which cheered progressive people around the world and shocked imperialists and all reactionaries, unfolded before us a magnificent and majestic picture of communism. The "important task" of this plan is "to vigorously develop various economic sectors and vigorously strengthen the country's economic potential on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, so as to ensure the continuous improvement of the people's living standards." Its salient feature is to enable the Soviet Union "to enter a new and most important stage of development—the period of carrying out the construction of a communist society." According to this plan, by 1965, the level reached by the Soviet Union's important industrial and agricultural products will be: steel 86-91 million tons, steel products 65-70 million tons, oil 230-240 million tons, electricity generation 500-520 billion kilowatt-hours, grain output 10-11 billion poods, and meat (calculated by slaughtered weight) no less than 16 million tons. In seven years, the real income of employees will increase by an average of 40%, and the income of collective farmers will also increase by at least 40%. Employees will only work six or seven hours a day, and will have two days off each week. In seven years, the Soviet Union's national capital construction investment will be almost equal to the total investment in national economic construction in all previous years since the establishment of the Soviet regime. This is a powerful sign of a great leap forward towards communism.
    The new seven-year plan is also a construction program for the Soviet people to overwhelm all imperialism in peaceful competition with a heroic spirit. The result of the implementation of this plan will enable the Soviet Union to take a decisive step in establishing the material and technical basis of communism and realizing the basic economic tasks of the Soviet Union. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in the report outline: "After the completion of the seven-year plan, the Soviet Union will surpass the current production level of the most developed capitalist countries in Europe—Britain and West Germany—in terms of industrial product production per capita and rank first in Europe. By 1965, the Soviet Union will surpass the current industrial production level of the United States in the absolute output of some of the most important products, and will approach the current industrial production level of the United States in the output of other products. By that time, the production of the most important agricultural products as a whole will exceed the current level of the United States in terms of per capita calculation. The advantage of the Soviet Union in the growth rate of production will create a realistic basis for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita production level in about five years after 1965. It can be seen that by that time, or even earlier, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world in terms of both the absolute value of production and the output calculated per capita, which will guarantee that residents have the highest living standards in the world. This will be a victory of world historical significance for socialism in its peaceful competition with capitalism."
    The Soviet Union is the center of the unity of our socialist camp and the international communist movement, a powerful fortress for maintaining world peace, and the most loyal and reliable friend of all oppressed and exploited nations. The completion of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for national economic development will not only greatly enhance the power of the Soviet Union, but also further greatly strengthen the power of the entire socialist camp and the force for defending world peace. The socialist system will not only have an absolute advantage over the capitalist system in terms of the overall balance of power and in the balance of the speed of production development, but also in terms of the simple balance of economic power. The victory of the entire socialist cause, the cause of human progress, and the cause of world peace will all be given a new and greater guarantee as a result. The announcement of the Soviet Union's great seven-year plan has made the socialist camp and progressive people around the world extremely happy and elated, while causing imperialism to be panic-stricken and dejected, which is a natural result. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan is a bright red flag fluttering in the wind, and it will once again prove that the development of socialism cannot be stopped by any force!
    We saw with our own eyes in the Soviet Union that, in order to welcome the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the heroic Soviet people have already launched a significant communist labor competition movement in the discussion of the seven-year plan. This movement was initiated by the workers of the Moscow Sorting Station, where the first voluntary labor Saturday began forty years ago. Lenin participated in voluntary labor here forty years ago and wrote his famous book "A Great Beginning." Now, in all the Soviet republics, industrial centers, construction sites, and vast rural areas, the number of "Communist Labor Teams" is increasing, and the competition movement is developing more and more widely. The slogan of the workers and farmers participating in the competition is: to work, study, and live with a communist spirit and attitude. They propose that they not only strive to rapidly increase labor productivity, but also ensure the continuous improvement of their cultural and technical level, master the latest technologies and production procedures, master several professional skills, and at the same time fight against old ideas and completely subordinate their own interests to the interests of society. The Communist Youth League youth work team at the Angara River Bratsk Hydropower Station construction site has exceeded the quota by more than one time each month, and now proposes to master a second professional skill and complete seven years of work in five years. Coal miners of the famous Mamai work team in Donbass have put forward new initiatives for tapping production potential. They decided to over-extract an average of 2.5 tons of coal per person per work shift before the end of this year and throughout 1959, and reduce the cost of each ton of coal by 1.5 rubles. Not only many miners responded to this initiative, but also workers in other industrial sectors across the country. The enthusiasm, creativity, and infinite youthful vitality shown by the Soviet people in construction is the loudest response to the seven-year plan put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and it is also the fundamental guarantee for the realization of this plan. We believe that no force in the world can stop the heroic Soviet people's magnificent pace towards communism.
    Our people, like people all over the world, feel infinite excitement and encouragement about this huge step taken by the Soviet Union towards communism. We firmly believe that, just as the Soviet Union's several five-year plans have been successfully completed and over-fulfilled in the past, the Soviet people will definitely successfully complete and over-fulfill the new plan this time, and in the near future, they will definitely leave the most developed capitalist country in the world, the United States, far behind. We wish the Soviet people new and greater achievements in communist construction!
    The Soviet people will always be a brilliant example for our people and the proletarians and working people of all countries to learn from. The brilliant today of the Soviet people is the happy tomorrow of the working people of the world. The heroic Soviet people, with their living example, show mankind the bright historical future opened up by the Great October Socialist Revolution, and encourage the proletarians and working people of the world to march victoriously along the path of the October Revolution with full confidence. Over the past forty-one years, the tremendous influence of the October Revolution on human history has become more and more obvious day by day, and the new world opened up by the October Revolution has become more and more prosperous and powerful day by day. In the year since the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become more united and stronger, the workers' movement in various countries has developed more widely, and the movement to defend peace, oppose war, and strive for national independence has become more surging; while the imperialist camp headed by the United States has fallen into a new and deeper crisis, its internal contradictions have become more acute, and it is increasingly heading towards its dying days, increasingly exposing that they are just paper tigers. The East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind, and the days of imperialism's death are not far away!
    In our visit, the Soviet brothers and sisters we came into contact with were very concerned about the situation of China's construction and the life of the Chinese people. They cheered for the great leap forward in our country's construction cause, and regarded our victory as their own victory. Countless Soviet-Chinese Friendship Associations have been established in various Soviet republics, cities, large and small, factories, and schools, and the propaganda activities of Soviet-Chinese friendship are widespread and in-depth. In the kindergarten attached to a factory in Kiev, every children's activity room is also decorated with Chinese children's pictures, introducing the life of Chinese children to Soviet children. Not long ago, all parts of the Soviet Union solemnly celebrated the 9th anniversary of the founding of China, and now many places have already begun preparations for celebrating the 10th anniversary of China's National Day. For example, the Belarusian National Opera and Ballet Theatre specially invited writers and actors from our delegation to hold a discussion in order to prepare to perform the opera and ballet "The White-Haired Girl" on October 1 next year. Several of the factories we visited were producing machinery and equipment for China. For example, the Leningrad Metal Factory, the Minsk Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and the Kiev Precision Electrical Instrument Factory. The employees there regard supporting China's construction tasks as their own personal undertaking, and regard undertaking this task as the greatest honor. They repeatedly expressed to us: "As long as Chinese brothers have needs, we will definitely contribute all our experience and strength." When we visited various cities, we encountered hundreds and thousands of our students and interns, who received universal love and help from Soviet teachers, classmates, and worker brothers. The Soviet people are training construction talents for China in the same way as training their own experts. Many Soviet people expressed to us that in the Chinese people's struggle against the US imperialism's occupation of China's territory Taiwan, Comrade Khrushchev's powerful warning to US imperialism of "an encroachment on China is an encroachment on the Soviet Union" truly expressed what was in their hearts. They said: "If US imperialism does not stop, we are ready to fight alongside you at any time!" The Soviet people's lofty spirit of internationalism of sharing weal and woe with the Chinese people deeply moved us. Wherever we went in the Soviet Union, the Soviet people we came into contact with, whether gray-haired old people or innocent children, all had ardent love for us, and we were often moved by this infinite affection. The unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is built on the great Marxist-Leninist internationalist foundation. The lofty and ardent friendship of the Soviet people cultivated by the great Lenin and the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union made us feel that even though we were visiting the Soviet Union in the early winter with snow flying, we were living in the sunny and bright spring. During our twenty-odd days in the Soviet Union, we were all immersed in the warmth of this spring.
    The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and the friendship and unity between the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, are the most fundamental guarantee for the victory of the common socialist cause and the cause of world peace. We went to the Soviet Union with the Chinese people's gratitude and love for the great Soviet people, and now we are returning to the motherland full of the Soviet people's deep friendship for our people. We firmly believe that this visit will further strengthen the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Although we have left the Soviet Union, the hearts of our entire Chinese people will always be united with the Soviet people! Finally, let us wholeheartedly wish the great Soviet people new and greater achievements in the construction of communism, wish the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union even more prosperity and strength, and wish the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples will last forever!

    光辉的成就  伟大的友谊
    中国劳动人民庆祝十月革命四十一周年赴苏观礼团团长  刘澜涛
    我们受全国人民的委托，带着中国人民对苏联人民的深厚友谊，到伟大的盟邦——苏联去参加庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十一周年的盛典。我们在苏联的二十三天中，受到苏联各方面人士无微不至的关怀和亲如手足的热情接待。我们在莫斯科参加了伟大十月社会主义革命四十一周年的庆祝会和庄严隆重的节日观礼，访问了莫斯科、列宁格勒以及白俄罗斯共和国的首都明斯克和乌克兰共和国的首都基辅，参观了许多工厂、集体农庄、学校和博物馆，同苏联的兄弟姊妹——工人、农民和知识分子进行了广泛的接触。苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志接见了我们，同我们作了亲切而友好的谈话。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，正在向共产主义迈进。他们在工农业建设和文化科学事业等方面所取得的光辉的成就，他们的崇高的国际主义精神和对中国人民炽热的友爱和情谊，使我们受到极大的感动，留下了难忘的深刻的印象。
    我们在苏联各地亲眼看到了苏联人民建设共产主义的雄伟步伐和勤奋的劳动精神。在莫斯科、列宁格勒、明斯克和基辅，到处都在以飞快的速度进行着规模宏大的城市建设。许多有世界先进的设备和高度的技术水平的巨型工厂，正不断地出产着崭新的产品。那里的男女工人们都以创造性的劳动和熟练的技能操纵着自动化的先进设备，从事高速度的生产。就全苏联来说，在工业生产方面，今年头十个月的产量比去年同时期增长了10％，各种重要工业产品都完成或超额完成了生产计划。苏联现在的工业产量为革命前俄国的三十六倍，每十天当中生产的工业产品就等于1913年俄国全年的产量。我们在乌克兰和白俄罗斯也看到了苏联辽阔无边的农田、丰富的农产品和肥硕的牲畜。苏联的农业生产今年获得了空前的丰收，采购的谷物达到三十五亿普特，大大地超过了丰收的1956年采购的数量。我们也看到，随着工农业生产的发展，苏联人民的物质生活和文化生活更加富裕和美好。在1958年，工人和职员的实际工资比1940年几乎增加一倍，农民的实际收入增加了一倍以上。因为人民收入增加，购买力提高，最近两年来苏联零售贸易总额增加了20％以上。我们在所到的几个城市看到，百货商店总是顾客盈门。苏联的住宅建设也有大规模的发展，今年城市居民住宅建筑总面积是六千二百万平方公尺，在莫斯科、列宁格勒、明斯克和基辅都正在兴建着大片大片的住宅区。明斯克在卫国战争中被德国法西斯破坏了80％以上，不过十年多一点的时间，现在已经变成了崭新的比战前更加繁荣更加美丽的城市。苏联的国民教育已经普及，现在受着各种教育的人数达到五千万。
    我们在苏联还看到世界科学技术方面的高峰。我们在莫斯科参观了陈列着的三颗人造卫星。苏联的第三颗人造地球卫星今天还在天上旋转，它标志着苏联在科学和技术方面已经远远地超过美国。我们也曾经登上了即将竣工的以伟大列宁命名的原子破冰船，这是苏联在和平利用原子能方面所获得的又一卓越的成就。我们深信，苏联人民在伟大列宁的旗帜下，在共产主义建设的一切方面，都将像原子破冰船一样，能够冲破重重障碍，战胜任何困难，乘风破浪地前进！
    在我们访问苏联的期间，恰好遇到苏共中央公布“1959年—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”。这个使全世界进步人类欢欣鼓舞，使帝国主义和一切反动派震惊的伟大计划，在我们面前展开了一幅瑰丽雄伟的共产主义的图景。这个计划的“重要任务是在优先发展重工业的基础上，大力发展各个经济部门，大力加强国家的经济潜力，以保证人民生活水平的不断提高”。它的显著的特点，是使苏联“进入到一个新的最重要的发展时期——开展共产主义社会建设的时期”。按照这个计划，到1965年，苏联的重要工农业产品达到的水平是：钢八千六百—九千一百万吨，钢材六千五百—七千万吨，石油二亿三千—二亿四千万吨，发电量五千—五千二百亿度，谷物产量一百—一百一十亿普特，肉类（按屠宰重量计算）不少于一千六百万吨。七年中，职工实际收入平均增加40％，集体农民的收入也将至少提高40％。职工每天将只作六、七个小时工作，而且每周将有两个休息日。七年中苏联国家基本建设投资额，几乎等于苏维埃政权建立以来历年国民经济建设投资额的总和。这是以飞跃的速度向共产主义大踏步前进的有力的标志。
    新的七年计划，也是苏联人民以豪迈的英雄气概在和平竞赛中压倒一切帝国主义的建设纲领。执行这个计划的结果，将使苏联在建立共产主义的物质技术基础，以及实现苏联的基本经济任务方面，迈进决定性的一步。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告提纲中指出：“七年计划完成以后，苏联在按人口计算的工业品生产上将超过目前欧洲最发达的资本主义国家——英国和西德的现有生产水平而居欧洲第一位。到1965年，苏联在某些最重要的产品绝对产量上将超过美国目前的工业生产水平，而在其他产品产量上将接近美国目前的工业生产水平。到那时候，整个农业最重要产品的生产在按人口计算上将超过美国现在的水平。苏联在生产增长速度方面的优势将造成现实的基础，使苏联在1965年以后大约五年内在按人口平均计算的生产水平上赶上并超过美国。由此可见，到那时候，也可能还早一些，苏联无论在生产的绝对产值方面，或者在按人口平均计算的产量方面，都将居世界第一位，这样就将保证居民具有世界上最高的生活水平。这将是社会主义在同资本主义和平竞赛方面具有世界历史意义的胜利。”
    苏联是我们社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动团结的中心，是维护世界和平的强大堡垒，是一切被压迫被剥削民族最忠实最可靠的朋友。苏联国民经济七年计划的完成，不仅将大大地增强苏联的威力，而且将进一步大大地加强整个社会主义阵营的威力和保卫世界和平的力量。社会主义体系对资本主义体系不但在总力量对比方面，在生产发展速度的对比方面，将占有绝对的优势，而且在单纯的经济力量对比方面，也将占有绝对的压倒的优势。整个社会主义事业、人类进步事业和世界和平事业的胜利，都将因此而获得新的更大的保证。苏联伟大的七年计划的公布，使社会主义阵营和全世界进步人类高兴异常，欢欣鼓舞，而使帝国主义惊慌万状，垂头丧气，乃是当然的结果。苏联的七年计划，是一面迎风招展的鲜艳红旗，它将再一次证明，社会主义的发展是任何力量都不能阻挡的！
    我们在苏联亲眼看到，英雄的苏联人民为了迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会，在讨论七年计划中已经掀起了一个意义重大的共产主义劳动竞赛运动。发起这一运动的，是四十年前开始第一个义务劳动星期六的莫斯科调车站的工人们。四十年前列宁曾在这里参加过义务劳动，并且写出了他的名著“伟大的创举”。现在，在苏联所有的加盟共和国、工业中心、建筑工地和广大农村中，“共产主义劳动队”的数目越来越多，竞赛运动日益广泛开展。参加竞赛的工人和农民的口号是：用共产主义精神和态度来劳动、学习和生活。他们提出：不但要争取迅速提高劳动生产率，而且要保证不断提高文化和技术水平，掌握最新的技术和生产工艺规程，掌握几种职业技能，同时还要同旧的思想作斗争，使自己的利益完全服从社会的利益。安加拉河布拉次克水电站建设工地的共青团青年工作队，每月都超额完成定额的一倍以上，现在又提出要掌握第二种专业技能，在五年内完成七年的工作任务。顿巴斯著名的马马伊工作队的采煤矿工提出挖掘生产潜力的新倡议，他们决定在今年年底以前和1959年全年在每个工作班内，每人平均超额开采二点五吨煤，把每吨煤的成本降低一点五卢布。响应这个倡议的不仅有很多矿工，而且有全国各地其它工业部门的工人。苏联人民在建设中所表现出来的积极性、创造性和无限的青春活力，是对苏联共产党提出七年计划的最响亮的回答，也是实现这个计划的根本保证。我们相信，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡英雄的苏联人民向共产主义前进的雄伟步伐。
    我国人民和全世界人民一样，对于苏联走向共产主义这个巨大的步骤，感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。我们深信，像过去苏联的几个五年计划都胜利完成和超额完成一样，苏联人民这一次也一定会胜利完成和超额完成新的计划，在不久的将来，一定会把世界上最发达的资本主义国家——美国，远远地抛在后面。我们预祝苏联人民在共产主义建设中取得新的更伟大的成就！
    苏联人民永远是我国人民和世界各国无产阶级和劳动人民学习的光辉的榜样。苏联人民灿烂的今天，就是全世界劳动人民幸福的明天。英雄的苏联人民以活生生的榜样，给人类昭示着伟大十月社会主义革命所开辟的光明的历史前途，鼓舞着全世界无产阶级和劳动人民信心百倍地沿着十月革命的道路胜利前进。四十一年来，十月革命对人类历史的巨大影响一天比一天更加明显，十月革命所开辟的新世界一天比一天更加繁荣和强大。各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议后的一年来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加团结和壮大，各国工人运动更加广泛发展，保卫和平、反对战争、争取民族独立的运动更加高涨；而以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，则陷入了新的更深刻的危机，它的内部矛盾更加尖锐，它日益走上日暮途穷，愈来愈暴露他们不过是纸老虎。东风正在进一步压倒西风，帝国主义死亡的日子不远了！
    在我们参观访问中，接触到的苏联兄弟姊妹们，都非常关怀中国建设的情况和中国人民的生活。他们为我国建设事业的大跃进而欢呼，把我们的胜利当作他们自己的胜利。苏联各加盟共和国、各大小城市和工厂、学校建立的苏中友好协会不计其数，中苏友好的宣传活动普遍而深入。基辅一个工厂所附设的幼儿园，每一个儿童活动室也都挂有中国的儿童图片，把我国儿童的生活情形介绍给苏联儿童。不久以前，全苏联各地曾经隆重地庆祝中国建国九周年，现在有不少地方已经在开始作庆祝中国国庆十周年的准备。例如白俄罗斯国立歌舞剧院，为了准备在明年10月1日演出歌舞剧“白毛女”，专门邀请我们代表团里的作家和演员举行座谈。我们这次参观的工厂，就有好几处是为中国生产机器设备的。例如，列宁格勒的金属工厂、明斯克的汽车制造厂、基辅的精密电气仪表厂等。那里的职工们把支援中国的建设任务当作自己的切身事业，以担当这种任务为最大的光荣。他们一再向我们表示：“中国兄弟只要有需要，我们一定贡献出自己的全部经验和力量”。我们在各城市访问时，遇到成百成千的我国留学生和实习生，他们受到苏联广大教师、同学和职工弟兄们普遍的爱护和帮助。苏联人民像培养自己的专家一样为中国培养着建设人材。许多苏联人民向我们表示，在中国人民反对美帝国主义侵占中国领土台湾的斗争中，赫鲁晓夫同志对美帝国主义提出的
  “侵犯中国就是侵犯苏联”的有力警告，真正说出了他们心里的话。他们说：“如果美帝国主义不罢手的话，我们随时准备同你们并肩作战！”苏联人民对中国人民这种同呼吸共命运的崇高的国际主义精神，深深地感动了我们。我们在苏联所到的地方，所接触到的苏联人民，不论是白发苍苍的老人或天真烂漫的儿童，都对我们怀着炽热的友爱，我们经常为这种无限的深情所感动。中苏两国人民牢不可破的友好和团结，是在伟大的马克思列宁主义的国际主义基础上建立起来的。在伟大的列宁和光荣的苏联共产党所培养下的苏联人民崇高的炽烈友情，使我们虽在瑞雪纷飞的初冬访问苏联，也感觉是生活在阳光普照的明媚春天。我们在苏联的二十几天里，遍身都浸透了这种春天的温暖。
    中苏两国人民的友好和团结，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国间的友好和团结，是社会主义共同事业同世界和平事业取得胜利的最根本的保证。我们带着中国人民对伟大的苏联人民的感谢和热爱到了苏联，现在又满载着苏联人民对我国人民的深情厚谊回到祖国来了。我们深信，经过这次访问，对中苏两国人民的友好和团结必将进一步加强。我们虽然离开了苏联，但我们全中国人民的心永远是和苏联人民结合在一起的！最后让我们衷心地祝伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义中获得新的更伟大的成就，祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国更加繁荣昌盛，祝中苏两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万古长青！
