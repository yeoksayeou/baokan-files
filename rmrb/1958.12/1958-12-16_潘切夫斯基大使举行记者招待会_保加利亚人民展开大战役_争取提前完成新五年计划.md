Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Ambassador Panchevski of Bulgaria held a press conference in Beijing this afternoon, and delivered a speech on the issue of the Bulgarian people striving to complete the third five-year (1958-1962) plan for the national economy in three to four years.

Ambassador Panchevski said to the dozens of Chinese and foreign reporters attending the press conference: "We are striving to reach the period of gradual transition to communism as soon as possible. In this struggle, the decisive battle is that we must achieve an economic leap forward in the next few years. That is, to complete the five-year plan in three to four years in terms of total output and national income."

In his speech, Ambassador Panchevski gave a detailed introduction to the content of the third five-year plan for the development of the national economy proposed by the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party. He vividly described the situation of the entire Bulgarian people responding to the party's call and struggling to realize the five-year plan ahead of schedule.

When talking about the basis and conditions for realizing the five-year plan ahead of schedule, Ambassador Panchevski said: "We and our country are not isolated in this great battle. Our loyal brothers, comrades and defenders—the powerful Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and all other socialist brother countries—are with us. With their help, we can conquer any fortress. We are working together with them to strive for the triumph of socialism and communism."

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: In order to strive to complete the third five-year plan in three to four years, Bulgaria is launching a mass movement to build water conservancy projects and expand irrigation areas throughout the country.

Various regions have built many water conservancy projects with local funds. In November alone, the country built 322 small reservoirs and ponds, 259 pumping stations and wells, and dug 2,859 kilometers of canals, which are expected to irrigate 243,049 decares (each decare is equal to 1.5 mu) of land.

The plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held in October and November this year called on Bulgarian agricultural cooperatives to overfulfill the plan for expanding irrigation areas in the third five-year plan, and called on them to increase the area of irrigated land from the previously stipulated 6 million decares to 10 million decares.

The working people of Bulgaria enthusiastically responded to this call and actively participated in water conservancy construction. Ivanov, First Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Electricity and Water Conservancy of Bulgaria, recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters that from November this year to May next year, Bulgaria will irrigate 1.5 million decares of land, which is about three times more than the irrigated area during Bulgaria's bourgeois rule.

Ivanov said that usually, farmers do not work in the fields in winter. However, this year all cooperatives decided not to take a break. On December 2nd alone, despite the bad weather, 252,823 cooperative members participated in agricultural work.

So far, the Bulgarian government has sent 850 soil improvement experts to various parts of the country to conduct on-the-spot research and help cooperatives formulate work plans for building reservoirs and improving soil.

    保加利亚人民展开大战役
    争取提前完成新五年计划
    新华社15日讯  保加利亚驻华大使潘切夫斯基今天下午在北京举行记者招待会，就保加利亚人民争取在三、四年内完成国民经济第三个五年（1958—1962）计划的问题发表了谈话。
    潘切夫斯基大使向出席招待会的几十名中外记者说：“我们正在争取早日到达逐步向共产主义过渡的时期。在这个斗争中，有决定性意义的战役就是：必须在最近几年内实现经济上的跃进。它就是在总产量和国民收入方面，在三、四年内完成五年计划。”
    潘切夫斯基大使在谈话中详细介绍了由保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会提出的发展国民经济第三个五年计划的内容。他生动地叙述了保加利亚全体人民响应党的号召，为提前实现五年计划而斗争的情况。
    潘切夫斯基大使在讲述提前实现五年计划的基础和条件时说：“我们和我们的国家在这场伟大的战斗中不是孤立的。我们忠实的兄弟、同志和保卫者——强大的苏联、中华人民共和国和所有其它社会主义兄弟国家同我们在一起，有了它们的援助，我们能够攻克任何堡垒，我们正同他们一起齐心协力为社会主义和共产主义的凯旋而奋斗。”
    据新华社索非亚讯  保加利亚为了争取在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划，正在全国范围内开展一个兴修水利、扩大灌溉面积的群众运动。
    各地用地方资金兴修了许多水利工程。仅在今年11月一个月中，全国就修建了三百二十二个小型水库和池塘，二百五十九个抽水站和井，挖了二千八百五十九公里长的水渠，预计可以灌溉二十四万三千零四十九狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）的土地。
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会今年10月和11月间召开的全会上曾号召保加利亚农业合作社超额完成第三个五年计划中的扩大灌溉面积计划，号召它们将灌溉土地的面积从以前规定的六百万狄卡尔增加到一千万狄卡尔。
    保加利亚的劳动人民热烈响应了这个号召，积极投入兴修水利工作。保加利亚电力和水利部第一副部长伊凡诺夫最近在接见新华社记者时说，从今年11月到明年5月，保加利亚将灌溉一百五十万狄卡尔的土地，大约比保加利亚在资产阶级统治时期的灌溉面积多三倍。
    伊凡诺夫说，通常，农民在冬季里都不下田工作。但是，今年所有合作社都决定不歇工。仅在12月2日一天，虽然天气很坏，还有二十五万二千八百二十三个合作社员参加农业工作。
    到现在为止，保加利亚政府已派出八百五十名土壤改良专家到全国各地进行实地研究，帮助合作社制定建造水库和改良土壤的工作计划。
