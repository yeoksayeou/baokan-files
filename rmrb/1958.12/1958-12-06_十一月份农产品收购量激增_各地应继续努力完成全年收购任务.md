Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The procurement of agricultural products nationwide achieved a great victory in November. This month's vigorous mass procurement campaign has created favorable conditions for fulfilling the annual procurement task. The current task is to continue to exert great effort and conscientiously implement a realistic approach, striving to basically complete the annual procurement task by the end of December.

In November, the country procured a total of 44.5 billion catties of grain, exceeding the total procurement volume of the four months from July to October. As of the end of November, 64.2% of the annual grain requisition task had been completed. Nearly 20 million dan of cotton were procured this month, equivalent to the procurement volume of September and October, with 62% of the annual cotton procurement task completed. The procurement of 9 million head of live pigs in November was also greater than the procurement volume in any of the previous ten months of this year. In addition, the procurement of flue-cured tobacco, jute, ramie, and hemp also made great progress this month.

Since the issuance of the "Emergency Directive on Vigorously Completing the Task of Procuring and Transporting Agricultural Products" by the CCP Central Committee and the State Council in late October, a mass procurement campaign unfolded vigorously in most provinces and autonomous regions in early November. In many provinces and regions, hundreds of thousands of people participated in the campaign, forming an unprecedented upsurge in harvesting and selling agricultural products. By mid-November, the procurement volume of various agricultural products reached the highest peak in history. The average daily collection of grain was nearly 2 billion catties, and cotton was more than 600,000 dan, with the amount procured rising in a straight line. Since the last ten days of the month, the campaign has gradually developed in a deeper and more solid direction. Many regions have not only paid attention to the progress of procurement, but also to verifying figures, completing procedures, and ensuring quality. Provinces such as Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, and Henan have recently launched inspections of agricultural product procurement work from top to bottom. In the inspection of grain and cotton in Henan Province, a method of inspecting, rectifying, and transporting at the same time was adopted. If quality problems were found during the inspection, immediate sun-drying was carried out. At the same time, weighing, acceptance, and verification of figures were carried out; some places combined the verification of figures with short-distance transportation, weighing and transporting the produce at the same time. Now, 37 counties and cities in the province have completed the task of grain collection and transportation while conducting a general survey. The financial and trade leading departments of Zhejiang Province require that all grain entering warehouses in the province must be inspected, weighed, priced, and stored separately. Grain that has not undergone these procedures cannot be counted as being in storage. At the same time, all counties are required to seize sunny days to organize threshing and sun-drying to ensure that the grain quality meets the standards. At present, many counties in the province have set off a high tide of threshing and sun-drying.

The processing and transportation of agricultural products progressed relatively slowly in the first and middle ten days of November, becoming the two weakest links, but the progress has begun to accelerate since the last ten days of the month. The average daily processing of seed cotton in the last ten days was 328,000 dan, more than double that of the middle ten days. Some areas have begun to strengthen the transportation of seed cotton, and technological innovations have been carried out in cotton processing plants, greatly improving processing efficiency. With the strong support of the railway and transportation departments, the transportation of agricultural products also further improved in the last ten days of November. The transportation volume of grain in the last ten days increased by 21% compared with the middle ten days, cotton increased by 45%, and live pigs increased by 18%. Due to the improvement in transportation, the supply of grain, non-staple foods, and industrial raw materials in some cities has improved to varying degrees compared with October.

What issues should continue to be paid attention to in the procurement, processing, and transportation of agricultural products? A responsible person from the relevant departments of the State Council told reporters today that the procurement of agricultural products should continue to thoroughly implement the principle of combining regular procurement with intensive procurement; while procuring more, procuring quickly, procuring well, and procuring sufficiently, efforts should be made to ensure complete procedures, clear accounts, qualified quality, and accurate figures. Areas that have completed or are nearing completion of the procurement task should conduct a major inspection, major cleanup, and major settlement of accounts; areas that have not completed the task should also pay attention to these issues while carrying out the procurement work, and should strengthen leadership over these tasks and establish some necessary systems.

The responsible person said that in the procurement work, attention should also be paid to correctly handling the relationship between the state and the people's communes. The needs of the state and the people's communes should be considered in an overall and reasonable manner. All parts left to the people's communes according to state regulations should be left to the people's communes; all parts that should be procured by the state should be procured by the state. Grain should be guaranteed to be completed according to the state's requisition and purchase tasks. After the state procurement plan has been completed, if the people's communes continue to request sales, the state should meet the communes' requirements for sales, but attention should also be paid to not buying excessive grain. In addition to the portion left to the people's communes according to state regulations, the portion of economic crops that the state needs to control should be procured by the state.

In terms of material transportation, the responsible person from the relevant departments of the State Council specifically requested all regions to do a good job in the intensive transportation of commercial materials around December 10th. He requested that all regions quickly organize forces to concentrate the materials that need to be transported to the railway lines, so that the goods are waiting for the trains, not the trains waiting for the goods. However, for fresh and live commodities, timely transportation must be ensured, because these materials are prone to death, injury, spoilage, and decay, and should not be stored at the station for too long. Therefore, the organization of these commodities must be particularly meticulous. Commercial departments and railway departments should strengthen cooperation and strive to ensure that they are transported as soon as they arrive, so that neither the trains wait for the goods nor the goods wait for the trains. For fresh and live commodities that cannot be transported temporarily, the feeding and storage work should be strengthened to reduce deaths and losses.

The responsible person finally said that although the procurement of agricultural products nationwide achieved great results in November, there is still a certain distance compared with the annual task. At present, the agricultural product procurement campaign has been launched nationwide, the autumn harvest has basically ended, and winter water conservancy projects have only started in some areas. It is very necessary and possible for all regions to seize this gap and strive to basically complete the procurement task of this year's agricultural products in December under the principle of "taking steel as the key link." It should be seen that if the state cannot complete the agricultural product procurement plan in a timely manner, it will inevitably affect industrial production, exports, and the supply of materials to cities and industrial and mining areas, and will also affect the income of members of the people's communes and the capital accumulation of the communes. Therefore, on the basis of the achievements already made in November, all regions must not only exert great effort, but also be down-to-earth and strive to complete the annual procurement task of agricultural products.

### 十一月份农产品收购量激增  各地应继续努力完成全年收购任务

    十一月份农产品收购量激增
    各地应继续努力完成全年收购任务
    新华社5日讯  11月份全国农产品采购工作取得了巨大的胜利。这一个月轰轰烈烈的群众性的收购运动，已经为完成全年收购任务创造了良好的条件。目前的任务是要继续鼓足干劲并认真贯彻实事求是的作风，为争取12月底基本完成全年农产品收购任务而奋斗。
    11月份全国共收购粮食四百四十五亿斤，超过了7月到10月这四个月的收购总和，截至11月底全年粮食征收任务已经完成64.2％；这个月收购棉花近二千万担，相当于9、10两个月的收购量，全年棉花收购任务已经完成62％；11月份收购生猪九百万头，也比今年前十个月中任何一个月的收购量都大。此外烤烟、黄麻、苎麻、大麻的收购工作，这个月都有很大的进展。
    自从10月下旬中共中央和国务院发出“关于突击完成农产品收购调运任务的紧急指示”后，在11月上旬，一个群众性的收购运动就在全国大部分省、自治区蓬勃展开，不少省、区投入运动的达数百万人，形成了空前未有的采摘和交售农产品的热潮，到11月中旬各项农产品的收购量都达到了历史上的最高峰，这一旬平均日收粮食近二十亿斤，棉花六十多万担，收购数量成直线上升。下旬以来运动则逐渐向深入、扎实的方向发展，不少地区不但注意收购进度，而且注意核实数字、办清手续、保证质量。黑龙江、湖北、湖南、山东、河南等省最近都自上而下地对农产品收购工作展开了检查。河南省在对粮食、棉花的检查中，采取了边查、边整、边集运的方法，通过检查发现质量上有问题，立即进行翻晒处理，同时进行过秤、验收、核实数字；有的地方把核实数字和短途运输相结合，一面过秤，一面运走。现在这个省已有三十七个县、市在普查的同时，完成了粮食集运任务。浙江省财贸领导部门要求全省入仓粮食一定要做到检验、过磅、作价和分仓保管，没有经过这些手续的，不能算入库；同时要求各县抓紧晴天组织脱粒晒粮，保证粮质符合标准。目前这个省的不少县已掀起脱粒晒粮高潮。
    农产品的加工、调运工作，11月上、中旬进展比较迟缓，成为两个最薄弱的环节，下旬以来进度已开始加快。下旬平均每天加工籽棉三十二点八万担，比中旬增加一倍多。部分地区开始加强了对籽棉的运输，并且在棉花加工厂中开展了技术革新，使加工效率大大提高。农产品的调运工作由于铁路和交通部门的大力支持，11月下旬也进一步好转。粮食下旬的调运数量比中旬增加21％，棉花增加45％，生猪增加18％。由于调运情况的好转，部分城市的粮食、副食品和工业原料的供应情况比10月份有不同程度的改善。
    当前农产品收购、加工、调运等方面应该继续注意一些什么问题？国务院有关部门负责人今天对本社记者说，当前农产品的收购工作应该继续彻底执行经常收购与突击收购相结合的原则；在多收、快收、收好、收足的同时，要努力做到手续完备、账目清楚、质量合格、数字确实。目前已经完成或接近完成收购任务的地区，应当进行一次大检查、大清理、大结账；没有完成任务的地区，也要在进行收购工作的同时注意这些问题，并且要加强对这些工作的领导，和建立一些必要的制度。
    负责人说，在收购工作中还应该注意正确处理国家同人民公社的关系，对于国家和人民公社的需要，应该统筹兼顾、合理安排。凡是按照国家规定留给人民公社的部分都应当留给人民公社；凡是应该由国家收购起来的部分，都应该由国家收购起来。粮食应该按照国家的征购任务保证完成，在完成了国家收购计划以后，如果人民公社继续要求出售，国家应该满足公社出售的要求，但是也要注意不要买过头粮。经济作物除了按照国家规定留给人民公社的部分以外，国家需要掌握的部分都应该由国家收购起来。
    在物资调运方面，国务院有关方面负责人特别要求各地做好12月10日左右的商业物资突击运输工作。他要求各地迅速组织力量把需要运输的物资集中到铁路沿线，要使货等车，不要让车等货。但是对于鲜活商品要做到及时调运，因为这类物资易死、易伤、易腐、易烂，在车站上积存时间不宜过久，因此对于这类商品的组织工作要特别细致，商业部门和铁道部门要加强协作，努力做到随到随运，既不使车等货，也不要让货等车。对于暂时不能运走的鲜活商品，要加强饲养、保管工作，可能减少死亡和损失。
    负责人最后说，虽然11月份全国农产品收购工作取得了很大的成绩，但是和全年任务相比，还有一定的距离。目前农产品收购运动已经在全国范围内展开，秋收已基本结束，冬修水利工程还只在部分地区动工，各地抓紧这个空隙，在“以钢为纲”的原则下，力争在12月内基本上完成今年农产品的收购任务，是十分必要也是可能的。应该看到国家如果不能及时地完成农产品收购计划，就必然影响工业生产、影响出口和城市、工矿区的物资供应，同时也会影响到人民公社社员的收入和公社的资金积累。因此各地必须在11月份已有成绩的基础上，既要鼓足干劲，又要踏踏实实，为完成全年农产品的收购任务而奋斗。
