The Italian Emperor Emeritus

"Did Fanfani suspend the duties of two important officials? Did President Gronchi write a strongly worded letter to President Eisenhower in April 1957? Is Fanfani trying to gain political support from the Socialist group headed by Nenni?..." Are these a series of aggressive questions posed to Prime Minister Fanfani by Italian parliamentarians during a debate in the Italian parliament? No, these are questions raised in an article written by an American journalist in the American "New York Times."

Why is this American journalist so aggressively questioning these purely Italian domestic affairs? It turns out that Italy has recently shown some "neutralist" tendencies and is somewhat relaxing its relations with the North Atlantic bloc. So this journalist wrote an article to put some pressure on them. However, the Italian government issued a "bitter denial." So this journalist wrote a second article raising "sharp" questions.

I wonder if the Italian government will issue another "bitter denial" this time. However, after reading this American journalist's article, the Italian people may realize a truth: Is the United States Italy's so-called "ally"? Or is it a domineering emperor emeritus riding on Italy's head?

    意大利人的太上皇
    “范范尼是否停止了两个重要官员的职务？格隆基总统在1957年4月是否写了一封致艾森豪威尔总统的措词激烈的信件？范范尼是否在设法得到以南尼为首的社会党集团的政治支持？……”。这一连串咄咄逼人的问题是在意大利议会辩论中意大利议员向总理范范尼发出的质询吗？不，这是一个美国记者在美国“纽约时报”写的一篇文章中提出的问题。
    这些纯属意大利内政的问题何劳这位美国记者如此气势汹汹地来发问呢？原来，据说意大利最近有些“中立主义”倾向，有些放松同北大西洋集团的关系。于是这位记者写了一篇文章压了一下。但是给意大利官方“刻薄的否认”了。于是这位记者又写了提出“尖锐”质问的第二篇文章。
    不知这回意大利官方是否再出来“刻薄的否认”了。不过看了这位美国记者的这篇文章倒可以使意大利人民悟出点道理来：究竟美国是意大利的所谓“盟友”呢？还是强横霸道骑在意大利头上的太上皇？
