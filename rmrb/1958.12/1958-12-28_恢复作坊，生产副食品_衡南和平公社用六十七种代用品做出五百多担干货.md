Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 27th: Hengnan County's Heping (Peaceful) People's Commune in Hunan Province, while doing a good job in industrial and agricultural production, is vigorously restoring and developing workshops such as oil presses, flour mills, and tofu workshops, and developing non-staple food processing businesses, with great results.

The Heping Commune is a high-yielding rice and bean area in Hengnan County, and the Quanjin town under the commune's jurisdiction is a well-known workshop area. Bean oil, tofu, and fuzi wine are famous far and wide. This year, due to the concentration of leadership on industrial and agricultural production, leadership over non-staple food production was relaxed, so some oil presses and flour mills were once suspended. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the Commune Party Committee determined at the end of September to restore workshops and vigorously grasp non-staple food production while doing a good job in agricultural production. At that time, some cadres and the masses believed that the tasks of industrial and agricultural production were heavy, and vigorously engaging in non-staple food production would affect industrial and agricultural production; moreover, they believed that since it was non-staple food, it was dispensable, and it was okay to eat it, and it was okay to do without it. In order to unify ideological understanding, the Commune Party Committee organized cadres and the masses to launch a debate. Through the debate, everyone understood that if only a few major productions were grasped and non-staple food production was relaxed, the state's commodity procurement plan could not be fully completed, which would affect the supply of materials to urban industrial and mining areas; at the same time, it would also reduce the commune's cash income and fail to meet the needs of the members' further improvement in living standards.

On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, the Commune Party Committee strengthened its leadership over non-staple food production and decided to have the Party Committee Secretary take the lead in mobilizing the masses to find ways to rectify and restore the original wineries, oil mills, tofu workshops, and other workshops. In order to solve the problems of labor and raw materials, the Commune Party Committee and the masses decided after consultation to unify the deployment of labor on various fronts and arrange it reasonably. With the exception of individual veteran masters and technicians, the remaining methods of substituting women for men, the old for the strong, and the weak for the strong were adopted, and 13% of the labor force was adjusted from the entire commune to specialize in sideline production and non-staple food processing. In terms of raw materials, in addition to making full use of materials such as beans, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins produced by the commune, measures were also taken to substitute wild products for domestic products, by-products for genuine products, and miscellaneous grains for staple foods. Over the past two months, the entire commune has mobilized the masses to find more than 10,000 catties of wild plants such as tuckahoe, Actinidia arguta, black tree learning, sesame leaves, and mulberry leaves from the mountains, made them into liquid sugar, boiled them into wine, and squeezed them into oil, and also purchased nearly a thousand dan of taro, pumpkin, potatoes, green onions, garlic, etc., and processed them into various kinds of sugar pastries. The non-staple food processing plant run by the commune's grain department used sweet potatoes to boil more than 3,000 catties of baijiu with a proof of 50 to 80, used sweet potatoes to boil sugar, mixed with ash flour to make more than 100 kinds of biscuits, and processed them into starch, vermicelli, and rice noodles. At the same time, tofu was made from sweet potatoes plus 70% soybeans. From the end of October to the present, the entire commune has used 67 kinds of substitutes to make more than 500 dan of dried goods. In addition to meeting local daily supplies, a batch of non-staple foods has also been transferred to supply industrial and mining areas in other places and the Jingguang Railway double-track construction site.

After vigorously developing non-staple food processing and production, the remaining bean dregs, sugar residue, wine residue, and sweet potato residue have also increased, which has added new feed to livestock and poultry, promoting the fattening of pigs, chickens, and ducks. In November alone, the entire commune transferred 570 fat pigs, 350 dan of chicken and duck eggs, and 1,010 dan of fresh fish, greatly increasing the commune's cash income.

    恢复作坊，生产副食品
    衡南和平公社用六十七种代用品做出五百多担干货
    据新华社长沙27日电  湖南衡南县和平人民公社在搞好工农业生产的同时，大力恢复和发展油坊、粉坊、豆腐坊等作坊，开展副食品加工业务，收获很大。
    和平公社是衡南县的稻豆丰产区，公社所辖的泉溪镇又是有名的作坊区，豆油、豆腐和孚子酒是远近闻名的。今年由于领导力量集中到工农业生产上，放松了对副食品生产的领导，因此有些油坊、粉坊一度停顿下来了。人民公社成立以后，公社党委9月底即确定在搞好农业生产的同时，恢复作坊，大抓副食品生产。当时曾有部分干部和群众，认为工农业生产任务重，大搞副食品生产会影响工农业生产；而且认为既然是副食品，就可有可无，有也吃了，没有也过得去。公社党委为了统一思想认识，组织干部和群众展开了辩论。通过辩论，大家懂得了如果只单单抓几项主要生产而放松了副食品生产，就不能全面完成国家的商品收购计划，就会影响城市工矿区的物资供应；同时也会减少公社的现金收入，不能满足社员生活进一步提高的需要。
    在统一思想认识的基础上，公社党委加强了对副食品生产的领导，决定由党委书记挂帅，发动群众想办法把原有的酒厂、油坊、豆腐坊等作坊整顿恢复起来。为了解决劳力和原料的问题，公社党委和群众商量后，决定对各个战线上的劳动力进行统一调配，合理安排，除了个别老师傅、技术员以外，其余采取以女代男、以老代壮、以弱代强的办法，从全公社调整出13％的劳动力来专搞副业生产和副食品加工。在原料方面，除了充分运用公社生产的豆子、红薯、南瓜等物资以外，还采取了以野生代家生，以副品代正品，以杂粮代主粮的办法。两个月来，全社发动群众从山上找出土伏苓、金广子、黑树学、麻叶、桑叶等十几种野生植物一万多斤，制成了液糖、熬出了酒、榨出了油，并且收购了近千担芋子、南瓜、马铃薯、葱蒜等加工成各种各样的糖食糕点。公社粮食部门办的副食品加工厂，用红薯熬出了五十至八十度的白酒三千来斤，用红薯熬糖，掺灰面做出了一百多种饼干，并且加工成淀粉、粉条、粉皮，同时用红薯加70％的黄豆做成了豆腐，从10月下旬以来到目前为止，全公社共用六十七种代用品做出了五百多担干货，除了满足本地日常供应以外，还调了一批副食品供应外地工矿区和京广铁路复线工地。
    在大力开展副食品加工生产以后，剩下的豆渣、糖糟、酒糟、薯渣也就多了，这样就给家畜家禽增加了新的饲料，促进了生猪、鸡鸭的催肥工作。光是11月份，全社就调出了肥猪五百七十头，鸡鸭蛋三百五十担，鲜鱼一千零一十担，大大增加了社里的现金收入。
