Comprehensive Utilization of Waste into Treasure
—Introduction to the Forest Industry Pavilion at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
By Our Correspondent Shao Yongli

As soon as you step into the Forest Industry Pavilion, your attention is immediately drawn to a huge map of China's forest resources, which shows that thousands of tree species grow on China's vast land spanning the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, making it one of the countries with the most tree species in the world.

However, we have shortcomings in the utilization of this forest treasure. According to surveys, China's current timber utilization rate is only 60%. If calculated based on the forest stock volume, the utilization rate is only about 50%. Therefore, the important task facing the forestry processing sector is to ensure the full and comprehensive utilization of the country's forest resources. The entire collection of exhibits in the Forest Industry Pavilion focuses on reflecting the new achievements China has made in the comprehensive utilization of timber in recent years. One piece of data here informs visitors: If the utilization rate of the 35 million cubic meters of timber harvested this year is increased from the current 60% to 90%, the country can produce an additional 10 million cubic meters of good timber.

Making Great Use of Small Timber
In people's minds, there has always been the old idea that timber can only be used extravagantly and not economically. However, the workers of timber processing plants have created miracles of making great use of small timber and turning waste timber into good timber. In a corner of the Forest Industry Pavilion, beautiful new-style furniture is displayed, appearing to be made of the finest wood. There are no joints, knots, cracks, or wormholes commonly found on ordinary furniture. What you see are elegant patterns and generous designs. If it weren't for the explanation of the guide, no one would guess that these items are actually made of small pieces and wood edges cut off during wood processing to make fine woodworking panels. Sewing machine tabletops are also made using this type of fine woodworking panel. Even more appealing are the parquet flooring samples, which are rare in the international market. They are pieced together by the clever craftsmen of China's timber processing industry using the natural colors and patterns of small, oddly shaped pieces of wood left over from processing. If laid as flooring, they would be even more beautiful than patterns made of ceramic tiles.

Turning Waste into Good Timber
Even more interesting is another corner of the Forest Industry Pavilion, where a room decorated with particleboard made from wood chips and shavings is exhibited. The walls, floors, doors, windows, beds, cabinets, tables, chairs, high-end sewing machine tabletops, and radio casings are all made of particleboard. This type of particleboard has three major advantages: wide application, low price, and good quality. Moreover, it is about 10% cheaper than ordinary wood boards and can be used wherever wood boards are used. It is also unaffected by climate and can rival the best wood, so people praise it as "wood without defects."

Also on display here are exquisitely crafted fiberboards, some printed and some painted. The guide tells the audience that fiberboard has the advantages and properties of being lightweight, water-resistant, soundproof, heat-insulating, and electrically insulating. It is most suitable for decorating the interiors of rooms, vehicles, and ships, and for manufacturing furniture. It can also be used to replace ceramic tiles to decorate bathrooms and kitchens, with a total of over 300 uses. It is the most refined type of artificial board. However, it is made from tree branches, bark, and wood scraps discarded on forest farms.

Turning Thick Boards into Thin Boards, One Piece Serving as Three
To do a good job in the comprehensive utilization of timber, in addition to making great use of small timber and turning waste into good timber, it is even more important to improve the timber utilization rate. In the past, a thick log could only be sawn into a limited number of boards. If the logs are sawn into thin slices, and then glued together vertically and horizontally to become plywood, the timber utilization rate can be greatly improved. According to calculations, one cubic meter of logs can be sawn into a maximum of 58 square meters of boards. However, the same amount of logs can be made into 143 square meters of plywood, with the same usage value as ordinary boards. It also eliminates the defects of ordinary boards and can utilize the natural patterns of wood to create beautiful designs. Before liberation, even ordinary plywood had to be imported from foreign countries. The exhibition displays more than 20 types of domestically produced plywood, including ordinary plywood made from forest trees, as well as high-end plywood required for building aviation and shipbuilding tools. At present, China's plywood production can not only meet the needs of domestic construction, but also export a portion. When visiting the exhibition, visitors can see a high-end glider made of domestically produced plywood hanging from the ceiling of this pavilion, and below it are displayed motorboats and racing boats made of domestically produced plywood that meet international standards.

Sawdust is a Treasure, Able to Make Sugar and Wine
The Forest Industry Pavilion also exhibits white wine, alcohol, glucose, furfural, activated carbon, and other chemical products made from sawdust. The exhibition has a material explanation: For every cubic meter of timber processed, there is 7% sawdust. One ton of completely dry sawdust can produce 150 kilograms of 96-proof alcohol, which is equivalent to the amount of alcohol made from 300 kilograms of grain or 10 tons of potatoes, and can also produce a large number of by-products. In addition, the magnificent artificial marble made of sawdust by the workers of the Dalian Lumber Mill and the Beijing Brick and Tile Factory is also exhibited here. It is as strong and beautiful as real marble, and has the advantages of being lightweight, soundproof, and low in value. Using it to decorate tall buildings can reduce the load of the building.

Reviewing the exhibits in the Forest Industry Pavilion, one can draw the conclusion that there is no waste on a tree. Small and waste materials can be used to make a variety of furniture and artificial boards, and the leaves, fruits, and bark of trees can also be used to create various useful chemical products. For example, Zhejiang Province uses Masson pine, which used to be burned as firewood, to make beautiful rayon fabrics. According to calculations, one cubic meter of Masson pine can be made into rayon that can weave 4,500 meters of silk, which is equivalent to the silk fabric spun by 320,000 silkworms, but the price is only one-tenth of that of natural silk.

The high-grade rosin exhibited here has reached international standards in quality, and its output has jumped to third place in the world. The leaves that fall every year are mostly left to rot, but if utilized, they also have great value. The exhibition features more than 20 types of fragrant oils processed from various tree leaves. There are also nutritious needle-leaf feed made from needles and more than 20 types of tannin extracts made from various tree barks. These all show that forest by-products are also important raw materials for China's chemical industry.

    综合利用废品成宝
    ——全国工业交通展览会森林工业馆介绍
    本报记者  邵永力
    一踏进森林工业馆，瞩目便是巨幅的我国森林资源图型，它表明了在我国地跨寒、温、热三带的辽阔土地上，生长着几千种树木，成为世界上树种最多的国家之一。
    但是，对这样的森林宝库，我们在利用上是有缺点的。据调查，我国现在木材利用率只有60％，如以林木的蓄积量来计算，利用率只有50％左右。因此，摆在林业加工部门面前的重要任务，是使国家的森林资源得到充分的综合利用。森林工业馆整个的展品集中地反映了我国近几年来木材综合利用的新成就。这里有一项资料告诉观众：如果把今年采伐的三千五百万立方公尺木材的利用率，从现在的60％提高到90％，就可以给国家多生产出一千万立方公尺的好材。
    小材大用
    在人们思想上，一向有着木材只能大材小用，不能小材大用的旧观念。但是，木材加工厂的职工们，就创造了小材大用、废材变好材的奇迹。在森林工业馆的一角上，陈列着美丽的新式家具，好像都是用最上等的木料制造的，根本找不到一般家具上常有的接缝、结疤或裂纹和虫眼，看到的是秀丽的花纹和大方的图案。如果不听讲解员的说明，谁也猜不到这些东西，竟是用木材加工中截掉的小材和木边制造的细木工板做成的，利用这种细木工板制造的还有缝纫机的台面。比这更吸引人的是在国际市场上罕见的拼花地板的样品。它是我国木材加工业的巧匠们，利用加工中剩下的七棱八角的小木料的天然颜色和花纹拼出来的，如果铺成地板，比磁砖拼成的图案还要漂亮。
    废材变好材
    更有趣的在森林工业馆的另一角，展出了一间碎木刨花制成的人造板装饰起来的房间，室内的墙壁、地板、门、窗和床、柜、桌、椅子等，以及高级的缝纫机台板、收音机的外壳，都是用碎木刨花板制成的。这种碎木刨花板有三大优点：用途广泛、价格便宜、质量好。而且比一般木板价格低10％左右，在一切使用木板的地方都可以使用，并且不受气候影响，可以和最好的木材相媲美，所以人们称誉为“没有缺陷的木材”。
    这里展出的还有精制的纤维板，有的印花，有的喷漆。讲解员告诉观众：纤维板有着体轻、耐水、隔音、隔热、绝缘等优点和性能，最适用于装修室内、车、船的墙壁和制造家具，还可以用它代替磁砖饰浴池、厨房，共有三百多种用途，是各种人造板里最精致的一种。但它却是用林场上被抛弃的树枝、树皮、碎木等制造出来的。
    厚板变薄板，一块顶三块
    要搞好木材综合利用，除了小材大用，把废材变成好材外，更重要的是提高木材利用率。过去一根厚木只能锯成有限的几块木板，如果把原木锯成薄片，经过加工纵横胶合成为胶合板，就可以大大提高木材的利用率。据计算，一立方公尺的原木最多只能锯成五十八平方公尺的木板，然而用同样多的原木制成胶合板，却有一百四十三平方公尺，使用价值与普通木板完全一样，还消灭了一般木板上的缺点，并可利用木材的天然花纹拼出美丽的图案。在解放前，连普通的胶合板都要从外国进口。这次展览会上展出的我国自制的胶合板，就有二十多种，其中有用林木制成的普通胶合板，还有建造航空、船舶工具需要的高级胶合板。目前我国的胶合板生产，不仅能够满足国内建设的需要，而且可以出口一部分。观众们在参观展览会的时候，就可以看到这个馆的天棚上挂着一架用我国自制胶合板制造的高级滑翔机，下面陈列的还有用自制胶合板制成的质量达到国际标准的摩托艇、赛艇等。
    锯末是个宝，能造糖和酒
    在森林工业馆里展出的还有用锯末制造的白酒、酒精、葡萄糖、糠醛、活性炭等化学制品。展览馆有一项材料说明：每加工一立方公尺木材，就有7％的锯末，而一吨完全干燥的锯末，就可以造出九十六度的酒精一百五十公斤，这相当于三百公斤粮食或十吨薯类造的酒精量，同时还可以产出大量副产品。另外，这里展出的还有大连制材厂、北京砖瓦厂职工用锯末制成的十分壮丽的人造大理石，和真正的大理石一样坚固美观，还有体轻、隔音、价值低廉等优点，用它来修饰高楼大厦，可以减轻建筑物的负荷量。
    综览森林工业馆的展品，使人得出这样的结论：树身上没有废物。可以利用小材、废材制成多种多样的家具、人造板，还可以用树上的叶、果、皮等造出各种有用的化学制品。如展出的浙江省用过去当柴烧的马尾松，制成了漂亮的人造丝织品。据计算，一立方公尺马尾松制成的人造丝就可以织成四千五百公尺绸子，这等于三十二万只蚕吐的丝的丝织品，价格却只有天然丝的十分之一。
    这里展出的高级松香，质量已达到国际标准，产量已跃居世界第三位。每年一生一落的树叶，大多任其腐烂，如果加以利用，价值也很大。展览会上就有利用各种树叶加工的芳香油二十多种。还有利用针叶制出的含有营养丰富的针叶饲料和用各种树皮制成的二十几种栲胶。这些都说明林木副产品也是我国化学工业的重要原料。
