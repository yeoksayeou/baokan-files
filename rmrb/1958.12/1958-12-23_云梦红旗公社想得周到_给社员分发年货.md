    云梦红旗公社想得周到
    给社员分发年货
    本报讯  湖北省云梦县红旗人民公社根据生产、生活和思想一齐抓的精神，最近集中力量对社员的冬季生活进行了全面安排。现在，社员们生活过得好，生产劲头大。
    红旗人民公社这次全面安排生活是从整顿食堂入手的。在社员们吃饱吃好后，公社又紧接着给社员们分发了春节和过冬御寒的生活必需品。还给每个社员发给自由支配的八十到一百斤粮食，十斤到二十斤糯谷，五斤黄豆，二斤皮棉，八十斤柴火，花生、荸荠各两斤，另外还发给每家一些腊肉。公社又决定除了保证本月按期发工资，并计划1月份一次发两个月的工资。
    这个公社的冬季生活安排得好，社员们的劳动热情也普遍提高。现在全社95％左右的劳力都出了勤。  （许良骥）
