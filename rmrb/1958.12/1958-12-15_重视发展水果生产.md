    Attaching Importance to Developing Fruit Production
    Yu Ming
    The Shuguang First Cooperative in Woyang County, Anhui Province, has paid attention to planting fruit trees since liberation. As a result, the average fruit harvest per person has reached 300 jin. This is something that deserves attention.
    People's communes in various regions are actively developing diversified economies and expanding commodity production. Fruit tree planting should be an important aspect of this production. Judging from the situation of the Shuguang First Cooperative, producing more fruit can not only meet social needs but also greatly increase the commune's wealth.
    There is a saying in China, "Peaches take three years, apricots four, and pears five." This means that developing fruit production takes time. The Shuguang First Cooperative is a case in point. It took eight years of hard work to complete the fruit tree planting plan and achieve relatively large benefits. Therefore, the plan to plant fruit trees should be included in the current development plan for diversified economies.
    Some people believe that planting fruit trees is a distant solution to an immediate problem. When formulating development plans for diversified economies, they are reluctant to include fruit tree planting in the plan. Even if it is included, they may forget about fruit tree planting when other tasks are busy. As a result, in these places, fruit production was a "distant solution" in the past, it is a "distant solution" now, and it will be a "distant solution" in the future.
    Distance and nearness are a unity of opposites. There must be nearness where there is distance, and nearness comes from distance; distance can be transformed into nearness. When formulating development plans for diversified economies, we must consider both immediate interests and long-term interests. That is, we must develop cash crops that can immediately meet social needs and increase the wealth of the commune and the income of its members, and we must also pay attention to developing cash crops that cannot increase income temporarily but will be able to greatly meet social needs and increase the commune's income in the future. The Shuguang First Cooperative has set a good example for us. They paid attention to developing fruit production in the past. After several years of effort, they have now transformed the "distant solution" into a "near solution" and have begun to harvest a large amount of fruit. In the future, the fruit harvest will continue to increase.

    重视发展水果生产
    于明
    安徽涡阳县曙光一社，因为解放以后就注意种植果树，所以现在收获的水果，每人平均已达三百斤。这是一件很值得注意的事情。
    各地人民公社正在积极发展多种经济，扩大商品生产。种植果树，应该是其中很重要的一项生产。从曙光一社的情况来看，多产水果，既可以供应社会需要，也可以大大增加公社的财富。
    中国有句俗话，叫“桃三、杏四、梨五”。这就是说要发展水果生产，是需要经过一定的时间的。曙光一社就是如此，经过八年的奋斗，才完成了种植果树的计划和有了比较大的收益。因此，现在的发展多种经济的规划中就应当把种植果树的计划列入。
    有些人认为种植果树，远水不解近渴。他们在制定发展多种经济规划时，就不大愿意把种植果树列入规划；即使列入了规划，在其他工作繁忙时，也会把种植果树的事情忘掉的。结果，在这些地方，水果生产，过去是“远水”，现在是“远水”，将来也是“远水”。
    远和近是对立的统一，有远必有近，近就是从远来的，远可以变成近。在制定发展多种经济规划的时候，既要从目前利益出发，又要照顾长远利益，这就是既要发展能够立即满足社会需要和增加公社财富和社员收入的经济作物生产，又要注意发展暂时不能增加收入但将来可以大量满足社会需要和增加公社收入的经济作物生产。曙光一社已为我们做出了很好的榜样。他们在过去就注意发展水果生产，经过几年努力，现在把“远水”变成了“近水”，开始大量收获水果。今后，水果的收获还会越来越多。
