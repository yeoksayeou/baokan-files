Debate on Use of Funds Calculate Production Needs
Liaohe Commune Eliminates Waste and Plans Funds Usage

(Reported by this newspaper) The Liaohe People's Commune in Nanyang County, Henan Province, in rectifying the commune's financial work, opposed extravagance and waste, tightened non-productive expenditures, and conducted overall planning of funds, so that every penny could be used in the most urgently needed aspects of current industrial and agricultural production.

Many cadres of the Liaohe People's Commune believed that since the people's commune had been established, it was necessary to show off the commune's wealth. In order to demonstrate the "superiority" of the commune, they bought a lot of recreational supplies and utensils that were not urgently needed at the moment. According to statistics in August alone, the money that the entire commune should have turned over but had not turned over reached more than 5,000 yuan, most of which was used for non-productive expenditures. The Songmaying Production Team used more than 150 yuan of public funds for entertainment expenses, and the Wangchenzhuang Brigade used the income that should have been turned over to purchase more than 600 yuan of recreational equipment. Some teams, in order to easily use public funds at will, also concealed the public accumulation funds and property of the original advanced cooperatives when merging into the commune.

In order to reverse this chaotic situation and quickly bring financial affairs back on track, in September, the Communist Party Committee of the Liaohe People's Commune decided to launch a major debate throughout the commune on rectifying financial work and opposing extravagance and waste. The debate was first conducted among the commune's accounting staff and cadres above the level of team leader, mainly debating whether it was better to use funds for production or to waste them, and whether it was better to manage funds uniformly or to manage them in a decentralized manner. The erroneous behavior of some production teams in failing to turn over income, arbitrarily using public funds, and wasting funds was also criticized. Through the debate, many people realized the harm of wasting funds. After presenting the facts and calculating the production funds needed at the moment, these non-productive expenditures were reduced. The entire commune reduced more than 15,000 yuan of non-productive expenditures. This money was immediately used to purchase urgently needed means of production for industry and agriculture, such as sesame cakes, manure, mild steel, and pesticides.

In order to ensure that financial work was put on the right track, democratic management systems such as income turnover, financial expenditure, cash management, financial disclosure, and reimbursement were also formulated.

While rectifying financial work, vigorous efforts were made to develop diversified economic production, open up multiple sources of income, and increase financial revenue. (Fang Huang)

    辩论资金用途  计算生产需要
    潦河公社杜绝浪费统筹资金用途
    本报讯  河南省南阳县潦河人民公社在整顿公社财务工作中，反对铺张浪费，紧缩非生产性开支，进行资金统盘规划，使每一个钱都能用到当前工、农业生产最急需的方面。
    潦河人民公社不少干部认为成立人民公社了，要摆摆公社的阔气，为了显示公社的“优越性”，大买文娱用品和当前不急需的用具，仅据8月份统计，全公社应上交未上交的钱就达五千多元，大多数都用于非生产性开支，宋马营生产队将一百五十多元的公款作了招待费，王陈庄大队将应上交的收入购买了六百多元文娱用具，有些队为了便于随便动用公款，在并社的时候，还隐报原高级社的公积金和财产。
    为了扭转这种混乱的局面，迅速把财务纳入正轨，9月份中共潦河人民公社党委决定在全社开展一个整顿财务工作，反对铺张浪费的大辩论，首先在全社的会计人员和队长以上的干部中进行了辩论，主要是辩论了资金用于生产好，还是浪费好，资金统一管理好，还是分散管理好，并且批判了有些生产队收入不上交，随便动用公款和浪费资金的错误行为。通过辩论，很多人都认识到浪费资金的危害性。在摆事实和算当前需要的生产资金账后，这些非生产性的开支都被压缩下来，全社共压缩一万五千多元非生产性开支。用这笔钱即时购买了麻饼、大粪、软钢筋、农药等工、农业上急需用的生产资料。
    为了保证财务工作走上正规，还制订了收入上交、财政开支、现金管理、财政公开、报销等民主管理制度。
    在整顿财务工作同时，大力发展多种经济生产，多头多路开辟财源，增加财政收入。（方徨）
