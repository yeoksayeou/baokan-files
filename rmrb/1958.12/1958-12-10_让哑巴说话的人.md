The Person Who Makes the Mute Speak
By our correspondent Zhang Wei

In June 1956, after Yang Fuzhi, a doctor at the Huangtan District Health Center in Tianmen County, cured several deaf patients with acupuncture, he had the idea of treating mutes. Yang Fuzhi thought, "Most mutes are caused by deafness. Since we can restore hearing to the deaf, why can't we make the mute speak after restoring their hearing?"

"Cure mutes! Make mutes speak! Relieve the suffering of mutes!" This wish drilled into his mind. He was obsessed, thinking about it while walking, sitting, and eating. He searched everywhere for relevant reference books. However, medical books did not have specific records of treating mutes. Only when studying Pavlov's theory did he deduce that hearing and speech both belong to the brain's nervous system, and restoring hearing will naturally enable the mute to speak. This further affirmed his idea.

He went to see Wang Buqing, the secretary of the Huangtan District Party Committee, and told him his idea. Wang Buqing was very excited when he heard that he wanted to treat mutes, and said to him, "We haven't seen anyone who can treat mutes yet. Tell me about your reasoning!" After Yang Fuzhi explained his idea, the district party secretary pondered for a moment and enthusiastically said to him, "We will definitely support you."

Not long after, Xiao Zhichao, the district head, brought a mute to the health center to find Yang Fuzhi. The mute, Wu Changlin, was a member of the Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative (now Yuxin Commune), and was thirty-two years old that year. He became deaf and mute due to illness at the age of three. After eight treatments, Wu Changlin first regained his hearing and could hear the sound of airplanes; after twelve treatments, he began to make sounds; by the end of the treatment, he was able to shout "Long live Chairman Mao."

After Yang Fuzhi achieved initial success in treating deafness and muteness, the county party committee attached great importance to it. In October of that year (1956), he was transferred to the county people's hospital to help him continue his research. The hospital established an acupuncture department, set up beds for deaf-mute patients, and reduced or waived hospitalization and medical expenses for deaf-mute patients. The hospital's branch secretary and director often talked to him, encouraged him, and helped him solve the difficulties he encountered.

More and more people requested treatment for deafness and muteness, and even people from surrounding counties such as Jingshan, Zhongxiang, and Qianjiang came to seek treatment.

After Yang Fuzhi's treatment, the effects were generally good, but patients had difficulty speaking, and their pronunciation was not accurate. Where was the problem? He thought of the main acupoint "Ya Men" (the area below the back of the head): "Ya Men is closely related to the brain's nerves, but the books stipulate that 'Ya Men' can only be punctured shallowly; the curative effect is not high, is it related to the shallow puncture prescribed in the books?" He carefully studied the detailed structure of the human body in physiology and anatomy, and learned that the reason why the book stipulated that deep puncture was not allowed was because there were many blood vessels around this part, which could easily cause danger. Therefore, he initially concluded that the key lies in correctly mastering the operation of acupuncture. With this basis, he was wholeheartedly thinking about conducting experiments on deep puncture of "Ya Men." Because he couldn't easily experiment on patients, he had the idea of ​​experimenting on himself.

This idea caused a strong struggle in his mind. He looked at the acupuncture books in front of him. The books clearly stipulated that "Ya Men" is a forbidden acupoint, and can only be punctured three or four tenths of an inch deep, not deep puncture, and no moxibustion, otherwise it will cause fainting (shock or even death). He knew how dangerous it was to experiment on himself, but this did not make Yang Fuzhi retreat. The party's trust and support, and the deaf-mute patients' eager hopes, gave him greater encouragement. He thought of the story of the mute Zhang Yunxiang. ...

Zhang Yunxiang was from Jingshan County, a thirteen-year-old boy. His father was a township cadre. When he heard that Yang Fuzhi could cure mutes, he quickly sent his mute child to Tianmen County, more than a hundred miles away from his hometown, for treatment. After Zhang Yunxiang was hospitalized for a month, people in his hometown saw that he had not been cured for so long and said to Yunxiang's father: "How can a mute be cured?" Yunxiang's mother also chimed in: "Spending that much money for a month is better than earning work points at home. Go and bring Yunxiang back!" Yunxiang's father had no idea what to do after hearing everyone's argument, so he had to go to Tianmen County to pick up his child. As soon as he walked into the gate of the ward, he ran into his child walking towards him. He did not expect the child to open his mouth and call out "Dad." He was so surprised that tears almost came out of his eyes. The child had grown for more than ten years, and today was the first time he had heard him call "Dad"! He couldn't even speak for a moment.

The boundless trust of the masses, like a huge force, made Yang Fuzhi even more invigorated. He resolutely picked up the slender, soft, silver-white steel needle and experimented on himself with deep puncture of "Ya Men." He cautiously and accurately mastered the operation, and after puncturing to four tenths of an inch, he explored puncturing to six tenths, eight tenths, and all the way to one and a half inches deep. At this time, he felt that the effect of the needle was gradually expanding, not only did his neck feel swollen and numb on both sides, but even his tongue felt swollen and numb. He concluded that deep puncture can make the effect of the needle reach the throat and tongue, which is conducive to improving the curative effect of mutes. After he pulled out the needle, he moved his body and felt that he had not experienced any danger.

The next day, he boldly used deep puncture of "Ya Men" for the first time on Ma Yinzhen, a deaf-mute patient who was starting to learn to speak. After one deep puncture treatment, Ma Yinzhen's speech was obviously clearer than before. In order to further prove the curative effect of deep puncture, the hospital leaders immediately divided the deaf-mute patients into two groups, A and B, and performed deep puncture and shallow puncture respectively. After one course of treatment (fifteen acupuncture sessions as one course of treatment), the patients in Group A treated with deep puncture all spoke more clearly than the patients in Group B. Then, the hospital changed the original Group B to Group A to undergo deep puncture treatment, and re-selected five deaf-mute patients and assigned them to Group B to undergo shallow puncture. The effect was the same as before, proving that the curative effect of deep puncture was higher than that of shallow puncture.

In May and June of this year, Liang Zhongyang, a stroke patient, was transferred from the health center. Liang Zhongyang suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, suddenly fainted and became unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the right side of his body was paralyzed, his expression was dull, and he could not speak. After Yang Fuzhi treated him for fifteen days, all of Liang Zhongyang's conditions improved, but he still could not speak. At this time, Yang Fuzhi wanted to use his method of treating mutes to treat Liang Zhongyang, and also thought of using steel needle electrotherapy from Western medicine's electrotherapy. However, the books also stipulated that "Ya Men" cannot be moxibustion (electrotherapy belongs to a type of moxibustion). So he took himself as a steel needle electrotherapy experiment, and no danger occurred. After he treated Liang Zhongyang with acupuncture and electrotherapy once, the patient began to speak after only a few minutes. Through the treatment of this case, Yang Fuzhi also applied the steel needle electrotherapy method to treat deafness and muteness, further improved the curative effect of deafness and muteness, and gained more experience in treating deafness and muteness.

    让哑巴说话的人
    本报记者  张碨
    1956年6月间，天门县黄潭区卫生所医生杨辅之用针灸接连治好了几个耳聋病人之后，便产生了治哑巴的念头。杨辅之想：“哑巴多半是耳聋引起的，既然能使聋人恢复听力，为什么不能使哑巴在恢复听力以后说话？”
    “治哑巴！使哑巴讲话！解除哑巴的痛苦！”这个愿望钻进了他的脑海。他像着了迷似的，走着坐着吃着都在想这件事。他到处翻找有关的参考书。可是，医学书上没有专门治疗哑巴的记载。只是在钻研巴甫洛夫学说时才推论出：听力和言语同样都属于脑神经系统，耳聋恢复听力了，自然能使哑巴说话。这使他进一步肯定了自己的想法。
    他去找黄潭区区委书记汪步清，谈出了他的想法。汪步清听说他想治哑巴，感到非常兴奋，对他说：“现在还没有见过能治哑巴的，你讲讲你的根据吧！”杨辅之把自己的想法讲完以后，区委书记沉思了一下，热情地对他说：“我们一定支持你。”
    没过几天，区长萧志超带了个哑巴来卫生所找杨辅之了。哑巴吴长林是团结农业社（现在是渔薪公社）的社员，那年三十二岁。他在三岁时因病成为聋哑。经过八次治疗，吴长林首先恢复了听力，能听到飞机的声音了；十二次后，开始发音；结束治疗时他已能喊出毛主席万岁。
    杨辅之治疗聋哑得到了初步成功后，县委非常重视，在当年（1956年）10月间，便把他调到县人民医院来，帮助他继续钻研。院里建立了针灸科，设置了聋哑患者住院的床位，减免了聋哑患者的住院费、医疗费。医院的支部书记和院长，都经常来和他谈话，鼓励他，并帮他解决遇到的困难。
    要求治疗聋哑的人越来越多，连天门县周围的京山、钟祥、潜江等县都有人来求治。
    经过杨辅之的治疗，效果一般都比较好，但是病人说话很吃力，发音还不准确。问题在哪里呢？他从主要穴位“哑门”（后脑下边的地方）想起：“哑门跟大脑神经有密切的关系，但书上规定‘哑门’只能浅刺；疗效不高，是不是和书上规定的浅刺有关系呢？”他仔细研究了生理解剖学中关于人体的详细构造，知道了书上所以规定不许深刺，就是因为这个部位周围的血管多，容易发生危险。因此，他初步断定关键在于正确掌握针灸的操作。有了这个根据之后，他便一心一意想着要进行“哑门”深刺的试验。因为不能轻易试验病人，他就产生了用自身试验的念头。
    这个念头在他思想上引起了强烈的斗争。他望着摆在面前的针灸书，书上清楚地规定“哑门”是禁穴，只能刺三、四分深，不能深刺，不能灸疗，否则就会发生昏针（休克甚至死亡）现象。他知道，拿自己作试验有多大的危险性，但是这并没有使杨辅之退却，党对他的信任、支持，聋哑病人的热切希望，对他有更大的鼓舞。他想起了哑巴张云香的事情。……
    张云香是京山县人，一个十三岁的男孩，他的父亲是个乡干部，听说杨辅之能治哑巴，连忙把自己的哑巴孩子送到远离家乡一百多里地的天门县来治疗。张云香住院治疗一个月后，他家乡的人看见他这长时间还没治好回来，就对云香的父亲说：“哪有治好哑巴的？”云香的妈妈也跟着吵：“一个月花那些钱，还不如在家挣点工分。快去把云香接回来！”云香的爸爸听大家一吵，也没主意了，只好到天门县接孩子回家。他一走进住院处的大门，正碰到孩子迎面走来，没料到孩子开口就喊爸爸。他惊喜得眼泪都快流出来了，孩子长了十几年，今天还是第一次听见叫爸爸呀！他一时连话也说不出来。
  群众的无限信任，像一股巨大的力量，使杨辅之更加振奋起来。他坚决地拿起细软的银白色的钢针，拿自己作深刺“哑门”的试验。他谨慎、准确地掌握着操作，针刺到四分后，又探索着刺到六分、八分，一直使针刺到一寸五分深。这时，他感觉到针的作用在逐渐扩大，不仅脖子两边发胀发麻，连舌头也感到了胀麻。他断定深刺能使针的作用发挥到喉头、舌头上，利于提高哑巴的疗效。他把针拔出之后，动了动身子，觉得自己并没有发生丝毫的危险。
    第二天，他大胆地把深刺“哑门”第一次使用在开始学话的聋哑患者马银珍身上。马银珍经过一次深刺治疗后，讲话较前显然清楚了。为了进一步证明深刺的疗效，院领导立即把聋哑病人分成甲乙两组，分别施行深刺和浅刺。一个疗程之后（十五次针灸为一个疗程），用深刺治疗的甲组病人个个讲话都比乙组病人清楚。接着，院方把原来的乙组改为甲组施行深刺治疗，再另选五个聋哑病人编为乙组，施行浅刺，效果和前次一样，证明了深刺的疗效高于浅刺。
    今年5、6月间，从卫生所转来一个中风的病人梁中央。梁中央患脑溢血，突然昏倒，不省人事，苏醒后，身体右侧瘫痪，表情呆板，不能讲话。杨辅之对他实行十五天的治疗后，梁中央的一切病情都好转了，就是仍然不能讲话。这时，杨辅之就想用他治哑巴的办法来给梁中央治疗，同时从西医的电疗想到实行钢针导电治疗。但是，书上也规定了“哑门”不能灸疗（电疗属于灸疗的一种）。于是他又拿自身作为钢针导电的试验，没有发生任何危险。当他用针灸导电法给梁中央治疗一次后，只过几分钟，病人就开口讲话了。通过这个病例的治疗，杨辅之又将钢针导电的治疗方法用于治疗聋哑，进一步提高了聋哑的疗效，治疗聋哑的经验更丰富了。
