Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, December 2nd: Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, implemented material queueing and vehicle queueing, organized civilian transportation teams, and implemented division of labor and hierarchical transportation, increasing the prefecture's transportation capacity threefold, adapting to the rapidly increasing transportation demand.

Since September of this year, due to the "Marshal of Steel" taking office and the development of industrial and agricultural production, the prefecture's transportation volume has increased threefold, while the transportation capacity could only meet one-third of the demand, resulting in a backlog of materials. How to change this situation? Initially, the method of "squeezing upwards" was adopted, with each enterprise and commune requesting vehicles from the county, the county requesting vehicles from the prefecture, and the prefecture requesting vehicles from the province. As a result, the prefecture needed nearly a thousand vehicles, while the prefecture's transportation department had less than one hundred vehicles at the time. It was clearly impossible to obtain so many vehicles at once. Therefore, under the leadership of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee criticized this approach and proposed the mass line method of "dividing downwards," assigning transportation tasks of various materials to lower levels and mobilizing the entire population to engage in transportation, fully unleashing the potential of various transportation tools. After adopting this method, the tense transportation situation was changed, ensuring the supply of steel, coal, grain, and various civilian materials.

Their specific methods are: implementing material queueing and vehicle queueing. Materials are transported in batches according to urgency, first ensuring the transportation of steel materials, then ensuring the transportation of grain and coal, and finally ensuring the transportation of general materials. Vehicles are also assigned different transportation tasks according to distance. Trains are only allowed for distances of thirty kilometers or more, cars are used for distances of ten kilometers or more, and animal-drawn carts and handcarts are used for distances of less than ten kilometers, or they are transported by manpower. This eliminates the unreasonable phenomenon of short-distance loading and unloading by trains and short-distance round trips by cars, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient train cars and cars.

All cars of the prefecture's organs and enterprises are subject to unified dispatch, and some of the carts of the townships and communes are also transferred for unified use by the county. Cars and carts generally implement two-shift or three-shift transportation, with people resting but vehicles and horses not resting. Cars universally tow trailers. This eliminates and reduces vehicle idling, empty loads, and under-loads, improving vehicle utilization.

All cities and counties in the prefecture have also universally organized civilian transportation teams, organized into regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons, implementing unified leadership and division of labor for transportation. For example, Yanji County made the following division of labor for the county's transportation forces: the transportation teams of factories, mines, and enterprises mainly focus on self-transportation and secondarily on collaborative transportation; the transportation teams of streets and schools mainly focus on steel transportation and secondarily on general transportation; the transportation teams of townships and people's communes mainly focus on ensuring the transportation of their own townships and secondarily on supporting other places. Other cities and counties have also implemented similar methods. These transportation teams undertake most of the prefecture's material transportation tasks. For example, the transportation task of grain purchase in this winter is entirely undertaken by the transportation teams of townships and people's communes, while in previous years, the prefecture and county had to provide some transportation support.

### 延边合理排队运力增加两倍

    延边合理排队运力增加两倍
    新华社延吉2日电  吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州实行物资排队、车辆排队，组织民间运输队伍，分工分级运输，使全州运输力增加两倍，适应了运量猛增要求。
    今年9月以来，由于钢铁元帅升帐和工农业生产的发展，全州运输量猛增两倍，而运力只能满足运量的三分之一，不少物资积压运不出去。怎样改变这种状况？最初是采取“向上挤”的办法，各个企业和公社向县要车辆，县向州要车辆，州向省要车辆，结果全州共需要汽车近一千辆，而当时全州运输部门的全部汽车还不到一百辆。一下要这么多汽车显然是办不到的。于是，自治州党委在中共吉林省委领导下，批判了这种作法，提出了“往下分”的群众路线方法，把各种物资的运输任务逐级向下分，发动全民搞运输，使各种运输工具的潜力充分发挥出来。采取这种办法以后，改变了运输紧张的状况，保证了钢铁、煤炭、粮食和各种民用物资的供应。
    他们的具体作法是：实行物资排队和车辆排队。物资按轻重缓急，分批运输，首先保证钢铁物资的运输，其次保证粮食和煤炭的运输，再次保证一般物资的运输。车辆也按路程远近分担不同的运输任务，三十公里以上才准许用火车，十公里以上用汽车，十公里以下用兽力车和手推车或由人力搬运，这样就消除了火车短程装卸和汽车短程往返的不合理现象，克服了火车车皮和汽车不足的困难。
    全州机关企业的汽车都听候统一调用，各乡社的大车也调出一部分由县统一使用。汽车和大车还普遍实行了双班制或三班制运输，歇人不歇车马。汽车普遍拖带挂车。这样就消除和减少了车辆闲置、空载和少载现象，提高了车辆利用率。
    全州各市县还普遍组织了民间运输队，按团、营、连、排组织起来，实行统一领导，分工运输。例如，延吉县对全县的运输力量作了如下分工：各工厂、矿山、企业的运输队，以自货自运为主，以协作运输为副；各街道、学校的运输队，以钢铁运输为主，以一般运输为副；各乡、镇人民公社的运输队，以保证本乡、镇的运输为主，支援其它地方为副。其它各市县也实行了类似的办法。这些运输队担负了全州大部分物资运输任务。例如今冬征购粮的运输任务，就全部由乡、镇人民公社的运输队担当起来，而往年要由州、县支援一部分运输力量。
