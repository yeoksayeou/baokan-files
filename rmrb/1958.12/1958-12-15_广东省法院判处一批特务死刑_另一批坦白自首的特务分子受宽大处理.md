Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 14th: With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, the Guangdong judicial organs sentenced five Kuomintang-sent special agents—Yu Zuming, Kong Xianwei, Cao Hanhua, Zhao Jinjun, and Yang Xiangchun—to death on December 7th in Guangzhou, Zengcheng, Jiangmen, and other places for plotting explosions, arson, and the creation of riots, as well as distributing reactionary leaflets. They were executed immediately. Special agent Mao Weijun was given a suspended death sentence. In addition, special agents Huang Mengchen and Huang Songshou were sentenced to life imprisonment, and special agents Du Guoqing and Hu Runzhan were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment; special agent Chen Zeqing was sentenced to 17 years imprisonment. At the same time, in accordance with the policy of "leniency for confession, meritorious service for redemption," the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate announced that six special agents who confessed and surrendered—Chen Quan, Yang Laisheng, Huang Zengfu, Yang Jin, Yang Jinling, and Jia Guorong—would be exempt from prosecution and granted lenient treatment.

The special agent Yu Zuming, who was sentenced to death, joined the Kuomintang "Intelligence Bureau" special agent organization in Hong Kong in July of last year, and had been to Taiwan for special agent training in demolition and other areas. In December of last year, Yu Zuming sneaked into Guangzhou to survey the terrain, identifying the Aiqun Mansion and Cultural Park as targets for demolition. In August of this year, he was dispatched by the Kuomintang special agent organization to sneak into Guangzhou again, accepting two US-made timed bombs, two magnesium powder incendiary devices, and four detonators smuggled to him by the special agent organization, plotting to detonate them during the National Day parade, harming peaceful residents. Due to strict precautions, he did not dare to act. Later, he colluded with young apprentice Chen Jinbin to plot another bombing of the Aiqun Mansion and Cultural Park. With Chen Jinbin's denunciation and assistance, the public security organs arrested Yu Zuming before his conspiracy could be realized. In the face of conclusive evidence, Yu Zuming had no choice but to confess his crimes.

The special agent Kong Xianwei, who was sentenced to death, joined the Kuomintang "Central Committee Group One" special agent organization in Hong Kong in August of this year, accepted a demolition mission, and sneaked into Guangzhou, attempting to detonate explosives when the opportunity arose. The masses reported his suspicious activities to the public security organs, and after careful investigation, the public security organs confirmed his crimes and arrested him according to law.

The special agent Cao Hanhua, who was sentenced to death, joined a special agent organization in April of last year and received special agent technical training in collecting intelligence and using timed bombs and incendiary bombs. Later, he sneaked into Zengcheng, plotting to blow up railways, bridges, and warehouses, develop a special agent organization, collect intelligence, and attempt to assassinate state personnel. The special agent Zhao Jinjun joined a special agent organization in Hong Kong in July of last year, received special agent training, and sneaked into Jiangmen in May of this year, attempting to blow up the Jiangmen Paper Mill and the Beijie Sugar Mill. The special agent Yang Xiangchun joined the Kuomintang special agent organization in Hong Kong in May of this year, was appointed as the leader of an action team, and sneaked into Guangzhou to observe the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station, the People's Theater, and the Central Park, attempting to detonate explosives. These three special agents were all arrested by the public security organs according to law before their conspiracies could be realized.

The special agents Mao Weijun, Huang Mengchen, Du Guoqing, Chen Zeqing, Hu Runzhan, and Huang Songshou all joined the Kuomintang "Central Committee Group Two" special agent organization in Hong Kong. After sneaking into Guangzhou, Mao Weijun plotted to develop a special agent organization in schools and create disturbances. He also collected information on schools, rural areas, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, reporting it to the special agent organization. The special agent Huang Mengchen joined the special agent organization in July of this year and sneaked into Guangzhou, attempting to infiltrate factories and develop a special agent organization. The special agents Du Guoqing, Chen Zeqing, Hu Runzhan, and Huang Songshou all sneaked into the mainland after joining the special agent organization, attempting to gather intelligence and carry out various sabotage activities. They were arrested by our public security organs before their conspiracies could be realized.

The special agents who surrendered themselves, Chen Quan, Yang Jin, Yang Laisheng, Yang Jinling, Huang Zengfu, and Jia Guorong, were all special agents of the Kuomintang "Central Committee Group Two" special agent organization. They had all engaged in criminal activities after joining the special agent organization, but later, awed by the power of the people, they finally confessed and surrendered to the public security organs, and therefore received lenient treatment. For example, the special agent Chen Quan was a boatman traveling between Dongguan, Taiping, and Hong Kong. He joined the special agent organization in December of last year, and in May and June of this year, he successively accepted a piece of white explosive and two incendiary devices from the special agent organization in Hong Kong and carried them back to Taiping Town, Dongguan, attempting to blow up the second warehouse of the Taiping Wharf Native Produce Company. However, due to the high vigilance of the people, Chen Quan had no opportunity to carry out his sabotage and finally confessed to the public security organs his participation in the special agent organization and his crimes. The special agent Yang Jin joined the Kuomintang "Central Committee Group Two" special agent organization in Hong Kong in July 1954. After receiving special agent technical training in secret writing and other areas, he received five packets of secret writing medicine, one packet of developing medicine, a towel soaked with developing medicine, and special agent activity funds. He sneaked back into Guangzhou to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and successively reported our general election and military situation to the special agent organization five times in secret writing, and developed one person to join the special agent organization. Last year, he sneaked into Hong Kong again to report to the special agent organization on our anti-Rightist struggle. Later, awed by the power of the people, he finally surrendered himself to the public security organs and handed over the secret writing medicine.

    广东省法院判处一批特务死刑
    另一批坦白自首的特务分子受宽大处理
    新华社广州14日电  广东省司法机关经最高人民法院批准，7日分别在广州、增城、江门等地将阴谋进行爆炸、纵火和制造暴乱、散发反动传单的国民党派遣特务余祖铭、孔宪伟、曹汉华、赵锦俊、杨香春共五人判处死刑，立即执行；特务分子毛为均死刑缓期执行。另外判处特务分子黄梦尘、黄松寿无期徒刑，判处特务分子杜国庆、胡润湛二十年徒刑；判处特务分子陈泽卿十七年徒刑。与此同时，广东省人民检察院根据“坦白从宽，立功折罪”的政策，对坦白自首的特务分子陈权、杨来胜、黄增福、杨锦、杨金龄、贾国荣共六人宣布以免予起诉的宽大处理。
    被判处死刑的特务分子余祖铭，去年7月在香港参加国民党“情报局”特务组织，并曾经到台湾受爆破等特务训练。去年12月余祖铭曾潜入广州勘察地形，确定以爱群大厦、文化公园为爆破目标。今年8月他受国民党特务机关的派遣再度潜入广州，接受了特务机关偷运给他的美制定时炸弹两枚，镁粉纵火器两个，雷管四支，阴谋在国庆节向群众游行队伍进行爆破，残害和平居民。由于防范严密，他才没有敢动手。后来他又拉拢青年徒工陈锦彬再次阴谋爆破爱群大厦和文化公园。公安机关在陈锦彬的检举和协助下，在余祖铭的阴谋没有实现时就将他逮捕。余祖铭在确凿的罪证面前，不得不供认了他的罪行。
    被判处死刑的特务分子孔宪伟今年8月在香港参加了国民党“中委会一组”特务组织，并且接受爆破任务潜入广州，企图待机进行爆炸。群众向公安机关检举了他的可疑行动，公安机关经过缜密的侦察，证实了他的罪行，便依法将他逮捕。
    被判处死刑的特务分子曹汉华去年4月参加特务组织后，接受了收集情报使用定时炸弹、燃烧弹的特务技术训练。后来他潜入增城，阴谋爆破铁路、桥梁和仓库，并且发展特务组织和搜集情报，还企图暗杀国家工作人员。特务分子赵锦俊去年7月在香港参加特务组织后受过特务训练，今年5月他潜入江门，企图爆破江门纸厂和北街糖厂。特务分子杨香春今年5月在香港参加国民党特务组织后，被委派为行动组长，潜来广州市观察广九车站、人民戏院和中央公园，企图进行爆破。这三个特务分子都是在阴谋还没有实现的时候就被公安机关依法逮捕。
    特务分子毛为均、黄梦尘、杜国庆、陈泽卿、胡润湛和黄松寿都是在香港参加国民党“中委会二组”的特务组织。毛为均潜入广州后阴谋在学校中发展特务组织、制造骚乱事件。他还收集了学校、农村情况和镇压反革命的情况，向特务机关汇报。特务分子黄梦尘今年7月参加特务组织后，潜入广州企图混入工厂内部，发展特务组织。特务分子杜国庆、陈泽卿、胡润湛、黄松寿，都是在参加特务组织后潜入内地、企图刺探情报和进行各种破坏活动，在阴谋没有实现的时候就被我公安机关逮捕。
    投案自首的特务分子陈权、杨锦、杨来胜、杨金龄、黄增福、贾国荣，都是国民党“中委会二组”特务组织的特务分子。他们在参加特务组织后都有过罪恶活动，后来慑于人民群众的威力，终于向公安机关坦白自首，因而受到了宽大处理。例如特务分子陈权是来往东莞、太平到香港线的船工，去年12月参加特务组织，今年5、6月间先后在香港接受特务机关交给的白色炸药一块、纵火器二个携回东莞太平镇，企图爆破太平码头土产公司第二仓库，但是因为人民群众的高度警惕，陈权没有机会进行破坏，终于向公安机关坦白了他参加特务组织的经过和罪行。特务分子杨锦1954年7月在香港参加国民党“中委会二组”特务组织，受过密写等特务技术训练后，领取了密写药五包、显影药一包、浸有显影药剂的毛巾一条和特务活动经费，潜回广州进行反革命活动，曾先后五次将我普选和军事情况等密报特务机关，并发展了一人参加特务组织。去年，他又潜往香港，向特务机关汇报我反右派斗争的情况。后来，他慑于人民群众的威力，终于向公安机关自首，并交出了密写药剂。
