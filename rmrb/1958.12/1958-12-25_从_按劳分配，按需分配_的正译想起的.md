    Thoughts Inspired by the Correct Translation of "From Each According to His Ability, to Each According to His Needs"
    Lin Ling
    The correction of the translations of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" and "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work" in the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is of great significance. It raises the issue for our theoretical workers and translators that the translation of nouns and sentences involving political principles must be seriously and conscientiously studied. Mistakes must be corrected immediately to avoid ambiguity and confusion in understanding and thought due to incorrect translations.
      The translations of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" and "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work" have now been changed to "From each according to his ability, distributed according to his needs" and "From each according to his ability, distributed according to his work," which correctly expresses the original meaning. The meaning of "From each according to his ability, distributed according to his needs" was originally proposed by utopian socialists. Since Marx and Engels refined it into a clear and concise slogan more than a hundred years ago, the inaccurate Chinese translation has been circulating for more than fifty years, and it has only now been corrected.
    There are other similar inappropriate translations as well. For example, the term "continuous revolution" was originally widely disseminated by Marx and Engels, who expounded on the slogan first proposed by Blanqui's students. Because Trotsky misused this term, it was criticized by Stalin. Translators, in order to translate the Russian word "continuous revolution" used by Stalin differently from the Latin word "continuous revolution" used by Trotsky, created terms such as "uninterrupted revolution" and "non-stop revolution," leading readers to believe that they have different meanings. In fact, it is the same term. The problem can be clarified simply by adding quotation marks to some and not adding quotation marks to others, without creating several different terms to confuse readers.
    Another example is "cult of personality." The original meaning is "to worship an individual as an idol." Translating it as "individual superstition" or "individual worship" is closer to the original meaning. The term "崇拜 (chongbai - worship)" in Chinese does not have any religious connotations and is similar in meaning to "敬仰 (jingyang - respect and admire)." Therefore, translating "individual superstition" as "cult of personality" creates the impression that legitimate respect for those who are noble and respectable should also be negated. This is also an unfavorable consequence caused by insufficient consideration during translation.
    Some translated names contain significant theoretical issues, and the consequences are even more serious when concepts are blurred due to translation errors. For example, the term "essential differences" in "eliminating the essential differences between physical and mental labor, between workers and peasants, and between urban and rural areas" has always been translated well in the past, or with a few more words, translated as "differences in essence." However, some books later changed the translation to "major differences," which created a problem. In Russian, the word "essential" does indeed have the meaning of "major," and in some cases, it can be translated as "major" or "serious," but in this context, it cannot be translated as "major differences." Because what needs to be eliminated in communist society is precisely the essential differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between physical and mental labor, not "major differences" that are different in degree. What needs to be eliminated is the difference in "quality," not the difference in "quantity."
    The task of translation is to correctly convey the thoughts expressed in one language by using another language. The key is correctness. Incorrect translations not only fail to complete the task but also cause misunderstandings and create ideological confusion, which is very harmful.

### 从“按劳分配，按需分配”的正译想起的

    从“按劳分配，按需分配”的正译想起的
    林陵
    这次八届六中全会的文件里改正了“各尽所能、各取所需”和“各尽所能、各取所值”的译法，是有重要意义的。它向我们理论工作者和翻译工作者提出，对于牵涉政治原则问题的名词和句子的译法，必须严肃认真地研究，有错即改，以免由于错译而造成认识上、思想上的模糊和混乱。
      “各尽所能，各取所需”和“各尽所能，各取所值”的译法，现在改为“各尽所能、按需分配”、“各尽所能、按劳分配”，就把原来的意思正确地表达出来了。“各尽所能，按需分配”的意思，原来是空想社会主义者提出来的，自从马克思和恩格斯把它提炼成含义明确、用字简洁的口号以来，已经一百多年，不确切的中文译语流传了五十多年，直到现在才得到了改正。
    类似这种不适当的译法也还有。例如：“不断革命”一词本来是马克思和恩格斯引用布朗基的学生们最先提出的口号加以阐述而获得广泛传播的，因为托洛茨基错误地利用这一名词，被斯大林批驳过，翻译的人为了把斯大林所用的俄文字“不断革命”译得有别于托洛茨基所用的拉丁字的“不断革命”，便创造出“不间断的革命”和“不停顿的革命”等词，使读者看了，以为它们有不同的含义。其实这是一个词。只要有的加引号，有的不加引号，就可以把问题说清楚，而不必搞出几个不同的名词来，使读者糊涂。
    又如“个人崇拜”，原来的意思是“把个人当偶像敬拜”，译为“个人迷信”或“个人膜拜”，就比较切近原意。汉语中的“崇拜”一词并没有什么宗教的色彩，意思同“敬仰”差不多，因而把“个人迷信”译成“个人崇拜”，就造成一种印象，似乎对于那些崇高可敬的人的正当的敬仰也应当加以否定。这也是翻译时考虑不周而造成的不良后果。
    有些译名包含重大的理论问题，由于翻译的错误，使概念模糊，其后果就更加严重了。例如“消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的、工人与农民之间的、城市与乡村之间的本质差别”里的“本质差别”一词过去一向是翻译得不错的，或者加几个字，译为“在本质上的差别”，但后来有些书上改译为“重大差别”就发生了问题。在俄文里，“本质的”一词确实也有“重大的”的意思，在某些场合可以译为“重大的”或“严重的”，但是在这一场合，就无论如何不能译为“重大差别”。因为进入共产主义社会，要消灭的正是工农之间、城乡之间、体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的本质上的差别，而不是程度上有所高下的“重大差别”。要消灭的正是“质”的差别，而不是“量”的差别。
    翻译的任务在于把一种语言所表达的思想，改用另一种语言正确地传达出来。关键就在于正确。不正确的翻译非但不能完成任务，并且还会发生误会，造成思想混乱，那就为害不浅了。
