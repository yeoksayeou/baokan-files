Leshan Giant Buddha
Lìn Chángbīn

The great Lingyun Buddha of Leshan, a legend for thousands of years: one can sleep on the back of its hand, set up a banquet table on its head, when the river floods over its feet, Leshan will be submerged! With the great leap forward in agriculture, what does the Great Buddha matter? Cut a jade corn stalk, and give it to him as a walking stick; pick a sunflower, and use it as an umbrella for him; grow a big pumpkin, and use it as a foot basin for him.

Note: The Lingyun Temple in Leshan, Sichuan, has a large Buddha statue. According to the "Leshan County Chronicle": 'In the early years of the Tang Dynasty's Kaiyuan period, the monk Haitong carved a Maitreya statue out of the cliff at the turbulent confluence of the Min River, Mo River, and Qingyi River. It is 360 feet high, with a circumference of 10 zhang at the top, and eyes 2 zhang wide.' The size of the Great Buddha is imaginable.

    乐山大佛
    赁常彬凌云一大佛，千古人传说：手背能睡觉，头顶摆席桌，江水淹过脚，乐山遭漂没！农业大跃进，大佛何足论？砍根玉麦秆，给他杵棍棍；摘颗向日葵，给他当伞撑；结个大南瓜，给他做脚盆。
    注：四川乐山凌云寺有大佛像，据“乐山县志”记载：‘唐开元初寺僧海通于岷江、沫水、青衣水汇流湍悍处，岩石壁立，凿为弥勒大像，高三百六十尺，顶围十丈，目广二丈。’大佛之大，可以想见。
