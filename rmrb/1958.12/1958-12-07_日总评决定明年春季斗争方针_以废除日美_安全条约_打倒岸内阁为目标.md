Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 5th: The All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions (Sohyo) decided at a meeting of its executive council held today that Sohyo will aim to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet in its spring struggle next year.

The basic policy for next year's spring struggle decided by Sohyo at this meeting also stipulates that, in view of the fact that the Nobusuke Kishi government and capitalists will intensify their policies of oppressing the working class in the future, Japanese workers will also put forward economic demands such as increasing wages and establishing a uniform national minimum wage system in the spring struggle to be launched next year. The basic policy also stipulates that Sohyo should complete preparations for launching the spring struggle around January 20th next year, and during the period from late February to early March, launch simultaneous struggles by various trade unions to push the spring struggle to a climax.

    日总评决定明年春季斗争方针
    以废除日美“安全条约”打倒岸内阁为目标
    新华社5日讯  东京消息：日本工会总评议会在今天举行的干事会会议上决定，“总评”在明年展开春季斗争时，将以废除日美“安全条约”、打倒岸信介内阁等为目标。
    “总评”在这次会议上决定的明年春季斗争的基本方针还规定，鉴于岸信介政府和资本家今后将加紧执行压迫工人阶级的政策，日本工人在明年展开的春季斗争中还要提出增加薪金和建立全国一律的最低工资制等经济要求。这项基本方针还规定，“总评”要在明年1月20日前后就做好展开春季斗争的准备工作，并且在从2月下旬到3月上旬这一期间，发动各工会同时展开实力斗争，把春季斗争推向高潮。
