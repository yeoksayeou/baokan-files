Xia Yan Discusses Methods of Writing Film Scripts

It is necessary to mobilize broad creative forces to engage in film script writing, but a film script is not as simple as a folk song. Recently, the magazine "China Film" has continuously published playwright Xia Yan's essay "Several Issues in Writing Film Scripts," which will definitely be of great help to comrades in literary and art circles and those outside of them who are preparing to try writing film scripts.

The author tells readers many useful pieces of knowledge in this regard in a popular and friendly manner, including the author's own creative experience and unique artistic insights, with abundant and specific examples. The article discusses creative techniques, but it emphasizes the purpose of the techniques everywhere, requiring the expression of a clear pulse of the times, and requiring that the techniques be closely linked to the theme and ideology, art, and politics. Secondly, the author emphasizes that because film has a broad mass character, film authors must take into account the artistic appreciation habits of the broad masses of the Chinese people, that is, first of all, to make the audience fully understand the content of the film, so it is not appropriate to adopt too Westernized methods. The author raises this point to the mass viewpoint of artistic workers. His view of comparing the director to a "tour guide" of story scenes is also very insightful.

At present, the article is not yet finished, but from the chapters that have been published on the beginning, structure, and context of the film, it seems that what the author is talking about is the creation method of film scripts, but it also involves the creation method of general literature and art. This is a good essay. People who are not preparing to write film scripts can also read it and use it to deepen their understanding of film. The article quotes the wonderful creative theories of ancient dramatists such as Li Liweng and Qiao Mengji, making them serve the present and also increasing the readers' knowledge of valuable national art theory, adding Chinese color to the essay.

    夏衍谈写电影剧本的方法
    需要发动广泛的创作力量来从事电影剧本的写作，但是一个电影剧本它究竟不像一首民歌那样简单。最近“中国电影”杂志连续发表了剧作家夏衍同志的“写电影剧本的几个问题”的论文，对于准备试写电影剧本的文艺界和文艺界以外的同志们肯定是有很大帮助的。
    作者通俗地亲切地告诉读者许多关于这方面的有益的知识，其中包括作者自己的创作经验，自己的独到的艺术见解，有丰富的具体的例子。文章是谈创作技法，但是处处强调技法的目的性，要求表现鲜明的时代脉搏，要求技法与主题思想，艺术与政治紧密地联系起来。其次，作者着重指出，由于电影具有广泛的群众性，电影作者必须照顾中国广大群众的艺术欣赏习惯，就是首先要使观众充分地了解影片内容，因此不宜采用太洋派的手法。作者把这一点提高到艺术工作者的群众观点来谈。他把编导比做故事场景的“导游者”的见解也是很精辟的。
    目前，文章还未结束，就已发表的关于影片的开端、结构、脉络等章节看来，作者所谈的虽则是电影剧本的创作方法，但也涉及一般文艺的创作方法。这是一篇好论文。不准备写电影剧本的人也可以看，可以借此加深对电影的理解。文章引用了李笠翁、乔梦吉等古代戏剧家的精彩的创作理论，使之古为今用，也使读者增加了宝贵的民族艺术理论的知识，使论文增添了中国色彩。  （春）
