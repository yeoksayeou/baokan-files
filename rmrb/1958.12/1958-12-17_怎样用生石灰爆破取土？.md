    The principle of using quicklime blasting to extract soil is exactly the same as using explosives blasting to extract soil. The difference is that explosives blasting ignites the explosives through a fuse, causing rapid oxidation of the explosives and producing an explosion to loosen the soil; quicklime blasting to extract soil involves pouring water into hollow moso bamboo. During the process of quicklime being converted into slaked lime by water, releasing a large amount of heat, a large expansion force is generated, loosening and disintegrating the soil. The specific method is as follows: Choose a terrain with more free faces, and dig a blast hole in the center. The shape of the blast hole is small at the top and large at the bottom, like a gourd shape. Stand a hollow moso bamboo in the center of the blast hole, with many small water outlet holes drilled in the lower section of the bamboo (if a lot of lime is loaded, several moso bamboos can be arranged in a row) to distribute the water evenly. Then fill it firmly with freshly kiln-fired quicklime (no more than one day old), and fill the blast hole tightly with soil (the degree of compactness should exceed the original soil, otherwise it will release a "sky cannon"). When pouring water, insert a funnel into the moso bamboo and pour the water in at once (the water pouring cannot be stopped halfway, once stopped, the small holes will be blocked by lime and can no longer be poured in). After pouring, plug the moso bamboo tightly with a stopper. After two hours, the soil will loosen and collapse.

    怎样用生石灰爆破取土？
    生石灰爆破取土和利用火药爆破取土的道理完全一样，所不同的，火药爆破是通过引火线点火，引起火药的急速氧化，产生爆炸使土松动；生石灰爆破取土是从空心楠竹把水灌入。在生石灰受水转化为熟石灰放出大量热的过程中，产生一种很大的膨胀力，使土松动瓦解。其具体作法：选择一个自由面较多的地形，在其中心处打个炮眼，炮眼的形状上小下大，如葫芦形。在炮眼的中央竖立一根空心楠竹，楠竹的下段钻许多出水小孔（如果装灰多，可竖排几根楠竹），使水分均匀分布。然后装实刚出窑不久的生石灰（不要超过一天以上），用土把炮孔填紧（紧密程度要超过原土，否则就会放冲天炮）。灌水的时候，用漏斗插入楠竹，一次把水灌下（灌水不能中途停止，一停小孔就为石灰阻塞，再也灌不进去），灌好后用塞子把楠竹塞紧，过两小时，土就松动、崩塌。
