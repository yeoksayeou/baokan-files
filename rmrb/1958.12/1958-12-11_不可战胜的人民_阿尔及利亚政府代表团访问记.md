The Invincible People
—Notes on a Visit by the Algerian Government Delegation

"Today, the Algerian National Liberation Army has almost completely controlled the entire Algeria. The French colonial troops there are in a state of insecurity at any time." Minister Mahmoud Cherif, his face glowing, excitedly told us that he could use these two sentences to summarize the victorious situation of the Algerian national liberation movement.

This envoy of the heroic people opened a recently published issue of "El Moudjahid" - the organ of the Algerian National Liberation Front, pointed to four Algerian military maps on it that marked the National Liberation Army's four-year battle achievements, and continued to tell us in a tone full of victorious confidence:

"In Algeria, neither the French invading troops nor the French colonists dare to act alone anywhere. Even for a small transfer, or even just going a few kilometers away to fetch water, the enemy must mobilize tanks or aircraft for cover."

"The base areas of the Algerian National Liberation Army are constantly expanding and consolidating, and the guerrilla areas around them are also constantly extending. Many major areas are completely under our control," Minister Cherif said excitedly, pointing to the victory marks on the map, "Although the enemy is stronger than us in terms of manpower and equipment, they dare not easily offend the base areas of the National Liberation Army."

"The French colonial troops still occupy our major cities and some military strongholds, but their occupation has to pay a great price. The colonialists have stationed a large number of troops there and built many fortresses, military works, and power grids… Even so, the enemy is not safe in the areas they occupy, and there are heroic armed uprisings by Algerians in the cities every day."

Minister Cherif's voice, on behalf of the people standing at the forefront of the anti-colonial struggle, vividly constituted a picture of the Algerian national liberation movement advancing victoriously. The Algerian people, with more than a hundred years of glorious struggle tradition, have achieved brilliant victories in the recent four years of fighting, and the National Liberation Army has grown from thousands of people to more than one hundred thousand. Looking at the victory signs of those base areas and guerrilla areas constantly expanding on the map of Algeria, seeing those glorious lands returning to the hands of the Algerian people, we couldn't help but feel incomparable respect for our heroic comrades-in-arms in the common struggle against imperialism.

"The fighting Algerian people are all heroes, and many touching and tearful struggle deeds emerge every day in our land." When we hoped that the Algerian guests could introduce some stories of the people's heroic struggles, Minister Youssef Ben Khedda said proudly, with pride in his people. Then, the guests told us many moving examples, many nameless heroes. All of these made us more convinced that the people who hold high the banner of national liberation are forever invincible.

In order to cut off the connection between the Algerian National Liberation Army and the outside world and cut off their supplies, the French colonists built a blockade line hundreds of kilometers long on the border between Algeria and Morocco and Tunisia. Three power grids were laid on this blockade line, and the width between each power grid was three to six meters, with landmines buried everywhere in the middle. A large number of French troops stationed here built many reinforced concrete bunkers along the line. However, this blockade line, which the French colonists called the "copper wall and iron wall," did not block the heroic Algerian people. Every late night, there were many heroic fighters of the National Liberation Army, who, for the sake of the people and the honor of the motherland, did not hesitate to sacrifice their precious lives and rushed to volunteer to open many gaps in this blockade line, bringing in various supplies needed by the National Liberation Army.

The following is a combat story that newly occurred before the guests from Algeria left to visit our country. A team of National Liberation Army soldiers went through a whole night of forced march and encountered a French invading force the next morning that was much larger and better equipped than them. The fully armed enemy rode in seven cars and also brought a 75 mm cannon. After the soldiers discovered the enemy, regardless of the fatigue of the long march, they immediately gave the enemy a surprise attack. Although the soldiers of the National Liberation Army also suffered heavy casualties, they finally destroyed all the cars, killed all the enemies, and seized a large number of guns, radios, and that cannon. On that night, after quickly ending the battle, the soldiers used the newly seized cannon to destroy an enemy fortress. When the guests ended their visit, they gave us many photos of the actual record of the National Liberation Army's combat life, one of which was taken when the soldiers were using that cannon to bombard the enemy.

"What we have said is far from expressing one ten-thousandth of the Algerian people's heroic struggle spirit. However, from this you can also see how our people are willing to pay any price for the independence and freedom of the motherland." Minister Youssef Ben Khedda said excitedly: "What we are facing is an enemy with a modern armed force of 600,000 people, and they also have the military and financial support of the Atlantic Group countries, especially the United States. The French colonists brutally bombed towns and villages on our territory, shot old people, women, and even children, and burned down houses, forests, and all crops. Once a French colonist's body is found in a village, they burn down the entire village... but all of this has failed to conquer the heroic people, has failed to conquer their hearts for freedom and independence!"

The two ministers told us that there were two touching combat stories circulating in Algeria. One forty-man unit had been fighting a French colonial force of thousands of people for five days and nights. The fierce battle continued until the sixth day, and the soldiers' rations were all eaten up. At this moment, the heroes launched an offensive for the motherland, sparing no sacrifice, and they finally seized food and horses from the enemy and continued to fight... Another battle took place in the early days when the Algerian people began to carry out organized armed uprisings in 1954. The struggle at that time was a hundred times more difficult than it is now. Fourteen immortal people's heroes fought against an enemy division in a mountainous area. The soldiers insisted on fighting until the tenth hour, and thirteen of the fourteen people had been killed. The last hero destroyed the weapons in his hand himself, perished together with the enemy on the unconquerable land of the motherland, and shed the last drop of blood for freedom and independence.

We listened quietly to the guests here, and we couldn't restrain the excitement in our hearts. We couldn't help but pour out our feelings to the two ministers: "Such people are forever invincible! These touching and tearful heroic achievements cannot help but remind us of the history of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism for more than a hundred years. How similar are the heroic figures that have emerged from the common struggle of our two peoples!"

"The Algerian National Liberation Army relies on the people, loves the people, and the people also love the army and help the army. This is the source of our strength and the guarantee of victory!" Minister Youssef Ben Khedda expressed the harmonious military-civilian relationship like fish and water in Algeria in simple words and told us more profoundly the key to the victory and advancement of the Algerian national liberation movement.

"Our National Liberation Army and the people are one. In our country, there is not a family, no children who do not participate in the Liberation Army. The children of many mothers have been sacrificed, and many people have been locked in prison. It is obvious that our army could not exist under the strong colonial armed forces without the support of the people." Minister Cherif also used a few short sentences to introduce to us the characteristics and importance of this military-civilian relationship.

Listen to some examples of the Algerian people supporting the National Liberation Army told in plain language by the envoys from the heroic country!

"The people of our country automatically provide the army with food, clothing, medicine, and even livestock for transportation. Even our wounded soldiers are treated in the homes of ordinary people."

"Because the masses of the people provided timely information about the enemy's activities, our army was able to accurately strike the enemy or transfer in time to avoid enemy attacks and avoid undue losses."

"Whenever a commander of the National Liberation Army wants to destroy a certain area for combat needs so that the enemy cannot gain a foothold on his land, he tells the masses through the political commissar, and the masses act immediately within the specified time."

"In Algeria, everyone is a fearless fighter who strikes at the French colonial army. The French colonial army is under attack everywhere and is always uneasy. Whether in the city or in the countryside, you can see French colonial soldiers being killed by the people every day."

The Algerian guests told us that in southern Algeria, the climate is extremely hot, and each water well is far apart. In battle, water is the most precious thing. When the National Liberation Army was fighting in an area called "Blue Spring," the women in this area braved the rain of bullets in every battle and carried water to the commanders and fighters of the National Liberation Army. On the way, many women were shot by enemy bullets and fell in pools of blood, but the living people continued to carry water forward until they delivered the water to the mouths of the National Liberation Army soldiers.

The brutal French colonialists searched for wounded officers and soldiers of the National Liberation Army everywhere during the war, but they failed every time. Because, after the end of the battle, the local people immediately went to the battlefield to carry the wounded back to their homes to take care of them carefully and buried the bodies of the sacrificed soldiers. Women and children also went to the battlefield to collect guns and ammunition and send them to the National Liberation Army so that they could continue to strike the invaders.

The people love the army, and the army loves the people even more. Whenever the French colonial army carried out inhumane massacres and looting of the innocent people, the soldiers of the National Liberation Army gave the enemy a devastating blow with an irreconcilable hatred, saving thousands upon thousands of people from the sea of fire and the butcher's knife. Doctors and nurses of the National Liberation Army often stayed up all night to treat the wounded masses. The army shared its supplies with the masses, they ran schools to accommodate the children of poor people, and they allocated a certain amount of money every month to help the poor people and the families of the soldiers...

An army that is flesh and blood with the people is the most vibrant army. Minister Cherif was right: "We are fighting on our own land, the people support us, we are full of confidence, we are invincible!"

As our conversation came to an end, Minister Youssef Ben Khedda said earnestly: "Today, the Algerian people are fighting. Relying on self-reliance, relying on the unity of international anti-imperialist forces, relying on the unity of the people of Asia and Africa, the Algerian people will surely win. We are confident that in our struggle for national independence, the 600 million Chinese people are standing with us!"

Fight more bravely, heroic Algerian comrades-in-arms! In the years to come, you can always count on the firm support of the 650 million Chinese people. Final victory must be yours! (Attached photo)

    不可战胜的人民
    ——阿尔及利亚政府代表团访问记
    新华社记者  袁木  于民生
    “今天，阿尔及利亚民族解放军差不多已经控制着整个阿尔及利亚。法国殖民部队在那里随时都处于不安全的状态。”满脸红光的马哈茂德·谢里夫部长兴奋地告诉我们，他只要用这两句话就可以概括地表达出目前阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的胜利形势。
    这位英雄人民的使者打开了最近出版的一期“圣战者报”——阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的机关报，指着上面四幅标记着民族解放军四年战绩的阿尔及利亚军事地图，继续以充满胜利信心的语调对我们说：
    “在阿尔及利亚，不论是法国侵略部队或者是法国殖民者，他们到处都不敢单独行动。敌人那怕只作小小的转移，甚至只是到几公里以外的地方去取水，都要出动坦克或者飞机掩护。”
    “阿尔及利亚民族解放军的根据地正在不断扩大和巩固，它们周围的游击区也在不断延伸，许多主要地区都完全在我们的控制之下”，谢里夫部长指着地图上那些胜利的标记，兴奋地告诉我们：“尽管敌人在人力和装备上都比我们强大，但是，对于民族解放军的根据地，他们也不敢轻易冒犯。”
    “法国殖民部队现在还占领着我们的大城市和一些军事据点，但他们的占领也不得不付出很大的代价。殖民主义者在那里驻扎了大量的部队，筑起了许多堡垒、军事工事和电网，……即使是这样，敌人在他们占领的地区也是不安全的，城市里每天都有英勇的阿尔及利亚人的武装暴动。”
    谢里夫部长代表站在反殖民主义斗争最前线的人民发出的声音，生动地构成了阿尔及利亚民族解放运动正在胜利进军的图景。有着一百多年光荣斗争传统的阿尔及利亚人民，在最近四年的战斗中取得了辉煌的胜利，民族解放军已由几千人发展到十几万人。我们望着那些根据地和游击区在阿尔及利亚地图上不断扩大的胜利标志，看到那些光荣的土地重新回到阿尔及利亚人民的手里，不由得对在反对帝国主义共同斗争中的英雄战友，产生出无比崇敬的感情。
    “战斗着的阿尔及利亚人民都是英雄，在我们的土地上每天每时都涌现着许多可歌可泣的斗争事迹。”当我们希望阿尔及利亚贵宾介绍一些人民英勇斗争的故事时，优素福·本·赫达部长怀着对自己人民的骄傲，自豪地这样说。接着，贵宾们向我们谈到了许多动人事例，谈到了许多无名英雄。这些都使我们更加确信高举起民族解放旗帜的人民是永远不可战胜的。
    法国殖民者为了割断阿尔及利亚民族解放军同外界的联系，断绝他们的供应，在阿尔及利亚同摩洛哥和突尼斯接壤的边境上，筑起了一道长达几百公里的封锁线。这道封锁线上布下了三道电网，每道电网之间的宽度有三公尺到六公尺，当中到处都埋下了地雷。驻扎在这里的大量法国部队，在沿线筑起了许多钢筋水泥的碉堡。但是，这条法国殖民者自称为“铜墙铁壁”的封锁线，并没有封锁住英勇的阿尔及利亚人民。每天深夜，都有许多民族解放军的英雄战士，他们为了人民和祖国的荣誉，不惜牺牲自己的宝贵生命，争先恐后地自动报名，到这条封锁线上去打开许多缺口，源源运来民族解放军所需要的各种供应品。
    下面是贵宾们离开阿尔及利亚来我国访问以前新发生的一个战斗故事。一队民族解放军战士经过了整整一个夜晚的急行军，第二天清晨碰到了一支在人数和装备上比他们都强大得多的法国侵略部队。全副武装的敌人分乘着七辆汽车，还带有一门口径七十五公厘的大炮。战士们发现敌人以后，不顾长途行军的疲劳，立刻给了敌人一个突然袭击。民族解放军的战士虽然也遭到了很重的伤亡，但是他们终于打坏了所有的汽车，杀死了所有的敌人，缴获大批枪支、无线电台和那一门大炮。就在迅速地结束了这次战斗的那个夜晚，战士们用新缴获来的那门大炮，轰毁了敌人的一座堡垒。贵宾们在我们结束访问时送给了我们许多实地纪录民族解放军战斗生活的照片，其中有一张就是战士们正在使用那门大炮轰击敌人时拍摄下来的。
    “我们所讲的远不能表达出阿尔及利亚人民英勇斗争精神的万分之一。但是，从这里你们也可以看出，为了祖国的独立和自由，我们的人民是怎样地不惜付出一切代价。”优素福·本·赫达部长激动地说：“我们所面临的是一个有着六十万人的现代化武装部队的敌人，他们还有着大西洋集团国家特别是美国在军事上和财政上的支持。法国殖民者在我们的国土上残暴地轰炸乡镇，枪杀老人、妇女甚至儿童，焚毁房屋、森林和一切庄稼。一旦有那个乡村发现有一个法国殖民者的尸体，他们就焚毁整个村庄……，但是，所有这一切都没有能够征服英雄的人民，没有能够征服他们争取自由和独立的心！”
    两位部长告诉我们，在阿尔及利亚流传着这样两个感人的战斗事迹。有一支四十人的小部队，同几千人的法国殖民部队已经坚持战斗了整整五个昼夜。激战持续到第六天，战士们的口粮都吃光了。就在这个时刻，英雄们为祖国发动了不惜牺牲一切的一次进攻，他们终于从敌人手里夺来了粮食和马匹，又继续战斗下去……。另一个战斗发生在阿尔及利亚人民在1954年开始进行有组织的武装暴动的初期，那时候的斗争比现在还艰苦百倍。有十四位永垂不朽的人民英雄，在一个山区同敌人的一个师作战。战士们坚持战斗到第十个小时，十四人中已经牺牲了十三个人。最后的一位英雄自己毁掉了手里的武器，在不可征服的祖国土地上和敌人同归于尽，为自由和独立流尽了最后一滴鲜血。
    我们静静地听着贵宾们讲到这里，怎么也不能抑制内心的激动，忍不住向两位部长倾诉出我们自己的感情：“这样的人民是永远不可战胜的！这些可歌可泣的英雄业迹，不由得使我们联想到中国人民一百多年来反对帝国主义斗争的历史。我们两国人民在共同斗争中涌现出来的那些英雄人物是多么地相近啊！”
    “阿尔及利亚民族解放军依靠人民，爱护人民，人民也热爱军队，帮助军队，这就是我们的力量源泉和胜利保证！”优素福·本·赫达部长用简短的话语，表达了阿尔及利亚如鱼得水般的军民关系，更深刻地向我们道出了阿尔及利亚民族解放运动所以能胜利前进的关键所在。
    “我们的民族解放军和人民是形成一体的。在我们的国家里，没有一个家庭，没有子女不参加解放军，许多母亲的子女牺牲了，许多人被关在监狱里。很显然，我们的军队如果没有人民的支持，是不可能在强大的殖民武装下存在的。”谢里夫部长也用简短的几句话向我们介绍了这种军民关系的特征和重要意义。
    请听一听来自英雄国度的使者用朴素的语言讲述的一些阿尔及利亚人民支援民族解放军的事例吧！
    “我们国家的人民自动地给军队提供粮食、衣物、医药，甚至供给运输用的牲口。就连我们的伤兵也是在老百姓家里医治的。”
    “由于人民群众及时地提供了敌人活动的情报，使我们的军队能够准确地打击敌人，或者及时转移，避免敌人的袭击和遭受不应有的损失。”
    “每当一个民族解放军的指挥员为了战斗上的需要，不让敌人立足于自己的土地，而要毁掉某一块地区的时候，他就通过政委告诉群众，群众在规定的时间里立刻行动起来。”
      “在阿尔及利亚人人都是打击法国殖民军队的无畏战士，法国殖民军队到处受敌，时时不安，不论在城市或者是在乡村，每天都可以看到法国殖民军队的士兵被人民打死。”
    阿尔及利亚贵宾告诉我们，在阿尔及利亚南部，气候酷热，每一眼水井都相距很远。在战斗中，水是最宝贵的东西。民族解放军在一个叫“蓝色的泉水”的地区作战的时候，这个地区的妇女在每一次战斗中，都冒着枪林弹雨，背着水送给民族解放军的指战员喝。在途中，许多妇女被敌人的枪弹击中倒在血泊中，但活着的人仍然背着水继续前进，直到把水送到民族解放军战士们的嘴边。
    残暴的法国殖民主义者在战争期间到处搜捕民族解放军的受伤官兵，但他们每一次都失败了。因为，当地的人民在战斗结束以后，马上就到战场上把伤员背回自己家里经心地照护着，并且把牺牲的战士尸体掩埋好。妇女和孩子还到战场上收集枪支弹药，送给民族解放军，让他们继续打击侵略者。
    人民热爱军队，军队也更加爱护人民。每当法国殖民军队对善良的人民进行惨无人道的屠杀和掠夺的时候，民族解放军的战士就怀着不共戴天的仇恨给予敌人以歼灭性的打击，把成千成万的人民从火海里和屠刀下救了出来。民族解放军的医生和护士经常彻夜不眠，医治受伤的群众。军队把自己的给养同群众共同享受，他们办学校收容贫苦人民的子弟，每月都拨出一定的款项，接济贫苦人民和战士们的家属……。
    同人民血肉相连的军队是最有生命力的军队。谢里夫部长说得对：“我们在自己的土地上进行战斗，人民都支持我们，我们充满着信心，我们是不可战胜的！”
    在我们的谈话就要结束的时候，优素福·本·赫达部长恳切地说：“今天，阿尔及利亚人民正在战斗。依靠自力更生，依靠国际反帝国主义力量的团结，依靠亚非各国人民的团结，阿尔及利亚人民一定会取得胜利。我们确信，在我们争取民族独立的斗争中，六亿中国人民是同我们站在一起的！”
    更加勇敢的战斗吧，英雄的阿尔及利亚战友！在今后的岁月里，你们永远可以指望六亿五千万中国人民的坚决支持。最后胜利一定是你们的！（附图片）
