Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 26th: Pham Van Bach, Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held a press conference this afternoon to announce an open letter written by Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam on December 22nd.

In this letter, Premier Pham Van Dong once again suggested that the North and South of Vietnam hold talks in the near future to discuss and reach agreements on the following four issues:

I. On the military aspect: Both the South and the North shall not join any military alliance, shall not employ foreign military personnel in their own armies, and shall not build or expand military bases.

Both sides shall jointly reduce their armies, reduce their defense budgets, and increase budget expenditures for economic and social welfare undertakings in order to serve the material and cultural lives of the people.

II. On the economic aspect: Both sides shall reach agreements on the exchange of domestic products and mutual trade, with the aim of developing the economies of both the North and South and improving the lives of the people of both sides.

III. On the propaganda aspect: In order to create an atmosphere conducive to rapprochement and consultation between the two sides, both sides shall absolutely prohibit propaganda activities concerning war and the division of the North and South; both sides shall guarantee to strive to promote peace, national unity, and the unification of the motherland.

IV. On exchanges between the two sides: In order to realize normal exchanges between the two sides, first of all, the two sides shall allow cultural, scientific, economic, sports, and other organizations of both sides to visit and exchange experiences; allow women and children to visit relatives; and allow people of both sides to communicate freely.

The letter stated that the realization of the above suggestions will satisfy the urgent desires of the people of both sides in their current material and spiritual lives and will contribute to maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Premier Pham Van Dong said in the letter that on March 7th of this year, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent an open letter to the government of the Republic of Vietnam, suggesting that both sides hold talks as soon as possible to discuss the joint reduction of troops and mutual trade in order to create conditions for promoting mutual rapprochement and then peacefully unifying the motherland. However, until now, this open letter, like some previous open letters, has not received a response from the Southern authorities.

Premier Pham Van Dong then pointed out in the letter that since that time, due to the Southern authorities pursuing a policy of expanding armaments, preparing for war, increasing taxes, and persecuting the people under the pressure of American imperialism, coupled with American imperialism's economic plunder of South Vietnam, the lives of the South Vietnamese people have become extremely difficult. The letter emphasized that the above situation and the failure of Vietnam to achieve peaceful reunification are mainly caused by American imperialism's interference in South Vietnam.

Premier Pham Van Dong said in the letter that the era of imperialist colonialists enslaving nations has passed. Imperialism and colonialism have reached the time of decline; the policy of relying on imperialism and colonialism is bound to go bankrupt.

The letter stated that the current predicament of the South is the result of the Southern authorities' policy of relying on American imperialism. To get rid of this situation, the Southern authorities must change their current policy. The people of the whole country demand that the Southern authorities: abandon the policy of following American imperialism in strengthening military forces and preparing for war, abandon the policy of persecuting and killing patriotic people; establish an independent and autonomous economy, improve people's lives; expand freedom and democratic rights, and restore normal relations between the North and South. The letter pointed out that if the Southern authorities make the above changes in policy, they will be able to meet the urgent aspirations of the people of the whole country and will lay a good foundation for both sides to reach agreements beneficial to the motherland and the people through consultation, thereby opening the way for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The letter stated: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always believed that the issue of the reunification of our motherland and other issues concerning the interests of the people in both regions can and should be resolved through consultations between Vietnamese people, and no foreign interference is allowed. Therefore, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly suggested that both sides meet and consult, but the Southern authorities have not yet expressed any constructive attitude. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also always willing to discuss any practical suggestions put forward by the Southern authorities that are beneficial to the people and the cause of unifying the motherland.

    范文同总理写信给吴庭艳
    建议讨论有利于越南统一的问题
    要求南越当局改变依附美帝国主义的政策
    新华社河内26日电  越南民主共和国总理府部副部长范文白今天下午举行记者招待会，公布了越南民主共和国总理范文同在12月22日写给南越吴庭艳的一封公开信。
    范文同总理在这封信中，再次建议越南北南两方在最近期间举行会谈，以便就下列四个问题进行讨论和达成协议：
    一、在军事方面：南方和北方一律不加入任何军事联盟，在自己的军队中不任用外国军事人员，不增建或扩建军事基地。
    双方共同裁减军队，减少国防预算，增加经济和社会福利事业的预算开支，以便为人民的物质和文化生活服务。
    二、在经济方面：双方就国内产品的交流和互通贸易问题达成协议，其目的在于发展南北两方的经济和改善两方人民的生活。
    三、在宣传方面：为了造成有利于两方之间的接近和协商的气氛，双方绝对禁止关于战争、关于分裂南北两方的宣传活动；双方保证将努力宣传和平、民族团结和统一祖国。
    四、关于两方之间来往：为了实现两方之间的正常来往，首先双方将允许两方的文化、科学、经济、体育等组织能够来往参观和交流经验；允许妇女和儿童来往探亲；两方人民可以自由通信。
    信中说，上述建议的实现将满足两方人民在目前物质和精神生活方面的迫切愿望，并且将为维护东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。
    范文同总理在信中说，今年3月7日，越南民主共和国政府曾经寄给越南共和国政府一封公开信，建议双方及早举行会谈，商讨双方共同裁减军队和互通贸易的问题，以便为促进双方互相接近进而和平统一祖国创造条件。但是直到现在，这封公开信也像以前的一些公开信一样，没有得到南方当局的回答。
    范文同总理接着在信中指出这个时期以来由于南方当局在美帝国主义的压力下奉行扩军备战、加重税收和迫害人民的政策，加以美帝国主义对南越进行经济掠夺，因而使南越人民生活极端困苦的情况。信中着重指出，上述情况和越南不能实现和平统一主要是美帝国主义对南越进行干涉造成的。
    范文同总理在信中说，帝国主义殖民者奴役各民族的时代已经过去了。帝国主义和殖民主义已经到了没落的时候；依附于帝国主义和殖民主义的政策一定不能免于破产。
    信中说，南方当前所处的困境是南方当局依附美帝国主义的政策的结果，要摆脱这种境遇，南方当局就必须改变现行的政策。全国人民要求南方当局：抛弃追随美帝国主义进行增强军事力量和备战的政策，抛弃迫害和残杀爱国人民的政策；建立独立、自主的经济，改善人民生活；扩大自由民主权利，恢复北、南双方的正常关系。信中指出，南方当局如果在政策方面作出上述改变，将能满足全国人民的迫切愿望，并且将为双方通过协商以达成有利于祖国和人民的协议打下良好基础，从而为和平统一祖国开辟道路。
    信中说：越南民主共和国政府一贯认为，我们祖国的统一问题和有关两地人民利益的其它问题，都可以而且有必要通过越南人之间的协商来求得解决，不允许外国人进行任何干涉。因此，越南民主共和国政府曾经多次建议双方会面和协商，但是南方当局直到现在仍然没有表示过任何建设性的态度。越南民主共和国政府也随时愿意讨论南方当局提出的有利于人民和统一祖国事业的切实建议。
