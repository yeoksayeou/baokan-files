According to Shanxi Daily, the Hongxing United Cooperative in Changzi, Shanxi, criticized blind complacency and launched a mass wheat field management campaign.

The Hongxing United Cooperative sowed a total of 98,000 mu of wheat this year. The sowing quality was better than in any previous year: 70,000 mu were deep ploughed, with an average application of 40,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and the seed sowing was generally above 30 jin. Improved varieties have been popularized, resulting in vigorous and lush green wheat seedlings. Faced with this situation, some cooperative cadres and members developed a sense of complacency, saying: "The wheat seedlings are growing so well this year, we will have a good harvest even without management." The Party Committees of each commune, aiming at the blind complacency among cadres and the masses, launched a debate on the topic of "Can good seedlings turn bad if management is not strengthened?" During the debate, on the one hand, the dialectical relationship between good and bad was explained; on the other hand, those with complacency were reminded that although the wheat seedlings are growing well this year, they are not all good, and some wheat fields have even turned yellow. Through the debate, the complacency of many people was eliminated, and they realized that managing the wheat fields well is the first shot in next year's greater leap forward in agricultural production. Thus, a mass campaign for wheat field management was launched.

In order to ensure that the wheat field management work is carried out thoroughly, the United Cooperative, led by the Party Secretary and Director, formed a Wheat Field Management Committee, and similar organizations were established in each commune and team. The entire United Cooperative was divided into six war zones, and the wheat field management work was divided into four campaigns: the first campaign was to check and replenish seedlings, which was completed before the end of November; December is the second campaign, mainly focusing on topdressing and watering; January to March next year is the third campaign, with the task of harrowing, rolling, inter-tillage, and applying secondary topdressing; the fourth campaign is late-stage management. There are specific requirements for topdressing and watering.

Currently, the second campaign, centered on winter topdressing and winter watering, has been launched, and the competition between communes, teams, and individuals has become a hot topic. The slogan put forward by the members is: "The Secretary takes command, the whole people charge, we will never retreat without a complete victory!"

    克服自满建立专业组织
    山西红星联社加强麦田管理
    据山西日报消息  山西长子红星联社批判了盲目自满情绪，掀起了群众性的麦田加工运动。
    红星联社今年共播种小麦九万八千亩。播种质量比以往任何一年都好：有七万亩经过深翻，平均亩施肥四万斤，下籽一般都在三十斤以上，良种已经普及，因而麦苗旺盛，一片油绿。面对这种情况，在某些社干部和社员中，产生了自满情绪，他们说：今年麦苗长得这样好，不用加工也要丰收。各公社党委会针对干部和群众中所存在的盲目自满情绪，以“好苗不加强管理能不能变坏”为题，发动大家鸣放辩论。在辩论中，一方面说明了好和坏的辩证关系；一方面提醒有自满情绪的人，今年麦苗虽然长得好，但不是块块好，少数麦田甚至已经发黄。通过辩论，许多人中间的自满情绪消除了，认识了把麦田管理好，就是打响了明年农业生产更大跃进的第一炮。于是，一个群众性的麦田加工运动展开了。
    为了把麦田加工工作抓到底，联社由党委书记、主任为首，组成麦田管理委员会，各公社和队也建立同样的组织。全联社划为六个战区，把麦田管理工作分为四次战役：第一次战役是查苗补苗，已于11月底以前完成；12月份是第二次战役，主要是追肥浇水；明年1月至3月为第三次战役，任务是耙耢、镇压、中耕、施二次追肥；第四次战役是后期加工。追肥、浇水都有具体要求。
    目前，以冬追、冬浇为中心的第二次战役已经展开，公社与公社、队与队、人与人之间的竞赛运动，已搞得热火朝天，社员们提出的口号是：“书记挂帅，全民冲锋，不获全胜，绝不收兵”！
