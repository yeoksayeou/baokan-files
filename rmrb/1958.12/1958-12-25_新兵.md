New Recruits
By Our Reporters Yin Chongjing and Huang Jun
　　On a piece of land on the left bank of the Hai River in Bohai Bay, just a few months ago, it was still a quiet field. Now, a large eight-story steel plant, more than half a mile long, has been erected. The thick smoke spewed out by a row of fifteen large converters and smelting furnaces is like giant dragons tumbling in the air; busy trains directly transport tens of thousands of tons of steel ingots from the factory to the motherland. This factory is the Tianjin Steel Plant No. 2 Factory.
　　This is a leading steel plant on the North China Plain. Here, people see that with the great development of industry, the ranks of the working class are growing stronger. Young farmers, students, small vendors, members of handicraft cooperatives... have entered the factories one after another. In the battle for steel, under the education of party organizations and the help of veteran workers, they are gradually overcoming the ideological consciousness of the petty bourgeoisie, and the style of the working class is taking shape.

　　The Masters of the Land Become
　　the Masters of the Factory

　　At the westernmost end of the factory building, there is an eighteen-year-old young worker named Cheng Zhuyun, who often excitedly points to the No. 1 steel casting pool and says to people: "Under this pool, I personally planted potatoes and Chinese cabbage for more than four years. Today, rows of fiery red steel ingots are growing here. The more I look at it, the happier I am." It turns out that the foundation of this factory building was originally a garden field of the "Mantianhong" Agricultural Cooperative. Cheng Zhuyun was a member of this agricultural cooperative, and the section of land under the No. 1 steel casting pool was precisely the fruits of struggle he had obtained during land reform. In July of this year, the members of "Mantianhong" heard that a steel plant was to be built on their land, and they were all overjoyed. They did not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the small collective, and they themselves pulled out the various growing vegetables, leveled the ground, and provided it to the steel plant for use. Many farmers, in order to support the steel commander's rise to power, entered the factory to work at the request of the steel plant. Cheng Zhuyun was one of them.
　　Cheng Zhuyun is the son of a poor peasant. He lost his parents when he was young and followed his grandmother begging everywhere, suffering all kinds of pain and hardship. Only after liberation did he turn over, first dividing the land, then joining the agricultural cooperative, and now joining the ranks of the working class. He often says: In the past, we were the masters of the land, now we are the masters of the factory. The steel plant is our home, and we must learn from the veteran workers and inherit their noble qualities. Cheng Zhuyun's current specific position is as a loading, unloading, and escort worker in the raw material section. Because of his hard work, he became familiar with various businesses in less than twenty days.

　　Enlisting on the Iron and Steel Front

　　In the middle of the huge factory building are the No. 5 and No. 6 converters. Here, there is often a young worker named Zhang Guangyuan. His diligent and skilled movements would lead people who don't know him to believe that he is a veteran steelworker, but in reality, he is just a high school graduate who just entered the factory this year!
　　This summer, Zhang Guangyuan had already signed up to prepare for the entrance examination to Peking University, but he suddenly heard that the Tianjin Steel Plant was undergoing a major expansion and urgently needed new workers, so he signed up and came to the steel plant. Soon, the university held entrance examinations, and some classmates advised him to quickly take the entrance examination. Zhang Guangyuan originally wanted to go to university, and his classmates said so, and he really wanted to leave. However, the magnificent factory buildings that were rising day by day on the construction site attracted him and made him reluctant to leave. He thought: Could it be that he could not withstand the test in this torrent of life? … At this time, he learned of Chairman Mao's inspection in Tianjin and heard Chairman Mao's important instructions: "One is grain, the other is steel. With these two things, everything will be easy." The more Zhang Guangyuan thought about it, the more enthusiastic he became. He never expected that the steel plant he was personally building was so important! So, he made up his mind to "enlist" on the iron and steel front. But new twists and turns came again. A few days later, he received a letter from the Tianjin No. 1 Iron and Steel Industry School, inviting him to be a teacher. For this reason, his classmates specially came to persuade him, saying: Being a worker in a steel plant, you can't learn anything. Life in a steel school is quiet and there is an opportunity to study. How good! A question mark flashed in Zhang Guangyuan's mind. In the end, he did not waver. It was on this evening that the master worker taught him for the first time to practice using a steel spoon to scoop steel water samples from the boiling converter. When he first took the field, he felt a little flustered and did not strictly follow the operating procedures. A tongue of fire of more than 1,000 degrees suddenly struck, burning his nose and left cheek. His classmates again advised him, saying: Why bother. As a result, his classmates were convinced by him.
　　After Zhang Guangyuan went to work, he quietly observed how the master workers operated. After daily hard work, hard study, and research on technology, he basically mastered general operating techniques in about a month or so. Now, the leadership has announced that he will officially serve as the second assistant steelmaker.

　　Mason Becomes Repair Furnace Worker

　　Furnace builder Sun Haishui was originally a mason. For many years, he only built walls, plastered walls, built stoves, and repaired roofs for city residents. As for repairing and building furnaces on steelmaking furnaces with raging flames, such arduous and glorious work, he had never done it, never seen it, and never even thought about it in the past. At the beginning, he was indeed a little timid and his thinking was a bit shaken. However, under the constant education of the party organization and the veteran workers, his thinking gradually stabilized and his courage gradually grew.
　　December 6th was the day when the factory organized high production. The whole factory was producing under high pressure, and everyone was excited. At eight o'clock in the morning, the twenty-fourth furnace of steel water from the No. 5 converter where Sun Haishui was located had been refined. The turntable machine on the control panel was started, and the huge converter slowly tilted forward, preparing to allow the steelworkers to skim off the slag. In an instant, at the interface between the furnace body and the furnace cap, because the dolomite bricks in the furnace were corroded and the steel plate of the furnace wall was penetrated by steel water, a bowl-sized hole opened with a "whoosh," and the steel water carrying flames rushed out. The workers in the control room became nervous and quickly started the controller to turn the furnace back to its correct position. At this time, the fourteen tons of steel water in the furnace were in a very critical situation. If the slag could not be skimmed off for a long time and the steel was delayed, it would only be scrapped. At this critical moment, Sun Haishui appeared. He carried a bucket of magnesia mud, jumped onto the high springboard, and braving the flames coming towards him, quickly applied the magnesia mud to block the running steel outlet. He wished he could block it in a second. He used a shovel, but he felt it was not fast enough, so he threw away the shovel and directly grabbed the mud with his hands and rushed up. After applying fifty or sixty handfuls of mud, the hole was finally blocked and the steel water was not damaged.

　　Learning From Veteran Soldiers

　　On the night of November 4th, the workshop was as usual, with the steelmaking furnace spewing out brilliant flames, the blower making a roaring sound, and the overhead crane hoisting steel ladles back and forth in the air. The whole factory was filled with a fiery atmosphere of battle. Suddenly, the No. 8 converter became particularly tense. It turned out that the hoist for loading materials was broken, and the supply of lime, ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, and fluorite to be added to the steelmaking furnace was interrupted. It would take two or three hours to wait for the hoist to be repaired. What to do, seeing that production was about to stop? Chen Fengzhi, a worker in the material transportation team, immediately proposed to the other five material transportation workers without hesitation: "The hoist is broken, and we can't just watch production be affected. We will carry it, and we must carry the materials up." His companions all agreed with his suggestion, but the furnace platform was more than ten feet high, and the ladder was narrow and steep, so it could not be carried up. At this time, Chen Fengzhi came up with an idea in his haste. He found many sacks, filled them with lime, ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, and fluorite, and took the lead in carrying them one bag at a time. He carried them for three hours in one go, and more than five tons of materials were continuously transported to the side of the furnace. Not only did he save this furnace of steel water, but also ensured the normal production of three furnaces of converter steel within three hours without a hoist. On that cold winter night, people were wearing cotton coats and still shivering from the cold, but Chen Fengzhi's clothes were soaked with sweat, and his strong will dispelled the fatigue of his whole body.
　　Chen Fengzhi used to be an urban resident. Why does this new worker have such enthusiasm? When people asked him, his answer was: "As soon as I see something wrong with the furnace, I immediately think: Although I am a new worker, like the veteran workers, I bear a glorious burden; the qualities of the veteran workers have a great influence on us, and we must always learn from them."

    新兵
    本报记者  尹崇敬  黄军
    渤海湾内海河左岸的一片土地上，几个月前还是一片静悄悄的原野。现在，一座八层楼高半里多长的大炼钢厂已经矗立起来。一排十五座大型转炉和化铁炉喷出的浓烟，像一条条巨龙在空中翻腾；忙碌的火车直接从厂房内把成千上万吨的钢锭给祖国运送出来。这个厂就是天津钢厂第二厂。
    这是一座华北平原上首屈一指的炼钢厂，在这里人们看到了随着工业的大发展，工人阶级的队伍正在发展壮大，年青的农民、学生、小商贩、手工业合作社的社员……纷纷走进了工厂。他们在为钢而战中，在党组织的教育和老工人的帮助下，正逐渐地克服着小资产阶级的思想意识，工人阶级的风格正在形成。
  土地的主人变成
    了工厂的主人
    在厂房的最西头，有一位十八岁的青年工人程竹云，常常兴奋地指着一号铸钢池对人说：“在这个池子的下面，我曾经亲手种过四年多土豆和大白菜，今天这里却长出了一排排火红的钢锭，我真是越看越高兴。”原来，这座厂房的地基前身是“满天红”农业社的一片园田，程竹云是这个农业社的社员，而一号铸钢池下面的那一段土地，正是他土改时分得的斗争果实。今年7月间，“满天红”的社员们听说要在自己的土地上建设炼钢厂，个个兴高彩烈，不惜牺牲小集体的利益，自己动手把正在生长着的各种蔬菜拔掉，平整一新，供给钢厂使用，不少农民为了支援钢帅升帐，应钢厂要求，进厂作工了，程竹云就是其中的一个。
    程竹云是个贫农的儿子，从小失去了爹妈，跟着奶奶到处乞讨，受尽了痛苦辛酸，解放后才翻了身，先分得了土地，后加入了农业社，现在又参加了工人阶级的队伍。他常常这样说：过去我们是土地的主人，现在是工厂的主人，钢厂就是我们的家，我们要好好地向老工人学习，把他们的高贵品质继承下来。程竹云现在的具体岗位是在原料工段作装卸押运员，由于他努力学习，不到二十天就熟悉了各种业务。
        在钢铁战线上入伍
    在巨大的厂房中间，是五号和六号转炉，这里，经常有一个名叫张广元的青年工人，他那勤快而熟练的动作，不了解的人，准以为他是个老炼钢工人，其实不过是今年刚进厂的高中毕业生！
    今年暑期，张广元已经报名准备投考北京大学了，但他忽然听说天津钢厂进行大扩建，迫切需要新工人，他就报名来到了钢厂。不久，大学举行入学考试，有的同学劝他快参加升学考试去，张广元本来就想读大学，同学这么一说，真想一走了事。但是工地上一天天耸立起来的宏伟厂房，又吸引着他舍不得离开，他想：难道自己在这生活的激流里经不起考验吗？……这时候，他知道了毛主席在天津视察的消息，听说了毛主席的重要指示：“一个粮食，一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了”。张广元越琢磨心里越热呼，想不到自己正在亲手建设的钢厂居然这么重要！于是，他下定决心在钢铁战线上“入伍”了。可是新的波折又来了，不几天，他接到天津第一钢铁工业学校的一封信，聘请他去当教员。为此，同学们特地跑来劝他说：在钢厂当工人，学不到什么，钢校生活安静，又有机会读书，多好！一个问号在张广元的心中转了一下。最后，他并没有动摇。正是这天晚上，师傅第一次教他练习用钢勺到沸腾的转炉内舀钢水样，初次上阵，他心里有些发慌，又没有严格按照操作规程去作。一千多度的火舌猛然袭来，灼伤了他的鼻子和左腮。同学们又劝他说：这何苦来。结果同学们被他说服了。
    张广元上班以后，就悄悄地观察老师傅是怎样操作的，经过每天勤学苦练，钻研技术，前后一个多月的时间，就基本上掌握了一般操作技术。现在领导上已宣布他正式担任炼钢第二助手。
        泥水匠成了修炉工
    砌炉工孙海水，原来是个泥水匠，多少年来只给市民家内砌个墙、抹个灰，作作炉灶、修修房顶，至于到烈焰翻腾的炼钢炉上来修炉、砌炉，这样艰巨而又光荣的活儿，过去不但没作过、没看过，连想也没想过。开始时，确实有些胆怯，思想也有些动摇。但是，他在党组织和老师傅的不断教育下，思想逐渐稳定下来，胆子也逐渐壮起来了。
    12月6日，是厂内组织高产的日子，全厂生产紧张，人人心情激动。早晨八点钟，孙海水所在的五号转炉第二十四炉钢水已经炼成了，操纵台上的转盘机开动了，魁伟的转炉徐徐地向前倾侧过来，准备让炼钢工人们扒渣子，刹那间，炉身和炉帽接口的地方，由于炉内白云石砖被浸蚀，炉墙钢板被钢水穿透了，“呼”的一声，开了碗口大的窟窿，卷着烈火的钢水冲了出来。操纵室里的工人紧张起来了，赶快开动控制器，把炉子转正了回去。这时，炉内的十四吨钢水处在非常危急的境地，要是老不能扒渣，耽误出钢，只有报废了。在这紧要关头，孙海水出现了。他提了一桶镁砂泥，跳上高高的跳板，冒着迎面喷来的火焰，飞速地将镁砂泥向跑钢口堵去。他恨不得在一秒钟内就堵好。使的是铲子，他嫌干得不快，扔了铲子，就直接用手抓泥扑将上去。先后扑了五、六十把泥，窟窿终于堵住了，钢水并没有受到损失。
          向老战士学习
    11月4日夜晚，车间里和往常一样，炼钢炉吐着灿烂的火焰，鼓风机发出隆隆的吼声，天车吊起一个个的钢水包在空中来来去去，全厂到处弥漫着一片炽热的战斗气氛。突然间，八号转炉上格外紧张起来，原来是装料的卷扬机坏了，需要加进炼钢炉的白灰、矽铁、锰铁、莹石供应中断了，等着修理卷扬机得两、三个钟头，眼看就要停产，怎么办呢？运料组工人陈凤治毫不犹豫地立即向其他五个运料工人提出：“卷扬机坏了，不能眼看着生产受影响，我们抬，也要把料抬上去。”同伴们都一致同意他的建议，但是炉台有一丈多高，梯子又窄又陡，抬不上去。这时，陈凤治急中生智，找来了许多麻袋，装上白灰、矽铁、锰铁和莹石，就带头一袋一袋的往上背，一气背了三个钟头，五吨多料源源不断地运到了炉旁，不但挽救了这一炉钢水，而且在三个钟头之内，在没有卷阳机的情况下，保证转炉正常地生产了三炉钢。在那寒冷的冬夜，人们穿着棉袄还冻得打战，可是陈凤治却被汗水浸透了衣衫，坚强的意志驱散了他全身的疲劳。
    陈凤治过去是一个城市居民，这个新工人为什么会有这样的干劲呢？当人们问他的时候，他的回答是：“一看到炉子出毛病，我立即就想到：我虽是一个新工人和老工人一样，肩负着光荣的重担；老工人的品质对我们影响很大，我们要永远向他们学习。”（附图片）
