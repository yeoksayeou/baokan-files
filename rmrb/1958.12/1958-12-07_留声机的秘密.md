    The Secret of the Gramophone
    Shen Jiwang, worker at the Xiaguan Iron Smelting Plant in Shangyu County, Zhejiang

    Master Tang Wanquan had a very delicate and exquisite gramophone at home, and its loud and melodious sound often attracted many listeners from the neighborhood. Later, the gramophone suddenly stopped working, and the people who had become addicted to listening went to his house to inquire about the reason. They saw Master Tang sitting at the Eight Immortals table, single-mindedly fiddling with a pile of gears of various sizes. According to him, the gramophone was broken, and these were all the gramophone's parts.

    From then on, the window of his house was always brightly lit late at night, and the glass window clearly reflected the shadow of a person working with rapt attention. During the day, Master Tang went to work carrying a lunch box, and people looked at his bloodshot eyes in surprise, always unable to resist asking him: "What exactly are you up to, staying up all night?" And he always answered with a smile, invariably: "Fixing the gramophone!"

    As time went on, not only did outsiders not believe it, but even his wife became suspicious.

    One day, his daughter came back from the countryside, and his wife specially prepared some side dishes. During the meal, the mother asked all sorts of questions and was extremely affectionate, but the father only cared about eating, and while eating, he even used his chopsticks to dip in the soup and draw small circles on the table. As he drew, he accidentally knocked over a bowl of shredded pickled mustard tuber with meat that his daughter loved to eat, splashing oil all over her. This time, his wife lost her temper: "You're getting senile, your mind is unclear, squatting in the house drawing circles all day long, even drawing circles while eating, what's wrong with you?" Master Tang also got angry, put down his rice bowl, and ran into the bedroom, hey! The father didn't look angry at all, and was sitting at the Eight Immortals table playing with the gramophone parts again. ...

    At night, Director Xie returned to the factory with his head down in thoughtful contemplation after attending a technical innovation and great leap forward meeting at the Ministry of Industry. Huh, why are there sparks flickering beside Blast Furnace No. 3? He approached the furnace silently and suddenly shouted: "Who's there!" He shone a flashlight and saw a person bending over, crouching on the blower. The blower's cover had been opened, and parts were scattered all over the ground.

    The person quickly turned around, squinting slightly at the light of the flashlight. Oh! It turned out to be Master Tang. Party Branch Secretary Old Chen was also there, struggling to move a part from the machine.

    "Old Xie is back, come over and help me hold it up, this thing is really heavy!"

    "What exactly are you doing?"

    "Didn't we discuss the problem of insufficient iron output from Blast Furnace No. 3 last time?" Secretary Chen took a breath and said slowly: "Master Tang has spent a full three months of effort on this matter. He is sure that the problem must be with the blower. He painstakingly researched a regulator that can increase the wind force by one-third..."

    "No, it can increase by half at its strongest." Master Tang corrected him.

    "Oh, that's amazing!" The factory director patted Master Tang's broad shoulders affectionately. "How did you figure it out?"

    "To put it bluntly, there's really nothing to it." Master Tang became uneasy. "I saw that the 'governor' of the gramophone turns fast, and I thought that it would be great if one could be installed on the blower as well!"

    The secret of repairing the gramophone was thus revealed.

    留声机的秘密
    浙江上虞县下管炼铁厂工人  沈暨王
    唐万泉师傅家里有只十分精巧玲珑的留声机，嘹亮悦耳的声音常常吸引来左邻右舍许多听众。后来留声机突然不哼气了，听上了瘾的人们去他家探听原因。只见唐师傅正坐在八仙桌前，一心一意地摆弄着一堆大大小小的齿轮。据他说留声机坏了，这都是那留声机的零件。
    从此他家窗前，每天深夜总是雪亮一片，玻璃窗里清晰地映出一个聚精会神工作着的人影子。白天唐师傅提着饭盒子上班去，人们惊奇地望着他那布满红丝的眼睛，总禁不住问他：“你夜夜不睡，究竟在搞些什么名堂？”他呢，也总是笑嘻嘻地千篇一律的回答：“修留声机呗！”
    日子一久，不但外人不相信，连他的老伴也疑惑起来了。
    一天，女儿从乡下回来，娘特意弄了几样小菜。席间，娘问长问短亲热得不得了，做爹的却只顾吃饭，一边吃一边还用筷子蘸着汤在桌子上划着小圈圈。划着，划着，一不小心将女儿最爱吃的一碗榨菜肉丝汤打翻了，溅了女儿一身油。这下老伴可发作了：“老糊涂，神智也不清了，一天到晚蹲在屋里划圆圈，吃饭也划起圈圈来了，你到底是怎么了？”骂得唐师傅也发了火，他把饭碗一放，就跑进卧室去，嘿！父亲哪里还像生气的样子，又坐在八仙桌前玩弄留声机零件了。……
    入夜，谢厂长从工业部开完技术革新跃进会议，低着头若有所思地走回厂来。咦，三号高炉旁怎么有点点星火在闪动？他不出声地走近炉旁，猛然喝道：“谁！”他用手电筒一照，只见一个人正弓着腰，曲身伏在鼓风机上。鼓风机已经被揭开了盖子，零件放了一地。
    那人急速地回过头来，朝着手电筒的亮光，微微地眯起眼睛。哦！原来是唐师傅。党支书老陈也在，他正吃力地把一样零件从机器上搬下来。
    “老谢回来啦，快过来帮我托住它，这鬼东西真沉！”
    “你们究竟在干什么呀？”
    “前次我们不是研究过三号高炉出铁量太少的问题吗？”陈支书透了口气，缓缓地说：“为这事唐师傅已经足足花了三个月的心血。他看准了毛病一定出在鼓风机上。他苦心地钻研了一架调节机，可以使风力增加三分之一……”
    “不，最强时可以增加一半。”唐师傅纠正他的话。
    “哦，了不起！”厂长亲热地拍拍唐师傅宽阔的肩膀。“你怎样研究出来的呢？”
    “说穿了，实在也没有什么。”唐师傅忸怩不安起来。“我看到留声机的‘发司’转得快，就联想到要是鼓风机上也能配上一个，多好呢！”
    修留声机的秘密，从此也就真相大白了。
