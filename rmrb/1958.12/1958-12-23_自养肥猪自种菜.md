    Raising Hogs and Growing Vegetables Ourselves
    According to Yunnan Daily: The laborers of the Gongnong Yuejin (Worker-Peasant Leap Forward) ditch in Mengzi County, Yunnan, grow vegetables and raise pigs themselves on the construction site. They often eat fresh vegetables, oil, and meat. Everyone is healthy, and they are full of energy, constantly improving work efficiency.
    The Gongnong Yuejin ditch, which started construction this year in Mengzi County, is eighty kilometers long. The entire ditch is built in high mountain areas, far from villages and towns. The vegetables and meat needed by the more than seven thousand laborers participating in the ditch construction depend on outside support, but transportation is very inconvenient. In order to ensure that the construction site has fresh vegetables and meat, the construction site leaders called on all laborers to use their spare time to grow vegetables and raise pigs on the barren hills and wastelands near the construction site, to achieve self-reliance and reduce the burden on the state and the commune, as well as transportation labor. This measure was warmly supported by all the laborers, and everyone actively planted vegetables and raised pigs. As a result, each person can eat one and a half to two pounds of vegetables every day, and each person can eat half a catty to a catty of pork every month. In order to let the laborers eat well in the New Year, they have now made further arrangements.

    自养肥猪自种菜
    据云南日报消息：云南蒙自县工农跃进大沟的民工自己在工地上种菜、养猪，经常能吃到新鲜蔬菜和油、肉，人人身体健康，个个干劲十足，工效不断提高。
    蒙自县今年动工兴修的工农跃进大沟全长八十公里，整个沟道都修筑在高山地带，距村镇很远，参加兴修水沟的七千多个民工需要的蔬菜和肉类，靠外边支援。而运输却很不方便。为了保证工地吃上新鲜蔬菜和肉类，工地领导号召全体民工利用生产空隙时间，在工地附近的荒山荒地上大种蔬菜和养猪，做到自力更生，减少国家和公社的负担与运输劳力。这一措施提出后，受到了全体民工的热烈拥护，大家积极种菜、喂猪。因此每人每天都能吃到一斤半到两斤蔬菜，每人每月能吃到半斤至一斤猪肉。为了让民工们新年吃得好，他们现在已作进一步的安排。
