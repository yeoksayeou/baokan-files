    To Consolidate the Foundation for a Greater and More Comprehensive Leap Forward
    Guangdong Launches a Massive Rectification Movement of Communes

    (Our Dispatch) A movement to rectify the People's Communes has unfolded with great momentum in various parts of Guangdong. After the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee implemented the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and made the decision to organize a ten-thousand-person inspection team to rectify and consolidate the People's Communes, up to now, local Party committees have convened cadre conferences of four to five thousand people, with the focus on commune rectification. Subsequently, local Party committees dispatched more than two thousand people to the countryside to carry out commune rectification work. At the prefectural and county levels, key areas were selected systematically for experimentation in order to gain experience and promote it in a timely manner. Generally, the first secretary of the commune Party committee personally took the lead, selecting a production brigade for pilot projects. Some areas with faster progress have already launched a mass upsurge of "big blooming, big contending." In Fanshun County, members of four key communes and twelve key production brigades wrote more than 50,000 big-character posters in three days.

    A total of 772 People's Communes have been established in the rural areas of Guangdong Province. With this year's extraordinary bumper harvest of grain, since mid-October, all People's Communes have universally implemented a system of food supply without payment, with three meals of dry rice a day. The vast majority of People's Communes throughout the province have already issued wages once, with an average of three or four yuan, or five or six yuan, per member. Some counties have already issued wages twice. Counties or communes that have not yet issued wages can generally issue them by the end of this month. The implementation of the wage-plus-food-supply distribution system in the People's Communes has caused jubilation everywhere in the countryside. Not only is food without payment supported by the general poor peasants, but also some well-to-do middle peasants have been educated by it. A well-to-do middle peasant in the Zhanjiang area said: "I have been the head of the family for decades, and I have never dared to promise my family one meal of dry rice a day; the Communist Party has been in power for less than ten years, and it can let all the peasants in the province eat three meals of dry rice a day. How can I not admire it?" Many peasant women, when they received their wages for the first time, were beaming with joy. They wrapped the banknotes in layers of red paper, and finally wrapped them in red cloth. A middle-aged woman in Dianbai County said: "I have been married for twenty years, and my husband has never given me a penny. As soon as the People's Commune was established, it gave me six yuan at once. I would even move the sky if they asked me to!" Because of this, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been unprecedentedly high. Although the regulation guaranteeing farmers eight hours of sleep has been repeatedly emphasized, there are still many farmers who automatically, or even secretly, go to work early and return late from work. A woman in Xuwen County even carries four buckets of water at a time when she carries water.

    The People's Communes are very good, the vast majority of people are jubilant, and the countryside has taken a big step towards building a socialist society. However, the People's Communes still have many problems that need to be solved urgently. After conducting investigations and research in many aspects in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to launch a rectification movement of the People's Communes with the same vigor as the land reform and cooperativization, in order to consolidate this new system and lay a solid foundation for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward next year. This movement requires improving the organizational system of the communes, quickly clearing up and rectifying household affairs, and immediately overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of labor management; it requires correctly implementing the distribution system combining the wage system and the food supply system, ensuring that more than 90% of the members increase their income, and the remaining 10% of the members do not decrease their income. In terms of living welfare, it is necessary to immediately guarantee the masses' sleep and rest, and run collective living welfare undertakings well. It is stipulated that public canteens must achieve "twelve goods": (1) good rice, (2) good dishes, (3) good water supply, (4) good canteen production, (5) good cleanliness and hygiene, (6) good restaurant equipment, (7) good tool reform, (8) good canteen organization and security, (9) good saving of service personnel, (10) good protection of public property and strict economy, (11) good democratic management, (12) good service attitude of canteen staff and good observance of canteen order by the masses. It is stipulated that nurseries, kindergartens and homes for the elderly should be: good food, good hygiene, convenient for the masses and saving service personnel, good working attitude of service personnel; in addition, nurseries and kindergartens should also teach well.

    In addition to effectively solving the above problems in this commune rectification movement, it is also necessary to once again conduct socialist and communist ideological education among the masses, clarify some people's misunderstandings about the People's Communes; the individualism, departmentalism, and capitalist ideas exposed in the big blooming and big contending should also be debated and distinguished between right and wrong to improve the masses' awareness. At the same time, summarizing this year's leap forward and planning next year's production should also be included as one of the contents of the commune rectification.

    Now, the commune rectification movement is selecting some communes for key experiments on the one hand, and solving a number of outstanding problems in general People's Communes on the other hand. For example, in order to immediately improve the living welfare work of the communes, the Zhanjiang Special Zone has transferred eight thousand cadres, including leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government, to public canteens to work as cooks, and more than one thousand female cadres to nurseries and kindergartens to work as childcare workers, in order to better discover existing problems and find out the experience of doing a good job in collective welfare undertakings from practice.

### 为更大更全面地跃进扎稳根基  广东整顿公社运动声势浩大

    为更大更全面地跃进扎稳根基
    广东整顿公社运动声势浩大
    本报讯  整顿人民公社的运动已在广东各地声势浩大地展开。在广东省委贯彻执行党的八届六中全会决议，作出了组织万人检查团整顿和巩固人民公社的决定以后，到目前为止，各地委都召开了以整社为中心内容的四、五千人的干部大会。随后各地委都派出两千多人下乡进行整社工作。地、县两级还选定了自己的重点，有系统地进行试验，以便取得经验，及时推广。一般人民公社也由公社党委第一书记动手，选择一个生产大队进行试点。一些进展较快的地区已掀起了群众性的大鸣大放热潮，番顺县四个重点社和十二个重点生产大队的社员，在三天内就写了五万多张大字报。
    广东全省农村一共建立了七百七十二个人民公社，随着今年粮食的特大丰收，从10月中旬起，所有人民公社普遍实行了吃饭不要钱的伙食供给制，并且是一天三顿干饭。全省绝大多数人民公社，已发放过一次工资，平均每个社员都领到三、四元，或者五、六元不等的工资。有些县已经发过两次。个别还没有发放工资的县或社，本月月底也可以普遍发下去。人民公社的工资加伙食供给的分配制度的实行，使农村到处欢声雷动。吃饭不要钱，不仅一般比较贫苦的农民拥护，就是一部分富裕中农，也从中受到了教育。湛江地区一位富裕中农说：“我当了几十年家长，没敢答应家里人每天有一顿干饭；共产党执政不到十年，能让全省农民一天吃三顿干饭，怎能不佩服。”许多农家妇女，第一次领到工资的时候，真是眉开眼笑，乐不可支。她们用红纸，把钞票包了一层又一层，最后还用红布裹起来。电白县一位中年妇女说：“我嫁汉嫁了二十年，丈夫没有给过我一个钱，人民公社一成立，一次就给我发了六块钱，真是叫我去搬天我也干！”也因为这样，人民群众的生产积极性空前提高。保证农民八小时睡眠的规定，虽曾一再强调，但仍有不少农民自动地、甚至是偷偷地早出工和晚收工。徐闻县有个妇女，甚至担起水来，也要一次挑四个水桶。
    人民公社好得很，绝大多数人欢欣鼓舞，农村向着建成社会主义社会迈进了大大的一步。但是，人民公社还存在着许多急待解决的问题。广东省委根据党中央的指示，在多方面作了调查研究以后，决定要以搞土改、合作化同样的劲头来开展整顿人民公社运动，以巩固这个新的制度，为明年更大更全面的跃进扎稳根基。在这次运动中要求健全公社的组织制度，迅速清理和整顿家务，立即克服劳动管理的混乱现象；要求正确贯彻实行工资制和伙食供给制相结合的分配制度，保证90％以上的社员增加收入，其余10％的社员不减少收入。在生活福利方面，立即要做到保证群众的睡眠、休息，办好集体生活福利事业。规定公共食堂要做到“十二好”：（一）饭好，（二）菜好，（三）用水供应好，（四）食堂生产好，（五）清洁卫生好，（六）餐厅设备好，（七）工具改革好，（八）食堂组织保卫好，（九）节省服务人员好，（十）爱护公共财产、厉行节约好，（十一）民主管理好，（十二）食堂工作人员服务态度和群众遵守食堂秩序好。规定托儿所、幼儿园和敬老院要做到：吃得好，卫生好，方便群众、节约服务人员好，服务人员的工作态度好；此外，托儿所和幼儿园还要教得好。
    这次整社运动除开切实解决上面这些问题以外，还要再一次向群众进行社会主义和共产主义思想教育，澄清一些人对人民公社的一些误解；在大鸣大放中暴露出来的一些个人主义、本位主义以及资本主义思想，也要进行辩论、分清是非，以提高群众觉悟。同时还要把总结今年跃进、规划明年生产的总路线再教育的工作列为整社内容之一。
    现在，整社运动一方面正在选择一些公社进行重点试验，一方面在一般人民公社中解决一批突出问题。例如湛江专区为了立即改进公社的生活福利工作，有八千名干部，包括各级党政领导干部在内，被调到公共食堂去当炊事员，一千多名妇女干部到托儿所、幼儿园去作保育工作，以便更好的发现存在的问题，并从实践中找出做好集体福利事业的经验。
