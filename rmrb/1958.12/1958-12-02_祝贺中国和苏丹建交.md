    Congratulations on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Sudan
    On November 30th, Ibrahim Abboud, Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sudan, and Ahmed Kheir, Minister of Foreign Affairs, respectively sent telegrams to Chairman Mao Zedong and Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country, announcing the Sudanese government's decision to recognize the People's Republic of China. On December 1st, Chairman Mao Zedong and Foreign Minister Chen Yi of our country replied to Chairman Abboud and Foreign Minister Kheir, announcing our country's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Sudan. This is a major event in the history of relations between the people of China and Sudan and is worthy of our warm congratulations.
    China and Sudan are both participants in the Bandung Conference. Representatives of our two countries at the conference jointly condemned colonialism, upheld national independence, and advocated strengthening international friendship and cooperation. Both our governments actively support the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference. It is on this basis that the people of China and Sudan have established friendly relations. Now, our two countries have formally established diplomatic relations, which indicates a new development in the friendship between our two peoples.
    The Chinese people have always expressed deep concern for the long struggle of the Sudanese people for national independence. Despite the obstruction by the imperialists, the freedom-loving Sudanese people finally broke free from the shackles of colonialism and declared their independence on January 1, 1956. Our people are pleased with the victory achieved by the Sudanese people and sincerely hope that the Sudanese people will achieve greater success in consolidating national independence and developing economic construction.
    Since Sudan's independence, economic and cultural ties between our two countries have been increasing. Trade delegations, peace delegations, trade union delegations, cultural friendship delegations, women's delegations, and football teams from the Republic of Sudan have successively visited our country. Trade delegations, cultural and art delegations, trade union delegations, youth delegations, and football teams from our country have also visited Sudan. These exchanges have effectively enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries. We firmly believe that the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sudan will open up broad prospects for the further development of friendly relations between our two peoples. The Chinese people are willing to work with the Sudanese people, and with the people of all Arab countries, to continuously strengthen our friendly and cooperative relations and jointly safeguard peace in Asia and Africa.

    祝贺中国和苏丹建交
    11月30日，苏丹共和国武装部队最高委员会主席易卜拉欣·阿布德和外交部长艾哈迈德·赫尔分别致电我国毛泽东主席和外交部长陈毅，宣布苏丹政府决定承认中华人民共和国。12月1日，我国毛泽东主席和外交部长陈毅已复电阿布德主席和赫尔外交部长，宣布我国决定同苏丹共和国建立外交关系。这是中国和苏丹两国人民关系史上的一件大事，值得我们热烈庆贺。
    中国和苏丹都是万隆会议的参加国。我们两个国家的代表在会上同声谴责殖民主义，维护民族独立，主张加强国际间的友好和合作。我们两国政府都积极支持万隆会议所通过的十项原则。正是在这样的基础上，中国和苏丹两国人民建立了友好关系。现在，我们两个国家又正式建交，这表明我们两国人民的友谊又有了新的发展。
    中国人民对苏丹人民为争取民族独立而进行的长期斗争，一向表示深切的关怀。尽管帝国主义者横加阻挠，但是，爱好自由的苏丹人民，终于挣脱了殖民主义的枷锁，于1956年1月1日宣布独立。我国人民对苏丹人民所获得的胜利感到高兴，并且衷心希望苏丹人民在巩固民族独立和发展经济建设事业中获得更大的成就。
    苏丹独立后，我们两国之间的经济和文化联系日益增强。苏丹共和国政府贸易代表团、苏丹和平代表团、苏丹工会代表团、苏丹文化友好代表团、苏丹妇女代表团、苏丹共和国足球队，接连来到我国访问。我国贸易访问团、文化艺术代表团、工会代表团、青年代表团、足球队等，也先后访问了苏丹。这些来往有效地增进了两国人民的相互了解和友谊。我们深信，中国和苏丹正式建交，将为我们两国人民友好关系的进一步发展开辟广阔的前景。中国人民愿和苏丹人民一道，和阿拉伯各国人民一道，不断地为加强我们之间的友好合作关系和维护亚非地区的和平而共同努力。
