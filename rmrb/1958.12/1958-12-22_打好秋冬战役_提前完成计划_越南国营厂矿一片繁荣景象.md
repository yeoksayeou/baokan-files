Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 17th: Vice Minister of Industry of Vietnam, Vu Anh, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today that the total output value of Vietnam's state-owned industry in 1958 is expected to exceed the original annual plan by 2.6%, an increase of 37.6% compared to last year. He pointed out that Vietnam's industry will have greater development next year. He said that in 1959, the Ministry of Industry will build fifty-nine enterprises above the quota limit. The total output value of state-owned industry next year will increase by 41% compared to this year. Among them, coal will increase by 31.9%, chemical fertilizers will increase by 77.2%, cement will increase by 24%, cloth will increase by 30.2%, and tea will increase by 20.35%. The construction of a steel plant with an annual output of 200,000 tons of steel will also begin next year.

Vu Anh said that among the thirty-four enterprises under the Ministry of Industry of Vietnam, twenty-one have already completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. Some enterprises have even completed their plans two and a half months ahead of schedule.

Since the second half of this year, especially since October, a new atmosphere has emerged in Vietnam's state-owned factories and mines, and the enthusiasm of the workers has greatly increased. Their slogan is: "Fight well the autumn and winter campaign" and strive to complete the plan ahead of schedule. The Hanoi Machine Factory originally planned to build a small steelmaking furnace in two months, but the workers worked hard for seven days and nights and built the furnace. The Nam Dinh Textile Factory used to have an average of six automatic looms per person in the second quarter, but now it has increased to about ten.

Vu Anh said: An important factor in completing the plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota is that the Vietnam Labor Party launched the movement of "workers participating in management and cadres participating in labor" in state-owned factories and mines. President Ho Chi Minh and other leaders of the Party Central Committee often went to various factories to inspect and instruct work, which greatly promoted the development of the movement.

Vu Anh said: A movement of "dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act" has been formed among the workers. This movement has combined the hard work spirit of the workers with the spirit of research. Many companies have launched large-scale collaborations, which has greatly improved production efficiency.

### 打好秋冬战役  提前完成计划  越南国营厂矿一片繁荣景象

    打好秋冬战役  提前完成计划
    越南国营厂矿一片繁荣景象
    新华社河内17日电  越南工业部副部长武英今天对新华社记者说，预期1958年越南国营工业总产值将超出原定年度计划的2.6％，比去年增加37.6％。他指出，越南工业明年将有更大的发展。他说，1959年工业部将兴建五十九个限额以上的企业。明年国营工业的总产值将比今年增长41％。其中煤将增长31.9％，化学肥料将增长77.2％，水泥将增长24％，布将增长30.2％，茶叶将增长20.35％。明年还要开始兴建一座年产二十万吨钢的钢铁厂。
    武英说，目前越南工业部所属三十四个企业中，已经有二十一个提前和超额完成了今年年度生产计划，其中有些企业甚至比原定的时间提前了两个半月。
    从今年下半年，特别是10月份以来，越南国营厂矿出现了一片新气象，工人群众的劳动积极性大为提高。他们的口号是：“打好秋冬战役”，争取提前完成计划。河内机器厂原来计划在两个月内修建成一个小炼钢炉，但是职工们苦干了七昼夜，就把炉建成了。南定纺织厂第二季度每人平均看管六部自动织布机，现在提高到十部左右。
    武英说：提前和超额完成计划的重要因素，是越南劳动党在国营厂矿中发动了“工人参加管理、干部参加劳动”的运动。胡志明主席和党中央其他领导人经常到各工厂去视察和指示工作，对运动的开展起了很大的推动作用。
    武英说：在工人群众中间已经形成了一个“敢想、敢说、敢作”的运动。这个运动使得工人的苦干精神和钻研精神结合起来了。许多企业发动了大协作，使生产效率大大提高。
