Notes

    Left and Right

    After the French National Assembly election, Soustelle, de Gaulle's favorite, told reporters: "Among the old parties, only the Socialists can truly be called left." He also said, "The 'Union for the New Republic' has the same right to be called left in this regard."

    Anyone who has read Gogol's "Dead Souls" will remember how Chichikov's coachman, Selifan, scolded the silly girl who was leading them: "Can't even tell left from right. ... You clodhopper." It is very appropriate to use this sentence to rebuke Soustelle.

    But de Gaulle's propaganda minister is certainly not as confused as that silly girl, unable to distinguish left from right. The fact is that Soustelle himself stands on the extreme right, so what ordinary people say is on the right is on the left for him. In his opinion, since the Socialist Party is "left," and his "Union for the New Republic" stands on the same position as the Socialist Party, it naturally "has the same right to be called left."

    左与右
    戴高乐的宠臣苏斯戴尔在法国国民议会选举结束后对记者说：“在旧政党中，只有社会党人真正可以说是左的”，他又说：“‘保卫新共和联盟’在这方面也有同样的权利被称为左派。”
    读过果戈里的“死魂灵”的人都会记得乞乞科夫的马夫绥里方是怎样骂给他们带路的傻女孩子的：“连左右也分不清。……你这泥腿。”用这句话来斥责苏斯戴尔是很合适的。
    但是戴高乐的这位宣传部长当然并不真是像那个傻孩子那样糊涂，连左右也分不清。事实上是因为苏斯戴尔自己站在极右端，因此一般人说是在右边的东西，对他来说却是在左面的。在他看来社会党既然是“左”的，而他的“保卫新共和联盟”和社会党又是站在一个立场上，因此当然“有同样的权利被称为左派”。
