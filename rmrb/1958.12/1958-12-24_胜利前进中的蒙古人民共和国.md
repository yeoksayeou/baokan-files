    The Mongolian People's Republic is a fraternal nation bordering our country. Since the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution more than thirty years ago, the Mongolian people have achieved brilliant successes in building socialism.
    The Mongolian People's Republic is located north of our country. It is surrounded by mountains on its west, north, and east sides, and by the vast Gobi Desert on its south, forming a vast plain basin. It has vast grasslands and primeval forests, and extensive arable land in the north and west, suitable for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. Livestock and furs are important products of Mongolia. In addition, mineral resources are very abundant. Almost every province has coal deposits, and gold, silver, copper, iron, and oil are also abundant. The country has an area of 1,531,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 870,000. The capital is Ulaanbaatar.
    The Mongolian people are a nation with a long history and culture. Before the victory of the People's Revolution, the Mongolian people suffered cruel oppression and exploitation by their own feudal lords and foreign colonialists, living a very painful life. In 1911, during the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the Mongolian people launched an armed uprising, drove out the reactionary officials of the Qing government, and declared Mongolian autonomy. However, the fruits of the Mongolian people's victory were seized by feudal princes, and Mongolia became a feudal theocratic state. Later, Chinese warlords, supported by Japanese imperialism, invaded Mongolia and forced Mongolia to abolish its autonomy. In early 1921, Japanese imperialism supported the remnants of the Tsarist Russian regime and White Army elements in invading Mongolia, restoring the monarchical regime in Mongolia. However, the heroic Mongolian people remained steadfast in their struggle against all oppressors.
    Under the influence of the Great October Revolution, the leader of the Mongolian People's Revolution, Sukhe-Bator, led the establishment of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in March 1921. On July 11 of the same year, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the direct assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the Mongolian people overthrew the rule of domestic and foreign oppressors, established a people's revolutionary government, and achieved a great victory in the national democratic revolution. In August 1924, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held its Third Congress, which, based on the famous instructions of the great Lenin, formulated the party's general line of enabling Mongolia to bypass the stage of capitalist development and directly enter socialism. In November of the same year, the First Great People's Khural of Mongolia promulgated the first People's Constitution in Mongolian history, which formally proclaimed the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic.
    After the victory of the People's Revolution, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party led the Mongolian people in carrying out tremendous social and economic reforms. From 1924 to 1940, Mongolia basically completed the arduous task of eliminating feudalism. In 1940, a new constitution was promulgated, declaring the basic completion of the Mongolian democratic revolution, and the Mongolian people entered a new stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have victoriously completed two five-year plans (1948-52 and 1953-57) for developing the national economy and culture. Starting this year, the Mongolian people have entered a period of implementing a new three-year construction plan.
    Currently, the socialist structure of the Mongolian People's Republic has completely controlled many important economic sectors. Mongolia used to have only backward animal husbandry; in the past decade, socialist industry has achieved greater development. Now Mongolia's industrial output has accounted for 41% of the country's total agricultural, animal husbandry, and industrial output. The Mongolian People's Republic is no longer an agricultural and pastoral country, but an agricultural, pastoral, and industrial country.
    Animal husbandry, as the foundation of Mongolia's national economy, has been greatly developed. In the era of the People's Government, the number of livestock has increased two and a half times. Currently, 56% of herding households have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, an increase of 21% over last year, and the livestock in the cooperatives accounts for more than 60% of the total number of livestock.
    Mongolia's social and cultural undertakings have also greatly developed. Currently, one in every six people in the country is studying; for every 10,000 residents, there are 1,100 primary and secondary school students, 77 secondary specialized school students, and 62 university students. In 1957, the number of scientific workers increased 4.5 times compared to 1948. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated nationwide.
    With the continuous development of economic and cultural undertakings, the living standards of the Mongolian people have also been continuously improved. In the past five years, the wages of workers and staff have increased by 75%, and the actual income of herdsmen has increased by 60%.
    The people of China and Mongolia have close historical ties and a long-standing friendship. In 1952, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Mongolian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Tsedenbal signed the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement in Beijing, further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. In recent years, Sino-Mongolian cooperation in the fields of economy, culture, education, and science and technology has achieved great success. In 1957, the trade volume between China and Mongolia increased by 184.5% compared to 1952, and in 1958 it increased by more than 10% compared to 1957. Since 1951, through trade relations between the two countries, Mongolia has supplied China with more than 150,000 horses, strongly supporting China's agricultural production. This year, when China's agriculture is making a great leap forward, the Mongolian people have again donated 15,000 draft horses to our country, once again fully expressing their concern and support for China's socialist construction.

    胜利前进中的蒙古人民共和国
    蒙古人民共和国是和我国相邻的兄弟国家。自从蒙古人民革命胜利的三十多年以来，蒙古人民在建设社会主义的事业中，取得了光辉的成就。
    蒙古人民共和国位于我国的北面。它的西、北、东三面环山，南面被大戈壁沙漠围绕着，全国形成一个广大的平原盆地。境内有大草原和原始森林，北部和西部有广大可耕地，适合农牧业的发展。牲畜和皮毛等为蒙古的重要产物。此外矿藏很丰富，几乎每省都有煤的蕴藏，金、银、铜、铁和石油等矿物也很多。全国面积有一百五十三万一千平方公里，人口约有八十七万，首都是乌兰巴托。
    蒙古人民是一个有着悠久文化和历史的民族。在人民革命胜利前，蒙古人民长期遭受本国封建主和外国殖民主义者的残酷压迫和剥削，过着十分痛苦的生活。1911年在中国辛亥革命的时候，蒙古人民举行了武装起义，驱逐了清政府的反动官僚，宣告蒙古自治。但是蒙古人民的胜利果实被封建王公所窃取，蒙古成了一个封建神权国家。以后，中国军阀在日本帝国主义支持下又侵入蒙古，强迫蒙古取消自治。1921年初，日本帝国主义又支持帝俄余孽和白卫军分子侵入蒙古，再度恢复蒙古的君主政权。但是英勇的蒙古人民始终坚定不移地同一切压迫者进行斗争。
    在伟大十月革命的影响下，蒙古人民革命领袖苏赫—巴托尔在1921年3月领导建成了蒙古人民革命党。同年7月11日，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，在苏联红军的直接帮助下，推翻了国内外压迫者的统治，建立了人民革命政权，取得了民族民主革命的伟大胜利。1924年8月，蒙古人民革命党举行第三次代表大会，代表大会根据伟大列宁的著名指示，制订了使蒙古越过资本主义的发展阶段而直接进入社会主义的党的总路线。同年11月，蒙古第一届大人民呼拉尔颁布了蒙古历史上的第一部人民宪法，它正式宣告了蒙古人民共和国的成立。
    在人民革命胜利之后，蒙古人民革命党领导蒙古人民，进行了巨大的社会的和经济的改革。从1924年到1940年，蒙古基本上完成了消灭封建主义的艰巨任务。1940年颁布新的宪法，宣告蒙古民主革命基本完成，蒙古人民从此转入了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新阶段。
    在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，蒙古人民已经胜利地完成了发展国民经济和文化的两个五年计划（1948—52年和1953—57年）。从今年开始蒙古人民又进入了执行新的三年建设计划的时期。
    目前蒙古人民共和国的社会主义结构已经完全控制了许多重要经济部门。蒙古过去只有落后的畜牧业；近十年来社会主义工业获得了较大的发展。现在蒙古工业产量已经占全国农牧业和工业总产量的41％。蒙古人民共和国已经不再是一个农牧业的国家，而是一个农牧业、工业的国家了。
    作为蒙古国民经济基础的牧畜业已经有了很大的发展。在人民政权的年代里牲畜头数增加到两倍半。目前已有56％的牧户加入了农牧业合作社，比去年增加了21％，入社的牲畜占牲畜总头数的60％以上。
    蒙古的社会文化事业也有很大的发展。目前全国每六个人中就有一人在学习；每一万居民中就有一千一百个中小学生，七十七个中等专科学校学生，六十二个高等学校的学生。1957年科学工作者的数目比1948年增加了四点五倍。全国已经基本上消灭了文盲。
    随着经济和文化事业的不断发展，蒙古人民的生活水平也得到了不断提高。五年来，职工的工资增加了75％，牧民的实际收入增加了60％。
    中蒙两国人民在历史上有着密切的关系和悠久的友谊。1952年，我国周恩来总理和蒙古部长会议主席泽登巴尔在北京签订了中蒙经济及文化合作协定，进一步加强了两国的友好合作关系。几年来，中蒙两国在经济、文化、教育和科学技术方面的合作取得了很大的成就。1957年中蒙两国的贸易额比1952年增加了184.5％，1958年又比1957年增长10％以上。从1951年以来，通过两国贸易关系，蒙古已经供应了我国十五万多匹马，有力地支援了我国的农业生产。今年当我国农业大跃进的时候，蒙古人民又赠送我国一万五千头耕马，再一次充分表达了对我国社会主义建设的关怀和支持。  （新华社）
