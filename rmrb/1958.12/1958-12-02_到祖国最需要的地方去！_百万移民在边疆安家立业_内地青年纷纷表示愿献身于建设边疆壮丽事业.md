Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: "Go to the place where the motherland needs you most" has become the common aspiration and action of the broad masses of the people. Since 1955, 1.38 million people from the interior have moved to the Northwest, Northeast and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to develop and build the frontier. With incomparable heroic spirit, they have overcome difficulties and reclaimed 6.5 million mu of wasteland, turning the wilderness of thousands of years into the new granary of the motherland. Calculated at a yield of 200 jin per mu, these fields increase the country's grain production by 1.3 billion jin a year. More than 90,000 immigrants from Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces who have moved to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have also become more than 70% to 80% self-sufficient with production income, living a life of abundance. This year, the immigrants who moved from Shaanxi Province to Zhongwei County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, harvested 1.23 million jin of grain in the first year, not only becoming self-sufficient, but also selling 350,000 jin of surplus grain. They happily sang: "Hard work to build homes, overcome difficulties to strive for the first, realize the abundance of grains, happy life is boundless."

Immigrants not only undertake the glorious cause of reclaiming wasteland, but also carry out geological exploration activities, run industries, build water conservancy projects, and engage in cultural, educational and medical work. More than 100,000 Han workers who moved from Anshan, Shanghai, Shenyang, Beijing and other places to Baotou, Inner Mongolia, not only helped the Mongolian people build an iron and steel industrial base on the grassland, but also cultivated a contingent of minority workers, who are respectfully called the "mother machine" of Inner Mongolia's technical force. Several thousand construction workers from Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong moved to Qinghai and built more than 400,000 square meters of houses with local workers, making new towns and villages constantly appear on the vast wilderness.

In the frontier and minority areas, immigrants receive the kind care and help of party and government leading organs and the broad masses of local people. The vast majority of the more than 60,000 immigrants to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are settled in well-equipped mechanized farms. This year, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has built more than 30,000 new houses for immigrants and properly arranged their production. Farmers in Linhe County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, donated a batch of food rations, iron shovels and various agricultural tools to the newly arrived people from Hebei to help the immigrants settle down and start their businesses. In order to thank the local cadres and the masses for their selfless help, the immigrants launched an immigration friendship competition in the whole banner, proposing: oppose dependence, oppose special treatment, oppose being guests; compare loving the society as home, compare self-reliance, compare building a home and starting a business, compare unity and mutual assistance, compare mutual learning of production technology, compare abiding by the society charter and labor discipline.

At present, the frontier provinces and regions are actively carrying out preparatory work to welcome immigrants who will go to support construction this winter and next spring. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has established reception stations to solve food and lodging along the way from the Xiadong Station in Gansu to various stations within the autonomous region, and is equipped with leather coats and felt boots to keep out the cold. Housing has been prepared in all farms where immigrants are going.

The Northwest, Northeast and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have vast land and abundant resources above and below ground, but the population is sparse and the technical foundation is relatively poor. Therefore, they urgently need the labor and technical support from the interior to accelerate the socialist construction there.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Many young workers, farmers, scientific and technical personnel, cadres and students in various places have asked to go to the frontier to build the frontier of the motherland into a beautiful garden. These requests will be approved by the local party committees and governments, and they will be organized to go to the frontier in a planned and led manner.

After Vice Chairman Zhu De made a call for young people to go to the frontier at the conference of young socialist construction activists of the central state organs in October this year, the China Youth Daily received a large number of letters from all over the country. Young people in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Guangdong, Hubei and other places have expressed their determination in their letters: to go to the great northwest and Inner Mongolia of the motherland, together with all fraternal nationalities, to quickly develop the treasures of the motherland.

Many young students wrote applications to the school, saying that building the frontier of the motherland is their greatest happiness, and they want to wholeheartedly devote themselves to this magnificent cause, so that flowers will bloom all over the frontier. Some newlyweds also wrote to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, resolutely requesting to settle down in the frontier and strive for the construction of the frontier for life.

The youth of Henan Province put forward the heroic slogan of "We have people and we have everything we need," and enthusiastically signed up to build the frontier. Xinqiao Township, Xiayi County, originally planned to send 250 young people to the frontier, but 4,800 people signed up at once, half men and half women.

    到祖国最需要的地方去！
    百万移民在边疆安家立业
    内地青年纷纷表示愿献身于建设边疆壮丽事业
    新华社1日讯  “到祖国最需要的地方去”已经成为广大人民的共同心愿和行动。自1955年以来，全国有一百三十八万人民从内地迁移到西北、东北及内蒙古自治区，开发和建设边疆。他们以无比的英雄气概，战胜艰难困苦，垦荒六百五十万亩，使千百年来的荒野变成了祖国的新谷仓。这些田地按亩产二百斤计算，一年就为国家增产十三亿斤粮食。由河北、山西等省迁居内蒙古自治区的九万多移民，也已有70％到80％靠生产收入自给有余，过着丰衣足食的生活。今年从陕西省迁入宁夏回族自治区中卫县的移民们，第一年便收获粮食一百二十三万斤，不仅自给自足，还出售了三十五万斤余粮。他们欢乐地歌唱：“辛勤劳动建家园，克服困难要争先，五谷丰登自实现，幸福生活乐无边。”
    移民们不仅承担了开垦荒地的光荣事业，并且进行地质勘探活动，办工业，修水利和从事文教医疗工作。十多万从鞍山、上海、沈阳、北京等地迁移到内蒙古包头的汉族职工，不仅帮助蒙古族人民在草原上建起了钢铁工业基地，还培养出一支少数民族的工人队伍，被人们尊敬地称为内蒙古技术力量的“母机”。几千名江苏、河北、山东的建筑工人移入青海后，和当地工人一起建造了四十多万平方公尺面积的房屋，使大荒原上不断出现新的城镇和村庄。
    移民们在边疆和少数民族地区，得到党政领导机关与当地广大群众的亲切关怀和帮助。到新疆维吾尔自治区去的六万多移民，绝大部分被安置在设备完善的机耕农场。宁夏回族自治区今年专门为移民盖了三万多间新房屋，并妥善安排他们的生产。内蒙古自治区临河县的农民，把自己的一批口粮、铁锹及各种农具，赠送给新来的河北人民，帮助移民安家立业。移民们为了答谢当地干部、群众的无私帮助，在全旗开展了移民友谊竞赛，提出：反对依赖，反对特殊，反对作客；比爱社如家，比自力更生，比建家立业，比团结互助，比互相学习生产技术，比遵守社章和劳动纪律。
    目前，各边疆省区正积极进行准备工作，欢迎今冬明春前去支援建设的移民。新疆维吾尔自治区从甘肃的峡东车站到自治区境内各车站，都建立了解决沿途食宿的接待站，并备有御寒的皮大衣和毡靴。凡是有移民前往的农场，都已准备了住屋。
    西北、东北地区和内蒙古自治区土地辽阔，地上、地下的资源非常丰富，但人口稀少，技术基础也比较差，因此迫切需要内地在劳力上和技术上的支援，加速那里的社会主义建设。
    新华社1日讯  各地许多青年工人、农民、科学技术人员、干部和学生，纷纷要求到边疆去，把祖国边疆建设成美丽的花园。这些要求将经过各地党委、政府的批准后，并且有领导、有计划地组织他们到边疆去。
    朱德副主席今年10月在中央国家机关青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上提出青年们到边疆去的号召后，中国青年报收到了大批来自祖国各地的信件。河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、辽宁、广东、湖北等地的青年，都在信中热情地表示了自己的决心：要到祖国的大西北和内蒙古去，同各兄弟民族一起，迅速开发祖国的宝藏。
    许多青年学生向学校写了申请书，表示建设祖国边疆是他们最大的幸福，他们要全心全意地献身于这个壮丽的事业，让边疆开遍鲜花。有的新婚夫妇，还写信给共青团中央，坚决要求到边疆去安家落户，终身为建设边疆而奋斗。
    河南省的青年提出了“要人有人，要啥有啥”的豪迈口号，踊跃报名去建设边疆。夏邑县新桥乡原来准备送二百五十名青年到边疆去，可是一次就有四千八百人报名，男女各占一半。
