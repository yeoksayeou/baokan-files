    Promoting Western Medicine Practitioners to Learn from Traditional Chinese Medicine and Sino-Western Medicine Cooperation
    Xi'an Establishes Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an) The Xi'an Seventh Hospital and the Xi'an Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital have merged to form a new type of hospital integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicine. This hospital officially began its outpatient service on November 24th.
    The hospital is currently still named the Xi'an Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. The entire hospital has forty-three traditional Chinese medicine doctors and twenty-seven Western medicine doctors. Nearly half of the nursing staff have basically mastered the nursing knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine. Currently, each department of this hospital, whether outpatient or inpatient, is equipped with both traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors and traditional Chinese and Western medicine beds. Patients can freely choose to see either traditional Chinese or Western medicine doctors.
    The benefits of this integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine hospital are: not only can traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners cooperate at any time, jointly diagnose and research various diseases, which is beneficial to the treatment of patients, but more importantly, it greatly facilitates Western medicine practitioners to learn traditional Chinese medicine. It is a good organizational form for promoting the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. After the hospital merger, the enthusiasm of medical staff for learning the motherland's medicine has become even higher. Internal medicine doctors from the former Seventh Hospital have begun to use traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture to treat more than ten diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis, dysentery, nephritis, and hypertension. Surgical medical staff have begun activities to learn acupuncture and use traditional Chinese medicine to treat diseases. (Attached picture)

    促进西医学习中医和中西医合作
    西安成立中西医合璧医院
    本报西安电  西安市第七医院和西安市中医医院合并，成立一所新型的中西医合璧医院。这所医院已在11月24日正式开始门诊。
    这所医院现仍命名为西安市中医医院。全院有四十三个中医师和二十七个西医师。已有将近一半的护理人员基本上掌握了中医的护理知识。现在，这所医院的各个科室，不论门诊、病房，都配备有中西医师和中西医病床。病人可以自由选中医或西医看病。
    这所中西合璧医院的好处是：不仅中西医可以随时合作，共同诊断和研究各种疾病，有利于对病人的治疗，更重要的是大大有利于促进西医学习中医。它是促进中西医合流的一个良好的组织形式。医院合并以后，医护人员学习祖国医学的热情更加高涨。原第七医院内科医师，已开始用中药和针灸治疗肺结核、痢疾、肾脏炎、高血压等十多种疾病，外科医护人员已开始了学针灸、学用中药治病的活动。（附图片）
