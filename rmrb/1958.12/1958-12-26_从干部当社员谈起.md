    Starting from Cadres Becoming Commune Members
    Yiqing
    The practice of cadres of the Gan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province taking turns going down to the people's communes to be "Five-Good" commune members is a practical and effective way to delve into the masses and improve leadership style.

    This method is practical and effective primarily because it can fundamentally eliminate the distance between cadres and the masses, and further strengthen the connection between them. When people establish feelings in the process of eating, living, and laboring together, the masses regard cadres as ordinary laborers, close partners. At this time, they will confide in the cadres.

    This method is practical and effective also because cadres can use their practical actions to drive the masses forward. The masses pay very close attention to the words and deeds of the cadres. The exemplary actions of cadres constantly play an educational role for the masses. Using actions to educate the masses is often more effective than verbal propaganda. Liu Pinjing's spirit of consciously laboring in the commune moved many commune members, so he was confident in motivating the commune members in his team to strive to change into a "Five-Good" commune member-oriented team. This approach is effective also because it allows cadres to put themselves in the position of an ordinary commune member to look at problems; it enables cadres to hear, see, and feel some situations and problems that they could not understand when sitting in the office or going to the commune to understand the work. They labor like the commune members, rest like them, eat like them, and attend meetings like them. The voices and demands of the commune members in their labor and life are often their own voices and demands. For example, when they walk into the cafeteria and feel uncomfortable eating cold food; when they feel excessively tired from labor, they will immediately think about how to ensure that everyone eats enough and eats well, and how to better arrange the commune's production and life. And they will feel the urgency and importance of solving these problems. Liu Pinjing, Deputy Secretary of the Gan County Committee, is a good cadre from a peasant background who often went to the grassroots to understand the situation in the past, but because he has been a cadre for many years, he felt that some of the problems among the masses were no longer so intimate. When he became a commune member, he truly felt that many problems in the commune, from production and development of the Party organization to small matters such as commune members bringing bowls and chopsticks when eating, were meticulous, accurate, and quickly resolved.

    Some people say: Doesn't the fact that cadres become commune members weaken the leadership of overall work? The answer is: As long as it is handled well, there will not only be no contradiction between being a commune member and overall leadership, but they will complement each other. After they clearly understand the situation and problems of a production team or a production group, they can more intimately guide and solve the work problems of a commune or a county. The general must be combined with the individual; dissecting a sparrow can reveal the general physiological condition of sparrows. Delving into a commune can reveal the general situation of the commune. As long as attention is paid to the particularities of other communes, the experience of one commune can be promoted in many communes to a large extent. Liu Pinjing used the problems he felt and the solutions he found in the process of being a commune member to promote throughout the county and solve the work problems of the whole county.

    从干部当社员谈起
    怡清
    中共江西省赣县县委干部轮流下放到人民公社当“五好”社员的做法，是深入群众，改进领导作风的一个切实、有效的办法。
    这个办法所以切实有效，首先在于它能从根本上消除干部和群众之间的距离，进一步密切干部和群众的联系。当人们在同吃、同住、同劳动中建立了感情的时候，群众把干部当作一个普通劳动者，一个亲密的伙伴。这个时候，他们就会掏出心里话来同干部说。
    这个办法所以切实有效，还在于干部可以用自己的实际行动带动群众前进。干部的一举一动，群众是非常注意的。干部的模范行动，时时刻刻对群众起教育作用。用行动来教育群众，往往比口头宣传有更好的成效。刘品经在公社中自觉劳动的精神，就感动了许多社员，因此，他也就有信心把自己所在队的社员带动起来，争取改变成为“五好”社员化的小队。这种作法之所以有效，还在于它能使干部设身处地，把自己放在一个普通公社社员的地位来看问题；使干部听到、看到和感觉到一些过去坐在机关里或到社里了解工作情况时所无法了解到的情况和问题。他们和社员们一样劳动，一样休息，一样吃饭，一样开会。社员劳动生活中的呼声、要求，常常就是他们自己的呼声和要求。比如：当他们一走进食堂，吃着冷冰冰的饭菜觉得很不舒服的时候；当他们劳动感到过度疲劳的时候，他们就会马上想到如何保证大家吃得饱又吃得好，如何更好地安排公社的生产和生活。并且会感到解决这些问题的迫切性和重要性。赣县县委副书记刘品经，是个农民出身的好干部，过去经常深入基层，了解情况，但是由于他当了多年干部，群众中的某些问题，他感觉得已经不那么亲切了。当他成了社员的时候，他对于公社的许多问题，大至生产、发展党的组织，小至社员吃饭带碗筷等问题，真是一件件，一桩桩，无微不至，看得既准，解决得又快。
    有人说：干部当了社员，不是削弱了对全面工作的领导了吗？答复是：只要处理得好，当社员和全面领导之间不仅不会发生矛盾，而且是相辅相成的。当他们清楚地了解到一个生产队、一个生产小组的情况和问题以后，就能更亲切地来指导和解决一个公社、一个县的工作问题。一般必需与个别相结合，解剖一个麻雀，就能知道麻雀的一般生理情况。深入一个公社，就能知道公社的一般情况。只要注意了其他公社的特殊性，在很大的程度上，一个公社的经验在许多公社都是可以推广的。刘品经就是把他在当社员过程中，感受到的问题和解决问题的办法，用来向全县推广，解决全县工作问题的。
