    Aviation Sports Open to Workers and Peasants
    The China National Defense Sports Association convened a national on-site aviation sports conference in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, in late November. More than 120 representatives from various provincial (municipal) national defense sports associations, aviation clubs, and units directly under the China National Defense Sports Association, such as the China National Aviation Club, gliding schools, and aviation cadre training classes, attended the meeting. In addition, more than 40 aviation sports activists from Hengyang City attended the meeting as observers. At the conclusion of the meeting, General Li Da, Director of the China National Defense Sports Association, delivered a speech.
    The meeting pointed out: In order to meet the needs of the leap forward in socialist construction and industrial and agricultural production, and to develop aviation sports, it is necessary to promote the spirit of hard struggle, building the country diligently and thriftily, and running undertakings diligently and thriftily, to liberate thinking, rely on the masses, break with conventions, and adopt methods of substituting indigenous methods for foreign ones, making do with whatever is available, and starting from scratch. The Hengyang Club has been successful in this regard. They have achieved remarkable results with few personnel, lack of equipment, and insufficient experience. Without ground practice frames, they made wooden hanging frames; without winch vehicles, they used automobile traction and installed safety equipment; without cable retrieval machines, they used manpower to pull steel cables. The representatives at the meeting unanimously agreed that the experience of the Hengyang Club is worth learning and promoting. Many units originally believed that conditions were not sufficient and did not dare to establish clubs or established few clubs. After visiting the Hengyang Club on site, they quickly revised their plans. In accordance with the spirit of sports serving production and sports serving national defense, the meeting determined that the future development direction of aviation sports must be to open aviation sports to workers and peasants, with popularization and improvement proceeding simultaneously, but with popularization as the main focus. Through a combination of large, medium, and small-scale efforts and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, aviation sports, especially gliding, should be rapidly popularized everywhere. Secondly, multifaceted sports activities should be carried out in aviation sports. The meeting also called on all regions to actively produce ground ejection and primary gliders to meet the needs of widely开展gliding运动.

    航空运动向工农开门
    中国人民国防体育协会11月下旬在湖南衡阳市召开了全国航空体育现场会议。出席这次会议的有各省（市）国防体育协会、航空俱乐部和中国人民国防体育协会直属的中国人民航空俱乐部、滑翔学校、航空干部训练班等单位的代表一百二十多人。另外衡阳市四十多名航空运动积极分子列席参加会议。在会议结束时，中国人民国防体育协会主任李达上将讲了话。
    会议指出：为了适应社会主义建设和工农业生产大跃进的形势的需要，发展航空体育事业，必须发扬艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，勤俭办事业的精神，解放思想，依靠群众，打破常规，采取以土代洋，因陋就简，白手起家的办法。衡阳俱乐部在这一点上，是作得成功的。他们在人员少、器材缺乏和经验不足的情况下，取得了显著的成绩。没有地面练习架，他们就制木吊架；没有绞盘车用汽车牵引，装上安全设备；没有收索机就用人拉钢索。到会代表一致认为衡阳俱乐部的经验，是值得学习推广的。原来很多单位认为条件不够，不敢建立俱乐部或少建俱乐部，通过衡阳俱乐部的现场参观，都很快修改了计划。会议根据体育为生产、体育为国防的精神，确定今后航空运动的发展方向，必须使航空运动向工农开门，普及与提高同时并举，而以普及为主，通过大中小型相结合和土洋并举，迅速使航空运动特别是滑翔运动遍地开花；其次，在航空运动中开展多面手运动。会议还要求各地积极生产地面弹射和初级滑翔机，以满足广泛开展滑翔运动的需要。
