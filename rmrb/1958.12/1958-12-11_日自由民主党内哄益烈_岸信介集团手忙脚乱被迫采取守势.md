Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch: On the eve of the convocation of the regular session of the Japanese Diet (December 10th), the struggle of the "anti-mainstream faction" within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party against Nobusuke Kishi is becoming increasingly acute. The "mainstream faction" headed by Nobusuke Kishi has been thrown into disarray in this struggle for power and profit, and is forced to adopt a defensive posture.

The "anti-mainstream faction" is using the fact that Nobusuke Kishi illegally extended the session of the extraordinary Diet session and forcibly passed the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" causing chaos during the Diet session as an important weapon to attack the Kishi Nobusuke group. At the same time, taking advantage of the Japanese people's firm opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," it launched a full-scale offensive against the Kishi Nobusuke group from within the party. According to Kyodo News, the intention of the "anti-mainstream faction" "is to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet all at once before the expiration of Liberal Democratic Party President Nobusuke Kishi's term of office in March next year." This news agency said: "Therefore, the situation has become serious."

The Ikeda (Hayato) faction, Ishibashi (Tanzan) faction, Ishii (Mitsujiro) faction, and Matsumura (Kenzo)-Miki (Takeo) faction, among the "anti-mainstream faction," sent eight representatives, including Seiko Koichi and Ohashi Takeo, to see Nobusuke Kishi today, demanding "a reshuffle of party personnel to meet the expectations of the people." They believe that the abnormal state of the Diet is the responsibility of the Liberal Democratic Party's executive body, and therefore demanded the replacement of the Liberal Democratic Party's five leaders.

The "anti-mainstream faction" also expressed dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's method of sacrificing the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives to clean up the mess he had created. It has been rumored that Nobusuke Kishi is attempting to bring in former Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic Party advisor Ashida Hitoshi to serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the "anti-mainstream faction" also sent representatives to visit Ashida Hitoshi today, asking him to reject the "mainstream faction's" request.

Nobusuke Kishi and other "mainstream faction" leaders also met repeatedly today, deciding that when Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima comes forward to answer the questions raised by the "anti-mainstream faction," he should "not make any counter-attack statements" and "not adopt stimulating methods that simply use pressure" in order to "ease the offensive of the anti-mainstream faction." According to Kyodo News, Nobusuke Kishi and others have "no other way but to consolidate the unity of the mainstream faction to cope with the offensive of the anti-mainstream faction."

The factional struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party has seriously affected the Kishi Nobusuke government's plan to negotiate with the United States to revise the "Security Treaty." Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama told reporters today that if the factional struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party continues until next year, the original plan to submit a proposal on revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" as early as possible at the regular session of the Diet would have to be changed. However, Fujiyama stated that he did not intend to abandon negotiations on revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" "under any circumstances."

### 日自由民主党内哄益烈  岸信介集团手忙脚乱被迫采取守势

    日自由民主党内哄益烈
    岸信介集团手忙脚乱被迫采取守势
    新华社9日讯  东京消息：在日本国会平时会议（10日）召开的前夕，日本执政的自由民主党内部“反主流派”反对岸信介的斗争日趋尖锐化。以岸信介为首的“主流派”在这场争权夺利的斗争中已经弄得手忙脚乱，被迫采取守势。
    “反主流派”利用岸信介非法延长国会临时会议会期强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”以致造成国会长时期的混乱这件事作为它攻击岸信介集团的重要武器。同时，它趁日本人民坚决反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的时机，从党内发动对岸信介集团的全面进攻。据共同社说，“反主流派”的意图，“是想在明年3月自由民主党总裁岸信介任期届满以前的这个时候，一下子打倒岸信介内阁。”这家通讯社说：“因此，情况已经变得严重起来。”
    “反主流派”中的池田（勇人）派、石桥（湛山）派、石井（光次郎）派和松村（谦三）—三木（武夫）派等四派今天派了世耕弘一、大桥武夫等八名代表去见岸信介，要求“刷新党内人事，以付国民的期望”。他们认为，国会出现不正常的状态，自由民主党的执行机构应该负责，因此要求撤换自由民主党的五位领导人。
    “反主流派”对岸信介用牺牲众议院正副议长的办法来收拾自己所一手造成的混乱局面的做法也表示不满。目前已经传出消息，岸信介企图拉前首相、自由民主党顾问芦田均出来担任众议院议长。因此，“反主流派”今天还派代表访问芦田均，要他拒绝“主流派”的要求。
    岸信介等“主流派”首脑今天也一再开会，决定在干事长川岛正次郎出面答复“反主流派”所提出的问题时，“不作反击性质的发言”，并且“不采取一味使用压力的刺激性办法”，以便“缓和反主流派的攻势”。据共同社说，岸信介等除了“巩固主流派的团结以应付反主流派的攻势以外，再也没有别的办法”。
    自由民主党内部的派系斗争使岸信介政府同美国谈判修改“安全条约”的计划受到严重影响。外务相藤山爱一郎今天向记者发表谈话说，要是自由民主党内部的派系斗争一直继续到明年的话，原定的在国会平时会议上尽早提出关于修改日美“安全条约”提案的计划就不得不改变。但是，藤山表示，“在任何情况下”都不打算放弃修改日美“安全条约”的谈判。
