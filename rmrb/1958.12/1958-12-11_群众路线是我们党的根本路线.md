Editorial of the "Frontline Bi-weekly"

    In recent months, people's communes, like in most rural areas across the country, have been universally organized in the suburbs of Beijing. During the movement of communization, the consciousness and productive enthusiasm of the broad masses have been significantly enhanced. After the establishment of the communes, the degree of collectivization of the masses in production labor and life has further developed than before. At this time, every move of the commune's leadership and cadres will directly or indirectly affect the immediate interests of each commune member, as well as the overall interests of each people's commune. At this time, we believe it is necessary to once again emphasize the issue of the mass line, drawing the close attention of cadres and staff at all levels.

    The great victory of the Great Leap Forward is a great achievement of the Party's mass line. The rich experience of the Party's mass line should be studied, summarized, promoted, and improved.

    As everyone knows, the mass line is the fundamental political and organizational line of our Party. The Party's political line is based on the demands of the greatest number of people and conforms to the highest interests of the greatest number of people; the Party's organizational line is to ensure that the Party's organizations and members can closely connect with the masses and serve the realization of the Party's political line. No matter when, no matter what task we want to accomplish, we must adhere to this fundamental line. This was the case during the past period of the people's democratic revolution, and it is also the case during the current period of socialist revolution and construction. Taking this year as an example, the reason why we have been able to achieve great victories on all fronts is because we have implemented the Party's mass line, mobilized the masses, and relied on the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels, putting politics in command, and based on the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, a vigorous mass movement to accelerate the construction of socialism has been launched. Wherever the Party points, the masses rush to, one upsurge after another, one victory after another. This is undoubtedly a great achievement of our Party's mass line in the new era. We should fully affirm that this broad mass movement for continuously leaping forward to accelerate the construction of socialism is not only the actual result of the Party's mass line but also the concentrated embodiment of the Party's mass line. We have accumulated extremely rich experience in implementing the Party's mass line in the past, and there are also many new important experiences in recent years, which should be carefully studied and summarized, and further promoted and improved.

    What are the new and important experiences we have gained in implementing the Party's mass line? Generally speaking, after the rectification movement, the connection between most of our cadres and the masses has been universally strengthened, creating a new working method for the mass line. This is the method of promoting cadres to cultivate experimental plots, using the practical actions of cadres to influence the masses and give play to the exemplary role of cadres; this is to organize the people's leap forward, allowing our cadres to go deep into the masses to lead the Great Leap Forward, appearing as ordinary laborers, eating, living, and working with the masses, everyone working together; this is to use the method of mass movement to carry out various construction undertakings, break superstitions, liberate the mind, and rely on the wisdom of the masses to develop the people's economy and scientific and cultural undertakings at high speed in every possible way. This has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses for continuous revolution, and they have thrown themselves into the vigorous Great Leap Forward movement to realize the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. These successful experiences in the mass line during this period should be well adhered to, striving to make greater achievements on all fronts next year.

    The great victory of the Great Leap Forward has also made some cadres dizzy, and the ideological style of violating the mass line has slowly risen again. This ideological style is essentially the inevitable product of a subjective ideological method.

    However, we should also see that, due to the tremendous victories that have been achieved on all fronts, and the generally smooth progress of the people's commune movement, the broad masses have expressed great trust and enthusiastic support for the Party. As a result, some cadres have become dizzy, thinking that whatever they think of can be done, and the ideological style of violating the mass line has slowly risen again. Some cadres even refuse to implement the mass line for various reasons, do not consult with the masses when problems arise, and often act with simple orders and other rude methods. This is a dangerous tendency that we must try to prevent at present.

    The harmfulness of the ideological style of violating the mass line is very obvious. It will make us divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, it will cause serious damage to the interests of the people, and it will cause setbacks and failures of varying degrees to the cause of revolution and construction. This ideological style is extremely wrong. It is essentially the inevitable product of a subjective ideological method. The subjective ideological method seriously hinders people's correct understanding of objective things. Some of our cadres, thinking that they have already understood many practical situations, no longer pay attention to conducting systematic investigations and research at any time and place, and are unwilling to patiently consult with the masses on various issues, but make judgments and issue orders based on their own whims. In fact, many of the problems we face are new problems that we have not encountered in the past, many complex and changing new situations require us to understand, and new laws of objective movement still need to be discovered and mastered by us. Therefore, we have no reason not to conduct investigations and research work realistically, and we have no reason not to consult with the masses with an open mind when problems arise. Our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly taught us to conduct systematic investigation and research work, to adhere to the mass line, and have set many examples worthy of our learning. If our cadres at all levels can adhere to the mass line and systematically conduct investigation and research, then our subjective understanding, that is, our thoughts, theories, resolutions, plans, and programs, can roughly conform to reality or approach reality, thereby greatly reducing subjective errors.

    To implement the mass line, we must widely and comprehensively concentrate the opinions of the masses, and especially oppose the bad practice of some comrades who only collect materials that are beneficial to their subjective conclusions, obliterate all materials that are unfavorable to their conclusions, and even fabricate situations.

    To follow the mass line and conduct investigation and research must be serious and thorough, not formalistic. When making a final decision on each major issue, we must widely and comprehensively concentrate the opinions of the masses, pay special attention to listening to and considering different opinions, and be good at inspiring and guiding the masses to express various different opinions. Only after a great airing of views, a great debate, and repeated comparison and research of various different opinions can we make a sound and comprehensive judgment and conclusion on a major issue. We must try our best to avoid one-sidedness in considering and handling problems. We must especially oppose the bad practice of some comrades who only collect materials that are beneficial to their subjective conclusions, obliterate all materials that are unfavorable to their conclusions, and even fabricate situations. We are Marxist-Leninists, dialectical materialists, and we must advocate a honest, modest and prudent attitude, and advocate a realistic work style that is completely responsible to the Party and the people.

    Our mass line serves a subject, which is the masses. We must lead the masses, but we cannot monopolize and replace the masses in their own affairs. Even resolutions made through the mass line still need to go through the mass line when they are implemented. For example, the distribution problem of the people's commune is entirely a matter within the laboring people, and it must be seriously discussed and decided with the masses. Some commune cadres still do not understand this point. They think that many principled issues have already been discussed with the masses, and the consent of the masses has been obtained, then just do it, who has any reason to object? The fact is not as simple as these comrades imagine. Our resolutions, even if they are based on sufficient investigation and research, based on the results of mass discussion, even if they conform to objective reality or roughly conform to reality, cannot be implemented simply by administrative orders and a call. To implement a resolution that has been unanimously adopted by the masses, we should still patiently conduct propaganda and explanation among the masses, and repeatedly discuss with the masses the specific steps and methods of implementation, so that this resolution can truly become the conscious action of the broad masses.

    The Party's mass line is not like what the tailism advocates, doing whatever the masses say, but doing whatever should be done in accordance with objective possibilities and needs.

    Undoubtedly, the mass line of our Party is not like what the tailists advocate, "doing whatever the masses say," nor does it mean that the leadership can lag behind the mass movement. Our slogan is: "Act according to objective possibilities and needs," "Do whatever should be done." The so-called objective possibilities can have two explanations: one is real possibility, which is realized after the necessary conditions are met and people's subjective efforts are made; the other is abstract possibility, which is a fantasy that does not start from objective conditions at all. We Marxists must never regard fantasy as possibility. We must act in accordance with objective laws realistically, that is, "do whatever should be done," and stand at the forefront of the mass movement to lead the masses, instead of following the tide and being the tail of the masses. This is a problem that we must pay attention to when implementing the Party's mass line.

    Practical experience tells us that the Party's mass line and class line are unified and inseparable. What we are implementing is the class mass line, not talking about an abstract mass line apart from the class line. The Party Central Committee wrote in the resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas promulgated in August this year: "Merging small co-ops into large ones and transforming them into people's communes is the common demand of the broad masses at present. Poor and lower-middle peasants are firmly supporting it, and most of the upper-middle peasants are also in favor of it. We must rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, fully mobilize the masses, launch airing views and debates, unite the majority of upper-middle peasants who agree to merge into large co-ops and transform into communes, overcome the wavering of another part of the upper-middle peasants, expose and defeat the rumors and sabotage of landlords and rich peasants, so that the broad masses of peasants can merge into large co-ops and transform into communes on the basis of ideological liberation, conscious willingness, and prevent coercion and command." This resolution has stipulated the fundamental principles of our Party's class line, which is also the mass line, in the people's commune movement. We should continue to follow this regulation in future work and correctly unify the mass line and the class line.

    In order to adhere to and implement the mass line, it is currently necessary to improve democratic centralism in the people's communes and pay more attention to the lives of the masses. The democratic steps taken by the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing recently in discussing distribution issues, improving management and administration, and consolidating and developing the communes have further encouraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of members to participate in production labor. We must now further universally implement the spirit of democratic centralism in the commune's economic activities, political activities, and military activities of the militia organizations.

### 群众路线是我们党的根本路线

    群众路线是我们党的根本路线
    前线半月刊社论
    最近几个月，人民公社在北京郊区，同在全国大多数农村中一样，已经普遍地组织起来。在公社化的运动中，广大群众的觉悟程度和生产积极性有了显著的提高。公社成立以后，群众在生产劳动和生活上的集体化程度，都比以前更进一步发展了。这个时候，公社的领导机构和干部的一举一动，更将直接或间接地影响到每个公社社员的切身利益，也影响到各个人民公社的整体利益。这个时候，我们认为有必要再一次特别强调地提出群众路线的问题，引起各级干部和工作人员的密切注意。
    大跃进的伟大胜利，是党的群众路线的伟大收获。党的群众路线的丰富经验，应该加以研究和总结，推广和提高
    大家都知道，群众路线是我们党的根本的政治路线和组织路线。党的政治路线是根据最大多数人民群众的要求，符合于最大多数人民群众的最高利益的；党的组织路线就要保证党的组织和成员能够密切联系群众，为实现党的政治路线而服务。无论在什么时候，无论要完成什么任务，我们都必须坚持执行这个根本路线。在过去人民民主革命时期是这样，在现在社会主义革命和建设时期也是这样。就以今年这一年的情况来说，我们所以能够在各个战线上取得伟大的胜利，就是因为我们贯彻执行了党的群众路线，发动群众，依靠群众的缘故。大跃进以来，由于各级党委加强领导，政治挂帅，在整风和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，开展了轰轰烈烈的加速建设社会主义的广大群众运动。党指向哪里，群众就奔向哪里，一个高潮接一个高潮，一个胜利接一个胜利。这无疑地是我们党的群众路线在新时期的伟大收获。我们完全应该肯定，为加速建设社会主义而不断跃进的这一广大群众运动本身，不但是党的群众路线的实际成果，而且也是党的群众路线的集中体现，我们在执行党的群众路线方面，过去已经积累了极其丰富的经验，而在近年来又有许多新的重要经验，应该细密地加以研究和总结，进一步加以推广和提高。
    我们在贯彻执行党的群众路线方面，有哪些新的重要的经验呢？总的说来，经过整风运动以后，我们的大多数干部和群众的联系有了普遍的增强，创造了群众路线的新工作方式。这就是推行干部种试验田的方法，以干部的实际行动去影响群众，发挥干部带头的模范作用；这就是组织全民的跃进，让我们的干部深入到群众中去领导大跃进，以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，大家打成一片；这就是用群众运动的方式来举办各种建设事业，破除迷信，解放思想，依靠群众的智慧，千方百计地高速度地发展人民的经济和科学文化事业。这样就极大地鼓舞了广大群众不断革命的热情，为实现鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，而投入轰轰烈烈的大跃进运动中去。这个时期在群众路线方面的这些成功的经验，应该好好地坚持下去，争取明年在各个战线上做出更大的成绩。
    大跃进的伟大胜利，也冲昏了一部分干部的头脑，违反群众路线的思想作风又慢慢抬头了，这种思想作风在本质上是主观主义的思想方法的必然产物
    但是，我们也应该看到，由于各个战线上已经取得了巨大的胜利，人民公社化运动的进展一般都很顺利，广大群众对党表示极大的信任和热烈拥护，因此，有一部分干部又冲昏了头脑，以为自己想到哪里就一定都能够做到哪里，违反群众路线的思想作风又慢慢抬头了。有的干部甚至以种种理由为借口，拒绝实行群众路线，遇事不同群众商量，往往用简单命令以及其他粗暴的方式行事。这是我们目前必须设法防止的危险倾向。
    违反群众路线的思想作风的危害性是非常明显的。它会使我们脱离实际、脱离群众，会使人民群众的利益受到严重的损害，会使革命和建设的事业遭到挫折和不同程度的失败。这种思想作风是极端错误的。它在本质上是主观主义的思想方法的必然产物。主观主义的思想方法严重地障碍了人们对客观事物的正确认识。我们有的干部，自以为已经懂得了许多实际情况，就不再注意随时随地进行系统的调查研究，不肯耐心地同各方面的群众反复商量问题，就凭自己的脑子一热，灵机一动，就做出判断，乱下命令。其实，我们所面临的问题有许多是过去没有遇到的新问题，许多复杂变化的新情况需要我们去了解，客观运动的新规律还需要我们去发现和掌握。因此，我们没有理由能够不实事求是地进行调查研究工作，没有理由能够遇事不虚心地同群众商量。我们的党中央和毛泽东同志一再教导我们，要进行系统的调查研究工作，要坚持走群众路线，并且给我们做出了许多值得我们学习的榜样。如果我们的各级干部，都能坚持执行群众路线，系统地进行调查研究，那就一定可以使我们的主观认识，即我们的思想、理论、决议、计划和方案，大体符合实际或者接近实际，从而大大减少主观主义的错误。
    要贯彻群众路线，必须广泛地全面地集中群众的意见，特别要反对有些同志只收集对他的主观结论有利的材料，抹杀一切对他的结论不利的材料，甚至不惜假报情况的那种恶劣作风
    走群众路线和进行调查研究必须认真彻底，而不是形式主义。对于每一个重大问题要做出最后决定的时候，必须广泛地全面地集中群众的意见，特别要注意听取和考虑不同的意见，并且要善于启发和引导群众把各种不同的意见发表出来。只有经过大鸣大放大辩论，反复地比较研究各种不同的意见之后，我们对于一个重大的问题才能做出完善的全面的判断和结论。我们要极力避免在考虑问题和处理问题中的片面性。我们特别要反对有些同志只收集对他的主观结论有利的材料，抹杀一切对他的结论不利的材料，甚至不惜假报情况的那种恶劣作风。我们是马克思列宁主义者，是辩证唯物主义者，我们要提倡老老实实的谦虚谨慎的态度，提倡对党对人民完全负责到底的实事求是的作风。
    我们的群众路线服务于一个主体，这就是群众。我们要领导群众，而不能包办代替群众自己的事情。即便是通过群众路线做出的决议，在交付实施的时候，仍然要经过群众路线。比如人民公社的分配问题等完全是属于劳动人民内部的问题，必须认真地同群众商量决定。现在有些公社的干部对于这一点还不够了解。他们以为有许多原则问题已经同群众讨论过了，已经取得了群众的同意，那末，就只管干吧，谁还有理由反对呢？事实并不是像这些同志所设想的那样简单。我们的决议，即便是根据充分的调查研究，根据群众讨论的结果，即便是符合于客观实际或者大体符合于实际的，也还不能只靠简单的行政命令和一个号召就实行起来。我们要实施一项已经由群众一致通过的决议，仍然应该在群众中耐心地进行宣传解释，反复地同群众商量实行的具体步骤和方法，才能使这一项决议真正变成广大群众自觉的行动。
    党的群众路线并不像尾巴主义者所主张的群众说怎么办就怎么办、而是按照客观的可能与需要办事该怎么办就怎么办
    毫无疑问，我们党的群众路线，并不是像尾巴主义者所主张的“群众说怎么办就怎么办”，也不是说领导可以落在群众运动的后面。我们的口号是：“按照客观的可能和需要办事”，“该怎么办就怎么办”。所谓客观的可能性可以有两种解释：一种是实在的可能性，这是具备了必要条件，经过人们的主观努力就能够实现的；另一种是抽象的可能性，那是根本不从客观条件出发的空想。我们马克思主义者决不应该把空想当做可能性。我们要实事求是地按照客观规律办事，就是“该怎么办就怎么办”，要站在群众运动的最前面去领导群众，而不应该随波逐流地做群众的尾巴。这是我们在贯彻执行党的群众路线的时候必须注意的问题。
    实践的经验告诉我们，党的群众路线和阶级路线是统一而不可分的。我们所实行的是阶级的群众路线，不是离开阶级路线去谈抽象的群众路线。党中央在今年8月间公布的关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中写道：“小社并大，转为人民公社，是当前广大群众的共同要求，贫农、下中农是坚决拥护的，大部分上中农也是赞成的，我们要依靠贫农、下中农，充分发动群众，展开鸣放辩论，团结大部分赞成并大社、转公社的上中农，克服另一部分上中农的动摇，揭穿和击退地主富农的造谣破坏，使广大农民在思想解放自觉自愿的基础上并大社、转公社，防止强迫命令。”这一段决议已经把我们党在人民公社化运动中的阶级路线，也就是群众路线的根本原则做了规定。我们应该在今后的工作中继续按照这个规定，把群众路线和阶级路线正确地统一起来。
    为了坚持贯彻群众路线，目前在人民公社中必须健全民主集中制，更加关心群众的生活。北京郊区的人民公社最近在讨论分配问题、改进经营管理、巩固和发展公社等方面所采取的民主化步骤，更加鼓舞了广大社员参加生产劳动的积极性和创造性。我们现在还必须进一步把公社的民主集中制的精神，普遍地贯彻到公社的经济活动、政治活动和民兵组织的军事活动等各个方面去。    （文中插题是编者加的）
