    Make Progress in Studies, Labor Regularly, Rest Happily
    History Department of Beijing Normal University Comprehensively Arranges Time and Establishes Normal Order for All Work
    (Our report) Beijing Normal University's History Department, using the method of "overall planning, layer-by-layer planning, everyone's planning, and leaving room for flexibility," has comprehensively arranged all its work this semester, establishing a new educational order that integrates teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, gradually improving the quality of teaching.
    Under the leadership of the school's Party committee, the department's Party general branch and office first made overall arrangements for study, labor, and rest time. Within a year, there is one month of vacation, three months of labor, and eight months of study. During the three months of labor, half the time is spent by classes rotating to work in the countryside and factories collectively, and half the time is spent doing labor at the school. When students are at school, they study five days a week, labor one day, and rest one day. Out of the weekly sixty-six class hours, socialist and communist education, history major courses, and scientific research occupy fifty hours, while productive labor, running schools, militia training, and sports activities occupy sixteen hours. Under this general arrangement, each department, class, and student, in conjunction with their own circumstances, also has a schedule. Unified arrangements have been made for student self-study, discussion, and meeting times, so that the time for various tasks does not encroach on each other and proceeds in an overlapping manner. After this arrangement, in addition to eight hours of sleep each day and two to three hours of rest and free time in the morning, noon, and evening, students also retain a certain amount of flexibility each week to complete some temporary tasks at any time. Teachers also have more time to prepare lessons and strengthen learning guidance for students.
    With labor time fixed, it is also easier for students to conduct scientific research in a planned way in conjunction with their majors during labor. Third and fourth-year students regularly go to nearby factories to work and run schools, and to organs and primary and secondary schools, etc., to run schools and teach part-time. This is better than students going to affiliated middle schools for "internships" for a few weeks only near graduation, and can better train students' teaching abilities. When concentrating on working in the countryside and factories, students also conduct surveys and write investigation reports and histories of the working people. Some of the factory histories, mine histories, and revolutionary histories of old revolutionary base areas written by students have already been published.
    Because the time for study, labor, and rest is well arranged, teaching, productive labor, and scientific research are integrated, and the initiative and enthusiasm of teachers and students in teaching and learning are better brought into play. Fourth-year students in this department have read more Marxist-Leninist classics since the beginning of this semester than in the past three years. Students said when talking about their current study situation: We read more books, have more comprehensive knowledge, and get regular exercise. "Dead history" has been turned into "living history." At the same time, the students' lives are also more active than in the past. The department has established a cultural troupe, and when resting, there are melodious songs. Students can see a movie or play once a week. On Sundays, according to their preferences, some read novels, some visit exhibitions, and some often invite worker-peasant friends they made while working in the countryside and factories to get together. Pleasant rest and sufficient sleep also make students more energetic in their studies and labor.

    学习进步  劳动经常  休息愉快
    北京师大历史系全面安排时间各项工作建立正常秩序
    本报讯  北京师范大学历史系以“统筹安排、层层安排、人人安排、留有余力”的办法，在本学期全面安排了各项工作，建立起教学、生产劳动和科学研究互相结合的新的教育秩序，使教学质量逐步提高。
    在学校党委的领导下，这个系的党总支和办公室首先统筹安排了学习、劳动和休息的时间。在一年内，休假一月，劳动三月，学习八月。在三个月的劳动时间中，一半时间分班轮流集体下乡下厂劳动，一半时间在校劳动。学生在校时每周学习五天，劳动一天，休息一天。在每周的六十六节课中，社会主义、共产主义教育、历史专业的课程和科学研究等占五十节，生产劳动、办学、民兵训练和体育活动占十六节。在这个总的安排下，各系、各班和每个学生又结合自己的情况，排有日程表。对学生自学、讨论和开会时间，都作了统一安排，使各项工作时间，互不侵占，交叉进行。这样安排以后，学生们每天除有八小时睡眠和早、中、晚有二、三小时休息和自由支配的时间外，每周还留有一定的机动能力，以便随时完成一些临时任务。教师也有了更多的备课和对学生加强学习辅导的时间。
    劳动时间固定下来，也便于学生们在劳动中有计划地结合所学专业进行科学研究。三、四年级学生定期到附近的工厂边劳动、边办学，到机关和中、小学等十个各种类型的学校办学和兼课，这比过去学生临近毕业时才到附属中学“实习”几周，更能锻炼学生的教学工作能力。在集中下乡下厂劳动时，学生们还要作调查研究，写调查报告和劳动人民的历史。学生们写的厂史、矿史和老革命根据地的革命史，有的已经出版。
    由于学习、劳动和休息的时间安排得好，教学、生产劳动和科学研究互相结合了起来，也更好地发挥了师生们在教学和学习中的主动性和积极性。这个系的四年级学生，从这学期开学以来，读的马列主义经典著作就比过去三年读的还多。学生们在谈到他们现在的学习情况时说：书读得多，知识全面，锻炼经常，“死历史”学成“活历史”了。同时，学生们的生活内容也比过去更加活跃。系里成立了文工队，休息时，歌声悠扬。学生们每周能看到一次电影或戏。星期日，根据各人的喜爱，有的看小说，有的去参观展览会，有的还常约他们在下乡下厂劳动中交上的工农朋友聚会。愉快的休息，足够的睡眠，也使学生们更加精神饱满地学习和劳动。
