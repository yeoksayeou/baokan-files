Where There are Blast Furnaces, Cement Can Be Made
Ma'anshan Uses Slag to Make Cement with Low Cost, High Strength, and Good Erosion Resistance

According to a report in the Anhui Daily, the Ma'anshan Cement Plant uses blast furnace slag from the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company to produce non-clinker cement. In just over five months, they produced more than 2,800 tons of cement (some of which was blended material), successfully solving the problem of insufficient cement supply in Ma'anshan. Their experience proves that cement can be produced wherever there are blast furnaces. This is a good experience for developing the cement industry.

Using slag to make cement is an advanced Soviet experience. This spring, the Ma'anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction department to use this experience to produce cement through self-reliance. At that time, they converted an old cement mixer into a ball mill. The hot iron slag flowing from the blast furnace was crushed by cold water, dried, and then loaded into the ball mill for pulverization, finally producing a batch of low-grade cement. Chemical tests proved that this cement could be used for general industrial construction. In early April, Ma'anshan City formally prepared to build a cement plant based on this experiment. In late June, the plant officially started producing cement. Initially, due to lack of experience, the cement produced could only be used as a blending material. After September, they explored a set of experiences, mastered the proportioning and machine performance, and produced non-clinker cement above grade 200.

The cement made from slag by the Ma'anshan Cement Plant is cheap and of good quality. This year, the city used this cement to pour the foundations of dozens of small blast furnaces, and transferred part of it to support industrial construction in Hefei, Wuhu, Dangtu, and He County. According to user feedback and test results, it has been proven that this cement can not only be used for general above-ground, underground, and underwater buildings, but also for the foundations of small blast furnaces and general equipment foundations, reservoirs, and other corrosive projects. The longer the project poured with this cement lasts, the greater the later strength. This cement still has some shortcomings, such as the alkalinity rate and sand acid rate are not easy to control, and the storage period is short; but its erosion resistance is better than high-alumina cement and silicate cement.

The Ma'anshan Cement Plant is summarizing its experience and actively preparing for production in 1959. They have also sent people to the Nanjing China Cement Plant for production internships, and have initially mastered the technology of using slag to produce slag silicate cement above grade 400. Using 70% slag powder, mixed with 30% clinker (clinker is made by mixing and burning yellow clay, lime, coal powder, and iron powder), and pulverizing it in a ball mill, slag silicate cement above grade 400 can be made.

    哪里有高炉哪里就能造水泥 
    马鞍山用矿渣做的水泥成本低，强度大，抗侵蚀性好
    据安徽日报消息  马鞍山市水泥厂用马鞍山钢铁公司的高炉矿渣生产无熟料水泥，五个多月生产水泥二千八百多吨（其中有一部分是掺合料），出色地解决了马鞍山市水泥供应不足的问题。他们的经验证明：哪里有高炉哪里就能生产水泥。这是发展水泥工业的一项好经验。
    用矿渣做水泥，是苏联的一项先进经验。今年春天，中共马鞍山市委曾指示马鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门运用这项经验，自力更生生产水泥。当时，他们把一部破旧的水泥拌和机改装成一部球磨机，高炉流出的热铁渣经冷水冲碎，晒干后，即装进球磨机粉碎，终于生产出一批低标号水泥。化验证明，这种水泥可以用于一般工业建设。4月初，马鞍山市根据这个试验，正式筹建了一座水泥厂。6月下旬，这个厂正式生产水泥。开始时，由于经验不足，生产的水泥只能作掺合料用。9月份以后，他们摸索出了一套经验，掌握了配料比例和机器性能，生产出了二百号以上的无熟料水泥。
    马鞍山市水泥厂用矿渣造的水泥，价钱便宜，质量也很好。这个市今年用这种水泥浇筑了几十座小高炉基础，并调出一部分支援了合肥、芜湖、当涂、和县等地的工业建设。根据用户的反映和化验结果，证明这种水泥不仅可以用于一般的地上、地下及水中的建筑物，还可以用于小高炉基础和一般设备基础、贮水池等具有侵蚀性的工程。用这种水泥浇灌的工程时间越久，后期强度越大。这种水泥在目前还存在着一些缺点，如碱性率和砂酸率不好控制，储存期较短等；但它比高铝水泥、矽酸盐水泥的抗侵蚀性要好。
    马鞍山市水泥厂正在总结经验，并且积极进行1959年的生产准备工作。他们还派人到南京中国水泥厂进行生产实习，初步掌握了用矿渣制四百号以上的矿渣矽酸盐水泥的技术。用70％的矿渣粉，掺上30％的熟料（熟料是黄粘土、石灰、煤粉、铁粉拌和烧制成功的），经球磨粉碎后，即可制成四百号以上的矿渣矽酸盐水泥。（附图片）
