Afro-Asian Economic Conference

The Afro-Asian Economic Conference opened in Cairo on the 8th. Representatives from thirty-nine countries and regions in Asia and Africa are participating in the conference, along with observers from Europe and other regions.

The purpose of the Afro-Asian Economic Conference is to strengthen economic cooperation between the peoples of Asian and African countries. Judging from the initiation and preparation of this conference, it is in line with the spirit of the Bandung Afro-Asian Conference, the Cairo Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, and the Accra All-African People's Conference, all of which advocated unity and cooperation among Asian and African peoples in the struggle for independence and economic development.

The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, which closed on January 1, 1958, emphasized in its resolution on economic issues: "The peoples of Asia and Africa find that in their current liberation movement, they must cooperate closely not only politically but also economically. They realize that without developing their economies, their independence and the material and cultural standards of their societies cannot be maintained. They believe that in our current era, when imperialist countries are uniting their forces, they should stand united. The peoples of Asia and Africa believe that they should work together to develop their economies and coordinate their plans on the basis of mutual benefit." To this end, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference specifically suggested inviting the federations of chambers of commerce and commerce in Asian and African countries to hold a meeting in Cairo at the end of 1958 to "study ways to expand commercial exchanges and enhance economic cooperation among the countries of the Afro-Asian group."

The preparatory committee meeting for the Afro-Asian Economic Conference was held in Cairo from August 16 to 18 this year. The nine countries participating in the preparatory committee were the United Arab Republic, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iraq, China, Tunisia, Japan, and Sudan. The preparatory meeting suggested that a conference be held in Cairo from December 8 to 11, and decided to invite representatives from commercial, industrial, and agricultural federations of all Asian and African countries to participate in the conference. The preparatory meeting also suggested discussing the following four issues: 1. Studying ways to establish and promote economic, technical, and financial cooperation between Asian and African countries; 2. Studying the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries and estimating its impact on Asian and African countries; 3. Studying the difficulties in transferring funds between Asian and African countries and solutions to these problems; 4. Establishing a central organization to coordinate economic cooperation among national chambers of commerce and studying the issue of making recommendations on economic cooperation to national governments.

    亚非经济会议
    亚非经济会议8日在开罗开幕了。参加大会的有亚非两洲的三十九个国家和地区的代表，还有欧洲和其他地区国家的一些观察员。
    亚非经济会议的目的是加强亚非国家人民之间的经济合作。从这次会议的发起和筹备情况来看，它是同万隆亚非会议、开罗亚非人民团结大会和阿克拉全非人民大会的精神一脉相连的，这三个会议都主张亚非人民团结合作争取独立和发展经济。
    1958年1月1日闭幕的亚非人民团结大会曾经在关于经济问题的决议中强调指出：“亚非各国人民发现，在他们目前的解放运动中，不仅必须在政治方面而且必须在经济方面紧密合作。他们认识到，不发展他们的经济，他们的独立和社会的物质和文化水平就无法维持。他们认为，在目前我们这个时代，当帝国主义国家正在把力量联合起来时，他们应该团结一致。亚非各国人民认为，他们在发展经济和在互惠互利基础上协调彼此的计划方面，应该通力合作。”亚非人民团结大会为此具体地建议邀请亚非各国的商会联合会和商会在1958年年底在开罗举行会议，“研究亚非集团国家扩大商业交往和增进经济合作的办法”。
    今年8月16至18日在开罗举行了亚非经济会议筹备委员会会议。参加筹备委员会的有阿拉伯联合共和国、加纳、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、中国、突尼斯、日本和苏丹九个国家。筹备会议建议在12月8日至11日在开罗举行会议，并决定邀请所有的亚非国家的商业、工业和农业联合会的代表参加会议。筹备会议并建议讨论下列四个问题：一、研究建立和促进亚非国家之间的经济、技术和财政合作的办法，二、研究西欧六国“共同市场”和估计它对亚非国家的影响，三、研究亚非国家转账方面的困难和解决办法，四、建立中央机构协调各国商会经济合作和研究向各国政府提出关于经济合作的建议的问题。
