Organizing Veteran Cadres for Literary Creation
Shanghai Housing Management Bureau Liu Fuzhi

    During the fourth stage of the rectification movement, Comrade Zhu Daonan, the Party Secretary of our Bureau, in an enlarged Party Committee meeting, in order to help a Party Committee member correctly understand the relationship between the individual and the organization, talked about his difficult experiences fighting the enemy in Haifeng and Lufeng. All the comrades present were moved to tears. What a vivid history of struggle, what an inspiring communist teaching material! At that time, we wanted to write it down, but because our minds were not liberated and we were busy with work, we never got around to it.

    It was not until the higher Party Committee issued instructions to write books that we formally brought up the issue of organizing veteran cadres to engage in literary creation, using their own revolutionary struggle history as the subject matter, for discussion by the Party Committee. The Party Committee agreed with our opinion, pointing out that this was an arduous and glorious political task, requiring us to treat it as one of our central tasks and list important themes as key creations to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

    Whether veteran cadres can write excellent literary works was a matter of some debate. Some people believed that veteran cadres were old, had a lower level of education, and were mostly leading comrades who were very busy with work. They might not have the desire to create, and even if they did, they might not be able to write well. Moreover, the struggles experienced by veteran cadres were difficult for others to understand, and it was impossible to find someone to write on their behalf. If we followed this line of reasoning, we wouldn't be able to write anything at all. After analysis, we felt that veteran cadres had rich experience in struggle; high political understanding and strong powers of observation; and a firm class stand with clear love and hate. These were the most reliable guarantees that they could write good works. In specific contacts, we found that veteran cadres had a strong desire to create, and this desire was not just to show something to others, but was driven by a sense of political responsibility. For example, Comrade Zhu Daonan joined the revolution in 1926. He experienced the May 21st Incident, the Guangzhou Uprising, and the Haifeng-Lufeng struggle. This was a very arduous and magnificent history of struggle. Because the struggle was so cruel, almost all the comrades who were together at the time sacrificed themselves. So he said, "I have the responsibility to write this book and leave it to future generations, so that they know how hard it was to obtain our life today." Another veteran cadre, Comrade Zheng Xiangxun, participated in the Long March of the First Front Army. He also wanted to tell people about this experience through literary form. Although his own cultural level was low, he overcame many difficulties and used several years of spare time to write 40,000 to 50,000 words of Long March memoir fragments. Don't these situations powerfully illustrate that veteran cadres have a high sense of political responsibility towards creation!

    In the process of organizing veteran cadres for literary creation, the biggest difficulties encountered were time and guidance. They are mostly responsible cadres and are much busier than ordinary people; due to the tense environment in the past, they were somewhat limited in their cultural studies. However, difficulties are not insurmountable. We relied on the leadership of the Party Committee and received great help from the Municipal Party Committee, gradually solving the difficulties. To facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the historical background at the time of creation, and to save veteran cadres from spending a lot of time collecting materials, we collected relevant information for them. At the same time, we also introduced Li Liuru's "Sixty Years of Change" to the authors, so that they could learn some creative methods from it. Divisions of labor were also made among leading cadres, so that veteran cadres with creative tasks could set aside a certain amount of working time for creation. In order to save time, we also adopted the method of shorthand, with veteran cadres dictating, first recording all the materials in shorthand, and then asking professional writers to jointly organize, process, and improve them. Everyone believes that this is a method that is fast, good, and economical. Work is now progressing smoothly. Of course, in this new work, we will encounter many difficulties, but as long as we are clear in our minds that this is a glorious political task, closely rely on the leadership of the Party, and put politics in command, any difficulties can be overcome.

    组织老干部进行文艺创作
    上海房管局  刘辅之
    在整风运动进入第四阶段时，我局党委书记朱道南同志在一次党委扩大会议上，为了帮助一位党委委员正确认识个人与组织的关系，谈了一段自己在海丰、陆丰时与敌人斗争的艰苦经历，与会的同志听了后没有一个不掉泪的。这是多么生动的斗争史，多么具有感染力的共产主义教材呵！当时我们就想把它写出来，但因思想没有解放，工作又忙，一直未动笔。
    直到上级党委发出写书指示后，我们才正式把组织老干部，以自己的革命斗争史为题材，进行文艺创作的问题提请党委会讨论。党委同意了我们的意见，指出这是一件艰巨又光荣的政治任务，要我们作为中心工作之一，并将重要题材列为迎接建国十周年的重点创作。
    老干部能不能写出优秀的文艺作品，是有一番议论的。有人认为老干部年龄大，文化较低，又大都是领导同志，工作很忙，不一定有创作的欲望，即使有也不一定能写好，况且老干部的斗争经历别人难以体会，又不能找人代笔。按照这样看法推下去，根本就不能写了。经过分析，我们觉得老干部斗争经历丰富；政治水平高，观察力强；阶级立场坚定，爱憎分明。这些就是能够写出好作品的最可靠保证。在具体接触中，我们发觉老干部是有着强烈的创作欲望的，而且这种欲望还并不是要搞点东西给人看看，而是由一种政治责任感在驱使着的。例如朱道南同志是1926年参加革命的，他经历了马日事变、广州暴动、海陆丰斗争等，这是一部非常艰巨、非常壮烈的斗争史，由于斗争的残酷，当时在一起的同志差不多都牺牲了；所以他讲，“我有这个责任把这本书写出来，留给后代，让他们知道我们今天的生活得来多么不容易”。另一位老干部郑祥勋同志是参加红一方面军长征的，他也很想把这段经历通过文艺形式告诉人们。虽然自己文化水平较低，但也克服了重重困难，用了几年的工作空隙，写出了四、五万字的长征回忆片断。这些情况不是有力地说明老干部对待创作有着高度的政治责任感么！
    在组织老干部进行文艺创作的过程中，遇到的最大困难是时间和辅导问题。他们大都是负责干部，工作比一般人忙得多；由于过去的环境紧张，在文化学习上曾受到过一定的限制。但是困难并不是不能克服的，我们依靠了党委的领导，得到了市委很大的帮助，逐步解决了困难。为了便于创作时较全面地了解当时的历史背景，免得老干部在搜集材料上花很多时间，我们替他们搜集了有关资料。同时还介绍李六如的“六十年的变迁”给作者看，以便从中学习一些创作方法。在领导干部间也作了分工，使有创作任务的老干部能抽出一定的工作时间进行创作。我们为了节约时间，还采用了速记的办法，由老干部口述，先将全部材料速记下来，再请专业作家共同整理，加工提高。大家认为这是多快好省的办法。现在工作正在顺利进行。当然在这一新的工作中，还会遇到很多困难，但是只要思想上明确这是一件光荣的政治任务，紧紧依靠党的领导，政治挂帅，任何困难都是能克服的。
