    Tianjin People Subdue the Hai River
    The Important Hai River Transformation Project—The Sluice Gate is Successfully Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 28th: The Hai River Sluice Gate construction project, one of the main projects for transforming the Hai River, was completed on the 28th. More than 20,000 people from all walks of life in Tianjin and the labor army fighting on the construction site held a completion ceremony on the site that day to celebrate the great victory in taming the Hai River.
    The other two main projects for transforming the Hai River—the fishing boat lock and the barrage dam—have been completed one after another. The Tianjin sewage system reconstruction project, another project, will be fully completed on the 30th of this month. By then, the Tianjin's Hai River transformation project will be completed, and the Hai River will change its historical appearance of being indistinguishable between fresh and salt water, and entering a new historical period of "separation of fresh and salt water, diversion of clear and turbid water."
    On the 28th, the Hai River had a brand new look. The barrage dam, which is thirteen meters high and three hundred and fifty meters long, has transformed this tidal river, which has been "indistinguishable between fresh and salt water" for many years, into an artificial reservoir. On the left side of the dam, the upper part of the magnificent sluice gate is filled with red flags. At 9:30 in the morning, the completion ceremony officially began. After Wang Baozhen, director of the Hai River Sluice Gate Construction Headquarters, reported on the construction process, Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke. Comrade Lin Tie said: The successful completion of the Hai River Sluice Gate project is a great happy event for the people of Tianjin and also a great happy event for the people of Hebei Province. Because eradicating the Hai River has been a long-standing wish of the people of Hebei Province and Tianjin, and it is a major measure for the Party to eliminate floods and droughts and promote leap forward in production. The smooth completion of the Hai River Sluice Gate project plays a significant role in promoting and encouraging the Hai River eradication project. Then, Li Gengtao, Mayor of Tianjin, spoke at the meeting. He said that the completion of the Hai River transformation project has changed the historical appearance of the Hai River and realized the wish of "separation of fresh and salt water, diversion of clear and turbid water." From now on, the Hai River will become a tamed river, which will contribute more to Tianjin's industrial and agricultural production, transportation and people's lives.
    The Hai River Sluice Gate construction project started on July 1st of this year, with more than 100,000 workers, farmers, soldiers, government cadres, students, and citizens participating in the construction work. The labor army created many moving deeds, new records continued to appear, and 157 advanced collectives and 7,422 advanced producers emerged. Factories, enterprises, government agencies and the vast residents of Tianjin strongly supported the project. The employees of more than 100 units that processed materials for the sluice gate construction project completed the processing tasks in a timely manner, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. In the process of construction, it also received enthusiastic support from the people of more than a dozen provinces and cities such as Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Shanghai.

    天津人民伏海河
    改造海河的重要工程—节制闸胜利竣工
    新华社天津28日电  改造海河的主要工程项目之一海河节制闸建闸工程，在28日竣工。天津市各界人民和战斗在工地上的劳动大军两万多人，当天在工地上举行了竣工典礼大会，庆祝驯服海河的巨大胜利。
    改造海河的另外两项主体工程——渔船闸和拦河大坝，都在以前陆续完工。另一项工程天津市污水系统改建工程，将在本月30日全部竣工。到那时，天津市改造海河的工程就全部结束，海河就改变了历年来咸淡不分、清浊混流的面貌，进入“咸淡分家、清浊分流”的新的历史时期。
    28日，海河的面貌焕然一新。高达十三公尺、长三百五十公尺的拦河大坝，使这条多少年来“咸淡不分”的潮汐河，一变成为人造水库。大坝左侧，巍峨壮观的节制闸的闸身上部红旗招展。上午九点半，竣工典礼正式开始。海河建闸指挥部主任王葆珍报告了建闸经过以后，中共河北省委第一书记林铁讲了话。林铁同志说：海河建闸工程的胜利竣工，是天津人民的大喜事，也是河北省人民的大喜事。因为根治海河是河北省和天津市人民多年来的愿望，是党消灭水旱灾害、促进生产跃进的一项重大措施。海河建闸工程的顺利完成，对根治海河工程来说，起着很大的促进和鼓舞作用。接着，天津市市长李耕涛在会上讲了话。他说，海河改造工程的完工，改变了海河的历史面貌，实现了“咸淡分家、清浊分流”的愿望。从此，海河成为一条驯服的河流，将为天津市工农业生产、交通运输和人民生活各方面，贡献更大的力量。
    海河节制闸建闸工程是从今年7月1日开工的，有十万多工人、农民、战士、机关干部、学生、市民等参加了建闸劳动。劳动大军们创造了许多动人事迹，新纪录不断出现，涌现出先进集体一百五十七个，先进生产者七千四百二十二名。天津市各工厂企业机关和广大居民，大力支援这项工程。为建闸工程进行加工的一百多个单位职工，都及时地完成了加工任务，保证了工程的顺利进行。在施工过程中，还得到了黑龙江、广东、福建、江苏、上海等十几个省市人民的热情支援。
