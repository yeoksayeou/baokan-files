Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 10th: The newly built, modern Harbin Turbine Plant officially started production today. This plant, along with the closely related Harbin Boiler Plant and Electric Machinery Plant, forms a complete power station equipment manufacturing base, known as the "Three Sisters" factories. The task of the three factories is to manufacture complete sets of power generation equipment for the country.

The construction project of the Harbin Turbine Plant was originally planned to be completed in two phases; however, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the increasing demand for power equipment, the state decided to combine the two phases into one. Since the start of the plant's construction in March 1956, thanks to the selfless labor of the construction workers, the two phases of construction were completed in just over two years. The speed of the first phase of construction, compared to the two-phase separate construction plan, was advanced by two years.

This plant, due to the implementation of the principle of simultaneous construction, installation, and production, has made great production achievements during the construction period. Before this year's National Day, it manufactured the first domestically produced 25,000-kilowatt high-temperature, high-pressure turbine. Following this, in November, it manufactured the second one; currently, a 50,000-kilowatt high-temperature, high-pressure turbine has begun to be manufactured.

The reason why the Harbin Turbine Plant showed great production power during the construction period is mainly due to the factory's Party committee fully relying on the masses and constantly overcoming various conservative ideas. After the measure of completing the two phases of the project at once was determined, some people believed that there was not enough time for preparation, which would cause artificial tension, and also said that speeding up would not guarantee the quality of the project. In implementing the principle of simultaneous construction and production, the struggle between the two ideologies became even more acute. Some people shouted that although the workshops had been built, the equipment was incomplete, the personnel were insufficient, and the workers were not skilled in operation. That is to say, the conditions were not sufficient. However, the factory Party organization led the masses of employees to resolutely implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and each piece of equipment was put into operation as soon as it was installed. At this time, some people said again: "It's too irregular." The factory Party organization then raised the question of "Letting the installed machine sleep, or work?" and launched a great debate among the workers. The workers said: To manufacture turbines for the country early, we must give full play to the role of the equipment. When the masses were mobilized, some people questioned whether turbines could be made during the simultaneous construction and production. At this time, the Party committee again launched a great debate among the workers, and as a result, not only was the 25,000-kilowatt turbine made, but also the 50,000-kilowatt large turbine was started.

During the construction period, the Harbin Turbine Plant received strong support from the Soviet Union. The design provided by the Soviet Union was advanced, and the main equipment was modern. At the same time, the Soviet Union also sent excellent experts, who played a great role in the construction and production of the factory.

The turbine is indispensable to thermal power plants. A complete set of power generation equipment is composed of a boiler, a turbine, and a generator. After a 25,000-kilowatt high-temperature, high-pressure turbine is matched with the corresponding boiler and generator, the electricity generated in one year, if used for steelmaking, can refine more than 2.6 million tons; if used for lighting, it can supply a city with a population of 2.5 million.

At today's opening ceremony, Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, Chen Lei, Deputy Governor of Heilongjiang Province, Wang Daohan, Deputy Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Fedorov, representative of the Economic Liaison Bureau of the Soviet Foreign Economic Liaison Committee in China, Guo Weiren, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, and Soviet experts stationed in the factory attended the meeting to congratulate them. At the meeting, Chen Lei, Deputy Director of the National Acceptance Committee, read out the acceptance appraisal, pointing out that the overall quality of the construction and installation projects of the whole plant was rated as excellent. At the meeting, the factory staff presented banners to the Soviet experts and representatives of relevant domestic units who helped build the factory. At 1:30 p.m., the factory announced the official start of production.

    哈尔滨汽轮机厂开工生产
    新华社哈尔滨10日电  新建的现代化的哈尔滨汽轮机厂今天正式开工生产。这个厂同紧密相联的哈尔滨锅炉厂、电机厂组成了一个完整的电站设备制造基地，人们称它们为“三姊妹”工厂。三个工厂的任务，是共同为国家成套地制造发电设备。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂的建设工程原计划分两期完成；随着工农业生产的大跃进，电力设备需要量增大，因此国家决定把两期工程合为一期建成。从1956年3月厂区工程动工以后，由于建筑工人的忘我劳动，结果只用两年多的时间便完成了两期建设工程。一期建成的速度同两期分建比较，提前了两年。
    这个厂由于贯彻了边建设、边安装、边生产的方针，在建厂期间便做出了巨大的生产成就。在今年国庆节前夕，它制造出了第一台国产二万五千瓩的高温高压汽轮机，接着在11月里又制造出了第二台；目前一台五万瓩高温高压的汽轮机已开始制造。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂之所以在建厂期间就显示了巨大的生产威力，主要是工厂党委充分依靠群众、不断克服各种保守思想的结果。当两期工程一次建成的措施确定以后，有些人便认为准备工作来不及，会造成人为的紧张，还说快了不能保证工程质量。在贯彻边建设、边生产的方针当中，两种思想的斗争更加尖锐。有些人叫喊着：虽然车间建成了，但是设备不全，人员不够，工人操作不熟练。就是说：条件不够。但是工厂党组织领导职工群众坚决贯彻了多快好省的建设路线，设备安装一台就开动一台。这时又有些人说：“太不正规化了。”工厂党组织便提出“让安装好的机器睡觉，还是干活”的课题，发动工人进行大辩论。工人们说：要早为国家制造汽轮机，就得发挥设备的作用。群众发动起来了，可是在边建设边生产中能不能做成汽轮机，有些人又提出了问号。这时党委又发动工人进行了大辩论，结果不仅做出了二万五千瓩的汽轮机，而且还开始做五万瓩的大汽轮机了。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂在建厂期间，得到苏联的大力支援。苏联供给的设计是先进的，主要设备都是现代化的。同时，苏联还派来了优秀的专家，他们对工厂的建设和生产都起了很大作用。
    汽轮机是火力发电站不能缺少的，成套发电设备是由锅炉、汽轮机、发电机组成的。一台二万五千瓩的高温高压汽轮机同相应的锅炉发电机配套以后，一年发出的电力如果用来炼钢，能炼二百六十多万吨；用来照明，可以供二百五十万人口的城市用。
    在今天的开工生产典礼大会上，中共黑龙江省委书记强晓初，黑龙江省副省长陈雷、第一机械工业部副部长汪道涵、苏联对外经济联络委员会驻华经济联络局代表菲德洛夫、中共哈尔滨市委书记郭伟人和驻厂的苏联专家都到会祝贺。会上国家验收委员会副主任陈雷宣读了验收鉴定书，指出全厂建筑、安装工程质量总评为优等。会上，工厂职工向帮助建厂的苏联专家和国内各有关单位代表赠送了锦旗。下午一时三十分，工厂宣告正式开工生产。
