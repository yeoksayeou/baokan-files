Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 7th: Our correspondent Liu Guiliang reports: West Berlin, which has remained under the military occupation of the United States, Britain, and France for more than thirteen years after the war, will hold another city council election on the 7th. Regardless of whether the result of this election is the Social Democratic Party ruling alone or a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union, as long as the foreign occupation forces do not withdraw, West Berlin will remain a springboard for the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany to threaten and subvert the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, and will remain a malignant tumor for Western countries to create tension and escalate the Cold War in the center of Europe.

Looking back at the history of the past thirteen years, it can be clearly seen how West Berlin became a malignant tumor while militarism and monopoly capital were eradicated in the democratic sector of Berlin and the entire German Democratic Republic embarked on the broad road of socialism.

Just as in West Germany, the United States, Britain, and France, after occupying the three districts of West Berlin in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, did not earnestly implement the basic principles of eradicating German militarism and Nazism solemnly declared in the Potsdam Agreement from day one. As early as December 1946, during the first election in Greater Berlin, the American occupation authorities took the lead in putting away the anti-fascist banner in West Berlin and shouting the anti-communist fallacy of "hateful Bolsheviks."

With the connivance of the Western occupying powers, Nazi fascists and militarists revived. More than thirteen years after the end of the war, there are as many as 111 German militarist groups in West Berlin, including the notorious "Steel Helmet," "Paratrooper Veterans League," and "SS Veterans Mutual Aid Association." As of September this year, more than 24,000 former Nazi activists were employed in West Berlin's municipal institutions, and 32% of the police force were Nazis. In the West Berlin courts, 33 Nazi judges have been reinstated in important positions.

There are as many as 83 well-known spy agencies of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany in West Berlin, including the American "Military Intelligence Detachment," "Military Intelligence Office," "Central Intelligence Agency," "Special Investigations Office," "Counterintelligence Corps," "Naval Intelligence Office," and "Air Force Intelligence Office," among others. These spy agencies have done everything evil. The "June 17th Berlin incident" in 1953 was planned jointly by the American and West German governments. When the counter-revolutionary incident occurred in Hungary at the end of October 1956, American and West German agents tried to plot an armed riot in Berlin, but failed. Over the years, the subversive conspiracies, espionage arson, assassinations, poisonings, and explosions cracked in the democratic sector of Berlin have almost all been related to the American spy agencies in West Berlin.

The United States, Britain, and France not only undermined the unity of the city council and the city government in the administrative affairs of Greater Berlin from the very beginning of their occupation of West Berlin, but also created division in the economic field. In June 1948, the Western countries violated the Allied Control Council's agreement on currency reform throughout Germany and unilaterally reformed the currency in West Germany. Then, they violated the four-power garrison commanders' agreement on the unified use of the currency of the Soviet occupation zone in Greater Berlin at that time, and announced the use of the West German mark in West Berlin. They also created a black market exchange rate between East and West marks by administrative order of the Western occupying powers, instigating West Germany to use West Berlin to carry out economic sabotage against the German Democratic Republic.

The Western countries also unscrupulously violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and never banned monopoly capital such as Siemens, Lorenz, and AEG, which had served Hitler's war of aggression, in West Berlin. On the contrary, with American loans, these large corporations quickly grew stronger again. In the past two years, the three Western powers have even more brazenly violated the four-power agreement on prohibiting West Berlin corporations from engaging in arms production. Many corporations have increasingly accepted large military orders from the Western occupying forces and the West German Ministry of Defense.

What is particularly dangerous is that the Western countries regard West Berlin as a "front-line city" deep in the heart of Democratic Germany. They use West Berlin to send all kinds of agents and spies to the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries to carry out evil activities.

No matter how the Western countries sing the praises of "democracy" and "freedom," the 2.2 million residents of West Berlin understand that the West Berlin city council election on the 7th is just another farce under foreign occupation. A malignant tumor is still a malignant tumor. Only by removing this malignant tumor, that is, ending the occupied status of Berlin, with the United States, Britain, and France withdrawing their occupation forces from West Berlin, making it a demilitarized free city, will the residents of West Berlin be able to live a peaceful, safe, democratic, and free life.

    西柏林是怎样变成毒瘤的
    新华社柏林7日电  本社记者刘桂梁报道：战后十三年多来仍处在美、英、法三国军事占领下的西柏林，7日又将举行市议会选举，不管这个选举的结果是由社会民主党单独执政或者是由社会民主党同阿登纳的基督教民主联盟联合执政，只要外国占领军一天不撤退，西柏林仍将是美、英、法和西德威胁和颠复德意志民主共和国及其他社会主义国家的跳板，仍将是西方国家在欧洲中心制造紧张局势和加剧冷战的一个毒瘤。
    回顾一下战后十三年多的历史，就可以清楚地看出，在柏林民主区和整个德意志民主共和国根除了军国主义和垄断资本，走上了社会主义康庄大道的同时，西柏林是怎样变成毒瘤的。
    就像在西德一样，美、英、法三国根据波茨坦协定进占柏林西部的三个区后，从头一天起就没有认真地执行波茨坦协定庄严宣布的根除德国军国主义和纳粹主义的基本原则。早在1946年12月间大柏林市举行第一次选举时，美国占领当局就带头在柏林西区收起了反法西斯的旗帜，而叫嚷起“可恶的布尔什维克”的反共滥调来了。
    在西方占领国的纵容下，纳粹法西斯分子和军国主义分子再度复活。战争结束十三年多以后的今天，西柏林的德国军国主义团体已达一百一十一个之多，其中包括臭名昭著的“钢盔队”、“伞兵军人联盟”“党卫军军人互助会”等。到今年9月止，在西柏林的市政机构中任职的前纳粹积极分子有二万四千多名，在警察局人员中有32％是纳粹分子。在西柏林法院里有三十三名纳粹法官重新担任了要职。
    在西柏林的美、英、法和西德的间谍特务机构，著名的就有八十三个，其中包括美国的“军事情报支队”、“军事情报处”、“中央情报局”、“特别调查处”、“反间谍队”、“海军情报处”、“空军情报处”等。这些特务机构做尽了坏事。1953年“六·一七柏林事件”就是美国和西德政府一起策划的。1956年10月末匈牙利发生反革命事件时，当时美国和西德特务又曾想在柏林策划武装暴动，但是没有得逞。历年来在柏林民主区破获的颠复阴谋、特务纵火、暗杀、放毒、爆炸等罪恶案件几乎都同西柏林的美国特务机构有关。
    美、英、法三国不但从进占柏林西区之初起就在大柏林市的行政方面破坏了市议会和市政府的统一，而且在经济方面也制造了分裂。1948年6月，西方国家违反盟国对德管制委员会关于在全德实行币制改革的协议，片面在西德改革了币制，接着又破坏了四国驻军司令关于在大柏林统一使用当时的苏占区币制的协议，而宣布在西柏林使用西德马克，并且以西方占领国的行政命令制造东西马克的黑市比价，唆使西德利用西柏林进行对德意志民主共和国的经济破坏活动。
    西方国家还肆无忌惮地破坏波茨坦协定的规定，从未在西柏林取缔过曾为希特勒侵略战争服务的军火康采恩如西门子、洛伦茨、德国电气总公司等垄断资本，相反，在美国的贷款之下，这些大康采恩很快地重新壮大起来。最近两年来西方三国更变本加厉地公然破坏四大国关于禁止西柏林康采恩企业进行军火生产的协议，许多康采恩越来越多地接受了西方占领军和西德国防部的大量军事订货。
    尤其危险的是，西方国家把西柏林当成深入民主德国心脏的“前线城市”，它们通过西柏林派遣形形色色的特务间谍到德意志民主共和国、苏联和其他社会主义国家去进行罪恶活动。
    不管西方国家如何高唱“民主”、“自由”等滥调，西柏林的二百二十万居民懂得，7日的西柏林市议会选举只不过是在外国占领状态下的又一幕滑稽剧。毒瘤依然是毒瘤，只有割除这个毒瘤，也就是说结束柏林的被占领状态，美、英、法三国占领军撤出西柏林，使它成为非军事化的自由城市，西柏林的居民才有可能过和平安全和民主自由的生活。
