What to Learn from "Ji Lian"?
Yi Ji

The news that the Harbin Ji Lian Machinery Factory used simple machine tools and adopted a modular processing method to manufacture many large-scale equipment caused a sensation across the country. Now, many representatives from all over the country visit every day. After visiting, representatives of many units had active ideas, broadened their horizons, and put forward leap forward opinions based on their specific conditions. After visiting, representatives of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant actively learned from the experience of "Ji Lian" and could refit hundreds of applicable machine tools using only various new and old machine tool spare parts. There was also no need to build factory buildings. The Kaifeng Machinery Factory in Henan also proposed a bold plan to reduce investment by 35% and quadruple its output next year.

However, some people gained nothing after visiting. They hold a skeptical attitude towards the miracles created by others. They believe that this kind of indigenous method is not efficient; the assembled machine tools are not accurate enough; the design and installation of assembly and disassembly are technically complex and not easy to master... and so on. The facts, however, are completely contrary to their views. The multi-sided machine tool built by worker Dong Hongan of Ji Lian Machinery Factory with waste materials can process quadrilaterals, hexagons, and octagons, increasing work efficiency by 70 to 100 times. The multi-spindle drilling machine assembled by eighth-grade fitter Song Zhendong with old steel and motors increased efficiency by 26 times. The special-purpose machine tool put together by seventh-grade fitter Fu Xinchuan ensures the precision requirements for turning the plane large body inner hole. There are many more examples like this. They prove that small machine tools can do big jobs, and simple indigenous machine tools can do "fine" work, and in some respects, they have better results than "foreign" machine tools.

Of course, new things often have advantages and disadvantages at the same time. The question is what we should see as the main thing, and also see its development prospects. Using simple machine tools in a modular way, what are the major shortcomings? At most, it is only some imperfections in development. Everything is in the process of development. From a developmental point of view, nothing in the world is perfect. Compared with new scientific and technological achievements, don't those "foreign" equipment have shortcomings? As long as it can solve practical problems, the manufactured products can be used, and it can build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, this is the greatest superiority, and it is very good. The large-scale equipment manufactured by Ji Lian Machinery Factory is now operating day and night in 210 factories and enterprises in Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Heavy Machinery, and Mining Machinery, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. Believe it or doubt it, the facts are here.

There are also some people who say: "Ji Lian Machinery Factory's technological revolution is good because there are many old technicians." The implication is, "Our factory has fewer old workers, so we can't learn." This is a "theory of conditions." It is a fact that there are more old technicians in this factory. But before this year, their output value had not increased several times. It was only since the Great Leap Forward, after vigorously carrying out mass movements, that the modular method was created. This year's output value can only increase seven times. This means that old workers have relatively rich practical knowledge, and it is beneficial to engage in technological revolution and invention and creation, but it is not the key to determining the problem. The key is to put politics in command, to carry out mass movements vigorously, and to combine the spirit of daring to think and dare to do with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Technology is learned. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that a blank sheet of paper has no burden and can write the most beautiful words and draw the most beautiful pictures. It is certainly very important to have many old workers, but as long as various superstitions are broken, hard work is done, and new and old workers cooperate closely, new workers can quickly become skilled workers. If mass movements are not vigorously carried out and it is thought that adding a few old workers can achieve the same results as Ji Lian Machinery Factory, it is not right. Those who think that the main reason Ji Lian Machinery Factory created miracles is that there are many old workers are precisely reflecting that they have not learned the experience of Ji Lian Machinery Factory well.

The latecomers surpass the former. As long as we earnestly and humbly learn from the experience of Ji Lian Machinery Factory, anyone can create miracles.

    向“机联”学什么？
    伊纪
    哈尔滨机联机械厂使用简易机床并采取积木式加工方法制造了许多大型设备的消息传出以后，轰动了全国。现在每天都有很多代表从全国各地去参观。不少单位的代表参观后思路活动了，眼界扩大了，并根据自己的具体条件提出了跃进意见。长春第一汽车制造厂代表参观后，积极学习“机联”的经验，仅用各种新旧机床后备部件就可改装几百台适用的机床，厂房也用不着盖了。河南开封机械厂也提出减少投资35％，明年产量翻几番的豪迈规划。
    可是，也有一些人参观以后毫无收获。他们对别人创造出来的奇迹抱着怀疑的态度，他们认为：这种土办法效率不高；拼凑的机床精度不够；拼拼拆拆，设计安装，技术复杂，不易掌握……等等。事实却和他们的看法完全相反。机联机械厂工人董洪安用废料造的车多边形机床，可加工四边形、六边形、八边形，提高工作效率七十至一百倍。 八级钳工宋振东用旧钢料，电动机等装配的多轴钻床，提高效率二十六倍。七级钳工傅新传拼成的专用机床，保证了车平面大身内孔的精度要求。像这样的例子还很多。它们证明：用小机床一样能干大活，用简陋的土机床一样能干“精”活，而且在某些方面，比“洋”机床有更好的效果。
    当然，新生的东西往往是优点和缺点同时存在，问题在于我们要看什么是主要的，而且还要看到它的发展前途。用积木式方法使用简易机床，有什么大的缺点，顶多也只是发展中的某些不完善罢了。任何事物都处在发展的过程中。从发展的观点看，世界上没有什么东西是完美无缺的。那些“洋”设备，与新的科学技术成就比较，何尝没有缺点。只要能解决实际问题，制造出来的产品能使用，能又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义，这就是最大的优越性，就很好。机联机械厂造的大型设备，现在正在鞍钢、包钢、武钢、重型机械、矿山机械二百一十个工厂企业中日夜运转着，为国家创造着大批财富。相信也吧，怀疑也吧，事实在这里摆着。
    还有一种人说：“机联机械厂的技术革命搞得好，是因为老技工多。”弦外之音，是“我们厂的老工人少，所以不能学习。”这是一种“唯条件论”思想。这个厂的老技工较多是事实。可是在今年以前，他们的产值并没翻几番，只是大跃进以来，经过大搞群众运动，才创造出积木式的方法。今年的产值才能增长七倍。这就是说，老工人具有比较丰富的实践知识，搞技术革命，搞发明创造是有利的，但并不是决定问题的关键。关键是政治挂帅，是大搞群众运动，是把敢想敢干和实事求是的精神结合起来。技术是学来的。毛泽东同志教导我们，一张白纸没有负担，可以写最美的字，画最美的画。老工人多固然很重要，但是只要破除了各种迷信，苦心钻研，新老工人密切合作，新工人可以很快变成熟练工人。如果不大搞群众运动，以为添几个老工人就能做出机联机械厂那样的成绩来，是不对的。那种认为机联机械厂创造奇迹的主要原因是老工人多的人，恰恰是反映了他们并没有很好学习机联机械厂的经验。
    后来者居上。只要认真地虚心地学习机联机械厂的经验，谁都可以创造奇迹。
