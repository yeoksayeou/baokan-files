The Zhou Shunmei nursing group of Shanghai Guangci Hospital:

Our nursing group, through patient and meticulous care, rescued construction worker Zang Ah Xing from the brink of death after he had been in a coma for more than two months. This is another red flag planted in our hospital's nursing work after the rescue of steelworker Qiu Cai Kang.

Zang Ah Xing was a plumbing and electrical worker. On April 15th of this year, while repairing water pipes, he was unfortunately struck in the head by an iron pipe, resulting in a fractured skull, extradural hemorrhage, and loss of consciousness. After being sent to the hospital, the doctors performed a craniotomy rescue operation, but after the operation, his condition worsened, and he remained unconscious all day, with the pupillary light reflex disappearing and his body temperature rising to forty degrees Celsius. According to foreign literature, such patients have no hope if they do not regain consciousness within two or three days after surgery. The doctors also tried everything possible and invited experts from internal medicine, neurology, and other departments for consultation. They unanimously believed that there was little hope. At this time, the hospital's Party organization called on all comrades in the hospital to rescue all critically ill patients with the spirit of rescuing Qiu Cai Kang. The Party's call strengthened everyone's confidence. Everyone expressed that as long as he had a breath, they would do everything possible to save him.

Ah Xing, in a comatose state, could not eat, sleep, or even move. He kept his mouth and eyes open all day. We used oiled gauze to cover his eyes to prevent corneal damage, and wet gauze to cover his mouth to prevent dust from falling into it. We turned him over every two hours, and someone carefully moved his head. Although we provided such active care, Ah Xing still developed bedsores and became as thin as a skeleton, still unconscious. Some comrades began to lose confidence. At this time, the responsible comrades of the Party organization went to the ward to understand the situation and encourage the medical staff, strengthening our confidence.

Ah Xing had not had a bowel movement for several days, and various enema methods failed to produce results. We used our hands to dig into his anus. When we dug out a lot of stool, we were very happy because this could make Ah Xing more comfortable. His hair was very long, and we were afraid that the barber would contaminate the wound when shaving his head, so we took it upon ourselves to shave his head and beard.

After another period of treatment, although Ah Xing had not regained consciousness, we noticed that he had swallowing movements. Everyone jumped up with joy and quickly fed him a small amount of boiled water and nutritious drinks. Because he did not know how to move his mouth, we used a "dropper" to drip the liquid into his mouth drop by drop. It took more than half an hour to finish a small bowl of liquid, and we fed him very patiently. Two months later, we found that Ah Xing could make simple sounds. The nurses clapped their hands with joy and said, "Ah Xing can talk!" At first, he could not speak clearly, but after three months, his speech became clearer, and his consciousness gradually returned to normal. He could distinguish things and recall the circumstances of his injury three months earlier.

After half a year of day-in and day-out medical treatment and nursing, we have snatched Ah Xing's life back from the clutches of death. Now Ah Xing is fully conscious, and except for slight paralysis in his right hand, he can move all other parts of his body on his own. (Attached picture)

After four months of careful care, Ah Xing has initially recovered his health

    从死亡边缘救活阿兴
    上海广慈医院周顺梅护理小组
    我们护理小组经过耐心、细致的护理，把昏迷了两个多月的建筑工人臧阿兴从死亡的边缘抢救过来。这是我们医院继抢救钢铁工人丘财康之后，在护理工作上插上的又一面红旗。
    臧阿兴是一个水电装修工人，今年4月15日，在装修水管时，不幸被一根铁管击中了头部，顿时颅骨折断，硬脑膜外冲血，神志昏迷。送到医院后，医师们施行开颅抢救手术，但手术后，病情更加恶化，整天昏迷不醒，瞳孔反射都消失了，体温上升到四十度。根据国外文献记载：这样的病人如在手术后二、三天内不清醒过来就没有希望了。医师们也想尽一切办法，请了内科、神经科等专家来会诊，一致认为很少希望。这时，医院党组织号召全院同志要以抢救丘财康的精神，抢救一切垂危病人。党的号召，使大家增强了信心。大家表示：只要他还有一口气，就要尽一切力量来挽救他。
    阿兴在昏迷状态中，不吃、不睡，更不能动弹，整天张着口，开着眼。我们就用油纱布把他的眼睛遮起来，防止角膜受损坏；又用湿纱布遮在他嘴上，不让灰尘掉进他嘴里。每二小时给他翻身一次，并有人小心搬动他的头部。虽然经过这样积极护理，阿兴还是发生褥疮，消瘦得剩一把骨头，依旧昏迷不醒。一部分同志开始失去了信心。这时，党组织负责同志下病房了解情况，鼓励医护人员，加强我们的信心。
    阿兴几天没有大便了，用各种办法灌肠也排不出来，我们就用手去挖他的肛门，当挖出很多大便时，我们很高兴，因为这样能使阿兴舒服些。他的头发很长了，我们怕理发师剃发污染伤口，就自己动手替他剃发、刮胡子，……。
    这样，又经过一个时期的医疗，阿兴虽然没有清醒过来，但我们发现他有吞咽的动作，大家都高兴得跳起来了，连忙拿少量开水和富于营养的饮料喂他，他的嘴不知道动，就用“滴管”一滴一滴朝他嘴里滴，一小碗流汁需要吃半个多小时，我们都是非常耐心地喂他。两个月以后，我们又发现阿兴能发出简单的声音来，护理人员个个乐得拍手说：“阿兴会说话了”。开始时说不清楚，三个月后，话才比较清楚，神志也慢慢地恢复正常了，能辨别事物，也能回忆起自己在三个月前受伤的情形。
    经过这样半年如一日的医疗和护理，我们已经从死神手里夺回了阿兴的生命。现在阿兴已经完全清醒了，除右手稍有瘫痪现象外，其他部分都能自行活动了。（附图片）
    经过四个月的细心护理，阿兴已经初步恢复健康
