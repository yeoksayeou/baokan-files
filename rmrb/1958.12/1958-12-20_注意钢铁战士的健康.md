Pay Attention to the Health of Steel Warriors
    Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Labor Hygiene Research Institute Zhou Tiansheng
    The characteristics of small indigenous blast furnaces, reverberatory furnaces, and puddling furnaces are simple equipment and convenient construction. Under the goal of the whole people running iron and steel and striving to complete 10.7 million tons of steel, this kind of indigenous method of iron and steelmaking has been widely adopted by people all over the country. How can we ensure the health of the steel warriors who are full of energy and enthusiasm under simple labor production conditions, so that they can successfully complete their tasks?
    Recently, we investigated the labor hygiene situation of indigenous iron and steelmaking at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and found that steel warriors suffered from burns, trauma, colds, sore throats, coughs, and other diseases. The reasons are nothing more than the following:
    First, steel warriors have great energy and high enthusiasm, but they are still novices in steelmaking. They lack awareness of safe production and only pay attention to the speed and quantity of steel production, neglecting industrial accidents.
    Second, the furnaces are densely packed, the working surface is small, and the tools are long, and the position is not properly placed, resulting in burns or bumps from sparks or tools.
    Third, the temperature in front of the furnace is quite different from the general temperature. After strenuous labor, they are dripping with sweat and their pores are dilated, and the body's resistance is reduced. If they do not put on clothes when they stop to rest, they are prone to catching a cold. At the same time, the temperature in front of the furnace is high and the radiant heat is extremely strong, which can easily make people's throat and nasal mucosa feel dry and painful.
    In order to prevent the occurrence of diseases and injuries, a safe operating procedure system should be established during operation, such as equipping labor protection products such as safety helmets, gloves, shoe covers, and tinted glasses; after the tools are stained with iron slag, they must be cooled in water first, and then hammered off. After the operation is completed, put the tools in water to cool down first, and then put them flat. Tools and water buckets should be placed in conspicuous and handy places near the furnace. Fuel, raw materials, and refined steel should not be placed in traffic arteries and crowded places. Stand upwind when loading, resting, and operating.
    The distance between each row of furnaces should be at least enough to put down tools. For rows of furnaces, the furnace doors should be opened in the same direction.
    After each steelmaking, the furnace front should be cleaned and watered once to maintain the cleanliness and humidity of the furnace front.
    When going out after work, clothes should be put on to ensure good eating, sleeping, and resting.
    Establish a first-aid kit, and after accidental trauma, wrap and treat it in time to avoid infection and deterioration of the wound.
    In addition, the number of workers and duties per furnace should be reasonably allocated, rest places should be arranged, and non-operators should be prohibited from staying around the furnace.

    注意钢铁战士的健康
    武汉钢铁公司劳动卫生研究所  周天生
    小土高炉、反射炉和炒炉的特点是设备简易，建造方便。在全民大办钢铁，为完成一千零七十万吨钢而奋斗的目标下，这种土法炼钢铁，已广泛的被全国各地人民所采用。怎样在简陋的劳动生产条件下，保障干劲冲天的钢铁战士的健康，使他们胜利地完成任务呢？
    最近我们在武汉钢铁公司调查了土法炼钢铁的劳动卫生情况，发现钢铁战士中，烫伤、外伤、感冒、喉痛、咳嗽等疾病比较多，其原因不外下列几点：
    第一，钢铁战士干劲大，热情高，但是炼钢还是个生手，对安全生产认识不足，只注意了要钢铁出得快和多，忽视了工伤事故。
    第二，炉群密集，工作面小而工具长，位置摆放不得法，以致被火花或工具烫伤或碰伤。
    第三，炉前的温度，与一般温度相差较大，剧烈劳动后，大汗淋漓，毛孔扩大，人体抵抗力降低，如果停下来休息的时候不加衣服，就容易伤风感冒。同时炉前温度高，辐射热极强，以致空气干燥，容易使人的咽喉和鼻腔粘膜感到干燥和疼痛。
    为了防止疾病与创伤的发生，在操作时应该建立安全操作规程制度，如配备安全帽、手套、鞋罩、有色眼镜等劳动保护品；工具粘上铁渣后，须先在水中冷却，然后捶掉。操作完毕，先把工具放在水中冷却，然后放平。工具和水桶应放在炉旁著目顺手的地方。燃料、原料和炼好的钢铁，不要放在交通要道和人群集中的地方。上料、休息和操作时应站在上风向的位置。
    炉群之间每行的距离，最少能放下工具。成排的炉群，应把炉门开设在同一方向。
    每炼完一次钢，应整理炉前一次和洒水一次，以维持炉前的整洁和湿度。
    劳动后外出时，应将衣服披上，做到吃好、睡好、休息好。
    设立急救包，意外创伤后，及时包扎处理，以免感染使创口恶化。
    此外，应合理分配每炉的工作人数及职务，安排好休息场所和禁止非操作人员在炉子周围停留。
