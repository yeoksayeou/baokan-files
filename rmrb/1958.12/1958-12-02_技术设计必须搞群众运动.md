    Technical Design Must Involve Mass Movements
    Jiang Zaiyu, Deputy Director of Beijing First Machine Tool Factory
    The Beijing First Machine Tool Factory has made some achievements in the technical revolution movement by mobilizing the masses to simplify the structure of machine tools. For example, after simplifying the structure of the ×62W universal milling machine, the number of parts was reduced by more than one-half (about 1,600 pieces), the weight was reduced by about half a ton from the original (three tons), and the electrical components were reduced by three-quarters from the original (557 pieces), while the performance of the machine tool remained basically unchanged.
    This year, our production and capital construction tasks have made great leaps forward. However, in terms of production, apart from a relatively high increase in the second quarter, the task was barely completed afterwards by increasing manpower, increasing equipment, increasing working hours, increasing labor intensity, and consuming a large amount of semi-finished products. This situation dragged on until the fourth quarter, and the problem gradually became serious. Mechanical processing and assembly must be doubled to complete the annual leap forward plan. It is impossible to continue to improve by relying solely on hard work. Among the middle-level leading cadres, a large number of comrades had lost confidence in completing the task and demanded a reduction in the task. In response to this situation, the Party committee promptly convened a meeting and launched a debate on the following two ideas: one was to reduce production to complete this year's task, and the other was to use technical revolution to complete the leap forward plan of 1,300 units. In order to liberate thinking and build confidence, a wide-ranging discussion was conducted. After discussion, it was believed that not a single unit of this year's task could be discounted, and the solution to the current problems of heavy production tasks, low efficiency, and material shortages was to carry out a technical revolution. It was determined that simplifying the structure of machine tools and improving processing technology, and vigorously developing indigenous equipment, would be the central content of the technical revolution. At the same time, it was affirmed that technical work was not only possible but also necessary to follow the mass line, and that technical authority must be delegated. After that, we focused prominently on simplifying the structure of machine tools as the goal of the machine tool factory's efforts.
    With leadership determination, on the one hand, organizational leadership was strengthened. Technical revolution committees were formed throughout the factory and in each workshop. The factory director, secretary, and workshop director served as chairmen of the committees at all levels, and some technical personnel and veteran workers were absorbed to participate. Five combat teams were established under the committees: the old product (universal milling machine) simplification combat team, the cold processing technology combat team, the hot processing technology combat team, the large machine tool simplification combat team, and the "ants gnawing at bones" combat team, etc.
    On the other hand, many concerns were dispelled, and "orthodox thinking" was abandoned. When the task of simplifying the structure was conveyed in the assembly section, the workers still had many concerns, fearing that the technical section would not approve it. Because in the past rationalization suggestion movement, workers had put forward some improvement opinions on the structure and electrical aspects of machine tools, but they were generally rejected by the technical sections, which held the power of technology, on the grounds of "finalized drawings" and "one-sided opinions." This is actually the ideology of belittling practice and believing in books at work. However, for veteran workers who have assembled this type of machine tool for five or six years, although they were unwilling to accept this unreasonable situation, they also developed some feelings of inferiority. In response to this phenomenon, the workshop leadership repeatedly mobilized, first within the Party and then outside the Party, explaining that workers are both manufacturers and users, and should also be designers. At the same time, the head of the technical section personally led the technical personnel down to ensure that everyone's reasonable opinions were accepted, and to ensure that actual modifications could be made before modifying the drawings. In this way, a vigorous mass movement to simplify the structure of machine tools arrived.
    In just three days and nights of fighting, the number of parts of the universal milling machine (3,352 pieces) was reduced by 1,624 pieces, a reduction of about one-half; about 400 kilograms of steel were saved, assembly man-hours were saved by 55%, and total manufacturing man-hours were saved by about one-third. Some people may doubt: has the performance of the machine tool been greatly reduced? The answer is: from the outside it looks almost exactly the same, the cutting performance and rigidity are also exactly the same, the shifting performance remains completely unchanged, and the accuracy of the machine tool has not been reduced. Therefore, the workers said that this time the "appendix" of the machine tool has been truly cut off. The problem of purchasing a large number of electrical parts has also been solved, and the difficulties in material supply and the insufficient processing capacity have all been readily solved. Therefore, middle-level cadres also began to have confidence in completing the leap forward plan.
    There have also been new gains in ideological aspects. The technical personnel's views on the workers have undergone new changes in the process of simplifying the structure. For example, in the simplification, regarding the stroke device of the worktable and the retention of motorized function after the simplification of the lifting table, the technical personnel believed that this part was complex and could not be improved. The veteran workers, however, believed that if you say it can't be done, I will make it work. The technical personnel who were working with them went to sleep, but they continued to study for more than 30 hours, and finally completed this new mechanism. In this case, the technical personnel had no reason not to admit the reality, and began to realize that theory must be combined with practice, and that much knowledge cannot be found in books at all. The workers' views on the technical personnel have also changed. They said that in the past when we made suggestions, you always researched them, but never saw any action. Technical issues were decided by you. This time it has really changed, and it is modified as soon as it is said. Some veteran workers have also been liberated from the circle of mental states such as inferiority, and replaced by a new ideology of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, daring to innovate, daring to break superstitions, boldly innovating, not being slaves to technology, but being the masters of technology. The profound significance and role of the three-way combination of leaders, technical personnel, and workers has also provided new experience in this work.
    Due to the leading role of the machine tool simplification work, the pace of the technical revolution movement in the entire factory has accelerated. The mold casting workshop has launched a movement to replace manual labor with mechanization and to focus on solving raw material difficulties, and the mechanical processing workshop has launched a movement to vigorously develop indigenous equipment.
    On this issue, we have the following three experiences:
    (1) Regarding factories launching mass movements. In the past, technical work, especially design work, was often not included in this category. From this experience, it seems that technical work is entirely possible and necessary to launch mass movements. This is a struggle between two lines and two methods. The new method breaks through the past practice of only relying on the system and only relying on a small number of technical personnel, without relying on the subjective initiative of "people," and without relying on the vast majority of the masses.
    (2) The great determination of the leadership is an important condition for achieving this success. When the output had to be doubled in the fourth quarter, the problem became serious, so we had to revolutionize. The reason why this improvement was so great and so fast is related to the poor conditions and heavy tasks. The leaders had to show the greatest determination to overcome these difficulties.
    (3) Clear goals and concentrated strength are also an experience in gaining gains. In the technical revolution movement in August, only general proposals were put forward, hundreds or thousands of proposals per person. More than 80,000 proposals were made in three days. The cadres were so busy that they were overwhelmed with complaints, shouting that the technical revolution was in conflict with current production. This time the goals were clear, and the results were significantly different.

    技术设计必须搞群众运动
    北京第一机床厂副厂长  姜载愉
    北京第一机床厂在技术革命运动中，发动群众简化机床构造的工作，已经作出了一定的成绩。如×62W万能铣床简化结构以后，零件数量减少了二分之一强（约一千六百件），重量比原来（三吨）减少约半吨，电器比原来（五百五十七件）减少四分之三，而机床性能基本未变。
    我们今年的生产和基建任务有了很大的跃进。但是生产方面除在第二季度初生产幅度有比较高的增长外，以后往往靠增人、增设备、增加工作时间、增加劳动强度和大量吃再制品等办法勉强地完成了任务。这种形势拖到了第四季度，问题渐渐严重了，机械加工和装配必须翻一番才能完成全年跃进计划，单凭苦干是不能继续提高的。在中层领导干部中，很大一部分同志已失去了完成任务的信心，要求削减任务。党委会针对这种情况及时地召开了会议，对以下两种思想展开了争论：一种是减少产量以完成今年任务，一种是用技术革命的手段来完成一千三百台的跃进计划。为了解放思想，树立信心，曾进行了一次广泛的讨论。经过讨论，认为今年任务一台不能打折扣，而解决当前生产上任务重、效率低、材料缺等问题的办法是开展技术革命。并确定以精简机床结构和改进加工工艺，大搞土设备为技术革命的中心内容。同时肯定技术工作不但可能而且必须走群众路线，技术大权必须下放。此后，我们就突出地抓住简化机床结构这一环节作为机床厂努力的目标。
    领导有了决心，一方面加强了组织领导，全厂和各车间都组成技术革命委员会，厂长、书记、车间主任分别担任各级委员会的主任委员，并吸收部分技术人员和老工人参加，委员会下面又成立有五个战斗队：即老产品（万能铣床）精简战斗队，冷加工工艺战斗队，热加工工艺战斗队，大型机床简化战斗队，蚂蚁啃骨头战斗队等。
    另一方面解除了重重顾虑，丢掉了“正规思想”。当精简结构的任务在装配工段进行传达时，工人仍有不少顾虑，怕技术科室这一关通不过。因为工人在以往合理化建议运动中曾提出过部分关于机床结构及电器方面的改进意见，但一般地被掌握技术大权的技术科室以“定型图纸”“意见片面”等理由加以拒绝。这实际上是轻视实践，迷信书本的思想在作怪。但是对于装配了五六年这种机床的老工人来说，他们虽然不甘心于这种不合理状况，却也产生了一些自卑感。针对这种现象，车间领导上以先党内后党外的方法反复动员，说明工人既是制造者和使用者，又应该是设计者，同时技术科长也亲自带领技术人员下去，保证接受大家合理的意见，保证可以先改实际后改图纸。这样一来一个蓬蓬勃勃的精简机床结构的群众运动高潮到来了。
    仅仅经过了三天日夜战斗，万能铣床零件（三千三百五十二件）减少了一千六百二十四件，减少了约二分之一；节约钢材约四百公斤，节省装配工时55％，全部制造工时节省了约三分之一。也许有人会怀疑：机床性能是大大降低了吧？回答是：从外形看几乎完全一样，切削性能和刚性也完全一样，变速性能完全不变，机床精度并未降低。因此工人们说，这回真正的割掉了机床的“盲肠”了。大批电器零件购买困难的问题也得到了解决，材料供应中的困难，加工工作能力不足问题，都迎刃而解了。因此中层干部也开始对完成跃进计划有了信心。
    在思想方面也有新的收获，技术人员对工人的看法在简化结构过程中有了新的变化。如在简化中关于工作台行程装置和升降台简化后机动保留等二项，技术人员认为这部分复杂，无法改进。老工人却认为你说不行我非让他行不可。配合他们工作的技术人员都睡觉了，他们却继续研究了三十多小时，终于完成了这个新的机构。在这种情况下技术人员再也没有理由不承认现实了，开始体会了理论必须结合实际，而且很多知识书本上根本找不到。工人对技术人员的看法，也发生新的变化。他们说过去我们提意见，你们总是研究研究，而从未见诸行动，技术问题是你们说了算，这回真的变了，说改就改。部分老工人也从自卑感等精神状态的圈子里解放出来，而代之以敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为、敢于破除迷信，大胆革新，不做技术的奴隶，要做技术的主人的新思想。领导、技术人员、工人三结合的深刻意义与作用，在这件工作中也提供了新的经验。
    由于机床简化工作的带头，全厂技术革命运动开展的速度加快了，模铸车间以机械化代替手工劳动和以解决原材料困难为中心的运动，机械加工车间大搞土设备的运动都纷纷开展起来了。
    在这个问题上，我们有以下三点体会：
    （1）关于工厂大搞群众运动。过去技术工作，特别是设计工作往往是不在此例。从这次的经验看来，技术工作完全可能而且必须搞群众运动。这是两条道路，两种方法的斗争。新的方法冲破了过去只依靠制度，只依靠少数技术人员的作法，而不依靠“人”的主观能动性，不依靠绝大多数的群众。
    （2）领导决心大，是这次取得成绩的重要条件。到四季度产量要翻一番，问题严重了，只好革命，这次所以改进得这么多这么快，是与条件差、任务重有关的，领导不得不拿出最大的决心来，克服这些困难。
    （3）目标明确力量集中，也是取得收获的一条经验。在8月份的技术革命运动中只泛泛地提出多提建议，一人几百条几千条，三天内提了八万多条，干部忙的不可开交，怨声载道，大叫技术革命对当前生产有矛盾。这回目标明确，效果就显著不同了。
