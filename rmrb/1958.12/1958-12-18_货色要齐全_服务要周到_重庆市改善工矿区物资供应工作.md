Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 17th: Chongqing's commercial departments are improving the material supply work in industrial and mining areas. Municipal and district commercial departments are, on the one hand, helping large factories and mines to directly link up with rural people's communes, so that the non-staple foods needed by factories and mines can be supplied nearby; on the other hand, they are sending a large number of purchasing personnel to nearby counties to make purchases. The Chongqing Department Store Wholesale Station has increased the supply of popular goods beyond the original supply plan, including more than 140,000 pairs of rubber shoes and more than 16,000 dozens of woolen shirts and trousers, to supply major industrial and mining areas.

Now, the variety of goods in department stores, trading companies, and cultural goods stores in various industrial and mining areas is greater than in urban areas, and the shelves are filled with a dazzling array of winter supplies.

    重庆市改善工矿区物资供应工作
    据新华社重庆17日电  重庆市商业部门改善工矿区的物资供应工作。市、区商业部门一面帮助大型厂矿直接与农村人民公社挂钩，使厂矿需要的副食品能够就近得到供应；一面派出大批采购人员到附近各县去采购。重庆百货批发站在原供应计划以外，增加了畅销商品胶鞋十四万多双，绒衫、绒裤一万六千多打，供应主要工矿区。
    现在，各工矿区的百货、贸易、文化用品商店里的商品花色品种比城区要多，货架上陈列的冬季用品琳琅满目。
