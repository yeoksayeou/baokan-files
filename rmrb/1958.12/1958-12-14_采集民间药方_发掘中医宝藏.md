Collect Folk Prescriptions and Excavate the Treasure of Traditional Chinese Medicine

Our country's medicine is a great treasure house. In order to inherit and carry forward the motherland's medical heritage, the Party Central Committee clearly pointed out as early as 1954 that traditional Chinese medicine has a long history in our country and is an extremely rich accumulation of the experiences of our people in fighting against diseases for thousands of years. It has made great contributions to the survival and development of our nation and should be vigorously explored and improved. In the past few years, in order to implement this instruction of the Party Central Committee, Party committees at all levels in various regions have not only organized Western medicine practitioners to study the theoretical knowledge and clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine, but also actively launched the work of collecting folk single remedies, secret recipes, effective prescriptions, and medical techniques, and have achieved considerable results. For example, Fujian Province has collected more than 700,000 various prescriptions, and Hebei Province has collected more than 160,000 items. Hebei Province has compiled and printed "Ten Thousand Brocade Prescriptions" from the collected prescriptions, and various special districts and counties have also printed the collected prescriptions. The province is also establishing a traditional Chinese medicine research network to identify and test newly discovered prescriptions and actively disseminate them. This work is necessary to further explore the science of traditional Chinese medicine and make it better serve the people's health and the cause of socialist construction. However, the single remedies, secret recipes, effective prescriptions, and various medical techniques in our country are as vast as the sea and extremely rich. What has been collected is only a small part of it. To collect, research, and organize them bit by bit is still an arduous historical task. We must mobilize the masses to carry out a mass collection of folk prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine like the folk song collection work.

The value of folk single remedies, secret recipes, effective prescriptions, and medical techniques lies in the fact that they are the accumulated experiences of the vast number of people in fighting against diseases for thousands of years. They are the treasures of traditional Chinese medicine. Some of these treasures have been written into traditional Chinese medicine books of past dynasties, but a large part of them are still circulating among the people and must be well excavated, researched, and organized. Those national nihilists who have been deeply influenced by the slavish ideology of imperialism ignore the facts and want to negate all these treasures of the motherland. Some people are influenced by Western medical viewpoints and use the framework of Western medicine to judge traditional Chinese medicine, saying that these indigenous prescriptions and techniques are unscientific. This is also unfounded. Science comes from practice, and practice is the mother of science. Folk indigenous prescriptions and techniques are the product of the long-term practice of the vast number of people in fighting against diseases. Their most valuable aspect is that they have been developed through repeated practice and improvement, and then further practice and further improvement by the vast number of people. They are often effective for many diseases, including difficult and complicated diseases. Due to the limitations of modern science, we have not yet been able to clearly explain the reason behind these valuable experiences. Therefore, saying that they are unscientific is, first of all, an unscientific attitude. From the facts before us, traditional Chinese medicine has begun to shine in the upsurge of technological revolution. A large number of facts show that traditional Chinese medicine can not only treat diseases currently treated by Western medicine, but also treat many diseases that are difficult for Western medicine to treat. Some difficult and complicated diseases that are difficult for Western medicine to treat, traditional Chinese medicine has long had treatment methods. For example, traditional Chinese medicine is far more effective than Western medicine in treating diseases such as type B encephalitis, chronic nephritis, bone tuberculosis, cancer, color blindness, deafness and muteness, cirrhosis, and infantile paralysis. Moreover, Mr. Sheng Zizhang, an old Chinese medicine doctor in Longhua County, Hebei Province, contributed his ancestral secret recipe for treating syphilis, "Three Immortal Pills" and "Blood Cleansing and Detoxifying Pills." The province promoted this secret recipe, and within a few dozen days, it eliminated the existing cases of syphilis in the entire province. This has to be said to be a miracle! More and more cases of using single remedies to cure serious diseases and bring the dead back to life are being discovered. Moreover, these folk single remedies, secret recipes, effective prescriptions, and treatment techniques have a common characteristic, that is, they are simple, easy to implement, economical, and convenient to promote, in line with the spirit of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. As the Central Committee pointed out, this is a major event that concerns the health of the broad masses of people and the socialist construction of the country and should not be taken lightly.

From the perspective of medical research, many folk prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine contain many undiscovered theories and laws, which have great scientific value, provide a direction for the exploration of traditional Chinese medicine scientific research work, and provide rich information. Mastering these materials in large quantities and the classic works of medical scientists of past dynasties provides the conditions for creating our country's new medicine.

While solving the incorrect understanding of traditional Chinese medicine among health workers, it is also necessary to publicize and implement the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy among the masses in order to quickly launch the folk prescription collection work. After the national rectification movement, especially after the people's commune movement, the socialist awareness of the broad masses of people has been unprecedentedly raised. Most of the people who have prescriptions and treatment techniques preserved among the people actively contribute them to make them play a greater role. However, due to the influence of old ideas, a few Chinese medicine practitioners still keep secret recipes and medical techniques secret. Some people do not rely on practicing medicine to maintain their livelihoods, but because they are afraid of trouble and delaying production, they do not actively contribute prescriptions and techniques. Therefore, in order to mobilize them all to consciously and voluntarily disclose various prescriptions and medical techniques, in addition to conducting general political and ideological education, it is also necessary to publicize the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy. Hebei Province has created valuable experience in this regard. They have made the masses deeply aware of the benefits of contributing prescriptions and treasures to the country and the people through seeking and visiting talents and some seminars. In the work, for some people who are temporarily unwilling to contribute treasures, we must carefully understand their ideological situation and patiently persuade and educate them. When necessary, we should also wait for them to raise their awareness. It is wrong to adopt coercive orders or simple and hasty methods for these people, because this will not only not be conducive to the work of collecting folk prescriptions, but will hinder the development of this collection work.

In the process of implementing and publicizing the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy and carrying out the collection work, some specific problems should be dealt with in a timely manner. Anyone who contributes secret recipes and medical expertise should receive appropriate political and material encouragement from local people's governments based on their contributions to the cause of socialist construction. Among them, some people with important expertise should also have their knowledge and technology organized and disseminated in a timely manner. For some people, they should also be allowed to participate in relevant important research work. These measures are a great encouragement to the people who contribute prescriptions and are also of educational significance to the broad masses of people. In the past, all places that have taken these measures have been conducive to the development of this collection work.

In order to ensure that this work is gradually carried out in depth, it is very important to promptly process the collected prescriptions on the premise of comprehensive excavation and comprehensive reception. It is necessary to organize manpower to classify and organize these folk prescriptions and conduct research and identification. Because these prescriptions are all specifically for treating one disease, and the reasons for people's illnesses are different, the severity is different, and the specific circumstances of the patients are different, so the medicine used and the amount of medicine used are also different. Some prescriptions have been secretly passed down for several generations, and there may be inaccuracies, errors, or misrepresentations. Some prescriptions treat severe diseases and are very toxic. If taken incorrectly, they will harm people's lives. There are also some prescriptions that are not completely reasonable or scientific in themselves; some prescriptions have no practical effect, and some even contain certain harmful superstitious elements. It is not appropriate to promote them on a large scale without research, organization, and actual verification. We must first promote the effective prescriptions that have been tested, and at the same time conduct research to remove the crude and retain the essence and remove the false and retain the true for other prescriptions. This is a responsible and serious attitude for promotion. Doing this work in a timely manner and doing it well can consolidate and improve the morale of the masses, and can also play a role in supporting construction immediately. The method of "collecting, organizing, researching, and promoting simultaneously" in Hebei Province is very good. They also classify and organize some effective prescriptions into books and let the broad masses of people verify them in the promotion process, which is also very necessary.

It is hoped that all localities will attach importance to this work so that the medicine of the motherland will shine even brighter soon.

    采集民间药方  发掘中医宝藏
    我国医学是一个伟大的宝库。党中央为了继承和发扬祖国的医学遗产，早在1954年就明确的指出，中医中药在我国有悠久的历史，是我国人民几千年来同疾病作斗争的极为丰富的经验的积累，对于我国民族的生存和发展有着巨大的贡献，应当努力发掘，加以提高。几年来，各地各级党委为了贯彻党中央的这一指示，在组织西医学习中医理论知识和临床经验的同时，还积极展开了收集民间单方、秘方、验方和医疗技术的工作。并已取得了不少成绩。成绩较显著的如福建省已收集各种药方达七十多万件，河北省已收集了十六万多件。河北省已将所收集的药方汇总分类整理刊印“十万锦方”，各专、县也纷纷将所收集的药方刊印，全省并正在建立中医中药研究网，对新发现的药方进行鉴定和试验，积极传播。这些工作是进一步发掘祖国医学科学、使它更好地为人民健康和社会主义建设事业服务，这是十分需要的。但是，我国民间的单方、秘方、验方和各种医疗技术浩如渊海，极其丰富，已收集的只不过是其中很小一部分，要一点一滴地把它全部收集起来加以研究整理，还是一个艰巨的历史任务，必须发动广大群众像搜集民歌的采风工作那样，进行群众性的搜集中医民间药方的采风工作。
    民间的单方、秘方、验方和医疗技术之所以有价值，就是在于它们都是几千年来广大人民与疾病作斗争的经验积累。它们是祖国医学中的珍宝。对于这些珍宝，中国历代的中医中药书籍写进了一部分，但是很大部分还流传在民间，必须很好地把它挖掘出来加以研究整理。那些深受帝国主义奴化思想影响的民族虚无主义者，他们无视事实，想把祖国这些珍宝一概加以否定。有些人受到西方医学观点的影响，用西医的框框来套中医，说这些土药方土技术不科学，这也是没有根据的。科学来自实践，实践是科学之母，民间的土药方和土技术是广大人民长期与疾病作斗争的实践的产物，它们最可贵的就是曾经经过广大人民的反复实践和提高、再实践和再提高而发展起来的，它们对于很多疾病，包括疑难病症在内也是常奏奇效的。对于这些宝贵的经验，由于现代科学的局限性，还没能把它的所以然的道理解说清楚。因之，说它不科学，这种态度首先就是不科学的。从我们眼前的事实来看，中医在技术革命热潮中已经开始大放异彩，大量的事实表明，中医中药不但能够治疗目前西医所治疗的疾病，而且能够治疗许多西医所难以治疗的疾病。有些西医难以治疗的疑难病症，中医早已有了治疗的办法。如乙型脑炎、慢性肾炎、骨结核、癌瘤、色盲、聋哑、肝硬变、小儿麻痹等等病症，中医的疗效远远超过西医。而如河北省隆化县中医盛子章老先生献出他祖传的治疗梅毒秘方“三仙丹”和“清血搜毒丸”，全省推广这一秘方，几十天内即消灭了全省的现症梅毒，这不能不说是奇迹！各地使用一些单方治好大病，起死回生的事例，越搜寻越多。而且，这些民间的单方、秘方、验方和治疗技术，有个共同的特色，就是简单易行，经济方便，便于推广，符合多快好省的精神。对于这一关系广大人民健康和国家社会主义建设的大事情，正如中央指出的：不可等闲视之。
    从医学研究工作来说，很多中医民间药方蕴藏有很多尚未被发现的理论和规律，具有很大的科学价值，为祖国医学科学研究工作提出了探索的方向，并提供了丰富的资料。大量地掌握这些资料和历代医学家的经典著作，就有条件创造出我国的新医学。
    在卫生工作人员中解决对中医中药不正确认识的同时，还要把党的中医工作政策宣传贯彻到群众中去，才能迅速地展开搜集中医民间药方的采风工作。经过全民整风运动，特别是经过人民公社化运动以后，广大人民的社会主义觉悟空前提高，民间保存有药方和治疗技术的，大部分人都积极地把它们贡献出来，使它发挥更大的效果。但是由于旧思想的影响，有少数中医迄今仍把秘方和医疗技术秘而不宣。有的人虽不靠行医维持生活，但由于怕麻烦、怕耽误生产，也不积极献出药方和技术。因之，要把他们都发动起来，自觉自愿地把各种药方和医疗技术公开出来，除去要进行一般的政治思想教育以外，还必须宣传党的中医政策。河北省在这方面就创造了宝贵的经验。他们通过求贤访贤，和一些座谈会，使群众深刻认识到献方献宝对国家和人民的好处。在工作中对某些一时还不愿意献宝的人，要细心了解他们的思想情况，要耐心加以说服教育，在必要时还应当等待他们提高觉悟，对这些人采取强迫命令或者简单急躁的办法，都是错误的，因为这样，不只不会有利于搜集民间药方的工作，而反会阻碍这一搜集工作的开展。
    在贯彻宣传党的中医政策，开展采风的过程中，要及时处理一些具体问题。凡是献出秘方和医疗特技的人，根据他们对社会主义建设事业的贡献，应该得到各地人民政府在政治上物质上的适当鼓励。其中有些有重要专长的人，还应当使他的知识、技术及时组织传播。对某些人，还要使他参加有关的重要的研究工作。这些措施对献方的人是个很大的鼓舞，对广大人民也有教育意义。过去凡是采取这些措施的地方，都有利于这一采风工作的开展。
    为保证这一工作逐步深入地展开，在全面挖掘、全面接收的前提下，及时处理已搜集的药方，是一项很重要的工作。必须组织人力把这些民间药方分门别类地加以整理，并进行研究和鉴定。因为这些药方都是专治一病的，而人们起病的原因不同，轻重不同，病人的各种具体情况不同，因此用药和用药的分量也不同。有的药方经几代秘传，可能有失实或错漏、或者以讹传讹的地方。有的药方治烈性疾病，毒性很大，错服了就会伤人性命。还有某些药方，本身还有不尽合理、不尽科学之处；有的药方并无实际疗效，甚至有的还夹杂了某些有害的迷信成份。如果不经过研究整理和实际验证，就大事推广，是不妥当的。我们必须一边把试用有效的药方先行推广，同时对另一些药方，进行去粗存精和去伪存真的研究工作，才是负责到底认真推广的态度。这一工作做得及时，做得好，可以巩固和提高群众的情绪，也可以立竿见影地发挥这些药方支援建设的作用。河北省进行“边搜集、边整理、边研究、边推广”的方法是很好的，他们还把一些有效的药方分类整理刊印成册，让广大群众在推广中去加以验证，也是很必要的。
    希望各地重视这一工作，让祖国的医学早日放出更大的光彩。
