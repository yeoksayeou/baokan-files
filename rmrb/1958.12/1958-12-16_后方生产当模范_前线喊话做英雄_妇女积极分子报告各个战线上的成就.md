Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: The National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference continued its plenary session today.

In today's plenary session, three representatives from mountainous areas reported on their heroic deeds in building the mountains. Wu Sanmei, a Jiangxi Province cadre sent to the countryside in response to the Party's call to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, said in her speech that when they were assigned to the Jinggang Mountains to build the nation's first revolutionary base established by the Party and Chairman Mao himself, they felt extremely happy and fortunate. The female comrades on the mountain are all dedicated to building the mountainous areas, saying that they want to "be red in Jinggang, specialized in Jinggang, and build Jinggang for a lifetime." Wu Sanmei said that when they first arrived on the mountain, it was covered with ice and snow. They worked with the male comrades to break the ice, sweep away the snow, burn brambles, and reclaim wasteland. They also built their own threshing grounds and dormitories. Now, the face of Jinggang Mountain is changing with each passing day. The 110-kilometer-long Jinggang Mountain Road is now open to traffic. Cement factories, brick factories, wineries, paper mills, hydroelectric power stations, shops, libraries, etc., have all been established on the mountain. Daliang Mountain in Haiyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is a dry loess mountain with an altitude of 1,900 meters above sea level. The soil on the mountain is loose, and over the years, rain erosion has caused severe soil erosion, often damaging crops. This year, thirteen young women and seven young men from the Red Flag People's Commune in this county responded to the Party's call and formed a capital construction team. After seventy days of hard work, they created more than 3,000 mu of various forests, turning this gully-filled loess mountain into layers of neat terraced fields and rows of trees. They were awarded a banner by the National Third Soil and Water Conservation Conference. Fa Lanying, the captain of this capital construction team, introduced their experience in controlling Daliang Mountain at today's conference. Long Fenglian, a Dong ethnic woman from Xiaokou Township, Jinping County, Guizhou Province, a place of high mountains, deep valleys, and dense forests, talked about how the 42 women in their township formed a forestry commando team and afforested 6,824 mu in 40 days, with a 100% survival rate. Long Fenglian also led more than 200 women to plant corn, soybeans, wheat, and other crops on the mountain, achieving a double harvest of forestry and grain.

Zhang Lizhen, a female worker from the fine yarn workshop of the Chongqing No. 611 Yarn Factory, boldly improved the advanced operating method of yarn joining that had been widely promoted throughout the country, thus eliminating white spots and solving the long-standing problem of knots in fine yarn joining. As a result of creating such advanced experience, she was admitted as a member of the Chinese Textile Engineering Society. Today, this advanced female worker spoke at the conference. Also speaking at the conference was a model figure in rural women running industry. She is Fan Xiuying, director of the Yuejin People's Commune in Taihe County, Anhui Province. She took the lead in trial-producing bearings and ball bearings, and invented and successfully created twelve types of twenty-two large-scale tools. She also trained nineteen women to learn how to manufacture all ball bearings, and established the "Women's Red Flag Bearing Factory," making this commune the first bearing-ized unit in the county. Visiting groups from several provinces have come to their place to learn the experience of making bearings with indigenous methods.

"Stinky People's Street" becomes "Four-No Street." Li Daoying, a 63-year-old model from Hefei City, Anhui Province, spoke at the conference with this interesting title. Before liberation, Li Daoying begged for food for seven years and was a child bride for thirteen years. After liberation, she was continuously awarded the title of health model, work model, and advanced worker at the provincial, municipal, and district levels forty-two times. Miaohou Street, where she lives, used to be a famous "Stinky People's Street," where mosquitoes and flies met, garbage piled up, dirty water overflowed, and the stench was unbearable. Many people living in this area suffered from illnesses and sores. Since 1952, Li Daoying has been promoting sanitation work among the masses. During the high tide of eliminating the four pests this year, she mobilized the masses day and night to eliminate the four pests. In the beginning, the masses did not have the habit of eliminating the four pests and were afraid of trouble, satirizing her for meddling in other people's affairs after eating her fill. But she never lost heart. She always took the initiative to do things herself and set an example to motivate the masses. Now, every household in this area is tidied up in an orderly manner. Not a single spider web can be found on the walls or under the beds, and the clothes and quilts are washed clean, turning it into a "Four-No Street." In recent years, epidemic infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid, and dysentery have been basically eliminated. Cao Yixiu, a famous Dai ethnic rat-catching expert, has caught more than 10,000 rats from 1951 to the present. Today, she gave a detailed introduction to her eight years of rat-catching experience at the conference. Zhang Xiuying, a special-class health model from Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, introduced the situation of mobilizing the masses to carry out the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests under the leadership of the Party.

Chen Feifei, a female broadcaster from the enemy broadcasting station of the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front, reported to everyone at the conference how they bravely persisted in the struggle against the enemy in this position. Chen Feifei said: For more than three years, the five female comrades and male comrades of our front broadcasting station have carried out a tenacious struggle against the enemy. Through wired broadcasting, we directly transmitted the magnificent voice of the motherland across the sea to the enemy-occupied islands. This weapon, like a bomb, is a heavy blow to the enemy's spirit. Chen Feifei and the other four people often work and live in a small bunker only six meters long and four meters wide, and often persist in their work under the enemy's artillery fire. Sometimes the enemy's shrapnel breaks their wires and smashes their loudspeakers, but they always repair them quickly and immediately continue broadcasting. Over the years, their broadcasting station has continuously publicized to the enemy the great leap forward of socialism and the happy life of the people in the motherland, exposed the enemy's conspiracies, announced our army's determination to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, clarified the Party and government's various policies, and pointed out that the only way out for the Chiang Kai-shek troops is to abandon the darkness and turn to the light and return to the motherland. Therefore, many Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers have been moved by their appeals and have risked their lives to defect across the sea.

A total of eighteen people spoke at the conference today. Among them were: Zhu Huaqiu, deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Xinfeng People's Commune in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, who set an example in transforming backward societies, in flood control struggles, in learning farming techniques, and in the great battle for steel; Yang Qianzhi, assistant researcher at the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who led a team to successfully design the first factory in the country to produce rare earth elements (including fifteen rare metals); Jun Yue'e, a tracer at the Baotou Iron and Steel Company Design Institute, who created the record of drawing one drawing in four hours and achieving a 98% first-class product rate; Wang Ping, a health worker at the Yuzhong County Health Center in Gansu Province, who has delivered 310 babies with new methods in the past six years without any medical accidents; Peng Xiaohui, director of the Beijing Dafosi Kindergarten, a banner of self-reliance and thrift in running kindergartens; Sun Jie, manager of the Dahua Maternity and Infant Hostel in Xuanwu District, Beijing; Liu Huaxian, director of the chicken farm of the Chengjiao People's Commune in Taoyuan County, Hunan Province; Sun Xiangping, a model of "four fulls" (full breeding, full conception, full calving, and full survival) of draft cattle in Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province; and Zha Haxim, a cook at the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Farm in Tibet.

The conference will continue on the 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: During the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference, the representatives attending the conference widely participated in meetings, seminars, visits, and other activities in the capital.

As of today, 23 units, including the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Food, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the PLA troops stationed in Beijing, have invited representatives from relevant fields to hold seminars or get-togethers and asked them to share their experiences. The heads of these units met with the representatives and encouraged them to continue their efforts and add to their achievements.

Women from central government agencies and all walks of life in Beijing also invited the representatives to give reports. From the 5th to the 15th, more than 140,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing alone listened to the reports. Among the representatives who gave reports were nursery workers, cooks, salespersons, breeders, mail carriers, "bumper harvest girls," "steel girls," female generals, female county heads, and female poets. Their reports were warmly welcomed by the women, and their advanced deeds inspired the women's revolutionary enthusiasm.

    后方生产当模范  前线喊话做英雄
    妇女积极分子报告各个战线上的成就
    据新华社15日讯  全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议今日继续大会发言。
    在今天的大会发言中，有三位从山区来的代表报告了她们建设山区的战斗事迹。响应党的上山下乡号召来到井冈山的江西省下放干部吴三妹在发言中说，当她们被分配到井冈山来建设党和毛主席亲手创立的全国第一个革命根据地时，感到无比的快乐和幸福。山上的女同志都很安心建设山区，她们说，要“红在井冈，专在井冈，一辈子建设井冈”。吴三妹说，她们初上山时满山都是冰雪，她们和男同志一起捶碎冰，扫积雪，烧荆棘，开荒地，又自己动手建筑起场房和宿舍。现在，井冈山的面貌正在日新月异。长达一百一十公里的井冈山公路已经通车，水泥厂、砖瓦厂、造酒厂、造纸厂、水电站、商店、图书馆等等都在山上建立起来了。宁夏回族自治区海原县境内的大梁山是一座拔海一千九百公尺的黄土干山。山上土质疏松，历年来雨水冲刷，水土流失严重，庄稼时常受到损害。今年，这个县红旗人民公社的十三名女青年和七名男青年，响应党的号召，组成了一支基建队，经过七十天的苦战，营造各种树林三千多亩，使这座沟壑纵横的黄土山上出现了一层层整齐的梯田和一行行的树木，他们曾获得全国第三次水土保持会议奖给的一面锦旗。这个基建队的队长法兰英在今天的大会上介绍了她们治理大梁山的经过。来自山高谷深、森林丛生的贵州锦屏县小口乡的侗族妇女龙凤莲在发言里谈到，她们乡的四十二个妇女组成了一支造林突击队，在四十天内造林六千八百二十四亩，这些树百分之百都成活了。龙凤莲还曾经领导过二百多名妇女在山上种了玉米、黄豆、小麦等作物，获得了林粮双丰收。
    大胆地改进了全国曾经普遍推广的解拈接头的先进操作法，因而消灭了白点，解决了长期不能解决的细纱接头有疙瘩的问题，重庆市六一一纱厂细纱车间女工张利珍由于创造了这样的先进经验而被吸收为中国纺织工程学会会员。今天，这位先进女工在会上发了言。在会上发言的还有一位农村妇女办工业的模范人物。她是安徽省太和县跃进人民公社主任范秀英。她带头试制轴承和滚珠，发明创造成功十二种二十二件大型工具，并且训练出十九名妇女学会制造全部滚珠轴承，办起了“妇女红旗轴承厂”，使这个社成为全县第一个轴承化的单位，好几个省的参观团都到她们那里去学习土法制轴承的经验。
    “臭人街”变为“四无街”，安徽省合肥市六十三岁的老模范李道英以这个引人兴趣的题目在会上发言。解放前，李道英讨过七年饭，当过十三年童养媳，而解放后她连续被评为四十二次省、市、区的卫生模范、工作模范和先进工作者。她所在的庙后街过去是有名的“臭人街”，蚊蝇碰面，垃圾成堆，脏水四溢、臭气熏人，居住在这个地区的人生病害疮的很多。1952年以来，李道英就在群众中宣传卫生工作，今年除四害高潮中，她更是日日夜夜发动群众除四害。开始时群众没有除四害的习惯，怕麻烦，讽刺她是吃了饭管闲事。但她始终不灰心，她处处亲自动手，做出榜样带动群众。现在这个地区家家户户都收拾得有条有理，墙上床下找不到一丝蜘蛛网子，衣服被子都洗得清清爽爽，变成了“四无街”，几年来已基本上消灭了疟疾、伤寒、痢疾等流行性传染病。著名的傣族捕鼠能手曹依秀，从1951年到现在共捕鼠一万多只，今天她在会上详细地介绍了八年来的捕鼠经验。江苏省南京市的特等卫生模范张秀英介绍了她在党的领导下发动群众开展除四害讲卫生运动的情况。
    解放军福建前线部队对敌广播站的一位女广播员陈斐斐在会上向大家报告了她们是怎样在这个岗位上英勇坚持对敌斗争的。陈斐斐说：三年多来，我们前线广播站的五个女同志和男同志在一起对敌进行了顽强的斗争，通过有线广播直接将祖国宏伟的声音越过海洋传送到敌占岛屿上去，这个武器如同炸弹一样，对敌人精神上是一种沉重的打击。陈斐斐等五个人经常工作和生活在一个只有六公尺长、四公尺宽的狭小的地堡里，常常在敌人的炮火下坚持工作，有时敌人的炮弹片打断了他们的电线，打碎了喇叭，他们总是很快就抢修好，马上继续喊话。几年来，他们的广播站不断向敌人宣传祖国社会主义大跃进和人民幸福生活的情况，揭露敌人阴谋活动，宣布我军解放台澎金马的决心，阐明党和政府的各项政策，指出蒋军弃暗投明回到祖国是唯一出路，因此，有不少蒋军官兵被他们的喊话所感动，冒着生命危险越海投诚过来。
    今天在会上发言的共有十八人。她们之中还有：在改造落后社的工作中、在防洪斗争中、在学习耕作技术中、在大战钢铁中处处以身作则的浙江省富阳县新枫人民公社党支部副书记朱花球，领导一个小组为全国第一个生产稀土元素（包括十五种稀有金属）的工厂进行了成功的设计的中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所助理研究员杨倩志，创造四小时描一张图、一级品达到98％的包头钢铁公司设计院的描图员郡月娥，六年来用新法接生三百一十人从未发生医疗事故的甘肃省榆中县卫生院保健员王萍，自力更生勤俭办园的旗帜——北京大佛寺幼儿园园长彭筱惠，北京市宣武区大华妇婴旅社经理孙洁，湖南省桃源县城郊人民公社养鸡场场长刘华仙，江苏省盱眙县耕牛“四全”（全配种、全受孕、全产仔、全成活）模范孙相平，西藏拉萨农业试验场炊事员扎哈西姆。
    16日，大会将继续举行。
    据新华社15日讯  在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议期间，出席会议的代表在首都广泛参加了会见、座谈、访问等活动。
    到今天为止，已有文化部、卫生部、轻工业部、农垦部、财政部、内务部、粮食部、全国总工会、中国人民解放军驻京部队等二十三个单位分别邀请有关方面的代表举行了座谈会或联欢会，并且请她们介绍经验。这些单位的负责人都接见了代表，鼓励她们继续努力，功上加功。
    中央机关和北京市各界妇女还邀请代表们作报告。从5日到15日止，仅北京市各界就有十四万多人听了报告。在作报告的代表中，有保育员、炊事员、售货员、饲养员、邮递员、“丰产姑娘”、“钢铁姑娘”、女将军、女县长、女诗人等。她们的报告受到妇女们的热烈欢迎，她们的先进事迹，鼓舞了妇女们的革命干劲。
