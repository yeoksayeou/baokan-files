(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reports: In recent days, fierce battles have erupted in many areas between the Cuban rebel army and government forces.

The Batista dictatorship, supplied with a large amount of military hardware and weapons by imperialism, recently launched a so-called "decisive" offensive against the Cuban rebel army. In order to prevent the victorious development of the Cuban rebel army, Batista has transferred a large number of reinforcements, organized "new combat battalions," and used aircraft and fast ships in this operation.

Fierce fighting has mainly occurred in the three provinces of Oriente, Las Villas, and Camagüey in eastern Cuba. The fighting has been particularly intense around Santiago in Oriente province, which is surrounded by the rebel army, and near the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo in the same province. The government forces have dispatched air force units every day, not only bombing the rebel army's positions but also indiscriminately bombing residential areas in the combat zone. However, Batista's offensive has met with stubborn resistance from the rebel army. In Oriente province, the rebel army's pressure on Santiago is increasing. Not only have the government forces been unable to break through the six-mile radius encirclement laid down by the rebel army, but they were also forced to withdraw from a town only four miles from the city on the 21st. At the same time, the Cuban rebel army occupied a town called Sevilla near Guantanamo, capturing nineteen government soldiers and seizing a large number of weapons.

In Las Villas province, after capturing twelve towns, the Cuban rebel army has completely surrounded Santa Clara, the provincial capital. The telecommunications link between Santa Clara and Havana was cut off on the evening of the 25th. At the same time, it is reported that the rebel army is establishing local people's governments near the towns it has already captured.

The new victories achieved by the rebel army have infuriated the dictator Batista. The dictatorship's army received a military order on the 26th, demanding that government forces indiscriminately bomb the rebel army and the people in the areas occupied by the rebel army by any means from the 26th onward. At the same time, government forces are stepping up reinforcements to Las Villas province.

Commenting on Batista's so-called "decisive" offensive, even U.S. newspapers have had to admit that Batista will end in failure.

With the Cuban rebel army scoring many successive victories and the Batista dictatorial rule becoming increasingly unstable, the United States is conspiring to use the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs.

An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 26th revealed that the United States has recently instigated some Latin American countries to discuss how to intervene in Cuba's internal affairs. The news agency said that this secret meeting "has been going on for several weeks" and that "the United States has also participated in the discussion of the Cuban situation." An editorial published in the Argentine "Times" on the 10th stated that "as the climax of the armed struggle of Cuban patriots forces (Cuban dictator) Batista into an impasse, Washington is stepping up its conspiratorial activities to save the Batista elements by interfering in Cuba's internal affairs through the Organization of American States."

The newspaper pointed out that "The New York Times" had said in its editorial on the 9th: "The only glimmer of hope now lies in the intervention of the Organization of American States."

    粉碎巴蒂斯塔的疯狂进攻
    古巴起义军各线告捷
    美国阴谋用美洲国家组织干涉古巴内政
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息：最近几天古巴起义军同政府军之间在许多地区展开了激烈的战斗。
    得到帝国主义大批的军火和武器供应的巴蒂斯塔独裁者最近开始对古巴起义军发动了一次所谓“决定性”的进攻。为了阻止古巴起义军的胜利发展，巴蒂斯塔在这次作战中增调了大批援军，组织了“新的战斗营”，并且使用了飞机和快速舰。
    激烈的战斗主要发生在古巴东部的奥连特、拉斯维利亚斯及卡马圭三个省内。在被起义军包围的奥连特省圣地亚哥周围以及这个省的关塔那摩美国海军基地附近，战斗特别激烈。政府军连日出动空军，不仅轰炸起义军的阵地，而且对作战地区的居民点滥施轰炸。但是，巴蒂斯塔所发动的进攻遭到起义军的顽强抵抗。在奥连特省，起义军对圣地亚哥的压力越来越大，政府军不但无法突破起义军布下的半径六英里的包围圈，并且在21日又被迫撤离了距这个城市仅仅四英里的一个城镇；同时，古巴起义军又占领了关塔那摩附近一个名叫塞维利亚的城镇，起义军俘掳了十九名政府军，并且缴获了大量武器。
    在拉斯维利亚斯省，古巴起义军攻克了十二个城镇之后，已经完全包围了这个省的首府圣克拉拉城。圣克拉拉和哈瓦那之间的电讯联络已经在25日晚被切断。同时，据报道，起义军正在已经攻占的城镇附近建立地方人民政府。
    起义军所取得的新的胜利使独裁者巴蒂斯塔恼羞成怒。独裁政府的军队在26日接到了一项军事命令，要求政府军自26日起不择手段地对起义军和被起义军占领地区的人民滥施轰炸。同时，政府军正在加紧向拉斯维利亚斯省增派援军。
    在评述巴蒂斯塔所发动的这次所谓“决定性”进攻时，就连美国报纸也不得不承认，巴蒂斯塔将以失败告终。
    在古巴起义军接连获得许多胜利、巴蒂斯塔独裁统治日益呈现不稳情势下，美国正阴谋利用美洲国家组织来干涉古巴的内政。
    美联社26日自华盛顿发出的一则消息透露，美国最近策动了一些拉丁美洲国家来商讨如何干预古巴的内政。这家通讯社说，这次秘密会议“已经进行了数星期”，而“美国也参与了对古巴局势的讨论”。阿根廷“时报”在10日发表的一篇评论中说，“在古巴爱国者武装斗争的高潮逼得（古巴独裁者）巴蒂斯塔进退无路时，华盛顿加紧了通过美洲国家组织干涉古巴内政来挽救巴蒂斯塔分子的阴谋活动”。
    这一家报纸指出，“纽约时报”曾经在9日的社论中说过：“现在唯一的一线希望寄托于美洲国家组织的干涉”。
