    Physical Labor Doesn't Make People Stupid!
    Tang Yian

    Comrade Wei Gao believes: "People engaged in mental labor don't need to participate in physical labor; excessive physical labor will hinder their mental development." Judging from the overall spirit of Wei's article, the word "excessive" here is superfluous, because what Wei wants to emphasize is "not necessary," not the issue of "excessive" or "not excessive." Therefore, to put Comrade Wei Gao's words more clearly, it is: Physical labor will make people stupid. To prove the correctness of his argument, he cited the Soviet film "The Great Beginning" as an example. He said: "Like the child in the film 'The Great Beginning,' if he were asked to participate in more physical labor, he would not be able to play the piano well so quickly." Besides this, he did not offer other sufficient reasons to prove his argument. Therefore, I also intend to start with the film "The Great Beginning."

    In my opinion, the film "The Great Beginning" not only does not help Comrade Wei Gao, but it is precisely a case of "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet." Those who have seen the film "The Great Beginning" may still remember "Little Sun" and his mother. When "Little Sun" had just shown some talent in piano playing, his mother doted on him in every possible way, even "protecting" his talent and "protecting" his fingers, not even letting him do the slightest housework (such as sweeping the floor, wiping the table, etc.). In her view, labor would make "Little Sun's" fingers clumsy, thus hindering his fingers from moving freely on the piano keys, hindering the development of his talent. This idea quickly infected "Little Sun," making him develop the bad habit of a young master who loved leisure and hated labor. Then, was "Little Sun's" "mental labor" performance very good? Did he play the piano "uniquely"? The answer is: No! Due to his mother's doting, a sense of pride gradually grew in "Little Sun's" young mind, so he failed the "music theory" exam, and in the piano playing skills, he was surpassed by a child who had developed a love of labor in the nursery and had once tidied up "Little Sun's" messy room. May I ask Comrade Wei Gao: Is "Little Sun's" failure due to his "excessive participation in physical labor"? Obviously, Comrade Wei Gao's attitude toward the "fingers" of piano-playing children is probably somewhat similar to that of "Little Sun's" mother.

    Now, let's look back at today's facts! Since the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, many miracles have appeared on both the industrial and agricultural fronts. Countless worker and peasant inventors have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in the fields and workshops of the motherland. Moreover, some of their inventions and creations are often things that those accustomed to mental labor would not even dare to think of. For example, Comrade Cai Zuquan, a high-vacuum precision instrument expert in Shanghai, is an ordinary worker from an urban poor family who only studied for three years and started working in a factory as an apprentice at the age of fourteen. Since 1954, he has successively manufactured eighteen kinds of high-vacuum precision instruments that had always relied on foreign imports and that experts and professors had felt helpless to produce; he also installed more than twenty sets of high-vacuum systems for Fudan University and other units. All these instruments have reached international advanced levels, while the cost is generally only about one-tenth of that of imported goods. For example, those who created the miracle of producing more than 10,000 catties of grain per mu on the agricultural front are also ordinary but daring and capable farmers. Examples like this are already too numerous to mention in our country today.

    Writing this, we cannot help but ask Comrade Wei Gao: How will you explain these eloquent facts? Is it that the mental abilities of these ordinary worker and peasant inventors are not developed enough? No! Then, perhaps it is because they did not "participate excessively in physical labor"? No, even less! Given this, how did Comrade Wei Gao come to the conclusion that physical labor hinders mental development?

    Of course, we cannot draw the conclusion from this that "those directly engaged in the production of material resources also have no need to master too much theory." (See Wei's article) On the contrary, when we look at the problem with a materialist and developmental perspective, we will say: Highly modernized production labor requires people to have rich scientific and theoretical knowledge; and for the vast number of workers and peasants who have been proven by facts to have outstanding talents, once they master rich theory, they will create even greater and more amazing miracles.

    Secondly, the widespread implementation of the Party's education policy in the country for the past six months has now won glorious victories. A new situation of great reform in teaching, great revolution in academic thought, great development in scientific research, and a great leap forward in ideological awareness has emerged nationwide. Currently, the "National Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor" being held in Beijing is demonstrating the great vitality of the Party's education policy. All the exhibits in this exhibition are the crystallization of the combination of mental and physical labor, and many of them have reached international levels; these achievements have been achieved by advancing along the road of combining education with productive labor. From this, who can draw the conclusion that physical labor hinders mental development?

    Let me give another example that happened in the Law Department of our Renmin University. We study social sciences, and this semester we have also implemented the half-work, half-study system. Like students in science and engineering, physical labor can not only make us "red" but also help us become "expert," that is, help our mental abilities develop. If you don't believe it, look at the facts: Most of the students in our department have been sent to the Ming Tombs in Changping and the Hongqi People's Commune for half-work, half-study. Although they cannot listen to teachers' lectures in class all day as they used to, life has taught them living Marxism-Leninism. Recently, the students of Class 3, Grade 4 of our department, based on some problems they discovered while eating, living, and working with the peasants, conducted research with the assistance of the peasants and wrote several scientific papers, such as: "Experiences in Autumn Sweet Potato Harvesting Work," "Problems Existing in the No. 7 Brigade Canteen in the Past and Present and Improvement Measures," etc. These papers are closely linked to reality, have flesh and blood, and can solve practical problems, so they are deeply welcomed by the peasants. For example, the article "Experiences in Autumn Sweet Potato Harvesting Work" proposed the question of how to organize labor, which was immediately adopted and used by local cadres. The peasant comrades said: "Leave us a copy of your article. It would be best to send it to the Beijing Daily or the Beijing Peasants' Daily to be published as well." Obviously, such papers cannot be written by "simply engaging in mental labor" in the library. They are truly worthy of being products of independent thinking.

    In summary, it is enough to prove that Comrade Wei Gao's argument that "people engaged in mental labor do not need to participate in physical labor, and excessive physical labor will hinder their mental development" is completely untenable. Physical labor will never make people stupid, but the combination of mental and physical labor can greatly develop people's mental abilities—whether from the perspective of "redness" or "expertise."

    Finally, it is necessary to point out that Comrade Wei Gao's view reflects his emotion of looking down on physical labor and physical laborers, which is precisely a clear white line running through Wei's article and must be thoroughly criticized.

    体力劳动不会使人变笨！
    唐益安
    魏高同学认为：“从事脑力劳动的人不必参加体力劳动，过多的体力劳动会妨碍他的脑力的发展。”从魏文的整个精神来看，这里“过多的”三字是多余的，因为魏文所要强调的是“不必”，而不是“过多”、“不过多”的问题。所以，把魏高同学的话说得明确一些，那就是：体力劳动会使人变笨。为了证明自己的论点的正确，他引用了苏联电影“天职”作为例子。他说：“如电影‘天职’中的小孩，如果叫他多参加体力劳动，他就不可能很快地弹好钢琴。”除此之外，他并没有提出其它充足的理由来证明自己的论点。因此，我也打算就从电影“天职”谈起。
    在我看来，电影“天职”不仅帮不了魏高同学的忙，倒恰恰是“搬起石头砸了自己的脚”。看过电影“天职”的人，也许还记得“小太阳”和他的母亲吧。当“小太阳”在钢琴弹奏上刚刚显露了一些才能的时候，他的母亲就对他百般宠爱，甚至为了“保护”他的天才，“保护”他的手指，连最轻微的家务劳动（如扫地、擦桌子等）都不让他干。在她看来，劳动会使“小太阳”的手指变得粗笨，因而会妨碍他的手指灵活自如地在琴键上跳动，妨碍他的天才的发挥。这种思想很快传染给了“小太阳”，使他养成了好逸恶劳的少爷习气。那么“小太阳”的“脑力劳动”的成绩是不是很好呢？他钢琴是否弹得“独一无二”了呢？回答是：不！由于母亲的溺爱，在“小太阳”的幼小心灵里逐渐滋长起了骄傲情绪，因而“乐理”没有考及格，在钢琴的弹奏技巧上，也被一位在保育院里养成了热爱劳动习惯、曾经替“小太阳”整理过杂乱的房间的小孩超过了。请问魏高同学：难道“小太阳”的失败是由于他“多参加体力劳动”的缘故吗？显而易见，魏高同学在对待弹钢琴孩子的“手指”问题上，恐怕和“小太阳”的母亲有些相像。
    现在，让我们再回过头来看看今天的事实吧！自从祖国大跃进以来，无论在工业或农业战线上都出现了不少奇迹。无数工人、农民发明家，正如雨后春笋般地在祖国的田野上、车间里诞生。而且，他们的有些发明创造，又往往是那些习惯于脑力劳动的人连想都不敢想的。例如：上海高真空精密仪器专家蔡祖泉同志，就是一个出身于城市贫民家庭，只念过三年书，从十四岁起就进工厂当徒工的普通工人。1954年以来，他先后制成了十八种过去一直依靠外国进口、专家教授都感到没办法的高真空精密仪器；还为复旦大学等单位装制了二十多套高真空系统。所有这些仪器都达到了国际先进水平，而成本一般却只有进口货的十分之一左右。又如：在农业战线上创造了粮食亩产万斤以上奇迹的，也都是些普通的但又敢想敢干的农民。像这样的例子，今天在我国早已多得举不胜举了。
    写到这里，我们不禁要问魏高同学：你将怎样解释这些雄辩的事实呢？难道说这些普通工人、农民发明家的脑力还不够发达吗？不！那么，也许因为他们并没有“过多的参加体力劳动”吗？不，更不！既然如此，魏高同学又从何得出体力劳动会妨碍脑力发展的结论来呢？
    当然，从这里也不能得出这样的结论：“直接从事于物质资料生产的人，也没有必要掌握太多的理论。”（见魏文）恰恰相反，当我们用唯物的、发展的眼光来看问题的时候，我们就会说：高度现代化的生产劳动，需要人们都具有丰富的科学理论知识；而对于已经为事实证明具有卓越才能的广大工农劳动人民来说，一旦掌握了丰富的理论，那么，他们就会创造出更巨大、更惊人的奇迹来。
    其次，半年以来党的教育方针在全国的普遍推行，现在已赢得了光辉的胜利。一个教学大改革、学术思想大革命、科学研究大发展、思想意识大跃进的新局面已在全国范围内出现。目前，正在北京展出的“全国教育和生产劳动相结合展览会”正显示出了党的教育方针的巨大生命力。这个展览会的全部展品，都是脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的结晶，其中有许多已达到国际水平；这些成就都是沿着教育与生产劳动相结合的道路前进才取得的。从这里，有谁能得出体力劳动会妨碍脑力发展的结论来呢？
    让我再举一个发生在我们人民大学法律系的例子来看一看吧。我们是学社会科学的，这学期我们也实行了半工半读，和理工科的同学一样，体力劳动不但能使我们“红”，而且还能帮助我们“专”，也就是能帮助我们的脑力得到发展。不信，请看事实：我系的大部分同学都下放在昌平十三陵及红旗人民公社半工半读，虽然他们不能像过去那样成天在课堂上听老师讲课了，但生活使他们学到了活的马克思列宁主义。最近，我系四年级三班的同学，根据自己在和农民同吃、同住、同劳动中发现的一些问题，在农民的协助下进行了研究，写出了好几篇科学论文，如：“关于秋收白薯工作的体会”、“七大队食堂过去、当前存在的问题和改进办法”等等。这些论文密切联系实际，有血有肉，能解决实际问题，因而深受农民欢迎。如“关于秋收白薯工作的体会”一文中提出了如何组织劳动力的问题，立即被当地干部采纳使用。农民同志们说：“你们的文章留给我们一份，最好也把它送到北京日报或北京农民报上登一登才好。”很显然，这样的论文决不是钻在图书馆里“单纯从事脑力劳动”所能写出来的。它们真正称得上是独立思考的产物。
    综上所述，已经足够证明，魏高同学的“从事脑力劳动的人不必参加体力劳动，过多的体力劳动会妨碍他的脑力的发展”的论点是完全站不住脚的。体力劳动决不会使人变笨，而脑力劳动和体力劳动的相结合却能使人的脑力——无论从“红”的角度或“专”的角度来说——得到极大的发展。
    最后，有必要指出：魏高同学的这种观点正反映了他轻视体力劳动、轻视体力劳动者的情绪，而这，也正是贯串在魏文中一根鲜明的白线，必须彻底批判。
