Cotton Yarn Made Into Gasoline Lamp Mantles
Who has ever heard of making gasoline lamp mantles from cotton yarn? Huang Suying and other female workers in Anhui Province have created this miracle.

Huang Suying was originally a member of a hardware repair cooperative, often repairing gasoline lamps in rural areas. Whenever there was a shortage of mantles, farmers would always ask: "You only know how to repair them, why don't you make some mantles?" Huang Suying thought: During the Great Leap Forward, rural areas need gasoline lamps, so we must find a way to make mantles. Her idea was supported by leaders and many cooperative members. But some people said, "Gasoline lamp mantles are made of asbestos, you want to use cotton yarn, it's simply nonsense!" Huang Suying ignored these gossips and started a difficult experiment with six cooperative members. The first time, they used thin steel wire and asbestos thread to make a mantle, but it didn't light up. The second time, they soaked rayon in salt water, dried it, and burned it, but the gasoline lamp blew it off as soon as it was turned on. The third time, they used cotton yarn and borax, but failed again. They failed more than a hundred times. Huang Suying thought, "Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." So, she reported their experiment to the leaders, who gave her great encouragement and support, saying: "We will give you whatever you need." The County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also sent someone to help. Huang Suying was very touched. She and several cooperative members continued to experiment, and after failing 354 times, they finally succeeded in trial production before "July 1st"!

After the cotton yarn mantle was made, the Fuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting to promote its use throughout the county and approved the establishment of the Fuyang Mantle Factory. This factory already has 101 workers, producing 18,000 mantles per day.

At the Agricultural Science Research Station
In the mountainous area of Guizhou Province—Shiping Township, Changshi District, Dafang County—grows a strange multi-spike rice. This rice branches out at each node, with a maximum of four branches, and each spike has about 600 grains. Many people curiously travel from afar to see this rare multi-spike rice.

This multi-spike rice was originally successfully tested by the agricultural experiment station led by Zheng Xinzhen, a local woman.

When transplanting seedlings this year, Zheng Xinzhen thought of a question: Can barnyard grass branch out? Why can't rice branch out? Old farmers said: "Barnyard grass has thick stalks and many spikes, growing in the middle of the field, it is bestowed by the emperor." Zheng Xinzhen didn't believe this superstitious saying. She first studied the experiment with the people at the experiment station. After many efforts, the rice really branched out at each node, and was covered with clusters of grain.

In the past six months, Zheng Xinzhen and her partners have also successfully tested the use of corn pollen to pollinate rice, making the rice grow more sturdily. They also created artificial auxiliary puffed corn to make corn sprout like rice, and created 15 kinds of agricultural tools such as water airplane seedling boats and seeders. This year, their experimental field yielded 2,645 jin of rice per mu, which is more than 2,300 jin more than last year.

The experiment station led by Zheng Xinzhen has now been named "Agricultural Science Research Station."

Women's Self-Defense Forces on the Coastal Defense Front
On a small island on the front line of coastal defense in Fujian Province, there is a self-defense force composed entirely of women. They assist the troops in guarding sentry posts day and night, and patrol the sea, becoming a powerful helper to the coastal defense troops. The soldiers call them "red inspectors."

Since our army launched punitive artillery fire on the Kuomintang troops in Kinmen on August 23, this women's self-defense force has been vigilantly standing on the post of defending the coast. They share sentry duty with male militiamen, with them responsible for the mountains and the male militiamen responsible for the coast. They also helped the elderly and weak residents enter air-raid shelters during the artillery battles. Once, Cai Xi, who was over sixty years old, was helped into the cave by them. Not long after, Cai Xi's house was hit by enemy artillery. They also often rescued state property in the midst of artillery fire. Once, just as three grain ships docked on this small island, the enemy opened fire. They and the male militiamen rescued the grain. Each bag of grain weighed more than 200 jin. They couldn't carry it alone, so two people carried one bag. From 4 pm to 8 pm, they finally moved all the grain from the ships. Later, they rescued a second and third time, rescuing a total of 210,000 jin of grain and more than 100 dan of salt.

The self-defense team members organized four groups to help the soldiers wash and mend clothes. Every day, as soon as it was light, they ran to the position to ask the soldiers for dirty clothes to wash. Sometimes, when they encountered soldiers wiping cannons, they helped them wipe cannons so that they could change clothes. Every time they went to deliver clothes, they also helped the soldiers sew quilts and tidy up their rooms. The self-defense team also sent Lin Yachou and Lin Guizhi to cook for the troops' headquarters and the police station. No matter how fierce the artillery fire was, they persisted in their work, ensuring that meals were served on time, and never missed a meal.

    巾帼英雄看今朝

    棉纱制成了汽油灯纱罩
    谁听说过用棉纱制作汽油灯的纱罩吗？安徽省的女工黄素英等人，就创造了这个奇迹。
    黄素英原是个五金修配合作社的社员，常在农村修配汽灯。遇到纱罩缺乏时，农民们总是问：“你们光会修理，为啥不造些纱罩呢？黄素英想：大跃进中农村多需要汽灯，一定得想办法造纱罩。她的这个想法，受到了领导上和许多社员的支持。可是有的人说：“汽油灯泡是石棉做的，你们要用棉纱制，简直是胡闹！”黄素英不理睬这些闲话，和六个社员一起开始了艰苦的试验。第一次用细钢丝和石线打成纱罩，一烧不亮；第二次把人造丝浸在盐水里再晾干了烧，不料汽油灯一放气就吹掉了；第三次用棉纱加硼砂，又失败了。一直试验了一百多次都失败了。黄素英想世上无难事，功到自然成。于是，她向领导上反映了她们试验的情况，得到很大鼓励和支持，领导上表示：需要什么给你们什么。中共县委还派专人前来帮助。黄素英非常感动，她和几位社员继续进行试验，失败了三百五十四次，终于在“七一”以前试制成功了！
    棉纱纱罩制成以后，中共阜阳县委召开了现场会议，在全县推广使用，并批准建立阜阳纱罩厂。这个厂已有一百零一名工人，日产一万八千只纱罩。
    在农业科学研究站
    在贵州省的山区——大方县长石区石坪乡，长着一种奇怪的多穗稻。这种稻子节节发杈，最多的发上四杈，每穗大约有六百多粒谷粒。许多人都好奇地从很远的地方跑来观看这种少见的多穗稻。
    这种多穗稻原来是当地妇女郑新珍领导的农业试验站试验成功的。
    今年栽秧的时候，郑新珍想到一个问题，毛稗能发杈？稻子为什么不能发杈？老农民说：“毛稗秆粗、穗多，生在田中间，是皇帝封的。郑新珍不相信这种迷信说法，她就和试验站的人一起先研究试验，经过她的许多努力，稻子果真节节发杈，长满了累累实实的谷子。
    半年来，郑新珍同她的伙伴们还试验成功了用玉米给谷授花粉，使谷子长得更加结实，又用人工辅助爆生玉米，使玉米和谷子一样发芽，还创造了水飞机秧船、播种机等十五种农具。她们的试验田今年每亩水稻收了二千六百四十五斤，比去年多收二千三百多斤。
    郑新珍所领导的这个试验站现在已被命名为“农业科学研究站”。
    海防前哨的妇女自卫队
    在福建省海防前线一个小岛上，有一支全部由妇女组成的自卫队。她们日夜协助部队站岗放哨，出海巡逻，成了海防部队的有力助手，战士们都把她们称为“红色的检查员”。
    8月23日我军对金门国民党军队进行惩罚性炮击以来，这支妇女自卫队就一直警惕地站在保卫海防的岗位上。她们和男民兵分工站岗，她们负责山上，男民兵负责海边。她们还在炮战中帮助老弱居民进入防炮洞。有一次，六十多岁的蔡西被她们扶进洞内不久，蔡西家的房子就被敌炮击中。她们还经常在炮火中抢救国家财产。有一次，三艘粮船刚靠上这个小岛，敌人就开炮了。她们和男民兵一道抢救粮食，一包粮食二百多斤重，她们一个人扛不动，就两个人抬一包。从下午四时抢救到晚上八时，终于将全船粮食搬运完了。以后，她们又抢救过第二次，第三次，一共抢救了二十一万斤粮食和一百多担食盐。
    自卫队员们组织了四个小组，帮助战士们洗衣服、补衣服。每天天刚亮，她们就跑向阵地，向战士们要脏衣服来洗。有时碰到战士们在擦炮，她们就帮他们擦炮，让他们去换衣服。每次去送衣服的时候，她们还帮助战士们缝棉被、整理房间。自卫队还派林亚绸、林桂枝两个队员为部队指挥部和派出所煮饭，不管炮火如何猛烈，她们还是坚持工作，保证按时开饭，从来没有误过一餐。
