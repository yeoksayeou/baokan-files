Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 10th: "By 1961, East Germany will catch up with and surpass West Germany in the supply of the most important industrial consumer goods. Currently, most of East Germany's agricultural products, calculated on a per capita basis, already exceed West Germany's. In cultural development, national education, and higher and specialized education, it has also far surpassed West Germany's level of development." This was stated by Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, in his policy address to the People's Chamber of East Germany on the 8th.

    In his speech, when talking about the domestic situation, Grotewohl said: "By 1965, our total industrial output value will double that of 1957. This year is the year with the highest growth rate of total industrial output value in East Germany since 1953. As of November 30th this year, production has increased by 11.2% compared to the same period last year. The industrial output value in October reached 5.3 billion marks, which is the peak of this year's production."

    Grotewohl continued, saying that there are two prerequisites for solving the main economic tasks: the first is raw materials, and the second is to give full play to the people's creativity and utilize all potentials. Because we maintain friendly relations with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, we will obtain the raw materials we need. On the other hand, the majority of our working people are also increasingly learning to think and work like socialists.

    Grotewohl said that in terms of basic raw material industries, the chemical industry is our center. Its main development direction is the manufacture of plastics and synthetic fibers.

    In discussing foreign policy, Prime Minister Grotewohl said that the East German government is willing to negotiate with the governments of all relevant countries on all issues related to the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Berlin, as long as such negotiations are conducive to peace and easing international tensions.

    Grotewohl said that the East German government believes that the Soviet government's proposal on the status of West Berlin is of great international significance. This proposal points out prospects for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, for a peaceful settlement of the German question, and for the reunification of Germany.

    Grotewohl said that the East German government welcomes the Soviet government's decision to transfer all administrative powers over Berlin, which are still being exercised by Soviet institutions, to East Germany. He said that the United States, Britain, and France should also follow the Soviet Union's example.

    Regarding the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, Grotewohl said that this issue is indispensable for a peaceful settlement of the German question and should be given top priority. He said that East Germany will do everything possible to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany would bring the two Germanys closer.

    Grotewohl said that as long as the Bonn government abandons its war policy, East Germany and West Germany can reach mutual understanding.

    In discussing East Germany's foreign policy, Grotewohl said that East Germany is part of the socialist camp, and for the benefit of the entire socialist camp, we will undertake our glorious task. East Germany supports the Polish government's plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe in two stages and is prepared to participate in the Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone at any time. East Germany is willing to help newly independent countries in Asia and Africa develop their national industries. It is willing to establish friendly relations with any country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The United States and Britain do not currently recognize East Germany, but one day, under the pressure of their own people, they will have to recognize the facts.

    格罗提渥总理发表施政演说
    民主德国农产品按人口计超过西德
    据新华社柏林10日电  “到1961年，民主德国将在最重要的工业消费品供应方面赶上和超过西德。目前，民主德国大部分的农业产品，按人口平均计算已经超过西德，在文化发展、国民教育、高等学校和专科学校教育事业中，也已经远远地超过了西德的发展水平。”这是德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥8日在民主德国人民议院会议上就政府施政纲领发表演说时所说的。
    格罗提渥在他的这篇演说中谈到国内情况时说道：“到1965年，我们的工业总产值将比1957年增加一倍。今年是民主德国在1953年以后工业总产值增长率最高的一年。到今年11月30日为止，比去年同一时期，生产量增加了11.2％，10月份的工业产值达五十三亿马克，是今年生产的高峰。”
    格罗提渥接着说，解决主要经济任务的前提有两个：第一是原料，第二是充分发挥人民的创造力和利用所有的潜力。由于我们同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家保持着友好关系，我们将获得所需要的原料。另一方面，我们的多数劳动人民也日益学会了像社会主义者一样来进行思考和工作。
    格罗提渥说，在基本原料工业方面，化学工业是我们的中心。它的主要发展方向是塑料和合成纤维制造。
    在谈到对外政策时，格罗提渥总理说，民主德国政府愿意就同撤退在柏林的外国驻军有关的一切问题和各有关国家的政府进行谈判，只要这种谈判对和平和缓和国际紧张局势有利。
    格罗提渥说，民主德国政府认为，苏联政府关于西柏林地位问题的建议具有重大的国际意义。这个建议为缔结对德和约、为和平解决德国问题、为重新统一德国指出了前景。
    格罗提渥说，民主德国政府欢迎苏联政府关于把现在仍由苏联机构执行的管理柏林的一切职权移交给民主德国的决定。他说，美、英、法三国也应效法苏联的这个榜样。
    关于对德和约问题，格罗提渥说，这个问题是和平解决德国问题所不能缺少的，应该提到第一位。他说，民主德国将尽一切努力争取缔结对德和约。而缔结对德和约就可使两个德国接近。
    格罗提渥说，只要波恩政府抛弃战争政策，民主德国和西德就可以取得互相谅解。
    在谈到民主德国的外交政策时，格罗提渥说，民主德国是社会主义阵营的一部分，为了整个社会主义阵营的利益，我们将承担起自己的光荣任务。民主德国支持波兰政府提出的关于分两个阶段建立中欧无原子武器区的计划，并且准备随时参加中欧无原子武器区。民主德国愿意帮助亚非民族独立国家发展它们的民族工业。它愿意在平等互利的基础上和任何国家建立友好关系，美英两国现在不承认民主德国，然而，总有一天它们在本国人民的压力下将不得不承认事实。
