Contradictory Plans, Failed Meeting
    ——A Commentary on the Meeting of Representatives of the Inter-American "Committee of Twenty-One"
    Zhang Ye

    The meeting of representatives of the Inter-American "Committee of Twenty-One" held in Washington, after more than three weeks of delays and incessant quarrels, finally came to an end on December 12. This meeting discussed the issues of "economic cooperation" among American countries and U.S. "aid" to Latin American countries, based on the "Operation Pan America" plan proposed by Brazilian President Kubitschek. However, the meeting resulted in only some empty resolutions regarding the so-called "aid" from the United States. Furthermore, a series of suggestions passed by the meeting will be delayed for four or five months, allowing the Council of the Organization of American States or the Special Committee of Eleven Nations to "conduct further research." It seems that the "Operation Pan America" plan, on which Kubitschek and the leadership groups of other Latin American countries placed great hope, has already shown ominous prospects after initial discussions.

    The "Operation Pan America" plan was proposed amid the growing dissatisfaction and protests of Latin American countries against the colonialist plunder policy of U.S. imperialism, and it is itself a product of the sharpening contradictions between the United States and Latin American countries. In Kubitschek's own words, the "Operation Pan America" plan is a "protest against the existing unequal economic conditions in the Western Hemisphere." As everyone knows, the United States has always regarded Latin America as its own "backyard," where it unscrupulously carries out economic plunder, political control, and military aggression. Last year and early this year, the economic crisis in the United States seriously affected the sales markets and prices of major exports of Latin American countries, causing serious economic disasters in Latin American countries. This United States, which calls itself a "good neighbor" to Latin American countries, not only does not provide any real assistance to its southern neighbors, but instead takes advantage of their misfortune, intensifies the implementation of unequal trade policies of "selling high and buying cheap" and "selling more and buying less," and deliberately lowers the prices of imported raw materials, restricting the import quotas of petroleum and lead-zinc under the pretext of protecting its own industry and commerce, further worsening the economic situation of Latin American countries. For example, Brazil, where coffee accounts for 70% of its total exports, has been forced to reduce its coffee exports by 40% due to the United States' reduction in coffee imports and its lowering of coffee prices. This year, Brazil's income from coffee exports will be reduced by $500 million compared to last year, and it is expected that next year's coffee stock will reach 34 million bags (60 kilograms per bag). This situation forces Brazil to reduce coffee production, lay off coffee plantation workers, and face the difficulties of severe inflation with a huge payment deficit. The situation of other Latin American countries is generally the same. This has not only aroused anti-American sentiment among the Latin American people, but also sharpened the contradictions between the ruling groups of Latin American countries who demand independent economic development and the U.S. monopoly capital that attempts to seize more and more profits.

    On May 28 this year, Kubitschek wrote a letter to Eisenhower, proposing his "Operation Pan America" plan and requesting a meeting of the heads of American states to discuss and improve the relationship between the United States and Latin American countries. The main contents of the plan are: in the political field, relying on the United States to get rid of the "unremarkable rearguard position" that Latin American countries have hitherto occupied in international affairs; in the economic field, relying on U.S. "aid" and investment to stabilize and develop the Latin American economy. To a certain extent, this plan reflects the desire of the national bourgeoisie, which was prevalent in Latin America at that time, to change the backward economic state. Therefore, it was supported by the ruling groups of other Latin American countries. However, the plan itself contains factors that are incompatible with the goals it hopes to achieve, and that is its dependence on the United States. Because it is precisely the U.S. plunder and control that have placed Latin American countries in a subordinate position and subjected them to severe economic difficulties. How can one expect U.S. imperialism to show mercy and help them get rid of their subordinate position and resolve their economic difficulties?

    The U.S. ruling group's support for Kubitschek's "Operation Pan America" plan and its agreement to convene the "Committee of Twenty-One" meeting after the informal meeting of the foreign ministers of the American states in September was merely a way to cope with the situation on the one hand, and to take advantage of Kubitschek's illusions about the United States to revive the bankrupt "Pan-Americanism" through the "Operation Pan America" he proposed on the other.

    Although the United States outwardly supported Kubitschek's proposal, it actually raised different opinions on every one of Kubitschek's suggestions. For example, Kubitschek suggested that a meeting of the heads of American states should be held as soon as possible to discuss his plan, but the United States forced Kubitschek to abandon this suggestion under the pretext that any high-level meeting required full preparation. Kubitschek originally intended to carry out "Operation Pan America" outside the scope of the Organization of American States, because this organization had already lost its prestige in the hearts of the Latin American people, but the United States insisted that any joint action of the American states should be carried out within the scope of the Organization of American States, and Kubitschek finally abandoned his position in this regard. During Dulles' visit to Brazil, the Brazilian government repeatedly requested that the U.S. government provide loans to "Brazilian Petroleum Corporation" and demanded that the United States guarantee that Brazil could sell coffee at the best prices; Dulles' answer was that more private investment should be attracted, and with regard to the coffee issue, he expressed his willingness to participate in international agreements for managing the market, but refused all compromise measures to increase U.S. coffee imports. When Kubitschek asked the United States to expand private investment in Latin American countries, the United States put forward harsh conditions such as guaranteeing the free transfer of profits and guaranteeing no confiscation of property and no taxation. Kubitschek also demanded a system that would guarantee the prices of raw materials, but the United States, under the pretext that this was a matter for the raw material producing countries themselves, opposed joining the system in principle. As for Kubitschek's proposal to establish a regional common market, although the United States expressed its agreement, it also put forward the condition that the agreement on the establishment of a common market should not lead to measures that discriminate against U.S. products.

    It is precisely because of this that the meeting of the Inter-American "Committee of Twenty-One" was filled with pessimism from the very beginning, and it has been in a deadlock because of differences of opinion and quarrels.

    Since Latin American countries are experiencing severe economic disasters, the issue of U.S. "aid" has been the most debated issue at the meeting. At the meeting, Latin American countries demanded that the United States implement "a large-scale long-term aid program," the main point of which was to require the U.S. government to contribute to the proposed "Inter-American Economic Development Bank" in order to obtain loans that were slightly easier to control than private investment to overcome the economic difficulties of these countries. However, the United States was not enthusiastic about contributing to the "Inter-American Economic Development Bank." Dillon, the head of the U.S. delegation and Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, only expressed his "support" for the proposed "Inter-American Economic Development Bank" at the meeting, and mainly emphasized the importance of private capital, believing that U.S. national loans could not guarantee the economic development of Latin American countries, and demanded that these countries create good conditions for attracting private investment, and grant privileges and guarantees. As everyone knows, U.S. monopoly capital has always regarded private investment as the main means of seizing high profits and plundering raw material sources in Latin America. U.S. private investment in Latin America has reached as high as $8.8 billion, ranking second among U.S. foreign private investment. However, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, among the $3 billion increase in U.S. foreign private direct investment this year, the investment in Latin America has increased the most. What is the reason? The United Nations statistics gave a good answer: for every dollar invested in Latin America, U.S. monopoly capital obtained a profit of $3.17. In addition, U.S. monopoly capital has also controlled the economic lifeline of these countries through investment. The emphasis on private investment by the U.S. representatives at the meeting fully exposed the U.S. effort to achieve the goal of further plundering and enslaving these countries by expanding private investment in Latin America.

    The meeting did not achieve any concrete results on the issues that Latin American countries were most concerned about, such as stabilizing market prices, lifting U.S. import restrictions, establishing regional common markets, and expanding technical cooperation, except for the establishment of a working committee of eleven nations to "continue research."

    The attitude of the United States at the meeting of the "Committee of Twenty-One" aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the representatives of Latin American countries attending the meeting and the public opinion of these countries. Schmidt, the head of the Brazilian delegation, even openly warned the United States at the meeting that only genuine assistance without any conditions attached can be accepted, and only such assistance can enable the recipient countries to develop industry and improve their living standards. Schmidt emphasized that no agreement could be reached between the United States and Latin American countries unless the United States guaranteed to change its policy. In addition, Schmidt also believed that expanding trade with China and the Soviet Union would save Brazil from economic exhaustion. In line with the spirit of Schmidt's speech was a speech given by Kubitschek at the Higher Military School during the meeting. In his speech, Kubitschek compared the foreign economic policies of the United States and the Soviet Union and pointed out the beneficial nature of the economic assistance provided by the Soviet Union to underdeveloped countries. He said that the characteristic of Soviet aid is to provide large loans with low interest rates, and it can be repaid by providing goods.

    The failure of the meeting of the Inter-American "Committee of Twenty-One" shows that the contradictions between the United States and Latin American countries are growing; it has been proven that it is impossible for Latin American countries to rely on the United States to solve their own problems, and the United States' attempt to wantonly plunder Latin America will encounter increasing opposition than before.

    矛盾的计划  失败的会议
    ——评美洲“二十一国委员会”代表会议
    章叶
    在华盛顿举行的美洲“二十一国委员会”代表会议，经过三个多星期的延宕，不休的争吵，总算在12月12日收场了。这次会议根据巴西总统库比契克提出的“泛美活动”计划讨论了美洲国家的“经济合作”和美国“援助”拉丁美洲国家的问题。但是，会议结果，关于美国所谓“援助”之类的问题只作了一些空洞的决议。而会议通过的一系列建议，还要拖上四、五个月，让美洲国家组织理事会或十一国专门委员会去“作进一步研究”。看来，库比契克和拉丁美洲其他国家的领导集团寄以很大希望的“泛美活动”计划，初经讨论就已经显露出不妙的前景来了。
      “泛美活动”计划是在拉丁美洲各国对美帝国主义的殖民主义掠夺政策日益增长的不满和抗议中提出的，它本身就是美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的矛盾尖锐化的产物。用库比契克自己的话说，“泛美活动”计划是“对西半球现有经济条件不平等的抗议”。大家知道，美国一向把拉丁美洲当作自己的“后院”，在那里肆无忌惮地进行经济掠夺、政治控制和军事侵略。去年和今年初，美国的经济危机严重地影响了拉丁美洲国家主要出口品的销售市场和价格，引起了拉丁美洲国家严重的经济灾难。这个自称为拉丁美洲国家“好邻居”的美国，不但不给它的南部邻国以任何真正的援助，反而趁火打劫，加紧实行“贵卖贱买”、“多卖少买”的不平等贸易政策，并故意压低进口原料价格，借口保护本国工商业而限制石油和铅锌的进口额，使拉丁美洲国家的经济情况更加恶化。例如，咖啡占总输出70％的巴西，由于美国减少咖啡进口和压低咖啡价格，使巴西咖啡出口被迫减少40％，今年巴西从咖啡输出所得的收入将比去年减少五亿美元，预料明年的咖啡存货将达到三千四百万袋（每袋六十公斤）。这种情况迫使巴西减少咖啡生产，解雇咖啡种植工人，并面临支付赤字巨大的严重通货膨胀的困难。拉丁美洲其他国家的遭遇也大体相同。这就不仅激起拉丁美洲人民的反美情绪，而且也使要求经济独立发展的拉丁美洲国家统治集团和企图攫取越来越多的利润的美国垄断资本之间的矛盾尖锐化。
    库比契克在今年5月28日给艾森豪威尔写了一封信，提出他的“泛美活动”计划，并且要求举行美洲国家首脑会议，讨论和改善美国和拉丁美洲国家的关系。计划的主要内容是：在政治方面依靠美国以摆脱拉丁美洲国家直到目前为止在国际事务中所处的“毫不显著的后卫地位”；在经济方面依靠美国的“援助”和投资以稳定和发展拉丁美洲的经济。这个计划在一定程度上反映了当时拉丁美洲普遍存在民族资产阶级渴望改变落后的经济状态的要求，因此，得到拉丁美洲其他国家统治集团的支持。但是，这个计划的本身却包含着同他所希望达到的目的不能相容的因素，这就是他对美国的依赖。因为正是美国的掠夺和控制才使拉丁美洲国家处于从属地位和遭受严重的经济困难，又怎能指望美帝国主义发慈悲，帮助它们摆脱从属地位和解救经济困难呢？
    美国统治集团对库比契克的“泛美活动”计划之所以表示支持，并在9月间举行美洲国家外长非正式会议后又答应召开“二十一国委员会”会议，不过是一方面迫于形势，不得不应付一下，另方面也想利用库比契克对美国存在的幻想，通过他提出的“泛美活动”替破产了的“泛美主义”招魂。
    美国虽然表面上支持库比契克的建议，但实际上又对库比契克提出的每一项意见提出不同的意见来。例如，库比契克建议迅速召开美洲国家首脑会议讨论他的计划，而美国却借口任何高级会议都需要充分的准备，迫使库比契克放弃了这个建议。库比契克原来打算在美洲国家组织范围以外进行“泛美活动”，因为这个组织在拉丁美洲人民的心目中已经威信扫地，而美国却坚持美洲国家的任何共同行动，都应该在美洲国家组织范围内进行，库比契克也终于在这方面放弃了他的主张。在杜勒斯访问巴西期间，巴西政府曾一再要求由美国政府贷款给“巴西石油公司”，并要求美国保证巴西能按最好的价格销售咖啡；杜勒斯的回答却认为应该更多地吸引私人投资，对于咖啡问题，表示只愿意参加签订管理市场的国际协定，而拒绝增加美国咖啡进口额的一切折衷办法。当库比契克要求美国扩大对拉丁美洲国家的私人投资时，美国却又提出要保证利润自由转移和保证不没收财产、不抽税等苛刻条件。库比契克还要求有一种保证原料价格的体系，美国借口说这是原料生产国家自己的事情，在原则上反对加入这个体系。至于库比契克提出的建立地区性共同市场，美国虽然表示同意，但又提出关于建立共同市场的协定不应导致采取歧视美国产品措施的条件。
    正是因为这样，美洲“二十一国委员会”会议一开始就充满了悲观气氛，并且因为意见分歧和发生争吵而一直陷入僵局。
    由于拉丁美洲国家正在经历着严重的经济灾难，因此，关于美国的“援助”是会议中争论最多的问题。会上拉丁美洲国家要求美国实行“一个大规模的长期援助计划”，其中主要一点是要求美国政府出资参加拟议中的“泛美经济开发银行”，以便取得比私人投资稍易控制的贷款来克服这些国家的经济困难。但是，美国对于出资参加“泛美经济开发银行”并不热心。美国代表团团长、国务院主管经济事务的副国务卿狄龙在会上只是空洞表示“支持”“泛美经济开发银行”的拟议，而主要是强调私人资本的重要性，认为美国国家贷款不能保证拉丁美洲国家的经济发展，要求这些国家为吸收私人投资创造良好条件。并给予特权和保证。大家知道，美国垄断资本一向把私人投资作为在拉丁美洲攫取高额利润和掠夺原料来源的主要手段。美国在拉丁美洲的私人投资已高达八十八亿美元，占美国对外私人投资的第二位，但是，据美国商务部宣布，在今年美国增加的对外私人直接投资三十亿美元中，以在拉丁美洲的投资增加得最多。什么道理呢？联合国的统计作了很好的答复：美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲每投资一美元，就获得了三点一七美元的利润。此外，美国垄断资本还通过投资控制了这些国家的经济命脉。会上美国代表强调私人投资，这就完全暴露了美国竭力通过扩大对拉丁美洲的私人投资达到进一步掠夺和奴役这些国家的目的。
    会议对于拉丁美洲国家所最关心的稳定市场价格、取消美国进口限制、建立区域性共同市场和扩大技术合作等问题，除了通过成立一个十一国工作委员会“继续进行研究”以外，都没有取得任何具体结果。
    美国在“二十一国委员会”会议上的态度，引起了出席会议的拉丁美洲国家代表和这些国家舆论的普遍不满。巴西代表团团长施密特甚至在会上公开警告美国说，只有不附带任何条件的真正的援助才能接受，只有这种援助才能使受援国家发展工业和提高生活水平。施密特强调指出，除非美国保证改变政策，美国和拉丁美洲国家不可能达成任何协议。此外，施密特还认为，扩大与中国和苏联的贸易，将会使巴西免于遭到经济上的枯竭。同施密特的发言精神吻合的是会议期间库比契克在高等军事学校中的一席讲话。库比契克在讲话中比较了美苏两国的对外经济政策之后指出苏联给予不发达国家的经济援助的有利性质。他说，苏联援助的特点是提供利率低的大笔贷款，并且可以通过提供货物来偿清。
    美洲“二十一国委员会”会议的失败表明，美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的矛盾在增长；拉丁美洲国家想依靠美国解决自己的问题已经证明是此路不通，美国想恣意掠夺拉丁美洲将比从前遭到越来越大的反对。
