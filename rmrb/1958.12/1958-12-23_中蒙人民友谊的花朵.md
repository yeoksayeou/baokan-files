    The Flower of Friendship Between the Chinese and Mongolian Peoples
    By Our Correspondent Peng Fengye
    Economic and Cultural Cooperation Develops Daily
    The people of China and Mongolia are close neighbors with a traditional and intimate friendship. In 1952, Premier Zhou Enlai of China and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Tsedenbal of Mongolia signed the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement in Beijing, greatly strengthening the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. In recent years, through friendly visits and mutual support between the two peoples, the friendship between the two countries has been further consolidated and deepened.
    Let's start with a few figures. Since 1951, trade exchanges between China and Mongolia have been expanding, with trade volume increasing year by year. Compared with 1951, the trade volume in 1956 increased by 7.8 times. In 1958, it increased by more than 10% compared to 1957. In Mongolia, whether in cities or vast pastoral areas, Chinese-imported silk, cloth, and daily necessities can be seen everywhere. The number of famous Mongolian horses exported to China is also considerable. Since 1951, through the trade relations between the two countries, Mongolia has supplied China with more than 150,000 horses, powerfully supporting China's agricultural production.
    In terms of cultural cooperation, since 1954, the cultural departments of the two countries have signed cultural cooperation plans every year, enabling the cultural exchanges between China and Mongolia to proceed in a planned manner.
    In recent years, the number of delegations, art troupes, and professional delegations mutually dispatched by China and Mongolia has reached dozens. This year, China has sent more than ten delegations to Mongolia, including acrobatics, volleyball, wrestling, archery, mass culture, health, education, and artists and filmmakers. The Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe was not only warmly welcomed by people in urban and rural areas, but also performed in western border provinces that foreign art delegations had never visited before. Mongolian filmmakers even filmed the acrobatic troupe's performances into a documentary. Mongolia also sent cultural, sports, news, and acrobatic art delegations to China for visits this year.
    In Mongolia, we saw Mongolian actors performing the Chinese opera "The White-Haired Girl," and China also adapted the famous Mongolian opera "Three Mountains" into a Peking opera. This year, filmmakers from both countries decided to shoot a large-scale documentary to record the profound and developing friendship between the two peoples. The filming in Mongolia has been completed and will soon begin in China.
    Mutual Help and Mutual Support
    According to the "Agreement on Economic and Technical Assistance from the People's Republic of China to the Mongolian People's Republic" signed by the government delegations of China and Mongolia in Ulaanbaatar in 1956, China provides free assistance to Mongolia in constructing brick factories, thermal power plants, wool textile factories, glass factories, vegetable farms, stadiums, and urban roads, suburban highways, bridges, and other construction projects in Ulaanbaatar. For more than two years, Chinese employees, with the assistance of the Mongolian people, have been successfully completing these construction projects. To date, most of the construction projects have been completed and handed over for use.
    Each handover ceremony of Chinese aid projects has formed a moving scene of Sino-Mongolian friendship and is unforgettable. The brick factory was the first construction project handed over for production this year. On the day of the handover, despite the drizzle and muddy roads, Mongolian party and government leaders and factory workers participating in the ceremony enthusiastically braved the rain to visit the factory's ring kiln, soil storage, and welfare facilities. Mongolian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Maidar, gave a high evaluation of the completion of the brick factory at the opening ceremony. He said, "This is a concrete manifestation of the fraternal assistance of the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government to Mongolia. This factory will play an important role in completing Mongolia's three-year construction plan."
    In October, snow had already begun to fall in Mongolia. On the day that the "Peace Bridge" and other highways and bridges were handed over for use, it happened to be a snowy day, but the excitement of the Ulaanbaatar masses crowded on the bridge to celebrate the opening of this overpass made them forget that they had already accumulated a layer of snowflakes on their bodies. When a train passed through the bridge hole towards Beijing, and cars simultaneously traveled smoothly on the bridge, people cheered.
    Not long ago, several construction projects such as the stadium, gymnasium, and vegetable farm were successively handed over. Mongolian party and government leaders Tsedenbal, Damba, and Sambu attended the completion celebrations and carefully visited each construction project.
    The Mongolian people are also supporting China's socialist construction. This year, when China's agricultural production was making great leaps forward, the Mongolian people donated 15,000 draft horses to China, fully expressing their concern and support for China's socialist construction. These horses came from various provinces in Mongolia, and many horses had to travel thousands of miles across the grasslands to the receiving stations. The Chinese personnel who went to the Mongolian pastoral areas to inspect the horses were warmly received by the herdsmen. Some herdsmen voluntarily brought their horses, expressing their desire to donate them to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. Last year, the herdsman Lagcha from Khuvsgul Province led a golden horse to the Chinese horse inspectors, expressing his desire to give it to Chairman Mao, and also attached a letter, which read: "Respected Chairman Mao Zedong, I wish you good health and longevity, and I wish you greater achievements in leading the great Chinese socialist construction!" This fully demonstrates the deep friendship of the Mongolian people towards the Chinese people.
    The draft horses donated by Mongolia to China this year have been distributed to the suburbs of the Chinese capital and the rural areas of northern and southern provinces, and have played a role in agricultural production. Recently, the Mongolian "Unen" newspaper published a letter of thanks from the shores of Dongting Lake in China. This was sent by the Qianlianghu Farm in Hunan. The letter said: "After the farm accepted the 260 healthy horses donated by Mongolia free of charge, after careful feeding and training, pulling plows and carrying goods, they have become an indispensable force for the farm." The letter expressed deep gratitude for the internationalist spirit of the Mongolian people.
      Unforgettable Friendship
    We felt the deep friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples especially deeply when we interviewed in Mongolian cities and villages. Take the East Gobi Province as an example. The grasslands here are closely connected to the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, and the herdsmen on the border help each other. They cooperate in digging wells, fighting wolves, and using pastures for the winter, enhancing livestock production. In the past two years, after discussions between government representatives of the two countries, the two sides have successively moved hundreds of thousands of livestock to each other's countries for grazing, and have received condolences and support from the governments and people of both countries. The leaders of the East Gobi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China once visited Mongolian herdsmen wintering there in the Inner Mongolia grasslands, and held joint celebrations with the herdsmen of the two countries. The First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of East Gobi Province, Tselebsanba, said that he and some leaders of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have become old friends. In the eastern grasslands of Mongolia bordering China, we visited herdsmen from the Hulunbuir Grassland in China who came to Mongolia for the winter.
    On a lush grassland, more than 4,000 pregnant ewes of Inner Mongolian herdsmen were overwintering. Thanks to the help of the Mongolian people, not a single animal was lost in the winter, and they became fat and strong. At that time, it was the lambing season for ewes, and some of the lambs that had already been born were all strong, with a survival rate of 99%. The herdsmen said that they were safe during the winter and the lambing was safe. When they came there were more than 4,000 livestock, and when they go back there will be more than 8,000. The friendship of the brotherly Mongolian people is unforgettable.

    中蒙人民友谊的花朵
    本报记者  彭逢烨
    经济文化合作日益发展
    中蒙两国人民是近邻，有着传统的亲密友谊。1952年，我国周恩来总理和蒙古部长会议主席泽登巴尔在北京签订了中蒙经济及文化合作协定，大大加强了两国经济和文化合作的关系。最近几年来，通过两国人民的友好访问，相互支援，更加巩固和加深了两国人民的友谊。
    先从几个数字看。从1951年起，中蒙两国贸易往来日益扩大，贸易额逐年增长。如果以1956年的贸易额和1951年相比，便增加了七点八倍。1958年又比1957年增长10％以上。在蒙古，无论是在城市或者广阔的牧区，到处都可以看到从中国进口的绸缎、布匹和生活日用品。著名的蒙古马出口到我国的数量也不少；1951年以来，通过两国贸易关系，蒙古已经供应我国十五万多匹马，有力地支援了我国的农业生产。
    在文化合作方面，自1954年以来，两国文化部门每年都签订了文化合作计划，使中蒙两国的文化交流有计划的进行。
    几年来中蒙双方相互派出的代表团、艺术团和专业代表团等，各达几十起。今年，中国到蒙古访问过的有杂技、排球、摔跤、射箭、群众文化、卫生、教育以及美术家、电影工作者等十多起代表团；武汉杂技团不仅受到城乡人民的热烈欢迎，还曾到外国艺术代表团从没有去过的西部边境各省演出。蒙古电影工作者并且把杂技团的演出，拍成了纪录影片。蒙古今年也派出文化、体育、新闻和杂技艺术代表团到我国进行访问。
    在蒙古，我们曾经看到蒙古演员们演出我国的歌剧“白毛女”，我国也曾把蒙古著名歌剧“三座山”改编成京剧上演。今年两国电影工作者为了纪录两国人民的深厚的、发展着的友谊，决定拍摄一部大型纪录片，在蒙古的拍摄工作已经结束，即将在我国进行拍摄工作。
    相互帮助、相互支援
    根据1956年中蒙两国政府代表团在乌兰巴托签定的“关于中华人民共和国给予蒙古人民共和国经济和技术援助的协定”，中国无偿地帮助蒙古建设砖瓦厂、火力发电厂、毛纺织厂、玻璃厂和蔬菜农场、运动场以及乌兰巴托市内道路、市郊公路、桥梁等建设项目。两年多来，中国员工在蒙古人民的协助下，顺利地完成着这些建设项目。到目前为止，大部分建设项目都已完工，并且移交使用。
    中国援助项目的每一次移交仪式，都形成了中蒙友谊的动人场面，都是使人难忘的。砖瓦厂是今年移交生产的第一个建设项目。移交那天，虽然下着绵绵细雨，道路泥泞，但是参加仪式的蒙古党政负责人、工厂职工们，兴致勃勃地冒雨参观了这座工厂的轮窑、土库和福利设施。蒙古部长会议副主席迈达尔在开工生产的庆祝会上，对砖瓦厂的建成，给予很高评价。他说，“这是伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府对蒙古的兄弟般的援助的具体表现，这座工厂对完成蒙古的三年建设计划任务，将起重要作用”。
    10月间，蒙古已开始飘雪。“和平桥”和其他公路、桥梁移交使用那天，正赶上是个下雪天，但是为庆祝这座跨线桥通车而拥在桥头上的乌兰巴托的群众们，兴奋的情绪使他们忘记了身上已经积上一层雪花。当一列火车穿过桥孔向北京方向驶去，汽车同时在桥上畅行的时候，人们都欢腾起来。
    不久以前，运动场、体育馆和蔬菜农场等几个建设项目继续移交，蒙古党政领导人泽登巴尔、达姆巴、桑布等同志都出席了完工庆祝会，并且仔细地参观了每一个建设项目。
    蒙古人民同样地支援着我国的社会主义建设。今年正当我国农业生产大跃进的时候，蒙古人民赠送我国一万五千匹耕马，充分表达了对我国社会主义建设的关怀和支持。这些马匹来自蒙古各省，许多马匹要走过千里草原送到接收站去。我国到蒙古牧区去验马的人员，受到牧民们的热情款待。有些牧民们自动把马匹牵来，表示要赠送给毛主席和中国人民。去年，库苏古尔省的牧民拉格查，把一匹金黄色的马牵到中国验马人员那里，表示要送给毛主席，同时还附上一封信，信中写道：“敬爱的毛泽东主席，祝您安康长寿，并祝您在领导伟大中国社会主义的建设事业中，获得更大的成就”。这充分表现了蒙古人民对我国人民的深厚情谊。
    今年蒙古赠送给我国的耕马，已经分布到我国首都郊区和北方、南方各省的农村中，并且在农业生产中发挥了作用。最近，蒙古“真理报”刊登了一篇来自中国洞庭湖滨的感谢信。这是湖南钱粮湖农场寄来的。信中说：“农场接受了蒙古无偿赠给的二百六十匹健马以后，经过精心饲养和教练，拉犁驮运，已经成为农场一支不可缺少的力量”。信里对于蒙古人民的国际主义精神，表示了深深的谢意。
      难忘的友情
  中蒙两国人民之间的深情厚谊，我们在蒙古的城市和乡村采访的时候，体会尤其深刻。以东戈壁省为例吧。这里的草原和中国内蒙古自治区的草原紧紧相连，而且边境上的牧民互相帮助，他们合作打井、打狼、和利用草场过冬，增进了牧业生产。近两年来，经两国政府代表商谈后，双方曾先后把十几万头牲畜移到对方国境放牧，并且得到两国政府和人民的慰问和支援。东戈壁省和我国内蒙古自治区的负责人就曾经在我内蒙草原慰问到那里过冬的蒙古牧民，并和两国牧民举行联欢活动。东戈壁省的省委第一书记策勒布桑巴说，他和内蒙古自治区的一些负责人已经成为老朋友了。在蒙古和我国接壤的东部草原上，我们曾经访问过我国呼伦贝尔草原来到蒙古过冬的牧民们。
    在一块牧草繁茂的草原上，我国内蒙古牧民的四千多头怀胎母羊在那里过冬过春。由于蒙古人民的帮助，一个冬天没有损失一头牲畜，而且增加了膘肥。那时正是母羊产羔的时候，已经接产的一部分羊羔，只只健壮，成活率达99％。牧民们说，安全过冬，安全产羔，来时是四千多头牲畜，回去就是八千多头了。兄弟的蒙古人民的友谊是难忘的。
