    Offering Gifts to the Party Congress, Preparing for the Seven-Year Plan
    Many Soviet Economic Regions Complete This Year's Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Our newspaper Moscow, December 19th dispatch: The National Economic Committees of 105 economic regions in the Soviet Union are leading their subordinate industrial enterprises to strive to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and to meet the larger-scale production tasks of next year (the first year of the Seven-Year Plan). These days, news of completing this year's production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it has been coming from all over the Soviet Union. Up to now, the economic regions of Moscow City and Oblast, Leningrad, Gorky, Pinsk, Kirov, and Yaroslavl Oblasts have successively completed their annual production plans half a month ahead of schedule and overfulfilled them.
    The labor production competition movement initiated by the Soviet people to welcome the 21st Party Congress has spread throughout the country, and the production enthusiasm is particularly high. More than 400 industrial enterprises in the Moscow City Economic Region completed the annual plan 13 days ahead of schedule, producing products with a total value of approximately 60 billion rubles. Its total output increased by 7% compared to last year. The Moscow Oblast Economic Region completed its production plan half a month ahead of schedule, with a total output increase of 10% compared to last year. The Leningrad Economic Region produced extra steel, electric motors, machine tools, cement, silk, and other products worth 165 million rubles beyond the plan.
    This year, industrial enterprises in various regions have generally seen further improvements in labor productivity due to the realization of production specialization, the widespread adoption of new technologies, and the improvement of labor organization. According to statistics from the economic regions of Moscow City and Oblast, Leningrad, and Gorky Oblasts, labor productivity has increased by approximately 7% compared to last year. At the same time, industrial enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Ukraine, the Urals, Gorky, Kirov, and other economic regions have produced hundreds of highly productive new machines and production equipment this year. The Moscow City Economic Region produced approximately 1,200 kinds of new machines, including giant high-speed electronic computers, automated production equipment, new trucks with strong traction, ZIL-157 new-style sedans, televisions, textiles, and so on. The Moscow Oblast and Leningrad Economic Regions also each produced approximately 600 kinds of new machines, which meet the production needs of the highly developed Soviet national economy. This year, industrial enterprises in various economic regions have installed various advanced technological devices for automated mechanization.
    Significant achievements have also been made in reducing costs and saving resources. The Moscow Oblast Economic Region saved more than 600 million rubles for the country beyond the plan by reducing production costs.
    The Moscow City Economic Region saved 8,000 tons of steel, 1,000 tons of non-ferrous metals, more than 60,000 tons of fuel, and 135 million kilowatt-hours of electricity by reducing waste products and minimizing non-productive expenses. As a result of cost reductions, the country saved more than 800 million rubles.
    The workers and staff members in various regions who have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it are being inspired by the magnificent Seven-Year Plan and are striving with full confidence to complete the 1959 production tasks.

    向党代表大会献礼  为七年计划做准备
    苏联许多经济区提前完成今年计划
    本报莫斯科19日电  苏联一百零五个经济区的国民经济委员会正领导着所属的工业企业争取提前超额完成今年的生产计划，并迎接明年（七年计划第一年）更大规模的生产任务。这些天，全苏各地纷纷传来提前超额完成今年生产计划的捷报。到目前止，已有莫斯科市、州，列宁格勒、高尔基、平兹、基洛夫、雅罗斯拉夫里等州的经济区，都先后提前半个月超额完成了全年生产计划。
    苏联人民为迎接二十一次党代表大会而发起的劳动生产竞赛运动遍及全国各地，生产劲头特别大。莫斯科市经济区的四百多个工业企业提前十三天完成全年计划，生产了总值约六百亿卢布的产品。它的总产量比去年提高7％。莫斯科州经济区提前半月完成生产计划，总产量比去年提高了10％。列宁格勒经济区超计划生产了价值一亿六千五百万卢布的钢材、电动机、机床、水泥、绸缎等产品。
    今年各地工业企业由于实现了生产专业化，广泛采用新技术，改善了劳动组织，因此劳动生产率普遍地有了进一步提高。据莫斯科市、州、列宁格勒、高尔基等州经济区统计表明，劳动生产率比去年都提高7％左右。同时，这一年莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌克兰、乌拉尔、高尔基、基洛夫等经济区的工业企业制出了成百种高度生产力的新机器与生产装备。莫斯科市经济区生产出了一千二百种左右的新机器，其中包括巨型高速电子计算机、自动化生产装置、牵引力强大的新型卡车、兹尔157新式轿车、电视机、纺织品等等。莫斯科州、列宁格勒经济区也各生产出了六百种左右新机器，这些机器满足了苏联国民经济高度发展的生产需要。这一年各地经济区工业企业都差不多安装了自动化机械化的各式先进技术装置。
    在减低成本节约资源方面，也获有显著成绩。莫斯科州经济区由于减低生产成本，为国家超计划节约了六亿多卢布。
    莫斯科市经济区就减少废品和缩小非生产开支，节省了钢铁八千吨、有色金属一千吨、燃料六万多吨和电力一亿三千五百万度。而由于成本降低，又为国家节省了八亿多卢布。
    提前超额完成了今年生产计划的各地职工们，正为宏伟的七年计划所鼓舞，信心百倍地为争取完成1959年生产任务而努力。
