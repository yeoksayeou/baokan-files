People Call Us "Clever Girls"
By Song Chou'er, National Women Activist Representative, Mi'shan Township, Jincheng County, Shanxi

I am an ordinary rural girl. Along with Wang Leping and Li Chunhua, we actively responded to the Party's call to learn everything and delve into every field. We contributed our share to the construction of a new socialist countryside. The masses gave us tremendous encouragement, affectionately calling us "Clever Girls." When it comes to cleverness, we don't think we deserve the title. We can only say that we can lend a hand in all kinds of tasks at home, in the fields, on the threshing floor, and in the machine shop: deep plowing, close planting, seed soaking, seed mixing, weeding, seedling setting, vegetable planting, pollination; beekeeping, tree grafting, pig raising, chicken raising; well digging, canal opening, water and soil conservation; embroidery, sewing, flour figure making; making ball bearings, steel smelting, operating flower pressing machines, and operating power-driven grinding machines. We delve into anything we learn, and once we learn it, we use it. After using it, we delve into it again. Studying culture and enjoying entertainment are also things we love to do. The facts tell us that only through labor and struggle can we learn real skills.

You Can't Do Without Technology
Our hometown, Mi'shan Village in Gaoping, is a dry and arid mountainous area. In the past, the entire village of more than 3,000 people had only three wells for drinking water. People had to queue up to carry water all year round. Not to mention irrigating the fields and growing vegetables, even drinking water was a big problem. So, to eat vegetables, we had to go to the Dian Village, more than 20 li away, to buy them. The year before last, the village established an advanced cooperative and decided to dig wells to turn dry land into paddy fields so that we could grow our own vegetables. This was a great thing, but some people made sarcastic remarks: "No one has ever heard of Mi'shan being able to dig wells and grow vegetables. These people now, they're really trying to draw water from a dragon's back, just blindly messing around." When the cooperative wanted to draw four people from each team to dig wells, one young man from our team signed up. The three of us also discussed it together: "We are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, let's sign up too!" But the conservatives said: "Men can't even do it, what can you women do? You really don't know how much you can eat." We thought to ourselves: We'll see! With the Party branch's support, there's nothing we can't accomplish. The three of us volunteered to dig a well. At this time, it was still very cold, but our hearts were warm. With bare arms and rolled-up trousers, we dug three zhang deep in the frozen, hard ground. We had a lot of enthusiasm, but the well shaft was not straight. It either bent east or turned west, which was really frustrating. At this time, the captain said to us: "Building socialism cannot rely solely on enthusiasm. You can't do it without technology." This sentence was really to the point. From then on, whenever we had time, we would go to the old farmer "Wan Baoquan," who had technical skills, to learn technology. We learned and then we worked. If we couldn't do it, we would study it together. After a few days of hard work, we learned the complete set of well-digging techniques. We could do everything from binding frames, building wells, and lowering platforms. When clear water came out of the well, we were extremely happy, and the villagers were also happy. Everyone was overjoyed. The villagers gave us a thumbs up and praised us: "Hey! Women in the new society are not simple."

First Time Eating Vegetables We Grew Ourselves
As soon as the well-digging was finished, the cooperative formulated a water conservancy plan: "Transform barren ravines into paddy fields without spending a penny of the state's money," to turn the 360-foot-long barren mountains into paddy fields. We thought, the wells have been dug, but the vegetables have not been planted. If we're going to do it, we'll do it to the end. So, we immediately joined the cooperative's water conservancy army. We cut mountains and split ridges, blocked the barren ravines, diverted the floodwaters, and then dug stones and soil from the riverbed to level the ground layer by layer. After a few days of hard fighting, we finally turned a harmful ravine into fifteen mu of flat and even terraced fields. As soon as it was built, someone said: "Just watch! That's a flood ditch. Even if you fill it up, it won't count for anything. As soon as it rains, it will definitely roll stones down." Sure enough, two days after completion, there was a heavy rain. We couldn't stand by and watch the flood wash away our hard work. Braving the heavy rain, the three of us held hands and rushed to the top of the mountain. At this time, the water had already washed out a four-zhang-long and three-chi-deep gully. We forgot the cold, and even more so, we forgot the tiredness. We all jumped into the water until all the water was diverted into the canals, and then we felt relieved. In the autumn, fourteen mu of cabbage yielded 100,000 jin, and one mu of corn yielded 1,200 jin. The villagers ate the vegetables they grew themselves for the first time and said happily: "Nao the barren ravine in the spring, reap a great harvest in the autumn. With Clever Girls, there's nothing to worry about."

After the cabbage was harvested, it had to be supplied to the whole village. Who would sell it? The people of Mi'shan didn't have their own garden plots. They could only buy vegetables, not sell them. No one wanted to do this street-vending job. Come on, the three of us loaded the cabbage onto the cart. Some pushed and some pulled, and we went to the street. "Women selling vegetables? That's rare!" As soon as we got to the street corner, big and small, old and young, people gathered around the cart while saying this. This made us flustered and covered in sweat. After a busy day, we were still short of money at night. The men said: "Saying you can't do it, you just can't do it." The next day, we found a trick: one person watched the stall, one person weighed the vegetables, and one person calculated the accounts and collected the money. It was clear and accurate, not even a mao short.

Learn Whatever You Do, Create Miracles in Everything
"Wan Baoquan" is always our good teacher. With his help, the three of us and some young people planted the first high-yield field in the whole cooperative. Then, in half a month, we learned how to operate power-driven grinding machines and created a new record. In the past, it took three jin of oil and 300 jin of coal to operate it for a day. Later, it only took two jin of oil and 200 jin of coal to do a good job. We also learned how to repair machines. During the great tool reform, we jointly organized a technical research group. From last winter to now, we have created 32 tools, including earth trains, bulldozers, high-line earth transport machines, and granular fertilizer machines, all of which are ingenious, easy to use, and highly efficient. During the great ball bearing campaign, we jointly created a ball bearing cutting machine, which is particularly efficient.

In September of this year, the whole Party and the whole people were engaged in a great steel-making campaign. Chunhua and I were the first to sign up, leading more than 100 women to the Hegang Iron Plant to smelt iron. In just two days, we found the key to iron smelting and also took on three apprentices. With the approval of the Party committee, eight of our women individually contracted a local furnace. I went to consult the old technician Li Songbai. He said, "Chou'er, don't think you are a Clever Girl. If this line of work is successful, the sun will really have to rise from the west." What to do? I learned from practice. I watched and asked questions by the iron smelting furnace. Later, I simply took a mat and slept next to his furnace. He watched the fire color, and I also watched the fire color. Anyway, I learned everything he did. After two days of hard work, I learned his skills. On the third day, we started to load the furnace ourselves, and the first furnace produced 400 jin. When the iron flowers bloomed in the furnace, each of our hearts blossomed with red flowers. We were extremely happy. Since then, the output of our furnace has been increasing day by day. After the end of the steel battle, the whole factory evaluated 36 models, of which women accounted for 16. Chunhua became the head of the propaganda section, and I also became the deputy director of the iron smelting plant.

    人家叫我们“巧姑娘”
    全国妇女积极分子代表山西晋城县米山乡  宋丑儿
    我是个普通的农村姑娘。我和王乐平、李春花三个人，积极响应党的号召，样样学，行行钻，在建设社会主义新农村中，出了一份自己应该出的力量，群众给了我们莫大的鼓励，亲切地叫我们“巧姑娘”。要说巧，我们还觉得称不起，只能说，在深翻、密植、浸种、拌种、锄苗、定苗、种菜、授粉；养蜂、接树、养猪、养鸡；打井、开渠、水保水利；剪花刺绣、裁缝、堆花；捣滚珠、炼钢铁、蹬压花机、开锅驼机，等等的家里、地里、场上、机房的各种活计都能插上手。我们要学就钻，一钻就会，会了就用，用了再钻。学文化，闹娱乐，也是我们心爱的事。事实告诉我们，只有从劳动中、斗争中，才能学到真正的本领。
    没有技术不能行
    我们家乡高平米山村，是一个又干又旱的山地方。全村三千多口人，在以前，只有三眼吃水井，常年四季担水排队，不说浇地种菜，就连人吃水也是个大问题，所以要吃菜，就得到二十里以外的店村去买。前年春天，村里办起了高级社，决定打水井，让旱地变水田，自己种菜自己吃。这是一件天大的好事，可是有的人说风凉话：“祖祖辈辈就没听说过米山能打井种菜，现在这些人哪，真是龙背上取水，瞎胡干。”当社里要各队抽四个人打井的时候，我们队里有一个青年小伙子报了名。我们三个也在一块商量：“咱们是共产党员、共青团员，咱们也报名干！”可是保守派找下说的啦：“男人还不行，你们妇女还逞什么能？真是不知道自己能吃几碗干饭”。我们心里想：不信，咱们就走着看！党支部支持我们，就没有办不成的事。我们三个自报要包打一眼井。这时候，天还很冷，可是我们心里是热的，露着胳膊，挽着裤腿，在那冻得坚硬的地上，一股劲就打了它三丈深。干劲挺大，可就是井筒打不直，不弯东就拐西，真是着急人。这时队长对我们说：“建设社会主义不能光凭热情，没有技术还不行。”这句话真是一针见血。从那会起，我们一有空就找有技术的老农“万宝全”学技术，学了就干，干不成大家就一块研究。苦钻了几天，我们学会了全套打井技术，绑架、垒井、落盘什么都能干。当井里打出了清水的时候，我们高兴极了，社员们也高兴，大伙乐成了一团。社员们伸出大姆指称赞说：“嘿！新社会的妇女就是不简单”。
    第一次吃到自己种的菜
    打井的事刚完，社里又订了一个“荒沟变水田，不花国家分文钱”的水利计划，要把三百六十尺长的荒山旱岭修成水田。我们想，井打成了，可是菜没种上，要干就干到底，所以马上就参加了社里的水利大军。我们削山劈岭，堵住荒沟，使洪水改道，又从河床启石挖土，层层垫平。几天苦战，终于把一条害沟，变成了十五亩又平又齐的梯田。才修起就有人说：“看吧！那是一条洪水沟，填平也不算，一下雨准叫它滚石头。”说也担心，刚完工两天，就下了一场大雨。我们不能眼看着叫洪水冲走自己的血汗，冒着大雨，我们三个手拉手，赶到山头。这时水已经把地冲开了一条四丈长、三尺深的大水沟，我们忘记了冷，更忘记了累，一齐跳进了水里，直到将水全部引进了渠道，才放心。这块地在秋后十四亩白菜收下了十万斤，一亩玉茭打下了一千二百斤。社员们第一次吃到自己种的菜，高兴地说：“春天闹荒沟，秋后大丰收，有了巧姑娘，样样不发愁”。
    白菜收回后，要供给全村人吃，谁去卖呢？米山人自己没有园子地，是只能买菜，不能卖菜，这个沿街叫卖的事谁也不愿干。来吧，还是俺们三个把白菜装上车子，推的推，拉的拉，就上了大街。“妇女卖菜？真稀罕！”才走到街口，大大小小、老婆老汉，一边说着就围满了车子。这一下就把我们闹了个手忙脚乱，满头是汗。忙了一天，晚上还差了账。男人们说：“说你们不行，就是不行。”第二天我们找了个窍门：一个人看摊子、一个人称菜、一个人算账收钱，一清二楚，分毛不差。
    干啥学啥样样创奇迹
    “万宝全”什么时候也是我们的好老师。在他帮助下，我们三个和一些青年种出了全社第一块高额丰产田。接着，我们在半个月里学会了开锅驼机，并且还创造了新纪录。以前开起来一天要用三斤油、三百斤炭，后来只用二斤油、二百斤炭就干的满好。我们还学会了修理机器。在大闹工具改革时，我们又一块组织了技术研究小组，去冬到现在创造了三十二件工具，有土火车、推土车、高线运土机、颗粒肥粒机等，样样都是灵巧好用效率高。大闹滚珠轴承时，我们又一起创造了滚珠切料机，效力特别高。
    今年9月，全党全民大搞钢铁。我和春花首先报了名，领着一百多个妇女，便去贺岗铁厂炼铁。只两天，我们就找到了炼铁窍门，还带了三个徒弟。经党委批准，我们有八个妇女单独包一个土方炉。我去请教老技工李松柏，他说，“丑儿，别看你是巧姑娘，要是这一行干成了，真得太阳要从西面出来。”这怎么办呢，我就从实际中学习，在炼铁炉旁，看、问，后来我就干脆拿了条席子，睡到他的炉旁边，他看火色，我也看火色，反正他做啥我学啥，下了两天苦功，就把他的本事给学走了。第三天，我们就开始自己装炉，第一炉就炼出了四百斤。炉里开铁花，我们个个心里开红花，真高兴极了。从此，我们这个炉子的产量，一天天往上长。钢铁战役结束后，全厂评比了三十六个模范，其中妇女就占了十六个。春花做了宣传股长，我也当上炼铁厂的副厂长了。
