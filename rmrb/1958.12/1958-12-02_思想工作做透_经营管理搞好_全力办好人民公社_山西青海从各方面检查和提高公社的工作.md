    Do Thorough Ideological Work  Manage Operations Well
    Strive to Run People's Communes Well
    Shanxi and Qinghai Inspect and Improve the Work of Communes from All Aspects
    (Our Taiyuan Dispatch, December 1) Shanxi Province's rural areas have begun a comprehensive campaign to rectify, consolidate, and improve people's communes. Currently, the province's one hundred-plus pilot rectification communes and some areas that started rectifying communes earlier have seen new atmospheres in the communes' production and lives. The Jin Southeast Special District (formerly Changzhi Special District), combined with the autumn harvest final accounting, carried out rectification work on autumn harvest distribution and financial clearing. At the same time, it further established a new set of management methods based on the new situation after the establishment of people's communes. The CPC Licheng County Committee, starting in mid-September, organized more than 400 financial accounting personnel and fully mobilized commune members to conduct a preliminary rectification of financial work, bringing about a new situation of "leadership satisfaction, cadre satisfaction, and commune member satisfaction" in the financial work of the county's eleven people's communes. At the end of last month, the Jin South Special District convened cadres from the rectification pilot work groups to specifically study the problems and experiences in the rectification work, and also convened a county party secretary meeting to specifically deploy the work of comprehensively rectifying communes. Currently, the rectification work in the entire district is rapidly unfolding. Yanbei and other regions have also formulated rectification plans and started taking action. According to the person in charge of the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee, a high tide of commune rectification activities will be formed in the province's rural areas in early December.
    In September, Shanxi Province's rural areas transitioned from over twenty thousand agricultural cooperatives to over six hundred people's communes. At that time, due to the iron and steel production campaign and the busy autumn harvest work, many specific tasks of the communes could not be arranged in time. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee has deployed the work of rectifying and consolidating communes to various localities, requiring that during the four months from December to March next year, the overall consolidation and improvement of communes be achieved through the rectification of various tasks of the communes.
    In order to do a good job in commune rectification, the local rectifications will be combined with rural party rectification work, continuing to carry out socialist and communist ideological education, and universally inspecting and appraising the work style of rural cadres during the Great Leap Forward. The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee is currently preparing to form an inspection team of more than six thousand people, ensuring that each commune has an average of ten cadres to specifically lead the rectification work. In addition, in addition to mobilizing more than seven hundred rural accounting instructors throughout the province to rectify commune finances, a number of instructors will also be seconded to serve as commune chief accountants.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 1st: The CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee held a telephone conference on November 29th, determining that from now until the start of spring plowing next year, a large-scale rectification of people's communes and a large-scale winter production campaign will be carried out in the vast agricultural and pastoral areas. The participants in this telephone conference included the heads of provincial-level agencies and the party and government leaders of various prefectures, cities, and counties.
    The meeting pointed out: Since the realization of people's communes was immediately followed by a mass iron and steel smelting campaign and a crash autumn harvest movement, there was not enough time to properly address the organizational structure, management system, collective living welfare, and other aspects of the people's communes. Therefore, the party committees at all levels must regard the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the people's communes as a major current political task, mobilize the entire party and the entire people, and strive to run the people's communes well to promote a greater leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production.
    The meeting believed that in rectifying people's communes, we should first grasp ideological work and raise the political awareness of all commune members. It called for a comprehensive upsurge in the ongoing socialist and communist education movement. By using the method of everyone propagandizing and everyone receiving education, we should mobilize the masses to thoroughly discuss the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between the collective and the state, and establish a strong communist style of honesty, selflessness, and mutual support.
    Secondly, we should grasp the rectification of the management and operation of people's communes. In this regard, the most pressing issues currently needing resolution are the system of people's communes, labor organization and labor management, this year's distribution work, and collective living welfare. The meeting believed that labor organization should be universally militarized. According to the tasks of industrial, agricultural, pastoral production and basic construction, large-scale corps operations and specialized teams should be combined. At the same time, we must resolutely implement the policy of running communes democratically, combine organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization with management democratization, and establish a regular democratic management system. Each commune and brigade should also formulate annual and quarterly labor plans and make good arrangements for labor. Labor and rest should also be well arranged, and commune members must be guaranteed eight hours of sleep each day. In terms of distribution, we should do our best to enable the vast majority of commune members to increase their income, and pay special attention to those with strong labor power. The meeting emphasized that doing a good job in collective living welfare undertakings, especially public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, are several major current events, and party committees at all levels must attach importance to and do this work well.
    The meeting pointed out that in conjunction with rectifying people's communes, we should also universally rectify party organizations within the communes and pay attention to absorbing new party members in order to strengthen the party's combat power.
    The meeting then pointed out that the rectification of people's communes must be closely combined with current production, resolutely implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," universally organize specialized teams for water, fertilizer, and soil, work hard this winter and spring, and fully prepare and create conditions for a bumper harvest in agriculture next year by doing a good job in the five major tasks of deep plowing, water conservancy, fertilizer, tool reform, and seed selection.
    In order to do the above work well, the meeting required that party committees of each prefecture, city, and county draw a large number of cadres and go deep into communes and brigades to carry out work. At the same time, it required that the party committees of each prefecture, city, and county select a commune as a key point, with the first secretary personally taking action to create a set of experiences. The Provincial Party Committee also decided to draw a group of cadres from provincial-level agencies, including provincial party secretaries, vice governors, and department and bureau chiefs, to form an inspection team to go to various prefectures, cities, and counties to assist in the work. The inspection team personnel will be departing separately soon.

    思想工作做透  经营管理搞好
    全力办好人民公社
    山西青海从各方面检查和提高公社的工作
    本报太原1日电  山西省农村开始全面进行整顿、巩固和提高人民公社。目前，全省一百多个整顿试点公社和一些进行整顿公社较早的地区，公社的生产、生活都出现了新的气象。晋东南专区（原长治专区）结合秋收决算，进行秋收分配和清理财务的整顿工作，同时，根据人民公社建立以后的新情况，进一步建立一套新的管理方法。中共黎城县委9月中旬开始组织了四百多个财务会计人员，并充分发动社员，把财务工作作了初步整顿，使全县十一个人民公社的财务工作出现了“领导满意、社干满意、社员满意”的新局面。晋南专区已在上月底召集各整社试点工作组干部专门研究了整社工作中的问题和经验，又召集县委书记会议，专门部署了全面整顿公社的工作，目前全区整顿公社工作正在迅速开展。雁北等地区也都制定出整社方案，开始行动起来。据中共山西省委负责人谈，12月初旬全省农村整社活动即将形成高潮。
    山西省农村9月间由两万数千个农业社转建成六百多个人民公社，当时由于钢铁生产上了马，三秋工作处于繁忙时期，公社许多具体工作没有来得及安排。最近省委向各地布置了整顿、巩固公社的工作，要求从12月起到明年3月四个月期间，通过对公社各项工作的整顿，来全面巩固和提高公社。
    为了作好公社整顿工作，各地整社将与农村整党工作结合进行，继续开展社会主义、共产主义思想教育，普遍检查鉴定农村干部在大跃进中的工作作风。中共山西省委现在正筹备组成六千余人的检查团，做到每个公社平均有十个干部，具体领导整社工作。另外，除调动全省七百多个农村会计辅导员整顿公社财务外，同时还将抽调一部分辅导员担任公社总会计职务。
    新华社西宁1日电  中共青海省委11月29日召开电话会议，确定从现在起到明年春耕开始以前，在广大农牧业区开展一次大规模的整顿人民公社工作和大搞冬季生产。参加这次电话会议的有省级机关各部门和各州、市、县党政负责人。
    会议指出：由于实现人民公社化以后，立即掀起了一个全民炼钢铁和突击秋收运动，所以在人民公社的组织机构、管理制度、集体生活福利等方面都没有来得及很好地抓。因此，要求各级党委必须把整顿、巩固、提高人民公社作为当前的一项重大政治任务，要动员全党、全民，全力办好人民公社，推动工农牧业生产更大跃进。
    会议认为：在整顿人民公社时首先应抓思想工作，提高全体社员的政治觉悟。要求把正在进行的社会主义和共产主义教育运动全面推向高潮。通过人人作宣传、人人受教育的方法，发动群众鸣深辩透个人与集体、集体与国家的关系，树立起坚强的老老实实、大公无私、互相支援的共产主义风格。
    其次应抓整顿人民公社的经营管理工作。在这方面目前最迫切需要解决的有人民公社的体制、劳动组织和劳动管理，今年的分配工作以及集体生活福利等问题。会议认为劳动组织要普遍实行军事化。根据工农牧业生产和基本建设任务，要使大兵团作战和专业队相结合。同时必须坚决贯彻执行民主办社的方针，使组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化和管理民主化结合起来，建立起经常的民主管理制度。各公社和大队还要制定全年和季度劳动计划，很好安排劳动力。对于劳动和休息也要很好安排，必须保证社员每日睡够八小时。在分配方面要尽力使绝大多数社员能够增加收入，特别要注意劳力强的人。会议强调指出，办好集体生活福利事业特别是公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院，是当前的几件大事，各级党委必须重视和作好这一工作。
    会议指出，各地结合整顿人民公社，还要普遍整顿社内的党组织，注意吸收新党员，以增强党的战斗力量。
    会议接着指出：整顿人民公社必须与当前生产密切结合，坚决贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，普遍组织水、肥、土专业队，大干一冬春，充分做好深翻、水利、肥料、工具改革和籽种五件大事，给明年的农业丰产做好一切准备和创造条件。
    为了作好上述工作，会议要求各州、市、县抽调大批干部，深入公社、大队进行工作。同时，要求各州、市、县党委要选择一个公社作为重点，由第一书记亲自动手，搞出一套经验来，省委并决定从省级机关抽调一批包括省委书记、副省长和部、局长在内的干部，组成检查团，分赴各州、市、县去帮助工作，检查团的人员即将分别起程。
