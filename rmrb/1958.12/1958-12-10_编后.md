Editor's Note

The vigorous development of new folk songs has attracted widespread attention. In recent months, many articles on new folk songs have been published in literary journals, some with differing opinions, mainly regarding the relationship between new folk songs and new poetry, and the development path of new poetry. Some opinions hold that the folk song form has limitations when expressing modern life and that it is necessary to establish a new metrical form. Others disagree. Today, the article by Comrade Lu Xuebin, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while mainly discussing the further development of the new folk song movement based on the experience of some areas in Anhui Province, also touches upon the views on new folk songs and the folk song form, which are inconsistent with some current opinions. We welcome poets, critics, and readers to participate in the discussion.

Comrade Mei Lanfang's article, "Using Traditional Techniques to Portray Modern Characters," raises the issue of further improving operas reflecting modern life in terms of performing arts. Through continuous efforts, opera workers in various regions have created many new repertoires, some of which have been welcomed by the masses. However, in scriptwriting, performing arts, as well as music and stage art, there are still many issues worth exploring that require summarizing experience. Only in this way can modern repertoires achieve greater success in ideology, artistry, and performance techniques. We hope comrades in the drama and literary and art circles will participate in this discussion.

    新民歌的蓬勃发展引起了广泛的注意。几个月来，文艺刊物上发表了许多关于新民歌的文章，其中有一些分歧的意见，主要是关于新民歌和新诗的关系、新诗的发展道路问题。有的意见认为民歌体在表现现代生活的时候有限制，有必要建立新的格律体。也有人不同意这样的意见。今天，这里发表的中共安徽省委宣传部长陆学斌同志的文章，虽则主要是根据安徽省部分地区的经验来谈新民歌运动的进一步发展的问题，但也涉及了对新民歌、民歌体的看法问题，而与当前有些意见是不一致的。我们欢迎诗人、批评家和读者来参加讨论。
    梅兰芳同志的“运用统传技巧刻划现代人物”一文，就表演艺术方面提出了进一步提高反映现代生活的戏曲问题。各地戏曲工作者经过不断的努力，创作了不少新剧目，有的受到了广大群众的欢迎。但是在剧本创作和表演艺术，以及音乐和舞台美术等方面，还存在着不少值得探讨的问题，需要总结经验，这样才能使现代剧目在思想性、艺术性和表演技巧方面获得更大的成就。我们希望戏剧界、文艺界的同志来参加这个讨论。
