To ensure the complete supply of power station rolling mill equipment, the State Planning Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and other units held a meeting to arrange next year's production.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch,

In order to promote the high-speed development of the electrical machinery industry and adapt to the new situation of the whole people running industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, after successively holding eleven on-site meetings on power generation equipment, recently jointly convened the Northeast Regional Complete Power Station Equipment Meeting with the Northeast Economic Coordination Zone Office in Harbin. At the same time, a meeting was held in Beijing with the participation of five coordination zones in North China, Southwest China, Northwest China, Central China, and South China, focusing on the study and arrangement of the complete production and supply of power station equipment next year.

After analyzing the situation of the whole people running iron and steel and running industry on a large scale, the meeting pointed out that the supply of electrical equipment required for power, smelting, and rolling steel is currently extremely tight. Although the electrical machinery industry has repeatedly worked overtime, it still cannot meet the demand. This requires that power generation equipment next year increase even more than this year, and general electrical products should also increase accordingly.

The meeting pointed out that power station equipment covers a wide range and many varieties, and it must be organized for complete production to play its role. At present, due to insufficient power supply, general attention has been paid to the manufacture of power generation equipment, while not enough attention and arrangements have been given to the manufacture of a large number of auxiliary machines. The weak links in the complete production of main engines are boilers and steam turbines, the weak links in the complete production of auxiliary machines are thermal instrumentation and high and medium pressure valves, and the weak links in the complete production of electrical products are high-voltage electrical porcelain, wires and cables, and insulating materials. The meeting emphasized that each province (city) must promptly make comprehensive arrangements to address these weak links in order to provide complete sets of power station equipment.

In the past, auxiliary machines required for power stations were organized for production by more than 80 mechanical and electrical factories across the country. Inconvenient transportation and overly complex cooperative relationships can no longer adapt to the current situation. In order to effectively arrange the complete production of auxiliary machines and organize complete supply, the meeting believed that complete production and supply should mainly rely on self-reliance, with large-area complete sets as the mainstay, and strengthen cooperation between large areas to make up for deficiencies. Since organizing complete production is a very complex and arduous task, each province (city) should establish organizations for complete sets as soon as possible to be responsible for organizing complete work.

According to the situation that the speed of capital construction in the electrical machinery industry this year cannot yet meet the requirements of production development, the meeting believed that the principle of simplicity, phased construction, and simultaneous construction, trial production, and production should be implemented, and measures of "using small instead of large, using indigenous methods instead of foreign methods, self-reliance, and self-manufacturing" should be taken to break through the key to insufficient equipment supply, accelerate the construction of new factories, and put them into production as soon as possible to play their role.

The meeting analyzed the relationship between key and general issues, and pointed out that the two key areas of Northeast China and Shanghai will undertake more than two-thirds of the manufacturing tasks of power station equipment next year, and the whole country will strongly support it, which is of decisive significance for realizing the great leap forward in the electrical machinery industry and solving the urgently needed power station equipment in various places. General areas should make contributions according to their capabilities; key areas should support the whole country with the spirit of putting others before themselves. In short, key and general issues should promote each other and complement each other. In addition to determining that the power station equipment transferred from the Northeast region should be responsible for complete supply, the Northeast China meeting also stipulated that certain supporting products mainly produced in the region, such as large transformers, high-voltage circuit breakers, relays, explosion-proof switches, cables, insulating materials, and electrical carbon products, should also share a part of the task of supporting the whole country.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd, The National Rolling Mill Professional Conference held in Beijing ended on November 30th. This seven-day meeting reviewed the production of rolling mill equipment this year, deployed the production tasks of rolling mill equipment for the first quarter of next year, and pushed the battle to manufacture rolling mill equipment to a new stage, requiring all regions to rush to manufacture a batch of medium-sized and large rolling mill equipment to equip China's steel industry and produce various large steel materials to support the rapid development of various departments of the national economy.

The staff and workers of mechanical manufacturing factories in various places, on the basis of having achieved major victories in rushing to manufacture smelting equipment such as iron-making and steel-making equipment, immediately turned to the intense battle of rushing to manufacture rolling mill equipment from the beginning of October. According to statistics from the First Ministry of Machine Building, as of November 21, 100 sets of rolling mill equipment have been manufactured nationwide. Judging from the situation reported by various places, the speed and quantity of manufacturing rolling mill equipment are still accelerating and increasing sharply. It is expected that the rolling mill equipment manufactured throughout the year will surely greatly exceed the original plan.

In view of the fact that most of the rolling mill equipment manufactured this year is small rolling mills that can only roll wire, the meeting required all regions to rush to manufacture a batch of medium-sized and large rolling mills in the first quarter of next year to arm the steel industry to roll steel rails and various shaped steel, and support the rapid development of various departments of the national economy. Among the rolling mill equipment arranged for manufacturing in various places in the first quarter of next year, there are rail beam rolling mills with an annual output of 800,000 tons of steel rails or large steel materials, and complete sets of large seamless steel pipe rolling mills consisting of 72 sets of machines. The plan determined by the meeting shows that the battle to manufacture rolling mill equipment in various places is about to enter a new stage, not only being able to manufacture a large number of small rolling mills, but also being able to manufacture medium-sized and large rolling mill equipment in batches.

In order to quickly manufacture rolling mills, ensure that the manufactured rolling mill equipment is complete, and that it can be installed and put into production immediately after being manufactured, the meeting made proper and specific arrangements for issues related to the design of rolling mills, the production of large blank parts of rolling mills, and the complete set of rolling mills. After visiting and discussing, the representatives attending the meeting broke the superstitious idea that small factories cannot produce large blanks for rolling mills, and found the experience of using electroslag welding to "turn the large into small and piece together the large from the small" to produce large blanks. While studying and determining the plan for manufacturing medium-sized and large rolling mill equipment, various regions also jointly negotiated with factories related to the complete set of rolling mills, and also determined the production plans for supporting equipment such as motors, control devices, and ball bearings. Some cooperative units jointly responsible for manufacturing a set of rolling mill equipment have all formulated unified plans and common progress to ensure that the rolling mill equipment is manufactured quickly and completely.

This National Rolling Mill Professional Conference was jointly held by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Metallurgical Industry. Representatives from provincial, municipal, and autonomous region machinery bureaus and metallurgical bureaus, factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Railways that undertake the task of manufacturing rolling mill equipment, as well as representatives from large motor factories, ball bearing factories, switch factories, and other supporting factories, totaling more than 280 people from more than 140 units, attended the meeting.

    保证电站轧钢设备成套供应
    国家计委、一机部等单位召开会议安排明年生产
    本报讯  为了促进电机工业高速度发展，以适应全民办工业的新形势，第一机械工业部在陆续召开了发电设备等十一个现场会议以后，最近又和东北经济协作区办公厅在哈尔滨共同召开了东北区成套电站设备会议，同时在北京召开了华北、西南、西北、华中、华南五个协作区参加的会议，着重就明年电站设备的成套生产成套供应问题进行了研究和安排。
    会议在分析了全民大办钢铁大办工业的形势以后指出：目前电力和冶炼、轧钢所需电器设备的供应极为紧张。电机工业虽一再加班，仍然未能满足需要。这就要求明年的发电设备较今年更多地增长上去，一般电工产品也要相应地增长。
    会议指出，电站设备包括的范围很广，品种繁多，必须成套组织生产才能发挥作用。现在因电力供应不足，一般是重视了发电设备的制造，而对大量的辅机制造没有予以足够的重视与安排。主机配套生产中的薄弱环节是锅炉和汽轮机，辅机配套生产中的薄弱环节是热工仪表和高中压阀门，电工产品配套生产中的薄弱环节是高压电瓷、电线电缆和绝缘材料。会议强调指出，各省（市）必须针对这些薄弱环节，从速进行全面安排，以便成套供应电站设备。
    过去电站所需辅机是由全国八十多个机电工厂来组织生产的，运输不便，协作关系过于复杂，已不能适应今后的形势。为了有效地安排辅机的成套生产，组织成套供应，会议认为，配套生产供应主要靠自力更生，以大区自行成套为主，并通过大区之间加强协作以补不足。由于组织配套生产是一项十分复杂而又繁重的任务，各省（市）都应尽快地把组织配套的机构建立起来，负责组织配套的工作。
    根据今年电机工业基本建设速度还不能适应生产发展要求的情况，会议认为，应该贯彻因陋就简，分期建设和边基建边试制边生产的方针，并采取“以小代大、以土代洋、自力更生、自己制造”的办法，来突破设备供应不足的关键，以加快新厂建设，使其及早投入生产，发挥作用。
    会议对于重点和一般的关系问题进行了分析，并指出东北、上海两个重点地区明年承担三分之二以上的电站设备制造任务，全国大力予以支持，对实现电机工业大跃进的任务和解决各地急需的电站设备有决定意义。一般地区要各就所能，作出贡献；重点地区应以先人后己的精神，支援全国。总之，要使重点和一般相互促进相辅相成。东北地区会议上除了确定调出的电站设备要负责成套供应外，并且规定目前以该区为主生产的某些配套产品，如大型变压器、高压断路器、继电器、防爆开关、电缆、绝缘材料、电碳制品等，也要分担一部分支援全国的任务。
    新华社2日讯  在北京召开的全国轧钢机专业会议11月30日结束。这个历时七天的会议，检查了今年轧钢设备的生产情况，部署了明年第一季度轧钢设备的生产任务，把制造轧钢设备的战斗推向一个新的阶段，要求各地赶制一批中型和大型轧钢设备装备我国钢铁工业，生产各种大型钢材支援国民经济的各个部门飞速发展。
    各地机械制造工厂的职工们，在赶制炼铁炼钢等冶炼设备已经取得重大胜利的基础上，紧接着又从10月初开始转入突击赶制轧钢设备的紧张战斗。据第一机械工业部统计，全国到11月21日止，已经制成轧钢设备一百套。从各地汇报的情况看来，制造轧钢设备的速度和数量，还在日益加快和猛烈增长，预计全年制造的轧钢设备，有把握大大超过原定计划。
    会议针对今年制造的轧钢设备中，多数是只能轧制线材的小型轧钢机，要求各地在明年第一季度突击赶制一批中型和大型轧钢机，用来武装钢铁工业轧制钢轨和各种型钢，支援国民经济各个部门飞速发展。明年第一季度各地安排制造的轧钢设备中，有年产八十万吨钢轨或大型钢材的轨梁轧机，有由七十二组机器组成的全套大型无缝钢管轧机。会议确定的计划表明，各地制造轧钢设备的战斗，即将开始进入一个新的阶段，不仅能够大量制造小型轧钢机，而且能够成批制造中型和大型轧钢设备。
    为了迅速把轧钢机制造出来，所制造的轧钢设备都能成套，制成后就能马上安装起来投入生产，会议对于轧钢机的设计，轧钢机大部件毛坯生产和轧钢机配套问题等有关问题，都做了妥善而具体的安排。参加会议的代表经过参观和讨论，破除了小厂不能生产轧钢机大毛坯的迷信思想，找到了采用电渣焊办法“化大为小、以小拼大”生产大毛坯的经验。各地在研究确定制造中型、大型轧钢设备计划的同时，都同与轧钢机配套有关的工厂共同协商，把电动机、控制装置、滚珠轴承等配套设备的生产计划也确定下来。共同负责制造一套轧钢设备的一些协作单位，都制订有统一的计划和共同的进度，确保迅速成套的把轧钢设备制造出来。
    这次全国轧钢机专业会议，是由国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、第一机械工业部、冶金工业部共同召开的。出席会议的有省、市、自治区机械局和冶金局，第一机械工业部、冶金工业部、铁道部所属承担制造轧钢设备任务的工厂，以及大型电机厂、滚珠轴承厂、开关厂等配套工厂的代表，共计一百四十多个单位二百八十多人。
