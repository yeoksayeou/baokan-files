    Livestock in Gannan Doubled
    (Our dispatch) Under the radiant light of the Party's ethnic policies, animal husbandry in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is advancing at a high speed. In the years since liberation, the state has issued loans of over 928,800 yuan and relief funds of over 1,318,800 yuan, while the pastoral tax collected is only 1,058,400 yuan, less than half of the state's loans and relief funds. At the same time, efforts have been vigorously carried out in veterinary prevention and treatment and livestock breeding, and the purchase prices of livestock products have been increased, which has increased the production enthusiasm of herdsmen, making the total number of livestock more than double that before liberation. In Woburi Village, Shangkajia Township, Xiahe County, 36 households lacked food and clothing in 1951, but by 1957, every household was well-fed and clothed. In 1951, the village had 620 sheep, 141 cattle, and 14 horses, while by 1957, it had 1,000 sheep, an increase of 61%, 330 cattle, an increase of 136%, and 28 horses, an increase of 100%.
    Due to the development of production and the improvement of living standards, the political consciousness of the broad masses of herdsmen has been continuously enhanced, and they actively support the Party's various policies. People's communes have been realized here, breaking the grazing boundaries of the grasslands, rationally utilizing the grasslands, and creating conditions for settlement and group grazing. Veterinary hygiene stations have been established, and since September, more than 600,000 head of livestock have been treated and prevented from diseases, which is 50% more than the livestock treated and prevented during the first Five-Year Plan period.

    甘南牲畜增加两倍
    本报讯  在党的民族政策光辉照耀下，甘南藏族自治州的畜牧业高速猛进。解放几年来国家发放贷款九十二万八千八百多元，救济款一百三十一万八千多元，而所收的牧业税仅为一百零五万八千四百多元，还不到国家发放贷款和救济款的二分之一。同时还大力开展兽医防治和增畜保畜工作，提高了畜产品收购价格，这就提高了牧民的生产积极性，使牲畜总头数比解放前增加两倍多。夏河县上卡加乡窝不日村，1951年有三十六户缺吃少穿，而到1957年户户丰衣足食。1951年该村有羊六百二十只，牛一百四十一头，马十四匹，而到1957年有羊一千只，增加61％，牛三百三十头，增加136％，马二十八匹，增加100％。
    由于生产的发展和生活的改善，广大牧民的政治觉悟日益提高，积极拥护党的各项政策。这里已经实现了人民公社化，打破了草原的放牧界限，合理利用草原，给定居、分群放牧创造了条件。成立了兽医卫生所，从9月份起，防治的牲畜达六十多万头，比第一个五年计划期间防治的牲畜还多50％。
