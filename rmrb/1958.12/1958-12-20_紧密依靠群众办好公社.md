    Relying Closely on the Masses to Run the People's Commune Well
    Yang Yucui, Head of Xiaozhang Commune, Luxi County, Hunan Province

    The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes" made by the Party Central Committee at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee clearly pointed out: "The working method of the Party's mass line is the lifeblood of the people's communes; without the mass line, without the full trust of the masses in the Party and the People's Government, without the high tide of revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, the establishment and consolidation of the people's communes is impossible. Therefore, the leading staff at all levels of the commune must thoroughly implement the mass line in any work." These words of the Party Central Committee really touched my heart. From my own experience in the past few years, I have realized that promoting democracy and following the mass line is really too important!

    From the land reform work to the establishment of mutual aid teams in 1952, and then to the elementary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, and finally the establishment of people's communes in September this year, I have always tried my best to rely on the masses and persuade and mobilize the masses to work together. Because the Party has educated me and made me realize that one person has only one pair of hands and one mouth. No matter how capable you are, one pair of hands cannot catch a thousand fish, and only a few people will listen to what one mouth says. It is impossible for one person to do everything. How can we do things for everyone and engage in collective production without relying on everyone? Everyone should handle their own affairs, and the power of the masses is greater than the sky. Therefore, in the past few years, in whatever work I have done, I have, on the one hand, relied on Party members and activists to contact the masses, work among the masses, and play a role, and on the other hand, I have also directly consulted with the masses on how to do things.

    It is not enough to rely on the masses alone; we must also educate the masses and raise their awareness and understanding. Educating the masses cannot rely solely on cadres; we must also rely on the masses to educate each other, so that it is easier to get through to each other's thinking. Only when everyone's thinking is clear will we have the energy to produce and be able to overcome difficulties more easily. If we assign a task and the masses do not understand it for a while, we cadres must understand their feelings and slowly explain the reasons to them; we cannot criticize this or that. We must treat the masses like our own relatives, be patient and considerate, and not be impatient. Cadres and the masses should be harmonious. If the villagers do not like you and are unwilling to talk to you from the bottom of their hearts, how can you do your work well? How can the commune be consolidated? Of course, being harmonious does not mean that we should not criticize. We can criticize those who really do wrong things and those who are truly bad people, but in general, those who are criticized are always in the minority.

    Following the mass line does not mean that we accept all the opinions raised by the masses. We must also carefully analyze the opinions raised by the masses. We must accept good opinions, correct our shortcomings in our work, and explain clearly incorrect opinions, because they raise them because they do not understand! We cannot criticize indiscriminately. If we criticize them, they will not dare to raise opinions next time.

    Take the affairs of our commune as an example. During the autumn plowing this year, the leaders instructed us to deep plow. The platoon leader of the second platoon of the first brigade I led did not understand, saying that the cattle were weak and that deep plowing required large water buffalo, but their platoon had yellow cattle, which would not work. The company commander could not persuade him, so I went to that platoon to hold a meeting. First, I explained the relationship between deep plowing and increased production, and then I mobilized the masses to discuss whether or not to deep plow? Can yellow cattle deep plow? What methods should be used for deep plowing? Because the masses realized that deep plowing could produce more grain, they all agreed to deep plow. Everyone said that the strength of yellow cattle is indeed weaker than that of large water buffalo, but it is not much different. As long as we find a way, we can still deep plow. Later, everyone came up with the idea of harrowing once and then plowing once, harrowing three times and plowing three times in total, so that we could meet the requirements of deep plowing. Because everyone's thinking was clear, they happily started working the next day. As a result, their platoon did the best job of deep plowing, reaching two chi and five cun, which was the best in the entire commune.

    After the establishment of the commune, each team set up canteens. Our brigade stipulated that the canteens should eat half rice and half sweet potatoes. Some canteens followed this rule, while others only ate rice and did not eat sweet potatoes, which aroused the dissatisfaction of some villagers. The cadres and masses of the fifth platoon of the second company raised many opinions to me. I immediately went down to check and found that three company canteens did not eat according to the grain and oil supply standards, so I quickly corrected them. Originally, our canteens were eating chili peppers and gourds every meal, and the masses had opinions, complaining that the dishes were ugly and little. I, on the one hand, admitted that it was a shortcoming in my work, persuaded the masses to spare some manpower to grow vegetables, radishes, cabbage, and green onions, and on the other hand, mobilized those who looked after cattle and fed pigs to take the time to catch some fish and shrimp. The problem of vegetables was solved. Now, we can eat three or four dishes every meal.

    In the past few years, my work has been able to achieve some results, our production has been able to develop day by day, and our lives have been able to improve day by day, all because under the leadership of the Party, we have persisted in following the mass line. In the future, I will definitely resolutely implement the resolution of the Party Central Committee and rely more closely on the masses to run the commune well. (Attached photo)

### 紧密依靠群众办好公社

    紧密依靠群众办好公社
    湖南泸溪县小章公社社长  杨玉翠
    党中央在八届六中全会所作的
  “关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中，明确指出：“党的群众路线的工作方法是人民公社的生命；没有群众路线，没有群众对党和人民政府的充分信任，没有群众的革命积极性的高涨，人民公社的建立和巩固是不可能的。因此，公社的各级领导工作人员，在任何工作中，都必须彻底执行群众路线。”党中央这些话真说到我的心坎里去了。从自己几年来的亲身经历中，我体会到发扬民主、走群众路线实在是太重要了！
    从土改工作开始，到1952年成立互助组，以后又是初级社、高级社，直到今年9月成立人民公社，我做工作都是尽力依靠群众、说服动员群众一齐来做的。因为党教育了我，使我认识到一个人只有一双手、一张口，不管你多么能干，一双手也不能抓千条鱼，一张口说话听的人总是有数几个，一个人什么事情都要靠自己干是不行的。给大家做工作，搞集体生产，不依靠大家怎么行？大家的事大家办，群众力量胜过天。因此，几年来，我做什么工作都是一方面依靠党团员、积极分子去联系群众，在群众当中做工作、起作用，一方面自己也直接和群众商量办事。
    不光要依靠群众，还要教育群众，提高群众的觉悟和认识。教育群众不能光靠干部，还得靠群众教育群众，大家互相教育，思想才容易搞通。只有大家思想都搞得通通的，生产起来才有劲，困难才容易克服。如果布置一个什么任务，群众一时思想不通，我们当干部的就得体会他们的心情，慢慢地向他们讲清道理；不能这也批评，那也批评。对群众就得像对自己的亲人一样，要耐烦点、体贴点，不能着急。干部和群众要和和气气的，要是社员都不喜欢你，不愿意和你谈心里话了，你的工作怎么搞得好？公社怎么能够巩固？当然，和和气气也并不是不要批评，对那些真正做得不对的事，真正不好的人也可以批评，但是，一般说来批评的总是少数。
    走群众路线，不是说群众提出的什么意见都一齐接受，对群众提出的意见也得好好分析。好的意见要接受，是我们工作中的缺点就要改正，不对的意见，要解释清楚，因为他不明白他才那样提嘛！不能乱批评，一批评，下次他有意见也不敢提了。
    拿我们公社的事情来说吧。今年秋耕的时候，领导上布置要深耕。我领导的第一大队一连二排排长思想不通，说牛力弱，深耕要大水牯牛才行，他们排是黄牛不行。连长没办法说服他，我就到那个排里开会，先讲清楚了深耕对于增产的关系，然后再发动群众讨论要不要深耕？黄牛能不能深耕？用什么办法深耕？群众因为认识到深耕能够多打粮食，都同意深耕。大家说黄牛力量是比大水牯牛弱一些，但是也差不了好多，只要想办法还是可以深耕的。后来大家想出了耙一次再犁一次，一共耙三次犁三次，就可以达到深耕的要求了。由于大家思想通了，第二天就高高兴兴的干起来，结果他们这个排深耕搞得最好，达到了二尺五，在整个公社里数第一。
    公社成立了以后，各队都办起了食堂。我们大队规定食堂要吃一半米一半红薯，有的食堂遵守了这个规定，有的食堂就光吃米不吃红薯，结果，引起了一部分社员的不满。二连五排的干部和群众都对我提了很多意见。我立刻下去作了检查，发现有三个连的食堂伙食都没有按照粮油供应标准吃，就赶快纠正过来。原来我们各个食堂都是餐餐吃辣子和瓜，群众有意见，嫌菜吃得丑吃得少。我就一方面承认是工作中的缺点，说服群众腾出一部分人手来种菜，萝卜、白菜、葱、样样都种，一方面动员看牛和喂猪的人，抽工作空隙捞些鱼虾等等。菜的问题就解决了，现在，每餐可以吃到三四个菜。
    几年来，我的工作能够做出了一些成绩，我们的生产能够一天一天发展，生活能够一天一天向上，都是由于在党的领导下，坚持了走群众路线的结果。今后我一定坚决贯彻党中央决议，更紧密地依靠群众把公社办好。（附图片）
