Xinhua News Agency, 20th - In the era of the Great Leap Forward, the arrow on statistical charts in all aspects of our country always points upward. However, the arrow indicating morbidity rates is decreasing steadily. Cholera, which had been prevalent for over a century, has been completely eradicated and no longer has a place in statistics. Plague, which once prevailed in some areas and seriously endangered people's health, was quickly brought under control by the people after liberation, and by 1956, it had been basically eliminated. Smallpox, which used to be present everywhere year after year, has now also been basically eliminated. This year, under the leadership of the Communist Party, people in various regions, with the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, eliminated the Four Pests, emphasized hygiene, vigorously prevented and controlled diseases, and carried out the patriotic health campaign more deeply, achieving even greater results on this front. This is reflected in several infectious diseases such as measles, malaria, dysentery, relapsing fever, pertussis, and typhus, where the arrows all point downward. Compared with last year, these diseases have decreased by at least 21%, and some have decreased by as much as 71.36%. On the charts, they are approaching the zero mark, and many places have found no or very few of these infectious diseases.

The patriotic health campaign of 1958 was carried out on the basis of summarizing the experiences of the past few years and the victory of the rectification movement. In this movement, local Party committee secretaries took personal command, strengthened leadership, and implemented the mass line. Therefore, the scale and momentum were unprecedented. Throughout the country, from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, from the coast to the western border, millions, tens of millions, and even hundreds of millions of people threw themselves into the movement. The characteristics of the movement were: hygiene closely combined with production, concentrated campaigns combined with regular work, treating the symptoms combined with addressing the root causes, and mass movements combined with science and technology, pushing the movement forward wave upon wave.

Millions of people were mobilized and organized, and everywhere on our vast motherland, sparrows and rats were being captured. This year, the capturing of sparrows generally involved large-scale encirclement battles using methods such as frightening, shooting, raiding nests, trapping, and poisoning. From cities to villages, unified action was taken, and a full-scale attack was launched to eliminate sparrows in batches. The broad masses were very enthusiastic about eliminating rats. Various places created a large number of rat-catching tools. According to incomplete statistics from Anhui Province alone, there were more than 170 kinds, classified into nine categories, including traps, presses, cards, clips, guillotines, awls, buckles, turnovers, and lassos. In Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, there were many large rats. In addition to house rats and field rats, many sewer rats were hidden in the city's 144 kilometers of interconnected sewers. However, under the leadership of the city's Party committee, the people of the city launched a war of annihilation against all kinds of rats. Forces were also organized to simultaneously light fires and smoke in more than 7,000 manholes leading to the sewers. After repeated battles, a total of more than 5.9 million rats were exterminated, greatly reducing the rat infestation.

For flies and mosquitoes, various places organized the masses to eliminate adult flies and mosquitoes by blocking, smoking, and trapping. On the other hand, they vigorously improved environmental hygiene, further filling pits and leveling depressions on the basis of the past few years. Many places continued to dredge ditches and build toilets and livestock and poultry pens, eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. Zhongwei County in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region used sand carried by the Yellow River to level 210,000 mu of sewage pits, which not only eliminated mosquito and fly breeding grounds but also increased building sites and farmland. In Foshan City, Guangdong Province, there used to be many "rotten lands" that were smelly and filthy. Now, after being leveled by the masses, more than 400 small gardens have been built on the rotten lands. In some rural people's communes in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces, hygiene was combined with capital construction, and indigenous tap water plants and indigenous sewers were established. Some people's communes in Shaanxi and other provinces moved livestock pens to mountain valleys or fields, and toilets and manure tanks were also renovated and managed.

In this year's patriotic health campaign, under the leadership of the Party, people in various places, while treating patients with schistosomiasis, vigorously launched a campaign to eliminate snails, the intermediate host. After Fujian Province clarified the distribution of Oncomelania hupensis, the snail host of schistosomiasis, the relevant counties mobilized 1.3 million people from March to June to go to remote mountains and valleys, climb cliffs, and trace the water system to its source, completely eliminating the breeding grounds of Oncomelania hupensis. After fifteen re-examinations since June, it has become difficult to find Oncomelania hupensis in Haicheng County. The area of snail elimination in Jiangsu Province this year is 3.4 times the total area of the past two years, and the number of schistosomiasis patients treated is nearly twice the total number of the past eight years. The disease in counties and cities where schistosomiasis is prevalent throughout the country has been greatly reduced, and 61% of the counties and cities have basically eliminated the disease this year. Malaria, which is prevalent in the south, especially in Yunnan and Guizhou, has been greatly reduced this year. Sixty-seven counties in the two provinces have become basically malaria-free counties.

The year 1959 is approaching. People in various places are carrying out health campaigns to "welcome the New Year cleanly" while continuing to carry out the patriotic health campaign in depth in all aspects, in conjunction with the greater leap forward in production next year, striving for greater victories.

    降伏病魔造福人民
    全国爱国卫生运动成绩巨大
    新华社20日讯  在大跃进的年代，我国各方面的统计图表，箭头总是向上的，但是，统计发病率的箭头却节节下降。流行了一百多年的霍乱，已经彻底根绝，统计中已没有它的地位；曾经在一些地区流行并严重危害人民健康的鼠疫，解放后人民迅速控制了它的流行，到1956年即已基本消灭鼠疫。过去到处都有连年不断的天花，现在也已基本消灭。今年，各地人民在共产党的领导下以移山倒海的气魄，除四害，讲卫生，大力防治疾病，更深入地开展了爱国卫生运动，在这条战线上取得了更大的成绩。表现在几种传染性疾病如麻疹、疟疾、痢疾、回归热、百日咳、斑疹伤寒等，箭头全部下降，和去年相比，这些疾病最少下降了21％，多的下降71.36％，图表上已接近零界线，许多地方没有或很少发现这些传染性疾病。
    1958年的爱国卫生运动，是在总结过去几年的经验和整风胜利的基础上开展的。这一运动，在各地都由各级党委书记亲自挂帅，加强领导，贯彻群众路线，所以论规模、声势都是空前的。全国从黑龙江到海南岛，从沿海到西部边疆，成百万、千万以至上亿的人群，投身到运动中来。运动的特点是：卫生密切结合生产，突击结合经常，治标结合治本，群众性运动结合科学技术，使运动滚滚向前，一浪高一浪。
    千百万人民动员组织起来了，在我们祖国辽阔的大地上，到处都在捕捉麻雀和老鼠。今年各地捕捉麻雀，一般是采取轰、打、掏、捕、毒大规模的围歼战，从城市到乡村，统一行动，全线出击，成批地消灭麻雀。对于消除老鼠，广大群众的积极性是很高的。各地创造了大量的捕鼠工具，单是安徽省不完全统计就有一百七十多种，计有关、压、卡、夹、铡、锥、扣、翻、勒等九大类。四川省重庆市的老鼠既多又大，除了家鼠、田鼠外，还在全市蛛网交错四通八达长达一百四十四公里的下水道中藏有许多沟鼠。但全市人民在市委领导下，对各种老鼠发起歼灭战，全市通向下水道的七千多个探井也组织力量同时点火熏烟，经反复战斗结果，全市共灭鼠五百九十多万只，大大减轻了鼠患。
    对于苍蝇蚊子，各地一方面组织群众用拦、熏、诱捕等办法消灭成蝇成蚊，一方面又大力改善环境卫生，在过去几年的基础上进一步填坑平洼，许多地方继续疏通沟渠，修建厕所和家畜家禽的圈窝等，消灭蚊蝇孳生场所。宁夏回族自治区中卫县利用黄河水携带的流沙，整平了二十一万亩污水坑，既消灭了蚊蝇孳生地，又增加了建筑基址和田地。广东佛山市原来有许多“烂地”，臭秽不堪，现在经群众平整，在烂地上建成四百多个小花园。在河北、浙江等省，有些农村的人民公社把卫生和基本建设结合起来，建立了土自来水厂和土下水道等，陕西等省有些人民公社把畜圈移到山沟或田头，厕所粪缸也加以整修管理。
    今年爱国卫生运动中，各地人民在党的领导下，对严重危害人民健康的血吸虫病一边救治病人，一面大力发动灭螺。福建省查清了血吸虫病的寄主钉螺分布情况以后，有关各县从3月到6月先后发动一百三十万人次，到人迹罕到的深山野谷，攀登悬岩峭壁，一直追到水系源头，彻底消灭钉螺孳生源地，海澄县6月份以后经十五次复查，已不容易找到钉螺。江苏省今年灭螺面积等于过去两年总和的三点四倍，治疗血吸虫病人数等于过去八年总和的近二倍。全国流行血吸虫病的县、市，病情已大大减轻，并有61％的县、市在今年基本消灭了这种疾病。在南方特别是云南、贵州一带流行的疟疾，今年更大大减少。两省已有六十七县成为基本无疟县。
    1959年就要来临，各地群众正一面开展卫生运动来“干干净净迎新年”，一面结合明年生产上更大的跃进，从各方面继续深入地开展爱国卫生运动，争取更大胜利。
