    Review of "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China" Volume 1
    Ke An
    We are now in an era where the socialist camp is like the rising sun, full of vibrant spring, while the imperialist camp is like the setting sun, a scene of desolation. The heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of their great helmsman—the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao—are full of vigor and high spirits, advancing towards the construction of socialism. The days when imperialism and its running dogs ran rampant in China are gone forever, and the filth and garbage they left behind are being washed away by the torrent of history. However, we must not forget the towering crimes committed by the extremely vicious imperialists in China over the past century. We should tell the broad masses of the people and our next generation about the hardships and difficulties our predecessors went through to create our cause. This will enhance hatred and vigilance against imperialism, as well as love for our great motherland. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to make a systematic narrative and analysis of the history of imperialist aggression against China. Recently, the Science Press published the first volume of the multi-volume "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China," co-authored by Ding Mingnan, Yu Shengwu, and five others, which is a very meaningful event.

    "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China" Volume 1 covers the historical period from 1840 to 1895, that is, from the Opium War to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The authors divide the process of imperialist aggression against China during this half-century into two stages. The first stage is from the Opium War in 1840 to the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution in 1864, called "the period when foreign capitalism began to invade China"; the second stage is from the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution in 1864 to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, called "the period when the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social form of China took shape and the border crisis occurred universally." This book revolves around the major events that occurred in China during these two periods and systematically narrates and exposes the crimes of imperialism and its running dogs, and also makes some analysis and exploration of the domestic and international political situation at that time and the causes and outcomes of major historical events. This allows readers to gain a clearer understanding of the ugly nature of imperialism and the feudal ruling class from history, and a more systematic understanding of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and its running dogs.

    We know that from the beginning of the Opium War, for more than a hundred years after the imperialist invasion of China, imperialism never ceased its oppression and plunder of China. From politics to economy, from culture to thought, from the coast to the interior, from cities to villages, their bloody claws stretched out everywhere. And in the process of imperialist aggression against China, it was full of intricate contradictions. Due to this situation, to settle the old historical accounts of imperialist aggression against China, it is necessary to sort out a system from a large amount of material, from the complicated national contradictions and class contradictions. The authors of "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China" have dealt with this problem relatively successfully. From this book, we can see that they have occupied and used a considerable amount of historical material, and after relatively careful selection and refinement, they have better unified the material and viewpoints, and are often able to use relatively concise and concise words to explain the origin and essence of some historical events. The main reason why this book has achieved this success, I think, is that the authors can better grasp the main contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and between feudalism and the masses of the people in modern Chinese history. In this way, it is possible to analyze and demonstrate through historical facts how imperialism gradually turned China into its semi-colony and colony, how they obstructed and devastated the development of Chinese capitalism, and how they united with the Chinese feudal ruling class to jointly open knives and exploit the Chinese people, strangling many revolutionary movements in China. It is precisely because of grasping this main contradiction that other contradictions arising therefrom, such as the contradictions between imperialist countries and the contradictions between feudal ruling classes, are also easier to analyze and understand.

    Even so, I think that this book has shortcomings in the following issues.

    First, it lacks sufficient attention and evaluation of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and its running dogs. Chairman Mao taught us: "The process of imperialism and Chinese feudalism combining to turn China into a semi-colony and colony is also the process of the Chinese people resisting imperialism and its running dogs." According to Chairman Mao's classic scientific conclusion, I think that "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China" itself should also be a history of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. The most fundamental reason why imperialism can never destroy China is that the Chinese people, rich in revolutionary traditions and lovers of peace and freedom, have always insisted on waging heroic and arduous struggles against imperialism and its running dogs. Although "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China" has given some attention to the people's struggle against imperialism, the elaboration of this issue seems weak and powerless compared with the weight of the whole book. It is precisely because of the lack of sufficient attention to this issue that it is not possible to make a strong analysis from the perspective of class essence and class struggle why the feudal rulers of the Qing Dynasty were so arrogant and brutal in front of the Chinese people, but so submissive and cowardly in front of imperialism.

    Secondly, the authors said in the "Preface" that this book "focuses more on the narrative of the political relations between foreign aggressors and China." I think that as a comprehensive "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China", the economic and cultural crimes of imperialism should not be ignored. The reason why our country is "poor and blank" and why some people still have awe of imperialism and still have superstition and illusions about imperialism is inseparable from the long-term economic and cultural aggression of imperialism against China.

    Finally, the book's exposure of the crimes of aggression by U.S. imperialism is not prominent enough and not powerful enough. U.S. imperialism is the greatest enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China" should and must use more space to thoroughly expose the crimes of aggression against China by U.S. imperialism from history, so that readers can more easily recognize its face.

    Imperialism, which once ran rampant and committed evil in China for a long time, is now stinking and discredited. History has proven and will continue to prove Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant conclusion: imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The day when they are eliminated from the earth by the people is not far away, and U.S. imperialism, before its death, has put nooses around its own neck and handed one end of the noose to the Chinese people. Read "A History of Imperialist Aggression Against China", old hatred plus new hatred, contempt plus disdain, we can easily understand what to do: tighten the noose, strangle it, eliminate it!

    评“帝国主义侵华史”第一卷
    柯安
    现在我们正处在这样一个时代：社会主义阵营如旭日东升，满园春色；帝国主义阵营如夕阳西下，满目凄凉。英雄的中国人民，正在自己的伟大舵手——中国共产党和毛主席领导下，抖擞精神，意气风发，向建成社会主义前进。帝国主义其及走狗在中国横行霸道的日子已经一去永不复返，而且他们遗留下来的污秽和垃圾，也正在被历史的洪流洗涤净尽。然而，我们也不能忘记穷凶极恶的帝国主义近百年来在中国干下的滔天罪行。我们应该告诉广大人民和我们的下一代，我们的先辈为了缔造我们的事业是经过了怎样的困苦艰辛。这将会增强对帝国主义的仇恨和警惕，以及对我们的伟大祖国的热爱。因此，对帝国主义侵略中国的历史作一番系统的叙述和分析，是完全必要的。最近，科学出版社出版了丁名楠、余绳武等七人合著的多卷本“帝国主义侵华史”第一卷，这是一件很有意义的事。
    “帝国主义侵华史”第一卷，包括了从1840到1895年，即从鸦片战争到中日甲午战争这个历史时期。作者把这半个多世纪中帝国主义侵略中国的过程划分为两个阶段。第一阶段是从1840年鸦片战争起到1864年太平天国革命失败止，叫做“外国资本主义开始侵入中国时期”；第二阶段是从1864年太平天国革命失败起到1895年中日甲午战争止，叫做“中国半殖民地半封建社会形态形成和边疆危机普遍发生时期”。这部书围绕这两个时期中国先后发生的历次重大事件，对帝国主义及其走狗的罪行进行了较有系统的叙述和揭露，对当时国内外的政治形势和历次重大历史事件发生的原因及其结局也进行了一些分析和探讨。这就使读者可以从历史上，对帝国主义和封建统治阶级的丑恶本质获得一个比较清楚的认识，对中国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的英勇斗争获得一个比较系统的了解。
    我们知道，从鸦片战争开始，帝国主义侵入中国以后的一百多年中，帝国主义没有一天停止对中国的欺压和掠夺，从政治到经济，到文化到思想，从沿海到内地，从城市到乡村，都伸进了它们的血腥魔爪。而在帝国主义侵略中国的过程中，又充满着错综复杂的矛盾。由于这种情况，要清算帝国主义侵略中国的这笔历史老账，就要从大量的材料中，从头绪纷繁的民族矛盾和阶级矛盾中，理出一个系统来。“帝国主义侵华史”的作者，比较成功地处理了这个问题。我们从本书中可以看到，他们占有和运用了相当大量的史实材料，经过了比较认真的选择和提炼，把材料和观点较好地统一起来，往往能够用比较简明扼要的文字，说明一些历史事件的原尾和本质。这部书之所以能够获得这种成功，我觉得主要的是由于作者能比较好地抓住中国近代史上帝国主义同中华民族之间、封建主义同人民大众之间的这个主要矛盾。这样，就能够通过史实来分析和论证帝国主义是怎样一步一步地把中国变为它的半殖民地和殖民地，它们是怎样地阻挠和摧残中国资本主义的发展，又是怎样地同中国的封建统治阶级联合起来，共同向中国人民开刀和压榨，绞杀中国的许多次革命运动。也正是由于抓住了这个主要矛盾，所以由此而产生其他各种矛盾，如帝国主义之间的矛盾，封建统治阶级之间的矛盾，也就比较容易分析和理解了。
    虽然这样，我认为在以下几个问题上，这部书是存在着缺陷的。
    第一，它对中国人民英勇反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，还缺乏足够的重视和估价。毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义和中国封建主义相结合，把中国变为半殖民地和殖民地的过程，也就是中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程。”根据毛主席的这个经典性的科学论断，我认为“帝国主义侵华史”本身，同时就应该是一部中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的斗争史。帝国主义之所以永远不能灭亡中国，最根本的原因，就是富有革命传统和酷爱和平自由的中国人民，自始至终都坚持向帝国主义及其走狗进行了英勇卓绝的斗争。“帝国主义侵华史”虽然对人民反抗帝国主义的斗争给了一定的注意，但是对这个问题的阐述同全书的分量比起来，却是显得薄弱和无力的。正是由于对这个问题缺乏足够的重视，因此，对清朝的封建统治者为什么在中国人民面前那样耀武扬威、凶残肆虐，而在帝国主义面前为什么又是那样俯首贴耳、怯懦无能，也就不能从阶级本质和阶级斗争的观点上进行有力的分析。
    其次，作者在“弁言”中说，这部书“比较侧重于外国侵略者与中国之间的政治关系的叙述”。我认为作为一部综合性的“帝国主义侵华史”，对帝国主义在经济上、文化上的侵略罪行，也是忽略不得的。我们国家之所以“一穷二白”和直到现在还有人对帝国主义怀着敬畏心理，还对帝国主义抱有迷信和幻想，这就是同帝国主义对中国长期的经济和文化侵略分不开的。
    最后，这部书对美帝国主义侵略罪行的揭露还不够突出，不够有力。美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界人民的最大敌人，“帝国主义侵华史”应该而且必须用更多的篇幅，对美帝国主义的侵华罪行从历史上进行彻底的揭露，使读者更便于认清它的面目。
    曾经在中国长期横行作恶的帝国主义，现在已经是臭不可闻了，威风扫地了。历史已经证明并将继续证明毛泽东同志的英明论断：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。它们被人民从地球上消灭的日子已经不会很远了，而美帝国主义在垂死之前，又自己把一条条绞索套上了自己的脖子，并把绞索的一端交给了中国人民。读读“帝国主义侵华史”，旧恨加新仇，鄙视加藐视，我们不难明白应该怎么办：拉紧绞索，绞死它，消灭它！
