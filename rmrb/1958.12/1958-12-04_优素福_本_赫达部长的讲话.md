Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd

We are very happy to set foot on the land of the great People's Republic of China today.

We are very pleased to meet the heroic Chinese people. We thank the Chinese government for its invitation, which gives us this rare opportunity to be close to the Chinese people who are so close to us, so sympathetic to our suffering, and so strongly supportive of our struggle.

The Algerian people are engaged in a heroic struggle against a cruel enemy supported and armed by Western imperialism. The Algerian people know that the Chinese people are on their side. The recognition of the Algerian people's national government by the great People's Republic of China has inspired and encouraged the Algerian people. The friendly ties forged between the two peoples in the fierce and exciting battles will be strengthened day by day.

The heroic Chinese people once fought against imperialist rule and exploitation; but the Chinese people are not satisfied with liberating themselves. The Chinese people are striving for the liberation of the Asian and African countries that are still enslaved by imperialism. As the main creator of the Bandung Charter, the Chinese people are doing their best to ensure that all peoples share freedom and happiness.

The Algerian people deeply admire the Chinese people who continue to fight against all forms of imperialist rule and exploitation.

The unity of the people of all countries to fight together for freedom, justice and peace is the best guarantee for the happiness of mankind.

The Chinese people, under the guidance of their leaders with lofty prestige, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, are enthusiastically engaged in peaceful construction. This is not only for the happiness of the great Chinese people, but also a contribution to the happiness of the whole world.

The Algerian people are closely watching the great achievements made by the friendly Chinese people. Today, everyone has seen that the great People's Republic of China is becoming increasingly prosperous and is realizing the happiness of all its people.

The Algerian people are also eager to create a peaceful and prosperous future for their children. As you all know, the imperialists who have been carrying out colonial plunder in Algeria for more than one hundred and twenty-five years are still trying to prevent the Algerian people from enjoying a peaceful and prosperous future.

In the past four years, one out of every eighteen Algerians has sacrificed their lives for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The Algerian people are willing to pay and will continue to pay all costs, because they firmly believe that their struggle is a struggle for survival, freedom and peace.

The great Chinese people, like the Algerian people, have fought and supported the heroic struggle of the Algerian people. In the struggle, our people once again pay brotherly respect to the great Chinese people and the wise leaders of the Chinese people. May this visit to your beautiful country help strengthen and consolidate the friendly and cooperative ties between our two peoples.

    优素福·本·赫达部长的讲话
    我们今天踏上伟大中华人民共和国国土，感到非常喜悦。
    我们很高兴能和英勇的中国人民见面。我们感谢中国政府对我们的邀请，使我们有这样难得的机会来同和我们这样亲近、那么同情我们的苦难并大力声援我们的斗争的中国人民接近。
    阿尔及利亚人民正在同受到西方帝国主义支持和武装的残酷的敌人进行英勇的斗争，阿尔及利亚人民知道中国人民是站在他们这一边的。伟大中华人民共和国承认阿尔及利亚人民的全国政府，使阿尔及利亚人民感到振奋鼓舞。两国人民在激烈的激动人心的战斗中铸成的友好联系将日益加强。
    英勇的中国人民曾为反对帝国主义统治和剥削而进行了斗争；但是中国人民并不满足于解放自己。中国人民正在为争取仍然受帝国主义奴役的亚非国家获得解放而奋斗。作为万隆宪章的主要缔造者，中国人民尽力谋求各国人民同享自由和幸福。
    阿尔及利亚人民对继续为反对一切形式的帝国主义统治和剥削而斗争的中国人民深为敬佩。
    各国人民的团结一致，为自由、正义与和平协力进行斗争，是人类幸福的最好的保证。
    中国人民，在自己的具有崇高威望的领袖们的指导下，在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，正在热情充沛地从事和平建设。这不仅是为了伟大中国人民的幸福，也是对全世界的幸福作出了贡献。
    阿尔及利亚人民密切注视着友好的中国人民所取得的巨大成就。今天人人都已经看到，伟大的中华人民共和国日益繁荣昌盛、正在实现全民的幸福。
    阿尔及利亚人民也迫切地希望为自己的儿女缔造和平和繁荣的前途。你们都知道，在阿尔及利亚进行了一百二十五年以上的殖民掠夺的帝国主义者，还妄图阻止阿尔及利亚人享有和平和繁荣的前途。
    在过去四年之中，每十八个阿尔及利亚人中就有一个为祖国的自由和独立而献出了自己的生命。阿尔及利亚人不惜付出并将继续不惜付出一切代价，因为他们坚信不疑，他们自己的斗争是争取生存、自由与和平的斗争。
    伟大的中国人民像阿尔及利亚人民一样进行过斗争并且支持阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，在斗争中的我国人民，再一次向伟大的中国人民和中国人民的英明领导人致以兄弟般的敬意。愿我们对你们的美丽的国家的这次访问，将有助于加强和巩固我们两国人民的友好和合作联系。  （新华社3日讯）
