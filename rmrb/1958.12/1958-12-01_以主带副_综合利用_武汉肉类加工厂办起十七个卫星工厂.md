Taking the Main Line and Utilizing Comprehensively
Wuhan Meat Processing Plant Establishes Seventeen Satellite Factories

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 30th) Following the principle of comprehensive and repeated utilization of resources, the Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Plant mobilized the masses to establish satellite factories on a large scale, gradually developing the enterprise towards comprehensive production. Currently, the plant has established seventeen satellite factories and successfully trial-produced seventy-six new products, eleven of which have reached advanced international standards.
    The factory first focused on the many by-products of pigs, such as internal organs, endocrine glands, blood, hair, and skin, all of which are important medicinal and industrial raw materials. They mobilized the masses to make full use of everything from the pig's head to its tail, from its skin to its internal organs and even manure. They also proposed a two-year plan to achieve "zero cost for white meat," meaning that the cost of the pig could be entirely recovered solely through the repeated utilization of the pig's by-products, making the white meat all surplus without any cost.
    Currently, the products they have put into production include artificial blood serum, hemoglobulin, peptone, liver extract injections, liver concentrate, liver paste, and artificial gastric juice for medicinal purposes, and gelatin, bone meal, toothbrush bristles, cleaned casings, and leather for industrial purposes. Products that have been successfully trial-produced include tannic acid protein, mild silver protein, cholesterol, lung powder, spleen powder, testicle powder, liver residue soy sauce, activated carbon, and pig hair yarn. This greatly increases the use value and economic value of pig by-products. For example, artificial blood serum can replace human blood in medical treatment, and its therapeutic effect is even better. Gelatin can be used to manufacture photographic film and high-grade glue for printing. Peptone is an important raw material for antibiotic factories, which used to be imported from abroad. Twenty kilograms of pig blood can only be sold for two yuan, but after being made into peptone, it is worth eighteen yuan, increasing the output value by eight times. Currently, the value recovered by the factory from various by-products is equivalent to 43.6% of the cost of the pig. According to their plan, they will manufacture hundreds of medicines.
    The factory is also further finding ways to utilize all useful resources in the factory. In the past, they directly used broken rice and rice bran to feed pigs, but now they have changed to first using broken rice to make maltose, then using the sugar residue to brew wine (sugar skin is also used to brew wine), and finally using the distiller's grains to feed pigs. In the past, a lot of straw was used as padding in pigsties and vehicles, which was easy to cause fires when used for burning and would obstruct sanitation if discarded outside, making it difficult to handle. Now, they use all this straw to make paper and also improve environmental sanitation. According to their plan, they will also build biogas digesters, using the large amount of pig manure, sewage, and waste from the factory to produce biogas, and then use the biogas to singe pig skin and drive cars, and use the pig manure, which has improved fertilizer efficiency, as fertilizer. They are also building a cannery and plan to use the scrap iron left over from the cannery to make buttons and children's toys.
    At the same time, they are also tapping the potential of the plant's equipment, developing the repair workshop and power workshop into meat processing machinery factories, which have now produced blowers, crushers, and lathes; the automobile repair team has been developed into an automobile repair factory, which has undertaken part of the automobile repair business in the city. They have also built a cement kiln to serve the basic construction of the plant according to the needs of their business development, established four small blast furnaces, and are building a water plant to solve the water problem for the plant and nearby residents, and are preparing to build a glass factory to solve the supply of medicine bottles after the increase in pharmaceutical production.
    In the large-scale establishment of satellite factories, the factory implemented the mass line, handing over many satellite factories to the workshops to run. The masses in the workshops automatically found ways to overcome difficulties and quickly produced products. For example, the Second Processing Workshop automatically proposed (no equipment, no people), and by setting up a few large vats themselves, they turned pig skin into leather. Running satellite factories requires labor, and the feeding workshop has tapped potential three times this year, adjusting the labor organization, changing from twenty-four people needed to care for every five thousand pigs to sixteen people, and then to seven people. The entire workshop was also reduced from nine hundred and thirty-two people to six hundred and twenty-three people, and then to three hundred and fifty-eight people. The remaining people were transferred to run satellite factories, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor. (Attached picture)

### 以主带副  综合利用  武汉肉类加工厂办起十七个卫星工厂

    以主带副  综合利用
    武汉肉类加工厂办起十七个卫星工厂
    本报武汉30日电  武汉肉类联合加工厂根据将资源综合利用、反复利用的方针，发动群众大办卫星工厂，使企业逐步朝综合生产的方向发展。现在，该厂已办起十七个卫星工厂，试制成功七十六种新产品，其中有十一种达到了国际先进水平。
    这个工厂首先针对猪的副产品很多，如内脏、内分泌腺和血、毛、皮等都是重要的医药原料和工业原料，发动群众从猪的头到尾，从皮到内脏、粪便，都全部利用起来。他们还提出了两年做到“白肉无成本”的计划，意思是单靠对猪的副产品反复利用，便能将猪的成本全部收回，白肉就全部成了盈余，没有成本。
    现在，他们已经投入生产的产品，在医药方面有人造血清、血原质、蛋白胨、肝精注射液、肝原质、肝膏和人造胃液等，在工业方面有明胶、骨粉、牙刷料毛、净肠衣和皮革等。已经试制成功的，还有柔酸蛋白、弱蛋白银、胆固醇、肺粉、脾脏粉、睾丸粉和肝渣酱油、活性炭、猪毛绒线等。这样就使猪副产品的使用价值和经济价值都大大提高。如人造血清可在医疗中代替人血，而疗效比人血还好。明胶可用来制造照像胶卷和印刷用的高级胶。蛋白胨是抗生素厂的重要原料，过去要从国外进口。二十公斤的猪血只能卖两元，制成蛋白胨后，就值十八元，提高了产值八倍。该厂目前从各种副产品回收的价值，已相当于猪的成本的43.6％。按照他们计划，他们将制造上百种药品。
    这个工厂还进一步设法将工厂有用的资源都利用起来。他们过去是直接用碎米、糠皮喂猪，现在已改为先用碎米制饴糖、再用糖渣酿酒（糖皮也酿酒），最后才用酒糟喂猪。过去，猪圈和车船上垫稻草很多，用来升火易发生火灾，丢在外边又妨害卫生，很难处理。现在，他们都将这些稻草用来造纸，并结合搞好了环境卫生。按照他们的计划，还要建立沼气池，用厂里大量的猪粪、污水、废物来制造沼气，然后将沼气用来燎猪皮、开汽车，将提高了肥效的猪粪当做肥料。他们还在建造罐头厂，并准备将罐头厂用剩的碎铁皮制成钮扣和儿童玩具。
    与这同时，他们还挖掘本厂设备潜力，将修理工段和动力工段发展为肉类加工机械厂，现时已制出鼓风机、碎石机和车床等；将汽车修理小组发展为汽车修理工厂，已承担起市内一部分汽车修理业务。他们还根据自己业务发展的需要，建起了一座为本厂基本建设服务的水泥窑，建立了四座小高炉，并正在建设自来水厂，以解决本厂与附近居民的用水问题，准备建立玻璃厂，以解决医药生产增多后的药瓶供应问题。
    这个工厂在大办卫星工厂中，贯彻了群众路线，把许多卫星厂都交给车间去办。车间群众都自动想办法克服困难，很快就制出产品来。如第二加工车间自动提出（不要设备，不要人），由自己设法安了几个大缸，便将猪皮制成了皮革。办卫星工厂需要劳动力，饲养车间就在今年三次挖掘潜力，调整劳动组织，由过去每五千头猪需二十四人照料，改为十六人照料，再改为七人照料，全车间也由九百三十二人减为六百二十三人，再减为三百五十八人。剩下的人都调来办卫星工厂，解决了劳力不足的困难。（附图片）
