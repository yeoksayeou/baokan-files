The Qingdao Municipal Drama Troupe performed a play for the representatives of the National Youth Activists Conference called "People Who Dare to Think and Act." I was also in the audience. The protagonist's daring to think and act on stage resonated with the audience below, who were also bold thinkers and doers. The applause and laughter from the stage and audience blended together, creating a beautiful picture of the new China and the new era!

"People Who Dare to Think and Act" depicts the story of young carpenters Zhang Yingjie and Yao Eryong, who want to start a technical revolution by inventing an electric butt-joint machine. After many failures and overcoming numerous difficulties, they finally succeed with the support of the Party, greatly increasing production.

This is a very ordinary story, but the script is well-written and the acting is very touching. The author captures an important aspect of life. The difficulties and obstacles encountered by the protagonist do not come from outside, but from their own families, colleagues, and direct leaders, namely Director Wan and Secretary Wang of the workshop. They are also revolutionaries and good comrades, but they suppressed even better comrades. The play correctly reveals and explores the contradictions within the people, the contradictions between the advanced and the backward, the innovative and the conservative. The development of the contradictions gradually becomes more acute, eventually reaching a point of irreconcilability, yet their shared revolutionary stance remains unaffected. I believe this very natural and appropriate handling is where the success of the script lies.

In particular, the portrayal of Director Wan leaves a lasting impression. His mental state and words and actions evoke laughter from the audience from time to time, but without aversion. He has a good catchphrase: "You don't understand, do you!" This extremely common phrase is very prominent in the play, clearly illustrating his attitude towards difficulties: not to overcome them bravely, but to feel wronged and misunderstood. People with this kind of conservative thinking often regard what is incorrect as correct, and what is correct as incorrect when solving problems; they only understand after learning a lesson. The typical character of Director Wan certainly has real-world educational significance.

In addition, the author did not take a simplistic approach to the handling of Chief Engineer Jiang. At first, he praised the workers' inventions and creations, but his attitude changed when he encountered specific difficulties. Finally, through practical education, he changed back again. This double transformation vividly reveals the spiritual outlook of a kind-hearted elderly intellectual.

This play not only writes about the workers' inventions and creations but also touches on a bigger question: whether workers who are currently mainly engaged in physical labor can also become intellectual laborers. Some people, represented by Director Wan, do not believe this is possible. They are met with resolute resistance from young workers Zhang Yingjie, Yao Eryong, and others, who want to combine physical and mental labor and become all-round individuals with a communist style. The depiction of young intellectuals Ma Aiqun and Jiang Lina is also very meaningful, showing that they are advancing towards physical labor, and although there are shortcomings, they are constantly overcoming their weaknesses.

Because the play portrays a new generation of people, the entire play gives a sense of freshness and vigor. Unlike some plays, where the plot remains unclear even after a large part has been performed, making people impatient. The performances of many actors are vivid and powerful, especially the lively and playful Yao Eryong, who is portrayed as very lovable.

    舞台上的敢想敢做的人
    任桂林
    青岛市话剧团为全国青年积极分子大会的代表演了一出戏，名字叫“敢想敢做的人”的时候，我也在看戏。舞台上剧中主人公的敢想敢做，引起了台下敢想敢做观众的共鸣，台上台下掌声笑声，打成了一片，简直是新中国新时代一幅美丽的画面啊！
    “敢想敢做的人”是描写青年木工张英杰和姚二勇，想闹技术革命，发明个电动对缝机，经过多次失败，渡过重重难关，最后，在党的支持下，终于成功了，大大地提高了生产量。
    本来这是一个很普通的故事，但是剧本写得和演得都十分生动感人。作者抓住了生活中一个重要的侧面，剧中主人公所遇到的困难和阻挠不是来自别方面，而是来自自家人，来自一起工作的同志，来自直接的领导人，这就是车间的万主任和王支书。他们也是革命者，也是好同志，但是他们却压抑了更好的同志。剧本正确地揭开和发掘了人民内部的矛盾，先进和落后、革新和保守的矛盾。矛盾的发展，步步尖锐，最后到水火难容，然而他们之间革命立场的一致性，却丝毫无伤；这种十分自然而恰当的处理，我觉得是剧本成功的地方。
    特别是万主任的描写，他的精神状态和言语举动，给人留下了难忘的印象。人们对他的一言一语，一举一动，不时发出笑声，但却不憎恶他。他有句很好的口头语“你是不知道哇”！这么句极普通的话，在剧中十分突出，这明显地说明了他在困难面前的态度，不是勇于去克服，而是感到委屈不被人理解。这种有保守思想的人，在解决问题时，常常是把不正确的当做正确，把正确的反而当做不正确；事后得到了教训，才弄明白。万主任这个典型人物，确是有现实教育意义的。
    另外，对于姜总工程师的处理，作者也没有采取简单化的办法。开初他还称赞工人们的发明创造，但遇到了具体困难又变了，最后，通过实际的教育，他才又变过来。这么变了两变，把一个善良的老年知识分子的精神面貌，生动地表露出来了。
    这个戏不仅写了工人的发明创造，还接触到了一个更大的问题，那就是目前还以体力劳动为主的工人，能不能同时也成为脑力劳动者。以万主任为代表的一些人是不相信这一点的。他们遭到了青年工人张英杰姚二勇等的坚决反抗，他们要做体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的人，使自己成为具有共产主义风格的全面的人。剧中对青年知识分子马爱群和姜丽娜的描写，也是很有意义的，可以看出他们正在向体力劳动进军，尽管还有缺点，但是他们正在不断地克服自己的弱点。
    正因为剧本表现的是新一代的人物，因而整个戏使人感到一种清新、爽朗的风格。不像有些话剧，戏已经演过一大半，还弄不清来龙去脉，叫人实在不耐烦。许多演员的表演，都很鲜明有力，特别是活泼顽皮的姚二勇，演得十分可爱。
