    Studying Philosophy Boosts Enthusiasm
    Ding Desheng, from a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Kunming
    During a "five checks, five comparisons" meeting held by the Party branch in June, every comrade examined their enthusiasm. I thought my enthusiasm was quite high, so I didn't examine it very well. However, at the meeting, comrades criticized me for not having enough enthusiasm. At the time, I couldn't understand it. I thought I hadn't been to town in weeks, and I didn't go to bed earlier than others. Why did everyone still say I didn't have enough enthusiasm?
    Later, I fell ill and was hospitalized, where I was with Second Platoon Leader Long Guangliang for treatment. During this time, I skimmed through a book on basic philosophical knowledge and also read several articles in other books and in "Red Flag" and "Creation." After reading about a problem, I would discuss it with Second Platoon Leader, connecting it with my own thoughts and work. The more I learned, the more interested I became. Every issue discussed in those articles was related to my work and thoughts. The more I related to them, the clearer the issues became. From over a month of study, I realized that philosophy helped me find the reasons for my lack of enthusiasm and taught me many ways to view problems and methods of working. For example, I read about the relationship between the subjective and the objective in "The Primacy of Matter and the Secondarity of Consciousness." One passage said: "To make one's work an effective labor, one must strive to ensure that one's thinking correctly reflects the objective things around one and the laws of development... to make subjective understanding consistent with the objective, and then draw correct conclusions from this as a basis for guiding revolutionary action." I recalled my own thoughts, which made me begin to realize that my thinking was lagging behind the development of things. I further thought of how our troops, under the illumination of the General Line, were just like the workers and peasants, with every soldier full of enthusiasm and everyone striving for the top. This unstoppable enthusiasm was the objective reality of our troops. However, I didn't see this. I was still using last year's calendar to look at this year's problems. I thought that this year's daily training time was much longer than in 1957, so everyone must be quite tense. Therefore, sometimes when I discovered problems that needed to be discussed in a group, I didn't discuss them, fearing that gathering to talk about this and that would make the comrades even more tense. As a result, what should have been said wasn't said, and the comrades were even more dissatisfied. Now I understand that this is because my understanding lagged behind reality.

    学了哲学干劲足
    解放军驻昆明部队某部  丁德胜
    在6月份支部召开的一次五查五比的会议上，每个同志都检查了自己的干劲。我想我的干劲不小，就没有很好的检查。可是在会议上同志们都批评我干劲不大，当时我很想不通，自己认为几个礼拜都不上次街，晚上休息又不比别人睡的早，为什么大家还说干劲不大呢？
    后来我闹病住进医院，和二排长龙光亮在一起治病。这段时间里我将哲学常识粗读了一遍，还看了其它书上的几篇文章，和“红旗”“创造”上的几篇文章。读完一个问题就和二排长扯一扯，联系自己的思想和工作，越学越有兴趣。那些文章里讲的每一个问题都和我的工作、思想联系得上，越联系问题越明确，从一个多月的学习来看，哲学帮我找到了干劲不足的原因，也教给了我许多看问题的方法和工作方法。比如我读了“物质第一性意识第二性”中主观和客观的关系，其中有一段说：“要使自己的工作能够成为有成效的劳动，就必须力求自己的思想，正确的反映周围的客观事物及发展规律……使主观认识和客观一致，然后从这里得出正确的结论，作为指导革命行动的根据”。我回忆了自己的思想情况，使我开始发觉到了我的思想落在事物发展的后面了。我进一步联想到我们部队也同样在总路线的照耀下，和工人农民一样，战士们个个干劲十足，人人力争上游，这种阻挡不住的干劲就是我们部队的客观实际。然而我就没有看到这一点。我仍然是用去年的皇历看今年问题。认为今年每天训练的时间比1957年多得多，大家一定相当紧张了，所以有时发现问题需要集合起来讲一讲的也就不讲了。怕集合讲这讲那，同志们会更紧张。结果呢，该讲的不讲，同志们反而更不满意。现在我才明确这是认识落后于实际了。
