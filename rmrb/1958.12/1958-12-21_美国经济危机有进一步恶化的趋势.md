        The US Economic Crisis Shows a Trend of Further Deterioration

                          I

    The US industrial production index fell to 126 in April this year (with 1947-1949 as 100), a decrease of 13.1% compared with 145 at the beginning of the crisis in August last year. From May, there was some monthly growth, reaching 138 in October, recovering about half of the decline. The production recovery was mainly in the construction industry and light industries producing non-durable consumer goods, while the heavy industry saw very limited improvement. Compared with August last year, the production index of durable consumer goods in September this year was still 14.3% lower, with steel production down 24%, machinery down 14%, and automobiles down 40%. It is estimated that this year's steel production will be 84 million tons, and automobile production will be 4.2 million vehicles, each decreasing by 20% to 30% compared with last year.

    The reasons for the temporary and partial recovery of industrial production are: (1) Increased government spending, especially accelerating spending before the congressional elections. The federal budget expenditure for this fiscal year is 79.2 billion US dollars, an increase of 7.3 billion compared with the 1958 fiscal year; among which military expenditure (including atomic energy and military aid, etc.) increased by 1.9 billion; non-military expenditures such as agriculture and housing construction increased by a total of 5.4 billion. In the third quarter of this year, the annual rate of federal expenditure was as high as 89 billion (including trust fund expenditures), an increase of 3 billion compared with the second quarter and 6.2 billion compared with the first quarter. Including state and local governments, this year's expenditure on the purchase of goods and services will account for 21% of the gross national product, compared to about 19% last year. (2) Relaxing credit and rising prices have stimulated speculation in commodities and the stock market (stock prices have risen by 14% since February this year), and have enabled some enterprises to replenish their inventories. (3) In addition, the creation of tense situations in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait in the previous period also fueled commercial speculation.

    This kind of economic "recovery" is just a false mutation in the process of crisis development, and the crisis situation still exists seriously. At present, the operating rate of the entire manufacturing industry is only 75%; the average operating rate of steel throughout the year is less than 60%, and that of automobiles is only 40%. The official figures for total unemployment are still around 4 million, with more than 12 million underemployed. In the agricultural sector, production has increased by nearly 10% this year despite reducing the cultivated area, resulting in a new "disaster of abundance"; it is estimated that within this fiscal year, the government's accumulated surplus agricultural products will increase from the current 7.2 billion US dollars to 8.2 billion US dollars.

    At the same time, the basic factors that determine the development of the US economic crisis continue to deteriorate. (1) Fixed capital investment remains sluggish, and is expected to decline further next year. Due to the massive surplus of production capacity, future corporate investment will only be for the equipment renewal necessary to maintain competition. According to the Department of Commerce report, fixed capital investment this year will be 30.5 billion US dollars, a decrease of about 17% compared with last year (of which manufacturing decreased by 28%), while the original estimate was a decrease of 13%; if calculated by quarter, the third quarter of this year has decreased by 22% compared with the same period last year. The US "Commercial and Financial Chronicle" believes that the current machine tool orders have been reduced by 50% compared with last year, only one-third of that in 1956, and it can be asserted that corporate investment in the first half of next year will decrease by 5%-8% compared with the same period this year. According to recent survey data from "McGraw-Hill" publishing company, even if enterprises update equipment to intensify competition in the next five years, the estimated annual investment will be reduced to 27 billion to 29 billion US dollars, and equipment renewal also has technical and financial difficulties. In the first nine months of this year, the total profit of monopoly capital has decreased by 25% compared with the same period last year, but the dividends paid by various enterprises remain the same, without reduction, but the capital accumulation for expanded reproduction has been reduced. (2) Domestic and foreign markets are shrinking. Newspapers estimate that due to unemployment and underemployment, one-third of families nationwide have been severely hit by declining incomes. In October this year, the total wages paid by the entire industrial sector, calculated at an annual rate, totaled 97.5 billion US dollars, a decrease of 900 million from September; it was 5.6 billion lower than August last year, a decrease of 5.4%. Among them, the total wages in the manufacturing industry decreased by about 10% compared with August last year. Coupled with taxes, debt repayment, and rising prices, consumers' ability to demand is constantly decreasing. The retail trade volume, which directly reflects market purchasing power, fell by 4% in September this year (16.3 billion) compared with August; if the factor of rising prices is taken into account, it is even lower than the lowest point in February this year (16.1 billion). In terms of foreign markets, in the first half of this year, US capital exports were 2.08 billion US dollars (of which private investment was 1.76 billion), a decrease of 21% compared with the same period last year. US commodity exports totaled 12.1 billion US dollars in the first nine months of this year, a decrease of 17% compared with the same period last year; it is generally estimated that it will decrease by 2 billion to 4 billion next year. These situations will inevitably deepen the development of the crisis.

    More seriously, the government's artificial measures, such as increasing spending and relaxing credit, have led to the development of financial crises. This is mainly manifested in: (1) A sharp increase in fiscal deficits. The federal budget deficit for this fiscal year will increase from 2.8 billion in fiscal year 1958 to 12.2 billion; including trust fund payments, the cash deficit will reach 13.7 billion, setting a record high for previous crisis periods. (2) The government has great difficulty in borrowing. The national debt now reaches 280.8 billion, exceeding the peak of 1953 during the Korean War; this fiscal year, another 75 billion in maturing national debt must be redeemed, further exacerbating the tension in the securities market. In the first half of this year, commercial banks sold 6.2 billion in national debt by lowering bank reserve requirements. Since July this year, the Ministry of Finance has been forced to borrow 3.6 billion in taxes from the market in advance and sell 4.7 billion in treasury bills due immediately due to payment difficulties. The difficulty in selling government bonds not only puts the national finances in an extremely unstable state, but also threatens to disrupt the entire credit system. (3) Malignant currency inflation. In the past year, the money supply has increased by 12.8 billion, doubling the annual inflation rate in the early stages of the crisis. The current money supply totals 232.8 billion, about four times that of the pre-war year of 1936. In September this year, the price index has risen by 2.2% compared with the same period last year, and by 4.7% compared with the end of 1956. The purchasing power of the US dollar is now only 48% of pre-war levels. (4) Inflation has shaken the credibility of the US dollar. Since January this year, gold outflows have reached 2.2 billion US dollars, and it is estimated that gold reserves will decrease by 3 billion US dollars for the entire year. The current currency issuance in the United States requires 11.9 billion US dollars in gold reserves, while the treasury's gold reserves have been reduced to 20.7 billion US dollars. If foreign-held US dollar securities (11.7 billion) are to be paid, there will be a "difference" of 2.9 billion US dollars. Currently, there are calls in the capitalist world market to raise gold prices and devalue the US dollar. These serious situations are unprecedented in the previous two "recessions." The US "Commercial and Financial Chronicle" pointed out that the severity of inflation and financial crisis is "comparable to" 1929.

                           II

    At present, the differences of opinion within the US ruling group on anti-crisis measures have become increasingly acute. The Eastern Wall Street consortium, led by the Rockefeller consortium, which has close ties with military production and greater economic interests abroad, tends to advocate the use of deficit spending methods such as increasing military spending and foreign aid, and reducing taxes on large enterprises to stimulate the domestic market and foreign economic expansion. At the same time, a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises also hope that the government will expand spending and increase orders to maintain their precarious economic activities. They are represented by the "internationalists" of the Republican Party and the "liberals" of the Democratic Party, who now have an advantage in Congress. The "conservatives" of the Midwestern and Southern consortia, which mainly represent the domestic market, are worried that huge fiscal deficits will cause inflation to develop to the point where it is difficult to clean up, as in France, West Germany in the past, and Kuomintang China, and strongly demand tight money to stabilize the US dollar.

    Currently, the pressure from these two factions on the government is very great. The US government has now been forced to adopt a tight monetary policy in finance, but under the pressure of the economic crisis and the Wall Street consortium, the fiscal budget cannot be tightened much; it will basically maintain the existing level of military spending, or even slightly increase it, to offset cuts in non-military spending. In this way, the original US "anti-recession plan" will inevitably be tightened, which will increase the number of unemployed and create a greater depression in the domestic consumer market. This approach is undoubtedly aimed at continuing to maintain the high profits of monopoly capital enterprises and transferring the crisis to the working people. The specific practices are:

      (1) Tighten credit to achieve temporary financial stability. By the end of October, the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank has been raised from 1.75% to 2.5%; the interest rate on treasury bills has been raised from 0.875% to 2.5%; and the margin for purchasing stocks has been raised from 50% to 90%, reaching the highest limit since 1947. The aim is to absorb floating capital, stop gold outflows, and curb speculation in the stock market. In addition, the government is also considering controlling consumer credit to prevent credit bankruptcies. These measures may temporarily have some deflationary effects in the financial market, but in turn, they will have the side effect of promoting a decline in economic activity. For example, the construction industry, which was stimulated by credit, has recently shown a decline, and it is estimated that residential construction will decrease by 15% to 20% next year.

      (2) Restrict the increase in military spending. Eisenhower has frozen the additional military appropriation (1.17 billion US dollars) approved by Congress this year, requiring that direct military spending be limited to 40.8 billion US dollars. Although this is an increase of 1.8 billion compared with the previous year's expenditure, due to the increase in the cost of new weapons procurement, the rise in military equipment costs (about 3%), personnel salary increases (700 million US dollars), and the losses of military activities in the previous period (the invasion of Lebanon cost 200 million, and the intervention in Jinmen and Mazu cost an additional 250 million), the Department of Defense has now been forced to announce that it will reduce the current military force from 2.6 million to 2.525 million, and delay the military equipment production plan. Eisenhower recently also requested that next year's military expenditure should still strengthen the development of new weapons and the procurement of missiles, and the expenditure limit will not exceed 41.5 billion. This is close to the current level of military expenditure, but the next year's expenditure plan currently proposed by the three services is 57 billion US dollars. It seems that it is difficult to have much austerity in military spending.

      (3) Cut non-military spending and transfer the crisis to the working people. It is reported that the total government expenditure that Eisenhower will propose for the next year will be maintained at the level of this year, of which military expenditure will remain the same, or slightly increase, while housing construction (estimated to be reduced by 1 billion), unemployment relief, agricultural product price subsidies, and other "anti-recession" plans will be reduced. In order to cut spending, it has been decided to lay off 2% of government employees (saving 200 million US dollars per year), and the original plan to subsidize depressed areas, build airports, and civil service retirees (totaling about 1.4 billion US dollars) in the next four years has been rejected. At the same time, the government insists on maintaining high taxes to curb deficit spending and inflation. Congress has stated that a general tax cut is "impossible," but it is currently studying tax legislation in an attempt to change tax rules and open up new tax sources. From the fact that Congress has passed a reduction in railway transportation taxes, it will further increase the burden on workers and small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, the government is also considering measures such as controlling wages and prices to launch a new offensive against labor. At present, general large enterprises have strengthened labor intensity and extended working hours to strengthen the exploitation of workers. It is estimated that in the past year, workers' labor productivity has increased by about 5% to 6%, while in 1947 to 1953, labor productivity increased by an average of 3.5% per year, and the weekly working hours have increased from 38.3 hours in April this year to 39.8 hours in September.

      (4) Step up economic expansion into colonies, semi-colonies, especially into Asia and Africa. The approach is to use state capital as a guide to pave the way for private capital. At the same time, at present, it also adopts the method of "partnership" with other capitalist countries to make up for the shortage of US government loan funds, hoping to stabilize the finances of local countries, invigorate the market, and create conditions for the export of US goods. To this end, the US government has now launched the following activities:

      (1) Expand economic aid and reduce military aid in the foreign aid plan. Economic aid mainly takes the form of loans repayable in local currency. For example, the "Economic Development Loan Fund" under economic aid will increase from the existing 700 million US dollars to 1 billion US dollars (this fund was established in the 1958 fiscal year and began operating in January this year, and has promised to lend 572.2 million US dollars, of which Asian and African countries account for 73%). In addition, Congress has approved increasing the loan limit of the US Export-Import Bank from 5 billion to 7 billion, and plans to increase loans to 1.1 billion this year (856 million in fiscal year 1958, of which Asia accounts for about 50% and Latin America accounts for 30%); it is mainly used to provide short-term financial assistance to raw material producing countries with economic difficulties, requiring them to reduce raw material production and regulate exports, which will actually make the economic situation of Latin American and Southeast Asian countries relying on raw material exports even worse, while deepening their dependence on the US dollar.

    (2) "Partner" with other capitalist countries. Recently, it has agreed at the New Delhi Conference to increase the share of the "International Monetary Fund" by 50% (a total increase of 2.3 billion in gold and US dollars); the United States will provide 1.375 billion (of which 25% is paid in gold, which must be approved by Congress), and absorb the gold and US dollar reserves of West Germany, Canada, and other countries to financially support other countries with trade payment difficulties, mainly to support the stability of the pound sterling, in order to dump goods into the sterling area. At the same time, it also agreed to increase the recognized funds of the World Bank by 100%. The US government will not have to take out money, as long as it guarantees the bank to raise 2.54 billion US dollars, in order to support private capital and commodity exports (the bank loaned 710 million in fiscal year 1958, of which more than half was lent to Asian countries). In addition, the US government also suggested adding an "International Development Association" to the bank, which will be provided by the United States with 300 million US dollars of its 1 billion US dollars in establishment funds, to encourage other capitalist countries to jointly provide "long-term loans at low interest rates" to backward regions. The US press believes that this "partnership" approach can reduce the US's fiscal deficit burden and allow other countries to share the "risks" of political instability in Asia and Africa.

      (3) Engage in regional development plans. Because many governments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America require the development of their own national industries, and are brewing the establishment of a common market, some of them have asked the United States for loans that they can control the use of; the United States sees this trend and fears that these countries will alienate and break away from the United States economically, and strengthen economic relations with Western Europe and socialist countries, so it also proposes regional development agencies to carry out deception and appeasement. The US government has currently proposed the establishment of "Middle East" and "Pan-American" development banks, but only promises to take out 100 million US dollars each as establishment funds, absorbing local capital to participate, which is actually convenient for the United States to control.

    Foreign markets are very important for maintaining US economic activity. 11% of industrial products and 20% of agricultural products are used for export, but the US economy is basically maintained by the domestic market. Especially during the current crisis period, US monopoly capital is stepping up foreign expansion on the one hand, and demanding higher tariff barriers on the other hand; and the entire capitalist world economic crisis is developing, and competition in foreign markets will become increasingly fierce; at the same time, nationalism in colonies and semi-colonies continues to rise, the political situation is very turbulent, and US private capital also shows reluctance to move forward and dare not take too much risk; and the capital that has already been invested will not be able to activate the market and expand commodity exports in the short term. Based on these situations, the United States' strengthening of foreign economic expansion cannot play a large role in alleviating the current crisis.

                         III

    Recently, the bourgeois press has been talking about the United States facing even more severe blows. The famous American bourgeois economist Hobbs pointed out that government artificial measures are only "temporary stimulants." He estimates that the US industrial production index may rise somewhat in the next few months, but in April next year, it may fall sharply to 120, a decrease of 20% compared with the starting point of the crisis; at the same time, due to the financial crisis, commodity prices and the stock market also face the danger of a sharp drop. The Rockefeller consortium's "Manhattan Chase Bank" also expressed concern about the difficulty of getting through next year in a recent economic research report.

    In general, this severe economic crisis in the United States is based on the highly developed contradiction between production and the market, and it broke out after the government took all artificial measures. In the past half year, the US government's expansion and acceleration of budget spending and loose monetary policies have stimulated speculation in the commodity and stock markets, temporarily causing production to recover somewhat, but the basic factors that determine the development of the crisis continue to deteriorate. The US government's current tight monetary policy in finance will undoubtedly deepen the market downturn. The artificial measures of expansion or contraction taken by the US government will become increasingly powerless as the economic crisis intensifies. Moreover, this method of artificial respiration, tight and loose, takes care of stimulating the economy, it will aggravate the financial crisis, and if it takes care of finance, it will not be able to take care of the economy, the result can only be mutual influence and mutual dragging, making the crisis more prolonged and profound.

    美国经济危机有进一步恶化的趋势
    苑文
                          一
    美国工业生产指数，今年4月已跌至一百二十六（以1947—1949年为一百），即较去年8月危机起点（一百四十五）下降了13.1％。5月起逐月有些增长，10月增至一百三十八，约回升了下跌的半数。生产回升主要是建筑业和非耐用消费品的轻工业，重工业起色很有限。与去年8月相比，今年9月耐用消费品生产指数仍低14.3％，其中钢铁下降24％，机器14％，汽车40％。估计今年钢产八千四百万吨，汽车四百二十万辆，各较去年减产20％到30％。
    工业生产暂时局部回升的原因是：（一）政府开支增大，特别是在国会选举前加速了开支。本年度联邦预算开支七百九十二亿美元，较1958年度增加了七十三亿；其中军费（包括原子能和军援等）增加十九亿；农业、房屋建筑等非军事开支共增五十四亿。今年第三季，联邦开支年率高达八百九十亿（包括信托基金支出），较第二季增大三十亿，较第一季则增六十二亿。包括州和地方政府在内，今年用于采购货物及劳务的支出将占到国民生产总值的21％，去年约为19％。（二）放松信贷和物价上涨，刺激了商品和股票市场投机（股票价格已较今年2月上涨14％），并使部分企业重新增加了存货。（三）加之前一时期在中东和台湾海峡制造紧张局势，也助长了商业投机活动。
    这种经济“回升”只是危机发展过程中的虚假变态，危机情况仍然严重存在。目前整个制造业的开工率只有75％；钢铁全年开工率平均不到60％，汽车只有40％。官方发表的全失业人数仍在四百万左右，还有一千二百多万半失业者。农业方面，今年在缩小耕地面积的情况下将近增产了10％，已造成新的“丰收之灾”；估计在本年度内，政府积存的剩余农产品将从目前七十二亿美元增至八十二亿美元。
    同时，决定美国经济危机发展的基本因素还在继续恶化。（一）固定资本投资仍一蹶不振，预计明年还要下降。由于生产能力大量过剩，今后企业投资将只是维持竞争所必须的设备更新。据商务部报告，今年固定资本投资将为三百零五亿美元，约较去年下降17％（其中制造业下降28％），而原估计下降13％；如按季度计算，今年第三季已较去年同期下降22％。美“商业金融纪事报”认为，目前机床订单已比去年减少50％，仅及1956年的三分之一，可以断言明年上半年的企业投资将比今年同期下降5％—8％。另据“麦格罗·希尔”出版公司最近调查材料说，在今后五年内，即使企业为加剧竞争而更新设备，估计每年投资亦将减至二百七十至二百九十亿美元，且设备更新还有技术和资金上的困难。今年头九个月中，垄断资本的利润总额已较去年同期下降25％，但各企业支取红利仍然照旧，并没有减少，而是把扩大再生产的资金积累加以缩减了。（二）国内外市场日趋萎缩。报刊估计，由于失业和半失业，全国现有三分之一的家庭受到了收入下降的严重打击。今年10月，整个产业部门支付的工资按年率计算共九百七十五亿美元，较9月降低九亿；较去年8月则低五十六亿，即下降5.4％。其中，制造业的工资总额约较去年8月降低了10％。再加上付税、还债和物价上涨，消费者的需求能力正在不断降低。直接反映市场购买力的零售贸易额，今年9月（一百六十三亿）已较8月下跌4％；如将物价上涨因素估计在内，比今年2月的最低点（一百六十一亿）还要低。在国外市场方面，今年上半年，美国资本输出二十点八亿美元（其中私人投资十七点六亿），较去年同期下降了21％。美国商品出口贸易，今年头九个月共值一百二十一亿美元，已较去年同期下降17％；一般估计明年还要减少二十至四十亿。这些情况势将加深危机的发展。
    更为严重的是，政府采取增加开支、放松信贷等人为措施的结果又导致财政金融危机的发展。主要表现在：（一）财政赤字激增。本年度联邦预算赤字，将从1958年度的二十八亿增至一百二十二亿；包括信托基金支付，现金赤字则达一百三十七亿，创历次危机时期的最高纪录。（二）政府举债困难很大。国债现达二千八百零八亿，已超过侵朝战争期间1953年度的高峰；本年度还有七百五十亿到期国债必须兑换，更加剧了证券市场的紧张局面。今年上半年商业银行推销国债六十二亿，是靠降低银行储备金来实现的。今年7月以来，财政部迫于支付困难，已向市场提前借用税款三十六亿，并卖出即期国库券四十七亿。政府债券推销困难，不仅使国家财政处于极不稳定的状态，而且有使整个信贷系统遭受破坏的危险。（三）通货恶性膨胀。一年来，货币供应量增加一百二十八亿，较危机前期年膨胀数加了一番。目前货币供应量共达二千三百二十八亿，约为战前1936年的四倍。今年9月，物价指数已较去年同期上涨2.2％，较1956年底则上涨了4.7％。美元购买力现在只值战前的48％。（四）通货膨胀已使美元信用发生动摇。从今年1月以来，黄金外流已达二十二亿美元，估计全年黄金储备将要减少三十亿美元。美国现在货币发行量需要黄金储备一百一十九亿美元，而国库存储黄金已减至二百零七亿美元，如要支付外国持有的美元证券（一百一十七亿），将有二十九亿美元的“差额”。目前，资本主义世界市场上已有要求提高黄金价格使美元贬值的呼声。这些严重情况都是前两次“衰退”中所未有的。美“商业金融纪事报”指出，通货膨胀和财政金融危机的严重程度已和1929年“不相上下”。
                           二
    目前，美国统治集团内部在反危机措施上的意见分歧已日趋尖锐。以洛克菲勒财团为首的东部华尔街财团，与军火生产有密切关系并在国外经济利益较大，倾向于主张采用增加军费和援外、减少大企业的税等不惜赤字开支的办法，来刺激国内市场和对外经济扩张。同时大量中小企业也指望政府扩大开支、增加订货，借以维持它们岌岌可危的经济活动。他们通过共和党“国际派”和民主党“自由派”为代言人，现在国会中占有优势。另外以代表国内市场为主的中西部财团和南方财团的“保守派”，耽忧巨大财政赤字将使通货膨胀发展到像法国以及过去西德、国民党中国那样难以收拾，强烈要求紧缩通货来稳定美元。
    目前这两派人对政府的压力都很大。美国政府现已被迫在财政金融上采取了紧缩政策，但在经济危机和华尔街财团的压力下，财政预算仍紧缩不了多少；基本上将维持原有的军事开支水平，或者还将少许增加一些，以削减非军事开支来弥补。这样美国原来的一套“反衰退计划”势将紧缩，就会使失业人数增加并造成国内消费市场更大的萧条。这种做法无疑是为了继续保持垄断资本企业的高额利润，而把危机转嫁给劳动人民。其具体做法是：
      （一）抽紧银根，以求得金融的暂时稳定。到10月底，已将联邦储备银行的贴现率从1.75％提高到2.5％；国库券利率从0.875％提高到2.5％；购买股票的保证金从50％提高到90％，达1947年以来最高限额。想借此吸收游资、制止黄金外流和股票市场投机。此外，政府还在考虑控制消费者信贷，以防止信用破产。这些措施可能在金融市场上暂时起到一些通货收缩作用，但反过来又会产生促进经济活动下降的副作用。例如靠信贷刺激起来的建筑业，最近已有下跌现象，估计明年住宅建筑将下降15％至20％。
      （二）限制军费开支增大。艾森豪威尔已将本年度国会批准的追加军事拨款（十一亿七千万美元）给予冻结，要求把直接军费开支限制在四百零八亿美元。这较上年度开支虽然增多十八亿，但因新武器采购费用增大，并由于军备费用上涨（约3％）、人员增薪（七亿美元）以及前一时期军事活动的损耗（侵略黎巴嫩花费二亿，干涉金、马又多费二点五亿），国防部现已被迫宣布将目前兵力从二百六十万人裁减到二百五十二万五千人，并拖延了军备生产计划。艾森豪威尔最近还要求，下年度军费仍需加强新武器发展和导弹采购，而开支限额将不超过四百一十五亿。这与本年度军费水平相近，但三军目前提出的下年度开支计划是五百七十亿美元。看来，在军费上是很难有多少紧缩的。
      （三）削减非军事开支，向劳动人民转嫁危机。据悉，艾森豪威尔最近将要提出的下年度政府开支总额将维持在本年度的水平，其中军费仍将维持现状，或再增加一些，而房屋建筑（估计要减十亿）、失业救济、农产品价格补贴费以及其他“反衰退”计划将要减少。现为削减开支，已决定解雇政府职员2％（每年可省二亿美元），并否决了原计划在今后四年内对萧条地区、修建航空港以及文职退休人员的补助金（共约十四亿美元）。同时，政府坚持仍将维持高额税收来遏制赤字开支和通货膨胀。国会已表示，普遍减税是“不可能的”，但目前正在研究税收法案，企图改变税则，另辟税源。从国会已通过减免铁路运输税来看，将进一步加重劳工和中小企业的负担。此外，政府还在考虑控制工资和物价等措施，来向劳工发动新的进攻。目前，一般大企业都加强了劳动强度，延长工作时间来加强对工人的剥削。估计一年来，工人的劳动生产率约提高了5％至6％，而在1947至1953年，劳动生产率平均每年增长3.5％，而且每周工作时间已从今年4月的三十八点三小时增加到9月的三十九点八小时。
      （四）加紧对殖民地、半殖民地、特别是对亚非地区的经济扩张。做法是以国家资本为前导，为私人资本开辟道路，同时在目前还采取与其他资本主义国家“合伙”的办法，以弥补美国政府贷款资金的不足，想借此稳定当地国家的财政，活跃市场，为美国商品输出创造条件。为此，美国政府现已展开了以下几方面的活动：
      （1）在援外计划上扩大经援，削减军援。经援主要采取可用当地货币偿还的贷款形式，如经援项下的“经济开发贷款基金”将由现有七亿美元增至十亿美元（这笔基金在1958年度开始设立，从今年1月开始活动，已允诺贷出五亿七千二百万美元。其中亚非国家占73％）。此外，国会已批准将美国进出口银行贷款限额从五十亿提高到七十亿，打算将本年度贷款增为十一亿（1958年度为八点五六亿，其中亚洲约占50％，拉丁美洲占30％）；主要用来向经济困难的原料生产国家提供短期财政援助，要他们削减原料生产和管制出口，这实际上会使拉丁美洲和东南亚依靠原料出口国家的经济情况更加恶化，同时加深了对美元的依赖。
    （2）与其他资本主义国家“合伙”。最近已在新德里会议上同意将“国际货币基金组织”的份额增加50％（共增黄金美元二十三亿）；美国将提供十三点七五亿（其中25％以黄金支付，须经国会批准），并吸收西德、加拿大等国的黄金美元储备，用来在财政上支持其他贸易支付困难的国家，主要是支持英镑的稳定，以便向英镑区倾销商品。同时还同意把世界银行的公认资金提高100％。美国政府将不用拿出钱来，只要为该银行担保筹借二十五点四亿美元，借以支持私人资本和商品输出（该银行1958年度贷款七点一亿，其中有一半以上是贷给亚洲国家的）。此外，美国政府还建议在该银行中增设一个“国际开发协会”，将由美国提供其创办资金十亿美元中的三亿美元，用来鼓励其他资本主义国家共同向落后地区提供“低利率的长期贷款”。美国报刊认为，这种“合伙”做法可以减轻美国在财政上的赤字负担，并使其他国家分担亚非地区政治局势不稳的“风险”。
      （3）搞区域性开发计划。由于许多亚非和拉丁美洲国家政府要求发展本国的民族工业，并在酝酿成立共同市场，有的则向美国要求能由他们自己支配用途的贷款；美国看到这个趋势，唯恐这些国家在经济上疏远和摆脱美国，加强与西欧以及社会主义国家的经济关系，因此也提出区域性开发机构，进行欺骗和拢络。美政府目前已建议成立“中东”和“泛美”开发银行，但分别只答应拿出一亿美元作为创办资金，吸收当地资本参加，实际上是便于美国控制。
    国外市场对维持美国的经济活动是很重要的，现在工业产品的11％和农产品的20％用于出口，但美国经济基本上是靠国内市场维持的。特别是在目前危机时期，美国垄断资本一面加紧对外扩张，一面要求提高关税壁垒；而且整个资本主义世界经济危机正在发展，国外市场的竞争也会越来越尖锐；同时殖民地和半殖民地的民族主义仍在继续高涨，政治局势动荡很大，美国私人资本也表现出裹足不前，不敢冒太大风险；而已经投进的资本也不是短期就能起到活跃市场、扩大商品输出的效果的。根据这些情况，美国加强对外经济扩张也不能对缓和当前危机产生多大作用。
                         三
    最近以来，资产阶级报刊已在纷纷谈论美国经济还要遭到更为严重的打击。美国著名的资产阶级经济学家霍布斯指出，政府人为措施只是“暂时的兴奋剂”，他估计美国工业生产指数在今后几个月内也许还会有些上升，但在明年4月可能急剧下降到一百二十，即较危机起点下降20％；同时由于财政金融危机，商品价格和股票市场也有暴跌的危险。洛克菲勒财团的“曼哈顿大通银行”在最近发表的经济研究报告中，亦担忧明年这一关很不好过。
    总的看来，美国这次严重的经济危机是在生产与市场矛盾高度发展的基础上，而且是在政府采取了一切人为措施之后暴发的。近半年来，美国政府扩大和加速预算开支，以及放松银根的措施，刺激了商品与股票市场投机，虽暂时使得生产有些回升，但决定危机发展的基本因素仍在继续恶化。美国政府目前在财政上又采取紧缩政策，无疑又会加深市场的不景气。美国政府所采取膨胀或收缩的人为措施，将随着经济危机的严重发展，越发显得无能为力了。而且这种一紧一松的人工呼吸办法，顾了刺激经济就要加剧财政危机，顾了财政就顾不了经济，结果只能是相互影响，相互拖带，使危机更加延续和深刻化。（附图片）
