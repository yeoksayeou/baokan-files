    After a Year of Labor...
    By Our Correspondent Liu Guanghui
    Recently, while visiting the Damaoshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm built by cadres of Jiangxi provincial-level government agencies, this reporter heard everywhere cadres who had been working for a year enthusiastically discussing the precious gains that labor had brought to their thinking. Zhang Min, the deputy director of the farm, said that cadres have undergone a major revolution in their thinking after a year of labor and training in the communist furnace.
    Starting with Labor
    Changing from looking down on physical labor to actively participating in labor is a major gain for cadres who have been sent down for a year of labor. Li Youyu, Li Deqin, and Gao Renshun, members of Ye Lin Production Team in the Xingang Branch Farm, are young students who have just left school. In the past, they had not participated in physical labor, and in their hearts, there was a residual bourgeois idea that "physical labor is inferior to mental labor." After being brought to Damaoshan by a surge of enthusiasm for building mountainous areas at the end of last year, they worked on the mountains, slept on the ground, and their limbs ached from exhaustion every day. At this time, they had some wavering thoughts: Physical labor is really hard. Wouldn't it be better to sit in an office than to come to the mountains? They often discussed it secretly and even prepared to run down the mountain. One day, two days... a year passed. Physical labor finally changed their thinking. They realized in their labor how hard-won a grain of rice and a piece of thatch were. They used the thatch they cut down to build houses and make various production and daily necessities such as baskets, dustpans, and tap water pipes. From this, they realized how great and meaningful labor is! After these three young people fell in love with labor in their hearts, they deeply criticized their thoughts of wanting to escape labor at a life check-up meeting, saying: Although labor is hard, socialism and communism must be created by it; what does it matter to endure a little hardship in order to build a happy society! Not long ago, when this reporter went to visit them, they had become outstanding labor fighters in the entire team, and each of them expressed their determination to continue training on the mountains and build new mountainous areas. They sang: Damaoshan is a good place, gold and silver mines sparkle, timber and thatch are everywhere, shiitake mushrooms and sugarcane are fragrant and sweet; ah! People all say this is a good place, this is our beautiful home.
    Loving the People
    One evening in July this year, Luo Maonan, a member of the Huaqiao Agricultural Cooperative, suddenly fell ill with a high fever and lay on his bed groaning in pain. It was more than ten li away from the clinic, and he couldn't walk there. Soon, his new neighbors—the cadres of the Quan Brigade of the Huaqiao Branch Farm—returned from work and learned about this. Team leader Lin Youquan and the team members immediately rushed to visit him without eating or resting, and immediately made a stretcher and carried Luo Maonan to the clinic in the dark. A few days later, Luo Maonan recovered and returned. He warmly took Lin Youquan's hand and said: "You saved my life. You are really good cadres educated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    Examples of cadres loving the working people are countless on Damaoshan. When the masses were fighting drought, cadres proposed: change spare time into drought-fighting time, and change Sundays into drought-fighting days to help the masses fight drought. They took their own basins and buckets to help the masses carry water and pump water together with the masses. Many cadres also helped peasants learn to read regardless of day or night. Zhang Ningsheng, a cadre sent down to the Hualin Team, went to Shijia Village every night to give literacy classes to the peasants, year after year, regardless of snowstorms and rain. Now this village, which used to have only one literate person, has basically eliminated illiteracy.
    What is the reason that makes these cadres fall in love with the working people? It is because, in labor practice and contact with the working people, the cadres have changed their thinking and viewpoints. Guo Fushan, an assistant teacher at Jiangxi Normal College, used to think that he was young and capable and looked down on the working people. When he went to the mountains, he thought: Farming is very simple, you don't need to use your brain, you can learn it by doing it. Subsequent labor practice and the education of the working people educated him. For example, learning to make a bamboo basket. When he was weaving, he either couldn't weave it successfully, or he wove a "nothing like anything." Later, after the meticulous guidance of a bamboo worker, he spent a lot of effort and thought to learn to make a simple basket. Guo Fushan thought at this time: Many peasants can weave bamboo baskets. They are really clever and willing to help others with their hearts. Their style is high. Now, Guo Fushan said that he feels like he has met relatives when he sees the peasants, and he always wants to talk to them kindly. If he doesn't do this, he feels uncomfortable. Now, every day when he has free time, Guo Fushan runs to the peasant's home to talk, ask for production knowledge and technology, and sometimes help the peasants solve some difficulties.
    Taking Collectivism as the Key Link
    A month ago, the farm headquarters made a decision: to promote Zhu Kairun to be the deputy leader of the Huangbaiyang Production Team because he had good labor training, sufficient confidence in building mountainous areas, great enthusiasm, and the masses trusted him. After the decision was announced, people said:
  "With Lao Zhu as the deputy leader, things will definitely be done well." Zhu Kairun was happy and resentful at the time. He was happy that he had gained the trust of the leadership and the masses, and he hated that his individualistic thinking had been serious in the past. He described his ideological changes to the reporter.
    "In the year of liberation, I became a rural cadre, leading the peasants to fight the landlords, distribute land, and carry out the great production movement. At that time, I was single-mindedly engaged in revolution and never thought about personal matters. Although the work was hard and there was no salary, I was very happy. Later, I studied for a year and entered the Hongdu Machinery Factory to engage in administrative management. After entering the big factory, a salary system was implemented, and my life was greatly improved, but I didn't pay attention to ideological transformation. When I saw the factory building new houses, I asked to live in a new house. After getting one room, I asked for two rooms; the living expenses increased, so I complained about the low salary. The more I spun around in my personal circle, the more serious I became. The leaders and the masses criticized me, and I also said that they didn't understand people.
    "When I went to the mountains for labor training, I learned production techniques such as farming and afforestation. Seeing the crops I planted grow taller day by day, and the mountainous areas change their appearance day by day, I felt happy and refreshed. Especially in labor, I felt that although labor is hard, we cannot build a socialist new mountainous area without labor; at the same time, 'if the big river has no water, the small river will dry up.' If a socialist society cannot be built, personal life cannot be improved. For example, if everyone doesn't work together, we will all have no houses to live in. Besides, the working people are engaged in construction day and night, and I am still engaged in individualism, which is also unfair to the Party and the people.
    "Now, my thinking is clear. I have an inseparable emotion with labor and the people of the mountainous areas, so I am getting more and more energetic. I want to build socialism here together with the masses."

    劳动一年后……
    本报记者  刘光辉
    记者最近在访问江西省级机关干部建成的大茅山综合垦殖场时，到处都听到劳动一年后的干部们畅谈劳动给自己思想上带来的珍贵收获。副场长张敏说，干部在共产主义的熔炉里劳动锻炼一年，思想上发生了一场大革命。
    从劳动写起
    由轻视体力劳动变为积极参加劳动，这是下放干部劳动一年后的一个大收获。新岗分场叶林生产队队员李有余、李德勤和高仁顺是刚走出学校门的青年学生，过去没有参加过体力劳动，在他们的内心里有着“体力劳动比脑力劳动低一等”的残余资产阶级思想。去年年底被一股建设山区的热忱带上了大茅山后，劳动在山上，睡觉是地铺，一天累得四肢酸痛。这时，他们便有了一些动摇：体力劳动真苦，要是不上山，坐办公室多好啊！他们经常悄悄地在一起议论，甚至还准备跑下山来。一天、二天……一年过去了。体力劳动终于改变了他们的思想。他们在劳动中意识到一粒米、一根茅竹是多么得来不易。他们把砍回的茅竹造起房屋，制成箩、箕、自来水管等各种各样生产和日常用具。从这里他们体会到：劳动是多么伟大而有意义！这三个青年人在内心里爱上了劳动后，在一次生活检查会上深刻地批判了自己想逃避劳动的思想，说：劳动虽然苦，可是社会主义、共产主义得靠它来创造；为了建设幸福的社会，吃点苦又算得什么！不久前，记者前去访问时，他们已成为全队出色的劳动战士，个个表示坚决在山上继续锻炼，建设新山区。他们歌唱道：大茅山呀好地方，金矿银矿闪毫光，木材茅竹到处有，香菇甘蔗香又甜；啊！人们都说这里是好地方，这就是我们美丽的家乡。
    热爱人民
    今年7月间的一个傍晚，花桥农业社的一个社员罗毛男突然患了急病，体温陡增，躺在床上痛苦地呻吟着。离医务所有十多里路，走不去。不久，他的新邻居——花桥分场全小队干部收工回来知道了这件事，队长林有全和队员们来不及吃饭和休息，立即跑来探望，并立即做了担架，在黑夜里抬着罗毛男上了医务所。几天后，罗毛男病愈回来了，他亲热地拉着林有全的手说：“你们救了我的命，真是共产党和毛主席教育的好干部。”
    干部热爱劳动人民的事例在大茅山上不胜枚举。在群众抗旱时，干部提出：变业余时间为抗旱时间，变星期天为抗旱天，帮助群众抗旱。他们拿着自己的脸盆、水桶帮助群众运水，与群众一起车水，还有许多干部不分昼夜帮助农民学文化。花林队下放干部张宁生，不顾暴风雪雨，每夜都走到施家村给农民上文化课，一年如一日。现在这个过去只有一个人识字的村庄已基本上扫除了文盲。
    是什么原因使这些干部爱上了劳动人民呢？是因为在劳动实践和与劳动人民接触中，干部们改变了自己的思想和观点，江西师范学院助教郭福善过去认为自己年青又有本事，瞧不起劳动人民，上山时，他想：种田很简单，不用花脑子，搞一下就学会了。以后的劳动实践和劳动人民教育了他。如学制一个竹箩筐。他编织时，不是织不成功，就是织成一个“四不像”，以后经过竹篾工人细致的指导，他费了许多力气和心思才学会制简单的箩筐。郭福善这时想：许多农民都会织竹箩筐，他们真是脑灵手巧，还肯细心帮助别人，风格高。现在，郭福善说，他一看到农民就像见到了亲人，总要和他们亲切地谈谈，不这样做，心里就感到不痛快。如今每天一有空闲，郭福善便跑到农民家里去谈心，请教生产知识和技术，有时还帮助农民解决一些困难。
    以集体主义为纲
    一个月前，场部做了个决议：提升朱开润当黄柏洋生产队副队长，原因是他劳动锻炼的好，建设山区的信心足，干劲大，群众又信任他。决议宣布后，人们说：
  “老朱当副队长，一定能办好事情。”朱开润当时既高兴又发恨，高兴的是得到了领导和群众的信任，恨的是过去个人主义思想严重。他向记者叙述了自己的思想变化。
    “解放那年，我就当了农村干部，领导农民斗地主、分田地，开展大生产运动。那时，一心闹革命，从不想个人的事，虽然工作辛苦、又没有工薪，心里却很愉快。后来学习了一年，进了洪都机械厂搞行政管理工作。进了大工厂，又实行薪金制，生活大改善，可思想上不注意改造了。见到工厂盖新房屋，便要求住新房子，得了一间后就要求两间；生活开支大了，就闹工薪少。越在个人圈子上打转转，就越闹得厉害，领导和群众批评我，我还说不体谅人。
    “上山劳动锻炼，学会了种地、造林等生产技术，看到自己种的庄稼一天天长高，山区日益改变面貌，心里喜悦精神爽快。特别是在劳动中感到：劳动虽苦，可是不劳动就不能建设社会主义新山区；同时，‘大河没水小河干’，社会主义社会建不成，个人生活也提不高。例如，大家不一齐动手，我们便都没有房子住，再说，劳动人民日干夜干地搞建设，我还闹个人主义也对不起党和人民。
    “现在，我的思想通了，和劳动、和山区人民有了不能分割的感情，因此越干越起劲。我要在这里和群众一道建设社会主义。”
