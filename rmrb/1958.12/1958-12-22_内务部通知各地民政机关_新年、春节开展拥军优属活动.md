Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a notice to the civil affairs organs of all provinces (regions) and cities on the 18th regarding the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers during the New Year and Spring Festival of 1959.

The notice said that during the New Year and Spring Festival of 1959, a wide-ranging campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers should be launched to boost the morale of the troops, enhance the people's sense of national defense and determination to fight against the enemy, strengthen the unity between the army and the people, and further promote the enthusiasm of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, so that they can play a greater role in accelerating the construction of socialism.

The notice requires that governments in garrison areas, especially in border defense, coastal defense, and the Fujian front, should organize organs, organizations, schools, and people from all walks of life to conduct慰问 (wèi wèn - offer comfort and solicitude) to the troops and hold joint celebrations with them. With the consent of the political organs of the駐軍 (zhù jūn - stationed troops), local governments may organize county and commune cadres, labor models, and advanced figures from among the families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers to report to the troops on the production achievements, living conditions, and long-term plans for various construction undertakings in their regions, encourage each other, and advance together. Local areas should also offer慰问 (wèi wèn - offer comfort and solicitude) to nearby military hospitals, revolutionary disabled soldiers' sanatoriums, convalescent homes, and chronic disease hospitals for demobilized soldiers, encouraging them to recuperate with peace of mind. Families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers should be mobilized to write letters to their relatives and comrades-in-arms, sharing good news with each other, strengthening the connection between the front and the rear, and boosting the morale of the troops.

The notice pointed out that during the New Year and Spring Festival activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers, socialist and communist ideological education should be carried out for families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers to further stimulate their political enthusiasm for building and defending the motherland. Appropriate forms should also be adopted to widely educate the people on the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and on the concept of national defense, in order to further establish a social atmosphere of caring for and loving families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, and the people's army. Local areas should organize the masses to offer慰问 (wèi wèn - offer comfort and solicitude) to families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled soldiers, and wish them a Happy New Year. Various propaganda tools should be used to widely publicize the exemplary deeds of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in production and construction, encouraging them to make greater achievements in next year's greater production leap forward. At the same time, in conjunction with the activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers, a comprehensive review of preferential treatment and demobilization work should be conducted.

The notice also requires that when carrying out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers, civil affairs organs in various localities should widely publicize the compulsory military service system to the people, especially the vast number of young people, publicize the interrelationship between defending the motherland and building the motherland, and assist relevant departments in doing a good job in the conscription of new soldiers and the return of demobilized compulsory soldiers to their hometowns in 1959.
