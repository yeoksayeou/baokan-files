    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar — Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, has seen rapid construction and a constantly changing appearance in 1958.

    This year, Ulaanbaatar's construction investment increased by 91% compared to last year. Many buildings have sprung up on the original open spaces of Ulaanbaatar: in the spring, an automated confectionery factory officially went into production; in the summer, in Tolgoit on the outskirts of the city, a Friendship Brickyard with an annual output of 25 million bricks also went into production. The capital's first vegetable farm, gymnasium, sports field, and the "Peace Bridge" across the railway line, as well as newly paved asphalt roads, have also been completed one after another. Currently, the roads and bridges here are clear and unobstructed.

    The newly built staff and worker dormitories this year cover an area of 40,000 square meters. The Deputy Mayor of Ulaanbaatar, Chagachi, told reporters that Ulaanbaatar's original long-term construction plan required the construction of 20,000 square meters of housing each year for the next few years, but this year's construction area has exceeded the original plan by one time.

    Deputy Mayor Chagachi said that due to the increase in newly built factories and enterprises in Ulaanbaatar, the number of employees in the capital has also increased, and the total population of the city has reached 160,000. Among them, workers and their families account for 55% of the population. In the past two years, the number of workers in the city has increased by 41%. The city's commerce and service industries have also developed. Two years ago, there were only more than 70 shops and retail stalls in the city, but this year it has increased to more than 200. The retail sales of goods have also increased greatly. (Attached picture)
