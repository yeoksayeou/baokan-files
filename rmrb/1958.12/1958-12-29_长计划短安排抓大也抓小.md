Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th December: Sichuan Province is comprehensively arranging the production and processing of non-staple foods, adopting a method that combines long-term planning with short-term arrangements, and developing poultry, livestock, aquatic products, fresh and dried vegetables, etc., in a comprehensive and localized manner.

Since the rural communes were established throughout the province, the traditional folk non-staple food production and processing have been further developed due to the "walking on two legs" approach adopted by the local Party committees in sideline production. Currently, all parts of the province have established specialized teams for fattening pigs, to fatten a batch of pigs before the Spring Festival to supply urban and rural people with food. On the other hand, attention is also paid to the mating of breeding pigs and the feeding management of small piglets to ensure normal market supply from the Spring Festival to the Dragon Boat Festival. The breeding of small poultry and livestock such as chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, as well as aquatic product breeding, are also being actively developed based on the principle of collective production by the commune as the main focus, supplemented by individual production by commune members.

Most rivers, reservoirs, and paddy fields in Sichuan can be used for fish farming. In mid-December, the professional fishing teams in six special districts and cities throughout the province caught more than 1.4 million parent fish, laying a good foundation for large-scale development next year.

In response to Sichuan's favorable natural conditions of mild climate and evergreen vegetation in most areas, the province regards the development of vegetable production as an important project for developing non-staple food production. The three million mu of vegetables that have been sown throughout the province are growing well. At present, in addition to strengthening the field management of vegetables, various regions are also carrying out high-yield experiments and trial planting of new varieties. Chengdu, Chongqing, and some industrial and mining areas are also rushing to plant short-term crops such as spinach and Chinese cabbage. Many minor non-staple foods, such as chili peppers, daylilies, wood ear mushrooms, melon seeds, ginger, and peppercorns, are not only needed in the province but also supplied to other provinces and for export. The provincial commercial departments have made specific arrangements under the principle of "grasping the big and attending to the small," assisting major producing areas in solving problems such as land, seeds, and technology. The province is also processing 2.6 million dan of dried and pickled vegetables, including the famous Sichuan pickles and kohlrabi.

At present, flour mills, sauce gardens, and sugar mills throughout the province are in intense production to supply urban and rural people during the Spring Festival.

    长计划短安排抓大也抓小
    据新华社成都28日电  四川省全面安排副食品生产、加工，采取长计划与短安排相结合的办法，因地制宜地全面发展家禽、家畜、水产、鲜干菜蔬生产等。
    全省农村公社化以后，由于各地党委在副业生产中采取了“两条腿走路”的方法，许多民间传统的副食品生产、加工，都得到进一步的发展。目前，全省各地一方面建立了催肥猪的专业队，要在春节前育肥一批生猪，供应城乡人民食用。另一方面，也注意到作好种猪的配种，和小架子猪的饲养管理，以保证春节到“端阳”节前后的市场正常供应，对鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等小家禽、家畜和水产繁殖，也在根据公社集体生产为主，社员个人生产为辅的原则，积极发展。
    四川大部分江河、水库、稻田都可以养鱼，12月中旬，全省六个专区和市的专业捕鱼队，就捕得亲鱼一百四十多万尾，为明年大发展打下良好的基础。
    针对四川气候温和、大部分地区四季常青这一有利的自然条件，全省把发展蔬菜生产，作为发展副食品生产的重要项目之一。现在全省已播种的三百万亩蔬菜长得很好。目前各地除了加强蔬菜的田间管理外，还进行了高额丰产试验和试栽新品种的工作。成都、重庆和一些工矿区还抢种菠菜、小白菜等短期作物。许多小宗副食品，如辣椒、黄花、木耳、瓜子、生姜、花椒等，不仅省内市场需要，还要供应外省和出口。省商业部门在“抓大也抓小”的原则下，都作了具体地布置，协助主要产地解决土地、种子、技术等问题。全省还在加工二百六十万担干腌菜，其中包括在国内外著名的榨菜、大头菜等。
    目前，全省各地粉房、酱园、糖坊都在紧张生产，以便春节供应城乡人民。
