Letters to the Editor

People's Daily Editorial Department:

    Last night, in haste, I composed a ci poem to warmly welcome Premier Kim Il-sung's return. In the line "Sino-Korean solidarity is outstanding," I mistakenly wrote the character "斐" (fěi, outstanding) as "非" (fēi, not), which reverses the meaning and is inconsistent with the theme of the poem. I hereby request that the two lines "Friendship forged in blood, Sino-Korean solidarity is not so" be changed to "Friendship forged in battle, Sino-Korean ties are flesh and blood." Please consider and publish this correction.

    Li Jishen, December 9th

    人民日报编辑部：
    昨夜匆匆谱就欢送金日成首相元旋小词，在“中朝团结斐然”句中，把“斐”字误书为“非”字，意既相反，且与词旨不相贯通。兹特将“鲜血凝成友谊，中朝团结非然”二句改为“战斗凝成友谊，中朝血肉相连”还请酌夺，在“更正栏”中加以披露。
