    On "Reform"
    Wang Pu
    There are two ways to observe problems: one is meticulous scientific analysis, and the other is simplistic and careless handling. The two methods produce two different results. If it is the former, after scientific analysis and mastering the objective laws, things can be done smoothly. If it is the latter, it may violate objective laws, and things will not work out. For example, mobilizing the masses in enterprises to reform unreasonable rules and regulations is a great thing that promotes the development of productive forces. However, if we simplify it and indiscriminately include everything, whether reasonable or unreasonable, into the scope of reform and abolition, then it is wrong and will hinder the development of productive forces.
    This is a lack of scientific analysis of the problem. Indeed, there are many rules and regulations in our enterprises that hinder the development of productive forces and need to be resolutely reformed or abolished, and replaced with new rules and regulations. Failure to do so will hinder the continued development of productive forces. However, it is not the case that all rules and regulations hinder the development of productive forces. No matter how many types of rules and regulations there are in an enterprise, they can be summarized into two categories. One category belongs to management systems, which reflect the relationship between people within the enterprise and serve the economic base. The other category reflects the objective laws of the production process, such as technological procedures, etc. Regardless of which category they belong to, rules and regulations all originate from practice, not from people's imagination. As long as they can correctly or largely correctly reflect the objective laws of the development of things, they can in turn promote the development of productive forces. These rules and regulations are reasonable and should be maintained, not reformed, let alone abolished. As for those rules and regulations that cannot correctly reflect the objective laws of the development of things, they should be vigorously reformed or abolished according to different situations.
    At the same time, some rules and regulations that are currently reasonable are constantly developing in the internal contradictions and struggles of objective things. Rules and regulations are often in a state of being able to correctly reflect objective practice and not being able to correctly reflect objective practice. Over time, originally reasonable rules and regulations will move to their opposite, gradually becoming unreasonable, and will change from promoting the development of productive forces to hindering the development of productive forces. Therefore, we must modify rules and regulations based on the developed objective practice. It is certainly wrong to fail to resolutely reform when it is necessary to reform, and it is also wrong to reform indiscriminately when it is not necessary to reform.
    The purpose of reforming unreasonable rules and regulations is to make them reflect objective practice more correctly and promote the development of productive forces, not to eliminate rules and regulations altogether. Reasonable rules and regulations are not only necessary but should also be observed by everyone. Observing reasonable rules and regulations means acting in accordance with the objective laws of the development of things. Objective laws do not shift according to people's will. People can only master and utilize them to be victorious in every battle and invincible in every attack. If you do not abide by it and go against it, it will not be polite to you. For example, failing to start the machine according to the necessary operating procedures will damage the machine or cause personal accidents; failing to produce according to the necessary technological procedures will result in unqualified product quality. Are there not frequent lessons of this kind? Therefore, in enterprises, having reasonable rules and regulations can help people understand and master the objective laws of the development of things, and can promote the rapid development of productive forces. The Kaishantun Paper Mill reformed unreasonable rules and regulations and formulated new rules and regulations based on the practical experience of advanced workers, and quickly turned the individual advanced production level into the daily production level. This is an example.
    "Two participations, one reform" is an important experience in managing enterprises summarized from practice. "Reform" means reforming unreasonable rules and regulations. We must resolutely implement the spirit of reform and get rid of all unreasonable rules and regulations. However, we must be calm-headed, mobilize the masses, and conduct experiments during the reform process. That is to say, combining revolutionary vigor with scientific analysis, so that the more we reform, the better it gets, and the more production develops.

    谈“改”
    王朴
    观察问题有两种方法，一种是细致的科学分析，一种是简单化的马虎从事。两种方法产生两种效果。如果是前者，经过科学分析，掌握了客观规律，事情就能办得顺顺当当。如果是后者，就可能违反客观规律，事情就会办不通。例如，企业里发动群众，改革不合理的规章制度，是促进生产力发展的大好事，但如果我们简单化地不管是合理的还是不合理的，统统列入改革废除之列，那就不对头了，就会妨碍生产力的发展。
    这就是对问题缺乏科学的分析。我们企业里确实有不少规章制度是束缚生产力发展的，需要坚决地加以改革或者废除，用新的规章制度来代替它。不如此，就会妨碍生产力的继续发展，但也并非任何规章制度都束缚生产力的发展。企业里的规章制度不论有多少种，归纳起来不外两类。一类属于管理制度，它反映企业内部人与人之间的关系，是为经济基础服务的。另一类是反映生产过程的客观规律的，如工艺规程等等。不论是哪一类的，规章制度都是来源于实践，不是人们凭空想出的。只要它们能够正确或者大体正确反映事物发展的客观规律，就可以反过来推动生产力的发展。这些规章制度，就是合理的，应该保持下来，不应改革，更不应废除。而对那些不能正确反映事物发展的客观规律的规章制度，就应根据不同情况大力加以改革或废除。
    同时，一些现在合理的规章制度，由于客观事物在内部的矛盾斗争中不断发展着，规章制度就经常处于能够正确反映客观实践又不能够正确反映客观实践的状态。久而久之，原来是合理的规章制度就会走向它的反面，慢慢变成不合理的，就会从推动生产力的发展变成束缚生产力的发展。因此，我们必须根据发展了的客观实践来修改规章制度。该改而不坚决地改，当然是错误的，不该改而乱改，也是不对的。
    改革不合理的规章制度，目的是使它能更正确地反映客观实践，推动生产力发展，并非不要规章制度。合理的规章制度不仅需要，而且要人人遵守。遵守合理的规章制度，就是按照事物发展的客观规律办事。客观规律是不以人们的意志为转移的，人们只有掌握它，利用它，才是战必胜，攻必克。你不遵守它，反其道而行，它就对你不客气。例如，不按照必要的操作规程开动机器，就会把机器搞坏，或者造成人身事故；不按照必要的工艺规程生产，产品质量就不合格。这类教训，不是经常有吗？所以在企业里，有了合理的规章制度，就可以帮助人们认识和掌握事物发展的客观规律，就可以促进生产力的迅速发展。开山屯造纸厂根据先进工人的实践经验，改革不合理的规章制度，制订新的规章制度，就很快地把个别的先进生产水平变成日常的生产水平。这就是一个例子。
    “两参一改”，这是从实践中总结出来的管理企业的一条重要经验。“改”就是改革不合理的规章制度。我们必须坚决贯彻改的精神，把不合理的规章制度统统改掉，但在改革的时候，头脑要冷静，要发动群众，又要经过试验。这就是说，把革命的干劲和科学的分析结合起来，这样就越改越好，越改生产越发展。
