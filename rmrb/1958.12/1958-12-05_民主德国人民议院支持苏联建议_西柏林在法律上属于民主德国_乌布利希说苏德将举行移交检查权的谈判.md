Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 3rd. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic today passed a declaration supporting the Soviet government's proposals on the Berlin issue.

The declaration said that the Soviet government's notes to various governments on the West Berlin issue demonstrate that: the Western countries have no legal basis to occupy part of the German capital; West Berlin legally belongs to the German Democratic Republic; the people of West Berlin will eventually be able to live and work under normal conditions again; the source of war in the center of Europe must be eliminated.

The declaration said that the basic principles of the German Democratic Republic's policy are to strive to defend European and world peace, to strive to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, to strive to bring the two Germanys closer together through the establishment of a confederation, and to rapidly unify them into a democratic, peace-loving, and independent country. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the Soviet government's proposal to grant West Berlin the status of a free city, and declares that it will faithfully and in accordance with the interests of all residents of Berlin fulfill the functions transferred to the German Democratic Republic by the Soviet Union.

The declaration condemned the United States, Britain, and France for undermining the Potsdam Agreement, evading the obligations stipulated in the agreement to eradicate militarism and fascism, and for continuing to militarily occupy part of the German capital to this day. The declaration said that the three Western powers have turned West Berlin into "the fiftieth state of the United States, a member state of the British Commonwealth, and the second Algerian colony of France," turning it into a base for psychological warfare against the German Democratic Republic, against the Soviet Union, and against the socialist camp.

The declaration also condemned the leaders of the West German and West Berlin parties for following the policies of the Western countries, dividing Germany and leading the residents of West Germany and West Berlin to the brink of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 2nd. "Neues Deutschland" today published the second part of the German Socialist Unity Party Central Committee First Secretary Ulbricht's answers to questions from a "New York Times" reporter on the Berlin issue.

Ulbricht said: "If a referendum could be held in West Berlin on the withdrawal of American, British, and French troops, it would be a very interesting measure. No one would object in the slightest."

Ulbricht said: "The reason why people are demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops is because the stationing and actions of foreign troops contradict the basic principles of the anti-Hitler alliance and the Potsdam Agreement."

An American reporter asked Ulbricht how he viewed the Western countries' reactions to the Soviet note?

Ulbricht said that the people of all countries do not want West Berlin to become a malignant tumor, and the governments of Western countries must see this situation.

Regarding the deadline for talks on the Berlin issue, Ulbricht said: "We hope that the negotiations can lead to understanding within six months. If an agreement is decided, there can of course be negotiations on implementation. But on basic issues, people should reach mutual understanding within these six months. Six months is a long time. During these six months, negotiations will be held between the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic on the transfer of control rights."

When talking about the location of the meeting, he said, "It is best to hold it in Berlin."

Ulbricht refuted the claim that the Potsdam Agreement no longer exists. He said: "Khrushchev did not say that the Potsdam Agreement has been canceled. Although this agreement has been undermined in West Germany, the principles of the Potsdam Agreement are still valid. Because the Western countries refused to implement the Potsdam Agreement in West Germany and West Berlin, the Soviet Union was forced to find a way to reduce the risk of war and put forward its constructive proposals for this purpose."

### 民主德国人民议院支持苏联建议  西柏林在法律上属于民主德国  乌布利希说苏德将举行移交检查权的谈判

    民主德国人民议院支持苏联建议
    西柏林在法律上属于民主德国
    乌布利希说苏德将举行移交检查权的谈判
    新华社柏林3日电  民主德国人民议院今天通过声明，支持苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议。
    声明说，苏联政府就西柏林问题给各国政府的照会表明：西方国家没有任何法律根据占领德国首都的一部分；西柏林在法律上是属于德意志民主共和国的；西柏林人民最终一定能够再次在正常的条件下生活和工作；必须消除欧洲中心的战争策源地。
    声明说，民主德国的政策的基本原则就是为保卫欧洲和世界和平而努力，为缔结对德和约而努力，为争取建立邦联而使两个德国彼此接近，并且使它们迅速统一成为一个民主、爱好和平、独立的国家而努力。因此，民主德国完全同意苏联政府关于使西柏林获得自由城市地位的建议，并且表示将忠实地和按照柏林全体居民的利益来履行苏联移交给民主德国的职权。
    声明谴责美、英、法三国破坏波茨坦协定，逃避履行协定所规定的根除军国主义和法西斯主义的义务，而且直到今天还对德国首都的一部分进行军事占领。声明说，西方三国把西柏林变成了“美国的第五十个州，英联邦的一个成员国，法国的第二个阿尔及利亚殖民地”，变成反对民主德国、反对苏联、反对社会主义阵营的心理战基地。
    声明也谴责了西德和西柏林各政党领袖追随西方国家的、分裂德国并把西德和西柏林的居民引导到战争边缘的政策。
    据新华社柏林2日电  “新德意志报”今天发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希就柏林问题答“纽约时报”记者问的第二部分。
    乌布利希说：“如果能够在西柏林进行一次关于撤退美、英、法军队的公民投票的话，这将是一个非常有趣的措施。没有人会表示半点反对。”
    乌布利希说：“人们所以要求撤退外国军队是因为外国军队的留驻和行动同反希特勒同盟和波茨坦协定的基本原则相矛盾。”
    美国记者问乌布利希如何看待西方国家对苏联照会的反应？
    乌布利希说，各国人民都不愿意使西柏林成为毒瘤，西方国家的政府必须看到这种情况。
    关于柏林问题会谈的期限，乌布利希说：“我们希望谈判在六个月之内就能够导向谅解。如果决定了某一项协定，当然还可以有关于执行方面的谈判。但是关于基本问题，人们则应当在这六个月之内做到互相谅解。六个月是一段长的时间。在这六个月之内，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府之间将举行关于移交检查权利的谈判。”
    他在谈到关于会谈地点时说，“最好在柏林举行。”
    乌布利希驳斥了所谓波茨坦协定已不存在这种说法。他说：“赫鲁晓夫并没有说波茨坦协定已经取消。在西德这个协定虽被破坏，可是波茨坦协定的原则却仍然是有效的。由于西方国家拒绝在西德和西柏林执行波茨坦协定，所以苏联才被迫要寻找一个缩小战争危机的道路，并且为这个目的提出了它的建设性的建议。”（附图片）
