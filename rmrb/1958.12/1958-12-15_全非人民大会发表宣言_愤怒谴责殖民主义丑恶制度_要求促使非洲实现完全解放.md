Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 13th: The full text of the Pan-African People's Conference declaration on imperialism and colonialism, distributed at the Pan-African People's Conference, is as follows:

The Pan-African People's Conference, convened by the preparatory committee composed of the initiating groups, was held in Accra from December 5 to 13, 1958. Participating in the meeting were sixty-two groups representing two hundred million Africans from twenty-eight countries.

The Pan-African People's Conference is filled with a spirit of unity and encouraged by the declarations of independence of some African countries. It also heard alarming reports from representatives of participating groups about the cruel activities of colonialism and imperialism on the African continent.

The conference expresses its angry protest against this ugly system; condemns the criminal system of colonialism and imperialism in the British and French African colonies, which particularly demonstrates its extreme cruelty in Algeria, Cameroon, Central Africa, Kenya, South Africa, Portuguese Angola, Mozambique, Principe and São Tomé, where local residents are under the rule of colonialist and fascist regimes; condemns the exploitation of these regions' natural resources and manpower; condemns the deprivation of human dignity and democratic rights stipulated in the United Nations Charter; condemns apartheid, the reserve system, and all other forms of racial discrimination and skin color segregation; condemns the use of forced labor in regions such as Angola, Mozambique, the Belgian Congo, South Africa, and Southwest Africa; condemns the political policies in regions such as Central Africa and South Africa that use the social principles of apartheid as the foundation for minority rule over the majority; condemns the denial of the best land to Africans while allocating it to European colonialists; condemns the militarization of Africans and the use of African territory for war purposes, particularly in places like Algeria and Kenya.

We have an obligation to completely liberate Africa now, and considering the favorable conditions for free African countries to help dependent countries fight for freedom, we therefore demand that free African countries provide all possible assistance to dependent countries, provide them with training facilities, and abolish all restrictions on travel, residence, and occupation for all Africans within free African countries. We hope to mobilize our human and material resources to promote our social, economic, and political aspirations, and therefore demand that all African countries encourage the teaching of African languages, geography, and history in schools, and support African democratic cultures manifested in systems such as communal land ownership and mutual assistance. We also demand the encouragement of measures that help increase understanding between our countries, such as the exchange of delegations, holding exhibitions, sports events, youth festivals, abolishing tariffs between neighboring countries, and developing trade and transportation facilities.

Demand that independent African countries provide the maximum possible assistance to the people of dependent countries who are struggling against imperialism and colonialism in every possible way, so that they can quickly achieve liberation and join the big family of free and independent African countries.

The Pan-African People's Conference believes that one of the most effective ways to fight against imperialism is through organizing the people and encouraging the democratic rights of assembly, publication, and freedom of action, recognizing direct adult universal suffrage based on one person, one vote, regardless of race, color, creed, and gender, and recognizing the right of majority rule.

Recognizing that national independence can be achieved peacefully in territories where democratic means can be used, we therefore guarantee to support all forms of peaceful action. We also guarantee the same support to those who have no choice but to retaliate against the violence of their rulers and exploiters.

    全非人民大会发表宣言
    愤怒谴责殖民主义丑恶制度
    要求促使非洲实现完全解放
    新华社阿克拉13日电  在全非人民大会上分发的全非人民大会关于帝国主义和殖民主义的宣言全文如下：
    由发起团体组成的筹备委员会召开的全非人民大会，于1958年12月5日到13日在阿克拉举行。参加会议的有代表二十八个国家的两亿非洲人的六十二个团体。
    全非人民大会充满着团结一致的精神，并且受到一些非洲国家宣布独立的鼓舞，还听取了参加团体的代表关于殖民主义和帝国主义在非洲大陆上进行残酷活动的惊人的报告。
    大会对这种丑恶的制度表示愤怒的抗议；谴责在英属和法属非洲殖民地中的殖民主义和帝国主义罪恶制度，这种制度在阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、中非、怯尼亚、南非、葡属安哥拉、莫三鼻给、普林西比和圣多美特别表现了它的极度残酷的形式，在那些地区，当地居民处于殖民主义和法西斯主义政权统治之下；谴责对这些地区的天然资源和人力的剥削；谴责剥夺联合国宪章所规定的人类尊严和民主权利；谴责种族隔离、保留制度以及种族歧视和肤色隔离的其他一切形式；谴责在安哥拉、莫三鼻给、比属刚果、南非和西南非等地区使用强迫劳动；谴责中非和南非等地区以种族隔离的社会原则作为少数统治多数的基础的政治政策；谴责不让非洲人得到最好的土地而把这种土地交给欧洲殖民主义者使用；谴责把非洲人军事化和利用非洲领土作为战争之用，特别是在阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚等地。
    我们有义务在现在完全解放非洲，并且考虑到非洲自由国家帮助附属国家争取自由斗争的有利条件，因此要求非洲自由国家对附属国家提供一切可能的援助，并给予它们训练的方便，以及取消在非洲自由国家内一切非洲人旅行、居住和职业方面的一切限制。我们希望动员我们的人力和物力来促进我们的社会、经济和政治愿望，因此要求一切非洲国家鼓励在学校里教授非洲语文、地理和历史，并且支持表现为共同占有土地和互助等制度的非洲民主文化，我们还要求鼓励有助于增加我们各国之间了解的措施，如互派代表团，举办展览会、运动会、青年联欢节、取消邻国之间的关税，发展贸易和运输便利。
    要求非洲独立国家以一切可能的办法，对正在为反对帝国主义和殖民主义而斗争的附属国人民提供最大限度的援助，从而使他们迅速获得解放，并且参加非洲自由、独立国家的大家庭。
    全非人民大会认为，对帝国主义进行斗争的最有效的办法之一，是通过组织人民和鼓励集会、出版和行动自由的民主权利，承认以一人一票为基础、而不问种族、肤色、信仰和性别的成人直接普选，以及承认多数统治的权利。
    认识到在可以使用民主手段的领土上能够用和平手段实现民族独立，因此保证支持一切方式的和平行动。对于那些为了对付他们的统治者和剥削者的暴力手段而不得不报复的人们，也保证给予同样的支持。
