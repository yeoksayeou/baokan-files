    Recorded Unforgettable Days
    Cadre of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Participating in Labor Training  Li Songzhi
    February 25, 1958
    Today, I arrived at my new home. The aunts and uncles welcomed us as if we were family. In the future, I must honestly train myself through labor and respond to their care and expectations with practical actions. I believe I will definitely fall in love with this place and am determined to dedicate my strength to it!
              February 27
    Tomorrow, I will go to dig a pit, a round trip of more than twenty li, taking dry bread and returning late. This is not something ordinary women can do. The branch secretary, captain, and aunts all tried to stop me from going, but when I thought of Minister Liu's teachings before we left Beijing, "Bite down and persevere, be tempered into steel," I felt strength all over my body. Since I am here for training, I must withstand the test of fire. How can mild fire forge steel?
              March 17
    The tense spring irrigation has lasted for several days. Yesterday it started to rain, and I jumped up with joy. I really want to tell this good news to my friends in Beijing and let them share this happiness, but production and social work are very busy, and there is no time to write letters.
            April 3
    It has been more than a month since I arrived here. Labor is not such a difficult thing. But there are many things to do: eliminating illiteracy, middle school classes, experimental fields, and the problem of San Ge and San Sao's quarrel, I should solve and mediate all of them!
            April 28
    Tomorrow, I will step onto the platform to teach the hardworking and simple peasant brothers, and I feel a little nervous. Preparing the lesson at night instead of attending the production team cadre meeting is naturally a loss, but I hope the first lesson will have a good start.
    Day by day, my relationship with the commune members is getting more harmonious, and I feel very happy. I am proud to be able to contribute to this rural area, which is both a school and a classroom!
            July 12
    The rain keeps falling, destroying our beans and drowning our tobacco. Every rain is not rain, but millions of drops of tears permeating my heart.
          November 27
    Today I learned that I am going back to Beijing soon, how sudden! I am really reluctant to leave this land where we fought alongside the people of Xuchang. How can I bear to leave the Xuchang villages I am familiar with and the dear aunts and uncles?
          November 30
    The day before yesterday, I hesitatingly told my sister-in-law that I was leaving. Before I finished speaking, tears rolled down like broken beads. My sister-in-law was making shoes for me all night and could not be stopped. When I went to the aunt's room, the uncle took out some money to give me as travel expenses, saying that a daughter should be given money when she goes out... I persuaded him in every possible way to put it down.
    Last night, the team invited us to dinner as a farewell. After dinner, San Sao sent me home and cried sadly when she talked about my leaving, asking me what else I needed. Heavens! What else do I need? This sincere friendship is the greatest happiness.
    As soon as I went out in the morning, the aunt hurriedly pulled me to her room and gave me a bowl full of clear stewed chicken soup to eat. It turned out that she was afraid that I had not eaten well last night with so many people, so she stewed two chickens for me overnight. Eating this chicken soup, it was really sweet and sour, sweet because of the aunt's love for me, and sour because I was about to leave the aunt who loved me!

    记下了难忘的日子
    中国农业科学院下放劳动锻炼干部  李松芝
    1958年2月25日
    今天到了新的家。大娘和大爷们像接待亲人一样欢迎我们。今后我一定要老老实实的在劳动中锻炼自己，用实际行动来回答他们的关怀和期望。我相信我一定能爱上这里，也决心为它献出力量！
              2月27日
    明天要去挖坑塘，来回二十多里，捎着干馍早去晚归，这不是一般妇女干得了的。支书、队长和大娘都不让我去，但当一想到我们离开北京前，刘部长说的“咬紧牙关，坚持下去，百炼成钢”的教导，浑身都有了力量。既然是来锻炼的，就得经受烈火的考验。文火怎能炼出钢来呢？
              3月17日
    紧张的春灌连续几天了，昨天开始下雨把我高兴得跳了起来。真想把这喜事告诉在北京的朋友们让他们也分享这种幸福，但是生产和社会工作都很忙，没有时间写信。
            4月3日
    到这里已经一个多月了，劳动并不是那么困难的事。但是应做的事情很多，扫盲、中学班、试验田，还有三哥三嫂吵架的问题，我都应该来解决和排解呀！
            4月28日
    明天，将踏上讲台给勤劳朴实的农民弟兄上课，心里有些紧张。为了备课晚上未参加生产队干部会自然是损失，但我希望第一课就有一个良好的开端。
    一天一天地和社员们感情更融洽了，心情非常愉快。我为自己能在这又是学堂又是课堂的农村贡献一份力量感到自豪！
            7月12日
    雨呀，下个不停，毁了我们的豆子，淹死了我们的烟叶。每一场雨不是雨，而是千万滴泪水渗透了我的心。
          11月27日
    今天知道马上就要回北京，多么突然！将要离开我们和许昌人民一起战斗过的这块土地，真是依依难舍。我所熟悉的许昌村庄和亲爱的大娘、大爷们，我怎么舍得离开他们呢？
          11月30日
    前天，我把要走的事吞吞吐吐地告诉了大嫂，话还未说完，眼泪就像断了线的珠子一样滚出来了。大嫂在连夜为我做鞋，怎么也劝止不住。到大娘房里，大爷拿出几块钱要给我作盘缠，说闺女出门应当给钱……。我好说歹说才给他放下了。
    昨晚队里请我们吃饭饯行。吃完饭三嫂送我回家，谈到我就要走了她又伤心地哭了起来，问我还需要什么东西。天呀！我还需要什么呢？这种至诚的友谊就是最大的幸福。
    清早一出门，大娘急急忙忙拉我到她房里满满盛了一碗清炖鸡汤给我吃。原来她怕我昨天晚上人多没有吃好，回来后连夜又给我炖了二只鸡。吃着这鸡汤，真是又甜又酸，甜的是大娘对我的爱，酸的是就要同爱我的大娘离别！
