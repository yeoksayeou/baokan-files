Building Industry from Scratch
By Our Correspondent Ge Baozhi

In 1958, Albania's industry increased sixteenfold compared to the pre-war year of 1938. This is the best gift the Albanian people can offer to welcome the New Year of 1959.

Sixteenfold is not a simple number; it contains infinite happiness and pride. In the past two years, whether we were visiting Tirana, the capital, or other cities, or visiting construction sites of factories under construction, Albanian comrades often introduced to us: "This is our first hydroelectric power station." "This is our first railway in history." "This is a modern textile factory, cement factory...that we built from scratch." The phrases "from scratch," "the first," and "the first ever" have become the pride and joy of the Albanian people. This feeling is extremely natural.

Let's look at what Albania's industry looked like before liberation: at that time, on this land of more than 28,000 square kilometers, six imperialist powers, including the United States, Britain, France, and Italy, were carrying out greedy plunder and exploitation, and the country's feudal ruler, the Zog dynasty, even presented the rich underground mineral resources as a gift to the imperialists in exchange for their allegiance. The country was extremely poor, and there was no industry to speak of. The so-called mining industry consisted of only a few small mines and oil wells exploited by the imperialists, and 80% of the products were plundered by the Italian fascists; the so-called factories were only some dilapidated oil presses, wineries, and leather factories, which would be more accurately described as workshops. At that time, everything depended on imports, even small things like a button or a pack of matches. Therefore, pre-liberation Albania was called "the most backward and poorest country in Europe."

But since liberation in 1944, only fourteen years have passed, and another picture has appeared on this same land: the people's own mining, petroleum, electricity, textile, food, construction, glass, and tobacco industries have been built from scratch. People have dug up their motherland's treasures from the ground: oil, asphalt, chromium, copper, nickel, iron, and coal; people have used water power to generate cheap electricity; they can eat sugar, canned fish, sweet wine, and chocolate made from beets in their own factories; they can also wear domestically made cotton cloth, wool, leather shoes, and use domestically produced glass, cement, triangles, etc. Albania has changed from a backward agricultural country to an agricultural-industrial country. The proportion of industry in the national economy has increased to 48.9%. When you travel in Albania, you will see many miracles of industrial construction. What used to be a remote mountain range with few people is now being leveled to build the "Marx" hydroelectric power station, which can generate 120 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year; what used to be a swampy area plagued by malaria has now been reclaimed into vast tracts of fertile land, and a sugar factory with an annual output of 10,000 tons has risen from the ground; in the past, a large amount of foreign exchange had to be spent every year to import cloth and woolen fabrics from abroad, but today a complete textile complex factory with an annual output of 20 million meters has been built, and more than 50,000 meters of cotton and wool fabrics are exported every year. When the reporter visited the responsible comrade of the Albanian Ministry of Industry, he told us these contrasting figures with unspeakable joy: calculated at the production speed of 1958, it now only takes six days to produce the cotton textiles that were produced in the whole year of 1938; this year's electricity production in twenty-four point six days is equal to the total electricity production in 1938; according to statistics for the first nine months of this year alone, coal has increased forty-seven times compared to before the war, chromium has increased twenty times, cloth has increased forty-four times, and electricity has increased nine times. In 1938, each person in the country could only get an average of 27 centimeters of cotton cloth, but last year each person had an average of 15 meters, while in Italy and Greece, each person only had 10.5 meters, and in Turkey, each person only had 6.2 meters. This speed of construction is beyond the reach of capitalist countries forever.

The days when the imperialists called Albania not a country, but only "a mark on the map," and vainly attempted to invade and plunder it, are long gone. Socialist Albania will be built even more beautiful and prosperous. The acquisition of this achievement is first and foremost due to the selfless labor of the Albanian people. For fourteen years, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the Albanian people have paid countless blood and sweat for the industrial construction of their motherland. For example, during the period of the first Five-Year Plan, the total investment in the development of the national economy was 20.4 billion lek (Albanian currency), of which industrial investment accounted for 40.5%. This year, the workers have increased the production of products worth more than 2.6 billion lek for the country, and the production of various major industrial sectors has exceeded 1957 in both quantity and quality. For example, the production of chromium and electricity has increased by 20%, and the machinery manufacturing industry has increased by 33%. During the construction of the "Marx" hydroelectric power station, 15,000 outstanding young people and more than 10,000 women responded to the call of the motherland and participated in voluntary labor. The acquisition of this achievement is also inseparable from the assistance of the socialist family, especially the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union provided assistance of 422.2 million rubles. China has granted Albania long-term loans and has also donated 20,000 tons of wheat and 100,000 meters of silk fabrics free of charge.

1959 is the fourth year of Albania's second Five-Year Plan and the 15th anniversary of the founding of the country. According to the plan of the Ministry of Industry, there will be fifty-four large and small industrial and mining projects under construction. A new batch of factories and new mines will appear on this land. A new battle has begun, and a new victory is coming. (Attached picture)

    从无到有地建设工业
    本报记者  戈宝植
    1958年阿尔巴尼亚的工业比战前1938年增加了十六倍，这是阿尔巴尼亚人民迎接1959年新年最好的礼品。
    十六倍并不是一个简单的数字，它包含着无限的幸福和自豪。两年来不管我们在首都地拉那，或者到其他城市去参观，或者访问正在兴建工厂的工地，阿尔巴尼亚同志都常这样地向我们介绍：“这是我们第一座水电站。”“这是我们有史以来的第一条铁路。”“这是我们从无到有建设起来的是现代化的纺织厂、水泥厂……”。“从无到有”、“第一座”、“第一个”这些字已成为阿尔巴尼亚人民的骄傲和自豪，这种感情是极为自然的。
    请看解放前阿尔巴尼亚在工业方面是怎样的一幅图画：当时在这一块二万八千多平方公里的土地上，就有美、英、法、意等六个帝国主义在进行贪婪的掠夺和压榨，而本国的封建统治者——索古王朝更把丰富的地下矿藏作为向帝国主义卖身投靠的献礼，国家陷于极端贫困，根本谈不上有什么工业。所谓的采矿业，只有帝国主义开采的几处不大的矿场和油井，而且80％的产品都被意大利法西斯掠夺走了；所谓的工厂，只是一些破旧的榨油、制酒、皮革厂，把它们说成是作坊那更确切些。当时什么东西都依靠进口，甚至小至一个钮扣，一包火柴，也得靠进口。所以，解放前的阿尔巴尼亚被称为“欧洲最落后最贫穷的国家”。
    可是从1944年解放以来，时间仅仅过去了十四年，依然在这一块土地上，却出现了另一幅景象：已从无到有地建设起人民自己的采矿、石油、电力、纺织、食品、建筑、玻璃、烟草等工业。人们从地下挖出了祖国的宝藏：石油、沥青、铬、铜、镍、铁和煤；人们利用水力发出了廉价的电；能吃到了自己的工厂用甜菜制成的糖、罐头鱼、甜酒和巧克力；也穿上了本国制的棉布、毛料、皮鞋，和用上了本国产品的玻璃、水泥、三角板等。阿尔巴尼亚已从落后的农业国变成了一个农业—工业国。工业在国民经济中的比重增加到了48.9％。当你在阿尔巴尼亚旅行时，你会看到许多建设工业的奇迹。过去是崇山峻岭人迹罕到的深山，现在却开山平路，建起了一年可发电一亿二千万度的“马克思”水电站；过去是疟疾成灾的沼泽地带，现在开出了万顷良田，并且平地升起了年产一万吨的糖厂；过去每年都得花大批的外汇从国外输进布匹、呢绒，而今天已建起了一个完整的年产二千万公尺的纺织联合工厂，并且每年出口棉毛织品五万多公尺。当记者访问阿尔巴尼亚工业部负责同志时，他以说不尽的喜悦告诉我们这些对比的数字：以1958年的生产速度来计算，目前只要六天就可以生产出1938年全年出产的棉纺织品；今年二十四点六天的电产量，就等于1938年全年的产电量；仅今年头九个月的统计，煤就比战前增加了四十七倍，铬增加了二十倍，布匹增加了四十四倍，电力增加了九倍。在1938年全国每个人平均仅能分到二十七公分的棉布，但去年按人口平均每人已得到十五公尺，而在意大利和希腊，每个人仅有十点五公尺，土耳其每人仅能有六点二公尺。这种建设速度，是资本主义国家永远望尘莫及的。
    帝国主义不把阿尔巴尼亚称为国家，只认为是“地图上的一个记号”，而妄想侵吞掠夺的日子早已一去不复返了。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚将建设得更加美丽和繁荣。这种成绩的获得，首先归功于阿尔巴尼亚人民的忘我劳动。十四年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，为祖国的工业建设付出了无数的血汗。如在第一个五年计划时期，发展国民经济的投资共为二百零四亿里克（阿币），其中工业投资就占了40.5％。今年，工人们又为国家增产了价值二十六亿多里克的产品，各主要工业部门的生产在数量和质量上都超过了1957年。如铬和电的生产都增加了20％，机械制造业增加了33％。在建设“马克思”水电站时，曾有一万五千个优秀青年和一万多个妇女响应祖国号召，参加了义务劳动。这种成绩的获得，也是和社会主义大家庭的援助，特别是苏联的无私援助分不开的。苏联给予的援助达四亿二千二百万卢布。中国贷与了阿尔巴尼亚长期贷款，并且曾无偿地赠送了两万吨小麦和十万公尺丝织品。
    1959年是阿尔巴尼亚第二个五年计划的第四年，也是建国十五周年。据工业部计划，动工兴建的大小工矿工程将有五十四个。在这一块土地上，又将出现一批新的工厂，新的矿井。一个新的战斗开始了，也是一个新的胜利即将来临了。（附图片）
