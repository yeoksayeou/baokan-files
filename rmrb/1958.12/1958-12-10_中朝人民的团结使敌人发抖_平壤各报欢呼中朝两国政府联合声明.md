Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 9th: Pyongyang newspapers today published the full text of the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments and published editorials warmly welcoming and supporting the statement.

    The "Labor News" published an editorial entitled "Great Friendship, Unbreakable Unity," stating: "The joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments is not only an important milestone in consolidating and developing the eternal and immortal friendship and unity between the two peoples, but also demonstrates the unbreakable unity and power of the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union, and makes a great contribution to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world."

    The editorial emphasized: "Both sides reiterated in the joint statement their firm and unwavering stance: to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea; to liberate Taiwan and other Chinese coastal islands, and to achieve China's complete unification. This clearly shows that the Chinese and Korean peoples are strongly united in the struggle to consolidate and defend the peace outpost of the East."

    The editorial pointed out: "The Chinese People's Volunteers have voluntarily withdrawn from Korea in accordance with the proposal of the Chinese and Korean governments, creating favorable conditions for resolving the Korean issue. The US imperialist aggressor troops have no reason to continue to賴 (lai, rely/stay) in South Korea."

    The editorial continued to emphasize: "The US aggressors continue to occupy Taiwan, an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China, and are conspiring to create 'two Chinas.' The Korean people fully support the Chinese people in smashing the provocations of US imperialism and in their just struggle to achieve territorial integrity."

    The editorial emphasized that the Chinese and Korean peoples are today closely cooperating and advancing together towards the victory of socialism and communism. This visit to China by the Korean government delegation headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and the exchange of experiences in socialist construction, will greatly contribute to promoting socialist construction in both countries. Strengthening cooperation between the two peoples will achieve greater victories.

    The editorial concluded by emphasizing: "The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples, established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is invincible and cannot be destroyed by any force. This friendship and unity makes the enemy tremble. The eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples will be as evergreen as the pine trees on Mount Paektu, and will last as long as the sun and moon."

    Today's editorial in "Democratic Korea" said that the Korean people warmly welcome and fully support the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments. This historically significant document for the development of friendly relations between China and Korea reflects the sincere will and determination of the Korean people.

    The editorial said: "The experience of the Korean War shows that the friendship and unity between China and Korea not only fully conforms to the wishes of the two peoples, but is also of great significance for safeguarding peace and security in the Far East."

    The editorial pointed out that the resolution of the Chinese and Korean governments to strengthen the friendship and unity between the two countries greatly encourages the enthusiasm of the two peoples in building socialism, and there is no doubt that it will be warmly welcomed by all people who cherish peace and security in the Far East.

    The editorial said: "The unwavering stance of the two governments declared in the joint statement to defend peace is another powerful blow to the US imperialists, who are accustomed to engaging in adventurous and provocative behavior."
