A Red Line Runs Through the Entire Factory
    Wuhan Meat Processing Plant Vigorously Launches Mass Movement for Ideological Production and Cultural All-Round Leap Forward

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 14th dispatch) The Wuhan Meat United Processing Plant, with production as the center, vigorously launched a mass movement, ushering in a new situation of all-round leap forward in ideology, production, and culture.

    Up to November, the factory in meat processing, the processing volume reached 1.36 million heads, over fulfilling the annual plan, costs were reduced by 10.016 million yuan, and the total output value completed 107.3%. At the same time, revolving around the comprehensive utilization and repeated utilization of pork and beef by-products, the principle of "one factory, multiple capabilities, one item, multiple uses, one person, multiple skills" was implemented, and 17 affiliated factories were established. In addition to steel, it can produce nearly a hundred kinds of new products such as cement, internal organ preparations, gelatin, bone meal, sausage casings, pig bristles, toothbrush material, maltose, wine, paper, and meat processing machinery. Eleven products such as artificial serum, liver extract, and blood extract have reached international standards, and the utilization value of pork by-products has reached 43.57% of the cost of white meat; the factory output rate per pig has also reached 98%. The all-round leap forward in production, the comprehensive and repeated utilization of by-products, has also pushed the meat factory from a single meat processing industry to the development of a joint enterprise, while creating conditions for workers to master a variety of technologies.

    With the leap forward in production, a high tide of cultural revolution has formed throughout the factory. From April this year to now, on the basis of eliminating illiteracy, high primary school classes, spare-time secondary technical schools, and meat industry universities have been opened successively, forming a complete spare-time education system from elementary education to higher education, with a total enrollment of more than 2,100 people. At the same time, due to the adoption of the principle of teaching linking production and the capable as teachers, a new situation has emerged where the factory is a school, the workers are students, and they are both workers and students, and also teachers.

    At the same time, the factory has also made proper arrangements for cultural and sports activities, and they regard caring for the cultural and recreational life of employees as an important condition for another leap forward. Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays are for cultural learning, Fridays are for Party, League, and labor union activities, and Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays are for recreational activities. The labor union organizes performances of literary and artistic programs in each workshop and regularly shows movies. The entire factory has organized 50 teams, basically achieving "competitions every day" and "performances every week." Recently, after the entire factory passed the first-level labor and health system and launched sports satellites, it is marching towards the second-level labor and health system and graded athletes. Such a lively, enthusiastic, and energetic all-round leap forward situation has already emerged.

    The emergence of the all-round leap forward situation in ideology, production, and culture in this factory is based on the rectification movement, under the ideological guidance of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, liberating thought, breaking superstitions, and developing under unified understanding. In July this year, the factory Party committee put forward the leap forward goal of "vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization and achieving zero cost for white meat." The entire factory was full of energy, sweeping away the superstition that "pig butchers cannot make medicine," and criticized the saying that "the potential of machines has been exhausted and the level of production cannot be improved." In vigorously developing steel production, it also criticized the idea of "going it alone" and further established the idea of an all-round leap forward. Productivity was greatly liberated, and difficulties such as labor and equipment were easily solved, and various tasks achieved successive victories.

    Relying on the masses in everything and vigorously launching mass movements are the main characteristics of the all-round leap forward of the Meat United Processing Plant. After criticizing the ideas of not believing in the masses and seeing things but not people during the rectification movement, the factory mobilized the masses in everything, whether it was engaging in production, running schools, or engaging in cultural and sports activities, and adopted the method of combining factory-run and mass-run, mass planning, mass design, mass brainstorming, mass management, and mass operation. Facts have proved that as long as we rely on the masses, we can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results; relying on a few people can only be cold, quiet, slow, and costly. In the past, this factory engaged in comprehensive and repeated utilization of pork by-products without mobilizing the masses. In three years, only four kinds of medicinal raw materials were adopted; after mobilizing the masses, 74 kinds of medicines were successfully trial-produced in three months. After the workers' spare-time high primary school was handed over to the workshops and the masses to run, without textbooks, the masses compiled their own textbooks, without teachers, the masses elected their own teachers to teach each other and learn from each other, both teaching and learning, and solving all kinds of problems by themselves.

    一条红线贯穿全厂
    武汉肉类加工厂大搞群众运动思想生产文化全面跃进
    本报武汉14日电  武汉肉类联合加工厂以生产为中心大搞群众运动，出现思想、生产、文化全面跃进的新局面。
    到11月为止，这个厂在肉类加工方面，加工量达到一百三十六万头，超额完成年度计划，成本降低了一千零十六万元，总产值完成107.3％。与此同时，环绕着猪牛副产品的综合利用、反复利用，贯彻了“一厂多能，一物多用，一人多艺”的方针，办起了十七个附属工厂，除钢铁外，可以生产水泥、内脏制剂、明胶、骨粉、肠衣、猪鬃、牙刷料毛、饴糖、酿酒、纸张、肉类机械等近百种新产品。像人造血清、肝原质、血原质等十一种产品达到国际水平，猪副产品的利用价值已达到白肉成本的43.57％；每头猪出厂率也达到98％。生产的全面跃进，副产品综合反复利用，还把肉类厂由单一的肉类加工工业推向联合企业方向发展，同时为工人掌握多种技术创造了条件。
    随着生产的跃进，一个文化革命的高潮在全厂形成。从今年4月到现在，在扫除文盲的基础上，陆续开办了高小班、业余中等技术学校和肉类工业大学，形成了一套由初等教育到高等教育的完整的业余教育体系，入学总人数达到二千一百多人。同时，由于采取了教学联系生产和能者为师的方针，出现了工厂是学校，工人是学生，又是工人又是学生，又是教师的新局面。
    与此同时，在文化体育活动上，这个厂也作了妥善的安排，他们把关心职工的文娱生活看成为跃进再跃进的重要条件。每周一、二、四文化学习，星期五党团工会生活，每周三、六、日文娱活动时间，由工会组成各车间文艺节目会演，定期放映电影。全厂组织了五十个球队，基本上做到“天天有比赛”，“周周有表演”。最近，全厂通过一级劳卫制、放出体育卫星后，正向二级劳卫制和等级运动员进军。这样一个生动活泼、热情洋溢、干劲冲天的全面跃进的局面已经出现。
    这个厂出现思想、生产、文化全面跃进的局面，是在整风运动的基础上，在鼓足干劲、力争上游的思想指导下，解放思想，破除迷信，统一认识的情况下发展起来的。今年7月厂党委提出“大搞综合利用，白肉无成本”的跃进目标，全厂职工干劲冲天，横扫“杀猪的不能制药”的迷信，批驳了“机器潜力挖尽，生产水平无法提高”的说法。在大办钢铁中，又批判了“单打一”的思想，进一步树立了全面跃进的思想，生产力大大解放，劳动力、设备等困难迎刃而解，各项工作节节取胜。
    事事依靠群众，大搞群众运动是肉类联合加工厂全面跃进的主要特点。整风中批判了不相信群众，见物不见人的思想后，这个厂无论搞生产、办学校、搞文体活动，无一不是发动群众，采取厂办与群众办相结合，群众规划、群众设计、群众想办法、群众管、群众办的办法。事实证明，只要依靠群众，就能轰轰烈烈，多快好省；依靠少数人，只能是冷冷清清，少慢差费。以往，这个厂搞猪副产品综合反复利用，没有发动群众，三年来，只采取了四种药物原料；发动群众后，三个月里，试制成功了七十四种药品。职工业余高小交给车间和群众办后，没有课本，群众自己编课本，没有老师，群众自己推举老师互教互学，又教又学，样样问题自己解决。
