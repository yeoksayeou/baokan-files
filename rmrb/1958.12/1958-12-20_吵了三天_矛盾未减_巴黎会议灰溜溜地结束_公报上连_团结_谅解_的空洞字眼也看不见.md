Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's three-day meeting ended gloomily on the afternoon of the 18th in an atmosphere riddled with contradictions and discord. The meeting failed to resolve the many differences openly exposed among the group's member states. The final communiqué adopted at the closing meeting even reversed past practice, omitting even the words "unity" and "understanding," which the group frequently trumpets and flaunts.

The communiqué began by addressing the Berlin issue, but did not propose how to respond to the Soviet Union's suggestions. The communiqué stated: "In the course of a broad study of the international situation, the Council first addressed the Berlin issue. Member states clearly expressed their determination not to succumb to threats. The Council's statement of December 16th expressed their consensus on the Berlin issue." However, the communiqué did not explain whether the countries agreed on how to respond to the Soviet suggestions. As previously reported, the Western countries have different plans and disagree on how to respond to the Soviet suggestions. The communiqué stated: "The Council will continue to pay close attention to this (Berlin) issue and will soon discuss a reply to the Soviet note of November 27."

Apparently deterred by the powerful pressure of international peace forces, the communiqué piously stated that "the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sincerely believe that, in the interests of peace, the outstanding political problems between the free world and the communist world must be resolved fairly." The communiqué stated: "In their view (referring to the member states of the North Atlantic group), the solution of the German problem in connection with European security arrangements and an agreement on supervised disarmament remain essential." However, the communiqué did not touch upon the real reasons why these problems have not been resolved, and did not even mention the series of positive suggestions made by the Soviet Union to seek solutions to these problems, but instead attacked: "The Soviet government has so far ignored the suggestions made by the West on these issues," and expressed "regret."

The communiqué showed the intention to continue expanding armaments and preparing for war. It reiterated that the strategic basis of the North Atlantic Group relies on two factors: one is the "effective defense forces" of Western Europe, and the other is the "nuclear retaliation force" controlled by the United States. The meeting considered it "very necessary to maintain and not slacken the efforts of member states to improve the alliance's defense forces." The communiqué also stated that the countries agreed to "accelerate the realization" of the plan agreed upon by the governments at last year's Council meeting. One of the main contents of this plan is to establish American medium-range missile bases on the territory of various member states in Western Europe. However, this part of the communiqué clearly did not explain the full real picture of the North Atlantic Group in the military field. News indicated that the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Army, American General Norstad, had "excitedly" complained during the discussion of military issues about the procrastination and inadequacy of various member states in expanding their armaments, while many member states worriedly talked about the "extra sacrifices" and "excessive demands of military commanders" brought about by the military plans. France has consistently adopted a "non-cooperative" attitude in implementing the "principally agreed" plan to establish missile bases.

On the two most contentious issues, the communiqué plainly stated that this meeting did not resolve the contradictions between them. The first is the confrontation between Britain, France, and other countries surrounding the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area." On the day before the opening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, the two sides had a major quarrel at the meeting of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," and continued this infighting during this meeting. The meeting communiqué stated: "The Council noted the difficulties encountered in the negotiations to organize economic cooperation between the European Atlantic member states participating in the Common Market and the European Atlantic member states not participating in the Common Market. It believes that it is necessary to establish a multilateral link as soon as possible and expresses the hope that the efforts currently underway to find a solution will be successful."

The second is the so-called issue of strengthening "political consultation," which is the issue of member states quarreling over "leadership." France has been the most vocal in this regard. It demanded that a certain form be used to ensure the establishment of an American, British, and French "three-nation core" in order to share decision-making power with the United States and Britain. When discussing this issue, the communiqué stated that the ministers "studied the issues that the expansion of political consultation must raise. They generally believe that the existing North Atlantic Treaty Organization mechanism is suitable for the needs of the alliance, and that a flexible approach is better than making any explicit regulations."

The communiqué stated that it would "prepare for political consultations in the Council" by "more systematically studying long-term political issues."

The communiqué made no mention at all of the disputes between Britain, Turkey, and Greece within the North Atlantic Group over the Cyprus issue, the disputes between Britain and Iceland over Iceland's fishing range, and other disputes.

The communiqué finally announced that the next meeting of the Council will be held in Washington in early April next year to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of this military group treaty.

### 吵了三天  矛盾未减  巴黎会议灰溜溜地结束  公报上连“团结”“谅解”的空洞字眼也看不见

    吵了三天  矛盾未减
    巴黎会议灰溜溜地结束
    公报上连“团结”“谅解”的空洞字眼也看不见
    新华社19日讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋集团理事会三天的会议18日下午在矛盾重重、离心离德的气氛中黯然结束。会议对于这个集团成员国之间公开暴露的许多分歧没有能够解决。闭幕会议通过的最后公报甚至一反往年惯例，连这个集团经常鼓吹并标榜的“团结”和“谅解”的字眼也没有。
    公报一开始谈到柏林问题，但是没有提出将如何答复苏联的建议。公报说：“在广泛研究国际局势的过程中，理事会首先注意柏林问题。成员国明确表示了它们不向威胁屈服的决心。理事会12月16日的声明表达了它们在柏林问题上的一致意见。”但是，公报没有交代各国在如何答复苏联建议方面意见是否一致。如前报道，由于西方国家各有各的打算，它们在如何答复苏联建议的问题上，意见是分歧的。公报说：“理事会将继续密切注意这个（柏林）问题，并且不久即将讨论对苏联11月27日照会的答复”。
    显然慑于国际和平力量的强大压力，公报冠冕堂皇地表示，“北大西洋公约组织成员国真诚地相信，为了和平的利益，自由世界和共产主义世界之间的悬而未决的政治问题必须得到公平的解决。”公报说：“在它们（指北大西洋集团成员国）看来，同欧洲安全安排相联系的德国问题的解决以及关于有监督的裁军的协议仍然是必不可少的”。但是，公报不接触这些问题没有解决的真正的原因，也根本不提苏联对这些问题曾经提出过一系列谋求解决的积极建议，却攻击：“苏联政府至今一直不理会西方就这些问题提出的建议”，并表示“遗憾”。
    公报表明了要继续扩军备战的意图。它重申北大西洋集团的战略基础依靠两个因素，一是西欧的“有效的防卫部队”，二是美国控制的“核报复力量”。会议认为“非常有必要维持成员国的改进联盟防卫力量的努力，而不能有所松懈”。公报还说，各国同意要“加速实现”去年理事会会议中各国政府所同意的计划。这个计划的主要内容之一就是在西欧各成员国领土上建立美国的中程导弹基地。但是，公报的这一部分显然没有说明北大西洋集团在军事方面的全部真实图景。消息表明，北大西洋集团军总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德在会议讨论军事问题时曾经“激动地”抱怨各成员国在扩军方面的拖沓和不足，而许多成员国则顾虑重重地谈到军事计划带来的“额外牺牲”和“军事司令要求过多”的问题。在实行已经“原则协议”的建立导弹基地的计划方面，法国一直采取“不合作”的态度。
    在两个争吵得最激烈的问题上，公报明白地表示这次会议没有解决相互之间的矛盾。第一是英、法及其他国家围绕着“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”而形成的对垒问题。在北大西洋集团理事会会议开幕的前一天，双方曾经在“欧洲经济合作局”的会议上大打出手，并且在这一次会议过程中继续了这一场恶斗。会议公报说：“理事会注意到为了组织参加共同市场的欧洲大西洋成员国和不参加共同市场的欧洲大西洋成员国之间的经济合作而进行的谈判中所碰到的困难。它认为尽早建立一种多边联系是必要的，并表示希望现在为了求得解决而正在进行的努力将会取得成功。”
    第二是所谓加强“政治协商”的问题，也就是各成员国围绕“领导权”争吵的问题。在这方面闹得不可开交的是法国。它要求用一定的形式保证建立美、英、法“三国核心”，以便同美英分享决策大权。公报在谈到这个问题时说，部长们“研究了扩大政治磋商必然要引起的问题。他们普遍认为，现有的北大西洋公约组织机构适合联盟的需要，采取灵活的方法比作出任何明文规定的效果为好。”
    公报表示将“通过更有系统地研究长期的政治问题”，来“为在理事会中进行政治磋商作准备工作”。
    公报完全没有谈到北大西洋集团内部英国、土耳其和希腊之间关于塞浦路斯问题的争吵、英国和冰岛之间关于冰岛捕鱼范围的争吵以及其他的争执问题。
    公报最后宣布，理事会下一次会议将在明年4月初这个军事集团条约签订十周年时在华盛顿举行。
