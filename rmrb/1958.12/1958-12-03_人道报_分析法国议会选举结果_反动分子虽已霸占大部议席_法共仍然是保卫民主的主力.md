Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 1st: According to results known this morning, ten communists, including Maurice Thorez, François Billoux, and Waldeck Rochet, were elected as members of the French National Assembly.

    "L'Humanité" analyzed the results of yesterday's second round of voting for the National Assembly, emphasizing the danger of a large number of reactionaries and fascists entering the parliament. The "Union for the New Republic" is a far-right fascist party, a direct product of the May 13th military rebellion in Algeria. It has gathered some members of the former French People's Rally and some extremely reactionary figures, and is closely colluding with major banks.

    The newspaper then pointed out: The French Communist Party ranked first among all parties in the first round of voting, facing open or covert alliances, generally including members from the Socialist Party to the extreme right. In some districts, the Socialist Party candidate was the sole candidate representing the reactionaries against the communists. In other places, the Socialist Party's insistence on competing or abandoning the election favored the reactionaries.

    "L'Humanité," discussing the Socialist Party's loss of votes, wrote: Betrayal is of no benefit. The Socialist Party not only lost votes in the first round, but its seats in parliament will also be greatly reduced.

    The newspaper concluded: Due to the shameful electoral system, although the French Communist Party received many votes, it obtained very few seats. Tomorrow's parliament will be the most reactionary parliament in France in a century. The rampant adventurers who will occupy the majority of seats in parliament tomorrow will seriously affect French politics, further aggravate poverty, and impose the burden of war and crisis on the workers. In this situation, it is clearer than ever that the French Communist Party is the main force against reactionaries and the forces of war. The results of the second round of voting themselves show that this force has been consolidated.

    An editorial in Paris' "Les Echos" said: Although there are very few French Communist Party members in parliament, voters who voted for the Communist Party still account for a significant proportion. This is a reality that the victors in yesterday's election must remember tomorrow.

    “人道报”分析法国议会选举结果
    反动分子虽已霸占大部议席  法共仍然是保卫民主的主力
    新华社巴黎1日电  据今晨得悉的结果，包括莫里斯·多列士、弗朗索瓦·皮佑和瓦德克·罗歇在内的十个共产党人当选法国国民议会议员。
    “人道报”分析昨天举行的国民议会选举第二轮投票的结果时强调指出了大批反动分子和法西斯分子进入议会的危险。“保卫新共和联盟”是极右派法西斯政党，它是5月13日阿尔及利亚军事暴乱的直接产物。它纠集了前法兰西人民联盟的一些成员和一些反动透顶的人物，并且同大银行密切勾结。
    报纸接着指出：法国共产党在第一轮投票时在所有政党中居首位，它所面对的是公开或隐蔽的联盟，联盟成员一般说来包括从社会党到极右派的分子。在若干选区内，社会党候选人是代表反动派对付共产党人的唯一候选人。在另外一些地方，社会党的坚持竞选或放弃竞选的做法都有利于反动派。
    “人道报”谈到社会党丧失选票时写道：背叛是没有好处的。社会党不仅在第一轮投票中丧失选票，它在议会的议席也将大大减少。
    报纸最后指出：由于可耻的选举制度，虽然法国共产党得票很多，所得到的议席却很少。明天的议会将是一世纪以来法国最反动的议会。明天将在议会中霸占多数席位的猖狂冒险家们，将严重地影响法国的政治，并且使穷困状态进一步加剧，把战争和危机的重负强加在劳动者身上。在这种情况下，比任何时候都更加明显，法国共产党是反对反动派和战争的力量的主力。第二轮投票的结果本身表明，这个力量得到了巩固。
    巴黎“回声报”的社论说：如果说法国共产党议员已经寥寥无几，但是投共产党的票的选民仍然占重大的比例。这是昨天选举中的胜利者明天必须记取的现实。
