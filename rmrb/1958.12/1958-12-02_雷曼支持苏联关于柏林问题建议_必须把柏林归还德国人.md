Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 30th (TASS dispatch): The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, Lehmann, said that the Soviet proposal regarding the status of West Berlin is in line with the national interests of the German people, as it advocates that Berlin must be returned to the Germans. He said that every German should be concerned with ensuring that West Berlin no longer becomes a front-line city, an obstacle to peace, and a hotbed of unrest.

Lehmann's statement, broadcast by "German Freedom Radio 904," called on West German Social Democrats and trade union members not to retreat in the face of reactionaries and to end hostile propaganda against the German Democratic Republic. Lehmann said: Social Democrats and trade union members should now act in accordance with the demands of millions of working people, so that the West German working class acts in unison, cooperates hand in hand, and reaches mutual understanding with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Free German Trade Union Federation, so that the entire German working class unites. In this way, the forces of peace throughout Germany can prevail and open the way for fruitful negotiations between the two Germanys.

    雷曼支持苏联关于柏林问题建议
    必须把柏林归还德国人
    新华社1日讯  据塔斯社柏林11月30日讯：德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼说，苏联关于西柏林地位问题的建议符合德国人民的民族利益，这表现在：苏联的建议主张必须把柏林归还给德国人。他说，每一个德国人都应当关心，使西柏林不再成为前线城市、和平的障碍物和不安的策源地。
    由“德国九○四自由广播电台”广播的雷曼的声明呼吁西德社会民主党人和工会会员在反动派的面前不再退却，结束对德意志民主共和国进行的敌意宣传。雷曼说：社会民主党人和工会会员现在应当按照千百万劳动群众的要求行动起来，使西德工人阶级一致行动，携手合作，并且同德国统一社会党和自由德国工会联合会取得相互谅解，使整个德国工人阶级团结一致。这样一来，就能够使整个德国的和平力量占优势，并且为两个德国的有成效的谈判打开道路。
