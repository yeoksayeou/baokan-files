According to Henan Daily, Youhe Basic Commune of Hongqi People's Commune in Xinyang County is comprehensively developing livestock and poultry production.

In September, the Youhe Basic Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while vigorously developing steel production, used steel as the key to organize a great leap forward in livestock and poultry production throughout the commune. As of now, it has raised 7,352 cattle, 2,307 sheep, and 45,837 pigs. It has also developed 2,587 rabbits, 39,400 ducks, 106,000 chickens, 2,750 geese, 658 bee colonies, and a large number of fish and silkworms. The development speed of these livestock and poultry is generally about 25% higher than before September, with the highest increase being more than doubled. Due to the large-scale development of livestock and poultry, in the past two months, it has accumulated more than 56.78 million dan of manure; sold 5,450 fat pigs to the state, 24,580 jin of eggs, and a large number of sheep, chickens, ducks, etc.; commune members ate 180,000 jin of pork and 38,550 jin of eggs.

Running collective comprehensive livestock farms is a distinct feature of Youhe Basic Commune's development of livestock and poultry. They have established twenty-one comprehensive livestock farms based on natural environment, feed sources, product distribution, and other conditions. The livestock farms generally achieved "eight groups," namely cattle, sheep, pigs, rabbits, ducks, chickens, geese, and bees. Some farms have also realized "eight factories," namely: non-staple food processing factory, feed crushing factory, fertilizer processing factory, chick and duck hatching factory, milk and goat milk factory, comprehensive experimental factory, and breeding factory.

The large-scale development of livestock and poultry in this basic commune was not smooth sailing. At the beginning, many people did not fully recognize the important significance of large-scale development of livestock and poultry. They said, "This year's grain harvest is great, it doesn't matter whether we engage in diversified operations or not," "We are so busy with large-scale steel production, we don't have time to engage in livestock and poultry." In response to this situation, the Basic Commune Party Committee launched a large-scale debate among the broad masses of cadres and people on "Why should we develop livestock and poultry on a large scale" and "What methods should we use to develop them." By presenting facts and reasoning, the enthusiasm of the masses to run comprehensive livestock farms was greatly enhanced. In just three days, a "Wanji Mountain" (Mountain of Ten Thousand Chickens) was built in the Dongjiahe Comprehensive Livestock Farm.

    游河社办综合畜牧场  家畜家禽样样都发展
    据河南日报消息  信阳县红旗人民公社游河基层社，全面发展家畜家禽生产。
    9月间，中共游河基层社委员会，在大办钢铁的同时，以钢为纲组织了全社家畜家禽生产大跃进。到目前已养牛七千三百五十二头，羊二千三百零七只，猪四万五千八百三十七头，还发展了兔二千五百八十七只，鸭三万九千四百只，鸡十万零六千只，鹅二千七百五十只，蜂六百五十八群，以及大量的鱼、蚕等。这些家畜家禽的发展速度一般都比9月以前增加25％左右，最高的增加到一倍以上。由于家畜家禽的大量发展，近两个多月来就多积厩肥五千六百七十八万担；卖给国家肥猪五千四百五十头，鸡蛋二万四千五百八十斤，还有大量的羊、鸡、鸭等；社员们吃猪肉十八万斤，鸡蛋三万八千五百五十斤。
    举办集体的综合的畜牧场，是游河基层社发展家畜家禽的鲜明特点。他们根据自然环境、饲料来源、产品分配等条件，建立了二十一个综合畜牧场。畜牧场一般都达到了“八群”，即牛群、羊群、猪群、兔群、鸭群、鸡群、鹅群、蜂群。部分场还实现了“八厂”，即：副食品加工厂、饲料粉碎厂、肥料加工厂、小鸡小鸭孵化厂、牛奶和羊奶厂、综合试验厂、良种培育厂。
    这个基层社的家畜家禽大发展并不是一帆风顺的。开始，有许多人对大量发展家畜家禽的重要意义认识不足。说什么：“今年的粮食大丰收了，多种经营搞不搞没有啥”，“大办钢铁这样紧，那有工夫去搞家畜和家禽”。针对这种情况，基层社党委在广大干部和群众中开展了“为什么要大量发展家畜家禽”“用什么办法来发展”的大鸣大放大辩论。通过摆事实讲道理，群众兴办综合畜牧场的情绪高涨起来，只三天的时间，就在董家河综合畜牧场建起了一座万鸡山。
