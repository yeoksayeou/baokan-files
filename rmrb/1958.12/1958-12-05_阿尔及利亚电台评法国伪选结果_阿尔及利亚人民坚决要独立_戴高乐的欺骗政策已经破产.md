Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 3rd: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station broadcast a commentary on the evening of December 2nd, stating that the fact that over 60% of Algerians did not participate in the sham election orchestrated by the French colonial authorities "demonstrates to the world the Algerian people's determination to oppose colonial rule, and shows the bankruptcy of De Gaulle's deceptive policies." The radio station said that due to the Algerian people's opposition, "the list of candidates ultimately had to be put forward by the French occupation army's general staff, which is truly ridiculous."

The commentary stated that the November 30th "election" demonstrated the strength and prestige of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, and also showed the heroic Algerian people's support for their government.

The commentary said that the brave and skilled Algerian National Liberation Army is growing stronger in battle and is receiving support from friendly countries—including the great People's Republic of China—and that it is invincible and cannot be defeated.

The commentary emphasized that the only way out for France is to accept the proposal of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic to hold peace talks in a neutral country in order to comprehensively resolve the Algerian issue.

It also said, "The French government is insane, it insists on not accepting our proposal and insists on continuing this bloody colonialist war, but it cannot escape the fate of failure."

The radio station concluded by saying, "The era when colonialists could do whatever they wanted and force the people of other countries to accept their will is over. Like the great Chinese people and the people of other Asian and African countries that have already been liberated, the Algerian people are bound to have a day of independence and freedom."

    阿尔及利亚电台评法国伪选结果
    阿尔及利亚人民坚决要独立  戴高乐的欺骗政策已经破产
    新华社开罗3日电  阿尔及利亚共和国之声电台2日晚间发表广播评论说，60％以上的阿尔及利亚人没有参加法国殖民当局一手包办的假选举的事实，“向全世界表明了阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民统治的决心，表明了戴高乐欺骗政策的破产。”这家电台说，由于阿尔及利亚人民的反对，“候选人名单最后不得不由法国占领军参谋部提出来，这是多么可笑。”
    评论说，11月30日的“选举”表明了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的力量和威望，也表明了英勇的阿尔及利亚人民对自己政府的拥护。
    评论说，英勇善战的阿尔及利亚民族解放军正愈战愈强，它得到各友好国家——其中包括伟大的中华人民共和国——的支持，它是战无不胜、不可击败的。
    评论强调指出，法国的唯一出路就是接受阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的建议，在中立国举行和谈，以便全面解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    它又说，“法国政府很疯狂，它坚持不接受我们的建议、坚持要继续进行这场血腥的殖民主义战争，但是它无法逃过失败的命运。”
    这家电台最后说，“殖民主义者可以任所欲为、强迫其它国人民接受他们的意志的时代已经过去了。像伟大的中国和其它已经获得解放的亚非各国人民一样，阿尔及利亚人民必然有独立自由的一日。”
