    The New Hometown of "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall"
    By Our Correspondents Xiao Shuying and Wang ZhengGang
    Leaving Yinchuan City through the north gate and following the tree-lined avenue for ten kilometers, you arrive at the Taolin Production Brigade of the Red Flag People's Commune in Helan County. In the distance, you can see a row of neat streets, with new houses on both sides. All have brick foundations, whitewashed walls, and bright, large glass windows. In the open space east of the village, a group of young men speaking in the Shaanxi dialect are singing Ningxia earth-ramming songs, preparing the foundation to build new houses. This is the new village where people who migrated from Nanliu Village, Cangxi Township, Chaoyi County, Shaanxi Province, live, and it is a detachment of the Taolin Brigade of the Red Flag People's Commune.
    The harvest has filled this new village, which is less than a year old, with laughter and song. On this day, the Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe happened to be performing here. The production team leader said: Now we are masters of the autonomous region, and we should see the acrobatic art of our brotherly nationalities, so the whole team has a day off to watch the show. Women and children put on the new floral clothes and new headscarves they made after the harvest, and the old people led their grandchildren. The whole village was bustling, like a fair.
    In the production team's office, grain and cotton were piled high, making it easy to mistake it for a warehouse. A cadre from the county civil affairs section who came with us said: Everything in the team office has a purpose. Look: the cotton piled on the kang is from this year's trial planting. People from Guanzhong are good at growing cotton, but after arriving in Helan County, they doubted the soil quality here and dared not plant cotton. They just casually scattered some seeds on one mu of land as an experiment. Who knew that this one mu of cotton would yield more than one hundred jin of ginned cotton. The half-basket of rice placed at the door is the "satellite" rice released from the newly reclaimed land this year, with an average yield of one thousand and thirty-nine jin per mu.
    Nanliu Village has a total of one hundred and forty-six households, who started moving here gradually from the winter of 1956. Over the past year, with the enthusiastic help of the local Party committee and the masses, they have built more than seventy houses. After settling down, they reclaimed more than one thousand three hundred mu of wasteland this year, planted more than one thousand two hundred mu of rice and more than one hundred mu of wheat. With the help of local Hui and Han farmers, they achieved a bumper harvest of summer and autumn crops. This year, the grain crops on the newly reclaimed land reached an average yield of three hundred and fifty jin per mu.
    After reserving enough grain from this year's harvest for the rations of more than eight hundred and twenty people, livestock feed, and expenses for expanding reproduction next year, they also sold more than thirty thousand jin of surplus grain to the state.
    Cangxi Township in Chaoyi County, Shaanxi Province, is a place surrounded by water on three sides, and the area of arable land cannot be expanded. Because there are many laborers, women used to go to the fields to pick cotton during the busy farming season, and usually stayed at home spinning and weaving. When they first arrived in Helan County, thousands of miles away from their hometown, they saw that the land assigned to Nanliu Village for reclamation was a lake beach, and they were always dissatisfied. They privately said: They are trying to trick us; can good crops grow in a mud pond? They were unwilling to go to the fields. In March of this year, the men were concentrated to repair drainage ditches, and the lake water was quickly drained away. The government sent tractors, and in a few days, the lake beach was turned over, and the golden fertile soil gave off a fragrance under the sun. When the women went to the fields to deliver meals, they held up the yellow soil in their hands and felt that it was finer than the soil in their hometown. This news spread quickly, and the women unanimously put down their spinning wheels and ran to Qingjia Lake, more than ten miles away, to see the fields. On the newly reclaimed land, they discussed: The men are busy digging ditches, building embankments, and repairing drainage ditches, and more than one thousand mu of rice have no fertilizer at all. What to do? Therefore, from teenage girls to old ladies in their sixties, they launched a climax of accumulating and making fertilizer. Without tools for picking up manure, they took out their own dustpans, baskets, baskets, and even bed sheets and door curtains as tools for picking up manure.
    Li Kuisheng from Nanliu Village and Xiang Shengyi, a local Hui, are good friends. This summer, they visited each other more frequently. They themselves said that they were talking about "knowledge." For example, when planting rice, Xiang Shengyi told Li Kuisheng how to manage crops according to the season, helping him quickly become familiar with local conditions and production techniques. Li Kuisheng's wife just came from Shaanxi, and the weather was getting cold. Xiang Shengyi's wife brought a large basket of cabbage, radishes, and spinach that she had grown, and also helped pickle two or three jars of pickles, enough for the Li family to eat for half a year. Li Kuisheng's wife saw that Xiang Shengyi had many children and had not prepared cotton clothes, so she weaved several yards of cloth overnight, cut them out, and sent them over. The Shaanxi immigrants in Nanliu Village and the surrounding local Hui and Han residents cared for and helped each other in this way.
    Due to the stable life after the bumper harvest, and the warm and sincere friendship of the local Hui and Han people towards the immigrants, the people of Nanliu Village deeply fell in love with this place. Old man Li Xiangsheng told us: Everyone is determined to wholeheartedly build their new hometown here, and the plan has been drawn up. Next year, the average yield of grain per mu will be doubled to reach one thousand jin, catching up with the local general cultivated land. He pointed to a large open space outside the glass window and said that next year this village will be expanded to more than three hundred households, becoming one of the key villages of the Red Flag Commune. At present, they have begun to plant trees and afforest the village surroundings. This winter, the commune will also draw a group of laborers to build schools, clubs, and libraries in the village. The village originally had an amateur troupe, which will be greatly expanded, and new props will be added to invigorate the cultural and recreational activities of the whole village.

    塞上江南”的新家乡
    本报记者  萧淑英  王振纲
    出银川市北门，顺着林荫大道走十公里，就到了贺兰县红旗人民公社桃林生产大队。远远看见一排整齐的街道，两旁是一幢幢的新房。都是砖砌墙根，白石灰墙，明亮的大玻璃窗。村东头的空地上，一群操着陕西话的小伙子，唱着宁夏夯歌，正在打地基准备盖新房。这就是从陕西省朝邑县仓西乡南留村迁移到宁夏来的人们居住的新村，是红旗人民公社桃林大队的一个分队。
    丰收使这个诞生还不到一年的新村，充满了欢笑和歌声。这天，正赶上内蒙古杂技团到这里演出。生产队长说：我们如今是自治区的主人了，对兄弟民族的杂技艺术应该见识见识，所以全队放一天假看戏。妇女和孩子们把丰收后新添制的花衣裳和新头巾穿戴上，老人们拉着小孙子，全村熙熙攘攘，像集市一样热闹。
    在生产队办公室里，粮食和棉花堆得满满的，使人很容易误以为是个仓库。同来的一位县民政科的干部说：所有放在队办公室的东西，都有名堂。你们瞧：炕上堆的棉花，是今年试种的。关中人善于种棉花，可是到贺兰县以后，他们怀疑这里土质不好，不敢种棉花，就随便撒了一亩种子作试验，谁知这亩棉花打了一百多斤皮棉。摆在门口的那半笆稻子，是今年新开荒地上放出的水稻“卫星”，平均亩产一千零三十九斤。
    南留村共一百四十六户，是从1956年冬天开始陆续迁到这里的。过去一年中间，他们在当地党委和群众的热情帮助下，盖了七十多座房子。他们居住安定以后，今年开垦了一千三百多亩荒地，种了一千二百多亩水稻和一百多亩麦子，在当地回、汉族农民的帮助下，取得了夏秋两季作物的丰收，今年新开荒地的粮食作物达到平均亩产三百五十斤。
    今年收获的粮食除留够八百二十多人的口粮、牲畜饲料和明年扩大再生产的费用以外，还卖给国家三万斤余粮。
    陕西朝邑县仓西乡是个三面临水的地方，耕地面积无法扩大，因为劳动力多，妇女在农忙时下地摘摘棉花，平时都是关在家里纺线织布。刚到离老家几千里的贺兰县时，她们看见指给南留村开垦的地是一片湖滩，心里老不满意，私下说：这是整咱们呢，泥塘里还能长出好庄稼？都不愿下地。今年3月，男人都集中去修排水沟，湖水很快放掉了，政府派来了拖拉机，几天工夫把湖滩翻了个，金黄色的沃土在太阳底下发出香气。妇女们到田里送饭时，捧起黄土放在手里一捻，觉得比故乡的泥土还细。这个消息不一会就传开了，妇女们不约而同的放下纺车，跑到十里外的庆家湖上看田土了。在新开的荒地上，她们商量：男人都忙着挖渠、筑埂、整修排水沟，一千多亩稻子一点肥料也没有。怎么办？于是，从十几岁的小姑娘直到六十多岁的老太太，掀起了积肥造肥的高潮。没有拾粪工具，便把自己家里的簸箕、筐子、篮子，甚至被单、门帘都拿出来当拾粪工具。
    南留村的李奎生和当地回民向生义是好朋友，今年夏天，彼此走动得更勤了，他们自己说，他们在谈“学问”。比如，种稻子时，向生义按季节来告诉李奎生怎样治理庄稼，帮他很快熟悉当地情况和生产技术。李奎生的妻子刚从陕西来，天便冷了。向生义的妻子便把自己种的白菜、萝卜、菠菜抬了一大筐送去，又帮助腌了两、三缸咸菜，足够李家吃半年。李奎生的妻子见向生义的孩子多，棉衣还没准备好，就连夜织出几丈布，剪裁好了送过去。南留村的陕西移民，和周围当地的回、汉族居民，都是这样互相关心、互相帮助。
    由于丰收以后生活安定，和当地回、汉族人民对于移民热情真挚的友谊，使南留村的人深深爱上了这个地方。李祥生老汉告诉我们：大家都决心全心全意建设这里的新家乡，计划也订好了，明年使粮食产量平均亩产双千斤，赶上当地的一般熟地。他指着玻璃窗外的一大片空地说，明年这个村子要扩大为三百多户，成为红旗公社的重点村庄之一。目前，他们已经开始在村庄周围植树造林，今年冬天，公社还将抽出一批劳动力在村里盖学校、俱乐部和图书馆。村里原有一个业余剧团，要大大扩充，添制些新道具，活跃全村的文化娱乐活动。
