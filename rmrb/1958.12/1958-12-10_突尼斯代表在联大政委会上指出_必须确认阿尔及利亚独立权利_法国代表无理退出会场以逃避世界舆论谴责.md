Xinhua News Agency, December 9th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the Algerian question yesterday.

The three representatives of the Algerian Provisional Government—Minister of Interior Lamine Debaghine, Minister of Finance Ahmed Francis, and Minister of Information Mohamed Yazid—were invited to attend the meeting.

When the Chairman of the Committee announced the beginning of the discussion on the Algerian question, the French representative once again adopted the rude attitude of walking out of the meeting and refusing to participate in the discussion.

The Tunisian representative, Slim, spoke at the meeting. He accused France of disregarding the reality of Algeria, the "far-sighted" French public opinion demanding negotiations, the world public opinion demanding recognition that "Algeria is not France," and even openly ignoring the resolutions of the United Nations.

The Tunisian representative pointed out that the Algerian Provisional Government represents the Algerian people and effectively exercises power in Algeria, controlling many regions of Algeria. He also pointed out that the voting forcibly conducted by France in Algeria using military force is invalid. Algeria is by no means part of French territory.

The Tunisian representative emphasized that the war waged by France in Algeria has crossed the Algerian border, and French troops have invaded Tunisia. France must bear the guilt of invading Algeria's neighbors. This shows that the Algerian question is not an internal affair of France.

Slim demanded that France reconsider its insistence on forcing the Algerian people to surrender.

He said that the logical way to end the war is through political negotiations, "After four years of war, surrender is impossible."

Slim pointed out that the United Nations has a responsibility to make it clear that the solution should be based on the recognition of the Algerian people's natural right to national independence.

After the Tunisian representative spoke, the meeting adjourned and will continue on Tuesday.

Since the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Algerian question in 1955, France has been trying to obstruct the discussion, insisting that it is France's "internal affair" and threatening to withdraw from the meeting. The United States and Britain also support France's position. Nevertheless, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolutions at its eleventh and twelfth sessions, requesting negotiations in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter in order to achieve a peaceful settlement. However, the French government ignored this and continued to intensify its bloody suppression of the Algerian people. Now it is repeating its old tricks, vainly attempting to escape the accusations of the Algerian Provisional Government representatives and the condemnation of world public opinion by refusing to participate in the meeting.

    突尼斯代表在联大政委会上指出
    必须确认阿尔及利亚独立权利
    法国代表无理退出会场以逃避世界舆论谴责
    新华社9日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会昨天开始讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
    阿尔及利亚临时政府的三位代表——内政部长拉明·德巴金、财政部长艾哈迈德·弗朗西斯和宣传部长穆罕默德·亚齐德被邀请参加了会议。
    当委员会主席宣布开始讨论阿尔及利亚问题的时候，法国代表又一次采取了退出会场、拒不参加讨论的横蛮态度。
    突尼斯代表斯陵在会上发了言。他指责法国既不考虑阿尔及利亚的现实，也不考虑要求谈判的“有远见”的法国舆论和要求承认“阿尔及利亚不是法国”的世界舆论，甚至公然无视联合国的决议。
    突尼斯代表指出，阿尔及利亚临时政府代表阿尔及利亚人民，并且有效地在阿尔及利亚行使权力，它控制了阿尔及利亚的许多地区。他还指出，法国用武力在阿尔及利亚强制举行的投票是无效的。阿尔及利亚绝非法国领土的一部分。
    突尼斯代表着重指出，法国在阿尔及利亚推行的战争已经越出了阿尔及利亚边界，法国军队曾经侵入突尼斯。法国必须承担侵犯阿尔及利亚邻国的罪名。这说明，阿尔及利亚问题不是什么法国的内部问题。
    斯陵要求法国重新考虑它硬要阿尔及利亚人民投降的做法。
    他说，结束战争的合乎逻辑的办法是政治谈判，“经过四年的战争，投降是不可能的”。
    斯陵指出，联合国有责任表明，应当以确认阿尔及利亚民族独立的天然权利作为解决办法的基础。
    突尼斯代表发言后，会议休会到星期二再继续进行。
    自从1955年联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题以来，法国一直竭力阻挠问题的讨论，硬说这是法国的“内政”，并且以退出会议相威胁。美国和英国也支持法国的立场。尽管如此，联合国大会在十一届和十二届的会议上还是通过了要求根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则进行谈判以便求得和平解决的决议。但是法国政府置之不理，继续加强对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥镇压。目前它又重施故伎，徒然企图以拒不参加会议的办法来逃避阿尔及利亚临时政府代表的控诉和世界舆论的谴责。
