Simultaneous Development of Five Industries, Blossoming of Diverse Sectors
Shanxi's People's Communes Experience Unprecedented Activity in Diversified Economies

(Our Dispatch) Taiyuan – Since the realization of people's communes in Shanxi Province's rural areas, a tremendous superiority has been demonstrated in production: agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are developing in an all-round way, and diversified management is unprecedentedly active.

Shanxi Province's rural areas realized people's communes in September. Except for the autumn harvest work, which was carried out by the original agricultural cooperatives, work related to next year's production and long-term construction is uniformly arranged by the commune. Because labor and means of production are used more rationally than before, the management of various productions, regardless of scale or speed, greatly exceeds the original situation of the agricultural cooperatives. According to statistics from Shanxi Province's agricultural leadership departments, since the realization of communization, the province has deeply plowed 25 million mu in autumn. Except for southern Shanxi, cultivated land in all regions has been completely plowed, and the quality of cultivated land is better than in any previous year. At present, the more than 10 million mu of wheat seedlings sown by communes throughout the province according to the state plan are growing strong, and communes have universally established responsibility systems and adopted safety measures for winter. In order to strive for an even greater leap forward next year, communes in various localities have launched winter production movements ahead of schedule. Since October, they have accumulated more than 6.9 billion dan of fertilizer, making the province average more than 170 dan per mu of cultivated land, and have built more than 50,000 indigenous fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer factories, vigorously developing fertilizer production. The momentum, scale, progress, and quality of winter capital construction movements have all shown new situations that agricultural cooperatives never had in the past.

In terms of afforestation, communes have more ambitious plans and more distant goals than agricultural cooperatives. Many communes have begun to develop in the direction of "forest mountains in high and distant mountains, orchards in low and near mountains; farmland and riverbanks networked by forests, grape trellises in houses and courtyards," that is, to promote a garden-like landscape. Since autumn, more than 13 million mu of trees have been planted on barren hills and slopes and on cultivated land returned to forestry after the implementation of the "basic farmland" system, exceeding the total afforestation area of the entire year last year.

In many areas, after the establishment of people's communes, the maintenance and breeding of large livestock have seen new development and improvement. In Pu County, in the Lüliang Mountains, where the number of large livestock has increased year by year for the past five years, after the realization of communization, the county's communes have basically achieved the standards of full allocation, full pregnancy, full production, full survival, full fat, and full health. After communization, the collective pig raising business in rural areas has been greatly developed. Yuanqu County, which started earlier, strengthened leadership in the pig raising business after realizing communization, implementing the spirit of collective feeding as the main focus, allowing commune members to continue feeding pigs. In the seventy days after communization, the number of pigs in the county increased by more than 26,000, an increase of 70% compared to before communization.

At present, local party committees and people's communes are vigorously organizing winter sideline production, and some areas have already begun to become active. Ningwu County has currently organized 15,000 people to open small coal mines, burn coke, extract coal tar, repair mountain forests, burn charcoal, dig medicinal materials, and carry out weaving activities. At the same time, they are developing transportation and opening many agricultural and sideline product processing workshops. It is planned to increase sideline income by 2.6 million yuan by the end of the lunar year, and it is planned to take a portion of it and distribute it to commune members so that they can happily celebrate the Spring Festival.

Shanxi Province is located on the Loess Plateau and has not had the habit of raising fish in the past. After cooperativization, successful trials were conducted in Datong, Taiyuan, and other places. According to statistics, the water surface for fish farming, plus the water surface of newly built water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, will reach about 1.5 million mu next year. Many people's communes on the ancient Great Wall fortress in Yanbei have also proposed to let carp settle down on the fortress.

Shanxi Province has many mountainous areas, and the potential for developing diverse economies is very large. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the principle of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations as early as 1952. After cooperativization, with the great development of water conservancy construction, the project of developing fisheries was added, which played a certain role in prospering the economies of various places. However, due to the scattered and small size of agricultural cooperatives, some agricultural cooperatives were busy with grain production and sometimes grasped and sometimes did not grasp diversified management; some agricultural cooperatives had labor and funds but did not have sideline production channels; some agricultural cooperatives had channels but could not take care of funds and labor; therefore, some agricultural cooperatives developed diversified production slowly or could not get it done. After communization, many new favorable conditions were provided for carrying out diversified management. Many communes in various regions have made the plains the main production area for food crops, established large-scale pastures in the hilly areas, and concentrated on developing forestry production in the mountainous areas. Secondly, the organizational structure of the communes is more complete than that of the agricultural cooperatives. Professional personnel are engaged in regular production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and temporary shock activities are also carried out in combination to ensure comprehensive care and development.

    五业并举  五花齐开
    山西各人民公社多种经济空前活跃
    本报讯  山西省农村实现人民公社化以后在生产上显示出巨大的优越性：农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，多种经营空前活跃。
    山西省农村是9月间实现人民公社化的，除了秋收工作是以原农业社为单位进行外，有关明年生产和长期建设性的工作都由公社统一安排进行。由于劳动力和生产资料比以前得到更合理的使用，因而各项生产的经营，无论规模、速度都大大超过了农业社原来的状况。据山西省农业领导部门统计，从实现公社化到目前，全省秋季深翻地已达二千五百万亩，除晋南外，各地区耕地已全部耕完，耕地质量比以往任何一年都好。目前，全省公社按国家计划播种的一千多万亩小麦苗全苗壮，公社又普遍建立起责任制，采取了安全过冬措施。各地公社为争取明年更大跃进，提前开展了冬季生产运动。10月份以来已积肥六十九亿多担，使全省每亩耕地平均到一百七十多担，并建起五万多个土化肥、细菌肥料制造厂，大量开展制肥工作。冬季基本建设运动声势规模、工作进度、规格质量都出现了过去农业社未有过的新局面。
    在植树造林方面，公社比农业社计划更加宏伟，目标更加远大。许多公社开始向“高山远山森林山，低山近山花果山；农田河畔林网化，宅旁庭院葡萄架”园林化的方向发展。从秋季到现在已在荒山荒坡和实行“基本农田”制度后的退耕土地上植树造林一千三百多万亩，超过了去年全年植树造林的总面积。
    许多地区建立人民公社以后，大牲畜的保养和繁殖工作有了新的发展和改进。过去五年内大牲畜数量连年上升的吕梁山区的蒲县，在实现公社化以后，全县公社已基本上达到了全配、全怀、全产、全活、全满膘、全健壮的标准。公社化以后农村集体养猪事业得到突出发展。动手较早的垣曲县在实现公社化后加强养猪事业领导，贯彻集体喂养为主，允许社员继续喂养的精神，公社化后七十天中，全县的养猪数量增加了二万六千多头，比公社化前增加了70％。
    现在各地党委和人民公社正大力组织冬季副业生产，部分地区已开始活跃起来。宁武县目前组织了一万五千人，开办小煤窑、烧焦炭、提炼煤焦油、修整山林、烧木炭、刨药材、进行编织等活动，同时开展运输，并开办了许多农副产品加工作坊。计划到旧历年底增加副业收入二百六十万元，计划拿出一部分发给社员，让他们喜喜欢欢过春节。
    山西省地处黄土高原，过去一向没有养鱼的习惯，合作化以后大同、太原等地试养成功。据统计，现在养鱼的水面加上今冬明春新建水利工程的水面，明年全省养鱼水面将达到一百五十万亩左右。雁北长城古塞上许多人民公社也提出要让鲤鱼在塞上安家落户。
    山西省山区较多，发展多种经济的潜力很大。中共山西省委从1952年就提出了农、林、牧、副综合发展的方针，合作化以后随着水利建设大发展，又增加了发展渔业的项目，这对繁荣各地经济起了一定作用。但是由于农业社分散和过小，有的农业社忙于粮食生产，对多种经营时抓时不抓；有的农业社有劳力有资金但是没有副业生产门路；有的农业社有门路但是资金劳力顾不过来；因此有些农业社经营多种生产发展较慢、或搞不起来。公社化以后为开展多种经营提供了许多新的有利条件。许多地区的公社作到了以平川地作为粮食作物主要产地，在丘陵区建立大型牧场，在山区集中发展林木生产。其次公社组织机构比农业社更加完备，农、林、牧、副、渔各项生产有专业人员进行经常的生产，同时还结合开展临时性的突击活动，保证了全面照顾和发展。  （杨义）
