    Preserve It
    Liu Yu
    After work and labor, or during holidays, people like to prepare a few dishes themselves, or eat some snacks in a restaurant, or have a couple of drinks in a tavern, or sit in a teahouse. These don't cost much, but they bring people great joy.
    There are many famous snacks all over China, which shows that the people of our country have diverse lifestyles and hobbies; these things have become an indispensable part of people's material life. One can imagine, if farmers in Hunan could not eat rice noodles in the market towns, if farmers in Guangxi could not buy Ciba (glutinous rice cake), if farmers in Sichuan had no teahouses to sit in on market days... they would definitely feel a sense of loss and much inconvenience. Precisely because of this, many places have noticed the role of restaurants, teahouses, taverns and various workshops in the market towns, and have preserved and developed them as necessary.郫县 (Pi County) in Sichuan is doing just that. They have preserved restaurants, teahouses, etc., and improved and developed them to better serve the people. This has been warmly welcomed by the masses.
    However, it is worth noting that some places are not like this. They believe that these things are dispensable, and even feel that preserving them is not conducive to the consolidation of public canteens. Therefore, after the establishment of public canteens, they closed down the restaurants and teahouses in the market towns, and the staff were transferred. This approach is obviously detrimental to the lives of the masses. The purpose of our socialist construction is to make people's lives better and more colorful day by day. The practice of abolishing restaurants and teahouses and simplifying life is not in line with this goal. Under the current conditions, canteens can only provide everyone with palatable meals. Therefore, in order to meet the diverse needs of the masses, it is necessary to preserve restaurants, teahouses, etc. in market towns, pay attention to promoting their good aspects and eliminating their bad aspects. This will not affect the consolidation of the canteens at all. On the contrary, it can supplement the shortcomings of the canteens and promote their development.
    There is another benefit to doing so. Our country's culinary art is world-renowned. Preserving famous local snacks and dishes is also preserving an art. Therefore, while concentrating on running public canteens well, it is entirely necessary to preserve restaurants, teahouses, and famous products such as snacks and dishes that are beneficial to people's lives.

    保留下来
    刘于
    人们在工作劳动之后，或是节日假期，亲手做几样小菜，或者到饭馆里吃点小吃，或者到酒馆里喝上两杯，或者到茶馆里坐上一坐，这些都花钱不多，但却给人们带来很大的乐趣。
    在我国各地都有许许多多著名的小吃，这显示了我国人民的生活爱好是多种多样的；这些东西已成为人民物质生活中不可缺少的组成部分。可以设想，要是湖南农民在集镇上吃不到米粉，广西农民买不到慈粑，四川农民逢场天没有茶馆可坐……他们一定会感到若有所失，诸多不便。正因如此，许多地方都注意到集镇上的饭馆、茶馆、酒馆和各种作坊的作用，加以保留和必要的发展。四川郫县就是这样做的，他们把茶馆、饭馆等保留下来，予以提高发展，使之更好地为人民服务。这样受到了人民群众的热烈欢迎。
    但是值得注意的是，也有少数地方不是这样的，他们认为这些东西是可有可无的，甚至感到保留下来对公共食堂巩固不利。因此在成立公共食堂以后，就把集镇上的饭馆、茶馆也停办了，人员调走了。这种做法显然对群众生活是不利的。我们建设社会主义的目的，是为了使人们的生活一天比一天更美好。生活更丰富多彩。取消饭馆、茶馆，把生活简单化的做法是和这一目的不相符合的。目前条件下，食堂还只能供应大家吃到可口的饭菜。因此，适应群众多种多样的需要保留集镇上的饭馆、茶馆等，注意发扬它的好的方面，消除它的不好的方面，这对食堂巩固丝毫不会受到影响。相反的，正可以补充食堂的不足，促进食堂的发展。
    这样做还有一个好处。我国烹调艺术是驰名全世界的，保留各地著名的小吃和名菜，也是保留一种艺术。因此，在集中力量办好公共食堂的同时，对有益于人民生活的饭馆、茶馆和小吃、小菜等名产品，予以保留，完全是必要的。
