At the National Women Builders of Socialism Activists' Representative Conference, there was a 73-year-old poet, Gao Yingxiu, and a 16-year-old poet, Lü Jinzhi. They both spoke at the same day's conference. In their speeches, they recited their poems to the representatives one after another. Everyone warmly applauded them and felt proud that these two farmer poets had emerged from the ranks of working women.

The old and young poets shared a common language in their speeches: I want to sing the praises of the Communist Party, praise our great socialist era, and praise the great people of this era. Whenever these two poets were inspired, they often used this sentence as the theme to express their feelings.

The maiden work of the young poet Lü Jinzhi uses such sincere feelings and moving words to praise the Communist Party:

　　The Communist Party's kindness is long and long, I want to sing, but what should I sing?
　　Like thousands of fresh flowers, each one red and each one fragrant.

Lü Jinzhi was born into a poor peasant family in Chishe Village, Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province. After graduating from elementary school in 1955, she participated in agricultural production at home. Since the Great Leap Forward, she has seen great changes in her hometown, with new people and new things emerging endlessly. "My heart was jumping, and I wanted to write, I wanted to sing," she said, describing her feelings at the time.

In the past year, she has written more than 120 poems. Her poem "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest of Corn" is full of momentum and sincerely expresses the young poet's love for labor and the countryside. The poem reads:

　　The corn grows so tall it pierces the sky, frightening the Jade Emperor into shouting,
　　Peeking through the clouds, thousands upon thousands of corn babies.
　　The peasants are really amazing, each one better than a living immortal,
　　Climbing the corn stalks to descend to earth, in the future I will also be a commune member.

The moving scene of the nationwide steelmaking campaign also touched the young poet's heart and inspired her poetry, and she wrote several poems. One of them reads:

　　When the sun comes out, it shines all over the hills, with gems gleaming everywhere.
　　Carrying it on their backs and carrying it on their shoulders, sweat washes their faces and their hearts are happy.
　　The molten iron roars from the blast furnace, and the waves roll and gleam with silver light.
　　Let's give the American imperialists a bath in molten iron, and everyone claps and laughs.

The poems written by the young poet are widely circulated in her hometown. Blackboards and radio stations frequently publish or broadcast her poems.

Once, she participated in a "Farmers' Poetry Competition" organized by the township club. This poetry competition was held on a moonlit night, with more than seventy farmer poets sitting in the quiet courtyard. When the competition began, the young poet Lü Jinzhi was the first to take the stage. She touched her braids from time to time, a little shy, but her courage was still sufficient. She raised her head to face the moonlight and read her poems. The first was an anti-drought song: "Don't ask for the Dragon King, anger the Jade Emperor, work hard and do it tough, man will conquer nature." Then she read "The Communist Party's Kindness is Long and Long," "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest of Corn," and thirty-five other poems.

That night, a total of more than twenty farmer poets read their works at the meeting. The township head made a summary at the end, praising Lü Jinzhi's poems and calling her the "top scholar."

This time, the young poet Lü Jinzhi came to Beijing to attend the conference, saw the vigorous development of the capital's construction undertakings, and saw more than a thousand female heroes and female models gathering together. Her heart was moved again, and she wrote sixteen poems in less than ten days. There is a poem praising Beijing, with few words, but fully expressing the young poet's love for the capital:

　　Lovely capital Beijing, what verses should I use to sing your praises!
　　Dip dry the seawater, break the tip of the pen, my feelings cannot be fully expressed.

There is also a song praising female heroes and female models, which says in the poem:

　　Sweeter than melons in the melon garden, Beijing today is better than the top scholar.
　　There are always stronger hands among the strong, let's see who can compete for the lead this time.

This young poet works very hard at writing poetry. When she is working, she carries a notebook with her. When she sees good people and good deeds, new and strange things, she writes them down, and then composes poems while working. Sometimes, if she doesn't have time to write during the day, she writes at night, often writing until late at night. Sometimes, for a sentence, for a word, she has to ponder for a long time. If she can't think of it, she runs to the field to take a look and then comes back to write, or simply goes to sleep and writes again the next day, until the meaning she wants to express in a poem is completely written clearly and it rhymes, then she puts down her pen.

                             × × ×

　　The Communist Party is like the sun, Chairman Mao is like our parents,
　　The seeds of culture are sent to the mountains, and the thousand-year-old blind man's eyes light up.
　　Dreaming of Chairman Mao, the sun rises in the middle of the night,
　　Thinking of Chairman Mao while working, strength increases all over the body,
　　With Chairman Mao in China, red flags flutter all over the country.

Gao Yingxiu, the white-haired 73-year-old poet, wrote such verses to thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their kindness.

Gao Yingxiu was originally illiterate and was trampled under the feet of landlords for most of her life in the old society. She became a child bride at the age of nine, married at the age of nineteen, and soon her husband died of illness due to working as a hired laborer for the landlord. In order to survive, she had to swallow her anger and work as a servant for the landlord, until she was over sixty. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, and she saw the blue sky after the clouds cleared away, and life became sweeter and sweeter. From then on, she strongly hoped to learn culture, to recognize a few words, and to write down the Party and Chairman Mao's ocean-deep kindness so that generations to come would know. In 1950, when she was sixty-six years old, the private school in Liutian Village, Deng County, Henan Province, her hometown, was established. She refused to admit that she was old and resolutely signed up to participate in the study. She made a learning pact for herself: "Coming early is glorious, coming late is criticized, ask for leave if you have something to do, be quiet in the classroom, teach others when you know it, listen carefully if you don't know it, three words every day, can speak, write and use." Every day, whether she was working in the fields or eating and sleeping, she always thought about the books she had read and the words she had learned. She also read and wrote when resting on the way to the market. The ground and the walls were all covered with her crooked handwriting. In this way, day after day, to this day, she has recognized more than 2,000 words and has been continuously rated as a learning model in the county, special area, and province. Everyone calls her "Old Red."

From the age of sixty-nine, she began to learn to write poems and couplets. She wrote about what she did, what she saw, and what she thought. Last year, she also learned to paint, using birds and flowers to form each word, writing her created verses and couplets on long scrolls. So far, she has written several diaries and articles, created many poems, and painted more than sixty screen paintings. The walls of her home are often covered with calligraphy and paintings. This year, she was also hired by the People's Commune as an art teacher. Her diaries, poems, and couplets are all filled with love for the Party, Chairman Mao, and the new society. In the autumn of her sixty-ninth year, the village's mutual aid group had a good harvest, and she happily wrote:

　　In August, the autumn harvest is busy, and the five grains are on the threshing floor,
　　Men, women, old and young are working together, threshing millet and sorghum,
　　The winnowing fan blows into large bags, and all kinds of grains are filled to the brim in the warehouse,
　　Hard work yields a good harvest, and this year is even better than in previous years.

This year, various tasks have seen a great leap forward, and the old woman has even more feelings and richer creations, and she has written many poems in succession. When the Party called on the people of the whole country to march towards science and culture, the old poet recalled that in the old society, working people did not study, and studying people did not work, but in the new society, everyone both works and studies, so she wrote:

　　Pick up the tools and work, take out the books and study,
　　Learning follows production, and both grain and culture are harvested.

The Party proposed that the whole Party and the whole people should run iron and steel on a large scale. The peasants of Deng County have opened mines and built furnaces one after another to let the molten iron flow. The old poet helped to make iron on the one hand, and wrote poems to praise it on the other:

　　China has Chairman Mao, he gives the peasants ideas,
　　Mountain stones and river sand are used to make steel, but the peasants put in some effort,
　　Happy to put in effort, a large batch of steel is made,
　　The steel is sent to the factory, and the workers see it and praise it:
　　With this raw material, we can make machines without much effort.

This time, the old poet came to Beijing and saw the beautiful new atmosphere of the capital, so she wrote four lines of poetry to praise it:

　　The General Line shines brightly, the new China has a new atmosphere,
　　The iron juice flows ten thousand miles, washing away the American imperialist jackals.

She also wrote this poem in four screen paintings with birds and sparrows forming the characters and gave them to Comrade Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation.

On December 13, the old poet Gao Yingxiu and the young poet Lü Jinzhi exchanged creative experiences. When the poets met, their poetic inspiration became even stronger. The young poet Lü Jinzhi was eager to go to a school in Beijing to talk about writing poetry, and did not have time to introduce her latest works to the old poet. The old poet Gao Yingxiu wrote two poems to express her feelings about participating in this conference. One is:

　　Coming to Beijing, my heart is really happy,
　　Exchanging new experiences, we must create miracles.

The other is:

　　Coming to Beijing from thousands of miles away, people from all directions are concentrated here,
　　Heroes meet and see each other, like sisters after a few winters.

    诗人兴会更无前
    记全国妇女积极分子代表会议上两位农民诗人
    新华社记者  王濯非  冯代松
    在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议上，有一位七十三岁的老诗人高英秀，还有一位十六岁的小诗人吕金枝，她们俩在同一天的大会上发了言。她们在发言中一首又一首地向代表们朗读了自己的诗歌。大家都热烈地鼓掌欢迎她们，都为劳动妇女中出现了这两位农民诗人而感到自豪。
    老诗人和小诗人的发言中有一句共同的语言：我要歌颂共产党，歌颂我们伟大的社会主义时代，歌颂这个时代的伟大的人。这两位诗人每当诗兴大作时，常常以这句话作主题，来倾吐自己的感情。
    小诗人吕金枝的一篇处女作，就是用这样诚挚的感情和动人的字句来歌颂共产党的：
    共产党恩情长又长，要唱不知唱哪桩？
    好比鲜花千万朵，朵朵红来朵朵香。
    吕金枝生在山西省运城县赤社村一个贫农的家庭里，她从1955年小学毕业后，一直在家里参加农业生产。大跃进以来，她看到家乡面貌发生了很大的变化，新人新事层出不穷，“心里就跳动了，就想写，就想唱。”这是她自己形容当时的心情所说的话。
    一年来，她已写了一百二十多首诗歌。她的一首“庆玉茭丰收”的诗，气势磅礴，真挚地表达了小诗人热爱劳动、热爱农村的感情。这首诗写道：
    玉茭长的戳破天，吓的玉皇直叫唤，
    拨开云层往下望，玉茭娃娃千千万。
    农民真的不简单，个个胜似活神仙，
    攀着玉茭去下凡，今后我也当社员。
    全民大炼钢铁的动人场面，也触动了小诗人的心弦，引起了她的诗兴，她写了好几首诗。其中有一首诗是这样写的：
    太阳一出满山岗，遍地宝石齐发光。
    背的背来担的担，汗珠洗脸心喜欢。
    高炉铁水哗哗响，波浪滚滚闪银光。
    用铁水给美帝洗个澡，大伙拍手哈哈笑。
    小诗人所作的诗歌，在她的家乡里广泛流传着，黑板报、广播台，经常刊载或广播她的诗歌。
    有一次，她参加了乡里俱乐部召开的“农民赛诗会”。这个赛诗会是在一个月夜里举行的，静静的院子里坐着七十多位农民诗人。赛诗会开始了，小诗人吕金枝第一个登上台，她不时地摸着自己的辫子，有点害羞，可是，她的勇气还很足，仰首迎着月光，朗读了自己诗作。第一首是抗旱歌：“不求龙王，气死玉皇，实干硬干，人定胜天。”接着又朗读了“共产党恩情长又长”、“庆玉茭丰收”等三十五首诗歌。
    这天晚上，一共有二十几位农民诗人在会上朗读了自己的作品。乡长最后作总结时，赞扬了吕金枝的诗歌，说她是“头名状元”。
    这次，小诗人吕金枝到北京来开会，看到了首都建设事业的蓬勃发展，看到了一千多名女英雄、女模范欢聚一堂，她的心又动起来了，不到十天就写出十六首诗歌。有一首歌颂北京的诗，笔墨不多，却充分地表达了小诗人热爱首都的感情：
    可爱的首都北京，我该用什么诗句来把你歌颂！
    蘸干海水，写断笔尖，我的心情也表达不尽。
    还有一首是歌颂女英雄、女模范的，诗中说：
    西瓜园里比瓜甜，北京今天比状元。
    强中更有强中手，看谁这次能争先。
    这位小诗人写诗是很用功的。她劳动时，身上带一个笔记本，看到好人好事，新事奇事，都记下来，然后一边劳动，一边编诗。有时，白天没空写，就在晚上写，常常写到深夜。有时，为一句话，为一个字，她都要揣摩半天，有时想不出来，她就跑到庄稼地里看一看再回来写，或干脆睡觉，第二天再写，直到把一首诗中所要表达的意思完全写清楚了，也压韵了，她才搁下笔来。
                             × × ×
    共产党像太阳，毛主席像爹娘，
    文化种子送山岗，千年瞎子眼睛亮。
    梦中想起毛主席，半夜三更太阳起，
    做活想起毛主席，周身上下增气力，
    中国有了毛主席，山南海北飘红旗。
    白发苍苍的七十三岁老诗人高英秀，写下了这样的诗句，感谢党和毛主席给予的恩情。
    高英秀原来一字不识，在旧社会被地主踩在脚底下过了大半辈子。她九岁当童养媳，十九岁结婚，不久丈夫因给地主当长工劳累成疾而死。她为了活下去，只得忍气吞声给地主当仆人，一直熬到六十开外。共产党和毛主席来了，拨开云雾，她才见了青天，日子越过越甜。从那时起，她就强烈地希望学文化，识几个字，把党和毛主席海样深的恩情写下来让世世代代都知道。1950年，她六十六岁，她的家乡河南邓县柳填村办起了民校，她不服老，毅然报名参加学习。她给自己订了个学习公约：“早来是光荣，晚来受批评，有事要请假，课堂要静心，会了教旁人，不会仔细听，每天三个字，会讲会写又会用。”每天，无论是下地生产或吃饭睡觉，她心里都时刻想着读过的书、学过的字，在赶集中途休息时也看书写字，地面上，墙壁上，都被她写上了歪歪扭扭的字迹。就这样日积月累，到如今，她已认得了两千多字，连续被评为县、专区、省的学习模范，人人都叫她“老来红”。
    从六十九岁那年开始，她学着写诗写对联，做什么，见什么，想什么，就写什么。去年，她又学会画画，把她创作的诗句、对联，用雀鸟、花卉组成一个个字，写在长幅屏条上。到现在为止，她已写了好几本日记、文章，创作了许多诗，画了六十多幅屏画，她家里的墙壁上常常是字画连篇，今年，她还被人民公社聘请为美术教师。她的日记、诗歌和对联，都洋溢着热爱党、毛主席和新社会的感情。她六十九岁那年秋天，村里互助组收成很好，她便高兴地写道：
    八月里来秋收忙，五谷粮食上了场，
    男女老少齐动手，打了谷子打高粱，
    风车扇来大袋装，各种粮食倒满仓，
    努力劳动收成好，今年又比往年强。
    今年各项工作大跃进，老人的感想更多，创作更加丰富，连连写了许多首诗。当党号召全国人民向科学文化进军的时候，老诗人想起旧社会劳动人不学习，学习人不劳动，而新社会人人又劳动又学习，于是写道：
    拿起工具就干活，掏出书本就去学，
    学习跟着生产走，粮食文化双丰收。
    党提出全党全民大办钢铁，邓县农民纷纷开矿建炉，让铁水奔流，老诗人一面帮助炼铁，一面又作诗歌颂：
    中国有了毛主席，他给农民出主意，
    山石河沙炼钢铁，不过农民出把力，
    身出气力心欢喜，钢铁炼成一大批，
    钢铁送到工厂里，工人看见直赞美：
    咱们有了这原料，制造机器不费力。
    老诗人这次来北京，看到美丽的首都新气象万万千千，就写了四句诗来赞美：
    总路线放光芒，新中国新气象，
    铁汁奔万里长，冲垮美帝豺狼。
    她并把这首诗用鸟雀组成字写成四幅屏条，送给全国妇联主席蔡畅同志。
    12月13日，老诗人高英秀和小诗人吕金枝在一起交流创作经验。诗人会见，诗兴更浓，小诗人吕金枝因急于到北京一个学校去谈写诗经验，没有来得及把她的最新的作品介绍给老诗人，老诗人高英秀却写了两首，表达她参加这次会议的感想。一首是：
    来到北京地，心里真欢喜，
    交流新经验，定要创奇迹。
    另一首是：
    千里迢迢来北京，四面八方都集中，
    英雄会师见了面，好像姊妹隔几冬。
