Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Treatment for Cervical Cancer
Zhang Zhifen, Associate Professor, Peking Union Medical College Hospital

Actively treating cervical lesions is a positive measure to prevent the occurrence of cervical cancer. However, how to meet the needs of the masses and carry out preventive treatment is a very important issue.

After attending the National Experience Exchange Conference on Technological Revolution in Medicine and Health and visiting the Hall of Traditional Chinese Medicine, I felt that the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine provides us with many ways to solve this problem. For example, Dr. Wang Zhimin's Cervical Pill, Dr. Tian Fengluan's cupping therapy, Shanghai's Honeysuckle Fluid Extract, and acupuncture for cervical erosion all have good curative effects. When we started a preventive treatment clinic on the streets in early October, we adopted these methods. We used Cervical Pills to treat fifty-five cases, one of which has been cured, and eighteen cases have shown significant improvement. The masses are very welcome. We plan to complete the treatment of five hundred and seventy cases by the end of the year and summarize the effects of traditional Chinese medicine.

In order to better learn from the experience of Dr. Wang Zhimin, a special researcher at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, we invite her to the hospital for consultation twice a week. During these two consultations, we select some cases for her to examine and apply medicine, and learn from her experience. Dr. Wang Zhimin is an expert in treating uterine diseases. Her Cervical Pill is a secret recipe passed down for fourteen generations. According to her, this pill can treat erosion, inflammation, trichomoniasis, uterine prolapse, and infertility. We have selected different types of diseases for her to guide the treatment. In our contact, I personally believe that her pelvic examination is very accurate, but the terminology is different from ours. I feel that her experience is very rich. For example, she examined a case of uterine prolapse and thought it was not suitable for her medicine, so she did not apply it. This was mainly because the patient had a history of bleeding, and subsequent biopsies proved that the patient had cervical cancer. Because her medicine only treats inflammation and not cancer, she did not prescribe it. Dr. Wang Zhimin is very sincere. She said that she only knows how to treat diseases and cannot explain the reasoning, and hopes that we can cooperate well with her and summarize the experience. I personally also feel that we should seriously study her experience and summarize it to a theoretical level.

    中西医结合治宫颈癌
    北京协和医院副教授  张茞芬
    对宫颈病变进行积极治疗，是预防宫颈癌发生的积极措施。但是，怎样切合群众的需要，开展预防性的治疗，却是一个很重要的问题。
    我在全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流大会和参观了祖国医学馆后，感到祖国医学宝藏给我们解决这个问题提供了很多途径。例如王志敏大夫的子宫颈丸，田凤鸾大夫的拔火罐，上海的金银花流浸膏和针刺宫颈糜烂，都有很好的疗效。我们于10月初在街道上开展预防性治疗门诊时，就采用了这些办法，应用子宫颈丸治疗五十五例，其中一例已痊愈，十八例病情有显著的好转，群众非常欢迎，我们计划年终完成五百七十例的治疗工作，并进行总结中药的效果。
    为了很好的学习中国医学科学院特约研究员王志敏大夫的经验，我们请她每星期来医院会诊两次。在这两次会诊中，我们选择一些病例请她检查上药，向她学习经验。王志敏大夫是专治子宫疾病的专家。她的子宫颈丸是祖传十四代的秘方。据她说这种药丸可以医治糜烂、炎症、滴虫、子宫脱垂和不育症。我们曾选择了不同的病种请她指导治疗。在我们的接触中，我个人认为她的盆器检查是非常精确的，只是说法和我们不同。我感觉到她的经验非常丰富，例如她看了一个子宫脱垂，认为不对症，不上药。这主要因患者在历史中有出血史，事后经活体检查证明患者有子宫颈癌，因为她的药只治炎症，不治癌症，所以不下药。王志敏大夫很诚恳，她说她只知治病，说不出道理，希望我们能很好和她合作，总结经验。我个人也感觉到应该认真学习她的经验，并把它总结提高到理论的水平。
