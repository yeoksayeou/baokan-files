Mobilize the Masses to Vigorously Develop Cement Production
Zhang Xin, Minister of Industry Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

In the past, Hunan Province had no foundation in the cement industry, and all the cement needed relied on central allocation and support from other provinces. This year, Hunan Province's investment in capital construction has increased more than twofold compared to last year, and many key projects need to be started ahead of schedule, but the supply of cement is seriously insufficient. What should we do? Our approach is to mobilize the masses to vigorously develop cement production while taking steel as the key link and vigorously developing the iron and steel production movement. Over the past few months, we have achieved remarkable results. Currently, more than 240,000 people in the province are involved in cement production, and more than 15,000 large and small cement kilns have been built, with a total cement production of more than 130,000 tons (of which more than 38,000 tons are of 300 grade or higher). It is estimated that 300,000 to 350,000 tons can be produced by the end of the year. The reason why our province's cement production movement can develop widely and rapidly is mainly due to:

I. Resolutely implement the principle of "small-scale, indigenous methods and mass participation". The process of vigorously developing the cement production movement is also a struggle between two roads for developing the cement industry. At the beginning, some people believed that indigenous methods could not produce high-grade cement, and they blindly pursued large-scale and foreign methods. Some people ran around looking for foreign equipment, but did not mobilize the masses. In August, we held an on-site cement production meeting in Zhuzhou, and the fact that high-grade cement was made using indigenous methods shattered the mysterious view of running the cement industry, criticized the erroneous thinking of emphasizing the large and neglecting the small, and waiting and relying, and clarified the principle of "small-scale, indigenous methods and mass participation", and gradually improved on the basis of popularization.

II. Unified arrangement, dedicated personnel responsible, and organization of a dedicated team to lead cement production. Under the circumstance of vigorously developing steel, in order to ensure the completion of cement production tasks, we first determined sixteen counties and cities with less steel production tasks and cement raw materials as the focus of cement production. On the other hand, from the province to the special districts, counties, and even people's communes, cement production headquarters, offices, and production teams were established, with the party committee secretary or a member of the party committee specifically responsible. At the same time, a group of cadres were transferred to factories to serve as party committee secretaries and factory directors, enriching the grassroots level of factories and mines. A total of 6,000 cadres were successively dispatched throughout the province to specifically lead cement production and conduct trial kilns with the masses.

III. Adopt various methods to cultivate technical forces. In order to meet the requirements of the overall flowering of cement production, in addition to sending people to Henan and Shandong to visit and learn, we also adopted methods such as old factories leading new factories, masters leading apprentices, on-site internships, and short-term training to cultivate technical forces. For example, Liling County, with the Wangxian Cement Plant as its base, transferred cadres and workers, brought their own raw materials, and used the method of simultaneous trial production, summarization, factory construction, and training. In less than a month, it trained 710 technical workers. Up to now, more than 7,000 people in the province have basically mastered the techniques of batching, feeding, watching the fire, and simple inspection, ensuring that each key kiln has two or three relatively skilled workers in charge of production.

IV. Grasp equipment, grasp the key, and vigorously carry out technical revolution. Initially, when building large kilns, there was a lack of refractory bricks and iron furnace bars, as well as kiln-building technicians. Operation techniques were also difficult to master, resulting in many defective products and large losses, and the masses lacked confidence in producing high-grade cement. Under this circumstance, the party committees and work teams in various places led the masses to launch a technical innovation movement of "everyone engaged in creation and everyone engaged in invention." In this movement, the broad masses successively created eighteen types of small indigenous kilns. These kilns were not only simple in equipment, easy to operate, quick to build, and low in cost, but many of them could produce high-grade cement. At the same time, the masses also created wooden ball mills, double-cylinder pulverizers and other eleven kinds of crushing machinery, as well as other large quantities of machinery, which increased work efficiency by several to dozens of times, greatly saving manpower.

V. More experiments, looking for experience, breaking through the quality barrier. Initially, due to the lack of testing equipment and some problems in batching, problems such as natural weathering, nodulation, cracks, and poor hardness and stability constantly occurred during calcination. Party committees at all levels, on the one hand, grasped ideological education, and on the other hand, led the masses to conduct repeated experiments and learn from them. In the trial firing process, Liling County prepared 32 kinds of ingredients, fired 33 times, and made more than 60 kinds of test pieces, finally finding four kinds of batching methods for manufacturing 400-grade Portland cement and one kind of 600-grade acid-resistant cement. At the same time, the Provincial Basic Construction Bureau also transferred more than 100 cadres and technicians to various places to help solve quality problems.

Through several months of the "small-scale, indigenous methods and mass participation" movement, our province's cement industry has laid down thousands of points, cultivated a group of technical forces, and gained some experience in leading cement production, laying a preliminary foundation for the future development of the cement industry. The current task is to rectify the existing small-scale, indigenous group production, consolidate it, and improve it, so that it gradually becomes industrialized and based, and pushes cement production to a new stage.

This is a small indigenous vertical cement kiln group built by the employees and masses of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. This type of kiln produces 10 to 20 tons per day and can produce 300 to 350 grade cement.

    发动群众  大搞水泥生产
    中共湖南省委工业部部长  章新
    湖南省水泥工业过去毫无基础，需用的水泥全部依靠中央调进和外省支援。今年湖南省的基本建设投资比去年增加了两倍以上，许多重点工程又需要提前施工，而水泥供应却严重不足。怎么办呢？我们的办法就是在以钢为纲，大搞钢铁生产运动的同时，动员群众大搞水泥生产运动。几个月来，取得了显著的成绩。目前全省投入水泥生产的已有二十四万余人，共建成大、小水泥窑一万五千多座，已生产水泥十三万多吨（其中三百标号以上的三万八千多吨），预计到年底可生产三十万到三十五万吨。我省的水泥生产运动所以能够广泛而迅速的发展，主要是由于：
    一、坚决贯彻了小土群的方针。大搞水泥生产运动的过程，也是发展水泥工业两条道路斗争的过程。开始时，有些人认为土办法不能生产高标号水泥，他们一味求大求洋。有的人为了找洋设备，东奔西跑，却不去发动群众。8月，我们在株洲召开了水泥生产现场会议，用土法制成高标号水泥的事实，打破了办水泥工业的神秘观点，批判了重大轻小和坐待依赖的错误思想，明确了小土群的方针，在普及的基础上逐步提高。
    二、统一安排，专人负责，组织专门领导水泥生产的队伍。在大搞钢铁的情况下，为了保证完成水泥生产任务，我们一方面确定了十六个钢铁生产任务不大、而又有水泥原料的县、市作为生产水泥的重点，一方面从省到专区、县以至人民公社都成立了水泥生产指挥部、办公室和生产小组等机构，由党委书记或党委委员专人负责。同时抽调了一批干部下厂担任党委书记和厂长，充实了厂矿基层。全省先后共抽出六千名干部，具体领导水泥生产，并同群众一起搞试验窑。
    三、采取各种办法，培养技术力量。为了适应水泥生产全面开花的要求，我们除派人到河南、山东去参观学习以外，还采取老厂带新厂、师傅带徒弟和现场实习、短期训练等办法，培养了技术力量。如醴陵县以王仙水泥厂为基地，抽调干部和工人，自带原料，用边试制、边总结、边建厂、边培训的办法，不到一个月，就培养了七百一十个技术工人。到目前止，全省已有七千余人基本上掌握了配料、下料、看火和简单的检验等技术，保证了每个重点窑都有两三个比较熟练的工人掌握生产。
    四、抓设备，抓关键，大搞技术革命。最初，在建大窑时，既缺乏耐火砖和铁炉条，又缺少砌窑技工，操作技术也很难掌握，次品多、损失大，群众对生产高标号水泥信心不足。在这种情况下，各地党委和工作组领导群众展开了一个“人人搞创造、个个搞发明”的技术革新运动。在这个运动中，广大群众先后创造了十八种类型的小土窑，这些窑不仅设备简单，操作容易，建设快，成本低，其中很多种窑都可以生产高标号水泥。同时群众还创造了木制球磨机，双筒粉碎机等十一种粉碎机械，以及其他大量的机械，使工效提高几倍到十几倍，大大节省了人力。
    五、多试验，找经验，攻破质量关。最初，由于缺乏化验设备，在配料方面也有一些问题，因而在煆烧中，不断出现自然风化、结瘤、裂纹，硬性和安定性不强等毛病。各级党委一方面抓紧思想教育，一方面领导群众反复进行试验，从中摸索经验。醴陵县在试烧过程中，共配料三十二种，煆烧三十三次，作出试体六十余种，终于找到了四种制造四百号矽酸盐水泥和一种六百号耐酸水泥的配料方法。同时，省基本建设局又抽调了一百多名干部和技术人员到各地帮助解决质量问题。
    经过几个月的小土群运动，我省水泥工业已经布下了上千个点，培养了一批技术力量，并且取得了一些领导水泥生产的经验，为今后水泥工业的发展打下了初步基础。目前的任务就是把现有的小土群生产整顿一下，巩固下来，提高一步，使之逐步工厂化、基地化，把水泥生产推向新的阶段。（附图片）
