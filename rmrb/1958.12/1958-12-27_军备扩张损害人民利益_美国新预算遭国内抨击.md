Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: President Eisenhower's statement on the 1960 fiscal year budget, issued on the 22nd, has been met with fierce criticism domestically. In this statement, Eisenhower announced that the total expenditure for the next year's budget, which he will submit to Congress next month, would be reduced to approximately $77 billion, while military spending would increase to $42 billion.

American newspapers, in commenting on this statement, emphasized that the military inclination of the new US budget harms the interests of the American people. For example, "The Washington Post and Times Herald," in an editorial titled "An Unbalanced Budget," emphasized that Eisenhower proposed to further increase military spending, which already exceeds more than half of all government expenditures. This would inevitably lead to significant cuts in other areas (such as social welfare). The newspaper accused the government of "intending to do very little or nothing at all in important areas such as education, healthcare, urban renewal, and poverty relief." The newspaper also criticized the government for increasing revenue by raising postal rates and gasoline taxes.

The "Washington Post" pointed out in an editorial on the 23rd that Eisenhower's aim was to "attempt to shift the blame for the almost inevitable unbalanced budget onto the Democratic Congress." The newspaper accused Eisenhower of falsely claiming a balanced budget that was, in fact, impossible to balance, saying: "Concern about inflation, coupled with perhaps a desire to politically woo voters for the 1960 election, has led the President to gamble recklessly with the economy."

Democrats are even more outspoken in their dissatisfaction with Eisenhower's use of the budget issue as a tool for partisan strife. They said angrily that Eisenhower deliberately decided on an expenditure figure that required cuts in domestic programs, knowing full well that the Democratic-controlled Congress would not accept this figure. In this way, his government could later blame the Democrats for enacting the most expensive new programs in peacetime, because many Democrats believe that it is impossible to expect the United States to make "progress" without increasing spending.

    军备扩张损害人民利益
    美国新预算遭国内抨击
    新华社26日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔22日发表的关于1960财政年度预算的声明，在国内遭到激烈的抨击。在这个声明中，艾森豪威尔宣布下月他将向国会提出的下一年度预算的总开支大约缩减为七百七十亿美元，而其中军费开支则增加到四百二十亿美元。
    美国报纸在评论这个声明时强调指出，美国新预算的军事倾向损害美国人民的利益。例如“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在一篇题为“不平衡的预算”的社论中强调指出，艾森豪威尔建议再次增加原来就已经超过了全部政府开支的一半的军事费用。这就不可避免地要大大削减其他项目（如社会福利方面）的开支。报纸指责政府“在教育、保健、城市的改建和救济贫困地区等重要方面，只打算做很少的工作甚至根本不做工作”。报纸还指责政府要用提高邮费和汽油税的办法来增加收入。
    “华盛顿邮报”23日在社论中指出，艾森豪威尔的目的是“企图把几乎不可避免的不平衡的预算的过错推到民主党国会身上”。这家报纸指责艾森豪威尔把事实上不可能平衡的预算硬说成平衡，它说：“担心通货膨胀，加上也许希望为1960年的选举在政治上笼络人心，因此使总统轻率地以经济进行赌博。”
    民主党人对艾森豪威尔把预算问题变成党争工具的这种做法，更是不满之情溢于言表。他们愤愤地说，艾森豪威尔是故意决定一个需要削减国内计划的开支数字，其实他完全知道民主党人控制的国会是不会接受这个数字的。这样，他的政府以后就可以责备民主党人制定了在和平时期花钱最多的新计划，因为许多民主党人都认为，不可能指望美国不增加开支而会取得“进展”。
