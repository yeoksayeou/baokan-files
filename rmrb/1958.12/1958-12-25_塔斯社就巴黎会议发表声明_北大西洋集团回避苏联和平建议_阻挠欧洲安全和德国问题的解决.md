Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd. TASS issued a statement on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's Paris meeting on the 23rd, stating: Facts, whether past or present, prove that the major powers that dominate the affairs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization verbally advocate peace and security, but in reality, they still implement policies that sharpen international relations and worsen the situation in various regions of the world, engaging in a frantic arms race and accumulating nuclear weapons. This can be clearly seen from the communique issued by the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Paris.

The TASS statement said: "From this communique, it can be seen that the main task the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have set for themselves is not to find ways to ease international tension, but to formulate a plan to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's forces, especially to increase nuclear armament and establish more and more nuclear and rocket weapon bases in Western Europe."

The statement pointed out that regarding the North Atlantic Group Council's December meeting, the Soviet government believes that based on the facts of the military bloc's activities, this bloc is an exclusive military organization that is extremely hostile to the interests of peace. It is implementing a policy of expanding armaments and striving to incite the "Cold War" and undermine peaceful cooperation between countries. At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, which just closed on December 18, unsurprisingly, no constructive proposals were put forward aimed at easing international tension and establishing an atmosphere of trust in relations between countries. This meeting once again showed that there is nothing to be found there that could help ease the international situation and stop the "Cold War."

The statement said that the following situation has also drawn people's attention, namely, that in the communique they issued after the meeting, they completely avoided mentioning the fact that the Soviet government, on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, had put forward important suggestions aimed at strengthening peace to the governments of the participating countries of this alliance, such as the proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the Warsaw Treaty participants and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization participants, the recent proposal by the government of the People's Republic of Poland to establish a nuclear weapon and rocket weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and the proposal to reduce the number of foreign troops stationed on the territory of North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and Warsaw Treaty countries (even if the scale is not large at the beginning). Avoiding these suggestions is not accidental.

The TASS statement went on to expose the North Atlantic Group Council meeting, which, in the communique, acknowledged the importance of resolving issues related to European security and the German question, but in reality, obstructed the resolution of these issues. The statement also refuted the communique's insistence that the Soviet government has so far ignored Western proposals for resolving political issues. The statement pointed out that the opposite is true. The Soviet government has carefully studied and evaluated the Western countries' proposals on European issues, striving to find even a little bit in these proposals that would be conducive to strengthening European security and strengthening the cause of peace. But as soon as the Soviet Union accepted these proposals, the Western countries abandoned them.

The statement emphasized that the Soviet Union, faithful to its peaceful policies, will continue to fight to eliminate the "Cold War," to stop the arms race, to ban nuclear weapons, and to fully develop peaceful cooperation between countries.

The statement said that the Soviet government believes that consultations on the urgent issue of European security are of great significance for achieving these lofty goals, and the Soviet government, as well as all member states of the Warsaw Treaty, have more than once proposed that the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization discuss this. As mentioned above, if the member states of the North Atlantic alliance truly hope to resolve political issues and intend to discuss the issue of European security without putting forward the prior resolution of the German question as a condition, then, the Soviet leaders believe that there will be no insurmountable obstacles to the successful resolution of these issues, or at least to the resolution of some of them.

The statement concluded by saying that if this is the case, the Soviet Union will be willing to gather with other relevant countries to discuss these issues. There is no doubt that this effort by countries to ensure European security will be warmly welcomed by the people of all countries.

### 塔斯社就巴黎会议发表声明  北大西洋集团回避苏联和平建议  阻挠欧洲安全和德国问题的解决

    塔斯社就巴黎会议发表声明
    北大西洋集团回避苏联和平建议  阻挠欧洲安全和德国问题的解决
    新华社莫斯科23日电  苏联塔斯社23日就北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议发表声明说：无论是过去或现在的事实都证明：主宰北大西洋公约组织事务的大国口头上主张和平和安全，但是实际上仍然执行这样的政策：时而在世界的这个地区、时而在那个地区使国际关系尖锐化、恶化局势，进行疯狂的军备竞赛和积累核武器。这从最近一次北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议发表的公报中也可以清楚地看出来。
    塔斯社声明说：“从这个公报中可以看出，北大西洋公约组织成员国给自己提出的主要任务不是寻找缓和国际紧张局势的途径，而是制定一项计划来扩大北大西洋公约组织军队、特别是增加原子武装和在西欧建立越来越多的核武器和火箭武器基地。”
    声明指出，关于北大西洋集团理事会12月会议，苏联政府认为依据这个军事集团的活动事实，这个集团是一个排他性的军事组织，它极其敌视和平的利益，它是在执行扩充军备的政策、执行竭力煽起“冷战”和破坏各国之间和平合作的政策的。在刚刚于12月18日闭幕的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议，果然不出所料，没有提出任何旨在缓和国际紧张局势和在各国之间的关系中建立信任气氛的建设性建议。这次会议再次表明，在他们那里找不到一点儿可以有助于缓和国际局势和停止“冷战”的东西。
    声明说，下述情况也引起人们注意，即他们在会议结束之后所发表的公报中完全避而不谈这一事实，苏联政府在北大西洋公约组织理事会会议前夕曾向这个联盟的参加国政府提出旨在加强和平的重要建议，例如，华沙条约参加国和北大西洋公约组织参加国之间缔结不侵犯条约的建议，根据波兰人民共和国政府的建议最近期间在中欧建立无核武器和火箭武器地区的建议，缩减在北大西洋公约组织国家和华沙条约国家领土上驻扎的外国军队人数（开始时哪怕规模不大也行）的建议。回避这些建议并不是偶然的。
    塔斯社声明接着揭露北大西洋集团理事会会议，在公报中承认解决有关欧洲安全问题和德国问题具有重要意义，但是实际上却阻挠对这些问题的解决。声明还驳斥这个公报硬说什么苏联政府直到现在还忽视西方关于解决政治问题的建议。声明指出，事实恰恰相反，苏联政府仔细研究和估计了西方国家关于欧洲问题的建议，竭力在这一些建议中寻找哪怕是一点点有利于加强欧洲安全和加强和平事业的东西。而只要苏联一接受这些建议西方国家就放弃了这些建议。
    声明强调说，忠于自己和平政策的苏联将继续为消除“冷战”，为停止军备竞赛、禁止核武器和全力发展各国之间的和平合作而斗争。
    声明说，苏联政府认为，就欧洲安全的迫切问题进行协商对达到这些崇高的目的有重大意义，而苏联政府以及华沙条约所有成员国不止一次地提出过这样的建议让北大西洋公约组织成员国讨论。如上所述，如果北大西洋联盟成员国真正希望解决政治问题和打算讨论欧洲安全的问题，而不提出首先解决德国问题作为条件的话，那么，苏联领导人认为，在成功地解决这些问题或者至少是解决其中的某些问题方面，将不是有什么不可克服的障碍。
    声明最后说，如果是这样，苏联将愿意同其他有关国家聚会一堂来讨论这些问题。毫无疑问，各国在保障欧洲安全方面的这种努力必将受到所有国家人民的热烈欢迎。
