Strive for a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward
Beijing Municipal Party Committee Sums Up Experience and Deploys Work for Next Year Based on the Spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session

(Our Newspaper) News – The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged plenary session of the Municipal Committee from December 22nd to 29th, conveying and discussing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong. Based on the spirit of the resolutions and instructions, it summarized the achievements and experiences of this year's Great Leap Forward and studied and deployed the work for next year.

Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, conveyed the content of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee at the meeting. Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting, and Liu Ren concluded the session.

After three days of group discussions and two days of plenary discussions, the more than 400 comrades attending the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee into all practical work in Beijing. On the basis of the great victories achieved in various tasks this year, they would continue to exert their utmost efforts, aim high, strive to complete and overfulfill the national economic plan for next year, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than this year.

The comrades attending the meeting conscientiously studied the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee, believing that this resolution clarified a series of issues related to the People's Communes from a theoretical and policy perspective and was a major historical document. The meeting discussed how to implement this resolution in light of Beijing's specific circumstances. The comrades attending the meeting unanimously affirmed that, like other parts of the country, Beijing's communization movement, despite its short duration, has fully demonstrated its great superiority. To systematically summarize the experiences of the People's Communes and promptly address the new issues raised in practice, it is a very important and positive measure to conduct a rectification and consolidation of the communes. The meeting decided to start by organizing cadres from districts, counties, and communes to study the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" to help them improve their theoretical level, correctly grasp the Party's guiding principles for the People's Communes, and rely on them to carry out the rectification work. In the rectification work, the mass line must be implemented. Major issues related to production and livelihood must be discussed and handled with the masses, and any coercive orders and formalism must be opposed. Currently, the district and county Party committees are preparing to conduct pilot projects first to understand the situation and summarize experiences. The Municipal Party Committee has already held training courses to train commune cadres.

The meeting pointed out that developing the production of the communes is the fundamental issue for consolidating the People's Communes. Rectification work must be closely integrated with production work.

This year, Beijing has achieved a flying leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, cultural education, health, and other fields. The total industrial output value is expected to exceed 4.5 billion yuan, more than doubling last year's 2.1 billion yuan. The output of several major products has increased significantly compared to last year: steel increased more than fourfold, pig iron increased by 27%, machine tools increased by 1.1 times, and coal, electricity generation, and cotton yarn all increased by more than 60%. This year's great development of industry is not only reflected in the rapid growth of quantity, but also in the fact that many important products that Beijing could not produce in the past, such as locomotives, automobiles, tractors, rolling equipment, smelting equipment, power generation equipment, precision machine tools, and large machine tools, have now begun to be produced or are being produced in batches. An encouraging industrial capital construction plan is being effectively implemented. The total investment in industrial capital construction for the whole year is equivalent to more than half of the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. Many new factories have been completed and put into production, and a number of backbone industries are being accelerated. In terms of agricultural production, the unit yield of grain has already achieved the target stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule. The People's Communes have played a great role in autumn plowing and planting. This year, the area of autumn plowing has completed about 6 million mu, accounting for about 95% of the total cultivated area, of which 4.5 million mu of basic farmland has been completely deep-plowed to a depth of 1.2 to 1.5 feet. This autumn, 1.5 million mu of wheat has been planted, an increase of 22% compared to 1957, and about half of it has been winter-irrigated and top-dressed. All of these have laid a good foundation for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. With the great development of industrial and agricultural production and capital construction, the number of employed people has increased rapidly. The industrial, transportation, construction industries have increased their staff by 200,000 people, and 140,000 street residents have been organized to participate in production. As a result, people's incomes have increased, and social purchasing power has also greatly increased. The social retail sales in the second half of this year increased by 27% compared to the same period last year. Education, science, culture, health, and other undertakings have also made great progress this year. After the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the "two-anti" movement, and after implementing the Party's general line and the policy of combining education with productive labor, the face of the schools has fundamentally changed. The vast number of teachers and students and intellectuals on other fronts have received profound education and training in labor, and their thoughts and feelings have undergone great changes. The ranks of worker intellectuals are rapidly forming and developing, and many bourgeois intellectuals have also made progress to varying degrees in their self-transformation. The communist consciousness of the masses of the people has rapidly increased, and people from all walks of life have actively participated in various voluntary labor activities and the mass steelmaking movement. Most housewives with labor capacity have been liberated from housework and participated in various productive labor activities. Labor has become a social fashion. The meeting believed that the facts of Beijing's Great Leap Forward this year prove that the Party's general line for socialist construction is completely correct.

On the basis of this year's Great Leap Forward, how can we strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward next year? According to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee and the specific conditions of Beijing, the meeting made arrangements for work in industrial and agricultural production and other aspects. In industry, we must focus on key points and the rational combination of large, medium, and small enterprises. Next year, we must strive for a greater leap forward in basic industries – steel, iron, coal, machinery, and power generation. Production departments, scientific institutions, and universities must further strengthen cooperation, vigorously conduct scientific research, and vigorously promote new technologies and new products, and strive to make significant achievements in cutting-edge science and technology. In terms of industrial layout, new factories should be distributed in a decentralized manner, and some factories should be relocated to the countryside to better integrate the city and the countryside, industry and agriculture. There should be planned and proportional development among various industrial sectors and within industrial sectors; there should be comprehensive and appropriate arrangements between heavy and light industries, between manufacturing and repair industries, and between equipment and supporting facilities, etc., to ensure key points, take care of general aspects, have a clear guiding principle, and promote overall development. Suburban agricultural production should implement the policy of serving the city and the People's Communes implementing both industry and agriculture, and both commodity production and self-sufficiency. According to the unified national plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions, we must simultaneously grasp agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and grasp commune industry. We must vigorously develop the production of non-staple foods such as vegetables and meat, and we must also do a good job in the production of grain, cotton, and oil crops. At present, we must not only seize the winter sideline production, but also do a good job in water conservancy, manure accumulation, and winter management of wheat. To this end, we must make overall arrangements for rural labor. In commerce, we must further improve the work of commodity supply and strengthen the unified management of the market. In culture, health, and sports, we must continue to carry out the patriotic health movement, mass sports activities, and cultural activities to better serve politics and production, and combine them with productive labor and learning, without hindering production and learning. However, we must be realistic, adapt to local conditions, adapt to specific matters, and earnestly implement the mass line.

The meeting pointed out that uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals is a long-term task. After the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, the "two-anti" movement, and teaching reforms, many intellectuals have made progress to varying degrees. We should welcome every progress they make, unite all forces that can be united, and help them make achievements in their work. In school teaching, under the leadership of the Party committee, we should implement the "three-combination" method of working cadres, teachers, and students. In academics, we should adhere to the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend and letting a hundred flowers bloom.

The meeting pointed out that 1959 is the decisive year in the three years of hard struggle. The tasks of industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, and various other tasks in the capital are very arduous. Therefore, 1959 will still be a year of intense struggle. We must not think that we have already leaped to the top and can take a rest. The meeting also pointed out that in the process of work development, there are difficulties. We must, as Chairman Mao taught us, despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically. We must have both soaring revolutionary drive and a spirit of scientific analysis and seeking truth from facts. The whole Party and the whole people must exert their utmost efforts and continue to struggle hard to achieve a greater leap forward.

The meeting required Party committees at all levels to comprehensively grasp ideology, production, and livelihood. The meeting pointed out that we must currently take good care of the masses' lives, including their material and cultural lives, and we must gradually improve people's lives on the basis of developing production. However, improving lives must be based on objectively possible conditions and must not be separated from production and one-sidedly emphasize life. During the three years of hard struggle, we must still pay attention to carrying out education on hard work, thrift, and simplicity among the masses.

The meeting required Party committees at all levels to effectively strengthen unified leadership and overall arrangements for various tasks and pay attention to implementing the system of requesting instructions and reporting. In the arrangement of work, we must pay attention to being both intense and orderly, combining hard struggle with rest and reorganization, and carrying out activities rhythmically so that the working people can engage in labor and learning with full spirits and a happy mood.

The meeting pointed out that the new year is about to arrive. Facing us are great and arduous tasks. A new, more intense, and larger-scale battle is about to begin. Leading organs and grassroots units at all levels must seize this valuable moment before the war, and well lead and master the central government's instructions and policies, unify and improve understanding, further mobilize the masses, summarize experiences, rectify the ranks, and lay a solid foundation for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

    争取更大更好更全面的跃进
    北京市委根据六中全会精神总结经验部署明年工作
    本报讯  中共北京市委在12月22日到29日举行了市委全体（扩大）会议，传达和讨论了党的八届六中全会的决议和毛泽东同志的指示，并且根据决议和指示的精神，总结了今年大跃进的成绩和经验，研究和部署了明年的工作。
    市委第二书记刘仁同志在会上传达了八届六中全会的内容，市委第一书记彭真同志在会上作了重要讲话，最后由刘仁同志做了总结。
    会议经过三天的小组讨论和两天的大会讨论，到会的四百多人一致表示要把八届六中全会的精神，坚决贯彻到北京市的各项实际工作中去，在今年各项工作取得伟大胜利的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，争取完成和超额完成明年的国民经济计划，争取实现比今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
  到会的同志认真学习了八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，认为这个决议从理论上和政策上阐明了有关人民公社的一系列的问题，是一个重大的历史性的文件。会议联系北京市的具体情况，讨论了如何贯彻执行这个决议的问题。到会的同志一致肯定，同全国其他各地一样，北京市的公社化运动，尽管时间还很短，已经充分显示出它的极大的优越性。为了系统地总结人民公社的经验，及时解决实践过程中所提出的若干新问题，对公社进行一次整顿和巩固工作，是一个十分重要的积极措施。会议决定从组织区县和公社的干部学习“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”入手，帮助他们提高理论水平，正确地掌握党对人民公社的指导方针，依靠他们去进行整社工作。在整社工作中，要贯彻执行群众路线，有关生产、生活的重大问题，必须同群众商量办理，反对任何强迫命令和形式主义的作法。现在，各区委、县委已经准备先进行试点工作，借以了解情况，总结经验。市委已经举办了训练班，训练公社干部。
    会议指出，发展公社的生产，是巩固人民公社的根本问题。整社工作必须紧密地结合生产工作去进行。
    今年北京市的工农业生产、文化教育卫生和其他方面的工作，都获得了飞跃的发展。工业总产值预计将超过四十五亿元，比去年的二十一亿元增长了一倍多。几项主要产品的产量比去年都有很大的增长，钢增长四倍多，生铁增长27％，机床增长一点一倍，煤、发电量和棉纱都增长了60％以上。今年工业的大发展，不仅表现在数量的急速增长上，而且不少过去北京不能生产的重要产品，例如机车、汽车、拖拉机、压延设备、冶炼设备、发电设备和精密机床、大型机床等，现在已经开始生产或者成批生产了。一个鼓舞人心的工业基本建设计划正在有效地实现着。全年工业基本建设投资总额相当于第一个五年计划投资总额的一半还多，许多新工厂已经建成并投入生产，一批骨干工业正在加紧建设。农业生产方面，粮食的单位产量已经提前九年实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的指标。人民公社在秋耕秋种中发挥了极大的优越性，今年秋翻地面积已经完成六百万亩左右，占耕地总面积的95％左右，其中基本农田四百五十万亩，已经全部深翻一尺二寸到一尺五寸。今年秋季种麦一百五十万亩，比1957年增加22％，并且有一半左右已经进行了冬灌和追肥。所有这些，都为明年农业生产更大的跃进奠定了良好的基础。随着工农业生产和基本建设的大发展，就业人数迅速增加，工业、交通运输业、建筑业增加职工二十万人，街道居民组织起来参加生产的有十四万人，因而人民的收入增加了，社会购买力也大大提高了，今年下半年社会零售额比去年同期增加了27％。教育、科学、文化、卫生等事业，今年也都有很大的进步。经过整风、反右派斗争和双反运动，经过贯彻执行党的总路线和教育同生产劳动相结合的方针，学校面貌已经根本改观，广大师生和其他战线上的知识分子，在劳动中受到了深刻的教育和锻炼，思想感情有了很大的变化。工人阶级知识分子队伍正在迅速地形成和发展，很多资产阶级知识分子在自我改造中也都有程度不同的进步。人民群众的共产主义觉悟迅速提高，各阶层群众积极参加各项义务劳动和全民炼钢运动。大多数有劳动能力的家庭妇女，已经从家务劳动中解放出来参加各种生产劳动。劳动已经成为社会风尚。会议认为，今年北京市大跃进的事实证明：党的社会主义建设总路线是完全正确的。
    在今年大跃进的基础上，如何争取明年更大、更好、更全面的跃进？根据八届六中全会的精神和北京市的具体情况，会议对工农业生产等方面的工作作了安排。工业方面要抓重点，抓大中小企业的合理结合。明年在基本工业——钢、铁、煤、机械、发电等方面要力争更大的跃进。生产部门和科学机关、高等学校要进一步加强协作，大搞科学研究、大抓新技术、新产品，争取在尖端科学技术方面做出显著的成绩。在工业布局上，新工厂要分散布置，迁移一部分工厂下乡，使城市和乡村、工业和农业更好地结合起来，在各工业部门之间和工业部门的内部，要有计划按比例地发展；在重工业和轻工业之间，制造工业和修理工业之间，设备和配套之间等等，都要有全面的适当的安排，保证重点，照顾一般，有纲有目，纲举目张。郊区农业生产应该贯彻执行为城市服务和人民公社实行工农业并举、商品生产和自给性生产并举的方针，根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，一手抓农林牧副渔，一手抓公社工业。既要大力发展蔬菜、肉类等副食品的生产，又要搞好粮食、棉花、油料的生产。当前既要抓紧冬季的副业生产，又要搞好水利、积肥和小麦的越冬管理。为此，必须统筹安排农村的劳动力。商业方面，要进一步改进商品供应工作，加强对市场的统一管理。文化、卫生、体育方面，仍旧要开展爱国卫生运动、群众性的体育活动和文化活动，更好地为政治为生产服务，并且同生产劳动和学习相结合，而不应该妨碍生产的学习，但是必须实事求是、因地制宜、因事制宜，切实贯彻执行群众路线。
    会议指出，对知识分子的团结、教育和改造，是一个长期的任务。经过整风、反右派斗争和双反运动、教学改革，很多知识分子都有程度不同的进步。我们应该欢迎他们的每一个进步，要团结一切可能团结的力量，帮助他们在工作上做出成绩来。在学校教学中，在党委领导下要实行工作干部、教师、学生“三结合”的办法，在学术上应该坚持百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针。
    会议指出，1959年是苦战三年中的决定性的一年。首都工农业生产、基本建设和各项工作任务是十分繁重的。因此，1959年仍然是紧张战斗的一年，不能以为现在已经跃进到顶了，可以歇一歇了。会议同时指出，在工作发展的过程中，不是没有困难的，我们必须像毛主席所教导的，在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难。既要有冲天的革命干劲，又要有科学分析、实事求是的精神。全党全民必须鼓足干劲继续苦战，争取更大的跃进。
    会议要求各级党委必须全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。会议指出，当前必须很好地关心群众生活，包括物质生活和文化生活，并且必须在发展生产的基础上逐步改善人民的生活。但是，改善生活必须根据客观可能的条件，不能脱离生产片面强调生活。在苦战三年期间，仍然必须在群众中注意进行艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的教育。
    会议要求各级党委切实加强对各项工作的统一领导和统筹安排，并且注意执行请示报告制度。在工作安排上，要注意做到又紧张，又有秩序，把苦战同休整相结合，有节奏地进行活动，使劳动人民精神饱满地心情愉快地从事劳动和学习。
    会议指出，新的一年就要到来了，放在我们面前的是伟大而艰巨的任务，新的更紧张更大规模的战斗就要开始了，各级领导机关和基层单位必须抓紧这个大战前的宝贵时刻，很好地领导和掌握中央的指示和方针，统一和提高认识，进一步地发动群众，总结经验，整顿队伍，为1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进打好基础。
