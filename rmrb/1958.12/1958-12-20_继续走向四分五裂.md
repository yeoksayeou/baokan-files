　　Continuing Towards Fragmentation
　　By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
　　The three-day North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting ended ignominiously on the 18th. The antagonism and struggle between the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany ran through the entire process of the Paris meeting.

　　The United States originally intended to use this meeting to put pressure on Western European countries, forcing them to agree to establish U.S. missile bases on their territories and to rapidly increase the ground forces of the North Atlantic group from twenty-three divisions to thirty divisions. In order to dilute or mask the increasingly acute contradictions within the group, the United States also intended to "unify" its will and "unite" its internal forces by rejecting the Soviet Union's proposals on the Berlin issue.

　　The Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group, U.S. General Norstad, played an important role at the conference. He criticized almost all Western European countries, including Britain, and accused them of not fulfilling their due responsibilities for "common defense." Although the meeting was secret, it is believed that France's transfer of its armed forces from Western Europe to Algeria was undoubtedly the main target of Norstad's accusations.

　　The United States did not expect France to return a punch so impolitely. France proposed that if missile bases were to be established and nuclear warheads stored on its territory, they must be placed under French control. Everyone knows that France's demand to share the leadership of the North Atlantic Group has always been met with indifference from Washington and London. The Paris meeting provided de Gaulle with an excellent opportunity to force the U.S. and Britain to make concessions. The "Daily Express" revealed that de Gaulle's show was intended to force Britain and the United States to agree that Washington and London should consult with Paris before deciding on major diplomatic actions and to confirm that the transfer of French troops from Western Europe to North Africa was an "important flank to defend the North Atlantic Treaty."

　　When discussing military issues, differences appeared not only between the United States and France. Britain "expressed doubts" about the method of estimating current military needs. The past procedure was: commanders at all levels put forward plans, which were reviewed by the permanent committee in Washington. Britain demanded "political review above the military institutions." The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg stated that small countries were unable to afford certain "defenses." Britain's attempt to use the Paris meeting to break the deadlock on trade issues (or at least ease the atmosphere) also failed completely. Lloyd and de Gaulle held "ninety minutes of icy negotiations" ("Daily Express"), with de Gaulle only expressing that he would review Britain's proposals "in good faith."

　　Contrary to what the United States originally envisioned, the Paris meeting failed to conceal the divisions within the North Atlantic Group on the Berlin issue. The communiqué of the 16th meeting was delayed for two hours due to debate over a clause in the communiqué (indicating that the North Atlantic Group countries would continue to seek ways to resolve the German issue related to European security and agreements on supervised disarmament). This clause was specifically drafted to ease the differences among the member states on the Berlin issue.

　　At last year's North Atlantic Group Council meeting, Britain was prominent due to its establishment as the U.S. agent in Western Europe. It can be seen from this year's annual meeting that as Britain's influence in Western Europe has weakened, its position in the North Atlantic Group has been greatly reduced, and Macmillan's slogan of "interdependence" has completely disappeared from this year's communiqué. During the Paris meeting, the British newspapers were full of complaints and attacked France and West Germany, which was not accidental. An editorial in the "Daily Express" wrote: It would be foolish to think that West Germany "has changed its nature."

　　The Paris meeting did not solve any problems. Spaak has been ordered to travel around the countries to promote U.S. missiles, the "Common Market" dispute will be left for discussion in mid-January next year; de Gaulle's demand for sharing leadership has been shelved, and it will become the root cause of another quarrel between the U.S., Britain, and France.... All these prove that this military group is continuing to move towards fragmentation and disintegration.

    继续走向四分五裂
    本报记者  潘非
    为期三天的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议，在18日灰溜溜地结束了。美英法以及西德之间的对立和斗争，贯穿着巴黎会议的整个进程。
    美国原想通过这次会议，对西欧国家施加压力，迫使它们同意在本国领土上建立美国的火箭基地，并把北大西洋集团的地面部队从二十三个师迅速增加到三十个师。为了冲淡或掩盖这个集团内部日益尖锐的矛盾，美国还打算以拒绝苏联关于柏林问题的建议，来“统一”意志，“团结”内部。
    北大西洋集团军总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德在大会上扮演了重要的角色。他几乎批评了包括英国在内的所有西欧国家，斥责它们没有对“共同防务”尽到应有的责任。会议虽然是秘密的，但人们相信，法国把它的武装部队从西欧调到阿尔及利亚，无疑地成为诺斯塔德指责的主要对象。
    美国没有料到，法国竟然不客气地回敬了一拳。法国提出，要在它的领土上建立火箭基地和储存核弹头，就必须置于法国的控制之下。谁都知道，法国要求分享北大西洋集团领导权的要求，一直受到华盛顿和伦敦的冷遇。巴黎会议为戴高乐提供了迫使美英让步的绝妙机会。“每日快报”透露，戴高乐这一出对台戏，是要迫英美同意：华盛顿和伦敦在决定重大的外交行动之前，应同巴黎协商，并确认法国部队从西欧调到北非，是“保卫北大西洋公约的重要侧翼”。
    在讨论军事问题的时候，分歧不仅出现在美国和法国之间。英国对于估计目前军事需要的方法“表示怀疑”。过去的程序是：各级指挥官提出计划，由设在华盛顿的常设委员会审核。英国要求“在军事机构之上，再作政治的审查。”荷、比、卢表示对于某些“防务”，小国无力负担。英国想通过巴黎会议来打开贸易问题上的僵局（至少是缓和一下气氛）的企图，也完全失败了。劳埃德和戴高乐举行了“九十分钟的冷冰冰的谈判”（“每日快报”），戴高乐只表示他将“怀着好意”来审查英国的建议。
    同美国原来所设想的相反，巴黎会议没有能够掩饰北大西洋集团在柏林问题上的分歧。16日的会议公报，由于辩论公报中的一条条文（表示北大西洋集团各国将继续设法解决同欧洲安全相联系的德国问题以及关于有监督的裁军的协议），使公布时间推迟了两个小时。这一条文原是为了缓和各成员国在柏林问题上的分歧而特意起草的。
    在去年北大西洋集团理事会上，英国由于确立了作为美国在西欧代理人的地位，曾显赫一时。从今年的年会可以看出，随着英国在西欧影响的削弱，它在北大西洋集团中的地位已大大降低，麦克米伦“相互依赖”的口号，在今年的公报中完全消失了。在巴黎会议期间，英国报纸满腹牢骚，对法国和西德大肆攻击，这种情况并不是偶然的。“每日快报”的一篇社论写道：假如认为西德“已改变了本性”，这种看法是愚蠢的。
    巴黎会议没有解决任何问题。斯巴克已奉命周游各国，推销美国火箭，“共同市场”的纠纷将留待明年1月中旬讨论；戴高乐关于分享领导权的要求被搁置下来，它将成为美英法另一次争吵的根源……。所有这些都证明：这个军事集团正在继续走向四分五裂和瓦解。
