Do Not Mechanically Understand the Law of Production Determining Distribution
★ A Few Points for Discussion on the Article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production" ★
Huang Lun
   After reading Comrade Fang Ming's article "Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production," I believe that besides the correct parts, there are some points worth discussing and some obviously wrong views.

   One-sidedly understanding economic laws and neglecting people's ability to understand, control, and apply economic laws is essentially seeing things but not people.
   Comrade Fang Ming insists that distribution must be viewed from production and opposes discussing distribution in isolation, which is undoubtedly correct. Because "any distribution of consumer goods is always merely the consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves. And the distribution of the conditions of production expresses the nature of the mode of production itself." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 2, p. 23) However, I believe that Comrade Fang Ming has understood the law of production determining distribution in a mechanical, one-sided, and mystical way. This is partly because he has not seen the dialectical relationship between production and distribution: "Distribution, however, is not merely a passive result of production and exchange; it influences production and exchange in its turn." ("Anti-Dühring," p. 152) Isn't that so? At the beginning of his article, Comrade Fang Ming emphasized that "the critique of the mode of distribution should mainly adopt the principles of economic laws" and quoted a sentence from Engels. The purpose is to devalue the practical significance of people discussing the issues of the supply system and wage system of distribution. In fact, Engels's statement that "appeals to morality and justice do not help us forward here scientifically; moral indignation, however justifiable, cannot be accepted by economic science as proof, but only as a symptom" tells us that when looking at the collapse and emergence of a certain mode of production, we must use the perspective of historical materialism and tell people not to forcibly do things that objective historical conditions do not allow. Thus, Engels believed that economic science should confirm the root causes of certain economic ills, discover the factors to eliminate the ills, and seek new forms of production, exchange, and distribution. At present, during the profound revolution of production relations caused by the people's commune movement in our country, people are commenting on the ills of the wage system and the advantages of the supply system precisely to eliminate the ills and seek new forms of distribution to suit and promote the development of productive forces. I think this is not only an appeal to morality and justice, but also in line with the dialectical economic law of production and distribution. I think it is not necessarily reasonable to dismiss all articles discussing the merits of the supply system and the wage system as discussing distribution in isolation. In addition, the reason why I say that Comrade Fang Ming has understood economic laws in a one-sided and mystical way is because he has not seen our Party's ability to understand, control, and apply economic laws, that is, he has neglected the great role of people's subjective initiative and putting politics in command. In essence, it is seeing things but not people. It seems that people are powerless in the face of economic laws and can only let them arrange and be enslaved by them. In fact, in our country, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, people have not only begun to become the true masters of nature, but also have become the masters of their own social relations. The laws of social movement are being expertly used by our Party, and the laws are subject to people's control. As Engels said, "Only from then on will men make their own history fully consciously... This is mankind's leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom." ("Anti-Dühring," p. 299) Comrade Fang Ming, however, mystified the laws, only saw the role of economic laws, and forgot the people who expertly use economic laws.

   The military communist supply system has a close internal connection with social production in the Liberated Areas, and it has not only a political basis but also an economic basis.
   Secondly, although Comrade Fang Ming repeatedly emphasized that production determines distribution and emphasized that "distribution is closely related to production, and therefore we cannot talk about the mode of distribution in isolation," the regrettable thing is that Comrade Fang Ming himself violated this principle. Isn't that so? Comrade Fang Ming believes that "the military communist supply system has no specific internal connection with social production," and that the military communist supply system seems to have only a political basis and no economic basis. Therefore, "this kind of equal distribution does not directly affect the development of productive forces, but only guarantees the material supply of the revolutionary ranks." This argument is not only wrong in methodology but also ignores historical facts. In 1933, while still in the Jiangxi Red Area, Chairman Mao criticized in the article "We Must Pay Attention to Economic Work" the error of some people who believed that economic construction could not be carried out in a war environment, pointing out that "only by carrying out work on the economic front and developing the economy of the Red Area can the revolutionary war obtain a considerable material basis..." Therefore, he advocated actively developing agricultural and industrial production. In 1934, Chairman Mao pointed out in the article "Our Economic Policy" that we must carry out all possible and necessary economic construction and concentrate economic forces to supply the war. In 1942, Chairman Mao clearly stipulated in the article "Economic and Financial Problems During the Anti-Japanese War" that "developing the economy and guaranteeing supply is the general policy of our economic and financial work," pointing out that only by developing the economy can we guarantee the supply of this truth. It can be seen that, in history, the military communist supply system relied on fiscal revenue, and finance relied on the economy. The low level of social production, the enemy's strict blockade, and the extreme lack of materials determined that only an equal distribution of the supply system could be implemented among cadres and the army. And the Party's political leadership guaranteed the implementation of this system. It can be seen that the supply system not only has its political basis but also its economic basis, and it has a close internal connection with social production in the Liberated Areas. The people of the Liberated Areas bear the majority of the material supply. It is also incorrect to say that "this kind of equal distribution does not affect the development of social productive forces." Although the supply system was only implemented among cadres and the army at that time and was not implemented among the entire people, the degree of impact on production was not as broad and profound as it is now. However, because the supply system was implemented, the military and civilians shared weal and woe, which played a significant role in improving the relationship between the military and civilians and promoting production development.

   Socialist exchange of equal value is the exchange of one form of labor for another form of labor. The view that individual labor is exchanged with society as a commodity is wrong.
   Third, Comrade Fang Ming believes that "the essence of distribution according to work is to regard labor as a privately owned value, and wages can be spent to exchange labor as remuneration. This is still exchanging individual labor as a commodity with society, and this is the role of the capitalist law of value here." In short, in the socialist system, labor is still a commodity, and the law of value still regulates the value of labor. In this way, the nature of labor in socialist society is no different from that in capitalist society. If this is rationally extended, then surplus value exists in socialist society. This has reached an absurd point. This is obviously a wrong and harmful view. At the same time, it is unscientific to say that "labor" has "value."

   Labor becoming a commodity is an inevitable phenomenon of capitalist production relations. Because in capitalist society, the means of production are separated from labor: capitalists occupy the means of production, and the proletariat has nothing but labor, so they have to sell labor as a commodity to capitalists for use. Workers and capitalists superficially carry out an exchange of equal value based on the principle of equality in the labor market, but in fact, it is an unequal exchange—the capitalist exploits the surplus value created by the workers. The wage form conceals this exploitative relationship. In capitalist society, the value of labor is formed by the value of the means of subsistence necessary to maintain the reproduction of the laborer and his species, so the law of value regulates the value of labor.

   In socialist society, the means of production are combined with labor. The public ownership of the means of production determines the fundamental change in the nature of labor. People no longer work for capitalists, are no longer exploited, and people's labor is for themselves and for society. Labor is no longer a commodity because laborers cannot sell labor to themselves or the society of laborers. "Labor is a commodity" is a historical category of capitalist production relations and is fundamentally incompatible with socialist production relations.

   Opposed to the capitalist principle of labor as a commodity is the socialist principle of "distribution according to work." The essence of "distribution according to work" is that society does not recognize any class differences, but it defaults to unequal individual talents and treats unequal labor with this equal principle of labor as a measure in the distribution of means of subsistence. Treating inequality with an equal measure is actually inequality. Only in this sense did Marx believe that this equal right is still a bourgeois right. Since the principle of equal exchange prevails here, does that mean that "individual labor is exchanged with society as a commodity"? Of course, we cannot say that. Because the so-called "exchange of equal value" here is carried out on the basis of the public ownership of the means of production, and the principle of distribution of the means of production is no longer contradictory to the principle of distribution of the means of subsistence. There is no relationship of exploitation and being exploited here. Laborers exchange a certain quantity of labor in one form for the same quantity of labor in another form, and socialist society is the witness or regulator of this exchange of equal value. The personal interests of laborers are consistent with the interests of society, and there is no relationship of buying and selling labor between them. However, socialist society still preserves commodity production, and the exchange of people's labor is realized through commodities, but it is by no means equivalent to labor itself being a commodity.

   不要机械地理解生产决定分配的规律
   ★对“必须从生产看分配”一文的几点商榷★
   黄伦
   读了方名同志的“必须从生产看分配”一文，我认为除了正确的部分，还有一些值得商榷的地方，和显然错误的观点。
    片面地理解经济规律，忽视了人对经济规律的认识、控制和运用的能力，实质上是见物不见人
    方名同志坚持必须从生产看分配，反对就分配谈分配，这无疑是正确的。因为“消费品的任何一种分配，始终只不过是生产条件本身分配的后果。而生产条件的分配，则表现生产方式本身的性质。”（马恩文选两卷集第二卷二十三页）但我认为方名同志把生产决定分配的规律作了机械的、片面的、神化的理解。这一方面是因为没有看到生产与分配之间的辩证关系：“分配并不是生产和交换的单纯消极的结果；分配反过来又影响生产和交换。”（“反杜林论”一百五十二页）不是吗：方名同志在文章一开头就强调“对于分配方式的批判，主要要采用经济规律的原则”，并引用了恩格斯的一句话，其目的是为了贬低人们讨论供给制和工资制分配问题的实际意义。其实，恩格斯所说“对于道德和正义的申诉，在科学上并没有丝毫令我们前进，无论道德上的义愤如何入情入理，经济科学总不能把它看作是证据，而只能看作是象征”这句话，是告诉我们看待某种生产方式的崩溃与产生，必须用历史唯物主义的眼光，告诉人们不能勉强去做客观历史条件不允许的事情。从而恩格斯认为经济科学应确证某种经济弊病产生的根源，发现消除弊病的因素，寻找新的生产、交换和分配的形式。当前我国由于人民公社化运动所引起的生产关系又一次深刻革命的时候，人们评论工资制的弊病，供给制的好处，正是为了消除弊病，寻求新的分配形式，使之适合并推动生产力的发展。我以为这不但是道德的和正义的申诉，而且符合生产与分配的辩证经济规律。把谈论供给制、工资制优劣的文章统统贬之为就分配谈分配，我想也未必入情入理。此外，我之所以说方名同志把经济规律作了片面的、神化的理解，是因为他没有看到我们党对经济规律的认识、控制和运用能力，即忽视了人们的主观能动性和政治挂帅的伟大作用。实质上是见物不见人。似乎人们在经济规律面前无能为力，只好听任安排，受其奴役。其实，在我国，由于党的正确领导和以马克思列宁主义作为指南，人们不但已开始成为自然界的真正主人，而且已成为自己的社会关系的主人。社会运动的规律被我们党十分内行地运用着，规律服从于人们的支配了。正如恩格斯所说“只有从这时起，人们才开始充分自觉地自己创造自己的历史”……这是人类从必然的王国进于自由的王国的飞跃。”（“反杜林论”二百九十九页）方名同志却把规律神化，只看到经济规律的作用，而忘记了内行地运用经济规律的人。
    军事共产主义供给制，与解放区社会生产有密切的内部联系，不但有其政治基础，而且有其经济基础
    其次，方名同志虽然一再强调生产决定分配，强调“分配和生产有着密切联系，因而不可悬空地就分配方式谈分配方式。”然而遗憾的是：不是别人正是方名同志自己违背这个法则。不是吗？方名同志认为“军事共产主义的供给制和社会生产没有特定的内部联系”，军事共产主义的供给制似乎只有政治基础，没有经济基础，因而，这种平等分配并不直接影响生产力的发展，只是保证革命队伍的物质供给。”这种论断不仅在方法论上是错误的，而且是无视历史事实的。1933年，还在江西红色区域时，毛主席就在“必须注意经济工作”一文中批评了有些人认为在战争环境不能进行经济建设的错误，指出“只有开展经济战线方面的工作，发展红色区域的经济，才能使革命战争得到相当的物质基础……。”因而主张积极发展农业、工业生产。1934年，毛主席在“我们的经济政策”一文中又指出，要进行一切可能的和必要的经济建设，集中经济力量供给战争。1942年毛主席在“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”一文中明确规定：“发展经济，保证供给，是我们的经济工作和财政工作的总方针。”指出只有发展经济才能保证供给这一真理。可见，在历史上，军事共产主义的供给制有赖于财政收入，而财政又依赖于经济。社会生产水平低下，敌人严密封锁，物质十分缺乏，这就决定了在干部和军队中只能实行平等分配的供给制。而党的政治领导又保证了这种制度的实行。可见供给制不但有其政治基础，而且有其经济基础，并且是与解放区社会生产有着密切的内部联系，解放区人民负担着大部分物质供应。说“这种平等分配并不影响社会生产力的发展”也是不正确的。虽然当时供给制只在干部和军队中实行，并未在全民中实行，影响生产的程度不像现在这样广泛深刻。但由于实行供给制军民同甘共苦，对改善军民关系，促进生产发展起了重大作用。
    社会主义的等价交换，是以一种形态的劳动与另一种形态的劳动相交换，认为个人劳动是作为商品向社会交换的观点是错误的
    第三，方名同志认为“按劳取酬的本质是把劳动当成私人占有的价值，可以支出劳动换取工资作为酬劳。这还是把个人劳动作为商品向社会进行交换，这就是资本主义的价值法则在这儿起作用。”简言之，在社会主义制度下，劳动力仍然是商品，价值规律还在调节劳动力价值。如此看来，社会主义社会的劳动同资本主义社会的劳动在性质上毫无区别了。如此合理引伸下去，社会主义社会就存在剩余价值了。这就到了荒谬的地步。这显然是错误的有害的观点，同时，说“劳动”有“价值”也是不科学的。
    劳动力成为商品，是资本主义生产关系的必然现象。因为在资本主义社会，生产资料是和劳动力分离的：资本家占有生产资料，无产者除了劳动力一无所有，只好把劳动力当作商品出卖给资本家使用。工人同资本家在劳动市场上表面上进行着平等原则的等价交换，其实是不等价交换——资本家剥削工人创造的剩余价值。工资形式掩盖了这种剥削关系。在资本主义社会，劳动力价值是由维持劳动者及其种属的再生产所必需的生活资料的价值形成，因而价值规律就调节着劳动力价值。
    在社会主义社会，生产资料是和劳动力结合着的。生产资料的公有制决定了劳动性质的根本改变，人们不再为资本家劳动，不再受剥削，人们的劳动是为自己也是为社会。劳动力不再是商品，因为劳动者不能向劳动者自己或劳动者的社会出卖劳动力。“劳动力是商品”是资本主义生产关系的历史范畴，与社会主义生产关系根本不相容。
    与劳动力当作商品的资本主义原则相对立的，是社会主义性质的“按劳取酬”原则。“按劳取酬”的本质是：社会不承认任何阶级差别，但默认不同等的个人天赋，在生活资料的分配上，以劳动为尺度这个平等原则对待不等的劳动。以平等的尺度对待不平等，实际上是不平等。只有在这个意义上，马克思才认为这种平等的权利仍然是资产阶级式的法权。既然这里通行着等价交换原则，那末是否就是把“个人劳动作为商品向社会进行交换”呢？当然不能这样说。因为这里的所谓“等价交换”是在生产资料公有制基础上进行的，生产资料的分配原则与生活资料的分配原则已不相矛盾。这里不存在剥削与被剥削的关系。劳动者以一种形态的一定数量的劳动与另一种形态的同量劳动相交换，社会主义社会就是这种等价交换的见证人或调节者。劳动者的个人利益与社会利益是一致的，他们之间不是买卖劳动力的关系。但社会主义社会还保存商品生产，人们的劳动交换是通过商品实现的，但绝不等于劳动力本身就是商品。
