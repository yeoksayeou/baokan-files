Rectifying Ideological Style, Strengthening the Leadership Core
Gansu Provincial Party Committee Inspection Team Gains Experience in Helping Communes Rectify

(Our dispatch) The Zhangye Sub-Team of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee's Inspection and Evaluation Team, by adopting the method of delving into key areas and discussing the abstract based on the concrete, helped the Liangjiadun People's Commune in Zhangye County to rectify the commune Party committee's leadership ideology, and explored the key to rectifying the commune well.

After arriving at the commune on the 13th, the inspection team, together with cadres from Zhangye County, the commune Party committee secretary, and cadres from production teams, as well as model figures among the commune members, went to the front lines in groups. Starting with promoting current production, doing a good job in income distribution, and caring for the welfare of the commune members, they linked it with ideological realities and inspected the commune's production, life, and work. The inspection team believed that the Liangjiadun People's Commune, in the two months since its establishment, had been leading all commune members in working hard and skillfully, and had achieved great results in steel and agricultural production and construction, demonstrating the great superiority of the people's commune. For example, all of the commune's more than 112,000 mu of cultivated land for next year has been deeply plowed, generally meeting the standards; field canals have been repaired, and eight reservoirs and five storage ponds are currently under construction; combining water conservancy construction and fertilization, field wooden railcar tracks have also been built, increasing transportation efficiency by two to three times compared to large carts. In terms of the commune's welfare undertakings, work in public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, etc., has been greatly improved compared to before. However, because the commune Party committee is not yet sound and the leadership core has not yet fully formed, some cadres have neglected democratic management and have somewhat fostered simple and hasty administrative commandism and privileged thinking in the process of realizing organizational militarization, action combatization, and collective living; they lack due care for the lives of the masses; their leadership work is also not deep enough, and some Party committee members are satisfied with the existing achievements and are complacent. The commune Party committee has not promptly carried out ideological criticism of these erroneous ideological styles.

The inspection team believes that this commune was established not long ago and has been busy with steel, autumn harvest, and other production and construction work. The commune Party committee also has no experience in running the commune to draw on and has had to explore and advance in practice. Therefore, it is inevitable that some problems exist. These are shortcomings in the process of advancement. However, they must be actively overcome. The inspection team immediately convened a forum attended by commune cadres and some commune members. Adopting the method of discussing the abstract based on the concrete, it mobilized the commune Party committee members, management area, and production team cadres to launch an in-depth mass rectification movement, with socialist and communist ideological education as the guiding principle, with production as the center, and with rectifying the leadership ideology of the commune Party committee as the main content. First, rectify the leadership ideology of the commune Party committee. Break with conservative thinking and establish leap-forward thinking; break with "habitualism" and establish the theory of continuous revolution; break with administrative commandism and establish the mass line style; break with decentralism and establish the overall concept; break with the privileged thinking of being superior to others and establish the communist ideological of appearing as an ordinary laborer; break with the superficial work style and establish the work style of participating in production and leading production, in order to establish and strengthen the strong leadership core of the commune Party committee, implement the principle of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and the production policy of simultaneously developing self-sufficiency production and commodity production, summarize the experiences and lessons of 1958, establish and improve the commune management system, formulate the 1959 production plan, launch a winter production upsurge, prepare well for next year's production, and do a good job in managing the lives of the masses. At present, the rectification work of the Liangjiadun People's Commune is underway.

    整顿思想作风  健全领导核心
    甘肃省委检查团帮助整社取得经验
    本报讯  中共甘肃省委检查评比总团张掖分团，采取深入重点，就实论虚的方法，在张掖县梁家墩人民公社帮助公社党委整顿领导思想，摸索出整顿好公社的关键。
    检查团13日到达公社后，就同张掖县的干部、公社党委书记和生产队的干部，以及社员中的模范人物，分组深入现场，从推动当前生产、做好收入分配、关心社员福利生活入手，联系思想实际，检查了公社的生产、生活和工作。检查团认为，梁家墩人民公社在建社两个多月的时间内，领导全体社员大干巧干，在钢铁和农业生产建设等方面，都取得了很大的成绩，显示了人民公社的巨大优越性。例如，全社明年十一万二千多亩耕地，已经全部深翻，一般合乎标准；整修了田间渠道，目前正在兴修八个水库和五个蓄水池；结合兴修水利和施肥，还修建了田间木轨车车道，运输效率比用大车提高两三倍。在公社福利事业方面，公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所等工作，都较前有很大的改进。但是由于公社党委还不够健全，领导核心还没有完全形成，部分干部在实现组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的过程中，忽视了管理民主化，简单急躁的行政命令作风和特权思想有所滋长；对群众的生活缺乏应有的关怀；领导工作也不够深入，有的党委成员满足于现有成绩，骄傲自满。对于这些错误的思想作风，公社党委没有及时开展思想批判。
    检查团认为这个公社搭起架子为时不久，又忙于钢铁、秋收等生产建设工作，公社党委也没办社的经验可资借鉴，而不得不在实践中摸索前进。因而存在一些问题是难免的。这是前进过程中的缺点。但是必须积极克服。检查团即召集了公社干部和部分社员参加的座谈会，采取了就实论虚的方法，发动公社党委委员、管理区和生产队的干部，以社会主义和共产主义思想教育为纲，以生产为中心，以整顿公社党委的领导思想为主要内容，深入开展群众性的整风运动。首先整顿好公社党委的领导思想。破保守思想，立跃进思想；破“习惯论”，立不断革命论；破行政命令作风，立群众路线作风；破分散主义，立整体观念；破高人一等的特权思想，立以普通劳动者姿态出现的共产主义思想；破浮而不深的工作作风，立参加生产、领导生产的工作作风，以建立和加强公社党委坚强的领导核心，贯彻执行人民公社工业和农业同时并举的方针、自给生产和商品生产同时并举的生产方针，总结1958年的经验教训，建立和健全公社管理制度，制定1959年的生产规划，掀起冬季生产高潮，做好明年的生产准备工作，做好对群众生活的管理工作。现在，梁家墩人民公社的整社工作正在进行。
