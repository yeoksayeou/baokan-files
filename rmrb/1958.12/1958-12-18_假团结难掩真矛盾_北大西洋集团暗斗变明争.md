Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting discussed the so-called "political consultation" issue on the afternoon of the 16th. Secretary-General Spaak called on the participating countries to strengthen "cooperation" during the meeting. However, the discussion process was like a bursting boil, instantly exposing the life-and-death contradictions within NATO. This overshadowed the "unity" on the Berlin issue that the American spokesperson had been trying so hard to tout.

The meeting was held in secret. According to the meeting spokesperson, Spaak first delivered a report on the issue of "political consultation."

Spaak said that since the Council meeting in September of last year, NATO has been conducting "intense political consultations" on the international situation. He believed that the "consultations" among NATO countries were "successful" in responding to the Soviet Union's proposal for a summit conference. But he then said that "consultations" were "less successful" regarding the landing of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan, and on the "Quemoy issue." Spaak avoided explaining this point, fearing that he would touch NATO's scars.

Spaak argued that "consultations" among NATO member states should not be limited to discussing issues within NATO's geographical scope. He called on member states to "consult with each other to formulate common views before taking specific positions on certain issues." Prior to this, the United States' actions in the Taiwan Strait area and the US-British intervention in Lebanon and Jordan were criticized by some countries in the group as actions lacking consultation.

Spaak finally suggested establishing a committee composed of senior officials to "pay greater attention to the preparation for political consultations."

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also spoke about strengthening "political consultation." He stated that "the United States is fully willing to submit any of its policies for discussion by the NATO Council and is willing to consider any opinions our NATO partners may have on these policies." It is said that Dulles issued this blank check to ease the serious dissatisfaction of other member states, especially France, with the US and Britain's monopoly of leadership in NATO. During his meeting with French Prime Minister de Gaulle on the 15th, de Gaulle clearly demanded the establishment of a "leadership core" of the United States, Britain, and France, so that France could have a greater voice in the Western world. However, de Gaulle's request has been rejected.

Foreign ministers (or ministers) from West Germany, Denmark, Norway, Greece, and Turkey, among others, emphasized in their speeches the seriousness of the conflict between the six countries of the European "Common Market" led by West Germany and France, and the other members of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization" led by Britain, which advocate the establishment of a "free trade zone." They expressed great concern about this situation and said in one way or another: "If Western Europe is economically divided, it will be difficult to maintain a military alliance."

The Icelandic representative issued a statement on the fishing range issue, saying that his government felt "regret" over the "tense situation" between Britain and Iceland. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd immediately replied that if Iceland's claims were based on law, then "let's go to the International Court of Justice."

Greek Foreign Minister Averoff said: "I know you want to raise the Cyprus issue (at the meeting), but I am not prepared to do so." News said that Averoff's words showed Greece's wariness of this group organization hijacked by the United States, and also indicated that he had lost confidence in this group organization "mediating" the Cyprus issue.

The meeting adopted Spaak's report, but did not reach any agreement on any substantive issues that caused controversy.

The meeting then discussed the Berlin issue again and drafted a communique on the issue. It is said that Dulles gave another lengthy speech, once again clamoring that the West must be "absolutely firm" on the Berlin issue.

On this day, the NATO Secretariat submitted a so-called "situation document" on Africa to the meeting. This document expressed alarm at the West's rapidly losing control over Africa. Under the guise of the Soviet Union "infiltrating Africa," the document maliciously attacked the United Arab Republic and the Pan-African People's Conference that had just closed in Accra, and opposed African countries "moving towards neutralism and nationalism." It advocated that member states act in unison to deal with the burgeoning national independence movement in Africa.

### 假团结难掩真矛盾  北大西洋集团暗斗变明争

    假团结难掩真矛盾
    北大西洋集团暗斗变明争
    新华社17日讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋公约组织理事会会议16日下午讨论所谓“政治协商”问题，秘书长斯巴克在会上呼吁与会各国加强“合作”，但是讨论过程却像爆破的脓疮，一下子就把北大西洋公约组织内部你死我活的矛盾暴露了出来，这使美国发言人竭力吹嘘的所谓会议在柏林问题上的“团结”黯然失色。
    会议是秘密举行的。据会议发言人说，斯巴克首先作了关于“政治协商”问题的报告。
    斯巴克说，自从去年9月的理事会会议以来，北大西洋公约组织对国际形势一直进行“紧张的政治协商”。他认为，在对苏联关于最高级会议的建议的答复方面，北大西洋集团各国的“协商”是“成功”的。但是他接着说，在美、英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆以及在“金门问题”上，“协商”就“不那么成功了”。斯巴克对于这一点避免加以解释，因为他深怕触痛北大西洋公约组织的伤疤。
    斯巴克主张北大西洋公约组织成员国的“协商”不要限于讨论北大西洋公约组织地理区域范围的问题，他呼吁各成员国“在对一些问题采取具体的立场以前，先进行磋商来拟订共同的观点”。在这以前，美国在台湾海峡地区的行动以及美英在黎巴嫩、约旦的干涉被这个集团的一些国家指责为缺乏商量的行动。
    斯巴克最后建议成立由高级官员组成的委员会，以便对“政治协商的准备工作给予更大的注意”。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯也谈到了要加强“政治协商”的问题。他表示，“美国完全愿意把它的任何政策都提交北大西洋公约组织理事会讨论，并且愿意考虑我们的北大西洋公约组织伙伴们对这些政策提出的任何意见。”据说，杜勒斯所以开出这张空头支票，目的是想缓和一下其他成员国，特别是法国对美、英两国垄断北大西洋公约组织领导权的严重不满。杜勒斯15日在同法国总理戴高乐会谈时，戴高乐就明白要求建立美、英、法三国的“领导核心”，以便法国在西方世界享有更大的发言权。但是戴高乐这个要求已遭到拒绝。
    西德、丹麦、挪威、希腊和土耳其等国外交部长（大臣）在发言时着重指出了以西德、法国为首的欧洲“共同市场”六国一方和以英国为首的主张建立“自由贸易区”的“欧洲经济合作局”其他成员国为一方的冲突的严重性。他们对这一局面表示十分忧虑，并且以这一种或那一种方式说：“如果西欧在经济上陷于分裂，那就很难保持军事联盟”。
    冰岛代表就捕鱼范围问题发表声明说，他的政府对英国和冰岛之间的“紧张局面”感到“遗憾”。英国外交大臣劳埃德马上回答说，如果冰岛的要求是以法律为基础的，那么“让我们告到国际法庭”。
    希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫说：“我知道你们想（在会议上）提出塞浦路斯问题，但是我不准备这样做”。消息说，阿维罗夫的这些话显示了希腊对这个美国挟持的集团组织的戒心，也表示他对于由这一个集团组织“调解”塞浦路斯问题丧失了信心。
    会议通过了斯巴克的报告，但是没有就引起争论的任何实质问题达成什么协议。
    会议接着再次讨论柏林问题，拟定关于这个问题的公报。据说，杜勒斯又发表冗长讲话，再一次叫嚷西方在柏林问题上要“绝对坚定”。
    这一天，北大西洋公约组织秘书处向会议提出了一个关于非洲的所谓“形势文件”，这个文件对西方迅速失去对非洲的控制表示惊慌。文件在苏联“渗入非洲”的幌子下，恶意攻击阿拉伯联合共和国和刚刚在阿克拉闭幕的全非人民大会，反对非洲国家“走向中立主义和民族主义”。鼓吹各会员国一致行动，来对付非洲蓬勃兴起的民族独立运动。
