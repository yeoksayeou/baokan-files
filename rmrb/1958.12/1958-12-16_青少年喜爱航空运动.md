Since organized activities began in a dozen cities in 1954, there has been considerable development in just four years, with activities now taking place in over one hundred cities across the country. Aviation model activities have gradually become organized and led mass activities. Due to the widespread development of the sport, the technical level of aviation models has improved rapidly. The results of the 1958 National Aviation Model Zonal Competition were very good, with the total score of the champion Hebei team reaching 2,626 points, only 74 points away from the highest score of 2,700 points; the total score of sixteen teams in the competition was above 2,000 points, while only six teams reached 2,000 points last year. In addition, Chinese aviation model athletes have also achieved good results in international aviation model competitions.

    In recent years, skydiving has gradually become popular among the masses. A large number of teenagers regularly participate in this activity.

    Gliding has established a foundation in our country. This activity has been launched in eighteen cities across the country. Many young students and workers use their vacations to participate in gliding activities at aviation clubs, learning the principles of flight and the knowledge possessed by pilots, such as the structure of airplanes and gliders. Some glider athletes have achieved excellent results after a short period of training. In terms of glider manufacturing, our country can now manufacture primary, intermediate, and advanced gliders.

    青少年喜爱航空运动
    随着整个体育事业的发展，我国航空运动也日益为广大青少年所喜爱，参加各项活动的人越来越多。各项活动的技术水平也有显著提高，并取得了好的成绩。
    航空模型活动是目前在航空运动中开展得最普遍的一个项目。自1954年开始在十几个城市有组织地开展活动以来到现在，短短的四年间已有相当的发展，在全国一百几十个城市中开展了这项运动。航模活动已逐步成为有组织有领导的群众性的活动。由于运动的广泛开展，航模的技术水平迅速提高。1958年全国航空模型分区竞赛成绩很好，冠军河北队的总分达到二千六百二十六分，同最高分数二千七百分仅差七十四分；竞赛中有十六个代表队的总分在二千分以上，而去年只有六个队的总分达到二千分。另外，在国际航模竞赛中，我国航模运动员也获得好的成绩。
    跳伞运动几年来，已逐渐普及到群众中去。广大青少年经常参加这项活动。
    滑翔运动在我国已建立下基础。全国十八个城市已开展这项活动。很多青年学生、工人利用假期到航空俱乐部参加滑翔运动，学习飞行原理以及飞机和滑翔机的构造等飞行员所具备的知识。有些滑翔运动员，经过短期的训练就创造出优良的成绩。在滑翔机制造方面，我国现在初、中、高级滑翔机都能制造。
    另外，飞机飞行和航空工程两个项目活动，也在逐步发展中。
