Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 7th: At a time when the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is experiencing an unprecedented bumper harvest of autumn rice, the China State Farm Exhibition opened in Hanoi today.

This is the first agricultural exhibition held by China abroad at the invitation of a foreign country. It has received great attention and care from the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, the army, and people from all walks of life.

Attending today's opening ceremony were Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Deputy Premiers Truong Chinh, Phan Ke Toai, and Vo Nguyen Giap, ministers and vice-ministers of various government departments, senior generals of the People's Army, leaders of various people's organizations, diplomatic envoys of various countries to Vietnam, and representatives of people from all walks of life.

He Wei, the Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, also attended the opening ceremony.

Amidst warm applause, Premier Pham Van Dong cut the ribbon for the exhibition. Accompanied by Deputy Premier Truong Chinh and others, and in the company of Zhang Zhonghan, head of the exhibition delegation and Vice Minister of the Chinese Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, and Ambassador He Wei, he carefully visited all parts of the exhibition hall.

The exhibition hall is mainly divided into three parts: the State-owned Farms Pavilion, the Military Reclamation Farms Pavilion, and the Agricultural Cooperatives and People's Communes Pavilion. The exhibits include large-scale photographs, charts, various physical objects, and models, introducing the experiences and lessons China has gained in the process of developing agricultural production to Vietnamese viewers.

The main purpose of this exhibition is to reflect how Chinese agriculture has been transformed and developed; at the same time, it aims to learn from the valuable experience of the Vietnamese people in agriculture during the exhibition process.

In his speech at the opening ceremony, Vice Minister Zhang Zhonghan expressed his gratitude to the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, and the people of Hanoi for their kind concern and assistance to the exhibition delegation. He expressed the Chinese people's joy and congratulations on the great development of agricultural cooperatives in Vietnam and the unprecedented bumper harvest this autumn.

Zhang Zhonghan said: "In the land of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, many military reclamation farms have been established in just one year, and tens of thousands of armed forces have been put into production and construction. This action demonstrates the peace-loving intentions of socialist countries and also demonstrates the consistent noble qualities of the Vietnamese People's Army in the cause of liberating, defending, and building the motherland.”

Vietnamese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Nghiem Xuan Yem said in his speech that China's great achievements on the production front undoubtedly prove the superiority of the socialist system and the peace-loving will of the people of socialist countries. He thanked the exhibition delegation for bringing valuable gifts from afar and thanked the Chinese Communist Party and the government for the assistance provided in this exhibition.

    范文同总理到会剪彩并参观
    据新华社河内7日电  在越南民主共和国秋稻获得空前大丰收的时候，中国农垦展览会今天在河内开幕。
    这是中国第一次应邀在国外举行的农业方面的展览会。它受到越南劳动党、政府、军队和各界人民的极大重视和关怀。
    参加今天举行的开幕典礼的，有越南民主共和国总理范文同，副总理长征、潘继遂、武元甲，政府各部正副部长，人民军的高级将领以及各人民团体的负责人、各国驻越南的外交使节和各界人民代表等。
    中国驻越南大使何伟也出席了开幕仪式。
    范文同总理在热烈的掌声中为展览会剪彩，并且同长征副总理等一起，在展览团团长、中国农垦部副部长张仲瀚和何伟大使的陪同下，详细参观了展览馆的各个部分。
    展览馆主要分国营农场馆、军垦农场馆和农业合作社及人民公社馆等三大部分。展览品包括巨幅图片、图表、各种实物和模型，向越南观众们介绍了中国在发展农业生产过程中取得的经验和教训。
    举办这次展览会的主要目的，在于反映中国农业是通过什么样的道路进行改造和发展起来的；同时要在展出过程中向越南人民吸取农业方面的宝贵经验。
    张仲瀚副部长在开幕仪式的讲话中，对越南劳动党中央、政府和河内人民给予展览团的亲切关怀和帮助表示感谢。他表达了中国人民对越南农业合作社大发展和今秋空前大丰收的喜悦和祝贺。
    张仲瀚说：“在越南民主共和国的土地上，仅仅在一年的时间内，就建成了许多军垦农场，成万的武装部队投入了生产建设。这一行动，表现了社会主义国家酷爱和平的意愿，也表明了越南人民军在解放祖国、保卫祖国和建设祖国的事业中一贯的高贵品质。
    越南农林部部长严春庵在讲话中说，中国在生产战线上的伟大成就无可辩驳地证明了社会主义制度的优越性以及社会主义国家人民的和平意志。他感谢展览团不远千里带来珍贵的礼物，感谢中国共产党和政府在这次展览中所提供的帮助。
