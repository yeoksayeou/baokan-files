    Our Discussion Should Also Be Realistic and Theoretical
    – Two Points of Opinion on Comrade Huang Lun’s Article
    Zhan Biao
    Comrade Huang Lun raised three different opinions regarding Comrade Fang Ming’s article “Distribution Must Be Viewed from Production.”
    His accusations against Comrade Fang Ming in points one and two are not only unfair but also expose his own incorrect viewpoints. He said that Comrade Fang Ming emphasized the economic law of production determining distribution and quoted Engels’s words “with the aim of belittling the practical significance of people discussing the supply system and wage system distribution issues.” This is unfounded. What Comrade Fang Ming pointed out in his article – that there was more talk of distribution from the perspective of distribution itself, and more appeals to reason and justice than scientific economic analysis – is indeed the case. Pointing these out does not mean belittling the practical significance of discussing distribution issues. In fact, pointing these out is helpful to solving the problems in the discussion. Separated from the principle of production determining distribution, the question of the merits of the so-called supply system versus the wage system cannot be resolved. The problem lies in the fact that Comrade Huang Lun’s understanding of this fundamental Marxist principle of production determining distribution is one-sided and incorrect.
    He criticized Comrade Fang Ming’s assertion that "the supply system of military communism has no specific internal connection with social production" as "not only wrong in methodology but also disregarding historical facts." What does he consider to be the "close internal connection" between the military communist supply system and the social production of the liberated areas? He says it is that "the people of the liberated areas bore most of the material supply." This is Huang Lun's understanding of the economic foundation of the military communist supply system. Comrade Huang Lun here is truly "seeing things but not people." He understands the economic base as material production without specific economic relations. It should be said that this is a bourgeois viewpoint. The economic base as we understand it is the unity of productive forces and production relations. Only the bourgeoisie would abstract specific production relations to conceal their class exploitation, for example, by calling capital the means of production, saying that it is an indispensable part of material production, so that capital will exist forever.
    Comrade Huang Lun, like Pu Huandong, only knows the production of material means, but does not know the production of people's production relations. The social production in the liberated areas supplied the army and cadres with provisions. But under what kind of production relations were these provisions produced? Supplying materials does not mean that this production has a close internal connection with the supply of military communism.
    It should be pointed out that such phenomena of confusing the material relations of social production with economic relations are now not uncommon. This is a kind of "failure to distinguish between the real and the illusory." For example, some people now confuse distribution according to labor with the piece-rate wage system, which is also a kind of "failure to distinguish between the real and the illusory." They believe that "remuneration according to labor" means calculating remuneration according to individual concrete labor. Everyone knows that wages are the embodiment of social labor, and the relationship between individual concrete labor and social labor should be clarified.
    Marx said: "Crude empiricism, when faced with theoretical contradictions it cannot solve, will degenerate into erroneous metaphysics and scholasticism. Everything is derived from simple formal abstractions, from general laws to various undeniable empirical phenomena." Now, some articles that discuss the dual nature of distribution according to labor, they also "derive various undeniable empirical phenomena from simple formal abstractions." Although they have not truly studied what distribution according to labor is, what labor is distributed according to, and what determines this principle? They can talk at length about the contradictory development of the positive and negative aspects of "remuneration according to labor" based on general dialectical principles. Comrade Huang Lun’s article is like this. As soon as he sees someone proposing the economic law of production determining distribution, he will call it mechanism and fatalism, saying that he does not understand the dialectical relationship between production and distribution. In fact, it is he himself who has made a "simple formal abstraction" of this principle.
    Secondly, what is more problematic is: why is it that emphasizing the economic law of production determining distribution would be "seeing things but not people"? Can't people's subjective initiative and political command, as well as the understanding and utilization of economic laws, proceed from production? Can't they be based on economic laws? Can one emphasize people's subjective initiative by separating it from objective regularity?
    Any individual as we understand it is the personification of specific production relations. To truly understand the "people" under the socialist system, we must scientifically analyze socialist production and socialist labor. I have already said that socialist labor is a kind of labor with a self-conscious social necessary labor nature. This is an inevitable manifestation of social labor under the conditions of socialist ownership and the existence of the old social division of labor. "Seeing things but not people" means not recognizing the nature of this labor, not seeing that "a great socialist enthusiasm is hidden in the masses" (Chairman Mao) is because they only see the entity of this labor (for example, yesterday’s peasants who did not have tractors and still used manual tools.) but cannot see the social nature of this labor. This is "not distinguishing between the real and the illusory."
    Therefore, it is not wrong to regard people's subjective initiative as a reflection of this labor. But saying that it is "practically boundless" shows that one does not understand this labor either. In fact, the productivity of this labor is indeed incomparably higher than that of wage labor and small private ownership, but it is also limited. In fact, even in the advanced stage of communism, one cannot emphasize people's subjective initiative by separating it from objective regularity. In the present, separating oneself from socialist labor and abstractly emphasizing people's subjective initiative runs the risk of falling into idealism.
    To truly understand socialist labor, one must adhere to proceeding from production, and discover objective economic laws from a scientific and concrete analysis of economic conditions. For example, to understand distribution according to labor, one must specifically analyze the socialist labor form manifested in socialist production and exchange. Only after understanding the nature of this labor can one truly understand this principle. Instead of regarding economic laws as mechanism and fatalism as soon as one hears them; and regarding scientific economic analysis as being detached from reality as soon as one hears it. One must know that leaving scientific abstraction, like Comrade Huang Lun’s understanding of the principle of production determining distribution, will lead to the "simple formal abstraction" of the bourgeois viewpoint. Therefore, I believe that "focusing on theory" in discussing this issue is helpful to solving the problem.

### 我们的讨论也要就实论虚——对黄伦同志的文章提出两点意见

    我们的讨论也要就实论虚
    ——对黄伦同志的文章提出两点意见
    詹彪
    黄伦同志对方名同志“必须从生产看分配”一文提出三点不同意见。
    他在一、二点中对方名同志的指责，不仅是不公正的，并且也暴露了他自己的不正确观点。他说方名同志强调生产决定分配的经济规律并引用恩格斯一句话“其目的是为了贬低人们讨论供给制和工资制分配问题的实际意义”。这是没有根据的。方名同志文中所指出的就分配谈分配、道理和正义的申诉多于科学的经济分析，确实是存在的。指出这些并不就是贬低讨论分配问题的实际意义。事实上指出这些，对解决讨论中的问题是有帮助的。离开了生产决定分配的原则，所谓供给制与工资制的优劣问题是不能解决的。问题是在于黄伦同志对马克思主义这个生产决定分配的根本原则的认识是片面的、不正确的。
    他批评方名同志“军事共产主义的供给制和社会生产没有特定的内部联系”的论断为“不仅在方法论上是错误的，而且是无视历史事实的”。他认为军事共产主义供给制和解放区社会生产的“密切的内部联系”是什么呢？他说是“解放区人民负担着大部分物质供应”。这就是黄伦所理解的军事共产主义供给制的经济基础。黄伦同志在这里真正是“见物不见人”了。他把经济基础理解为没有特定的经济关系的物质生产。应该说这是一种资产阶级观点。我们所理解的经济基础是生产力和生产关系的统一体。只有资产阶级才会把特定的生产关系抽象而掩盖其阶级剥削，比如把资本说成是生产资料，说成是物质生产中不可缺少的部分，从而使资本永远存在。
    黄伦同志也像蒲奂东一样，只知道物质资料的生产，而不知道人们生产关系的生产。解放区社会生产是供给了军队和干部的给养。但这种给养是在什么样的生产关系下生产出来的呢？供应了物资，并不等于说这种生产与军事共产主义的供给有密切的内部联系。
    应该指出像这样把社会生产的物质关系与经济关系混为一谈的现象现在是并不少见的。这是一种“虚实不辨”。如现在有些人把按劳分配和计件工资制混为一谈，也就是一种“虚实不辨”。他们认为“按劳取酬”就是按照个人具体劳动计算报酬。大家知道工资是社会劳动的体现，个人具体劳动与社会间劳动的关系是应该弄清楚的。
    马克思说：“粗率的经验主义在碰到它不能解决的理论矛盾时，都会激变为谬误的形而上学、经院主义了。都只由单纯的形式的抽象，从一般法则演出各种不可否认的经验的现象。”现在有些谈论按劳分配的两重性的文章，它们也“都只由单纯的形式的抽象，从一般法则演出各种不可否认的经验的现象”。虽然他们没有真正去研究什么是按劳分配，按什么劳分配以及这个原则是由什么决定的？却可以根据一般的辩证法原理大谈特谈“按劳取酬”的积极性消极性的矛盾发展，黄伦同志这篇文章就是这样，他一看到有人提出生产决定分配的经济规律就会称之为机械论，宿命论，说他没有懂得生产与分配之间的辩证关系。而实际上恰恰是他自己就把这个原则作了“单纯的形式的抽象”。
    其次，更成问题的是：为什么强调了生产决定分配的经济规律就会是“见物不见人”呢？难道人的主观能动作用和政治挂帅以及对经济规律的认识、利用等，可以不从生产出发，可以不根据经济规律吗？难道可以离开了客观规律性来强调人的主观能动作用么？
    我们所理解的任何个人，都是特定的生产关系的人格化，要真正理解社会主义制度下的“人”，就必须科学的分析社会主义生产、社会主义劳动。我已经说过社会主义劳动是一种具有自为的社会必要劳动性质的劳动。这是在社会主义所有制和旧的社会分工存在的条件下社会劳动的必然表现。“见物不见人”就是没有认识这种劳动的性质，就是看不见在“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义积极性”（毛主席）就是因为他们只看见这种劳动的实体（比如既没有拖拉机，还是使用手工工具的昨天的农民。）而看不见这种劳动的社会性质。就是“不辨虚实”。
    因此如果把人的主观能动作用看做是这种劳动的反映本来是不错的。但说它“实际上是望不到边的，”就可以知道，也没有懂得这种劳动，其实这种劳动的生产力比起雇佣劳动和小私有制的劳动来确实是高得不可比拟的，但它也是有局限性的。实际上即使到了共产主义高级阶段也不能离开了客观规律性来强调人的主观能动作用的。在现在来说离开了社会主义劳动，抽象的强调人的主观能动作用，就有走上唯心主义的危险。
    要真正理解社会主义劳动，只有坚持从生产出发，从科学的具体分析经济条件中去发现客观的经济规律，比如要懂得按劳分配，就必须具体分析在社会主义生产、交换中表现出来的社会主义劳动形态，理解了这种劳动的性质以后，才能真正理解这个原则。而不是一听到经济规律就视之为机械论、宿命论；一听到科学的经济分析，就视之为脱离实际。要知道离开了科学的抽象，如黄伦同志之于生产决定分配原则的理解一样，就会落到“单纯的形式的抽象”的资产阶级观点之中。因此，我认为在讨论这个问题上“务务虚”，对问题的解决是有帮助的。
