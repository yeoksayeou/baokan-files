To meet the needs of the great development of preschool education, Shandong Province is adopting various methods to vigorously cultivate kindergarten teachers.

Throughout the province, 174 kindergarten normal school classes have been established, with over 10,000 students. Most of these kindergarten normal schools are run by the communes. In Fanxian and Feicheng, each production management area or people's commune has established a kindergarten normal school. The kindergarten normal schools in Feicheng offer seven courses, including communist education, basic knowledge of preschool education, Chinese language, arithmetic, and music. The kindergarten normal schools in Fanxian offer three courses: politics, professional skills, and labor. The study period in these kindergarten normal schools is generally set at one to two years. Because there is an urgent need for caregivers, the schools are adopting crash methods, first spending three months or one month to help students understand the importance of preschool education work and the preliminary knowledge of educating young children, and then continuing to improve through rotational training.

In addition to running kindergarten normal schools, Shandong Province is also adopting the method of holding training classes for in-service caregivers to train preschool education teachers. Some of the students from Jinan Kindergarten Normal School and its affiliated preschool education training class have been assigned to various counties and cities to run caregiver training classes. The Yanggu County Preschool Education Training Class, in addition to the 630 preschool teachers who have already graduated, plans to train another 1,330 caregivers in four batches in the next two months. In the training, classroom teaching is combined with visits and internships, so that trainees can learn some practical and useful knowledge. Many caregivers have improved their ideological awareness and professional level after training. Some people, after studying, love preschool education more and do a very good job.

Various counties and cities have also adopted the following methods to cultivate kindergarten teachers: (1) Cities support the countryside. Cadres and nursery teachers from urban kindergartens are transferred to rural areas to train preschool caregivers in designated areas. Some urban public kindergartens and rural kindergartens exchange caregivers: urban ones go to rural areas to provide guidance, and rural ones go to urban areas to "study," learning from each other's strengths and making gains. (2) Publicly run schools support privately run schools. Jinan and Qingdao cities divide up guidance areas, with publicly run kindergartens being responsible for guiding privately run kindergartens in designated areas. (3) Primary schools are linked to kindergartens. Qingdao City and Fanxian County transfer primary school teachers or principals for preschool education training, and they serve as instructors to impart knowledge to kindergarten teachers near the primary schools. (4) Organize observation and teaching, on-site conferences, experience exchange meetings, and exhibitions to introduce advanced figures and advanced experiences.

Since the realization of people's communes in Shandong Province, kindergartens have developed very rapidly. Up to now, the number of children in kindergartens has reached one-third of the total number of children. These kindergartens include half-day care, full-day care, and some full-time care. The key to consolidating these kindergartens lies in improving the ideological awareness and professional level of kindergarten teachers, so that the food, accommodation, management, and education that children receive in kindergartens are better than at home. Therefore, party and government leaders at all levels in Shandong Province attach great importance to the issue of cultivating preschool education teachers. (Attached picture)

### 让孩子在幼儿园比在家里更好  山东大力培养幼儿教育师资

    让孩子在幼儿园比在家里更好
    山东大力培养幼儿教育师资
    本报讯  适应幼儿教育大发展的需要，山东省采用多种办法大力培养幼儿教育师资。
    全省各地已经办起幼儿师范一百七十四个班，学生一万多人。这些幼儿师范，大部分是各公社举办的。在范县和肥城，每个生产管理区或人民公社都办起幼儿师范。肥城办的幼儿师范，都设有共产主义教育、幼儿教育基础知识、语文、算术、音乐等七门课程。范县办的幼儿师范，设有政治、业务、劳动三种课程。这些幼儿师范的学习时间，一般定为一年到二年。因为目前急需教养员，各校都采取突击办法，先用三个月或一个月的时间，让学员们懂得幼儿教育工作的重要性和教育幼儿的初步知识，然后，再用轮训办法继续提高。
    除了办幼儿师范外，山东省还采取举办在职教养员训练班的方法，培训幼儿教育师资。济南幼儿师范及其附设的幼儿教育训练班的一部分学员，已分配到各个县市去办教养员训练班。阳谷县幼儿教育训练班除已有六百三十个幼儿教师结业外，这个县准备在今后两个月时间内分四批再训练教养员一千三百三十名。在训练中，课堂教学与参观实习相结合，使受训人员学到了一些实际有用的知识。很多教养员经过训练后，思想觉悟和业务水平都较前提高了。有的人经过学习后，更加热爱幼儿教育事业，工作做得很出色。
    各县、市还采取这样一些办法培养幼儿师资：（1）城市支援农村。抽调城市幼儿园的干部和保育教师到农村分片训练幼儿教养员。有的城市公办幼儿园和农村幼儿园互换教养员：城市的到农村进行辅导，农村的到城市“留学”，双方取长补短，都有收获。（2）公办支持民办。济南和青岛两市划分辅导区，由公办幼儿园分片负责辅导民办幼儿园。（3）小学和幼儿园挂钩。青岛市和范县抽调小学教师或小学校长进行幼儿教育训练，由他们作辅导员，再向小学附近的幼儿园教师传授。（4）组织观摩教学，现场会议，经验交流会展览会等，介绍先进人物和先进经验。
    山东省在实现人民公社化后，幼儿园发展十分迅速。到目前为止，在园幼儿已达到幼儿总数的三分之一。这些幼儿园中，有半日托的、日托的和一部分全日托的。要使这些幼儿园巩固下来，关键在于提高幼儿教师的思想觉悟和业务水平，使孩子们在幼儿园得到的食宿管理和教育都比在家庭里好。所以山东省各级党政领导上很重视培养幼儿教育师资的问题。（附图片）
