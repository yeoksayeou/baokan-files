Heilongjiang and Qinghai Promote the Spirit of Cooperation
Transfer Vegetables, Pigs, and Sheep to Support Other Provinces

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 22nd: The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to support Beijing, Liaoning and other regions with a large quantity of non-staple foods, while ensuring the necessary consumption of its own residents. Plans are underway to promptly purchase a batch of vegetables and live pigs for external transfer.

This year, vegetables in Heilongjiang Province have grown very well. From now until the new vegetables are grown next year, the province can provide an average of 1.6 jin of vegetables per person per day, which is double last year's amount, and in some places, the average can reach 3 jin per person per day. A large number of angled gourds and pumpkins can be made into dried vegetables. The pig-raising industry in rural areas has also developed significantly compared to previous years. Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, requested in a telephone conference with local Party committee secretaries on the evening of the 20th that all regions promote the spirit of communism, consume slightly fewer vegetables, and provide a batch of vegetables to supply cities, mines, forest areas, and other provinces. Although the province's hog procurement plan has already been overfulfilled, it is still necessary to mobilize people's communes to rapidly fatten existing live pigs in order to increase the supply of meat to cities and other provinces. In addition, all regions should mobilize urban and rural residents to produce fine vegetables such as garlic sprouts, spinach, and tomatoes by building earthen heated beds.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires people's communes in all regions to properly arrange the labor force for winter production and organize specialized production teams and transportation teams to transport large quantities of non-staple foods from rural areas to cities. Railway departments within Heilongjiang have already begun to allocate more than 200 freight cars daily to centrally transport non-staple foods.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 22nd: In order to ensure that urban and rural people have a happy New Year, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of relevant departments and Party secretaries of prefectures, cities, counties, and townships on the 21st, deciding to immediately organize the production and transfer of non-staple foods. Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, spoke at the meeting. He particularly pointed out: We must not only ensure that the people of Qinghai have a good New Year, but also have the obligation to provide fat sheep, beef cattle, wild cattle, yellow sheep, and Qinghai naked carp to support Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, and other places, so that the people there can also have a good New Year. The meeting determined that rural people's communes should produce a large quantity of non-staple foods, such as growing vegetables in greenhouses, fattening pigs, and processing vermicelli and bean sheets. People's communes in counties near Qinghai Lake and local garrison troops should send people to Qinghai Lake to catch fish. Herdsmen in pastoral areas and local garrison troops should hunt and kill wild animals such as yellow sheep and wild cattle. In addition to meeting the needs of the province, 40,000 fat sheep and more than 3.5 million jin of Qinghai naked carp should be transferred out before the Spring Festival, and 200 tons of beef should be transferred out around the Spring Festival.

In order to do a good job in the production and transfer of non-staple foods, a non-staple food supply office and a transportation command have been established under the leadership of the Provincial Committee.

    黑龙江青海发扬协作精神
    调运蔬菜猪羊支援外省
    新华社哈尔滨22日电  中共黑龙江省委决定在保证本省居民必需消费量的情况下，以大量的副食品支援北京、辽宁等地。计划在近期就抓紧采购一批蔬菜和生猪外调。
    今年黑龙江省蔬菜生长很好，从目前到明年新菜长成期间，全省每人每天可以吃到蔬菜一点六斤，超过去年一倍，个别地方平均每人每天可以吃到三斤。大批角瓜、窝瓜可以制成干菜。农村养猪事业比往年也有很大发展。中共黑龙江省委书记杨易辰20日晚间在各地委书记电话会议上，要求各地发扬共产主义精神，适当少消费一些蔬菜，拿出一批蔬菜来供应城市、矿山、林区和外省。全省生猪的收购计划虽然已经超额完成，但仍然要发动人民公社迅速育肥现有活猪，以增加对城市和省外的肉类供应量。此外，各地还要动员城乡居民通过搞土暖床的办法，生产蒜苗、菠菜、西红柿等细菜。
    中共黑龙江省委要求各地人民公社妥善安排冬季生产的劳动力，组织专业生产队、运输队，把农村中大量的副食品运往城市。黑龙江境内的铁路部门已经开始每天抽出二百多节货车，集中运输副食品。
    本报西宁22日电  为了使城乡人民高高兴兴地过个好年，中共青海省委在21日召集有关部门和州、市、县、乡党委书记开会，决定立即组织副食品生产和调运工作。省委第一书记高峰在会上讲了话。他特别指出：我们不仅要保证青海的城乡人民把年过好，也有义务拿出菜羊、菜牛、野牛、黄羊、湟鱼等，支援北京、天津、辽宁等地，让那里的人民也过个好年。会议确定，农村人民公社要大量生产副食品，如温室种菜、生猪催肥、加工粉条、粉皮等；青海湖附近县份的人民公社和当地驻军，要派人到青海湖捕鱼；牧区的牧民和当地驻军要捕打黄羊、野牛等野牲口。这些东西除供应本省需要外，在春节以前要外调四万只菜羊，三百五十多万斤湟鱼，春节前后要调出二百吨牛肉。
    为了做好副食品生产和调运工作，在省委领导下，分别成立了副食品供应办公室和运输指挥部。（附图片）
