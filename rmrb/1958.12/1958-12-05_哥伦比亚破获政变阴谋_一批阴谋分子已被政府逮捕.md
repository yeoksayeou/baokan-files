Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Bogota Dispatch: The Colombian government has smashed a coup plot hatched by former dictator Rojas Pinilla, who colluded with a group of military officers. Rojas Pinilla and a group of conspirators have been arrested.

Faced with the threat of a reactionary coup d'état by former dictator Rojas Pinilla, Colombian President Camargo has declared martial law throughout the country, effective December 3rd. At the same time, the army has occupied all strategic points in the capital and taken defensive measures for public buildings such as the parliament building.

It is reported that as early as November 29th, a riot occurred in the province of Huila in which reactionary elements killed forty peasants.

The conspiracy of this reactionary group was immediately met with strong opposition from all parties and the people of the capital in Colombia. Many leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties issued statements opposing the insidious coup plot. The Colombian Communist Party's organ, "Democratic Voice," also issued a call asking the people to be vigilant against the reactionary elements' attempt to launch a coup. At the same time, the people of Bogota are preparing to hold a demonstration on the 6th—on the eve of the opening of the 11th Congress of the Confederation of Colombian Workers—against the subversion plot.

    哥伦比亚破获政变阴谋
    一批阴谋分子已被政府逮捕
    新华社4日讯  波哥大消息：哥伦比亚政府破获了由前独裁者罗哈斯—皮尼亚纠合一批军官企图发动政变的阴谋。罗哈斯—皮尼亚和一批阴谋分子已经被逮捕。
    面临着前独裁者罗哈斯—皮尼亚制造反动政变的威胁，哥伦比亚总统卡马戈已经宣布从3日起在全国实行戒严。同时，陆军已经占领了首都全部的战略据点，并且对议会大厦等公共建筑物采取了防卫措施。
    据报道，早在上月29日，在乌伊拉省就发生了反动分子杀害四十个农民的暴乱事件。
    这次反动集团的阴谋一经揭露，立即遭到哥伦比亚各党派和首都人民的强烈反对。保守党和自由党的许多领导人发表谈话表示反对阴险的暴乱阴谋。哥伦比亚共产党机关报“民主呼声报”也发出号召，要求人民警惕反动分子发动政变的企图。同时，波哥大人民准备在6日——即哥伦比亚工人联合会第十一次代表大会开幕前夕举行反对颠复阴谋的示威游行。
