    According to Jiangxi Daily News, in order to ensure that urban and rural people happily celebrate New Year's Day and the Spring Festival, commercial departments in various parts of Jiangxi Province, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, have taken active action and made full material preparations. Up to now, the purchase volume of non-staple foods has increased significantly. In just one and a half months from November to mid-December, 5.83 million jin of sugar, 52.27 million jin of citrus, and 8 million jin of fresh fish have been purchased, and many more materials will be purchased successively before the Spring Festival. At the same time, activities to organize non-staple food sources outside the province have also been launched. It is expected that a large number of non-staple foods, dried and fresh fruits, salted dried vegetables, and aquatic products can be purchased from outside the province before the Spring Festival.
    The province has also made active arrangements for non-staple food processing. According to the processing raw materials and ingredients that have been mastered, it is estimated that the province can process more than 10 million jin of pastries, which will be 30% more than last year (excluding those processed by the people's communes). In terms of the allocation and arrangement of non-staple food materials, both urban and rural areas in the province have made reasonable arrangements.
    In organizing non-staple food production, commercial departments in various places generally closely combine it with sideline production. For example, Bizhou Township in Suichuan County implements comprehensive arrangements, organizes shock work to complete the central tasks, and squeezes out labor to develop winter bamboo shoots digging and magnolia slices processing. Yongfeng, Xiushui, Ningdu and other counties are vigorously developing potato flour processing to replenish non-staple food sources.
    While ensuring the supply of materials for urban and rural people to celebrate New Year's Day and the Spring Festival, various parts of the province have also given full play to the spirit of communist cooperation, and have transferred a large number of oranges, fresh fish, winter bamboo shoots, bayberries and orange wine to support Shanghai, Beijing, Liaoning and other eighteen provinces and cities.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 27th. People's communes in various parts of Jiangsu Province pay attention to rationally arranging their own consumption and selling more live pigs to the state to supply the people in cities and industrial and mining areas.
    In the past few days, the average number of live pigs sold to the state by communes in various parts of the province has increased from more than 6,000 heads in early December to 10,000 heads. In order to better supply the urban and industrial and mining areas with food for the New Year, the Qipan Commune in Xinyi County changed its original idea of keeping more for itself, and sold 700 fat pigs to the state in one day. The Party Secretary of Madian Commune in Taixing County took the lead, convened meetings of commune and team cadres, and repeatedly carried out publicity and education to all commune members. After learning about the non-staple food supply in the city, the commune members unanimously expressed that they would save the live pigs they eat themselves and supply the people in the city and industrial and mining areas to celebrate the festival. In two days, this commune sold 1,300 live pigs, exceeding the commune's entire monthly plan by more than 16%.
    Communes in various places have transferred a part of the labor force to transport the live pigs for sale to the transportation lines to facilitate the state's rapid transfer to the cities. As of the 23rd, the province has transferred more than 50,000 live pigs to Shanghai.
    According to Guangxi Daily News, Nanning City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has actively improved the supply of non-staple foods. At present, the average daily market supply of meat has increased from 30,000 to 35,000 jin before November to more than 37,000 jin; the average daily market supply of vegetables was only 10,000 to 20,000 jin in September, 30,000 to 40,000 jin in October, and about 100,000 jin in November, and it has now risen to 100,000 to 120,000 jin.
    The Nanning Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department, and the Nanning Municipal Bureau of Commerce have taken many measures to improve the supply of non-staple foods in the city, and organized a large number of people to go to various production areas to assist in purchasing. The city's vegetable, food, and grocery store sent more than 70 people to assist in the production of vegetables in the suburbs; and sent people to various production areas to organize the purchase of vegetables, buying as much as possible and whatever is available. Purchasers from meat and egg shops also went to Nanning, Guilin, and Liuzhou to organize sources of goods. In the past month or two, with the support of the Party committees in various production areas and the assistance of commercial departments, non-staple foods from various places have been continuously transported back to Nanning City, which has rapidly improved the supply situation in Nanning City.
    In order to facilitate the people's purchase and eliminate the phenomenon of crowding and queuing, commercial departments have added many retail outlets. Restaurants have opened nine affiliated canteens, the number of meat supply points has increased from twenty-seven to fifty, and the number of vegetable supply points has increased by twenty-two. Commercial departments also paid special attention to facilitating the masses in industrial and mining areas.
    According to Heilongjiang Daily News, Harbin City's New Year's non-staple foods are ready and have been allocated from wholesale departments to retail departments and have begun to be sold.
    The Party and government leading organs of Harbin City attach great importance to the supply of materials for the New Year and Spring Festival, and have long designated relevant departments to start preparing. The commercial departments have held many meetings to specifically study the issues of tapping sources of goods, conducting shock transportation, and improving distribution methods. They also sent people to the four counties under the city's jurisdiction to check and help purchase and transfer agricultural and sideline products, and to organize warm vegetables in the suburbs.
    In order to quickly transfer non-staple foods, the Municipal People's Committee transferred cars from the steel front to Zhaoyuan, Taikang and other places to transport fish; some districts used buses to transport materials; the processing departments also launched a bitter battle, the production of meat products jumped from 20,000 to 30,000 jin per day to 60,000 jin, and the production of pastries jumped from more than 40,000 jin per day to 130,000 jin. Retail stores throughout the city have adopted sales methods that facilitate the people. Such as delivering goods to the door with vouchers, selling goods with invoices, selling related goods comprehensively, entrusting agencies and streets to sell goods, and adding retail outlets.

    源源供应城乡副食品
    江西开辟货源，支援十八省市
    江苏外调生猪，供应城市厂矿
    南宁加强收购，充实市内供应
    哈市便利群众，改进售货办法
    据江西日报消息  为保证城乡人民愉快地度过元旦和春节，江西省各地商业部门在当地党委统一领导下，已积极行动起来，作好了充分的物资准备工作。到目前止，副食品收购量已有了显著的增加。仅从11月到12月中旬的一个半月中，已收购了食糖五百八十三万斤，柑桔五千二百二十七万斤，鲜鱼八百万斤，还有许多物资将在春节前陆续购进。同时在省外也展开了组织副食品货源的活动，预计在春节前可以从省外购进大量副食品、干鲜果、咸干菜、水产等。
    全省在副食品加工方面也作了积极的安排。根据现已掌握的加工原料和配料，预计全省可加工糕点千多万斤，将比去年增加30％（人民公社加工的不算在内）。在副食品物资调剂和摆布方面，全省城乡也都作了合理安排。
    各地商业部门在组织副食品生产工作上，一般都做到了密切与副业生产相结合。如遂川县碧洲乡实行全面安排，组织突击完成中心工作，挤出劳动力开展挖冬笋和加工玉兰片。永丰、修水、宁都等县正在大力开展加工薯粉，充实副食品货源。
    全省各地在保证作好城乡人民过好元旦和春节物资供应的同时，还充分地发挥了共产主义大协作精神，已调运大批桔柑、鲜鱼、冬笋和杨梅、桔子酒等，支援上海、北京、辽宁等十八个省市。
    新华社南京27日电  江苏省各地人民公社注意合理安排自己的消费，将更多的生猪出售给国家，供应城市和工矿区人民。
    近几天来，全省各地公社平均每天卖给国家的生猪，从12月上旬的六千多头上升到一万头。新沂县棋盘公社为了更好地供应城市和工矿区人民年节食用，改变了原来自己多留多吃的想法，一天中就卖给国家七百头肥猪。泰兴县马甸公社党委书记挂帅，召开社、队干部会议，并向全体社员反复进行宣传教育，社员们了解到城市副食品供应情况以后，一致表示要节省自己食用的生猪，供应城市和工矿区人民过好节。这个社两天中出售生猪一千三百头，超过公社全月计划16％以上。
    各地公社都抽调一部分劳力，把出售的生猪赶运到交通沿线，便于国家迅速转运到城市。到23日止，全省调运给上海的生猪已有五万多头。
    据广西日报消息  广西僮族自治区南宁市积极改进了副食品供应工作。目前，肉类供应每日平均上市量，由11月份以前的三万至三万五千斤增加到三万七千多斤；蔬菜每日平均上市量9月份仅一、二万斤，10月份为三、四万斤，11月份为十万斤左右，目前已升为十至十二万斤。
    中共南宁市委、市委财贸部和南宁市商业局，对改善市内副食品供应情况采取了许多措施，组织大批人员分赴各产地协助收购。市蔬菜食品杂货商店派出七十多人，协助郊区生产蔬菜；又派人分赴各产地组织收购蔬菜，有多少收多少，有什么收什么。肉食蛋品商店采购人员也分赴南宁、桂林、柳州各专区组织货源。近一、两月来，在各产地党委的支持和商业部门的协助下，各地副食品源源运回南宁市，使南宁市的供应情况迅速好转。
    为了方便群众购买，消灭拥挤排队现象，商业部门增设了许多零售点。饮食店开办附属食堂九个，肉类供应点由二十七个增至五十个，蔬菜供应点增加二十二个。商业部门还特别注意方便工矿区群众。
    据黑龙江日报消息  哈尔滨市新年副食品准备就绪，已经从批发部门往零售部门下拨，开始销售。
    哈尔滨市党政领导机关对新年、春节物资的供应工作非常重视，早就指定有关部门开始了准备工作。商业部门多次召开会议，具体研究了挖掘货源，突击运输，改进分配方法等问题。并派人到本市所属四个县检查和帮助采购、调运农副产品，到郊区组织暖菜。
    为了迅速调运副食品，市人委从钢铁战线抽出汽车到肇源、泰康等地运鱼；有的区用公共汽车运输物资；加工部门也展开了苦战，肉制品由过去日产二万到三万斤跃为六万斤，糕点由日产四万多斤跃到十三万斤。全市零售商店采取了便利群众的售货方法。如凭证商品送货到门，发票售货，有关商品综合售货，委托机关、街道售货、增设零售网点等。
