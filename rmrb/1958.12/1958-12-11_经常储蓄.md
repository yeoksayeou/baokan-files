    Frequent Savings
    In recent years, the social savings undertakings organized by the People's Bank of China have greatly developed. By mid-November of this year, the total urban savings in the country had reached 3.97 billion yuan. The people use these deposits to support the country's economic construction.
    Participating in social savings is not only beneficial to national economic construction, but frequent savings can also enable people to develop a diligent and thrifty work style, better arrange their own and their family's economic life, making life both planned and able to guard against occasional emergencies. We often see such situations in our daily lives: some people's wage income is not much, but because of frequent savings, they not only live comfortably, but also often have some surplus; in contrast, people who do not save on weekdays and have no plan for spending money, although their wage income is not small, still often "go hungry," and sometimes the difficulties in life cannot be solved for a while, which also affects work and study. From this, it can be seen that from the perspective of strengthening the planning of personal economic life, savings are needed and beneficial at any time.
    Deposits are a part of the surplus money that people save from their labor income, gradually accumulating it. It is a part of personal labor income, and individuals have full right to dispose of it. This was the case in the past, and it remains unchanged now and in the future. In order to support national economic construction and to rationally arrange our own economic life, everyone should actively and frequently participate in social savings.
    We also hope that comrades engaged in banking work will strive to improve business, facilitate depositors to deposit and withdraw money, and conscientiously implement the savings policy of "free deposit, free withdrawal, and confidentiality for depositors," and strive to attract more people to participate in savings frequently.

    经常储蓄
    几年来，国家银行举办的社会储蓄事业有了很大的发展，到今年11月中旬，全国城镇储蓄总额已达三十九亿七千多万元。人民用这些存款支援了国家的经济建设。
    参加社会储蓄不仅仅对国家经济建设有利，经常储蓄，能使人们养成勤劳俭朴的作风，更好地安排自己和家庭的经济生活，使生活过得既有计划，又可以防备不时的急需。我们在日常生活当中常常看到这样的情况：有的人工资收入不算多，但是因为经常储蓄，过生活不但过得很从容，而且经常还有一些结余；和这相反，平日不储蓄、用钱毫无计划的人，尽管工资收入不少，仍然常常“闹饥荒”，有时生活上的困难一时不能得到解决，还要影响工作、影响学习。由此可见，从加强个人经济生活的计划性这个意义上来说，储蓄在任何时候都是需要的，有好处的。
    存款是人们从劳动所得当中节约出一部分余钱，逐渐积累起来的，它是个人劳动所得的一部分，个人对它完全有权支配。这一点，过去如此，现在和将来也是不变的。为了支援国家经济建设，为了合理地安排自己的经济生活，大家都应当踊跃地、经常地参加社会储蓄。
    我们也希望从事银行工作的同志，努力改进业务，便利储户存、取，并认真贯彻“存款自由，取款自便，为储户保密”的储蓄政策，努力吸收更多的人经常参加储蓄。
