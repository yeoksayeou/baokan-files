    Communiqué of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Summary of the Communiqué:

    Comrade Mao Zedong presided over the meeting and delivered an important speech.

    The plenary session adopted the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes." The resolution believes that the people's commune movement in China's rural areas has great historical significance and elaborates on a series of issues related to people's communes from a theoretical and policy perspective.

    The plenary session summarized the main experiences of the unprecedentedly great victory in China's national economic development in 1958. The plenary session pointed out that the rapid development of the national economy proves that the Party's general line for socialist construction and the complete set of policies for walking on two legs are correct.

    The plenary session put forward the guidelines and some main indicators for the development of the national economy in 1959. The plenary session pointed out that to achieve the grand leap forward plan for the coming year, it is necessary to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent call to despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically, and to have both soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of scientific analysis.

    The plenary session agreed with Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal that he not be a candidate for the next term of Chairman of the People's Republic of China, pointing out that Comrade Mao Zedong's exclusive role as Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party will enable him to concentrate his energy on dealing with the Party and the country's guidelines, policies, and line, and to free up more time to engage in the theoretical work of Marxism-Leninism, without hindering him from continuing to play a leading role in the work of the country. This is more beneficial to the whole Party and the people of the whole country.

    The plenary session pointed out that, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, the general characteristic of the international situation is that "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The plenary session noted with satisfaction that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become stronger and more united. The plenary session believes that the seven-year plan proposed by the CPSU Central Committee is a program of communist construction with great historical significance.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Wuchang from November 28 to December 10, 1958.

    This meeting was conducted under the chairmanship of Comrade Mao Zedong. Eighty-four members of the Central Committee, including Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping, Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Peng Zhen, Luo Ronghuan, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Li Xiannian, Ke Qingshi, Li Jingquan, and Tan Zhenlin, and eighty-two alternate members of the Central Committee attended the meeting. Responsible comrades of relevant departments of the Central Committee and first secretaries of the Party committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, who were not members or alternate members of the Central Committee, also attended the meeting as observers.

    Prior to the Sixth Plenary Session, Comrade Mao Zedong convened a meeting in Zhengzhou from November 2 to 10, attended by some central leading comrades and some local leading comrades, and then convened a meeting in Wuchang from November 21 to 27, attended by some central leading comrades and the first secretaries of the Party committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, to prepare for this plenary session.

    The main agenda of the Eighth Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session was: issues concerning people's communes, issues concerning the national economic plan for 1959, and the issue of not nominating Comrade Mao Zedong as a candidate for the next term of Chairman of the People's Republic of China. In addition, the meeting also discussed the issue of improving the rural financial and trade management system and the international situation. After full and in-depth discussions in group meetings and plenary sessions, the plenary session adopted corresponding resolutions. Comrade Mao Zedong made an important speech at the meeting.

    The Eighth Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session adopted the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes." The resolution gave a high evaluation of the people's commune movement in China's rural areas in the past few months, considering it an event of great historical significance. The resolution elaborated on a series of issues related to people's communes from a theoretical and policy perspective. The resolution made provisions for the correct development direction of people's communes, the production policy of the communes, the implementation of a distribution system combining wages and supply systems, the organization of people's production and life, the implementation of the organizational principle of democratic centralism, and the strengthening of Party leadership, the promotion of the mass line, and the style of seeking truth from facts. The resolution requires Party committees at all levels to seize the five months from December this year to April next year, closely combining them with the production tasks of winter and spring, to conduct a rectification and consolidation of people's communes in their regions.

    The Eighth Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session summarized the main experiences of China's national economic development in 1958 and put forward the guidelines for national economic development in 1959. The plenary session pointed out that in 1958, China's national economic development achieved unprecedentedly great victories. According to the current estimates of the total output of industrial and agricultural products for the whole year of 1958, steel will increase from 5.35 million tons in 1957 to about 11 million tons, coal will increase from 130 million tons in 1957 to about 270 million tons, machine tools will increase from 28,000 units in 1957 to about 90,000 units, grain will increase from 370 billion jin in 1957 to about 750 billion jin, and cotton will increase from 32.8 million dan in 1957 to about 67 million dan. The output of other important industrial and agricultural products has also increased significantly. The total output value of industry and agriculture is expected to increase by about 70 percent in 1958 compared to 1957, while it only increased by 68 percent from 1952 to 1957; financial revenue is expected to increase by about 14 billion yuan in 1958 compared to 1957, while it only increased by 13.4 billion yuan from 1952 to 1957; and investment in capital construction is expected to be completed at more than 22 billion yuan in 1958, close to half of the total investment of 49.2 billion yuan during the First Five-Year Plan period.

    The plenary session pointed out that the great leap forward in all aspects of China's industrial and agricultural production and scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings in 1958, the great improvement of the socialist and communist consciousness of the people, and the upsurge of the people's commune movement that emerged between the summer and autumn of this year are the great victories of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the great achievements of the nationwide rectification campaign. China's economic construction achievements are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. This year's rapid development of China's national economy proves the Party's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, the policy of simultaneously developing heavy and light industries, the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward on the industrial front, the policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, the policy of simultaneously using indigenous and foreign methods of production, and the policy that centralized leadership in industry must be combined with large-scale mass movements in industry, in short, the policy of walking on two legs, rather than walking on one leg or one and a half legs, is a correct set of policies. The great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production in 1958 is great practice. Through this practice, we have not only found a broad road for building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way but also gained rich experience on this broad road. This makes it possible for us not only to continue to leap forward in 1959 but also to leap forward even better.

    The plenary session pointed out that based on the great victories and rich experiences of 1958, in socialist economic construction in 1959, it is necessary to continue to oppose conservatism, eliminate superstition, implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to implement the policies of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy and light industries, simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, and simultaneously using indigenous and foreign methods of production, and continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward in industry and the policy of combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements. At the same time, it is necessary to strive to base the economic plan on a fully reliable basis and strive to maintain appropriate proportions among the various indicators according to the objective law of proportionate development of various sectors of the national economy. Based on these guidelines and principles, the Central Plenary Session proposed some main indicators for the development of the national economy in 1959: steel production will increase from the estimated output of about 11 million tons this year to about 18 million tons, coal production will increase from the estimated output of about 270 million tons this year to about 380 million tons, grain production will increase from the estimated output of about 750 billion jin this year to about 1,050 billion jin, and cotton production will increase from the estimated output of about 67 million dan this year to about 100 million dan. The plenary session instructed the competent authorities to prepare the national economic plan for 1959 based on these main indicators, the needs of the entire national economic development in 1959, and China's material and technical conditions, and submit it to the First Session of the Second National People's Congress for discussion and approval.

    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent call to despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically, and to have both soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of scientific analysis, the plenary session pointed out that in order to achieve the national economic plan for 1959, we must continue to oppose conservatism, eliminate superstition, advocate daring to think, speak, and act, go all out, aim high, and strive for the upper reaches, and we must despise difficulties strategically, which is a firm and unswerving policy. At the same time, we must value difficulties tactically, earnestly advocate hard work, bitter work, and clever work, advocate "ten points of indicators and twelve points of measures," advocate realistic calculations, arrangements, and inspections, oppose exaggeration, and oppose concealing shortcomings. Economic work must be done more and more carefully and must be as close to reality or in line with reality as possible.

    The plenary session also pointed out that in order to achieve the plan for 1959, it is necessary to continue to adhere to putting politics in command, relying on the masses, continuing to adopt the mass line in construction work, and carrying out mass movements; the entire Party and the entire people must work together, and all local interests must be subordinate to the overall interests.

    The plenary session believes that the national economic plan for 1959 formulated according to the above main indicators will be a grand leap forward plan. The plenary session called on the entire Party and the entire people to unite as one, bravely struggle along the victorious road of 1958, strive to complete and overfulfill the national economic plan for 1959, and achieve a greater leap forward than in 1958 in the decisive year of three years of hard work in our country. The plenary session believes that the people of our country will be able to complete this glorious task.

    After full and multifaceted consideration, the Eighth Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session decided to agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal that he not be a candidate for the next term of Chairman of the People's Republic of China. The decision on this issue adopted by the plenary session pointed out that this is entirely a positive suggestion. Because Comrade Mao Zedong does not hold the position of Chairman of the State, but only serves as Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party, it will enable him to concentrate his energy on dealing with the Party and the country's guidelines, policies, and line, and it may also enable him to free up more time to engage in the theoretical work of Marxism-Leninism, without hindering him from continuing to play a leading role in the work of the country. This is more beneficial to the whole Party and the people of the whole country.

    The plenary session passed a resolution on improving the rural financial and trade management system. This decision will be jointly issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council after being submitted to the State Council for discussion and approval.

    The Eighth Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session also discussed the international situation. The plenary session pointed out that the development of the international situation in recent times has further proved that the forces of peace are greater than the forces of war, and the forces of progress are greater than the forces of reaction, further encouraging the people of the world and all people who love peace, advocate peaceful coexistence, and do not want war, and putting the manufacturers of war in an unprecedentedly isolated position. The imperialist camp is riddled with contradictions, and their so-called "unity" is in the process of gradually moving towards its opposite, that is, gradually moving towards disintegration. This process may be quite long, but the general trend is inevitable. Faced with the growing and powerful forces of peace, socialist forces, and national revolutionary forces, the imperialists are in a state of great panic. Their days are not good. As Comrade Mao Zedong said at this plenary session, the general characteristic of the international situation is that "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day."

    The plenary session pointed out that in the past year, the struggle of the people of the world for peace and liberation has made great progress. The struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence is continuing to surge. The recent reactionary coups in France and some other countries are by no means a sign of the strength of the reactionaries, but rather a sign of their decay and fragility. They are acting as "negative teachers" for the people, using their reactionary actions to teach the people, making the people have to further awaken and unite. The adventures and struggles of imperialist war maniacs and reactionaries cannot save their final demise. It will not work for US imperialism to stay in Taiwan. If the US aggressor troops do not withdraw themselves, then the Chinese on the mainland and Taiwan will eventually unite and drive them away. Similarly, it will not work for US Imperialism to stay in South Korea, South Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, West Berlin, West Germany , Western Europen, North Africa, the Middle East and other foreign military bases. If the US aggressor troops do not withdraw themselves, the peoples of all countries will unite and drive them away.

    The plenary session noted with satisfaction that in the past year, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become stronger and more united. All provocations, curses, and sabotage by imperialist reactionaries and revisionists are doomed to failure. The plenary session was excited about the Soviet Central Committee's plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965, believing that it is a program of communist construction with great historical significance. It represents the lofty hopes and bright future of progressive humanity, and its realization will greatly change the balance of power in the world and greatly benefit the cause of human peace in stopping war. The plenary session is deeply convinced that in the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism, socialism will surely surpass capitalism. (Attached picture)

    新华社17日讯  中国共产党第八届中央委员会第六次全体会议公报：
    中国共产党第八届中央委员会第六次全体会议一九五八年十一月二十八日至十二月十日在武昌举行。
    这次会议是在毛泽东同志主持下进行的。参加这次会议的有刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、林彪、邓小平、林伯渠、董必武、彭真、罗荣桓、陈毅、李富春、彭德怀、刘伯承、贺龙、李先念、柯庆施、李井泉、谭震林等中央委员八十四人，候补中央委员八十二人。不是中央委员和候补中央委员的中央有关部门的负责同志和省、市、自治区党委第一书记，也列席了会议。
    在六中全会之前，十一月二日至十日，毛泽东同志曾在郑州召集了有部分中央领导同志和部分地方领导同志参加的会议，随后又在十一月二十一日至二十七日在武昌召集了有部分中央领导同志和各省、市、自治区党委第一书记参加的会议，为这次全会作了准备。
    八届六中全会的主要议程是：关于人民公社问题，关于一九五九年国民经济计划问题，关于不提名毛泽东同志作下届中华人民共和国主席候选人问题。此外，还讨论了改进农村财政贸易管理体制问题和国际形势问题。全会经过小组会议和全体会议的充分的深入的讨论，通过了相应的决议。毛泽东同志在会议上作了重要讲话。
    八届六中全会通过了“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”。决议对于过去几个月中我国农村的人民公社运动给了很高的评价，认为这是具有伟大历史意义的事件。决议从理论上和政策上阐述了有关人民公社的一系列的问题。决议对于人民公社的正确发展方向，对于公社的生产方针，对于实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，对于组织人民的生产和生活，对于贯彻执行民主集中制的组织原则，对于加强党的领导、发扬群众路线和实事求是的作风等问题，都作了规定。决议要求各级党委抓紧今年十二月至明年四月的五个月时间，紧密结合冬季和春季的生产任务，对本地区人民公社进行一次整顿和巩固的工作。
    八届六中全会总结了一九五八年我国国民经济发展的主要经验，提出了一九五九年国民经济发展的方针。全会指出：一九五八年我国国民经济的发展，获得了空前伟大的胜利。根据现在对一九五八年全年工农业产品产量的预计，钢将由一九五七年的五百三十五万吨增加到一千一百万吨左右，煤炭将由一九五七年的一亿三千万吨增加到二亿七千万吨左右，机床将由一九五七年的二万八千台增加到九万台左右，粮食将由一九五七年的三千七百亿斤增加到七千五百亿斤左右，棉花将由一九五七年的三千二百八十万担增加到六千七百万担左右。其他重要工农业产品的产量，也都有巨大的增长。工农业总产值，一九五八年预计比一九五七年增长百分之七十左右，而一九五七年比一九五二年才增长了百分之六十八；财政收入，一九五八年预计比一九五七年增加一百四十亿元左右，而一九五七年比一九五二年才增加了一百三十四亿元；基本建设投资，一九五八年预计可以完成二百二十亿元以上，接近第一个五年计划期间投资总额四百九十二亿元的一半。
    全会指出，一九五八年我国工农业生产和科学文化教育事业各方面的大跃进，人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟的大大提高，以及在今年夏秋之间出现的人民公社化高潮，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是全民整风运动的伟大成果。我国经济建设的成就，是同苏联和各兄弟国家的援助分不开的。今年我国国民经济的飞跃发展，证明了党的在优先发展重工业的基础上实行工业和农业同时并举的方针，重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针，在工业战线上以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，土法生产和洋法生产同时并举的方针，以及工业方面的集中领导必须同在工业方面大搞群众运动相结合的方针，一句话，用两条腿走路的方针，而不是一条腿或者一条半腿走路的方针，这样的一整套方针是正确的。一九五八年我国工农业生产的大跃进，是一个伟大的实践。通过这个实践，我们不但找到了一条多快好省地建设社会主义的康庄大道，并且在这条康庄大道上取得了丰富的经验。这就使得我们不但有可能在一九五九年继续跃进，并且有可能跃进得更好。
    全会指出，在一九五八年伟大胜利和丰富经验的基础上，在一九五九年社会主义经济建设中需要继续反对保守，破除迷信，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线，继续实行工业和农业并举、重工业和轻工业并举、中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举、洋法生产和土法生产并举的方针，在工业中继续实行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针和集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合的方针。同时，需要努力使经济计划建立在充分可靠的基础上，并且根据国民经济各部门按比例发展的客观法则，努力使各项指标相互保持适当的比例。中央全会根据这些方针和原则，提出一九五九年国民经济发展的一些主要指标：钢产量将从今年预计产量一千一百万吨左右增加到一千八百万吨左右，煤炭产量将从今年预计产量二亿七千万吨左右增加到三亿八千万吨左右，粮食产量将从今年预计产量七千五百亿斤左右增加到一万零五百亿斤左右，棉花产量将从今年预计产量六千七百万担左右增加到一亿担左右。全会责成主管部门根据这些主要指标，根据一九五九年整个国民经济发展的需要和我国物质技术条件，编制一九五九年度国民经济计划，提交第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议讨论通过。
    根据毛泽东同志历来提出的在战略上要藐视困难、在战术上要重视困难，既要有冲天的干劲、又要有科学分析的精神，全会指出，为了实现一九五九年国民经济计划，我们一定要继续反对保守，破除迷信，提倡敢想敢说敢做，鼓足干劲，力争上游，一定要在战略上藐视困难，这是坚定不移的方针。与此同时，我们一定又要在战术上重视困难，认真提倡实干苦干巧干，提倡“十分指标、十二分措施”，提倡切实的计算、安排和检查，反对浮夸，反对隐瞒缺点。经济工作一定要愈作愈细致，一定要尽可能地接近实际或者符合实际。
    全会还指出，为了实现一九五九年的计划，必须继续坚持政治挂帅、依靠群众，在建设工作中继续采取群众路线，开展群众运动；全党全民必须一致努力，一切局部利益必须服从整体利益。
    全会认为，根据上述主要指标制订的一九五九年国民经济计划将是一个宏伟的跃进计划。全会号召全党全民团结一致，沿着一九五八年的胜利道路英勇奋斗，争取完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划，使我国在苦战三年的决定性的一年中，实现比一九五八年更伟大的跃进。全会相信，我国人民一定能够完成这个光荣的任务。
    八届六中全会在经过了充分的、多方面的考虑以后，决定同意毛泽东同志提出的关于他不作下届中华人民共和国主席候选人的建议。全会通过的关于这个问题的决定指出，这完全是一个积极的建议。因为毛泽东同志不担任国家主席的职务，专做党中央的主席，可以使他更能够集中精力来处理党和国家的方针、政策、路线的问题，也有可能使他腾出较多的时间，从事马克思列宁主义的理论工作，而并不妨碍他对于国家工作继续发挥领导作用。这样，对于全党和全国人民都更为有利。
    全会通过了关于改进农村财政贸易管理体制的决定。这个决定将在提交国务院讨论通过之后，由中共中央和国务院联合发布。
    八届六中全会还讨论了国际形势。全会指出，最近时期国际形势的发展，进一步证明了和平的力量大于战争的力量，进步的力量大于反动的力量，进一步鼓舞了全世界的人民和一切爱好和平、主张和平共处、不愿意战争的人们，而使战争的制造者陷入空前孤立的地位。帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重，他们的所谓“团结”，正在处于逐步走向反面即逐步走向四分五裂的过程中，这个过程可能还相当长，但是总的趋势是不可避免的。面对着日益增长的强大的和平力量、社会主义力量和民族革命力量，帝国主义者正在大起恐慌。他们的日子很不好过。正如毛泽东同志在这次全会上所说的，国际形势的总的特点是，“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    全会指出，过去一年中，全世界人民争取和平和解放的斗争有了很大的发展。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，正在继续高涨中。最近法国和其他某些国家的反动政变，决不是表示反动派的强大，而是表示了他们的腐朽和脆弱。他们正在充当人民的“反面教员”，用他们的反动行为使人民得到教训，使人民不能不进一步觉悟和团结起来。帝国主义战争狂人和反动派的冒险和挣扎，都不可能挽救他们的最后的灭亡。美帝国主义想赖在台湾不走是不行的；如果美国侵略军不自己撤走的话，那么，在大陆和台湾的中国人终将团结起来把它赶走。同样，美帝国主义想赖在南朝鲜、南越、日本、菲律宾、西柏林、西德、西欧、北非、中东以及其他外国的军事基地不走，是不行的；如果美国侵略军不自己撤走的话，那么，同样，各国人民必将团结起来把它赶走。
    全会满意地指出，在过去一年中，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加壮大了，团结得更加巩固了。帝国主义反动派和修正主义者的一切挑拨、咒骂和破坏，都注定要失败。全会对苏共中央提出的一九五九年至一九六五年苏联发展国民经济计划感到兴奋，认为这是一个具有伟大历史意义的建设共产主义的纲领。它代表着进步人类的崇高的希望和美好的未来，它的实现将大大改变世界的力量对比，大大有利于人类制止战争的和平事业。全会深信，在社会主义同资本主义的和平竞赛中，社会主义必将胜过资本主义。（附图片）
