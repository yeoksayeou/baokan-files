Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- The State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power jointly convened a national on-site conference on increasing equipment output in the electricity industry from December 3rd to 9th in Beijing. The conference focused on introducing the successful experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant in increasing the output of existing power generation equipment to power plant representatives from across the country.

The conference believes that under the current situation of tight power supply, in addition to focusing on motor manufacturing and accelerating the construction of large, medium, and small power plants, vigorously increasing the equipment output of old power plants is a major and effective measure that yields immediate results. Based on the Shijingshan Power Plant's experience of increasing equipment output by 24%, the conference pointed out that if all existing power plants across the country can effectively promote this experience, the nation's existing power generation capacity can be rapidly increased by at least hundreds of thousands of kilowatts without any additional investment, equipment, or manpower; this figure is equivalent to one-third of the power generation equipment capacity actually put into production nationwide during the First Five-Year Plan.

The Shijingshan Power Plant, without adding any equipment or materials, gained an additional 27,500 kilowatts of power generation capacity in less than a month, partially solving Beijing's electricity shortage problem.

The Shijingshan Power Plant's increase in output was achieved under the leadership of the Party Committee, by adopting a method combining cadres, workers, and technicians, breaking down superstition, daring to think and act, relying on science, and through experimentation. They carefully studied the technical indicators of the main links of the boiler, steam turbine, and generator. The workers provided suggestions for increasing output based on their years of operational experience. Technicians performed theoretical calculations and technical appraisals based on the workers' suggestions and the potential in the design, and adopted safety measures for some weak links. During the process of increasing output, they listened, looked, and felt, carefully observing changes in the machine's sound, vibration, temperature, and expansion position to ensure that the machine gradually increased its power generation capacity under safe operating conditions. The representatives who attended the meeting visited the power plant's production process after increasing output and carefully observed the operation of the machine, electrical, and furnace systems. After conducting professional discussions, they affirmed that the Shijingshan Power Plant's experience in increasing output had the following advantages: no need to increase investment or equipment; simple and easy to implement methods, and no difficult technical improvements; and, more importantly, a rapid increase in power generation capacity.

After the power plant increases its output, it is necessary to correspondingly increase the output of power supply. The conference also introduced the experience of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau in increasing the power transmission capacity of transmission and distribution lines. This power supply bureau, without state investment or additional equipment, has already doubled the load capacity of seventeen distribution lines with a total length of eighty-five kilometers by increasing the voltage of the distribution lines, connecting small transformers in series, and changing the wiring method. At the same time, it also used spray cooling to cool the transformers, which improved the transformation capacity. These measures can not only increase output but also save a large amount of copper and aluminum for the country and reduce line losses by more than one million kilowatt-hours of electricity by the end of the year.

The conference pointed out that in the past, the power industry strictly adhered to rules and regulations in production and operation, and had achieved certain results in terms of safe production. However, many units regarded the rules and regulations as rigid and opposed more power generation to safety, which constrained the thinking of employees. Therefore, the conference requested that power industry production departments launch a technical innovation movement with more power generation as the guiding principle in the future, and vigorously tap the potential of old power plants.

### 要想很快增电力  老厂先把潜力挖  全国电力会议推广提高设备出力经验

    要想很快增电力
    老厂先把潜力挖
    全国电力会议推广提高设备出力经验
    新华社11日讯  国家经济委员会和水利电力部3日到9日在北京联合召开了全国电力工业提高设备出力的现场会议。会议向来自全国各地的电厂代表着重介绍了石景山发电厂提高现有发电设备出力的成功经验。
    会议认为，在目前电力供应紧张的情况下，除了抓紧电机制造和加快大中小电厂的建设以外，大力提高老电厂的设备出力，是一项立竿见影的重大有效的措施。会议根据石景山发电厂提高设备出力24％的经验指出，全国现有电厂如果都能很好地推广这一经验，在不增加任何投资、设备和人力的情况下，全国现有的发电能力至少可以迅速增长数十万瓩；这个数字相当于第一个五年计划期间全国实际投入生产的发电设备能力的三分之一。
    石景山发电厂没有增添任何器材设备，在不到一个月的时间内，多获得了两万七千五百瓩的发电能力，部分地解决了北京缺电问题。
    石景山发电厂提高出力是在党委领导下，采取干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法，破除迷信、敢想敢干，依靠科学，通过试验获得的。他们认真研究了锅炉、汽轮机、发电机各主要环节的技术指标，工人们根据多年的操作经验提供提高出力的意见，技术员根据工人意见和设计中的潜力进行理论计算、技术鉴定，并且对部分薄弱环节采取了安全措施。在提高出力过程中，做到听、看、摸，仔细观测机器的声音、震动、温度、膨胀位置等变化，保证机器在安全运转的情况下逐步提高发电能力。到会的代表参观了这个电厂提高出力后的生产过程，并且仔细观测机、电、炉各个系统运行情况，进行专业讨论以后，肯定石景山发电厂提高出力的经验有以下的好处：不需要增加投资、设备；方法简便易行，技术改进不困难；更重要的是很快地增加了发电能力。
    电厂提高出力后，必须相应地提高供电的出力。会议还介绍了北京供电局提高送、配电线路送电能力的经验。这个供电局也不用国家投资和增添设备，采用配电线路升压、小变压器串联和改变结线方法，已经使共长八十五公里的十七条配电线路的负荷能力增长了一倍；同时还采用喷雾冷却法使变压器降温，提高了变电能力。采取这些措施不仅可以提高出力，而且还可以为国家节省大量铜铝，到年底还可降低线路损耗一百多万度电。
    会议指出，过去电力工业生产操作严守规章制度，在安全生产方面曾经获得了一定的成绩；但是不少单位把规章看成死的，把多发电同安全对立起来，这就束缚了职工的思想。因此，会议要求电力工业生产部门今后开展一个以多发电为纲的技术革新运动，大挖老电厂的潜力。（附图片）
