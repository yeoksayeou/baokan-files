The Man Who Conquered the Cultural Fortress
——Taiyuan Iron and Steel Worker Jiao Qinghu Studies Culture and Promotes Production
By our reporter

How did Jiao Qinghu, a worker who rose from illiteracy to a level of intermediate technical expertise and an eighth-grade fitter, achieve this?

Jiao Qinghu herded sheep and drove carts for landlords and worked as an apprentice in factories. Before liberation, in those dark days, he naturally had no opportunity to learn. After liberation, he entered the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company as a worker. Later, he gradually understood that workers had to be masters of their own affairs and could not work as they had in the old society. He wanted to improve technology, but what could he do without education? Just as Jiao Qinghu was distressed, the factory Party committee called on workers to study culture. This was like sending charcoal in the snow for Jiao Qinghu. In 1952, he rushed to join the literacy class.

Jiao Qinghu went to school. During the day, after work or on the way home, he was always muttering, either memorizing new characters or reading textbooks. At night, after his wife and children had gone to sleep, he practiced writing under the lamp. After four months of diligent study day and night, Jiao Qinghu finally shed his illiteracy. But he was not satisfied. He thought that to master scientific theories and modern technology, this amount of education was not enough. Therefore, he also studied mathematics, physics, mechanics and other scientific and technical knowledge at the workers' spare-time cultural school. Once, he asked several technically skilled people a few questions, and they said coldly: You are far from it! Mastering scientific and technical knowledge cannot be achieved in one breath. Jiao Qinghu went to his good friend, lathe operator Li Jinxi, with a belly full of anger. Li Jinxi shook his hand tightly and said, "Qinghu! If no one teaches you, I will teach you." He felt infinitely warm. From then on, in addition to attending spare-time school, he often studied with Li Jinxi.

After learning culture, Jiao Qinghu became the master of the machine. He said: In the past, when I worked, I just copied blindly, which was often inaccurate and laborious. Now, when I work, I not only rely on experience, but also use scientific theoretical knowledge, which makes my work easier and of higher quality. Once, when the open-hearth furnace workshop was installing a three-and-a-half-ton high trolley, the high trolley hook was too large to be installed, and he suggested changing the large hook to a small hook; some people objected, arguing that the hook was too small and would crack. But Jiao Qinghu knew that by reducing the size of the hook where it did not bear the force and leaving the weight-bearing part untouched, the load-bearing capacity would remain the same. As a result, the hook was modified, which not only put the three-and-a-half-ton high trolley into production in a timely manner, but also inspired the enthusiasm of workers to learn culture. The workers said: "Having culture is really useful! We must also study culture well."

Jiao Qinghu deeply realized the urgent need of the workers to study culture. In August, with the support of the Party branch, he and Li Jinxi, the foreman, founded a metallurgical equipment technical school for the machine repair section. The school was located in the workshop, and he and Li Jinxi were both teachers and students. They also jointly compiled a set of textbooks closely related to production and the actual needs of the workers. In the past, when Jiao Qinghu taught apprentices, he only hated that he was not educated enough, like boiling dumplings in a teapot, full of knowledge but unable to express it. Now, he picked up chalk and wrote and drew on the blackboard, with both theory and practice, and the apprentices listened with relish.

Having mastered cultural and scientific knowledge, Jiao Qinghu became an outstanding technical innovation expert on the iron and steel front. In September of this year, the Party committee called on employees to break through backward key points and ensure the realization of the leap forward steel production plan. At that time, the backward key point of the ingot casting workshop of the Second Steelmaking Plant was that the molten steel flowing out of the steel ingot often failed to align with the mold opening, resulting in frequent spillage accidents and affecting the tapping of steel. Jiao Qinghu began to consider eliminating this accident. One day, the director of the factory asked the workers of the machine repair section: "Can you solve this problem?" Jiao Qinghu, who was thinking about the problem, suddenly stood up and answered loudly: "Yes!" After the meeting, he lay in bed thinking: If the steel casting frame could move, then the steel cylinder could be freely controlled. But a steel cylinder weighs 75 tons, which is difficult to move. He thought for a long time and finally came up with a plan: using the principle of pulleys in physics, install a sliding device on the steel casting bracket. He drew up a chart overnight, wrote a plan, and the next day sought the opinions of the workers and jointly formulated a technical improvement plan. This plan was supported by the director of the workshop, and Jiao Qinghu immediately fought with all the workers in the section for three days and successfully assembled it on October 18. Since then, the 75-ton steel cylinder has been tamed and the accident of running steel has been eliminated.

Not long ago, when Jiao Qinghu was working in the open-hearth furnace workshop, he heard the workers say that there was a problem with the design of the drawbar of the three-spout steel distribution rudder. It was awkward, hindered the operation of the workers, and could cause steel overflow accidents. The drawbar of the steel distribution rudder used to control the molten steel in the three-spout steel tapping of the open-hearth furnace was originally designed and installed by engineering technicians. After Jiao Qinghu observed the site, he found that on a platform less than two meters wide and five meters long, four drawbars were installed, and six people had to operate under high temperature. It was difficult to balance the force, how could there be no steel overflow, how could it not hinder the operation of the workers? Therefore, he decided to improve this technical design. He used the principle of leverage and production experience to make a new technical setting. At that time, it was opposed by some engineering and technical personnel. However, Jiao Qinghu insisted on his own design device and carried out experiments with the support of the leadership and the workers. The experiment proved that the newly designed device was much better than the original one, removing the four drawbars on the platform, and only one person needed to operate the machine, which not only reduced the labor intensity of the workers, but also reduced the number of workers, and at the same time avoided steel overflow accidents.

Now, Jiao Qinghu is a famous "all-rounder" in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, mastering nine technologies such as fitter, planer, riveter, oxygen welding, forging, and shovel truck operator. He said excitedly: It is the Communist Party that has cultivated me into a cultured worker. (Attached image)

    攻克文化堡垒的人
    ——太钢工人焦庆虎学习文化推动生产
    本报记者
    一个由文盲提高到中等技术专业交化水平和八级钳工的工人——焦庆虎，他是怎样走过来的呢？
    焦庆虎，他给地主放过羊，赶过大车，到工厂当过徒工。解放前，在那黑暗的日子里，学文化自然没有他的份儿。解放后，他进太原钢铁公司当工人。后来，他慢慢懂得工人要当家做主，不能像在旧社会干活一样。他想改进技术，可是没有文化，怎么办呢？ 正当焦庆虎苦恼的时候，厂党委会号召工人学文化。这对焦庆虎说来，真是雪里送炭。1952年，他抢先进了扫盲班学习。
    焦庆虎上学了。白天，劳动之余或者回家途中，他嘴里总是念念有词，不是记生字，便是读课本；夜晚，爱人和孩子睡静了，他在灯下练习写字。四个月日日夜夜勤学苦练，焦庆虎终于摆脱了文盲状态。但他并不满足，他想，要掌握科学理论和现代化技术，光靠这点文化是不行的。于是，又在职工业余文化学校学习数学、物理、机械等科学技术知识。有一次，他向几位知识分子出身的技术人员提出几个问题，他们冷冷地说：你还差的远呢！要掌握科学技术知识可不是一口气吹成功的。焦庆虎蹩着一肚子气到他的好朋友车工李近溪跟前，李近溪紧握着他的手说：“庆虎啊！没有人教，我来教你。”他深深感到无限温暖。从此，他除了上业余学校外，常同李近溪在一起学习。
    焦庆虎学习文化以后，成了机器的主人。他说：过去做活时照猫画虎，往往不准确，又费力气；如今做活时，就不光凭经验，还运用科学理论知识，干起活来省力，质量高。有一次，平炉车间装置一台三吨半高车时，高车吊钩太大不能安装，他建议把大钩改为小钩；有人反对，理由是钩子小要裂断。但焦庆虎心里有数，把钩子不出力的地方改小，承担重量的地方不动，钩子虽然小了，负荷量是不变的。结果，改制了吊钩，不仅使三吨半高车及时投入生产，而且启发了工人学习文化的积极性。工人说：“有了文化真顶事啊！咱们也得好好学文化。”
    焦庆虎切身体会到工人们对学习文化的迫切要求，8月，他和李近溪、工段长在党支部的支持下，创办了一所机修工段冶金设备专科学校，学校就设在车间，他和李近溪是老师，也是学生。他们还共同编写了一套紧密结合生产和工人实际需要的教材。过去，焦庆虎教徒工时，只恨自己文化低，茶壶里煮饺子，肚里有嘴里可倒不出来。现在，他拿起粉笔在黑板上连写带画，既有理论，又有实际，徒工们听得津津有味。
    掌握了文化科学知识的焦庆虎，成了钢铁战线上出色的技术革新能手。今年9月，党委号召职工突破落后关键，保证实现产钢跃进计划。当时第二炼钢厂铸锭车间的落后关键是盛钢筒流出的钢水往往对不准钢锭模管口，经常有溢钢事故，并且影响出钢。焦庆虎开始考虑消灭这个事故。一天，厂长问机修工段的工人：“你们能不能解决这个问题？”正在思考问题的焦庆虎猛地站起来，响亮地回答：“行！”散会后，他躺在床上想：如果铸钢架能够动，那就可以自由控制钢筒。但一个钢筒重达七十五吨，要移动它很困难。他想了很久，终于计上心来：运用物理上的滑轮原理，在铸钢支架上安装一套可以滑动的装置。他连夜绘制出一张图表，写出计划，第二天又征求工人的意见，共同制定出技术改进方案。这个方案受到了车间主任的支持，焦庆虎立即和全段工人大战三天，在10月18日装配成功。从此，七十五吨的钢筒被驯服了，跑钢的事故消灭了。
    不久前，焦庆虎到平炉车间工作时，听到工人们说三槽出钢的分钢舵的拉杆设计有问题，绊手绊脚，妨碍工人操作，并且会造成溢钢事故，平炉三槽出钢用来控制钢水的分钢舵拉杆，原来是工程技术人员设计安装的。焦庆虎到现场观察后，发现在不到二公尺宽五公尺长的平台上，安上四个拉杆，又要六个人在高温下操作，用力很难平衡，怎能不溢钢，怎能不妨碍工人操作呢？于是，他决定改进这项技术设计。他运用杠杆原理和生产经验，做出了一套新的技术设置。当时遭到一些工程技术人员的反对。但焦庆虎坚持自己的设计装置，在领导上和工人们的支持下进行了试验。试验证明，新设计的装置要比原来的好得多，取掉了平台上的四根拉杆，只要一个人用机器操作，既减轻工人劳动强度，又减少了工人，同时避免了溢钢事故。
    现在，焦庆虎是太原钢铁公司有名的“多面手”，掌握钳工、刨工、铆工、氧焊、锻工、开铲车等九种技术。他激动地说：是共产党把我培养成一个有文化的工人。（附图片）
