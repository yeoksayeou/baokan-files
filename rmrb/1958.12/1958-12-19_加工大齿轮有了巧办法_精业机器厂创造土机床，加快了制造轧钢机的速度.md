Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 17th: Workers at the Shanghai Jingye Machinery Factory have created a good method in their rush to manufacture rolling mill equipment. They use only very simple, indigenous milling machines to process "herringbone" gears with diameters of more than two meters, solving a key problem with universal significance in the mechanical processing of rolling mills, greatly accelerating the speed of manufacturing rolling mills. Originally, it took this factory half a year to complete the task of processing rolling mill gears, but now it only takes one month to complete everything. In early December, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Machinery held an on-site meeting at the Jingye Machinery Factory and decided to quickly promote this experience so that gear processing could keep pace with the manufacturing of complete sets of rolling mills.

The Jingye Machinery Factory undertook the task of milling teeth for seven sets of rolling mills in December this year. The gears for this type of rolling mill have a diameter of two meters and each weighs twelve tons. Using the factory's only 160-inch large hobbing machine, it takes ten days and ten nights to process each gear; at this rate, it would take half a year to process all the gears. The usual "ants gnawing at bones" method is that the "ants" move while the "bones" can remain still; but when processing "herringbone" gears, the milling cutter must rotate, and the gear must also rotate. Therefore, great difficulties were initially encountered. The factory leadership mobilized the workers to create indigenous machine tools to tackle this key problem. After joint research by young worker Wang Jianhong and workshop workers, they came up with a good method: using a gearbox as a machine tool frame, placing the gear in the gearbox, erecting a gantry frame on the gearbox as a milling frame, and then equipping the milling frame with two milling cutters to mill the teeth. This solved the difficulties they encountered. Using this method, not only are they not limited by machine tool equipment and can process large gears of any size, but the efficiency is also 40% higher than that of the large hobbing machine, and the quality fully meets the requirements. The material consumption for manufacturing this indigenous milling machine equipment is very small, and it only took seven days from design to successful manufacture.

Large gears are components in general large and heavy machinery. The processing method created by the workers of the Shanghai Jingye Machinery Factory provides a reference for accelerating the manufacture of other large and heavy mechanical equipment in the future.

### 加工大齿轮有了巧办法  精业机器厂创造土机床，加快了制造轧钢机的速度

    加工大齿轮有了巧办法
    精业机器厂创造土机床，加快了制造轧钢机的速度
    据新华社上海17日电  上海精业机器厂职工在赶制轧钢设备中创造了一种好办法。他们只用很简单的土铣床，来加工直径在两公尺以上的“人”字大齿轮，解决了轧钢机械加工方面一个带有普遍性的关键问题，大大加快了制造轧钢机的速度。原来这个厂完成加工轧钢机齿轮的任务，需要半年时间，现在只要一个月就能全部完成。12月上旬，上海市机械局在精业机器厂召开了现场会议，决定迅速推广这一经验，使齿轮的加工与整套轧钢机的制造相适应。
    精业机器厂今年12月份承接了七套轧钢机的铣牙任务，这种轧钢机的齿轮直径达两公尺，每只重十二吨，用厂内仅有的一百六十寸大滚床铣，每只齿轮需要加工十天十夜；按这样的速度，全部齿轮需要半年时间才能加工完毕。一般“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，是“蚂蚁”动“骨头”可以不动；而加工“人”字齿轮的时候，铣刀转动齿轮也必需转动。因此，开始遇到很大困难。工厂领导方面发动职工搞土机床来攻这个关键问题。经过青年工人王建宏和车间工人一起研究，才想出了一种好方法，就是用齿轮箱作机床架子，把齿轮放在齿轮箱里，齿轮箱上搭个龙门架做铣架，铣架上再配上两把铣刀铣齿，这样就把所遇到的困难解决了。用这种方法，不仅可以不受机床设备的限制，加工任何尺寸的大齿轮，效率还比大滚床高40％，质量完全符合要求。制造这种土铣床设备，材料消耗很少，从设计到制造成功只花七天时间。
    一般大型、重型机械中都有大齿轮的部件。上海精业机器厂职工创造的这种加工方法，为今后加快制造其它大型、重型机械设备提供了借镜。
