Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th December: Party organizations at all levels in Yunnan Province, closely integrated with current production, have mobilized the masses on a large scale to collect, organize, and study the rich and colorful national folk literature materials. Recently, Wenshan County, Luxi County, and Lijiang Naxi Autonomous County have all held symposiums for national folk literature workers. The CPC Dehong Prefectural Committee issued "Instructions on Collecting Dai Ethnic Literary History Materials in the Prefecture." The Propaganda Department of the CPC Honghe Prefectural Committee issued "Preliminary Planning Opinions on National Folk Literature Work." The autonomous prefecture established a "National Folk Literature Compilation and Selection Office," and the counties established offices or work groups, with one cadre in charge of this work in each district and township. At present, in addition to publishing selections of national folk songs, more than 30,000 pieces (songs) of literary works from various ethnic groups have been collected.
    Minority ethnic cadres and the masses actively support the collection work. Some elderly people tell stories to the investigation teams, allowing the team members to record them. The Xishuangbanna investigation team compiled the purpose and significance of investigating and collecting national folk literature works into "Zanha" lyrics, distributed them to various places for "Zanha" singers to sing, and mobilized the masses. Yi farmers in Zhizha, Dayao County, traveled a long way to see the investigation team, actively singing songs, telling stories, and introducing historical situations. Elderly people in Jiepo, Luxi County, personally took the investigation team to other villages to conduct interviews.
    The investigation work is closely integrated with the central task. Wherever industrial and agricultural production is most intense, the investigation team goes deep to work there, conducting collection while mobilizing the masses to perform and sing extensively, and promoting those outstanding works that reflect the current struggle.
    Now, from the Jinsha River to the banks of the Honghe River, from the foot of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain to the banks of the Lancang River, the province-wide collection of national folk literature is developing in depth.

    云南广泛发动群众
    整理民族民间文学资料
    新华社昆明9日电  云南省各级党组织紧密结合当前生产，发动群众大规模地搜集、整理和研究丰富多彩的民族民间文学资料。最近，文山县、潞西县和丽江纳西族自治县都召开了民族民间文学工作者座谈会。中共德宏地委发出了“关于在全州搜集傣族文学史资料的指示”。中共红河地委宣传部印发了“关于民族民间文学工作的初步规划意见”，自治州成立了“民族民间文学编选办公室”，县成立了办公室或工作组，区、乡有一个干部兼管这一工作。目前，各地除刊印民族民歌选外，又搜集到了各民族文学作品三万多件（首）。
    各地少数民族干部和群众积极支持搜集工作。有些老年人给调查队讲故事，让调查队队员把故事记下来。西双版纳调查队把调查、搜集民族民间文学工作的目的、意义编成“赞哈”唱词，发到各地给“赞哈”唱起来，发动了群众。大姚县直苴的彝族农民，特地远道跑来看调查队，主动唱歌、讲故事、介绍历史情况。潞西县街坡的老年人亲自带着调查队去别的村寨采访。
    调查工作是紧密结合中心工作进行的。哪里工农业生产最紧张，调查队就深入哪里工作，他们边发动群众大演大唱，边进行搜集，边推广那些反映当前斗争的优秀作品。
    现在，从金沙江到红河岸，从玉龙山麓到澜沧江畔，全省范围的民族民间文学搜集工作正在深入发展。
