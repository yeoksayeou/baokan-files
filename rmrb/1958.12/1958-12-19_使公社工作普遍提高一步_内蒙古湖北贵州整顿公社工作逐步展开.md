    To Improve the Work of People's Communes Generally
    Inner Mongolia, Hubei, Guizhou Gradually Deploy Rectification of Commune Work
    According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, in order to rectify, consolidate, and improve the People's Communes, and to promote the current industrial and agricultural production movement, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee has formed a 10,000-person winter rural work inspection team led by Inner Mongolia Party Secretary Wang Duo and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Vice Chairman Wang Yilun. Starting December 15, the inspection team will successively depart and go deep into the People's Communes to carry out work.
    This 10,000-person winter rural work inspection team will focus on the current agricultural production campaign of large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, combined with inspections of the various welfare undertakings run by the People's Communes, such as canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly, as well as the living problems of the commune members, such as rest and heating, and the handling of livestock. Through this inspection, leaders at all levels will practically grasp ideology, production, and life. This will achieve the goal of promoting large-scale agricultural production and consolidating and improving the People's Communes.
    Before the departure of the work team directly under the Autonomous Region's organs, Inner Mongolia Party Secretary Wang Duo gave a report on the current rural work issues and the tasks of the inspection team, pointing out that the current center of rural production is water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, with water and fertilizer as the center, while vigorously carrying out winter sideline production and livestock management, running the township and commune industries well, and completing the rush delivery of grain and grain storage. To lead production well, a central link is to run the People's Communes well. Therefore, it is necessary to rectify and consolidate the People's Communes with production as the center, and through production, the problems existing in the communes can be quickly and properly resolved.
    According to the Hubei Daily, the large-scale production and living inspection of the People's Communes organized by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee began on the 16th. The various sub-teams of the 10,000-person inspection team, headed by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, have departed separately to various special districts for inspection.
    On the 14th, Comrade Wang Renzhong gave a mobilization report to nearly 300 section chiefs and above cadres from provincial-level units who participated in the inspection team. He requested all comrades participating in the large-scale inspection to conscientiously implement the instructions of the decision made by the Provincial Party Committee on the 4th of this month. Through the large-scale inspection, further consolidate the People's Communes, promote a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959, and promote a great improvement in the living and welfare work of the People's Communes.
    Comrade Wang Renzhong said that the large-scale inspection is first to see the flowers and learn from experience, to see the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, to see the many good people and good deeds in the Great Leap Forward, to learn from the vast number of cadres, and to congratulate the vast number of people.
    Comrade Wang Renzhong hoped that all comrades, after going down, should help the People's Communes solve the difficulties and problems in their work, and help the communes run the canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly well.
    Comrade Wang Renzhong said that in the large-scale inspection, it is necessary to help grassroots cadres summarize achievements, correct shortcomings, and study specific methods for further running the various undertakings of the People's Communes well; it is wrong to stand outside the movement and find fault.
    According to the Guizhou Daily, the work of consolidating and improving the People's Communes has been fully launched in various parts of Guizhou Province. Party committees at all levels in the prefectures (autonomous prefectures), cities, and counties have successively convened meetings to make urgent arrangements. The inspection teams at all levels formed to assist various places in carrying out this work, some have already arrived in the communes, and the areas with faster progress have started work by solving the current problems of the communes; in general areas, discussions and debates are also being carried out among cadres to arm their minds and conduct policy study.
    In the various counties of the Qian Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, 50% of the communes have cleared their accounts. Regarding the issue of living welfare, all counties have focused on key points, purged landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and added Party and League members. Currently, they are continuing to solve problems such as increasing vegetables and building dining halls.
    In the Tongren Special District, each county now has a secretary responsible for organizing the development of commodity production throughout the district. In a very short period of time, cash income has reached more than 21 million yuan, with an average of more than 12 yuan per person.
    The Bijie Special District has done a relatively good job in collective welfare undertakings. Nurseries and homes for the elderly have installed "heating appliances," which are very popular among the masses. Public canteens have simply solved the problem of dining halls. The principle of "large collective, small freedom" has been implemented, allowing people to bring their own side dishes, and small canteens serving the elderly have also been established.
    Six out of ten members of the county party committees of the Anshun Prefectural Party Committee are grasping the work of rectifying the communes, and the first secretaries of the county party committees are personally grasping the key points. The approach in the pilot work is: first, grasp production and summarize production; second, grasp distribution and handle specific problems in distribution; third, formulate democratic systems and examine democratic style; fourth, formulate long-term plans. Throughout the entire process, production is always grasped, and communist education is implemented.
    In order to do a good job in consolidating and improving the work of the communes, the local party committees and county party committees will help the district party committees arrange production and labor.

    使公社工作普遍提高一步
    内蒙古湖北贵州整顿公社工作逐步展开
    据内蒙古日报消息  内蒙古党委为了整顿、巩固、提高人民公社，推动当前工农业生产运动，以内蒙古党委书记王铎同志和内蒙古自治区副主席王逸伦同志为首，组成了一支万人冬季农村工作检查团。从12月15日开始，检查团陆续出发深入到人民公社进行工作。
    这支万人冬季农村工作检查团，将根据当前农业生产大搞水利、积肥运动这个中心，结合检查人民公社举办的食堂、托儿所、敬老院等各项福利事业，以及社员的休息、取暖等生活问题和牲畜的处理等问题。通过这次检查，使各级领导上切实做到抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。以达到推动农业大生产和巩固提高人民公社的目的。
    自治区直属机关工作队出发前，内蒙古党委书记王铎同志就当前农村工作问题和检查团的任务做了报告，指出当前农村生产中心是水利、积肥，以水肥为中心，同时大力进行冬季副业生产和牲畜管理工作，把乡社工业办好并突击完成运粮和粮食入库工作。而要把生产领导好，一个中心环节是把人民公社办好。因此需要以生产为中心整顿巩固人民公社，通过生产把公社存在的问题都能迅速妥善的解决。
    据湖北日报消息  湖北省委组织的对人民公社生产、生活大检查已在16日开始。以省委第一书记王任重同志为首的万人检查团各分团已分头去各专区进行检查。
    14日，王任重同志曾向省直各单位参加检查团工作的近三百名科长以上干部作了动员报告，他要求参加大检查的全体同志切实贯彻省委本月4日所作决定的指示，通过大检查，进一步巩固人民公社，促进1959年工农业生产更大跃进，促进人民公社的生活福利工作大改善。
    王任重同志说，大检查首先是看花、取经，看看大跃进的成绩，看看大跃进中的许许多多的好人好事，向广大干部学习，向广大群众贺喜。
    王任重同志希望全体同志下去以后，要帮助人民公社解决工作中的困难和问题，帮助公社办好食堂办好托儿所、敬老院。
    王任重同志说，在大检查中要帮助基层干部总结成绩、纠正缺点，研究出进一步办好人民公社各项事业的具体办法；站在运动之外，指手划脚找岔子是错误的。
    据贵州日报消息  贵州省各地巩固提高人民公社的工作，已经全面展开，各中共地（州）、市、县委都已相继召开会议作了紧急布置。为协助各地进行这一工作而组成的各级检查团，有的已经到社，工作下手较快的地区，有的已从解决公社当前问题入手进行工作；一般地区也在干部中开展鸣放辩论，武装干部思想，进行政策学习。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州各县已有50％的公社清理了账目。关于生活福利问题各县都搞了重点，清洗了地、富、反、坏分子，加派了党团员，当前正继续解决增加蔬菜和修盖饭厅等问题。
    铜仁专区每县现都有一个书记负责组织全区发展商品生产，在很短时间内，现金收入已达二千一百多万元，每人平均可得十二元多。
    毕节专区在集体福利事业方面抓得比较好，托儿所、敬老院都安了“取暖器”，很受群众欢迎。公共食堂都简单地解决了饭厅问题。并贯彻了“大集体小自由”的原则，可以自带小菜，还建立了为老人服务的小食堂。
    中共安顺地委各县县委委员中有十分之六都抓整顿公社的工作，县委第一书记都亲手抓重点。在试点工作中的做法是：一、抓生产，总结生产；二、抓分配，处理分配中的具体问题；三、制定民主制度，检查民主作风；四、订出远景规划。在整个过程中，始终抓住生产，贯彻共产主义教育。
    为把巩固提高公社的工作做好，各地委、县委都将帮助区委对生产和劳力进行安排。
