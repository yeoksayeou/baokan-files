Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th – In the first half of 1958, the various inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals put forward by the Soviet working masses increased by 50% compared with the same period in 1957, and the number adopted increased by 44%. The inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals that were adopted saved the country 4,518,000,000 rubles. This was announced by Garmashev, Chairman of the Soviet Committee for Inventions and Discoveries, in an article in the "Industrial Economic Newspaper" on the 26th.

In his article, he said that since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called for a mass movement of invention and innovation and the Soviet Union implemented the reorganization of industrial and construction management, the technological innovation, invention and creation of the Soviet working masses has been greatly developed.

Before the 20th Congress, the people put forward a total of 2,080,000 technical innovations and rationalization proposals in 1955, and more than half were adopted; in 1956, more than 2,375,000 were put forward, and more than 1,400,000 were adopted; in 1957, more than 2,500,000 were put forward, and more than 1,530,000 were adopted. In 1958, the number of submissions and adoptions increased further compared with previous years.

It is expected that by 1965, the number of inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals will double compared with 1958.

Garmashev said that currently, technological creation is not only increasing day by day in all sectors of the national economy, but is increasing every hour.

Many inventions and creations are of great significance to the further strengthening and vigorous development of the national economy. For example, Solokin, a staff member of the Institute of Metallurgy of the Ural Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, invented a thermocouple for measuring the temperature of molten steel. This instrument is 30% to 40% lighter than ordinary ones, but the workload is doubled.

Recently, the device for unmanned tractor operation invented by tractor driver Loginov has attracted the attention of all Soviet people.

He finally said that the current feature of creation and invention is that it is not only of a mass nature, but also has a certain target. Workers and technicians in many places are working hard for the automation and integrated mechanization of enterprises.

    社会主义国家的日子蒸蒸日上
    发挥群众智慧  节约国家开支
    苏联发明创造运动成就巨大
    新华社莫斯科27日电  1958年 上半年苏联劳动群众提出的各种发明创造和合理化建议比1957年同期增加了50％，采用的数量增加了44％。受到采用的发明创造和合理化建议为国家节省了四十五亿一千八百万卢布。这是苏联发明和发现事业委员会主席加尔马歇夫26日在“工业经济报”上著文宣布的。
    他在文章中说，自从苏联共产党第二十次代表大会号召全力开展创造发明和革新的群众性运动，以及苏联实行工业和建筑业管理工作的改组后，苏联劳动群众的技术革新和发明创造得到了巨大的发展。
    在第二十次代表大会以前，劳动人民在1955年提出的技术革新和合理化建议共二百零八万件，受到采用的占一半多一些；1956年提出了二百三十七万五千多件，采用了一百四十多万件；1957年提出了二百五十多万件，采用了一百五十三万多件。而在1958年提出和采用的件数都比前几年进一步增加。
    预计，到1965年创造发明和合理化建议的件数将比1958年增加一倍。
    加尔马歇夫说，目前技术创造在国民经济各部门不是与日俱增，而是每小时都在增加。
    许多创造发明对国民经济进一步强大高涨，具有重大意义，例如，苏联科学院乌拉尔分院冶金研究所工作人员索罗金发明了一种测量钢水温度的热温偶，这种仪器的重量比普通的轻30％到40％，但工作量则大一倍。
    最近，拖拉机手洛吉诺夫发明的无人操纵拖拉机的装置，已受到全体苏联人民注意。
    他最后说，目前创造发明的特点是：它不仅具有群众性，而且也有一定努力目标。许多地方的工人、技术人员都在为企业自动化和综合机械化而努力。
