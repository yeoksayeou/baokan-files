From the recent discussions in newspapers and periodicals regarding the issue of bourgeois rights, it is evident that some comrades hold a metaphysical view of the principle of "distribution according to work." Some believe it is fair and reasonable, to be implemented not only "in the past and present" but also "in the future communist society." Others believe it is "putting money in command," "not stimulating the enthusiasm for production, but stimulating the enthusiasm for fame in the court and profit in the market," and should be overthrown immediately. The latter view is held by a considerable number of people; as for the former view, although not many have publicly expressed it, many people actually agree with it. Both of these views have a correct side, but at the same time, they are both largely one-sided.

The mode of distribution of social products changes according to the nature of social production and its historical stage of development. Engels once said: "The mode of distribution depends to a great extent on the quantity of products to be distributed, and this quantity naturally changes with the progress of production and social organization, and therefore the mode of distribution should also change accordingly." (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin: "On Communist Society," p. 100) Therefore, the principle of "distribution according to work" should be examined from a developmental and dialectical perspective. From this perspective, we can see that it has both a positive and a negative side.

Distribution According to Work is Adapted to the Socialist Mode of Production

"Distribution according to work" is the principle of distribution in the primary stage of communism, that is, the socialist stage. It is opposed to the capitalist mode of distribution (where the exploiting class occupies most of the social products created by workers in the form of surplus value) and adapted to the socialist mode of production. The reason for adopting this distribution principle under socialism is that socialist society has just emerged from capitalist society and "still retains, in every respect, economic, moral and intellectual, the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges." (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin: "On Communist Society," p. 93). Social productive forces are not yet sufficiently developed, social products are not yet abundant enough, and labor has not yet become the primary need of life for all members of society. The essential differences between city and countryside, mental and physical labor, skilled and unskilled labor have not yet been eliminated. Capitalist ideologies, such as despising labor, shirking and being cunning, selfishness, harming others to benefit oneself, harming the public to benefit oneself, and not cherishing public property, still remain in people's minds. Under these conditions, the distribution of social products must take into account the differences in the quantity and quality of each worker's labor.

Therefore, under the socialist system, it is inevitable and unavoidable to distribute products "according to work," according to the quantity and quality of labor. It is a sharp weapon for the working-class state to improve labor productivity and consolidate labor discipline.

The positive significance of distribution according to work is manifested in: it can make laborers care about the results of their labor from a material point of view, actively put forward rationalization proposals or assist in improving equipment, and use their brains to change production structures and labor organization. This correctly combines the personal interests of laborers with public interests—national and collective interests—which not only improves labor productivity but also enhances the welfare of laborers. Under the distribution according to work system, skilled labor receives higher remuneration, which can encourage laborers to work hard to learn culture, learn technology, improve work methods, and constantly improve their scientific and technological level, thereby gradually narrowing and even eliminating the distance between mental and physical labor. The principle of distribution according to work can also combat the exploiting class's consciousness of not working for gain and despising labor, turning labor into a glorious, noble, and heroic thing; the better one works, the more one is respected by society. All this is conducive to developing production and consolidating and promoting the enthusiasm of the masses in building socialism.

From this, it can be seen that under the socialist system, distribution according to work is an objective necessity and a socialist economic law. It reflects the development process of the socialist economy, which does not depend on people's will. We can use its positive aspects to benefit society while using political and ideological education to limit the scope of its negative aspects that are unfavorable to socialism. But we cannot arbitrarily eliminate or create it subjectively.

With this said, it is completely correct and necessary that we have gradually implemented a wage system based on the principle of "distribution according to work" since the nationwide liberation. The mode of distribution is determined by the mode of production. This is a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, through a series of democratic reforms, the economic recovery stage, and the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, we gradually completed the socialist transformation of the national economy and established a socialist national economic system. Correspondingly, we have also undergone several reforms and gradually formulated a new distribution system—a wage system based on "distribution according to work." It can be seen that adopting this wage system is an objective and inevitable trend. In fact, this wage system has played a positive role in the rapid recovery of China's national economy and socialist construction. The "Decision of the State Council on Wage Reform" on June 16, 1956, stated: "In recent years, the government has considerably increased the wage level of workers and staff members based on the policy of gradually improving the lives of workers and staff members on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity; at the same time, it has carried out one or several wage reforms in various regions and departments, and has initially established a wage system of distribution according to work. This has played a positive role in encouraging workers and staff members to improve their professional and technical level, improve labor productivity and work efficiency, and promote the recovery and development of the national economy." ("People's Handbook" 1957, p. 560) Some comrades believe that the implementation of this wage system is "due to being attacked by bourgeois rights thinking" or "due to a lack of experience and taking detours," which is obviously inappropriate. This is observing the problem by deviating from the viewpoint of historical materialism and deviating from specific historical conditions, and is therefore incorrect.

The emergence of some workers' ideas of fame and profit and situations of competing for grades, demanding treatment, and haggling over quotas is due to several reasons: the workers' own bourgeois ideas and the corruption of bourgeois ideas in society; the lack of political command in wage reform, the vigorous destruction of capitalist ideas, and the vigorous establishment of socialist ideas; some propaganda is one-sided (only emphasizing the positive aspects of distribution according to work) and the negative aspects of "distribution according to work" itself, etc. Therefore, this situation cannot be entirely blamed on the distribution principle of "distribution according to work."

Here someone will ask: Okay, the implementation of the distribution according to work principle is inevitable and unavoidable, but wouldn't it be better to preserve the supply system originally implemented in the revolutionary base areas? This is also not based on reality and specific historical conditions. Everyone knows that the supply system was implemented in the revolutionary base areas in the past because they were blockaded by the enemy and lacked materials. After the nationwide liberation, the economic situation changed greatly, and it was impossible and unnecessary to maintain the original supply system; at the same time, it was not easy to implement a wage system for most workers and staff members and a supply system for a small number of workers and staff members nationwide. Therefore, after several evolutions, the supply system was finally abolished, which was also an objective and inevitable trend. As for the issue of implementing the supply system again today, this is because historical conditions have changed: in recent years, our industry and agriculture have made comprehensive and continuous leaps in development; agricultural production cooperatives nationwide have become people's communes; and the political consciousness of the broad masses of people has been significantly improved. If we criticize the abolition of the supply system in the past because we are now changing to a partial supply system, then we may be ridiculed by history.

The Negative Side of Distribution According to Work

Where is the negative side of the distribution according to work principle manifested? This is its essential inequality.

From the perspective of our ultimate goal of making revolution—establishing a communist society in our country where all means of production and products are publicly owned, there are no classes, no exploitation, no great disparities in living standards, and is infinitely beautiful—"distribution according to work" is not the most perfect and ideal mode of distribution. In other words, compared to communism, it is still a lower-level distribution principle. "Equal amount of product for equal amount of labor," that is, distributing products according to the quantity and quality of each worker's labor, seems fair and equal on the surface, but it is not actually fair and equal. Because the so-called fairness and equality here are calculated using the same standard—labor—but in fact, each person's specific circumstances are different, some have strong physiques and some have weak ones, some have high work abilities and some have low ones, some have heavy family burdens and some have light ones, and so on. Therefore, under "equal labor, thereby under equal conditions of enjoying social consumption products," each person actually receives differences, and there are great disparities in life. Thus, the "equal right" of distribution according to work "is an unequal right for unequal labor." (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin: "On Communist Society," p. 94). Therefore, Marx pointed out based on its content that this "equal right is still a bourgeois right in principle." Secondly, if there is no political command and no sufficient political and ideological education work when implementing this distribution system, "distribution according to work" will indeed "arouse the enthusiasm for fame in the court and profit in the market." The piece-rate wage system promoted on the basis of "distribution according to work" has produced various problems (such as workers in factories haggling over quotas, picking and choosing, ignoring product quality, disunity between new and old workers, and the impact on workers' health, etc.), which is proof. This shows that the implementation of the distribution principle of "distribution according to work" must also be under political command, and we must vigorously establish communist ideas and vigorously destroy bourgeois ideas. More importantly, in order to enlighten the communist consciousness of the masses, accelerate the growth of communist ideas, and establish a revolutionary outlook on life, we must often point out the negative aspects of the distribution according to work principle in order to constantly impact the remnants of the bourgeois rights viewpoint, rather than consolidate it.

Marx and Engels said it well, the "difference in people's minds and intelligence should not cause differences in the needs of the stomach and body," in other words, "differences in activity and labor should not cause any inequality and any privilege in possession and consumption." ("Complete Works of Marx," Vol. 3, Russian edition, p. 542) Since there are still essential inequalities under the socialist distribution according to work principle, then this mode of distribution is obviously not the most satisfactory and ideal mode of distribution. What is the fairest and most ideal distribution principle? This is distributing products according to each person's needs. This is the communist distribution principle. To enter this distribution principle, there must be a high degree of development of productive forces and a high degree of abundance of social products. The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is to prepare materially for the early realization of this distribution principle.

The supply system currently implemented by the people's communes is mainly limited to grain or food, so it cannot be said to be "each according to his needs." But it provides an appropriate form for realizing this distribution principle. Its historical significance lies precisely here. It greatly enhances the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for production, thereby greatly promoting the leap in the development of social productive forces.

Does Distribution According to Work Still Have a Positive Role at Present?

Here we encounter a question, that is, does the principle of "distribution according to work" still have a positive role at present? First, let's look at the current level of development of our social economy. Obviously, social productive forces have made a leap in development, but they are not yet highly developed; the three "differences" have not yet been eliminated; the communist consciousness of the broad masses of people has greatly improved compared to the past, but it is not yet enough, and labor has not yet become the primary need of people's lives. This determines that the distribution principle based on distribution according to work will still play a certain positive role on a nationwide scale at present. But life has already run ahead, and people's communes in various places have already implemented a semi-supply system. If we are still only satisfied with the principle of distribution according to work now, then we are lagging behind the times. In order to adapt to this situation, the distribution system should also be changed. Therefore, it is appropriate to implement a distribution system that combines a wage system of distribution according to work with a supply system with elements of each according to his needs (where the wage system is the main component and the supply system is the auxiliary component, or the supply system is the main component and the wage system is the auxiliary component, depending on the specific circumstances of each region, each department, and each unit). In the future, with the progress of socialist construction and the improvement of the communist consciousness level of the masses, the wage system component will be gradually reduced and the supply system component will be expanded in this distribution system until the principle of distribution according to needs is fully implemented. How long this process will take depends first on "the degree of economic maturity of communism" ("Complete Works of Lenin," Vol. 25, Chinese edition, p. 457), that is, it depends on the speed at which we build a socialist society and prepare conditions for the transition to communist society.

    历史地辩证地看待“按劳付酬”
    张仲实
    从最近报刊上关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论可以看出，有些同志对“按劳付酬”这个分配原则抱着形而上学的观点。有的认为它是公平合理的，不但“过去和现在要实行”，而且“将来在共产主义社会里也要实行下去”。有的认为它是“钞票挂帅”，“不是刺激了生产的积极性，而是刺激了争名于朝、争利于市的积极性”，应该立即打倒。持有后一观点的人是相当多的；至于前一种观点，虽然公开发表的不多，但是实际上是有许多人赞同的。这两种观点，不论哪一种，都有正确的一面，同时也都带有很大的片面性。
    社会产品的分配方式是依着社会生产的性质和它的历史发展阶段而转移的。恩格斯曾经说：“分配方式在很大程度上取决于所被分配的产品数量，而这种数量当然随着生产和社会组织的进步而改变，从而分配方式也应该随着改变的。”（马、恩、列、斯：“论共产主义社会”100页）因此，对“按劳付酬”的分配原则应从发展的观点，从辩证法的观点来考察。用这种观点观察，就可以看到，它本身有肯定的一面，也有否定的一面。
    按劳付酬同社会主义生产方式相适应
    “按劳付酬”是共产主义初级阶段即社会主义阶段的分配原则。它是同资本主义分配方式（剥削阶级以剩余价值的形式占有工人的劳动所创造的大部分社会产品）相对立，而同社会主义生产方式相适应的。在社会主义下所以采取这个分配原则，是因为社会主义社会刚从资本主义社会脱胎出来，“在经济、道德和智慧方面都还保留其所由脱胎出来的那个旧社会痕迹”。（马、恩、列、斯：“论共产主义社会”93页）。社会生产力还不够充分发达，社会产品还不够丰足，劳动还没有成为全体社会成员的生活的头一个需要。城市同乡村、脑力劳动同体力劳动、熟练劳动同非熟练劳动等之间的本质上的差别，还没有消除。人们的头脑里还残存着资本主义的意识形态，如轻视劳动、偷懒取巧、自私自利、损人利己、损公肥私、不爱护公共财产等落后思想。在这种条件下，社会产品的分配就必须考虑到各个劳动者的劳动在数量上和质量上的差别。
    因此，在社会主义制度之下，实行“按工作”、按劳动的数量和质量分配产品，是必然的和不可避免的。它是工人阶级国家提高劳动生产率和巩固劳动纪律的一个锐利的武器。
    按劳分配的积极的意义表现在：它可以使劳动者从物质利益上关心自己劳动的成果，主动地提出合理化建议或协助改进设备，开动脑筋改变生产结构和劳动组织等。这就把劳动者的个人利益同公共利益——国家利益和集体利益正确地结合起来，既提高了劳动生产率，又增进了劳动者的福利。在按劳分配制度之下，熟练劳动的报酬较高，这就可以鼓励劳动者努力学文化，学技术，改进工作方法，不断提高自己的科学技术水平，从而使脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的距离逐渐缩小，以至消失。按劳分配原则还可以打击不劳而获和轻视劳动的剥削阶级的意识，把劳动变成光荣、高尚、英勇的事情，谁劳动得越好，谁就越受到社会的尊敬。这一切都是有利于发展生产、巩固和发扬人民群众建设社会主义的积极性的。
    由此可知，在社会主义制度之下，按劳分配是客观的必然性，是社会主义的经济规律。它反映了不依人们的意志为转移的社会主义经济的发展过程。我们可以利用它的积极方面来为社会谋福利，同时借助于政治思想教育工作来限制它的不利于社会主义的否定方面发生作用的范围。但是不能主观上任意消灭它或创造它。
    以此说来，在全国解放后，我们逐步实行以“按劳付酬”为原则的工资制度，是完全正确的和必要的。分配方式是由生产方式决定的。这是马克思列宁主义的基本原理。在中华人民共和国成立后，经过一系列民主改革、经济恢复阶段及第一个五年计划的实施，我们逐步完成了对国民经济的社会主义改造，建立了社会主义的国民经济体系。与这相适应，也就经过多次改革，逐步制定了新的分配制度——以“按劳付酬”为基础的工资制度。可见，采取这种工资制度是客观的必然趋势。事实上这种工资制度在我国国民经济的迅速恢复和社会主义建设中起了良好的作用。1956年6月16日“国务院关于工资改革的决定”中说道：“几年来，政府根据在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工生活的方针，相当地提高了职工的工资水平；同时，按地区和部门进行过一次或者几次的工资改革，初步地建立了按劳付酬的工资制度。这对于鼓励职工提高业务技术水平、提高劳动生产率和工作效率，促进国民经济的恢复和发展，起了积极的作用。”（“人民手册”1957年，560页）有些同志认为实行这种工资制度是“由于受到了资产阶级法权思想的攻击”或者是“由于没有经验而走了弯路”，显然是不妥当的。这是离开了历史唯物主义的观点，离开了具体的历史条件来观察问题的，因而是不正确的。
    部分职工的名利思想和争级别、闹待遇、计较定额的情况是由于几方面的原因而产生的，这就是：这些职工本身的资产阶级思想和社会上资产阶级思想的腐蚀；进行工资改革时没有政治挂帅，大破资本主义思想，大立社会主义思想；某些宣传带有片面性（光强调按劳付酬的积极方面）以及“按劳付酬”本身的消极方面的作用等。因此，这种情况不能完全归罪于“按劳付酬”这个分配原则。
    这里会有人问：好吧，实行按劳分配原则是必然的和不可避免的，但是把原来革命根据地所实行的供给制保存下来，不是更好吗？这也是不从实际、不从具体的历史条件出发的。谁都知道，过去革命根据地实行供给制，是由于被敌人封锁、物资缺乏。全国解放后，经济情况大变，维持原来的供给制势不可能，也没有必要；同时，在全国范围内，大部分职工实行工资制，而一小部分职工实行供给制，也不好办。所以，也经过多次演变，最后还是取消了供给制，这也是客观的必然趋势。至于今日又提出实行供给制问题，这是由于历史条件发生了变化：年来我们的工农业有了全面的不断的飞跃发展；全国农业生产合作社已经人民公社化；广大人民群众的政治觉悟有了显著的提高。如果因今日改行部分供给制而去非难过去取消供给制，那未免要遭受历史的嘲笑了。
    按劳付酬的否定面
    按劳分配原则的否定面表现在什么地方呢？这就是它的实质上的不平等。
    从我们闹革命的最终目标——在我国建立全部生产资料和产品公有、没有阶级、没有剥削、没有生活悬殊、无限美好的共产主义社会说来，“按劳付酬”还不是最完善、最理想的分配方式。换一句话说，同共产主义比较起来，它还是一种低级的分配原则。“对等量的劳动付与等量的产品”，即按每个工作者的劳动的数量和质量来分配产品，表面看起来，好像很公平，很平等，但实际上并不公平，并不平等。因为这里的所谓公平、平等，是用同一的尺度——劳动来计算，但是事实上各人的具体情况不同，体质有强有弱，工作能力有高有低、家庭负担有重有轻等等。因此，在“同等的劳动下，从而在同等享受社会消费品存额的条件下”，各人在事实上得到的就有了差别，生活就有了悬殊。这样，按劳分配的“平等的权利，对于不同等的劳动是个不平等的权利。”（马、恩、列、斯：“论共产主义社会”94页）因此，马克思根据它的内容指出，这种“平等权利在原则上仍然是资产阶级的法权”。其次，如果在执行这一分配制度时，没有政治挂帅，没有进行充分的政治思想教育工作，“按劳付酬”确实还会“激起争名于朝、争利于市的积极性”。在“按劳付酬”的基础上推行的计件工资制，就产生了种种毛病（如在工厂里工人计较定额、挑肥拣瘦、忽视产品质量、新老工人不团结、对工人健康的影响等等），就是证明。这说明，实行“按劳付酬”的分配原则，也必须政治挂帅，必须大立共产主义思想，大破资产阶级思想。更重要的是，为了启发人民群众的共产主义觉悟，加速共产主义思想的成长以及树立不断革命的人生观，我们必须经常指出按劳分配原则的消极面，以便经常冲击资产阶级法权观点的残余，而不是巩固它。
    马克思和恩格斯说得好，人们的“头脑和智能的差别，根本不应招致胃和肉体需要方面的差别”，换句话说“活动、劳动中的差别不应招致占有和消费方面的任何不平等和任何特权。”（“马克思全集”第三卷，俄文版542页）在社会主义的按劳分配原则之下，既然还存在着实质上的不平等现象，那么，这个分配方式，显然还不是最满意最理想的分配原则。什么是最公平最理想的分配原则呢？这就是按各人的需要分配产品。这就是共产主义的分配原则。要进到这个分配原则，就要有生产力的高度发展和社会产品的高度丰足。现在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线就是为早日实现这个分配原则作物质上的准备。
    现在人民公社所实行的供给制，主要还只限于粮食或伙食，因而还不能说是“各取所需”。但它为实现这种分配原则提供了适当的形式。它的历史意义也正是在这里。它大大地提高了广大的农民群众对生产的积极性，从而它将大大地促进社会生产力的飞跃发展。
    目前按劳付酬还有没有积极作用？
    这里遇到一个问题，就是目前“按劳付酬”的原则还有没有积极的作用？先看一下目前我们社会经济的发展水平。很明显，社会生产力有了飞跃发展，但还不够高度发达；三个“差别”还没有消除；广大的人民群众的共产主义觉悟程度比较以前有了很大提高，但还不够，劳动还没有成为人们生活的头一个需要。这就决定目前在全国范围内以按劳付酬为基础的分配原则还会起一定的良好作用。但是生活已跑在前面，各地人民公社都已经实行了半供给制。如果现在还只是满足于按劳付酬的原则，那也是落后于时代了。为了适应这种形势，分配制度也应当有所改变。因此，现在实行一种按劳付酬的工资制同带有各取所需因素的供给制相结合（其中是以工资制为主供给制为辅或是以供给制为主工资制为辅，依每个地区、每个部门、每一单位的具体情况而定）的分配制度是适当的。以后随着社会主义建设的进展和人民群众的共产主义觉悟水平的提高，在这种分配制度中逐渐缩小工资制成份和扩大供给制成份，直到完全实行共产主义的按需要分配的原则为止。这个过程需要多长的时间，首先取决于“共产主义在经济上成熟的程度”（“列宁全集”第25卷，中文版457页），也就是说取决于我们建成社会主义社会和为过渡到共产主义社会准备条件的速度了。
