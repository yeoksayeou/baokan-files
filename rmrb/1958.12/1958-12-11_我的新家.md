My New Home
Agriculture Ministry Cadre sent to the countryside, Ma Ruiqi

It's very late at night, and the comrades around me are all asleep. My eyes are burning, tears wetting my handkerchief and dripping onto this smooth paper. It's strange, but whenever I think of those kind faces, tears stream down my face. It's only been five or six days since I left the home where I lived every day during my labor training, but it feels like a long time.

Living in our warm, loving family, I feel unspeakable happiness. If my shoes were even slightly torn, Auntie would quietly make me a new pair. At that time, Auntie was digging sweet potatoes during the day and doing odd jobs at night, sometimes so busy that she didn't even have time to eat. I really don't know when she made the shoes. Once, when I got sick, the whole family panicked. Grandpa looked for the medicine pot, Grandma brewed the soup for me, and my younger brother went to find hot water late at night. At that time, I made up my mind to take care of my health and not get sick again, so as not to worry the whole family.

Late at night, when I returned home after work, Grandma, afraid that I was tired and hungry, always brought me hot steamed buns and delicious soup and dishes. I was an amateur at labor, which also made the whole family worry. Grandpa told me to touch my hair with both hands when hoeing the ground to avoid getting blisters; my younger brother, seeing that my manure fork didn't have a handle, tried various ways to find a smooth and handy stick to install; my younger sister, afraid that I wouldn't sharpen the shovel well, always sharpened it very sharp for me before shoveling wheat. My warm, loving home, ah, it really makes me reluctant to leave, unforgettable. However, new work is waiting for me, and I can't just be greedy for this one home; moreover, what my family hopes for me is that I will do more things well. I had to leave this beloved home.

In order to repay my loved ones for their love, and to thank my family for their deep concern, I am willing to accept any work assigned to me by the Party after returning to the office. I will do whatever the Party needs me to do. I will be a good and obedient tool of the Party, and a good daughter in my family!

    我的新家
    农业部下放干部  马瑞奇
    夜已经很深了，周围的同志们都睡熟了，我的两眼热辣辣的，泪水濡湿了手帕，也滴落在这光洁的纸上。说也奇怪，一想起那些亲切的面孔，我的眼泪就簌簌地往下流。离开我劳动锻炼期间天天生活在那里的家才五、六天，我觉得仿佛已有很久了。
    生活在我们那温暖、亲爱的家庭，我感到有说不出的幸福。我的鞋子稍破了一点，婶就悄悄地给我作了一双新鞋。那时候婶白天挖红薯，夜晚还有零活，有时忙得连饭也顾不上吃，真不知道她是在什么时候作鞋的。有一次，我生了病，全家都慌了神。爷爷去找药壶，奶奶给我煎汤，弟弟深夜去找开水。当时，我就下定决心一定要注意身体，不再生病，以免全家担心。
    深夜，我工作完了回到家时，奶奶深怕我工作累、肚子饿，总是给我送来热腾腾的馍和可口的汤菜。在劳动上，我是外行，这又使全家不放心，爷爷告诉我锄地时双手摸摸头发，可以少打泡；弟弟看我的粪杈没有把，就想各种办法找一个光滑随手的木棍给安上；妹妹怕我磨不好铲子，在铲麦前她总是给我把铲子磨得十分锋利。我那温暖、亲爱的家呀，真是使我难舍难离，念念不忘。可是，新的工作在等着我，我不能只是贪恋这一个家；而且，我这一家人所盼望我的，也是要我做好更多的事情。我只好离开这个热恋的家了。
    为了报答亲人们对我的热爱，为了回谢家庭的深切关怀，我愿意在回到机关以后，接受党分配给我的任何工作。党需要我作什么我就作什么。当好党的驯服的工具，作一个我的家庭中的好闺女！
