Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th - Commercial and transportation departments in Guangdong Province and local Party committees are working closely together to rush the transportation of non-staple foods, solving the problem of supplying urgently needed materials to Guangzhou and other places.

Shaoguan and Gao Yao prefectures, which acted earlier, have already organized more than 100,000 and 70,000 people respectively, using various rural transportation tools such as handcarts, bicycles, and small boats to transport materials from all directions to concentration points day and night. According to statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce, more than 10,000 live pigs have been concentrated in the province's major ports, and Hainan Island has also concentrated nearly 10,000 head of cattle and 10,000 tons of fish awaiting transportation to various places.

In order to rush the transportation of non-staple foods, the Provincial Department of Commerce has dispatched four large refrigerated ships to Shabao and Hainan Island to transport more than 10,000 tons of fish and several thousand tons of beef. The Department of Commerce has also collected and repaired more than 3,000 pig cages for the shipping department to use for transporting live pigs. The Provincial Department of Shipping stipulates that all ships passing through material concentration points must give priority to loading non-staple foods such as pigs and chickens on the deck, ensuring immediate loading and transportation. The commercial and transportation departments have also jointly organized dozens of vehicles to transport live pigs to Huiyang, Gao Yao and other prefectures, and to transport eggs and duck eggs to Yangjiang and other places. Regarding sugar, a major material supplied to other places, 40,000 tons will be transported out by train recently.

This newspaper reports that after basically completing the winter cotton purchase task, Jiangxi Province is currently taking measures to accelerate the processing and transfer of cotton in order to ensure the urgent need for raw materials for the textile industry and winter cotton wadding for the market.

With the significant increase in cotton purchases, the province's ginning and short绒 production tasks this year are very heavy. Cotton processing has doubled compared to last year. Short绒 production has increased fourfold compared to last year. Of the province's original and newly built 50 processing plants, as of November 20, although they had already processed 160,000 dan of lint, this only accounted for about 20% of the amount to be processed this year. The prominent problem currently is that some commercial staff believe that cotton processing is not a major issue and can be carried out slowly and steadily, as in the past.

In order to reverse this situation and achieve rapid transportation, rapid ginning, and rapid transfer, and complete the cotton processing task on time, in addition to the decision by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to allocate 25% to 20% of the labor force to agricultural product processing and sideline production, various localities have immediately taken measures to educate cadres to recognize the current situation, attach importance to agricultural product processing, and overcome the idea of taking it slow. To solve the shortage of equipment and ensure the completion of the annual cotton processing and short絨 production tasks, various ginning mills have actively summarized and promoted various advanced experiences, fully utilized existing equipment, tapped production potential, increased output per machine per shift, and vigorously developed indigenous lathes to manufacture processing machines using local methods. Ming Shan in Boyang County, San Tang in Yugan County, and other ginning mills have all self-made indigenous lathes. Yongxiu, Pengze, and Xin Gang factories in Jiujiang County, in the case of insufficient raw materials, actively sought substitutes and manufactured small saw ginning machines, with an output of 800 jin of seed cotton per shift, which is three times the general output of roller ginning machines.

In order to solve the shortage of ginning capacity, commercial departments in various localities have resolutely implemented the mass line, actively assisted people's communes in establishing processing plants, and fully utilized the strength of folk ginning. The Gaoan County Commercial Bureau assisted people's communes in establishing five ginning plants. Cotton-producing areas have also launched a communist-style mass cooperation movement, with old cotton-producing areas supporting new cotton-producing areas. Jiujiang County organized 30 manual ginning machines to support Wan'an County, solving the difficulty of insufficient cotton processing capacity.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th - While purchasing large quantities of cotton, commercial departments in Jiangsu Province are making every effort to do a good job in cotton processing and transportation.

According to statistics up to November, the province had purchased more than 4,276,000 dan of lint, with a cumulative processing of 1,674,000 dan of lint, and transferred out more than 1,518,100 dan of new cotton. The amount of lint transferred out accounted for 90.4% of the total processed lint. In November, the province processed more than 930,000 dan of lint, an increase of 69.1% compared to the highest monthly processing volume last year. During November, an average of 30,000 dan of lint were transported to spinning mills every day, fully meeting the round-the-clock production needs of more than 30 spinning mills in 17 cities and counties in the province. In addition, 500,000 dan of cotton were transferred to supply various textile factories in Shanghai. It can be said that "processing catches up with purchasing, transportation connects with processing, one link is connected to another, and they are sent to the yarn factories in a continuous stream."

The main methods of cotton processing and transportation in Jiangsu Province are: in terms of purchasing, implementing simultaneous purchasing, transportation, and warehousing, utilizing production gaps to transport cotton from the producing areas to purchasing stations or processing plants in one step, as much as possible, reducing the number of transshipment links. In terms of processing, mobilizing the staff of processing plants to carry out technological innovations and continuously improve the output per machine per shift. Processing plants in various localities carried out inter-factory red flag competitions focusing on increasing the output per machine per shift, which increased the output of roller gins from an average of 149 jin last year to about 250 jin, and the output of saw gins jumped from 1,400 jin last year to 3,300 jin, so the ginning capacity increased month by month. In terms of transportation, close contact was maintained with the transportation department from top to bottom. The Provincial Department of Commerce sent the "Purchase, Sales, Transfer, and Storage Statistics Table" to the Department of Transportation every day, and the Department of Transportation allocated ships according to the amount of inventory in various localities, or used vehicles and ships to carry cotton when returning empty. The commercial departments of the prefectures and counties grasped the specific situation of transportation and connected their allocation plans with the transportation plans of the transportation department. For example, the seven fleets of Yancheng Prefecture transported 60,000 dan of lint to Jiangnan every time they went to Jiangnan to transport ore.

    广东省突击运输副食品  江西江苏及时调运棉花
    据新华社广州4日电  广东省商业、交通运输部门和各地党委密切协作，突击运输副食品，解决广州市和外地急需物资的供应问题。
    行动较早的韶关和高要专区已经分别组织十多万人和七万多人，出动手推车、自行车、小艇等各种农村运输工具，日夜将物资从四面八方运到集中地点。据广东省商业厅统计，目前已集中到省内各主要港口的生猪已有一万多头，海南岛也集中了近万头牛和一万吨鱼待运各地。
    为了把副食品突击运输出去，省商业厅已经派出四艘大冷藏船，赶往沙扒和海南岛，运出一万多吨鱼和几千吨牛肉。商业厅还收集和修补了三千多个猪笼，供航运部门装运生猪用。省航运厅规定，凡经过物资集中点的船只，必须在甲板上优先装运猪、鸡等副食品，做到随装随运。商业和交通部门并合力组织好几十部汽车，到惠阳、高要等专区装运生猪，去阳江等地装运鸡鸭蛋类。供应外地的主要物资食糖，最近将有四万吨通过火车输送出去。
    本报讯  江西省在基本完成棉花冬购任务以后，目前正在采取措施加快棉花加工调运工作，以保证纺织工业原料和市场冬季絮棉供应的迫切需要。
    随着棉花收购量的大大增长，今年全省的轧花和短绒生产任务都很繁重。在棉花加工方面比去年增加一倍。短绒生产比去年增加四倍。全省原有及新建的五十个加工厂，截至11月20日止，虽然已经加工皮棉十六万担，但只占今年需要加工的20％左右。目前存在的突出问题是：有些商业职工认为棉花加工问题不大，可以像过去那样细水长流，常年慢慢加工。
    为了扭转这种情况，做到快运、快轧、快调，按时全部完成棉花加工任务，除中共江西省委决定以25％到20％的劳动力进行农产品加工和副业生产外，各地立即采取措施，教育干部认清当前情况，重视农产品加工，克服慢慢来思想。为解决设备不足，保证全年棉花加工和短绒生产任务的完成，各轧花厂纷纷总结推广各种先进经验，充分利用现有设备，挖掘生产潜力，提高台时产量，并大搞土车床，用土法制造加工机器。波阳县鸣山、余干县三塘等轧花厂都自制成了土车床；永修、彭泽、九江县新港等厂，在原材料不足的情况下，积极找代用品，制成小型锯轧花机，台时产量达八百斤籽棉，比皮辊轧花机一般产量增加三倍。
    为了解决轧花能力的不足，各地商业部门坚决贯彻了群众路线的方针，积极协助了人民公社建立加工厂，充分利用了民间轧花力量，高安县商业局协助人民公社建立了五个轧花厂。各产棉区并开展了共产主义大协作，老棉区支援新棉区，九江县组织了人力轧花机三十部支援万安县，解决了棉花加工力量不足的困难。
    据新华社南京4日电  江苏省商业部门在大量收购棉花的同时，多方设法做好棉花加工和调运工作。
    根据到11月为止的统计，全省已收购皮棉四百二十七万六千多担，累计加工皮棉一百六十七万四千担，调出新棉一百五十一万八千一百多担，外调的皮棉占已加工皮棉总数的90.4％。11月份全省加工皮棉九十三万担以上，比去年最高月加工量增加69.1％。11月份内，平均每天运往纱厂皮棉三万担，充分满足了省内十七个市、县的三十多个纱厂日夜生产的需要，另外还调运了五十万担棉花供应上海各纺织厂。可以说做到了“加工赶收购，调运接加工，一环套一环，源源送纱厂”。
    江苏省棉花加工和调运工作的主要做法是：在收购方面，实行边收边运边入库，分期分批地利用生产空隙把棉花从产地一步运到收购站或加工厂，尽量减少中转环节。在加工方面，发动加工厂的职工进行技术革新，不断地提高台时产量。各地加工厂开展以提高台时产量为重点的厂际红旗竞赛，使皮辊机的台时产量由去年平均一百四十九斤提高到二百五十斤左右，锯齿机由去年的一千四百斤跃进到三千三百斤，轧花能力因此月月上升。在调运方面，由上到下与交通部门密切联系，省商业厅每天将“购销调存统计表”送给交通厅，交通厅就根据各地库存的多少，调配船只，或利用车船回空时载运。专区与县的商业部门，掌握交通运输的具体情况，把自己的调拨计划与交通部门的运输计划衔接起来。例如盐城专区七个船队，每次到江南去运矿石，就顺便带六万担皮棉到江南。
