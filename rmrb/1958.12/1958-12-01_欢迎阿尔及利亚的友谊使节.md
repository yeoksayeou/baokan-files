Welcoming Algerian Envoys of Friendship

The Algerian Provisional Government delegation, invited by our government to visit China, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today. This is the first delegation sent to China by the Algerian Provisional Government since its establishment. The Algerian people are currently engaged in an unyielding struggle for their country's independence and freedom. The Chinese people extend a warm welcome and pay high respect to the envoys of friendship from this heroic nation.

The Algerian people are a freedom-loving and heroic people. Since the French colonialists invaded Algeria in 1830, the raging flames of the Algerian people's resistance against the invaders have never ceased to burn. In order to win national independence and freedom, the Algerian people have fought bravely and persistently, creating countless inspiring deeds. One uprising after another has shaken the decadent rule of French imperialism. In particular, the armed uprising launched by the Algerian people on November 1, 1954, rang the death knell for French colonialism, and powerfully demonstrated the great strength and firm will of the Algerian people in their struggle for national independence. Despite the fact that French colonialists sent hundreds of thousands of troops to carry out frenzied suppression and massacres against the Algerian people, and despite the various serious difficulties encountered by the Algerian people, all of this not only failed to overwhelm the Algerian people, but instead strengthened and expanded the Algerian people's strength to resist colonial aggression. In the past four years, the Algerian people's armed forces have grown from several thousand to a fighting force of more than 130,000, controlling three-quarters of the territory of Algeria. On September 19 this year, the Algerian Provisional Government was proclaimed. This is a great victory for the Algerian people's anti-colonialist struggle, and it marks a new stage in the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation.

The heroic struggle and victory of the Algerian people prove that all oppressed nations, as long as they dare to rise up and fight, are invincible. French imperialism is extremely vicious, attempting to use airplanes, cannons, and modern weapons to save the declining fate of its colonial empire, but the result is always lifting a stone only to drop it on its own feet. France has been dragged into a quagmire in years of colonial war. French military spending has been increasing year by year, and this year it has exceeded 1,550 billion francs, bringing its finances to the brink of bankruptcy. At the same time, the French political situation has been unstable for a long time, and it has changed its cabinet twenty-six times since the end of World War II. De Gaulle's rise to power not long ago was merely a last-ditch struggle of French imperialism in a deep political and economic crisis. The De Gaulle government wants to use military intimidation and political deception to attack and divide the national revolutionary forces of the Algerian people. But the heroic Algerian people cannot be intimidated or deceived. They respond to the colonial aggressors with more resolute and powerful counterattacks.

In today's world, what is powerful is no longer any imperialist force, but the forces of socialism and national revolution. Although imperialism is still very rampant on the surface, deploying troops and showing off its power everywhere, it is actually just a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality. The victorious development of the national independence movements in the Middle East and Africa most eloquently proves this truth. The war of aggression against Egypt launched by British and French imperialism, and the subversive activities of U.S. imperialism against Syria, all ended in the shameful defeat of the aggressors. In particular, the U.S. and British imperialism attempted to sabotage the revolution in Iraq and further strangle the national independence movements of the entire Middle East Arab countries through armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan. This arrogant plan was finally declared bankrupt under the pressure of the Arab people and the people of the world. The entire international situation is very favorable to the struggle of all oppressed people for independence and freedom. As long as the people of these countries unite under the banner of anti-colonialism and continue to fight the aggressors, they will surely win. The day when the people of the world completely eliminate colonialism is not far away.

The Chinese people have deep sympathy for the Algerian people's struggle for national independence and admire the Algerian people's spirit of hard struggle under extremely difficult conditions. Although China and the Arab countries are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, they have had exchanges in history. This connection has only been artificially severed by imperialism in recent years. Now, on the common front against imperialism and for peace, the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the Arab countries has been newly developed. The Chinese people stand completely with the Algerian people who are fighting for independence and freedom, and are delighted and encouraged by every victory achieved by the Algerian people. The Chinese government clearly expressed its support for the just struggle of the Algerian people at the Bandung Conference. On the "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" held on March 30 this year, the Chinese people, together with peace-loving people around the world, sternly condemned the colonialists' crimes of aggression in Algeria, and expressed our full support for the Algerian people. We believe that the visit of the Algerian Provisional Government delegation to China this time will greatly enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of our two countries. At the same time, we believe that victory will surely belong to the Algerian people who fight to the end for national independence and freedom.

### 欢迎阿尔及利亚的友谊使节

    欢迎阿尔及利亚的友谊使节
    应我国政府邀请来我国访问的阿尔及利亚临时政府访华代表团，定于今天到达北京。这是阿尔及利亚临时政府成立后派遣到中国来的第一个代表团。阿尔及利亚人民目前正在为祖国的独立自由进行着不屈不挠的斗争。对于来自这个英雄国家的友谊使节，中国人民表示热烈的欢迎，并致以崇高的敬意。
    阿尔及利亚人民是热爱自由的英勇的人民。自从法国殖民者1830年侵入阿尔及利亚以来，阿尔及利亚人民反抗侵略者的熊熊烈火始终在燃烧着。阿尔及利亚人民为了争取民族的独立和自由，奋不顾身，坚持斗争，造成了无数可泣可歌的事迹。一次接连一次的起义，震撼了法国帝国主义的腐朽统治。特别是阿尔及利亚人民在1954年11月1日开始的武装起义，给法国殖民主义敲响了丧钟，并且有力地显示了阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的伟大力量和坚定意志。尽管法国殖民者派遣了几十万大军对阿尔及利亚人民进行疯狂的镇压和屠杀，尽管阿尔及利亚人民遇到了各种各样的严重困难，但是这一切不但不能压倒阿尔及利亚人民，反而使阿尔及利亚人民反抗殖民侵略的力量更加坚强，更加壮大了。四年来，阿尔及利亚人民武装队伍已经从几千人发展成为一支拥有十三万人以上的战斗部队，控制了阿尔及利亚全境的四分之三的土地。今年9月19日，阿尔及利亚临时政府宣告成立了。这是阿尔及利亚人民反殖民主义斗争的伟大胜利，它标志着阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争已进入了一个新的阶段。
    阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争及其胜利证明了：一切被压迫的民族，只要敢于起来进行斗争，他们就是不可战胜的。法帝国主义穷凶极恶，企图凭借飞机、大炮和现代武器来挽救殖民帝国的没落命运，但是结果总是搬起了石头砸自己的脚。法国在连年累月的殖民战争中被拖进了泥坑。法国军事费用不断增加，今年已经超过了一万五千五百亿法郎，使它的财政濒于破产。同时，法国政局长期动荡不定，从第二次世界大战结束到现在，已更换了二十六次内阁。不久以前戴高乐的上台，不过是法帝国主义在深重的政治和经济危机中所进行的垂死挣扎而已。戴高乐政府想用军事威吓和政治诱骗的办法，来打击和分化阿尔及利亚人民的民族革命力量。但是英勇的阿尔及利亚人民是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。他们以更坚决更有力的反击来答复殖民侵略者。
    在今天的世界上，强大的已经不是任何帝国主义力量，而是社会主义和民族革命的力量。尽管帝国主义表面上还十分猖狂，到处调兵遣将，耀武扬威，它实际上不过是外强中干的纸老虎。中东和非洲民族独立运动的胜利发展最雄辩地证明了这个真理。英法帝国主义发动的侵略埃及的战争，美帝国主义对叙利亚的颠复活动，都是以侵略者的可耻失败而告终。特别是美英帝国主义企图通过对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉，来破坏伊拉克的革命，进一步扼杀整个中东阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动，这个狂妄的计划也终于在阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的压力下宣告破产。整个国际局势，对于一切受压迫人民争取独立自由的斗争十分有利，只要这些国家的人民在反殖民主义的旗帜下团结起来，同侵略者再接再厉地进行斗争，他们就一定能够胜利。全世界人民彻底消灭殖民主义的日子已经不远了。
    中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争，抱着深切的同情，对阿尔及利亚人民在极端困难的条件下艰苦奋斗的精神，感到十分钦佩。中国和阿拉伯各国虽然隔着千山万水，历史上却早有来往，这种联系只是近年来被帝国主义人为地隔断了。现在，在反对帝国主义和争取和平的共同战线上，中国人民同阿拉伯各国人民之间的友谊得到了新的发展。中国人民同正在争取独立自由的阿尔及利亚人民完全站在一起，并且为阿尔及利亚人民所获得的每一个胜利而欢欣鼓舞。中国政府在万隆会议上就明确地表示支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。在今年3月30日举行的“声援阿尔及利亚日”，中国人民更和世界爱好和平的人民一道，严厉地谴责了殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚的侵略罪行，表示了我们对阿尔及利亚人民的全力支持。我们相信，阿尔及利亚临时政府访华代表团这次访问我国，将会大大增进我们两国人民的互相了解和友谊。同时，我们相信，胜利一定属于为民族独立和自由而斗争到底的阿尔及利亚人民。
