Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 13th: Party organizations at all levels in Zhejiang Province are paying attention to strengthening Party building work during the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the people's commune movement. By the end of November, the province had admitted more than 46,000 activists into the Party.

　　These newly admitted Party members have generally been tempered and tested through previous political movements, have a firm stance, are full of drive, have a certain degree of communist consciousness, and are all model figures and advanced workers on various fronts. Among the 79 new Party members admitted by the Xiaofeng County Suburban People's Commune in October, there were 18 labor models, 38 advanced workers and advanced producers, and 23 outstanding commune members. The 27 new Party members admitted by the Shiha People's Commune in Lin'an County in October were all activists who had received one to five awards during the Great Leap Forward.

　　After joining the Party, these new Party members have always stood at the forefront of various fronts and excellently completed the tasks assigned by the Party, thus more powerfully guaranteeing the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. After the Heping People's Commune in Dongyang County admitted 82 new Party members on the steel construction site, the appearance of the steel construction site underwent significant changes. The central furnace group, whose work had always been backward, increased its daily pig iron production from more than 230 jin to more than 2,000 jin under the leadership and influence of the 30 new Party members.

　　In order to actively and prudently do a good job in admitting new Party members in the future, various places have recently held meetings of the heads of the Organization Departments of the county and municipal Party committees and meetings of the secretaries of the Party committees of the people's communes to conduct specific research and deployment. Many prefectural and county Party committees have also organized inspection teams to go to the grassroots to conduct inspections and provide specific assistance in the work of admitting new Party members. The management and education of new Party members have also been strengthened by Party committees in various places.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 13th: The Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, are systematically absorbing outstanding elements emerging from the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production into the Party, further strengthening the Party's ranks. At present, more than 4,800 outstanding elements have been absorbed into the Party on various fronts throughout the county, including more than 2,000 women.

　　More than 70,000 activists who are active in production, consistently and conscientiously implement the Party's policies and guidelines, and have a certain political consciousness have emerged in Shouzhang County during the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. Party organizations at all levels throughout the county pay great attention to the training and education of these activists, and every once in a while, they are absorbed to participate in Party meetings, where they are given communist education and education on the standards of Party members, and they are also explained the current situation and the Party's guidelines and policies. They are also frequently helped to analyze their thoughts, so that they can clarify their goals. As a result, each grassroots Party organization knows which activists already meet the requirements for Party membership and which ones still need to be trained. Then, combined with the various production segments and central tasks, those outstanding elements who have received good reviews from the masses and already meet the requirements for Party membership are absorbed into the Party through the procedures stipulated in the Party Constitution.

　　These new Party members are outstanding elements in various production and political movements. They are generally able to overcome various difficulties and complete the tasks assigned by the Party. For example, the five hundred new Party members admitted by the Party Committee of the Guanmenkou People's Commune are all outstanding elements who have made greater contributions to production. Shi Jinkui, the director of the Satellite Company of this commune, thought of ways day and night to ensure that the commune members ate well, and now he has achieved the ability to provide commune members with different meals every month. Li Yucheng, Shi Jinkui's wife, has been actively working hard and has achieved high yields of soybeans and sweet potatoes. Moreover, they have a good ideological style and can closely connect with the masses, and have joined the Party this autumn. Li Fuqin, a new female Party member of the Zhangqiu People's Commune, insisted on digging wells in the severe cold weather until the task was completed in order to achieve a great agricultural harvest. During this year's autumn planting, she worked first and rested later, leading her production team to complete 120 mu of autumn planting six days ahead of schedule. After joining the Party, she immediately proposed a friendship competition of "better ideology, better production, better study and recreation, and better implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies" to female commune members such as Wang Yulan. Under her initiative, a craze for learning from and catching up with the advanced quickly swept the entire commune.

　　The admission of a large number of outstanding elements into the Party has also further expanded the ranks of activists. After a group of outstanding elements joined the Party, the number of activists in the Second Battalion of the Dayu Chen People's Commune increased from more than 150 to more than 300. These activists all regard the new Party members as their role models, hoping to withstand the Party's test on various fronts, make greater contributions to the cause of socialism, and strive to join the Communist Party as soon as possible.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, December 13th: Since the Great Leap Forward this year, the Party organization of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Xiamen Front has absorbed 360 outstanding commanders and fighters into the Communist Party of China.

　　These commanders and fighters who have been approved as probationary members of the Communist Party of China are all advanced elements who have been examined and educated by the Party for a long time and have a high degree of communist consciousness. They have played an exemplary leading role in combat, training, and various tasks, and have been awarded meritorious service. Cai Yiquan, the deputy squad leader of a certain artillery unit, is excellent in everything he does at ordinary times. In every artillery battle, he is calm and brave, and hits accurately and hard. Once, an enemy shell hit the artillery position. At a critical moment, he stepped forward, picked up the shell that was about to explode, and threw it out, ensuring the safety of all the personnel and artillery in the squad, and was awarded the Second Class Merit. Yu Nengxiang, the leader of the wireless telephone squad, is not only a telephone soldier but also an all-around gunner. In combat, he excellently completed his own task, and often led the whole squad to assist the artillery squad in carrying ammunition, and assisted the wire telephone squad in checking and connecting lines at the risk of artillery fire to ensure that the lines were unblocked.

　　Among the probationary Party members are a group of new soldiers who joined the army this year. Before joining the army, they were all outstanding members of agricultural cooperatives, and after joining the army, they became excellent soldiers. Chen Boshu was rated as a "Five-Good Soldier" shortly after joining the army, and his military, political, cultural, and physical training were all excellent, and he received three awards. In the artillery battle, he was resourceful and brave. Once, when the squad leader was not present, he commanded the entire squad to complete the combat mission excellently. Among the new soldiers who joined the Party, there were also some who inherited the heroic and tenacious tradition of the People's Army, and continued to fight even with minor injuries or insisted on fighting with serious injuries.

　　Now, the Party Committee of this unit has listed the development of Party members and the improvement of the level of Party members as one of the criteria for creating "Outstanding Party Branches," and the subordinate Party organizations have strengthened the regular education and examination of probationary Party members and officers and soldiers preparing to join the Party, conducted basic Party knowledge education in combination with the central tasks, and continuously improved their communist consciousness.

    党在大跃进中不断吸收新血液
    千万新人宣誓入党
    新华社杭州13日电  浙江省各级党组织注意在工农业大跃进和人民公社化运动中加强建党工作，到11月底，全省已接收了四万六千多名积极分子入党。
    这些新接收的党员，一般都经过历次政治运动的锻炼和考验，立场坚定，干劲十足，具有一定的共产主义觉悟，而且都是各个战线上的模范人物和先进工作者。孝丰县城郊人民公社10月份接收的七十九名新党员中，有劳动模范十八人，先进工作者和先进生产者三十八人，优秀社员二十三人。临安县石蛤人民公社10月份接收的二十七名新党员，都是在大跃进中受到一次至五次奖励的积极分子。
    这些新党员入党以后，始终站在各个战线的前列，出色地完成了党所分配的任务，因而更有力地保证了工农业生产的跃进。东阳县和平人民公社在钢铁工地上接收了八十二名新党员以后，钢铁工地的面貌有了显著改变，工作一向落后的中心炉群，在三十名新党员的带头和影响下，生铁日产量由二百三十多斤跃进到二千多斤。
    为了积极慎重地做好今后接收新党员的工作，各地最近都先后召开了县、市委的组织部长会议和人民公社党委书记会议，具体地作了研究和部署。不少地、县委还组织了检查组，到基层去进行检查，并具体帮助进行接收新党员的工作。各地党委对新党员的管理教育工作也已经加强。
    新华社济南13日电  山东省寿张县的各级中共党组织，有计划地把在工农业生产大跃进中涌现出来的优秀分子吸收入党，进一步壮大了党的队伍。目前全县各个战线上已经吸收了四千八百多名优秀分子入党，其中妇女有二千多名。
    寿张县在工农业生产大跃进中涌现出生产积极、一贯认真执行党的政策、方针，有一定政治觉悟的积极分子七万多人。全县各级党组织非常注意对这些积极分子的培养和教育工作，每隔一定时期吸收这些积极分子参加一次党的会议，向他们进行共产主义教育和党员标准的教育，并且对他们讲解目前形势和党的方针、政策。还经常地帮助他们分析思想，使他们明确自己的奋斗目标。这样做的结果，各个基层党组织对哪些积极分子已经具备入党条件，哪些人还需要进行培养，都能心中有数。然后结合各个生产段落、中心任务，把那些得到群众好评、已经具备入党条件的优秀分子，经过党章规定的手续吸收到党内来。
    这些新党员在各项生产和政治运动中都是优秀的分子。他们一般能够克服各种困难，完成党所交给的任务。例如关门口人民公社党委吸收入党的五百名新党员，都是在生产上有较大贡献的优秀分子。这个公社卫星连的生活主任石金奎，为了让社员吃得好，日夜想办法，现在已做到能在一个月内使社员不吃重样的饭菜。石金奎的爱人李玉臣由于平时积极努力，种的大豆和甘薯都获得高额丰产，而且他们思想作风好，能够密切联系群众，已经分别在今秋入党。张秋人民公社的妇女新党员李福勤，为了使农业大丰收，曾在严寒的天气中坚持打井，直到完成任务。今年秋种时，她工作在前、休息在后，带动她所在的生产队提前六天完成了一百二十亩秋种任务。她入党后，立即向女社员王玉兰等提出了“比思想好、生产好、学习文娱好、执行党的方针政策和路线好”的友谊竞赛。在她的倡议下，全社很快掀起了一个学先进、赶先进的热潮。
    大批优秀分子被吸收入党，也进一步扩大了积极分子的队伍。打渔陈人民公社二营在一批优秀分子入党后，积极分子已由一百五十多人增加到三百多人，这些积极分子都把新党员作为自己的榜样，希望能在各个战线上经受党的考验，为社会主义事业作出更大贡献，争取早日加入共产党。
    新华社福建前线13日电  厦门前线中国人民解放军某部党组织，从今年大跃进以来，吸收了三百六十名优秀的指战员，加入了中国共产党。
    这些被批准为中共预备党员的指战员，都是经过党的较长期考察和教育，具有高度共产主义觉悟的先进分子。他们在战斗、训练和各项工作中都起了模范带头作用，立过功受过奖。炮兵某部副班长蔡一泉，平时工作样样优秀，历次炮战中，沉着勇敢，打得又准又狠。有一次，敌人一发炮弹打进了炮兵阵地，在危急的时刻，他挺身而出，抱起即将爆炸的炮弹扔了出去，保证了全班人员和火炮的安全，荣立二等功。无线电话班长禹能祥不仅是个电话兵，又是全能炮手。战斗中他出色地完成了本身的任务，还常常带领全班协助炮班搬弹药，协助有线电话班冒着炮火查线、接线，保证线路畅通。
    预备党员中有一批今年入伍的新战士，他们入伍前都是优秀的农业社社员，入伍后成了优秀的士兵。陈博树入伍后不久，就被评为“五好战士”，军、政、文、体的训练门门优秀，受过三次奖励。炮战中，他机智勇敢，有一次班长不在，他指挥全班出色地完成了战斗任务。在入党的新战士中，还有一些继承了人民军队英勇顽强的传统，战斗中轻伤不下火线，带重伤坚持战斗的人。
    现在，这支部队党委把发展党员和提高党员水平列为创造“优秀党支部”的标准之一，所属党组织都加强了预备党员和准备吸收入党的官兵的平时教育和考察工作，结合中心任务进行党的基础知识教育，不断提高他们的共产主义觉悟。
