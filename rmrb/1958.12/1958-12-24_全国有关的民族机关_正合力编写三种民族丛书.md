National Ethnic Affairs Organs
	Are Jointly Compiling Three Ethnic Book Series
	Next year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In order to reflect the great achievements of the Party in ethnic work and the new outlook and new ethnic relations of the various ethnic autonomous regions, the National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China recently convened a meeting of relevant departments and decided to edit and publish three series of books on ethnic minorities as a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. These three series of books are: "General Situation of Ethnic Autonomous Regions," "A Brief History" of each ethnic group, and "A Concise Record" of each ethnic group.
	"General Situation of Ethnic Autonomous Regions" takes autonomous regions above the county level as units and is compiled by the ethnic autonomous regions themselves.
	The "Brief History" and "Concise Record" of each ethnic group are based on ethnic groups. Each ethnic minority group in the country, regardless of its population size, will write a separate book (some ethnic groups with too little relevant information can also be written into one volume).
	It is expected that these three series of books will be published successively in September 1959. (Yin Haishan)

    全国有关的民族机关
    正合力编写三种民族丛书
    明年是中华人民共和国建国十周年，为了反映党在民族工作的伟大成就和各民族自治地方的崭新面貌、新的民族关系；中华人民共和国民族事务委员会在不久以前召集有关部门开了会，确定编辑出版三种有关少数民族方面的丛书，以此作为对建国十周年的献礼。这三种丛书是：“民族自治地方概况”、各民族的“简史”和各民族的“简志”。
    “民族自治地方概况”以县以上的自治地方为单位、由各民族自治地方负责编写。
    各民族的“简史”和“简志”以民族为单位，全国每个少数民族不论其人口多少，都分别各写一本（有些民族的有关资料太少也可以合写为一册）。
    这三种丛书预计在1959年9月陆续出版。  （殷海山）
