Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 1st: The National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany unanimously adopted a statement at today's meeting, supporting the Soviet government's proposal to transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

The statement said: "West Berlin has become a breeding ground for the division of Germany, a dangerous hub for sabotage and rumor-mongering by West German and foreign intelligence agencies, and thus a dangerous source of international tension. Therefore, West Berlin must be transformed into a city of peace through demilitarization. This is the spirit of the Soviet government's proposal to normalize the situation in West Berlin."

The statement pointed out: "A peaceful solution to the Berlin issue will be an important step in preparing a peace treaty with Germany and an example of peaceful coexistence among major powers."

The statement concluded by calling on all German people to work towards the realization of this proposal.

The National Committee of the National Front held a full-day meeting today to discuss the Soviet Government's proposal.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said at the end of the discussion that the implementation of the Soviet government's proposal on the Berlin issue would pave the way for future negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis. Therefore, a peaceful solution to the Berlin issue is a turning point in the peaceful solution of the German question.

Referring to the issue of establishing a confederation of two German states, Ulbricht said that there are two steps to realizing this issue: first, to eradicate the poisonous tumor of West Berlin, and then to make the entire German body healthy again.

Lothar Bolz, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Democratic Germany, also spoke at the meeting. He said: "Our proposal expresses our firm determination to ease tensions in Germany, remove obstacles to achieving understanding between the two Germanys, and thus pave the way for a peaceful solution to the German question. The core of the German question remains the maintenance of peace. If our proposal can be realized, it will be possible to grasp the core of the problem."

He said: "It is clear that it is not Bonn, but Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, that is implementing a policy serving peace in Europe and Germany." He said that now is the time to remove this poisonous tumor and establish a clean environment in West Berlin. We have always regarded a peaceful and democratic solution as the only possible solution to the German question, and we are willing to use this method to solve the Berlin issue.

Four-fifths of the speakers at this meeting were representatives from all walks of life in West Berlin and West Germany. There were also members of the German Social Democratic Party and the German People's Union. In their speeches, they agreed with the Soviet government's proposal to resolve West Berlin and criticized the Adenauer government for following the United States' policy of atomic rearmament.

A West German newspaper editor said in his speech that the German question should be solved by the Germans themselves, and no one can solve it better than the Germans themselves. A member of the German Social Democratic Party from West Berlin said that he had never been able to express his opinions so freely in the West as he could today.

The meeting also adopted a letter to the Soviet government, expressing gratitude for the Soviet government's proposal.

    民主德国全国阵线发表声明
    号召全德人民实现苏联建议
    乌布利希指出解决柏林问题是解决德国问题转折点
    新华社柏林1日电  民主德国全国阵线全国委员会在今天的会议上一致通过一项声明，拥护苏联政府关于把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的建议。
    声明说：“西柏林已成为一个制造德国分裂的发源地，成为西德和外国特务机关进行破坏、造谣的危险枢纽，因而也成为一个制造国际紧张局势的危险泉源。因此，必须通过非军事化把西柏林变为和平城市。这就是苏联政府关于把西柏林局势正常化的建议的精神”。
    声明指出：“和平解决柏林问题的办法将是准备对德和约的重要步骤和大国之间和平共处的范例”。
    声明最后号召全德人民为实现这个建议而努力。
    全国阵线全国委员会今天整天举行会议讨论苏联政府的建议。
    德国统一社会党第一书记乌布利希在讨论结束时发言说，实现苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议将会为今后进行对德和约的谈判和实现在民主和和平的基础上重新统一德国开辟一条道路，所以和平解决柏林问题是和平解决德国问题的一个转折点。
    在谈到建立两个德国国家的邦联的问题时乌布利希说，实现这一问题有两个步骤：首先是根除西柏林这一毒瘤，然后再使德国整个身体健康起来。
    在会上发言的还有民主德国副总理兼外交部长洛塔·博尔茨。他说：“我们的建议表示我们有坚定的决心缓和德国的紧张局势、为两个德国之间取得谅解排除障碍，从而为和平解决德国问题开辟道路。德国问题的中心仍然是维护和平。如果我们的建议能够实现，就有可能抓住问题的中心。”
    他说：“很清楚，执行为欧洲和德国和平服务政策的不是波恩，而是德意志民主共和国的首都——柏林”。他说，现在正是除掉这个毒瘤和在柏林西部建立干净的环境的时候。我们一直把和平民主的解决办法作为德国问题唯一可能的解决办法，我们也愿意用这种办法，来解决柏林问题。
    在这次会议上发言的有五分之四是来自西柏林和西德各阶层的代表人物。还有德国社会民主党和德国人联合党的党员。他们在发言中同意苏联政府关于解决西柏林的建议，抨击阿登纳政府追随美国的原子备战政策。
    一位西德报纸编辑在发言中说，德国问题要德国人自己解决，任何人都没有德国人自己解决得好。一位来自西柏林的德国社会民主党的党员说，他在西方从没有像今天这样能够把自己的意见畅快地说出来。
    会议还通过一封给苏联政府的信件，对苏联政府的建议表示感谢。
