Not a Small Amount of Profit
    Liu Fan

    This year, many regions launched a "second autumn harvest" movement after the autumn harvest, and a large amount of grain, cotton, oil crops and other products left in the fields were collected. The only shortcoming is that when cleaning up the "autumn harvest battlefield," various places generally neglected a corner: many household-grown or wild small local products, such as palm fiber, reeds, *ma'ergan* (Sorghum halepense), *qinggangzi* (Cyclobalanopsis glauca) and other items, still remain on the edges of fields, corners of graves, barren slopes, and river banks. Many local commercial departments have also pointed out that the amount of small local specialties on the market this autumn has decreased significantly compared with previous years, and they are demanding a rapid change to this situation.

    In the past, harvesting these small local specialties was an important source of income for farmers' household sideline occupations. After the establishment of the communes, these products mostly belonged to the commune. However, some commune cadres did not give it the attention it deserved. They believed that these things were scattered and fragmented, just "trivial matters" with "not much profit," and not worth the effort to engage in. Therefore, when other tasks came up, they abandoned the harvesting of small local specialties.

    This idea of valuing the major and belittling the minor is obviously wrong. Originally, big and small are only relative terms. Reeds and palm fiber are naturally small compared to grain and cotton, but if all these products from all over the country are collected, it is a considerable number. The saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle," and "small things can turn big," which is exactly the point. Shunjing People's Commune in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, collected small local specialties worth 250,000 yuan in five days. Is this number small? According to the estimates of the commercial department in Neijiang Prefecture, at least more than 20 million yuan can be obtained by focusing on the harvest of small local specialties throughout the region. Why not collect these things that can be exchanged for a large amount of cash with just a little effort? Furthermore, small local specialties occupy an important position in the people's economic life, and many products are indispensable raw materials for medicine, non-staple food, and even industry. Is it not worthwhile to spend some effort to harvest them?

    It seems that it is very necessary for the people's communes in various places to make up for this lesson at the end of the autumn harvest, like Shunjing Commune, and organize the elderly, children, and women to launch a blitz for a few days, cleaning up every corner of the autumn harvest battlefield, and collecting all the small local specialties.

    油水不小
    刘范
    今年许多地区在秋收之后开展了“二次秋收”运动，大量遗漏在田野上的粮食、棉花、油料等产品都被收拾回来了。美中不足的是，各地在打扫“秋收战场”时，普遍忽略了一个角落：许许多多家生的或是野生的小土特产如棕片、芦苇、马儿杆、青杠子等物品，现今仍然留在地边、坟角、荒坡、河畔。许多地方商业部门也已经提出，今年秋后小宗土特产品的上市量比往年减少了很多，要求迅速改变这种情况。
    过去，收获这些小宗土特产品是农民家庭副业的一项重要收入。成立公社以后，这些产品大都归社所有了。但是，部分社干部对此却没有给予应有的重视。他们认为这些东西零星、分散，都是些“鸡毛蒜皮”“油水不大”，不值得花力量去搞。因此，其他任务一来，他们就把小宗土特产品的收获工作丢开不顾了。
    这种重大宗、轻小宗的思想显然是不对的。本来，大和小只是相对的说法。芦苇、棕片与粮食、棉花相比自然是小宗，但是，如果把全国各地这类产品全部收集起来，却是一个不小的数字。所谓积少成多，由小变大，正是这个道理。四川省内江县顺江人民公社在五天中收集的小宗土特产品，价值二十五万元，这个数字还算小吗？据内江专区商业部门估计，全区抓一下小宗土特产的收获，至少可取得二千多万元。为什么不把这些只费举手之劳即能换得大量现金的东西收起来呢？再说，小宗土特产品在人民经济生活中还占有重要地位，许多产品是医药、副食甚至是工业的不可缺少的原料。花一些力量去收获它们，能说不划算吗？
    看来，各地人民公社很有必要像顺江社一样，在秋收结尾时补上这一课，把老人、儿童、妇女组织起来，突击几天，把秋收战场的每个角落都打扫得干干净净，把小宗土特产品通通收回来。
