Small-Scale Integrated Iron and Steel Enterprises Have Great Potential
    Macheng and Shangcheng’s "Commune" Rolling Mill Rolls Out Round, Wire, Square, and Flat Steel and Steel Plates
    Chongqing Manufactures Simple Rolling Mill That Can Be Driven by Steam, Suitable for Promotion in Various Regions
    This newspaper reports: Can the indigenous steel produced in large quantities across the country be directly rolled into steel products? Can indigenous steel products gain wider acceptance? Judging from the various small steel products recently rolled from indigenous steel by the Fenghuangwo Iron and Steel Plant of the "May Fourth" People's Commune in Macheng County, Hubei Province, and the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant in Shangcheng County, Henan Province, the answer is affirmative.
    These two iron and steel plants, located on the northern and southern foothills of the Dabie Mountains, respectively, sent the indigenous steel smelted in low-temperature steelmaking furnaces in mid-November to their own rolling workshops, and rolled the first batch of small square steel, strip steel, flat steel, shovel plates, round steel, thin plates, steel wire, and wire nails, which have already been used in production. The steel rolled by the Fenghuangwo Iron and Steel Plant of the "May Fourth" People's Commune has been processed into cotton gin blades for cotton gins, axles for flatbed carts, screws, keys, pliers, hammers, machine parts, and seven- to thirteen-strand steel wire ropes for mountain transportation and traction. The Shangcheng No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has already begun accepting orders for steel products. When local people heard the news that the first batch of small steel products had been rolled from indigenous steel, they were overjoyed and spread the word.
    The Fenghuangwo Iron and Steel Plant of the "May Fourth" People's Commune in Macheng County and the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant in Shangcheng County are two newly established small-scale, integrated iron and steel enterprises combining indigenous and modern methods. Their iron smelting workshops are composed of local high-quality indigenous blast furnace groups, their steelmaking workshops are composed of local low-temperature steelmaking furnaces commonly used for indigenous steelmaking, and the main equipment in the rolling workshops includes: a versatile simple rolling mill named "Commune," a small wire drawing machine, and a drop hammer for forging indigenous steel ingots.
    The "May Fourth" People's Commune Iron and Steel Plant also has a manual nail-making machine. Because these two small-scale integrated iron and steel enterprises have rolling workshops, Macheng and Shangcheng have begun to fundamentally change the situation of "having steel but no materials" in the countryside since the nationwide mass campaign of indigenous steelmaking, paving the way for the widespread utilization of indigenous steel in various regions.
    The "Commune" versatile simple rolling mill was designed by the staff of the Beijing Institute of Ferrous Metallurgical Design and the Wuhan Institute of Ferrous Metallurgical Design in early November, with comprehensive reference to existing small simple rolling mills in Shanghai, Tianjin, Kaifeng, Guxian, and other places. It has many advantages: First, the structure is simple. Except for a few parts made of steel, the rest of the rolling mill is cast from iron, and small machinery factories in various regions can manufacture it. Second, the power requirement is small; a car engine is sufficient to drive the rolling mill. Third, it can roll small round steel, wire, square steel, flat steel, shovel plates, and silicon steel sheets, meeting the diverse needs of the vast rural areas for steel products. Fourth, the operation is simple; farmers who have participated in indigenous iron and steelmaking can independently operate it after learning for three or four days. Fifth, the entire rolling mill weighs only a little over one ton, and a Jiefang brand truck can transport it. The rolling workshop of the "May Fourth" People's Commune Iron and Steel Plant took only seven days from digging the foundation in the cotton field to building the factory to rolling out the first steel product. Its construction, installation, and production process broke people's long-standing mysterious views on rolling steel.
    The "Commune" versatile simple rolling mill is welcomed by various regions. Several provinces have already decided to manufacture it in batches to equip local small, indigenous iron and steel plants. Two small iron and steel plants in Luzhai, Guangxi, and Youxian, Hunan, are already installing this type of rolling mill and are about to roll out steel products. This type of small-scale, integrated iron and steel enterprise, including a rolling workshop, is a product of the development of the "small indigenous groups" iron and steelmaking movement. Its significance lies not only in finding various uses for indigenous steel, dispelling people's various doubts about indigenous steel, but also further consolidating and developing the experience of "small indigenous groups" iron and steelmaking, and will promote and advance the industrialization of the people's communes. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided to hold an on-site meeting in Macheng County, Hubei Province, in the near future to exchange and promote experience in this area, so that indigenous steel products can shine.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 4th: The Laoguang File Factory in Chongqing recently successfully manufactured a simple rolling mill with a simple structure. This rolling mill can be driven by a motor, and in places without electricity, it can also be powered by steam or other power machinery. It can roll both foreign steel and indigenous steel, making it very suitable for promotion in various regions.
    The simple rolling mill manufactured by the Laoguang File Factory weighs less than 500 kilograms, is one meter high, and 50 centimeters wide. Operated by four people, it can roll 1.5 to 2 tons of 10 mm steel per day, and 2.5 to 4 tons of 20 mm steel. The rolling mill has only more than 20 parts in total, including a pair of arches, a pair of sleeve-type rollers, two axles, and six gears. Most of the parts are made of pig iron sand casting or wrought iron forging, and do not need to be processed on machine tools. The heavily stressed gears, rollers, and other accessories only need to be processed on ordinary machine tools using ordinary cast steel parts. The base is a wooden stool, or it can be poured with cement. Factories with general simple machining equipment can manufacture it. The factory currently uses a 20-horsepower motor to drive it, but it is understood that only 10 to 15 horsepower is actually sufficient to drive it.
    The Laoguang File Factory is a small factory that was merged from several file production cooperatives only in the first half of this year. The entire factory has only more than 20 technical workers. There is not a single technician, and the entire equipment consists of only a few red furnaces, a grinder, and two file machines, without a single cutting machine tool. The workers overcame many difficulties when manufacturing this rolling mill.
    After the Laoguang File Factory successfully manufactured the rolling mill, it initially helped large factories in Chongqing to process various steel products and high-voltage copper wires. They used steel billets with a diameter of 40 mm to roll various types of small steel products for industrial and construction use ranging from 8 mm to 20 mm, including square steel, round steel, flat steel, hexagonal steel, and other products. The workers have rolled 9 tons of hexagonal steel for the Chang'an Machinery Factory and more than 10 tons of high-voltage copper wire for the Chuanjiang Electrical Machinery Factory and other units. Recently, the workers have also rolled steel products from indigenous steel stir-fried in the factory's chicken coop furnace. The method is to first forge the stir-fried steel into a billet shape, and then heat and roll it. In the past, the factory's monthly output value was only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. After starting to produce rolled steel products, it has risen to more than 100,000 yuan since October. (Attached pictures)

    小型钢铁联合企业大有可为
    麻城商城“公社号”轧钢机轧出圆、线、方、扁钢材和钢板
    重庆制成简易轧钢机可以用蒸汽带动适合各地推广
    本报讯  全国各地大量生产出来的土钢，能不能直接轧成钢材？土钢制品能不能登堂入室？从湖北麻城县“五四”人民公社凤凰窝钢铁厂和河南商城县第一钢铁厂最近用土钢轧出的多种小型钢材看来，答复是肯定的。
    这两个位于大别山南北两麓的钢铁厂，在11月中旬先后用低温炼钢炉炼出的土钢，送进自己的轧钢车间，轧成了第一批小型方钢、带钢、扁钢、锹板、圆钢、薄板、钢丝、洋钉，并且已经用于生产。“五四”人民公社凤凰窝钢铁厂轧出的钢材，已加工成了轧棉机的轧棉钢刀，板车上的车轴、螺丝钉、车键、钳子、锤子、机械零件以及七股到十三股用作山区运输滑丝化和牵引用的钢丝绳。商城第一钢铁厂已经开始接受对钢材的订货。当地人民听到土钢轧出第一批小型钢材的消息后，兴高采烈，奔走相告。
    麻城县“五四”人民公社凤凰窝钢铁厂和商城第一钢铁厂，是新近建立起来的两个小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合企业。它们的炼铁车间，都是由当地优良的土高炉群组成的，炼钢车间是由当地土法炼钢惯用的低温炼钢炉组成的，轧钢车间的主要设备包括：被命名为“公社号”的万能简易轧钢机、小型拔丝机和用来锻打土钢钢锭的落锤。
  “五四”人民公社钢铁厂还有一部手动的制钉机。因为这两个小型钢铁联合企业有了轧钢车间，这就使得麻城和商城开始从根本上改变了全民大搞土法炼钢以来，农村“有钢无材”的局面，为各地广泛利用土钢开辟了一条道路。
    “公社号”万能简易轧钢机，是北京黑色冶金设计总院和武汉黑色冶金设计院的工作人员，在11月初综合参考上海、天津、开封、故县等地现有的小型简易轧机设计出来的。它具有许多优点：一，结构简单，轧机上除个别零件用了一些钢料外，其他都用铁铸成，各地小型机器工厂都能制造。二，所需动力小，一个汽车引擎就足够带动轧机。三，能轧小型圆钢、线材、方钢、扁钢、锹板、矽钢片，适合广大农村对钢材的多种需要。四，操作简单，参加过土法炼铁、炼钢的农民，学上三、四天就能独立操作。五，全套轧机只有一吨多重，一部解放牌汽车就能搬走。“五四”人民公社钢铁厂的轧钢车间，从棉花地里挖地基、盖厂房起，到轧出第一根钢材，只用了七天时间，它的建设、安装和生产过程，打破了人们历来对轧钢方面的神秘观点。
    “公社号”万能简易轧机，受到各地的欢迎，目前已经有几个省决定成批制造，用来装备当地小的、土的钢铁厂。广西鹿寨和湖南攸县有两个小型钢铁厂，已经在安装这种轧钢机，即将轧出钢材。这种包括轧钢车间的小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合企业，是“小土群”炼铁炼钢运动发展的产物。它的意义不仅是在于给土钢找到了多种用途，打破了人们对土钢的种种疑虑，而且进一步巩固和发展了“小土群”炼铁、炼钢的经验，并将对人民公社的工业化起着促进和推动作用。冶金工业部已经决定最近在湖北麻城县召开现场会议，交流和推广这方面的经验，让土钢制品放射光彩。
    本报重庆4日电  重庆市劳光锉刀厂最近制造成功了一种结构简单的简易轧钢机。这种轧钢机可以用马达带动，没有电源的地方也可以用蒸汽或其他动力机械作动力，可以轧洋钢，也可以轧土钢，很适合各地推广。
    劳光锉刀厂制造的这部简易轧钢机共重不到五百公斤，机身高一公尺，宽五十公分。四个人操作，每天可轧制十米厘的钢材一吨半到两吨，轧二十米厘的钢材可达两吨半到四吨。轧钢机全部只有二十多个零件，其中包括一对牌坊，一对套筒式的轧辊，两根轴心，六个齿轮。绝大部分零件是用生铁翻砂或熟铁锻制的，不必上机床加工，受力大的齿轮、轧辊等配件也只需用一般的浇钢件在普通机床上就可以加工出来。机座是一个木凳，也可以用水泥浇注。一般具有简易机械加工设备的工厂都可以制造。这个厂目前是用二十马力的马达带动，据了解，实际上只十至十五马力来带动就足够了。
    劳光锉刀厂是今年上半年才由几个锉刀生产合作社合并起来的小厂。全厂只有二十多个技术工人。没有一个技术人员，全部设备只有几座红炉、一部砂轮机和两部锉刀机，没有一部切削机床。工人们在制造这部轧钢机时克服了不少困难。
    劳光锉刀厂的轧钢机制造成功后，最初帮助重庆的大厂加工各种钢材和高压铜线。他们用直径四十米厘的钢坯，先后轧成了八米厘到二十米厘的工业和建筑用各种类型的小型钢材，其中有方钢、圆钢、扁钢、六角钢等多种产品。工人们为长安机器厂已轧制成九吨六角钢，为川江电机厂等单位轧出了十多吨高压铜线。最近工人们又用厂里鸡窝炉炒出的土钢轧成了钢材。办法是先将炒钢锻打成坯形，然后再加热轧制。这个厂过去每月生产总值只有一万至二万元，在开始生产轧钢产品以后，10月份起已上升到十万元以上。（附图片）
    钢坯是自己厂里用土法锻造的，这是工人在给钢坯加热。
