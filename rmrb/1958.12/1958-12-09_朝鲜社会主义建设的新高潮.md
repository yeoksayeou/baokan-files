    A New Upsurge in Socialist Construction in Korea
    Li Zhongyu, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

    Striving to Achieve Great Tasks
    Our socialist construction has entered an unprecedented upsurge. Our working people, in order to realize the programmatic tasks of socialist construction put forward by Comrade Kim Il-sung at the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have mounted the Chollima and are advancing at full speed.

    Comrade Kim Il-sung put forward a broad prospect: in the next six or seven years, the average per capita production of major industrial products should reach: 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, 2,500 kilograms of coal, 400 kilograms of pig iron and granulated iron, 300 to 350 kilograms of steel, 150 to 200 kilograms of chemical fertilizers, 500 kilograms of cement, 50 meters of cloth, 10 kilograms of white sugar, and 100 kilograms of fish. In the next few years, the average per capita grain output should reach more than 700 kilograms.

    This is certainly a huge task. However, as long as it is the call of the Party, our workers and peasants, who have always been brave in overcoming all difficulties and striving for brilliant victories, are determined to victoriously complete this task and strive to complete it in a short period.

    Workers and peasants have unanimously expressed their intention to complete the task of producing major industrial products in four or five years and to complete the task of grain output in one or two years.

    The completion of this task will turn our country into an economically developed socialist industrial country, and will allow us to see communism appearing on the horizon, no longer just an ideal society.

    The completion of this task can also provide a strong material foundation for promoting the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    The Party has taken a series of measures to victoriously complete this programmatic task and further strengthen the revolutionary labor enthusiasm of the working people.

    The Central Committee of the Party held a plenary session in September to discuss the issue of further expanding the irrigated area of dry and paddy fields and promoting the development of the metal industry, and made resolutions. In addition, it also adopted a document calling on all party members to further launch an upsurge in socialist construction.

    The call of the Central Committee of the Party aroused a high sense of political responsibility, labor enthusiasm, and creativity among all party members and working people. All party members and working people responded to the Party's call with the great initiative of breaking old labor quotas and creating new ones. This great initiative, like a prairie fire, quickly spread to all sectors of socialist construction in our country. Now, new miracles and changes are happening almost every day. Many advanced factories and enterprises, workers and technicians are mechanizing and automating operations, improving technical and operational levels, and rationally organizing the labor force to further improve labor productivity.

    Workers and technicians are actively carrying out a collective innovation movement to increase industrial production in 1959 by more than 1.5 times that of 1958 and complete the first five-year plan one and a half to two years ahead of schedule.

    This shows that our working people have risen up to carry out a mass technical revolution. Mechanizing and automating operations, making work easier while greatly increasing labor productivity, is a requirement that has matured in the socio-economic development of our country and is a process that conforms to the laws.

    With the complete victory of socialist production relations in all sectors of our people's economy, the most fundamental task facing us is to carry out the technical transformation and technical revolution of the people's economy and carry out the cultural revolution.

    Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out: "At the present stage of socialist construction, the most fundamental task facing us is: relying on the established socialist production relations, to carry out the technical transformation of the people's economy, so as to further consolidate the material basis of socialist production and realize the cultural revolution."

    Today, the mass initiative of our working people to create new labor quotas means a great change in the technical revolution, and a profound qualitative change in our people's economy.

    Major Achievements in Industrial Construction
    After the war, our country has made epoch-making achievements in socialist construction based on the correct economic policy of the Korean Labor Party of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while developing light industry and agriculture.

    The Party's economic policy creatively applies the universal theory of Marxist-Leninism on expanded reproduction to the specific practice of our country.

    As a result of thoroughly implementing the Party's correct economic policy, the people's lives, which had been greatly reduced by the war launched by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, were stabilized and improved in a short period; the people's economy, which had been cruelly destroyed, was rapidly restored, technical transformation was also realized to a considerable extent, and a series of new industrial sectors have been created. Due to the most rational utilization of the noble assistance of the people of fraternal countries and all the resources of our country, the heavy industrial base has been rebuilt and expanded, the fuel and power base has been strengthened, and at the same time, the light industrial base has also been established. This ensures the balanced development of all sectors of the people's economy such as heavy industry, light industry and agriculture, and ensures the rational distribution of consumption and accumulation.

    In this way, during the Three-Year Plan period, the total industrial output value increased 2.9 times compared with 1953, of which the production of means of production increased 4 times and the production of consumer goods increased 2.1 times.

    In terms of industrial production, the proportion of the first category increased from 37.7% in 1953 to 53.9% in 1956.

    In the first year of the first five-year plan, namely 1957, the total industrial output value increased by 144% compared with the previous year.

    Among them, in 1957, the machinery manufacturing, metal processing industry and textile industry increased 22 times compared with 1946.

    The proportion of machinery manufacturing and metal processing industry in the total industrial output value increased from 1.6% in 1944 to 17.3% in 1956.

    This year, our country's industry can grow more than 12 times compared with 1946 after liberation.

    In the process of achieving the above-mentioned achievements, the technical and cultural level of workers and technicians has been significantly improved. Since liberation, 80,000 new types of experts and technicians have been trained.

    In the four or five years after the war, the colonial imbalance and technical backwardness of our country's industry have been overcome, which enables us to enter the stage of comprehensive technical revolution today. The rapid development of industry and the rapid growth of technical forces such as workers and technicians have promoted the creation of new industrial bases and the reconstruction of the people's economic technical equipment, and have achieved great achievements.

    Our workers and technicians used equipment and facilities produced by themselves to build their own designed blast furnaces and coking furnaces in just a few months, and used iron coke to produce pig iron and anthracite coal to produce copper. At the same time, they are mass-producing the latest type of machine tools such as S·U50 type and have begun to produce excavators, tractors and automobiles. In the past, our machinery industry was almost blank, but today it can produce many necessary equipment and machinery.

    The upsurge of socialist construction in our country is also significantly reflected in the rapid development of local industries. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party held in June this year decided to carry out a national movement to develop the food processing industry and the production of daily necessities, and for this purpose, proposed to build one or more local factories in each county. In just a few months, more than a thousand local factories have been built in various places like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

    In addition to producing various processed foods and daily necessities, these factories also produce many important industrial products such as cement, pig iron, and textiles.

    Our workers are determined to increase the production of a series of important industrial products such as pig iron, granulated iron, and steel in 1959 to more than double that of 1958, exceeding the planned level of 1961.

    Socialist Transformation and Construction of Agriculture
    The leap in production and transformation not only appeared in the industrial sector, but also widely appeared in our agricultural sector.

    Our country has completed agricultural collectivization and the socialist transformation of agriculture based on the Party's correct agricultural policy. Agricultural cooperatives have been merged from small-scale cooperatives into large-scale cooperatives, and their organizational and economic foundations have been further strengthened. Under this situation, in order to further rapidly develop our country's agriculture, the Party proposed the task of completing the water conservancy and electrification of agriculture in two or three years, and completing the mechanization of agriculture in a very short period.

    This is a great task put forward in order to greatly develop agricultural productive forces on a high technical basis and renew the face of the countryside. The realization of these tasks is of great significance for promoting the completion of socialist construction and moving towards communism.

    In our country with limited arable land, fully establishing an irrigation system and completely overcoming natural disasters to increase the yield per unit area is the decisive key to our country's agricultural technical reform. The Party and the Republic Government have actively promoted the work of expanding the irrigated area and converted most of the paddy fields into safe water conservancy fields. However, this alone cannot meet the requirements of socialist construction. Therefore, the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party proposed a plan for transforming nature: to establish an irrigation system for 700,000 chongbo of dry land in two or three years, expand the irrigated area of paddy fields by more than 300,000 chongbo, and fully irrigate all possible irrigated paddy fields and dry land. In order to realize this plan to transform nature, it is necessary to develop the electrification and mechanization of agriculture. Therefore, the Party decided to combine the construction of large power plants with the construction of various medium and small power plants such as hydropower, thermal power, and wind power in rural areas to ensure that all rural households in our country have electric lights and use electricity for irrigation and other agricultural labor in one or two years.

    The Party also plans to supply more than 30,000 tractors and 25,000 to 30,000 cars to rural areas in the near future in order to complete the mechanization of rural areas.

    The grand prospect put forward by the Party has greatly encouraged the construction enthusiasm of our people. Workers and technicians in the industrial sector actively support the Party's instructions and are carrying out a vigorous production struggle to support the mechanization of rural areas. Our peasants are also working hard to increase production in order to accelerate the realization of this prospect. They have reached more than 1.5 times the pre-war level in terms of grain this year, and have put forward the goal of reaching 1.5 to 2 times the total agricultural output value of this year in 1959.

    Basic Changes in People's Lives
    Our country has completed the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial businesses in cities and towns, and has completed agricultural cooperation in rural areas. Socialist production relations dominate both cities and towns. This situation has not only promoted the development of industry and agriculture, but has also caused basic changes in people's consciousness and lives, promoting the rapid arrival of the cultural revolution.

    Our country implemented a comprehensive primary compulsory education system in 1956. On this basis, starting from November 1 this year, we will implement the comprehensive junior high school compulsory education system originally scheduled to start in 1961. At the same time, in order to implement the technical compulsory education system, our country is actively carrying out comprehensive preparatory work. This is the main link in our country's cultural revolution.

    The Party and the Republic Government give deep concern to building cities and rural areas into cultural cities and towns. Because this is also one of the guidelines for stabilizing and improving the lives of residents. Now the faces of our cities and rural areas have been completely renewed and become cultural cities and towns. In particular, the electrification and mechanization of rural areas has further developed the cultural revolution.

    Our country has eliminated the root of human exploitation, poverty has disappeared forever in people's lives, and people's lives are becoming increasingly prosperous and happy. The national income in 1957 increased by 100% compared with 1949 before the war, and the wages of employees increased by 1.3 times during the same period. In particular, the planned growth of the actual income of the working people during the first five-year plan was originally 1.5 times, but this growth plan will be completed two years ahead of schedule in 1959.

    From the ceasefire to 1957, 16.3 million square meters of cultural housing were built in cities and rural areas, and in 1958 alone, the state invested in the construction of more than 2 million square meters of housing. During the first five-year plan period, more than 300,000 cultural housing will be built in rural areas.

    In this way, a huge change has taken place in the lives of our people. When the ceasefire was just reached, we did not have a ton of steel, a ton of cement, or a ton of chemical fertilizer, and we did not have enough to eat and wear. In such an environment, the working people of our country actively supported the wise economic policy of the Korean Labor Party and took up the first shovel to work hard and selflessly to build their motherland. However, now our country has basically solved the problem of food, clothing and housing. The task put forward by the Party is: in two or three years, the average per capita distribution of textiles will be 30 meters, meat 40 kilograms, milk 46 kilograms, and more than 150 eggs.

    The great achievements made by the Korean people are the result of the correct leadership of our Party and the selfless labor of the people who are infinitely loyal to the Party. The fact is that in the face of the unity and solidarity of the Party and the working people, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome and no fortress that cannot be broken through. The Korean Labor Party, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, pointed out in each period the most correct line and policy reflecting the objective laws of social development, and further mobilized the revolutionary strength of the masses to implement this line and policy. All party members and working people cherish the unity and solidarity of the Party like the apple of their eye. They are united around the Party like a copper wall and iron wall, responding to the Party's call, fighting bravely, and achieving victory. They responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Party's December 1956 plenary session on "maximizing production increase and economy" in order to cross the peak of the first year of the first five-year plan, actively mobilized, and launched a movement to increase production and economy. By 1958, they actively responded to the Party's successive calls and continued to accelerate the speed of socialist construction, thus bringing about an unprecedented upsurge like today. However, this victory was not achieved without any difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party, all party members and working people repelled the insidious activities of the anti-party sectarian elements that existed for a while, overcame the obstacles of conservative and passive elements, and smashed the plots of international revisionists and the conspiracies of saboteurs and assassins sent by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, and defended the fruits of socialism.

    In the past, all our party members and working people, who displayed the fearless heroic fighting spirit in the Fatherland Liberation War, are today unfolding the socialist construction of the motherland with the heroic posture of the Chollima.

    Our achievements and today's great upsurge in socialist construction are inseparable from the noble proletarian internationalist support and solidarity of the people of the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other fraternal countries. The fraternal support and solidarity given to us by fraternal countries during the war and the post-war recovery period is the main factor of our victory. Today, the Korean people feel extremely excited that we are keeping pace with the Great Leap Forward movement of the great Chinese people, helping each other, encouraging each other, and leaping forward hand in hand.

    Under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Party, the people of China and Korea will surely successfully complete the great cause of socialist and communist construction of their respective motherlands.

    朝鲜社会主义建设的新高潮
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会委员长  李钟玉
    争取实现伟大的任务
    我国社会主义建设已进入了前所未有的高潮。我国劳动人民，为了实现金日成同志在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国创建十周年纪念大会上所提出的社会主义建设的纲领性任务，已跨上了千里马，奔腾前进。
    金日成同志提出了广阔的展望：今后六、七年内，按人口平均每一个人重要工业产品生产量要达到：电力二千度，煤二千五百公斤，生铁和粒铁四百公斤，钢三百到三百五十公斤，化学肥料一百五十到二百公斤，水泥五百公斤，布匹五十公尺，白糖十公斤，鱼一百公斤，在最近几年内按人口平均每一个人的谷物产量要达到七百公斤以上。
    这当然是巨大的任务。但是，只要是党的号召，不顾一切困难而一向勇于争取辉煌胜利的我国工人和农民，都有决心胜利完成这一任务，并且争取在短期间完成。
    工人和农民们已一致表示，要在四、五年内完成重要工业产品产量任务；要在一、二年内完成谷物产量任务。
    这一任务的完成，将使我国变成经济发达的社会主义工业国，并使我们可以看见出现在地平线上的共产主义，它不再只是理想社会而已。
    这一任务的完成还可以为促进祖国的和平统一伟业，建立强有力的物质基础。
    党已经采取了一系列的措施，以胜利完成这一纲领性任务，进一步加强劳动人民的革命的劳动热情。
    在9月间举行的党中央委员会全体会议上，讨论了进一步扩大旱田和水田灌溉面积的问题和促进金属工业发展的问题，并且作出了决议，另外，还通过了号召全体党员进一步掀起社会主义建设高潮的文件。
    党中央委员会的号召，唤起了全体党员和劳动人民的高度的政治责任感、劳动热忱和创造性。全体党员和劳动人民以打破旧的劳动定额，创造新定额的伟大发起，来回答党的这一号召。这一伟大的发起，像燎原之火，迅速地燃遍我国社会主义建设的各部门。现在几乎每天发生着新的奇迹和变化。许多先进工厂企业的工人和技术人员把作业过程机械化和自动化，提高技术和操作水平，合理地组织劳动力，来进一步提高劳动生产率。
    工人和技术人员活跃地开展集体革新运动，要把1959年的工业生产提高到1958年的一点五倍以上，并提前一年半和两年完成第一个五年计划。
    这说明我国劳动人民已奋起进行群众性的技术革命。通过作业过程机械化和自动化，使工作变得更容易而劳动生产率却大大提高，这是我国社会经济发展中已经成熟了的要求，也是合乎规律的进程。
    在社会主义生产关系已在我国人民经济各部门取得了完全胜利的情况下，摆在我们面前的最基本的任务，是实行人民经济的技术改造和技术革命，实行文化革命。
    金日成同志指出：“在社会主义建设的现阶段，摆在我们面前的最基本的任务是：依靠已建立的社会主义生产关系，进行人民经济的技术改造，以进一步巩固社会主义生产的物质基础，实现文化革命。”
    今天，我国劳动人民创造新劳动定额的群众性发起，就意味着技术革命的大转变，意味着我国人民经济在质量上的深刻变化。
    工业建设的重大成就
    战后，我国根据朝鲜劳动党关于优先发展重工业同时发展轻工业和农业的正确的经济政策，在社会主义建设中，已取得了划时代的成就。
    党的这一经济政策将马克思列宁主义关于扩大再生产的普遍理论创造性地运用于我国的具体实践。
    由于彻底贯彻了党的正确的经济政策的结果，被美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮所发动的战争所大大降低了的人民生活，在短期间得到了安定和提高；被残酷地破坏了的人民经济得到了迅速恢复，技术改造也在相当范围内得以实现，一系列新的工业部门已经创建起来。由于最合理地利用兄弟国家人民的高贵援助和我国的一切富源，重工业基地得以重建和扩大，燃料和动力基地获得了加强，同时轻工业基地也建立起来了。这保证重工业、轻工业和农业等人民经济各部门能够平衡地发展，保证了消费和积累的合理分配。
    这样，在三年计划期间，工业总产值比1953年增加到二点九倍，其中生产资料的生产增加到四倍，消费品的生产增加到二点一倍。
    在工业生产方面，第一部类的比重，从1953年的37.7％增加到1956年的53.9％。
    在第一个五年计划的第一年，即1957年的工业总产值，又增加到前一年的144％。
    其中，1957年机械制造、金属加工业和纺织工业，和1946年相比，增加到二十二倍。
    机械制造和金属加工业在工业总产值中所占的比重，从1944年的1.6％，提高到1956年的17.3％。
    今年，我国工业和解放后的1946年相比，可增长到十二倍以上。
    在取得上述各项成就的过程中，工人、技术人员的技术水平和文化水平显著地提高了。解放以来，培养了八万名新型的专家和技术人员。
    战后四、五年来，我国工业的殖民地式的不平衡性和技术落后性被克服了，这使我们今天能够进入全面的技术革命阶段。工业的迅速发展和工人、技术人员等技术力量的迅速成长，促使新的工业基地的创建和人民经济技术装备的改建，获得了巨大的成就。
    我国工人和技术人员用自己生产的器材和设备，在短短几个月的期间内，就建成了自己设计的高炉和炼焦炉，并且用铁焦炼出生铁，用无烟煤炼出了铜。同时，他们大量生产着像S·U50型这样的最新式工作母机，并开始生产掘土机、拖拉机和汽车。过去我国机械工业几乎等于空白，在今天却能够生产许多必要的设备和机械了。
    我国社会主义建设的高潮，还显著地反映在地方工业的飞跃发展中。今年6月举行的党中央委员会全体会议决定开展全民性运动来发展食品加工工业和日用品生产，并为此提出要在每个郡建设一所以上地方工厂的要求。不过几个月的时间，各地方就像雨后春笋似地建成了一千多个地方工厂。
    这些工厂除了生产各种食品加工品和日用品以外，还生产不少的水泥、生铁、纺织品等重要的工业品。
    我国工人决心把1959年的生铁、粒铁、钢等一系列重要工业产品的产量，增加到1958年的二倍以上，以超过1961年的计划水平。
    农业的社会主义改造和建设
    生产的飞跃增长和转变，不仅出现在工业部门，并且也广泛地出现在我国农业部门。
    我国根据党的正确的农业政策，已经完成了农业合作化，完成了农业的社会主义改造。农业社从小规模的社合并成了大规模的社，它们的组织和经济基础进一步加强了。在这种情况下，为了进一步迅速发展我国的农业，党提出了在二、三年内完成农业的水利化和电气化，并在极短期间完成农业的机械化的任务。
    这是为了在高度的技术基础上大大发展农业生产力，使农村面貌一新而提出的伟大任务。这些任务的实现，对于促进社会主义建设的完成和向共产主义的迈进，有着重大意义。
    在耕地面积有限的我国，全面建立灌溉体系，完全克服自然灾害以提高单位面积产量，这是我国农业技术改革的决定性关键。党和共和国政府曾积极促进扩大灌溉面积的工作，把大部分水田改为水利安全田。但是仅仅这一点还不能满足社会主义建设的要求。因此，党中央委员会9月全体会议提出了大自然改造计划：在二、三年内建立七十万町步旱田灌溉体系，扩大水田灌溉面积三十万町步以上，并全部灌溉可能灌溉的所有水田和旱田。为了实现这种改造大自然的计划，有必要发展农业的电气化和机械化，于是，党又决定把大发电厂的建设和农村的水力、火力、风力等各种中、小发电厂的建设配合起来，保证在一、二年内，使我国全体农村每家农户都有电灯，灌溉和其他农业劳动都利用电力。
    党还计划在最近将来为了完成农村机械化，将供给农村三万台以上拖拉机和二万五千辆到三万辆汽车。
    党所提出的这个远大的前景，大大地鼓舞了我国人民的建设热情。工业部门的工人和技术人员积极拥护党的指示，为了支援农村的机械化，展开着热火朝天的生产斗争。我国农民为了加速实现这个前景，也正在努力增产。他们今年在谷物方面，已达到战前水平的一点五倍以上，并提出了1959年的农业总产值达到今年的一点五倍到二倍的目标。
    人民生活的基本变化
    我国已经完成了城市的私人工商业的社会主义改造，完成了农村的农业合作化，社会主义生产关系在城市和农村都占有统治地位。这种情况不仅促进了工、农业的发展，而且也引起了人们的意识和生活上的基本变化，促使文化革命的迅速到来。
    我国在1956年就实行了全面初等义务教育制。在这个基础上，今年11月1日起实行原定1961年开始实行的全面的初中义务教育制。同时，为了实行技术义务教育制，我国正在积极地进行全面的筹备工作。这是我国文化革命的主要环节。
    党和共和国政府对于把城市和农村建成文化的城乡这件事给与深切的关怀。因为这也是安定和提高居民生活的方针之一。如今我国的城市和农村的面貌已经焕然一新，成为文化的城市和农村。特别是由于农村的电气化和机械化，使文化革命有了进一步发展。
    我国已经消灭了人剥削人的根源，贫穷在人民生活中永远消失了，人民生活日益富裕和幸福。1957年的国民收入比战前1949年增加了一倍，在同一期间职工的工资增加了一点三倍。特别是第一个五年计划期间劳动人民实际收入增长计划，原定为一点五倍，但是这一增长计划将提前两年于1959年完成。
    从停战起到1957年，在城市和农村建成了一千六百三十万平方公尺的文化住宅，而在1958年，仅由国家投资的住宅，将建成二百多万平方公尺，在第一个五年计划期间，农村将建设三十万幢以上的文化住宅。
    这样，我国人民的生活发生了巨大的变化，刚停战时，我们没有一吨钢材，没有一吨水泥，没有一吨化学肥料，吃的和穿的都非常不足。在这样的环境中，我国的劳动人民积极拥护朝鲜劳动党的英明的经济政策，拿起了第一把铁锹，来辛勤忘我地建设自己的祖国。然而，现在我国已经基本解决了衣食住的问题。党提出的任务是：在二、三年内，按人口平均计算每人可分配到纺织品三十公尺，肉四十公斤，牛乳四十六公斤，鸡蛋一百五十个以上。 
    朝鲜人民获得的巨大成就，是我们党的正确领导和对党无限忠诚的人民的忘我劳动的结果。事实正是这样，在党和劳动人民的统一和团结面前，没有克服不了的难关，没有突破不了的堡垒。以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党，在每个时期都指出最正确地反映着社会发展客观规律的路线和政策，并进一步动员群众的革命力量来贯彻这个路线和政策。全体党员和劳动人民像爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护党的统一和团结，他们像铜墙铁壁般团结在党的周围，响应党的号召，勇敢斗争，并取得了胜利。他们响应党中央委员会1956年12月全会为了跨过第一个五年计划的第一年的高峰而发出的关于“最大限度的增产和节约”的号召，积极动员起来，掀起了一个增产节约的运动。到1958年，他们又积极响应党的接二连三的号召，继续加快社会主义建设速度，因而带来了像今天这样空前的大高潮。但是，这种胜利并不是在没有任何困难的情况下所获得的。全体党员和劳动人民，在党的领导下，击退了曾存在一时的反党宗派分子的暗害活动，克服了保守主义分子和消极分子的阻碍，并且粉碎了国际修正主义者的计谋和美帝国主义与李承晚匪帮所派遣的破坏、暗害分子的阴谋，维护了社会主义的果实。
    过去在祖国解放战争中发挥了无畏的英雄战斗精神的我们全体党员和劳动人民，在今天又以千里马的雄姿展开了祖国的社会主义建设。
    我们已经取得的成就和今天的社会主义建设大高潮，是同伟大苏联和中华人民共和国以及其他兄弟国家人民的高尚的无产阶级国际主义的支持和声援分不开的。兄弟国家在战争时期和战后恢复建设时期给予我们的兄弟支持和声援，是我们胜利的主要因素。今天，朝鲜人民感到异常兴奋的是，我们正在同伟大中国人民的大跃进运动步调一致，互相协助，互相鼓励，并肩携手地飞跃前进。
    在马克思列宁主义党的领导下，中朝两国人民必将成功地完成自己祖国的社会主义和共产主义建设伟业。
