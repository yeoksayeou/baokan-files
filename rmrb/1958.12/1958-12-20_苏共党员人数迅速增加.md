Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th.  Churaev, Head of the Organizational Department of the Russian Federation Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, wrote in an article in the twenty-third issue of "Party Life" magazine that the number of people joining the party in the Soviet Union in the past two years has nearly doubled compared to the approximately three and a half years between the 19th and 20th Party Congresses.  In the Russian Federation's party organizations alone, more than 450,000 new members have been added during this period.  The new members are mainly advanced workers and collective farm members.  Among the new party members in the Russian Republic in 1955, workers accounted for 34.2% and collective farm members accounted for 17.5%. In 1957, workers accounted for 40.8% of the new party members, and collective farm members accounted for 20%.

Churaev pointed out that at present, when the Soviet people are accelerating the development of the national economy to solve the problem of building communism, the role of the party has grown even greater, and the requirements for party members are also higher. The Party requires party members to become active fighters in realizing the Party's policies, to continuously grasp Marxist-Leninist theory, and to play an exemplary role in labor and social work.

    苏共党员人数迅速增加
    新华社莫斯科19日电  苏联共产党中央委员会俄罗斯联邦局组织部长丘拉耶夫在二十三期“党的生活”杂志写的一篇文章中说，最近两年来苏联入党的人数比第十九次到二十次党代表大会的约三年半时间内入党人数增加了将近一倍。仅俄罗斯联邦各地党组织在这期间内就增加了四十五万多名党员。新入党的主要是先进工人和集体农庄庄员。1955年俄罗斯共和国新入党的人中工人占34.2％、集体农庄庄员占17.5％。1957年入党的党员中工人已占40.8％、集体农庄庄员占20％。
    丘拉耶夫指出，目前当苏联人民正在加速发展国民经济以解决建设共产主义的问题时，党的作用更增长了，对党员的要求，也更高了。党要求党员成为实现党的政策的积极战士，要求党员不断掌握马列主义理论，并在劳动和社会工作中起模范作用。
