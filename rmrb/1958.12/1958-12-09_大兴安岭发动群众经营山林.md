Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 8th December: In the Greater Khingan Range forest area of Inner Mongolia, the area of forest renewal work and the quantity of seed collection in the latter half of this year have greatly exceeded the achievements of the first Five-Year Plan period.
　　In the past, forest renewal and seed collection in the Greater Khingan Range mainly relied on the six or seven thousand employees of a dozen or so forest management bureaus. However, the Greater Khingan Range covers a vast area, and relying solely on these professional workers made progress very slow. In August this year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee's Forest Area Work Conference pointed out that it is necessary to rely on the whole Party and the entire people to manage forests. Since then, Party organizations and forestry departments at all levels in the Greater Khingan Range forest area have conducted ideological education among the broad masses in the forest area on the necessity of relying on the mountains for sustenance and the need to nurture them, which stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses in the forest area to participate in forest management. A forest renewal and seed collection movement was launched. In August, a high tide of forest renewal was set off, with the participation not only of workers but also of family members and students, totaling more than 20,000 people. When there were insufficient seedlings in the nurseries, people dug up wild seedlings and transplanted them. Subsequently, more than 30,000 people were put into the seed collection movement, and to date, 40,000 kilograms of Dahurian Larch and Scots Pine seeds have been collected, exceeding the total number of seeds collected during the first Five-Year Plan period by 4.6 times.
　　In addition, the no-forest-fire movement this autumn was also widely carried out. The masses in the forest area all know the importance of forest protection and fire prevention, and there are fire prevention covenants everywhere. Women earnestly stood guard at key intersections, preventing people from taking matches and other sources of fire up the mountain. People did not smoke outdoors, so there were no forest fires this autumn.

    大兴安岭发动群众经营山林
    新华社牙克石8日电  内蒙古大兴安岭林区今年下半年森林更新作业的面积和采种的数量，都大大超过第一个五年计划期间的成绩。
  过去大兴安岭的森林更新和采种工作，主要依靠十几个森林经营局的六、七千名职工来作。但是大兴安岭幅员广大，仅仅依靠这些专业职工，经营工作就显得进展很慢。今年8月间，内蒙古自治区党委林区工作会议指出，必须依靠全党全民经营山林。此后，大兴安岭林区各级党组织和林业部门向林区广大群众进行靠山吃山必需养山的思想教育，启发了林区广大群众参加经营森林的积极性。森林更新和采种运动展开了。8月间掀起了森林更新高潮，参加的不仅有职工，而且有家属和学生，共达两万多人。苗圃里的树苗不足了，人们就挖野生苗木移植。接着，又有三万多人投入了采种运动，到目前止已采集落叶松和樟子松种子四万公斤，超过第一个五年计划期间采种总数四点六倍。
    此外，今秋无森林火灾运动开展得也很广泛。林区群众人人皆知护林防火的重要性，处处有防火公约。要路口上妇女们认真站岗放哨，不让人们把火柴等火源带上山去。人们都不在外面吸烟，因此今秋未发生森林火灾。
