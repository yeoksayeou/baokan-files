Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 9th: The Standing Council of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations and the Standing Committee of the Executive Committee of the National Convention for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament held a joint meeting in Tokyo today. They decided on a policy of launching a campaign from the end of this year to March next year to oppose the revision and demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to demand the opening of Sino-Japanese relations.

The policy stipulates that these two organizations will hold a movement month against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in February and March next year. They will also launch a large-scale signature campaign and promote a campaign for the Japanese people to wear badges calling for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, in coordination with the people's march against war and unemployment initiated by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and various peace rallies sponsored by the Japan Peace Committee and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

The policy also stipulates that lectures and discussion meetings will be held in many prefectures across the country in December of this year and January of next year to prepare for the unified actions to be launched in the future.

The meeting issued a statement condemning the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to hold negotiations with the United States to revise the "Security Treaty" and expressed its determination to strive for the abolition of this treaty that hinders the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

The statement pointed out that this treaty was originally a treaty hostile to China and the Soviet Union and is the root cause of Japan's subordination to the United States.

The statement continued that the current negotiations between Japan and the United States are aimed at accelerating Japan's nuclear armament and clearing the way for aggression in Asia. The statement refuted the Nobusuke Kishi government's slanderous remarks that the statements made by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi and the Soviet government, respectively, on the U.S.-Japan negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty" were "interference in Japan's internal affairs," and demanded the immediate cessation of the negotiations.

    废除日美“安全条约”打开日中关系
    日本两大团体决定开展运动
    新华社9日讯  东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议常任理事会、打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会实行委员会常任委员会今天在东京举行联席会议，决定了从今年年底到明年3月展开反对修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”、要求打开日中关系运动的方针。
    方针规定，这两个团体将在明年2、3月间举行反对日美“安全条约”运动月，并且要大规模地展开签名运动和推进日本人民佩戴要求恢复日中邦交的徽章的运动，来配合日本工会总评议会发起的反对战争和失业的人民大游行、日本和平委员会和日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会主办的各种拥护和平的集会。
    方针还规定在今年12月和明年1月在全国的许多府、县举行讲演会、讨论会等，为今后将要展开的统一行动进行准备。
    会议发表了一项声明，谴责岸信介政府同美国举行修改“安全条约”谈判的阴谋，并且表示了争取废除这项阻碍恢复日中邦交的条约的决心。
    声明指出，这项条约原来就是敌视中国和苏联的条约，并且是使日本处于从属美国的地位的根源。
    声明接着说，目前日美举行的谈判是为了加紧使日本进行核武装，为侵略亚洲扫清道路。声明驳斥了岸信介政府诬蔑中国外交部长陈毅和苏联政府分别就日美关于修改“安全条约”谈判所发表的声明是“干涉日本内政”的颠倒是非的说法，并且要求立即停止这次谈判。
