    Gathering Firewood in the Snowy Mountains
    Wang Zuo

    In the twelfth lunar month, I came to the ice-and-snow-covered Northeast. My first labor lesson was to go deep into the mountains to gather firewood.

    Early in the morning, the north wind was blowing hard. Old commune member Li Changfa came to call us to go up the mountain. I saw that each of us thirty-odd new commune members, were just like me, adding another layer of fortification on the “cold-proof front,” all bundled up. I asked Old Li, "You're only wearing that little, aren't you cold?"

    He said, "It doesn't matter. It's just that gathering firewood ruins clothes. One trip up the mountain and you'll have several holes."

    We walked several miles out of the village to reach Shaojia Gully. All the way, we only heard the sound of *cha, cha, cha*. I was afraid of slipping when going up the mountain, but I kept slipping anyway. "I'd better pull you. The snow is thick, you can't see where the pits and bumps are. It's no joke falling down." After Old Li finished speaking, he didn't care whether I agreed or not, and forcefully grabbed my arm, pulling and dragging me to the top of the mountain.

    Now it was our turn, this group of pale-faced intellectuals, to use the firewood sickles. We were cutting branches with sickles that day. I was simply hopeless, unable to cut through anything, unable to tie anything up. On the snowy mountain, I exerted effort from this side to that side, and then from that side to this side, and only managed to cut a few bundles after a long time. I stole a glance at Old Li. Besides doing his own work, he was holding someone's hand to teach them for a while, and then holding another's hand to teach them. He leaped over, jumped over, as agile as a roe deer moving in and out of this mountain gully.

    The piles of firewood grew higher and higher, and we went from cold to hot, our backs all sweaty. At this time, I was extremely thirsty, and couldn't help but grab handfuls of snow to quench my thirst. Some comrades suggested taking a break, but others objected. The reason was: "We can't rest. If we rest, the sweat on our backs will freeze, and wouldn't that be like wearing an ice-frozen jacket? Let's still go all out, strive for the upper reaches, and work until dinner!" In the winter months, the days are short and the nights are long. The rule here is two meals a day. We eat the first meal at eight o'clock in the morning, and the last meal at four o'clock in the evening.

    When the lights were lit at night, the first lesson in labor was far from over. Wet shoes, wet socks, cotton trousers that were about to be completely wet, wet cotton jacket sleeves, wet leggings… a big pile, all had to be dried, because we had to go up the mountain tomorrow, and we couldn't possibly wear wet clothes. So we gathered in groups of three or five around the fire to dry our wet clothes, chatting as we did so. I don't know who added a bundle of firewood to the fire at this time, diverting the topic. Someone said, "Can you add less? You should know how much effort it takes to gather firewood, right?" Everyone agreed that this was truly the first time in their lives that they realized that "every piece of firewood, every piece of wood, is hard-earned."

    "Are we still having a hard time? Old commune members only have one set of cotton clothes and trousers. If they get wet, they can only lie on the kang and wait for others to dry them. That's really hard." After this was mentioned, we all unanimously thought of Li Changfa, and unanimously dedicated our heartfelt gratitude and warm praise to this poor peasant old commune member who was always so energetic and enthusiastic. We talked about him for a long time.

    雪山打柴
    王作
    腊月里来到冰天雪地的东北，劳动第一课就是到深山里打柴去。
    大清早北风刮得紧，老社员厉长发来招呼我们上山去。我一看，我们这三十多个新社员，一个个都像我似的，在“防寒战线”上又加添了一道工事，穿得鼓鼓的。我问老厉：“你就穿那点，不冷？”
    他说：“不碍事，就是打柴费衣服，上趟山就是几个窟窿。”
    出村好几里才走到邵家沟，一路上只听见嚓、嚓、嚓作响，我在上山时生怕滑倒，却偏偏爱滑倒。“还是我来拉着你吧。雪厚，看不出哪是坑哪是坎，掉下去不是玩的。”老厉说完也不管我同意不同意，就有劲地一把抓住我的手臂，把我连提带拉拖上了山巅。
    现在轮到我们这批白面书生们来使用柴镰刀了。这天我们割的是薪条，用镰刀。我简直笨死了，割是割不断，捆是捆不上，在雪山上从这边吃劲地到那边，又从那边吃劲地到这边，老半天只割了几捆。我偷空看看老厉，只见他除了自己干活，还一回儿把着手教这个，一回儿又把着手教那个。他跃过来，跳过去，灵活得就像一只出没在这山沟里的狍子。
    柴禾捆越堆越高，我们也由冷到热，背上汗津津的了。我这时一个劲地口渴，忍不住只得抓起一把把的雪来解渴。有同志提议休息一会儿，也有人反对。理由是：“歇不得呀，歇下来背上的汗会上冻的，那不就成了穿冰冻夹克了吗？咱们还是鼓足干劲，力争上游干到吃晚饭吧！”冬腊月昼短夜长，这里的规矩一天两餐。早上八点多吃头顿，到晚上四点才吃晚饭。
    晚上点灯的时候这劳动第一课还远没有结束。湿鞋、湿袜，快湿完了的棉裤，湿棉袄袖，湿绑腿……一大堆，都得烤干，明天还要上山，终不成穿湿的去。我们就三个一堆五个一群向着火烤湿衣服，一边聊着天。不知谁在这时在火上添上一抱柴禾，把话题给转移了。有人说：“你少添点好不好？打柴要费多少力气你该知道了吧？”大家都同意这真是生平第一次领会到“一柴一木，来处不易”。
    “咱们还难？老社员只有一身棉袄裤，弄湿了只能趴在炕上等别人烤，才真难呢。”经这一提，我们都不约而同想起了厉长发，又不约而同把我们由衷的感激和热烈的赞扬献给这位老是那么精神抖擞、热情洋溢的贫农老社员。很久我们还在谈论着他。
