Seeing People and Seeing Things
　　Wang Pu

　　In the Great Leap Forward, countless facts have repeatedly proven a Marxist principle: people are the most active factor in the productive forces. Therefore, no matter what work is done, it is necessary to put politics in command, mobilize the masses to speak out freely, air views fully, and hold great debates, pay attention to adjusting the mutual relationships between people, criticize various backward ideas, and give full play to people's subjective initiative.

　　However, does emphasizing putting politics in command and emphasizing giving play to people's subjective initiative negate the role of material and technical conditions in production? No. Production is like fighting a war. Without certain weapons and without being good at using weapons, a war cannot be won. Without certain material and technical conditions, the quantity and quality of production cannot be guaranteed. Take iron smelting as an example. With only the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, without good furnace types and other necessary equipment, and without teaching the masses to master smelting technology, good iron will not be smelted, but only sintered iron will be produced, and even sintered iron may not be produced. To improve the output and quality of iron, the decisive issue after putting politics in command is technology.

　　We say that the important role of material and technical conditions in production cannot be denied, but this has nothing in common with the views of those who advocate a purely materialist approach. Those who advocate a purely materialist approach absolutize the role of material and technical conditions and deny people's subjective initiative. They see things but not people, want technology to be in command but not politics, only consult with a few engineering and technical personnel on matters, do not mobilize the broad masses of workers and staff, and make the situation cold and lifeless. We believe that matter is created by people, and technology is mastered by people. Under the same material and technical conditions, the results of production vary greatly because people's ideological awareness is different and their enthusiasm is different. Only when people's subjective initiative is fully developed can material and technical conditions play the greatest role. That is to say, only under the premise of putting politics in command can material and technical conditions play a decisive role.

　　A purely materialist approach, seeing things but not people, is, from the perspective of ideology and methodology, metaphysical mechanical materialism, and from the perspective of politics, it is a denial of the Party's leadership. This is very wrong and must be criticized. However, we must not go to the other extreme: only emphasizing putting politics in command and people's subjective initiative, while ignoring the important role of material and technical conditions. Thinking that: as long as politics is in command and the masses are mobilized, one can do whatever one wants. In work, as long as the masses are mobilized to set advanced targets, there is no need to ask about improving equipment conditions, learning and mastering technology. Even completely disregarding material and technical conditions. If this is the case, advanced targets can only become empty talk. Because people's subjective initiative must be combined with objective and certain material and technical conditions to produce results. We oppose a purely materialist approach, but that does not mean we do not want conditions. Dialectical materialists both recognize the dominating role of objective conditions on people and recognize people's reaction to objective conditions. Emphasizing putting politics in command and emphasizing giving play to people's subjective initiative does not mean denying the role of material and technical conditions; on the contrary, it is precisely to recognize the important role of material and technical conditions, so that people can better master it, use it, be its master, and not be its slave.

　　The relationship between politics and technology, the relationship between people's subjective initiative and material and technical conditions, is the unity of two opposites. Political work is the guarantee for completing technical work, and it is also the soul and commander of technical work. If politics is not in command, technical work will go astray. People's subjective initiative can influence material and technical conditions, but it cannot be separated from material and technical conditions. We must unite putting politics in command and paying attention to material and technical work, unite giving play to people's subjective initiative and improving material and technical conditions, and see both people and things. In this way, we can combine the soaring enthusiasm and lofty aspirations of the broad masses with scientific analysis and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and base advanced targets on reliable objective possibilities.

    见人又见物
    王朴
    在大跃进中，无数事实反复证明了马克思主义的一个原理：人是生产力中最活跃的因素。因此，不论做什么工作，必须政治挂帅，发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论，注意调整人与人之间的互相关系，批判各种落后思想，把人的主观能动作用充分发挥出来。
    然而，强调政治挂帅，强调发挥人的主观能动作用，是不是否认物质技术条件在生产中的作用呢？不是。生产和打仗一样。没有一定的武器，不善于使用武器，仗就打不赢。没有一定的物质技术条件，生产的数量和质量也就没有保证。拿炼铁来说，光有群众的冲天干劲，没有好的炉型和其它必要设备，不教会群众掌握冶炼技术，就不会炼出好铁来，而只能出烧结铁，甚至连烧结铁也不出。要提高铁的产量和质量，在政治挂帅以后，决定性的问题是技术。
    我们说，不能否认物质技术条件在生产中的重要作用，这跟那些唯条件论者的意见毫无共同之处。唯条件论者把物质技术条件的作用绝对化，否认人的主观能动作用。他们见物不见人，要技术挂帅不要政治挂帅，有事只找少数工程技术人员商量，不发动广大的职工群众，把局面搞得冷冷清清，毫无生气。我们认为物质是人创造的，技术是人掌握的。在同样的物质技术条件下，因为人的思想觉悟不同，干劲大小不同，生产的结果也迥异。只有把人的主观能动作用充分发挥起来，物质技术条件才能发挥最大的效果。也就是说，只有在政治挂帅的前提下，物质技术条件才能起决定作用。
    唯条件论、见物不见人，从思想方法上讲，是形而上学的机械唯物论，从政治上讲，是否认党的领导。这是十分错误的，必须批判。但是，也不能跑到另一个极端：只强调政治挂帅和人的主观能动作用，而忽视物质技术条件的重要作用。以为：只要政治一挂帅，群众一发动起来，就可以随心所欲了。在工作中，只要发动群众订先进指标，至于改进设备条件学习和掌握技术，就不必过问了。甚至根本不考虑物质技术条件。如果是这样，先进的指标只能成为空谈。因为人的主观能动作用，必须和客观的一定的物质技术条件相结合才能产生效果。我们反对唯条件论，并不是不要条件。辩证唯物主义者是既承认客观条件对人的支配作用，又承认人对客观条件的反作用的。强调政治挂帅，强调发挥人的主观能动作用，并不是否认物质技术条件的作用，恰恰相反，正是承认物质技术条件的重要作用，使人们更好地掌握它，运用它，要做它的主人，不要做它的奴隶。
    政治和技术的关系、人的主观能动作用和物质技术条件的关系，是两个对立物的统一。政治工作是完成技术工作的保证，又是技术工作的灵魂和统帅，政治不挂帅，技术工作就会走到邪路上去。人的主观能动作用可以影响物质技术条件，但又不能离开物质技术条件。我们必须把政治挂帅和重视物质技术工作统一起来，把发挥人的主观能动作用和改进物质技术条件统一起来，见人又见物。这样，才能把广大群众的冲天干劲、凌云壮志和科学分析、实事求是的精神结合起来，把先进的指标建立在可靠的客观可能性的基础上。
