Experiences in Carrying Out a Mass Movement to Study Philosophy
The Propaganda Department of the Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province

A mass movement to study philosophy is unfolding throughout Lushan County. Thanks to the attention of Party committees at all levels, the mobilization of the masses, the breaking of superstitions, and the emancipation of minds, this movement has achieved good results. The facts tell us that it is not difficult for workers and peasants to study philosophy, and they study it very well; the problem lies in leadership, in breaking superstitions, and in mobilizing the masses.

Breaking the Mysticism and Skepticism of Studying Philosophy Through Mass Unfolding of Ideas, Free Airing of Views, and Great Debates

With the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, as well as the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Party members and cadres in the county and townships have an increasingly urgent need to study theory. However, many people still have doubts about the masses studying philosophy. For example, they believe that "peasants and grassroots cadres have low levels and cannot learn," emphasize that "there are few full-time theoretical cadres and no teachers," and fear that studying philosophy will delay production and work.

In order to eliminate these ideological obstacles, we have taken the following measures. First, the county Party committee issued instructions pointing out the necessity and favorable conditions for carrying out mass philosophy study, stipulating the "serving politics and production" orientation of learning, and requiring "Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership." As a result, Party committees in various districts and townships have repeatedly conducted special studies on the issue of mass philosophy study, with secretaries taking the lead in giving lectures and committee members dividing up responsibilities to oversee specific areas. Second, we focused on key learning points and established learning models. At the county Party committee's enlarged meeting, the first secretary of the county Party committee used the example of the town of Chengguan studying philosophy to criticize the view that workers and peasants could not learn philosophy. Third, we adopted a method of explaining and debating simultaneously, using newspapers, radio, expanded cadre meetings, and mass meetings to vigorously promote the study of philosophy. On this basis, we launched a great unfolding of ideas, free airing of views, and great debates, with the content focusing on what philosophy is, whether it is difficult to learn philosophy, why to learn philosophy, and how to learn philosophy. Through trial lectures and debates, we broke the mystical views on studying philosophy. As a result, many workers and peasants organized to study philosophy during the intense labor of steel smelting and deep plowing of land.

Starting from Reality, Serving Political Struggle and Production Struggle, Promoting Production, and Raising Mass Awareness

"Serving political struggle and production struggle" is the correct method and path for studying theory.

From what starting point should we study philosophy? Why should we study philosophy? These are fundamental issues that must be resolved in the philosophy study movement. There are two opposing opinions on this issue: one is the opinion of the majority of cadres and the masses, who advocate starting from reality, learning what they do, and applying what they learn. This method correctly reflects and implements the Party's policy of theoretical education. The other is the opinion of a small number of cadres and some intellectuals, who advocate only studying the principles in books and not being in a hurry to connect with problems in production. This method is contrary to the Party's policy of theoretical education.

In order to distinguish between right and wrong, we launched a great debate on the orientation of philosophy study among the masses. Through airing of views and debates, we criticized the tendency of dogmatism and resolutely implemented the study line of "serving political struggle and production struggle." The general approach is to start from reality, use philosophical principles as weapons, and take the issues in political struggle and production struggle as content, in order to achieve the goal of raising mass ideology and promoting production.

The specific methods are roughly as follows: First, when deploying work and production tasks, use philosophical principles to analyze and explain the favorable conditions and significance of completing the tasks, criticize right-leaning conservative ideas and erroneous attitudes, and ensure the completion of the tasks. In the deep plowing of land campaign in Malou Township, the principle of the development of things was used to explain that deep plowing of land and applying more fertilizer are requirements of the growth law of food crops, criticized erroneous ideas such as "less labor, heavy task, cannot be completed" and "workers and peasants compete for labor and ask the state for machines," and launched a movement to offer suggestions and ideas, quickly forming a high tide of land turning. Second, use philosophical principles to explain the current issues in class struggle, so that the workers and peasants can further draw a clear line in the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, and firmly take the socialist road. Third, use philosophical principles to analyze and explain the practical experience of the masses in production struggle, and guide production. For example, using the experience of farmers regarding agricultural production as content, explain the seasonal laws of agricultural production and the laws of crop growth, so that the masses of farmers recognize the importance of mastering the laws in production. After studying, the farmers of Dongcun Township realized that land turning must conform to the seasonal laws of production, criticized the slack mood, and worked hard to turn the land. Fourth, when implementing the Party's policies, use philosophical principles to explain the basic spirit of the policies and improve the masses' awareness of implementing the policies. When implementing the policy of giving equal importance to large, medium and small-sized enterprises, industry and agriculture, and the central and local governments, put forward by the Party Central Committee, use the principles of dialectics to explain the basic spirit and interrelationships of the policy, criticize the one-sided views of "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting industry," "emphasizing foreign and neglecting local," and the idea that industry and agriculture cannot leap forward in an all-round way, and establish the idea and confidence of an all-round leap forward. Fifth, when summarizing and inspecting work, use philosophical principles to analyze the experience and lessons in the work and their roots, and arm cadres and the masses with materialistic views and dialectical methods. The Xiatang District Committee, through summarizing the lesson of "failing to promote rice blindly based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, resulting in reduced production," realized that objective conditions are the starting point of all work. Through study, the vast majority of cadres overcame the subjective and one-sided ways of thinking and the working style of coercion and commandism, established the working style of seeking truth from facts and investigation and research, strengthened political and ideological education, strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and promoted the work.

Those Who Are Able Are Teachers, Learn First and Then Teach, Self-Compiled and Self-Taught, Widely Organize Mass Lecture Teams

In the mass philosophy study movement, the county Party committee and the Party committees of various districts and townships, in accordance with the spirit of "those who are able are teachers, learners are apprentices, learn first and then teach, self-compiled and self-taught," widely mobilized the masses and smoothly solved the problems of organization, teachers, and teaching materials for studying philosophy.

Establishing a strong mass lecture team is a process of correctly implementing the Party's mass line and overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas. In August of this year, when the mass philosophy study movement began, the primary task before us was who would serve as philosophy teachers. There were two different views and methods. One view was: most people believe that "the masses are the main source of a large number of teachers." They believe that the broad masses are direct participants in production struggles and class struggles, and after a long period of Party education and cultural learning, they have a certain level of political and cultural knowledge and rich practical struggle knowledge, so they can not only learn philosophy, but also be able to teach philosophy after a certain period of study. Therefore, they advocated mobilizing the masses to train and establish a lecture team among the masses. A small number of people believed that "lecturers can only be taken on by intellectuals and cadres." They believe that the cultural level of workers and peasants is low and their knowledge is shallow, so they cannot be lecturers. Some farmers also believe that they have no capital and are rough, so they cannot be lecturers. Therefore, they advocated solving the problem of teachers by greatly increasing the number of full-time theoretical teachers. This is essentially a reflection of two learning methods in theoretical education work, and a debate on the direction of solving the problem of teachers. The county Party committee believed that it was necessary to thoroughly distinguish between right and wrong in order to effectively carry out the movement. Therefore, the county Party committee first issued instructions to establish a mass lecture team, calling on secretaries and members of Party committees at all levels to take the lead as lecturers, and vigorously launched a propaganda movement through newspapers, radio, and various meetings. At the same time, from top to bottom, from inside to outside, another great debate was organized. Through checking tasks, checking strengths, and checking methods, the "skepticism" of a small number of cadres and the masses was criticized, and the fundamental direction of solving the problem of teachers was clarified. After the county Party committee's instructions were issued, the number of lecturers in various places greatly increased, and many outstanding lecturers emerged one after another. The county Party committee seized on the fact that Niu Yunqing (deputy secretary of the branch), a 61-year-old man from Dongcun Township, gave lectures on philosophy everywhere in vivid and popular language, and gave a vivid practical education to the broad masses, giving a powerful rebuttal to all "skeptics." Many "skeptics" changed from skepticism to belief, and from being timid to being daring to think and act.

Four Advantages of the Masses as Lecturers

In this way, a lecture team was quickly formed throughout the county, including Party committee secretaries, grassroots Party and League members, commune cadres, model workers, activists, district and township cadres, and cadres sent to lower levels. Under the direct leadership and cultivation of Party committees at all levels, they played a huge role in teaching. The basic method of carrying out the work is: first, the Party committees of various districts and townships take the township area as a unit, and in accordance with the method of "teaching and training simultaneously, teaching and training at the same time, one lecture and one training," conduct training through lecture teams, lecture groups, dissemination stations and various meetings. After the training, the teachers immediately go to various areas, companies, platoons and construction sites, factories, canteens, fields, workshops and other occasions to give explanations. Second, borrow teaching materials and help summarize and promote the experience in learning. In particular, Party committees at all levels personally took charge, took the lead in giving lectures, and set an example, solving many problems in learning. This not only smoothly carried out the teaching work, but also cultivated and improved the level of the lecturers. Facts have proved that the broad masses of workers and peasants can not only learn philosophy, but also learn it very well; many people can not only teach it, but also teach it very well. Moreover, mass lecturers also show the following excellent styles and characteristics:

First, in the process of lecturing, they can implement the class viewpoint, the production viewpoint, and the mass viewpoint, and closely link the ideological situation of various classes in the local area. Second, they can keenly discover all kinds of problems in the work process and production process in the local township, and in a timely manner, according to the Party's policies and philosophical principles, conduct targeted teaching starting from reality. Third, they have close ties with the masses and are trusted by the broad masses, and in lecturing, they have achieved popularization and simplification. Fourth, they are scattered to various fronts (industry, agriculture, culture and health, government agencies) and various corners (construction sites, canteens, fields, workshops, etc.), and in various periods, even in the busiest periods, they can conduct teaching flexibly and dynamically.

From Shallow to Deep, Popularize First and Then Improve

"From shallow to deep, popularize first and then improve" is a successful experience of the Lushan County Party Committee in leading the masses to study philosophy.

However, there were also two different views on this issue at the beginning. One view advocates starting from reality, learning what you do, popularizing it first, and then gradually improving it; the other view advocates starting from books, applying the principles in books to the current reality, and taking accepting the principles in books as the sole purpose. In response to these two different views, the county Party committee, on the one hand, conducted in-depth experiments in key areas, and on the other hand, widely organized the masses to carry out great debates. Through trial lectures and debates, the broad masses of cadres and farmers agreed with the first view and opposed the second view.

According to the requirements of the broad masses of cadres and farmers, the county Party committee implemented the principle of going from shallow to deep, improving on the basis of popularization, popularizing under the guidance of improvement, and combining popularization and improvement. In terms of popularization, the following measures were taken: First, holding a telephone conference, emphasizing that Party committees at all levels must strengthen specific leadership over this work by disseminating key experiences. Second, compiling and printing popular teaching materials. The method is that on the one hand, the Propaganda Department compiles and prints, and on the other hand, promotes good teaching materials from below. Third, organizing radio lectures, broadcasting philosophy to the entire county every Monday and Thursday on the county radio station. Fourth, speaking highly of the fact that Niu Yunqing of Dongcun can give lectures on philosophy to the masses, to stimulate the enthusiasm of cadres to teach and the masses to learn. In this way, the mass philosophy study movement quickly became popular throughout the county.

In order to make the movement develop in a balanced direction and move towards common improvement, the county Party committee held an on-site meeting in Dongcun on October 4. Through visits, interviews, and discussions, it summarized and exchanged experiences in popularization and improvement, and also inspected the problems that currently exist in the area of improvement. Everyone believes that in order to improve, the following tasks must be done well: First, continue to implement the policy of learning serving production and serving political struggle, so that learning is closely integrated with socialist and communist education this winter and next spring. Second, continuously summarize and inspect work, and hold on-site meetings in a timely manner to summarize and exchange work experience, and inspect and solve problems. Third, train teachers and improve the quality of lectures. Combine the existing teachers with the socialist and communist education movement this winter and next spring to train them again. Fourth, combine current production, work, and the thinking of cadres and the masses, and compile teaching materials that are slightly deeper than in the past. Fifth, strengthen the leadership of the Party committee over the existing learning organizations, and listen to reports and check learning situations regularly or irregularly.

At present, the philosophy study movement throughout the county is developing towards improvement.

    开展群众学哲学运动的经验
    中共河南省鲁山县委宣传部
    一个学哲学的群众运动，正在鲁山全县范围内开展着。由于各级党委重视，发动群众，破除迷信，解放思想，所以这个运动收到了良好的效果。事实告诉我们，工农学习哲学不但不难，而且学习的很好；问题在于领导，在于破除迷信，发动群众。
    通过群众大鸣大放大辩论破除学哲学的神秘论和怀疑论
    随着整风运动和反右派斗争的胜利及工农业生产的大跃进，县、乡的党员和干部对学习理论的要求越来越迫切了。但是，不少人对群众学哲学还有怀疑。如认为“农民和基层干部水平低学不成”；强调“专职理论干部少，没教员”；怕学哲学误生产、误工作。
    为了扫除这些思想障碍，我们采取了以下措施。首先，县委发出指示，指出开展群众学哲学的必要性和有利条件，规定学习要“为政治和为生产服务”的方针，要求“各级党委要加强领导”。于是，各区、乡党委对群众学哲学的问题都反复进行了专门研究，并由书记挂帅讲课，党委委员分片包干。其次，搞好学习重点，树立学习旗帜。县委第一书记在县委扩大会议上，用城关镇学哲学的事实，批判了不相信工人农民能学哲学的观点。第三，采用边讲解、边辩论的方法，利用报纸、广播、扩干会议、群众会，大张旗鼓地开展学哲学的宣传。在这个基础上，以什么是哲学、学哲学难不难、为什么学哲学和怎样学哲学等问题为内容，开展大鸣大放大辩论。经过试讲和辩论，破除了对学哲学的神秘观点。因此，许多工人农民在炼钢铁和深翻土地的紧张劳动中组织学习哲学。
    从实际出发，为政治斗争和生产斗争服务，推动生产，提高群众觉悟
    “为政治斗争和生产斗争服务”，是学习理论的正确方法和道路。
    从什么出发学哲学？为什么学哲学？是学哲学运动中必须解决的根本问题，对这个问题有两种对立的意见：一种是大多数干部和群众的意见，他们主张从实际出发，做什么学什么，学了就用。这种方法正确体现和贯彻了党的理论教育方针。另一种是少数干部和部分知识分子的意见，他们主张只学习书本上的原理，不急于联系生产中的问题。这种方法和党的理论教育方针是对立的。
    为了分清是非，在群众中开展了哲学学习方针的大辩论，通过鸣放争辩，批驳了教条主义倾向，坚决贯彻了“为政治斗争和生产斗争服务”的学习路线。总的作法，是从实际出发，以哲学原理为武器，以政治斗争和生产斗争中的问题为内容，来达到提高群众思想和推动生产的目的。
    具体作法大体有以下几种：一，在布置工作和生产任务时，用哲学原理分析阐述完成任务的有利条件和意义，批判右倾保守思想和错误态度，保证任务的完成。马楼乡在深翻土地运动中，以事物发展的原理，讲明深翻土地多施肥是粮食作物生长规律的要求，批判了“劳力少，任务大，完不成”和“工农争劳力向国家要机器”等错误思想，开展了献计献策运动，迅速形成翻地高潮。二，用哲学原理阐述当前阶级斗争中的问题，使工农群众进一步划清两个阶级、两条道路斗争中的界限，坚定地走社会主义道路。三，用哲学原理分析阐述了群众在生产斗争中的实际经验，指导生产。如以农民群众关于农业生产的经验为内容，讲解农业生产的季节规律和作物生长的规律，使农民群众认识到在生产中掌握规律的重要性。董村乡的农民学习后，认识到翻地必须符合生产的季节规律，批判了松劲情绪，大干翻地。四，贯彻党的方针政策时，用哲学原理阐述了政策的基本精神，提高群众执行政策的自觉性。在贯彻党中央提出的大中小并举、工农业并举和中央地方并举的方针时，用辩证法的原理阐述了方针的基本精神和相互关系，批判了“重农轻工”、“重洋轻土”和工农业不能全面跃进的片面观点，树立了全面跃进的思想和信心。五，总结检查工作时，用哲学原理分析工作中的经验教训及其根源，以唯物观点和辩证方法武装干部和群众。下汤区委通过总结“不根据因地制宜原则，盲目推广水稻，遭到减产”的教训，认识到客观条件是一切工作的出发点。通过学习，绝大多数干部都克服了主观片面的思想方法和强迫命令的工作作风，树立了实事求是和调查研究的工作作风，加强了政治思想教育，密切了干群关系，推动了工作。能者为师  先学后教  自编自讲广泛组织群众性的讲师队伍在群众学哲学运动中，县委和各区、乡党委按照“能者为师，学者为徒，先学后教，自编自讲”的精神，广泛发动了群众，顺利地解决了学哲学的组织、师资和教材的问题。
    建立一支强大的群众讲师队伍，是正确贯彻党的群众路线和克服右倾保守思想的过程。今年8月，当群众学哲学运动开始的时候，摆在面前的首要任务，是由谁来充任哲学教员的问题。有两种不同的观点和方法。一种是：大部分人认为“群众是产生大量师资的主要源泉。”他们认为，广大群众是生产斗争和阶级斗争的直接参加者，经过党的长期教育和文化学习，有一定的政治文化水平和丰富的实践斗争知识，因而不仅能够学哲学，而且经过一定时期的学习后，也能够讲哲学。因此，他们主张发动群众，在群众中培养和建立讲师队伍。另一少部分人则认为“讲师只能由知识分子和干部来担任”。他们认为，工农群众文化低，知识浅，不能作讲师。有的农民也认为，自己没本钱，是大老粗，不能作讲师。因此，他们主张以大量增加专职理论教员来解决师资问题。这在实质上是两种学习方法在理论教育工作中的反映，是解决师资方向问题的争论。县委认为，必须彻底分清是非，才能有效地开展运动。因此，县委首先发出了建立群众性的讲师队伍的指示，号召各级党委书记、委员带头作讲师，并通过报纸、广播和各种会议，大张旗鼓地开展了宣传运动。与此同时，自上而下，自内而外，组织了又一次的大辩论。通过查任务、查力量、查办法，批判了少部分干部和群众的“怀疑论”，明确了解决师资的根本方向。在县委指示下达后，各地讲师人数大大增加，并且相继出现了许多优秀讲师。县委抓住了董村乡六十一岁的牛运卿（支部副书记）以生动通俗的语言到处大讲哲学的事实，向广大群众进行了一次生动的实际教育，给一切“怀疑论”者一次有力的批驳。不少的“怀疑派”变怀疑为相信，变畏首畏尾为敢想敢干。
    群众作讲师的四个优点
    这样，全县很快地组成了一支讲师队伍，其中有党委书记、基层党团员、社干、劳模、积极分子、区乡干部和下放干部等。他们在各级党委的直接领导和培养下，在教学中发挥了巨大的作用。进行工作的基本方法是：首先由各区乡党委以乡片为单位，根据“边讲边训，随讲随训，一讲一训”的办法，通过讲师团、讲师组、传授站和各种会议进行训练，训后教员即分赴各片、连、排及工地、工厂、食堂、田间、车间等场合进行讲解。其次，借给教材，帮助总结推广学习中的经验。特别是各级党委亲自挂帅，带头讲课，树立榜样，解决了学习中的许多问题。这就不但顺利地开展了教学工作，而且培养和提高了讲师的水平。事实证明，广大工农群众不但能学哲学，而且学的很好；很多人不但会讲，而且讲的很好。并且，群众讲师还显示出如下优良风格和特点：
    首先，他们在讲课过程中，能够贯彻阶级观点、生产观点和群众观点，密切联系本地各阶层的思想情况。其次，他们能够敏锐地发现本地本乡工作过程中和生产过程中的种种问题，及时地根据党的方针政策和哲学原理，从实际出发进行有的放矢的教学。第三，他们和群众有密切联系并为广大群众所信任，在讲课中作到了大众化，通俗化。第四，他们分散到各个战线（工业、农业、文卫、机关）各个角落（工地、食堂、田间、车间等），在各个时期，即使是在最繁忙的时期，都能机动灵活地进行教学。
    由浅入深，先普及而后提高
    “由浅入深，先普及而后提高”，是鲁山县委领导群众学哲学运动的一条成功经验。
    但是，对这个问题，开始也有两种不同的主张。一种主张从实际出发，做什么，学什么，先普及起来，而后再逐步提高；另一种主张从书本出发，拿书本上的原理套当前实际，以接受书本上的原理为唯一目的。县委针对这两种不同主张，一方面深入重点进行试验，一方面广泛组织群众开展大辩论。经过试讲和辩论，广大的干部和农民赞成第一种主张，反对第二种主张。
    县委根据广大干部和农民的要求，贯彻了由浅入深，在普及基础上提高，在提高指导下普及，以及普及与提高相结合的原则。在普及方面，采取了以下几种措施：一、召开电话会议，通过传播重点经验，强调各级党委必须加强对这一工作的具体领导。二、编印通俗的教材，办法是一方面宣传部编印，另方面推广下边好的教材。三、组织广播讲座，每星期一、四在县广播站向全县广播哲学。四、大讲董村牛运卿能给群众讲哲学等事实，来激发干部讲和群众学的积极性。这样就使群众学哲学运动在全县范围内很快地普及起来。
    县委为了使运动向平衡的方面发展，向共同提高的方面迈进，于10月4日在董村召开现场会议，通过参观、访问和座谈，总结和交流了普及与提高方面的经验，同时也检查了当前在提高方面所存在的问题。大家认为要提高就要作好以下几项工作：一，继续贯彻学习为生产服务、为政治斗争服务的方针，使学习与今冬明春的社会主义和共产主义教育紧密结合起来。二，不断总结检查工作，及时召开现场会议，总结交流工作经验，检查解决问题。三，训练教员，提高讲课质量，结合今冬明春的社会主义和共产主义教育运动，将已有的教师训练一遍。四，结合当前生产、工作和干群思想，编写比过去稍深一点的教材。五，加强党委对已有学习组织的领导，定期或不定期地听取汇报和检查学习情况。
    目前，全县的学哲学运动，正在向提高的方面发展。
