    Load and Overload
    Liu Feng
    Walking down a street, I saw some workers adding another floor to a completed building. This is indeed a good way to solve the housing shortage.
    Why can another floor be added to the building? Sometimes, it may be that the original design had some load capacity to spare, so it can handle more burden. It is certainly a good thing to make reasonable use of this spare capacity and have it serve the people. Sometimes, it may be that through effort, other conditions have been changed, so that the original roof structure, which seemed to have reached its load limit, has gained new load-bearing capacity. Thus, it is possible to add not only one floor, but also two floors or three to five floors.
    It's like this with building houses, and it's like this in other areas as well. For example, the railway's call in recent years for full load, over-axle weight, more loading, and faster running is also the result of utilizing the surplus capacity of equipment and creating new conditions.
    From this, our correct attitude towards load capacity should be: First: Oppose conservative load capacity. Conservative load capacity has too much spare capacity, which causes waste and is not in line with the principle of saving. Therefore, we must break superstitions, tap potential, and make it conform to or try to make it conform to the actual load level.
    Second: Advocate a scientific and honest attitude. That is to say, under certain conditions, a thing will have a certain load capacity. To not acknowledge this objective fact and blindly act, exceeding the actual load limit, will cause problems.
    Third: Our thinking cannot be rigid, and we cannot take this too literally. Therefore, for the sake of a greater leap forward, we should also work hard and cleverly, constantly creating new conditions for the original things, and new potential will appear. This is exactly the true color of a continuous revolutionary.
    So, what about people themselves?
    People are naturally not machines, because people have subjective initiative. But the load capacity of people also generally has certain laws. This year's nationwide Great Leap Forward has proved that people have given full play to their subjective initiative, daring to speak and daring to think. After daring to think, the capacity to spare is very large. Therefore, the Party calls on us to go all out and strive for the top. The soaring enthusiasm has greatly unleashed people's potential and wisdom, and many unprecedented miracles have appeared, demonstrating many noble spirits. However, after people have gone all out, they should pay attention to the fact that some people may overestimate their physical strength and ability, so they should be reminded not to force themselves to do things that they cannot handle. Some people may say: Isn't this discouraging? No, this is not discouraging. This is also a realistic attitude and an active attitude, the purpose of which is to ensure that people are more solid in their positions of building socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the preface to the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "...People's thinking must adapt to the changed circumstances. Of course, no one can engage in unfounded speculation, or plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not force themselves to do things that are really impossible." It would be beneficial to review this instruction for some comrades whose enthusiasm is so excessive that they disregard the normal load capacity.
    We must still go all out, we must still strive for the top, and we must still have a great leap forward next year. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee calls on us to have both soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of scientific analysis. We must give more play to wisdom and creativity, not only break through the conservative load capacity, but also increase the actual load capacity after creating new conditions.

    负荷和超负荷
    刘丰
    走过一条街，看到一些工人正在一个建成的大厦上又补加一层，这倒也是一个解决房屋不足的好办法。
    大厦之上为什么可以再补加一层呢？有时，可能是原来设计的负荷还有余裕，所以它还能多增加一些负担。合理地利用这种余裕，使它为人民来服务，当然是一件好事。有时，可能是经过努力，改变了其它条件，使原先看来负荷已经到顶了的屋架，又增加了新的负荷能力。于是，不仅可能加一层，也可能加两层或加个三层五层。
    盖房子是这样，别的方面也是这样。例如铁路上前几年提出过满载、超轴、多装、快跑，也是利用了设备的多余能力和创造了新的条件的结果。
    由此看来，我们对待负荷量的正确态度应该是：第一：反对保守的负荷量。保守的负荷量余裕太大，造成浪费，不合乎省的原则，所以一定要破除迷信，挖掘潜力，使之符合或尽量符合实际的负荷水平。
    第二：提倡科学的、老老实实的态度。这就是说，在一定条件下，一种东西是会有一定负荷量的。不承认这个客观事实，一味蛮干，超过实际负荷限度，就会产生毛病的。
    第三：我们的思想不能僵化，不能把这看得太死。所以为了更大的跃进，还应该实干加巧干，不断为原有的事物创设新的条件，这就会有新的潜力出现。这正是不断革命者应有的本色。
    那么，人本身又怎么样呢？
    人自然不是机械，因为人有主观能动性。但是人的负荷能力，也大体上有一定的规律。今年的全民大跃进，证明了人发挥了主观能动性，敢说敢想，敢想之后，能力的余裕是很大的。所以党号召我们鼓足干劲，力争上游。冲天干劲，使得人的潜力和智慧大大地发挥出来，出现了许多前所未有的奇迹，表现出许多崇高的精神。可是，当人们鼓足干劲以后，就要注意其中一部分人可能对自己的体力和能力，开始估计得过高了一些，于是就要提醒他们不要硬去做自己力不能胜任的事情。也许有人会说：这岂不是泄气吗？不，这不是泄气。这也是实事求是的态度，积极的态度，目的在于保证人们在建设社会主义的岗位上更坚实些。毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的序文中曾经指出：“……人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。”对于某些热情过分到不顾正常的负荷量的同志，重温一下这个指示是有好处的。
    干劲还是要鼓足，上游也还是要力争，明年也还要大跃进。党的六中全会号召我们既要有冲天的干劲，又要有科学分析的精神。我们就要更多地发挥智慧和创造性，不仅突破保守的负荷量，并且在创造了新的条件之后再提高实际的负荷量。
