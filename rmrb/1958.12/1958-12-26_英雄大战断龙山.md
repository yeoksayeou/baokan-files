    Heroes Battle Dragon-Breaking Mountain
    Tian Runzhang
    With great excitement, I introduce to you how the Party led the people of all ethnic groups to battle Dragon-Breaking Mountain.

    Dragon-Breaking Mountain is located in Tianjia and Qietong Townships in Guzhang County, Hunan. It is truly a wonderful place, inhabited by over 10,000 hardworking and brave Tujia people. Under the leadership of the Party, their lives are getting better day by day. It is truly: "Majestic mountains and ridges with beautiful scenery, tea and tung trees fragrant all over the mountains, thanks to the Party's good leadership, a happy life forever." However, due to the high terrain here, people suffer from a lack of water storage sources. Although many large and small ponds have been built since liberation, if it doesn't rain for ten days, even drinking water becomes a problem. How eagerly the Tujia people need water!

    However, on the cliff face of the towering Dragon-Breaking Mountain, there is a "hanging cave" from which a stream of water flows straight down the mountain. Could this water be utilized? How to utilize this water?

        Exploring the Hanging Cave
    In order to find the water source of the "hanging cave", on January 24th of this year, Township Party Secretary Huang Fuyao, Township Militia Captain Liang Qingguo, and four other comrades including myself, stepped on winter snow more than a foot deep and set off for Dragon-Breaking Mountain, over 1,000 meters above sea level.

    At the foot of Dragon-Breaking Mountain, looking up, it was truly "ten thousand feet of cliff, Dragon-Breaking Mountain, standing majestically in the clouds, a knife-cut cliff with no road, it is difficult to climb the mountain." Walking closer, we could only hear the sound of water "哗哗" rushing, but we didn't know where it was coming from. There was no road ahead, with cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right. What to do? Everyone looked at each other. Secretary Huang said: "We must learn the spirit of the warriors who outwitted Mount Hua to overcome difficulties. Climb!" Everyone responded: "Okay!" We took off our cotton coats, hooked our toes into the cracks in the rocks, and climbed up step by step, holding onto cogongrass. When we climbed halfway up the mountain, looking down at the high, steep cliffs, we were really scared, and our legs felt a little weak and trembling, feeling like we were hanging high on the mountainside. Suddenly, we heard Liang Qingguo shouting from above: "Come up quickly! I see the hanging cave! So much water!" After hearing this, everyone felt a surge of energy from nowhere, and suddenly their feet were steady and their bodies light, and they quickly climbed to the top of the mountain.

    We saw the hanging cave and also saw the water "哗哗" pouring down. However, after surveying, the water level was too low to be diverted to the hillside of Tianjia Township.

    For the second exploration of the hanging cave, we took another route - passing through mountains and ridges from Aimen to the top of the hanging cave entrance. The entrance of the hanging cave hung on the cliff halfway up the mountain, a dangerous cave that no one had ever dared to enter. We took off our cotton pants and braved the waterfall to force our way up. At the entrance of the cave, we held up torches and drilled into the deep cave, and a pool of water about one person deep and four meters wide appeared in front of us. Everyone took off all their clothes, jumped into the icy cold pool, and swam to the other side. We hooked our toes into the cracks in the rocks and climbed up a section of cliff; climbing up again, a narrow cave appeared; entering this cave, looking at the empty hall above, it was truly: "Arriving at a new cave dwelling, a different world", stalactites and stone pillars hanging upside down in mid-air, truly an endless natural beauty. We drilled through another narrow gorge before discovering the water source. It was estimated that the water source in this place could be raised about ten zhang higher than the water level at the cave entrance, making it entirely possible to divert the water to Qietong. Everyone felt unspeakable joy in their hearts.

    On February 1st, a water conservancy army of 700 people, holding high the red flag of "Marching to Dragon-Breaking Mountain, Bombarding the Hanging Cave River," marched mightily onto Dragon-Breaking Mountain.

    Great Battle in Ice and Snow

    The scale of water conservancy construction on Dragon-Breaking Mountain is extremely large. The water conservancy project is about sixty-five li long, mostly along cliffs. The main work areas have three dangerous passes: one is to dig a stone cave more than forty meters deep in the middle of the cliff and build a stone dam more than twenty meters high inside the cave; one is to split down the forty-meter-high cliff - Monkey Fort and Chang'an Mountain; and the other is to bypass the five-li-long Erka Mountain and Dragon-Breaking Mountain. Build fourteen large reservoirs, and also erect a two-hundred-meter-long aerial aqueduct. The entire project requires 650,000 labor days and a large amount of funds and equipment. Where does this come from? We adopted the method of self-reliance.

    The climate on Dragon-Breaking Mountain is very harsh, with frequent winter snow, torrential rain, strong winds, and heavy fog. It is truly: "Winter snow fills the mountains again, cold wind pierces the bones and chills through clothes, strong winds darken the sky, torrential rain wets clothes." How are the laborers working selflessly in the ice and snow? Here are two short stories.

    One day in March, it was raining heavily. On the hanging cave construction site, the cannon wiping cloth was wet and could not dry the gun bore, which was very difficult for the gunners. At this time, Communist Youth League member Liang Qingsheng, seeing this situation, unhesitatingly took off his cotton coat, "嘶" tore off the cuff of his cotton coat, and handed it to the gunner, saying: "Here, wipe the cannon." The other laborers were very moved. Tujia female Communist Youth League member Tian Ziying saw that the measuring team's tape measure was broken, and the technician was very anxious. Tian Ziying tore off the pocket of her floral dress, threaded the needle, and stitched the tape measure stitch by stitch. It seems that these are two small things, but they reflect a valuable idea.

      Great Battle of the Hanging Cave River

    On the night of June 22, we held a vow meeting to dig caves and build dams. At the meeting, the shock workers launched fierce challenges. Everyone asked to go to the most difficult work sections, and everyone expressed their determination to stubbornly complete the task ahead of schedule.

    That night, the shock workers went to attack the cave overnight, holding high the red flag. Only the sound of cannons booming, shaking the mountains and the ground, like a fierce battle. Every time the cannon stopped, Communist Youth League member Huang Feide braved the smoke to drill in and hit the rock. Branch Deputy Secretary Tian Jiayi also fought day and night with the laborers. When his malignant malaria attacked and he had to lie down, he still remembered attacking the cave. In order to shorten the construction period, an internal and external attack method was adopted. Township Head Peng Chuxiang and laborer Shi Zongbiao, in order to find the direction of digging the cave from the inside out, tried to climb the cliff and drilled into the empty hall to find the direction of digging the cave. Under the sky-high enthusiasm of these heroes, the project of tunneling the cave, which was originally planned to take two months, only took forty-seven days.

    Building a dam inside the cave is even more arduous. To build a stone dam more than twenty meters high in the dark cave, you must first drill into the water to clear the bottom sand before you can get a foothold, but the water in the cave is bone-chillingly cold. The heroes underwent another test. When the flood came, the barrel dam was washed away, and the heroes blocked it again; when the sand was filled, the heroes dug it again; once, twice, three times...Persist! Persist! Persist day and night! After more than three months of hard work, the stone dam project, which the engineer thought was unimaginable, was built by us.

    In early October, the people of Tianjia and Qietong townships established the Dragon-Breaking Mountain People's Commune. The commune members were full of enthusiasm, and the entire project progressed at a faster speed. Now, the hanging cave has been tunneled, the stone dam has been built, Monkey Fort has been leveled, and more than 100 meters of aerial aqueduct has been erected. It is estimated that it will be completed by next summer. At that time, a stream of happy spring water will continuously flow into the more than 20,000 mu of fields surrounding the mountain; two more hydropower stations will be built, and every household will be equipped with electric lights. We will also build rice mills and oil presses, using electricity to drive them. At that time, a very beautiful scene will appear.

    英雄大战断龙山
    田润章
    我怀着万分激动的心情，向你们介绍党是如何领导各族人民大战断龙山的。
    断龙山座落在湖南古丈县田家、茄通两乡，这里真是个好地方，居住着一万多勤劳勇敢的土家族人民。在党的领导下，他们的生活一天比一天好，真是：“崇山峻岭风光好，漫山遍野桐茶香，多亏党的好领导，幸福生活万年长。”但是，由于这里地势较高，人们苦于无蓄水之源。虽然解放后也修了不少的大小塘，可是，如果天晴十日不下雨，就连吃水也感困难。土家族人民是多么迫切需要水呵！
    但是，在那高耸的断龙山腰的峭壁上，却有一个“吊洞”，里面流出一股水直泻山下。是不是可以利用这股水？如何利用这股水？
        吊洞探险
    为了寻找“吊洞”的水源，今年1月24日，乡党委书记黄富耀、乡民兵队长梁庆国和我等四个同志，脚踏一尺多深的冬雪，向拔海一千多公尺的断龙山出发了。
    到了断龙山脚下，抬头一看，真是“万丈悬崖断龙山，巍峨屹立在云端，刀削绝壁无有路，要想上山难上难。”走到跟前，只听水声
  “哗哗”响，但是不知在何方。往前再走无路，左边是悬崖绝壁，右边也是悬崖绝壁。怎么办？大家面面相觑，黄书记说道：“我们要学智取华山的勇士们克服困难的精神。爬山！”大家应声：“好！”我们脱掉了棉衣，脚尖扣住石缝，手攀芭茅，一步一步地往上移动。当我们爬到半山腰时，往下一看，高悬的陡壁峭崖，心里着实害怕，两条腿也有些发软打颤，觉得高挂在半山腰直晃荡。忽然听到上边梁庆国喊道：“快上来啊！看到吊洞啦！好大的水呀！”大家听到后，不知哪儿来了一股猛劲，一下子脚稳身轻，飞快地爬上了山峰。
    我们看到了吊洞，也看到了“哗哗”直泻的水。但是经过勘测，水位太低，不能引上田家乡的山坡。
    第二次探吊洞，我们采取了另外一条路——从艾门穿山过岭转到吊洞口上面。吊洞洞口吊在半腰的绝壁上，是从来无人敢进的险洞。我们脱下棉裤，顶着瀑布硬往上闯。到了洞口，我们高举火把钻进了深洞，前边出现了一个大约有一人多深四公尺宽的水潭。大家脱掉全身的衣服，跳进冰凉刺骨的深潭，游到了对岸。脚尖扣住石缝，又爬上了一段绝壁；再往上爬，出现了一个窄洞；进了这个洞，到上边空堂一看，真是：“乍到新洞府，别有一块天”，石笋、石柱倒悬半空，真是观不尽的天然美景。我们又钻过了一道窄峡，才发现水源。估计这地方的水源比洞口水位可提高十丈左右，完全可能把水引到茄通，大家心里真有说不尽的高兴。
    2月1日，一支七百人组成的水利大军，高举着“向断龙山进军，向吊洞河开炮”的红旗，浩浩荡荡地开上了断龙山。
    冰天雪地大战
    断龙山水利建设的规模是非常巨大的。水利工程全长约六十五华里，沿途多是悬崖绝壁，最主要的工区就有三道险关：一道是在绝壁半腰凿四十多公尺深的石洞，并在洞内筑起二十多公尺的石坝；一道是要劈下四十多公尺的悬崖——猴儿堡和长安山；还有一道是绕过五里长的二卡山和断龙山。修建大型的水库十四座，还要在空中架二百多公尺长的天枧。全部工程需六十五万个劳动日，需要大量的资金和器材，这些从哪儿来呢？我们采取自力更生的办法。
    断龙山气候非常恶劣，时而冬雪纷纷，时而大雨倾盆，时而狂风大作，时而雾气沉沉，这真是：“冬雪纷纷复满山，冷风刺骨透衣寒，狂风大作天昏暗，大雨倾盆湿衣衫”。民工们怎样在冰天雪地中忘我地劳动着？这里讲两个小故事。
    3月的一天，天下着大雨，在吊洞工地上，擦炮布都湿了，无法擦干炮眼，炮手很为难。这时共青团员梁清生，看到这种情况，毫不犹豫地脱下了棉衣，“嘶”的一声，撕下了棉衣袖口，递给炮手说：“给你擦炮去。”其他民工很受感动。土家族女共青团员田子英，看到测量队的皮尺断了，技术员很着急，田子英把自己一件花衣服的口袋撕了下来，穿上针，引上线，一针一针地把皮尺缝好。看来，这两件都是小事情，但是却反映了一种可贵的思想。
      大战吊洞河
    6月22日的夜里，我们召开了凿洞筑坝誓师大会。会上突击手们展开了激烈的挑战，人人都要求到最艰难的工段去，人人都表示要顽强地提前完成任务。
    当夜突击手高举红旗连夜攻洞去了。只听得炮声轰轰，山摇地动，像一场激烈的战斗。共青团员黄费得每次都是当炮声一停，就冒着烟钻进去打岩。支部副书记田家义也和民工一道日夜苦战，当他恶性疟疾发作不得不躺下的时候，还念念不忘攻洞。为了缩短工程日期，采取内外夹攻的办法，乡长彭楚祥和民工史宗标，为了寻找从内往外攻的凿洞方向，设法爬上了绝壁，钻进了空堂，探得了凿洞的方向。就在这些英雄们的冲天干劲下，原计划两个月凿通洞子的工程，只用了四十七天。
    洞内筑坝，更为艰巨。要在漆黑的岩洞中，筑起二十多公尺的石坝，首先必须钻进水里清出底沙才好下脚，但是洞里的水是刺骨的寒冷。英雄们又经受了一次考验。大水来了，把筒坝冲垮了，英雄们再堵；沙堵满了，英雄们再挖；一次、二次、三次……坚持！坚持！日夜坚持！苦战了三个多月，工程师认为不堪设想的石坝工程，被我们筑起来了。
    10月初，田家与茄通两乡人民成立了断龙山人民公社。公社社员们干劲冲天，整个工程更以飞快的速度进展。现在，吊洞凿通了，石坝筑起来了，猴儿堡削平了，已架了一百多公尺的天枧，估计明年夏天可以全部竣工。到那时，一股幸福的泉水将源源不断地流到那环山的二万多亩田里；再修两个水电站，户户装上电灯，还要建设碾米厂、油榨坊，用电来带动。到那时将会出现一幅非常美丽的景象。
