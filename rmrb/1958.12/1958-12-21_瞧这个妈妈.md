　　It was already dark, and Xiuzhen was sitting in the house restlessly, not even turning on the light. She was worrying about her child again. When she was a young woman, she was a production expert. After getting married, she was tied down by the child and couldn't go to the fields, which made her scold her husband all day long. Fortunately, the commune was established soon after, and canteens and nurseries were set up, so she could be active in the fields again. But she really struggled with sending her child to the nursery. If she sent him, the child was only two years old and couldn't fully take care of himself. There were so many children in the nursery, how could the caregivers take care of him as carefully as a mother would her own child? She was afraid he would be wronged and suffer! If she didn't send him, there would be no one at home, she couldn't concentrate on working in the fields during the day, and she couldn't go out for evening studies. After calculating and considering, production and study were important, and seeing that her neighbors were happily sending their children, she finally made up her mind to send him as well. Sure enough, within four days, production and study had greatly improved. But she also missed her child very much and couldn't sleep well at night. She couldn't find time to see her child during the day or night, so one dark night she secretly got up, crossed two mountain slopes, and ran to the nursery. Before anyone opened the door, she climbed in through the window and pulled her child out of the warm quilt and took him home. When her husband woke up and saw, he shouted, "Are you still going to work in the fields tomorrow? You'll be laughed at! What's wrong with the child being there?" After much persuasion, they sent the child back to the nursery together. The child didn't sleep well all night because of the fuss, and almost caught a cold.

　　Tonight, her husband went to the county for a meeting and wouldn't be back. Xiuzhen returned home from studying, but couldn't settle down, and finally locked the door and went straight to the nursery.

　　This time it wasn't too late, and the nursery door wasn't closed yet. She slipped inside, and it was quiet inside. She assumed the children were all asleep, but the lights were still on. She leaned against the window, squinted, and peered through the crack. She saw a dozen or so children sleeping comfortably on the wide east-side kang, each covered with a small quilt, with only their heads exposed, their little faces looking sweet in their sleep. Her child was sleeping on the west-side kang, but was blocked from view by the back of an auntie. The auntie was leaning over, gently tucking the children in. When the auntie walked away, Xiuzhen almost screamed. Her child's place was empty! The child was gone, leaving only a small, half-turned quilt.

　　Xiuzhen was flustered and about to push the door open to inquire, but was suddenly patted on the shoulder and her arm was grabbed. Xiuzhen was startled and couldn't see clearly who it was in the dark, but she heard a quiet voice whispering in her ear, "Xiuzhen, are you here to steal your child again?" Xiuzhen blushed, and at the same time recognized that it was the women's director. Xiuzhen knew that the women's director was the best person, and although she was over fifty years old, she was still actively taking the lead in all kinds of work. She was originally a Party branch committee member because she best understood the psychology of women and was willing to help them solve difficulties. The women were also most willing to talk to her about their private matters and ask her to solve their problems, so everyone elected her as the women's director. But what was she doing here now? She didn't have any young children in the nursery; her three children had already grown up. Xiuzhen was suspicious, but didn't have time to ask, and urgently said her own matter: "Oh, Director, this time I just came to see my child, I didn't want to take him back, but the child is gone!" The women's director asked in surprise, "Gone?"
　　"Not sleeping on the kang!" "Oh!" The director also peeked through the crack in the window and comforted her, "Don't go in yet, you'll startle the children. Maybe he's somewhere else! Let's go to the office and ask." As soon as she finished speaking, a few cries from a child came from the opposite room. Xiuzhen didn't have time to distinguish, cried "Ah," fiercely broke free from the director's hand, immediately rushed into the opposite room, and anxiously called out repeatedly: "Good child, good child, what's wrong, what's wrong, Mom is here..."

　　This room was smaller, with only one child and one auntie in it. The child was indeed crying, and the auntie was holding him and walking back and forth to coax him. Xiuzhen rushed up and was about to take the child, the auntie was stunned, and tightly hugged the child and took a step back, saying: "Sister Xiuzhen, what are you doing? This is not your child!" Xiuzhen looked carefully and indeed it wasn't, and she was also stunned, and asked: "Then where is my child?" "Isn't he in the opposite room?" "No!" The two were arguing when they heard someone outside the door say: "Here he is, here he is." Several people came in, the women's director, and another auntie holding Xiuzhen's child.

　　Xiuzhen took the child, kissed him, and before she could ask, the women's director said with a smile: "I've inquired about everything. The child needed to poop shortly after going on the kang, and the auntie took him together, and he just finished. He's fine, nothing happened." Xiuzhen couldn't speak, carefully looked at the child, and kept kissing his little face. The child spoke: "Mom, Mom, the little friends are waiting for me, I want to sleep, I'm not going back, it's good here, you come and play."

　　After staying with the child for a while, Xiuzhen and the women's director walked out of the nursery together. The women's director held her arm, and kindly blamed her: "Ah, look at you, this mom, always not trusting people, afraid that people will mistreat your child. How would you know, they are more careful than you are when you take care of him yourself. I am entrusted by the Party branch to come and check every day, and help solve some problems. These are all good girls, they couldn't treat the children any better, really nothing to say. Like that child crying just now, it's because he was just sent here today and isn't used to it, so a special auntie is taking care of him, afraid that he'll be unfamiliar with the other children, and afraid that the other children will be woken up by his crying. You, ah, not only don't thank them, but you're still repeatedly suspicious and breaking in, you're the most special of all the moms." These words made Xiuzhen full of shame. The women's director quickly comforted her, and excitedly talked about the future prospects of the nursery: buying furniture, expanding the grounds, and sending aunties to the county's teacher training classes in turn... Listening to this, Xiuzhen also became excited, tightly held the women's director, and said repeatedly: "I, I'm really relieved. I, I should also do my best to help them!"

　　The sky was full of stars, a gentle breeze was blowing, and two women, tightly holding each other's arms, whispering to each other, went away into the distance.

    瞧这个妈妈
    苏晓平
    天已落黑，秀珍在屋里坐立不定，连灯也不点。她是又牵挂起孩子来了。做姑娘的时候，她原是生产能手。结婚以后给孩子缠住，下不了地，急得她整天骂丈夫。幸亏不久成立了公社，办起了食堂、托儿所，她才重新能够活跃在地里。可是送孩子入托儿所那阵，她着实犯难。送呢，孩子才两岁多，还不能完全料理自己的生活，托儿所孩子那末多，保育员哪能像妈妈对亲生孩子一样照管周到，怕不要委屈糟死了才算！不送呢，屋里没人，白天下地不放心，晚上学习出不去。算来盘去，生产学习要紧，又见左邻右舍都高高兴兴地送孩子去了，这才横了心也送去了。只不过四天，生产、学习上果然大有起色了。可是想孩子也想得紧，夜里睡不安。白天和晚上抽不出功夫去看孩子，一次黑天半夜里偷偷爬起来，越过二道山坡，奔到托儿所。没等到人家开门，她就从窗户里翻进去，把孩子从热被窝里拉出来抱回家了。丈夫醒来看见，喝道：“你明早还下地不？看给人家笑话！孩子在那里有啥不好？”横劝竖劝，才一起送孩子回了托儿所。孩子给折腾得一夜没睡好不说，还差点儿着了凉。
    今夜丈夫去县里开会回不来了。秀珍学习回家，再也安不下心，终于把门一锁，直奔托儿所而去。
    这回还不太晚，托儿所门还没关。她掩身进去，里面静悄悄的，想必孩子们都睡下了，可是屋里还亮着灯。她就贴到窗边，眯起眼睛，从窗缝里张望。只见东面炕上宽宽舒舒横睡着十来个孩子，各自盖着小被，只露出个头，小脸一张张都睡得甜蜜蜜地。她孩子是睡在西面炕上的，可是这时给一个阿姨的背影挡住了看不见。那阿姨伏着身子，正轻轻地在给孩子们盖严被子。等阿姨走过去，秀珍几乎惊叫起来。她孩子睡的地方竟是空的！孩子不见了，只剩下一条小被半翻着。
    秀珍心慌意乱，正要推门进屋查问，不料突然被人拍了一记肩膀，随着胳膊也给拉住了。秀珍吓了一跳，暗中看不真切是谁，耳畔却响起了一个压低了嗓门的轻轻说话声：“秀珍呀，敢莫是又偷孩子来了？”秀珍脸一红，同时听出是妇女主任。秀珍知道，妇女主任人最好，五十多岁了，还样样工作积极带头干。她原是党支部委员，因她最是摸透妇女们心理，肯为她们排除困难，妇女们也最乐意找她谈谈私房话，请她解决疑难，所以大家又选了她当妇女主任。可是这阵子她来干什么呀？她又没有小孩子在托儿所，她三个孩子早已长成大人了。秀珍心下怀疑，但是顾不及发问，要紧说自己的事：“啊呀主任呀，这回我只是来看看孩子的，没想抱回去，可是孩子不见了呀！”妇女主任诧异地反问：“怎么不见了？”
  “没睡在炕上呀！”“哦！”主任也从窗缝里张了张，安慰说：“你先别进去，看惊吵了孩子们。许是在别的什么地方吧！咱们上办公室问问去。”一语刚完，对面屋里传来了几声孩子啼哭声。秀珍不暇细辨，“啊”了一声，猛的摔脱主任的手，立时冲进了对面屋子，气急败坏地连声呼唤：“乖孩乖孩，怎么了怎么了，妈来了……。”
    这屋较小，只有一个孩子和一位阿姨在。孩子确在啼哭，阿姨正抱着他哄着来回走动。秀珍抢上去就要把孩子抱过来，阿姨怔了一怔，紧抱着孩子退回一步，说：“秀珍姐，你干啥？这不是你的孩子呀！”秀珍定睛一看，果真不是，倒也怔住了，就问：“那末我的孩子呢？”“不是在对面屋里吗？”“没有呀！”两人正缠不清楚，却听门外说道：“来了来了。”进来几个人，妇女主任，另一个阿姨抱着秀珍的孩子。
    秀珍接过孩子，亲着，未及问话，妇女主任笑嘻嘻地说了：“我全打听了。孩子上炕不久要拉屎，阿姨抱着一起去了，这会才拉完。好好儿的，什么事也没有。”秀珍说不出话来，仔细端详着孩子，不住亲他小脸。孩子倒说话了：“妈妈妈妈，小朋友等着我哩，我要睡了，我不回，这里好，你来玩玩好了。”
    和孩子盘桓了一阵，秀珍就和妇女主任一块走出了托儿所。妇女主任挽着她，亲切地埋怨道：“唉，瞧你这个妈妈，总不放心人家，生怕人家委屈了你孩子，你哪知道，人家比你自己带的还细心。我受党支部委托，天天来查看，帮着解决些问题。这都是些好姑娘，待孩子再好也没有了，真没说的。就如刚才那孩子啼哭，是因为今天才送来，还不习惯，就专门由一个阿姨带他，怕他和大伙孩子在一起陌生，也怕大伙孩子被他哭醒。你呐，嗨，不感谢她们还罢了，还几番疑心疑惑闯来，妈妈里头就数你特别。”一席话，说得秀珍满心惭愧。妇女主任又忙安慰她，并且兴奋地谈起了托儿所的远景：置办家具，扩充园地，轮流派阿姨上县的教养员培训班学习……。听得秀珍也兴奋起来，紧紧挽住妇女主任，连声说道：“我，我真的放心了。我，我也该怎么的给她们出把力才好！”
    满天繁星，微风轻拂，两个妇女紧挽着，喁喁细语，远去了。
