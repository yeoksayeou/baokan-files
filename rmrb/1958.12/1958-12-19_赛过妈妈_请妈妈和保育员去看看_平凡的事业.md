    Better Than Mom
    — Invite Mothers and Nursery Workers to See "An Ordinary Undertaking"
    Su Fang
    I don't know how many mothers mention the words "nursery worker" with grateful and respectful hearts. It is they who have freed themselves from the burden of their children; it is they who diligently nurture their beloved little ones. Then, mothers must be willing to watch the movie "An Ordinary Undertaking," because it is about nursery workers, about their ordinary but great work. In the film, when you see the admirable Director Lu, you will surely feel great joy. Although her face is different from the aunties you are familiar with, doesn't her deep love for children resemble Aunt Zhang or Aunt Li, whom you trust? Director Lu, what a bright heart she has! She was once a brave soldier in the Eighth Route Army, and today, in peaceful times, she is working diligently to cultivate successors to communism! Honghong cried when she first left her mother, and Director Lu built blocks with her to make her happy; when Honghong and Xiaohui quarreled over a ball, Director Lu came up with a way to mediate the dispute. You will praise her for understanding child psychology so well, but that is not the most important thing. What makes people even more respectful and admire her is her love for children and her high sense of responsibility towards her work. Children are like tender buds just emerging from the soil, and they need gardeners to carefully cultivate the soil and diligently irrigate them so that they can grow into strong pillars, so that they can bloom with wonderful flowers and lush greenery. Director Lu and millions of nursery workers are engaged in this arduous and glorious work, they are the diligent gardeners, they are the people who assume the dual responsibilities of mothers and mentors, people who are better than mothers.
    Of course, not everyone sees this, and even some people who do nursery work do not understand this principle. Many young girls, after stepping out of the school gate and out of the house, are filled with joy and high-flying fantasies. They attempt to show their talents in "promising" careers and make a big splash; but for nursery work, they think it is a trivial matter, a meaningless job of serving children. Even the simple and sincere Lin Peiming in the film has this view, not to mention the superficial young girl Li Juan. However, Director Lu educated them, the good comrades around them educated them, and life itself also educated them. Only when the aunties take good care of the children can Honghong's mother, that excellent female worker, be able to concentrate on production. Doesn't this concrete fact illustrate the importance of nursery work? Honghong and Beibei are both innocent and naive children, but one is so modest and polite under the auntie's beneficial guidance, while the other is so unruly and mischievous under the mother's pampering and indulgence. Doesn't this concrete fact show the importance of nursery work? They have changed, especially Lin Peiming, who has become so passionate about her work and become a nursery worker who is better than mom! Mothers will understand her feelings, will love her, respect her; and for those nursery workers who are not at ease with their work, can't they also get inspiration and learn lessons from her transformation!
    That's why I say that mothers and nursery workers should go and see "An Ordinary Undertaking." This is not to say that this film is particularly good, because although the director skillfully used many natural actors—children, whose rich expressions and innocent smiles touched our hearts so much, the thinness of the story content and the forced and stiff plot are still relatively obvious. However, the theme and subject matter of the film are indeed of practical significance today, when millions of women are being liberated from household labor and when nursery undertakings are being vigorously developed.

    赛过妈妈
    ——请妈妈和保育员去看看“平凡的事业”
    苏方
    不知有多少母亲怀着感激的、崇敬的心情提到“保育员”这三个字。是她们，把自己从孩子的拖累中解放了出来；是她们，尽心地抚育着自己心疼的小宝贝。那么，母亲们一定乐意看看“平凡的事业”这部电影，因为它正是写保育员的，正是写她们平凡而又伟大的工作的。在影片里面，你们在看到可敬的陆主任时，一定会引起很大的喜悦。虽然她的面孔和你们熟悉的阿姨的不一样，然而她对孩子的深切的爱，不正像你们所信托的张阿姨或者李阿姨么？陆主任，她有着一颗多么明亮的心！她曾经是八路军中的英勇的战士，今天，在和平的日子里，她又在为培育共产主义的接班人而勤奋地工作了！刚离开妈妈的红红哭了，陆主任和她搭积木逗她乐；红红和小辉争皮球闹起来了，陆主任想出办法来调解了纠纷。你们会称赞她是多么懂得儿童心理的人，然而，这还不是最主要的。使人更为尊敬景仰她的，是她对于孩子的热爱和对待工作的高度的责任心。儿童像刚出土的嫩芽儿一样，必需园丁精心地培土，勤劳地浇灌，才能长成结实的栋梁之材，才能奇花怒放，绿叶成荫。陆主任和千百万个保育工作者，正从事着这艰巨而又光荣的工作，正是这辛勤的园丁，正是承担了母亲和导师的双重职责的赛过妈妈的人。
    自然，并不是所有的人都看到这点，甚至连有些做保育工作的人也还不懂得这个道理。许多年青姑娘，踏出了学校门、踏出了家门后，怀着满腔的喜悦，抱着天高的幻想。企图在“有作为”的事业里大显身手，轰轰烈烈地干一场；而对于保育工作，她们却认为是微不足道的小事，是侍候孩子的无意义的工作。影片里连朴素真挚的林培明都有这种看法，更别说那浮华的少女李娟了。但是，陆主任教育了她们，周围的好同志教育了她们，生活本身也教育了她们。只有阿姨们把孩子带好，红红的母亲，那个优秀的女工，才能安心生产，这具体的事实，不是说明了保育工作的重要么？红红和贝贝同样是天真无邪的孩子，然而，一个在阿姨的有益的教导下，是那样谦让有礼，一个在母亲的娇惯放纵下，却那样胡闹调皮，这具体的事实，不正显示出保育工作的重要么？她们变了，特别是林培明，变得那样热爱自己的工作，成为一个赛过妈妈的保育员了！母亲们会谅解她的心情，会喜爱她，尊重她；而不安心工作的保育员们，从她的转变中，不是也可以得到启示和接受教训么！
    所以我说，母亲们和保育员们应该去看看“平凡的事业”。这倒不是说这部影片特别好，因为导演虽然巧妙地运用了很多自然演员——孩子们，他们的丰富的表情和天真的微笑是那样触动了我们的心，然而故事内容单薄和情节牵强生硬之处还是比较明显的。不过，影片的主题和题材，在今天，在千百万妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，在大力发展保育事业的时候，确是有现实意义的。
