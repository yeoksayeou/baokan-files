Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 15th: The workers of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant are launching a mass movement to complete sets of machines, ensuring the rapid support of brother factories and mines such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company with large quantities of complete sets of equipment. As of the end of November, they have manufactured more than 12,400 tons of various types of complete machine equipment, including rolling mills, hydraulic presses, cranes, and excavators. The complete sets of machine products for December will also be delivered on time.

In the past, due to shortcomings in the production organization work of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, the upper and lower processes were not connected enough, and it was often discovered during assembly that some small parts were missing. Many products were dragging their "tails" and could not be quickly completed. In response to this situation, the factory party committee held a meeting of activists from the entire factory and decided to use a mass movement to change this situation. The meeting proposed that in December, the completion of national complete sets of products should be guaranteed first. The roughing, casting, forging, processing, and assembly processes were all arranged with complete sets of machine products as the center. A shock campaign was launched to produce missing parts for complete sets of products, striving to complete more complete sets of machine products.

The joint processing workshop, which is responsible for manufacturing the "950" rolling mill, first reformed the method of issuing plans. The plan was arranged with assembly as the center, and the parts were manufactured according to the needs of assembly. Then, the progress of the parts was used to urge the roughing and tools. This greatly changed the passive situation of assembly. The workers of the assembly team proposed to be promoters of the completion of the rolling mill and would never sit and wait for parts. If the roughing could not be delivered, they would directly contact the roughing workshop. If problems occurred, they would actively contact the design and inspection departments.

In order to manufacture a 275-ton overhead crane for Anshan Iron and Steel in a timely manner, the workers of the preparation section formed a shock team responsible for cutting off the "tail" of this crane, and completed the preparation work for the 275-ton overhead crane. The assembly workers then organized a shock team to rush the assembly. The welding group and the odd-job group also cooperated very closely, doing the welding wherever it was assembled. In addition to cooperating with the assembly, the preparation section also cut off the "tails" of 20 other products in two and a half days, creating good conditions for the completion of the products.

All the workers of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant have exerted great energy and are going all out to reverse the situation of incomplete equipment. The workers of the steel casting workshop have already formulated a plan to increase steel production, requiring that the roughing materials required for complete sets of machine products can be fully supplied. The workers of the joint processing workshop are also actively tapping the potential of mechanical processing to process more machine products.

### 用成套设备支援兄弟厂  太原重型机器厂大搞群众运动

    用成套设备支援兄弟厂
    太原重型机器厂大搞群众运动
    新华社太原15日电  太原重型机器厂职工正在掀起一个使机器成套的群众运动，保证迅速以大批的成套设备支援鞍钢、太原钢铁公司等兄弟厂矿。到11月底为止，他们已经制造出一万二千四百多吨各种类型的成套机器设备，其中有轧钢机、水压机、起重机和挖掘机等。12月份的成套机器产品也将做到按时交货。
    太原重型机器厂过去一度由于生产组织工作上存在着缺点，上下工序不够衔接，常常在装配的时候才发现缺少某些小零件，许多产品拖着“尾巴”，不能迅速成套。针对这种情况，工厂党委会召开了全厂活动分子会议，决定用大搞群众运动的方法来改变这种情况。会上提出12月份首先要保证国家成套产品的完成，毛坯、铸锻、加工和装配等各个环节上，都以成套机器产品为中心进行安排，突击成套产品缺件，力争完成更多的成套机器产品。
    负责制造“九五○”轧钢机的联合加工车间，他们首先改革了下达计划的办法，以装配为中心，安排了计划，根据装配的需要，安排零件的制造，然后根据零件进度督促毛坯和工具，这样就大大改变了装配的被动局面。装配小组的工人们提出要当轧钢机成套的促进派，决不坐着等零件。毛坯来不了，他们就到毛坯车间直接联系，发生问题就主动找设计部门和检验部门联系。
    为了及时地为鞍钢制造二百七十五吨行车，准备工段工人组成负责割这台行车“尾巴”的突击队，突击完成了二百七十五吨行车的准备工作；装配工人们接着组织突击队突击装配。电焊组、零活组也配合得非常紧密，做到了装到那里，焊到那里。准备工段除了配合装配以外，还在两天半的时间内，割掉了其他二十种产品的“尾巴”，为产品成套创造了良好的条件。
    太原重型机器厂全厂职工都发挥了很大的干劲，全力以赴地扭转器不成套的局面。铸钢车间职工已经订出提高钢产量的计划，要求使成套机器产品所需的毛坯材料能够充分供应。联合加工车间职工也积极挖掘机械加工潜力，多加工机器产品。
