Xinhua News Agency Report: The annual winter hairtail fishing season has arrived at the Zhoushan fishing grounds in Zhejiang Province. This year, the first hairtail fishing season after the establishment of the People's Communes is larger in scale than any previous year. More than 24,000 fishing boats from People's Communes in coastal Zhejiang, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian and other provinces have gathered at the Shengshan fishing grounds, and more than 5 million catties of hairtail have been caught so far. Fresh hairtail is being transported to cities such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, as well as rural markets, to supply public canteens and meet the needs of residents.

This year's hairtail fishing season in Zhoushan fishing grounds has seen "five mores": more fishermen, more fishing boats, more fishing gear, more women, and more cadres going to sea. After the People's Communes in various fishing areas implemented militarized organization, collectivized living, combat-oriented action, and democratized management, labor efficiency has been greatly improved. Therefore, while focusing on steel and agriculture, the number of fishermen going to sea has also greatly increased compared to the past.

    舟山带鱼汛到了
    据新华社讯  浙江省舟山渔场又到了一年一度的冬季带鱼汛期。今年人民公社化后的第一个带鱼汛，规模比过去任何一年都大，来自浙江沿海和辽宁、山东、江苏、福建等省人民公社的二万四千多条渔船，云集嵊山渔场，目前已捕到带鱼五百多万斤。新鲜的带鱼正源源运到上海、杭州等城市和农村市场，供应公共食堂和居民需要。
    今年舟山渔场带鱼汛中出现了“五多”：渔民多、渔船多、渔具多、妇女多、干部下海多。各渔区人民公社实行组织军事化、生活集体化、行动战斗化、管理民主化以后，劳动效率大大提高，因此在大抓钢铁和农业的同时，出海渔民还比过去大为增加。
