The South Korean farce becomes increasingly foul.
Fascist bill passed through violence in National Assembly
Opposition party members dragged out and beaten

(Dispatch from this newspaper) South Korea has long been used by the United States as a showcase of the "free world," but the goods in this showcase have long been notorious. Recently, the Lee Seung-man group staged an absurd farce to prove how disgusting American-style "democracy" is.

According to reports from Seoul: On the 24th, the Lee Seung-man group dispatched 300 fully armed policemen to beat up about 70 members of the opposition Democratic Party and drag them all out of the National Assembly hall. Then, the Liberal Party members of Lee Seung-man "unanimously passed" the amendment to the "National Security Law" proposed by the Lee Seung-man government.

After the Lee Seung-man group submitted this fascist bill to the National Assembly on November 18, it was strongly opposed by people from all walks of life in South Korea. They believed that this bill would further deprive them of their political freedom and freedom of speech, making South Korea a police "state." Members of the opposition Democratic Party also expressed their opposition. Since December 19, they had been holding a sit-in in the National Assembly hall to oppose the Lee Seung-man group's attempt to force the National Assembly to pass this bill. Lee Seung-man's followers had twice beaten Democratic Party members who were resisting in the National Assembly.

The farce on the 24th was staged as follows: The Lee Seung-man group dispatched a large number of police to surround the National Assembly and cut off traffic around the "National Assembly." Then, the Democratic Party members were dragged and beaten into the National Assembly lounge. Then, Han Hee-suk, the vice-speaker of the Liberal Party, announced the meeting, and 128 Liberal Party members raised their hands to "pass" the amendment, which took only fifteen minutes. Subsequently, these Liberal Party followers unanimously "passed" the Lee Seung-man government's next fiscal year's budget and the amendment to the "Local Autonomy Law." William Jones, First Secretary of the U.S. Embassy in South Korea, was the only foreign "witness" to the farce. Indeed:

　　Lee Seung-man's followers beat people up,
　　American diplomats nod frequently.

### 南朝鲜丑剧愈演愈臭  在国会中用暴力通过法西斯法案  反对党议员被连拖带打赶出会场

    南朝鲜丑剧愈演愈臭
    在国会中用暴力通过法西斯法案
    反对党议员被连拖带打赶出会场
    本报讯  南朝鲜长期以来是被美国当作是“自由世界”的橱窗的，但是这个橱窗内的货色，早就臭名远扬了。最近李承晚集团又用一出荒唐透顶的丑剧来证明所谓美式的“民主”是何等的令人作呕。
    据汉城消息：李承晚集团24日出动了三百名全副武装的警察，把反对党民主党的约七十名议员加以毒打后全部拖出国会会场，然后由李承晚的自由党议员“一致通过”了李承晚政府提出的“国家保安法”修正案。
    李承晚集团在11月18日向国会提出这个法西斯法案后，曾经遭到南朝鲜各界人民的强烈反对，他们认为，这项法案将进一步剥夺他们的政治自由和言论自由，使南朝鲜成为警察“国家”。反对党民主党的议员也表示反对，他们从12月19日起一直在国会会场中举行静坐斗争反对李承晚集团企图强使国会通过这项法案，李承晚分子曾经两次在国会中殴打进行抵制的民主党议员。
    24日的丑剧是这样演出的：李承晚集团出动大批警察包围了国会，并且在“国会”周围断绝了交通。然后把民主党的议员连拖带打地全部关进了国会休息室中，于是自由党的副议长韩熙锡就宣布开会，由一百二十八名自由党议员举手“通过”了这个修正案，前后一共只用了十五分钟的时间。随后，这些自由党的党徒们又一致“通过”了李承晚政府下一财政年度的预算案和“地方自治法”修正案。丑剧上演的时候，美国驻南朝鲜大使馆一等秘书威廉·琼斯是唯一的外国“目击者”。正是：
    李承晚分子大打出手
    美国外交官频频点头
