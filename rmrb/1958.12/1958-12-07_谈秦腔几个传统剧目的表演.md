    Talking about the Performance of Several Traditional Qin腔 Operas
    Mei Yinfang
    We are very pleased to see the performances of the Shaanxi Province Opera Troupe's First, Second, and Third Troupes in the capital. This is not only because their plays are good, but also because these operas were combined with the revolutionary movement very early on, becoming a powerful weapon of revolutionary struggle, which has made people develop a deep affection for them. Now, I would like to talk about my impressions of several Qin腔 operas I have seen.
      "Three Drops of Blood" is a good play against subjectivism. Through a story of joys and sorrows, it illustrates the mistakes of violating science and believing in books. Fan Xinmin's creation of Jin Xinshu fully expresses the stubborn thoughts of an old scholar in feudal society who is inflexible and dogmatic and relies solely on books. Comrade Ma Shaobo said at a symposium that this play is the "Fifteen Strings of Cash" of Qin腔, which is a very good way of putting it. However, I think it is too rigid. Although Guo Yuzhi and Jin Xinshu are both typical subjectivists, they have different ingenious features in terms of character design. Guo Yuzhi is portrayed as a handsome figure, while Jin Xinshu is portrayed as an ugly figure. Zhu Guoliang's portrayal of Guo Yuzhi created a character image that conforms to the unique style of Su Kun Opera, while Fan Xinmin gave full play to the characteristics of Qin腔's traditional robed clown, eliminating vulgar performances with low-level taste. In this play, Liu Yuzhong's performance of Zhou Renrui, an old man who is distraught after losing his son, deeply moved the audience with those few gestures. He is an excellent old actor of the "衰派" (decline) acting school. Xiao Ruolan, Chen Miaohua, Lei Zhenzhong, and others all performed well, and we are very familiar with their performing arts. The young actress Quan Qiaomin's Jia Lianxiang was the first time I saw her, and the image of this bright and lively girl she created left a deep impression on me.
    "Visiting the West Lake" is very popular. Li Huiniang is not only a woman who is insulted and harmed, but also a vengeful ghost. Ma Lanyu, who plays Li Huiniang, portrays Huiniang's grief and anger and kind character in the "Ghost's Lament" scene with her weeping singing and agile and light dancing. During the "Saving Life" scene, Ma Lanyu and Li Jizu, who plays Pei Sheng, successfully used traditional techniques such as hair-swinging, fire-breathing, and tumbling to express their nervous mood when they were in a precarious situation. Because Ma Lanyu has mastered the fire-breathing technique skillfully, it is closely combined with the plot and is not just a show of skill. Huiniang's rage and her heroic resistance to Jia Sidao are reflected in the performance of spitting flames at Liao Yin. This is inseparable from Luo Siku's performance of Liao Yin. Of course, if the fire-breathing technique is further combined with Huiniang covering Pei Sheng's escape and depicting her using fire to force back Liao Yin's pursuit, then fire-breathing can better show the tension of the atmosphere and help with Huiniang's character depiction. The following "Ghost Debate" scene elevates Huiniang's image to a peak of heroism and integrity. Jia Sidao is not only a ruler who oppresses the people, but he dares to interrogate ghosts, which shows how cruel he is. However, Huiniang steps forward at this time, makes a big fuss in Jia's mansion, and punishes Jia Sidao and his henchmen who are rampant in the world. The old artist Tian Dennian played Jia Sidao very well. He did not portray this demon from the surface. His several laughs are all different and can well express Jia Sidao's inner world. Finally, Jia Sidao was frightened to death by Huiniang, and when he woke up, his "ah" sound meant that Li Huiniang, who represented 40,000 insulted and harmed weak women, stood up and finally defeated Jia Sidao, who represented the feudal ruling class! Huiniang, this vengeful ghost, is so magnificent and so brave!
    "White Jade Bracelet" is one of the ten major plays by Li Shishan, a Qing Dynasty playwright from Shaanxi. It reveals the struggle of the people of the Yuan Dynasty against the brutal rule and class oppression of the Yuan Mongols. The author inherited the tradition of Ming Dynasty legends and used a combination of realism and romanticism to describe this theme. "White Jade Bracelet" has a strong dramatic element. Li Yingzhen's performance of Shang Feiqiong follows the path of a young unmarried woman. Last year, when I brought the troupe to Xi'an to perform, the comrades of our troupe taught her "The Peony Pavilion" in the "Wandering in the Garden, Awakening from a Dream" scene. I also personally arranged the body movements of "Awakening from a Dream" for her and another young actor, Duan Julin. This time, seeing the "Dream Engagement" scene, I felt that she had used the body movements of "Awakening from a Dream" in this scene. The performance of the ethereal, wandering, and confused artistic conception, as well as the shy and affectionate, half-pushing and half-yielding expression when meeting Li Qingyan, are similar to the scenes of Du Liniang and Liu Mengmei. It can be seen here that the playwright was influenced by "The Peony Pavilion" when creating the play, and the actors also absorbed the performance techniques of "Wandering in the Garden, Awakening from a Dream," guiding the audience into a poetic and picturesque world and creating a climax in the first half of the play.
    The "Encounter at the Inn" scene is very popular. Li Qingyan was captured by the evil monks, lackeys of Emperor Yuan Shun. On the way to his escort, he stayed in an inn with Shang Feiqiong, who was rescued after attempting suicide by drowning. Separated by a wall, Shang Feiqiong poked a hole in the paper window with her finger and saw the dreamer with a rope tied around his neck, and was extremely grief-stricken, but in the end failed to exchange words. This is the most heart-wrenching part of the plot. Cai Zhicheng, who plays Li Qingyan, and Li Yingzhen, who plays Shang Feiqiong, both prominently embody the inner changes of the characters in this situation. The singing, acting, and expressions all give the audience a profound artistic feeling. However, I would like to make a suggestion about this scene. I remember that before leaving Xi'an last year, I saw Wanwan腔's "White Jade Bracelet." The content of the script for the "Encounter at the Inn" scene is basically the same as that of Qin腔, but the treatment method is different. In Wanwan腔's version of this scene, the escorts who arrested Li Qingyan were sleeping in the same inn room. When Shang Feiqiong heard Li Qingyan's voice next door, she poked a hole in the paper window with her finger and saw Li Qingyan through the small hole, and Li Qingyan also saw her. Just as they were about to ask each other, they dared not speak because they were being monitored. In this way, a tense atmosphere is created from the complicated environment, which increases the actor's expressive power, and it is reasonable and impeccable. This time, in Qin腔's "Encounter at the Inn" scene, Li Qingyan lived alone in a room, and the escorts only appeared at the final escort, which I think reduced the tension of the plot. First of all, this pair of young men and women who dream of each other suddenly meet in adversity. During the long period of singing and recitation, they never exchange a word, which shows that they are overly cautious and lack courage, which seems empty and weak. On the contrary, if there are escorts monitoring Li Qingyan next door, then the fear, caution, and unwillingness to speak of these two people will have a basis. At the same time, the audience will also worry about them both. In this way, the plot will be tighter and more convincing, and can push the play to the pinnacle of its climax.
    "Flame Colt" is the story of Yan Gui selling water, and it is also a traditional and good Qin腔 opera. Back then, we had seen Hebei Bangzi's "Selling Water," "Clearing the Road," and "Sacrificing the Stake," which were also very attractive. This Hebei Bangzi opera was derived from Qin腔, and the plot is roughly the same. This time, seeing the Qin腔 "Flame Colt," the "Clearing the Road" scene in the play is very moving, bringing the audience into an extremely shocking and heart-wrenching situation, sharing the joys and sorrows of this mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and hating the snobbish and insidious Huang Zhang and those powerful traitors. Meng Eyun is a 正工 (authentic) young female role in Qin腔. I saw her "Wujia Slope" in Xi'an. This time, she played Li's mother in "Flame Colt," and she brilliantly created the image of this mother who loves her son so much. She did not simply portray this old lady from an official family in the style of a poor old woman, but appropriately expressed Li's mother's identity. It can be seen that she has fused the acting skills of both young female roles and old female roles, which is a successful creation. Xiao Ruolan's performance of Huang Guiying shows her surprise after being suddenly slapped by Li's mother, and then her aggrieved and tolerant inner pain in layers. Seeing this, the audience can't help but feel sad for the misunderstanding between this mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Ning Xiuyun's performance of Zhou Ruiju, although she does not have many scenes, aptly played a role in setting off this tragedy. "Flame Colt" is a group play, and many characters have distinct personalities. The "Clearing the Road" scene can illustrate how exquisite and moving the whole play is.
    The performances of the Shaanxi Opera Troupe in the capital not only gave people unforgettable impressions of the traditional repertoires, but also achieved gratifying success with modern plays. Such as "Spring Thunder on Eagle Mountain," "Grain Riot," and "Liang Qiuyan;" and the Wanwan腔 - Hua Opera, which was moved from shadow puppetry to the stage, all had very moving singing. I will not list them one by one. What is moving about the performances of the Shaanxi Opera Troupe in the capital is that old artists such as Liu Yuzhong, Meng Eyun, and Tian Dennian performed on the same stage with young actors. Sometimes the old artists did not have many roles, or even played minor characters, which fully demonstrates their painstaking efforts to encourage and support the new generation, and the performances of the young actors did not disappoint the cultivation and promotion of the Party and the predecessors!

    谈秦腔几个传统剧目的表演
    梅茵芳
    我们很高兴，看到了陕西省戏曲赴京演出团一、二、三团在首都的演出。这不仅是他们的戏好，还因为这些剧种很早就和革命运动相结合，成为革命斗争的有力武器，使人们对它产生了深厚的感情，现在，我想来谈一谈我看过的几出秦腔的印象。
      “三滴血”是一出反主观主义的好戏。它通过一个悲欢离合的故事，说明了违反科学、迷信书本的错误。樊新民所创造的晋信书，把一个封建社会里食古不化、死啃书本的老学究主观武断的顽固思想充分地表达出来了。马少波同志在一次座谈会上说这个戏是秦腔里的
  “十五贯”，这话说得很好，但我觉得过于执和晋信书虽然都是典型的主观主义者，在造型方面却各有巧妙不同。过于执是俊扮，晋信书是丑扮；朱国梁扮演的过于执创造了符合苏昆独特风格的人物形象，樊新民则发挥了秦腔传统袍带丑的特点，排除了低级趣味的庸俗表演。这个戏里刘毓中演的周人瑞这个老人失子后悲恸欲绝的心情，从那几个招式中就深深地打动了观众，他是衰派行当出色的老演员。萧若兰、陈妙华、雷震中等都演得好，我们很熟悉他们的表演艺术。青年演员全巧民的贾连香是初见，她塑造的这个鲜明活泼少女的形象，给我留下了很深的印象。
    “游西湖”是很有人民性的，李慧娘不仅是个被侮辱被损害的女子，而且她是个反抗复仇的鬼魂。马蓝鱼扮演李慧娘，在“鬼怨”一场中，她把慧娘的悲愤心情和善良性格，在那如泣如诉的歌唱和矫捷轻盈的舞蹈中，刻划得很细致。“救生”时，马蓝鱼和扮演裴生的李继祖把传统的甩发、吹火、扑跌技巧，用来表现他们处于千钧一发时的紧张心情，十分成功。由于马蓝鱼纯熟的掌握了吹火技术，所以它和剧情严密地结合一处，不是卖弄技术。慧娘的满腔愤怒、她对贾似道英勇的反抗，在那口喷烈火朝廖寅扑去的表演中体现出来，这和罗四奎演的廖寅的表演是分不开的。当然，若是吹火技巧更进一步结合着慧娘掩护裴生逃走，刻划她用火去逼退廖寅的追杀，那么吹火更能显出气氛的紧张，有助于慧娘的性格描写。紧接着的“鬼辩”一场，把慧娘的形象提到了英勇高洁的峰巅。贾似道不仅是压迫人民的统治者，而且他敢于审鬼，由此可见他是多么凶残，但是慧娘这时挺身而入，大闹了贾府，惩罚了横行人间的贾似道以及他的爪牙。老艺人田德年把贾似道演得十分出色，他没有从表面刻划这个恶魔，他几次发笑都各不相同，很能表现贾似道的内心世界。最后，贾似道被慧娘吓得昏死过去，苏醒过来时“哎”的一声，正意味着代表四万个被侮辱被损害的弱女子的李慧娘，她站了起来，最后终于战胜了代表封建统治阶级的贾似道！慧娘这个复仇的女鬼，真是壮丽极了，也勇敢极了！
    “白玉瑱”是清代陕西剧作家李石山十大本戏之一，它揭示了元代人民反抗元蒙残暴统治和阶级压迫的斗争生活，作者继承了明代传奇的传统，以现实主义与浪漫主义相结合的手法来描写这个题材。“白玉瑱”的戏剧性很强。李应真演的尚飞琼是闺门旦的路子，去年我带了剧团到西安演出，我们剧团的同志曾教她“牡丹亭”里的“游园惊梦”；我还亲自为她与另一青年演员段菊林排过“惊梦”的身段。这次看到“梦订”一场感到她已把“惊梦”的身段运用在这一场里，在表现飘忽悠荡、迷离惝恍的意境以及与李清彦会面时的娇羞脉脉、半推半就的神情都与杜丽娘、柳梦梅的情景相似，这里可以看出剧作者在创作时曾受了“牡丹亭”的影响，而演员也吸取了“游园惊梦”的表演手法，把观众引导到诗情画意中，造成前半部戏的高潮。
    “店遇”一场是脍炙人口的，李清彦被元顺帝的爪牙恶僧捉住，在起解的途中与投水遇救的尚飞琼
  同住旅店，一墙相隔，尚飞琼用手指戳破了纸窗，看到法绳系颈的梦中郎，悲恸欲绝，但终于未能交言，这是剧情最能震荡人心的地方，扮演李清彦的蔡志成和扮演尚飞琼的李应真都突出地体现了剧中人在这种情景中的内心变化，唱、做及表情都给观众以深邃的艺术感受。但我对这场戏想提一个意见。我记得去年在离开西安之前，曾看过琬琬腔的“白玉瑱”，“店遇”一场剧本内容基本上与秦腔相同，但处理的方法却不同，琬琬腔的这一场戏，捉拿李清彦的解差是睡在这间店房里的，当尚飞琼在隔壁听到李清彦的声音，用手指戳穿纸窗，从小孔中看到李清彦，而李清彦也看到她，正想互相询问，由于有人监视而不敢说话。这样，就从复杂的环境中造成紧张的气氛，加重了演员的表现力量，而且是入情入理、无懈可击。这次秦腔的“店遇”一场，李清彦独住一室，解差要到最后起解时才上场，我认为却减少了剧情的紧张性。首先这一对眠思梦想的少年男女，在患难中忽然相遇，在大段唱念的时间里，始终未交一言，这对于入世不深的一对少年情侣的性格来说，表现出他们的顾虑重重，勇气不够，就显得空虚无力，相反地如果李清彦旁边有解差监视，那末这两个人的恐惧、顾虑和不敢交言就有了根据，同时观众还要替他们两人担心。这样，剧情就显得紧凑而更有说服力，并能把戏推向高潮的顶尖。
    “火焰驹”是彦贵卖水的故事，也是秦腔的传统好戏。当年，我们曾看过河北梆子的“卖水”“打路”“祭桩”，也是很吸引人的。河北梆子这个戏是从秦腔里演过来的，情节大致相同。这次看到秦腔“火焰驹”，戏中“打路”一场，非常动人，把观众带进极度震荡人心的境地，和这对婆媳同悲共戚，而去憎恶那势利阴险的黄璋以及那些权奸。孟遏云是秦腔中的正工青衣，我在西安看过她的“武家坡”，这次她在“火焰驹”中演李母，出色地创造了这位爱子心切的母亲形象。她不是用贫婆子那种路子去简单地刻划这个官宦人家的老太太，而是恰切地表达出李母的身份，可以看出她把青衣和老旦的演技熔合在一起了，这是一个成功的创造。萧若兰演的黄桂英，有层次的表现出她在被李母突然打了一掌后的惊讶，和后来那种委屈而又忍耐的内心痛苦，观众看到这里，对这一对婆媳的误会，不由得也要心酸泪下。宁秀云演的周瑞菊，戏虽不多，却恰如其分地在这场悲剧中起了烘托的作用。“火焰驹”是一出群戏，许多人物都有鲜明的性格，“打路”一场就可以说明整出戏是如何精湛动人了。
    陕西戏曲赴京演出团在首都的演出，不仅传统剧目给人难忘的印象，而且现代戏也取得了可喜的成功。如“鹰山春雷”“闹粮”“梁秋燕”；又如从皮影搬上舞台的琬琬腔——华剧，演唱都很动人，我就不一一列举了。陕西戏曲赴京演出团在首都的演出，令人感动的是像刘毓中、孟遏云、田德年等老艺人，和青年演员同台演出，有时老艺人戏不多，甚至演次要人物，这都充分说明了他们奖掖后进、扶植新生一代的苦心，而青年演员的表演，确实没有辜负党和前辈们的培育提携！
