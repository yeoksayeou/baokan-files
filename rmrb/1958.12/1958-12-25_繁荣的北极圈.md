Prosperous Arctic Circle
By our reporter Li Nan

I boarded a plane from the Arctic Air Force in Moscow, entered the Arctic Circle that evening, and arrived at Igarka on the bank of the Yenisei River the next day. Overnight, the scenery on the ground completely changed. Yesterday, there was not a trace of snow on the ground, but the next day it was dressed in full Arctic winter attire. I waded through the snow-covered wilderness, a meter deep, and entered this new city of the Soviet era. Looking around, wide streets, beautiful buildings, and bright lights reflecting the snow-covered red flags rushed into view. The scale of the city was no different from cities in other parts of the Soviet Union, except that the dim twilight scenery and the fluttering snowflakes added a unique flavor.

Walking into the place to stay, I suddenly felt as warm as spring. The host prepared a rich dinner for us: local meat, milk, fresh fish, potatoes, vegetables, everything. The host proposed a huge tour plan for us, including factories, farms, agricultural fields, wharves, universities, cultural institutions, and scientific institutions. Suddenly, a strange thought arose in our minds: Are we really in the Arctic Circle?

A place where nature unleashed its unrestrained power, a wilderness of ten thousand miles with no one around, a region where northern peoples faced death, a prison without iron bars where political prisoners suffered torment—this was the Arctic Circle of the past. But the Arctic Circle we see today is one where nature has been tamed, modern industries and cities have been built, agriculture, forestry, fishing, animal husbandry, and hunting have all developed, and culture and science are advanced, with people living warm and happy lives.

In the era of the Soviet regime, the Soviet people fought hard for decades, reversing the misfortune of the Arctic Circle and changing its face.

Timber Industry Center

Within the Arctic Circle, if you ask about the unique local economic sector, people will definitely answer that in addition to fishing and hunting, there is also the timber industry. Igarka is the timber production center in the Arctic Circle. Everything here is inextricably linked to timber. Beautiful tall buildings are built of timber, and the streets are paved with timber. In summer, rafts of timber float down the Yenisei River, supplying the needs of the entire long winter production.

We visited one of the leading timber joint factories in the Soviet Union. The factory has 3,000 workers and produces more than 300,000 cubic meters of timber annually. The factory's production process, from stacking timber to transporting finished timber, is mechanized. Some of the workers here are residents of the Arctic Circle, and some are young people from all over the country. They are all accustomed to and love life in the Arctic Circle.

Timber is everywhere. In the large area near the wharf, timber is piled up like buildings, forming neat and beautiful streets. Locomotives dedicated to transporting timber come and go. This timber will not be transported away from the river until next year.

Timber connects this joint factory, Igarka, and the Arctic Circle with other parts of the Soviet Union and the world. This year, thirty-six ocean-going ships of more than 10,000 tons from all over the world came to Igarka to carry precious timber. When we visited the timber joint factory, we heard the news of the Soviet Union's promulgation of the seven-year perspective plan. In the seven-year perspective plan, the timber center in this Arctic Circle is to increase its output by more than double.

Komsomol City in the Arctic Circle

Igarka is the Komsomol city in the Arctic Circle. The Soviet people's construction of the Arctic Circle began here. The growth of this city is reminiscent of the unforgettable years of the first five-year plan. In 1929, the first group of two hundred and fifty-two people first landed on this riverbank, rampant with wild animals and overgrown with thorns, and spent the first winter in the Arctic Circle. By the end of the year, they had built a small timber factory. The following year, they began to build the first batch of houses and open the first street. A few of these first log cabins are still preserved.

Walking on the streets of Igarka, one feels the tradition of the first builders everywhere, feeling that this is a city of builders. Ask anyone you meet, and they are either mechanical workers or construction workers. Ask them about their wishes! The answer is always to love the North and be willing to build the North for life. In the wind and snow, trucks transport building materials, and snowplows make rumbling noises. Young men and women with red faces and full of energy, unafraid of the thirty degrees below zero Arctic cold, are working. Finally, the hard ice and thick snow recede, and the howling wind also stops, revealing the construction site. This is truly the most beautiful picture in the Arctic Circle.

When we came to visit, Igarka had completed another major victory in construction: the first large stone building was built on the permanently frozen ground that could not bear pressure. We went to the underground tunnel of the permafrost experimental station here to see the permafrost situation of a layer of soil and a layer of ice. The deputy station chief told us that it is not easy to build a wooden building on permafrost. After seeing this experimental station, we understood why the people of Igarka regarded the first stone building as a major event.

More Doctors Here Than in the United States

The backwardness of culture, education, and health care in the Arctic Circle in the past has completely changed. In terms of medical and health care, Igarka has surpassed many regions in the Soviet Union, with more doctors. Local comrades told us that there are twenty-nine doctors per 10,000 people in Igarka cities and villages, while there are only thirteen doctors per 10,000 people in the United States. People still remember that among the first arrivals, there were three doctors. Now there are more than fifty doctors and more than one hundred secondary medical personnel. Infectious diseases that used to be rampant on the tundra have long been completely eradicated.

Igarka has as many as eight hospitals, with modern equipment and various equipment for treating malignant tumors. As for nurseries, kindergartens, and maternity stations, they not only fully meet the needs, but also have a surplus.

This not-so-large city has thirteen clubs, four libraries, thirteen schools, and two museums. In one museum, there are documents and souvenirs of Stalin and Sverdlov exiled in this area in those years. Looking at these souvenirs, the suffering years that the revolutionaries spent in the Arctic Circle in those years are like in front of us, forming a sharp contrast with the happy life in front of us.

Growing Grain in "Bear Dens," Fishing in Ice Caves

Today, the characteristics of economic life in the Arctic Circle are the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, fishing, animal husbandry, and hunting, not to mention industry. What moved us the most was that in such harsh conditions, the people of the Arctic Circle, after years of hard work, have developed agriculture.

We visited an agricultural experimental station that was established in 1930. The experimental station is located in a place formerly called "Bear Den." As the name suggests, it is an area where wild animals roam. Station chief Bashen told us that the temperature here is above zero for only two months, the sun's rays on the ground are not enough, and the ground below is permafrost where plants cannot grow. However, the experimental station finally found the most suitable varieties and figured out a set of cultivation methods. Comrade Bashen said that the solar heat is not enough, so we spread black ash on the ground to absorb more heat. We are fighting for one or two days, and as a result, we eat potatoes and fresh cabbage a month earlier than the southern regions.

To our surprise, the harvest in the Arctic Circle is even higher than in many places. The average potato yield here is twelve metric tons per hectare, cabbage is twenty metric tons, and barley is thirty quintals.

In the past, there was no animal husbandry in the Arctic Circle. Now, state-owned farms and collective farms have established specialized breeding farms. Igarka started raising more than two hundred dairy cows in 1935, and now it has increased to more than two thousand. The average milk yield has increased from 1,870 liters to more than 3,000 liters, and the highest is more than 4,000 liters.

We went to the Yenisei River to see the ice fishing situation in the severe winter. Where the sleds passed, we saw pairs of ice caves. Fishermen put the fishing net down from one ice cave and pull up the caught fish from another ice cave. In the forty degrees below zero severe cold, the fish froze after trembling a few times when it came out of the water, but the fishermen, after working for half a day, did not feel the severe cold at all.

Hunting is one of the most important sectors in the Arctic Circle. The residents of the Arctic Circle are skilled hunters. In summer, groups of wild deer come to the tundra, and in winter, snow-white Arctic foxes are active on the wild snow. They are all objects for hunters to show their skills. We visited the wooden houses where hunters spend the winter hunting and the animal farms that specialize in raising precious wild animals. Arctic residents call fur "soft gold." This gold can be said to be all over the Arctic Circle.

The Red Army Shines on the Tundra

Members of the Kirov Farm on the tundra across the Yenisei River specially drove sleds pulled by deer to pick us up to visit the farm. The sled pulled by deer runs fast and stable, and is a very common means of transportation in the Arctic Circle. The local residents in the Arctic Circle used to only engage in fishing and hunting, living a nomadic life on the tundra. After the collective farms were organized, they ended their poor nomadic life, developed diversified economies, and lived a settled life.

On the Yenisei River, we saw a red star shining on the river bank from afar. After entering the farm, this red star on the roof of the farm management office became even brighter. Perhaps because of the long Arctic night, we found that the residents of the Arctic Circle love to place a red star on the roof and crane. The red star looks even more brilliant and beautiful in the Arctic night sky.

Members of the Kirov Farm have completed a winter's workdays in the Arctic night. Every household is brightly lit, and the radio broadcasts Moscow's broadcasts. Everywhere, snow is piled up thickly, snow caps tower on the chimneys, beautiful garlands of snow hang on the power lines, and the low warehouses are almost buried in the snow.

Entering the houses of each member, we immediately felt infinite warmth. The hosts warmly entertained us. We ate fresh fish from the Yenisei River and drank newly brewed wine.

We visited the farm's livestock farm and animal farm. The excellent equipment here, the orderly order, along with the smiling faces of the members wearing white coats, expressing the joy of life and hospitality, left us with a deep impression.

This is life on the tundra, this is life in the Arctic Circle. The night has been conquered, and the severe cold has been overcome. The Arctic is now a warm and happy area, a symbol of the Soviet people's labor heroism. (Attached picture)

    繁荣的北极圈
    本报记者  李楠
    从莫斯科搭上北极航空队的飞机，当天晚上进入北极圈，第二天到达叶尼塞河岸的伊加尔卡。一夜之间，地面的景物完全改变了。昨天大地上还看不到一点雪迹，第二天却穿上了全身北极冬装，涉过积雪一公尺深的原野，进入这个苏维埃政权时代的新城市。放眼一看，宽阔的街道，美丽的楼房，一片明亮的灯光，映着白雪的红旗奔入眼帘。街市的规模和苏联其他地方的城市没有分别，只是昏淡的黄昏景色，纷飞飘落的雪花更别具一番风光罢了。
    走进住的地方，突然感觉温暖如春。主人给我们准备了丰盛的晚餐：当地出产的肉类、牛奶、鲜鱼、马铃薯、蔬菜，应有尽有。主人为我们提出了庞大的参观计划，有工厂、农庄、农场、码头、高等学校、文化机构、科学机关。突然之间，我们心中泛起了一个奇怪的想法：难道我们真的置身在北极圈之内吗？
    大自然逞肆淫威的场所，万里无人的原野，北方民族走向死亡的区域，政治犯苦受折磨的不需要铁栏的牢狱，这曾经是昔日的北极圈。但今天我们所看到的北极圈，却是大自然被驯服了，现代化的工业和城市建设起来了，农、林、渔、牧、猎全发展起来了，文化科学发达，人民生活温暖幸福。
    在苏维埃政权时代，苏联人民苦战几十年，扭转了北极圈的恶运，改变了北极圈的面貌。木材工业中心
    在北极圈内，如果问起当地特有经济部门，人们一定回答除了渔业、猎兽而外，还要加上木材工业。伊加尔卡是北极圈内的木材生产中心。这儿一切都和木材有不可分割的联系。美丽高大的楼房是木材建成的，街道是木材铺砌的。夏天，在叶尼塞河上流来一排排的木筏，供应整个漫长冬季生产的需要。
    我们参观了在苏联数一数二的木材联合工厂，工厂有三千工人，每年生产木材三十多万立方。工厂生产过程从堆砌木料到运送制成的木材都是机械化了的。这里的工人有的是北极圈内的居民，有的是各地来的青年，他们都习惯和热爱北极圈内的生活。
    到处都是木材。在临近码头的大片地区，木材堆得像一幢幢的房屋似的，组成了一条条整齐美观的街巷。专门运送木材的机车来来去去。这些木材也要一直等到明年才从河道中运走。
    木材使这个联合工厂，使伊加尔卡，使北极圈这一带地区同苏联各地，同世界各地联系起来。今年有三十六艘世界各国万吨以上的远洋船来到伊加尔卡，载运珍贵的木材。当我们访问木材联合工厂的时候，正听到苏联颁布七年远景计划的消息。在七年远景计划中，这个北极圈内的木材中心要增加一倍多的产量。
    北极圈内的共青团城
    伊加尔卡是北极圈内的共青团城。苏联人民建设北极圈从这里开始。这个城市的成长令人想起那难以忘怀的第一个五年计划的年代。1929年第一批二百五十二个人首先登上了这块野兽横行、荆棘丛生的河岸，度过了北极圈内的第一个冬天。在年底他们就建成了一个小小的木材工厂。第二年开始建立第一批房屋，开辟第一条街道。这第一批小木屋现在还保存了几座。
    走在伊加尔卡街头，处处感觉到当年第一批建设者的传统，感觉到这是建设者的城市。随便问问遇到的人吧，不是机械工人就是建筑工人。问问他们的愿望吧！回答总是热爱北方，愿意终身建设北方。在风雪交加中，汽车运来建筑材料，推雪机发出隆隆声响。满脸红光，一身干劲，不畏零下三十度北国风寒的男女青年们在劳动。终于坚冰和厚雪退却了，狂风也停止怒吼了，露出了建设场地。这真是北极圈内一幅最美丽的图画。
    在我们来访问的时候，伊加尔卡又完成了一件建设上的一大胜利：在不能承受压力的永久冻土带上，建成了第一个大型石头建筑物。我们曾到这里的冻土实验站地下隧道去看了看一层土壤一层冰条的冻土情况。副站长告诉我们，在冻土上建一座木头楼房也不容易。看了这个实验站，才了解为什么伊加尔卡的人们把第一座石头建筑当成一件大事。
    这儿的医生比美国还多
    北极圈内过去那种文化教育卫生落后的情况完全改变了。在医药卫生方面，伊加尔卡后来居上，医生数目比苏联许多地区都多。当地同志告诉我们，伊加尔卡城市和乡村一万人中有二十九名医生，而美国一万人中只有十三名医生。人们还记得在第一批到来者当中，有三名医生，现在已有医生五十多人，中等医务人员一百多人了。过去猖獗在苔原上的传染病早已完全绝迹。
    伊加尔卡的医院竟有八所之多，设备现代化，还有医治恶性肿瘤的各项设备。至于托儿所、幼儿园、接生站不仅完全满足需要，而且还有富余。
    这个不太大的城市有十三所俱乐部、四座图书馆、十三所学校、两座博物馆。在一所博物馆里，有当年斯大林、斯维尔德洛夫流放在这一带地区的文件和纪念物。我们看着这些纪念物，当年革命者在北极圈所度过的苦难岁月如在目前，和眼前的幸福生活成了鲜明的对照。
    “熊窝”上种粮冰窟里捕鱼
    今天北极圈经济生活的特点是农、林、渔、牧、猎全面发展，工业更不必说。最使我们感动的是在这样严酷的条件下，北极圈的人们积多年的苦战成果，发展了农业。
    我们参观了一个从1930年成立的农业实验站。实验站所在地过去名叫“熊窝”。顾名思义，是野兽纵横的地区。站长巴申告诉我们，这里温度在零上的时间只有两个多月，地面上太阳的照射不够，地面下是植物不能生长的冻土。但是实验站终于找到了最合适的品种，摸索出了一套耕作方法。巴申同志说，太阳热力不够，我们就在地面撒下黑灰，吸收更多的热力。我们是为争取一天两天而奋斗，结果我们比南方地区要早一个月吃到马铃薯和新鲜白菜。
    使我们惊奇的是北极圈内的收成竟比许多地方都高。这儿的马铃薯平均收成是每公顷十二公吨，白菜是二十公吨，大麦三十公担。
    过去北极圈内没有饲畜业，现在国营农场和集体农庄都建立了专门的饲养场。伊加尔卡从1935年开始饲养二百多头奶牛，现在已增加到二千多头。平均挤奶量从一千八百七十公升增加到三千多公升，最高的达四千多公升。
    我们在叶尼塞河上去参观了严冬冰下捕鱼情况。在雪橇经过的地方，看到一对对的冰窟。捕鱼人从一个冰窟放下鱼网，从另外一个冰窟把捕得的鱼拉起来。在零下四十度的严寒下，鱼一出水面颤动了几下就僵硬了，但捕鱼人劳动半天，却丝毫不感觉严寒可畏。
    猎兽是北极圈内一个最主要的部门。北极圈内的居民是打猎的能手。夏天一群群野鹿来到苔原上，冬天毛色纯白的北极狐在野雪上活动，都是猎人们施展身手的对象。我们参观了猎人过冬打猎的木屋，参观了专门饲养珍贵野兽的养兽场。北极居民称呼皮毛是“柔软的金子”。这种黄金可以说遍布北极圈各个地区。
      红军照耀着苔原
    叶尼塞河对岸苔原上的基洛夫农庄庄员们特别赶着鹿拉的雪橇来接我们去农庄参观。鹿拉的雪橇跑得快，跑得稳，是北极圈的很普遍的交通工具。北极圈内的当地居民过去只从事捕鱼和打猎，过着在苔原上到处流浪的生活。组织了集体农庄以后，他们才结束了贫困的流浪生活，发展了多种经济，过着定居生活。
    在叶尼塞河上，远远就看见河岸上闪耀着一颗红星。进入农庄以后，这颗在农庄管理处屋顶上的红星更加明亮。也许因为有漫长的北极夜的缘故，我们发现北极圈的居民爱在屋顶上、起重机上安置一颗红星。红星在北极夜空更显得灿烂美丽。
    基洛夫农庄庄员已经完结了一个冬天北极夜里的劳动日。家家户户灯火通明，无线电播送着莫斯科的广播。到处雪积得厚厚的，烟囱上高耸着雪帽，电线上挂着雪的美妙的花环，低矮的仓库几乎埋在雪堆中去了。
    进入每家庄员的房屋，立刻感到无限的温暖。主人们热诚地招待我们。我们吃了叶尼塞河里的鲜鱼，喝了新酿的美酒。
    我们参观了农庄的饲畜场和养兽场，这里优良的设备，井然的秩序，连同穿着白罩衫的庄员们的表示着生活快乐和殷勤好客的满脸笑容，给我们留下了深深的印象。
    这就是苔原上的生活，这就是北极圈内的生活。夜晚被征服了，严寒被战胜了。北极现在成了温暖幸福的区域，成了苏联人民劳动英雄主义的象征。（附图片）
