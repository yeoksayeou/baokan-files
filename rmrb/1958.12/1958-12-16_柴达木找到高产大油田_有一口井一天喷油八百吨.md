Xinhua News Agency, Mang'ai, 14th: This year, petroleum exploration in the Qaidam Basin has achieved unprecedentedly fruitful results: two high-yield oilfields and three high-yield gas fields have been found. Building upon work from previous years, eight oilfields have been confirmed to have industrial value. Explorers say, "By casting nets everywhere, we have caught big fish this year. The work ahead is how to get the fish into our hands."

The most encouraging event this year was the discovery of a high-yield oilfield in the No. 5 structure of the Lenghu exploration area. Of the eight exploratory wells drilled in this structure this year, three wells gush over 200 tons of crude oil per day. One well's daily output even reached 800 tons. The crude oil gathered into a lake beside the derrick. One evening, a flock of wild ducks mistook it for a real lake and landed in the oil. The exploratory wells here gush large and stable amounts of oil, with gasoline accounting for half of the crude oil. These exploratory wells can be utilized as production wells. The Lenghu area has relatively convenient transportation and good mining conditions. The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau has deployed its first major campaign of "catching big fish" here, transferring nine excellent drilling teams from various exploration areas and concentrating over ten drilling rigs to drill in this structure, striving to clarify the oil-bearing area and reserves in the shortest possible time. The other major oilfield discovered this year is the Shizigou structure in the Youshashan exploration area. All eight wells drilled here have oil flowing or oil and gas shows. One well gushes over 100 tons of crude oil per day, proving that it is rich in oil.

The three gas fields discovered this year include two in the Mahai exploration area and one in the Youquanzi exploration area. The largest gas field gushes over one million cubic meters of natural gas per day, a rare high-pressure gas field in the world. Now, people in the Mahai area use natural gas for cooking, heating, brick-making, driving cars, and even steelmaking.

In several oilfields already confirmed to have development value, some production wells were test-produced this year, yielding nearly 30,000 tons of crude oil. Gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil were refined on-site to supply transportation teams and well teams.

Large-scale petroleum prospecting and exploration of the Qaidam Basin began in 1954. Over the past five years, more than 120 potentially oil-bearing structures have been found, and 291 exploratory wells have been drilled on 41 structures. Among them, 229 exploratory wells have gushed oil or had oil and gas shows. Exploration data proves that the Qaidam Basin has both structural and lithological oil reservoirs; fracture and sandstone oil reservoirs; shallow "bungalow" oil layers and deep "high-rise" oil layers. The four major exploration areas that have already been explored could all become oil areas. Oil seepages have also been discovered in many places in the eastern part of the basin, which has not been explored. This shows that the entire Qaidam Basin is very likely to become a veritable "oil sea."

### 柴达木找到高产大油田  有一口井一天喷油八百吨

    柴达木找到高产大油田
    有一口井一天喷油八百吨
    据新华社茫崖14日电  柴达木盆地的石油勘探今年获得了空前丰硕的成果：找到了两个高产量的大油田，三个高产量的大气田，并在前几年工作的基础上证实了八个油田具有工业价值。勘探人员都这样说：由于到处撒网，今年已经网住大鱼了。今后的工作是如何把鱼抓到手里。
    在冷湖探区五号构造找到高产大油田，是今年最鼓舞人心的事。这个构造上今年钻了八口探井，有三口井每日喷出原油都在两百吨以上。其中，有一口井日喷量曾达八百吨，原油在井架边汇集成湖，一天黄昏，一群投宿的野鸭竟误落到油湖里。这里的探井喷油多，喷量稳定，原油中含汽油达到一半。这些探井都可以利用作为生产井。冷湖地区交通比较方便，具备较好的开采条件，青海石油勘探局在这里部署了“捉大鱼”的第一个会战，从各探区调来了九个优秀的钻井队，集中了十多部钻机在这个构造上开钻，争取在最短期间把储油面积和储量弄清楚。今年发现的另一个大油田是油砂山探区的狮子沟构造。这里钻的八口井都有油流出或有油气显示。其中有一口井日喷原油一百多吨，证明这里含油十分丰富。
    今年发现的三个大气田，两个在马海探区，一个在油泉子探区。最大的气田日喷天然气在一百万立方公尺以上，是世界上罕见的高压气田。现在，马海地区的人们煮饭、取暖、烧砖、开汽车，甚至炼钢，都利用天然气。
    在已经肯定有开采价值的几个油田上，今年还试采了一些生产井，生产了原油近三万吨，就地炼取汽油、煤油、柴油，供运输队和井队使用。
    柴达木盆地是从1954年开始进行大规模的石油普查勘探的。五年来，共找到一百二十多个可能储油构造，在四十一个构造上打了二百九十一口探井，其中喷出油和有油气显示的探井有二百二十九口。勘探的资料证明，柴达木盆地有构造储油，也有岩性储油；有裂缝储油，也有砂层储油；有“平房”浅油层，也有“楼房”深油层。已经进行了勘探工作的四大探区，都可能成为油区；没有进行工作的盆地东部，也发现多处油苗。这说明整个柴达木盆地极有可能成为名副其实的“石油海”。
