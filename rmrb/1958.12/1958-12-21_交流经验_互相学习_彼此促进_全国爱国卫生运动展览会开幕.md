Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The National Patriotic Health Campaign Exhibition opened today simultaneously at the Working People's Cultural Palace and Zhongshan Park in Beijing.

More than 500 people attended the opening ceremony, including Minister of Public Health Li Dequan, Vice Ministers Xu Yunbei and Wu Yunfu, Vice President of the Red Cross Society of China Hu Lansheng, guests from various agencies, organizations, and troops stationed in Beijing, foreign friends, and staff members from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions participating in the exhibition.

Li Dequan spoke at the opening ceremony. She said that since last winter, a patriotic health campaign with a larger scale than ever before has been launched across the country. Significant achievements have been made in the past year. In order to do a better job and further advance the patriotic health campaign next year, a national exhibition of exchanging experiences and learning from each other in the patriotic health campaign has been held in Beijing on the basis of the patriotic health campaign exhibitions held in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. However, due to the rush of preparation time and the limited exhibition space, it is not possible to exhibit all the achievements of various places, especially the inventions and creations of the masses. Li Dequan hoped that the comrades who visited would offer criticisms and suggestions on how to further improve the patriotic health work in the future.

After Li Dequan's speech, the representative from Hunan Province sent a congratulatory message to the conference: Changde County in this province eliminated hookworm disease throughout the county with a single dose of the traditional Chinese medicine "Guanzhong Soup."

The opening ceremony concluded with Li Dequan cutting the ribbon.

The exhibition is divided into six pavilions, exhibiting more than 3,700 exhibits sent by 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. The exhibition mainly includes the achievements made by various places in eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and preventing and controlling diseases. Some are comprehensive introductions, and most are arranged by province, city, and autonomous region. There are physical objects, models, pictures, introductions to the experiences and deeds of advanced units and advanced individuals, each with its own characteristics, rich and colorful. From this exhibition, it can be seen that in 1958, due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership, the extensive and in-depth mobilization of the masses, and the close integration with production, the national patriotic health campaign had a great leap forward in the socialist construction front, and the health work also had a great leap forward. Through this exhibition, it can play a role in exchanging experiences and promoting each other, so that the patriotic health movement can continue to develop in depth and achieve greater victories.

The exhibition is scheduled to end at the end of February next year.

    交流经验  互相学习  彼此促进
    全国爱国卫生运动展览会开幕
    新华社20日讯  全国爱国卫生运动展览会今天在北京劳动人民文化宫和中山公园同时开幕。
    参加开幕仪式的有卫生部部长李德全、副部长徐运北、伍云甫，中国红十字会总会副会长胡兰生，以及北京各机关、团体、驻京部队的来宾，外国友人，各省、市、自治区参加展览会的工作人员等五百多人。
    李德全在开幕式上讲话。她说，从去冬以来，全国各地掀起了一个比以往规模更为宏大的爱国卫生运动。一年来，已经获得了显著的成绩。为了明年把爱国卫生运动做得更好，更向前推进一步，在各省、市、自治区所开的爱国卫生运动展览会的基础上，在北京举办了一个全国性的交流经验、互相学习的爱国卫生运动展览会。但是由于准备的时间匆促，以及展出地方有限，还不能把各地的成绩，尤其是群众的发明创造全部展出。李德全希望参观的同志们对今后如何进一步改进爱国卫生工作提出批评和意见。
    李德全讲话后，湖南省的代表向大会送来一份喜报：这个省的常德县用中药“贯众汤”一举消灭了全县的钩虫病。
    开幕仪式最后由李德全剪彩。
    这个展览会共分六个馆，展出了二十七个省、市、自治区送来的展品三千七百多件。展出内容主要包括各地在除四害、讲卫生、防治疾病等方面所取得的成绩，有一部分是综合的介绍，大部分是按省、市、自治区为单位陈列的，有实物，模型，图片，有先进单位、先进人物的经验和事迹介绍，各有特点，丰富多彩。从这个展览会上可以看到：在1958年这一年中，全国爱国卫生运动由于加强了党的领导，广泛深入地发动了群众，和生产密切结合，在社会主义建设战线上其它方面大跃进的同时，卫生工作也有了一个大的跃进。通过这个展览会，可以起相互交流经验、相互促进的作用，使爱国卫生运动继续深入开展，取得更大胜利。
    展览会预定在明年2月底结束。
