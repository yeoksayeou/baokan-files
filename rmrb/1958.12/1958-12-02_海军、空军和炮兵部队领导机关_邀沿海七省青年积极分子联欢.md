Xinhua News Agency, December 1st: The leadership organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, Air Force, and Artillery recently jointly invited youth activists from seven coastal provinces, including Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning, to a joint celebration to thank the coastal people for their enormous support to the Liberation Army.

Attending the gathering were Navy Deputy Commander Luo Shun Chu, Political Department Director Duan De Zhang, Air Force Political Department Director Wang Hui Qiu, Artillery Political Department Director Ren Liu He, Fujian Frontline Artillery Political Commissar She Ji De, and representatives of officers and soldiers from the three services. Hu Ke Shi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the heads of the delegations from the seven coastal provinces also participated in the gathering.

Over the past few years, the coastal people and the Liberation Army have guarded the coast side by side, forging a close combat friendship between the military and the people. At the celebration, Duan De Zhang, Wang Hui Qiu, and others, on behalf of the officers and soldiers of the three services, presented twelve silk banners and gifts to units and individuals who had contributed to supporting the front, such as the Xia Men City He Cuo Village Elementary School Youth Support-the-Front Brigade and the Da Deng Island Youth Women's Shock Team.

In his speech, Hu Ke Shi called on the youth to always learn from the Liberation Army's noble character of being loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people, and to be the Liberation Army's backing. Hong Xiao Zi, the militia company commander of the Fujian Front, expressed on behalf of the youth activists that they would continue to do a good job in supporting the front and fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu.
