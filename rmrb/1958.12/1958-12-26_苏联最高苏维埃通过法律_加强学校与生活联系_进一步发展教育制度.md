Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th (TASS): After two days of discussion, the Soviet Supreme Soviet’s Second Session passed a law on December 24th regarding strengthening ties between schools and life, and further developing the Soviet national education system.

This law consists of forty-two articles, which stipulate measures for reorganizing secondary school education, vocational and technical education, secondary specialized education, and higher education.

The preface to the law points out that the issue of strengthening ties between schools and life is of particularly important significance for the victorious completion of the task of building communism. It is considered extremely wrong to think that physical labor will disappear with the automation of production in a communist society. Physical labor will continue to exist. Without creative, enjoyable physical labor that strengthens the body and improves physical functions, the harmonious development of man is unimaginable.

The law states that the issue of communist education for the working people, especially the growing generation, will become the central issue in the work of state organs and social organizations.

The law states that children must be cultivated to participate in social public welfare labor in the future, starting from the time they begin their education. All young people from the age of fifteen or sixteen should participate in physical labor that is within their ability and is beneficial to society, and all their subsequent education must be combined with productive labor in the national economy.

The law stipulates that the Soviet Union will implement an eight-year universal compulsory education system to replace the current seven-year universal compulsory education system. The law states that the eight-year school, as the first stage of education, should equip students with a solid foundation of general education and comprehensive technical education, and cultivate their love of labor and willingness to participate in social welfare activities. The second stage—complete secondary education for young people—begins at the age of fifteen or sixteen, and this stage of education should be carried out according to the principle of combining education with productive labor.

The law points out that the Soviet Union will establish the following schools to implement complete secondary education: schools for working youth (part-time secondary general education schools in the form of night schools), where graduates of eight-year schools who work in various sectors of the national economy can receive secondary education, with a study period of three years; secondary general comprehensive labor technology schools that combine study with productive labor, with a study period of three years; technical schools and other secondary specialized schools.

The law stipulates the establishment of urban and rural vocational and technical schools, with majors divided according to various production sectors. Existing factory schools, vocational schools, railway schools, and other specialized schools will be reorganized into urban vocational and technical day schools and night schools, with a study period of one to three years. The study period in rural vocational and technical schools will be one to two years.

The law states that the tasks of communist construction require that institutions of higher learning be linked to life and production, and that the theoretical level of training specialists be raised in accordance with the latest scientific and technological achievements. One of the tasks of institutions of higher learning is to train highly skilled experts who have been educated on the basis of Marxist-Leninist theory, who have mastered the latest domestic and foreign scientific and technological achievements, who are proficient in their business, and who are not only able to fully utilize modern technology but also able to create future technology.

The law points out that it is best for most higher technical schools to combine teaching with production in the first and second years based on night school or correspondence school education systems. At the same time, the law believes that it is appropriate for university students majoring in complex theoretical courses that require a large amount of laboratory practical work to separate from production and study for the first two or three years.

The law pays great attention to the issue of training engineers for new technology sectors and further developing scientific and design work.

The law stipulates that the work of transitioning from seven-year to eight-year universal compulsory education and establishing various types of complete secondary schools should begin in the 1959-1960 academic year and be completed within three to five years. The reorganization of secondary, higher, and secondary specialized education should also begin in the same period and be completed within three to five years, according to national characteristics and local characteristics.

The law points out that the number of specialists trained each year to work in the Soviet national economy, science, and culture sectors should be continuously increased according to growing needs.

The law states that the Soviet Supreme Soviet believes that schools approaching life will create the necessary conditions for better educating the growing generation who will live and work in a communist society in the future.

    苏联最高苏维埃通过法律
    加强学校与生活联系
    进一步发展教育制度
    新华社25日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议经过两天的讨论，24日通过了关于加强学校与生活联系和进一步发展苏联国民教育制度的法律。
    这项法律共有四十二条，其中规定了改组中等学校教育、职业技术教育、中等专业教育和高等学校教育的措施。
    这项法律的序言指出，加强学校同生活联系的问题对胜利完成共产主义建设的任务具有特别重要的意义。认为到共产主义社会体力劳动将随生产的自动化而消失的想法是极端错误的。体力劳动仍然要继续存在。没有创造性的、使人愉快的、增强体质和提高身体生活机能的体力劳动，人的和谐发展是不可想像的。
    法律说，对劳动人民、特别是对正在成长的一代进行共产主义教育的问题将成为国家机构和社会团体的工作中的中心问题。
    法律说，必须在儿童开始受教育时，就开始培养他们在将来参加社会公益劳动。全体青年从十五、六岁起应当参加体力所能办到的对社会有益的劳动，而且对他们往后的全部教育必须同国民经济中的生产劳动相结合。
    法律规定苏联实行八年制普及义务教育，以代替目前的七年制普及义务教育。法律说，作为第一阶段教育的八年制学校应当使学生具备普通教育和综合技术教育的巩固的基础知识，培养他们热爱劳动、愿意参加社会公益活动。第二阶段——青年的完全中等教育从十五、六岁开始，这一阶段的教育要根据教育同生产劳动相结合的原则进行。
    法律指出，苏联将建立下列实施完全中等教育的学校：工农青年学校——夜校形式的、多部制的中等普及教育学校，八年制学校毕业的而且在国民经济各部门工作的人员可以在这种学校受中等教育，学习期限为三年；同生产学习相结合的中等普通综合劳动技术学校，学习期限为三年；技术专科学校和其他中等专业学校。
    法律规定建立城市和乡村职业技术学校，这些学校的专业按各生产部门划分。现有的工厂学校、职业学校、铁路学校和其他专业学校将改组为城市职业技术日校和夜校，学习期限为一年到三年，在乡村的职业技术学校的学习期限则为一年到二年。
    法律中说，共产主义建设的任务要求高等学校联系生活和生产，要求根据最新科学技术成就提高培养专家的理论水平。高等学校的任务之一是培养受过以马克思列宁主义学说为基础的教育、掌握本国和外国最新科学技术成就、通晓业务、不仅能够完全利用现代技术而且能够创造未来的技术的高度熟练的专家。
    法律中指出，大部分高等技术学校在一、二年级最好是根据夜校或函授学校教育制度把教学与生产结合起来。法律同时认为，对于那些一开始就要学习复杂的理论课程而且要进行大量的实验室实践工作的专业的大学生，在头二、三年脱离生产而进行学习是适宜的。
    法律对为新技术部门和进一步发展科学和设计工作而培养工程师的问题十分重视。
    法律规定，从七年制过渡到八年制普及义务教育以及建立各种类型的完全中等学校的工作要在1959—1960学年开始，而且要在三、五年内完成。中等、高等和中等专业教育的改组工作也要在同时期开始并且根据民族特点和地方特点在三、五年内完成。
    法律中指出，每年培养出来的到苏联国民经济、科学和文化部门工作的专家的人数应该根据日益增长的需要而不断增加。
    法律中说，苏联最高苏维埃认为，学校接近生活将为更好地教育将来在共产主义社会中生活和劳动的成长中的一代创造必要的条件。
