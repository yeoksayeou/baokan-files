Grasping Production with One Hand, Grasping Education with the Other
——How the Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 17 Party Committee Leads Workers' Spare-Time Education
Chen Fu, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 17 Party Committee

    The Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 17 established a spare-time school as early as 1950. However, the questions of whether the factory Party committee should manage the spare-time school and how to manage it were not resolved. At that time, everyone believed that the factory was only responsible for production and not for education. Therefore, the political atmosphere in the school was weak, some teachers were unwilling to accept the leadership of the Party, and the teachers did not respect each other. In terms of teaching, they copied the curriculum of ordinary schools, which was seriously divorced from the factory's production reality and the current political struggle. Some teachers, when teaching history, promoted personal heroism and the achievements of feudal emperors; some teachers showed an extremely irresponsible attitude towards students. During the Rectification Movement, the Party committee examined and criticized the shortcomings of abandoning the leadership of spare-time education in the past, and strengthened its leadership over spare-time schools. The ideological awareness of the teachers has also been greatly improved.
    The factory Party committee's leadership in spare-time education first unified the school-running ideology, established the idea of the whole Party and the whole factory running the school, grasping production with one hand and grasping education with the other, so that all factory workers recognized that running schools in factories is the path to running communist factories.
    In the initial stage of preparing for the Red-Expert University (formerly known as the Textile Specialized School), many Party and government cadres were afraid that education would affect production. They said: "The great leap forward in production and the vigorous technical revolution are already very intense, how can we cope with another cultural revolution? Let's do it when the production tasks are a little looser!" "We can't even manage production, where do we find the time and energy to run a school?" Many engineers and technicians doubted and ridiculed such universities, saying: "It takes us more than ten years to graduate from university, and we read a lot of technical theory books. Now the schools you run have short study times, read fewer theory books, and specialize in linking with key production issues. Can the quality of such universities be guaranteed?" Some people suggested that they must complete the courses of ordinary universities to be considered university graduates. Many teachers said: "Teachers in universities should be professors, can people like us be considered professors?" "In the past, it took eighteen years from illiteracy to university graduation, now it has been changed to four years, how can it be done? This kind of school system cannot be found in 'encyclopedias'!" Some also said: "Since we are running a university, it must look like a university, the curriculum, the school system, and the equipment should be the same as ordinary universities." In short, they believed that the factory did not have the conditions to run a university, and even if it did, it would not be considered a university.
    Faced with these ideas, the Party committee first conducted a serious discussion at the Party committee meeting, and then organized the masses to study relevant documents and launched a contention and blooming debate. Some comrades said: We are in the era of the Great Leap Forward, the leap forward is endless, and the enthusiasm is also endless. The production tasks are getting heavier and heavier, and we must never sit and wait for the production to ease before engaging in the cultural revolution. The great leap forward in production has promoted the technical revolution, and it has also driven the cultural revolution, and the cultural revolution has promoted the technical revolution. Understanding the relationship between these two aspects, and arranging them properly, will not only not affect production, but will also promote further development of production. During the debate, university students working in the factory used their own experience to illustrate that many courses in the university were divorced from production reality. Many people believe that the machines in the factory are the most practical instruments and equipment, and the various key technical problems that arise every day in production, after experimental solutions, are the best experimental lessons. Worker comrades, especially old workers, have rich experience in struggle and production knowledge. If they can obtain the necessary cultural and scientific knowledge, they can approach or reach university level. Some people said: "The 'Anti-Japanese Military and Political University' run by the liberated areas during the Anti-Japanese War had no equipment and taught in the open air, and cultivated tens of thousands of outstanding cadres. Is the quality of this school low?" Some comrades said: "The factory has dozens of engineers with both scientific theoretical knowledge and practical experience, and thousands of old workers with fifteen to twenty years of service. We adopt the teaching methods of 'using local methods instead of foreign methods', 'combining local and foreign methods', and 'the able being the teacher'. They are the best teachers." After many mass debates, a basic consensus was reached on the understanding of running the school, and a wave of enthusiasm for running the school was set off throughout the factory.
    After the Red-Expert University was established, the Party committee quickly realized that the school's teaching was not closely integrated with production labor. However, it was difficult to rely solely on a few full-time teachers to solve the many key production problems that occurred in the workshop every day through education. Therefore, the Party committee decided to adopt an integrated leadership organizational form of factory and school unity, and completely combine the factory's political and ideological education, technical activities, and the school's curriculum. Leaders at all levels are not only responsible for production, but also responsible for the departments of the Red-Expert University. For example, political lessons are taught by Party committee members as professors, general branch members as lecturers, and branch secretaries as teaching assistants; technical lessons are taught by the deputy director of production and the directors and engineers of each workshop, who combine the key problems that occur in production with basic theoretical knowledge; cultural and sports activities, business management and other professional education are also included in the teaching plan of the Red-Expert University. This makes it both a factory, a school, and a scientific research institute.
    When the factory-school unity was first implemented, some people shouted again: "Grasping education will affect grasping production." In response to these confused understandings, the Party committee organized the masses to study the central government's instructions on education work, and also organized a debate among all factory workers through political lessons. Many facts have proved that grasping education with one hand and grasping production with the other not only did not affect production, but also promoted a greater leap forward in production. A symposium held by the general branch working group of the First Workshop proved that good students of the Red-Expert University are necessarily workers who are good in production, good in politics, and good in social activities. Zhang Lanying, a weft inserter in the cloth machine room, only got rid of illiteracy in June of this year, and is now a first-year student at the Red-Expert University. Once, the teacher talked about "breaking superstitions and liberating thinking," citing many deeds of inventions and creations by humble people, which greatly inspired her. She went back and used clay to make models and worked hard to study, and with the support of the branch secretary and the help of the master, she invented an automatic weft-picking machine that a technician had spent thousands of yuan trying to experiment with without success. Preliminary experiments showed that one automatic weft-picking machine is equivalent to twenty-three laborers, increasing work efficiency dozens of times. Zhu Xiaolong, a worker in the sizing room, also got rid of illiteracy in June of this year. For the sake of the technical revolution, he also bought a technical book on sizing drying cylinders. Based on the theoretical knowledge in the book combined with his own experience, he and his group comrades jointly studied and changed the pressing roller lining flannel to using wool and fine cloth, overcoming the shortcomings of uneven weaving density caused by uneven thickness of the sizing liquid.
    The leading cadres of workshops and work groups who pay attention to grasping production with one hand and grasping education with the other have relatively good production; if they only grasp production and not education, their work will often be passive and chaotic.
    Through study and debate, the factory's cadres further clarified the idea of factory-school unity, grasping production with one hand and grasping education with the other. Therefore, even under the circumstances of tense production, cadres at all levels also guarantee the workers' spare time for study. Facts have proved that grasping education has not affected production. The factory's cotton yarn production in the third quarter increased by 26.83% compared with the second quarter, and in November it also won the high-yield red flag award from the Shanghai Textile Management Bureau.
    The Party committee also specifically focused on improving the teaching quality of the Red-Expert University, and guided the school teachers, engineering technical cadres, and old workers to research and compile some teaching materials that are targeted at the factory's actual production situation and scientific research, according to the principle of "using local methods instead of foreign methods" and "combining local and foreign methods." Many new teaching methods have been implemented. Under the guidance of the Party committee, teachers actively participate in physical labor in the workshops and often visit the masses. They improve the quality of teaching and transform their thinking through these activities.

    一手抓生产  一手抓教育
    ——上海国棉十七厂党委是怎样领导职工业余教育的
    上海国棉十七厂党委宣传部部长  陈夫
    上海国棉十七厂从1950年就创办了业余学校。但是，工厂党委要不要管业余学校和怎样来管业余学校等问题，没有得到解决。当时，大家认为工厂只管生产，不管教育。因此，学校里政治空气薄弱，有些教师不愿接受党的领导，教师之间互不服气。在教学方面，照搬普通学校的课程，严重地脱离工厂的生产实际和当前的政治斗争。有的教师在讲历史时，宣扬个人英雄主义和封建帝王的丰功伟绩；有的教师对学生表现了极不负责任的态度。整风运动中，党委检查和批判了过去放弃对业余教育领导的缺点，并加强了对业余学校的领导。教师们的思想觉悟也有了很大的提高。
    工厂党委领导业余教育，首先统一办学思想，树立全党全厂办学，一手抓生产、一手抓教育的思想，使全厂职工认识到工厂办学是办共产主义工厂的道路。
    在筹办红专大学初期（原名纺织专科学校），许多党政干部害怕教育影响生产，他们说：“生产大跃进，大闹技术革命已很紧张，再来个文化革命怎么吃得消？等生产任务稍松些再搞吧！”“生产都管不过来了，哪来时间和精力办学？”许多工程技术人员怀疑和讥笑这样的大学，他们说：“我们读到大学要十几年，读了一大堆技术理论书籍，现在你们办的学校学习时间短，理论书读得又少，专门讲联系生产关键，这样的大学质量有保证吗？”有人提出，必须读完普通大学的课程才算大学毕业。不少教师说：“在大学里教书的应该是教授，我们这般人也能算教授？”“过去从文盲到大学毕业要十八年，现在改为四年怎么能行？这种学制在‘百科全书’里也找不到！”也有人说：“既然办大学就得像个大学样子，课程、学制、设备应该同普通大学一样。”总之，他们认为工厂没有办大学的条件，即使办起了大学也不算大学。
    党委面对着这些思想，首先在党委会上进行认真的讨论，然后组织群众学习有关文件，开展鸣放争辩。有的同志说：我们是处在大跃进的时代，跃进是无止境的，干劲也是无穷无尽的，生产任务越来越重，绝不能坐待生产轻松时再搞文化革命。生产大跃进促进了技术革命，也带动了文化革命，而文化革命又促进了技术革命。理解了这两方面的关系，妥为安排，不但不影响生产，而且会推动生产进一步发展。辩论中，在厂里工作的大学生以亲身经验说明大学里许多课程脱离生产实际。许多人认为，工厂里的机器就是最实际的仪器设备，生产中每天产生着的各种技术关键问题，经过试验解决就是最好的实验课。工人同志尤其是老工人有着丰富的斗争经验和生产知识，如果他们能获得必要的文化科学知识，就能接近或达到大学水平。有人说：“抗日战争时期解放区办的‘抗日军政大学’，没有设备，露天上课，培养出了成千上万的优秀干部，难道这种学校质量低吗？”有的同志说：“全厂有几十个既有科学理论知识，又有实际经验的工程师，有上千个十五年到二十多年工龄的老工人，我们采用‘以土代洋’、‘土洋结合’、‘能者为师’的教学方法，他们是最好的教师。”经过多次群众性的大辩论，办学认识基本上取得统一，于是，办学的热潮就在全厂掀起了。
    红专大学创办起来以后，党委很快发觉学校的教学与生产劳动结合得不够紧密。但是，要单独依靠几个专职教师通过教育解决车间每天所发生的许多生产关键问题，是很困难的。于是，党委决定采取厂校合一的一元化领导的组织形式，把工厂中的政治思想教育、技术活动与学校的课程完全结合起来。各级领导不但是生产的负责人，同时又是红专大学的、系的负责人。比如，政治课由党委委员担任教授，总支委员当讲师，支部书记当助教；技术课由生产副厂长和各工场场长、工程师等负责，他们把生产中发生的关键问题与基本理论知识结合起来进行教学；文娱体育活动、企业管理等专业教育也都纳入红专大学的教学计划。这就做到既是工厂，又是学校，同时也是科学研究院。
    在开始实行厂校合一的时候，有人又叫喊：“抓教育会影响抓生产”。党委针对这些糊涂认识，组织群众学习中央关于教育工作的指示，又通过政治课组织全厂职工大辩论，许多事实证明，一手抓教育，一手抓生产，不仅没有影响生产，而且推动生产更大的跃进。一工场总支组织工作组召开的座谈会证明，凡是红专大学的好学生，必然也是生产好、政治好、社会活动好的工人。布机间插纱工张兰英，今年6月才摘掉文盲帽子，现在是红专大学一年级学生。有一次，老师讲“破除迷信，解放思想”，举了许多卑贱者发明创造的事迹，给她很大的启发。她回去用泥土做模型刻苦钻研，在支部书记的支持和老师傅的帮助下，发明了一部技术员曾花了几千元没有试验成功的自动拣纡脚机，经初步试验，一部自动拣纡脚机等于二十三个劳动力，提高工作效率几十倍。浆纱间工人朱小龙，也在今年6月才摆脱文盲状态。为了技术革命，他还买了一本浆纱烘筒式的技术书，他根据书里的理论知识结合自己的经验，与小组同志共同研究，把压浆棍衬绒平布改用毛布和细布，克服因浆液厚薄不匀造成织布密度不均匀的缺点。
    工场和车间的领导干部凡是注意一手抓生产，一手抓教育，生产就比较好；如果只抓生产，不抓教育，工作往往就会被动忙乱。
    通过学习和辩论，全厂干部对厂校合一，一手抓生产，一手抓教育的思想进一步明确起来。因此，在生产紧张的情况下，各级干部也都保证工人的业余学习时间。事实证明，抓教育并没有影响生产，全厂第三季度完成生产计划棉纱产量比第二季度提高26.83％，11月份还得到了上海纺管局的高产红旗奖。
    党委还具体的抓红专大学提高教学质量工作，并且根据“以土代洋”和“土洋结合”的方针，指导学校老师、工程技术干部和老工人，研究编写了一些针对本厂生产实际情况和科学研究的教材。实行了许多新教学法。教师们在党委的指导下积极参加车间的体力劳动，经常访问群众，通过这些活动来提高教学质量，改造思想。
