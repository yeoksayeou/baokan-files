Kunming Dispatch: The Qinlao People's Commune in Fumin County, Yunnan Province, has reversed the tendency to neglect diversified operations and is actively expanding commodity production to increase income.

The Qinlao People's Commune, with more than 23,000 members, had a period starting in July this year when some commune cadres argued that there was no surplus labor for diversified operations. At the same time, they believed that commodity production was difficult to manage and would generate capitalist spontaneous forces. Therefore, while vigorously developing steel and grain production, the commune transferred personnel who were originally engaged in sideline production to other production, causing half of the twelve sideline production and local industrial projects originally operated by the commune to be shut down. The production volume of the other projects that continued production was only half of what it had been before. After the autumn harvest, the commune management committee held a meeting attended by cadres above the team level and some commune member representatives to specifically calculate the distribution accounts. The result of the calculation was that although the grain yield was more than 1,100 jin per mu this year, and each person could receive more than 1,600 jin of grain, the cash income was not high because diversified operations had not been developed. After paying wages, the cash in the commune's possession was only enough to pay for half a month. After clarifying their financial situation, the cadres and the masses demanded to develop diversified operations to increase income. On the basis of unified understanding, labor was rationally arranged. In addition to ensuring the field management of the minor spring crops, steel production, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction, 15% of the labor force could be invested in sideline production. Since late October, the commune has established a diversified operations command, and according to the various production projects operated by the commune and the specialties of the commune members, it has organized more than 100 professional groups, adopting quota management methods of setting quantity, setting quality, and setting time, and rewarding overproduction. In more than a month, the commune has carried out 21 production projects such as digging medicinal materials, fishing, and shearing wool.

    云南勤劳公社重整旗鼓搞副业
    本报昆明电  云南省富民县勤劳人民公社扭转了忽视多种经营的倾向，积极扩大商品生产，以增加收入。
    拥有二万三千多个社员的勤劳人民公社，从今年7月份以来，在社干部中曾经一度出现没有多余的劳动力进行多种经营的论调，同时认为商品生产难管理，会产生资本主义自发势力。因此在大搞钢铁、粮食生产的时候，公社抽调原来从事副业生产的人员去搞别的生产，使全社原来经营的十二项副业生产和地方工业停掉了一半，其它继续生产的项目，生产量也只有以前的一半。秋收结束以后，公社管理委员会曾召开有队以上干部和一部分社员代表参加的会议，具体算了一下分配账。算账的结果，今年虽然粮食亩产一千一百多斤，每人可收入粮食一千六百多斤，但是由于多种经营没有搞起，现金收入不多，发工资以后，公社掌握的现金只够发半个月的。摆清家底后，干部群众纷纷要求发展多种经营，增加收入。在大家认识统一的基础上，合理安排了劳动力，全社除了保证小春田间管理、钢铁生产、积肥和修水利而外，有15％的劳动力可投入副业生产。10月下旬以来，公社成立了多种经营指挥部，根据全社经营的各种生产项目和社员的专长，组织了一百多个专业组，采取定数量、定质量、定时间的定额管理办法和超产奖励的办法进行生产。在一个多月的时间内，全社已开展挖药材、捕鱼、剪羊毛等二十一种生产项目。
