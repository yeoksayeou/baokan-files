Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 2nd. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued a statement here on the evening of December 1st, saying that the results of the fraudulent elections held by France in Algeria on November 30th do not bind the Algerian people.

The statement pointed out that the election was carried out by the French occupying forces and only expressed the opinions of the French army. The Algerian people will continue to expose the hypocrisy and deceptive nature of the elections.

The statement said that the elections prove that the de Gaulle government continues to disregard the will of the Algerian people and obstruct the realization of peace in Algeria. The statement said that the elections cannot stop the struggle of the Algerian people, and only through negotiations between the Algerian government and the French government as equal parties in a neutral country can the struggle be stopped. The statement finally called on the United Nations to urge France to end its imperialist war in Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd. Algiers Dispatch: The farce of the French National Assembly elections staged in Algeria from November 28th to 30th has not yet announced official results as of the 2nd; however, according to preliminary reports, the list of candidates put forward by the fascist riot organization "Committee of Public Safety," which advocates the annexation of Algeria, "won" in at least fifteen of the eighteen electoral districts in Algeria with the support of French army bayonets.

Although the elected candidates in the remaining electoral districts are not from the "Committee of Public Safety," they also campaigned under the banner of "French Algeria." There was not a single candidate who advocated for Algerian independence.

Like the "referendum" held on September 28th, this election was also conducted under the threat of military terror. Dividing the election into three days was to allow the French army to concentrate on polling places in turn, forcing Algerians to vote and control the conduct of the election.

According to "l'Humanité," the date on which each electoral district voted was treated as a military secret, and voters were only notified at the last minute. "l'Humanité" also wrote that in places where voting was held on the 28th, the French army command began prohibiting residents from passing through from midnight on the 27th.

On the day of the vote, the French army dispatched armored vehicles to search for Algerian voters in residential areas and villages, and then forcibly escorted them to vote. An Associated Press reporter who went to the polling station reported that the French army instructed Algerians on who to vote for. The reporter said that a voter told him: "The polling station stamps a special seal on each voter's voter card. No one knows what will happen to those who refuse to vote."

Despite being coerced by the bayonets of the French army, newspapers reported that 40% of Algerian voters still refused to vote. In areas where the French army's control was not strict, the number of abstentions reached 80%.

Candidates engaged in infighting and fierce quarrels due to competition for parliamentary seats. Candidates who failed in the election mutually condemned their competitors for various conspiracies and fraudulent activities. Dessevre, who ran in Mostaganem and lost, telegraphed de Gaulle after his defeat, stating that he "condemns the fraudulent act of obtaining votes through administrative pressure and violence." He also said: "Voters do not have electoral freedom."

    阿尔及利亚政府声明
    阿人民不受法国伪选约束
    法国用刺刀强迫投票受到阿尔及利亚人民抵制
    新华社开罗2日电  阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府1日晚间在这里发表声明说，法国11月30日在阿尔及利亚举行的虚伪选举的结果约束不了阿尔及利亚人民。
    声明指出，选举是法国占领军所搞的，而且仅仅表达了法国军队的意见。阿尔及利亚人民将继续揭露选举的虚伪和欺骗性质。
    声明说，选举证明戴高乐政府继续无视阿尔及利亚人民的意愿，阻挠在阿尔及利亚实现和平。声明说，选举阻止不了阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，只有通过阿尔及利亚政府和法国政府作为平等的双方在一个中立国举行谈判，才会使斗争停止下来。声明最后要求联合国促使法国结束它在阿尔及利亚的帝国主义战争。
    新华社3日讯  阿尔及尔消息：从11月28日到30日，在阿尔及利亚上演的法国国民议会选举的丑剧，到2日为止还没有宣布正式结果；但是据初步消息，主张并吞阿尔及利亚的法西斯暴乱组织“救国委员会”所提出的候选人名单，在法国军队刺刀的支持下，在阿尔及利亚的十八个选区中至少有十五个选区“当选”。
    在其余的选区当选的虽然不是“救国委员会”的候选人，但是也是打着“法国的阿尔及利亚”的旗帜竞选的。候选人中根本就没有一个主张阿尔及利亚独立的人。
    像9月28日举行的“公民投票”一样，这次选举也是在军事恐怖的威胁下进行的，把选举分成三天举行就是为了让法国军队可以轮流集中到投票地点去，强迫阿尔及利亚人投票并且控制选举的进行。
    据“人道报”报道，哪一个选区在哪一天投票被当作军事机密，只是在最后的时刻才通知选民。“人道报”还写道，在28日举行投票的地方，法国军队司令部从27日半夜就开始禁止居民通行。
    投票那天，法国军队出动了装甲汽车在居民点和乡村寻找阿尔及利亚选民，然后强押他们去投票。曾经到投票站现场去过的美联社记者报道说，法国军队指示阿尔及利亚人投谁的票。这个记者说，一个选民对他说：“选举站在每个选民的选民证上盖上特别的印鉴。谁也不知道，那些拒绝投票的人会有什么样的遭遇。”
    尽管在法国军队的刺刀的胁迫下，据报纸指出，仍旧有40％的阿尔及利亚选民拒绝投票。在法军控制不严的地区，弃权的人数达到80％。
    候选人之间由于争夺议会席位而勾心斗角并且发生了激烈的争吵。在选举中遭到失败的候选人互相谴责他们的竞争者进行的各种阴谋和舞弊行为。在摩斯塔加内姆竞选的德塞夫尔在落选后，打电报给戴高乐，表示他“谴责用行政压力和暴力取得选票的欺骗行为。”他还说：“选民没有选举自由。”
