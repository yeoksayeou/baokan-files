Fiberboard is a type of artificial board made from various wood fibers and other plant fibers through steaming and pressing. Fiberboard has a hard texture, uniform structure, and is resistant to wear, expansion, contraction, warping, and cracking. It also eliminates the inevitable defects of natural wood, such as knots, discoloration, rot, embedded bark, and wormholes. Therefore, it is called "lumber without defects." It becomes even more vibrant and pleasing when painted or colored. Through oil immersion and special processing, it can be made waterproof, fireproof, and resistant to corrosion and acids. At the same time, because the mechanical properties of fiberboard can be controlled during the manufacturing process, and the length and width can be adjusted as needed, it is suitable for various different uses. According to relevant statistics, fiberboard has more than 300 uses. Hard fiberboard can replace general lumber for construction, furniture manufacturing, and the decoration of vehicles and ships. Soft fiberboard is mostly used for insulation, heat insulation, and sound absorption. Fiberboard is also an excellent insulating material and can be widely used in the motor manufacturing industry. Other industries and rural people's communes can also use fiberboard in large quantities. Therefore, the fiberboard industry has extremely broad development prospects.

Rapidly developing fiberboard production has great economic significance and is a major way to fully utilize forest resources, comprehensively utilize wood, and improve wood utilization rates. Currently, after the harvested logs are processed, about 30% or more of the branches, tops, bark, shavings, and sawdust are not reasonably utilized and are mostly burned. The raw materials for fiberboard are precisely these waste scraps. 3.3 cubic meters of waste scraps can produce one cubic meter of fiberboard. Generally, hard fiberboard with a thickness of 3 mm can replace natural veneer with a thickness of 12 cm. One cubic meter of 3 mm thick hard fiberboard has an area of 280 square meters and can replace 5.7 cubic meters of lumber made from logs. A large number of shrubs and one- or two-year-old branches are also good raw materials for fiberboard. If production starts next year according to the national plan, China's wood utilization rate will gradually increase from the current 60% to over 90%. In addition, herbaceous plants can also be used as raw materials, such as rice straw, wheat stalks, corn stalks, bagasse, hemp stalks, and reeds, which can all be ground into fibers to manufacture fiberboard.

Fiberboard production is not only easy to obtain materials, which are everywhere, but also, because the manufacturing of fiberboard produces plasticity under high temperature and high pressure, the already separated fibers are tightly interwoven and bonded together. Therefore, it can be made without any glue, the processing is simple, and the investment is small. Establishing a fiberboard factory with an annual output of 600 tons requires an investment of about 60,000 yuan and can be built in 30 days. The machines for producing fiberboard can be completely manufactured domestically, and workers can master the operating techniques after short-term training.

The fiberboard industry is still an emerging industry in our country. In the past year or two, many units have conducted trial production and research, and have achieved great results. Some creative methods have been adopted in the trial production process. In terms of scale, large factories are transformed into small ones, changing large factories with an annual output of 18,000 cubic meters into small factories with an annual output of 600 cubic meters. The construction progress can be accelerated five times, and the investment of one large factory can build more than 90 small factories, and the output will be three times that of the large factory. In terms of equipment, foreign equipment is localized, and both domestic and foreign methods are combined. Instead of using steam, gas generators or oil heating are used, eliminating the need for boilers. The steel plates used in hot presses are replaced with cast iron. Stone rollers are used instead of fiber separators. Chipping machines and other equipment have also adopted local substitutes. All these have created extremely favorable conditions for the widespread use of local methods in the fiberboard industry, and it is enough to show that both cities and villages are fully capable of running such factories.

    没有缺点的木材
    纤维板是利用各种木材纤维及其他植物纤维经过蒸煮、加压制成的一种人造板。纤维板质地坚硬、构造均匀、耐磨、不膨胀、不收缩、不翘曲开裂，而且消灭了天然木材中不可避免的节疤、变色、腐朽、夹皮、虫眼等缺点，所以被称为“没有缺点的木材”。如喷漆着色，更为鲜艳悦目。通过油浸和特殊加工，能防水、防火和耐腐、耐酸。同时由于纤维板的力学性质可以在制造过程上加以控制，长宽度也可根据需要进行伸缩，所以适用于各种不同的用途。据有关资料统计，纤维板的用途有三百多种。硬质纤维板能代替一般板材用于建筑、制造家具和车船装修等方面。软质纤维板多用于保温、隔热、吸音等方面。纤维板还是很好的绝缘材料，可广泛用在电机制造工业方面。其他工业和农村人民公社也都可大量使用纤维板。因此，纤维板工业有着极为广阔的发展前途。
    迅速发展纤维板工业生产，具有很大的经济意义，是充分利用森林资源、综合利用木材、提高木材利用率的一个主要途径。现在，采伐下来的原木经过加工约有30％以上的枝桠、梢头、板皮、刨花、锯末等剩余物未能合理利用，大多都烧掉了。而纤维板的原料，正是这些废材碎料。三点三立方公尺的废材碎料，可制一立方公尺纤维板。一般三公厘厚的硬质纤维板顶十二公分厚的天然薄板使用，一立方公尺三公厘厚的硬质纤维板的面积为二百八十平方公尺，可代替五点七立方公尺原木制成的板材使用。大量的灌木和一两年生的枝条也都是纤维板的好原料。如果明年即开始按国家计划进行生产，我国的木材利用率将由现在的60％左右，逐步提高到90％以上。另外在原料上还可利用草本植物。如稻草、麦秆、玉米秆、蔗渣、麻秆、芦苇等，都能磨成纤维制造纤维板。
    纤维板生产不仅取料容易，遍地都是，同时由于纤维板的制造是在高温、高压下产生的可塑性，把已经分离的纤维重新紧密交织粘结在一起，所以不需要任何胶料即可制成，加工过程简便，投资也少。建立一个年产六百吨的纤维板厂，约需投资六万元，三十天就可建成。生产纤维板的机器国内完全可以制造，工人经过短期培训即可掌握操作技术。
    纤维板工业在我国还是一个新兴的工业，近一两年来，有不少单位进行了试制研究，取得了很大成绩。在试制过程中采取了一些创造性的办法。在规模上，化大为小，把年产一万八千立方公尺的大厂改为年产六百立方公尺的小厂，建厂进度可以加快五倍，一个大厂的投资可以建九十多个小厂，产量则为大厂的三倍。在设备上，化洋为土，土洋结合。不用蒸气，改用瓦斯发生炉或油加热，省去了锅炉。热压机用的钢板改为铸铁。纤维分离机改用石碾子代替。削片机和其他设备也都采用了土的代替。所有这些都为纤维板工业土法遍地开花创造了极为有利的条件，也足以说明不论城市和乡村兴办这种工厂都是完全有条件的。
