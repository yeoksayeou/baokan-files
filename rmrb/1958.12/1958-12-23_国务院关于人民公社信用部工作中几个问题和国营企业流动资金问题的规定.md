After the rural people's communes were established, according to the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Improving the Rural Financial and Trade Management System to Adapt to the Situation of People's Communes," the state's credit institutions in rural areas must be decentralized to the people's communes. How the people's communes will carry out credit work in the future, and what the relationship between the people's commune credit institutions and the higher-level banks will be, need to be specifically stipulated. At the same time, in order to make credit management work and working capital management work adapt to the new situation and the needs of economic development, and to unify the system and simplify procedures, the state's original deposit interest rates, loan interest rates, and management methods for the working capital of state-owned enterprises also need to be changed. To this end, the State Council stipulates:

　　(1) All units within the people's commune shall calculate interest on deposits and loans to the credit department (only handling monetary deposits, not physical deposits). This is because not only is the credit department an accounting unit, but other economic units and institutions within the people's commune must also conduct separate accounting. Calculating interest on both deposits and loans is conducive to encouraging these units to save on the use of funds, reduce costs, and better implement economic accounting.

　　(2) All capital transactions between the people's commune credit department and the higher-level bank shall be handled according to the relationship between deposits and loans, and the deposit and loan interest shall be calculated at a monthly rate of 4.2‰. The profits and losses of the people's commune credit department are still uniformly accounted for by the commune.

　　(3) The higher-level People's Bank manages the credit funds of the people's commune credit department by adopting the method of offsetting deposits and loans and contracting the difference. The people's commune credit department prepares a credit plan on an annual or semi-annual basis, and submits it to the higher-level People's Bank for review. If the loan is greater than the deposit, a quota subsidized by the higher-level bank is determined; if the deposit is greater than the loan, a task of depositing to the higher-level bank is determined, and the people's commune credit department contracts according to the quota and task. After the people's commune credit department has contracted, if the deposit increases, the loan can be increased.

　　(4) The use of various loans shall be controlled by the people's commune itself. Within the total amount of loans, the people's commune can adjust and use the loans between industrial loans, commercial loans and agricultural loans by itself. However, these loans generally should not be transferred to capital construction and other aspects. If the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions deem it necessary, they may also stipulate certain restrictions on the scope of the adjustment.

　　(5) Unify various loan interest rates. The people's commune is an organization that promotes the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and integrates industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. The various loan interest rates of the people's commune need to be unified. Starting from January 1, 1959, the interest rates on industrial, agricultural, and commercial loans will be uniformly calculated at a monthly rate of 6‰, that is, the agricultural loans originally issued by the bank will be increased from a monthly rate of 4.8‰ to a monthly rate of 6‰, and the agricultural loans originally issued by the credit cooperative will be reduced from a monthly rate of 7.2‰ to a monthly rate of 6‰; the interest rates on industrial loans and commercial loans remain unchanged at a monthly rate of 6‰. Such regulations on loan interest rates have a smaller scope of change, and the interest rates on all loans in urban and rural areas across the country are completely uniform.

　　(6) Reduce savings deposit interest rates. Starting from January 1, 1959, the current savings will be reduced from a monthly rate of 2.4‰ to a monthly rate of 1.8‰, the fixed-term half-year savings will be reduced from a monthly rate of 5.1‰ to a monthly rate of 3‰, and the fixed-term one-year savings will be reduced from a monthly rate of 6.6‰ to a monthly rate of 4‰.

　　(7) Various past loans shall be repaid separately. The production and capital construction loans originally borrowed by agricultural cooperatives and rural handicraft cooperatives shall be uniformly repaid by the people's communes; the poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans originally issued during the period of agricultural cooperation shall also be uniformly repaid by the people's communes; loans to individual members shall, according to different circumstances, be repaid by individuals (such as general living loans and production loans), or by the people's communes on their behalf (such as livestock and farm implements purchased with loans that have been transferred to the people's communes). Specific measures shall be stipulated by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions according to the actual situation.

　　(8) The credit department of the people's commune is not only a component of the people's commune, but also a business office of the People's Bank in the local area. For the convenience of work, the credit department can display two signs at the same time.

　　(9) The credit departments of the people's communes shall handle foreign exchange remittances uniformly. Specific remittance procedures shall be stipulated by the head office of the People's Bank.

　　(10) The working capital of state-owned enterprises shall be uniformly managed by the People's Bank. The working capital originally allocated to state-owned enterprises by the state treasury shall be completely converted into loans from the People's Bank and uniformly calculated for interest. The working capital that the state has devolved to the various enterprise units of the people's communes shall also be handled in accordance with this principle. In the future, the increased fixed amount of working capital required by state-owned enterprises shall still be appropriately arranged by the finance departments at all levels from the annual budget and lent uniformly by the local People's Bank. The increased fixed amount of working capital required by enterprises under the people's communes shall also be appropriately allocated by the financial departments of the people's communes in the commune budget and lent uniformly by the credit department. The verification of the working capital of enterprises shall still be handled separately according to the original method: the part belonging to the fixed amount of working capital (that is, the part that is frequently needed) shall be the responsibility of the finance department, in coordination with the People's Bank and relevant departments, to verify; the part belonging to the non-fixed amount of working capital (that is, the part that is needed seasonally and temporarily) shall be loaned by the People's Bank according to the actual situation.

    国务院关于人民公社信用部工作中几个问题
    和国营企业流动资金问题的规定
    （一九五八年十二月二十日国务院全体会议第八十三次会议通过）
    农村人民公社化以后，根据“中共中央、国务院关于适应人民公社化的形势改进农村财政贸易管理体制的决定”，国家在农村的信用机构必须下放到人民公社。今后人民公社如何进行信贷工作，人民公社信用机构同上级银行之间的关系如何，需要具体加以规定。同时，为了使信贷管理工作和流动资金的管理工作适应新的情况和经济发展的需要，并且划一制度，简化手续，国家原定的存款利率、贷款利率和国营企业流动资金管理办法，也有必要加以改变。为此，国务院规定：
      （一）人民公社内部各单位向信用部存款和贷款（只办货币存款，不办实物存款），一律计算利息。因为不但信用部是一个核算单位，人民公社内部其他各经济单位、事业单位，也必须分别进行核算。存款和贷款都计算利息，有利于鼓励这些单位节约使用资金，降低成本，更好地实行经济核算。
    （二）人民公社信用部和上级银行间的资金往来，一律按存贷关系办理，存贷利息一律按月息四厘二计算。人民公社信用部的盈亏仍然由公社统一核算。
      （三）上级人民银行对人民公社信用部信贷资金的管理，采用存贷相抵、差额包干的办法。人民公社信用部按年度、或半年编制信贷计划，报送上级人民银行审查，贷款大于存款的，确定一个由上级银行补助的指标；存款大于贷款的，确定一个向上级银行存款的任务，由人民公社信用部按指标和任务包干。人民公社信用部在包干以后，存款增加了，可以增加贷款。
      （四）各种贷款的使用，由人民公社自行掌握。人民公社在贷款总数的范围内，可以在工业贷款、商业贷款和农业贷款之间，自己调剂使用。但是这些贷款一般不得调剂到基本建设及其他方面。省、市、自治区如果认为必要，也可以对调剂的范围，规定某些限制。
    （五）统一各项贷款利率。人民公社是农林牧副渔全面发展、工农商学兵互相结合的组织，人民公社的各种贷款利率需要统一起来。自1959年1月1日起，工业、农业、商业贷款利率统一按月息六厘计算，即是把原来银行发放的农业贷款，由月息四厘八提到月息六厘，原来信用社发放的农业贷款，由月息七厘二降为月息六厘；工业贷款和商业贷款的利率仍然按月息六厘不动。贷款利率这样规定，变动的面较小，而且全国城市乡村所有各项贷款的利率，也就完全划一了。
    （六）降低储蓄存款利率。自1959年1月1日起，活期储蓄由月息二厘四降到月息一厘八，定期半年的储蓄由月息五厘一降到月息三厘，定期一年的储蓄由月息六厘六降到月息四厘。
      （七）过去的各种贷款分别负责偿还。原来农业合作社和农村的手工业合作社所贷的生产和基本建设贷款，统一由人民公社负责偿还；原来在农业合作化时期发放的贫农合作基金贷款，也统一由人民公社偿还；社员个人的贷款，按照不同情况，有的仍然由个人偿还（如一般生活贷款和生产贷款），有的由人民公社代为偿还（如用贷款所买的牲畜、农具已转交给人民公社）。具体办法由各省、市、自治区根据实际情况，加以规定。
    （八）人民公社的信用部既是人民公社的组成部分，又是人民银行在当地的营业所。为了便于工作，信用部可以同时挂两个牌子。
    （九）人民公社信用部一律办理对外汇兑。具体汇兑手续由人民银行总行规定。
    （十）国营企业的流动资金，一律改由人民银行统一管理。过去国家财政拨给国营企业的自有流动资金，全部转作人民银行的贷款，统一计算利息。国家下放给人民公社的各企业单位的自有流动资金，也按照这个原则办理。今后国营企业需要增加的定额流动资金，仍然由各级财政从年度预算中适当加以安排，交当地人民银行统一贷放。人民公社所属企业需要增加的定额流动资金，也由人民公社财政部门在公社预算中适当拨出一部分资金，交信用部统一贷放。关于企业流动资金的核定，仍然分别按照原来的办法办理：属于定额流动资金的部分（即经常需要的部分），由财政部门负责，协同人民银行和有关部门，加以核定；属于非定额流动资金的部分（即季节性和临时性需要的部分），由人民银行根据实际情况贷放。
