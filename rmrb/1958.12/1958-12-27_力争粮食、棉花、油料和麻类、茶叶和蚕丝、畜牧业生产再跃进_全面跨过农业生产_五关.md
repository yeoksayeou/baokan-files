Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: The National Representative Meeting of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction continued today. Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China and Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report on agricultural issues at the meeting. Representatives from five provinces and cities, Shanxi, Shanghai, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu, spoke at the meeting.

In his report, Liao Luyan discussed three issues: (1) The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958; (2) Striving for a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959; (3) Unifying understanding, raising awareness, improving production, improving living standards, and running the rural people's communes even better.

In the first part of his report, Liao Luyan said that the increase in the proportion of various agricultural crops was unprecedented in 1958. The total national grain output reached about 750 billion jin, more than double that of 1957, an increase of about 380 billion jin in one year, which is more than double the total increase (180 billion jin) during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. The total cotton output reached about 67 million dan, also more than double that of 1957, an increase of 34 million dan in one year, which is much more than the total increase in the past five years. The increase in oil-bearing crops, other industrial raw material crops, and animal husbandry was also unprecedented or rarely seen. In analyzing the characteristics of this year's leaping agricultural situation, he pointed out that the increase in the yield per unit area of ​​crops this year is greater than in any previous year; from wheat to early rice to late rice to late autumn crops, the output is higher season by season; many crops and regions that were previously considered low-yielding have now become high-yielding, while high-yielding crops and high-yielding regions are even more productive.

Liao Luyan said that the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in 1958 powerfully refuted the pessimistic arguments of some people who believed that "agricultural production cannot develop rapidly" and the concerns about China's "large population and little arable land," and also shattered the bourgeoisie's "population theory" and the imperialist reactionaries' curse that we "cannot solve the population contradiction."

Liao Luyan also pointed out that while agricultural production experienced a great leap forward this year, forestry, fishery production, agricultural reclamation, water conservancy construction, and meteorological undertakings in our country also leaped forward together. The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production also promoted the development of various undertakings such as community-run industries, rural commerce, transportation, post and telecommunications, science, culture, education, and health.

When talking about the experience of this year's Great Leap Forward in agriculture, Liao Luyan pointed out three points: First, implement political command and strengthen the leadership of the Party; second, promote and develop the Party's traditional style of mass line; third, earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production (water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, tools, management). Liao Luyan said that these rich and successful experiences of 1958 must be applied to the work in 1959.

In the second part of his report, Liao Luyan first pointed out that although the achievements on the agricultural front in 1958 were unprecedentedly great, agricultural production had not completely passed the barriers. It is still necessary to continue to pass the "five barriers," which are: grain, cotton, oil-bearing and bast crops, tea and silk, and animal husbandry. In order to meet the ever-growing demands of people's lives, production in these areas must be greatly increased. He also put forward specific requirements for increasing the production of various crops in 1959.

Regarding how to strive for a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production next year, Liao Luyan talked about the following issues in his report: At present, it is necessary to focus on the field management of overwintering crops, winter production, water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and preparations for spring plowing; it is necessary to carry out a large-scale movement of high-yielding fields, and earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Constitution," and cultivate gardens; People's communes should achieve all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, so that agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are combined with and depend on each other. It is necessary to implement the production policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production. State-owned farms should play an exemplary role in these aspects.

Liao Luyan said that the 1959 grain and cotton production increase plan is still a leaping plan. This plan is entirely possible to complete, and it should be strived to exceed. We must do everything possible to strive for a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

In the third part of his report, Liao Luyan elaborated on the nature and tasks of the people's communes.

After Liao Luyan's report, representatives from five provinces (cities) spoke at today's meeting.

Li Shunda, the representative of Shanxi Province (Director of Jinxing People's Commune), said: Like all parts of the country, Shanxi, under the correct leadership of the Party, has undergone a year of hard work by the people of the province, and the low-yield appearance of agriculture has been significantly changed. The total grain output of the province this year has more than doubled compared to last year. He then reported to the conference on the achievements of the Jinxing People's Commune he led in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and in running industry on a large scale this year. He said that in 1958, the total grain output of the commune increased three and a half times compared to last year, with an average yield of two thousand and twelve jin per mu. The commune also built seven indigenous blast furnaces and fifty-seven various small factories. 70% of the commune's male and female labor force has achieved "farmers in the fields and workers in the factories." The total income of the commune increased by 70.5% compared to last year, and the average income per person increased by 80% compared to last year, with an average of one thousand six hundred and forty jin of grain per person.

Xu Dejian, the representative of Shanghai Municipality (Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee), said: 1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward. Under the leadership of the Party, the agricultural production in the suburbs of Shanghai, like the rural areas in all parts of the country, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In addition to the increase in grain and cotton production, vegetable production has also developed. This year, 16 new varieties of vegetables have been added in the suburbs, and there are now a total of 420 varieties of vegetables. Shanghai has also launched a large-scale movement to eliminate the "seven pests," promote hygiene, and eliminate diseases this year. After a year of fighting, the "seven pests" (rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, snails, bedbugs, cockroaches) have been severely hit. Xu Dejian said: In 1959, we must grasp grain and cotton production with one hand and non-staple food production with the other, so as to achieve a greater leap forward in both. We must strive to achieve "abundant grains, prosperous livestock, full ponds of fish, and ever-green vegetables" to meet the growing needs of the people in Shanghai.

Luo Shulan, the representative of Shaanxi Province (Secretary of the Party Branch of Huayuangou Production Team of Xianfeng People's Commune in Yulin County), said: This year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of Shaanxi Province have achieved great victories in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings with soaring enthusiasm and extremely high labor enthusiasm. In particular, the realization of communization has more powerfully promoted the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings. The steel production task this year has been completed ahead of schedule. The total output of grain and cotton has more than doubled compared to last year. There has also been a significant increase in large and small livestock, and the conception rate of female animals has reached more than 80%. The annual afforestation area is nearly 20 million mu, and in terms of water conservancy construction, a great miracle of surpassing thousands of years in one year has been created. The irrigated area in the province has increased to more than 32 million mu, and the area controlled for soil erosion has increased to 37%. The movement to eliminate "four pests" and promote hygiene has also achieved great results this year.

Zuo Keren, the representative of Jiangxi Province (Secretary of the Party Committee of Jinggangshan Reclamation Farm), said: In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the production and construction of our Jinggangshan have achieved unprecedented achievements. Jinggangshan, with its high mountains, cold weather, strong winds, and heavy fog, has achieved double-cropping rice, with a grain yield of nearly 800 jin per mu. The output of oil-bearing crops and other agricultural crops has also achieved a great harvest. Zuo Keren said: The common aspiration of all the people of Jinggangshan is: to build Jinggangshan, the cradle of the revolution, into a Jinggangshan with developed industry, agriculture, forestry, and other aspects, a Jinggangshan with prosperous culture, a Jinggangshan with abundant materials and a happy life, and a Jinggangshan with beautiful scenery. Strive to build Jinggangshan into the number one mountain in the world, so that Jinggangshan, the cradle of the revolution, will always stand at the forefront of the times.

Wang Yixiang, the representative of Jiangsu Province (Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry), said: The output of grain and cotton in Jiangsu Province this year has more than doubled compared to 1957, oil-bearing crops can increase by more than 60%, and the production of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery has also made considerable progress. This marks that the people of the province have taken a big step towards the road of abundant food and clothing. Wang Yixiang then introduced the situation of carrying out the patriotic health movement in Jiangsu Province. He said that after the test of the summer and autumn seasons, rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes have been greatly reduced, and schistosomiasis, which seriously endangers the health of the people of the province, has now been basically eliminated. This has effectively guaranteed the health of the people and enhanced the people's physique, providing more labor force for the development of production.

    力争粮食、棉花、油料和麻类、茶叶和蚕丝、畜牧业生产再跃进
    全面跨过农业生产“五关”
    推广今年跃进经验，坚持政治挂帅、群众路线，认真执行“八字宪法”
    全国农业先进单位代表会议听取廖鲁言报告和五个省市代表的发言
    新华社26日讯  全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议今天继续举行。中华人民共和国农业部部长、中共中央农村工作部副部长廖鲁言在会上作了关于农业问题的报告。山西、上海、陕西、江西、江苏等五个省（市）的代表在会上作了发言。
    廖鲁言在报告中谈了三个问题：（一）1958年农业生产大跃进；（二）争取1959年农业生产更大的丰收和全面的跃进；（三）统一认识，提高思想，搞好生产，搞好生活，把农村人民公社办得更好。
    在报告的第一部分里，廖鲁言说，1958年各种农作物增产的比例是空前的。全国粮食总产量达七千五百亿斤左右，比1957年增加一倍还多一点，一年增加三千八百亿斤左右，比第一个五年计划期间五年增加数的总和（一千八百亿斤）还多一倍以上。棉花总产量达六千七百万担左右，也比1957年增加一倍还多一点，一年增加三千四百万担，比上五年增加数的总和还多得多。油料、其他工业原料作物以及畜牧业等方面的增产比例，也都是过去所没有或者是少见的。他在分析今年农业跃进形势的特点时指出，今年农作物的单位面积产量增长的幅度比任何一年都大；从小麦到早稻到晚稻直到晚秋作物，产量一季比一季高；许多一向被认为是低产的作物和低产的地区，现在变成了高产，而高产作物和高产地区则更加高产。
    廖鲁言说，1958年的农业大跃进，有力地驳倒了某些人认为“农业生产不能快速发展”的悲观论调以及对于我国“人口多耕地少”的顾虑，同时也粉碎了资产阶级的“人口论”以及帝国主义反动派说我们“不能解决人口矛盾”的诅咒。
    廖鲁言又指出，在今年农业生产大跃进的同时，我国林业、渔业生产和农垦、水利建设以及气象事业也都一齐跃进，农业生产的大跃进同时也促进了社办工业、农村商业、交通、邮电、科学、文化教育、卫生等各项事业的发展。
    在谈到今年农业大跃进的经验时，廖鲁言指出了三点：第一，实行政治挂帅，加强党的领导；第二，发扬和发展党的群众路线的传统作风；第三，认真执行农业生产“八字宪法”（水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管）。廖鲁言说，必须把1958年的这些丰富的成功经验应用到1959年的工作中去。
    在报告的第二部分里，廖鲁言首先指出，虽然1958年农业战线的成就空前巨大，但是农业生产并没有完全过关。还要继续过好“五关”，这“五关”就是：粮食、棉花、油料和麻类、茶叶和蚕丝、畜牧业，为了适应人民生活不断增长的要求，在这些方面都还要大力增产。他还提出了1959年各类作物的增产具体要求。
    关于如何争取明年农业生产更大的丰收和全面的跃进，廖鲁言在报告中谈到了这样几个问题：当前要抓好越冬作物的田间管理、冬季生产、水利、积肥和备耕工作；要开展大面积高额丰产田运动，要切实执行“八字宪法”，耕作园田化；人民公社要做到农林牧副渔全面发展，使农、林、牧相互结合，相互依存，要执行工业和农业同时并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的生产方针，国营农场在这些方面要起模范作用。
    廖鲁言说，1959年粮棉增产计划仍然是一个跃进的计划，这个计划完全有可能完成，而且应该力争超过。一定要千方百计地争取1959年农业生产更大的丰收和全面的跃进。
    在报告的第三部分里，廖鲁言阐述了人民公社的性质和任务。
    在廖鲁言的报告以后，有五个省（市）的代表在今天的会上发言。
    山西省代表（金星人民公社主任）李顺达说：我们山西同全国各地一样，在党的正确领导下，经过全省人民一年的苦战，农业低产面貌已经显著改变，全省今年粮食总产量比去年增加了一倍还多。他接着向大会汇报了他所领导的金星人民公社在今年农业生产大跃进和大办工业的成就。他说，1958年，全社粮食总产量比去年增加了三倍半，每亩产量平均达到二千零十二斤。全社还办了七座土高炉和五十七个各种小型工厂，全社有70％的男女劳力已做到“下田是农民，进厂是工人”。全社总收入比去年增加70.5％，每人平均收入比去年提高80％，平均每人有一千六百四十斤粮食。
    上海市代表（中共上海市委农村工作部副部长）徐德建说：1958年是大跃进的一年，在党的领导下，上海郊区的农业生产，同全国各地农村一样，获得了空前大丰收。除了粮棉增产以外，蔬菜生产也有发展。今年郊区蔬菜增加新品种十六个，现在共有蔬菜品种四百二十个。上海市今年的除“七害”、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动也大规模地开展起来了。经过一年来的战斗，已经给“七害”（鼠、雀、蚊、蝇、钉螺、臭虫、蟑螂）以严重打击。徐德建说：1959年我们要一手抓粮棉生产，一手抓副食品生产，达到两者共同地更大地跃进。要求做到“五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，池塘鱼满，蔬菜常青”，以适应上海城市人民生活日益增长的需要。
    陕西省代表（榆林县先锋人民公社花园沟生产队党支部书记）罗树兰说：今年陕西省人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，以冲天的干劲和无比高涨的劳动热情，在工农业生产和各项建设事业上获得了巨大的胜利。特别是公社化的实现，更加有力地推动了工农业生产和各项建设事业的飞跃发展。今年的钢铁生产任务已提前完成。粮食和棉花的总产量都比去年增长了一倍以上。大小家畜也有显著增长，母畜受胎率达到80％以上。全年造林面积将近两千万亩，水利建设方面创造了一年胜过几千年的伟大奇迹，全省灌溉面积增加到三千二百多万亩，水土流失的控制面积提高到37％。除“四害”、讲卫生运动，今年也取得了很大的成绩。
    江西省代表（井冈山垦殖场党委书记）左克仁说：1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我们井冈山的生产建设取得了史无前例的成就。山高、天寒、风大、雾多的井冈山实现了水稻双季化，粮食产量每亩接近八百斤，油料及其他农作物的产量也获得了大丰收。左克仁说：井冈山全体人民的共同愿望是：要把革命摇篮——井冈山建设成工业、农业、林业及其他各方面发达的井冈山，文化繁荣的井冈山，物资丰富、生活幸福的井冈山，风景秀丽的井冈山，努力争取把井冈山建设成天下第一山，使井冈山这个革命摇篮永远站在时代的最前面。
    江苏省代表王一香（农林厅副厅长）说：江苏省今年的粮棉产量都比1957年增产一倍多，油料可增产六成多，林、牧、副、渔等项生产也都有相当大的发展。这标志着全省人民已经向丰衣足食的道路上跃进了一大步。王一香接着介绍了江苏省开展爱国卫生运动的情况。他说，经过夏、秋两季的考验，老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子大大减少了，严重危害全省人民身体健康的血吸虫病，现在已经基本消灭。这就有效地保障了人民的健康和增强了人民的体质，为发展生产提供了更多的劳动力。
