    "Kunlun" Factory on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway
    By our reporter Yang Liben

    Along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, there are now more than fifty factories, mines, farms, pastures, and forestry centers that have been put into production, with a total production value of about 50 million yuan this year. These factories, mines, farms, and pastures did not require state funding, but were established by the highway workers through their own efforts.

    When people travel by car through the Qarhan Salt Lake in the Qaidam Basin, they can see a factory on the lake at the southern end of the famous Ten-Thousand-Zhang Salt Bridge - the Kunlun Potash Fertilizer Plant, which produces both potash fertilizer and refined salt. Golmud is the location of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration. The automobile repair plant, brick and tile factory, clothing factory, and leather factory established by the Administration here have formed a new small production city. The automobile repair plant not only helps the petroleum and geological exploration departments in the Qaidam Basin repair and assemble automobiles, but also plans to manufacture drilling rigs, tractors, generators, new agricultural tools, etc., to directly support the development and construction of the basin.

    The workers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway like to proudly call Nachitai in the Kunlun Mountains "our industrial base." According to legend, when Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty entered Tibet, she abandoned the copper Buddha seat in this barren land because it was difficult for people and horses to travel (Nachitai means Buddha statue in Mongolian, and Nachitai is named after this legend). Now the roads here are no longer as difficult as when Princess Wencheng entered Tibet. Here, there are not only iron plants, coal plants, and refractory material plants, but also cement, lime, and other factories and mines.

    The workers have a great enthusiasm for developing local resources. When they discover mineral deposits near the highway, they organize people to mine them; when the highway passes through grasslands, they send people to establish pastures; when it passes through forest areas, they establish forestry centers. When they encounter a shortage of labor, they organize the family members of the workers to participate in labor. These factories and mining enterprises that have sprung up on the plains are all named "Kunlun," symbolizing the people's ambition and determination to develop and build the vast areas of the motherland, which is as unshakable as the Kunlun Mountains.

    All fourteen highway maintenance sections along the line are responsible for developing each section while maintaining the highway. Gas stations, rest stops, and road maintenance teams located every ten kilometers along the line have also built houses and taken root locally to raise sheep and grow vegetables. Over the years, the workers have found more than fifty mineral deposits, half of which were discovered by the road maintenance workers.

    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway began construction in May 1954. From the first day of construction, the Party organization of the Highway Bureau required all employees to be determined to both build the highway and build society. The slogan they put forward was "Not only will the highway serve the people of all ethnic groups along the route, but also the development of resources and production will serve the highway." Specifically, it is necessary to create living conditions for the highway workers in the sparsely populated plateau; to develop production, provide sufficient resources, and reduce transportation costs; to develop production, enable the family members of the workers to be employed, and enable the workers to settle down with peace of mind. After several years of hard work, living conditions have improved day by day, and the materials that can be transported along the route have increased day by day. The family members of the workers have all become female workers, and have settled down and established businesses on the plateau.

    Recently, the Party Committee of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration has initially put forward a five-year plan to change the backwardness of the areas along the route based on the current situation and existing foundation. According to this plan, the highway trunk line will be gradually paved with cement and asphalt; the number of production factories and mines will be many times more than it is now. This plan has been warmly supported by all the workers along the line. They said: The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is our home, and we guarantee to go all out and do unprecedented things, so that the flowers of industrial and agricultural construction will bloom all over the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

### 青藏公路上的“昆仑”工厂

    青藏公路上的“昆仑”工厂
    本报记者  杨立本
    在青藏公路的沿线，现在已有五十多个工厂、矿山、农场、牧场、林场投入了生产，今年的生产总值可以达到五千万元左右。这些厂矿和农牧场没有要国家出钱，而是由公路职工白手起家办起来的。
    当人们乘车通过柴达木盆地的察尔汗盐湖时，在著名的万丈盐桥南端可以看到一座湖上工厂——昆仑钾肥厂，这座工厂既生产钾肥又生产精盐。格尔木是青藏公路管理局所在地，管理局在这里创办的汽车修配厂、砖瓦厂、被服厂、皮革厂，使这里形成了一座新兴的小型生产城市。汽车修配厂不仅帮助柴达木盆地的石油、地质勘探部门修配汽车，还打算制造钻机、拖拉机、发电机、新式农具等，直接支援盆地的开发和建设。
    青藏公路的职工们喜欢用自豪的语气称呼昆仑山中的纳赤台为“我们的工业基地”。传说中的唐朝文成公主进藏时，由于人马难行而丢弃铜佛座台的不毛之地，（纳赤是蒙语佛像的意思，纳赤台由这个传说得名），现在这里的道路已经不像文成公主进藏时那样艰难。这里，不仅有了铁厂、煤厂、耐火材料厂，还有水泥、石灰等厂矿。
    职工们开发当地资源积极性很大，当职工们发现公路附近有矿藏时，他们就组织人去开矿；当公路通过草原时，他们就派人去办牧场；通过林区时就办林场。当他们碰到劳动力不足的时候，就组织职工家属参加劳动。这些平地突起的厂矿企业，都被冠以“昆仑”的名称，这象征着人们开发和建设祖国辽阔地区的雄心和壮志，就像昆仑山一样是不可动摇的。
    全线十四个公路养护段在养护公路的同时承担着开发各段的任务。沿线的加油站、食宿站和每隔十公里一个的养路班，也都盖起了房子，就地生根开花，养羊种菜。几年来职工们找到的五十多处矿点，就有半数是依靠养路工人发现的。
    青藏公路是1954年5月开始修筑的。从开工的第一天起，公路局党组织就要求全体职工下定既要建设公路又要建设社会的决心。他们提出的口号是“不仅公路为沿线的各族人民服务，还要以开发资源、发展生产为公路服务”。具体地说，要在人烟稀少的高原，为公路职工创造生活条件；发展生产，提供充足的资源，降低运输成本；发展生产，让职工家属就业，使职工安心扎根。经过几年的艰苦奋斗，生活条件一天天好转，沿线可供运出的物资一天天多起来。职工家属个个都成了女工，在高原上安家立业定居下来了。
    最近，青藏公路管理局党委根据目前形势和现有基础，初步提出了改变沿线落后面貌的五年计划。根据这个计划，公路干线要逐渐铺成水泥、沥青路面；生产厂矿要比现在多好多倍。这个计划受到了全线职工的热烈拥护。他们说：青藏高原就是我们的家，我们保证鼓足干劲，干前无古人的事业，让工农业建设的花朵开遍青藏公路沿线。（附图片）
