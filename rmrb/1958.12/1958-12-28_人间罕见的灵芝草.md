    Humanly Rare Lingzhi Mushroom

    Recently, the medicinal plant collection team of the Anhui Province Pharmaceutical Company obtained a precious medicinal Lingzhi mushroom, which was identified as "Rou Lingzhi" (Meat Lingzhi). This humanly rare Lingzhi mushroom was collected by an old medicine farmer named Yang from Dayang Lake in Taiping County, Anhui Province. In March of this year, when he was collecting rock tripe on the back peak of Lion Ridge, he noticed what looked like flashes of electricity in the crevices of the cliffs, which were over 60 zhang high. He used four 12-zhang long ropes to tie together and climbed up to collect it.

    This "Rou Lingzhi" is shaped like a deer antler, divided into two main branches, with many smaller branches on the larger ones. The whole plant is vermilion in color, reaching a height of 49 centimeters. The back of the large leaves and the root are all milky white. The leaves are green, and upon closer inspection, there are a few purple-golden small yellow spots. The base of the root shines with a lacquer-like luster.

    Li Shizhen’s “Compendium of Materia Medica” records, “Lingzhi is divided into Rock Lingzhi, Wood Lingzhi, Meat Lingzhi, and Mushroom Lingzhi, totaling several hundred species… Meat Lingzhi is shaped like meat, attached to large rocks, with both head and tail, and is a living thing.” The Chinese Plant Atlas says it belongs to the “Polyporaceae family” and also to the “Lingzhi family.” People consume it for its health benefits. As for its true efficacy, it still awaits research by medical workers. (Tianjin)

    人间罕见的灵芝草
    最近安徽省药材公司药用植物采集组得到一株珍贵药物灵芝草，经人鉴定为“肉灵芝”。这株人间罕见的灵芝草，是安徽省太平县大洋湖一位姓杨的老药农采到的。今年3月，他在狮子岭后峰采集石耳的时候，发现六十多丈高的悬岩石缝中，好像有电光闪闪，就用四根十二丈的长绳结起攀上去采下来。
    这株“肉灵芝”的形状与鹿角相似，分两大杈，大杈又分很多小杈。全株呈朱红色，高达四十九公分，大叶背面和根部全呈乳白色，叶绿，细看有几粒紫金色小黄斑，靠根部放出黑漆般的光泽。
    李时珍“本草纲目”中记载“芝分石芝、木芝、肉芝、菌芝凡数百种也……肉芝状如肉，附于大石，头尾俱有，乃生物也。”中国植物图鉴上说是“多孔蕈科”，又为“灵芝科”，人们服食可以有益健康。至于它的真正功效，还有待医务工作者的研究。（津）
