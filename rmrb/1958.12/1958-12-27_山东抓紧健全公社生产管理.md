Benbao Jinan, December 26th - The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has brought unlimited vitality to the work of rectifying and consolidating people's communes in Shandong Province. Currently, Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province and production and livelihood inspection teams at all levels are studying, publicizing, summarizing, and inspecting simultaneously, using the Central Committee's resolution to arm the minds of the entire Party and all the people.

Under the deep promotion of the ten-thousand-person inspection team, the first batch of pilot projects for rectifying and consolidating communes in Shandong Province is nearing completion. Based on the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee analyzed the progress of the current pilot work of commune rectification, summarized the preliminary experience of running communes on a large scale in various places, and prepared to conduct a large-scale collective training for the staff of the provincial inspection team. By studying the central documents and the experience of commune rectification, they will raise their awareness, and then conduct a thorough, sustained, and comprehensive large-scale inspection. Currently, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have put forward several new measures, demanding that the work of rectifying and consolidating communes be pushed to a new climax.

First, it is required that all localities extensively explain and publicize the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" to the entire Party and all the people, clearly expounding a series of issues related to people's communes from the aspects of theory, principles and policies, and organizational systems, clarifying certain confused understandings, arming the minds of the entire Party and all the people, and carrying out mass-based commune rectification work. Local production and livelihood inspection teams are also propaganda teams, and must study, publicize, summarize, and inspect simultaneously.

Second, on the issue of commune distribution, it is necessary to clearly grasp several principles: to ensure that more than 90% of commune members increase their income compared to the previous year, and that the income of the remaining commune members does not decrease compared to the previous year; under the principle of unified distribution by the commune, the agricultural cooperatives that originally had large increases in production should implement the policy of rewarding overproduction; a portion of the commune members' rations should be distributed to each household for their own use by small families; the supply portion should not be too large, and the wage system portion should be appropriately expanded, and the wages paid to commune members must be in the hands of the masses, and economic departments should not deduct them arbitrarily; the manure money and cash investments of the masses should be returned to the commune members as much as possible, and other debts should also have clear loan and repayment procedures. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee believes that only by grasping these provisions can the living arrangements of commune members be effectively arranged.

Third, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee especially summarized the experience of production management in people's communes in various places, and put forward several regulations on production management in people's communes, requiring all localities to firmly grasp the central link of production management in the rectification and consolidation of people's communes, and quickly and universally realize the democratization of production management, the institutionalization of production and living responsibility systems, and the normalization of labor order. According to this requirement, the regulations stipulate that under the principle of unified leadership and graded management, communes implement three-level management: commune, management area (or production brigade - the same below), and production team. The three levels should have clearly defined scopes of authority and management in terms of production plans, industry, agriculture, capital construction, and financial management. After the three-level division of management power, the commune and the management area should earnestly respect the rights of the production team, and effectively help the production team establish a responsibility system in production and life, so that the production team truly becomes the basic unit for organizing labor production under the unified leadership of the commune.

Regarding how to establish a production responsibility system, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee put forward six measures: (1) Rural communes should implement six assignments to the team for agricultural production management, that is, assigning cultivation areas, assigning labor, assigning output, assigning measures, assigning financial expenditures, and assigning responsibility for livestock and farm implements. (2) Production teams should implement "four assignments" to the field for field management, that is, assigning output, assigning measures, assigning production costs, and assigning management personnel. Regular inspections and comparisons should also be implemented. (3) Continue to implement the labor quota system in various agricultural tasks. In general, the method of assigning tasks, assigning quality, assigning quantity, assigning time, and assigning personnel can be used to assess labor quotas for various agricultural tasks, and contract them to production teams, production groups, or individuals to be responsible for completion according to the quota standards. (4) Continue to implement the small-section planning system. (5) Improve and consolidate the system of periodic evaluations, competitions, and awards. (6) Establish a labor attendance system for commune members.

In order to establish and consolidate the production responsibility system, Shandong Province's practice has proven that it is also necessary to correctly handle the relationship between the production team's routine production and the large-scale collaboration of "large-scale corps operations." Under certain conditions, it is beneficial to complete certain production tasks with "large-scale corps operations"; however, if "large-scale corps operations" are used to replace the production team's routine production activities, and the division of contracting and responsibility system is abolished, it will bring chaos to labor management and be detrimental to production. Therefore, within a commune, it is necessary to organize appropriate large-scale collaboration of "large-scale corps operations" based on production needs, on the basis of consolidating the production team's responsibility system. The rights of the county-level cooperative to dispatch the manpower, materials, and financial resources of various rural communes must also be appropriately regulated. Normal production and emergency tasks, large-scale corps operations and the responsibility system must be comprehensively planned and arranged. The county-level cooperative should encourage voluntary cooperation between communes in order to adjust their busy and slack seasons and promote this spirit of communist cooperation.

On the organization of labor, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee believe that all communes should strengthen planning. According to the needs of the three aspects of industrial and agricultural production tasks, aquatic products, and service tasks, it is generally necessary to organize three basic labor teams to be responsible for their respective tasks. At the same time, labor should also be rationally allocated and dispatched between production departments, routine production, emergency production, and service production to avoid taking care of one thing and losing sight of another. The organization of production teams must be fixed, and a number of groups should be divided below the team. In the division of labor, in general, work should be divided and specialized according to agricultural production's experimental fields, satellite fields, basic high-yield fields and general farmland, breeding management, handicrafts, and service-oriented canteens, nurseries, etc., so that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries can be comprehensively developed.

When calling on cadres at all levels to promote these advanced management experiences, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee emphasized promoting democracy, following the mass line, and the style of consulting with the masses on everything; it emphasized promoting a pragmatic work style; and it put forward a code of conduct for commune cadres as a reliable guarantee for implementing the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    山东抓紧健全公社生产管理
    本报济南26日电  中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，给山东省的整顿和巩固人民公社工作，带来无限的生命力。现在，山东省各级党委和各级生产生活检查团，正在边学习、边宣传、边总结、边检查，用中央的决议武装全党全民的思想。
    山东省整顿巩固公社的工作，在万人检查团的深入推动下，第一批试点工作即将结束。中共山东省委和省人民委员会，根据中共八届六中全会决议的精神，分析了当前整社试点工作的进展情况，总结了各地大办公社的初步经验，准备把全省检查团的工作人员进行一次大集训，通过学习中央文件和整社经验，提高思想，然后再深入持久全面地开展大检查。现在，省委和省人委已提出了几项新的措施，要求把整顿巩固公社工作推向高潮。
    首先，要求各地大规模向全党全民讲解和宣传“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，从理论上、方针政策上、组织制度上明确地阐述有关人民公社的一系列问题，澄清某些糊涂认识，武装全党全民的思想，开展群众性的整社工作。各地生产生活检查团，同时也是宣传团，要边学习，边宣传，边总结，边检查。
    其次，在公社分配问题上，要明确掌握好几个原则：使90％以上的社员比上年增加收入，其余的社员的收入比上年不减少；公社在统一分配的原则下，对原来增产幅度大的农业社，要执行超产奖励政策；社员口粮要拿出一部分分给各户归小家庭自己使用；供给部分不要太多，适当扩大工资制部分，发放给社员的工资，一定要放在群众手里，经济部门不能随便乱扣；群众的粪钱和现金投资，尽量全部归还给社员，其他债务也要明确贷还手续。山东省委认为，只有把这几条规定掌握好，才能有效地安排好社员的生活问题。
    第三，山东省委和省人民委员会特别总结了各地人民公社生产管理的经验，提出了关于人民公社生产管理的若干规定，要求各地在整顿巩固人民公社中，紧紧抓住生产管理这一中心环节，迅速而普遍地实现生产管理民主化、生产生活责任制度化，劳动秩序正常化。根据这个要求，规定公社在统一领导分级管理的原则下，实行公社、管理区（或生产大队——下同）、生产队三级管理。三级在生产计划、工业、农业、基本建设、财务管理等方面，都要划分明确的职权管理范围。三级分权管理以后，公社和管理区要认真尊重生产队的权利，并切实帮助生产队建立起生产、生活上的责任制，使生产队真正成为在公社统一领导下组织劳动生产的基本单位。
    关于如何建立生产责任制，山东省委、省人委提出了六项措施：（1）乡公社对于农业生产管理应实行六定到队。即定耕作区、定劳力、定产量、定措施、定财务开支、定牲畜农具的责任。（2）生产队对于田间管理实行“四定”到田。即定产量、定措施、定生产成本、定管理人员。并实行定期检查评比。（3）在各项农活中继续实行劳动定额制度。一般情况下，都可以采用定任务、定质、定量、定时间、定人员的办法，评定各项农活的劳动定额，并按照定额的标准包到生产队、生产组或个人去负责完成。（4）继续贯彻执行小段计划制度。（5）健全与巩固定期评比竞赛和评奖制。（6）建立社员劳动考勤制度。
    为了建立与巩固生产责任制，山东省的实践证明：还必须正确处理生产队的经常性生产与“大兵团作战”的大协作的关系。在一定的条件下完成一定的生产任务，“大兵团作战”是有好处的；但是如果以“大兵团作战”来代替生产队的经常性生产行动，取消分层包干和责任制，就会给劳动管理带来混乱，对生产是不利的。因此，在一个公社之内，必须在巩固生产队责任制的基础上，根据生产需要，组织适当的“大兵团作战”大协作。县联社调度各乡公社的人力物力财力的权利，也必须作适当的规定。必须把正常生产和突击任务，把大兵团作战和责任制，统筹规划，全面安排。公社与公社之间，为了互相调剂忙闲，自愿协作的，县联社应当加以鼓励，以发扬这种共产主义的协作精神。
    在劳动力的组织上，山东省委和省人委认为，各公社应加强计划性。要根据工、农业生产任务，水产和服务性任务三个方面的需要，一般要分别组织三支基本劳动队伍，各负专责。同时还应在生产部门之间，经常性生产、突击性生产、服务性生产之间，合理地分配和调度劳动力，以免顾此失彼。生产队的组织必须是固定的，队以下划分若干小组。在劳动分工上，一般应按照农业生产的试验田、卫星田、基本丰产田及一般农田、饲养管理、手工业、服务性的食堂、托儿所等专业，进行分工分业，使农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展。
    中共山东省委在号召各级干部推广这些先进的管理经验时，强调发扬民主，走群众路线，有事和群众商量的作风，强调发扬实事求是的工作作风；并且对公社干部提出了守则，作为贯彻执行中共八届六中全会决议的可靠保证。
