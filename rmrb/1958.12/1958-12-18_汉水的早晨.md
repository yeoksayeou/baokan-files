    Morning on the Han River
    Ji Xuepei

    In the early morning, the sky is a sheet of tile blue. The low mountains on both banks of the Han River are shrouded in a milky white mist.

    Now it is the dry season, and the Han River appears gentle and quiet; the dark green surface of the river doesn't even have a ripple. If it weren't for the occasional swirl suddenly rising on the river, you might think the river was completely still.

    The morning mist is getting thicker and thicker. The continuous mountain range on the opposite bank can now only be distinguished by its outline; it looks like a caravan of camels, stopping on the opposite bank of the river.

    Beneath a black mountain peak, several large wooden boats are moored, with countless black dots moving around them, as if loading and unloading cargo.

    Suddenly, a boatman's chant drifts from the river:

    "Hi...ho ho ho..."

    The sound is initially subtle and faint, intermittent. But in an instant, this sound roars across the river; and soon, the same chant echoes from near and far.

    Where are all these chants coming from? I look around the river, but all I find is the calm surface of the river and the thick fog floating above it. But when I turn my head, a long fleet of boats is already speeding down from upstream. Only then do I realize that my ears were deceived: the chants from before were actually echoes sent out by the valley.

    This long fleet of boats has at least twenty vessels, one chasing the tail of the other, in mutual pursuit. In the blink of an eye, the fleet has flown to the center of the river opposite me. The entire valley is then filled with noise:

    "Hi...ho ho ho..."

    It seems to me that this sound is not just coming from the boats; the mountains are shouting, the valley is shouting, and the river is also shouting... It is rugged and heroic, magnificent and charming. It is the sound of conquerors! The sound of victory! The sound of joy shouted out with all one's heart!

    Just then, someone on the dock across the river shouts:

    "Hey! Old in-law, what are you loading this time?"

    "Grain, lumber...and rice straw!" An old man on the boat asks, half-laughing, half-shouting, "When are you setting sail?" "We'll set sail in a little while!" someone from the dock replies.

    "Let's meet at Danjiangkou!" the old man says with a smile, "We'll take the first step!..."

    The large wooden boat drags the old man's laughter, scattering it on the river; in the blink of an eye, the fleet is no longer visible.

    Afterward, it returns to its original tranquility. However, the waves stirred up by the fleet have not yet completely subsided; they collide and push against each other, as if they have just seen off guests and are trying to find their original positions.

    Slowly, I notice that the color of the river has turned a powder blue; but soon, it turns into a light red; then, it completely becomes a deep red again...

    I am amazed by this magical transformation. I look up and see that half of the eastern sky has been burned red by the sunlight.

    The thick fog is slowly dissipating. The mountains on both banks of the Han River are gradually regaining their original appearance. As a red sun quietly rises from behind the mountains on the opposite bank of the Han River, several large wooden boats, fully loaded with materials for the construction of the Danjiangkou Reservoir, slowly leave the dock on the opposite bank and set off downstream. ...

    汉水的早晨
    吉学霈
    清晨，天空一片瓦蓝色。汉水两岸低矮矮的群山，被一抹乳白色的薄雾笼罩着。
    现在是枯水季节，汉水显得温柔而文静；暗青的江面上，甚至连点波纹都没有；要不是偶然江面上突然起个旋儿，你还以为江水完全是静止的呢。
    晨雾越来越浓了。对岸绵绵的山岭，现在只能辨出个轮廓；那样子好像一队骆驼，停足在江的对岸。
    在一座乌黑的山头下面，停泊着几只大木船，数不清的黑点子在它们周围晃动着，像是在装卸货物。
    突然，从江面上飘来一阵号子：
    “嗨……嗬嗬嗬……”
    这声音先是有点儿细微，并且隐隐约约，若断若续。但是只一刹，这种声音就在江面上轰响起来；随着，远远近近都响起了同样的号子。
    哪儿来的这许多号子声？我在江面上四处找：但找来找去，除过那平静的江面，和凝浮在它上空的浓雾以外，什么也没有找到；但是当我一转头，一条长长的船队已从上游飞速的飘下来了。这时，我才知道自己的耳朵受了骗：原来刚才的号子都是山谷里送出来的回声。
    这一条长长的船队至少有二十只，一只衔着一只的尾巴，在互相追逐。转眼间，船队已经飞到我对面的江心了。整个河谷于是都喧闹起来：
    “嗨…嗬嗬嗬…”
    我仿佛觉得，这声音不像只是从船上发出的，山在喊、河谷在喊，江水也在喊……它粗犷而又豪迈，雄壮而又眛人。这是征服者的声音！胜利的声音！用全部心胸呼出来的欢乐的声音！
    正在这当儿，对岸码头上有人喊：
    “喂！老亲家，你们这次装的啥？”
    “粮食、木料……还有稻谷草！”船上一个老汉半笑半喊的问：“你们什么时候起锚呀？”“一会儿就起锚！”码头上的人回答。
    “丹江口见面吧！”老汉笑道：“我们先走一步了！……”
    大木船拖着老汉的笑声，撒在江面上；转眼间，船队已经看不见了。
    接着，这里又恢复了原来的平静。然而江水被船队激的波浪，现在并未完全平息；它们互相冲撞着、推拥着，好像刚刚送走了客人，自己要找到自己原来的位置。
    慢慢的，我注意到江水的颜色已经变成粉青色了；可是不久，又转成了淡红色；接着，完全又成深红色。……
    我为这种神奇的变幻所惊倒。抬头一看，原来东方半拉天，已被阳光烧得通红。
    浓雾慢慢在消散着。汉水两岸的群山，逐渐在恢复着它们原来的面貌。当一轮红日悄悄的从汉江对岸的山后面升起来的时候，有几只大木船满载着建设丹江水库的物资，徐徐的离开了对岸的码头，向下游出发了。……〔苗地插图〕
