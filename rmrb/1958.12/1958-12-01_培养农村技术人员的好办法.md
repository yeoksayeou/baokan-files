Editorial Note:

	The joint establishment of various vocational schools by factories, enterprises, government organs, and people's communes in the Liu'an Special District of Anhui Province is a new form of mass education and a good way to mobilize all forces to rapidly train various technical talents for the people's communes.

	With the establishment of people's communes, the integration of industry and agriculture, and the combination of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, the need for various technical forces is becoming increasingly urgent. Currently, many people's communes are relying on their own strength to vigorously run technical schools for industry, agriculture, medicine, etc., and various forms of Red and Expert Universities to improve the cultural and technical level of their members and solve the needs of production technology. However, some communes face certain difficulties in running schools. The joint operation of schools by factories, enterprises, government organs, and people's communes may appropriately solve some of these difficulties. Factories, enterprises, and government organs have a group of on-the-job cadres, technicians, and technical personnel with culture, technology, and practical work experience, which can solve the difficulty of teachers; these units have production sites, which can solve the problems of teaching and practical operation for students. Joint operation of schools by factories, enterprises, government organs, and communes is a form of communist cooperation and support for the people's communes. This method is very good and worth learning.

    培养农村技术人员的好办法
    安徽省六安专区工厂、企业、机关和人民公社联合创办了各种职业学校，是群众办学的一种新的形式，是动员各方面的力量为人民公社迅速培养各种技术人才的一个好办法。
    随着人民公社的建立，工农业并举，农林牧副渔结合，对于各种技术力量的需要就愈来愈迫切。现在，许多人民公社正在依靠自己的力量大办工、农、医师等技术学校，办各种形式的红专大学，以提高社员的文化技术水平，解决生产技术上的需要。但某些公社在办学中是有若干困难的。而工厂、企业、机关和人民公社联合办学校，某些困难就可能得到适当解决。各工厂、企业、机关有一批有文化、有技术、有实际工作经验的在职干部、技术人员，可以解决师资的困难；这些单位有生产场地，可以解决教学和学生实际操作的问题。工厂、企业、机关和公社合办学校，是一种共产主义的协作，是对人民公社的支援。这种办法很好，值得学习。
