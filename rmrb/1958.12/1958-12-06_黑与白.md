"Black and White"
    Xie Fengsong

    In early March, the weather was still very cold. A section of the river behind my house had been dredged, and the people from the production team were going down to the river to collect grass manure. After breakfast, the men and women took off their straw sandals, rolled up their trousers, and went to work with their pitchforks, full of enthusiasm. At that time, I was still wearing leather shoes and wool socks. Seeing them leave, I made up my mind, took off my shoes and socks, grabbed a pitchfork, and chased after them. I hadn't gone more than a few steps when the team leader stopped me. He said, "Comrade Xie, you can't do this kind of work. The weather is too cold; besides, there are lots of broken bricks and tiles in the back river. Feet like yours would get cut at the slightest touch. Don't rush, there will be work for you to do later!" When he said that, a group of children gathered around like they were watching a show. They touched my legs and feet, chattering, "So white!" "Oh, so white!" This attracted the attention of some curious young men who also turned back. Little Ni, who was quite familiar with me, said with a hint of mockery, "Old Xie, your feet are like tofu, so white and tender!" I didn't say a word, pushed through the crowd, and jumped into the river in one breath.

    As soon as I jumped in, my feet touched the soft mud and the broken bricks and tiles. I immediately felt a strange itching sensation, which was really uncomfortable. The wind was also sharp, piercing my legs. I gritted my teeth and worked with everyone for a whole day.

    That night, I lay in bed unable to sleep. I thought: I grew up in the countryside, among the peasants, and no one had ever pointed at my feet and said, "So white!" "So white!" Nor had anyone ever looked at me in a special way. I remember in the spring of 1951, when I was assigned to work in an office after graduating from school, I still went to work barefoot, and people criticized me for having a "peasant style." Later, life changed, and habits changed too. First, I bought rubber shoes, and then I bought leather shoes; wearing leather shoes, naturally, I also had to wear socks. In the blink of an eye, seven or eight years had passed. After seven or eight years of not taking off my shoes and socks, how could my feet not be white?

    Then I thought again, this is not just a matter of my feet getting whiter, but also a matter of drifting further and further away from the countryside and the peasants in terms of emotions and interests. The leaders I had been following were old comrades from Yan'an. After they entered the city, they always wore coarse clothes and cloth shoes, and their lives were very simple and unpretentious. I didn't quite understand this before. Now, I truly understand in my heart how wise and correct the Party's policy of sending cadres down to the countryside is.

    More than half a year has passed. During these days, I have been with the peasants, learning new farming skills from them, and doing new farming work with them. Day after day, I have been basking in the sun and rain, with my arms bare and my feet bare. Now, my face is dark, my hands are dark, and my feet are dark too. Living with the peasants, walking with them, and working with them, I gradually feel no sense of distance and as close as brothers. The small team leader no longer picks easy jobs for me, but treats me the same as other team members; and his way of addressing me is no longer the very polite and cautious "Comrade Xie," but the very kind and casual "Old Xie."

    Black and white, this is not just a difference in skin color, but in essence, it is a dividing line in thoughts and feelings.

    “黑与白”
    谢逢松
    3月初，天气还很冷。家后头干了一段河，小队里的人要下河去搪草粪。吃过早饭，男的女的都脱去蒲鞋，卷起裤脚，拿着飞叉，兴高采烈地去上工了。那时，我还穿着皮鞋和毛袜子。看他们去了，我也就下了狠心，脱去鞋袜，拿着一把飞叉，追了上去。走不到几步，就被队长拦住。他说：“谢同志，这活你可不能玩。天气怪冷的；再说后河里碎砖瓦片多得很，像你这样的脚一碰就破。你别忙呀，以后有你干的活呢！”给他这么一嚷，一群小孩子像看戏似的，围了上来。他们摸着我的腿，打着我的脚，七嘴八舌地：“多白呀！”“哎呀，真白呀！”这一来，那些好奇的小伙子也回头来了。那个和我较熟的小倪，含着几分嘲意地说：“老谢，你的脚真像水豆腐呀，又白又嫩！”我没有说半句话，拨开人群，一鼓气就跳下河去。
    刚跳下去时，脚底触着稀泥，触着破砖碎瓦，心里顿时掀起一阵阵的怪痒，实在难受。风也很利，一阵阵地往腿里刺。我咬着牙关，和大伙干了一个整天。
    晚上，我躺在床上一直睡不着觉。我想：我从小生活在农村，生活在农民中间，从来也没有人指着我的双脚说：“多白呀！”“多白呀！”也从来没有人用特殊的眼光来看待我。记得1951年春天，我从学校分配到机关工作时，上班还光着脚板子，人们还批评我，说是“农民作风”。以后，生活变了，习惯也变了。最先买胶鞋穿，随后买皮鞋穿；穿皮鞋，自然也就要穿袜子。这样，一转眼就是七、八年。七、八年不脱鞋不脱袜，脚怎么会不白呢？
    我再一想，这不仅是脚越来越白的问题，而是情感上、爱好上离开农村、离开农民越来越远的问题。我一直跟着的几个领导同志，是来自延安的老同志。他们进城之后，一直是穿着粗衣布鞋，生活非常随便，非常朴素，而以前，我对这是不大理解的。现在，我心里才真正明白：党这次的干部下放政策是何等英明，何等正确。
    半年多的时间过去了。在这些日子里，自己和农民在一起，向他们学着一套套的新农活，跟他们干着一套套的新农活。日日晒着太阳，沐着风雨，光着膀子，赤着双脚。现在，脸黑了，手黑了，脚也黑了。和农民生活在一块，行走在一块，劳动在一块，也就慢慢地觉得无所隔阂，亲如兄弟了。小队长再也不挑着轻活给我干，和其他队员“一视同仁”了；对我的称呼也不是很客气、很谨慎的“谢同志”。而是很亲切、很随便的“老谢”了。
    黑与白，这不仅是皮肤上的一种区别，实质上是思想感情上的一条界线。
