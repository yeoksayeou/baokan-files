Old Irrigation Areas Remodeled North and South of the Tianshan Mountains
High Efficiency Competition Launched on the Huaibei River Network Construction Site

According to Xinhua News Agency, the preliminary battle of water conservancy construction centered on the remodeling of old irrigation areas has begun among the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region this winter and next spring. While vigorously developing steel production, farmers in various parts of the Tianshan Mountains have drawn up labor forces to form large-scale water conservancy construction armies. The battle cry of the people of all ethnic groups is: work hard this winter, work hard next spring, and realize the engineering of canal systems, the irrigation of furrowed fields, and the scientific management.

Water conservancy construction centered on the remodeling of old irrigation areas is an important measure for Xinjiang to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest next year. Most of Xinjiang's farmland is uneven, with ridges all over, and chaotic channels. Small pieces of farmland are very irregular. Therefore, the phenomenon of water infiltration and loss in irrigation is quite serious, causing water shortages in the downstream of rivers, affecting the quality of farmland irrigation, and causing soil salinization. After the thorough reconstruction of the old irrigation area, the increased water volume alone can irrigate more than 100 million mu of cultivated land.

At present, water conservancy construction teams in various parts of the Tianshan Mountains have entered the battle. Moyu County at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains has formed a water conservancy construction corps of 30,000 people after 40,000 people went up the mountain to vigorously develop steel production. Pishan County has formed a capital construction group of 6,000 people, and Gashi County on the banks of the Kashgar River has organized a perennial water conservancy construction division of 3,000 people. This professional water conservancy construction team has high efficiency, good quality, and is easy to mobilize and train technicians. In October of this year, most people's communes in various places organized planning committees for the reconstruction of old irrigation areas and planned farmland channels, bridges, roads, forest belts, and vegetable gardens according to the new irrigation area. This winter, combined with deep plowing and planting, land leveling and channel renovation have been widely carried out. In the past, fields that were uneven, with ridges running vertically and horizontally, chaotic ditches, and shrubs and weeds all over the ridges, have now become flat farmland of hundreds or thousands of mu, which is convenient for mechanical farming. New irrigation canal systems have appeared on the farmland. The reconstructed irrigation area has generally increased the area of cultivated land and reduced water consumption. The area of cultivated land in the reconstructed irrigation area in Toksun County has increased by 15%, the number of watering personnel has been reduced by half, and the irrigation quota has been reduced from 100 cubic meters per mu in the past to 80 cubic meters.

Xinhua News Agency report: On the river network water conservancy construction site in the Huaibei Plain, Anhui Province, young migrant workers have launched a high-efficiency competition with the Zhang Youdao Youth Shock Brigade in Sixian County, and good news has been reported from all over the place.

The Rocket Class of the Red Flag Company of the Zhao Ji Township Water Conservancy Corps in Funan County, six young migrant workers, cooperated in using double-bladed plows to loosen the soil and using highly efficient turntable dump trucks to transport the soil, so as to ensure that the loading was waiting for the truck, and the truck was not waiting for the loading, eliminating the phenomenon of work stoppages. Within a transport distance of 40 meters, the average efficiency per person per day was more than 60 cubic meters. The 40 members of the "Red Glow Women's Team" on the Jienan New River construction site in Fuyang Prefecture displayed high revolutionary enthusiasm, all used small carts with bearings, and dug and pushed themselves, creating a record of 41.7 cubic meters per person on average over a 30-meter paved road.

In order to consolidate and sustainably develop the high-efficiency movement, the young people on the Huaibei water conservancy front are taking the lead in carrying out technological innovations. After repeated improvements with the members of the commune, the youths of the Huaiyuan County Water Conservancy Division have increased the efficiency of each soil loosening explosion to more than 60 cubic meters. The Zhao Ji Township Youth League organization in Yingshang County launched the activity of "Everyone learns technology and everyone becomes a craftsman" on the construction site, completely eliminating the phenomenon of carrying on shoulders and lifting by people on the construction site, realizing the rail transport of soil and the semi-mechanization of tools, so that the average efficiency increased from 5 cubic meters per person per day to 48 cubic meters.

### 天山南北改建旧灌区  淮北河网化工地开展高工效竞赛

    天山南北改建旧灌区
    淮北河网化工地开展高工效竞赛
    据新华社讯  新疆维吾尔自治区各族农民在今冬明春以改建旧灌区为中心的水利建设前哨战已经开始。天山南北各地农民，在大搞钢铁的同时，已纷纷抽调劳动力组成水利建设大军。各族农民的战斗口号是：苦干一冬，大干一春，实现渠系工程化、灌溉沟畦化、管理科学化。
    以改建旧灌区为中心的水利建设，是新疆争取明年农业大丰收的一项重要措施。新疆绝大部分农田，都是高低不平、田埂遍野、渠道紊乱，小块农田很不规则，因而灌溉上水的渗透和流失现象相当严重，造成河流下游缺水，并影响了农田灌溉质量和引起土地盐碱化。旧灌区彻底改建以后，仅增加的水量可增灌一亿多亩耕地。
    目前，天山南北各地的水利建设队伍已投入战斗。昆仑山下的墨玉县在四万人上山大搞钢铁以后，已组成三万人的水利建设兵团。皮山县组成了六千人的水利基建团，喀什噶尔河畔的伽师县组织了三千人的常年水利建设师。这种专业水利建设队伍工效高，质量好，便于调动和培养技术人员。今年10月，各地大部分人民公社都组织了改建旧灌区的规划委员会，按照新灌区规划了农田渠道、桥梁、道路、林带和菜园。今冬各地结合深翻土地和插种工作，普遍展开平整土地和整修渠道。过去高低不平、田埂纵横、沟道紊乱、灌木杂草遍田埂的田野，现在有许多已变成便于机械耕作的几百亩或上千亩的平坦农田，农田上出现了新的灌溉渠系。改建后的灌区普遍增加了耕地面积，减少了水的消耗量。托克逊县改建后的灌区耕地面积增加了15％，浇水人员减少了一半，灌水定额由过去每亩一百公方降低到八十公方。
    据新华社讯  安徽省淮北平原河网化水利工地上青年民工，掀起了一个和宿县张友道青年突击队开展高工效的竞赛热潮，捷报不断从各地传来。
    阜南县赵集乡水利团红旗连火箭班的六个青年民工，在使用双铧犁松土和使用效率很高的转盘斗车运土中，进行协作，做到装不等车，车不候装，消灭了窝工现象。在四十公尺运距内，一天每人平均工效为六十多公方。阜阳专区界南新河工地上的“红霞妇女队”四十名队员发扬了高度革命热情，全部使用轴承小车，自挖自推，在三十公尺铺上道板的运距内，创造了每人平均四十一点七公方的纪录。
    为了使高工效运动巩固持久地发展，淮北水利战线上的青年正在带头大搞技术革新。怀远县水利师青年和社员一道经过多次改进，已将每次松土爆破效率提高到六十公方以上。颍上县赵集乡团组织在工地上开展了“人人学技术、个个当工匠”的活动，在工地上彻底消灭肩挑人抬的现象，实现了运土铁轨化和工具半机械化，使平均工效由原来每人每天五方提高到四十八方。
