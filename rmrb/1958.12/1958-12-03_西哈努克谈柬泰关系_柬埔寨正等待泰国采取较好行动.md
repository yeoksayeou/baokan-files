Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 29th November (delayed dispatch) Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk, speaking to Xinhua reporters at Angkor Wat in Siem Reap Province on the evening of November 28th, said regarding Cambodian-Thai diplomatic relations that Cambodia is waiting for Thailand to take some better actions. If Thailand expresses willingness and deeper understanding, we will re-establish our diplomatic relations.

Sihanouk said that recently, Thai newspapers and radio stations, and even its politicians, have once again expressed hostile attitudes towards Cambodia. They have consistently attacked Cambodia, saying that Cambodia is a danger and threat to Thailand and the free world, and that Cambodia is attempting to invade its neighbors. They particularly attack Cambodia's relationship with People's China.

Prince Sihanouk told Xinhua reporters: "You know these accusations are untrue and baseless. Cambodia's relationship with People's China is very good. China is one of our most friendly countries. China provides us with unconditional economic assistance. Furthermore, Cambodia pursues a neutral and peaceful policy. We want to maintain good relations with all countries and pursue a good-neighborly policy. We only have a small army, how can we invade a country like Thailand, which has a large army?"

Sihanouk added: Because we took the initiative, I went to Bangkok to hold talks with Thai leaders in order to resolve some outstanding issues between us. He said: Cambodia showed a spirit of understanding, but the Thai government did not. They even organized demonstrations to oppose Cambodia. They also took other hostile measures. Prince Sihanouk said that under these circumstances, it was impossible to engage in diplomatic activities in Bangkok, so Cambodia decided to temporarily suspend diplomatic relations with Thailand.

He emphasized that this measure is not final, but temporary. Cambodia's embassy in Bangkok has left behind a chargé d'affaires.

    西哈努克谈柬泰关系
    柬埔寨正等待泰国采取较好行动
    新华社金边29日电（迟到）柬埔寨首相西哈努克11月28日晚上在暹粒省的吴哥窟对新华社记者谈到柬埔寨和泰国的外交关系时说，柬埔寨正在等待泰国方面采取某种较好的行动，如果泰国表示愿意和更深的谅解的话，我们就将重新建立我们的外交关系。
    西哈努克说，最近泰国报纸和电台，甚至它的政治家，都再次对柬埔寨表示敌对的态度，他们并且一贯攻击柬埔寨。他们说，柬埔寨对于泰国和自由国家是一种危险和威胁，他们还说，柬埔寨企图侵犯它的邻国。他们特别攻击柬埔寨同人民中国的关系。
    西哈努克亲王对新华社记者说：“你知道这些指责是不确实的，毫无根据的。柬埔寨和人民中国的关系是非常良好的。中国是我们的最友好的国家之一。中国在经济方面给予我们无条件的援助。此外，柬埔寨奉行中立及和平政策。我们要同一切国家保持良好关系，并且奉行一种睦邻政策。我们只有少量军队，我们怎么能侵犯像泰国那样的拥有大量军队的国家。”
    西哈努克又说：由于我们采取了主动，我曾经去曼谷同泰国的领袖们进行了会谈，以便解决我们之间存在的某些悬而未决的问题。他说：柬埔寨表现了谅解精神，而泰国政府却没有这么做。他们甚至组织游行示威来反对柬埔寨。他们还采取了其它敌对措施。西哈努克亲王说，在这种情况下，在曼谷从事外交活动是不可能的，因此柬埔寨决定暂时中断同泰国的外交关系。
    他强调说，这种措施并不是最后肯定的，而是暂时的。柬埔寨驻曼谷的大使馆还留下一位代办。
