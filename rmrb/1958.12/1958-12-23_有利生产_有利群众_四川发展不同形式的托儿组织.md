    Beneficial to Production, Beneficial to the Masses
    Sichuan Develops Various Forms of Childcare Organizations

    (By our correspondent) Sichuan is developing rural childcare organizations in various forms based on the principle of voluntary participation by the masses.

    Currently, the rural childcare organizations in Sichuan roughly take the following forms: (1) Daycare, providing care, education, meals, and daily living services (such as washing and mending); (2) Full-time care, providing meals, lodging, and education; (3) Half-day care, providing only education, without meals or lodging. Because of the variety of forms, adapted to the specific conditions of each locality and the demands of the masses, the masses are happy to send their children to nurseries and kindergartens. According to incomplete statistics, the province has already established more than 600,000 nurseries and kindergartens, caring for more than 10 million children, freeing more than 7 million mothers to devote themselves to production without worries.

    While vigorously developing childcare organizations in various forms, all localities have fully implemented the principle of "large collectives, small freedoms," both adhering to the needs of production and facilitating the masses. During the busy seasons of planting and harvesting, children can temporarily receive full-time care. When production is less busy or not so intense, other forms can be adopted as long as the mothers request it. The holidays for nurseries and kindergartens are also flexibly determined based on the busy and slack seasons of agriculture and the demands of the masses.

    有利生产  有利群众
    四川发展不同形式的托儿组织
    本报讯  四川各地根据群众自觉自愿的原则，采取多种多样的形式发展农村托儿组织。
    目前四川各地农村托儿组织大致有以下几种形式：（1）日托，管教、管吃、管日常生活（洗衣缝补等）；（2）全托，管吃、管住、管教；（3）半托，只管教，不管吃和住。由于形式多种多样，适合各地的具体条件和群众要求，群众都乐意把孩子送进托儿所、幼儿园。据不完全统计，全省已经办起的托儿所和幼儿园共有六十多万个，收托孩子一千多万人，使七百多万母亲无牵无挂地安心投入生产。
    各地采取各种形式大办托儿组织，同时充分贯彻了“大集体、小自由”的原则，既要服从生产，又要便利群众。在抢种、抢收时，孩子可以临时实行全托，一到生产空隙时间或不太紧张的时候，只要母亲要求，就可采取别的形式。托儿所、幼儿园的假期也是根据农忙农闲和群众要求灵活掌握。
