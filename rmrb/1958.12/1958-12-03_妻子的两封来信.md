    Two Letters From My Wife
    Liberation Army stationed in a certain unit in Guangxi, Bei Chen
    My wife used to work as a teacher in the army's kindergarten. When I was transferred last summer, she resigned and came with me. Then the army mobilized officers' families to return to their hometowns, but we had both been away from our hometowns for so long and had nothing there, which was a real problem. This spring, I was going to be transferred to work in Guangxi, and I couldn't cause any more trouble for the army, so I had her take our three children back to my hometown in Tanghe County, Henan Province, temporarily, and then we would think of another solution. After the Great Leap Forward, work in the countryside was busy, and the matter was put aside. I was still worried about it when she sent me two letters in a row...
    First Letter
    Bei Chen:
    Things have changed so quickly. Originally, the army kindergarten had agreed to let me go back to work, and had already sent a transfer request. But their letter came late, and I had already given up the idea of going back. I am not from Tanghe, but I love our commune and our kindergarten as much as I love my own hometown.
    I am very busy now. On the one hand, I am taking care of the children, and on the other hand, I am busy with construction and preparing for the toy and teaching aid exhibition. This time, the Party Committee reported the work to the county, and I was rated as a first-class model worker. I feel that the Party has given me too much honor, because if it were not for the leadership of the Party Committee and the support of the masses, what could I have done alone!
    I am actively preparing for an exhibition, hoping that this exhibition can play a certain role in kindergarten work and promote rural kindergarten work. Because I was rated as a model worker, comrades from the County Bureau of Culture and Education and the Bureau of Health often come to inspect our work and see our kindergarten. The Bureau of Culture and Education especially supports this exhibition and has proposed to organize kindergartens throughout the county to visit. In this case, how can I leave?
    Our kindergarten cooks for itself, and our life is not bad. We mainly eat millet, and also sorghum and white flour.
    My treatment has also been resolved. The Party Committee took into account my specific situation, and now, in addition to what the four of us eat, they subsidize me with 20 yuan per month, but I didn't take it, because the kindergarten workers here don't have this treatment yet. I want to work hard for a few months, and when the commune implements a new distribution system, everything will be better.
    My hometown is changing and will become a very beautiful city in the future. Meng Xia

    Second Letter
    Bei Chen:
    Everyone, as long as they are human, must admit that exciting things are happening everywhere, and the same is true here under the leadership of the Party.
    I have good news for you, we have started making steel here. I am preparing to take the children to the construction site tomorrow to perform and to comfort and congratulate the uncles and aunts on the steel front.
    In several evaluations, our commune has been a red flag. The comrades of the Party Committee here are very capable, and the people here are energetic all day long.
    Our commune's steel, iron, and kindergarten are all outstanding in the county. The Party Committee cares about the kindergarten very much, and now our kindergarten has its own funds, so we can buy cloth to make clothes and other supplies for the children. I have already made several sets of dance costumes for the children. If you can come back and see next year, everything will be very different.
    I don't want you to send money anymore, we all have our own income now.
                          Meng Xia

    妻子的两封来信
    解放军驻广西某部  北辰
    我的妻子原来在部队的幼儿园当教养员；去年夏季我调动工作时，她就退职一块走；接着部队动员军官家属返乡，但是我们又都是久离家乡，在家乡又一无所有，这真是一件难事。到今年春天我又要调到广西去工作，这再不能给部队找麻烦了，就让她带着三个孩子暂时回到我的家乡河南唐河县去，再想想别的办法。大跃进以后，农村里工作忙，这事也就搁下了。我还在为这事正发愁哩，不料她接连来了两封信……
    第一封信北辰：
    事情变得真快。原先，部队幼儿园已经同意我回去工作，而且已经来调了。可是他们的信来迟了，我早已打消了回去的念头。我不是唐河人，可是，我却像热爱自己的家乡一样热爱我们的公社和我们的幼儿园了。
    现在我可忙哩。一面搞孩子，一面忙于修建，还在准备玩具、教具展览；这次党委把工作汇报到了县里，我被评为一等模范。我觉得党给了我过高的荣誉，因为我在这工作如果不是党委的领导和群众的支持，我一个人能干出什么来呢！
    我在积极准备一次展览会，希望这次展览会能在幼儿园工作中起一定作用，把农村幼儿园工作推动一下；由于被评为模范，县文教局、卫生局的同志常常来检查我们的工作，看了我们的幼儿园；文教局特别支持这次展览会，还提出要组织全县的幼儿园来参观；在这种情况下我怎末能撒手走开呢？
    我们幼儿园自己起伙，我们的生活不坏，主要吃小米，另外还有高粱和白面。
    我的待遇也解决了，党委考虑到我的具体情况，现在除了我们四个人吃，每月还补贴我二十元，但我没去领，因为这里幼儿园的工作同志都还没有这样待遇，我想艰苦几个月，等到公社实行新的分配制后，一切就会更好了。
    家乡在变，将来也是一个很美丽的城市。  孟侠
    第二封信北辰：
    人，只要是人，谁也不能不承认，各处都在出现激动人心的事，我们这里在党的领导下也同样。
    告诉你一个喜讯，我们这里开始炼钢了。我已准备明天带着孩子们到工地去上演，去慰问和祝贺钢铁战线上的叔叔姑姑们。
    几次评比，我们的公社都是红旗；这里的党委同志们都很能干，这里的人们也是整天生气勃勃地干。
    我们公社的钢、铁和幼儿园在全县都是很出色的。党委对幼儿园很关心，现在我们幼儿园有了自己的经费，可以给孩子们买布作衣服和其他用品，我已经给孩子们搞了几套舞蹈服装；明年你如果能回来看看，一切就大不一样了。
    以后我不要你寄钱了，现在我们都有了自己的收入。
                          孟侠
