    Starting from Eating Together
    Zeng Zhi
    After hearing the news that the people's communes in Shang County, Shaanxi Province, had abolished the cadre mess halls and that cadres and commune members were eating together in public canteens, I remembered a story in the book "Around Chairman Mao": In August 1947, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao moved to Jia County, Shaanxi. Jia County was a place with poor land and impoverished people. The masses lived a hard life. Generally, poor farmers ate "qianqian rice" (a kind of thin gruel made with black beans, vegetables or wild herbs, and a small amount of millet). Chairman Mao asked the administrator to make this kind of rice for him as well. The administrator refused, but Chairman Mao said to him, "The folks here are living such a hard life, and there is so little grain. We have so many people in our organization and troops, why should I be so special? You must make ‘qianqian rice’ for me!"
    This story, though very simple, is thought-provoking, especially the sentence "Why should I be so special?" which reveals the relationship between our leaders and the masses.
    The relationship between our leaders and the masses is not like that in the old society, where it was antagonistic, with the leaders being exploiters and oppressors and the masses being the exploited and oppressed, and a fierce struggle unfolding between them. In our society, leadership is indispensable, but the masses are ordinary laborers, and the leaders are also ordinary laborers. In addition to the relationship of leadership and being led, they also have a relationship between one ordinary laborer and another. Therefore, apart from appearing as leaders in work—arranging work, inspecting work—everything else is equal. Precisely because of these two kinds of relationships, and because of the influence of the old society, the relationship between leaders and the masses easily obscures the equal relationship between people. Therefore, many leaders are always thinking of various ways to eliminate the estrangement between themselves and the masses. Especially after the rectification campaign, leading cadres went deep into the masses and paid attention to appearing as ordinary laborers in everything. Grassroots cadres have even achieved eating, living, and working together with the masses. The fact that cadres of the people's communes in Shang County eat together with the masses in the canteen reflects this relationship.
    Many cadres are able to frequently understand the opinions of the masses, and the masses dare to express their opinions to the cadres, precisely because the cadres can appear as ordinary laborers. Conversely, many cadres do not understand the opinions of the masses, and the masses are unwilling to express their opinions to the cadres, precisely because the cadres do not appear as ordinary laborers.
    When one does not yet possess the ideological style of an ordinary laborer, one cannot treat people equally everywhere, in work and in life. Taking the issue of cadres eating together with the masses as an example, it is clear that there are many benefits, and the relationship between leaders and the masses is closer. However, some people are reluctant to abolish the cadre mess halls, and are reluctant to go to the canteen to eat.
    Cadres eating together with the masses in the canteen seems like a small thing, but it is a big issue. May those who have not yet eaten with the masses in the canteen, think thrice!

    从一起吃饭谈起
    曾志
    听到陕西省商县各人民公社取消干部灶，干部和社员一起在公共食堂吃饭的消息后，就记起“在毛主席周围”一书中，有这样一段故事：1947年8月，党中央和毛主席转移到了陕北葭县。葭县是个地瘠民贫的地方，群众生活很苦，一般穷苦农民都吃“千千饭”（一种用黑豆加上瓜菜或野菜和少量小米煮成的稀饭），毛主席要管理员也给他做这种饭吃。管理员不肯，毛主席就对他说：“这里的老乡们生活这么苦，粮食又少，我们机关部队人又这么多，我为什么要那样特别呢？一定要给我做‘千千饭’！”
    这个故事虽很简单，却发人深省，特别是“我为什么要那样特别呢？”一句话，更道出了我们领导和群众的关系。
    我们的领导者和群众之间的关系，不像旧社会那样是敌对的，领导者是剥削者压迫者，群众是被剥削者被压迫者，两者之间，展开了激烈的斗争。在我们的社会里，领导是不可少的，但是，群众是一个普通劳动者，领导者也是一个普通劳动者。他们除了领导和被领导关系之外，又有一个普通劳动者和另一个普通劳动者之间的关系。因此，除了在工作上应该以领导者姿态出现——布置工作、检查工作外，其他都是平等的。正因为有着这样两种关系，又因为旧社会的影响，领导与群众之间的关系容易模糊人与人之间平等的关系，所以，许多领导者，总是想了各种办法，消除自己和群众之间的隔阂。特别是在整风以后，领导干部深入群众，处处注意以普通劳动者姿态出现。基层干部更是做到了和群众同吃同住同劳动。商县各人民公社干部和群众一起在食堂吃饭，正是反映了这种关系。
    许多干部所以能够经常了解群众意见，群众敢于向干部提出意见，就因为干部能够以普通劳动者姿态出现。相反，有许多干部所以不了解群众的意见，群众也不愿向干部提出自己意见，也就因为干部不以普通劳动者姿态出现。
    在还没有具备普通劳动者的思想作风的时候，在工作中、生活中，处处不能以平等待人。以干部和群众一起吃饭这个问题来说，明明好处很多，领导和群众之间的关系更加密切了。但是有些人迟迟不愿取消干部灶，迟迟不敢到食堂去吃饭。
    干部和群众一起在食堂吃饭，看来是个小事情，但却是个大问题，愿还没有和群众一起在食堂吃饭的人，三思之！
