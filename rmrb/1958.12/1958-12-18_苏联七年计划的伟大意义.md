    The Great Significance of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan
    Wang Sihua
    Not long ago, the Soviet Union announced the control figures for the development of the national economy for 1959-1965. The Soviet Seven-Year Plan is a component of the Soviet Union's fifteen-year long-term plan for building communism's economic program and is an important document of great historical significance.
    The Soviet Seven-Year Plan stipulates that by 1965, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value will increase by 80% compared with 1958, the total agricultural output value will increase by 70%, the national income will increase by 62% to 65%, and steel production will reach 86 million tons to 91 million tons. These inspiring figures clearly demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, marking that the peaceful competition between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp has entered a decisive stage.
    Currently, the Soviet Union has entered a new historical period of transition from socialism to communism due to the victory of socialism. The Seven-Year Plan is the beginning of this great historical period. According to Comrade Khrushchev’s report outline, the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will enable the Soviet Union to surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Europe—Britain and West Germany—in terms of per capita industrial production and rank first in Europe. In another five years, the Soviet Union will practically complete a historical task: catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist country in the world, the United States, in terms of per capita production levels.
    This grand plan shows that the Soviet people are heroically continuing to advance along the glorious path of victory they have taken over the past forty-one years. The majestic posture and great strength shown by the Soviet people in marching towards a communist society not only inspire the socialist brother countries, greatly encourage all peace-loving people in the world, but also deal a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.
    The main task of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is to "further vigorously develop all economic sectors and vigorously strengthen the country's economic potential on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, in order to ensure the continuous improvement of people's living standards."
    The Soviet Union will "develop the national economy at a high speed in the next seven years, while carrying out the necessary balance." This is a very important provision, because the issue of construction speed is one of the most important issues in socialist and communist construction. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in the report outline that "the fundamental issue of the next seven years is the issue of accelerating the development of the national economy along the road of communism, and the issue of winning time to the maximum extent in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism." In order to meet the needs of the people's lives to the greatest extent, production must be developed at the fastest speed. The outline of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan points out that "the starting point of the national economic development prospect plan is: we must win time in the peaceful competition with the most developed capitalist countries and develop the economy at the fastest speed, especially the production sectors that are of decisive significance." The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that in the next seven years, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value will increase by an average of about 8.6% per year, and the average annual increase will be about 130 billion rubles. This is an amazing development speed, and it is a development speed based on a completely reliable foundation.
    The Seven-Year Plan pays special attention to further developing the resources of the eastern regions of the Soviet Union, gradually improving the layout of the Soviet industrial productive forces, and further bringing industry closer to raw material and fuel production areas and consumer areas. On the basis of the newly discovered iron ore in Siberia and Kazakhstan in recent years, the Soviet Union's third metallurgical base with strong strength will be built; in Kazakhstan, Central Asia, the Urals, and areas east of Lake Baikal, non-ferrous metallurgical industry, power industry, petroleum industry, gas industry, chemical industry, and other heavy industries will be vigorously developed. At the same time, all possibilities will be used to accelerate the development of productive forces in the European part of the Soviet Union.
    In the next seven years, the Soviet Union will accelerate the technological progress of all sectors of the national economy, and in particular, the scope of peaceful use of atomic energy will continue to expand. Various sectors of the Soviet national economy will widely adopt new technologies and implement comprehensive mechanization and automation. On the basis of using the latest achievements and discoveries in science and technology, especially on the basis of using radio electronics, superconducting states, ultrasonic waves, radioactive isotopes, semiconductors, nuclear energy, etc., machines will be created and manufactured. Soviet scientists have revealed the mysteries of atomic and thermonuclear reactions and manufactured artificial earth satellites. They will enrich Soviet science with greater discoveries and achievements.
    While further developing agriculture, the socialist relations of production will be improved to bring the two socialist ownership systems closer together. This will be manifested in the further development of the collective farm system, the growth in production funds, the increase and proper use of collective farm public accumulation funds, as well as in jointly organizing industrial enterprises, construction enterprises, and other economic enterprises, and jointly building power stations, roads, irrigation systems and drainage systems, agricultural product processing enterprises, and agricultural product storage enterprises. With the development of collective farm production, when collective farms have become large economies equipped with advanced technology, the material life needs of collective farmers will be met more and more by relying on the public economy, and their personal sideline occupations will gradually lose their significance.
    The Seven-Year Plan strengthens communist education. In order to transition to communism, not only a strong material and technological foundation is needed, but also a high level of awareness among all citizens of socialist society. In order to realize the grand communist construction plan, the Soviet Union requires that all work regarding educating the Soviet people, raising their communist awareness and enthusiasm, and using the spirit of collectivism, love of labor, and social responsibility, using the spirit of socialist internationalism and patriotism, and using the spirit of abiding by the high principles of the morality of the new society to cultivate new people, be resolutely improved. The Seven-Year Plan pays special attention to educating the growing generation in the communist spirit, making schools close to life, combining education with productive labor, mastering the scientific knowledge accumulated by mankind, overcoming the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, and conducting an irreconcilable struggle against the hostile ideological systems of the bourgeoisie.
    The implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will further promote the upsurge of Soviet socialist culture, further increase the spiritual wealth of Soviet society, and further improve the level of communist awareness of the Soviet working people. The plan is to enable all Soviet employees to fully transition to a six- or seven-hour workday and a five-day work week. In this way, the Soviet workday and work week will be the shortest in the world; the Soviet people will have more time to engage in cultural activities and communist education work.
    People can see from the Seven-Year Plan that a series of steps taken by the Soviet Communist Party will lay a solid material and ideological foundation for the transition to communism.
    The control figures of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan irrefutably show that under the socialist system, the high speed of production growth is incomparable to any capitalist country, and the speed of economic development is of decisive significance in peaceful economic competition. For forty-one years, the rapid development of the Soviet national economy has made the situation of the Soviet Union and the United States in the peaceful economic competition even more obvious. For example, since the establishment of the Soviet regime (excluding war years), Soviet industrial production has increased by an average of 16.2% per year, while the United States has only increased by 2.7% in the same period. Comparing 1956 and 1953, Soviet industrial production increased by 41%, while the United States only increased by 7%. After World War II, the United States used its arms expansion and war preparations to militarize its economy, which gave industrial production a false "prosperity," but the growth rate of industrial production in the United States was still far behind the Soviet Union. The following is a comparison table of the growth rate and absolute growth of the Soviet Union and the United States in the output of major industrial products during the period of 1953-1957:
    Average annual growth rate (%)  Average annual absolute growth
    Soviet Union  United States  Soviet Union  United States
    Steel  7.6  0.2  3.2 million tons  0.3 million tons
    Iron  7.8  1.1  2.4 million tons  0.8 million tons
    Coal  9.7  1.4  30.6 million tons  6.2 million tons
    Oil 16.8  2.7  11.4 million tons  8.8 million tons
    It can be seen from the above table that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States not only in terms of growth rate, but also in terms of the annual absolute growth of several important industrial products. This fact completely shattered the fallacy that "the Soviet Union's industrial growth rate can indeed exceed the United States, but the absolute growth will not catch up with the United States." Not only industry, but also the growth rate of Soviet agricultural production has exceeded that of the United States. From 1954 to 1957, the Soviet Union's total agricultural output value increased by an average of 7.1% per year, while the United States only increased by 1.1%. In recent years, the Soviet Union has also far surpassed the United States in many important technologies. The generation of electricity by the world's first atomic power station, the successful manufacture of intercontinental missiles, the launch of three artificial satellites one after another, and the launch of the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker are good proofs. The superiority of the socialist economic system and the advantage of economic development speed are the reliable guarantee for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of industrial production level in the near future.
    The Soviet Union's superiority in production growth rate enables the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita production level in about five years after 1965. By that time, the Soviet Union will be the world's number one in terms of both absolute production and per capita output. This will be a historically significant victory for socialism in peaceful economic competition with capitalism. The international significance of the Seven-Year Plan lies in the fact that the completion of this plan means that the power of the world socialist system will be further strengthened, and the socialist world system will have an absolute advantage over the capitalist system.
    Under the international situation in which the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, the publication of the outline of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan has further strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in the world in the victory of world peace and the cause of human progress. The Chinese people, who are heroically and unyieldingly carrying out socialist construction with a revolutionary spirit and soaring energy, feel boundless joy and encouragement at this huge step of the Soviet Union towards communism and will strive to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and great example. We warmly welcome this grand plan of the Soviet Union and fully believe that the great Soviet people will be able to victoriously complete this great task.

    苏联七年计划的伟大意义
    王思华
    不久以前，苏联公布了1959—1965年发展国民经济的控制数字。苏联这个七年计划是苏联建设共产主义的经济纲领十五年远景计划的组成部分，是具有伟大历史意义的重要文献。
    苏联七年计划规定，到1965年，苏联工业总产值比1958年将增加80％，农业总产值将增加70％，国民收入将增加62％到65％，钢产量将达到八千六百万吨到九千一百万吨。这些振奋人心的数字清楚地说明了社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的无比优越性，标志着社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营之间的和平竞赛已经进入决定性的阶段。
    目前苏联由于社会主义的胜利，已经进入从社会主义向共产主义过渡的新的历史时期。七年计划就是这一伟大历史时期的开端。根据赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲，七年计划执行的结果，将使苏联在按人口平均计算的工业品生产上超过目前欧洲最发达的资本主义国家——英国和西德，而占欧洲第一位，再用五年时间，苏联将实际完成一项历史任务——按人口平均计算的生产水平赶上并超过世界上最发达的资本主义国家美国。
    这一宏伟计划，表明苏联人民正在沿着过去四十一年来所走的辉煌的胜利道路，英勇地继续前进。苏联人民在向共产主义社会迈进中所表现的雄伟姿态和巨大力量，不仅使社会主义兄弟国家人心振奋，使全世界一切爱好和平的人民获得莫大的鼓舞，同时也给帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派以沉重的打击。
    苏联七年计划的主要任务，是“在优先发展重工业的基础上，进一步大力发展各个经济部门，大力加强国家的经济潜力，以保证人民生活水平的不断提高。”
    苏联今后七年要“以高速度发展国民经济，同时进行必要的平衡。”这是一个很重要的规定。因为建设速度问题是社会主义和共产主义建设中的一个最重要的问题。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告提纲中指出，“最近七年的根本问题，是沿着共产主义的道路加速发展国民经济的问题，是在社会主义同资本主义和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间的问题。”为了最大限度地满足人民的生活需要，就必须用最快的速度来发展生产。苏联七年计划提纲中指出，“国民经济发展前景计划的出发点是：必须在同最发达的资本主义国家进行和平竞赛中赢得时间，以最快的速度发展经济，特别是具有决定意义的生产部门。”七年计划规定，在今后七年内，苏联工业总产值每年平均约将增长8.6％，每年平均增长额约为一千三百多亿卢布，这是惊人的发展速度，而又是建立在完全可靠的基础上的发展速度。
    七年计划特别注意进一步开发苏联东部地区的富源，逐渐改善苏联工业生产力的布局，进一步使工业接近原料和燃料产地及消费地区。在近年新发现的西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦的铁矿的基础上，建设力量雄厚的苏联第三冶金基地；在哈萨克斯坦、中亚细亚、乌拉尔、贝加尔湖以东地区，大力发展有色冶金工业、动力工业、石油工业、煤气工业、化学工业等重工业。同时，将利用一切可能来加速发展苏联欧洲部分的生产力。
    今后七年内，苏联将加速国民经济一切部门的技术进步，特别是和平利用原子能的范围将继续扩大。苏联国民经济各部门将广泛地采用新技术、实行全盘机械化和自动化。在利用科学技术最新成就和发现的基础上，特别是在利用无线电电子学、超导状态、超声波、放射性同位素、半导体、核能等等的基础上创造和制造机器。苏联科学家们已经揭示了原子及热核反应的奥秘，制造了人造地球卫星，他们将以更伟大的发现和成就来丰富苏联的科学。
    在进一步发展农业的同时，将要改善社会主义的生产关系，使两种社会主义所有制趋于接近。这将表现在集体农庄制度的进一步发展、生产资金的增长、集体农庄公积金的增加和正当使用，以及表现在共同组织工业企业、建筑企业和其他经济企业，共同建设电站、道路、灌溉系统和排水系统、农产品加工企业和农产品贮藏企业等方面。随着集体农庄生产的发展，当集体农庄已成为以先进技术装备起来的大经济，集体农民的物质生活需要将越来越多地依靠公有经济得到满足，他们的个人副业就将逐渐失去意义。
    七年计划加强了共产主义教育。为了向共产主义过渡，不仅需要强大的物质技术基础，而且需要社会主义社会全体公民高度的觉悟水平。为了实现宏伟的共产主义建设计划，苏联要求把关于教育苏联人民，提高他们的共产主义觉悟和积极性，以及用集体主义、热爱劳动和社会责任感的精神，用社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义的精神、用遵守新社会道德的高度原则的精神来培养新人的全部工作，坚决地加以改进。七年计划特别注意用共产主义精神教育正在成长中的一代，使学校接近生活，使教育同生产劳动相结合，掌握人类所积累的科学知识，克服人们意识中的资本主义残余并对资产阶级的敌对思想体系进行不可调和的斗争。
    七年计划的实现，将使苏联社会主义文化进一步高涨，苏联社会精神财富进一步增长，苏联劳动人民的共产主义觉悟水平进一步提高。计划要使苏联全体职工完全过渡到六、七小时工作日、每周五天工作制。这样一来，苏联的工作日和工作周都将是世界上最短的；苏联人民将有更多的时间从事于文化活动和共产主义教育工作。
    人们从七年计划中可以看到，苏联共产党所采取的一系列的步骤，将为向共产主义过渡奠定坚实的物质和思想的基础。
    苏联七年计划的控制数字无可争辩地表明：在社会主义制度下，生产增长的高速度是一切资本主义国家所无法比拟的，而经济发展的速度在和平经济竞赛中具有决定性的意义。四十一年来，苏联国民经济的迅速发展，使苏联和美国之间在和平经济竞赛中的优胜劣败的形势，更加明显不过了。例如苏维埃政权建立以来（除战争年代外），苏联工业生产平均每年增长16.2％，而美国在同一时期内只增长2.7％。以1956年和1953年相比较，苏联工业生产增加了41％，而美国只增加了7％。第二次世界大战后，美国借着扩军备战，使经济军事化，才使工业生产有过一个虚假的“繁荣”，但是美国工业生产的增长速度还比苏联远远落后。下面是1953—1957年期间苏联和美国在主要工业产品产量的增长速度方面和增长绝对量方面的比较表：
    年平均增长速度（％）  年平均增长绝对量
    苏联  美国  苏联  美国
    钢  7.6  0.2  3.2百万吨  0.3百万吨
    铁  7.8  1.1  2.4百万吨  0.8百万吨
    煤  9.7  1.4  30.6百万吨  6.2百万吨
    石油16.8  2.7  11.4百万吨  8.8百万吨
    从上表可以看出苏联不仅在增长速度方面，而且在几种重要工业产品的每年增长绝对量方面，也已经超过了美国。这一事实完全粉碎了那种所谓“苏联工业增长速度固然可以超过美国，但是增长绝对量则不会赶上美国”的谬论。不仅工业如此，苏联的农业生产增长速度也超过了美国。从1954年到1957年，苏联农业总产量平均每年增长7.1％，而美国仅增长1.1％。近几年来，苏联在许多重要技术方面也远远超过了美国。世界第一个原子电站的发电，洲际导弹的制造成功，前后三颗人造卫星的上天，“列宁号”原子破冰船的下水等等，就是很好的证明。社会主义经济制度的优越性和经济发展速度的优势，是苏联在不久的将来赶上并超过美国工业生产水平的可靠保证。
    苏联在生产增长速度方面的优越性，使苏联在1965年以后大约再用五年时间就能在按人口平均计算的生产水平方面赶上并超过美国。到那时候，苏联不论在生产的绝对量方面，或者在按人口平均计算的产量方面，都将居于世界第一位。这将是社会主义在同资本主义和平经济竞赛方面的具有历史意义的胜利。七年计划的国际意义就在于：完成这个计划意味着世界社会主义体系的威力进一步加强，社会主义世界体系将对资本主义体系占绝对优势。
    在东风继续压倒西风的国际形势下，苏联七年计划提纲的公布，更加强了世界各国人民对于世界和平和人类进步事业的胜利信心。正在以革命的精神、冲天的干劲英勇不挠地进行社会主义建设的中国人民，对苏联走向共产主义的这个巨大步骤，感到无比的欢欣和鼓舞，并将努力学习苏联的先进经验和伟大榜样。我们热烈地欢迎苏联的这个宏伟计划，并且完全相信伟大的苏联人民一定能够胜利地完成这个伟大的任务。
