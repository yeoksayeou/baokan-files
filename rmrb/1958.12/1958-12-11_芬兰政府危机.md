Finnish Government Crisis

The Finnish government crisis continues, with Finnish working people holding rallies and demonstrations demanding the establishment of a government that is supported by workers and small farmers and represents the interests of the people.

On December 4th, the Finnish government headed by Väinö Tanner, the right-wing leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, resigned. The immediate cause of the government's collapse was the resignation of the five ministers from the Finnish Agrarian League who participated in the government, dissatisfied with the government's foreign and domestic policies. The Fagerholm government came to power in August of this year and had been in power for just over three months.

In July of this year, Finland held general elections. In this election, the Finnish People's Democratic League—an alliance of various progressive parties and groups—became the largest party in the Finnish Parliament, holding fifty seats out of two hundred. However, because the People's Democratic League did not receive the support of the Agrarian League and the Social Democratic opposition, it failed to form a government. After more than a month of negotiations, on August 29, President Kekkonen approved the Fagerholm government. At that time, the government included the Agrarian League, the right-wing Donner-Leskinen faction of the Social Democratic Party, the far-right National Coalition Party, the Swedish People's Party, and the Finnish People's Party. Social Democratic opposition member of parliament Voitto Heilala commented on the new government, saying that although there was a left-wing majority in the Finnish parliament, the most reactionary government in nearly thirty years had been formed.

For more than three months, the policies implemented by the Fagerholm government, as Foreign Minister Virolainen (Agrarian League), who has now withdrawn from the government, said, "have failed to satisfactorily address the urgent foreign policy and trade issues facing the country and the nation." Fagerholm, immediately after taking office, declared that trade with the Soviet Union should be reduced, attempting to thereby distort Finland's good-neighborly and friendly foreign policy towards the Soviet Union. In domestic affairs, the Fagerholm government pursued a policy that disregarded the plight of workers and small farmers, merely safeguarding the interests of large paper and wood processing industrial enterprises. Originally, Finnish industrial production had already fallen into crisis. In the first half of this year, the general index of industrial production fell by 80% compared with the same period last year. The paper and pulp industry, which had been rising for several years, also fell by nearly 4%. In addition, Finland's trade situation has also deteriorated recently. In the first nine months, exports decreased by 4% compared with the same period last year, while imports decreased by 16% compared with the same period last year. Goods from socialist countries decreased the most. The Fagerholm government deliberately adopted a passive attitude in improving trade relations with Eastern European countries. This situation will of course make Finland's economic situation even worse and will be met with more dissatisfaction from all sides.

Originally, the Donner-Leskinen faction of the Social Democratic Party, the Swedish People's Party, and the far-right National Coalition Party, which participated in the Fagerholm government, had tried hard to maintain this government, but their activities were unsuccessful. The Fagerholm government finally collapsed. (Xi)

    芬兰政府危机
    芬兰的政府危机在持续中，芬兰劳动人民举行集会示威要求成立一个得到工人和小农支持的、代表人民利益的政府。
    12月4日，以芬兰社会民主党右翼领袖法格霍姆为首的芬兰政府辞职了。这个政府垮台的近因是由于芬兰农民联盟参加政府的五名部长的辞职，他们不满政府的外交和内政政策。法格霍姆政府是今年8月上台的，执政才不过三个多月。
    今年7月间，芬兰举行了大选。在这次大选中，芬兰人民民主联盟——各进步政党和团体的联盟，成为芬兰议会中第一大党，在二百个议席中占有五十席。但是由于人民民主联盟没有得到农民联盟和社会民主党反对派的支持，未能组成政府。经过一个多月的谈判，于8月29日，吉科宁总统批准了法格霍姆政府。当时参加这个政府的有农民联盟、有社会民主党右派——唐纳—勒斯基宁派、有极右翼联合党、瑞典人民党和芬兰人民党。社会民主党反对派议员沃提在评论这个新政府时曾说，虽然芬兰议会中有着左翼多数派，然而却组成了近三十年内最为反动的政府。
    三个多月来，法格霍姆政府执行的政策，正如现已退出政府的外交部长维洛莱宁（农民联盟）所说的，“没有能够令人满意地处理国家和民族方面的迫切的外交政策和贸易问题”。法格霍姆上台伊始就连忙声明，同苏联的贸易应当减少，企图借此篡改芬兰的对苏联睦邻友好的外交方针。而内政方面，法格霍姆政府执行的是不关心工人和小农困境的政策，只是维护造纸和木材加工工业大企业的利益。本来，芬兰工业生产已经陷入危机，今年上半年工业生产总指数较去年同期下降了80％几年来一直上升的纸张、纸浆工业也下降了近4％；另外，芬兰贸易情况近来也已经恶化，头九个月里，出口额比去年同期减少了4％；而入口额比去年同期减少了16％。来自社会主义国家的货物减少得最多。法格霍姆政府在改善同东欧国家贸易关系上故意采取了消极态度。这种情况当然会使得芬兰经济情况更加恶化，遭到各方面更多的不满。
    本来，参加法格霍姆政府的社会民主党唐纳—勒斯基宁派、瑞典人民党和极右翼联合党曾亟力活动想维持住这个政府，但是它们的活动没有成功。法格霍姆政府终于倒了台。                  （西）
