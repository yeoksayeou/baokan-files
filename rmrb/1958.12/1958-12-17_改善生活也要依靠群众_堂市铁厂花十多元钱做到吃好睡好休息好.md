Improving Life Also Requires Relying on the Masses
Tangshi Iron Plant Spends Just Over Ten Yuan to Achieve Good Food, Good Sleep, and Good Rest

(Reported by this newspaper) The Tangshi Iron Plant in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, fully utilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and masses, spending just over ten yuan and using less than ten days to achieve "three goods" (good food, good sleep, and good production).

Not long ago, the Party Committee of Tangshi Iron Plant proposed to improve the management of collective life. In less than ten days, the entire plant implemented a public canteen system: one canteen for each company, with one cook for every sixteen people; cooks were also responsible for making tofu, processing non-staple foods, raising pigs, and growing vegetables. Now, the entire plant has established thirteen canteens, ten tofu and non-staple food processing plants, raised a batch of pigs, and planted dozens of acres of vegetables. Every day's meals include one vegetarian dish and a small meat dish, with a "treat" twice a month; patients also receive special care.

The plant also systematized production and living arrangements, ensuring workers had adequate rest. Regarding housing, the plant uniformly adjusted the residential arrangements for industrial and agricultural households within the plant area, housing them separately and centrally. All housing used wooden planks and bamboo strips to build raised beds, replacing sleeping on the ground. Sanitation work was also strengthened. The plant has a worker-peasant hospital, health stations, and health rooms, equipped with fifteen doctors and trained fifty-eight health workers and twenty-five kitchen sanitation workers. The plant built twenty-six public toilets and fifteen garbage bins, and spittoons were placed in construction sites and workshops. The factory also opened a barber shop. Because the plant's construction site sanitation work was good, the county Party committee issued a red flag award.

In terms of cultural entertainment, the plant built six ball fields, six clubs, and a library, equipped with various recreational supplies. The recreational grounds are lively every day.

Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the workers came up with many good ideas to improve their lives. For example, worker Cai Hongqun, seeing the plant building raised beds, used rice straw and bamboo strips to make a mattress, which was warm and soft when placed on the bed; the masses called it a "native sofa." In order to ensure that everyone had a dedicated cup for drinking tea and gargling, worker Liao Hongyu created a bamboo teacup that was both inexpensive and durable; workers called it the "unbreakable teacup." The entire plant only spent just over ten yuan to equip itself with the necessary equipment and supplies.

Currently, the attendance rate of the entire plant has reached as high as 98.2%, the number of patients has greatly decreased, and dysentery has been eliminated. The number of operators on one furnace has been reduced from the original fifty-six to thirty-six, and work efficiency has increased by 38%. The amount of iron produced is increasing daily; on October 31, seventeen furnaces produced fifteen tons of iron.

    改善生活也要依靠群众
    堂市铁厂花十多元钱做到吃好睡好休息好
    本报讯  湖南省湘潭县堂市铁厂充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，只花十多元钱，用了不到十天的时间，就作到了“三好”（吃好，睡好，生产好）。
    不久以前，堂市铁厂党委会提出要做好集体生活管理工作。不到十天，全厂就实现了公共食堂化：一个连队办一个食堂，十六个人配一个炊事员；炊事员兼搞打豆腐、副食品加工、喂猪、种菜等业务。现在，全厂已经办了十三个食堂，十个豆腐副食品加工厂，养了一批猪，种了几十亩地的菜。每天吃饭做到一素一小荤，半月打一次“牙祭”；病号还有特殊照顾。
    这个厂还做到了生产生活制度化，使工人都有适当的休息。居住方面，在厂区范围内统一调整了工农业住户，分别集中居住。住房全用木板、竹篾搭了高床，代替地铺。卫生工作也加强了。厂里设有工农医院、保健站、保健室，配备了十五个医师，训练了五十八个卫生员，二十五个厨房卫生员。厂里建了二十六处公共厕所，十五个垃圾箱，工地、车间都设有痰盂。工厂还办了理发厅。因为这个厂工地卫生工作好，县委曾发给红旗奖励。
    在文化娱乐方面，这个厂建了六个球场，六个俱乐部，一个图书室，备有各种文娱用品。文娱场地上，每天都很热闹。
    工人为改善生活，在党委领导下想了许多好办法。例如，工人蔡洪群看到厂里在搭高床，便用稻草加篾夹做成垫子，垫在床上又暖又软，群众叫它“土沙发”。为了做到人人有专用的杯子喝茶漱口，工人廖洪玉创造了竹制茶杯，既不花钱，又耐用，工人叫它“打不烂的茶杯”。全厂仅仅用了十多元钱，就把需要的设备、用具备齐了。
    现在，全厂出勤率已经高达98.2％，病人大大减少，并消灭了痢疾。一个炉子上的操作人员由原来的五十六人减少为三十六人，工效提高38％。出铁量逐日上升，10月31日十七座炉出铁达十五吨。
