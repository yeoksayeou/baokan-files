    Is Teacher, Also Nurse
    Jin Wen
    Every mother, when sending their child to kindergarten, considers two things: one is that the child will become smarter and understand many things that cannot be learned at home; the other is that the child, living a collective and regular life, will be healthier and gain weight. These two thoughts are perfectly natural.
    Most childcare workers, upon receiving children from parents, have very warm hearts. In order to better cultivate nearly 100 million communist successors, they are willing to do their best to do a good job. They must not only cultivate "communist successor" virtues in children, but also ensure that the children's bodies grow strong and healthy, so that the children are even better cared for in nurseries and kindergartens than at home.
    Judging from the work of training kindergarten teachers in many places, people have not paid enough attention to, or even noticed, the issue that early childhood educators should have certain health care knowledge. A little investigation reveals that mothers praise a certain nursery or kindergarten as good, and say that a certain nanny or teacher is good, primarily because children who were originally in poor health become "strong and sturdy" after entering the nursery or kindergarten. Only with strong bodies can children achieve other things. Whether nurseries and kindergartens can be consolidated is one of the most important reasons.
    The Sanqi Production Team of the Shatangchuan People's Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, once ran a childcare group, but it disbanded because it was poorly managed. When the childcare center was re-established in March of this year, many people were unwilling to be childcare workers, fearing that it would disband again after a few days. After accepting this task, young woman Wu Daozhang went to find out the reasons why the previous childcare group had failed. She found that the main reason was that the childcare workers did not understand basic hygiene and did not take good care of the children. She grasped this problem, coupled with other efforts, and sure enough, their childcare center was run very well, and mothers said with peace of mind: "I've entrusted my child to you."
    Perhaps some will say: Nurseries and kindergartens are places to take care of children, not children's hospitals. It's impossible to control whether a child is sick or not. If a child gets sick, the parents have to take them back to the hospital for treatment. This is a great difficulty for working parents. Every parent can appreciate this. The best solution is: nurseries and kindergartens should do their best to provide health care, so that children do not get sick or get sick less often. If they unfortunately get sick, nurseries and kindergartens with medical facilities should try their best to treat them. Otherwise, nurseries and kindergartens should help parents send them to the hospital or find a doctor for treatment.
    Perhaps some will also say: Childcare workers have to learn politics and early childhood education skills. If they also have to learn health knowledge, isn't that too complicated? This complexity is necessary. If we avoid the trouble of learning health knowledge, it will cause more trouble. If the children are not well cared for and get sick, wouldn't that bring a lot of trouble!
    It may seem like a small matter for childcare workers to understand health knowledge, but it is actually a major issue related to today and tomorrow. Precisely because of this, one of the challenges that childcare work representatives attending the Second National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism for Youth put forward to childcare workers across the country is to cultivate themselves to "be a good nurse."

    是教师，又是护士 
    金文
    每一个妈妈把自己孩子送到幼儿园去的时候，心里都会考虑到两个问题：一个是小孩会更聪明了，懂得许多家庭里学不到的事；另一个是小孩过着集体的有规律的生活，身体更好了，长胖了。这两个想法，正是人之常情。
    多数的保育工作者们从家长手里接过孩子以后，她们的心是非常热的，为了更好地培养近一亿的共产主义接班人，她们愿意尽一切力量去做好工作。既要培养儿童具有“共产主义接班人”的品德，又要让孩子们的身体也长的胖胖的，要使孩子在托儿所、幼儿园比在家长得更好。
    从许多地方培养幼儿园教育师资的工作看来，人们对于幼儿教育工作者应该具有一定的卫生保健知识这一问题，还注意不够，甚至还没有注意。稍一考察就可以了解到，母亲们称赞某某托儿所、幼儿园好，说某某阿姨、老师好，首先一条是原来身体挺不好的孩子，进了托儿所、幼儿园以后变成“结结实实”的了。孩子们有了结实的身体，才能谈到其他。托儿所、幼儿园能不能巩固，这是最重要的原因之一。
    青海省互助土族自治县沙塘川人民公社三其生产队曾经办过托儿组，因为办得不好，散伙了。今年3月间再办托儿所时，很多人不愿意当保育员，怕办不了几天又得散伙。青年妇女吴道章接受了这个任务以后，她去找以前托儿组办不好的原因，发现主要是因为保育员不懂卫生常识，对孩子照管不够。她抓住了这一问题，再加上其他方面的努力，果然她们的托儿所办得很好，母亲们放心地说：“我的孩子交给你了。”
    也许有人会说：托儿所、幼儿园是收托孩子的地方，不是儿童医院，孩子患病与否，是管不了的，孩子病了只好请家长接回去带到医院去诊治。这对有工作的父母来说，是很大的困难。每个做父母的人都能体会到这点。最好的办法是：托儿所、幼儿园尽可能做好卫生保健工作，使孩子不生病或少生病，不幸生了病，在有医疗条件的托儿所和幼儿园里，尽可能由托儿所、幼儿园设法治疗，否则，也应尽可能由托儿所和幼儿园帮助家长送医院或找医生治疗。
    也许有人还会说：保育工作者要学政治、学幼儿教育业务，如果还要学卫生知识，不是太复杂了？这种复杂是必要的，如果为了免去学卫生知识的麻烦，将会造成更多的麻烦。护理不好，孩子病了，不就带来许多麻烦么！
    保育工作者要懂得卫生知识，看起来是一件小事，其实是关系今天和明天的一件大事，正是因为这样，出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会保育工作代表们向全国保育工作者提出的挑战书中有一条，要培养自己“会当个好护士”。
