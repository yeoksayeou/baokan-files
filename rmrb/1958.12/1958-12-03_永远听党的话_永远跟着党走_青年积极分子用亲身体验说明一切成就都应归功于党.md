Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Today is the last day of the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists. The young activists who spoke at the meeting today all used their personal experiences to illustrate that all achievements should be attributed to the Party and Chairman Mao. They also expressed the common desire of all young activists: to always listen to the Party and always follow the Party in the future.

Xu Chenglong, a Qingdao woodworking worker who transformed from an ordinary carpenter into someone capable of reading blueprints, designing, and manufacturing tools, pointed out in his speech today that the Party's constant encouragement and support were the main reasons why he could achieve results and gain honors in his work. The title of his speech was: "The Party Gave Me the Power to Innovate Technology."

Xu Chenglong had planned to trial-produce a wood board jointing machine several years ago, but failed after more than a dozen attempts. When he heard some people's sarcastic remarks, he was somewhat discouraged. The Party branch secretary encouraged him, saying, "Failure should be seen as the mother of success; if ten times doesn't work, then a hundred times, if a hundred times doesn't work, then a thousand times, as long as you are determined, you will succeed sooner or later." The Party organization also brought in blacksmiths and engineers to help him solve some technical difficulties. In this way, he finally trial-produced the wood board jointing machine, which improved efficiency by two and a half times compared to the original manual operation.

Later, Xu Chenglong planned to automate the jointing machine. After a year and a half of painstaking experimentation, he drew up the blueprints for the automated jointing machine and was just waiting to find waste materials to manufacture it, but he was blocked by the head of the production technology section. At this time, he went to the Party secretary of the general factory again. The Party secretary told him that all factories under the general factory could be approached for raw materials and personally accompanied him to find them. In this way, he trial-produced an automatic jointing machine, which improved efficiency by fifteen to twenty times compared to manual labor.

Once, the factory planned to spend sixty to seventy thousand yuan to build a modern oven. Xu Chenglong, thinking of saving funds for the country, suggested converting the toilet into an oven. This suggestion was again opposed by some people. At this time, he went to the Party secretary again, and the Party immediately adopted his suggestion. In the end, it only cost more than one hundred yuan to build an oven from the toilet.

Thinking of the Party when encountering difficulties, any creation can be achieved with the support of the Party. This is the deepest impression that Xu Chenglong's speech today gave people. Precisely because he did this, this ordinary carpenter created and improved a total of sixty-five kinds of tools and equipment during the first five-year plan period, and created and improved twenty-nine kinds of tools in the first half of this year, which is estimated to save the country more than two million yuan in funds.

The success of He Binggeng, a representative of the Zhouchang Youth Agricultural Technology Research Institute in Huichang County, Jiangxi Province, in experimenting with "distant hybridization of sorghum and rice" also has the same process. When they started this experiment, conservatives said they were "daydreaming" and "messing around." Some people in the experimental group also lacked confidence. But the Party branch secretary encouraged them, saying, "You are doing the right thing, you should have the courage and confidence to persevere to the end. If there are any difficulties, the Party will definitely support you." The Party's instructions made them clear about the purpose and significance of the experiment, and everyone felt a great responsibility. Whenever they encountered difficulties and setbacks in the experiment, the Party branch instructed them to write letters to other places to learn from experience, sent people to the city to borrow thermometers and magnifying glasses, and the township government borrowed clocks to calculate the time. The Party branch secretary also personally guided the experiment. After eleven experiments, they finally cultivated the first generation of hybrid rice and sorghum seeds.

The successful experience of Xia Deji, a research intern at the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and three other comrades in jointly researching electric plows vividly illustrates the great effect of the Party's leadership in agricultural science. When Xia Deji reported on their research process, he said that he received strong support from the Party organization when he first proposed researching electric plows, and it was listed as an important research topic. Three comrades were also specially transferred to work with him. The Party also taught them to develop a communist style of daring to think and act, to take the road of agricultural mechanization and electrification in China, and to take the road of indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. During the research process, they went to production and among the masses to find teachers according to the Party's instructions. In order to develop the finished product as soon as possible, under the guidance of the Party, they broke through the old rules in research methods and adopted a research method that combined researchers and workers, research, trial production, and improvement. Whenever their experiments failed, the Party organization always encouraged them, saying: Don't be afraid of failure, continue to experiment. Because the Party organization continued to encourage them in this way, they never lost heart. After more than three months of intensive hard work and more than ten experimental improvements, they finally achieved preliminary research success in mid-June, nine months ahead of schedule. The electric plow has been tested and works very well. It can now plow two feet deep and six inches wide, and can plow about one mu of land per hour.

"Nothing can be accomplished without the Party." Gao Jie, a young actress from the Henan Provincial Yuju Opera Troupe, used a tortuous experience of her own to vividly illustrate this point in her speech.

Gao Jie said that she originally performed operas and dramas in an art troupe. In 1952, she was transferred to the Yuju Opera Troupe to learn Yuju Opera. Under the Party's education and with the help of veteran artists, she overcame the erroneous ideas of despising artists and national heritage, and learned and improved her performing skills. Later, she also went abroad to visit and perform, and received respect and encouragement from all sides. It was at this time that her thinking began to change. In the past, she always felt emotionally that she could not leave the Party for a moment, and leaving the Party was like leaving her mother. At that time, she really listened to the Party, and she did whatever the Party told her to do. After returning to China in 1957, she gradually felt that she had the ability and prestige, and even thought that she was the main character in the troupe, and the troupe could not do without her, and the Party could not do without her. So she hoped that the Party would be more special to her. When her desires were not met, she gradually became estranged from the Party emotionally. At the same time, she was not modest to her comrades, and gradually became luxurious in her life, and she did not talk about diligent study and hard practice. Therefore, this period became a stage in which her business stagnated. After the rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, she accepted the Party's education, and finally gradually realized that as a people's actor, if she did not listen to the Party, she would first have no firm political stance, and if she was only specialized but not red, she would not make much contribution to the people, and it would be impossible to have much achievement in the art career. After she rejoined the Party, under the leadership of the Party, she was more energetic and her creativity was greatly developed.

After narrating this experience of hers, Gao Jie said: "If I have made a little bit of achievement on the road of learning, it is due to the Party's education and training, the help of veteran artists, and the cooperation of comrades. I will accomplish nothing without the Party.

Three young activists from ethnic minorities also spoke today. They are: Gari Sengbater, a League branch secretary from Alukeerqin Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; Wei Yingchang, a Ka Wa youth from Ximeng County, Yunnan Province; and Mamatisi Kesike, League general branch secretary from Rasque Township, Hotan County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. They also talked in their speeches that by listening to the Party and resolutely obeying the Party's leadership, young people of ethnic minorities have made contributions to the construction of the border areas.

One hundred and twenty-eight young forestry activists from twenty-five provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions and state organs attending the meeting read out a proposal on accelerating the greening and beautifying of the motherland, represented by Wang Zhiying, at today's meeting. The proposal put forward five suggestions to young people across the country: 1. Carry out large-scale afforestation movements on a larger scale; 2. Widely carry out movements to create fast-growing and high-yielding forests; 3. March into the desert and turn the vast desert into an oasis; 4. Continue to vigorously carry out seed collection and seedling cultivation activities; 5. Strive to complete and exceed the timber production task ahead of schedule.

Two young forestry activists - Su Shiqing from Yanbei area in Shanxi Province and Cai Liuhua from Xianfeng People's Commune in Longxi County, Fujian Province, spoke at the meeting one after another. Su Shiqing reported on the great achievements made by 380,000 young people in Yanbei area in afforestation under the leadership of the Party in order to change the natural appearance of Yanbei in recent years. Cai Liuhua introduced the victorious deeds of the youth of their entire commune in organizing a 540-person mountain-opening expedition commando team to develop the uninhabited Mao Mountain and create a 10,000-mu orchard.

A total of nineteen people spoke at the meeting today. Among them were Zhao Dianhua, League Committee Secretary of Guodao Township, Yuanqin County, Shanxi Province, Zhang Fengtong, Deputy Secretary of the Dalian Municipal League Committee, Yu Keshu, Deputy Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal League Committee, Xu Wencai, police officer of the Jiangning District Public Security Bureau in Shanghai, Li Jiusu, cook of the canteen of Huangsi People's Commune in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, Zhang Hougen, representative of the League General Branch of the Changsha Meat Joint Processing Factory in Hunan, Hong Fujun, League Committee Secretary of Xuwen County, Guangdong Province (joint speech), Ma Chengliang, League Branch Secretary of Huaiyuan County Youth Bearing Factory in Anhui Province, and Wang Shuren, street timber worker in Changchun City, Jilin Province.

From November 25th to December 2nd, a total of one hundred and thirty-two people spoke at the meeting in eight days. In addition, the meeting also distributed written speeches from one hundred and fifty-three young activists.

### 永远听党的话  永远跟着党走  青年积极分子用亲身体验说明一切成就都应归功于党

    永远听党的话  永远跟着党走
    青年积极分子用亲身体验说明一切成就都应归功于党
    新华社2日讯  今天是全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的最后一天。在今天大会上发言的青年积极分子，都以亲身的体验说明，一切成就都应该归功于党，归功于毛主席。他们并且表达了全体青年积极分子的共同心愿：今后要永远听党的话，永远跟着党走。
    从一个普通木匠变成能看图、设计和制造工具的青岛木器工人徐呈龙，今天在发言中指出，党的不断鼓励和支持，是他能在工作中做出成绩和得到荣誉的最主要的原因。他的发言题目是：“党给了我革新技术的力量”。
    徐呈龙几年前曾打算试制一种木板对缝机，但试验十几次都失败了，他听到一些人的冷言冷语时曾经有些灰心，党总支书记便鼓励他说：“应该把失败看作成功之母；十次不行，百次，百次不行，千次，只要下决心，早晚会成功。”党组织还找来了铁匠和工程师，帮助他解决一些技术上的困难。这样，他终于把木板对缝机试制出来，比原来的手工操作提高效率二倍半。
    以后，徐呈龙又计划要使对缝机自动化，经过一年半时间的苦心试验，他画好了自动化对缝机图纸，就等着找废料来制造，但又碰到生产技术科长的阻挠，这时他便又去找总厂党委书记，党委书记告诉他，总厂所属的厂子都可以去找原料，并且亲自陪着他去找。这样他又试制成了自动对缝机，效率比手工又提高了十五倍到二十倍。
    有一次，厂里曾计划用六七万元建设个现代化烤炉，徐呈龙想着要给国家节约资金，便建议把厕所改建为烤炉，这个建议又遭到一些人的反对，这时他又去找党委书记，党立即采纳了他的意见，最后只花了一百多元，用厕所建成了烤炉。
    遇到困难就想起了党，只要有党的支持，什么样的创造都能办到。这就是徐呈龙今天的发言给予人们的最深的印象。正因为他做到了这一点，所以，他这个普通的木工，在第一个五年计划期间一共创造、改进了六十五种工具设备，今年上半年又创造、改进了二十九种工具，估计共可为国家节约资金二百多万元。
    江西省会昌县州场青年农业技术研究所代表何炳庚试验“高粱和水稻远缘杂交”成功这件事，也有着同样的过程。当他们开始进行这项试验时，保守派就说他们是“白天说梦话”，是“瞎闹”，试验小组里有的人也缺乏信心。但是党总支书记鼓励他们说：“你们做得对，应该拿出勇气和信心坚持到底，如果有困难，党一定支持你们。”党的指示使他们明确了搞试验的目的和意义，大家都感到责任很大。当他们在试验中每遇到困难和挫折的时候，党总支就指示他们写信到外地学习经验，派人到城里借来了温度计和放大镜，乡政府又借钟给他们计算时间，党支部书记还亲自指导试验。经过十一次试验，他们终于培育出第一代水稻和高粱杂交的种子。
    中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所研究实习员夏德济和其他三位同志共同研究电犁的成功经过，生动地说明了党的领导在农业科学中的巨大效果。夏德济报告他们的研究的过程时说，他一开始提出研究电犁，就得到了党组织的大力支持，把它列为一项重要的研究课题。还专门抽调了三位同志和他一起研究。党并且教导他们，要发挥敢想敢干的共产主义风格，要走中国农业的机械化电气化的道路，走土法上马、土洋结合的道路。在研究过程中，他们又根据党的指示，到生产中和群众中去寻找老师。为了尽快地研究出成品来，他们在党的指点下，冲破了研究方法上的陈规，采用了研究人员和工人相结合，边研究、边试制、边改进的研究方法。每当他们试验失败时，党组织总是鼓励他们说：不要怕失败，要继续试验。由于党组织这样不断鼓励，他们一直没有灰心，经过三个多月的突击苦战，十多次的试验改进，终于在6月中旬提前九个月初步研究成功。这种电犁经过试验效果很好，现在已能耕深二尺，耕宽六寸，每小时能耕地一亩左右。
    “离开了党就将一事无成”。河南省豫剧院青年演员高洁在发言中，用她自己一段曲折的经历生动地说明了这一点。
    高洁说，她原来是在文工团演歌剧、话剧的，1952年调到豫剧院学豫剧，她在党的教育下和老艺人的帮助下，克服了轻视艺人和民族遗产的错误思想，学会和提高了表演技术。以后她又曾出国访问演出。受到各方面的尊重和鼓励。就在这时，她的思想开始发生了变化。过去，她从感情上总觉得一刻也离不开党，离开党就像离开了妈妈，那时，她真听党的话，党叫她怎样做她就怎样做。1957年回国以后，她逐渐觉得自己有本事、有声望了，甚至认为自己在剧团里已是主要角色，剧团离不了她，党也离不了她。于是她就希望党对她要特殊些。当她的欲望得不到满足时，她在感情上就和党慢慢疏远起来。同时，对同志们也不虚心了，在生活上也逐渐讲究奢华起来，也谈不到勤学苦练。因此，这一段就成了她业务停滞不前的阶段。经过整风和反右派斗争，她接受了党的教育，最后终于逐渐觉悟过来，认识到作为一个人民演员，如果不听党的话，首先在政治上没有坚定的立场，只专不红，就不会给人民作出多大贡献，在艺术事业上也不可能有多大造就。当她重新向党靠拢之后，在党的领导下，干劲更足了，创造性也大大发扬了。
    高洁在叙述了她这一段经历以后说：“如果说我在学习的道路上有一点点成绩的话，那是由于党的教育培养，前辈艺人的帮助和同志们的合作。离开了党我将一事无成。
    今天发言的还有三位少数民族青年积极分子。他们是：内蒙古自治区阿鲁科尔沁旗的一位团支部书记嘎日僧巴特尔，云南省西盟县佧佤族青年魏应昌，新疆维吾尔自治区和阗县拉斯奎乡团总支书记买买提斯的克。他们在发言中也都谈到，由于听了党的话，坚决服从党的领导，少数民族青年在边疆建设中作出了贡献。
    出席大会的二十五个省、市、自治区和国家机关的一百二十八名青年林业积极分子，在今天大会上由他们的代表王志英宣读了关于加速绿化祖国、美化祖国的倡议书。倡议书向全国青少年提出五项建议：一、更大规模地开展大面积造林运动；二、广泛开展营造快速丰产林运动；三、向沙漠大进军，使万里黄沙变绿洲；四、继续大力开展采种育苗活动；五、力争提前和超额完成木材生产任务。
    两位林业青年积极分子——山西省雁北地区的苏士清和福建省龙溪县先锋人民公社的蔡流花，在会上先后发言。苏士清报告了雁北地区三十八万青年在党的领导下，几年来为了改变雁北的自然面貌，在植树造林方面作出的巨大成绩。蔡流花介绍了他们全社青年组织一支五百四十人的开山远征突击队开发荒无人烟的大帽山，营造万亩果林的胜利事迹。
    今天在大会上发言的一共十九人。他们之中还有山西省原沁源县郭道乡团委书记赵殿华，共青团旅大市委副书记张凤桐，共青团重庆市委副书记于克书，上海江宁区公安分局民警徐文彩，河北省邢台县皇寺人民公社食堂炊事员李九苏，湖南长沙肉类联合加工厂团总支代表张厚根，共青团广东省徐闻县委书记洪福均（联合发言），安徽省怀远县青年轴承厂团支部书记马承良，吉林省长春市街道木材工人王淑仁。
    从11月25日到12月2日的八天中，在大会上发言的一共有一百三十二人，另外，大会还分发了一百五十三个青年积极分子的书面发言。
