Xinhua News Agency, Luxembourg, December 27th - According to a TASS report from Luxembourg, the 15th National Congress of the Luxembourg Communist Party concluded on the 26th.

    The Congress unanimously adopted resolutions on the Party's tasks in the current situation (based on the report by General Secretary Urbany) and on the Party's attitude towards the current government crisis in Luxembourg. The Congress also elected the Party's Central Committee, Finance Committee, and Supervisory Committee. The Congress unanimously elected Dominique Urbany as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Luxembourg Communist Party.

    At the meeting on the 26th, delegates from party organizations at all levels who attended the Congress expressed their agreement with the report "The Party's Tasks in the Current Situation" made by Party General Secretary Urbany and the report on "The Activities of the Communist Parliamentary Group" by Party Central Committee Secretary Usaldinger, and called on the delegates to take active steps to realize the tasks facing the Party.

    Dichbourg, a delegate from Luxembourg City, pointed out that the purpose of establishing various "European" organizations such as the "Common Market" is primarily to intensify the exploitation of working people. He said that the "Common Market" is freedom for capitalists and enslavement for working people, which strengthens the competition of the strong and destroys the national economy of weaker countries like Luxembourg. Dichbourg called for constantly exposing the domestic ruling class's policies that disregard the real interests of the Luxembourg people.

    Friesch, a member of the Central Committee of the Luxembourg Communist Party, spoke about the Communist Party's election program. He pointed out that this program is a program for striving for Luxembourg's national independence, opposing the militarization of the country, and opposing making Luxembourg subordinate to the interests of the American imperialists. Friesch said that we should remind our people to pay attention to the threat of West German militarism, which is fostered and protected by Western countries, to Luxembourg.

    Grandhenry, a member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee and a trade union leader, emphasized in his speech that the majority of members of the workers' committees in many domestic industrial enterprises are Communists, and they have won the complete trust of the working masses.

    Yesterday's Congress also heard and discussed the report on "Communist Newspapers" made by Kill, a member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee.

    卢共十五次代表大会闭幕
    通过当前任务决议选出新领导机构
    新华社27日讯  据塔斯社卢森堡消息，卢森堡共产党第十五次代表大会已经在26日闭幕。
    代表大会一致通过了关于在当前形势下党的任务（根据总书记欧班尼的报告）以及关于党在卢森堡当前政府危机问题上的态度的决议。大会还选出了党的中央委员会、财政和监察委员会。大会一致选举欧班尼为卢森堡共产党中央委员会总书记。
    在26日的会议上，各级党组织出席大会的代表在发言中都表示同意党的总书记欧班尼所做的“在当前形势下党的任务”的报告以及党中央委员会书记乌撒尔丁格关于“共产党议会党团的活动”的报告，并且号召代表们积极行动来实现党所面临的任务。
    卢森堡市的代表迪希布格指出，建立各种各样像“共同市场”之类的“欧洲”组织，其目的首先是为了加紧剥削劳动人民。他说，“共同市场”是给资本家的自由，是对劳动人民的奴役，这使强者的竞争加强，而使卢森堡之类较弱的国家的民族经济遭到破坏。迪希布格号召不断地揭露国内统治阶级不顾卢森堡人民真正利益的政策。
    卢森堡共产党中央委员会委员弗里希在发言中谈到共产党的竞选纲领。他指出，这个纲领是争取卢森堡民族独立、反对国家军国主义化、反对使卢森堡服从于美帝国主义者利益的纲领。弗里希说，我们应该提醒我国人民，注意为西方国家所豢养和庇护的西德军国主义对卢森堡的威胁。
    党中央政治局委员、工会领袖格兰登内特在发言中强调指出，国内许多工业企业的工人委员会中的大多数委员都是共产党员，他们获得工人群众的完全信任。
    昨天的代表大会还听取和讨论了党中央委员会政治局委员基尔作的“关于共产党报刊”的报告。
