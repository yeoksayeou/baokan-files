    Shoe Giving
    ——Selected Poems by Downward-Sent Cadres
  Going to the fields is like going to the battlefield,
  Going to the fields is like going to the battlefield,
  The iron shovel is the gun in hand,
  This year the land is turned over,
  Next year the grain will be piled high in the barn. (Dao Liangzuo)
    Farewell to the elders of Xuchang
  More than ten months of being sent down for training,
  Red and expert seeds planted in the heart,
  Sharing joys and sorrows easily passes the seasons,
  Mountains, rivers, grass and trees are all moved.
  The elders' entrustment is remembered in the heart,
  Accelerating on the leap forward road,
  Come again in the future to celebrate the harvest,
  City and countryside will be indistinguishable.
  (Tao Zhixin, Shi Shaoyue)
    Giving Shoes
  We came to settle down without knowing each other,
  Warm care like family,
  Treating each other like this for ten months,
  Caring about warmth and food.
  Thousands of stitches sewn tightly,
  Giving shoes before parting, wishing a bright future,
  Repaying auntie's kindness,
  Be red and expert for the people. (Shan Mingduan)

    赠鞋
    ——下放干部诗选
  下地好比上战场下地好比上战场，铁锨就是手中枪，今年土地大翻身，明年粮食堆满仓。（道良佐）
    别许昌父老下放锻炼十月整，红专种子植心灵，同甘共苦易寒暑，山川草木皆动情。父兄嘱托记在心，跃进道上更兼程，他年再来庆丰收，城市农村辨不清。
  （陶志新、师绍约）
    赠鞋素不相识来落户，热情关怀赛亲人，十月相待如一日，饥寒饱暖全操心。千针万线密密缝，临别赠鞋祝前程，报答大娘一片心，红透专深为人民。（单明端）
