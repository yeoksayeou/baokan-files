Xinhua News Agency, London, December 14th: Today's London "Observer" newspaper, commenting on the upcoming North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting, quoted officials within the group as saying that under the "domination of the current crisis," the meeting "has little hope of eliminating the centrifugal forces that are tearing NATO apart."

The Sunday newspaper then spoke caustically and exaggeratedly about France's attitude, saying that France, as the host country of the meeting, seemed to be the "problem child" of the group, refusing to follow the path dominated by the United States and Britain.

The newspaper believes that, judging from the preparations for this meeting, France refuses to cooperate with the institutions of the alliance militarily, politically, and economically unless its demands are met. Its demands are: to be allowed to participate in planning global strategy, and at the same time to be given atomic weapons and "technical knowledge" in accordance with its status as a major power.

The newspaper said that France's demands, especially its desire to establish a Western tripartite control of NATO together with Britain and the United States, have been coldly treated in Washington, London, and Bonn. Therefore, France is unwilling to undertake obligations in the US plan to establish nuclear defense (including policies on intermediate-range ballistic missiles). Unless the United States hands over atomic warheads, France will not agree to transport missiles into France or establish launch bases in France. France opposes the collective assumption of the cost of setting up new weapons by NATO. France also opposes placing its air force fighter units under the unified command of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

The newspaper believes that France feels resentful for failing to obtain a special nuclear and political status in NATO, which is the main reason why France is unwilling to compromise in the dispute over the Common Market issue.

    英报评北大西洋集团巴黎会议
    认为离心力量难以消除
    新华社伦敦14日电  今天的伦敦“观察家报”在评论即将举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议时援引这个集团里官员们的看法说：在“当前危机支配下”，这次会议“很少有希望能消除使得北大西洋公约组织各国分崩离析下的离心力量”。
    这家星期日报纸接着用夸张的口吻尖刻地谈到法国的态度说，作为这次会议东道国的法国，似乎是这个集团中的“问题儿童”；它拒绝遵循在美国和英国支配下的路线。
    这家报纸认为，从这次会议的准备工作看来，法国拒绝在军事上、政治上和经济上同公约组织的机构进行合作，除非它的要求得到满足。它的要求是：准许法国参与计划全球战略，同时按照它的大国地位而给予它原子武器和“技术知识”。
    这家报纸说，法国的这些要求，尤其是它要同英美一道来建立西方三国对北大西洋集团的控制的要求，一直在华盛顿、伦敦和波恩受到冷淡对待。因此，法国不愿意在美国建立核防务的计划（包括关于中程弹道导弹的政策）里承担义务。除非美国交给它原子弹头，法国不答应把导弹运进法国和在法国建立发射基地。法国反对把设置新武器的费用由北大西洋集团集体负担。法国还反对把它的空军战斗机部队交由欧洲盟军最高司令部统一指挥。
    报纸认为，法国因为没能在北大西洋集团里取得特殊的核地位和政治地位而感到愤愤不平，这就是法国为什么在有关共同市场问题的争执中不肯妥协的主要原因之一。
