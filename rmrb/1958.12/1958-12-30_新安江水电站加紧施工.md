Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 29th. The workers constructing the Xin'an River Hydropower Station are speeding up construction with new technical measures, striving to generate electricity ahead of schedule by the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China next year.

　　The construction site is now a scene of intense activity. The roar of construction machinery drowns out the sound of the river. Whether working on the main project site or in auxiliary enterprises, the tens of thousands of workers have shouted the same slogan: "Contribute to raising the dam!" As the dam continues to rise, the task of mechanical pouring becomes increasingly heavy. The workers installing the giant gantry cranes have displayed soaring enthusiasm. In mid-November, they completed the installation of a ten-ton gantry crane in only sixty-eight hours.

　　The Xin'an River Hydropower Station is one of China's large-scale hydropower stations, located on the Xin'an River, a tributary of the Zhejiang River (Qiantang River), the largest river in Zhejiang Province. The Xin'an River is 260 kilometers long, with many high mountains and canyons on both sides and abundant rainfall. The Xin'an River Hydropower Station makes full use of these advantageous terrain and water conditions. The original design of the power station had an installed capacity of 580,000 kilowatts, with power generation starting in 1961. In order to generate electricity as soon as possible, all the workers building the power station decided to advance the power generation date to "October 1st" next year. Moreover, the installed capacity has been increased by more than 70,000 kilowatts compared to the original design, and the construction cost will also be reduced by 40%.

　　After the Xin'an River Hydropower Station is completed, it will transmit electricity to industrial cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Wuxi through ultra-high-voltage transmission lines, and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production in the Jiangnan area of China.

　　This hydropower station was designed and constructed by our own technicians with the assistance of Soviet experts, and the power generation equipment was also manufactured by ourselves.

### 新安江水电站加紧施工

    新安江水电站加紧施工
    新华社杭州29日电  建设新安江水力发电站的职工，为了争取这座电站在明年建国十周年时提前发电，正在根据新的技术措施加紧施工。
    现在工地上是一片紧张繁忙景象。施工机械的响声盖过了江水的呼啸，上万个职工不论在主体工程工地或辅助企业里工作，喊出了一个相同的口号：“为大坝升高立功”！随着大坝的不断升高，机械浇捣的任务日益繁重，安装巨大的门式起重机的职工发挥了冲天干劲，在11月中旬，只花六十八个小时就完成了一台十吨的门式起重机的安装任务。
    新安江水电站是我国大型水电站之一，位于浙江省最大河流浙江（钱塘江）上游支流新安江上。新安江全长二百六十公里，两岸多高山峡谷，雨量充沛。新安江水电站充分地利用了这些有利的地势和水利条件，原设计电站装机容量五十八万瓩，1961年开始发电。建设电站的全体职工为了让它早日发出电力，决定提前到明年“十、一”发电，而且把装机容量比原设计增多了七万多瓩，建设费用也将节约40％。
    新安江电站建成后，将经过超高压输电线路把电力输送到上海、杭州、南京、无锡等工业城市，并促进我国江南一带的工农业生产的发展。
    这座水电站是我国技术人员在苏联专家帮助下自己设计自己施工的，发电设备也是自己制造的。
