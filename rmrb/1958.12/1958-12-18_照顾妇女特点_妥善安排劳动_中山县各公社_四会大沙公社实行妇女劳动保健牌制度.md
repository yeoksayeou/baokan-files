Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: People's communes in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, are universally paying attention to the labor protection of women members.

\tProduction teams are promoting a system called "Women's Labor Health Card." The card has columns for registering the names of women who are menstruating, pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum. Every morning before going to work, the production team leader or Party branch secretary assigns work suitable for their physiological characteristics based on the different situations recorded on the Women's Labor Health Card. For example, women who are menstruating are assigned to dry work and not wet work; women in early pregnancy are assigned to light work and not heavy work; women in late pregnancy are assigned to work that allows them to stand upright and not bend over; breastfeeding women are assigned to work nearby for convenient breastfeeding; women are given leave after childbirth, and their wages are paid as usual.

\tIn addition to these considerations in labor allocation, each commune also established one or more maternity hospitals in each production area to ensure that all mothers can be hospitalized and receive regular prenatal check-ups. Communes also provide nutritional subsidies to mothers according to their own conditions, some by issuing money for mothers to manage themselves, and others by having the maternity hospital buy nutritional products for mothers to eat. In addition, all female commune members in the county have three days of vacation each month, one day more than male members. Four thousand one hundred and sixteen kindergartens and nurseries have also been established throughout the county, enabling more than 90% of children to be enrolled.

\tWhen the county began to implement the "Women's Labor Health Card" system, many women, especially young women, were embarrassed to record their menstruation, pregnancy, and other matters on the card. Individual cadres worried that it might reduce labor attendance. In response to this situation, the Zhongshan County Party Committee successively convened meetings of women cadres and commune welfare directors throughout the county to carry out in-depth ideological mobilization, dispel female members' concerns, and make male members aware of the necessity of taking care of women's physiological characteristics. Communes also held on-site meetings to conduct inspections and comparisons. As a result, this system was quickly established throughout the county.

\tAfter the implementation of the "Women's Labor Health Card" system, the health of the majority of rural women has been effectively protected, and the development of production has been promoted. After many production areas and communes implemented this system, there have been no cases of miscarriage, and fewer women are getting sick. Their production enthusiasm has been further increased, and labor efficiency has been further improved. Many women have said that they must work more actively to repay the Party for their care.

This newspaper reports: On the morning of December 4, on the women's labor protection registration card of the Fifth Company of Dasha Commune in Sihui County, Guangdong Province, six small bamboo cards with names written on them were hung in the menstruation period column, and six women were also hanging cards in the pregnancy period column, and there were more in the breastfeeding period, with twenty-six. Shao Xiaoping, the company instructor and director of women's affairs, assigned farm work suitable for their physiological characteristics to the female members based on the registration card.

\tOn this day, on the drying ground of the Fifth Company, twelve female members in their menstrual periods, pregnant, and two who had just passed their confinement period were doing light work such as drying grain, winnowing grain, and drying rice straw; those who were breastfeeding were carrying rice stalks back and forth, making it convenient to breastfeed their children. The day before, when eating lunch in the canteen, company instructor Shao Xiaoping originally wanted to send Huang Jinhao to pump water to irrigate the land, but Huang Jinhao said, "There's a 'special situation' today!" Shao Xiaoping knew that she was menstruating and changed her to drying grain. Huang Jinhao's husband smiled and said, "The cadres really take good care of the women!" In addition, even during day and night hard work, pregnant women and breastfeeding women are never assigned night work and do not participate in military exercises. In addition to implementing labor protection for female members, after the establishment of this commune, nurseries and kindergartens have been established, and all children under the age of three in the commune have entered the nurseries. All children from the ages of three to seven have also entered kindergartens. The commune has also established a maternity hospital, and women go to the maternity hospital to have their babies and pregnant women go to the maternity hospital for regular check-ups; the commune gives mothers forty days of leave, pays their wages as usual, and also subsidizes them with two chickens, two catties of wine, twenty eggs, and five catties of black beans.

\tThe women of this commune are the main force in agricultural production. However, before the cooperativization, many women here had miscarriages during pregnancy due to overwork, or suffered from various diseases due to lack of adequate rest and nutrition after childbirth. Since the commune implemented the women's labor protection card system and postpartum care, women have never had miscarriages, and those after childbirth have recovered quickly. Female commune members Xu Chunxi and Ma Ernv said with infinite emotion: "In the past, women here had to go to work in the fields only three days after giving birth to a child, and being able to eat a jar of pickled sweet potato leaves during confinement was considered nutritious. Now that the commune cares and takes care of us like this, women are so happy!" (Li Zuoji) (Chen Zhi illustration)

### 照顾妇女特点  妥善安排劳动  中山县各公社  四会大沙公社实行妇女劳动保健牌制度

    照顾妇女特点  妥善安排劳动
    中山县各公社  四会大沙公社实行妇女劳动保健牌制度
    新华社广州讯  广东中山县各人民公社普遍重视妇女社员的劳动保护工作。
    各生产队推行了一种叫做“妇女劳动保健牌”的制度。牌的各栏登记着月经期的、怀孕的、哺乳的和产后的妇女名字。每天清晨出工前，生产队长或党支部书记都根据妇女劳动保健牌上所记的不同情况，分配适合她们生理特点的工作。例如经期的妇女调做干燥的活，不作潮湿的活；怀孕初期的妇女调做轻活不做重活；怀孕后期的妇女调做直腰干的活不做弯腰干的活；哺乳期的妇女调做近活，喂奶方便；妇女产后休假，工资照发。
    除了分配劳动上的这些照顾以外，各公社每生产区还都建立了一个以上的妇产院，做到所有产妇都能住院，产前得到经常的检查。各个公社还根据自己的条件规定给产妇以营养补助，有的发钱由产妇自理，有的由妇产院买营养品给产妇吃。另外，全县所有公社的女社员每月都有三天的假期，比男社员多一天。全县幼儿园、托儿所也已经办起四千一百一十六间，使90％以上的孩子能够入托。
    这个县在开始推行“妇女劳动保健牌”制度的时候，许多妇女特别是青年妇女不好意思把自己的月经、怀孕等事情记在牌上。个别干部担心会不会因此减少劳动力出勤。针对这种情况，中共中山县委先后召开了全县妇女干部和公社福利部长会议，深入进行思想发动，解除女社员的顾虑，使男社员认识到照顾妇女生理特点的必要。各公社也都召开现场会议，进行检查评比。因此，使这个制度很快就在全县普遍建立起来。
    实行“妇女劳动保健牌”制度以后，有效地保障了广大农村妇女的健康和促进了生产的发展。许多生产区和公社在贯彻了这个制度以后，从没有发生过小产现象，妇女生病的也更加少了。她们的生产积极性进一步高涨，劳动效率进一步提高。许多妇女表示，一定要更加积极地劳动，报答党对她们的关怀。
    本报讯  12月4日早晨，广东省四会县大沙公社第五连的妇女劳动保护登记牌上，有六块写了姓名的小竹牌挂在月经期栏内，怀孕期栏也有六名妇女挂牌，哺乳期的比较多，有二十六名。连指导员兼妇女主任邵肖平根据登记牌给女社员派适合她们生理特点的农活。
    这天，五连的晒坪上，十二名经期、孕期和两名刚过了月子不久的女社员，都在干晒谷、风谷、晒稻秆等轻活；哺乳期的则往返挑稻把，方便奶孩子。前一天在食堂吃午饭时，连指导员邵肖平原想派黄金好去车水浇地，黄金好说了一声：“今天有‘特殊情况’呀！”邵肖平知道她是月经来了，便改派她去晒谷。黄金好的丈夫在旁笑着说：“干部们照顾妇女可真周到啊！”另外，纵然在日夜苦战时，孕妇和奶妇也从不派夜工，不参加军事操练。对女社员除了实行劳动保护之外，这个公社成立后，已办起托儿所，幼儿园，全公社三岁以下的小孩都进了托儿所。三岁至七岁的也全部入了幼儿园。公社还办了妇产院，妇女们生小孩都住妇产院，怀孕的经常到妇产院去检查；公社对产妇给假期四十天，工资照发，另外还补助鸡两只，酒二斤，鸡蛋二十枚，乌豆五斤。
    这个公社的妇女是农业生产上的主力大军。但是，在合作化以前，这里却有不少妇女在怀孕期由于过度劳动发生小产，或产后没有适当休息和营养引起各种疾病。公社实行了妇女劳动保护挂牌制和产后照顾以来，妇女们从没发生过小产，产后的也迅速恢复健康。女社员徐春喜、马二女无限感慨地说：“过去我们这儿妇女生下小孩才过三天，就不能不下地干活，坐月子时能吃上一缸腌薯叶就算是营养了。现在公社这样关怀照顾，妇女们真太幸福哪！”  （黎作骥）（陈志插画）
