“Native” Nodular Cast Iron
A New Type of Cast Iron

"Native" nodular cast iron utilizes the abundant "native" iron produced in China, which is low in carbon, silicon, and manganese but high in sulfur and phosphorus. It is first cast into white iron castings and then annealed. Its graphite is in the form of spheroids, giving it high strength mechanical properties. Its mechanical strength greatly exceeds that of gray cast iron and even surpasses that of ordinary malleable cast iron, rivaling that of nodular cast iron. It is a new type of high-strength cast iron.

The production process of "native" nodular cast iron is more convenient than that of ordinary malleable cast iron. The annealing time is only a fraction of the latter's, and the composition requirements are wider. It is more convenient to produce than nodular cast iron, requiring no spheroidizing treatment and no use of expensive materials such as magnesium.

In short, "native" nodular cast iron can fully utilize native iron, is easy to obtain materials, is easy to manufacture, has simple technology, is easy to promote, has high strength, and is low in cost. It is a new type of cast iron that meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. It has broad development prospects in the machinery industry and urban and rural industrial production.

Production Process

(1) Chemical Composition

The sulfur-manganese ratio should generally be between one and four. If it is too low, spheroidization will be poor; if it is too high, the annealing time will be too long. At the same time, attention must be paid to the absolute values of sulfur and manganese. Generally, the sulfur content should be between 0.3% and 1%. If the sulfur content is too high, it will be difficult to eliminate white iron. When the carbon and silicon content are high, the sulfur-manganese ratio can be relatively increased.

For carbon and silicon content, the sum of carbon and silicon should be greater than 4%, but limited to not producing flake graphite in the as-cast state. If it is too low, annealing will be difficult. The silicon content can be between 1% and 2.5%, preferably between 1.5% and 2%; the carbon content is around 2.5%, and the carbon content should be increased as much as possible during melting.

Phosphorus has little effect on the shape of graphite, but lower phosphorus content results in better toughness. At the same time, the impact of phosphorus on the mechanical properties of castings is smaller than that of magnesium-treated nodular cast iron.

(2) Batching and Smelting

As long as the composition of the native iron meets the above requirements, it can be smelted in cupolas, three-section furnaces, crucible furnaces, acid furnaces, alkaline furnaces, and cold-blast or hot-blast furnaces.

Because native iron is low in carbon and silicon, high in sulfur, and has more slag and gas, its fluidity is poor. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to increase the iron melt temperature. The casting temperature is preferably above 1270 degrees Celsius. Adding 0.3% of table salt or other low-melting-point salts to the iron ladle can remove some of the gas and cause the slag to float, which can improve the fluidity of the iron melt.

(3) Annealing

The annealing temperature should be between 900 and 1000 degrees Celsius. The holding time depends on the composition of the casting and the thickness of the cross-section, generally six to twelve hours. Then cool in the furnace, or appropriately cool the furnace to below 700 degrees Celsius before cooling in the air. If low hardness and high toughness are required, it can be slowly cooled to 720 to 760 degrees Celsius after holding.

During annealing, in order to reduce the thickness of the oxide scale on the surface of the casting, the following coatings can be applied to the surface:

    Graphite powder plus water glass solution; lime water; graphite powder plus water. The first formulation is best.

During annealing, the furnace temperature should be uniform, and the furnace temperature difference should not exceed 50 degrees Celsius. Important and complex castings, as well as thin parts, should be boxed to prevent deformation. Other quality control methods can refer to the annealing processes of malleable cast iron and other castings.

    “土”球墨铸铁
    新型铸铁
    “土”球墨铸铁，利用我国目前生产的大量含碳、硅、锰低，含硫、磷高的土铁，先浇成白口铸件，然后经退火而成。其石墨呈圆球状，所以具有高强度的机械性能。它的机械强度大大超过了灰口铸铁，也超过一般的可锻铸铁，与球墨铸铁相媲美。它是一种新型的高强度铸铁。
    “土”球墨铸铁的生产过程比一般可锻铸铁方便，退火时间仅为后者的几分之一，而且成分要求较宽。它比球墨铸铁生产更加方便，无需进行球化处理，无需使用镁等贵重材料。
    总之，“土”球墨铸铁能充分利用土铁，取材容易，制造方便，技术简单，推广容易，强度高，成本低，是一种符合多快好省要求的新型铸铁。它在机械工业和城乡工业生产中有广阔的发展前途。
    生产工艺
    （一）化学成分
    硫、锰比值，一般以一至四为宜，低则球化不良，高则退火时间过长。同时，必须注意硫、锰的绝对值，一般含硫宜在0.3％至1％之间，含硫过高则白口难于消除。当碳、硅量高时，硫、锰比可以相对提高一些。
    碳、硅含量，碳、硅总和应大于4％，但以铸态不出片状石墨为限，过低则退火困难。硅分可在1％至2.5％之间，最好为1.5％至2％；碳量在2.5％左右，尽可能在熔化时使碳量有较多的增加。
    磷对石墨形状的影响不大，但低些韧性好些。同时，磷对铸件机械性能的影响，比加镁球墨铸铁为小。
    （二）配料及熔炼
    只要土铁成分符合上述要求，那末不论冲天炉，三节炉，搀炉，酸性炉，碱性炉，冷风热风炉，都可以熔炼。
    由于土铁中碳、硅分低，硫高，渣子多，气体多，所以流动性差。因此，必须设法提高铁水温度。浇铸温度最好在摄氏一千二百七十度以上。在铁水包中加入0.3％的食盐或其他熔点低的盐类，可以驱除一部分气体，并可使渣子上浮，这样能提高铁水流动性。
    （三）退火
    退火温度摄氏九百到一千度为宜。保温时间，根据铸件成分及断面厚度而定，一般为六至十二小时，然后在炉内冷却，或适当炉子冷至七百度以下，再在空气中冷却。如果要求硬度低，韧性大，可以在保温以后缓冷至七百二十至七百六十度。
    退火时，为了减少铸件表面氧化皮的厚度，可以在表面上涂以下涂料：
    石墨粉加水玻璃溶液；石灰水；石墨粉加水。其中第一种配料最好。
    退火时，应该保证炉温均匀，炉温差不超过摄氏五十度。重要和复杂的铸件以及薄件，应该装箱，以防止变形。其他质量控制方法，可参照可锻铸铁和其他铸件的退火工艺。
