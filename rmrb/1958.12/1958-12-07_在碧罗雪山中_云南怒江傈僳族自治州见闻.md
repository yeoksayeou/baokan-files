    In the Biluo Snow Mountain
    – Sights and Sounds from the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan
    By Our Correspondent Huang Changlu

    Mankind has traversed dozens of long centuries to finally overcome the pains of class society and enter the socialist era. However, some ethnic groups in our great family of nations, who in the past lived primitive lives, have, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the help of other advanced ethnic groups, completed in just a few short years a road that humanity usually takes thousands of years to complete. The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan is one such example.

    In the Gaoligong Mountains and Biluo Snow Mountains of the Hengduan Mountains in Yunnan, the roaring Nujiang River flows between them. In the high mountain canyons on both sides of the Nujiang River, tens of thousands of Lisu people live. For centuries, they have relied on crossbows to hunt wild animals and birds, while using wooden sticks to plant a little bit of crops on steep slopes and in rock crevices in order to survive. Because production tools were extremely primitive, and because of the isolation of the mountains, there was little contact with other ethnic groups in the motherland, so social development was very slow. Before liberation, a complete class society had not yet formed here. At that time, the Lisu people lived in extreme poverty, wearing linen clothes and warming themselves by the fire at night. They had no written language and could only use wood carvings to record events. ...

    But all of this has now become history. The Lisu Autonomous Prefecture achieved people's commune-ization before National Day this year. I visited one of the twenty communes in the autonomous prefecture – the Unity People's Commune. This commune has a total of 1,212 households, all of whom are Lisu, living on the east bank of the Nujiang River in the Biluo Snow Mountain. Here, every day you see and hear many exciting things.

    Stone Axes and Threshing Machines

    Early in the morning, the sound of a gong, shaking the valley, was heard from the Adouluo Brigade. Commune members followed the sound of the gong, singing mountain songs cheerfully as they headed to the fields. They also rested, ate, and slept to the sound of the gong. The sound of the gong has become the pulse of the new life of the Lisu commune members. However, the ancient sound of the gong also evokes deep memories for the Lisu people: not long ago, the sound of the gong was the horn used by headmen to summon members. At that time, many members cultivated and hunted together, and the harvest was distributed equally according to population. This distribution could not even maintain the most basic living standards. When the Nujiang River was under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Lisu people often heard this gong and would rush to take the old and the young into the primeval forests or caves to hide, because it was often a signal that officials and local bullies were coming to the countryside to collect grain and levies. In those years, although the Lisu people could harvest some grain after hard labor, most of it would be taken away by officials and local bullies, and they still had to live a primitive and difficult life. Forced to sell their sons and daughters, jumping into the Nujiang River to commit suicide, these things happened frequently. Therefore, this gong is also a mark of the old life of the Lisu people!

    But now, in the newly opened terraced fields of the Biluo Snow Mountain, the commune is busy with the autumn harvest. This year, the grain output of the Adouluo Brigade has increased by about six times compared to last year, and it has not yet been completely harvested after using threshing machines for a month. We came to the threshing ground of Paiba Village and saw several young Lisu men and women rhythmically treading on the threshing machine, golden grains pouring out like a torrential rain in all directions. One machine can thresh more than 1,000 catties of rice a day. In the Lamo family in this village, a stone axe is still preserved. Of course, none of this generation of Lisu people has ever used a stone axe, but young people in their twenties have used wooden hoes made of branches to dig the ground. Two years ago, the Lisu people still used their feet to thresh, one person stepping for a whole day, breaking their feet, and only being able to thresh 30 catties. Stone axes and threshing machines, these two kinds of production tools mark such a long period of social development history, and in the life of the Lisu people, it seems like it was yesterday and today!

    The First Generation of Workers

    The Lisu language does not yet have the word "worker." After the establishment of the Unity People's Commune, it began to establish its own industry, and now more than two hundred commune members have become the first generation of Lisu workers. The phrase "starting a business is difficult" has special significance here. I visited the Waping Iron Smelting Plant run by the commune. From the factory director to the workers, all are Lisu. Only A Yu Cai had been a blacksmith for two years, and the others didn't even know where iron came from. They set it up with the help of two cadres. At first, they mined according to a piece of stone that looked like iron that the commune member Hei Qian plowed up while plowing the land. They dug on this piece of land for three or four days, but it was all mud. But they were not discouraged. They dug more than ten feet deep before they found iron ore. With the ore, no one knew how to build a furnace, so the factory sent three people to carry food and walk for three days to Lushui County to see how it was done. They came back and built the furnace according to the way they saw it, but they didn't know how to make bellows, so they sent someone to walk for a day to the county town to ask someone to make bellows, dismantled it into five pieces, and five people carried it back. After many twists and turns, they finally smelted iron. Now, this factory has smelted more than 500 catties of pig iron, and the commune has used the iron it produces to make agricultural tools. Six people in the factory have mastered all the techniques of building furnaces and smelting iron. A Yu Cai is now the "old master" of the factory. He excitedly told the reporter: "When the commune produces more iron, I must learn to make machines!"

    Breakfast in the Canteen

    The Unity People's Commune has set up twelve public canteens, and more than 5,000 commune members all eat in the canteens. One day, we went to the canteen in Wadihang Village for breakfast. Because it was established not long ago, there was no time to build large houses. At present, there is only one kitchen, and commune members take their meals home to eat. We carried the food to the home of Lisu elder Hai Ji and ate with his family around the fire pit. The old man chewed on fragrant white rice and sweet pumpkin, his face shining with a happy smile. While eating, he told us that his family of four used to have only eight acres of steep slope land, and the corn they planted each year was only enough to eat for three months. For the remaining six months of the year, they relied on digging tree roots and wild vegetables on the snow-capped mountains or hunting birds and animals to fill their stomachs. He had spent sixty-nine years this way. After joining the agricultural cooperative last year, they collectively opened terraced fields, and after the autumn harvest, they were given 505 catties of rice. This was the first time in his life that he had tasted the taste of rice. After the establishment of the public canteen, rice is already a common meal. His daughter Shi Jia Niu interjected and said that in the past, she would hurry up to get up to start a fire and cook rice as soon as the rooster crowed, and corn was not easy to cook, so she couldn't eat breakfast until noon. Now she doesn't have to worry about these things anymore. Recently, she has also become a skilled worker using threshing machines in the autumn harvest team.

    New Pursuits

    On the hillside next to Wadihang Village, there is a unique terraced field, where wheat seedlings grow densely and vigorously. When the Lisu people pass by here, they have to stop and take a look. A wooden sign is erected on the ridge of the field, written in Lisu: "Cadre Experimental Field." I found Lu Shuna, the person in charge of this experimental field. He is a committee member of the People's Commune, but he is only twenty years old this year. He told me the story of growing the experimental field.

    After the establishment of the commune, someone suggested that production should be done like the Han elder brothers, planting for one year and eating for three years. In order to set an example first, the commune committee decided to plant experimental fields. Lu Shuna found several young activists, and two working cadres started working first. In the past, the Lisu people only dug two or three inches deep when planting land, but the experimental fields were deeply cultivated to two feet. When experienced Lisu elders saw it, they warned these young people: "You have turned over all the lean soil, are you thinking of harvesting a handful of grass?" The young people replied: "Our one jia of field (equivalent to two acres) will use three thousand loads (each load is one hundred catties) of fertilizer, and even lean soil will be turned into fertile soil." The old man shook his head and said, "Where are you going to find so much fertilizer?" The young people answered this question with practical actions. They cleared the grass on the ridges of the fields to make fertilizer; they cleaned the pig and cattle sheds in the village to make fertilizer; and if it was not enough, they climbed the cliffs to carry humus soil from the primeval forest on the snow-capped mountains to make fertilizer.

    When it came time to sow, the experimental field used two hundred catties of seeds per jia. In the past, a jia of wheat field at best only harvested two hundred catties. The kind-hearted old man ran over to persuade: "Are you crazy? Sowing so many seeds, you won't even get back your capital!" However, Lu Shuna visited the inland in August this year and saw with his own eyes that densely planted rice grew abundantly and well, and one jia of field was equivalent to dozens of jia, and thought: "If others can do it, we can do it too." He insisted on intensive planting.

    After the wheat seedlings emerged, the old people slowly admired this group of young people and learned from the experimental fields. Women and children also started experimental fields. This spark is developing with the force of a prairie fire.

    I asked Lu Shuna: "How much do you plan to harvest from your experimental field?"

    He replied confidently: "We heard that the best acre of wheat in the country harvested more than 7,000 catties. We want to catch up with it and harvest 15,000 from one jia of field."

    "Can you catch up?" I asked deliberately.

    "With the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to catch up!"

### 在碧罗雪山中——云南怒江傈僳族自治州见闻

    在碧罗雪山中
    ——云南怒江傈僳族自治州见闻
    本报记者  黄昌禄
    人类经历了几十个漫长的世纪，才越过了痛苦的阶级社会，开始进入社会主义的时代。但是在我们祖国的大家庭中的一些过去过着原始生活的民族，由于党的领导和其它先进民族的帮助，在短短的几年中，便走完了人类通常要几千年才能走完的道路。云南怒江傈僳族自治州，便是其一。
    在云南横断山脉的高黎贡山和碧罗雪山中，夹峙着奔腾而下的怒江，在怒江两岸的高山峡谷中，居住着数以万计的傈僳族人民。多少世纪以来，他们都是依靠弩箭猎取走兽飞禽，同时用木棍在陡坡和石缝中种植一点庄稼，以求生存。由于生产工具十分原始，加以大山阻隔，同祖国其它民族很少往来，因此社会发展十分缓慢。到解放前，这里还没有形成完整的阶级社会。那时，傈僳人的生活十分贫困，身穿麻布衣，夜间烤火取暖。没有文字，只能刻木记事。……
    但是，这一些现在已经成为历史了。傈僳族自治州已经在今年国庆节前实现了人民公社化。记者访问了自治州的二十个公社之一——团结人民公社。这个公社共一千二百一十二户，全是傈僳族，居住在怒江东岸的碧罗雪山上。在这里，每天都看到和听到许多激动人心的事情。
    石斧与打谷机
    清晨，在阿斗罗大队里传出了振撼山谷的铓声，公社社员随着铓声唱起山歌愉快地走向田间。又随着铓声休息、吃饭和睡觉。铓声，成了傈僳社员新生活的脉膊。可是，古老的铓声，也唤起了傈僳人深沉的回忆：就在距现在不远的年代里，铓声是头人召集成员的号角，那时许多成员在一起耕种和打猎，收获物按人口平均分配，这种分配物连最起码的生活都不能维持。怒江在国民党反动派的统治下时，傈僳人听到这铓声，还常常扶老携幼逃往原始森林或岩洞中躲藏，因为这往往也是官吏恶霸下乡，索粮派款的讯号。那些年月，傈僳人经过艰难的劳动，虽然也能收到一些粮食，但大部分要被官吏恶霸夺去，他们仍然得过原始的困苦生活。被逼得卖儿卖女，跳入怒江自杀的事，经常发生。因此这铓声，也是傈僳人旧生活的烙印呵！
    可是现在在碧罗雪山新开的梯田里，公社正在忙着秋收，阿斗罗大队今年的粮食产量比去年增加了大约六倍，用打谷机收了一个月还没收完。我们来到排坝村的打谷场，看见几个傈僳男女青年用脚有节奏地踏着打谷机，金黄色的谷粒暴雨般地向四方倾泻，一架机器每天可打一千多斤稻谷。而在这个村的拉末家里，现在还保存着一柄石斧。当然，这一代的傈僳人已经没有谁用过石斧了，可是，二十来岁的青年还使用过树枝作成的木锄挖地。两年以前，傈僳人打谷还在用脚踩，一人踩一天，把脚板踩破了也只能打三十斤。石斧与打谷机，这两种生产工具标志着多么漫长的一段社会发展史，而在傈僳人的生活中，好像是昨天和今天的事！
    第一代工人
    傈僳族的语言中还没有“工人”这个词汇，团结人民公社成立后，开始建立自己的工业，现在已经有二百多个社员成了傈僳族的第一代工人。“创业维艰”这句话在这里具有特殊的意义。我访问了公社办的娃平炼铁厂，从厂长到工人全部是傈僳人，其中只有阿玉才一人当过两年铁匠，其它人连铁从哪里出来也不知道。他们在两个干部的帮助下便办起来了。开初挖矿，唯一的根据是社员黑欠在犁地时犁出了一块像铁的石头。他们在这块地上挖了三、四天，都是泥巴，但没有灰心，一直挖了一丈多深，才挖着了铁矿。矿石有了，没有人知道怎样砌炉子，厂里就派出三个人背着粮食走三天路到泸水县去看。回来照着人家样子把炉子砌好了，却不会作风箱，又派人走了一天路到县城去请人作了个风箱，拆成五块，用五个人背回来。经过千波万折，最后终于炼出铁了。现在，这个厂已经炼出五百多斤生铁，公社用自己生产的铁造出了农具。厂里已有六个人掌握了砌炉和炼铁的全部技术。阿玉才现在成了厂里的“老师傅”了。他兴奋地对记者说：“等公社的铁生产多了，我一定要学会造机器！”
    食堂的早餐
    团结人民公社已办起了十二个公共食堂，五千多社员全部在食堂里吃饭。一天，我们来到娃底杭村的食堂吃早餐。因为成立不久，来不及盖大房子，目前暂时只有一个厨房，社员们把菜饭打回家里吃。我们把饭菜抬到傈僳老人亥机家，和他全家围着火塘同吃起来。老人嚼着香喷喷的白米饭和甜甜的南瓜，脸上闪烁着幸福的笑容。边吃饭边告诉我们，他家四口人过去只有八亩陡坡地，每年种的玉米只够吃三个月，余下的大半年日子靠到雪山上挖树根和野菜或猎取禽兽充饥，这样熬过了六十九年。去年加入农业社后，集体开了梯田，秋收后分得五百零五斤稻谷，这辈子才第一次尝到了米饭的滋味。成立公共食堂后，米饭已经是家常便饭了。他的姑娘使家扭插嘴进来说，以前，鸡一叫她就赶忙起来烧火煮饭，玉米不容易煮熟，快到中午才能吃早饭。现在她可以不再为这些事发愁了。最近她又在秋收队成了一名使用打谷机的能手。
    新的追求
    娃底杭村旁的山坡上，有一片奇特的梯田，麦苗长得又密又旺。傈僳人经过这里，都要停下来看看。田埂上树着一块木牌，用傈僳文写着“干部试验田”。我找着这片试验田的负责人卢书纳，他是人民公社的社务委员，但今年才二十岁，他向我谈起关于种试验田的故事来。
    公社成立后，有人提议要把生产搞得像汉族老大哥一样，种一年，吃三年。为了先作出个榜样，社委会决定种试验田。卢书纳找了几个青年积极分子，两个工作干部首先干起来。过去，傈僳人种地只挖两、三寸深，试验田深耕了两尺。有经验的傈僳老人看见了，警告这些年青人：“你们把瘦土都翻上来，莫不是想收一把草？”年青人回答说：“我们一架田（合两亩）要放三千背（每背一百斤）肥料，瘦土也要它变成肥土。”老人摇摇头说：“你们上哪里找这样多肥料？”青年们用实际行动回答了这个问题。他们把田埂上的草铲光了作肥料；把村里的猪牛厩扫干净了作肥料；还不够，就攀着悬岩峭壁到雪山上的原始森林里去背腐植土作肥料。
    开始播种了，试验田每架搞了两百斤种籽，过去一架麦田最好才收两百斤。好心的老人又跑来劝告：“你们疯了吗？撒这样多的种，连本也收不回来！”可是，卢书纳今年8月间到内地参观，亲眼看见密植的稻谷长得又多又好，一架田要顶几十架，心想：“人家能成，我们也能成。”坚持进行了密植。
    麦苗出土后，老人们慢慢地佩服这群年青人了，也学着试验田的样子作。妇女和儿童们也搞起试验田来。这星星之火，正以燎原之势发展着。
    我问卢书纳：“你们试验田打算收多少？”
    他很有信心地回答：“我们听说全国最好的一亩小麦收了七千多斤，我们想赶上它，一架田收一万五”。
    “能赶上吗？”我故意问。
    “有党的领导，一定能赶上！”（附图片）
