Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 3rd. The Central Political Bureau of the French Communist Party yesterday issued an appeal to French workers and all Republicans, calling on them to unite and defend freedom.

The appeal pointed out that the first and second rounds of voting in the National Assembly elections confirmed the advance of the extreme reactionary and fascist forces represented by the "Union for the New Republic" headed by Soustelle. The appeal pointed out that this was made possible by the policies pursued by the Socialist Party leaders, who on the one hand incited and promoted chauvinism, and on the other hand carried out anti-communist division of workers and democratic forces, and finally did not hesitate to form alliances with the worst reactionaries, with the "Union for the New Republic" headed by Soustelle in the elections.

The appeal said that facing the new situation after the elections, the French Communist Party, which has the unwavering trust of four million French people, issued an urgent appeal to all forces against dictatorship and fascism, calling on them to unite to achieve the policies expected by the whole country:

	Strive to save freedom and restore democracy;
	Force (the government) to achieve peace in Algeria through negotiations;
	Ensure the basic living standards of workers;
	Divert the billions of francs spent on war to civilian investment to avoid economic crises;
	Ensure the development of French culture and protect public schools;
	Strive to pursue a truly national foreign policy that is entirely dependent on national interests.

The appeal said that the French Communist Party, which is more than ever a powerful republican force in the country, called on all French people to unite to strive for tomorrow's victory.

Xinhua News Agency, December 4th. Paris News: The Central Committee of the "Union for the New Republic," known as the Soustelle Party, issued a statement on the 3rd, vigorously boasting that it has a "majority" in the National Assembly and instructed all members of the party to "actively participate in the election of General De Gaulle as President of the Republic."

The committee also decided on the 2nd to dissolve all parties that joined the "Union for the New Republic" before the election, so that the "Union for the New Republic" would become a "national" party.

Duverger published an article in "Le Monde" on the 3rd exposing the so-called "majority" of the Soustelle Party in the National Assembly, saying that this "majority" is a "majority based on a minority," which is disproportionate to the influence of the "Union for the New Republic" in the country. Duverger wrote, "It should not be forgotten that now each Communist member of the National Assembly represents 388,000 voters, a Socialist member represents 79,000 voters, and a member of the 'Union for the New Republic' represents only 21,000 voters. Never in the history of our republic has there been such inequality." Duverger emphasized that those who voted for the Soustelle Party accounted for less than 20% of the total number of voters. "Even if this new party has almost a majority in the National Assembly and has the support of members from Algeria, it should consider that it is in the minority domestically."

    法共中央政治局发出紧急呼吁
    号召人民团结起来拯救民主自由
    法西斯政党“保卫新共和联盟”正为戴高乐当总统开路
    新华社巴黎3日电  法国共产党中央委员会政治局昨天发表了告法国劳动者和所有共和人士的呼吁书，号召他们团结一致，保卫自由。
    呼吁书指出，国民议会选举的第一轮和第二轮投票证实了以苏斯戴尔为首的“保卫新共和联盟”所代表的极端反动势力和法西斯势力的推进。呼吁书指出，这所以成为可能，是由于社会党领导人所奉行的政策，这种政策一方面鼓动和宣扬沙文主义，另一方面对工人和民主力量进行反共的分化，最后又毫不犹豫地在选举时同最恶劣的反动派、同以苏斯戴尔为首的“保卫新共和联盟”缔结联盟。
    呼吁书说，面临着选举之后的新形势，得到四百万法国人的不可动摇的信任的法国共产党，向反对独裁和法西斯主义的一切力量发出紧急呼吁，号召他们团结一致争取实现全国所期待的政策：
    争取拯救自由、恢复民主；
    迫使（政府）通过谈判在阿尔及利亚实现和平；
    确保劳动者的起码的生活水平；
    把用于战争的以数十亿法郎计的开支作为民用投资以求避免经济危机；
    保证发扬法国的文化，保障公立学校；
    争取奉行完全取决于民族利益的真正民族外交政策。
    呼吁书说，比以往任何时候更加成为国内强大的共和力量的法国共产党，向全体法国人发出呼吁，号召他们团结起来争取明天的胜利。
    新华社4日讯  巴黎消息：被称为苏斯戴尔党的“保卫新共和联盟”中央委员会3日发表声明，竭力吹嘘它在国民议会中占有“多数”并且指示这个党的全体议员“积极参加选举戴高乐将军为共和国总统”。
    这个委员会2日还作出决定，解散在选举前加入“保卫新共和联盟”的一切党派，以便使“保卫新共和联盟”成为“全国性”的政党。
    杜维歇3日在“世界报”上发表一篇揭露苏斯戴尔党在国民议会中的所谓“多数”的文章说，这个“多数”是“以少数为基础的多数”，它同“保卫新共和联盟”在国内的影响是不相称的。杜维歇写道，“不应该忘记，现在在国民议会中每一个共产党议员今后代表三十八万八千选民，社会党议员代表七万九千选民，而‘保卫新共和联盟’议员只代表二万一千选民。在我们共和国历史中，从来没有如此的不平等。”杜维歇强调指出，投苏斯戴尔党的票的人只占选民总数不到20％。“即使这个新党在国民议会中差不多占多数并有来自阿尔及利亚的议员的支持，但是它应当考虑，它在国内处于少数地位。”
