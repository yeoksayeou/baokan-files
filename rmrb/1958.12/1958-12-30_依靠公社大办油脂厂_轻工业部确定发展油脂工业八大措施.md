Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th—The Ministry of Light Industry convened the Fifth National Oil Industry Conference in Nanchang City from the 16th to the 25th to study how to further develop the oil industry in the context of the nationwide great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

    The conference summarized the experience of oil industry production in 1958, and studied and deployed production tasks for 1959. The conference believes that, thanks to the correct leadership of party committees at all levels and the breaking of superstitions and the liberation of thought by the broad masses of workers, the oil industry has achieved great success in comprehensive utilization, diversified operations, and technological innovation. At the same time, the oil industry has initially implemented the policy of going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, and running more small factories. Small-scale oil factories have begun to develop in the people's communes, laying the foundation for further development of the oil industry in 1959.

    The conference analyzed the national oil production situation and believes that insufficient equipment capacity will be the main problem in next year's production. In order to increase the equipment capacity for national oil and soap production more and faster to meet the needs of developing oil crop production, the conference emphasized that at the present stage, special reliance should be placed on the nation's 20,000-plus people's communes to mobilize them to vigorously establish joint oil factories. According to surveys in various places, the people's communes also have an urgent need to run oil factories, because the people's communes need edible oil, as well as feed and fertilizer. Old oil factories and soap factories should provide active support to commune-run oil factories.

    In order to ensure the development of the oil industry, the conference believes that the following eight major measures should also be grasped: 1. Vigorously tap the equipment potential of existing oil factories; 2. Vigorously promote the water displacement method, i.e., the original Chinese method of producing small-mill sesame oil; 3. Adopt the steps of starting with indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and using indigenous methods first and then foreign methods, vigorously promote oil extraction methods, and actively promote simple oil extraction; 4. Actively manufacture new and lightweight oil presses to increase the equipment capacity of the oil industry; 5. Strive to basically realize the mechanization of indigenous oil workshops within about a year to improve working conditions and improve production efficiency; 6. Actively develop new products, such as soap powder and synthetic detergents; 7. Vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of resources. In addition to further promoting the comprehensive utilization of rice bran, cottonseed, soybeans, peanuts, flax and other oil crops, the comprehensive utilization of cottonseed hulls, sunflowers, and other agricultural and sideline products to extract alcohol, furfural, etc. using indigenous methods should also be universally promoted. In the southern provinces producing tea seeds and tung seeds, efforts should be made to engage in the comprehensive utilization of tea seeds and tung seeds; 8. Strengthen scientific research in the oil industry to promote the continuous improvement of the technical level of the oil industry.

    依靠公社大办油脂厂
    轻工业部确定发展油脂工业八大措施
    新华社南昌29日电  轻工业部16日到25日在南昌市召开全国第五次油脂工业会议，研究了在全国工农业大跃进的形势下，如何进一步发展油脂工业的问题。
    会议总结了1958年油脂工业生产的经验，并且研究和部署了1959年的生产任务。会议认为，一年来由于各级党委的正确领导，广大职工破除迷信，解放思想，油脂工业在综合利用、多种经营、技术革新上，都获得了很大成绩。同时，油脂工业初步贯彻了上山下乡、多办小厂的方针。小型的油脂工厂开始在人民公社中发展，为1959年进一步发展油脂工业打下了基础。
    会议分析了全国油脂生产情况，认为设备能力不足将是明年生产中的主要问题。为了使全国油脂和肥皂生产设备能力更多更快地增长，以适应发展油料生产的需要，会议强调指出，在现阶段应特别依靠全国两万多个人民公社，发动人民公社大办油脂联合厂。根据各地调查，人民公社也有办油厂的迫切要求，因为人民公社既需要食油，也需要饲料和肥料。老油脂厂和肥皂厂应对公社办油厂给予积极支援。
    为了保证油脂工业的发展，会议认为还应抓住以下八大措施：一、大力挖掘现有油脂工厂的设备潜力；二、大力推广水代法，即中国原有小磨麻油的生产方法；三、采取土法上马，土洋结合和先土后洋的步骤，大力推广油脂浸出法，积极推行简易油脂浸出；四、积极制造新式而又轻便的榨油机，增加油脂工业的设备能力；五、力争一年左右使土榨油坊基本上实现土法机械化，以改善劳动条件和提高生产效率；六、积极发展新产品，例如皂粉和合成洗涤剂等；七、大力开展资源综合利用。除了进一步推广米糖、棉子、大豆、花生、亚麻等油料的综合利用外，还应普遍地利用棉籽壳、向日葵，以及其它农副产品，用土法提取酒精、糠醛等。在南方各省产茶籽和桐籽的地区，要设法搞茶籽和桐籽的综合利用；八、加强油脂工业的科学研究，以促进油脂工业技术水平不断提高。
