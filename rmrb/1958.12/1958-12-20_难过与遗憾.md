    Sadness and Regret
    When U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree arrived in Baghdad, he was spat upon and driven away by the Iraqi people, which made Rountree himself feel very "sad," and the State Department also expressed "regret."

    Rountree's "sadness" is understandable. First, a dignified Assistant Secretary of State visiting another country actually ended up sneaking out of the airport's back door, still unable to avoid being pelted with stones and mud, which is really too disgraceful. Second, Rountree was carrying a bellyful of conspiracies to conduct activities in Iraq, but before he even arrived, his conspiracy was seen through, which is really too unlucky. How could Rountree not be sad?

    As for the U.S. State Department's "regret," that is completely unnecessary. Rountree went with malicious intentions and ended up being expelled by the Iraqi people; this is precisely a case of "reaping what you sow," so what is there to "regret"? The U.S. State Department spokesperson even falsely accused the Iraqi people who protested Rountree's "visit" of being "subversives," which is simply ridiculous. The subversive elements in Iraq should be warmly welcoming this schemer from the United States. As the Baghdad newspapers pointed out, one of Rountree's purposes in coming to Iraq was to encourage the schemers there. So how could they tell Rountree to get lost?

    What is particularly absurd is that the U.S. State Department openly demanded that the Iraqi government take steps to prevent such incidents from happening again. If the U.S. authorities really hope that such incidents will not happen again, they should take some effective steps themselves, which is to send fewer schemers in diplomatic attire to meddle everywhere.

### 难过与遗憾

    难过与遗憾
    美国助理国务卿朗特里到达巴格达的时候，受到伊拉克人民的唾骂和怒逐，这使得朗特里本人很感“难过”，而国务院发言人也表示“遗憾”。
    朗特里的“难过”是可以理解的。第一，堂堂一个助理国务卿到别一个国家去访问，竟弄到要从机场的后门溜走，仍然免不了挨受石头和泥巴，实在太不光彩。第二，朗特里是带着一肚子阴谋要到伊拉克进行活动的，结果人还未到达，阴谋便被看穿，实在太不走运。朗特里怎能不难过呢？
    至于美国国务院的“遗憾”，那就大可不必了。朗特里不怀好意而去，结果受到伊拉克人民的驱逐，这正是“咎由自取”，有何可“遗憾”的呢？美国国务院发言人居然反诬抗议朗特里去“访问”的伊拉克人民是“颠复分子”，这就未免太可笑了。伊拉克的颠复分子对于这位来自美国的阴谋家倒是要热烈欢迎的。正如巴格达报纸所指出的，朗特里到伊拉克的目的之一就是要给那里的阴谋者打气。那末他们怎会叫朗特里滚蛋呢？
    尤其荒唐的是：美国国务院公然要求伊拉克政府采取步骤防止这种事件重演。如果美国当局真的希望不再发生这样的事件，还是自己采取一些有效的步骤罢，那就是少让那些穿着外交礼服的阴谋家到处乱钻。
