To systematically organize and publish China's fundamental historical texts, Zhonghua Book Company will begin organizing and publishing the "Punctuated and Annotated Edition" and the "Punctuated Popular Edition" of the Twenty-Four Histories starting in 1959. A preliminary organization plan has now been formulated.

Punctuated and Annotated Edition: It is planned to organize existing works such as "Annotations to the Book of Han" (Wang Xianqian), "Collected Explanations of the Book of the Later Han" (Wang Xianqian), "Collected Explanations of the Records of the Three Kingdoms" (Lu Bi), "Collated Notes to the Book of Jin" (Wu Shijian), "Combined Annotations of the Books of Tang" (Wang Xianqian), and "Notes on the History of the Five Dynasties" (Peng Yuanrui), and add newly compiled "Collected Annotations of the Records of the Grand Historian" and "Supplementary Annotations to the Histories of the Northern and Southern Dynasties" (referencing Li Qing's "Combined Annotations of the Histories of the Northern and Southern Dynasties" and later textual research and stone inscriptions, etc.). In this way, the above eight annotated historical works will actually include nineteen histories, namely the "Collected Annotations of the Histories of the Northern and Southern Dynasties" (including the histories of Song, Southern Qi, Liang, Chen, Sui, Northern Wei, Northern Qi, and Northern Zhou), "Combined Annotations of the Books of Tang" (including the Old Book of Tang), and "Notes on the History of the Five Dynasties" (including the Old History of the Five Dynasties). As for whether new collected annotations will be made for the five histories of Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Ming, a final decision has not yet been made.

Ordinary Punctuated Edition: It is planned to collate, paragraph, and punctuate the current editions of the Twenty-Four Histories. A specific edition will be determined as the base text for each history, and it will be collated with other versions, and reference will be made to other textual research and notes, etc. The ordinary punctuated editions of the first four histories (Records of the Grand Historian, Book of the Former Han, Book of the Later Han, and Records of the Three Kingdoms) will be published before the National Day in 1959.

    中华书局整理出版二十四史
    为了有系统地整理出版我国历史基本古籍，中华书局将从1959年开始整理出版二十四史的“标点集注本”和“标点普通本”。初步整理计划现已制定。
    标点集注本：拟将已有的“汉书补注”（王先谦）、“后汉书集解”（王先谦）、“三国志集解”（卢弼）、“晋书斠注”（吴士鉴）、“唐书合注”（王先谦）和“五代史注”（彭元瑞）等加以整理，加上拟新编的“史记集注”和“南北史补注”（参考李清的“南北史合注”和后出的考证及石刻文学等）。这样，以上八部集注史书，实际上就包括了十九史，即“南北史集注”（包括宋、南齐、梁、陈、隋、北魏、北齐、北周八史）、“唐书合注”（包括旧唐书）和“五代史注”（包括旧五代史）。至于宋、辽、金、元、明五史是否作新的集注，尚未最后决定。
    普通标点本：拟依照通行本二十四史，加以校勘、分段和标点。每史确定一种版本为底本，用其他版本校勘，并参考其他考证和笔记等。前四史（史记、前汉书、后汉书和三国志）的普通标点本，将在1959年国庆节以前出版。
