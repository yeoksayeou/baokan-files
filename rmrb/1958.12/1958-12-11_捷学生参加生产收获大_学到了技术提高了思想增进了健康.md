Xinhua News Agency, Prague—Czechoslovakia has been implementing the policy of combining education with production in fifteen key schools nationwide since the autumn of this year, and has achieved good results so far.

    Students in these schools begin with one hour of physical labor per week from the first grade. As the grade level increases, the weekly labor time also gradually increases. By the tenth grade, there are ten hours of production labor per week, with approximately one month of labor time per semester.

    Students have learned skills such as raising livestock, planting, weaving, and building houses through labor. Currently, many students are able to work independently. Students are working everywhere in automobile factories, food processing factories, metallurgical plants, sugar refineries, agricultural cooperatives, and state farms.

    The combination of education and productive labor has also cultivated students' spirit of hard work and endurance. In the beginning, some people felt tired, but most of them persevered, and their bodies became healthier and stronger. In particular, workers and farmers enthusiastically helped and influenced them during labor, enabling them to learn many excellent qualities from the working people.

    In addition, students often participate in various voluntary labor activities on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, such as helping with harvesting, building public sports fields, and cleaning parks.

    In 1959, the policy of combining education with labor will be promoted in more secondary schools in Czechoslovakia.

    捷学生参加生产收获大
    学到了技术提高了思想增进了健康
    据新华社布拉格讯  捷克斯洛伐克从今年秋季开始在全国范围内选择了十五个重点学校试行教育与生产相结合的方针，到目前为止已经取得了良好的成绩。
    这些学校的学生从一年级开始每周就有一小时的体力劳动。随着年级的上升，每周劳动的时间也逐渐增加。到十年级时，每周就有十小时的生产劳动，每学期大约有将近一个月的劳动时间。
    学生们在劳动中学到了驯养家畜、播种、纺织、修建房屋等技能。目前许多学生已经能独立工作了。在汽车制造厂、食品加工工厂、冶金厂、炼糖厂、农业合作社和国营农场，到处都有学生们在劳动。
    教育和生产劳动相结合也培养了学生们吃苦耐劳的精神。开始的时候，有一些人感到很累，但大部分都坚持下来了，而且身体变得更加健康、更加结实，特别是在劳动中工人和农民都十分热情地帮助和影响他们，使他们从劳动人民身上学到了许多优秀的品质。
    此外，在星期六下午和星期天学生们还经常参加各种义务劳动，例如帮助进行收割工作、建筑公共体育运动场和清扫公园等。
    1959年，教育与劳动相结合的方针将在捷克斯洛伐克更多的中学推广。
