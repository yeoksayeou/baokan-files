Open Hearth Furnace Doctor

    The No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant is like a battlefield, with red-hot steel sparks flying everywhere and cranes moving molten steel back and forth. Engaged in intense combat here are not only the workers directly involved in steelmaking, but also the "engineers" who serve steelmaking - the furnace repair workers.

    On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, when Zhang Pu, the head of the furnace repair section, was repairing the No. 2 five-ton open hearth furnace with the furnace repair workers, suddenly the wind eye of the No. 1 five-ton open hearth furnace was burned out again, and the molten iron from the cupola furnace could not be sent into the open hearth furnace for steelmaking, and molten iron was flowing all over the ground. Everyone was very anxious. Zhang Pu immediately ran to the duty director and made a request:

    "I want to use the hot repair method to rush repair the open hearth furnace, please approve it." As soon as the duty director agreed, he quickly ran back to the front of the furnace, grabbed a handful of magnesia mud and patched the gap in the wind eye brick, ignoring the high temperature of more than 1,300 degrees, and inserted iron pipes into the wind eye that was about to burn out. In less than an hour, the five-ton open hearth furnace continued to operate again.

    After the No. 1 five-ton open hearth furnace was repaired, people began to talk about it. Some workers praised:

    "Zhang Pu is really good, brave and resourceful. The furnace is so hot, and he just reaches out to repair it. I've never seen anything like it."

    "It's also strange, why didn't the furnace, which is more than a thousand degrees hot, burn him?"

    Zhang Pu himself also found it strange: "Yes! The furnace is so hot, more than a thousand degrees, why didn't I get burned when I patched the wind eye just now?" He got a little inspiration from this: "Since you can hot repair the wind eye, why can't you hot dig the wind eye? If you can replace the wind eye with a new one in a planned way when the wind eye is about to break, wouldn't it extend the life of the furnace?"

    He took out a piece of paper from his pocket and wanted to put it on the wind eye to test the temperature. But before he could deliver it, the paper was blown into the furnace by the wind.

    "Ah! So that's how it is!" Zhang Pu found that more than a thousand degrees was only the temperature inside the furnace, and the wind eye was an air vent, not so hot. This little experiment made Zhang Pu extremely happy. He thought to himself: This time there is a way. The cupola furnace workers always challenge us, asking the open hearth furnace to drink up all their molten iron. In the past, we often couldn't drink it all and poured the molten iron on the ground. Now we can guarantee to give as much as we drink.

    Zhang Pu found the workshop's female technician Yan Feng, told her his thoughts and the situation of the wind eye test just now. Then he found the old workers Bi Shuchen and Liu Yipin, the youth group leader Zhang Chun, and others to study the method of repairing the wind eye of the open hearth furnace by hot replacing the wind eye.

    Hot replacing the wind eye is originally a relatively simple thing; but in the past, many people thought the furnace was too hot and did not dare to use this method. Therefore, often because the wind eye was broken, steelmaking was stopped for twenty-four hours, the refractory bricks in the furnace were removed and rebuilt, which seriously affected the output of steel.

    The leaders of the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop actively supported the initiative of Zhang Pu and others, and let them experiment on a one-and-a-half-ton small open hearth furnace whose wind eye was about to break after having already refined more than twenty furnaces of steel. In practice, they only used four hours to replace the wind eye, and the small open hearth furnace continued to operate until the fifty-third furnace before it needed to be shut down for repairs. This experiment proved that the method of hot replacing the wind eye can double the life of the open hearth furnace, and can also take advantage of the favorable conditions of the enlarged furnace chamber to increase steel production.

    After the successful experiment of hot replacing the wind eye, Zhang Pu and the female technician Yan Feng and others were praised by the leaders.

    Zhang Pu was originally a cast steel worker, and was an "outsider" to repairing open hearth furnaces. In September of this year, he was transferred to be the head of the furnace repair section. The furnace repair work plays a very important role in steelmaking. At first, he was very scared: how can I be the head of the section if I don't understand furnace repair technology? But at that time, the fact that people from all over the country participated in steelmaking in large numbers encouraged him to fight against difficulties. When he was at work, he repaired furnaces with Liu Yipin and Bi Shuchen, and when he was off work, he asked the female technician Yan Feng to talk about furnace repair theory. He always carried a "dolomite refractory material" in his pocket, reading it whenever he had time, and asking questions whenever he didn't understand. After several months of hard study, the "outsider" became an insider; colleagues called him "open hearth furnace doctor".

    转炉医生

    北京钢厂第一炼钢车间像一个战场，火红的钢花四溅，吊车来回运着钢水。在这里紧张地进行战斗的不仅有直接从事炼钢的工人，而且有为炼钢服务的“工兵”——修炉工人。
    本月5日下午，修炉工段段长张朴正同修炉工人们修理二号五吨转炉的时候，忽然一号五吨转炉的风眼又烧坏了，冲天炉化出的铁水不能送进转炉炼钢，流得满地都是铁水。大家都急坏了。张朴立即跑到值班主任面前提出要求：
  “我要用热补的办法抢修转炉，请你批准。”值班主任刚表示同意，他就飞快地跑回炉前，不顾一千三百多度的高温，抓起一把镁砂泥补上了风眼砖的缺口，又把快烧坏的风眼插上铁管。不到一小时，五吨转炉又继续运转起来了。
    一号五吨转炉修好以后，人们都议论开了。有的工人称赞说：
    “张朴真是好样的，又勇敢，又机智，炉子那么热，就伸手修炉，真没见过。”
    “也奇怪，为什么热得一千多度的炉子，没烫坏他呢？”
    张朴自己也觉得奇怪：“是呀！炉子太热，一千多度，为什么我刚才补风眼没烫坏我呢？”他从这里得到了一点启示：“既然可以热补风眼，怎么就不能热挖风眼呢？如果能在风眼快坏的时候就有计划地换成新风眼，不是就能延长炉子的寿命吗？”
    他从口袋里拿出一张纸，想放到风眼口试验一下温度。可是没等他送到，纸就被风送进炉子里去了。
    “啊！原来是这样！”张朴发现一千多度只是炉子里边的温度，而风眼是送风口，并不是那么热。这个小小的试验，使张朴高兴极了。他心里想：这回可有办法了。冲天炉工人老向我们挑战，让转炉喝干他们的铁水，过去常常喝不干，把铁水往地上倒，现在可能保证给多少喝多少了。
    张朴找到车间女技术员阎峰，把他的想法和刚才试验风眼的情况告诉了她。随后又找到老工人毕书臣和刘依品，青年组长张淳等，一块研究用热换风眼的办法修理转炉风眼。
    热换风眼，本来是一件比较简单的事；但过去很多人认为炉子太热，不敢采用这种办法。因此，常常因为风眼坏了，停止炼钢二十四小时，把炉内耐火砖拆掉重砌，严重地影响着钢的产量。
    第一炼钢车间的领导上积极支持张朴等人的倡议，让他们在已经炼了二十多炉钢的风眼快坏的一吨半小转炉上试验。在实践中，他们只用四个小时就换好了风眼，小转炉一直运转到五十三炉时才需要停炉修理。这次试验证明：用热换风眼的办法，能使转炉炉龄延长一倍，而且还可以利用炉膛扩大的有利条件，增加了钢产量。
    热换风眼试验成功以后，张朴和女技术员阎峰等都受到了领导上的表扬。
    张朴原来是个铸钢工人，对修转炉是“外行”。今年9月，他被调作修炉工段段长。修炉工作对炼钢多少起着很重要的作用。开始，他心里很害怕：不懂修炉技术怎么能当段长呢？但当时全国各地人民都大批参加炼钢的事实鼓舞着他向困难作斗争。上班时他同刘依品和毕书臣一块修炉，下班时就找女技术员阎峰讲修炉理论。他口袋里总是装着一本“白云石耐火材料”，有空就看，不懂就问。经过几个月的苦心钻研，“外行”变成了内行；同事们都称他作“转炉医生”。
