Dongwang Village Blacksmith Shop Mass Produces Indigenous Generators

(Reported by our newspaper) Several blacksmiths at the Dongwang Village Ironwork Cooperative in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, using various substitute materials and overcoming numerous difficulties in the absence of technical personnel and machinery, successfully trial-produced indigenous generators. To date, in just over three months, they have manufactured three 1.5 kW generators, 36 distribution panels, three water turbines (with a maximum capacity of 70 kW), and parts for 15 generator sets. In the process of manufacturing the generators, they also built three simple lathes to equip themselves. They are now mass-producing 3.5 kW generators and preparing to trial-produce transformers. They plan to produce 30,000 kW of generators next year.

In early July, the county committee officially decided that the Dongwang Village Iron Production Cooperative would specialize in manufacturing generators, and decided to expand the cooperative's factory buildings, establish an electrical engineering school, and transfer 51 senior primary school graduates to study and assist the cooperative in trial-producing motors. Initially, when the members heard this news, there was much discussion. Most believed: they were blacksmiths, only able to forge hoes and shovels, had never seen a motor, and had no machines. Wasn't this a joke? After everyone aired their opinions and debated, they finally bravely undertook the trial production task. Comrade Guo Chengyi, an ordinary telephone operator, was the cooperative's only technical personnel. They saw in the newspaper that the Liangxiang Repair Factory in Beijing had made indigenous motors, so Guo Chengyi led a fitter and two blacksmiths to Liangxiang to learn. After returning, they began trial-producing generators. In the trial production process, they encountered many difficulties. From July 13th, after 18 days of hard work, they finally made the first 1.5 kW DC generator. But after it was made, it could not generate electricity, so they had to carry the motor back to Liangxiang for guidance. After inspection, it was found that there were only some obstacles in the magnetic circuit, and after a little repair, it officially generated electricity.

Immediately afterwards, they made the second one in 12 days. At that time, the masses of the whole cooperative were very confident and thought it was foolproof, but after continuous trial operation for half a day, it still could not generate electricity. At this time, various opinions arose again. Some said, "Don't try to be brave. If a rabbit can pull a cart, who would want to buy a horse?" But under the encouragement of the county committee and the Party branch of the Ironwork Cooperative, after carefully checking the drawings and inspecting the circuits, they still could not find the problem. Just when they were at their "wit's end," they suddenly discovered that the position of the carbon brush was just turned ninety degrees in the wrong direction. Thus, after adjustment, current was immediately generated.

The motors they manufacture are very indigenous, adopting many methods of using local materials and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Therefore, this is a product that is very easy to promote and manufacture. For example, black iron sheet and iron plates are used instead of silicon steel sheets, waste cement bag paper (kraft paper) is used instead of insulating paper, etc. At present, they are preparing to trial-produce substitute materials for silicon steel sheets by indigenous methods and manufacture wires with indigenous methods and indigenous materials. They put forward the bold slogan: Determined to use all self-made materials to build motors! (Attached photo)

### 电机工业冒出星星之火  东汪村铁匠炉成批生产土发电机

    电机工业冒出星星之火
    东汪村铁匠炉成批生产土发电机
    本报讯  河北省邢台县东汪村铁业社的几个铁匠，在没有技术人员和机器设备的条件下，利用各种代用材料，克服了许多困难，试制成功土发电机。到目前为止，在三个多月的时间内，共造成了一点五瓩发电机三台，配电盘三十六个，水轮机三台（最大容量七十瓩），十五套发电机的配件。在制造电机过程中，为了装备自己，还制成简易车床三台。现正在成批制造三点五瓩的发电机，准备试制变压器。并计划在明年生产发电机三万瓩。
    7月初，县委正式决定东汪村的铁业生产社专门制造发电机，并决定扩建该社厂房，成立电工学校，调集了高小毕业生五十一人，一面学习，一面协助这个社试制电机。最初，社员们听到这个消息时，议论纷纷，一般认为：自己是打铁的，只会打铁镐锨，既没见过电机，又没有机器，这岂不是开玩笑吗？经过大家鸣放辩论，终于勇敢地承担了试制任务。一个普通电话员郭成义同志，是全社唯一的技术人员。他们在报纸上看到北京市良乡修造厂造成了土电机，就由郭成义带领一个钳工和两个铁匠，到良乡去学习。回来后，就开始试制发电机。在试制过程中，曾遇到很多困难。从7月13日起，经过十八天的奋战，才算把第一台一点五瓩的直流发电机造成了。但制成后却发不出电来，只好扛着电机又到良乡去求教，经过检查，发现只是磁回路中有些障碍，稍加修理，就正式发电了。
    紧接着又用十二天的时间，制成了第二台。当时全社群众信心很高，以为万无一失，但是连续试运转了半天，却发不出电来。这时，各种议论又发生了。有的说：“别逞强了，兔子能驾辕，谁还肯买马呢？”但是在县委和铁业社的党支部鼓励下，经过仔细核对图纸，检查线路，还是找不出毛病，正在“山穷水尽”的时候，突然发现只是炭刷的位置摆错了九十度。这样，经过调整，马上就发出了电流。
  他们制造的电机是十分土的，采用了许多就地取材，土洋结合的办法，因此这是很易推广制造的产品。例如：用黑铁皮和铁板代替矽钢片，用废水泥袋纸（牛皮纸）代替绝缘纸等等。目前正准备用土办法试制矽钢片代用材料，用土办法、土材料制造导线。他们提出了豪迈的口号：决心全部用自己制造的材料，造出电机来。（附图片）
