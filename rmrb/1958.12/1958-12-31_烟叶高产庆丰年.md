High Yield of Tobacco Celebrates a Bountiful Year
The Xiangcheng People's Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
With soaring enthusiasm, the people of Xiangcheng, under the leadership of the Party, after strenuous efforts in 1958, cultivated over 130,000 mu of tobacco throughout the county, with tall stalks, large leaves, and dense, neat rows. The average height of each plant was over six feet, with an average of sixty leaves per plant, and the highest having more than three hundred leaves. The largest leaves were three feet two inches long and two feet two inches wide. The masses described this year's tobacco harvest as: "Tobacco plants as tall as trees, tobacco leaves as big as mats, tobacco fields like tobacco stacks, picking tobacco requires ladders."

	Grasping Grain and Tobacco Simultaneously
The great harvest of tobacco in our county was not achieved smoothly. Before 1957, although the planting area was completed every year, the yield was not high. Individual leading comrades in the county, townships, and communes always emphasized objective difficulties, saying that there was too much rain, serious pests, and that natural disasters were irresistible, etc. Therefore, there were many doubts about whether this year's tobacco production could achieve a great leap forward. Some of the masses did not fully understand the importance of tobacco in the entire national economy. In order to fundamentally reverse the situation, the county Party committee organized a great leap forward in flue-cured tobacco production this year, and carried out criticism and debate from top to bottom during the mass rectification movement, criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, thereby boosting morale. At the county Party committee's rectification meeting for township and commune cadres on February 12th, the county Party committee also put forward the slogan: "Grasp grain with one hand, grasp tobacco with the other, grasp both hands together, and achieve a leap forward in both grain and tobacco." During the field management of tobacco, continuous struggles were carried out against right-leaning conservative ideas and complacency, so that the management work passed one level after another, and one link was better than another, ensuring high yield and bumper harvest.

	Attacking Three Barriers and Grasping Ten Links
From planting to selling, tobacco has "three barriers" (sowing, management, harvesting) and "ten links" (seedling, land preparation, transplanting, fertilization, watering, pest control, inter-row cultivation and weeding, topping and suckering, harvesting and curing, bundling). The three barriers and ten links are closely connected, and the technology of each link is very high. It will not work if any one of them is not well grasped. Therefore, at the beginning of tobacco production, we proposed: seize one link, watch one link, and then think about one link, and each link must be grasped in a timely manner. In terms of technology, we proposed the management methods of "four changes," "three transformations," and "one elimination" based on emancipating the mind, daring to think and act, combined with visiting, experimenting and researching, and summarizing experience.

The "four changes" are: changing shallow plowing to deep plowing, changing direct seeding to transplanting, changing inferior seeds to improved seeds, and changing sparse planting to dense planting.

The "three transformations" are: changing less fertilization and one-time fertilization to more fertilization and multiple applications; changing no watering to rational irrigation; changing single plants to multiple offspring, multiple grandchildren.

The "one elimination" is: eliminating diseases and insect pests (black shank disease, anthracnose, cutworms, aphids, etc.) to achieve a "four-free" county.

	A Unified Chain from Top to Bottom
Secretaries taking the lead, the whole people taking action, dividing responsibilities, and grasping things to the end. This is the main experience of our county in leading tobacco production. This year, a tobacco high-yield committee has been established throughout the county from top to bottom. The county Party committee appointed a deputy secretary and a member of the county Party committee. Each township assigned a secretary or township head, and the brigade was completely managed by a director, forming a unified chain from top to bottom. The specific operation of tobacco field management was the responsibility of specialized teams. In terms of leadership methods, we adopted "five packages" (county packages township, township packages commune, commune packages team, team packages group, group packages plot) and "six fixes" (technical measures, fertilizers, pesticides, work points, quality, technicians). All 5,624 technicians in the county were responsible from planting to selling. They generally managed to water diligently, topdress frequently, weed diligently, control pests diligently, and sucker diligently. Guo Changhai, a technician from the Ruhe Brigade of the Shiliupu Commune, stayed in the fields from the start of seedling until the end of harvesting and curing. Throughout the county, experimental fields combining cadres, technicians, and the masses were generally established to command production with production. More than 1,100 cadres in the county cultivated 500 mu of experimental fields, with an average yield of over 4,000 jin per mu, which played a demonstrative and promotional role. For example, the experimental fields cultivated by Liu Ximin, deputy secretary of the county Party committee, and Liu Peiwu, secretary of the Shuangmiao Township Party committee, were very outstanding. The masses praised them unanimously: "Secretaries lead secretaries, tobacco creates miracles; from this township to that township, no one can compare; leaves are more than three feet long, tobacco plants are one zhang tall, and a yield of 10,000 jin per mu is indeed guaranteed."

Another experience of ours is: conduct regular inspections and appraisals, and carry out red flag competitions. Based on the tobacco production situation, inspections and appraisals are organized at every stage. From preparing seedbeds last winter to harvesting and curing this year, the county has organized more than ten large-scale visits and appraisals, with more than 5,800 people participating. Through inspections and appraisals, various townships and communes learned from each other's experiences, spread technology, boosted morale, and promoted tobacco field management. The Hongcunsi, Xingmiao, and Xiaohe teams in Yingqiao Township lagged behind in their work, and black flags were planted in tobacco field management. However, because they mobilized all their efforts, they hoisted red flags in the next appraisal.

Third, twist into one rope and organize socialist large-scale cooperation. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, all departments were organized, so that they clarified that the center of the Party's work is their center. As long as tobacco production makes a great leap forward, their business can also make a great leap forward. The commercial departments issued advance deposits for tobacco in unconventional ways, and ensured the supply of various needed materials such as fertilizers and hemp ropes in a timely manner. At the same time, the commercial departments also sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to cooperate, which strongly supported tobacco production. Of course, the strong support of the higher-level Party and government for our county is a particularly important factor in ensuring a good tobacco harvest. For example, the problem of transporting coal for flue-curing was solved with the specific help of the prefectural committee and commissioner's office.

Although our county has achieved great results in flue-cured tobacco production in 1958, there are still many shortcomings: the land was plowed late and not deep enough, the landscaping of individual gardens was not complete, not enough fertilizer was applied, it was not possible to water frequently at the appropriate time, and the degree of dense planting was not enough, so growth was uneven. The highest yield in the "satellite" field reached more than 16,800 jin per mu, while the lowest yield in ordinary fields was only 352 jin per mu. This shows that the potential for increasing tobacco production is still very large. We can completely improve these shortcomings. In order to further improve next year's tobacco yield, 140,000 mu of tobacco land are now being deeply plowed, generally reaching three feet deep, and combined with layered fertilization of 150,000 jin; seedling preparation is also underway, and people from top to bottom have been assigned to be responsible for flue-cured tobacco production.

    烟叶高产庆丰年
    中共襄城人民公社委员会
    具有冲天干劲的襄城人民，在党的领导下，经过1958年的大干、苦干，全县十三万多亩烟，茎高叶大，茂密整齐，棵高平均六尺以上，每棵平均有六十个叶，最高的有三百多个，叶片最大的长三尺二寸，宽二尺二寸。群众对今年烟叶丰收的描绘是：“烟棵高似树，烟叶大如席，烟地像烟垛，打烟搬楼梯。”
      粮烟一齐抓
    我县烟叶所以取得大丰收，并非一帆风顺的。在1957年以前，虽然年年完成了种植面积，但产量不高。县、乡、社个别领导同志对这个问题总是强调客观困难，说什么下雨太多，虫害严重，自然灾害不可抗拒等等。因而对今年的烟叶生产能否大跃进，还存在很多疑虑。一些群众对烟叶在整个国民经济中的重要意义也认识不足。县委为了从根本上扭转局面，组织今年烤烟生产大跃进，在全民整风运动中，自上而下地开展了鸣放辩论，批判了右倾保守思想，从而鼓足了干劲。在2月12日县委召开的乡、社干部整改会议上，县委还提出了：“一手抓粮食，一手抓烟叶，双手一齐抓，粮烟齐跃进”的口号。在烟叶的田间管理过程中，还不断的向右倾保守思想和自满情绪开展了斗争，从而使管理工作中一关胜一关，一环好一环，保证了丰产丰收。
    攻三关抓十环
    烟叶从种到出售有“三关”（种、管、收）“十环”（育苗、整地、移栽、施肥、浇水、治虫、中耕除草、平顶打杈、收烤、扎把）。三关十环紧相连，每个环节的技术性都是很高的，那一个抓不好也不行。因此，我们在烟叶生产一开始就提出：抓住一环，看着一环，再想着一环，一环一环的都要适时抓好。在技术上我们根据解放思想、敢想敢干，结合参观、试验研究、总结经验的方法提出“四改”“三变”“一消灭”的管理办法。
    “四改”是：改浅耕为深翻，改直播为移栽，改劣种为良种，改稀植为密植。
    三变是：变少施肥、一次施肥为多施、分期施；变不浇水为合理灌溉；变独棵为多子、多孙。
    一消灭是：消灭病虫害（黑茎病、炭疽病、土蚕、蚜虫等），实现“四无”县。
      上下一条鞭
    书记挂帅，全民行动，分工包干，一抓到底。这是我县领导烟叶生产的主要经验。今年全县从上到下都建立了烟草丰产委员会。县委确定一个副书记一个县委委员，各乡抽出一个书记或乡长，大队由主任一包到底，上下一条鞭。烟田管理上的具体操作，由专业队负责。在领导方法上采取了“五包”（县包乡、乡包社、社包队、队包组、组包地块）“六定”（技术措施、肥料、农药、工分、质量、技术员）。全县五千六百二十四名技术员，从种到出售都负责到底。他们一般都作到了勤浇水、勤追肥、勤锄草、勤治虫、勤打杈。十里铺分社汝河大队技术员郭长海等从育苗开始，就食宿在田，一直坚持到收烤完。全县普遍建立了干部、技术员、群众三结合的试验田，以生产指挥生产。全县一千一百多干部，共搞试验田五百亩，平均亩产四千斤以上，都起到了示范和推动作用。如县委副书记刘熙民和双庙乡党委书记刘培武等同志搞的试验田十分出色，群众一致赞扬说：“书记带书记，烟叶创奇迹；这乡到那乡，谁也比不上；叶长三尺多，烟棵高一丈，亩产一万斤，的确有保障”。
    我们的另一条经验是：定期检查评比，开展红旗竞赛。根据烟叶的生产情况，在每一环节都组织检查评比。从去冬整理苗床到今年收烤，全县曾组织了大型的参观评比十多次，有五千八百多人参加。各乡、社之间通过检查评比，学习了经验，传播了技术，鼓舞了干劲，推动了烟田管理。颍桥乡洪村寺、邢庙、小河三个队工作落后，烟田管理插上了黑旗。但是由于他们总动员苦干，到下次评比就插上了红旗。
    第三是：扭成一股绳，组织社会主义大协作。在党委的统一领导下，把各部门都组织起来，使他们明确党的工作中心，就是他们的中心，只要烟叶产量大跃进，它们的业务也能够大跃进。商业部门以打破常规的办法发放烟叶预付定金，适时的保证了肥料、麻绳等各种所需物资的供应，同时商业部门还抽大批干部下乡协作，有力的支援了烟叶生产。当然，上级党政对我县的大力支持，是保证烟叶丰收特别重要的一条。如烤烟煤的运输问题，就是在地委、专署具体帮助下解决的。
    1958年烤烟生产，我县虽然获得很大成绩，但还存在有不少缺点：地翻的晚，也不够深，个别的园田化搞的还不完整，肥料施的还不多，没全部做到适时多浇水，密植的程度还不够，因此生长不平衡，产量最高的“卫星”田亩产达到一万六千八百多斤，最低的一般田亩产只有三百五十二斤。这说明烟叶增产的潜力还是很大的。这些不足的地方，我们完全能够改进。为了进一步提高明年烟叶的产量，现在十四万亩烟地正在深翻，普遍达到三尺深，并结合分层施肥十五万斤；育苗准备工作也正在进行，从上到下已确定专人负责烤烟生产。（附图片）
