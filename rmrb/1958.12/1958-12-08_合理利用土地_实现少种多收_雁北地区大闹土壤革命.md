This newspaper Taiyuan, 6th dispatch: Farmers in the Yanbei area of Shanxi Province are vigorously attacking the scientific fortress of soil and launching a soil revolution, laying a solid foundation for further improving soil conditions in the frontier region, rationally utilizing land, and achieving higher yields with less sowing.

Currently, an activity of "the whole Party grasping soil, the whole people learning about soil, everyone understanding soil, and everyone becoming an expert" to vigorously attack the scientific fortress of soil has been widely launched throughout the region. In mid-November, the soil improvement training classes held by the Yanbei Special District and various counties have successively concluded. A group of people's commune cadres and members who had initially mastered soil science knowledge returned to their hometowns and helped their units hold training classes. They quickly imparted the soil science knowledge they had learned to the broad masses of commune members through lectures and on-site visits and internships. At the same time, they discussed with the masses and analyzed and studied the more than ten kinds of soil improvement experiences accumulated over the years, such as "deep plowing of land; layered fertilization; spreading slopes and filling soil to neutralize saline-alkali; crop restructuring and planting according to local conditions; moving soil to suppress sand," and summarized them into pamphlets, organizing farmers to study them in a systematic and orderly manner. Many people's communes have added soil science courses to spare-time schools and red-expert schools, combining them with practical investigation and planning work, so that the broad masses of farmers have begun to arm themselves with scientific and technical knowledge.

Farmers in the Yanbei area, who have initially mastered soil science knowledge, are forming professional teams to carry out soil surveys, planning, and improvement work. By the end of this year, after investigation and research, each county and people's commune will conduct a "physical examination" of all the land, and respectively draw up charts of soil distribution, soil improvement plans, and crop planting according to local conditions, and put forward opinions and specific measures for improvement and rational utilization of different types of soil. In the investigation and planning, it is generally required to proceed from guiding next year's production and combine it with long-term construction.

This year, the farmers in the Yanbei area, after vigorously building water conservancy projects, increasing the application of fertilizer, and implementing intensive farming, overcame various natural disasters. On the preliminary established basic farmland, the total grain output of the entire region increased by 1.64 times compared with last year. However, in summarizing this year's bumper harvest experience and organizing a greater leap forward next year, it was found that the increase in grain production in the entire region was very uneven, and many places had not yet tapped the potential for increasing land production, mainly because the soil was barren and had not been thoroughly improved, which was affected. According to the survey, only 20% of the plains and mountainous areas in the region have better soil quality, while the remaining 80% of the land is loess hills, yellow sandy soil, and saline-alkali low-lying land, which is not suitable for crop growth. Therefore, the Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that launching a vigorous soil revolution and rationally utilizing land are the decisive keys to achieving higher yields with less sowing next year. At the same time, they accepted the lessons of the past when only a few technical cadres contracted, the soil survey, planning, and utilization and improvement work were separated from each other, and the survey results were only written on paper and posted on the wall, which could not be mastered by the masses. It is proposed to "combine indigenous and foreign methods, rely on the masses, and continue to carry out soil surveys, planning, and improvement work in the whole region on the basis of completing deep plowing, and conduct a "physical examination" of all the land, prescribe the right medicine according to different situations, and strive for a greater harvest next year.

### 合理利用土地  实现少种多收  雁北地区大闹土壤革命

    合理利用土地  实现少种多收
    雁北地区大闹土壤革命
    本报太原6日电  山西省雁北地区农民正在猛攻土壤科学堡垒，大闹土壤革命。为进一步改善塞上的土壤条件，合理利用土地，实现少种多收奠定良好基础。
    目前，一个“全党抓土壤、全民学土壤、人人懂土壤、个个当专家”猛攻土壤科学堡垒的活动，已在全区各地普遍展开。11月中旬，雁北专区和各县举办的土壤改良工作训练班已先后结束，一批初步掌握了土壤科学知识的人民公社干部和社员返乡以后，帮助所在单位举办了训练班，通过讲课和现场参观实习，把自己学到的土壤科学知识很快传授给广大社员。同时他们和群众一起商量，把多年来积累的
  “深耕土地；分层施肥；摊坡填土、盐碱中和；作物改组、因地种植；搬土压沙”等十多种改良土壤的经验，经过分析研究，总结起来，编印成册，组织农民有条理、有系统地进行学习。许多人民公社在业余学校、红专学校里，都增设了土壤学课程并结合实际调查、规划工作，使广大农民开始用科学技术知识武装了自己。
    初步掌握了土壤科学知识的雁北区农民，正在纷纷组成专业队伍，着手进行土壤调查、规划和改良工作。到今年年底，各县、人民公社经过调查研究，将对全部土地进行一次“体格检查”分别绘制出土壤分布、土壤改良规划、作物因地种植等图表，针对不同类型的土壤，提出改良和合理利用的意见以及具体措施。调查规划中，一般要求从指导明年生产出发，并和长远建设结合起来进行。
    今年雁北地区农民，经过大力兴修水利，增施肥料，实行精耕细作，战胜各种自然灾害，在初步建立的基本农田上，全区粮食总产量比去年提高了一点六四倍。但是，各地在总结今年丰产经验、组织明年更大跃进中，发现全区粮食的增产很不平衡，许多地方对土地的增产潜力还没有挖掘出来，主要原因是土壤瘠薄，没有得到彻底改良而受到了影响。据调查：全区仅有20％的平原和石山区土质较好，其余80％的土地均系黄土丘陵、黄沙土和盐碱下湿地，不适合农作物的生长。因此，中共雁北地委认为：大闹土壤革命、合理利用土地，是实现明年少种多收的决定关键。同时接受了过去单纯由少数技术干部包办，把土壤调查、规划和利用改良工作互相脱节，调查结果只写在纸上、贴在墙上，不能被群众掌握等教训。提出了“土洋结合、依靠群众，在全区范围内，在完成深翻地的基础上，继续展开土壤调查、规划和改良工作，把全部土地进行一次“体格检查”，针对不同情况，对症下药，争取明年更大丰收。
