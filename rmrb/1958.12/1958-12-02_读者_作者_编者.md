Readers, Authors, and Editors

	Puzzling Title
	The title of an article on the seventh page of your newspaper on November 21, "Want Big, Public, Don't Want Small, Private," is very puzzling. Based on the content of the article, it should probably be "Want Big, Public, Don't Want Small, Private." The omission of a punctuation mark makes it difficult to parse and renders the meaning of the title unclear. Please pay attention to this in the future.

	"Hero Canal" is a Good Article
	The article "Hero Canal" written by Comrade Sun Min, published on the fifth page of the People's Daily on November 16, is a good article describing the communist spirit. The article enthusiastically praises the great spirit of the heroes. In order to build the canal, they overcame all difficulties and shared life and death together. Such noble qualities are worthy of our emulation. The article is also written in a simple and easy-to-understand manner and is full of poetic flavor.

	More Reports on the New Look of People's Communes
	The newsletter "A Day Off in the Commune" on the third page of the People's Daily on November 14 is very good. The newsletter describes how, after a period of hard work, the Yuejin People's Commune in the southern suburbs of Taiyuan City takes a major break. During the holidays, commune members reunite with their families, full of joy, eating comfortably, and having a great time playing basketball, singing, watching movies... The commune stipulates: minor improvements to food every ten days, major improvements every month; usually everyone sleeps eight hours, and there are three days of vacation every month. This fully demonstrates how happy the lives of the masses are after the establishment of the commune.
	I think this newsletter is of great significance. I hope to see more reports on the new look of people's communes to broaden the horizons of readers and commune members.

	Provides Profound Inspiration
	I was deeply moved after reading "In the Same Party Group with Chairman," written by He Dequan and published on the eighth page of the People's Daily on November 13. Our great leader Chairman Mao conducts his daily organizational life entirely as an ordinary party member. Although He Dequan cooks for Chairman Mao, he is Chairman Mao's party group leader, and Chairman Mao must report his work to him, and seriously say: "There is no high or low within the Party, all are party members. You are the group leader, so you are my leader." Some comrades are unwilling to lead a strict organizational life; they should learn from Chairman Mao's example.

	Happy to Read "Blood of Siblings"
	"Blood of Siblings," written by Korean Comrade Li Yuzi and published on the eighth page of the People's Daily on the 24th of this month, is a very good article. I read it several times in a row. I and the comrades around me were deeply moved by the brotherly and sisterly feelings of the Chinese and Korean people sharing life and death and going through thick and thin together. Today, as Premier Kim Il-sung leads the Korean government delegation to visit our country, reading such an article further reinforces how precious this friendship forged in blood is!

	Learn Their Style
	The news published on the second page of the People's Daily on November 21 about the emergence of a new communist spirit in the Jianhua, Qinghua, and other factories greatly encouraged me and many comrades around me. The workers and comrades of these three factories have promoted the communist style, established the ideology of mutual cooperation and selflessness, and implemented a mass self-management system in all aspects, giving us profound inspiration. Our party branch secretary read this report to the cadres at the workshop meeting, and our principal also focused on introducing the advanced deeds of the Jianhua and other three factories when conducting communist ideological education for all teachers and students. We are determined to learn their style.

    费解的标题
    你报11月21日第七版上有篇文章的题目是“要大、公不要小、私”这个题目很费解。根据文章的内容来看，恐怕是“要大、公，不要小、私”。遗漏了一个标点，就很难断句，使题目含意不明，请你们今后注意。

    “英雄渠”是好文章
    11月16日人民日报五版登载的孙民同志写的一篇文章——“英雄渠”，这是一篇描写共产主义风格的好文章。文中热情地歌颂了英雄们的伟大气魄。他们为了修渠，排除万难、生死与共，这样高贵的品质，值得我们学习。文章写得也通俗易懂，富有诗意。

    多报道人民公社新气象
    人民日报11月14日第三版上“公社的休假日”这篇通讯很好。通讯写的是太原市南郊跃进人民公社苦战一段时间之后就来个大歇工，假日里，社员们全家团聚，喜气洋洋，吃得舒服，玩得也痛快，打篮球、唱歌、看电影……。公社里规定：伙食十天小改善，一月大改善；平常大家睡眠八小时，一个月还要放三天假。这充分显示了成立公社以后，群众的生活多么幸福。
    我认为这篇通讯意义很大。希望多报道人民公社的新气象，来扩大读者和社员们的眼界。

    给人深刻的启发
    读了11月13日人民日报第八版刊登的何德全写的“和主席在一个党小组”，我深受感动。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在日常的组织生活中，完全以一个普通的党员自居。何德全虽然是给毛主席作饭的，但他是毛主席的党小组长，毛主席就要向他汇报工作，而且严肃地说：“党内没有高低之分，都是党员。你是小组长，就是我的领导。”现在有些同志不愿过严格的组织生活，他们应该好好学习毛主席的榜样。

    喜读“姊弟血”
    本月24日人民日报第八版刊登了朝鲜同志李玉子写的“姊弟血”，这是一篇很好的文章。我一连读了好几遍。我和我周围的同志为中朝人民同生死共患难的手足之情深深感动。今天，当金日成首相率领朝鲜政府代表团来我国访问期间，读到这样的文章，更进一步体会到这种鲜血凝成的友谊，是多么值得珍贵！

    学习他们的风格
    人民日报11月21日第二版发表的建华、庆华等工厂出现了共产主义新风气的消息，我和周围很多同志看了受到很大鼓舞。这三个工厂工人同志发扬共产主义风格，树立互相协作舍己为人的思想，并实行了各方面的群众自我管理制度，给我们深刻的启发。我们的党支书在车间会议上给干部们朗读了这篇报道，我们的校长对全校师生进行共产主义思想教育时，也着重介绍了建华等三个工厂的先进事迹。我们决心学习他们的风格。
