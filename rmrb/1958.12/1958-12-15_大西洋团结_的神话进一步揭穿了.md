The myth of "Atlantic Solidarity" Further Exposed
Xi Linsheng

On December 16, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will hold another council meeting of all fifteen nations in Paris. This is exactly one year after the summit of North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries held in Paris in mid-December last year. Last year's Paris meeting was fraught with chaos and contradictions, and now a series of open conflicts and quarrels have erupted within this aggressive military alliance. These conflicts and quarrels are deepening the division of the alliance and further exposing the myth of "Atlantic solidarity."

America's "Leadership Crisis"

The biggest change within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc in the past year has been the fact that the United States, as the "leader" of the group, has seen its leadership and control greatly shaken. The launch of three Soviet artificial satellites and the new situation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind have made America's "leadership crisis" in the Western world increasingly obvious. Seeing the dangerous consequences of following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war, movements against establishing American missile bases, demanding East-West negotiations, and establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe have sprung up all over the world, especially in Western Europe. In addition, the serious impact of the American economic crisis on the capitalist world has further aggravated the centrifugal tendencies within the North Atlantic Group. This centrifugal tendency was clearly manifested at the North Atlantic Group Foreign Ministers meeting held in Copenhagen in May this year. Unlike the Paris meeting in December last year, the cries for establishing American missile bases and manufacturing nuclear arms divisions of labor were replaced by the United States being forced to discuss great power talks and disarmament issues. Despite Dulles' best efforts to bury the demands for great power talks and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and the United States government even issued a special statement before the meeting rejecting the Polish government's proposal for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, many national representatives at the meeting still expressed their "hope to convene a high-level meeting in the near future," and the plan for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe was still discussed twice. The meeting also discussed the "economic problems" related to the impact of the American economic crisis and the competition for markets against the will of the United States. Even more noteworthy is that the final communiqué of the meeting also mentioned that countries "cooperate closely without abandoning their independent policies." This is the first time in history that the word "independence" has appeared in the meeting communiqué of this group, while the United States has repeatedly stated that it wants to replace "independence" with "collective security."

After the Copenhagen meeting, the United States' armed aggression in the Middle East and military provocations in the Taiwan Strait region further isolated the United States unprecedentedly. The actions of the US and Britain in refusing French intervention and sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan without consulting with "allies" caused widespread dissatisfaction within the North Atlantic Group. France openly broke with the US and Britain. West Germany, which is known as the "most loyal ally" of the United States, "has remained silent and has not given any support to the US and Britain" ("New York Times"). They even joined Italy in constantly complaining to the US and Britain. Later, under pressure from the United States, West Germany and Italy reluctantly expressed their support for the US and British aggressive actions, but in fact, they engaged in two-faced activities. When the United States created tension in the Taiwan Strait region, the United States was in an even more miserable situation. Member states of the North Atlantic Alliance, even Britain, refused to "assume obligations" at the critical juncture of American aggression and adventure. In this way, the United States, under the condemnation of world public opinion, fell into a predicament on all sides.

The disgraceful failure of the United States to carry out aggression in the Middle East and Taiwan Strait region further exposed the paper tiger nature of the United States, causing it to lose face once again in the Western world. The struggle among "allies" for leadership has become increasingly obvious and acute. First, French Prime Minister de Gaulle wrote to the heads of the United States and Britain requesting the establishment of a US-British-French "troika core" to determine the policies of the North Atlantic Group, throwing a bomb at "Atlantic solidarity." West Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Nordic countries also took the opportunity to clamor for strengthening "political consultations" within the group, that is, opposing the United States' arbitrary actions. Shortly thereafter, an open quarrel broke out even in the "core" of the US and Britain. On October 24, British Field Marshal Montgomery, the retired Deputy Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces of the North Atlantic Group, delivered a speech severely criticizing the United States, complaining that Britain should not have handed over leadership to the United States after the war, and even believing that the military committee of the North Atlantic Group should not be located in Washington but in Paris, and that the American general currently serving as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces should be replaced. Immediately, challenges from the "allies" came to the United States all at once. General Norstad, the American general serving as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, immediately came out and made a tit-for-tat statement, opposing the removal of the North Atlantic Military Committee from Washington. He bluntly said that representatives of various countries should be allowed to approach the United States Department of Defense, and that the United States Department of Defense is the "military nerve center of the most powerful member" of the North Atlantic Group. He also turned around and accused "certain criticisms" of the North Atlantic Group of being "rash and frivolous." This series of fierce contradictions and struggles between the United States' strengthening of control and its "allies'" opposition to control is accelerating the rotting process of the North Atlantic Group like a festering sore.

The Battle for the Second "Leader"

As the contradictions between the countries of the North Atlantic Group and the United States deepened, the struggle among Western European countries, especially Britain and West Germany, for the position of the second "leader" became increasingly fierce. As the British "Observer" pointed out: "In Western Europe, long-term competition has been going on for almost ten years... The question is: who will become the main power and the source of decisive influence in Western Europe - Britain or West Germany?"

At the end of last year, the British government took advantage of the "leadership crisis" in the United States, put forward the slogan of so-called "interdependence," and took some leadership from the United States, making Britain play the role of "watchdog guarding the European flock." However, Britain's position was immediately opposed by its powerful rival, West Germany. At that time, West Germany united France and Italy to form a Western European "continental front" to confront the US-British alliance. Aiming at the attempt of Britain and the United States to monopolize the nuclear weapons of the North Atlantic Group, West Germany, France, and Italy formed a three-nation arms alliance to prepare to manufacture atomic weapons themselves. Soon after, Britain hurriedly sent Defense Minister Sandys to Bonn, wanting to reach some kind of compromise to allow Britain to squeeze in. Although West Germany later stated that it could engage in arms cooperation with Britain, it insisted that the three-nation arms alliance should not be abolished. In addition, West Germany also tried its best to use the contradictions between other member states of the North Atlantic Group and Britain to attract some countries to strengthen its position against Britain. A successful example in this regard is the organization of the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries. This market completely excluded Britain and allowed West Germany to take the lead. West Germany also used the contradictions caused by de Gaulle's request to establish a US-British-French "troika core," on the one hand, secretly sabotaging the establishment of the "troika core," and on the other hand, wooing France to confront the US and Britain. Recently, when Britain was at odds with Greece over the Cyprus issue and was severely attacked, Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis went to Bonn to "seek" Adenauer's support. As expected, Greece received a "aid" of more than 70 million US dollars from West Germany. This cannot but be an encouragement to Greece's "fighting spirit" against Britain. Facts have shown that West Germany has already taken advantage of Britain in the competition for leadership in Western Europe.

Of course, West Germany is not satisfied with this. It knows that to compete with Britain, it must quickly catch up in terms of military strength. Originally, West Germany proposed to arm the West German army with atomic weapons, which was aimed at the so-called "white paper on disarmament" put forward by Britain last year. At that time, Britain wanted to reduce conventional military equipment and replace it with expanding nuclear military equipment. West Germany immediately came out and said: Since Britain wants to engage in nuclear weapons on a large scale, West Germany should not be an exception. Now, with the help of the United States, the West German defense force will soon have atomic weapons and missiles. Moreover, there is news that the United States and West Germany are preparing to abolish the provisions of the Paris Agreement regarding restrictions on West Germany's manufacture of new weapons, allowing West Germany to manufacture missiles and submarines. The growth of West Germany's military strength has made its expansion ambitions increasingly large. Recently, it openly demanded that the troops in southern Denmark and Norway, which were originally under the command of the Nordic Command of the North Atlantic Group, be handed over to the Central European Command led by West German generals, attempting to seize control of Central Europe and Northern Europe. For this matter, the Danish representative and the West German Minister of Defense even had a big fight at the North Atlantic Group Parliamentary Meeting.

The United States tried its best to take advantage of the infighting between Britain and West Germany. The United States knew that Britain and West Germany could not help but turn to it in the competition for the second "leader," so it established a US-British "two-headed core" on the one hand, and on the other hand, it did not relax the establishment of an "axis" with the West German militarist forces it had fostered, in order to suppress Britain and other Western European countries.

In this intricate battle for the second "leader," a de Gaulle has now intervened. This regime, which represents French fascists and colonial forces, on the one hand, strives to maintain its colonial empire, and on the other hand, attempts to seize the opportunity to expand in order to reorganize the position of the French Empire. De Gaulle's efforts to manufacture atomic bombs himself, to squeeze into the ranks of atomic powers, and to demand the establishment of a "troika core" and to be on an equal footing with the US and Britain are manifestations of this. However, to achieve this goal, France still lacks capital in terms of economy, politics, and military affairs. It has to rely on the strength of other countries. On the Western European continent, Britain opposes de Gaulle becoming a strong country and is desperately using France's predicament to squeeze out French forces in North Africa together with the United States. Although West Germany also opposes France's expansion of its power, West Germany and France have a common foundation in the current struggle mainly against the US and Britain. France also uses this foundation to rely on the strength of West Germany to confront the US and Britain. Therefore, in the recent period, the contradictions between France and West Germany have eased somewhat, and de Gaulle even went abroad to West Germany to hold talks with Adenauer for the first time since he came to power. He also made some concessions to West Germany on the "Common Market" issue, etc. However, it is very clear that de Gaulle's current reliance on West Germany is only temporary. Once he has the strength, he will also compete with West Germany for hegemony in Europe. Therefore, de Gaulle's "comeback" competition has further intensified the contradictions between imperialism.

A Life-and-Death Struggle

In addition to political and military contradictions and struggles, the conflict of economic interests among the countries of the North Atlantic Group has also deepened the rift between the Atlantic "allies." Due to the strength of the socialist camp and the rise of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America over the past year, as well as the development of the economic crisis in capitalist countries, the economic conflicts between imperialist countries competing for markets and investment scope have also become increasingly fierce. In the past, there have been disputes between Britain and West Germany over occupation expenses, competition for military orders, etc., and now on the issue of the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area," West Germany, France, and Britain have launched an economic war that Western newspapers call a comprehensive "split" "in commerce, politics, and military affairs."

The struggle between the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area" is actually a struggle between West Germany, France, and Britain for economic and political dominance in Western Europe. The "Common Market" excludes British competition and guarantees the monopoly capital of the six countries of West Germany, France, Italy, etc., to monopolize the Western European market. Among them, due to West Germany's strong economic strength, West German monopoly capital will be able to occupy a dominant position in this market. Although the United States did not appear on the front stage in this struggle, it supported the activities of the "Common Market" behind the scenes, attempting to weaken Britain's strength and expand the export of capital and commodities through the "Common Market." The United States' behind-the-scenes activities have further increased the complexity of this struggle.

The "Common Market" is obviously a serious threat to Britain. It will not only be in danger of being driven out of this market, which accommodates one-seventh of British exports, but also will face dual competition from West Germany and the United States. Therefore, Britain has united the remaining countries that are not members of the "Common Market" and proposed the establishment of a "Free Trade Area" to replace the "Common Market" plan. Britain's plan is to maintain the Western European market while not abandoning its imperial preferential system with Commonwealth countries, and to use the preferential system to expand into the Western European market. France strongly opposed this plan of the United States, because according to Britain's method, the benefits of France's participation in the "Common Market" will not only be in vain, but also France is in danger of losing the Western European market due to British competition. For West Germany, the "Free Trade Area" is not without its benefits. West Germany relies on its economic strength and is not afraid of competing with Britain. With the establishment of a "Free Trade Area," West Germany can not only dominate "Little Europe" as before, but also can enter the sphere of influence of the British Commonwealth. However, at present, given France's opposition, the "Free Trade Area" is not as stable as the "Common Market," and West Germany can also use France's opposition to force Britain to make some concessions. Therefore, West Germany is currently playing the role of a "mediator," attempting to profit from it.

Since the "Common Market" will officially open on January 1 next year, the contradictions and struggles between the two sides are becoming increasingly urgent and fierce. After countless tense negotiations, the two sides still cannot coordinate their interests. This makes Britain extremely angry. British officials and newspapers have continuously attacked and threatened the "Common Market" countries, and even said that they would take retaliatory measures at the cost of economic division in Western Europe. Although the "Common Market" countries recently agreed to temporarily extend the six countries' reduction of tariffs and relaxation of import quotas to other member states of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau." However, this lip service and insincere temporary compromise did not satisfy Britain. There is news that Britain feels "very disappointed" with this concession, and its attitude has also become tougher. British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd have personally come forward to bluntly threaten that if the tradition of trusted cooperation in the economic field is broken, the tradition of cooperation in the military and political fields cannot be "preserved intact." Now the British ruling group is not just talking about it. On the eve of the North Atlantic Group Council, the British government is insidiously using the Berlin situation to bargain with West Germany on the issue of Western European trade, attempting to force it to submit. It seems that this is a powerful card for Britain to deal with West Germany. There is news these days that West Germany is considering whether to "make some concessions" on the "Free Trade Area" issue. But the problem is that if West Germany makes a concession, it will cause dissatisfaction in France, which will make the contradictions between West Germany and France, as well as Britain and France, tense again.

It has been almost ten years since the establishment of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Contrary to the close unity and prosperity of the socialist camp, it is in a paralyzed predicament with haze on all sides and suffering from various diseases. This situation reflects the increasingly deepening contradictions in the imperialist camp, thereby completely bankrupting the myth of "North Atlantic solidarity" and is moving towards disintegration.

This is the sad situation facing the upcoming North Atlantic Group Council. (Attached picture)

    “大西洋团结”的神话进一步揭穿了
    席林生
    12月16日，北大西洋集团又要在巴黎举行全体十五国的理事会会议了。这跟去年12月中旬在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团各国首脑会议正好时隔一年。去年的巴黎会议曾出现了一片混乱和矛盾，现在这个侵略性的军事联盟内部更爆发了一连串的公开的冲突和争吵。这些冲突和争吵加深着联盟的分裂，进一步揭穿了“大西洋团结”的神话。
    美国的“领导危机”
    一年来，北大西洋侵略集团内部最大的一个变化，就是作为“盟主”的美国对这个集团的领导和控制已经大大动摇了。苏联三颗人造卫星的上天，东风压倒西风的新形势，使美国对西方世界的“领导危机”趋于表面化。由于看到跟随美国扩军备战的危险后果，世界各处，特别是西欧各国掀起了反对建立美国导弹基地、要求东西方谈判和建立中欧无原子武器区的运动，加上美国经济危机对资本主义世界造成的严重影响，进一步加剧了北大西洋集团内部离心倾向。这种离心倾向明显地表现在今年5月在哥本哈根召开的北大西洋集团外长会议上。这次会议和去年12月的巴黎会议不同，代替建立美国导弹基地、制造核军备分工等等的叫嚷的，是美国被迫讨论大国会谈和裁军问题。尽管杜勒斯百般企图埋葬大国会谈和建立中欧无原子武器区的要求，美国政府甚至特别在会前发表声明拒绝波兰政府的中欧无原子武器区的建议，但是在会议上许多国家代表还是表示“希望在最近将来召开高级会议”，并且对中欧无原子武器区的计划仍然进行了两次讨论。会议还违背美国的意愿讨论了有关美国经济危机的影响和争夺市场的“经济问题”。而更值得注意的是，会议最后公报还提到各国“密切合作而又不放弃自己的独立的政策”。这是历史上第一次在这个集团的会议公报中出现“独立”的字样，而美国是口口声声要以“集体安全”来取代“独立”的。
    哥本哈根会议之后，美国武装侵略中东和在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅，更使美国陷于空前孤立的境地。美英拒绝法国插足，又未跟“盟国”商量而出兵黎巴嫩和约旦的行动，在北大西洋集团内部引起了普遍的不满。法国公开地同美英闹起别扭来。称为美国“最忠实的盟友”的西德则“一直保持沉默，不给予美英任何支持”（“纽约时报”），它们甚至同意大利在一起不断向美英发出怨言。之后，在美国的压力下，西德、意大利虽然半心半意地表示支持美英的侵略行动，但是实际上却又大搞两面活动。当美国在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的时候，美国的处境那就更惨了。北大西洋联盟的成员国，甚至连英国都拒绝在美国侵略冒险的危急关头“承担义务”。这样，美国在全世界舆论的谴责下，陷入了四面楚歌的困境。
    美国在中东和台湾海峡地区进行侵略的可耻失败，进一步暴露了它的纸老虎的原形，使它再一次在西方世界中失尽威风。“盟国”争夺领导权的斗争随之趋于表面化和尖锐化。先是法国总理戴高乐写信给美英两国首脑要求建立美英法“三巨头核心”来决定北大西洋集团的政策，给“大西洋团结”投了一颗炸弹。西德、意大利、加拿大和北欧各国也乘机重新叫嚷要加强集团内的“政治磋商”，即反对美国独断独行。接着不久，在美英的“核心”中间也爆发了公开的争吵。10月24日英国元帅、已退职的北大西洋集团盟军最高副司令蒙哥马利发表了一篇严厉抨击美国的演说，埋怨战后英国不应该把领导权交给美国，甚至认为北大西洋集团的军事委员会不应当设在华盛顿而应当设在巴黎，并且应当更换现在担任盟军最高司令的美国将军。顿时，“盟国”的挑战一齐向美国袭来。担任盟军最高司令的美国将军诺斯塔德马上出来发表针锋相对的谈话，反对把北大西洋军事委员会搬出华盛顿。他露骨地说，应当让各国代表接近美国国防部，而美国国防部是北大西洋集团“最强大的成员的军事神经中枢”。他还反过来指责对北大西洋集团的“某些批评”是“轻率和轻浮的”。这一系列美国加强控制和其“盟国”反控制的激烈的矛盾和斗争，像溃烂的脓疮一样地在加速着北大西洋集团的腐烂过程。
    第二号“盟主”的争夺战
    随着北大西洋集团各国同美国的矛盾的加深，西欧各国特别是英国、西德之间争夺第二号“盟主”地位的斗争也越来越激烈。正像英国“观察家报”所指出的：“在西欧，长期的竞争已经差不多继续十年了……问题是：谁将在西欧成为主要的大国和有决定性影响的根源——是英国呢，还是西德呢？”
    去年年底英国政府乘着美国发生“领导危机”的当口，提出了所谓“互相依赖”的口号，从美国手里拿到了一部分领导权，使英国担任了“守护欧洲畜群的警犬的角色”。但是英国这种地位立即受到有势力的劲敌西德的反对。当时西德联合了法国和意大利组成了西欧“大陆阵线”来同美英联盟相对抗。针对英国和美国垄断北大西洋集团核武器的企图，西德、法国和意大利又组成了三国军备同盟，准备自制原子武器。不久之后，英国急急忙忙派国防大臣桑迪斯奔赴波恩，想取得某种妥协，让英国挤进去。虽然后来西德表示可以跟英国搞军火合作，但是却坚持三国军备同盟不得废除。此外，西德还竭力利用北大西洋集团其他成员国和英国的矛盾，把一些国家吸引过来，以加强它同英国对抗的地位。在这方面的一个成功的例子，是组织西欧六国的“共同市场”。这个市场完全把英国排除在外而让西德独占鳌头。西德并利用戴高乐要求建立美英法“三巨头核心”所引起的矛盾，一面暗中破坏“三巨头核心”的建立，一面拉拢法国来对抗美英。最近，当英国为了塞浦路斯问题和希腊闹得不可开交，受到严厉攻击的时候，希腊首相卡拉曼利斯却到波恩去“寻求”阿登纳的支持。果然希腊得到了西德给予的一笔七千多万美元的“援助”。这对于希腊对英国的“斗志”不能不是一种鼓励。事实表明，在争夺西欧领导权方面，西德已经比英国占着优势了。
    当然，西德并不以此为满足，它深知要同英国匹敌，还必须在军事力量方面急起直追。原来西德提出要以原子武器武装西德军队，就是针对去年英国提出的所谓“裁军白皮书”的。当时英国想裁减常规军备而代之以扩充核军备。西德马上出来表示：既然英国要大搞核武器，西德也不能例外。现在在美国的帮助之下，西德国防军很快将拥有原子武器和导弹了。而且有消息说，美国和西德正准备废除巴黎协定关于限制西德制造新武器的规定，让西德制造导弹和潜水艇。西德军事力量的增长使它的扩张野心也越来越大。最近它公开要求把原来归北大西洋集团北欧司令部指挥的在丹麦和挪威南部的军队交给由西德将军领导的中欧司令部指挥，企图把中欧和北欧抓在自己的手里。为了这件事，丹麦代表和西德国防部长在北大西洋集团议员会议上还大闹了一场。
    美国对于英国和西德的斗法竭力加以利用。美国知道英国同西德要争夺第二号“盟主”还不能不求助于它，因而便一方面建立起美英“两巨头核心”，而另一方面又不放松与它一手扶植的西德军国主义势力建立“轴心”，以压制英国同其他西欧国家。
    在这纵横捭阖的第二号“盟主”的争夺战中，现在又插进了一个戴高乐来了。这个代表法国法西斯和殖民势力的政权，一方面力图保持它的殖民帝国，另一方面又企图伺机进行扩张，以此来重整法兰西帝国的地位。戴高乐竭力要自制原子弹，挤入原子大国行列以及要求建立“三巨头核心”和美英平起平坐，就是这方面的表现。但是，要达到这个目的法国无论在经济上、政治上、军事上都还缺乏本钱。它不得不需要借助其他国家的力量。在西欧大陆上，英国是反对戴高乐成为强国的，而且还拚命和美国一起利用法国的困境在北非排挤法国的势力。而西德虽然也反对法国扩张势力，但是在目前主要反对美英的斗争中西德和法国却有着共同的基础。法国也就利用这个基础，依靠西德的力量来对抗美英。因此，最近一个时期来，法国和西德之间的矛盾比较缓和了一下，戴高乐甚至在他上台后还第一次出国到西德去和阿登纳进行会谈。在“共同市场”问题上也向西德做了某些让步等等。不过，很显然戴高乐目前对西德的依靠只是暂时的，当他一旦有力量之后，他也会同西德争夺欧洲的霸权。因此，戴高乐“东山再起”的竞争，使帝国主义之间的矛盾进一步加剧起来。
    你死我活的斗争
    除了政治和军事上的矛盾和斗争之外，北大西洋集团各国之间的经济利益上的冲突也更加深了大西洋“盟国”间的裂痕。由于社会主义阵营的强大和一年来亚、非和拉丁美洲民族解放运动的高涨，以及资本主义国家经济危机的发展，使得帝国主义国家争夺市场和投资范围的经济冲突也进一步白热化。过去曾经有过英国和西德关于占领费用的争吵、军事定货的争夺等等，而现在在“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的问题上，西德、法国和英国之间更展开了一场西方报刊称之为“在商业上、政治上和军事上”全面“分裂”的经济战。
    “共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的斗争，实际上是西德、法国和英国争夺西欧经济和政治上的支配权的斗争。“共同市场”排除英国的竞争，保证了西德、法国、意大利等六国垄断资本对西欧市场的独占。其中由于西德雄厚的经济实力，将使西德垄断资本得以在这个市场上居于优势地位。美国虽然在这场斗争中没有正面出场，但是它却在幕后支持“共同市场”的活动，企图借以削弱英国的势力，并通过“共同市场”来扩大资本和商品的输出。美国的幕后活动更增加了这一斗争的复杂性。
    “共同市场”对于英国显然是个严重的威胁。它不仅将有被逐出这个容纳英国输出七分之一的市场的危险，而且将会面临西德和美国的双重竞争。因此，英国就联合起其余非“共同市场”成员国的国家，提出建立“自由贸易区”来代替“共同市场”的计划。英国的计划，是想保持西欧市场，同时又不放弃它同英联邦国家的帝国优惠制，并且利用优惠制来向西欧市场扩张。法国对美国的这一打算予以激烈反对，因为照英国的办法，法国参加“共同市场”的好处不仅将化为乌有，而且由于英国的竞争，法国还有丧失西欧市场的危险。对西德来说，“自由贸易区”并不是没有好处的。西德依靠它的经济实力并不怕和英国竞争。建立了“自由贸易区”，西德不仅照样可以称霸“小欧洲”，而且还能打入英联邦的势力范围。不过目前鉴于法国的反对态度，“自由贸易区”不及“共同市场”稳当，而且西德也还可利用法国的反对来迫使英国再作出一些让步。因此，目前西德充当的是一个“调和者”的角色，企图从中渔利。
    由于“共同市场”将在明年1月1日正式开张。因此目前两方面的矛盾和斗争也越来越紧迫而激烈了。双方经过无数次紧张的谈判，还是无法协调彼此的利益。这使英国极为恼怒，英国官方和报纸连续对“共同市场”国家进行攻击和威胁，甚至说要采取不惜使西欧经济上分裂的报复性措施。虽然最近“共同市场”国家同意暂时把六国降低关税和放宽进口定额推广到“欧洲经济合作局”的其他成员国。但是这个口惠而实不至的临时性妥协，并没有使英国满足。有消息说，英国对这种让步感到“非常失望”，而且态度也变得强硬起来。英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德都亲自出场，露骨地威胁说：如果经济方面的信任的合作传统被打破的话，军事政治方面的合作传统也不能够“完整无缺的保存下去”。现在英国统治集团并不是说说就算，正当北大西洋集团理事会的前夕，英国政府正在阴险地利用柏林局势跟西德在西欧贸易问题上讨价还价，企图迫使它就范。看来这是英国对付西德的一张有力的牌。这几天有消息说，西德正在考虑是否在“自由贸易区”问题上“作一些让步”。但是问题是西德一让步就会引起法国的不满，从而使西德和法国、以及英、法矛盾又紧张起来。
    北大西洋侵略集团成立以来快十年了。它同社会主义阵营紧密团结、欣欣向荣的情况相反，正处于阴霾四伏、百病俱发的瘫痪困境。这种局势反映了帝国主义阵营的矛盾日益加深，从而使“北大西洋团结”的神话完全破产，并且正在走向破裂。
    这就是即将召开的北大西洋集团理事会所面临的可悲的形势。（附图片）
