    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, December 17th: The nationwide discussion of the draft outline of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy has been underway for nearly a month. This nationwide discussion, which fully promotes socialist democracy, is the third nationwide discussion following the previous nationwide discussions on the reorganization of industrial management and the reorganization of tractor stations. At the same time, this nationwide discussion is larger in scale and involves a wider range of issues than the previous two.
    This nationwide discussion was widely launched throughout the country after the publication of Khrushchev's report outline on "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965" on November 14. At present, the discussion has shifted from the initial mass general discussion stage to the in-depth discussion and summary of discussion opinions at party congresses and activists' meetings held in various states and cities. Workers, peasants, scientists, economists, party and government cadres, students, and soldiers participated in the discussion. This discussion strengthened the Party's ideological and political work.
    The Soviet people spoke very enthusiastically during the discussion, unanimously and warmly endorsing the draft outline of the Seven-Year Plan. In Moscow alone, 700,000 people participated in the discussion in half a month, and more than 30,000 people put forward suggestions. Central, republican, and local newspapers have dedicated special pages to publishing discussion articles from various regions every day.
    During the discussion, although people expressed a wide range of opinions, they generally focused on these aspects: the significance of the Seven-Year Plan and its feasibility; the high-speed development of the national economy under the Seven-Year Plan and its guarantees; the balance of regional development and development ratios in economic development; the importance of vigorously developing the eastern regions; further development of science and technology; and the Seven-Year Plan and the improvement of people's lives. The discussion unanimously agreed that this great program of communist construction, the Seven-Year Plan, is based on a realistic foundation. With the correct leadership of the Party, the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and the Soviet Union's strong material and technological foundation, this grand plan will surely be realized. Moreover, people generally believe that the basic guarantee for the realization of the Seven-Year Plan is the further improvement of labor productivity achieved through technological innovation, the overall automation of production, and mechanization. Popov, secretary of the Leningrad Municipal Party Committee, and Alakelyan, Doctor of Economics, and others wrote articles stating that the realization of the Seven-Year Plan and high-speed production increases will be achieved by continuously improving productivity through technological reforms. They pointed out that in the past few years, some large-scale factories in the ferrous metallurgy industry will be fully automated, such as the Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, Dzerzhinsky factories, and the Nizhny Tagil United Enterprise. This measure alone can produce an additional 880,000 tons of pig iron, 1.15 million tons of steel, and 9.3 million tons of steel products per year. The investment in automation reconstruction can be fully recovered within two years. Leningrad will have 23 factories, 190 separate workshops, and 18 transportation workshops completely transformed into mechanized and automated ones. The Donbass will also rebuild 230 mines to increase their productivity by 75%. In the next seven years, due to technological innovation, overall automation of production, and mechanization, industrial labor productivity will increase by 45%-50% per worker, the construction industry will increase by 60%-65%, and collective farm labor productivity will double.
    The discussion pointed out that vigorously developing the eastern region is completely correct. Scientists have made many explanations about the third iron and steel base to be established there. Professor Probst, Doctor of Economics, pointed out that the metallurgical industry in the eastern region is different from the metallurgical industry in the European part of the Soviet Union. It will use electric furnaces with cheap electricity, so the cost is low and the quality is good.
    In recent days, party and government leaders of various republics have published articles and participated in the discussion. They elaborated on the development prospects of various republics in the Seven-Year Plan. Some regions and enterprises put forward opinions on the issue of balanced development during the discussion. For example, Bao Ludulin, chief engineer of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant, pointed out that the production of steel and steel products in this factory is extremely unbalanced. He said that the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the factory will increase pig iron production by 42%, coke by 52%, and ore by 52%, but the stipulated increase in steel and steel products is only 12%. Therefore, he suggested changing this unbalanced development situation, building steelmaking furnaces, and ensuring that the increase in steel and steel products reaches 42%. Amazaspyan, chairman of the "Zhdanov" Collective Farm in Armenia, suggested that in order to develop farm production and fully utilize farm products, the farm should run various factories on its own.
    People also unanimously pointed out in the discussion that the Seven-Year Plan stipulates further development of light industry and daily necessities industry, as well as shortening working hours and increasing people's income, which is another proof of the Party's infinite concern for the people.
    With the widespread development of the nationwide discussion, the labor enthusiasm of the people in various regions has become even higher. People in various regions have universally combined with the production situation of their own units, put forward many rationalization proposals, increased production tasks, and launched production competitions. For example, the nationally renowned Mamai work team of the Donbass Coal Mine stipulates that in 1959, each team member will over fulfill the plan by two and a half tons of coal per shift and reduce costs by one ruble and fifty kopecks. The Korizhik work team in the area responded to this competition and proposed to over fulfill the plan by three tons of coal per person per shift and reduce costs by two rubles. Workers at the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant want to produce an additional 5,000 tons of pig iron, 6,000 tons of steel, and 4,000 tons of steel products before the end of the year. Many production teams in Moscow's "Red Proletarian" factory, "Ilyich" factory, Sanshan Textile Factory, Moscow Rubber Factory, and factories in Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sverdlovsk, Baku, Kharkov, and other places have proposed to complete the Seven-Year Plan in a shorter time. At the same time, the production increase movement is also being carried out in rural areas. Collective farm members in Latvia guarantee to produce 640 to 650 kilograms of milk and 58 to 60 kilograms of meat per capita this year, which will greatly exceed the United States. The chairman of the "Lenin" Collective Farm in the Kuban region said that through discussion, all collective farm members have greatly improved their production enthusiasm and proposed to produce 130 quintals of meat and 300 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land in 1959, which is double the increase compared to this year.
    A noteworthy new phenomenon has also emerged in this nationwide discussion: the organization of communist labor work teams. This is the beginning of a communist labor competition movement based on the high degree of consciousness of the working people. It is of great significance for completing the Seven-Year Plan and building communism. At present, this movement is being widely carried out in various economic zones, and the working people in various regions are working hard to create conditions and strive to obtain the title of communist labor work team.
    The nationwide discussion of the draft outline of the Seven-Year Plan is still unfolding in depth. At the same time, various regions are also concentrating and summarizing the opinions put forward in the discussion, preparing to submit them to the 21st Congress of the CPSU to be held on January 27 next year for final discussion.

    伟大纲领鼓舞共产主义建设者劳动热情
    苏联全民满怀信心保证实现七年计划
    各地展开广泛深入讨论纷纷提出合理化建议
    本报莫斯科17日电  苏联发展国民经济七年计划提纲的全民讨论已近一月。这次充分发扬了社会主义民主的全民讨论，是继以往工业管理改组与拖拉机站改组全民讨论后的第三次全民大讨论。同时这次全民讨论比过去的两次规模更大，涉及的问题更广泛。
    这次全民讨论是在11月14日公布了赫鲁晓夫关于“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”报告提纲后，在全国范围内广泛地开展起来的。目前讨论已由开初群众性的一般大会讨论阶段，转入了各地州、市举行党代会、积极分子会议深入讨论和总结讨论意见的阶段。参加讨论的有工人、庄员、科学家、经济学家、党政机关干部、学生、部队。这次讨论，加强了党的思想政治工作。
    苏联人民在讨论中发言非常踊跃，一致热烈拥护七年计划提纲。仅莫斯科市，在半个月的时间内就有七十万人参加了讨论；三万多人提出了建议。中央、共和国和地方报刊都辟有专页每天刊载来自各地的讨论文章。
    在讨论中，虽然人们发表的意见非常广泛，但大体上集中于这些方面：七年计划的意义与其实现的可能性；七年计划国民经济的高速度发展及其保证；经济发展中的地区与发展比例的平衡；大力开发东部地区的重要性；进一步发展科学技术以及七年计划与人民生活提高等问题。讨论中一致认为，这个伟大的共产主义建设纲领性的七年计划，是立足在现实基础上的，有党的正确领导、广大群众的积极性和苏联强大的物质技术基础，这个宏伟计划一定能够实现。而且人们普遍认为，七年计划实现的基本保证，是通过技术革新、生产全盘自动化、机械化而达到的劳动生产率的进一步提高。列宁格勒市委书记波波夫、经济学博士阿拉开梁等人著文说，实现七年计划与高速度增产将依靠技术改革后生产率不断提高而取得。他们指出，在最近几年内，仅黑色冶金业方面就有一些规模巨大的工厂要生产全部自动化，如马格尼托哥尔斯克、库兹涅茨、捷尔任斯基工厂和下塔吉尔联合企业，仅这一措施，一年能多生产生铁八十八万吨，钢一百十五万吨，钢材九百三十万吨，而用在自动化改建方面的投资，在两年之内全部可以收回。列宁格勒将有二十三个工厂、一百九十个单独车间、十八个运输车间全部改建成机械化、自动化的。顿巴斯也将改建二百三十个矿井使其生产率提高75％。在今后七年内，由于技术革新、生产全盘自动化和机械化，因此以每个劳动力计算，工业劳动生产率将提高45％—50％、建筑业提高60％—65％、集体农庄劳动生产率将提高一倍。
    讨论中指出大力开发东部地区是完全正确的。科学家们对将在那里建立的第三钢铁基地作了不少说明。经济学博士普罗布斯特教授指出，东部地区的冶金工业与苏联欧洲部分的冶金工业不同，那里将采用廉价电力的电炉，因此成本低质量好。
    这些天来，各共和国党政领导人纷纷发表文章，参加讨论。他们阐述了各共和国在七年计划中的发展远景。有些地区与企业单位，在讨论时对平衡发展问题提出了意见。如库兹涅茨钢铁厂总工程师包罗都林指出，这个工厂钢和钢材的生产极平不衡。他说，七年计划中规定工厂增产生铁42％，焦炭52％，矿砂52％，但是钢与钢材规定只增产12％。因此他建议改变这种发展不平衡的情况，修建炼钢炉，保证钢与钢材的增产达到42％。亚美尼亚的“日丹诺夫”集体农庄主席阿玛札斯普扬建议，为了发展农庄生产和充分利用农庄产品，由农庄自办各种工厂。
    人们在讨论中还一致指出，七年计划中规定进一步发展轻工业与日用品工业，以及缩短工时，提高人民收入，这是党对人民无限关怀的又一证明。
    随着全民讨论的广泛展开，各地劳动人民生产热情更加高涨。各地劳动人民都普遍地结合本单位生产情况，提出许多合理化建议，增加生产任务，开展生产竞赛。如全国闻名的顿巴斯煤矿马马依工作队，规定在1959年每个队员每班要超计划增产二吨半煤，减低成本一卢布五十戈比。而该地科里吉克工作队响应这一竞赛，提出每人每班超计划增产煤三吨，减低成本二卢布。库兹涅茨钢铁厂工人要在年底前增产生铁五千吨、钢六千吨、钢材四千吨。莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂、“依里奇”工厂、三山纺织厂、莫斯科橡胶厂，以及列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、巴库、哈尔科夫等地工厂的许多生产队，都提出要以更短的时间来完成七年计划。同时，增产运动也在各地农村中开展着。拉脱维亚农庄庄员保证今年按人口计算生产牛奶六百四十至六百五十公斤，肉类五十八至六十公斤，要大大超过美国。库班地区的“列宁”集体农庄主席说，全体庄员通过讨论大大提高了生产积极性，提出在1959年每一百公顷农业用地上产肉类一百三十公担，牛奶三百公担，比今年增产一倍。
    在这次全民讨论中还出现了值得注意的新现象：组织共产主义劳动工作队。这是建筑在劳动人民高度自觉基础上的共产主义劳动竞赛运动的开端。它对完成七年计划、建设共产主义具有重大意义。目前，这个运动正在各经济区普遍展开，各地劳动人民正在努力创造条件，争取获得共产主义劳动工作队的称号。
    七年计划提纲的全民大讨论还在深入展开中，同时各地也在集中和归纳讨论中提出的意见，准备提交明年1月27日召开的苏共第二十一次代表大会作最后讨论。（附图片）
