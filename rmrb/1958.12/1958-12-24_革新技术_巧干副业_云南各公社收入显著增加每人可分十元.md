    Technological Innovation, Skillful Sideline Production
    Significant Increase in Income for Yunnan Communes, Each Person Can Receive Ten Yuan
    According to Xinhua News Agency, people's communes across Yunnan Province, based on the needs of the communes, the state, and the market, are actively restoring and developing various sideline productions in accordance with local conditions. Currently, the number of people engaged in sideline production throughout the province accounts for more than 15% of the total labor force. In the past month alone, communes in various regions have earned more than 110 million yuan from the sale of agricultural and sideline products. Based on the current production situation, it is generally estimated that each person in a commune can earn an average of ten to fifteen yuan by the Spring Festival.
    Sideline production in various parts of Yunnan began to expand widely in November. In carrying out this work, all regions, through calculating labor accounts, arranged a certain amount of labor to engage in sideline production while vigorously engaging in winter wheat field management, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, various regions also emphasized that sideline production should also be done "skillfully," universally promoting and popularizing technological innovation and improved tools to increase work efficiency. After the Yuejin Commune in Yuxi County changed the old method of manually pounding brick clay to mechanical earth brick pressing, work efficiency increased twofold. The Dongfeng Commune in Weishan Yi Autonomous County adopted methods such as chutes to slide gypsum and alum ore down the mountains, saving a large amount of manpower and animal power.
    In carrying out sideline production, many people's communes have adopted a combination of collective commune management and individual member management to develop sidelines. Counties such as Lufeng have assigned sideline production involving state plans, large labor costs, large scale, and high output value to the commune for unified arrangement and unified management. All those that are conducive to decentralized management, locally sourced materials, and labor-saving are managed by the management area or production team according to different conditions to give play to the enthusiasm of the management area and production team. Without hindering collective production, members are also allowed to engage in sideline occupations suitable for individual or family operation, such as raising chickens, raising ducks, and making straw sandals. Some communes have also established covenants to abide by national price policies and not to engage in speculation as sideline production.
    When formulating plans for sideline production this winter and next spring, various communes, due to adopting the method of jointly discussing and studying with commercial departments and signing contracts, are generally able to develop sideline industries according to needs and possibilities, distinguishing between priorities and emergencies. At the same time, the products produced can be quickly sold. For example, the twelve people's communes in Zhaotong County, according to the current purchasing varieties planned by the commercial department, seized the season to collect more than 7 million catties of tung seeds, peppercorns, and varnish seeds, all of which have been purchased by the commercial department. Commercial departments in various regions not only help communes formulate production plans, but also help communes find sideline avenues, impart technology, and open up sales channels.

    革新技术  巧干副业
    云南各公社收入显著增加每人可分十元
    据新华社讯  云南各地人民公社根据公社、国家和市场的需要，因地制宜积极恢复和开展各种副业生产。目前，全省投入副业生产的人数已占劳动力总数的15％强。在最近的一个月中，各地公社已从出售农副产品中收入一亿一千多万元。根据当前生产情况，一般公社到春节时平均每人可以收入十至十五元。
    云南各地的副业生产从11月开始广泛展开。在开展这一工作时，各地都通过算劳力账的办法，在大搞小春田间管理、修水利和积肥的同时，安排一定的劳动力投入副业生产。同时，各地还强调副业生产也要“巧干”，普遍提倡和推广技术革新和改良工具，以提高工效。玉溪县跃进公社改老法人工掼砖泥为土机械压砖泥后，提高工效两倍；巍山彝族自治县东风公社采取溜槽等办法，把山上的石膏和明矾矿石滑运下山，节约了大批人力和畜力。
    在开展副业生产中，许多人民公社采取公社集体办和社员个人办相结合的办法发展副业。禄丰等县将涉及国家计划和劳力费工较多、规模较大和产值大的副业生产，划归公社统一安排，统一经营；凡是有利于分散经营、就地取材和节省劳动力的，根据不同条件由管理区或生产队经营，以发挥管理区和生产队的积极性。在不妨碍集体生产的情况下，又让社员经营宜于个人或家庭经营的养鸡、养鸭、打草鞋等副业。有些公社并且订立了服从国家价格政策和不得以贩卖事业作为副业生产的公约。
    各公社在制订今冬明春副业生产规划时，由于采取了与商业部门共同讨论研究及订立合同的办法，因此，一般都能按照需要和可能，分清轻重缓急发展副业，同时生产出来的产品很快能够销售出去。例如昭通县的十二个人民公社，按照商业部门当前收购品种的计划，抓紧季节采集了七百多万斤桐子、花椒、漆子，已全部由商业部门收购。各地商业部门不仅帮助公社制订生产规划，还帮助公社寻找副业门路、传授技术和开辟销路。
