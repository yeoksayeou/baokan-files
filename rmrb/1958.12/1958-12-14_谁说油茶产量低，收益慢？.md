Who Says Oil-Tea Camellia Has Low Yield and Slow Returns?
	Xie Yuanxiao

For a long time, many people have believed that oil-tea camellia only produces a few jin or a dozen jin of oil per mu, which is not very profitable; they also believe that newly planted oil-tea camellia forests take seven or eight years to bear fruit, which is too slow to address immediate needs. In short, they say: low yield, slow returns. Thus, labels such as "low-yield oil crop" and "minor oil crop" have been placed on oil-tea camellia. These views are not entirely consistent with the facts. Now, let the facts speak for themselves.

This year, national oil-tea camellia production, like the herbaceous oil crops peanuts and rapeseed, has experienced an unprecedented bumper harvest. Examples of yields of one or two thousand jin of oil per mu are no longer isolated cases. Moreover, many large-scale high-yield examples have emerged. In Gezhuping Commune, Xupu County, Hunan Province, 1,250 mu of oil-tea camellia averaged 252 jin of oil per mu. In Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, the county's more than 120,000 mu of oil-tea camellia forests exceeded the 100-jin mark for tea oil per mu. In Hunan Province, the 10 million mu of oil-tea camellia forests have already yielded more than 30 jin of oil per mu. These high-yield results eloquently demonstrate that oil-tea camellia is not only not a low-yield oil crop, but should also be ranked among the top oil crops. Therefore, we should change our view of oil-tea camellia and remove the "low-yield" label.

Oil-tea camellia is a woody oil crop, and naturally its growth is not as fast as herbaceous oil crops that can be planted in spring and harvested in autumn. However, based on the current situation, as long as some measures are taken, it can grow very quickly and fully meet the requirements for rapid high yields. Rao Mingfeng, a technician at the Xinlian Commune Oil-Tea Camellia Farm in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, planted oil-tea camellia by direct seeding last winter, and it has already budded and will be harvested next year. In the former Huaxin Agricultural Cooperative in Heyuan County, Guangdong Province, ten mu of oil-tea camellia planted in 1952 flowered and bore fruit in the third year after planting, and yielded 63.6 jin of tea oil per mu in the fifth year. The productive period can be advanced by using cuttings for propagation. This shows that developing oil-tea camellia is not a matter of "distant water." If some advanced measures are added, a bumper harvest can be achieved quickly.

The ability of oil-tea camellia forests to achieve high yields and the rapid high yields of newly planted young forests are of great significance for solving the country's current edible oil problem. The country originally had more than 33 million mu of oil-tea camellia forests. Based on the large-scale high yields appearing in various regions this year and the current situation of the masses in the producing areas vigorously engaging in oil-tea camellia technological innovation, it is entirely possible for the original forests to reach a yield of 200 jin or more of oil per mu within two or three years. In this way, tea oil alone can solve the edible oil problem for one-third of the country's population.

Oil-tea camellia has a wide range of adaptability and distribution. It can be harvested for many years after one planting, and it requires little investment but yields high returns, and has high output. It can provide oil, and its shells are important industrial raw materials, so it should be vigorously developed. The main problems currently existing in oil-tea camellia production are that management is generally still very extensive, and abandoned and semi-abandoned oil-tea camellia still account for one-fifth of the total oil-tea camellia area. This is the biggest obstacle to increasing production. Without breaking through this barrier, increasing production and achieving a bumper harvest will inevitably become empty talk. Therefore, we must vigorously carry out reclamation and strengthen management. We must carefully cultivate, achieve horticultural management, terrace the forest land, apply more fertilizer, and loosen the soil frequently to create conditions for increasing production and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of oil-tea camellia.

    谁说油茶产量低，收益慢？
    谢源孝
    长时期以来，很多人认为油茶每亩产油不过几斤或者十几斤，油水不大；还认为新造的油茶林要七八年才结果，远水解不了近渴。总之一句话，就是：产量低，收益慢。于是，“低产油料作物”“小油料”这样一些名词便落到油茶头上。这些看法是与事实有出入的。现在应该让事实来说说。
    今年，全国油茶生产也同草本油料作物的花生、油菜一样出现了空前未有的丰收。亩产一、二千斤油的例子已不是个别的。而且还出现了许多大面积丰产典型。湖南溆浦县戈竹坪公社一千二百五十亩油茶，平均亩产油二百五十二斤。浙江常山县全县十二万多亩油茶林亩产茶油突破百斤大关。湖南全省一千万亩油茶林，已经收到的茶果就超过了亩产油三十斤的水平。这些丰产结果，都雄辩地说明油茶非但不是低产的油料作物，而且在油料作物中，还应该名列前茅。因此应该改变对油茶的看法，摘掉“低产”帽子。
    油茶是木本油料作物，论生长当然比不上草本油料作物能春种秋收，但是从现在情况看来，只要采取一些措施，长的也非常快，完全能够达到快速丰产的要求。湖南衡山县新县社油茶林场技术员饶鸣凤在去冬直播的油茶，今年就着了花蕾，明年就有收获。广东省河源县原华新农业社1952年种植的十亩油茶，种后第三年就开花结果，第五年亩产茶油六十三斤六两。采用插条繁殖，盛产期还可以提早。由此可见发展油茶并不是“远水”。要是加上一些先进的措施，还可以很快地取得丰收。
    油茶成林能够高额丰产，新造幼林能够快速丰产，这对于解决国家当前食油问题有着十分重要的意义。全国原有油茶林三千三百多万亩，根据今年各地出现大面积丰产和目前产区群众大搞油茶技术革新运动的情况来看，原有成林在两三年之内达到亩产油二百斤或者更多一点是完全可能的。这样仅茶油一项，就可以解决全国三分之一人口的食油问题。
    油茶的适应性较大，分布很广。一次种植多年收获，而且投资少，收益大，产量高，既可以取得油料，其果壳又是重要的工业原料，应该大力发展。当前油茶生产上存在的主要问题是经营管理一般还很粗放，并且荒芜和半荒芜的油茶仍占到油茶总面积的五分之一。这是提高产量的最大障碍。不突破这一关，增产、丰收，必然成为空谈。因此，要大力进行垦复和加强经营管理。要精心培育，作到管理园艺化，林地梯田化，多施肥，勤松土，为增产创造条件，争取油茶全面大丰收。
