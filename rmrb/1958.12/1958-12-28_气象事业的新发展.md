    New Developments in Meteorological Work
    Tu Changwang, Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau

    Since the beginning of this year, China's meteorological work has made a leap forward. As of the end of November, according to incomplete statistics: there are 202 meteorological observatories, 2,399 meteorological (weather) stations, 28,762 newly built weather outposts, and 453,745 weather-watching groups nationwide. There are even more meteorological liaisons, with tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands in one province alone; Henan province alone has more than 500,000. The situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture across the country has brought about a high tide in the leap forward of meteorological work, and the mass technical revolution movement has promoted inventions and creations in meteorological work. The urgent desire of the broad masses, especially the peasant masses, to understand, master, and conquer nature has promoted the great development of meteorological work.

    This year, two main measures have promoted the advancement of meteorological work. One is the decentralization of the meteorological work system, handing over the leadership of meteorological work to Party committees at all levels; the other is entrusting meteorological science to the masses, combining the scientific research of technical personnel with the practice of the broad masses. Once these two measures were implemented, a lively new situation emerged in China's meteorological work. From then on, meteorological work jumped out of the circle of dogmatism and transformed into a meteorological undertaking run by the entire Party and all the people, becoming a socialist meteorological undertaking suitable for China's specific conditions. This is a fundamental transformation, carried out under the leadership of the Party.

    Only by entrusting meteorological science to the entire Party and all the people can we clarify the direction, gain the support of the masses, and give China's meteorological undertaking a unique style. This style is concentratedly manifested in the following two major events. One is the formation of a dense meteorological service network throughout the country; the other is the widespread implementation of single-station supplementary forecasts throughout the country.

    The standard for forming a national meteorological service network is: a station in each special zone, a station in each county, a weather outpost in each township (people's commune), a weather-watching group in each community (production team), and the ability to provide services in conjunction with agricultural production; at the same time, conduct widespread and in-depth publicity to achieve a state where everyone understands meteorology and everyone uses meteorology. Currently, provinces and cities such as Henan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Guangdong, Gansu, Shanghai, and Hubei have formed meteorological service networks, and other provinces and regions may complete this in the coming winter and spring. Through it, meteorological work can be closely integrated with production tasks. At present, weather forecasts are available in rural areas, cities, factories, shops, parks, and cinemas. People use signal flags of various colors, as well as weather billboards, meteorological lights, and other different signs to indicate weather changes. Shandong province alone has 140,000 sets of signal flags, averaging one set per square kilometer. In this way, weather forecasts are transmitted to every grassroots production unit, basically achieving household knowledge and universal awareness.

    Supplementary correction forecasts are an original creation of China's meteorological work. It was first created by the Zhenxiong Climate Station in Yunnan. The working method is: the climate station, based on the weather forecast of the meteorological observatory covering a wide area, combines the local weather characteristics and the farmers' weather-watching experience to make a supplementary weather forecast suitable for the county. Some meteorological outposts and weather-watching groups use the same method to make weather forecasts for their own townships and teams. After weather forecasts are supplemented and corrected layer by layer, the accuracy rate has been greatly improved, generally above 90%. For example, the weather-watching group in Gaohan Township, Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, issued 14 forecasts from July 13th to August 15th based on listening to the forecasts of the forecasting station and meteorological station, with 100% accuracy each time. Among them, four times there were contradictions with the forecasts of the meteorological station, but it was proved afterwards that the weather-watching group's forecasts were correct. Farmers' forecasts are not only highly accurate but also closely integrated with production. For example, the meteorological outpost of Guangwu No. 1 Cooperative in Henan Province conducted detailed investigations in the fields every five days based on temperature changes. Upon discovering that insects had begun to breed, they sprayed a large amount of "666" and other pesticides, and as a result, insect pests were greatly reduced.

    In this way, not only meteorological observatories can make forecasts, but also the vast meteorological stations, weather outposts, and weather-watching groups can make forecasts, breaking the superstition that only meteorological observatories can make forecasts in the world.

    With such a dense meteorological service network and such accurate forecasts closely linked to production, we will naturally receive the support of the entire Party and all the people. Guangxi farmers sing: "The meteorological observatory foresees the future, the news of wind and rain is transmitted down, sowing, harvesting, and drying are well arranged, how can we forget the grain returning home." This folk song represents the feelings of the broad masses of peasants.

    We believe that as long as we adhere to relying on Party committees, put politics in command, break superstitions, and follow the mass line, China's meteorological work will be able to catch up with or surpass all capitalist countries in artificial control of local weather, medium and long-term weather forecasting, observation and instrument quality and technology within a few years.

    气象事业的新发展
    中央气象局局长  涂长望
    今年以来，我国气象事业有了飞跃的发展。到11月底为止，据不完全统计：全国现有气象台二百零二个；气象（候）站二千三百九十九个；新建气象哨二万八千七百六十二个；看天小组四十五万三千七百四十五个。气象联络员就更多了，一省就有几万、十几万甚至几十万，仅河南一省就五十多万。全国工农业大跃进的形势，带来了气象事业跃进的高潮，群众性的技术革命运动促进了气象工作的发明创造。广大群众特别是农民群众要求了解、掌握、战胜自然的迫切愿望，促进了气象事业的大发展。
    今年，有两个主要措施，推动了气象事业的前进。一个是气象工作体制下放，把气象工作的领导权交给各级党委；一个是把气象科学交给群众来办，使技术人员的科学研究和广大群众的实践相结合。这两条措施一经贯彻，就使我国气象工作出现了一种生动活泼的新局面。从此，气象工作跳出了教条主义的圈子，变成为全党全民办气象事业，变成为适合我国具体情况的社会主义气象事业。这是一个根本的转变，这种转变，是在党的领导下进行的。
    气象科学交给全党全民来办，才能明确方向，才有群众的拥护，才能使我国的气象事业有独创的风格。这种风格，集中的表现在以下两件大事上。一件是：在全国组成星罗棋布的气象服务网；一件是：在全国普遍开展单站补充预报。
    组成全国气象服务网的标准是：专区有台、县县有站、乡乡（人民公社）有哨、社社（队队）有看天小组，并能结合农业生产进行服务；同时普遍深入地开展宣传，达到人人懂气象，人人用气象。现在，已有河南、云南、广西、山东、黑龙江、贵州、广东、甘肃、上海、湖北等省市组成了气象服务网，其他省区也可能在今冬明春完成。通过它可使气象工作和生产任务紧密结合。目前，无论在农村、城市、工厂、商店、公园、电影院，都有天气预报。人们用各种不同颜色的信号旗，以及天气广告牌、气象灯等不同标志，来表明天气的变化。仅山东一省就有十四万套信号旗，平均一平方公里一套。这样，就把天气预报传到了每个基层生产单位，基本上达到了家喻户晓，人人皆知。
    补充订正预报是我国气象工作的独创。它首先是由云南镇雄气候站创造的。这种工作方法是：气候站在气象台预报大范围天气的基础上，结合地方性的天气特点和农民的看天经验，作出适合本县的补充天气预报。有些气象哨和看天小组用同样的办法做出本乡本队的天气预报。天气预报经过层层补充订正之后，准确率有了很大的提高，一般的均在90％以上。如云南省玉溪县高含乡看天小组，在收听预报台及气象站的预报基础上自7月13日到8月15日发布预报十四次，每次都百分之百的准确。其中四次与气象站的预报有矛盾，但事后证明，看天小组的预报是正确的。农民的预报不仅准确率高，而且能密切结合生产，如河南省广武一社气象哨根据气温变化情况，每隔五天到田间详细调查一次，发现有虫开始繁殖，就大量喷射“六六六”等药品，结果虫害大为减轻。
    这样，不仅气象台能做预报，而且广大的气象站、气象哨、看天小组也能做预报，打破了世界上只有气象台能做预报的迷信。
    有了这样稠密的气象服务网，有了这样准确的密切结合生产的预报，自然就会得到全党全民的支持，广西农民唱道：“未卜先知气象台，风雨消息传下来，播种收晒安排好，粮粒还家怎忘怀。”这首歌谣代表了广大农民的心情。
    我们相信，只要坚持依靠党委，政治挂帅，破除迷信，走群众路线，我国的气象工作一定能在几年之内，在人工控制局部天气、中长期天气预报、观测与仪器的质量和技术的主要方面，赶上或超过一切资本主义国家。（附图片）
