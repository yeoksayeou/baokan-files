    Map of Japan (Tanka)
    By Watanabe Junzo
    I stand
  on the soil of my homeland.
  Roar, land!
  The homeland is betrayed...
  "Independence" is just a name,
  how long
  will our people be enslaved?!
  Japanese islands!
  Japanese maps!
  Everywhere, the marks of airports and naval ports.
  From Hokkaido to Kyushu,
  everywhere is the dragonfly shape of airport markings.
  Ah! Whose country's airport is this?
    Is this really my homeland?!
  Transformed into U.S. military bases,
  the defiled map of Japan,
  I wish I could tear it to shreds!
  Standing on
  the road rolled over by tank treads,
  my heart aches.
  The tread marks stretch into the distance...
  Ravaged land,
  is Japanese soil! The homeland's skin!
  Even on New Year's cards, I must write—
    "If the homeland is not liberated,
  I will not die in peace!"
  Wife, children,
  live on, be sure to welcome
  a New Year's Day
    when we can say "Happy New Year!" from the bottom of our hearts.
  Footsteps grow louder and louder...
  Roars shake the heavens and the earth,
  shaking the whole of Japan!
    —I, too, am in this ranks.
      [Translated by Qu Mai, illustrations by Ying Tao]

    [Translator's Note] The above tanka are selected and translated from Watanabe Junzo's tanka collection "Map of Japan." These tanka reflect the Japanese people's desire to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," break free from American control, and strive for national independence.
    The Japanese tanka, also known as waka, is a widely circulated literary form among the Japanese people. Those skilled at writing tanka are called kajin (tanka poets). Watanabe Junzo is a famous Japanese kajin. He is currently a central committee member of the "New Japan Kajin Association" and the "New Japan Literature Society," and the editor-in-chief of the "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper's tanka column. He has boldly innovated in both the content and form of tanka: its characteristic lies in its content being rich in revolutionary thought; in terms of form, it has been changed from two-line writing to three lines, and it promotes the use of popular and easy-to-understand words and sentences.

    日本的地图（短歌）
    日本  渡边顺三我脚踏着祖国的大地。
  怒吼吧，大地！
  祖国被出卖了……
  “独立”只是虚名，
  我们的民族
  要被奴役到几时？！日本四岛啊！日本的地图啊！到处都是机场、军港的标记。从北海道到九州，无处不是蜻蜓形的机场标记。啊！这是哪一国的飞机场？
    难道这就是我的祖国？！
  变成美国军事基地
  被沾污了的日本地图，
  我恨不得把它撕毁！伫立在
  战车履带滚过的道上，
  我，心如刀割。履带的痕迹伸向远处……
  被蹂躏的大地呵，
  是日本的土地！祖国的皮肤！贺年片上也要写上——
    “祖国不解放，
  死也不瞑目！”
  妻子呵，孩子呵，
  活下去，一定要迎接：
  打心底里能说声“恭贺新禧！”
    的元旦。
  脚步声越来越高……
  怒吼声震天撼地，
  震撼着整个日本！
    ——我，也在这行列里。
      〔瞿麦译，英韬插图〕
    〔译者附记〕上面几首短歌，选译自渡边顺三的短歌集“日本的地图”。这几首短歌，反映出日本人民要求废除日美“安全条约”、摆脱美国的控制和争取民族独立的心愿。
    日本的短歌，亦称和歌，是日本民族中流传很广的一种文学形式。擅长写短歌的，被称为歌人。渡边顺三是日本著名的歌人。现任“新日本歌人协会”及“新日本文学会”中央委员、“赤旗报”短歌专栏主编。他在短歌的内容及形式方面都进行了大胆的革新：其特点在于内容富于革命思想；形式上从二行书写改为三行，用词造句提倡通俗易懂。
