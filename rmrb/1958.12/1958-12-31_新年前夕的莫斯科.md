    1958 is about to pass in the cheers of the Soviet people for the Seven-Year Plan. The Soviet people are excitedly seeing the significant achievements made in communist construction over the past year and are welcoming the New Year with excitement.

    In Moscow on New Year's Eve, there is a festive atmosphere everywhere. Many store windows have already displayed New Year's fir trees, various toys, and colorful small electric lights for festive decoration. They attract not only children but also slow down the pace of passing adults.

    "Children's World" is particularly lively these days. At its entrance, a giant "Grandfather Frost" waves frequently to customers, wishing them a Happy New Year. In the center of the hall, a New Year's fir tree as tall as twelve meters exudes the fragrance of the fields. The sales of goods in this department store have doubled compared to usual these days. The general manager of the department store, Serbakot, told our reporter that in order to ensure that the citizens have a good New Year, the three thousand two hundred staff members of "Children's World" have voluntarily canceled their holidays and extended their business hours. A competition to become a "Communist Labor Team" has also been launched among young salespeople. Excellent salesperson Duliskaia said that the department store now has to receive nearly two million customers, and the daily task of the salespeople is to ensure that they all buy satisfactory items.

    Currently, primary and secondary schools in Moscow have started their winter vacations. Various clubs and cinemas have organized various pre-New Year entertainment activities for primary school students. The Lenin Central Stadium organized a grand New Year program, the "Friendship Fir Tree Festival." This Fir Tree Festival started on December 28 this year and will continue until January 18 next year. Children here can not only see the Russian troika and familiar heroes often read about in fairy tales, but also see performances by many famous Soviet circus performers. There are also twenty or thirty kinds of animals participating in the performance here.

    From the morning of January 1st, the Moscow Kremlin will be open exclusively for children. Starting from January 5th, a New Year's Eve celebration for young people will also be held here.

    新年前夕的莫斯科
    新华社记者  崔永昌
    1958年在苏联人民欢呼七年计划的声浪中就要过去了。苏联人民兴奋地看到了一年来在共产主义建设中所取得的重大成绩，并且怀着兴奋的心情迎接新年的来临。
    在新年前夕的莫斯科，到处是一片节日气象。许多商店的橱窗中已经摆出了迎接新年的枞树、各种各样的玩具和五颜六色的供节日装饰用的小电灯。它们不但吸引了儿童，而且也减慢了路过的成年人的脚步。
    “儿童世界”这几天特别热闹。在它的入口处，一个巨大的“严寒老人”向顾客频频招手，预祝他们新年快乐。在大厅中央，高达十二公尺的新年枞树发散着田野的芳香。这几天来这家百货公司销售的货物比平常增加了一倍。百货公司的总经理谢尔巴科特向本社记者说，为了保证市民过好年节，“儿童世界”的三千二百个工作人员自动取消了休假日，并且延长了营业时间。青年售货员中还展开了争取成为“共产主义劳动队”的竞赛。优秀售货员杜丽斯卡雅说，现在百货公司要接纳将近二百万顾客，每天售货员的任务就是使他们全买到称心的物品。
    目前，莫斯科中小学已经开始放寒假。各俱乐部和电影院都为小学生组织了年前各种娱乐活动。列宁中央运动场组织了盛大的新年节目“友谊枞树节”。这个枞树节从今年12月28日开始，一直继续到明年1月18日。儿童们在这里不但可以看到在童话中经常读到的俄罗斯三轮马车和大家熟悉的英雄人物，而且可以看到苏联许多著名马戏演员表演的节目。在这里参加演出的还有二、三十种动物。
    从1月1日早晨起，莫斯科克里姆林宫将开始专门为儿童开放。从1月5日开始，这里还将举办青年新年大联欢。
