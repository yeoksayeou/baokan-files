Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 13th. The All-African People's Conference held its closing session today amidst enthusiastic singing of "Give me that old-time freedom spirit" and "Victory awaits us in the struggle in Africa."

The conference read out three resolutions. Other resolutions will be distributed after the meeting.

The resolution on colonialism and imperialism stated: First, the conference, attended by more than 300 delegates representing over 200 million Africans, strongly condemns colonialism and imperialism, in whatever form these scourges exist.

Second, the political and economic exploitation of Africa by European imperialists must cease immediately.

Third, the use of African manpower by imperialists in various malicious schemes of power politics should become a thing of the past.

Fourth, independent African states should, in their international policies, adhere to principles that promote and accelerate the independence and sovereignty of all African dependencies and colonies.

Fifth, all African men and women should be granted basic human rights, and the rights of African local residents to fully utilize their land should be respected and protected.

Sixth, universal suffrage should be granted to all people, regardless of race or gender.

Seventh, independent African states should guarantee basic human rights and universal suffrage for all.

Eighth, the conference shall establish a permanent secretariat to organize the All-African People's Conference on a solid foundation.

Ninth, the conference shall establish a human rights commission to investigate complaints of human rights violations throughout Africa and take appropriate measures to ensure that everyone enjoys various rights.

Tenth, the conference declares its support for all African freedom fighters, for all those who use peaceful means such as non-violence and non-cooperation, and also for all those who, in places where retaliation is necessary, have to retaliate against violence in order to win national independence and freedom for the people. The conference condemns all laws that consider those who fight for independence and freedom as common criminals.

The resolution on the establishment of a permanent body stated that the meeting firmly decided to launch a final offensive against the practices of depriving African people of their freedom, rights, and basic human rights, and decided to establish a permanent secretariat in Accra. The aims and objectives of the secretariat are as follows:

I. To promote mutual understanding and solidarity among the peoples of African countries;

II. To accelerate the liberation of Africa from imperialism and colonialism;

III. To mobilize world public opinion against the practice of depriving Africans of their political rights and basic human rights;

IV. To cultivate a sense of family among the peoples of African countries, so as to facilitate the future emergence of the United States of Africa.

The third resolution demanded that colonial countries withdraw from the territories they occupy and hand over sovereignty to African democratic governments elected by universal suffrage.

The chairman of the conference, Mboya, announced before the closing of the conference that the Tunisian government had invited the next All-African People's Conference to be held in Tunis.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 13th. The chairman of the All-African People's Conference, Mboya, said in his closing remarks at the closing session today, "Africa is at the beginning of a new era, it is moving from the darkness and humiliation of colonialism ruled by a few foreigners, to a period when it is recognized as a force in the world." He said that despite differences in language and ancestry, and despite their first meeting, the delegates had found a basis for unity, and the resolutions for the liberation of Africa were drafted on this basis.

Mboya said that African freedom fighters "do not lean towards the East, nor do they lean towards the West. We are only committed to forming the characteristics of Africa."

He said that the convening of the All-African People's Conference was not for propaganda and empty talk, but for action. He said that the establishment of a permanent body was to coordinate and guide action. He said that the resolution passed by the meeting on the Algerian issue called for action to achieve an immediate and peaceful solution to the problem. On the South African issue, the conference supported the non-cooperation movement of the South African people. Active action will be taken on this issue, and the possibility of implementing economic boycotts against South Africa is being considered.

When talking about the Angolan issue, Mboya accused the Portuguese colonialists of setting up an iron curtain there. He said, however, that Angola is not an indivisible part of Portugal; the people of African countries will give the people of Angola material and other support.

Mboya said, "We believe in non-violent action," but this is not "passive," it means "active action." He said that whether people have to use violence depends on the attitude of imperialism. If they are forced to take violence, it is a retaliatory action.

Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah spoke at the meeting after Mboya, emphasizing the importance of unity among the peoples of African countries. He said that the root cause of Africa's weakness lies in disunity. He called on the representatives to organize a broad united front against imperialism and colonialism after returning to their countries.

He said that now, Africa is determined to gain freedom, and no force in the world can stop it. He said that the permanent body of the conference should implement the resolutions passed by the conference.

He also talked about African character, the African Federation, and "Pan-African Socialism." (Attached picture)

    新华社阿克拉13日电  全非人民大会今天在“给予我那种原有的自由精神”和“在非洲的斗争中胜利等待着我们”的热情歌声中举行闭幕会议。
    大会共宣读了三项决议。其他决议将在会后分发。
    关于殖民主义和帝国主义问题的决议说：第一、由代表两亿多非洲人的三百多位代表参加的大会，强烈谴责殖民主义和帝国主义，不论这些祸害以什么形式存在。
    第二、欧洲的帝国主义分子对非洲的政治和经济剥削应当立即停止。
    第三、帝国主义者在各种强权政治的恶毒计划中使用非洲人力的情况应当成为过去。
    第四、独立的非洲国家应当在它们的国际政策中，奉行能够促进和加速一切非洲附属国和殖民地的独立和主权的原则。
    第五、应该使所有的非洲男女获得基本的人权，非洲当地居民充分利用他们的土地的权利应当受到尊重和维护。
    第六、应当使所有的人、不问种族或性别，享有普选权。

    第八、大会设立常设秘书处，以便在巩固的基础上组织全非人民大会。
    第九、大会设立人权委员会以研究非洲各地侵犯人权的控诉，并采取适当措施以保证人人享受各种权利。
    第十、大会宣布支持非洲所有争取自由的战士，支持所有采用非暴力和不合作等和平手段的人们，也支持在那些必要进行报复的地方的所有为了替人民争取民族独立和自由而不得不对暴力进行报复的人们。大会谴责所有那些认为争取独立和自由的人们都是普通罪犯的法律。
    关于建立常设机构的决议说，会议坚决决定对于剥夺非洲人民的自由、自由权利和基本人权的作法发动最后的进攻，并且决定在阿克拉建立常设秘书处。秘书处的宗旨和目标如下：
    一、促进非洲各国人民的互相了解和团结；
    二、加速把非洲从帝国主义和殖民主义底下解放出来；
    三、动员世界舆论来反对剥夺非洲人的政治权利和基本人权的做法；
    四、在非洲各国人民中培养一种大家庭的情感，以便于将来出现非洲合众国。
    第三项决议要求殖民国家从它们所占领的领土上撤走，把主权交给由普选产生的非洲民主政府。
    大会主席姆博亚在大会闭幕前宣布，突尼斯政府已经邀请下届全非人民大会在突尼斯举行。
    新华社阿克拉13日电  全非人民大会主席姆博亚今天在大会闭幕会议上致闭幕词时说，“非洲正处在一个新时代的开端，它正在从受少数外国人统治的殖民主义黑暗和
  屈辱的年代，进入一个被承认为世界上的一种力量的时期。”他说，尽管语言和血统不同，尽管他们是第一次会晤，代表们已经找到了团结的基础，解放非洲的各项决议就是在这种基础上草拟的。
    姆博亚说，非洲的自由战士“不倾向东方，也不倾向西方。我们只是致力于形成非洲的特性”。
    他说，全非人民大会的召开不是为了要进行宣传和作空谈，而是要行动。他说，建立常设机构就是为了协调和指导行动。他说，会议在阿尔及利亚问题上所通过的决议，要求采取行动，使问题立即得到和平解决。在南非问题上，大会支持南非人民的不合作运动。在这个问题上将要采取积极的行动，对南非实行经济抵制的可能性正在考虑中。
    在谈到安哥拉问题的时候，姆博亚指责葡萄牙殖民主义者在那里设置铁幕。他说，但是，安哥拉并不是葡萄牙不可分割的一部分；非洲各国人民将给安哥拉人民以物质的和其他方面的支持。
    姆博亚说，“我们相信非暴力行动”，但是，这不是“消极的”，这意味着“积极的行动”。他说，人民是否不得不使用暴力，这取决于帝国主义的态度，如果他们被迫而采取暴力，那是一种报复行
  动。
    加纳总理恩克鲁玛继姆博亚之后在会上讲了话，他强调非洲各国人民团结一致的重要性。他说，非洲所以软弱，其根源在于不团结。他号召代表们在回国以后组织广泛的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的统一阵线。
    他说，现在，非洲决心要获得自由，这是世界上任何力量都阻止不了的。他说，会议常设机构应当执行大会通过的决议。
    他还谈到非洲性格、非洲联邦以及“泛非社会主义”等问题。（附图片）
