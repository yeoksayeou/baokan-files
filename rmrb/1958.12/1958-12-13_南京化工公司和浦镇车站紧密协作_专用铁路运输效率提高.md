Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 12th: After the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company and the Puzhen Railway Station of the Nanjing Railway Bureau strengthened their communist spirit of cooperation, they improved the efficiency of dedicated railway transportation, which not only ensured the transportation of factory materials but also improved the station's operational level.

The dedicated railway line from Puzhen to Dachang Town is jointly used by Yongli Ning Factory and Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, as well as Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 and Changjiang Brick and Tile Factory, all of which belong to the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company. It is managed by the Joint Transportation Station of Nanjing Chemical Industry Company, and the two locomotives are also uniformly dispatched by the transportation station. In the past, the two sides often argued, resulting in vehicles staying in the factory for as long as eight hours or more, which greatly affected transportation efficiency. After the high-yield industrial movement with steel as the key link was launched, the volume of transportation increased greatly. When vehicles arrived in a concentrated manner, there was a tense situation where they could not be unloaded, loaded, or dispatched. The factory was often threatened with shutdowns due to insufficient supply of raw materials. At the end of September, the Ministry of Railways held a national railway telephone conference, conveying instructions on railway work, requiring all employees to accelerate vehicle turnover and ensure the "ascent of the steel marshal." This conference was very educational for both the factory and the station. The staff of Puzhen Station strictly inspected the station's work and believed that the task was not well completed, mainly because political leadership was insufficient and the spirit of cooperation was not good. The factory transportation station also conducted a comprehensive study of the work, criticizing the idea of one-sided emphasis on "workshop supply first," and believed that it was necessary to not only do a good job in internal factory transportation, but also work with railway workers to speed up vehicle turnover.

After the factory and station reached a unified understanding of dedicated railway transportation, they helped each other and a new relationship of close cooperation between the factory and station emerged. The station proposed "four concerns": concern for the factory's production needs, concern for the factory's work difficulties, concern for the factory's transportation level, and concern for the factory's staff's lives. The factory lacked shunting personnel and the efficiency of the locomotives could not be fully utilized, so the station transferred three shunters to support the factory. The stationmaster personally went to the factory to help formulate operating procedures for the two locomotives, which doubled the efficiency of locomotive use. The station sometimes organized employees, family members, and residents to help the factory with crash unloading. The factory tried every possible means to load and unload quickly, and tried to shorten the time vehicles stayed in the factory. They carried out technical revolutions on a large scale and manufactured a batch of mechanical equipment to improve loading and unloading efficiency. The station did not have its own locomotives, and shunting operations often encountered difficulties, so the factory took the initiative to send locomotives to assist.

In order to cooperate better, the factory and station staff were uniformly organized into three joint labor shifts, the locomotives were uniformly dispatched, and they worked according to a unified work plan, and unified leadership, unified inspection, and unified summarization were carried out. The leaders of both sides often organized employees to sit down together to exchange experiences. In November, a new record of shortening the time vehicles stayed in the factory to 2.7 hours was achieved.

Recently, the Transportation Committee of the CPC Nanjing Municipal Committee held an on-site meeting on railway and factory transportation cooperation at the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company to promote their experience.

    南京化工公司和浦镇车站紧密协作
    专用铁路运输效率提高
    据新华社南京12日电  南京化学工业公司和南京铁路局浦镇车站加强共产主义协作精神以后，使专用铁路运输效率提高，既保证了工厂物资的运输，又提高了车站作业水平。
    浦镇到大厂镇的专用铁路线，是南京化学工业公司所属永利宁厂、南京磷肥厂以及南京钢铁一厂、长江砖瓦厂等单位共同使用的，由南京化学工业公司联合运输站管理，两台机车也由运输站统一调度。过去双方常扯皮，以致车辆在厂停留时间长达八小时以上，大大影响了运输效率。以钢为纲的工业高产运动展开以后，运输量大增，车辆集中到达时，出现卸不下，装不上，挂不出的紧张局面。工厂因原料供应不及，经常受到停工威胁。9月底，铁道部召开全国铁路电话会议，传达了关于铁路工作的指示，要求全体职工加快车辆周转，保证钢铁元帅升帐。这次会议给厂、站双方教育很大。浦镇车站职工严格检查了车站的工作，认为任务完成得不好，主要是政治挂帅不够，协作精神不好。工厂运输站也对工作进行了全面研究，批判了片面强调“车间供应第一”的思想，认为既要搞好厂内运输，又要和铁路职工一道加快车辆周转。
    厂、站双方对专用铁路运输有了统一认识以后，我帮你、你帮我，出现了厂站一家亲密协作的新的关系，车站提出“四关心”：关心厂方生产需要，关心厂方工作困难，关心厂方运输水平，关心厂方人员生活。工厂缺乏调车人员，机车效率不能充分发挥，车站就抽调三个调车员支援工厂，站长并亲自到厂帮助制定两台机车作业办法，使机车的使用效率提高一倍。车站有时还组织职工、家属和居民帮助工厂突击卸车。工厂千方百计快装快卸，尽量缩短车辆在厂停留时间。他们大搞技术革命，制造一批机械设备，提高装卸效率。车站没有自备机车，调车作业常常发生困难，工厂就主动派去机车协助。
    为了更好地协作，厂站双方职工统一编成了三个联合劳动班，机车统一调度，按统一的作业计划办事，并统一领导、统一检查、统一总结。双方领导经常组织职工在一起座谈，交流经验。11月车辆在厂停留时间曾出现缩短到二点七小时的新纪录。
    最近，中共南京市委交通运输委员会在南京化学工业公司召开铁路与厂矿运输协作现场会议，推广了他们的经验。
