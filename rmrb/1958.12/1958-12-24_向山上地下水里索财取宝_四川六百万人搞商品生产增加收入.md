    Sourcing Wealth and Treasure from Mountains, Underground Water
    Six Million People in Sichuan Engage in Commodity Production to Increase Income

    (By Our Correspondent) Sichuan Province, in developing diverse economic production, is grasping both the plans for next year and the present situation, comprehensively arranging labor, and vigorously promoting mass movements. Since early December, under the slogan of "Developing diverse economy, achieving a comprehensive great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery," six million laborers have been mobilized daily across the province, marching comprehensively towards mountains, underground, skies, and waters, achieving significant results.

    After the bumper harvest of grain, vigorously developing commodity production of diverse economy to support national construction and increase the income of people's communes is the inspiring call issued by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the people of the province not long ago. Over the past month, the entire province, from the province to the special districts, counties, districts, and communes, has been formulating plans for developing diverse economy next year at each level. Simultaneously, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities have included the development of diverse economy as one of the central contents of winter production and made arrangements for it. These arrangements, in addition to ensuring the proper cultivation of various economic crops and medicinal herbs that are currently in the planting season, also prominently focus on the breeding of poultry and livestock, the collection and purchase of aquatic products and local specialties, as well as the processing and transportation of agricultural products. Currently, various localities have proposed that the total value of diverse economic commodity production this winter and next spring will reach approximately 1 billion yuan.

    In response to the extremely busy agricultural work this winter, Party committees at all levels in the province have comprehensively arranged labor, divided battle lines, organized teams, and extracted 20% to 30% of the total labor force to establish a large army for developing diverse economy. On this basis, various localities have readjusted labor organizations, established various fixed or temporary specialized teams, adapting to local conditions and individual skills, ensuring that every item is managed and every task is assigned. Yingshan County organized more than 15,000 commune members with feeding experience into specialized brigades for fattening pigs. At the same time, young and strong commune members were organized for transportation and processing, women and children were organized to undertake the hatching and raising of chickens, ducks, and geese, and herb farmers were organized to plant and collect medicinal herbs. It was ensured that every household had sideline occupations and no household had idle people.

    In order to seize the season and make the movement effective and rewarding quickly, various localities have generally adopted the method of continuously launching small movements, one task connecting to another, one movement connecting to another, to carry out shock production. This also ensured that, when needed, specialized teams and mass movements could be combined, concentrating more labor to achieve greater results. In early December, Yibin Special District launched a district-wide movement to harvest economic forest products and dig for medicinal herbs on the mountains. More than 40% of the labor force in the district was mobilized, and in less than ten days, the total value of production reached more than 6.9 million yuan, averaging about 3 yuan per person in the district. This method of movement has also been widely promoted in one county, one district, and one commune.

    The development of diverse economy includes a large scope, complex content, and wide involvement. Therefore, from the beginning of the movement, Party committees at all levels in Sichuan have attached great importance to strengthening leadership over the movement. Special agencies for developing diverse economy have been established at all levels from the special districts to the counties, districts, and communes. These agencies are attended by the heads of relevant departments, with the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels taking personal command, focusing on planning, starting with ideological education, promptly resolving various problems, and ensuring the rapid development of the movement. Many local leading cadres have also engaged in "experimental fields," and cadres at all levels and the masses participate in production together.

    Due to the strengthening of leadership and the vigorous promotion of mass movements, the enthusiasm of farmers throughout the province for developing diverse economy is very high. The province originally planned to fatten 7 million pigs before the Spring Festival, but after mass discussion, the original target was greatly exceeded. Now, the areas that started early have already fattened more than 1.1 million pigs. Breeding of draught cattle has also progressed very rapidly, with more than 1 million cows already pregnant. According to incomplete statistics from only four special districts, the recent cash income has exceeded 30 million yuan. (Yu Jingqi)

    向山上地下水里索财取宝
    四川六百万人搞商品生产增加收入
    本报讯  四川省在发展多种经济生产中，既抓明年又抓当前，全面安排劳动力，大搞群众运动。12月上旬以来，在“发展多种经济，农、林、牧、副、渔全面大跃进”的口号下，全省各地每天都出动了六百万劳动大军，向山上地下空中水里全面进军，取得了很大的成绩。
    粮食大丰收以后，大力发展多种经济的商品生产，支援国家建设和增加人民公社收入，是中共四川省委不久以前向全省人民发出的振奋人心的号召。近一个月来，全省从省到专、县、区、社正层层制订明年发展多种经济的规划。和这同时，各地又按照省委指示，把发展多种经济列为冬季生产的中心内容之一，并做了安排。这些安排除保证种好当前正值栽种季节的各种经济作物和药材外，还突出地抓紧了家禽、家畜的繁殖，水产、土特产的采集和收购，以及农产品的加工、运输等。目前各地提出今冬明春搞多种经济商品生产的总值已达十亿元左右。
    针对今年冬季农活十分繁忙的情况，全省各级党委普遍对劳力进行了全面安排，划分战线，组织队伍，抽调了总劳力的20％到30％建立一支发展多种经济的大军。在这一基础上，各地重新调整了劳动组织，成立各种固定的或临时的专业队，因地制宜、因人制宜，做到条条有人负责，样样有人经营。营山县把有饲养经验的社员一万五千多人组成催肥猪的专业大队。同时，组织年青力壮的社员搞运输和加工，组织妇女小孩担任鸡、鸭、鹅的孵化和饲养，组织药农种药和上山采药。做到了家家有副业，户户无闲人。
    为了抓住季节，使运动见效快、收效大，各地普遍采取了不断开展小运动的方式，一个任务连接一个任务，一个运动连接一个运动，进行突击生产。这样做，也保证了在需要时使专业队伍和群众运动结合起来，集中更多的劳动力，夺取更大的战果。宜宾专区在12月初开展了一次全区的收获经济林产品和上山挖药运动，全区出动40％以上的劳力，不到十天，生产的总值就有六百九十多万元，全区平均每人达三元左右。在一县、一区、一社中，这种运动的方式也已得到了普遍地推广。
    发展多种经济包括的范围大，内容繁杂，牵涉的面广。因此，运动一开始，四川各级党委就十分重视加强对运动的领导。各专区到县、区、社都层层建立了发展多种经济的专门机构。这些机构由各有关部门的负责人参加，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，以规划为中心，从思想教育入手，及时解决各种问题，保证了运动的迅速开展。许多地区领导干部还大搞“试验田”，各级干部和群众一块参加生产。
    由于加强领导和大搞群众运动，全省农民发展多种经济的斗志十分高昂。全省原计划春节前催肥猪七百万头，但经过群众讨论后便大大突破原定指标，现在开展早的地区已催肥了一百一十多万头。耕牛配种也进展得十分迅速，受孕母牛已达一百万头以上。仅据四个专区的不完全统计，最近的现金收入，就已超过三千万元。  （于竞祁）
