    Through the Golden Ring of "1070"...
    Ge De
    10.7 million tons of steel completed!
    To say this is the completion of a great plan; to say this is an unprecedented victory; to say we feel joy, happiness, excitement, and emotion about this; to say we sing, praise, and extol it... I think all this is still not enough. In previous steel production, never has it been like this, melting in the profound feelings deeper than maternal love, the solidarity stronger than steel, of 600 million people; in previous steel production, never has it been like this, melting in the precious blood and sweat of 600 million people (previously only melting in the precious sweat of steelworker brothers), never melting in the labor of a full 600 million people – the noblest thing in the world.
    We Chinese deeply understand the importance of steel; we understand that we suffered over a hundred years of bullying due to a lack of steel, so we love steel; but previous love for steel was never like today's love. Steel, in our feeling, is no longer just a hard and cold thing, but also a living being with flesh and blood. The golden and dazzling number "1070" is the giant solidified by this flesh and blood.
    Golden and dazzling "1070," dancing before my eyes, it gradually expands. Every character transforms into a radiant golden ring, like a rainbow in the sky, like the archway of a happy garden on earth.
    Through this golden ring, I saw: in front of those earthen furnaces, we were sweating, expecting the birth of something like a baby. But it failed, so we refined it again: putting the broken iron we smashed with our own hands, the glass shards, the alum or lime, the coke or firewood, back into the furnace. The flames rose, the wind fanned... we were sweating and waiting again. Finally, a handsome steel infant was born, born in the brilliant sparks. How many times have we cheered for the birth of this infant! We held him to report the good news to our Party, spreading the word among relatives and friends: it's refined, it's refined! But this is only one cell of "1070," but these cells, melted by 600 million people, gathered on the torso of the steel giant produced by various steel bases, forming "1070," this steel stalwart.
    Through the golden ring, I saw: the ordinary yet great labor of 600 million people, in those days and months of fighting for steel, how did it converge into such a huge torrent? This is another red storm. People roused their power, commanded the wind and clouds, their voices shook the universe, their spirit pierced the rainbow. How many cheers did we win from our brothers and friends, and how many enemies did we frighten to tremble!
    This torrent and storm of the ordinary yet great labor of 600 million people has opened up a broad road for us. Our beloved Party named it: taking steel as the key link, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining large, medium, and small enterprises, a mass movement to vigorously develop steel. Yes, it is a mass movement, a large-scale, vigorous mass movement. What a beautiful and magnificent name this is in human history. We are proud of this but not arrogant. We sing for this, but we must continue to advance under this banner.
    Through the golden ring, I also saw: what kind of small black things are those, wriggling in the dark corners? Gradually, I saw them clearly: they were "Westerners" wearing black suits and top hats. Why is there such a contemptuous look on their white faces? What are they saying, pursing their lips and gesticulating? They are saying that "1070" is a delusion, a dream, a fantasy, impossible to complete at all; but soon, their faces changed, their contemptuous look disappeared, they waved their fists and cursed: cursing us as slaves, as machines, cursing us as "human wave tactics"; but finally, they could no longer wave their fists, their teeth-gritting mouths twitched, ah, we had never seen such a frightened look. They shouted, "We must pay attention to this achievement, but don't panic." Isn't that Dulles? Why did he say that the capitalist world had fallen into the ruthless encirclement of communism? Everything is clear. They despised us, thinking we were poor and technologically backward, and could never complete the "dream" of "1070." They didn't see that we would have a nationwide steelmaking movement. Then they cursed this movement, fabricated rumors and slandered this movement, and finally had to comfort their followers in terror, "Don't panic." This is truly a bunch of stupid people!
    Splitting the long sky of the night, lightning and thunder came from outside the window, and those poor little black things were shaken and dissipated like light smoke. Ah! In the cold winter night, could it be that the earth has quietly and suddenly returned to spring? I leaned out the window to look. The blue flash that split the sky turned out to be construction workers welding steel frames. In the distance came the whistle of a train. The train is now running on steel rails. On top of it should be steel, machinery, steel rails, and roof trusses.
    Looking up at the long sky, among the twinkling stars, a red golden ring gradually condensed again. "1070" hangs in the sky like a rainbow. Below it is our socialist motherland, prosperous and strong, that we are building!

### 透过“1070”的金环……

    透过“1070”的金环……
    葛德
    1070万吨钢完成了！
    说这是完成了一个伟大的计划；说这是取得了一次史无前例的胜利；说我们对这感到欢欣、快愉、兴奋、激动；说我们对它欢唱、赞美、歌颂……我以为这都还不足。以前的钢里，不曾像它这样溶铸进了六亿人民比母爱还深的感情，比钢还坚的团结；以前的钢里，没有像它这样溶铸进六亿人民珍贵的血汗（以前只是溶铸进了钢铁工人兄弟们的珍贵的汗滴），未曾溶铸进过整整六亿人的劳动——这个世界上最崇高的东西。
    我们中国人深深懂得钢的重要，我们明白我们曾因缺乏钢受人家一百多年的欺侮，所以我们爱钢；但以前的爱钢没有像今天这样的爱。钢，在我们的感觉里，它不再只是质硬而冷的东西，而且也是一个有血有肉的生命了，‘1070’这个金光灿烂的数字，便是用这血肉凝结成的巨人。
    金光灿烂的“1070”啊，在我眼前跳动着，她渐渐地扩大开来了。每一个字，都化成了一个光芒万丈的金环，像天上的长虹，像人间幸福大花园的圆拱门。
    透过这金环，我看到了：在那土炉群前，我们流着汗，期待着一个像婴儿似的东西的诞生。然而失败了，于是我们重新炼过：把那亲手砸破的碎铁，那玻璃渣，那明矾或石灰，那焦炭或木柴，再溶合到炉中去。火焰升发了，风煽动了……我们又流着汗期待着。终于，一个英俊的钢的麟儿出世了，在那灿烂的火花中出世了。我们曾为这婴儿的出世作过多少次欢呼啊！我们捧着他向我们的党去报喜，在亲友中奔走相告：炼成了，炼成了。然而这只是“1070”的一个细胞，但这由六亿人民所溶铸的颗颗细胞，汇集在由各个钢铁基地所产生的那钢铁巨人的躯干上，形成了“1070”这个钢的伟丈夫。
    透过金环，我看到了：六亿人的平凡而又伟大的劳动，在那些为钢而战的日月里，又曾经汇合成怎样巨大的洪流啊，这是又一次的红色风暴，人们抖擞神威，叱咤风云，声震寰宇，气贯长虹。我们曾博得多少兄弟朋友们的喝彩，我们又曾吓得多少敌人发抖啊！
    这六亿人平凡而又伟大的劳动的洪流和风暴啊，为我们辟开了康庄的大道。我们亲爱的党为它命名，称之为：以钢为纲，土洋并举，大中小结合的大搞钢铁的群众运动。是的，是群众运动，是大规模的、轰轰烈烈的群众运动。这在人类历史上是一个多么美好而又壮丽的名字啊。我们为此自豪但并不骄傲，我们为此欢唱，但我们更要在这个旗帜下继续前进。
    透过金环，我又看到了：那是一些什么样的黑色小东西，在黑暗的角落里蠕动？渐渐看清了：原来是些穿黑色礼服的，带着高帽子的
  “西方人士”。在他们白色的脸上，为什么会有那么一种轻蔑的神气，他们撇着嘴指手划脚地说些什么呀？他们在说：“1070”是妄想、梦想、幻想，根本不可能完成；可是不久，他们的脸色变了，轻蔑的神色消失了，他们挥动着拳头，咒骂起来：骂我们是奴隶，是机械，骂我们是“人海战术”；可是，终于，他们的拳头挥不动了，咬牙切齿的嘴抽搐起来了，那惊恐的眼神啊，我们还没有见到过。他们在嚷：“我们要重视这成就，但不要惊慌”。那不是杜勒斯吗？他为什么要说资本主义世界落入了共产主义无情的包围圈中了呢？一切都明白了，他们轻蔑我们，以为我们一穷二白，技术落后，绝对完不成“1070”的“梦想”，他们没有看到我们会有一个全民的炼钢运动，接着他们便咀咒这运动，造谣诬蔑，恶语中伤这运动，而终于不得不又在惊恐中去安慰他们的追随者“不要惊慌了”。这真是道道地地的一群蠢人！
    划破深夜的长空，窗外传来了闪电和雷鸣，那些可怜的黑色小东西，被震荡得淡烟似的消散了。啊！在寒冷的冬夜里，莫非大地也悄悄地突然回春了么？我探身到窗外去了望。那划破长空的蓝色闪光，原来是建筑工人们在焊接钢架；远处传来的是火车汽笛的啸声。火车此时正在钢轨上奔驰。在它的上面，该是一些钢材、机械、钢轨和屋架吧。
    仰望长空，闪闪的星点中，又逐渐凝起了赤色的金环，“1070”像长虹一样悬在天空。在它的下面，是我们正在建设着的，繁荣、富强的社会主义祖国！
