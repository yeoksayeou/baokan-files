    Huangfanqu Farm Breeds Large Numbers of Hybrid Dairy Cows
    (Our report) The state-owned Huangfanqu Farm in Xihua County, Henan Province, has successfully crossbred Dutch bulls with local Nanyang yellow cows and has achieved great development. After purchasing six Dutch bulls two years ago, the farm began using them to crossbreed with Nanyang yellow cows. The first generation of hybrid cows that grew after crossbreeding were 140 cm tall, 160 cm long, with well-developed udders, and could produce more than 20 catties of milk per day. The second generation of hybrid cows increased milk production to more than 40 catties per day, and the third generation increased to more than 70 catties, reaching the general level of Dutch dairy cow production. The crossbred bulls had a traction force that was one-third to one-half greater than that of local cattle. The farm has now bred more than 150 hybrid dairy cows and more than 100 bulls.
    Hybrid dairy cows not only grow quickly and are easy to feed, but also have very low costs. Importing a Dutch dairy cow costs several thousand yuan in foreign exchange, while a local cow costs only forty or fifty yuan.

    黄泛区农场繁殖大量杂种奶牛
    本报讯  河南省西华县国营黄泛区农场，用荷兰种牛与本地南阳黄母牛杂交配种成功，并得到很大发展。这个场在两年前购进六头荷兰种牛以后，就开始用它和南阳黄母牛杂交配种。杂交后生长的第一代杂种牛，体高一百四十公分，体长一百六十公分，乳房发达，可日产牛奶二十多斤。杂交的第二代牛日产奶量增至四十多斤，第三代增至七十多斤，赶上了荷兰种奶牛产量的一般水平。杂交所生的公牛，牵引力比本地牛增长三分之一到二分之一。这个场现已繁殖杂种奶牛一百五十多头，公牛一百多头。
    杂种奶牛不但生长快，好饲养，而且成本很低。进口一头荷兰种奶牛要耗费数千元外汇，一头本地母牛只不过四、五十元。
