    The President's Worries
    Chi Bei'ou
    Another year is coming to an end, Christmas has just passed, why is the President frowning? It's not that he had a fight with his wife, nor that he lost a few rounds of golf. It's that life is getting harder and harder, and the "free world" is getting worse day by day. The economic crisis is still serious, the policy of strength has completely failed, the "allies" are heading for division, and everyone wants the American devils to get out. But on the other side of the "world" is: a vibrant and beautiful scene. The east wind is strong and the west wind is waning. Who knows what will happen next year, how can he not be worried?

    总统的愁闷
    池北偶一年又到岁晚，刚刚才过圣诞，总统何事愁眉不展？不是同夫人吵了嘴，也不是打高尔夫输了几盘。是日子越来越不好过，“自由世界”一天比一天烂。经济危机依旧严重，实力政策全部破产，“盟国”走向四分五裂，到处要美国佬滚蛋。而在“世界”的另一边却是：春色满园一片灿烂。东风疾劲西风残，明年还不知怎办，叫他如何不心烦？
