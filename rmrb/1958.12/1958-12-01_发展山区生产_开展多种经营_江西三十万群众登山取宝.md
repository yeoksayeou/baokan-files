    Developing Mountain Area Production, Engaging in Diversified Management
    300,000 People in Jiangxi Ascend Mountains to Gather Treasure
    (Our dispatch) On the thousands of large and small mountains in Jiangxi Province, crowds surge daily, with songs and laughter rising and falling. This is the commune members of various people's communes ascending the mountains to gather ten thousand treasures and harvest various local specialties. In the Gannan area, over 10,000 cadres lead more than 300,000 people active in the Jiulian Mountains and Dayu Ridge. Their slogan is: "Camp in the jungle, traverse the mountains of ten thousand treasures, ascend the mountains to gather ten thousand treasures, gather treasures by the ten thousands of dan!" They adopt the method of "four sides" (side by side harvesting, side by side purchasing, side by side processing, side by side dispatching and transporting) and "six up the mountain" (leaders taking the lead to go up the mountain, the masses going up the mountain, samples going up the mountain, technology going up the mountain, purchasing going up the mountain, processing going up the mountain). In five days, according to incomplete statistics from thirteen counties, a total of more than 41.61 million jin of various wild plants collected by the masses were purchased, exceeding ten times the total purchase volume from January to October, and the variety increased by 150 species.
    Jiangxi is a mountainous area with extremely rich mountain resources. According to surveys, in addition to rich mineral resources such as tungsten, iron, coal, manganese, porcelain clay, and tin, there are also more than 120 kinds of chemical industrial raw materials, wild plant oils and fats, and papermaking raw materials. Many, such as camphor, large-leaf camphor oil, litsea cubeba, cotton stalk skin, and indigo, are important raw materials for industrial construction, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and daily necessities. The province can purchase more than 2.5 million dan of wild plant fiber this year. If processed, it can produce more than 1.2 million dan of rayon.
    These productions will significantly increase the income of the people's communes. According to statistics, small and medium-sized local specialties account for 19.75% of the province's total industrial and agricultural output value. If this year's production plan is realized, the production of wild plants and animal products alone can increase the income of commune members by more than 340 million yuan. Therefore, party organizations throughout the province attach great importance to this work. In addition to the provincial party committee's decision to use 15% of the province's labor force as the basic team for this production, a comprehensive arrangement has also been made for the labor force based on the large variety of agricultural and sideline local specialties this year, the large purchase volume, the concentrated time, as well as the nationwide effort to produce steel, the autumn harvest and planting, and the deep plowing of land.

    发展山区生产  开展多种经营
    江西三十万群众登山取宝
    本报讯  江西省千万座大大小小的山头上，每天人群滚滚，歌声、欢笑声，此起彼伏，这是各公社社员们正在登山取万宝，采摘各种土特产。赣南地区一万多名干部领导的三十多万群众，活跃在九连山、大余岭一带。他们的口号是：“露宿丛林里，走遍万宝山，登山取万宝，取宝万万担。”他们采取“四边”（边采摘、边收购、边加工、边调运），“六上山”（领导带头上山、群众上山、样品上山、技术上山、收购上山、加工上山）的方法，五天的工夫，据十三个县的不完全统计，共收购群众采集的各种野生植物四千一百六十一万多斤，超过1至10月份收购总数的十倍，并且品种增加了一百五十种。
    江西是个多山地区，山上资源十分丰富。据调查，除有丰富的钨、铁、煤、锰、瓷土、锡等矿产以外，还有化学工业原料，野生植物油脂油料及造纸原料等一百二十多种。像樟脑、大叶樟油、山苍子、棉秆皮、土靛等许多都是工业建设，医药制造与生活用品等方面的重要原料。全省野生植物纤维今年可以收购二百五十多万担，如果经过加工后，可制造人造棉一百二十多万担。
    这些生产将使人民公社收入显著增加。据统计全省中小土特产占全省工农业总产值19.75％，如果实现今年生产计划，仅野生植物、畜产品两项生产，即可使全省社员收入增加三亿四千多万元。因此，全省各地党组织对这项工作非常重视，除省委决定全省以15％的劳力为此项生产的基本队伍外，还根据今年农副土特产品种多、收购量大、时间集中以及全民大闹钢铁、秋收秋种、深翻土地等情况，对劳力做了全面的安排。
