Xinhua News Agency, Brussels: The Belgian newspaper "Red Flag" published several articles in mid-November, pointing out that the residents of the Belgian Congo lived inhuman lives under the cruel exploitation of the colonial authorities. The articles cited many materials to indicate that the health of the Congolese residents was consistently poor. They often did not have enough to eat, and their eating habits were also abnormal. Some tribes only ate one meal a day, and sometimes only one meal every two days. This affected the health of the indigenous residents. Malnutrition resulted in miscarriages, high infant mortality rates, and physical weakness.

The articles stated that the Belgian Congo was also plagued by diseases. Indigenous people of the Belgian Congo, like the indigenous people of Angola, Rhodesia, and Cameroon, cannot escape the terrible scourge of tropical diseases.

The articles pointed out that the poor health of the Congolese indigenous residents was inseparable from the colonial authorities' disregard for local sanitation measures. Now, vast areas of the Congo have no doctors and insufficient medical personnel. In the Giri region, which covers more than 17,000 square kilometers and has 45,000 indigenous people, there are only two clinics in total, each with only one health worker.

The articles stated that many indigenous workers are now forced to do work they are not accustomed to in European-owned businesses. Due to insufficient physical strength, they naturally cannot meet the productivity requirements demanded of them at the beginning. However, the entrepreneurs in the Congo reversed the problem, using the excuse that productivity was often low to refuse to increase the wages of indigenous workers. They refused to raise wages on the grounds that black people's "traditional food is like this," believing that black people are "used to malnutrition." Under the pretext of "educating" the Congolese laborers, the entrepreneurs generally did not pay them all their salaries in cash but implemented a food ration system. However, the food rations were generally calculated inaccurately. Some workers labor in the mountains, and the labor they put in is actually more than eight hours, while their food rations can only sustain the physical exertion of two hours of intensive labor.

    殖民统治罪恶无穷
    比属刚果人民生活悲惨
    据新华社讯  布鲁塞尔消息：比利时“红旗报”11月中旬刊载了几篇文章，指出比属刚果的居民在殖民当局的残酷剥削下过着非人的生活。文章引用许多材料指出，刚果居民的健康状况始终很坏。他们经常吃不饱，进食也是不正常的，某些部族每天只吃一顿，有时两天才吃一顿。这样就影响土著居民的健康。营养不足的结果造成流产，婴儿死亡率高、体质虚弱。
    文章说，比属刚果也疾病丛生。比属刚果的土著，像安哥拉、罗得西亚和喀麦隆的土著一样现在都逃脱不了热带病症的可怕祸害。
    文章指出，刚果土著居民这种恶劣的健康状况是同殖民当局漠视当地的卫生措施分不开的。现在刚果整片广大地区没有医生，没有足够的卫生人员；在面积一万七千平方公里以上、拥有四万五千土著的吉里地区，总共只有两个医务所，每处只有一个卫生人员。
    文章说，许多土著劳动者现在都被迫在欧洲人的企业中做他们所不习惯的工作。体力不足，当然在开始时不能达到要求于他们的生产率。然而，刚果的企业主们把这个问题颠倒过来，他们借口生产率往往很低而拒绝提高土著工人工资。他们以黑人“历来的食粮就是如此”为理由拒绝提高工资，认为黑人是“惯于营养不足的”。企业主借口要“教育”刚果劳动者，一般发给他们的薪金并非全部是现款，而实行粮食配给制度。然而配给粮一般都计算得不准确。有些工人在山上劳动，他们付出的劳动实际上不止八小时，而他们的配给粮只能维持二小时强度劳动的体力消耗。
