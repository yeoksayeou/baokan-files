Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 9th. Steelworkers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company are tapping equipment potential deeply, and the furnace output of large and small open hearth furnaces is continuously expanding. On December 6th, the steel output per furnace of large open hearth furnaces surged from 150 tons to 222 tons, and small open hearth furnaces jumped from 45 tons to 102 tons.

The original design capacity of the large open hearth furnaces at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company was 50 tons, and the design capacity of the small open hearth furnaces was only 10 tons. After continuous expansion, the large open hearth furnaces have now been expanded to 150 tons, and the small open hearth furnaces have been expanded to 45 tons. Each time the open hearth furnaces are enlarged, the main equipment is not increased, but a portion of auxiliary production equipment is added accordingly, and the steel output increases exponentially. Some people believe that as the furnaces are continuously enlarged, the original medium-sized open hearth furnaces have become large open hearth furnaces, and the small open hearth furnaces have become medium-sized open hearth furnaces, making further increases in production difficult. However, the workers in the steelmaking workshop criticized this "potential has reached its limit" thinking, believing that as long as the laws of furnace production are grasped and equipment and operations are continuously improved, production potential is inexhaustible. The small open hearth furnace workers, based on the "two-step charging" steelmaking method created by Zhang Wenjin, an advanced producer in the workshop, and the "step-by-step charging" steelmaking method created in October, have developed it further by continuously infiltrating molten iron during steelmaking, increasing the capacity of each furnace. When the post-furnace equipment was unbalanced, the workers came up with a method of discharging steel with double troughs and four ladles, changing from using two ladles for steel discharge to four ladles, solving the problems of insufficient post-furnace crane load capacity and small ladle capacity.

### 掌握生产规律大挖潜力  重钢大小平炉产量激增

    掌握生产规律大挖潜力
    重钢大小平炉产量激增
    据新华社重庆9日电  重庆钢铁公司炼钢工人大挖设备潜力，大小平炉炉产量不断扩大。12月6日，大平炉每炉产钢量从一百五十吨猛增到二百二十二吨，小平炉从四十五吨跃到一百零二吨。
    重庆钢铁公司的大平炉原来设计能力是五十吨，小平炉设计能力只有十吨；经过不断改大以后，大平炉现在已经扩大为一百五十吨，小平炉扩大为四十五吨；平炉每次改大以后，主要设备不增加，相应地增加一部分辅助生产设备，钢产量却成倍地增加。有的人认为，炉子不断改大，原来的中型平炉已变成大型平炉，小型平炉已变成中型平炉，再增产就不容易了。但是炼钢车间职工批判了这种“潜力到顶”的思想，认为只要掌握炉子生产规律，继续改进设备和操作，生产潜力是挖不尽的。小平炉工人在车间先进生产者张文金所创造的“两步装料”炼钢法，以及十月份创造的“分步装料”炼钢法的基础上加以发展，在炼钢时不断渗进铁水，增大了每炉的容量；炉后设备不平衡，职工们就想出了双槽四包出钢的方法，由平时两个钢包出钢改用四个钢包出钢，解决了炉后行车负荷能力不够和钢包容量小的问题。
