    Solving the Difficulty of Insufficient Teachers, Breaking Through Old Teaching Methods
    Lanzhou University Students Teach at Part-Time Schools
    (Our Newspaper) Lanzhou University undergraduates teaching outside the university have played a role in solving the difficulty of insufficient teachers.
    The teaching activities of Lanzhou University students began in March of this year. At that time, many organizations, schools, factories, and district committees in Lanzhou City were running schools and hiring university teachers to teach their courses. However, the number of university teachers was limited and could not meet all the needs. The school proposed using undergraduates as teachers as a way to solve this problem. However, the students had concerns at the time, worried that they did not have teaching experience and could not do the job. After repeated persuasion and mobilization by the school, more than ten senior students from the Chinese and Mathematics departments took on the university courses at four schools, including Red and Expert University, Teachers College, and Part-Time University.
    Because the students broke through the old methods in teaching, they lectured with a clear class viewpoint and stance, and their teaching was supported and praised by the students.
    Most of the lecture notes of these students were discussed by the masses. Some groups compiled the lecture notes and solicited opinions from others to supplement or revise them; other students worked with their original teachers to compile new lecture notes. Lin Li, a student in charge of the general outline course at Donggang District Part-Time University, compiled his lecture notes with several of his classmates. Because they cooperated and helped each other, the quality of the lecture notes was improved, and cumbersome textual research and repeated parts were deleted, striving for conciseness and easy understanding.
    The party organization and administrative leaders of Lanzhou University gave a lot of care and consideration to this group of teaching students. When some teachers had ideological concerns, the party branch immediately carried out persuasion, explanation, and encouragement. Some less important social activities and study time at the school were excused for them, allowing them to prepare lessons. The department's reference room, which was originally reserved for teachers, is now also open to them for browsing materials. They are given as much convenience as possible in terms of teaching aids.
    Lanzhou University students teaching at part-time universities is a good way to solve the current shortage of teachers.

### 解决师资不足困难  冲破教学中的老套  兰大学生到业余学校任教

    解决师资不足困难  冲破教学中的老套
    兰大学生到业余学校任教
    本报讯  兰州大学在校学生外出任课，对解决师资不足的困难起了一定作用。
    兰州大学学生的教学活动是从今年3月开始的。当时兰州市许多机关、学校、工厂、区委纷纷办学，大量聘请大学教师给他们担任课程。但是，大学教师数量有限，不能满足全部需要。学校提出以大学生任教的办法来解决。但是，学生当时思想上有顾虑，担心自己没有教学经验，不能胜任。经过学校的再三说服动员，中文系和数学系的十多名高年级学生，才分别担负起红专大学、师范学院、业余大学等四个学校的大学课程。
    由于学生在教学上冲破了老一套，他们以鲜明的阶级观点和立场讲课，教学得到受课者的拥护和称赞。
    这些学生的讲义大部分经过群众讨论，有的一个小组编好讲义，征求别人意见进行补充或修改；还有的学生和原来教他们的先生一起编写新讲义。担任东岗区业余大学概论的学生林立，他的讲义就是由他的同班同学几个人在一起编写的。由于他们互相协作和帮助，讲义质量提高了，繁琐的考证和前后重复部分都给作了删除，力求精练和通俗易懂。
    兰州大学的党组织和行政领导，对这批教书的学生，都给予很多关怀和照顾。有人当先生思想上有顾虑，党支部即进行说服解释、鼓励。学校中一些不甚重要的社会活动和自习时间准许他们不参加，让他们进行备课。系里的资料室原是专门给先生预备的，现在也让他们进去翻阅资料。在教课用具等方面，都尽量给以方便。
    兰州大学学生到业余大学教书，这是目前解决师资不足的一个好办法。
