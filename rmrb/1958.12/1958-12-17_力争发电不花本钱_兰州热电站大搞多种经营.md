To gradually realize the goal of "zero-cost power generation," the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant has broken away from the limitations of single operation and is vigorously developing diversified operations and comprehensive utilization while ensuring normal power supply.

With the rapid development of industrial construction, the comprehensive utilization of coal has great significance. In the past, power plants consumed large amounts of coal, only using it as fuel. This year, in the upsurge of the whole Party and all the people running industry in a big way, the plant's Party committee studied the comprehensive utilization of coal and coal ash, and decided to start with indigenous methods. In just forty-eight days, they built a coal refining plant with an annual output of 35,000 tons of semi-coke, 1,900 tons of coal tar, and 80 million cubic meters of coal gas. It was put into production in September. The semi-coke extracted by this plant is equivalent to the same amount of raw coal; the 80 million cubic meters of coal gas can replace the burning capacity of 12,000 tons of coal. By transporting the semi-coke and coal gas to the boiler for combustion instead of burning coal, 47,000 tons of raw coal can be recovered. In this way, the coal gas has achieved multiple utilization purposes. They plan to further extract gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, asphalt, and other products from coal tar and coal gas. While comprehensively utilizing coal, the coal ash, which used to be discarded as waste, is also being utilized. After more than a month of experimentation, valuable rare metals have been extracted from coal ash, and large-scale production will begin next year. They have also used coal ash to make 300-grade cement and are building a cement plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons, which will soon be completed and put into production. Recently, they also extracted a chemical raw material – alumina – from coal ash. It has high hardness and is a valuable raw material in the aluminum industry. In order to bring comprehensive utilization into a normal production order, the plant has established two comprehensive utilization workshops and a comprehensive utilization research group, specializing in research work. They are now studying the extraction of industrial raw materials such as ammonium nitrate from coal ash.

The development of this plant is not only a large-scale thermal power plant, but also a manufacturing plant for various electrical equipment. A motor equipment manufacturing plant has been built and is producing 1,000 kW, 3,000 kW, and 6,000 kW thermal power generating equipment; it also manufactures various motors with a capacity of 65,320 kW. The reactors used in power distribution were mostly supplied from abroad, but now they can also be manufactured by themselves, enabling the plant's equipment maintenance to be completely self-reliant.

    力争发电不花本钱
    兰州热电站大搞多种经营
    本报讯  兰州热电站为逐步实现“无成本发电”的方向，打破了单一经营的限制，在正常供电的同时，充分利用资源，大搞多种经营和综合利用。
    随着工业建设的迅速发展，煤的综合利用有重大的意义。过去电厂每天消耗大量的煤，只是将煤当作燃料。今年，在全党全民大办工业高潮中，厂党委研究了煤和煤灰的综合利用问题，决定土法先上马，只在四十八天内就建起一座年产半焦三万五千吨，煤焦油一千九百吨和八千万立方公尺煤气的煤炼油厂，已在9月间投入生产。这个厂提炼出的半焦，相当于同数的原煤；八千万立方公尺的煤气，可以代替一万二千吨煤的燃烧能力，把半焦和煤气运送到锅炉里燃烧来代替燃煤，就可收回四万七千吨原煤。这样，使煤气达到了多种利用的目的。他们计划进一步从煤焦油和煤气中提炼汽油、煤油、柴油、沥青等多种产品。在综合利用煤的同时，过去被当作废物丢掉的煤灰也加以利用。经过一个多月的试验，已从煤灰中提炼出贵重的稀有金属，明年将大量生产。他们还用煤灰制成了三百号水泥，正在修建一座年产五万吨的水泥厂，不久即建成投入生产。最近还从煤灰中提炼出一种化工原料——氧化铝，硬度很大，是制铝工业上的贵重原料。这个厂为了使综合利用走上正常的生产秩序，成立了两个综合利用车间和综合利用研究小组，专门从事研究工作。现在，正研究从煤灰中提炼硝酸氨等工业原料。
    这个厂的发展，不仅是一个大型热电站，而且是一个各种电器设备的制造厂。已经建成的一座电机设备制造厂，正在生产着一千瓩、三千瓩、六千瓩的火力发电设备；还制造容量为六万五千三百二十瓩的各种电动机。配电上用的电抗器原来大部分是国外供应，现在也能自己制造。使这个厂的设备检修完全走上自力更生的道路。
