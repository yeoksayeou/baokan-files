    Dedicating Youth to the Cause of Childcare
    I am a childcare worker in the kindergarten of the Satellite People's Commune in Wendeng County, Shandong. Initially, I didn't fully appreciate this job, thinking that "watching children is not promising." Some young people even ridiculed me, and my mother didn't approve of me doing this work. At that time, I was in a very intense ideological struggle and once considered quitting. However, through constant education from the Party and the Youth League organizations, and their help in solving some specific problems in my work, my awareness was raised. I gradually overcame individualistic thoughts of gain and loss and established a firm sense of dedication to the childcare work.
    At first, I knew nothing about childcare work, having only studied for six days in a childcare training class. When we first started, the children were reluctant to come, so we tried to find ways to attract them. We first mobilized fifteen children, leading them in games, singing songs, and telling stories. This way, the children became interested and were willing to come to the kindergarten. The number of children gradually increased, from fifteen to thirty. However, the teaching methods were still the same old routine, and after a while, the children became a little bored. We then bought several books on preschool education, studied them carefully, and worked hard to delve into them. Usually, when we encountered difficulties and didn't understand something in our work, we would ask others for advice. We also visited the county government's nursery to learn from their advanced experiences.
    Over the past three years, we have rapidly improved our professional skills by adopting the method of learning while teaching and studying diligently, and have gradually expanded the kindergarten. Now the kindergarten has a total of six hundred and eighty-two children.
    We treat every child like our own younger siblings, trying our best to make their lives happier and their play more enjoyable. The children also have deep feelings for me. Living with the children makes me feel very happy and fulfilled. I am willing to dedicate my precious youth to the noble cause of childcare.

    把青春献给保育事业
    我是山东文登县卫星人民公社的幼儿队的教养员。开始我对这个工作认识不足，认为“看孩子，没有出息”。有些青年又讽刺我，母亲也不同意我作这个工作，这时，我思想斗争非常激烈，曾经一度打算不干。经过党和团的组织对我不断的进行教育，并帮助我解决了工作中一些具体问题，使我提高了觉悟，逐渐克服了患得患失的个人主义思想，树立了坚定的保育工作事业心。
    开始我对保育工作是一窍不通的，只是在保育训练班学习了六天。刚开办时，孩子都不愿来，我们就想办法来吸引孩子。先动员了十五名孩子，领着他们玩，唱歌讲故事，这样孩子就感到了兴趣，愿意到幼儿园来。孩子逐渐增多了，由十五名增加到三十名。可是教学上还是老一套，日子久了，孩子们有些厌烦。我们便买了几本幼儿教学方面的书，认真地学习和刻苦的钻研。平时在工作中碰到了困难和不懂的地方，就去请教别人。我们又去参观和访问了县机关托儿所，学习他们的先进经验。
    三年来，我们采取边教边学和认真钻研的办法，迅速地提高了业务水平，并使幼儿园逐渐发展壮大起来。现在幼儿园共有六百八十二名儿童。
    我们对每一个孩子都像对待自己的弟妹一样，想尽一切办法使孩子们生活得更幸福玩得更愉快。孩子们对我也有了深厚的感情。跟孩子们生活在一起，使我感到非常的愉快和幸福。我愿意把宝贵的青春献给崇高的保育事业。
