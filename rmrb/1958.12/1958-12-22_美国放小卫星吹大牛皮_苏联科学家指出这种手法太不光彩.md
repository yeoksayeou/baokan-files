Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th. Soviet Academician Sedov exposed on the 20th the bragging by the United States about the successful launch of the world's largest artificial satellite.

The United States launched an artificial satellite with an effective weight of only 67.5 kilograms on the 18th, but they sensationally added the weight of the carrier rocket that entered orbit to it, shouting that it was the largest artificial satellite in the world, with a weight more than twice that of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite, and so on.

Academician Sedov said in an interview with a TASS reporter on the 20th: "Anyone with technical knowledge can clearly see that this new American satellite cannot be said to surpass any of the three Soviet satellites in terms of weight. We might mention that the effective weight of the first Soviet satellite was 83.6 kilograms, the second satellite was 508.3 kilograms, and the third satellite was 1,327 kilograms, while the effective weight of the American satellite is only 67.5 kilograms. In order to create a sensation, the United States combined the weight of this new satellite with the weight of the four-ton carrier rocket that entered orbit."

Academician Sedov said: "Experts and the general public know that when the Soviet Union launched satellites, the carrier rocket also entered orbit and existed for a long time, and the carrier rocket and instrument container of the second satellite were not separated, which is the same as the current situation in the United States. However, the weight of the carrier rocket does not explain the research capabilities of the scientific instrument container and the effective payload that the rocket can carry. Therefore, the weight of the carrier rocket that launched the Soviet satellite at that time was not published in the newspapers."

Academician Sedov continued: "If the ratio of effective payload to carrier rocket weight is one to fifty-seven (as is the case with the American satellite), then the weight of the last stage carrier rocket of the Soviet Union's third satellite, which orbited the earth for six months, should be more than 75 tons, while the American satellite's is only four tons. Even if the weight of the Soviet carrier rocket that entered orbit is less than 75 tons, this weight is still much larger than four tons." He said that this applies not only to the carrier rocket of the Soviet Union's third satellite, but also to the carrier rockets of the first and second satellites.

Academician Sedov said: "I can say with certainty that the weight of the carrier rocket of the Soviet Union's first satellite, which only entered orbit and revolved around the earth for two months, is much heavier than four tons."

Academician Sedov said: "The reasons listed above are very simple, and all rocket technology experts are very clear about them. Therefore, there is reason to say that many people who are publicizing that the new American artificial satellite is the heaviest artificial satellite are also very clear about this. I think it is dishonorable for people to carry out this kind of publicity."

Academician Sedov concluded: It must be emphasized that the altitude and duration of the satellite's orbit are the most important indicators.

Everyone knows that the lowest altitude of the newly launched American artificial satellite is only 184 kilometers according to official American announcements, and it can only exist in the air for about 20 days.

### 美国放小卫星吹大牛皮  苏联科学家指出这种手法太不光彩

    美国放小卫星吹大牛皮
    苏联科学家指出这种手法太不光彩
    新华社莫斯科20日电  苏联科学家塞道夫院士20日揭穿美国吹嘘发射成功一个世界上最大的人造卫星的牛皮。
    美国在18日发射了一个有效重量只有六十七点五公斤的人造卫星，但他们却耸人听闻地把进入轨道的运载火箭的重量同它加在一起，大叫大嚷说是世界上最大的人造卫星，其重量超过苏联的第三个人造卫星两倍多，云云。
    塞道夫院士20日在答复塔斯社记者的一次访问中说：“所有懂技术的人都可以十分清楚地看到，美国这个新卫星在重量上根本谈不到胜过苏联三个卫星中的任何一个。我们不妨提一下，苏联第一个卫星的有效重量是八十三点六公斤，第二个卫星是五百零八点三公斤，第三个卫星是一千三百二十七公斤，而美国卫星的有效重量只有六十七点五公斤。为了耸人听闻，美国把这个新卫星的重量同进入轨道的重达四吨的运载火箭的重量凑在一起了。”
    塞道夫院士说：“专家们和广大公众都知道，在苏联发射卫星的时候，运载火箭也进入轨道并存在很长一段时间，而第二个卫星的运载火箭和仪器容器就没有分开，这同美国现在的情况是一样的。但是运载火箭的重量并不能说明科学仪器容器的研究能力以及火箭所能负荷的有效载重量。因此，当时发射苏联卫星的运载火箭的重量没有在报纸上发表。”
    塞道夫院士接着指出：“如果有效载重量与运载火箭重量为一与五十七之比（美国卫星就是如此），那么绕地球旋转了六个月的苏联第三个卫星的最后一级运载火箭的重量应该是七十五吨多，而美国卫星的只有四吨。即使进入轨道的苏联运载火箭的重量小于七十五吨，但是这个重量也要比四吨大得多。”他说，这不仅指苏联第三个卫星的运载火箭，而且也包括第一个和第二个卫星的运载火箭。
    塞道夫院士说：“我可以肯定地说，只是进入轨道绕地球旋转了两个月的苏联第一个卫星的运载火箭的重量就比四吨要重得多。”
    塞道夫院士说：“上面列举的理由非常简单，这是所有的火箭技术专家都十分清楚的。因此有理由说，许多大肆宣传美国新的人造卫星是最重的人造卫星的人对这一点也是十分清楚的。我认为，进行这种宣传的人是不光彩的。”
    塞道夫院士最后说：不能不强调指出，卫星轨道的高度和存在的时间是最重要的标志。
    大家知道，美国新发射的人造卫星的最低高度按美国官方宣布只一百八十四公里，在空中只能存在二十天左右。
