    Anhui Actively Reforms Water Conservancy Tools, Total Number More Than Doubled Compared to Last Year

    (Our report) Anhui Province's Party committees at all levels have vigorously mobilized the masses to reform water conservancy tools, improving them on one hand and promoting them on the other. Significant results have now been achieved in the rapid improvement and promotion of water conservancy tools. According to the December 5th statistics from the Provincial Agricultural Tool Reform Office, the province has manufactured and promoted over 2.73 million advanced water conservancy tools, approximately three times more than the total number manufactured and promoted last winter and this spring. These advanced water conservancy tools cover the entire water conservancy project, from excavation and transportation to compaction. The tools used are diverse, including gantry-type excavators and steep-slope splitting machines; aerial earth transportation lines and long-distance over-mountain earth transportation machines; double-rail trolleys, turntable dump trucks, train-style dragline earth transportation machines, and rope-traction earth transportation machines, and so on. These advanced water conservancy tools have already demonstrated tremendous power on construction sites, significantly improving work efficiency and greatly reducing the labor intensity of the workers. Taking Fuyang Prefecture as an example, the number of workers on December 5th in this prefecture was over 1.02 million, of which semi-able-bodied laborers accounted for about half. Due to the widespread use of advanced water conservancy tools, the average work efficiency per person in the entire prefecture on that day reached 17 cubic meters. The average work efficiency per person in the three counties of Fuyang, Bo, and Mengcheng was all above 25 cubic meters. The widespread use of advanced water conservancy tools has inspired the broad masses, who are experiencing labor shortages amidst the overall leap forward in industry and agriculture, to be full of confidence in completing the water conservancy tasks for this winter and next spring.

    In the work of creating and promoting advanced tools, leaders in various regions have also vigorously mobilized the masses to solve the problems of raw material supply and manufacturing technology. Hebei Township in Dangshan County, based on full mobilization of the people, contributed more than 20,000 jin of scrap iron and self-raised 2,400 trees for timber. They also taught the masses the techniques for manufacturing simple advanced tools, and the whole township quickly manufactured more than 700 trolleys, 30 sets of aerial earth transportation devices, 2,000 flatbed trucks, 79 tractors, and more than 1,000 meters of track. Many areas throughout the province have established on-site repair and assembly plants at water conservancy construction sites to rush-produce advanced tools. Bo County has established a large number of repair and assembly groups on water conservancy construction sites, with iron and woodworking workers trial-producing and manufacturing locally. The county has newly manufactured and reformed more than 100,000 pieces of various advanced tools, basically achieving one piece per worker in the county. (Li Xiangren)

    安徽积极改革治水工具总数超过去年二倍以上
    本报讯  安徽省各级党委大力发动群众改革治水工具，一面改进，一面推广，现已取得了治水工具改的快、推广的快的显著效果。据省委农具改革办公室12月5日的统计，全省共制造和推广的先进治水工具已达二百七十三万多件，约等于去冬今春全省制造和推广的治水工具总和的三倍以上。这些先进的治水工具包括从挖土，运土到夯实的整个治水工程。所使用的工具，种类繁多，有龙门式挖土机和陡坡劈土机；有空中运土线和长途越岭运土机；有双轨滑车、转盘斗车、列车式拖斗运土机和绳索牵引运土机等等。这些先进治水工具在工地上已发挥巨大威力，工效显著提高，民工劳动强度大大减轻。以阜阳专区为例，这个专区12月5日上工人数是一百零二万多人，其中半劳力约占一半，由于广泛使用了先进治水工具，全专区当天平均每人工效达十七公方。阜阳、亳县、蒙城三个县的民工全县平均每人工效都在二十五公方以上。广泛使用先进治水工具，鼓舞了广大群众在工农业全面跃进中产生劳力不足的情况下，对完成今冬明春的治水任务充满着信心。
    各地领导在先进工具的创造和推广工作中，还大力发动群众解决原材料供应和制造技术问题。砀山县河北乡在全民发动的基础上，共献出废铁二万多斤，自筹木料二千四百棵。并把制造简单的先进工具的技术传授给群众，全乡很快制造了滑车七百多部，空中运土器三十套，平板车二千辆，牵引机七十九部，轨道一千多公尺。全省很多地区都在水利工地建立了工地修配厂，赶制先进工具。亳县在治水工地上大量建立修配组，铁木工人就地试制和制造，全县已新制改制成各种先进工具十万多件，基本上达到全县每个民工人手一件。      （李祥仁）
