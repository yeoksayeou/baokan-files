    A Confidant of Depositors
    Sun Shufang
    Gao Ying, a female clerk at the "March 8th" Savings Office of the Changchun Branch of the People's Bank of China, has been working at the bank for less than a year. However, because she loves her job, constantly and diligently studies her work, frequently understands and is familiar with the psychology of depositors, and enthusiastically serves them, she has gained the trust and respect of the masses and has become a confidant of depositors.

    "You're More Thoughtful"
    Before an old lady with white hair even reached the counter, Gao Ying stood up and said, "Grandma, you're here. You must be tired from walking. Come in and have a glass of water and rest. ...Grandma, are you withdrawing or depositing?" The old lady took out one hundred and twenty yuan from her pocket and said:
    "What kind of deposit do you think is best?" It seemed that the old lady trusted her very much.
    "Grandma, if you don't need the money for the time being, how about depositing one hundred yuan as a fixed deposit and twenty yuan as a current deposit with a chance to win a prize?"
    The old lady said with a smile, "Okay, we'll do whatever you say. You're more thoughtful than I am..."

    "Come Deposit When You Have Spare Money"
    I don't remember which Monday it was, but a worker from the First Automobile Works was strolling in a store when Gao Ying warmly greeted him, "Comrade, are you depositing money? We have current savings, fixed savings, fixed-amount prize-winning savings, and fixed deposit lump-sum withdrawal prize-winning savings..." She rattled off a long list while taking out various types of savings deposit books and filling the counter with them. Then she explained in detail:
    "...Current savings can be withdrawn at any time. Fixed-amount prize-winning savings are both fixed and current. If you need money, you can withdraw it as a current deposit, and if you don't need it, it's a fixed deposit..." Before Gao Ying finished speaking, the comrade took out three hundred yuan from his pocket and said:
    "Comrade, please deposit this as a six-month fixed deposit! To be honest, I didn't come to deposit money. Today is my day off, and I came to the city to play. Your service attitude is too good, so I'll deposit the money here! I'll come to you to deposit whenever I have spare money..."

    "Extra" Things
    In the morning, just as Gao Ying was sorting out the accounts and money, an old man outside the current prize-winning savings window wanted to clear out his entire deposit of one hundred and twenty-three yuan to buy a sewing machine at another store. Gao Ying thought to herself: The leaders often say, "We must not only do our own business well, but also help depositors with things outside of business. This is also a way to connect with depositors and attract deposits." Thinking of this, Gao Ying felt very enlightened. She immediately stood up and said, "Old man, buy it at this store! The sewing machines will be coming downstairs here soon. If you don't have time, I can choose the best one for you." The old man was happy to hear Gao Ying's words and said:
    "That's great. You help me like this, I am very grateful. It is really good that the country is good, and the cadres who are trained are also good!"

    A few days later, the sewing machines arrived, and Gao Ying went to find the old man. Because she was not familiar with the way to his house, she went once and could not find him, so she quickly sent the old man a letter. The third day the old man came, and when he saw Gao Ying, he held her hand tightly and said with emotion:
    "Comrade, you really can do things for the people. It's really good that the country is good, and the cadres who are trained are also good!"

    Now, Gao Ying has been selected as an outstanding service worker in the city.

    储户的知心人
    孙叔芳
    中国人民银行长春市分行“三八”储蓄所的女服务员高英同志，参加银行工作还不到一年，但由于她热爱自己的工作，不断虚心刻苦地钻研业务，经常了解和熟悉储户的心理，并热心为他们服务，取得了群众的信任和尊敬，成了储户的知心人。
    “还是你想的周到”
    一位满头白发的老太太还没走到柜台面前，高英就站起来说：“大娘您来了，走累了吧，快进来喝碗水歇歇吧。……大娘，您取款还是存款啊？”老大娘从兜里拿出一百二十元钱说：
    “你看存什么样的好呢？”看样子老大娘是非常信任她了。
    “大娘，如果您暂时不用的话，就存一百元定期，二十元活期有奖的好吗？”
    老大娘笑呵呵地说：“行呀，你说怎么咱们就怎么的，你比我想的周到……。”
    “有余钱就来存”
    记不清是哪个月的星期一，第一汽车制造厂的一位职工到一商店闲走，高英热情地向这位同志打招呼：“同志，你存款吗？我们有活期储蓄，定期储蓄，还有定额有奖储蓄，零存整取有奖储蓄……。”她一口气说了一大套，边说边把各种储蓄种类的存折都拿出来摆满了柜台，接着她又详细地解释着：
    “……活期储蓄随用随取，定额有奖储蓄是定活两便，如果你要用钱取它就是活期的，可以随时取，不用就是定期的……”还没等高英说完，这位同志就从兜里拿出三百元说：
    “同志，请你给我存定期六个月的吧！说实话，我本不是来存款的，今天是我休班，到市里来玩的，你的服务态度太好了，我就把款存在你这里吧！以后有余钱就到你这儿来存……”
    “分外”的事
    早晨，刚上班，高英正在整理账、款。这时活期有奖储蓄窗口外，有一位老大爷要把一百二十三元的存款全结清，想到另外一个商店去买缝纫机。高英心里想：平常领导上常说，“我们不仅要做好自己的业务工作，而且还要帮助储户做业务以外的事情，这也是联系储户、吸收存款的一种办法。”想到这，高英心里非常豁亮。她马上站起来说：“老大爷，你就在这个商店买吧！缝纫机这儿楼下很快就要来了，如果您没有时间，我可以给你选择一台最好的。”老大爷听完高英的话，高兴地说：
    “那太好了。你们这样帮助我，我太感激了，那我就不取了，还存在这儿吧！”
    不多几天，缝纫机来了，高英就去找老大爷。因为她不熟悉去他家的路，去了一趟没有找到，她就赶紧给老大爷去了一封信。第三天老大爷来了，见到高英就紧紧地握着她的手感动地说：
    “同志，你真能为群众办事，真是国家好，教养出来的干部也好！”
    现在，高英已被选为市的优秀服务员。
