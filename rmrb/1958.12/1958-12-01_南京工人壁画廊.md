    Under the leadership and support of the factory Party committees and trade unions, amateur art activities of Nanjing factory and mining workers have been widely carried out. Art groups and art studios have been established in slightly larger factories, and some are preparing to establish amateur artists' associations. They closely combine with the central tasks of each period, creatively utilize various forms to serve production, especially after the great leap in production, the amateur art creation of workers and staff has been unprecedentedly high, and the number of people participating in amateur art activities has increased even more. From January to September this year, Nanjing Chenguang Machine Factory held more than 40 exhibitions and completed 40,000 creations; the art group has grown from a few people to 12 groups with more than 200 people. Each workshop and department has an art group, including workers, staff, cooks, cleaners, doctors, and trade union chairmen, with young workers as young as 18 and old masters as old as 50 participating in art creation activities.
    Before this year's National Day, Nanjing launched a large-scale mural movement with more than 5,000 people participating, basically realizing muralization. Among the large number of murals created by workers and staff in their own factories and nearby streets, many outstanding works have emerged. In order to promote the mural movement, improve the quality of mural creation, and encourage amateur art creators from various factories to compete with each other, the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Preparatory Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Artists Association decided to open a large "Nanjing Workers' Mural Gallery" near Xin Jie Kou. In completing the painting of this gallery, which is about 300 meters long, 85 amateur art creation backbones from 36 factories in Nanjing were concentrated, and 72 new works were painted. These paintings attract a large number of pedestrians every day, and foreign experts visiting Nanjing also appreciate these creations, and they are also filmed by the Sino-Soviet joint production team of "Yangtze River - Volga River".
    Visiting this gallery does not require much introduction or explanation, and you will know that these are murals created by workers, because in these works, most of them reflect the great leap in industrial production, reflect the life and struggle of their factories, and praise new inventions and new achievements. The "Overtaking" painted by the art group of Nanjing Chenguang Machine Factory praises the fact that the Changjiang brand car successfully trial-produced by their factory has surpassed the British same-type famous brand Austin car in its main performance. The "Winning the First Battle" painted by the art group of Nanjing Jincheng Machinery Factory and the "Electronic Tube Shining" painted by the art group of Nanjing Electronic Tube Factory all express their new creations after hard work and hard labor. They also wrote many poems in conjunction with the paintings, making the mural gallery more interesting and lively. The Nanjing Radio Factory's art group painted the high-quality Panda brand radio produced by their factory, and wrote a poem next to it, expressing their pride: "Panda brand is my name, singing for peace all day long, traveling all over Asia, Africa and Europe, and then to South America to spread friendship, people from all countries welcome me, and the US imperialism is so angry that it stares." Blacksmiths reflected their workshop going to the countryside to "help farmers repair farm tools", "deliver meals to the workshop", and "transport ore", all reflecting the new people and new things after the Great Leap Forward. They expressed their practical actions in the picture. There are also many works in this gallery that reflect the great leap in agriculture and other aspects of China's leap forward development. These works are full of life, with simple shapes and expressive expressions. Therefore, we say that this is a gallery of the Great Leap Forward, because these authors are participants in this magnificent and magnificent great struggle, so they can truly reflect the face of this struggle. This gallery, like other murals, has played a role in political propaganda, inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, enriched the cultural life of the masses, and beautified the city.
    The "Nanjing Workers' Mural Gallery" has bright and clear colors, and diverse forms and styles, including cartoons, traditional Chinese paintings, sketches, propaganda posters, and portraits of technical innovators. Their creations are imaginative, boldly exaggerated, and fascinating. However, mural creation is only a part of the amateur art creation of workers and staff. More works are meeting with the vast number of workers and staff through exhibitions, factory newspapers, and various competition columns. (Attached picture)

    “南京工人壁画廊”
    徐天敏
    南京厂矿职工业余美术活动在厂党委和工会的领导、支持之下，已广泛的开展起来了。在稍大的工厂里都建立了美术组、美术室，有些正筹备成立业余美术家协会。他们紧密地结合各个时期的中心任务，创造性地利用各种形式为生产服务，尤其在生产大跃进之后，职工业余美术创作空前高涨，参加业余美术活动的人数更为众多。南京晨光机器厂从今年1月份到9月份就举办过各种展览会四十余次，完成创作四万幅；从几个人的美术小组发展到二百多人的十二个小组，每个车间、科室都有了美术组，其中有工人、职员、炊事员、清洁员、医生、工会主席，有十八岁的青工到五十多岁的老师傅参加美术创作活动。
    今年国庆节前南京开展大规模的壁画运动，有五千余人参加，基本上实现了壁画化。职工在自己工厂和工厂附近街道创作的大量壁画中，出现了许多优秀的作品。南京市文化局、江苏省美术家协会筹委会为了推动壁画运动，和提高壁画创作质量，并鼓励各厂业余美术作者相互竞赛，决定在新街口附近开辟一个大型的“南京工人壁画廊”。在完成这个长约三百公尺的画廊绘制中，集中了南京三十六个工厂的八十五位业余美术创作骨干，画了七十二幅新作。这些画每天吸引着大批的行人，来南京访问的外国专家也很赞赏这些创作，并且还被中苏两国合制的“长江——伏尔加河”摄影队拍摄入镜头。
    参观这个画廊，不需多加介绍和说明，你就会知道这是工人创作的壁画，因为在这些作品中，他们大多是反映工业生产大跃进的，反映他们工厂的生活和斗争，赞扬新的发明创造和新的成就。南京晨光机器厂美术组画的“超车”，是赞颂自己厂试制成功的长江牌汽车在主要性能上已超过英国同类型名牌奥司丁汽车。南京金城机械厂美术组画的“旗开得胜”、南京电子管厂美术组画的“电子管放光芒”等都是表现自己经过苦战，经过辛勤劳动的新创造，他们结合着画，还写了许多诗歌，使壁画廊更加有趣、活跃。南京无线电厂美术组画自己厂出品的质量优良的熊猫牌收音机，旁边写了一首诗歌，表现出自豪感：“熊猫牌是我名，整日歌唱保和平，走遍亚非和欧洲，又到南美传友情，各国人民欢迎我，美帝气的干瞪眼”。锻工反映自己车间下乡“帮助农民修农具”，“送饭下车间”、“运矿石”等都反映了大跃进之后的新人新事。他们在画面上表示了自己的实际行动。在这个画廊里还有很多作品是反映农业大跃进和我国飞跃发展的其它方面。这些作品充满了生活气息，造型纯朴、神情十足。因此，我们说这是个大跃进的画廊，因为这些作者是这个气魄雄伟和波澜壮阔的伟大斗争的参加者，所以他们能够真实地反映这场斗争的面貌。这个画廊和其它壁画一样，起了政治宣传作用，鼓舞了广大群众的革命干劲，丰富了群众的文化生活，美化了城市。
    “南京工人壁画廊”色彩鲜艳、明朗，形式、风格多样，有漫画、国画、速写、宣传画，也有技术革新者的肖像画。他们的创作富于想像，大胆夸张，引人入胜。但是，壁画创作仅是职工业余美术创作的一部分，更大量的作品是通过展览、厂报、各种竞赛栏和广大职工见面的。（附图片）
