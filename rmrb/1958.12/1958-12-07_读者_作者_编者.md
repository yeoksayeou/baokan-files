	Helping us recognize poisonous weeds and tares
	The article "Resolutely Uproot the White Flag on the Screen" written by Comrade Chen Huangmei, published on the seventh page of the People's Daily on the 2nd of this month, is worth reading carefully. When we watched these movies in the past, we also felt there were problems, or that they were uncomfortable. But ideologically, we were not clear, and some even thought they were good. This article clarified many wrong and vague views and helped us improve our ability to identify poisonous weeds and tares. Therefore, I also think that newspapers should strengthen film reviews, mobilize the audience to write film reviews, everyone should participate, and eliminate poisonous weeds and tares in a timely manner, and eliminate the toxins of certain bad films in a timely manner. Discussions can also be held when necessary.

	The reports on diversified economy are concentrated and powerful
	The People's Daily reported on the front page of the November 18th issue in the headline position that Yanggu County is comprehensively and massively developing livestock and poultry production, and clearly proposed in the title that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery should all be grasped. The agricultural page news has successively introduced a lot of experience in collective chicken and pig raising, and the commentator on the 22nd pointed out that the current people's communes are vigorously developing collective poultry farming, which is an inevitable trend of "success comes naturally." Your organization of reports in this area is very concentrated and powerful, and it is instructive for practical work.

	Reading "Let Youth Radiate Light in the Borderlands"
	After reading the article "Let Youth Radiate Light in the Borderlands" written by Zhao Qi and Ge Lai in the People's Daily on December 2nd, I was very moved. These young people who responded to the call of the Party and the motherland to participate in the construction of the borderlands of the motherland, fear no difficulties, overcome all difficulties, and fight in the grasslands covered with white snow at an altitude of four thousand meters, the sparsely populated basins, and the forests where the sky cannot be seen. They have lofty ideals, do not feel hardship at all, and always feel happy and proud. This is worth learning from us. After reading it, I thought: I will graduate this year, and I will resolutely respond to the call to go to the borderlands and advance side by side with them.

	Good experience in conducting communist education
	The People's Daily published on the sixth page of the November 19th issue the preliminary experience of Datong Brigade, Huangmei People's Commune, Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, in carrying out communist education. Their approach is that the leaders conduct theoretical research to understand the situation, first of all, clarify the thinking of the cadres, hand over ideological weapons to the poor and lower-middle peasants, refute the "suffering losses" theory, and advocate a communist labor attitude. Such experience is of great help to carrying out socialist and communist education work. I hope you will continue to report in depth on this aspect in the future.

	Hope to have such special pages often
	The supplement "Frontline - Countryside" in the People's Daily on November 30th is well compiled. Through the depiction of the heroic figures and heroic deeds of Hecuo Village in Xiamen, it truly reflects the fighting life of the coastal people. Under the leadership of the Party, men, women, and children have been encouraged to work hard, regardless of the enemy's artillery fire, steelmaking, farming, and supporting their own troops. Some of the poems and articles in the special page are written by these heroic figures and collectives, which makes people feel more cordial and moving.
	I hope the editors often go down to mobilize the masses to write and draw themselves, and compile such special pages.

    帮助我们认清毒草、莠草
    本月2日人民日报第七版刊载了陈荒煤同志写的“坚决拔掉银幕上的白旗”，这篇文章值得我们很好地去读。我们过去看这些电影，也感到有问题，或是觉得不舒服。但在思想上并不明确，有的甚至还认为是好的。这篇文章澄清了许多错误和模糊的看法，帮助我们提高了对毒草、莠草的识别能力。因而我也想到报纸应该加强影评工作，发动观众写影评，人人动手，及时铲除毒草、莠草，及时消除某些坏影片的毒素。必要时还可展开一些讨论。

    对多种经营的报道集中有力
    人民日报11月18日第一版在头条地位报道了阳谷县全面地大量地发展家畜家禽生产，并在标题中鲜明提出农、林、牧、副、渔样样都要抓。农业版新闻中陆续介绍了不少集体养鸡、养猪的经验，22日评论员又指出了目前人民公社大力发展集体养禽事业，已经是“水到渠成”的必然趋势了。你们组织这方面的报道，是很集中有力的，对实际工作有指导意义。

    读“让青春在边疆发射光芒”
    读了12月2日人民日报上赵奇、格来写的“让青春在边疆发射光芒”一文，很受感动。这些响应党和祖国号召参加祖国边疆建设的青年人，不畏险阻，排除万难，战斗在拔海四千公尺白雪茫茫的草原、渺无人烟的盆地和仰不见天的林海中，他们有远大理想，丝毫不觉得艰苦，而时时感到幸福和自豪。这是很值得我们学习的。读后我想到：我今年毕业，一定坚决响应号召到边疆去，同他们并肩前进。

    进行共产主义教育的好经验
    11月19日人民日报第六版上刊登了江苏句容县黄梅人民公社大同大队开展共产主义教育的初步经验。他们的作法是领导务虚认清形势，首先辩通干部思想，把思想武器交给贫农和下中农，驳倒“吃亏”论，提倡共产主义劳动态度。这样的经验对开展社会主义和共产主义教育工作有很大的帮助。希望你们今后在这方面继续深入报道。

    希望经常有这样的专页
    人民日报11月30日副刊“前沿—乡村”专页编得好。通过对厦门何厝村的英雄人物、英雄事迹的描绘，真切地反映出沿海人民的战斗生活。他们在党的领导下，男女老幼鼓足了革命干劲，不顾敌人的炮火，炼钢、种庄稼，而且支援自己的部队。专页中有的诗歌、文章是这些英雄人物和集体写的，更令人感到亲切动人。
    愿编辑同志经常下去发动群众自己写、自己画，编出这样的专页。
