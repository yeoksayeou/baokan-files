Tempered Out!
	Liǔ Dí

	As the train arrived, one after another, robust young men jumped out, full of vigor. The welcoming crowd surged forward, grasping their hands—hands that were coarse and strong, covered in calluses. Their bodies had grown stronger, their faces darker; the pale-faced students had transformed into red-faced Guan Gongs, wearing enthusiastic, simple smiles. People chatted warmly: "They've gotten tanned!" "They've gained weight!" "They've turned red!"...

	I suddenly recalled the scene when the office was smelting steel. When the first batch of steel came out, everyone anxiously waited by the furnace. As soon as the fiery red molten steel flowed from the furnace mouth, people couldn't help but shout: "It's tempered out! It's tempered out!"

	Indeed, indeed, the comrades who were sent down have been tempered in the great crucible of labor. Hands becoming coarse and faces darkening are only superficial changes. More importantly, their ideological awareness and mental outlook have turned red. Their labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint have been strengthened, their class viewpoint is more firm and clear than before, and the bourgeois viewpoints of intellectuals—that of self-importance and disdain for manual labor and working people—have undergone significant changes. In labor, they have gained a more correct understanding of the wisdom, diligence, and simplicity of the people, and they have cultivated the feelings of the working people. At the same time, they have also learned a great deal of production knowledge. Speaking of gains, this can be regarded as the most important and most valuable.

	Some may not believe: "Is labor training really so effective?" Naturally, the comrades who are sent down do not all achieve the same level of gain after laboring. But, for those who have a correct understanding of labor training and can carry out labor training seriously and consciously, the changes in their ideological awareness, stance, viewpoints, and work style are rapid. I saw a comrade who had returned from being sent down sincerely say to the organization when they were assigning work: "I will definitely listen to the Party. Whatever the Party tells me to do, I will do it honestly and delve into it!" These few words sound ordinary. During the Great Leap Forward, people's communist ideology soared, and "Wherever the Party points, we will go!" has become the slogan of action for conscious people. However, it is truly not easy to hear these words from this comrade's mouth, and to hear them spoken so earnestly. Before being sent down, he often picked and chose his work, looked down on ordinary labor, and only wanted to do profound and complex research work; now, in just over a year, the self-admiring intellectual had actually put down his airs and developed feelings for the working people. The difference between before and after is like two different people.

	Although the comrades who were sent down did not spend a long time in the countryside, the practice of labor was constantly criticizing the various erroneous ideas of despising manual labor, and constantly testing the knowledge of intellectuals who considered themselves extraordinary. Some seemingly simple labor proved to be clumsy and powerless for intellectuals who "do not move their limbs"; some perhaps very basic production knowledge revealed the knowledge poverty and helplessness of intellectuals who "cannot distinguish the five grains." Manual labor is like a mirror. When reflected in the mirror, many weaknesses of intellectuals are exposed, and they clearly realize "that's how I really am." Recognizing oneself also creates conditions for transforming oneself. Thus, the self-important people tuck their tails between their legs in front of the mirror; and when they have personally experienced the practice of labor, personally seen how manual labor is constantly changing the face of nature and the face of society, and their own ideological outlook has also been transformed, they truly realize that engaging in ordinary labor is glorious and worth being proud of. The comrade who was sent down resolutely expressed his obedience to the Party's assignment, not because he had given up his ideals, or because he thought research work was not important, but because he had become more solid from being ambitious and unrealistic, broadened his horizons, and saw that in addition to a certain kind of research work, there are many seemingly ordinary but actually very meaningful jobs. The Party's policy of sending cadres down to labor and train has blossomed and borne fruit in these comrades.

	Several months ago, when I went to visit the comrades who were sent down, they said: "When we return to the office, we will not be scrap iron, but a piece of hard steel!" Now, we have seen the steel tempered in the labor furnace. Naturally, the steel tempered in the labor furnace does not mean that it no longer needs to be tempered. Rather, it must continue to be tempered, while also studying professional skills, to become "talents" who are both red and expert and more useful to the people.

    炼出来了！
    柳笛
    火车一到，一个又一个黑壮的小伙子生龙活虎般从车里跳出来。欢迎的人群拥上去，一把握住手，这手又粗又壮，满是老茧。身体变壮了，脸孔变黑了，白面书生变成了红脸关公，带着热情、朴实的笑容。人们亲切地议论着：“晒黑了！”“长胖了！”“变红了！”……
    我忽然想起机关炼钢时的情景。出第一炉钢的时候，大家焦急地守在炉旁，一看到通红的钢水从炉口流出来，人们禁不住高声叫着：“炼出来了！炼出来了！”
    不错，不错，下放的同志是从劳动的大熔炉里锻炼出来了。手变粗、脸变黑，还只是表面上的变化。更重要的是思想意识、精神面貌变红了。劳动观点和群众观点增强了，阶级观点比以前更坚定、更明确了，知识分子那种自持清高、轻视体力劳动、轻视劳动人民的资产阶级观点发生了显著的变化。在劳动中，对人民群众的智慧和勤劳朴实的优良品质，有了较正确的认识，培养了劳动人民的思想感情。同时也学到了许多生产知识。要说收获，这可算是最重要、最宝贵的收获。
    有人也许不相信：“劳动锻炼果然如此灵验么？”自然，下放的同志并不是一经劳动，每个人的收获都是半斤八两。但，凡是对劳动锻炼有正确的认识，能够认真、自觉地进行劳动锻炼的人，他们在思想意识、立场、观点和作风上发生的变化，都是很快的。我见一位下放归来的同志在组织上分配工作的时候，很诚恳地说：“我一定听党的话，党让我干什么，我就老老实实地干什么，而且钻进去！”这几句话，听来平常。大跃进中，人们的共产主义思想普遍高涨，“党指向哪里，就奔向哪里！”已经成为有觉悟的人们的行动口号。可是，话从这位同志嘴里说出来，而且说得那么恳切，真也不容易。下放以前，他在工作上还常常挑肥捡瘦、轻视平凡的劳动，一心想做高深的、复杂的研究工作；这才一年多的时间，孤芳自赏的知识分子竟然放下架子，有了劳动人民的感情。这一前一后，竟然判若两人。
    下放的同志在农村的时间虽然不长，但是，劳动的实践却无时无刻不在批判着轻视体力劳动的种种错误观念，无时无刻不在检验着知识分子自命不凡的知识。有些看来是很简单的劳动，“四体不勤”的知识分子却显得笨手笨脚，无能为力；有些也许是很浅近的生产知识，“五谷不分”的知识分子却变得知识贫乏束手无策。体力劳动像是一面镜子，在镜子面前一照，知识分子的许多弱点都暴露出来了，清楚地认识到自己“原来如此”。认识了自己，也就为改造自己创造了条件。于是，自命不凡的人在镜子面前也就夹起了尾巴；等到亲身经历了劳动实践，亲眼看见了体力劳动每时每刻地在改变着自然的面貌，改变着社会的面貌，自己的思想面貌也得到了改造，真正认识到从事平凡的劳动是光荣而值得骄傲的事情。那位下放的同志毅然表示服从党的分配，并不是放弃了他的理想，或者是认为研究工作不重要了，而是他由好高鹜远变得坚实起来了，眼界开阔了，看清了除了某一种研究工作之外，还有许多看来平凡其实是很有意义的工作。党的干部下放劳动锻炼的政策，在这些同志身上开花结果了。
    几个月以前，我去探望下放的同志，他们表示：“等回机关的时候，自己将不是一块废铁，而是一块坚硬的钢！”现在，我们已经看到了劳动熔炉中炼出来的钢。自然，劳动熔炉中炼出来的钢，并非不需要再锤炼了。而是要在不断地锤炼中，同时钻研业务，成为对人民更有用的又红又专的“材”。
