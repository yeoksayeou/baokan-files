Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th. TASS reported from Moscow: The "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 20th entitled "The Tricks Played by Western Countries Around the Berlin Issue," criticizing the results of the North Atlantic Group Council's discussion of the Berlin issue.

The commentary said: "The communique of the North Atlantic Group Council first proves that the Western Three are doing everything possible to insist on maintaining the occupied status of Berlin together with the Federal Republic of Germany. The people who drafted the communique claimed that they "cannot agree to a solution that questions the stationing of the United States, Britain, and France in Berlin." These people are clearly trying to preserve the title of "permanent occupiers" for their countries, although the absurdity of this ambition is very obvious in the fourteenth year after the end of the war."

The commentary wrote: Even the Western newspapers do not hide that at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, certain people who play a leading role in this organization used Bonn's desire to exacerbate the situation on the Berlin issue to create an atmosphere of war mania in order to facilitate their obtaining the consent of Western European countries to set up their own atomic rocket bases there.

The commentary emphasized that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has absolutely no right to discuss the Berlin issue and pass resolutions. "It should be known that the Soviet government made suggestions on the Berlin issue to the United States, Britain, and France, that is, to the countries directly related to maintaining the current situation in West Berlin, and not to the headquarters of the North Atlantic Group. When the anti-Hitler allies fought against German fascism to defend the cause of independence of the people of Europe, the North Atlantic Group did not even have a shadow!"

The commentary further pointed out: Now, anyone with eyes to see things very clearly understands that the Soviet government's following view is correct: what Western countries care about is not the freedom and happiness of the residents of West Berlin, but maintaining West Berlin as a military springboard for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to carry out subversive activities and aggression against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other peaceful countries.

The commentary said, when mentioning the various distortions of the Soviet Union's proposals on normalizing the Berlin situation by Western countries, it must be especially pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made great efforts to distort the meaning of the Soviet government's proposals. Dulles, unwilling to use his brain to analyze this proposal, attempted to describe the proposal as an "ultimatum," but then he said: "Military experts are fully convinced that the Soviet Union will not risk launching a war over West Berlin." This kind of argument is really strange. He portrays this "view" as a new discovery. Apparently, it was not until now that the Secretary of State discovered that the Soviet Union does not want war.

The commentary accused Bonn of trying its best to reduce the impact of the Soviet proposals, and said that the Bonn politicians headed by Adenauer consider themselves to represent not the country declared to be the heir to the Hitler Empire, but the country that participated in crushing fascism. Those who have mistaken their identities should remember an ancient Russian proverb: "If you are not a boatman, don't hold the pole."

The commentary emphasized: "The Soviet Union, following the basic principles of its foreign policy, has put forward the path of negotiation, which can achieve success and lead to an agreement among the countries concerned. If it is thought that the Western countries' refusal to seek a path of consultation can hinder the Soviet Union from taking measures that it has previously announced to the countries concerned, then that is a big mistake. The Soviet government has stated more than once that, under any circumstances, it will abandon its obligation to maintain the Berlin occupation regime and will transfer the Soviet side's provisional administrative power to the German Democratic Republic as a sovereign state."

### “真理报”发表评论指出  北大西洋集团无权讨论柏林问题  西方国家的花招不能阻挠苏联采取既定措施

    “真理报”发表评论指出
    北大西洋集团无权讨论柏林问题
    西方国家的花招不能阻挠苏联采取既定措施
    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”20日发表了题为“西方国家围绕柏林问题所玩的花招”的评论，抨击北大西洋集团理事会讨论柏林问题的结果。
    评论说：“北大西洋集团理事会的公报首先证明，西方三国正同德意志联邦共和国一起千方百计地坚持保持柏林的被占领地位。制定公报的人声称，他们“不能够同意使美国、英国和法国在柏林的驻留发生疑问的解决”。这些人显然力图给自己的国家保全“永久占领者”的称号，虽然这种野心的荒谬性在战争结束后的第十四个年头中已是十分明显的了。”
    评论写道：连西方报纸也不隐讳，在北大西洋公约组织会议上，某些在这个组织中起主导作用的人士利用波恩在柏林问题上加剧局势的愿望来制造一种战争狂的气氛，以利于他们取得西欧国家同意在它们那里设置自己的原子火箭基地。
    评论强调说，北大西洋公约组织根本无权讨论柏林问题和通过决议。“要知道，苏联政府是向美国、英国和法国，也就是向与保持西柏林现有局势有直接关系的国家提出关于柏林问题的建议，而不是向北大西洋集团总部提出的。当反希特勒同盟国同德国法西斯作战以捍卫欧洲各国人民的独立事业的时候，北大西洋集团连个影子还没有呢！”
    评论进一步指出：现在，凡是有眼睛能看见事物的人都非常清楚，苏联政府的下面的看法是正确的：西方国家关心的不是西柏林居民的自由和幸福，而是保持西柏林作为北大西洋公约组织的军事跳板来对德意志民主共和国、苏联和其他和平国家进行颠复活动和侵略。
    评论在提到西方国家对苏联关于使柏林局势正常化的建议的百般歪曲时说，必须特别指出，美国国务卿杜勒斯为了歪曲苏联政府建议的意思而大卖力气。杜勒斯不愿动脑筋来分析这个建议，就企图把建议说成是“最后通牒”，但是他又说：“军事专家完全相信，苏联不会由于西柏林而冒发动战争之险”。这种论调真是奇怪。他把这种“看法”描绘成一种新的发现。显然，直到现在，国务卿才发现苏联不希望战争。
    评论指责波恩在千方百计地力图缩小苏联建议的影响，并说，以阿登纳为首的波恩政客自认为他们代表的不是宣布为希特勒帝国继承人的国家，而是参加粉碎法西斯的国家。那些搞错了自己身份的人应当记住一句俄罗斯古代的谚语：“不是撑船手，休掌竹篙头”。
    评论强调说：“苏联正遵循它的外交政策的基本原则提出了谈判的道路，这种谈判可以取得成功，可以导致有关国家取得协议。假如认为西方国家拒绝寻求协商的道路就可以阻挠苏联采取以前它向有关国家所宣布的措施，那就大错而特错了。苏联政府不止一次地声明，无论在什么条件下，它都将放弃它维持柏林占领制度的义务，并且将苏联方面暂行管理权移交给作为主权国家的德意志民主共和国。
