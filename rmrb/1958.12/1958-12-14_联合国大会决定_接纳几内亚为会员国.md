Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th - The United Nations General Assembly plenary session on the 12th admitted the newly independent African country of Guinea as a member state. This action was taken based on the recommendation of the Security Council, which had earlier unanimously approved Guinea's admission to the United Nations.

The President of the United Nations General Assembly, Malik, announced that Guinea became a member of the United Nations "without objection," and the meeting did not conduct a vote.
