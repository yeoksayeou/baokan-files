Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 21st. According to TASS, Berlin: The "Berliner Zeitung" published a message on the 20th entitled "Mollet—A Spy for Hitler's Secret Police," exposing the past treasonous activities of Mollet, the right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party.

The newspaper wrote that if Mollet's experiences are examined chronologically, then his record was already tainted when France was defeated and Mollet was captured by Hitler's army.

Waddell and Otto, who served in a prisoner-of-war camp guard from 1940 to 1943, still live in West Germany. They clearly remember Mollet, who was sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in the summer of 1940 and became the camp's medic. In early 1942, a secret prisoner-of-war organization in the camp was discovered. The participants in this organization included prisoners of war from France, Belgium, Britain, Norway, and Denmark. These people were preparing to riot in the prisoner-of-war camp, and they were all sentenced to death. After this, the guards of the prisoner-of-war camp quickly learned that Mollet had been commended by Hufnagel, the head of Hitler's security agency, who had traveled from Berlin specifically to investigate the matter. At that time, no one suspected that the failure of the secret prisoner organization was directly related to Mollet's commendation, which enabled Mollet to return to Arras (Pas-de-Calais) in France at an early date.

It is also known that after returning to Arras and joining the resistance movement, Mollet betrayed two active participants in the resistance movement, the communists Bodard and Delmer, to Hitler's secret police. These two were hanged on October 2, 1942.

The "Berliner Zeitung" then pointed out that there were other eyewitness testimonies that confirmed Mollet's connection with Hitler's secret police and Hitler's secret agencies during the Second World War. For example, Schaum, a former German secret agency worker who worked in occupied France, provided information that he had met with Mollet in Paris "on instructions."

### 法国社会党领袖原来是卖国叛徒  摩勒当过纳粹间谍  “柏林日报”揭了他的老底子

    法国社会党领袖原来是卖国叛徒
    摩勒当过纳粹间谍
    “柏林日报”揭了他的老底子
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社柏林讯：“柏林日报”20日以“摩勒——希特勒秘密警察的间谍”为题刊载了一条消息，揭露法国社会党右翼领导人摩勒过去的卖国活动。
    报纸写道，如果按年代审查一下摩勒的经历，那么早在法国遭到失败而摩勒被希特勒军队俘虏的时候，他的经历便有了污点。
    1940年到1943年在一个战俘营警卫队供职的瓦戴尔和奥托现在还生活在西德。他们还清楚地记得摩勒，摩勒是在1940年夏天被送到这个战俘营的，并且成了营里的卫生员。1942年初营内一个秘密的战俘组织被发觉，这个组织的参加者包括法国、比利时、英国、挪威和丹麦的一些战俘，这些人准备在战俘营内暴动，他们都被判处了死刑。在这之后，战俘营的守卫队人员很快就知晓，摩勒受到了希特勒保安机关的负责人胡夫纳盖尔的嘉奖，胡夫纳盖尔当时专门为调查这件事从柏林赶到那里。那时没有任何人怀疑，战俘秘密组织的失败同摩勒受到嘉奖一事有着直接联系，正是这种情况使摩勒得以早日返回法国的阿拉斯市（加来海峡省）。
    人们还知道，摩勒在回到阿拉斯市和参加抵抗运动之后，曾向希特勒秘密警察出卖了两个抵抗运动的积极参加者、共产党员博达尔和德勒梅，这两个人在1942年10月2日被处绞刑。
    “柏林日报”接着指出，此外还有其他一些目击者的证词，他们都证实了在第二次世界大战期间摩勒同希特勒秘密警察和希特勒秘密机关有联系。例如，以前在法国沦陷区工作过的德国秘密机关工作人员夏乌姆曾提供情报，说他曾“根据指示”在巴黎同摩勒会过面。
