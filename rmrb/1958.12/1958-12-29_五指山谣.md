Wuzhi Mountain Ballad
	Zhang Yongmei
	Let's sing a song of good fortune! Is it that the earth has grown unicorn horns? Is it that a black dragon has ascended to heaven? Is it that a golden rooster has spread its wings? Quick, sing a song of good fortune! The earth has grown unicorn horns—those are blast furnaces! A black dragon has ascended to heaven—that is smoke! A golden rooster has spread its wings—that is the light of molten iron! Wuzhi Mountain, mountain of good fortune, Wuzhi Mountain everywhere is a sign of good fortune, quick, sing a song of good fortune!
	Beside the coconut tree, a coconut tree on the left, a brother is building a blast furnace on the right. A sister comes under the tree, chewing betel nuts and wearing a flowered skirt. "Toss a betel nut to the sky, the brother eats it and feels sweet in his heart." The brother on the furnace doesn't turn his head, he knocks bricks with his knife and doesn't answer. Not throwing betel nuts, but throwing bricks, the brother gently catches them in his hand. Above and below the furnace they smile at each other, the coconut tree sways a few times.

    五指山谣  
    张永枚
    唱个吉庆的歌吧是大地长了骐麟角吗？是黑龙上了天吗？是金鸡展开翅吗？快唱吉庆的歌吧！大地长了骐麟角，——那是高炉呀。黑龙上了天，——那是煤烟呀。金鸡展开翅，——那是铁水的光芒呀！五指山，吉庆的山，五指山到处是吉庆的兆头，快唱个吉庆的歌吧！
    椰树旁边左边一棵椰树，右边阿哥砌高炉。树下来了阿妹子，口吃槟榔穿花?。“一颗槟榔扔上天，阿哥吃了心里甜。”炉上阿哥不转眼，刀敲砖头没答言。不抛槟榔抛砖头，阿哥轻轻接在手。炉上炉下相对笑，椰树摇几摇。
