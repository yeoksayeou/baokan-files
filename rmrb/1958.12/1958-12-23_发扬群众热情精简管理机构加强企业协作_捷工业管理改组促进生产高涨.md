Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 22nd—The restructuring of industrial management in Czechoslovakia, implemented since April 1st this year, has played a positive role in the development of industrial production this year and created favorable conditions for completing socialist construction ahead of schedule.

Due to this measure mobilizing the positive factors in the national economy and adjusting certain aspects of work that were no longer adapted to today's situation, Czechoslovakia's industrial production this year will exceed the original plan by 3%, and the total industrial output value next year is also expected to increase by 5 billion crowns, with production profits increasing by 1.5 billion crowns.

The main feature of the industrial management restructuring is to improve the political and production enthusiasm of enterprises and the working people. The restructured economic production units have obtained greater rights in management, planning, and finance than before. Therefore, they can better plan production, arrange tasks, improve technology, expand equipment, and tap potential according to specific conditions, which significantly improves labor productivity.

The working masses, encouraged by further participation in the leadership and management of production and by the policy of improving living standards on the basis of developing production, have shown high enthusiasm and have made miracles that were previously unimaginable. For example, departments such as coal, heavy machinery manufacturing, capital construction, and transportation have changed their original backward state this year and joined the ranks of the advanced.

In order to improve production efficiency, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government abolished the administrative bureaus at the management headquarters level, streamlined about 50% of the industrial management personnel, and united or merged the original more than 1,000 factories and enterprises into more than 300 production units. After such adjustments, the leadership is closer to production, work efficiency has been greatly improved, and cooperation between enterprises has been strengthened. The central ministries can also free themselves from daily affairs and concentrate on key measures. For example, the Ministry of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing used to handle hundreds of inter-enterprise relationship issues every year, while this year it only needs to solve twenty-eight issues related to enterprise production targets.

Production meetings and technical and economic meetings have become an effective organizational form for promoting enterprise democracy in current factories and enterprises, and production meetings are often held in factories, workshops, and work teams. This type of meeting can concentrate the wisdom of the workers to eliminate difficulties and shortcomings in the work, and propose suggestions and measures to improve production. Technical and economic meetings are conducted at a higher level. It discusses the production and organizational problems of the entire factory and also solves scientific and technological problems with the help of scientific workers.

The entire industrial restructuring was prepared and carried out under the direct leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, adopting a mass line approach. Before the restructuring plan was implemented, it underwent a nationwide discussion, absorbed the beneficial suggestions of the working people, explained and criticized various incorrect opinions, and achieved ideological unity among the people of the country. The complex and meticulous restructuring work was also carried out on the basis of mobilizing the masses, concentrating a large number of experienced party, economic, and political workers to work together. This makes the industrial restructuring not only of great economic significance, but also of important political significance.

The industrial restructuring in Czechoslovakia has just begun. After the implementation of the planning and financial work restructuring next year, the superiority of the industrial restructuring will be more fully demonstrated. Nevertheless, the role it can play in improving the effectiveness of the national economy has been clearly demonstrated by the comprehensive surge in industrial production in this country over the past six months.

    捷工业管理改组促进生产高涨
    新华社布拉格22日电  从今年4月1日开始实施的捷克斯洛伐克工业管理改组对今年工业生产的发展起了良好的作用，并为提前建成社会主义创造了有利条件。
    由于这一措施调动了国民经济中的积极因素，调整了工作中某些已不能适应今天形势的环节，今年捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产将超额3％完成原定计划，明年工业总产值也预计增加五十亿克朗，生产利润提高十五亿克朗。
    工业管理改组的主要特点是提高了企业和劳动人民的政治与生产积极性。改组后的经济生产单位在管理、计划和财务方面都获得了比以前更大的权利，因而能更好地根据具体情况来计划生产、安排任务、改进技术、扩充设备和挖掘潜力，使劳动生产率显著提高。
    工人群众由于进一步参加了生产的领导和管理，并为在发展生产基础上提高生活水平的方针所鼓舞，因而热情高涨，做出了以前难以想像的奇迹。如煤炭、重型机械制造、基本建设和运输等部门今年都改变了原来的落后状况，加入到先进者的行列里了。
    为了提高生产效率，捷共和政府撤消了管理总局一级的机构，精简了约50％的工业管理人员，将原有的一千多个工厂企业联合或合并成三百多个生产单位。经过这样的调整，领导更接近生产，工作效率大大提高，企业间的协作加强了，中央各部也可以从日常事务中抽身出来，集中力量抓关键性措施。例如，重型机器制造部过去每年要亲自处理成百件的企业间的关系问题，而今年它只需要解决二十八个有关企业生产指标的问题。
  生产会议和技术经济会议已成为当前工厂企业中一种有效的发扬企业民主的组织形式，工厂、车间和工作队中都经常举行生产会议。这种会议可以集中工人群众的智慧来消除工作中的困难与缺点，提出改进生产的建议和措施。技术经济会议则在较高的水平上进行，它讨论全厂的生产与组织问题，也在科学工作者协助下解决有关科学技术的问题。
    整个工业改组的工作是在捷共直接领导下、采取群众路线的方式来准备和进行的。改组方案在付诸实施前，经过了全民性的讨论，吸收了劳动人民的有益建议，解释和批判了各种不正确的意见，取得了全国人民思想上的一致。复杂细致的改组工作也是在发动群众的基础上，集中了大批有经验的党、经济和政治工作者来共同进行的。这就使得工业改组不仅具有巨大的经济意义，而且具有重要的政治意义。
    捷克斯洛伐克的工业改组还刚开始，到明年计划和财务工作的改组实施后，工业改组的优越性将更充分发挥出来。尽管如此，它对提高国民经济效果所能发挥的作用已由半年来这个国家的工业生产的全面高涨清楚地显示出来了。
