Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 11th: The broad masses of the Iraqi people and the army unanimously support the Republic government headed by Qassem in suppressing the subversive conspiracy.

The commander of the Iraqi Army's First Division sent a telegram to Prime Minister Qassem, saying: "The conspiracy that was buried before it could even be launched is a conspiracy by imperialism against our Republic. The First Division reiterates its guarantee to dedicate our lives to our people, our land, and our Republic, and under your firm leadership, unite and work to eradicate imperialism and their agents."

All division commanders of the Iraqi army have expressed their loyalty to the Republic and their determination to defend it. Commanders of the artillery units, the newly appointed Inspector General of Police, and the Commander of the People's Resistance Army have also sent similar telegrams expressing their loyalty.

At the same time, tens of thousands of people telegraphed the government, newspapers, and radio stations, expressing their support for the government.

The chairman of the Bar Association said in a telegram that lawyers "will continue to be staunch supporters of the Republic." The telegram called for resolute action against the conspirators.

More than 15,000 women in Baghdad sent a petition to the Prime Minister, expressing their firm opposition to the visit of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree to Iraq and demanding severe punishment for the conspirators.

On the 9th, mass demonstrations were held in Nasiriyah, a southern province of Iraq, in support of Prime Minister Qassem's actions against the conspiracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 12th: The Iraqi Peace Committee issued a statement this morning on the newly uncovered conspiracy case in Iraq, saying, "The peace fighters of Iraq, like all peace-loving people in the world, recognize that the Iraqi revolution destroyed the largest base for imperialism to plot conspiracies in Arab countries, and destroyed the enemies of peace. Therefore, establishing our beloved Republic is the most important factor in consolidating peace in this region."

The statement said, "It is clear that any conspiracy and attempt to destroy this Republic is not only a national betrayal but also creates the most favorable conditions for the imperialists to re-enslave our country and turn it into a base for war preparations."

The statement concluded with a vehement condemnation of the conspiracy and called on the Iraqi people to unite around their democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 12th: In a commentary on the newly uncovered conspiracy case in Iraq, the Iraqi Republic Radio said on the evening of the 11th that this measure by the government satisfied all those who defend the Republic. The patriotic forces and the heroic army of the Iraqi people demonstrated close unity. They unanimously condemned this conspiracy. This frightened the imperialists and conspirators.

The radio said that this conspiracy case was not accidental. The Iraqi revolution destroyed a strong fortress of imperialism, ended imperialism's control over Iraq forever, cut off the evil claws of imperialism, prevented it from using Iraq as a springboard to attack the anti-imperialist Arab national liberation movement, and threatened all peace-loving people. The Iraqi revolution ignited the flames of revolution in the hearts of the heroic Arabs, inspiring their revolutionary fighting spirit.

The radio then said that the Iraqi Republic formulated its foreign policy based on the demands of free Arab nationalism, established the best and most solid relations with free Arab countries and the heroic Arab people, cooperated friendly with all countries that are not hostile to us, and supported the national independence struggles of all countries. The Iraqi Republic also formulated its domestic policy based on the demands of the people, established the great unity of the Arab-Kurdish nationalities, and carried out economic and social reforms. The cornerstone of the feudal system is beginning to collapse. The foundation of the Iraqi Republic is becoming increasingly consolidated. This brought the dissatisfaction of the imperialist bloc to its peak. Therefore, their radio stations and newspapers constantly attacked and slandered the policies of the Iraqi Republic. Imperialism constantly plots new conspiracies.

The radio pointed out that imperialism is walking down a dead end, and if they continue to sink in the dead pit without extricating themselves, it will only accelerate the collapse of the imperialist system. Military threats and sending representatives on suspicious visits will absolutely not save imperialism. The Iraqi people are determined to move forward.

    伊拉克人民支持政府镇压颠复阴谋
    军队将领致电卡塞姆表示决心保卫共和国
    新华社巴格达11日电  伊拉克广大人民和军队一致支持以卡塞姆为首的共和国政府镇压颠复阴谋。
    伊拉克陆军第一师师长打电报给卡塞姆总理说：“最近未及发动就被埋葬的阴谋是帝国主义反对我们共和国的阴谋。第一师重申保证为我们的人民、国土和共和国献出我们的生命，在你的坚定领导下，团结一致为铲除帝国主义和他们的代理人而努力。”
    伊拉克军队所有各个师的师长都已经表示忠于共和国和保卫共和国。炮兵部队司令，新任命的警察总监，人民抵抗军司令等也发出了同样的表示效忠的电报。
    同时，成千上万的人民拍电报给政府或报纸和广播电台，表示支持政府。
    律师协会主席在电报中说，律师们“将继续是共和国的忠实支持者。”电报要求对阴谋分子采取坚决行动。
    巴格达一万五千多名妇女在送给总理的请愿书中，表示坚决反对美国助理国务卿朗特里到伊拉克访问，并要求严惩阴谋犯。
    9日，在伊拉克南部省份纳西里亚，群众举行了大规模的示威，支持卡塞姆总理对这次阴谋所采取的行动。
    新华社巴格达12日电  伊拉克和平委员会今天上午就伊拉克新破获的阴谋案发表声明说，“伊拉克的和平战士像世界上所有爱好和平的人士一样，认识到伊拉克的革命摧毁了帝国主义在阿拉伯国家策划阴谋的最大基地，并且摧毁了反对和平的敌人。因此确立我们这个可爱的共和国是巩固这个地区的和平的最重要因素。”
    声明说，“很明显，任何想要摧毁这个共和国的阴谋和企图，不仅是民族的叛徒，而且也是为帝国主义者制造最有利的条件，使他们能以把我国重新置于奴役之下，并且使这个国家变成备战的基地。”
    声明最后激烈地谴责了这次阴谋，并且号召伊拉克人民团结在他们的民主政府周围。
    新华社巴格达12日电  伊拉克共和国电台11日晚上在评论伊拉克新破获的阴谋案时说，政府的这一措施使一切保卫共和国的人们感到满意。伊拉克人民的爱国力量和英勇的陆军表现了紧密的团结。他们一致谴责这一阴谋。这使帝国主义和阴谋者感到恐惧。
    电台说，这个阴谋案不是偶然的。伊拉克革命摧毁了帝国主义的一个坚强堡垒，永远结束了帝国主义对伊拉克的控制，斩断了帝国主义的魔掌，使它不能以伊拉克作为跳板来进攻反帝的阿拉伯民族解放运动，威胁一切爱好和平的人民。伊拉克革命在英勇的阿拉伯人心中燃起了革命的火焰，振奋着他们的革命斗志。
    电台接着说，伊拉克共和国从自由阿拉伯民族主义的要求出发制定了它的对外政策，同自由阿拉伯国家和英勇的阿拉伯人民建立了最良好和最巩固的关系，同一切不敌视我们的国家友好合作，并且支持各国人民的民族独立斗争。伊拉克共和国并且从人民的要求出发制定了它的对内政策，建立阿拉伯—库尔德民族的大团结，并且进行了经济和社会改革。封建制度的基石在开始崩溃。伊拉克共和国的根基日趋巩固。这使帝国主义集团的不满达到了顶点。于是，它们的电台和报纸对伊拉克共和国的政策不断地进行攻击和诬蔑。帝国主义不断策划新阴谋。
    电台指出，但是，帝国主义走的是死胡同，它们如果要在死坑中继续下陷而不肯自拔，那适足以加速帝国主义体系的崩溃。军事威胁和派代表进行可疑的访问旅行绝对挽救不了帝国主义。伊拉克人民决心向前迈进。（附图片）
