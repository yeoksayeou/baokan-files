An Important Link in Improving "Small Indigenous Groups"
Hunan Actively Improves Living Conditions for the Steel Army

(Our newspaper, Changsha, 12th dispatch) The Hunan provincial party committees at all levels are highly concerned about the "small indigenous groups" of steel workers, and are constantly improving their production and living conditions to ensure that they eat well, live well, and rest well, so that everyone is in a good mood and full of energy.

Since the beginning of winter, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed in every meeting that caring for the lives of the "small indigenous groups" of steel workers should be regarded as an important part of consolidating, reorganizing, and improving the steel "small indigenous groups." The You County Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by the county party secretary, established a "Life and Welfare Committee for Iron Smelting Workers of Small Indigenous Groups." Each commune and nine old iron factories in the county were equipped with a party secretary or a party committee member to specifically manage the lives of the workers. All 498 rain gear factories in the county produced more than 70,000 bamboo hats, 30,000 raincoats, and 140,000 pairs of winter straw shoes for the workers. 156 sewing processing factories and groups rushed to produce 4,000 cotton quilts, 10,000 cotton clothes, and 30,000 cotton hats. The county's eleven purchasing and marketing departments entered factories and went up mountains to supply a large number of galoshes, gloves, and scarves. All medical stations added a large number of anti-freeze medicines. 520 public canteens often prepared hot dishes, hot meals, and hot water for workers working outdoors. The county party committee also mobilized the masses to voluntarily vacate 2,365 houses for the workers.

Party and government leading cadres of factories, mines, and workshops at all levels eat, live, and work with the workers, discover problems in a timely manner, and solve problems. The Jinjiang Mine Party Committee in Ningxiang County set up the headquarters in the work area. All cadres lived in the same dormitory and ate at the same table as the workers. Most of the cadres went down the well, carried and transported, and worked the night shift with the workers. Party Secretary Peng Jihe, Mine Manager Li Guozhang, and others also inspected everywhere late at night to cover the workers with quilts. The Party Committee of the Hongqi Iron Factory in Xinhua County also regularly organized comfort groups and life inspection groups to go deep into the workshops and mines to help workers solve life problems. Female worker Lu Xiutao said with emotion: "I am determined to settle down in the factory and fight for steel for the rest of my life."

Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the broad masses of commune members of the people's communes are actively helping workers improve their lives. The people's communes in Lianyuan County have drawn a large number of semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers to form professional groups for straw shoes, needlework, laundry, cleaning and hygiene, and hairdressing to serve the workers very well. The Party Committee of the Qiaotouhe Commune issued five "treasures" to the workers: glasses, safety helmets, gloves, foot covers, and aprons, and also trained 300 health workers to provide medical care for the workers. Factories with good conditions also established factory hospitals.

Steel workers in various places are also relying on their own efforts to improve their lives. Employees of the Henglong Iron Factory in Yiyang County used their spare time to plant 2.9 million cabbages and raise 90 pigs, achieving self-sufficiency in vegetables and oil in December, and eating pork once every half a month. With the support of the local people's commune, the workers of the Jinjiang Coal Mine in Ningxiang County built 18 new dormitories, 39 public toilets, and 15 bathhouses without spending a penny, so that all workers could sleep in new dormitories that did not leak, were not ventilated, and were not damp.

While improving the material lives of the workers, party committees at all levels also strive to make the cultural lives of the workers rich and colorful. The Fengping Iron Factory of the Dongfanghong Commune in Lianyuan County established a club for the workers, and the masses and cadres donated more than 10,000 books, dozens of newspapers, various musical instruments and other entertainment supplies. This allowed the workers to sing to their heart's content and rest happily after work. The party secretary and factory director of the Steel Plant in the suburbs of Xiangtan City took the lead in mobilizing 400 people to work part-time and built a large playground 30 meters long and 28 meters wide, built a basketball court, a high jump and long jump pool, and also a high jump frame. The factory also organized a 100-member cultural troupe. The workers proposed: the cultural troupe should catch up with professional troupes; in terms of sports, more than 300 employees should pass the labor and defense system by the end of the year.

Due to the good arrangements for the lives of the workers, new situations have generally emerged in production in various places. For example, the Xiangxiang Bayi Iron Factory achieved "ten goods" in life (eating, living, sleeping, wearing, learning, resting, entertaining, caring for the sick, taking care of family members, and military training). The workers were full of energy, and the furnace output increased from an average daily output of 300 jin to 8,077 jin, and the output of ore sand also quadrupled. The number of employees who can master the complete set of technology has increased to about 300, and the workers have contributed a total of 5,586 large and small strategies in the technical innovation movement. The attendance rate has increased from the original 70% to 95%.

    提高“小土群”的重要一环
    湖南积极改善钢铁大军生活条件
    本报长沙12日电  湖南省级各党委高度关心“小土群”钢铁工人，不断为他们改善生产和生活条件，保证吃好、住好、休息好，做到人人心情舒畅，干劲冲天。
    入冬以来，中共湖南省委在历次会议上都提出，要把关心“小土群”钢铁工人的生活，当作整顿、巩固和提高钢铁“小土群”的一个重要环节。中共攸县县委以县委书记为首，成立了“小土群炼铁工人生活福利委员会”，全县各公社和九个老铁厂都配备了一个党委书记或党委委员专管工人生活。全县四百九十八个雨具工厂为工人生产了七万多顶斗笠，三万件蓑衣，十四万双冬用草鞋；一百五十六个缝纫加工厂、组赶制出棉被四千床，棉衣一万件，棉帽三万顶。全县十一个购销部进厂、上山，供应了大批套鞋、手套和围巾；各医疗站添制了大批防冻药品；五百二十个公共食堂经常为外出工人准备热菜、热饭和热水。县委还动员群众自动为工人让出了二千三百六十五间住房。
    各地厂、矿、车间的党政领导干部，都和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，及时发现问题，解决问题。宁乡县靳江矿党委把指挥部设在工区，所有干部和工人同宿舍、同桌吃饭，绝大部分干部和工人同下井、同挑运、同出晚班。党委书记彭集和、矿长李国章等，每天还深更半夜四处检查，给工人盖被子。新化县红旗铁厂党委还经常组织慰问团、生活检查团，深入车间、矿井帮助工人解决生活问题。女工陆秀桃感动地说：“我决心在厂里安家落户，一辈子为钢铁而战。”
    在各级党委领导下，人民公社社员等广大群众，都在积极帮助工人改善生活。涟源县各人民公社都抽出大批半劳力和辅助劳动力，组成草鞋、针线洗衣、清洁卫生、理发等专业组，为工人服务得很好。桥头河公社党委发给工人五件“宝”：眼镜、安全帽、手套、脚罩、围裙，还训练了三百名卫生员，为工人医疗，条件好的地方还成立了工厂医院。
    各地钢铁工人也在自力更生，自己动手改善生活。益阳县衡龙铁厂职工利用空隙时间，栽种白菜二百九十万棵，喂养生猪九十头，12月做到菜、油自给，半月吃一餐猪肉。宁乡县靳江煤矿职工在当地人民公社支援下，没花一文钱，新建了十八栋宿舍，三十九间公共厕所，十五处洗澡堂，使全体工人睡上了不漏雨、不透风、不潮湿的新宿舍。
    各级党委在改善工人物质生活的同时，还尽力使工人的文化生活做到丰富多采。涟源县东方红公社枫坪铁厂，为工人成立了一个俱乐部，由群众、干部捐集了一万多册图书、几十种报纸，还有各种乐器和其他娱乐用品。使工人们在劳动以后都能尽情地歌唱，愉快地休息。湘潭市郊区钢铁厂的党委书记、厂长带头，发动四百人业余劳动，修了一个长三十公尺、宽二十八公尺的大操场，建了篮球场、跳高跳远池，还有跳高架。厂里还组织了一百人的文工团。工人们提出：文工团要赶专业剧团；体育方面，年底要有三百多名职工通过劳卫制。
    各地由于安排好工人生活，生产中普遍出现了新面貌。例如，湘乡八一铁厂做到生活“十好”（吃、住、睡、穿、学习、休息、娱乐、关心病人、照料家属、军事训练），工人干劲充足，炉产量由原来平均日产三百斤提高到八千零七十七斤，矿砂产量也翻了四番。全厂职工能掌握全套技术的人增加到三百人左右，工人们在技术革新运动中已献出大小计策五千五百八十六条，出勤率由原来的70％增加到95％。
