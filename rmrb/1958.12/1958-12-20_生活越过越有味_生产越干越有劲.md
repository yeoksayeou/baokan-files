    Life Gets More Interesting, Production Gets More Energetic
    Hong'an County Implements Work-Rest System, People Rest Well, Have High Morale, and High Efficiency
    Boxing County Launches "Four Visits" Campaign to Run Canteens Well and Arrange Wintering Quickly and Well
    (Our Newspaper Wuhan, December 19th) To rhythmically combine labor and rest, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, has recently implemented a work-rest system throughout the county.
    This year, in the process of striving for a great leap forward in production in Hong'an County, to reduce the labor intensity of the masses, the county has basically achieved the ball bearingization of transportation tools. At the same time, many places have also adopted the method of combining shock work with recuperation, so that the masses can get rest. However, some places have unilaterally adopted the practice of working overtime, which has resulted in complaints from the masses, low labor efficiency, and slow production progress. To change this situation and enable the broad masses to work well, rest well, study well, and enjoy themselves, the Hong'an County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has implemented a work-rest system throughout the county, which is, under normal circumstances, an eight-hour work day, eight hours of sleep, four hours for meals and rest, two hours of study, and two hours of entertainment. At the same time, it also stipulates two days off each month.
    This decision has been warmly supported by the vast number of cadres and the masses. However, some cadres believe that the tasks are heavy and the labor force is small, and if the rest system is implemented, the tasks will not be completed. In response to this situation, the Hong'an County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed party committees at all levels to conscientiously implement the system, while at the same time setting an example in basic production units to educate and criticize some of the cadres' erroneous views. For example, after the Wufenggang Production Team of the Jihua Brigade of the Jiansu People's Commune implemented the eight-hour work system, everyone's enthusiasm became more vigorous, and labor efficiency increased more than doubled compared to the past. The masses generally reflected: "Working day and night only does half the work, while implementing eight hours doubles the efficiency." Another example is the Gaofeng Brigade of the Bali People's Commune, which used to be relatively backward in production, but after conscientiously implementing the work-rest system, the broad masses had time to study, study technology, and vigorously carry out tool reforms, which quickly improved labor efficiency. Both winter planting and steel production were completed very well. Party organizations at all levels seized these facts and, through extensive airing of views, debates, and big-character posters, made everyone realize that only with adequate rest can the masses be more energetic, labor efficiency be higher, and tasks be completed better.
    While implementing the work-rest system, Hong'an County also paid attention to improving labor management and reforming tools. According to statistics, out of the 397 production teams in the county, 229 have implemented labor quotas and improved labor organization, and have created and reformed 46 kinds of tools with a total of more than 6,200 pieces. As a result, the labor attendance rate has been greatly improved. In the past, the number of people working in the county every day was only more than 170,000, but now it has increased to more than 200,000, and the labor efficiency is high. Taking the Jihua Brigade of the Jiansu Commune as an example, in the past, 1,230 people participated in sowing wheat, and they could only sow 125 mu per day. Later, due to the implementation of the work-rest system and the improvement of labor management, more than 1,350 people sowed more than 290 mu of wheat per day, and labor efficiency increased more than doubled.
    Due to the implementation of the work-rest system, the study and entertainment activities of the broad masses have become more rich and colorful. The county has built more than 600 clubs, 59 cultural and art troupes, more than 600 singing teams, and more than 400 libraries. The number of people participating in the Red and Expert School has also increased. Many communes have ensured that wherever there is labor, there is study and entertainment.
    Based on the results of this period of implementation, the people of this county believe that the work-rest system has eight major benefits: (1) Adequate rest, vigorous spirit, and energetic work; (2) Work and rest have time, the starting and ending of work are neat, and time is not wasted; (3) Labor has time, life is organized, and physical health is promoted; (4) There is entertainment, the mood is happy, and the labor mood is high; (5) There is time to study and study technology; (6) There is time to study culture and theory, and improve cultural level and ideological level; (7) Can plan and guide production, avoid downtime and confusion; (8) Cadres have more time to consider work, contact the masses, and reduce and avoid subjectivism and commandism.
    (Our Newspaper) Jinan News - Since the end of November and the middle of December, Boxing County, Shandong Province, from the county party secretary and township party secretary to the branch secretaries of each cultivation zone and production team, have all taken action to organize more than 1,500 visiting groups to carry out a "Four Visits" campaign to visit the people's commune's public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and commune members' families, and quickly and comprehensively arranged the lives of the masses, making the masses' enthusiasm doubled.
    The focus of the visit was on commune members' eating, clothing, winter heating, and arrangements for labor and rest. The visit adopted the method of asking, looking, listening, conveying, researching, and solving problems at the same time. Many people also personally went to the canteen to serve as stewards and managers to help the cooks cook. In this way, problems were discovered quickly and solved specifically and thoroughly. For example, Commune member Cui Mingyuan's brother in the Hubin People's Commune was sick and could not eat in the canteen. Although the canteen delivered food to him on time for every meal, it did not suit the patient's taste. This time, the comrades who visited him went to his home to see the doctor, discovered this problem, and reminded the cadres of the production team that under the principle of the large collective, it is also necessary to pay attention to the special problems of commune members and provide them with convenience. Therefore, it was decided to issue each commune member some rice, carrots, and firewood every month for commune members to use flexibly. The sick commune member was also given some rice from the canteen. In the past, the Third Cultivation Zone of the Gaocheng People's Commune was very slow in arranging heating for commune members, and the commune leadership could not figure out the reason. After the visit, it was discovered that this area did not know how to make briquettes. Therefore, the commune leadership immediately organized the cadres of each company in the area to go to the commune factory to study. The county also held 78 on-site meetings through this visit to promote various good experiences.
    From the end of November to the first ten days of this month, the county visited a total of 1,810 public canteens, 225 homes for the elderly, 935 nurseries, more than 10,000 commune member families, and more than 46,000 commune members. Through this visit, some of the most pressing problems in the lives of the masses have been arranged and resolved. By December 8, more than 95% of the public canteens in the county had established restaurants, ensuring that the rice was hot, the dishes were hot, and the soup was hot. Most canteens have changed the monotonous phenomenon of the menu, making the food more diverse. The people's communes throughout the county have prepared more than 60 million catties of straw and firewood for commune members to use for winter heating, prepared more than 9,600 cotton-padded clothes and quilts for commune members with difficult lives, and many communes have also installed heated kang and stoves for commune members. In addition, a work-rest system has also been established.
    After the lives of the masses were more comprehensively resolved and arranged, the morale of the masses was greatly encouraged, and the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. Many commune members greeted the cadres from afar when they came and insisted on pulling the cadres to their homes to sit and chat, as intimate as a family. Before this, the daily progress of plowing the land in the county was only 3,000 mu, and topdressing was 6,000 mu. Recently, the daily plowing has increased to 5,000-6,000 mu, and topdressing is about 10,000 mu.

    生活越过越有味  生产越干越有劲
    红安县贯彻执行作息制度，群众休息好、干劲足、效率高
    博兴县开展“四访”活动，办好食堂、安排过冬又快又好
    本报武汉19日电  为了把劳动和休息有节奏地结合起来，湖北省红安县最近在全县范围内推行了作息制度。
    红安县今年在争取生产大跃进的过程中，为了减轻群众的劳动强度，全县基本上实现了运输工具滚珠轴承化。和这同时，许多地方还采取了突击与休整相结合的方法，使群众得到休息。但是，也有些地方片面地采取加班加点的做法，结果是，群众有意见，劳动效率低，生产进展慢。为了改变这一状况，使广大群众做到劳动好，休息好，学习好，娱乐好，中共红安县委在全县推行了作息制度，即在一般情况下实行八小时劳动，八小时睡觉，四小时吃饭休息，二小时学习和二小时娱乐的制度；同时还规定了每月放假两天。
    这一决定受到了广大干部和群众的热烈拥护。但是，有些干部认为任务大，劳力少，如果执行休息制度，就完不成任务。根据这一情况，中共红安县委一面责成各级党委认真贯彻执行，一面在基层生产单位首先作出样子，教育和批判部分干部的一些错误看法。例如，建苏人民公社吉花大队五丰岗生产队实行八小时工作制以后，大家的干劲更加旺盛，劳动效率比过去提高了一倍多。群众普遍反映：“日夜加班干，只做活一半，实行八小时，效率翻一番。”再如，八里人民公社高峰大队，过去生产比较落后，但是在认真贯彻作息制度以后，广大群众有时间学习，钻研技术，大搞工具改革，迅速地提高了劳动效率，冬播和钢铁生产都完成得很出色。各级党组织抓住这些事实，通过大鸣大放大辩论，使大家认识到：只有休息好，群众劲头更大，劳动效率更高，任务才完成得更好。
    红安县在贯彻执行作息制度的同时，还注意改善劳动管理，改革工具。据统计，全县三百九十七个中队，实行劳动定额，改善劳动组织的就达二百二十九个，并且创造和改革各种工具四十六种共六千二百多件。这样一来，就大大地提高了劳动出勤率。过去这个县每天出勤的人数只有十七万多人，现在增加到二十万人以上，而且劳动效率高。以建苏公社吉花大队为例，过去参加播种小麦的有一千二百三十人，每天只能播种一百二十五亩，后来，由于贯彻了作息制度，改善了劳动管理，一千三百五十多人每天种小麦达到了二百九十多亩，劳动效率提高了一倍多。
    由于作息制度的贯彻执行，广大群众的学习和娱乐活动更加丰富多彩了。全县已经建俱乐部六百多个，文工团五十九个，歌咏队六百多个，图书室四百多个。参加红专学校学习的群众也增多了。许多公社都做到了哪里有劳动，哪里就有学习和娱乐。
    经过这一段的执行结果来看，这个县的群众认为作息制度有八大好处：（1）休息好了，精神充沛，做活有劲；（2）作息有时间，出工收工整齐，不浪费时间；（3）劳动有时间，生活有条理，促进身体健康；（4）有娱乐，心情愉快，劳动情绪高；（5）有时间学习、钻研技术；（6）有时间学习文化、理论，提高文化水平思想水平；（7）能有计划地指导生产，避免窝工、混乱现象；（8）干部有更多的时间考虑工作，联系群众，减少和避免主观主义和强迫命令作风。
    本报讯  山东博兴县自11月底到12月中旬，从县委书记、乡党委书记到各耕作区、生产队的支部书记全部行动起来，组织了一千五百多个访问组，开展了一次访问人民公社的公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院、社员家庭的“四访”活动，迅速而比较全面地安排了群众生活，使群众干劲倍增。
    访问的重点是社员的吃饭、穿衣、冬季取暖和劳动与休息的安排等问题。访问中采取了边问、边看、边听、边传、边研究、边解决的方法，许多人还亲自到食堂当司务长、管理员，帮助炊事员做饭。这样，使问题发现得快，而且解决的具体彻底。例如，湖滨人民公社社员崔明远的哥哥病了，不能到食堂吃饭，食堂虽然每顿都按时给他送饭，但却不合病人的口味。这次，访问的同志到他家去看病，发现了这个问题，提醒了社队的干部，认识到在大集体的原则下，还必须注意社员的特殊问题，给社员以方便。于是决定每月发给每个社员一些大米、胡萝卜、烧柴，供社员机动使用。这位生病的社员，也由食堂里发给他一些大米。高城人民公社第三耕作区以前对社员取暖问题安排的很迟缓，社的领导上也摸不清是什么原因。经过访问才发现这个区不会制造煤球，于是公社领导立即组织该区各连队干部到公社工厂去学习。全县还通过这次的访问，召开了七十八次现场会议，推广各种好经验。
    从11月底到本月上旬的十几天中，全县共访问了一千八百一十个公共食堂、二百二十五座敬老院、九百三十五所托儿所、一万多户社员家庭和四万六千多名社员。通过这次访问，使群众生活中一些最迫切的问题得到安排和解决。到12月8日为止，全县有95％以上的公共食堂都建立了餐厅，作到了饭热、菜热、汤热，大多数食堂改变了饭菜单调现象，作到了饭菜多样化。全县的各人民公社已准备了六千多万斤供社员过冬取暖用的烧草、烧柴，为生活困难的社员准备了九千六百多件棉衣棉被，不少公社还为社员们盘上卧炕和火炉子；此外还建立了作息制度。
    在群众的生活得到比较全面的解决和安排以后，群众情绪大受鼓舞，干部和群众的关系更密切了。许多社员见了干部来，老远的就打招呼，硬拉着干部到他们家去坐坐，亲热得像一家人一样。这以前，全县翻地每日进度只有三千亩，追肥六千亩，最近每日翻地已增加到五、六千亩，追肥万亩左右。
