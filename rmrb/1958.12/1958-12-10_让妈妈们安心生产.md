    Let Mothers Produce with Peace of Mind

    "How capable can a sixteen or seventeen-year-old child be? How can they take good care of children?" Four years ago, when I started preparing to set up a nursery, some mothers held such distrustful attitudes towards me. When I heard this, my heart turned cold, and I thought about giving up. However, I also thought that mothers carrying their children to production not only reduced efficiency but also affected the health of both children and mothers. As a member of the Youth League, how could I succumb to difficulties? Therefore, I resolved to continue mobilizing the masses in depth and dispel the mothers' worries. After a period of arduous mobilization work, the first batch of children registered for nursery care numbered twelve.

    To find a location, I and several young women scoured the entire village before finding a dilapidated house that had been unoccupied for a long time. This house was very damp, and weeds grew everywhere inside and outside. I mobilized several women to clean and repair it and even painted it myself. Having a house, we then lacked supplies. So, we looked for substitutes, such as taking large and small incense burners used for worship, disinfecting them, and using them to hold children's urine and as spittoons. Lacking bed boards for the children to sleep on, I took out my own bed board. This inspired others, and the masses gradually lent out some bed boards. Everything in the nursery was solved with thrifty methods.

    When the children first entered the nursery, the mothers would secretly watch outside the windows to see if their children were crying and how the caregivers were taking care of their children. But we, like taking care of our own younger siblings, would help the children put on clothes when they were cold, patiently coax them when they cried, and give them toys to play with. The mothers were very satisfied when they saw this. We also thought: How can we make the children healthier and more active, so that mothers can produce with peace of mind? After research, we decided to first do a good job in sanitation. We established some sanitary rules: such as disinfecting the children's towels, teacups, bowls, and chopsticks with boiling water every morning, washing the floor once every three days, doing a major cleaning every seven days, sprinkling bleaching powder or creosol once every three days, and cultivating children's habits of not defecating or urinating indiscriminately, etc. At first, some older caregivers in the nursery were not used to it, so I and caregiver Xia Meilan took the lead in implementing these rules. After persisting for a period, other caregivers followed suit. In the past four years, because the sanitary rules have been well implemented, the children have grown up healthy and lovely. In addition, whenever seasonal infectious diseases are prevalent, we take timely preventive measures. In the past three years, no infectious diseases have occurred in our nursery, and the number of children has gradually increased, now reaching forty-five children and four caregivers.

    In the past four years, I have put all my energy and time into the work of the nursery. I feel that this is a noble cause and a glorious position. Those who look down on childcare work are the ones who are insignificant.

    让妈妈们安心生产
    “十六、七岁的娃娃能有多大的本领，怎能带好孩子？”四年前，当我开始筹办托儿所时，有的母亲对我抱着这样不信任的态度。我当时听了这话，心就冷了半截，想不干。但是，我又想到母亲们背孩子去生产，不但效率不高，而且对儿童和母亲的健康都有影响，自己是个青年团员，怎能向困难低头呢？于是，我决心继续深入发动群众，解除母亲们的顾虑。经过一番艰苦的动员工作之后，第一批报名入托的孩子有十二个。
    为了找所址，我同几个女青年，走遍了全村才找到一间久无人居住的破房子。这间屋很潮湿，屋内外杂草丛生，我就发动几个妇女进行打扫和修理，并自己动手粉刷。有了房子，又没有用具。我们就找代用品，如拿祭神用的大、小香炉，经过消毒给孩子盛尿和做痰盂。没有床板给孩子睡，我就把自家的床板拿出来，这样一带动，群众也就陆续借出来一些床板。所内一切东西都是用穷办法解决的。
    孩子初入所时，母亲们都在窗外偷看自己孩子有没有哭，保育员对自己孩子护理怎样。而我们却像带自己弟妹一样，冷了帮小孩穿衣服，哭了耐心地哄，拿玩具给他们玩，母亲们看了很满意。我们又想：应怎样使儿童更加健康和活泼，让母亲们安心生产。经过研究，确定先做好卫生工作。我们订出一些卫生制度：如早上把小孩的手巾、茶杯、碗筷进行开水消毒，三天洗地一次，七天大扫除一次，三天洒漂白粉或臭水一次，并培养儿童不随地大小便等。开始时，所内年老的保育员有些不习惯，我就和保育员夏美兰带头执行，坚持一个时期后，其他保育员也跟着做了。四年来，由于卫生制度执行得好，孩子一个个长得健壮可爱。另外，每当季节性的传染病流行的时候，我们就及时预防。三年来，我们托儿所没有发生过传染病，并且孩子逐渐增加，现在已增至四十五个孩子，四名保育员。
    四年来，我把全部精力和时间都放在托儿所的工作上，我感到这是一个崇高的事业、光荣的岗位，那些轻视保育工作的人，才是渺小的。
