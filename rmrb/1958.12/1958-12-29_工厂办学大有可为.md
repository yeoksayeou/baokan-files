    Factories Running Schools Have Great Potential
    Hu Yiren, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Since the beginning of this year, there has been a great leap forward in the workers' education in the factories and mines of Taiyuan City. According to statistics as of the end of September, 730 schools of various types have been established in 89 state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines throughout the city, with a total of more than 140,000 students enrolled, accounting for more than 75% of the total number of employees. Many units have established a set of relatively complete education systems ranging from literacy to university-level continuing education, from elementary technical to junior college-level work-study programs, and from kindergarten to university-level general education. Many units, in addition to the schools run by the factories, have also set up schools in workshops and work sections, and there are even schools run by the masses of workers themselves, truly forming a mass campaign for running schools. These schools are all closely integrated with production based on the needs of production. With the rapid development of workers' education, illiteracy among workers in the city has been basically eliminated, the political awareness and cultural and technical level of the vast number of workers have been universally improved, and the knowledge they have learned has been immediately applied to production, with batches of technological innovators and advanced producers emerging, and new inventions and creations emerging one after another. According to statistics for October, workers in the city made a total of 1,030,000 technological innovations and rationalization proposals, exceeding the total for the entire First Five-Year Plan period, and successfully trial-produced 2,094 new products. This has fundamentally changed the face of factories and mines, making them both factories and schools, both workers and students, which not only popularized education in a more, faster, better and more economical way, but also greatly promoted the development of production. Facts have proved that factories running schools have great potential.

    The emergence of this new situation is based on the development of factory and mine education in the past few years. Since the beginning of this year, with the victory of the rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has been launched. Under the circumstances of this great leap forward in production, it is required to further improve the political, cultural and technical level of the vast number of workers, and to train a large number of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert in a more, faster, better and more economical way. If the face of factory and mine education is not fundamentally changed, it is obviously impossible to meet the needs of the new situation. Especially after the Party Central Committee's education work conference, the Party's education policy was further implemented, and a new atmosphere quickly emerged on the entire education front.

    These achievements fully prove the correctness of the Party's education policy. However, the implementation of the Party's education policy has gone through a series of ideological struggles. There is not only a struggle between two roads, but also a struggle between two methods. Not only have we encountered resistance from various bourgeois educational viewpoints, but there is also a state of superstition and inferiority among some cadres and the masses. These ideological problems, when brought together, roughly reflect three issues:

    First, is it necessary for factories and mines to run schools? Some people think: "Workers can complete production targets even without culture." Some people think that even if workers need culture, "at most, literacy is enough." Some say: "Running schools is the business of the state, and factories running schools are not doing their proper business, which will inevitably affect production." Some, although they also feel the necessity of factories running schools, feel that "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." These ideas are actually resistance to the Party's education policy and negate the necessity of factories running schools. Is it really unnecessary? Many workers believe: "Mechanization and electrification cannot be achieved without culture." It can be seen that the above-mentioned ideas not only fail to see the needs of production, but also ignore the demands of the masses of workers, which is obviously wrong.

    There is also a struggle between two methods on how to run schools. Some people, when they mention running schools, reach out to the state for money, equipment, and teachers, relying solely on the state and experts, without fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. If we act according to the opinions of these people, it is also impossible to achieve the goals of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    There is also a great ideological divergence on what kind of schools should be run in factories and mines. Some people advocate: "If you want to run a school, you must run a decent school," blindly pursuing so-called "regularization," seeking bigness and completeness, and believing that "specialized subjects are not possible, universities cannot be run, and high schools are difficult." This opinion is obviously not in line with the current actual needs.

    These ideological problems must be criticized, but we cannot wait until all ideological problems are resolved before we start taking action. We adopted the method of discussing while acting, developing while acting, and planning while acting. On the one hand, we conscientiously discussed and studied the Party's education policy through various forms such as large and small meetings. On the other hand, we followed the mass line and relied on the masses to find solutions. In this way, after quickly taking action, the effect of practice constantly solved ideological problems and promoted the rapid development of workers' education.

    The schools run by factories and mines are basically of two types: one is part-time, and the other is work-study. Part-time schools are currently the largest in number and have the most students. The contradiction between study time and production time is a universal problem. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, this contradiction has become more prominent. If it is not resolved well, it will inevitably affect production and also affect study. However, it should be seen that production and study are also a unity of opposites. The method we adopted was to hand it over to the masses for discussion, because both production and study are the urgent demands of the masses, and it should be believed that the masses can properly resolve this contradiction. After mobilizing the masses to find solutions, many units quickly made reasonable regulations on time arrangements. Generally, the "seven, seven, ten" (that is, classes A, B, and C work seven, seven, and ten hours in weekly rotation. When working seven hours a week, study for three hours; when working ten hours a week, do not study) and "six, eight, ten" methods are implemented. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory implemented the "five, eight, eleven" system in the processing workshop and the "six, eight, ten" system in the forging and riveting workshop, and the results were very good. This arrangement can achieve three satisfactions (leaders are satisfied, teachers are satisfied, and workers are satisfied); four guarantees (guarantee the time for production, study, Party and League activities, and rest), and does not reduce workers' wages. Workers generally believe that this method is good and should not be changed again. This arrangement is not only conducive to adhering to workers' part-time education, but also a better form of gradual transition to work-study in the current situation. In addition to part-time education, many units have also tried work-study programs. There are currently three main forms of this work-study program: first, newly recruited students, apprentices, and substitute trainees implement work-study programs; second, some cadres and veteran workers are transferred to implement work-study programs, and wages are not deducted during study time with the approval of the leadership; third, units with conditions gradually try out the four-shift system. Although work-study is not yet large-scale, it is the direction of workers' education, a new socialist labor system and education system, and will gradually develop into the main form of factory-run schools.

    No matter which form it takes, it is closely integrated with production. In order to meet the needs of production and the characteristics of adults, while not neglecting the learning of basic knowledge, we have carried out a series of reforms in teaching. The central link of teaching reform is textbook reform. In the process of textbook reform, we also encountered a struggle between two different viewpoints. Some people believe that "teaching can only proceed step by step, haste makes waste, it has been so for thousands of years," and if it is changed, "it will destroy the scientific and systematic nature of the textbooks and reduce the quality of teaching." Some people also have an inferiority complex, thinking that "compiling textbooks and writing books is the business of experts and professors, we can't do it." In response to these ideological problems, Party committees at all levels organized discussions and launched a great debate. During the debate, the vast number of workers were very dissatisfied with the textbooks that had been adopted in the past that were divorced from current politics, divorced from production reality, and unsuitable for the characteristics of adults, believing that "learning and production are two different things, and the books learned cannot be used." And they demanded to speed up the learning progress, calling the system that requires eleven and a half years from elementary school to high school graduation "an old ox pulling a cart up a high mountain," and demanding to "quickly change this method." As a result of the debate, the bourgeois viewpoints of "system theory" and "quality theory" were criticized, and the method of combining teachers, engineering technicians, and workers was adopted to compile textbooks. In terms of the content of the textbooks, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's "three wants and three don'ts" were promoted, namely: basic knowledge is wanted, knowledge related to production is wanted, and knowledge necessary for future advanced studies is wanted; knowledge that is divorced from reality is not wanted, knowledge that students already have is not wanted, and repeated content is not wanted. Practice has proved that the effect is very good after this reform. With the reform of textbooks, necessary reforms have also been carried out in courses, academic systems, and teaching methods. For example, the time required from elementary school to high school in the past, which was eleven and a half years, has been reduced to five years, some courses that are currently unnecessary have been cancelled, and in terms of teaching methods, various forms such as on-site teaching and intuitive teaching have been adopted in addition to the form of classroom lectures. As a result, the time has been greatly shortened, the speed has been strengthened, the workers' academic achievements have been significant, and after learning the knowledge, they can immediately apply it to production. The workers said: "In the past, a book could not be read in half a month, but now there is a new lesson every class, and the enthusiasm for learning is high." Its effect is directly reflected in the greatly improved labor productivity, new records are constantly appearing, and the common practice of working hard and studying hard and actively delving into technology has formed in many units. In this way, the factory naturally becomes a base combining production, teaching, and scientific research. For example, after four students from the Hongzhuan University of the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory began to participate in the study, the leadership handed them the task of manufacturing a native hobbing machine, and drew out an intern and a planner to participate, organizing a six-person technical innovation team. After nine days of research, they completed the entire design of the machine. After the engineer's appraisal, the results not only fully complied with the design principles, but also used many substitutes and waste materials, and the cost of labor and materials was only more than 6,000 yuan, saving 144,000 yuan compared to manufacturing a foreign hobbing machine with the same working ability. Now, on the basis of this team, it has been expanded into a red design institute in the workshop, organizing all the employees in the workshop to form five design institutes and five promotion institutes respectively. Their research projects are basically divided into two categories: one is the research and design of cutting-edge technology, and the other is to solve the key problems in current production according to the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods. The continuous enrichment and improvement of this mass scientific and technological research organization will better combine cultural revolution with technological revolution, and better combine manual labor with mental labor. Therefore, the workers generally reflected that: "We are learning, applying, researching science and technology, and actually operating at the same time, we are workers, students, and engineering technicians at the same time."

    At present, although Taiyuan City's factory and mine-run schools have made some achievements, they are not without shortcomings. The study and discussion of the Party's education policy among cadres and workers is not yet widespread or in-depth enough. Truly implementing the Party's policy is still a long-term ideological struggle process and practice process. In the teaching reform, some units have not yet launched a large-scale mass movement, and many problems remain to be further explored and gradually improved. As long as we adhere to the leadership of the Party committee, fully mobilize the masses, and closely integrate with production, we will surely be able to gradually consolidate and improve the workers' education in factories and mines.

    在劳动人民中间实行普及教育，并且逐步提高教育水平，这是缩小体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别的一个重大步骤，必须认真进行。
              ——摘自“关于人民公社若干问题的决议” 
    工厂办学大有可为
    中共太原市委书记处书记  胡亦仁
    今年以来，太原市厂矿企业的职工教育，有了飞跃的发展。截至9月底统计，在全市八十九个国营、地方国营厂矿中，已经举办了各类学校七百三十多所，入学人数共十四万多人，占职工总人数的75％以上。许多单位建立了从扫盲到大学的业余教育，从初技到大专的半工半读教育，从幼儿园到大学的普通教育，开始形成了一套比较完整的教育体系。许多单位，除了厂办的学校以外，在车间、工段都办起了学校，并且还有职工群众自己办的学校，真正形成了全民办学的热潮。这些学校又都是根据生产的需要，密切结合生产的。随着职工教育的迅速发展，在全市职工中的文盲已经基本扫除，广大职工的政治觉悟和文化技术水平，普遍得到了提高，并且把学到的知识立即用于生产，成批的技术革新者和先进生产者涌现了出来，新的发明创造层出不穷。根据10月份的统计数字，全市职工技术革新和合理化建议共达一百零三万件，超过了第一个五年计划期间的总和，试制成功的新产品达二千零九十四件。这样就使厂矿的面貌发生了根本的变化，既是工厂，又是学校，既是工人，又是学生，不仅多快好省地普及了教育，而且大大地促进了生产的发展，事实证明，工厂办学是大有可为的。
    这种新的局面的出现，是在过去几年来厂矿教育的基础上发展起来的。今年以来，随着整风和反右派斗争的胜利，掀起了工农业生产的大跃进。在这种生产大跃进的形势下，要求进一步提高广大职工的政治、文化和技术水平，要求多快好省地培养出又红又专的大批的工人阶级知识分子队伍。如果不从根本上改变厂矿教育的面貌，显然是不可能适应新的形势的需要。特别是在党中央教育工作会议以后，进一步贯彻执行了党的教育方针，在整个教育战线上迅速出现了新的气象。
    这些成绩的取得，完全证明了党的教育方针的正确。但是在贯彻执行党的教育方针中，是经过了一系列的思想斗争的。不仅有两条道路的斗争，而且有两种方法的斗争，不仅遇到了各式各样的资产阶级教育观点的抵触，而且在部分干部和群众中，也存在着迷信状态和自卑心理。这些思想问题，集中起来，大致反映在三个问题上：
    首先是厂矿要不要办学的问题。有的人认为：“工人没有文化，一样可以完成生产指标”。有的人认为，工人即使需要文化，“至多扫了盲就行了”。有的说：“办学校是国家的事情，工厂办学校是不务正业，势必影响生产”。有的虽然也感到工厂办学的必要，但又觉得“远水不解近渴”。这些思想，实际上是对党的教育方针的抵触，否定工厂办学的必要。是真的不必要吗？许多工人认为：“机械化，电气化，没有文化不能化”。可见上述思想，既没有看到生产的需要，又无视职工群众的要求，显然是错误的。
    在如何办学的问题上，也是存在着两种方法的斗争的。有的人一提到办学校，就是伸手向国家要钱，要设备，要师资，单纯依赖国家，依靠专家，而不充分发动群众，依靠群众。如果按照这种人的意见办事，同样是不可能达到多快好省的目的。
    在厂矿中究竟应该办什么样的学校，也存在着很大的思想分歧。有的人主张：“要办就办个像样子的学校”，一味追求所谓“正规化”，贪大求全，认为“专科没条件，大学办不到，高中有困难”。这种意见，显然也是不切合当前实际需要的。
    对于这些思想问题，必须坚持批判，但也不是等所有思想问题都解决了，才开始行动。我们采取了边议论，边行动，边发展，边规划的办法，一方面，通过大会小会等形式，认真讨论和学习党的教育方针，一方面走群众路线，依靠群众想办法。这样在迅速行动起来之后，实践的效果，又不断解决了思想问题，推动了职工教育的迅速发展。
    厂矿办的学校，基本上有两类，一类是业余的，一类是半工半读的。业余学校在目前数量最大，学生人数也最多。学习时间同生产时间的矛盾问题，是带有普遍性的问题。尤其是从大跃进以来，这个矛盾更显得突出。解决不好，势必影响生产，也影响学习。但是，应该看到，生产同学习也是矛盾的统一。我们采取的办法，是交给群众讨论，因为生产和学习都是群众的迫切要求，应该相信群众能够妥善解决这一矛盾。经过发动群众想办法以后，许多单位很快就在时间安排上作出合理的规定。一般都实行了“七、七、十”（即甲乙丙三班以周轮流工作七、七、十小时，当工作七小时周时，学习三小时，工作十小时周时不学习）和“六、八、十”的办法。太原矿山机器厂在加工车间实行了“五、八、十一”制，在锻铆车间实行了“六、八、十”制，效果都很好。这种安排，可以达到三满意（领导满意、教师满意、工人满意）；四保证（保证了生产、学习、党团活动、休息的时间），而且不减少职工工资。工人普遍认为这个办法好，千万不要再改了，这种安排，既有利于坚持职工业余教育，在目前看来，又是逐步过渡到半工半读的较好形式。除了业余教育以外，许多单位都试行了半工半读。这种半工半读目前主要有三种形式：一是新招收的学生、徒工和代培训工实行半工半读，二是抽调一部分干部和老工人实行半工半读，经过领导批准，在学习时间内不扣工资；三是有条件的单位逐步试行四班制。目前半工半读虽然还不是大量的，但它是职工教育的方向，是社会主义新的劳动制度和教育制度，将逐步发展成为工厂办学的主要形式。
    不论哪种形式，都是密切结合了生产的。为了适应生产的需要和成人的特点，同时又不忽略基础知识的学习，我们在教学方面进行了一系列的改革。教学改革的中心环节是教材改革。在进行教材改革中，同样遇到了两种不同观点的斗争。有的人认为“教学只能循序渐进，欲速则不达，几千年来都是如此”，如果要改，“就会破坏教材的科学性、系统性，就要降低教学质量”。也有的人存在着自卑心理，认为“编教材，著书立说是专家教授的事，咱们干不了”。针对这些思想问题，各级党委组织讨论，展开了大鸣大放大辩论。辩论中，广大工人对于以往采取的那种脱离当前政治，脱离生产实际和不适合成人特点的教材很不满意，认为“学习生产两码事，学了书本用不上”。而且要求加快学习进度，对于那种从高小到高中毕业需要十一年半的制度，称之为“老牛拉车上高山”，要求“赶快改变这种办法”。辩论的结果，批判了那种“系统论”、“质量论”等资产阶级观点，采用了教师、工程技术人员和工人相结合的方法，编写教材。在教材的内容上，推广了太原钢铁厂的“三要三不要”，即：基础知识要，与生产有关的知识要，将来深造必需的知识要；脱离实际的知识不要，学员已有的知识不要，重复的内容不要。这样改革以后，实践证明效果很好。随着教材的改革，在课程、学制、教学方法等方面，也都进行了必要的改革。例如把过去从高小到高中需要十一年半的时间，减少到五年，取消了一些当前不必要的课程，在教学方法上，除课堂讲课的形式外，还采取了现场教学、直观教学等多种多样的形式。这样做的结果，大大地缩短了时间，加强了速度，工人学习成绩显著，并且在学了知识以后，就可以立即用于生产。工人们说：“从前一本书，半月读不完，现在每堂有新课，学习起来劲头大”。其效果，直接反映在劳动生产率的大大提高，新的记录不断出现，而且苦干苦学，积极钻研技术，在许多单位形成了普遍的风气。这样，工厂便自然地成为生产、教学、科学研究三者相结合的基地。例如山西机床厂红专大学的四个学员，在开始参加了学习以后，领导上便把制造一个土滚齿机的任务交给他们完成，并抽出一个见习生和一个计划员参加，组织六个人的技术革新小组，他们经过了九天的研究，完成了机器的全部设计，经工程师鉴定结果，不仅完全符合设计原理，而且是利用了许多代料和废料，工料费仅用六千多元，比制造一个同样工作能力的洋滚齿机节省十四万四千元。现在在这个小组的基础上，已经扩大成为车间的红色设计院，把全车间的职工组织起来，分别组成五个设计所和五个推广所。他们的研究项目，基本是两大类，一是尖端技术的研究和设计，一是按照土洋并举的方针，解决当前生产中的关键问题。这种群众性的科学技术研究组织的不断充实和提高，将使文化革命同技术革命更好地结合起来，使体力劳动同脑力劳动更好地结合起来，因此，工人们普遍反映说：“我们是一边学习，一边应用，一边研究科学技术，一边实际操作，又是工人，又是学生，又是工程技术人员”。
    目前，太原市厂矿办学虽然取得了一些成绩，但并不是没有缺点的。党的教育方针，在干部和职工群众中的学习和讨论，还不够普遍，不够深入。确实贯彻执行党的这条方针，还是一个长期的思想斗争过程和实践过程。在教学改革中，有些单位还没有大搞群众运动，许多问题还有待于继续摸索，逐步求得完善。只要我们坚持党委领导，充分发动群众，密切结合生产，就一定可以使厂矿职工教育逐步走向巩固和提高。
