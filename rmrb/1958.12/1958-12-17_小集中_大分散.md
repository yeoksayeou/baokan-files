Small Concentration, Large Dispersion

Whether enterprises are arranged in a concentrated or dispersed manner is an important issue in industrial construction. Because there are many connections between enterprises, excessive dispersion in layout will cause waste in transportation, public facilities, etc., which is certainly not good. However, excessively concentrating industrial enterprises will also encounter many difficulties. For example, it will cause urban transportation congestion, make it difficult to supply residents with daily necessities, and increase the pressure on urban power and water supply, and so on.

How should it be arranged appropriately? The slogan proposed by Wuzhong City is very good: "Small concentration, large dispersion." This slogan is applicable to both local areas and the whole country.

From the perspective of small local cities, appropriately distributing some factories in rural areas can not only utilize local materials and local "personnel," and sell many products locally; but also use these backbone factories as the core to help rural areas accelerate the realization of commune industrialization.

From a national perspective, changing the current situation of concentrating industries in a few large cities, and distributing newly built factories in small and medium-sized cities, especially in many small cities along the railway lines, will have greater economic effects. And large economic effects, less investment, and more bases for further development mean "speed."

Now is the time for various regions and departments to prepare their basic construction plans for next year. We hope that relevant comrades will also consider the slogan proposed by Wuzhong City, "Small concentration, large dispersion," when arranging basic construction projects.

### 小集中  大分散

    小集中  大分散
    企业安排得集中还是分散，这是工业建设中一个重要问题。由于企业和企业之间的关联很多，布置得过于分散，在运输、公用设施等等方面会造成浪费，这当然不好。但是，把工业企业安排得过分集中，也会遇到很多困难。例如，会造成城市运输紧张，会使居民的生活必需品供应困难，还会增加城市供电供水的压力，等等。
    怎样安排才恰当呢？吴忠市提的口号很好。曰：“小集中，大分散。”这个口号，适用于地方，也适用于全国。
    从地方小城市来说，把一些工厂适当分布在农村，不仅可以就地取材，就地取“人”，很多产品可以就地销售；而且可以以这些骨干厂为核心，帮助农村加速实现公社工业化。
    从全国来说，改变把工业集中在少数大城市里的现状，把新建的工厂分布在中小城市，首先是铁路沿线的许多小城市里，经济上的效果就更大了。而经济效果大，投资少，进一步发展的基点多，这就意味着“速度”。
    现在正是各个地区、各个部门编制明年基本建设计划的时候。我们希望有关的同志在安排基本建设项目的时候，也考虑一下吴忠市提的这个口号：“小集中，大分散。”
