Title: Natural Gas – Oil's Close Relative

Xinhua News Agency reported: Recently, a large amount of underground natural gas has been discovered in and around Shanghai.

Speaking of natural gas, it is an old acquaintance of the Chinese people. We recognized it as far back as the Han Dynasty or even earlier, and later we learned to use it as fuel. The Jin Dynasty writer Zuo Si once used the phrase "Fire wells sink flickering in the dark springs, high flames soar and flicker to the heavens" to describe the natural gas wells of Sichuan. Sichuan's natural gas is world-famous, so Sichuan has always been considered a promising oil-producing area. The good news from the central Sichuan oil region at the beginning of this year confirmed this prediction. Other famous oil fields in the world are also often rich in natural gas. Therefore, finding underground natural gas in Shanghai also means there is hope of finding oil.

Why is there hope? Because oil and natural gas can be said to be close relatives. They are both compounds of carbon and hydrogen, but each natural gas molecule contains fewer carbon and hydrogen atoms. Therefore, one is lighter and the other is heavier; one is a gas, and the other is a liquid.

Where do these hydrocarbons come from? They are formed by the gradual decomposition and transformation of the corpses of organisms accumulated on the calm seabed. Because the still water protects these corpses from immediately reacting with oxygen in the air and rapidly decaying, it is possible that they will turn into oil and natural gas after a long period of time. In the past, it was generally believed that tranquil bays were the best environment for their formation, but now it seems that lakes and marshes on the mainland are not necessarily unable to generate them. Sedimentary rocks are formed at the same time as oil and natural gas. Those rocks with many pores that are permeable to water become the residence of oil and natural gas, while impermeable rocks can tightly cover them and prevent them from escaping. When conditions are right, they can accumulate into large-scale mineral deposits. Due to the different weights, oil is always hidden in the lower part, while natural gas hides in the upper part. Therefore, natural gas is often encountered first when drilling for oil, and natural gas becomes a sign of searching for oil. However, the situation is not the same everywhere. In some places, there is more oil and less gas, while in other places, there is less oil and more gas, or even no oil.

Even if there is no oil, the mine is still valuable because natural gas is also a valuable resource. We can not only use pipes to bring it in and use it directly as fuel, but also use it to synthesize oil, or compress it and store it in bottles to power cars.

As a fuel, natural gas is very superior. The heat generated by burning one cubic meter of natural gas is more than that of one kilogram of high-quality anthracite coal. This can be calculated to show how much coal will be saved by using natural gas, how much manpower will be saved in transporting coal and furnace ash, and how much cleaner the house will be.

Another important use of natural gas is as a chemical raw material. When natural gas burns incompletely, it will produce carbon black, which is a black fine particle mainly composed of carbon. It is an important raw material for manufacturing rubber, electrical materials, and pigments. In addition to manufacturing carbon black, natural gas is also a raw material for manufacturing artificial leather, plastics, plexiglass, fertilizers, and many other products. If it is comprehensively utilized, it is truly a treasure. However, in the past few thousand years, we have not fully utilized it. In the Zigong area of Sichuan, people have long used natural gas to boil salt, using its heat, but wasted a lot of carbon black. In the newly built carbon black factory in Longchang, they only paid attention to obtaining carbon black, wasting a lot of heat. When Chairman Mao visited the Longchang gas mine on March 27 this year, he discovered this problem with amazing observation. People were deeply moved. Under the leadership of the Party, the seventh-section workers of the Zigong No. 1 Salt Factory finally broke the millennium-old convention and produced carbon black from natural gas on May 27, while also burning salt. The resources of the motherland are extremely rich, and the people who have liberated their minds will make it endless.

    天然气——石油的亲兄弟
    川流
    据新华社报道：最近在上海及其附近发现了许多地下天然气。
    谈到天然气，这是我国人民的老相识了，远在汉朝甚至更早以前，我们便认识了它，后来又知道将它作为燃料，晋朝文学家左思曾经以“火井沉荧于幽泉，高焰飞煽于天垂”来描述四川的天然气井，四川的天然气是举世闻名的，因此四川也一向被认为是有希望的石油产地，今年年初川中油区的捷报，证实了这种预见，世界上其他著名的油田，也往往盛产天然气，所以上海找到了地下天然气也就有找到石油的希望。
    为什么会有希望呢？原来石油和天然气可以说是嫡亲兄弟，它们都是碳和氢的化合物，不过每一个天然气的分子里含的碳原子和氢原子都较少罢了，所以一个体轻一个体重，一个是气体，一个是液体。
    从哪里来的这些碳氢化合物呢？这是生物的尸体堆积在风平浪静的水底逐渐分解变化而成，因为有静水的保护使这些尸体没有马上与空气中的氧作用而迅速腐败，有可能在长时期以后变成石油和天然气，过去一般认为宁静的海湾是它们最好的形成环境，不过现在看来大陆上的湖沼中也不见得不能生成。和石油与天然气同时生成的还有沉积岩，那些内部孔隙多能透水的岩石成为石油和天然气的居停主人，而不透水的岩石则可以将它们严密罩住不让逃走，在条件合适时便能大量聚集成矿，由于体重不同的关系，石油总是藏在下部，天然气则躲在上部，因此在钻探石油时常常先碰到了天然气，天然气成了找寻石油的标志。不过在各处的情况并不都是一样的，有的地方油多气少，有的地方则油少气多甚至无油。
    如果没有油，矿井仍然是有价值的，因为天然气也是宝贵的资源。我们不仅可以用管子把它引来直接作为燃料使用，还可以利用它来合成石油，或者把它压缩起来装在瓶子里用来开动汽车。
    作为燃料，天然气是很优越的，每立方公尺天然气燃烧后所生的热比一公斤上等无烟煤还要多，这可以算出利用天然气后将省下多少煤，又省下了多少搬运煤和炉灰的力量，而屋子也会清洁得多。
    天然气还有一个重要用途是作为化工原料，当天然气燃烧不完全时便会生成碳黑，这是一种主要是碳素组成的黑色细粒，它是制造橡胶、电气材料、颜料学的重要原料。除了制造碳黑，天然气还是制造人造皮革、塑料、有机玻璃、肥料以及其他多种多样产品的原料，要是把它综合利用起来，真是浑身是宝。但是在以往几千年中我们就没有全面加以利用，在四川自贡市一带人们早就用天然气来熬盐，利用了它的热，但是白白丢掉了许多碳黑，而在隆昌新建的一个碳黑工厂又只注意了得到碳黑，白白地丢失了许多热；毛主席在今年3月27日访问隆昌气矿时以惊人的观察力发现了这个问题，人们深深感动，于是自贡市制盐一厂七段工人在党的领导下终于打破了千年陈规，在5月27日用天然气制出碳黑，同时又烧了盐巴。祖国的资源是极其丰富的，而解放了思想的人民更将使它变得无穷无尽。
