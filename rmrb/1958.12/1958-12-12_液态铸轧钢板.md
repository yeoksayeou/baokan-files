Liquid continuous casting steel plate is a new steel rolling method in the world. Unlike the general steel rolling method that first casts steel ingots and then heats them for rolling, it directly rolls molten steel into steel. Liquid continuous casting steel plate has fewer steps, simpler equipment, requires less power, and is more efficient. It is a promising simple steel rolling method.

The main components of the equipment used for liquid continuous casting steel plate are two hollow rollers internally cooled with cold water (see schematic diagram). The rollers are placed on a frame at a forty-five-degree angle to the horizontal plane. Roller A is driven by an electric motor through a reducer, and roller B is automatically pressed onto roller A. The top of the frame is equipped with a thumbscrew (C).

The small liquid rolling mill successfully tested by Jinxi Chemical Machinery Plant has rollers with a diameter of 250 mm and a length of 300 mm, a rotation speed of 16 revolutions per minute, and is driven by a 1.5-horsepower motor.

The simple principle of liquid continuous casting steel plate is that when molten steel encounters a cold roller, it solidifies and crystallizes on the roller's surface, and is compressed into steel plate when it reaches the middle of the two rollers. The thickness of the steel plate is determined by the thickness of the steel solidified on the rolling roll, and the thickness of the solidified layer is related to the temperature of the molten steel, the rotation speed of the roller, and the cooling rate inside the roller. As long as these three conditions are properly controlled, and the molten steel continuously flows in, steel plates of various thicknesses can be continuously rolled out.

The thumbscrew at the top of the frame can ensure uniform thickness of the steel plate and control the fineness of the steel plate's structure. A fast roller rotation speed results in a thin steel plate, while a slow rotation speed results in a thick steel plate. There should be two flanges at both ends of the lower roller to prevent molten steel from flowing out from both ends.

    液态铸轧钢板
    液态铸轧钢板，是世界上一种新的轧钢法。它不像一般轧钢法那样先铸成钢锭，然后再加热进行滚轧，而是直接把熔融的钢水轧制成钢材。液态铸轧钢板的工序少，设备简单，所需动力小，效率高，是一种大有前途的简易轧钢法。
    液态铸轧钢板所用设备的主要部件是两个内部用凉水冷却的空心滚筒（见示意图），滚筒放在与水平面成四十五度角的架子上。滚筒甲用电滚通过减速机带动，滚筒乙自动压在滚筒甲上。架子的顶端装有顶丝（丙）。
    锦西化工机械厂试验成功的小型液态轧钢机，滚筒直径是二百五十毫米，长三百毫米，回转速度每分钟十六转，用一点五马力的电动机带动。
    液态铸轧钢板的简单原理是，钢水遇到冷的滚筒，便在滚筒表面凝固、结晶，到达两滚筒中间时受压而成为钢板。钢板的厚度由轧滚上钢水凝结的厚度来决定，而凝固层的厚度与钢水的温度、滚筒的回转速度和滚筒内的冷却速度有关，只要适当控制这三个条件，并使钢水不断地流入，便会连续轧出各种厚度的钢板。
    架子顶部的顶丝可以使钢板厚薄一致，控制钢板组织的细密程度。滚筒回转速度快，则钢板薄，回转速度慢，则成厚钢板。在下滚筒的两端应有两个凸缘，以免钢水从两端流出。
