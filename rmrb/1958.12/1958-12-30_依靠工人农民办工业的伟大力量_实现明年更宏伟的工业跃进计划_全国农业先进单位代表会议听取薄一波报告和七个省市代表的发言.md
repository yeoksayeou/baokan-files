Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Socialist Agricultural Construction continued today. Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a report on industry and transportation at the meeting. Representatives from Hubei Province, Shandong Province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Zhejiang Province, Qinghai Province, Hunan Province, and Beijing made speeches at the meeting.

In his report, Comrade Bo Yibo said that in 1958, the socialist industrialization cause achieved a great victory at a high speed far exceeding any previous year. Industrial production increased by more than 60%. Major industrial products such as steel increased by more than 100%, machine tools by more than 200%, coal by more than 100%, and cotton yarn by 43%. He said that the leap forward in China's industry, agriculture, and other undertakings in 1958, the leap forward in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, formed a sharp contrast to the economic crisis in the Western world. Comrade Bo Yibo then said that based on the great leap forward in 1958, China's industrial development will achieve an even more magnificent goal in 1959. According to the 1959 planned targets, China will produce 18 million tons of steel. This figure is equal to twenty times the highest annual output in old China. This leap forward plan is entirely possible to achieve. He pointed out that in 1958, the achievements on China's agricultural front and the direct involvement of tens of millions of peasant brothers in running industry and transportation powerfully supported the development of the industrial and transportation sectors. To enable China's industry to develop at a high speed, in addition to relying on the strength of the working class, it is also necessary to rely on the strength of more than 500 million peasants. He called on: In 1959, the broad masses of peasant brothers, on the one hand, should strive for a greater harvest than this year on the agricultural front to support national industrialization, and on the other hand, should implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production, to accelerate the industrialization of the communes, and along the victorious road of 1958, achieve harvest after harvest, and leap forward after leap forward.

After Bo Yibo's report, representatives from seven provinces (autonomous regions) and cities spoke at the meeting.

Wu Dejian, representative of Hubei Province (First Secretary of the Macheng County Party Committee), introduced in his speech the achievements of Hubei Province's comprehensive great leap forward in agricultural production this year, in which grain, cotton, oil crops, and other crops all increased by 100% compared with last year. Then, he focused on the production situation in Macheng County this year. He said: The rectification movement led by the Party improved the thinking of cadres and the masses, adjusted the relations among the people, and the relationship between the leadership and the masses became closer. The leadership of cadres in agricultural production also became more in-depth and specific. This is the basic condition for Macheng County to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture and a high yield in steel this year. The county party committee proposed to all party members and cadres in the county to guarantee the realization of the great leap forward in production with a great leap forward in work style, and launched a mass rectification movement. The movement always focused on rectifying work style and opposing right-leaning conservative ideas, and also criticized the ostentatious and unrealistic exaggerations that once appeared among a few cadres, so as to make the Party's ideological education regular. In addition, he also talked about the situation of universal planting of experimental fields and organizing socialist great competitions throughout the county from cadres to the masses. He said that it was precisely because of carrying out these tasks that the high tide of this year's agricultural production movement was promoted, and comprehensive and balanced production increase was achieved.

Zhang Xincun, representative of Shandong Province (Director of the Rural Work Department of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee), introduced in his speech the unprecedented bumper harvest of agricultural production in Shandong Province this year. The total output of grain, cotton, and peanuts has increased by multiples. Cured tobacco, flax, forestry, animal husbandry, and aquaculture have also achieved great results. He said: The bumper harvest of agricultural production this year has greatly liberated the thinking of cadres and the masses, and further encouraged the broad masses to strive for greater harvest with courage and confidence.

People's concept of grain yield per mu is no longer a "hundred" but a "thousand." Zhang Xincun then also talked about the situation of Shandong Province carrying out the movement to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate diseases. When talking about the reasons for achieving the bumper harvest of agriculture this year, Zhang Xincun said that in the past, there had always been a struggle between two roads and two lines in agricultural production in Shandong Province. In the process of organizing the great leap forward in production, the provincial party committee has always unswervingly based itself on the central government's instructions to take politics as the commander, and with rectification as the key link, launched a rectification supplementary class movement in the leading organs at all levels, and launched a mass rectification movement among the masses. Through the rectification movement, cadres greatly developed the work style of the mass line, and further strengthened the relationship between the party and the masses, thereby ensuring the completion of various production tasks.

Xie Donglai, representative of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China), said in his speech: Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have increased grain production by more than 100% this year; oil crops, subtropical crops, and various industrial raw material crops have also increased significantly; livestock, poultry, and freshwater fish have also increased a lot. Driven by the two marshals of steel and grain, the region's cultural, educational, health, transportation, and rural supply and marketing have also greatly developed. The tragic era of "when the rice turns yellow, the bed is full of disease" in history is gone forever. He said that the natural conditions in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region this year were very bad. This year's drought was very serious. However, under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups organized millions of anti-drought armies, and after hard battles, they finally overcame the natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest.

Dai Xingming, representative of Zhejiang Province (Director of the Rural Work Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee), spoke at the meeting with the theme of "Turning Grass and Trees into Treasures, and Vigorously Promoting the Comprehensive Utilization of Agricultural Products." He said that with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the great liberation of thought, especially after the realization of the rural people's commune, the comprehensive utilization of agricultural products has had preliminary development in Zhejiang Province. The people's communes make comprehensive use of various products of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, which is a broad way to develop commune-run industries. It can greatly improve the use value and exchange value of agricultural products, greatly increase the income of the commune, and is of great significance for supporting national construction and consolidating the people's commune. He said that we must further develop the comprehensive utilization of agricultural products in the province, and with practical actions, respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee to "greatly develop the benefits of mountains, rivers, grass, and trees, and greatly develop the comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries."

Zheng Jie, representative of Qinghai Province (Director of the Zelinggou Branch of Delingha Farm), focused on introducing the productive achievements and future leap forward plan of the Delingha Farm, in the Gobi Desert of eastern Qaidam, after five years of hard work. He said that this year, the Delingha Farm has sown more than 27,000 mu of grain crops, with an average yield of more than 1,003 jin per mu, and an average yield of more than 1,079 jin per mu of spring wheat, an increase of nearly two times compared with 1957. From the perspective of the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, it has not only crossed the Yellow River, but also crossed the Yangtze River, and has successfully realized the goal of "Thousand-Jin Farm."

Zhao Jiande, representative of Hunan Province (First Secretary of the Liling County Party Committee), said: The total grain output in Hunan Province this year has doubled compared with last year. The yield per unit area has achieved the production increase targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule. Economic crops such as cotton, rapeseed, camellia, and ramie have all greatly increased in production. He said: The characteristic of the bumper harvest in Hunan Province this year is the province-wide increase in large areas. Whether it is the mountainous area of ​​western Hunan and southern Hunan or the Dongting Lake area, the "land of fish and rice," has generally achieved a bumper harvest. He then introduced the great achievements of Liling County in agricultural and industrial production. In addition to the large increase in grain production, multi-faceted operations such as forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations in the county have also increased by one to several times compared with last year. Most communes have set up small coal mines, iron smelting plants, cement plants, and farm tool factories. He said that next year, to continue to increase grain production, we must also emphasize the development of multi-faceted operations such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and the development of cotton, oil, and other industrial raw material production, as well as livestock production, especially cattle, pigs, fish, chickens, and ducks, must be greatly developed to meet the people's needs for meat and eggs.

Yang Yimin, representative of Beijing (Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry), said that on the basis of the great victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, on the agricultural front in Beijing, since the winter of last year, a movement to implement a series of production increase measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, engineering, and management has been launched. From beginning to end, the movement has been higher than the previous one, and the peasants' enthusiasm for production and drive has been better than the previous one. At the same time, on the basis of the great leap forward in production and the unprecedented increase in socialist consciousness, suburban farmers have comprehensively realized the people's commune, and from then on, the suburban rural areas have entered a new historical stage. He then specifically described the achievements of agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing this year, and pointed out that the facts of the great leap forward and bumper harvest in agricultural production in the suburbs in the past year have refuted the slander that the agriculture in the suburbs cannot advance rapidly.

    依靠工人农民办工业的伟大力量
    实现明年更宏伟的工业跃进计划
    全国农业先进单位代表会议听取薄一波报告和七个省市代表的发言
    新华社29日讯  全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议今天继续举行。中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波在会上作了关于工业与交通问题的报告。湖北省、山东省、广西僮族自治区、浙江省、青海省、湖南省、北京市的七位代表在会上作了发言。
    薄一波同志在报告中说，1958年社会主义工业化事业，以远远超过以往任何一年的高速度，取得了伟大的胜利。工业生产增长了60％以上。主要工业产品，钢增长了一倍以上，机床增长两倍以上，煤炭增长一倍以上，棉纱增长43％。他说，1958年我国工业、农业以及其他各项事业的跃进，苏联和其他社会主义国家的跃进，同西方世界的经济危机形成了鲜明的对照。接着，薄一波同志说，在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年我国工业的发展将要实现一个更加宏伟的目标。按1959年计划指标，我国将生产一千八百万吨钢。这个数字等于旧中国最高年产量的二十倍。这个跃进计划是完全有可能实现的。他指出：在1958年，我国农业战线上的成就和几千万农民兄弟直接动手办工业、交通事业，有力地支援了工业和交通部门的发展。要使我国工业高速度发展，除了依靠工人阶级的力量以外，还必须依靠五亿多农民的力量。他号召：在1959年，广大的农民兄弟，一方面要在农业战线上争取比今年更大的丰收，支援国家工业化，另一方面，要实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，加速公社的工业化，沿着1958年胜利的道路，丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进。
    在薄一波的报告以后，有七个省（自治区）、市的代表在会上发言。
    湖北省代表（中共麻城县委第一书记）吴德简在发言中介绍了湖北省今年农业生产全面大跃进中粮食、棉花、油料等作物都比去年增产一倍的成就，接着，他着重谈了麻城县今年的生产情况。他说：党领导的整风运动，提高了干部和群众思想，调整了人民内部的关系，领导与群众的关系更加亲密了，干部对于农业生产的领导也更加深入具体了，这是麻城县今年获得农业丰收和钢铁丰产的基本条件。县委在全县党员和干部中提出，以工作作风的大跃进来保证实现生产的大跃进，开展了全民整风运动。运动始终以整顿工作作风、反对右倾保守思想为中心议题，又批判了在少数干部中一度出现的华而不实的浮夸作风，做到使党的思想教育经常化。此外，他还谈到全县从干部到群众普遍种试验田和组织社会主义大竞赛的情况。他说，正是由于进行了这些工作，因此推动了今年的农业生产运动高潮，获得了全面的平衡的增产。
    山东省代表（中共山东省委农村工作部部长）张新村，在发言中介绍了山东省今年农业生产获得空前大丰收的情况。粮食、棉花、花生的总产量都成倍地增加了。烤烟、麻类、林业、畜牧、水产等也都取得很大成绩。他说：今年农业生产的大丰收，大大解放了干部和群众的思想，进一步鼓舞了广大群众争取更大丰收的勇气和信心。
    人们对于粮食亩产量的概念已经不是“百”字而是“千”字了。张新村接着也谈到了山东省开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动的情况。在讲到取得今年农业丰收的原因时，张新村说，过去山东省在农业生产上一直存在着两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在组织生产大跃进过程中，省委始终坚持不渝地根据中央提出的以政治为统帅的指示，以整风为纲，在各级领导机关中展开了整风补课运动，在群众中展开了全民整风运动，经过整风运动，干部大大发扬了群众路线的作风，进一步密切了党群关系，因而保证了各项生产任务的完成。
    广西僮族自治区代表（中共广西僮族自治区委员会农村工作部副部长）谢东来在发言中说：广西僮族自治区各族人民在党的领导下，今年粮食增产了一倍以上；油料作物、亚热带作物和各种工业原料作物都有显著增产；牲畜、家禽、淡水鱼也增产很多。在钢铁、粮食两大元帅带动下，全区文教卫生、交通运输和农村供销等也有很大发展。历史上“稻谷黄，病满床”的悲惨时代已一去不复返了。他说，广西僮族自治区今年的自然条件是很不好的。今年的旱情十分严重。但是各族人民在党的正确领导下，组织了几百万抗旱大军，经过苦战，终于战胜了天灾，获得了丰收。
    浙江省代表（中共浙江省委农村工作部部长）戴星明以“变草木为珍宝，大搞农产品的综合利用”为题在会上发言。他说，随着工农业生产大跃进，思想大解放，尤其是实现了农村人民公社化以后，农产品的综合利用，在浙江省已有了初步的发展。人民公社把农林牧副渔各种产品加以综合利用，是发展社办工业的一条广阔的途径。它可以大大提高农产品的使用价值和交换价值，可以大大增加公社的收入，对于支援国家建设和巩固人民公社，都有很重要的意义。他说，我们要把全省的农产品综合利用工作进一步开展起来，以实际行动，响应党中央所提出的“大兴山水草木之利，大大发展农林牧副渔的综合经营”的伟大号召。
    青海省代表（德令哈农场泽林沟分场场长）郑杰在发言中，着重地介绍了柴达木东部戈壁滩上德令哈农场五年如一日地艰苦奋战所取得的丰产成绩和今后的跃进规划。他说，今年德令哈农场共播种粮食作物二万七千多亩，平均亩产达一千零三斤多，春小麦平均亩产一千零七十九斤多，比1957年提高近两倍，从全国农业发展纲要规定的指标来看，不仅跨过了黄河，而且越过了长江，胜利地实现了“千斤场”的目标。
    湖南省代表（中共醴陵县委第一书记）赵建德说：湖南省今年粮食总产量比去年翻了一番，单位面积产量提前实现了“全国农业发展纲要”所规定的增产指标，棉花、油菜、油茶、苎麻等经济作物都有很大增产。他说：今年湖南省丰收的特点是全省性的大面积增产，不论是湘西、湘南的山区和“鱼米之乡”的洞庭湖区，都普遍获得了大丰收。他接着介绍了醴陵县在农业和工业生产中所取得的巨大成绩。全县除粮食大增产外，林、渔、牧、副业多种经营也都比去年增产一倍到几倍。大部分公社办起了小型煤矿、炼铁厂、水泥厂和农具厂。他说，明年要继续增产粮食，又必须十分强调发展农林牧副渔等多种经营和社办工业，发展棉花、油料和其他工业原料的生产以及畜牧业生产，特别是牛、猪、鱼、鸡、鸭要大大发展，以满足人民对肉食品和蛋品的需要。
    北京市代表（北京市农林局副局长）杨益民说，在整风和反右派斗争取得伟大胜利的基础上，北京市农业战线上，自去年冬季以来，就展开了贯彻水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管等一系列增产措施的运动，自始至终，运动一个高过一个，农民的生产热情和干劲一次赛过一次。在这同时，郊区农民在生产大跃进和社会主义觉悟空前提高的基础上，全面实现了人民公社化，从此郊区农村转入到一个新的历史阶段。他接着具体叙述了北京郊区今年农业生产的成就，并且指出，一年来郊区农业生产大跃进、大丰收的事实，驳倒了认为郊区农业不能迅速大步前进的谰调。
