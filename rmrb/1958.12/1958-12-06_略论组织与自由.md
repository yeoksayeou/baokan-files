A Brief Discussion on Organization and Freedom
Qi Zuowen

"You have no freedom." Ever since the Communist Party appeared in this world, the bourgeoisie has used this as a pretext to attack us. Now, with the rural people's communes implementing organizational militarization, action combatization, living collectivization, and management democratization, the imperialists are rehashing this old tune. We really have no interest in engaging in futile written debates with the imperialists. Isn't it ridiculous for exploiters to attack laborers on the issue of freedom? The kind of freedom that exists in countries like that of Mr. Dulles: the freedom of the bourgeoisie to exploit and oppress the working people, the freedom of colonialists to invade weak nations, we certainly do not have here, and will never have again. This is a great and fortunate thing, and it is what the working people have been longing for over the centuries.

Within the people, after the rural people's communes implemented organizational militarization, action combatization, living collectivization, and management democratization, there are also some people, either driven by their class instincts or because their thinking lags behind the changing situation, who have some misunderstandings about the relationship between organization and freedom, discipline and freedom. This must be explained.

The "Four Transformations" implemented by the people's communes are precisely not intended to narrow and hinder the freedom of the working people, but to expand and guarantee it. We can think about this issue from the perspective of both class struggle and the struggle for production.

All exploiting classes in the world like the working people to be in a state of disunity and fear them being organized the most. Because when the working people are in a state of disunity, it is easy for them to consolidate their reactionary rule; while when they are organized, there is a risk of overthrowing their reactionary rule. Don't capitalist countries claim freedom of assembly? That's a lie! The ruling classes in capitalist countries can use all sorts of excuses to cancel freedom of assembly. For example, as long as the police think it "hinders traffic" or "honest" and "strong" people feel that "order" is in danger of being disrupted, the so-called freedom of assembly is nullified by police batons. However, the interests of the working people are completely opposite to those of the exploiting classes. For the working people, only by resolutely overcoming disunity and organizing themselves closely can they obtain freedom from exploitation and oppression. Song Jiang and Wu Song in the Water Margin were such heroes, but even with Song Jiang's talent and Wu Song's bravery, before they went to Liangshan and organized themselves, they were still subjected to tattooing and exile. The reason was that it was a feudal society where jackals were in power, and the exploiting classes did not allow the common people to have freedom. It is the same in capitalist societies. The proletariat must organize their own political parties and their own armed forces in order to seek liberation. The last sentence in the "Communist Manifesto" published by Marx and Engels more than a hundred years ago was "Workers of all countries, unite!" Lenin also said: "The bourgeoisie has the means of production and the state machinery in hand, and it uses these tools to rule the proletariat, while the proletariat has nothing. Its only weapon in the struggle against capital is organization."

Organization is also out of the needs of the struggle for production. For thousands of years, although mankind has made many achievements in the struggle for production, the relationship between mankind and nature is still not very free. We rely on the sky for food, and are subject to the sky; we rely on the land for food, and are subject to the land. Because our country has long been dominated by a small-scale peasant economy, it is poor and backward, and our people are more severely controlled by nature. Among the 600 million people, 500 million are engaged in agricultural production, and it takes a lot of effort to solve the problem of food, which is a manifestation of unfreedom. An important way to overcome the unfree state of mankind being subjected to nature is to change the scattered individual agricultural economy, establish a collective large-scale production economy, that is, to organize and develop production. In recent years, through the cooperative movement, the transformation from a scattered small-scale peasant economy to a collective cooperative economy is precisely because we have organized under the leadership of the Party that the face of agricultural production has undergone great changes. In order to further develop agricultural production and further overcome the unfree state of mankind being subjected to nature, it is necessary to further organize to fight for greater freedom from nature.

The rise of the people's communes and the implementation of the "Four Transformations" completely meet the objective requirements of the struggle for production. With the development of agricultural production, especially the great leap forward in agriculture since last winter, agricultural production cooperatives have gradually appeared to be unable to coordinate with the development of the situation. Large-scale farmland capital construction, the adoption of advanced agricultural technology measures, the development of diversified operations, the establishment of rural industries, and the implementation of agricultural industrialization, all of these cannot be undertaken by the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of a single agricultural production cooperative of dozens or hundreds of households. Obviously, only by running people's communes on a large scale and implementing the "Four Transformations," centralizing leadership, comprehensively planning, unifying arrangements, dividing labor and cooperating can we adapt to and promote the great leap forward of agricultural productive forces. After communization, are we no longer free because we are organized? From the perspective of the struggle for production, we are more free, and we have further gotten rid of nature's constraints on mankind. For example, some places were originally prone to major disasters with heavy rain, minor disasters with light rain, and disasters even without rain, but after large-scale farmland water conservancy was built, they are no longer afraid of drought or floods. Isn't this more free than in the era of the small-scale peasant economy?

When organized, there must be discipline. Why organize? Organization is for the sake of unified action to strive for common freedom. Without common discipline to abide by, how can we talk about unified action, how can we be considered organized, and how can we strive for common freedom? Discipline guarantees freedom and constrains freedom. What is guaranteed is freedom that conforms to the highest interests of the vast majority of people, and what is constrained is freedom that exceeds this scope. We do not believe in discipline blindly. Discipline is not omnipotent. However, we also oppose the one-sidedness of wanting only freedom and not discipline. If an organization has no discipline, it falls into a paralyzed state of anarchy, and all social production cannot proceed or will be destroyed. Our discipline is based on conscious execution. The key to whether a person can consciously abide by discipline lies in whether they have altruistic spirit. The so-called altruistic spirit means that people, after correctly understanding the relationship between the individual and the collective, realizing that no individual can live alone without others, without the collective, without society, that is, after recognizing the consistency between altruism and self-interest, do not only consider self-interest in everything, but first consider what is beneficial to others, beneficial to the collective, and beneficial to society. This spirit comes from a high degree of consciousness. Therefore, people who have this spirit will naturally not violate the disciplines that are originally intended to protect the collective interests, that is, the common interests of the people, and they will not feel that abiding by such disciplines is a restriction. On the contrary, in the eyes of those who only know self-interest and do not want altruism, abiding by discipline is a restriction.

Some people say: "After being organized, the collective has freedom, but the individual has no freedom." This is a misunderstanding.

First of all, a collective is composed of many individuals. An individual is a member of the collective. The freedom of the collective is actually the common freedom of the many individuals who make up the social collective. Since this is the case, the more freedom the collective has, the more common freedom each individual actually has. How can we say that there is no individual freedom when there is collective freedom?

Secondly, organizing and acting collectively is out of the needs of class struggle and the struggle for production. It is to obtain freedom from oppression, exploitation, and aggression; to fully develop people's intelligence and freedom to engage in labor and creation; to enable people to control nature and dominate the destiny of nature; and to not be slaves to nature. This is great freedom, and it is also a great collective. Because this is the common freedom of the vast majority of people, that is, collective freedom. People's lives need to be organized in order to strive for these great freedoms. Military life must be collectivized because it is impossible to fight without it; rural people's communes run public canteens and nurseries on a large scale, not for anything else, but to liberate female labor and to facilitate the organization of production. Therefore, if some individual life problems, from the perspective of the interests of class struggle and production struggle, do not need to be collectivized, or if collectivization is forcibly implemented but is not conducive to the interests of class struggle and production struggle, then each person should of course be allowed to have their own freedom. It is just that this kind of freedom can only be regarded as small freedom compared with the freedom to be strived for in the class struggle or production struggle. This small freedom can only be fully developed under the premise that it does not infringe upon the collective's great freedom. Small freedom must be subordinate to great freedom. At the same time, the more great freedom there is, the more fully there can be small freedom. Because without the collective's great freedom, there can be no talk of individual small freedom. If China had not been liberated, where would we get the various small freedoms we now enjoy under the socialist system? If productivity is not greatly improved, and the means of production and means of subsistence are not greatly enriched, how can we imagine various small freedoms in personal life and consumption? "If the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" We should understand this principle.

The ten fingers are always uneven, and each individual has their own preferences. Forcing everyone to have the same taste, the same hobbies, and the same interests, and requiring people to be uniform in all life problems is petty-bourgeois absolute egalitarianism, not socialism. Many public canteens have only just started, with little experience and insufficient material resources, so there may be fewer varieties, but socialism and public canteens can only get better and better, not worse and worse. Many of our favorite dishes that we cannot eat at home will be available in the canteen in the future. Moreover, eating in the public canteen does not prohibit people from sometimes cooking some small dishes for themselves. The public canteen of the Wanchun People's Commune in Sichuan allows people to have freedom in eating. For example, recently the commune decided to distribute some vegetables suitable for making pickles to the members, two to three catties per person, so that the members can make their own pickles. In addition, a certain amount of glutinous rice and soybeans are distributed to the members for them to make their own fermented rice and fermented tofu. In terms of clothing, people are not required to wear the same color clothes, but are allowed to have the freedom to choose the cloth they like. As the quantity of products increases, the scope of this freedom of choice will also expand.

The "Four Transformations" implemented by the people's communes are the embodiment of the principle of democratic centralism. There are aspects of centralization, but even more aspects of democracy. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Among the people, there cannot be freedom without discipline, nor can there be democracy without centralism. The unity of democracy and centralism, and the unity of freedom and discipline, constitutes our democratic centralism." Some people ask: "Can the unity of freedom and discipline, and the unity of democracy and centralism, be truly achieved?" If you don't believe it, look at our People's Liberation Army. Military life should be the most organized and disciplined, but our army is not only the most organized and disciplined army, but also the most democratic army, implementing three major democracies (military, political, and economic). It has been like this for more than 30 years since the army was built. Our army is the people's army. It needs centralized unity, it needs to be organized and disciplined, because this is necessary to defeat the enemy, otherwise there would be no combat effectiveness; however, this is by no means equal to oppression, not equal to rudeness, not equal to undemocratic; because this centralized unity, this organization and discipline are deemed necessary and consciously observed by revolutionary soldiers. Since the People's Liberation Army can achieve the unity of high democracy and high centralism, why can't the people's communes? Of course, for the newly established people's communes, due to insufficient experience, it still takes a period of time to correctly handle the relationship between democracy and centralism; a very small number of cadres, because the three styles and five airs have not been eliminated, may also distort the spirit of the "Four Transformations" and attempt to use simple and coercive methods to solve right and wrong issues and ideological issues. Any new thing will inevitably have some shortcomings and problems, but this is not the mainstream, and it is easy to improve and correct. We should have a correct attitude towards new things. Some people, as soon as they mention militarization, as soon as they hear about centralized unity, as soon as they talk about organization and discipline, immediately associate it with forced orders, associate it with only suppressing and not persuading, associate it with not allowing people to have any freedom. This is a big mistake. This is a conditioned reflex formed under the long-term influence of the social phenomenon of people oppressing people and people exploiting people in class society. This conditioned reflex must be corrected.

    略论组织与自由
    齐作文
    “你们没有自由”。自从这个世界上有了共产党以来，资产阶级便以此为由头来攻击我们。现在，当农村人民公社实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化后，帝国主义又重弹这种老调了。我们实在没有兴致和帝国主义者进行枉费笔墨的争论。剥削者在自由问题上攻击劳动者，岂不使人忍俊不止么？像杜勒斯先生之流的国家里的那种自由：资产阶级剥削和压迫劳动人民的自由，殖民主义者侵略弱小民族的自由，在我们这里，确实没有，而且永远不会再有了。这是谢天谢地的大好事，也是千百年来劳动人民一向引领企望的事。
    在人民内部，当农村人民公社实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化、管理民主化后，也有一些人，或者出于阶级本能的驱使，或者由于思想落后于形势的变化，因而对于组织与自由、纪律与自由的关系发生一些误解。这是必须加以说明的。
    人民公社实行“四化”，恰恰不是用以缩小和妨碍劳动人民的自由，而是用以扩大和保障劳动人民的自由。我们可以分别从阶级斗争和生产斗争的角度来思考这个问题。
    世界上一切剥削阶级最喜欢劳动人民处于一盘散沙的状态，最怕劳动人民组织起来。因为劳动人民处于一盘散沙状态，便于他们巩固其反动统治；而组织起来，则有推翻其反动统治的危险。资本主义国家不是号称集会自由么？那是骗人的！资本主义国家的统治阶级可以用种种借口来取消集会自由，例如只要警察认为“妨碍交通”，或者“正直”而“坚强”的人感到“秩序”有被破坏的恐怖，所谓集会自由就被警棍勾消了。可是，劳动人民的利害和剥削阶级完全相反。对于劳动人民来说，只有坚决克服一盘散沙状态并且严密组织起来，才能获得免于剥削和压迫的自由。水浒传中的宋江、武松何等英雄，然而即使有宋江之才及武松之勇，在未走上梁山组织起来之前，仍然免不了刺面发配的命运，原因是那个时候是豺狼当道的封建社会，剥削阶级是不让小民有自由的。在资本主义社会中，也是如此。无产阶级必须组织自己的政党和自己的武装，才能求得解放。马克思、恩格斯在一百多年前出版的“共产党宣言”中的最后一句话，不就是“全世界无产者，联合起来”么！列宁也曾说过：“资产阶级有生产资料和国家机器在手，它用这些工具来统治无产阶级，而无产阶级却一无所有，它在反对资本的斗争中唯一的武器就是组织。”
    组织起来也是出于生产斗争的需要。几千年来，人类在生产斗争中虽取得许多成就，但人类与自然的关系还是不大自由的。靠天吃饭，受制于天，靠地吃饭，受制于地。由于我国长期以来是个小农经济占优势的国家，贫穷而落后，我国人民受自然的支配更为严重。在六亿人民中，有五亿人从事农业生产，而且需用很大的努力，才能解决吃饭问题，这就是不自由的表现。克服人类屈服于自然的不自由状态的重要方法，就是改变分散的个体农业经济，建立集体的大生产经济，也就是说组织起来发展生产。这几年来经过合作化运动，从分散的小农经济转化为集体的合作经济，正是因为在党的领导下组织起来了，农业生产的面貌才发生了很大的变化。而为了农业生产更大的发展，更进一步克服人类屈服于自然的不自由状态，就需要更进一步地组织起来去向自然争取更大的自由。
    人民公社的兴起和“四化”的实行，完全符合生产斗争的客观要求。随着农业生产的发展，特别是去冬以来的农业大跃进，农业生产合作社逐渐显得不能同形势的发展协调了。大规模的农田基本建设，先进的农业技术措施的采用，多种经营的发展，农村工业的兴办和农业工厂化的实行，所有这些，都不是几十户或几百户的单一的农业生产社的人力、物力和财力所能从事的。显然，只有大办人民公社和实行“四化”，集中领导，全面规划，统一安排，分工协作，才能适应和推动农业生产力的大跃进。公社化后，组织起来了，不自由吗？从生产斗争角度来看，是更自由了，进一步摆脱自然对于人类的束缚了。例如：有一些地方本来是大雨大灾、小雨小灾、不雨也灾，但在农田水利大举兴办之后，既不怕旱，也不怕涝，比起小农经济时代不是自由了么？
    组织起来了，必然有纪律。为什么要组织起来？组织起来是为了一致行动去争取共同的自由。没有共同遵守的纪律，怎能谈得到一致行动，怎能算是组织起来，又怎能去争取共同的自由？纪律保障自由，又约束自由。保障的是符合最大多数人的最高利益的自由，约束的是超出这个范围的自由。我们不迷信纪律，纪律不是万能的。但是，我们也反对只要自由、不要纪律的片面性。组织没有纪律，就陷入瘫痪的无政府状态，一切社会生产就不能进行或者会遭到破坏。我们的纪律建立在自觉执行的基础上，一个人能不能自觉地遵守纪律的关键，在于有没有利他精神。所谓利他精神，就是人们在正确地认识了个人和集体的关系，认识了任何个人不能离开别人、离开集体、离开社会而孤独地生活之后，也就是在认识了利他与利己的一致性之后，凡事不是只从利己打算，而是首先从有利于人、有利于集体、有利于社会来作打算。这种精神，出之于高度的自觉，因而有了这种精神的人，自然不会去触犯那些本来是保护集体利益亦即人们共同利益的纪律，他也不会感到遵守这种纪律是拘束；相反，在那些只知利己、不愿利他的人看来，遵守纪律才是一种拘束。
    有人说：“组织起来后，集体有自由，个人无自由。”这是一种误解。
    首先，集体是由许多个人组成的，个人是集体的一分子，集体的自由，实际上就是组成为社会集体的许许多多个人的共同一致的自由，既然如此，集体的自由愈多，实际上也就是各个人的共同的自由愈多，怎能说有了集体的自由就没了个人的自由？
    其次，组织起来、集体行动是出于阶级斗争和生产斗争的需要。是为了取得不受压迫、不受剥削、不遭侵略的自由；为了充分发挥人们聪明才智和从事劳动创造的自由；为了人们能够控制自然界主宰自然界命运的自由，为了不做自然奴隶的自由。这是大自由，也是大集体。因为这是绝大多数人共同的也就是集体的自由。人们的生活需要组织起来，也是为了争取这些大自由。军队的生活必需集体化，因为不这样就无法作战；农村人民公社大办公共食堂，办托儿所，不为别的，为的是解放妇女劳动力，为了有利于组织生产。因此，有些个人的生活问题，从阶级斗争和生产斗争的利益来看，并无集体化的必要时，或者勉强实行了集体化反而不利于阶级斗争和生产斗争的利益，那当然应该允许有各人的自由。只是这种自由，同阶级斗争或生产斗争所要争取的自由比较起来，只能算是小自由罢了。这种小自由只能在不侵犯集体的大自由的前提下，才允许充分发展，小自由必须服从大自由，同时，大自由愈多，才愈能有充分的小自由。因为没有了集体的大自由，也就谈不到个人的小自由。试问如果中国没有解放，哪来我们现在在社会主义制度下所享受的种种小自由？如果生产力不是极大的提高，生产资料和生活资料不是极大的丰富，怎能想像种种个人生活和消费上的小自由。“皮之不存，毛将焉附。”这个道理，我们是应当懂得的。
    十个指头总是不齐的，各个人总有各自的癖好。强迫所有的人都一个口胃、一样爱好、一种志趣，要求人们在一切生活问题上都一律化，这是小资产阶级的绝对平均主义，而不是社会主义。现在许多公共食堂才开始办，经验少，物力不足，花式品种可能少些，但是社会主义和公共食堂只能越办越好，不能越办越坏，许多自己所心爱的菜，在自己家里吃不到的将来都可以在食堂里吃到。而且，吃公共食堂也并不禁止人们有时自己烧点小菜吃吃。四川万春人民公社的公共食堂，就允许人们在吃饭问题上有自由。例如，最近公社决定将一部分适宜做泡菜的蔬菜分给社员，每个人分二斤至三斤，让社员自己做泡菜、咸菜。另外还分一定数量的糯米、黄豆给社员，供社员自家做老糟、糟豆腐等。穿衣方面，也不是人们都穿一色的衣服，而是允许各人有挑选自己中意的布的自由。产品数量愈是增长，这种自由选择的范围也将愈加扩大。
    人民公社实行的“四化”，就是民主集中制的原则的体现。有集中的方面，更有民主的方面。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中教导我们：“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中，这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。”有人问：“自由与纪律的统一、民主与集中的统一，能够真正做到么？”如若不信，请看我们的人民解放军吧。军事生活应该是组织性、纪律性最强的了，但是我们的军队不仅是组织性、纪律性最强的军队，而且是最民主的军队，实行三大民主（军事、政治、经济）。建军三十余年以来，一直如此。我们的军队是人民的军队，它需要集中统一，需要有组织有纪律，因为这是战胜敌人所必需的，否则就没有什么战斗力了；但是，这决不等于压迫，不等于粗暴，不等于不民主；因为这种集中统一，这种组织性、纪律性都是革命军人所认为必需而自觉遵守的。既然人民解放军做得到高度的民主和高度的集中的统一，为什么人民公社做不到呢？当然，对于刚刚创立的人民公社来说，由于经验不足，正确地处理民主与集中的关系还需要有一段过程；极少数的干部由于三风五气未除，也可能歪曲“四化”精神，企图用简单的与强制的方法来解决是非问题和思想问题。任何一件新事物，总难免或多或少会有这一类缺点和问题，但这不是主流，而且这是容易改进和纠正的。我们对新事物应该有正确的态度。有些人一提到军事化，一听到集中统一，一讲起组织性、纪律性，马上就联想到强迫命令，联想到只压服不说服，联想到不让人们有任何自由，这是大错特错的。这是在阶级社会里那种人压迫人、人剥削人的社会现象的长期影响下，所形成的一种条件反射。这种条件反射是必须纠正的。
