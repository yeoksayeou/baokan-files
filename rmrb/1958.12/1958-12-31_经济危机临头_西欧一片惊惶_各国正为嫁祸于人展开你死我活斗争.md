Xinhua News Agency, December 30th – On the eve of the so-called “Common Market” of the six Western European countries coming into effect, a free-for-all in the form of a currency struggle has already broken out among the major capitalist countries of Western Europe, thus kicking off a brutal scramble for markets. This free-for-all is occurring as the global capitalist economic crisis deepens further. It not only profoundly exposes the unprecedented intensification of contradictions within the imperialist camp, but also reflects the panic of the major capitalist countries of Western Europe in the face of the looming crisis.

1958 was the year in which the impact of the economic crisis that began in the United States became clearer in Western Europe. Crisis symptoms such as production stagnation and decline, product sales difficulties, and increased unemployment, which had already appeared in Western European countries in the second half of 1957, developed further this year.

Looking at the industrial production of Western European countries this year, the expansion speed of countries such as West Germany, France, and Italy, which had maintained a trend of production expansion for several years after the war due to various factors, has greatly slowed down or stagnated this year; the absolute output of some important industrial sectors has even seen a significant decline. In the United Kingdom, where industrial production has been stagnant for three years, production has been declining rapidly since February this year, with the rate of decline increasing month by month. The industrial production of other countries such as Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands has also further declined this year.

The reduction in production and sluggish sales of coal and steel are common features of Western European countries this year; the recession in these two key sectors has in turn had a serious impact on the national economies of these countries. It is estimated that due to production decline caused by shrinking foreign sales, West Germany, the largest steel producer in Western Europe, will see its crude steel production for this year decrease by 1.5 million to 1.7 million tons compared to the 24.5 million tons for the entire year of last year; the utilization rate of steel industry equipment will only reach 75%. In the United Kingdom, where steel production has been stagnant for three years, crude steel production in the first three quarters of this year decreased by 10% compared to the same period last year; it is estimated that the crude steel production for the entire year will only reach around 19 million tons. Steel production in Italy and Belgium has also declined sharply this year.

The severity of the coal industry crisis exceeds that of the steel industry. By the end of October this year, the amount of unsold coal stockpiled in the six countries of the Western European "Coal and Steel Community" had reached 50 million tons, exceeding the total coal production of these countries for one and a half months, and the coal piles are still increasing daily. By the end of October, unsold coal stockpiles in the United Kingdom also exceeded 17 million tons, more than double the amount in the same period last year. At present, Belgium and the United Kingdom have begun to close down so-called "unprofitable" mines on a large scale; and West Germany had already implemented a mandatory "layoff" system as early as this spring. In order to prevent the coal piles from continuing to increase, West Germany recently decided to restrict the import of American coal on the one hand, and on the other hand, lowered coal prices by 10% for dumping abroad. These measures have aroused dissatisfaction from the United States and other Western European countries.

In the textile industry, due to the further decline in the purchasing power of domestic workers and the intensification of competition in foreign markets, Western European countries have also generally encountered serious difficulties this year.

Under the direct impact of the American economic crisis, the import and export trade of the capitalist world has shown a further contraction this year. Major Western European industrial countries, which mainly rely on exporting manufactured goods to exchange for food and raw materials, have therefore been greatly affected. In the first three quarters of this year, the total value and volume of British exports decreased by an average of 4% compared to the same period last year. West Germany, which has been relying on expanding exports to stimulate its domestic industrial production for several years, spent a great deal of effort in the first half of this year to barely increase its export volume by 1% compared to last year.

The direct consequence of production reduction and sluggish sales is the further deterioration of the living conditions of the working people in Western European countries. First of all, the unemployment population in various countries has generally increased: in the United Kingdom, by mid-November, the total number of unemployed people registered at official job centers had exceeded 570,000, breaking the peak of the past 18 years. In West Germany, despite official attempts to absorb a surplus of labor by using construction barracks and other military equipment, the unemployment population, after a period of decline, rebounded sharply in the second half of this year, increasing by nearly 70,000 in October alone. According to official statistics, the total number of unemployed people in France reached 100,000 in October, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year. The unemployment population in Belgium is currently growing rapidly at an average rate of 9,000 to 11,000 people per week. In Italy, the total number of unemployed people has exceeded 1.8 million, accounting for about 9% of the total employed population; a large number of Italian unemployed are forced to flee abroad to make a living. In Denmark, the unemployment population once accounted for 18% of the total employed population. In Austria, the unemployment population increased by no less than 33,000 in the first half of December alone. In addition, a large number of semi-unemployed people who are forced to reduce their working hours have also greatly reduced their income. This further promotes the vicious cycle of relative overproduction of industrial products.

The examples listed above are already enough to depict a gloomy and bleak picture of Western European countries this year. Under the shadow of the economic crisis, the cutthroat competition carried out by these countries to shift the disaster of the crisis onto others is bound to become increasingly open and acute. This is the best portrayal of "the enemy is rotting day by day" and the imperialist camp being in the process of disintegration.

### 经济危机临头  西欧一片惊惶  各国正为嫁祸于人展开你死我活斗争

    经济危机临头  西欧一片惊惶
    各国正为嫁祸于人展开你死我活斗争
    新华社30日讯  在所谓西欧六国“共同市场”生效前夕，以货币斗争的形式出现的一场混战已经在西欧各主要资本主义国家间展开，从而揭开了争夺市场的残酷厮杀的序幕。这场混战是在资本主义世界性经济危机进一步向纵深发展的时候发生的。它不但深刻地暴露了帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的空前尖锐化，而且还反映了西欧各主要资本主义国家对危机临头的惊惶失措。
    1958年是从美国开始的经济危机对西欧的影响更趋明朗的一年。早在1957年下半年就已经在西欧各国先后出现的生产停滞和衰退、产品滞销和失业人数增加等危机征象，在这一年有了进一步的发展。
    从今年西欧各国的工业生产情况来看，战后几年来由于种种因素而一直保持了生产扩张趋势的西德、法国和意大利等国，一年来扩张的速度都大大放慢或陷于停滞；某些重要工业部门的绝对产量甚至还有明显的下降。三年来工业生产基本处于停滞状态的英国，从今年2月起生产更以逐月增大的幅度迅速下降。其余丹麦、比利时、荷兰等国的工业生产，一年来也进一步下降。
    煤、钢工业的减产滞销是今年西欧各国的普遍特征；这两个关键性部门生产的衰退又转而对各国的国民经济产生了严重影响。据估计，由于国外销路萎缩引起生产减退，西欧第一产钢国西德今年的原钢产量要比去年全年的二千四百五十万吨减少一百五十万到一百七十万吨；钢铁工业设备利用率只能达到75％。三年来钢铁生产一直陷于停滞状态的英国，今年头三个季度的原钢产量比去年同期减产10％；全年原钢产量估计只能达到一千九百万吨左右。意大利和比利时的钢产量今年也急遽下降。
    煤业危机的严重情况更超过钢铁工业。到今年10月底为止，西欧
  “煤钢联营”六国中由于卖不出去而积存起来的煤已经达到五千万吨，超过了这些国家一个半月的煤产总量，而且存煤堆还在逐日增高。10月底英国滞销的存煤也超过了一千七百万吨，比去年同期增加一倍多。目前比利时和英国等已经开始大批封闭所谓“不盈利”的矿井；而西德早在今年春季开始就实行了强制“歇班”制。为了使存煤堆不继续增高，西德最近一方面决定限制美国煤进口，一方面又降低煤价10％向国外倾销。这些措施已经引起了美国和西欧其他国家的不满。
    在纺织业方面，由于国内劳动人民购买力的进一步降低和国外市场竞争的加剧，西欧各国今年也普遍遭到严重的困难。
    一年来在美国经济危机的直接响影下，资本主义世界的进出口贸易都呈现了进一步的萎缩。主要依靠向外推销工业制成品来换取粮食和原料的西欧各主要工业国因此受到了很大打击。在今年头三个季度中，英国的出口总值和总量平均比去年同期下降了4％。几年来一直依靠扩大出口来刺激本国工业生产的西德，今年上半年费了九牛二虎之力才勉强使出口量比去年增加了1％。
    减产滞销的直接后果是西欧各国劳动人民生活状况的进一步恶化。首先各国的失业人口有了普遍的增加：在英国，到11月中旬为止，在官方职业介绍所登了记的全失业者已经超过五十七万人，突破了十八年来的高峰。在西德，尽管官方企图利用建筑兵营和其他军用设备来吸收一批过剩的劳动力，但是失业人口在一度下降之后到今年下半年又急遽回升，仅10月份一个月内就增加了将近七万人。据官方统计，法国的全失业人数在10月份达到十万人，比去年同期增加了12％。比利时的失业人口目前正以每周平均增加九千人到一万一千人的速度迅速增长着。在意大利，失业总人数已经超过一百八十万人，占全体就业人口的9％左右；大批意大利失业者被迫流亡到国外谋生。在丹麦，失业人口在就业总人口中曾经占到18％的比重。在奥地利，失业人口仅在12月上半月内就增加了不下三万三千人。此外，大批被迫减少了工作时间的半失业者也大大减少了收入。这样就更加促进了工业产品相对过剩的恶性循环。
    仅仅是上面所列举的一些事例，就已经描绘出今年以来西欧各国的一片阴暗惨淡景象。在经济危机的阴霾笼罩下，这些国家为了要把危机灾难转移到别人头上，它们所进行的你死我活的竞争就必然日趋公开化和尖锐化。这正是“敌人正在一天天烂下去”和帝国主义阵营内部正在处于分崩离析过程中的最好写照。
