    “And Quiet Flows the Don” Part Two
    Following the screening of the first part of the film “And Quiet Flows the Don,” the second part has now been released. The characters appearing in this film, though mostly familiar to us, such as Grigory and Aksinya, find themselves in greatly changed circumstances. The burning flames of the fervent revolution have ignited, the conflict between the new and the old is directly displayed, and class contradictions are also intensified.
    In this turbulent era, Grigory's dual character is even more clearly expressed. Influenced by the Bolshevik Podtyolkov, he temporarily supports the Soviet regime; however, his erroneous ideas lead him to participate in counter-revolutionary riots. Actor Glebov, as in the first film, excellently portrays the character's complex inner activities.
    The Bolsheviks Mikhail Koshevoy, Bunchuk, and others in the film leave quite a deep impression; and the scene where the revolutionary Cossack captain Podtyolkov is executed by the White Army is even more exciting. Even in his final moments, he proudly and bravely proclaims the truth of the revolution!
    But things are not over yet. Which path Grigory will ultimately take, and what the fate of him and Aksinya will be, will only be revealed in the third film. (Fang)

    “静静的顿河”第二部
    继影片“静静的顿河”第一部映出后，现在又映出了“静静的顿河”第二部。在这部影片里出现的人物，虽然大部分是我们熟悉的，如葛利高里、婀克西妮娅等；但是这些人物所处的环境却大大地改变了。炽热的革命的烈火燃烧起来，新与旧的冲突直接地展示出来，阶级矛盾也尖锐化了。
    在这动荡的年代里，葛利高里的双重性格也表现得更加鲜明。他因为受到布尔什维克波得琪勒珂夫的影响，暂时拥护苏维埃政权；然而他的错误想法，又使他参加了反革命暴动。演员格列波夫，像在第一集影片中一样，出色地表现了角色的复杂的内心活动。
    影片中布尔什维克米海依尔·珂晒沃依、彭楚克等人给人的印象是相当深刻的；而革命的哥萨克队长波得琪勒珂夫被白匪军处死的场面，更是激动人心。他在临死前一刻仍然那么骄傲地、勇敢地宣扬着革命真理！
    但是事情还没有结束。葛利高里到底要走上哪一条路，他和婀克西妮娅的结局怎样，那要在影片的第三集中才能看到了。  （方）
