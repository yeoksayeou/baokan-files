During the rectification of the communes, a comprehensive and in-depth examination should be conducted on the commune's production planning, distribution status, welfare benefits, business management, financial work, and organizational leadership. At the same time, it is necessary to earnestly rectify the Party's organization and the commune's organization, ensuring that the leading members at all levels of the Party and the commune must be activists who are loyal to the interests of the people and the cause of communism, and also to absorb outstanding elements who have been tested in the Great Leap Forward movement and the communization movement and meet the standards of Party members into the Party.

    在进行整社的时候，要对公社的生产规划、分配状况、生活福利、经营管理、财务工作、组织领导，做一次全面的深入的检查。同时，要切实整顿党的组织和公社的组织，保证党和公社的各级领导成员必须是忠实于人民利益和共产主义事业的积极分子，并且吸收在大跃进运动和公社化运动中受过考验、合乎党员标准的优秀分子入党。
