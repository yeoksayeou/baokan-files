　　Xinhua News Agency, December 1st dispatch: The speeches at today's National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists show that young activists on the industrial, agricultural, and other fronts of our country, actively responding to the Party's call for technological revolution, are constantly innovating in industrial and agricultural production and science and technology, demonstrating the role of youth shock workers.

　　The youth of the Tongguanshan Mining and Smelting Plant in Anhui Province, with the ambition and perseverance to "fiercely attack copper smelting technology and climb world peaks," successfully tested an advanced method of roasting mineral powder, which increased daily output by more than ten times compared to ordinary methods. Hu Xianzhou, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the 402 work section, who was in charge of this arduous test task, talked about the process of this test by the youth of this work section in his speech today.

　　Hu Xianzhou's speech today showed that the entire experimental process of this new technology was a process of giving full play to collective wisdom and constantly overcoming difficulties. They had conducted twenty-two trials, each of which failed. Later, thanks to everyone's active suggestions and close cooperation with relevant departments, the equipment and operating methods were improved, and with the help of Soviet experts, the twenty-third trial was finally successful.

　　Xie Yuying, a young worker from the Guangzhou Paper Mill, introduced in his speech that he proposed the "straight-line temperature increase" suggestion in the technological innovation movement, which reduced the time for steaming and cooking chemical wood pulp from the original six hours per pot to three hours and twenty-five minutes per pot, and later created new records of three hours and five minutes, and two hours and fifty-five minutes per pot.

　　Li Shuping, a youth representative from the Forestry Department of Zhejiang Province, reported on behalf of more than 100 Communist Youth League members and youth in their department about their efforts in comprehensive utilization of forest trees. In the past six months, under the leadership of the Party organization, they have created more than 100 new forest chemical products. Among them are more than a dozen kinds of chemical raw materials recovered from the waste smoke of earthen charcoal kilns, such as wood wax liquid, wood tar, and methanol; glucose extracted from Chinese fir sawdust; pine needle oil, alcohol, feed, and surgical ointment made from pine needles, and the remaining wood pulp can also be used to make rayon. In addition, there are dozens of brightly colored floral fabrics woven from dozens of kinds of wild plant fibers, and fruit wine, alcohol, and fragrant oils made from wild fruits and grass roots.

　　Zhang Huanying, a young woman from the Xianfeng People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong Province, introduced the situation of their youth technical spare-time school at the meeting. Since its establishment in 1954, this school has done many things for agricultural cooperatives. They have conducted 82 technical experiments, successfully cultivated three new varieties of wheat and five new varieties of corn, promoted the cultivation methods of narrow-row wide-row close planting of wheat and millet and double-plant seedling retention of corn, reformed the two-year three-crop cultivation system into a two-year four-crop three-harvest cultivation system, and collectively created more than 30 kinds of tools.

　　Occupational low back pain, which has always been considered difficult to cure, has now found an effective treatment method. The success of the experiment of this method was achieved by three young interns from the health center of the Fifth Engineering Section of the Second Railway Engineering Bureau. They used the "alcohol procaine solution paravertebral injection method" to treat more than 700 patients in six months, with good results, and the efficacy reached 75% to 95%. Zhang Zhaojin, one of the three young interns, spoke at the conference today.

　　A Young Pioneer reported at the conference the process of the 36 young workers in the activated carbon factory of Tianjin No. 59 Middle School trial-producing and producing activated carbon. He was Luo Tian'en, the representative of the "Red Little Eighth Route Army Shock Team" of this factory.

　　Among these 36 young workers, the youngest was 12 years old and the oldest was 16 years old. At the end of July this year, with the support of the Party branch and the specific leadership of the Communist Youth League branch, they established a factory specializing in the production of activated carbon. In the past three months, the activated carbon they produced from plant materials such as apricot kernels, reeds, sunflowers, and dandelions had a decolorization power of 250 cc. After being identified by the chemical raw material company, it was considered to be of high quality.

　　Today, a group of Young Pioneers from all over the country made a collective speech at the conference with the theme of "Making Progress Every Day." Led by the Young Pioneers' team flag, the children came to the middle of the venue to the sound of bugles and drums, marching in neat steps. Each of them was so energetic. Their clear and loud voices expressed the "red scarf" hearts that loved the Party, loved Chairman Mao, loved the motherland, and loved socialism. At the end of their speech, they said: "We want to be good children of the Party, always listen to Chairman Mao's instructions - study hard, make progress every day, be a successor to communism, and build the world into a communist paradise." The young activists were deeply moved by the pure and enthusiastic words of the Young Pioneers and applauded enthusiastically again and again.

　　Today's conference included a speech by Li Yanzhang, the sports committee member of the Communist Youth League Committee of Yushudixia Township, Beipiao County, Liaoning Province, and a joint speech by eight sports athletes, including Chen Jingkai, Zhao Qingkui, Qi Lieyun, Sun Jiaxiang, He Jianhua, Wang Zuyan, Wei Shixian, and Han Guishan, which showed that China's sports activities have achieved brilliant achievements in both popularization and improvement.

　　Li Yanzhang said in his speech that this year, Yushudixia Township has set off an unprecedented upsurge in national sports. Now there are ball racks, tracks, and playgrounds everywhere in the township, and 393 men's and women's basketball teams, 6 volleyball teams, 16 youth football teams, and more than 600 various exercise groups have been established. Before liberation, because the working people in this township lived in poverty, many young people became "hunchbacks" or "bowlegs"; now, the youth in the township have achieved "three reds": all have reached the first-level standard of the labor defense system; all have reached the level of national third-level athletes; and all have reached the standard of ordinary shooters.

　　In the joint speech of Chen Jingkai, Zhao Qingkui and others, they reported on how they persisted in diligent study and hard training, and broke world records in weightlifting, swimming, rowing, skydiving and other sports. Zhao Qingkui, who created a new world record for the motherland in the light heavyweight weightlifting competition yesterday with a clean and jerk of 177.5 kg, read this joint speech.

　　At the beginning of today's conference, Rong Gaotang, deputy director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, gave a speech at the conference entitled "Young People Temper Themselves into Iron Men and Build the Motherland into a Socialist Paradise." Rong Gaotang said that with the great leap forward in industry and agriculture and the great leap forward in culture, since this year, a upsurge of national participation in sports activities has been set off in our country. At present, more than 100 million people across the country regularly participate in exercise, and millions of qualified labor defenders and a large number of graded athletes have emerged, and dozens of world records and creators of the latest world achievements have emerged, most of whom are young people. He said that this is the result of China's sports closely combining with production and vigorously developing mass movements; it is also the result of the broad masses of people, especially the youth, emancipating their minds, daring to think and dare to do under the leadership of the Party. He hoped that the youth would realize the instructions of the Party Central Committee, not only vigorously develop mass movements in popularizing sports, but also vigorously develop mass movements in improving sports technology, so that thousands of sports armies would emerge behind every sports event, and martial arts champions would emerge in every line.

　　In today's conference speeches, there were also four young activists from schools, who continued to use vivid facts to illustrate the situation of their implementation of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. They are: Tian Shizhong, secretary of the Communist Youth League General Branch of the Department of Chemistry of Wuhan University, Xu Lu, the youth representative of Tsinghua University who designed and produced electronic computers and program-controlled milling machines, Mi Yunjuan, secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Jilin Provincial Experimental Middle School, and Ma Chizong, a student of the Department of Electrical Engineering of Harbin Institute of Technology.

　　A total of seventeen people spoke at the conference today. Among them were also Yi ethnic female militia Hai Lai Azhi from Meigu County, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Lin Tian, announcer of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, Shen Weining (joint speech), youth representative of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, and Shu Changjie, youth representative of Xi'an Medical College, Shaanxi Province.

　　The conference will continue on the 2nd.

    发挥集体智慧  攀登技术高峰
    青年积极分子在技术革命中不断创造新成就
    新华社1日讯  今天的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会发言表明，我国工农业战线和其他各个战线上的青年积极分子们，积极响应党的技术革命的号召，在工农业生产和科学技术上不断进行革新，表现了青年突击手的作用。
    安徽省铜官山矿冶炼厂的青年以“猛攻炼铜技术，攀登世界高峰”的雄心和毅力，试验成功了一种先进的焙烧矿粉的方法，这比普通的方法日产量要提高十多倍。担任这个艰巨的试验任务的四零二工段共青团支部书记胡宪周，今天在发言中谈到了这个工段青年这次试验的经过。
    胡宪周今天的发言表明，这个新技术的整个试验过程，是发挥集体智慧，不断战胜困难的过程。他们曾经前后试验了二十二次，一次一次地都失败了。后来，由于大家积极献计献策，和有关部门密切协作，改进了设备和操作方法，并且得到苏联专家的帮助，终于在第二十三次试验成功。
    广州造纸厂青年工人谢裕颖在发言中，介绍他在技术革新运动中提出“直线升温”的建议，使蒸煮化学木浆的时间由原来的六小时煮一锅缩短到三小时二十五分煮一锅，以后又创造了三小时零五分、二小时五十五分煮一锅的新纪录。
    浙江省林业厅青年代表李树平代表他们全厅的一百多个共青团员和青年，在会上报告他们大搞林木综合利用的情况。半年多来，他们在党组织领导下，共创造了一百多种新的林木化工产品。其中有从土炭窑的废烟中回收的木腊液、木焦油、甲醇等十多种化工原料，从杉木屑中提取的葡萄糖，用松针制出的松针油、酒精、饲料和外科用药膏，剩下的木浆还可以制成人造丝，另外，还有用几十种野生植物纤维织出的几十种色彩鲜艳的花布，用野果、草根等制出的果子酒、酒精和芳香油。
    山东省掖县先锋人民公社的女青年张焕英在会上介绍了他们的青年技术业余学校的情况。这所学校从1954年成立以来，为农业社做了许多事情。他们进行了八十二项技术试验，培养成功了三种小麦和五种玉米新品种，推广了小麦、谷子窄行宽幅密植和玉米双株留苗的耕作方法，把二年三作的耕作制度改革为二年四作三收的耕作制度，还集体创造了三十多种工具。
    一向被认为难以治好的职业性腰背疼痛病，现在已经找到了有效的治疗方法。试验这种方法成功的是铁路第二工程局第五工程段卫生所的三个青年实习生。他们用“酒精普鲁卡因溶液椎旁注射法”，在六个月中治疗了七百多个病人，效果良好，疗效达到75％至95％。这三个青年实习生之中的张照金，今天在大会上发了言。
    有一个少先队员，在大会上报告了天津市第五十九中学活性炭工厂的三十六个小工人试制和生产活性炭的经过。他是这个工厂的“红色小八路突击队”的代表罗天恩。
    这三十六个小工人中，最小的十二岁，最大的十六岁。今年7月底，他们在党支部的支持和团支部具体领导下，办了一个专门生产活性炭的工厂。三个月来，他们用杏核、苇子、向日葵、蒲公英等植物原料生产的活性炭，脱色力达到二百五十cc，经过化工原料公司鉴定，认为质量很高。
    今天，各地出席大会的一群少先队员以“天天向上”为题作了集体发言。孩子们在少先队队旗引导下，在铜号和铜鼓声中，迈着整齐的步伐来到了会场中间。他们一个个都是那样地精神饱满。他们的清脆而嘹亮的声音，表达出了热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱祖国，热爱社会主义的一颗“红领巾”的心。他们在发言的最后说：“我们要做党的好儿女，永远听从毛主席的嘱咐——好好学习，天天向上，作一个共产主义的接班人，把人间建设成共产主义的天堂。”青年积极分子们为少先队员们纯真而热情的语句深深感动，一再热烈鼓掌。
    今天的大会上，辽宁省北票县榆树底下乡团委体育委员李彦章的发言和陈镜开、赵庆奎、戚烈云、孙嘉祥、赫建华、王祖燕、魏诗娴、韩贵山等八位体育健将的联合发言，表明了我国体育活动在普及和提高两方面都取得了辉煌的成就。
    李彦章在发言中说，今年榆树底下乡掀起了一个空前的全民办体育的热潮。现在全乡到处有球架、跑道和操场，已经建立起男女篮球队三百九十三个，排球队六个，青少年足球队十六个和各种锻炼小组六百多个。在解放前，这个乡因为劳动人民生活贫困，有许多青年成了“驼背”或“罗圈腿”；而现在，全乡青年已经实现了“三红”：全部达到了劳卫制一级标准；全部达到了国家三级运动员的水平；全部达到了普通射手的标准。
    陈镜开、赵庆奎等人的联合发言中，报告了他们怎样坚持勤学苦练，分别在举重、游泳、划船、跳伞等项运动中打破世界纪录的事迹。宣读这个联合发言的是赵庆奎，他昨天在轻重量级举重比赛中又以挺举一七七点五公斤的成绩，给祖国创造了一个新的世界纪录。
    在今天大会开始时，中华人民共和国体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠以“青年们炼成铁打的汉，把祖国建成社会主义乐园”为题，在大会上讲话。荣高棠说，随着工农业大跃进和文化大跃进，今年以来，我国掀起了全民参加体育活动的热潮。目前全国已有一亿多人经常参加锻炼，出现了几百万劳卫制及格者和大批等级运动员，并且出现了数十个世界纪录和世界最新成绩的创造者，其中绝大部分是青年。他说，这是我国体育事业紧密结合生产，大搞群众运动的结果；也是广大人民特别是青年，在党的领导下解放思想，敢想敢干的结果。他希望青年们实现党中央的指示，不仅在普及体育方面大搞群众运动，而且在提高运动技术方面也大搞群众运动，使每一个运动项目后面都涌现成千上万的体育大军，行行都出武状元。
    今天的大会发言里，还有四位学校的青年积极分子，继续用生动的事实说明了他们执行教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合这一方针的情况。他们是：武汉大学化学系团总支书记田世忠、清华大学设计制作电子计算机和程序控制铣床的青年代表徐路、吉林省实验中学团委书记糜韵娟和哈尔滨工业大学电机系学生马持宗。
    今天在大会上发言的共十七人。他们之中还有来自凉山彝族自治州美姑县的彝族女民兵海来阿支，中央人民广播电台播音员林田，武汉钢铁公司青年代表沈维宁（联合发言），陕西省西安医学院青年代表舒昌杰。
    2日，大会将继续举行。
