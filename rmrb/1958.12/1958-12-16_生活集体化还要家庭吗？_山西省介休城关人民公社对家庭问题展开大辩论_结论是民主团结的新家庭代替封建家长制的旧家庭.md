Does Collectivized Living Still Need Families?
    A Great Debate on the Family Question in the Chengguan People's Commune, Jiexiu, Shanxi Province.
    Conclusion: New Democratic and United Families Replace Old Feudal Patriarchal Families
    According to the Shanxi Daily, after the socialist and communist ideological education movement was widely and deeply unfolded, the Party branch of the Beiliangshui Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Jiexiu County led some of its members in a great debate on a question of general concern to the masses at the time—the family question.
    After the people's commune was established, all 283 households in Beiliangshui ate in public canteens; collective welfare undertakings such as kindergartens, nurseries, and sewing factories sprang up like mushrooms. The masses were very satisfied with this change, but some confused ideas also arose among a few people. On the evening of the 4th, at a mass debate meeting held by the branch, everyone expressed their opinions freely and spoke their minds based on their own experiences, and the debate was very heated.

    Collectivized Living Does Not Mean No Families
    The first to speak at the meeting was Zhang Zidong. He said: "Now that everyone eats together, are there still small families? In my opinion, only going home to sleep every day is not called a family, it can only be called a dormitory."
    Zhang Zidong's speech raised two questions: What is a family? Are there still small families now? The debate unfolded from this question that interested everyone.
    Regarding what a family is, everyone had different opinions at first. Some said, "A pair of chopsticks and a bowl, wherever you eat is home." Some said, "Having a wife means having a home. Why else do people say that marrying a wife means settling down?" Some said, "Wherever you sleep is home. If you sleep here today, this is home, and if you go to Taiyuan tomorrow, Taiyuan is our home." These statements were not comprehensive. Finally, production team leader Ren Rulin said, "In our rural areas, before cooperativization and communization, parents, children, and families relied on raising and planting, and each family lived its own life. The upbringing and education of children were also managed by each family. This small unit of each family was the small family of the past."
    So, are there still small families now? There were two different answers to this. One said that there are no small families now. The reason is: "Now, we don't farm our own land, we don't cook our own meals, only the commune is home." "Everyone has two shoulders and a mouth, a roll of bedding and a hoe, eating their fill every day, doing whatever they are told, going wherever they are told, so what family is there?" The other view was that there are still small families. The reason is: "Families as production units, old feudal patriarchal families, are now gone or will be gone, but replacing them are new democratic and united families. After finishing work every day, the family still sleeps in the same 'pot house' (referring to home), taking care of each other in life, planning expenses together, and still raising children. If this isn't called a small family, what is it?" "Families will definitely still exist, and will be even more perfect than the old families of the past. However, there are small families and also large families. Chairman Mao leads the people of the whole country as a large family, the people's commune is also a large family, and our commune members still have a small family; such a small family can be a truly democratic, united, and harmonious family." After comparison, everyone agreed that the latter opinion was correct. Small families not only exist now, but will also exist in the future. What we are now abolishing is the feudal patriarchal system, but that does not mean we do not want family life. However, small families are no longer production units; this responsibility has been taken over by the people's commune, the collective large family. However, the kinship between parents and children still exists, the relationship between husband and wife still exists, and the family still lives in a "pot house," still enjoying a truly equal and harmonious family life after work.

    Collective Life Brings Infinite Warmth
    Ren Peisong's speech turned the debate to a second topic. He said: "Some people always miss the small family life of the past. I say, collective life is better. If we hadn't set up public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, how could the attendance rate of women's labor force have reached 96%? Without the realization of collectivized living, could there have been a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production? Could the grain yield per mu in our village have suddenly increased to over a thousand catties?"
    Is collective life warmer than the small family life of the past? The members' understanding was not consistent. Some people felt a sweetness in their hearts when they mentioned the words "small family." They said: In the small families of the past, we could eat whatever we wanted, drink whatever we wanted, and the whole family, big and small, huddled together, talking and laughing. How warm was that? But most of the people present had many painful memories of the small family life of the old society. Female member Guo Xiuying said: "Small families are not all the same! Some only eat pork and white flour, while some can't even eat anything. In this respect, I can't think of the benefits of small families. We didn't know where the next meal was coming from, worrying about cotton in winter and single layers in summer..." Statistician Ci Shihua was also a typical figure who did not like small families. He said: "In the old society, I didn't worry about family until I mentioned it. As soon as I entered the house, I lowered my head. There were many people but little labor. Even if I worked myself to death all year round, the whole family still couldn't get enough to eat. Every day, there was loud and soft crying, poor quarreling. What's there to think about in such a small family?" In the end, everyone meant the same thing: For a few wealthy people, small families were indeed "heaven," while for most people, family life in the past was simply a cage.
    Recalling the suffering of the past made them feel the sweetness of the present even more. Then, everyone eagerly talked about the benefits of collective life. The women said that in the small family life of the past, the most depressing thing was for the women. Now that there are public canteens and nurseries, women are truly liberated. Men work, and we also work. They have income, and we also earn work points. The money we spend is earned by ourselves. We no longer rely on men to live, and we are no longer subject to the anger of the head of the family. No one dares to look down on us. Children eat well and play well in the nurseries, and receive communist education from an early age. Even if they pick up a little grain from the street, they also send it to the commune. This kind of collectivist thinking cannot be cultivated under the education of small families. The collectivization of life not only liberates the productive forces, but also clears the way for the establishment of truly equal, beautiful, and happy family life. The commune stipulates that there is a large collective and also small freedom. As long as we do not violate the principles of collective production and collective life, we can still cook some meals at home and raise a few chickens. What's wrong with that?

    Will Definitely Not Become "Unrecognizable to Relatives"
    As the debate deepened, Pei Youming raised a new question. He said: I fully admit the benefits of collectivized living, but if children are sent to nurseries and kindergartens when they are very young, then live in schools, and are assigned work according to social needs after graduation, will this lead to people becoming unrecognizable to their relatives? Some people have even brought up the relationship between husband and wife, fearing that men and women will be separated. But the vast majority of members firmly believe that situations of being unrecognizable to relatives will not occur. Ren Zidong said: "Children still see you often after being sent to nurseries. How can they not recognize their fathers when they grow up?" Old man Zhao Wanlu said even more profoundly: "Old cows still 'moo' a few times if they don't see their calves for half a day. Livestock is like that, let alone people?" Finally, everyone unanimously recognized that children are their own, but also belong to everyone. We can no longer regard children as our private property, but the natural feelings between parents and children not only continue to exist, but will also become more normal and harmonious on the basis of collective life. As for the fear of separating husband and wife, that is completely unnecessary worry.

    Clear Boundaries, Relaxed Mood
    For the farmers of Beiliangshui, the debate on the family question was a concrete and vivid communist ideological education. Through this debate, the future of the family was clarified, the ideological boundaries were drawn, the doubts of some people were dispelled, the mood of the masses became more relaxed, and their labor enthusiasm for building socialism became higher. Everyone unanimously agreed that to build a new happy and beautiful family, we must first strive to increase production and consolidate and develop collective welfare undertakings.

    生活集体化还要家庭吗？
    山西省介休城关人民公社对家庭问题展开大辩论
    结论是民主团结的新家庭代替封建家长制的旧家庭
    据山西日报消息  社会主义和共产主义思想教育运动广泛深入地展开以后，介休县城关人民公社北两水生产队的党支部，领导一部分社员，就当前群众普遍关心的一个问题——家庭问题，进行了一次大辩论。
    人民公社化以后，北两水二百八十三户人家，都到公共食堂吃饭；幼儿园、托儿所、缝纫厂等集体福利事业，也如雨后春笋，相继举办起来，对于这个变革，群众都非常满意，但在少数人中也产生了若干糊涂思想。4日晚间，在支部召开的群众辩论会上，大家根据自己的亲身体验，各抒己见，畅所欲言，争论十分热烈。
    生活集体化不是不要家庭
    会上，第一个发言的是张子栋。他说：“如今，大伙在一块儿吃饭，究竟还有没有小家庭？依我看，每天光回家睡睡觉，那不叫家庭，只能叫宿舍。”
    张子栋的发言提出了两个问题，什么叫家庭？现在，还有没有小家庭？辩论就从这个使人都感兴趣的问题上展开了。
    关于什么叫家庭，开始各有各的说法。有的说：“一双筷子一个碗，在哪儿吃饭哪儿就是家。”有的说：“有老婆就有家。要不，人们为啥说娶了老婆是成了家？”有的说：“睡在哪儿哪儿就是家。今天睡在这里，这里就是家，明天上了太原，太原就是咱的家。”这些说法都不全面，最后生产队长任如林说：“在咱农村，合作化、公社化以前，父母儿女一家一户闹养种，一家一户过日子，对孩子们抚养、教育，也是各家管各家的。这一家一户的小单位，就是过去的小家庭。”
    那末，现在还有没有小家庭呢？对此，有两种不同的回答。一种说，现在没有小家庭了。理由是：“如今，自家不种地，自家不支锅，只有公社才是家。”“人人都是两个肩膀一张嘴，一卷铺盖一张铣，每天吃一肚，叫干啥干啥，叫去哪去哪，还有什么家？”另一种说法是还有小家庭。理由是：“作为生产单位的家庭、旧的封建家长制的家庭，现在是没有或将没有了，但代替它的是一个新的民主团结的家庭。每天劳动完了，一家人还要睡在一个锅舍（指家），生活上互相关照，花钱共同计划，儿女还要教养，这不叫小家庭叫甚？”“家庭肯定还有，同时比过去旧家庭更为美满，不过有小家庭，还有大家庭。毛主席领导全国人民是一个大家庭，人民公社也是个大家庭，咱社员个人还有个小家庭；这样的小家庭，才能是真正民主团结和睦的家庭。”两种意见，经过比较，大家都认为后一种意见对。小家庭不仅现在有，就是将来也还有。我们现在废除的是封建家长制，但并不是不要家庭生活。不过，现在的小家庭再不是一个生产单位，这个责任已经由人民公社这个集体大家庭担当起来；但父母子女的亲属关系还存在，夫妻关系还存在，一家人还要在一个“锅舍”里居住，劳动、工作之余，仍然享受着真正平等、和睦的家庭生活。
    集体生活带来无限温暖
    任培松的一段话，使辩论会转上了第二个题目。他说：“有些人总是想念过去的小家庭生活，叫我说，还是集体生活好，要不是办起公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，妇女劳动力的出勤率怎能达到96％？要不实现生活集体化，工农业生产能不能大跃进，咱村的粮食亩产量，能不能一下就提高到上千斤？”
    集体生活是不是比从前的小家庭生活更温暖呢？社员认识并不一致。一些人提到了“小家庭”三个字，心里就甜丝丝的。他们说：过去一家一户的小家庭，想吃甚吃甚，想喝甚喝甚，成天每日，大大小小挤在一疙瘩，说说笑笑，这有多温暖？可是在座的大多数人，却对旧社会那种小家庭生活有许多痛苦的记忆。女社员郭秀英说：“小家庭和小家庭不一样啊！有的尽吃猪肉白面，有的就甚也吃不到。在这点上我是想不到小家庭的好处，吃了上顿没下顿，冬天愁棉，夏天愁单……”统计员刺士华，同样是对小家庭不怀好感的典型人物。他说：“旧社会，我是不提家庭不发愁，一进家门低了头。人多劳力少，自己扑死扑活干一年，全家人还是吃不饱。每天大哭小嚎，穷吵穷闹。这样的小家庭有什么想头？”说来说去，大家都是一个意思：对于少数富有的人说来，小家庭确实是“天堂”，而对于大多数的人来说，过去的那种家庭生活简直是牢笼。
    回想到过去的苦，就加倍觉得现在的甜。接着，大家便争先恐后地谈论着集体生活的好处。妇女们说，从前小家庭生活，最数婆姨们败兴。如今，有了公共食堂、托儿所，妇女真正解放了。男人劳动，咱也劳动，他有收入，咱也得工分，花钱是自己挣下的，再不靠男人过活，再不受家长的气，谁也不敢小眼看。孩子们到托儿所，吃得好，玩得好，从小就受着共产主义教育。从街上拾到一点粮食，也要送到公社。这种集体主义思想，在小家庭的教育下，是培养不出来的。生活集体化不仅解放了生产力，同时也为建立真正平等、美满、幸福的家庭生活扫清了路。公社规定有大集体还有小自由，只要不违犯集体生产，集体生活的原则，自家也还可以在家里作点饭菜、养几只鸡，这有甚不好呢？
    决不会弄得“六亲不认”
    辩论进一步深入，裴有明又提出一个新问题。他说：生活集体化的好处，我全部承认，但孩子很小就送进托儿所、幼儿园，然后住学校，毕业后根据社会需要分配工作，这样会不会弄得六亲不认呢？有的还把夫妻关系也扯进来了，害怕男女分开。但绝大多数社员坚信不会发生六亲不认的情况。任子栋说：“孩子送到托儿所，还经常和你见面，大了怎能不认爹呢？”赵万禄老汉更说得深：“老牛半天不见牛犊，还要‘哞哞’地叫几声，牲畜如此，何况人呢？”最后，大家一致认识到，孩子是自己的，也是大家的。不能再把孩子看成自己的私有财产，但父母子女间的天然情感不仅一直存在，而且在集体生活的基础上，还会更加正常融洽起来。至于害怕夫妻分开的问题，那完全是多余的耽心。
    界限划清，心情舒畅
    对于北两水的农民来说，家庭问题的辩论，是一次具体生动的共产主义思想教育。通过这次辩论，闹清了家庭前途，划清了思想界限，解除了一些人的疑虑，群众的心情更加舒畅，建设社会主义的劳动热情更加高涨。大家都一致认为，要建立新的幸福美满的家庭，就必须首先努力增加生产，巩固和发展集体福利事业。（文珊、燕如、士元）
