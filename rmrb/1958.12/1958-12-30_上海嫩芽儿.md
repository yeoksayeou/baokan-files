    "Shanghai Saplings"
    Zhu Weihao

    We call the Shanghai youths who came to Wugong Mountain to participate in mountain construction "Shanghai Saplings." Now, these "saplings" have grown strong in the soil of Wugong Mountain.

    But two months ago, when those young girls received letters from home for the first time, they all secretly cried. Now, if you still ask them, "Do you still cry when you receive a letter from your mother?" they will turn around and scold you, "You blockhead!" Because connecting the words "family letter" and "homesickness" is their biggest taboo. They say, "We want to stay in Wugong Mountain for the rest of our lives!"

    Zhu Huisu from the man-made fiber factory said, "I want to be a worker in the fiber factory forever." Zhu Huisu came to Wugong Mountain with his three siblings. His sister is seventeen years old, and his younger brother is one year younger than his sister. People say they are a dragon, and Huisu is the "dragon head," so he said that this sentence also represents the wishes of the other two. When they first entered the factory, people shook their heads and said, "Oh, look at these three siblings, all they know is to cause trouble all day long." Originally, they saw that the mountains were empty, and there was no factory or machines; the factory building had to be a thatched shed, and the machines had to be replaced with those annoying wooden buckets, earth stoves, and sticks; and the food didn't suit their tastes, wax gourd was hard to swallow, and chili peppers were too spicy. They pouted all day long, unhappy.

    They thought of the tall buildings in Shanghai, thought of home, but what about home? It was just the opposite. Although their mother's letter said that she missed them, she didn't ask them to go back. Their mother said: Good son, good daughter, listen to your mother, don't be naughty, be united, work hard in the mountains, so as not to make your father angry. Their older brother wrote: Since I was transferred to the reservoir, I have been more happy than when I was in the office, I am tanned and have gained weight. Whenever I work with the laborers, I will think of you. You must be like us, out in the wind and rain, not afraid of hardship. You must work hard, happiness will not fall from the sky, you have to fight for it. Zhu Huisu thought of his mother and brother's words, and the pride and arrogance he had when he left Shanghai in front of his classmates, and his face suddenly turned red. He felt that he had done something wrong, and he had not done the right thing well.

    From then on, Zhu Huisu gradually became serious about his work. One night, when boiling alkali, he was afraid that the firewood would be wet and unable to burn, delaying work, so he asked Old Zhao to start the fire, but he couldn't sleep in bed, and he thought: Hey! If the fire is not started, will the work stop? So he immediately got up and went to learn how to start a fire from Old Zhao. The next day, he got up early and scrambled to start the fire. Huisu learned the technology of boiling alkali, and the more he worked, the more energetic he became. He used his little brain to make a frame on the alkali-boiling wooden bucket, and filtered the alkali water when scooping cotton, saving a lot of labor.

    With Huisu, the "dragon head," taking the lead, the other two also started to move. Sometimes his younger sister Huizhu was not strong enough, and his older brother and younger brother would criticize her at the life meeting: "If you don't work hard, I'll tell mom and older brother that you are a dead lagger!"

    Now, when anyone talks about this "dragon," they no longer shake their heads, but nod.

    Not only this "dragon," many Shanghai youths are "vigorous dragons" and "lively tigers," full of energy.

    They are such a group of new people! From Shanghai, but deeply in love with Wugong Mountain.

    “上海嫩芽儿”
    朱惟豪
    到武功山参加山区建设的上海青年，我们管他叫“上海嫩芽儿”。如今，这些“嫩芽儿”已在武功山的土壤里茁壮地成长起来了。
    可是在二个月以前，那些年纪轻轻的小姑娘初次接到家里的来信，都一个个偷哭过。现在，如果还问她们：“接到妈妈的信还哭吗？”那她们就会反过来骂你：“看你这死脑筋！”因为把“家信”和“想家”几个字连接起来，这是她们最大的忌讳。她们说：“我们要一辈子都在武功山哩！”
    人造纤维厂朱惠恕这样说过：“我愿意永远在纤维厂做工人。”朱惠恕是三兄妹到武功山来的。他妹十七岁，妹妹和弟弟都挨次小一岁。人家说他们是一条龙，惠恕是“龙头”，所以说，他这句话也代表了那俩人的意愿。初进工厂，人家都摇着头说：“咳，你看这三兄妹，成天只知道闹。”原来他们见着山上空空的，工厂也没有，机器也没有；厂房得盖茅棚子，机器得用那些讨厌的木桶啦、土灶啦、棍子啦代替；而且吃饭又合不来味口，北瓜难进嘴，辣椒辣死人。他们成天嘟个嘴，不高兴。
    他们想着上海的大楼，想着家，可是家呢？却恰恰相反。妈妈来信虽然说了惦念他们的话，可没叫他们回去。妈妈说：好儿子，好女儿，听妈妈的话，别淘气，要团结，在山上好好劳动，免得惹你爸生气。哥哥来信说：我自从下放到水库以后，精神比在机关时更愉快，我晒黑了，长胖了。每当和民工一起劳动的时候，我就会想起你们。你们一定也跟我们一样，风里来雨里去，不怕吃苦。你们要好好干活，幸福不会从天上掉下来，要去争取。朱惠恕想到妈妈和哥哥的话，想到离开上海时在同学面前那种自豪、骄傲的神气，脸就一下子红起来了。他觉得自己做错了事，对的事没去作好。
    打这以后，朱惠恕干活就渐渐认真起来了。有一天晚上煮碱，他怕柴湿生不着误工，就给老赵去生，可是在床上他怎么也睡不着，一想：嘿！都不生不是要停工？就马上一咕碌爬起，去学老赵生火。第二天早早的就起来抢着生火了。惠恕学会了煮碱的技术，越干越有劲，他开动了小脑筋，在煮碱木桶上作个架子，捞棉时滤了碱水，节省了好多人工。
    惠恕这“龙头”一带，他俩也就跟着动起来，有时妹妹惠珠差把子劲，哥哥弟弟就在生活会上批评她：“你还不努力我就告诉妈妈哥哥，说你是死落后！”
    现在，谁要再谈起这“一条龙”，都不再是摇头，而是点头了。
    不只这“一条龙”，许多上海青年都是“生龙”“活虎”，干劲十足。
    他们就是这样一批新人！来自上海，却深深地爱上了武功山。
