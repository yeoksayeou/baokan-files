Grandma's Thousand-Family Meal (Folk Song)
　　Zhang Yongmei

　　Grandma Li, I've just turned sixty-three,
　　The battalion commander wants me to go to the home for the elderly,
　　No matter how much he pleads, I won't agree,
　　I've become a canteen cook instead.

　　The girls and daughters-in-law go to produce,
　　I take on the cooking for the whole platoon,
　　Don't think I'm still just turning around the stove,
　　Now I'm cooking for a thousand families!

　　One pair of hands makes a thousand-family meal,
　　Every household eats with glee;
　　Ever since my canteen opened,
　　The commune members' weight keeps going up!

　　I plan cleverly when we have meat,
　　Steaming, stewing, and stir-frying three delicacies,
　　No matter how big your appetite, I'll fill you up,
　　The meals I make are free of charge!

　　The peasants have an iron rice bowl,
　　People are joyous, and my hands don't rest,
　　Raising pigs, feeding chickens, and watering the vegetable garden too,
　　My nickname is "The Day That Never Sleeps"!

　　Grandma Li, I've just turned sixty-three,
　　It's just the right time to engage in communism!
　　You ask me when I'll go to the home for the elderly,
　　I want to work for another hundred years!

    阿婆做的千家饭（小唱）
    张永枚
    李阿婆我刚满六十三，
    营长要我去敬老院，
    好说歹说我也不干，
    当上了食堂炊事员。
    姑娘媳妇们去生产，
    全排的饭菜我包干，
    别看我还是围着锅台转，
    如今我做的是千家饭！
    一双手做出千家饭，
    家家户户都吃得欢；
    自从我的食堂一开张，
    社员的体重往上添！
    逢一吃荤巧打算，
    又蒸又炖炒三鲜，
    再大的胃口也管你饱，
    我做的饭菜不要钱！
    农民有了铁饭碗，
    人逢喜事我手不闲，
    养猪喂鸡还要浇菜园，
    我有个外号叫“不夜天”！
    李阿婆我刚满六十三，
    要搞共产正当年！
    你问我几时去敬老院，
    我要再干一百年！
