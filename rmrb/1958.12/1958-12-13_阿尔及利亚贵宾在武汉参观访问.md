The guests listened to the company's General Manager Li Yiqing's introduction on the construction plan of WISCO and the current basic construction and production situation, and then visited the newly built coking workshop and ironmaking workshop.

Li Yiqing presented the guests with a picture album of "WISCO Construction in the Great Leap Forward" as a souvenir.

In the afternoon, the guests arrived at the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant amidst the cheers of the workers. They visited the processing, casting, machine repair, power and other workshops of this newly built factory, carefully observing the manufacturing process of various newly produced heavy-duty machine tools and the already assembled finished products.

When the guests learned that this factory had been successfully built one and a half years ahead of schedule this year, Minister Cherif excitedly said to the factory director Shi Ziming: "The great achievements made by the Chinese people have made China a strong fortress against colonialism. We warmly congratulate you on your achievements, because your achievements are the achievements of people who love peace and freedom." When Shi Ziming warmly congratulated the Algerian people on their victory in the struggle for national independence, and pointed out that the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world would be their backers, Minister Youssef Ben Khedda happily said: "For imperialism, your achievements are a heavy blow to them."

    李一清把“大跃进中的武钢建设”画册送给贵宾们留念。马哈茂德·谢里夫部长热情地说：“我们代表战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民，祝贺你们为了人民的幸福，为了保卫和平、自由和独立，作出更大贡献。”
    下午，贵宾们在工人们的夹道欢呼声中来到了武汉重型机床厂，他们参观了这座新建工厂的加工、铸造、机修、动力等车间，细致地观看了各种新出产的重型机床的制造过程和已经装配好的成品。
    贵宾们了解到这座工厂是在今年提前一年半建设成功的时候，谢里夫部长兴奋地对厂长史梓铭说：“中国人民所取得的巨大成就，使中国成了反殖民主义的坚强堡垒。我们热烈祝贺你们的成就，因为你们的成就就是爱好和平与自由的人们的成就。”当史梓铭热烈祝贺阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的胜利，并且指出中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都将做他们的后盾时，优素福·本·赫达部长高兴地说：“对于帝国主义，你们的成就是对它们的沉重打击。”
