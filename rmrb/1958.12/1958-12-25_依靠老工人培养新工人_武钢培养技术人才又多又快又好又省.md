    Relying on Veteran Workers to Train New Workers
    Wuhan Iron and Steel Cultivates Technical Talents More, Faster, Better, and More Economically

    (Our Dispatch) Reporters Cao Baoming and Zhang Guanwu report: Wuhan Iron and Steel Company organizes veteran workers to run spare-time technical schools on a large scale, cultivating technical workers more, faster, better, and more economically, thus opening up a new path for cultivating technical talents. At present, Wuhan Iron and Steel has established 250 such spare-time technical schools (training classes), with more than 10,000 people participating in learning.

    With the development of production, Wuhan Iron and Steel will need tens of thousands of technical workers in the future. In addition, the company is also responsible for training technical personnel for many newly built iron and steel enterprises. If it only relies on technical schools and the method of masters teaching apprentices to train technical forces, it will be far from meeting the needs. In order to solve this contradiction, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has adopted the method of veteran workers running spare-time technical schools. These technical schools adopt the method of combining leading cadres, veteran workers, and technical personnel to run schools. Instructors for technical courses are veteran workers with high technical skills who teach in their spare time, and they do not receive any remuneration; teaching materials are compiled by veteran workers according to production needs, and veteran workers with low cultural levels are assisted by technical personnel in compiling them; classrooms are workshops, work sheds, or thatched houses built by the workers themselves, and desks and benches are made from workshop workbenches or scrap wood.

    This type of technical school was founded by You Wenxiang, an eighth-grade electrician at the Automobile Team Repair Shop of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Mechanical Power Station. When the school first started, it only taught technology; after it was widely promoted in various units of Wuhan Iron and Steel, it has developed into a "red and expert" school that teaches both technology, politics, and culture. It not only trains apprentices but also trains veteran workers to become all-rounders. In teaching, this type of technical school fully implements the policy of combining theory with practice, so students understand problems quickly and deeply. For example, when You Wenxiang lectured on the automotive electrical repair section, he started with common and difficult-to-handle faults encountered by automobiles, explaining the causes of various faults, as well as the methods of inspection, repair, and testing. After the students mastered general repair techniques, he gradually delved into the necessary and more difficult-to-understand theoretical knowledge, which not only ensured that the students could quickly start working but also aroused the students' interest in learning deeper theoretical knowledge. In post-class production, veteran workers provided specific guidance to consolidate the knowledge acquired by the students. By adopting this method, apprentices can generally be trained to the third-grade technical level within three months, and the fastest have trained a lathe worker in 23 days and a crane operator in more than ten days.

    Among the trained apprentices, most are farmers and urban residents who have just entered the factory. They generally have poor organization and discipline and have some unhealthy ideas. Therefore, these technical schools pay special attention to conducting political and ideological education for the students. For example, in response to the problems of lax labor discipline, picking and choosing jobs, and restlessness among apprentices in the Fifth Company, the Party Committee Secretary and Manager took the lead, organizing cadres and veteran workers to educate the apprentices on the glorious traditions of the working class, democratic centralism, and factory rules and regulations. After two months of study, the more than 1,000 apprentices trained generally overcame their laxity, initially solved their ideological problems, and were able to work independently.

    依靠老工人培养新工人  
    武钢培养技术人才又多又快又好又省
    本报讯  记者曹葆铭、张冠五报道：武汉钢铁公司组织老工人大办业余技术学校，培养技术工人又多又快又好又省，为培养技术人才开辟了一条新的道路。目前武钢已办起这种业余技术学校（训练班）二百五十个，有一万多人参加学习。
    随着生产的发展，武钢今后需要数万名技术工人。另外，这个公司还担负着许多新建钢铁企业技术力量的培训任务，如果只依靠技工学校和师傅带徒弟的方法培训技术力量，远不能满足需要。为了解决这一矛盾，武汉钢铁公司采取了老工人大办业余技术学校的办法。这种技术学校采取领导干部、老工人、技术人员三结合的办法办学。技术课教员由技术高的老工人在业余时间担任，他们都不领取报酬；教材由老工人根据生产需要编写，文化低的老工人由技术人员协助编写；课堂是利用车间、工棚或工人自己盖的茅草房子，桌凳则利用车间的工作台或用废木料做成。
    这种技术学校，是武钢机械动力站汽车大队修理厂八级电工由文祥创办的。学校刚开办时，只学技术；在武钢各单位普遍推广后，已发展为又学技术、又学政治、又学文化的红专学校。它不仅培养徒工，还培养老工人成为多面手。这种技术学校在教学上，充分贯彻了理论和实际结合的方针，因此学员对问题理解得既快又深。例如：由文祥在讲汽车电气修理部分时，他先从汽车常遇到的较难处理的故障讲起，说明各种故障发生的原因，以及检验、修理和试验的方法。待学员掌握了一般修理技术后，再逐步深入讲解必需而又较难理解的理论知识，这样既保证了学员能够很快工作，又引起了学员学习较深理论知识的兴趣。在课后生产中，老工人又具体进行辅导，使学员们学到的知识能加以巩固。采取这种方法，一般在三个月内就能把徒工培养到三级技术水平，最快的有在二十三天内培养出一名车床工人，十多天内培养出一名开天车的工人。
    在培训的徒工中，都是刚入厂不久的农民和市民，他们一般组织性纪律性较差，存在着一些不健康的思想。因此，这些技术学校都特别注意对学员进行政治思想教育。如：五公司针对徒工中劳动纪律松弛、工作挑肥拣瘦和不安心等思想问题，由党委书记和经理挂帅，组织干部和老工人向徒工进行了工人阶级光荣传统，民主集中制和厂规制度等的教育。这样经过两个月的学习，培训出来的一千多名徒工。一般都克服了散漫性，思想问题初步获得解决，并能独立进行工作。
