    A Major Event
    "A clever woman cannot cook a meal without rice" is a saying that has been circulating in our country for thousands of years. If this sentence is interpreted as meaning that one cannot accomplish something without the basic conditions, then it is of course correct; but if it is really used in the context of cooking, it is no longer in line with the actual situation in our country. After our country's great agricultural harvest this year, "rice" is now something we can eat "to our heart's content." The question now is how the "clever woman" can turn the "rice" into even more fragrant and better food.

    "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools" is another old saying in our country. This sentence is particularly appropriate for the current work in rural public canteens in our country. In the rural public canteens of our country, the problem of "rice" has been fundamentally solved, and the problem is how to "sharpen the tools" to make food quickly and well. Don't regard the reform of cooking utensils of "sharpening the tools" as a trivial matter—it is a very big deal. After the realization of public canteens in rural areas throughout the country, how to properly solve the problem of feeding 500 million farmers is a major issue; how to reduce the labor intensity of about 10 million cooking staff and improve their work efficiency is also a major issue. If we reform the tools and double the efficiency of cooking, we can not only improve the people's meals, but also free up five million people to participate in various socialist construction undertakings. What a meaningful thing this would be! Today, our newspaper published some reports on the reform of cooking utensils, hoping that all public canteens will take this matter to heart and implement it.

    一件大事
    “巧妇难为无米之炊”这句话，曾经在我国流传了千百年。如果把这句话解释成没有起码的条件，就不能做成某项事情，当然还是正确的；如果真的用在做饭这件事情上，在我国已经不符合实际情况了。我国在今年的农业大丰收以后，“米”已是可以“放开肚皮”吃了。现在的问题是“巧妇”如何把“米”做成更香更好的饭食问题了。
    “工欲善其事，必先利其器”，又是我国一句古话。这句话用在目前我国农村公共食堂的工作上特别恰当。在我国农村公共食堂里，“米”的问题已经根本解决了，问题是怎样“利其器”把饭做得又快又好。不要把“利其器”的炊事工具改革看成是小事情——这事情大得很。全国农村实现公共食堂化以后，如何把五亿农民的吃饭问题办好是个大问题；如何把约一千万炊事人员的劳动强度减轻和提高他们的工作效率也是个大问题。如果我们改革工具把炊事工作效率提高一倍，不仅可以把人们的伙食办得更好，也可以腾出五百万人参加各项社会主义建设事业，这将是一件多么有意义的事情！今天本报发表了一些改革炊事工具的报道，希望所有的公共食堂都把这件事情做起来。
