Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 17th: The Baghdad newspaper "Voice of Free People" published an editorial pointing out that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree's visit to the Middle East this time aims to concentrate efforts on splitting the ranks of the Arabs, to force the Iraqi government to deviate from the democratic path after the revolution, and to embolden conspirators.

The editorial said that it would be very dangerous to believe that this American envoy harbors a good desire to improve relations with the Arabs. The editorial said that the purpose of this statement is to re-enslave the Arab people, and no loyal Arab will fall for this trick, no matter what his intentions are. The newspaper said that "America's shameful history" shows that Iraq has reason to suspect its envoy's visit and to be vigilant about it.

    伊拉克报纸揭穿美国阴谋
    朗特里到中东不怀好意
    新华社巴格达17日电  巴格达“自由人民之声报”发表社论指出，美国助理国务卿朗特里这次访问中东的目的是想集中力量分裂阿拉伯的队伍，想迫使伊拉克政府脱离革命以后的民主道路，并且给阴谋者打气。
    社论说，如果相信美国的这个使节抱有同阿拉伯人改善关系的良好愿望，那将是很危险的。社论说，这种说法的目的是要重新奴役阿拉伯人民，没有一个忠实的阿拉伯人会上这种当，不管他的意图如何。报纸说，“美国的可耻历史”说明，伊拉克有理由怀疑它的使节的访问，并且对此提高警惕。
