The CCP Mudanjiang Cement Plant Committee

Under the correct leadership of the Party, the Mudanjiang Cement Plant is vigorously carrying out a mass movement centered on technical revolution. All the workers and staff are constantly creating exciting miracles. The hourly output of the cement kiln has reached a high-yield level of 46.48 tons, exceeding the original design capacity by more than double, creating the highest record for the Lipol kiln. Driven by the high yield of the cement kiln, the daily output of the mine has increased from 1,100 tons to 1,400 tons; the cement mill has leaped from an hourly output of 33 tons to 58 tons; and the raw material mill has reached 82 tons from an hourly output of 58 tons, achieving an all-round bumper harvest. As production targets have been leaping again and again, this year's cement production is expected to increase by 40% compared with last year, and this growth rate is unprecedented. Now all the workers and staff are striving to double the cement production next year.

We are now actively grasping measures and technology, and many major production technical problems that have not been solved for a long time are beginning to be resolved. For example, worker Wang Yanghui boldly created the experience of repairing the dryer tire during equipment operation; electrician Hou Yuling created a magnetic flaw detector, which solved the problem of timely detection of cracks in large accessories and shaft materials, effectively preventing equipment accidents. Due to giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the production targets of each workshop have been raised again and again.

After the production target was raised, we also loudly put forward the battle slogan: "Standing on the ground, not reconciled, resolutely catch up with Xiaotun" (the hourly output of Xiaotun Cement Plant began to exceed ours), pointing out the direction, guiding and encouraging the masses to continuously leap forward, which further promoted the continuous increase of production targets.

In order to make high yield a regular occurrence, we put forward the call to carry out technical revolution on a large scale, and clarified that we must first revolutionize the kiln, and then carry out revolutions in cement mills, raw material mills, auxiliary machinery and other links. Where high yield is hindered, we will carry out revolution there.

The technical revolution of the cement kiln mainly adopted the measures of "three bigs and one fast". The so-called "three bigs" are: big wind, big feed, big fire, that is, adding more raw materials, increasing coal consumption, and increasing air volume to aid combustion. "One fast" is to make the kiln turn faster. After taking this measure, the output increased rapidly, but at the same time new contradictions and weak links were discovered. For example, after the speed of the kiln is accelerated, the raw material mill and the cement mill cannot maintain the original speed, and some auxiliary machinery must also be refitted and adjusted, which poses new topics for technical revolution.

In order to eliminate these weak links in the production process, we mobilized the masses to make full use of machine maintenance time to implement various improvement measures. After the output of the kiln and mill was increased, the Party committee timely analyzed the production situation and believed that solving the problem of replacing heavy manual labor with machinery in the mine workshop and loading and unloading workshop was a key issue. Therefore, the workers were mobilized to discuss, and the workers put forward fourteen kinds of stone mining machines. After the debate, it was finally decided to first adopt a stone mining machine that can be made from old materials immediately. One machine can replace the labor of twenty people, and the entire quarry can be completely solved with three or four machines.

From this period of work, we have realized that the cement kiln and auxiliary equipment are a unity of opposites. When the key problem of the kiln is solved, the auxiliary equipment becomes a weak link, and a new key appears, and measures must be taken to break through these keys. The important responsibility of enterprise leaders is to timely discover weak links, grasp the key to production, and take the method of carrying out mass movements on a large scale and carrying out technical revolution on a large scale to break through the key to production one after another, so that production can be continuously improved.

This is the first large-scale cement plant built during my country's first five-year plan - Datong Cement Plant. The complete set of equipment is the latest equipment supplied by Democratic Germany, and it is one of the cement plants with the highest degree of mechanization and automation in my country. The original design capacity of the plant was 450,000 tons of cement per year. After the Great Leap Forward, the output increased to 540,000 tons, exceeding the original design capacity by 20%.

    指明方向  不断跃进 
    中共牡丹江水泥厂委员会
    牡丹江水泥厂在党的正确领导下，正在蓬勃开展着以技术革命为中心的群众运动。全厂职工不断创造出激动人心的奇迹。水泥窑的小时产量已达到四十六点四八吨的高产水平，超过原设计能力一倍以上，创造了立波尔窑的最高纪录。在水泥窑高产的带动下，矿山日产量由一千一百吨提高到一千四百吨；水泥磨由时产三十三吨跃进到五十八吨；原料磨由时产五十八吨达到了八十二吨，获得了全面丰收。由于生产指标一跃再跃，今年的水泥产量预计要比去年增加40％，这个增长速度是空前的。现在全厂职工正在为明年水泥产量翻一番而奋斗。
    现在我们正积极地抓措施抓技术，很多长期没有解决的重大生产技术问题，开始得到了解决。如工人王阳辉大胆创造了在设备运转中修理干燥机轮带的经验；电工侯雨令创造了磁力探伤器，解决了及时发现大型配件及轴料的裂纹问题，有效地防止了设备事故。由于充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，各车间生产指标一再提高。
    生产指标提高以后，我们又响亮地提出：大窑“立地不甘心、坚决赶小屯”（小屯水泥厂的时产量开始超过了我们）的战斗口号，指明了方向，引导和鼓舞群众不断跃进，这样又促使了生产指标继续提高。
    为了使高产经常化，我们提出了大搞技术革命的号召，并且明确了首先要革窑的命，跟着也要在水泥磨、原料磨、附属机械等环节上实行革命，哪里阻碍高产，就在哪里革命。
    水泥窑的技术革命主要采取了“三大一快”的措施。所谓“三大”就是：大风、大料、大火，即多加原料，增加燃煤，加大风量，以助燃烧。“一快”就是使窑的转加快。采取这种措施以后，产量迅速提高，但同时又发现了新的矛盾和薄弱环节。例如窑的转速加快之后，原料磨和水泥磨维持原来的转速不行了，有些附属机械也必须进行改装和调整，这就给技术革命提出了新的课题。
    为了消除生产工艺上这些薄弱环节，我们发动群众充分利用机器检修时间，实现各项改进措施。在窑和磨的产量提高后，党委及时分析了生产情况，认为解决矿山车间和装卸车间用机械代替笨重体力劳动是个关键问题。于是发动工人讨论，工人提出了十四种采石机，又经过鸣放辩论，最后确定先采用一种马上能利用旧料制作的采石机，一台可代替二十人的劳动，整个采石场有三、四台就能全部解决问题。
    从这一段工作中我们体会到：水泥窑和辅助设备是对立的统一。当窑的关键问题解决了，辅助设备就成为薄弱环节，出现了新的关键，就必须采取措施突破这些关键。企业领导者的重要责任，就是及时地发现薄弱环节，抓住生产关键，采取大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命的办法，一个又一个的突破生产关键，使生产不断提高。（附图片）
    这是我国第一个五年计划期间新建的第一个大型水泥厂——大同水泥厂。全套设备都是由民主德国供应的最新设备，是我国目前机械化自动化程度最高的水泥厂之一。该厂原设计能力为年产水泥四十五万吨，大跃进后产量提高到五十四万吨，超过了原设计能力20％。
