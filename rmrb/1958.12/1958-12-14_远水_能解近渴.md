“Distant Water” Can Quench Immediate Thirst
　　Lin Ye

There are many benefits to planting woody oil crops. First, these woody oil crops are highly adaptable and can be planted on both plains and mountains. Developing woody oil crops in mountainous areas allows for large areas of good farmland on the plains to be converted to planting other high-yield crops. Secondly, there are many types of oil crops, some of which can be used for human consumption, while others can supply oil for industrial, transportation, and other production purposes. To meet the needs of the people's lives and the development of industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to vigorously develop woody oil crops while planting herbaceous oil crops well.

According to reports from various places, the following three ideological problems need to be resolved in the development of woody oil crop production:

Some people believe that woody oil crops have a long growth period and "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." It is true that woody oil crops have a long growth period, but is it impossible to accelerate their growth and bear fruit earlier? The on-site walnut production conference held by the Ministry of Forestry in Shangluo, Shaanxi, and other places in October this year had many facts proving that even walnuts, which have the longest growth period, can achieve rapid and high yields. Walnut trees planted in Shangxian, Shaanxi, can bear fruit in five years, which breaks the old almanac of needing more than ten years to bear fruit. Facts prove that as long as timely cultivation, fertilization, irrigation, pruning, and pest and disease control can be carried out, it is entirely possible for woody oil crops to grow and bear fruit quickly.

Some people believe that there is already insufficient labor for industrial and agricultural production, so there is no spare capacity to develop woody oil crops. It is true that labor is indeed tight in striving for a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Woody oil crops require a certain amount of labor to achieve rapid and high yields. But this does not mean that it is impossible to develop this type of production. As long as labor is arranged well, it is still possible to develop this production. Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, carried out an oil-tea camellia cultivation campaign while carrying out large-scale water control, fertilizer accumulation, and spring flower cultivation. The county's main methods were: grasping small-segment plans, grasping short-term assaults, assigning mountains to teams, assigning work to people, grasping rainy days, grasping female workers, and using all gaps to carry out oil-tea camellia cultivation. This is an example.

Some people believe that woody oil crops have obvious alternate bearing, making it difficult to maintain a stable yield year by year. We should recognize that the so-called "small years" are all caused by the backward management methods of relying on the sky for harvest in the past. Some typical facts after liberation tell us that as long as we fertilize, water, cultivate carefully, and control pests and diseases in a timely manner, we can achieve high yields year after year. The oil-tea camellias of the Zaozi Cooperative in Yongxing County, Hunan, and the walnuts in the Shimen area of ​​Lulong County, Hebei, have already eliminated the phenomenon of alternate bearing. It can be seen that it depends on human effort, and the old almanac can be completely broken.

Now, various places are gradually promoting the "three-three system" of basic farmland, with more land available for developing woody oil crops. At the same time, the grain problem has been basically solved, and people's needs for oil are increasing day by day. The situation for developing woody oil crops is extremely favorable, and the task is extraordinarily urgent. We must have the魄力 (pòlì - boldness/courage/daring) to turn the country's barren mountains into seas of oil trees, and we must work hard to produce more woody oil crops.

    “远水”能解近渴

    种植木本油料的好处很多。首先，这种木本油料适应性强，平原山地都能种植。在山区发展木本油料，就可以让出平原上大面积的良田改种其他高产作物。其次油料种类繁多，其中有的油可以供人食用，有的可以供应工业、交通等生产用油。为了满足人民生活和工农业生产发展的需要，必须在种好草本油料的同时，大力发展木本油料。
    根据各地反映，在发展木本油料生产中，有下列三个思想问题需要解决：
    有人认为木本油料生长期长，“远水不解近渴”。木本油料生长期是长，但是不是不可以加速成长，提早结实呢？在今年10月林业部在陕西商雒等地召开的核桃生产现场会议上有许多事实证明，就是生长期比较最长的核桃，也能够快速丰产。陕西商县栽的核桃树五年就可以结果，这就打破了十年以上才能结果的老皇历。事实证明，只要能够及时抚育、施肥、灌溉、修枝、防治病虫害，木本油料快生长快结果是完全可能的。
    有人认为搞工农业生产劳力尚且不足，哪有余力发展木本油料。不错，在争取工农业生产大跃进中，劳力确实是紧张的。木本油料要实现快速丰产，需要一定的劳力。但这决不是说，发展木本油料就不可能了。只要劳力安排得好，还是可以发展这种生产的。浙江省青田县在进行规模巨大的治水、积肥、培育春花的同时，开展了油茶抚育运动。该县的主要办法是：抓小段计划，抓短期突击，划山到队，派工到人，抓雨天，抓女工，利用一切空隙进行油茶抚育。这就是一个例证。
    有人认为木本油料结果的大小年比较明显，因而逐年保持稳定的产量比较困难。我们应该认识，所谓“小年”，都是由于过去靠天收的落后经营方法造成的。解放后的一些典型事实告诉我们，只要施肥浇水，精耕细作，及时防治病虫害，就可以连年丰产。湖南永兴县枣子社的油茶，河北卢龙县石门地区的核桃，就都已经消灭了结果大小年的现象。可见事在人为，老皇历完全可以打破。
    现在各地正在逐步推行“三三制”的基本农田制，有更多的土地可以发展木本油料；同时粮食问题已经基本解决，人们对油料的需要正在与日俱增，发展木本油料的形势是极为有利的，任务也是异常迫切的。我们要有把全国的荒山变成油山树海的魄力，要为生产更多的木本油料而努力。
