Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 10th: According to investigations by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' High Mountain Ice and Snow Utilization Research Team, the total area of modern glaciers in the Qilian Mountains exceeds one thousand square kilometers, with a water storage capacity of over thirty billion cubic meters.

With the strong support of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' High Mountain Ice and Snow Utilization Research Team this year formed a high mountain expeditionary force composed of twenty units, including research institutes and schools. They divided into seven routes, traversing the major mountain ranges of the Qilian Mountains.

This year, the meltwater volume of the Qilian Mountains' glaciers is approximately 800 million cubic meters. If artificial methods are used to promote melting, the meltwater volume can be greatly increased. This will not only increase the amount of snowmelt water in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu and increase the number of irrigations for existing cultivated land, but also ensure the water needs of newly built industries and forestry in the Hexi Corridor.

    冰川——丰富的水利资源
    据新华社兰州10日电  根据中国科学院高山冰雪利用研究队考查，祁连山里现代冰川总面积超过一千平方公里，储水量超过三百亿公方。
    中国科学院高山冰雪利用研究队，在中共甘肃省委的大力支持下，今年由研究所、学校等二十个单位，组成了一支高山远征大军，分兵七路，踏遍祁连山区的各大山脉。
    今年，祁连山的冰川溶水量大约有八亿立方公尺，如果加以人工促进，溶水量还可以大大增加。这样，不仅可以提高甘肃河西走廊雪水的水量，增加现有耕地的灌水次数，而且可以保证河西走廊新建工业用水和林业用水的需要。
