    Commentary on the Xiangqi Competition of the 1958 National Chess Tournament
    Chen Songshun, Qin Jianqiu
    The 1958 National Chess Tournament's Xiangqi competition, held in Guangzhou, began on November 20th and concluded on the evening of the 7th, after seventeen days of intense competition.
    Eighteen chess players from four regions, including Yangzhou, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, and Guangzhou, participated in this competition. The results were as follows: Li Yiting from Wuhan won the championship, He Shunan from Shanghai took second place, Yang Guanlin from Guangzhou came in third, Zhang Donglu from Harbin secured fourth place, Liu Yici from Hangzhou finished fifth, and Xu Tianli from Shanghai claimed sixth place.
    Unprecedentedly Fierce Battle
    This year's Xiangqi competition witnessed an unprecedentedly fierce battle due to the generally improved skill levels of chess players from various regions, with newcomers demonstrating sharp killing moves and established masters facing setbacks one after another. Yang Guanlin, who had won two national championships, won the first four games in a row. After the fifth game, he was defeated by Liu Yici and Zhang Donglu respectively, falling behind Li Yiting and Xu Tianli in points. Later, Xu Tianli and Li Yiting were defeated by Zhu Deyuan from Guangzhou and Shen Zhiyi from Wenzhou, allowing Zhang Donglu from Harbin to catch up. However, this situation did not last long. After defeating Dai Guangjie and Shen Zhiyi, Yang Guanlin once again took the lead. But just at this moment, He Shunan from Shanghai, who had initially performed modestly, unexpectedly defeated Ren Dechun, Liu Yici, and Zhang Donglu, leaping to first place. The chess tournament proceeded in such a rapidly changing and complex situation, with the champion only being decided in the final game.
    Champion Li Yiting
    Li Yiting, who ranked ninth in last year's National Xiangqi Tournament, has now jumped to first place in Chinese Xiangqi. This twenty-one-year-old young chess player has gained rich combat experience after two national chess tournaments. Therefore, in this year's competition, although he was once frustrated by Shen Zhiyi, affecting his score, he was still able to fight calmly to the end in the fierce matches against Ren Dechun and Wang Jialiang, achieving final victory.
    Runner-up He Shunan
    He Shunan from Shanghai, who ranked sixth in the 1956 National Xiangqi Tournament, achieved second place this year with an undefeated record. He Shunan's chess skills were already well-known in his early years. A major reason for his runner-up finish this year is that his health is better than in 1956. When he participated in the 1956 National Chess Tournament, he had the conditions to compete for the championship in terms of chess skills. However, because he was suffering from a serious lung fluke disease that severely damaged his health, his physical condition was extremely poor. He could still hold on during the preliminary and semi-final rounds, but he collapsed in the final. Last year, the government sent him to the hospital for treatment, and the medical expenses were borne by the government. After one hundred days of treatment, his long-standing and tormenting illness was cured. Due to improved health, in this year's competition, he reversed the phenomenon of lacking stamina in 1956, becoming more courageous as he fought, winning several consecutive games in the final few rounds.
    Why did Yang Guanlin Fall to Third?
    Yang Guanlin, who had won two consecutive national championships, fell to third place this year. What is the reason for this? The main reason is that the level of chess skills in our country has greatly improved, and many chess players now pay attention to the opening. Yang Guanlin is no longer the only chess player who is good at openings. A few years ago, Yang Guanlin entered the Chinese chess world with his painstakingly practiced openings, winning more and losing less. Now this situation has changed. However, Yang Guanlin is still striving to improve as new talents emerge. For example, a few years ago, many people in the chess world thought that Yang Guanlin's endgame skills were not good, mainly because his openings were too rigorous, and the endgame had no opportunity to perform. However, in recent years, Yang Guanlin's endgame skills have become famous throughout the country. Precisely because of this, Yang Guanlin was still able to rank among the top this year.
    Fighting Tenaciously to the Last Game
    A gratifying phenomenon in this year's competition is that most chess players are high in fighting spirit and are not affected by victory or defeat. For example, Liu Yici from Hangzhou lost several games in a row at the beginning of the competition, but he did not lose heart. Finally, in the fifth game, he defeated the strong opponent Yang Guanlin, and in the sixth game, he defeated Shen Zhiyi. This second-best player from the Yangzhou region lost several games in a row in the second stage of the competition, and the hope of being in the top six was very slim. But he still insisted on the competition. As a result, in the eleventh game, he defeated Li Yiting, and in the fourteenth game, he defeated Wang Jialiang. This tenacious fighting spirit of not caring about victory or defeat and fighting to the last game is a new phenomenon in this year's chess world.
    Novel Openings, Bringing Forth New Ideas
    Another new phenomenon in this national chess competition is that the openings have made great progress. This is the product of the great liberation of chess players' minds under the situation of the national Great Leap Forward. In the past, it was believed that the "Fighting Opposite Cannon" for the second player was complex and difficult to master, but this situation was widely used in this year's competition. Liu Yici and Zhang Donglu successively defeated Yang Guanlin with the "Fighting Opposite Cannon" opening. In addition, some openings that were considered "unorthodox" and that famous players were not willing to use in the past have been innovatively and flexibly applied by chess players this time, and good results have been achieved. The richness and variety of Xiangqi openings will greatly benefit the rapid improvement of chess skills in the future.
    New Waves Push the Old, Newcomers Emerge
    Many new chess players have emerged in this competition, among which the more prominent ones are two worker chess players, one is Zhang Donglu from Harbin, and the other is Meng Liguo from Shenyang. Zhang Donglu, a twenty-three-year-old Communist Youth League member and advanced producer, has successively defeated Yang Guanlin, the national champion of the previous session, and Liu Yici, who was third in the nation last year. Meng Liguo was the runner-up in the 1957 Shenyang workers' competition and made a splash in this year's national competition. He is good at fierce and rapid attacks and is also good at killing elephants to enter the endgame. He is one of the fiercest in this chess competition. In his game against Li Yiting, he used fierce attacks in the middle game to take away Li Yiting's two elephants. Although he eventually drew due to slightly less experience, his fierce killing method has spread throughout the chess world. In addition, Zhu Deyuan from Guangzhou, Chen Xinquan from Chengdu, and others are all new players who pose a great threat to other players.

    棋坛风云
    1958年全国棋类锦标赛的象棋比赛述评
    陈松顺  覃剑秋
    在广州进行的1958年全国棋类锦标赛象棋比赛，从11月20日开始，经过十七天战斗后，已经于7日晚上结束。
    参加这次比赛的有来自扬州、天津、郑州以及广州等四个赛区的十八名棋手，比赛结果：武汉李义庭获得冠军，上海何顺安亚军，广州杨官璘第三名，哈尔滨张东禄第四名，杭州刘忆慈第五名，上海徐天利第六名。
    战斗空前激烈
    今年象棋赛，由于各地棋手棋艺水平普遍提高，新手杀着锋利，成名好手先后受挫，比赛出现了空前激烈的争夺场面。曾经获得两届全国冠军的杨官璘，在开始四场比赛中，接连获胜，第五场以后，分别被刘忆慈和张东禄击败，落在李义庭、徐天利的分数后面。后来，徐天利、李义庭又被广州朱德源和温州沈志奕击败，给哈尔滨张东禄追了上来。这一形势也没保持好久，杨官璘在战胜戴光洁、沈志奕后，再度领先。但是，正在这个时候，初战成绩平平的上海何顺安，异军突起地战胜任德纯、刘忆慈、张东禄，一跃而上第一位。棋赛就在这样千变万化、错综复杂的局面下进行，直到最后一局，冠军才能决定。
    冠军李义庭
    去年全国象棋赛名列第九的李义庭，今年一跃成为中国象棋第一名。这位二十一岁的年青棋手，经过两次全国棋赛之后，取得了丰富的战斗经验，因而在今年的比赛中，中间虽然曾经一度受挫于沈志奕，影响了积分，但在对任德纯、王嘉良的激烈比赛中，还是能够冷静战斗到底，取得最后胜利。
    亚军何顺安
    1956年全国象棋赛名列第六的上海何顺安，今年以不败纪录取得了亚军。何顺安的棋，是早年就已经闻名的了，这次得亚军，有一个主要原因是他身体比1956年健康了。他在1956年参加全国棋赛时，在棋艺上来说，争夺冠军是有条件的。但是因为他那时患有严重损害健康的肺吸虫病，身体健康情况极坏，在初复赛时还能支持，决赛时就一蹶不振。去年，政府送他到医院诊治，医疗费由政府负担；经过一百天治疗，把他这个痛苦缠绵的老病治好了。由于健康好转，在今年比赛中，他一反1956年时后劲不继的现象，越战越勇，最后几场比赛中接连获胜。
    杨官璘为何退居第三？
    蝉联两届全国冠军的杨官璘，今年退居第三，这是什么原因呢？主要是我国棋艺水平大大提高，许多棋手都重视布局，杨官璘已经不是唯一擅长布局的棋手。几年前，杨官璘以他苦心练就的布局进入中国棋坛，胜多负少，现在这种形势已经变了。但杨官璘在新人辈出时也还是在力求上进。比如前几年棋坛上许多人都认为杨官璘残棋不行，主要是那时他布局太严密，残棋没有表演机会。但是近年来，杨官璘的残棋却已经名闻全国了。正因为如此，所以杨官璘今年还能够名列前茅。
    顽强战至最后一局
    今年比赛中，有一个可喜现象是：棋手们绝大部分是斗志昂扬，不因胜败影响斗志。如杭州刘忆慈一开赛接连败阵，但他并没有灰心，终于在第五场力克强敌杨官璘、第六场胜沈志奕。这个扬州赛区第二名好手在第二阶段比赛中接连败阵，前六名的希望已经很渺茫了。但他还是一样坚持比赛，结果在第十一场击败李义庭，十四场击败王嘉良。这种不计胜败，战至最后一局的顽强战斗精神，是今年棋坛的新气象。
    布局新颖  推陈出新
    这次全国棋赛另一个新气象是：布局有了很大进步，这是在全国大跃进形势下，棋手思想大解放的产物。过去认为后手“斗顺炮”复杂，不易掌握，今年比赛中这局面却用得很普遍。刘忆慈、张东禄先后以“斗顺炮”局胜杨官璘。另外，过去一些被认为“偏局”、名手不大肯走的局面，这次棋手们也把它推陈出新地灵活运用起来，并且取得了很好战绩。象棋布局的丰富多彩，将大大有利于以后棋艺水平的迅速提高。
    后浪推前浪  新手涌现
    这次比赛涌现出不少新进棋手，其中较突出的是两个工人棋手，一个是哈尔滨的张东禄，另一个是沈阳的孟立国。二十三岁的共青团员、先进生产者张东禄，曾经先后击败上届全国冠军杨官璘和去年全国第三名的刘忆慈。孟立国是1957年沈阳职工的亚军，在今年参加全国比赛中一鸣惊人。他擅长凶狠的快速攻法，又擅于杀象入局，是这次棋赛中顶凶悍的一个，他对李义庭比赛时，中局时就以凶悍的攻法，打去了李义庭的两个象，最后虽因经验稍差促成和局，但他的凶悍杀法，已经传遍棋坛。此外，还有广州朱德源，成都陈新全等都是对别的选手有很大威胁的新手。
