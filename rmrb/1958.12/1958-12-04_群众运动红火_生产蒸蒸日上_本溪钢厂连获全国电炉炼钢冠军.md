    Mass Movement is Booming, Production is Steadily Increasing
    Benxi Steel Plant Continues to Win National Electric Furnace Steelmaking Championship
    (Our newspaper, Benxi, December 3rd) The mass movement launched by Benxi Steel Plant, centered on vigorously promoting technological revolution and learning from and catching up with advanced models in the red flag competition, has created an unprecedented leap forward in production.

    From January to August, the plant only completed 57.4% of its annual steel production plan. At that time, some people were skeptical about completing this year's leap forward plan. However, since the vigorous promotion of the mass movement, the situation has undergone tremendous changes. Production is steadily increasing. In September, the first month after the launch of the mass movement, the plant completed the monthly plan six days ahead of schedule, and the average daily steel production increased by 34.3% compared with August. October also saw the monthly plan completed six days ahead of schedule, with average daily steel production increasing by more than 20% compared with September. The utilization coefficient of electric furnaces surpassed that of Dalian Steel Plant, winning the national electric furnace steelmaking red flag. In November, production advanced to a new and higher level, with the cold charge electric furnace utilization coefficient (tons of steel produced per million volt-amperes of the electric furnace transformer per day and night) reaching 43.588, an 8% increase compared to the 40.377 in October, continuing to be the national electric furnace steelmaking champion. Due to the rapid progress in production levels, current indications are that the plant's steel production this year will increase by more than 55% compared to last year, completing this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule.

    Benxi Steel Plant's vigorous promotion of the mass movement first involves disclosing production plans and other information to the workers and masses. Then, the plant's Party organization, leading cadres, workers, and technicians, focus on key production issues, adopting both practical and theoretical approaches, to conduct extensive airing of views, debates, and continuous ideological revolution, management system revolution, and technological revolution. On the basis of criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, over the past three months, a series of innovations have been made to the plant's technical operating procedures and various major equipment. For example, they boldly expanded the electric furnace shell, increasing the tonnage capacity by about double, which can increase steel production by more than 2,000 tons per month; they innovated operating methods, adopting new technologies such as enhanced reduction, external deoxidation, and gas-assisted dissolution, which shortened the smelting time of each furnace of steel from the past three to four hours to about two hours.

    (Our newspaper, Benxi, December 3rd) While Benxi Steel Plant is making a great leap forward in steel production, it has also achieved great success in expanding the variety of steel products. From the beginning of this year to date, the plant has successfully trial-produced and put into production a total of ninety-two new steel types, almost twice the number of new steel types put into production throughout last year.

    The vast majority of these new steel types were not produced in our country in the past, including various boron steels, magnetic steels, non-magnetic steels, high-grade heat-resistant and acid-resistant steels, and high-grade stainless steels, all of which are essential for the manufacture of precision machine tools, automobiles, tractors, ships, generators, and other equipment.

    Changing the past practice of a few people monopolizing the development of new steel types and actively relying on the strength of the masses inside and outside the plant to develop new steel types is the main reason why Benxi Steel Plant can accelerate the expansion of new product production. In the past, some technicians at the plant held mysterious views on expanding new steel types, not only daring not to experiment boldly themselves, but also not believing in the strength of the masses. This year, their thinking began to be liberated, and they broke through the small circle of a few people monopolizing the work. The vast majority of new steel types were discussed with workers and directly trial-smelted in production electric furnaces; at the same time, as long as the country needed them, they tried every possible means to trial-smelt them, even if there were no existing materials to refer to, thus accelerating the speed of successful trial-smelting of new products. For example, when trial-smelting boron steel, the furnace often broke down, affecting the experiment. After discussing and brainstorming with the workers, they proposed using magnesia sand particles to fill the outside of the magnesia sand crucible and placing asbestos cloth on the edge. At the same time, they used acidic and alkaline refractory materials, finally overcoming the difficulties and quickly smelting boron steel. In the process of trial-smelting new products, they also actively sought the help of scientific research institutions and users.

    群众运动红火  生产蒸蒸日上
    本溪钢厂连获全国电炉炼钢冠军
    本报本溪3日电  本溪钢厂开展的以大搞技术革命和学先进赶先进的红旗竞赛为内容的群众运动，给生产创造了空前跃进的新局面。
    1月至8月，这个厂只完成全年钢产量计划的57.4％。当时有些人对完成今年的跃进计划抱着怀疑态度。但是自从大搞群众运动以后，情况有了极大的变化。生产蒸蒸日上。全厂在开展群众运动后的第一个月——9月份，就提前六天完成了月计划，钢的平均日产量比8月份提高了34.3％。10月份也提前六天完成了月计划，钢的平均日产量又比9月份提高了20％以上，电炉利用系数赶过大连钢厂，获得全国电炉炼钢红旗。11月份，生产又跨进了一个新的更高水平，冷装电炉利用系数（电炉变压器每百万伏安昼夜产钢吨数）达到四十三点五八八，比10月份四十点三七七提高了8％，继续成为全国电炉炼钢的冠军。由于生产水平突飞猛进，从目前情况看，全厂今年的钢产量可比去年提高55％以上，将提前完成今年的跃进计划。
    本溪钢厂大搞群众运动，首先是把生产计划等向职工群众交底，然后，厂的党组织领导干部、工人和技术人员，围绕生产关键问题，采用虚实并举的办法，进行大鸣大放大辩论，不断地进行思想革命、管理制度上的革命和技术革命。在批判右倾保守思想的基础上，三个多月来，对全厂的技术操作规程和各种主要设备，进行了一系列革新。例如：他们大胆地扩大了电炉炉壳，把吨位能力扩大了一倍左右，每个月就可以增产钢二千多吨；革新了操作方法，采用强化还原、炉外脱氧、煤气助溶等新技术，使每炉钢的溶炼时间从过去的三至四小时缩短到二小时左右。
    本报本溪3日电  本溪钢厂在钢产量大跃进的同时，在扩大品种方面也取得了很大成绩。从今年年初到目前止，全厂已试炼成功投入生产的新钢种共有九十二种，差不多等于去年全年投入生产的新钢种的二倍。
    这些新钢种，绝大部分是我国过去没有生产过的，其中包括各种硼钢、磁钢、无磁钢、高级耐热耐酸钢，高级不锈钢等，都是制造精密机床、汽车、拖拉机、轮船、发电机等设备所必需的。
    改变过去少数人包办，积极依靠厂内厂外的群众力量来发展新钢种，是本溪钢厂能够加快扩大新品种生产的主要原因。过去，这个厂有些技术人员对扩大新钢种抱着神秘观点，不仅自己不敢大胆试验，而且也不相信群众的力量。今年，他们的思想开始解放，并冲破了只是少数人包办的小圈子，绝大部分新钢种都是同工人商量，直接在生产电炉上试炼的；同时，只要国家需要，即使是没有现成资料可查，也千方百计地想办法试炼，这样就加快了新品种试炼成功的速度。如试炼硼钢时，炉子老坏，影响试验，经过同工人研究想办法，提出用镁砂粒塞在镁砂制成的坩埚外边，边缘放石棉布，同时采用酸碱性耐火材料，终于克服了困难，迅速炼成了硼钢。在试炼新品种过程中，他们还主动争取科学研究机关和用户的帮助。
