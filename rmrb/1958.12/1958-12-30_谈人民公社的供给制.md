    On the Supply System of People's Communes
    Tan Zhenlin
    In our vast People's Communes, a distribution system combining wages and supply has already been implemented. This is a creation, a development of a system once implemented during our twenty-plus years of revolutionary war.

    During the twenty-plus years of revolutionary war, our army, local working organs, and support-the-front teams, numbering tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and sometimes tens of millions, implemented a supply system with wartime communist characteristics. This was a system adopted under extremely difficult conditions at the time. This supply system in the army and organs continued until the early days of liberation. It left a great impact on the people. All liberated areas, including the old southern Soviet areas, were affected, encompassing nearly 200 million people. If we add the impact during the early days of national liberation, then it had an impact of varying degrees throughout the country.

    The distribution system combining wages and supply is based on the wartime supply system and the current economic development conditions, that is, produced under the conditions of a great leap forward in agriculture, especially in grain. This distribution system is basically a socialist distribution system of distribution according to labor, and the supply part of it contains communist elements of distribution according to need. This distribution system is suitable for the current development of productivity in our country and is the urgent demand of the vast number of commune members. It takes into account both households with more labor and households with less labor and more people, and ensures that all commune members receive reliable social security. Even those households with more labor, compared to a purely wage-based distribution, have a relatively reduced income, but generally speaking, their actual income has still increased. At the same time, if they encounter special circumstances and their labor force suddenly decreases, they can still receive reliable social security and are also satisfied. This distribution system is not only an excellent distribution system under the current economic conditions, but it will also be an excellent distribution system in the future when the social economy has undergone a tremendous development. The only difference is that the scope of supply will gradually expand, and the supply standards will gradually increase.

    Why must we still implement a wage system based on distribution according to labor now? Because this distribution system not only has its due role in promoting the production enthusiasm of commune members at present, but also, when social products are not yet abundant, the implementation of this distribution system is extremely beneficial to promoting production. People receive their wages and can freely choose the goods they need. For example, those without burdens or with lighter burdens can purchase some higher-end consumer goods, while those with burdens or with heavier burdens can choose some lower-end consumer goods. This can both guarantee the different needs of people in different situations and promote the development of the production of various different commodities.

    When we emphasize this point, some people may not understand it. The reason for not understanding is a misunderstanding of communism, thinking that as long as everyone is equally flat, it is called communism. In fact, equal flatness is not communism, but egalitarianism. Communism is distributed according to need, which requires a great development of production, an extreme abundance of social products, plus many other conditions to be realized. Egalitarianism is not feasible. Can men talk about egalitarianism with women? No man can give birth to a child like a woman, so he cannot demand to eat eggs and brown sugar like a woman who has just given birth. Southerners cannot compare with northerners in wearing leather coats. If people in Guangdong wear leather coats for six months a year like people in Northeast China, they will not be able to survive.

    Everyone's needs are different, and it is impossible to fully meet the needs of every individual in the era before entering communism. The adoption of a distribution system according to labor can appropriately take into account the different needs of each individual. The supply system is naturally an advanced system. We only advocate the food supply system at present, not because the supply system is not good, but because the development of production has not yet reached the conditions sufficient to implement a larger-scale supply system. If we reluctantly implement it, it will inevitably hinder the development of production, which will not be of much benefit to the consolidation and development of the People's Commune.

    谈人民公社的供给制      
    谭震林
    在我们的广大的人民公社里，已经实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，这是一个创举，是我国二十多年革命战争时期曾经实行过的一种制度的发展。
    在二十多年的革命战争中，我们的军队，地方工作机关，支前队伍，几十万人、几百万人、有时是成千万人实行过战时共产主义性质的供给制，这是在当时十分困难的条件下所采用的一种制度，这种供给制在部队和机关中，一直实行到解放初期。它留给人民以很大的影响，所有解放区包括南方老苏区的人口在内，它影响所及，将近有二亿多人口，如果加上全国解放初期的影响，那么在全国范围内都有了不同程度的影响。
    工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，是在战时供给制的基础上和当前经济发展的条件下，即在农业特别是粮食出现了大跃进的条件下产生的。这种分配制度，基本上仍然是按劳分配的社会主义性质的分配制度，而其中供给部分则是带有按需分配的共产主义因素的。这种分配制度，是适合我国当前生产力的发展的，是广大社员的迫切要求。它既照顾了劳动力多的户，又照顾了劳动力少人口多的户，并使所有社员都得到了可靠的社会保险。就是那些劳动力多的户，和完全按工资制分配来比较，相对地减少一些收入，但总的说来，他的实际收入还是增加了的。同时，如果遇到特殊情况，劳动力突然下降了，他仍可以得到可靠的社会保险，也是满意的。这种分配制度不仅在目前的经济条件下是一个优良的分配制度，就是在将来社会经济有了一个极大的发展，也还会是一个优良的分配制度，不同的只是供给的范围会逐步扩大，供给标准会逐步提高。
    为什么现在我们还必须实行按劳分配的工资制呢？因为这种分配制度不仅在目前对促进社员生产积极性有它应有的作用，而且在社会产品尚不丰富的时候，实行这种分配制度对促进生产是有极大的好处的。人们领得了自己的工资，就可以自由地选购所需要的商品，例如没有负担或负担较轻的人，可以购买一些较高级的消费品，有负担或负担较重的人，就可以选购一些较低级的消费品。这样既可以保证不同情况的人们的不同需要，又可以促进各种不同商品生产的发展。
    当我们强调这一点的时候，可能有些人是不大通的，不通的原因就是对共产主义有一种误解，以为只要大家一样平，就叫共产主义。其实一样平不是共产主义，而是平均主义，共产主义是按照需要来分配的，这就必需使生产有极大的发展，社会产品极大丰富了，加上其他许多条件才能实现。平均主义是行不通的，男人能和女人讲平均主义吗？没一个男人能够像女人一样生下一个小孩来，因此他就不能要求和女人坐了月子一样吃鸡蛋，吃红糖。南方人不能和北方人比穿皮大衣，广东人如果也像东北人一样一年穿六个月皮大衣，就过不下去了。
    各人的需要是不同的，在没有进入共产主义的时代，是不可能完全满足每一个人的需要的。采用按劳分配制度，就可以适当照顾到各个人不同的需要。供给制自然是一个先进的制度，我们在目前只提倡伙食供给制，并不是供给制不好，而是生产发展尚未到达足以实行更大范围的供给制的条件，如果勉强去实行，就必然会阻碍生产的发展，这对人民公社的巩固和发展，好处并不多。
