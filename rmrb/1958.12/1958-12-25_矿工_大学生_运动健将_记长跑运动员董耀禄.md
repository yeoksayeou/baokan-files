    Miner, College Student, Athlete
    — A Profile of Long-Distance Runner Dong Yaolu
    Tao Kai
    Mention Dong Yaolu, and many people, especially long-distance runners, will recognize him. He is an outstanding long-distance runner from the Beijing Mining Institute, who has achieved certain successes in long-distance running. He won the championship once and the runner-up twice in the annual Beijing Spring Festival City Ring Race. In the 1958 Higher Education Games, he broke the Beijing university record for the 5,000-meter race. At the same time, he and his teammates from the Mining Institute's long-distance running team maintained the championship in the Three Good Cup cross-country race for three years. Since the Great Leap Forward in sports, he has further realized the importance of sports serving politics, serving production, and serving national defense. He is determined to study diligently, train hard, dedicate his body to the country's coal mining industry, and strive to reach the athlete standard in sports performance. On November 3rd this year, in the national marathon competition, Dong Yaolu completed the entire course in two hours, thirty minutes, and twenty seconds. His result broke the national record and reached the athlete standard. His wish to become an athlete has been realized.
    Those unaware of the inside story might think that Dong Yaolu must have loved sports since childhood. In fact, he only started participating in physical exercise in 1952. He is a college student from a coal miner's background. In the old society, he suffered the exploitation of capitalists and imperialists. People saw him as a "coal black," and excessive physical labor had destroyed his body since childhood. After liberation, under the guidance and cultivation of the Party, he came to the Qinhuangdao Coal Mine Workers' Accelerated Middle School to study. Due to intense studying, coupled with the suffering in the old society, his body was very weak. He suffered from stomach problems and neurasthenia, which seriously affected his studies. At this time, the Party pointed out the direction for him. With the help of doctors, he participated in physical exercise. Initially, he overcame various difficulties with tenacity. He understood that exercising and strengthening his physique was a task entrusted to him by the Party. Gradually, he fell in love with sports activities, especially long-distance running, and his sports performance continued to improve. This is how he became a long-distance runner. His illness was cured, his body became much stronger, and his academic performance also greatly improved. From 1953 onward, during his two years in the accelerated middle school, his academic performance was consistently excellent, and he was awarded the title of "Excellent Student."
    After coming to the Mining Institute, his studies were relatively challenging, but he studied with perseverance, diligence, modesty, and a down-to-earth spirit, firmly mastering every subject, never letting go of any small problem. His grades quickly ranked among the best in the class, with most of his subjects being excellent. In 1955, he was awarded the title of "Three Good Student" in Beijing. From the first grade, he served as the Party branch secretary of his class. Now he is a member of the school's Party committee and a representative of the Beijing People's Congress. Heavy studies and intense training have not affected his work. He sees all three as tasks entrusted to him by the Party, arranges them reasonably, seizes the time, and achieves an all-round leap forward. He is also very concerned about his classmates and can maintain close contact with the masses. In his own words, that is that an excellent athlete must be both red and expert.
    Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind. Dong Yaolu always keeps this motto in mind. He is always so humble and sincere. He does not feel jealous of those who perform better than him but learns from them with humility. At this year's Northern Suburbs College Track and Field Games, a student from the Aviation Institute overtook him. He took the initiative to learn from the other student's training experience and overcome his own shortcomings. He does not blindly believe in national records or world records, nor does he think that these are unattainable. However, he is very serious and diligent in regular training and never slacks off.
    Dong Yaolu is not satisfied with the achievements he has made. He regards physical exercise as a guarantee of being both red and expert. He continues to train hard and improve his sports level. He is determined to challenge the world record at the National Games next year!

    矿工·大学生·运动健将
    ——记长跑运动员董耀禄  
    陶铠
    提起董耀禄，许多人、特别是长跑运动员，都认识他。他是北京矿业学院的优秀长跑运动员，在长跑运动上取得了一定的成绩。在每年一度的北京市春节环城赛跑中，得过一次冠军，两次亚军，在1958年的高等学校运动会上打破了五千公尺的北京市高校纪录，同时，他和矿院长跑队员们一齐保持了三年的三好杯越野赛冠军。体育大跃进以来，他进一步认识到体育为政治服务，为生产服务，为国防服务的重要性，他决心勤学苦练，练好身体为祖国的煤矿事业献出自己的一切力量，同时，争取在运动成绩上达到健将标准。今年11月3日在全国马拉松比赛中董耀禄用二小时三十分二十秒的时间跑完全程，他的成绩破了全国纪录，并达到运动健将标准。他成为一个运动健将的愿望实现了。
    不知内情的人大概会认为董耀禄一定从小就喜爱运动。其实，他是1952年才开始参加体育锻炼的。他是一个煤矿工人出身的大学生，在旧社会他受尽了资本家和帝国主义的压榨，人们把他看成一个煤黑子，过度的体力劳动使他的身体从小就受到了摧残。解放后，他在党的教导和培育下，来到秦皇岛煤矿工人速成中学学习。由于紧张的学习，再加在旧社会遭受的摧残，他的身体很瘦弱，闹胃病、神经衰弱，严重地影响了学习。这时党给他指出了方向，在医生的帮助下，他参加了体育锻炼。起初，他用顽强的毅力克服了各种困难，他明白锻炼身体、增强体质是党交给他的任务，渐渐他爱上了体育活动，尤其对长跑感到了兴趣，运动成绩也不断地提高。就这样他成了一个长跑运动员。病好了，身体也壮实得多了，学习成绩也有很大提高，从1953年以后在速成中学的两年里，学习成绩一直是五分，被评为优等生。
    来到矿院后他的学习是比较吃力的，但他以坚毅、刻苦、虚心、踏实的精神进行学习，牢固地掌握了每一门功课，从不放过任何一个细小的问题，成绩很快就在全班名列前茅，绝大部分功课全是五分。1955年被评为北京市的三好学生。从一年级起他就担任班上的党支部书记，现在他是学校的党委委员、北京市人民代表，繁重的学习和紧张的锻炼都没有影响他的工作，他把三者都看成是党交给他的任务，合理安排，抓紧时间，做到全面跃进。他对同学也非常关心，能密切联系群众。用他自己的话来说，那就是一个优秀的运动员必须是又红又专。
    虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，董耀禄时刻铭记着这句名言。他永远是那样谦虚、诚恳，对比自己成绩好的人不是妒忌，而是虚心学习。在今年北郊高校田径运动会上，航空学院的一位同学赶过了他，他就主动地去学习人家的锻炼经验，克服自己的缺点。他不迷信什么全国纪录、世界纪录，不认为这些是高不可攀的，但在经常的锻炼中却非常认真刻苦从不懈怠。
    董耀禄并没有满足已经取得的这些成绩，他把体育锻炼看成是红透专深的保证，他继续顽强地进行锻炼，提高运动水平。他决心在明年全运会上向世界纪录冲击！
