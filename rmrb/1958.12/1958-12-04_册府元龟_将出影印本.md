    "Cefu Yuangui" to be Published in Facsimile Edition
    "Cefu Yuangui," one of the four famous books of the Song Dynasty, will be reprinted and published by Zhonghua Book Company. "Cefu Yuangui" consists of one thousand volumes and includes rich historical materials from before the Song Dynasty, which is of great reference value for studying pre-Song history. This book has not been reprinted for three hundred years, and very few copies remain. The new version will be reproduced in facsimile using a combination of surviving Song Dynasty printed fragments and Ming Dynasty editions.

    “册府元龟”将出影印本
    宋代著名的四大书之一“册府元龟”，将由中华书局翻印出版。“册府元龟”共一千卷，包括宋代以前丰富的历史资料，对研究宋以前的历史有重要的参考价值。这部书三百年来未经翻刻，存书极少。新的版本将用宋刻残本和明刻本配合影印。
