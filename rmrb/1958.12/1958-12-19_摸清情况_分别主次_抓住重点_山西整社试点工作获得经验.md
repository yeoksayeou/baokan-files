Grasping the Situation, Distinguishing Between Primary and Secondary, Grasping the Key Points
    Shanxi's Experiences in Rural Socialist Education Movement Pilot Work
    (Our Newspaper) Taiyuan Report – In the pilot work of rectifying People’s Communes, Shanxi Province started with the problems that various places urgently need to solve, and carried out rectification by focusing on ideology, production, livelihood, management, distribution, and work style, according to urgency. This not only centrally solved the main aspects of the commune that urgently needed rectification, and quickly put the commune work on the right track, but also gradually deepened the rectification work around the main aspects.
    Shanxi Province generally started earlier with the pilot work of rectifying People's Communes, and there are more than one hundred pilot sites in the province. At the beginning of the investigation phase, the pilot work groups, through investigation and research, found that since the establishment of the communes, they had not had time to be rectified due to the busy rural work, and that the People's Commune was a completely new thing, so there was a lack of experience in all aspects. Therefore, there were some problems within the various communes. For example, some cadres concealed production output and made surprise expenditures of public funds; some were not actively investing labor in the unified production arrangements of the current commune; the production order was relatively chaotic, and phenomena such as wasting labor, inefficiency, etc. were affecting the consolidation of the commune and the development of production. The work groups and the Party committees in various places studied these situations and believed that the rectification of the commune must be carried out in accordance with local conditions and with emphasis, and then gradually deepen and comprehensively. If we start with a comprehensive approach, it will inevitably disperse the leadership force, and it will be difficult to solve all the problems thoroughly. Therefore, each work group adopted the method of solving the important problems first, and solving the urgent problems first, and specifically studied the situation and problems of the commune, and focused on rectifying the main aspects according to the degree of importance and urgency.
    Generally, the pilot communes started by solving ideological problems, and closely integrated the rectification work with production. The work groups found in their preliminary investigations that the various problems existing in the communes were closely related to the ideology of the cadres and the masses. To solve specific problems, it is necessary to first solve ideological problems. If ideological problems are not solved, and the problem is only discussed on its own merits, not only will the specific problems not be solved well, but also it will be difficult to consolidate after solving them. Therefore, each work group and the commune Party committee firmly grasped the communist propaganda and education activities, first enabled the members to draw a clear line in their thinking, and then solved specific problems. In this way, many entangled problems were easily solved. The Dongfeng Commune in Xinding County is composed of more than forty agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and plain areas. Some cadres and members of the agricultural cooperatives in the plain area believed that they were at a disadvantage because of the mountainous area cooperatives, and the cadres and farmers of the mountainous area cooperatives felt that they were benefiting from the wealthy cooperatives and were afraid that this would affect unity if they were idle. In response to these ideas, the commune Party committee launched members to speak out and debate on the one hand, and compared the past, looked at the present, and looked forward to the future to carry out comparative education, and further enabled members to see the favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries brought about by the combination of mountains and plains through the formulation of commune production plans. After the members concretely saw the advantages of the commune, they unanimously believed that as long as everyone wholeheartedly does a good job in running the commune, they can ensure that everyone benefits. After the various pilot communes clarified right and wrong and unified their understanding, they firmly grasped the problems in production, and achieved that both commune rectification and production were not delayed. Generally, specialized leading bodies were established, unified deployment, unified forces, and unified actions were taken, and production movements such as wheat field management, winter basic construction, and fertilizer accumulation were launched while the commune was rectified.
    According to the different problems existing in the various pilot communes, the contents of rectification were also different. Some pilot projects started with the rectification of current production management. For example, some commune work groups in the Jin Southeast District have explored a set of new labor management methods suitable for commune promotion, that is, taking politics as the commander, taking collectivization, militarization, combat readiness, and democratization as the basis for implementing fixed tasks, fixed investment, fixed work, fixed fertilizer, and fixed quality (five fixings), so that the division of labor and cooperation are combined; specialization and all-round ability are combined; long-term and temporary rushes are combined to establish a production responsibility system. After this method was initially promoted, it avoided the phenomenon of labor chaos and began to be orderly. In some communes in the Jinan area, because the autumn harvest distribution work had not yet been arranged, the members were not aware of the amount of income and their production enthusiasm was not high. The work group promptly mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate a distribution plan, and in the distribution, promptly took three measures to subsidize some members who might reduce their income by extracting a portion of the autumn income; determining living standards according to different bases; and developing sideline production to ensure that they increased their income. Some communes paid attention to summarizing the experience of democratic commune management of the original agricultural cooperatives during the rectification, and stipulated new systems for implementing democratic management in the future, combined with speaking out and checking to correct the bad work style of individual cadres who had forced orders and bureaucracy; and changed the phenomenon that there were many people and complicated matters but no one was responsible.

    摸清情况  分别主次  抓住重点
    山西整社试点工作获得经验
    本报讯  山西省在整顿人民公社试点工作中，根据各地目前迫切需要解决的问题着手，按照缓急分别抓思想、抓生产、抓生活、抓管理、抓分配、抓作风进行整顿。这样既集中地解决了公社急需整顿的主要方面的问题，使公社工作迅速走向正轨；同时，围绕主要方面使整社工作逐步走向深入。
    山西省各地人民公社整顿试点工作动手一般较早，全省共有整社试点一百多个。各试点工作组，在开始摸底阶段，通过调查研究发现各公社建立以来，由于农村工作繁忙，没有来得及整顿，加以人民公社是个全新的事物，各方面都缺乏经验，因此在各个公社内部存在一些问题。如有的干部隐瞒产量、突击花公积金；有的对当前公社统一安排的生产不积极投入劳动力；生产秩序比较混乱，窝工浪费、工作效率不高等现象，都影响着公社的巩固和生产的发展。各地工作组和党委研究了这些情况，认为整社必须因地制宜，有重点地进行，然后逐步深入全面。如果一开始全面抓势必会使领导力量分散，问题都难以解决透。因此，各工作组都采取了啥重要先解决啥，啥急迫先解决啥的办法，具体研究公社的情况问题，分别轻重缓急先抓主要方面进行整顿。
    各个试点公社一般的都是从解决思想问题入手，并使整社工作紧密结合生产进行。各试点工作组在摸底中发现公社中存在的种种问题都和干部、群众思想紧紧相关，要解决具体问题必先解决思想问题，如果思想问题不解决，就事论事，不仅具体问题解决不好，而且解决后也难以巩固。因此，各个工作组和公社党委紧紧抓住共产主义宣传教育活动，先使社员们思想上划清界限，然后解决具体问题。这样，使许多纠缠不清的问题都迎刃而解。忻定县东风公社是由山区和平川四十多个农业社组成的，平川地区的农业社有些干部和社员认为吃了山区社的亏，山区农业社干部和农民觉得沾富社的光怕落闲话影响团结。公社党委针对这些思想，一面发动社员鸣放辩论，一面比过去、看现在、展望将来进行对比教育，并通过制订公社生产规划，使社员们进一步看到由于山川结合给生产带来全面发展农林牧副渔业的有利条件。社员们具体看到了公社的优越性后，一致认为，只要大家一心一意把公社办好，就能保证你好我好大家好。各个试点公社经过明辨是非认识统一以后，紧紧抓住解决生产中的问题，做到了整社生产两不误。一般都建立了专门领导机构，统一部署，统一力量，统一行动，在整好社的同时掀起了麦田管理、冬季基本建设、积肥等生产运动。
    各地整社试点根据不同的存在问题，整顿的内容也不同。有的试点从整顿当前生产管理开始，如晋东南专区有些整社工作组已摸索出了一套适合公社推行的劳动管理新办法，即以政治为统帅，以集体化、军事化、战斗化、民主化为基础实行定任务、定投资、定工、定肥料、定质量（五定），使分工与协作相结合；专业与全能相结合；长期与临时突击相结合建立生产责任制。这一办法初步推行后避免了劳动混乱现象，开始做到有条不紊。晋南地区有些公社就因秋收分配工作还没有安排好，社员们对收益多少不摸底，生产情绪不高。工作组及时发动群众讨论制定了分配方案，并在分配中对一部分可能减少收入的社员及时采取从秋季收入中抽出一部分进行补贴；按不同基础确定生活标准，开展副业生产等三项办法，保证他们增加了收入。有的公社在整顿中注意总结了原来农业社民主办社的经验，规定出今后实行民主管理的新制度，结合鸣放检查纠正了个别干部存在的强迫命令和官僚主义等不良作风；并改变了人多事杂而无人负责的现象。
