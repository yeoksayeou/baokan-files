    Educating Children to Love Labor
    Our kindergarten has been established for eight years now. When it first started eight years ago, we had only a dilapidated open-air house, a reed mat, a water bucket, and two small rubber balls. Over the years, through our efforts, the kindergarten has not only been consolidated but has also gradually grown stronger. Currently, it accommodates 130 children and is very popular among the masses.
    We believe that the kindergarten is not only for the purpose of providing childcare for commune members, enabling mothers to work in the fields with peace of mind, but also must provide children with some necessary education. We take the children to the fields to see the labor of their fathers and mothers. For example, during the golden harvest of rice, we explain to them that this is the fruitful result of your fathers' and mothers' labor, and the rice we eat every day is exchanged for their labor. In order to arouse children's interest in labor, enrich their wisdom, and cherish the fruits of labor, we often let them do some things they are capable of doing. For example, when it is warm in spring, we plant flowers in the garden and let the children participate in loosening the soil and planting. When morning glories and trumpet vines bloom in summer, they are very happy to see them. Some children say, "Auntie, let me plant them myself next year!" Through these activities, the children understand that labor can create everything, and the fruits of labor do not come easily. Some children used to be pampered at home by their parents and could not even do simple tasks. Now they can help their mothers sweep the floor and tidy up the house when they go home.

    教育孩子热爱劳动
    我们幼儿园从成立到现在已八年了。八年前刚开办时，只有一间露天的破房子、一领炕席、一个水桶和两个小皮球。几年来，经过我们的努力，幼儿园不仅得到了巩固，而且逐步发展壮大起来，目前已收托一百三十名孩子，很受群众欢迎。
    我们认为，幼儿园不光是为社员托管孩子，使母亲能够安心下地干活，还必须使孩子受到一些应有的教育。我们领着孩子到田里参观爸爸、妈妈们的劳动。比如在金黄色稻子丰收的时候，向他们说明这是你们爸爸、妈妈劳动的丰收果实，我们每天吃的大米都是他们劳动换来的。为了使孩子们对劳动发生兴趣，丰富孩子们的智慧，珍惜劳动果实，经常让他们做一些能做的事情。如春天暖和时，我们在花园里栽花，让孩子们也一起参加松土、栽培。在夏季喇叭花和金钟花盛开了的时候，他们看了都非常高兴。有的孩子说：“阿姨，明年你让我亲手栽啊！”经过这些活动，使孩子们懂得劳动能创造一切，劳动果实来之不易。有些孩子过去在家多受父母溺爱，连一点简单活都不会做，现在回家已能帮助母亲扫地、收拾屋子。
