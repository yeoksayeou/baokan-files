Let the Flower of China-Cambodia Friendship Bloom More Splendidly
Zhang Qian, Head of the Chinese Women's Delegation to Cambodia

The Chinese Women's Delegation, consisting of nine members, paid an eight-day friendly visit to Cambodia from November 23rd to December 1st at the invitation of Queen Monivong Kossamak of the Kingdom of Cambodia. In Phnom Penh, the beautiful capital of Cambodia, we joined the simple, kind, and hospitable Cambodian people in celebrating their traditional festival—the annual three-day Water Festival. We had the honor of participating in the grand festival ceremony presided over by His Majesty the King and Her Majesty the Queen and watched the boat races. We visited the Red Cross and Women's Association led by Princess Rasmi Sobbhana, and had cordial and friendly contacts with women from all walks of life. In addition to Phnom Penh and the neighboring Kandal Province, we visited three other provinces: Kampong Cham on the banks of the Mekong River, Siem Reap on the north shore of Tonle Sap Lake, and Kampot on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. We visited schools, hospitals, museums, factories, textile villages, rubber plantations, tobacco production cooperatives, and poultry and livestock breeding centers; toured scenic spots and historical sites; admired the magnificent and splendid architecture and sculptures of the famous ancient capital of Angkor; and enjoyed Cambodia's unique music and dance. Through these visits, we increased our knowledge of Cambodia's history and current situation and deepened our understanding of the Cambodian people, especially Cambodian women.

During the visit, we received meticulous care and a grand reception from the King, Queen, and Prime Minister Sihanouk. When visiting various provinces, we were warmly welcomed by local officials, led by the provincial governors, and their wives. Wherever we went, the neat ranks of the Royal Socialist Youth League were particularly eye-catching in the welcoming crowds. There were also numerous Cambodian and overseas Chinese students, shoulder to shoulder, waving the national flags of China and Cambodia, and shouting "Long live China-Cambodia friendship" to greet us. This scene fully demonstrated the kinship and deep friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia. Indeed, many overseas Chinese have intermarried with Cambodians, forming family ties; and many Cambodian friends often told us sincerely that they have blood relations with Chinese people. We were immensely gratified to see the harmonious coexistence and close relationship between overseas Chinese and the people of their adopted country.

During the visit, we deeply felt the sincere friendship of the Cambodian people towards the Chinese people. At the art evenings or performances hosted by our hosts for the delegation, we heard songs specially composed to praise China-Cambodia friendship and saw dance programs that expressed China-Cambodia friendship in the form of national dances from both countries. In particular, a dinner party personally arranged by Prime Minister Sihanouk at the Angkor site deeply moved us. The dinner party was held on a wide stone platform in front of the Angkor temples. From the entrance to the stone platform, we had to pass through a long stone corridor with gradually rising steps. That night, rows of oil lamps covered with red paper lined both sides of the corridor, extending from the entrance to the stone platform serving as the performance stage. Under the bright moonlight, the clear night sky set off the silhouettes of the ancient temples and towering palm trees. The quiet and solemn scenery, the grand and lively scene of the mass gathering, and the national songs and dances performed by Cambodian youth and students left us with a deep and unforgettable impression. The last program of the evening was a performance of a Chinese dance by a group of innocent and lovely elementary school girls, accompanied by the familiar tune of "Picking Tea and Catching Butterflies." From this, we saw that cultural exchanges and mutual visits between the two countries have sown the seeds of friendship and blossomed into flowers of friendship among the people; and friendship in turn promotes cultural and economic ties and exchanges between them.

As envoys of Chinese women on our first visit to Cambodia, we felt even more deeply the profound friendship of Cambodian women towards Chinese women. From the grand reception given to us by the Queen; the close contact with Princess Rasmi Sobbhana; the company of Mrs. Fang Bingzhen (Member of Parliament), the chairman of the reception committee; to the warm welcome from the women's community; all embodied the sisterly affection of Cambodian women for Chinese women. Princess Rasmi Sobbhana personally guided us to visit the Red Cross and Women's Association she leads, and warmly introduced us to the work of these two organizations and the situation of Cambodian women. Through her introduction, we learned about the work done by the Red Cross and the Women's Association in mobilizing women's strength to participate in social relief and welfare undertakings, and in uniting women, safeguarding women's rights and children's happiness. We also learned that the rights and status of Cambodian women are increasingly being valued, and that women have more opportunities for education and employment. During the visit, we met with female workers, teachers, nurses, and students. We conveyed the friendship and respect of hundreds of millions of Chinese women to our Cambodian sisters.

Cambodia and China have had similar experiences of suffering in history. Both our countries have suffered from long-term enslavement and oppression by colonialism. After freeing ourselves from the shackles of colonialism, both our countries are urgently demanding to engage in peaceful construction to change the long-standing backward situation. Although our two countries have different social systems, due to the same past experiences and common aspirations now, it is quite natural that our two peoples sympathize with and care for each other and support each other in the struggle to safeguard independence and defend peace, and in our respective construction undertakings. Therefore, when we see every progress made by Cambodia, a friendly country with a long history and ancient culture, after embarking on the road of independent development, we cannot help but feel particularly excited and happy.

We are happy to see that, under the leadership and promotion of Prime Minister Sihanouk, Cambodia is beginning to establish and develop its own industry. Among the projects we visited, two factories were built and put into operation only in the past one or two years. Not long ago, Prince Sihanouk proposed a policy of developing water conservancy, calling on all provinces to dig ponds and build dams to store river water for irrigation and develop agricultural production. Prime Minister Sihanouk also advocates labor domestically, and sets an example by personally leading officials to the countryside to help helpless rural women build houses. Due to the influence of his advocacy and practical actions, some officials and intellectuals have also begun to participate in labor. We have also seen news in the newspapers about civil servants, youth, and militiamen from various places participating in the excavation of waterways and the construction of embankments and sluice gates. From these examples, it can be predicted that the atmosphere of advocating labor will have a significant impact on Cambodian social life.

Cambodia possesses fertile land, abundant products, and undeveloped resources, which means that it has the conditions and potential to build itself into a strong and prosperous country. We believe that under the correct leadership of their leader, Prime Minister Sihanouk, the Cambodian people will unite and use their hard work and wisdom to build their own country, develop an independent national economy and culture, and they will certainly be able to create an infinitely bright future for the prosperity and strength of Cambodia.

Prime Minister Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia, regardless of all obstacles, adhere to the peaceful and neutral policy of not participating in military blocs, not allowing foreign countries to establish military bases on Cambodian territory, and being willing to develop friendly relations with all countries. This is particularly worthy of our respect. Cambodia's adoption of a peaceful and neutral policy in international relations not only conforms to the interests of Cambodian national independence, but is also conducive to peace in Asia and the world.

Looking back at the development of China-Cambodia friendly relations in the past three years is exciting. Since Prince Sihanouk's first visit to China in February 1956, the long-standing but once interrupted traditional friendship between China and Cambodia has been restored on the basis of the Bandung Conference spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the same year, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Cambodia, enhancing friendly cooperation between the two countries. Since then, cultural exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between China and Cambodia have been developing day by day. In July this year, Prime Minister Sihanouk initiated the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia, and led the delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia to visit China again, which undoubtedly marks that the friendly relations between China and Cambodia have entered a new stage of development.

It is precisely at such a time worth celebrating that our Chinese Women's Delegation is honored to accept the kind invitation of the Queen of the Kingdom of Cambodia and visit our friendly neighbor. What makes us proud is that the Chinese Women's Delegation has faithfully fulfilled the glorious mission entrusted to it by Chinese women, expressing the friendship of Chinese women to Cambodian women and people; through friendly visits, close ties have been established between women of China and Cambodia, and mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries have also been enhanced.

Finally, let me quote a passage from Prime Minister Sihanouk: "The flowers of friendship between our two countries are blooming more splendidly than before. However, unlike the fate of all other flowers that wither in an instant, the flowers of friendship between our two countries will always maintain their freshness and beauty for us."

Our Chinese women and the people of the whole country also hold the same sincere wish and will do everything possible to make the flower of China-Cambodia friendship bloom more splendidly! (Attached pictures)

    让中柬友谊之花更加灿烂
    中国访问柬埔寨妇女代表团团长  张茜
    中国妇女代表团一行九人，应柬埔寨王国摩尼旺·柯沙玛克王后的邀请，从11月23日到12月1日，在柬埔寨进行了为时八天的友好访问。在柬埔寨美丽的首都金边，我们同纯朴善良、殷勤好客的柬埔寨人民一起，欢度了他们国家的传统佳节——一年一度连续三天的送水节；我们荣幸地参加了国王、王后陛下亲自主持的节日观礼的盛典，观看了划船比赛。我们参观了拉斯美王姑所领导的红十字会和妇女协会，同妇女界人士进行了亲切友好的接触。我们访问的地方，除了金边和邻近它的干丹省外，还有湄公河畔的磅湛、洞里萨湖北岸的暹粒、暹罗湾海滨的唝吥三个省。我们参观了学校、医院、博物馆、工厂、纺织村、橡胶园、烟草生产合作社、家禽和畜牧饲养中心；游览了名胜古迹；瞻仰了著名古都吴哥的雄伟瑰丽的建筑与雕刻艺术；欣赏了柬埔寨独具风格的音乐和舞蹈。通过参观访问，使我们增长了有关柬埔寨的历史与现状的知识，使我们加深了对柬埔寨人民、特别是对柬埔寨妇女的了解。
    在访问期间，我们受到国王、王后、西哈努克首相无微不至的亲切关怀和隆重的接待。赴各省访问时，都受到以省长为首的地方官员及夫人们的热情欢迎。我们所到之处，在欢迎的行列中，皇家社会主义青年团的整齐的队伍总是特别引人注目。还有人数众多的柬埔寨青年学生同华侨青年学生，他们肩并肩，手上挥舞着中柬两国的国旗，高呼“中柬友谊万岁”的口号，夹道相迎。这种景象充分显示出中柬两国人民之间亲戚般的联系和深厚的友谊。的确，有不少华侨同柬埔寨人互通婚姻，结成了亲戚；而许多柬埔寨朋友也常常恳切地对我们说，他们与中国人有血统关系。我们亲眼看到华侨同侨居国人民友睦相处、亲密无间，感到无比的快慰。
    在访问期间，我们深深感受到柬埔寨人民对待中国人民的真诚友情。在主人为代表团举行的艺术晚会或表演会上，我们听到专为歌颂中柬友谊而作的歌曲，看到以中柬两国民族舞蹈的形式来表现中柬友谊的舞蹈节目。特别是西哈努克首相在吴哥胜地亲自安排的一次晚会，更使我们深为感动。这个晚会是在吴哥石窟前面宽阔的石坛上举行的，从入口处通往这个石坛，要经过很长一条逐段升高的石廊。这天晚上，两行用红纸罩盖的油灯，排列在长廊的两边，从入口一直通到作为演出舞台的石坛面前。皎洁的月光下，明朗的夜空衬托出石窟古刹和挺拔的棕榈树的轮廓。如此宁静肃穆的景色，盛大而热烈的群众晚会的场面，柬埔寨青年学生演出的富于民族色彩的歌舞，给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。晚会的最后一个节目，由一群天真烂漫的小学女学生，在人们熟识的采茶扑蝶调的伴奏下，表演中国舞蹈。从这里我们看到，两国的文化交流和相互访问，在人民中播下了友谊的种子，开放出友谊的花朵；而友谊又促进着彼此间文化、经济的联系和交往。
    作为中国妇女的使者初次访问柬埔寨，我们更深深感受到柬埔寨妇女对待中国妇女的深厚友情。从王后对我们的隆重接待；拉斯美王姑同我们的亲密接触；接待委员会主席方秉桢夫人（国会议员）的陪同参观；以至妇女界对我们的热情欢迎；无不体现着柬埔寨妇女对于中国妇女的姊妹般的情谊。拉斯美王姑亲自引导我们参观她所领导的红十字会和妇女协会，热情地向我们介绍这两个团体的工作和柬埔寨妇女的情况。通过她的介绍，我们了解到，红十字会和妇女协会在动员妇女的力量参加社会救济和福利事业，在团结妇女、维护妇女权利和儿童幸福等方面所进行的工作。我们还了解到，柬埔寨妇女的权利和地位，正日益得到重视；妇女受教育和就业的机会也有所增加。在参观中，我们会见了女工、女教师、女护士、女学生们。我们向柬埔寨妇女姊妹们转达了亿万中国妇女的友情和敬意。
    柬埔寨同我国在历史上有着相同的苦难经历，我们两个国家都遭受过殖民主义长期的奴役压迫。在挣脱了殖民主义加在我们身上的枷锁之后，我们两国又都迫切要求从事和平建设，以改变长久以来的落后状况。尽管我们两国社会制度不同，但由于过去相同的遭遇和现在的共同愿望，我们两国人民在维护独立、保卫和平的斗争中，在各自的建设事业中，互相寄予同情和关怀，互相支持，正是十分自然的。因此，当我们看到，柬埔寨这样一个具有悠久历史和古老文化的友邦，走上独立发展的道路之后所取得的每一进步，不禁感到特别兴奋和愉快。
    我们高兴地看到，在西哈努克首相的领导和推动下，柬埔寨正开始建立和发展自己的工业。我们参观的项目中，有两个工厂就是最近一两年才建成开工的。不久前，西哈努克亲王提出发展水利的政策，号召各省挖塘筑坝、贮蓄河水，以利灌溉，发展农业生产。西哈努克首相还在国内提倡劳动，并且以身作则，亲自率领官员下乡，帮助孤苦无靠的农妇盖房子。由于他的倡导和实际行动的影响，有些官员和知识分子也已开始参加劳动。从报纸上也看到各地公务员、青年、民兵参加挖掘水道，修筑堤防和水闸的消息，从这些事例看来，可以预料，提倡劳动的风气，将在柬埔寨社会生活中产生重大的影响。
    柬埔寨拥有肥沃的土地、丰富的物产、尚未开发的资源，也就是说，具备着使它建设成为一个富强国家的条件和潜力。我们相信：柬埔寨人民在他们的领袖西哈努克首相正确领导之下，团结一致，以他们的辛勤劳动和智慧来建设自己的国家，发展独立的民族经济和文化，他们一定能够为柬埔寨的繁荣富强，开拓无限美好的前途。
    西哈努克首相和柬埔寨王国政府不顾一切阻挠，坚持奉行不参加军事集团、不允许外国在柬埔寨领土上建立军事基地、愿意同一切国家发展友好关系的和平中立政策，这一点特别值得我们尊重。柬埔寨在国际关系中采取和平中立政策，不仅符合于柬埔寨民族独立的利益，而且是有利于亚洲和世界的和平的。
    回顾最近三年来中柬友好关系的发展是令人兴奋的。自从1956年2月，西哈努克亲王首次访华，使中柬两国之间历史悠久但一度被迫中断的传统友谊，在万隆会议精神和五项原则的基础上，重新恢复起来。同年，周恩来总理访问柬埔寨，增进了两国间的友好合作。此后，中柬两国的文化交流和经济贸易往来日益开展。今年7月，西哈努克首相倡议中柬两国正式建立外交关系，并率领柬埔寨王国政府代表团再度来中国访问，毫无疑义，这标志着中柬两国友好关系进入了一个新的发展阶段。
    正是在这样值得庆贺的时候，我们中国妇女代表团荣幸地接受柬埔寨王国王后的盛情邀请，访问了我们友好的邻邦。使我们引为自慰的是：中国妇女代表团忠实地执行了中国妇女赋予它的光荣使命，向柬埔寨妇女和人民表达了中国妇女的友情；通过友好访问，在中柬两国妇女之间建立了亲密的联系，同时也增进了两国人民的相互了解和友谊。
    最后，让我在这里引用西哈努克首相的一段话：“我们两国之间的友谊花朵开放得比以前更加灿烂。但是，同所有其他瞬息就雕谢的花朵的命运不同，我们两国的友谊之花，对我们来说，将永远保持它们的清新和美丽。”
    我们中国妇女和全国人民也怀着同样真诚的愿望，并且将尽一切努力，让中柬友谊之花更加灿烂！（附图片）
