    The only current method for smelting aluminum is the electrolytic method, and smelting aluminum requires electricity. Smelting one ton of aluminum requires 27,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity; however, the current electricity supply is very tight. How can we find a sufficient and inexpensive power source for our aluminum plants? We suggest combining the small, indigenous aluminum plants that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is promoting with the small and medium-sized hydropower stations that are being widely built in rural areas. This would provide the aluminum industry with a reliable power source, allowing it to develop rapidly. For the power industry, fully utilizing small and medium-sized hydropower stations to solve the electricity needs of the aluminum industry can significantly reduce the pressure on large power grids and large power bases, which is also a "soldier against soldier, general against general" approach.

    Last winter and this spring, over 3,000 medium-sized water conservancy projects were completed nationwide. If fully utilized, they could generate 1 million kilowatts of electricity. However, only 100,000 kilowatts are currently being utilized. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has already requested that all water conservancy projects capable of generating electricity should do so. The scale of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring is even larger, and if some of the electricity generated is used to supply small aluminum plants, it would be beneficial to all parties.

    Combining small aluminum plants with small and medium-sized hydropower stations has a series of advantages, in addition to the previously mentioned benefits of ensuring the electricity supply for the aluminum industry and reducing the power supply strain on large power grids and bases.

    First, the construction speed of small and medium-sized hydropower stations is fast, which can keep up with the construction speed of small aluminum plants, making it easy to coordinate. If generating equipment is added to existing small and medium-sized reservoirs, the time required would be even shorter.

    Second, manufacturing small and medium-sized hydroelectric equipment does not require large machines or imported, expensive materials. The process is also relatively simple, and most provinces can solve it themselves.

    Third, building small aluminum plants near hydropower stations can save transmission lines and transmission costs, thereby saving a large amount of copper and aluminum.

    Fourth, since the capacity of small and medium-sized hydropower stations is generally good, the generator voltage can usually meet the requirements of electrolytic aluminum plants. Building small aluminum plants near hydropower stations eliminates the need for transformers and allows direct power supply to the aluminum plant. If DC generators can be installed in the hydropower station to directly supply DC power to the electrolytic aluminum plant, the last two "foreign" pieces of equipment in the small aluminum plant—transformers and rectifying equipment—can be completely eliminated. This not only saves equipment but also reduces the investment in the electrolytic aluminum plant by another one-third.

    Fifth, it can reduce the cost of aluminum. The characteristic of indigenous aluminum production is high power consumption, generally consuming one-tenth more electricity than "foreign" methods, requiring over 20,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per ton of aluminum. Because the price of electricity has a significant impact on the cost of aluminum. Generally, electricity costs account for about 25% to 60% of the cost of aluminum. Currently, the price of electricity in major power supply areas in China is mostly five to ten cents per kilowatt-hour. Small and medium-sized hydropower stations have low investment, low operating costs, and very low costs. If the electricity price is reduced to one to two cents per kilowatt-hour, the cost of aluminum can be reduced by one-half to one-third.

    Sixth, the investment can be recovered within one year. If the electrolysis cost of small and medium-sized hydropower stations is one cent per kilowatt-hour, the estimated cost of aluminum is 1,500 yuan. The current allocation price of aluminum ingots is about 3,000 yuan. An aluminum plant with an annual output of 1,000 tons can obtain a net profit of 1.5 million yuan within one year. This amount is sufficient to build an aluminum plant with an annual output of 1,000 tons and a hydropower station with a capacity of 2,400 kilowatts.

    Therefore, we suggest:

    I. Please the State Technological Commission to study the combination of small aluminum plants and small and medium-sized hydropower stations as a current technical policy.

    II. Please the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to select appropriate regions for pilot projects. It is best to choose regions where some small and medium-sized hydropower stations have already been built and where there are local aluminum ore resources, such as Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces, to gain experience.

    III. Please the water conservancy and electric power departments and metallurgical industry departments of each province to jointly study and combine the construction of small aluminum plants and small and medium-sized hydropower stations with the current winter and spring water conservancy upsurge, making unified arrangements to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

    IV. We hope that the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and various provinces will strengthen the manufacturing capabilities of mechanical and electrical equipment for small and medium-sized hydropower stations to meet the needs of small and medium-sized hydropower construction. In order to save transformers and rectifying equipment for aluminum plants, it is best to seize the opportunity to manufacture some DC generators suitable for small and medium-sized hydropower stations.

    V. If this method works, please the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to consider appropriately increasing the number of small aluminum plants to replace some large and medium-sized aluminum plants.

    The above are some immature views, please related departments study and correct them.

### 把小铝厂和中小水电站结合起来

    把小铝厂和中小水电站结合起来
    水利水电建设总局规划处
    目前炼铝的唯一办法是电解法，要炼铝必须用电。炼一吨铝需要二点七瓩电力，二万度电能；而当前电力供应又十分紧张。如何为我们的铝厂寻找充分而廉价的电源呢？我们建议：把冶金部正在推广的小型土法铝厂和农村中正在普遍兴建的中小型水电站结合起来。这样，就可以使制铝工业有可靠的电源，得以迅速的发展。在电力工业来说，充分利用中小型水电站来解决制铝工业的用电问题，可以相当地减轻对大电网、大基地供电的压力，也是一种“兵对兵、将对将”的做法。
    去冬今春，全国共完成中型水利工程三千余处。如果加以充分利用，可以发电一百万瓩。但是现在只利用了十万瓩。水利电力部已经提出，要求各地凡是能发电的水利工程都要使它发电。今冬明春的水利建设规模更大，如果将其中一部分电力用来供应小型铝厂，对各方面都是有利的。
    把小型铝厂和中小型水电站结合起来，除了前面提到的可以保证制铝工业的电力供应和减轻大电网、大基地的供电紧张情况外，还具有一系列的优点。
    第一、中小型水电站的建设速度快，可以赶得上小型铝厂的建设速度，和小型铝厂易于配合好。如果在已建成的中小型水库上加装发电设备，需要的时间就更短。
    第二、制造中小型水电设备不需要大机器，也不要进口的贵重材料，工艺上也比较简单，各省一般可以自己解决。
    第三、把小型铝厂建设在水电站附近，可以节省输电线路和输电费用，从而可以节省大量的铜和铝。
    第四、由于中小型水电站的容量一般都比较好，发电机电压大都可以适应电解铝厂的要求，小型铝厂建设在水电站附近，就不要经过变压直接供铝厂使用。如果能在水电站内安装直流发电机，直接供给电解铝厂直流电源，就可以把小型铝厂最后两种“洋”设备——变压器和整流设备全部省去。这样，不仅节省了设备，同时可以使电解铝厂的投资再降低三分之一。
    第五、可以降低铝的成本。土法制铝的特点是耗电量大，一般比“洋”法要多消耗十分之一，每吨铝要消耗二万多度电能。因为电价高低对铝的成本影响很大。一般铝的成本中，电费约占25％到60％左右。我国目前主要供电地方电价大都为每度五分到一角。中小型水电站由于投资低，运行费用小，成本很低。如果每度电价降低到一到二分，铝的成本就可以降低二分之一到三分之一。
    第六、投资在一年内可以收回。如果中小型水电站的电解成本为每度一分，铝的成本估计为一千五百元，目前铝锭调拨价格约为三千元，一个年产一千吨的铝厂，一年内就可以获得一百五十万元纯收益。这笔费用足够建设一座年产一千吨铝厂和一座二千四百瓩的水电站之用。
    因此，我们建议：
    一、请国家技术委员会将小型铝厂和中小型水电站的结合问题作为当前的一项技术政策来进行研究。
    二、请水利电力部和冶金工业部选择适当的地区，进行试点。最好选择在已经建成一部分中小型水电站，当地又有铝矿资源的地区，如山东、河南、浙江、福建、贵州、四川、云南等省，以取得经验。
    三、请各省水利电力部门和冶金工业部门一起研究，结合今冬明春的水利高潮，将小型铝厂和中小型水电站的建设作统一的安排，一气呵成，事半功倍。
    四、希望第一机械工业部和各省加强中小型水电站机电设备的制造力量，满足中小型水电建设的需要。为了节省铝厂的变压器和整流设备，最好能抓紧制造一部分适用于中小型水电站的直流发电机。
    五、如果这个方法行得通，请国家计划委员会和冶金工业部考虑，适当增加小型铝厂的数目，以代替一些大中型铝厂。
    以上是一些不成熟的看法，请有关部门研究指正。
