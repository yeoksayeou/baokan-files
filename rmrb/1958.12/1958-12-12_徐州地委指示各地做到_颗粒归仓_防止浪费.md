    According to Xinhua Daily, the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of Jiangsu recently instructed all regions, in the final sprint of the autumn harvest, to ensure the following in each county: 1. Swiftly and thoroughly harvest all remaining crops, mainly sweet potatoes, cotton, peanuts, as well as reeds, castor beans, sunflowers, etc. 2. In areas that have already been harvested, organize teams to conduct inspections. Areas that were not harvested cleanly must be revisited, and another small-scale autumn harvest should be carried out, ensuring that not a single grain is left behind and every blade of grass is brought home. 3. Crops that have already been harvested must be processed promptly and properly, immediately stored in granaries, and resolutely prevent any damage, mildew, or waste. In particular, efforts must be concentrated on seizing the current good weather and unfrozen conditions to massively and rapidly slice and dry sweet potatoes. 4. Collect large quantities of sweet potato vines, cotton stalks, radish leaves, etc. from the fields and threshing grounds, store them carefully, and make full use of them as feed and fuel.
