Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The National Salt Production Conference of the Ministry of Light Industry, which concluded in Beijing on the 25th, proposed that next year, the principle of vigorously developing crude salt production and comprehensively utilizing salt resources under the premise of focusing on salt should be implemented.

This year, China's salt production has achieved a bumper harvest. However, the increase in production is still far from meeting the needs of society. Next year, with the continued overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the demand for salt from the alkali-making industry, agriculture, fisheries, and animal husbandry will increase significantly compared to this year. At present, the layout of crude salt production in China is also unreasonable and should be gradually resolved in the long term. In light of these circumstances, the conference emphasized that it is essential to resolutely implement the principle of combining large, medium, and small-scale operations, with a focus on medium and small-scale, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, with a focus on indigenous methods. We must rely on our own efforts, overcome difficulties, and strive for high-speed development in salt production next year. Next year, we must not only expand production in existing major producing areas but also actively develop production in salt-deficient areas. All regions with the need and conditions for development should actively develop, so that sea salt, lake salt, well salt, mineral salt, soil salt, and nitrate salt can blossom everywhere and develop in an all-round way.

Regarding the comprehensive utilization of salt resources, the conference proposed that next year, we should continue to engage in large-scale chemical production under the premise of focusing on salt, improve the utilization rate of bittern, actively trial-produce new products, further increase new varieties, expand the scale of chemical production, increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs.

In order to ensure the completion of next year's salt production tasks, the conference studied specific measures, mainly: relying on the leadership of the Party and launching a mass movement; relying on Party committees, local authorities, and people's communes to run salt fields on a large scale; emancipating the mind and vigorously carrying out technological revolution; and seizing the time this winter and next spring to prepare for increased production next year, striving for the salt fields that started construction this year to be partially or fully put into production next year.

The representatives unanimously believed that the development of rural people's communes has created favorable conditions for doing a good job and developing salt production because many communes have the conditions to run salt fields on a large scale as a way for communes to engage in industry and increase income and can sell salt locally to meet local needs.

The conference summarized the advanced experience of technological innovations in salt production in various regions over the years and formulated an outline for the salt industry's technological revolution.

    扩建新建盐场  综合利用盐源
    轻工业部全国盐业生产会议提出明年方针
    据新华社讯  25日在北京闭幕的轻工业部全国盐业生产会议，提出了明年要贯彻大力发展原盐生产，并在以盐为主的前提下，综合利用盐业资源的方针。
    今年我国盐业生产获得了丰收。但是生产的增长还远不能满足社会的需要。明年随着工农业生产的继续全面跃进，制碱工业、农业、渔业、畜牧业对盐的需要量都将比今年增加很多。目前我国原盐生产的布局也不合理，从长远来看，应该逐步加以解决。根据这些情况，会议强调必须坚决贯彻大中小结合、以中小为主，土洋结合、以土为主的方针，自力更生，克服困难，力争明年盐业生产高速度发展。明年既要扩大现有主要产区的生产，又要积极发展缺盐地区的生产，凡是有需要有条件发展的地区都要积极发展，使海、湖、井、矿、土及硝盐，遍地开花，全面发展。
    关于盐业资源的综合利用，会议提出明年要继续在以盐为主的前提下大搞化工生产，提高苦卤利用率，积极试制新产品，进一步增加新的品种，扩大化工生产规模，提高产量，改进质量，降低成本。
    为了保证明年盐业生产任务的完成，会议研究了具体措施，主要是：依靠党的领导，大搞群众运动；依靠党委、依靠地方、依靠人民公社大办盐场；解放思想，大闹技术革命；抓紧在今冬明春做好明年增产的准备工作，力争今年上马的盐场明年就能部分或全部投入生产。
    代表们一致认为，农村人民公社的发展，为搞好与发展盐业生产创造了有利条件，因为许多公社有条件大办盐场，作为公社大搞工业、增加收入的一个门路，并且可以就地销售，满足本地需要。
    会议总结了历年来各地盐业生产技术革新的先进经验，制订了盐业技术革命纲要。
