Ignoring Fire Safety Has Terrible Consequences
Beijing Repair Factory Suffers Major Fire, Losses Reach 700,000 Yuan

(Beijing Daily News) The Beijing Repair Factory of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, due to neglecting fire safety work and seriously violating safety technical operating procedures, recently suffered the largest fire since the liberation of Beijing, causing a loss of approximately 700,000 yuan in state property.

The fifth workshop of this factory, the transformer section, has four drying rooms equipped with underground electric furnaces for drying products and equipment. Safety technical regulations stipulate: "No drying objects are allowed to be placed on the iron plates of the furnace wires in the drying room to prevent damage." However, a group leader in this section, when baking motor coils in the No. 2 drying room, used wooden stools to support the motor coils, placing the stool legs on the iron grate of the underground electric furnace heating wires, and closely packing bricks around the stool legs, which caused the heat to concentrate even more on the stool legs. On the morning of the 6th of this month, a new apprentice, Li Zhenhong, was on duty to close the electrical switch. Before going on duty, the group leader did not explain the precautions to him. While on duty, Li Zhenhong was only concerned with writing poetry and prolonged the switch-on time. Due to the sudden increase in heat, the stool legs caught fire. When this happened, the drying room should have been sealed to prevent the fire from spreading, but Li Zhenhong did not have this fire-fighting knowledge and hurriedly opened the door of the drying room. The fire then spread into the factory building, causing the entire workshop building and all products in the building, such as generators and transformers, to be burned to ashes.

The major fire at the Beijing Repair Factory is significantly related to the factory's neglect of safety. The factory usually did not carry out fire safety work well and did not implement the State Council's instructions on strengthening fire prevention work. The factory did not establish a level-by-level responsibility system for fire prevention work; nor did it incorporate fire prevention work into the factory's production management plan; neither the entire factory nor the workshops and sections had established fire safety regulations; the Party organization and administrative leadership also did not mobilize the masses to expose fire hazards and jointly carry out fire prevention work. Although there were "Safety Technical Regulations," they did not promote and implement them well among the workers. The implementation of the safety technical regulations was merely a formality and practically equivalent to having no regulations at all. The factory usually did not do enough safety education for the workers. In March of last year, the factory had an incident where wood placed on the iron grate of the electric furnace was burned; since the beginning of this year, there have been twelve fire accidents, but none of them aroused the factory's vigilance.

All the workers of the Beijing Repair Factory have learned a lesson from this incident. While actively resuming production, under the leadership of the Party committee, they launched a safety movement week. They adopted the form of a big鸣大放 (letting off steam freely) to expose loopholes and unsafe problems related to production management, operating procedures, fire prevention work, safety protection, public security work, and safety regulations by posting more than 3,600 big-character posters. Many people also conducted self-criticism on the big-character posters and proposed safety guarantees.

    忽视防火安全后果可怕
    北京修造厂遭到大火灾损失达七十万元
    据北京日报消息  水利电力部北京修造厂，由于忽视防火安全工作，并严重地违反了安全技术操作规程，最近遭到了北京解放以来最大的一次火灾，使国家财产损失达七十万元左右。
    这个厂的第五车间变压器工段有四个干燥室，装有地下电炉，用来烘干产品和器材。安全技术规程中规定：“干燥室内不准将干燥物件放在炉丝的铁板上，以防烧损。”但是，这个工段的一位组长在第二号干燥室烘烤电机线圈的时候，却用木板凳垫电机线圈，而把板凳腿放在地下电炉热力丝的铁篦子上，板凳腿的四周又紧密地铺上了砖，这样就使热力更集中在板凳腿上。到了本月6日早晨，却遇新学徒李振宏在合电闸值班，值班前，组长没有向他交代注意事项。值班中李振宏自己只顾写诗，延长了开闸时间，由于热力骤然加高，板凳腿就燃烧了起来。遇到这种情况，本来应该把干燥室密闭，来防止火势蔓延，但是李振宏并没有这种消防知识，竟慌忙打开了干燥室的门，火随即扑进了厂房，使整个工段的厂房和厂房中的发电机、变压器等全部产品付之一炬。
    北京修造厂发生这次大火，跟这个厂忽视安全有重大关系。这个厂平时没有很好地开展消防安全工作，对于国务院关于加强消防工作的指示，没有贯彻执行。全厂没有建立防火工作的逐级负责制；也没有把消防工作纳入厂的生产管理计划之内；全厂和各车间、工段，都没有制定防火安全制度；党组织和行政领导也没有发动群众揭露火险，共同做好防火工作。虽然有了“安全技术规程”，但是他们没有很好地向职工宣传贯彻，安全技术规程的执行流于形式，实际上等于没有什么规程。平时这个厂对于职工的安全教育也做得很不够。去年3月，这个厂曾经发生过一起木头放在电炉铁篦子上被烤着的事；今年以来，又先后发生了十二次起火事故，但是都没有引起这个厂的警惕。
    北京修造厂全体职工，已从这次事件中吸取了教训。他们与积极恢复生产的同时，在党委的领导下，开展了安全运动周的活动。他们采取大鸣大放的形式，就有关生产管理、操作规程、消防工作、安全防护、治保工作、安全制度等方面存在的问题，贴出了三千六百多张大字报，揭发漏洞，揭发不安全的问题。许多人还在大字报上进行了自我检查，提出了安全保证。
