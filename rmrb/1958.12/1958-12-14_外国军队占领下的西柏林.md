    West Berlin Under Foreign Military Occupation
    By Our Correspondent  Liu Guiliang
    Taking the elevated train from Friedrichstrasse in the Berlin Democratic sector, it only takes two or three minutes to cross the Spree River, and you arrive in a completely different world – West Berlin, occupied by the American, British, and French troops.
    Here, you can no longer see the neat, simple, and magnificent streets and buildings like Stalin Avenue in the Democratic sector on the east bank of the river, nor can you see the vigorous labor of the entire people working diligently to build socialism, or the thriving and healthy atmosphere that permeates everywhere.
    Here, you see noisy and chaotic streets and bizarre modernist buildings, you see American soldiers driving jeeps recklessly on the streets, the kiosks are filled with American crime and gangster novels and pin-up magazines of women’s legs, American cheap and lewd movie posters are everywhere, and the jitterbug is rampant. In bars and restaurants, you can not only see open gambling, but you can also often hear Nazi-era songs and see Nazi-era Iron Cross emblems. Newcomers will find themselves trapped in historical relics that have regressed thirteen or fourteen years. In short, the American way of life plus the resurrected Nazi ghost is the scene people encounter immediately upon arriving in West Berlin.
    Along the twenty-six-kilometer border from north to south, you can see this clear and sharp contrast everywhere. Just across a river, across a street, it’s like two different worlds.
    Looking at the map, you can see that in the red ocean of the German Democratic Republic, which is located at the westernmost end of the socialist camp and covers an area of 107,862 square kilometers, West Berlin remains a solitary white island. Its area is 481 square kilometers, accounting for more than half of the entire city of Greater Berlin (884 square kilometers), and its population is 2.2 million, accounting for two-thirds of Greater Berlin’s population (3.3 million). Its location is precisely at the center of the German Democratic Republic and the entire European continent.
    Everyone knows that this white island, along with the red ocean that surrounds it, was liberated from the iron heel of Hitler's fascism by the great Soviet army more than thirteen years ago, but its experience over the past thirteen years has been very different.
    While militarism, Nazism, and monopoly capital have long been eradicated in the Berlin Democratic sector and the entire German Democratic Republic, and they have embarked on the broad road of socialist construction, West Berlin, a white island that should belong to the capital of the German Democratic Republic, has not only never seriously implemented the basic principles and various provisions of the Potsdam Agreement under the occupation of the United States, Britain, and France, but has increasingly become the center of the Western countries’ Cold War, a base for subversive activities, a reactionary fortress for creating new war crises and harboring dirt and filth.
    The German people deeply understand the weight of the Soviet Union's statement in its note on the Berlin issue: "Such a situation is intolerable and should be changed."
    West Berlin has been under the occupation of the United States, Britain, and France for more than thirteen years, a period longer than Hitler's rule over Berlin by one year.
    During these long years, the United States, Britain, and France have only enjoyed the right to occupy West Berlin and have not fulfilled the solemn obligations stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and other relevant four-power agreements. On the contrary, they have undermined these agreements.
    The basic principle of the Potsdam Agreement is to eradicate the roots of militarism and Nazism in Germany, which are the scourges of peace in Europe and the world, and to help the healthy forces of the German nation establish a peaceful and democratic Germany.
    So, what is the current situation in West Berlin under the occupation of the United States, Britain, and France?
    It has long been turned back into a paradise for militarists and Nazis.
    With the vigorous support of the United States and the West German government, the old militarists have re-established as many as 111 militaristic organizations from the Hitler era, including the notorious "Steel Helmet," "Mutual Aid Association of Former SS Members," "German Soldiers' Association," "Former Paratrooper Soldiers' League," "Bear Division Soldiers' League," "Association for the Movement of People Who Support the Emperor and the Empire," and so on. The head of the "Mutual Aid Association of Former SS Members," Kernmeyer, openly and shamelessly said: "Today, the goals of the SS members are the same as the goals in the Hitler era." These militarists openly clamor for regaining power at their gatherings.
    In fact, they have indeed regained power. 32% of the staff in the West Berlin police bureau are Nazis, mainly former SS officers.
    Nazi fascists are even more prevalent in the West Berlin municipal government agencies. As of September this year, 24,000 Nazis have been absorbed into the municipal agencies. According to statistics, Nazis account for 45% of the total staff in the West Berlin Finance Bureau, 27% in the Labor Bureau and Transportation Bureau, and 25% in the Economic Bureau.
    In the West Berlin District Court, thirty-three Nazi judges with blood on their hands hold important positions. Neumann, an advisor to the Supreme Military Court during the Nazi era, is now the President of the West Berlin Higher Social Court. Fascist verdicts from the Third Reich era are still considered "valid law" in West Berlin today and serve as the "basis" for current judgments. In a 1956 ruling, the West Berlin District Court even stated that the Hitler regime's "establishment of concentration camps was a legitimate measure to defend the country."
    The West Berlin municipal government pays 3.55 million marks in preferential treatment to high-ranking retirees from the Hitler regime every year. Those who receive this preferential treatment include former senior military officers, war criminals, and the wives of leading Nazis.
    It is no longer a secret that the heirs of bandits such as Hitler, Goering, and Goebbels can also regain their deposits in West Berlin. According to statistics from the German Committee for Unity, this secret deposit of Nazi leaders amounts to at least 19.4 million old marks, plus 510,000 West German marks. In addition, there is real estate worth 2 million West German marks.
    West Berlin's revanchist hysteria is now openly supported by the foreign occupying authorities and the West Berlin municipal government. The "Oriental Studies" filled with revanchist ideas is one of the compulsory courses in universities. In modern history textbooks for primary and secondary schools, Hitler is portrayed as a figure who "bravely resisted the red tide." Hitler's "Mein Kampf" has been designated as "reference reading" by the education authorities.
    The American occupiers, in collusion with the British, French, and West German governments, are so recklessly cultivating fascist germs because they have consistently regarded West Berlin as a base for intensifying the Cold War, creating tension, and threatening and subverting the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries.
    In order to carry out subversive activities, Western countries have established eighty-three various spy and special agent organizations in this "frontline city" of what they call the North Atlantic Group deep into the socialist camp, a large part of which are American special agent organizations, including the notorious "Military Intelligence Service," "Central Intelligence Agency," "Special Investigation Bureau," and "Counterintelligence Corps," etc. The West German special agent organizations funded by the United States include the "Combat Group Against Inhumanity," "Gehlen Intelligence Organization," "Association of Free Jurists," "Association of Eastern Political Refugees," "East-West Relief Society," and "Cultural Relief Association." In addition, the British and French occupiers also have their own intelligence special agent organizations, and the West German political parties also have so-called "Eastern Bureaus" in West Berlin, specializing in subversive activities against the German Democratic Republic. These various special agent organizations have done all kinds of bad things. They send special agents to the German Democratic Republic to collect political, military, and economic intelligence, sabotage industrial and mining enterprises and transportation, conspire to organize strikes, coerce and lure technicians to flee, release balloons, distribute provocative propaganda, and threaten the German Democratic Republic's aviation safety. In addition, they also conspire to organize armed riots, arson, assassination, poisoning, explosions, and other criminal activities.
    Anyone who has been to Berlin knows that the street west of the Brandenburg Gate and connected to Unter den Linden in the Berlin Democratic sector was originally named Charlottenburg Avenue. Now, the West Berlin authorities have shamelessly renamed it "June 17th Street" in order to make people never forget the heinous crimes of the "June 17th" riot that Western countries created here in the summer of 1953. Yes, all honest Berliners will never forget this humiliation imposed on them by the American occupiers.
    American and West German special agent organizations also created another subversive conspiracy here. At the end of October 1956, when the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riot was raging, American and West German special agent organizations immediately stirred at the behest of their masters. On the one hand, they hired a large number of thugs and beaters in West Berlin and attempted to storm through the Brandenburg Gate to launch an armed riot on the evening of November 5th; on the other hand, they instructed the special agents they sent to the veterinary college of Humboldt University in the Democratic sector to use rumors and instigation to incite university teachers and students to hold an anti-Soviet demonstration on Unter den Linden at the same time as an internal response to the armed bandits in West Berlin. The enemy's wishful thinking was to use such a poisonous plan of internal and external cooperation to re-launch a "June 17th" incident. The American occupying forces in West Berlin were on standby to carry out "police action" in the Berlin Democratic sector. Of course, the enemy's poisonous plan failed completely under the strong resistance of the people of the German Democratic Republic. The West Berlin thugs were blocked by the iron arms of the people's police outside the Brandenburg Gate, and the special agents of the American "Counterintelligence Corps" lurking in the veterinary college of Humboldt University not only failed to incite an anti-Soviet demonstration, but were also exposed by the teachers and students of the entire school. The American occupying forces in West Berlin did not get a pretext for provocation. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of situation this poisonous plan of the enemy would cause in Berlin and even the entire Europe if it succeeded.
    The crimes of Western countries using West Berlin to carry out subversion and sabotage activities against the German Democratic Republic are too numerous to mention. Over the years, the public security organs of the German Democratic Republic have continuously uncovered a large number of such cases. In February 1955, American special agent Arno Bader set fire to the broadcast hall of the National Broadcasting Committee of the German Democratic Republic. According to a captured special agent, Schoeber, he confessed that he had been ordered by the "Combat Group Against Inhumanity" under the instructions of American special agents to use his veterinary status to poison the meat supplied to the residents of the German Democratic Republic with American lethal poison. If this conspiracy had succeeded, it could have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of residents, thus serving as an excuse for further provocation and incitement.
    The underground telephone tapping station discovered in the Berlin Democratic sector in April 1956, which was dug from the American-occupied zone, once again ruthlessly exposed the towering crimes of the American occupiers infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries. At that time, no fewer than 40,000 residents of East and West Berlin and journalists from various countries had personally visited the complete set of "American-made" equipment in the tunnel. Last December, special agents from Western countries again attempted to sneak into the Marxist-Leninist Institute of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the Democratic sector from the British-occupied zone using the tunnel from the old parliament to the old presidential palace. As a result, they failed.
    Last September, the Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic tried the special agent Schroberk and Weier, the section chiefs of the No. 8 general command of the American special agent organization "Counterintelligence Corps," and other special agent elements. According to the confession of these two special agents, they were the unit leaders of the American "Counterintelligence Corps" and were responsible for training special agent groups sent to the Berlin Democratic sector and the Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, and Saxony regions. After these trained special agent elements sneaked into the German Democratic Republic, they carried out extensive reconnaissance of military and economic targets, and established ammunition depots, radio bases, and counter-revolutionary groups.
    Just citing the above few examples is enough to illustrate how Western countries, especially the United States and West Germany, are painstakingly using West Berlin to create evil.
    As soon as the Soviet Union proposed normalizing the Berlin situation, Dulles immediately shouted that "the United States will never give up its privileges in (West) Berlin." What is the reason for this? General Taylor, the U.S. Army Commander, had already explained it for him. When this loser on the Korean battlefield came to Berlin to carry out activities in August this year, he asked the West Berlin municipal government to make every effort to strengthen provocative activities against the German Democratic Republic and intensify the creation of a "murderous atmosphere" in order to create conditions for the United States to further implement Cold War conspiracies in Berlin. Taylor told the Deputy Mayor of West Berlin, Amrehn, at that time, "You might as well shout louder, you should act as if we have decided to take military action in Berlin... As a soldier, I must tell you that Berlin is just a mousetrap for us, that is to say, it has no serious military value. But as a politician, I know that Berlin is a good trump card in our psychological warfare." However, although the trump card is "good," the actions of Western countries over the past thirteen years have already made them lose any legal or moral basis for continuing to possess this trump card. Moreover, the "good trump card" in the eyes of imperialists is precisely a malignant tumor with endless harm to the people. If it is a malignant tumor, it must be removed! (Attached picture)

    外国军队占领下的西柏林
    本报记者  刘桂梁
    从柏林民主区的腓特烈大街乘上高架电车，只需两三分钟的光景列车跨过史普里河，你就到了完全不同的另外一个世界——美、英、法三国军队占领下的柏林西区。
    这里，你再也看不到河东岸民主区里像斯大林大街那样整洁、朴素而雄伟的街道和建筑，更看不到那种全体人民为建设社会主义而朝气蓬勃地辛勤劳动和到处洋溢着欣欣向荣的健康气息的景象。
    这里，你看到的是喧闹嘈杂的街道和奇形怪状的现代派建筑，你看到的是美国兵开着吉普车在大街上横冲直撞，大小书报亭子间充斥着美国犯罪强盗小说和女人大腿的画报，到处张贴着美国黄色、下流电影的广告，阿飞舞到处盛行，在酒吧间和饭馆里你不但可以看到公开的赌博，而且你还时常可以听到纳粹时代的歌曲，看到纳粹时代的铁十字徽章。初到的人会发现自己已陷身于倒退十三、四年的历史陈迹中。简言之，美国生活方式加上复活了的纳粹幽灵，这就是人们一到西柏林立刻就会碰到的景象。
    沿着从北到南二十六公里的边界，你到处可以看到这种鲜明而强烈的对照。仅仅一河、一街之隔，俨然两个世界。
    打开地图，就可以看到在位于社会主义阵营最西端的民主德国方圆十万零七千八百六十二平方公里的红色海洋里，孤零零地残存着西柏林这样一个白色的孤岛。它的面积是四百八十一平方公里，占整个大柏林市（八百八十四平方公里）的一半以上，人口是二百二十万，占大柏林市（共三百三十万人口）的三分之二。而它的位置则恰恰处于民主德国和整个欧洲大陆的中心。
    谁都知道这个白色的孤岛是和包围着它的红色海洋一起，在十三年多以前它是被伟大的苏军从希特勒法西斯铁蹄下解放出来的，但是它十三年多以来的经历却大不相同。
    在柏林民主区和整个民主德国早已根除了军国主义、纳粹主义和垄断资本而走上了社会主义建设的康庄大道的同时，西柏林这个理应属于德意志民主共和国首都一部分的白色孤岛，在美、英、法三国占领下，不但从未认真地执行过波茨坦协定的基本原则和各项规定，而且越来越严重地变成了西方国家进行冷战的中心，颠复活动的基地，制造新战争危机和藏污纳垢的反动堡垒。
    德国人民深深地懂得苏联在关于解决柏林问题的照会中所指出的“这样的局面是不能容忍的，应当加以改变”这句话的份量。
    西柏林处在美、英、法三国占领下已经十三年多了，这个期间比希特勒统治柏林的时期还多了一年。
    在这漫长的岁月中，美、英、法三国只享受了占领柏林西区的权利，而没有履行波茨坦协定和其他有关的四大国协议所规定的庄严义务。相反它们破坏了这些协定。
    波茨坦协定的基本原则是根除欧洲和世界和平的祸根——德国军国主义和纳粹主义，帮助德国民族的健康力量建立一个和平民主的德国。
    那末美、英、法占领下的西柏林的现状是怎样的呢？
    它早已重新变成了军国主义者和纳粹分子的乐园。
    在美国和西德政府的大力资助下旧日的军国主义分子重新恢复了希特勒时代的军国主义团体一百一十一个之多，其中包括臭名远扬的
  “钢盔团”、“前党卫军军人互助协会”、“德国军人协会”、“前伞兵军人联盟”、“熊师军人联盟”、“拥戴皇帝和帝国民众运动协会”等等。“前党卫军军人互助协会”的头子克恩麦耶公开无耻地说：“今天党卫军成员的目标和在希特勒时代的目标是相同的”。这些军国主义分子，并且在集会时公然叫嚣要求重新掌权。
    实际上它们的确已重新掌了权。西柏林警察局内就有32％的工作人员是纳粹分子，其中主要是前党卫军军官。
    纳粹法西斯分子更是充塞在西柏林的市政府机构中，到今年9月止，已有二万四千名纳粹分子被吸收在市政机构工作。据统计，西柏林财政局中的纳粹分子占全体工作人员的45％，在劳动局和交通局各占27％，在经济局占25％。
    在西柏林地方法院里有三十三个全身血迹的纳粹法官担任重要职务，纳粹时代的最高军事法庭顾问诺伊曼现任西柏林高等社会法庭庭长。第三帝国时期的法西斯判决，今天在西柏林仍然被认为是“有效的法律”，并作为现在的判决的“根据”。西柏林地方法院1956年在一项判决中竟说希特勒政权“设置集中营曾经是正当的保卫国家的措施”。
    西柏林市政府每年付给希特勒政权中有地位的退休人员以三百五十五万马克的优抚金，领受这种优抚金的有前高级军官、战争罪犯以及首要纳粹分子的妻子。
    甚至这样的事情也已不再是什么秘密：希特勒、戈林、戈培尔等匪徒的继承人也重新能够领到他们在西柏林的存款。据德国争取统一委员会统计，这笔纳粹头子的秘密存款至少达一千九百四十万旧马克，另五十一万西德马克。此外，还有价值两百万西德马克的地产。
    西柏林复仇主义的歇斯底里，现在已得到外国占领当局和西柏林市政府的公开支持。充满复仇主义思想的“东方学”是高等学校的必修课之一。在中、小学的现代历史教科书里，希特勒被描绘成一个“勇敢地抵抗红色潮流”的人物。希特勒的“我的奋斗”已被教育当局规定为“参考读物”。
    美国占领者伙同英法和西德政府这样肆无忌惮地培养法西斯毒菌，是因为它们多年来始终把西柏林当成了加剧冷战、制造紧张局势、威胁和颠复民主德国、苏联及其他社会主义国家的阴谋活动的基地。
    为了进行颠复活动，西方国家在这个他们所谓的北大西洋集团深入社会主义阵营的“前线城市”，建立了八十三个形形色色的间谍特务机构，其中很大一部分是美国的特务机构，包括臭名昭著的“军事情报处”、“中央情报局”、“特种侦查局”和“反间谍队”等。受美国经费资助的西德特务组织，最大的有“反非人道战斗小组”、“盖伦情报局”、“自由法学者协会”、“东方政治逃亡者联合会”、“东西救济会”、“文化救济联合会”等。此外英法占领者也各有它们的情报特务机构，西德各政党也都在西柏林设有所谓“东方局”，专门从事对民主德国的颠复活动。这些形形色色的特务组织做尽了坏事。它们派遣特务到民主德国搜集政治、军事、经济情报，破坏工矿企业和交通运输，阴谋组织怠工、胁迫和诱惑技术人员逃亡、放气球、散发挑拨性宣传品、威胁民主德国航空安全。此外还阴谋组织武装暴动、纵火、暗杀、放毒、爆炸等罪恶勾当。
    到过柏林的人都知道，在东西柏林分界线的勃兰登堡门以西和柏林民主区的菩提树下街相衔接的大街，原名为莎洛敦堡大街，现在西柏林当局竟恬不知耻地把它改名为“六月十七号大街”，以此来使人们永不忘记1953年夏天西方国家在这里制造的“六·一七”暴乱的滔天罪行。是的，一切正直的柏林人永远也不会忘记美国占领者所强加在他们身上的这个奇耻大辱。
    美国和西德特务组织在这里还制造过另一个颠复阴谋。1956年10月末，当匈牙利反革命暴乱正闹得乌烟瘴气时，美国和西德的特务组织奉它们的主子之命立刻蠢动起来。它们一方面在西柏林雇好了大批暴徒打手，11月5日傍晚企图冲过勃兰登堡门掀起武装暴乱；另一方面又指使它们派到民主区洪堡大学兽医学院潜伏的特务，用造谣挑拨的手法煽动大学师生也在同一时间到菩提树下街举行反苏游行示威，以作为西柏林的武装匪徒们的内应。敌人的如意算盘是以这样一个里应外合的毒计重新搞起一次“六·一七”事件。西柏林的美国占领军当时曾待命出动到柏林民主区执行“警察行动”。当然，敌人的这个阴谋毒计在民主德国人民的坚强反击下根本没有得逞。西柏林的暴徒被人民警察的铁臂阻挡在勃兰登堡门以外，潜藏在洪堡大学兽医学院美国“反间谍队”的特务们，不但没能煽起反苏游行，而且被全校师生识破了他们的丑恶面目。西柏林的美国占领军根本没得到挑衅的借口。不难设想，假如敌人的这个毒计得逞的话，将会在柏林以至整个欧洲引起一个什么样的局面。
    西方国家利用西柏林进行对民主德国的颠复和破坏活动的罪行是罄竹难书的。几年来民主德国公安机关不断地破获了大量的这类案件。1955年2月美国特务阿诺·巴德纵火烧毁了民主德国国家广播委员会的广播大厅。据一个被捕获的特务施埃伯供认，他曾奉美国特务指使下的“反非人道战斗小组”的命令，借兽医的身份对供应民主德国居民的肉类施放美国的烈性毒药。这一阴谋如果得逞，可以造成成千上万居民的死亡，从而做为进一步挑拨煽动的借口。
    1956年4月间柏林民主区发现的从美占区挖通的地道电话偷听站，又一次无情地揭露了美国占领者侵犯别国主权的滔天罪行。当时东、西柏林居民和各国记者不下四万人，曾亲眼参观过地道里“美国制”的全套设备。去年12月，西方国家特务又从英占区利用旧国会通往旧总统府的地道，企图潜入民主区的德国统一社会党中央委员会马列主义研究所。结果未能得逞。
    去年9月，民主德国最高法院审讯了美国特务机关“反间谍队”第八号总指挥站的科长施罗勃克和魏厄等特务分子。据这两个特务供认，他们是美国“反间谍队”的单位负责人，曾负责训练了派到柏林民主区和勃兰登堡、麦克伦堡、萨赫森等地区的特务集团。这些受过训的特务分子们潜入民主德国后，就进行广泛的侦查军事和经济目标的活动，并且建立军火仓库、无线电基地和反革命团体。
    只举出以上这样几个实例，已足以说明西方国家特别是美国和西德，是如何处心积虑地利用西柏林来制造罪恶。
    苏联刚一提出使柏林局势正常化的主张时，杜勒斯立刻大喊大叫“美国绝不放弃它在（西）柏林的特权”，这究竟是为了什么呢？美国陆军司令泰勒早已替他作了说明。这位朝鲜战场上的败将在今年8月间到柏林来活动时，曾要求西柏林市政府竭力加强对民主德国的挑衅活动，加紧制造“杀气腾腾的气氛”，以便给美国在柏林进一步施展冷战阴谋创造条件。泰勒当时对西柏林的副市长阿姆雷恩说，“你们不妨叫喊得更大声一些，你们要做得好像我们已经决定要在柏林采取军事行动似的……我作为军人必须告诉你们，柏林对我们来说只是一个捕鼠的笼子，这就是说，它没有严肃的军事价值。但是作为政治家，我知道柏林是我们的心理战中一张良好的王牌。”然而，王牌虽“好”，西方国家十三年多以来的所作所为，早已使它们自己丧失了继续占有这张王牌的法律上、道义上的任何根据。何况帝国主义者眼中的“良好的王牌”对人民说来却正是一个祸害无穷的毒瘤。是毒瘤就必须割掉！（附图片）
