Motor Torpedo Boat Annihilates Enemy Warship

On the night of September 1st, the torpedo boat unit advanced at high speed against a force five wind, breaking through giant waves. The young captain, Dong Fucai, calmly steered Boat No. 1, searching for the enemy. Suddenly, a small black dot was spotted on the starboard side, which was Chiang Kai-shek's "Yong" class warship; there was also a small black dot directly ahead, which was also a Chiang Kai-shek warship. In an instant, the torpedo boat was only three nautical miles away from the two enemy warships. The two enemy warships preemptively opened fire on the torpedo boat at the same time. Barrages of shells exploded around the torpedo boat. Dong Fucai, who was steering Boat No. 1, and his comrades, braving the artillery fire, charged straight at the enemy warships. The "Jiang" class warship suddenly turned its rudder to starboard, and its firepower shifted to other torpedo boats. Boat No. 1 also quickly turned its rudder to starboard, accelerating to take the "Yong" class warship, which was larger than the "Jiang" class, directly. The firepower of the "Yong" class warship was fierce, concentrating its fire on Boat No. 1. Heroes like Dong Fucai continued to charge towards the "Yong" class enemy warship in the wind and waves, braving the artillery fire, regardless of everything. At this time, the torpedo man Hu Qingxin was already ready for battle. After Boat No. 1 reached the predetermined distance from the enemy warship, Dong Fucai issued the order to fire. With the sound of covering artillery fire, the torpedo had already hit the enemy warship's hull. With a loud bang, thick black smoke mixed with flames shot straight into the sky. The enemy warship was seriously damaged. Our brave Boat No. 1 returned victoriously.

    快艇歼敌舰
    9月1日夜里，鱼雷快艇部队顶着五级大风，冲破巨浪高速度地前进着。年轻的艇长董福才，沉着地驾驶着一号艇，搜索敌情。突然，在右舷发现一个小黑点，这是蒋军的永字号军舰；正前方也有一个小黑点，也是蒋军的舰只。转瞬间快艇距离两只敌舰只有三浬了。两只敌舰先发制人，同时向快艇开了火。一排排的炮弹在快艇周围爆炸，驾驶一号艇的董福才和他的伙伴们，冒着炮火，迎着敌舰，直线冲上去。江字号军舰忽然打了右舵，火力转向别的快艇，一号艇也赶快打右舵，加快速度直取比江字号大的永字号军舰。永字号军舰的火力来势很猛，集中向一号艇发射。董福才等英雄们，不顾一切地继续在风浪中迎着炮火冲向永字号敌舰。这时，鱼雷手胡庆新早已做好了战斗准备。一号艇同敌舰取得了预定的距离后，董福才下达了开火的命令。随着掩护炮火声响，鱼雷已经命中了敌舰舰身，轰隆一声巨响，浓密的黑烟挟着火焰直冲云霄。敌舰受了重伤。我们勇敢的一号艇胜利返航。
