    To Meet the Needs of Popularizing Improved Varieties
    Many Regions are Self-Manufacturing Seed Testing Instruments
    (Our Dispatch) Liaoning, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Shandong and other provinces have achieved great success in the mass movement of self-manufacturing seed testing instruments. They have created various types of samplers, dividers, germination boxes, moisture meters, analytical balances and other complete sets of instruments, breaking through the superstitious idea that these instruments must be manufactured by factories or imported from abroad.
    The movement to create indigenous instruments in Gaiping and Kaiyuan counties, Liaoning Province, has achieved significant results. The Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Gaiping County created an oil lamp germination box (see attached picture), and Kaiyuan County has manufactured and supplied bamboo samplers for stockpiles, bamboo samplers for bags, dividing boards, horizontal germination boxes, wooden germination boxes, and oil-electric dual-purpose seed germination boxes through the Handicraft Industry Federation. De County, Shandong Province, created a peanut sampler, solving the problem of the lack of peanut samplers.
    The masses in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, fully developed their spirit of bold creation and, with the close cooperation of blacksmiths, carpenters, and seed technicians, vigorously carried out a tool revolution. The Heping No. 2 Cooperative in the county is a red banner in the movement to create indigenous instruments. They created 11 kinds of indigenous instruments, including samplers, dividing boards, dividers, grain thermometers, sulfuric acid rapid moisture meters, oil seed germination boxes, and pit temperature seed germination boxes, at a cost of only more than 20 yuan. After appraisal, they fully met scientific requirements.
    After visiting the advanced experience of seed testing in Kaiyuan and Gaiping counties, Liaoning Province, Heilongjiang put forward the slogan "Every commune should establish a seed testing laboratory." Through the bold creation and hard work of the broad masses of commune members, most communes have established seed testing laboratories and equipped them with instruments. The Xingfu Cooperative in Huachuan County created more than ten kinds of instruments, including "oil, electricity, and pit triple-use constant temperature seed germination boxes," electric water meters, one-thousandth balances, one-hundredth balances, and dividing boards, saving expenses. The Xingfu Cooperative has achieved the goal of having a testing laboratory in the commune and a testing group in the team. They have conducted field and indoor testing of all the seeds in the commune and established a regular testing system for incoming and outgoing storage, pre-sowing, and storage management, effectively guaranteeing the quality of the seeds.
    The common characteristics of these provinces in creating indigenous instruments are: using local materials, combining indigenous and foreign methods, spending less money, accomplishing more, and achieving good results. (Attached picture)

    适应推广良种需要
    许多地区自制种子检验仪器
    本报讯  辽宁、山西、黑龙江、山东等省群众大规模地开展自制种子检验仪器运动，取得了巨大成绩。创造了各种各样的扦样器，分样器，发芽箱，水分测定器，分析天秤等整套仪器，突破了一向以为这些仪器必须由工厂制造或者从国外进口的迷信思想。
    辽宁省盖平、开原两县创造土仪器的运动，已取得了重大收获。盖平县爱国农业社创造了油灯发芽箱（见附图），开原县制成的竹制囤用扦样器、竹制袋用扦样器、分样板、卧式发芽箱、木制发芽箱、油电两用种子发芽箱等，已由手工业联合社制造供应。山东德县创造了花生扦样器，解决了缺乏花生扦样器的问题。
    山西省定襄县群众充分发扬了大胆创造精神，在铁匠、木匠和种子技术员等的通力合作下，大闹工具革命。该县和平二社是创造土仪器运动中的一面红旗。他们创造了扦样器、分样板、分样器、粮温计、硫酸快速水分测定器、油用种子发芽箱、坑温种子发芽箱等十一种土仪器，只花了二十多元，经过鉴定，完全合乎科学要求。
    黑龙江在参观了辽宁省开原、盖平两县种子检验的先进经验以后，提出了“社社建立种子检验室”的口号。经过广大社员的大胆创造和刻苦钻研，大部分社已经建立了种子检验室，并且配备了仪器。该省桦川县幸福社创造了“油、电、坑三用恒温种子发芽箱”、电用水分测定器、千分之一天秤、百分之一天秤，分样板等十多种仪器，节省了开支。幸福社已做到了社有检验室，队有检验组，对全社的种子都进行了田间和室内检验，并建立了出入库、播种前和储藏保管期间的定期检验制度，有效地保证了种子的质量。
    这些省创造土仪器的共同特点是：就地取材，土洋结合，花钱少，办事多，效果好。（附图片）
