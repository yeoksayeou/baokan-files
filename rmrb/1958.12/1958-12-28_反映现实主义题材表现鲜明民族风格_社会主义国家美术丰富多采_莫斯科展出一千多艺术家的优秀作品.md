Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th - The rich and diverse First Exhibition of Fine Arts from Socialist Countries solemnly opened today at the Central Exhibition Hall in Moscow.

Hundreds of artists' representatives from participating countries and people from all walks of life in Moscow attended the opening ceremony.

The Chairman of the Presidium of the Exhibition Organizing Committee, Soviet People's Artist Konenkov, said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the basic themes of the works exhibited at this exhibition are the lives and struggles of the working people of various countries for peace, democracy, and socialism. The works fully demonstrate the rich and diverse artistic achievements of artists from various socialist countries, which stands in stark contrast to the abstract art of capitalist countries that serves a minority and is heading towards its demise. Socialist art, which serves the people, has infinitely broad prospects for development.

The Vice-Chairman of the Presidium, Cai Ruohong, a Chinese artist, congratulated the opening of the exhibition on behalf of Chinese art workers. He said that artists from various countries will learn from each other and exchange experiences through the exhibition, so as to promote a new upsurge in realist art creation in socialist countries.

Vice-Chairman of the Presidium Katalik (Czechoslovakia), Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhailov, and Secretary of the Soviet Artists' Union Gerasimov also spoke at the opening ceremony.

This exhibition features approximately three thousand works by over one thousand two hundred artists from socialist countries. The entire exhibition demonstrates the great achievements made by artists from socialist countries under the guidance of realist creation principles.

The exhibition hall is divided into twelve sections according to the twelve participating countries. The "Soviet Section" exhibited over three hundred works and was highly praised by the audience. Here, not only are the works of older generation artists such as Konenkov, Johanson, and Gerasimov displayed, but also masterpieces of young artists, such as Anikushin's "Portrait of Pushkin," Babulin's "Song of the Wasteland," as well as prints and sculptures.

The two hundred and seventy works exhibited by Chinese artists also received unanimous praise from the audience. Liu Kaiqu's relief sculpture "Victory Crossing the Yangtze River" was exhibited in the comprehensive hall at the entrance. Dong Xiwen's "Founding Ceremony" and Wang Shenglie's "Eight Women Throw Themselves into the River" attracted many viewers. Works reflecting China's Great Leap Forward, such as "Overwhelming the Mountains and Seas," and Gu Yuan and Li Hua's woodcuts, as well as Jiang Zhaohe, Chen Banding, and Pan Tianshou's traditional Chinese paintings, also aroused great interest among the audience.

The works of artists from Vietnam, North Korea, and Mongolia have distinct national characteristics. Artists from the German Democratic Republic have created many good works on the basis of printmaking with rich national traditions. Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and other countries have also exhibited many artistic works with distinct characteristics.

This exhibition is not only a major event for artists in the socialist camp, but also a major event for progressive art in the world.

    社会主义国家美术丰富多采
    莫斯科展出一千多艺术家的优秀作品
    新华社莫斯科26日电  丰富多采的第一届社会主义国家造型艺术览展会今天在莫斯科中央览展大厅隆重开幕。
    参加展出的各国艺术家代表和莫斯科各界人士数百人出席了开幕式。
    览展工作委员会主席团主席、苏联人民艺术家科宁科夫在开幕式上致词说，本届览展会展出的作品的基本题材是各国劳动人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争生活。作品充分表现了各个社会主义国家的艺术家的丰富多采的艺术成就，这和那些资本主义国家为少数人服务的抽象派走向末路的艺术成了显明的对照。为人民服务的社会主义艺术，有着它无限广阔的发展前途。
    主席团副主席、中国美术家蔡若虹在开幕式上代表中国美术工作者祝贺展览会开幕。他说，各国艺术家将通过展览会互相学习、交流经验，从而使社会主义各国现实主义的美术创作推向新的高涨。
    主席团副主席卡塔利克（捷）、苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫、苏联美术家协会秘书格拉西莫夫也在开幕式上讲了话。
    这届展览会共展出社会主义国家的一千二百多位艺术家的约三千件作品。整个展览会显示出社会主义各国艺术家在现实主义创作原则的指导下所取得的伟大成就。
    展览厅内按十二个参加国分成十二个部。“苏联部”展出了三百多件作品，极受观众称赞。这里不但陈列着科宁科夫、约甘松、格拉西莫夫等老一辈艺术家的作品，而且还有青年艺术家的杰作，如阿尼库欣的“普希金像”、巴布林的“荒地之歌”以及版画、雕塑等。
    中国艺术家展出的二百七十件作品，也受到了观众的一致好评。刘开渠的浮雕“胜利渡长江”展览在入口的综合厅内，董希文的“开国大典”和王盛烈的“八女投江”吸引了许多观众。反映我国大跃进的作品“排山倒海”和古元、李桦的木刻以及蒋兆和、陈半丁、潘天寿的国画也引起了观众很大的兴趣。
    越南、朝鲜、蒙古等国的艺术家的作品带有鲜明的民族色彩。民主德国的艺术家在富有民族传统的版画的基础上创造出了许多好的作品。匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚等国也展出了许多具有鲜明特点的艺术作品。
    这个展览会不仅是社会主义阵营艺术家的一件大事，并且也是世界进步艺术的一件大事。
