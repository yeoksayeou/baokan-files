Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd dispatch from Moscow via TASS: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Suemitsu Munewaki, on December 2nd and handed him the Soviet government's statement regarding the negotiations between the United States and Japan on revising the so-called "Security Treaty." The full text of the statement is as follows:

The United States and Japan began negotiations in Tokyo on October 4th of this year regarding the revision of the so-called "Security Treaty." This treaty was signed by the United States and Japan in September 1951, and under it, the United States effectively continues to occupy Japan.

The "Security Treaty" was concluded in violation of the will and national interests of the Japanese people. This is evident from the fact that under this treaty, the United States obtained the right from the Japanese government to station U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force units in and near Japan, and to use these forces at its own discretion.

As a result, the United States now has numerous military bases on Japanese territory. These military bases, located thousands of kilometers from the United States and equipped with atomic and rocket weapons, are intended for aggressive purposes because they have nothing to do with the security of the United States. Experience has shown that Japanese territory was used as a springboard for U.S. armed forces during their aggression against Korea. During the U.S. aggression against the People's Republic of China, U.S. armed forces were transferred from Japanese territory to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area.

All of this shows that the U.S. military bases on Japanese territory are threatening the peace-loving people of Asian countries and are directly targeting Japan's neighbors in the Far East, including the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

It is well known that the Japanese people have been waging a resolute struggle since the signing of the aforementioned treaty. This struggle is not only for the removal of U.S. military bases on Japanese territory, but also for the abolition of the treaty itself. This is because the treaty insults the national sentiment of the Japanese people and violates their will, subjecting them to the threat of atomic war.

The Soviet people, as well as all peace-loving people, understand and support the Japanese people's desire to break free from foreign occupation and ensure that Japan develops along a path of peace and friendly cooperation with other countries, especially its neighbors.

The development of good relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries, including the United States, would help establish the necessary trust between countries in the Far East, which is currently lacking. The Soviet people cannot but feel concerned about the increasingly military-aggressive nature of the relationship between Japan and the United States, which is under the leadership of the United States.

According to reports from Japan and the United States, the U.S. government is seeking to conclude a treaty with Japan that would grant the United States the right to continue stationing armed forces in Japan and to use Japanese armed forces against other countries outside of Japanese territory. Because this would be a blatant violation of the Japanese constitution, they have repeatedly attempted to revise the constitution, especially Article 9, which stipulates that Japan forever renounces war and the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes. All of this proves that those American figures responsible for current U.S. foreign policy, and their supporters in Japan, are dragging Japan down a dangerous path of imperialism and revanchism.

The U.S. and Japan are engaged in negotiations on the conclusion of a military treaty while hypocritically promoting "equal rights and equal obligations for both parties," but this does not change the nature of the matter. The purpose of this propaganda is to use fabricated "equal rights and equal obligations" to conceal the aforementioned dangerous plans and the servile nature of the obligations being forced upon the Japanese nation. These obligations stipulate the retention of U.S. military bases on Japanese territory and the use of Japanese armed forces to implement aggressive plans that violate the national interests of the Japanese people.

Some in Japan have attempted to justify the existence of U.S. military bases on Japanese territory by arguing that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950, threatens Japan. The Soviet government considers it necessary to remind that the measures stipulated in this treaty are purely defensive measures to be taken by the Soviet Union and China in the event of aggression against either of them, and are in no way directed against Japan or any other country. If Japan pursues a friendly and peaceful policy towards the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, it will have no reason to be apprehensive about the existence of the Sino-Soviet treaty. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China firmly pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence with all countries and have no intention of aggression against any country, including Japan.

The Soviet government has consistently strived to safeguard peace and develop good neighborly relations with Japan, and has repeatedly reminded the Japanese government that the presence of foreign military bases on Japanese territory, the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan, and the provision of Japanese territory to the United States for use in aggressive activities against the Far East all pose the danger of Japan being dragged into war adventures, the consequences of which would be extremely dire for the Japanese people.

In response to the Soviet government's documents, the Japanese government stated that it has not equipped the Japanese armed forces with nuclear weapons, has not approved the import of nuclear weapons from the United States to Japan, and that Japan's foreign policy is based on the desire to maintain peace and strengthen friendly relations with all peoples. Unfortunately, the Japanese government's policies contradict these statements, as evidenced by the fact that the United States and Japan are now conducting negotiations aimed at making the U.S.-Japan military alliance even more aggressive.

The plan to conclude a U.S.-Japan military treaty, as everyone knows, did not begin today or yesterday; if a U.S.-Japan military treaty were concluded, it would not only mean maintaining U.S. military bases on Japanese territory, but would also directly drag Japan into military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which serves as an instrument for implementing imperialist policies and suppressing the liberation movements of the peoples of the East. Joining this bloc would, in effect, mean joining the entire system of aggressive blocs established under the protection of the United States.

The Japanese government's undertaking of obligations to send troops abroad to participate in the implementation of the plans of the leaders of the aforementioned blocs is a serious violation of the interests of peace in the Far East, and to no small extent, also a serious violation of the interests of Japanese security. In this situation, Japanese armed forces are being used to perform the duties of a gendarme, primarily against the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asian countries. In this regard, it is not superfluous to recall the past: Japan's past imperialist aggression against many Asian countries only aroused hatred towards Japan among the peoples of these countries, and the Japanese people had to pay dearly for the adventurous policies of Japanese imperialists.

But, are the Japanese people, who have experienced such painful lessons, still willing to do so now?

Taking this path can only bring new disasters to the Japanese people, disasters that will be far more severe and tragic than those they have experienced in the past.

The planners of the new military treaty are attempting to prevent Japan from establishing and developing good-neighborly relations with its close neighbors—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—and are dragging Japan into preparations for war, so that the Japanese people will become cannon fodder for new adventures.

It is not difficult to see that the signing of a new U.S.-Japan military treaty will only further complicate the situation in the Far East and further increase the danger of military conflict in this region. This should be especially emphasized because in our era there are all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, such as atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons. The use of these weapons poses a great danger to any country, but is particularly devastating for countries with dense populations and material and other resources concentrated in a small territory.

The Soviet government is not drawing the Japanese government's attention to this issue because it intends to sensationalize or intimidate anyone. It considers it necessary to state this in order to emphasize once again how great the danger is in taking any steps in international politics that exacerbate the threat of atomic war. Any government that truly cherishes the happiness of its own people and is truly concerned about the fate of peace should strive to prevent such a war.

The Soviet government believes that it would be in the interests of strengthening universal peace, the interests of the Japanese nation, and the interests of other peoples if Japan were to abandon the servile military obligations imposed on it in the past, abolish foreign military bases on its territory (including Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands), and withdraw all foreign troops from its territory.

The most reliable guarantee of Japan's security is to steadfastly adhere to the principles of Japan's own constitution, which stipulates Japan's renunciation of the revival of militarism and war, and the principle of providing the possibility for Japan to maintain neutrality. It is precisely this path—the path of neutrality and Japan's pursuit of an independent and peaceful policy—that will make Japan a truly independent country and guarantee its true security.

The Soviet government believes that Japan's pursuit of a policy of neutrality would be a major and constructive contribution to the cause of peace and security in the Far East, and also a contribution to the development of international cooperation based on the well-known and internationally widely recognized Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It goes without saying that the Soviet Union is willing to undertake solemn obligations to respect Japan's neutrality.

The Soviet government hopes that the Japanese government will treat the opinions expressed in our statement with the utmost seriousness. December 2, 1958

### 苏联就日美修改“安全条约”发表声明  签订新的军事条约只能给日本人民带来新灾难  奉行中立和独立和平政策才是日本安全的保证

    苏联就日美修改“安全条约”发表声明
    签订新的军事条约只能给日本人民带来新灾难
    奉行中立和独立和平政策才是日本安全的保证
    新华社3日讯  塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯12月2日接见了日本驻苏联大使门胁季光，把苏联政府关于日美两国举行修改“安全条约”的谈判的声明交给他。声明全文如下：
    美国和日本两国今年10月4日在东京开始举行关于修改所谓“安全条约”的谈判。这个条约是美国和日本在1951年9月签订的，美国根据这个条约实际上继续占领着日本。
    “安全条约”是在违反日本人民的意志和民族利益的情况下缔结的。只要看一看下面这个事实就很明显了：根据这个条约，美国从日本政府获得了在日本领土上和靠近日本的地方驻扎美国陆、海、空军部队的权利，并且由美国自行使用这些部队。
    因此，美国现在在日本领土上拥有许多军事基地。这些远离美国几千公里，并装备有原子武器和火箭武器的军事基地，是用来实现侵略目的的，因为它们同美国的安全毫无关系。经验表明，在美国武装部队侵略朝鲜时，日本的领土曾被用来当作跳板。在美国对中华人民共和国采取侵略行动时，美国的武装部队曾从日本领土上调往台湾和台湾海峡地区。
    这一切都说明，日本领土上的美国军事基地正在威胁着亚洲各国爱好和平的人民，这些基地直接针对日本在远东的各个邻国，其中包括苏联和中华人民共和国。
    大家都清楚地知道，自从签订上述条约以来，日本人民一直在进行着坚决的斗争。他们这种斗争不仅是为了取消在日本领土上的美国军事基地，而且也是为了废除这个条约。因为这个条约侮辱了日本人民的民族感并且违背日本人民的意志，使他们受着原子战争的威胁。
    苏联人民以及各国爱好和平的人民都了解和支持日本人民要求摆脱外国占领、保证日本沿着和平和与其他国家、首先是日本的邻国友好合作的道路发展的愿望。
    日本与苏联、中华人民共和国以及包括美国在内的其他国家的良好关系的发展，会有助于建立远东各国之间的必要的信任，但这种信任目前是不存在的。日本同美国之间的关系越来越具有成为在美国领导下的军事侵略集团的性质，苏联人民对这一点不能不感到忧虑。
    根据来自日本和美国的消息，美国政府正设法同日本缔结这样一个条约：根据这个条约，美国有权继续在日本境内驻扎武装部队，并能在日本领土以外利用日本的武装力量反对其他国家。由于这样做是粗暴地违反日本宪法，因而他们一再企图修改宪法，特别是宪法的第九条。这一条规定，日本永远放弃战争、放弃用武力作为解决国际争端的手段。所有这一切都证明，那些对美国现行外交政策负责的美国人士和他们在日本的支持者，正在把日本拖上帝国主义和报复主义的危险道路。
    美国和日本之间在进行关于缔结军事条约谈判时，还虚伪地宣传“双方权利平等，义务平等”，但事情并未因此而改变。这种宣传的用意在于，引用臆造的“权利平等，义务平等”来掩盖上述危险计划，并掩盖强迫日本民族接受的义务的奴役性质。因为这些义务规定，在日本领土上保留美国军事基地和利用日本武装力量来实现违反日本人民的民族利益的侵略计划。
    在日本有人企图为日本领土上存在着美国军事基地这一事实辩解，他们的借口是，1950年2月14日签订的苏中友好同盟互助条约威胁着日本。苏联政府认为有必要提醒注意，这个条约规定的措施纯粹是苏中两国一旦遭到侵略时所应采取的防御性的措施，而根本不是针对着日本或任何其他国家的。如果日本执行对苏联和中华人民共和国友好和平的政策，那么它就不必由于苏中条约的存在而感到提心吊胆。苏联和中华人民共和国坚决执行同一切国家和平共处的政策，毫无侵略包括日本在内的任何国家的打算。
    苏联政府一贯致力于保卫和平和同日本发展睦邻关系，它曾不止一次地提醒日本政府注意，日本领土上存在外国军事基地、把核武器运入日本以及把日本领土供给美国作为对远东进行侵略活动之用，这一切都使日本有被拖入战争冒险的危险，而战争冒险的后果将会使日本人民付出极其惨重的代价。
    日本政府在回答苏联政府的文件时说，日本政府没有用核武器装备日本武装部队，没有赞同从美国向日本输入核武器，日本的对外政策是以维护和平和同各国人民加强友好关系的愿望为基础的。遗憾得很，日本政府的政策是和这些声明相违背的，美国和日本现在正在进行目的在于使美日军事联盟更富有侵略性的谈判，再一次证明了这一点。
    缔结日美军事条约的计划，大家知道，不是今天、也不是昨天才有的；如果缔结了日美军事条约，那就不仅意味着保持美国在日本领土上的军事基地，并且直接把日本拖入作为实行帝国主义政策和镇压东方各国人民解放运动工具的东南亚条约组织之类的军事集团，而加入这个集团实际上就是加入在美国庇护下建立的侵略集团的整个体系。
    日本政府承担派遣军队到国外去参与实现上述集团领导人计划的义务，这种做法严重地违背远东和平的利益，并且在不小的程度上也严重地违背日本安全的利益。在这种情况下，日本武装部队被利用来执行宪兵的职责，首先是被利用来反对亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动。在这方面回忆一下过去的情况并不是多余的：日本过去对许多亚洲国家进行的帝国主义侵略，只是引起了这些国家的人民对日本的仇恨，而日本人民则不得不为日本帝国主义者的冒险政策付出了昂贵的代价。
    但是，有过惨痛经验的日本人民现在还愿意这样做吗？
    走这条道路，只能给日本人民带来新的灾难，这种灾难比他们过去所经历的要严重得多和悲惨得多。
    新军事条约的策划者企图阻挠日本同它的近邻——苏联和中华人民共和国——建立和发展睦邻关系，把日本拖入备战活动中，以便使日本人民成为新冒险行为的炮灰。
    不难看出，新的日美军事条约的签订，只会使远东局势更加复杂化，只会更加加深这一地区军事冲突的危险。这一点特别应该着重指出，因为在我们这个时代有着种种类型的大规模毁灭性武器，如原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器等。这种武器的使用对任何一个国家来说都具有巨大的危险，而对那些人口稠密、物质和其他资源集中在不大的领土上的国家来说，特别具有毁灭性的危险。
    苏联政府要日本政府注意这个问题决不是因为苏联政府有意渲染或企图吓唬谁。它认为有必要声明这点，是为了再一次强调，在国际政治中采取任何加剧原子战争威胁的步骤，是包藏着多么大的危险。任何一国政府，只要它真正珍视本国人民的幸福和真正关心和平的命运，都应当致力于防止这种战争。
    苏联政府认为，日本放弃过去强加于它的奴役性军事义务、取消在本国领土上（包括冲绳岛和小笠原群岛）的外国军事基地和从它的领土上撤出一切外国军队，将是符合加强普遍和平的利益、日本本民族的利益和其他各国人民的利益的。
    日本安全最可靠的保证是坚定不移地遵守日本自己宪法中规定的日本放弃复活军国主义和战争的原则以及为日本遵守中立提供可能性的原则。正是这条道路——中立和日本执行独立和平政策的道路，才会使日本成为一个真正独立的国家和保障它的真正的安全。
    苏联政府认为，日本奉行中立政策将是对远东和平和安全事业的一个重大的建设性的贡献，并且也是对发展以著名的和得到国际上广泛承认的和平共处五项原则为基础的国际合作的贡献。不言而喻，苏联愿意承担尊重日本中立的庄严义务。
    苏联政府希望，日本政府将会极其认真地对待我们声明中所陈述的意见。  1958年12月2日
