    Cold Muddy Fields Grow Thousand-Jin Rice
    Wang Guoben, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Jiangxi Lichuan County Committee
    Last winter, some people in Lichuan County predicted that it would be impossible to achieve a per-mu grain yield of 500 jin in 1958. Only a year has passed, and what are the facts? The average per-mu yield of the county's 312,237 mu of rice is not 500 jin, but more than 1,000 jin, nearly doubling the grain production target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, and more than quadrupling the 1957 figure.
    This is a world-shaking change. From now on, in Lichuan County, which has always been low-yielding, the grain problem has been basically solved.
          Backward Appearance Can Be Changed
    Lichuan County is located on the border of eastern Jiangxi, with the Wuyi Mountain range running through it. The county is full of overlapping mountains and the climate is cold. More than half of the land is cold muddy fields and hardpan fields, which are difficult to cultivate. Moreover, there is more land than people, and most of it is single-season late rice. Before liberation, the average per-mu yield was only 150 jin.
    Since liberation, grain production has increased year by year, with an average per-mu yield of 297 jin in 1957. This rate of increase was slow. The main reason was that the leadership's thinking was constrained by natural conditions and lacked the courage to fight against the natural environment.
    How can we change the backward natural appearance of the mountainous Lichuan County? We believe that to transform nature, we must first understand nature and explore the objective laws for changing the backward appearance of the mountains.
    In 1956, several leading comrades of the county party committee went deep into the better-performing Happiness Cooperative and "May 1st" Cooperative to jointly study ways to increase production with the members. The Happiness Cooperative changed from soaking seeds seven days after the "Spring Equinox" to soaking seeds during the "Start of Spring" period. This year, 1,557 mu of single-season late rice were converted to double-season rice, with a per-mu yield of 444 jin. The double-season rice planted by the "May 1st" Cooperative also reached a per-mu yield of 417 jin. After a year of practice, we realized that we must break with convention, advance the season, change single-season to double-season, and correspondingly promote a series of advanced production-increasing measures.
    The large-scale bumper harvest achieved by the Happiness Cooperative and "May 1st" Cooperative was not a matter of natural advantage, but the result of people going all out to overcome nature. Since these two cooperatives can achieve bumper harvests on barren land, why can't other places in the county?
    In the winter of 1957, the wave of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture spread to the Wuyi Mountains. The county party committee initially put forward a plan to "realize double cropping and exceed the target outlined in the agricultural program." However, habitual forces have a deep influence on people's thinking. "The theory of mountainous backwardness" and "the theory of conditions" blinded people's eyes, making them unable to see the situation of rapid development and the road ahead. The county party committee launched a resolute struggle against this right-leaning conservative thinking of being content with backwardness. The county party committee used the examples of increased production in the Happiness Cooperative and "May 1st" Cooperative to refute the pessimistic arguments of the conservatives and comprehensively analyzed the current situation of rapid development. As a result, everyone's thinking was liberated, confidence in increasing production was doubled, and agricultural production increase challenge competitions were launched between districts, townships, and cooperatives, forming a strong atmosphere of "everyone striving to be upstream and everyone striving to be the first."
          Three Upsurges, Three Major Campaigns
    Through the previous stage of struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking, we deeply realized that letting go of mobilizing the masses, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and concentrating the wisdom and strength of the masses are the fundamental reasons for achieving victory. Then, in the next step of organizing actions, making a decisive battle with nature, and realizing the battle for increasing production plans, we must carry out mass movements on a larger scale and mobilize all the positive factors of the people of the county. In this year, we fully mobilized the masses through organizing three upsurges and three major campaigns, seizing the time, seizing the initiative, and finally achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest in grain production.
    The three upsurges refer to the water conservancy upsurge, the manure accumulation upsurge, and the winter plowing upsurge.
    The initial victory in the battle against nature last winter and this spring laid a good material and ideological foundation for realizing the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in 1958. The broad masses of cadres and people further believed in their own strength, broke down superstitions, and proposed revising the production increase plan. Around the "Awakening of Insects," they began to lead the masses in soaking and sowing seeds. Many mountainous agricultural cooperatives adopted methods such as setting fires in the fields to raise the temperature and boiling warm water at home to irrigate the seedling fields to raise the water temperature, overcoming the cold wave.
    Around the "Qingming" Festival, rice transplanting was fully started. Transplanting rice was the first battle to strive for a bumper harvest this year. The county party committee made careful arrangements, party committees at all levels went to the front line, and each level was contracted, all departments and industries fully supported, and the people of the county fought hard for twenty days, finally completing the early rice transplanting task six days before the "Start of Summer."
    Summer harvesting and summer planting is another battle of decisive significance in striving for a bumper harvest this year. Because 300,000 mu of early rice and 200,000 mu of late rice, which is equivalent to five times last year's acreage, need to be completed before the "Start of Autumn." If calculated based on the county's labor force, each person has to complete more than one mu of harvesting and planting tasks per day. Under such circumstances, people with right-leaning conservative thinking wavered again, and they proposed compressing the late rice planting plan. The county party committee resolutely negated this regressive approach and made new strategic deployments for summer harvesting and summer planting, putting forward the slogan of "the front and rear working together, fighting hard for twenty days to complete the harvesting and planting," and organized an army of 70,000 people, accounting for more than 60% of the county's total population, to fiercely attack the "dual rush pass." More than 1,500 cadres throughout the county went to the fields to direct the battle, and the entire population was mobilized to complete all the summer harvesting and summer planting tasks three days before the "Start of Autumn." This huge victory could not help but leave the right-leaning conservatives dumbfounded. Their "crawling" thinking, which was willing to be a slave of nature and dared not act rashly, once again hit a wall in the face of the rapidly developing situation of "one day equals twenty years."
    Similarly, the people of the county demonstrated the revolutionary drive of summer harvesting and summer planting, and in the case of vigorously carrying out the iron and steel "Huaihai Campaign," they successfully completed the autumn harvest and winter planting tasks in seven days of blitz, which was another victory in the campaign.
            Turned the Universe Around
    1958 was an extraordinary year. A year ago, some people regarded the per-mu grain yield of 500 jin in Lichuan County as an insurmountable natural barrier. Now, this outdated concept has been completely shattered. The realm of the so-called "thousands of mountains connected to thousands of mountains, cold muddy fields under cliffs, suffering thousands of hardships a year, and unable to eat grain until the end of the year" has been fundamentally changed by the heroic people of Lichuan County with the spirit of turning the universe around. From now on, Lichuan County has entered a new stage from the past where people were enslaved by nature to where people conquer nature.

    冷浆田长千斤稻
    中共江西黎川县委副书记  王国本
    去年冬天，黎川县曾经有人预言，1958年粮食亩产五百斤是不可能的。时间仅仅过了一年，事实如何呢？全县三十一万二千二百三十七亩水稻，平均亩产不是五百斤，而是一千多斤，接近一倍地跨越全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食生产指标，比1957年增加四倍多。
    这是一个翻天复地的变化。从此，在一贯低产的黎川县，粮食问题已经基本上解决了。
          落后面貌能改变
    黎川县位于赣东边境，武夷山系横贯其间。全县山峦重叠，气候寒冷。半数以上是山排冷浆田和硬板田，耕作不易，而且田多人少，绝大部分为一季晚稻，解放前平均亩产只有一百五十斤。
    解放以来，粮食产量逐年提高，1957年平均亩产二百九十七斤。这种增产速度是缓慢的。主要原因是，领导思想受自然条件的束缚，缺乏向自然环境作斗争的勇气。
    怎样才能改变黎川县山区落后的自然面貌呢？我们认为，要改造自然，首先要认识自然，摸索出改变山区落后面貌的客观规律。
    1956年，县委几个领导同志分头深入基础较好的幸福社和“五一”社，和社员共同研究增产的途径。幸福社这年由“春分”后七天浸种，改为“惊蛰”浸种。这一年，将一千五百五十七亩一季晚稻改为双季稻，亩产达到四百四十四斤。“五一”社改种的双季稻，亩产也达到四百一十七斤。经过一年的实践，使我们体会到：必须打破常规，提早季节，将单季变双季，相应地推行一系列的先进增产措施。
    幸福社和“五一”社取得大面积丰收，并不是得天独厚，而是人们鼓足干劲战胜自然的结果。既然这两个社能在贫瘠的土地上取得丰收，为什么全县其他地方不能呢？
    1957年冬天，农业大跃进的声浪传到武夷山区。县委初步提出了“实现双季化，亩产跨纲要”的计划。但是，习惯势力对人们的思想影响是很深的。“山区落后论”、“唯条件论”蒙蔽了人们的眼睛，看不清飞跃发展的形势和前进的道路。县委对这种自甘落后的右倾保守思想展开了坚决的斗争。县委用幸福社、“五一”社增产的事例，驳斥了保守分子的悲观论调，全面地分析了当前飞跃发展的形势。因而，人人思想解放，增产信心百倍，区与区、乡与乡、社与社之间开展了农业增产挑战竞赛，形成了“人人争上游、个个争第一”的浓厚气氛。
          三个高潮，三大战役
    通过前一阶段反右倾保守思想的斗争，我们深深体会到：放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，集中群众的智慧和力量，是取得胜利的根本原因。那么，下一步在组织行动，向自然决战，实现增产计划的战斗中，更必须大搞群众运动，把全县人民的积极因素都调动起来。在这一年中，我们通过组织三个高潮，三大战役，充分发动了群众，争取了时间，争取了主动，终于取得了粮食生产的全面大丰收。
    三个高潮，是指水利高潮，积肥高潮，冬翻高潮。
    去冬今春向自然进军的初战胜利，为实现1958年农业大跃进奠定了良好的物质基础和思想基础，广大干部、群众进一步相信自己的力量，破除了迷信，纷纷提出修订增产计划。“惊蛰”前后，即着手领导群众浸种播种。许多山区农业社采取田头生火，提高气温，家家烧温水浇秧田，提高水温等办法，战胜了寒潮。
    “清明”前后，即全面开始插秧。插秧，是争取今年大丰收的第一次战役。县委进行了周密布置，各级党委亲临前线，层层包干，各部门、各行业全力支援，全县人民奋战二十天，终于在“立夏”前六天完成早稻插秧任务。
    夏收夏种，是争取今年大丰收具有决定意义的另一次战役。因为，相当于去年五倍的三十万亩早稻和二十万亩晚稻需要在“立秋”前完成。如果按全县劳动力计算，平均每人每天要完成一亩多田的收种任务。在这种情况下，有右倾保守思想的人又动摇了，他们提出压缩晚稻栽种计划。县委坚决否定了这种促退的作法，对夏收夏种作了新的战略部署，提出“前方后方协同作战，苦战二十天完成收种”的口号，组织占全县总人口60％以上的七万大军，猛攻“双抢关”。全县一千五百多名干部走向田间指挥战斗，全民总动员，在“立秋”前三天全部完成夏收夏种任务。这一巨大的胜利，不得不使右倾保守分子目瞪口呆。他们那种甘愿作自然的奴隶，不敢轻举妄动的“爬行”思想，在“一天等于二十年”的飞跃发展的形势面前，又一次碰壁了。
    同样地，全县人民拿出了夏收夏种的革命干劲，在大搞钢铁“淮海战役”的情况下，突击七天，顺利完成了秋收冬种任务，这是又一战役的胜利。
            扭  转  了  乾  坤
    1958年是不平凡的一年。一年以前，某些人把在黎川县亩产粮食五百斤看成是一道不可逾越的天河，现在，这种陈腐的观念已彻底粉碎了。以前所谓的“千山万山山连山，悬崖底下冷浆田，一年受尽千辛苦，粮食不能吃到年”的境界，已被黎川县英雄的人民，以扭转乾坤的气魄，根本加以改变了。从此，黎川县已经由过去人们被自然奴役进入到人们征服自然的新阶段。
