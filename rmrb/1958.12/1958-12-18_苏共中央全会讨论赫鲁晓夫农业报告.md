Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: According to TASS, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued in Moscow on the 16th. The session began to discuss the report by N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on the results of Soviet agricultural development over the past five years and the tasks of further increasing agricultural production.

Nineteen delegates spoke at the meeting, including secretaries of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, leaders of regional Party organizations, and representatives of collective and state farms.

N.V. Podgorny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, said that the output of meat and milk in Ukraine (calculated as the average output per hundred hectares of land) has greatly exceeded that of the United States. The total grain output of Ukraine has increased by almost 20% compared with the previous five-year period. During this period, the average annual output of meat from collective and state farms has more than doubled, milk has tripled, and wool has increased by 70%. By 1965, Ukraine can produce 2.1 billion poods of grain, and the yield per unit area of grain can reach 20 centners per hectare (this year it is 17 centners).

D.A. Belyayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kazakh Communist Party, pointed out when talking about the land reclamation issue that the resolute decision made on the land reclamation issue based on Khrushchev's suggestion was completely correct. Due to the reclamation of 23 million hectares of wasteland, the sown area of Kazakhstan has doubled, and thus the average annual grain output has increased from 245 million poods in 1949-1953 to 827 million poods in 1954-1958.

The delegates who spoke at the meeting all emphasized that due to the complete victory of the Party's general line, the political bankruptcy of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov is even more obvious.

    苏共中央全会讨论赫鲁晓夫农业报告
    新华社17日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议16日在莫斯科继续举行。会议开始讨论苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫关于最近五年来苏联农业发展的结果和进一步增加农产品产量的任务的报告。
    在会上发言的代表共有十九人，其中有加盟共和国共产党中央委员会书记、各地区的党组织的领导人以及集体农庄和国营农场的代表。
    乌克兰共产党中央委员会第一书记波德戈尔内说：乌克兰的肉类和牛奶产量（按每一百公顷土地平均产量计算）已大大超过美国。乌克兰的谷物总产量几乎比前一个五年增加了20％，这一时期集体农庄和国营农场的肉类平均年产量增加了一倍多，牛奶增加了两倍，羊毛增加了70％。到1965年，乌克兰可以生产二十一亿普特的粮食，谷物的单位面积产量可以达到每公顷二十公担（今年为十七公担）。
    哈萨克共产党中央委员会第一书记别利亚耶夫谈到垦荒问题时指出，根据赫鲁晓夫建议，对垦荒问题作出的果断的决定是完全正确的。由于开垦了二千三百万公顷荒地，哈萨克播种面积扩大了两倍，因而谷物的平均年产量从1949—1953年的二亿四千五百万普特增加到1954—1958年的八亿二千七百万普特。
    在会上发言的代表们都强调指出，由于党的总路线的完全胜利，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团的政治破产是更加明显了。
