Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: More than 1,000 Communist Party cadres in Beijing held a celebration tonight to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party. The celebration was organized by the Central Higher Party School of the CPC. The Chinese Communist Party members present extended warm, fraternal congratulations to the German Communist Party, which is engaged in arduous struggles.

    Since its founding on December 30, 1918, the German Communist Party has been engaged in arduous struggles against reactionary forces and militarist forces for forty years. The Chinese working class and all working people have always expressed heartfelt concern and lofty respect for the struggles of the communists in the country that gave birth to such a great revolutionary as Marx. Two years ago, when the West German authorities frantically declared the German Communist Party illegal, people from all walks of life in Beijing held an angry protest rally together with Comrade Reimann, First Secretary of the German Communist Party, who was in China attending the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, expressing their firm support for the German Communist Party.

    At today's celebration, Yang Xianzhen, member of the Central Committee of the CPC and President of the Central Higher Party School of the CPC, once again expressed his support for the struggle waged by the German Communist Party. He said that those who judge the Communist Party today will be judged by the people tomorrow. The ranks of the German Communist Party and the people of West Germany will temper themselves to be stronger and more combat-effective in this struggle.

    The celebration was held in the auditorium of the CPPCC. Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC, and Wu Xiuquan, member of the Central Committee of the CPC, attended the celebration. Comrade Kang Sheng announced the opening of the celebration at 7 p.m.

    Invited to participate in the celebration were a representative of the German Communist Party currently visiting China, the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Guozhang [汪戴尔, likely a transliteration error], Hanna Wolf, member of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and President of the Karl Marx Higher Party School, and Horst Sindermann, alternate member of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and Minister of the Central Propaganda Department.

    Comrade Yang Xianzhen said at the meeting that today we, together with the working people of all Germany, are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party with pride and excitement. The Chinese Communists extend warm, fraternal congratulations to the German Communist Party and the German Socialist Unity Party.

    Yang Xianzhen then recounted the glorious path the German Communist Party has taken since its birth under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution. He said that on December 30, 1918, the most outstanding representatives of the German working class founded the German Communist Party in Berlin. The establishment of this new type of party was a turning point in the history of the German workers' movement. Its resolute break with opportunism in organization was an important step in the reunification of the German workers' movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

    Yang Xianzhen said that during the Hitler fascist dictatorship and World War II, the German Communist Party underwent the most severe tests. Under extremely difficult conditions, the German Communist Party fought unyieldingly to overthrow the Hitler regime and strive for a democratic Germany. In this struggle, the German Communist Party made significant sacrifices.

    He said that thanks to the great victory of the Soviet Union in the anti-fascist war, the people of eastern Germany were freed from capitalism and embarked on the broad road of socialist construction. The fraternal cooperation between the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the German Communist Party in eastern Germany has been consolidated under new historical conditions, and the German Socialist Unity Party was established in April 1946.

    Yang Xianzhen spoke about the brilliant achievements made by the German Democratic Republic under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party since its establishment, and that due to its increasing strength, it is becoming a strong bulwark for maintaining peace and security in Europe. However, after World War II, West Germany developed along another path. From the beginning, the imperialist countries adopted a policy of dividing Germany, restoring German imperialism, and making it a U.S. war base in Europe. The Federal Republic of Germany, fostered by U.S. imperialism, has become a tool to obstruct the reunification of the German people on a peaceful and democratic basis and a factor threatening European security.

    Yang Xianzhen said that in the struggle of the West German people against war, against division, against remilitarization, and for the establishment of an independent, unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, the German Communist Party has always stood at the forefront, fighting steadfastly. On August 17, 1956, the West German authorities, disregarding the opposition of world justice, declared the German Communist Party illegal. This is a Hitler-style reactionary act, which precisely shows the weakness of the West German reactionary government, not its strength. Yang Xianzhen emphasized that in the country that gave birth to such a great revolutionary as Marx, in a place with a long and glorious tradition of the communist movement, and under the conditions that the German Democratic Republic has been established where the German people are their own masters, it is absolutely impossible to eliminate the Communist Party.

    Speaking of this, Yang Xianzhen once again expressed, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, his fraternal respect to the Central Committee of the German Communist Party headed by Comrade Reimann, and to the German Communists who are holding high the banner against militarism, and expressed his cordial greetings to all the heroic German Communists who are imprisoned in the prisons of the West German authorities, and expressed his firm demand that the West German authorities restore the legal status of the German Communist Party. His words aroused warm applause from the audience.

    Yang Xianzhen pointed out that today, more than two years since the German Communist Party was banned, a seriously disturbing situation has developed in West Germany. The German monopoly capitalist groups and militarists who launched the two world wars in the past have once again seized power. In order to realize their "revanchist" ambitions, the West German government closely follows the chariot of U.S. imperialism and acts as its accomplice.

    Referring to the West Berlin issue, Yang Xianzhen said that West Berlin, under the military occupation of Western countries, has become a paradise for German militarists and a center of the Cold War. Because West Berlin is located in the heart of the German Democratic Republic, the U.S., British, French, and West German governments use it as a springboard to threaten and subvert the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. They have established more than eighty spy agencies in West Berlin, using newspapers, radio stations, sending spies, digging tunnels, and even planning armed riots to carry out destructive and war provocations. All of this is enough to prove that West Berlin has become a malignant tumor, and if this malignant tumor is not eliminated, there will be a danger of very bad consequences. Recently, the Soviet Union proposed ending the occupied status of Berlin and making West Berlin a demilitarized free city. This proposal is particularly conducive to the easing of tensions in Europe and the world. There is no reason for the U.S., British, and French troops to remain in West Berlin any longer.

    Yang Xianzhen concluded by saying that the imperialist reactionaries are doing all kinds of bad things; the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day. The cause of peace and socialism will surely achieve new and greater victories.

    A representative of the German Communist Party was invited to speak at the meeting, and the audience welcomed him with warm applause. He said that December 30th is of great significance to the German working class's struggle against imperialism and war, for democracy and socialism, and to the fate of the entire German people.

    The representative spoke about the arduous struggle that the German Communist Party has undergone. He said that the bourgeois state machine has used all its strength to deal with the German Communist Party. In the fascist darkness, the German Communist Party fought fearlessly. Among its 300,000 members, 145,000 were arrested, subjected to brutal torture, and some were tortured to death. Their struggle, their lives, and sacrifices saved the honor of the German people.

    When the German Communist Party representative spoke about the current situation in West Germany, he sternly denounced the West German militarists' expansionist ambitions, exposed the militarists' plans for "revenge," and condemned U.S. imperialism for vigorously encouraging German imperialism to play the role of the gendarme of the European reactionaries. The representative of the German Communist Party emphasized that the aggressive militarist forces in West Germany must be crushed, otherwise, peace cannot be guaranteed.

    He also said that the Berlin issue has recently become the center of world public opinion, and the German Socialist Unity Party will spare no effort to fight against the frontline city policy pursued by the three occupying powers, the United States, Britain, and France, from West Berlin against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. He said that the international working class can rest assured that the German Socialist Unity Party will surely make the whole of Berlin a city of peace.

    The German Communist Party representative revealed that the international reactionaries have a large number of spy organizations in West Berlin, and the general commander of these spy organizations is the U.S. Secretary of State's sister, the international female spy Ellena Dulles. The imperialists have also turned West Berlin into a paradise for criminals, because West Berlin maintains the world record today in criminal offenses, promiscuity, and prostitution.

    Finally, the German Communist Party representative said with excitement that on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party, we pay tribute to the millions of fearless warriors who fought yesterday and today for the noble goals of mankind. On this day, the revolutionaries of the Hamburg Uprising pay tribute to the heroes of the immortal Guangzhou Commune, and the German comrades pay tribute to their Chinese brothers. His words aroused a storm of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    北京庆祝德共成立四十周年
    杨献珍和德共代表在庆祝会上谈德共的英勇斗争
    新华社28日讯  北京一千多名共产党员干部今晚举行庆祝德国共产党成立四十周年大会。庆祝会由中共中央高级党校举办。到会的中国共产党党员们向正在进行艰苦斗争的德国共产党表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    德国共产党从1918年12月30日成立以来，四十年如一日，一直同反动势力、军国主义势力进行着艰苦的斗争。中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民，对于在诞生了像马克思这样伟大革命家的国度里的共产党人的斗争，始终表示亲切的关怀和崇高的敬意。两年以前，当西德当局疯狂地宣布德国共产党为非法的时候，北京各界人民曾经同正在中国参加中共八大第一次会议的德国共产党第一书记雷曼同志一起，愤怒地举行了抗议集会，表示对德国共产党的坚决支持。
    在今天的庆祝大会上，中共中央委员、中共中央高级党校校长杨献珍在讲话中，再一次表示了对德国共产党所进行的斗争的支持，他说，那些今天判决共产党的人，在明天将要受到人民的判决。德国共产党的队伍和西德人民将在这一斗争中把自己锻炼得更加坚强，更富于战斗力。
    庆祝大会在政协礼堂举行。中共中央政治局候补委员康生、中共中央委员伍修权出席了大会。康生同志在七时宣布庆祝大会开始。
    应邀参加庆祝大会的有正在中国访问的一位德国共产党的代表和德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔，德国统一社会党中央委员、卡尔·马克思高级党校校长汉娜·沃尔夫，德国统一社会党中央候补委员、中央宣传部部长豪斯特·辛德曼。
    杨献珍同志在会上说，今天我们同全德国的劳动人民一起，怀着骄傲和兴奋的心情，庆祝德国共产党成立四十周年，中国共产党人向德国共产党和德国统一社会党致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    杨献珍接着追述了德国共产党在伟大十月社会主义革命影响下诞生以来所走过的光辉道路。他说，1918年12月30日，德国工人阶级最优秀的代表在柏林成立了德国共产党，这个新型政党的建立是德国工人运动史上的一个转折点。它在组织上和机会主义断然决裂是德国工人运动在马克思列宁主义基础上重新统一的一个重要步骤。
    杨献珍说，在希特勒法西斯专政和第二次世界大战期间，德国共产党经受了最严重的考验。在极端困难的条件下，德国共产党不屈不挠地为推翻希特勒的政权和争取民主的德国进行了英勇的斗争。在这个斗争中德国共产党付出了重大的牺牲。
    他说，由于苏联在反法西斯战争中得到了伟大的胜利，德国东部人民摆脱了资本主义，走上社会主义建设的康庄大道。德国东部地区社会民主党和德国共产党之间的兄弟般的合作，在新的历史条件下得到了巩固，并在1946年4月成立了德国统一社会党。
    杨献珍谈到了在德国统一社会党领导下的德意志民主共和国从成立以来所取得的光辉成就，并且由于它的日益强大，正在成为维护欧洲和平和安全的坚强堡垒。可是，第二次世界大战后，西德却沿着另一条道路发展。帝国主义国家从开始就采取一种分裂德国，恢复德国帝国主义，使它成为美国在欧洲战争基地的政策。美帝国主义一手扶植的德意志联邦共和国成为阻挠德国人民在和平和民主基础上统一的工具和威胁欧洲安全的因素。
    杨献珍说，在西德人民反对战争、反对分裂、反对重新军国主义化，要求建立一个独立、统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的斗争中，德国共产党始终站在最前列，坚定不移地进行战斗。1956年8月17日，西德当局不顾世界正义舆论的反对，宣布德国共产党为非法，这是一种希特勒式的反动行径，它恰恰说明西德反动政府的虚弱，而不是说明它的强大。杨献珍强调说，在诞生了像马克思这样伟大的革命家的国度里，在拥有悠久和光辉的共产主义运动的传统的地方，在成立了德国人民自己当家作主的德意志民主共和国的条件下，要消灭共产党是绝对办不到的事情。
    杨献珍讲到这里，他再一次代表中国共产党向以雷曼同志为首的德国共产党中央委员会，向高举着反对军国主义旗帜的德国共产党人致以兄弟般的敬意，向一切被西德当局监禁在监牢里的英勇的德国共产党人致以亲切的慰问，并且表示坚决要求西德当局恢复德国共产党的合法地位。他的话激起全场热烈的掌声。
    杨献珍指出，在德国共产党被禁止两年多以来的今天，西德已形成了令人严重不安的局面。过去发动了两次世界大战的德国垄断资本集团和军国主义分子，又重新掌握了政权。为了实现“复仇主义”的野心，西德政府紧紧追随于美帝国主义的战车之后，为虎作伥。
    杨献珍谈到西柏林问题时说，在西方国家军事占领下的西柏林，已变成为一个德国军国主义者的乐园和冷战中心。由于西柏林处在德意志民主共和国的心脏地位，美国、英国、法国和西德政府把它作为威胁和颠复德意志民主共和国及其他社会主义国家的跳板。他们在西柏林建立了八十几个特务间谍机构，利用报刊、电台、派遣特务、挖地道直到策划武装暴动等等一系列的罪恶活动进行破坏和战争挑衅。凡此种种都足以证明，西柏林已经变成了一个毒瘤，如果不消除这个毒瘤，就会有导致十分不良后果的危险。最近苏联提出结束柏林的被占领状态，并且使西柏林成为非军事的自由城市的建议。这个建议特别有利于欧洲和世界紧张局势的和缓。美国、英国和法国的军队没有任何理由再停留在西柏林。
    杨献珍最后说，帝国主义反动派尽做坏事，敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。和平和社会主义事业必将获得新的更加伟大的胜利。
    德国共产党的一位代表应邀在会上讲话，全场以热烈的掌声欢迎他。他说，12月30日这个日子，对德国工人阶级反对帝国主义和战争、争取民主和社会主义的斗争，对全德人民的命运都具有重大的意义。
    这位代表谈到了德国共产党所走过的艰苦斗争的道路。他说，资产阶级国家机器用尽全付力量来对付德国共产党。在法西斯的黑夜里，德国共产党无畏地进行斗争，在三十万党员中，有十四万五千人被逮捕，受尽严刑酷打，有的被折磨致死。他们的斗争，他们的一生和牺牲，挽救了德国人民的荣誉。
    这位德共代表在谈到西德目前的状况时，严厉地斥责了西德军国主义的扩张野心，揭露了军国主义分子准备“复仇”的计划，并且谴责了美帝国主义正在极力怂恿德国帝国主义扮演欧洲反动派宪兵的角色。这位德共代表强调说，西德侵略性的军国主义势力必须粉碎，除此而外，和平就不可能得到保障。
    他还说，柏林问题最近成为世界舆论的中心，德国统一社会党将不遗余力地向美英法三个占领国所推行的从西柏林出发反对德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家的前线城市政策进行斗争。他说，国际工人阶级可以放心，德国统一社会党一定会使整个柏林成为和平的城市。
    这位德共代表揭露说，国际反动派在西柏林拥有大批的间谍组织，对这些间谍组织实行总指挥的是美国国务卿的妹妹、国际女间谍叶林娜·杜勒斯。帝国主义者还把西柏林变成了罪犯的乐园，因为西柏林在刑事犯罪、淫乱及卖淫方面今天保持着世界纪录。
    这位德共代表最后怀着激动的心情说，在德国共产党成立四十周年之际，我们向昨天和今天为了人类崇高的目标而斗争的千百万无畏的战士致敬。在今天的这个日子里，汉堡起义的革命者向不朽的广州公社的英雄致敬，德国的同志们向他们的中国兄弟致敬。他的这些话在全场引起了暴风雨般的热烈的掌声。
