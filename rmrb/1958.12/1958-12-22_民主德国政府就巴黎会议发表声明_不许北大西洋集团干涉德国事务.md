Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 21st: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic today issued a statement regarding the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, stating that the resolutions of this meeting concerning West Berlin are a "crude interference in the affairs of the German Democratic Republic. The government of the German Democratic Republic most resolutely opposes this resolution."

The statement pointed out, "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has no rights whatsoever in West Berlin—such ‘rights’ can never be determined by the unilateral resolutions of some conference at any time." The attempt by the North Atlantic Group "will only lead to a continued deterioration of the situation. The German Democratic Republic and all other peace-loving countries will not allow this to happen, and will never allow the North Atlantic Group to become the protector of West Berlin in the future."

The statement said that the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council shows that they are trying to make the occupation of West Berlin continue indefinitely, turning West Berlin into a bridgehead for the North Atlantic Group and a saboteur of peace inside the German Democratic Republic.

The statement condemned the Bonn government for obstructing the normalization of the situation in West Berlin, attempting to drag other countries into war adventures, and deceiving West German public opinion.

The statement said that the West German government's tactic of confusing the solution to the West Berlin issue with the issue of German reunification is merely to delay preparations for a peace treaty with Germany and to delay the solution to the West Berlin issue.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet government's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the West Berlin issue is of great significance for resolving the German question. The statement said: "Transferring the powers currently exercised by Soviet organs in Berlin to the German Democratic Republic is a meaningful step towards normalizing the situation in Berlin. Any attempt to undermine the transfer is futile and will only create difficulties for the peaceful resolution of the West Berlin issue."

The statement concluded: "The government of the German Democratic Republic is ready to reach agreements on all relevant issues concerning the peaceful resolution of the West Berlin issue and the transfer of powers currently exercised by Soviet organs. The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that if all participants have good intentions, the premise for resolving the West Berlin issue as quickly as possible in a spirit of peace exists."

Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: According to TASS, Berlin, December 20th: "Radio Free Berlin 904" broadcast a statement by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany regarding the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group.

The statement severely criticized the Paris meeting for taking a negative stance on the Soviet proposal to normalize the situation in West Berlin, and pointed out that the West German government and the mayor of West Berlin did everything possible at this meeting to hinder a realistic approach to the Soviet proposals. The statement said that the Adenauer government's position leaves no doubt: it wants no negotiations, no easing of international tensions, no all-German understanding, but rather to escalate the "Cold War" and launch a "hot war" using atomic weapons.

The statement said that West Germany is becoming increasingly isolated among the European members of the North Atlantic Group. Many countries do not want to be dragged into a world war by Bonn and Washington.

The statement emphasized the urgent need for a policy of negotiation and mutual understanding for West Germany, and firmly demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, advocating the appointment of a West German representative to jointly determine Germany's views on the issue of a peace treaty with representatives of the German Democratic Republic, in order to conduct negotiations on the conclusion of a treaty with the victorious nations in the anti-Hitler war.

    民主德国政府就巴黎会议发表声明
    不许北大西洋集团干涉德国事务
    德共中央指斥西方国家对苏联建议采取否定立场
    新华社柏林21日电  德意志民主共和国部长会议今天就北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议发表声明说：这次会议对于西柏林的决议是“对民主德国事务的粗暴干涉。民主德国政府最坚决地反对这一决议。”
    声明指出，“北大西洋公约组织在西柏林没有任何权利——这种‘权利’不论什么时候都不依靠某种会议的单方面决议来确定。”北大西洋集团的企图“只会导致局势的继续恶化。民主德国和一切其他爱好和平的国家决不允许这样做，并且将来也决不会允许北大西洋集团成为西柏林的保护人”。
    声明说，北大西洋集团理事会巴黎会议表明，它们力图使西柏林的占领状态无限止地继续下去，使西柏林成为北大西洋集团的桥头堡和对民主德国内部的和平破坏者。
    声明谴责波恩政府阻挠西柏林局势的正常化，企图把其他国家卷入战争冒险并蒙蔽西德的舆论。
    声明说，西德政府把解决西柏林问题同重新统一德国问题混为一谈的手法，只是为了拖延准备对德和约和拖延对西柏林问题的解决。
    声明指出，苏联政府关于和平解决西柏林问题的建议对于解决德国问题具有巨大意义。声明说：“移交目前尚为苏联机关在柏林行使的职权给民主德国是使柏林局势正常化的有意义的步骤。任何破坏移交工作的尝试都是徒劳的，并且只会对于西柏林问题的和平解决带来困难。”
    声明最后说：“德意志民主共和国政府准备在关于和平解决西柏林问题和移交目前尚为苏联机关行使的职权的一切有关的问题上达成协议。德意志民主共和国政府认为，如果一切参加者具有善良愿望的话，以和平精神尽快解决西柏林问题的前提是存在的。”
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社柏林20日讯：“德国九零四自由广播电台”广播了德国共产党中央委员会就北大西洋集团巴黎会议发表的声明。
    声明严厉地指责巴黎会议对于苏联关于使西柏林局势正常化的建议采取否定立场，并且指出，西德政府和西柏林市长在这次会议上尽一切力量来阻碍对苏联的建议采取现实的态度。声明说，阿登纳政府的立场使人毫不怀疑：它不要谈判，不要缓和国际紧张局势，不愿意达成全德的谅解，而是要加剧“冷战”和发动使用原子武器的“热战”。
    声明说，西德在北大西洋集团的欧洲成员国中已经越来越孤立了。许多国家不希望被波恩和华盛顿拖入世界战争。
    声明强调了谈判和互相谅解的政策对于西德的迫切必要性，并且坚决要求缔结对德和约，主张任命一个西德代表同德意志民主共和国的代表一起决定德国在对德和约问题上的观点，以便同反希特勒战争中的战胜国进行关于缔结和约的谈判。
