Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 2nd: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council held a grand rally on the evening of December 1st to commemorate "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day." More than two thousand attendees shouted in unison:
	"Imperialism Get Out of Africa!"
	At the start of the meeting, Youssef El Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, read out telegrams from the Chinese and Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees, which aroused enthusiastic applause and cheers.
	Anwar al-Sadat, Chairman of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, said at the meeting that struggles against imperialism were taking place everywhere in countries such as Algeria, Kenya, and Chad. He said that imperialism had lost its senses, but history could not be turned back, and imperialism was fighting a battle doomed to fail. He expressed support for all countries fighting for freedom and independence.
	Mahjoubi, a member of the Algerian National Revolutionary Council, said at the meeting: "We have been fighting imperialism gloriously, and we will continue to fight them until they get out of our country." He condemned the atrocities committed by French imperialism against the Algerian people.
	Mohi el-Din, Chairman of the Arab United Republic Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, recalled in his speech the struggles of the Asian, Middle Eastern, and Arab peoples against imperialism and for independence since the end of World War II. He pointed out that the imperialists' conspiracies in these regions had failed, and the Baghdad Pact had become a pact without Baghdad.
	He said that as the areas exploited by imperialism shrank and the general crisis of imperialism intensified, imperialist exploitation became even more ferocious. On the rich African continent, imperialism would also adopt the old trick of divide and rule against the nationalist movement. Mohi el-Din emphasized the cooperation of the Afro-Asian peoples, saying that this was a necessary condition for the victory of the African nationalist movement.
	Mohi el-Din said, "The responsibility of the Afro-Asian peoples is to continue the struggle to drive imperialism out of Africa, to liberate this undeveloped and rich continent, so that Africa will belong to the people and become a fortress of freedom and peace."
	Afana, a representative from Cameroon and a member of the Cameroon People's Union, and Malaviya, the Indian representative of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, also spoke at the meeting.
	In his final speech, Youssef El Sebai said that since the Bandung, Cairo, and Accra conferences, the Afro-Asian solidarity movement had been constantly surging in the struggle against imperialism. He also said that as long as the Afro-Asian peoples were united, they would be victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 2nd: The public in New Delhi, the capital of India, held a mass rally today on "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day." Speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned imperialism and demanded "no interference in Africa." The conference was organized by the Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee.
	The conference unanimously passed a resolution amid cheers, guaranteeing support for the African people who are fighting for freedom. The resolution expressed the hope that the upcoming All-African People's Conference in Accra will be another milestone in the African people's struggle for freedom.
	The conference demanded "complete independence for all African countries" and demanded "the immediate release of all political prisoners and an end to the cruel oppression and suppression of the people by the imperialists."
	The conference demanded "the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the removal of foreign military bases on African soil." The conference angrily condemned the French government's plan to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara.
	Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, Chairman of the conference, demanded at the conference that imperialism get out of Africa. She said that the people of Asian countries would help the African people until they achieved independence. She pointed out that our own freedom would only be guaranteed when slavery disappeared all over the world.
	Ghana's High Commissioner to India, Mr. Arzuah, pointed out in his speech that there is a huge tide and strong desire in Africa today for freedom from the shackles of imperialism, and the imperialists cannot stifle this desire for long.
	Sudan's Minister to India, Rahimtalla Abdulla, pointed out that the realization of freedom in Africa—freedom of life and freedom of cooperation—is in the interests of Sudan and world peace.
	Ethiopia's Ambassador to India, Imru, called for consolidating the unity of Afro-Asian countries. He said that we can only achieve Africa's independence through hard work.
	Salah Abed, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Arab United Republic Embassy in India, pointed out in his speech that imperialism is doomed to destruction morally, legally, historically, economically, and politically. He said that the Arab people will devote themselves to the lofty task of liberating Africa.
	Cherif Guellal, representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, condemned the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the meeting for helping all colonial countries maintain their colonies.
	People from all walks of life, including many members of parliament, attended the conference. Pan Zili, the Chinese Ambassador to India, as well as diplomatic representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and many African students studying in Delhi also attended the conference.
	On December 1st, rallies were also held in Jaipur and Rajasthan to express solidarity with the struggle of the African people. In the coming week, rallies will be held in many other places in India to express support for the African people.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 2nd: Kamal Eddin Hussein, Minister of Education of the Arab United Republic, said in a radio address on the evening of December 1st for "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" that now is the time to eradicate imperialism so that people can gain freedom and equality.
	The minister said that the fierce cries of the people demanding that the imperialists get out of their countries are exploding, digging deep pits under the imperialists' feet, and inevitably smashing them to pieces.
	He added that getting out of Africa is today's call, and it is also every day's call until the African people achieve freedom and independence.
	The minister said that because Afro-Asian countries possess potential capabilities and resources, the imperialists are plundering these countries, but the Afro-Asian people are capable of protecting their countries with their own potential capabilities and resources. He called on young people to undertake the task of fighting for a new future without imperialism, exploitation, and aggression.

    亚非人民团结理事会举行集会
    齐声高呼“帝国主义滚出非洲”
    新德里群众大会支持斗争中的非洲人民
    新华社开罗2日电  亚非人民团结理事会书记处1日晚间举行盛大集会，纪念“帝国主义滚出非洲日”。到会的两千多人齐声高呼：
  “帝国主义滚出非洲”！
    在会议开始时，亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记西巴伊宣读了中国和朝鲜的亚非团结委员会的电报，引起了热烈的掌声和欢呼。
    亚非人民团结大会主席萨达特在会上说，在阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、乍得等国家，到处进行着反对帝国主义的斗争。他说，帝国主义已经丧失了理智，但是时代不能倒转，帝国主义正在打一个注定要失败的仗。他表示支持所有为自由和独立而战的国家。
    阿尔及利亚全国革命委员会委员马兹胡迪在会上说：“我们一直在光荣地同帝国主义斗争，我们将继续同他们斗争，直到他们滚出我们的国家为止。”他谴责法国帝国主义对阿尔及利亚人民干下的暴行。
    阿拉伯联合共和国亚非团结委员会主席毛希丁在演说中回述了第二次世界大战结束以来亚洲、中东和阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义、争取独立的斗争。他指出，帝国主义在这些地区中的阴谋都遭到了失败，巴格达条约成了一个没有巴格达的条约。
    他说，由于受帝国主义剥削的地区缩小了、帝国主义总危机加剧了，帝国主义的剥削变得更加凶狠了。在富饶的非洲大陆上，帝国主义也会对民族主义运动采取分而治之的老手法。毛希丁强调亚非人民的合作，他说，这是非洲民族主义运动胜利的必要条件。
    毛希丁说，“亚非人民的责任是继续进行斗争，把帝国主义赶出非洲，解放这个未开发的、富饶的大陆，这样，非洲将属于人民和成为自由与和平的堡垒”。
    喀麦隆代表、喀麦隆人民联盟盟员阿法纳和亚非人民团结理事会书记处的印度代表马拉维亚也在会上讲了话。
    西巴伊最后在会上发言时说，自从举行万隆、开罗和阿克拉会议以来，亚非团结运动在反对帝国主义的斗争中不断地在高涨。他还说，只要亚非人民团结一致，他们就会得到胜利。
    新华社新德里2日电  印度首都新德里公众今天举行了“帝国主义滚出非洲日”群众大会。会上讲话的人一致猛烈谴责帝国主义，要求“不准干涉非洲”。这次大会是由印度亚非团结委员会组成的。
    大会在欢呼声中一致通过决议，保证支持正在为争取自由而斗争的非洲人民。决议表示希望即将在阿克拉举行的全非洲人民会议将成为非洲人民争取自由的斗争中的另一个里程碑。
    大会要求“给予所有的非洲国家以完全的独立”，并且要求“立即释放一切政治犯，结束帝国主义者对人民的残酷的压迫和镇压”。
    大会要求“撤出一切外国军队，取消非洲土地上的外国军事基地”。大会愤怒地谴责法国政府计划在撒哈拉进行核试验。
    大会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人在大会上要求帝国主义从非洲滚出去。她说，亚洲各国人民将援助非洲人民，直到他们取得独立为止。她指出，只有在全世界各地奴役现象绝迹的时候，我们自己的自由才会有保障。
    加纳驻印度高级专员厄尔祖阿赫在讲话中指出，今天非洲有一股要求摆脱帝国主义束缚的巨大潮流和强烈愿望，帝国主义者决不能长期窒息这种愿望了。
    苏丹驻印度公使拉欣塔拉·阿卜杜拉指出，非洲实现自由——生活的自由和合作的自由是符合苏丹和世界和平的利益的。
    埃塞俄比亚驻印度大使伊姆鲁要求巩固亚非国家的团结。他说，我们只有通过努力工作才能获得非洲的独立。
    阿拉伯联合共和国驻印度大使馆临时代办萨拉赫·阿卜德在讲话中指出，无论在道义上、法律上、历史上、经济上和政治上，帝国主义的灭亡的命运都已经注定了。他说，阿拉伯人民将献身于解放非洲的崇高任务。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表谢里夫·格拉勒在会上谴责美国和北大西洋公约组织，因为它们正在帮助所有的殖民国家保持它们的殖民地。
    参加这次大会的有各阶层人民，包括许多国会议员。中国驻印度大使潘自力，以及苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古和越南民主共和国的外交代表和许多在德里学习的非洲学生也参加了这次大会。
    12月1日，在斋浦尔和拉贾斯坦也举行了大会，表示声援非洲人民的斗争。在本星期内，印度的许多其他地方也将举行大会表示支援非洲人民。
    新华社开罗2日电  阿拉伯联合共和国教育部长卡迈勒丁·侯赛因1日晚上在为“帝国主义滚出非洲日”而发表的广播演讲中说，现在是时候了，应当铲除帝国主义，以便使人民能够获得自由和平等。
    这位部长说，各国人民要求帝国主义者滚出他们的国家的激烈呼声正在爆炸开来，在帝国主义者脚下挖下深坑，使他们无可避免地摔得粉身碎骨。
    他又说，滚出非洲是今天的呼声，在非洲人民取得自由和独立以前，它也是每一天的呼声。
    这位部长说，由于亚非国家拥有潜在能力和资源，帝国主义者正在掠夺这些国家，但是亚非人民是能够用自己的潜在能力和资源来保护他们的国家的。他号召青年们担负起为没有帝国主义、剥削和侵略的新前途而斗争的任务。
