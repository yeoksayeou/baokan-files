    Want to know the truth about "Doctor Zhivago"...
    Up to now, Western news agencies have continued to tout the reactionary writer Pasternak, talking about publishing his "autobiography" and the like. His "Doctor Zhivago" is a novel that has won the applause of Dulles and others. Since the reactionaries attach so much importance to it, we may as well have a general understanding of its content, so as to understand why the enemy likes it, and understand some of the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeois intellectuals and their expression in literature. Bad things can also be turned into good things.
    However, the criticisms in many newspapers and periodicals are relatively simple and do not introduce much about the content of this book. The "Translations" monthly, published this month, has translated and published the long letter from the editorial department of "New World" magazine to Pasternak, which contains detailed analysis and sharp criticism of the content of the book, and is worth reading.
    The letter quoted an entire chapter of the novel, which describes how Dr. Zhivago, who was forced to serve in the Red Army guerrillas, sympathized with the White Army, even caring for a wounded White Army soldier who was not dead, and then telling him to pose as a Red Army soldier and letting him return to Kolchak's troops. The novelist tried his best to defend the reactionary behavior and thoughts of this military doctor.
    It can be described as a wonderful and amazing article. The novel promotes a completely counter-revolutionary and traitorous philosophy. No wonder the Soviet writer Zaslavsky called Pasternak a "fugitive at home."

    欲知“日瓦戈医生”真相……
    直到目前为止，西方通讯社还在继续不断地吹捧反动作家帕斯捷尔纳克，什么要出版他的“自传”之类。他的“日瓦戈医生”是一本赢得杜勒斯等人叫好的小说。既然反动派如此重视它，我们也不妨大致了解一下它的内容，以便懂得敌人为什么喜欢它，懂得资产阶级知识分子的一些反动思想，及其在文学中的表现。坏事也可以变成好事。
    但是，许多报刊上的批判比较简单，对这书内容介绍不多。本月出版的“译文”月刊译载了“新世界”杂志编辑部给帕斯捷尔纳克的长信，对书的内容有详细的分析和尖锐的批判，值得一读。
    信中引用了小说的整个一章，其中描写被迫在红军游击队中服役的日瓦戈医生怎样同情白军，甚至把一个受伤未死的白军加以护理，然后叫他冒充红军，放他回高尔察克的部队去。小说作者竭力为这个军医的反动行为和思想辩护。
    真可谓是叹观止矣的奇文。小说宣扬的完全是反革命叛徒的哲学。无怪苏联作家萨斯拉夫斯基称帕斯捷尔纳克为“国内的亡命之徒”。
