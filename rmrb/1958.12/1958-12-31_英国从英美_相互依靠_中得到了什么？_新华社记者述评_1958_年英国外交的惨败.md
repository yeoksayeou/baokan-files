What Has Britain Gained from Anglo-American "Mutual Reliance"?
—Xinhua News Agency Reporter's Commentary on the Tragic Failure of British Diplomacy in 1958

1958 was a year of tremendous failure for British diplomacy.

In the international situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, the United States' stubborn actions to oppose socialist countries and national independence movements have suffered great failures this year. Its "mutually reliant" partner, Britain, has only seen its international status further greatly reduced. The United States is continuing to nibble away at the remaining positions of the British Empire piece by piece. The imminent implementation of the Western European "Common Market" and the failure of Britain's designed "Free Trade Area" plan mark an unprecedentedly heavy blow to Britain's policy of relying on the United States and attempting to dominate Western Europe by using the contradictions between France and West Germany after World War II.

Many of Britain's diplomatic failures this year are linked to the so-called principle of Anglo-American "mutual reliance." British Prime Minister Macmillan said in September that "now, the strength of the Anglo-American alliance has been strengthened to a degree of trust and friendship that has never been seen before." U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also said in October that "there has never been such close cooperation (between the U.S. and Britain) as exists today." However, what exactly is the picture hidden behind all these sweet words?

Professing "Mutual Reliance,"
	In Reality, Each Has Their Own Plans

The United States and Britain are the first and second largest countries in the imperialist camp. Their "mutual reliance" is to counter the superiority of socialist countries and the great wave of national independence movements. However, they each have their own plans, trying their best to maintain and expand their respective spheres of control. The current situation is that the socialist camp cannot be touched by imperialism, and the entire imperialist sphere of control is shrinking day by day. Imperialism is falling into a political and economic crisis that is rotting away day by day. Under these circumstances, the United States, Britain, and other imperialist countries are increasingly frantically attempting to save their respective crises at the expense of others. The Anglo-American alliance is precisely built on the basis of such conflicting dreams, mutual exploitation to weaken each other.

The formation process of the current Anglo-American "unprecedentedly close mutual reliance" touted by Macmillan and Dulles also clearly illustrates this point. As early as after the disastrous defeat of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt in 1956, the current Macmillan government of Britain came to power in early 1957 and begged for "U.S.-British cooperation" to maintain British colonial power in the Middle East. At that time, the United States was extremely arrogant, clamoring that Britain should admit that it "has declined and is no longer a great power," and that "U.S. power should fill the weakening of British power," etc. By the second half of 1957, the Soviet satellite went into space, and the United States' "leadership prestige" in the Western world was greatly shaken. The United States urgently needed helpers to stabilize the entire imperialist camp. Macmillan rushed to Washington at this time and drew up the so-called "blueprint for mutual reliance" with Eisenhower, rebuilding the "two-headed core of the U.S. and Britain." Since this year, the United States has been embarrassed in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait, and the domestic economic crisis in the United States has further deteriorated. Britain sees that the United States needs it and is more urgently seeking to "rely" on U.S. "aid" to strengthen the competitiveness of the British economy, build Britain into a "major nuclear armament power," and support the increasingly disintegrating colonial empire. Not long ago, the British ruling group was still further dreaming of going from being a big helper of the United States to dividing the leadership of the Western world equally with the United States. British Marshal Montgomery's speech in London on October 24 was very eye-catching. In his speech, Montgomery attacked the United States' diplomatic policy leadership as incompetent and advocated that the West "needs British leadership," and advocated that the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization must be reorganized. Of course, this is only the subjective wish of British imperialism. The United States is absolutely unwilling for Britain to truly reorganize. After Montgomery's remarks, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Army, the American Norstad, came out to criticize this opinion as "rash and frivolous."

The United States Steps Up Its Advance,
	Britain Retreats Repeatedly

The United States has always used the Anglo-American alliance to nibble away at the British Empire. The deeper the Anglo-American "mutual reliance," the more intense the contradictions between the two countries actually are. Every compromise and "cooperation" between the U.S. and Britain is essentially a preparation for the next round of competition for each other's interests. In recent years, although Britain has tried its best to resist and counterattack, the United States has actually caused Britain to retreat repeatedly by using its "strength status" over Britain. Britain's policy of Anglo-American "mutual reliance" is inviting a wolf into the house and inviting failure upon itself.

Let's look at some of the main facts this year:

After the successful revolution in Iraq, Britain followed the United States in sending troops to Jordan. Britain, which was in a mess after "going it alone" in the invasion of Egypt, this time fully wanted to use the United States to take the lead in restoring Britain's colonial position in the Middle East. Macmillan said before the British troops were dispatched, "It is better to do the wrong thing together than to do the right thing alone." However, the result was that both the U.S. and Britain completely failed. Britain tried its best to at least control the territory of Jordan through this intervention, but before and after the British army withdrew from Jordan, the United States gave Jordan a lot of "aid" and weapons, sent military delegations to Jordan to carry out extensive activities, and the U.S. chargé d'affaires openly attended Jordanian cabinet meetings, trying its best to bring Jordan back into its pocket. The United States is also negotiating with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, the remaining members of the Baghdad Pact, to sign bilateral military agreements, which will actually form a "northern tier" completely controlled by the United States, pushing out the influence of Britain, which originally organized the Baghdad Pact.

Britain's current sphere of colonial influence in the Middle East mainly remains only a line of emirates in the Persian Gulf such as Kuwait and Oman and Aden in the southern Arabian Peninsula, but even in these areas, the rise of the national independence movement makes Britain feel unable to suppress it alone. The U.S. and Britain have secretly agreed to conduct "joint defense" in the Persian Gulf. Naturally, the United States will demand that Britain hand over more Persian Gulf oil fields as the price. Not long ago, Britain increased its troops to the Persian Gulf, and the United States is also stepping up the construction of naval and missile bases in Iran. Behind the black flag of jointly suppressing the national independence movement in the Middle East, a struggle for the United States to seize Britain's remaining oil interests is unfolding.

This year, when the United States carried out military provocations in the Taiwan Strait, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd acted as Dulles' echo in Parliament and the United Nations General Assembly. Recently, the British government has been actively assisting the United States in promoting the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." The Chinese people have repeatedly warned that the British government will only suffer if they do so. From the news in the American newspapers, it can be seen that Britain is trying hard to please the United States in its policy towards China in order to exchange for the United States' "support," especially for the United States to "cooperate" in maintaining Britain's colonial interests in Southeast Asia. Britain has turned Hong Kong into a distribution center for the U.S. military, and Singapore, Britain's main strategic base in Southeast Asia, is also open to the U.S. military. The United States is taking the opportunity to expand its own influence. Following the landing of 2,000 U.S. Marines in Singapore in August this year, the U.S. authorities revealed that they would establish a Fifth Fleet in the Indian Ocean, which Britain is trying to control. At the end of November this year, Britain, which was in a difficult situation militarily, specially drew out an aircraft carrier and a heavy cruiser and sent them to Singapore to strengthen the Far East Fleet. This is not without a guard against the Americans.

The "Colombo Plan" was originally a tool for Britain to maintain and expand its economic influence in some Asian countries, but Britain, which is extremely tight on economic resources, has always wanted to use U.S. investment to support this plan. This year, ministers from the "Colombo Plan" member states went to the United States for a meeting for the first time, and the United States sent a signal to further seize the leadership of this plan.

Western European Contradictions Intensify,
	Britain is in an Unfavorable Situation

In Western Europe, Britain originally wanted to act as the United States' "sheepdog guarding the European flock" after the establishment of the "two-headed core" between the U.S. and Britain in the second half of last year. This was strongly opposed by Western European continental countries. In recent years, the Anglo-French alliance has actually tended to break down. People still remember that after the failure of the joint Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the British Queen and Prime Minister visited France one after another in the first half of last year, talking about "Anglo-French friendship." However, after the formation of the U.S.-British "core" in the second half of last year, Britain immediately turned its face and secretly agreed with the United States to divide France's colonial interests in North Africa. Last year and this year, the U.S. and Britain jointly transported arms to Tunisia and "mediated" the incident, arousing great resentment from the French ruling group. After de Gaulle came to power, he adopted a policy of uniting Germany (West) to resist Britain. The French rulers attempted to use the economic power of West Germany to maintain the French economy, which was full of holes, develop nuclear weapons, so that France could squeeze into the U.S.-British "atomic club," and unite with West Germany to maintain France's colonial positions in Africa. France, West Germany, and Italy have already formed a three-nation axis in the development of nuclear weapons and other aspects. The "Common Market" formed by these countries regardless of British opposition will be implemented on January 1, next year, and Britain's "Free Trade Area" plan, which has been carefully planned for more than two years, has failed. On December 27, Britain, France, West Germany, and others announced the limited free exchange of currencies, and a white-hot trade and economic war between Britain and Western European continental countries has begun.

Of course, in Western Europe, de Gaulle's France's attempt to make a comeback is not the biggest threat to Britain. The biggest threat is West Germany, which is competing with Britain for the status of "second largest country" in the Western world. West Germany has surpassed Britain in most items of industrial production and industrial product exports. The new Nazi nuclear armed forces that are being established will also become a strong enemy of Britain militarily. Britain, which has a tradition of playing the "balance of power" policy in continental Europe, has been trying to win over France and expand the traditional contradictions between France and West Germany to suppress West Germany for many years. However, Britain's "balance of power" policy has suffered a serious setback. France has already fallen into the axis led by West Germany. After Britain recently had a big quarrel with France on the "Common Market" issue, it not only expects the United States, but also expects West Germany to come out to "mediate." West Germany is forming a hegemony over continental Western Europe, and Britain's Western European hegemony, which it attempted to establish by using Anglo-American "mutual reliance," has been completely shaken.

The United States is reaping the benefits from the infighting of Western European imperialist countries. The United States has been supporting the forces of West German militarism after the war, and U.S. capital already has considerable influence in the West German economy. It supports the establishment of the "Common Market" in order to expand U.S. economic influence. Although there is also another aspect of the U.S. policy to unite Britain to contain West Germany, it is very obvious that the new combination of Western European imperialist countries is very beneficial to the United States to further weaken Britain.

Some of the results of Britain's implementation of the Anglo-American "mutual reliance" foreign policy over the past year are: the widespread establishment of U.S. air force and missile bases in Britain, and the British people living every day under the "deterrent flight" of U.S. aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs; the remnants of the British Empire are attacked everywhere by U.S. "allies"; Britain is extremely isolated in Western Europe; Britain's status as the "second largest country" in the Western world is being threatened by West Germany's aggressive threat. At the end of 1958, this is a bleak picture of the declining British Empire. (Attached picture)

    英国从英美“相互依靠”中得到了什么？
    ——新华社记者述评1958年英国外交的惨败
    1958年，是英国外交遭到惨重失败的一年。
    在东风压倒西风的国际形势下，今年里，美国顽固敌视社会主义国家和民族独立运动的行动，遭到了大失败，它的“相互依靠”者——英国所落得的，也就是国际地位进一步大大降低。美国在继续一片片地蚕食大英帝国残留的阵地。西欧“共同市场”行将实施，英国设计的“自由贸易区”计划破灭，这些都标志着英国在第二次世界大战后依靠美国、企图运用法国和西德矛盾以称霸西欧的政策，遭到了空前沉重的打击。
    英国外交今年许多方面的失败，都是同所谓英美“相互依靠”的原则联系着的。英国首相麦克米伦在9月间说，“现在，英美联盟的力量又加强到从未有过的信任和友好的程度”。美国国务卿杜勒斯也在10月间说，“从来没有过目前存在的这种（美英两国）密切合作”。但是，藏在这种种甜言蜜语背后的，究竟是一幅什么图景呢？
    口称“相互依靠”
          实则各有打算
    美英是帝国主义阵营第一、第二两个大国，它们“相互依靠”，是为了对抗社会主义国家优势和民族独立运动巨浪。但是，它们各自又有各自的打算，想尽力保持和扩大各自的统治地盘。当前局面是，社会主义阵营是帝国主义所碰不动的，整个帝国主义统治地盘在一天天缩小，帝国主义陷入一天天烂下去的政治和经济危机中，在这种情况下，美英以及其他帝国主义国家相互之间都一天天地在更加狂热地企图以牺牲别人来挽救各自的危机。美英联盟正是建立在这种同床异梦、相互利用以谋削弱对方的基础上的。
    麦克米伦和杜勒斯所吹嘘的当前美英“空前密切相互依靠”的形成过程，也清楚地说明了这一点。还在1956年英法侵略埃及战争惨败以后，英国目前的麦克米伦政府在1957年年初上台，就乞求“美英合作”来维持英国在中东的殖民势力。当时，美国气焰极高，大肆叫嚷英国应该承认它“已经衰落得不再是大国了”，应该由“美国力量来填补英国力量的削弱”等等。到1957年下半年，苏联卫星上了天，美国在西方世界的“领导威信”大大动摇，美国亟需帮手来稳住整个帝国主义阵营，麦克米伦就在这时赶去华盛顿，同艾森豪威尔拟订了所谓“相互依靠的蓝图”，重建起“美英两巨头核心”。今年以来，美国在中东和台湾海峡先后出丑，美国国内经济危机进一步恶化，英国看到美国需要它，更亟谋“依靠”美国“援助”，来加强英国经济的竞争能力，把英国建成“核军备大国”，支撑住日趋瓦解的殖民帝国。不久前，英国统治集团还在进一步作着美梦，想由目前充当美国大伙计进而同美国平分西方世界的领导权。英国元帅蒙哥马利10月24日在伦敦发表的一篇演说就十分受人注目。蒙哥马利在演说中大肆攻击美国外交政策领导无能，鼓吹西方“需要英国的领导”，并且鼓吹必须改组以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织。当然，这只是英帝国主义者一面的主观愿望。美国是绝不愿英国真正重整旗鼓的。在蒙哥马利一席谈后，北大西洋集团军总司令、美国的诺斯塔德出来斥责这种意见是“轻率和轻浮的”。
    美国步步进逼
          英国节节败北
    美国一直是利用美英联盟，来蚕食大英帝国。美英“相互依靠”越深，实际上两国间的矛盾愈激烈。美英双方每次妥协和“合作”，实质上都是为了替下一步争夺对方利益作准备。今年来，尽管英国竭力在抵抗和反攻，但是美国利用它对英国的“实力地位”，实际上在使得英国节节败北。英国奉行的英美“相互依靠”政策，是引狼入室，自招失败。
    且看今年的一些主要事实：
    在伊拉克革命成功后，英国尾随美国出兵约旦。在侵埃战争中因“单干”弄得焦头烂额的英国，这次满想以美国打头阵，来恢复英国在中东的殖民地位。麦克米伦在英国出兵前说，
  “一起干错误的事情，要比单干正确的事情好。”但是，结果是英美双双完全失败。英国竭力想经过这次干涉至少控制住约旦这块地盘，但是在英军撤出约旦前后，美国便给约旦大量“援助”和武器，派遣军事代表团到约旦大肆活动，美国代办也公然出席约旦内阁会议，尽力要把约旦重新抓入它的囊中。美国还正在同巴格达条约残余成员国土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦谈判签订双边军事协定，这样实际上将形成完全由美国控制的“北层”，而把原先筹组巴格达条约的英国的势力排挤出去。
    英国目前在中东的殖民势力范围主要已只剩波斯湾酋长国科威特等及阿拉伯半岛南部阿曼、亚丁等地一线，但是即使在这些地区，民族独立运动的高涨也使得英国感到无力独自镇压，英美已秘密协议要在波斯湾进行“联防”。自然，美国要以英国交出更多波斯湾油田作为代价。不久前英国增兵波斯湾，美国也正在伊朗加紧建筑海军和导弹基地，在联合镇压中东民族独立运动的黑旗后面，一场美国抢占英国残存石油权益的斗争正在展开。
    今年当美国在台湾海峡进行军事挑衅时，英国外交大臣劳埃德在议会和联合国大会上充当杜勒斯的应声虫。而最近以来，英国政府更在积极协助美国推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋。中国人民已经一再警告，英国政府这样做只会使他们自己吃苦头。从美国报刊的消息里可以看到，英国在对中国政策上卖劲讨好美国，是想换取美国对英国的“支持”，特别是要美国来“合作”维护英国在东南亚的殖民利益。英国把香港变为美国军队的集散地，英国在东南亚的主要战略据点新加坡也向美国军队开放。而美国则乘机来扩张它自己的势力。继今年8月美国两千名海军陆战队在新加坡登陆后，美国当局就透露出来将在英国力图控制的印度洋里建立第五舰队。今年11月底，在军事上到处捉襟见肘的英国，还特别抽出一艘航空母舰和一艘重型巡洋舰，开到新加坡来增强远东舰队，这未尝不是对美国佬的一种戒备。
    “科伦坡计划”原是英国保持和扩大它在一些亚洲国家的经济势力的工具，但是经济上拮据异常的英国一直是要利用美国投资来支持这个计划的。今年里，“科伦坡计划”成员国部长们第一次齐去美国开会，美国发出了进一步夺取这个计划领导权的信号。
      西欧矛盾加剧
          英国处境不利
    在西欧，英美去年下半年成立“两巨头核心”，英国本是要充当美国“看守欧洲羊群的牧羊犬”。这遭到了西欧大陆国家的强烈反对。今年来，特别是英法同盟实际趋于破裂。人们当还记得，在英法联合侵埃战争失败后，去年上半年里，英国女王和首相还接连访法，大谈过“英法友好”的。但是，去年下半年，美英“核心”形成后，英国立即反过脸来，同美国密约瓜分法国在北非的殖民利益。去年和今年，美英联合向突尼斯输送军火和“斡旋”事件，激起法国统治集团极大反感。戴高乐上台后，采取了联德（西）抗英的政策。法国统治者企图利用西德经济力量来维持千孔百疮的法国经济，发展核武器，使法国能挤进美英“原子俱乐部”里去，并且联合西德来保持法国在非洲的殖民阵地。法国、西德和意大利已经在发展核武器等方面形成了三国轴心。这些国家联合起来的“共同市场”不顾英国反对而即将在明年1月1日实施，英国苦心策划了两年多的“自由贸易区”计划落了空。12月27日，英国、法国、西德等宣布货币有限度自由兑换，英国同西欧大陆国家间一场白热的贸易经济战已经开锣。
    当然，在西欧，戴高乐的法国企图东山再起还不是对英国的最大威胁。最大威胁是西德，它正在同英国争夺着西方世界“第二大国”地位。西德在工业生产大多数项目以及工业品输出上已经超过英国。正在建立中的新纳粹核武装军队，也将在军事上成为英国的劲敌。有着在欧洲大陆玩弄“均势”政策传统的英国，多年来一直是企图拉拢法国，扩大法国和西德间的传统矛盾，来压制西德的。但是，英国这种“均势”政策遭到了严重挫折。法国已经落入西德领导的轴心里。英国最近在“共同市场”问题上同法国大吵大闹后，不仅指望美国、也指望西德出来“调停”。西德正在形成对西欧大陆的霸权，而英国企图利用英美“相互依靠”来建立的西欧霸权已经彻底动摇。
    美国从西欧帝国主义国家的火并中，坐收渔利。美国战后一直是扶植西德军国主义势力的，美国资本也已在西德经济中有相当势力，它是支持成立“共同市场”，以便于扩张美国经济势力的。美国政策里虽也另有着联合英国牵制西德的一面，但是，很明显，目前西欧帝国主义国家的新组合，对美国进一步削弱英国是十分有利的。
    一年来英国执行英美“相互依靠”的外交政策的一些结果是：英国本土遍设美国空军和导弹基地，英国人民天天生活在载着氢弹的美国飞机的“威慑飞行”下；英帝国主义的残余地盘处处都有美国“盟友”来袭击；英国在西欧异常孤立；英国作为西方世界“第二大国”的地位，正受到西德咄咄逼人的威胁。在1958年年关之际，这便是没落的大英帝国的一幅凄凉图景。（附图片）
