    Shandong's Lintian Diagnosis Cures Yellowing Disease
    Sufficient Fertilizer Eliminates Third-Class Seedlings

    (Our dispatch) Shandong Province has found good methods to eliminate the phenomena of wheat seedlings yellowing, having dry tips, and growing wildly. Now, the people's communes in this province are adopting management methods that focus on both ends to drive the middle, aiming at the different growth conditions of wheat seedlings. They are promoting the normal growth of high-yield fields, forcing third-class seedlings to upgrade in blocks, and striving for an overall bumper harvest.

    This year, Shandong Province planted 65 million mu of wheat. Due to good planting and management, the wheat is generally growing vigorously. However, in many wheat fields, wheat seedlings are yellowing and have dry tips in patches; some satellite fields' wheat seedlings are experiencing rapid and wild growth. Recently, various localities have conducted serious investigations and studies on these abnormal development situations. After field observation, it has been proven that the reason for the yellowing and dry tips of wheat seedlings is: first, there was not enough base fertilizer applied during the rush planting, so the seedlings did not have enough "food"; second, although more base fertilizer was applied, it was not evenly distributed or it was applied too deep. While the roots of wheat are not yet well developed, they cannot make use of it; third, the plowing technique was not well mastered, resulting in too much raw soil on the surface, and without careful harrowing and raking, causing the soil to lose moisture, affecting the absorption of water and nutrients by wheat. The wildly growing wheat, according to investigations, is mostly because the land was plowed deeply, a lot of fertilizer was applied, and topdressing and watering after planting were more frequent than in ordinary wheat fields. Coupled with the warm weather this year, this has resulted in rapid growth. When various localities studied and analyzed the causes of weak and wildly growing seedlings, they also made active and bold explorations for remedies. The methods researched and developed by various localities through observation and comparison are: for weak seedlings (i.e., wheat seedlings that are yellowing and have dry tips), quick-acting fertilizers containing more nitrogen should be applied, such as urea and diluted human manure, and water should be applied and compaction done quickly. For wildly growing seedlings, temporarily stop watering, compact the soil as soon as possible, and apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to increase stem hardness and control excessive growth.

    Now, the wheat field management movement in Shandong Province, which focuses on high-yield wheat fields and forces the upgrading of third-class wheat seedlings, has entered a deep and sustained climax stage. Many areas have comprehensively classified, arranged, and marked wheat fields, implementing a layer-by-layer contracted management system with designated personnel responsible.

    The Shandong Provincial Party Committee, in view of the fact that wheat field management has entered an in-depth stage, once again issued a mobilization order to the entire party in Shandong, requiring all localities to apply all existing fertilizers to wheat fields before the freeze, with each mu receiving 30,000 to 50,000 jin of fertilizer, ensuring that every mu is fertilized and no piece of land is missed, completely eliminating third-class seedlings. In conjunction with topdressing, a thorough watering before freezing should be carried out.

    山东  临田诊断，治好发黄病
    喂足肥料，消灭三类苗
    本报讯  如何消除麦苗发黄、干尖和疯长的现象，在山东省已经找到了好办法。现在这个省的人民公社正针对麦苗生长的不同情况，采取抓两头带中间的管理方法，促进丰产田正常生长，迫使三类苗块块升级，力争全面大丰收。
    山东省今年种植的六千五百多万亩小麦，由于种的好、管的好，现在一般都生长旺盛。但是，也有不少麦田的麦苗成片成块的发黄、干尖；有些卫星田的麦苗，还发生猛长、疯长现象，最近各地对这种不正常的发育情况进行了认真地调查研究。经过实地观察证明，麦苗所以发黄、干尖，一是在抢种时没有来得及施足底肥，没有“饱饭吃”；二是基肥施的虽然较多，但不均匀或者施的过深，在小麦根部还不太发达的时候，一时使不上劲；三是翻地技术掌握的不好，表层生土过多，加上又没有经过精细的耙耢，造成土地透风跑墒，影响小麦吸收水分和养分。疯长的小麦，据调查大都因为地翻得深，施肥多，种后追肥、浇水也都比一般麦田多，遇到今年天气暖和，所以形成猛长。各地在研究分析弱苗和疯苗的原因时，对补救这些麦苗的办法，也作了积极大胆的探索。各地通过观察对比研究出的办法是：对弱苗（即发黄、干尖的麦苗）应追施含氮素较多的速效肥，如尿素、人粪稀，并迅速浇水和镇压。对疯长苗则采用暂时停止浇水，尽快镇压，追施磷、钾肥料以增加秆硬，控制高长。
    现在，山东省大抓小麦高额丰产田，迫使三类麦苗升级的麦田管理运动，已经进入深入持久的高潮阶段。许多地区对麦田进行了全面分类排队和插标，实行了层层分片包干专人负责管理的办法。
    中共山东省委鉴于麦田管理已进入深入阶段，再次向山东全党发出动员令，要求各地在封冻前，将现有的肥料全部追到麦田里，每亩追肥要达到三万斤到五万斤，保证亩亩追肥，不漏掉一块地，彻底消灭三类苗。并要结合追肥，普浇一次冻水。
