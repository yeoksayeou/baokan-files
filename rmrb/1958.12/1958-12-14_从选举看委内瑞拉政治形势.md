From the election to see the Venezuelan political situation
　　Zhang Ye
　　Venezuela held elections for the President of the Republic, members of the National Assembly, and members of the state legislative assemblies and city councils on December 7. This was the first democratic and free election held by the Venezuelan people after overthrowing the ten-year dictatorship of Jiménez. According to the Venezuelan Supreme Electoral Council, among the three presidential candidates, Rómulo Betancourt, chairman of the largest bourgeois party, Democratic Action, received the most votes and was elected as the new president. As everyone knows, from January 21 to 23 this year, the Venezuelan people, under the leadership of the underground national united front organization "Patriotic Committee" (with representatives from Democratic Action, the Republican Democratic Union, the Communist Party, and the Christian Social Party), overthrew the Jiménez dictatorship through unprecedented large-scale demonstrations and strikes, creating favorable conditions for the country's democratic development and national independence.
　　After the Jiménez dictatorship was overthrown, a military government council headed by Rear Admiral Larrázabal took power. In the powerful people's movement and in the struggles to repel the counterattacks of domestic and foreign enemies, this government increasingly showed patriotic and democratic tendencies, and during its tenure, it took some measures beneficial to the people and national interests. For example, in the political field: releasing political prisoners, recalling political exiles, preparing for general elections, restoring democratic freedoms and restoring the legal status of Democratic Action, the Communist Party, etc., which were declared illegal by the Jiménez regime, dissolving the secret police, confiscating Jiménez's property, and requesting the US government to extradite Jiménez; in terms of economic policy: rejecting the US's two hundred million dollar loan with harsh conditions, and deciding to build a steel plant with an annual output of 1.6 million tons regardless of US obstruction; in foreign policy: announcing its intention to pursue a foreign policy that conforms to national interests, and striving to develop trade relations with Latin American countries.
　　Venezuela is the second largest oil producer and the largest oil exporter in the capitalist world, and it has abundant iron ore reserves. The United States has three billion US dollars invested in this country. American companies have plundered more than 70% of Venezuela's oil and most of its iron ore. The Jiménez dictatorship was actually a tool for American monopoly capital to control Venezuela. The downfall of Jiménez and the new political developments in Venezuela signify the victory of the Venezuelan people and the failure of US imperialism and its agents in Venezuela.
　　US imperialism and its agents in Venezuela are unwilling to accept this failure. They collude and try every means to prevent Venezuela from moving forward. Therefore, after Jiménez was overthrown, there has been a sharp struggle between the patriotic democratic forces and the reactionary forces supported by the United States in Venezuela. Thanks to the unity of the Venezuelan people and the unity of the military and civilians, especially thanks to the resolute struggle of the Venezuelan working class to defend democratic freedom and national independence, the three reactionary coup attempts instigated by the United States on July 22-23, September 7, and November 15 were crushed.
　　In addition to launching coups to carry out subversion activities, the enemies of the Venezuelan people also tried their best to obstruct and sabotage the scheduled elections. Several reactionary coups had the purpose of undermining the elections. The reactionary ultimatum issued by Castro León, the leader of the July 22-23 reactionary coup, to the military government council included a demand to postpone the date of the general election. Therefore, the holding of the general election on December 7 as scheduled and the fact that the election conformed to the principles of democracy and justice is a victory for the Venezuelan patriotic democratic forces over domestic and foreign reactionary forces, and it is also a result of the Venezuelan people's struggle to safeguard democracy.
　　The Venezuelan election campaign began in mid-November. In addition to the four member parties of the "Patriotic Committee," Democratic Action, the Republican Democratic Union, the Communist Party, and the Christian Social Party, four smaller parties also participated in this election: the Republican Alliance Party, the Venezuelan Socialist Party, the Socialist Workers' Party, and the Revolutionary Republican Independent Electoral Front, a local party in the state of Lara. The four parties participating in the "Patriotic Committee" held a "round table conference" on the election issue in October this year and reached a principled agreement on proposing a common national united presidential candidate. The Venezuelan Communist Party has unswervingly struggled to realize this agreement. The Communist Party believes that a non-partisan united candidate will help strengthen national unity and establish a coalition government including national democratic forces, thereby ensuring the fruits of electoral victory and the stability of the government, and having the strength to crush the frantic attacks that domestic and foreign reactionary forces will inevitably launch against this popularly elected government. However, later, due to disagreements among Democratic Action, the Christian Social Party, and the Republican Democratic Union on the issue of candidate nominations, they agreed that each party would nominate its own candidate separately. In order to avoid deepening the split, the Venezuelan Communist Party did not nominate its own candidate, announced its support for Larrázabal, the candidate nominated by the Republican Democratic Union, and advocated the establishment of a national alliance government including all parties, military republican factions, and non-partisans after the election. The Communist Party supported Larrázabal because he showed democratic tendencies during his tenure as chairman of the military government council. If he were elected president, he would be able to better guarantee national unity and the democratic system, and be able to guarantee the unity of political figures and military figures, so that the new government would be stable.
　　Although the nomination of three presidential candidates in Venezuela was a negative factor in terms of national unity, Democratic Action, the Republican Democratic Union, and the Christian Social Party signed an agreement on October 31, guaranteeing the defense of constitutional government through a national united government with a minimum program, and defending the power to govern based on the results of the December 7 election.
　　The Communist Party believes that the protection of constitutional government and the power to govern based on the election results, the establishment of a national united coalition government, the formulation of a common minimum program, the implementation of a political truce, and the support for the election results in the agreement were the positive aspects of this agreement and expressed its support. However, since the agreement agreed that each party would nominate its own candidates, which was a negative aspect, the Communist Party did not sign the agreement.
　　President-elect Betancourt's Democratic Action is one of the largest bourgeois parties in Venezuela, representing the interests of the national bourgeoisie, and enjoying prestige among the petty bourgeoisie and even some of the working people. Betancourt put forward a bourgeois democratic reform campaign program, advocating restricting the activities of American oil monopoly capital, respecting democratic freedoms, implementing land reform, and developing independent national industries. After being elected president, Betancourt announced the program of the new government to some journalists on December 10. He said that he would guarantee respect for democratic freedoms, especially freedom of the press; the government would no longer give foreign oil companies more concessions, and would establish a national oil company, so that the exploitation of underground resources would benefit Venezuela; the government would revise oil privileges to obtain crude oil for trade with other countries; the government would encourage foreign immigration and implement a huge public works program to solve the extremely serious problem of five hundred thousand unemployed people. Betancourt's campaign program and government program are basically in line with the wishes of the Venezuelan people, but the Democratic Action he represents still has a certain degree of illusion about the United States. Betancourt expressed his hope to get the support of the "powerful free class" in the United States and the support of the American trade union movement. In addition, it opposes the participation of Communists in the new government after the election.
　　The Venezuelan people have greatly raised their awareness in the long anti-dictatorial struggle and the arduous struggle to crush the subversive activities of domestic and foreign reactionaries in the past year, and strongly demand national unity and the establishment of a government that ensures democratic freedom and national independence. The results of this election show that the patriotic democratic forces in Venezuela continue to grow. In addition to the increase in the votes obtained by Democratic Action compared to the past, the Communist Party obtained 9% of the national votes in this election, almost four times the number of votes obtained in the 1948 election; in the capital Caracas, the Communist Party obtained 20% of the total votes; the votes of the Republican Democratic Union have also increased significantly compared to the past. The only ones whose votes have decreased are the right-wing Christian Social Party. This change in the political forces in Venezuela, as shown by the election, shows that the patriotic democratic forces in Venezuela currently occupy the upper hand, which is conducive to guaranteeing the unity, stability, and progress of Venezuela after the election.
　　US imperialism and the reactionaries in Venezuela do not like this election result in Venezuela. In order to undermine this election and subvert the military government council with democratic tendencies, they have carried out many conspiracies. Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until extinction, this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world. US imperialism and its lackeys in Venezuela are also the same. They are bound to make trouble for the new Venezuelan government elected by the people. However, the Venezuelan people, who have ten years of experience in the anti-dictatorial struggle and have demonstrated their unity and strength in the uprisings and anti-coup struggles in January, July, September, and November this year, will be vigilant against all conspiracies carried out by domestic and foreign reactionaries.

    从选举看委内瑞拉政治形势
    章叶
    委内瑞拉于12月7日举行了共和国总统、国民大会议员以及州立法议会和市议会议员的选举。这是委内瑞拉人民在推翻了希门尼斯十年独裁统治之后举行的第一次民主自由选举。据委内瑞拉最高选举委员会公布，在三个总统候选人中间，最大的资产阶级政党民主行动党的主席罗慕洛·贝坦科尔特得票最多，当选为新总统。大家知道，今年1月21—23日，委内瑞拉人民在地下民族统一战线组织“爱国委员会”（参加这个组织的有民主行动党、共和民主联盟、共产党和基督教社会党的代表）的领导下，以空前规模的大游行大罢工的行动，推翻了希门尼斯独裁政权，为国家的民主发展和民族独立创造了有利条件。
    希门尼斯独裁政权被推翻后，以拉腊萨巴耳海军少将为首的军政府委员会掌握了政权。在强大的人民运动和在历次反击国内外敌人的反扑的斗争中，这个政府日益具有爱国民主倾向，在它执政时期，采取了一些有利于人民和民族利益的措施。例如，在政治方面：释放政治犯，召回政治流亡人士，准备普选，恢复民主自由和恢复被希门尼斯政权宣布为非法的民主行动党、共产党等的合法地位，解散秘密警察，没收希门尼斯的财产并向美国政府提出引渡希门尼斯的要求；在经济政策方面：拒绝了附带苛刻条件的、美国的两亿美元贷款，并不顾美国的阻挠决定兴建一座年产一百六十万吨钢的炼钢厂；在外交政策方面：宣布打算奉行符合民族利益的外交政策，并且竭力发展同拉丁美洲各国的贸易关系。
    委内瑞拉是资本主义世界中石油生产占第二位、石油输出占第一位，并蕴藏着丰富铁矿的国家。美国在这个国家里有三十亿美元的投资。美国公司掠夺了委内瑞拉70％以上的石油和大部分铁矿砂。希门尼斯的独裁政权实际上是美国垄断资本控制委内瑞拉的工具。希门尼斯的垮台和委内瑞拉的新的政治动向，意味着委内瑞拉人民的胜利和美帝国主义和它在委内瑞拉的代理人的失败。
    美帝国主义及其在委内瑞拉的代理人是不甘心这种失败的。他们勾结起来，千方百计地想阻挡委内瑞拉的前进。因此，在希门尼斯被推翻以后，委内瑞拉一直存在着爱国民主力量同美国支持的反动力量的尖锐斗争。由于委内瑞拉人民的团结和军民的团结，特别是由于委内瑞拉工人阶级保卫民主自由和民族独立的坚决斗争，粉碎了7月22—23日、9月7日、11月15日三次由美国策动的反动政变阴谋。
    委内瑞拉人民的敌人除了发动政变进行颠复活动以外，还竭力阻挠和破坏预定的选举。几次反动政变都具有破坏选举的目的，7月22至23日反动政变的头子卡斯特罗—莱昂向军政府委员会提出的反动通牒就有要求推迟普选日期一条。因此，12月7日如期举行普选，以及选举符合于民主和公正的原则，这就是委内瑞拉爱国民主力量对国内外反动势力的一个胜利，也是委内瑞拉人民维护民主的斗争的一个成果。
    委内瑞拉的选举活动是从11月中旬开始的。参加这次选举的除了民主行动党、共和民主联盟、共产党和基督教社会党这四个“爱国委员会”的成员政党以外，还有共和联盟党、委内瑞拉社会党、社会主义工人党以及拉拉州的地方性党派革命共和独立选举阵线等四个比较小的党派。参加“爱国委员会”的四个政党曾经在今年10月就选举问题举行过“圆桌会议”，并且达成一项关于提出共同的民族联合总统候选人的原则协议。委内瑞拉共产党坚持不渝地为实现这个协议而斗争。共产党认为，超党派的联合候选人有助于加强民族团结和建立一个包括全国民主民族力量的联合政府，从而确保选举胜利果实和政府的稳定，并有力量粉碎国内外反动势力对这个人民选举产生的政府必然发动的疯狂进攻。但是，后来由于民主行动党、基督教社会党和共和民主联盟在候选人提名的问题上发生分歧意见，并协议由各个政党分别提出自己的候选人。委内瑞拉共产党为了避免加深分裂，没有提出自己的候选人，宣布支持共和民主联盟提出的候选人拉腊萨巴耳，并且主张在选举以后建立一个包括各政党、各军事共和派别组织和无党派人士在内的全国联盟政府。共产党支持拉腊萨巴耳是因为他在担任军政府委员会主席时期表现了民主倾向，如果他当选总统能够更好地保障全国团结和民主制度，能够保障政界人士和军界人士的团结，使新政府得到稳定。
    委内瑞拉三个总统候选人的提出，虽然在全国团结方面是一个消极的因素，但是，民主行动党、共和民主联盟和基督教社会党曾在10月31日签署了一项协定，保证通过一个拥有最低纲领的全国团结的政府来保卫宪政，保卫根据12月7日选举结果执政的权力。
    共产党认为，协定中的保卫宪政和根据选举结果进行执政的权力，建立全国团结的联合政府，制定共同的最低纲领，实行政治休战和支持选举的结果，是这个协定的积极一面，表示加以支持；但是，由于协定同意各个政党提出自己的候选人，这是消极的一面，因此，共产党没有在这个协定上签字。
    当选总统贝坦科尔特的民主行动党是委内瑞拉一个最大的资产阶级政党，它代表着民族资产阶级的利益，同时在小资产阶级以至一部分劳动人民当中享有威信。贝坦科尔特曾提出一项资产阶级民主改革的竞选纲领，主张限制美国石油垄断资本的活动，尊重民主自由，实行土地改革和发展独立的民族工业。贝坦科尔特在当选总统后，又在12月10日对一些新闻记者宣布了新政府的纲领。他说，他将保证尊重民主自由，特别是新闻自由；政府不再给外国石油企业更多的租让权，并将建立国家石油公司，从而使开采地下富源造福于委内瑞拉；政府将修改石油特权，得到原油以便同其他国家进行贸易；政府将鼓励外来移民，并实行庞大的公共工程计划，以解决五十万失业者的极端严重的问题。贝坦科尔特的竞选纲领和政府纲领是基本上符合于委内瑞拉人民的愿望的，但是他所代表的民主行动党对美国还有一定程度的幻想。贝坦科尔特曾表示希望得到美国“强大自由阶层”以及得到美国工会运动的支持。另外它反对共产党人参加选举后的新政府。
    委内瑞拉人民在长期反独裁斗争和一年来粉碎国内外反动派颠复活动的艰苦斗争中，大大提高了自己的觉悟，强烈要求全国团结，建立一个确保民主自由和民族独立的政府。这次选举的结果表明，委内瑞拉的爱国民主力量继续有所增长，除了民主行动党得的选票比过去增多以外，共产党在这次选举中得到了全国9％的选票，几乎为1948年选举得票数的四倍；在首都加拉加斯，共产党所得选票为总票数的20％；共和民主联盟的选票也比过去大大增加。选票减少的只有右翼的基督教社会党。通过选举表现出来的委内瑞拉政治力量的这种变化，说明目前委内瑞拉爱国民主力量占居上风，这有利于保证选举后委内瑞拉的团结、稳定和进步。
    美帝国主义和委内瑞拉的反动派是不喜欢委内瑞拉的这种选举结果的。他们为了破坏这次选举，颠复具有民主倾向的军政府委员会，曾进行了不少次阴谋活动。捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡，这是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派的逻辑。美帝国主义和它在委内瑞拉的走狗也是如此。他们必然要对人民选举产生的委内瑞拉新政府进行捣乱。但是，有着十年反独裁斗争经验并在今年1月、7月、9月和11月的起义和反政变斗争中表现了自己的团结和力量的委内瑞拉人民，将对国内外反动派所进行的一切阴谋活动提高警惕。
