Four Key Points

To improve the quality of homemade cement, four key points must be grasped:

(1) The proportioning of ingredients must be reasonable. For lime-clay cement, generally 100 jin of lime can be mixed with 30 to 36 jin of clay. If the iron content in the clay is low, 1%-2% iron powder can be added, along with 10%-15% coal powder, mixed into balls, and calcined. The fewer impurities in the raw material and the purer the raw material, the better the quality of the finished product.

(2) Mixing must be uniform. Uneven mixing will result in undercooked balls after calcination, which will affect the quality of the cement. To ensure the balls are uniform, it is best to use a mixer. If mixing by hand, it must be mixed repeatedly several times until evenly mixed.

(3) The calcination temperature must reach above 1400 degrees Celsius, the heat must be even, and it must be thoroughly burned and cooked. If there is no instrument to determine the temperature inside the kiln, it can also be visually estimated. Generally, when the material balls turn white and the fire is dazzling, it basically meets the temperature requirements. The calcined material balls, after cooling, are blackish-green.

(4) The finer the grinding, the better. Using a local wind sifter for powder selection not only ensures uniform fineness, but is also more efficient than sieving with a sieve.

    四个关键
    提高土制水泥质量要抓四个关键：
    （一）配料必须合理。石灰烧粘土水泥，一般可用一百斤石灰加三十斤到三十六斤粘土。如果粘土中的含铁量少，可加铁粉1％—2％，再加10％—15％的煤粉，拌合成球，进行煆烧。生料杂质愈少，原料愈纯，成品质量愈好。
    （二）拌合必须均匀。拌料不匀，煆烧后的成球夹生，就会影响水泥质量。为使成球均匀，最好使用拌料机拌和，如用手工搅拌，必须反复多拌几次，直到拌匀为止。
    （三）煆烧的温度必须达到一千四百度以上，火力要匀，要烧透，烧熟。没有仪器鉴定窑内的温度，也可以用目测，一般烧到料球发白，火光刺目，就基本上符合温度要求。已经烧透的料球冷却后，呈黑绿色。
    （四）磨碎的细度愈细愈好，用土风筛机进行选粉，不仅细度均匀，而且比筛子筛的效率高。
