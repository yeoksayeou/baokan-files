    Red Flags Flutter Along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line
  Red flags flutter along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line,
  Militia road builders sing:
  The Great Leap Forward, trains are busy,
  A single-track railway cannot supply enough,
  We will build another one,
  So that trains can run back and forth,
  To prosper the economy and strengthen national defense.

    津浦线上红旗飘
  津浦线上红旗飘，
  修路民兵把歌唱：
  大跃进，火车忙，
  单线铁道供不上，
  我们再来修一条，
  让咱火车来回跑，
  繁荣经济固国防。
