    Old Model, Good Style
    Su Dianxuan Consistently Cares About the Production and Life of the Masses
    Su Dianxuan, a 61-year-old model worker and Communist Party member representing the Malou branch of the Lushan County People's Commune in Henan, has come to Beijing again to attend the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units.

    Su Dianxuan often says, "Listening to the Party and following the mass line are the first essentials for doing a good job." Over the years, he has consistently adhered to the working style of the mass line in his work, always soliciting the opinions of the masses before doing anything. Therefore, for the past eight years, the Happiness Agricultural Cooperative he has led has always been a red banner in Henan Province. Malou Township, which had a yield of only a hundred or so catties per mu before liberation, has now changed its impoverished face and begun to embark on the road to a well-fed and clothed life. In the past few years, their cooperative has supported the state with more than 1.5 million catties of grain alone.

    Always being ahead of others in everything is Su Dianxuan's greatest characteristic. Every time the Party calls for a new task, Comrade Su Dianxuan always takes the lead. This autumn, when planting sweet potatoes, the cooperative lacked sweet potato seedlings, and it looked like the planting time would be delayed. Everyone was at a loss. He inquired everywhere and even ran to the mountainous area more than thirty miles away to carry them back. On the road, the load was heavy, and the road was uneven. He fell several times and broke his leg. But he still persevered and carried them all the way home, ensuring timely planting. During the mass steelmaking campaign, he also ran dozens of miles to deliver iron sand. The cooperative members told him not to go, but he secretly took a small road and delivered it.

    The Peng River is a winding and treacherous river that has brought countless disasters to the people of Malou Township for thousands of years. Last year, when the Party called for large-scale water conservancy projects, Su Dianxuan led technical personnel to personally inspect and measure, and mobilized his two sons to take the lead in managing the river. Thanks to the full mobilization of the masses, after several months of hard work, a large reservoir with a storage capacity of 50 million cubic meters was built in the upper reaches of the Peng River, cutting off the Peng River and turning 100,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

    Su Dianxuan is always concerned about the lives of the masses. After the people's commune was established, he took the lead in setting up canteens, personally helping the cooks with their work, improving the management of the canteens, and making the food delicious and flavorful, so that the commune members could eat their fill and eat well. The cooperative's home for the elderly was established under his personal supervision. He donated some of the furniture from his own home to the home for the elderly, allowing the homeless elderly to enjoy their old age. At that time, an elderly widow named Liu, who was ninety-nine years old and unable to walk, Comrade Su Dianxuan personally carried her to the Happiness Home. When the commune members were panning for iron sand in the river and it rained heavily, soaking their clothes, Comrade Su Dianxuan immediately sent his own cotton-padded clothes to the river for the commune members to wear. Under his leadership, many cadres and the masses donated their cotton-padded clothes to these steel warriors.

    Comrade Su Dianxuan is such a person. Because he listens to the Party, adheres to the mass line, and cares about the sufferings of the masses, he has won the love and support of the masses and was honorably elected as a representative to attend the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction.

    老模范  好作风
    苏殿选一贯关心群众的生产和生活
    河南鲁山县人民公社马楼分社的代表，六十一岁的老模范、共产党员苏殿选，这次又到北京出席全国农业先进单位代表会议来了。
    苏殿选常常说，“听党的话，走群众路线，是作好工作的第一个要领”。这些年来，他在工作中一直坚持着群众路线的工作作风，遇事先征求群众的意见。因此，八年来他所领导的幸福农业社，始终是河南全省的一面红旗。解放前每亩只有百十斤产量的马楼乡，现在改变了贫困面貌，开始走上了丰衣足食的道路。几年来他们社仅支援国家的粮食就有一百五十多万斤。
    凡事走在前边，是苏殿选同志最大的特点。每次党号召进行一个新的工作，苏殿选同志总是带头先干。今年秋季种红薯时，社里缺红薯秧，眼看就要耽误播种时间，大家束手无策，他到处打听消息，竟然跑到三十多里远的山区去担。在路上，担子重，路不平，他一连跌了好几跌，腿也跌破了。但他还是坚持着，一直担到家，保证了适时栽种。在全民炼钢铁的运动中，他还跑几十里地送铁砂，社员们不叫他去，他偷偷走小路送去了。
    彭河是一条蜿蜒曲折的害河，千百年来也不知给马楼乡人民带来了多少灾难。去年党号召大兴水利，苏殿选便带领技术人员去亲自查看测量，并动员他的两个儿子带头去治河，由于群众发动充分，经过几个月的苦战，就在彭河上游修起一座蓄水五千万公方的大水库，斩断了彭河，把十万亩旱地变成了水田。
    苏殿选随时随地都是很关心群众生活的。人民公社化以后，他带头搞食堂，亲自帮助炊事人员工作，改进食堂的管理，把饭菜做的可口有味，让社员们吃饱吃好。社里的敬老院是在他亲自主持下办起来的，他把自己家里的部分家具献给敬老院，让无依无靠的老人们乐度晚年。当时有一位九十九岁的孤寡刘老太太不能走路，苏殿选同志就亲自把她背到幸福院里。社员们在河里淘铁砂，天下大雨，衣服淋湿了，苏殿选同志马上把自己的棉衣送到河里让社员们穿。在他的带头下，许多干部群众献出了棉衣给这些钢铁战士。
    苏殿选同志就是一个这样的人，由于他听党的话，坚持走群众路线，关心群众的疾苦，因而取得了群众的爱戴和拥护，这次光荣的被选为出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的代表。（宋杰、陈之炳）（附图片）
