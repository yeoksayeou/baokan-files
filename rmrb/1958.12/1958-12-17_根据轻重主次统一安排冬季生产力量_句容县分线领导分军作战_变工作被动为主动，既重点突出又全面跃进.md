Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 16th: The Jurong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has adopted a method of dividing leadership into lines and armies to fight, arranging leadership and labor forces in a unified manner with both emphasis on key points and division of labor, so that various tasks in the winter production campaign advance simultaneously.

    Jurong has many mountains, and has historically been threatened by mountain floods and droughts. To further solve the food problem next year, the water conservancy problem must be solved first. Therefore, the water conservancy tasks this winter and next spring are more arduous than last winter and this spring. Field management of the three wheat crops is the first battle to win a greater agricultural harvest next year. This is a broad and large-scale, detailed task, requiring the arrangement of a certain amount of labor to grasp it firmly to the end. In addition, it is also necessary to develop industry, afforestation, develop sideline occupations, and strengthen the work of collective life in the communes. To complete these tasks, it is necessary to highlight key points and achieve an overall leap forward. Under these circumstances of many projects, heavy tasks, and tight schedules, it is particularly important to rationally arrange and allocate labor. However, some cadres did not fully understand this point, and there was a more common idea of "blocking wherever it comes from, going wherever it is needed," lacking comprehensive and planned arrangements. Therefore, the work was passive and progress was slow.

    In order to change the passive situation, the Jurong County Party Committee, based on the needs of the tasks and the situation of the various communes, decided to divide the county's 155,000 laborers into four fronts according to priorities: The first front is the water conservancy field army. According to the winter and spring water conservancy tasks, 65,000 laborers have been invested in this front. The second front is the expeditionary force for going up the mountains to mine, and for the Grand Canal and railway double-track engineering projects. This group of 35,000 laborers are mostly young and strong lads. The third front is the rear production force, responsible for field management, forestry, sideline occupations, and logistics work. This line has a total of 26,000 laborers. The fourth front is the management, distribution and welfare team, with a total of 14,000 people. Each of the above four fronts has a Party Secretary in command. Professional teams have been organized in each army, and a responsibility system has been established to conduct inspections and evaluations regularly or in stages. Li Yongyue, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and the First Secretaries of the various commune and brigade Party committees are responsible for the unified command of the various armies.

    The working method of dividing leadership into lines and armies to fight has not only guaranteed the water conservancy focus, but also enabled the overall leap forward of various tasks. The progress of water conservancy projects has been accelerated. The average earthwork efficiency of large and medium-sized projects has leaped from the initial one or two cubic meters to more than nine cubic meters. Now, the first phase of eight large reservoir projects has been basically completed, and the 60,000-strong water conservancy corps has been successively transferred to the Gao (Chun) - Jurong - Dan (Yang) Grand Canal and the construction sites of the remaining eight large reservoirs. In the rear, field management and sideline production have also completely changed the situation of water conservancy taking off, field management being relaxed, and sideline production almost stagnating. Winter irrigation and soil covering measures taken to prevent frost and drought are being carried out in an all-round way. The wheat and rapeseed fields, which account for half of the total area, have generally been top-dressed with winter fertilizer once; in order to ensure more than 600,000 full seedlings per mu, replanting has been completed in more than 30,000 mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings, and more than 7,000 mu of Taiping seedlings of three wheat crops and rapeseed have been planted in preparation for transplanting to fill gaps. At present, the growth of wheat seedlings and rapeseed seedlings is good, and there are very few third-class seedlings. Sideline production has also improved greatly. Various communes have established various professional teams based on local resources, mass habits, and talents, and have achieved great results. Taking the Xia Shu Commune as an example, in the month or so since the division of lines, a total of fifteen sideline occupations have been carried out, with a total production value of more than 224,000 yuan, equivalent to the total sideline production value of the ten months before the division of lines and armies. Because various communes have taken up sideline production, there is sufficient guarantee for the plan that each member will receive an average of 10 to 15 yuan in cash before the end of the year. At the same time, the rectification of living welfare organizations such as canteens and nurseries has been completed. The canteen has implemented the "four-in-one" method of being a cook, a feeder, a vegetable grower, and an administrator. Although the number of service personnel has been greatly reduced, the work has been done well. A new atmosphere has emerged on the living welfare front. People are eating their fill and staying warm, and the masses' production enthusiasm is high.

    根据轻重主次统一安排冬季生产力量
    句容县分线领导分军作战
    变工作被动为主动，既重点突出又全面跃进
    本报南京16日电  中共句容县委采取分线领导、分军作战的方法，既有重点，又有分工地统一安排领导力量和劳动力，使冬季生产运动中的各项工作都同时跃进。
    句容全境多山，历年来受山洪和干旱威胁很大，要在明年进一步解决粮食问题，首先必须解决水利问题，因此，今冬明春水利任务较去冬今春繁重。三麦田间管理，是争取明年农业更大丰收的第一仗，这是一项面广量大的精细的工作，需要安排一定的劳动力，狠狠地抓到底。此外，还要发展工业、绿化造林、发展副业，以及加强公社集体生活的工作等。完成这些任务，既要重点突出，又要全面跃进。在这种项目多、任务重、时间紧迫的情况下，合理地按排和调配劳动力，就显得特别重要。但是，部分干部曾经对这一点认识不足，较普遍地存在着“哪里来哪里挡，哪里要哪里去”的思想，缺乏全面有计划的安排。因此，工作被动，进度缓慢。
    为了改变被动局面，句容县委根据任务需要和各个公社的情况，确定将全县十五万五千劳动力，分别轻重、主次分成四条战线，第一条战线是水利野战兵团。根据冬春水利任务，已投入这条战线的劳动力六万五千人。第二条战线是上山开矿，远征大运河和铁路复线工程的远征大军。这一路三万五千劳动力大都是年青力壮的小伙子。第三条战线是后方生产部队。负责田间管理、林、副业和后勤工作。这一线的劳力共二万六千人。第四条战线是管理分配和生活福利队伍，共有一万四千人。以上四条战线，都有一个党的书记挂帅。各路大军都组织了专业队，建立了责任制，定期或定阶段进行检查评比。县委第一书记李永月和各个公社、大队党委的第一书记，负责统一指挥各路大军。
    分线领导、分军作战的工作方法，既保证了水利重点，又使各项工作全面跃进。水利工程进度已经加快，大、中型工程的平均土方工效，从初期的一、二方一跃再跃到九方多，现在，第一期八个大水库工程已经基本结束，六万人的水利兵团已经陆续转战到高（淳）句（容）丹（阳）大河和其余八个大水库工地上去。在后方的田间管理和副业生产上，也彻底改变了水利上马、田间管理放松、副业生产几近停顿的情况。为了防冻、防旱而采取的冬灌和复土等措施，正在全面进行，占总面积一半的麦田和油菜田，已经普遍追上一次腊肥；为了保证每亩六十万以上全苗，在三万多亩缺苗的麦田里完成了补种，并种了七千多亩三麦和油菜的太平苗，准备移栽补缺。现在麦苗和油菜苗生长情况良好，三类苗极少。副业生产上也大有起色。各个公社根据本地资源、群众习惯和人才，建立各种专业队，取得了很大成绩。仅以下蜀公社为例，分线以来一个多月，共搞了十五项副业，生产总额二十二万四千多元，相当于分线分军前的十个月副业生产总额。由于各个公社都抓起了副业生产，使年关前每个社员平均分配到十元到十五元现金的规划，已有足够的保证。与此同时，完成了对食堂、托儿所等生活福利组织的整顿。食堂实行了既是炊事员、又是饲养员、种菜员和管理员的“四员合一”的办法，服务人员数量上虽大大减少，而工作却搞好了。生活福利战线出现了一片新气象，吃饱吃暖，群众生产情绪高涨。
