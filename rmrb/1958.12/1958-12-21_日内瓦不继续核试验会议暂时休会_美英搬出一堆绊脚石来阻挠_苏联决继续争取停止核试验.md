Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, December 19th. The Three-Power Conference on the Discontinuation of Nuclear Weapon Tests announced a temporary adjournment today, and decided to resume work on January 5, 1959.

At today's meeting, the representatives of the three countries exchanged views on the progress made by the conference to date and the important and difficult negotiation issues ahead.

A communique issued after the meeting said that the US representative presented a document on the full-time personnel and equipment needed for the establishment of a system for reconnaissance and verification. The representatives continued to discuss some of the documents previously submitted at the meeting.

The Conference on the Discontinuation of Nuclear Weapon Tests, convened on October 10, has now passed four articles of the draft treaty, which marks significant progress in moving towards its goal. However, for a bright prospect, it is still necessary to eliminate the dark clouds from the West.

In the past, the American and British delegations created numerous difficulties on every issue and every clause of the draft treaty to hinder the progress of the conference. They insisted on discussing the supervisory system as a priority before reaching an agreement on the prohibition of testing, which resulted in the waste of about five weeks of the conference's time. Now the conference is about to discuss the issue of the duration of the ban on testing. According to conference sources, the United States and Britain have not abandoned their repeatedly advocated plan for a temporary ban on testing.

Another stumbling block set up by the US and UK is in the working principles of the supervisory committee. That is to say, the substantive question is whether substantive issues should be decided by the unanimous agreement of the three countries, as requested by the Soviet Union, or by a simple majority, as suggested by the West. The functions and interrelationships of the various components, the principles of personnel selection, etc., will all be difficult issues if the West continues to insist on its unreasonable attitude.

After the adjournment of today's meeting, the head of the Soviet delegation, Tsarapkin, held a press conference.

Tsarapkin said that the achievements made by the conference so far should not be overestimated. He called on the world not to relax its efforts to make the conference a success.

The Soviet representative pointed out that the large number of letters sent to the Geneva delegation from all over the world and the appeals of many representatives sent to Geneva show that the struggle to ban nuclear testing has developed into a world-wide and broad movement, and no responsible government can ignore this call from the people all over the world.

He said that the Soviet Union sent a delegation here with the hope of reaching an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests. At the beginning of the conference, the Soviet delegation submitted a draft agreement and documents on the supervisory organization, but the United States and Britain did not consider the Soviet proposals and attempted to force the Soviet Union to accept their "work plan." They refused to agree to the Soviet proposals for a long time, while failing to put forward their own specific proposals. This attitude delayed the progress of the conference.

Referring to the already adopted clauses of the agreement, Tsarapkin said that the adoption of these clauses is only a preliminary achievement, and does not mean that everything has been resolved. The serious obstacles created by the American and British sides still exist. He concluded by saying that the Soviet Union will continue to work to ensure that the conference can reach an agreement on an unconditional, immediate, and permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests.

### 日内瓦不继续核试验会议暂时休会  美英搬出一堆绊脚石来阻挠  苏联决继续争取停止核试验

    日内瓦不继续核试验会议暂时休会
    美英搬出一堆绊脚石来阻挠  苏联决继续争取停止核试验
    新华社日内瓦19日电  关于不继续试验核武器三国会议今天宣告暂时休会，并且决定在1959年1月5日继续进行工作。
    在今天的会议上三国代表就迄今为止会议所取得的进展以及摆在前面的重要而困难的谈判问题交换了意见。
    会后发表的公报说，美国代表提出了一个关于需要设立的关于侦察和核实制度的专职人员和装备的文件。代表们继续讨论了以前在会议上所提出的一些文件。
    不继续试验核武器会议是在10月10日召开的，到现在已经通过了条约草案中的四条，这标志了会议在走向它的目的方面有了重大的进展。但是，要有光明前景，还需要消除来自西方的乌云。
    过去美国和英国代表团对每一个问题和条约草案的每一项条款上都制造了重重困难，以妨碍会议的进展。它们坚持要在达成禁止试验的协议以前优先讨论监督制度，结果使会议浪费了五个星期左右的时间。现在会议要讨论的是禁止试验期限的问题。据会议人士说，美国和英国还没有放弃它们一再主张的暂时禁止试验的打算。
    美英所布置的另一块绊脚石在监督委员会的工作原则方面。那就是说，实质问题是像苏联所要求的那样由三国一致同意来决定呢，还是像西方所建议的那样只由简单多数来决定的问题。至于各个组成部分的职能和相互关系、人员选择的原则等，都将是困难重重的问题，如果西方继续坚持它们无理的态度的话。
    今天会议休会后，苏联代表团团长查拉普金举行了记者招待会。
    查拉普金说，不要过高估计会议到目前为止所取得的成绩。他要求全世界不要放松使会议获得成功所进行的努力。
    苏联代表指出，从世界各地寄到日内瓦代表团的大量的信件和派到日内瓦的许多代表的呼吁表明，禁止核试验的斗争又发展成世界性的广泛的运动，任何负责的政府都不能忽视世界各地人民的这种呼声。
    他说，苏联怀着就停止核武器试验取得协议的希望派代表团前来这里。苏联代表团在会议开始时便提出了协议草案和关于监督组织的文件，但是美国和英国不考虑苏联的建议，企图强使苏联接受它们的“工作计划”。它们长时期拒绝同意苏联的建议，同时又提不出它们自己的具体建议。这种态度拖延了会议的进展。
    查拉普金谈到已经通过的协议条款说，通过这些条款只是初步的成就，并不意味着一切都已解决，美国和英国方面所制造的严重障碍仍然存在。他最后说，苏联将继续努力，以便使会议能够达成无条件地立即永久停止核武器试验的协定。
