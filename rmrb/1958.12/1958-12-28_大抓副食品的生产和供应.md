Editorial:

    The Central Committee and Chairman Mao have instructed us to pay attention to both production and livelihood during the Great Leap Forward. Production and livelihood must be grasped simultaneously. Currently, striving to resolve the production and supply of non-staple foods is a very important aspect of grasping livelihood.
    This year is the first year of our people's three years of hard struggle. Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party committees, commercial departments in various regions have made great efforts to supply non-staple foods to the vast urban and rural populations, and to ensure the smooth progress of industrial and agricultural production, despite the exceptionally tense situation in industrial and agricultural production. Generally speaking, the production of non-staple food raw materials this year has increased compared to last year, with the exception of a few varieties. Taking the production of live pigs as an example, according to the statistics of the State Statistical Bureau, by the end of September 1958, the number of live pigs raised nationwide had reached over 210 million, an increase of 49% compared to the beginning of the year. By the end of November, aquatic products had reached 6.45 million tons, nearly double the amount of last year, with fish and shrimp increasing by 2 million tons compared to last year. In recent months, due to the great efforts invested in steel production and autumn harvesting, deep plowing, and water conservancy construction, some non-staple food raw material production has been affected and reduced due to the temporary inability to manage both. The current shortage of some non-staple food supplies is mainly not due to the reduction in the production of non-staple food raw materials, but rather to the lack of labor and transportation capacity, making it difficult to process and transport them in a timely manner. At the same time, due to the rapid development of industrial production, the population of cities and industrial and mining areas has increased significantly (this year, industrial and mining enterprises have added approximately 7 million apprentices, temporary workers, and workers). After the establishment of people's communes in rural areas, the lives of farmers have improved, so while the production of non-staple foods has increased, it is still insufficient compared to the faster-growing consumption needs. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that the insufficient supply of some non-staple foods is a temporary phenomenon that is difficult to completely avoid on the road of the victorious development of our socialist construction cause. As long as we take the initiative and actively grasp the solution, the situation of insufficient production and supply of non-staple foods can be reversed. Now, the tasks of autumn harvesting and deep plowing have been completed in most parts of the country, and the production task of 10.7 million tons of steel has also been successfully completed ahead of schedule and above target. Although water conservancy construction in various regions still requires a considerable amount of labor and transportation capacity, there are already conditions in rural areas to extract a certain amount of labor and transportation capacity for sideline production, processing and transporting non-staple foods. This is a favorable condition for solving the problem of non-staple foods at present.
    The primary issue now is to give sufficient attention to the work of supplying non-staple foods ideologically, that is, to correctly recognize the important significance of doing a good job in the people's livelihood. Production and livelihood are two important aspects of social life, and we must view this issue from a dialectical materialist perspective. Production is fundamental. Only on the basis of constantly expanding and developing production can the material living standards of the people be continuously improved and raised. However, if the people's livelihood is well managed, it will inevitably greatly promote the development of production. Therefore, production and livelihood must be grasped simultaneously, and neither should be neglected. Not only that, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care about the people's livelihood. It is difficult and unsustainable to do a good job in production without improving livelihood. Production and livelihood are also "two legs," and we must learn to walk on two legs in this matter as well. Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound exposition on the idea of "walking on two legs" as early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War. He said: "If we only mobilize the people to wage war and do nothing else, can we achieve the goal of defeating the enemy? Of course not. If we want victory, we must also do a lot of work. Leading the peasant's land struggle, distributing land to the peasants; improving the peasant's labor enthusiasm, increasing agricultural production; protecting the interests of the workers; establishing cooperatives; developing foreign trade; solving the masses' problems of clothing, food, housing, firewood, rice, oil, salt, disease and hygiene, and marriage. In short, all the practical life problems of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become the organizers of the people's lives, and the masses will truly rally around us and warmly support us." ("Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods") Does not the basic spirit of this passage spoken by Comrade Mao Zedong more than 20 years ago have very realistic significance for our current work?
    Over the past year, under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses of the people have labored selflessly with great revolutionary enthusiasm, and have achieved unprecedented great achievements on all production fronts. Now, making a major effort to improve livelihood, doing a good job in the supply of non-staple foods, and making the people live better while achieving brilliant results in hard work is of particular political significance for encouraging the broad masses to strive for a greater leap forward next year. We believe that at present, we should not only grasp livelihood while grasping production, but also emphasize grasping livelihood; we should not only grasp rural livelihood, but also grasp urban livelihood at the same time; we should take the same effort as we did in making steel this year to improve the people's livelihood, and vigorously grasp the production and supply of non-staple foods.
    The most fundamental way to continuously improve and expand the supply of non-staple foods is to start from the production and processing of non-staple food raw materials. Most of the raw materials for non-staple foods come from rural areas. A noteworthy situation at present is that after the people's communes were established, some people believed that "communes cannot engage in commodity production," and in a few places, even the non-staple food raw materials that should have been sold were consumed by themselves. This is, of course, a misunderstanding. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly pointed out in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" that after the people's communes were established, commodity production and commodity exchange are not to be reduced. On the contrary, they will have a great development in a necessary historical period in the future. Therefore, the people's communes must make the greatest efforts at present to greatly develop non-staple food raw materials and other commodity production in a relatively short period of time, and expand commodity exchange. Particular attention should be paid to strengthening the fattening of live pigs and the fishing of aquatic products. In areas where conditions permit, the production of winter vegetables should be rapidly expanded so that these non-staple food raw materials can be supplied to the market more quickly. Commune members can also continue to operate some small household side businesses, provided that it does not hinder their participation in collective labor. This can not only meet the consumption needs of urban and rural people, especially urban people, for non-staple foods, but also, through commodity exchange, people's communes and commune members can increase their income and obtain the necessary agricultural means of production and means of subsistence.
    The solution to the problem of non-staple food supply is greatly related to the production and life of urban people. Therefore, it is difficult to rely on these areas to solve the supply of non-staple foods themselves. When arranging the supply of non-staple foods, all localities must first pay attention to meeting the needs of large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas. These areas have a great need for non-staple foods, both in terms of variety and quantity, and especially need the support of various localities. We believe that the Party committees and commercial departments in various localities will definitely provide strong support to these areas in the spirit of taking care of the overall situation, and resolutely complete the task of allocating non-staple foods to these areas.
    Before the Spring Festival, it is necessary to purchase a large number of various types of non-staple foods that can be purchased and transported from rural areas, and transport them to cities and industrial and mining areas. The time is tight and the task is arduous. Therefore, the transportation link must be strengthened. The state is preparing to organize several concentrated transportation efforts for non-staple foods in the next month. Vigorously solving the problem of short-distance transportation and concentrating materials to the station in a timely manner is the key to completing the concentrated transportation. All localities must firmly grasp this link and take corresponding measures. In transportation, we should also conscientiously implement the principle of combining concentrated transportation with regular transportation, and prevent the emergence of ideas and practices that rely on concentrated transportation and relax regular transportation, so as to quickly and continuously transport non-staple foods out to supply the market.
    The commercial departments in cities and industrial and mining areas must make the improvement of non-staple food supply their top priority at present. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees and with the support of various localities, they must organize and mobilize commercial department employees to do their best to do a good job in purchasing and transporting, and try to use beans, potatoes, etc. as non-staple foods to expand the source of non-staple foods. Urban commercial departments should also continuously improve the methods of supplying non-staple foods in accordance with the principle of facilitating the purchase of the masses, and reduce the phenomenon of the masses waiting in long lines to purchase.
    As long as we are ideologically clear about the great significance of grasping livelihood, properly arrange life on the basis of a bumper harvest and under the principle of planned consumption, and live a good life, the temporary problem of insufficient production and supply of non-staple foods can certainly be appropriately resolved in a relatively short period of time.

### 大抓副食品的生产和供应

    大抓副食品的生产和供应
    中央和毛主席指示我们在大跃进中要注意一手抓生产，一手抓生活。生产和生活两个方面，要同时抓起来。在当前，努力解决副食品的生产供应问题，是抓生活的一个很重要的方面。
    今年是我国人民苦战三年的头一年。一年来，各地商业部门在党委领导下，在工农业生产异常紧张的情况下，对于广大城乡人民对副食品的供应，保证工农业生产的顺利进行，尽了很大的努力。今年副食品原料的生产除少数品种外，总的说来是比去年增加了。以生猪的生产为例，据国家统计局的统计，截至1958年9月底，全国生猪的饲养量已经达到二亿一千多万头，比年初增加了49％。水产品截至11月底已经生产六百四十五万吨，比去年增加近一倍，其中鱼虾类也比去年增加了二百万吨。近几个月来，由于在钢铁生产和秋收、深翻地和兴修水利等方面投入了很大的力量，一时兼顾不过来，少数的副食品原料的生产受到影响而有所减少。目前某些副食品供应不足，主要的并不是因为副食品的原料生产减少，而是因为劳动力、运输力不足，一时难以加工、调运出来。同时也由于工业生产的迅速发展，城市、工矿区的人口都有了显著增加（今年各工矿企业新增加的学徒、临时工和工人达七百万人左右），农村成立公共食堂后，农民生活有了改善，因而副食品的生产虽然有所增加，但是比起增长得更快的消费需要来，就显得不足了。因此，不难看出，某些副食品供应不充足，这是我国社会主义建设事业胜利发展的道路上难以完全避免的暂时的现象。只要我们主动地积极地抓紧解决，副食品的生产和供应不足的情况是可以扭转的。现在，农村秋收和深翻土地任务在全国大部分地区已经完成，一千零七十万吨钢的生产任务也已经胜利地提前超额完成；虽然各地兴修水利还需要相当数量的劳动力、运输力，当前在农村已经有条件抽出一定的劳动力和运输力来进行副业生产，进行副食品的加工和调运工作。这是当前解决副食品问题的有利条件。
    现在的问题首先是要从思想上对副食品供应工作给予足够的重视，也就是说，要正确地认识搞好群众生活的重要意义。生产和生活是社会生活中两个重要方面，我们必须用辩证唯物主义的观点去看待这一问题。生产是根本，只有在不断扩大和发展生产的基础上才能不断地改善和提高人们的物质生活状况。但是，如果群众生活搞得好，又必然会大大地推动生产的发展。因此生产和生活必须同时抓起来，不可偏废。不仅如此，群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众的生活。不搞好生活要搞好生产是困难的，不能持久的。生产和生活，这也是“两条腿”，我们必须在这个问题上也学会用两条腿走路。毛泽东同志早在第二次国内革命战争时期对“用两条腿走路”的思想就做了深刻的阐述。他说：“如果我们单单动员人民进行战争，一点别的工作也不做，能不能达到战胜敌人的的目呢？当然不能。我们要胜利，一定还要做很多的工作。领导农民的土地斗争，分土地给农民；提高农民的劳动热情，增加农业生产；保障工人的利益；建立合作社；发展对外贸易；解决群众的穿衣问题，吃饭问题，住房问题，柴米油盐问题，疾病卫生问题，婚姻问题。总之，一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”（“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”）毛泽东同志在二十多年前所说的这一段话的基本精神，对我们当前的工作难道不是有着非常现实的意义吗？
    一年来，广大人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，以巨大的革命热情忘我地劳动，在各个生产战线上都取得了前所未有的伟大成绩。现在，大抓一下生活，做好副食品供应工作，使人民群众在苦战战绩辉煌的同时，也生活得更好，对于鼓舞广大人民为争取明年更大跃进而奋斗尤其具有重大的政治意义。我们认为，在当前不仅要在抓生产的同时抓生活，而且应该强调地抓一下生活，不仅要抓农村的生活，而且要同时抓城市的生活，要拿出像今年大搞钢铁的劲头来搞好群众生活，大抓副食品的生产和供应工作。
  要不断地改善和扩大副食品供应，最根本的办法是从副食品原料的生产和加工入手。副食品原料大部分来自农村。当前一个值得注意的情况是，在人民公社化以后，由于生产关系发生了变化，有些人就认为“公社不能搞商品生产了”，少数地方甚至把本来应该出售的副食品原料也自己消费掉了。这当然是一种误解。中共八届六中全会在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中就明确地指出，人民公社化以后，商品生产和商品交换不是要缩小，相反的，在今后一个必要的历史时期内还要有一个很大的发展。因此，人民公社在当前必须用最大的努力，在较短的时期内大大发展副食品原料以及其它商品性生产，并扩大商品交换。特别应该注意加强生猪的育肥工作和水产的捕捞工作，在有条件的地区，应当迅速扩大冬季蔬菜的生产，以便能够较快地把这些副食品原料供应市场。社员个人也可以在不妨碍参加集体劳动的条件下继续经营一些家庭小副业。这样做不但可以满足城乡人民特别是城市人民对副食品的消费需要，而且，通过商品交换，人民公社和社员还可以增加收入，得到必需的农业生产资料和生活资料。
    副食品供应问题的解决对于城市人民生产和生活关系甚大。因此依靠这些地区自己解决副食品的供应是困难的。各地在安排副食品供应的时候，必须首先注意满足大、中城市和工矿区的需要。这些地区，对副食品的需要不论在品种上、数量上都是很多、很大的，尤其需要各地的支援。我们相信，各地党委和商业部门一定会本着照顾整体的精神，给这些地区以大力支援，坚决地完成对这些地区副食品的调拨任务。
    在春节前，要把大量分散在农村中的可以收购的各类副食品收购起来，并调运到城市和工矿区去，时间是紧迫的，任务也是艰巨的。因此，必须加强调运环节。国家准备在今后一个月内组织若干次突击调运副食品。大力解决短途运输问题，及时把物资集中到车站，这是完成突击运输的关键。各地必须紧紧地抓住这一环，并采取相应的措施。在运输上，还应该认真地贯彻突击运输与经常运输相结合的方针，防止产生依赖突击运输而放松经常运输的思想和做法，以便迅速地、源源不断地把副食品调运出来，供应市场。
    城市、工矿区的商业部门要把搞好副食品供应做为当前头等重要的任务。要在党委的统一领导下，在各地的支援下，组织和发动商业部门职工千方百计地做好收购、调运工作，并尽量设法利用豆类、薯类等做副食，以扩大副食品的货源。城市商业部门还应该本着便利群众购买的原则，不断地改进副食品供应方法，减少群众长时间排队等购的现象。
    只要我们思想上明确了抓生活的重大意义，在大丰收的基础上，在计划消费的原则下，正确地安排生活，把日子过好，副食品的生产和供应暂时不足的问题，一定能在较短的时间内得到适当的解决。
