Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 4th. President Nasser of the United Arab Republic, in a speech delivered on the 3rd, once again emphasized the importance of the unity of the Arab people, and said, "The struggle against imperialism and its agents is not only ours, but the struggle of the entire Arab nation."

President Nasser made these remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Helwan Railway Vehicle Factory in the suburbs of Cairo. He also said, "Our Arab nationalism and Arab national consciousness have been victorious, and imperialism has retreated."

He pointed out that the agents of imperialism cannot resist the unstoppable force of Arab people and Arab national consciousness in their own countries and throughout the Arab world.

He also pointed out that the Arab people are now able to tell who are the friends who helped and supported them in times of trouble, and who are the enemies who want to turn Arab countries into their spheres of influence.

Referring to Tunisian President Bourguiba's accusations against the UAR, he said, "Bourguiba is trying to divert the Tunisian people's attention from the French occupation of their land, from the French troops and French bases." He also said, "This deception is to paralyze the Tunisian people and turn Tunisia into a sphere of influence for imperialism."

Referring to the groundbreaking of the Helwan Railway Vehicle Factory, President Nasser said, "We fight with one hand and build with the other." He also said, "This is a great battle, which may be more intense and more difficult than a military battle."

Also speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony were Sidky, Minister of Industry of the Central Government of the UAR, and Ibrahim, Chairman of the Economic Organization.

Accompanying President Nasser on his inspection of the factory were the three Vice Presidents of the UAR, ministers of the Central Government of the UAR and the administrative committees of the two regions, members of the Arab Federal Council, Lebanese opposition leader Salam, Yafei, and the Iraqi Ambassador.

The Helwan Railway Vehicle Factory is the second heavy industry factory (the first being the Helwan Iron and Steel Plant) built according to the UAR's Five-Year Industrial Plan. The factory's capital is 500,000 Egyptian pounds. Currently, it produces two vehicles per day, which will later be increased to four.

President Nasser and others also inspected the Helwan Iron and Steel Plant.

    纳赛尔总统再次强调指出
    阿拉伯人应团结反对帝国主义
    新华社开罗4日电  阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔在3日发表演说时再一次强调指出阿拉伯人民团结的重要性，并且说，“反对帝国主义及其代理人的斗争不仅是我们的，而且是整个阿拉伯民族的斗争。”
    纳赛尔总统是在开罗郊外赫万铁路车辆工厂举行开工典礼的时候说这番话的。他还说，“我们阿拉伯民族主义和阿拉伯民族意识已经得到了胜利，帝国主义已经退却。”
    他指出，帝国主义的代理人抵挡不住他们国内的和整个阿拉伯世界的阿拉伯人和阿拉伯民族意识的势如破竹的力量。
    他还指出，阿拉伯人民现在能够说出哪些人是在患难的时候帮助和支持他们的朋友，哪些人是想把阿拉伯国家变成他们的势力范围的敌人。
    在谈到突尼斯总统布尔吉巴对阿联的指责时，他说：“布尔吉巴是在设法转移突尼斯人民对于法国占领他们的国土的注意，转移他们对于法国军队和法国基地的注意。”他还说，“这种欺骗是要麻痹突尼斯人民，而使突尼斯变成帝国主义的势力范围。”
    在谈到赫万铁路车辆工厂的开工时，纳赛尔总统说，“我们用一只手战斗，用另一只手建设”。他还说，“这是一场大战斗，它可能比军事战斗还要激烈，还要困难。”
    在开工典礼上讲话的还有阿联中央政府工业部长西德基和经济组织董事长易卜拉欣。
    陪同纳赛尔总统视察这个工厂的有阿联的三位副总统、阿联中央政府和两个地区行政委员会的部长、阿拉伯联合邦委员会的委员、黎巴嫩反对党领袖萨拉姆、雅非和伊拉克大使。
    赫万铁路车辆工厂是根据阿联五年工业计划建成的第二个重工业工厂（第一个是赫万钢铁厂），这个工厂的资本是五十万埃镑，目前每天生产两台车辆，以后将增加到四台。
    纳赛尔总统等还视察了赫万钢铁厂。
