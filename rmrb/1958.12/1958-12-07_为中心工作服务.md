Serving the Central Task

Taking steel as the key link has driven and promoted everything, including the leap-forward development of the postal and telecommunications services. In the recent months, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the postal and telecommunications departments, focusing on meeting the communication needs of steel production, have launched a mass movement to vigorously develop postal and telecommunications construction throughout the country, resulting in a multiple increase in the postal and telecommunications network.

In the battle to ensure steel communication, the difficulties of manpower, communication equipment, and technology shortages were significant. However, thanks to the Party committees at all levels strengthening their leadership over the postal and telecommunications departments and implementing the policy of relying on the masses to run postal and telecommunications services, many difficulties were resolved. For example, when there was a shortage of wires for circuit erection, the Party committee mobilized various departments to clear warehouses and implement "drought resistance" for communication equipment. When newspaper and mail transportation were strained, the Party committee organized cooperation between transportation and postal and telecommunications departments. When communication equipment was insufficient, postal and telecommunications workers broke the mystique of technology, launched a technical revolution, and vigorously established postal and telecommunications factories to manufacture their own equipment. In a very short period, postal and telecommunications networks were built on steel production bases scattered across the country. In the vast rural areas, the reason why many places were able to achieve telephone access to every township and community and solve the problem of newspaper and mail delivery in a short period of time was also due to reliance on the masses. This shows that postal and telecommunications business work must serve the central task under the leadership and unified arrangement of the Party committee and rely on the masses to operate, in order to have vigorous development and adapt to the needs of the great leap forward.

Although postal and telecommunications work has made great progress under the impetus of taking steel as the key link, it still cannot meet the needs of the continuous great leap forward in industry and agriculture. This is because: on the one hand, the original communication infrastructure was weak and the technology was backward; on the other hand, most of the network construction in the recent period was carried out under the conditions of insufficient manpower and material resources, and some temporary measures were taken at the fastest speed. At present, there are still some important telephone calls that cannot be connected quickly; the quality of communication is not high; the circulation of newspapers has increased significantly, but some cannot be delivered to readers in time. At the same time, due to the all-out effort to ensure steel communication, general communication has not been taken care of enough. Therefore, the tense situation on the postal and telecommunications front has not been eliminated. Next year will be a decisive year for three years of hard work to fundamentally change the face of the motherland. The "small indigenous groups" of the iron and steel industry are entering a new stage of consolidation and improvement, and industry will blossom everywhere; a large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaign will be launched this winter and next spring. In a country as vast as ours, the larger the scale of industrial and agricultural production, the more urgently a well-connected postal and telecommunications network, mainly based on modern tools, is needed. It can be seen that rapidly changing the tense situation of postal and telecommunications is still the primary political task of the postal and telecommunications departments.

To rapidly change the tense situation of postal and telecommunications and better ensure the communication needs of the Party's central tasks, the postal and telecommunications departments must continue to establish a strong concept of business serving politics under the leadership of the Party. After the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, although there are not many people in the postal and telecommunications departments who are detached from the leadership of the Party, detached from politics, and engage in business for business' sake, there are still some. They confine themselves to the business circle, do not take the initiative to understand the central tasks of the Party in each period, do not actively study the Party's instructions and resolutions, and do not arrange their work according to the Party's instructions and central tasks. Therefore, their work is very passive. Once they are asked to serve the Party's central tasks, they are caught off guard, emphasizing the lack of this and that, and complaining that the leadership does not support them. Complaining is useless. Postal and telecommunications are to serve production and construction and to serve the people's lives. Production and construction have different centers in different periods, and postal and telecommunications work can only gain the support of the leadership and the support of the broad masses if it first serves the central task and becomes a powerful weapon for the leading organs to command the central task. In this way, the work can be proactive, and business work can be rapidly developed in serving the central task.

Does emphasizing serving the central task mean that we should not serve general work? No. The central task and general work are a unity of opposites. No central task is an isolated task that is completely unrelated to general work. The central task must be coordinated and supported by general work to develop rapidly. Therefore, when postal and telecommunications work serves the central task, it should also appropriately take care of serving general work. Some comrades oppose serving the central task and serving general work, believing that it is difficult to take care of general needs if the communication needs of the Party's central tasks are to be guaranteed; believing that the needs of steel are guaranteed, the needs of agriculture cannot be guaranteed; believing that the production sector is guaranteed, the consumption sector cannot be taken care of. They do not drive general work with the central task, but seize the center and discard the general. This is wrong. Of course, under the conditions of limited communication equipment, it is in the best interest of the people of the whole country to take less care of general work in order to ensure the needs of the Party's central tasks, and the people will understand. However, the postal and telecommunications departments must never use this as a shield to not actively improve their work and no longer try their best to improve their services to general work.

The postal and telecommunications departments must grasp the two important links of newspaper distribution and long-distance telecommunications to ensure the communication needs of the Party's central tasks. The Party's newspaper is a powerful weapon for publicizing the Party's policies and mobilizing and organizing the masses to accelerate socialist construction. Long-distance telecommunications is an important tool for the Party to grasp the situation in a timely manner and implement the intentions of the leadership. Grasping these two tasks can not only drive the entire postal and telecommunications work, but also grasp the key to business serving politics. To drive the entire postal and telecommunications work through newspaper distribution and long-distance communication, a lot of work must be done. The primary one is to grasp communication equipment. At present, the foundation for manufacturing communication equipment in our country is still extremely weak. The postal and telecommunications departments must vigorously carry out mass movements, make great efforts in technical revolution, and, with the cooperation of relevant departments, rapidly establish and enrich their equipment manufacturing capabilities. For example, the Fujian postal and telecommunications department has only two lathes, but it still has the confidence to manufacture all postal and telecommunications equipment themselves in about three years according to the instructions of the provincial Party committee. However, some people still have an unclear understanding of this important issue. They emphasize that they are busy serving the Party's central tasks and do not have time to engage in mass movements and cannot take care of technical revolution. They do not understand that it is precisely because the work is busy, the tasks are many, and the time is tight that we need to carry out mass movements; it is precisely because the communication equipment is insufficient and the technology is backward that we need to carry out technical revolution. In the leap-forward development of socialist construction, relying only on a few people to handle affairs coldly and relying on limited and backward communication equipment to serve the Party's central tasks cannot fundamentally change the current passive situation.

The new situation of the great leap forward in industry, agriculture, and cultural undertakings in the motherland is constantly putting forward more and higher demands on postal and telecommunications. This is a great thing. New tasks are constantly being put forward, and the postal and telecommunications departments must constantly revolutionize, go all out, and catch up!

    为中心工作服务
    以钢为纲带动和促进了一切，其中也带动和促进了邮电通信事业的飞跃发展。最近几个月来，邮电部门在各级党委的领导下，以满足钢铁生产的通信需要为中心，在全国范围内掀起了大搞邮电建设的群众运动，使邮电网路有了成倍的增长。
    在为保证钢铁通信的战斗中，人力、通信器材和技术缺乏的困难是很大的。但是，由于各地党委加强了对邮电部门的领导，贯彻了依靠群众办邮电的方针，许多困难都迎刃而解。例如架设电路电线不足，党委就动员各部门清理仓库，实行通信器材“抗旱”。报纸和邮件运输紧张，党委就组织交通运输部门和邮电部门协作。通信设备不足，邮电职工就打破对技术的神秘观点，大闹技术革命，大办邮电工厂，自己制造，在很短的时间内，就在全国星罗棋布的钢铁基点上建成了邮电通信网。在广大的农村中，很多地方所以能在短时间内实现了乡乡社社通电话，解决了报纸和邮件的投递问题，也是依靠群众的结果。这说明邮电业务工作，必须在党委的领导和统一安排下，为中心工作服务，依靠群众来办，才能有蓬蓬勃勃的大发展，才能适应一日千里的大跃进的需要。
    邮电通信工作在以钢为纲的带动下，虽然有了很大的发展，但仍不能满足工农业不断大跃进的需要。这是因为：一方面，原来的通信基础薄弱，技术落后；另一方面最近一个时期的网路建设，大多都是在人力、物力不够的条件下，以最快的速度采取的一些临时性的措施。现在，还有一些重要的电话不能迅速接通；通信质量不高；报纸发行量大批增加，但有的不能及时送给读者。同时，由于全力以赴地保证钢铁通信，对一般的通信照顾不够。因此，当前邮电通信战线上的紧张状况仍然没有消除。明年是苦战三年，基本改变祖国面貌的具有决定性的一年。钢铁工业的“小土群”正在进入巩固和提高的新阶段，工业将遍地开花；今冬明春要大搞水利积肥运动。在我们这样一个幅员广大的国家里，工农业生产的规模越大，越迫切需要以现代工具为主的四通八达的邮电网。由此可见，迅速改变邮电通信的紧张状况，仍是邮电部门当前的头等政治任务。
    要迅速改变邮电通讯的紧张状况，更好地保证党的中心任务的通信需要，邮电部门必须继续在党的领导下，树立起业务为政治服务的坚强观念。经过整风和反右派斗争，在邮电部门脱离党的领导、脱离政治、为业务而业务的人虽然不多了，但仍然有。他们把自己束缚在业务圈子里，不主动去了解党委的每个时期的中心任务，没有积极学习党的指示和决议，不按照党委的指示和中心工作来布置自己的工作。因此，他们的工作就很被动，一旦要他们为党的中心任务服务，就措手不及，强调缺这少那，埋怨领导不支持他。埋怨是没有用的。邮电通讯是为生产建设服务的，为人民生活服务的。生产和建设在各个不同时期有不同的中心，邮电通讯工作只有首先为中心工作服务，成为领导机关指挥中心工作的有力武器，才能取得领导的支持，取得广大群众的支持。这样，工作才能主动，业务工作才能在为中心任务服务中得到迅速的发展。
    强调为中心工作服务，是不是就不要为一般工作服务了呢？不是的。中心工作和一般工作是矛盾对立的统一。任何中心工作都不是与一般工作毫无联系的孤立的工作。中心工作必须得到一般工作的配合和支持，才能迅速发展。所以，邮电通讯工作在为中心工作服务的时候，也要适当照顾为一般工作服务。有些同志把为中心工作服务和为一般工作服务对立起来，认为要保证党的中心任务的通信需要，就难以照顾一般的需要；认为保证了钢铁的需要，就不能保证农业的需要；认为保证了生产部门，就不能照顾消费部门。他们不是以中心工作带动一般工作，而是抓住了中心，丢掉了一般。这是不对的。当然在通信设备有限的条件下，为了保证党的中心任务的需要，为一般工作照顾得少一些，是符合全国人民最大利益的，因而人民群众也会谅解。但是，邮电部门决不能以此作为不积极改进工作的挡箭牌，不再千方百计地改善对一般工作的服务。
    邮电部门要保证党的中心任务的通信需要，必须抓住报纸发行和长途电信这两个重要环节。党的报纸是宣传党的方针政策，动员和组织群众加速社会主义建设的有力武器。长途电信是党及时掌握情况，贯彻领导意图的一个重要工具。抓住这两件工作，不但能把整个邮电工作带动起来，而且是抓住了业务为政治服务的关键。要通过报纸发行和长途通信来带动整个邮电工作，必须做很多工作。首要的一条是抓通信设备。目前我国制造通信设备的基础还极为薄弱，邮电部门必须大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，在有关部门的协作配合下，迅速地建立和充实自己的设备制造能力。如福建邮电部门只有两部车床，仍有信心根据省委的指示，在三年左右做到全部自己制造邮电通信设备。但是有些人对这个重要问题还认识不清。他们强调为党的中心任务服务忙，没有时间搞群众运动，顾不得抓技术革命。他们不了解，正因为工作忙，任务多，时间紧，才需要大搞群众运动；正因为通信设备不足，技术落后，才需要搞技术革命。在飞跃发展的社会主义建设中，仅依靠少数人冷冷清清地办事，依靠有限的、落后的通信设备来为党的中心任务服务，就不能从根本上改变当前的被动局面。
    祖国工农业和文化事业大跃进的新形势，不断给邮电通信提出更多、更高的要求。这是一件大好的事情。新的任务不断提出来，邮电部门必须不断革命，鼓足干劲赶上去！
