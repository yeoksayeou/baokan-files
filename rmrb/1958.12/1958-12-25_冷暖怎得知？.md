How to Know If It’s Cold or Warm?

    As the weather turns cold, the weather forecasts published daily by the meteorological observatories in newspapers and broadcasts are attracting more attention and concern. In weather forecasts, we often hear terms such as "highest temperature" and "lowest temperature." How are these measured, and how do they affect people's sense of cold and heat?

    "Air temperature" is the temperature of the air. The temperature of the air varies not only in different locations and at different times, but also at different heights in the same location and at the same time. The air temperatures reported by various meteorological observatories generally refer to surface air temperature, unless a specific height is indicated. The so-called surface air temperature is relative to the air temperature at high altitude and is not the temperature of the air truly close to the ground. To ensure that the observed air temperature is representative, air temperature records at various meteorological observatories are measured under uniformly prescribed standard conditions. These uniformly prescribed standard conditions are: the thermometer is placed in a flat, wide area covered with short grass, two meters above the ground, with unobstructed airflow and no direct sunlight (therefore, it is placed inside a louvered box to meet the latter two conditions). The air temperature measured in this way may differ significantly from the values ​​displayed on thermometers seen by the general public.

    Air temperature changes with time. Generally, the air temperature is highest around 2 p.m. and lowest before sunrise. The highest temperature of the day is called the highest temperature, and the lowest temperature is called the lowest temperature. However, there are exceptions. For example, when very cold air flows in from elsewhere, it may sometimes make the afternoon air temperature colder than the morning air temperature. In this case, the times when the highest and lowest temperatures occur will both change.

    Air temperature mainly varies with latitude, proximity to the sea or land, altitude, and other conditions. Generally, the higher the latitude, the lower the air temperature, and the lower the latitude, the higher the air temperature. For example, Siberia is consistently colder than our country, and northern China is often colder than southern China. In addition, air temperature over the ocean is generally lower than over land in the summer, but in winter, the ocean is generally not as cold as the land. The distribution of air temperature is also related to altitude. Generally, the higher the altitude, the lower the air temperature. For example, in summer, the surface air temperature in our country is very high and hot, but at an altitude of about five kilometers, the air temperature is often below zero degrees Celsius. Similarly, air temperature in plateau areas or high mountains is lower than in plains. For example, many places on the Kangzang Plateau in southwestern China are covered with snow all year round, which is colder than the temperature in the north.

    The sensation of cold or heat is mainly determined by the level of temperature, but the perceived temperature sometimes differs from the actual temperature. The sensation of cold or heat depends on the gain or loss of heat. If heat flows into the body, one feels hot; if heat flows out of the body, one feels cool. The greater the rate of heat flow in or out, the colder it feels; the smaller the rate, the warmer it feels. Although the transfer of heat mainly changes with the difference in air temperature, it is also related to wind speed and air humidity. When the humidity in the air is high, the air transmits heat quickly. Therefore, if the air temperature is the same in winter, when the humidity in the air is high, we will feel particularly cold and damp. When the air is very dry, our sensation of cold will be lighter. In addition, the magnitude of the wind speed is also related to the rate of heat loss. Under the same temperature conditions, it will feel particularly cold when the wind is strong, and the sensation of cold will be lighter when the wind is weak.

    冷暖怎得知？ 
    微风
    天气冷了，气象台每天在报纸上和广播中发布的天气预报，更加引起人们的注意和关心了。在天气预报中，我们常常听到“最高气温”和“最低气温”等名词，到底它们是怎样测得的，它们对人们冷热感觉的影响又如何呢？
    “气温”就是空气的温度。空气的温度不但在不同地点、不同时间会有变化，就是在同一地点、同一时间的不同高度上，气温也是不同的。各气象台所报的气温，除了特别情形指明高度外，一般是指地面气温。所谓地面气温，是同高空的气温相对而言，并不是真正贴近地面上的空气的温度。为了使所观测到的气温具有代表意义，各气象台的气温记录都是在统一规定的标准条件下测得的。这些统一规定的标准条件就是：温度表的置放位置是在平坦宽阔和长满浅草的场地上，并且离地面二公尺高，空气要畅通和不能受太阳光直射，（因此把它放在百叶箱内，以满足这后二个条件）。这样测得的气温，就可能与一般居民所看到的温度表上的数值有相当大的差别。
    气温是随时间变化的，一般下午二时前后气温最高，早晨日出之前气温最低。在一天之内气温最高的一次叫做最高气温，气温最低的一次叫做最低气温。但例外的情形也是有的。例如当很冷的空气从别处流来时，有时会使下午的气温比早上还要冷。在这种情形下，最高气温和最低气温出现的时间就都改变了。
    气温主要随纬度、海陆、高低等条件而不同。一般纬度越高的地方气温越低，纬度越低的地方气温越高。例如西伯利亚常年都要比我国冷，而我国北方又经常是较南方为冷。此外，一般夏季海洋上的气温较陆上为低，但冬季海洋上一般又没有陆上冷的厉害。气温的分布还与高度有关，一般越往高处气温越低。例如夏季我国地面气温很高很热，但到了五公里左近的高空中，气温却经常在摄氏零度以下。同样，高原地区或高山上气温要比平原为低，例如位于我国西南部的康藏高原上的许多地方常年积雪不化，比北方的气温还要低。
    冷热的感觉主要是由温度的高低所决定，但感觉温度与实际温度有时候还有出入。冷热感觉决定于热量的得失，如果热量流入身体，就会感到热；流出身体，就会感觉凉。热量流入、流出的速率大就冷；速率小就热。热量的传送虽然主要随气温差别而变化，但同时还与风速和空气的湿度的大小有关。当空气中的湿度大时，空气传送热量就快，因而如果是在冬季同样气温的情形下，空气中湿度大时，我们就会觉得特别阴冷，空气很干时，我们感觉冷的程度就会轻些。另外，风速的大小与热量散失的速率也有关系。在同样温度的情形下，风大时会显得特别冷，风小时感觉冷的程度就会轻些。
