Xinhua News Agency report:

    Shanghai Civil Design Institute’s young technician Jiang Bingcheng has successfully fired cement in a household coal briquette stove, making it possible to extend the indigenous method of cement production to every household and canteen that burns coal briquettes.

    The method of firing cement in a coal briquette stove is very simple: while cooking, just put coal briquettes containing limestone components into the stove, and cement can be fired. After assessment by personnel from the Shanghai Cement Plant and relevant scientific departments, the quality of the cement fired from this household coal briquette stove meets the standard of #300 cement and can be used for general reinforced concrete structures.

    These coal briquettes are made by grinding and mixing 45% limestone, 5% soil, and 50% coal, and the processing method and cost are similar to those for manufacturing ordinary coal briquettes. Using it to cook provides strong firepower, with very little black smoke, making it more hygienic than ordinary coal briquettes. According to estimates by relevant departments, if all coal briquette factories produce this kind of coal briquette, Shanghai alone could produce hundreds of thousands of tons of cement in households in a year.

    Jiang Bingcheng received support from workers at the Shanghai Cement Plant and coal briquette factories in his endeavor to fire cement in a coal briquette stove.

    煤球炉子烧水泥
    据新华社讯  上海市民用设计院青年技术员姜秉诚，在家庭煤球炉里烧出了水泥，使水泥的土法生产可以推广到烧煤球的每家每户每个食堂。
    煤球炉里烧水泥的方法很简便，做饭时只要把含有石灰石成分的煤球放在炉子里烧，就可以烧出水泥来。经上海水泥厂和有关科学部门的人员鉴定，这种从家庭煤球炉里烧出来的水泥，质量达到三百号水泥的标准，可以作一般性的钢筋混凝土建筑物用。
    这种煤球是用45％的石灰石、5％的泥土和50％的煤，磨碎拌和后制成的，加工方法和成本同制造普通煤球相近。用它烧饭，火力很旺，黑烟很少，比普通煤球卫生。据有关部门估计，如果煤球厂里都生产这种煤球，仅上海一地一年就可以在家庭里制造出几十万吨水泥。
    姜秉诚在煤球炉里烧水泥，得到上海水泥厂和煤球厂工人的支持。
