Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 23rd. Construction on the railway from Beijing directly to Yuanping, Shanxi, has recently begun.

　　The Beijing-Yuanping Railway is also known as the Beijing-Jin Railway.

It is connected to the Beitongpu Railway, with a total length of more than 400 kilometers. There are abundant coal and iron ore deposits along this railway line.

    北京——原平铁路又称京晋铁路。它由北京起，经过河北省的涞源，山西省的灵丘、平型关、繁峙、代县、崞县到达原平。它跟北同蒲路相接连，全长四百多公里。这条铁路的沿线有丰富的煤铁矿藏。这条铁路的修建，对于沟通山西、河北两省交通，繁荣晋东北和冀西的经济，以及开发沿线山区矿藏，都有很大的作用。铁路通车以后，五台、涞源的煤和铁矿石，可以源源运往太原和北京等地的钢铁厂。
