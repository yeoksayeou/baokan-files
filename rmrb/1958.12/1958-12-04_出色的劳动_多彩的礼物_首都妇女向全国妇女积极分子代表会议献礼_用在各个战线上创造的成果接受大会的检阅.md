Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd. Beijing women from all walks of life are accepting the review of the National Conference of Activist Women in Socialist Construction with their outstanding labor achievements. Today, they formed an 800-person gift-giving team to present gifts to the National Conference of Activist Women in Socialist Construction.

At 3:00 p.m., representatives of women from all walks of life in the capital, from various posts, entered the venue with incomparable excitement and joy, carrying various precious gifts, to the music of "Ode to the Motherland." The gift-giving team, led by a group of Young Pioneers and sixteen young women of different nationalities holding colorful flags, walked from the left side of the venue to the rostrum to present their gifts to all the representatives. The arrival of this gift-giving team added a more festive atmosphere to the conference. All the activist women repeatedly expressed their welcome and gratitude to their sisters in the capital with warm applause.

Leading the gift-giving team were the female workers of the capital. Under the leadership of the Party, they are contributing all their strength to the glorious battle of building the capital into an industrial city. Countless models, charts, and objects introduced their great achievements in technological innovation and increasing variety and output. Female workers of the North China Radio Equipment Factory brought their new products such as high and low sound speakers and semiconductor transformers. The brightly colored woolen textiles are new products of the female workers of the newly built woolen mill in the capital this year, some of which have caught up with international standards. In order to welcome the convening of this conference, all the female workers of the Capital Machinery Factory designed and manufactured a large-scale combined noodle machine that can make dumplings, steamed buns, steamed rolls, and noodles. It can make steamed buns for 12,000 people in two hours. This machine was also sent to the venue as a gift today.

Following the female workers were the gift-giving teams from the commercial and service industries. Here are female salespersons, female hairdressers, female cooks, female tailors, and female ticket sellers, who also reported on their labor achievements with charts, paintings, and objects. One chart read: Among the female tram ticket sellers in the city, 274 have been praised by passengers 35,727 times. Some female cooks brought their carefully made delicious dishes and snacks. A huge chart brought by several female commercial workers told people that dozens of women's stores have been established in the city, one of which is one of the 28 red flags in the city's financial and trade system.

Many charts carried by the farm women in the gift-giving team told people that since the establishment of rural people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing, the number of female workers in rural areas has greatly increased, and they have become a main force on the agricultural front. Many high-yield records were created by them in their hard work. Colorful harvest fruits—tomatoes, onions, radishes, eggs, as well as piglets, roosters, and fat ducks—were all brought to the conference by them today. The flower team of the Shangyou People's Commune in Fengtai District also used the flowers they cultivated to weave two large flower baskets as gifts to the conference.

Among the gifts from housewives, the good news brought to the conference is that more than 210,000 housewives in the city are currently participating in production. Many housewives started from scratch and set up processing factories and private factories. Here is a glass chemical fertilizer factory run by seven housewives. The fertilizer they produce is 30% to 45% more effective than ordinary fertilizers. A glass silk factory run by women manufactures glass silk that can replace steel bars for building houses. The ferrous sulfate produced by the women of the ferrous sulfate factory not only supports agricultural production but can also be sold well abroad. Their products were particularly eye-catching in the gift-giving team today.

The female workers who use their skillful hands to manufacture Beijing's special handicrafts brought many exquisite enamel fruit plates, cloisonné vases, gold-lacquered inlaid flying saucers, jade-carved goldfish, velvet silk-made flying birds, and wax-made fruits. These gifts vividly show that the women of the capital are playing their unique talents in the field of special handicraft production.

Among the gifts presented by women in culture and education, medical and health, childcare, and art, there are many children's toys made by childcare workers, poems created by female workers who have just shed their illiteracy caps, and various products made by female students who resolutely implement the policy of combining education with labor production.

The gift presentation by the 800-person gift-giving team lasted a full hour in the venue. The women of the capital presented a total of 566 gifts to the conference. These colorful and diverse gifts, lined up around the venue, were truly dazzling and beautiful, fully demonstrating the great contributions made by Beijing women under the leadership of the Party during the Great Leap Forward.

    出色的劳动  多彩的礼物
    首都妇女向全国妇女积极分子代表会议献礼
    用在各个战线上创造的成果接受大会的检阅
    新华社3日讯  北京市各界妇女以自己出色的劳动成果，接受了全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的检阅。她们今天组成了一支八百人的献礼大队，向全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议献礼。
    下午三时，来自各个不同岗位上的首都各界妇女代表，怀着无比激动和喜悦的心情，带着各种珍贵的礼品，在“歌唱祖国”的乐声中进入会场。献礼队由一群少先队员和手执彩旗的十六个不同民族女青年领先，从会场左边走向主席台，把她们的礼品呈现在全体代表的面前。这支献礼队伍的到来给大会增添了更加欢腾的气氛。全体妇女积极分子们一再以热烈的掌声，向首都的姊妹们表示欢迎和感谢。
    走在这支献礼队伍最前面的是首都的女工们。她们在党的领导下，正在为把首都建设成为一个工业城市的光荣战斗中贡献自己的一切力量。无数的模型、图表和实物介绍了她们在技术革新和增加品种、提高产量等方面取得的巨大成绩。华北无线电器材厂的女工带来了她们创造的高低音喇叭和半导体变压器等新产品。色彩鲜艳的各种毛纺织品是今年首都新建成的毛纺厂女工们的新产品，其中有的已赶上了国际水平。首都机械厂全体女工为了迎接这次会议的召开，自己设计制造了一座能制饺子、花卷、馒头和面条的大型的联合制面机，它每开动两小时，就能制出一万二千人吃一顿的馒头。这部机器今天也作为礼品送到会场上。
    紧接着女工们后面的是商业和服务行业的献礼队。这里有女售货员、女理发员、女炊事员、女裁缝、女售票员，她们也都以图表、画幅和实物汇报了自己的劳动成果。有一张图表上写着：在全市女电车售票员中有二百七十四人受到了乘客三万五千七百二十七次表扬。一些女炊事员们带来了她们精心制作的各色美味的菜肴和点心。几位女商业工作者带来的巨大图表告诉人们，目前全市已成立了几十个妇女商店，其中有一个妇女商店是全市财贸系统二十八面红旗之一。
    献礼队伍中的农妇们抬着的许多图表告诉人们，北京市郊区农村人民公社化以来，农村妇女的出勤人数大大增加，她们已成为农业战线上的一支主力军。不少的高额丰产纪录，就是她们在辛勤劳动中创造出来的。五颜十色的丰收果实——西红柿、洋葱头、萝卜、鸡蛋，还有小猪、公鸡、肥鸭等等，今天都被她们带到大会上来。丰台区上游人民公社的鲜花队，还用她们培植的鲜花编成两个大花篮作为献给大会的礼物。
    在家庭妇女的献礼队伍中，给大会带来的喜讯是：目前全市参加生产的家庭妇女已达二十一万多人。许多家庭妇女白手起家地办起了加工工厂和民办工厂。这里有由七个家庭妇女办起来的玻璃化学肥料厂，她们生产的肥料，肥效超过一般肥料的30％到45％。一所由妇女们办起来的玻璃丝厂，制造出的玻璃丝可以代替建筑房屋的钢筋。硫酸亚铁厂的妇女生产出的硫酸亚铁，不但支援了农业生产，还可以畅销国外。她们的产品今天在献礼队伍中都特别引人注目。
    以精巧的双手制造出北京特种手工艺品的女工们，今天带来了许多精致的珐琅果盘、景泰蓝花瓶、金漆镶嵌的飞天盘、玉刻的金鱼、绒绢做成的飞鸟和腊制的水果。这些礼品生动地表明，首都妇女在特种手工艺生产领域中正在发挥她们特有的才能。
    在文化教育、医务卫生、保育、文艺等方面妇女们所献的礼品中，有保育工作者自制的许多儿童玩具，有刚摘掉文盲帽子的女工们创作的诗篇，还有坚决贯彻教育与劳动生产相结合的方针的女学生们自制的各种产品。
    八百人的献礼队伍的献礼，在会场上整整行进了一个小时。首都妇女们向大会一共献了五百六十六件礼品，这些五光十色、丰富多彩的礼品，排满了会场的四周，真是琳琅满目，美不胜收，充分显示了北京妇女在党的领导下，在大跃进中所作出的巨大贡献。（附图片）
