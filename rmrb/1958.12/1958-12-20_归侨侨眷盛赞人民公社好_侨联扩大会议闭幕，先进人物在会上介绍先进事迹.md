Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 19th. The Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, which concluded on the 17th, adopted a resolution calling on returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students throughout the country to implement the guidelines and tasks for national overseas Chinese affairs work in 1959 proposed by the National Overseas Chinese Affairs Work Conference, namely: Everything for accelerating socialist construction; developing and consolidating people's communes; and further promoting the great patriotic unity of overseas Chinese. The meeting also called on the broad masses of overseas Chinese to develop friendly relations with the local people and to strive for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and for the completion of the great cause of unifying the motherland.

    This meeting was held in Guangzhou City starting on the 11th. Prior to the meeting, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China held a National Overseas Chinese Affairs Work Conference in Guangzhou, which formulated the guidelines and tasks for national overseas Chinese affairs work in 1959.

    This meeting was a great leap forward conference for returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students, as well as a conference to commend advanced role models and exchange advanced experiences. Advanced figures from among the relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese from various fronts of socialist construction in the motherland introduced their advanced deeds and work experiences at the meeting. Advanced figures from rural areas among relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese spoke highly of the people's communes in their speeches. Lin Jin, a returned overseas Chinese from Singapore in Meishan Township, Yunxiao County, Fujian, said that after the establishment of the people's commune, production in their township had greatly developed, with an average yield of more than 3,000 catties per mu for more than 700 mu of paddy fields in the township, more than six times that of the early days of liberation. Li Yuanxing, a returned overseas Chinese from Malaya and a poor peasant from Jianglin Township, Sihui County, Guangdong, used his personal experience to illustrate the goodness of the people's commune. He said that before liberation, he worked hard but was still unable to have enough food and clothing, and had to leave his hometown and go abroad. After liberation, he returned to his hometown, turned himself over, and his hometown quickly changed. The area where he lives is a low-yielding area with a serious shortage of grain; after liberation, production has continued to develop, and last year it was able to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, and this year, due to the realization of communization, it has become a surplus grain township. Advanced producers who have made outstanding contributions on the industrial front spoke enthusiastically about their leap forward deeds. Liu Xuewen, a young worker and relative of overseas Chinese at the Shantou Overseas Chinese Knitting Factory, started working in the factory in 1954 and is now a skilled worker. He learned a set of techniques for designing patterns, and has knitted 38 new varieties in the past year, and also designed and manufactured a small lathe. Zheng Zhengyong, a technician at the Nanjing Chemical Plant and a returned overseas Chinese from Japan, put forward 50 rationalization proposals in this year's technical innovation movement, and one of the proposals alone can save the country 10,000 yuan in investment for the whole year. Returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students on the cultural and educational front also reported on their achievements in implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor.

    At the meeting, Fang Fang, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, awarded banners and certificates to 52 advanced units and 301 advanced workers. The advanced workers who received the awards expressed that they will work even harder in the future and lead all relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to contribute more to the socialist construction of the motherland. And strengthen ties with relatives abroad, so that they will be more closely united around the motherland.

    The meeting elected Zhang Guoji, Xie Xinzheng, and seven others as members of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and removed Li Jingtian, Wang Youxi, Ma Zhenghe, Cai Yanji, and Yang Wenyuan, five right-wing elements, from their positions as committee members. Zhuang Mingli, Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, resigned from his position as Secretary-General due to work reasons. The meeting decided that Wang Yuting would serve as Secretary-General. The meeting also adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and a message of sympathy to the soldiers and civilians on the Fujian front.

    新华社广州19日电  17日闭幕的中华全国归国华侨联合会一届三次全体会议（扩大）作出决议，号召全国归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生贯彻执行全国侨务工作会议提出的1959年全国侨务工作的方针和任务，即一切为了加速社会主义建设；发展和巩固人民公社；更加促进国外华侨的爱国大团结。会议还号召国外广大华侨发展和当地人民的友好关系，并且为解放台、澎、金、马，完成祖国的统一大业而奋斗。
    这次会议是11日起在广州市举行的。会议举行以前，中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会曾在广州举行了全国侨务工作会议，制订了1959年全国桥务工作的方针和任务。
    这次会议是归侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生的跃进大会，也是表扬先进模范人物、交流先进经验的大会。来自祖国社会主义建设各个战线上的侨眷、归侨中的先进人物，在会上介绍了自己的先进事迹和工作经验。来自农村的侨眷、归侨先进人物在发言中盛赞人民公社好。福建云霄县梅山乡新加坡归侨林锦说，成立人民公社后，他们乡的生产有了很大发展，全乡七百多亩稻田平均亩产三千多斤，为解放初期的六倍多。广东四会县江林乡马来亚归侨、贫农李元兴以自己的亲身经历来说明人民公社好。他说，他在解放前辛勤劳动，仍不得温饱，不得不离乡出洋。解放后回到家乡，自己翻了身，家乡也迅速有了改变。他所在的地区是低产区，严重缺粮；解放后，生产不断发展，去年粮食已能自给，今年由于实现了公社化，已变成余粮乡了。在工业战线上作出了卓越贡献的先进生产者畅述了他们的跃进事迹。汕头市华侨针织厂青年工人、侨眷刘学文，1954年入厂做工，现在已经是一名熟练工人。他学会了一套设计花色的技术，一年来织成新品种三十八种，还设计制造了一台小型车床。南京化工厂技术员、日本归侨郑正镛在今年的技术革新运动中共提出了五十条合理化建议，仅其中一项建议，全年就可为国家节约投资一万元。文教战线上的归侨和归国华侨学生，也汇报了他们在贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中获得的成就。
    会上，中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会副主任方方代表华侨事务委员会和全国侨联，授予五十二个先进单位和三百零一名先进工作者以锦旗和奖状。受奖的先进工作者纷纷表示，今后要更加努力，带动全体侨眷、归侨为祖国的社会主义建设贡献更大的力量。并加强同在国外亲人的联系，使他们更加紧密地团结在祖国的周围。
    会议增选张国基、谢心正等九人为全国侨联第一届委员会委员，并且撤销了右派分子李镜天、王幼熙、马政和、蔡衍吉、杨文苑五人的委员职务。全国侨联副主席兼秘书长庄明理因工作关系辞去兼秘书长职务，会议决定由王雨亭担任秘书长，会议还通过了致党中央和毛主席的致敬电和给福建前线军民的慰问电等。
