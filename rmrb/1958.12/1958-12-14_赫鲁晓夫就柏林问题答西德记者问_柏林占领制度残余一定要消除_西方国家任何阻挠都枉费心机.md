Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 12th, TASS: Ulrich Kempski, chief reporter for the German Federal Republic's "Süddeutsche Zeitung," once asked Khrushchev to answer several questions. The full text of Khrushchev's answers to Kempski's questions is published below:

West Berlin Should Become a Free City
No Country Should Interfere With It

Q: Could you talk in more detail about the status of West Berlin as a free city?

A: The Soviet government's proposal to eliminate the remnants of the Berlin occupation regime and transform West Berlin into an independent political entity—a demilitarized free city—outlines the future of West Berlin. We believe that West Berlin should become a free city, and no country, including the two existing German states, should interfere in its economic and political life. The free city of West Berlin should have its own constitution based on democratic principles. This constitution should guarantee all citizens of West Berlin, regardless of political or religious beliefs, basic human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and publication, freedom of assembly and association, and freedom of religious belief. Legislative power will be exercised by a parliament freely elected by the residents, and executive power will be exercised by a government appointed by the parliament. The city will also have its own independent litigation procedures.

The free city of West Berlin will be an economic entity with its own budget, banks, currency circulation, and tax system. All tax revenue will be included in the city budget, and West Berlin taxpayers will no longer have to pay for the German Federal Republic's war preparations and the expenses of foreign occupying forces in West Berlin. After appropriate consultations, the industrial products of West Berlin enterprises can be shipped to the German Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic, as well as to any other country with which the free city has commercial ties, without any restrictions. It is also possible to develop comprehensive, mutually beneficial economic ties with countries in the East and West to ensure the city's economic stability and prosperity. The Soviet side is prepared to provide orders and raw materials to enterprises in the free city, so that residents can be fully employed and the economy can be healthy and stable.

The Soviet government proposes that West Berlin be demilitarized and that no foreign armed forces be stationed in West Berlin. Of course, the free city will have the necessary police force to maintain public order. Some people who advocate maintaining the occupation regime in Berlin now insist that if the troops of the three Western powers withdraw from West Berlin, the city will lose its protection. We hold the exact opposite view: only when the streets of West Berlin are free of American tanks and British artillery and it becomes a free city can a safe environment be created in West Berlin, guaranteeing due security. There may be no better guarantee of West Berlin's security than the obligations that the four major powers and the two German states should undertake, which—if necessary—can be explicitly stipulated in the United Nations. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are willing to provide guarantees for the status of the free city. Only the Western countries currently refuse to do so.

Cutting Out the Malignant Tumor of West Berlin
Will Be the Beginning of Improving the European Situation

Q: From where does the threat to the future status of the free city come—from the East or from the West? In this regard, it must be pointed out that the argument that the German Democratic Republic has any plans to seize West Berlin is completely absurd. If there really were such a plan, then the Soviet Union, as an ally of the German Democratic Republic under the Warsaw Treaty, would not have proposed giving West Berlin the status of a free city, nor would it have expressed its willingness to jointly guarantee its security, wouldn't that be clear? Furthermore, in order to ease tensions in Germany and Europe, the German Democratic Republic is willing to make considerable sacrifices, agreeing to the existence of a free city in the center of the republic and ensuring that this city can have unimpeded exchanges with the East and the West.

Some people talk grandly about the fact that the stationing of a certain number of troops by Western countries in West Berlin is necessary to maintain the current situation in Berlin. These people should learn to realistically assess the current situation. In fact, if there were a reason to resolve the Berlin issue by force, stationing a certain number of troops in West Berlin would hardly be an insurmountable obstacle in the context of modern warfare. On the contrary, these troops stationed in Berlin create a "tumor" that makes all peace-loving people, especially the German people themselves, uneasy, because the development of this tumor could lead to disputes, and then to open armed conflict. Therefore, we suggest cutting out this malignant tumor in order to create conditions that will not only prevent the deepening of tensions in Europe, but will also eliminate them, and ensure an environment conducive to peaceful coexistence. The implementation of our proposals will be the beginning of clarifying and improving the situation in Europe and eliminating this source of trouble in Berlin.

Given the proper mutual understanding and good relations, favorable conditions can be created for solving other more complex problems, especially the issue of troop withdrawals, so that the armed forces of the two opposing military blocs do not directly contact each other, thus creating a zone of separation of armed forces. If Western countries agree to reduce their troops stationed in West Germany, we are prepared to reduce our troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic accordingly. We are even prepared to withdraw all of our troops temporarily stationed in European countries back to our country, if Western countries do the same. If our proposals are accepted, we are willing to establish supervision over the reduction and withdrawal of foreign troops from the two German states. Does the benefit of foreign troops withdrawing from Germany need to be proven? I believe this step would be a great relief to the German people.

Some Foolish People with Loose Tongues
Actually Blathered That the Soviet Union Intended to Seize West Berlin

Speaking of this, I would like to respond to some foolish people with loose tongues who blather that the Soviet Union intends to seize West Berlin. Their argument is completely foolish. Only those who seek to maintain the existing tensions by all means would issue such arguments, while we are committed to creating conditions for eliminating the "Cold War," to creating an atmosphere that will not poison relations between the major powers (and not just the major powers). We sincerely strive to dispel the clouds and mists of some people preparing for a third world war. The Germans in the two German states suffered enormous human and material sacrifices in the war, especially in the most recent war, so they understand more clearly than anyone else what war means. They have tasted the bitterness of war, and I have no doubt that they are opposed to preparing for a third world war. Implementing the Soviet proposals would create good conditions for using material and financial resources more rationally, so that national budgets would no longer be spent on military projects, and this money could be used to raise the living standards of the people.

The status of the free city of West Berlin does not impose any heavy obligations on West Berlin and its residents. We only propose one point: West Berlin must not allow hostile subversive activities and propaganda against any foreign country, especially the German Democratic Republic, to be carried out within its territory. Similarly, the residents of this city will be the first to benefit from this, because they are trapped in various espionage subversive organizations against their will and their lives are seriously threatened. These are some of the considerations that we believe can be adopted in preparing the discussion of the status of the free city of West Berlin. Of course, this issue still needs to be carefully studied, and the Germans themselves can make a great contribution to this matter. In discussing the transformation of West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, the Soviet Union is naturally prepared to put forward more detailed provisions on the status of the free city.

Those Who Want the Soviet Union to Interfere in German Internal Affairs
Are Blinded by a Thick Fog

Q: In the Soviet government's opinion, which issues concerning the status of West Berlin can be the subject of negotiations among the four major powers, and which issues should not be discussed?

A: The Soviet government has stated in its notes to the governments of the three Western powers that the Berlin issue is best resolved on the basis of fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on Germany. But this must be premised on the Western countries returning to the Potsdam Agreement, returning to the German policy jointly formulated with the Soviet Union. In this case, the issue arises of abolishing those decisions that violate the Potsdam Agreement, especially its military resolutions. Of course, these issues should be the subject of four-nation negotiations. Indeed, from all circumstances, the Western countries are now unwilling to abandon their adopted policy of turning West Germany into a major atomic and rocket base of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and into a militarist country. Now, the entire life of West Germany has been led onto the path of war and revanchism, although this path is a path to disaster for the German Federal Republic.

The Soviet Union strives to end the abnormal situation in Berlin, so it has suggested that the Western countries hold negotiations on giving West Berlin the status of a demilitarized free city. In addition to the principles I have put forward for regulating the status of the free city, all technical issues related to the complete elimination of the remnants of the Berlin occupation regime can also be the subject of negotiations. We are also prepared to study various explanations and amendments that the Western countries may propose.

I understand the second part of your question in this way: you assume that the Western countries may attempt to obstruct the elimination of the remnants of the Berlin occupation regime and do not believe that the Soviet Union has the right to transfer its temporary functions to the German Democratic Republic. If the Western countries refuse to give West Berlin the status of a free city, then there is no basis for negotiating with the Western countries on the Berlin issue. We reiterate that in order to implement the measures we have formulated regarding Berlin, we do not need any consent from the Western countries, and any insistence on their part in this regard cannot stop us. Another point is very clear, that is, the Soviet government will never betray the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and will not discuss with the three Western powers those parts of the German issue that can and should be resolved by the Germans themselves. We want to tell those who attempt to push us onto this path of interference: this attempt is in vain, it can only show how ignorant those who adopt this attempt are of the current situation in Germany, and how thick a fog has blinded their eyes.

If the West Stubbornly Refuses the Soviet Proposal
It Will Expose Their Intention to Prolong the Occupation

Q: What kind of actions by the Western countries do you think would undermine the Soviet proposal?

A: If the Western countries are truly willing to ease tensions in Europe and eliminate potential dangers, the best action they can take is to accept the Soviet proposal to transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. If the Western countries reject the Soviet proposal on the Berlin issue—this is the most they can do—they still cannot obstruct the implementation of those measures that the Soviet Union insists on eliminating the remnants of the Berlin occupation regime, which should be eliminated and can be eliminated. Not to mention, if the Western countries refuse to work with the Soviet Union to find a sensible basis for eliminating the Berlin occupation regime, they will expose their true face of attempting to prolong the occupation regime indefinitely in front of the German people, and not only in front of the German people.

Maintaining the occupation of West Berlin means maintaining, even inciting, the Cold War. The only explanation for maintaining this system is that the Western countries want to prepare for a hot war. There is no other explanation, nor can there be, because if the leaders of the countries concerned are truly willing to create normal conditions and eliminate all factors that breed the danger of war, then our proposal is the best thing possible. If other ways and means of eliminating tensions can be pointed out, we are very willing to consider and adopt them. But we believe that we have pointed out everything possible in detail in our proposals, and we hope that, sooner or later, those who are responsible for the fate of the world will understand that our proposals are timely and wise.

The Western countries have violated their obligations undertaken at the end of the war to eliminate aggressive German militarism. The Western countries are arming West Germany with atomic weapons, and the Soviet Union has nothing to do with this. If the Western countries do not accept our proposal to eliminate the dangerous source of trouble in West Berlin, it proves that their actions are to complete the arming of West Germany and prepare for a third world war as soon as possible. Therefore, we will more resolutely fight to eliminate the current situation in West Berlin.

Some hotheads in Western military circles have even issued such irresponsible arguments, saying that they will use troops and tanks to clear the way to Berlin. But isn't it obvious that this means war, because the other side also has tanks and other more powerful weapons that will not be put aside?

We do not believe that the West is willing to launch a war because of the Soviet proposal to eliminate the remnants of the Berlin occupation regime and because the German Democratic Republic obtains full sovereignty after the Soviet Union transfers its temporary functions to it. But if this situation regrettably happens, if the borders of the Elbe River are violated, and if the German Democratic Republic is invaded, then, as a faithful ally of the German Democratic Republic under the Warsaw Treaty, the Soviet Union will fulfill its obligations and defend the inviolability of its territory, territorial waters, and airspace together with the German Democratic Republic. Those who attempt to use force to ensure the occupation of territories belonging to another country, that is, those who attempt to undermine the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, shall bear full responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom. Therefore, the best way to solve the problem is not to treat war as child's play and to solve the Berlin issue according to the interests of our country's people and our future interests.

Those Who Advocate Nuclear Arming of West Germany
Are Committing a Crime, Whether Intentionally or Unintentionally

Q: What is your attitude towards the atomic arming of the German Federal Republic?

A: Those who advocate equipping the Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons are trying to make it appear that their measures in this regard are necessary to protect the German Federal Republic from some kind of "threat" from the East, and that these measures can strengthen the security of the German Federal Republic. It is not difficult to believe that this statement, to put it mildly, has nothing in common with the facts. Shouting about the "threat" from the Soviet Union is a deceptive act, the purpose of this shouting is to justify the measures to drag the German Federal Republic into the atomic and rocket arming race, as well as to incite hostility towards the Soviet Union among the residents of West Germany.

The Soviet Union has never waged a war of aggression, and such a war is incompatible with the nature of our country. The Soviet Union has not, and does not intend to, attack the German Federal Republic and any other country. The German Federal Republic's Minister of Defense Strauss recently scared the residents of West Germany by saying that there is currently a threat of a "local offensive" by the Soviet Union against the German Federal Republic. This is just a fallacy fabricated according to the wishes of revanchists and militarists. West Germany as a country will undoubtedly win the trust of the people of neighboring countries if those foolish strategists in the German Federal Republic who are still slandering peace-loving people and inciting revanchist frenzy among German residents can behave themselves.

The Soviet government fully agrees with the views of some people in West Germany who believe that nuclear weapons cannot be used as a tool to ensure the security of the German Federal Republic. Equipping the Bundeswehr with such weapons and deploying such weapons on the territory of West Germany are all making West Germany go further on the path of planning for war, thus containing the danger of destroying the German Federal Republic and causing millions of Germans to suffer. Only political blind people or ignorant people cannot see that those who determine the current military-political policy of the German Federal Republic are arranging a terrible future for this country.

We have the impression that those who advocate the nuclear arming of the German Federal Republic either do not fully understand what danger they are exposing the residents of West Germany to, or are doing so consciously. In either case, they are pushing the German Federal Republic onto the path of destruction, and are committing a crime.

When Negotiating the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty with Germany
Both German States Should Be Involved

Q: Do you still support the proposal to establish a confederation of the two German states?

A: The Soviet government has repeatedly stated that the reunification of Germany is an internal affair of the two German states. Only the Germans themselves can solve this problem, and this solution cannot be brought about or imposed by external forces.

It can only be surprising that some responsible officials in Western countries and the German Federal Republic say that Americans and Britons can solve the task of restoring German unity more easily than the Germans themselves. This does not mean that the great powers cannot play a certain role in promoting the reunification of Germany and promoting the rapprochement of the two German states. But, you know, Western countries do not want to promote this work, but want to prescribe a prescription for the Germans. This position of Western countries and the German Federal Republic on the issue of reunification is unrealistic.

Let's talk openly. You know, the people of the German Democratic Republic are building socialism, while the capitalist system is retained in the west of this country. Only those who are out of touch with reality would advocate the mechanical merger of two different countries. Holding this position makes it impossible to get the work of reunifying Germany out of the deadlock.

Starting from the current situation, taking into account the fact that there are two sovereign German states with different social systems and economic structures, the government of the German Democratic Republic has put forward a constructive plan to unify Germany by establishing a confederation. This proposition is increasingly stubbornly paving the way for itself. More and more broad strata of German residents are supporting this proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

You already know that the Soviet government fully supports the initiative of the German Democratic Republic. In the current situation, the establishment of a confederation is a reliable and realistic way to build a unified and democratic Germany. You undoubtedly also know that, although the proposal to establish a confederation opens up a bright prospect, Prime Minister Adenauer has refused to take this only realistic way to restore German unity. This once again proves that the West German ruling group's high-sounding talk about German unity is just a smokescreen, and in fact they are against this unity. What they need is not to truly restore national unity, but to talk about restoring unity only in words. In fact, Adenauer and his partners are afraid of restoring German unity, because building a unified, peaceful and democratic Germany would mean that their plan to turn West Germany into the main attacking force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive military bloc would go bankrupt, and their aggressive and revanchist plan would go bankrupt.

If the Federal Chancellor really cares about the reunification of the country, would he still act as a vanguard in the clamor for continuing the indefinite occupation of West Berlin? Why is he doing this? This is in no way for the benefit of the residents of West Berlin who are suffering under the occupation system, and certainly not to promote the easing of tensions and the establishment of normal relations between neighboring countries.

Take the issue of a peace treaty with Germany as another example. It is simply unbelievable: the head of government of one of the two existing German states is unwilling to sign a peace treaty through negotiations between the Soviet Union and the three Western countries—the main participants in the anti-Hitler alliance (and involving the two sovereign German states existing on German territory). Obviously, Prime Minister Adenauer, like his partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is seeking to conclude another peace treaty that actually aims to eliminate the German Democratic Republic. No one with a sound mind can imagine agreeing to do so. What is the basis for proposing to eliminate the German Democratic Republic, the first workers' and peasants' state in German history? If this is the case, then the Germans of the German Democratic Republic can also advocate eliminating the German Federal Republic and reunifying Germany on the basis of the socialist principles on which the German Democratic Republic is based. But it is clear that both of these ways of framing the issue are unrealistic. The only realistic possibility of solving the German issue once and for all is the road of peacefully resolving the German issue. There is no doubt that when concluding a peace treaty with Germany, the existence of the two German states must be taken into account, and they should be involved in the four-power negotiations. This is the wisest way to solve the problem, and this method will be welcomed by the people of all countries who long to ease tensions and ensure peace. If the Federal Chancellor insists on another path, then this means that he is pursuing another goal, not to ensure peace, and means that he is pursuing a dangerous policy of "strength." He wants to build an army and wants to arm it with atomic weapons, and he wants to pursue a policy of strength. From this, it can be seen that the policy pursued by Prime Minister Adenauer may lead to the collapse of West Germany, to the destruction of West Germany, because under the current conditions of modern weapons of mass destruction, war will be destructive in nature. This is of course appalling, but it is a fact. Therefore, we should not ignore this fact. We hope that the healthy patriotic forces in West Germany who care about their country's fate will understand this in a timely and correct manner and do everything possible to prevent the outbreak of a third world war.

    赫鲁晓夫就柏林问题答西德记者问
    柏林占领制度残余一定要消除
    西方国家任何阻挠都枉费心机
    新华社13日讯  塔斯社莫斯科12日电：德意志联邦共和国“南德意志报”首席记者乌耳里希·肯普斯基曾经请赫鲁晓夫回答若干问题。兹将赫鲁晓夫答肯普斯基问全文发表如下：
    西柏林应成为自由城市
    任何国家都不应干涉它
    问：您能否较详细地谈一谈西柏林自由城市的地位？
    答：苏联政府关于消灭柏林占领制度残余和变西柏林为独立的政治单位——非军事化自由城市的建议描绘出了西柏林将来的面貌。我们认为，西柏林应当成为自由城市，任何国家，包括现有的两个德国在内，都不应该干涉它的经济和政治生活。西柏林自由城市应当有自己的以民主原则为基础的宪法。这个宪法应当保证西柏林的全体公民，不分政治和宗教信仰，都有基本的人权和基本的自由，包括言论出版自由、集会结社自由、宗教信仰自由。立法权将由居民自由选举的议会行使，行政权由议会任命的政府行使。这个城市还将有自己的独立的诉讼程序。
    西柏林自由城市在经济上将是一个整体，有自己的预算、银行、货币流通和纳税制度。税收将全部纳入城市预算，西柏林纳税者再也不必为德意志联邦共和国的备战活动和西柏林外国占领军的费用掏腰包。经过适当协商，西柏林各企业的工业产品可以输送到德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国，也可以输送到同自由城市有商业联系的任何其他国家，而不受任何限制。还可以发展同东西方各国的全面互利的经济联系来保证城市的经济稳定和高涨。苏联方面准备给自由城市的企业提供订货和原料，使居民得以全部就业并且使经济健康稳定。
    苏联政府建议西柏林非军事化，并且在西柏林境内没有任何外国武装部队。当然，为了维持自由城市的公共秩序，自由城市将拥有必要的警察部队。有些主张保持占领柏林制度的人现在硬说，如果西方三国军队撤出西柏林，这个城市就会失去保护。我们抱有恰恰相反的看法：只有西柏林的街道上没有美国的坦克和英国的大炮并且变成自由城市，西柏林才能造成安全的环境，保障应有的安全。未必能有比四个大国和两个德国所应承担的义务能更好地提供保障西柏林的安全的保证，如果有必要的话，这些义务——保证可以在联合国中明文规定。苏联和德意志民主共和国愿意提出保证，保障自由城市的地位。只有西方国家目前还拒绝这一点。
    割除西柏林这个恶性毒瘤
    将是改善欧洲局势的开端
    试问：对未来自由城市的地位的威胁来自何方——来自东方，还是来自西方？在这方面不能不指出，无中生有地说德意志民主共和国有什么夺取西柏林的计划这种论调是十分荒谬的。如果真的有这种计划，那么，作为德意志民主共和国华沙条约盟国的苏联就不会提出给予西柏林以自由城市地位的建议，也不会表示愿意共同保障它的安全，这不是很明白吗？不但如此，德意志民主共和国为了缓和德国和欧洲的紧张局势，宁愿作不小的牺牲，同意在共和国的中心存在一个自由城市并且保障这个城市可以同东方和西方畅通无阻地往来。
    有人高谈西方国家在西柏林驻一定数目的军队是为了保持柏林目前局面所必需的，这种人应当学会现实地估计目前的局势。事实上，如果有原因造成需要用武力解决柏林问题时，在具有现代化战争手段的情况下，在西柏林留驻一定数目的军队未必是什么不可克服的障碍。相反，这些军队留驻柏林恰恰造成一种“毒瘤”，使全体爱好和平的人民，首先是德国人民自己，感到不安，因为这个毒瘤的发展可能导致纠纷，继而可能导致公开的武装冲突。因此我们建议割除这个恶性毒瘤，以便创造条件，使欧洲的紧张局势不但不会加深，反而会化为乌有，并且保障一种有利于和平共处的环境。实现我们的建议，将是澄清和改善欧洲局势和消除柏林的这种策源地的开端。
    在具有应有的相互谅解和良好关系的情况下，就可以为解决其他更复杂的问题，特别是撤军问题，创造有利条件，以便使两个对立的军事集团的武装部队不直接接触，这样一来，就会造成一个武装部队隔离区。在西方国家同意减少它们在西德的驻军的情况下，我们这方面准备减少我们在德意志民主共和国的驻军。我们甚至准备把我们的暂时驻扎在欧洲各国境内的军队全部撤回本国，如果西方国家也这样做的话。如果我们的这些建议被接受，我们愿意对减少和从两个德国撤出外国军队建立监督。外国军队撤出德国的好处难道还用得着证明吗？我相信，这个步骤会使德国人民大松一口气。
    某些贫嘴贱舌的人十分愚蠢
    竟瞎说苏联打算夺取西柏林
    谈到这里，我想答复一下某些贫嘴贱舌的人，他们瞎说什么苏联打算夺取西柏林。他们的这种议论是完全愚蠢的。只有那些企图千方百计保持现有紧张局势的人才会发出这种论调，而我们则致力于为消除“冷战”创造条件，致力于造成一种不会毒化各大国（并且不仅仅是各大国）间的关系的气氛。我们真心诚意地力求驱散有些人准备第三次世界大战的阴云霾雾。两个德国的德国人在战争中、特别是在最近一次的战争中遭受了巨大的人力物力牺牲，因此，他们比任何人都更清楚地了解战争意味着什么。他们饱尝战争之苦，我毫不怀疑，他们是反对准备第三次世界大战。实现苏联的建议，就能创造良好的条件，来更合理地使用物力和财力，使各国预算不再耗费在军事项目上，就可能用这些钱来提高人民的生活水平。
    西柏林自由城市的地位不使西柏林和它的居民承担任何负担很重的义务。我们只提出一点：西柏林不容许在自己境内对任何外国，首先是对德意志民主共和国进行敌对的颠复活动和宣传。同样，由此得到好处的也首先是这个城市的居民，因为他们违背自己的愿望陷入各种特务颠复组织，并且使自己的生命受到严重的威胁。这就是我们认为在准备西柏林自由城市地位的讨论时可以采纳的某些考虑。当然，这个问题还需要仔细研究，德国人自己可以对这件事作出很大贡献。在讨论把西柏林变成非军事化自由城市的问题时，苏联自然准备提出更加详细的关于自由城市地位的规定。
    要苏联干涉德国内政的人
    是浓厚的大雾遮住了眼睛
    问：苏联政府认为，哪些有关西柏林地位的问题可以成为四大国谈判的内务，哪些问题不应当讨论？
    答：苏联政府在给西方三国政府的照会中已经说过，柏林问题最好是在履行关于德国的波茨坦协定的基础上来求得解决。但这必须以西方国家回到波茨坦协定，回到和苏联共同拟定的对德政策为前提。在这种情况下，就出现了废除那些破坏波茨坦协定、首先是破坏它的军事决议的决定的问题。当然，这些问题应当成为四国谈判的内容。的确，从各方面情况看来，西方国家现在不愿意放弃它们所采取的变西德为北大西洋公约组织主要原子和火箭基地和变为军国主义国家的方针，现在西德的全部生活已经被引上战争和复仇主义的道路，尽管这条道路对德意志联邦共和国来说是一条通向灾难的道路。
    苏联力求结束柏林的不正常的局势，所以曾经建议西方国家举行关于给西柏林以非军事化自由城市地位的谈判。除了我所提出的规定自由城市地位的原则以外，有关彻底消灭柏林占领制度残余的所有技术问题也可以成为谈判的内容。我们也准备研究西方国家可能提出的各种说明和修正。
    我对您的问题的第二部分是这样理解的：您假定西方国家可能企图阻挠消灭柏林占领制度的残余并且不认为苏联有权把它的暂行职能交给德意志民主共和国。如果西方国家拒绝给西柏林以自由城市的地位，那就没有同西方国家就柏林问题进行谈判的任何基础。我们再一次声明，为了实现我们所拟定的关于柏林的措施，我们不需要西方国家的任何同意，它们在这方面的任何强求都不能阻止我们。还有一点十分清楚，就是苏联政府决不背弃不干涉他国内政的原则，并且也不会同西方三国讨论德国问题中那些可能和应当由德国人自己解决的部分。我们要告诉那些企图把我们推上这种干涉的道路的人：这种企图是枉费心机，它只能表明那些采取这种企图的人对于德国现状是多么无知，多么浓厚的大雾遮住了他们的眼睛。
    如果西方顽固拒绝苏联建议
    将暴露它们延长占领的面目
    问：您认为西方国家什么样的行动是破坏苏联的建议？
    答：如果西方国家真正愿意缓和欧洲紧张局势和消灭潜在的危险的话，它们所能采取的最好行动就是接受苏联关于变西柏林为非军事化自由城市的建议。如果西方国家拒绝苏联关于柏林问题的建议——这是它们顶多能做到的事——它们也仍然不能阻挠那些为苏联所坚持消灭柏林占领制度残余的措施的实现，这些残余应当消除而且能够消除。更不用说，如果西方国家拒绝同苏联一道寻找明智的基础来消灭柏林占领制度，它们就会在德国人民面前，而且不仅仅是在德国人民面前，暴露出企图无限期延长占领制度的本来面目。
    保持对西柏林的占领，就意味着保持、甚至是煽动冷战。保持这种制度唯一的解释是：西方国家想准备进行热战。另外的解释没有也不可能有，因为，与此有关的各国的领导人如果真正愿意创造正常的条件和消除一切孕育着战争危险的因素，那末我们的建议就是最好不过的东西了。如果能够指出其他消灭紧张局势的途径和办法，我们很愿意考虑和采纳。但是我们认为，我们在建议中详细地指出了一切可能的东西，并且希望，不是今天就是明天，对世界的命运负有责任的人会明白我们的建议是适时和明智的。
    西方国家破坏了它们在战争末期所承担的消灭侵略性的德国军国主义的义务。西方国家用原子武器武装西德，苏联同这件事毫无关系。如果西方国家不接受我们关于消灭西柏林危险策源地的建议，那就证明，它们的行动是为了尽快地完成武装西德和准备第三次世界大战。因此我们将更加坚决地争取消除西柏林的目前局势。
    西方军界中某些头脑发热的人甚至发出这样的不负责任的论调，说什么要用军队和坦克来扫清通向柏林的道路。但是这难道不明显，这就意味着战争，因为另一方也有坦克和其他更强有力的武器，不会搁置不用的。
    我们不相信西方由于苏联建议消除柏林占领制度的残余和由于德意志民主共和国在苏联把暂行职能交给它以后得到充分主权而愿意发动战争。但假如这种情况竟令人遗憾地发生了的话，假如易北河的疆界遭到破坏，德意志民主共和国遭到侵略的话，那么，作为德意志民主共和国华沙条约的忠实盟国，苏联将履行自己的义务，同德意志民主共和国一道保卫它的领土、领水和领空的不可侵犯性。对由此而产生的后果，应由那些企图用武力来保证对属于另一个国家的领土的霸占，也就是企图破坏德意志民主共和国主权的人承担全部责任。因此，解决问题的最好办法是不要再把战争当作儿戏而根据我们国家的人民的利益和我们将来的利益来解决柏林问题。
    为西德核武装鼓吹的人
    不论有意无意都是犯罪
    问：您对德意志联邦共和国的原子武装抱什么态度？
    答：主张用核武器和火箭武器装备联邦国防军的人，企图把情况说成是：他们在这方面采取措施是保卫德意志联邦共和国免遭来自东方的某种“威胁”所必需的，而且这些措施能加强德意志联邦共和国的安全。不难相信，这种说法，客气点说，同事实没有丝毫共同之点。叫嚷来自苏联的“威胁”，这是一种欺骗行为，这种叫嚷的目的是要为把德意志联邦共和国拖入原子武装和火箭武装竞赛的措施辩解，以及煽动西德居民对苏联的敌意。
    苏联从来就没有进行过侵略战争，这种战争与我们国家的本质是格格不入的。苏联过去没有，现在也不打算进攻德意志联邦共和国和任何其他国家。德意志联邦共和国国防部长施特劳斯不久前吓唬西德居民说，目前存在着苏联对德意志联邦共和国实行“局部进攻”的威胁，这只是根据复仇主义分子和军国主义分子的愿望捏造出来的谬论。西德作为一个国家无疑会赢得邻邦人民对自己的信任，如果德意志联邦共和国的那些现在仍然在诽谤爱好和平人民和在德国居民中间煽动复仇主义狂热的愚蠢战略家能够规规矩矩的话。
    苏联政府完全赞同某些西德人士的意见，这些人士认为，核武器不可能作为保证德意志联邦共和国安全的工具，以这种武器装备联邦国防军，在西德领土上配置这种武器，所有这些都使得西德在策划战争的道路上走得更远，因而包含着毁灭德意志联邦共和国和使千千万万德国人遭受牺牲的危险。只有政治盲人或无知者才看不到那些决定德意志联邦共和国当前军事政治方针的人正在为这个国家安排一个可怕的前途。
    我们有这样一种印象：那些为德意志联邦共和国的核武装鼓吹的人，不是没有完全理解到他们在使西德居民遭受到什么样的危险，就是有意识地这么做的。无论是哪一种情况，他们都是把德意志联邦共和国推向毁灭的道路，都是犯罪。
    在谈判缔结对德和约时
    应当吸收两个德国参加
    问：您是否仍支持建立两个德国的邦联的建议？
    答：苏联政府已一再声明，恢复德国统一是两个德国的内部事情。只有德国人自己才能解决这个问题，这种解决不是能由外力带来或强加的。
    西方国家和德意志联邦共和国的一些负责官方人士说，美国人和英国人比德国人自己更容易解决恢复德国统一的任务，这种说法只能令人感到惊讶。这决不意味着，大国不能在恢复统一德国方面起一定的作用，促使两个德国接近。但是，要知道，西方国家不想促进这项工作，而想给德国人开处方。西方国家和德意志联邦共和国在恢复统一问题上的这种立场是不现实的。
    我们开诚布公地谈谈。要知道，德意志民主共和国人民正在建设社会主义，而这个国家的西部则保留着资本主义制度。只有那些脱离实际的人才会主张两个不同国家的机械合并。持有这种立场，就无法使重新统一德国的工作摆脱僵局。
    德意志民主共和国政府从当前的局势出发，考虑到存在着不同社会制度和经济结构的两个主权德国这一事实，提出了通过成立邦联来统一德国的建设性方案。这种主张日益顽强地给自己开辟着道路。越来越多的广大德国居民阶层拥护德意志民主共和国政府的这个建议。
    你们已经知道，苏联政府完全支持德意志民主共和国的倡议，在现在的局势下，建立邦联乃是建立一个统一、民主的德国的可靠的、现实的途径。你们无疑也知道，尽管关于建立邦联的建议开辟了美好的前景，可是阿登纳总理却拒绝恢复德国统一的这条唯一现实的途径。这再一次证明，西德统治集团高谈德国统一问题只是为了转移视线，而事实上他们是反对这种统一的。他们需要的不是真正恢复国家统一，而只不过是在口头上谈谈恢复统一而已。事实上，阿登纳和他的伙伴们害怕恢复德国统一，因为建成一个统一、和平民主的德国，就意味着他们的把西德变为北大西洋公约组织侵略性军事集团的主要攻击力量的计划破产，就意味着他们的侵略、复仇计划的破产。
    如果联邦总理真的关心国家的恢复统一，难道他还会在主张继续无限期占领西柏林的喧嚣中充当急先锋？他这样做是为了什么呢？这无论如何也不是为了忍受着占领制度的西柏林居民的利益，当然也不是为了促进缓和紧张局势和建立邻国间的正常关系。
    再举对德和约问题为例。简直令人难以置信：现存的两个德国之一的政府首脑不愿意通过苏联和三个西方国家——反希特勒同盟主要参加者之间的谈判（并吸收德国领土上现存的两个主权德国）来签订和约。显然，阿登纳总理，就像他的北大西洋公约组织的伙伴一样，谋求缔结另一种实际上是要消灭德意志民主共和国的和约。任何一个思想健全的人也不能设想会同意这样做。提出消灭德国历史上第一个工农国家德意志民主共和国的问题，有什么根据呢？如果是这样，那么德意志民主共和国的德国人也可以主张消灭德意志联邦共和国并在德意志民主共和国所依据的社会主义原则的基础上重新统一德国。但是很明显，对问题的这两种提法都是不现实的。一劳永逸地解决德国问题的唯一现实的可能性就是和平解决德国问题的道路。毫无疑问，在缔结对德和约时，必须考虑到两个德国的存在，应当吸收它们参加四大国谈判。这是解决问题的最明智的方法，这种方法将受到渴望缓和紧张局势和保障和平的各国人民的欢迎。如果联邦总理坚持另一条道路，那么这就意味着，他追求着另一种目的，而不是为了保障和平，并且意味着，他奉行危险的“实力地位”政策。他想要建立军队，并要用原子武器来武装它，他想要奉行实力政策。由此可见，阿登纳总理所奉行的政策可能导致西德的崩溃、导致西德的毁灭，因为在拥有现代化大规模毁灭性武器的目前条件下，战争会带有毁灭的性质。这当然是骇人闻听的，但是这是事实。因此，我们不应该无视这个事实。我们希望西德的、关心本国命运的健康的爱国力量及时地、正确地了解这一点并尽一切努力来阻止第三次世界大战的爆发。
