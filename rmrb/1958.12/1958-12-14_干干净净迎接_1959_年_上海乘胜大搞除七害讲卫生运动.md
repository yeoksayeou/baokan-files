According to the Liberation Daily, the broad masses of Shanghai are taking advantage of the victory to fiercely attack the "seven pests," determined to clean up thoroughly to welcome the New Year of 1959.

Many units in the rural suburbs of Shanghai have recently unified their production and patriotic health campaigns. The members of the people's communes are in high spirits, striving for good production and good hygiene. The Second Platoon of the Second Battalion of the Donghai People's Commune in Baoshan County is the best platoon in the entire commune in eliminating the "seven pests." The members are making leaps forward in both production and hygiene, having cleared a total of 1,900 loads of garbage and weeds, while also solving the fertilizer problem for more than 700 mu of rapeseed fields.

Since the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee put forward the decision to ensure that workers get enough sleep and rest, many factories have taken measures to strengthen the leadership of sanitation work. The original hygiene situation of State-owned No. 2 Machinery Factory was relatively poor, but after a month of hard work, the hygienic appearance has been basically changed. Under the leadership of the branch secretary and the workshop director, all the workers in the First and Second Workshops of the Xinlu Steel Plant have taken the same drive in eliminating the "seven pests" as they do in production, turning the workshops, which used to be full of garbage and all kinds of pests, into clean and tidy spaces.

After many districts reached the pest elimination appraisal standards promulgated by the Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, they made further plans to consolidate their achievements. The residents of Luwan District are full of energy, repeatedly inspecting and making up for deficiencies, eliminating dead corners. In order to keep track of households and units with "seven pests", the entire district conducted two comprehensive general inspections in a row, and on the basis of pest elimination, further strengthened street cleaning, maintained clean roads, implemented the "three sweeps" (sweeping the sidewalk in front of the door in the morning, noon and evening), "three checks" (checking in the morning, noon, and evening), "two controls" (managing spittoons and waste bins), and "two flushes" (flushing the gutter covers twice a day) system, and organized cleaning groups, with the group leaders responsible for inspection and supervision. Hongkou District is further investigating the breeding grounds in the entire district, and at present, all the various sectors are checking and comparing each other, preparing to welcome the national hygiene competition.

Recently, the city has begun to prepare intensively for the battle to eliminate sparrows.

    干干净净迎接1959年
    上海乘胜大搞除七害讲卫生运动
    据解放日报消息  上海市广大群众，正在乘胜猛攻七害，决心打扫得干干净净迎接1959年新年。
    上海郊区农村许多单位最近把生产和爱国卫生运动作了统一安排。各人民公社的社员们精神焕发，力争生产好、卫生好。宝山县东海人民公社二营二连一排是整个公社中除七害最好的一个排，社员们生产、卫生双跃进，他们清除垃圾、杂草共一千九百担，同时也解决了七百多亩油菜田的肥料问题。
    自从上海市委提出保证工人睡足歇好的决定后，许多工厂都采取措施，加强对卫生工作的领导。国营二机原来卫生情况较差，通过苦战一月，现在卫生面貌已基本改变。新沪钢铁厂一、二车间全体工人在支部书记和车间主任的领导下，拿出搞生产的干劲来除七害，把过去垃圾成堆、五害俱全的车间搞得干干净净，整整齐齐。
    不少区在达到上海市爱国卫生运动委员会颁布的除害鉴定标准以后，为巩固成绩，又作了进一步打算。卢湾区居民干劲十足，反复检查，突击补课，消灭死角。全区为了掌握有七害户和有七害单位，连续进行了二次全面性普遍检查，并在除害的基础上进一步加强地段保洁，保持路面整洁，贯彻三扫（早、中、晚自扫门前人行道），三查（早、中、晚检查），二管（管痰盂、管废物箱），二冲洗（每日二次冲洗阴沟盖）的制度，并编好保洁小组，由小组长负责检查督促。虹口区把全区的孳生地再进一步调查，目前各条条块块都在相互对口检查、评比，迎接全国卫生大评比。
    近日，全市开始紧张准备，迎接消灭麻雀的战斗。
