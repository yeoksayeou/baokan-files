Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 1st. Dehui County, Jilin Province, has launched mass sports activities in conjunction with production, resulting in a great leap forward in sports work. It was recently awarded the title of "Provincial Sports Red Banner County" by the Jilin Provincial Sports Commission.

At present, more than 40,000 people in the county have reached various levels of the Labor and Defense System standards, an average of one out of every eleven people. All eligible students in more than 200 middle and primary schools in the county have passed the Labor and Defense System. Among the farmers in twelve townships, more than 12,000 people have reached various levels of the Labor and Defense System standards. The county has more than 12,000 athletes of various grades, ranking first in the province in terms of population ratio.

Closely integrating with production and serving production is an important reason for the great leap forward in sports in Dehui County. The masses regard physical exercise as an indispensable part of their daily lives, and their slogan is: "Wherever labor goes, sports follow," "Fields and construction sites are our playgrounds." During the intense autumn harvest and deep plowing campaigns, farmers in various townships also brought some simple sports equipment, such as basketballs, volleyballs, footballs, hand grenades, and ropes, to the fields, using rest time for physical exercise and Labor and Defense System tests. The vigorous development of sports activities has promoted the improvement of labor efficiency. Sanhe Township is very active in sports, and the quality and quantity of deep plowing are also the best in the county.

The fundamental method for carrying out sports activities in Dehui County is to launch mass movements and implement the mass line. The county uses newspapers, radio, and various meetings to publicize the importance of carrying out mass sports activities to the broad masses. Because the masses are fully mobilized, many problems are quickly resolved. If there are no venues, the masses build them themselves; if there is no equipment, the masses make it themselves; if there is a lack of technical guidance, the "able are teachers" method is adopted, and people with higher sports technical skills are selected from the masses to serve as instructors. In this way, sports activities have been popularized in every corner of the county.

    体育运动普及到每个角落
    德惠成为体育红旗县
    新华社长春1日电  吉林省德惠县结合生产开展全民体育运动，出现了体育工作大跃进的局面，最近获得了吉林省体委授予的“全省体育运动红旗县”的称号。
    目前这个县已有四万多人分别达到劳卫制各级标准，平均十一人中就有一人合格。全县二百多所中学和小学的适龄学生已全部通过劳卫制。在十二个乡的农民群众中，有一万二千多人分别达到劳卫制各级标准。全县已有等级运动员一万二千多人，按人口比例计算，占全省第一位。
    紧密结合生产，服务于生产，是德惠县体育运动出现大跃进局面的一个重要原因。群众把体育锻炼当成日常生活中不可少的一部分，他们的口号是：“劳动到哪里，体育跟到哪里”、“田间、工地当操场”。各乡农民在紧张的秋收和深翻运动中，也把一些简易体育器材，如篮球、排球、足球，手榴弹、绳子等带到田间，利用休息时间进行体育锻炼和劳卫制测验。体育活动的蓬勃开展，促进了劳动效率的提高。三合乡体育运动很活跃，深翻地的质量和数量也是全县最好的一个。
    德惠县开展体育运动的根本方法是大搞群众运动，贯彻群众路线。全县通过报纸、广播和各种会议，向广大群众宣传开展全民体育运动的重要性。由于群众发动得比较充分，许多问题都迅速解决。没有场地，群众就自己动手修建，没有器材群众就自己动手制作，缺乏技术指导力量，就采取“能者为师”办法，选拔群众中体育技术水平较高的人充当教员。这样，就使体育运动普及到全县的每一个角落。
