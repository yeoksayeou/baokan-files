A Trip Through Guizhou and Sichuan (and an extra chapter)
    Chen Ge

    The car bumped along, driving from Guangxi into Guizhou. The gray sky was always low, pressing down overhead, occasionally mixed with a drizzle. All around were layer upon layer of mountains that seemed to stretch endlessly, and roads that twisted and turned. In the mountain dams on both sides of the winding road, you could see a few or dozens of thatched houses. People hoeing, plowing, and leading oxen to deep-plow the fields were everywhere, stubbornly digging down two feet into the mountain, turning up red, crushed stone powder and mixing it with fertilizer. North of Zunyi, in the Heishenmiao area, you could see entire tall, barren mountaintops that had been turned over, with eye-catching large characters carved into the mountainside: "Youth Sweet Potato Mountain."

    Driving on the Guizhou plateau is indeed as difficult as ascending to the heavens. The road is carved out of the mountains, with the car half-hugging the mountainside and half-overhanging deep valleys. Climbing up, climbing down, steep turns one after another. When crossing the Wujiang River, half of the route is along cliffs tens of feet high, and the other half is along the turbulent, light-blue Wujiang River below cliffs several feet high. It's both beautiful and dangerous, and you travel along the river for about an hour before climbing up the mountain on the opposite bank of the Wujiang River, where the Wujiang River disappears behind the mountains. Traveling from Zunyi to Ganshuidui in Sichuan, not far past Heishenmiao, you see two high mountains sandwiching a small road full of steep turns, which is the famous Lou Mountain Pass from the Long March. Driving on this Jinding Mountain, passing through Tongzi, you reach the notoriously dangerous Seventy-Two Bends. The car twists and turns uphill, with clouds and mist swirling all the way. Reaching the summit, it twists and turns downhill again. Arriving at Chongshui Creek north of Songkan, a bridge spans the creek. This side of the bridge is Guizhou, and the other side is Sichuan.

    Those who travel through Guizhou and Sichuan for the first time are nervous and apprehensive. The drivers, however, are calm and composed, as if driving on a flat highway. It's hard to find a car without a red plaque or certificate of merit. A red plaque on the front of the car reads: "Safe Driving for 250,000 Kilometers." Inside the car, there's a certificate of merit or a report of good news. Some cars have one, two, or even three "satellites" pasted on the driver's window, some of which boast daily mileage as high as 360 kilometers. The drivers, especially on the Duyun-Guiyang line, take turns. One drives, the engine roaring; the other curls up in bed next to the driver and sleeps. He drives during the day, he drives at night, working around the clock to ensure the smooth flow of the steel transportation line. Some passengers find the driver sleeping under the covers amusing and say, "You're really something." The driver replies from under the covers, "If you were sleepy, you could fall asleep too."

    Looking out the window, the peaks reach the sky, and below are deep valleys, with pedestrians in the valley floor looking like tiny ants. The car rushes up, rushes down, turns sharply, and speeds along with a bump. Looking at these tireless drivers, the passengers' hearts are filled with warmth, and they truly want to sing the praises of these heroic people!

      Night Crossing of the Three Gorges

    The boat passed Fengjie at exactly four o'clock in the morning. High mountains on both sides enclose the turbulent Yangtze River, sending the boat straight into the Qutang Gorge. Two steep, tall, barren peaks sandwich the boat, with the gap between the two walls not even as wide as the bridge hole of a Yangtze River bridge. The situation is similar at Wu Mountain. However, the mountains are higher, and the river is wider. As for the Bingshu Baojian Gorge and the Niugan Mafei Gorge, they are merely oddly shaped steep cliffs along the river and are not particularly dangerous. The most treacherous part is the Qingtan Rapids, where large whirlpools are nested together. Large boats can manage, but small boats with lone sails spin along with the whirlpools, surging up one whirlpool, falling into another, and then climbing up the third whirlpool like an arrow. As long as the rudder doesn't break, the experienced boatmen are confident in navigating this series of whirlpools; if the rudder breaks, the boat will spin into the bottom of the vortex, fall into the heart of the river, and may even land squarely on a mountain peak on the riverbed. The danger of Qingtan is most clearly visible because, by the time the boat reaches this point, it's already seven o'clock in the morning, and golden light slants into the river from the steep peak on the right, turning the river water golden yellow.

    Night crossings of the Three Gorges have a unique flavor. All around are dark, strangely shaped, and treacherous peaks, and below is the shiny black river water. The two large headlights on the bow sweep across the river surface, each eye seeing for tens of miles. The vast waves, mixed with the roar of the engine, keep the pilot at the bow constantly calling out, "To the left, to the left," repeating this throughout the night without rest. On both sides of the boat are red and yellow lights, which are navigation markers. The navigation markers are located on the sharp corners where the river turns and the mountain meets the river, on the protruding points of dangerous shoals, and also on the mountains. The navigation markers on the mountains have three lights: red, blue, and yellow. When there are no boats on the river surface on that side of the mountain, all three lights are on. Once a boat has passed, the red and blue lights are extinguished, leaving only the yellow light suspended on the cliff. If a navigation marker light is not visible, the boat sounds several long blasts of its horn from afar, piercing the night sky. As it gets closer, you can see a small boat braving the raging waves, heading towards the extinguished navigation marker. The searchlight on the bow illuminates a person there, lighting the lamp. If it can't be lit, the person guarding the navigation marker at night holds two lanterns high, standing on the bow of the small boat at the navigation marker, waiting for the boat to pass. Where is the home of the person who guards the navigation marker at night? Searching among the dark and dangerous peaks, a light is revealed in the middle of a dangerous peak, and a small house can be faintly seen. That is his home. It is they who dredge the waterways with iron rakes during the day, and use iron hammers to measure the depth of the river water, nailing down the navigation markers one by one; and when the pitch-black night comes, they move the stars from the sky to the river surface, allowing the ships of the world to sail safely in the Milky Way.

    黔川行（外一章）
    辰戈
    车儿颠颠地，从广西开进贵州。灰色的天总是低低地照头上压来，偶尔夹杂着丝丝细雨。前后左右都是望也望不出去的重重叠叠的山，曲曲弯弯的路。曲路两旁的山坝里，可以看见几户或几十户茅屋人家。荷锄、扶犁、牵牛去深翻地的人满坝都是，硬把山刨下二尺，翻出红色的碎石粉来，拌上肥料。在遵义以北，黑神庙一带，可以看到整个高高的荒山头都翻了个，惹人注目的大字刻在山上：“青年红苕山”。
    车在贵州高原上行驶的确难如上青天。本是削山为路，车半傍山，半临深谷。爬上，爬下，陡弯接连不断。过乌江时，半是数十丈高的绝壁，半是数丈绝壁下淡蓝色的湍急的乌江，又美，又险，伴江而行约有一个小时的时间，才爬上乌江对岸的山上，乌江为山隐没了。由遵义往四川的赶水走，过黑神庙不远，见两座高山夹住一条又小又尽是陡弯的路，这就是长征时有名的娄山关。在这金顶山上走，过桐梓，就到了名险七十二拐。车儿拐拐上山，一路云雾缠绕。到了山顶，又拐拐而下。到了松坎北的崇水溪，溪上驾着一座桥，桥这端属贵州，桥那端便是四川了。
    初行黔川的人，一路提心吊胆，捏把汗。驾车的司机却从容沉着，如行平坦的公路。哪个汽车上没有红牌牌、奖状，的确难以找到。车前一个红牌：“安全行车二十五万公里”。车里一面奖状或一面喜报。有的车儿，驾驶员的玻璃窗上贴着一个、两个、三个卫星，上面有的高达日行三百六十公里。车里的司机，特别是由都匀到贵阳一线，一个在开车，马达轰隆隆地山响；另一个在司机旁搭上小床缩在被子里睡觉。白天他开，晚上他开，连轴转，保证钢铁运输线畅通无阻。有的旅客见蒙头睡觉的司机很好笑，道：“你真有本事。”司机在被里道：“你要困了，一样能睡着。”
    望望车外，高峰接天，下是深谷，谷底行人像小蚂蚁一样。车儿急上，急下，陡转，颠颠地飞奔。再望望这些不知疲倦的司机，乘客的心里热呼呼的，真想大声地歌颂这些英雄的人们！
      三峡夜渡
    船过奉节正是清晨四点钟。两岸高山夹着湍急的长江，把船儿直送进夔门。黑黑的两座又陡又高的枯峰夹住船，两壁之间还没有长江大桥的桥洞大。巫山那儿，也是如此。不过，山更高些，江也宽些。至于兵书宝剑峡，牛肝马肺峡，只是夹江陡壁奇形怪状，并不十分险。最险恶的要数青滩，一个大漩涡一个大漩涡套在一起。大船行此还好，小船孤帆顺漩涡而转，冲上一个漩涡，又落入一个漩涡，再又箭似地爬上第三个漩涡。只要舵不断，饱经风险的船夫是有把握通过这一系列漩涡的；舵若断了，船儿就转进涡底，落进江心，也可能正好安放在江底的山峰上。青滩之险，看得最清，因为船到这里，已清晨七时，金光由右面陡峰斜泻入江，江水也成金黄色了。
    三峡夜渡，别有风味。四周都是黑漆漆的奇形怪状的险峰，下面是黑得发亮的江水。船头两只大眼睛横扫江面，两只眼睛一看十数里。波涛万顷，夹杂着马达的轰鸣，引水员在船头上不停地叨唠：“向左，向左。”整整叨唠一通夜没歇气。船儿两侧，都是红色的黄色的灯，这就是航标。航标在江转山角的角尖上有，在险滩突出点上有，在山上也有。山上的航标，红蓝黄三个灯，山那面江面没船，三个灯都是亮的，等船过了，红的蓝的灯熄了，只有黄灯悬在绝壁上。要是有个航标灯看不见了，离得老远，船上汽笛几声长鸣，撕破夜空。待走得近了，可见到小船儿冲破惊涛骇浪，到那熄了灯的航标那里。船头的探照灯照见一个人在那儿点灯，要是没点着，那夜里守望航标的人就用手高举两个灯笼，站在航标那儿的小船船头，等着船儿过去。夜守航标的人，他的家在哪儿，搜寻一下黑漆漆的危峰，那危峰腰部露出灯光，隐绰绰见到一幢小房子，这就是他的家。就是他们，白天用铁耙疏通航道，用铁锤测定江水深度，把一个个航标钉好；而到了漆黑的夜晚，他们又把天上的繁星搬到江面，让人间的船儿在银河里安全的航行。
