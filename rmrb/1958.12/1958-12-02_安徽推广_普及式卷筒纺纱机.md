    Anhui Promotes Popularized Roller Spinning Machine
    (By Our Newspaper) Anhui Province is vigorously promoting popularized roller spinning machines, planning to develop 300,000 native yarn spindles in people's communes throughout the province. As of early November, according to statistics from five special districts and three cities, more than 15,000 native yarn spindles have already been manufactured, of which more than 6,900 spindles have been officially put into production. After all 300,000 native yarn spindles are put into production, the annual yarn output will reach more than 90,000 pieces; if the technology is improved, the output can be further increased.
    The native yarn spindles that have been put into production in various places generally perform well. The spun yarn meets the quality requirements and has been made into jacquard bedsheets, coarse cloth, gloves, and towels.
    The popularized roller spinning machine was finalized by the Nantong City Waste Yarn Factory in Jiangsu Province. This machine has a simple structure, is easy to manufacture, and the operating technology is easy to master. The requirements for spinning raw materials are not high, and raw cotton, waste cotton, old cotton wadding, miscellaneous stalk fibers, and wild fibers can be used. This spinning machine can be driven by electricity, animal power, or manual and foot pedaling. It is very convenient for people's communes to promote this type of spinning machine.

    安徽推广  普及式卷筒纺纱机
    本报讯  安徽省正在大力推广普及式卷筒纺纱机，计划在全省人民公社发展三十万土纱锭。截至11月上旬，据五个专区和三个市的统计，就已经制成一万五千多土纱锭，其中有六千九百多锭已正式投入生产。三十万土纱锭全部投入生产以后，年产纱量将达九万多件；从技术上加以改进，产量还可以提高。
    各地已经投入生产的土纱锭，一般性能良好。织出的纱，质量符合要求，并已制成提花被单、粗布、手套和毛巾等产品。
    普及式卷筒纺纱机是由江苏省南通市回纱厂研究定型的。这种机器结构简单，容易制造，操作技术易于掌握。纺纱原料要求不高，原棉、废棉、旧棉絮杂秆纤维和野生纤维都能用。这种纺纱机用电力、畜力和手摇、脚踏都可以带动。人民公社推广这种纺纱机很方便。
