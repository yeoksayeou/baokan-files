    After Eating in the Canteen

    An important experience in consolidating people's commune canteens in Yingcheng County is that cadres have abolished their "small stoves" and eat in the public canteen. Because after the cadres eat in the canteen, they can discover problems and solve them.

    Many cadres in the people's communes are originally concerned about the masses, but because some of them do not work deeply enough, they cannot understand the demands of the masses in time. However, once they discover the problem, they can make up their minds and quickly do a good job. The Hongqi Commune in Yingcheng is one example. After a brigade's general party branch secretary of Hongqi Commune ate in the canteen, he found that the canteen served only a pickled vegetable for every meal and half-cooked rice for two meals a day. Therefore, he actively strengthened the leadership, and within half a month, the canteen changed its appearance and was rated as a first-class canteen.

    Public canteens are a new product of communization, and many cadres are not yet familiar with them. To run public canteens well, so that the vast number of peasants can eat their fill and eat well, the cadres of the people's communes need to be more concerned about the work of the canteen.

    到食堂吃饭以后
    应城县巩固人民公社食堂的一个重要经验是，干部取消“小灶”，到公共食堂吃饭。因为干部到食堂吃饭以后，就可以发现问题，解决问题。
    人民公社的许多干部本来是关心群众的，但是，因为他们当中有些人的工作还不够深入，所以不能及时了解群众的要求。不过，一旦发现问题，便能下定决心，迅速把工作搞好。应城红旗公社就是一个例子。红旗公社一个大队总支书记到食堂吃饭以后，发现食堂餐餐一个酸咸菜，天天两顿夹生饭。因此，积极加强了领导，半个月内就使食堂改变了面貌，被评为甲等食堂。
    公共食堂是公社化的新产物，很多干部还不大熟悉它。要把公共食堂办好，使广大农民吃得饱吃得好，就需要人民公社的干部更多地关心食堂工作。
