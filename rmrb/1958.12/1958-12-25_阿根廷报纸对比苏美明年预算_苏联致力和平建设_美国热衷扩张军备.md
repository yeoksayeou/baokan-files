Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 23rd (TASS dispatch): Argentine newspapers are paying close attention to the ongoing session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in Moscow. Today, the local morning newspapers prominently featured news of the opening of the session and the report by Soviet Finance Minister Zverev.

The newspapers widely emphasized that the Soviet state budget stipulates that income exceeds expenditure, with a substantial increase in appropriations for economic development and further improvement of the people's material well-being. Local newspapers believe that the draft Soviet state budget stipulates a reduction, rather than an increase, in defense spending, which is of particular significance. "La Razón" made a comparison between the Soviet and US state budgets, emphasizing that President Eisenhower's draft US 1960 state budget submitted to Congress provides for "amazingly huge" military expenditures during peacetime. "La Nación," in its headline reporting on the session of the Supreme Soviet, pointed out: "The Soviet Union Allocates Huge Funds to Further Develop Science." "La Prensa" emphasized that the Soviet state budget is a "peace budget." The newspaper wrote: "While the state budget deficits of imperialist countries and their dependent countries are constantly increasing, the Soviet Union's state budget not only has no deficit but also has an income that will exceed expenditures by more than 15.5 billion rubles."

Xinhua News Agency, London, 23rd (TASS dispatch): Many British newspapers paid special attention to the fact that the Soviet 1959 state budget draft stipulates large appropriations for education and scientific research. The newspapers also pointed out that the budget once again reduces appropriations for defense.

The British "Daily Worker" wrote: The Soviet Union plans to increase appropriations for social and cultural facilities, increase appropriations for housing construction, and increase investment in industry once again. Regarding the budgetary provision to reduce defense spending, the newspaper emphasized that this has been a consistent feature of the Soviet Union in the past five years.

    阿根廷报纸对比苏美明年预算
    苏联致力和平建设  美国热衷扩张军备
    新华社24日讯  塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯23日讯：阿根廷报纸极为注意莫斯科正在举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议。今天这里的晨报都以显著地位刊登了会议开幕和苏联财政部长兹维列夫作报告的消息。
    各报纷纷着重指出，苏联国家预算规定，收入超过支出，大量增加发展经济的拨款和进一步提高人民的物质福利。当地报纸认为，苏联国家预算草案规定不是增加而是削减国防开支，这件事有特殊的意义。“号角报”将苏联和美国的国家预算作了一番比较以后，强调指出，艾森豪威尔总统将向国会提出的美国1960年国家预算草案规定了“和平时期惊人的巨大的”军费开支。“民族报”在报道苏联最高苏维埃开会消息的标题中指出：“苏联拨出巨大资金来进一步发展科学”。“时报”强调指出，苏联国家预算是“和平预算”。该报写道：“当帝国主义国家和它们的附属国家的国家预算赤字不断增加的时候，苏联的国家预算不仅没有赤字，而且收入将超过支出一百五十五亿多卢布”。
    新华社24日讯  据塔斯社伦敦23日讯：英国不少报纸特别注意苏联1959年国家预算草案中规定对教育和科学研究工作大量拨款这件事。报纸同时指出，预算中对国防的拨款再一次减少。
    英国“工人日报”写道：苏联计划再一次增加对社会文化设施的拨款，增加住宅建筑的拨款和工业方面的投资。对于预算规定缩减国防开支，报纸强调指出，这是苏联最近五年来一贯的特点。
