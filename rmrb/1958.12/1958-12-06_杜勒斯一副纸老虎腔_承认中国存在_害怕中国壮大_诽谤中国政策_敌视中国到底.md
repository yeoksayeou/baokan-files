Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 5th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech at the California Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco on the 4th, desperately defending the bankrupt U.S. policy towards China. His speech revealed that this policy has been subjected to increasingly sharp criticism at home and abroad, but despite this, the U.S. government's hostile stance towards the Chinese people remains unchanged.

Dulles could not conceal his fear of the rapid growth and strengthening of the People's Republic of China in his speech. He admitted that with the increasing consolidation and prestige of People's China, more and more people in the United States are expressing doubts about the U.S. government's "non-recognition policy." He said that some people believe that "since the Chinese Communist regime exists and has power in mainland China, we (the United States) should grant it political recognition." Dulles stubbornly rejected this claim. He said, "Whenever appropriate, we (the United States) will deal with the Chinese Communist regime; we do not insist that it does not exist." But he emphasized that the U.S. government believes that recognizing China and approving the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations would "greatly increase China's prestige and influence in the Far East," and doing so, in his view, "would seriously harm the political, economic, and security interests of the United States."

Dulles also opposed the claim by many in the United States that they wanted to conduct "large-scale and profitable trade" with China.

In his speech, Dulles tried to use his usual despicable methods of slander and defamation to provoke the friendly relations between China and the newly independent and neutral countries of Asia. He falsely accused China of carrying out "subversive activities" in other Asian countries, and he described China's equal and mutually beneficial trade with Asian countries as "dumping," but he actually had to admit that it was the United States that was carrying out subversive activities and dumping on Asian countries. He clamored that the West "must become an active force that can penetrate into (Asian countries)." Dulles also admitted in this speech that the value of goods dumped by the United States to Far Eastern countries each year, excluding military projects, amounts to $2.5 billion. And he was deeply afraid that this dumping would "be endangered."

Talking about the situation in the Taiwan Strait, Dulles once again slandered the Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory as "showing off military force." He stated that the United States would continue to interfere in China's internal affairs, clamoring that the United States must have "the will to fight" in the Taiwan Strait.

Dulles stated that the purpose of the current U.S. policy towards China is to create "two Chinas," attempting to achieve its ultimate ambitious goal of overthrowing the People's Republic of China. When talking about the joint communique of his meeting with Chiang Kai-shek, he once again disregarded the Taiwan authorities' denial and emphasized the sentence written in the communique that the Taiwan authorities must not "use force" in the Taiwan Strait, considering this to be a "welcome reaffirmation" for the United States.

Talking about the current international situation, Dulles admitted that "in the period before and after World War II, international communism has made great progress in Europe and Asia," and it now has about 900 million people. He also admitted that twenty-one new countries have gained political independence in the post-war period, and some other countries have embarked on the threshold of independence. He also had to admit the "rapid economic development" of the socialist camp, and "newly independent and less developed countries have seen this." Dulles was deeply worried about this situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind. But he still tried to cheer up the U.S. paper tiger, saying that imperialist countries "are often stronger than they appear on the surface." He clamored that the U.S. government should continue to pursue a "position of strength" policy to "contain" the socialist camp, that is to say, the U.S. government will continue to pursue its policy of expanding armaments, maintaining military blocs and establishing bases around the world, and intensifying the creation of international tensions under the guise of the so-called "communist threat," in an attempt to achieve its sinister goals of invading other countries and enslaving the people of the world.

Dulles once again shamelessly boasted about his notorious "limited war" proposition in his speech. But he indicated that the United States still wants its partners to pull chestnuts out of the fire for it.

### 杜勒斯一副纸老虎腔  承认中国存在  害怕中国壮大  诽谤中国政策  敌视中国到底

    杜勒斯一副纸老虎腔
    承认中国存在  害怕中国壮大  诽谤中国政策  敌视中国到底
    新华社5日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯4日在旧金山的加利福尼亚州商会发表演说，竭力为破了产的美国对华政策辩护。他的演说中表明，美国这个政策在国内外已受到越来越尖锐的批评，但尽管如此，美国政府敌视中国人民的立场仍继续不变。
    杜勒斯在演说中无法掩饰这样一种心情，就是中华人民共和国的迅速成长和壮大使他十分恐惧。他承认，在人民中国日益巩固和威望日益提高的情况下，美国国内越来越多的人正在对美国政府的“不承认政策”表示怀疑。他说，有一种人认为，“既然中国共产党政权存在，而且在大陆中国拥有权力，我们（美国）就应当给予它政治上的承认”。杜勒斯顽固地拒绝这个主张。他说，“只要相宜，我们（美国）就跟中国共产党政权打交道，我们并不硬说它不存在”。但是他强调，美国政府认为，承认中国和赞成恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位会使中国“在远东的威望和影响大大增加”，而这样做在他看来“将严重地损害美国的政治、经济和安全的利益”。
    杜勒斯也反对美国许多人要求同中国进行“大规模有利可图的贸易”的主张。
    杜勒斯在演说里力图用他一贯的诬蔑、诽谤等下流手法来挑拨中国同亚洲民族独立和和平中立国家的友好关系。他含血喷人地硬说中国在亚洲其他国家进行“颠复活动”，他把中国同亚洲国家的平等互利的贸易说成是“倾销”，但是他实际上不得不承认，对亚洲国家进行颠复活动和倾销的正是美国，他叫嚷西方“必须成为能够渗透到
  （亚洲国家）去的积极力量”。杜勒斯在这篇演说中还承认：美国每年除军事项目外，向远东国家倾销的商品价值即达二十五亿美元。而且他深怕这种倾销“受到危险”。
    谈到台湾海峡局势，杜勒斯又一次污蔑中国人民解放自己领土的决心是“炫耀武力”，他表示美国要继续干涉中国内政，叫嚣美国在台湾海峡要有“进行战斗的意志”。
    杜勒斯表明，美国目前对华政策的目的是要制造“两个中国”，企图借此达到它最后推翻中华人民共和国的狂妄目标。他在谈到他和蒋介石的会谈公报时，再一次不顾台湾当局的否认，而强调公报中写下的台湾当局在台湾海峡不得“使用武力”这句话，认为这对美国说来是一个“可喜的重新保证”。
    谈到当前的国际形势，杜勒斯承认，“在第二次世界大战以前和以后的时期中，国际共产主义在欧洲和亚洲取得了很大的进展”，它现在拥有大约九亿人民。他还承认，在战后时期中已经有二十一个新国家获得政治独立，其他的一些国家已经踏上独立的门槛。他也不得不承认社会主义阵营的“经济的迅速发展”，而且“新独立和不那么发达的国家看到了这一点”。杜勒斯对于这种东风压倒西风的局面忧心忡忡。但他还企图为美国这只纸老虎打气，说什么帝国主义国家“往往要比表面上看来强大”。他叫嚷美国政府要继续推行“实力地位”政策来“遏制”社会主义阵营，也就是说美国政府将要在所谓“共产党威胁”的幌子下继续推行它扩充军备，在世界各地维持军事集团和建立基地以及加紧制造国际紧张局势的政策，企图借此来达到它侵略其他国家和奴役世界各国人民的罪恶目的。
    杜勒斯在演说中又一次恬不知耻地吹嘘他那臭名远扬的“有限战争”的主张。但他表示美国仍是要它的伙伴们去为它火中取栗。
