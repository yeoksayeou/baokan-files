The Yang brothers, Yang Zaibai and Yang Zaijiang, are cousins and both renowned heroes on the national salt industry front. They work at the Huaibei Salt Field. The elder brother, Yang Zaibai, is a salt pan leader in the 27th group of the Tainan Field. He has created many advanced experiences in "year-round salt pan maintenance, four-season upkeep" and in modifying and constructing salt pans, which have been推广全国 nationwide. The output of the salt pan he leads has increased twelvefold since liberation, and he was thus评为全国盐业先进生产者 evaluated as a national advanced salt industry producer. Yang Zaijiang is the production team leader of the 31st group of the Tainan Field and has a spirit of fierce determination; if he sets his mind on something, he is sure to succeed.

Yang Zaijiang was transferred to the 31st group in the winter of 1956. At that time, the salt pan of this group was荒芜得不像样子 in a terribly desolate state, and he felt uneasy for several days after seeing it. A few days later, the field's Party General Branch called on them to learn from the advanced producer Yang Zaibai and organized the production team leaders to visit Yang Zaibai's group. When Yang Zaijiang saw it, he thought, "Didn't people create this? Can't bad conditions be changed?" So he secretly resolved to catch up with Yang Zaibai within a year.

One night, when the clock had already struck nine, Yang Zaijiang came to Zaibai's salt pan again. He discovered that there was a ditch next to the windmill array that led directly to the water storage pool and evaporation pond behind the pan. The more he looked at it, the more he felt that this ditch had a big effect. He then walked along the ditch. He didn't know that when he reached a bend, he saw a person squatting at the bottom of the ditch, digging up a shovel of mud. The person swayed and 正跟他打个照面 directly saw him face to face. He blushed and had no time to dodge, so he stepped forward and shouted: "Is that you, Third Brother? Why aren't you resting?" Yang Zaibai was taken aback: "Oh! Zaijiang, what brings you here?" Yang Zaijiang stuttered, "I went to town to buy something and thought I'd take a look."

Yang Zaibai knew that Zaijiang had a spirit of钻劲 dedication, so on Yang Zaijiang's day off, he invited Zaijiang to dinner. Taking advantage of the wine's stimulation, the two of them talked about their production experiences in a痛痛快快地 very happy and frank way. Zaibai introduced to Zaijiang: "There are two experiences to increase production: in terms of area utilization, no inch of land should be wasted; in terms of time utilization, every second should be爭分夺秒 seized..."

When Zaijiang saw his Third Brother introducing his good experiences to him one by one, he was extremely moved and regretted that he shouldn't have been so mysterious at first.

After returning, he followed his Third Brother's experience, starting with rationally using windmills to save labor, and freeing up labor to build salt pans. Yang Zaijiang consulted and researched with Party member Wang Kaimi and others in the group, and everyone supported him with action. He often led everyone to work hard until late at night. After working so hard for less than a year, his salt pan really caught up with his Third Brother. The output of raw salt even exceeded that of his Third Brother. But then his new ideal came: he wanted to build a salt pan on the wasteland west of the group and strive to greatly exceed Zaibai's salt production. He and the workers started construction in January of this year and put it into production in May.

This group, which had always been considered "老落后 consistently backward," thus jumped up to become the most advanced group.

The Yang Zaibai group, which had been leading all along, encountered a "劲敌 powerful opponent" this year. After the sunning started in March, they fell behind Yang Zaijiang for two consecutive months, which greatly shocked Zaibai. When he saw that the announced results in May still lagged behind the Yang Zaijiang group, he consulted with the workers overnight, researched new measures to catch up with Zaijiang, and also organized a new battle.

In mid-May, Comrade An Yue, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Huaibei Salt Field Party Committee, came to visit the Yang Zaibai group. An Yue said to Yang Zaibai: "Your group is a famous hero group in Huaibei. You have to争夺 strive for the first place in all of Huaibei!" Zaibai pondered for a moment and said: "I'm not afraid of anyone else, but I'm afraid I can't beat Zaijiang." An Yue smiled恳切地 sincerely and said: "Zaijiang could even aspire to catch up with you with such a bad salt pan. I think you can completely leap up again!" Zaibai felt that the secretary's words were a force, and he guaranteed him with激动的心情 excited feelings: "I will definitely catch up."

The competition between Zaijiang and Zaibai for the championship entered a climax. They paid attention to each other's developments, and if they found that the opponent's indicators were jumping high, they would immediately ask what the reason was and what窍门 tricks they had found. And no matter who found any窍门 tricks, they could exchange information. Once, Yang Zaibai told Zaijiang about the method of filling in the abandoned ditches, which could expand the evaporation and crystallization area. Yang Zaijiang, in order to打破常规 break the routine and persist in year-round production, came up with three窍门 tricks: making simple卤井 brine wells to防淡盖 prevent dilution, dredging and deepening the保卤出卤沟 brine-retaining and brine-discharging ditches, etc., and told Zaibai, who immediately adopted them.

By July, Zaibai's production target completion was still slightly lower than Zaijiang's. He personally went to Zaijiang to seek advice from teachers and friends and made a field visit. He found that Zaijiang used and developed the experience of "常年修滩 year-round salt pan maintenance" and铺起 built a new salt pan in圩西 in Xipu, which produced a lot of salt. He then opened his mind, because there was also a large area of wasteland south of his group. With the right key, he didn't have to worry about unlocking the lock.

After Zaibai returned home, he immediately started铺滩 laying salt pans. Zaijiang also started铺 laying another new salt pan, which was twice as large as his Third Brother's. When Zaibai heard that he was铺 laying such a large salt pan, he prepared to铺 lay another large salt pan.

Now Yang Zaijiang's two salt pans have been built, and in terms of production plan completion and salt pan construction progress, they are slightly higher than Zaibai's, but Zaibai is拼命追赶 desperately catching up. The competition between the two brothers for first place is still going on热火朝天的 vigorously.

    杨家兄弟争第一
    袁骅  王友名
    杨再柏和杨再江是堂兄弟俩，都是闻名于全国盐业战线的英雄。他们战斗在淮北盐场上。哥哥杨再柏在台南场二十七小组当领滩手，他创造过“长年修滩、四季保养”和改滩、建滩等方面很多先进的经验，已推广全国。他领的滩，解放几年来产量提高了十二倍，因此他被评为全国盐业先进生产者。杨再江是台南场三十一小组的生产组长，有股蛮干的劲，干什么事只要决心一下，准能成功。
    杨再江是1956年冬天调到三十一小组的，当时这个小组的滩地荒芜得不像样子，他看了好几天心情不舒畅。不几天，场党总支号召向先进生产者杨再柏学习，又组织生产组长到杨再柏小组去参观，杨再江到那儿一看，心里想：“这不也是人干出来的么？条件不好不可以改变么？”于是便暗地里下定决心，要在一年之内赶上杨再柏。
    有天夜晚，时钟已敲过九下，杨再江又来到再柏滩上，发现风车阵地旁边有条地沟直通滩后储水池和蒸发池，越端详就越觉这条沟作用大，便信步尾着这条沟走去，那知走到拐弯处，见蹲在沟底下有一个人，一锹泥挖上来，身一晃正跟他打个照面，他脸一红，已躲闪不及，便上前喊道：是三哥么？怎么还不休息。杨再柏大吃一惊：咦！再江么，你怎么有空来的？杨再江吱唔着说：上镇买东西顺便瞧瞧的。
    杨再柏知道再江有股子钻劲，便在杨再江的休假日，把再江请来吃饭，乘着酒兴二人痛痛快快地谈起生产经验来。再柏向再江介绍说：要增产有两条经验：面积利用上要寸土不让、时间利用上要分秒必争……。
    再江见三哥滔滔不绝地把好经验一一向他介绍，心里感动极了，悔当初不该那么神秘。
    回去后，他便按照三哥的经验，从合理使用风车节省劳动力做起，腾出劳动力来修建滩地。杨再江和组内党员王开米等商量研究，大家都用行动来支持他，他常常带领大家苦干到深夜。就这样苦干了不到一年，他的滩真的赶上了三哥。原盐产量竟超过了他的三哥。可是他新的理想又来了；他要在小组西边的废地上建起一分滩来，争取盐产量大大超过再柏。他和工人们今年1月动工，5月就投入生产。
    这个一向被人们认为“老落后”的小组就这样一跃而成为最先进的小组。
    一直领先的杨再柏小组，今年算是碰到了“劲敌”。3月开晒后接连两个月落在杨再江之后，给再柏的震动极大。当他5月份看到公布的成绩还是落后于杨再江小组时，就连夜找工人商量，研究新措施赶再江，还组织了新战役。
    5月中旬，中共淮北盐场党委副书记安岳同志来杨再柏小组参观，安岳向杨再柏说：“你们这个组是淮北有名气的英雄小组，要争夺全淮北的头名才行啊！”再柏思索了一下说：“旁人不怕，就怕揪不过再江。”安岳恳切地笑着说：“再江原来那样孬的滩都能立志赶你，我看你完全可以再跃上去！”再柏觉得书记的话是一股力量，他怀着激动的心情，向他保证：“我一定要追上去”。
    再江和再柏之间争夺冠军的竞赛进入了高峰，互相注意对方的动态，发现对手指标跳得高了，就立即询问是什么原因，找到了什么窍门，而不论谁找到了什么窍门，都能互通情报。有次杨再柏把用报废的沟道填平的办法、可以扩大蒸发和结晶面积的办法告诉了再江。杨再江为了打破常规坚持常年生产，想出了：做简易卤井防淡盖，疏通和加深保卤出卤沟等三个窍门，告诉了再柏，再柏就立即采用了。
    到7月份再柏的生产指标完成情况还稍低于再江，他亲自上再江那儿求师访友，实地看了一趟。他发现再江运用和发展了“常年修滩”的经验，在圩西铺起了一分新滩，产盐很多，心里就开了窍，因为他的小组南面也有大块废地，有了对头的钥匙就不愁打不开锁。
    再柏回家后立即动手铺滩，再江也动手铺另一分新滩，面积比三哥的大一倍，再柏听说他铺这么大的滩，又准备再铺一分大滩。
    现在杨再江两分滩都已建成，在生产计划完成和建滩进度方面都稍高于再柏，但再柏正在拼命追赶，两位兄弟争第一的竞赛还正在热火朝天的进行中。
