    New People, New Style
    Friendship Before the Fiery Steel Furnace
    The newly built Harbin Steam Turbine Factory had to rush to manufacture three large steam turbines before the end-of-year national acceptance, in order to ensure the power generation equipment could be delivered as a complete set. In this inspiring battle, Liu Deming, a worker at the "three-ton electric furnace" in the steel casting workshop, and Tian Chongli, a worker at the "five-ton electric furnace," along with all the workers at these two furnaces, launched a competition without any formal battle plan.
    Both Liu Deming and Tian Chongli were skilled at rapidly skimming slag and feeding materials. On September 29, all the steelworkers aimed to double their daily output. The "five-ton electric furnace" first increased its working speed by half, the "three-ton electric furnace" doubled its speed, and then the "five-ton electric furnace" increased its speed by one and a half times, constantly chasing each other.
    At eleven o'clock at night, with only one more furnace of steel needed to double the output, the "five-ton electric furnace" suddenly malfunctioned. Several refractory bricks fell off the back wall of the furnace. Should they rush to repair it, or shut down the furnace and stop smelting? At this moment, Tian Chongli told his team leader and said, "Withdraw from the furnace core and repair it!" He picked up an asbestos board and climbed onto the furnace roof to open the furnace cover. Flames shot upwards from the furnace cavity, and Tian Chongli's sweat was instantly dried by the heat. The people working below the furnace felt an unbearable burning sensation.
    Liu Deming, as Tian Chongli's competitor, immediately left his own furnace and ran over, without saying a word, climbed onto the furnace roof and began repairs shoulder to shoulder with Tian Chongli. The chief metallurgist and workshop cadres, all the workers of the "five-ton electric furnace" and some workers of the "three-ton electric furnace" joined the battle. People shoveled magnesia mud from below and passed it upwards, and they took it and threw it into the furnace wall where the refractory bricks had fallen off. Their gloves caught fire and smoked, they changed to another pair and continued. The asbestos board under their feet smoked, and they just moved their feet slightly. Liu Deming persisted for twenty minutes, helping Tian Chongli repair the "five-ton electric furnace" before returning to his own furnace.
    That day, they finally more than doubled their daily output. They didn't distinguish victory or defeat between them; they achieved a common victory.
    Breaking Through Old Rules
    This is a story that recently happened in the metal structure workshop of the Harbin Boiler Factory.
    Welding the "air preheater," an important component of steam boilers, is a very precise welding job, which has always been stipulated to be done by workers of level four or above. However, Meng Xianxia, Yu Gengnian's apprentice—an eighteen-year-old female apprentice who had only been in the factory for just over two months—actually started operating independently. Although the products she welded passed the quality inspection, the inspector believed that this did not comply with the regulations and still did not allow her to do it?
    Yu Gengnian and Meng Xianxia were very unconvinced. When receiving this group of apprentices, the factory Party committee made it clear at the staff meeting that in order to support the national power equipment, it was required to train this group of apprentices well within half a year. For the past two months, they came to work early and left late, picked up a lot of waste materials, and the master practiced with the apprentice's hand, day after day. Now that she can do it, why not let her do it?
    The matter was brought to the workshop Party branch, and a special issue was immediately published on the blackboard newspaper, with five large characters written on the headline: "Break Through Old Rules!"
    People wanted to see how well Meng Xianxia could do, so they did an on-the-spot test. Yu Gengnian asked Meng Xianxia to try for an hour. Meng Xianxia picked up the welding pliers, clamped the welding rod, and started working. Starting from the lower end of the circumference of each joint steel pipe, she moved the welding rod from left to right in a semicircle. After the sparks flashed, it was as easy as drawing a circle on paper with a pencil. The two-millimeter wide circumference line was welded evenly, neatly, and with appropriate thickness. When one o'clock arrived, they stopped and calculated that they had welded a full 120 joints, with qualified quality. A level-four worker can only weld 90 joints per hour, but she welded so many. This speed was unbelievable, so they tried again, and calculated that there was an increase, reaching 123. Yu Gengnian suppressed his emotional excitement and said to Meng Xianxia: "You can work independently!" Meng Xianxia called out shyly: "Master!"
    The branch organized an on-site meeting to promote the spirit of hard teaching and hard learning of the master and apprentice. Subsequently, the workshop formally decided that Meng Xianxia would work independently, and announced: abolish the old rules, and in the future, regardless of the level, seniority, whoever can do a good job will report it, and with the approval of the leadership, they can boldly do it.

    新人新风格
    钢炉烈火前的友谊
    新建的哈尔滨汽轮机厂要在年底国家验收前赶造三台大型汽轮机，要使发电设备配套出厂。在这场振奋人心的战斗中，铸钢车间“三吨电炉”工人刘德明和“五吨电炉”工人田崇礼，以及这两个炉子的全体工人一道展开了一次没下战表的竞赛。
    刘德明和田崇礼都是快速抛滓、送料的能手。9月29日全体炼钢工人要把日产量翻一番。“五吨电炉”先把工作速度提高半倍，“三吨电炉”提高一倍，随后“五吨电炉”又提高一倍半，彼此互相追赶。
    午夜十一点，只差最后一炉钢产量就要翻过去了，“五吨电炉”忽然发生了故障，后炉壁上掉下几块耐火砖。是抢修，还是停炉不炼？这时候，田崇礼向他的组长打了一个招呼，就说：“退出炉心，抢修！”他顺手拿起一块石棉板就爬上炉顶揭开炉盖，炉腔向上喷着熊熊的火焰，田崇礼满身汗水立刻被烤干，炉下工作的人们都感到灼热难耐。
    刘德明作为田崇礼的竞赛对手，这时，立刻离开自己的炉子跑了过来，一句话也没说就爬上了炉顶，和田崇礼并肩抢修。总冶金师和车间干部，“五吨电炉”全体工人和“三吨电炉”部分工人都参加了战斗。人们从炉下往上一锹锹的递送镁砂泥，他俩在上面接过来就往掉了耐火砖的炉壁里抛，手套烧得冒火了，换一付继续干，垫脚的石棉板冒烟了，脚就挪动一下。刘德明一直坚持二十分钟，帮助田崇礼把“五吨电炉”抢修好，才回到自己的炉上。
    这一天，他们到底把日产量翻了一番多，他们互相间没分胜败，他们共同胜利了。冲破老规矩
    这是哈尔滨锅炉厂金属结构车间最近发生的故事。
    焊接蒸汽锅炉的重要部件“空气预热器”是一项十分精致的电焊工作，一向规定要由四级以上工人来做。可是于赓年的徒弟孟宪霞——一个十八岁的女徒工，进厂刚刚两个多月，竟然单独操作起来。她焊接的产品经过检查虽然质量都合格，可是检查员认为这不合规定，仍旧不让她做？
    于赓年和孟宪霞很不服气。接收这批徒弟的时候，工厂党委在全体职工大会上交代得清清楚楚，为了支援全国发电设备，要求在半年之内突击把这批徒工培养好。他们两个月来，早上班，晚下班，拣了许多废料，师傅把着徒弟的手，一天又一天地练习。现在她能做了，为什么不让做？
    事情闹到车间党支部去，黑板报马上出了一次专刊，刊头上写了五个大字：“冲破老规矩！”
    人们想要看看孟宪霞到底干得怎么样，来个当场试验。于赓年让孟宪霞试做一个小时。孟宪霞拿起电焊钳子，夹上焊条就干了起来，从每个接头钢管圆周的下端开始，把焊条从左向上走个半圆，再从右向上走个半圆，火花闪过之后，就像用铅笔在纸上画圈一样轻便，两公厘宽的圆周线，焊得均匀整齐、厚薄合适。一点钟到了，停手一算，整整焊了一百二十个接头，质量合格。一个四级工每小时才能焊好九十个接头，她却焊了这样多。这个速度使人不敢相信，于是另试一遍，算了算又有增加，达到一百二十三个，于赓年抑制着感情的激动，对孟宪霞说：“你可以单独工作了！”孟宪霞有点羞怯地叫了一声：“师傅！”
    支部组织了一次现场会，宣扬了他们师徒苦教苦学的精神。随后，车间里正式决定孟宪霞单独工作，并且宣布：废除老规矩，以后不论等级高低、工龄长短，谁能干好什么工作就报告，经过领导批准，都可以大胆地干。（附图片）
