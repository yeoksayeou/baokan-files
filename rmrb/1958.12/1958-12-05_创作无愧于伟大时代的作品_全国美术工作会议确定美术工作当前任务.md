Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association jointly convened the National Fine Arts Work Conference from November 21st to 27th.

    This conference exchanged and summarized the experiences of mass art popularization work since the Great Leap Forward; and the experiences of professional art workers going to the countryside, factories, and companies to create and guide mass creation, and determined the current tasks of art work. This task is: under the brilliant light of the general line, with communist ideology as the guiding principle, continue to implement the mass line, vigorously carry out art popularization work, and actively improve on the basis of widespread popularization, so that experts and the masses, professional and amateur, art creation and production labor are better combined; and continue to correctly implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and strive to create works with communist ideological content and newer and more beautiful art forms to serve socialist construction, production, and politics, as a gift to the Party for the tenth anniversary of National Day next year.
    The conference believes that, like other literary and artistic undertakings, art work has, under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, begun to form a massive and far-reaching mass art popularization movement. In particular, the vigorous development of murals and cartoons by workers, peasants, and soldiers has become the main content of the current art popularization movement. Many mural counties, townships, and communes have emerged across the country; many workers have written their own factory histories in the form of paintings; and soldiers in companies have created many excellent "soldier painting soldier" works. These mass art works have promoted production and political struggle, boosted morale, beautified the motherland, changed the appearance of many rural environments, and satisfied the masses' demand for art appreciation.
    The conference believes that breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, resolutely implementing the Party's mass line, and fighting against various erroneous ideas that hinder the development of the movement are the main keys to creating a situation of widespread art popularization. The conference used many facts to criticize erroneous arguments such as "art mystery theory," "genius theory," "condition theory," and "contradiction between painting and production theory," and pointed out that art was originally created by the working people, and many of the most talented artists came from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the same time, art is also one of the powerful tools for publicizing the Party's policies and lines, and encouraging the masses' labor and enthusiasm for political struggle.
    The conference believes that the widespread popularization of art among workers, peasants, and soldiers has laid a solid foundation for the improvement of art creation. The current task of professional art workers is to continue to go deep into the countryside, factories, and companies, impart their experience and technology to the masses, and guide and improve the creation of the masses; at the same time, they must continue to adhere to participating in labor training, learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and arming themselves with communist ideology to further improve their creative level and create more excellent art works that combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. The conference especially emphasized that art work must also take two roads, both professional art work and amateur art work, that is, the combination of experts and the masses, so as to consolidate achievements and make the art movement in-depth and lasting.
    More than 160 people attended the conference, including professional and amateur art workers from various places, professors from art colleges, folk artists, and cadres from cultural departments. The conference specially held a creative experience symposium for more than 30 amateur painters of workers, peasants, and soldiers to introduce their art creation activities and the situation and experience of carrying out mass art movements. During the discussion, the representatives gave high praise to the creations of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and expressed that they would learn from the worker-peasant-soldier painters.

    创作无愧于伟大时代的作品
    全国美术工作会议确定美术工作当前任务
    新华社4日讯  文化部和中国美术家协会在11月21日至27日联合召开了全国美术工作会议。
    这次会议交流和总结了大跃进以来群众美术普及工作的经验；和专业美术工作者下乡、下厂、下连队创作和辅导群众创作的经验，确定了美术工作当前的任务。这个任务是：在总路线光辉的照耀下，以共产主义思想为纲，继续贯彻群众路线，大力开展美术普及工作，在大普及的基础上积极提高，使专家与群众、专业与业余、美术创作与生产劳动更好地结合；并继续正确贯彻百花齐放、推陈出新的政策，努力创作出有共产主义思想内容和更新更美的美术形式的作品，为建设社会主义，为生产、为政治服务，作为明年国庆十周年的向党献礼。
    会议认为：一年来，美术工作也像其他文艺事业一样，在工农业生产大跃进的带动下，开始形成一个声势浩大、影响深远的群众美术普及运动。特别是工农兵群众壁画、漫画的蓬勃发展，成为当前美术普及运动的主要内容。全国出现了许许多多壁画县、乡、社；许多工人用绘画的形式写出了自己的工厂史；连队士兵创作了许多优秀的兵画兵的作品。这些群众美术作品推动了生产和政治斗争，鼓舞了士气，也美化了祖国，改变了许多农村环境面貌，满足了广大群众对美术欣赏的要求。
    会议认为打破迷信，解放思想，坚决贯彻党的群众路线，与各种阻碍运动发展的错误思想进行斗争，是造成美术大普及形势的主要关键。会议用许多事实批判了“美术神秘论”、“天才论”、“条件论”以及“绘画与生产矛盾论”等错误论调，并且指出美术原来就是劳动人民创造的，许多最有才能的艺术家来自工农兵群众。同时美术也是宣传党的政策、路线，鼓舞群众的劳动和政治斗争热情的有力工具之一。
    会议认为工农兵美术大普及，为美术创作的提高打下了巩固的基础。当前专业美术工作者的任务就是要继续深入农村、工厂、连队，把自己的经验、技术传授给群众，辅导提高群众的创作；同时，还必须继续坚持参加劳动锻炼，向工农兵学习，并用共产主义的思想武装自己，进一步提高创作水平，创作出更多的革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的优秀美术作品。会议特别强调了美术工作也必须两条腿走路，既要有专业美术工作，更要有业余美术工作，即专家与群众结合，这样才能巩固成绩，使美术运动深入和持久。
    出席这次会议的有各地专业和业余的美术工作者、美术院校教授、民间艺人、文化部门干部等一百六十多人。会议为三十多位工农兵业余画家，专门举行了创作经验座谈会，介绍他们的美术创作活动和开展群众美术运动的情况与经验。代表们在讨论中，对工农兵群众的创作给予了很高的评价，表示要向工农兵画家学习。
