Title: U.S. Foreign Policy in Disrepute; Dulles Vilified Throughout the Year

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th - Our correspondent reports: Throughout 1958, voices condemning Dulles could be heard from all corners of the world. Even American newspapers admit that Dulles is "the most fiercely attacked diplomat in the world."

Dulles, this raven of the contemporary Western world, is a symbol of American foreign policy. During his tenure as U.S. Secretary of State, he further developed the "position of strength" policy. The Washington rulers stubbornly antagonize socialist countries and national independence movements. This year alone, the United States pushed the world to the "brink of war" twice, in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait, as advocated by Dulles. The United States also frequently uses Dulles' whip and his so-called "agonizing reappraisal" to intimidate its "allies."

America's clutches extend to the whole world, and the whole world echoes in response. A famous American political figure, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan, admitted in October of this year that the United States has become "the most hated country in the world." He said that apart from the United States, he could not find another country that "has attracted so much opprobrium, so much animosity, so much discontent and so much criticism, and in some cases so much outright hatred."

As for Dulles, even in the Western world, he has become the target of public criticism. In September and October of this year, when the United States was frenetically engaged in war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, there were two very vivid conversations in the two "closest" allies of the United States. British Labor Party leader Bevan said, "Every time Mr. Dulles gives a speech, it sends shivers down my spine. I wake up every morning with a feeling of dread because he is playing such a dangerous game of brinkmanship." Hazen Argue, leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the Canadian House of Commons, said that Dulles was "a millstone around the neck of Western foreign policy," and that "Dulles, with his fiery passion for pursuing the brink of war and his fanatical pursuit of military treaties, has led the Western alliance into an impasse and a dead end that we can no longer afford."

A reporter for the "Daily Telegraph," Britain's most right-wing Conservative newspaper, published an article in November after visiting nine Western European countries, including France, West Germany, and Italy, saying that many Europeans were particularly vehemently opposed to the American foreign policy implemented by Dulles. "In the nine countries I visited, not a single country voiced approval of Dulles." Western Europeans believe that Dulles "completely disregards" the interests of the allies, and as they watch this rushing Secretary of State at work, they are generally very worried that they "are being carried across the bottomless abyss by the Americans, who are far from being reliable tightrope walkers."

In the United States, Dulles has this year been subjected to unusually strong and widespread public condemnation rarely seen in American history. When the United States was playing with fire in the Taiwan Strait, newspaper editorial offices across the United States were piled high with letters from readers opposing Dulles' policy. A letter from a female reader, Helen Shane, published in the "New York Post," expressed the indignation of millions of ordinary American people. She wrote, "I am not willing to die yet, and even if I were to commit suicide, I would like to choose the time and place myself, and not have Dulles decide." She also wrote that no matter how many statements Dulles makes, he is "actually the worst direct aggressor and indirect aggressor." Under public pressure, in September and October, the vast majority of bourgeois newspaper columnists, cartoonists, and television commentators across the United States came out to attack and ridicule Dulles. Following this, the ruling Republican Party was abandoned by voters in the November congressional elections and suffered a disastrous defeat.

This year can be said to be a year of great exposure for American imperialism. It not only revealed how dangerous Dulles' "brink of war" trick is, how outwardly strong and inwardly weak the war makers are, and how isolated they are, but it also revealed how Dulles and his ilk stubbornly adhere to the reactionary logic of making trouble, failing, and then making trouble again. The United States just suffered a setback in the Middle East, and then came to brazenly provoke the Chinese people. After suffering another defeat in the Chinese region, Dulles recently clamored for allies to provide 80% of the ground troops for "limited wars." He came to Paris this time with a whip, wanting the NATO allies to implement this plan. In the current international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, as the "New York Post" described, "Dulles' so-called show of strength is a sign of hysteria." Dulles "sent the (U.S.) Sixth Fleet into (the Arab Orient) and then pulled it out, and then waved it around everywhere. You are playing tricks yourself, but you end up running around in circles. ... ... And then you use the Seventh Fleet (in the Taiwan Strait) to repeat a scene. ......" Of course, the development of the situation is by no means a simple repetition. The more Dulles spins like this, the tighter the noose around the neck of American imperialism becomes, and the closer the day of going to the gallows gets.

Dulles also has a set of "good tricks": when he is waving a big stick and running around in circles, he always says that he is based on this or that "moral principle." Even American bourgeois commentator Lippmann believes that Dulles' trick is too disgusting. Lippmann wrote sarcastically in December that if Dulles "had self-awareness, he would be more modest and would not flaunt this power with moral dogmas and as if he were a special embodiment of justice." Dulles used to be an "active member" of the American church, and he especially likes to quote "Christian doctrines." However, even some American churches are increasingly strongly criticizing Dulles. The "Supreme Religious Court" of the Presbyterian Church in the United States passed a resolution in June, fiercely criticizing the U.S. government for committing "international hypocrisy abhorrent to Christians." Prior to this, the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church in the United States also pointed out that the American approach "will never win the war for hearts and minds."

Everything that Dulles has shown and everything that he has encountered is one of the most vivid miniatures of the decline of American imperialism.

### 美国外交政策声名狼借  杜勒斯一年来受尽唾骂

    美国外交政策声名狼借
    杜勒斯一年来受尽唾骂
    新华社25日讯  本社记者报道：在1958年这一年里，从全世界各个角落，都可以经常听到谴责杜勒斯的声音。连美国报刊也承认，杜勒斯是“世界上受到最猛烈攻击的外交家”。
    杜勒斯，这个当代西方世界的乌鸦，是美国外交政策的象征。在他担任美国国务卿期间，进一步发展了“实力地位”政策。华盛顿统治者顽固地敌视社会主义国家和民族独立运动。在今年一年中，美国就在中东和台湾海峡两次把世界推到了杜勒斯鼓吹的“战争边缘”。美国对待它的“盟友”，经常使用的也是杜勒斯的皮鞭和他所谓“忍痛重新估计”的恫吓。
    美国的魔掌伸向全世界，也在全世界得到了回响。美国一个有名的政界人物、前驻苏联大使凯南在今年10月间承认，美国已经成为“世界上最受人憎恨的国家”。他说，除了美国以外，他还找不出其他国家“竟为自己招来这么多的詈骂，这么多的恶感，这么多的不满和这么多的批评，以及在某些情况下这么多的赤裸裸的仇恨”。
    而杜勒斯呢，即使在西方世界里，也成为众矢之的。今年9、10月里，当美国在台湾海峡狂热进行战争挑衅的时候，在美国“最亲近”的两个盟国内，有两篇说得颇为淋漓尽致的谈话。英国工党的一个领袖比万说，“杜勒斯先生每发表一次演说，都使我感到毛骨悚然。我每天早上醒来的时候，总有一种恐惧的感觉，因为他在玩弄如此危险的边缘游戏。”加拿大众议院合作联盟领袖哈曾·阿纠说，杜勒斯是“套在西方外交政策脖子上的磨盘”，“杜勒斯以炽烈的热情追逐着战争边缘，狂热地追求军事条约，已经把西方联盟引到我们再也吃不消的绝境和死胡同里”。
    英国最右翼的保守党报纸“每日电讯报”的一个记者在访问法国、西德、意大利等九个西欧国家后，11月间发表文章说，许多欧洲人特别激烈反对杜勒斯所执行的美国外交政策，“在我所访问的九个国家里，没有一个国家发出赞成杜勒斯的声音”，西欧人认为杜勒斯“丝毫不顾”盟国的利益，当他们注视着这个来去匆匆的国务卿在工作时，他们普遍非常担心“是被美国人抱着跨过无底深渊，而这些美国人却远不是可靠的走高空钢索的演员”。
    在美国国内，杜勒斯今年遭到了美国历史上少见的十分强烈而普遍的公众谴责。当美国在台湾海峡玩火时，美国全国各地报纸的编辑部都堆满了反对杜勒斯政策的读者来信。“纽约邮报”发表的女读者海伦·谢恩的一封信，发出了千千万万美国普通人民的激愤声音。她写道，“我还不愿意死，而且即使我要自杀，我也愿意自己来挑选时间和地点，而不要杜勒斯来决定”。她还写道：不管杜勒斯发表多少声明，他“其实是最坏的直接侵略者和间接侵略者”。在公众的压力下，9、10月间美国全国绝大多数资产阶级报纸专栏作家、漫画家、电视评论员都出来攻击和挖苦杜勒斯。紧跟着的是，执政的共和党在11月国会选举中为选民所唾弃，遭到了惨败。
    今年，可以说是美帝国主义大暴露的一年。不仅暴露出杜勒斯“战争边缘”把戏是怎样的危险，战争制造者又是怎样的外强中干和陷入怎样的孤立，同时也暴露出杜勒斯之流是怎样死死遵循着捣乱、失败、再捣乱这个反动派的逻辑。美国刚在中东碰壁，接着又来向中国人民猖狂挑衅。在中国地区再遭失败后，杜勒斯最近又叫嚷要盟国提供80％的地面部队来进行“有限战争”。他这次在巴黎，便是带着皮鞭，要北大西洋集团盟国执行这个计划的。在目前东风压倒西风的国际形势下，正如“纽约邮报”所形容的，“杜勒斯所谓的显示实力的行动正是歇斯底里的迹象”，杜勒斯“把（美国在地中海的）第六舰队送进（阿拉伯东方）去，又把第六舰队拉出来，然后又拿着它到处幌一幌。你自己在变戏法，结果却搞得自己团团转。…………然后又用第七舰队（在台湾海峡）来重演一场。………”当然，局势的发展决不是简单的重复，杜勒斯这样转得愈多，美帝国主义套在自己脖子上的绞索就被抽得愈紧，离上绞刑台的日子就愈近。
    杜勒斯还有一套“拿手好戏”：当他在挥舞大棒团团转的时候，总满口说他是基于这一条或那一条的“道义原则”。连美国资产阶级评论员李普曼也认为杜勒斯这套手法过于令人作呕。李普曼在12月间讥刺地写道，要是杜勒斯“有自知之明的话，他就会谦虚一些，就不会带着道德的教条和俨然是特别的正义的化身的味道来炫耀这种力量”。杜勒斯曾经是美国教会里的“活跃分子”，他是特别喜欢引用“基督教教义”的。但是，就连一些美国教会也愈来愈强烈地指责起杜勒斯来了。美国长者会“最高宗教裁判会议”6月间通过决议，猛烈指责美国政府犯有“为基督教徒所憎恶的国际伪善”。在这以前，美国卫理公会主教会议还指出，照美国这样的作法，“决不会赢得争取人心的战争”。
    杜勒斯所表现的一切，所遭到的一切，正是美帝国主义烂下去的最生动的缩影之一。（附图片）
