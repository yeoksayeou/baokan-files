Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 27th (TASS dispatch): The United Nations General Assembly continued its general political discussion in its morning and afternoon sessions on September 26th.

    The first speaker at the morning session was Chilean representative Rudecindo Ortega. He said that in all the work of the United Nations, "we should first emphasize those things that unite us and eliminate those that divide us."

    Ortega spoke mostly about economic aid to underdeveloped countries. He said that the current economic aid provided through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund, and other channels cannot solve the economic development problems of these countries. He called for changes to the entire structure of international trade and international allocations. Ortega emphasized the great significance of talks between major powers to resolve political issues and asked that major powers give due attention to economic issues in their talks.

    Next to speak was the head of the Yugoslav delegation, Popović. He said: The improvement of the world situation has basically created the conditions that make it possible to try to resolve the major issues that have divided the world until now, and there is ample hope of success. Popović pointed out the necessity of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems and different ideas, believing that "this is the only possible answer to the fundamental problems of the modern world." Speaking of the development of the international situation, he said: The Asian-African Conference in Bandung is "a practical example of active cooperation between countries with relatively different views, and an important testament to the growing role of these two young continents in international affairs."

    Speaking of the United Nations organization, Popović pointed out that the United Nations has not yet become an organization with universal representation, because many countries have not yet entered the United Nations. He advocated restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and accepting all countries applying for membership, as long as "the international status of these countries does not actually raise any doubts."

    Iraqi representative Jamali spoke near the end of the morning session. Jamali called the assembly's attention to the need to resolve the Tunisian issue, the Moroccan issue, and the Algerian issue as quickly as possible, and suggested that the assembly set a final deadline "for implementing the principle of self-determination for all colonial peoples and oppressed peoples, after which colonialism must be completely eliminated."

    In his speech, Jamali also attempted to prove that "Communist activity" is supposedly "one of the roots of national tensions."

    Speakers at the afternoon session included representatives from Canada, Panama, Yemen, Bolivia, and Greece.

    Canadian delegation head Martin emphasized that major powers have already pointed out the path to easing tensions, and urged the United Nations to follow their example.

    Speaking on the issue of disarmament, Martin said that this is a fundamental issue, and that further easing of international tensions and the establishment of lasting peace depend on its resolution. He said: The reduction of armaments and the prohibition of nuclear weapons should be well coordinated and arranged so that every country has no reason to fear for its security at any stage of this work.

    Martin said: The subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission has made important progress on the road to reaching agreement on the dates and plans for reducing armaments and banning nuclear weapons.

    Martin then turned to the Soviet government's proposal of May 10th this year. He said that the Soviet plan contains some important recommendations regarding the issue of supervision, although his government believes that the Soviet recommendations on supervision and inspection are still inadequate.

    Martin also expressed support for Eisenhower's proposal for the Soviet Union and the United States to exchange military information and conduct mutual aerial reconnaissance of each other's territories.

    Speaking on the issue of admitting new member states, Martin said that the United Nations can only make the fullest contribution to the resolution of international problems when it can fully represent the vast majority of countries in the world.

    Martin opposed convening a conference to amend the Charter, and said that before resolving this issue, the General Assembly should first consider whether convening such a conference would promote the easing of international tensions.

    Panamanian representative A. Boyd spoke next. He expressed hope that in the new international situation, the United Nations will be able to act more effectively, and that the principle of cooperation will prevail in resolving issues such as disarmament, the control of nuclear weapons, and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    The speech by the head of the Yemeni delegation, S. Hassan, particularly emphasized the urgent need to grant the people of French colonies such as Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco the right to self-determination, and to stop the foreign occupation of the southern regions of his country. He also emphasized the need to resolve the West Irian issue with due consideration for the interests of the Indonesian people.

    The head of the Bolivian delegation, Bolivian Vice President Suzo, mentioned in his speech the need for "fair" international trade.

    Suzo pointed out that disarmament would be of great importance to improving the welfare of people in all countries. He said that not only major powers and industrialized countries, but also so-called small countries and industrially backward countries should embark on the path of reducing military expenditures.

    The last speaker was Greek representative and Foreign Minister Stephanopoulos. He expressed concern that the General Assembly decided not to include the Cyprus issue on the agenda, saying that this was "closing the door to a small country whose people want to be heard."

    He said that this decision was "contrary to the principles of the Charter and incompatible with the interests of this organization." He welcomed the recent improvement in the international atmosphere and the re-establishment of trust between countries, and expressed hope that the international situation will continue to develop in this direction, freeing the people of all countries from the Cold War and enabling the United Nations to carry out effective activities.

    联合国大会会议继续进行一般性辩论
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：九月二十六日，联合国大会上午和下午会议继续进行一般性政治讨论。
    上午会议上首先发言的是智利代表鲁德西诺·奥特加。他说，在联合国的全部工作中，“首先应该强调那些使我们一致的地方，消除那些使我们分歧的地方”。
    奥特加在发言中大部分谈的是对落后国家的经济援助问题。他说，目前通过国际复兴开发银行、国际货币基金组织和其他方式提供的经济援助是不能解决这些国家的经济发展问题的。他要求改变国际贸易和国际拨款的全部结构。奥特加强调指出大国为解决政治问题而进行会谈的重大意义，他要求大国在进行会谈时对经济问题给予应有的重视。
    接着是南斯拉夫代表团团长波波维奇发言。他说：世界局势的改善，基本上已经创造了条件，使人们有可能来设法解决到现在为止使世界陷于分裂的重大问题，而且有充分的成功的希望。波波维奇指出具有不同制度和不同观念的国家和平共处的必要性，他认为“这是现代世界的基本问题的唯一可能的答案”。他在谈到国际局势的发展时说：万隆的亚非会议是“具有相对不同的观点的国家可以积极合作的一个实际的榜样，同时也是这两个年轻的大陆在国际事务中的作用日益增长的一个重要证明”。
    波波维奇在谈到联合国组织时指出，联合国还没有成为一个具有普遍代表性的组织，因为有许多国家至今还没有进入联合国。他主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，并且接受一切申请加入联合国的国家为会员国，只要“这些国家的国际地位实际上不引起任何怀疑”。
    伊拉克代表贾马利在上午会议快要结束时发言。贾马利提请大会注意有必要从速解决突尼斯问题、摩洛哥问题和阿尔及利亚问题，并且建议大会确定一个最后的期限“对所有殖民地人民和被压迫的人民施行自决原则，在这一期限以后，殖民主义必须彻底消灭”。
    贾马利在发言中同时企图证明，“共产党活动”据说是“产生国家紧张局势的根源之一”。
    在下午会议上发言的有加拿大、巴拿马、也门、玻利维亚和希腊的代表。
    加拿大代表团团长马丁强调各大国已经指出缓和紧张局势的道路，并且要求联合国效法它们的榜样。
    马丁在谈到裁军问题时说，这是一个基本问题，国际紧张局势的进一步缓和以及持久和平的建立有待于这个问题的解决。他说：裁减军备和禁止核子武器这两件事应当配合和安排得很好，使每一个国家在这件工作的任何一个阶段都没有任何理由担心他们的安全受到威胁。
    马丁说：在就裁减军备和禁止核子武器的日期和计划达成协议的道路上，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会已经获得重要的进展。
    马丁转而谈到苏联政府今年五月十日的建议。他说，苏联的计划包含了一些关于监督问题的重要建议，虽然他的政府认为，苏联关于监督和视察的建议仍然是不充分的。
    马丁还表示支持艾森豪威尔提出的苏联和美国交换军事情报和互相在空中侦察对方领土的建议。
    马丁在谈到接纳新会员国的问题时说，只有等到联合国能够充分代表世界上绝大多数国家时，它才能对国际问题的解决作出最充分的贡献。
    马丁反对召开修改宪章的会议，并且说，在解决这个问题以前，大会应该首先考虑召开这样的会议，是否会促进国际紧张局势的缓和。
    巴拿马代表阿·波依德接着发言。他表示希望在新的国际局势中联合国将能更加有效地行动，合作的原则将能在解决裁军、管制核子武器和和平使用原子能等问题中获胜。
    也门代表团团长斯·哈森的发言特别强调迫切需要给予突尼斯、阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥等法国殖民地的人民以自决的权利，停止外国对他的国家南部地区的占领。他还强调必须在给予印度尼西亚人民的利益以应有的考虑的情况下解决西伊里安问题。
    玻利维亚代表团团长、玻利维亚共和国副总统苏佐在发言中提到必须进行“公平的”国际贸易。
    苏佐指出裁减军备对于提高世界各国人民的福利将具有巨大的重要意义。他说，不仅大国和工业发达的国家，而且所谓小国和工业落后的国家也应该走上削减军事费用的道路。
    最后发言的是希腊代表、外交部长斯特凡诺普洛斯。他对大会决定不把塞浦路斯问题列入议程表示不安，他说这是“对一个想让人们听听自己的意见的小国人民关上大门”。
    他说这项决定是“违反宪章原则并且和这个组织的利益不相容的”。他对最近国际气氛得到改善和国与国之间的信任的重新建立表示欢迎，同时表示希望国际形势将继续沿着这个方向发展，使各国人民摆脱冷战，并使联合国能进行有成效的活动。
