    Wuhan's literary and art workers have recently been actively engaged in creative activities centered on raising revolutionary vigilance, eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, and safeguarding socialist construction. Their works have been welcomed by the broad masses.
    Art workers from units such as the Central South Academy of Fine Arts and the Hubei Provincial Art Studio have created six sets of comic strips, totaling one hundred and three pieces, which have been exhibited at the city's cartoon exhibition. The content of the comic strips includes "Zhang Shangqin - A Devil in a Painted Mask," "The Ugly Face of Zeng Zhuo, a Backbone Element of the Hu Feng Clique," and "Active Reporting of Special Agents by Family Women Zhu Fu Ruo and Li Huiwen," etc. Some of these comic strips have begun to be made into slides and will be shown in cinemas, cultural centers, and by film projection teams throughout the city. Propaganda posters created by the artists have been handed over to the Hubei People's Publishing House for mass printing, and a portion of those printed have recently been distributed by Xinhua Bookstore. In addition, large-scale propaganda posters created by the artists have also been erected at major traffic arteries.
    The creative activities of the city's professional and amateur poets, writers, and composers are also well coordinated. Poets and writers have created a large number of lyrics such as "Comrades, Let's Be Vigilant!" and "Eliminate Counter-Revolutionaries!" These lyrics have been compiled by the "Yangtze River Songs" editorial department into three issues of "Selected Anti-Revolutionary Lyrics" and distributed to composers for musical scoring. Songs completed since mid-August have been successively published, many of which are the works of workers, students, and office cadres. Some of these songs have become popular among the masses.

    武汉文艺界创作许多“肃反”斗争的作品
    武汉市的文艺工作者近来积极进行以提高革命警惕性，肃清一切反革命分子，保卫社会主义建设事业为主题的创作活动。他们的作品受到了广大群众的欢迎。
    中南美术专科学校、湖北省美术工作室等单位美术工作者创作的六套共一百零三幅连环画，已在全市举办的漫画展览会上展出。连环画的内容有“张尚勤——披着画皮的恶鬼”、“胡风骨干分子曾卓的丑恶嘴脸”、“积极检举特务的家庭妇女朱符若和李惠文”等。这些连环画有一部分已开始制成幻灯片，将在全市各电影院、文化馆和由电影放映队放映。美术家们创作的宣传画已交由湖北人民出版社大量印制，其中印好的一部分已在最近交新华书店发行。此外，美术家们创作的大型宣传画也已在交通要道竖立起来。
    全市专业和业余的诗人、作家和作曲家的创作活动也配合得较好。诗人和作家们创作了大量的如“同志，咱们警惕起来！”“肃清反革命”等歌词，这些歌词已由“长江歌声”编辑部集中编印了三期“肃反歌词选”，分发给作曲家谱曲。八月中旬起完成创作的歌曲已陆续刊印出来，其中有不少是工人、学生和机关干部的作品。这些歌曲有一部分已在群众中流行。　（新华社）
