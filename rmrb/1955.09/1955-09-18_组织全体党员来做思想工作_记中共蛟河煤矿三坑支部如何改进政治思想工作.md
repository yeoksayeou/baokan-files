    Organizing All Party Members to Do Ideological Work
    —How the CPC Jiaohe Coal Mine No. 3 Pit Branch Improved Political and Ideological Work
    CPC Jilin Provincial Committee Working Group
    The 170-meter coal mining face in the South Third Road of Jiaohe Coal Mine No. 3 Pit in Jilin Province is the largest coal mining face in the mine. Since May of this year, it has achieved regular cyclic operation, changed the backward production situation, and greatly increased coal production. Implementing regular cyclic operation in such a large coal mining face was unprecedented in the mine. The implementation of regular cyclic operation requires advanced administrative and technical management; it requires strict labor organization and division of labor; and workers must have a sense of overall coordination and cooperation. Therefore, this is a major reform in coal mine production. The improvement and strengthening of the political and ideological work of the No. 3 Pit Party Branch played a decisive role in ensuring the implementation of regular cyclic operation.
    Originally, the production of the 170-meter coal mining face was very chaotic, with many accidents, low worker attendance, and frequent failure to complete state plans. From January to April, regular cyclic operation was hardly achieved on any day. In order to solve this problem, the administrative side made many efforts to improve technical management and labor equipment, but production still did not follow a regular cycle, and the task was still not completed. In this situation, in order to ensure the completion of production tasks, the No. 3 Pit Party Branch suspended Party classes and education on labor discipline and safe production. It divided the cadres of the Party organization and mass organizations into three shifts to squat in the face with the administrative cadres to supervise production, going wherever there was a problem, busy all day long, running here and there. However, when this problem was solved, another problem arose; when old problems were solved, new problems emerged, and the production situation still did not improve in the slightest. Therefore, many cadres and technicians began to waver in their confidence in implementing cyclic operation. Technician Shi Mingqi said dogmatically: "If the South Third Road can achieve regular cyclic operation, cut off my head." Some leading cadres in the Party organization and administrative side also wavered, and a mood of mutual complaint arose. Administrative cadres said that the Party organization did not provide good guarantees; they said that the mine director was bureaucratic, only demanding tasks without helping to solve specific difficulties. The Party organization complained that administrative management was not done well, and complained that the trade union was not playing a role. Workers complained to workers, and workers complained to cadres.
    In mid-April, Zhang Songlin, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Jiaohe Mining Bureau Working Committee, was sent to this branch to inspect work. After listening to several reports from branch committee members and administrative cadres, Zhang Songlin felt that there were many problems, but she could not find the main problem for a while. She studied with the branch committee members and administrative cadres. Some people said that the technical equipment was not good and there were many accidents, which affected the completion of the task; however, the technical equipment of this face was better than that of other faces, and everyone agreed that this was not the main reason affecting production. Later, some people said that the large amount of water and poor working conditions affected the workers' labor morale; but the result of the research was that these difficulties could be overcome, because good working conditions are created by people's labor, and this was not the main problem affecting production. When two problems were not established, pit chief Jiang Yunpeng said: "In a word, it is the mine director's bureaucracy, not understanding the situation below, heavy tasks, tight requirements, only relying on issuing orders to direct production, and not helping to solve specific problems." Comrade Zhang Songlin asked: "These problems in the mine director's leadership can be raised and suggested to the mine to check and correct them, but how do you direct production?" He said: "The mine director orders me, so I have to order the teams and group leaders, and ask them for tasks. The mine director criticizes me, so I criticize them, anyway, it is a layer-by-layer deduction." Comrade Zhang Songlin guided everyone to study his ideological problems, and some leading staff members also expressed their similar thoughts. Everyone believed that when the task was not completed, the leading staff members had this negative thinking, and the workers could not be without ideological problems, especially since our ideological work was the weakest. Therefore, everyone turned around to study the ideological roots of several major problems affecting production. In this way, the truth of the problem was revealed. It turned out that what affected production was not only the problems in administrative management and technical management, but more importantly, the problem of people's ideology and work style. For example, the problem of many "chute" accidents was mainly because some people, in order to earn more wages, only focused on speed when laying the "chute," and laid it unevenly, often breaking the chain. The lack of unity between the three shifts and the failure to leave good working conditions for each other was the biggest problem. The reason was that each shift wanted to produce more cars and earn more piece-rate wages for themselves, so they did not follow the cyclic operation chart, and went wherever it was easy to work, which caused disunity between shifts and between workers. Therefore, after each shift took over, they had to drill holes and blast before hauling, which caused serious downtime. In order to rush the task, the leadership implemented the so-called "cross" operation, illegally working overtime, which affected the workers' health. The output was low, and the workers' income was also low. In addition, there were more difficulties in production, and the labor morale of some workers gradually declined. They were not at ease working in this face, so the attendance rate gradually decreased.
    When these ideological problems were brought out, the branch committee members suddenly realized. From these specific facts, they realized that: the problem was still in abandoning political and ideological work. Although they kept saying that they wanted to strengthen political and ideological work, they did not truly recognize its importance; if they did not educate cadres to overcome negative thoughts and improve their work style, and did not raise the socialist ideological awareness of the workers, no matter how good the equipment was, there would be no improvement in production. Therefore, under the guidance of the higher Party committee, the branch committee organized Party members and cadres to study the relevant documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, and combined this with checking and criticizing the erroneous tendency of neglecting political and ideological work. First, the branch committee checked the errors of abandoning political and ideological work and its bad consequences; then, it specifically analyzed the individualism, conservative thinking, and so on that existed inside and outside the Party. There were also many shortcomings in the daily work of the branch committee. In the past, the branch committee did little individual education for Party members, and at the same time, it did not pay attention to strengthening the political and ideological work of the Party organization through the daily activities of Party members and activists, but only relied on the Party member congress to do work. Then, the branch committee convened a Party member congress, reported the branch committee's self-criticism to all Party members, organized all Party members to launch discussions, and continued to expose and criticize the shortcomings and errors in the branch's work. In his report, the branch secretary pointed out that most Party members were able to work hard, going wherever there were difficulties, especially Party member Zhou Huacheng, who not only worked hard himself, but also united and led the surrounding masses. However, most Party members only worked hard themselves and did not know how or did not pay attention to doing mass work. This was because the branch committee did not mobilize and organize Party members to do ideological work, and did not teach Party members how to do mass work. This Party member congress was very educational for all Party members and activists attending the meeting. Both the pit chief and deputy pit chief examined their mistakes of not relying on the leadership of the Party, not paying attention to doing political and ideological work, and only relying on administrative orders to direct production. Most Party members also made self-criticisms at the meeting, and also exposed and criticized the shortcomings and errors of the branch committee and administrative leaders. In their speeches, Party members unanimously believed that the shortcomings in the work of the branch were inseparable from the lack of concern for the Party's work by many Party members, and expressed that they would strive to do the Party's work well. This Party member congress passed a resolution on strengthening political and ideological work, requiring all Party members to take the lead in overcoming individualism, actively doing political and ideological work, and fighting against all erroneous thoughts; exemplarily implement operating procedures, lead the masses of their teams to leave good conditions for the next shift, and set a good example for the masses; Party member cadres should lead non-Party cadres to go deep into the grassroots, overcome commandism, patiently help lower-level cadres solve specific difficulties, check themselves first when there are problems, and not complain about others; the resolution also required each Party member to pay attention to cultivating activists, and each person guaranteed to specifically help three non-Party staff members or workers.
    Party members and the masses actively implemented the resolutions of this Party member congress. The branch committee divided the workers' thoughts into three types, specifically assigned them to each Party group, and taught each Party member the methods to solve these ideological problems; it organized propagandists to conduct ideological education on overall collaboration to all workers; it organized workers to discuss the harm of each team not leaving good conditions for each other to themselves and to the entire production. During the discussion, Party members took the lead in examining their erroneous thoughts of not wanting to leave conditions for the next shift, and used the fact that poor working conditions after starting work affected production to explain the principle that building socialism depends on collective labor, unity, and mutual assistance. At the same time, it widely introduced to the workers the exemplary behavior and advanced thinking of Party members Zhou Huacheng and Zhang Yun, who went wherever there were difficulties and took care of the overall interests. This was very educational for the workers. Some workers said: "Party member Zhang Yun is really good, we should learn from his spirit of overcoming difficulties." In order to implement the resolutions of the branch congress, Party member Zhang Yao took the initiative to unite five activists to promote the experience of coal cutting machine wearing iron shoes and mastering roof changes, so that the efficiency of the coal cutting machine increased from 36 meters per shift to 70 meters. Many Party members took the lead in laboring in production, and after work, they also visited the homes of workers to understand the workers' family life and ideological dynamics, and then reported to the branch. Some Party members also took the initiative to take out their own money to help the workers with the most difficult lives. Probationary Party member Zhao Chunting used to be absent from work due to minor illnesses. Recently, his foot was injured at work. Before it was fully healed, he went to work and went to the most difficult places to work, giving the easy work to the masses. His actions had a great impact on those workers who were absent from work due to minor illnesses.
    However, because the number of Party members was small, the workers were numerous and scattered, and the original ideological problems were numerous and complex, so after solving this problem today, that problem appeared tomorrow, and the results of the work could not be consolidated. According to this situation, the branch, according to the resolution of the Party member congress, mobilized Party members to cultivate non-Party activists, and led the activists to do political and ideological work together. The branch convened several meetings of activists, conducted ideological education to them, improved their ideological awareness, educated them to care about production and care about the masses, and specifically taught them the methods of doing ideological work. The number of activists increased from the original twelve to twenty-two. They could not only do political and ideological work, but also play a leading role among the masses. Under the specific help and leading influence of Party members and activists, thirteen backward-thinking workers improved their awareness and increased their enthusiasm for labor. Coal miner Ding Wenxiu was very backward. Now, after everyone's help, he has become an advanced worker and was elected as the group leader of the work type. He can also use the facts of his own ideological transformation to educate the surrounding masses. Coal miner Tong Chaoming used to not care about others. Sometimes his production morale was not normal. With the help of Party member Zhou Huacheng, he not only transformed himself, but also took the initiative to help Song Jishan, who was uneasy about production and repeatedly asked for a job transfer, to transform. Activists and Party members worked together to persuade the workers in their teams to leave good conditions for the next shift, which played a great role in solving the problem of disunity between teams. Some workers advocated not leaving conditions for the next shift, so they patiently persuaded them. If the workers did not listen, they would do it themselves. Later, many workers saw them working so selflessly and could not bear to let them do it themselves. In this way, each team gradually left conditions for each other, and the phenomenon of downtime when starting work was greatly reduced. The output of each team rose rapidly, and the workers' wage income also increased accordingly. In this way, everyone truly realized the benefits of unity and cooperation. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm for labor gradually increased, accidents decreased, and production gradually moved towards regular cyclic operation.
    With the universal improvement of workers' ideological awareness, the branch guided the trade union to launch a labor competition among all workers in the field. The branch focused on the Qin Hongji group, specifically helping this group to formulate guarantee conditions, and specifically helping to organize the implementation. Then the branch organized to introduce their practices and called on everyone to learn from them. In the labor competition, the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology and improving technology was very high. At a worker symposium jointly convened by the branch and the administration, everyone collectively studied and proposed a suggestion to change the roof to "single close stacking pillars." After adopting this suggestion, not only was safe production guaranteed, but also the manual labor for recovering wood piles was reduced from 40 per shift to 15, and the working time was reduced from 12 hours to 6 hours. The timber recovery rate increased from 50% to 80%. Many workers realized the harm of conservative thinking from these facts.
    After that, although problems continued to occur in production, the workers were able to take the initiative and solve them in a timely manner, ensuring that production was not affected. From the end of April, the production of the entire field began to move towards regular cyclic operation. In May, 26 cycles were completed, and in June, 29 cycles were completed. Due to the regular cyclic operation, labor productivity was greatly improved, reducing 30 workers, and also increasing a large amount of wealth for the country. In May, the cost was reduced to 80.5% of the national target, and in June, it was reduced to 80.4%. Due to the increased production volume, the workers' wages also increased greatly. In May, the average worker's wage increased by 64% compared with the basic wage. This coal mining face has won the cycle award for three consecutive months according to the standards stipulated by the state coal mining cycle rate.

    组织全体党员来做思想工作
    ——记中共蛟河煤矿三坑支部如何改进政治思想工作
    中共吉林省委工作组
    吉林蛟河煤矿三坑南三道一百七十公尺采煤场子，是该矿最大的一个采煤场子。从今年五月份起，作到了正规的循环作业，改变了生产落后的状况，大大提高了采煤量。在这样大的采煤场子实行正规的循环作业，还是该矿从来没有过的。实行正规的循环作业，需要有先进的行政管理和技术管理；要有严密的劳动组织和分工；工人要有互相配合和协作的整体思想。因此，这是煤矿生产上的一项重要改革。三坑党支部政治思想工作的改进和加强，对保证实行正规的循环作业起了决定性的作用。
    原来一百七十公尺采煤场子的生产很混乱，事故多，工人出勤率低，经常完不成国家计划，从一月到四月，几乎没有一天能作到正规循环作业。行政方面为了解决这个问题，在改进技术管理、劳动设备等方面，曾做了不少的努力，但生产还走不上正规的循环，任务还是完不成。在这种情况下，三坑党支部为了保证完成生产任务，停止了党课、劳动纪律和安全生产的教育，把党组织和群众团体的干部分为三班跟行政干部一起蹲在场子里监督生产，哪儿有问题就到哪儿去，成天忙忙碌碌，东奔西走。但是，这个问题解决了，那个问题又来了，老问题解决了，又出来新问题了，生产状况仍旧没有丝毫好转。因此，有不少干部和技术人员对实行循环作业动摇起来。技术员石鸣岐武断地说：“南三道要走上正规循环，割我的脑袋。”党组织和行政方面的部分领导干部也动摇了，产生了互相埋怨的情绪。行政干部说党组织保证的不好；说矿长官僚主义，光要求任务不帮助解决具体困难。党组织埋怨行政管理工作做的不好，埋怨工会不起作用，工人和工人，工人和干部之间也互相埋怨。
    四月中旬，中共蛟河矿务局工作委员会派副书记张松林到这个支部来检查工作。张松林听了支部委员和行政干部的几次汇报，感到问题很多，但一时也找不出主要问题在哪里，她就同支部委员、行政干部一起研究。有人说技术设备不好，事故多，影响完成任务；可是这个场子的技术设备比其他场子还要好一些，大家一致认为这不是影响生产的主要原因。随后又有人说淋头水大、作业条件不好因而影响了工人劳动情绪；但研究的结果认为这些困难都是可以克服的，因为好的劳动条件是人的劳动创造出来的，这也不是影响生产的主要问题。连着两个问题都没成立，坑长姜云鹏说：“一句话，就是矿长官僚主义，不了解下情，任务重，要求的紧，光靠下命令指挥生产，不帮助解决具体问题。”张松林同志问：“矿长领导上的这些问题可以提出来，建议矿里检查、纠正，但你是怎样指挥生产的呢？”他说：“矿长命令我，我就得命令班、组长，管他们要任务呗。矿长批评我，我就批评他们，反正是一层扣一层。”张松林同志就引导大家研究他这种思想问题，有的领导工作人员也说出了自己的类似的思想。大家认为，完不成任务时，领导工作人员都有这种消极思想，工人当中也不能没有思想问题，何况咱们的思想工作最薄弱呢。于是，大家又反过来研究几个影响生产的主要问题产生的思想根源。这样一来，问题的真相揭露出来了。原来影响生产的不仅是行政管理和技术管理上的问题，更为重要的是人的思想作风问题。例如，“溜子”事故多的问题，主要是因为有些人为了多挣工资，在铺“溜子”时光图快，铺的不平，常常断链子。三班之间不团结，互不留好作业条件，这是最大的问题。原因是各班都为自己多出车，多挣计件工资，就不按循环作业图表办事，哪儿好干就到哪去干，这样就造成了班和班之间、工人和工人之间不团结。因此，每班接班后，都得现打眼、放炮，然后出车，这就造成了严重的窝工。领导上为赶任务，就实行所谓“交叉”作业，非法地加班加点，影响了工人的身体健康。产量低、工人的收入也就低，加上生产上的困难多一些，有些工人劳动情绪就渐渐地低落下来，不安心在这个场子工作，所以出勤率也就渐渐地下降。
    当把这些思想问题摆出来后，支部委员们恍然大悟了。他们从这些具体事实里认识到：毛病还是在于放弃了政治思想工作，虽然不断地说要加强政治思想工作，但没有真正认识到它的重要性；如果不教育干部克服消极思想改进工作作风，不提高职工的社会主义思想觉悟，就是设备再好，生产也不会有什么改进。于是，支部委员会在上级党委的指导下，组织党员干部学习有关党的四中全会决议文件，结合检查、批判忽视政治思想工作的错误倾向。首先，支部委员会检查了放弃政治思想工作的错误及其恶果；然后具体地分析了党内外存在的个人主义、保守思想等。支委会的日常工作中缺点也很多，支委会过去对党员个别教育少，同时又不注意通过党员、积极分子的日常活动来加强党组织的政治思想工作，而只是依靠党员大会来做工作。接着，支委会召开了党员大会，向全体党员报告了支委会的检查，组织全体党员展开讨论，继续揭发和批判支部工作中的缺点、错误。支部书记在报告中指出：大多数党员都是能够艰苦地劳动的，哪里有困难就到哪里去干，特别是党员周化成，不仅自己艰苦劳动，还能团结、带动周围的群众。但多数党员只是自己好好干，不会或不注意做群众工作。这是因为支委会没发动和组织党员做思想工作，没教给党员做群众工作的方法。这次支部大会对全体党员和列席会议的积极分子教育很大。正副坑长在会上都检查了自己不依靠党的领导、不注意做政治思想工作、单靠行政命令指挥生产的错误。多数党员在会上也做了检讨，还揭发和批判了支委会和行政领导工作人员的缺点和错误。党员在发言中一致认为支部工作有缺点是同不少党员不关心党的工作分不开的，表示要努力做好党的工作。这次支部大会就加强政治思想工作问题通过一项决议，要求全体党员以身作则地克服个人主义，积极做好政治思想工作，同一切错误思想作斗争；模范地执行操作规程，带动本班的群众给下班留好条件，给群众做好榜样；党员干部要带动非党干部深入基层，克服命令主义，耐心帮助下级干部解决具体困难，有问题先检查自己，不埋怨别人；决议并要求每个党员都注意培养积极分子，每人保证具体帮助三名非党工作人员或工人。
    党员群众执行这次支部大会的决议是积极的。支委会把职工思想划分为三种类型，具体地布置到各党小组，并教给了各个党员解决这些思想问题的方法；组织宣传员向全体工人进行整体协作的思想教育；组织工人讨论各班互不留好条件对自己、对整个生产的害处。在讨论中间，党员都带头检查自己不愿给下班留条件的错误思想，并用上班后因作业条件不好而影响生产的事实，说明建设社会主义要依靠集体劳动团结互助的道理。同时，广泛地向工人群众介绍了党员周化成、张云哪有困难到哪去干、顾全整体利益的模范行为和先进思想。这对工人的教育意义很大，有的工人说：“张云这个党员真是好样的，我们应该学习他克服困难的精神。”党员张尧为了贯彻支部大会决议，主动地团结了五名积极分子推广截煤机穿铁鞋、掌握顶板变化的经验，使截煤机效率由每小班三十六公尺提高到七十公尺。不少党员在生产中带头劳动，下班后还到工人家里去访问，了解工人的家庭生活情况、思想动态，然后向支部汇报。还有的党员主动拿出自己的钱去帮助生活最困难的工人。候补党员赵春廷原来有点小毛病就欠勤。最近，他的脚因工负了伤，没等全好就上班了，还到最艰苦的地方去干活，把好干的活让给群众。他的行动对那些有点小毛病就欠勤的工人影响很大。
    但是，因为党员的人数少，工人多而且分散，加上原来的思想问题又多又复杂，所以今天解决了这个问题，明天又出现了那个问题，工作成果巩固不住。支部根据这种情况，就根据党员大会的决议，发动党员培养非党积极分子，带动积极分子一道做政治思想工作。支部召开了几次积极分子会议，向他们进行思想教育，提高他们的思想觉悟，教育他们关心生产、关心群众，具体地教给他们做思想工作的方法。积极分子由原来的十二名发展到二十二名，他们不仅能做政治思想工作，还能在群众中起带头作用。有十三名思想落后的工人，在党员和积极分子的具体帮助和带头影响下，提高了觉悟，劳动积极性提高了。采煤工人丁文秀原来很落后，经过大家的帮助，现在已经变成先进的工人，被选为工种小组长，他还能用自己思想转变的事实去教育周围的群众。采煤工人佟朝明过去一向是不管别人，有时生产情绪不够正常，经党员周化成的帮助，不但自己转变了，还主动地帮助不安心生产、屡次要求调动工作的宋吉山有了转变。积极分子和党员一起说服本班的工人给下班留好条件，对于解决班和班之间的不团结问题起了很大作用。有的工人主张不给下班留条件，他们就耐心地说服，工人不听就自己干。后来，有不少工人看他们这样忘我地劳动，也不忍心让他们自己干了。这样，渐渐地各班都互相留条件了，上班就窝工的现象大大减少，各班的产量迅速上升，工人的工资收入也随着增加。这样，大家才真正认识到团结合作的好处。于是，工人的劳动积极性渐渐地高涨起来，事故减少，生产渐渐地朝着正规循环的方向走去。
    随着工人的思想觉悟普遍提高，支部指导工会发动全场职工展开了劳动竞赛。支部以秦洪吉小组为重点，具体帮助这个小组制定保证条件，并具体帮助组织实现。然后支部又组织介绍他们的做法，号召大家向他们学习。在劳动竞赛中，工人学习技术、改进技术的情绪很高。在一次支部和行政共同召开的工人座谈会上，大家集体研究提出一项把顶板改为“单密堆支柱”的建议，采纳了这项建议后，不仅保证了安全生产，还使回收木垛的人工由过去的每班四十个减少到十五个，而且工作时间由十二小时减少到六小时，坑木回收率由百分之五十提高到百分之八十。许多工人从这些事实中认识到了保守思想的害处。
    以后，虽然生产上也不断地发生问题，但是工人们能够主动地、及时地来研究解决，保证了生产不受影响。从四月底，全场的生产便开始走上了正规的循环作业，五月份走了二十六个循环，六月份走了二十九个循环。由于走上了正规的循环作业，劳动生产率大大提高，减少了三十名工人，还给国家增产了大量财富。五月份成本降低到国家指标的百分之八十点五，六月份降低到百分之八十点四。由于生产量提高了，工人的工资也大有增长，五月份工人工资平均比基本工资提高百分之六十四。这个采煤场子根据国家采煤循环率规定的标准，已连续三个月获得了循环奖励。
