    Ministry of Agriculture Convenes National Cotton Production Conference
    To Study Measures for Completing Cotton Production Increase Tasks in the Five-Year Plan
    (Xinhua News Agency) Specific measures for completing the cotton production increase tasks in the First Five-Year Plan have been discussed at the National Cotton Production Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture. The general requirements of these measures are to vigorously increase the yield per unit area, expand cotton fields in a planned way, and gradually develop mechanical cultivation and mechanical irrigation on the basis of cooperation. As cotton-growing areas take the lead in cooperation, they should gradually achieve mechanization first.
    According to the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, by 1957, the national cotton planting area should reach 95 million mu, an increase of 11.3644 million mu compared with 1952, and the total output should be 32.7 million dan, an increase of 6.6 million dan compared with 1952. However, in the first two years of the First Five-Year Plan (1953 and 1954), cotton production was reduced due to disasters, and the plan was not completed, with the output even decreasing compared with 1952. It is estimated that the plan can be completed in 1955, but it will only be equivalent to the production level of 1952. Therefore, it is a very arduous task to complete the cotton production increase tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan within the two years of 1956 and 1957. The meeting believes that the planning for cotton-growing areas in 1956 and 1957 should consolidate and improve the old cotton-growing areas, and develop and effectively manage new cotton-growing areas in a planned way, in order to prepare for further development of cotton production in the future. From a national perspective, the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi in the Yellow River basin and Jiangsu Province are still the focus of expanding cotton fields, and cotton fields in the cotton-wheat double-cropping areas along the Yangtze River and in the provinces south of the Yangtze River should also be vigorously managed. Coastal reclamation areas and mountainous areas in Sichuan can continue to expand cotton planting. The cotton-growing areas in Northeast China should be actively restored to increase yields. Xinjiang Province and the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province have large areas of wasteland available for reclamation and cotton planting, which are China's future new cotton bases, and preparations for development should be actively made. Yunnan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces are suitable for growing kapok, and should also be actively developed. The meeting requested that each province conduct cotton-growing area planning separately, and make full use of natural conditions to develop the production of other fiber crops.
    The meeting believes that it is necessary to further implement various policies related to rewarding cotton planting in order to improve farmers' enthusiasm for production. At the same time, in order to increase the yield per unit area of cotton fields, the state will expand the area of mechanical cultivation in cotton-growing areas, reaching 10 million mu by 1957, and widely promote double-wheel double-share plows, cultivators, cotton sowing machines, etc. The area of irrigation will be expanded in cotton-growing areas, reaching about 20 million mu by 1957. It is also necessary to further prevent and control cotton pests and diseases; increase fertilizer application and expand the application area of chemical fertilizers; mobilize farmers to select and retain cotton seeds themselves, and promote improved cotton varieties; and strengthen technical guidance to cotton-growing areas. In order to further base cotton production increase on science, the meeting also discussed specific measures to strengthen cotton experiment and research work, and gradually establish a cotton improved variety breeding system.

    农业部召开全国棉产工作会议
    研究完成五年计划中棉花增产任务的措施
    据新华社讯关于完成第一个五年计划中棉花增产任务的具体措施，已在农业部召开的全国棉产工作会议上进行了讨论。这些措施的总要求是必须大力提高单位面积产量，有计划地扩大棉田，并在合作化的基础上逐步发展机械耕作和机械灌溉。随着棉区先一步合作化，逐步做到先一步机械化。
    根据发展国民经济第一个五年计划中的规定，到一九五七年，全国棉花播种面积要达到九千五百万亩，比一九五二年增加一千一百三十六万四千亩，总产量三千二百七十万担，比一九五二年增加六百六十万担。但是，第一个五年计划的头两年（一九五三年、一九五四年），棉花生产都因灾减产，没有完成计划，比一九五二年的产量还减少了；一九五五年预计可以按计划完成，但也只相当于一九五二年的生产水平。因此要在一九五六年、一九五七年两年之内，完成五年计划所规定的棉花增产的任务，是十分艰巨的。会议认为一九五六年、一九五七年两年棉区的规划，应该是巩固和提高老棉区，并有计划地发展和切实经营新棉区，为将来进一步发展棉花生产作好准备。从全国范围来看，黄河流域河北、山东、河南、山西、陕西各省及江苏等省仍为扩大棉田的重点，对长江沿岸及江南各省棉麦两熟地区的棉田也应大力经营。沿海垦区和四川山地可继续扩大植棉。东北棉区应积极恢复，提高产量。新疆省和甘肃省的河西走廊，有大片荒地可供开垦植棉，是我国未来的新的棉花基地，应该积极准备开发。云南、福建、广东、广西等省适宜种植木棉，也应该积极发展。会议要求各省分别进行棉区规划，并且充分利用自然条件，发展其他纤维作物的生产。
    会议认为必须进一步贯彻有关奖励植棉的各项政策，以提高农民的生产积极性。同时国家为了提高棉田的单位面积产量，将在棉区扩大机械耕作的面积，到一九五七年要达到一千万亩，并大量推广双轮双铧犁、中耕器、棉花播种机等。在棉区扩大灌溉的面积，到一九五七年将达到二千万亩左右。还要进一步防治棉花病虫害；增施肥料，扩大化学肥料的施用面积；发动农民自己选留棉花种籽，推广棉花良种；加强对棉区的技术指导。为了将棉花增产进一步建立在科学的基础上，会议还讨论了加强棉花试验研究工作，以及逐步建立棉花良种繁育制度的具体办法。
