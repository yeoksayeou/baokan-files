    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Promotes the New Mongolian Script
    The People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established a Mongolian Script Reform Committee, preparing to promote the New Mongolian script over a period of six years. By May 1962 (the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), the entire region will completely use the New Mongolian script.
    The New Mongolian script was developed by the Mongolian People's Republic. Since the victory of the people's revolution in 1921, the Mongolian People's Republic has been carrying out script reform work. From 1946, the New Mongolian script replaced the old Mongolian script, thereby rapidly improving the people's cultural level. The New Mongolian script has many advantages over the old Mongolian script: it is consistent with the language, has no changes in glyphs, and is written horizontally, which is very convenient for writing mathematical, chemical, physical, and other formulas.
    Since 1949, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been publishing materials related to the promotion and introduction of the New Mongolian script in a planned way, training a number of New Mongolian script teachers, and establishing the Mongolian Language Research Association in July 1953, actively carrying out various preparations and research work for the promotion of the New Mongolian script.

    内蒙古自治区推行新蒙文
    内蒙古自治区人民委员会成立了蒙古文字改革委员会，准备以六年时间推行新蒙文，到一九六二年五月（内蒙古自治区成立十五周年）以后，全区完全使用新蒙文。
    新蒙文是蒙古人民共和国研究出来的。蒙古人民共和国自一九二一年人民革命胜利以后，就进行文字改革工作。从一九四六年起，用新蒙文代替旧蒙文，从而迅速提高了人民的文化水平。新蒙文较旧蒙文有许多优点，它和语言一致，没有字形的变化，而且是横写的，书写数学、化学、物理等公式很方便。
    内蒙古自治区自一九四九年以来，就有计划地出版有关宣传介绍新蒙文的资料，培养了一部分新蒙文师资，并在一九五三年七月成立了蒙古语文研究会，积极进行推行新蒙文的各项准备和研究工作。　（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
