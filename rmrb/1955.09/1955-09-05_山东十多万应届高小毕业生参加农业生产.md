In Shandong Province, over 100,000 recent elementary school graduates have participated in agricultural production. Local governments, Party, and Communist Youth League organizations have made specific arrangements for these graduates. In Jiaoxian County's 14th District, various departments have formulated plans for the graduates' work and study. The district health center plans to train 50 health workers, the district accounting instructors will train 60 cooperative bookkeepers, the civil schools will select 70 to serve as "little teachers," and the cultural center plans to train a group of propagandists. In Zibo City's Zhangzhuang Village, an agricultural production cooperative accounting study class has been established, organizing 23 elementary school graduates from the village for learning. Since its establishment in early August, eleven people in this accounting study class have been able to record simple accounts. With the assistance of the Propaganda Department of the Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jiaozhou Prefectural Radio Station held a training class for agricultural production cooperative radio operators from August 17th to 24th. Eighty-nine agricultural production cooperative radio operators from various counties, all of whom are elementary school graduates participating in agricultural production, participated in the training class.

In Shandong Province, over 500,000 elementary school graduates from 1953 and 1954 who were unable to continue their education have mostly participated in agricultural production and other work. These graduates have become an important force in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the Zhang Shirui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jimo County, Zhang Shijiang and six other elementary school graduates, led by veteran farmer Zhang Shigan, formed an agricultural technology group to conduct agricultural production research. They cultivated a large number of "Fangza No. 2" superior corn seeds for the cooperative and used scientific methods to control pests and prune apple trees. They also purchased many books on agricultural science to study.

Many elementary school graduates also persisted in their spare-time studies while participating in agricultural production. In the Song Zongguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kunlun County's 3rd District, 35 elementary school graduates have begun reviewing junior high school courses, and 23 have joined regular civil schools.

    山东十多万应届高小毕业生参加农业生产
    山东省有十多万应届高小毕业生参加了农业生产。各地政府和党、团组织对参加农业生产的应届高小毕业生都作了具体的安排。胶县十四区由各部门订出了安排毕业生工作和学习的计划，其中区卫生所准备培养卫生员五十人，区会计辅导员培养合作社记账员六十人，民校挑选七十人担任小先生，文化馆计划培养一批宣传员。淄博市张庄村并成立了一个农业生产合作社会计学习班，组织张庄村二十三名高小毕业生进行学习。这个会计学习班自八月上旬开办以来，已有十一人能够记简单的账目了。胶州专区收音站在中共胶州地委宣传部的协助下，从八月十七日到二十四日举办了一期农业生产合作社收音员训练班，参加训练班的有各县农业生产合作社收音员八十九人，他们都是参加农业生产的高小毕业生。
    山东省一九五三年和一九五四年不能升学的高小毕业生共有五十多万人，绝大部分已参加了农业生产和其他各项工作。这些高小毕业生已成为农业生产和互助合作运动中的一支重要力量。即墨县张式瑞农业生产合作社里张式讲等七个高小毕业生在老农民张式玕的带领下组成了一个农业技术组，进行农业生产的研究工作，他们为合作社培植出大量的“坊杂二号”玉米良种，并使用科学方法给苹果树除虫、整枝。同时购买了不少农业科学知识的书籍来进行学习。　
  　许多高小毕业生在参加农业生产的同时，还坚持了业余学习。昆仑县三区宋宗国农业生产合作社的高小毕业生有三十五人已经开始复习初中课程，有二十三人参加了常年民校。（新华社）
