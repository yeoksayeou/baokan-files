Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: The 87th Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress concluded in Southport on the 9th.

    At the meeting on the 7th, the congress unanimously passed a resolution calling for steps to be taken to reduce the cost of living.

    At the meeting on the 7th, a proposal to shorten the work week was also discussed. Supporters of the proposal pointed out that British workers now have to work overtime to maintain their living standards. They emphasized that extending the working day through overtime not only means greater exploitation but also causes a sharp increase in industrial accidents. The General Council opposed this proposal. In the vote, 3,300,300 votes were in favor, and 3,664,000 votes were against.

    A heated debate took place on the issue of wages. The secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Mr. Haxell, put forward a proposal condemning all forms of restrictions on wage increase demands. He refuted the arguments of those advocating wage restrictions who said that wage increases would raise prices and harm British exports. This proposal was supported by other trade union organizations. The leadership of the Transport and General Workers' Union put forward an amendment that greatly weakened the strongly worded proposal put forward by the Electrical Trades Union. The amendment was supported by the General Council and passed by 5,344,000 votes to 2,699,000 votes.

    Mr. Becu, the representative of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, spoke near the end of the afternoon meeting on the 7th, opposing any cooperation with the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    At the morning meeting on the 8th, the discussion on the issue of nationalization began. The proposal put forward by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, supported by three other trade unions, demanded that the leadership bodies of the Trades Union Congress and the Labor Party draft nationalization plans for the machine manufacturing, chemical, and construction industries. Speakers in the discussion condemned the activities of large monopoly capital.

    Then the international issues were discussed, and a fierce struggle took place between the left and right wings of the Trades Union Congress during the discussion. Arthur Horner, the General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, put forward a proposal demanding that the General Council "take all necessary measures to hold negotiations with corresponding organizations to guarantee the greatest international unity of the working class of all countries." When Mr. Horner put forward the proposal, he said: "Workers all over the world should unite and struggle for peace and to improve material welfare." His speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause and cheers of approval.

    The afternoon meeting on the 8th unanimously passed a resolution emphasizing the necessity of concluding an international agreement on destroying all stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen weapons and banning the production and use of such weapons. The resolution also demanded that the British government immediately take the initiative to strive to reach an agreement on banning the continued testing of atomic weapons.

    The Trades Union Congress also discussed a proposal put forward by Jack Stanley, the General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, on entrusting the General Council to discuss establishing closer ties between the trade unions of the two countries with the Soviet trade unions. Finlay Hart, the president of the United Society of Boilermakers, Blacksmiths, Shipbuilders and Structural Workers, expressed support for this proposal. He said that good relations between East and West are necessary for guaranteeing lasting peace.

    The General Council, aware that the British trade union members supported establishing good relations with the Soviet trade unions, therefore played tricks to evade voting on this proposal. In the end, this proposal was not voted on.

    The congress unanimously passed a resolution on the 8th condemning all racial discrimination and demanding that the General Council pay special attention to the problems arising from the influx of workers of other races into Britain. At the closing meeting on the 9th, many resolutions calling for easing international tensions were passed. Among them was a resolution demanding that the British government support the admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. Francis, the representative of the Musicians' Union, said when putting forward this draft resolution: "It is extremely absurd to deprive the representatives of a quarter of the world's population of their seat in the United Nations while allowing a gang of adventurers whose sole pillar is foreign aid to enter the United Nations."

    Another resolution called for broadly striving to end the Cold War forever through the Four Power talks. There was also a resolution demanding that the government immediately take measures to shorten the term of military service.

    The annual meeting expressed its dissatisfaction in a resolution with the government authorities' lack of concern for the living conditions of the working people.

    Many delegates supported the proposal of the Fire Brigades Union, which called for the establishment of a unified and peace-loving Germany and condemned the arming of West Germany. However, the General Council opposed this proposal, its reason being that the decision to arm Germany was a "fait accompli". 3,212,000 votes were in favor of this proposal, and 4,402,000 votes were against.

    The congress elected Mr. Beard, the secretary of the United Patternmakers Association, as the chairman of the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress.

    Annual meeting observers and even the bourgeois newspapers have pointed out that at this annual meeting, the General Council of the Trades Union Congress forced the annual meeting to accept very unrealistic resolutions on many issues. For example, the General Council rejected the proposal put forward by the Electrical Trades Union condemning the policy of freezing wages. The General Council forced the annual meeting to amend the charter of the Trades Union Congress, thus enabling itself to obtain the right to decide on strike issues instead of the trade unions. It is worth noting that the proposal put forward by the National Union of Mineworkers demanding to establish working contacts with trade unions of other countries obtained nearly 3.5 million votes at this annual meeting. However, at last year's annual meeting, the number of votes obtained for the proposal on this issue was less than 2 million.

    Annual meeting observers pointed out that the numerous proposals put forward by the British working people at the annual meeting demanding that the General Council implement a policy of consolidating international peace illustrate their desire for peace.

    英国职工大会第八十七届年会闭幕
    通过多项号召缓和国际紧张局势的决议
    职工大会最高委员会强迫年会通过一些不现实的决议
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社讯：英国职工大会第八十七届年会九日在南港闭幕。
    在七日会议上，大会一致通过一项决议，要求采取步骤来减少生活费用。
    在七日的会议上，也讨论了要求缩短工作周的一个提案。这个提案的支持者指出，现在英国工人必须加班工作来维持他们的生活水平。他们强调说，通过加班来延长工作日不仅意味着更大的剥削，而且引起工业事故急剧增加。最高委员会反对这个提案。表决时有三百三十万零三千票赞成，三百六十六万四千票反对。
    在工资问题上进行了激烈的辩论。电气工会书记赫泽尔提出了一项提案，谴责用一切形式限制增加工资的要求。他驳斥了主张限制工资的人们说什么增加工资会抬高物价和损害英国出口的论据。这项提案得到其他工会组织的支持。送货工人工会的领导方面提出了一项修正案，这项修正案大大削弱了电气工会提出的措辞坚决的提案。修正案得到最高委员会的支持，并且以五百三十四万四千票对二百六十九万九千票被通过。
    “国际自由工会联合会”的代表贝库在大会七日下午会议快结束时发言，反对同世界工会联合会进行任何合作。
    在八日上午会议上，开始讨论国有化问题。得到其他三个工会支持的英国混合机械工业工会提出的提案，要求职工大会和工党的领导机构草拟关于机器制造、化学和建筑工业部门的国有化计划。在讨论中发言的人谴责了大垄断资本的活动。
    接着讨论国际问题，职工大会的左派和右派在讨论当中发生激烈的斗争。英国全国矿工联盟总书记霍尔纳提出一项提案，要求最高委员会“采取一切必要的措施，同相应的组织举行谈判，以保障各国工人阶级最大的国际团结”。霍尔纳在提出提案时说：“全世界的工人应当团结起来，为争取和平和提高物质福利而斗争。”他的发言屡次为鼓掌声和赞同的欢呼声所打断。
    八日下午会议一致通过一项决议，着重指出缔结一项关于销毁一切原子武器和氢武器储备以及禁止这种武器的生产和使用的国际协定的必要性。决议还要求英国政府立刻采取主动，力求达成关于禁止继续试验原子武器的协定。
    职工大会还讨论了建筑工程工会总书记杰克·斯坦莱提出的关于委托最高委员会同苏联工会商谈两国工会之间建立更紧密的联系问题的提案。联合锅炉制造工人与钢铁造船工人工会主席芬莱·哈特对这个提案表示支持。他说，东西方之间的良好关系对保障持久和平是必要的。
    最高委员会意识到英国工会会员群众拥护同苏联工会建立良好关系，因此就玩弄花样，规避对这个提案进行表决。最后这个提案没有得到表决。
    八日大会一致通过决议，谴责一切种族歧视，并且要求最高委员会特别重视由于其他种族的工人流入英国而产生的问题。在九日闭幕会议上，通过了许多号召缓和国际紧张局势的决议。其中有一项决议要求英国政府支持接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国。音乐工作者工会代表弗伦西斯在提出这项决议案时说：“剥夺了世界四分之一人口的代表在联合国的席位，同时却让以外国援助为唯一支柱的冒险分子匪帮进入联合国，这是极其荒谬的。”
    另一项决议号召广泛地争取通过四国会谈来永远地结束冷战。还有一项决议要求政府立即采取措施来缩短兵役期限。
    年会在一项决议中对于政府当局对劳动人民的居住情况不够关心这一点表示不满。
    许多代表支持救火员工会的提案，这个提案号召建立统一的、爱好和平的德国，并且谴责武装西德。但是，最高委员会反对这项提案，它的理由是：武装德国的决定是“既成事实”。投票赞成这项提案的有三百二十一万二千票，反对的有四百四十万二千票。　　大会选出联合造模工人工会书记比尔德为英国职工大会最高委员会主席。　
　  年会观察家以至于资产阶级报纸都指出：在这届年会上，职工大会最高委员会在许多问题上强迫年会接受了非常不现实的决议。例如，最高委员会否决了电气工会提出的谴责冻结工资政策的提案。最高委员会强迫年会修改职工大会的章程，而使自己获得代替工会决定罢工问题的权利。值得注意的是：全国矿工联盟提出的要求同其他国家的工会建立事务联系的提案，在本届年会上取得了将近三百五十万票。而在去年的年会上，关于这个问题的提案所获得的票数还不到两百万。
    年会观察家指出：英国劳动人民在年会上提出的要求最高委员会执行巩固国际和平政策的许许多多提案，说明了他们要求和平的愿望。
