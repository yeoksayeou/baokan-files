Xinhua News Agency, Hegang, 7th. The newly built and modernized Dongshan Shaft of Hegang Coal Mine has been basically completed. After trial production, the shaft's coal mining, transportation, hoisting, ventilation, and drainage equipment have proven to meet production requirements. The four coal mining areas, which began trial production on July 16th, have already produced tens of thousands of tons of high-quality industrial coal.

The Dongshan Shaft is one of the first completed of several large shafts built with Soviet assistance. The coalfield where the shaft is located has abundant reserves and unusually thick coal seams rare in the country. According to the Soviet design, this pair of shafts will have high output and efficiency, and will be able to extract all eight coal seams in the deep part of the coalfield.

Construction of the Dongshan Shaft began in 1950. During the construction process, the Soviet Union sent experts in mine construction and electromechanical installation to provide specific guidance for the project. The experts successively put forward thousands of valuable suggestions, overcame many technical difficulties in well construction, such as passing through broken stratum formations, and helped China train a well construction team of more than 4,000 people. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the construction workers worked diligently for five years, excavating more than 20 kilometers of transportation tunnels underground and completing a large number of construction and installation projects. More than 700 employees became advanced producers during the construction, including the Zhang Wenzhan concrete pump team, which created the "division of labor, professional assembly line operation method" and safely passed through broken stratum formations, and the Liu Jingchi advanced tunneling team, which tunneled 100 meters of roadway per month for three consecutive months. They powerfully guaranteed the completion of the shaft construction task.

    现代化的鹤岗煤矿东山竖井已基本建成
    新华社鹤岗七日电　鹤岗煤矿新建的现代化的东山竖井已基本建成。竖井的采煤、运输、提升、通风和排水等设备经过试生产证明，都符合于生产的要求。从七月十六日开始进入试生产的四个采煤区，现在已经采出了几万吨质量优良的工业用煤。
    东山竖井是苏联帮助我国建设的若干对大型竖井中，最先建成的一对。竖井所在的煤田，蕴藏量很丰富，而且有全国少有的厚煤层。根据苏联设计建成的这对竖井，产量大，效率高，能把煤田深部的八层煤都采掘出来。
    东山竖井是一九五零年开始建设的。在建设过程中，苏联派来了关于矿井建设和机电安装的专家，具体地指导工程的进行。专家们曾先后提出了上千条宝贵的建议，克服了穿过破碎带地层等许多建井技术上的困难，并帮助我国培养了一支四千多人的建井队伍。在苏联专家的指导下，建井职工经过了整整五年的辛勤劳动，在井下开凿出共长二十多公里的运输巷道，并完成了大量的建筑安装工程。有七百多个职工在建设中成为先进生产者，其中有创造“分工专业流水作业法”、安全穿过破碎带地层的张文占混凝土发?小组，有连续三个月每月掘进巷道一百公尺的刘景池先进掘进队等。他们有力地保证了竖井建设任务的完成。
