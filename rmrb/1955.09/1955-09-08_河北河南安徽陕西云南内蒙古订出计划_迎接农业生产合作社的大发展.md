Xinhua News Agency Report: Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Yunnan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have all formulated plans for the great development of agricultural production cooperatives in the future.

    Hebei Province has determined the overall plan for the development of the cooperative movement in the province. This winter and next spring, the province will develop 25,000 to 30,000 new cooperatives, which, together with the original 97,000 cooperatives, will reach 122,000 to 127,000; the number of households joining the cooperatives will reach about 50 percent of the total number of farming households. By the end of 1956, it is required that about 60 percent of farming households join the cooperatives. By the end of 1957, it is required that 70 to 75 percent be reached. By the end of 1958, the province will complete the semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, with more than 80 percent of farming households joining the cooperatives. This overall plan for the development of the cooperative movement was determined at the Fourth Party Congress of Hebei Province. When determining this plan, the meeting profoundly criticized the right-leaning sentiments shown by some cadres in the face of the high tide of the cooperative movement, and pointed out that the high tide of the cooperative movement in the rural areas of Hebei Province had already appeared last year, but some cadres mistakenly believed that the development of agricultural production cooperatives last winter and this spring was "too fast" and that it was necessary to "resolutely stop development," which damaged the socialist enthusiasm of some activists and poor peasants. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely oppose right-leaning sentiments and actively lead the cooperative movement forward.
    The plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives in Henan Province has been formulated by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China based on the current new situation in rural areas, and has been adopted at the recent expanded meeting of the Provincial Committee. This plan stipulates that from this winter to next autumn, the province will develop from the existing more than 40,000 cooperatives to 100,000, and the number of households joining the cooperatives will reach 30 percent of the total number of farming households; and make the greatest efforts to establish agricultural production cooperatives in the existing 20 percent of blank townships. The plan also stipulates that by 1957, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Henan Province should reach 180,000, and the number of households joining the cooperatives should reach about 60 percent of the total number of farming households. Now, all counties in Henan are successively holding party congresses or expanded cadre meetings to formulate plans for each county separately. A large number of backbones for running cooperatives have been trained in various places, and more than 43,800 mutual aid teams have been cultivated as targets for establishing cooperatives.
    The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has made a plan for the province to develop agricultural production cooperatives in the coming year. Before the spring plowing in 1956, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Anhui Province will increase from the current 46,900 to about 85,000. With the expansion of some old cooperatives, the number of households joining the cooperatives will account for about 34 percent of the total number of farming households in the province. Now, more than 32,000 old cooperatives in the province that are preparing to expand have begun various expansion activities in conjunction with autumn harvest and profit distribution. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and local committees and county committees have begun to train nearly 300,000 backbones and activists for running cooperatives in rural areas.
    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to develop from the current 17,000 agricultural production cooperatives to 35,000 cooperatives by the autumn of 1956, with the number of households joining the cooperatives reaching 30 percent of the total number of rural households in the province; to 65,000 cooperatives in 1957, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for 55 percent of the total number of rural households in the province; and to 90,000 cooperatives in 1958, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for 75 percent of the total number of rural households in the province. In 1959, the main task of the province is to expand the cooperatives, requiring the number of households joining the cooperatives to account for 85 percent of the total number of rural households in the province.
    The high tide of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural Yunnan Province has arrived. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at its expanded meeting held in late August, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, comprehensively studied the overall plan for the cooperative movement in the areas of Yunnan Province that have completed land reform. The meeting decided to revise the original plan to develop 17,000 cooperatives in the province this autumn to 30,000 cooperatives, and to develop to 60,000 cooperatives by next winter, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for 40 percent of the total number of farming households. According to this plan, by the time the first five-year plan is completed in 1957, Yunnan Province will have more than 73,000 agricultural production cooperatives, and the number of households joining the cooperatives will account for more than 50 percent of the total number of farming households. The autumn cooperative establishment work has already begun, and nearly 200,000 trained rural activists have launched cooperative establishment activities.
    The mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is facing a great development situation. Before the spring plowing in 1956, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region will increase from the current 6,994 to about 11,000, and the proportion of households joining the cooperatives to the total number of farming households will increase from the current 17.7 percent to about 30 percent; by 1957, the number of farming households joining the cooperatives will account for about 50 percent of the total number of farming households. This plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives was decided at the mutual aid and cooperation conference held by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China in August. The meeting also pointed out that in developing agricultural production cooperatives in areas where ethnic groups live together, special attention should be paid to implementing the party's ethnic policies, strengthening education on ethnic unity and equality for farmers of all ethnic groups, and paying attention to issues such as ethnic characteristics, living habits, production specialties, and religious beliefs.

    河北河南安徽陕西云南内蒙古订出计划
    迎接农业生产合作社的大发展
    据新华社讯　河北、河南、安徽、陕西、云南、内蒙古自治区等地都制定了今后农业生产合作社大发展的计划。
    河北省已确定全省合作化运动发展的总规划。今冬明春全省将发展新社二万五千到三万个，连原有九万七千多社达到十二万二千到十二万七千个；入社农户达到总农户数的百分之五十左右。一九五六年底入社农户要求达到百分之六十左右。一九五七年底要求达到百分之七十到七十五。一九五八年底全省完成半社会主义的农业合作化事业，入社农户达到百分之八十以上。这个合作化运动发展的总规划，是在河北省第四次党代表会议上确定的。会议在确定这个规划时，深刻地批判了部分干部在合作化运动高潮面前所表现的右倾情绪，并指出河北省农村中合作化运动的高潮去年就已出现，部分干部却错误地认为去冬今春农业生产合作社的发展“太快”，要“坚决停止发展”，以致损伤了部分积极分子和贫农的社会主义热情。因此，必须坚决反对右倾情绪，积极领导合作化运动前进。
    河南省发展农业生产合作社的计划已由中共河南省委员会根据当前农村新形势于最近订出，并已在最近召开的省委员会扩大会议上通过。这个计划规定：从今冬到明年秋前止，全省将由现有的四万多个社发展到十万个，入社农户达到总农户的百分之三十；并以最大的努力在现有的百分之二十的空白乡建立农业生产合作社。计划又规定到一九五七年止，河南全省农业生产合作社要达到十八万个，入社农户达到总农户的百分之六十左右。现在，河南各县正相继召开党代表会或扩大干部会议，分别制定各县的计划。各地并已训练了大批的办社骨干，在原有互助组中培养了四万三千八百多个作为建社对象。
    中共安徽省委已作出了今后一年全省发展农业生产合作社的计划。到一九五六年春耕以前，安徽省的农业生产合作社将由现在的四万六千九百多个发展到八万五千个左右，加上部分老社的扩大，那时入社农户将占全省农户总数的百分之三十四左右。现在全省准备扩大的三万二千多个老社，已结合秋收、分红开始了各种扩社活动。中共安徽省委和各地委、县委，已开始在农村中训练近三十万名办社骨干和积极分子。
    中共陕西省委计划在现有一万七千个农业生产合作社的基础上，到一九五六年秋发展到三万五千个社，入社农户达到占全省农村总户数的百分之三十；一九五七年发展到六万五千个社，入社农户占全省农村总户数的百分之五十五；一九五八年发展到九万个社，入社农户占全省农村总户数的百分之七十五。一九五九年全省主要任务是扩社，要求入社农户占全省农村总户数的百分之八十五。
    云南省农村互助合作运动的高潮已经到来。中共云南省委员会在八月下旬举行的扩大会议，根据中共中央的指示，全盘地研究了云南省在已完成土地改革地区的合作化运动的总规划，会议决定把原订今年秋季在全省发展一万七千个社的计划，改订为发展到三万个社，到明年冬季发展到六万个社，入社农户占总农户的百分之四十。按照这个规划，到一九五七年第一个五年计划完成时，云南省农业生产合作社将达到七万三千多个，入社农户将占总农户的百分之五十以上。现在秋季建社工作已经开始，近二十万名经过训练的农村积极分子已展开建社活动。
    内蒙古自治区互助合作运动已面临一个大发展的形势。到一九五六年春耕前，全区的农业生产合作社将由目前的六千九百九十四个发展到一万一千个左右，入社农户占农户总数的比例将由目前的百分之十七点七提高到百分之三十左右；到一九五七年，入社的农户将占农户总数百分之五十左右。这个发展农业生产合作社的计划，是在中共内蒙古自治区委员会在八月份召开的互助合作会议上决定的。会议并指出：在民族杂居地区发展农业生产合作社，要特别注意贯彻党的民族政策，对各族农民加强民族团结、平等的教育，注意民族特点、生活习惯、生产特长和宗教信仰等方面的问题。
