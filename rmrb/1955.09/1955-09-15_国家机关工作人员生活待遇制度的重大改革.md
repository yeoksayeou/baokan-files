　　A Major Reform of the Living Standards System for State Organ Staff

　　To unify and improve the living standards system for state organ staff, the State Council issued the "Order on Fully Implementing the Wage System and Changing to Monetary Wages for State Organ Staff" on August 31, 1955, and promulgated the "Wage Standard Table for State Organ Staff," "National Price Subsidy Table," and "Decision on Implementing In-Kind Supply for Staff in Certain Special Areas." At the same time, it also issued interim measures for central state organ staff regarding renting public housing, using public furniture, water and electricity, and charging for sending children to nurseries, and instructed the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality to refer to these measures and formulate rental and fee collection methods based on local conditions, and to issue and implement them within their respective jurisdictions. This is a major reform of our state organ staff's living standards system and a major event in our national life. This measure is of great significance for promoting our socialist construction cause. The principle of distribution in socialist society is "to each according to his work." The better one works, the more one earns; equal work earns equal pay. Only in this way can people be urged to care about the results of their labor from a material point of view and correctly combine their personal interests with the overall interests of the country. Only in this way can there be constantly increasing labor productivity and work efficiency, promoting the rapid development of various construction undertakings. Therefore, "to each according to his work" and "equal pay for equal work" are the basic principles for our state organs to formulate wage systems and handle wage issues. The orders issued by the State Council and the various related systems formulated are implementing this principle.

　　It should be explained that in the long revolutionary war in the past, staff uniformly implemented the supply system. From leaders at all levels to ordinary staff, they lived an almost identical or very slightly different military communist style of life. This system was adapted to the extremely difficult war environment and extremely difficult material conditions at that time, and played a huge role in overcoming financial difficulties and ensuring the victory of the war, which must be affirmed. However, with the victory of the revolutionary war and the recovery and development of the national economy, this system has completed its historical mission and needs to be replaced by a new system. As early as the early days of the founding of our country, due to the maintenance of the original wage treatment for a large number of retained personnel, or the implementation of the wage system for some newly employed personnel, there was already a situation in which the supply system and the wage system coexisted. In 1952, in order to appropriately improve the living standards of staff receiving supply system treatment, it was decided to issue them a certain amount of subsidies. From the point of view of giving different amounts of subsidies according to different positions, it was already more advanced than before. However, the amount of these subsidies was not large. Generally speaking, their income was still much less than that of staff receiving wage system treatment. In the past few years, with the recovery and development of the national economy, the wages of state organ staff have increased, and the number of people enjoying wage system treatment has also continued to increase. Now, among all state organ staff, those enjoying supply system treatment are already in the minority, accounting for about one-third. The vast majority of them are mainly the vast number of county and district-level cadres, who are either married and their wives do not work, or they are not yet married and have no children. Many supply system benefits cannot be enjoyed, and their actual income is much less than that of wage system personnel at the same level. Only a few people with many children have higher actual incomes than wage system personnel at the same level because they receive more childcare and nanny fees. In addition, due to the influence of the supply system, some staff enjoying wage system treatment receive wages according to the national wage standards and also enjoy some supply system benefits, which also creates some unreasonable phenomena. Furthermore, because the wage standards in the past were inconsistent in various regions, the wage standards in enterprises and institutions were inconsistent with those in administrative organs, and after cadres were transferred to work, some people enjoyed "retained wage" treatment, that is, their wages were higher than those of their colleagues at the same level in the same agency, which was also abnormal. The above phenomena all violate the principles of "to each according to his work" and "equal pay for equal work," and more or less have some negative impact on staff. The state leadership took these situations into consideration, considered the state's financial situation, and made full preparations before deciding to fully implement the wage system from July of this year, ending the coexistence of the wage system and the supply system, and decided to implement a unified wage standard in state organs, which is completely correct and timely.

　　Simultaneous with the major measure of fully implementing the wage system, it is also necessary to abolish the wage point calculation method and change to the monetary wage system. The wage point calculation method was a method stipulated by the state in the early days of liberation in order to prevent the income of staff from being affected by price fluctuations. This method played a great role in ensuring the lives of staff. However, in the past few years, national prices have been stable for a long time; due to the gradual improvement of the living standards of state organ staff, the five kinds of physical goods included in the wage point calculation, namely grain, cloth, oil, salt, and coal, can no longer include all or most of the living needs; even, some places have produced some unreasonable phenomena of high calculated scores due to improper selection of physical goods or wage zone divisions that do not meet the actual situation. These all show that it is no longer appropriate to continue to use the wage point calculation method in the future. Therefore, the State Council ordered that the wage point calculation method be abolished and changed to the monetary wage system, and promulgated a unified monetary wage standard and price subsidy table. Why is there still a price subsidy? This is because our country is vast, transportation is inconvenient, and economic development is unbalanced. Many regions actually have price differences. The price subsidy is a simple and easy way to compensate for price differences in various regions. With price subsidies, staff in various regions can enjoy roughly the same living standards, which truly embodies the unity of national wage standards. Of course, the price subsidy ratio in various regions cannot be fixed and unchangeable, and the current regulations on the price subsidy ratio in various regions are not complete and accurate. In the future, with the development of the national economy, the improvement of transportation conditions, and changes in price differences in various regions, the price subsidy ratio in various regions must be adjusted in a timely manner. In addition, in order to ensure the living needs of staff in certain special areas with inconvenient transportation and lack of materials, it was also decided to implement in-kind supply for staff in these areas starting from October of this year. These measures are concrete manifestations of the state's concern for the lives of staff.

　　After the full implementation of the wage system, personal living expenses, children's education expenses, and other family expenses should of course be paid by personal wage income. Therefore, the State Council ordered that in the future, staff must pay rent and fees for living in public housing, using public furniture, using water and electricity, and sending children to nurseries, and issued interim measures for rent and fee collection in central agencies, requiring all regions to follow suit. These interim measures have been formulated after repeated research and are practical and feasible at present; of course, these are only preliminary measures, and they need to be continuously revised in practice in the future to make them more complete and reasonable. The implementation of these measures can not only save the state's administrative expenses, but more importantly, it can urge the improvement of the living management work of agencies and overcome some bad ideological tendencies existing among some staff. Under the influence of the long-term implementation of the supply system in the past, some people only cared about state affairs and did not care about family affairs, relying on the public to take care of almost all personal affairs, and completely gave up the responsibility of managing housework. Some people, in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, only cared about their own convenience and did not ask about the state's burden. Some agency living management units, in the case of relying entirely on state funding, always reached out to financial agencies for money, always wanting more and more, which led to extravagant and wasteful phenomena. We have done a lot of ideological education work on these bad ideological tendencies, but it is not enough to only conduct ideological education. Now, we must implement a reasonable system, stipulate correct practices, and restrict incorrect practices, so that everyone can do things well. The living management units of each agency should conscientiously implement various systems, listen to everyone's opinions, and pay attention to organizing everyone's strength, carefully calculate, improve business management methods, and do a good job in serving all staff of the agency. All state organ staff should pay attention to cultivating the virtues of distinguishing between public and private, being diligent and thrifty, cherishing public property, and improving the level of socialist consciousness.

　　After the full implementation of the wage system and the implementation of the measures for state organ staff to pay rent and fees for living in public housing, using public furniture, using water and electricity, and sending children to nurseries, will the lives of state organ staff be affected? We say that the lives of the vast majority of staff will not be affected. Because the monetary wage standard and price subsidy table formulated this time are based on the calculation of the current wage point value in various places, with slight adjustments, and the wage growth factors stipulated in the national plan for this year are also included, and everyone's income has generally increased; at the same time, the various rent and fee collection standards stipulated by the central agency this time are relatively low, which ensures that the lives of staff will not be affected. However, since this reform has changed some unreasonable factors in the original system, there will always be some people whose income will be affected to some extent. This is mainly because some staff with many children who originally received supply system treatment, and some staff with "retained wage" treatment who received wage system treatment, their income has decreased somewhat, and this decrease is a reasonable decrease. In order to implement the national wage policy and maintain the unity of the national wage system, everyone should act in accordance with the national system, and it is not right to maintain exceptions. At the same time, among these people whose income has decreased, those with a higher wage amount and a lighter family burden will not have difficulties in life, only those with a lower wage amount and a heavier family burden will have some difficulties. These difficulties can also be subsidized from the agency's welfare funds if individuals are unable to fully resolve them, so there are ways to solve these difficulties.

　　What kind of standard is the current wage standard for our state organ staff? It should be said that it is still a relatively low wage standard. But it must also be said that in terms of our country's level of production development and the current living standards of the people, it is not very low. As long as everyone can live within their means, carefully calculate, plan expenses, carry forward the style of diligence and thrift, learn to manage housework, and always be vigilant against being eroded by the corrupt and hedonistic thinking of the bourgeoisie, then it can be guaranteed that all our state staff can live well and work well. Of course, in the future, with the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives, the wages of our state organ staff will also increase accordingly. The purpose of our developing production and building socialism is to continuously improve the people's living standards, including continuously improving the living standards of state organ staff. The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China clearly stipulates: "Within five years, the average wages of workers and staff in state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, state organs, people's organizations, and cultural, educational, and health departments will increase by about 33 percent." This is proof. However, the increase in the wages of state organ staff must be gradually increased on the basis of the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives. We must have a clear understanding of this. We believe that after this reform, the living standards system of our state organs will be more reasonable than in the past, and will certainly be able to better enhance the revolutionary enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of staff, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of work, and improve the work efficiency of state organs, and strive to complete the great task of the first five-year plan.

### 国家机关工作人员生活待遇制度的重大改革

    国家机关工作人员生活待遇制度的重大改革
    为了统一和改进国家机关工作人员的生活待遇制度，国务院于一九五五年八月三十一日发布了“关于国家机关工作人员全部实行工资制和改行货币工资制的命令”，并颁发了“国家机关工作人员工资标准表”，“全国各地物价津贴表”和“关于某些特殊地区工作人员实行实物供应的决定”。同时，还颁发了中央国家机关工作人员居住公家房屋、使用公家家具、用水用电和送子女入托儿所收租收费等暂行办法，并责成各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会参照这些办法，结合当地具体情况，分别制定各项收租收费办法，在各该辖区发布施行。这是我们国家机关工作人员生活待遇制度的重大改革，是我们国家生活中的一件大事。这项措施，对于推进我们建设社会主义的事业有重大的意义。社会主义社会的分配原则，是“按劳取酬”。谁劳动愈好，工作得愈好，谁获得的报酬就愈多，同等的工作就能获得同等的报酬。这样，才能够督促人们从物质利益上关心自己的劳动成果，并将个人的利益和国家的整体利益正确地结合起来。这样，才能有不断增长的劳动生产率和工作效率，推动各项建设事业突飞猛进地向前发展。因此，“按劳取酬”和“同工同酬”，是我们国家机关制定工资制度和处理工资问题的基本原则。国务院颁布的命令和制定的各项有关的制度，就是贯彻着这个原则的。
    应当说明，在过去长期的革命战争中，工作人员一律实行供给制待遇，从各级领导干部到普通工作人员，都过着几乎一样或者差别极小的军事共产主义式的生活，这种制度是和当时十分艰苦的战争环境、极端困难的物质条件相适应的，对克服财政困难、保障战争胜利起了巨大的作用，这是必须加以肯定的。但是，随着革命战争的胜利，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，这种制度已经完成了它的历史使命，而需要用新的制度来代替它了。早在我国建国初期，由于对大量的留用人员维持着原来的工资待遇，或对一部分新参加工作的人员实行工资制待遇，那时就已经出现了供给制和工资制两种制度并存的局面。一九五二年，为了适当提高受供给制待遇的工作人员的生活水平，决定发给他们一定数量的津贴，从按照不同职务给予不同数量的津贴这一点看，是已经较前进步了，但是，这种津贴的数目是不大的，一般说来，他们的收入仍然比受工资制待遇人员的收入少得多。这几年来，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，国家机关工作人员的工资增长了，享受工资制待遇的人员也不断增多。现在全部国家机关工作人员中，享受供给制待遇的已经是少数，大约占三分之一左右。其中绝大多数人，主要是广大的县、区级干部，他们或者已结婚而女方没有参加工作，或者是还没有结婚，没有子女，许多供给制的待遇享受不到，实际收入就比同级工资制人员的收入要少得多。只有少数多子女的人是因领取保育费、保姆费较多，其实际收入较同级工资制人员为多。还有，由于供给制的影响，一部分享受工资制待遇的工作人员，既按照国家规定的工资标准领取了工资，又享受着一些供给制待遇，也造成一些不合理现象。此外，由于过去各地区工资标准不一致，企业、事业系统与行政机关的工资标准不一致，干部经过调动工作后，有些人享受着“保留工资”的待遇，即在同一机关中，他们的工资较其同级人员为高，这也是不正常的。以上种种现象，都是违反“按劳取酬”和“同工同酬”的原则的，都或多或少地在工作人员中产生一些消极的影响。国家领导机关考虑了这种种情况，考虑了国家的财政状况，并作了充分准备之后，决定从今年七月份起，全部实行工资制，结束工资制和供给制并存的局面，并决定在国家机关中实行统一的工资标准，这是完全正确的和切合时宜的。
    与全部实行工资制这一重大措施的同时，废止工资分计算方法改行货币工资制，也是必要的。工资分的计算方法，是全国解放初期国家为了不使工作人员的收入受到物价波动的影响而规定的办法，这种办法对保障工作人员的生活起了很大作用。但是，过去几年来，全国物价有了长期的稳定；由于国家机关工作人员生活水平的逐步提高，工资分所含粮、布、油、盐、煤五种实物已不能包括全部或大部生活需要；甚至，有些地方由于实物品种选用不当或工资分区划分不切合实际，因而产生一些计算分值偏高的不合理现象。这些，都说明今后继续采用工资分计算方法已经不适宜了。因此，国务院命令规定，废止工资分计算方法改行货币工资制，颁发了统一的货币工资标准和物价津贴表。为什么还要有物价津贴呢？这是因为，我国幅员广大，交通不便，经济发展不平衡，很多地区实际上存在着物价差额，物价津贴就是弥补各地区物价差额的一种简便易行的办法。有了物价津贴，就可以使各地区的工作人员享有大致相同的生活水平，也就真正地体现了全国工资标准的统一。当然，各地区物价津贴的比率不能是固定不变的，而且这次对于各地区物价津贴比率的规定也不是完备的和十分准确的，今后随着全国经济的发展、交通条件的改善、各地区物价差额的变化，必须对各地区物价津贴比率作出适时调整。此外，为了保证某些交通不便、物资缺乏的特殊地区工作人员的生活需要，还决定从今年十月开始，要对这些地区的工作人员实行实物供应。这些措施，都是国家关怀工作人员的生活的具体表现。
    在全部实行工资制之后，个人的生活消费、子女教养的费用和家庭的其他费用，当然都应由个人工资收入去支付。因此，国务院命令规定，今后工作人员住用公家房屋、使用公家家具、用水用电、子女送托儿所等，均须缴租、纳费，并颁发了中央机关的各项收租、收费的暂行办法，要各地区仿照办理。这些暂行办法，都是经过反复研究制定出来的，在目前是切实可行的；当然这只是初步办法，今后还需要在实行中不断修正，使它更加完备，更加合理。实行这些办法，不仅是可以节约国家的行政经费开支，更重要的，是可以督促改善机关的生活管理工作，克服一部分工作人员中存在的一些不良思想倾向。在过去长期实行供给制的影响下，有些人是只管国事，不管家事，几乎一切个人事务都依靠公家照料，自己完全放弃了料理家务的责任。有些人，在衣食住行方面，只管自己方便，不问国家负担。有些机关的生活管理单位，在一切靠国家出钱办事的情况下，总是伸手向财政机关要钱，总是要的越多越好，这样就产生大手大脚，铺张浪费的现象。对于这些不良思想倾向，我们曾经做过很多思想教育工作，但仅仅进行思想教育究竟还是不够的，现在要实行一套合理的制度，规定正确的做法，限制不正确的做法，大家就都好办事了。各个机关的生活管理单位，应当认真地执行各项制度，倾听大家的意见，并注意组织大家的力量，精打细算，改善经营管理方法，把为机关全体工作人员服务的事情办好。全体国家机关工作人员，都要注意养成公私分明、勤俭朴素、爱护公共财产的美德，提高社会主义的觉悟水平。
    在全部实行工资制和实行国家机关工作人员居住公家房屋、使用公家家具、用水用电、送子女入托儿所收租收费办法之后，国家机关工作人员的生活是否会受到影响呢？我们说，绝大多数工作人员的生活不会受到影响。因为，这次制定的货币工资标准和物价津贴表，是根据各地现行工资分值的计算，稍加调整，又将本年度国家计划规定的工资增长因素也计算在内的，大家的收入一般地都增多了；同时，这次规定的中央机关的各项收租收费标准都是比较低的，这就保证了工作人员的生活不会受到影响。但是，这次改革，既然是改掉了原有制度中的一些不合理因素，那就总会有一些人员的收入受到一些影响，这主要是，原受供给制待遇中的一些多子女的人员，和受工资制待遇中的一些享有“保留工资”待遇的人员，他们的收入是减少了一些，这种减少是合理的减少。为了贯彻国家的工资政策，维护国家工资制度的统一，任何人都应按国家的制度办事，保持特殊是不对的。同时，这一些收入减少的人员中，工资数量较多而家庭负担较轻的人，生活上并不会发生困难，只是那些工资数量较少而家庭负担较重的人，才会发生一些困难。这些困难，在个人无力完全解决的情况下，还可以由机关福利费中给予补助，所以，这些困难是有办法解决的。
    现在我们国家机关工作人员的工资标准是一个什么样的标准呢？应当说，还是一个比较低的工资标准。但也必须说，就我们国家的生产发展水平来说，比较当前人民群众的生活水平来说，已经不是很低了。只要大家都能够量入为出，精打细算，计划开支，发扬勤俭朴素的作风，学会料理家务，时常警惕不要受到资产阶级腐化享乐思想侵蚀的影响，那就可以有保证地说，我们全体国家工作人员，都可以生活得好，工作得好。当然，今后随着国民经济的发展，随着人民生活的改善，我们国家机关工作人员的工资也会有相应的增长。我们发展生产的目的，建设社会主义的目的，就是为了不断提高人民的生活水平，包括不断提高国家机关工作人员的生活水平在内。中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中明确规定：“五年内，国营企业、合作社营企业、公私合营企业、国家机关、人民团体和文化教育卫生部门的工人职员的平均工资约增长百分之三十三。”这就是明证。但是，国家机关工作人员工资的增长，必须是在国民经济的发展、人民生活的改善的基础上，逐步地增长。这一点，我们必须有明确的认识。我们相信，经过这次改革，我们国家机关的生活待遇制度，较之过去是更加合理了，一定能够更好地增强工作人员的革命热忱和责任心，发挥工作的积极性、创造性，提高国家机关的工作效率，为完成第一个五年计划的伟大任务而奋斗。
