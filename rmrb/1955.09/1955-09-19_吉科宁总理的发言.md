    Xinhua News Agency, via TASS:
    Prime Minister Kekkonen's Speech
    Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers! Gentlemen!
    We have carefully listened to the speech of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and gladly agree with the views you expressed in your speech. Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, your opinion that the treaty of 1948 has a particularly significant meaning is in line with our view of the significance of this treaty. It is this treaty and its spirit that lay the foundation for Finland's policy and Finnish-Soviet relations. We recognize that the active economic relations expressed in the five-year agreement are mainly based on the 1948 treaty. Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, I also agree with your views on developing this trade between the two countries. Since the 1948 treaty is about to expire and the Soviet side has proposed extending this treaty, we on this side accept this proposal and are prepared to do so.
    Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the remarks you made about the Porkkala-Udd naval base filled our hearts, and the hearts of all Finnish people, with joy. It is impossible to cite more evidence of the good neighborly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union than the coexistence between the two countries, which can serve as an example and has made it possible for the Soviet Union to relinquish its right to lease the Porkkala-Udd naval base before its expiration.
    Therefore, I can only say that we accept the two proposals you, Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, have put forward. I would like to suggest, as a practical measure, that we set up a small – let us say – mixed commission to thoroughly study the specific issues of implementing these measures.

    吉科宁总理的发言部长会议主席先生！先生们！
    我们仔细地倾听了部长会议主席的发言，并且欣然同意你在发言中所表示的意见。部长会议主席先生，你认为一九四八年的条约具有特别重大的意义的意见，同我们对这项条约的意义的看法是相符合的。正是这项条约和它的精神奠定了芬兰的政策和芬苏关系的基础。我们认识到表现在五年协定中的活跃的经济关系主要就是以一九四八年的条约为根据的。部长会议主席先生，我也同意你关于发展两国之间的这种贸易的意见。由于一九四八年的条约不久就要满期，而苏联方面建议延长这一条约，因此我们这方面接受这项建议，并且准备这样做。
    部长会议主席先生，你所发表的关于波卡拉乌德海军基地的谈话使得我们的心中，也使全体芬兰人民的心中充满喜悦。不可能举出比芬苏之间的共处关系更加能够说明两个国家之间的善邻关系的证据，这种关系可以作为一个榜样，并且已使得苏联认为有可能在期满以前放弃它租借波卡拉乌德海军基地的权利。
    因此，我只能说我们接受你，部长会议主席先生所提出的两项建议。我愿意建议，作为一种切实可行的措施，我们设立一个小的——让我们这样说——混合委员会，以便周密地研究执行这些措施的具体问题。　（新华社据塔斯社讯）
