Guangdong Province Achieves Bumper Harvest of Jute in Various Regions

    The jute harvest in Guangdong Province has been completed. Preliminary estimates indicate that the total output has increased by 24% compared to 1954, exceeding the highest level before liberation by more than twofold. Farmers are now actively selling their jute to the state.

    Guangdong Province has high temperatures and abundant rainfall, making it very promising for developing jute production. Although there was a spring drought this year, due to farmers' active drought resistance efforts and improved production techniques, the yield per unit area of jute in many regions is still quite high. In Wuchuan County, the average yield of over 40,000 mu of jute was 360 jin per mu. The Shazhou Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in this county harvested 2,851 jin from 2.1 mu of jute. In the Pearl River Delta, the main jute producing area, the general yield per mu reached 500 to 600 jin. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东省各地黄麻获得丰收
    广东省黄麻收获完毕，初步估计总产量比一九五四年增加百分之二十四，超过解放前最高水平两倍以上。现在农民正纷纷把黄麻卖给国家。
    广东省高温多雨，发展黄麻生产很有前途。今年虽然遇到春旱，由于农民积极抗旱和改进生产技术，许多地区黄麻的单位面积产量仍相当高。吴川县四万多亩黄麻，平均每亩产三百六十斤。这个县的沙洲乡农业生产合作社，有二点一亩黄麻收了二千八百五十一斤。珠江三角洲的主要黄麻产区，一般每亩产量达到五、六百斤。　（新华社）
