Introduction to the Union of Burma

    Burma is our country's southwestern neighbor, located in the northwestern part of the Indochina Peninsula. It borders India and Pakistan to the west, Laos to the east, and Thailand to the southeast. Burma faces the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea to the south and southwest.

    Burma is a multi-ethnic country. Of its approximately 20 million people, Burmese people make up about two-thirds; the next largest groups are the Karen, Shan, Mon, Chin, and Kachin peoples, and other ethnic groups. About 500,000 Indians and Pakistanis, 300,000 Chinese, and several thousand Europeans live in Burma. Burmese is the national language.

    The capital of Burma is Rangoon, with a population of over 700,000. Mandalay, Moulmein, Bassein, and Henzada are Burma's largest economic and cultural centers.

    As a result of the Burmese people's national liberation struggle, the six-starred national flag was raised in Rangoon on January 4, 1948, and Burma declared its independence. The Union of Burma is a republic composed of Burma proper, the Shan State, the Kachin State, the Karen State, and the Chin Special Division.

    According to the Constitution of the Union of Burma, legislative power belongs to the Parliament, which consists of two houses: the House of Representatives and the House of Nationalities. The House of Representatives has 250 members, while the House of Nationalities has 125 members. Members of the House of Representatives are elected by Burmese citizens who are eighteen years of age or older and have not lost their right to vote. Citizens who are twenty-one years of age or older have the right to be elected to Parliament. Parliament is elected every four years.

    The head of the Union is the President, who is elected by a joint session of both houses of Parliament for a term of five years. The current President of the Union of Burma is Ba U.

    The President appoints the Prime Minister and, on the nomination of the Prime Minister, appoints the members of the government's cabinet. Executive power belongs to the Cabinet. Since the establishment of the national government, the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma has been U Nu.

    Burma's natural resources are rich and abundant. Its subsoil contains large deposits of tungsten, lead, tin, silver, nickel, cobalt, gold, and manganese. In the Tavoy district of southeastern Burma, rich iron ore layers are scattered. Burma has considerable brown coal deposits, and oil is extracted along the middle reaches of the Irrawaddy River. Before World War II, Burma mined and exported the second largest amount of tungsten concentrate in the world, accounting for 20 percent of the world's total tungsten mining. The northern, northwestern, and eastern regions of Burma have vast hydropower reserves.

    Burma is one of the largest rice-producing areas in Southeast Asia. Before World War II, it was the largest rice exporter in Southeast Asia, accounting for 37 percent of the world's refined rice exports.

    Not long ago, all of Burma's wealth was exploited not by the Burmese people themselves, but by foreign monopoly capital. These foreign monopoly capital controlled all the mining industry, oil fields, a large number of sawmills and mechanized rice mills, transportation, foreign trade, and a considerable portion of domestic trade and the nation's finances. The colonial system and the rule of foreign monopoly capital hindered the development of Burma's national economy.

    In the seven and a half years since independence, Burma has implemented many measures to strengthen its economic independence and weaken the position of foreign capital. The strengthening of the state capitalist component is achieved through the nationalization of certain foreign capital. At the same time, it is stipulated that compensation should be paid to them.

    From 1948 to 1954, many British companies were nationalized. The government purchased many enterprises belonging to foreign monopoly capital. Several Anglo-Burmese joint ventures were established on the basis of the former British companies, such as the "New Burma Oil Company of 1954". In this company, the Union of Burma has one-third of the shares, while British oil monopoly capital owns two-thirds. In 1951, the government bought half of the shares from the British "Burma Corporation".

    However, the establishment of joint ventures rarely promotes the development of the Burmese economy, because foreign capital still occupies a dominant position in these companies. Therefore, in recent years, Burma has increasingly adopted the policy of establishing national industries, which is also natural.

    From 1953 to 1954, Burma's general production level reached 80.4 percent of the pre-war level, exceeding the 1946-1947 level by 19.2 percent. According to official 1954 industrial survey materials, Burma has a total of 1,982 enterprises, employing over 90,000 people.

    Railway transportation, postal and telecommunications, foreign trade, and the financial system are all in the hands of the state. This has greatly promoted Burma's economic development. In recent years, Burma's foreign trade links have expanded. The Union of Burma conducts trade with all Southeast Asian countries, many Western capitalist countries, as well as our country, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Yugoslavia, and other countries. Burma imports equipment necessary for the development of national industries and exports mainly agricultural products and industrial raw materials.

    Burma is an agricultural country. Seventy percent of the national population is engaged in agriculture. Most of them are peasant private owners, tenant farmers, and agricultural workers. In colonial Burma, the agricultural economy was also subordinate to the interests of foreign monopoly capital. Before the war, agricultural products accounted for 95 percent of Burma's total exports.

    In the past seven and a half years, independent Burma has made remarkable achievements in developing agriculture. The sown area is expanding, and the number of livestock is also increasing. The total harvest of rice in 1952 to 1953 was 5.74 million tons, which is 1.772 million tons more than the output in 1946 to 1947. Burma's sesame, tobacco, millet, and wheat production has exceeded pre-war levels.

    However, the development of the agricultural economy of the Union of Burma is still greatly constrained by the existing remnants of feudalism in the countryside. In 1948, the government passed a law on the nationalization of land, which stipulated that landlords should be compensated and that land redeemed in this way should be redistributed to farmers. All landlord-owned land exceeding 50 acres must be nationalized. The implementation period of this law is expected to be ten years. It is expected that after the full implementation of this law, farmers will obtain 10 million acres of land. However, this measure of the government has been severely resisted by the landlords.

    The government of the Union of Burma pursues a foreign policy of peace, which is based on the principles of friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence with other countries. The Prime Ministers of China and Burma have issued a joint statement confirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The mutual relations between Burma and our country, India, and most countries in Asia and Africa are built on these principles.

    As everyone knows, along with India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon, the Burmese government was also one of the most active initiators of the Bandung Conference, which made a great contribution to easing tensions in the Asian-African region.

    The Burmese people and government are actively fighting to consolidate international peace. Burma has advocated the cessation of military operations in Vietnam and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and has consistently supported the demand for the restoration of our country's legitimate status in the United Nations. The Burmese people, along with all other peace-loving people in the world, demand a ban on weapons of mass destruction. The Burmese people and government are playing an important role in the cause of safeguarding world peace.

    缅甸联邦介绍
    缅甸是我国的西南邻邦，它位于印度支那半岛的西北部。它的西面同印度和巴基斯坦接壤，东面同老挝接壤，东南面同泰国接壤。缅甸的南面和西南面濒临孟加拉湾和安达曼海。
    缅甸是一个多民族的国家。在约两千万人口中，缅甸人约有三分之二；按人数计次于他们的是：克伦族、掸族、汶族、钦族、克钦族和其他民族。在缅甸居住着约五十万印度人和巴基斯坦人，三十万中国人和几千欧洲人。缅甸语是全国的语言。
    缅甸的首都是仰光，有居民七十万人以上。曼德勒、毛淡棉、勃生、兴实达等城是缅甸的最大的经济和文化中心。
    缅甸人民民族解放斗争的结果，一九四八年一月四日在仰光升起了六星的国旗，缅甸宣布独立。缅甸联邦是由缅甸本部、掸邦、克钦邦、克伦邦和钦族特别区组成的共和国。
    根据缅甸联邦宪法，立法权属于由两院——代表院和民族院——组成的国会。代表院有议员二百五十名，而民族院则有议员一百二十五名。代表院的议员由年满十八岁未丧失选举权的缅甸公民选举。年满二十一岁的公民有被选入国会的权利。国会每四年选举一次。
    联邦的元首是总统，总统由国会两院联席会议选出，任期为五年。现在缅甸联邦的总统是巴宇。
    总统委任总理，并根据总理的提名委任政府的阁员。行政权属于内阁。从建立民族政府之日起，缅甸联邦的总理就是吴努。
              ×　×　×
    缅甸的自然资源是富饶和丰盛的。在它的地下藏有钨、铅、锡、银、镍和钴、金、锰的大量矿藏。在缅甸东南部的塔瓦区，散布着丰富的铁矿层。缅甸拥有相当大量的褐煤层，沿伊洛瓦底江中流开采着石油。在第二次世界大战前，缅甸开采和出口的钨精矿占世界第二位，为全世界钨的开采量的百分之二十。缅甸的北部、西北和东部各区拥有大量的水力发电的储藏能力。
    缅甸是东南亚最大的一个产米区。第二次世界大战前，它的大米出口量在东南亚是第一位，占世界精米出口量的百分之三十七。
    不久以前，缅甸的所有财富还不是由缅甸人自己、而是由外国垄断资本所利用。这些外国垄断资本把持了所有的采矿工业、油田、大量的锯木工厂和机械化辗米工厂、运输业、对外贸易和相当大部分的国内贸易以及国家的财政。殖民制度和外国垄断资本的统治阻碍了缅甸民族经济的发展。
    独立以来的七年半期间，缅甸曾实行了许多加强自己的经济独立、削弱外国资本地位的措施。国家资本主义成分的加强是通过把某些外国资本收归国有的方法来实现的。同时规定了要给它们支付赔偿费。
    从一九四八年到一九五四年，许多英国公司被收归国有。政府购买了许多属于外国垄断资本的企业。以旧日的英国公司为基础，成立了几个英缅合营公司，例如“一九五四年新缅甸石油公司”便是这样的。在这个公司里缅甸联邦有三分之一的股份，而英国石油垄断资本则拥有三分之二的股份。一九五一年政府从英国的“缅甸企业公司”收买了一半的股份。
    但是，合营公司的建立很少能促进缅甸经济的发展，因为在这些公司里外国资本仍然占着统治的地位。因此，近年以来缅甸更多地采取了建立民族工业的方针，这也是自然的。
    一九五三年到一九五四年缅甸的一般生产水平达到战前水平的百分之八十点四，超过一九四六年—一九四七年水平百分之十九点二。根据官方的一九五四年工业调查材料，缅甸共有一千九百八十二个企业，在这些企业里工作的人在九万以上。
    铁路运输、邮电、对外贸易、财政系统都已掌握在国家手中。这在颇大程度上促进了缅甸经济的发展。近年来缅甸的对外贸易联系扩大了。缅甸联邦同东南亚所有的国家，许多西方资本主义国家以及我国、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、南斯拉夫及其他国家都进行着贸易。缅甸输入为发展民族工业所必要的设备，输出主要是农产品和工业原料。
    缅甸是一个农业国。全国人口的百分之七十都务农。他们大部是农民私有者、佃农和农业工人。在殖民地时期的缅甸，农业经济也是从属于外国垄断资本的利益的。战前，农产品在缅甸的总出口量中占百分之九十五。
    在过去的七年半中，独立的缅甸在发展农业上取得了显著成绩。播种面积在扩大，牲畜的头数也在增加。一九五二年到一九五三年稻谷的总收获量是五百七十四万吨，也就是说，比一九四六年到一九四七年的产量多一百七十七万二千吨。缅甸的芝麻、烟草、黍和小麦的生产已超过战前水平。
    但是缅甸联邦农业经济的发展仍然受到农村中现存的封建制度残余的极大束缚。一九四八年政府通过了土地国有化的法律，其中规定给地主以赔偿，而把这样赎买的土地重新分配给农民。所有面积超过五十英亩的地主所有地都必须收归国有。这项法律的实现时期预计为十年。预料在这项法律全部实现以后，农民将获得一千万英亩的土地。但是政府的这项措施遭到了地主的严重抗拒。
              ×　×　×
    缅甸联邦政府执行着爱好和平的外交政策，这个政策是以同其他国家友好合作与和平共处的原则为基础的。中缅两国总理就曾发表联合声明确认和平共处的五项原则。缅甸同我国、印度以及亚非两洲大多数国家的相互关系，就是建筑在这些原则之上的。
    大家知道，同印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和锡兰一道，缅甸政府也是召开万隆会议最积极的一个发起者，而万隆会议为缓和亚非地区的紧张局势作了很大的贡献。
    缅甸人民和政府在为巩固国际和平而积极斗争。缅甸曾经主张停止越南的军事行动与和平解决朝鲜问题，并且一贯支持恢复我国在联合国中合法地位的要求。缅甸人民同世界所有其他爱好和平的人民一道要求禁止大规模毁灭性的武器。在维护世界和平的事业中，缅甸人民和政府发挥着重要的作用。
