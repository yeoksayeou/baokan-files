    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Japanese opposition parties are actively preparing to question the Hatoyama government's foreign policy regarding the Japan-U.S. talks at the upcoming extraordinary session of the Diet.

    According to Kyodo News, the Japan Socialist Party (Left and Right wings) and the Liberal Party jointly dispatched representatives to Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama on the 11th to request an early convocation of an extraordinary Diet session. Prior to this, the three parties jointly held a meeting of the Diet Policy Committee chairmen on the 9th, deciding to focus on issues such as the Japan-U.S. talks and dispatching troops abroad at the joint conference of the Foreign Affairs and Cabinet Committees of the House of Representatives starting from the 15th, as well as other Diet committee meetings, and to interrogate cabinet members such as Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu.

    Meanwhile, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Right-wing Socialist Party, announced on the 9th that the Left and Right-wing Socialist Parties would submit a motion of no confidence against Shigemitsu and others at the extraordinary Diet session. Kyodo News said: The Left and Right-wing Socialist Parties believe that Shigemitsu's talks with the United States have only put Japan in a very tight bind. The two factions of the Socialist Party will attack the government's foreign policy of following the United States.

    Faced with strong opposition from the opposition parties, the Hatoyama government is planning to deny the issue of dispatching troops abroad; at the same time, it is also trying to postpone the date of the extraordinary Diet session in order to buy time and "harmonize" opinions with the Liberal Party.

    According to Kyodo News, the Liberal Party's attack on the Hatoyama Cabinet is an attempt to use this as an opportunity to develop the merger of conservative parties in a direction favorable to the Liberal Party.

    日本在野党准备就日美会谈问题质询鸠山
    新华社十一日讯　东京消息：日本在野党派正在积极准备在未来的国会临时会议中就日美会谈问题追究鸠山政府的外交政策。
    据共同社报道，日本左、右两派社会党和自由党十一日共同派代表向首相鸠山一郎提出了早日召开国会临时会议的要求。在这以前，三个政党曾在九日联合举行了国会对策委员会主席会议，决定在从十五日起举行的众议院外务、内阁两个委员会的联合协议会会议以及国会的其他委员会会议上，以日美会谈、派兵出国等问题为中心，向外务相重光葵等内阁阁员进行追究。
    同时，右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎在九日宣布，左、右两派社会党将在国会临时会议上，向重光葵等人提出不信任案。共同社说：左、右两派社会党认为，重光同美国会谈只是让美国给日本套上了很大的箍子。两派社会党将攻击政府追随美国的外交政策。
    面临在野党的强烈反对，鸠山政府对派兵出国的问题正打算采取否认的态度；同时，还在竭力设法推迟召开国会临时会议的日期，以便争取时间，同自由党“调和”意见。
    据共同社报道，自由党所以攻击鸠山内阁，是想借此使保守党派合并向着有利于自由党的方向发展。
