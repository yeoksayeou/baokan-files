To the Editor:
    The First Electromechanical Installation Engineering Company's violation of wage policies and waste of state funds is a very serious matter.

    This company was formed by the merger of the former East China and Shenyang Electromechanical Installation Companies. After arriving in Changchun, the employees of the former East China Electromechanical Installation Company uniformly enjoyed so-called "off-site living allowances." In August of last year, the Changchun Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and the People's Construction Bank of China, among other units, suggested that Changchun is not a forest area, remote region, or area with an adverse climate, and the "off-site living allowance" should be discontinued. However, even now, the company insists on paying this "off-site living allowance" to employees transferred from East China. This unreasonable allowance costs more than 20,000 yuan per month, totaling more than 300,000 yuan from last year to June of this year.

    Regarding the calculation of basic wages, the former Northeast Finance and Economics Committee stipulated that employees transferred from location A to location B should receive wages according to the standards and wage points of the new work area and new work position. However, this company violated this regulation and paid wages to employees from Shenyang according to Shenyang's wage points and to employees from East China according to Shanghai's wage points. After the Changchun Municipal Finance and Economics Committee raised concerns, starting from September of last year, they adopted an even more ingenious method of calculating employees' wages: first, they converted the wage points into cash based on Shenyang's or Shanghai's wage points, and then converted the cash back into wage points based on Changchun's wage points. As a result, these employees' wage points increased significantly. For example, the wage points of staff members from East China increased by about a quarter.

    The above-mentioned erroneous practices adopted by this company have created an unreasonable phenomenon of different pay for the same work among employees from different regions, thus damaging the production enthusiasm of some employees and affecting unity among employees. For example, last November, when two fifth-grade electricians, one from Shenyang and one from Shanghai, were performing electrical work at heights on site, the electrician from Shenyang said to the electrician from East China: "You earn more than me, you go up!"

    In addition, this company's distribution of cotton clothing subsidies and employee holiday travel subsidies is one-sidedly based on taking care of employees, without considering whether it violates national policies, which has also led to some unreasonable phenomena.

    I believe it is inappropriate for the leading staff of this company to repeatedly emphasize the special circumstances of their unit and repeatedly violate national policies and instructions from higher authorities. The basic construction leadership department of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry also bears some responsibility for the lack of inspection and supervision of this company's work, which has allowed the above phenomena to persist for a long time without correction.

### 第一机电安装工程公司违反国家工资政策

    第一机电安装工程公司违反国家工资政策编辑同志：
    第一机电安装工程公司违反工资政策，浪费国家资金的情况十分严重。
    这个公司是由原华东、沈阳机电安装公司合并成立的。到长春以后，原华东机电安装公司的职工一律享受所谓“异地生活津贴”。去年八月，长春市财经委员会和中国人民建设银行等单位都曾提出意见：长春并非林区、偏僻地区或气候不良地区，应该停发“异地生活津贴”。但是直到现在，这个公司还是坚持给从华东调来的职工加发“异地生活津贴”。这种不合理的津贴每月约开支两万多元，从去年到今年六月，共多开支三十多万元。
    在计算基本工资方面，前东北财经委员会规定：从甲地调到乙地的职工，工资标准、工资分值都按新工作地区、新工作岗位的标准支给。但是，这个公司却违反这个规定，对从沈阳来的职工都按沈阳工资分值发放工资，对从华东来的职工都按上海工资分值发放工资。经长春市财经委员会提出意见，他们从去年九月起对职工的工资又采取了更为巧妙的计算办法：先把工资分按沈阳工资分值或上海工资分值折算成现金，以后再按长春工资分值折算工资分。于是，这些职工的工资分大大增加了。例如这个公司从华东来的工作人员工资分都增加了四分之一左右。
    这个公司所采取的以上错误做法，造成了不同地区来的职工同工不同酬的不合理现象，因而损害了部分职工的生产热情，影响了职工之间的团结。例如，去年十一月，有两个五级电工，一个是沈阳的，一个是上海的，在现场进行电气高空作业时，沈阳来的电工就对华东来的电工说：“你赚的钱比我多，你上去吧！”
    此外，这个公司在发放棉衣补助费、职工放假回家补助费等方面，都是片面地从照顾职工出发，而不考虑是否违反国家的政策，因而也出现了一些不合理的现象。
    我认为这个公司的领导工作人员，一再强调本单位情况特殊，屡次违反国家的政策和上级的指示，这是很不应该的。第一机械工业部的基本建设领导部门对这个公司的工作缺乏检查和监督，以致上述现象长期没有得到纠正，也应该负一定的责任。
