Title: Haste Makes Waste

In the work of fixed grain production, purchase, and sales, there has been a phenomenon of rushing to meet deadlines and complete tasks. Some comrades, in order to finish the "Three Fixes" work quickly, have overlooked that this is a major political task that requires full mobilization of the masses, and a very complex economic task. They wanted to bypass the masses and activists, relying only on a few staff members to complete the task using some "simplest" methods. The result? They hit a wall. They either took a detour or created unnecessary complications.

In Yunfu County, Guangdong Province, such a situation once emerged. This county began its "Three Fixes" work on June 12th. At that time, the county committee leaders were impatient for quick results. At the expanded cadre meeting in the county, they did not seriously educate the cadres, but simply gave general lectures and assigned tasks. After returning to the villages, many township cadres simply gave cursory general lectures and did little detailed publicity and explanation work addressing the ideological problems of the masses. After doing this for more than ten days, there was no progress. But the task had to be completed. What to do? They had no choice but to "determine production based on the task," simply "determining" the output according to the needs of "completing the task." Naturally, the masses were dissatisfied with this, and the work immediately fell into a deadlock. Among the first batch of sixty-six townships to carry out the "Three Fixes" work, four-fifths were like this. After the Yunfu County Committee of the Communist Party of China was criticized by the higher-level party committee, it changed its approach, and the work quickly took on a different look. From June 25th onwards, they re-educated grassroots cadres in different zones and areas, dispelling their concerns and strengthening their confidence; then, they went deep into the layers, mobilized the masses, promoted democracy, and fully discussed the issues. More than ten days later, most of these sixty-six townships had done a good job of the "Three Fixes," and the masses were very satisfied; only a few townships that had not seriously and thoroughly mobilized the masses remained in a deadlock.

Some staff members believe that only by "feeling out" the situation household by household can production be accurately determined. Comrades working in Dongxiangzi, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, did not explain the policies clearly to the masses, but divided the work and went door-to-door to inquire about production. It took them ten days to inquire about more than a hundred households. This approach increased the concerns of the masses, and it became even harder to "feel out" the output. Comrades working in Zaoyang Township in this county took a different approach: first, they relied on rural backbone members, adjusted the reference indicators issued by higher authorities according to local conditions, and obtained the agreement of the backbone members of each village. Then, these backbone members divided the work and consulted with the masses, collected the opinions of the masses, researched and adjusted them, and then convened a general meeting to discuss and approve them. In the process of work, they explained to the backbone members and the broad masses of farmers the great significance of correctly assessing production, and tried to use the verified production of agricultural producers' cooperatives as a comparison when determining production. It took only four days to accurately assess production.

In Huimin Township, Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, seven of the eight villages fully mobilized the masses when carrying out the "Three Fixes" work. The socialist consciousness of the masses was raised, and they smoothly accepted the fixed production and grain retention standards, and were very motivated to strive for excess production. Only Lizicun did not seriously mobilize the masses, and the masses generally underreported production and overreported consumption. Later, they made up for the missed lessons and did a good job of the "Three Fixes" work. However, the time spent was doubled as a result—extending it by twelve days.

Using incorrect methods to pursue "speed" can only make things slower; using incorrect methods to pursue "simplicity" can only make things more troublesome. There have been enough lessons; let's not repeat them!

    欲速则不达

    在粮食定产定购定销工作中，发生了匆匆忙忙地赶时间、赶任务的现象。有些同志为了要把“三定”工作快些做完，就忽略了这是一项需要充分地发动群众的重大政治工作，是一项十分复杂的经济工作，想撇开群众和积极分子，只靠少数工作人员用一些“最简便”的办法来完成任务。结果呢？碰壁了。不是走了弯路，就是横生枝节。
    在广东省云浮县，就一度出现了这样的局面。这个县是六月十二日开始进行“三定”工作的。当时，县委领导同志急躁图快，在全县扩大干部会上没有认真教育干部，只讲了讲大道理就单纯布置任务。很多乡干部回乡后，也就只是草率地把大道理讲一讲，很少针对群众的思想问题进行细致的宣传解释工作。这样干了十几天，工作没什么进展。但任务又必须完成。怎么办呢？就只好“以任务套产量”，“简简单单”地按照“完成任务”的需要把产量“定”了下来。这样做，群众当然不满意，工作立即陷于僵局。在第一批开展“三定”工作的六十六个乡中间，就有四分之三的乡是这个样子。中共云浮县委受到了上级党委的批评以后，改变了做法，工作很快就出现了不同的局面。从六月二十五日起，他们重新分区分片教育基层干部，打消了基层干部的顾虑，增强了基层干部的信心；然后，层层深入，发动群众，发扬民主，充分讨论。十几天后，这六十六个乡中，绝大部分都把“三定”做好了，群众很满意；只有少数仍未认真深入发动群众的乡，僵局仍未完全打开。
    有些工作人员认为只有自己一户一户地“摸”才能把产量定准确。在陕西三原县东巷子工作的同志，没有向群众讲清政策，却分了工挨门上户查问产量。查问了一百多户，就用去了十天时间。这种做法使群众的顾虑更多了，产量更“摸”不清了。在这个县的枣阳乡工作的同志，采取了不同的做法：首先依靠乡村骨干分子，按当地情况调整了上级发下的参考指标，取得各村骨干分子的同意以后，再由这些骨干分子分工同群众协商，把群众意见集中起来作了研究、调整，再召开大会讨论通过。在工作过程中，向骨干分子和广大农民讲清了正确评产的重大意义，确定产量时尽量利用农业生产合作社核实的产量作比较，只用了四天时间就评实了产量。
    浙江嘉善县惠民乡的八个村，有七个村在进行“三定”工作时充分发动了群众，群众社会主义觉悟提高了，接受定产和留粮标准很顺利，争取超额增产的劲头很大；只有丽字村，没有认真发动群众，群众普遍少报产量、多报用量。后来重新补了课，才做好了“三定”工作。可是，时间因此多用了一倍——延长了十二天。
    用不正确的办法追求“快”，就只能使事情做得更慢；用不正确的办法追求“简便”，就只能使事情更麻烦。教训已经够多，不要再重复它了！
