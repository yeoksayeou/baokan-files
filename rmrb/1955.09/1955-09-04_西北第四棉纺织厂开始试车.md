The newly built state-owned Northwestern Fourth Cotton Textile Mill has begun trial production with some spindles and automatic looms. Since the trial production began, the lap forming rate of the scutcher has reached 98%, and the yarn breakage rate of the spinning frame is also relatively low. Those participating in the trial production are all skilled workers transferred from cotton textile mills in Qingdao, the Northeast, and the Northwest. During the installation and operation process, they studied and implemented advanced work methods such as the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the 1951 Weaving Work Method, and the 1953 Textile Machine Maintenance Work Method, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the trial production.

The state-owned Northwestern Fourth Cotton Textile Mill is scheduled to install 100,000 spindles, more than 26,000 thread spindles, and more than 3,200 looms. More than half of the workload has now been completed, and the installation work in the twisting and preparation workshops is nearing completion. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西北第四棉纺织厂开始试车
    新建国营西北第四棉纺织厂已有部分纱锭和自动布机开始试车。试车以来，清花机正卷率达到了百分之九十八，细纱的断头率也比较低。参加试车的都是青岛、东北和西北各棉纺织厂调来的熟练工人。他们在安装和运转过程中，学习并贯彻了郝建秀工作法，一九五一织布工作法和一九五三纺织机器保全工作法等先进工作法，因此保证了试车的顺利进行。
    国营西北第四棉纺织厂共要安装的十万个纱锭、二万六千多枚线锭和三千二百多台布机，现在已完成工作量一半以上，捻线、准备等车间的安装工程已接近完工。　（新华社）
