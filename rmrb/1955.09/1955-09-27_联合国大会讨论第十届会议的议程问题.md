Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 25th: According to TASS, the UN General Assembly held a meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd to discuss the agenda items for the tenth session. Most of the items proposed by the General Committee were adopted without discussion. However, those issues that had caused controversy in the General Committee were debated at the General Assembly meeting.
　　
Representatives from Greece, Britain, Turkey, Poland, the United States, the Soviet Union, India, and several other countries spoke on the Cyprus issue, which the majority of the General Committee had recommended not to include on the agenda.
　　
The head of the Greek delegation, Foreign Minister Stephanos Stephanopoulos, stated that Greece could not agree with those who, based on "strategic considerations," suggested abandoning the principle of self-determination for all the world's peoples. If the United Nations refused to listen to the voices of nations demanding the right to independence, it would only exacerbate the problem. He emphasized that Greece supported the Cypriot people's demand to decide their own destiny and that Greece would respect the Cypriot people's decision, whatever it might be.
　　
Representatives from Britain, Turkey, and the United States opposed including the Cyprus issue on the agenda, arguing that discussing the issue at the United Nations would only further deteriorate relations between the countries involved.
　　
Representatives from India, Iraq, and Thailand expressed support for the principle of self-determination but doubted whether it was necessary to discuss the Cyprus issue at the current session of the UN General Assembly.
　　
Representatives from Poland, the Soviet Union, and Ecuador supported including the issue on the agenda. Soviet Representative Kuznetsov said that the Cyprus issue had been included on the agenda of the ninth session of the UN General Assembly. However, the issue had not been resolved. He said that the Greek delegation's new request to include this item on the agenda was due to the fact that the situation regarding Cyprus had not improved and was deteriorating, and relations between the countries concerned had become more strained. Based on this, the Soviet delegation agreed to include the Cyprus issue on the agenda of this session and to thoroughly consider it.
　　
As a result of a roll-call vote, the General Assembly decided not to include the Cyprus issue on the agenda. Twenty-eight countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey, supported this decision. Twenty-two countries, including Greece, the Soviet Union, Ecuador, Egypt, Belarus, Poland, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, opposed it. Ten countries, including India, Burma, Indonesia, and the Philippines, abstained.
　　
The General Assembly will continue its meeting on the 26th.

    联合国大会讨论第十届会议的议程问题
    新华社二十五日讯　据塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：联合国大会二十三日下午会议讨论了第十届会议的议程问题。总务委员会所提出的项目大部分都未加讨论地被通过。但是那些曾经在总务委员会中引起争论的问题却在大会会议上进行了辩论。
    希腊、英国、土耳其、波兰、美国、苏联、印度和其他一些国家都就塞浦路斯问题发了言，这个问题是总务委员会的多数建议不要列入议程的。
    希腊代表团团长、外交部长斯特凡诺普洛斯说，希腊不能同意那些以“战略上的考虑”为理由建议废弃给全世界人民以自决权的原则的人的意见。如果联合国拒绝听取要求独立的权利的民族的意见，这只能够使这个问题恶化。他强调指出，希腊支持塞浦路斯人民自己决定自己的命运的要求，希腊将尊重塞浦路斯人民的决定，不论它是什么样的决定。
    英国、土耳其和美国的代表反对把塞浦路斯问题列入议程，他们说，在联合国讨论这个问题只会使有关国家的关系进一步恶化。
    印度、伊拉克和泰国代表表示支持自决原则，但同时怀疑是否需要在联合国大会本届会议上讨论塞浦路斯问题。
    波兰、苏联和厄瓜多尔代表赞成把这个问题列入议程。苏联代表库兹涅佐夫说，塞浦路斯问题曾经列入联合国大会第九届会议的议程中。但是，这个问题并没有得到解决。他说，希腊代表团关于把这一项目列入议程的新要求是由于下列事实所引起的：关于塞浦路斯问题的局势并没有改善而且在恶化着，有关国家之间的关系已变得更加紧张了。从这一点出发，苏联代表团同意把塞浦路斯问题列入本届会议议程并加以彻底的考虑。
    由于唱名表决的结果，大会决定不把塞浦路斯问题列入议程。美国、英国、法国和土耳其等二十八个国家支持这个决定。希腊、苏联、厄瓜多尔、埃及、白俄罗斯、波兰、乌克兰、阿富汗等二十二个国家表示反对，印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和菲律宾等十国弃权。
    大会将在二十六日继续举行会议。
