Chinese Cultural Delegation in Indonesia
Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation to Indonesia, Zhou Erfu

On the morning of July 6th, the weather was exceptionally clear. All members of the Chinese Cultural Delegation arrived in Bogor, famous for its beautiful scenery. The Presidential Office of Indonesia is located in the world-renowned Bogor Botanical Gardens. President Sukarno received us in his office today. From afar, we saw a tall, snow-white building on a green lawn, with a yellow flag fluttering in the breeze on the roof, signaling that the President was in the office. Our car passed through the lawn, and we saw countless deer leisurely pacing, heads held high, their tall antlers facing the vehicles on the road, as if welcoming us guests from China. The car drove to the side of that tall building, revealing an endless stretch of towering trees and a mirror-like lotus pond. Among the large patches of verdant, basin-shaped lotus leaves, shone purple-red water lilies, emitting a faint, delicate fragrance.

The Presidential Office is a garden within the grand Bogor garden.

President Sukarno, wearing a military uniform and a smile, stood at the entrance of the hall, shaking hands with each member of our delegation, and then introduced us to the Governor and Mayor of Bogor and other military and political leaders. President Sukarno first said to us:

"The people of Indonesia are very friendly to China. Not only is it so in Jakarta, Bogor, but also throughout Indonesia. Many cities and villages have written to me, asking me to find a way to have the Chinese Cultural Delegation visit and perform. The people of all parts of Indonesia welcome you. Your superb art has already caused a sensation throughout Indonesia after your first performance at the State Palace. The enormous glory and achievement you have gained make me wish I could become a member of your delegation."

Indeed, the people of all of Indonesia are very friendly to China. President Sukarno receiving and hosting the entire members of a foreign cultural delegation at the Presidential Office was a first in Indonesian history. And during our visit to Indonesia, every place we went proved every word of President Sukarno. Jakarta, the capital, goes without saying, let's talk about Yogyakarta, the ancient city of cultural and artistic center that we visited first after leaving Jakarta. We arrived at the border of the Yogyakarta Special Region at 9:30 pm on July 10th. As soon as the car arrived at "Changlongbalu", three kilometers from the city, the Yogyakarta Welcome Chinese Cultural Delegation Committee greeted us to the square inside, where there were thousands of people, a dark mass without end. They had been waiting for more than three hours, and when it got dark, they held up torches. A sea of fire illuminated the night sky on the equator of July. Under the illumination of the torches, amidst cheers, we passed through the crowded welcoming lines. Representatives gave us garlands of jasmine and orchids, and a rich fragrance spread out. The burning flames, enthusiastic cheers, and rich fragrance expressed the host's sincere hospitality. The welcoming crowd sang the Indonesian Independence Song. The chairman of the welcoming committee delivered a welcome speech: "Jasmine represents purity, and orchids represent intimacy. We put jasmine and orchids on you, hoping that the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian nations will always be pure and intimate." After the welcoming ceremony, the welcoming committee's band led the way in front of our car, playing music all the way to the Garuda Hotel in the center of Yogyakarta, where there were crowded welcoming crowds, and the road traffic was blocked. When we left Yogyakarta, it was also this band and some Indonesian friends who personally sent us to a place one hundred and eighty kilometers away - Moli Fen, playing music, singing, and cheering along the way, watching our backs disappear into the emerald tree-lined road, and then they reluctantly went back.

When we arrived in the downtown area of Surabaya, a commercial city, countless welcoming crowds stood along the road, waving to us kindly and cheering enthusiastically. No matter which city we went to, no matter which hotel we stayed in, let alone where we went to visit, we were warmly welcomed by the enthusiastic Indonesian people. Even in remote villages, or when a car passed through a small town, even six or seven-year-old children, seeing the words "Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China" written in Indonesian on the front of the car, and discovering that we were guests from China, they also raised their small hands and cheered to us:

"Hidup R.R.T! (Indonesian, meaning Long Live the People's Republic of China!)"

The Indonesian people love the Chinese people and also love Chinese art. The Indonesian government and people left us with deep and moving scenes in every city and every performance of the cultural delegation.

Let's first talk about the first performance at the State Palace of the Presidential Palace in Jakarta. That night, the President, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and all cabinet members attended to watch. After the performance, the President, Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister personally went to the stage to congratulate the success of the performance and took photos with all the members of the delegation. Soon, President Sukarno invited the cultural delegation to perform his favorite Chinese art programs at the Presidential Office in Bogor. The public performance on Independence Square in Jakarta caused a sensation throughout Jakarta. It started at 8 pm, and people started waiting in the square at 3 pm. By nearly 6 o'clock, the entire square was filled with fifty to sixty thousand people. Many people rented benches to watch, and the rental fee for a bench that could accommodate four people gradually rose from 20 shield to a high price of 100 shield. As long as they could see the performance of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, the renters were not stingy with this high price of 100 shield. One family of six only rented one bench, which could not accommodate everyone, so they adopted a rotation system. One person watched for a while and then came down to let another person go up to watch. Other people rode bicycles to watch, stood on the roofs of cars to watch, and some even climbed trees to watch. People said: The tall trees in Independence Square all bore "human" fruits that night. Because the "human" fruits were so plentiful, some tree trunks broke because they could not bear the burden. The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported under the title "Glorious Night": "With the assistance of clear weather and glorious moonlight, more than 100,000 citizens of Jakarta had the opportunity to appreciate the open-air public performance by the Chinese Cultural Delegation. The citizens of Jakarta have never had such concern and attention for any performance like this one."

The public performance on Medan Square was as grand as the performance on Independence Square in Jakarta. During the performance, the audience standing at the very back used mirrors to reflect the stage because they couldn't see it. The windows and doors of all the tall buildings around the square were opened, and many, many audience members sat far away in the windows to watch the performance in the square. On Singaraja Square in Bali, which is world-famous for its dance, more than half of the population of this art-filled city was appreciating the performance of the cultural delegation. And after the performance in Yogyakarta Square, the audience stood for more than half an hour, reluctant to leave. Because the Indonesian people love Chinese art so much, the reception committees in various places of the Indonesian government found it difficult to cope with the matter of issuing invitations. The Central Reception Committee in Jakarta was unable to cope with so many enthusiastic requests and had to ask the police to assist in maintaining order at the Central Reception Committee. Many people who couldn't get invitations from the reception committee went directly to the cultural delegation to find a way. Five young women, knowing that there was no way to get invitations from the cultural delegation and unable to see the performance, cried. Finally, they made a request: Please have the members of the cultural delegation sign their names for them, and then they left satisfied. Some couldn't even get autographs, and they felt satisfied as long as they could see the members of the cultural delegation at the cultural delegation's residence, the performance venue, or on the road. In short, the cultural delegation was surrounded by enthusiastic Indonesian people wherever it went. Governments and people from all parts of Indonesia asked us to visit and perform. One person in charge of the reception committee told us that if all their requests were met, then the cultural delegation would not be able to return to China for two years.

The Indonesian media gave extremely high evaluations to the cultural delegation's performances: The Mayor of Surabaya said: "The performance of the Cultural Delegation of the People's Republic of China is a brilliant flower of human civilization." The Director of the East Java Museum believes that the cultural delegation's performance is the best artistic performance he has seen in fifty years. The famous Indonesian director Sugati said that no one who sees the artistic performance of the Chinese Cultural Delegation is not moved unless they are reactionaries or half-dead people. The Mayor of Yogyakarta further said: The performance of the Chinese Cultural Delegation provides valuable experience for Indonesia on how to develop its traditional national culture and art and absorb excellent foreign culture and art.

China and Indonesia did not just begin to interact now. As early as more than a thousand years ago, friendly economic and cultural ties had been established. The fragments of Chinese Han Dynasty (around the second century) pottery unearthed on the main islands of Indonesia are proof of this. In the fifth to seventh centuries, famous Chinese monks such as Fa Xian and Yi Jing visited Indonesia one after another. China is also mentioned in the great epic of the heroic legend "Hang Tuah" in Indonesian classical literature. The legendary hero Hang Tuah visited China and fought against the colonialists who hindered his reconciliation with China. In Sanbao Long, I visited the Sanbao Cave: This is where the local people commemorate the landing of Eunuch Zheng He of Sanbao in Nanyang in the early fifteenth century. And many friendly stories also circulate everywhere between the overseas Chinese living in Indonesia and the Indonesian people: In Indonesia, the Lantern Festival and the Dragon Boat Festival are not limited to overseas Chinese, and the Indonesian people also participate in these two festivals. According to the customs of the Indonesian people, overseas Chinese also hold festival alms banquets, and there are also red and white porridge in the alms ceremony. The cultural exchange between China and Indonesia has produced "Jakarta-style Gamelan Music" (GAMBANGKROMONG), which uses Chinese notes, while the instruments are a mixture of Indonesian and Chinese.

In modern times, due to colonial rule, the exchanges between our two countries were artificially blocked. Since we each established new countries, the prime ministers of the two countries visited each other and issued a joint statement. On this new basis, the friendship between our two countries has developed day by day. The warm welcome of the Indonesian art delegation to China last year and the Chinese cultural delegation to Indonesia this year is not accidental. It reflects the development of the profound friendship between the two countries and reflects the wishes of the people of the two countries.

After a fifty-four-day visit to fifteen major cities in Indonesia, we left with extremely deep impressions in our minds. In particular, an old gentleman in Singaraja is unforgettable forever. After we performed at the Singaraja Square and returned to our residence, we saw an old gentleman, 68 years old, who was the owner of our team members' residence. He excitedly swayed back and forth in the living room, as if drunk, imitating the actions of the old boatman from the Peking Opera "Autumn River" encountering a storm, and then gave a thumbs up, expressing his sincere praise. Then he imitated the action of Yandang Mountain turning over the city, jumped up happily, and said "good" repeatedly. He believes that no matter how many times he is asked to watch the performance of the Chinese cultural delegation, he will not feel tired. He stretched out his left and right hands and held them tightly, indicating that China and Indonesia should cooperate closely and friendly. Finally, he spread his arms, and the left and right hands were close together, forming a circle, explaining that the Asian people should unite and strive for peace and the construction of their respective countries.

This old gentleman reflects the common demands of the Chinese and Indonesian people. May the profound friendship between China and Indonesia be consolidated and developed day by day!

    中国文化代表团在印度尼西亚
    中国访问印度尼西亚文化代表团副团长　周而复
    七月六日早晨，天气特别晴朗。中国文化代表团的全体团员到了以风景秀丽著名于世的茂物。印度尼西亚的总统行署就在这世界驰名的茂物植物园里。苏加诺总统今天在他的行署里接待我们。我们远远就看见一片绿茵茵草坪上有一幢高大的雪白的建筑物，屋顶上的一面黄旗在微风中飘扬，它告诉人们总统在行署里。我们的汽车经过草坪，看到无数的鹿在草坪上踱着方步，它们昂着头，露着高高的角，向路边的车辆望着，仿佛在欢迎我们这些来自中国的客人。车子开到那座高大建筑物的侧面，看到一望无尽的高耸入云的树林和平静如镜的荷花池，在一大片一大片的翠绿的盆状的荷叶中，闪耀着朵朵紫红色的睡莲，散发出清淡的幽香。
    总统行署是茂物这座大花园里的花园。
    苏加诺总统穿着军服含着微笑站在大厅门口，同我们代表团的团员一一握手，然后把茂物州长、市长和军政领导人员介绍给我们认识。苏加诺总统首先对我们说：
    “印度尼西亚人民对中国是很友好的，不但雅加达是这样，茂物是这样，全印度尼西亚各个地方的人民都是对你们友好的。很多城市和乡村的人们都写信给我，要求我想办法让中国文化代表团去访问去演出，印度尼西亚各地人民都欢迎你们去。你们高超的艺术使你们在国家宫第一次演出后，就已经轰动了整个印度尼西亚。你们所获得巨大的光荣和成就，使我自己都愿意变成你们团员中的一分子。”
    的确，全印度尼西亚人民对中国是很友好的。苏加诺总统在总统行署里接见和招待一个外国的文化代表团的全体人员，在印度尼西亚的历史上，这还是第一次；而我们在访问印度尼西亚期间，每到一个地方都证明苏加诺总统的每一句话。首都雅加达不必说了，就讲我们离开雅加达首先访问的日惹这座文化艺术中心的古老的城市吧。我们是七月十日晚上九点半钟到达日惹特区边界的。当汽车一开到市郊三公里的“长垄峇鲁”，日惹欢迎中国文化代表团委员会，就把我们迎接到里边的广场，那儿有数千群众，黑乌乌一片，看不见尽头，他们已经等了三个多小时，天黑了，就高举着火把。一片火海，把七月的赤道线上的夜空照得雪亮。在火把的照耀下，在欢呼声中，我们穿过拥挤的欢迎的行列，欢迎代表给我们戴上茉莉花和兰花的花环，一股浓郁的香味散发开去。燃烧的火焰，热情的欢呼和浓郁的芳香表达了主人的隆情厚谊。欢迎群众高唱了印度尼西亚独立歌。欢迎委员会主席致词欢迎：“茉莉花表示纯洁，兰花表示亲密。我们给你们戴上茉莉花和兰花，希望中国和印度尼西亚两个民族的友谊永远纯洁亲密。”欢迎仪式结束以后，欢迎委员会的乐队在我们汽车的前面领路，一边走着一边奏乐，一直把我们送到日惹市中心区的卡鲁达大旅馆，那儿又挤满了欢迎的群众，马路的交通都给阻断了。当我们离开日惹的时候，也是这个乐队和一些印度尼西亚的朋友们，亲自把我们送到一百八十公里以外的地方——茉莉芬，沿途奏乐，歌唱，欢呼，一直看着我们的背影消逝在翡翠一般的林荫道中，他们才依依不舍地回去。
    我们到达商业城市泗水市区的时候，沿途伫立着数不清的欢迎群众，几百人一排，向我们亲切地招手，向我们热情地欢呼。我们不管到哪个城市，也不论住在哪个旅馆，更不说是到什么地方参观，都受到热情的印度尼西亚人民热烈欢迎。就是在偏僻的乡村，或者是汽车经过一个什么小镇，即连六、七岁的小孩子，看见汽车前面用印度尼西亚文写的中华人民共和国文化代表团的字样，发现我们是从中国来的客人，他们也举起小手向我们欢呼：
    “Hidup　R．R．T！（印度尼西亚文，意思是中华人民共和国万岁！）”
    印度尼西亚人民热爱中国人民，也热爱中国艺术。文化代表团在每一个城市每一场演出，印度尼西亚政府和人民都给我们留下了深刻的动人的景象。
    先说在雅加达总统府国家宫第一次演出吧。那天晚上，总统、总理、副总理和内阁全体阁员都出席观看。演完以后，总统、总理和外交部长都亲自到舞台上祝贺演出成功，同全体团员一同拍照。不久，苏加诺总统又邀请文化代表团到茂物总统行署去演出他最喜爱的几个中国艺术节目。在雅加达独立广场公开演出，轰动了整个雅加达。晚上八点开演，下午三点钟就开始有人在广场等候了。快到六点的时候，整个广场就被五六万人站满了。许多人租了板凳来看，一张可以站四个人的板凳的租金从二十盾逐渐涨到一百盾的高价，只要能够看到中国文化代表团的演出，租的人毫不吝啬这一百盾的高价。有一家六个人只租到一张板凳，容纳不下，他们采取了轮换制，一个人看一会儿下来，让另外一个人上去看。另外有些人骑在脚踏车上看，站在汽车的顶上看，有的甚至爬到树上看。人们都说：独立广场的大树这一晚都结了“人”果，由于“人”果累累，一些树干因为负担不了而折断。印度尼西亚“人民日报”以“光辉的夜晚”为题，报道说：“在晴朗的天气和光辉的月光协助下，雅城十多万市民获得了欣赏中国文化代表团作露天公开演出的机会。雅城市民对任何演出从来不曾有过像这次这样的关怀和注意。”
    在棉兰广场公开演出也是和在雅加达独立广场演出一样的盛况。演出时，站在最后面的观众看不到舞台就用镜子的反射来看，所有广场四周的高大建筑物的窗门都打开了，许多许多观众远远地坐在窗口上看广场演出。在以舞蹈闻名于世界的峇里岛的辛格拉惹广场上，有这个充满了艺术气氛城市的半数以上的人口在欣赏文化代表团的演出。而在日惹广场演出以后，台下的观众伫立半小时以上，迟迟不想离去。由于印度尼西亚人民这样热爱中国艺术，使得印度尼西亚政府各地的招待委员会对于发请柬的事感到难于应付。在雅加达的中央招待委员会没有办法应付这样众多的热烈要求，不得不请警察到中央招待委员会来协助维持秩序。许多人到招待委员会要不到请柬，有的就直接到文化代表团来想办法了。有五位女青年知道从文化代表团这儿没有办法得到请柬，看不到演出，哭了，最后，提出一个要求：请文化代表团的团员们给她们签名，然后才满意地走了。有的连签名也得不到，只要在文化代表团的住处，演出的地方，或者是在路上能够看到文化代表团的团员们也就感到满意。总之，文化代表团每到一个地方就被热情的印度尼西亚人民包围着。印度尼西亚各地政府和人民都要求我们去访问和演出，招待委员会的一位负责人对我们说，如果都满足他们的要求，那么，文化代表团两年也回不了中国。
    印度尼西亚各地舆论对文化代表团的演出给予极高的评价：泗水市长说：“中华人民共和国文化代表团的演出是人类文明灿烂的花朵。”东爪哇博物馆主任认为文化代表团的演出是他五十年来所看到的最好的艺术表演。印度尼西亚著名导演苏加蒂说没有一个人看到中国文化代表团的艺术表演不被感动的，除非他是反动分子或者是半死的人。日惹市长进一步说：中国文化代表团的演出，为印度尼西亚如何发展它的传统的民族文化艺术和吸收外国优秀的文化艺术提供了宝贵的经验。
    中国和印度尼西亚不是现在才开始往来的，早在一千多年以前，就已经建立了经济和文化方面的友好联系。在印度尼西亚主要岛屿上发掘出的中国汉代（二世纪前后）陶器残片就是证明。在五世纪到七世纪，中国著名高僧法显和义淨等曾先后访问过印度尼西亚。在印度尼西亚古典文学英雄传奇“杭都亚”伟大叙事诗中，也曾说到中国。传奇中的英雄人物杭都亚曾访问过中国，并对阻挠他同中国修好的殖民者进行了斗争。我在三宝垅曾经到三保洞去参观：这是当地人民纪念十五世纪初三保太监郑和到南洋登岸的地方。而旅居印度尼西亚的华侨和印度尼西亚人民之间也到处流传许多友好的佳话：在印度尼西亚过元宵节和端午节不限于华侨，印度尼西亚人民也参加这两个节日。华侨依据印度尼西亚人民的习惯，也举行节日施舍宴会，在施舍仪式中同样有红粥和白粥。中国和印度尼西亚文化交流曾产生“椰加达式加美兰音乐”（GAMBANGKROMONG），这种音乐是使用中国音符，而乐器则由印度尼西亚的和中国的混合组成。
    近代以来，由于殖民主义的统治，曾经人为地阻隔了我们两国之间的往来。自从我们各自建立了新的国家之后，两国总理互相访问，发表了联合声明，在这新的基础上，我们两国之间的友谊日益发展了。去年印度尼西亚艺术代表团访问中国和今年中国文化代表团访问印度尼西亚受到两国人民的热烈欢迎不是偶然的，它反映了两国之间深厚友谊的发展，反映了两国人民的愿望。
    我们在印度尼西亚十五个主要城市进行了五十四天的访问以后，在我们的脑筋里留下极其深刻的印象，特别是辛格拉惹的一位老先生，叫人永远难忘。我们在辛格拉惹的广场演出以后，回到住处，看到一位有六十八岁高龄的老先生，是我们团员住处的主人，他兴奋地在客厅里摇来摆去，像喝醉了酒一般，模仿他刚才看到的京剧秋江老船夫遇到大风浪的动作，然后伸出大拇指，表示衷心的赞扬；接着又模仿雁荡山翻城的动作，高兴得跳了起来，连声说好。他认为只有中国文化代表团的演出，不管叫他看多少遍，他也不会感到疲倦。他伸出左右手来，紧紧地握着，表示中国和印度尼西亚应该亲密地友好合作。最后，他展开两臂，左右两手靠紧，形成一个圆圈，说明亚洲人民应该团结起来，为和平和建设各自的国家而努力。
    这位老先生反映出中国和印度尼西亚人民的共同要求，愿中国和印度尼西亚之间的深厚友谊日益巩固和发展！
