The Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China organized a study group of more than 110 people, who attended and observed each performance.

At the beginning of these three performances, the male and female gymnasts of the German Democratic Republic gave demonstration performances of various tumbling movements. They started with simple forward and backward rolls and progressed to complex movements such as forward and backward handsprings or forward and backward somersaults. Afterwards, the male athletes performed on the pommel horse, rings, floor exercise, parallel bars, and horizontal bar; the female athletes performed on the balance beam, uneven bars, floor exercise, and group hoop exercises. Each item and each wonderful movement they performed won warm applause from the audience. At the end of each group hoop exercise performance, the audience enthusiastically clapped in time with their steps, sending them off the field.

    新华社三日讯　应邀来中国访问的德意志民主共和国体育代表团体操队，在八月三十日和九月一日、三日三天晚上，向共达一万五千多名首都的观众作了三次精采的表演。
    国务院副总理兼体育运动委员会主任贺龙和中华人民共和国政府各部门负责人、中国人民解放军高级将领曾出席观看表演。中华人民共和国体育运动委员会组织了一百一十多人的学习队，每次都到场观摩学习。
    德意志民主共和国的男、女体操运动员在这三次表演开始时，都做了各种滚翻动作的示范表演。他们由简单的前、后滚翻动作开始，一直做到前、后手翻或前、后空翻等复杂的动作。以后，男运动员表演了鞍马、吊环、自由体操、双杠和单杠；女运动员表演了平衡木、高低杠、自由体操和集体藤圈操。他们表演的每个项目和每个精采的动作，都博得观众热烈的掌声。当每场的集体藤圈操表演结束后，观众都热情地配着她们的脚步，用掌声打起拍子，欢送她们走出场外。
