    The first phase of the Huayang River Flood Detention and Reclamation Project, spanning the provinces of Anhui and Hubei on the north bank of the Yangtze River, commenced in early August. Two hundred and twelve engineering personnel from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, responsible for construction, surveying, and river dredging, have begun surveying the construction site. Eight dredging vessels, suction dredgers, and mud barges dispatched by the Ministry of Communications have excavated a lagoon and begun dredging the intake channel.
    The Huayang River is a series of lakes and depressions located in the Jiangbian area encompassing three counties in Anhui Province (Susong, Taihu, and Wangjiang) and two counties in Hubei Province (Huangmei and Guangji). It stretches east to Wangjiang, is bounded by the remnants of the Dabie Mountains to the north, and reaches the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south, comprising over ten interconnected large and small lakes forming a vast lake district. These lakes are fed by rivers from the hilly area south of the Dabie Mountains on the north bank, which then discharge into the Yangtze River. Due to the increasing siltation of the drainage channels, the low-lying areas along the lakes are completely submerged every spring and summer due to mountain torrents and backflow from the Yangtze River. When the river level drops, the accumulated water in the lake area drains into the Yangtze River via the Huayang River very slowly. As a result, more than 400,000 mu of fertile lake beach land along the lake has been impossible to cultivate.
    In order to fundamentally control the water hazards of the Huayang River and develop agricultural production, the People's Government, after surveying, formulated a plan for the treatment of the Huayang River. The entire project is to be completed in two phases. The main projects in the first phase include repairing the original old Huayang River gate and constructing a new drainage gate and flood discharge channel at Yangwan Shen in Wangjiang County. These two sluice gates will work in coordination to prevent backflow from the Yangtze River and rapidly drain internal water, maintaining a certain flood storage capacity of the lakes. In addition, the project also includes the construction of the Huayang River dam and equipment for civil vessels to pass over the dam. The second phase of the project is planned to construct a large-scale flood diversion gate at Jianjialuan near Xiaogushan in Susong County. In years of extreme floods, it can divert a portion of the Yangtze River floodwaters into the lake to reduce the Yangtze River flood peak, ensuring the safety of the river embankments along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, especially the safety of the Tongma Dyke. After the completion of these several control projects, conditions will be in place to build a lake dike on the lake beach, reclaim more than 400,000 mu of lake beach land, and protect the people's embankments along the lake from waterlogging.

    华阳河蓄洪垦殖工程第一期工程开工
    长江北岸横跨安徽、湖北两省的华阳河蓄洪垦殖工程的第一期工程已在八月上旬开工。由长江水利委员会派来的施工、测量和疏浚河道的二百一十二名工程人员，已着手查勘工地。交通部派来的八只挖泥船、吸泥船、运泥船已挖好一个湖汶，开始疏浚进水道。
    华阳河是包括安徽省的宿松、太湖、望江三县和湖北省的黄梅、广济两县滨江地区的一带湖泊洼地，东到望江，北界大别山余脉，南抵长江北岸，共有互相连接的大、小湖泊十多个，构成一个广大的湖区。这些湖泊为北岸大别山南的丘陵地带的各河所注，然后泄入长江。由于泄水道日渐淤塞，每年春、夏季，山洪暴发，加以江水倒灌，沿湖低洼地区全被淹没。江水下落时，湖区积水由华阳河排泄入江速度很慢。因此，滨湖的四十多万亩土质肥沃的湖滩地一直无法垦种。
    人民政府为根治华阳河的水害，发展农业生产，经过勘测后拟订了华阳河整治计划。全部工程分两期完成，第一期工程中的主要工程，是修复原有的华阳河老闸，另在望江县的杨湾审新建一个排水闸和泄洪道，这两个水闸互相配合，可以防止江水倒灌和迅速排出内水，保持湖泊的一定蓄洪能力。此外，还要修筑华阳河拦河坝及民船过坝设备等工程。第二期工程，预计在宿松县的小孤山附近的詹家峦新建一座大型的分洪闸，遇到非常洪水年代，就可以分泄一部分江洪入湖，以削减长江洪峰，保障安徽省沿江的江河圩堤的安全，特别是保障同马大堤的安全。完成这几个控制性的工程后，就有条件在湖滩上修起一道湖堤，把四十多万亩湖滩开垦出来，并使滨湖的部分民圩免受涝灾。　（新华社）
