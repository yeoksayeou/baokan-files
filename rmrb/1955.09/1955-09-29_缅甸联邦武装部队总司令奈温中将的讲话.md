Mr. Minister of National Defense, leaders of the People's Republic of China, and distinguished guests:

We are the first military goodwill delegation to be invited to visit the People's Republic of China, and we feel very honored and grateful. We are endlessly grateful for the gracious hospitality we have received from the moment we arrived at the border of the People's Republic of China until we reached Beijing. To reciprocate this gracious hospitality, I would like to invite the People's Republic of China to send a military goodwill delegation to visit Burma, so that we can express our gratitude for the friendship of the People's Republic of China.

Our two countries have been very friendly since ancient times, but because Burma once lost its independence and China could not control its own destiny, the two countries were separated. But now both countries can control their own national destinies and have resumed exchanges. Our two countries have exchanged goodwill delegations, and the premiers of the two countries have visited each other. If our two countries continue to strengthen their economic and cultural ties in the future, I believe that the friendship between our two countries will be consolidated.

The friendship between our two countries, due to the dispatch of a military goodwill delegation from our country to visit the People's Republic of China, I believe that the friendship and friendly relations between the armies of our two countries will provide a favorable factor for the friendship between the people of the two countries.

Finally, I wish Mr. Minister of National Defense and the leaders of the People's Republic of China good health and longevity, and may they be able to serve the interests of their own country and people! (Xinhua News Agency)

    缅甸联邦武装部队总司令奈温中将的讲话国防部长先生，中华人民共和国的领导者们和各位敬爱的先生：
    我们是第一个被邀请到中华人民共和国来访问的军事友好代表团，我们感到非常荣幸和感谢。我们感谢不尽的是：在我们到达中华人民共和国的国境直到北京，都受到殷勤的招待。为了能够酬答这些殷勤的招待，我愿邀请中华人民共和国派遣军事友好代表团到缅甸去访问，这样，我们才能表示出对于中华人民共和国的友谊的酬答。
    我们两国自古以来是很友好的，但是，由于缅甸曾一度失去独立，中国也不能掌握自己的命运，使得两国有了隔绝。但是现在两国都能掌握自己的国家的命运，重新开始来往了，两国互相派遣了友好代表团，两国总理互相进行了访问，如果今后我们两国继续加强在经济和文化上的联系，我相信，我们两国的友谊是会得到巩固的。
    我们两国的友谊，由于我国派遣了军事友好代表团来访问中华人民共和国，我相信，我们两国军队之间的友谊与友好关系，将会对两国人民的友谊提供有利的因素。
    最后，我祝贺国防部长先生、中华人民共和国的领导者们的健康、长寿，为他们能为自己的国家和人民的利益服务而干杯！　（新华社）
