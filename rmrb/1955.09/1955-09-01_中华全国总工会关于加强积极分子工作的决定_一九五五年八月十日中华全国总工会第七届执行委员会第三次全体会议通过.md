The trade union is a mass organization of the working class voluntarily combined, a school of communism, and a link between the Party and the masses. The nature of the trade union determines that it can only invigorate its various tasks and give full play to its role in the communist movement by attracting and relying on the vast number of activists. The task of the trade union organization is to closely connect with the masses through its activities in all aspects, unite the broad masses around the Party, and strive to realize the Party's policies and propositions. To achieve these tasks, it is necessary to deeply understand the production, work, life, and ideological conditions of the workers and staff, specifically solve the problems of the masses, and gradually improve the awareness of the masses. It is necessary to practically rely on the workers and staff in all the work of the trade union, first and foremost on the activists among the masses. Activists live among the masses and have constant and intricate connections with the broad masses. Activists are the bridge between the trade union and the masses and the main source of cadres. If the trade union organization does not pay attention to attracting and relying on activists to carry out work, and does not maintain broad and constant contact with the broad masses of workers and staff through activists, it will not be able to deeply and timely reflect the emotions, demands, and opinions of the masses, and it will not be able to timely and thoroughly understand and solve various problems of the masses in their daily life, ideology, work, and production, and it will not be able to make the work deep and meticulous, and it will be separated from the broad masses.

In recent years, with the continuous improvement of the working class's awareness and the gradual development of trade union work, trade union organizations have achieved some successes and experiences in cultivating and training activists and giving play to their roles. At present, 2.73 million trade union activists have emerged across the country, that is, personnel who engage in trade union work in their spare time without leaving production, including grassroots trade union committee members, workshop committee members, members of various standing work committees, group leaders, group officers, etc. These activists have played a major role in various activities of the trade union. However, there are still many trade union organizations that lack due understanding of the extremely important issue of relying on the masses, especially relying on activists. Many trade union organizations do not pay attention to attracting and relying on activists to carry out work, but blindly increase institutions, expand staffing, and increase full-time cadres, which inevitably weakens the mass nature of the trade union organization, weakens the connection between the trade union and the workers and staff, and breeds bureaucracy and commandism. At the same time, too many full-time cadres will also increase administrative expenses, especially personnel administrative expenses, and reduce the funds for handling undertakings for the masses. Earnestly cultivating and training activists, widely attracting activists to participate in various tasks, fully exerting the role of activists, and resolutely overcoming bureaucracy and commandism to strengthen the connection between the trade union and the broad masses of workers and staff is an extremely important task in the current trade union construction. Therefore:

I. Trade union organizations at all levels must attach great importance to and practically strengthen the work of activists, must recognize that the work of activists is a fundamental issue in the construction of trade union organizations, must repeatedly criticize those views that do not believe in the wisdom and creativity of the masses and dare not and are unwilling to use activists, and firmly establish the idea that trade union work can only be done well by relying on the vast number of activists. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate the members and the masses so that they recognize that participating in trade union work and becoming an activist of the trade union is glorious, and serving the collective is a social obligation that every member should fulfill. Trade union organizations at all levels must conscientiously summarize the experience of activist work, take specific measures, and effectively improve activist work.

II. Trade union organizations at all levels must adhere to the democratic system stipulated in the trade union charter and regularly summarize work and re-elect institutions. Through summary and election, carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome shortcomings, and improve work. And through summary and election, systematically understand the work situation of activists, rectify and expand the ranks of activists in a planned way.

III. It is necessary to rectify institutions, reduce staffing, streamline full-time cadres in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law, and limit the expenditure of administrative funds. Trade union grassroots organizations should establish various necessary work committees according to the number of employees and the needs of work development, and absorb and rely on activists to carry out work; all departments, offices, and sections that are established should be abolished. Large factories and workshops can establish work committees for production, wages, rationalization proposals, labor protection, labor insurance, living quarters, and publicity, as well as committees for organization, finance, etc. Factories and mines with more female workers or concentrated families can establish female workers and family committees. According to work needs, organizations such as club committees, mutual aid savings societies, and sports associations can also be established. Trade union grassroots organizations should basically set up staffing according to the provisions of the Trade Union Law. Basic construction units and units with relatively weak work foundations, if they cannot temporarily meet the standards stipulated by the Trade Union Law, should also take specific steps to gradually meet the standards stipulated by the Trade Union Law. The staffing of full-time cadres at the grassroots level of trade unions should be calculated separately from the business staffing; the business staffing should also gradually implement fixed staffing, and business funds should not be used to support trade union administrative work cadres. The staffing of large factory and mine workshop committees: factories with 500 to 1,000 employees should have one full-time cadre, factories with 2,000 employees should have two, and factories with more than 2,000 employees should not exceed three.

IV. Trade union organizations at all levels must pay attention to correctly selecting and allocating activists. In the daily activities of the trade union, those who are active in production and work, closely connected with the masses, study hard, and are willing to participate in social activities should be selected and absorbed to participate in various trade union tasks, and those activists who are politically clear, have working ability, and are supported by the masses should be selected to various leadership positions. When assigning work positions to activists, attention should be paid to giving play to their strengths and personal interests, and their consent should be obtained; it should also be discussed with the masses and reported to relevant organizations for discussion and approval or election. When assigning work to activists, their concurrent positions should also be reduced and they should be given convenient conditions for work. During each election period, trade union grassroots organizations should concentrate their efforts under the leadership of the Party committee to carry out the selection and allocation of activists in a planned way, and oppose the practice of acting rashly based solely on personal impressions. In addition, attention should also be paid to using other active members, giving them temporary entrustments or assigning them one or two specific and simple tasks, so that they can receive training in participating in social activities and gradually cultivate them into trade union activists who can assume fixed positions.

V. It is necessary to effectively and systematically cultivate and train activists. Generally speaking, activists have higher work enthusiasm and a certain connection with the masses, but they generally lack professional knowledge of trade union work and specific work experience. If after assigning them work, they are not given patient and planned training and specific help, and are allowed to develop freely, they will not be able to improve well, and may even fall into depression and decline, so various organizations will become a formality and new cadres will not be able to grow. Therefore, after each election and after absorbing new activists to participate in work, they should be immediately given short-term spare-time training separately, explaining to them the basic knowledge of the trade union, and specifically explaining work responsibilities and work methods. In daily work, spare-time professional training or special training should also be carried out in combination with the important work of each period.

Trade union organizations should pay special attention to the daily cultivation and specific assistance to activists, always care about the growth of activists, organize and guide their cultural, technical, and political learning, improve their political, cultural, and technical level, and improve their class consciousness and working ability. When assigning work tasks to them, the policies and working methods should be repeatedly explained, and their work should be checked at any time, helping them to summarize work experience, overcome difficulties and shortcomings in their work, and encourage their work confidence and courage. And it is necessary to pay great attention to developing a democratic style, carrying out mass criticism and self-criticism, so that they always maintain close contact with the masses and continue to grow in their work.

Trade union organizations at all levels should, in accordance with the spirit of this decision, conduct a systematic inspection and summary of the work of activists, put forward plans and methods for improving the work of activists in the future, and report to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

    中华全国总工会关于加强积极分子工作的决定
    ——一九五五年八月十日中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第三次全体会议通过
    工会是工人阶级自愿结合的群众组织，是共产主义的学校，是党联系群众的引带。工会的性质决定了它只有吸引并依靠广大积极分子，才能使各项工作活跃而有生气，才能充分发挥它在共产主义运动中的作用。工会组织的任务，是通过它在各方面的活动，密切地联系群众，把广大群众团结在党的周围，为实现党的政策、主张而努力。要实现这些任务，就必须深入地了解职工群众的生产、工作、生活和思想状况，具体地解决群众的问题；逐步地提高群众的觉悟程度；就必须在工会的一切工作中切实地依靠职工群众，首先是依靠群众中的积极分子。积极分子生活在群众当中，同广大群众有千丝万缕的经常的联系。积极分子是工会联系群众的桥梁，是生长干部的主要源泉。如果工会组织不注意吸引并依靠积极分子进行工作，不通过积极分子同广大职工群众保持广泛而经常的联系，就不能深入地、及时地反映群众的情绪、要求和意见，就不能及时地、透彻地了解和解决群众日常生活上、思想上、工作上、生产上的各种问题，就不能使工作深入细致，就会脱离广大群众。
    几年来，随着工人阶级觉悟程度的不断提高和工会工作的逐步开展，工会组织在培养训练积极分子和发挥他们的作用方面，已经获得了一些成绩和经验。目前全国已涌现出二百七十三万工会积极分子，即不脱离生产的在业余时间从事工会工作的人员，包括工会基层委员、车间委员、各种常设工作委员会的委员、小组长、小组干事等。这些积极分子，在工会的各种活动中都起了重大作用。可是也还有不少工会组织，对于依靠群众首先是依靠积极分子这样一个极端重要的问题，还缺乏应有的认识。很多工会组织不注意吸引和依靠积极分子进行工作，而是盲目地增设机构、扩大编制、增加专职干部，这就必然削弱工会组织的群众性，削弱工会同职工群众的联系，滋长官僚主义和命令主义作风。同时专职干部过多，也就会增加行政费的开支，特别是人事行政费的开支，减少为群众办理事业的经费。认真地培养与训练积极分子，广泛地吸引积极分子参加各项工作，充分地发挥积极分子的作用，坚决地克服官僚主义、命令主义作风，以加强工会同广大职工群众的联系，是目前工会建设中的一项极其重要的任务。因此：
    一、工会各级组织必须十分重视与切实加强积极分子的工作，必须认识积极分子工作是工会组织建设中的根本问题，必须反复地批判那些不相信群众的智慧与创造能力而不敢和不愿运用积极分子的观点，牢固地树立只有依靠广大积极分子才能作好工会工作的思想。同时也必须教育会员群众，使他们认识参加工会工作成为工会的积极分子是光荣的，为集体服务是每个会员应尽的社会义务。工会各级组织必须认真总结积极分子工作的经验，采取具体措施，有效地改进积极分子工作。
    二、工会各级组织必须坚持执行工会章程所规定的民主制度，定期地总结工作和改选机构。通过总结和选举，开展批评与自我批评，克服缺点，改进工作。并通过总结与选举，有计划地了解积极分子的工作情况，整顿与扩大积极分子的队伍。
    三、必须整顿机构，紧缩编制，依照工会法的规定精简专职干部，限制行政经费的开支。工会基层组织应根据职工人数的多少与工作发展的需要，建立各种必需的工作委员会，吸收并依靠积极分子进行工作；凡是设有部、室、科的，应一律撤销。大型的工厂和车间可设生产、工资、合理化建议、劳动保护、劳动保险、生活住宅、宣传等工作委员会和组织、财务等委员。女工较多或家属集中居住的厂矿可建立女工、家属委员会。根据工作需要，还可以建立俱乐部委员会、互助储金会和体育协会的组织。工会基层组织都应基本上按工会法规定设置编制。基本建设单位和工作基础比较薄弱的单位，如果一时不能达到工会法所规定的标准，也应采取具体步骤，逐步达到工会法规定的标准。工会基层专职干部的编制应同事业编制分开计算；事业编制也应逐步实行定员，不得挪用事业费供养工会行政工作干部。大厂矿车间委员会的编制：职工五百至一千人的设专职干部一人，二千人的设二人，二千人以上的也不能超过三人。
    四、工会各级组织必须注意正确地挑选和配备积极分子。在工会的日常活动中，应挑选和吸收那些生产、工作积极，密切联系群众，努力学习，愿意参加社会活动的人分别参加工会各项工作，并把那些政治上清楚，有工作能力，为群众所拥护的积极分子选拔到各种领导岗位上来。分配积极分子的工作职务时，应注意发挥其特长和个人的志趣，并征得其本人同意；还要同群众商量，报告有关组织讨论批准或进行选举。分配积极分子工作时，还应减少他们的兼职，给予他们工作上的便利条件。工会基层组织在每届选举期间，应在党委的领导下，集中力量有计划地进行积极分子的挑选和配备工作，反对只凭个人印象轻率从事的做法。此外，还应当注意运用其他积极的会员，给他们以临时的委托或分配给他们一两件具体的简单的工作，使他们得到参加社会活动的锻炼，逐步地培养他们成为能担负固定职务的工会积极分子。
    五、必须切实地有计划地对积极分子进行培养、训练。一般说来，积极分子都有较高的工作热情，同群众也都有一定的联系，但对工会工作的业务知识和具体的工作经验却一般是缺乏的。如果分配他们工作之后，不给以耐心的有计划的培养训练和具体帮助，任其自流地发展，他们就不能很好地提高，甚至陷于苦闷消沉，因而各种组织便会流于形式，新的干部便不能生长起来。因此，在每届选举之后和吸收新的积极分子参加工作之后，应立即分别地对他们进行业余的短期训练，向他们讲解工会的基本知识，具体地交代工作职责和工作方法。在日常工作中还应结合各个时期的重要工作，进行业余的专业训练或专题训练。
    工会组织应当特别注意对积极分子的日常培养和具体帮助，时刻关心积极分子的成长，组织和指导他们的文化、技术和政治学习，提高他们的政治、文化、技术水平，提高他们的阶级觉悟和工作能力。在向他们布置工作任务时，要反复交代政策和工作方法，并随时检查他们的工作，帮助他们总结工作经验，克服工作中的困难和缺点，鼓励他们的工作信心和勇气。并且要十分注意发扬民主作风，开展群众性的批评与自我批评，使他们永远同群众保持密切的联系，在工作中不断地成长起来。
    工会各级组织应根据这个决定的精神，对积极分子工作进行一次系统的检查和总结，提出今后改进积极分子工作的计划和办法，报告全国总工会。
