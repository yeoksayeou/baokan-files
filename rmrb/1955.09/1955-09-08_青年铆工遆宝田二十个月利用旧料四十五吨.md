    Young riveter Di Baotian, a model worker of Beijing's industry, who works in the freight car workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and his work area, have utilized 166 tons of scrap materials in the past year and a half, saving the state more than 75,000 yuan. The saved new materials are enough to refurbish 240 freight cars. Di Baotian, who first suggested using scrap materials, utilized 45 tons of scrap material in one year and eight months.

    Last year, Di Baotian discovered that in the scrap pile on the factory's plaza, there were many old angle iron, channel iron, iron plates, and many discarded parts that were six to seven tenths as good as new, but they were all sent to the iron smelting furnace to be melted down, and few people used them. Di Baotian suggested to the administration and the Communist Youth League organization to use these scrap materials, which are only one-fifth of the price of new materials.

    The foreman of this work area, Chen Chonggui, contacted the dismantling workshop to understand the material requirements in advance, and looked for scrap materials first. The workers also ensured that new materials were never used when scrap materials were available, and ensured that scrap materials were not wasted on small projects.

    The workers paid close attention to the quality of the freight cars refurbished with scrap materials and strengthened quality inspections. Therefore, the quality of the repaired freight cars was very good.

    青年铆工遆宝田二十个月利用旧料四十五吨
    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂货车车间青年铆工、北京市工业劳动模范遆宝田所在的领工区，到目前为止的一年半的时间里，利用了旧料一百六十六吨，为国家节省了资金七万五千多元。节省下来的新料可以装修二百四十辆货车。最先建议利用旧料的遆宝田在一年零八个月的时间里，就利用了四十五吨旧料。
    去年遆宝田发现工厂广场上的废料堆里有许多六、七成新的旧角铁、槽铁、铁板和许多废弃的零件都送进了熔铁炉熔炼，很少有人利用。遆宝田就向行政和团组织建议利用这些只相当新料价格的五分之一的旧料。
    这个领工区的工长陈崇贵和解体车间联系，事前了解需料情况，先去找旧料，工人们也作到有旧料决不用新料，还保证旧料不大材小用。
    工人们都非常注意利用旧料装修的货车质量，加强了质量检查，因此修好的货车，质量都很好。
