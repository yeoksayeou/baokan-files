    A Developing Industrial City
    Wu Xiang, Chun Xun
    Taiyuan is one of China's important industrial cities. With the progress of the country's socialist industrial construction, it is changing its appearance day by day. In 1949, when it was first liberated, the city's population, including the suburbs, was only 270,000. With the development of production, the urban population has now reached more than 500,000.
    Since liberation, the number of buildings added to Taiyuan is equivalent to more than seven-tenths of the original total building area. The city's construction has crossed the old city walls and expanded outwards. Before liberation, under the rule of the war criminal Yan Xishan in Shanxi Province, the suburbs of Taiyuan were dotted with bunkers and grass taller than a person. Now, such a desolate scene can no longer be seen. What can be seen are factory chimneys 40 to 50 meters high, huge factory buildings, and new residences for the working people stretching one after another...
    Taiyuan has extremely favorable conditions for developing industry. Because Shanxi Province is a famous "home of coal and iron," the reserves of both coal and iron are very large; the reserves of gypsum, which can be used as a secondary raw material for cement and can also be used to manufacture sulfuric acid and fertilizer powder, are also extremely abundant; in addition, various non-ferrous metal mineral deposits include gold, silver, copper, lead, aluminum, etc., and non-metallic mineral deposits include saltpeter, mirabilite, pond salt, dolomite, limestone, quartz stone, mica, and pottery clay. Shanxi Province is so rich in mineral resources, and Taiyuan is located in the central part of the province, with relatively convenient transportation, and it already has a certain industrial base. These are all good conditions for Taiyuan to carry out large-scale industrial construction.
    Originally, Taiyuan had a considerable variety of industries, including steel, machinery manufacturing, coal mining, electric power, chemical industry, cement, food, paper making, leather, printing, and so on. Although the machinery and equipment of these factories and mines were backward in the past and their production capacity was very low, after liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and through the efforts of all employees, not only has their own production been greatly developed, but they have also strongly supported the country's industrial construction. Taking the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant as an example, it was just a very messy mess at the time of liberation. Over the past six years, the state has allocated huge investments and systematically renovated and expanded it, gradually balancing the production equipment capacity and greatly expanding the production range. Now, it has completely changed its dilapidated appearance in the past and has developed into a large-scale enterprise, supplying the country's socialist construction with various steel products, and has trained a large number of technical personnel. At present, Taiyuan has sent a large number of metallurgical engineers and veteran skilled workers to all parts of the country. In the future, it will continue to send a large number of technical personnel to support the steel industry construction in various parts of the motherland.
    If the development speed of Taiyuan's industrial construction in the past few years since liberation has been exciting, then its magnificent prospects in the future will be even more exciting. In order to adapt to the development of production in Taiyuan's original factories and mines, and to provide these newly built factories with strong power, a modern thermal power plant—the Taiyuan Thermal Power Station—began construction in October 1953 with the help of the Soviet government, and partial power generation began at the end of 1954. When its entire project is completed, its power generation will be three times the existing power generation in Taiyuan. The most prominent feature of this new type of factory is that it has modern machinery and equipment, and many heavy tasks are performed by machines instead of manual labor. The adjustment of the entire combustion system load of the plant is also carried out automatically by machines, and it can automatically adjust the wind pressure, water pressure, air pressure, air volume, steam volume, coal powder volume, and various temperature changes. The workers on duty in this factory only need to regularly inspect and maintain various automatic machines and instruments.
    When Taiyuan began to build new industries and vigorously transform existing industries, batches of workers and technicians came here from coastal cities. Zhang Changgen, deputy director of the First Forging Workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, was originally a worker in the forging workshop of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. When he came to Taiyuan, he first lived in a dilapidated small house and forged iron under a mat shed and worked as a teacher at a technical school. At first, he was not used to this kind of life and was once uneasy, but encouraged by the Party's education and the enthusiasm for building the motherland's interior, he resolutely stayed and worked very well. Now, he is directing the workers to operate huge machines, and he, his wife, and children have moved into the newly built workers' dormitory. Technical workers who came to Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory from Shanghai spread their advanced technology, changing the past situation of poor product quality and high prices. The variety of knitted products has also increased, and now inexpensive and high-quality knitted products have been sold throughout Shanxi.
    The new China's industrial city—Taiyuan—is growing. At night in the industrial area north of the city, the iron-making furnaces and coking furnaces emit red light when iron and coke are produced, illuminating half the city in red; boxed metallurgical and mining machinery equipment and new-style agricultural implements are shipped in large quantities to various places; trains carrying cement and coal travel to and from the north and south; and trucks carrying machinery equipment and building materials are often seen running busily on the streets. This prosperous scene cannot help but make people think of Taiyuan's more beautiful future in the socialist industrialization construction of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    发展中的一个工业城市
    吴象　春旬
    太原市是我国的重要工业城市之一，随着国家的社会主义工业建设的进展，它正在日新月异地改变自己的面貌。一九四九年刚解放时，全市人口包括郊区在内不过二十七万人，随着生产的发展，现在城区人口已达五十多万人。
    解放以来，太原市增加的建筑物，相当于原有建筑总面积的十分之七强，市区的建筑已经越过旧的城墙，向外扩展。解放前，战犯阎锡山统治山西省的时候，太原城郊到处是星罗棋布的碉堡和比人还高的蒿草。现在呢，再也见不到那种荒凉的景象了，所看到的是四、五十公尺高的工厂的大烟囱、巨大的厂房、一片连着一片的劳动人民的新住宅……
    太原有发展工业的极其优越的条件。因为山西省是著名的“煤铁之乡”，煤和铁的蕴藏量都非常大；作为水泥的副原料，并可制造硫酸、肥田粉的石膏的埋藏量也极为丰富；此外，各种有色金属的矿藏有金、银、铜、铅、铝等，非金属矿藏有硝石、芒硝、池盐、白云石、石灰石、石英石、云母、陶土等。山西省的矿藏如此丰富，太原市又地处全省中部，交通相当便利，且原已有一定的工业基础，这都是太原市进行大规模工业建设的良好条件。
    原来，太原市产业种类相当多，包括钢铁、机器制造、煤矿、电力、化学工业、水泥、食品、造纸、皮革、印刷等等。虽然这些厂矿过去的机械设备落后，生产能力很低，但解放后在党和人民政府的正确领导下，经过全体职工的努力，不仅使本身的生产有了很大的发展，而且有力地支援了全国的工业建设。以太原钢铁厂为例，解放时还只是个十分零乱的烂摊子。六年来，国家拨出了巨额的投资，有计划地对它进行了改建和扩建，使生产设备能力逐渐得到平衡，并大大地扩大了生产范围。现在，已经完全改变了过去破旧的面貌，发展成为一个规模较大的企业，给国家的社会主义建设供应了各种各样的钢铁产品，而且培养了大批技术人材。现在，太原市已向全国各地输送了大批冶金工程师和老技术工人，今后，还将继续输送大量的技术人材去支援祖国各地的钢铁工业建设。
    如果说，解放几年来太原市工业建设的发展速度已令人兴奋，那末，它今后宏伟的远景就将更加令人兴奋了。为了适应太原市原有厂矿生产的发展，使这些新建的工厂得到强大的动力，从一九五三年十月在苏联政府的帮助下，又开始建设了一座现代化的火力发电厂——太原电热站，一九五四年年底已开始部分发电了。它全部工程完工后的发电量，将等于太原现有发电量的三倍。这个新型工厂最鲜明的特点是拥有近代化的机械设备，许多笨重的工作，都由机械代替人工进行。全厂整个燃烧系统的调整负荷的工作，也是由机械自动进行，并能够自动调整风压、水压、气压、空气量、蒸气量、煤粉量以及各种温度的变化。在这个厂子中值班的工人，只要经常检查和维护各种自动机械和仪表就可以了。
    当太原市开始建设新型工业、对原有工业进行大力改造的时候，成批成批的工人和技术人员从沿海城市来到这里。太原重型机器厂第一锻压车间副主任张长根，原是上海机床厂锻工车间的工人。他来到太原，开始住在破旧的小屋里，在席棚下面打铁，当技工学校的教员。起初，他过不惯这种生活，曾经一度不安心，但在党的教育和建设祖国内地的热情鼓舞下，他坚决地留下来了，而且工作得很好。现在，他在指挥工人们操纵巨大的机器，他和他的妻子、小孩都搬到新建成的工人宿舍中去了。从上海来到太原晋生纺织厂的技术工人，把他们的先进技术作了传播，使这个厂改变了过去产品质量低劣、售价昂贵的状况。针织品的品种也增多了，现在物美价廉的针织品已行销山西各地。
    新中国的工业城市——太原市，正在成长。在城北工业区的夜间，炼铁炉出铁、炼焦炉出焦时都发出红光，照红半边城；装了箱的冶金、矿山机械设备、新式农具从这里大批大批发运各地；装运水泥、煤炭的列车，南来北往；街道上也常常看到装载机械设备和建筑材料的卡车繁忙地奔跑。这种繁荣的景象，不禁使人们想到在祖国社会主义工业化建设中太原市更美丽的未来。（附图片）
