    New Teaching Plan Implemented in Primary Schools Nationwide Starting This New Academic Year
    Starting this new academic year, primary schools nationwide will implement the "Primary School Teaching Plan" and the "Instructions on Implementing the Primary School Teaching Plan" recently issued by the Ministry of Education. This will initiate basic production technology education (i.e., comprehensive technology education) and strengthen labor education and physical activities to ensure the correct implementation of the comprehensive development education policy.
    In addition to increasing the weekly class time for natural science in the sixth grade, the new teaching plan has specifically added a "Manual Labor" course from the first to the sixth grade. This is to connect teaching with subjects such as nature, geography, language, and arithmetic, produce teaching aids and toys, and conduct activities such as plant cultivation and animal breeding. This will enable students to acquire some basic production knowledge, learn to use some simple production tools, and cultivate a communist attitude towards labor. In terms of physical education, in addition to extracurricular physical exercises, the time for physical education classes has been increased from the first to the fourth grade. In order to appropriately reduce the excessive academic burden on students and achieve the goal of more effectively improving the quality of education, the new teaching plan reduces the total number of class hours per week and appropriately streamlines the teaching materials and class hours for subjects such as language, arithmetic, and history. The number of teaching weeks per academic year has been changed from the original thirty-eight weeks to thirty-four weeks.
    In order to ensure that the new teaching plan can be connected with the old teaching plan, the Ministry of Education has instructed all regions and schools to adopt the following transitional measures: schools that do not have manual labor teachers may postpone the addition of this subject until the autumn of 1956; if language, history, and other subjects continue to use old textbooks, the provinces and cities should appropriately streamline them; the sixth grade of this academic year will not add manual labor courses and may not reduce the total weekly teaching time. Ethnic minority primary schools that use their own national language for teaching may have the autonomous regions or provincial and municipal education administrative departments formulate teaching plans with reference to this teaching plan and submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval.

    全国小学从新学年起实行新的教学计划
    全国小学从新学年起，将根据教育部最近颁发的“小学教学计划”和“关于执行小学教学计划的指示”，开始实施基本的生产技术教育（即综合技术教育）和加强劳动教育及体育活动，以保证全面发展的教育方针得到正确的贯彻。
    新的教学计划除了第六学年每周增加一节自然科上课时间外，从第一学年到第六学年特别增设了“手工劳动科”，以便联系自然、地理、语文、算术等各科进行教学，制作教具、玩具，并作植物栽培、动物饲养等活动，使学生获得一些基本的生产知识，学会使用一些简单的生产工具，培养共产主义的劳动态度。在体育方面，除课外的体育锻炼外，从第一到第四学年增加了体育课时间。为了适当减轻学生过重的学业负担，以达到更有效地提高教育质量的目的，新教学计划中，减少了每周上课的总时数，并且适当地精简了语文、算术、历史等科的教材和上述科目的上课时数。每学年上课周数由原来的三十八周改为三十四周。
    新的教学计划为了能和旧的教学计划相衔接，教育部指示各地、各校得采用以下一些过渡办法：如没有手工劳动课教师的学校，可延至一九五六年秋季再增设此科；语文、历史等科如继续使用旧课本，得由各省市予以适当精简；本学年度的六年级不增设手工劳动科，并可不减少每周教学总时间。凡用本民族文字教学的民族小学，可由自治区或省、市教育行政部门参考本教学计划另定教学计划，报教育部批准执行。　（新华社）
