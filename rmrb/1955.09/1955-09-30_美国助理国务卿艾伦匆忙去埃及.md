Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 29th. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs, George Allen, left Washington on the 28th to go to Egypt to discuss matters related to Egypt purchasing armaments.

The U.S. State Department announced this news only three minutes before Allen's departure. Allen hinted to reporters before his departure that he was making this "hurried trip" on the orders of the State Department because Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser announced in a speech on the 27th that he had signed a barter agreement to exchange Egyptian cotton and rice for armaments from Czechoslovakia. In his speech, Nasser stated that Egypt refused to accept the conditions proposed by the United States for supplying it with armaments, namely, that Egypt participate in the "common security treaty." Nasser believed that these conditions infringed upon Egypt's independence and freedom.

Allen said that he hoped to consult with Nasser. He said that he would do his best to "demonstrate American policy." He also pointed out that if Egypt wanted to buy armaments from the United States, it would have to "contribute to common defense" and "only proceed according to a cash payment system."

Allen also announced that he would subsequently go to Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, and Athens, the capital of Greece.

    美国助理国务卿艾伦匆忙去埃及
    新华社二十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿乔治·艾伦在二十八日离开华盛顿去埃及，讨论有关埃及购买军火的事情。
    美国国务院是在艾伦启程之前三分钟才宣布这个消息的。艾伦在行前向新闻记者暗示，他奉国务院的命令作这次“匆忙的旅行”，是因为埃及总理纳赛尔在二十七日发表的演说中宣布已经签订了以埃及棉花和大米换取捷克斯洛伐克军火的换货协定。纳赛尔在演说中曾表示埃及拒绝接受美国提出的要埃及参加“共同安全条约”作为供应它军火的条件。纳赛尔认为，这种条件是侵犯埃及的独立和自由的。
    艾伦说，他希望同纳赛尔磋商。他说，他将尽其所能“表明美国的政策”。他并且指出，埃及要向美国购买军火，就要“对共同防御有所贡献”，并且“只能按照现金支付制度”来进行。
    艾伦还宣布，他随后还将去黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特和希腊首都雅典。
