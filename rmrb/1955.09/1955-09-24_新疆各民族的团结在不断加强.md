Unity is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary cause. In the Xinjiang region, strengthening national unity is a crucial key to doing all work well. Without this, it is inconceivable to do any work well.

Before liberation, the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang suffered from exploitation and oppression for a long time under the bloody rule of the reactionary ruling class. Suspicion, hatred, and distrust filled the relations between the nationalities, which led to their long-term backwardness in economy, culture, and other aspects.

The victory of the Chinese people's revolution enabled the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to be liberated along with the people of the whole country, realizing equality among all nationalities in politics, thus ending the tragic fate of being exploited and oppressed forever. The phenomena of estrangement and division among the nationalities were eliminated, and a new relationship of equality, friendship, unity, and mutual assistance began to be established.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang established people's governments at all levels based on national unity, carried out a series of political movements and social reforms such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, reforming the land system, resisting America and aiding Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and general elections, stabilizing social order and improving the patriotic and internationalist consciousness and enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities. Thanks to the cordial care of the Central Government for the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang and the selfless, fraternal assistance of the friendly Soviet Union, we have developed agricultural and animal husbandry production and transportation. Before liberation, there was almost no modern industry in Xinjiang. After liberation, many modern industries have been established. By the end of 1954, the output of various major crops had increased by 65.44 percent, various livestock had increased by 42 percent, the irrigated area had expanded by 1.3 times, electricity had increased by 37 times, coal production had increased by 31 times, and flour production had increased by 7 times. As a result, financial prices have been stabilized, and the material and cultural life of the people of all nationalities has been improved and elevated day by day.

In the past six years, through the practical experience and special training of various social reform movements, more than 36,000 cadres of all nationalities have been trained, including more than 2,600 leading cadres and key personnel. Many local ethnic cadres have served as full-time or deputy leaders in leading positions such as commissioners, county heads, and directors and chiefs of departments and bureaus. In their work, they can proceed from unity, help each other, and consult on matters, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of various tasks.

The Central Government has long pointed out that the general task of the Party in the transition period regarding national issues is: to consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and to jointly build the great family of the motherland; within the unified family of the motherland, to guarantee the equality of all nationalities in all rights and implement national regional autonomy; in the development of the common cause of the motherland, to closely cooperate with the construction of the motherland, and gradually develop the political, economic, and cultural aspects of all nationalities (including steady and necessary social reforms), and gradually eliminate the factual inequalities between nationalities left over from history, so that backward nationalities can join the ranks of advanced nationalities and transition to socialist society. Under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee, the Provincial People's Government began to gradually promote national regional autonomy at all levels from the bottom up in the Xinjiang region since October 1953. The establishment of ethnic autonomous regions and autonomous organs at all levels has further consolidated national equality and strengthened the unity between and within all nationalities.

In the process of establishing ethnic autonomous regions at all levels, Han cadres and people, who account for the majority of the population, and Uyghur cadres and people have been able to adopt a positive attitude of support and enthusiastic help to the nationalities implementing regional autonomy, winning the respect and love of the people of all fraternal nationalities, and being affectionately called "elder brothers" by them. Similarly, the people of all nationalities implementing regional autonomy can also follow the example of the Han nationality in the whole country and the Uyghur nationality in the whole Xinjiang in uniting, helping, and taking care of all fraternal nationalities to unite, help, and take care of other nationalities in the autonomous region. For example, when the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture elected representatives to the People's Congress of the Autonomous Prefecture, the Kazakh people took the initiative to give up eight representative seats in order to take care of other nationalities, especially fraternal nationalities with smaller populations, thereby gaining the trust and support of all fraternal nationalities and further strengthening unity. In Bayingoleng Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Hoboksar Mongolian Autonomous County, Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County, and other regions, some long-standing and deep-rooted disputes over pastures, land, and agriculture and animal husbandry have been satisfactorily resolved with the spirit of helping, taking care of, and making concessions to other nationalities by the nationalities implementing regional autonomy.

The continuous strengthening of national unity and the establishment of autonomous regions at all levels have greatly promoted mutual assistance and cooperation among the people of all nationalities in production. Before the establishment of Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County, when Xibe farmers caught locusts, Kazakh herdsmen were unwilling to participate, and some even said, "The farmland belongs to the Xibe people, we are herdsmen, this has nothing to do with us." After the establishment of the autonomous county, more than 300 Kazakh herdsmen, men and women, in the sixth district of the county voluntarily helped catch locusts and said to the Xibe farmers, "Catching locusts is not only your business, we also have a responsibility." For example, in Hoboksar Mongolian Autonomous County, some Mongolian herdsmen in the past were unwilling to let Kazakh herdsmen cut grass in their surplus pastures. After the establishment of the autonomous county, twelve Mongolian herdsmen in the first district of the county voluntarily allowed nineteen Uyghur and Kazakh herdsmen who lacked pastures to cut more than 27,000 bundles of grass in their pastures without compensation. They said, "The difficulties of the Kazakh folks are also the difficulties of our autonomous region's big family, and we should help solve them."

The establishment of autonomous regions and the strengthening of unity education for the people of all nationalities have also strengthened the unity within nationalities and further improved vigilance. Many regions have combined the publicity work of national regional autonomy to mediate many historical estrangements and disputes within their own nationalities, making the unity within nationalities increasingly consolidated and strengthened. For example, there was a serious phenomenon of disunity between the Hasimu Xia Ke tribe and the Tarbake tribe in Wuqia County, Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture. The masses of the two tribes did not speak to each other when they met, did not intermarry, and cursed each other. After the publicity and education of national regional autonomy, both sides achieved reconciliation on the basis of mutual respect and self-criticism. They criticized themselves and said, "How can we do a good job of regional autonomy and be masters of our own affairs if we are not united internally?" Both sides firmly guaranteed to unite closely and jointly do a good job in the work of the autonomous region. Landlords in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture who were overthrown attempted to undermine the unity within nationalities, and bad elements from outside the Zireyong Xiati Tajik Autonomous Region in Shache County carried out conspiracies to split sects. Their sabotage activities were exposed and crushed because the masses improved their vigilance during the establishment of autonomous regions.

In addition, there are countless vivid examples of all nationalities celebrating festivals together, visiting and congratulating each other, and experienced masters in various enterprise and mining production departments enthusiastically and patiently passing on technology and skills to apprentices of other nationalities.

In the past six years, thanks to the resolute implementation of the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the consolidation and strengthening of national unity, the restoration and development of production, and the training of a large number of ethnic cadres, especially the gradual implementation of national regional autonomy at all levels on the basis of national unity, favorable conditions have been created and a solid foundation has been laid for the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. After a long period of preparatory work, the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been officially approved by the Central Government on October 1 this year. There is no doubt that the establishment of this autonomous region will further strengthen the unity of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, enhance the patriotic and internationalist ideological consciousness of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, encourage the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to participate in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the great motherland together with the people of the whole country, and further develop the political, economic, and cultural undertakings in the Xinjiang region, as well as further improve and elevate the living standards of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang. It will have a huge impact and positive promotion effect. This is a great happy event for the Uyghur people and other nationalities in Xinjiang, and even for all nationalities in the country. This is another historic victory for the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, another major progress in the implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy in our country, and also the result of the correct implementation of ethnic policies by the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the Provincial People's Government, the continuous consolidation and strengthening of national unity, and the sincere, selfless, and fraternal assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and Han cadres. Based on the above, continuing to consolidate and strengthen the unity among the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang is of particular importance. After the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and autonomous organs, it is necessary to continue to resolutely implement the policies, instructions, and resolutions of the Central Government in the autonomous region under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and the Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC, and with the enthusiastic help of Han cadres and people, and to vigorously carry out propaganda and education on patriotism, internationalism, and national unity to the people of all nationalities in the autonomous region, and actively give play to the spirit of the majority nationalities uniting, helping, and taking care of the minority nationalities in order to achieve common development and progress of all nationalities. The Uyghur nationality in Xinjiang, like the Han nationality in the whole country, is the main nationality. Uyghur cadres and people must actively and enthusiastically unite, help, and take care of other nationalities, just as the Han people actively and enthusiastically unite, help, and take care of all fraternal nationalities throughout the country. At the same time, after the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, we should warmly welcome the sincere and selfless assistance of Han people and cadres to all fraternal nationalities. This is because the Han people and cadres have long-term revolutionary training and experience. In the long revolutionary struggle, they not only won the liberation of their own nation, but also liberated other fraternal nationalities within China, and then fully helped all fraternal nationalities to establish their own happy lives. Only under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and the Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC, and with the enthusiastic help of Han cadres and people, can we further consolidate and strengthen national unity, can the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang thoroughly realize their rights as masters of their own affairs, can we vigorously develop the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the autonomous region, and can we enable backward nationalities to join the ranks of advanced nationalities and jointly transition to socialist society together with the people of all nationalities in the country. This is the firm belief and determination of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang.

Finally, on the occasion of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, we sincerely thank the Central Government and Chairman Mao for their earnest care for the people of Xinjiang, and extend our cordial thanks to the Han people and cadres who enthusiastically help the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, as well as to the great friendly Soviet Union that helps the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to carry out economic construction.

    新疆各民族的团结在不断加强
    新疆省人民政府主席　鲍尔汉
    团结是革命事业胜利的根本保证。在新疆地区，加强民族团结又是做好各项工作的重要关键。没有这一条，要做好任何工作都是不可设想的。
    解放前，新疆各族人民在反动统治阶级的血腥统治下，长期遭受着剥削和压迫，各民族之间充满了猜忌、仇视和互不信任，因而在经济、文化等各方面长期处于落后的状态。
    中国人民革命的胜利，使新疆各族人民随同全国人民一起获得解放，在政治上实现了各民族一律平等，从而永远地结束了受剥削、受压迫的悲惨命运。各民族间消除了隔阂、分裂的现象，开始建立了平等友爱、团结互助的新关系。
    解放后，新疆各族人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在民族团结的基础上，建立了各级人民政权，进行了镇压反革命、改革土地制度、抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”、普选等一系列的政治运动和社会改革，安定了社会秩序，提高了各族人民爱国主义和国际主义的觉悟和积极性。由于中央对新疆各族人民的亲切关怀，以及友邦苏联的无私的、兄弟般的帮助，我们发展了农、牧业生产和交通运输事业，兴修了水利。解放前新疆几乎没有现代化的工业，解放后建立起了许多现代化的工业。截至一九五四年底，各种主要农作物产量增加了百分之六十五点四四，各种牲畜增加了百分之四十二，灌溉面积扩大了一点三倍，电力增加了三十七倍，煤炭产量增加了三十一倍，面粉产量增加了七倍。从而稳定了金融物价，日益改善和提高了各族人民的物质和文化生活。
    六年来，经过各种社会改革运动的实际锻炼和专门训练，培养了各族干部三万六千多人，其中仅领导干部和骨干就有二千六百多人。许多本地民族干部担任了专员、县长和厅长、处长等领导工作的正职或副职。他们在工作中均能从团结出发，互相帮助、遇事商量，从而保证了各项工作的顺利进展。
    中央早经指出，过渡时期党在民族问题方面的总任务是：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设伟大祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族在一切权利方面的平等，实行民族区域自治；在祖国的共同事业的发展中，与祖国的建设密切配合起来，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济、文化（其中包含稳步的和必要的社会改革在内），逐步消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后的民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，过渡到社会主义社会。在党中央，中央人民政府和中共中央新疆分局的统一领导下，省人民政府自一九五三年十月开始，在新疆地区从下而上逐步地推行了各级民族区域自治。由于各级民族自治区和自治机关的建立，进一步巩固了民族平等，加强了各族人民之间和各民族内部的团结。
    在建立各级民族自治区的过程中，占人口多数的汉族和维吾尔族干部和人民，对实行区域自治的民族均能采取积极支持和热情帮助的态度，取得了各兄弟民族人民的尊敬和热爱，被他们亲切地称为“老大哥”。同样地，实行区域自治的各民族人民，也能仿照汉族在全国、维吾尔族在全疆团结、帮助和照顾各兄弟民族的榜样，去团结、帮助和照顾自治区内的其他民族。如伊犁哈萨克族自治州在选举出席自治州人民代表大会代表时，哈萨克族人民为了照顾其他民族，特别是照顾人口较少的兄弟民族，曾主动地让出八名代表名额，从而获得了各兄弟民族的信任和支持，进一步加强了团结。巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州、博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州、和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县、察布查尔锡伯族自治县等地区内一些渊源很深、历史很久的牧、草场纠纷、土地纠纷、农牧纠纷等，也都在各实行区域自治的民族本着对其他民族帮助、照顾、让步的精神，得到了圆满的解决。
    不断加强民族团结和各级自治区的建立，大大促进了各族人民在生产中的互助合作。察布查尔锡伯族自治县成立前，锡伯族农民捕蝗时，哈萨克族牧民都不愿参加，有的还说：“农田都是锡伯族的，我们是牧民，这与我们无关。”自治县成立后，该县六区有三百多名哈萨克族男女牧民自动帮助捕蝗，并对锡伯族农民说：“捕蝗不仅是你们的事，我们也有责任。”又如，在和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县，过去有些蒙族牧民不愿让哈萨克族牧民在自己多余的草场内打草。自治县成立后，该县第一区十二户蒙族牧民，曾自动地让十九户缺少草场的维吾尔、哈萨克族牧民无代价的在自己草场内打草两万七千多捆。并说：“哈族老乡的困难，也就是我们自治区大家庭的困难，我们应该帮助解决。”
    自治区的建立和对各族人民加强团结教育的结果，也加强了民族内部的团结，进一步提高了警惕性。许多地区曾结合民族区域自治的宣传工作，调解了不少历史上遗留下来的、本民族内部的隔阂和纠纷，使民族内部的团结日益巩固和加强。如克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州乌恰县的哈斯木下可部落和塔尔巴克两部落间，在历史上曾存在着严重的不团结现象。两部落的群众见面互不说话、互不结亲、彼此咒骂。经过民族区域自治的宣传教育后，双方在互相尊重和自我检讨的基础上获得了和解。他们自己检讨说：“我们内部不团结还能搞好区域自治当家作主吗？”双方坚决保证要亲密团结起来，共同搞好自治区的工作。昌吉回族自治州被打倒的地主企图破坏民族内部团结，和莎车县孜热甬下提塔吉克族自治区外来坏分子进行分裂教派的阴谋活动，都因建立自治区过程中群众提高了警惕性而将其破坏活动揭发和击破了。
    此外，各民族间共同欢渡节日、互相拜贺，在各企业厂矿生产部门老师傅热情耐心地向其他民族的徒弟传技术、教本领等生动事例，更是不胜枚举。
    六年来，由于坚决贯彻了中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策，巩固和加强了民族团结，恢复和发展了生产，培养了大批民族干部，特别是在民族团结的基础上，逐步推行了各级民族区域自治，这就为建立新疆维吾尔自治区创造了有利的条件和打下了坚实的基础。经过长时期的筹备工作，已经中央批准本年十月一日正式建立新疆维吾尔自治区。毫无疑问，这一自治区的建立，对于进一步加强新疆各民族人民的团结，对于提高新疆各族人民的爱国主义和国际主义思想觉悟，对于鼓舞新疆各族人民同全国人民一道参加伟大祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，对于进一步发展新疆地区的政治、经济、文化事业，以及进一步改善和提高新疆各族人民的生活水平，都将产生巨大的影响和积极的推进作用。这是新疆维吾尔族人民和其他各族人民以至全国各族人民的一件大喜事，这是中国共产党和毛主席民族政策的又一历史性的胜利，这是我国推行民族区域自治政策的又一重大进展，这也是中共中央新疆分局、省人民政府正确执行民族政策、不断地巩固和加强民族团结以及驻新疆人民解放军和汉族干部真诚、无私、兄弟般帮助的结果。基于上述，继续巩固和加强新疆各民族人民之间的团结，就更具有特殊的重要意义。新疆维吾尔自治区和自治机关建立后，必须在党中央、中央人民政府和中共自治区委员会统一领导下，以及汉族干部和人民的热情帮助下，在自治区内继续坚决地贯彻中央的政策、指示和决议，继续向自治区内各族人民大力进行爱国主义、国际主义和民族团结的宣传教育工作，积极发挥多数民族团结、帮助和照顾少数民族的精神，以求得各民族共同发展和进步。维吾尔族在新疆的地位，正如汉族在全国一样，是主体民族。维吾尔族干部和人民必须如同汉族人民在全国范围内积极热情地团结、帮助和照顾各兄弟民族一样，去积极热情地团结、帮助和照顾其他民族。同时，新疆维吾尔自治区成立后，我们更应热烈地欢迎汉族人民和干部对各兄弟民族真诚无私的帮助。这是因为汉族人民和干部有长期的革命锻炼和经验，他们在长期革命斗争中不仅争取了本民族的解放，同时也解放了中国境内的其他兄弟民族，并进而全力帮助各兄弟民族建立起自己的幸福生活。只有在党中央、中央人民政府和中共自治区委员会统一领导下，以及汉族干部和人民的热情帮助下，进一步巩固和加强民族团结，新疆各族人民才能彻底实现当家作主的权利，才能大力发展自治区内的政治、经济和文化，才能使落后的民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，同全国各族人民一道共同过渡到社会主义社会。这是新疆各族人民坚定不移的信念和决心。
    最后，在新疆维吾尔自治区成立之际，我们衷心感谢中央、毛主席对新疆人民的殷切关怀，并向热情帮助新疆各族人民的汉族人民和干部，以及帮助新疆各族人民进行经济建设的伟大友邦苏联致以亲切地谢意。
