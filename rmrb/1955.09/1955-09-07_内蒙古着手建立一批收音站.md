    Inner Mongolia Starts to Establish a Batch of Radio Stations
    The People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has decided to establish 575 radio broadcast stations before October of this year.
    Among these radio stations, 389 are specifically for agricultural, pastoral, and fishery production cooperatives. The other 186 will be established in remote areas and ethnic minority areas with inconvenient transportation. Currently, all the equipment needed to establish these radio stations has been successively shipped from Hohhot, Hailar, and other places.
    After these radio stations are established, they will play a significant role in strengthening the connection between various parts of the autonomous region and the national construction cause, as well as in preventing wind and snow disasters on the grasslands. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古着手建立一批收音站
    内蒙古自治区人民委员会决定在今年十月以前建立五百七十五处广播收音站。
    这批收音站中，有三百八十九处是专为农业、牧业、渔业生产合作社建立的。另外一百八十六处将建立在边远地区和交通不便的少数民族地区。现在，建立这批收音站用的一切器材设备，已由呼和浩特，海拉尔等地陆续运出。
    这批收音站建立后，对加强自治区境内各地以及同国内建设事业的联系，对草原上预防风雪灾害，都将起很大的作用。　（新华社）
