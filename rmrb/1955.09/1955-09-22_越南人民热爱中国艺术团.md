    The Vietnamese People Love the Chinese Art Troupe
    The most common reflection from Hanoi audiences is that Chinese art is so close to the Vietnamese people that many programs can be understood even without explanation. Audiences not only felt particularly close to the Vietnamese songs sung by the art troupe in Vietnamese, such as "Ode to the Vietnamese Labor Party," "Ode to Ho Chi Minh," "Selflessly for the People," "Dien Bien Phu Victory," and the Bac Ninh folk song "White Crane"; they also expressed heartfelt welcome to the Chinese song and dance programs performed by the art troupe. Almost every performance, the "Lotus Dance" was performed more than twice at the persistent request of the audience. Vietnamese artists were very willing to meet with the Chinese "Lotus Dance" performers, asking about the creative process and performance methods of this beautiful dance. Vietnamese artists said that the Vietnamese people, like the Chinese people, love lotus flowers and have composed many songs to praise the purity and nobility of lotus flowers: "Yellow stamen, white petals, green leaves, leaning on the mud without being tainted by the smell"; "The most beautiful thing in Dong Thap Muoi is the lotus flower, and the most beautiful name in Vietnam is Ho Chi Minh." Every time the announcer announced the words "Lotus Dance," the audience erupted in long-lasting applause and cheers. Quang Hung, a trade union worker, said: The hearts of the Vietnamese and Chinese people are closely linked together. Our people jointly love lotus flowers, love peace, and love a happy life. For this noble purpose, we are advancing side by side on a road of struggle. The "Lotus Dance" reminds the Vietnamese people of the beautiful Dong Thap Muoi grasslands in the south where lotus flowers bloom, and strengthens the Vietnamese people's determination and confidence to consolidate peace and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland on the basis of independence and democracy. The mini-dance dramas "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance," "Tibetan Cavalry Dance," and "Flag" performed by the Chinese art troupe were also warmly applauded by Hanoi audiences. The Hanoi audience praised the highly nationalistic flute and suona solos, the female solo of Henan Opera "Hua Mulan," "Hongniang," and the Chinese classical song and dance dramas such as "Lion Dance," "San Cha Kou," and "Uproar in the Dragon Palace." Minh Tang, a famous Vietnamese historian, said: "Watching the rich and colorful performances of the Chinese art troupe suddenly evoked many precious memories." He said: The Vietnamese people are very familiar with "Romance of the West Chamber," "Water Margin," and "Journey to the West." He and many friends loved these beautiful stories and myths in their childhood and were deeply influenced by the heroic characters in them, which had a certain impact on their later active participation in the national democratic movement. Therefore, in the past, not only the feudal comprador reactionary rulers of China hated these stories and myths, but also the feudal traitors and imperialist colonists of Vietnam were also afraid of these stories and myths. They had conspired to take various means to block and prohibit them, but they never achieved their goals. These artistic images and rich legends created by the genius of the Chinese people and loved by the Vietnamese people have been spreading among the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people love Sun Wukong very much and usually call him "Qitian Dasheng" (Great Sage Equal to Heaven). This time, through the performance of the Chinese art troupe, the Vietnamese people can see this lovely "Qitian Dasheng" making trouble in the Dragon Palace, which is particularly exciting and cordial.
    People in Hanoi's cultural and art circles are very happy to see the performances of the Chinese Art Troupe. Nguyen Xun, chairman of the Vietnam Association of Literary and Art Workers and an old writer, said: "Vietnamese literary and art workers can learn specifically from the programs performed by the Chinese Art Troupe, which can be summarized by the six words 'great, young, and happy,' how to master Chairman Mao Zedong's literary and art thoughts, and follow President Ho Chi Minh's instructions to vigorously explore and develop their own nation's excellent culture and art." He believes that this visit and performance by the Chinese Art Troupe is an indelible page in the history of Vietnamese people's culture and art. Vu Ngoc Phan, a famous writer and historian, said: "Although the cultural exchanges between the Vietnamese and Chinese people started very early and have continued ever since, this is the largest cultural exchange activity in the history of the two peoples, with China sending an art troupe of 170 people and Vietnam sending a song and dance troupe of 58 people to visit and perform for each other." He believes that such direct, organized, and large-scale cultural exchange activities will increase in the future. This will have a great effect on further consolidating the fraternal friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people and promoting the development of the culture and art of the two countries.
    The Vietnamese people deeply love the Chinese Art Troupe, and they regard the art troupe as cultural envoys and representatives of the Chinese people. During the Chinese Art Troupe's performance in Hanoi, many young people quietly rode bicycles around the art troupe's residence. They wanted very much to see every member of the art troupe, but they were afraid of waking up the "Chinese brothers and sisters." At the performance, you can often see this situation: many people want to applaud more, but they urge each other to applaud less, because they are afraid that the actors will be too tired if they bow and repeat their performances too many times. An old lady in Gia Lam District, Hanoi, who has been addicted to eating betel nuts for decades, would rather not eat betel nuts for a whole day in order to kiss the female members of the Chinese art troupe when presenting flowers. Many young workers, farmers, and students have agreed that they will take the hardworking, serious, and responsible spirit of the Chinese art troupe in the performance as their benchmark and intensify their work and study. Tran Duy Khang, a student at Nguyen Trai Middle School in Hanoi, said in a letter to the Chinese art troupe that he guarantees to study hard and serve the motherland and the people well; Qiao Huilun, a student at Dien Bien Intermediate College, said in a letter that in order not to live up to the "brothers and sisters'" high degree of internationalism, he is determined to resolutely respond to President Ho's call for "five loves" of loving the motherland, loving labor, loving learning, loving science, and loving morality. Vietnamese youth, like their closest relatives, make guarantees or vows to the Chinese Art Troupe. When Hanoi youth, women, the elderly, and children meet members of the Chinese Art Troupe, they always remember to ask them to say hello to Uncle Mao and the Chinese people on their behalf.
    The Chinese Art Troupe is now living very happily in the love of the Vietnamese people. They encourage each other and are determined to continue to do a good job in the visit and performance, and humbly learn from the excellent culture and art of the Vietnamese people in order to respond to the love and care of the Vietnamese people, fulfill the entrustment of the people of the motherland, and work hard for the friendship and prosperity of the Chinese and Vietnamese people.

    越南人民热爱中国艺术团
    河内观众最普遍的一种反映是：中国的艺术和越南人民是这样的接近，以至有许多节目不加以说明也能看懂。观众们不仅对艺术团用越南话唱的越南歌曲“歌颂越南劳动党”、“歌颂胡志明”、“忘我为人民”、“奠边府大捷”、北宁民歌“白鹤”等，感到特别亲切；同时对艺术团表演的中国歌舞节目，也表示由衷地欢迎。几乎每一次演出会，“荷花舞”都是在观众的坚持邀请下表演两次以上，越南的艺术家非常愿意和中国“荷花舞”的演员们聚首，询问这个优美的舞蹈的创作经过以及表演的方法。越南的艺术家们说，越南人民也和中国人民一样地喜爱荷花，并且编了许多歌谣来歌颂荷花的纯洁、高尚：“蕊黄、花白、叶青，倚污泥而不染腥味”、“同塔梅最美丽的是荷花，越南最美丽的名字是胡志明。”每当报幕报到“荷花舞”三个字的时候，全场就响起经久不息的掌声和欢呼声。工会工作者光兴说：越、中两国人民的心是紧紧地联结在一起的，我们的人民共同热爱荷花、热爱和平、热爱幸福的生活，为了这个崇高的目的我们并肩在一条斗争的道路上前进。“荷花舞”使越南人民时刻记得荷花盛开的美丽的南方同塔梅水草平原，增强越南人民为巩固和平、争取在独立和民主的基础上以和平方式统一自己祖国的决心和信心。中国艺术团表演的“采茶扑蝶舞”、“藏民骑兵舞”和“旗”等小型舞剧，也受到了河内观众热烈的喝采。对于富有强烈的民族色彩的笛子和锁呐独奏、女声独唱河南梆子“花木兰”、“红娘”，以及“狮子舞”和“三岔口”、“闹龙宫”等中国古典歌舞剧，河内观众更称赞不绝。越南著名的历史学家明增说：“看了中国艺术团丰富多采的表演，使人突然引起了许多珍贵的回忆”。他说：越南人民对于“西厢记”、“水浒传”、“西游记”等是很熟悉的，他自己和许多朋友小时候就十分喜爱这些美丽的故事和神话，并深受那里面的英雄人物的感染，这对于他们后来积极参加民族民主运动有着一定的影响。因此，过去不仅中国的封建买办反动统治者那样憎恨这些故事和神话，越南的封建卖国贼和帝国主义殖民者也很害怕这些故事和神话，它们曾阴谋采取种种手段来封锁禁绝，但是始终没有达到目的。这些由中国人民天才塑造成而受到越南人民热爱的艺术的形象以及丰富的传说，一直在越南人民中间传播着。越南人民非常喜爱孙悟空，通常都称呼它作“齐天大圣”。这次通过中国艺术团的表演，越南人民又能看这位可爱的“齐天大圣”在闹龙宫，感到特别兴奋和亲切。
    河内文化艺术界人士很高兴看到中国艺术团的演出。越南文学艺术工作者协会主席、老作家阮洵说：“越南文艺工作者通过中国艺术团所表演的、可以用‘伟大、年轻、快乐’六个字概括起来的节目中，具体学习如何掌握毛泽东主席的文艺思想，并遵循胡志明主席的指示，大力开拓和发展自己民族优秀的文化艺术。”他认为中国艺术团这次访问演出，是越南人民文化艺术史上不可磨灭的一页。著名作家兼历史学者武玉璠说：“越、中两国人民的文化交流虽然很早就已经开始，而且后来一直延续着，但是像这次中国派遣一百七十人的艺术团和越南派遣五十八人的歌舞团，互相访问演出，这还是两国人民历史上最大的一次文化交流活动”。他相信这种直接的、有组织的、大规模的文化交流活动，今后还要增多。这对于进一步巩固越、中两国人民兄弟般的友谊以及促进两国文化艺术的发展，将会有极大的作用。
    越南人民十分热爱中国艺术团，他们把艺术团当作中国人民文化使者和代表。中国艺术团在河内演出期间，有许多青年人静静地骑着自行车围绕艺术团的住所行走，他们和她们非常想看到艺术团的每一个人，但是又害怕把“中国的哥哥和姊姊”们吵醒了。在演出会上，经常可以看到这种情况：有许多人非常想多鼓掌，但是他们和她们又互相督促着少鼓掌，因为怕演员们谢幕和重演的次数多了太累。河内嘉林郡有一位几十年来吃槟榔成瘾的老太太，为了要在献花的时候吻中国艺术团女团员，她宁可一整天不吃槟榔。许多青年工人、农民和学生，互相约定：要以中国艺术团在演出中刻苦、认真、负责的精神作为自己的标榜，加紧工作和努力学习。河内市阮寨中学学生陈维康在给中国艺术团的信里说，他保证努力学习，好为祖国为人民服务；奠边中等专科学校学生乔辉伦在信里说，为了不辜负“哥哥和姊姊们”高度的国际主义精神，他决心要坚决响应胡主席爱祖国、爱劳动、爱学习、爱科学、爱道德的“五爱”号召。越南的青年们像对自己最亲近的人一样，向中国艺术团提出保证或宣誓。河内青年、妇女、老人、儿童一遇见了中国艺术团人员，总是忘不了要请他们代向毛伯伯和中国人民问好。
    中国艺术团现在非常幸福地生活在越南人民的热爱之中，他们互相勉励，决心继续把访问演出工作做好，并虚心学习越南人民优秀的文化艺术，以回答越南人民的热爱和关怀，并完成祖国人民的托付，为中、越两国人民的友谊和繁荣而努力。
