    Trial Run of China's Third Domestically Produced 6,000 kW Steam Turbine

    On the morning of the 15th, China's third domestically produced 6,000 kW steam turbine underwent a trial run at the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, with good results. The factory's employees completed this task three months ahead of schedule. With the exception of some auxiliary machines and accessories, the factory has also completed the state-assigned task of producing three 6,000 kW steam turbines this year, ahead of schedule.

    In early September, when celebrating the early completion of the second steam turbine, the factory's employees proposed to complete the trial run of the third steam turbine by mid-September to welcome National Day. At that time, the time was very tight. All 205 groups in the factory set out practical and specific guarantee conditions, pushing the labor competition to a new high. The workers in the assembly workshop, responsible for the final assembly of the third steam turbine, re-arranged the daily final assembly schedule and managed to solve the three key problems in the final assembly.

    Czechoslovakian State Medal winner, installation expert Yerma She, and inspection expert Xu Naide also put forward ten competition guarantee conditions during the steam turbine manufacturing process, and participated in the factory's labor competition. Yerma She went to the workshop almost every day to help workers accelerate the final assembly of the third steam turbine. At the most critical time, this expert, who came from a working-class background, also crawled into the cylinder for inspection. In the nearly half a year that Yerma She has been at the factory, he has put forward more than 200 relatively important suggestions.

    The employees of the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory are now working hard to realize the plan to increase production by two 6,000 kW steam turbines this year. The factory's trial production of China's first 2,500 kW steam turbine is also underway.

    我国自制的第三台六千瓩汽轮机试车
    十五日上午，我国自制的第三台六千瓩汽轮机在上海汽轮机厂试车，情况良好。汽轮机厂的职工们提前三个月完成了这项任务。除部分辅机和附件以外，国家规定这个厂在今年生产三台六千瓩汽轮机的任务，也已经提前完成。
    九月初，这个厂的职工们在庆祝第二台汽轮机提前制成的时候，提出要在九月中旬完成第三台汽轮机的试车以迎接国庆节。当时时间是很紧迫的。全厂二百零五个小组都订出了切实具体的保证条件，把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨。负责总装第三台汽轮机的装配车间的职工们，重新安排了每天总装的进度计划，并设法解决了总装中的三大关键问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克国家勋章得奖人、安装专家叶尔玛舍、检验专家许乃德在汽轮机制造过程中，也提出十项竞赛保证条件，参加了厂里的劳动竞赛。叶尔玛舍几乎每天都到车间里去，帮助工人加速进行第三台汽轮机的总装工作。在最紧张的时候，这位工人出身的专家也钻进汽缸，进行检查。叶尔玛舍到厂近半年中，就提出了二百多条比较重要的建议。
    上海汽轮机厂职工现在正在努力实现今年增产两台六千瓩汽轮机的计划。这个工厂试制我国第一台二千五百瓩汽轮机的工作，也正在进行中。
