Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today is the glorious 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend warm congratulations to the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    In the ten years since the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the glorious Vietnamese people have waged arduous and heroic struggles against the war of aggression launched by the colonialists, inflicting heavy blows on the aggressors, and thus winning the great victory of the Geneva Conference. After the ceasefire in Indochina, the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam faithfully fulfilled the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina and the realization of Vietnamese unification through national elections, resolutely fighting for peace, unification, independence, and democracy, and actively dedicating themselves to promoting and safeguarding the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    At the same time, the Vietnamese people have very effectively carried out the task of healing the wounds of war and restoring the national economy, and are currently engaged in selfless labor for the further development of the national economy. We believe that under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve new successes in the peaceful construction of their motherland.

    The territory of Vietnam is an indivisible whole, and it is just for the Vietnamese people to demand the unification of their motherland. The Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference stipulated that elections in Vietnam should be held in July 1956, and that representative authorities of both sides should, from July 20, 1955, conduct consultations on this issue. In order to fulfill this provision, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued statements and notes on June 6 and July 19, expressing its readiness to consult with the southern Vietnamese authorities on elections. However, the southern Vietnamese authorities, disregarding the national interests of the Vietnamese people, and supported by external interference, created various excuses to evade the obligations of the Geneva Agreements, and even fabricated the outrageous incident of attacking the residences of the International Commission personnel in order to disrupt the elections. On August 10, the southern Vietnamese authorities openly declared their refusal to consult with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of peaceful unification of Vietnam elections in accordance with the Geneva Agreements, in defiance of the Geneva Agreements. It is quite clear that the occurrence of this situation seriously threatens peace in Indochina. Peace-loving countries and people around the world cannot but express concern about this. We believe that the Vietnamese people's desire to achieve national unification through elections must not be obstructed or sabotaged by anyone. The current situation in Indochina, which is not conducive to peace, must be stopped. The countries concerned at the Geneva Conference have a responsibility to promote the full implementation of the Geneva Agreements. At the same time, we also note that after the ceasefire in Indochina, the situation in Cambodia and Laos is unsatisfactory. The Royal Government of Cambodia and the United States Government signed a military aid agreement on May 16, 1955. In Laos, there is a danger of the same situation occurring. The Royal Government of Laos has recently launched attacks on the Laotian Patriotic Forces with the support of certain foreign forces. These are all contrary to the Geneva Agreements. The Government and people of the People's Republic of China are determined to work to maintain peace in Indochina and fully implement the Geneva Agreements, and to fully support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for peace, unification, independence and democracy.

    The people of China and Vietnam have long enjoyed a deep friendship. After the successive founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the two peoples has become more consolidated and developed. The visit to China in June by the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh marked a new development in the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and a new stage in economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. We firmly believe that the strength generated by this solidarity and cooperation will make a greater contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

    Let us raise our glasses
    To the close friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam,
    To peace in Asia and the world,
    To the health of President Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Vietnamese people!

### 陈云副总理在招待会上的讲话

    陈云副总理在招待会上的讲话敬爱的大使同志、同志们、朋友们：
    今天是越南民主共和国成立十周年的光荣纪念日。我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向越南民主共和国政府和人民致热烈的祝贺。
    越南民主共和国成立十年来，光荣的越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，为了反抗殖民主义者所发动的侵略战争，曾进行了艰苦的英勇的斗争，给予侵略者以严重的打击，从而赢得了日内瓦会议的伟大胜利。印度支那停战后，越南民主共和国政府和人民忠实地履行了日内瓦协议所达成的关于恢复印度支那和平和通过全国选举实现越南统一的各项协议，坚决地为争取和平、统一、独立和民主而斗争，并积极地致力于促进和保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业。
    与此同时，越南人民很有成效地进行了医治战争创伤，恢复国民经济的事业，而目前正在为进一步发展国民经济而进行忘我的劳动。我们相信，越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，必将在祖国的和平建设事业中获得新的成就。
    越南的领土是不可分割的整体，越南人民要求祖国统一的愿望是正义的。日内瓦会议最后宣言规定，越南的选举应在一九五六年七月内举行，双方有代表性的当局应自一九五五年七月二十日起，就这项问题进行协商。越南民主共和国政府为了履行这项规定，曾于六月六日和七月十九日发表声明和照会，表示准备同越南南部当局协商选举。但是，越南南部当局却无视越南人民的民族利益，在外来干涉势力的支持下，制造各种借口规避日内瓦协议的义务，甚至为了破坏选举而制造了袭击国际委员会人员住所的横暴事件。八月十日，越南南部当局竟藐视日内瓦协议，公开声明拒绝按照日内瓦协议同越南民主共和国就和平统一越南的选举问题进行协商。十分明显，这种局势的发生，严重地威胁着印度支那的和平。世界爱好和平的国家和人民，对此不能不表示关心。我们认为，越南人民要求通过选举实现国家统一的愿望，是任何人不得阻挠和破坏的。目前在印度支那所发生的不利于和平的局势必须予以制止。日内瓦会议有关国家有责任促使日内瓦协议得到完全的实施。同时，我们也注意到，印度支那停战后，在柬埔寨和老挝的局势是不能令人满意的。柬埔寨王国政府和美国政府在一九五五年五月十六日签订了军事援助协定。在老挝，同样的情况也有发生的危险。老挝王国政府最近还在某些外国势力支持下向寮国抗战部队进攻。这些都是同日内瓦协议相抵触的。中华人民共和国政府和人民决心为维护印度支那的和平，彻底实施日内瓦协议而努力，并全力支持越南人民争取和平、统一、独立和民主的正义斗争。
    中越人民长久以来就存在着深厚的友谊。越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国相继成立后，两国人民的友谊更加巩固和发展。今年六月以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团的访问中国，标志着中越人民友谊的新发展和两国经济文化合作的新阶段。我们深信，这种团结和合作所产生的力量，将为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出更大的贡献。
    让我们
    为中越两国人民的亲密友谊，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为越南人民的领袖胡志明主席的健康干杯！
