    The British People Fight for Peace
    -- Written for China's "People's Daily"
    Pulitt, Chairman of the British Peace Committee

    In Britain, the struggle for peace is carried out under special conditions. From outside Britain, the achievements of the British peace movement may seem small compared to those of some other countries. If compared with the history of the British workers' movement, especially the establishment of the early British trade union movement and the political struggles of the Chartists, it also seems small. However, I believe that in terms of the achievements already made under the current conditions, it cannot be said to be small. It is essential for all of us to understand the current situation in Britain. Because Britain remains a large and important country; in terms of its imperialist possessions and wealth, as well as its financial and industrial production capacity, it is now far inferior to what it once was, which indeed makes it possible for Britain to become a more powerful country than ever before, referring to the strength of true and pure forces as understood by the new socialist world.

    In Britain, our achievements are limited, and there are many practical difficulties. We cannot but envy and admire the achievements of the People's China and other new countries in the struggle for peace. However, while we are determined to strive for the greatest possible achievements, we must admit that at present we cannot strive for any achievements comparable to those of the People's China and other countries; and I am glad to know that our friends in the more advanced countries already understand our difficulties.

    What is our main trouble? It is actually very simple, that is, in the period after the Second World War, first the Labour government and then the Conservative government have firmly dragged our country into the war camp controlled by the United States. The British people, of course including those engaged in the struggle for peace, are responsible for failing to prevent Britain from being dragged into the war camp. And now the most urgent main task is precisely to urge the British people to realize what has happened and to be determined to remedy it. We are working hard on such a task; we do not have the happiness of the Chinese people, to have a government that truly represents us and moves together in the right direction, but in any case, we know what must be done, we do not shirk the glorious task that should be shouldered, and we are facing it with full spirit.

    In order to understand the situation in our country, to understand how we were dragged into that wrong camp, and to estimate the difficulties we must face in our struggle, I think we must take a look at the people, parties, and government of our capitalist Britain.

    The British people need peace. There is no doubt about this. During the war, Britain was not occupied by enemy forces (although many places were heavily bombed), and millions of British people actively participated in the war, so they deeply knew war and truly loved peace. However, today, in order to strive for lasting peace, simply loving peace is not enough. People must understand the dangers of war and know how to fight it; and, in order to fight effectively, they must know the special dangers of war that affect their own country, so as to carry out effective propaganda against it.

    In this regard, the British people are not as advanced as they should be. Partly because of the cunning propaganda carried out by the British bourgeoisie for more than a century, many British people are not concerned about political issues, thinking that political issues are only matters for politicians, just as they think that cooking is only a matter for cooks. For the same reason, they are easily deceived; when they enjoy superficial prosperity (generally measured by a small unemployment rate), they generally do not criticize and doubt enough what their government does in foreign policy. (But, we will see that the British people are now becoming more and more aware.)

    Now let's take a look at the situation of the British parties that play a role in the British people. In this regard, only two parties are mainly involved, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. The Liberal Party is now a small party with little influence, and it rarely differs from the above two major parties on some important issues of foreign policy. As for the Communist Party of Great Britain, it is excellent, brave, selfless, and wise, but it is small in number; although it can play a very important role in the future, it has little impact in the direct parliamentary political field today. The CPGB does not have any parliamentary seats, and most of the working masses currently maintain a deep, even somewhat blind, obedience to the Labour Party.

    Now, I will talk about the two main parties. The Labour Party, i.e., the Social Democratic Party, won the general election in 1945 by an overwhelming majority; but its right wing controlled the Labour Party's policies, and it soon showed that the Labour Party was taking exactly the same Conservative foreign policy. The Labour government step by step "sold out" Britain to the United States, and allowed the United States to dictate everything in terms of carrying out hostile activities against the socialist camp, rapidly expanding the "Cold War," and allowing a large number of American troops to occupy British territory. Although the Labour Party's left wing and the Communist Party repeatedly issued strong warnings, the general masses who supported the Labour Party tolerated this betrayal of socialist principles for one reason or another. One reason is the lack of concern for foreign policy issues that I mentioned earlier. Another reason, also mentioned earlier, is blind obedience, with many Labour Party supporters saying: "Well, it seems very wrong, but we must trust our Labour government, let's assume it has a reason to do so!" Another reason comes from the atmosphere of so-called Western social democracy—a truly undemocratic atmosphere in which some leaders promote (and followers often accept) the theory that the responsibility of voters is to elect a government and let it formulate and implement policies, while all voters have to do afterward is to accept or support this policy, express their approval or disapproval based on the government's performance, and oppose or re-elect it in the next election four or five years later. Finally, there is another reason, which is caused by the propaganda techniques of the British press and radio, which always use such methods when recommending a policy to voters, trying to prevent voters from objecting or doubting because they have learned the full truth of the event. This method is naturally very effective when the Conservative Party colludes with the Labour government and all newspapers except the Communist Party's few newspapers participate in deceiving and coaxing the public; and the role that the Communist Party's newspapers can play is greatly neutralized by the continuous propaganda offensive jointly conducted by the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, which aims to scare the public and prevent them from having any contact with the Communist Party.

    Regarding the Conservative Party, I don't need to write much; as mentioned earlier, the Conservative Party supported the Labour government's harmful policy of joining the American camp; and when the Conservative Party won the general election in 1951 and came to power, it would of course continue and expand the "Conservative" foreign policy that the Labour government had implemented, including yielding to the United States, and in this regard, the Conservative Party was supported by the Labour Party.

    In this way, it is easy to understand how the financial giants who actually control Britain through these two parties dragged Britain into the current war camp. Now, I will talk about under what conditions the British Peace Committee is fighting for peace.

    At first glance, our task seems very difficult, but neither in the past nor now is it something that anyone has the right to be timid and retreat. However, the difficulties are real. From the beginning, the Labour Party headquarters has "affirmed" that the British Peace Committee is "pro-communist." One of the Conservative-Labour Party's customary methods is to use the "demon" of communism to stop any progressive activities that are not under the control of the Labour Party headquarters. As a result, any Labour Party member who participates in the work of the British Peace Committee will be expelled from the Labour Party, which means being deprived of the opportunity to engage in party political activities and promotion. The Conservative Party also acted as an accomplice, instigating almost all British newspapers to refuse to publish any activities or documents related to the British Peace Committee.

    In this case, what strength does the British Peace Committee have to rely on? This is those who are politically progressive and are outside the Labour Party; those Labour Party members who are determined to defend peace and do not hesitate to risk being expelled; and some Conservatives, Liberals, and non-partisan people who not only love peace but also recognize the dangers of war and the need to actively fight to prevent this danger. Of course, we have also received strong support from Communist Party members.

    These people give us enough strength to carry out a truly effective struggle. In the past few large-scale signature collection campaigns, this strength has played a big role, and they can collect many signatures in vast areas; however, there are also certain "restrictive factors" that prevent us from getting enough signature collectors to work in larger areas. Whenever we can absorb one or two more people to participate in the work in an area, we can open up more streets, and more signatures will be collected. So, in fact, we have enough strength to do a lot of work; of course, if the strength is greater, we can do better.

    I would also like to mention that the British Peace Committee, as a branch of the World Peace Council, is the largest and most broadly based peace organization in Britain, but it is not the only existing peace organization. There are also several other peace groups, which have been established for quite some time, mostly with religious colors, advocating absolute pacifism (i.e., regardless of the cause of the war, or which side is just, they do not participate). These groups have some influence and can get limited but not unimportant support in the middle class. For a long time, the British Peace Committee has been persuading them to cooperate, especially after the Helsinki World Peace Congress in June this year. It can be said that we have achieved success in persuading them to cooperate with us to a certain extent.

    I have talked a lot about the struggle for peace in Britain, and it seems that there are quite a lot of difficulties involved; now I want to talk about the truly commendable achievements we have made in this situation.

    These achievements are manifested in the great increase in the British public's awareness and determination for peace, which is manifested in the formation of a strong public opinion that actively demands the British government to ease international tensions and maintain peace. The reason why this is possible, I think, can be said to be largely due to the work of the British Peace Committee (of course, the most important fact is that achievements have been made). There is no doubt that this is due to the British people's love for peace; however, simply loving peace itself cannot achieve anything. The fact that the British mainland is full of American atomic bombing bases, atomic bombers, and atomic bomb storage facilities, and that densely populated Britain will be in extreme danger once a world war breaks out, undoubtedly has an impact on people; but we have had to make great efforts to make the British public fully aware of it. Similarly, there is no doubt that the British public has a real understanding of the enormous dangers of atomic weapons and the even more destructive hydrogen weapons; but, we have had to make great efforts to awaken the British people to this awareness. (In this regard, we have flexibly used the death of a Japanese fisherman and the serious injury of many people caused by the American testing of hydrogen bombs to carry out propaganda).

    Now, the British public is greatly awakened. The tendency of not asking about politics has changed somewhat; the deception of the British press and government does not achieve its purpose. We British people have now become conscious and active peace warriors, and they have become a much more important factor in world opinion than ever before. This world opinion has demonstrated its great power in stopping two wars in Asia, preventing the use of nuclear weapons in Asia, and forcing some people to cooperate in international conferences one after another against their will to ease international tensions.

    Our greatest achievement is prominently manifested in the British general election held in May this year. The British peace movement has been able to form a public opinion pressure, forcing the British government to assume a more progressive role in these international conferences. The two major parties, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, had conspired to implement a fatal and truly treacherous policy, placing Britain in the war camp (becoming an atomic bombing target in the front line), while trying to campaign on some domestic policies that they claimed to be different, while avoiding the issue of atomic weapons, the issue of great power consultation, and other issues related to peace. But in Western parliamentary democracy, one thing that voters can really do is to force those parties and candidates to face the major issues that voters care about in the general election. In this general election, voters forced them not only to face important domestic issues (which is significant enough), but also to face all aspects of the peace issue. As a result, whether the Conservative Party or the Labour Party, they had to shout for peace and assure the voters that they would work for peace once elected. After the Conservative Party won the general election, it went to Geneva to attend the meeting and truly worked to ease international tensions; public opinion was so clear and strong that no government dared to delay—let alone refuse—to fulfill its promises.

    This is why I said that the British peace movement has made great achievements. In fact, the British peace movement this time shouldered the task of the opposition party that the Labour Party had abandoned, put forward the black and white questions, and made it get a ruling in the general election.

    So, we have achievements; but it is far from enough. We must more actively strive for greater achievements on the existing basis. In this regard, with the increasingly vigorous industrial workers fighting side by side with us, we will be able to change the Labour Party's policies. Achieving this will not only be able to achieve lasting peace, but also change the entire face of Britain and Western Europe, so that we can get a complete victory, and then we will be able to proudly report to the Chinese comrades who have made so many proud achievements.

    英国人民为争取和平而斗争
    ——为中国“人民日报”而作
    英国和平委员会主席　普里特
    在英国，争取和平的斗争是在特殊的条件下进行的。从英国国外来看，英国和平运动的成就同其他某些国家相比似乎是微小的。如果同英国工人运动的历史，特别是同英国早期工会运动的创立情况和宪章运动者的政治斗争来比较，似乎也是微小的。但是，我认为，就在目前条件下已经取得的成就而论，不能说它是微小的。对我们大家来说，认识一下今天的英国局势是十分必要的。因为英国仍然是一个大而重要的国家；就英国的帝国主义占有和财富以及它的财政和工业生产能力来说，现在是大不如前了，这种情况的确使英国有可能成为比以往任何时期更为强大的国家，这里指的是为新的社会主义世界所了解的真正纯洁的力量的强大。
    在英国，我们的成就有限，实际困难也不少，我们不能不羡慕和敬佩人民中国和其他新的国家在争取和平的斗争中所取得的成就。然而，当我们决心致力争取可能的最大的成就的时候，我们必须承认，在目前我们还不能够争取到能同人民中国和其他国家相比拟的任何成就；并且我很高兴地知道，我们那些在比较先进的国家里的朋友们已经明白我们的困难。
    我们主要的麻烦是什么呢？实际上很简单，就是在第二次世界大战以后的时期中，先是工党政府后来是保守党政府把我们的国家牢牢地拖入由美国控制的战争阵营里。英国人民，当然也包括在进行争取和平斗争的人们，是要对没有阻止住英国被拖入战争阵营这件事负责的。而现在最迫切的主要任务正是促使英国人民认识到已经发生的事情，并下定决心补救它。我们正努力从事这样一项任务；我们没有像中国人民那样的幸福，能够有一个真正代表我们的政府一起朝着正确的方向前进，但是，无论如何我们知道必须作什么，我们不逃避应该担负的光荣任务，我们正在精神饱满地面对着它。
    为了了解我们国家的局势，了解我们怎会被拖入那个错误的阵营，并且估计一下在我们的斗争中必须面对的困难，我认为，我们一定要看一下我们资本主义英国的人民、政党和政府。
    英国人民需要和平。这是没有可以怀疑的。在战争时期，英国没有被敌军占领过（虽然许多地方曾遭到猛烈的轰炸），千百万英国人民曾积极地参加了战争，因此他们是深深知道战争而真正热爱和平的。但是，今天为了争取巩固的和平，单单爱和平是不够的。人们必须明白战争的危险，并懂得如何跟它进行斗争；而且，为了有效地进行斗争，必须知道那种影响到自己祖国的战争的特别危险，以便于进行有效的宣传来反对它。
    在这一方面，英国人民却不像他们应有的那样先进。部分原因是由于一个多世纪以来英国资产阶级所进行的狡猾宣传，使得不少英国人不关心政治问题，认为政治问题只是政治家的事，正像他们认为做饭只是厨子的事一样。由于同样的原因，他们容易地受了骗；当他们享受着表面繁荣（一般是以失业比率小来衡量的）的时候，他们对于他们的政府在外交政策方面干的事，一般批评和怀疑得不够。（但是，我们就会看到，英国人民现在已经越来越变得更为觉醒了。）
    现在我们来看一下对英国人民起着作用的英国政党的情况。在这一方面，主要只涉及两个政党，工党和保守党。自由党现在是个小党派，几乎没有什么影响，在外交政策方面的一些重要问题上也很少同上述两个大党有什么不同。至于英国共产党，它是优秀的、勇敢的、有牺牲精神和有智慧的，但是它的人数不多；虽然在将来能起十分重要的作用，在今天直接的议会政治领域中影响不大。英共没有议会席位，而且大多数劳动群众目前还对工党保持着一种很深的，甚至有点盲目的顺从态度。
    现在，我来谈一下那两个主要政党。工党，即社会民主党，以绝大多数赢得了一九四五年的大选；但是它的右翼控制了工党的政策，并且不久就表明，工党采取的正是一成不变的保守党的外交政策。工党政府一步一步地把英国“出卖”给美国，在对社会主义阵营进行敌对活动、迅速扩展“冷战”、让大量美军占驻英国国土等方面都听任美国摆布。虽然工党左翼和共产党一再提出强烈警告，支持工党的一般群众却因为这种或那种理由容忍了这种背弃社会主义原则的行为。其中一个理由就是我前面已经提到的对外交政策问题不大关心。另外一个理由，前面也已提到，是盲从，很多的工党支持者说：“唔，看来很不对头，但是我们必须信任我们的工党政府，让我们假定它有理由这样干吧！”还有一个理由，是出自所谓西方的社会民主主义的气氛——一种真正不民主的气氛，在这种气氛中，一些领导者提倡（而信徒们也常常接受）这样的理论：对于选民的责任就是选出一个政府，让它制定和推行政策，而选民以后所要做的就只是接受或则支持这种政策，根据这个政府的政绩对它表示赞成或则不赞成，而在四年或五年后的下次选举中反对或则重选它。最后，还有一个理由，它是由英国报刊和广播的宣传技巧造成的，它们向选民们推荐一项政策时，总是使用这样一套手法，极力防止选民们会因为获悉事件全部真象时而提出反对或怀疑。在保守党同工党政府沆瀣一气而且除了共产党的少数报刊之外所有报刊都参与了欺瞒和哄骗公众的勾当的情况下，这种办法自然是很能起作用的；而共产党报刊所能起的作用，则又大大地被保守党和工党联合进行的连续不断的宣传攻势所中和，这种宣传旨在恐吓公众，使他们不同共产党发生任何联系。
    关于保守党，我不需要写很多；如前所述，保守党支持了工党政府的参加美国阵营的有害政策；而当一九五一年保守党在大选中获胜上台后，它当然要继续并且扩大实行工党政府曾经实行的“保守党”的外交政策，包括屈从美国，在这一方面，保守党又得到了工党的支持。
    这样就容易明白：通过这两个政党实际控制着英国的财政巨头是怎样把英国拖进目前的战争阵营的。现在，我来谈一下英国和平委员会是在怎样的条件下为争取和平而斗争的。
    乍一看，我们的任务似乎是很艰难的，但是，无论是过去或现在，都不是任何人有权利胆怯不前的事情。不过，困难是实际存在的。从一开始，工党总部就“确言”英国和平委员会是“亲共的”。保守党—工党惯用的手法之一，就是利用共产主义的“妖魔”来阻止任何不在工党总部控制之下的进步活动，这样一来，任何工党党员一旦参与英国和平委员会的工作，就将被工党开除，也就是被剥夺了政党政治活动和升迁的机会。而保守党也充当帮凶，唆使几乎全部的英国报刊拒绝刊登有关英国和平委员会的任何活动或文件。
    在这种情况下，英国和平委员会可资凭借的力量是什么呢？这就是那些政治上进步而身在工党以外的人；那些坚决保卫和平而不惜冒被开除危险的工党党员们；还有一些保守党人、自由党人和无党无派人士，他们不仅热爱和平而且认识到战争的危险和积极斗争防止这种危险的必要。当然，我们，还得到了共产党党员的大力帮助。
    这些人就使得我们有足够的力量去进行真正有成效的斗争。在过去几次大规模征集签名的运动中，这种力量就起了很大作用，他们在广大地区中人人都能征集到不少的签名；不过，也还存在着一定的“限制性因素”，使我们不能够得到足够的签名征集者在更为广大的地区中进行工作。无论任何时候，只要我们能在一个地区多吸收一两个人参加工作，我们就可以多开辟一些街道，签名也就会征集得多一些。所以，实际上，我们有作很多工作的足够的力量；当然，如果力量再大些，就能做得更好些。
    我还要提到，作为世界和平理事会分支机构的英国和平委员会，是英国最大的和具有广泛群众基础的和平组织，然而它不是现有的唯一的和平组织。还有其他几个和平团体，它们建立已有相当时间，大多有宗教色彩，主张绝对的和平主义（即：不管战争起因如何，正义在哪一边，都不参加）。这些团体都有一些影响，在中产阶层中能够得到有限的然而并非不重要的支持。长时期以来，英国和平委员会曾劝说它们实行合作，特别在今年六月赫尔辛基世界和平大会以后，可以说，我们在说服它们在一定范围内同我们进行合作的问题上已经获得了成就。
    我已经谈了不少关于在英国进行争取和平斗争的情况，涉及困难的一方面似乎相当多了；现在我要谈一谈我们在这种情况下我们所取得的的确是值得称赞的成就。
    这些成就表现在英国的广大公众对和平的认识和决心已经有了很大的增进，这就是表现在积极要求英国政府和缓国际紧张局势和维护和平的强大公众舆论的形成上。所以能够这样，我认为，可以说，很大程度是由于英国和平委员会的工作（当然最重要的事实是已经取得了成就）。毫无疑问，这得力于英国人民对和平的热爱；不过单是对和平的热爱本身是不可能有什么成就的。在英国本土上遍布着美国的原子轰炸基地、原子轰炸机和原子弹储存所，一旦世界战争爆发，人口密集的英国将处于万分危险境地，这种现实无疑是对人们有影响的；但是我们曾经需要费很大劲去使英国公众充分认识它。同样毫无疑问，英国公众已经对于原子武器以及破坏力更大的氢武器的巨大危害性具有真实的认识；但是，我们曾经需要费很大劲去促醒英国人民有此觉悟。（在这方面，我们曾灵活地利用了美国试验氢弹所造成的一个日本渔民的死亡和许多人的严重伤害进行宣传）。
    现在，英国公众是大大觉醒了。不问政治的倾向已经有所转变；英国报刊和政府的欺骗达不到目的。我们英国人民现在已经成为自觉的和积极的和平战士，他们已成为世界舆论中比过去任何时候都重大得多的因素，这种世界舆论曾经在停止亚洲的两个战争、制止在亚洲使用核子武器和迫使某些人违反本意地参加一个又一个国际会议合作和缓国际紧张局势等方面表明了它的巨大力量。
    我们最大的成就突出地表现在今年五月举行的英国大选中。英国的和平运动已能够形成一种舆论压力，迫使英国政府在这些国际会议中担负起比较前进一些的角色。保守党和工党这两大政党曾经共谋执行一种致命的、真正背叛国家的政策，把英国置于战争阵营（在前沿成为原子轰炸目标），同时却极力想在一些它们自称主张不同的对内政策上进行竞选，而把原子武器问题、大国协商问题以及其他有关和平的问题避而不谈。但是在西方议会民主中，选民们有一点可以真正做到的是在大选中迫使那些政党和候选人面对选民们关心的重大问题。在这次大选中，选民们就迫使他们不仅面对重要的国内问题（关于这一方面是有足够的意义的），而且面对和平问题的各个方面。结果，无论是保守党或工党，都不得不高喊和平，并向选民们保证，一旦当选必将致力和平。保守党在大选中获胜后就到日内瓦去开会，而且真正为缓和国际紧张局势作了工作；公众舆论是如此明确和强大，以至没有一个政府敢于拖延——更不要说拒绝——履行它的诺言。
    这就是为什么我说英国和平运动取得了伟大成就的原故。事实上，英国和平运动这次担负起工党所放弃了的反对派政党应该负起的任务，把黑白分明的问题摆出来，并在大选中使它得到一个裁决。
    所以，我们是有成就的；不过还大大不够。我们必须更加积极地在现有基础上争取更大的成就。在这一方面，有着斗争精神日益旺盛的产业工人同我们并肩战斗，我们将能改变工党的政策。作到这一点便不仅仅能够取得巩固的和平，而且还会改变英国和西欧的整个面貌，使我们得到全盘的胜利，那时我们将能自豪地向已经取得如此之多可以骄傲的成就的中国同志们有所报告了。
