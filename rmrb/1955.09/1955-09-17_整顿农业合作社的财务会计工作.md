    Rectify the Financial Accounting Work of Agricultural Cooperatives

    The autumn harvest season is approaching, and hundreds of thousands of agricultural cooperatives are about to distribute the fruits of their labor. The crops of the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have grown well again this year, which is another victory for the agricultural collectivization movement.

    Among the existing more than 600,000 cooperatives, more than 500,000 were established last winter and this spring. They will conduct their first distribution this autumn. The members are most concerned about the distribution. They are constantly calculating: What benefits can they get from the cooperative? Can the distribution be clear and reasonable? Many members judge the achievements of agricultural cooperatives not only based on the goodness of production, but also based on the goodness of the distribution work and the amount of their own income. Many farmers outside the cooperative also decide whether to join the cooperative based on the production and distribution of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, doing a good job in the autumn harvest distribution of hundreds of thousands of agricultural cooperatives, especially new cooperatives, is of great significance for consolidating existing cooperatives and developing new cooperatives this autumn and winter.

    Whether the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural cooperatives can be done well depends on whether it can correctly implement the policy of mutual benefit, and also depends on the quality of its financial management and whether its accounting books are clear. In order to help agricultural cooperatives do a good job in the autumn harvest distribution, we must first help them rectify their financial accounting work.

    During the last winter and this spring, the Party and government leading organs in various places helped the newly established cooperatives train more than 500,000 accountants and equipped a group of financial accounting instructors to provide them with regular guidance; most of the new cooperatives have been equipped with accountants, and the necessary account books have been established; the accounts of more than half of the new cooperatives are basically clear. However, there are still many problems in the financial accounting work of a considerable number of new cooperatives, which are mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, about 20% to 30% of the new cooperatives have unqualified accountants, and the accounts they manage often go wrong. The members of the Xianjin Third Cooperative in Changge County, Henan Province, have the following reflection: "The accountant keeps a confused account, the labor earns a confused share, and we eat a confused meal." Second, some new cooperatives in some culturally backward areas have not yet been equipped with accountants. Forty-three of the 506 cooperatives in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, do not have accountants. Third, the composition of some accountants is impure, and the problems of some people are still very serious. According to statistics from three counties in Liaoning Province, such as Zhuanghe and Xiuyan, about 4% to 5% of the accountants have impure composition. Some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries took advantage of the weakness of farmers' cultural backwardness, mixed into the cooperatives, stole accounting positions, and took the opportunity to carry out various sabotage activities. These problems must be solved in a timely manner, otherwise the autumn harvest distribution of some new cooperatives will inevitably lead to serious confusion, and even cause great harm to the cooperativization cause in these areas.

    We must also see that even most of the new cooperatives equipped with better accountants will still have problems in this year's autumn harvest distribution. When various places opened accounting training courses last winter and this spring, most of them only taught bookkeeping methods, and had not yet had time to teach distribution settlement methods; some accountants, although they had studied distribution settlement, did not learn deeply or thoroughly, and it is still inevitable that some errors will occur in actual application.

    At present, the rectification of the financial accounting work of agricultural cooperatives should be taken as a necessary measure to consolidate the existing new cooperatives and prepare for large-scale cooperative construction this autumn and winter, taking the county as a unit. First of all, we should help the new cooperatives with unclear accounts to clear up their accounts. This requires planned efforts to transfer a group of people familiar with accounting work from banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments, to cooperate with cooperative staff and financial accounting instructors to conduct a general inspection of the accounts of each cooperative in order to find out the situation, classify them into different types, and help organize them. For those cooperatives whose accounts are somewhat disordered but not a major problem, the mutual teaching and learning method can be used through accounting mutual aid organizations to sort out all the accounts and improve the level of accountants in the process of sorting out the accounts. For those cooperatives whose accounts are seriously disordered, efforts should be concentrated on providing key guidance and helping to sort them out one by one. For the few cooperatives that have not yet established formal account books, specific assistance should be given to clear up the past income and expenditure accounts and start establishing formal account books. For cooperatives that are not easy to thoroughly clear up their accounts for a while, members and cadres should be mobilized to check together, and strive to first clarify the internal and external transactions and labor day accounts of the cooperative. In the work of sorting out the accounts, we should combine the rectification of accounting mutual aid groups to gradually improve them and give full play to their role. Secondly, we must do a good job in retraining accountants. All accountants who have not studied or have not learned the distribution settlement, and some recently replaced accountants, must seize the time to retrain them. The training content mainly includes distribution policies and distribution settlement methods. Accountants with very low accounting skills should also be retrained in bookkeeping methods and methods of sorting out messy accounts. In addition, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who have mixed into the cooperatives and stolen accounting positions must be resolutely cleaned up. Any thoughts of carelessness, complacency, and tolerance will cause great harm to agricultural cooperatives, which must not be taken lightly.

    Some rural staff, and even some leaders, still do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of rectifying the financial accounting work of agricultural cooperatives. They believe that rectifying the accounting work of the cooperative is only a technical issue, and it can be done by a few financial accounting instructors; the leaders are very busy now and cannot spend energy on this aspect. In fact, such a heavy task as rectifying financial accounting cannot be done well by a few instructors alone. This is not only because many financial accounting instructors are still novices and lack work experience; but also because this work is not just a technical problem of bookkeeping, it is related to the specific implementation of the cooperative's mutual benefit policy, including a series of organizational work and ideological education work, and it is impossible to do it well without the leadership, assistance, and timely supervision and inspection of the leading organs.

    Some comrades believe that some old cooperatives also had shortcomings in financial accounting last year, but they finally distributed the grain. Therefore, the grain of these new cooperatives this year will naturally be distributed, and there will be no major problems. This kind of blind optimism is very harmful. Some old cooperatives seriously affected the enthusiasm of the members due to unclear accounts and unreasonable distribution last year; some cooperatives even disintegrated as a result. The Shijiashan Agricultural Cooperative in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, did not do a good job in accounting last year, and the members were dissatisfied, and the result was that the cooperative collapsed. If the accounting work is not done well, the distribution will inevitably be chaotic, and the consolidation of the cooperative will inevitably be affected. Therefore, it must be rectified in a practical way.

    In order to help the existing agricultural cooperatives to rectify their financial accounting work, manpower and time must be properly arranged. In areas where the retraining work has ended, efforts should be concentrated on helping the cooperatives to clear up their accounts, prepare autumn harvest distribution plans, and clean up accountants with impure composition. In areas where the work of sorting out the accounts has already begun but the accountants have not yet been retrained, a certain amount of time should be spent as soon as possible to retrain the accountants, taking the county or district as a unit. After the retraining work is completed, the work of sorting out the accounts and helping to formulate autumn harvest distribution plans should be continued immediately. Areas where none of these tasks have yet begun should move quickly. The autumn harvest season has already arrived in some places, and the autumn harvest will be coming soon in some places. Time is tight and the task is heavy. The leading organs in various places must strengthen their specific leadership over this work in order to promote the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives.

### 整顿农业合作社的财务会计工作

    整顿农业合作社的财务会计工作
    秋收季节快到了，几十万个农业合作社就要进行劳动果实的分配。绝大多数农业合作社的庄稼今年又都长得好，这是农业合作化运动的又一次胜利。
    现有的六十多万个社里头，有五十多万个是去冬今春成立的。它们要在今年秋季进行首次分配。社员们对于分配最关心，他们时时刻刻盘算着：究竟能从合作社里得到些什么好处？分配能不能做到清楚合理？许多社员不仅根据生产的好坏，还根据分配工作的好坏，自己收入的多少，来判断农业合作社的成绩。许多社外农民也是根据农业合作社的生产和分配的情况，决定自己是否参加社。因此，作好几十万个农业合作社、特别是新社的秋收分配工作，对于巩固现有的社和在今年秋冬发展新社，都有极为重大的意义。
    农业合作社的秋收分配能否作好，决定于它对互利政策是否能够正确执行，也决定于它的财务管理工作的好坏和它的会计账目是否清楚。为了帮助农业合作社作好秋收分配，首先必须帮助它们整顿财务会计工作。
    各地党政领导机关在去冬今春帮助新建立的合作社训练了五十多万名会计员，并且配备了一批财务会计辅导员对它们进行经常的辅导工作；绝大多数新社的会计员已经配齐，必要的账簿已经建立；半数以上的新社的账目基本上是清楚的。但是，相当数量的新社的财务会计工作中仍然有许多问题，主要表现在以下几个方面：第一、约有百分之二十至三十的新社的会计员不称职，他们经管的账目常常发生错乱。河南长葛县先进三社的社员就有这样的反映：“会计管的糊涂账，劳动挣的糊涂分，我们吃的糊涂饭。”第二、某些文化比较落后地区的部分新社，现在还没有配备会计员。陕西米脂县五百零六个社中的四十三个社就没有会计员。第三、部分会计员成分不纯，有些人的问题还很严重。据辽宁省庄河、岫岩等三个县统计，约有百分之四至五的会计员成分不纯。有些地主、富农和反革命分子利用农民文化落后的弱点，混入社内，窃取会计职位，乘机进行种种破坏活动。以上这些问题必须及时加以解决，否则部分新社的秋收分配必然发生严重的混乱现象，以至给这些地区的合作化事业造成很大的危害。
    我们还要看到，就是大部分配备有较好的会计员的新社，在今年的秋收分配中也不是没有问题了。去冬今春各地开办会计训练班的时候，多数仅仅教授了记账方法，还没有来得及教授分配结算方法；有一部分会计员虽然学过分配结算，但学的不深不透，实际运用起来，还难免会发生某些差错。
    目前应该以县为单位，把整顿农业合作社的财务会计工作，作为巩固现有的新社和准备在今年秋冬大规模建社的一项必要措施。首先，应该帮助账目不清的新社整清账目。这就要有计划地从银行、供销合作社和其他部门，抽调一批熟悉会计工作的人员，配合办社工作人员和财务会计辅导员，对各社的账目作一次普遍检查，以便摸清情况，分别不同类型，帮助整理。对那些账目有些错乱但问题不大的社，可通过会计互助组织，用互教互学的方法，把全部账目整理清楚，并在整理账目的过程中提高会计员的水平。对那些账目错乱比较严重的社，要集中力量进行重点辅导，逐个帮助整理清楚。对少数还没有建立正式账簿的社，要具体帮助清理已往的收支账目，并着手建立正式账簿。对一时不易彻底查清账目的社，要发动社员和干部共同查对，争取首先弄清社内社外往来存欠账目和劳动日账目。在整理账目的工作中，要结合整顿会计互助小组，使它们逐步健全起来，充分发挥作用。其次，要作好补训会计员的工作。凡是没有学过或没有学会分配结算的会计员，和某些新近更换的会计员，都要抓紧时间加以补训。训练内容主要是分配政策和分配结账方法。对会计业务能力很低的会计员，还应当补训记账方法和整理乱账的方法。还有，对于混入社内窃取会计职位的地主、富农和反革命分子，必须坚决加以清洗。任何麻痹大意、迁就姑息的思想，都会使农业合作社遭受重大的危害，这是万万不能马虎的。
    有些农村工作人员，甚至某些领导人员，现在还对整顿农业合作社的财务会计工作的重要性认识不足。他们认为整顿社的会计工作仅仅是个技术性的问题，交给几个财务会计辅导员去作就行了；现在领导人员很忙，不能花费精力在这一方面。其实，像整顿财务会计这样繁重的工作，单靠几个辅导员是作不好的。这不但因为很多财务会计辅导员还是新手，缺乏工作经验；而且由于这项工作并不单单是个记账的技术问题，它关系到社的互利政策的具体贯彻，包括着一系列的组织工作和思想教育工作，如果没有领导机关的领导、帮助和及时地进行督促检查，是不可能做好的。
    有些同志认为，有些老社去年在财务会计方面也有缺点，但最后还是把粮食分配下去了，因此，今年这些新社的粮食自然而然也要分配下去，不会出大的乱子。这种盲目乐观的想法非常有害。有些老社去年由于账目不清，分配不合理，严重地影响了社员的积极性；有些社甚至因此解体。陕西米脂县石家山农业合作社，去年没有把会计工作做好，社员不满意，结果社就垮了。会计工作做不好，分配一定发生混乱，社的巩固必然受到影响。所以必须切实加以整顿。
    为了帮助现有的农业合作社把财务会计工作整顿好，必须把人力和时间加以妥善的安排。目前补训工作已经结束的地区，要集中力量帮助各社整清账目，编制秋收分配方案和清洗成分不纯的会计员。已经开始整理账目但尚未补训会计员的地区，应当尽快抽出一定的时间，以县或区为单位补训会计员。补训工作结束后，即应继续整理账目和帮助制定秋收分配方案。这些工作还都没有开始的地区，要赶快动作起来。有的地方秋收季节已经到来，有的地方也快要秋收了，时间很紧，任务很重，各地领导机关必须加强对这一工作的具体领导，以促进农业合作社的巩固和发展。
