Dedicate Our Youth to Socialism
Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League

In a few days, the National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction will open in the capital of our motherland. This is a major event in the lives of young people across the country, and it is also a major event that the people of the whole country are concerned about. More than 1,500 of the most outstanding young activists, representing the millions of young builders on all fronts across the country, will gather in Beijing to report their achievements to the motherland and share their experiences; to receive instructions from the Party Central Committee and listen to the reports of the Central Committee of the Youth League; to discuss the tasks of young people in realizing the Five-Year Plan, and to propose their own plans for future efforts. This will surely set off a new upsurge among young people across the country to make contributions to socialist construction.

Young people across the country warmly support this congress for advancing towards socialism. Young people in various places are dedicating their practical actions to the congress. For example: Zhang Baifa, Hu Yaolin, Feng Bensen, Yu Chunhe and other four youth shock brigades in Beijing initiated a campaign to overfulfill their tasks by 20% in September and reduce raw material consumption to below 2% of administrative regulations; youth workers on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway decided to advance the track laying to Zhangye; Li Shou'an, a young worker from a factory in Harbin, proposed an initiative to save steel, and guaranteed to save another 24 tons of steel for the country from September to December; young people in rural Henan launched a movement to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer with thousands of vehicles and ten thousand loads; Sun Xianzong, director of the Renhe Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hailun County, Heilongjiang, initiated a movement to increase grain production by 50 jin per hectare in the autumn harvest, and to increase the country's grain harvest by 400 million jin in the autumn harvest throughout the province; 130,000 young people in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei, participated in artificial pollination of corn, planning to increase production by more than 5.83 million jin of grain; young members of the Central Experimental Opera House actively launched creative activities and created eleven songs for the congress. These facts prove that the National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction has now become a symbol of the upcoming new upsurge of young people across the country to make contributions to socialist construction.

Making contributions to socialist construction is the happiness of our generation of young people. Only in the era of Mao Zedong, when the working people have become masters of their own affairs and the construction of socialism has become a reality, can we personally engage in such a glorious and great cause. History has given us this supreme happiness, allowing us to dedicate our precious youth to socialism.

Making contributions to socialist construction is also the glorious responsibility of our generation of young people. Because building socialism is an arduous and difficult historical task, it requires people to persevere in their struggles and to make great efforts. And there are more than 120 million young people in our country, who are energetic and brave to move forward, so young people should become a huge shock force in building socialism. The Party and the state have put forward the following requirements to the young people: to dedicate the strength of their youth to socialism without reservation.

The facts of the past few years show that the young people of our country understand their happiness and have fulfilled their responsibilities. They have actively participated in various struggles of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and have demonstrated a spirit of heroism and tenacity in the struggles, proving that they are not empty talkers who praise socialism, but warriors who contribute their strength to socialism in a down-to-earth manner. However, young comrades, we are people who are never satisfied with past achievements, and we are people who always want to look forward and move forward. The first Five-Year Plan personally formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has been officially announced. Young people across the country must more bravely participate in various struggles of socialist construction and socialist transformation, do our work better, and greatly promote the cause of the motherland.

It should be pointed out that in our country, young people in any job position have the opportunity to create achievements and contribute their talents to socialist construction. Because building a socialist society in our country is to gradually make all aspects of our country's politics, economy, culture, and defense fully conform to the advanced standards of socialism. Our front is very broad. Every job is an indispensable aspect of the struggle to build a socialist society, and it is a very glorious and promising job, and there are great opportunities to display one's talents. In fact, young people in our country have already made important contributions in different job positions and on different fronts of socialist construction. This can be proved by the youth representatives who will participate in the National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction. We can see Zhu Weiqin, a young lathe operator from the Dalian Shipyard in Dalian, who completed four years of production quota in two and a half years, and Wen Xianglan, a young cooperative director from the Central Plains of our country, who has always adhered to the path of cooperation and overcame various difficulties to expand the cooperative from seven households to ninety-two households. At the same time, we can also see Jin Zhendu, a model doctor from the remote areas of our country, who fought against diseases in the uninhabited primeval forest for thousands of miles and achieved excellent results. We can see Bai Wenchang, a combat hero from the forefront of the national defense of our country, who created an example of the coordination between the army and the navy in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island. At the same time, we can also see Wu Deyuan, an ordinary young engraving worker from the rear front who defended the motherland, who has reported 281 counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders in the past five years. We can see Hu Zhaosen, a labor model from Anshan Iron and Steel, who has received higher education and mastered advanced science and technology under the earnest teachings of Soviet experts, and has therefore made creations in his work. At the same time, we can also see Zhao Zhipei, a young man from the North China Agricultural Research Institute, who originally only had a primary school education, but has now become a scientific worker through hard self-study and active participation in practical work. We can not only see countless heroes in the struggle against the enemy and labor models in industry and agriculture, but also many model workers from those job positions that are considered ordinary. Here is Xu Mengzhi, a salesperson from the Linglongta District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jianchang County, Rehe Province. She has a deep understanding of the needs of the masses and sells goods according to the needs of the farmers, becoming an advanced worker in the national cooperative system; there is Hua Yinfeng, a breeder from the Dongyang County Farm in Zhejiang Province. She has created a set of scientific pig-feeding methods in her work. In the past, two people could manage 71 pigs, but she can now be responsible for the feeding of 96 pigs; there is Yang Xiyin, a teacher from the Zhongtan Village Private School in the 16th District of Linyi County, Shandong Province. He has created a unit-based复式teaching method in his teaching work, which makes it possible to complete the courses that require two winters and one full year of study to achieve the goal of literacy without leaving production, and can be completed in only six months. Do these living examples not illustrate that our great socialist construction cause has opened up infinitely broad development prospects for young people? It can be seen that the different nature of work, the different work areas, the different levels of education, and the different front and rear lines cannot limit the development of young people at all. All roads lead to socialism, and every job position is a place for socialist warriors to use their talents. Therefore, young people in all walks of life should bravely devote themselves to the actual struggle with full confidence and strive to become active members of socialist construction in the near future.

This is the hope of the Party and the state for all young people, and it is also the ambition that every young person should have.

To become an active member of socialist construction and dedicate your youth to socialism, the first thing is to work diligently. Creation and invention are of course valuable, because if everyone can be like Wang Chonglun, who completes four years of work in one year, we can greatly accelerate the pace of our country's socialist construction. But this does not mean that only those who have made inventions and creations in their work are active members of socialist construction. Comrades, no, it is not. To be an active member of socialist construction, there are many ways for you to contribute your strength. If we can be a good member in the youth shock brigade, a good member in the youth conservation team, a good member in the agricultural production cooperative, promote advanced farming techniques in the countryside, actively participate in the accumulation of fertilizer, and actively participate in reclamation and afforestation, these are all manifestations of active participation in socialist construction, and they are all active members of socialist construction. Wang Hengcheng, a worker at the Benxi Coal Mine, has not been absent from work in six years, and has not had an accident in five years; Qi Changyuan, a lathe operator at the Dalian Cement Plant, has not been absent from work in eight and a half years, has not violated labor discipline once, has not produced a defective product in seven and a half years, and has not lost or damaged a tool. Although they have not made any inventions or creations, they have always worked sincerely, which has also made them active members of socialist construction and will gloriously participate in the National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction. Therefore, the important issue lies in earnestly taking on one's own responsibility and working honestly.

To be an active member of socialist construction, one must also strive to learn the knowledge of production struggle and class struggle. Everyone knows that building socialism is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. All enemies use all kinds of reactionary and decadent ideas and lifestyles to influence young people and lure young people away from the revolution, away from the workers and peasants, and away from the organization. If we do not care about politics and do not make ourselves have socialist ideological awareness, it is impossible to serve socialist construction wholeheartedly, and in the sharp and complex class struggle, there is a danger of losing direction, and even a danger of becoming a prisoner of the enemy. We also know that the transition to socialism is to make our country's production have advanced scientific and technological levels. Without mastering advanced science and technology, we cannot advance our cause. Young people in our country must launch a movement to advance towards science. There is no easy way here, the only way is to study hard, to learn from participating in actual struggles, to use spare time to learn, to combine learning and doing, and to combine self-efforts with humbly asking everyone for advice.

What young people must remember even more is that in the struggle to build and defend socialism, हमust resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party and rely on the masses. The leadership of the party is the guarantee of all our victories. Without the leadership of the party, there would be no socialist construction. Only by resolutely supporting the leadership of the party can we ensure that we advance on the broad road of socialism. Whoever violates the leadership of the party is likely to be led by Hu Feng elements and other counter-revolutionary elements to the dangerous road of corruption, degeneration, and betrayal of the revolution. This is an unshakeable revolutionary truth. The masses are the source of strength for building a socialist society. When individuals are combined with the broad masses, things can be done well. If individuals are separated from the masses, they will accomplish nothing. Therefore, never be proud, never be complacent, and never forget to rely on the masses at any time and place, and humbly learn from the masses. This is another great revolutionary truth.

With the leadership of the Party and closely united with the masses, the youthful strength of our young generation can radiate ten thousand feet of brilliance for socialist construction!

Young comrades across the country, the convening of the National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction is a manifestation of the Party and the state's care, hope, and trust in us. We must not fail the ardent expectations of the Party and the state. We believe that in the near future, a mass movement to strive to be active members of socialist construction will emerge among young people, and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions of young activists will emerge. Comrades, for socialism, let us bravely move forward!

    把青春献给社会主义
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记  胡克实
    再过几天，在祖国的首都，全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会就要开幕了。这是全国青年生活中的一件大事，也是全国人民关心的一件大事。因为有一千五百多个最优秀的青年积极分子，代表全国各个战线上的千百万青年建设者到北京会师，向祖国汇报成绩，介绍经验；接受党中央的指示，听取团中央的报告；讨论实现五年计划中青年的任务，并且提出自己今后努力的计划。这就一定要引起全国青年为社会主义建设立功的新的高潮。
    全国青年热烈拥护这个向社会主义进军的大会。各地青年正在以实际行动向大会献礼，譬如：北京张百发、胡耀林、冯本森、于春和等四个青年突击队发起在九月份超额百分之二十完成任务，并降低原材料损耗到行政规定的百分之二以下；兰新铁路青年职工，决定提前铺轨到张掖；哈尔滨某厂青工李守安提出节约钢材的倡议，并保证在九月至十二月，再给国家节约二十四吨钢材；河南农村青年，展开了千车万担的割草积肥运动；黑龙江海伦县人和村农业生产合作社主任孙显忠发起了在秋收中一公顷土地多收五十斤粮食，全省在秋收中为国家增收四亿斤粮食的运动；河北唐山专区十三万青年参加玉米人工授粉，计划增产五百八十三万多斤粮食；中央实验歌剧院的青年团员积极展开创作活动，为大会创作了十一首歌曲。这些事实，证明了青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，现在已经成了全国青年为社会主义建设立功的新高潮将要到来的标志。
    为社会主义建设立功，这是我们这一代青年人的幸福。只有在毛泽东时代，劳动人民已经当家作主，建设社会主义已经成为现实生活，我们才能亲身从事这样光辉伟大的事业。历史给了我们这种至高无上的幸福，让我们把宝贵的青春献给社会主义。
    为社会主义建设立功，更是我们这一代青年人光荣的责任。因为建设社会主义是一个艰巨困难的历史任务，它需要人们坚持不懈地进行斗争，需要人们付出巨大的劳动。而我国青年有一亿二千万之多，他们精力充沛，勇于前进，所以青年应该成为建设社会主义的一支巨大的突击力量。党和国家向青年们提出的要求是：把自己青春的力量，毫无保留地献给社会主义。
    几年来的事实，说明我国青年是理解到自己的幸福，是尽到了他们自己的责任的。他们积极参加了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各种斗争，并在斗争中表现了英勇顽强的精神，证明了他们并不是空口赞扬社会主义的空谈家，而是脚踏实地的为社会主义贡献了自己力量的勇士。但是，青年同志们，我们是永远不满足过去成绩的人，我们是永远要向前看再向前看的人。党中央和毛主席亲手制定的第一个五年计划已经正式宣布了，全国青年必须更加奋勇地参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各项斗争，把我们的工作做得更好，把祖国的事业大大地向前推进。
    应该指出，在我国，任何工作岗位上的青年，都有为社会主义建设创造成绩、贡献自己才能的机会。因为，在我国建设社会主义社会，就是要使我国的政治、经济、文化、国防的各个方面，都要逐步做到完全合乎社会主义的先进标准。我们的战线，是非常广阔的。每一件岗位的工作，都是为建设社会主义社会而斗争中的决不可缺少的方面，都是非常光荣的大有出息的工作，都有施展才能的大好机会。事实上，我国青年也已经在不同的工作岗位上，在不同的社会主义建设的战线上，作出了重要的贡献。从这次将要参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的青年代表中，就可以证明这一点。我们可以看到从我国的旅大市来的，两年半内完成了四年生产定额的大连造船公司青年车工朱维勤，从我国中原地区来的始终坚持合作化道路，克服了种种困难，使得合作社由七户扩大到九十二户的青年社长文香兰。同时也可以看到来自我国的边远地区，在千里无人烟的原始森林中，同疾病作斗争获得了优异成绩的模范医生金振都。我们可以看到来自祖国国防最前线的战斗英雄柏文昌，他在解放一江山岛的战斗中，创造了陆海军协同作战的范例。同时也可以看到从后方的战线上来保卫祖国的普通青年刻字工人吴德元，他在五年来共检举了二百八十一名反革命分子和刑事罪犯。我们可以看到受过高等教育，并在苏联专家的谆谆教诲下，掌握了先进的科学技术，因而在工作中有所创造的鞍山市劳动模范胡兆森。同时也可以看到原来只有初小文化程度，但由于刻苦自学和积极参加实际工作，而今成了科学工作者的华北农业研究所的青年赵质培。我们不但可以看到无数的对敌斗争英雄、工农业劳动模范，还可以看到不少来自那些被人们认为是平凡工作岗位的模范工作者。这儿有原热河省建昌县玲珑塔区供销合作社营业员许梦芝，她深入了解群众要求，按农民的需要销货，成为全国合作社系统的先进工作者；有浙江省东阳县农场饲养员华银凤，她在工作中创造了一套科学的喂猪方法，过去两个人才能管理七十一只猪，而她一个人就能担负九十六只猪的饲养工作；有山东省临沂县十六区中坦村民校教师杨锡印，他在教学工作中创造了单元复式教学法，使得需要学习两个冬天、一个常年才能达到扫盲目的的课程，不要脱离生产，只需六个月就可以学完。这些活生生的例子，难道不是说明我国伟大的社会主义建设事业，已经为青年们开辟了无限广阔的发展前途吗？可见工作性质的不同，工作地区的不同，文化水平的不同，前方和后方的不同，都丝毫不能限制青年的发展。条条道路通向社会主义，每一个工作岗位都是社会主义战士用武之地。因此，各行各业的青年，都应该信心百倍地奋勇投入实际斗争，争取在不久的将来，成为社会主义建设的积极分子。
    这是党和国家对全体青年的希望，也是每个青年应该有的志向。
    要成为社会主义建设积极分子，把青春献给社会主义，这首先就是勤勤恳恳地劳动。创造、发明当然是可贵的，因为如果都能像王崇伦那样，在一年中完成四年的工作量，我们就可以大大地加速我国社会主义建设的步伐。但这并不是说，只有在工作中有了发明创造的人，才是社会主义建设的积极分子。同志们，不是的。要做一个社会主义建设的积极分子，是有多种多样的方式让你贡献自己力量的。如果我们能够在青年突击队中，在青年节约队中当一名好队员，在农业生产合作社中当一个好社员，在农村中推广先进的耕作技术，努力参加积肥运动，积极参加开荒、植树，这些都是积极参加社会主义建设的表现，也都是社会主义建设的积极分子。本溪煤矿工人王恒成，在六年中没有缺勤，五年中没有发生一次事故；大连水泥厂车工齐长源，八年半没有缺勤，没有违犯过一次劳动纪律，七年半没有出过一次废品，没有丢失或损坏过一件工具。他们两人，虽然没有什么发明创造，但是他们一直诚恳地劳动，同样使他们成为社会主义建设的积极分子，并将光荣地参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。因此，重要的问题就在于认真负起自己的一份责任，诚诚实实地劳动。
    要做一个社会主义建设积极分子，还必须努力学习生产斗争和阶级斗争的知识，大家知道，建设社会主义，就是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，一切敌人用各色各样反动腐朽的思想和生活方式来影响青年，引诱青年脱离革命，脱离工农，脱离组织。如果我们不关心政治，不使自己具有社会主义的思想觉悟，就不可能全心全意地为社会主义建设服务，而且在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，有迷失方向的危险，甚至有成为敌人俘虏的危险。我们又知道，过渡到社会主义，就是要使我国的生产具有先进的科学技术水平，不掌握先进的科学技术就不能推进我们的事业，我国青年一定要展开向科学进军的运动。在这里省力的办法是没有的，唯一的办法就是刻苦地学习，从参加实际斗争中来学习，利用业余时间来学习，把学和做结合起来，把自我努力同虚心同向一切人请教结合起来。
    青年们更要紧紧记住的是：在建设和保卫社会主义的斗争中，我们必须坚决地依靠党的领导，依靠群众。党的领导是我们一切胜利的保证，没有党的领导，就没有社会主义建设。只有坚决拥护党的领导，才可以保证自己在社会主义的康庄大道上前进，谁要违背了党的领导，谁就有可能被胡风分子以及其他反革命分子引向腐化堕落背叛革命的危险道路。这是一条颠扑不破的革命真理。群众是建设社会主义社会的力量的源泉，个人同广大群众相结合，就可以把事情办好，个人如果脱离了群众，就会一事无成。因此，永不骄傲，永不自满，随时随地不要忘记依靠群众，虚心向群众学习，这又是一条革命的大道理。
    有了党的领导，同群众紧密团结在一起，我们年轻一代的青春力量就能为社会主义建设发放出万丈光辉！
    全国青年同志们，全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的召开是党和国家对我们的关怀、希望和信任的表现。我们一定不要辜负党和国家的殷切期望。我们相信，不久的将来，在青年当中出现一个争取做社会主义建设积极分子的群众运动，涌现出几万、几十万、上千万的青年积极分子。同志们，为了社会主义，大家奋勇前进吧！
