    Visiting Arab Youth Friends
    By Our Correspondent Féng Zhīdān
    In the Peace Hotel in Beijing, I interviewed youth representatives from several Arab countries who were invited to China after attending the World Youth Festival.
    As soon as we met, we started talking about the festival. The head of the Iraqi youth delegation, a leader of the youth movement, reminisced about the festival. He said, "At the festival, we saw that young people from all over the world shared a common aspiration, which is peace and friendship." He continued, "The impression of Warsaw is unforgettable. Warsaw is a city that was destroyed by war. In Warsaw, people can see that war can only bring disaster and destruction to the people."
    "Therefore," he said, "the Iraqi people undoubtedly stand on the side of peace. Iraq launched a nationwide movement against the American aggression in the Korean War. Later, the people also strongly opposed the Turkish-British and Turkish-Iraqi pacts. In July 1954, a peace conference was held in the Iraqi capital, attended by representatives from all parties and groups, including members of parliament, to oppose the Turkish-British military pact. However, due to the imperialists' hostility to the peace movement, the Iraqi people's struggle for peace was met with brutal suppression."
    Hadi, a staff member of the Iraqi Sports Club, and a university student from the Iraqi Jidd tribe also joined our conversation. Hadi told me that he was expelled from a military academy for demanding peace and national independence. The university student from the Jidd tribe told me that today, not only are there British military bases and economic forces in Iraq, but the United States is also developing its influence. Since Iraq accepted so-called "US aid," more than two hundred American military "advisers" have supervised the Iraqi army, and American oil monopolies have intensified their penetration into Iraq. But both he and Hadi said that the Iraqi people are unyielding. In October 1952, a large demonstration of 100,000 people was held in the Iraqi capital, which lasted for more than seven days, demonstrating the people's will to oppose imperialism and demand peace.
    The head of the Iraqi delegation left because he had other business. Hadi and the university student from the Jidd tribe finally talked about their impressions of New China. Hadi said, "We came to China as if we were at home. We were moved by the hospitality of the Chinese people." He continued, "I have seen the new life of New China in Beijing. We have visited the families of New China's farmers, and their miserable old life is gone forever. We have visited Peking University, where New China's university students are happily studying. What particularly interests me is that there are many basketball courts in the courtyards on both sides of the streets in Beijing, where young people are happily playing basketball." Hadi said enthusiastically, "Our people deeply love the Chinese people. When I was elected by the youth of Basra as a representative to participate in the festival, they told me to bring blessings to the people of New China." The university student from the Jidd tribe added to his friend Hadi's words, saying, "Anyone who comes to China must admit that the Chinese people love peace and hope to be friendly with the people of all countries. The Chinese people love peace and their country."
    Our Iraqi friends also expressed their support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan. They said: Taiwan is Chinese territory and should be returned to China. The Iraqi people sympathize with the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.
    At the residence of the Kuwaiti representative, I met Hamoudi, a young dockworker from Kuwait. Kuwait is an oil-rich country. People from this country often proudly talk about their country's oil resources. Hamoudi told me an astonishing number. In 1954, this country with a population of 200,000 produced more than 50 million tons of oil. But Hamoudi said, "This wealth does not belong to the people, but is divided up by American and British monopolies. Our people still live an extremely miserable life. The people demand to control the fate of oil."
    Hamoudi, as the first person from his country to visit New China, was particularly moved. He said, "I came to a country where all nationalities live equally in happiness. Such a country is a great force for defending peace. We Kuwaitis are subjected to the cruel oppression of British and American colonialists, those colonialists swaggering and howling ‘Anglo-Saxon first’. When we arrived in New China, the Chinese youth and people received us so warmly, like brothers. This cannot but move us!"
    I also visited some representatives from Syria. Baba, this talented comedic radio actor, is well-known in the Middle East. Baba brings laughter to the Arab people every day; therefore, the Arab people also love Baba. Baba said to me, "The festival is for peace and friendship, which is a common feeling for every participant. I am going to tell the young men and women of the Arab world on the Damascus radio that we were so happy in Warsaw. I am also going to tell them that the 'Iron Curtain' promoted by the United States is a lie. I want to tell them the truth, that the people here are working hard for peace."
    Naftaji, a young trade union worker, completely agreed with Baba's words, saying, "The only difference is that I am going to convey the achievements of the festival to the workers at the meetings." Another Syrian newspaper editor said that he would publish articles in his newspaper to convey the spirit of the festival.
    The topic turned to the spearhead of colonialism extending into Syria. Baba said: "Syria has embarked on the road to national independence, and now we must strive to consolidate and maintain our independence. Imperialism is always preparing to destroy our independence." So, the young Syrian friends talked about the assassination of Syrian Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Maliki by imperialist mercenaries about five months ago. Baba said: "The colonel loved his nation and firmly opposed joining the Turkish-Iraqi military pact. Therefore, the imperialists assassinated him." At this time, Ayubi, a famous Syrian football referee, came into the house. Ayubi described the scene he witnessed of the colonel's assassination. At that time, he was performing his refereeing duties on the football field, and the colonel was watching the football match. Damascus football fans were enjoying this peaceful life. But in an instant, a sinful gunshot rang out, and two bullets hit the colonel's head. Ayubi told me that just a week before the colonel was assassinated, the wife of a staff member of a foreign embassy stationed in Damascus "advised" the colonel to leave Syria and go abroad, but the colonel rejected the threat. Ayubi said: "The entire Syrian people are angered by the atrocities of imperialism. The people will continue to oppose imperialism and the Turkish-Iraqi military pact."
    Baba and Ayubi also talked about the Syrian people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. Ayubi himself has read many books about New China, and they are eager to learn more about New China.
    Like the young friends in Syria, the young friends in Lebanon also love peace and firmly oppose the imperialists' conspiracy to piece together a Middle East aggressive bloc. In our meeting, the young lawyer Shuba said, "Whoever doesn't love peace, please go to Auschwitz to see it. It's unimaginable that millions of people died tragically." The head of the Lebanese delegation interjected: "Auschwitz - barbaric, inhumane." The head of the delegation continued: "The consequences of future wars will be even more serious due to new weapons. Therefore, the Lebanese people firmly oppose joining the Turkish-Iraqi pact. The people also know that joining the Turkish-Iraqi pact not only threatens peace, but also means losing independence, and American military forces will infiltrate Lebanon."
    The head of the delegation talked about his feelings about the friendly feelings between the Lebanese and Chinese people. He said: "The Chinese people are so lovely. After arriving in China, the welcome from young men and women even moved some members of our delegation to tears. Arabs often say that we are the most hospitable, but I find that the Chinese are even more hospitable than us." Finally, he said: "The Lebanese people demand the establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China. It is ridiculous that Chiang Kai-shek 'represents' China."
    At the end of this interview, I would like to particularly mention Michel, a young Lebanese painter. When I walked into Michel's room, before I had time to sit down, he took out a thick roll of paintings. On his journey of peace and friendship, the painter painted from Syria, Romania, Poland, the Soviet Union, all the way to China. He painted the scenery and people along the way. In Beijing, he has painted a corner of this ancient but reborn city. He pointed to this painting and said to me: "Looking down from a high place, Beijing is too beautiful." Michel is an excellent messenger of peace. He collected 1,500 peace signatures in Lebanon, and therefore won the award from the World Federation of Democratic Youth at the festival. Michel told me a very touching story. Last year, he set off from the town of Tyre to the countryside to collect peace signatures. Twelve Muslim villages and one Christian village launched a signature craze. In one village, a wedding was about to be held when Michel arrived. Michel attended the wedding, and the guests, including the village chief, signed their names, and the bride and groom also signed their names. The groom took Michel's arm, danced with joyful steps, and sang a self-composed peace ditty. Michel brought the blessings of peace to this newly married couple and this jubilant village.
    Yes, not only are there newly married couples in a certain village in Lebanon; in every corner of the world, many ordinary people are excitedly looking forward to a happy life in the future, and are eagerly looking forward to lasting world peace.

    访问阿拉伯的青年朋友们
    本报记者　冯之丹
    在北京的和平宾馆里，记者访问了参加世界青年联欢节后应邀来中国的一些阿拉伯国家的青年代表。
    一见面，就谈起联欢节来了。伊拉克青年代表团团长是一位青年运动的领袖，他回忆着联欢节。他说：“我们在联欢节看到了全世界青年都怀着一个共同的意愿，那就是和平和友谊。”他接着说：“人们对华沙的印象是难忘的。华沙是被战争摧毁过的城市，在华沙，人们能够看到，战争只能给人民带来灾难和破坏。”
    “因此”，他说：“伊拉克人民毫无疑问地是站在和平这一边的。伊拉克曾掀起了一个全国性的运动，反对美国侵略朝鲜的战争。后来，人民也强烈地反对土巴和土伊协定。一九五四年七月，伊拉克首都举行过和平大会，全国各党派、团体，包括国会议员都有代表出席这次大会，反对土巴军事协定。但是由于帝国主义仇视和平运动，伊拉克人民争取和平的斗争遭到了残酷的镇压。”
    伊拉克体育俱乐部的一位工作人员哈第和伊拉克吉德族的一位大学生也参加了我们的谈话。哈第告诉我，他是因为要求和平和民族独立从一个军事学院里被开除出来的。吉德族的大学生告诉我，今天在伊拉克不仅有英国的军事基地和经济势力，而且美国也在发展它的势力。自从伊拉克接受所谓“美援”后，二百名以上的美军“顾问”监督了伊拉克的军队，美国的石油垄断资本更变本加厉地渗入了伊拉克。但是他和哈第都说，伊拉克人民是不屈的。一九五二年十月在伊拉克首都曾经举行过十万人的大示威，示威持续了七天以上，显示了人民反对帝国主义和要求和平的意志。
    伊拉克代表团团长因为有事先出去了。哈第和吉德族的大学生最后谈到他们对新中国的印象。哈第说：“我们来到了中国，像是到了自己的家里一样，中国人民的好客的热情使我们感动。”他继续说：“我在北京已经看到了新中国的新生活，我们访问过新中国农民的家庭，他们的悲惨的旧生活已经一去不复返了。我们访问过北京大学，新中国的大学生正在那里幸福地学习着。使我特别感兴趣的是，在北京大街两旁的庭院里有着许多篮球场，年轻人在那里愉快地玩着篮球。”哈第热情地说：“我们的人民深爱着中国人民，当我被巴士拉城的青年选为参加联欢节的代表时，他们嘱咐我要把祝福带给新中国的人民。”那位吉德族的大学生补充了他的朋友哈第的话，他说：“任何人来到了中国都得承认中国人民是热爱和平和希望同各国人民友好的。中国人民爱和平，也爱自己的国家。”
    我们的伊拉克朋友并且表示对中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争的支持。他们说：台湾是中国的领土，应该归还给中国。伊拉克人民同情中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    在科威特代表的住处，我见到了科威特的青年码头工人哈摩第。科威特，这是个石油之国。这个国家里来的人常常自豪地谈到他们祖国的石油富源。哈摩第告诉我一个惊人的数目字。一九五四年这个二十万人口的国家产石油五千万吨以上。但是哈摩第说：“这些财富并没有为人民所有，而是被美、英垄断资本瓜分了。我们的人民迄今过着极其悲惨的生活。人民要求支配石油的命运。”
    哈摩第，作为他的国家访问新中国的第一个人，特别有所感触。他说：“我来到了这样的国家，所有的民族都平等地生活在幸福里。这样的国家是保卫和平的伟大力量。我们科威特人受着英、美殖民者的残酷的压迫，那些殖民主义者耀武扬威地嗥叫
  ‘盎格罗—撒克逊第一’。我们到了新中国，中国青年和人民是这样热情地、像兄弟一样地接待着我们。这不能不使我们感动啊！”
    我也访问了叙利亚的一些代表们。巴巴，这位有天才的喜剧广播演员，在中近东是远近闻名的。巴巴每天把欢笑带给阿拉伯人民；因此阿拉伯人民也喜爱巴巴。巴巴对我说，“联欢节是为了和平和友谊，这是每个参加者都有同感的。我将要在大马士革的电台广播中告诉阿拉伯的青年男女，我们在华沙是多么地愉快。我也要告诉他们，美国所宣传的‘铁幕’是骗人的。我要把真理告诉他们，这里的人民正为了和平而努力地工作着。”
    纳夫塔齐，一个年青的工会工作者完全同意巴巴的话，他说，“所不同的是，我将要在集会上向工人们传达联欢节的成就。”另一位叙利亚报纸的总编辑说，他将要在他的报纸上发表文章来传达联欢节的精神。
    话题转到了伸入叙利亚的殖民主义的矛头。巴巴说：“叙利亚已经走上了民族独立的道路，现在我们必须力求巩固和维护我们的独立。帝国主义时刻在准备着毁坏我们的独立。”于是，叙利亚的青年朋友们谈起了约五个月以前叙利亚陆军副参谋长马利基上校被帝国主义的雇佣分子所刺杀的事件。巴巴说：“上校挚爱他的民族，坚决反对参加土伊军事协定。因此，帝国主义者刺杀了他。”这时叙利亚著名的足球裁判员阿由比进屋来了。阿由比叙述了他目睹上校被刺的情形。当时他正在足球场上执行着裁判的任务，上校正在观看足球比赛。大马士革的足球爱好者们正在享受着这和平的生活。但是瞬间响起了罪恶的枪声，两颗子弹击中了上校的头颅。阿由比告诉我说，就在上校被刺前的一星期，一个驻大马士革的外国大使馆人员的妻子“忠告”上校离开叙利亚到外国去，但是上校拒绝了威胁。阿由比说：“全叙利亚人民为帝国主义的暴行所激怒。人民将继续反对帝国主义，反对土伊军事协定。”
    巴巴和阿由比也都谈到叙利亚人民对中国人民友好的感情。阿由比自己读了许多关于新中国的书籍，他们渴望更多地了解新中国。
    同叙利亚的青年朋友一样，黎巴嫩的青年朋友也热爱和平，坚决反对帝国主义者拼凑中东侵略集团的阴谋。在我们的会见中，年青的律师舒巴说：“谁不爱和平，就请他到奥斯威辛去看看吧，简直不能想像数百万人的惨死。”黎巴嫩代表团团长插上来说：“奥斯威辛——野蛮，惨无人道。”团长接着又说：“今后战争的后果由于有了新武器，那就更严重了。因此，黎巴嫩人民坚决反对参加土伊协定。人民更知道，参加土伊协定不仅威胁和平，而且也意味着丧失独立，美国军事势力就会渗入到黎巴嫩。”
    代表团团长谈到他对于黎巴嫩人民和中国人民之间友好的感情。他说：“中国人民太可爱了。到了中国以后，男女青年对我们的欢迎，甚至使我们代表团里有些团员感动得掉下热泪。阿拉伯人常说，我们是最好客的，但是我发现中国人比我们还要好客。”最后他说：“黎巴嫩人民要求同中华人民共和国建立外交和贸易关系。蒋介石‘代表’中国，实在是荒唐可笑的。”
    在结束这篇访问记的时候，我要特别提到黎巴嫩青年画家米歇尔。当我走进米歇尔的房间，还来不及坐定，他就取出了厚厚一卷画稿。画家在和平和友谊的旅途中从叙利亚、罗马尼亚、波兰、苏联，一直画到了中国。他画的是沿途景物和人。在北京，他已画下了这个古老然而已经新生了的城市的一角。他指着这张画对我说：“从高处眺望，北京是太美丽了。”米歇尔是个优秀的和平使者。他在黎巴嫩征集了一千五百人的和平签名，因而在联欢节上获得了世界民主青年联盟的奖励。米歇尔告诉我一个非常动人的故事。去年，他从梯尔镇出发下乡去征集和平签名，十二个信奉回教的村庄，一个信奉基督教的村庄都掀起了签名热潮。其中有一个村，当米歇尔到达时正要举行一个婚礼。米歇尔参加了婚礼，包括村长在内的宾客们都签了名，新郎新娘也签了名，新郎挽着米歇尔的手臂，踏着欢乐的舞步，唱起了自编的和平小调。米歇尔把和平的祝福带给了这对新婚的夫妇和这个欢腾的村庄。
    是的，不仅在黎巴嫩的某个村庄里有着新婚的夫妇；在全世界各个角落，许许多多普通的人民都兴奋地憧憬着未来的幸福生活，热切地期望着世界的持久和平。
