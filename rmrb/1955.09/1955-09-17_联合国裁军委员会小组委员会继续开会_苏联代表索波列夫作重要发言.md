Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 15th: It is learned here that at the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee meeting on the 13th, Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out that U.S. representative Stassen's speech at the Subcommittee meeting on the 13th was worthy of careful study. Sobolev recounted that the Soviet delegation had studied President Eisenhower's proposal with great seriousness. He pointed out that some questions arose during the study. One of these questions was whether Eisenhower's proposal considered aerial photography to be conducted only over the territories of the United States and the Soviet Union, or whether this method of supervision would be extended to other signatory countries of the disarmament convention.

    Sobolev pointed out that it could be seen from the speeches of the British, French, and Canadian representatives that these countries agreed with the levels for the reduction of armed forces of the five major powers proposed by Britain and France, and accepted by the Soviet Union. The Soviet delegation could point out that Britain, France, Canada, and the Soviet Union held consistent attitudes towards the important items in the plan for the reduction of armaments and armed forces and the prohibition of atomic weapons. As previously indicated, the United States has not yet clearly expressed its attitude towards these proposals.

    Sobolev pointed out that the Soviet delegation believed that there were no differing opinions on the issue of establishing effective supervision over the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces, especially the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union advocated establishing a practical and effective supervisory system for the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. There was also a consensus on the issue of on-site inspections as a component of the supervisory system.

    Sobolev said, "The Soviet delegation believes that further convergence of views must be sought on the issue of supervision, and this issue must be studied in close connection with measures for the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, as well as measures for building international trust."

    The Soviet representative pointed out the erroneous attitude of French representative Moch in the Subcommittee. Moch underestimated the significance of large numbers of ground, air, and naval forces and considered the Soviet proposal for timely prevention of dangerous concentrations of ground, air, and naval forces to be "outdated."

    Sobolev said, "We believe that conditions must be created so that the aggressive intentions of any country can be discovered and prevented in a timely manner."

    The Soviet representative also spoke about the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons. He said, "The Soviet government believes that atomic and hydrogen weapons should be prohibited, and the Soviet government is making every effort to reach an agreement on this issue, because such an agreement is fully in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 15th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee held a regular meeting on September 14th. French representative Jules Moch served as chairman.

    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会继续开会
    苏联代表索波列夫作重要发言
    新华社十六日讯  据塔斯社纽约十五日讯：此间已经知道，在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会十三日会议上，苏联代表索波列夫指出，美国代表史塔生在小组委员会十三日会议上的发言是值得仔细研究的。索波列夫追述道，苏联代表团极其郑重地研究了艾森豪威尔总统的建议。他指出，在研究过程中产生了一些问题。这些问题之一是：在艾森豪威尔的建议中是否认为，空中摄影仅在美国和苏联领土上进行，或者是认为这种监督方法也将推广而适用于裁军公约的其他缔约国。
    索波列夫指出，从英国、法国和加拿大代表的发言中可以看出，这些国家同意英国和法国建议的，并且由苏联所接受的五大国武装部队裁减后的水平。苏联代表团可以指出，英国、法国、加拿大和苏联对裁减军备和武装部队及禁止原子武器的计划中的各重要项目的态度是一致的。正如以前所指明的，美国对这些建议还没有明确表示自己的态度。
    索波列夫指出，苏联代表团认为，在对裁减常规军备和武装部队、特别是对禁止原子武器建立有效监督的问题上，并没有分歧的意见。苏联主张在裁减军备和禁止原子武器方面建立切实有效的监督制度。在作为监督制度的组成部分的视察问题上，彼此的态度也是一致的。
    索波列夫说：“苏联代表团认为，在有关监督的问题上，必须进一步求得彼此观点的接近，要同裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施以及建立国际信任的措施密切联系在一起来研究这个问题。”
    苏联代表指出法国代表莫克在小组委员会中的错误的态度。莫克过低地估计了大量陆军、空军和海军部队的意义，并且认为苏联关于及时地防止陆军、空军和海军部队危险地集结的建议是“过时的”。
    索波列夫说：“我们认为，必须造成这样一种条件，要使任何国家的侵略意图都能够及时地被发觉和受到制止。”
    苏联代表还谈到禁止原子武器的问题。他说：“苏联政府认为原子武器和氢武器应当被禁止，苏联政府并且竭尽一切努力以便就这个问题达成协议，因为这种协议是完全符合世界各国人民的切身利益的。”
    新华社十六日讯  塔斯社纽约十五日讯：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会九月十四日举行例会。法国代表儒勒·莫克担任主席。
