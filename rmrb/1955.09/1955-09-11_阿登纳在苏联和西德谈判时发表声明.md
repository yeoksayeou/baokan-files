Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 10th: According to TASS, during the negotiations between the Soviet and Federal Republic of Germany government delegations on September 9th, Dr. Adenauer issued a statement.

Adenauer first thanked Bulganin, then said: The Federal Government and I personally fully realize the great significance of this visit. Before this first contact, not only had many years passed without formal relations between the two countries, but there had also been many events that had caused and maintained a feeling of separation and estrangement. Therefore, I recognize how difficult it must be for all of us to begin these negotiations. However, this does not change the fact that these negotiations are necessary.

Adenauer continued: I believe my primary task is to explain to you the basic attitudes, our driving forces and motivations, and the ultimate goals that govern our actions, which determine the political course of the German people and their government.

Adenauer said: The highest value that all Germans must strive to maintain is peace. I would like to remind you that the Federal Republic has bound itself with a clear declaration renouncing the use of force. I would like to remind you again that the Federal Republic, in accordance with the defensive treaties it has concluded, has voluntarily abandoned the production of atomic, biological, and chemical weapons.

Adenauer added: But if peace is to bring its full benefits, then it must never be jeopardized; it must be guaranteed. If we mainly establish ties with a major national organization by organizing the Western European Union and participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we are doing so entirely out of a desire to strengthen peace. Adenauer said: The treaties establishing the Western European Union include provisions that contain elements of a security system that may be suitable for expansion and application to broader relationships, thereby potentially helping to establish a larger security system.

Adenauer continued: Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, in your note of June 7th extending your invitation, you emphasized "the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany" as your guiding principle. You stated in your note that this normalization is "required by the interests of peace and European security, as well as the national interests of the Soviet and German peoples," and this statement is certainly correct.

Adenauer said: But what can be done to bring about this normalization? I do not believe that it is enough to prohibit war, establish a security system, and somewhat mechanically establish diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations. I am deeply convinced that genuine normalization of relations can only be achieved if we examine the causes that make our current relations abnormal and make every effort to eliminate these causes. Therefore, I will now address two types of issues.

Speaking of the first type of issue in his mind, Adenauer said: Please allow me to begin by talking about the release of those Germans who are currently still imprisoned in Soviet territory or within its sphere of influence, or who are not allowed to leave this region. I hope you will not think it provocative if I say that as long as this issue is not resolved, it is unimaginable to establish "normal" relations between our two countries. This is not a "precondition" that I am proposing. What I am talking about here is normalization itself.

Speaking of the second type of issue, Adenauer said: Another issue is the reunification of Germany. I believe we agree with you that the division of Germany has created an intolerable situation and that German unity must be restored. I believe we also agree that achieving this unity is the obligation of the four major powers that held supreme authority in Germany after the collapse of Nazi Germany, and I demand that this obligation be fulfilled. I must repeat once again: I am not putting forward any "preconditions," but what I am talking about here is the very essence of normalization. Let us do our best to move forward on this issue in our negotiations. Without the reunification of Germany, there is no real security in Europe.

Adenauer continued: I know the argument against this is that a reunified Germany might pose a threat to the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union anticipates that its security will be harmed as a result of German reunification, then we are fully willing to contribute our share and cooperate in a security system that would also dispel such concerns. It seems correct to consider a European security system while considering how to restore German unity.

Adenauer then said: An understanding of these necessities will guide us in our joint handling of issues related to the establishment of diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations. The Federal Government agrees with the view that establishing such relations would be of great benefit to both countries and their mutual relations. Direct contact between the two governments will certainly help to obtain a more accurate judgment that can properly assess the mutual realities. The economic situations of the two countries undoubtedly provide opportunities for each to learn from the other's strengths. Similarly, the exchange of cultural treasures and scientific publications is also a welcome goal.

Finally, Adenauer spoke of his main feelings, saying: I am very grateful for this opportunity to conduct frank negotiations. I recognize the difficulty of these negotiations, which can only be a beginning. I believe that the purpose of these negotiations is to address the issue of normalizing our relations as a whole, based on the situation I have described. I hope and wish that after the end of our stay in Moscow, our current negotiations will continue in a manner yet to be arranged.

### 阿登纳在苏联和西德谈判时发表声明

    阿登纳在苏联和西德谈判时发表声明
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在九月九日苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团谈判时，阿登纳博士发表了一个声明。
    阿登纳首先对布尔加宁表示感谢，然后说：联邦政府和我本人都充分意识到这次访问的重大意义。在这个第一次接触之前，不仅经过了两国间没有存在正式关系的许多年代，而且有过曾经引起并且保持一种分离和隔阂的感觉的许多事件。因此，我认识到，我们大家开始这次谈判一定会是一件多么困难的事情。但是，这并没有改变这次谈判是必要的这一事实。
    阿登纳接着说：我认为我的首要任务是向你们说明决定着德国人民和他们的政府的政治路线的基本态度、我们的推动力和动机以及支配着我们的行动的最终目的。
    阿登纳说：所有德国人必须努力维护的最高价值就是和平。我愿意提醒你们：联邦共和国已经用放弃使用武力的明确声明来约束它自己。我愿意再提醒你们：联邦共和国按照它所缔结的防御性条约，已经自愿放弃原子武器、生物武器和化学武器的生产。
    阿登纳又说：但是，如果要和平带来它的充分利益，那末，它就绝不能受到危害，它必须得到保障。如果我们主要是通过组织西欧联盟和通过参加北大西洋公约来同一个主要的国家组织建立联系，那我们完全是从加强和平的愿望出发的。阿登纳说：建立西欧联盟的条约中包括一些条款，其中存在着一些安全体系的因素，它们可能很适宜于扩大到并且适用于更广泛的关系上，从而很可能有助于建立一个更大的安全体系。
    阿登纳接着说：部长会议主席先生，你在你六月七日的提出你的邀请的照会中，强调指出“苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系的正常化”作为你的指导思想。你在你的照会中说“和平和欧洲安全的利益以及苏联和德国人民的民族利益需要”这种正常化，这种说法肯定地是正确的。
    阿登纳说：但是，可以做些什么才能带来这种正常化呢？我并不认为禁止战争、建立安全体系和相当机械地建立外交、经济和文化关系就够了。我倒是深信：真正的关系正常化只有在我们研究使目前我们之间的关系不正常的原因和尽一切努力来消除这些原因才能实现。因此，我现在来谈两类问题。
    阿登纳谈到他心目中的第一类问题说：请容许我开始先谈谈释放那些目前还被监禁在苏联领土或势力范围内、要不然就是不得离开这个地区的德国人的问题。如果我说，只要这个问题一天未得到解决，那末建立我们两国之间的“正常”关系就是不可想像的，我希望你不要以为这是挑衅的话。这并不是我提出的“先决条件”。我在这里所说的是正常化本身。
    阿登纳谈到第二类问题说：另外一个问题是德国国家统一的问题。我相信我们同你们一致认为德国的分裂造成了一个不能容忍的情况，并且认为必须恢复德国的统一。我认为我们也同意，实现这种统一是在国社党德国崩溃以后在德国拥有最高权力的四大国的义务，我要求履行这种义务。我必须再重复一遍：我不是提出任何“先决条件”，但是我在这里所谈到的就是正常化的本身。让我们在我们的谈判中尽力在这个问题上前进一步罢。不实现德国的统一，欧洲就没有真正的安全。
    阿登纳接着说：我知道反对的理由是：重新统一的德国可能构成对苏联的威胁。如果苏联预料，由于德国重新统一的结果，苏联的安全会受到损害，那末，我们完全愿意贡献我们的一份力量，在一个也会消除这种忧虑的安全体系中进行合作。在考虑如何恢复德国统一的同时，也考虑欧洲的安全体系，看来这样做是正确的。
    阿登纳然后说：对于这些必要性的了解将会在我们共同处理有关建立外交、经济和文化关系的问题时成为我们的指针。联邦政府同意这样的意见：建立这种关系对于两国和它们的相互关系是会有很大好处的。两国政府间的直接接触肯定有助于获得能够适当地估计相互的现实情况的较为精确的判断。两国的经济情况无疑提供了彼此取长补短的机会。同样，文化珍品和科学出版物的交换，也是一个令人欢迎的目标。
    阿登纳最后谈到他的主要感想说：我非常感谢有这个进行坦率的谈判的机会。我认识这种谈判的困难，这种谈判只能是一个开端。我认为这次谈判的目的是根据我所说明的情况把使我们的关系正常化的问题作为一个整体来处理的。我希望并且预祝：在我们在莫斯科的逗留结束以后，我们目前的谈判会以我们尚待安排的方式继续进行。
