    Liang Shuming is a representative of the feudal landlord class in terms of his ideology. The years when he was active on the political stage were precisely the time when the Chinese people's revolutionary movement was booming and the feudal landlord class was declining. In order to save his class from its impending doom, Liang Shuming, under the guise of a "social educator," published some educational papers while also engaging in reactionary political activities. His educational thought is actually his political stance. Its content is: opposing the Communist Party, opposing the people's revolution led by the Party, promoting the feudal ethical spirit, and attempting to lay a solid rural base for the joint rule of imperialism, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists.

    Liang Shuming's proposal of a restorationist educational thought has its reactionary "theoretical" basis. He applied the viewpoint of historical idealism to exaggerate the role of subjective factors in social history, believing that culture (he refers to spiritual culture) is the decisive factor in society, thereby characterizing China's problems as merely a "cultural problem." He asserted that the root cause of the suffering of the people in old China was not the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, but China's own "cultural imbalance." From this, he believed that the way out for semi-colonial and semi-feudal China was not to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists through armed revolution, but the so-called "cultural transformation and national self-salvation." Therefore, he proposed that feudal ethical education must be implemented. He shouted at the top of his voice: "If Chinese society does not restore the inherent spirit of advocating etiquette and customs in the future... then the Chinese problem will never be solved, and Chinese society (should be Chinese feudal society - author) will still have no hope of restoration!" ("Collection of Rural Construction Papers," page 176.)

    At the same time, Liang Shuming also called Chinese feudalist education "emotional education" or "conduct education," and Western modern capitalist education "knowledge education." He believed that the difference between them lies in that "Western education focuses on the tools of life, while Chinese education focuses on life itself." He advocated that "emotional education is even more fundamental, which means that how to make life itself just right is the first question" ("Shu Ming Thirty Years Ago," page 188). Of course, the "Western education" he rejected did not include the reactionary educational thoughts of Western imperialism. For example, he once greatly praised Dewey. Here, his intention was to elevate Chinese feudal ethical education and degrade science. On this point, he himself said very clearly: "In the old days (referring to the time when Western-style education had not yet entered China)... education was roughly equivalent to the function of Western religion, its content being the lessons of life and not containing knowledge and skills at all." ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement," page 285) The purpose of this degrading of science is to promote feudal ignorance, so that the Chinese people will forever remain in a backward state or even return to the dark ages, so as to facilitate the arbitrary manipulation of the rulers. Not only that, but its purpose is also to actively oppose materialism and oppose communism. In "Danish Education and Our Education," he said: "Natural science cannot but be talked about; but the research of natural science is very easy to lead to materialism, which conflicts with their (referring to Gronweigh et al. - author) education." In fact, this is Liang Shuming's "confession." The "emotional education" advocated by Liang Shuming is also the reactionary education of feudal ethics represented by Confucius and Confucianism, with the so-called "righteousness" as the center to "transform the people into customs" of "education." Regarding the educational thought of Confucius and Confucianism, we will not make a comprehensive evaluation here. However, Liang Shuming quoted a sentence from "The Analects": "Eat without seeking satiety, live without seeking comfort, be diligent in work and cautious in speech, and go to those who have the Way to correct yourself." He tells people that not eating enough and living uncomfortably are secondary. The important thing is to use feudal ethics to demand oneself. He euphemistically says that this is "the upward demand of life." He regards Confucianism as "the elite of Chinese culture" and advocates to "popularize" "Confucian life" and "transform the common people."

    The content of the feudal ethical educational thought promoted by Liang Shuming is mainly "filial piety and brotherly love." This is because "filial piety and brotherly love" are a central tenet of Confucian ethics, and Chinese feudal rulers of all dynasties used it to paralyze the people and maintain their rule. In feudal society, so-called "filial piety and brotherly love" is entirely a one-sided requirement. According to this ethical proposition, people in the family clan must unconditionally obey the "elders," and in society they must be absolutely loyal to the rulers. Feudal society regards this one-sided relationship of obedience as the norm of people's morality. These norms are like many invisible ropes around people's necks, suffocating their freedom. Since the May Fourth Movement, people have called it "cannibalistic ethics," which is very appropriate. While vigorously promoting "filial piety and brotherly love," Liang Shuming also vigorously promoted "life of inward exertion." The so-called "inward exertion" means that everything must be "patiently endured" and "seeking oneself," to restrain oneself and blame oneself. This is precisely the spirit of "tolerance" advocated by Confucianism, a slave philosophy. Therefore, Liang Shuming believes that the primary problem for the people is "self-cultivation," that is, to temper oneself with feudal ethics, which is the so-called "making life itself just right." If everyone becomes a "perfect person" of feudal ethics, the feudal rulers can sit back and relax. Isn't it clearly stated in "The Analects": "If a person is filial and fraternal, few are those who like to offend their superiors, and those who do not like to offend their superiors but like to create chaos have never been seen." Liang Shuming vigorously advocated the restoration of feudal ethical education under the banner of "filial piety and brotherly love." His political purpose is so obvious! He attempted to use the feudal ethical spirit to train the Chinese people, especially the Chinese peasants, into "obedient" slaves, so that China would not erupt in revolution, and the rule of the declining feudal landlord class could "last forever." However, this is just the fantasy of a dying class, and the wheels of history are not allowed to be dragged backward.

    Not only that, but Liang Shuming also put forward the proposition of "unity of politics and education," which even more nakedly demonstrates the reactionary nature of his educational thought. Starting from the idealist view of history, Liang Shuming exaggerated the role of education. He fantasized about deceiving the people through the education of feudal ethics and implementing all measures by the ruling class to oppress the people. He believed that without education, politics and economics would be helpless. Therefore, he put forward the proposition of "unity of politics and education" and "governing politics with education," advocating that all work in society should be included in education and carried out and completed through education. He also proposed: "The state is a group with the highest power, it will give us many arrangements and many instructions. These many arrangements and many instructions should fully contain the educational significance of leading people to improve their lives and developing their morality and intelligence; this is the unity of politics and education." ("Rural Construction Theory," page 449) Liang Shuming's proposition is extremely vicious. Everyone knows that the state is originally a machine of class oppression, and the semi-feudal and semi-colonial Chinese state is the machine by which feudal landlords and bureaucratic capitalists oppress the broad masses of working people. However, Liang Shuming attempted to transform it into an educational institution that "leads people to improve their lives" and "develop their moral and intellectual intelligence," making it "become an educational group" to cover up the essence of the reactionary regime and blur the people's class consciousness. This is originally a replica of the ruling means of the feudal rulers of all dynasties who "make them rulers and teachers." His "unity of politics and education" thought is directly opposed to the people's revolution. He said: "At this time, education must stand in the first place in society, guiding everything in society with academic research; the social system can be continuously improved without the need for violent revolution." ("Rural Construction Theory," page 451) Here, the so-called "guiding society with academic research" is nothing more than using corrupt feudal theories to fool the people; the so-called "continuously improving" the social system is nothing more than using corrupt feudal ethics to "perfect" the reactionary rule. Therefore, the edge of all his reactionary remarks is aimed at the people's revolution, and his ultimate goal is to make the people spiritually slaves of the ruling class through feudal ethical education, so that there is "no need for violent revolution."

    As pointed out above, Liang Shuming fantasized about paralyzing the people through feudal ethical education in order to consolidate feudal rule and oppose the people's revolution. In order to realize this reactionary attempt, he also had a set of specific methods, namely: starting from "small-scale villages" and "starting," making the lower-level administrative organs of the Kuomintang regime "educational institutions." This is the rural agricultural school (also known as rural schools and village schools) that he ran in various parts of Shandong before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The rural agricultural school specifically embodies his restorationist, ignorant, and anti-revolutionary educational thought.

    The origin of the rural agricultural school is still the old trick of feudal society—the village covenant. He said: Running a rural agricultural school "is to learn from the ancients"; "this thing, the rural agricultural school, is a natural institution in the supplemented and reformed village covenant." ("Rural Construction Theory," page 215) He especially proposed the "Song and Ming Confucianists" and "Qing Dynasty government" who advocated the implementation of the "village covenant" as a reference. History shows that the village covenant of feudal society was originally an organizational form used by emperors, wealthy gentry, and landlords to resist peasant movements; thus, it can be seen that Liang Shuming's reactionary intention of "learning from the ancients" is self-evident.

    The rural agricultural school is a so-called "unity of politics, education, and health" organization, not a real school. Liang Shuming himself once said: "The rural agricultural school is both a social education and mass training institution, and also a lower-level administrative organ." ("Letter to Colleagues and Students in Shandong Rural Work") He attempted to promote all reactionary political measures through the feudal ethical education method. Therefore, the real work of the rural agricultural school is to replace local administrative agencies and train reactionary armed forces for the landlord class. He once admitted without concealment: "Since the implementation of the Zouping self-experimental plan, the former district offices, township offices, and other agencies have been abolished and replaced by village schools and township schools." ("Collection of Rural Construction Papers," page 105) It also said: "Because it is a lower-level administrative organ, all government orders are executed through this." ("Letter to Colleagues and Students in Shandong Rural Work") Thus, it can be seen that the rural agricultural school is nothing more than a change of signboard for the grassroots organization of the Kuomintang regime, and the reactionary essence of the regime has not changed in the slightest.

    According to Liang Shuming, there are three types of people who make up the rural agricultural school: one is rural leaders, the second is adult farmers, and the third is intellectuals who do rural movements. The rural agricultural school includes the principal, school board members, teachers, and students. The principal and school board members are all held by the so-called "rural leaders." The teachers are intellectuals who have received specialized training in "rural construction." The students include all farmers. Liang Shuming has always despised farmers, believing that "villagers are foolish and ignorant" and "rural people have limited knowledge" and are easy to deceive. At the same time, he also saw that farmers are numerous and a huge social force. Therefore, in order to resist the peasant revolutionary movement led by the Party and to compete with the Party for peasants, he took the peasants as the object of education and included all the farmers in each place in the rural agricultural school as "students." He advocated that the principal and school board members of the rural agricultural school (actually the lower-level administrative officials of the reactionary government) be held by rural leaders. In old China, the so-called rural leaders could only be wealthy gentry and landlords. However, Liang Shuming let these wealthy gentry and landlords who rode on the heads of the peasants preside over the rural agricultural school, respecting them all as "senior students" and "teachers." All "students" have the obligation to "respect senior students" and "cherish directors" and must unconditionally "accept the training of senior students." This is an attempt to cover up the bloody rule of the landlord class over the peasants with this "teacher-student relationship" in order to achieve the purpose of blurring the peasants' class consciousness and undermining the peasant revolutionary movement. On the surface, the rural agricultural school seems to be a group that "organizes the people" and "educates the people," "everyone gathers together," "discusses issues," and "thinks of solutions." However, tearing down the window dressing, this is just a technique of Liang Shuming's "organizing the countryside" "on the basis of gentle habits," which is also a "soft skill" he used to deceive the peasants.

    Liang Shuming stipulated a "curriculum" for the rural agricultural school in order to systematically conduct feudal ethical education and poison the minds of the masses. Among these "courses," there is a common and indispensable "homework" called "spiritual speech," also known as "spiritual pottery training." What is its purpose? He said: "The purpose of arranging this course is to save the spiritual bankruptcy of the countryside and let the villagers live." ("Liang Shuming's Education Papers," page 73) Liang Shuming called the development of the revolutionary situation at that time, which made the feudal order in the countryside precarious and the feudal ethical and moral concepts on the verge of collapse, "spiritual bankruptcy." He attempted to use the restorationist and ignorant "spiritual pottery training" to "save" this situation and to resist the development of the revolutionary situation at that time.

    Another work of the rural agricultural school is to train landlord armed forces. Liang Shuming called it "self-defense" and listed it as one of the homework of the rural agricultural school. The purpose of the so-called "self-defense" is to suppress and resist the peasant movement led by the Party at that time and consolidate the rule of the landlord class in the countryside. Therefore, the rural agricultural school is actually an agency for training landlord armed forces.

    From the rural agricultural school, we can see that the rural construction movement carried out by Liang Shuming is a movement that attempts to restore and consolidate the feudal ruling order. Liang Shuming began to engage in rural construction movement in Shandong around 1930. In this year, the Kuomintang reactionary government launched a counter-revolutionary armed encirclement and suppression of the revolutionary base areas; in coordination with this encirclement and suppression, it also launched an attack on the revolution in the cultural and ideological aspects. The Kuomintang government vigorously promoted a series of reactionary measures such as the "Baojia system," "local autonomy," "popular education," and "social education" at that time. This is Liang Shuming's so-called "social movement" that was "prevalent in all directions" and "everywhere." On the one hand, through his publications "Village Governance" and "Rural Construction," he promoted reactionary feudal restorationist ideas, openly opposing Marxism, science, and democracy; on the other hand, he also attempted to deceive the peasants in the name of "relieving the countryside," running rural agricultural schools to organize landlord armed forces to resist and suppress the peasant revolutionary movement led by the Party, and achieve the goal of "replacing the Communist Party" and "eliminating the Communist Party."

    Liang Shuming does not understand, nor is he willing to understand, that the objectively existing class contradictions cannot be resolved by bloody suppression, let alone erased by any ideological smokescreen or ignorant policies. In an antagonistic society, the contradictions between antagonistic classes can only be resolved by violent revolution; in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old Chinese society, the contradictions between the broad masses of the people and the three major enemies can only be resolved by the people's democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China. This is an objective law. Any subjective fantasy that violates objective laws, history proves, is destined to be shattered, and the bankruptcy of Liang Shuming's reactionary activities fully illustrates this point. In a speech "Our Two Major Difficulties" published in 1935, he had to admit that the "rural construction" he was engaged in was "called a rural movement but the countryside did not move." He said: "Now we are moving, but they (referring to the peasants) are not moving; not only are they not moving, but because we are moving, they are making a very inappropriate noise, almost making us unable to continue." The hardworking and brave Chinese peasants are not as "ignorant" as he imagined. Liang Shuming's counter-revolutionary activities are not only "unable to continue," but have been completely shattered by the power of the people.

    The above shows that Liang Shuming's most fundamental reactionary educational thought is the feudal restorationist educational thought. In addition to this, he also gathered some of the leftovers of the reactionary educational thought of Western imperialism to decorate himself and provide arguments for his feudal restorationist educational thought.

    For example, he vigorously praised pragmatic educational theory and said: "Dewey and I have mutual inventions"; "I am protecting Dewey." ("Liang Shuming's Education Papers," pages 7 and 10) According to Dewey's "education is life" and "education is society," he erased the class nature of education and proposed: "What is education? Everything is education. Reading in school is education; doing work at home is also education; good places among friends are education; the conversations of people on the street are also education; education is originally a very broad thing." ("Liang Shuming's Education Papers," page 191) Like Dewey, Liang Shuming used idealist views to exaggerate the role of education, believing that "all social progress must rely on education," and his intention was to attempt to use feudal ethical education to prevent revolution. He openly said: "If education can fulfill its function, in theory, there should be no more violent revolution in society." ("Liang Shuming's Education Papers," page 191) However, in order to make feudal ethical education achieve the function of preventing revolution, it is necessary to carry out deceptive propaganda to the broad masses of working people. Therefore, he cited Dewey's "democratic education" principle and advocated that the "life purpose" of "public purpose," "public tendency," and "public concept" be "transmitted to the wide range in space," advocating that "education is guidance, guiding people to the public; using public interests as a restricting element." ("Liang Shuming's Education Papers," page 24) In class society, the so-called "public interest" between antagonistic classes is purely deceiving. Liang Shuming's intention is to widely publicize this deceiving "public interest" among the broad masses of working people and use it as a criterion for measuring people's behavior, blurring the people's class consciousness, and making the people willingly endure the enslavement of the ruling class. This is the real purpose of his "popular education" and "rural agricultural school."

    Liang Shuming's educational thought and practice, like all his words and deeds, have consistently opposed revolution. In order to carry out the socialist revolution victoriously, we must resolutely oppose this reactionary educational thought and consolidate and expand the ideological position of Marxism-Leninism.

    批判梁漱溟的反动教育思想
    邹鲁风　李志逵　锺宇人　杨正典
    梁漱溟是封建地主阶级的思想代表。他在政治舞台上活跃的年代，正是中国人民革命运动蓬勃发展，封建地主阶级日薄西山的时候。为了挽救他所代表的阶级行将死亡的命运，梁漱溟打着“社会教育家”的招牌，发表过一些教育论文，同时致力于反动的政治活动。他的教育思想实际上就是他的政治主张，它的内容就是：反对共产党，反对党所领导的人民革命，宣扬封建伦理精神，企图为帝国主义、封建地主和官僚资产阶级的联合统治奠定一个牢靠的农村基地。
    梁漱溟提出复古主义的教育思想是有其反动的“理论”根据的。他应用唯心史观的观点夸大社会历史中主观因素的作用，认为文化（他所指的是精神文化）是社会的决定因素，从而把中国的问题说成只是一个“文化问题”。他断言旧中国的人民受苦受难的根源不是帝国主义和封建主义的压迫，而是中国自身的“文化失调”。由此他认为半殖民地半封建社会的中国的出路不是用武装革命推翻帝国主义、封建地主和官僚资产阶级的统治，而是所谓“文化改造、民族自救”。因此，他提出必须实施封建伦理教育。他力竭声嘶地喊叫：“今后中国社会如不恢复崇尚礼俗之固有精神……则中国问题永无解决之日，中国社会（按应作中国封建社会——作者）仍无匡复之期矣！”（“乡村建设论文集”，一七六页。）
    同时，梁漱溟还把中国封建主义教育称为“情志教育”或“行谊教育”，把西方近代资本主义教育称为“知识教育”。他认为它们之间的区别在于“西洋教育着意生活的工具，中国教育着意生活本身”。他主张“情志教育更是根本的，这就是说怎样要生活本身弄得恰好是第一个问题”（“漱溟卅前文录”，一八八页）。当然，他所排斥的“西洋教育”，并不包括西方帝国主义的反动教育思想在内。举例说，他就曾极力赞扬过杜威。这里，他的用意是在于抬高中国封建伦理教育，贬降科学。关于这一点，他自己说得很清楚：“在旧日（指西洋式教育未入中国之时）中国……教化盖与西洋之宗教略具相当功用，其内容为人生的教训而绝不含知识技能在内。”（“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”，二八五页）这种贬降科学的目的，就是要宣传封建蒙昧主义，使中国人永远停留在落后的状况或者甚至回复到中世纪的黑暗状态，以便于统治者的任意摆布。还不只此，其目的还在于积极地反对唯物主义，反对共产主义。他在“丹麦教育与我们的教育”中说：“自然科学是不能不讲的；但自然科学的研究很易导入唯物主义，与他们（指格龙维等——作者）的教育生冲突”。其实这正是梁漱溟的“夫子自道”。梁漱溟所提倡的“情志教育”，也就是以孔子儒家为代表的封建伦理的反动教育，以所谓“义理”为中心来“化民成俗”的“教化”。关于孔子儒家的教育思想，这里我们不作全面的评价。但是，梁漱溟引用了“论语”上一句话：“食无求饱，居无求安，敏于事而慎于言，就有道而正焉。”告诉人吃不饱，住不安是次要的，重要的是用封建伦理道德来要求自己，他美其名说这是“人生向上的要求”。他把儒家思想说成是“中国文化之精英”，主张把“孔子人生”加以“普及”，“化及平民”。
    梁漱溟所宣传的封建伦理教育思想的内容，主要的就是“孝悌之教”。这是因为“孝悌”是儒家伦理主张的一个中心，中国历代封建统治者正是利用它来麻痹人民和维护统治的。在封建社会里，所谓“孝悌”完全是片面的要求。按照这种伦理主张，人们在家庭宗族里要对“长者”无条件顺从，在社会上要对统治者绝对忠诚。封建社会把这种片面服从的关系作为人们道德的规范，这些规范就像许多无形的绳索勒在人们的脖子上，窒息着人们的自由。“五四”以来，人们把它称为“吃人的礼教”，这是非常恰当的。在极力宣扬“孝悌之教”的同时，梁漱溟并极力推崇“向里用力之人生”。所谓“向里用力”就是一切事情都要“逆来顺受”、“反求诸己”，要克制自己、责备自己。这正是儒家所提倡的“忍让”精神，奴隶哲学。因此梁漱溟认为，对人民说来，首要的问题是“修身”，就是用封建伦理道德陶冶自己，也就是所谓把“生活本身弄得恰好”。如果每个人都成了封建伦理道德的“完人”，封建统治者就可以高枕无忧了。“论语”上不是说得很明白吗：“其为人也孝悌，而好犯上者鲜矣，不好犯上而好作乱者，未之有也。”梁漱溟极力主张恢复以“孝悌”为标榜的封建伦理教育，他的政治目的就是这样地明显！他企图用封建伦理精神把中国人民尤其是中国农民训练成“唯命是从”的奴隶，这样，中国就不会爆发革命，日趋灭亡的封建地主阶级的统治也就可以“万古长存”了。然而，这不过是垂死阶级的幻想，历史的车轮是不容许拖向后退的。
    不仅如此，梁漱溟还提出“政教合一”的主张，这更露骨地表明了他的教育思想的反动性。从唯心史观出发，梁漱溟夸大了教育的作用。他幻想通过封建伦理道德的教育欺骗人民，贯彻统治阶级对人民进行压迫的一切措施。他认为没有教育，政治和经济都会毫无办法。因此他提出“政教合一”，“以教统政”的主张，主张把社会上的一切工作都包括到教育里面，通过教育来进行，完成。他还提出：“国家是有最高权力的团体，它将给我们许多安排、许多指示。这许多安排许多指示，应当充分寓有领导人生向上、发展人们德性智能的教育意义；这便是政教合一。”（“乡村建设理论”，四四九页）梁漱溟的这种主张是极其恶毒的。大家知道，国家本来是阶级压迫的机器，半封建半殖民地的中国国家就是封建地主和官僚资产阶级压迫广大劳动人民的机器。但是，梁漱溟企图把它改装成为“领导人生向上”、“发展人们德性智能”的教育机关，使之“成为一教育的团体”，来掩盖反动政权的实质，模糊人民的阶级意识。这原本是历代封建统治者“作之君、作之师”的统治手段的翻版。他的这种“政教合一”思想是直接反对人民革命的。他说：“此时教育必站在社会的第一位，以学术指导社会的一切；社会制度就可以不断地讲求改良，用不着暴力革命。”（“乡村建设理论”，四五一页）这里，所谓“以学术指导社会”，不过是用腐朽的封建理论来愚弄人民；所谓“不断地讲求改良”社会制度，也不过是用腐朽的封建伦理来“完善”反动统治。因此他的全部反动言论的锋芒是对准人民革命的，他的最终目的乃是通过封建伦理的教育，使人民在精神上成为统治阶级的奴隶，这样一来，就“用不着暴力革命”了。
    上面已经指出，梁漱溟幻想通过封建伦理教育来麻痹人民，达到巩固封建统治、反对人民革命的目的。为了实现这种反动的企图，他还有一套具体的办法，即：从“小范围的乡村”“入手”，把国民党政权的下级行政机关“教育机关化”。这就是他抗战前在山东各地所办的乡农学校（又称乡学村学）。乡农学校具体体现了他的复古愚民、反对革命的教育思想。
    乡农学校的渊源仍旧是封建社会的老把戏——乡约。他说：办乡农学校“正是要师法古人”；“乡农学校这个东西，是补充改造后的乡约中自然要有的机关”。（“乡村建设理论”，二一五页）他特别提出提倡实行“乡约”的“宋明儒者”和“清朝政府”来作为借鉴。历史说明，封建社会的乡约原本是帝王、豪绅地主用来对抗农民运动的组织形式；由此可见，梁漱溟“师法古人”的用意之反动是不言而喻的了。
    乡农学校是所谓“政教卫合一”的组织，并非什么真的学校。梁漱溟自己曾说：“乡农学校一面为社会教育民众训练机关，一面又为下级行政机关。”（“告山东乡村工作同人同学书”）他企图用封建伦理教育的方式来推行一切反动的政治措施。因此，乡农学校的真正工作是代替地方行政机构，并给地主阶级训练反动武装。他曾经直认不讳地说：“邹平自实验计划施行后，已将从前之区公所乡镇公所等机关取消，而代以村学乡学。”（“乡村建设论文集”，一○五页）又说：“以其为下级行政机关，一切政令均借此而执行”。（“告山东乡村工作同人同学书”）由此可见，乡农学校不过是给国民党政权的基层组织换上了一牌招牌，政权的反动实质是丝毫没有改变的。
    根据梁漱溟的说法，组成乡农学校的成分共有三种人：一是乡村领袖，二是成年农民，三是作乡村运动的知识分子。乡农学校包括校长、校董、教员和学众。校长和校董都由所谓“乡村领袖”担任，教员是受过“乡村建设”专门训练的知识分子，学众包括全体农民。梁漱溟一贯蔑视农民，认为“乡民愚迷”，“乡村人知识短浅”，容易欺骗。同时，他也看到农民人数众多，是一个巨大的社会力量。因此，为了抵制党所领导的农民革命运动，以及同党争取农民，他把农民作为教育对象，把每个地方的全体农民都包括到乡农学校作为“学众”。他主张乡农学校的校长、校董（实际上就是反动政府的下级行政官吏）由乡村领袖担任。在旧中国所谓乡村领袖就只能是豪绅地主，但是，梁漱溟让这些骑在农民头上的豪绅地主来主持乡农学校，一律尊为“学长”、“老师”，全体“学众”都有“尊敬学长”、“爱惜董事”的义务，并且要无条件的“接受学长的训饬”。这就是企图用这种“师生关系”把地主阶级对农民的血腥统治掩盖起来，以达到模糊农民阶级意识、破坏农民革命运动的目的。表面上，乡农学校仿佛是一个“组织民众”、“教育民众”的集团，“大家聚合”、“讨论问题”、“想出办法”。但是，拆穿西洋镜，这不过是梁漱溟“组织乡村”“于柔性习惯之上”的一种手法，也就是他用来欺骗农民的一种“软功夫”罢了。
    梁漱溟给乡农学校规定了“课程”，以便系统地进行封建伦理教育，毒害群众的意识。这些“课程”中有一门共同的不可少的“功课”，叫做“精神讲话”，又名“精神陶炼”。其目的是什么呢？他说：“安排此一课程的目的，就在救济乡村精神的破产，让乡下人活起来。”（“梁漱溟教育论文集”，第七三页）梁漱溟把当时革命形势的发展使得农村里封建秩序摇摇欲坠、封建伦理道德观念濒于崩溃的情况称之为“精神的破产”、企图用复古愚民的“精神陶炼”来“挽救”这一情况，来对抗当时革命形势的发展。
    乡农学校的另一工作是训练地主武装，梁漱溟把它称为“自卫”，并把它列为乡农学校的功课之一。所谓“自卫”的目的就是镇压和对抗当时党所领导的农民运动，巩固地主阶级在农村中的统治。因此，乡农学校实际上也就是训练地主武装的机关。
    从乡农学校可以看到梁漱溟所搞的乡村建设运动就是企图恢复和巩固封建统治秩序的运动。梁漱溟是一九三○年左右开始在山东搞乡村建设运动的。这一年，国民党反动政府发动了对革命根据地的反革命武装围剿；配合这一围剿，在文化思想方面也向革命展开了进攻。国民党政府当时大力推行“保甲制度”、“地方自治”、“民众教育”和“社会教育”等一系列反动措施，这就是梁漱溟所谓的“四面八方”、“各地盛行”的“社会运动”。而梁漱溟所搞的乡村建设运动就是其中的一个主流。他一面通过他所主编的刊物“村治”和“乡建”，宣传反动的封建复古思想，公开反对马克思主义，反对科学、民主；另一方面还企图以“救济乡村”为名，兴办乡农学校来欺骗农民，组织地主武装，抵制和镇压党所领导的农民革命运动，达到“代替共产党”、“消灭共产党”的目的。
    梁漱溟不了解，也不愿意去了解客观存在着的阶级矛盾既不能用血腥镇压来解决，更不是任何思想烟幕或愚民政策可以抹煞的。在对抗性社会中，对抗阶级之间的矛盾只有暴力革命才能加以解决；在半封建半殖民地的旧中国社会里，人民大众和三大敌人之间的矛盾只有中国共产党领导的人民民主革命才能加以解决，这是客观的规律。任何违反客观规律的主观主义的幻想，历史证明是注定要破灭的，梁漱溟的反动活动的破产就充分说明了这一点。他在一九三五年发表的一篇“我们的两大难处”讲演中，不得不承认他搞的“乡村建设”是“号称乡村运动而乡村不动”。他说：“现在是我们动，他们（按指农民）不动；他们不惟不动，甚且因为我们动，反来和他们闹得很不合适，几乎让我们作不下去”。勤劳勇敢的中国农民并不是像他所设想的那样“蚩蚩无知”。梁漱溟的反革命活动不只是“作不下去”，而是已经被人民的力量所彻底粉碎了。
    以上说明了梁漱溟最根本的反动教育思想是封建复古主义的教育思想。除此之外，他还摭拾了一些西方帝国主义的反动教育思想的唾余来装饰自己，并给他的封建复古主义教育思想作论证。
    例如，他极力颂扬实用主义教育学说，并且说：“杜威与我有互相发明处”；“我是袒护杜威的”。（“梁漱溟教育论文集”，第七、十页）根据杜威的“教育即生活”，“教育即社会”，他抹煞了教育的阶级性，提出：“什么是教育？统同是教育。在学校里读书是教育；在家庭里做活也是教育；朋友中相得的地方是教育；街上人的谈话，亦莫不是教育；教育本来是很宽泛的东西。”（“梁漱溟教育论文集”，一九一页）和杜威一样，梁漱溟用唯心论的观点来夸大教育的作用，认为“社会的一切进步，固不能不有赖于教育”，其用意就在企图利用封建伦理教育来防止革命。他公开这样说：“如果教育能尽其功用，论理说社会上不应当再有暴力革命。”（“梁漱溟教育论文集”，一九一页）但是，为了使封建伦理教育达到防止革命的功用，必须对广大劳动人民进行欺骗宣传。因此，他援引杜威的“民本主义教育”原则，主张将“公共目的”、“公共倾向”、“公共观念”的“生活目的经过空间上往宽广里传达”，提倡“教育即指导，指导人往公共那里去；以公共利益作为制裁的要素”。（“梁漱溟教育论文集”，第二四页）在阶级社会中，对抗阶级之间的所谓“公共利益”纯粹是骗人的，梁漱溟的用意是在广大劳动群众中间广泛宣传这种骗人的“公共利益”，用它来作为衡量人们行为的标准，模糊人民的阶级意识，使人民甘心忍受统治阶级奴役。这就是他所推行的“民众教育”、“乡农学校”的真实目的。
    梁漱溟的教育思想和实践，像他的全部言行一样，是一贯反对革命的。为了胜利地进行社会主义革命，我们必须坚决反对这一反动的教育思想，巩固和扩大马克思列宁主义的思想阵地。
