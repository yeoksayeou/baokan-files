Since mid-July, the vast rural areas of Hebei Province have universally launched a summer and autumn patriotic hygiene campaign in conjunction with production. According to incomplete statistics so far, 320,590,000 tons of garbage have been removed, 81,058 tons of fertilizer accumulated, and more than 1 million jin of weeds cleared. During the patriotic hygiene campaign, the masses in various places also actively caught mosquitoes and flies, filled in pits and puddles, and repaired streets, which improved the environmental hygiene of rural areas.

Many areas combined hygiene with production and fertilizer accumulation. In Xiaomi Village, Panshan District, Ji County, the streets used to be very dirty. After cleaning, 240-plus cartloads of green manure were compressed, which could supply all the fertilizer needed by the village's two agricultural production cooperatives. The Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shizhuang Township, Jingxing County, regarded fertilizer accumulation as an investment by its members in the cooperative, which encouraged the members' enthusiasm for clearing garbage. In ten days, they cleared more than 1,600 dan of garbage. One hundred and eighty agricultural production cooperatives in Wen'an County improved the feeding and management of draught animals, established a system of applying soil to the draught animal sheds once a day and cleaning them every five days, and cleaned thirty-two pigpens, removing twenty-five large carts of manure.

Many villages have also repaired streets and leveled pits and puddles. The masses in various places also actively caught flies. The Mazhanyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guxin Township, She County, caught twenty-one jin of flies and repaired thirty-eight toilets in seven days.

    河北农村夏季卫生运动有成绩
    河北省广大农村自七月中旬起结合生产普遍开展了夏秋季爱国卫生运动。到目前不完全的统计，清除垃圾三亿二千零五十九万吨，积肥八万一千零五十八吨，清除杂草一百多万斤。各地群众在爱国卫生运动中还积极捕打蚊虫和苍蝇，填垫坑洼，修整街道，使农村的环境卫生得到改善。
    许多地区把卫生和生产积肥等工作结合起来进行。蓟县盘山区小米庄村，过去街上很不清洁，经过清扫，压成绿肥二百四十多车，可供给这村两个农业生产合作社所需的全部肥料。井陉县柿庄乡明星农业生产合作社，把积肥作为社员向社的投资，鼓舞了社员清除垃圾的热情，十天的工夫就清除垃圾一千六百多担。文安县的一百八十个农业生产合作社改善了耕畜的饲养管理，建立了耕畜棚每天垫土一次、五天清除一次的制度，并清了三十二个猪圈，起粪二十五大车。
    许多村庄还修整了街道，垫平了坑洼积水的地方。各地群众还积极捕打苍蝇。涉县固新乡马占元农业生产合作社在七天中捕蝇二十一斤，修补厕所三十八个。
