Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The newly built state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory officially began production on the 16th.

    The factory's equipment is fully automated. All spindles and looms are manufactured in China. The five sets of single-process cotton openers in the cotton cleaning workshop are the first new products manufactured by the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, modeled after the latest Soviet-style cotton openers. Each part of this cotton opener can operate automatically, making it twice as efficient as ordinary cotton openers. It uses an exhaust method to discharge dust and debris through a dust filter, producing exceptionally white and uniform laps. The cotton opener is also equipped with a waste cotton processing machine, which can process and reuse the waste cotton from each workshop. The three single-process roving frames are manufactured by the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory. This machine has a drafting capacity more than four times higher than ordinary roving frames.
    At the opening ceremony held today, more than 100 people attended to congratulate and visit the factory, including Jiang Guangnai, Minister of Textile Industry, Zhang Qinqiu, Vice Minister, Soviet expert Bliuhen, Chen Peng, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Jia Tingsan, Deputy Mayor of Beijing. Farmer representatives also braved the heavy rain to come from afar to congratulate. Farmer representative Zhao Wensheng said happily: I participated in the opening ceremony of the first cotton textile factory in the capital before National Day last year, and this year I participated in the opening ceremony of the second cotton textile factory before National Day. We must work hard to increase production to support the industrial construction of the motherland.

    国营北京第二棉纺织厂开工生产
    新华社十六日讯  新建的国营北京第二棉纺织厂在十六日正式开工生产。
    这个工厂的设备都是自动化的。全部纱锭和全部织布机，都是我国自己制造的。清花车间的五套单程式清花机，是国营郑州纺织机械厂仿照苏联最新型的清花机式样制造的第一批新产品。这种清花机各个部分都能自动运转，比一般清花机效率高一倍。它利用排气方法将尘屑由滤尘器排出，生产的花卷特别洁白均匀。清花机上还装有回花机，可以把各车间的回花加工后再使用。三道单程粗纱机是国营天津纺织机械厂制造的。这种机器比普通粗纱机牵伸能力高四倍以上。
    在今日举行的开工典礼会上，到厂祝贺、参观的有纺织工业部长蒋光鼐、副部长张琴秋、苏联专家布留亨、中国共产党北京市委员会副书记陈鹏、北京市副市长贾庭三等共一百多人。农民代表们也冒着大雨从远道赶来祝贺。农民代表赵文盛高兴地说：我去年国庆节前参加了首都第一个棉纺织厂的开工典礼，今年又在国庆节前参加了第二个棉纺织厂的开工典礼。我们一定要努力增产来支援祖国的工业建设。
