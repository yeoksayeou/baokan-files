Shanghai Children's Palace, operated by the China Welfare Institute, is a cultural paradise for children in Shanghai. Scientific and cultural activities are extremely rich in the Children's Palace. Children have established groups for motor engineering, airplane models, shipbuilding, radio, biology, photography, fine arts, embroidery, and the Children's Amateur Art Troupe. All activities of the Children's Palace closely cooperate with the school's teaching work, helping children broaden their horizons, enrich their knowledge, increase their interest in learning, develop their wisdom and creativity, and cultivate them to become a new generation of socialist all-round development.
