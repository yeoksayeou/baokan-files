    In the Season of Harvest
    Highest Cotton Production in Hubei Since Liberation
    Hubei Province's cotton production this year will be the highest since liberation. The province's more than 8.5 million mu of cotton fields are expected to yield more than 2.57 million dan of ginned cotton, with an average yield of 30.3 jin per mu, exceeding the planned yield and surpassing the bumper harvest of 1953 by 1.8 jin. Farmers have already begun picking new cotton.
    Hubei Province's local cotton varieties had low yields and short fibers. After the severe floods last year, the state transferred more than 17 million jin of improved cotton seeds from Jiangsu, Hebei, and other provinces to vigorously promote them in Hubei's cotton-producing areas, which played a significant role in increasing cotton production. In Jingzhou Prefecture, located in the Jianghan Plain, most cotton fields were replanted with improved cotton seeds, achieving a unit yield of more than 38 jin. This year, Hubei Province also implemented pink bollworm quarantine work in more than 1.34 million mu of cotton areas in eight counties, including Jianli and Hanchuan. These areas had exceptionally high cotton yields due to the scarcity of pink bollworm infestations; Hanchuan County's average unit yield will be nearly 42 jin. To consolidate and expand this achievement, the provincial agricultural departments are emphasizing seed selection and preservation while harvesting cotton. Various pink bollworm quarantine areas are also strengthening overwintering prevention work. (Yuan Jun)
    Cotton Fields in Jiangxi Generally Yield More Than Last Year
    The more than 800,000 mu of cotton planted in Jiangxi Province this year generally have more than ten layers of fruit branches, bearing 30 to 40 cotton bolls. Most of the mature cotton bolls are splitting and releasing cotton. The 28 cotton-growing counties have generally begun harvesting the first flush of cotton. Counties such as Leping, Yugan, Poyang, and Jinxian have finished harvesting the first flush and are now picking the second, with individual areas harvesting the third. Cotton yields in various counties are generally about 10% higher than last year. The Wen Jinzhu Agricultural Cooperative in Jiujiang County harvested 265 jin per mu of cotton fields, 30 jin more than in the past. More than 70,000 mu of cotton fields in Poyang County have all increased production compared to last year. The ten mu of cotton land planted by the Minle Agricultural Cooperative in Leting Township is estimated to yield an average of 500 jin of seed cotton per mu, about 30% higher than last year. Currently, in addition to vigorously leading cotton farmers to pick more frost-resistant cotton, various localities are also mobilizing cotton farmers to continue to do a good job of cotton field management and topdressing fertilizer, striving for a greater harvest.

    Datong Lake Farm Achieves First Large-Scale Bumper Harvest
    The state-owned Datong Lake Farm in Hunan Province, located on the shores of Dongting Lake, has achieved its first large-scale bumper harvest of 5,000 mu of double-cropping early rice and more than 30,000 mu of mid-season rice since the farm was established. The average yield of double-cropping early rice is 635 jin per mu, and the average yield of mid-season rice is 700 jin per mu, an average increase of more than 20% compared to 1953. Among them, 2,000 mu of double-cropping rice can strive to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin.
    Datong Lake Farm was submerged by floods last year. Since the beginning of spring, under the leadership of the Party, all 3,000 employees of the farm have carried out intense farm restoration and preparation work. They actively reclaimed wasteland, drained the lake, and plowed the land; then, they launched a tenacious struggle against cold waves, wind, rain, waterlogging, and the drought of the past two months. Thanks to such continuous efforts, they have won this year's bumper harvest.
    Encouraged by the bumper harvest, all farm employees are stepping up the cultivation of nearly 10,000 mu of double-cropping late rice, striving for another bumper harvest.

    Replacing Sorghum with Corn Increases Production by Nearly Double
    Nearly 100,000 mu of corn replanted in Taixian County, Jiangsu Province, this year has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest, with an average yield of about 300 jin per mu, an increase of 80% compared to sorghum on the same land, and in some cases, more than double. Farmers in Taixian County were not accustomed to growing corn in the past. This year, in order to implement the yield increasing measure of "replacing low-yield crops with high-yield crops," 195 agricultural production cooperatives and 5,000 mutual aid teams took the lead in replanting nearly 100,000 mu of sorghum land with corn. Due to proper fertilization, pest control, and weeding in field management, a large-scale increase in corn production was achieved. The Guanzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baiguan Township, Dalun District, replanted 65 mu of corn this year, with an average yield of 500 jin per mu. The Baoding Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xia Zhu District planted 50 mu of corn, with an average yield of 710 jin per mu. The 27 mu of corn intercropped in soybean fields also yielded an average of 300 jin per mu.
    Now, encouraged by the yield-increasing measure of "replacing low-yield crops with high-yield crops," farmers are actively selecting and saving seeds, preparing to expand the replanting area next year.
    Unprecedented Bumper Harvest of Rice in Yanbian Area
    Rice in the Yanbian area of Jilin Province is showing signs of a bumper harvest. The Xinfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changbai Township, Yanji County, can harvest more than 10,000 jin per hectare on its 119 hectares of paddy fields. The Nangguanghao rice in the local state-run farm in Hunchun County can produce 13,000 jin per hectare. Rice in the mountainous areas of Wangqing, Antu and other counties is also showing signs of an unprecedented bumper harvest. Dongming Village in the Second District of Antu County is a mountain village. In the past, the farmers in this village had shed countless sweat on that cold, infertile land, but had never achieved ideal yields. This year's rice is growing thick and uniform, and now large tracts of paddy fields are a golden yellow. The farmers excitedly discussed: I didn't expect our mountain ditch to grow such good crops.
    The reason for the unprecedented bumper harvest of rice in the Yanbian area is the great development of cooperativization. This year, 52.6 percent of farmers in Yanbian have joined cooperatives. Extensive cooperative organizations and the collectivist ideology of the farmers who are growing up in the cooperativization movement have overcome the difficulties that individual farmers and mutual aid group farmers cannot overcome. For example, the Donghe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuanghe Township, Wangqing County, was a mutual aid group in 1952. Although that year was the best year, the unit area yield per hectare did not exceed 7,000 jin. This year, the members covered more than 30 hectares of paddy fields with manure, improved the soil, and changed the old habit of broadcasting seeds that had existed for decades, and carried out dense planting of rice seedlings on 80% of the cultivated area. On that same piece of land, an unprecedented record of 8,500 jin per unit area will be created.
    Rice Production Increases in Tangyan Irrigation Area of Changshou County
    More than 70,000 mu of rice in the Tangyan and reservoir irrigation areas built in Changshou County, Sichuan, have achieved a bumper harvest. Generally, production has increased by more than 20% compared to last year, exceeding this year's planned production target; compared with non-irrigated areas, the harvest is generally about 10% more. The Tangyan irrigation area in the hillside areas has the largest increase in production. Farmers Zhou Zishan and Yang Sanfu in Jingling Township produced 14 shi and 3 dou of yellow rice from 13 shi and 2 dou of land, an increase of 55% compared to last year. It is estimated that the county has increased production by more than 7,000 shi of yellow rice due to Tangyan and reservoir irrigation.
    There was a drought in Changshou County during the spring plowing this year, and Tangyan and reservoirs continuously released water to the irrigation area, ensuring the timely spring plowing and transplanting of 1/8 of the county's farmland (more than 70,000 mu). Most of the irrigation areas also achieved shallow water transplanting and irrigation. In the dammed fields of Qilin, Linfeng and other townships, in previous years, people were afraid of drought and often kept very deep water, which made the fields infertile; the planted seedlings were also difficult to take root and did not grow well. This year, with the guarantee of Tangyan, shallow water transplanting and shallow water irrigation were achieved, and the crops grew particularly strong. The fields on the hillside of Muer and Jingling Townships in the ninth district originally suffered from drought if it did not rain for ten days, and the applied fertilizer often lost its effect as a result. Now, these places have built Tangyan, and the fields are constantly watered, and the crops are growing normally, and the fertilizer has also fully exerted its effect. In the past, the alluvial fields in San Village, Shuanglong Township, were often washed away by heavy rains, and the mud covered the crops. This year, there were constant heavy rains in July and August, but with the regulation of a large Tang, the field ridges and crops were not damaged, and the irrigation areas such as alluvial fields, hillside fields, and dammed fields all had great harvests.
    Farmers generally reflected that building water conservancy projects is a good way to increase production, and demanded that they continue to be built. The county also decided to complete water conservancy projects to increase the irrigation of 50,000 mu of farmland this winter and next spring to ensure a larger area of production increase in the future.

    在丰收的季节里
    解放后湖北棉产量最高的一年
    湖北省棉花产量今年将是解放以来最高的一年。全省八百五十多万亩棉田，预计可以收皮棉二百五十七万多担；单位面积平均产量三十点三市斤，超过了计划产量，比棉花丰收的一九五三年还高一点八市斤。现在，农民已经开始拣收新棉。
    湖北省本地棉种产量低、纤维短。去年遭受特大洪水以后，国家由江苏、河北等省调拨了一千七百多万斤改良棉种，在湖北省棉产区大力推广，这对提高棉花产量起了极大作用。处在江汉平原的荆州专区，大部棉田换种了改良棉种，单位产量达到三十八市斤多。今年，湖北省还在监利、汉川等八个县的一百三十四万多亩棉区内实行了红铃虫检疫工作，这些地区因为极少发现红铃虫害，棉花产量特高，汉川县的单位平均产量就将近四十二市斤。为了巩固和扩大这一成果，省农业部门在收花同时，强调作好选种保种工作。各红铃虫检疫区也在加强越冬防治工作。　（袁　军）
    江西棉田普遍比去年增产
    江西省今年种植的八十多万亩棉花，一般都长有十多层果枝，结棉铃三十到四十个，成熟的棉铃大部都在开裂吐絮。二十八个植棉县普遍开始收第一次花，乐平、余干、鄱阳、进贤等县已收完第一次，正接着采摘第二次，个别地区在收第三次花。各县棉花普遍较去年增产百分之十左右，九江县文金珠农业社棉田每亩收到二百六十五斤，比过去多收三十斤。鄱阳县七万多亩棉田都比去年增产。乐亭乡民乐农业社种的十亩棉地，估计平均每亩收籽棉五百斤，约比去年增产百分之三十。目前各地除大力领导棉农多采摘霜前花外，还发动棉农继续做好棉田加工追肥，争取更大丰收。

    大通湖农场第一次大面积丰收
    湖南洞庭湖畔的国营大通湖农场今年种植的五千亩双季早稻和三万多亩中稻获得建场以来第一次大面积丰收。双季早稻每亩平均产量六百三十五斤，中稻每亩平均产量七百斤。平均较一九五三年增产二成以上。其中有二千亩双季稻，并能争取达到千斤丰产。
    大通湖农场去年曾被洪水淹没，开春以来，全场三千职工，在党的领导下，进行了紧张的复场、备耕工作。积极开荒、排湖、犁地；随后又向寒流风雨、渍水和近两月来的旱灾展开了顽强斗争，由于这样不断的努力，才赢得了今年的大丰收。
    在丰收的鼓舞下，全场职工又在加紧培育近一万亩的双季晚稻等，争取再获丰收。

    高粱地改种玉米增产近一倍
    江苏泰县今年改种的近十万亩玉米获得大面积丰收，平均每亩收三百斤左右，比同等土地的高粱要增产八成，高的达一倍以上。泰县农民过去不习惯种玉米，今年贯彻“低产改高产”的增产措施，由一百九十五个农业生产合作社和五千个互助组带头将近十万亩高粱地改种玉米。由于进行合理施肥、治虫、除草等田间管理工作，得到玉米大面积增产。大埨区拜官乡官庄农业生产合作社今年改种六十五亩玉米，每亩平均产量五百斤。夏朱区包丁农业生产合作社种五十亩玉米，平均每亩收七百一十斤。间种在黄豆田里的二十七亩玉米，平均每亩也收到三百斤。
    现在农民受到“低产改高产”增产措施的鼓舞，正积极进行选种留种，准备明年扩大改种面积。
    延边地区水稻空前丰收
    吉林省延边地区的水稻呈现出丰收景象。延吉县长白乡新丰农业生产合作社的一百一十九垧水田，每垧平均能打一万多斤。珲春县地方国营农场南光号水稻每垧可产一万三千斤。汪清、安图等县山区的水稻也呈现出空前的丰收景象。安图县第二区东明村是个山村，过去这村的农民们，在那冷浆的土地上不知流了多少汗水，但都没有收过理想的产量。今年的水稻长得又粗壮、又整齐，现在大片大片的水田里全是一片金黄色。农民们兴奋地议论说：没想到我们这山沟能长这么好的庄稼。
    延边地区水稻空前丰收的原因是合作化的大发展。今年，延边有百分之五十二点六的农户参加了合作社。广泛的合作社组织和在合作化运动中正在成长着的农民的集体主义思想，克服了个体农民和互助组农民所克服不了的困难。如：汪清县双河乡东和农业生产合作社一九五二年是个互助组，那年虽是个最好的年头，每垧单位面积产量也没有超过七千斤。今年社员们在三十多垧水田上铺满了粪，改良了土壤，改变了几十年来的旧习惯——散播的作法，在百分之八十的耕地面积上进行了密植插秧。就在过去那同一块土地上创造了单位面积产量将能达到八千五百斤的空前纪录。
    长寿县塘堰灌区水稻增产
    四川长寿县兴修的塘、堰和水库灌区内的七万多亩水稻获得丰收。一般比去年增产二成以上，超过了今年计划产量指标；同非灌区比较，一般约多收获一成。山坡地带塘堰灌区增产最多，精灵乡农民周自善和杨三福两户，十三石二斗田，共产了黄谷十四石三斗，比去年增产五成半。估计全县因塘、堰和水库灌溉而增产了七千多石黄谷。
    长寿县今年春耕中曾发生过旱象，塘、堰、水库就不断地向灌区放水，保证了全县八分之一的农田（即七万多亩）适时的春耕和栽秧。绝大部分灌区还做到了浅水栽秧和灌溉。麒麟、邻封等乡的坝田，往年怕天干，经常关着很深的水，瘦了田；栽下的秧子又很难落根，生长得不好。今年有了塘堰做保证，做到了浅水浅栽和浅水灌溉，庄稼格外茁壮了。九区木耳、精灵等乡山坡上的田，原来十天不下雨就要闹旱，施下的肥料，也常因此失掉了作用。现在这些地方兴修了塘、堰，田中经常不断水，庄稼一直正常地成长，肥料也充分发挥了效用。双龙乡三村的冲田，年年都遭大雨冲垮很多田坎，泥糊倒庄稼。今年七、八月份不断下大雨，但有了一口大塘的调节，田坎和庄稼都没有受损失，不论冲田、坡田或坝田等灌区都大大丰收了。
    农民们普遍反映兴修水利是增加生产的好办法，要求继续兴修。全县也决定今冬明春再完成增灌五万亩农田的水利工程，以保证今后更大面积的增产。
