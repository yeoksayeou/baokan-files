Xinjiang is about to complete the harvest of its oil crops.

This year, oil crops in most parts of Xinjiang are growing very well. The Aksu region south of the Tianshan Mountains has seen a general bumper harvest of oil crops. Among them, Baicheng County's more than 69,000 mu of rapeseed can yield an average of more than 150 jin per mu, and the nearly 90,000 mu of flax that is about to be harvested is estimated to yield an average of more than 90 jin per mu. Flax in the Shache region can yield an average of 84 jin per mu. The rapeseed that has already been harvested in the Ili region north of the Tianshan Mountains can yield an average of 150 jin per mu. The planted flax is estimated to yield an average of 120 jin per mu.

This year, the area of oil crops planted by farmers in various parts of Xinjiang exceeded the original plan by approximately 200,000 mu. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆省种植的油料作物就要收割完了。
