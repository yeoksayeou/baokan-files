Implementing the Grain "Three Fixes" Policy to the Household

It is imperative to correctly implement the policy
Zhang Gengsheng, Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Yuebei District Committee

    The work of fixing grain production, purchase, and sales in Yuebei District began in mid-June and was rolled out across the entire district. By the time of the summer harvest, all but 30 of the district's 1,959 townships (excluding minority townships) had assessed the production, purchase, and sales tasks down to the household level, and 405 townships had undergone review. In the "Three Fixes" work, most areas have generally been able to implement the policies, taking a major step forward in the institutionalization of grain work. According to statistics from 318 townships in nine counties, the fixed purchase volume decreased by more than 20% compared to 1954, and the fixed sales volume decreased by 37.5% compared to 1954. Most areas have an average annual grain retention of 450 to 500 jin per person, and counties like Qujiang and Renhua can reach 550 jin. On average, each farmer retained 50 to 60 jin more grain than last year. The "Three Fixes" has also greatly promoted current production and further enhanced the production enthusiasm of farmers. In Yangshan County's Second District, the "Three Fixes" resulted in overfulfilling the task of rushing to plant 19,000 mu of sweet potatoes and opening up more than 4,000 mu of wasteland. Yingde County launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign alongside the "Three Fixes" work, accumulating a total of 4 million dan of fertilizer across the county. From this year's summer planting to August 15th, Yuebei District basically completed rice transplanting. All of these have created favorable conditions for the great development of agricultural cooperation.

    However, because the "Three Fixes" is a new task, and both staff and the masses lack experience, and their understanding of the guidelines and policies was not deep or clear enough at the beginning, the achievements of the "Three Fixes" work cannot be overestimated. Based on the results of inspections of policy implementation in various regions and the situation revealed in recent expanded cadre meetings in various counties, there are still relatively serious problems in the "Three Fixes" work. The most important is that the distribution of purchase and sales figures is not entirely reasonable, especially the phenomenon of being too lenient or too harsh between households. Yangshan is a county where the "Three Fixes" work has been done relatively well, but townships where the "Three Fixes" was truly well done and 90% of the masses were satisfied accounted for only a quarter of the county's total number of townships. Townships where 20% to 30% of the masses had opinions accounted for half of the county's total number of townships, and townships with many outstanding problems accounted for a quarter. From the townships that have already been reviewed, the households whose grain purchase and sales figures need to be adjusted generally account for about 20% of the total number of households. For example, in Sanjia Township, Qingyuan County, out of a total of 472 households, 35 households had their fixed purchase tasks increased, and 62 households had their fixed purchase tasks decreased after review; 12 households had their fixed sales tasks increased, and 8 households had their fixed sales tasks decreased. The number of adjusted households accounted for 24.78% of the township's total number of households. Nanxiong County has already undergone the "Three Fixes" review, but during the summer requisition and purchase, it was discovered that there were still 5% of households whose purchase and sales figures were not reasonable enough, so a second review and adjustment was carried out. Secondly, many areas did not do a good job in planning monthly supply during fixed sales.

    Why did this situation occur? This is primarily because some staff members do not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of the "Three Fixes," and have a one-sided task-oriented view and a mentality of emphasizing purchase over sales. Some staff members simply calculated purchases based on output, and the fixed output was very unreasonable (the whole township was estimated using the increased production rate of one or two households); some staff members blindly increased output in order to complete the task; individual staff members in Xinfeng County even mistakenly proposed the principle of "output obeying the task," without paying attention to referring to the actual situation of purchase and sales last year, or simply allocated this year's purchase and sales figures based on last year's purchase and sales figures (which had many unreasonable aspects); some staff members did not promote democracy or follow the mass line after announcing the tasks, so that some farmers with better production conditions (mainly middle peasants) did not sell enough of their surplus grain, while farmers with poorer production conditions (poor peasants and elderly, weak, orphaned, and impoverished households) sold more grain than the surplus limit. Because there are many shortcomings in the "Three Fixes" work, production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement have been affected to a certain extent. In Shazhou Township, Lechang County, nine out of the thirteen households in the mutual aid group led by Deputy Township Head Chen Laijiao wanted to withdraw from the group, which was caused by the unreasonable distribution of purchase and sales figures. Secondly, because some area staff simply adjusted and distributed tasks based on figures, ignoring the in-depth and extensive publicity and education work, some farmers' thinking of obeying the state plan was not well established after the "Three Fixes," some farmers' understanding of the "Three Fixes" policy was still insufficient, not knowing how their assigned tasks were calculated, and some farmers even held the wrong idea of "selling less and retaining more."

    The above-mentioned situations exist in varying degrees in various regions. This fully illustrates the complexity and arduousness of the "Three Fixes" to the household work. It must be recognized that thoroughly doing the "Three Fixes" work and realizing the institutionalization of the unified purchase and sale of grain is one of the important tasks of the current rural work and an indispensable link in the socialist transformation of agriculture. Therefore, this work must be regarded as a basic construction in the countryside and done 100% well. If we only seek to save trouble and are simple and rough, and do not solve the serious problems that exist, it will destroy the achievements we have already made and make the "Three Fixes" work fall short. To this end, the Yuebei District Party Committee decided to concentrate its efforts and earnestly do a good job in the "Three Fixes" review work for a month, from mid-August to mid-September, while completing the summer requisition and purchase tasks.

    Based on existing experience, to do a good job in the "Three Fixes" review, we must grasp the following key links:

    1.  Rectify the thinking of staff members, correct their work style, so that they further clarify policies and practices, improve their work enthusiasm, and eliminate various ideological obstacles to the "Three Fixes" review. The counties in Yuebei District held expanded cadre meetings around August 15th to rectify the ideology and work style of 10,000 staff members (including the main staff members of the townships) participating in the "Three Fixes" work. From the situation reflected, the vast majority of staff members are active and enthusiastic, and they work tirelessly with an attitude of responsibility to the Party and the people. However, there are indeed some people who do not have an enthusiastic attitude towards this glorious task, but mistakenly believe that rural work is too hard, are nostalgic for urban life, and have great ideological resistance when they hear that a "Three Fixes" review is to be carried out. They created some absurd arguments, such as "review is asking for trouble," "it's about the same whether you check or not," "the higher-ups transferred me to do the 'Three Fixes,' not to do the review," etc., to cover up their wrong ideas. In particular, some office staff members who were transferred to the countryside to do the "Three Fixes" work were counting down the days to return, complaining that the organization was not ending the work quickly enough, and some even sneaked back to the city. These are all manifestations of despicable bourgeois individualism, which must be resolutely corrected. At the expanded cadre meetings in various counties, the above-mentioned ideas have been criticized, and many staff members have recognized the harm of these wrong ideas after examination and criticism. The main problem at present is to further improve the understanding of staff members in their work and consolidate the determination to thoroughly do a good job in the "Three Fixes" review. Secondly, some staff members are blindly complacent, overestimate the achievements of the "Three Fixes," and think that it is okay to not do a review; some staff members are afraid of difficulties and are unwilling to work in backward townships (the focus of the review), and dare not mobilize the masses to expose problems, attempting to go through the motions hastily, or blindly reduce the fixed purchase tasks. We must also give strict criticism to these wrong ideas, and constantly use practical materials to educate those with this blind complacency, to ensure the implementation of policies and thoroughly do a good job in the "Three Fixes" review.

    2.  The central requirement of the "Three Fixes" review work is to resolutely and 100% implement policies. We must unify policies and tasks and complete tasks in accordance with policies. Therefore, it is wrong to simply increase the per-mu yield of farmers' fields and lower the farmers' grain retention in order to complete the task. This not only does not count as truly completing the task, but also violates the policy. According to the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Rural Grain" promulgated by the State Council and the situation of the previous "Three Fixes" work in the entire region, the "Three Fixes" review should focus on checking and implementing the "only purchase surplus grain, not purchase ration grain," "eliminate waste, ensure reasonable supply," "disaster relief and reduction" policies, and determining the proportion of summer and autumn grain purchases. In order to ensure that policies are correctly implemented, it is necessary to conduct in-depth and meticulous adjustments to purchase and sales figures, and prevent crudeness and haste. In areas where the fixed output was very unreasonable and the unified purchase tasks were simply allocated based on output, the review should first correctly assess the output, and generally adjust the excessively high or low parts based on the output fixed before the summer harvest to verify the normal annual output of each household; care should be taken for households who are orphaned, widowed, elderly, weak, and lack labor. At the same time, we must also earnestly grasp the actual situation of the tightness and looseness of purchase and sales last year, grasp the changes in population, grain fields, etc., and make adjustments. In areas where tasks were mainly allocated based on last year's purchase and sales base with reference to the assessed production figures, we should concentrate our efforts on adjusting the households with excessively lenient and excessively harsh tasks; in areas where the normal annual output was not assessed at all or was assessed very unreasonably, it should also be correctly assessed as a basis for adjusting purchase and sales figures; where the task allocation was reasonable, no further changes should be made. To correctly implement policies, we must also fully promote democracy, conduct in-depth publicity and explanation of various policies to farmers, solicit more opinions from the masses when adjusting tasks, and the evaluation committee should propose an adjustment plan based on the opinions of the masses and the principles of distribution, which should then be discussed and approved by the masses and repeatedly checked.

    3.  Continue to oppose the mentality of emphasizing purchase over sales among staff members, and earnestly do a good job in fixed sales. This year's unified purchase tasks have been reduced a lot compared to the past two years. Since the grain purchase figures have been reduced, strictly controlling the amount of grain sales and implementing a reasonable supply has become an extremely important task, otherwise, it will affect the reasonable supply of urban and rural people and cause fluctuations in market prices. Therefore, any idea that once the unified purchase of grain is completed, one can breathe a sigh of relief and the unified sales can be sloppy is extremely wrong. In the current review work on the fixed sales aspect in rural areas, in addition to reasonably adjusting the tight and loose supply plans of certain households, the main task is to do a good job in monthly supply, mobilize farmers to eat their own retained grain first, and then eat the grain supplied by the state, and promote saving grain and opposing waste. In particular, farmers should be educated to be careful even during the harvest season and consume grain according to plan, so that the grain supply will be guaranteed when the supply is tight next year. The grain supply work in disaster-stricken areas should also be done conscientiously, and the supply quota should be increased if it should be increased to ensure the recovery of production in the disaster-stricken areas. In addition, special personnel must be assigned to lead the work of fixed grain supply in small towns and implement it; the supply of feed for pigs must be quickly improved to encourage farmers to develop pig production.

### 必须正确贯彻政策

专栏：把粮食“三定”政策贯彻到户

    必须正确贯彻政策
    中共广东省粤北区委员会书记　张根生
    粤北区的粮食定产、定购、定销工作，自六月中旬开始在全区范围内展开，到夏收前止，全区一千九百五十九个乡（少数民族乡在外）除三十个乡工作进度较慢外，都已将产、购、销任务评定到户，并在四百零五个乡进行了复查。在“三定”工作中，大多数地区基本上能执行政策，使粮食工作向着制度化前进了一大步。据九个县三百一十八个乡的统计，定购数比一九五四年减少了百分之二十多；定销数比一九五四年减少了百分之三十七点五。大部分地区平均每人一年留粮达四百五十斤至五百斤，曲江、仁化等县可达到五百五十斤。平均每个农民留粮都比去年增加了五、六十斤谷。“三定”又大大推动了当前生产，进一步提高了农民的生产积极性。阳山县第二区在“三定”中超额完成了抢种一万九千亩甘薯的任务，并开了荒地四千多亩；英德县在“三定”工作的同时，开展了积肥运动，全县共积肥四百万担；从今年夏种到八月十五日，粤北全区基本上完成了插秧。这些都为农业合作化的大发展创造了有利的条件。
    但是，由于“三定”是一项新的工作，工作人员和群众都还缺乏经验，开始时对方针、政策的领会不够深刻、明确，因而对“三定”工作的成绩还不能估计过高。根据检查各地执行政策情况结果及最近各县扩大干部会议所暴露的情况来看，“三定”工作中还存在着比较严重的问题。最主要的是购销数字的分配不尽合理，特别是户和户之间有偏轻偏重的现象。阳山是“三定”工作做得较好的县，但“三定”真正做得较好，百分之九十的群众满意的乡，不过占该县总乡数四分之一，仍有百分之二、三十的群众有意见的乡占该县总乡数二分之一，遗留问题很多的乡则占四分之一。从已经复查的乡来看，粮食购销数字须进行调整的户大体占总户数的百分之二十左右。如清远县三嘉乡共四百七十二户，经复查，调高定购任务的三十五户，调低定购任务的六十二户；调高定销任务的十二户，调低定销任务的八户：调整户数占该乡总户数的百分之二十四点七八。南雄县已经过了“三定”复查，但在夏征夏购中又查出还有百分之五的户购销数字不够合理，因此再次予以复查调整。其次，还有许多地区在定销时没有做好分月计划供应工作。
    为什么会产生这样的情况呢？这首先是因为某些工作人员对“三定”的重要意义认识不足，有片面任务观点和重购轻销思想。有的工作人员单纯以产量计购，而定产又很不合理（全乡以一、二个增产率推算）；也有的工作人员为了完成任务盲目提高产量；新丰县有个别工作人员还错误地提出“产量服从任务”的原则，没有注意参考去年购销的实际情况，或者只照去年购销数（去年有很多不合理的地方）平均分配今年的购销数字；有的工作人员在公布任务后没有发扬民主、走群众路线，以致有些生产条件较好的农户（主要是中农）应该出售的余粮没有售足，而生产条件较差的农户（贫农和孤寡老弱困难户）出售的粮食则超过了余粮的界限。由于“三定”工作中存在着不少缺点，生产和互助合作运动受到一定的影响。乐昌县沙州乡副乡长陈来娇领导的互助组十三户中曾有九户闹退组，就是因为购销数字分配得不合理所引起的。其次，由于有些地区的工作人员单纯从数字上进行调整分配任务，忽视了深入地广泛地进行宣传教育工作，以致在“三定”之后，有些农民服从国家计划的思想仍未很好确立，有些农民对“三定”政策的认识仍很不够，不知道自己所承担的任务是怎样计算出来的，有些农民甚至还抱着“少卖多留”的错误思想。
    上述情况在各地不同程度地存在着。这充分说明了“三定”到户工作的复杂性和艰巨性。必须认识，彻底做好“三定”工作，实现粮食统购统销的制度化，是当前农村工作的重要任务之一，是农业的社会主义改造不可缺少的一环；因此这一工作必须作为农村的一项基本建设来看待，百分之百地把它做好。如果只图省事，简单粗糙，对存在的严重问题不加解决，那就会破坏既得的成果，使“三定”工作功亏一篑。为此，粤北区党委决定在八月中旬到九月中旬，以一个月时间，集中力量，切实做好“三定”复查工作，同时完成夏征夏购任务。
    根据已有的经验，做好“三定”复查，必须抓住如下几个环节：
    一、整顿工作人员的思想，端正他们的作风，使他们进一步明确政策、作法，提高工作积极性，打消对“三定”复查的各种思想障碍。粤北区各县在八月十五日左右召开了扩大干部会议，对参加
  “三定”工作的一万个工作人员（包括乡的主要工作人员）进行了思想作风的整顿。从反映出的情况看来，绝大部分工作人员是积极热情的，他们以对党对人民负责的态度，毫不厌倦地努力工作。但也确有一些人对待这一光荣任务，不是抱着热情的态度，而是错误地认为农村工作太辛苦，留恋城市生活，听到要进行“三定”复查，思想抵触很大。他们制造一些荒谬的论调，如“复查是找麻烦”，
  “查不查都差不多了”，“上面调我来搞‘三定’的，不是来搞复查的”等，来替自己的错误思想作掩饰。特别是，有一些抽调下乡搞“三定”工作的机关工作人员，天天数着归期，埋怨组织为什么还不快些结束工作，甚至有的偷偷跑回城市。这些都是卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义的表现，必须切实纠正。各县在扩大干部会上，对于上述思想已进行批判，很多工作人员经过了检查批判，认识了这些错误思想的危害性。当前主要问题是在工作中进一步提高工作人员的认识，将彻底搞好“三定”复查的决心巩固下来。其次，有些工作人员盲目自满，对“三定”成绩估计过高，认为复查不复查都可以了；有些工作人员则害怕困难，不愿到后进乡（复查重点）工作，不敢发动群众暴露问题，企图草草走过场，或盲目减少定购任务。我们对这些错误的思想也都要给以严格批判，并不断用实际材料，来对有这种盲目自满情绪的人进行教育，以保证贯彻政策，彻底做好“三定”复查工作。
    二、“三定”复查工作的中心要求是坚决地、百分之百地贯彻政策。必须把政策和任务统一起来，按照政策完成任务。因此，那种单纯为了完成任务，因而盲目提高农民的田亩产量，压低农民的口粮留量等做法是错误的；这样不仅不能算是真正完成任务，而且是违反了政策。根据国务院公布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”的规定及全区前段“三定”工作情况，目前“三定”复查中应着重检查和贯彻“只购余粮，不购口粮”“杜绝浪费，保证合理供应”、“受灾减免”等政策贯彻的情况以及夏秋购粮比例的确定等情况。为使政策得到正确贯彻，必须深入细致地进行调整购销数字，防止粗糙草率。原来定产很不合理而又只是单纯按产量来简单分配统购任务的地区，复查时首先要正确评定产量，一般可在夏收前所定产量的基础上，调整偏高偏低部分，来核定各户常年产量；对孤、寡、老、弱等缺乏劳动力经营不好的农户要予以照顾。同时并要切实掌握去年购销宽紧的实际情况，掌握人口、粮田等变动情况，进行调整。原来主要是按去年的购销基础参照评产数字来分配任务的地区，应在集中力量着重调整任务偏轻的户和偏重的户；如原来完全没有评定常年产量或评得很不合理的地区，也应正确予以评定，以作为调整购销数字的依据；原来任务分配合理的，就不要再加变动。要正确贯彻政策，还必须充分发扬民主，将各项政策向农民深入宣传解释，调整任务时要多征求群众意见，由评议委员会根据群众意见和分配原则提出调整方案，再经群众讨论通过，并反复进行检查。
    三、继续反对工作人员中存在的重购轻销思想，切实做好定销工作。今年统购任务比过去两年都减少了很多。既然购粮数字减少了，严格控制粮食销售量，实行合理的供应，就成为极其重要的工作，否则，就会影响城乡人民的合理供应，并造成市场物价波动。因此，任何认为粮食统购完成，就可松一口气，统销马虎一点不要紧的思想，都是极其错误的。在目前农村的定销方面的复查工作中，除合理地调整某些户偏紧偏松的供应计划外，主要是做好分月供应工作，动员农民先吃自己留的粮，后吃国家供应的粮，提倡节约粮食，反对浪费。特别要教育农民即使是在收获季节，也要精打细算，按计划消费粮食，这样到明年青黄不接时，粮食供应才有保证。对受灾地区的粮食供应工作也要认真做好，应该增加供应指标的必须增加，以保证灾区生产的恢复。此外，对小城镇的粮食定量供应工作，必须抽出专人领导，贯彻施行；猪的饲料供应，必须迅速搞好，以鼓励农民发展生猪生产。
