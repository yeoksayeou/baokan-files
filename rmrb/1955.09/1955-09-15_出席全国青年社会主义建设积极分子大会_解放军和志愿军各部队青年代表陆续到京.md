Xinhua News Agency, 14th September. More than 150 youth representatives from various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, attending the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism, are arriving in Beijing one after another.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army youth attending this conference have played exemplary roles in safeguarding and supporting the socialist construction of the motherland and completing troop training tasks. Many of them come from the forefront of the motherland's coastal and border defenses. Among them is Yu Zhongcheng, a youth representative from a certain company that participated in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island. This company, with its swift and agile movements and high degree of flexibility, captured the enemy's stronghold "Victory Slope" on Yijiangshan Island in a very short time, eliminating 131 enemy soldiers. There is also Yu Huawu, a youth representative from a certain naval艇队 (艇队 tǐngduì : flotilla/boat squadron) that sank the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "Taiping" escort destroyer with resourceful, brave, and accurate actions, and Yuan Yingzhong, a young Lahu soldier from a certain unit of the Public Security Forces who modeled the national policies in the struggle to defend the motherland's borders and repeatedly annihilated U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek special agents who crossed the border illegally. In addition, there is Wang Wenjin, a youth representative from a certain anti-aircraft artillery company that shot down and damaged 12 enemy aircraft in ten days while defending the motherland's airspace on the Fujian front. Furthermore, there is Song Zhongwen, a young Communist Party member from a certain air force unit, who shot down two enemy aircraft and damaged one in the battle to defend the motherland's airspace.

Many of the young activists in the People's Liberation Army are outstanding soldiers who have studied diligently and worked hard in regular military training, overcome all difficulties, and quickly mastered modern military technology. Wang Kunzhang, a new soldier who joined the army in March this year, studied the essentials diligently with the help of officers and veteran soldiers. He participated in seven shooting exercises and achieved "excellent" results in all seven. Qin Wuxi and Ye Chunguang are both excellent shooters who have achieved excellent results in military training.

Many of the representatives are also young PLA activists who have made outstanding contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. Lou Hanting, a young Communist Party member in the caisson team of a certain railway engineering unit, diligently studied and learned the technology of caisson blasting. When building the Yujiang River Bridge on the Litang-Zhanjiang Railway, he led the entire team to successfully complete the underwater blasting of rocks. The team he was in was awarded a collective third-class merit. Young squad leader Yang Xiuyun created a "double bamboo pipe manual water pump" while performing the task of installing culverts on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway construction site, overcoming the difficulty of lacking water pumps at the time.

The young activists of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army attending this conference are mostly heroic and model figures who made military exploits before the Korean armistice in 1953. Wang Zhanshan, a platoon leader, recipient of the "Second-Class Hero" title and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's "First-Class National Flag Medal," was wounded four times but refused to leave the front line during the 1953 summer Kumsong counterattack, heroically commanding his entire platoon to hold the position for four days and nights, repelling more than 30 counterattacks by the enemy ranging from a squad to two battalions, and eliminating more than 400 enemy soldiers. Li Xuefu, a Communist Party member and squad leader, heroically destroyed 14 enemy bunkers and firepower points during the summer counterattack in 1953, leading his entire squad, and repelled 11 counterattacks by the enemy ranging from a squad to a company. He also used enemy ammunition to eliminate more than 100 enemy soldiers, achieving a victory of eliminating the enemy at a ratio of one to ten. After the war, Li Xuefu was awarded the title of "Second-Class Hero" and the "First-Class National Flag Medal" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Among the youth activist representatives of the Volunteer Army, there are also many who have made contributions to helping the Korean people rebuild their homes after the Korean armistice. Li Zongshi, a young engineer squad leader, continuously improved work methods when helping the Korean people repair the Datong River Railway Bridge, making the riveting efficiency more than eight times higher than the local standard. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the "Second-Class Warrior Honor Medal" for this.

    出席这次大会的中国人民解放军青年在保卫和支援祖国社会主义建设、完成部队训练等任务中都曾起了模范作用。他们当中许多人都来自祖国的海防和边防前哨。其中有参加解放一江山岛战斗的某连的青年代表喻仲成。这个连队曾以勇猛迅速的动作和高度的灵活性，在很短的时间内攻占了一江山岛上敌人的支撑点“胜利坡”，并歼敌一百三十一名；有曾以机智、勇敢、准确的动作击沉蒋贼“太平号”护航驱逐舰的海军某艇队的青年代表于化武，和在守卫祖国边防的斗争中模范地执行民族政策，多次歼灭偷越国境的美蒋特务的公安军某部青年代表、拉祜族青年战士袁应忠；也有在福建前线保卫祖国领空中，十天内击落击伤敌机十二架的高射炮兵某连的青年代表王文进。此外，还有空军某部青年共产党员宋中文，他在保卫祖国领空的战斗中，先后击落敌机两架，击伤一架。

    中国人民志愿军出席这次大会的青年积极分子，绝大部分都是在一九五三年朝鲜停战前建立了战功的英雄模范人物。“二级英雄”、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“一级国旗勋章”的获得者、排长王占山，在一九五三年夏季金城反击战中，四次负伤不下火线，英勇指挥全排坚守阵地四昼夜，打退敌人一个班至两个营的三十多次反扑，歼敌四百多名。共产党员、班长栗学福，在一九五三年夏季反击战中，率领全班英勇炸毁敌人地堡及火力点十四个，打退敌人一个班到一个连的十一次反扑；并利用敌人弹药消灭敌人一百余名，取得了歼敌一比十的胜利。战后栗学福被授予“二级英雄”称号，荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“一级国旗勋章”。志愿军的青年积极分子代表中还有许多在朝鲜停战后，在帮助朝鲜人民重建家园中建立功绩的人物。青年工兵班长李宗诗，在帮助朝鲜人民修复大同江铁桥时，不断改进作业方法，使铆钉工效超过当地标准工八倍以上。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为此授予他“二级战士荣誉勋章”。
