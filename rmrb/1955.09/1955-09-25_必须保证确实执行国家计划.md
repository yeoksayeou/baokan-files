    Strive to Fulfill and Overfulfill the 1955 Plan
    It Is Necessary to Ensure the Faithful Implementation of State Plans
    Liu Zhan, Deputy Director of the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau

    Based on the guidelines and tasks for the textile industry in 1955 proposed by the Ministry of Textile Industry, and combined with the specific conditions in the Southwest, the factories under the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau have universally launched a mass campaign of "Strictly Practicing Comprehensive Economy and Overcoming All Waste." The concept of economy has been initially established among the employees, and the cost and capital construction plans have been re-compiled and reviewed. The cost plan is 7.86 percent lower than in 1954, and the investment in capital construction has been reduced by 1.98 million yuan. The factories have strengthened financial cost management and technical leadership to varying degrees, so the state plan was comprehensively completed in the first half of the year. Among them, a total of 75,678 kilograms of cotton and 13,434 kilograms of cotton yarn were saved; the cost of commodity products (excluding the value of industrial operations) was 2.43 percent lower than planned, and the profit completion rate was 107.10 percent. Except for the silk reeling index, which did not meet the plan, the silk factories overfulfilled the state plan. In order to further implement the spirit of strict economy, the cotton textile factories have further formulated economy targets on the basis of re-compiling the annual plan. Preliminary statistics show that costs are expected to be reduced by another 310,000 yuan in the second half of the year, working capital will be reduced by 600,000 yuan, and cotton consumption is expected to be 20,689 kilograms less than the actual consumption in the first half of the year. This not only puts forward specific goals for all employees but also helps to further organize and mobilize the masses to practice economy in all aspects and links, and ensure the comprehensive completion of the 1955 production plan.

    However, there are still many mistakes and shortcomings in our work. From the preliminary inspection of factories such as 611, Yuhua, Yuxin, and Silk No. 3, the prominent issue is that there are false and chaotic phenomena in the implementation of state plans in various factories, especially in Yuhua and Silk No. 3 factories. Specifically, it is manifested in: 1. Adopting methods such as increasing inventory differences, revising plans, and adjusting the unit prices of major repairs and technical measures projects to complete the total output value plan. From January to May, the Yuhua Factory failed to complete the planned value of major repairs and industrial operations each month, which affected the completion of commodity output value to only 99.12 percent. However, they used increased inventory differences to make up for it, thus "completing" 100.13 percent. In April, the 611 Factory did not complete the planned total output value because some of the major repairs and technical measures projects had been completed ahead of schedule in the first quarter. After three revisions, most of the project unit prices were increased, and the projects that were not reported in the first quarter were included, resulting in the "completion" of 100.03 percent of the output value in April. 2. Falsely reporting the number of production workers to complete the labor productivity plan. From January to May, the Yuhua Factory did not complete the planned labor productivity in any month, but in the statistics, the number of production workers was arbitrarily adjusted. When the plan could not be completed, a group of workers were removed and included in short-term study, resulting in a large difference between the reported number of production workers and the actual number. The repair section of the 611 Factory has long employed temporary workers since 1952, averaging about 30 people per day, but has never included them in the labor plan as required. 3. Inaccurate cotton consumption. Due to the non-compliance of cotton yarn finished product weight with national standards and the adjustment of semi-finished product inventory figures, cotton consumption was falsely increased or decreased. A spot check of nine batches of cotton yarn finished products produced by the Yuhua Factory from May to July showed that they were all lighter than the standard weight, so the unit cotton consumption was falsely reduced. 4. False reporting of finished product warehousing. For a long time, Silk No. 3 Factory often had problems with the color matching of raw silk finished products, and the finished products could not be warehoused in time, which affected the completion of the plan. This factory adopted the method of focusing on consistent color matching and not seriously packing according to the inspected silk grade to complete the warehousing and sales tasks, thus causing arbitrary upgrading and downgrading of raw silk, which seriously affected the correctness of the raw silk grade. Cotton textile factories often have excessive packaging of cotton yarn without warehousing, or use the inventory of semi-finished products from the previous period to pack and warehouse when the plan cannot be completed. 5. Falsely reporting the completion of the financial plan: The 611 Factory did not complete the profit target in the first quarter, falling short by more than 7,500 yuan, but the accounting department used an unreasonable price adjustment method to turn the original unfulfilled plan into an overfulfillment of more than 7,100 yuan, thus being able to withdraw more than 5,900 yuan in enterprise reward funds.

    Why do the above-mentioned false and chaotic errors occur in completing the various indicators of the state plan?

    The primary reason is that the leaders of these factories are not working diligently and conscientiously in completing the state plan, but only considering personal gains and losses, wanting to complete the state plan without much effort or with less effort, and thus do not hesitate to adopt methods such as falsification and speculation to shamefully deceive the state in order to obtain personal or unit honors. For example, the person in charge of the labor and wage department of the Yuhua Factory, in order to show off himself and deceive the leadership, did not actively report to the leadership and take effective measures to solve the problem when labor productivity could not be completed. When the factory leaders asked him about the situation, he said, "Guarantee 100 percent completion of the plan is no problem," but in fact, he illegally adjusted the number of production workers and falsely reported the completion of the plan. Some leaders of the Silk No. 3 Factory did not pack and warehouse according to the inspected silk grade, passing off inferior goods as good goods, which affected the correctness of the raw silk grade. Although criticism was made and strictly prohibited in 1954, these staff members not only did not seriously check this illegal behavior and thoroughly correct it, but instead believed that "the Commodity Inspection Bureau's spot check may not be able to detect it." For example, the Yuhua Factory has carried out a series of work on saving cotton consumption and achieved certain results, but individual staff members have the idea of "rather light than heavy" when mastering the yarn gram weight, and do not strictly follow the national standards, but take the principle of not exceeding the prescribed light range. Some technicians even do not follow national regulations, and the cotton yarn does not reach a constant weight when drying, which directly affects the insufficient weight of the cotton yarn and the false reduction of cotton consumption.

    Secondly, there are still chaotic phenomena in enterprise management and the system is not sound. Due to the chaos in management and the lack of sound systems in various factories, violations such as "drawing from here and there" and "reluctantly piecing together" occur when completing the state plan. First of all, there is a lack of perfect systems in the planning, balancing, review, implementation, and inspection of plans. Among them, the major repair and technical measures plans are the most prominent. The plans are not carefully considered during compilation, they are carelessly pieced together, the implementation of the plans cannot be guaranteed, and they are revised at any time. Some factories even include the projects completed in the first quarter into the plan for the second quarter. There is a lack of normal data during inspection and statistics. Some factories have no original records at all, relying only on the memory and oral statements of the planning staff. Therefore, the reports and the actual situation differ greatly, causing chaos in the entire planning work. Secondly, the original records are incorrect and there are errors in calculations. For example, water surplus often occurs in the calculation of cotton consumption in various factories. The weight of cotton yarn plus waste recycled cotton often exceeds the total cotton consumption, and some factories even exceed 2.9 percent. Thirdly, the work of the departments is weak, especially the work of the main departments related to the completion of the plan, such as planning, accounting, maintenance, and supply, cannot meet the needs of work development, and the work is busy and passive. The political atmosphere in the departments is weak, some staff members are irresponsible, and the coordination and cooperation between departments are also very poor. Errors and omissions often occur in the report figures, and the work is delayed and backloged.

    Another point is that there is a relatively common sense of pride and complacency and bureaucratic work style among enterprise leaders. In the past few years, various factories have made progress in completing the state plan, and enterprise management has also improved. However, some factory leaders have gradually developed a sense of pride and complacency, are satisfied with the existing achievements, no longer strictly check the shortcomings in their work, and do not humbly listen to the opinions of others, which leads to the long-term failure to overcome errors and shortcomings. For example, after a series of efforts to reduce cotton consumption in some factories, there has been a significant decrease, but compared with some factories, although cotton consumption is low, waste cotton is high. This unreasonable phenomenon has not aroused the vigilance of various factories. Since the beginning of this year, users have also frequently reported short lengths, but they have not seriously and seriously researched and checked. Some factory leaders have a serious bureaucratic work style, do not delve into the production process to study business, do not carefully analyze and study the specific situation of plan completion, lightly believe the reports from below, and do not go down to check their work. Some factory leaders are completely unaware of the falsehood and chaos existing in their enterprises until the inspection team reports the seriousness of the problem.

    These facts show that the staff at all levels in our enterprises have not firmly established the idea of comprehensively completing the state plan, but instead adopt improper methods to "complete" the plan. In essence, this practice is a reflection of capitalist business thinking and style in our enterprises, which is a violation of policies and systems. These erroneous practices not only conceal the true situation in the enterprise, making it impossible to correct the shortcomings and errors in the work in a timely manner, but also hinder the implementation of the comprehensive economy policy and affect the comprehensive completion of the state plan, which is incompatible with the nature of socialist enterprises.

    In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's production increase and economy and production plan, the production enterprises under the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau should pay special attention to and do the following work: 1. Seriously treat the state plan and firmly establish the idea of comprehensively completing the state plan. Various factories should combine with further in-depth development of the "strictly implement comprehensive economy, overcome all waste" work, and seriously expose and expose the false and chaotic phenomena in the completion of the state plan. Through inspection, use examples to educate employees, criticize and overcome pride and complacency and capitalist business thinking style, and resolutely oppose the ideas and behaviors of falsification. 2. Strengthen management work and improve the level of enterprise management. Various factories should further strengthen management work, clarify responsibilities, and establish and improve various systems to overcome and prevent the occurrence of false errors. First of all, special attention should be paid to strengthening the production, technology, and financial plan preparation, balancing, implementation, inspection, and other systems. Secondly, improve the original records and effectively correct and overcome the errors and omissions in the original records and statistical reports. Thirdly, strengthen the work of the departments, and pay special attention to strengthening the political and ideological leadership of the work of the departments, and ensure the completion of business work through political work. Leading staff must go deep into the production process, study business, and do all aspects of the enterprise work seriously and conscientiously. 3. In anti-falsification, we must pay close attention to exposing bad people and bad things, and be alert to the conspiracy of bad elements to use our lack of business skills to carry out sabotage; serious falsification behaviors should be thoroughly investigated and studied, distinguishing responsibilities and nature, making correct conclusions, and conducting serious handling.

    努力完成和超额完成一九五五年计划
    必须保证确实执行国家计划
    西南纺织管理局副局长　刘瞻
    根据纺织工业部提出的一九五五年纺织工业的方针和任务，结合西南具体情况，西南纺织管理局所属各厂普遍开展了群众性的“厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费”的工作，在职工中初步树立了节约观念；重新编制和审查了成本、基本建设计划。成本计划比一九五四年降低百分之七点八六，基本建设削减投资一百九十八万元。各厂在不同程度上加强了财务成本管理及技术领导工作，因此上半年比较全面地完成了国家计划。其中共节约棉花七万五千六百七十八公斤、棉纱一万三千四百三十四公斤；商品产品成本（扣除工业性作业价值）比计划降低百分之二点四三，利润完成百分之一百零七点一零。丝纺各厂除缫折指标未完成计划外，其余都超额完成国家计划。为了进一步贯彻厉行节约的精神，棉纺各厂在重编年计划的基础上又进一步制定了节约指标，初步统计下半年成本预计可再降低三十一万元，流动资金减少六十万元，用棉量预计比上半年实际再节约二万零六百八十九公斤。这样不但为全体职工提出了具体的奋斗目标，也更有利于进一步组织和动员群众从各个方面各个环节来厉行节约，保证全面完成一九五五年的生产计划。
    但是，在我们的工作中还有不少的错误和缺点。从初步检查六一一、裕华、渝新、丝三厂等厂的情况来看，突出的是各厂在执行国家计划中有虚假和混乱现象，其中以裕华、丝三厂尤为严重。具体表现在：一、采用加大盘存差额，修改计划，调整大修理、技术措施工程单价的办法来完成总产值计划。裕华厂一月到五月大修理和工业性作业价值每月都未完成计划，影响到商品产值只能完成百分之九十九点一二。但他们用加大盘存差额来弥补，因而“完成”了百分之一百点一三。六一一厂四月份因大修理技术措施工程已提前一部分于第一季度完工，总产值未完成计划，经三次修改，将大部分工程单价提高，再将第一季度漏报的项目列入，结果使四月份产值“完成”百分之一百点零三。二、假报生产工人人数来完成劳动生产率计划。裕华厂一月到五月劳动生产率没有一个月完成计划，但在统计时，却随意调整生产工人人数，完不成计划时即剔出一部分工人列入短期学习，造成上报生产工人人数和实际数目相差很大。六一一厂修缮科从一九五二年到现在长期雇用临时工，平均每天约三十人，却从未按规定编入劳动计划。三、用棉量不真实。由于棉纱成品重量不合国家规定标准以及调整半制品盘存数字，造成用棉量虚增虚降。裕华厂抽查了五月到七月生产的九批棉纱成品，都比标准重量偏轻，因此单位用棉量虚降。四、成品入库的虚假。丝三厂较长时期以来常因生丝配色成件有问题，成品不能及时入库，影响计划的完成。这个厂便采取了以配色一致为准，不认真按检验丝级装箱的办法来完成入库和销售任务，因此造成生丝随意升降级，严重影响了生丝品级的正确。棉纺各厂则常常发生棉纱成包过多而不入库，或完不成计划时利用上期的半成品盘存数来打包入库等。五、虚报完成财务计划：六一一厂第一季度利润指标未完成，差七千五百多元，但会计科用了不合理调整价格的办法，使原来未完成的计划变为超额七千一百多元完成了，因此得以提存企业奖励基金五千九百多元。
    为什么在完成国家计划的各项指标上会产生以上各种虚假混乱的错误呢？
    首要的一个原因是这些厂的领导人员在完成国家计划上不是兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳地进行艰苦实际的工作，只考虑个人得失，想不费力气或少费力气完成国家计划，因而不惜采取弄虚作假、投机取巧等方法对国家进行可耻的欺骗以获得个人或本单位的荣誉。如裕华厂劳动工资部门负责人员为了表现自己和骗取领导的信任，在劳动生产率完不成计划时，不是积极地向领导反映，采取有效措施加以解决，当厂领导人员向他了解情况时，他反说：“保证百分之百完成计划没问题”，而实际上却非法调整生产工人人数，虚报完成计划。丝三厂有些领导人员不按检验丝级装箱入库，以劣货充好货，影响生丝品级的正确。虽然在一九五四年已对此提出批评并严加禁止，但是这些工作人员不但未认真检查这种违法行为，彻底改正，反而认为“商品检验局抽查，不一定检验得出”。又如裕华厂在节约用棉上进行了一系列工作取得一定成绩，但是个别工作人员在掌握成纱格林重量时却有“宁轻勿重”的思想，不切实按照国家规定标准，而以不超出规定的偏轻范围为原则。甚至有的技术人员不按国家规定，棉纱干燥时没有达到不变重量，直接影响棉纱重量不足和用棉量虚降。
    其次是企业管理工作还有混乱现象，制度不健全。各厂由于管理工作混乱，制度不健全，在完成国家计划时产生“东拉西扯”、“勉强凑数”等违反规定的行为。首先表现在计划的编制、平衡审查、执行、检查等方面缺乏完善的制度。其中尤以大修理、技术措施计划最为突出，编制时考虑不周，马虎凑数，计划执行得不到保证，随时修改，甚至有些厂竟把第一季度已完工程又编入第二季度计划。在检查、统计时缺乏正常的资料，有的厂根本没有原始记录，只凭计划人员的记忆和口述。因此，表报同实际情况出入很大，造成整个计划工作的混乱。其次是原始记录不正确以及计算上的错误。如各厂在计算用棉量中经常发生水余现象，往往棉纱重量加上下脚回花而超出了总用棉量，有的厂竟超出百分之二点九。再次是科室工作薄弱，特别是计划、会计、保全、供应等关系完成计划的主要科室的工作，不能适应工作发展的需要，工作忙乱被动。科室政治空气稀薄，有些工作人员不负责任，同时各个部门配合协作也很差，表报数字经常发生错漏，工作拖拉积压。
    再一个是在企业领导人员中较普遍有骄傲自满情绪和官僚主义作风。几年来各厂在完成国家计划上有进步，企业管理工作也有改进。但是有些厂的领导人员却因此逐渐滋长了骄傲自满情绪，满足于已有的成绩，不再严格检查自己工作中的缺点，也不虚心听取别人的意见，致使错误和缺点长期得不到克服。如有些厂的用棉量，在进行了一系列工作后有了显著的下降，但同有些厂比较，用棉量虽低，下脚棉却高。这一不合理的现象，未引起各厂的警惕。今年以来，用户又纷纷反映短码，也未认真严肃地研究检查。有些厂的领导人员官僚主义作风严重，不深入生产过程钻研业务，不认真分析研究计划完成的具体情况，轻信下面的报告，不深入下去检查他们的工作。有的厂领导人员对自己企业中存在的虚假和混乱竟毫无所闻，直至检查组汇报后才知道问题的严重。
    这些事实说明了我们企业中各级工作人员尚未牢固地树立全面完成国家计划的思想，而是采用不正当作法来“完成”计划。就实质上讲，这种做法是资本主义经营思想和作风在我们企业中的反映，这是违反政策、违反制度的行为。这些错误的作法不仅掩盖了企业中的真实情况，使工作上的缺点和错误不能及时纠正，而且阻碍了全面厉行节约方针的贯彻，影响国家计划的全面完成，这是同社会主义企业性质不相容的。
    为保证全面完成今年增产节约和生产计划，西南纺织管理局所属的各生产企业单位要特别注意和做好以下工作：一、严肃对待国家计划，牢固树立全面完成国家计划的思想。各厂应结合进一步深入开展“厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费”的工作，认真揭发和暴露完成国家计划中的虚假和混乱现象。通过检查以实例教育职工，批判并克服骄傲自满情绪和资本主义经营思想作风，坚决反对弄虚作假的思想和行为。二、加强管理工作，提高企业管理水平。各厂应进一步认真加强管理工作，明确职责，建立和健全各种制度，以克服和防止虚假错误的产生。首先应特别注意加强生产、技术、财务计划编制、平衡、执行、检查等制度。其次，健全原始记录，切实纠正和克服原始记录、统计报表中的错漏。再次，加强科室工作，特别要注意加强对科室工作的政治思想领导，通过政治工作来保证业务工作的完成。领导工作人员必须深入生产过程，钻研业务，认真踏实地做好企业各项工作。三、在反虚假中必须密切注意揭发坏人坏事，警惕坏分子利用我们业务不熟进行破坏的阴谋；对严重的弄虚作假的行为应深入调查研究，分清责任和性质，作出正确的结论，进行严肃的处理。（转载四川日报）
