Li Peiming and Bi Xinglan, engraving workers at the repair shop of Qingdao State-Owned Second Rubber General Factory, with the strong support of factory leaders and the help of technical personnel, have successfully created a "universal engraving machine" after several years of hard work, making the process of engraving tire mold patterns for automobile tires mechanized and automated.

This "universal engraving machine" is equipped with a forward-reverse switch reducer and an electrical automatic device with more than one hundred cutting speeds, and has automatic flat turning and vertical turning tool rests. One person operating this machine can flexibly and accurately engrave tire mold patterns of different arcs, different angles, and different depths. In the past, this factory used old-fashioned engraving machines. Engraving a set of tire molds required vertical and horizontal engraving machines, as well as drilling, scraping, and other processes using other tools, taking more than forty days, and the products were often not up to standard. Because the old-fashioned engraving machines were bulky, even two people operating the machine were very tired. Using the "universal engraving machine," according to preliminary estimates, work efficiency can be improved four to five times even in the case of unskilled operation. The physical labor of workers is greatly reduced, and the quality of products can be guaranteed to be consistently qualified.

Before researching and creating the "universal engraving machine," Li Peiming had researched and improved the vertical engraving machine, and together with Bi Xinglan, researched and improved the horizontal engraving machine. (Shi Wensheng, et al.)

    李培明等创造“万能雕刻机”
    青岛市国营第二橡胶总厂修配车间雕刻工人李培明和毕星澜，在工厂领导人员大力支持和技术人员帮助下，经过几年的刻苦研究，创造“万能雕刻机”成功，使雕刻汽车轮胎胎模花纹的工序机械化和自动化。
    这种“万能雕刻机”带有倒正开关减速机和一百多种吃刀速度的电气自动装置，有自动平镟、立镟刀架。一个人操纵这部机器，可以灵活而准确地雕刻出不同圆弧、不同角度和不同深度的胎模花纹。过去这个厂使用旧式雕刻机，雕刻一付胎模需要经过立式、卧式雕刻机雕刻，以及用其他工具钻眼、刮花加工等工序，要用四十多天时间，产品还常不合规格。由于旧式雕刻机笨重，两个人掌握机器还非常劳累。使用“万能雕刻机”，据初步估计，在操作技术不熟练的情况下也能提高工作效率四五倍。工人的体力劳动大为减轻，产品质量也能保证经常合格。
    在研究创造“万能调刻机”以前，李培明曾经研究改进了立式雕刻机，并同毕星澜一起研究改进了卧式雕刻机。（石文声等）
