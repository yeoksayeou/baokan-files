    A State-Owned Ginseng Farm
    Wang Lingyun
    Ninety *li* southeast of Fushong County town in Jilin Province, there is a flat area in a lush forest with rows of neat, rectangular pools. This is the Fushong State-Owned Ginseng Farm in Jilin Province.

    The Fushong State-Owned Ginseng Farm is a specialized cultivated ginseng plantation. More than 300 years ago, people collected wild ginseng seeds from the mountains here for artificial cultivation. In 1946, the state established the first state-owned Fushong Ginseng Farm here. Now, the total planting area of the farm has reached 5,444 *zhang* (each *zhang* is one *zhang* long and one *zhang* and four *chi* wide). In the ten years since its establishment, the farm has provided the state with 25,600 *jin* of finished cultivated ginseng and turned over a net profit of more than 600,000 yuan. At the same time, the ginseng farm has also begun to improve cultivated ginseng cultivation techniques and has achieved initial success. In 1954, the ginseng farm achieved a high yield of three *jin* of finished cultivated ginseng per *zhang* of area. It summarized the advanced experience of wide pool spreading, reasonable deep planting, appropriate shallow covering, and early spring soil application in the second year. It also created a small artificial seeder, which reduced the amount of seeds sown per *zhang* from the past three *liang* to 1.5 *liang*, overcoming the shortcomings of uneven density and uneven planting in the past, while also greatly reducing the consumption of seeds. This series of improved technical measures is unprecedented since the beginning of Chinese cultivated ginseng cultivation.

    With the state's requirements for developing cultivated ginseng, the Fushong Ginseng Farm has initially planned to reach a planting area of 100,000 *zhang* by 1962. It can produce 37,000 *jin* of finished cultivated ginseng annually, with a value of more than one million yuan. The farm is currently preparing for land surveying and planning. With the development of the Fushong Ginseng Farm, more new ginseng farms will soon appear in the Changbai Mountain area of Jilin Province.

    一个国营人参场
    王凌云
    距吉林省抚松县城东南九十里处，繁茂的森林中有一片平坦地带，排列一行行整齐的长方形的池子，这就是吉林省抚松国营参场。
    抚松国营参场是一个专业的园参种植栽培场。早在三百多年前，人们就在这里采集山中野参种籽进行了人工栽培。一九四六年国家在这里建立了第一个国营抚松参场，现在，全场种植面积已达五千四百四十四丈（每丈长为一丈，宽为一丈四尺）。在这建场十年中共交给国家成品园参达二万五千六百市斤、上缴纯利润共达六十多万元。同时参场还开始改进了园参的栽培技术，并已取得了初步成就。一九五四年参场每丈面积就获得了成品园参三市斤的高额丰产。总结出了池子宽摊，合理深栽，适当浅盖，第二年早春上土的先进经验。并创造了小型人工播种器、使每丈的播种量由过去的三两降为一·五两，克服了过去稀厚不均、倒栽不齐的缺点，同时也大大减少了种籽的消耗量。这一系列的改进技术措施，是自从中国园参栽培开始以来未曾做过的事情。
    随着国家发展园参的要求，抚松参场已经初步计划到一九六二年种植面积达十万丈。每年可产成品园参三万七千斤，价值达百多万元。这个场目前正准备进行土地勘测规划，随着抚松参场的发展，在吉林省的长白山一带，不久就会出现更多新的参场。
