    I Found a Way Out
    Qiubei
    Because I was greedy for money and blinded by it, I was dragged into the pit of fire by special agents of Chiang Kai-shek's "Mainland Work Department" and joined a secret agent organization. Now I have surrendered to the government and explained the matter clearly. The government not only did not punish me but also educated me and told me to concentrate on production. I shed tears several times for this matter out of gratitude. On the other hand, I wish I could skin those Chiang Kai-shek bandits who harm people everywhere.
    I am twenty-five years old this year and a native of Zhuhu Township, Andun, Huiyang County, Guangdong Province. My family is a poor peasant family. I went out to work for the landlords as a long-term laborer at the age of fourteen. After four years of work, I only earned enough to avoid starvation. Later, I heard that working in Hong Kong earned more money, so in 1949 I went to Hong Kong's Ma On Shan Dagong Kiln Factory No. 6 as a miner. Apart from clothing and food, there were still no savings from my wages. In 1953, my younger brother Qiu Guanlin wrote to me, repeatedly urging me to go home for production, saying that after the land reform, our family had been allocated houses and land, and our life had improved. He also sent the travel permit in the letter. However, I lacked travel expenses and had to watch the travel permit expire and become invalid. In July 1953, my younger brother sent another travel permit, saying in the letter: "If you don't go back this time, it will be difficult to apply for a travel permit in the future." I was so anxious that I ran around everywhere. How could poor workers lend me money? I could only stare blankly.
    At this time, my fellow villagers Qiu Qian and Cao Shilian pulled me to drink tea and quietly asked me: "Would you like to do a good job? You can get three thousand Hong Kong dollars, and if you do well, you will get two hundred dollars a month." They had invited me to Taiwan to be a soldier a couple of months ago, so I knew this must not be a good thing. But I was in urgent need of money and there was nothing I could do, so I agreed. They grabbed me very tightly and immediately asked me to talk to Li Siyong, the "shopkeeper" who opened a shop at the factory gate. Li Siyong first took my travel permit, then filled out a form for me, asked for three photos, and asked me to meet with two northerners to give me "armed ideology," explain the task, and state that this was "to be loyal to the Kuomintang," to "work underground" after returning home, to collect intelligence, burn bridges and granaries, and develop organizations; and finally, to swear an oath. I was tossed around by them for a few days in a daze. My travel permit was about to expire, so I asked about the money. Qiu Qian and Cao Shilian told me: "The superiors have issued two hundred yuan, and we'll see how you do later." The three thousand yuan became two hundred yuan, not to mention that; they also deducted "commissions" through various means. When I left, I didn't see any money at all. Li Siyong only took out a gold ring, and Qiu Qian took out a watch, which was worth about fifty Hong Kong dollars in total. Before I set off, the "northerners" came to the station to give me a series of tasks.
    On August 11, 1953, I returned to my home in Zhuhu Township, Andun, Huiyang County. The whole family was overjoyed, and the villagers came to see me too. I saw that everything in the township had undergone a complete change: the power of the landlords was gone, and some of the poor guys from the past had become representatives and some had become team leaders. My younger brother, Qiu Guanlin, who used to run around with a runny nose all day long, is now a militiaman and has joined the Youth League, and he has a say in the major affairs of the village and township. I was so happy, this is our government! But when I thought about it, what kind of person am I? I am a special agent, an enemy of the people. Thinking of this, I wished I could die.
  My brother and mother took me to see the water buffalo in the cowshed and to the back of the village to see
  a large piece of paddy field, saying that this was all allocated to our family after the land reform. They also said that the house we live in is also our own. My brother wanted me to come home and lead the production. I thought, in the past, we had no houses or land, but today we have houses, land, and耕牛, so who gave us this benefit? It is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. But, what kind of person am I? I am an enemy of the Communist Party and the people! I was so ashamed that I wanted to die.
    Several times, I wanted to talk to my brother about being tricked into joining the secret agent organization, but I always found it difficult to say. Later, I thought about talking to the township cadres directly, but I was afraid of being dealt with by the People's Government. After that, I comforted myself: "As long as I don't do the work of a special agent and produce well, I can let the matter pass quietly." In this way, I carried a heavy burden on my back and participated in the production of the township.
    In the township, I didn't dare to speak at large or small meetings. When others spoke, it seemed like they were talking to me, and I was often frightened; fearing that others would see that I had a problem, I pretended to be calm. This life was too bitter, it was really not human life.
    I often considered my own problems with extreme pain: What will the end be? Should I just hide it to the end? What if I am discovered? There is more than one person who joined the secret agent organization, what if I don't say it and others say it? Even if I am not discovered now, what if I am discovered in the future? Even if there is a great fluke and I am never discovered in my life, but my name is still on the list of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent organization, am I a member of the Communist Party? Or a member of the Chiang Kai-shek gang? Am I going to go to the coffin with a heinous secret agent crime? The questions I often asked myself made me restless. At this time, a major event that shook the world suddenly happened: Chen Folin was dealt with by the People's Government of Zijin County! The notice was posted in Huiyang County. Chen Folin was a worker in the same factory as me, and we returned from Hong Kong at the same time. We received the final tasks assigned by the secret agent organization at the railway station at the same time. My God! Will I only have such an ending?
      At the end of November 1954, Comrade Wu of the County Public Security Bureau came to my township to attend a meeting. At the meeting, he talked about the policy of the People's Government towards counter-revolutionaries, saying that resistance would be severely punished, while confession would be leniently treated, and that all counter-revolutionaries could only find a way out by confessing and surrendering. After listening to this report, I couldn't sleep for several nights. On November 23, as soon as it was dawn, I really couldn't hold it back anymore, so I made up my mind: "I don't care if I die if I confess." I went to the Township People's Committee and found Comrade Wu, and hesitantly told him about my experience in joining the secret agent organization. Comrade Wu saw that I was too nervous and had too many concerns, and I didn't confess everything, so he explained the policy to me in detail and asked me to thoroughly confess. After many ideological struggles, I confessed all the details of my participation in the secret agent organization.
    After confessing clearly, I felt a lot more relaxed. I was ready to accept any punishment from the People's Government. Later, the People's Government not only did not punish me but also encouraged me to produce well and asked me to atone for my sins.
    In the past six months, our production has been good and we have achieved a bumper harvest. Our family harvested 1,500 kilograms of grain after deducting all expenses, which has never happened before. But this is not enough, I must work harder to improve production. (Wu Yuji)

    我找到生路了
    丘北
    我因为贪图钱财，瞎了眼睛，被蒋匪“大陆工作处”的特务拉进了火坑，参加了特务组织。现在我已经向政府自首，把问题交代清楚了。政府不但没有惩办我，还教育我，要我安心生产。为这件事，我感激得掉了几次眼泪。另方面，对于那些到处坑害人的蒋贼特务，我恨不得剥他们的皮。
    我今年二十五岁，广东省惠阳县安墩珠湖乡人，家庭是贫农。十四岁我就出门给地主扛长活。干了四年，只挣个吃不饱饿不死。后来听说香港作工挣钱多，一九四九年我就到香港马鞍山大公窑行第六号厂当了一名矿工。所得工资除了穿衣吃饭，仍然没有节余。一九五三年我的弟弟丘关邻写信给我，一再劝我回家生产，说土地改革后我家分到房分到地，生活好转。他信里把通行证也寄来了。但是我欠缺路费，只好眼睁睁看着通行证过期作废。一九五三年七月，弟弟又寄来一张通行证，信上说：“这次再不回去，以后申请通行证就困难了。”我急得四处乱转，穷工人哪有钱借给我呢，只有干瞪眼。
    这时，同乡丘谦、曹石连拉我饮茶，悄悄问我：“有一桩好差事你干不干？可以拿三千元港币，干好了每月还有两百元薪水。”他们上两月曾经邀我去台湾当兵，所以我知道这一定不是好事。只是我急等钱用，一点办法没有，便答应了。他们抓得真紧，立刻要我找厂门口开铺子的“掌柜”李思咏谈话。李思咏首先要去了我的通行证，随着给我填表，又要去照片三张，又要我同两个北方人会面，给我“武装思想”，交代任务，说明这是“为国民党效忠”，回家以后是“作地下工作”，搜集情报，烧毁桥梁、粮仓，发展组织；末了还要宣誓。我腾云驾雾地给他们折腾了几天，通行证又快到期了，我打听钱的事情，丘谦、曹石连告诉我说：“上级发了两百元，以后看你干得怎样再说”。三千元变成了两百元，这且不说；他们又七折八扣地除去“佣金”，临走时我根本没有见到钱。李思咏只拿出一只金戒指，丘谦拿出一支手表就算完事，共约折合港币五十元。我起程前，“北方人”又来车站上给我布置了一番任务。
    一九五三年八月十一日，我回到惠阳安墩珠湖乡家里。全家的人都欢天喜地，乡亲们也来看我。我看到乡里一切都底面翻了个滚：地主的威风看不见了，过去的穷哥们有的当了代表，有的当了组长。我那个成天淌鼻涕到处乱跑的弟弟丘关邻，现在当了民兵，入了青年团，村里乡里的大事情都有他的份。我真高兴，这才是我们的政府啊！可是低头一想，我是什么人呢？我是特务，是人民的敌人，想到这里，我便恨不得死了算了。
  弟弟和母亲带我到牛棚里看大水牛，到村后看
  一大片水田，说这都是土地改革后分给我家的。又说，住的房子也是我们自己的了。弟弟要我回家来领导生产。我想，过去我们房无一间，地无一垅，今天有房有地又分到耕牛，这好处是谁给我们的呢？是共产党、毛主席。但是，我是什么人呢？是共产党和人民的敌人！我真惭愧得要死。
    有好几次，我都想跟弟弟谈谈我被骗参加特务组织的事情，总觉得难以出口。后来又想直接找乡干部谈，又怕被人民政府法办。以后便自己安慰自己：“只要不干特务的事，好好生产，把事情阴消过去算了。”就这样，我背上一个千斤重担，参加了乡里的生产。
    在乡里，我在大会小会上都不敢讲话。别人讲话时，都好像是冲着我说的，我时常胆战心惊；又怕别人看出我有问题，更故作镇定。这日子太苦了，真不是人过的。
    我常常痛苦万分地考虑自己的问题：到底怎样结局呢？就这样隐瞒到底吗？如果被发觉了怎么办？参加特务组织的不止我一个人，我不说人家说了怎么办？即使现在不被发觉，将来发觉了怎么办？就算有天大的侥幸，一辈子不被发觉，但是我的名字还在蒋匪特务机关的名单上，我到底算是共产党的人呢？还是蒋匪帮的人呢？就这样带着一个万恶的特务罪名进棺材吗？我常常给自己提出的一个接一个的问题弄得寝食不安。这时，突然发生了一件天旋地转的大事，陈佛林被紫金县人民政府法办了！布告贴到惠阳县来了。陈佛林是我同厂工人，同时从香港回来，我们同时在火车站接受特务机关最后交代的任务。天哪！我也只有这样一个结局吗？
      一九五四年十一月底，县公安局巫同志到我乡来开会，会上讲到人民政府对反革命分子的政策，说是抗拒从严，坦白从宽，一切反革命分子，只有坦白自首才有出路。听了这次报告，我好几夜睡不着觉。到十一月二十三日，天刚亮，我实在别不下去了，便下定决心：“坦白了就是死，我也不管了。”我到乡人民委员会找到了巫同志，向他吞吞吐吐讲了我参加特务组织的经过。巫同志看我太紧张，顾虑很大，没有全部坦白，又对我详细讲解政策，要我彻底交代。我经过多次的思想斗争，才把我参加特务组织的全部经过情况交代清楚。
    交代清楚以后，我的思想轻松了很多，我准备接受人民政府的任何处分。后来人民政府不但没有处分我，还鼓励我好好生产，要我将功赎罪。
    这半年来，我们的生产搞得不错，获得了丰收，我家除去一切开销，收获了一千五百斤粮食，这是从来未有过的。但是这还不够得很，我一定要更加努力搞好生产。　（巫玉记）
