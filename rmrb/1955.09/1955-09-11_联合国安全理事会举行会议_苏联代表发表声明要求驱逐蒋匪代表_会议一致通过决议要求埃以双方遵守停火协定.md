Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 10th: According to TASS, the United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 8th at the request of the British, French, and American delegations to discuss the recent clashes between Egyptian and Israeli forces on the Egyptian-Israeli border.

    At the beginning of the meeting, the Soviet representative, Sobolev, made a statement regarding the fact that the Kuomintang representative was illegally acting as the chairman of the Security Council. He said: The Soviet delegation deems it necessary to declare that the Soviet delegation cannot recognize a person who represents no one but only himself as the legal representative of China and the chairman of the Security Council.

    Only the representative appointed by the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative of the Chinese people in the United Nations, including its important part, the Security Council.

    Sobolev continued: Such an abnormal situation, in which the representative of the bankrupt Kuomintang clique occupies a seat in the Security Council instead of the legal representative of great China, damages the reputation and international prestige of the United Nations. It is time to end this intolerable situation and allow the People's Republic of China to take its rightful seat in the Security Council and other organizations of the United Nations.

    After the Security Council adopted the agenda – “The Palestine Question: Ending Hostile Actions and Taking Measures to Prevent Further Incidents in the Gaza Area” – the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France, who had proposed a draft resolution on the issue under discussion, spoke.

    The draft of the three countries was supported by the representatives of New Zealand, Iran, Peru, and Belgium. The Israeli and Egyptian representatives stated that their governments were ready to work with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine to prevent new incidents in the Israeli-Egyptian border area.

    In his speech, the Soviet representative, Sobolev, pointed out that the clashes between the armed forces of Egypt and Israel on the border between the two countries were serious. He said that the Soviet delegation supported the draft resolution submitted by the United States, Britain, and France to the Security Council, believing that this draft resolution was a supplement to the resolution unanimously adopted by the Security Council on March 30, 1955.

    The Security Council unanimously passed the draft resolution proposed by the British, French, and American delegations. This resolution requires both parties to take all necessary measures to establish order and tranquility in the area, especially to exercise restraint and refrain from taking further violent actions, and to continue to abide by the ceasefire agreement. The resolution also requires that UN inspectors in the area be given freedom of movement so that they can fulfill their duties. In addition, the resolution also requires both parties to send representatives to meet with and cooperate with the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine.

    联合国安全理事会举行会议
    苏联代表发表声明要求驱逐蒋匪代表
    会议一致通过决议要求埃以双方遵守停火协定
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社纽约九日讯：联合国安全理事会应英国、法国和美国代表团的请求，在八日举行会议，讨论最近埃及和以色列军队在埃及—以色列边境发生冲突的事件。
    会议开始时，苏联代表索波列夫就国民党代表非法担任安全理事会主席一事发表了声明。他说：苏联代表团认为有必要声明：苏联代表团不可能承认一个并不代表任何人而只代表他自己的人为中国的合法代表和安全理事会的主席。
    只有中华人民共和国政府委派的代表，才是中国人民在联合国，包括它的重要部分如安全理事会中的唯一合法代表。
    索波列夫接着说：在安全理事会中占有席位的是破产的国民党集团的代表，而不是伟大的中国的合法代表，这样一种不正常的情况损害了联合国的声望和国际威信。现在已经是结束这样一种不可容忍的情况并且使中华人民共和国取得安全理事会和联合国其他组织中应当属于它的席位的时候了。
    在安全理事会通过了议程——“巴勒斯坦问题：结束敌对行动和采取防止在加沙地区再发生事件的措施”——之后，对讨论中的问题提出决议草案的英国、美国和法国的代表发了言。
    三国草案得到新西兰、伊朗、秘鲁和比利时代表的支持。以色列和埃及代表表示，他们的政府准备同在巴勒斯坦的联合国停战监察委员会一道努力，来防止以色列—埃及边境地区发生新的事件。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中指出：埃及和以色列武装部队在两国边境上冲突的事件是严重的。他说，苏联代表团支持美国、英国和法国向安全理事会提出的决议草案，它认为这项决议草案是对安全理事会在一九五五年三月三十日一致通过的决议的补充。
    安全理事会一致通过了英国、法国和美国代表团提出的决议草案。这项决议要求双方采取一切必要措施，以便在这个地区建立秩序和安宁，特别是要求双方克制，不得再采取暴力行动，而继续遵守停火协定。决议并且要求给联合国驻这个地区的视察员以行动自由，以便他们能够履行职责。此外，决议还要求双方派代表同联合国驻巴勒斯坦停战监察组织参谋长举行会议，并且同他合作。
