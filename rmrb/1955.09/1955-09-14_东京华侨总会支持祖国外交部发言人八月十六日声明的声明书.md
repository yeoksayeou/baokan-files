Statement from the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association Supporting the August 16th Statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, September 1st: The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association issued a statement on September 1st supporting the statement made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on August 16th. The full text of the statement from the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association is as follows:

    I. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on August 16, 1955, regarding the note from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated July 15, 1955, and the public announcement of July 16th of the same year. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China stated in this statement: "Now the Japanese government is making unfounded accusations of 'no progress in the issue of repatriating Japanese nationals'. On the contrary, China has tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Japan whose legitimate rights and interests have not been properly taken care of. Their contact with their motherland and families is still being obstructed, and they do not have the convenience of returning to their country. It is clear that in the issue of nationals of China and Japan, it is not the issue of Japanese nationals that needs to be negotiated and resolved, but rather the issue of Chinese nationals." The statement also said: "More importantly, during the war of aggression against China by Japanese militarists, tens of millions of Chinese people were massacred, and millions of US dollars worth of Chinese public and private property were lost. Tens of thousands of Chinese people were kidnapped to Japan to be enslaved and killed. The Japanese government should understand that the Chinese people have the right to demand compensation for the huge losses they suffered. Now, the Japanese government has not only failed to provide any explanation for these circumstances but has also groundlessly demanded that China account for the so-called issue of 40,000 people, which cannot but make people suspect the motives of the Japanese government in raising this issue."

    The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association confirms that the accusations made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the above statement regarding the issue of overseas Chinese in Japan and the issue of tens of thousands of Chinese people being kidnapped to Japan during the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War to be enslaved and killed are completely correct, and hereby issues the following statement.

    II. Regarding the issue of Overseas Chinese in Japan

    A. From the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, until 1952, the rights and freedom of overseas Chinese in Japan to return to their glorious motherland – the People's Republic of China – were completely deprived. It was not until after January 1953 that overseas Chinese in Japan were able to overcome numerous obstacles to return to their country. After the Xinhua News Agency released news on December 1, 1952, regarding Japanese nationals in China, representatives of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association orally requested the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 8th and 10th, 1953, to provide convenience for overseas Chinese in Japan who wished to return to their country to board Japanese ships sailing between Chinese and Japanese ports, in order to send back overseas Chinese in Japan who wished to return. On January 12th of the same year, a written request was made to the Japanese Red Cross Society, requesting that the society make a similar request to the Japanese government. It was not until June 6, 1953, that the Japanese government had to agree to allow overseas Chinese in Japan to board the aforementioned ships going to China. Prior to this, twelve Japanese ships had sailed to China, and 14,550 Japanese nationals in China had returned home. Since then, until March 1955, only six ships have provided this convenience for overseas Chinese in Japan who wished to return home. To this day, overseas Chinese in Japan have repeatedly used merchant ships to return to the People's Republic of China, but they have not received any convenience. The free communication between overseas Chinese in Japan and their motherland is still being obstructed, and their contact with their families is also being hindered. Even requests from overseas Chinese in Japan to return home for the funerals of relatives have not been permitted. On the other hand, the number of Japanese Diet members, academics, cultural figures, workers, youth, women, and other representatives who have visited the People's Republic of China has reached 500 to date. Overseas Chinese in Japan love their motherland and choose and support their own government, which is their inherent right, but Japanese government officials have repeatedly interfered with this as if it were a crime. To this day, representatives of various people's organizations in China have visited Japan several times. However, the Chiang Kai-shek's organization stationed in Japan has repeatedly threatened overseas Chinese in Japan who welcome these representatives, saying that if anyone goes to welcome them, the Japanese government will revoke their residency status and forcibly deport them from Japan. The Japanese government is well aware of this fact but remains silent, thereby supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique in using the Japanese government to carry out sabotage.

    B. The fact that diplomatic and consular relations have not been established between the government of the People's Republic of China and the Japanese government has become a great pain for overseas Chinese in Japan. Overseas Chinese in Japan have been refused by the Japanese government in handling marriage, inheritance, and other legal procedures regarding their identity in accordance with Japanese laws and customs. The land and buildings located at 1-1 Koishikawa-cho, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo – the Chinese Students' Association Hall (formerly the "Manchuria Hall") – are Chinese property and should be returned to the government of the People's Republic of China, but not only has this not been done, but the residential rights of Chinese people in the hall are being seriously threatened. On the pretext of fabricated criminal suspicions and fictional criminal suspects, incidents of Japanese government officials violating the residences of overseas Chinese in Japan, as well as searches and arrests that trample on basic human rights, have occurred repeatedly. The search of Yuelaizhuang at 32 Tsukiji, Akishima City, Tokyo on February 1, 1951, and the search of the aforementioned Chinese Students' Association Hall are typical events, and both were carried out under the encirclement of hundreds of armed police officers. On November 15, 1953, Zhang Zhentao, an overseas Chinese in Japan, was killed in Ishioka Town, Tochigi Prefecture by a man claiming to be named Minoru Kubota. Although the Japanese police authorities knew the identity of the victim in detail, they ended the case under the pretext of an unidentified person. On August 1, 1952, an incident occurred at Yokohama Chinese School (142 Yamashita-cho, Naka-ku, Yokohama) in which armed Japanese police forcibly ordered the faculty and students of the school to evacuate the school site. The Japanese government must bear the responsibility for these illegal acts. Overseas Chinese in Japan are forced to bear far more obligations than Japanese people, but they do not enjoy various rights such as protection of life, loans for production funds, and loans for housing funds.

    The above irrefutable facts clearly illustrate the situation of overseas Chinese in Japan.

    III. Regarding the Issue of Tens of Thousands of Chinese People Being Kidnapped to Japan During the War to Be Enslaved and Killed

    A. According to the "Investigation Report on the Employment of Chinese Laborers" issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 1, Showa 21 (1946), which is in the possession of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, the number of Chinese people kidnapped to Japan for enslavement, including combatants, reached 38,935, and the number of those killed reached 6,830. The Japanese government has not provided any explanation for this issue, which is an undeniable fact, but now it claims that it does not have any information.

    B. Not only that, but the Japanese government has been obstructing the efforts of Japanese citizens and overseas Chinese in Japan, based on the ardent desire for peace and friendship between China and Japan and out of humanitarian spirit, to investigate and collect the remains of the victims. Since February 23, 1953, when a delegation of three organizations – the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council – proposed to the Chinese Red Cross Society in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, to return the ashes of these martyrs, the matter has been delayed for five months due to the Japanese government's lack of sincerity and its refusal to accept humanitarian principles. It was not until July 1953 that the ashes were returned by the Japanese Red Cross ship "Kuroshio Maru".

    C. Subsequently, until November 1954, ashes were returned a total of four times, but the Japanese government has never been seen to have a sincere attitude. To date, the Japanese government has never shown a responsible attitude towards investigating, collecting, and returning ashes.

    IV. In recent years, the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan have been strengthening day by day. We, the overseas Chinese in Japan, are heartily delighted with this ever-increasing friendly relationship, but this situation does not mean that the relations between the two countries have been normalized and that all issues have been satisfactorily resolved. As the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China pointed out in the statement: "Today, there are indeed many major issues related to the interests of the people of both countries between China and Japan. For example, developing normal trade between China and Japan, promoting mutual exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan, and properly handling the legitimate rights and interests of nationals of both China and Japan are all issues that need to be resolved by the governments of China and Japan." The statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China concludes: "If the Japanese government is truly sincere in seeking a way to normalize relations between China and Japan, it should start with these issues," and clearly states that "the Chinese government is prepared to negotiate with the Japanese government on these issues." The overseas Chinese in Japan express their full support for this statement and deeply hope that the governments of the two countries will begin negotiations as soon as possible based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the interests of the people of both countries.

    东京华侨总会支持祖国外交部发言人八月十六日声明的声明书
    新华社讯　东京华侨总会九月一日发表声明书支持中华人民共和国外交部发言人八月十六日的声明。东京华侨总会的声明书全文如下：
    一、中华人民共和国外交部发言人于一九五五年八月十六日就日本外务省一九五五年七月十五日照会和同年七月十六日公报，发表了声明。中华人民共和国外交部发言人在此声明中说：“现在日本政府竟提出所谓‘撤侨问题再没有进展’的指责，这是毫无根据的。相反的，中国在日本有数万侨民，他们的正当权益并未得到应有的照顾。他们同祖国和家庭的联系还受着阻挠，他们更没有回国的便利。可见在中日两国侨民问题上，应该谈判解决的并不是日本侨民问题，倒是中国侨民问题。”该声明又说：“更重要的是日本军国主义者在侵略中国的战争期间，曾经使千万以上的中国人民遭受屠杀，数百万万美元的中国公私财产遭受损失，并曾经将成千成万的中国人掳到日本去，加以奴役和杀害。日本政府应该了解，中国人民对于他们遭受的巨大损失，有权要求赔偿。现在日本政府不仅对于这些情况没有做过任何交代，而且无中生有地要求中国交代所谓四万人的问题，这不能不令人怀疑日本政府提出这个问题的动机。”
    东京华侨总会证实，中华人民共和国外交部发言人在上述声明中关于在日华侨问题和在中日战争及太平洋战争期间数万中国人被掳到日本遭受奴役和杀害的问题所作的指责是完全正确的，并发表声明如下。
    二、关于在日华侨问题
    甲、从一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立以来到一九五二年期间，在日华侨返回自己的光荣祖国——中华人民共和国的权利与自由完全被剥夺了。直到一九五三年一月以后，在日华侨才能够排除重重障碍返回祖国。一九五二年十二月一日新华通讯社发表了关于在华日侨的消息以后，东京华侨总会的代表在一九五三年一月八日和十日口头向日本外务省提出，要求给予希望回国的在日华侨以搭乘航行于中日两国港口间的日本船只的便利，以便送回希望归国的在日华侨。又在同年一月十二日以书面要求日本红十字会，请该会向日本政府提出同样内容的要求。直到一九五三年六月六日，日本政府才不得不同意在日华侨搭乘上述前往中国的船只，而在此以前，已有十二艘次的日本船只航行中国，并有一万四千五百五十名在华日侨回国。此后，到一九五五年三月为止，希望回国的在日华侨得到这种便利而搭乘的船只仅有六艘次。到今天为止在日华侨曾多次利用商船返回中华人民共和国，然而他们也没有得到任何便利。在日华侨和祖国的自由往来迄今仍受到阻挠，他们和家庭的联系也遭到阻碍。甚至在日华侨为殡葬亲属而要求回乡也未被允许。但在另一方面，访问中华人民共和国的日本国会、学术界、文化界、工人、青年、妇女及其他代表到今天为止已达五百名。在日华侨爱护自己的祖国，选择并支持自己的政府是他们固有的权利，但日本政府官吏们竟对此视同罪行而横加干涉的事件是不胜枚举的。到今天为止，中国各人民团体的代表几次访问了日本。而蒋介石驻日机关竟反复恫吓欢迎这些代表的在日华侨说，如果有人去欢迎，将由日本政府取消其居留资格，并强制离开日本。日本政府明知这一事实却默不作声，从而支持了利用日本政府的蒋介石集团进行破坏工作。
    乙、中华人民共和国政府和日本政府之间没有建立外交和领事关系，现已成为在日华侨的很大痛苦。在日华侨根据日本法律习惯办理婚姻、继承以及其他关于身份上的各种法律手续，遭到了日本政府的拒绝。位于东京文京区小石川町一丁目一番地的土地和该地的建筑物——中华学友会馆（前“满洲会馆”）系中国的财产，现应交还中华人民共和国政府，但是不仅没有这样作，而且在该会馆内的中国人居住权正遭受着严重威胁。借口捏造的罪行嫌疑和虚构人物的犯罪嫌疑，屡次发生日本政府官吏侵犯在日华侨住宅的事件，以及搜查和逮捕等蹂躏基本人权的事件。一九五一年二月一日对东京都昭岛市筑地三十二番地悦来庄所进行的搜查，以及对上述中华学友会馆的搜查是典型性的事件，而且都是在数百名武装警察包围之下进行的。一九五三年十一月十五日，在日华侨张振桃在櫔木县石冈町大字石冈九百二十番地为自称名字叫洼田实的人所杀害。虽然日本警察当局详细了解被害人的身份，但却以身份不明的口实而不了了之。一九五二年八月一日，在横滨中华学校（横滨市中区山下町一百四十二番地）发生了日本武装警察用武力勒令该校教职员和学生撤出该校校址的事件。日本政府对于这些非法行为必须承担理应承担的责任。在日华侨被迫担负着远多于日本人的义务，但却没有享受保护生活、借贷生产资金、借贷住宅资金等等的各种权利。
    上述无所辩驳的事实明显地说明了在日华侨的处境。
    三、关于数万中国人在战争期间被掳到日本遭受奴役和杀害的问题
    甲、根据东京华侨总会掌握的日本外务省昭和二十一年（一九四六年）三月一日发布的“华人劳务者就劳事情调查报告书”事，被掳到日本受奴役的中国人包括作战人员在内达三万八千九百三十五名，被杀害者达六千八百三十名。日本政府对这一问题没有作过任何解释，已是无可掩饰的事实，然而现竟声称没有掌握任何资料。
    乙、不仅如此，日本政府一直在阻挠日本国民和在日华侨基于中日之间和平友好的热烈愿望和从人道主义精神出发而进行的对被害者遗骨的调查、收集的努力。自从一九五三年二月二十三日，日本红十字会、日本中国友好协会、日本和平联络会等三团体的代表团在中华人民共和国首都北京，对中国红十字会提议送还这些殉难者的骨灰以来，由于日本政府没有诚意，不接受人道主义原则，而遭拖延了五个月的时间。直到一九五三年七月才由日本红十字会船只“黑潮丸”送还骨灰。
    丙、其后截至一九五四年十一月为止，共送还骨灰四次，但从未看到日本政府抱有诚意的态度。截至目前为止，日本政府从未对调查、收集及送还骨灰表示负责的态度。
    四、最近数年来，中日两国人民间的友好关系正在日益加强，我们在日华侨对这种不断增进的友好关系感到衷心的喜悦，但这种情形并不意味着两国的关系已经正常，各项问题已得到圆满的解决。正如中华人民共和国外交部发言人在声明中指出的：“今天，在中日两国之间倒确实存在着许多有关两国人民利益的重大问题。例如，发展中日两国的正常贸易，促进中日两国人民的互相往来，妥善处理中日两国侨民的正当权益，这些都是需要中日两国政府来解决的问题。”中华人民共和国外交部发言人的声明最后说：“如果日本政府真正具有诚意来寻求中日两国关系正常化的途径，就应该从这些问题着手”，并明确表示“中国政府是准备就这些问题同日本政府进行谈判”的。在日华侨对这个声明表示完全支持，并且深盼两国政府本着和平五项原则和两国人民的利益，早日开始谈判。

                          一九五五年九月一日
