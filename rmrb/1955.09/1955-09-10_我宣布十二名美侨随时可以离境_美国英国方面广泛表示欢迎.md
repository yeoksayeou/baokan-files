Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Washington Dispatch: The notification by the Chinese side to the American side during the Sino-American ambassadorial talks that twelve American nationals in China may leave at any time has been met with widespread welcome in the United States.

White House Assistant Press Secretary Snyder told reporters on the 7th that U.S. President Eisenhower was "very pleased" with this measure by the Chinese government. The day before, a State Department spokesman said it was "encouraging."

Many newspapers reacted to this measure by the Chinese government with "relief and satisfaction." The Washington "Star" and the "Philadelphia Inquirer" both said it was a "welcome development." The "New York Times" said in an editorial that "this situation will help ease tensions in the Far East." Many newspapers also published the words of relatives of those Americans who are about to return home, expressing relief and joy at this measure by the Chinese government.

However, some newspapers continue to slander China, attempting to diminish the positive significance of this measure. For example, the aforementioned "New York Times" avoids mentioning the specific situations of those Americans who have already been released or are about to return home, and insists that China was "obligated" to release them in the first place.

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, London Dispatch: The British "Daily Express," commenting on the Chinese government's decision to allow a group of American citizens to leave the country, pointed out that this was the "second major move" made by the People's Republic of China. The newspaper also recounted that when the Sino-American ambassadorial talks initially began in Geneva, China released eleven American airmen. The newspaper asked, "What is the United States prepared to offer in response?"

In addition, some other British newspapers also published comments stating that this measure by the Chinese government proves China's sincerity in the negotiations.

    我宣布十二名美侨随时可以离境
    美国英国方面广泛表示欢迎
    新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：在中美两国大使级会谈中，中国方面向美国方面提出的十二名在华美侨可以随时离境的通知，在美国引起了广泛的欢迎。
    白宫助理新闻秘书斯奈德七日对新闻记者说，美国总统艾森豪威尔对中国政府的这一措施“感到非常高兴”。在前一天，国务院一位发言人说这是“令人鼓舞的”。
    许多报纸对中国政府这一措施的反应是感到“宽慰和满意”。华盛顿“明星报”和“费城问询报”都说这是“可欢迎的发展”。“纽约时报”在社论中说，“这种情况将有助于缓和远东紧张局势”。许多报纸还刊载了那些将要回国的美国人的亲属对中国政府这一措施表示宽慰和高兴的话。
    但是，有些报纸同时又继续对中国进行污蔑，企图削弱这一措施的积极意义。例如上述“纽约时报”就对那些已经被释或者将要回国的美国人的具体情况避而不谈，而硬说中国本来就“有义务”释放他们。
    新华社九日讯　伦敦消息：英国“每日快报”在评论中国政府决定允许一批美国公民离境时指出，这是中华人民共和国作出的“第二个重大的举动”。这家报纸并且追述说，当中美大使级会谈起初在日内瓦开始时，中国就释放了十一名美国空军人员。这家报纸问道：“美国准备拿什么来作为回答呢？”
    另外还有一些英国报纸也发表了评论，认为中国政府的这一措施证明了中国在谈判中的诚意。
