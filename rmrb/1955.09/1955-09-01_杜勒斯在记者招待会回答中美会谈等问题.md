Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 31st:  U.S. Secretary of State Dulles answered several questions posed by reporters at a press conference on the 30th.

    When asked if he felt encouraged by the progress of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, Dulles said he "didn't feel any encouragement, just that people felt that some results would eventually come of it." Dulles added that the talks "discuss small, minor issues every day." He said the United States "must be patient" with the talks.

    In answering questions, Dulles again expressed the U.S.'s support for the Lee Seung-man group's position of undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and abolishing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He said he agreed that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be abolished, or that its activities should be limited to staying within the Korean Demilitarized Zone and receiving reports there.

    Dulles also reiterated the U.S.'s support for the Ngo Dinh Diem group's destructive attitude of obstructing the free general elections in Vietnam as stipulated by the Geneva Accords. He said that France and Britain hoped to make Ngo Dinh Diem more interested in holding elections than he is now. However, the United States, like Ngo Dinh Diem, also believes that "conditions are not yet suitable for holding free elections." To defend this untenable position, he again spread the slander that "there is no possibility of free elections" in North Vietnam.

    Dulles also talked about his views on the development of the spirit of the Geneva Conference of the heads of the four governments. He said that the meeting of the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which reconvened on August 29, was the first test of the spirit of the Geneva Conference. Dulles believes that the Geneva Conference should not be seen as an end, but merely as a beginning.

    When talking about the situation in North Africa, Dulles indicated that there was "no need" to consider the Moroccan situation at the United Nations General Assembly next month, although representatives of Asian and African countries are currently preparing to again accuse French colonialists of atrocities in North Africa at the United Nations General Assembly.

    杜勒斯在记者招待会回答中美会谈等问题
    新华社三十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯三十日在记者招待会上答复了记者提出的一些问题。
    有人问杜勒斯是否对中美大使级会谈中的进展感到鼓舞，杜勒斯说，他“没有感到任何鼓舞，只是人们觉得最后终会产生某些结果的”。杜勒斯又说，会谈“每天都讨论一些小的次要的问题”。他说美国对会谈“必须要有耐心”。
    杜勒斯在回答问题时再次表示美国支持李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战协定、取消中立国监察委员会的立场。他说，他同意中立国监察委员会应当取消，或者它的活动只限于留在朝鲜非军事区内和在那里接收报告。
    杜勒斯也重申美国支持吴庭艳集团阻挠日内瓦协议所规定的在越南举行自由普选的破坏性态度。他说，法国和英国希望使吴庭艳对举行选举比现在有兴趣一些。但是，美国和吴庭艳一样，也认为“条件还不适于举行自由选举”。为了替这种站不住脚的立场辩护，他再次发出北越“没有自由选举的可能”的谰言。
    杜勒斯还谈到他对四国政府首脑日内瓦会议精神的发展的看法。他说，八月二十九日复会的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议是日内瓦会议精神的第一个考验。杜勒斯认为，日内瓦会议绝对不能被看成是一个结束，它仅仅是一个开始。
    杜勒斯在谈到北非局势时，表示在下月举行的联合国大会，“没有必要”考虑摩洛哥局势问题，虽然亚非国家的代表目前正在准备再次向联合国大会提出控诉法国殖民主义者在北非的暴行的问题。
