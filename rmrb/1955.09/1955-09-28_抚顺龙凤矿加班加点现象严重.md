To the Editor:

Recently, we inspected the work of increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing waste at the Fushun Longfeng Mine, and found that the overtime work phenomenon at this mine is very serious.

From January to July 1955, the recorded overtime work hours at Longfeng Mine reached more than 146,000 hours (excluding overtime figures from basic construction units); and many of these were illegal overtime hours without pay. For example, on July 25th, the Xin Yi class of the backfilling team of the 0526 working face in the 52nd district worked 16 hours overtime, and the coal mining team also worked 8 hours overtime to deal with roof collapses. These were handled by not inspecting and not issuing tickets on the day, but adding the output to other working days. In the 61st district, the 612 working face had an average of 12 to 13 times per month of working more than two hours overtime. In the 22nd district, the 221 working face had an average of about 14 times per month of working more than two hours overtime.

This serious overtime work phenomenon has caused extremely bad consequences, affecting the workers' health and increasing accidents. Here are some relevant figures: The total number of workdays lost due to sick leave in the entire mine was more than 5,700 in January, more than 6,900 in February, more than 7,800 in March, more than 8,000 in April and May, and increased again to more than 9,000 in June and July. In terms of accidents, there were 73 mechanical and electrical accidents in April, 79 in May, and the number increased to 114 in June, affecting production stoppage time for a total of more than 8,000 hours; personal accidents occurred 45 times in April, 60 times in May, and reached 75 times in June.

Why is the overtime work phenomenon so serious? The main reason is that the mine's leaders still have a wrong understanding of overtime work. For example, District Chief Yu of the 52nd district said: "If the work is not finished, you have to work overtime!" A certain leader once openly instructed the workers at a dispatch meeting: "If you don't complete the task, you will be asked to go down again even if you return to the pithead, and you will be criticized when you come up." In order to complete the production tasks, they do not implement national labor laws and arbitrarily let workers work overtime. In addition, the mine's trade union turns a blind eye to this wrong practice of the administrative side and does not offer opinions, which is also one of the reasons why the overt and covert overtime work phenomenon has existed in the mine for a long time.

### 抚顺龙凤矿加班加点现象严重

    抚顺龙凤矿加班加点现象严重编辑同志：
    最近，我们检查了抚顺龙凤矿的增产节约、反对浪费的工作，发现这个矿的加班加点现象十分严重。
    从一九五五年一月到七月，龙凤矿有账可查的加班加点的工时达到十四万六千多小时（还不包括基本建设单位的加班加点数字）；而其中还有不少是不给工资的非法的加点。如七月二十五日，五二区○五二六掌子充填班新一班加点十六小时，采煤小组处理冒顶也加点八小时，这些都是用当天光验收不开票、而将产量加到别的工作日的办法处理的。六一区六一二掌子加点两小时以上的每月平均就有十二次到十三次。二二区二二一掌子加点两小时以上的每月平均有十四次左右。
    这种严重的加班加点现象，造成了极大的恶果，影响了工人的身体健康，加多了事故。下面是一些有关的数字：全矿因病假歇工的，一月份有五千七百多个工，二月份有六千九百多个工，三月份有七千八百多个工，四、五月份都是八千多个工，六、七月份又增加到九千多个工。在事故方面，机电事故四月份发生七十三次，五月份七十九次，六月份增加到一百一十四次，影响停止生产的时间共八千多小时；人身事故，四月份发生四十五次，五月份六十次，六月份就达到七十五次。
    为什么加班加点现象这么严重呢？主要原因是矿里的领导人员对加班加点还有一种错误的认识。如五二区于区长说：“工作完不了，就得加班加点！”某一个领导人员在调度会上曾公开向工人布置说：“你们完不成任务，回到坑口也得叫你们再下去，上来就受批评。”他们为了完成生产任务，就不执行国家劳动法令，任意让工人加班加点。另外，矿上工会对行政方面这种错误做法，熟视无睹，不提出意见，也是矿里明的暗的加班加点现象长期存在的原因之一。
