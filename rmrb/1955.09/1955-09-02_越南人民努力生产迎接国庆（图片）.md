The Gia Lam Locomotive Repair Factory is one of Vietnam's important state-owned enterprises. The factory was severely damaged when the French troops withdrew. The workers overcame various difficulties and quickly restored production. To welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day, the workers launched a labor competition, and their work efficiency has increased by one to two times compared to the past. The picture shows a female apprentice working under the guidance of an old worker at the factory. (All photos are taken by Du Zhanchao, our correspondent in Vietnam)

Hong Gai Coal Mine, the largest coal mining industrial center in Vietnam, spans over 120 kilometers and contains rich reserves of high-quality anthracite coal. Since the mine was taken over by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on April 22 this year, it has been actively restoring production, and production has continued to increase. The picture shows workers using a coal mining machine to mine coal.

The Vietnamese people have restored all six famous major water conservancy projects in the north. After the restoration of these water conservancy projects, they can irrigate many rice fields. The picture shows the Tuo Kuang sluice gate of the Cau River Water Conservancy Project, one of the six major water conservancy projects.

By the beginning of July this year, land reform had been completed in 735 villages in seven provinces of Vietnam, eliminating the feudal exploitation system. Millions of farmers were distributed land, cattle, and farming tools. In these areas, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. The picture shows farmers in Xishan Township, Shanxi Province, mutually assisting each other in cultivating autumn rice on the distributed land.

    越南人民努力生产迎接国庆
    嘉林机车修理厂是越南的重要国营企业之一，这个工厂在法军撤退时遭到严重破坏，工人们克服种种困难，迅速恢复了生产。为迎接国庆十周年，工人们展开了劳动竞赛，工作效率较过去提高一至二倍。图为该厂女徒工在老工人指导下工作。　（照片均为本报驻越南记者杜展潮摄）
    越南最大的煤矿工业中心——鸿基煤矿，矿区长达一百二十多公里，蕴藏有丰富的优质无烟煤。今年四月二十二日由越南民主共和国接管这个煤矿后积极恢复生产，生产量不断增加。图为工人用挖煤机挖煤。
    越南人民已将北方著名的六大水利工程全部修复，这些水利工程修复后可以灌溉许多稻田。图为六大水利工程之一——桥江水利工程的拓况水闸。
    越南七个省的七百三十五个乡，到今年七月初已完成土地改革，消灭了封建剥削制度，上百万的农民分得了土地、耕牛和农具，在这些地区，农民生产的积极性空前高涨。图为山西省西山乡农民在分配的土地上互助耕种秋稻。
