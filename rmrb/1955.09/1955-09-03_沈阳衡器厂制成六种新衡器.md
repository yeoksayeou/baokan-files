    Shenyang Weighing Instrument Factory Manufactures Six New Types of Weighing Instruments
    The employees of the local state-owned Shenyang Weighing Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced six new types of weighing instruments in the first half of the year: electric track scales for heavy industry, automatic cumulative quantitative scales, electric rest device scales, overhead automatic batching scales for light industry and basic construction departments, electric mercury switch scales, and automatic cement silo scales. These products, after appraisal, have proven to be of good quality.
    These new weighing instruments are all automated, something our country had not manufactured before. For example, the electric track scales manufactured for Anshan Iron and Steel Company can immediately record the weight of each car on an electric typewriter as trains loaded with steel and ore pass over the scales at a speed of fifteen kilometers per hour. Previously, Ansteel used manually operated automatic tracks, and each weighing required the train to stop on the scales for thirty to fifty minutes. Now, with the electric track scales, manpower is saved, and the speed of shunting is accelerated. The overhead automatic batching scales manufactured for Dalian Glass Factory can weigh eight different raw materials at a time without the need for people to load and unload materials or watch the scales. In the past, Dalian Glass Factory used ordinary platform scales to weigh raw materials, which could only weigh one type at a time and required many workers to transport materials onto the scales. At the same time, due to the poor precision of ordinary platform scales, raw materials were often mixed up, causing quality accidents; and the health of the material handling workers was often affected by the irritant nature of the raw materials. The use of overhead automatic batching scales overcomes these shortcomings.

    沈阳衡器厂制成六种新衡器
    地方国营沈阳衡器厂的职工，上半年试制成功六种新衡器：重工业用的电动轨道衡、自动累加定量秤、电动休息装置秤，轻工业和基本建设部门用的架空自动配料秤、电动水银开关秤、自动水泥罐秤。这些产品，经鉴定证明，质量良好。
    这些新衡器都是自动化的，过去我国都没有制造过。如为鞍山钢铁公司制造的电动轨道衡，只要装载钢材和矿石的火车用每小时十五公里的速度从秤上驶过，电动打字记录立刻就把每节车的重量记录下来。从前，鞍钢使用由人力操纵的自动轨道，每秤一次，火车要在秤上停三十到五十分钟。现在改用电动轨道衡，节省了人力，加快了调车速度。为大连玻璃厂制造的架空自动配料秤，一秤一次可磅八种不同的原料，而且不用人装卸原料，不用人看秤。大连玻璃厂过去用普通台秤磅原料，一次只能磅一种，还需要许多工人往秤上运送。同时，因普通台秤精密度较差，往往使原料对错，造成质量事故；因原料有刺激性，运料工人的健康也常受到影响。使用架空自动配料秤，便克服了这些缺点。
