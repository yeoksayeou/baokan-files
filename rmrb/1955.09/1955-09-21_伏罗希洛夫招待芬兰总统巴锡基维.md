The purpose of our talks at the beginning was to ensure the further consolidation of the friendly ties between our two peoples. The decisions we made after the talks undoubtedly conform to this purpose. The agreement on extending the term of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance by twenty years, as well as the Soviet decision to return the naval base of Porkkala-Udd, leased under the Finnish Peace Treaty, to Finland ahead of schedule, vividly demonstrate the sincere friendship and trust in our two countries' relations. These decisions also mark a new and important stage in the development of Soviet-Finnish friendship.

    Paasikivi expressed his gratitude for the Soviet Union's friendship in his speech. He said that the results of our talks were good. We are pleased to determine the extension of the validity of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in 1948.
