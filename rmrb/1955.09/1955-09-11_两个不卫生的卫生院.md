    Two Unsanitary Hygiene Clinics
    (I) Editor:
    The sanitation work at the Taixian County Hygiene Clinic in Jiangsu Province is very poor. Swarms of flies buzz around in the wards; with a wave of your hand, they scatter everywhere with a "buzzing" sound. The most annoying thing is that when the food and tableware are brought to the table, the flies unceremoniously land on the rice and dishes. In a toilet north of the wards, there are two vats filled with gauze and cotton balls soaked with pus and blood, which have been neglected for a long time, resulting in a moldy and foul odor. The toilet also often contains patients' chamber pots, which no one is responsible for cleaning. The patients' quilts and pillows have a musty smell because they have not been washed for a long time; the mats are even moldy. There is also a stinking ditch in the hospital courtyard, filled with dirty and smelly black water all day long.

    Such a dirty hospital is rare. Many patients have repeatedly raised concerns, but they have not received due attention. Therefore, we suggest that the Health Department of the Taixian County People's Committee conduct a comprehensive inspection of the sanitation work at the Taixian County Hygiene Clinic and provide criticism and education to the hospital staff.

    (II) Editor:

    The Shulu County Hygiene Clinic in Hebei Province is a very dirty hospital. As soon as you enter the waiting room, flies swarm towards you as if welcoming a guest. The disinfection room not only has flies, but also maggots crawling out of the toilet. The hospital's toilet and kitchen are only about three zhang apart; if it weren't for a stove in one and a "Toilet" sign hanging at the entrance of the other, it would be hard to tell them apart. Staff members must constantly chase away flies while eating, or they might eat food and flies together. No wonder 30% of the hospital staff suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses.

    The unsanitary conditions at the Shulu County Hygiene Clinic are intolerable and must be rectified immediately.

    两个不卫生的卫生院
    （一）编辑同志：
    江苏省泰县卫生院的卫生工作搞得很差。病房里停着成群的苍蝇，只要一挥手就会“嗡”的一声满处飞奔；最讨厌的就是当饭菜碗筷搬到桌子上的时候，苍蝇就毫不客气地停到饭上和菜上。靠近病房北边的一个厕所里有两只缸，里面沤着带有脓血的纱布和棉花球，长期无人过问，结果发出了霉臭味。厕所里还常常放着病人的大小便盆，也没有人负责刷洗。病人的被子、枕头因为长期不洗，都有了霉味；席子居然生了霉。医院天井里还有一条臭水沟，终日积着又脏又臭的黑水。
    像这样肮脏的医院真是少见。很多病员虽然不断地提出意见，但是却没有引起应有的重视。因此，我们建议泰县人民委员会卫生科必须对泰县卫生院的卫生工作作一次全面检查，对医院工作人员给予批评和教育。

    （二）编辑同志：
    河北省束鹿县卫生院是一个十分肮脏的医院。你一走进候诊室，苍蝇就会像迎接客人似的扑面飞来。消毒室里不但有苍蝇，而且还有厕所里爬出来的蛆。卫生院的厕所和厨房相距不过三丈，要不是一个有锅台炉灶，一个门口挂着“厕所”，真叫人分不清楚。工作人员吃饭时必须不停地哄苍蝇，否则就可能把食物和苍蝇一起吃掉。难怪这个医院的工作人员得肠胃病的占全院人员的百分之三十。
    束鹿县卫生院这样不卫生的情况是令人不能容忍的，必须立即纠正。
