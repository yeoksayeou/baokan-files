Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: The remains of Comrade Kyuichi Tokuda, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, were escorted out of Guangzhou this morning by Yoshio Shiga, member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and Tokuda Tatsuko, wife of Kyuichi Tokuda, to return home. Takahashi Katsuyuki, editor-in-chief of the JCP's "Akahata" newspaper, accompanied them.

Tao Zhu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC, Zhao Ziyang, Lin Liming, Deputy Secretaries, Wang De, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC, as well as members of the Provincial Committee and cadres of the organs, a total of more than seventy people, went to the station to see them off. Yoshio Shiga, holding the remains of Kyuichi Tokuda, boarded the train as the band played the Internationale. The mourners solemnly bid farewell to Kyuichi Tokuda, a close friend of the Chinese people.

Li Chuli, a responsible staff member of the Central Committee of the CPC, Luo Keming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC, and others accompanied them to Shenzhen. Yoshio Shiga issued the following written statement upon leaving Shenzhen:

"As we are about to leave the People's Republic of China to return to Japan, we would like to say a few words to the Chinese people.

After we came to China to escort the remains of the late General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Comrade Kyuichi Tokuda, we were warmly received by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. A grand memorial service attended by people and organizations from all walks of life was held in Beijing, and memorial services were also held in Wuhan and Guangzhou. The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the family of Comrade Kyuichi Tokuda are sincerely grateful. Before we departed from Japan, because Japan and China had not yet restored diplomatic relations, we had no direct contact with the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, we did not know the details of Comrade Tokuda's illness and his final condition. Thanks to the great kindness of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we have learned about these circumstances in detail. After we return home, we will immediately report to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and inform the Japanese people.

Although our stay in China has been short, we have clearly seen the situation of the Chinese people carrying out socialist construction under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. We wish the Chinese people's socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party will develop more and more in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC held a memorial service on the morning of the 15th to deeply mourn Comrade Kyuichi Tokuda.

The temporary mourning hall for Comrade Kyuichi Tokuda was set up in the middle of the hall of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC.

The memorial service began at 9 a.m. Tao Zhu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC, and Wang De, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC, successively presented wreaths to the spirit. Those who also participated in the memorial service included Gu Dacun, Zhao Ziyang, and Lin Liming, Deputy Secretaries of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC, Zhao Wucheng, Second Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC, Zhu Guang and Zeng Zhi, Deputy Secretaries, and more than one hundred members of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, members of the Municipal Committee, and cadres.

    志贺义雄等接运德田球一遗骨离广州回国
    新华社广州十六日电  日本共产党总书记德田球一同志遗骨在十六日上午由日共中央委员志贺义雄和德田球一夫人德田达接运离开广州回国。日共“赤旗报”编辑局长高桥胜之同行。
    中共广东省委书记陶铸、副书记赵紫阳、林李明、中共广州市委书记王德以及省委委员和机关干部等共七十多人到车站送行。志贺义雄捧着德田球一遗骨在乐队奏着国际歌声中登上火车，送行人沉痛地向中国人民的亲密朋友德田球一作最后的告别。
    中共中央负责工作人员李初梨，中共广东省委副秘书长罗克明等陪送到达深圳。志贺义雄在离开深圳时发表书面谈话如下：
    “在快要离开中华人民共和国回日本的时候，我们想向中国人民说几句话。
    我们为了接运日本共产党已故总书记德田球一同志的遗骨来到中国之后，受到了中国共产党中央委员会的盛情招待。在北京举行了各界人民和团体参加的盛大的追悼大会，在武汉和广州也举行了吊唁仪式。日本共产党中央委员会和德田球一同志的家属衷心感激。在我们从日本动身以前，因为日中两国还没有恢复国交。我们和中国共产党没有直接的联系。因此，对于德田同志的病状和临终的情况知道得不清楚。这次由于中国共产党中央委员会的隆情厚谊，这些情况我们都详细地了解到了。我们回国后，将立即向日本共产党中央委员会报告并且告诉日本国民。
    我们在中国停留的时间虽然很短促，可是我们清楚地看到了中国人民在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下进行社会主义建设的情形。我们祝中国人民在中国共产党领导下所进行的社会主义建设今后日益发展。”
    新华社广州十六日电  中共广东省委员会十五日上午举行吊唁式，沉痛哀悼德田球一同志。
    德田球一同志临时灵堂设在中共广东省委员会大厅中间。
    上午九时吊唁式开始，由中共广东省委书记陶铸、中共广州市委书记王德相继到灵前敬献花圈。同时参加吊唁的还有中共广东省委副书记古大存、赵紫阳、林李明，中共广州市委第二书记赵武成、副书记朱光、曾志及中共广东省委委员、市委委员、干部等一百多人。
