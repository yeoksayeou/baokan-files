In his speech, he emphasized that the Egyptian government has adopted a policy of economic cooperation with other countries in accordance with the recommendations of the Bandung Conference.

The Minister of Commerce and Industry said that the trade agreement signed with the People's Republic of China is a practical result of implementing the recommendations of the Bandung Conference. He emphatically explained the importance of this agreement to Egypt, and pointed out that the People's Republic of China is not only a huge sales market for Egyptian cotton, but also a source of goods necessary for Egypt. Nusair said that Egypt can buy many necessary goods from China, primarily iron, steel, tea, and tobacco.

Nusair is convinced that the establishment of government commercial offices in Egypt and the People's Republic of China will promote the further development of trade between the two countries.
