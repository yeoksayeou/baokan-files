Latin American People Are Fighting
    ——Visiting Youth Representatives from Latin American Countries
    By Our Correspondent
    On a sunny early autumn morning in Beijing, we visited some of the youth representatives from Latin American countries who came to China after attending the Warsaw World Youth Festival. Although the vast Pacific Ocean geographically separates our country from Latin America, the mutual care, sympathy, and sincere friendship between our peoples cannot be separated. This brief visit and conversation not only left the image of the Latin American people's fortitude in our memory but also presented us with a vivid picture of the life and struggle of the Latin American people.
    Latin America is a fertile and vast land with 160 million people. On this land, on the one hand, foreign imperialism and its local agents use all kinds of cruel means to maintain and expand their rule and plunder of this land and its people; on the other hand, people of all strata who are willing to see the independence and democratic development of their motherland are widely united, holding high the banner of national independence and democratic freedom. The struggle between these two forces runs through the entire development of Latin American countries' lives. Argentine representative Hugo Ramirez said: "In our country, there is the American 'Esso Oil Company,' which monopolizes our oil resources. Such a monopoly is very detrimental to our independence. The agreement signed between Argentina and this company is unequal. The Argentine people do not agree with this, so they are engaged in a firm struggle. The entire nation, including workers, farmers, and national capitalists, demands that the government take a path that conforms to national interests. Under the pressure of the people, the government has also taken some measures to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union and China, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of the United States. Therefore, it is trying its best to stage a 'Guatemala II' in Argentina in order to maintain the interests of American monopoly capital." From the background analyzed by Hugo Ramirez, people can clearly see the foreign imprint of the armed rebellion that occurred in Argentina not long ago and the recent new turmoil in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. The same situation also occurred in Brazil, another major country in Latin America. Brazilian representative Meyer Kaminetsky talked about the coup that took place last August under the instigation of the United States. He said that although the then-President Vargas was not a person who implemented an independent policy, under the demands of the people, he had to take some measures that conformed to national interests. For example, he once opposed the United States' complete control of Brazil's oil resources. But even such a weak expression of independence led to Vargas' forced resignation and suicide.
    Speaking of Guatemala, every person with a sense of justice will recall with anger the despicable acts of the United States in instigating and supporting armed bandits to subvert the democratic government of Guatemala last year. We listened attentively to Guatemalan representative Carlos Gontreras's account of the situation of the reign of terror after the reactionary government under the protection of the United States came to power. He said that all democratic organizations have been banned, and a large number of trade union and peasant movement activists have been arrested, imprisoned, and killed. All the members of the strike committee of the American "United Fruit Company" in the past were massacred; workers have lost the protection of trade unions and laws, and farmers have lost the land they obtained in the past land reform. Even teachers have lost the laws protecting teachers' rights. Within less than six months after the reactionary government came to power, 3,000 teachers were dismissed. The reactionary government has abolished the constitution of the past democratic government period, and now Guatemala has no constitution. On the contrary, the so-called "Anti-Communist Defense Committee" has now been established. This organization, which specializes in persecuting democratic forces, has more power than any court. It can arrest anyone. The people have no security at all. In short, the "Green Devil" has climbed onto the heads of the Guatemalan people again.
    Some representatives also mentioned the Colombian government's persecution of democratic forces: the reactionary government, supported by imperialism, used various weapons, including incendiary bombs, to suppress the people's resistance and peasant uprisings. Large-scale concentration camps were established in the country, and the Communist Party and other progressive organizations have been declared "illegal."
    However, the people will not be silent. Throughout Latin America, the people's struggle for national independence, against foreign interference, and in defense of peace is rising. Even in blood-stained Guatemala, the struggle has not stopped. Guatemalan representative Carlos Gontreras said excitedly: "On June 27 this year, the first anniversary of the American armed intervention in Guatemala, the people of the capital of Guatemala held a mass demonstration against American interference and government persecution. The marchers were in high spirits, shouting slogans such as 'Death to traitors!' and 'Death to tyranny!', marching all the way to the gate of the government building. Underground organizations are developing, and the people are continuing to fight." In Colombia, the nationwide struggle of peasants armed to defend their land is still going on. The Brazilian representative summarized the Brazilian people's struggle: "In the past two or three years, the people's struggle has been rising. The strike movement of workers to increase wages and improve their lives has expanded from one region to the entire province. In April 1953, 300,000 workers in Sao Paulo held a joint general strike. In September 1954, the working people of Sao Paulo held another vigorous general strike. Farmers and agricultural workers established the 'Brazilian Farmers and Agricultural Workers Union' to fight for land reform; staff, artists, doctors, and engineers also participated in the struggle for democratic rights." He continued to talk about the presidential election in Brazil on October 3 this year. He said that this is an important event. The Brazilian Communist Party called on the Brazilian people to oppose military coups, defend the constitution and democratic freedoms, and strive to bring about changes in Brazil that are conducive to democracy, peace, national independence, and progress through elections. At present, the Brazilian people are responding to the call of the Brazilian Communist Party and launching a vigorous struggle. Argentine representative Hugo Ramirez also said: "Independent democracy is the most fundamental issue for the Argentine people. The people's enthusiasm for fighting for independent democracy is very high. Because democracy is the foundation of all scientific and cultural development, this has prompted people with different views to unite against the oppression of foreign forces." After listening to the Latin American youth representatives talk about the struggles of their countries' people, it makes people more aware of what the Brazilian poet Jorge Amado said: "Our Latin American countries are fighting, even if the chains of slavery bind their hands, they can never make them surrender, they are invincible."
    The Latin American people fighting for national independence and democratic freedom regard the victory of the Chinese people's revolution as their own victory. The words of Guatemalan representative Carlos Gontreras are profound. He said: "The victory of the Chinese people is the most powerful support for the Guatemalan people's struggle." We heard from the Brazilian and Argentine representatives the voices of 160 million Latin American people supporting the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. Brazilian representative Meyer Kaminetsky enthusiastically said: "The Brazilian people know that Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. They believe that Taiwan should belong to China, and liberating Taiwan is the Chinese people's own business. They oppose American interference in China's internal affairs." Argentine representative Hugo Ramirez also said: "The Argentine people, especially the Argentine youth, fully understand the necessity of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan. We fully support the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan."
    In many countries in Latin America, the demand to establish diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries has gradually formed a broad mass movement. Brazilian representative Meyer Kaminetsky said: "The Brazilian people use signatures and demonstrations to express their desire to establish relations with the countries of the peace and democracy camp. Among them are workers, farmers, students, industrial and commercial people, and members of parliament. Currently, on the eve of the presidential election in Brazil, even some candidates of reactionary parties are using the establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union and China as campaign slogans." Finally, he emphasized: "Of course, to realize this wish, the Brazilian people still have to make greater efforts." Argentine representative Hugo Ramirez also talked about the same desire of the Argentine people. He said: "Many Argentine business people are fighting to develop international trade. Despite their different views, they are all striving to establish trade relations with the Soviet Union and China. Our 'Argentina-China Friendship Association' is specifically working to develop cultural relations with China. Many sports organizations in Argentina are also interested in establishing contact with the Chinese sports community."
    Although these youth representatives have only been in our country for a short time, "New China" has already given them a strong impression. Argentine representative Paul Anton said: "We have seen a tremendous change here." This change is also what the Brazilian representative said: "Old China is dead, and the future of New China is full of happiness." The Argentine representative talked about how impressed they were by the Chinese people's respect for and development of their own national cultural traditions. The Guatemalan representative said that he once again saw the Chinese people's desire for peace and friendship in the get-together with Beijing youth.
    As the reporter concluded the visit with each of them, they all asked to convey their friendship and respect to the Chinese people and youth on behalf of themselves and the people and youth of their countries.

    拉丁美洲人民在斗争
    ——访问拉丁美洲国家青年代表
    本报记者
    在北京的一个阳光灿烂的初秋的早晨，我们访问了在参加华沙世界青年联欢节后来我国访问的拉丁美洲国家的一些青年代表。虽然辽阔的太平洋把我们的国家和拉丁美洲从地理上分隔开来，但是我们人民之间的相互关怀、彼此同情和诚挚的友谊却是隔不开的。这次短暂的访问和谈话，不仅在我们的记忆里留下了拉丁美洲人民的刚毅的形象，而且在我们面前展现了一幅拉丁美洲人民生活和斗争的生动的图景。
    拉丁美洲是一块有着一亿六千万人民的丰饶而广大的土地。在这块土地上，一方面，外国帝国主义及其在本地的代理人用尽种种残酷的手段来维持并扩大它们对这块土地及其人民的统治和掠夺；另一方面，一切愿意看到祖国独立和民主发展的各阶层人民，正广泛地团结起来，高举起民族独立和民主自由的旗帜。这两种力量之间的斗争，贯串在拉丁美洲国家生活的全部发展中。阿根廷代表雨果·拉米莱说：“在我们国家里有着美国的‘美孚油公司’，它垄断着我们的石油资源，这样的垄断对我们的独立非常不利。阿根廷和这个公司签订的协定是不平等的。阿根廷人民不同意这样做，因此正在进行坚强的斗争。全国人民，包括工人、农民和民族资本家，要求政府走符合民族利益的路。政府在人民的压力下也采取了一些同苏联、中国发展贸易关系的措施，这引起了美国的不满，因此它竭力想在阿根廷搞一个‘危地马拉第二’，以便维护美国垄断资本的利益。”从雨果·拉米莱分析的这个背景，人们可以清楚地看到阿根廷不久前发生的武装叛乱和最近阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯的新的骚动的外国烙印。同样的情形也发生在拉丁美洲的另一大国巴西。巴西代表梅伊尔·卡米尼茨基谈到去年八月在美国策动下发生的政变。他说，虽然当时的总统瓦加斯并不是一个执行独立政策的人，但是他在人民的要求下，不得不采取一些符合民族利益的措施，例如他曾反对美国全部控制巴西的石油资源。但是就是这样一种微弱的独立的表现，就导致了瓦加斯的被迫辞职和自杀。
    提起危地马拉，每一个有正义感的人都会怀着愤怒的心情追忆起去年美国策动和支持武装匪徒颠覆危地马拉民主政府的卑劣行径。我们注意地倾听危地马拉代表卡洛斯·龚德莱拉斯叙述了在美国庇护下的反动政府上台后的恐怖统治的情形。他说，民主组织已全部被取缔，大批的工会、农民运动的活动分子被逮捕、监禁和杀害，美国“联合果品公司”过去的罢工委员会的委员全被残杀；工人失去了工会组织和法律的保护，农民失去了过去土地改革中所得到的土地。连教师也失去了保护教师权利的法律，在反动政府上台后不到六个月的时间内，就有三千名教师被开除。反动政府取消了过去民主政府时期的宪法，现在危地马拉已经没有宪法了。相反地，现在成立了所谓“反对共产主义保卫委员会”，这个专事迫害民主力量的组织，它的权力比任何法庭都要大，它可以逮捕任何人。人民毫无安全可言。总之，“绿色魔鬼”又爬上了危地马拉人民的头上。
    有些代表也顺便讲到了哥伦比亚政府迫害民主力量的情况：得到帝国主义支持的反动政府用各种武器，包括燃烧弹来镇压人民的反抗和农民起义，国内建立起大规模的集中营，共产党和其他进步组织已被宣布为“非法”。
    但是，人民是不会沉默的。在整个拉丁美洲，人民争取民族独立、反对外国干涉、保卫和平的斗争日益高涨起来。就在血迹斑斑的危地马拉，斗争也没有停息过。危地马拉代表卡洛斯·龚德莱拉斯激动地说：“在今年六月二十七日美国武装干涉危地马拉一周年的时候，危地马拉首都人民举行了反对美国干涉和反对政府迫害的群众示威，游行者情绪高涨，高呼‘卖国者死亡！’、‘专制死亡！’的口号，一直冲到政府大厦门口。地下组织在发展中，人民在继续斗争中。”在哥伦比亚，农民武装起来保卫自己土地的全国性斗争至今还在进行。巴西代表综述了巴西人民的斗争情况：“最近二、三年来人民斗争日趋高涨。工人为提高工资、改善生活的罢工运动由一个地区扩大到整个省。一九五三年四月圣保罗三十万工人举行了联合大罢工。一九五四年九月圣保罗劳动人民又举行了轰轰烈烈的总罢工。农民和农业工人建立了‘巴西农民和农业工人联盟’，为争取实行土地改革而斗争；职员、文艺工作者、医生、工程师也都参加了争取民主权利的斗争。”他继续谈到今年十月三日巴西的总统选举。他说，这是一个重要的事件。巴西共产党号召巴西人民反对军事政变，保卫宪法和民主自由，争取通过选举使巴西发生有利于民主、和平、民族独立和进步的变化。目前，巴西人民正在响应巴西共产党的号召展开积极的斗争。阿根廷代表雨果·拉米莱也说：“独立民主是阿根廷人民最基本的问题。人民为独立民主而斗争的热情很高。因为民主是一切科学文化发展的基础，这就促使观点不同的人共同起来反对外国势力的压迫。”听了拉丁美洲国家青年代表谈了他们国家人民斗争的情况之后，使人更加了解巴西诗人乔治·亚马多说过的话：“我们拉丁美洲的国家是在战斗着，即使奴役的锁链束缚着他们的手，也决不能使他们屈服，他们是不可战胜的”。
    为民族独立和民主自由而斗争的拉丁美洲人民，把中国人民革命的胜利看成是自己的胜利。危地马拉代表卡洛斯·龚德莱拉斯的话是深刻的，他说：“中国人民的胜利就是对危地马拉人民斗争的最有力的支持。”我们从巴西和阿根廷代表的谈话中听到了一亿六千万拉丁美洲人民支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争的声音。巴西代表梅伊尔·卡米尼茨基热情地说：“巴西人民知道台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，他们认为台湾应该属于中国，解放台湾是中国人民自己的事情，他们反对美国干涉中国内政。”阿根廷代表雨果·拉米莱也说：“阿根廷人民，尤其是阿根廷青年十分了解中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的必要性，我们完全支持中国人民解放台湾。”
    在拉丁美洲许多国家中，要求同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家建立外交和贸易关系已经逐渐形成一个广泛的群众性运动。巴西代表梅伊尔·卡米尼茨基说：“巴西人民用签名和游行示威来表示他们同和平民主阵营各国建立关系的愿望，他们中间有工人、农民、学生、工商业界人士、议员。目前，在巴西举行总统选举的前夕，甚至一些反动政党的候选人也把同苏联和中国建立外交和贸易关系这件事作为竞选的口号。”最后，他强调说：“当然，要实现这种愿望，巴西人民还要进行更大的努力。”阿根廷代表雨果·拉米莱也谈到了阿根廷人民同样的愿望，他说：“许多阿根廷工商界人士正在为发展国际贸易进行斗争。尽管他们的见解不同，但是他们都在争取同苏联、中国建立贸易关系。我们的‘阿中友好协会’专门努力发展同中国的文化关系。阿根廷的许多体育团体也对建立同中国体育界的联系感到兴趣。”
    虽然这些青年代表们刚到我们国家不久，可是
  “新中国”已经给了他们强烈的印象。阿根廷代表保尔·安东说：“我们在这里看到了一个巨大的变革。”这种变革也就是巴西代表所说的：“旧中国死亡了，新中国的未来充满幸福。”阿根廷代表谈到他们对中国人民尊重和发展自己民族文化传统的印象十分深刻。危地马拉代表说，他在同北京青年的联欢中再一次看到了中国人民争取和平和友谊的愿望。
    在记者结束对他们每一人的访问时，他们都要求转达他们和他们国家的人民和青年对中国人民和青年的友谊和敬意。
