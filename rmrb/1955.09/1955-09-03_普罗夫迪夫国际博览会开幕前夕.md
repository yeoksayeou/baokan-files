Plovdiv is a city with a population of 180,000. It is located on the Thracian Plain, surrounded by mountains, with the silver ribbon of the Maritsa River running through it. The residents of Plovdiv are proud of creating such new enterprises as the Kolarov Automobile Repair Factory, the Maritsa Textile Factory, the Peter Chengilov Shoe Factory, modern schools, children's palaces, and clinics, the September 9th Stadium with a capacity of 35,000 spectators, the National Theatre, the 3,000-seat open-air theatre at the foot of Stalin Hill, the majestic residential buildings along Dimitrov Avenue, the flat streets and squares in the shade of green trees, and the newly opened gardens and parks, etc.

Plovdiv is the venue for the 16th International Fair, which will be held from September 6th to 20th. The first such gathering was as far back as 1892. At that time, Plovdiv had already become an important trading center in Southeastern Europe. Under bourgeois rule, the gatherings were held in schools or temporary locations around the city. After liberation, the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria realized the great economic, political, and cultural significance of the Plovdiv Fair and specially opened up a place on the left bank of the Maritsa River eight years ago to establish a permanent site for the fair.

The scale of this year's Plovdiv Fair is very large. In 1952, the total area of the exhibition was only over 180,000 square meters, while this year's total area will reach 380,000 square meters. Currently, the exhibition area for exhibits covers 100,500 square meters, while in 1952 it was only 60,000 square meters.

The achievements of Bulgaria in developing heavy industry, food industry, light industry, agriculture, timber industry, construction industry, and handicraft industry will be exhibited in fourteen exhibition halls covering an area of 64,000 square meters. Many countries will participate in the Plovdiv International Fair. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic have all expanded their exhibition areas. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam will also participate in the exhibition for the first time this year.

Many companies and enterprises in capitalist countries have also expressed great interest in the fair. Many enterprises and companies in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Sweden, West Germany, Israel, Norway, and Switzerland have expressed their willingness to participate in the fair. In order to facilitate foreign participation in the exhibition, the Bulgarian government has specially allocated a sum of funds, more than 200 US dollars per square meter for indoor exhibition areas and more than 100 US dollars per square meter for outdoor exhibition areas.

In order to hold the 16th International Fair, intense preparations have been carried out. Now, the thirty-eight halls where various industrial products and agricultural products will be sold have been completed. The seven halls specially used for exhibiting livestock have also been prepared. Railway lines directly connecting to each hall have also been laid. Trains fully loaded with goods will unload various goods directly on the platforms in front of each hall.

The newly built majestic Soviet Exhibition Hall has been erected along the bank of the Maritsa River. It covers a total area of 6,000 square meters. The ground for installing heavy machinery is paved with concrete, the walls have been plastered, and the stairs are paved with artificial marble. A cinema has also been completed here.

The Vasil Levski Exhibition Hall will be the exhibition site for capitalist countries. This hall covers a total area of 4,000 square meters. The architectural structure is a unique cylindrical form. The interior of this hall is paved with various marble materials that can be found in Bulgaria.

This year, the fair has made complete arrangements for the daily life of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come here. Venetian-style fountains, walkways planted with flowers and trees, and green areas, hundreds of verdant trees, an artificial lake with an area of more than twenty acres, and a newly built summer restaurant that can accommodate two thousand guests will make people who come here feel more pleasant.

The fair is about to open. The fresh, refreshing, and radiant city of Plovdiv is preparing to welcome thousands upon thousands of guests from all over the country and abroad. The Municipal People's Representatives Conference is carrying out preparatory work according to a specific plan. An ancient Bulgarian-style restaurant has been newly built on the bank of the artificial lake in the central city garden. A modern sports field has also been built at the foot of Stalin Hill. Almost everywhere in the city there are green areas, flower walls, and gardens with fountains.

Various receptions and sports competitions with foreign artists and athletes will be held here. In addition, there will be instrumental performances, chorus, and opera performances.

Preparing food and accommodation for thousands upon thousands of visitors has become the primary task of the Plovdiv Municipal People's Conference. The city's two best-equipped dedicated hotels and several restaurants have been designated for use by foreign guests.

The weather in Plovdiv in September is warm and refreshing. Streets and squares, hills and parks will be crowded with tourists. During these days, Plovdiv will bring together hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country and abroad.

    普罗夫迪夫国际博览会开幕前夕
    保加利亚  米托迪·塔湼夫
    普罗夫迪夫是一个拥有十八万人口的城市。它位于色雷斯平原上，四周群山环抱，一条银带般的马里察河横贯其中。普罗夫迪夫的居民们因为创建了这样一些新的事业而感到自豪：科拉罗夫汽车修理厂，马里察纺织厂，彼得·千吉洛夫制鞋厂，现代化的学校、少年宫和诊疗所，可容纳三万五千个观众的九月九日运动场，国家剧院，斯大林山麓的设有三千个座位的露天剧场，沿着季米特洛夫大街两旁的雄伟的住宅建筑，绿荫中的平坦街道和广场，以及新开辟的花园和公园等等。
    普罗夫迪夫是即将从九月六日到二十日举行的第十六届国际博览会的会址。第一次这样的集会远在一八九二年。当时普罗夫迪夫就已成为东南欧的一个重要的贸易中心。在资产阶级统治下，当时的集会是在学校里或城里各处的临时场所举行的。解放后，保加利亚人民共和国政府意识到普罗夫迪夫博览会的巨大的经济、政治和文化意义，八年以前特地在马里察河左岸为博览会开辟了一块地方，建立了永久性的会址。
    今年普罗夫迪夫博览会的规模是很大的。一九五二年展览会的面积总共只有十八万多平方公尺，今年的总面积将达三十八万平方公尺。现在展品的展出面积共占地达十万零五千平方公尺，而在一九五二年时只有六万平方公尺。
    保加利亚发展重工业、食品工业和轻工业、农业、木材业、建筑业和手工艺品工业等方面的成就，将在占地六万四千平方公尺的十四个展览馆里展出。很多国家将参加普罗夫迪夫国际博览会。苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国都已扩大了展出面积。越南民主共和国今年也将首次参加展出。
    资本主义国家也有许多公司和企业对博览会表示了很大的兴趣。奥地利、比利时、意大利、法国、英国、瑞典、西德、以色列、挪威和瑞士等国家的许多企业公司，已经表示愿意参加博览会。保加利亚政府为了便利外国参加展览会，特别拨出了一笔经费，室内展览部分每平方公尺二百多美元，露天展览区每平方公尺一百多美元。
    为了举行第十六届国际博览会，曾经进行了紧张的准备工作。现在，将在这里出售各种工业品和农产品的三十八个大厅，已经建筑完成。特别为展览牲畜用的七个大厅，也已准备好。直通各个大厅的铁路线也已铺成。满装货物的列车，将直接在每座大厅前的月台上卸下各种货物。
    新建的雄伟的苏联展览馆，已经沿着马里察河岸矗立起来。它共计占地六千平方公尺。安置重型机器的地面，铺设了混凝土，墙壁已经粉刷，楼梯铺设了人造大理石。这里的一座电影院也已落成。
    瓦西尔·莱夫斯基展览馆将是资本主义国家的展出地点。这座大厅总共占地四千平方公尺。建筑结构是别出心裁的圆柱形式的。这座大厅的内部铺设着保加利亚国内可以找到的各种各样的大理石料。
    今年，博览会为前来这里参观的十几万观众作了完备的生活上的安排。威尼斯式的喷泉，两旁栽种花木的走道和绿荫地带，数百棵青翠树木，一个面积达二十多亩的人工湖和一所新建的可容纳两千个客人的夏季餐厅，将使到这里来光顾的人们更加感到愉快。
    博览会就要开幕了。清新、爽朗和容光焕发的普罗夫迪夫市，正在准备迎接从全国各地和国外来此参观的成千成万的客人。市劳动人民代表会议正按照特定计划进行着筹备工作。城市中心花园里的人工湖畔，已经新建成了一座古老的保加利亚式的餐厅。在斯大林山的山麓下，也已建成了一个现代化的运动场。全城几乎到处都有绿荫地区、花墙和带有喷泉的花园。
    这里将举行各种各样的招待会和有外国艺术家和运动家参加的体育竞赛会。此外还将要有器乐演奏、合唱和歌剧等的演出。
    为成千成万个来此参观的客人准备食宿，已成为普罗夫迪夫市人民会议的首要任务。城市里设备最好的两个专用旅馆和几所餐厅，已被指定拨供外国来宾使用。
    普罗夫迪夫九月里的天气是温暖而爽朗的。街道和广场，山岗和公园里将会挤满游客。在这些日子里，普罗夫迪夫将从全国各地和国外，把十几万人们汇集在一起。
