    The tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly has opened. This session is being held after the Geneva Four-Power Summit, as the international situation begins to generally ease, and the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation among nations is strengthening and expanding. This is the first time in ten years that such a favorable situation for the cause of the United Nations has emerged.
    The lofty responsibility entrusted to the United Nations organization by the UN Charter is to maintain international peace and security and to develop friendly cooperation among nations. The significant developments in the international situation over the past year, especially the achievements of the Geneva Conference, have created favorable conditions for the United Nations to fulfill its mission in accordance with the Charter. Now, many pressing international issues need to be resolved in accordance with the "Geneva spirit," and the United Nations General Assembly bears an important responsibility in this regard. Peace-loving people of all countries hope that the UN General Assembly will act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, so as to consolidate the "Geneva spirit" and promote the resolution of some important international issues. The tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly should become a new starting point for strengthening the role of the United Nations and rebuilding its prestige.
    The people of the world are eager to consolidate peace. The main key to consolidating peace is, first and foremost, universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This is the most important issue facing the United Nations General Assembly.
    Over the past year, many countries have made efforts in this regard, especially the efforts of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, which have opened up realistic avenues for reaching an agreement on this issue. The new proposal put forward by the Soviet government on May 10 this year is a major contribution to solving this problem. In order to promote disarmament through practical actions and strengthen international trust, the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have also successively announced reductions in the size of their own armed forces. This has set a brilliant example for other countries, especially the major Western countries, to implement disarmament. The peace policy pursued by our country, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democracies is completely consistent. Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of our country, announced on July 16 this year that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country has demobilized more than 4,510,000 people from the army. This shows that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies are not only promoting the realization of universal disarmament in words, but also with concrete actions. This open and aboveboard attitude and action of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies are in line with the principles of the UN Charter and the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world, and have therefore won the support and endorsement of widespread public opinion in various countries.
    However, the realization of universal disarmament cannot be promoted solely by unilateral actions. The Western countries, such as the United States, Britain, and France, also agreed at the Geneva Four-Power Conference to "draw up an acceptable disarmament system through the Disarmament Subcommittee of the United Nations," and at the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting, Britain, France, Canada, and the Soviet Union shared a consistent attitude on the key elements of the plans for reducing armaments and armed forces and prohibiting atomic weapons. However, it is obvious to all that they have not taken corresponding positive actions in this regard. The United States has not only failed to express any clear opinion on the Soviet Union's proposal of May 10 to this day, but also "reserved" its views on all the previous proposals put forward at the Subcommittee meeting. Roberts, the diplomatic commentator for "The Washington Post," pointed out in a commentary published on September 13 that Stassen's "reservations" confirmed that "Washington is not considering the issue of disarmament." At the same time, on the other hand, the United States Secretary of the Air Force openly stated that the United States opposes disarmament. He said that the United States does not rely on disarmament for its security, but on its retaliatory capabilities, on maintaining a so-called overwhelmingly superior air force atomic power. This is actually advocating and promoting an arms race. These practices and statements by the United States run counter to the wishes of the people of the world and are completely at odds with the trend of easing the international situation over the past year.
    The realization of universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons is the universal demand of the people of the world, and no matter how a few people obstruct it, it must be realized. This will not only help consolidate lasting world peace, but will also reduce the heavy military burden of various countries, which will be conducive to their economic development. The United Nations General Assembly has a responsibility to reach an agreement on this major issue in order to strengthen international trust and establish peaceful cooperation between countries.
    At present, another important development in the international situation is the general upsurge of the movement of the people of Asian and African countries and people in other parts of the world against colonialism and demanding freedom and independence. The people of Morocco and Algeria in North Africa continue to wage a heroic struggle for national independence. The people of India and Indonesia demand the elimination of colonial rule in their territories and the recovery of Goa and West Irian. The struggle of the people of Cyprus to break free from British colonial enslavement is also continuing. The struggles of all countries to win and safeguard national independence and to ensure national sovereignty and territorial integrity are in line with the principles of the UN Charter. The Asian-African Conference once emphasized its opposition to colonialism in all its manifestations and supported the independence aspirations of colonial peoples. However, the colonial countries disregarded the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. They not only refused to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the people of various countries, but also resorted to violence to suppress the struggle of the people of various countries for freedom and independence. This policy of colonialism and the violent actions taken by the colonial countries violate the UN Charter, have caused a deterioration of the situation in many places, and endanger international peace and security. Obviously, this situation cannot be allowed to continue. The United Nations General Assembly should take appropriate measures in accordance with the spirit of the UN Charter to satisfy the aspirations of the colonial people for freedom and independence and to stop the barbaric actions of the colonialists.
    Whether the United Nations organization can fully play its role largely depends on whether it is a truly universal organization. As everyone knows, due to the unreasonable stance of the United States and some other countries, many countries are still excluded from the United Nations organization. The only reason why the United States wants to do this is because it dislikes the political and social systems of the People's Democracies. Precisely because of this, the current United Nations is not worthy of its name as a world international organization. Many of its actions are also highly one-sided, and therefore it cannot properly play its due role. This situation has reached a point where it must be changed. More and more people now advocate that the membership of the United Nations must be universal; the United Nations organization itself should embody the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different political and social systems, in order to expand and strengthen its role and influence.
    The People's Republic of China, which has a quarter of the world's population, has not yet restored its legitimate rights in the United Nations. This is an important reason why the United Nations cannot play its role in the great cause of maintaining international peace, and it is also a stain on the history of the United Nations. The great People's Republic of China, from the day it was founded, has unswervingly pursued a policy of maintaining peace and international friendship, and its international prestige and indispensable role in international affairs are growing day by day. This fact has been recognized by many countries and more and more insightful people around the world. However, the forces in the United States that are unwilling to achieve international reconciliation and oppose the easing of the situation still adhere to their unrealistic policies and attempt to once again obstruct the United Nations from restoring our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations. The United States representative to the United Nations, Lodge, openly stated that the United States would "continue to oppose" the People's Republic of China's "entry into the United Nations." The attitude of the United States is a challenge to the world's just humanity and a stubborn obstruction and sabotage of the cause of the United Nations. This is firmly opposed by people around the world who uphold the principles of the UN Charter. The United Nations General Assembly should immediately expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and restore the legitimate status and rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    In summary, everyone can see that the situation facing the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly is: on the one hand, there are objective conditions that are conducive to the cause of the United Nations, and on the other hand, there is also a countercurrent that seeks to maintain tensions and obstruct the implementation of the UN Charter. The people have great expectations for the United Nations. In order to strengthen the role and prestige of the United Nations, the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly must fully recognize its own responsibilities and make major efforts at a new starting point in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, so that the General Assembly can make its due contribution to the continued easing of the international situation and the consolidation of peace.

### 十届联大应促进国际局势的继续缓和

    十届联大应促进国际局势的继续缓和
    联合国第十届大会开幕了。这届大会是在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议之后，国际局势开始普遍缓和，国际间的互信合作的精神正在加强和扩大的情况之下举行的。这是十年来第一次出现的对联合国的事业十分有利的形势。
    联合国宪章所赋予联合国组织的崇高职责，是维持国际和平及安全、发展国际间的友好合作。一年来国际形势的重大发展，特别是日内瓦会议的成就，为联合国按照宪章执行它的任务，创造了良好的条件。现在，许多迫切的国际问题有待按照“日内瓦精神”来谋求解决，在这方面联合国大会负有重要的责任。各国爱好和平人民都希望联合国大会按照联合国宪章的宗旨和原则行事，以便巩固“日内瓦精神”，并促进一些重要的国际问题的解决。联合国第十届大会应当成为加强联合国的作用和重建它的威信的一个新的起点。
    全世界人民切望巩固和平。巩固和平的主要关键首先就是普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器。这就是摆在联合国大会面前的一个最重要的问题。
    一年来，不少国家在这方面作了努力，特别是苏联和人民民主国家的努力，已为在这个问题上达成协议开辟了现实的途径。苏联政府今年五月十日提出的新建议是对解决这个问题的重大贡献。为了从实际行动上来促进裁军，加强国际信任，苏联和各人民民主国家还先后宣布了裁减自己国家的武装部队人数。这就为其他国家，首先是西方主要国家实行裁军作出了辉煌的典范。我国和苏联以及人民民主国家所奉行的和平政策是完全一致的。我国国防部长彭德怀今年七月十六日宣布，自从中华人民共和国成立以来，我国已经从军队中复员了四百五十一万多人。这说明，苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家不仅在言词上，而且以具体的行动来促成普遍裁减军备的实现。苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家这种光明磊落的态度和行动，符合于联合国宪章的原则，符合于全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，因而获得了各国广泛公众舆论的支持和拥护。
    但是，普遍裁军的实现不能单靠一方面的行动来促成。美、英、法等西方国家，在日内瓦四国会议上也曾同意“通过联合国裁军委员会小组委员会拟订一个可以接受的裁军制度”，并且在裁军小组会上，英国、法国、加拿大和苏联对裁减军备和武装部队及禁止原子武器的计划中的各重要项目的态度是一致的。然而人所共见，它们在这方面并没有采取相应的积极的行动。美国不但至今没有对苏联五月十日的建议表示任何明确的意见，而且还对小组委员会上以前所提出的一切建议“保留”自己的看法。“华盛顿邮报”外交评论员罗伯茨在九月十三日发表的评论中指出：史塔生的“保留”使人们确认“华盛顿不考虑裁减军备的问题”。同时，另一方面，美国空军部长还公然表示美国反对裁军。他说：美国不是把它的安全寄托在裁军方面，而是寄托在报复能力方面，寄托在保持所谓有压倒优势的空军原子力量方面。这实际上就是主张和宣扬军备竞赛。美国的这些做法和表示，同世界人民的愿望是相反的，同一年来缓和国际局势的潮流是完全抵触的。
    实现普遍裁军和禁止原子武器，是世界人民的普遍要求，不管少数人怎样阻挠，它必须得到实现。这不但将有助于巩固世界的持久和平，并且也将减轻各国沉重的军费负担，有利于它们的经济发展。联合国大会有责任就这项重大问题达成协议，以加强国际信任，确立各国之间的和平合作。
    目前，在国际局势中的另一个重要的发展，是亚非各国人民和世界其他各处人民反对殖民主义、要求自由独立运动的普遍高涨。北非的摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族独立继续进行着英勇的斗争。印度人民和印度尼西亚人民要求消除在他们国土上的殖民统治，收回果阿和西伊里安。塞浦路斯人民为摆脱英国殖民奴役的斗争也在继续展开。各国人民为争取和维护民族独立、保障国家主权和领土完整而进行的斗争，都是符合于联合国宪章的原则的。亚非会议曾经着重声明反对一切表现中的殖民主义，支持殖民地人民的独立愿望。但是殖民国家却不顾联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。它们不但不肯满足各国人民的合法愿望，反而采取了暴力手段来镇压各国人民要求自由独立的斗争。殖民国家的这种坚持殖民主义的政策和它们所采取的暴力行动，违反了联合国宪章，在许多地方造成了局势的恶化，危害着国际和平和安全。显然，这种局势是不能容许再继续下去的。联合国大会应当按照联合国宪章的精神采取适当措施，来满足殖民地人民要求自由独立的愿望，并制止殖民主义者的野蛮行动。
    联合国组织是否能够充分发挥它的作用，在很大的程度上决定于它是否是一个真正的普遍性组织。大家知道，由于美国及其他一些国家的不合理的立场，至今仍有许多国家被排斥在联合国组织之外。美国之所以要这样做，只是因为人民民主国家的政治和社会制度是它们所不喜欢的。正是因为这样，所以目前联合国作为一个世界国际组织是名实不符的。它的许多行动也带有极大的片面性，从而不能适当地起它应有的作用。这种情况已到了必须改变的时候了。现在愈来愈多的人主张联合国的会员国必须具有普遍性；联合国组织本身应该体现出不同的政治和社会制度的国家和平共处的原则，以扩大和加强它的作用和影响。
    拥有全世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国至今还没有恢复它在联合国的合法权利。这是联合国不能在维护国际和平的伟大事业中发挥它的作用的重要原因，同时这也是联合国历史上的污点。伟大的中华人民共和国从它成立的那一天起，就坚持不渝地奉行着维护和平和国际友好的政策，它的国际威望和在国际事务中不可缺少的作用正在日益增长。这种事实已为全世界许多国家和更多的有识之士所公认。可是，美国那种不愿取得国际和解，反对和缓局势的势力却至今还是坚持他们的不现实的政策、力图再一次阻挠联合国恢复我国在联合国的合法权利。美国驻联合国代表洛奇公然声称美国将“继续反对”中华人民共和国“进入联合国”。美国的这种态度是对世界正义人类的挑战，是对联合国事业的顽强阻挠和破坏。这是世界维护联合国宪章的原则的人们所坚决反对的。联合国大会应该立即驱逐蒋介石卖国集团的代表，并恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位和权利。
    综上所述，人人可以看到，联合国第十届大会所面临的局势是：一方面存在有利于联合国事业的客观条件，另一方面也存在着力图保持紧张局势，阻挠联合国宪章的实施的逆流。人民对于联合国的期待是很大的。为了加强联合国的作用和威信，联合国第十届大会必须充分认识它自己的责任，按照联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，在新的起点上作出重大的努力，以便大会能够为继续缓和国际局势、巩固和平作出它应有的贡献。
