    A Female Youth Train Crew
    On the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway train, there is a female youth train crew that is particularly praised by passengers. This female youth train crew was established on March 8, 1953, with a total of eighteen members, all girls aged eighteen to twenty-two.
    In order to ensure that passengers arrive at their destination safely and comfortably, in addition to cleaning the carriages spotlessly and preventing accidents, they also tirelessly explain current events and travel knowledge to passengers, and provide them with good care and attention in their lives. In the past two years, due to their extraordinary contributions to the people in their work, they have been universally praised by passengers, receiving more than 1,400 pieces of commendations and letters of praise. The entire crew was named an outstanding team of the Chongqing Railway Administration in 1954. Photo by Li Xuan (Contribution from Sichuan Daily)
    Before the train departs, the conductor and chief attendant always contact the passenger transport supervisor to understand the number of passengers and other information.
    The attendants treat the train like their own home, always keeping it clean.
    Every two months, the attendants go to the Chongqing Municipal People's Library to select and borrow some new books for passengers to read on the train.
    After each train reaches its destination, the conductor Chen Xianfu always speaks to the attendants, summarizing the experience in the train work.

    一个女青年列车班
    在成渝铁路的列车上，有一个受到旅客们特别称赞的女青年列车班。这个女青年列车班是在一九五三年三月八日建立的，全班共十八人，都是十八岁至二十二岁的姑娘。
    为了使旅客们能安全舒适地到达目的地，她们除了把车厢打扫得干干净净和防止发生事故外，还不倦地向旅客们讲解时事和乘车常识，在生活上给旅客们以很好的关怀和照顾。两年来，由于她们在工作中为人民作出了不平凡的贡献，受到了旅客普遍的称赞，共收到一千四百多件表扬意见和表扬信。全班在一九五四年被评为重庆铁路管理局优秀小组。　李煊摄（四川日报社稿）
    在列车出发前，车长和主任列车员每次都同客运值班员取得联系，了解旅客人数等情况。
    列车员把列车当成自己的家一样，经常打扫得干干净净。
    列车员每两月要到重庆市人民图书馆去选借一些新书，供旅客们在车上阅读。
    每次列车到达终点后，车长陈显富都要给列车员讲话，总结列车工作中的经验。
