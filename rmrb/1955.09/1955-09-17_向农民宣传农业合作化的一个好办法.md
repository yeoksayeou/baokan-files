A Good Way to Promote Agricultural Cooperativization to Farmers
    Zhong Huai

    Currently, various localities are actively preparing for a major development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. An important part of the preparatory work is to systematically and repeatedly publicize our Party's principles, policies, and methods regarding agricultural cooperativization to the masses of peasants. This publicity can and should be carried out in a variety of ways and by utilizing all aspects of the publicity forces. In some areas of Yunnan, the Party organizations have mobilized veteran cooperative members to publicize the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the specific policies of agricultural cooperativization to the masses outside the cooperatives. This is a relatively good practice.

    At the end of July this year, Kaiyuan County, Yunnan, began the work of developing 140 agricultural producers' cooperatives before the autumn harvest. In order to promote the establishment of cooperatives, the Kaiyuan County Party Committee selected 36 members from several old cooperatives with a better foundation, who had a deep understanding of the principles and policies of agricultural cooperativization, to form mutual aid and cooperation reporting groups and conduct publicity in the areas where cooperatives were to be established. They adopted methods such as general meetings, small group discussions, mobile propaganda, individual visits, and answering questions to publicize the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives and explain the principles and policies of agricultural cooperativization to the masses in the areas where cooperatives were to be established. Precisely because they used personal experiences and concrete examples for their publicity, they were warmly welcomed by the peasant masses, which dispelled the concerns of those who had ideological misgivings. For example, the peasants in the Seventh District reflected: "The old cooperative members have experienced it themselves, so we have no doubts about what they say." After listening to the report, 120 peasant households in Taipingzhai Township, Fifth District, applied to join the cooperative, and some peasants wrote in their application forms: "After listening to the report of the old cooperative members, the ideological knots have been untied."

    Some Party organizations have also organized old cooperative members to publicize the methods of establishing cooperatives to the staff and masses preparing to establish cooperatives, helping them to accept the experiences and lessons of the old cooperatives in establishing cooperatives and avoid detours. The Hei Yi Township Party Branch in the Fifth District of Chuxiong County had organized some staff members of old cooperatives to conduct such publicity. When a cooperative establishment group of a prospective agricultural producers’ cooperative in this township was examining the qualifications of members who applied to join the cooperative, at first they were not discerning and only looked at the surface and not at the essence. For example, some people only saw that a person who had once been a Kuomintang military police officer was now “well-behaved in production,” so they thought he could join the cooperative. At this time, a staff member of an old cooperative used the fact that an old cooperative had absorbed a rich peasant when it was established, and how this rich peasant later carried out exploitation and sabotage activities within the cooperative, to sound the alarm to everyone, so that everyone further realized the importance of ensuring the purity of the agricultural producers' cooperative, and earnestly adhered to the conditions for members. When the work of establishing this cooperative entered the stage of land appraisal and production assessment, some people wanted to suppress the yield very low, while others wanted to assess it high. The old cooperative sent staff members to the mass meeting to explain with the example of the old cooperative's yield assessment last year, clarifying that assessing the yield low would harm the production enthusiasm of those with more and better land, while assessing the yield high would disadvantage those with less land and more labor, and that the result would affect the consolidation of the agricultural producers' cooperative. This educated everyone to further recognize the semi-socialist nature of the current agricultural producers' cooperative, thereby correctly carrying out the appraisal work. Obviously, publicizing the methods of establishing cooperatives to the peasant masses preparing to establish cooperatives is actually publicizing the Party's principles and policies on agricultural cooperativization to them, and it is a more concrete kind of publicity.

    From the above examples, it can be seen that organizing old cooperative members to publicize the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the Party's principles, policies, and methods on agricultural cooperativization to the masses outside the cooperatives can achieve good results in attracting the masses outside the cooperatives to actively embark on the road of cooperativization. Moreover, this practice is also an education for the old cooperative members themselves—educating them to improve their sense of responsibility to the masses outside the cooperatives, and educating them to deepen their understanding of the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the Party's principles and policies. This method of mass self-education and the working method of the mass line of using the advanced parts of the masses to drive the backward parts are worth promoting. Of course, when we organize old cooperative members to publicize to the masses outside the cooperatives, we should not only ask them to publicize the benefits of cooperativization, but also ask them to point out the difficulties that may be encountered in the process of cooperativization. In this way, we will not only be able to inspire the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to establish cooperatives, but also enable them to be fully mentally prepared to overcome any difficulties in establishing cooperatives.

    向农民宣传农业合作化的一个好办法
    钟怀
    目前各地都在积极进行农业生产合作社大发展的准备工作。准备工作中的重要一项，就是要在农民群众中有系统地和反复地宣传我们党关于农业合作化的方针政策和办法。进行这种宣传，可以而且应当采取多种多样的方式和运用各方面的宣传力量。云南有些地区的党组织动员老社社员向社外群众宣传农业生产合作社的优越性和农业合作化的具体政策，就是一种比较好的做法。
    今年七月底，云南开远县开始了秋前发展一百四十个农业生产合作社的工作。为了推动建社工作，开远县委曾在基础较好的几个老社中，抽调了对农业合作化方针政策体会比较深刻的三十六个社员，组成互助合作报告团，到建社地区进行宣传。他们采取了大会报告、小会座谈、流动宣传、个别访问、解答问题等方式，向建社地区的群众宣传了农业生产合作社的优越性，讲解了农业合作化的方针政策。正是因为他们是用亲身经历和具体事例来进行宣传，所以受到了农民群众的热烈欢迎，使得那些有思想顾虑的人们打消了顾虑。像七区农民就反映：老社社员是亲身经历过的，他们说的我们就没有怀疑了。五区太平寨乡群众听过报告后，有一百二十户农民申请入社，有些农民在申请书上这样写道：听老社社员报告后，解开了思想疙瘩。
    有的地区的党组织还组织老社社员向筹备建社的工作人员和群众进行了建社办法的宣传，帮助他们在建社中接受老社的经验教训，少走和不走弯路。楚雄县第五区黑邑乡党支部就曾组织过一些老社的工作人员进行过这种宣传。这个乡一个筹建中的农业生产合作社办社小组在审查入社社员的条件时，起初大家眼睛不亮，光看表面不看本质，如有人只看到一个曾经当过国民党宪兵的人现在“生产还是乖”，便认为他可以入社。这时一个老社的工作人员就以老社建立时吸收了一户富农，以后这个富农在社内如何进行剥削和破坏活动的事实，向大家敲起了警钟，使大家进一步体会到保证农业生产合作社的纯洁的重要性，认真坚持了社员的条件。这个社的建社工作进入土地评产时，一部分群众要把产量压得很低，另一部分群众又要评高。老社又派了工作人员在群众会上以老社去年评产中的实例，讲清了产量评低就会伤害田多田好的人的生产积极性，而产量评高又会使田少劳动力多的人吃亏，其结果都会影响农业生产合作社的巩固的道理，教育大家进一步认清了目前的农业生产合作社的半社会主义性质，从而正确地进行了评产工作。很明显，向筹备建社的农民群众宣传建社办法，实际上就是向他们宣传党关于农业合作化的方针政策，而且是一种更为具体的宣传。
    从上面的例子可以看出，组织老社社员向社外群众宣传农业生产合作社的优越性和党关于农业合作化的方针政策和办法，能够收到吸引社外群众积极走上合作化道路的良好效果。而且这种做法对于老社社员本身也是一种教育——教育他们提高对社外群众的责任感，教育他们加深对农业生产合作社的优越性和党的方针政策的认识。这一群众自我教育的宣传方法和运用群众中的先进部分带动后进部分的群众路线工作方法，是值得推广的。当然，我们在组织老社社员向社外群众进行宣传时，不但要求他们宣传合作化的好处，也应当要求他们指出合作化过程中会遇到的困难。这样，我们才不只是能够鼓舞起广大农民办社的热情，同时也能够使他们有充分的精神准备来克服办社中的任何困难。
