Respected Chairman Comrade! Dear comrades and friends!

Today, the Vietnamese people celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with great joy and excitement. The founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a landmark day in the nearly hundred-year-long arduous and complex struggle of the Vietnamese people to finally defeat the heinous rule of French imperialism and Japanese fascism. It not only eloquently proves that the era of colonialists rampaging in Asia is gone forever, but also shows the world that the sacred cause of liberating the nation and defending the motherland of an awakened nation that has mastered its own destiny cannot be defeated by any reactionary force.

The victory of the Vietnamese national liberation movement is inseparable from the guidance of the revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The great October Revolution pointed out a broad road of national liberation for the oppressed nations of the world. The Vietnamese working class awakened and stepped onto the political stage. Its vanguard party—the Indochinese Communist Party (now the Vietnam Workers' Party)—armed itself with Marxism-Leninism from its inception and quickly pushed the national liberation movement onto the road to victory.

Due to the close relationship between China and Vietnam in terms of history, geography, economy, and culture, and due to the similarity of their revolutionary nature, the Chinese revolution played a decisive role in the Vietnamese revolution. During World War II, under the leadership of the Vietnamese working class party and its outstanding leader, President Ho Chi Minh, a broad Vietnamese National United Front was established. It mobilized the people of the whole country and organized guerrillas to severely punish the Japanese fascist bandits with armed forces. In 1945, with the coordination of favorable domestic and international situations, the Vietnamese people won the victory of the August Revolution and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is a victory of the Vietnamese people drawing on the valuable revolutionary experience of the Chinese people, and also a victory of the practical application of Chairman Mao Zedong's three magic weapons of revolution in Vietnam.

Undoubtedly, the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam not only announced the death of the colonial system in Vietnam, but also inspired the liberation movements of oppressed nations around the world. This made international imperialists panic. Therefore, at the beginning of the founding of the Republic, British colonial troops and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops invaded Vietnam under the guise of accepting the surrender of the Japanese army, and later the French colonialists, under the instigation and support of these international reactionary forces, continued to carry out bloody crimes to strangle the Republic, attempting to put the shackles of slavery back on the Vietnamese people. At that time, the Vietnamese people had just seized a backward and fragmented economic inheritance from the hands of the colonialists, the organization of the regime was not yet sound, and the people's armed forces lacked weapons, ammunition, and combat experience. Conversely, the French aggressor forces had modern equipment and received a constant stream of weapons and money from American interventionists. They attempted to destroy this newly born people's democratic country, which grew up from Asian colonies, with a "quick battle and quick decision."

However, the heroic Vietnamese people, under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, united as one and launched a life-and-death struggle with the imperialists with all their strength. Guerrilla warfare flourished throughout the country. The People's Army gradually grew stronger from weak to strong, giving the enemy severe blows everywhere. In particular, the victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign in May 1954 made the French aggressors fall into a state of collapse. In the political aspect, the so-called "independent" puppet show played by the French colonialists to cooperate with their military aggression also went bankrupt one after another.

While leading the war of resistance, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also adopted a series of democratic reforms and constructions in political, economic, and cultural aspects. The National Assembly, established through universal suffrage in 1946, formulated a democratic constitution: workers improved their lives under the protection of labor laws; farmers turned over in the implementation of the land reform policy of "land to the tiller"; various small industries and handicrafts were supported and developed; People's education, especially worker-peasant education and the work of eliminating illiteracy, has achieved great achievements. More than 14 million illiterate people in the liberated areas have escaped the suffering of illiteracy.

The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people to defend the fruits of the August Revolution was not isolated. The resistance forces of the Cambodian and Lao people also grew stronger, the movement of the French people demanding an end to the "dirty war" of aggression against Indochina became increasingly magnificent, and the forces of the people of the world to defend peace became increasingly profound. Under the pressure of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, the French colonialists had no choice but to sign an agreement on the cessation of hostilities at the Geneva Conference, and recognized that they must respect Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.

If the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is glorious and has withstood the test of a cruel war, then after the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also firmly committed to peace and is working entirely in accordance with the Geneva Accords. It has taken over all the areas north of the 17th parallel in an orderly manner, including the capital Hanoi, the port of Haiphong, the fertile Red River Delta, and the rich Hong Gai coal mining area, and quickly healed the wounds of war. In just one year after the peace, in terms of agricultural water conservancy, eight water conservancy irrigation systems have been repaired, allowing 252,000 hectares of farmland to be irrigated. To prevent the rainy season and floods, dikes with a length of about 2,740 kilometers have been completed in time. In terms of transportation, the Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway line, known as "Peace and Friendship," was fully restored in just over three months. The roadbeds of the Hanoi-Nam Dinh and Hanoi-Viet Tri railway lines have been laid. The Hong Gai coal mine has continued production after liberation. The rent reduction movement and land reform are being fully advanced in northern Vietnam. According to the plan of the Republic's government, land reform will be fully completed next year.

At this moment, U.S. imperialism is increasingly intensifying its interference in the internal affairs of the Indochinese countries. Less than two months after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the United States convened the "Manila Conference," openly including South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into the so-called "protection" scope of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. It also signed a "U.S.-Cambodia Military Agreement" with the Royal Government of Cambodia, and instructed the Lao authorities to attack the gathering areas of the Lao fighting forces, Sam Neua and Phongsaly; it also planned to sign a military agreement with the Kingdom of Laos to undermine the neutral status and free general election of Cambodia and Laos. In South Vietnam, the United States illegally transported in military personnel and weapons and ammunition, and this year, it specially allocated 200 million U.S. dollars to the Ngo Dinh Diem group as funds for equipping and expanding the puppet army. Under the instigation of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem group treated peace-loving people and former participants in the war of resistance with terrorist means. In the past year, more than 3,000 bloody incidents have been created in the area south of the temporary military demarcation line, and infighting has occurred with various sects and gangs, causing inestimable losses to the lives and property of the people of South Vietnam.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly stated its willingness to faithfully fulfill the Geneva Accords, and has sent notes to the authorities in South Vietnam requesting that consultation conferences be held in accordance with the dates stipulated in the Geneva Accords to discuss the matter of general elections. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem group unreasonably refused and refused to acknowledge its obligation to undertake the Geneva Accords. July 20 this year was the date stipulated in the Geneva Accords for consultations between the South and North of Vietnam on general elections. However, on this day, they instigated thugs to besiege the residences of personnel of the International Supervisory and Supervisory Commission, insulted the personnel of the commission, looted their property, and burned their cars. The U.S. imperialism openly expressed its appreciation and support for this brazen act of destroying international agreements and deliberately antagonizing the Vietnamese people by Ngo Dinh Diem, regardless of the condemnation of world opinion. This fully proves that U.S. imperialism is painstakingly carrying out the long-term division of Vietnamese territory, attempting to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base. This not only endangers Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, but also seriously threatens peace and security in Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people and government have always believed that the Geneva Accords cannot be undermined and the obligation to fulfill the agreement must not be evaded. We firmly oppose this perverse act of U.S. imperialism, and we firmly demand that the Southern authorities negotiate with us to conduct free general elections to unify our motherland.

It is very clear that this struggle is very complex. But it embodies the common aspiration of the Vietnamese people, conforms to the requirements of peace-loving people all over the world, and it will surely receive the warm support and support of the entire Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

Not long ago, when the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, was invited to visit China and the Soviet Union, the governments of China and the Soviet Union and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued joint communiqués, clearly stating their positions on international issues and the situation in Indochina, unanimously condemning U.S. imperialism for undermining the Geneva Accords, and emphasizing that consultation conferences must be held to realize free general elections to unify Vietnam. In order to assist the Vietnamese people in restoring and developing the national economy and improving cultural living standards, the Chinese and Soviet governments have also donated construction funds worth 153 billion Vietnamese dong to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and will provide us with materials, machinery, and technical personnel free of charge. Other brotherly countries such as the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, and the Mongolian People's Republic have also supported our position and given us great assistance in material and spiritual terms. This selfless and generous help, which comes from the spirit of proletarian internationalism, has deeply moved and inspired the Vietnamese people.

The close relationship between the people of Vietnam and China is just as President Ho Chi Minh said at the banquet held by Premier Zhou Enlai to welcome the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: "We are not only friendly neighbors, but also brothers in adversity." The Vietnamese people will never forget that when they were still in the most difficult days of the war of resistance, or on the first day after the restoration of peace, the fraternal Chinese people extended their most enthusiastic hands to help them. The Vietnamese people deeply feel that it is a great pride to have such a great neighbor.

On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, looking back at the road we have traveled, the Vietnamese people will move forward more courageously. We firmly believe that our just cause will once again win a glorious victory.

Long live the peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Vietnam!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Vietnam and China!

Long live the world peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live peace in Asia and the world!

### 越南民主共和国驻华大使黄文欢的讲话

    越南民主共和国驻华大使黄文欢的讲话敬爱的主席同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    今天，越南人民以非常愉快和兴奋的心情来庆祝越南民主共和国成立十周年。越南民主共和国的成立，是越南人民近百年来经过艰苦复杂的斗争终于打垮法帝国主义和日本法西斯罪恶的统治的具有划时代意义的日子。它不仅雄辩地证明殖民主义者在亚洲横行霸道的时代已一去不复返了，同时也向世界显示：一个觉醒了的、掌握着自己命运的民族，它的解放民族、保卫祖国的神圣事业是任何反动力量所不能挫败的。
    越南民族解放运动的胜利是和马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的革命理论指导分不开的。伟大的十月革命给全世界被压迫的民族指出了一条民族解放的康庄道路。越南工人阶级觉醒了并登上政治舞台。它的先锋政党——印度支那共产党（现在是越南劳动党）一诞生就以马列主义武装了自己，并把民族解放运动很快地推上了胜利之路。
    中国和越南由于历史、地理、经济、文化各方面关系的密切，和由于彼此革命性质的类同，所以中国革命对越南革命的影响也起了决定的作用。第二次世界大战期间，在越南工人阶级政党及其杰出的领袖胡志明主席的领导下，一个广泛的越南民族统一战线建立起来了。它动员全国人民，组织了游击队以武装力量痛惩日本法西斯匪军。一九四五年，在国内外有利形势的配合下，越南人民取得了八月革命的胜利，建立了越南民主共和国。这是越南人民吸取中国人民宝贵的革命经验的胜利，也是毛泽东主席的革命三大法宝在越南实践的胜利。
    无可置疑地，越南民主共和国的成立不仅是宣布了殖民主义制度在越南的死亡，同时也鼓舞了全世界被压迫民族的解放运动。这就使得国际帝国主义者感到惊慌失措。所以当共和国奠基之初，英国殖民军和蒋介石匪军在接受日军投降名义下分别侵占了越南，而后来法国殖民者就在这种国际反动力量的怂恿和支援的情况下，继续进行扼杀共和国的血腥罪行，图谋把奴隶锁链重又加在越南人民身上。当时，越南人民刚从殖民者的手中夺来一份落后的和支离破碎的经济遗产，政权机构的组织也还不够健全，人民武装部队缺少武器、弹药和作战经验。相反地，法国侵略军拥有现代化装备，且源源不绝地得到美国干涉者大量武器和金钱的援助，他们企图以“速战速决”来摧毁从亚洲殖民地生长起来的这个新生的人民民主国家。
    但是英勇的越南人民在越南劳动党正确的领导下，团结一致，以全副力量和帝国主义者展开生死斗争。游击战争在全国范围内蓬勃发展。人民军由弱到强地逐步生长壮大起来，处处给敌人以严重的打击。特别是一九五四年五月间奠边府战役的胜利，更使得法国侵略者陷于一蹶不振的地步。在政治方面，法国殖民者为配合他们的军事侵略而扮演出来的所谓“独立”的傀儡丑剧也一个接着一个地破产了。
    越南民主共和国在领导抗战的同时，又在政治、经济、文化各方面采取了一系列的民主改革和建设。一九四六年由全国普选而成立的国民大会制定了民主的宪法：工人在劳动法保护之下改善了自己的生活；农民在“耕者有其田”的土改政策的实施中翻了身；各种小工业和手工业得到扶助和发展；人民教育尤其是工农教育和扫除文盲工作更取得巨大的成就，解放区的一千四百多万目不识丁的人民摆脱了文盲的痛苦。
    越南人民为保卫八月革命的成果而进行抗战的英勇斗争并不是孤立的。柬埔寨和老挝人民的抗战力量也日益壮大，法国人民要求结束侵略印度支那的“肮脏战争”的运动日益波澜壮阔，全世界人民保卫和平的力量日益深广，就在越南人民和全世界人民力量的压力下，法国殖民者不得不在日内瓦会议上签订停止敌对行动的协定，而且承认要尊重越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。
    如果说，越南民主共和国是光辉的，经得起残酷的战争考验的，那末在和平恢复后，越南民主共和国政府也是坚决拥护和平并完全按照日内瓦协议进行工作的。它已把十七度线以北地区，其中包括首都河内、海防港和肥沃的红河三角洲以及丰饶的鸿基煤矿区等都井然有序地全部接管过来，迅速地医治了战争的创伤。仅以和平后一年间来说，在农业水利方面，八个水利灌溉系统已经修复，使二十五万二千公顷田地得到灌溉。为预防雨季和洪汛，长约二千七百四十公里的堤坝已及时修筑完成。在交通运输方面，这条被称誉为“和平友谊”的河内—睦南关铁路线在短短的三个多月内全线修复。河内—南定、河内—越池两条铁路线的路基已经铺好。解放后的鸿基煤矿已继续生产。减租运动和土地改革正在越南北方全面地推进着，按照共和国政府的计划，土地改革明年可全部完成。
    正当这个时候，美帝国主义却日益变本加厉地干涉印度支那各国的内政。日内瓦协议签订后不满两个月，美国就召开了“马尼拉会议”，公然把越南南方、柬埔寨、老挝划入东南亚侵略集团的所谓“保护”范围。它还和柬埔寨王国政府签订一项“美柬军事协定”，指使老挝当局进攻寮国战斗部队的集结区桑怒和丰沙里；而且还策划同老挝王国签订军事协定，以破坏柬埔寨和老挝的中立地位和自由普选。在越南南方，美国违法地运入军事人员和武器弹药，并于今年内特别拨给吴庭艳集团二亿美元作为装备和扩充伪军的费用。由于美国的唆使，吴庭艳集团竟以恐怖手段对待渴望和平的民众和以前参加抗战的人员。一年来在临时军事分界线以南地区先后制造了三千多起的血腥事件，并和各教派、帮派发生火併，致使越南南方人民的生命财产蒙受了不可估计的损失。
  越南民主共和国政府已经屡次表明愿忠诚履行日内瓦协议，并照会给越南南方当局要求按照日内瓦协议规定日期举行协商会议以讨论普选事宜。可是吴庭艳集团却无理拒绝，不肯承认有承担日内瓦协议的义务。今年七月二十日是日内瓦协议规定越南南、北双方协商普选的日子。可是，他们竟在这一天怂恿暴徒围攻国际监督和监察委员会人员住所，侮辱委员会人员，劫夺其财物，焚烧其汽车。像吴庭艳这种明目张胆破坏国际协议和蓄意与越南人民为敌的强盗行为，美帝国主义不顾世界舆论的谴责竟公然表示赞赏和支持。这充分证明，美帝国主义正在处心积虑地进行长期分割越南领土的勾当，妄图变越南南方为美国的军事基地。这不但危害了越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整，而且亚洲和世界的和平和安全也遭受严重的威胁。越南人民和政府始终认为日内瓦协议不容许破坏，履行协议的义务绝不容许规避。我们坚决反对美帝国主义的这种倒行逆施，我们坚决要求南方当局和我们协商进行自由普选以统一我们祖国。
    十分明显，这个斗争是非常复杂的。但它却体现着越南人民的共同愿望，符合于全世界爱好和平人民的要求，它一定会得到全越南人民和全世界人民的热烈支持和拥护的。
    不久以前，当以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团应邀访问了中国和苏联，中苏两国政府和越南民主共和国政府分别发表了联合公报，明确表明对国际问题和印度支那形势的立场，一致谴责美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议的行为，并强调指出必须举行协商会议，实现自由普选以统一越南。为了协助越南人民恢复和发展国民经济以及提高文化生活水平，中国和苏联政府同时还赠送给越南民主共和国政府以价值一万五千三百亿越币的建设资金，并将无偿地供给我们以物资、机器和技术人员。其他兄弟国家如德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国等也支持我们的立场，并在物质上和精神上给我们以很大的援助。这种出自无产阶级国际主义精神的、无私和慷慨的帮助，使越南人民深受感激和鼓舞。
    越中两国人民的密切关系，正如胡志明主席在周恩来总理欢迎越南民主共和国政府代表团的宴会上所说的：“我们不但是友好邻邦，同时也是患难的兄弟。”越南人民永远不会忘记，当他们还在抗战最困难的日子里，或在恢复和平后的第一天，兄弟的中国人民伸出最热情的手来帮助他们。越南人民深切地感到有了这样一个伟大的邻邦而引为莫大的骄傲。
    值此庆祝越南民主共和国成立十周年之际，回顾过去所经历的道路，越南人民将更加奋勇前进。我们深信，我们的正义事业会再一次赢得光辉的胜利。
    和平、统一、独立和民主的越南万岁！
    越中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主和社会主义阵营万岁！
    亚洲和世界和平万岁！
