Line-Drawing Group Strives to Save Steel
Zhang Chuanqi

    For every large hydroelectric generator manufactured by Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, tens or even hundreds of tons of steel are needed. More than 95 percent of this steel is used by the cold working workshop during the manufacturing process. Whether steel is used reasonably mainly depends on the line-drawing group of the second workshop section. Their task is to first draw the shapes of various components on steel plates according to the sizes and shapes specified in the blueprints, and then hand them over to the cutting group for cutting. Only when the drawing is reasonable can the cutting be reasonable; otherwise, steel will be wasted.
    This line-drawing group consists of six young people, and production team leader Li Shou'an is a Harbin model worker. Li Shou'an is very clear about the importance of saving steel. He often says: "Steel is too precious. Without it, we cannot build large factories, railways, and bridges, nor can we manufacture airplanes and artillery. Saving a little more steel is adding more strength to socialist construction." Under his influence, the comrades in their group also pay great attention to saving steel. Once, the factory trial-produced a 10,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generator, and the components they drew lines for numbered in the thousands. Every day, they carefully studied each component according to its size and shape, considering how to cut reasonably before drawing lines. As a result, a total of eight tons of steel plates were saved.
    Since the launch of the anti-waste campaign, the leaders of the cold working workshop have paid more attention to reducing steel consumption. The workshop director analyzed the past steel usage and found that although they had saved eight tons of steel when trial-producing the 10,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generator, the steel utilization rate was only 70 percent. This meant that the steel utilization rate could be further improved, and the consumption quota could be further reduced. Therefore, he convened the workers of the line-drawing group and also invited the leading staff of the factory's technology department and raw materials supply department to jointly study how to save more steel. The result of the research was that everyone believed that in the past, only a few dozen urgently needed components were drawn each day. Therefore, when drawing lines, they could only consider how to be reasonable within this range. At the same time, in the past, line drawing was done one component next to another, instead of arranging all components on the steel plate before drawing, so it was impossible to cut very reasonably. Everyone decided that in the future, line drawing must be done all at once.
    In mid-July, the factory began manufacturing a 7,500-kilowatt hydroelectric generator. The raw materials supply department gave the line-drawing group all the steel plates needed to manufacture this generator at once, and the technology department also sent all the blueprints to the line-drawing group. In this way, the line-drawing group could consider how to achieve reasonable cutting requirements within a larger range when drawing lines. However, this also brought more difficulties to the line-drawing group: they had to be familiar with dozens of blueprints before drawing lines; during the line-drawing process, they had to repeatedly study each blueprint; otherwise, they could not fully and reasonably arrange various components of different sizes and shapes on each steel plate. However, they were not afraid of difficulties. Everyone worked hard to study, and the comrades in the technology department provided specific assistance. They quickly improved their ability to familiarize themselves with blueprints. Before formally drawing lines, they also carefully used the blueprints to repeatedly compare them on the steel plates. For components with special shapes, they first cut out paper shapes to compare them until they were completely reasonable before formally drawing lines. Sometimes, the components drawn on a steel plate included those that were urgently needed and those that would not be used for another month. To avoid omissions or repetitions, they also established a record system to record the components that had been drawn; and they suggested that the section establish a material transfer system to strengthen the responsibility of each group and prevent loss. They also further reduced the cutting allowance between components. In the past, the distance between components was 15 centimeters, but now it has been reduced to 5 centimeters. The workers in the cutting group were also very careful when cutting. Although the allowance was very small, they did not cut a single piece wrong or badly. All the steel plates needed for the 7,500-kilowatt hydroelectric generator were cut. The original quota was 60 tons of steel plates, but they actually used only 51 tons. The raw material consumption quota was reduced by 15 percent, and the steel plate utilization rate increased from 70 percent to 85 percent. Now, this line-drawing group has been named the Youth Savings Group, and team leader Li Shou'an will attend the provincial youth socialist construction activists conference. The entire group of workers decided to propose to all young workers in the province at this conference to reduce raw material consumption and increase raw material utilization.

    努力节约钢材的画线小组
    张传岐
    哈尔滨电机厂每制成一台大型水轮发电机，就需要几十吨甚至上百吨的钢材。这些钢材有百分之九十五以上在制造过程中是冷作车间用的。钢材使用得是否合理，主要又决定于二工段的画线小组。因为他们的任务是按照图纸上规定的各种部件的大小和形状，先在钢板上划出样子来，然后再交给器割小组去剪裁。只有画得合理，才能剪裁得合理，否则就会浪费钢材。
    这个画线小组是由六名青年人组成的，生产组长李守安是哈尔滨市劳动模范。李守安对于节约钢材的重要意义是十分清楚的，他常说：“钢材太贵重啦，没有它，就不能盖大工厂、不能修铁路、桥梁，不能制造飞机、大炮。多节约一点钢材，就是为社会主义建设多增加一分力量。”他们小组的同志在他的影响下，也都很注意节约钢材。有一次，厂里试制一台一万瓩水轮发电机，由他们画线的部件就有好几千件，他们每天都按照大小和形状，反复地认真地研究每一个部件，考虑怎样剪裁才合理，然后再画线，结果共节约了八吨钢板。
    反浪费斗争开展以后，冷作车间的领导人员对于降低钢材消耗更加重视了。车间主任分析了过去钢材的使用情况，发现他们在试制一万瓩水轮发电机时虽然已节约了八吨钢材，但是钢材的利用率还只达到了百分之七十。这就是说，钢材的利用率还可以提高，消耗定额还可以降低。于是他就召集了画线小组的工人，还邀请了厂里工艺科和原材料供应科的领导工作人员一齐开会研究怎样才能节约更多的钢材。研究的结果，大家认为过去每天只是画当前急需的几十件部件，因此在画线时只能在这个范围内考虑怎样合理；同时，过去画线是一个部件挨着一个部件地画，而不是把所有部件全部在钢板上安排好以后再画，所以不可能裁剪得很合理。大家决定今后一定要一次画线。
    七月中旬，厂里开始制造七千五百瓩水轮发电机。原材料供应科就将制造这台发电机所需要的钢板一次拨给了画线小组，工艺科也把图纸全部送到画线小组来。这样，画线小组在画线时就能在更大的范围内考虑如何达到合理剪裁的要求了。但是，这样做，也给画线小组带来了更多的困难：在画线前必须熟悉几十张图纸；画线过程中，还要反复研究每一张图纸；否则就不能在每块钢板上都充分合理地安排各种大小形状不同的部件。但是，他们不怕困难，大家努力钻研，工艺科的同志们又具体地帮助，他们很快就提高了熟悉图纸的能力。在正式画线前，他们还十分仔细地用图纸在钢板上反复比量，形状特别的部件，就先用纸剪出样子来比量，一直到完全合理时才正式画线。有时，画在一块钢板上的部件，有的是当前急需的，有的要在一个月以后才能用上。为了避免遗漏或重复，他们又建立了记录制度，把已画过的部件记下来；并且建议工段建立物品转移制度，加强了各组的责任心，防止丢失。他们还进一步缩小了部件间的剪裁留量。过去部件和部件间要留十五厘米的距离，现在已缩小到五厘米。器割小组工人剪裁时也十分细心，虽然留量很小，也没有裁错和裁坏一件。七千五百瓩水轮发电机需要的钢板全部剪裁完了。原来的定额是六十吨钢板，他们实际只用了五十一吨。原材料消耗定额降低了百分之十五，钢板的利用率由百分之七十提高到百分之八十五。现在，这个画线小组被命名为青年节约小组，组长李守安将要出席省的青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。全组工人决定要在这次大会上，向全省青年职工提出降低原材料消耗，提高原材料利用率的倡议。
