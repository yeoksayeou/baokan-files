Doing a Good Job in Supplying Industrial Goods During the Peak Season

    Early rice is beginning to be harvested, and autumn crops are also expected to have a bumper harvest. The market is now gradually entering its peak season. In addition to gradually carrying out the procurement of various agricultural and sideline products in accordance with the state's unified purchase and procurement plans, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must also quickly prepare for the supply of industrial products in order to fully meet the needs of the peak season market, especially the rural market, for daily-use industrial products.
    The characteristics of this year's peak season are: on the one hand, agricultural and sideline products are having a bumper harvest in most areas, and state procurement is more concentrated, so people's purchasing power, mainly farmers' purchasing power, may suddenly increase. On the other hand, the state has a sufficient supply of industrial products, and the inventory of most commodities has increased by more than 25% compared with the same period last year. Therefore, doing a good job in supplying the market during this year's peak season is not only necessary, but also entirely possible. The primary task at present is to fully estimate the characteristics of market development during this year's peak season and to rationally and promptly allocate the reserved daily-use industrial products to grassroots wholesale units.
    The commodity allocation situation this year has improved compared with last year. Nationally, approximately 90% of the commodities have been allocated to provinces (cities). From the perspective of various provinces, 60% to 70% of the inventory commodities in most provinces have been allocated to state-owned grassroots stores. However, we should never be satisfied with these achievements. In order to more fully supply the needs of the rural market after autumn, we must further continue to rationally allocate the commodities already reserved by first-level and second-level wholesale stations and the commodities increased in the fourth quarter to grassroots sales units. To do a good job in this task, we must continue to carry out arduous ideological and organizational work.
    Currently, in terms of state-owned commercial enterprises, due to the impact of last year's floods on trade in the first half of the year, the sales plan was not well completed, and some cadres have developed pessimistic thoughts, underestimating the characteristics of this year's peak season. In addition, a slightly larger amount of industrial products was allocated in the first quarter, and supply and marketing cooperatives have not yet prepared for the peak season's commodities and have purchased less goods. As a result, some units have large inventories, which has led to the phenomenon of trying to request as few or as late commodities as possible from higher-level wholesale institutions. On the supply and marketing cooperative side, there was some blindness in allocating commodities at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Some commodities that were not suitable for rural needs were also allocated to rural areas, resulting in the occupation of state funds and the easy deterioration and damage of commodities that were stored in warehouses for a long time. In order to correct this situation, the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued a joint instruction allowing cooperatives to return truly unsellable commodities and stipulating a certain turnover inventory for cooperatives. However, in the implementation of this work, another deviation occurred. Some cooperatives simply reduced their inventory and returned goods that should not have been returned. As a result, a district cooperative in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, had no handkerchiefs, soap, or thermos bottles, and only one item of matches in stock. A district cooperative in Guilin Prefecture returned 25 bolts of cloth, leaving only 23 bolts in total inventory. The quantity of industrial products purchased by cooperatives from state-owned commercial enterprises in July continued to decline compared to June. The industrial product inventory of cooperatives in some counties was only enough for half a month of sales. Obviously, these situations are not in line with the characteristics of this year's peak season market and the responsibilities borne by socialist commerce for the market. If this situation is not changed quickly, it will not only hinder the supply of industrial products to the rural market during the peak season, but also affect the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, which is detrimental to the state and the people.
    In order to change this situation, the leadership at all levels of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives must strengthen the education of employees, explaining to them that although the off-season was relatively weak in the first half of this year, the market after autumn will be even busier due to this year's bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline products and the implementation of the "Three Fixes" policy for grain. The recent sudden increase in the sales of state-owned commercial enterprises in some areas by a factor of two to four after the early rice was put on the market in Anhui and Hunan is a good example. Therefore, state-owned commercial enterprises in various regions must quickly prepare for industrial products to go to the countryside based on the sales rules of previous years and the characteristics of this year's market, correctly allocating commodities to grassroots stores or wholesale stations near the sales areas, so that grassroots wholesale groups, cooperatives, and private small vendors can pick up goods at any time, and further vigorously promote sales during the peak season, overfulfilling the sales plan for the second half of the year and striving to complete and overfulfill the annual plan. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must also immediately focus their work on preparing materials for peak season supply, stop the practice of compressing inventory, reasonably expand the variety of commodities in wholesale and retail departments, appropriately expand necessary reserves, and carry out commodity variety adjustments through expanded sales. Units whose inventory has been reduced to only about 20 days should do a better job in purchasing goods and submit requisition plans to state-owned commercial enterprises in a timely manner as needed so that state-owned commercial enterprises can prepare goods in advance. Whether it is state-owned commercial enterprises or supply and marketing cooperatives, in the work of expanding commodity allocation and increasing commodity varieties, they must resolutely implement the principle of giving priority to supplying the rural areas with industrial products that are needed by both urban and rural areas, and resolutely prohibiting the allocation of products that are not needed in the rural areas to the rural areas.
    In order to do a good job in supplying the peak season, complex and arduous organizational work is also required. First, it is necessary to strengthen and enrich grassroots state-owned wholesale institutions, equip them with sufficient business personnel for direct wholesale, so that they can not only cope adequately with the business in wholesale outlets during the peak season, but also have a certain number of personnel to contact cooperatives on a contracted basis, understand the needs of cooperatives, meet the purchase requirements of cooperatives as much as possible, and actively help cooperatives develop wholesale business to rural small vendors and peddlers, and reasonably expand the variety of operations. Supply and marketing cooperatives should also enrich cadres and actively promote sales to expand the leading force of socialist commerce in the rural market during the peak season, meet the needs of the vast number of farmers for daily-use industrial products, and support the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. Second, it is necessary to further arrange the market, strengthen supervision and leadership over private merchants, lead them to organize industrial product sales exhibitions in rural distribution markets, participate in various urban and rural material exchange fairs and various temple fairs and markets, and continue to promote the sales method of door-to-door delivery to the countryside. Finally, and most importantly, when purchasing and allocating commodities, it is necessary to consider the color, variety, specification, and price of the commodities to suit the needs of local farmers, do everything possible to increase the commodities currently favored by local farmers, and at the same time, based on the purchase and current inventory, actively publicize and promote new commodities that are suitable for local consumption levels. Only by doing the above work can we meet the needs of the vast number of farmers for daily-use industrial products, expand the sales of industrial products in rural areas, and ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the sales tasks.
    Doing a good job in promoting industrial products, especially promoting them in the rural market during the peak season after autumn, is of great significance for meeting the needs of farmers, supporting procurement, withdrawing currency, stabilizing prices, expanding the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Strengthening the combination of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises is an important key to doing a good job in supplying industrial products to the rural market during the peak season. Under the leadership of local party committees, state-owned stores and cooperatives should coordinate and work together to prepare materials and cooperate with each other in other business aspects, vigorously expand the wholesale business and market supply for retail private merchants, supply a large number of industrial products to farmers, and strive to successfully complete the great tasks of socialist commerce in 1955.

### 做好旺季工业品的供应工作

    做好旺季工业品的供应工作
    早稻已经开始登场，秋后作物也丰收在望，目前市场正逐步进入旺季。各地国营商业和供销合作社，除了按照国家的统购、收购计划，逐步开展对各种农副产品的收购外，还必须迅速做好工业品供应的准备工作，以便充分满足旺季市场、特别是满足农村市场对日用工业品的需要。
    今年旺季的特点是：一方面农副产品在大部分地区丰收，国家收购又较集中，人民的购买力，主要是农民的购买力将可能出现突然增高的现象。另一方面，国家已掌握了充裕的工业品，大部分商品库存都比去年同期增长百分之二十五以上。因此做好今年旺季供应工作，不仅必要，而且也是完全可能的。当前的首要工作，就是要充分估计今年旺季市场发展的特点，把储备的日用工业品合理地、及时地调拨到基层批发单位去。
    今年商品调拨的情况比去年已有改进，从全国来说，大体上有百分之九十的商品已调拨到省（市）；从各省的情况来看，多数省的库存商品中，又有百分之六十到七十已经调拨到国营基层商店。但是，我们决不应该满足这些成绩，为了更充分地供应秋后农村市场的需要，还须进一步根据市场发展的情况，把一级批发站和二级批发站已储备的商品和第四季度增加的商品继续合理地调拨到基层销售单位去。为了作好这项工作，就要继续进行艰巨的思想工作和组织工作。
    目前，在国营商业方面，由于上半年的贸易受去年水灾影响，销售计划完成得不好，一部分干部产生了消极思想，对今年旺季的特点估计不足；再加上第一季度有一部分工业品调拨略多了一些，而供销合作社又还没有做好准备旺季商品的工作，进货较少，因而有些单位库存较大，这就发生了向上级批发机构尽量少要或晚要商品的现象。在供销合作社方面，去年年底和今年年初调拨商品时曾经有一些盲目性，某些根本不适合农村需要的商品，也调拨到了农村，结果占压了国家资金，也使商品长期放在仓库里容易变质损坏。为了纠正这种情况，商业部和全国合作总社曾发出联合指示，允许合作社退回真正不能销售的商品，并规定了合作社一定的周转库存。但在执行这一工作中，又发生了另一种偏向，有些合作社单纯压缩库存，将不应该退的货也退了。结果，江西丰城县的一个区社，手帕、肥皂、热水瓶都没有，火柴库存只有一件；桂林专区一个区社退了二十五匹布后，全部库存只有二十三匹。七月份合作社向国营商业进货数量，比六月份继续下降，有些县的合作社工业品库存，只够半个月销售。很显然，这些情况是和今年旺季市场的特点和社会主义商业对市场所担负的责任不相适应的。如果不迅速改变这种情况，不仅会妨碍旺季农村市场的工业品供应，也会影响农副产品的收购工作，对国家和人民都是不利的。
    为了改变这种情况，国营商业和供销合作社的各级领导机构，必须加强对职工的教育，向他们说明今年上半年虽然淡季较淡，但由于今年农副产品丰收，和粮食“三定”政策的贯彻执行，秋后市场将会出现旺季更旺的情况。最近安徽和湖南早稻上市后，某些地方的国营商业销售额突然增加一倍到四倍，就是很好的例子。因此，各地国营商业必须根据历年来的销售规律和今年市场的特点，迅速做好工业品下乡的准备工作，把商品正确地调拨到接近销售地区的基层商店或者批发站，以便基层批发小组、合作社和私商小贩随时取货，并趁旺季进一步大力推销，超额完成下半年销售计划，争取全年计划的完成和超额完成。各地供销合作社也必须立即把工作重点放在为旺季供应准备物资方面，停止压缩库存的作法，合理地扩大批发、零售部门的商品品种，适当地扩大必要的储备，并从扩大推销中进行商品品种的调剂。有些库存已减少到只有二十天上下的单位，更应做好进货工作，根据需要及时地向国营商业提出要货计划，使国营商业能够提前准备商品。无论国营商业或供销合作社，在扩大调拨商品及增加商品品种的工作中，都要坚决贯彻城乡都需要的工业品，优先供应农村，农村不需要的，坚决禁止调拨到农村的方针。
    为了作好旺季供应，还需要进行复杂的艰巨的组织工作。首先就是要加强并充实基层国营批发机构，配备足够的直接批发的业务人员，使他们既能够在旺季充裕地应付批发门市上的业务，又能有一定人员分片包干联系合作社，了解合作社的需要，尽一切可能满足合作社的进货要求，并积极帮助合作社开展对农村小商贩和货郎担的批发业务，合理地扩大经营品种。供销合作社也应充实干部，积极推销，以扩大社会主义商业在旺季农村市场的领导力量，满足广大农民对日用工业品的需要，支持农副产品的收购工作。其次，就是要进一步安排好市场，加强对私商的监督和领导，领导他们在农村集散市场组织工业品出售展览会、参加各种城乡物资交流会和各种庙会集市，以及继续推行巡回送货下乡的推销方法。最后，也是最重要的工作，就是在采购商品和调拨商品的时候，必须考虑商品的花色、品种、规格、价格，使之适合当地农民的需要，尽一切可能增加当前当地农民所喜爱的商品，同时根据进货和当前库存的情况，积极宣传和推销新的而又适合当地消费水平的商品。只有作好了以上这些工作，才能满足广大农民对日用工业品的需要，才能够扩大工业品的在农村的销售工作，保证完成和争取超额完成销售任务。
    做好工业品的推销工作，特别是秋后旺季的推销工作，对满足农民需要、支援收购工作、回笼货币、稳定物价、扩大城乡物资交流、促进工农业生产的发展和巩固工农联盟有着重要意义，而加强国营商业和合作社商业的结合，则是做好旺季农村市场工业品供应的重要关键。国营商店和合作社，应在各地党委领导下，协调一致，做好物资准备和其他业务方面互相配合的工作，大力展开对零售私商的批购业务和市场供应，把大批工业品供应到农民手里，为胜利完成一九五五年的社会主义商业的巨大任务而努力。
