Notice on Strengthening the Promotion and Distribution of Newspapers and Magazines in Industrial and Mining Areas
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly issued a notice on strengthening the work of promoting and distributing newspapers and magazines in industrial and mining areas.

The notice stated that in the first quarter of 1955, the postal and telecommunications bureaus distributed more than 500,690 copies of workers' newspapers and more than 368,300 copies of magazines. However, many factories, mines, and workers still cannot easily subscribe to and receive the newspapers and magazines they need. Many postal and telecommunications bureaus are not good at relying on the mass organizations and the strength of the masses in factories and mines to actively carry out this work. At the same time, the grassroots organizations of trade unions and the Youth League in factories and mines have not paid enough attention to closely cooperating with the postal and telecommunications departments to organize workers to subscribe to newspapers and magazines and to use newspapers and magazines to carry out current political propaganda.

The notice requires that postal and telecommunications bureaus in various regions should take necessary measures, rely on trade unions and Youth League organizations at all levels, and continuously improve the work of distributing newspapers and magazines in industrial and mining areas. Trade unions and Youth League organizations at all levels must also actively cooperate with the postal and telecommunications bureaus to do a good job in promoting the sales of newspapers and magazines. In order to facilitate workers in industrial and mining areas to subscribe to and see newspapers and magazines in a timely manner, mass-based newspaper and magazine distribution stations should be established in factories and mines in a focused and step-by-step manner. Retail sales of newspapers and magazines can also be held during major holidays and when there are important political news. Postal and telecommunications bureaus should ensure the timely and accurate delivery of newspapers and magazines to the distribution stations. The grassroots organizations of trade unions and the Youth League in factories and mines should give support and assistance to the work of newspaper and magazine distribution stations.

The notice also requires trade unions and Youth League organizations at all levels to vigorously carry out newspaper reading activities and guide workers to read newspapers and magazines in order to further exert the organizing and educational role of newspapers and magazines.

    加强工矿区报刊发行工作
    中华人民共和国邮电部、中华全国总工会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会就加强工矿区报刊推广发行工作，发出联合通知。
    通知说，一九五五年第一季度邮电局发行的工人报纸有五十万零六千九百多份，杂志有三十六万八千三百多份。但是不少厂矿和职工群众还不能顺利订到和及时收到所需要的报刊，不少邮电局还不善于依靠厂矿的群众组织和群众力量积极地开展这一工作，同时工会和青年团的厂矿基层组织对于密切配合邮电部门，组织工人订阅报刊，并运用报刊来开展时事政治宣传工作，也还不够注意。
    通知要求，各地邮电局应采取必要措施，依靠工会和青年团的各级组织，不断改进工矿区的报刊发行工作；工会和青年团的各级组织，也须积极配合邮电局，作好报刊的推销工作。为便于工矿区职工订阅并及时看到报刊，应在厂矿企业中有重点有步骤地建立群众性的报刊发行站，并可在重大节日和有重要政治消息时，举办报刊零售工作。邮电局应保证及时和准确地投送发行站的报刊。工会和青年团在厂矿中的基层组织对报刊发行站的工作，应给予支持和帮助。
    通知并要求工会和青年团的各级组织，大力开展读报工作，指导工人阅读报刊，以进一步发挥报刊的组织和教育作用。（新华社）
