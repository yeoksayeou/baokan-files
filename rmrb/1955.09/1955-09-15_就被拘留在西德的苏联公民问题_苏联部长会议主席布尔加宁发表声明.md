TASS Moscow, September 13th: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, issued a statement regarding the issue of displaced Soviet citizens detained in West Germany. The full text of the statement is as follows:

During the last war, Hitler's troops forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians from the temporarily occupied Soviet territories to Germany. Many such Soviet people died in camps in Germany while being forced to work. After the defeat of Hitler's troops, the majority of displaced Soviet citizens who had survived had returned to their homeland. However, a considerable number have remained detained, mainly in West Germany.

According to available information, there are still over one hundred thousand such Soviet citizens in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, who are often referred to as "stateless persons." These unfortunate people, forcibly separated from their homeland and families, mostly lack fixed jobs, residences, and means of livelihood, and suffer extreme hardship and poverty. They are in the hands of others, in a position of powerlessness and dependence. We are also aware of many cases where displaced Soviet citizens, dissatisfied with their plight, are imprisoned in prisons in the Federal Republic of Germany.

Certain anti-Soviet organizations, with the support of the relevant authorities, are conducting malicious propaganda to obstruct repatriation, threatening and intimidating those who wish to return home. At the same time, some continue to attempt to exploit these people for nefarious political purposes, which is intolerable.

We believe that the situation of the displaced Soviet citizens in the Federal Republic of Germany is not normal and is contrary to the principles of humanity and personal freedom. The Soviet government considers it its duty to defend even those Soviet citizens who, under certain circumstances, have behaved badly towards their motherland. We hope they can mend their ways, and we will not punish them severely for their crimes.

We draw the attention of the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to this point, and at the same time hope that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany will take appropriate measures to assist the displaced Soviet citizens to return home.

    就被拘留在西德的苏联公民问题
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁发表声明
    新华社十四日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁就被拘留在西德的被迁移的苏联公民问题发表声明。声明全文如下：
    在上次战争期间，希特勒军队在被暂时占领的苏联领土上用武力硬把数十万苏联平民迁往德国。许许多多这样的苏联人在德国被强迫从事劳动时死于营地。希特勒军队覆灭后，保全了生命的大多数被迁移的苏联公民都已经回到祖国。但是还有不小一部分被拘留了，主要是被拘留在西德。
    据现有情报，在德意志联邦共和国领土上至今还有十万以上这样的苏联公民，他们往往被称为“没有国籍的人”。被强迫同祖国和家人隔绝的这些不幸的人，大多数都没有固定的工作、住所和生活资料，遭受极端的困苦和贫穷。他们是在别人的掌握之中，处于没有权利和依属别人的地位。我们还知道许多这样的情况：不满于自己困苦处境的被迁移的苏联公民，被囚禁在德意志联邦共和国的监狱里。
    某些敌视苏联的组织在有关当局支持之下，进行妨碍遣送回国的恶毒宣传，威胁和恐吓希望回国的人。同时，有人继续企图利用这些人达到罪恶的政治目的，这种企图是不能容忍的。
    我们认为，在德意志联邦共和国内的被迁移的苏联公民的处境，不是正常的，是同人道和人身自由的原则相违背的。苏联政府认为有责任同样维护那些在某种环境下对自己的祖国有过不好行为的苏联公民。我们希望他们能够改邪归正，我们将不因为他们的罪行而对他们加以严厉的惩罚。
    我们提请德意志联邦共和国政府代表团注意这一点，同时希望德意志联邦共和国政府采取应有的措施，协助被迁移的苏联公民回国。
