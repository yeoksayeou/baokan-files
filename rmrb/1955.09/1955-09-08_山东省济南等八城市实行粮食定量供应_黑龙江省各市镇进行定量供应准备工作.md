Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th. From September 1st to 5th, eight cities in Shandong Province with populations over 50,000 have implemented a fixed-quantity grain supply system. These cities are: Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weifang, Zibo, Tai'an, Weihai, and Jining. Residents have already formulated their September grain purchase plans according to the fixed-quantity supply standards. The planned grain sales volume for September in each city is less than in August.

More than 5,000 propagandists, reporters, and over 20,000 active members of the masses in these cities have not only explained the "Provisional Measures for Fixed-Quantity Grain Supply in Cities and Towns" to residents and the significance of implementing these measures, but also introduced experiences and methods for saving grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. Cities and towns in Heilongjiang Province are actively preparing to implement a fixed-quantity grain supply system. The vast majority of cities and towns throughout the province are conducting in-depth investigations into the grain consumption standards of various types of residents, dividing work categories, and further publicizing the great significance of saving grain. Harbin City will soon hold a radio conference, where the person in charge of the Municipal People's Committee will give a report on saving grain and implementing fixed-quantity supply. The districts in the city are successively holding grain exhibitions, exhibiting instances of grain waste by some residents and organizations, and exchanging experiences in saving grain. Almost every household in the city has now formulated a grain consumption plan. More than 1,100 collective food units throughout the city have improved their management methods to lay the foundation for implementing fixed-quantity supply.

Since the second half of August, cities and counties such as Jiamusi, Hegang, and Nenjiang in the province have successively implemented a fixed-quantity grain supply system. After Jiamusi City implemented fixed-quantity supply, the average monthly grain consumption per person was reduced by four and six-tenths jin compared to the first half of the year. After Nenjiang County implemented fixed-quantity supply, the average monthly grain supply was reduced by 98,000 jin compared to April to July.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. Thirteen kinds of raw and cooked foods sold by more than 16,000 food shops and vendors in Shanghai have been sold at fixed quality and price since September 5th. The unified price and quality standards were discussed and drafted by the relevant industry trade associations and district vendors' committees and approved by the government.

Currently, all shops and vendors have posted the quality standards and price lists for these foods. This practice has greatly reduced the deceptive activities of speculators who lower the quality of food and is very popular with customers.

    新华社济南七日电　从九月一日到五日，山东省已有八个五万人口以上的城市实行了粮食定量供应制度。这些城市是：济南、青岛、烟台、潍坊、淄博、泰安、威海、济宁。居民们已根据定量供应标准，订出了九月份的购粮计划。各城市九月份的粮食计划销售量都比八月份少。
    这些城市的五千多名宣传员、报告员和两万多名群众积极分子，除向居民解释市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法和实行这个办法的意义外，还介绍了节约粮食的经验和方法。
    新华社哈尔滨七日电　黑龙江省各市镇积极准备实行粮食定量供应制度。全省绝大部分市镇都在深入调查各类居民的粮食消费标准，划分工种，进一步宣传节约粮食的重大意义。哈尔滨市最近将举行一次广播大会，由市人民委员会负责人作有关节约粮食和实行定量供应的报告。市内各区正陆续举办粮食展览会，展览有些居民和机关浪费粮食的情况，并交流节约粮食的经验。现在全市居民差不多户户都订了用粮计划。全市一千一百多个集体伙食单位，都已改进了管理办法，为实行定量供应打下基础。
    从八月下半月起，省内佳木斯、鹤岗和嫩江等市、县先后实行了粮食定量供应制度。佳木斯市实行定量供应后，每人每月平均粮食消费量，比上半年节省了四斤六两。嫩江县实行定量供应后，比四月到七月每月平均粮食供应量减少九万八千斤。
    新华社上海七日电　上海市一万六千多户食品店铺和摊贩经营的十三种生、熟食品，从九月五日起实行定质、定价销售。统一的价格和质量标准，是由各有关行业同业公会和各区摊贩委员会讨论拟订并经政府批准的。
    现在各店铺、摊贩都张贴了这些食品的质量标准和价格表。这种作法大大减少了投机商贩降低食品质量的欺骗活动，很受顾客欢迎。
