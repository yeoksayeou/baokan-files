Guangdong Province has had over 500,000 senior elementary and junior high school graduates who did not continue their education and remained in the countryside from 1953 to the present. Among them, 220,000 have been assisted by local Party and government leading bodies and Communist Youth League organizations to participate in agricultural production and rural cultural work. The remaining 300,000 are also being gradually投入[thrown into] the production front and rural cultural positions.

For the past two years, senior elementary and junior high school graduates have played a significant role in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In Tongjing Township, Third District, Xinhui County, nearly 60 senior elementary and junior high school graduates who did not continue their education all participated in production, of whom 46 joined agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Huang Baolan, a senior elementary graduate, even became the deputy director of the First Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, which comprised more than 200 households. With their general knowledge and scientific common sense, senior elementary and junior high school graduates have achieved much in agricultural technology reform. Wang Zuofan, a technician at the Zhenzhai Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Fucheng Township, First District, Qiongdong County, Hainan, organized 15 graduated classmates and other educated youths in early 1954 to form a "Michurin Group" to experiment with rice hybridization. The first generation of hybridized rice had an average of 238 grains per ear, more than three times the average yield of the original variety.

Senior elementary and junior high school graduates have also been of great help to rural cultural work. Huang Baolan of the First Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Tongjing Township, Xinhui County, created a method of field literacy and a teaching method that combines on-site facts and objects to teach literacy, which does not hinder production and is loved by the masses. In Puning County, 48 townships held winter schools and established more than 140 farmers' literacy classes. Among the 283 mass teachers who undertook teaching work, senior elementary and junior high school graduates accounted for more than 90 percent.

Many senior elementary and junior high school graduates who have not participated in agricultural production have joined study groups, while also assisting the township people's governments in publicizing various central tasks and engaging in amateur cultural activities, which are also welcomed by farmers.

    广东未升学的高小初中毕业生在农村各项工作中很起作用
    广东省高小和初中毕业生，没有升学留在乡村的，从一九五三年到现在共有五十多万人，其中二十二万人已由各地党政领导机关和青年团组织协助，参加农业生产和农村文化工作，其余三十万人也正在陆续投入生产战线和农村文化阵地。
    两年来，高小、初中毕业生在农业生产和互助合作运动中起很大的作用。新会县第三区桐井乡没有升学的高小、初中毕业生近六十人，全部参加了生产，其中四十六人加入农业生产合作社和互助组，高小毕业生黄宝兰还当了二百多户的第一农业生产合作社的副主任。高小、初中毕业生们由于有了一般文化知识和科学常识，在农业技术改革上获得许多成就。海南琼东县第一区附城乡珍寨农业生产合作社技术员王祚樊，一九五四年初组织了十五个毕业同学和其他知识青年，成立了“米丘林小组”，试验水稻杂交，使杂交后的第一代水稻每穗平均二百三十八粒，比原品种每穗平均产量多了三倍。
    高小、初中毕业生们对于农村的文化工作也有很大的帮助。新会县桐井乡第一农业生产合作社黄宝兰创造的田间识字的办法和结合现场实事实物教识字的教学方法，既不妨碍生产，又为群众所喜爱。普宁县有四十八个乡举办了冬学，成立了一百四十多个农民识字班，在担任教学工作的二百八十三个群众教师中，高小和初中毕业生占百分之九十以上。
    高小、初中毕业生们未能参加农业生产的，很多参加了学习小组，同时帮助乡人民政府做各种中心任务的宣传工作，并搞业余的文化活动，也受到农民的欢迎。
