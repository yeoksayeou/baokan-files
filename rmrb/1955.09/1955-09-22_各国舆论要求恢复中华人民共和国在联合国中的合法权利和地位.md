International Public Opinion Demands the Restoration of the Legitimate Rights and Status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations
    Soviet "Pravda"
    "Pravda" published an article on the 18th by its Beijing correspondent, Domogatskikh, entitled "Asian People Demand Urgent International Issues Be Resolved in the 'Geneva Spirit'."
    The article pointed out that whether it is a public or political leader from Japan or India, Australia or Ceylon, Indonesia or Pakistan, whatever he has to say on foreign policy issues, he cannot but state his attitude towards China. It is quite clear that the international importance and international prestige of the People's Republic of China are very high.
    Public opinion in various countries has focused on the fact that the United States insists on refusing to recognize the People's Republic of China, prevents China from entering the United Nations, and uses its influence to hinder some countries from establishing close ties with China. At the same time, because it is necessary to discuss and resolve some issues involving the interests of both sides, representatives of the United States and the People's Republic of China have sat at the same conference table more than once.
    This obvious contradiction in U.S. foreign policy cannot but be noticed. On the contrary, sober-minded people cannot but draw the following conclusion: circumstances force the United States to negotiate with the new China and reluctantly accept a certain degree of normalization of relations with China. It is quite clear that Asian countries, which have been artificially cut off from traditional ties with China, cannot miss the favorable opportunity to restore such ties.
    Domogatskikh pointed out that the UN General Assembly is about to open, and therefore the public in Asian countries hopes that the General Assembly will consider some fundamental issues in Asia that are of great importance to maintaining and consolidating peace. The people of all countries hope that the member states of the United Nations will not ignore this abnormal situation: one of the major powers, a founding member of the United Nations, is deprived of its position in this organization. They believe that concrete steps must be taken without delay to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the UN General Assembly and the Security Council.
    Domogatskikh concluded that restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations is most in line with the "Geneva spirit."
    Korean "Rodong Sinmun"
    "Rodong Sinmun" published an article on the 16th demanding the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    The article said: China is one of the founding countries of the United Nations and also one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. However, great China is still illegally deprived of its legitimate seat in the United Nations. The reason for this intolerable situation is entirely due to the fact that certain groups in Western countries insist on adopting an unjust discriminatory policy towards the People's Republic of China, trampling on the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.
    The article continued: From the first day of its establishment, the People's Republic of China has always supported all the basic principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, and has always unswervingly pursued a peaceful policy in line with the principles and spirit of the Charter. This policy has made and is making a huge contribution to maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world and easing international tensions. All good people in the world strongly demand that, for the sake of peace and further easing international tensions, the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored as soon as possible.
    Indonesian "People's Daily"
    The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an article on the 20th urging countries participating in the Asian-African Conference to actively strive in the United Nations to restore China's legitimate status in the United Nations and expel the Chiang Kai-shek representatives.
    The article pointed out that the participation of the People's Republic of China in the Asian-African Conference made this conference a great success. Its participation in the discussion of the Indochina issue promoted the conclusion of a peace agreement. To quickly ease the current tensions, it is necessary to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and expel the Chiang Kai-shek representatives from this international organization. The United States' obstruction of the discussion of China's status in the United Nations is a violation of the spirit created by the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference.
    Australian and New Zealand Public Opinion
    The Australian weekly "Guardian" reported on the 15th that the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress held in Melbourne on the 9th voted overwhelmingly to demand the admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations.
    Australian House of Representatives member and representative of the locomotive drivers' union, E. Harrison, said at the meeting: The Congress must contribute to the solidarity of working people around the world against war. He emphasized the importance of supporting China's entry into the United Nations in this regard.
    "Guardian" also reported that a peace rally initiated by the Victorian Peace Council will be held at Melbourne Town Hall on September 21. "Guardian" pointed out that this meeting will be held on the same day as the United Nations General Assembly in New York. "Guardian" called on peace-loving people to participate in this peace rally so that the rally loudly demands that the government change its policy of opposing the restoration of the legitimate seat of China, which has a population of 600 million, in the United Nations.
      The New Zealand monthly "Peace" published an editorial in its September issue stating: "We must continue to demand that our government recognize China and urge the admission of China into the United Nations."
    Thai "Ping Thai Daily"
    The Thai "Ping Thai Daily" recently commented on the resolution passed by the 10th session of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, which closed in Bangkok on the 11th, which advocated letting the People's Republic of China enter the United Nations, saying: The passage of this resolution shows that the public will of the world is respected.
    "Ping Thai Daily" pointed out that activities demanding the admission of China into the United Nations are increasingly being carried out. Refusing this country, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, to enter the United Nations is tantamount to refusing to recognize the facts.
    "Ping Thai Daily" said: "The United Nations organization is a worldwide organization that does not distinguish between classes and political systems, and its purpose is to eliminate war and maintain world peace. At any time, if it refuses a country that accounts for a quarter of the world's population to enter this organization, then this organization can never achieve a satisfactory state."
    West German periodical "Voice of the Countryside"
    The West German church periodical "Voice of the Countryside" wrote in the first issue of its recently published September issue: "China must be given its legitimate status in the United Nations without delay." "China is a member of the United Nations, and if the United States does not recognize this, it is purely arbitrary."
    This periodical concluded: From whatever point of view, the issue of China's seat in the United Nations should be seen not only as a matter of justice, but also as a matter of world security. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 各国舆论要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利和地位

    各国舆论要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利和地位
    苏联“真理报”
    “真理报”十八日刊载了它的驻北京记者多莫加茨基赫的一篇文章，题目是“亚洲人民要求本着‘日内瓦精神’解决迫切的国际问题”。
    文章指出，不论是日本或印度的、澳大利亚或锡兰的、印度尼西亚或巴基斯坦的公众领袖或政治领袖，他在外交政策问题上有什么话要说，他都不能够不表明他对中国的态度。十分明显，人民中国在国际上的重要性和国际威望是非常高的。
    各国公众都集中注意这一事实：美国坚持不愿承认中华人民共和国，阻止中国进入联合国组织，并且运用它的影响来阻挠某些国家同中国建立密切的联系。同时，因为有必要讨论和解决牵涉到双方的利益的一些问题，因此美国代表和中华人民共和国的代表曾不止一次地坐在一张会议桌旁边。
    美国外交政策的这种显而易见的矛盾是不会不受到人们的注意的。相反地，头脑清醒的人们不能不得出如下的结论：环境迫使美国同新中国谈判，并且勉强接受了同中国的关系的某种程度的正常化。十分清楚的是人为地被切断了同中国的传统联系的亚洲各国不能错过恢复这种联系的有利机会。
    多莫加茨基赫指出，联合国大会常会即将开幕，因此亚洲各国公众希望联大将考虑对维护和巩固和平有极大重要性的亚洲的一些根本问题。各国人民希望联合国组织的各会员国不忽视这种不正常状态：大国之一、联合国的一个创始会员国被剥夺了它在这个组织中的地位。他们认为必须毫不迟延地采取具体步骤来恢复中华人民共和国在联合国大会和安全理事会的合法权利。
    多莫加茨基赫最后说，恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，是最符合“日内瓦精神”的。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    “劳动新闻”在十六日发表文章，要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。
    文章说：中国是建立联合国组织的发起国之一，也是安全理事会的五个常任理事国之一。但是，伟大的中国仍然被非法地剥夺了它在联合国中的合法席位。产生这种不能容忍的局势的原因完全是由于西方国家中的某些集团坚持对中华人民共和国采取不公正的歧视政策，践踏联合国宪章的基本原则。
  文章接着说：中华人民共和国从它成立的第一天起，就一直支持联合国宪章的全部基本原则和宗旨，并且始终不渝地奉行符合宪章的原则和精神的和平政策，这种政策已经并且正在对维护和巩固亚洲和世界的和平以及缓和国际紧张局势的事业作出巨大的贡献。全世界一切善良的人都强烈地要求：为了和平和进一步缓和国际紧张局势，应该尽早恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”二十日刊载一篇文章，敦促参加亚非会议的国家在联合国中为恢复中国在联合国的合法地位、驱逐蒋介石代表而积极努力。
    文章指出，中华人民共和国参加亚非会议使得这次会议获得巨大的成功。它参加讨论印度支那问题促进了达成和平协议。要迅速缓和目前紧张局势，就必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，把蒋介石代表从这个国际组织中驱逐出去。美国阻挠讨论中国在联合国的地位的问题，就是违背日内瓦四大国最高级会议所创造的精神。
    澳大利亚和新西兰的公众舆论
    澳大利亚周报“卫报”十五日报道，在墨尔本举行的澳大利亚工会理事会代表大会九日以压倒的多数表决要求接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国。
    澳大利亚众议院议员、机车司机工会的代表埃·哈里逊在会上说：代表大会必须对全世界劳动人民反对战争的团结作出贡献。他着重指出了支持中国进入联合国在这方面的重要意义。
    “卫报”还报道，由维多利亚州和平理事会发起的和平集会将于九月二十一日在墨尔本市政厅举行。“卫报”指出，这个会议和将在纽约召开的联合国大会在同一天开会。“卫报”号召爱好和平的人民参加这个和平集会，以使集会响亮地要求政府改变它的反对拥有六亿人口的中国恢复它在联合国的合法席位的政策。
      新西兰“和平”月刊九月号发表社论说：“我们必须继续要求我们的政府承认中国并且力促接纳中国进入联合国。”
    泰国“屏泰报”
    泰国“屏泰报”最近评论十一日在曼谷闭幕的联合国协会世界联合会第十届会议通过的主张让中华人民共和国进入联合国的决议说：这个决议的通过表明了全世界人民的公意受到了尊重。
    “屏泰报”指出，要求接纳中国进入联合国的活动正在日益开展，如果拒绝这一个占全世界人口四分之一的国家进入联合国，那就是不肯承认事实。
    “屏泰报”说：“联合国机构是全世界的不分阶级与政治制度的组织，其目的是为了排除战争和维护世界的和平。任何时候，如果它拒绝占全世界人口四分之一的国家进入这个机构，那末这个机构就绝对不能达到圆满的境地。”
    西德期刊“乡村之声”
    西德教会期刊“乡村之声”在最近出版的九月份的第一期中写道：“必须毫不迟延地把中国在联合国中的合法地位给予中国。”“中国是联合国的成员，如果美国不承认这一点，那就是纯粹的专横。”
    这家期刊在结语中说：无论从哪个角度来看，关于中国在联合国中的席位的问题都应当被看作不仅是关系到正义的事情，而且是关系到全世界安全的事情。（据新华社讯）
