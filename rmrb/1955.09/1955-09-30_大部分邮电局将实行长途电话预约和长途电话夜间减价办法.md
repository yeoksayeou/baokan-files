Most post offices across the country will implement long-distance telephone reservation and nighttime discount measures starting October 1, according to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. For long-distance calls between large and medium-sized cities and some small cities nationwide, government agencies, enterprises, and organizations can apply for reservations with the local post office. The call date and time for reserved calls will be agreed upon by the calling user and the post office and incorporated into a contract. The long-distance telephone nighttime discount measure can be implemented between post offices in cities at the county level and above nationwide. The specified discount hours are from 0:00 to 7:00 daily. With the exception of military and government telephones in the Northeast region, which already have a 50% discount, all long-distance telephone rates will be charged at half the original listed price for all types of long-distance calls.

The implementation of these two measures will improve the uneven distribution of long-distance telephone traffic, balance circuit load, speed up telephone connection times, and enable government agencies to save on telephone expenses.

    大部分邮电局将实行长途电话预约和长途电话夜间减价办法
    根据邮电部的规定，全国大部分邮电局自十月一日起实行长途电话预约办法和长途电话夜间减价办法。凡在全国大、中城市和部分小城市间通话的长途电话，机关、企业、团体都可以向当地邮电局申请预约。预约电话的通话日期和时间，由发话用户和邮电局双方洽商取得协议后订入合同。长途电话夜间减价办法，在全国县以上城市的邮电局间都可以实行。规定的减价时间为每日零时到七时。话价除东北地区军政电话过去已减半计费不再折减外，一律按各类长途电话原订价目减半收费。
    这两个办法实行后，将可改善长途电话忙闲不均的情况，平均电路负荷，加快电话接通时间，也使各机关能节约一部分电话费。
