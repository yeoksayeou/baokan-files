Heilongjiang Youth Exchange Experiences in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

How to better conserve industrial raw materials and increase production and save grain was an important topic at the recent Heilongjiang Province Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress.

This important topic was raised by the youth blanking team of the Second Workshop of Harbin 464 Factory and agricultural production cooperatives in Hailun and other counties. Since the beginning of this year, the workers of the youth blanking team of the Second Workshop of Harbin 464 Factory have saved the country 15.5 tons of steel, increasing the utilization rate of each ton of steel from 70% to 85%.

Li Shou'an, a worker of this team, told the conference that from September to December, while ensuring the quality of work and completing the national production plan ahead of schedule, they would save the country another 24 tons of steel. Last year, the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Renhe Village in Hailun County organized the young men and women in the cooperative to strip 8,750 jin of barnyard grass seeds to replace grain as feed, resulting in a saving of 7,875 jin of grain. Sun Xianzhong, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, used his own experience to give the youth activists present an account, saying: If all the young people and children in the province pick 50 jin of grain each during the autumn harvest, and the young people in the province, together with middle-aged and old people, strive to harvest an extra 50 jin of grain per hectare in the autumn harvest cutting, pulling, and threshing processes, the province can increase grain production by 200,000 tons in just one autumn harvest.

The industrial and agricultural youth activists who attended the conference all expressed that they would better conserve industrial raw materials and increase production and save grain in the future. Li Zhiliang, the captain of the "Steel Warrior" Youth Shock Team in Qiqihar City, said: Our shock team has saved the country 52 tons of steel in the past four months. We will further rationally utilize raw materials and ensure that we save the country another 40 tons of steel by the end of the year. Yang Shengchun, a youth activist from an agricultural production cooperative in Qing'an County, said: It is entirely possible for each young person and child to pick 50 jin of grain during the autumn harvest. After I go back, I will definitely mobilize the youth and children of the entire cooperative to conduct a friendly competition in picking grain with the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Renhe Village.

### 黑龙江青年交流增产节约经验

    黑龙江青年交流增产节约经验
    如何更好地节约工业原材料和增产节约粮食，是黑龙江省最近举行的青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上一项重要的议题。
    这项重要议题是由哈尔滨四六四厂第二工段青年下料小组和海伦等县的农业生产合作社提出的。哈尔滨四六四厂第二工段青年下料小组的工人，今年年初以来已经给国家节省了十五吨半钢材，使每吨钢材的利用率由百分之七十提高到百分之八十五。
    这个小组工人李守安向大会表示：他们从九月到十二月，在保证工作质量、提前完成国家生产计划的基础上，还要再给国家节约二十四吨钢材。海伦县人和村第一农业生产合作社去年组织社里的男女青年，捋了八千七百五十斤稗子草的草籽代替粮食作饲料，结果节省了七千八百七十五斤粮食。农业生产合作社的主任孙显忠，用他们本身的经验向到会的青年积极分子算了一笔账，他说：全省青年和少年每人在秋收中都拣五十斤粮食，全省青年在秋收的割、拉、打等过程中，和中年人、老年人一起再争取每公顷多收五十斤粮食，这样，全省仅在一季秋收中就能给国家增产二十万吨粮食。
    参加大会的工农业青年积极分子都表示今后要更好地节约工业原材料和增产节约粮食。齐齐哈尔市的“钢铁战士”青年突击队队长李志良说：我们突击队在过去四个月中已经为国家节约了五十二吨钢材，我们要进一步合理运用原材料，保证到年底再为国家节约四十吨钢材。来自庆安县的一个农业生产合作社的青年积极分子杨胜春说：每个青年和少年在秋收中完全有可能拣五十斤粮食。我回去后一定动员全合作社的青年和少年，和人和村第一农业生产合作社进行拣粮的友谊比赛。
