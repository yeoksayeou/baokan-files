    Achievements of the Soviet-Yugoslav Economic Talks
    The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia issued a joint communiqué on their economic talks on September 2. The communiqué indicated that, based on the desire to develop economic relations between the two countries, both sides reached an agreement on further developing economic cooperation; at the same time, corresponding agreements were reached on trade, the conclusion of a long-term goods delivery agreement, and financial and credit issues. The positive outcome of the Soviet-Yugoslav economic talks is an important achievement in developing friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. It is not only conducive to the economic development of both countries but also helps to strengthen international economic cooperation.
    The Soviet-Yugoslav government talks held in May and June of this year improved relations between the two countries based on the principles of respect for territorial sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit. After the government talks, the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the two countries was further developed. The Yugoslav National Assembly delegation and the Yugoslav "Kolo" folk dance troupe successively visited the Soviet Union and received warm and cordial welcomes from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. Comrade Tito, President of Yugoslavia, has also accepted an invitation to visit the Soviet Union. In his speech on July 27, Comrade Tito pointed out, when talking about Soviet-Yugoslav relations, that the Soviet Union, understanding Yugoslavia's economic difficulties, had written off Yugoslavia's debt to the Soviet Union of more than 90 million US dollars. Now, the Soviet-Yugoslav economic talks have strengthened and expanded economic cooperation between the two countries. The comprehensive cooperative relationship between the two countries is making continuous progress.
    The Soviet-Yugoslav economic talks reached so many agreements in such a short period, which fully demonstrates the spirit of mutual understanding and promotion of common economic interests between the two sides. This kind of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is a good example of international economic cooperation.
    The expansion and consolidation of Soviet-Yugoslav economic cooperation not only conform to the interests of the people of both countries but also conform to the interests of strengthening the entire socialist cause. People who love peace and strive for the cause of socialism warmly welcome the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav economic talks because it is an important step forward in the cause of international cooperation.

    苏南经济会谈的成就
    苏联和南斯拉夫于九月二日发表了双方的经济会谈公报。会谈公报表明，双方本着发展两国间的经济关系的愿望，就进一步发展经济合作问题达成了协议；同时还就有关贸易，缔结一个长期货物交付协定以及财政和信贷问题，达成了相应的协议。苏南经济会谈的良好结果，是发展苏联和南斯拉夫之间的友好关系的重要成就。它不但有利于两国的经济发展，并且有助于加强国际经济合作。
    今年五、六月间举行的苏南两国政府的会谈，根据尊重领土主权和平等互利的原则，改善了两国之间的关系。在两国政府会谈之后，两国人民的兄弟友谊得到了进一步的发展。南斯拉夫国民议会代表团和南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团先后访问了苏联，受到了苏联最高苏维埃和苏联人民热烈的、亲切的欢迎。南斯拉夫总统铁托同志也已接受了访问苏联的邀请。铁托同志在七月二十七日发表的演说中，在谈到苏南关系时还指出，由于苏联了解到南斯拉夫的经济困难，因而勾销了南斯拉夫欠苏联的为数九千万美元以上的债款。现在，苏南经济会谈又加强和扩大了两国的经济合作。两国之间的全面合作关系正在取得不断的进展。
    苏南经济会谈在短短的期间内达成了这样多的协议，这充分表现了双方相互谅解和促进共同经济利益的精神。苏南两国这种在平等互利基础上的经济合作关系，是国际经济合作的一个良好范例。
    苏南经济合作的扩大和巩固，不但符合于两国人民的利益，而且也符合于加强整个社会主义事业的利益。爱好和平和努力于社会主义事业的人民热忱欢迎苏南经济会谈的结果，因为它是国际合作事业的一个重要进展。
