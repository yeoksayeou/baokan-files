Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 17th. During the Indian Parliament's People's Assembly foreign policy debate, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in his opening remarks, stated that the recent agreement between the United States and China on civilian issues had not gone very far, and major issues related to China continue to exist. "The entire Far East problem continues to exist. The future of Korea remains one of the unresolved issues. The Taiwan issue, or even the issue of the small islands of Jinmen and Matsu—which people have long agreed should belong to the mainland—continues to exist."

Nehru said that China has asked India to take responsibility for taking care of Chinese people in the United States. In this situation, we must agree, and we have indicated to both China and the United States that, if necessary, we will endeavor to take on this responsibility.

The Indian Prime Minister said that although the recent agreement between the Soviet Union and West Germany did not go very far, it has moved the German issue from a potentially conflicting area to the conference table. "This in itself is a huge gain."

Regarding the current international situation, Nehru pointed out that the situation has greatly improved in the last six months. He said, "For the first time, people around the world have felt a sense of relief, and for the first time, they feel that war is not inevitable. I don't think it's wrong to say that. In fact, war is very avoidable."

Nehru said: "People in all countries have increasingly hoped to adopt peaceful methods and have distanced themselves from those who are single-mindedly thinking about war."

Reviewing the Bandung Conference, Nehru said: "Everyone knows that it was not only a major event in Asian history, but also a major event in world affairs, and I think it has led to many other events." He believes that the Asian-African Conference is "an important model of people seeking a common basis for peaceful coexistence despite differences."

Nehru expressed the hope that efforts to seek solutions to the problems of Morocco and Algeria will yield results, and hopes that "a way to liberate these countries can be found soon."

Nehru called South Africa "a brazen defender of racism." He said that what is happening there not only violates the United Nations Charter, but is also something that all mankind cannot but consider appalling.

Nehru said that Portugal's continued rule in Goa is "an insult to civilized humanity." He said that Goa is not only a symbol of decadent colonialism, but has become "a touchstone by which we can judge the policies of other countries."

Nehru stated that the Indian government hopes to resolve the Goa issue peacefully and will continue to ban peaceful resistance movements.

Answering questions in the People's Assembly, Nehru said that India does not approve of raising the issue of amending the United Nations Charter at this time. He also said that India is happy to allow all countries that meet the conditions of the Charter to join the United Nations.

    在印度国会人民院外交政策辩论中
    尼赫鲁总理谈中美关系等问题
    新华社新德里十七日电  印度总理尼赫鲁在印度国会人民院外交政策辩论中首先发言说，最近美国和中国在平民问题上的协议并没有走得很远，和中国有关的重大问题仍继续存在。“整个远东问题仍继续存在。朝鲜的前途仍然是未决问题之一。台湾问题，或者甚至是金门和马祖那些小岛问题——很久以来人们一直一致认为它们应归大陆——仍继续存在。”
    尼赫鲁说，中国已经要求印度负起照顾在美国的中国人的责任。在这种情况下，我们必须同意，而且我们已经向中国和美国表明，如果必须的话，我们将努力担负起这个责任。
    印度总理说，最近苏联和西德的协议虽然走得不太远，但是它已把德国问题从一个可能引起冲突的领域中搬到会议桌上来了。“这本身就是一个巨大的收获”。
    关于目前的国际局势，尼赫鲁指出：六个月以来局势已经大大改善。他说，“世界各地人民第一次有了松一口气的感觉，第一次感到战争不是不可避免的。我认为这样说是不会错的。实际上，战争是很可以避免的。”
    尼赫鲁说：“各国人民已经愈来愈多地盼望采取和平方法，并且疏远了那些一心想着战争的人。”
    尼赫鲁在回顾万隆会议时说：“人人都知道，那不但是亚洲历史上的一件大事，而且也是世界事务中的一件大事，而且我认为它导向许多其他的事件。”他认为亚非会议是“人们不顾分歧寻找和平共处的共同基础的重要典范。”
    尼赫鲁表示希望谋求解决摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚问题的努力将产生结果，并希望“很快就能找到使这些国家获得自由的办法”。
    尼赫鲁把南非称为是“种族主义的厚脸皮的护卫者”。他说，那里所发生的事情不但违背联合国宪章，而且是全体人类都不能不认为是很恶劣的事情。
    尼赫鲁说，葡萄牙的继续统治果阿是“对文明人类的侮辱”。他说果阿不仅是没落的殖民主义的象征，而且已经变成“一种我们可以由此判断其他国家政策的试金石”。
    尼赫鲁表示，印度政府希望和平解决果阿问题，并且将继续禁止和平抵抗运动。
    尼赫鲁在人民院回答问题时说，印度不赞成在目前提出修改联合国宪章的问题。他又说，印度乐于让所有符合宪章条件的国家都加入联合国。
