To the Editor:

We are staff members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau. We have found that the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture's seed allocation work in the first half of this year was very chaotic, causing huge losses to the country and affecting agricultural production.

Because the Department of Agriculture had no idea about the seed stock situation in various regions, many unreasonable transportation phenomena occurred. For example, on April 6th, the Department of Agriculture proposed transferring 50 tons of rice seeds from Hailin County to Muling County; after the Grain Bureau transferred them, Hailin lacked rice seeds again and had to transfer in 45 tons from Acheng County. Also, in April, according to the spring plowing seed allocation plan of the Department of Agriculture, the Grain Bureau transferred 130 tons of rice seeds from Longjiang County to Nehe County; who knew that Nehe County had a large stock of rice seeds and refused to receive them, so this batch of seeds had to be transported back to Qiqihar for rice processing.

The phenomenon of changing the allocation plan "morning order, evening change" is also very serious. For example, on May 30th, the Department of Agriculture proposed a plan to the Grain Bureau to transfer 98 tons of rice seeds from Heli to Mishan County and 84 tons of rice seeds to Yong'an; later, the Department of Agriculture said that Heli had no rice seeds, and on June 9th, it quickly notified the cancellation of the original plan, and changed to transferring 100 tons of rice seeds from Xianglan to Mishan County. After the Grain Bureau submitted the transportation plan to the railway, the Department of Agriculture notified that it should be changed to 60 tons to Heitai and 40 tons to Mishan. Who knew that on June 13th, the Department of Agriculture found that Heli still had rice seeds, so it sent another urgent notice to retrieve 100 tons of rice seeds from Heli to Mishan County and 50 tons of rice seeds to Yong'an.

The Department of Agriculture also casually put forward some allocation plans that were not needed at all. For example, on June 13th, the Department of Agriculture proposed a plan to the Grain Bureau: Tailai County needs to transfer a total of 80 tons of seeds of several late-field early-maturing crops from other places. At that time, the Grain Bureau found that Tailai County's grain depot had seeds in stock, so it contacted the Department of Agriculture. The comrades of the Agricultural Policy Section of the Department of Agriculture insisted that there would be "no mistake" in this plan. In fact, the grain bureau of Tailai County not only had enough seeds in stock, but also had a surplus.

It should also be mentioned that the issue of exchanging corn seeds between our province and Jilin Province this spring. At that time, in order to grow more high-yield crops, our province decided to exchange 1,000 tons of corn seeds with Jilin. After exchanging 410 tons, because the weather was getting warmer and the corn was not easy to store, Jilin asked our province to quickly decide whether to continue the transfer. Because the Department of Agriculture in our province was unsure, it told us to notify the Jilin Provincial Grain Bureau to treat the remaining corn seeds as commercial grain. Later, six counties in our province, including Ning'an, Mishan, and Hailin, needed corn seeds, but because it was too late, they had to give up planting, which affected production.

Based on the above situation, we feel that the Department of Agriculture should learn from the lessons and improve its work when organizing the allocation of late-field seeds. Therefore, on June 16th, we called the office of the Department of Agriculture to express our opinions. Who knew that the comrade in charge of the office did not finish listening to our opinions, and said that in the context of the small-scale peasant economy, this phenomenon was "inevitable" and "insurmountable"; instead, he criticized us for "being afraid of trouble."

After considering the opinions of the comrade in charge of the office of the Department of Agriculture, we believe that this statement is wrong. The chaotic phenomena in the seed allocation work in our province in the first half of the year cannot be blamed on the "small-scale peasant economy" in most cases, but on the fact that the Department of Agriculture failed to conduct in-depth investigations and grasp accurate information when formulating the allocation plan. Using objective difficulties as an excuse to regard the shortcomings in one's work as "inevitable" and "insurmountable" can only hinder oneself from improving one's work. It is hoped that the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee will order the Department of Agriculture to examine and improve the seed allocation work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

### 黑龙江农业厅应该改进种籽调拨工作

    黑龙江农业厅应该改进种籽调拨工作编辑同志：
    我们是黑龙江省粮食厅的工作人员。我们发现黑龙江省农业厅，在今年上半年的种籽调拨工作中混乱现象很严重，给国家造成了巨大损失，并且影响了农业生产。
    由于农业厅对各地种籽存缺情况心中无数，造成了很多不合理运输的现象。如四月六日，农业厅提出要从海林县调给穆棱县水稻种籽五十吨；粮食厅调运以后，海林又缺少稻种了，只好又从阿城县调进四十五吨。又如，四月份粮食厅根据农业厅的春耕种籽调拨计划，从龙江县调一百三十吨稻种给讷河县；谁知道讷河县库存的稻种很多，拒绝接收，这批种籽只好运回齐齐哈尔加工稻米。
    调运计划“朝令夕改”的现象也很严重。如五月三十日农业厅向粮食厅提出从鹤立调给密山县稻种九十八吨、调给永安稻种八十四吨的计划，后来农业厅说是鹤立没有稻种，六月九日赶紧通知取消原计划，改为从香兰调给密山县一百吨稻种。粮食厅向铁路提出运输计划后，农业厅又通知要改为发黑台六十吨、密山四十吨。谁知到六月十三日，农业厅又发现鹤立还有水稻种籽，于是再用急件通知要由鹤立追调给密山县稻种一百吨，永安稻种五十吨。
    农业厅还曾随便提出一些根本不需要的调拨计划。如六月十三日农业厅向粮食厅提出计划：泰来县需要从外地调入几种晚田早熟作物的种籽共八十吨。当时粮食厅发现泰来县粮库存有种籽，就同农业厅联系。农业厅农政科的同志却坚持说这个计划“不会有什么差错”。而实际上，泰来县粮食局库存种籽不但够用，而且还有余。
    还应该举出今春我省和吉林省串换苞米种籽的问题。当时我省为了多种高产作物，决定向吉林串换一千吨苞米种籽。在串换了四百一十吨以后，因为天气渐暖，苞米不好保管，吉林要求我省迅速决定是否继续调运。由于我省农业厅心中没底，就告诉我们通知吉林省粮食厅把其余的苞米种籽当商品粮处理了。后来，我省宁安、密山、海林等六个县又需要苞米种籽，因为时间过迟，结果只好不种，影响了生产。
    根据以上情况，我们觉得农业厅在组织调拨晚田种籽时应该吸取教训，改进工作。因此，六月十六日，我们就打电话向农业厅办公室提出意见。谁知道办公室负责同志没听完我们的意见，就说在小农经济的情况下，这种现象是“不可避免”和“无法克服”的；反而批评我们“怕麻烦”。
    我们考虑了农业厅办公室负责同志的意见后，认为这种说法是错误的。我省上半年种籽调拨工作中的混乱现象，绝大部分不能归罪于“小农经济”，而要怪农业厅制定调拨计划时没有能够深入地进行调查，掌握准确的情况。借口客观困难而把自己工作中的缺点看成“不可避免”和“无法克服”，这只能妨碍自己改进工作。希望黑龙江省人民委员会责成农业厅本着批评和自我批评的精神，检查和改进种籽调拨工作。
