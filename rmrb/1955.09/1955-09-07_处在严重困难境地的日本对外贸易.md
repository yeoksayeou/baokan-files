    Japan's Foreign Trade in Serious Difficulties
    Pei Da
    Japan is an industrially developed country, but it lacks natural resources and has a small domestic market, making its economy dependent on the normal development of foreign trade. Its major industrial sectors, such as metallurgy, textiles, and chemicals, all need to import raw materials; and manufactured goods must be exported to foreign markets for sale as payment for imports. Therefore, Japan must maintain a balance between exports and imports and adapt them to its production level. Otherwise, its foreign trade will suffer from an import surplus, which will lead to a decline in production and an economic crisis.
    Currently, the Japanese economy is facing such a problem, that is, its export trade is far behind the growth of industrial production. In 1954, Japan's industrial production increased by 65.5 percent compared with the pre-war period, but its export trade only recovered to 46.3 percent of the pre-war level. This situation has caused a serious imbalance in Japan's import and export. In the four years from 1951 to 1954, Japan's foreign trade deficit reached 3,265.4 million US dollars. In the first half of this year, although the Japanese government continued to implement a policy of tightening imports and expanding exports, the deficit still reached more than 330 million US dollars.
    The failure of exports to keep up with the growth of production has already caused the production of some Japanese industries to begin to shrink. In 1954, the production of Japanese machinery and equipment decreased by 3.5 percent compared with 1953, and in June of the same year, the production of rubber products industry decreased by 23.6 percent compared with the highest level. This year, Japanese cotton yarn production began to cut production by 12 percent in May, and continues to decline. Simultaneously with the reduction of production, the inventory of Japanese enterprise commodities has been continuously increasing. The inventory at the end of June 1954 increased by 88 percent compared with 1950. In this way, the number of bankrupt Japanese companies and unemployed workers has also increased accordingly. In 1954 alone, 649 textile companies went bankrupt, more than double the number in 1953. According to official figures, the number of unemployed people in Japan in the first six months of this year increased by 40 percent compared with the same period last year.
    The abnormal development of Japan's foreign trade and the failure of export trade to keep up with the growth of production are mainly due to the Japanese government's abandonment of an independent and autonomous foreign policy and its political and economic dependence on the United States. In order to rearm Japan, the United States has tried its best to support Japan's military industry, causing the Japanese economy to embark on a path of one-sided development. The Japanese military industry, which had already expanded before the war, accounted for 38 percent of the total national industrial production, while in 1951 it accounted for 45 percent. This has left some export industrial sectors in a state of neglect and depression, such as the production of the textile industry, which has not even reached the pre-war level. In terms of foreign trade, the United States has monopolized Japan's imports, causing American goods to flood the Japanese market, but it has tried every means to prevent Japanese goods from being sold in the American market. From 1951 to 1953, the proportion of the United States in Japan's total imports was around 40 percent, but it only accounted for about 20 percent of Japan's total exports. Foreign trade statistics for 1954 released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance show that Japan's exports to the dollar area increased by only 6.5 percent compared with 1953, while imports from the dollar area increased by 25 percent. Most of the so-called imports from the dollar area are imports from the United States. Because the United States monopolizes Japan's imports, Japanese importers have to buy American raw materials and foodstuffs at high prices. This increases Japan's production costs and increases the difficulty of Japanese goods in foreign sales.
    At the same time, due to Japan's implementation of the US "embargo" policy, it has damaged Japan's traditional foreign trade relations, causing Japan's trade with peaceful and democratic countries, especially with China, to be severely hindered. For example, in 1952 and 1953, the two trade agreements signed between Japan and China were not fully implemented, because Japan could not export the goods needed by China. In this way, the scope of Japan's foreign trade has been greatly reduced.
    Under such circumstances, Japan had planned to greatly increase its exports to the United States, but facts have proved that this path is not feasible. Japan's exports to the United States have always been hindered by US tariff barriers. The Japan Tariff Association issued a statement in March this year saying: almost all the goods exported by the United States to Japan are tax-free, while the United States imposes import taxes on Japanese goods equivalent to 30 to 70 percent of the price of the goods. Shozo Murata, chairman of the Japan Tariff Association, wrote in a letter to the editor of the "New York Times": "Before there are any signs of increased exports of certain Japanese commodities, the United States has issued calls for increased tax rates to stop the activities of those particular commodities." According to reports, American industrialists are now working hard to prevent cheap Japanese cotton cloth, sewing machines, porcelain and glass and other goods from entering the United States. In addition, the United States also prohibits the import of certain Japanese goods under the pretext of "flammable silk fabrics" and "Chinese raw materials." US Secretary of State Dulles publicly told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 5 that he hoped that Japan "would not ship goods here (the United States), because there is no need for their goods here." Japanese trade officials also admit that it is more difficult for Japan to increase exports to the United States than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.
    In recent years, Japan has tried to expand its export trade to the sterling area, but it has also encountered increasing difficulties. In the Anglo-Japanese trade negotiations this year, the British unwillingness for Japan to increase exports to the sterling area was very clear. Japan requested that the new agreement should stipulate that the import and export of both parties should be 220 million pounds each year; but the United Kingdom insisted that the new agreement should stipulate that Japan should import 275 million pounds from the sterling area, while the sterling area should only import 260 million pounds from Japan. This would obviously cause Japan's trade with the sterling area to have an import surplus. In this way, the Anglo-Japanese trade negotiations had to be declared interrupted. According to reports, the United Kingdom has recently announced that it is prepared to impose anti-dumping duties on Japanese goods, which will have a more unfavorable impact on Japan's export trade.
    In addition, due to the increase in the quantity of Japanese cotton cloth exports, countries such as the Netherlands and West Germany, which have been hit, have also begun to restrict the import of Japanese goods. According to Kyodo News, if Japan does not automatically guarantee to restrict its cotton cloth exports, these countries will not have relations with Japan under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    The above situation shows that Japan's foreign trade is under the intervention of the United States, and it is very difficult to develop trade in the greatly reduced capitalist world market. Therefore, Japan urgently needs to break free from the restrictions of the United States, develop free trade, especially to expand trade exchanges with peaceful and democratic camp countries. Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun" once emphasized: "If we cannot develop free trade with countries all over the world, then Japan's economic situation will be difficult to maintain. Japan can only achieve economic stability under the conditions of expanding trade." The desire of Japanese business and social figures to develop free trade is understandable. China is willing to expand trade relations with Japan, and has made many efforts to promote trade between China and Japan. Recently, Lei Renmin, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, pointed out at the Beijing People's Congress against Atomic War and against the Use of Atomic Weapons: "As long as the Japanese government takes concrete and effective measures to give practical support to the new trade agreement, remove artificial obstacles and restrictions, it can improve Sino-Japanese trade relations and expand Sino-Japanese trade." This is obviously beneficial to Japan's improvement of its current difficult position in foreign trade.

    处在严重困难境地的日本对外贸易
    裴达
    日本是个工业发达的国家，但是它缺乏自然资源，国内市场狭小，经济上须仰赖对外贸易的正常发展。它的主要工业部门如冶金、纺织、化学等工业都要进口原料；而工业制成品则须输出到国外市场销售，作为进口的支付。因此，日本必须使输出同进口保持平衡，并与生产水平相适应。否则，它的对外贸易就要发生入超，就会引起生产下降，经济发生危机。
    目前，日本的经济正面临着这样一个问题，就是它的出口贸易远远落后于工业生产的增长。在一九五四年，日本工业生产比战前增加了百分之六十五点五，但它的出口贸易只恢复到战前的百分之四十六点三。这种情况，使日本的进出口发生了严重的不平衡。在一九五一年到一九五四年的四年中，日本对外贸易的逆差已达到三十二亿六千五百四十万美元。今年上半年，日本政府虽然继续实行了紧缩进口，扩大出口的政策，但是逆差仍达三亿三千多万美元。
    输出赶不上生产的增长，已使日本某些工业的生产开始萎缩。一九五四年日本机器装备的生产比一九五三年减少了百分之三点五，同年六月橡胶制品工业的生产比最高水平下降了二十三点六。今年，日本棉纱生产从五月开始减产百分之十二，并且还在继续下降。与生产缩减的同时，日本企业商品存货量却不断增加。一九五四年六月底的存货量比一九五○年增加了百分之八十八。这样，日本企业倒闭数量和失业工人数量也就随着增加了。在一九五四年，仅纺织公司就倒闭了六百四十九家，比一九五三年多了一倍以上。据官方公布，今年头六个月日本的失业人口，比去年同期增加了百分之四十。
    日本对外贸易不能正常发展，出口贸易赶不上生产的增长，基本原因是由于日本政府放弃了独立自主的对外政策，在政治、经济上依附美国的结果。美国为重新武装日本，竭力扶植日本的军事工业，使日本经济走上片面发展的道路。战前业已膨胀了的日本军事工业占全国工业生产总量的百分之三十八，而在一九五一年却占到百分之四十五。这就使日本某些出口工业部门处于冷落萧条的境地，如纺织工业的生产甚至没有达到战前的水平。在对外贸易方面，美国垄断了日本的进口，使美国货充斥日本市场，但是它却千方百计地阻止日本商品在美国市场销售。一九五一年到一九五三年，美国在日本进口总额中的比重都在百分之四十左右，但在日本出口总额中则只占百分之二十左右。日本大藏省发表的一九五四年对外贸易统计数字表明，日本对美元区出口只比一九五三年增加百分之六点五，而从美元区进口却增加了百分之二十五。所谓美元区的进口，绝大部分就是从美国进口的。由于美国垄断了日本的进口，日本进口商就不得不以高昂的价钱去购买美国的原料和食用品。这就使得日本生产成本增高，增加了日本货物在外销上的困难。
    同时，由于日本执行美国的“禁运”政策，破坏了日本传统的对外贸易联系，使日本对和平民主国家特别是对中国的贸易受到了严重的阻碍。如在一九五二年和一九五三年，日本同中国签订的两次贸易协定都没有能够完全执行，其原因就是日本不能输出为中国所需要的商品。这样，日本对外贸易的范围就大大缩小了。
    在这种情况下，日本曾打算大大增加对美国的出口，但事实证明，这条道路是行不通的。日本对美国的出口一直遭受美国关税壁垒的阻挠。日本关税协会在今年三月间发表声明说：美国对日本出口的货物几乎全是免税，而美国对于日本的货物却课以相当于货价百分之三十到七十的进口税。日本关税协会会长村田省藏在给“纽约时报”主笔的一封信上写道：“在日本某些商品还没有增加输出的迹象之前，美国已经发出要求增加税率以制止那些特别的商品的活动的呼声。”据报道，目前美国工业家正在努力不让日本的廉价棉布、缝纫机、瓷器和玻璃等货物输入美国。此外，美国还借口“丝织品易燃”、“中国原料”等为理由禁止日本某些货物的进口。美国国务卿杜勒斯五月五日公开对美国参议院外交委员会说，他希望日本“不要把货物运来这里（美国），因为这里不需要它们的货物”。日本贸易界人士也承认，日本对美国增加出口，比骆驼穿过针眼还要困难。
    几年来，日本曾力图对英镑区扩大出口贸易，但是也遭到越来越多的困难。在今年日英贸易谈判中，英国不愿意日本对英镑区增加输出的情绪，就表现得非常清楚。日本要求新协定应规定双方一年间进出口各为两亿二千万英镑；但是英国却坚持要新协定规定：日本从英镑区进口二亿七千五百万英镑，而英镑区只从日本进口二亿六千万镑。这显然会使日本对英镑区的贸易入超。这样，日英贸易谈判不得不宣告中断。据报道，英国最近已经宣布，它准备对日本货物征收反倾销税，这对日本出口贸易将发生更不利的影响。
    此外，由于日本棉布出口数量的增加，受到打击的荷兰、西德等国家也开始限制日本货物进口。据共同社报道，如果日本不自动地保证限制自己的棉布出口，这些国家将不同日本发生关税及贸易总协定的关系。
    以上情况表明，日本的对外贸易在美国干涉之下，它要在大大缩小了的资本主义世界市场上发展贸易是十分不容易的。因此，日本就迫切需要挣脱美国的限制，发展自由贸易，特别是与和平民主阵营各国扩大贸易往来。日本“读卖新闻”就曾强调指出：“如果我们不能与世界各国发展自由贸易，那末，日本经济情况很难维持下去。日本只有在扩展贸易的条件下，才能获得经济的稳定。”日本工商业界和社会人士对发展自由贸易的愿望是可以理解的。中国是愿意同日本扩大贸易关系的，并且为促进中日两国之间的贸易作了不少的努力。最近中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民在北京各界反对原子战争与反对使用原子武器大会上就曾指出：“只要日本政府采取具体有效的措施，对新的贸易协定给予实际的支持，撤除人为的障碍和限制，就可以改善中日贸易关系，并扩大中日贸易。”这对于日本改善它目前对外贸易的困难地位，显然是有利的。
