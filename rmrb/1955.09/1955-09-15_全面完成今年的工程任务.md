Efforts to Fulfill and Overfulfill the 1955 Plan

    Comprehensively Fulfill This Year's Engineering Tasks
    By Liu Xiufeng, Minister of Building Engineering

    Since the Ministry of Building Engineering's design and construction work conference in February of this year, there have been positive changes in both design and construction work. This transformation has created conditions for striving to comprehensively fulfill this year's engineering tasks. After studying the documents from the All-Soviet Union Construction Workers Conference and the Ministry of Building Engineering's design and construction work conference, designers have further understood the correct architectural principle of "applicable, economical, and aesthetically pleasing where possible," which the Party Central Committee proposed long ago. They have raised their design thinking, criticized the bourgeois formalism and revivalist tendencies that neglect economy and practicality, and examined and revised some unreasonable designs. Now, the extravagant "big roof" style designs have been stopped, and the high-standard "boxes" have been broken. According to preliminary estimates, the Ministry of Building Engineering's civil building designs, after modification or redesign, can save the country tens of millions of yuan this year.
    In terms of construction, many construction units have paid attention to compiling annual construction financial plans, construction organization operation designs (referred to as construction designs), and signing contracts and agreements. The phenomenon of rushing into construction without studying construction rules, violating basic construction procedures, and blindly preparing, which has often occurred in recent years, has begun to change. The phenomenon of materials being moved after construction starts due to improper site layout, demolition of temporary facilities, and power outages due to water shortages has also been reduced. Many construction units have launched movements to practice strict economy and oppose waste. In the movement, units where leaders took the lead, mobilized the masses, exposed waste, analyzed the reasons, and improved work to establish systems have achieved good results. The Second Company of Northeast China exposed 5,505 cases of waste, worth a total of 2.6 million yuan. The vast number of employees put forward 589 rationalization proposals in the movement, and the 367 that have already been implemented by the Second Engineering Office alone can save more than 300,000 yuan. The material management work of many units has been improved. They have paid attention to purchasing according to plan, investigating sources of goods, comparing quality, comparing prices, comparing transportation distances, and paying attention to the use of old materials, waste materials, and substitutes. The First Company of Northeast China used substandard materials, residual materials, and old materials to save 7,000 cubic meters of raw wood. The Northwest Engineering Management Bureau, following the suggestions of Soviet experts, replaced crushed stone mined about 100 kilometers away with pebbles from the Chan River near the construction site, which can save 4.94 million yuan. The Central South Engineering Management Bureau generally adopted bamboo scaffolding, which saves 57% of the cost compared to wooden scaffolding. Some areas in Northeast China also adopted advanced technologies such as "cold-drawn and cold-pressed" steel bars and "hollow walls" with lightweight concrete filling. Construction management has also seen some improvements. Eighteen units in Northeast China, North China, and Central South China have begun to conduct economic activity analysis.
    However, judging from the completion of planned targets in various regions and the actual work situation, there are still several relatively serious problems in our work:
    The originally set targets were not well completed. The construction plan for the first half of the year was only 76.8% completed, accounting for about 30% of the annual plan. The originally planned output value per worker per day was 21.33 yuan, but the actual output value only reached 18.16 yuan, which is 85.14% of the plan. Except for the East China, Southwest, and Northeast Engineering Management Bureaus, which overfulfilled the targets set by the ministry, the cost reduction plans of other units were not completed. The unbalanced completion of monthly plans is very serious. Many units fail to complete half of the monthly plan in the first and middle ten days of the month, and the rest is completed in the last ten days. Some units simply pursue the completion of workload targets, often violating construction sequence and doing the valuable parts first. As a result, although the monthly plan is completed, it creates great difficulties for the work in the next month, resulting in waste of manpower and materials and many quality and safety accidents.
    Quality accidents are quite serious. According to incomplete statistics for the first half of the year, a total of 2,350 quality accidents of various sizes occurred, resulting in losses of more than 196,000 yuan. Among these accidents, 14% were caused by unclear or incorrect technical instructions; 19% were caused by failure to construct according to drawings; 29.8% were caused by violations of operating procedures; and 12% were caused by lack of responsibility. Serious quality accidents occurred in many key projects. Quality accidents in installation projects are also common. On one construction site, all seventeen hydropower installation projects were reworked, resulting in great waste. The root cause of quality accidents is the arrogance and complacency of leaders and the lack of strict technical responsibility systems and technical supervision systems. Some people think that "since we have crossed big rivers and seas, we can't capsize in small rivers and streams," so they do not carefully study the drawings, do not strictly implement operating procedures, and technical personnel do not personally guide and supervise, and some even do not go to the site frequently. Accidents are not handled seriously after they occur; major accidents that may be political in nature are not alerted and investigated, but are treated indifferently, giving bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of.
    Some units do not provide sufficient safety education for workers, do not formulate safety measures according to the characteristics of the project, or provide incorrect technical guidance, violating operating procedures, so safety accidents are also very serious.
    The movement to practice strict economy and oppose waste is not deep, thorough, or universal. The supply of materials was basically guaranteed in the first half of the year, but the phenomenon of material backlog and waste is very serious. According to statistics from five units, including Northeast China, North China, East China, and directly affiliated companies, in addition to those that can be used in the second half of the year, materials worth about 25 million yuan (including new backlogs since the comprehensive economy drive) are still backlogged. According to statistics from the Materials Bureau, the new backlog this year plus the backlog of materials from previous years is worth about 75 million yuan, which exceeds the total material funds allocated by the state after the Ministry of Building Engineering assumed responsibility for materials. The waste caused by poor material management in some units is alarming. For example, at a construction site of the Datong General Company in North China, 4,200 cubic meters of timber entered the site, and more than 700 cubic meters are unaccounted for. The North China Directly Affiliated Company dug up four baskets of asphalt and more than 10,000 blue bricks from the ground. The 27th work area of the company completely demolished 300 cubic meters of templates. Other phenomena, such as the lack of rational planning on the site, improper stacking of materials, and the use of high-quality materials for low-quality purposes, long materials for short purposes, and large materials for small purposes, are also common. According to statistics from various companies in Northeast China, in the second quarter alone, more than 510,000 yuan was wasted on timber due to the use of high-quality materials for low-quality purposes. After the design and construction work conference, building installation companies generally paid attention to the control of labor, and except for a few places, no more workers were added. However, due to the excessive number of fixed workers and the reduction of engineering tasks, there is still a large amount of idleness. According to incomplete statistics, on-site idleness and non-full-day shutdowns accounted for about 16.1% of the total working time from January to May. Moreover, many units have too many non-production workers, some accounting for more than 20%. The labor discipline of some workers is poor, and their efficiency is very low. Administrative management expenses are also generally overspent. The reasons for overspending, in addition to the excessive number of overstaffed personnel that cannot be dealt with for a while, are mainly the extravagance and arbitrary expenditures of certain agencies. For example, the Lanzhou General Company sent people to spend more than 4,000 yuan to buy more than 2,400 rare flowers and trees in Wugong, Shaanxi, in order to "green" the environment. These situations show that the idea of economic accounting has not penetrated deeply into people's hearts, the atmosphere of opposing waste and practicing strict economy has not been universally established, and the work of reducing costs has not been fully implemented.
    The task of the Ministry of Building Engineering in the second half of the year is very tight and arduous. We must resolutely implement the central government's instruction on practicing comprehensive economy; nearly 70% of the engineering tasks for the whole year must be completed in the second half of the year, and strive to overfulfill the tasks; at the same time, we must prepare conditions for the large-scale commencement of factory building projects next year. Therefore, the general task of the Ministry of Building Engineering in the second half of this year is: taking the implementation of the central government's instruction on practicing comprehensive economy as the center, continue to carry out the anti-waste movement comprehensively and deeply, earnestly implement the planned management and economic accounting system, actively improve technology, improve engineering quality, launch labor competitions, ensure the comprehensive and overfulfillment of this year's engineering tasks, and actively prepare for next year's construction, and strive to fulfill the tasks assigned to us in the first five-year plan. In order to practice economy, we must take specific measures at all levels. In terms of design, we must correctly implement the State Council's regulations on reducing construction costs. Practicing economy in design work should have a comprehensive view, paying attention to both economy and quality and practicality, and also paying attention to aesthetics where possible, otherwise it will cause waste. The ratio of bungalows to buildings should be determined according to the specific conditions of different cities and regions. In some urban areas where there is not much land and the amount of construction is large, and there will be great development in the future, more buildings can be built. Conversely, the proportion of bungalows can be slightly higher. For productive buildings, modifications should be made appropriately in consultation with Party A where possible, without hindering the progress of construction and without reducing the quality of the project. The living rooms, laboratories, and office buildings of each factory should have different requirements according to their different uses. For example, the standards of general office buildings can be lower, and the standards of office buildings related to the production command system can be appropriately higher. The cost of various temporary projects should be reduced as much as possible. In warmer areas, more bamboo sheds or bamboo structure tile-roofed houses can be used. In design work, special attention should also be paid to saving steel and wood. India and Japan have both used bamboo reinforcement instead of steel reinforcement. The bamboo-reinforced concrete floor slab of Guangzhou No. 7 Middle School has not been damaged for more than 30 years. Shanghai built a bamboo-reinforced concrete bridge after liberation that can bear 20 tons. Therefore, in addition to using "cold-pressed and cold-drawn" prestressed steel bars, we must also promote the use of bamboo-reinforced concrete. This is entirely possible on structures with low loads. It should first be used extensively in roof panels, floor slabs, and small lintels. Wood is also very scarce in our country, so bamboo structures or bamboo-wood structures should be used more in construction to save wood. Bamboo scaffolding should be promoted more universally, which can save 40% to 50% of the cost compared to wooden scaffolding. The bamboo scaffolding used in the construction of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building was as high as 60 meters, which is safer than wooden scaffolding. Promoting inner scaffolding and movable scaffolding can save wood. Using local materials produced locally is an important measure to save money, and both design and construction units should pay attention to it. Strengthen planned management to ensure the completion of this year's targets. The current measures are: to determine tasks and projects, rationally arrange construction progress, and achieve relatively balanced construction on a quarterly and monthly basis, and strive to complete some of next year's tasks in advance this year as much as possible. At the same time, actively organize construction to start, and promote rain and winter construction. East China has created a bamboo frame movable rain shed for rain construction, which is a very good method, and all regions should think of some simple and easy-to-implement methods to reduce costs according to specific conditions. It is necessary to quickly determine the winter construction projects and cost standards, and formulate technical measures to ensure quality and safety. The five-year plan has been set, and the changes in the future project plan will not be too great. The design department should actively contact Party A and strive to design some projects that were originally planned to be designed next year in advance this year to prepare some reserve projects for next year. Only in this way can the situation of idleness in the first half of the year and rushing to work in the second half of the year be changed.
    It is necessary to correct the phenomenon of only focusing on construction progress and ignoring other work. Not only should we care about the completion of the construction plan, but we should pay more attention to mastering the comprehensive completion of the plan, so that various plans cooperate and connect with each other.
    In order to strengthen planned management and complete various plans, it is necessary to strengthen the work of grassroots organizations of building installation enterprises. At present, the weakness of grassroots organizations is widespread and serious. According to a survey by the First Engineering Office of the First Engineering Company of Northeast China: among 61 foremen, only 19 can read drawings and organize production; 22 can read drawings and have some construction experience, but lack organizational skills, and 20 cannot read drawings and have no construction experience and are very weak in ability. According to a survey by the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau: among 170 foremen, about 100 are illiterate. Due to the weakness of grassroots organizations, many tasks cannot be implemented. Some grassroots workers said: "The top is the headquarters, and the bottom is a small warehouse." Many instructions and documents enter the work section like they have entered a "warehouse." No one reads them and no one implements them. The Second Engineering Office of the First Engineering Company of Northeast China analyzed the causes of 15 quality accidents and found that 7 of them were caused by incorrect technical guidance from foremen. Therefore, vigorously strengthening grassroots organizations, especially strengthening the leadership of foremen, is an important link in improving the current work. The measures that should be taken are: first, adopt appropriate matching methods in the allocation of cadres. That is, technical personnel and old cadres are matched, cadres from worker backgrounds and cadres graduated from secondary technical schools are matched, and demobilized military cadres and experienced and technically proficient cadres are matched. It is necessary to train graduates from secondary technical schools to serve as deputy foremen, not only to let them work on forms and reports, but also to participate in the issuance of task lists, compile work plans for teams and groups, and direct production on the construction site, so that they can serve as foremen or construction workers in the future. Second, when the departments, bureaus, and companies streamline their institutions, transfer a group of cadres to enrich the grassroots. Third, the company should hold foreman training courses and conduct training in conjunction with production. Foremen, work section chiefs, and grassroots functional personnel should be trained once in one or two years. At the same time, select a group of excellent foremen to study at secondary technical schools for further study. Fourth, improve the status and role of foremen. Fifth, improve leadership style and working methods. The staff above should go deep into the front line, go to the front line to find problems and solve problems, streamline meetings, reduce reports, so as to reduce the burden on the grassroots and enable them to focus their main energy on leading production.
    Now, although slogans such as "A Century-Long Plan, Quality First" are erected on every construction site, many units have not placed the guarantee of engineering quality and the striving for construction progress in an equally important position. In order to improve this situation, in addition to repeatedly conducting education on ensuring engineering quality among the vast number of cadres and workers, a technical responsibility system must be established. This important system has not yet been established in many enterprises. In some places, not all technical personnel have been placed in technical positions, and some university graduates who study civil engineering and architecture are still working in non-technical functional departments, which is not right. More seriously, many technical personnel rarely go to the site, but are busy with other affairs, so that technical work is in a state of no one being responsible for it. In order to change this situation, it is necessary to strictly establish a responsibility system for technical personnel, place technical personnel in technical positions, and stipulate a system for them to work on the site frequently, so as to give play to their due role. At the same time, help them improve their organizational skills. The company manager, the work area director, the foreman must also personally grasp the leadership of technical work, grasp the supervision and inspection of engineering quality. Before construction, leaders and technical personnel must carefully study the drawings before they can provide detailed technical instructions to workers, so that workers understand how to operate correctly. In order to strictly implement operating procedures, technical lessons should be given to workers in their spare time. A strict technical inspection and technical supervision system should be established, and strict technical inspections should be carried out for each process, and a system of acceptance of hidden works, intermediate acceptance, transfer inspection, and mass quality mutual inspection and self-inspection should be implemented. In particular, technical supervision stations should be established on each construction site to assist foremen, work section chiefs, work area directors, and chief engineers in conducting quality inspections and technical supervision. At present, establishing technical supervision stations is an important measure to ensure engineering quality. Each construction site must also actively establish material testing stations and gradually equip them with technical supervision personnel. In the future, serious quality accidents must be dealt with seriously, especially for political sabotage accidents, they must be thoroughly investigated and severely dealt with.
    The issue of safe production is an old issue. The important key to overcoming and reducing safety accidents lies in the fact that leaders should pay sufficient attention to safe production and establish a special responsibility system.
    Overcome all waste and implement the economic accounting system. In terms of materials, the first thing to do is to actively handle backlogged materials. The methods are: compile a catalog of backlogged materials and send it to the design unit for use in design; carefully do a good job in allocation and balance, first carry out adjustment and balance within the company and within the bureau, and those that still cannot be resolved should be reported to the ministry for resolution; adopt the method of borrowing, and rely on the local government to organize material exchange meetings to adjust and process locally. Secondly, strengthen the planning of material supply. The material demand plan should be mainly based on the production and technical departments, and should be compiled strictly in accordance with technical documents and budget quotas. No insurance coefficient should be increased at will, and the phased demand should be put forward according to the construction progress. In a word, do not blindly prepare materials. For those who purchase too much, repurchase, or purchase the wrong materials, the responsibility must be investigated and necessary punishments must be given. At the same time, it is necessary to seriously conduct surveys of local economic resources and use local materials with the shortest transportation distance as much as possible, which is a great source of savings. In terms of labor use, each unit should balance according to the needs of engineering tasks. In the future, a wage fund management system should be established to control the use of labor in a planned manner. The problem of using skilled workers instead of strong workers cannot be completely avoided in the short term. At present, some skilled workers feel "not glorious" after taking on the work of strong workers, and leading staff also feel "unjustified" when explaining it. This is not right. It is necessary to explain to the workers that this is a last resort under the circumstances of a large amount of idleness, and it is also a relatively reasonable method. It is beneficial to both the country and the workers themselves to do so. On-site workers and idle workers should be separated and a shift work system should be implemented, which can be rotated once a month, which is also a method of solving idleness. In terms of financial costs, the plan for the transfer of profits and basic depreciation must be strictly implemented. It is necessary to control the expenditure of administrative management fees and strictly implement financial discipline. In order to implement the economic accounting system, the work of design budget and project settlement must be improved. At present, the design budget cannot be compiled in time, so that the contract cannot be signed in time, which also affects the project settlement. In order to implement the economic accounting system, the economic activity analysis work should be further promoted. At present, some analyzes are not in-depth, do not grasp the key, and the measures are not specific and powerful enough. Therefore, leaders at all levels are required to pay attention to it, personally do it, and regard economic activity analysis as an important means and effective method to improve work. After economic activity analysis, grasp the key issues, put forward specific measures to overcome shortcomings and tap potential, and the person responsible for implementing various measures should be determined. At present, the conditions for conducting economic activity analysis in grassroots work sections are not very good, and efforts should be made to create conditions. In the second half of this year, some factory building projects will start, and this aspect of construction work will be fully launched next year. Therefore, doing a good job in construction preparation in the second half of this year is of decisive significance for completing the tasks we undertake in the five-year plan. If the preparation is not good, there will be no guarantee for the completion of the task. Time is very tight and cannot be delayed any longer. At present, according to the requirements of the national plan and the progress of design drawings supply, the construction unit should specifically formulate the overall construction plan and the overall progress plan with the construction unit, and actively compile the corresponding construction organization design of the factory area and the comprehensive design of the off-site project according to the design stage. It is necessary to carry out the standardization of industrial building design in order to gradually promote building industrialization. The construction unit must organize relevant personnel to seize the time to study the drawings.
    In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the management of professional companies and improve the relationship between general contractors and subcontractors. Improve the business level and technical level of employees through systematic learning from Soviet experts and opening training courses.
    Our task is arduous and urgent. Only by making the greatest efforts, improving our level, and improving our style can we guarantee the completion of the plan. I believe that under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, and relying on the efforts of all employees, we will definitely be able to complete the task.

### 全面完成今年的工程任务

专栏：努力完成和超额完成一九五五年计划

    全面完成今年的工程任务
    建筑工程部长　刘秀峰
    今年二月建筑工程部设计及施工工作会议以后，建筑工程的设计工作和施工工作都有好的转变。这个转变为争取全面完成今年的工程任务创造了条件。设计人员学习全苏建筑工作人员会议文件和建筑工程部设计及施工工作会议文件后，进一步体会了党中央早就提的“适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的正确的建筑原则，提高了设计思想，批判了忽视经济和适用的资产阶级形式主义和复古主义倾向，检查并修改了一些不合理的设计。现在，那种豪华的“大屋顶”式的设计已经停止，高标准的“框子”已被打破了。根据初步估算，建筑工程部今年担负的民用建筑设计经过修改或重新设计，即可为国家节省数千万元。
    在施工方面，许多施工单位注意了编制年度施工财务计划、施工组织作业设计（简称施工设计），签订了合同和协议。几年来都经常发生的仓促开工，不研究施工规律，违反基本建设程序，盲目进行准备的现象，开始有了转变；由于现场布置不当，开工后材料搬家、暂设工程拆迁和缺水停电的现象也已减少。许多施工单位开展了厉行节约、反对浪费的运动。在运动中，凡是领导人员亲自动手，发动了群众，揭发浪费、分析原因和改进工作建立制度相结合的单位，成效都好。东北第二公司揭发出浪费事实五千五百多件，共值二百六十万元；广大职工在运动中提出了五百八十九件合理化建议，仅第二工程处已经执行的三百六十七件，即可节约三十多万元。许多单位的材料管理工作有了改进，注意了按计划采购，调查货源和比质量、比价钱、比运输距离，注意了利用旧料、废料和代用品。东北第一公司利用次料、残料和旧料，节约元木七千立方公尺。西北工程管理总局，执行苏联专家建议，以工地附近的滻河卵石代替约一百公里外开采的碎石，即可节省四百九十四万元。中南工程管理总局普遍采用了竹脚手架，比用木脚手架节省费用百分之五十七。东北某些地区还采用了“冷拉冷压”钢筋和轻质混凝土填心的“空心墙”等先进技术。施工管理工作也有一些改进。东北、华北、中南等地的十八个单位，开始做经济活动分析工作。　　但是，从各地完成计划指标的情况和实际工作情况看来，我们工作中还有几个比较严重的问题：
    原订各项计划指标完成得不好。上半年施工计划仅完成百分之七十六点八，约占年计划的百分之三十；原计划每个工人每日工作的产值是二十一点三三元，实际只达到一十八点一六元，即达到计划的百分之八十五点一四。降低成本计划除华东、西南、东北工程管理总局超额完成部定指标外，其余各单位都未完成计划。每月完成计划不均衡的情况非常严重。许多单位上中旬完不成月计划的一半，其余都靠下旬来完成。有些单位单纯为了追求完成工作量指标，往往违反施工顺序，找值钱的先做，结果虽然完成了本月计划，却为下月工作造成极大困难，人力物力的浪费和许多质量安全事故也由此产生。
    质量事故相当严重。据上半年不完全的统计，共发生大小质量事故二千三百五十次，损失十九万六千多元。这些事故中属于技术交底不清或交底错误所造成的占百分之十四；不按图纸施工者占百分之十九，违反操作规程者占百分之二十九点八；无人负责者占百分之十二。有许多重点工程发生严重质量事故。安装工程的质量事故也很普遍。有一个工地十七项水电安装工程全部返工，造成很大浪费。发生质量事故的根本原因，是由于领导人员骄傲自满和缺乏严格的技术责任制度和技术监督制度。有的人认为“大江大海都过了，小河小水翻不了船”，因而不认真研究图纸，不严格执行操作规程，技术人员不去亲自指导和监督，甚至有的经常不去现场；事故发生后也不严肃处理；对很可能是属于政治性的重大事故也不加警惕和追查，漠然视之，给坏分子以可乘之机。
    有些单位对工人进行的安全教育不够，不根据工程的特点制定安全措施，或者技术指导错误，违反操作规程，所以安全事故也很严重。
    厉行节约，反对浪费的运动目前还不深、不透、不普遍。上半年基本上保证了材料的供应，但材料积压和浪费现象非常严重。据东北、华北、华东、直属公司等五个单位统计，除了下半年能使用者外，尚积压价值约二千五百多万元（包括自全面节约以后的新积压）的材料。据材料总局统计，今年新的积压加上历年积压材料约值七千五百万元，这已超过建筑工程部包料后国家拨给的全部材料资金。有的单位因材料管理不善而造成的浪费是惊人的。如华北大同总公司某工地进场木材四千二百立方公尺，有七百多立方公尺下落不明。华北直属公司在地下挖出沥青四篓，青砖一万多块。该公司第二十七工区把三百立方公尺的模板全部拆毁。其他如现场缺乏合理规划，材料的堆放不当，优材劣用、长材短用、大材小用的现象也很普遍。据东北地区各公司统计，第二季仅木材因优材劣用一项即浪费五十一万多元。设计及施工工作会议以后，各建筑安装企业一般是注意了劳动力的控制，除少数地方以外，没有再增加工人。但由于固定工人过多和工程任务削减，仍有大量窝工。据不完全统计，一至五月份现场窝工和非全日停工两项约占全部作业时间的百分之十六点一。而且许多单位非生产用工过多，有的占百分之二十以上。有些工人劳动纪律不好，效率很低。行政管理费也普遍超支。超支的原因，除因超编人员过多，一时不能处理外，主要是某些机关的铺张浪费和任意开支。如兰州总公司为了“绿化”环境，派人拿四千多元到陕西武功一带买奇花异木二千四百多株。这些情况说明，经济核算的思想还没有深入人心，反对浪费、厉行节约的风气还没有普遍地树立起来，降低成本的工作还没有全面地贯彻下去。
    建筑工程部下半年的任务是十分紧张而艰巨的。我们必须坚决贯彻中央关于厉行全面节约的指示；占全年计划近百分之七十的工程任务必须在下半年完成，并争取超额完成；同时，要为明年厂房工程大量的开工准备好条件。因此，建筑工程部今年下半年的总任务就是：以贯彻中央关于厉行全面节约的指示为中心，继续全面地和深入地开展反浪费运动，认真贯彻计划管理和经济核算制，积极提高技术，改进工程质量，开展劳动竞赛，保证全面和超额地完成今年的工程任务，并积极地做好明年的施工准备，为实现国家第一个五年计划交付我们的任务而奋斗。为了厉行节约，我们必须在各个环节上采取具体的措施。在设计方面，必须正确执行国务院关于降低建筑造价的规定。在设计工作中厉行节约，应当有全面的观点，既要注意经济，又要注意质量和适用，也要在可能条件下注意美观，否则反会造成浪费。平房和楼房的比例，要按不同城市、不同地区的具体情况而定。有的市区土地不多而建筑量较大，将来有大发展的，就可多建些楼房。反之，平房比例可稍高。对生产性建筑，也应在不妨碍施工进度和不降低工程质量的条件下，凡可能进行修改设计者应商同甲方作适当修改。对各厂的生活间、试验室、办公楼应根据其不同用途有不同要求。如一般办公楼的标准可低些，生产指挥系统有关的办公楼的标准可适当高些。各项暂设工程的造价更应尽可能降低。在气候较暖地区，可多采用竹棚或竹结构瓦顶的房子。在设计工作中，还应特别注意节省钢材和木材等。以竹筋代钢筋，印度、日本均采用过。广州第七中学的竹筋混凝土楼板三十多年来未坏。上海在解放后修建了一座竹筋混凝土桥梁，能承重二十吨。因此，我们除了要采用“冷压冷拔”预加应力的钢筋以外，还要推广采用竹筋混凝土。这在荷重不大的结构上是完全可能的。首先应在屋面板、楼板、小过梁等构件中大量采用。木材在我国也很缺乏，因此在建筑中应多采用竹结构或竹木结构，以节省木材。竹脚手架更应普遍推广，它比木脚手架可节约百分之四十至百分之五十的费用。建筑上海中苏友好大厦时用的竹脚手架高达六十公尺，比木脚手架还安全。推行里脚手架和活动脚手架都能节省木材。使用当地出产的地方材料是节约的一项重要措施，设计和施工单位都应注意。加强计划管理，保证完成今年的各项计划指标。当前的措施是：要确定任务和项目，合理地安排施工进度，作到按季按月比较均衡的施工，要尽可能争取在今年提前完成明年的一些任务。同时，要积极组织开工，推行雨天施工和冬季施工。华东搞了雨天施工的竹架活动雨棚，办法很好，各地都应根据具体情况，多想些简单易行的降低费用的办法。要迅速确定冬季施工的项目和取费标准，制定保证质量和安全的技术措施。五年计划已定，今后的工程计划变动不会太大，设计部门应主动跟甲方联系，争取把原计划在明年设计的一些工程提前在今年进行设计，为明年多准备一些储备工程。这样才能改变上半年窝工、下半年赶工的状况。
    要纠正只抓施工进度忽视其他工作的现象。不仅要关心施工计划的完成，而更应该注意掌握全面完成计划，使各种计划互相配合，互相衔接。
    为了加强计划管理，完成各种计划，必须切实地加强建筑安装企业基层组织的工作。目前基层组织薄弱是普遍而严重的。据东北第一工程公司第一工程处调查：六十一名工长中能看懂图纸、能组织生产的仅十九名；能看懂图纸，有些施工经验，而缺乏组织能力者二十二人，看不懂图纸，又无施工经验，能力很差者二十名。又据太原工程局的调查：一百七十名工长中，文盲有一百人左右。由于基层组织薄弱，许多工作不能贯彻下去。有的基层工作人员说：“上边是司令部，下边是小仓库”，许多指示文件到了工段就像入了“仓库”，没人看也没人贯彻实行。东北第一工程公司第二工程处分析了十五次质量事故的原因，发现有七次是由于工长技术指导错误而引起的。因此，大力加强基层组织，特别是加强对工长的领导，是当前改进工作的重要环节。应当采取的办法是：第一，在干部配备上采取适当搭配的办法。即技术人员和老干部搭配，工人出身的干部和中等技术学校毕业的干部搭配，部队转业干部和有经验、懂技术的干部搭配。要培养中等技术学校毕业生担任副工长，不能只让他们搞表报，要他们参加签发任务单，编制班组作业计划，并在施工现场指挥生产，使他们将来能担任工长或施工员的职务。第二，在部、局和公司精简机构时，抽调一批干部充实基层。第三，由公司举办工长训练班，结合生产进行训练。要在一、二年内把工长、工段长及基层职能人员轮训一遍。同时选送一批优秀的工长去中等技术学校学习，深造。第四，提高工长的地位和作用。第五，改进领导作风和工作方法，上边的工作人员要深入现场，到现场去发现问题和解决问题，精简会议，减少报表，以减轻基层的负担，使他们以主要精力去领导生产。
    现在，各个工地上虽然都竖立着“百年大计、质量第一”的标语，但是有许多单位还没有把保证工程质量和争取施工进度提到同等重要的地位上来。为了改善这种情况，除了在广大干部和工人中反复地进行保证工程质量的教育外，必须建立技术责任制。这个重要的制度至今还有许多企业没有建立。有些地方还没有把技术人员都放在技术岗位上，有些学土木建筑的大学毕业生，仍在非技术的职能部门工作，这是不应该的。更严重的是许多技术人员很少到现场，而忙于其他事务，以致技术工作处于无人负责的状态。为了改变这种状况，要严格地建立技术人员的责任制度，把技术人员放在技术岗位上，并规定他们经常在现场工作的制度，发挥他们应有的作用；同时帮助他们提高组织能力，公司经理、工区主任、工长亦要亲自抓紧对技术工作的领导，抓紧对工程质量的监督和检查。领导人员和技术人员在施工以前必须认真研究图纸，才可能向工人细致地进行技术交底，使工人懂得如何正确地操作。为了严格地贯彻操作规程，应利用业余时间给工人上技术课。要建立严格的技术检查和技术监督制度，对每道工序都要实行严格的技术检查，实行隐蔽工程验收、中间验收、交接检查制和群众性的质量互检、自检制度。特别要在各工地建立技术监督站，帮助工长、工段长、工区主任和总工程师进行质量检查和技术监督。在目前，建立技术监督站是保证工程质量的一项重要措施。各工地还要积极建立材料试验站，并逐渐配备技术监督人员。今后对于重大的质量事故必须严肃处理，特别是对带有政治性的破坏事故，必须彻底追究，严加处理。
    安全生产问题，是个老问题。克服和减少安全事故的重要关键在于领导人员对安全生产应有足够的重视，并建立专责制度。
    克服一切浪费，贯彻经济核算制。在材料方面，首先要积极处理积压材料。办法是：把积压材料编成目录送设计单位，以便在设计中加以利用；认真做好调拨平衡，先在公司内部、局内部进行调剂平衡，仍无法解决者报部解决；采取借出的办法，依靠当地政府组织物资交流会就地调剂处理。其次，加强材料供应的计划工作。材料需用计划应以生产技术部门为主，严格地按技术文件、预算定额进行编制，不得随便加大保险系数，并要按施工进度提出分期的需要量。一句话就是不得盲目备料。对多购、重购、错购的，必须查明责任予以必要的处分。同时，要认真进行当地经济资源的勘察工作，尽可能利用运距最短的地方材料，这是一项很大的节约来源。在劳动力使用方面，各单位应根据工程任务的需要进行平衡。今后要建立工资基金管理制度，有计划地控制劳动力的使用。以技工代壮工，不是短期内可以完全避免的问题。目前有些技工担负了壮工的工作后，感到“不光荣”，领导工作人员进行解释时也觉得“理屈”，这是不对的。要向工人说明，这是在大量窝工的情况下，不得已才采用的办法，也是比较合理的办法，这样作对国家和工人自己都是有利的。现场工人和窝工工人要分开，实行轮班工作，可一月轮换一次，这也是一种解决窝工的方法。在财务成本方面，必须严格执行利润和基本折旧的上缴计划。要控制行政管理费的开支，严格执行财政纪律。为了贯彻经济核算制，必须改善设计预算和工程结算的工作。目前设计预算还不能及时编出，以致不能及时签订合同，也影响了工程结算。为了贯彻经济核算制，应当进一步推行经济活动分析工作。目前有些分析不深入，抓不住关键，措施也不够具体有力。因此要求各级领导人员予以重视，亲自动手，把经济活动分析当作改进工作的重要手段和有效方法。经过经济活动分析，抓住关键问题，提出克服缺点和挖掘潜力的具体措施，并应确定执行各项措施的负责者。目前基层工段普遍进行经济活动分析的条件还不很具备，应当努力创造条件。今年下半年有部分的厂房工程开工，明年将要全面展开这方面的施工工作。因此在今年下半年做好施工准备工作，对于完成我们在五年计划中担负的任务具有决定意义。如果准备不好，完成任务就没有保证。时间十分紧迫，不能再推迟了。当前应按照国家计划的要求和设计图纸供应的进度，同建设单位具体制定施工总体规划和总进度计划，按设计阶段积极地编制厂区的相应的施工组织设计和厂外工程的综合设计。要进行工业建筑设计的标准化工作，以便逐步推行建筑工业化。施工单位必须组织有关人员抓紧学习图纸。
    此外，还必须加强专业公司的管理工作，改善总包和分包的关系。通过有系统地向苏联专家学习的办法和开训练班的办法，提高职工的业务水平和技术水平。
    我们的任务是艰巨的、紧迫的，只有作最大的努力，提高我们的水平，改进我们的作风，才能保证计划的完成。相信在党的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，依靠全体职工的努力，我们一定能够完成任务。
