    Two Thousand Years of Friendly Relations Between the Chinese and Japanese People
    Shao Xunzheng
    The Chinese and Japanese people have a profound friendship spanning two thousand years. The two peoples have maintained close economic and cultural ties and mutual influence, as continuously recorded in the historical records of both countries and constantly clarified by historians in their research.

    In ancient times, the working people of Japan created their own culture with high wisdom and diligent labor. At the same time, they humbly learned from China, whose culture had already reached a high level of development. In modern times, China, under the oppression of Western imperialism, also humbly learned from Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At that time, Chinese intellectuals, using Japan as an intermediary, attempted to rely on the democratic politics and science and technology of the Western bourgeoisie to save China from its predicament. Although bourgeois democracy and culture were ultimately proven unable to save China, the result of learning from Japan played a significant role in promoting the old democratic revolution at that time.

    Whether viewed from a geographical perspective or from the perspective of cultural and economic relations, China and Japan have an inseparable and interconnected relationship. Now, both peoples are eager for more cultural and economic exchanges. Therefore, it is of great significance today to review the long history of friendly relations between the two peoples.

    As early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC, Chinese culture began to spread to Japan despite extremely difficult navigation conditions. Many Japanese-made bronze bells, closely resembling ancient pre-Qin bells, have been discovered in the San'in and Hokuriku regions of Japan. Japanese historians believe that early Chinese culture was introduced to Japan via the natural navigation route of the counter-clockwise current in the Sea of Japan, using primitive means of transportation. The working people opened the road of Sino-Japanese transportation with amazing wisdom and courage. During the same period, Chinese bronze swords, spears, and other objects were also introduced to the North Kyushu region of Japan via the Tsushima Current from Korea.

    During the Han and Three Kingdoms periods, traffic between China and the North Kyushu area gradually increased. Ancient Chinese books such as "Han Shu" and "Wei Zhi" constantly recorded "Wa Kingdom" and "Wa people," referring to the residents of the North Kyushu area. Many Han Dynasty artifacts have been discovered in various parts of Japan. The most noteworthy of these is the Huoquan coin from the Wang Mang era. Formal exchanges between Cao Wei and the "Wa Queen Kingdom" (North Kyushu) began in 238 AD, occurring six times in ten years. Precious Chinese brocade, woolen fabrics, and general daily necessities were continuously introduced to North Kyushu. The "Wei Zhi: Wa Ren Zhuan" records that the Chinese silk industry had been introduced to North Kyushu by the early 3rd century, with local residents reeling silk by holding cocoons in their mouths. At that time, the social and economic organization of northern China had a great impact on Japan.

    By the mid-4th century AD, North Kyushu had come under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Yamato Dynasty. Soon after, Japan began formal exchanges with the Chinese "Southern Dynasties." The "Wa Kingdom" mentioned in Chinese historical materials at the time (such as the Book of Song) was already a general term for Japan, not specifically referring to North Kyushu. Japan had already been in contact with Sun Wu during the Three Kingdoms period, and therefore referred to the Southern Dynasties of Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen as "Wu." The number of Chinese people going to Japan from the Southern Dynasties gradually increased, including famous weavers and tailors. Chinese people had specific residential areas in Japan, called "Wu Yuan." At this time, not only did clothing tailoring and the silk industry greatly change in Japan, but general education, rituals, and customs were also deeply influenced by the culture of the Chinese Southern Dynasties. Japanese people began to learn Chinese characters and Chinese books. The "Qin people" and "Han people" mentioned in Japanese historical records had long been continuously migrating to Japan from Lelang and Daifang in the Korean Peninsula. These people were all talented people welcomed by Japanese society at that time. For example, some "Han people" acquired the title of "Aya people" for their superior silk weaving techniques. Subsequently, many Chinese potters, painters, and saddle makers moved from Baekje to Japan.

    During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Japanese intellectuals directly explored the source of Chinese culture. Japan sent a large number of students to study in China. This was a very significant event in the cultural history of the two countries. At that time, the majority of Japanese students were "scholar-monks" who came to "seek Buddhism," but the breadth of study and length of stay (often up to twenty or thirty years) of general Japanese "students" enrolled in the Tang Imperial College made it possible for them to not only study traditional Chinese Confucianism but also to delve into specialized fields such as Chinese literature, law, medicine, and astronomy. In the 8th century, Japanese students such as Kibi no Makibi, Ōe no Otonda, Genbō, and Chao Heng (Abe no Nakamaro) were famous for a time. Chao Heng graduated from the Imperial College and remained in the service of the Tang Dynasty. He associated with famous literati such as Li Bai and Wang Wei, leaving behind many poems. Ōe no Otonda studied law and revised the law after returning to Japan. Kibi no Makibi studied classics and history, bringing back to the country Tang rituals, the Dayan Calendar, music books, and weapons. It is said that the katakana syllabary commonly used in Japan originated from him. "Scholar-monks," in addition to studying Buddhism, often paid attention to general culture and brought back a large number of classics, rubbings from stone inscriptions, and collections of poetry and prose when they returned to their country. Tang Dynasty Buddhist art, such as Buddhist temple architecture and Buddhist statue sculptures, also had a great influence on Japan.

    The close relationship between China and Japan during the Tang Dynasty was maintained to a considerable extent even during the turbulent situation of the Five Dynasties. The trade between Wuyue and Japan at that time was particularly frequent, because Mingzhou (Ningbo) had always been the gateway for Sino-Japanese communication. Soon, in the 11th century, Japanese rulers prohibited people from crossing the sea without permission, and Japanese ships disappeared from China. However, Northern Song merchant ships continued to travel to Japan, and the exchange of goods between China and Japan continued. The goods carried by Chinese merchants were silk, damask, fragrant medicines, teacups, stationery, and other items. Japanese exports mainly included gold dust, mercury, cotton, silk, cloth, and newly developed fine art crafts such as fans, screens, mother-of-pearl inlays, crystal handicrafts, knives, and swords. The market of Xiangguo Temple in Bianjing (Kaifeng) in the Northern Song Dynasty sold Japanese fans. People in the Song Dynasty praised the paintings on the fans, saying: "The meaning is profound, and the brushstrokes are exquisite." Ouyang Xiu's "Song of the Japanese Sword" says: "Precious swords have recently come from the country of Japan, and the Yue merchants obtained them from the east of the vast sea." The other crafts mentioned above were also praised by people at that time. Japanese monks who entered the Song Dynasty were also treated with great courtesy.

    In the latter half of the 12th century, Japanese rulers encouraged trade between merchant ships and the Southern Song Dynasty, and the Southern Song Dynasty also paid attention to attracting foreign merchant ships. The Sequel to the Qingyuan Siming Gazetteer says, "The Wa people brave the dangers of the whale-infested waves, and their ships connect prow to stern, selling their goods." At the same time, the Southern Song Dynasty welcomed Japanese ships to Mingzhou (China's main trading port with Japan), "providing wine and food, and holding banquets to reward them," treating them with utmost courtesy. Chinese and Japanese merchant ships traveled between Mingzhou (the main trading port for China with Japan) and Hakata (Japan's trading port). The frequent trade made Song Dynasty currency popular in Japan. At the same time, a large number of Japanese monks came to the Southern Song Dynasty aboard merchant ships. Many Southern Song monks also went to Japan. Chan Buddhism, which was particularly prevalent in the Southern Song Dynasty, was continuously introduced to Japan. The "sayings" of famous Chinese monks at the time often recorded the names of Japanese monks. Various versions of the Tripitaka printed in Fuzhou were introduced to Japan, greatly stimulating the development of the Japanese printing industry. In the early 13th century, the Confucianism of the Southern Song Dynasty, represented by Zhu Xi, was introduced to Japan. In 1247, someone in Japan, under the pseudonym "Louxiangzi," reprinted the Song edition of Zhu Xi's Commentary on the Analects in ten volumes, which was the beginning of Japanese printing of Chinese Confucian books. Chinese tea varieties and the Southern Song custom of "drinking tea" were also widely spread in Japan through Chan monks. It can be seen that the economic and cultural exchanges between China and Japan continued to increase during the Southern Song Dynasty.

    In the latter half of the 13th century, relations between the Yuan Dynasty rulers and Japan deteriorated sharply, and Chinese merchant ships disappeared from Japan. However, Japanese merchant ships continued to come to China, and generally received generous treatment from the people. Sino-Japanese trade still occupied an important position, and there were still many monks from Japan who came to China. Shaolin Temple on Mount Song still has a stone tablet inscribed by the Japanese monk Guyuan Shaoyuan during the Yuan Dynasty. Japanese monks encountered "giant floods" in Songjiang, and Chinese monks thought of him as "a foreigner, bitterly staying through the winter, coming here for seven years, treating him like family." There are many similar records in the biographies of Japanese monks who entered the Yuan Dynasty.

    During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the close cultural and economic ties between China and Japan surpassed those of previous times. During the Ashikaga shogunate period, Japanese envoys traveled from Ningbo to Beijing. They conducted trade along the way in places such as Hangzhou and Nanjing. In addition to general industrial products, Japan exported large quantities of copper and sulfur. A large amount of Ming Dynasty copper coins were imported into Japan, promoting the development of the monetary economy in Japan. Chinese paintings and other works of art aroused widespread interest among the Japanese people. A large number of Chinese merchant ships sailed to Nagasaki, a trading port in Japan. During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, trade was even more prosperous. The goods brought to Japan by Chinese merchant ships included many products from fifteen provinces. A large number of Chinese books were exported to Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate set up a special official in Nagasaki to inspect imported books, employing people with a thorough knowledge of Chinese editions. Chinese people who resided in Nagasaki during the Ming and Qing dynasties also made great contributions to Japanese culture. Chen Deming and others' medical skills, and the calligraphy of Lin Daorong and Gao Tianyi, the "Two Wonders of Nagasaki," were highly respected by the Japanese people. It should be especially mentioned that Zhu Shunshui, who insisted on resisting the rule of the Manchus, initiated the practice of lecturing in Japan, and the Japanese academic community was deeply influenced by his noble thoughts.

    After modern Western imperialism invaded the East, Sino-Japanese relations underwent drastic changes. After the Opium War, China fell into the abyss of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism. Japan learned from the West earlier and faster, and in the last thirty years of the 19th century, it rapidly developed into a modern nation. At that time, Chinese bourgeois reformists such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao enthusiastically studied Japanese experiences, believing that they could find a way to save China. Soon, a large number of Chinese youths went to Japan to study, and Japanese works on natural science and social science were also translated into Chinese in large quantities. The "new learning" before and after the Xinhai Revolution was mostly introduced to China from Japan, which caused a certain degree of shaking to the feudal "old learning." Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of the Chinese democratic revolution, used Japan as a base for revolutionary activities. He received the sympathy and support of the Japanese people. The process by which the Chinese people began to study Marxism was also closely related to the Japanese academic community's introduction of Marxist theory. In the early 20th century, Chinese bourgeois revolutionary democrats had already begun to introduce the lives of Marx and Engels and the main points of the Communist Manifesto from Japanese books. Comrade Li Dazhao, one of China's earliest communists, had already come into contact with Marxism in Japan before the October Revolution. Lu Xun studied in Japan in his early years, and later he also studied Marxism by translating and studying Japanese works. Many of the early translated Marxist classics in China were translated from Japanese. Japanese translations helped spread Marxism in China around the time of the May Fourth Movement.

    Two thousand years of history show that China and Japan have been living in peace except for some short periods of war. Two of these wars, which were also the largest two, occurred in the most recent sixty years. Especially the latter one, due to the monstrous crimes of the Japanese militarists, caused the Chinese people to suffer extremely brutal devastation, caused the Japanese people to suffer painful foreign enslavement, and also caused the normal relations between China and Japan to not have been restored to this day after ten years.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government and people have made many efforts to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the Japanese people's desire for peace, democracy, and national independence. The Chinese people deeply know that an independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan that is not controlled by external forces is an indispensable factor for peace in Asia and the world. Although the social systems of China and Japan are different, they can completely coexist peacefully. This is just as Premier Zhou Enlai recently said when meeting with the delegation of the Japanese press and broadcasting circles visiting China: "We have always believed that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. Especially China and Japan are neighbors, and have a long history of peaceful and friendly coexistence for thousands of years, with only a few years not being so. People often like to say that China and Japan are of the same script and race. In principle, as long as we base ourselves on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward in the Joint Statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India, or the Ten Principles in the Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation of the Asian-African Conference, Sino-Japanese relations can be normalized, and China and Japan can achieve true coexistence and co-prosperity."

    两千年来中日人民的友好关系
    邵循正
    中国人民和日本人民有两千年的深厚友谊，两国人民在经济上和文化上一直有着密切的联系和相互的影响，这是两国史籍所不断记载而为历史学者们在研究中所不断阐明了的。
    古代日本劳动人民以高度的智慧和辛勤的劳动，创造了自己的文化，他们同时虚心地向文化已有高度发展的中国学习。近代中国在西方帝国主义压迫下，在十九世纪末叶和二十世纪初年，也曾虚心地向日本学习过。当时中国知识分子，曾经以日本为媒介，企图依靠西方资产阶级的民主政治和科学技术，把中国从危难中挽救出来。虽然资产阶级的民主和文化终于已被证明不能拯救中国，但是向日本学习的结果，对当时旧民主主义革命的进行，曾起了很大的推动作用。
      中国和日本无论就地理形势上看，就文化和经济的关系上看，都有不可割绝的息息相通的联系。现在两国人民都在渴望更多的文化上和经济上的交流。因此在今天回顾两国人民长期友好的历史，是有重大的意义的。
    早在公元前二、三世纪，在航海条件极其困难的情况下，中国文化已开始传入日本。日本山阴、北陆等地曾发现了很多形状酷似先秦古钟的日本制造的铜铎。日本历史学者认为中国早期文化曾以原始的交通工具通过日本海左旋回流的自然航路传入日本。劳动人民以惊人的智慧和勇敢开辟了中日交通的道路。在同时期中，中国的铜剑、铜鉾等物也经朝鲜横渡对马海流传入日本北九州等地区。
    在两汉三国时代，中国和北九州一带交通渐多。中国古籍如“汉书”、“魏志”所不断记载的“倭国”、“倭人”，即指北九州一带的居民。汉代古物在日本各地曾多所发现，其中最值得注意的是王莽时代的货泉。曹魏和“倭女王国”（北九州）的正式联使来往，从公元二三八年开始，十年之中就有六次。中国珍贵的锦绣、毛织物和一般生活用品不断传入北九州。“魏志”“倭人传”记载，在三世纪初中国蚕业已传入北九州，当地居民把茧含在口中抽丝。当时中国北方社会经济的组织，对日本也发生很大的影响。
    到了公元后四世纪中叶，北九州已归日本大和朝管辖，日本不久就和中国的“南朝”开始正式的通聘。当时中国史料（如宋书）所提到的“倭国”，已经是泛指日本，不是专指北九州了。日本早同三国时代的孙吴已有来往，因此沿称南朝的宋、齐、梁、陈为“吴”。南朝中国人到日本的渐多，其中有著名的织工和裁缝。中国人在日本有特定的居留地，号“吴原”。这时日本不但衣服裁制和蚕织事业大大改观，一般文教和礼俗也深受当时中国南朝文化的影响。日本人开始学习汉字和中国书籍。日本史籍所称的“秦人”和“汉人”，早已由朝鲜半岛的乐浪、带方等处不断地移入日本。这些人都是当时日本社会所欢迎的有艺能的人。如有些“汉人”就以织绢的优越技术取得了“绫人”的称号。此后更有不少的中国陶工、画工、鞍匠从百济移到日本。
    到了隋唐时代，日本知识界直接探取中国文化的源泉。日本派遣大批学生到中国留学。这是两国文化史上的一个十分重大的事件。当时日本留学生中较多数的是为“求佛教”而来的“学问僧”，但入学于唐国子监的一般日本“学生”学习范围之广，留学年限之长（多至二三十年），使他们有可能不仅研究中国传统儒学，并且精研中国文学或是法律、医药、天文等专门学问。八世纪的日本留学生中，如吉备真备、大和长冈、玄昉、朝衡（阿部仲麿）都有名一时。朝衡卒业太学，留仕于唐。他同李白、王维等著名文人交游，留下很多诗篇。大和长冈学法律，回日本后删定律令。吉备真备研究经史，携唐礼、大衍历、乐书、兵器归国，相传日本通行的片假名，即出其手。“学问僧”在学习佛法外，也经常注意一般文化，回国时也带回大量的经典、碑帖和诗文集。唐代佛教艺术如佛寺建筑和佛像雕塑，对日本也发生很大的影响。
    唐代中日密切来往的关系，在五代纷扰的局面下依然相当地保持着。当时的吴越和日本贸易来往特别频繁，因为明州（宁波）一向是中日交通的门户。不久，到十一世纪，日本统治者禁止人民私自渡海，日船绝迹于中国。但北宋商舶仍不断前往日本，中日货物的交换依旧进行。中国商人携带的商品系锦、绫、香药、茶碗、文具等物，日本输出物品主要为砂金、水银、绵、绢、布和新发展的美术工艺品，如扇、屏风、螺钿、水晶细工、刀、剑等物。北宋东京（开封）相国寺的市场出卖着日本扇，宋代人赞赏扇上绘画说：“意思深远，笔势精妙。”欧阳修“日本刀歌”说：“宝刀近出日本国，越贾得之沧海东。”上述的其他工艺品也都受当时人的赞美。日本入宋僧人也备受优待。
    到了十二世纪后叶，日本统治者奖励商舶和南宋贸易，南宋也注意招致外国商船。开庆四明续志说“倭人冒鲸波之险，舳舻相衔，以其物来售”。同时南宋在明州欢迎日本来船，“支送酒食，举行燕犒”，备极优待。中日商船往来于明州（中国对日的主要贸易港）和博多（日本的贸易港）之间。贸易的频繁使宋代钱货盛行于日本。同时寄身商舶前来南宋的日本僧侣数目极多。南宋僧人也有许多前赴日本的。南宋特盛的禅宗不断传入日本。当时中国著名僧人的“语录”中常著录日本僧名。福州刻印各本大藏经传入日本，对日本印刷事业的发达予以极大的刺激。十三世纪初以朱熹为代表的南宋儒学传入日本。一二四七年日本有人托名“陋巷子”复刻宋椠本论语集注十卷，这是日本印刷中国儒书的开始。中国茶种和南宋人“吃茶”的风气，也经过禅僧盛传于日本。可见在南宋时期中日经济文化的交流也在继续增长。
    十三世纪后叶，元朝统治者和日本关系极端恶化，中国商舶绝迹于日本。但是日本商舶不断来到中国，一般说来都受到民间优厚的待遇。中日贸易仍占重要地位，日本也仍有许多僧人前来中国。嵩山少林寺留下有元时日僧古源邵元撰文的石碑。日本僧人在松江遇“巨水为害”，中国僧人念他“为异邦之人，苦留过冬，朅来七年，视以骨肉”。日本入元僧传中，还有许多类似的记载。
    明、清两代中、日文化、经济的密切联系，更是超越前时。在足利幕府时期，日本使臣从宁波直至北京。他们沿途在杭州、南京等处都进行贸易。除一般工业品外，日本输出大量的铜和硫磺。明代铜钱大量输入日本，促进了日本国内货币经济的发展。中国绘画和其他艺术品引起日本人民普遍的兴趣。大批中国商舶开到日本的贸易港长崎。清代康熙年间贸易更盛，中国商舶携至日本的商品，包括了十五省的许多物产。中国书籍大量输到日本，德川幕府在长崎设专官检阅进口图书，以精识中国版本的人充任。明、清两代留居长崎的中国人对日本文化也有很大的贡献。陈德明等人的医术，“长崎二妙”林道荣和高天漪的书法都深受日本人民的推重。应该特别提出的是坚持反抗满清统治的朱舜水，他在日本开创讲学的风气，日本学术界深受他的崇高的思想的薰陶。
    近代西方帝国主义侵入东方以后，中、日关系起了剧烈的变化。鸦片战争以后，中国陷入了半殖民地、半封建的深渊。日本学习西方较早较快，十九世纪的后三十年中，迅速地发展成为近代式的国家。当时中国的资产阶级改良主义者如康有为、梁启超等，曾经热烈学习日本的经验，以为可以找到拯救中国的道路。不久中国青年大批地到日本留学，日本自然科学和社会科学的著作也大量地译成中文。辛亥革命前后的“新学”，大部分是从日本介绍到中国，这使封建主义的“旧学”发生了一定程度的动摇。中国民主主义革命的伟大的先行者孙中山先生曾以日本为革命运动的根据地。他得到日本人民的同情和支持。中国人民开始学习马克思主义的经过，也同日本学术界对马克思学说的介绍有很大的关系。在二十世纪初年，中国的资产阶级革命民主主义者已经从日本书籍转介绍马克思恩格斯的生平及共产党宣言的要点。中国最早的共产主义者之一李大钊同志，在十月革命以前已经在日本接触了马克思主义。鲁迅早年在日本留学，后来他也曾从日文译著钻研马克思主义。中国早期译述的马克思主义的经典著作，其中多种是从日文转译而来的。日本的译著对于五四运动前后马克思主义在中国的传播，是有帮助的。
    两千年的历史说明了中、日两国除了在一些短时期中发生过战争以外，一直是和平共处的。其中有两次战争，也是最大的两次，发生在最近的六十年中。特别是后一次，由于日本军国主义者的滔天的罪行，使中国人民受到极凶恶的蹂躏，使日本人民遭受了痛苦的外国奴役，也使中日两国的正常的关系经过十年的岁月，到现在还没有恢复。
    一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以后，中国政府和人民曾对促进中日关系的正常化作了许多努力。中国人民对于日本人民要求和平、民主和国家独立的愿望是深为同情的。中国人民深知，一个没有外力控制的独立的民主的爱好和平的日本是亚洲和世界和平所不可缺少的因素。中日两国社会制度虽然不同，但是完全可以和平共处的。这正如周恩来总理最近在接见日本新闻界广播界访华代表团时所说：“我们一贯认为不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。尤其是中国和日本是近邻，几千年来有着长时期的和平友好相处的历史，其间只有少数年份不是这样。人们常爱说中日两国同文同种。照理，只要根据中国和印度两国总理联合声明中所提出的和平共处五项原则，或者说根据亚非会议的促进世界和平和合作的宣言中的十项原则，中日两国的关系就能够正常化，中日两国就能够达到真正的共存共荣。”
