    Over One Hundred Joint State-Private Shipping Companies Established
    To date, over 130 private shipping companies across the country have implemented joint state-private ownership. Along the coast, all private shipping companies possessing large vessels of 500 tons or more have joined the joint state-private ownership program. Along the main inland waterway, the Yangtze River, all original private shipping companies have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. The shipping industry on the Songhua River is entirely state-owned. The socialist transformation of private shipping companies undertaking transportation tasks on the Pearl River has also progressed rapidly this year. It is estimated that approximately 200 private shipping companies nationwide within the inland river transport system are currently organizing or will be organizing joint state-private ownership. Smaller coastal private shipping businesses will also gradually transition to joint state-private ownership.
    With the rapid advancement of the socialist transformation of private shipping, state-owned shipping's proportion, calculated by vessel tonnage, has increased from 46.6% in 1952 to over 55%. The proportion of joint state-private shipping has increased from 6.97% in 1952 to over 27%, while the proportion of private shipping has decreased from 46.43% in 1952 to 17%. If calculated by the actual volume of transportation undertaken, the growth rate of the socialist economic component is even faster. Currently, state-owned shipping undertakes approximately 70% of the total shipping tasks, private shipping less than 9%, and a portion of transportation tasks is borne by joint state-private shipping companies.

    合营轮船公司已有一百多家
    到现在为止，全国已有一百三十多家私营轮船公司实行了公私合营。在沿海，拥有五百吨以上的大型船舶的私营轮船公司都已参加公私合营；在主要内河航线长江沿线，原有的私营轮船公司已全部转变为公私合营；松花江上的轮船业全部是国营企业；担负珠江上运输任务的私营轮船公司的社会主义改造工作今年也进行得较快。预计，今年全国内河航运系统正在组织公私合营或将要组织公私合营的私营轮船业大约有二百多家；沿海较小的私营轮船业也将逐步转变为公私合营。
    随着私营轮船业的社会主义改造的迅速进行，按船舶的载重量计算，现在国营轮船业所占的比重已由一九五二年的百分之四十六点六增长为百分之五十五以上，公私合营轮船业所占的比重已由一九五二年的百分之六点九七增长为百分之二十七以上，私营轮船业所占的比重已由一九五二年的百分之四十六点四三下降为百分之十七。如按实际担负的运输量来计算，社会主义经济成份增长的速度还要快些。现在国营轮船业所担负的运输任务约占全部轮船业运输任务百分之七十，私营轮船业不到百分之九，还有一部分运输任务由公私合营的轮船业来负担。　（新华社）
