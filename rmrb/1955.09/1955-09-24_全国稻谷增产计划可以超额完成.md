Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: This year, early rice and mid-season rice have had mostly bumper harvests across the country and have been successively harvested; late rice has begun to head and ripen, and a bumper harvest is in sight. It is estimated that, with the exception of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, which have not fulfilled their planned targets due to drought, other provinces and cities can fulfill or overfulfill the state-stipulated increase production targets. The national total rice output plan, which requires an increase of 8.5 percent over 1954, can be overfulfilled.

This year's rice production increase is particularly significant in Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, and other provinces that suffered severe flooding in 1954. The early rice and mid-season rice in these provinces generally yielded around 400 jin per mu, with good yields reaching 600 to 700 jin. Anhui Province's early rice and mid-season rice production both increased by 30 to 40 percent compared to the bumper year of 1952. Hubei Province's early rice and mid-season rice production both increased by 10 to 20 percent compared to the bumper year of 1953, with early rice in the Jingjiang flood diversion area increasing by 20 to 30 percent compared to 1953. The per-mu yield of early rice in the Dongting Lake plain of Hunan Province increased by 10 to 20 percent compared to the bumper year of 1953, and with the expansion of planting area, the total output increased by nearly one time compared to 1953; the per-mu yield of mid-season rice also increased by about 10 percent compared to 1953. Sichuan Province, the province with the highest rice output, can increase production by nearly 10 percent compared to 1954. Although Guangdong and Guangxi provinces suffered severe droughts, many areas still achieved increased production. The early rice in the main rice-producing areas of Guangdong Province generally increased in production compared to 1954 or maintained the 1954 output. In Guangxi Province, except for the Rongxian Special District, the early rice in general areas slightly increased in production compared to 1954, and the early rice in the Baise Special District increased in production by about 20 percent compared to 1954. In addition, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other provinces have expanded the planting area of rice and upland rice, generally increasing production compared to 1954.

The further development of the agricultural cooperation movement in various regions, the implementation of the state's "Three Fixes" policy on grain, and the support from the state and people in other regions to farmers in the flood-stricken areas last year, have greatly promoted this year's rice production. Due to the active construction of water conservancy projects and increased accumulation of fertilizer, the area of paddy fields that were converted from single-season to double-season, from intercropping to continuous cropping, and from indica rice to japonica rice in the southern rice-producing areas increased by more than 8 million mu compared to last year; many drylands were also converted to paddy fields. The planting area of improved rice varieties in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces reached more than 67 million mu, a significant increase compared to 1954. Various regions have universally trained farmer-technicians, so that rice cultivation techniques have improved a step further than in previous years. Other factors that contributed to increased rice production were: fewer natural disasters this year than in previous years. The Yangtze River basin and the northern rice-producing areas generally had favorable weather. Although rice borers occurred earlier than in previous years, the prevention and control work in various regions was done well, so the damage was not great.

### 全国稻谷增产计划可以超额完成

    全国稻谷增产计划可以超额完成
    新华社二十三日讯　今年各地早稻、中稻大部丰收，现已先后收割完毕；晚稻已开始抽穗结实，丰收在望。据估计：除广东、广西两省受旱没有完成预定计划外，其他各省、市都可以完成或超额完成国家规定的增产任务。全国稻谷总产量要求比一九五四年增加百分之八点五的计划可以超额完成。
    今年水稻增产特别显著的，是一九五四年遭受大水的安徽、湖北、湖南、江苏等省。这些省份的早稻和中稻一般每亩收四百斤左右，好的收六、七百斤。安徽省的早稻和中稻都比丰收的一九五二年增产三、四成。湖北省的早稻和中稻都比丰收的一九五三年增产一、二成，荆江分洪区的早稻比一九五三年增产二、三成。湖南省洞庭湖滨平原的早稻单位面积产量比丰收的一九五三年增加一、二成，加上种植面积的扩大，总产量比一九五三年增加近一倍；中稻单位面积产量也比一九五三年增加一成左右。水稻产量最多的四川省可以比一九五四年增产近一成。广东、广西两省虽然受旱较重，但仍有不少地区获得增产。广东省主要水稻产区的早稻一般都比一九五四年增产，或保持一九五四年的产量。广西省除容县专区外，一般地区的早稻比一九五四年略有增产，百色专区的早稻比一九五四年增产二成左右。此外，河北、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等省扩大了水稻、陆稻的种植面积，普遍比一九五四年增产。
    各地农业合作化运动的进一步发展，国家粮食“三定”政策的贯彻，以及去年大水地区农民得到国家和其他地区人民的支援，对今年水稻生产起了极大的推动作用。由于积极兴修水利和增积肥料，南方水稻产区单季改双季、间作改连作、籼稻改粳稻的稻田比去年多八百多万亩；各地旱地改水田的也不少。四川、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、福建、江西、浙江、安徽、江苏十省水稻良种种植面积达六千七百多万亩，比一九五四年扩大很多。各地普遍训练农民技术员，使水稻耕作技术比往年提高了一步。其他促使水稻增产的因素是：今年自然灾害比往年少。长江流域和北方水稻产区一般都是风调雨顺。水稻螟虫虽然比往年发生较早，但是各地防治工作做得较好，因而危害不大。
