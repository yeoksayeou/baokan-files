    Eliminating Artificial Barriers to East-West Trade
    Su Xin
    World public opinion is pleased to welcome the instructions given by the recent Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference to the four foreign ministers. These instructions stipulate that the foreign ministers should take measures to develop contacts between East and West and eliminate barriers to peaceful trade. This fact powerfully illustrates that the objective requirements of world economic development cannot be resisted by human power; nor are the unremitting efforts of the people of all countries to develop normal international trade in recent years in vain.
    The Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries have consistently advocated the development of international peaceful trade. These countries believe that free trade and economic exchanges help the smooth development of the economies of all countries and the improvement of the welfare of the people; in particular, the development of such economic relations between countries with different social systems can promote mutual trust and international cooperation, thereby contributing to the consolidation of peace.
    On the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the foreign trade of the socialist camp countries has greatly developed. Last year, the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume increased threefold compared to the pre-war year of 1938, China's foreign trade volume doubled compared to 1950, and the European People's Democratic countries' foreign trade volume increased by 70 percent compared to 1948. These countries now maintain trade relations with dozens of capitalist countries in Europe, America, and Asia, and are prepared to continue to expand and strengthen these relations to the best of their ability.
    The Soviet Union, China, and Eastern European countries have historically formed traditional trade relations with capitalist countries. Before the war, trade with the countries currently included in the socialist camp accounted for about 10 percent of the total foreign trade of the United States, Britain, and France, and about 20 to 30 percent of the total foreign trade of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The frequent exchange of goods and mutual exchange of needs between these countries once constituted an important part of international trade.
    After the Second World War, many countries in Europe and Asia changed their political and social foundations and embarked on the path of independence and socialist construction. This situation should not have prevented them from continuing to maintain trade relations with Western capitalist countries, but would only have further promoted the development of such trade, because these countries, after the liberation of their productive forces, had a greater need and possibility than ever before to develop their economies and foreign trade. However, because the United States was pursuing goals that were diametrically opposed to consolidating peace and promoting international cooperation, it repeatedly set up artificial barriers on the road to developing East-West trade, which seriously hindered trade between the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries and Western countries, and even almost led to its temporary interruption. By 1951, trade between major capitalist countries and the socialist camp countries had sharply declined. Compared with pre-war levels, the United States was only at one-tenth, Britain at one-sixth, and France at one-quarter. Japan's trade with China in 1951 was less than 1 percent of Japan's total foreign trade, and Britain's trade with China in 1952 decreased by four-fifths compared to pre-war levels.
    The United States' purpose in implementing these discriminatory trade measures was twofold: on the one hand, to use it as a tool for promoting the Cold War and "strength policy," attempting to stifle and delay the economic development of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and weaken the strength of peaceful democratic countries; on the other hand, to further monopolize the capitalist world market, making the various capitalist countries more unilaterally dependent on the United States economically.
    But the facts of the past few years have proved that the United States has not achieved its goals.
    The fundamental reason for the failure of the U.S. economic blockade policy is that it completely ignored the objective laws of world economic development, and that the target of its blockade was a powerful socialist camp occupying one-fifth of the world's land and more than one-third of its population. The countries in this camp have abundant resources, a large labor force, a strong industrial base, and advanced technological levels. They have all the conditions to meet their needs for developing their economies and improving the living standards of their people. Blockades and embargoes not only cannot hinder the economic development of this camp, but have instead promoted closer economic cooperation among these countries, thereby promoting their economic development. It is the Western countries themselves that have suffered. For many capitalist countries, severing trade relations with the huge democratic world market is by no means a beneficial thing. They cannot but abandon the traditional markets where they could have sold large quantities of industrial products, abandon the convenience of purchasing important raw materials and food in non-dollar areas, and rely on the expensive U.S. market. This situation has led to a continuous increase in the trade deficit and dollar deficit of Western capitalist countries, production contraction, a decline in the living standards of the people, and thus affected the economic and social stability and financial consolidation of these countries.
    The growth of economic difficulties in capitalist countries and the intensification of struggles in the capitalist world market caused by the economic blockade have made the contradictions between many capitalist countries and the United States and among themselves more acute. At the same time, although U.S. monopoly capital has dumped its commodities, lowered raw material prices, and obtained huge profits through the embargo policy, the efforts of many Western European countries to resist imports in order to balance trade and make up for payment deficits have in turn affected U.S. exports. That is to say, the result of the economic blockade policy is not to weaken the socialist camp, but to weaken the strength of the entire capitalist world and exacerbate the general crisis of capitalism.
    Under such circumstances, the call for the development of East-West trade has continued to rise. People in many capitalist countries have begun to break through artificial barriers and seek ways to develop East-West trade. Since the Moscow International Economic Conference in 1952, there has been a trend of renewed development of trade between East and West. Especially when the signs of the U.S. economic crisis gradually became apparent in 1953, the business communities of many capitalist countries, including the United States, turned their attention to the markets of peaceful democratic countries.
    Thus, despite the fact that the U.S. ruling clique's discriminatory trade policy has not been completely eliminated, East-West trade has still developed to a certain extent in recent years.
    The easing of international tensions and the increase in mutual trust that have emerged since the Geneva Conference have opened up new prospects for the further development of East-West trade. Public opinion in many countries is eagerly hoping that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in October will take concrete measures in this regard to eliminate all remaining artificial barriers, so as to facilitate the development of East-West trade.
    But it should be pointed out that not everyone today is working towards the development of East-West trade. Although the U.S. embargo policy has been resolutely opposed by the people of all countries, and its Western allies have often expressed dissatisfaction, some people in the U.S. ruling clique still do not want to completely abandon this policy. Some people are even spreading arguments that are unfavorable to the development of East-West trade, saying that the peaceful democratic countries are seeking to develop East-West trade because of their own economic difficulties, and that there is no prospect for development in trading with these countries, and so on.
    It is certainly not helpful to deal with the issue of East-West trade with this attitude. Since past facts have proven that the discriminatory trade policy is an important factor in exacerbating international tensions, this situation should not be allowed to continue today. At the same time, only on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit can East-West trade be developed normally. The reason why peaceful democratic countries have consistently advocated the development of East-West trade is by no means due to their own economic difficulties. Soviet Premier Bulganin has pointed out: This is "not because the severance of normal economic and trade ties with the Soviet Union by certain countries has made the Soviet economy unbearable, and therefore it is necessary to restore this normal relationship." But "because there is a great opportunity to establish normal friendly relations between countries in this regard, and this can improve the welfare of the people of all countries, ease international tensions and strengthen trust between countries, leading to beneficial results." The situation is the same for China and the People's Democratic countries. The economies of peaceful democratic countries are developing smoothly, and the purchasing power of the people is increasing day by day. These countries do not have a crisis of overproduction, their markets are the most stable, and sales possibilities are constantly growing. The British "Export Trader and Shipper" wrote: "There is no basis for not allowing the vast land from the Vistula River to the China Sea to become a favorable market for British exports." The view that the markets of peaceful democratic countries can only export certain traditional export goods, and therefore have limited payment capacity, is now outdated. Facts have proven that with economic development, these countries have the potential to put more new products into the world market and supply the needs of various countries.
    It should be said that the possibilities for developing East-West trade are far from being utilized today. According to the "United Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics" last year, trade between Eastern and Western Europe can be increased at least twofold. China's trade with Western countries also has great prospects for development. The Geneva Conference has opened up a possible path for solving the problem of East-West trade, and what the people of all countries are asking for now is to move forward in this direction. The governments of the countries concerned should not only show sincerity, but more importantly, make joint efforts. Only by removing all artificial barriers and fully guaranteeing freedom of navigation on the high seas can East-West trade be truly developed.

    消除东西方贸易的人为障碍
    苏新
    世界舆论满意地欢迎不久以前举行的日内瓦四国政府首脑会议给予四国外长的指示，这个指示规定，外长们应该采取措施，发展东西方之间的接触并消除和平贸易的障碍。这一事实有力地说明，世界经济发展的客观要求，决不是人力所能抗拒的；各国人民这些年来争取发展国际正常贸易的不懈努力也不是徒然的。
    苏联、中国和各人民民主国家是一贯主张发展国际和平贸易的。这些国家认为，进行自由的贸易往来和经济交流，有助于各国经济的顺利发展和人民福利的增进；特别是在不同社会制度的国家之间发展这种经济关系，更能促进相互信任与国际合作，从而有利于和平的巩固。
    在平等互利和互相尊重主权完整的基础上，社会主义阵营国家的对外贸易已经有了很大的发展。去年，苏联的对外贸易额已比战前一九三八年增加了三倍，中国的对外贸易额比一九五○年增加了一倍，欧洲人民民主国家的对外贸易额比一九四八年增加了百分之七十。这些国家现在同欧洲、美洲和亚洲的好几十个资本主义国家维持着贸易关系，并且准备尽力继续扩大和加强这种关系。
    苏联、中国和东欧各国，过去同资本主义国家有着由历史所形成的传统的贸易关系。战前，同目前包括在社会主义阵营内的各个国家的贸易额，在美、英、法三国的对外贸易总额中曾占到百分之十左右，在德、意、日三国对外贸易总额中占到百分之二十到三十左右。这些国家之间的频繁的物资交流和互通有无，曾经构成了国际贸易的重要部分。
    第二次世界大战以后，欧洲和亚洲的许多国家改变了自己的政治与社会基础，走上了独立自主的和建设社会主义的道路。这种情形本来并不应该妨碍它们继续同西方资本主义国家保持贸易的关系，而只会更加促进这种贸易的发展，因为这些国家在生产力得到解放以后，比以前任何时候都有更大的必要与可能来发展自己的经济和对外贸易。但是，由于美国追求着同巩固和平与增进国际合作截然相反的目标，在开展东西方贸易的道路上一次又一次地设下了人为的栏栅，使得苏联、中国和人民民主国家同西方国家的贸易受到了严重的阻碍，甚至几乎一时陷于中断。到一九五一年的时候，主要资本主义国家同社会主义阵营各国的贸易急剧下降，如果和战前水平相比，那么美国只等于十分之一，英国—六分之一，法国—四分之一。日本对中国的贸易在一九五一年还不到日本对外贸易总额的百分之一，英国对中国的贸易在一九五二年比战前减少了五分之四。
    美国实施这种贸易歧视措施的目的有二：一方面用它来作为推行冷战和“实力政策”的工具，企图扼杀和延缓苏联和人民民主国家的经济发展，削弱和平民主国家的力量；另一方面想进一步垄断资本主义世界市场，使各个资本主义国家在经济上更加片面地依从美国。
    但是几年来的事实证明，美国并没有达到自己的目的。
    美国经济封锁政策失败的根本原因在于它完全忽略了世界经济发展的客观法则，而且它所封锁的对象又是一个占世界五分之一土地和三分之一以上人口的、强大的社会主义阵营。这个阵营里的国家有着丰富的资源，众多的人力，强大的工业基础和先进的技术水平。它们具有一切条件来满足自己发展经济和提高人民生活水平的需要。封锁禁运不但不能够阻碍这个阵营的经济发展，反而促成了这些国家在经济上更加紧密的合作，因而促进了它们经济的发展。受到损害的倒是西方国家自己。对于许多资本主义国家来说，同巨大的民主世界市场隔断贸易关系，决不是有利的事情。它们不能不放弃本来可以销售大量工业产品的传统市场，放弃在非美元区购买重要原料和食品的便利，而仰给于价格高昂的美国市场。这种情形使西方资本主义国家的贸易逆差和美元赤字不断增加，生产萎缩，人民生活水平下降，因而影响了这些国家的经济和社会稳定和财政巩固。
    由于经济封锁而造成的资本主义国家经济困难的增长和资本主义世界市场斗争的加剧，使得许多资本主义国家与美国间以及它们相互间的矛盾更加尖锐了。同时，虽然美国垄断资本藉禁运政策倾销了自己的商品，压低了原料价格，获取了巨额利润，但是许多西欧国家为了平衡贸易、弥补支付差额而实行的抵制入口的努力，反过来也影响了美国的出口。这就是说，经济封锁政策的结果不是削弱了社会主义阵营，而是削弱了整个资本主义世界的力量，加剧了资本主义的总危机。
    在这样的情况之下，要求发展东西方贸易的呼声也就不断高涨起来。许多资本主义国家的人士开始冲破人为的障碍，寻求发展东西方贸易的道路。自从一九五二年莫斯科国际经济会议以后，东西方之间的贸易有了重新发展的趋势。特别是在一九五三年美国经济危机的征兆逐渐明显的时候，包括美国在内的许多资本主义国家的工商界更把目光转向和平民主国家的市场。
    这样，尽管美国统治集团的贸易歧视政策并未完全消除，东西方之间的贸易近年来仍然有了一定的发展。
    日内瓦会议以后所出现的国际紧张局势的缓和，相互信任气氛的增长，为进一步发展东西方贸易开辟了新的前景。许多国家的舆论都热望将在十月召开的四国外长会议在这方面采取具体措施，消除尚存的一切人为障碍，以利东西方贸易的发展。
    但是应该指出，今天并不是所有的人都在朝着发展东西方贸易的方向努力的。虽然美国的禁运政策已经遭到各国人民的坚决反对，它的西方盟国也时常表示不满，但是美国统治集团中的某些人士，现在还不想完全抛弃这种政策。有些人甚至还在散布着一些不利于东西方贸易发展的论调，说什么和平民主国家的谋求发展东西方贸易是由于它们本身的经济困难，同这些国家进行贸易没有什么发展前途，等等。
    用这种态度来对待东西方贸易问题，当然是于事无补的。过去的事实既已证明贸易歧视政策是加剧国际紧张局势的一个重要因素，今天就不应该再让这种情形继续下去。同时，也只有在互相尊重主权和平等互利的基础上，东西方之间的贸易才能得到正常的发展。和平民主国家之所以一贯主张发展东西方贸易，决不是由于它们本身的经济困难。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁已经指出：这“并不是因为某些国家同苏联断绝了正常的经济和贸易联系已经使苏联的经济受不住，因而非要恢复这种正常联系不可。”而“是因为在这方面建立国家间的正常友好关系的机会很大，而且这可以改善各国人民的福利，缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的信任，导致有利的成果”。对于中国和各人民民主国家来说，情形也是相同的。和平民主国家的经济正在顺利发展，人民的购买力日益提高。这些国家没有生产过剩的危机，它们的市场是最稳定的，销售可能性是在不断增长的。英国“出口贸易与运输商杂志”就这样写道：“不让从维斯杜拉河到中国海的大片土地成为英国出口业的有利市场，是没有任何根据的”。那种认为和平民主国家市场只能输出某几种传统的出口物资，因而支付能力有限的观点，现在也已经过时了。事实证明，随着经济的发展，这些国家有可能把更多的新的产品投入世界市场，供应各国的需要。
    应该说，发展东西方贸易的可能性今天还远未加以利用。据“联合国每月统计月报”去年的统计，东西欧之间的贸易至少还可以增加两倍。中国同西方国家的贸易也有很大的发展前途。日内瓦会议已为解决东西方贸易的问题打开了可能的道路，现在各国人民所要求的就是循着这个方向前进。各有关国家的政府不仅应该表现诚意，更重要的是进行共同的努力。只有取消一切人为的障碍，完全保障公海航行自由，东西方之间的贸易才能得到真正的发展。
