    The Creation of the Brake Tester
    By our reporter, Fu Dong

    The meeting had been over for hours, but Wu Zhenhua's mind was still uneasy. He walked back and forth in the repair shop, recalling the scene from the meeting just now.

    This was a day in June of 1954. The Beijing Automobile Transportation Company held a symposium to study the new targets proposed by the Ministry of Communications' automobile technology conference. Drivers and maintenance workers attended the meeting. A driver representative spoke, saying: "We drivers have no problem completing our tasks. The problem is that the maintenance workers spend too much time repairing brakes, sometimes several days. Who should be responsible for this?" The maintenance worker, Wu Zhenhua, felt really bad when he heard this. This had happened more than once. Whenever brakes needed repair, drivers would sarcastically say: "Our car has gone to grandma's house again, and we won't hear from it until it feels like coming out." Wu Zhenhua understood the drivers' anxiety. But what could he do? Maintenance workers sometimes wouldn't even rest at noon in order to rush the work, and they often worked late into the night. But they just couldn't rush it; they couldn't hand over a car with faulty brakes. Wu Zhenhua still remembered a recent tragedy clearly. Not long ago, a driver from the company was driving a large truck full of sand and gravel into the city when, as the truck was turning onto Rongxian Hutong, he suddenly saw a child running across the road. The driver quickly slammed on the brakes, but the brakes failed, and a living child was crushed to death by the truck. The driver was also punished. "Faulty brakes are a death trap." Wu Zhenhua deeply felt this, so every time he repaired the brakes, he was always uneasy. He would test the car once, and if it wasn't good enough, he would take it apart and repair it again. After repairing it, he would put the wheels back on and drive to the suburbs to test the car again. He would test it like this again and again, sometimes for ten consecutive days.

    One day, he was about to go out to test the brakes again. He drove the car to a deserted place seven or eight kilometers outside Xibianmen to test the car. He concentrated, accelerated, and drove at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. As he was driving well, he suddenly slammed on the brakes. The car stopped immediately with a "squeak." He jumped out of the car to look at the marks left by the tires on the ground. He saw that it didn't meet the standards. He thought: This time was wasted again. He would have to take the tires apart and repair them again, and after repairing them, he would have to come back and "drag the prints" again. This kind of testing not only wasted time and affected the task, but also wasted tires and damaged the car's mechanisms. Each time, it also consumed three or four gallons of gasoline. Whenever he thought of gasoline, Wu Zhenhua felt heartache. Gasoline was such a precious thing! People say that oil is the "blood of industry," and that's absolutely true. But how difficult it is to extract oil! He remembered the difficult conditions of extracting oil at the Yumen Oilfield that he had seen in a movie. He also remembered the long journey of transporting oil from Yumen to all parts of the country. What impressed him most was the report given by the delegation of returning volunteers in 1953. They said that the soldiers at the front, even in the most difficult days, had never forgotten to save every drop of gasoline to support the country's industrial construction. "The soldiers are so thrifty, but we are wasting gasoline here. How can we be worthy of the people?" he asked himself.

    Could he think of a way to test the car in the workshop after repairing the brakes, without going out? Wouldn't that save a lot of gasoline? He pondered over the machine all day long. He thought about it while eating, and he thought about it in bed at night. His brain ached, but he couldn't come up with a good idea. He asked himself: "Is it true that, as everyone often says, when people who work on machines use their brains and find a trick, they can suddenly produce ten times, a hundred times, or even several hundred times more things, while car repairers can only disassemble and assemble, and no matter how much their hands change, they can't repair ten cars at once?"

    No, that's not the case. He thought that his own work could answer this question. Didn't the new brake lining and vertical shaft that he improved a year ago solve a major problem in car repair? It was clear that there were tricks everywhere, as long as you put your mind to it.

    The idea of making a machine to test brakes circled in his mind all day long.

    The branch secretary also often encouraged him, saying: "Old Wu, the problem of testing brakes is key to our company. You should think of more ways."

    One night, he lay in bed thinking about this problem again, and he couldn't fall asleep no matter what. He suddenly thought that if he jacked up the car, so that the wheels were suspended in the air, and started the engine, and then stepped on the brakes, he could see which wheel stopped first and which stopped later, and wouldn't that tell him whether the brakes were working or not? Once he understood this, he felt an unspeakable joy. But then he thought, what if he blurted it out and let everyone know, but he couldn't make it work? Wouldn't that be embarrassing? He might as well try it secretly first. So, during the lunch break the next day, he found a No. 5070 "International" car and tried it himself. As a result, he found that one wheel stopped first and the other stopped later. He thought that the car's brakes must have a problem, they must be "off-center." To confirm his judgment, he drove the car to the road to test it. But strangely, the car didn't "pull" on the road. What was going on? He was really puzzled, so he stopped the car and carefully checked it. As a result, he found that there was a problem with the toe-in. This meant that no matter how well the brakes worked, as long as you stepped on the brakes, one wheel would stop first and the other would stop later. Thinking further, this kind of testing might not be effective. Because the car has a kind of inertia when it runs on the ground, but now the wheels are spinning in the air, and they are not bearing the weight of the car. The two situations are different, so there is no way to test whether the brakes are working or not.

    Soon, the company held a symposium of labor models and advanced producers to study the issue of reducing costs and freight rates. The company leaders kindly said to him at the meeting: "Solving the brake problem is one of the keys to reducing costs. Comrade Wu Zhenhua, how is your machine coming along? Talk to everyone about it."

    To be honest, Wu Zhenhua was more anxious than anyone else. Every day, when he went to and from work or drove out to test the car, when he passed some construction sites, he would think: "They may be waiting for cement and steel bars here, but because I can't fix the brakes, there are no cars to deliver the materials, delaying the progress of the project." This almost became a problem in his heart. Whenever he thought of this, he felt an unspeakable sadness.

    On Sundays, when he was supposed to be resting, Wu Zhenhua had no mood to play. He ran to the nearby cultural center to look through books and newspapers, trying to find a solution. He thought about this problem all day long, so that he couldn't eat or sleep well. His family worriedly asked him: "Why are you always spacing out? Are you sick?" One day, he was about to go out to test the brakes. He was sitting on the driver's seat of the car, waiting for the apprentice to crank the engine. His eyes were looking at the glass window, but his mind was thinking about the machine. He didn't pay attention to the apprentice's efforts to crank the engine. The apprentice cranked it more than twenty times, but the car didn't make a sound. He cranked it a few more times, but it was still the same. The young apprentice was so tired that he was out of breath. He opened the car door and looked at him with a suspicious look, saying: "Master Wu, did you turn on the ignition? Why can't I start the engine?" He was startled by these words. He checked and found that the ignition was indeed not turned on. On his way home from work, he kept thinking about this on the bus. One day on the bus, he suddenly thought that in the past, when repairing brakes, he often used a lever to jam on the steel plate and check the gap of the brake lining by hand. He thought, could he use something to replace his hand to test it? He thought of the "jack" (lifting machine), which could lift the car, but just using the "jack" couldn't show the size of the torque. How could he show the size of the torque? He thought and thought, but couldn't come up with a solution. As he was thinking, he forgot where he was going. When he came to his senses, he realized that he had missed three stops and had to walk back.

    One day, he suddenly saw a pressure gauge on the pressure machine in the repair shop. A thought flashed in his mind: "If I install a 'pressure gauge' or 'oil pressure gauge' on the 'jack,' wouldn't I be able to measure the size of the torque?" He immediately told his idea to the workshop director Liu Xuqi and the technician Liu Xiaoyou. They supported him very much and immediately notified the supply department to buy an oil pressure gauge. Liu Xiaoyou also suggested using the waste "center shaft" of a "40 Toyota" car as a lever. He remembered what the leaders often said, "Talk to everyone about things." So he ran to find the old workers Zhang Jingyi and Liu Guoxian. They said that distance marks could be drawn on the lever. In this way, it only took a day or two to prepare the tools.

    The experiment began. It was really effective. When testing a wheel with responsive brakes, the reading on the oil pressure gauge was high; the reading on a wheel that was not normal was low. This proved that the torque was being measured. He breathed a sigh of relief and felt that he was slowly getting the hang of it, but the problem was not completely solved. The torque readings of the four wheels were too far apart. Why was the difference so big? He couldn't figure it out. He talked to everyone, but everyone couldn't figure it out either. One day, as he was stepping on the brakes again and again, a comrade suddenly said to Wu Zhenhua: "I think the problem is with your feet. How can your strength be so even every time you step on the brakes? The force you use is different each time, so of course the torque of the car will be different." This sentence enlightened him.

    What could he use to step on the brakes so that the force would be fixed? He spent a long time thinking of a hand-cranked lifting machine to step on the brakes.

    He tested seven or eight cars in a row, and they were all very effective. The brake tester was a success.

    Previously, it took three or four gallons of gasoline to test a car; now, it only takes half a gallon. The time to repair brakes has been reduced from a maximum of eleven days to a maximum of one day. Maintenance workers no longer have to worry about not being able to test cars on windy, rainy, or snowy days.

    The news of the success of the brake tester quickly spread. Maintenance workers in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xinjiang, and other places wrote letters asking for drawings.

    Wu Zhenhua was named a model industrial worker in Beijing in 1954 and a first-class national highway transportation labor model. He gloriously participated in the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference.

    刹车试验器的产生
    本报记者　傅冬
    会已经开完好几个钟头了，但是吴振华的心还安不下来，他在修理车间里走来走去，回忆着刚才会上的情景。
    这是一九五四年六月的一天。北京市汽车运输公司召开了一个座谈会，研究交通部汽车技术会议提出的新的指标。参加这个会的有司机也有保养工。一个司机代表发言说：“我们司机完成任务是没有问题的。问题是保养工修刹车花的时间太多了，一修就是几天。这责任该算谁的？”保养工吴振华听了，心里真不是滋味。这样的事碰到不止一次了。一修刹车，司机就来挖苦：“我们的汽车又去住姥姥家了，一去就没信儿，什么时候高兴出来才出来。”司机这份焦急劲儿吴振华是了解的。可是有什么办法呢？保养工为了赶活，有时中午都不肯歇气，夜里赶活的时候也不少。可就是赶不好，刹车修不好是不能随便交差的。吴振华还清清楚楚地记得最近发生的一件惨事。不多天以前，公司一个司机开着一辆载满沙石的大卡车驶进城里，当车子正驶到绒线胡同拐弯的地方，忽然发现一个小孩横穿过马路。司机赶紧使劲踩刹车，可是刹车不灵，一个活生生的孩子就这样被车子压死了，司机也受到了处分。“刹车不灵，出去就是玩命。”吴振华深深体会到这一点，所以每次修好了刹车，他总是不放心。试了一次车，不行，回来拆了再修，修好了，把轮子上上，又开到郊外去试车。这样试一次又一次，有时得一连试十几天。
    这一天又该出去试刹车了，他开着车子到西便门外七、八公里没人的地方去试车。他集中精力，开足马力，用一点钟三十公里的速度开着车，正跑得好好的，他突然一踩刹车，车子“喳”的一声马上停住了。他跳下车来看轮胎在地上留下的印子，一看不合格，他想：这一次又算白费了。回去又得把轮胎拆了重修，修好了，还得再来一次“拖印子”，这样试车，耽搁了时间，影响了任务不说，又费轮胎又损害汽车机件，每次还得消耗三、四加仑汽油。一想起汽油，吴振华就心痛。汽油这东西可真是宝贵呀！人家说石油是“工业的血液”，这话可一点不假；但开采石油多么困难呵！他想起在电影里看到的开采玉门石油矿的艰苦情况；他又想起石油从玉门运到全国各地的漫长路程。给他印象最深的是一九五三年志愿军归国代表团所作的报告，他们说前方的战士，在最最艰难的日子里都没有忘记把汽油一滴一滴节省下来，支援祖国的工业建设。“战士们这样节约，而我们却在这里白白浪费汽油，这对得起人民吗？”他问自己。
    能不能想个法儿，修好了刹车，不出门，在车间里就把车试了，这样不是可以省很多汽油？他整天盘算机器的事儿。吃饭时想，夜里躺在床上也想，脑子都绞痛了，也想不出个好主意。他问自己：“是不是真像大伙常说的，人家搞机器的一动脑子，找了个窍门，一下子就可以多生产出十倍、一百倍甚至几百倍的东西，修汽车的就只能拆拆上上，一双手再变也不能一下子修十个汽车？”
    不，不是这样，他想自己的工作就可以回答这个问题。一年前自己改进的新制动带和立人轴不是解决了修车上的很大问题吗？可见不管那儿都有窍门，只要用心思就行。
    搞个试验刹车的机器这想法整天在他脑子里兜圈子。
    团支部书记也常常给他打气说：“老吴，试验刹车的问题是咱们公司的关键，你应当多想点办法。”
    有一天晚上，他躺在床上又想这个问题，想来想去怎么也睡不着。他忽然想到假如把汽车顶起来，轮子悬空，发动机器后，踩一下刹车，看看那个轮子先停，那个后停，不就可以知道刹车灵不灵？想通了，心里有说不出的痛快。可是反过来一想，要是先嚷嚷出去，叫大伙都知道信儿，而自己作不好，那多丢人呀！不如先偷偷地试一试。于是在第二天中午休息的时候，他找了个五○七○号“万国车”一个人试。结果发现一个轮子先停，一个后停。他想这车子刹车一定有毛病，一定“跑偏”，为了证实他的判断，他把车子开到马路上去试。可是真怪，车子在马路上却不“跑偏”。这又是怎么回事？他真纳闷，于是就把车停下来仔仔细细地检查，结果发现八字轮有毛病，这样不管刹车灵不灵，只要一踩刹车，都是一个轮子先停，一个后停。再往深处一想，这样试是不一定顶事的。因为车子在地上跑时有一种惰力，现在车轮悬空转，又没承受车身的重量，两种情况不一样，没法试出刹车灵不灵。
    不久，公司召开劳动模范和先进生产者座谈会，研究降低成本运价问题。公司的领导人员在会上亲切地对他说：“解决刹车问题是降低成本的关键之一，吴振华同志，你的机器搞得怎样了？多找大伙一块商量商量。”
    说真的，吴振华的心里比谁都着急。每天早晚上下班或者出去试车走过一些建筑工地时，他心里就想：“这里也许等着要用水泥钢筋，因为我修不好刹车，没车子送料，耽搁了工程的进展。”这几乎成了他心里的一块病，想到这，他心里就有说不出的难过。
    星期天该休息的时候，吴振华都没心思去玩。他跑到附近的文化馆里去翻书翻报，想寻出个门道来。他整天寻思这问题，弄得饭吃不下，觉睡不好，家里人担心地问他：“你为什么老发愣，是不是病了？”有一天他又要去试刹车，他坐在汽车司机台上等学徒摇车发火。他眼睛望着玻璃窗，脑子却在琢磨机器的事儿，一点没注意学徒发火的情况。学徒使劲摇了二十多转，车子一点没声气，又摇了几转，还是一样。小学徒累得上气不接下气，拉开车门，用怀疑的眼光望着他说：“吴师傅，你看电门开了没有？怎么老发不了火？”他听了这话，才惊醒，一检查果然电门没开。下班回家坐在公共汽车上他也寻思这事。有一天他在车上忽然想到过去修刹车时，常用一根杠杆卡在钢板上，用手搬着检查制动带间隙。他想是不是可以用一个东西代替手来试呢？他想起“千斤”（起高机）是可以顶起车来，但是光用“千斤”来顶，还看不出扭力的大小。怎样才能看出扭力大小呢？左思右想，想不出个法儿来。这样想着想着，忘记自己走在那儿了。等到他清醒过来，才发觉已经坐过了三站路，只好往回走。
    一天他在修配车间压力机上忽然看见个压力表。他脑子一闪，想到：“假如在‘千斤’上安个‘气表’或‘油压表’不就可以量出扭力大小吗？”他立即把自己的想法告诉车间主任刘旭祺和技术员刘孝友。他们很支持他，并且马上通知供应科买油压表，刘孝友还建议用“四○丰田”车的废“通心轴”作杠杆。他想起领导上常讲的“有事多找大伙商量”的话，于是又跑去找老工人张静一、刘国贤，他们说可以在杠杆上划出一定的距离标志。这样只用了一两天的功夫，就把工具备齐了。
    开始试验。真得劲，试刹车灵的轮子时，油压表上的磅数多，不正常的轮子磅数少，这证明扭力是量出来了。他松了口气，觉得慢慢摸到点门路了，可是问题并没有完全解决，四个轮子扭力的磅数相差得太远。为什么差那么多？他想不通，找大伙商量，大伙也想不通。有一天他正一次又一次踩刹车时，突然有一个同志对吴振华说：“我看毛病出在你的脚上，你每次踩刹车时力量那有那么匀，你每次用的劲儿不一样，当然车子的扭力大小就不一样了。”这句话点破了他。
    用个什么东西踩刹车才能使劲儿固定不变呢？他用了很长时间想出了一个手摇起高机来踩刹车。
    他连着试了七、八辆车，都很灵验。刹车试验器成功了。
    早先试一部车要耗费三、四加仑汽油，现在只要半加仑就可以了。修刹车的时间由最多十一天减到最多一天。保养工再不用发愁刮风下雨下雪天不能试车了。
    刹车试验器成功的消息很快地传出去了。上海、广州、沈阳、新疆等地的保养工都写信来要图。
    吴振华被评为一九五四年北京市的工业劳动模范和全国公路运输一等劳动模范。这次光荣地参加了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
