Xinhua News Agency, August 31st. The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Chinese Islamic Association jointly held a banquet on the evening of August 31st to welcome the Tunisian Friendship Delegation to China, headed by Mr. Ben Aleya.

At the banquet, Liu Guan-yi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, said in his speech: "You are the first peaceful and friendly delegation from a North African country to visit China since the founding of New China. Your arrival in New China marks a new development in the friendly contact between the Tunisian people and the Chinese people. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and support the struggle of the Tunisian people and the people of other North African countries to defend peace and strive for national independence." He also wished that the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Tunisian people would be strengthened and developed day by day.

Ben Aleya, head of the Tunisian Friendship Delegation to China, then delivered a speech, saying that although this was the first contact between the delegation and the Chinese people, "we have both fought against colonialism, so there has been a deep friendship between us for a long time." He said: "The Chinese people have waged arduous struggles to defend and build their country, and the Tunisian people have also struggled for peace and national independence. We believe that the Tunisian people's struggle will surely receive the brotherly support of the Chinese people." He added: "The Chinese people have made great contributions to the cause of peace. This direct contact has given us a deeper understanding of the Chinese people in this regard."

Present at tonight's banquet were leaders from the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Chinese Islamic Association, the Chinese Islamic Cultural Advancement Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the China Political Science and Law Society, as well as well-known Chinese social activists, university professors, agronomists, medical scientists, Muslims, experts on international trade issues, trade union workers, youth workers, educators, and journalists.
