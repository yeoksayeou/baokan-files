In his speech, Xiao Ke first represented the government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, expressing sincere gratitude to the heroic Soviet army for helping the Chinese people liberate the Northeast region, and expressing the highest respect and greatest honor to the Soviet soldiers who heroically sacrificed themselves in the heroic battles. Xiao Ke said: Ten years ago, when the Soviet army crushed the military forces of fascist Germany, it immediately turned its troops eastward and annihilated the main force of Japanese imperialism that had invaded our Northeast, the Kwantung Army, liberated our Northeast region, and decisively helped our people achieve the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In carrying out this sacred mission, the Soviet army demonstrated a great spirit of internationalism and a heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, and established outstanding meritorious service. The Chinese people will always have infinite gratitude and sincere love for the great Soviet people and the heroic and invincible Soviet army, and thank them for their great assistance to our country in the struggle to defeat Japanese imperialism and in the cause of the Chinese people's liberation! Xiao Ke said: Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the achievements of every construction cause of our people have been inseparable from the fraternal help of the Soviet Union. The fraternal friendship and close unity of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union are a reliable guarantee for safeguarding the security of the two countries, maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and a solid foundation for the happy life of the two peoples.

Soviet Consul General in Dalian, Belanov, spoke next. He first expressed his brotherly heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Soviet people to the government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said: In 1945, the Soviet armed forces crushed the main force of Japanese imperialism—the Kwantung Army—and helped the Chinese people win the final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. This victory guaranteed the victory of the great Chinese people's liberation struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and its foreign masters. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are advancing with full confidence along the road of building socialism, and they are winning one victory after another in the cause of restoring the national economy and defending world peace. The Soviet people are extremely excited about the outstanding achievements of their brothers and allies, the Chinese people, and sincerely wish them greater achievements in the construction of their great motherland. Belanov said: The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people, forged in the struggle against a common enemy, is a great and invincible force, and this force is having an increasing impact on resolving international issues related to the interests of all mankind and world peace.

Major General Shmelev, representative of the Soviet Far East Command, also spoke at the meeting. He first expressed warm and sincere gratitude on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Soviet Far East Military District to the people present and, through them, to the great Chinese people.

The Soviet soldiers will never forget the friendship, love, and meticulous care given to them by the Chinese people during their stay in the Lushunkou area. He concluded by saying: Let this solemn Victory Memorial Tower become a symbol of the eternal and unbreakable friendship between our two peoples.
