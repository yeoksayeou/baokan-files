Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to appropriately expand the scale of construction in the latter two years of the First Five-Year Plan. That is, in addition to the original tasks, new mines with a total production capacity of seven million to eight million tons will be newly built, and several coal washing plants will be newly built and renovated.

This decision was announced at the Third National Coal Mine Capital Construction Conference held from August 25 to September 4.

The conference studied in detail the guiding principles, tasks, and current basic situation of coal industry construction in the First Five-Year Plan. It was agreed that in the past two and a half years, coal mine construction has made many achievements. Dozens of pairs of mines have been handed over to production. With the growth of geological, design, and construction forces, more than one hundred construction projects will be under construction simultaneously by the end of this year. These have created favorable conditions for completing the First Five-Year Plan. However, because the coal industry did not fully complete the national construction plan in the past two and a half years, especially in 1953, due to insufficient understanding of the long-term and complex nature of coal mine construction, no new mines were built, which delayed the time for many mines to be handed over to production. This has increased the construction tasks for the next two years. According to statistics, in the latter two years of the Five-Year Plan, the coal industry must also complete 47.2 percent of the total investment; the total production capacity of newly built mines in the latter two years exceeds that of the previous three years. Recently, due to the rapid development of industry and transportation, especially in order to supply the large amount of coal required after a large number of key projects are put into production in the initial stage of the Second Five-Year Plan and the washed and selected fine coal required by the steel industry, it has been decided to increase new construction tasks in the latter two annual plans. Therefore, the basic construction task of the coal industry in the next two years is very heavy.

During the meeting, representatives from geology, design, construction, and other aspects conducted separate discussions and studied in detail the specific measures to ensure the completion of this arduous task.

The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to fully exploit the potential strength of coal mine construction in all aspects. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen geological exploration work so that the mine construction plan is based on a reliable foundation. The main measures in this regard are to vigorously carry out coalfield prospecting and detailed survey work, improve exploration quality, and strengthen hydrogeology, coal quality sampling and testing, and the preparation of geological reports. In terms of design, in addition to the need to increase some technical personnel, the more important thing is to continue to give full play to the existing design forces. To this end, coal mine design institutions across the country will be uniformly adjusted according to the principle of professional division of labor, and classification design and standard design will be implemented to improve design efficiency; it is necessary to further implement the guiding principles and policies of coal mine construction and do a good job in design budgets to save funds. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the organization and management of design institutions, improve design quality, and do a good job in collecting information on foreign-designed engineering projects to ensure the smooth progress of key projects.

The meeting also emphasized that doing a good job in pre-construction preparation is an important guarantee for the smooth start of the mine and accelerating the progress. In order to accelerate the construction progress and ensure the quality of the project at the same time, the meeting pointed out that various advanced experiences should be promoted, labor organization should be improved, the equipment utilization rate of construction machinery should be improved, quality education for employees should be strengthened, a responsibility system should be established, and supervision and inspection of project quality should be done well.

The meeting also discussed the supply of materials for basic construction, strengthening the training of technical personnel, and focused on studying the specific measures to ensure the completion of the 1955 construction tasks and saving funds plan.

### 煤炭工业将增加新的建设项目

    煤炭工业将增加新的建设项目
    新华社六日讯　煤炭工业部已确定在第一个五年计划的后两个年度计划中适当扩大建设规模，即在原定任务外，再增建生产能力共七百万吨到八百万吨的新矿井，同时增建和改建若干洗煤厂。
    这个决定是在八月二十五日到九月四日举行的全国煤矿第三次基本建设会议上宣布的。
    这次会议详细地研究了第一个五年计划中煤炭工业建设的方针任务和目前基本情况，认为在过去两年半中，煤矿建设已经有了许多成绩，有几十对矿井已移交生产，随着地质、设计和施工力量的增长，到今年年底为止将有一百多处建设工程同时进行施工。这些都为完成第一个五年计划创造了有利条件。但是，由于过去两年半中煤炭工业没有全面地完成国家建设计划，特别是一九五三年由于对煤矿建设的长期性复杂性认识不足，没有兴建一对新矿井，使许多矿井推迟了移交生产的时间，这就加重了今后两年的建设任务。据统计，五年计划的后两年，煤炭工业还必须完成投资总额的百分之四十七点二；后两年新建矿井总的生产能力超过了前三年。最近，由于工业和运输业的迅速发展，特别是为了供应第二个五年计划初期大批重点工程投入生产后所需的大量煤炭和钢铁工业所需的洗选精煤，又决定在后两个年度计划中增加新的建设任务。因此，煤炭工业今后两年多的基本建设任务是很繁重的。
    会议期间，到会的地质、设计、施工等各方面的代表曾分别进行讨论，详细研究了保证完成这一繁重任务的具体措施。
    会议强调指出，必须从各方面充分地发挥煤矿建设的潜在力量。首先必须加强地质勘探工作，使建井计划建立在可靠的基础之上。这方面的主要措施，是要大力开展煤田的普查和详查工作，提高勘探质量，并加强水文地质、煤质采样化验和地质报告的编制等工作。在设计方面，除需要增加一部分技术人员外，更重要的是要继续充分发挥现有的设计力量。为此，全国各地的煤矿设计机构，都将要按专业分工的原则统一调整，并推行分类设计和标准设计，以提高设计效率；要进一步贯彻煤矿建设的方针政策和做好设计预算，以节约资金。同时要加强设计机构的组织管理，提高设计质量，并做好国外设计的工程项目的资料搜集工作，以保证重点工程的顺利进行。
    会议同时强调了作好施工前的准备工作，是使矿井顺利开工和加快进度的重要保证。为了加速施工进度，同时保证工程质量，会议指出应该推广各种先进经验，改进劳动组织，提高施工机械的设备利用率，加强对职工的质量教育，建立责任制度，做好对工程质量的监督检查工作。
    会议还讨论了基本建设的物资供应、加强技术力量的培养等问题，并着重研究了保证完成一九五五年建设任务和节约资金计划的具体措施。
