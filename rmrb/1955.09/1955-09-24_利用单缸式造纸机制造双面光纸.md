    Using a Yankee Paper Machine to Manufacture Double-Sided Glossy Paper
    Bai Ting
    Since Liberation, with the rapid development of China's cultural undertakings, the demand for double-sided glossy paper has greatly increased. However, the majority of existing paper-making equipment in the country is Yankee cylinder paper machines suitable for manufacturing single-sided glossy paper. Therefore, a situation has arisen in the production and sales of paper: on the one hand, single-sided glossy paper is heavily overstocked, and the production tasks of Yankee paper machines are insufficient; on the other hand, the supply of double-sided glossy paper is tight, and the production of multi-cylinder paper machines cannot keep up with demand.
    In order to solve the contradiction of imbalance between production and sales and ensure the supply of paper for cultural purposes, the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry and local industrial departments have successively modified existing Yankee paper machines in the state-owned Jinzhou Paper Mill, the local state-owned Yanjing Paper Mill, and the joint state-private Zhonghe Paper Mill, etc., in order to produce medium or low-grade printing paper and book paper similar to double-sided glossy paper. The experimental results prove that the double-sided glossy paper for letterpress printing produced in this way can completely replace the double-sided glossy paper manufactured by multi-cylinder paper machines.
    Using the method of modifying old equipment to produce double-sided glossy paper can unleash the potential of existing equipment in light industry and solve the problem of production and sales balance of cultural paper. It can also relatively reduce the burden of multi-cylinder Fourdrinier machines in producing ordinary printing paper, allowing them to produce more high-grade printing paper and special industrial paper to meet the needs of national construction.
    When local paper mills improve existing equipment to produce double-sided glossy paper, they must conduct overall planning in an organized and led manner according to the principle of production and sales balance, in order to avoid the phenomenon of blindly modifying existing equipment.

    利用单缸式造纸机制造双面光纸
    百汀
    解放以来，由于我国文化事业的迅速发展，双面光纸的需要量大大增加，但国内现有的造纸设备绝大部分是适于制造单面光纸张的单缸式圆网造纸机，因此在纸张的产销上就发生了这样一种情况：一方面是单面光纸张大量积压，单缸式造纸机生产任务不足；另一方面是双面光纸张供应紧张，多缸式造纸机的生产赶不上需要。
    为了解决产销不平衡的矛盾，保证文化用纸的供应，轻工业部造纸工业管理局和地方工业部先后在国营锦州造纸厂、地方国营燕京造纸厂和公私合营中和造纸厂等厂改装了现有的单缸式造纸机，以便生产同双面光纸相近的中级或低级印刷纸和书籍纸。试验结果证明，所生产的凸版印刷等双面光纸完全可以代替用多缸式造纸机制造出来的双面光纸。
    用改装旧设备的办法生产双面光纸可以发挥轻工业现有设备的潜力，解决文化用纸的产销平衡问题；还可以相对减轻多缸式长网机生产普通印刷纸的负担，使之多生产高级印刷纸和工业特殊用纸，以满足国家建设的需要。
    各地造纸工厂在改进现有设备生产双面光纸时，必须有组织有领导地根据产销平衡的原则，进行全面安排，以免发生盲目改装现有设备的现象。
