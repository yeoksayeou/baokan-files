    Promoting the Fine Wheat Variety "Bi Ma No. 1"
    Li Meisen
    The "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat is a hybrid variety successfully cultivated by Professor Zhao Hongzhang of Northwest Agricultural College in 1947. By 1955, the planting area of this fine wheat variety in more than 40 counties (cities) in Shaanxi Province had reached over 9.95 million mu, accounting for about 40% of the province's total wheat field area. According to the results of experiments in Shaanxi from 1947 to 1950, the average yield of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat per mu was more than 313 jin, exceeding the yield of several locally promoted wheat varieties by 18 jin to 71 jin. Over the past five years, the average yield of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat planted by farmers in Shaanxi Province has generally reached around 300 jin per mu, an increase of 30 jin to 60 jin compared to other local wheat varieties. Some high-yield households have achieved yields as high as 500 jin to 600 jin per mu.
    The advantages of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat are: large grains, thin skin, good quality, white and strong flour, and high flour yield. According to experiments at Northwest Agricultural College, the flour yield of this wheat is as high as 89.83%. "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat has stiff stalks, and is not prone to lodging under normal climatic and cultivation conditions, which is one of the reasons why farmers like to grow it.
    "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat has a wide range of adaptation. According to a three-year experiment from 1951 to 1953 at the Xuzhou Miscellaneous Grain Experimental Farm in Jiangsu Province, the average yield per mu was more than 374 jin, an increase of 23% compared to local wheat in Xuzhou. In 1953, Chen Yongming, a labor model in Xiao County, Jiangsu Province, achieved a yield of 641 jin per mu with "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat. In addition, according to the results of several years of trials and pilot planting in some areas of Shanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, and Gansu provinces, the unit yield of this wheat is higher than that of the original promoted wheat in those areas. In Luoyang, Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Xuchang and other special districts of Henan Province, the average yield reached about 350 jin per mu in this year's expanded pilot planting, an increase of dozens or more than 100 jin per mu compared to local wheat in general. The average yield of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat in Qingyang, Pingliang, Tianshui and other special districts of Gansu Province this year is also above 300 jin per mu.
    "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat is a semi-winter variety with medium cold resistance. In its place of origin, the suitable sowing period is between the Autumn Equinox and the Cold Dew. If it is sown at the same time as local general varieties of wheat, it will grow too vigorously before winter and be easily damaged by frost; but on the other hand, it has resistance to spring frost. The growth period of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat is similar to that of other wheat varieties. For example, in the Guanzhong area, its growth period is about 244 days, and in the Jinan area of Shandong Province, it is about 239 days.
    "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat is not infected with stripe rust, but is slightly susceptible to leaf rust, stem rust, and common bunt. In addition, it is also susceptible to wheat blossom midge, so it is not suitable for planting in areas with severe wheat blossom midge infestations.
    The cultivation methods for "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat should be adapted to its characteristics. For example, it has large grains and weak tillering ability, requiring appropriate dense planting. It has strong fertilizer tolerance and grows particularly well and yields particularly high in fertile irrigated land; the yield increase effect is not significant when planted in barren land. In addition, "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat has a short dormancy period and is prone to germination in rainy weather, so it should be harvested in a timely manner after maturity.
    Currently, winter wheat is about to be sown, and many areas have introduced a large quantity of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat seeds this year. Therefore, all areas that have introduced the seeds should seize the time to formulate promotion plans and distribute the seeds to the masses as soon as possible. In the process of promotion, rural workers must clearly explain the characteristics and cultivation techniques of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat to the masses. During the wheat growing season, technical guidance should be strengthened to overcome the practice of "not caring after a fine variety is promoted." In order to continuously improve the quality of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat, agricultural production cooperatives with suitable conditions can also establish wheat seed retention plots in order to continuously consolidate and strengthen the excellent characteristics of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat.

    推广小麦良种碧蚂一号
    李梅森
    碧蚂一号小麦，是西北农学院赵洪璋教授在一九四七年培育成功的杂交品种。到一九五五年，陕西省四十多个县（市）种植这一良种小麦的面积已达九百九十五万多亩，约占全省麦田总面积的百分之四十。据一九四七至一九五○年陕西试验的结果，碧蚂一号小麦每亩平均产量是三百一十三斤多，高出当地原推广的几种小麦产量十八斤至七十一斤。五年来陕西省农民种植的碧蚂一号小麦，每亩产量一般达到三百斤左右，比当地农家品种的其他小麦增产三十斤至六十斤；有些丰产户的每亩产量高达五百斤至六百斤。
    碧蚂一号小麦的优点是：籽粒大，皮薄，品质好，面色白而有劲，出粉率高。据西北农学院试验，这种小麦的出粉率高达百分之八十九点八三。碧蚂一号小麦茎秆硬，在一般气候和耕作条件下不易倒伏，这也是农民喜欢种它的原因之一。
    碧蚂一号小麦的适应地区较广，据江苏省徐州杂谷试验场一九五一年到一九五三年的三年试验，平均每亩产三百七十四斤多，比徐州当地小麦增产百分之二十三。一九五三年江苏省萧县劳动模范陈永铭种植的碧蚂一号小麦，每亩产量达到六百四十一斤。此外，据山西、山东、安徽、河南、甘肃等省部分地区几年来的试验、试种的结果，这种小麦都比当地原推广的小麦的单位产量要高。河南省洛阳、新乡、开封、许昌等专区，今年扩大试种的结果，每亩平均产量达到三百五十斤左右，比当地小麦一般每亩增产数十斤或一百多斤。甘肃省庆阳、平凉、天水等专区今年的碧蚂一号小麦每亩平均产量也在三百斤以上。
    碧蚂一号小麦是半冬性品种，抗寒力中等，在它的原产地，适宜的播种期是秋分到寒露之间。如果和当地一般品种的小麦同时播种，它就会在冬前生长过旺，容易受冻；但另一方面它又具有对春霜的抵抗力。碧蚂一号小麦的生长期同其他小麦差不多，例如，在关中地区，它的生长期约为二百四十四天，在山东省济南一带约为二百三十九天。
    碧蚂一号小麦不感染条锈病，但对叶锈病、秆锈病和秆黑粉病有轻微感染。另外它还容易遭受吸浆虫为害，所以，在吸浆虫害严重的地区，不宜种植。
    碧蚂一号小麦的栽培方法应该适应它的特点。例如，它籽粒大，分蘖力较弱，需要适当密植。它耐肥力较强，在肥沃的水浇地里生长得特别好，产量也特别高；在瘠薄地种植，增产效果不大。另外，碧蚂一号小麦的休眠期较短，遇到雨天容易发芽，所以成熟后应及时收割。
    目前，冬小麦即将播种，而各地今年引种碧蚂一号麦种的数量很多，因此，凡引种的地区，应该抓紧时间做好推广计划，及早地把种子发到群众手里。在推广过程中，农村工作人员必须把碧蚂一号小麦的特性和栽培技术向群众解释清楚，在小麦生长期间，应加强技术指导，克服那种“良种推出去后就不管不问”的做法。为了不断提高碧蚂一号小麦的质量，有条件的农业生产合作社，还可以建立小麦留种地，以便不断巩固和加强碧蚂一号小麦的优良特性。
