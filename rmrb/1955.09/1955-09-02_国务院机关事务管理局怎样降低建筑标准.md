    The offices, dormitories, auditoriums, dining halls, nurseries, guesthouses, garages, etc., used by the central state organs and various parties and groups, originally planned for a total construction area of 156,600 square meters this year, were to be uniformly constructed by the State Council机关事务管理局. Among them, the construction cost per square meter for five- to six-story buildings along the main roads was 120 yuan; the construction cost per square meter for nine- to ten-story buildings along Beijing's main axes was 150 yuan. All dormitories were to cost 100 yuan per square meter. The construction cost per square meter for auxiliary buildings ranged from 90 yuan to 110 yuan. In short, the original planned costs were very high.
    In accordance with the spirit of rigorous economy, the State Council机关事务管理局 re-examined the original construction plan. First, it was found that many projects in the original plan could be reduced.
    In terms of office space, after investigating the current actual use of office space by various central organs, and taking into account the situation after the streamlining of organizations and personnel, the existing houses were rationally reallocated, reducing the originally planned construction area by 25,673 square meters, while still basically meeting current needs.
    In terms of auxiliary buildings, the original plan was to build a small auditorium with a capacity of 700 people and a construction area of 1,050 square meters. After careful study, the scope of use was narrowed (the original plan was for multiple uses such as meetings, performances, film screenings, and banquets), and auxiliary buildings such as the lobby, backstage, and lounge were removed. The construction area was changed to 531 square meters, which could still meet the needs of 700 people for meetings. In addition, the number of nurseries, garages, boiler rooms, and other auxiliary buildings was reduced, resulting in a further reduction of 4,581 square meters.
    In terms of family dormitories, the living unit area designed in the past was too large, and the utilization efficiency was relatively low. For example, in the family dormitories uniformly built in Hepingli, a suburb of the city, last year, the construction area per floor of each building unit was 150 square meters, of which the living area accounted for only 49.2 percent, the auxiliary area accounted for 17.5 percent, the traffic area accounted for 14.3 percent, and the structural area reached 19 percent. Because the proportion of non-living area was relatively large, each floor could only accommodate two families, each with two living rooms, one kitchen, and one toilet, plus a small room of more than six square meters that could accommodate one person, occupying a total construction area of 75 square meters. Although the standard drawing used for the family dormitories currently being built outside Fuchengmen has been improved, the non-living area still accounts for 45 percent. On the one hand, the cost is high, and on the other hand, the non-living area is large. As a result, the state needs to invest more than 7,400 yuan to solve the housing problem for a family of staff members. This not only increases the state's construction costs, but also increases the monthly rent burden of the staff.
    The State Council机关事务管理局 and the Beijing Design Institute carefully studied this situation. In the redesigned 23,000 square meters of family dormitory project, the previous unit plan layout was changed. The construction area per floor of each building unit was increased to 272.5 square meters. Among them, the living area accounted for 58 percent, the auxiliary area accounted for 15 percent, the traffic area accounted for 13.4 percent, and the structural area accounted for only 13.6 percent. Each floor can accommodate six families, each still with two living rooms and a small kitchen, and each unit has a common toilet, occupying a construction area of no more than 45 square meters. In this way, from the perspective of use effect, there is not much defect, but the cost is reduced a lot. The construction cost per square meter of this new design does not exceed 58 yuan. That is to say, it used to be necessary for the state to invest more than 7,400 yuan to solve the housing problem for a family of staff members, but now only 2,610 yuan is enough, reducing the state's investment by more than 65 percent. Moreover, after reducing the total planned construction area of dormitories by 21,307 square meters, the number of households not only did not decrease, but increased from the originally planned 850 households to 900 households, making the utilization efficiency of the construction area also increased by nearly 66 percent.
    From the perspective of the burden on housing personnel, the new design has lower construction standards. Compared with the old design of dormitories, the rent burden per household will be reduced by 45 to 48 percent.
    In terms of the cost of various projects, after inspection and accounting, it can also be greatly reduced. According to the spirit indicated in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on rigorous economy, the following different measures were taken separately according to the different progress of each project.
    For projects that have already started construction or are preparing to start construction, the standards of indoor and outdoor decoration and equipment were vigorously reduced, and some designs were modified, taking into account the requirements of applicability and avoiding temporary savings that would lead to long-term inapplicability or long-term waste. For example, the originally designed wooden floors and terrazzo floor wall skirts were all changed to cement plaster; all No. 90 plain concrete bedding layers were changed to broken brick and lime soil; double-sided plywood doors were changed to panel doors; and wooden window sills and curtain boxes were eliminated. In terms of decoration, the plastering method of the interior walls was changed, and the washed stone was removed from the exterior walls and replaced with cement plaster. On the roof construction, most of the flat roofs were changed to two-slope roofs. In terms of structure, some concrete lintels were changed to brick lintels, and the mortar grade of some brick walls was reduced. In terms of heating equipment, some bathtubs were eliminated, the heating coefficient was reduced, and the decoration of some pipes and heating elements was reduced. Through the above measures, taking a five-story family dormitory building (the part with a basement is six stories) with a designed budget as an example, the cost per square meter can be reduced to within 77 yuan, which is 23 percent lower than the original planned cost. It is initially estimated that more than 1.6 million yuan can be saved.
    For projects that started construction after July, new economic indicators were re-stipulated according to the new cost standards. The cost per square meter of office buildings is 70 yuan, and the cost per square meter of dormitories is 60 yuan. This part of the project is currently being designed.
    In addition, it is also planned to build some simple dormitories at a cost of 40 yuan per square meter. After preliminary research with the design unit, these indicators can still be guaranteed to be achieved.
    After this accounting, the total construction area of houses uniformly constructed by the State Council机关事务管理局 was reduced by 51,561 square meters, accounting for about 33 percent of the original plan; a total of more than 14.5 million yuan was saved, a reduction of more than 60 percent compared to the original plan.
    The reason why the State Council机关事务管理局 was able to achieve these results in reducing non-productive construction standards is first of all due to the direct guidance of the leading comrades of the State Council, who attached great importance to and resolutely and conscientiously implemented the spirit of the central government's comprehensive economy instructions. In the process of implementation, full cooperation was obtained from relevant parties, especially the Beijing Design Institute. After study, the design personnel also overcame the formalistic design ideas and individualistic masterpiece ideas that were divorced from the current economic conditions and living standards in the past, and conscientiously implemented the requirements of achieving both economic indicators and ensuring applicability. The second is to give full play to the collective wisdom of the masses. In order to achieve the maximum degree of economy, the State Council机关事务管理局 conducted many joint or separate discussions and consultations with relevant staff members in design, construction, and other aspects. Each time was deeper than the last, and each time certain results were obtained. Taking a five-story family dormitory building as an example: After the first study, the cost per square meter was reduced from the original design budget of 95 yuan 2 jiao 8 fen to about 85 yuan; after the second study, it was reduced to about 78 yuan; and finally reduced to within 77 yuan.
    From the above facts, it shows that the central government's instructions on reducing non-productive construction standards are not only correct and timely, but also completely achievable. As long as the leading staff of each unit attach importance to it ideologically, and widely mobilize the employees to work together actively, they will surely be able to think of more ways to save money.

    国务院机关事务管理局怎样降低建筑标准
    卜一明
    中央国家机关和各党派各团体使用的办公室、宿舍、礼堂、饭厅、托儿所、招待所、汽车库等，今年原计划有十五万六千六百平方公尺的建筑面积由国务院机关事务管理局负责统一筹建。其中沿马路线建的五层到六层的建筑，每平方公尺造价是一百二十元；沿北京市主要轴线建的九层到十层的建筑，每平方公尺造价是一百五十元。全部宿舍每平方公尺造价都是一百元。附属用房每平方公尺造价从九十元到一百一十元。总之，原计划的造价是很高的。
    根据厉行节约的精神，国务院机关事务管理局重新审核了原订的建筑计划。首先发现原计划中的很多项目都可以核减。
    在办公用房方面，通过对于中央各机关目前实际用房情况的调查，并结合整编机构精简人员后的情况，把现有房屋合理调配一下以后，在原计划建筑面积内减少了二万五千六百七十三平方公尺，仍可基本上满足当前的需要。
    在附属用房方面，原计划建筑一座可容七百人、建筑面积一千零五十平方公尺的小礼堂，经过仔细研究，缩小了使用范围（原计划可以开会、演戏、放电影、宴会等多方面使用），减去了门厅、后台、休息室等辅助建筑，将建筑面积改为五百三十一平方公尺，仍可满足七百人开会的使用要求。另外减少了托儿所和汽车库、锅炉房等其他用房，又减少四千五百八十一平方公尺。
    在眷属宿舍方面，过去设计的居住单位面积过大，使用效率就相对地降低了。例如去年在市郊和平里统一建筑的眷属宿舍，每一建筑单元的每层建筑面积是一百五十平方公尺，其中居住面积仅占百分之四十九点二，辅助面积占百分之十七点五，交通面积占百分之十四点三，结构面积达百分之十九。由于非居住面积所占的比例较大，结果每层只能分住两家，每家有住室两间，厨房、厕所各一间，另有六平方公尺多可住一个人的小房一间，共占用建筑面积七十五平方公尺。目前正在阜成门外建筑的眷属宿舍所采用的标准图，虽然已有改进，但是非居住面积仍占百分之四十五。一方面造价高，一方面非居住面积大，结果国家为解决工作人员一家的住房问题，就需要投资七千四百多元。这不仅增加国家建设费用的支出，同时也加重了工作人员每月的房租负担。
    国务院机关事务管理局和北京市设计院仔细研究了这一情况，在重新设计的二万三千平方公尺眷属宿舍工程中，改变了过去那种单元平面布置，每一建筑单元的每层建筑面积增为二百七十二点五平方公尺。其中居住面积占百分之五十八，辅助面积占百分之十五，交通面积占百分之十三点四，结构面积仅占百分之十三点六。每层可以分住六家，每家仍然有两间住室一小间厨房，每一单元有一个公用厕所，占用的建筑面积不过四十五平方公尺。这样，从使用效果上来看，并没有多大的缺陷，而造价却降低了很多。这种新的设计每平方公尺造价不超过五十八元。就是说，从前需要由国家拿出七千四百多元的投资来解决工作人员一家的住房问题，现在仅用二千六百一十元就够了，减少了国家投资百分之六十五以上。而且将原计划建筑宿舍的总面积减少了二万一千三百零七平方公尺后，居住户数不但没有减少，反而从原计划的八百五十户增加到能居住九百户，使建筑面积的使用效率也提高了将近百分之六十六。
    从住房人员的负担来看，新设计图由于建筑标准较低，同旧设计的宿舍比较，每户的租金负担将减少百分之四十五至四十八。
    在各项工程的造价方面，经过检查核算，也可以大大降低。根据李富春副总理关于厉行节约的报告所指示的精神，按照各项工程不同的进度情况，分别采取了以下不同的措施。
    对于已经开始施工或正在筹备开工的工程，在照顾到适用要求、避免一时节约而造成长期不适用或长期浪费的原则下，大力降低了室内外的装修和设备标准，修改了部分设计。如原设计的木地板和水磨石地面墙裙一律改为水泥抹面；所有的九十号素混凝土垫层都改为碎砖三合土；双面三夹板门改为门心板门；取消了木窗台板和窗帘盒。在粉饰方面，内墙改变了抹灰作法，外墙取消了水刷石，改为水泥抹面。在屋顶建筑上，将大部分平屋顶改成了两坡屋顶。在结构方面，将部分混凝土过梁改成了砖过梁，降低了部分砖墙的砂浆标号。在暖气设备方面，取消部分浴盆，降低了采暖系数，并减少了一部分管路和暖片的粉饰。通过以上各项措施，以已经作出设计预算的一幢五层眷属宿舍楼（有地下室的部分为六层）来计算，每平方公尺的造价已可降低到七十七元以内，较原计划造价降低了百分之二十三，初步估算可以节约一百六十多万元。
    对于在七月份以后开始施工的工程，按照新的造价标准，重新规定了经济指标。办公楼每平方公尺造价是七十元，宿舍每平方公尺造价是六十元。这部分工程目前正在设计。
    另外，还计划以每平方公尺四十元的造价建筑一些简易的宿舍，同设计单位初步研究后，这些指标还能够保证达到。
    经过这次核算，国务院机关事务管理局统一筹建的房屋建筑面积共减少了五万一千五百六十一平方公尺，约为原计划的百分之三十三；共节约造价一千四百五十多万元，较原计划减少百分之六十以上。
    国务院机关事务管理局在降低非生产性建筑标准方面所以能够获得这些结果，首先是由于国务院领导同志的直接指导，重视并坚决认真地贯彻了中央全面节约的指示精神。在执行过程中，充分获得了有关各方面，首先是北京市设计院的协作。设计人员经过学习，也克服了过去那种脱离目前经济条件和生活水平的形式主义的设计思想和个人主义的杰作思想，认真地贯彻了既要达到经济指标又能保证适用的要求。再次是充分发挥了群众的集体智慧。为了达到最大限度的节约，国务院机关事务管理局曾经同设计、施工等方面的有关工作人员共同地或分别地进行了多次座谈和协商，一次比一次深入，每次都能获得一定的成果。以一幢五层眷属宿舍楼为例：经过第一次研究，每平方公尺造价由原设计预算九十五元二角八分，降低到八十五元左右；经过第二次研究，就降到了七十八元左右；最后降低到七十七元以内。
    从以上各项事实，说明中央对于降低非生产建筑标准的指示不仅是正确的、适时的，也是完全可能达到的。各单位领导工作人员只要思想上重视，并广泛地发动职工共同积极努力，一定还能想到更多的节约办法。
