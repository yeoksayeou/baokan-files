Farmers in the Hotan region and Bachu and Awat counties in Xinjiang Province are actively collecting wild hemp to sell to the state.

According to investigations, the output of wild hemp in the Hotan region is very large. In Daheyan in Yutian County, Damagou in Cele County, and Yulong Kash in Luopu County, the area covered by wild hemp is several hundred to two or three thousand square li. The area covered by wild hemp in Awat County is about 22,500 mu, with an annual output of over 200 tons.

In the past, people did not pay much attention to this huge wealth, and it was abandoned for a long time as weeds and bushes on the Gobi Desert. This year, all wild hemp producing areas have vigorously carried out publicity work among the masses. When the Cele County Trading Store purchased wild hemp, it used samples ranging from the raw hemp to finished products to publicize to the masses, explaining that wild hemp can be made into high-quality and beautiful clothing materials. After this, the masses actively collected wild hemp to sell to the state. According to incomplete statistics, the Hotan region and Bachu and Awat counties have purchased more than 200,000 jin of wild hemp.

    南疆农民采集野麻卖给国家
    新疆省和阗专区和巴楚、阿瓦提两县农民，积极采集野麻卖给国家。
    据调查，和阗专区野麻产量很大，于阗县大河沿、策勒县大马沟、洛浦县玉龙喀什等地，野麻面积都有几百以至两三千平方里。阿瓦提县野麻面积约有两万二千五百多亩，年产野麻可达二百吨以上。
    过去人们对这一巨大财富并不重视，长期抛弃在戈壁滩的杂草和林丛中。今年各产野麻区大力向群众进行了宣传工作。策勒县贸易商店收购野麻时，拿着从原麻到制成成品的样品，向群众宣传，说明野麻可以制造成高级美好衣料。此后，群众积极采集野麻卖给国家。现据不完全统计，和阗专区和巴楚、阿瓦提两县共已收购野麻二十多万斤。
