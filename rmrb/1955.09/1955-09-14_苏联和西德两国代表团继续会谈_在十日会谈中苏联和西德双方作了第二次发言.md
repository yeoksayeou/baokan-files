Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th: TASS reported from Moscow on September 12th: On September 12th, Moscow time 16:00, the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany held their third meeting.

At the meeting, reports were heard from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Brentano of the Federal Republic of Germany on the results of the foreign ministers' talks, which were held according to the resolution adopted at the second meeting of the two government delegations.

Opinions were exchanged on the reports of the foreign ministers. Those who expressed opinions included N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and head of the Soviet government delegation, Konrad Adenauer, Federal Chancellor and head of the government delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany, Schmidt, Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federal Parliament, and Khrushchev, member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

It has now been decided to continue the exchange of views at the next meeting, which is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on September 13th.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 12th: TASS reported from Moscow on September 12th: At the second meeting of the Soviet and Federal Republic of Germany government delegations' negotiations held on the 10th, both sides made their second speeches.

In his second speech, Federal Chancellor Adenauer of the Federal Republic of Germany first said that this morning they had a very serious conversation, and the German delegation would consider the Soviet delegation's speech in great detail and seriously.

Adenauer said that they came here to restore normal and good relations between the peoples of the two countries, not just to establish normal diplomatic relations - this is only a small part of their mission. That is why they believe they should talk about the fate of all those detained and the issue of restoring German unity.

Adenauer denied that he had ever said that Soviet troops had committed crimes after entering Germany. He said, "I consciously did not say such a thing. I said that terrible things had happened during the advance. It is right not to talk much about these things here."

Adenauer then spoke of the growth of Hitlerism as being related to the tolerance of some major powers. He said that the German Federal Government and members of parliament are the unfortunate successors of all these things. "We should strive to revive Germany and strive to regain the trust of foreign countries and your trust."

Adenauer hoped that the Soviet side would agree to continue discussing the issue of detained Germans.

Adenauer said that although he knew that many captured Germans had been convicted of the crimes they had committed, he still hoped that the Soviet side would agree to continue studying and discussing this issue.

Adenauer then spoke of the German Democratic Republic. He agreed that the Germans themselves should take the initiative to hold talks, but he said: "The government of the German Democratic Republic cannot claim to represent the Germans living in the Soviet zone, because the residents of the Soviet zone have not recognized it as their representative."

Adenauer finally stated that he agreed that the Soviet Union and West Germany could develop economic relations that would be very beneficial to both sides. He suggested that wartime and post-war issues be put aside for now and that the discussion should turn to economic relations.

Bulganin expressed his views on what Adenauer said above. Bulganin said, "I cannot describe what Adenauer said about the government of the German Democratic Republic as anything other than an attack. It is enough to refute Adenauer's words by citing the following facts. Khrushchev and I recently visited the German Democratic Republic, visited many cities and towns, and we saw that the German people respected and recognized the government of the German Democratic Republic and regarded it as their own government. Moreover, the government of the German Democratic Republic is an autonomous government recognized by many European countries and two major powers - the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. I believe that the arguments put forward here by the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany cannot promote mutual understanding between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in resolving the issue of the unification of the two parts of the German people. As for your suggestion to turn to the discussion of economic issues now, the Soviet government does not object to this suggestion."

Hallstein, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany, spoke on the issue of economic relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union. In this regard, he argued that it was necessary to conduct specialized negotiations with the Soviet government on the types and quantities of trade exchange.

When exchanging opinions on this issue, Adenauer said: "The delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany does not know the specific economic situation now, so it cannot say: 'Let's sign a trade agreement.'" He agreed that a special delegation should conduct special talks. Bulganin agreed to do so.

Subsequently, Khrushchev spoke. He said: "Today's meeting is very interesting and very extensive. If we are emotional, it will be difficult to solve the problems raised for discussion. But if we can be calm and discuss the issues raised here with the attitude of a politician, and if we do not let our emotions get excited and control our emotions, then it should be admitted that we now have many things that should be seriously considered, because we have had an extremely beneficial exchange of views."

"Of course, we face many difficulties. These difficulties are: we and you stand on different positions in terms of ideology, and our meeting with you is the first time, so we have certain prejudices against each other."

"Therefore, it takes some time for all of us to fully realize that we all live in one world, on one planet. You are a capitalist system, and we are a socialist system. We do not support your system, and you do not support our system. But since these two systems exist, we must seek some common ground sufficient for normal coexistence. We must proceed from the actual situation."

"We have established a socialist economic structure in our country, and you have a capitalist economic structure. We do not need to argue about who is better or worse, capitalism or socialism. The socialist economy exists and is developing very victoriously. The Soviet Union has transformed from a backward semi-feudal country into a powerful industrial country in a short period of time - this is an indisputable fact. From a illiterate Russia, our country has grown into a powerful country with a high level of culture and political awareness among the people during the years of the Soviet regime. And this is the result of the victory of socialism, the victory of the people. The majority of people follow us. You are all very clear that the people of Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, and many other countries in Europe and Asia are moving along this path. Many countries are carrying out internal struggles, and the people of these countries are solving the problem of which path they will develop along in the future. Communism has become a great force."

"The emergence of communism is also 'blame' you Germans. Because Marx and Engels were born in Germany. You are the architects of your own misfortune. (Laughter)"

"Adenauer, you probably know the name Feldmengs? He is a relative of Engels."

"That is the root of the whole problem."

"The situation of the coexistence of socialism and capitalism has been formed. We should take this fact as a starting point, because this is the main thing. Let us reach an agreement on this aspect."

"I understand Mr. Adenauer. You don't want to recognize the German Democratic Republic. We understand this very well. For many years, many people in capitalist countries insisted that Lenin was a utopian. Some people said that the Soviet system established by the great Lenin and the Communist Party he founded would not last long in Russia. In the West, some people said that the Soviet state was a paper tiger. Others said many such stupid things. For how many years has our Soviet Republic not been recognized by any country in Europe!"

Bulganin said: "The United States did not recognize us for sixteen years in a row."

Khrushchev said: "Yes, the United States did not recognize the Soviet Union for sixteen years. But we did not cease to exist because of this."

"The People's Republic of China is constantly growing stronger and more consolidated. Some capitalist countries have not recognized it, but the People's Republic of China will not cease to exist because of this. New things are always born in pain and are not recognized by the old for a long time. The German Democratic Republic is now in this situation."

"Why should we oppose the German Democratic Republic? Is it because its people have taken power into their own hands? Is it because the national economy of the German Democratic Republic is built on the basis of the interests of the German people? Isn't that good? If the government of the German Democratic Republic defends and protects the interests of the working class, peasants, and working intellectuals of its own country, then how can it be said that it does not represent the opinions of the German people? You put private enterprises first. Why should workers welcome and support you, instead of welcoming and supporting a government that stands on the position of the working class and defends this position?"

"We are clear about your attitude towards the German Democratic Republic, but we cannot agree with this attitude. Your point of view is not absolutely correct. We understand the views of some people who account for only a minority among the entire people of the country."

"I am not asking you to agree with what I said. I know for sure that you will not agree with what I said. But the German Democratic Republic is the future. This is not only the future of the German people. Marx and Engels once predicted this future. We support the German working people in building their German Democratic Republic on the basis of socialism. They are achieving very good results in this regard."

During the subsequent debate between the two sides, Adenauer said: "Differences in ideological issues do not prevent the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany from cooperating with each other."

    苏联和西德两国代表团继续会谈
    在十日会谈中苏联和西德双方作了第二次发言
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：九月十二日莫斯科时间十六时，苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团举行第三次会议。
    会上听取了苏联外交部长莫洛托夫和德意志联邦共和国外交部长勃伦塔诺关于外长会谈结果的报告，这次会谈是根据两国政府代表团第二次会议上所通过的决议而举行的。
    就外长们的报告交换了意见，发表意见的有苏联政府代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，德意志联邦共和国政府代表团团长、联邦总理阿登纳，联邦议院外交委员会副主席施密特和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫。
    现已决定在下次会议上继续交换意见，下次会议定在九月十三日上午十时举行。
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：在十日举行的苏联同德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团谈判的第二次会议上，双方都作了第二次发言。
    德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳在第二次发言时首先说，今天上午我们作了十分认真的会谈，德国代表团将十分详尽和认真地考虑苏联代表团的发言。
    阿登纳说，我们来到了这里，是为了恢复我们两国人民之间正常的、良好的关系，而不是仅仅为了来建立正常的外交关系——这只是我们任务的一小部分。这就是为什么我们认为应当谈谈所有被拘禁的人的命运以及恢复德国统一问题的原因。
    阿登纳否认他曾经说过苏联军队在进入德国之后也曾犯有罪行。他说，我有意识地不说这样的话。我说的是：在进军时也曾经发生了可怕的事情。在这里不多谈这些事情是正确的。
    阿登纳接着谈到希特勒主义的成长同一些大国的纵容有关。他说，德意志联邦政府和国会议员，是这一切事情的不幸的继承者。我们应该努力复兴德国和争取重新获得外国的信任和你们的信任。
    阿登纳希望苏联方面答应继续一同讨论关于被拘禁的德国人的问题。
    阿登纳说，他虽然知道许多被俘掳的德国人由于他们所犯的罪行而被判罪，但是，他仍然希望苏联方面同意继续研究和讨论这个问题。
    阿登纳接着谈到德意志民主共和国。他表示同意德国人自己应当采取主动来举行会谈，但是他说：德意志民主共和国政府不能自命为生活在苏区的德国人的代表，因为苏区居民并没有承认它是他们的代表。
    阿登纳最后表示，他同意苏联同西德可以发展对双方都十分有利的经济关系。他建议现在搁置战时和战后的问题而转入关于经济关系的讨论。
    布尔加宁针对阿登纳上面所说的话发表了意见。布尔加宁说，阿登纳所说的关于德意志民主共和国政府的那些话，除了称之为攻击以外，我无法把它说成是别的。只要举出下列一些事实就足以反驳阿登纳的话。我同赫鲁晓夫不久以前曾经到过德意志民主共和国，访问过许多城市和村镇，我们看到德国人民尊重和承认德意志民主共和国政府，并且把这个政府看作自己的政府。而且，德意志民主共和国政府是得到许多欧洲国家和两个大国——苏联和中华人民共和国——承认的自主的政府。我以为，德意志联邦共和国代表团在这里所提出的论据不能促使德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国在解决德国两部分人民统一的问题上互相谅解。至于你所提的现在就转而讨论经济问题的建议，苏联政府对这个建议并不表示反对。
    德意志联邦共和国外交部副部长哈尔斯坦就德意志联邦共和国和苏联之间的经济关系问题发言。他在这方面主张必须同苏联政府就贸易交换的种类和数量的问题进行专门的谈判。
    在就这个问题交换意见时，阿登纳说：现在德意志联邦共和国代表团不知道经济方面的具体情况，因此不能够说：“我们就来签订一项贸易协定”。他同意由专门的代表团进行专门的会谈。布尔加宁同意这样做。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫发言。他说：今天我们的会议非常有趣，内容非常广泛。如果我们感情用事，提出讨论的问题就很难解决了。但是，如果我们能够冷静，用政治家的态度来讨论这里所提出的问题，如果我们不让感情激动，而控制住感情，那就应当承认，我们现在有许多应当认真思考的事，因为我们曾经举行了极其有益处的交换意见。
    当然，我们面前有不少的困难。这些困难就是：我们和你们在意识形态方面站在不同的立场上，而我们和你们的会晤又是第一次，因此，我们相互之间有一定的成见。
    所以，需要一些时间，以使我们大家充分地认识到我们大家是生活在一个世界上，生活在一个行星上。你们是资本主义制度，我们是社会主义制度。我们不拥护你们的制度，你们也不拥护我们的制度。但是，既然这两种制度存在着，那就必须寻求某种足以正常共处的共同接触点。必须以实际情况为出发点。
    我们在自己国家中建立了社会主义的经济结构，而你们的是资本主义经济结构。我们用不着争论资本主义和社会主义谁好谁坏。社会主义经济存在着，而且非常胜利地发展着。苏联在短期间内从一个落后的半封建国家变成一个强大的工业国家——这是无可争辩的事实。从文盲的俄国，我们国家在苏维埃政权年代中成长为人民具有高度文化水平和政治觉悟的强大的国家。而这就是社会主义胜利的结果，人民胜利的结果。大多数人跟随着我们。你们都很清楚地知道，波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、中华人民共和国以及欧洲和亚洲其他许多国家的人民都沿着这条道路前进。许多国家进行着内部的斗争，这些国家的人民正在解决他们今后沿着什么道路发展的问题。共产主义成了伟大的力量。
    共产主义的产生，也要“怪”你们德国人。因为马克思和恩格斯生在德国。你们是自作自受。（笑声）
    阿登纳，你大概晓得费尔德门格斯这个名字吧？他是恩格斯的亲戚。
    这就是整个问题的根源。
    社会主义和资本主义两种制度并存的形势已经形成了。我们应当以这种事实作为出发点，因为这是主要的东西。让我们就这方面来取得协议吧。
    我了解阿登纳先生。你不想承认德意志民主共和国。我们很明白这一点。多少年来，资本主义国家中许多人硬说列宁这个人是个空想家。有人说，伟大的列宁和他所缔造的共产党所建立的苏维埃制度在俄国长不了。在西方有人说，苏维埃国家是一个纸糊的大国。还有人讲了许多诸如此类的蠢话。我们苏维埃共和国曾经在多少年里没有获得欧洲任何一个国家的承认啊！
    布尔加宁说：美国一连十六年没有承认我们。
    赫鲁晓夫说：是的，美国在十六年中没有承认苏联。但是，我们并没有因此而不存在。
    中华人民共和国不断壮大和日益巩固。某些资本主义国家也没有承认它，但是，中华人民共和国并不会因此而不存在。新的东西总是在痛苦中诞生的，并且长时期不为陈旧的所承认。德意志民主共和国现在也正处在这种情况下。
    为什么我们要反对德意志民主共和国呢？是不是因为它的人民把政权掌握在自己手里，是不是因为德意志民主共和国的国民经济是建筑在德国人民利益的基础上呢？难道这不好吗？如果德意志民主共和国政府捍卫和保护着自己国家的工人阶级、农民和劳动知识分子的利益，那又怎样能说它不代表德国人民的意见呢？你们把私人企业摆在第一位。工人为什么要欢迎和支持你们，而不是欢迎和支持站在工人阶级的立场和捍卫这种立场的政府呢？
    你对德意志民主共和国的态度我们是清楚的，但是我们并不能同意这种态度。你的观点并不是绝对正确的。我们了解某些在国家全体人民当中只占少数的人士的观点。
    我并不要求你同意我的说法。我肯定地知道，你不会同意我的说法的。但是德意志民主共和国就是未来。这不仅是德国人民的未来。马克思和恩格斯曾经预言过这种未来。我们支持德国劳动人民把自己的德意志民主共和国建筑在社会主义的基础上。他们在这方面获得很好的结果。
    在随后双方辩论的过程中，阿登纳说：在意识形态问题上的分歧并不妨碍苏联和德意志联邦共和国彼此合作。
