They Resolutely Chose the Path of Cooperation
—The Agricultural Production Cooperative Established by Three Poor Peasant Households and One Lower-Middle Peasant Household in Dongwangzhuang, Xinle County
Shi Shufang

There is an agricultural production cooperative in Dongwangzhuang, Xinle County, Hebei Province, which is a small cooperative with only three poor peasant households and one lower-middle peasant household. Although this cooperative is small and has many difficulties, the members are closely united and have finally overcome the difficulties in running the cooperative, steadily advancing towards the road of agricultural cooperativization.

It Won't Work Without Mutual Benefit
In September of last year, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Dongwangzhuang, Xinle County, was vigorously developing. The two mutual aid groups (totaling twelve households) led by middle peasants Lei Huande and Lei Xidao merged to form an agricultural production cooperative. Lei Huande became the director of the cooperative, and Lei Xidao became the deputy director.

After Lei Huande became the director, he did not handle the internal affairs of the cooperative in accordance with the policy of voluntary mutual benefit. Last year, when planting wheat, it was planted carelessly without stipulating a method. At that time, cooperative member Li Laosuo suggested: "The cooperative should study the method of recording work points. It's careless now, and it will be a mess in the future." Lei Huande did not accept this suggestion, saying, "Everyone is good, and there are no outsiders when it comes to taking losses or gains. What's the point of recording work points?" Originally, Lei Huande had about 30 mu of land, and he was the only main labor force. His two sons could not do heavy work. He felt that recording work points would prevent him from taking advantage, so he disagreed with recording work points. When planting wheat, he participated in planting wheat alone, but told his two sons to raise pigs at home. Deputy Director Lei Xidao followed the director and also told his son to raise pigs at home. At this time, the cooperative members were dissatisfied. Poor peasant cooperative member Li Wumao said, "We all work together without recording work points, which is already a loss for us. They also tell their sons to raise pigs at home. We really can't stand this." When Director Lei Huande heard this, he said to Li Wumao angrily, "If you want to do it, do it; if you don't want to do it, then quit."

Last autumn, the cooperative, led by Director Lei Huande, organized a woodworking factory. It is reasonable that all cooperative members should participate in the cooperative's sideline business. However, Lei Huande and others stipulated a restriction: those who could not provide "seed money" could not participate. At that time, it was stipulated that each household should provide eight yuan. Several poor peasant households, such as Lei Laixi and Lei Dong'er, were refused access to the woodworking factory because they could not afford the "seed money." The mules bought by the cooperative with loans from the state bank worked for the woodworking factory all winter; the poor peasants who were refused access to the woodworking factory had to pay the same amount of interest on the loans. At the same time, poor peasant cooperative members could not participate in sideline production and had to shoulder the extremely heavy farm work in the cooperative. For example, Lei Dong'er built eight pig pens in a row. But these work points were all wasted.

Ending Up with a "Clean Break"
When spring came, the cooperative stipulated a work point recording system. Director Lei Huande felt that it would be difficult to take advantage if work points were recorded, so he colluded with the middle peasant households to prepare to withdraw from the cooperative. During the spring plowing and sowing season, the middle peasants had livestock and carts, and tried their best to plant their own land, leaving the poor peasants' land behind. Lei Laixi's four mu of land was left with a very long cart track (because it was planted late and was crushed into a cart track).

The work of consolidating and reorganizing agricultural production cooperatives began. Lei Huande and other middle peasant cooperative members resolutely wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. However, Lei Huande also felt that if only he and some middle peasant cooperative members withdrew, wouldn't that make him look backward if there were still people continuing to run the cooperative? So he went to mobilize others to withdraw from the cooperative as well. He once called together poor peasant backbone Li Wumao and Party member Li Laosuo and said, "If we don't disband, I'm going to Shanxi." Li Laosuo said, "If you leave, we will still run it." Lei Huande and Lei Xuanshan mobilized Li Wumao to withdraw from the cooperative no less than three or four times, but Li Wumao resolutely refused to withdraw.

During this period, the county and district work teams, the township staff, and the poor peasant backbone of the cooperative consistently implemented the policy of uniting and educating the middle peasants. The township Party branch spent twelve days educating them about the socialist future, explaining the policy of voluntary mutual benefit. The problems they raised were all solved one by one. But in the end, they still resolutely withdrew from the cooperative. When these middle peasant cooperative members withdrew from the cooperative, the poor peasant cooperative members expressed that they would definitely run the cooperative well. Cooperative member Li Wumao said, "The Communist Party led us to turn over, who else should we follow on the socialist road if we don't? Besides, I have suffered enough from the pain of lacking livestock and carts when I was working alone in the past, and I don't want to go back to that miserable road." Lower-middle peasant Lei Shundao also said, "Our lives have improved since the land reform, but there are still difficulties in production. If we want to get rid of difficulties, we can't do it without running a cooperative. I want to follow the cooperative." Party member Li Laosuo declared like an oath: I am a Communist Party member, and I am not afraid of any difficulties. As long as everyone works hard, we will definitely be able to run this small cooperative well. He was elected by everyone to be the director of the cooperative.

No "Flaming Mountain" That Cannot Be Crossed
At this time, the people of Dongwangzhuang were talking about this newly born small cooperative, and everyone's common view was: "Lacking livestock, lacking carts, and having an empty family fortune, it will definitely not last long."

Indeed, this small cooperative faced many difficulties. It was during this most difficult time that the Party branch studied the problems of this small cooperative and determined that branch members Li Zhong'er and Lei Yinxue would provide specific leadership for them. Li Zhong'er spent two days helping them make a full-year production plan. The spring plowing production of this small cooperative began. At that time, the cooperative only had Lei Shundao's small mule, which was so thin that it could not get up when it fell down. There was a set of cart undercarriage that had not been installed. Director Li Laosuo discussed with the Party branch, and branch secretary Lei Jiuwei said, "Don't worry, install my cart undercarriage, we don't need it in our cooperative." Poor peasant Lei Xinxi (who lived in the same courtyard as Li Wumao) heard about it and said generously, "Don't install it, just use our cart." The problem of the cart was solved. Let's look at the task of sowing: the middle peasants who had withdrawn from the cooperative had already arranged a "clever plan," and their own spring white land had already been sown. This small cooperative still had seventeen mu of the thirty-two mu of land unsown. The cooperative members were determined to overcome this difficulty. When plowing the land, the small mule could not pull the plow, so one person used force to push it, and the other person helped the mule pull. Once, Director Li Laosuo harnessed the small mule and drove it to plow the sweet potato field. The ground was dry and the soil was hard, and the people and livestock were using all their strength to plow. When they came back at noon, the people were too tired to eat, and the livestock were too tired to eat grass. They fell down and got up like this, and planted the seventeen mu of spring white land piece by piece. During this lean season, people lacked food and livestock had no grass to feed on. Director Li Laosuo moved around and borrowed, but still couldn't find a solution, so he went to the Party branch again. In addition to selling them four hundred jin of dry grass on credit, Party branch member Li Zhong'er also lent them twenty yuan and encouraged them, saying, "You have just organized, and your family fortune is empty, and difficulties are inevitable. As long as everyone works together, the difficulties can definitely be overcome."

In June, the scorching sun ruthlessly shone on the "glaring sand" land of Dongwangzhuang, and the crops were so dry that they were twisted into ropes. In order to overcome the drought, the cooperative members worked day and night to water the land as if they were on the front line. The small mule could not pull the waterwheel, so people helped it pull. When the mule was too tired to lie down, they simply replaced it with people to pull it. The land was thin and the sand was dry, and they watered it for two or three months.

After the wheat harvest, weeding, watering, planting sweet potatoes and other farm work piled up into knots. At this time, Li Wumao, the main labor force of the cooperative, fell ill. Li Laosuo was the secretary of the township people's committee and was busy with the wheat purchase work. Lei Shundao also had to rush to weed. Five or six mu of sweet potatoes were about to be left unplanted. They had to mobilize all four women in the cooperative to go to the field with seven children to plant sweet potatoes. The women in this village had not yet developed the habit of participating in field production and did not know how to plant. Wumao had to go to the field with them while ill. He taught the women how to cut vines and insert seedlings, and also had to take care of the seven children. In this way, five or six mu of wheat stubble sweet potatoes were planted on time. After planting the sweet potatoes, they owed five yuan for the sweet potato seedlings. People wanted it urgently, and they really couldn't come up with the cash, so they sent Lei Shundao to Party branch member Li Zhong'er to find a solution. Li Zhong'er borrowed five yuan from his cooperative to pay off the debt.

They Still Won
The facts did not develop according to the ideas of some people in Dongwangzhuang; instead, they moved forward according to the path indicated by the Party and the hopes of the cooperative members. They won.

Some individual farmers in Dongwangzhuang lacked manpower and animal power. In the event of a drought, many crops were damaged by the drought. Thanks to the diligence and dedication of all the cooperative members, who overcame all difficulties and persisted in round-the-clock watering, not a single crop was damaged by the drought. The corn was watered five or six times, ensuring a yield of two hundred forty to fifty jin per mu. The thirteen mu of sweet potatoes they planted can yield two thousand jin per mu in good years. This autumn, there will be a total of 20,000 jin of good harvests. The three mu of peanuts and other crops are also growing well. They also planted one mu of eggplants, which have already sold for more than sixty yuan and are expected to sell for more than eighty yuan. These funds, in addition to covering the cooperative's annual expenses, can also repay part of the loan. Last year, when they were four households in the mutual aid group, they only harvested 8,854 jin of raw grain; this year, based on the correctly estimated amount of harvested grain and unharvested crops, they will harvest more than 13,300 jin of raw grain, which is more than 4,000 jin of raw grain more than last year. Last year, poor peasant cooperative member Li Wumao only harvested more than 1,600 jin of raw grain, and this year he will harvest about 3,000 jin. Last year, middle peasant cooperative member Lei Shundao did not have enough grain to eat, but this year he is expected to harvest more than 8,000 jin of sweet potatoes alone, and he will live a prosperous life. However, farmer Lei Gouba, who withdrew from the cooperative, harvested more than 1,300 jin of raw grain less than last year due to drought, weak labor, and illness in his family. He regretted saying, "If I hadn't withdrawn from the cooperative, I wouldn't have harvested so much less grain." If you ask Li Wumao how the cooperative's harvest is this year, he will tell you with a smile, "If we hadn't resolutely run the cooperative, we wouldn't have thought of this year's good harvest." Lei Xinxi's aunt said enviously, "At that time, everyone said that this small and poor cooperative would not last long, but now they have managed to bring the 'dead cooperative' back to life."

    他们坚决选择了合作化的道路
    ——新乐县东王庄三户贫农一户下中农办成农业生产合作社
    史树芳
    河北省新乐县东王庄有一个农业生产合作社，是一个只有三户贫农、一户下中农的小社。这社虽小，困难虽多，但社员们紧紧地团结在一起，终于克服了办社中的困难，稳步地向着农业合作化的大道前进。
    不互利是行不通的
    去年九月里，新乐县东王庄的互助合作运动蓬勃地开展。中农雷焕德和雷喜道领导的两个互助组（共十二户）合并成为一个农业生产合作社。雷焕德当了社长，雷喜道当了副社长。
    雷焕德当了社长以后，没有按照自愿互利政策处理社内的问题。去年种麦时，没有规定个办法就马马虎虎地种上了。当时社员李老锁提议：“社里应该研究研究记工办法，现在马马虎虎，将来会乱了套。”雷焕德不接受这个意见，他说：“大伙都不错，吃亏占便宜都不是外人，记工干什么？”原来雷焕德种着三十来亩地，只有他一个主要劳力，两个儿子干不了重活，他觉得记工就不能占便宜，所以不同意记工。种麦时，他一个人参加种麦，却叫两个儿子在家放猪，副社长雷喜道跟着社长走，也叫自己儿子在家放猪。这时社员们都不满意，贫农社员李五卯说：“大伙一块作活不记工，我们就够吃亏的了，他们还都叫自己的儿子在家放猪，这样我们实在受不了。”社长雷焕德听见了，就怒气冲冲地对李五卯说：“你愿意干就干，不愿意干就散。”
    去年秋后，这个社以社长雷焕德为首组织了一个木货厂。按说社里的副业，全体社员都参加才合理。但是雷焕德等却规定了一个限制办法：凡是不能拿“垫本”的都不能参加。当时规定每户拿八元。几户贫农如雷来喜、雷冬尔等，因为拿不起“垫本”，就被拒绝在木货厂以外。社里向国家银行贷款买的骡子，整冬为木货厂做工；被拒绝参加木货厂的贫农却要给贷款拿出同样多的利息。同时，贫农社员不能参加副业生产，就负担了社里极为繁重的农活。像雷冬尔就一连起了八个猪圈。但这些工都白搭了。
    落个“好离好散”
    春天到了，社里规定了记工制度。社长雷焕德觉得一记工，便宜就不好沾了，于是就串通中农户准备退社。在春耕播种的季节里，中农们有牲口有车，都尽量种自己的地，独独把贫农的地剩下了。贫农雷来喜的四亩地，一直留着很长的大车道（因为种晚了就被轧成大车道）。
    整顿巩固农业生产合作社的工作开始了。雷焕德等中农社员坚决要退社。但是，雷焕德又觉得光自己和一些中农社员退出去，如果还有人继续办社，那不显得自己落后吗？于是就去动员别人也退社。他曾召集贫农骨干李五卯和党员李老锁等开会说：“咱们再不散我可上山西啦。”李老锁说：“你走了我们还得办。”雷焕德和雷选拴光动员李五卯退社就不下三、四次，但李五卯坚决不退社。
    在这个期间，县、区工作组的工作人员、乡的工作人员和本社的贫农骨干，始终如一地贯彻了对中农的团结教育方针。中共乡总支曾用了十二天的时间，对他们进行了社会主义前途教育，讲明了自愿互利政策。他们所提的问题一个个都得到了解决。但最后他们还是坚决退社了。在这些中农社员退社时，贫农社员们表示：一定坚决把社办好。社员李五卯说：“共产党领导我们翻了身，社会主义的道路咱们不走叫谁走？再说，过去单干时缺牲口少车的痛苦我是尝够了，我不愿再退回去走那个苦道儿了。”下中农雷顺道也说：“土地改革后我们的生活改善了，但现在生产上还有困难，要想摆脱困难，不办社是不行的，我要跟着社走。”党员李老锁像宣誓一样地表示：我是一个共产党员，不怕任何困难，只要大家努力，咱们一定能把这个小社办好。他被大家推选当了社长。
    没有过不去的“火焰山”
    这时候，东王庄的人们对这个新诞生的小社议论纷纷，大家共同的看法是：“缺牲口、少车、家底空，一定长不了。”
    的确，这个小社面临很多困难。就在这最困难的时候，党的总支对这个小社的问题进行了研究，并确定总支委员李忠尔、雷银雪对他们进行具体领导。李忠尔曾用了两天的时间，帮助他们作出了全年的生产计划。这个小社的春耕生产开始了，当时社里就只有雷顺道的一匹小骡子，瘦得卧倒起不来。有一付车下脚没有上装。社长李老锁找党总支商量，总支书记雷九维说：“别遭难，把我的车上装安上，我们社里用不着。”贫农雷新喜（同李五卯住在一个院）听说后，慷慨地说：“别安啦，就使我们这个车吧。”车的问题解决了。再看播种的任务吧：原来退社的中农们早就安排好了“巧计划”，他们自己的春白地早已播种完毕啦。这个小社的三十二亩地，还给留下十七亩没有播种。社员们决心克服这个困难，耕地时小骡子拉不动耠子，就一个人用力推，一个人帮着骡子拉。有一次，社长李老锁套上小骡子赶着耕甘薯地。地干土硬，人、牲口用尽全力耕着。中午回来，人累得吃不下饭去，牲口累得不吃草了。就这样跌倒了爬起来，一块又一块地把十七亩春白地种上了。在这青黄不接的时候，人缺吃的，牲口没有草喂。社长李老锁东挪西借还是没有办法，又去找党总支。总支委员李忠尔除给他们赊了四百斤干草外，还借给他们二十元，并鼓励他们说：“你们刚组织起来，家底空，困难是难免的，只要大家齐心协力，困难是一定能克服的。”
    六月的天气，烈日无情地照射着东王庄的“瞪眼沙”地，庄稼旱得拧成了绳。这个农业生产合作社的社员们为了战胜旱象，像上火线一样，不分昼夜地浇地。小骡子拉不动水车，人帮着它拉。骡子累得卧倒了，就干脆换上人来拉。地薄沙干，他们一直浇了两、三个月。
    麦收后，锄苗、浇地、栽甘薯等农活都堆成了疙瘩，就在这时候，这个社的主要劳力李五卯得了病。李老锁是这乡人民委员会的秘书，忙着作小麦征购工作。雷顺道还得急着锄苗。五、六亩甘薯眼看着栽不上。只好发动全社四个妇女带着七个孩子下地去栽甘薯。这村妇女还没养成参加田间生产的习惯，不会栽。五卯只好带着病，同她们一块下地。他一面教给妇女们剪蔓插秧技术，一面还得看管七个孩子。五、六亩麦茬甘薯，就这样按时插了秧。栽完了甘薯，却欠下了五元的甘薯秧款。人家要得紧了，他们实在拿不出现款来，就派雷顺道去找总支委员李忠尔想办法。李忠尔把自己社里的款借给他们五元还了账。
    还是他们胜利了
    事实并没有按照东王庄一些人的想法发展；而是按照党指示的道路和这个社社员们的希望前进，他们胜利了。
    东王庄有些单干农民因为缺乏人力、畜力，在天旱不雨的情况下，不少的庄稼旱坏了。这个小社，由于全体社员兢兢业业、克服一切困难，坚持了昼夜轮浇，没有旱坏一块庄稼。玉米浇了五、六水，保住了每亩二百四、五十斤的收成。他们栽的十三亩甘薯，好的每亩能收二千斤，今年秋后，总共将有二万斤的好收成。三亩花生和其他庄稼也长得不错。他们还栽了一亩茄子，现在已卖了六十多元，预计能卖八十多元。这些钱除开支社里一年的零用外，还能归还一部分贷款。去年，他们四户在互助组时，只收了八千八百五十四斤原粮；今年，根据已收的粮食和未收的庄稼正确地估算了一下，他们将收原粮一万三千三百多斤，比去年多收四千多斤原粮。贫农社员李五卯去年只收了一千六百多斤原粮，今年将收三千斤左右。中农社员雷顺道去年打的粮食不够吃，今年光甘薯预计就能收八千多斤，他将过上富裕的生活。但是退了社的农民雷狗把因天旱、劳力弱，再加家里有病人，比去年少收一千三百多斤原粮。他后悔说：“我要不退社，怎么也不致少收这些粮食。”你要问李五卯他们社里今年的年景怎么样？他会笑眯眯地告诉你：“要不是把社坚决办下来，想也想不到今年的好收成。”雷新喜的婶母羡慕地说：“那会，谁都说这个小穷社长不了，现在人家硬把‘死社’办活了。”
