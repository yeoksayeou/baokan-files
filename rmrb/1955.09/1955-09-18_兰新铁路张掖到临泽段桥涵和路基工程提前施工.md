    Bridge, Culvert, and Roadbed Engineering on the Zhangye-Linze Section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Advances Ahead of Schedule

    The bridge, culvert, and 37-kilometer roadbed engineering on the Zhangye-Linze section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway have begun ahead of schedule.

    The Zhangye-Linze area is an oasis on the Gobi Desert, and the railway line here will pass through a lake area with a total length of eight kilometers and the six-kilometer-wide Heihe River. This section of the railway was originally scheduled for full-scale construction next year.

    Now, thousands of railway construction workers are digging drainage ditches in the lake area to drain the accumulated water from the swamps, and then using the "soil replacement and stone filling" method to build a solid roadbed. Workers building the Heihe River Bridge overcame the difficulties of rising floodwaters and erected a floating bridge for transportation on the rapid current. They also used damming to prevent water, ensuring the safety of the No. 1 pier construction.

    In order to ensure the opening to traffic to Yumen next year, railway construction workers began preparations for construction west of Zhangye in July. Now this section of the project has become the current construction focus of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.

### 兰新铁路张掖到临泽段桥涵和路基工程提前施工

    兰新铁路张掖到临泽段桥涵和路基工程提前施工
    兰新铁路张掖到临泽间的桥涵和三十七公里的路基工程，已提前施工。
    张掖到临泽一带是戈壁滩上的绿洲，铁路线在这里要穿过总长八公里的湖滩地带和六公里宽的黑河。这段铁路原计划要到明年全面施工。
    现在数千个筑路工人在湖滩地带挖掘一条条的排水沟，把湖沼中的积水排出，然后用“换土填石”的方法修筑起坚固的路基。修筑黑河大桥的工人克服了洪水上涨的困难，在急流上架起一座运输用的浮桥。他们还用筑坝挡水的方法，保证一号桥墩的施工安全。
    筑路工人为了保证明年通车到玉门，七月里就开始了张掖以西的施工准备工作。现在这一段工程已成为兰新路目前的施工重点了。
