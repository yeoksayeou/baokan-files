Militia Captain Hong Shunli and His Comrades
Huang Ling, Zhou Tingnan

On an island at the very forefront of Fujian's coastal defense, there is a brave militia team. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Party, this militia team has actively carried out struggles against the enemy. They have heroically cooperated with the troops to capture sea bandits, launched political offensives against the enemy, and made outstanding contributions in defending the motherland and supporting the liberation of Taiwan.

The captain of this militia team is Hong Shunli, the deputy secretary of the island's Communist Youth League branch. Not long ago, we visited Hong Shunli and his comrades.

"For six years, Chiang Kai-shek has regarded our small island as a thorn in his side. They have tried to destroy us several times, but we are still living with our heads held high." As Hong Shunli spoke, he led us to see their village. "In the year of liberation, you couldn't see a single complete house here, nor could you find many intact fishing boats. The houses were all destroyed by the enemy's planes and artillery fire, and the fishing boats were all dragged to Kinmen by the enemy on the day of liberation. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government's help and relief over the past few years, we wouldn't have dreamed of having such a life today." When this young man spoke these words, his eyes flashed with hatred for the enemy and love for the life after liberation.

Never Let a Single Special Agent Escape

On the morning of the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1952, Hong Shunli and his comrades Hong Tiansheng, Hong Kunying, and Wu Yi sailed out to sea to catch sharks.

The weather was clear that day, and the fishing boat moved briskly against the rising sun. As usual, Hong Shunli squatted at the bow of the boat, covering his forehead with his hand to block the sunlight, and widened his eagle-like sharp eyes, vigilantly observing the movements on the sea surface.

Suddenly, there were two black dots on the sea near Kinmen, floating towards this side with the waves, rising and falling. After Hong Shunli noticed them, he stood up abruptly.

"What's the situation?" The comrades on the boat immediately became alert. Everyone stared at the two strange black dots on the sea one or two nautical miles away in the direction Hong Shunli pointed.

"It must be the enemy sending special agents again." Hong Shunli made a judgment based on his past experience of catching five sea bandits at sea.

"It looks like they are definitely special agents from Kinmen. Let's go back and report to the troops quickly." A comrade said anxiously.

However, it was seven or eight nautical miles from here to the troops on their island, and it would take more than an hour to go back and forth. If they rushed back at this time, the special agents might take the opportunity to slip away. Hong Shunli considered the current situation and remembered the Party's call to the militia not long ago: "Absolutely no enemy can be let go, absolutely no special agent can be allowed to climb up!" Therefore, he said decisively to his comrades: "The special agents are already in front of us. If we go back to report to the troops, they will definitely slip away; if we don't want them to slip away, we have to catch them ourselves."

"Okay, let's do it ourselves!"

"But we don't have any weapons. If the enemy has guns, how will we deal with them?" Wu Yi's face showed hesitation, and he asked in a low voice.

This question stumped everyone. Hong Shunli's eyes suddenly fell on the two large fishhooks lying in the cabin. These two fishhooks were equipped with wooden handles four feet long and could hook sharks weighing hundreds of pounds from the sea. Hong Shunli suddenly felt that he had a weapon to defeat the enemy. He grabbed the shark hook in his hand and said loudly, "We didn't bring guns, so let's rely on these two big iron hooks!"

When the comrades saw these two shiny big iron hooks, they were also filled with confidence. Hong Shunli directed everyone to row the boat behind a large reef nearby.

The two special agents floated closer and closer. Hong Shunli waved his hand suddenly, and the small boat rushed out from behind the reef like an arrow. The four of them shouted in unison: "Don't move, surrender your guns and you won't be killed!"

The two guys were taken aback by this sudden attack and hurriedly threw away the planks they were using for swimming, desperately plunging their heads into the water, trying to turn around and escape. When Hong Shunli saw the special agents, his eyes were ablaze with fire, and he was not willing to let them escape. While directing his comrades to row the boat forward, he searched for the fleeing enemy in the waves with his sharp eyes. After a while, the two special agents couldn't hold back in the water and had to stick their heads out to breathe. At this time, the boat had chased up to them. Hong Shunli and Hong Kunying stood at the bow of the boat, raised their big iron hooks, and shouted sternly: "Surrender quickly, if you escape again, we will take your dog lives!" Seeing that they could no longer escape, one of the special agents raised his two pale hands, kicking his feet in the water. Hong Shunli and Hong Kunying hurriedly lunged forward and pulled him up with all their strength. At this time, the other special agent was still drilling around in the water, struggling in an attempt to escape. The warriors on the boat used their iron-clamp-like hands to grab the guy alive. After interrogation, it turned out that these two guys were special agents sent by the Chiang gang from Taiwan to Kinmen, attempting to sneak into the mainland to carry out sabotage activities.

This deed of using iron hooks to catch sea bandits inspired the fighting spirit of the entire island's militia. By July of this year, Hong Shunli and the militiamen had captured fifty-two Chiang bandit soldiers floating over from the sea in coordination with the troops.

Psychological Warfare on the Coastal Defense Front

One dark night in September 1953, Hong Shunli took several militia comrades out to sea again to drop propaganda materials. They wanted to tell the Chiang bandit soldiers on Kinmen Island about the victory of our army in the Dongshan battle and the lenient treatment of prisoners. In addition to militia deputy captain Hong Wenmei and militiamen Hong Maqiao and Hong Tiansheng, Hong Shunli's younger brother Hong Shunqin also went to sea with Hong Shunli this time.

"Prepare to release!" When the boat reached the edge of a reef near Kinmen, Hong Shunli gave the order in a low voice. So, everyone quickly untied the sacks and put the sealed bamboo tubes into the sea one by one. The bamboo tubes were filled with pictures, newspapers, and letters for propaganda against the enemy, and they quickly drifted towards the beaches of the enemy-occupied island with the tide.

At this time, the sound of a gun being cocked and a shout came from the shore: "Who's there!" Then there were footsteps from near to far, and then it became silent again.

Obviously, the enemy sentries had discovered the situation and returned to report. At this critical moment, Hong Shunli thought of the instructions from the Communist Party organization and the work team comrades when they set off: "You must be brave, calm, and resolute to complete this task." So, he directed the comrades on the boat to immediately load their guns and grenades, prepare for battle, and seize the time to continue dropping propaganda materials.

After a while, chaotic whistles sounded on the island, lights lit up in more than a dozen pillboxes, and the enemy began to assemble. But at this time, the propaganda materials on the boat had not been released yet. Should they release them all or go back? Hong Shunli thought that they were entrusted by the Party organization and the masses to come here, so they must complete the task before returning. The comrades on the boat also had this determination, so everyone took advantage of the last moment before the enemy arrived and quickly released all the propaganda materials.

By the time the enemy shouted and rushed to the shore, their small boat had already left Kinmen beach and was sailing victoriously on the vast sea.

Over the years, the hundreds of thousands of propaganda materials released by Hong Shunli and his comrades have blossomed in the hearts of the enemy like countless shells. In July alone of this year, three Chiang bandit soldiers swam to this island with gasoline barrels and surrendered to our People's Liberation Army.

Night Attack on Kinmen Island

One day in August 1954, the secretary of the Communist Party District Committee entrusted Hong Shunli with an important and confidential task of supporting the front: he was to row a boat to send reconnaissance troops to launch a night attack on the Chiang bandit army on Kinmen Island.

However, the designated landing site was an unfamiliar place that Hong Shunli had never been to. The water there was turbulent and there were many reefs. Hong Shunli did not easily make a guarantee to the District Committee Secretary, but asked to understand the situation. So he and the comrades of the troops ran to observe the terrain on the opposite bank, measure the speed of the water flow, and detect the recent wind direction.

It was already the night before the scheduled departure, and the District Committee Secretary came to see if Hong Shunli was ready. The District Committee Secretary walked into Hong Shunli's house, and Hong Shunli was staring blankly at a candle stuck on the table. Some books and pictorials were scattered and propped up on the table, one by one. Suddenly, Hong Shunli pulled out the candle and moved it back and forth in the gaps between the books and newspapers. The District Committee Secretary understood that in front of Hong Shunli were not books and candles, but the vast sea with protruding reefs and turbulent currents. He wanted to find a safe channel and landing point for his boat carrying the reconnaissance soldiers. He did not dare to disturb him.

Suddenly, Hong Shunli jumped up excitedly: "It's okay, we can land!" He suddenly turned around and realized that the District Committee Secretary was there. He gave the District Committee Secretary the guarantee that he "will definitely complete the task."

On August 23, it was the second day that the democratic parties and people's organizations across the country issued a joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan. At night, a group of vigorous reconnaissance soldiers stepped onto the sailboat driven by Hong Shunli and set off for Kinmen Island.

On the boat, Hong Shunli helped a reconnaissance soldier steer the boat while discerning the forward water flow and direction with his sharp eyes. The sea was quiet, and the sailboat crossed a dangerous shoal and then a turbulent backflow. In less than two hours, the boat approached Kinmen and quietly docked in front of the cliff. Hong Shunli inserted the bamboo pole, and the soldiers jumped into the sea one by one and swam ashore nimbly. Then, they quickly built a human ladder in front of the cliff and climbed up one by one.

Now there were only four people left on the boat. Three were soldiers performing liaison tasks, and one was Hong Shunli.

In the tense and unbearable silence, half an hour passed, and there was no movement. An hour, two hours passed, and the tide had receded very low. Many reef heads had been exposed in front of and behind the boat. Hong Shunli and the soldiers calmly waited for the victory of the reconnaissance soldiers.

Around midnight, a flash of fire suddenly appeared on the shore, followed by a burst of gunfire and explosions. At this time, the soldiers on the boat excitedly told Hong Shunli, "They have successfully completed the task, let's quickly bring the boat ashore to meet them."

Hong Shunli waved the scull, the soldiers loaded the oars, and rowed forward vigorously. However, after only a dozen steps, there was a "gulu gulu" sound, and the boat could not move as if it was clamped by iron pliers. Hong Shunli hurriedly looked down and saw that the boat was blocked by dense oyster rocks all around. Three soldiers jumped into the sea and pushed the oyster rocks in front of the boat with all their might, but after pushing a few, their hands and feet were scratched by the oyster shells and bled profusely, and the boat still could not move forward. At this time, the enemy's gunfire rang out from the shore, becoming more and more intense. Obviously, at this moment, the key to the entire victory was whether this boat could bring the reconnaissance soldiers back to the defense area. In a hurry, Hong Shunli gritted his teeth, picked up the large oar and ran to the bow of the boat, put it on the oar post, and used all his strength to pry the oar wood towards the oyster rocks. Suddenly, there was a "gulu gulu" sound, and a row of oyster rocks fell down. The boat moved forward with difficulty. He pried again, and there was a "gulu gulu" sound, and the boat moved forward again. "Okay!" Seeing that this method was effective, the soldiers immediately jumped on the boat and also used wooden oars to pry. For a while, there was only a "gulu gulu" sound, and hundreds of sharp-edged oyster rocks had fallen down in rows. Although the people on the boat were drenched in sweat, the boat finally docked. The landing soldiers happened to arrive at the coast at this time. They sent the captured prisoners and spoils onto the boat, and then waded and boarded the boat one by one. Hong Shunli propped the bamboo pole, turned the rudder, and the boat quickly sailed away from Kinmen beach along the original navigation route.

More than twenty minutes later, Hong Shunli's boat had sailed three or four miles away from Kinmen. While the heroes on the boat were smoking, drinking tea, and chatting and laughing, there were still chaotic shouts and gunshots from Kinmen Island. They shouted to the enemy, "You don't need to fire cannons to see us off."

This time, the reconnaissance heroes wiped out an enemy squad and captured a prisoner alive. Two days later, this victorious news of the "Night Attack on Kinmen Island" appeared in newspapers all over the country.

    民兵队长洪顺利和他的伙伴们
    黄岺　周挺南
    在福建省海防最前哨的一个岛上，有一支勇敢的民兵队。五年来，这支民兵队在党的领导下，积极地开展了对敌斗争。他们英勇地配合部队抓海匪，开展对敌政治攻势，在保卫祖国和支援解放台湾的斗争中，作出了出色的贡献。
    这支民兵队的队长，就是岛上的青年团支部副书记洪顺利。不久以前，我们访问了洪顺利和他的伙伴们。
    “六年来，蒋介石把我们这个小岛看成眼中钉，他们好几次想摧毁我们，但我们还是挺着腰板生活着。”洪顺利一边说，一边带我们看他们的村子。“刚解放那年，这里看不到一座完整的房子，也找不到几艘完好的渔船，房子全给敌人的飞机大炮炸毁了，渔船在临解放那天也全被敌人拉到金门去了。要是没有共产党、人民政府这几年的帮助和救济，就是做梦也想不到有今天这日子。”这个年轻人讲这些话的时候，眼睛里闪灼着对敌人的仇恨和对翻身后的生活的热爱。
      决不让一个特务逃跑
   一九五二年中秋节前一天的早晨，洪顺利和他的伙伴洪天胜、洪昆英、吴益一道，驶船出海去捕鲨鱼。
    这天天气晴朗，渔船迎着初升的太阳轻快地行进。跟往常一样，洪顺利蹲在船头，用手覆在额上挡住阳光，睁大一双鹰一般锐利的眼睛，警惕地观察海面的动静。
    突然，在靠近金门的海面上有两个黑点，随着波浪一高一低地向这边浮来，洪顺利发觉后，就霍地站了起来。
    “发现了什么情况？”同船的伙伴也立即警觉起来。大家朝着洪顺利指点的方向，在一、二浬远的海面上，用眼盯住了那两个奇怪的黑点。
    “一定又是敌人派特务来了。”洪顺利根据过去在海上抓到五个海匪的经验，下了判断。
    “看样子准是金门过来的特务，我们赶快回去报告部队。”一个伙伴急忙说。
    可是，这里离开自己岛上的部队有七、八浬，来回得一个多钟头，如果这时候赶回去，很可能让特务乘机溜跑。洪顺利考虑着眼前的情况，想起了不久以前党对民兵的号召：“绝对不能把一个敌人放过去，绝对不能让一个特务爬上来！”于是，他斩钉截铁地对伙伴们说：“现在特务已在我们眼前，如果我们回去报告部队，准会让他们溜跑；要不让他们溜跑，我们就要自己来抓。”
    “好，我们自己动手！”
    “可是我们没有武器，要是敌人带枪，我们怎么对付呢？”吴益的脸上显露着迟疑的神色，低声问。
    这个问题倒把大家难住了。洪顺利的眼光忽然落到了躺在舱里的两把大鱼钩上。这两把鱼钩，装着四尺来长的木柄，可以从海里钩起成百斤重的鲨鱼。洪顺利顿时觉得有了战胜敌人的武器，他把鲨鱼钩抓在手里，大声地说：“我们没有带枪，就靠这两把大铁钩吧！”
    伙伴们一见这两把闪闪发亮的大铁钩，也都充满了信心。洪顺利指挥大家把船划到了附近的一块大礁石背后。
    两个特务越浮越近了。洪顺利猛的一挥手，小船就从礁石后面像箭似的冲了出去，四个人一齐喝道：“不许动，缴枪不杀！”
    那两个家伙遇到这突如其来的袭击，大吃一惊，慌忙抛掉泅水用的木板，拼命把头钻进水里，想转身逃跑。洪顺利一见特务，眼里冒火，那肯放他们逃走。他一边指挥伙伴把船划上前去，一边用锐利的目光在海浪中搜索逃窜的敌人。不一会，那两个特务在水里忍不住了，只好伸出头来喘气。这时，船已追到他们身旁，洪顺利和洪昆英站在船头，举起大铁钩，厉声喝道：“赶快投降，再逃就要你们的狗命！”特务眼看再也逃不掉了，其中一个就举起了两只苍白的手，两脚在水里乱蹬。洪顺利和洪昆英赶忙扑下身去，猛力把他拉了上来。这时另一个特务还在水里乱钻，挣扎着企图逃跑。船上的勇士们用铁箝似的双手，一下就把这家伙活活地攫上船来了。经过审讯，原来这两个家伙是蒋贼从台湾派到金门，企图偷渡到大陆来进行破坏活动的特务。
    这次用铁钩抓海匪的事迹，鼓舞了全岛民兵的斗志。到今年七月，洪顺利和民兵们配合部队捕获的浮海过来的蒋贼军，已有五十二名了。
      海防前哨的攻心战
    在一九五三年九月的一个黑夜里，洪顺利带了几个民兵伙伴，又一次出海去放宣传品，他们要把我军在东山战斗中的胜利和宽待俘虏的情形告诉金门岛上的蒋贼军。这回和洪顺利一道出海的，除了民兵副队长洪文眉和民兵洪马桥、洪天胜，还有洪顺利的弟弟洪顺钦。
    “准备放”！当小船到达金门附近的海面一处礁石边沿，洪顺利轻声地下了命令。于是，大家就赶紧解开麻袋，把一个个密封好的竹筒放下海去。竹筒满装着对敌宣传的图片、报纸和信件，很快地顺着潮流向贼占岛的海滩飘去。
    这时，岸上突然传来了枪机声和一声叫喊：“哪一个！”接着又响起了由近而远的脚步声，然后又变得一片静寂。
    显然，敌人哨兵发现情况赶回报告去了。在这紧急的关头，洪顺利想到出发的时候共产党组织和工作组同志的嘱咐：“你们要勇敢、沉着、坚决，完成这次任务。”于是，他就指挥船上的伙伴，立即把枪弹上膛，把手榴弹盖掀开，做好战斗准备，同时抓紧时间继续投放宣传品。
    不一会，岛上响起了杂乱的哨子声，十几个碉堡眼里亮起了灯光，敌人开始集合了。但这时，船上的宣传品还没有放完，是放完呢还是回去？洪顺利想，我们受着党组织和群众的重托到这里来，就一定要完成任务才能回去。同船的伙伴也都有这个决心，于是大家就趁敌人还没有赶到的最后时机，迅速地把全部宣传品投放完了。
    等到敌人大喊大叫赶到岸边的时候，他们的小船已经远离金门海滩，在辽阔的海面上胜利返航了。
    几年来，经过洪顺利和他的伙伴们放出去的数十万份宣传品，就像无数颗炮弹在敌人的心里开了花。单是今年七月，就有三个蒋贼军抱着汽油筒泅到这个岛上，向我人民解放军投诚。
      夜袭金门岛
    一九五四年八月的一天，共产党区委书记把一项重要而机密的支前任务交给了洪顺利：要他划船送侦察部队去夜袭金门岛上的蒋贼军。
    可是，指定的登陆地点是洪顺利从来没有去过的陌生地方。那里水流急、礁石多。洪顺利没有轻易地向区委书记提出保证，而是要求去了解一下情况。于是他和部队同志一起跑去观察对岸的地形，测量水流的速度，探测近日的风向。
    已经到了预定出发的前一天晚上了，区委书记来看洪顺利是否已经做好了准备。区委书记走进洪顺利的房子，洪顺利正对着桌面上粘着的一支蜡烛在出神。一些书册、画报错落地一本本地支在桌子上，忽然洪顺利拔起那只蜡烛，在书报之间的空隙里穿来穿去。区委书记明白了，在洪顺利的面前不是书册和蜡烛，而是汪洋大海中密布着的突兀的礁石和湍急的水流，他要为他的载着侦察兵的小船找到安全的航道和靠岸地点。他没有敢惊动他。
    忽然，洪顺利兴奋地跳起来了：“行了，可以靠岸了！”他猛地一回身，这才发现了区委书记，他向区委书记提出了“一定能完成任务”的保证。
    八月二十三日，正是全国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾发出联合宣言的第二天；夜里，一群生龙活虎的侦察兵，踏上了洪顺利驾驶的帆船，朝着金门岛出发了。
    洪顺利在船上一边协助一个侦察兵掌舵，一边睁着犀利的眼睛辨别前进的水流和方向。海面静悄悄的，帆船越过一道险滩，又越过一道波浪汹涌的回流，不到两小时左右，船就靠近了金门，悄悄地在峭壁前面靠了岸。洪顺利把竹篙一插，战士们一个个跳下海，敏捷地游上岸去。接着，他们又迅速地在峭壁前搭起了人梯，一个个爬上去了。
    船上现在只留下四个人。三个是执行联络任务的战士，一个便是洪顺利。
    在紧张而又难耐的沉默中，半个钟头过去了，没有动静；一个钟头、两个钟头过去了，潮水已经退得很低了，船前船后已露出许多礁头。洪顺利和战士们冷静地等待侦察兵们的胜利。
    将近午夜时分，岸上突然闪起一道火光，接着是一阵枪声和爆炸声。这时，船上的战士兴奋地告诉洪顺利说：“他们胜利完成任务了，咱们赶快把船靠岸迎接他们。”
    洪顺利挥动船橹，战士们装上船桨，猛力地向前划去。可是，只划了十几步，“骨碌碌”一阵响，船像被铁钳钳住一样撑不动了。洪顺利急忙向下一看，原来前后左右尽是密密麻麻的海蛎石，把船挡住了。三个战士踪身跳到海里用手猛力推动船前的海蛎石，可是没有推几块，手脚都被蛎壳划得鲜血直流，船还是无法前进。这时，岸上敌人的枪声响起来了，一阵紧似一阵。显然，此刻整个胜利的关键，已经系在这条船能不能把侦察兵接返防地这一着了。洪顺利一急，把牙关一咬，拿起大橹奔向船头，把它往橹桩一套，用尽平生力气，硬把橹木朝海蛎石撬去。忽然，“骨碌碌”一阵响，一排海蛎石倒下去了。船艰难地前进了一大步，他再一撬，“骨碌碌”一阵响，船又前进一大步。“好了！”战士们见这个办法有效，立刻跳上船，也拿着木浆来撬。一时只听到一阵阵“骨碌碌”的响声，几百块尖棱棱的海蛎石，已经成排地倒下去了。船上的人虽然满身衣衫都被汗流湿透了，但船终于靠了岸。登陆的战士们刚巧也在这时赶到海岸，他们把抓到的俘虏和缴获品往船上一送，然后一个个都涉水跨上了船。洪顺利把竹篙一撑，舵一转，船便沿着原来开辟的航道，飞速地驶离金门海滩。
    二十多分钟后，洪顺利的船已经驶到离金门三四里以外了。当船上的英雄们正在抽烟、喝茶、说说笑笑的时候，金门岛上还传来一阵阵纷乱的喊声和枪声，他们向敌人喊道：“你们不用鸣炮欢送了。”
    这一回，侦察英雄们消灭了敌人一个班，活捉了一名俘虏。隔两天，这一条“夜袭金门岛”的胜利消息，就在全国各地的报纸上出现了。
