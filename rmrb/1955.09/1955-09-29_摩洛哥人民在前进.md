The Moroccan People Are Advancing
A Youth from Casablanca

Recently, people all over the world have been excitedly watching the news of the Moroccan people launching a new struggle to break free from the shackles of colonialism. I would like to take this rare opportunity to tell you about all aspects of the struggle that has in fact persisted for forty-eight years.

Morocco has more than 1,300 years of history and culture. Historically, it has never stopped bravely defending its independence and territorial integrity. Due to its important geographical location and rich underground resources and land, this country aroused the covetousness of European colonial countries, especially France, which had occupied Algeria in 1830 and Tunisia in 1881. As a result of the conspiracy and transaction of the colonialist group, France was able to do whatever it wanted in Morocco. From 1907, the colonialists sent invading troops to Morocco. The Moroccan people, with a glorious tradition of independence for thousands of years, naturally rose up to carry out armed resistance against the invaders. This heroic resistance struggle, although the enemy used new weapons and military technology and the forces were disparate, persisted for twenty-seven years. The Moroccan people lost the best sons and daughters of their motherland in the long war of resistance, but they did not succumb to it. On the contrary, their fighting will and national unity became stronger and more consolidated, despite the colonial authorities' best efforts to divide them and plunge them into poverty and ignorance.

In 1930, when some parts of the country were still waging war against the colonial troops, a large-scale national independence movement spread to all sectors of Moroccan society. In order to restore their national independence and sovereignty, the Moroccan people constantly demanded that negotiations be held between their qualified representatives and the French government. But every time they issued such appeals, issued statements, appeals or launched strikes to support their demands, the colonial authorities always responded with their usual violent repression. The dates of March 1937, January 1944, August 1947, November 1950, February 1951, December 1952, and August 1953 are all written in blood in the annals of the French protectorate in Morocco. Hundreds of thousands of patriots paid for their lives for their desire for independence, and hundreds of thousands more were imprisoned or exiled for demanding freedom rights. Nevertheless, the Moroccan people's fighting will has never been so strong, so united, especially after the French colonialists carried out a military coup in August 1953 in order to strengthen their colonial rule over Morocco. This made it even more convinced that the French government had no intention of negotiating, so the Moroccan people, first and foremost the working class, took up arms again. Along with the armed struggle, there were other forms of struggle, such as boycotting goods imported from France and other colonial countries or manufactured locally with French funds. Such economic struggles were particularly intense in the form of workers' strikes and shopkeepers' strikes. The most recent shopkeepers' strike lasted for seven weeks and spread to all cities in Morocco.

The Moroccan people are fighting for independence and for peace. They have constantly risen up against the construction of aggressive bases by the United States on their territory.

It would take many pages to describe the details of that admirable and growing struggle, but it would also take many pages to depict all the persecution crimes against Moroccan patriots that are no less brutal than those of the Nazis! They used machine guns to wound and kill thousands of residents in the streets; inhumane tortures were carried out in police stations; many patriots and innocent residents, many of whom were women and children, were killed in attacks by colonialist executioners; special courts were often opened to try cases and constantly sentenced people to death; prisons and concentration camps were overcrowded and executions were carried out one after another. But nothing can stifle the will of the Moroccan people, and although their most basic rights are deprived, they stand upright in the face of the oppressors without discouragement. For more than two years, they have entered a new stage of the liberation struggle, and their struggle is developing day by day. Even children aged eight to twelve have taken on tasks. For a year, in the major cities of Morocco, especially in Casablanca, people can see many children parading every day, shouting slogans such as "Long live Moroccan freedom and independence" along the streets. Needless to say, the police also shoot at them without hesitation. During the serious incidents that occurred in Casablanca in July of this year, I saw children aged twelve to fourteen participating in the construction of fortifications and the burning of utility poles.

The reason why the Moroccan people are carrying out the struggle against French colonialism, which is supported spiritually and materially by US and British imperialism, more and more bravely, and why they continue to frustrate the violent policies of the plunderers, is because they are more convinced than ever that their enemies are not invincible; it is because when they are fighting, the example of the people of other countries, especially the great Chinese people, overcoming the reactionary forces with courage and perseverance, constantly guides them forward like a beacon; It is because they are constantly learning and absorbing the experiences and lessons of the people who have been liberated every day; it is because they deeply feel the support and solidarity of the French people and all the people who advocate justice, freedom and peace, which was once again clearly expressed in Bandung due to the initiative of Premier Zhou Enlai. They know that victory is not far away, and the 600 million Chinese people have tolled the death knell of colonialism.

The Chinese people can be proud: they are the inexhaustible source of hope for the colonial people, especially the Moroccan people.

    摩洛哥人民在前进
    卡萨布兰卡一青年
    最近，全世界人民兴奋地注视着摩洛哥人民为挣脱殖民主义枷锁而展开新的斗争的消息。我愿意利用这个难得的机会，向你们叙述一下事实上已坚持了四十八年之久的斗争各方面的情况。
    摩洛哥有着一千三百多年的历史和文化，在历史上它就没有停止过勇猛地保卫自己的独立和领土完整。由于它的重要的地理位置以及丰富的地下资源和土地，这个国家在十九世纪末叶就引起了欧洲殖民国家，特别是已在一八三○年占领了阿尔及利亚和在一八八一年占领了突尼斯的法国所垂涎。殖民主义集团进行密谋和交易的结果，使法国得以在摩洛哥为所欲为。一九○七年起，殖民主义者就向摩洛哥出动了侵略军队。具有上千年光荣独立传统的摩洛哥人民自然而然地起来对侵略者进行武装反抗。这一个英勇反抗斗争，虽然因为敌人使用新式武器和军事技术而势力悬殊，还是坚持了二十七年之久。摩洛哥人民在长期抗战中丧失了最优秀的祖国儿女，但是他们并没有因而屈服。而且恰恰相反，他们的战斗意志和民族团结愈来愈坚强和巩固，尽管殖民当局想尽办法进行分化，并想使他们陷于贫穷和愚昧。
    一九三○年，当这个国家的部分地区仍然在进行着反对殖民军队的战争时，大规模的争取独立的民族运动蔓延到摩洛哥社会各阶层。摩洛哥人民为了恢复自己民族的独立和主权，不断要求由他们的有资格的代表同法国政府举行谈判。但是每一次当他们发出这样的呼声，发表声明、呼吁或发动罢工支持他们的要求行动的时候，殖民当局总是用他们所惯用的武力镇压来回答。一九三七年三月、一九四四年一月、一九四七年八月、一九五○年十一月、一九五一年二月、一九五二年十二月和一九五三年八月的日子，都用血字书写在法兰西保护国、在摩洛哥的编年史上。成千成万的爱国者为了独立的愿望付出了他们的生命，另外成千成万人为了要求自由权利被囚在监狱中或者被放逐。尽管如此，摩洛哥人民的斗争意志从来没有这样的坚强，这样的团结一致，特别是在一九五三年八月法国殖民者为了加强对摩洛哥的殖民统治而进行武力政变以后。这就使人更加确信，法国政府并无意进行谈判，于是摩洛哥人民，首先是工人阶级就再次拿起了武器。和武装斗争同时进行的，还有着其他的斗争方式，例如抵制法国和其他殖民国家进口的或用法国资金在当地制造的货物。这样的经济斗争，以工人罢工和商店罢市进行得尤其激烈。最近一次商店罢市坚持了七个星期，遍及摩洛哥所有的城市。
    摩洛哥人民在为争取独立而斗争，同时也在为争取和平而斗争。他们不停地起来反对美国在他们领土上修建侵略基地。
    要描述那个日益加强的令人敬仰的斗争的详细情况是需要许多篇幅的，但是要描绘出每天施之于摩洛哥爱国者身上的残暴不下于纳粹分子的全部迫害罪行，也需要多少的篇幅呵！他们在大街上开机关枪杀伤数以千计的居民；警察署中施行着惨无人道的酷刑，许许多多爱国者和无辜居民，其中许多是妇女和儿童，在殖民主义刽子手的攻击下被杀害；特别法庭经常开审，不停地宣判死刑；监狱和集中营挤满了人，处决接连不断地进行。但是没有任何东西能够扼杀摩洛哥人民的意志，虽然他们最起码的权利都被剥夺，他们却毫不气馁地直立在压迫者的面前。两年多以来他们进入了解放斗争的新阶段，他们的斗争一天一天地在发展。连八岁到十二岁的儿童也担当起了任务。一年来，人们在摩洛哥各大城市，特别是在卡萨布兰卡，每天都可以看到许多儿童列队游行，沿街高呼“摩洛哥自由独立万岁”的口号。不用说，警察对于他们也是毫不犹豫地开枪的。我在今年七月在卡萨布兰卡发生的严重事件的时候，曾看见十二岁到十四岁的儿童们在参加修筑防御工事和焚毁电线杆。
    摩洛哥人民所以愈来愈勇猛地进行反对在精神上和物质上都受到美英帝国主义支持的法国殖民主义的斗争，他们所以继续不断地使掠夺者的暴力政策归于失败，这是因为他们比任何时候都更加坚信，他们的敌人并不是不可战胜的；这是因为在他们进行斗争的时候，其他国家的人民，特别是伟大的中国人民以勇气和坚韧不拔的精神战胜反动势力的范例，时时刻刻都像一盏明灯一样指引着他们前进的道路；这是因为他们每天都在不断地学习和吸取已经获得了解放的人民的经验和教训；这是因为他们深深感受到法国人民和一切主张正义自由与和平的人民的支持以及和他们的团结，这种团结最近在万隆由于周恩来总理的倡议而再一次明白地表现出来。他们知道胜利已在不远，六亿中国人民已敲响了殖民主义的丧钟。
    中国人民可以引为自豪：他们是殖民地人民，特别是摩洛哥人民的希望的无尽的泉源。
