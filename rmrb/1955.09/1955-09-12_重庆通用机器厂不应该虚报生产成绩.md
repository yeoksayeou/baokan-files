    Chongqing General Machinery Factory Should Not Falsify Production Achievements
    First Ministry of Machine Building, Chongqing Office
    The work group of the First Ministry of Machine Building's Chongqing Office stationed at Chongqing General Machinery Factory, recently, together with the factory's Party General Branch, Trade Union, and Supervision Office, conducted a preliminary inspection of the 218 commodities completed by the factory from January to May this year. They found that 33 items should not have been reported as commodities but were reported as such. Some were cases of unqualified products being reported as qualified products and thus reported as commodities; others were cases of unfinished products being reported as finished products and thus reported as commodities. For example, a set of ash removers produced in March had a portion of the components completed in March and delivered to the customer, while the remaining portion was processed in May and June. However, the entire set was reported as commodity value in March. The No. 6 centrifugal blower produced in May, due to a last-minute rush to meet targets at the end of the month, was not completed. By June 1st, four units still had their air outlets without reaming and screw holes undrilled; the axial flow fan was painted only on May 31st by hired temporary workers, and the painting wasn't finished until June 10th. These products were all reported as May commodities. In these five months, a total of 1,027 man-hours were not completed in the current month and were carried over to the next month.
    In addition, some products had been put into the warehouse, but the accessories had not been installed; some had been reported as commodities, but the products could not be found in the warehouse; some, in order to catch up with production value, were tested while being painted, resulting in peeling paint; some products were already completed, but the designs were still being modified.
    The serious situation of Chongqing General Machinery Factory falsifying achievements is mainly due to the serious complacency and bourgeois management style of the factory's leading staff. The factory's management is very chaotic, work is slow, and there is a lack of strict systems. Operational plans cannot be implemented, and scheduling work cannot regulate production. Departmental work is disconnected from workshop work, the production process cannot be well-connected, technical preparation is incomplete, and problems arising in production are not resolved at the beginning of the month but are dragged on until the end of the month, resulting in last-minute overtime work to piece together products. However, the factory's leading staff does not actively take measures to improve management to eliminate this chaotic phenomenon but instead uses various fraudulent methods, even resorting to the vile practice of "collective discussion and approval," to deceive superiors and obtain "honor."
    "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked." The staff of the planning department and inspection department also fail to adhere to statistical systems and inspection systems. For example, at the end of May, the air outlets of four No. 6 centrifugal blowers were not reamed properly, but the inspector signed the warehouse entry form, considering them qualified and allowing them to leave the factory; the planning department, knowing that the processing was not complete, consciously reported them as commodities.
    What is even more serious is that when these problems were discovered, the factory's chief engineer still believed that the "requirements were too high"; the head of the planning department even said that "family scandals should not be aired," believing that such inspections would "affect the morale of cadres"!
    We believe that such serious deception of the state by Chongqing General Machinery Factory cannot continue. The factory's leaders should lead the relevant staff in conducting a thorough inspection, investigating responsibilities, and correcting the behavior of falsifying production achievements.

    重庆通用机器厂不应该虚报生产成绩
    第一机械工业部重庆办事处
    第一机械工业部重庆办事处驻重庆通用机器厂工作组，最近会同这个厂的党总支、工会、监察室，对这个厂今年一至五月完成的二百一十八件商品进行了初步检查，发现有三十三件不应该报作商品而报了商品。有的是把不合格的产品当作合格品报成商品；有的是把没有加工完的产品当作完工产品报了商品。如三月份出产的一套消灰器，有一部分在三月份加工完毕，交给了订户，有一部分在五、六月才加工，但他们在三月份就报了全套商品值。五月份生产的六号离心式鼓风机，月底突击赶任务没有赶出来，到六月一日还有四台出风口没有铰孔，螺丝眼没有钻好；轴流式送风机到五月三十一日才雇临时工来加班油漆，一直到六月十日才油漆完。这些产品也全部作为五月份商品上报了。这五个月里，当月没有作完，移到下月补作的工时，一共有一千零二十七小时。
    此外，有的产品已入了库，但附件没有装上；有的已报了商品，在库房里却找不到产品；有的因为赶产值，一边试车一边油漆，结果油漆脱落了；有的产品已经完工，还在修改设计。
    重庆通用机器厂虚报成绩的情况这样严重，主要是由于这个厂的领导工作人员有严重的骄傲自满情绪和资产阶级的经营作风。这个厂的管理很混乱，工作拖拉，缺乏严格的制度。作业计划不能贯彻执行，调度工作也不能调节生产。科室工作同车间工作脱节，生产过程不能很好地衔接，技术准备不齐全，生产中有了问题月初不解决，拖到月底，只好加班突击，拼拼凑凑地勉强装出产品。但是，这个厂的领导工作人员不积极采取措施，改进管理，来消除这种混乱现象，而是不择手段地用各种虚假办法，甚至以“集体讨论通过”的恶劣作法，来欺骗上级，骗取“荣誉”。
    “上梁不正下梁歪”，计划科和检查科的工作人员也不坚持统计制度和检查制度。例如五月底有四台六号离心式鼓风机的出风口铰孔没有做好，可是检验员竟在入库单上签了字，认为合格，准予出厂；计划科明知没有加工完，也有意识地给报了商品。
    更严重的是当这些问题被检查出来以后，这个厂的总工程师还认为“要求过高”；计划科长还说“家丑不可外扬”，认为这样检查会“影响干部情绪”！
    我们认为重庆通用机器厂这种严重的对国家的欺骗行为，不能再继续下去了。这个厂的领导人员应该领导有关的工作人员进行一次深入的检查，追查责任，纠正虚报生产成绩的行为。
