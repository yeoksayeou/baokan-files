    Judging from the recent Soviet children's films, they are touching upon a wider range of subjects. They not only depict the lives of children at school and at home, but also prominently feature the social life of children. This kind of real life is familiar to children. Through this depiction, these films show the excellent qualities and lively personalities of children, providing broad masses of children with a profound and specific education.
    The Soviet children's film "Son of a Partisan" has made more significant progress in this respect. It tells us that what Soviet children think and do today is closely linked to the country's communist construction. The story is about the family of an old partisan, Yakub. His son and daughter-in-law both bravely sacrificed themselves in the Patriotic War, leaving behind two children, a girl named Olesya and a boy named Mikhail. Mikhail is a young student at the Suvorov Military School who returns home during the summer vacation. Together with his sister, he hears a story told by his grandmother, learning how his parents gloriously sacrificed themselves to defend the motherland. They listened to the old grandfather playing familiar partisan songs on his accordion, imagining the arduous battles between the partisans and the enemy at that time, while also arousing a deep hatred for the enemy. The film begins from here, taking us into the world of children.
    Mikhail and his sister Olesya are able to become brave and strong Soviet youths because the excellent qualities of their parents educated them, and they truly inherited the heroic patriotic spirit of their parents. There are many examples of this kind of real-life education giving children extraordinary influence in the Soviet Union. The film successfully portrays the heroic images of these two children. Mikhail often seriously and amusingly demands of himself the responsibilities of a soldier. He wants his grandfather to take him to the dangerous Volokhov area. He introduces himself as having been trained and being very agile, thinking that this would get his grandfather's agreement, but his grandfather still didn't agree. Olesya is also brave and lively, happy to take care of her younger brother, believing that she knows more than Mikhail. In fact, Mikhail doesn't know any less than she does. For example, she shows Mikhail a gun that she has carefully preserved, saying it is a gun that can shoot enemy tanks, but Mikhail recognizes at a glance that it is a signal gun. They often argue about such things, but this further shows the loving feelings between the siblings.
    They know that they should be vigilant against the enemy, but children are, after all, children. They do not have the rich experience of adults to distinguish between good and bad people. Especially against those hidden enemies, they are even less likely to see through them. Therefore, when they find a roll of film in the combat shelter used by the partisans, and discover that it contains secrets, they automatically tell Grushko and the fake photographer, two enemies, about this secret. They never expected that the enemy was worried about losing this roll of film. Later, the traitor Grushko lures them into a mud pit. Mikhail takes off his soaked pants, with the roll of film clearly hidden in the pocket, but he trusts the traitor Grushko enough to hand over his pants. By the time Mikhail and Olesya discover that Grushko is a despicable villain, they have fallen into a dangerous situation. But that's how children are; once they recognize what is right and wrong, their attitude is very clear and firm. They hate Grushko to the core, seeing him as worse than a dog. Olesya believes that her dog Anchar will not leave them in danger. She said to Mikhail: "You don't understand Anchar, he can't leave, he's not like Grushko." Filled with unparalleled hatred, Mikhail uses a small knife to carve "Grushko is a traitor" on many trees in the forest, frightening the traitor Grushko. He put in a lot of effort but still couldn't completely eliminate these marks, so he viciously set fire to burn down the entire forest. From this, we can see how much these two children hate the traitor who betrayed the interests of the motherland. They also alertly recall that it was this traitor Grushko who betrayed the partisans. Therefore, they feel it is their responsibility to take back that roll of film and expose this traitor. Because, besides them, no one else knows Grushko's true face.
    In the most difficult times, Mikhail and Olesya become braver and stronger. Whether in the lost forest or in the dark night with hooting owls and howling wolves, they are always brave, optimistic, and confident. They are also afraid of spending the night in the forest, and they feel uncomfortable when they are hungry, but they have never had despairing thoughts, nor have they cried. In times of crisis, they are not thinking about themselves, but how to let everyone know that Grushko is a traitor, an enemy, and how to prevent the enemy from taking advantage of that roll of secret film. At this time, their beloved dog Anchar becomes their most effective helper, especially for Olesya, who is much bolder with it. However, in order to expose the true face of the traitor Grushko, they have to tell Anchar to send a message. So Mikhail writes a letter on a piece of birch bark, only writing about how Grushko tricked them, stole the secret film, and is a traitor, but not writing about how to save them. From this detailed description, we can see the children's noble political qualities. They know that their parents sacrificed their precious lives to defend the motherland, and they also want to contribute their strength to the motherland, even their own lives. In this fierce struggle, they fully demonstrate their courage and wit. Their love for the motherland is completely integrated with their own lives. Olesya feels scared when she leaves her beloved dog Anchar in such a dangerous situation, but when she faces the enemy face to face, she bravely stands up to protect her younger brother. This bravery comes from her hatred of the enemy. Even a mischievous child like Mikhail imagines that this adventure will make other children envy them, and he is happy about it. This is precisely the naive thinking of children, their true thoughts and feelings. In fact, they are indeed carrying out a glorious mission, helping the public security organs to capture two enemies. They very much hope to encounter adventures in life, and feel that it is an honor to have such an opportunity to test themselves, and do not feel that suffering like this is unjust or unlucky.
    From this film, we can see how imperialism uses internal enemies to undermine the Soviet Union's communist construction. Soboleff, the leader of the geological exploration team, although aware that Grushko is not a good person, did not raise a high degree of vigilance against him. Olya, the kind-hearted draftsman, is vigilant, but she would never have thought that the secret map she drew had been photographed by the enemy's camera. It can be seen that even a small window on the tent not being tightly closed can be exploited by the enemy.
    As an excellent children's film, "Son of a Partisan" is very realistic and vivid in its depiction of children's lives. Mikhail and Olesya, two children with different personalities, leave a very deep impression, making people feel that they are so lovable. Whether in ordinary times or in times of crisis, both children show a serious attitude towards life. This seriousness is very interesting to adults and fully conforms to the unique character of these two Young Pioneers. For example, when Grandpa doesn't let Mikhail go to the Volokhov area, Mikhail blames Olesya for not helping, but Olesya pretends to be serious and says: "Don't you know Grandpa's temper? He's like me, if he says no, it means no." Overall, this film is very successful. It reflects a very important aspect of the social life of Soviet children today and has profound patriotic educational significance. In terms of the treatment of children's film themes and artistic expression, this film is worth learning from by Chinese filmmakers.

    这就是苏联的少年
    ——介绍苏联儿童影片“游击队员之子”

    从最近放映过的几部苏联儿童影片来看，它们所接触的题材更广泛了。它们不仅仅表现了少年儿童在学校和家庭里的生活，而且也突出地表现了少年儿童的社会生活的一面。这种现实生活是少年儿童所熟悉的。通过这种生活描写，这些影片表现了少年儿童的优秀品质和生龙活虎般的性格，使广大的少年儿童从中得到了深刻而又具体的教育。
    苏联儿童影片“游击队员之子”，在这方面有了更显著的进展，它告诉我们，苏联少年儿童今天所想的、所做的，是和祖国的共产主义建设紧紧地联系在一起的。故事里写一个老游击队员雅库布的家庭，他的儿子和儿媳妇在卫国战争中都英勇地牺牲了，留下两个孩子，女孩叫欧列霞，男孩叫米海茜。米海茜是苏沃洛夫陆军学校的幼年生，在暑假里回到家里来了，他和姐姐一道听了老奶奶讲述的一段故事，知道了自己的爸爸妈妈是怎样为保卫祖国而光荣牺牲的。他们听了老爷爷拉着手风琴唱起游击队员所熟悉的歌，想像着当时游击队和敌人艰苦作战的情景，同时也引起了对敌人的深切的仇恨。影片就从这里开始把我们带进了孩子们的天地。
    米海茜和他的姐姐欧列霞，能够成为勇敢坚强的苏维埃少年，是因为爸爸妈妈们的优秀品质教育了他们，他们也真正继承了爸爸妈妈们的英勇爱国的精神，这种现实教育给予孩子们的非凡影响，在苏联是有很多例子的。影片成功地刻划了这两个孩子的英勇形象，米海茜常常很严肃而又有趣地以一个战士的职责来要求自己，他要爷爷带他到危险的瓦洛霍夫地区去。他介绍自己说，他经过锻炼，还很灵巧，他以为这样就会得到爷爷的同意，可是爷爷仍然没有同意。欧列霞也很勇敢活泼，她乐于照顾弟弟，认为自己知道得比米海茜要多，事实上米海茜知道得也并不比她少，例如她把自己小心保藏着的一枝枪给米海茜看，说是能打敌人坦克的手枪，米海茜却一眼就认出了那是信号枪。他们常常为这样的事引起争执，但从这里更显出他们姊弟之间的友爱感情。
    他们知道对敌人要提高警惕，但孩子终究是孩子，他们还不能像成年人那样有丰富的经验来鉴别好人和坏人。特别是对那些隐蔽的敌人，他们更是不容易看出来的。因此，当他们在以前游击队用过的战斗掩蔽部里找到一卷胶片，发现里面有秘密的时候，他们看到格鲁士柯和假摄影记者这两个敌人，却自动把这个秘密告诉他们了，他们万万想不到敌人正因为丢失了这卷胶片在发愁呢。后来叛徒格鲁士柯引诱他们到泥塘里去，米海茜脱去湿透了的裤子，裤袋里明明藏着这卷胶片，他却很信任地把裤子交给了叛徒格鲁士柯。等米海茜和欧列霞发现格鲁士柯是个可恶的坏蛋的时候，他们已陷入危险的境地了。但是孩子们就是这样，一旦认清了是非好坏，他们的态度也表现得非常明确和坚决，他们把格鲁士柯恨得入骨，把他看成比狗还不如，欧列霞相信自己的狗安洽尔在危险之中是不会离开他们的。她对米海茜说：“你不了解安洽尔，他决不能走，他不像格鲁士柯。”米海茜怀着无比的仇恨，用小刀子在树林里的好多棵树上刻着“格鲁士柯是叛徒”这些字，使得叛徒格鲁士柯见了害怕，他费了很大的力气还不能完全消灭这些字迹，结果他竟毒辣地放起火来要烧掉整个树林。从这里可以看出这两个孩子是多么痛恨那个出卖祖国利益的叛徒，他们还很警惕地联想起，出卖游击队的就是这个叛徒格鲁士柯。因此他们觉得自己有责任要把那卷胶片夺回来，有责任要揭露这个叛徒。因为除了他们，现在还没有谁知道格鲁士柯的真面目。
    在最困难的时候，米海茜和欧列霞变得更勇敢更坚强了。不论是在迷失了方向的森林里，不论是在枭啼狼嗥的黑夜，他们始终是勇敢、乐观，有信心的。晚上在森林里过夜，他们也感到害怕，饿着肚子他们也觉得难受，但他们没有作过绝望的想法，也没有哭。他们在危急之中，时时刻刻想到的不是自己，而是如何想办法让大家知道格鲁士柯是叛徒，是敌人，如何不让那卷秘密胶片被敌人拿去利用。这时候，他们那只心爱的狗安洽尔，做了他们最得力的帮手，特别是欧列霞，有它在一起，胆子也大多了。可是，他们为了要揭穿叛徒格鲁士柯的真面目，不得不叫安洽尔去报信。于是米海茜在一张桦树皮上写信，信里只写到格鲁士柯如何骗了他们，偷走了秘密胶片，是个叛徒，却没有写到如何救救他们。就从这个细节的描写上，我们可以看出孩子们的高贵的政治品质，他们知道，自己的爸爸妈妈为了保卫祖国，献出了宝贵的生命，他们也要为祖国贡献出他们的力量，甚至他们自己的生命。在这场激烈的斗争中，他们充分表现出了他们的勇敢和机智，他们对祖国的热爱，是和自己的生命完全融和在一起的。欧列霞在这样危险的时候，离开了心爱的狗安洽尔而感到害怕，可是，当面对面地碰到敌人的时候，她却毫不胆怯地起来保护她的弟弟了。这种勇敢是发自对敌人的憎恨的。像米海茜这样淘气的孩子，甚至还想像着这场冒险会使别的孩子羡慕他们，他反而觉得高兴，这正是孩子们的天真的想法，是他们的真实的思想感情。事实上他们的确执行着一个光荣的任务，帮助公安机关抓住两个敌人。他们非常希望在生活中碰到冒险的事，认为碰到这样的机会来考验自己是光荣的，并不觉得这样受苦是冤枉的、倒霉的。
    从这部影片里，我们可以看出帝国主义是怎样利用内部的敌人来破坏苏联的共产主义建设，地质勘察队的领队人索保列夫，虽已意识到格鲁士柯不是个好人，但对他没有引起高度的警惕。那个好心肠的绘图员欧丽，是有警惕性的，可是她怎么也不会想到，就是她绘制的那张秘密地图，已经被摄进敌人的照相机里了，可见得做保密工作连一点疏忽都不行，即使帐篷上一个小小的窗口没有关严，也会给敌人钻空子的。
    作为一部出色的儿童影片，“游击队员之子”对少年儿童生活的描写是很真实很生动的，米海茜和欧列霞，两个性格不同的孩子，给人留下了极深刻的印象，令人觉得他们是那么可爱。不论在平时，或者在危急的时候，两个孩子都表现了对生活的严肃态度，这种严肃在成年人看来是很有趣的，完全符合这两个少先队员的独特性格。比如，爷爷不让米海茜到瓦洛霍夫地区去，米海茜责怪欧列霞为什么不帮忙，欧列霞却装得很正经地说：“你还不知道爷爷的脾气吗，和我一样，说不行，就是不行。”总的说来，这部影片是很成功的，他反映出今天苏联少年儿童社会生活的极重要的一面，是具有深刻的爱国主义教育意义的。在儿童电影的题材处理和艺术表现方面，这部影片都值得我国电影工作者学习。
