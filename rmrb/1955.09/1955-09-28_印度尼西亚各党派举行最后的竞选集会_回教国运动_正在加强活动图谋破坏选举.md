Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 26th: According to TASS, in many cities throughout Indonesia on September 24th, various parties held their final election rallies. According to a decision by the Indonesian government, all forms of election propaganda will cease from the 25th, and gatherings and assemblies will be prohibited. In Jakarta and other cities, military patrols have been deployed in the streets and squares. According to an order from Acting Army Chief of Staff Colonel Lubis, the army has entered combat readiness.

President Sukarno was originally scheduled to deliver a speech at a mass rally in Bandung on the 25th, but this rally was prohibited by the commander of West Java. The Nationalist Party's newspaper, "Sunday News," reported, "The Harahap Cabinet has forbidden the President from delivering a speech at the Bandung rally."

The Indonesian Communist Party held a mass rally in the Jakarta area on the 24th. The General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, D.N. Aidit, spoke at the rally. He pointed out the main tasks of the Indonesian people in the struggle for complete national independence, for the general improvement of people's welfare, and for the establishment of solid national unity. Aidit sharply criticized the actions of the leaders of the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party. He emphasized that the leaders of these parties were trying to divide the unity of the people. Aidit also emphasized the importance of unity among Islamic parties, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other organizations, and called on everyone to vote for the Indonesian Communist Party.

Representatives from the Indonesian Central Trade Union and other social organizations also spoke at the rally.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 27th: Indonesian newspapers report that the "Islamic State Movement" bandit gangs are intensifying their activities, attempting to disrupt the Indonesian general election to be held on September 29th.

In Sulawesi, government troops have engaged in combat with the bandits. In Jakarta, bandits recently infiltrated the city, attempting to create disturbances during the general election.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 26th, pointing out the possibility of foreign interference in the Indonesian general election. The newspaper pointed out that the "Islamic State Movement" has close ties with imperialists, as revealed during the trial of the Dutch subversive Rongslag. The newspaper also stated that there are elements in Indonesia who support foreign interference, and they are attempting to drag Indonesia into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
