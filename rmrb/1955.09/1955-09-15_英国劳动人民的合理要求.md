Recently, the economic situation in Britain has further deteriorated. On the one hand, Britain's foreign trade deficit continues to widen, resulting in a continuous reduction of its gold and dollar reserves. According to official figures, Britain's gold and dollar reserves fell by $136 million in July and $87 million in August. On the other hand, rapidly rising prices have severely threatened the lives of the vast majority of people, especially the working people. According to statistics from the British magazine "The Economist," retail prices rose by nearly 3 percent in just over half a month from July 12 to August 2.

In the face of these facts, the British government and monopoly capitalists are unwilling to face the real reasons for the deterioration of the British economy and attempt to get rid of the difficulties encountered by the British economy by restricting wages, that is, by further reducing the living standards of the working people. To this end, the British government and some bourgeois newspapers serving the interests of monopoly capital insist that Britain's labor costs are affecting the British economy. An August 15th communique issued by the British Treasury stated: "The sharply rising labor costs seriously threaten Britain's competitive strength in the world market." They also pinned their hopes for achieving wage restrictions on the leadership of the British Trades Union Congress.

The 87th Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress, held in Southport from September 5th to 9th, saw a fierce struggle over the issue of wages. On the eve of the conference, more than six million working people had already made demands for wage increases. Electrical Trades Union Secretary Hazzell also proposed a motion condemning all forms of restrictions on wage increase demands at the meeting, which was supported by other trade union organizations including the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the National Union of Mineworkers. This situation reflects the will of the British working class to resolutely struggle to safeguard their right to live. However, as in the past, the leadership of the British Trades Union Congress is not safeguarding the vital interests of the working class; on the contrary, it is doing its best to defend the interests of monopoly capital and big business owners. In his speech, Geddes, Chairman of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, actually proposed a so-called "wage war" truce, aimed at the laboring people's demands for higher wages. Another leader of the Trades Union Congress, Haywood, Chairman of the Economic Committee, also followed the tone of the British government and monopoly capitalists, requesting trade unions to exercise "self-restraint" in wage demands. The General Council of the Trades Union Congress also suggested in its summary report that the constitution of the Trades Union Congress be amended so that the General Council would have the power to intervene when negotiations between workers and business owners threatened to lead to strikes. This suggestion of the General Council, aimed at abolishing the workers' right to strike, was clearly intended to achieve the goal of restricting wages by this means. Therefore, this proposal was strongly opposed at the meeting. Nevertheless, the proposal was passed under the manipulation of the General Council and a group formed by the right-wing leaders of some large trade unions, although as many as 3,039,000 votes were cast against it. Similarly, under the manipulation of the aforementioned leadership forces, the Trades Union Congress rejected the Electrical Trades Union's proposal to condemn wage restrictions.

As pointed out by some observers who attended the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress and some bourgeois newspapers, the above-mentioned unreasonable decisions forced by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress are very unrealistic.

The reality of the British economy shows that the so-called rise in British labor costs is complete nonsense. The fact is that even according to official British data, the real wages of British workers in the past six years have been lower than the level of 1947. The following figures are illustrative. In the first ten months of 1954, British workers' wages nominally increased by 4 percent, but at the same time, prices also rose by 4 percent, of which the price of food, which is of decisive significance to the lives of the working class, rose by 8 percent in that year. It can be seen from this that the real wages of British workers not only did not increase in that year, but in fact decreased. Since the beginning of this year, the rate of price increases has been even more rapid. At the end of July, coal prices rose by 18 percent, the largest price increase in the post-war period. All other items related to the lives of the working people, such as food, clothing, fuel, furniture, beverages, and rent, have also increased in price. The British National Association of Master Bakers and Confectioners announced in mid-August that the prices of bread, cakes, and other pastries would rise by 10 to 15 percent. In this case, the situation in which the actual income of British workers has been greatly reduced is completely conceivable.

On the one hand, there is a decrease in the actual income of workers, and on the other hand, due to the continuous increase in the labor intensity of workers by capitalists, the labor productivity of workers has increased. For example, from 1948 to 1954, labor productivity in manufacturing increased by a total of 19.5 percent. However, workers did not benefit from this in any way, and the increased share of income fell into the pockets of business owners. Therefore, the profits of British monopoly capital have continued to grow year after year, reaching unprecedented levels. The total profit of British enterprises in 1952 was 2.919 billion pounds, and in 1953 it increased to 3.13 billion pounds. In 1954, the total profit increased by another 11 percent. According to materials published in the British "Labor Research Department" bulletin on the situation in the first seven months of this year, the profits of 2,322 companies increased by another 12.8 percent. It can be seen from this that what is rising sharply is not labor costs, but the profits of monopoly capitalists. Therefore, the British laboring people have every reason to believe that what should be restricted is the increasing profits of British monopoly capital, not their own wages. It should also be pointed out that as long as such profits can be reduced, workers' wages can be substantially increased without affecting Britain's external competitiveness.

The British working people not only suffer from rising prices and intensified capital exploitation, but also bear an increasingly heavy tax burden. British official figures show that the total amount of British taxes was 3.729 billion pounds in the 1950-1951 fiscal year, and increased to 4.242 billion pounds in the 1954-1955 fiscal year. According to the provisions of the 1955-1956 budget, taxes will increase by another 128 million pounds compared with the previous fiscal year. Of course, the vast majority of the increased tax amount will fall on the heads of the working people. This cannot but make the lives of the working people even more difficult.

The deterioration of living conditions has forced the British laboring people to rise up and wage a resolute struggle to defend their economic rights. Since the war, the British strike movement has been rising year by year, and the number of strikes in the first half of this year has reached the highest record in the past ten years since the war. This situation shows that the struggle of the British laboring people to demand higher wages is unstoppable.

It is very clear that using the method of restricting wages to further reduce the living standards of the working people and further intensify the exploitation of them can only make the class contradictions within Britain more acute and will not help to improve the economic situation in Britain. Because the fundamental reason for the deteriorating British economy is the British government's policy of arms expansion and the embargo policy that is subordinate to the purpose of the "Cold War." Britain's military spending increases every year, and this year it accounts for more than one-third of the total budget expenditure; Britain's military production accounts for 17 percent of the total industrial output. Huge military expenditures have caused the intensification of inflation; the increasingly expanding military production has absorbed a large amount of raw materials, but exports cannot be increased accordingly, so the trade deficit is increasing day by day. In this situation, Britain is also being squeezed and fiercely competed with by the United States, West Germany, Japan and other capitalist countries in the capitalist world market, but on the other hand, the embargo policy has also tied its own hands, unable to expand trade with the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp, which is also a fatal blow to the British economy, which relies on foreign trade. If the above situation is not changed, the deterioration of the British economy will obviously only continue to deepen.

The broad masses of the British people, first and foremost the British working people, have for years been demanding an end to the arms race, advocating the easing of international tensions and the expansion of East-West trade. Since the end of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, this call has become even louder. Many bourgeois newspapers have also recently advocated reducing military spending. The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" pointed out in its editorial that savings in defense spending would help to get rid of Britain's economic difficulties. There is no doubt that the wishes of the broad masses of the people and public opinion are correct.

    英国劳动人民的合理要求
    高集
    最近以来，英国的经济情况已进一步恶化。一方面英国对外贸易的逆差继续增大，从而使它的黄金美元储备不断减少。根据官方公布的数字，英国黄金美元的储备七月份减少了一亿三千六百万美元，八月份又减少了八千七百万美元。另一方面，物价迅速上涨，使广大人民的生活，特别是劳动人民的生活受到了极大的威胁。据英国“经济学家”杂志的统计，仅从七月十二日至八月二日的半个多月中，零售物价就上涨了将近百分之三。
    在这种事实的面前，英国政府和垄断资本家们不肯正视造成英国经济恶化的真正原因，而企图以限制工资，也就是要以进一步压低劳动人民生活水平的办法，来摆脱英国经济所遭遇到的困难。为了这样，英国政府和一些为垄断资本利益服务的资产阶级报刊，硬说英国的劳工成本影响着英国的经济。英国财政部八月十五日发表的公报就说：“猛烈上涨的劳工成本严重地威胁着英国在世界市场上的竞争力量。”它们并且把实现限制工资的希望寄托在英国职工大会的领导集团的身上。
    由九月五日至九日在南港举行的英国职工大会第八十七届年会，在工资问题上展开了激烈的斗争。在大会开始的前夕，已经有六百多万劳动人民提出了增加工资的要求。电气工会书记赫泽尔并在会议上提出谴责用一切形式限制增加工资要求的提案，这个提案得到了包括混合机械工业工会以及全国矿工联盟等其他工会组织的支持。这种情形反映了英国工人阶级为保障自己的生活权利而坚决斗争的意志。但是，正如以往的情形一样，英国职工大会的领导集团所维护的不是工人阶级的切身利益，相反的却极力为垄断资本和大企业主的利益辩护。职工大会最高委员会主席吉迪斯在他的发言中，竟然针对着劳动人民提高工资的要求，而提出了所谓“工资战”停战的主张；职工大会的另一个首脑、经济委员会主席海伍德也追随着英国政府和垄断资本家的口吻，要求工会在工资要求方面“自制”。职工大会最高委员会并且在总结报告中建议修改职工大会章程，以便最高委员会在工人和企业主谈判势将酿成罢工时，能够有权进行干预。最高委员会这个目的在于取消工人罢工权利的建议，显然是为了要用这种手段来达到限制工资的企图。因此，这个建议在会议上遭到了强烈的反对。尽管如此，这个建议还是在最高委员会和一些大工会右翼领导者结成的集团的操纵下通过了，虽然反对的有三百零三万九千票之多。同样的，也是在上述领导势力的操纵下，职工大会否决了电气工会关于谴责限制工资的提案。
    正如一些参加职工大会年会的观察家以及一些资产阶级报纸所指出的，职工大会最高委员会强迫大会所作出的上述的不合理的决定，是非常不现实的。
    英国经济的现实情况说明，所谓英国劳工成本上涨的说法完全是一派胡说。事实是即使根据英国官方的资料也表明，在过去六年中，英国工人的实际工资低于一九四七年的水平。下面的数字是具有说明性的。在一九五四年头十个月内，英国工人的工资在名义上是增加了百分之四，但是就在同时，物价也上涨了百分之四，其中对工人阶级的生活具有决定意义的食品价格在这一年内上涨了百分之八。由此可见，英国工人的实际工资在这一年内不但没有增加，实质上反而是下降了。今年以来，物价上涨的速度更为猛烈。在七月底，煤价上涨了百分之十八，这是战后时期最大的一次涨价。同劳动人民生活有关的一切其他物品，如粮食、衣服、燃料、家具、饮料和房租也莫不涨价。英国全国面包点心店主协会在八月中就曾宣布，面包、蛋糕和其他点心的价格将上涨百分之十到十五。在这种情况下，英国工人实际收入大大降低的情形是完全可以想见的。
    一方面是工人的实际收入的降低，另一方面由于资本家不断增加工人的劳动强度，工人的劳动生产率是提高了。例如，从一九四八年到一九五四年，制造业中劳动生产率一共提高了百分之十九点五。但是工人并没有从此中得到任何好处，增加的份额的收入都落到企业主的荷包里了。因此，英国垄断资本的利润累年不断增长，而达到了空前的水平。一九五二年英国企业的利润总额达二十九亿一千九百万英镑，一九五三年增加到三十一亿三千万英镑。一九五四年利润总额又增加了百分之十一。今年头七个月的情况，根据英国“劳动研究部”公报刊载的材料，二千三百二十二家公司的利润又增加了百分之十二点八。由此可见，猛烈上涨的不是劳工成本，而是垄断资本家的利润。因此，英国劳动人民完全有理由认为应该加以限制的是英国垄断资本日益增长的利润，而不是他们自己的工资。并且应当指出，只要能够减少这种利润就可以在毫不影响英国对外竞争能力的情况下使工人的工资有实际的增加。
    英国劳动人民不仅遭受着物价上涨和资本剥削加强的痛苦，并且还承受着日益沉重的捐税负担。英国官方数字表明，英国赋税总额在一九五○—一九五一年度是三十七亿二千九百万英镑，到一九五四—一九五五年度增加到了四十二亿四千二百万英镑。根据一九五五—一九五六年度的预算的规定，赋税要比上一年度再增加一亿二千八百万英镑。当然绝大部分增加的税额是要落到劳动人民的头上的。这就不能不使得劳动人民的生活更加陷于困苦。
    生活条件的恶化使英国的劳动人民不能不起来为保卫自己的经济权利，而进行坚决的斗争。战后以来，英国的罢工运动一年比一年高涨，今年上半年罢工的次数更达到战后十年来的最高纪录。这种情形说明，英国劳动人民要求提高工资的斗争是不可遏止的。
    事情很清楚：要以限制工资的办法来进一步压低劳动人民生活水平和进一步加强对他们的剥削，这只能使英国国内的阶级矛盾更加尖锐化，而对改善英国的经济情况是毫无帮助的。因为，使英国经济日益恶化的根本原因是英国政府奉行的军备扩张政策和服从于“冷战”目的的禁运政策。英国的军事开支每年都有增加，今年更达全部预算支出的三分之一以上；英国的军事生产已占全部工业产量的百分之十七。庞大的军费开支造成了通货膨胀的加剧；日益扩充的军事生产吸收了大量的原料，出口却无法相应地增加，因而贸易逆差日益增大。在这种情形下，英国在资本主义世界市场上又遭受到美国、西德、日本和其他资本主义国家的排挤和激烈竞争，但是另一方面，禁运政策又使英国束缚起自己的手脚，不能扩大同和平民主阵营国家的贸易，这对于依靠对外贸易的英国经济来说也是一个致命的伤害。上述的这种情况如果不加以改变，英国经济的恶化显然只会继续加深下去。
    广大的英国人民，首先是英国劳动人民几年来一直要求停止军备竞赛，主张缓和国际紧张局势和扩大东西方贸易，这种呼声自日内瓦四国政府首脑会议结束以来是更为响亮了。许多资产阶级报纸最近也纷纷主张缩减军事开支。“每日电讯与晨邮报”在社论中就指出，国防开支的节省，将有助于摆脱英国的经济困境。毫无疑问，广大人民和公众舆论的这种愿望是正确的。
