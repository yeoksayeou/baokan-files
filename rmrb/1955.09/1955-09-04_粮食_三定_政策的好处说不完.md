The Benefits of the Grain "Three Fixes" Policy are Endless
贾 Kunshan

I am Jia Kunshan, a member of the Xinyang Agricultural Cooperative in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi. I am sixty-two years old this year, and I have never had a precise plan for eating and using grain. To be honest, when our People's Government first implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, I was not used to it. The staff explained the benefits again and again, but I was always skeptical. After two years of facts proving it, it is truly "hindsight is 20/20 vision," and all the benefits have been seen.

We are a cotton-producing area. From the beginning of the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, I have been worried that our area has always had to buy grain from other places. Now that the unified purchase and sale of grain is implemented, would things become impossible? Now, I can put my mind at ease. Later, I heard from the staff of my township that the state can only purchase about 160,000 jin of grain from us a year, but the state sells more than 300,000 jin. I often think: if the unified purchase and sale of grain had not been implemented, wouldn't the knife handle have to be grasped by the grain merchants? I remember that before the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the government's listed price was 1.1 or 1.2 jiao per jin of wheat, but private merchants took advantage of the fact that the state did not have much grain in its hands and the supply was insufficient, and they had to sell it for more than 2 jiao per jin. If we calculate according to the state's failure to implement the unified purchase and sale of grain, our township alone would have to spend more than 24,000 yuan more on grain purchases a year, which is equivalent to letting eighty big cattle be led away for nothing. It's true that words are afraid of detailed explanations, and accounts are afraid of detailed calculations!

If it is said that the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain is a new thing in the eyes of me, a person in my sixties, then the stability of grain and commodity prices is also a new thing. From the time I can remember, it would be strange if the price of grain did not rise and fall several times in a year! More than twenty years ago, I worked for a landlord in Xiqiu Yang Village. It was originally agreed that the annual price (wages) was sixty yuan, equivalent to six shi of wheat. This kind of price was considered the highest in the surrounding area. But before the year's work was finished, sixty yuan was only worth a little more than one shi of wheat. Since liberation, everything has been stable, but I still thought that maybe I wouldn't be able to keep it up if I encountered a major disaster. Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, this idea has also been wrong. Especially in the first few months of this year, there was no rain, and people were panicked, but the state's listed price for the supply of grain was still stable, and how much should be supplied was supplied, and how much money it was was still how much money it was. It's true that you can't look at everything with old eyes. Last year, some areas of our country suffered from the worst floods in a century, and the state still supplied grain to the people in the disaster areas at reasonable prices, which made me even more convinced of the correctness of the state's implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain.

To be honest, there were still vague areas in the unified purchase and sale of grain in the past. How much should the state purchase each year? How much should be sold? How much should each household sell? How much can be kept? How much should each household buy? In the past, no one knew. People's hearts are always like a knot, and they can't figure out the bottom line. I often hear people say unsatisfactory things. Unexpectedly, Chairman Mao and the People's Government thought so carefully, and only two years after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, they formulated this good method of implementing the "Three Fixes" for grain. When this method was announced this spring, and various indicators were announced, everyone said it was right! The individual farmer Li Rongyi never wanted to join the cooperative no matter who asked him to. I talked to him several times, but I didn't understand his thoughts. Unexpectedly, the "Three Fixes" for grain touched his heart. It turned out that he was afraid that after joining the cooperative, the public would figure out his bottom line, and that the more he increased production, the more he would have to purchase. Once the "Three Fixes" policy for grain was announced, his heart was settled. He has already stated that whenever the agricultural cooperative is expanded, he will sign up to participate. This is really the key to happiness. (Recorded by Zhang Yingxuan)

    粮食“三定”政策的好处说不完
    贾崑山
    我是陕西三原县新阳农业合作社的社员，今年已是六十二岁的人了，从来吃粮用粮都没有精密计划。咱们人民政府才开始实行粮食统购统销的时候，不用说，我是看不惯的。工作人员讲了老半天这好处，那好处，我总是半信半疑的。经过这两年来的事实证明，真个是“过后见人心”，好处全看到了。
    我们这里是产棉区。从开始实行粮食统购统销时起，我就一直在耽心，像我们这里一向要买外地粮食，如今一实行粮食统购统销，是不是会把世事治死了。这阵子，我就算有一百条心也放下了。以后听我乡工作人员说，国家从我们这里一年约摸只能购到十六万多斤粮，可是国家销出来的就要有三十多万斤。我常想：要是没有实行粮食统购统销，刀把子还不是要捉到粮商手里吗？我记得没有实行粮食统购统销以前，政府的牌价是一角一、二分一斤麦子，可是私商趁国家粮食掌握不多，供应不充分的空子，就非要卖两角多一斤不可。要按国家不实行粮食统购统销来划算，光我们一个乡一年所买的粮食就要多花出两万四千多元，等于八十头大牛叫人白白牵跑了。真是话怕细讲，账怕细算！
    要是说实行粮食统购统销在我这六十多岁的人看来是新事，说到粮价、物价会稳定也是新事。从我记得事起，要是那一年粮食价钱没有几起几落那才是怪事哩！二十多年前，我在西秋阳村给地主做活，原先讲定一年身价（工钱）是六十块钱，合六石麦子，这种身价在方圆附近要算顶高的了。可是没到把一年的活做完，六十块钱只顶一石多麦使换了。从解放后，一切都算稳下来了，但我还想，也许碰上个大小灾荒就保不住了。自从实行粮食统购统销以来，这个想法也不对头了。特别是今年春上几个月没落雨，人心惶惶的，但是国家供应粮食的牌价仍然是稳风不动，该供应多少就供应多少，该多少钱，还是多少钱。真是啥事情都不能用老眼光来看了。去年咱们国家有些地方遭到百年未有的大水灾，国家依然以合理价格供应给灾区人民粮食，越发使我信服国家实行粮食统购统销的正确了。
    说实话，粮食统购统销，过去也还有含糊的地方，每年国家要购多少？销多少？那家应卖多少？能留多少？那家应买多少？在过去是谁也不清楚的。人心里总像结个疙瘩一样，摸不着底，我也常听有人说不满的话。真想不到，毛主席和人民政府想的这么周到，实行粮食统购统销才二年光景，又制定了实行粮食“三定”这个好办法。今年春上一公布这个办法，宣布了各项指标，大家都说对着哩！单干农民李荣义，原先谁叫他入社他都不入，我和他谈过几回，都没摸来他的心事。想不到，粮食“三定”把他的心底摸着了。原来他是怕入了社，公家把他的底子摸清了，怕增产多购得也多。粮食“三定”政策一公布，算是把他的心也定下来了。他已经表示，啥时扩大农业社，啥时要报名参加。这真是开心的钥匙。（张应选记）
