	How We Strive for High Yields of Corn
	Wang Baojing

	I am the director of the Xinzhuang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bailinggong, Liquan County, Shaanxi Province. Our village has had bumper harvests every year since 1951. Speaking only of corn, the highest yield per mu in the past was no more than three or four hundred jin. In 1952, our mutual aid group harvested 859 jin per mu from 1.7 mu of high-yield corn. In 1953, the 8.86 mu of high-yield corn averaged 886 jin per mu, with 1.26 mu of high-yield land yielding 1316 jin and 11 liang per mu. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative in 1954, 51.77 mu of corn averaged 566 jin and 14 liang per mu, with 1.09 mu of high-yield land yielding 1500 jin and 13 liang per mu. Why were we able to achieve such bumper harvests? It was because we resolutely followed the path of agricultural collectivization indicated by the Communist Party and improved our farming techniques. Of course, we encountered many difficulties on the road to agricultural collectivization; but these difficulties were overcome one by one.

	The First Difficulty

	In 1951, when the mutual aid group was first established, we didn't understand that this was the first step towards agricultural collectivization, so we couldn't work conscientiously or connect with the masses. The masses said we were running a "reckless group." Later, the Communist Party District Committee Secretary told me: We are establishing mutual aid groups to lead farmers down the path of agricultural collectivization; now you are only concerned with working on your own, without connecting with the masses, which is like a locomotive running forward without any carriages, it's useless! The County Head told me: To run a mutual aid group well, we must increase the yield per unit area. The words of the District Committee Secretary and the County Head pointed out the direction of uniting the masses and following the path of agricultural collectivization. My heart lit up, and I was even more motivated.

	In the spring of the following year, the Zhang Mingliang mutual aid group challenged the farmers in the Northwest, saying that they would harvest 1020 jin of corn per mu; When the county held a meeting of mutual aid group leaders, I discussed it with the leadership and thought we had the conditions to take up the challenge. So I said at the meeting: They are aiming for 1020, we will aim for 1200! Many elderly farmers had never harvested so much grain, and they mocked, "That's crazy; nonsense!" Before I even returned, the word spread in the village. Some farmers didn't believe it, some farmers said, "The government praised him, look how arrogant he has become!" Some backward farmers said, "If he doesn't harvest that much in the future, the government will arrest him! At least he will have to compensate for the shortfall." When my father heard this, he was frightened and scolded me all day long, telling me to wind up the mutual aid group as soon as possible. He said to me: "If you keep messing around like this, you'll drive your wife away, and we'll each mind our own business." My mother and my wife didn't give me good face either. Once, I was late returning from a meeting of the Communist Youth League branch, and my father cursed in the house, forbidding anyone to open the door. After waiting for almost an hour, my wife finally came to open the door. As soon as she opened the door, she went into the house without saying a word. I felt extremely uncomfortable, tossing and turning in bed, thinking: Starting a mutual aid group, striving for high yields, expending so much effort, and no one wants to see it, it's better to give up! But then I thought: No! Huang Jiguang could sacrifice his life to defend the motherland and defend peace. What is it to encounter such difficulties! The County Head had said long ago that there would be many difficulties in carrying out mutual aid and cooperation. How can we be frightened by difficulties! Besides, my suffering a little is a small matter. If the mutual aid group collapses and the high yield cannot be achieved, the cause of agricultural collectivization will suffer losses, which would be terrible. So I made up my mind: I must achieve results and convince the masses and my family with the facts of increased production.

	Changing the Old Practices

	Soon, the government sent Comrade Yang Jianwu from the technical guidance station to help us strive for high yields. As soon as he arrived, he told me: To achieve high yields, we must use scientific farming techniques, such as seed selection, close planting, staggered fertilization, detasseling and hybridization, and so on. At first, he explained, and I listened, but later we started to argue. To be honest, he taught me a lot of knowledge. I used to farm, but what kind of farming was that! According to the old procedures for planting corn, first of all, there was no seed selection. When it was time to plant, some seeds were casually planted. Secondly, not much manure was applied, and there was no attention to staggered fertilization. As soon as the summer harvest was over, the land was plowed and planted. Weeds were hoed when there were too many weeds, and water was watered when it was dry.

	To set an example first, we selected a few mu of land from the family of group member Zheng Fucai as high-yield land; But Zheng Fucai firmly opposed it; Later, thanks to the help of poor peasant group member Yao Shengzhi, he agreed. This year, we planted locally sourced yellow corn that had been selected grain by grain, and left 3,480 seedlings per mu, which was more than a thousand more than most people. Some people thought it was not good to leave it so dense, their reason was: "The land is like a person, a person can only take 100 jin, you insist on him taking 200 jin, how can he take it?" It seemed very reasonable. But I knew that the previous method of leaving seedlings was too sparse; By implementing reasonable close planting and increasing fertilizer, crops could grow well. So we applied seven carts of manure, as well as some oil dregs and chemical fertilizers. At that time, because we didn't understand many principles in crop rows, we only cared about pouring manure in the middle of the field. This method would crush the corn and burn it to death. Old man Wang Jinshou saw it and quickly taught us to pour the manure on the edge of the field first, and then sprinkle it into the field little by little. After fertilizing, we watered.

	Most people water by flooding, which wastes water and damages the roots of crops. Therefore, we used furrow irrigation and frequent shallow watering. This was another new method, and some people were talking nonsense, especially when I walked in front, and people were pointing at my back and talking, which made me feel very uncomfortable. Yang Jianwu saw that I was in a bad mood and quickly said to me: "There will always be difficulties in any work, we must withstand the test and not be afraid of difficulties."

	Later, when the corn came out with smallpox and tasseled, we did detasseling and artificial pollination. At that time, some people said: "This is really being completely crazy. The crops are growing well, but you cut off their heads. Cut off your head and see if you can live!" I ignored these words because I knew that the people who said these words had lived in the old society for too long, and their old ideas could not be changed for a while; As long as the facts are presented to them, they will understand.

	Just then, it suddenly started to rain continuously, and the corn was attacked by stem borers. This made me very anxious. I ran to the high-yield field several times a day, and soon I fell ill from exhaustion. Yang Jianwu wouldn't let me go to the field again; But how could I rest assured? If the artificial pollination work was not done well, the corn would be damaged by the rain, eaten by insects, and the yield would be reduced, which would have a very bad impact! If the first attempt at high yield failed, would the masses still believe it in the future? At this time, I was a little shaken and wanted to quit to avoid looking even worse in the future. Coincidentally, the County Head heard that I was sick and came to see me. He said a lot to me, which I still remember firmly. He said: How many revolutionary martyrs shed blood and sacrificed themselves and struggled arduously to achieve today's victory; We should learn their revolutionary spirit to build socialism! As soon as I heard this, I thought, yes, how can there be no difficulties in building socialism, how can we give up halfway! I regained my courage. Later, with the specific help of Yang Jianwu and the joint efforts of the group members, we completed the pollination work and extinguished the pest damage well.

	Despite the rain and pest damage, the corn still had a bumper harvest this year, averaging 859 jin per mu. Facts are more powerful than anything. When the masses saw that the mutual aid group was indeed good and had truly achieved increased production, the farmers in the whole village joined the mutual aid group one after another.

	The Power is Growing

	Then, we carried out large-scale high-yield production and converted 8.6 mu of corn land into wheat, planning to harvest 400 jin per mu. At this time, the group members were more united than before, and the power was even greater. All 42 mu of wheat in the group averaged 349 jin per mu, of which the 8.6 mu of high-yield land yielded 555.5 jin per mu, and 1.7 mu of land averaged 690 jin per mu, exceeding the high-yield plan. In 1954, our group's 127 mu of wheat averaged 309 jin per mu, of which 1.09 mu of high-yield land yielded 829 jin and 15 liang per mu.

	The fact of continuous increase in production has had a great impact on the masses, and last spring our mutual aid group was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. The power of the agricultural production cooperative is even greater than that of the mutual aid group, and we have even better conditions for large-scale high-yield production! This year we planted 51.77 mu of corn, including 18.87 mu of red heart white horse tooth corn. We selected the seeds of the red heart white horse tooth corn grain by grain, which would be impossible for self-employed farmers, and difficult for mutual aid groups. Our cooperative harvested wheat on June 1st, applied basal fertilizer on the 2nd, and then plowed it once with a five-inch step plow, left the stubble to dry in the sun for seven or eight days, and then irrigated it with small water. After doing this, we sowed the seeds and used ammonium sulfate as the base fertilizer. The advantage of this method is that it can weather the soil, accumulate a large amount of irrigation water, promote seed germination, accelerate the rotting of wheat stubble, and prevent seedlings from suffering drought during the hot season. But, despite so many benefits, individual households and mutual aid groups have few people, and if they take care of harvesting wheat, they cannot take care of turning the soil and irrigating. With more people, more fertilizer can be accumulated. Wang Gaiguo's mother in the west of the village had several old walls (the soil of the old walls can be used as fertilizer). She wanted to tear down the old walls and build new ones, but she didn't have the strength; Mutual aid groups have few people and can't do it either. We immediately mobilized the cooperative members, tearing down the walls, hauling manure to the land, and building new walls for her at the same time. When the manure was applied, the new walls were also built, which not only increased fertilizer for our cooperative, but also helped Gaiguo's mother overcome her difficulties. Later, we treated insects four times, prevented wind twice, did detasseling and artificial pollination, and removed female ears and conjoined small ears that could not be pollinated. This year our corn grew extremely well. When the county and district organized the masses to visit, everyone took a look, ha! The stalks were twelve or three feet high, and many plants had two big corncobs, and some even had three or four. How could this not be a bumper harvest!

	Overcoming the Storm

	But one day in the middle of the night, there was a hurricane and a rainstorm. The water in the canal was flowing loudly, and the flood would damage the crops. And those few days, middle peasant cooperative member Ma Shuxiu was clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative. The cooperative held meetings for several nights in a row to study how to deal with this problem; When I came back at night, I fell asleep like I was dead, and I had no strength at all. Suddenly, production team leader Wang Baoli came to call me and asked me to lead everyone to check the water. As soon as I heard him call, I was a little unhappy. It was so hard to find a free time to sleep! But I suddenly remembered the Party Branch Secretary in the movie "Spring Breeze Blows to Nuomin River". Wasn't he also working outside in the rain in the middle of the night to consolidate the agricultural production cooperative? I quickly got up and ran to the field with Wang Baoli and others. We tried hard to dig a gap in the canal to let the water flow into the dry land; This is how we protected the crops.

	When I returned home from the field, I was preparing to take my furniture and join the masses to salvage the firewood washed down by the river. My father looked at the weather and said to me: "With such a big storm, the corn might fall!" I was panicked when I heard this, thinking: That 1.09 mu of high-yield corn, with tall stalks and heavy cobs, would be more easily blown down by the wind; If it really fell, the corn yield would be reduced, which would have a very bad impact on the masses; Especially since Ma Shuxiu was watching to see if the agricultural production cooperative could really produce a bumper harvest; At the same time, he planted one mu of corn in his private plot to compete with the cooperative. We must not lose to Ma Shuxiu. I also thought: Although going to the river to salvage firewood once could recover some firewood to burn; But after all, this is only a small personal interest. I am a Communist Party member, how can I only care about personal interests and not collective interests, only care about immediate interests and not long-term interests! I decided to use ropes to tie up the corn and protect it.

	Because of good farming and a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters, the cooperative's 50-plus mu of corn averaged 566 jin and 14 liang per mu in the autumn, of which the 18-plus mu of red heart white horse tooth corn yielded 785 jin per mu, and the 1.09 mu of high-yield land yielded 1500 jin and 13 liang per mu. And the corn on the one mu of high-yield land that Ma Shuxiu planted himself only yielded 400 jin. Ma Shuxiu admitted that he had lost to the agricultural production cooperative; And because the cooperative had a bumper harvest, his income also increased, so he not only no longer demanded to withdraw from the cooperative, but also became an activist. When the cooperative expanded last winter, Ma Shuxiu led a group discussion, using his own ideological transformation process to educate other middle peasants who had concerns. Everyone in the village saw the benefits of the agricultural production cooperative with their own eyes, and 65 out of 67 households signed up to join the cooperative. This is really: Mutual aid and cooperation guarantee increased production, and increased production promotes mutual aid and cooperation!

	Moving Forward with Everyone

	I said at the beginning that the bumper harvest depends entirely on the leadership of the Communist Party, and now I want to add a sentence, it is also because the power of the masses has been brought into play.

	When we first started striving for high yields, some farmers not only did not believe it, but even ridiculed us. This was mainly because they had not experienced such things. Later, the situation was different, and everyone came up with ideas and solutions. Take my family as an example! In the past, my father didn't believe in mutual aid, cooperation, and high yields. He not only didn't help with my work, but also attacked it. I shouted "Selling vinegar" in the front, and he said "Not sour" in the back. Now it's different. He actively publicizes the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives to the masses, and uses the facts of high yields to persuade everyone to believe in new technologies. I go to meetings in the province and county. Before I leave, he always tells me repeatedly to attend the meetings carefully, learn skills, and not to disappoint the expectations of the Communist Party, the government, and the masses. My mother is now also a member of the cooperative's management committee, and my wife is also the leader of the women's production group. The whole family is working together.

	In fact, at that time, without the support of the masses, without the help of Yao Shengzhi, Wang Zhenghai, Wang Jinshou and others, high yields could not have been achieved.

	But young people don't think that way, attributing the work achievements to one person, and therefore becoming proud and complacent; And the result of pride is separation from the masses. Last spring, I was elected as a delegate to the Provincial People's Congress. The Provincial Party Secretary talked to me, and the Provincial Chairman ate at the same table with me. I didn't know how high the sky was or how thick the earth was. After returning from the province, I looked down on even the district and township staff, and the cooperative's staff and members were even less in my eyes. Whenever I opened my mouth, it was "So-and-so leader in the province and county said this," which made everyone not like to listen. At that time, fortunately the Party organization helped me to correct my mistakes in time, so that I understood that the achievement of any little bit of success is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the masses. Even if the personal achievements are great, one cannot be proud. What's more, my work still has many shortcomings, and I must continue to work hard.

    我们是怎样争取玉米高额丰产的
    王保京
    我是陕西省醴泉县白灵宫新庄村农业生产合作社主任。我们村从一九五一年到现在，庄稼年年丰收。光说玉米，过去每亩地的产量最高不过三、四百斤，一九五二年我们互助组的一亩七分丰产玉米，每亩打了八百五十九斤；一九五三年的八亩八分六厘丰产玉米，每亩平均打了八百八十六斤，其中有一亩二分六厘高额丰产地，每亩打了一千三百
  一十六斤十一两；一九五四年成立了农业生产合作社后，五十一亩七分七厘玉米，每亩平均打了五百六十六斤十四两，其中有一亩零九厘高额丰产地，每亩打了一千五百斤零十三两。为啥能丰收？这是坚决走了共产党所指示的农业合作化的道路和改进了耕作技术。当然，在农业合作化的道路上，是遇到了很多困难的；可是这些困难都一个一个地被我们克服了。
    第一个困难
    一九五一年那年成立了互助组，那时我们还不懂得这是农业合作化的第一步，所以不能踏实地干活，也不能联系群众，群众说我们办的是“胡做组”。后来共产党区委书记对我说：我们搞互助组，为的是带领农民走农业合作化的道路；现在你只顾自己单干，不联系群众，就好比火车头不带车厢向前跑一样，没啥用！县长对我说：要把互助组办好，就要提高单位面积产量。区委书记和县长的话，给我指出了团结群众、走农业合作化道路的方向，我心里一亮，干劲就格外大。
    第二年春上，张明亮互助组向西北农民提出挑战，说是玉米每亩要打一千零二十斤；县上开互助组长会时，我同领导上研究后，认为有条件应战。我就在会上说：他们打千零二，我们打一千二！好多老年农民从来没打过这么多粮食，就讥笑说：“这是疯子；胡说哩！”我还没回去，话就传到村里了。有的农民不信，有的农民说：“政府把他夸了夸，看他狂成啥了！”个别落后农民说：“将来打不下那么多，政府非把他押起来不可！至少也要照数包赔。”我父亲听说害了怕，成天骂我，叫我趁早把互助组收拾了。他对我说：“你要是再这样瞎胡闹，就把媳妇引走，咱各管各。”我母亲和我媳妇也不给我好脸看。有一次我参加团支部的会议回去晚了，父亲就在屋里骂，不准家里人开门。等了足有一个钟头，我媳妇才来开门。一开门她就往屋里走，一句话也不说。我心里难受极了，翻来复去睡不着，心想：闹互助，闹丰产，费尽心血，没人爱见，不如算了吧！可是又一想：不能！黄继光为了保卫祖国，保卫和平，连生命都能牺牲，咱碰到这么点困难，算得个啥呢！县长早就说过，搞互助合作，一定会碰到很多困难，咱怎么能叫困难吓倒了呢！再说，我自己受点委屈事小，要是互助组垮了，丰产搞不成，农业合作化事业就要受损失，那可就太不好了。于是我下定决心：一定要做出成绩来，用增加生产的事实说服群众和家庭。
      改变老规程
    不久，政府派技术指导站的杨建武同志来帮助我们争取丰产。他一来就告诉我：要丰产，就得使用科学的耕作技术，什么选种、密植、分期施肥、去雄杂交，等等。开始他讲我听，后来我俩争论起来了。说实话，他给我长的知识可真不少。以前我也做庄稼哩，可那是个啥做法呀！按老规程种玉米，第一就不选种，该下种了，随便弄点种籽种下。第二上的粪就不多，还不讲究分期施肥。夏田 一收，就犁就种。草多了锄草，天旱了浇水。
    为了先做个样子，我们就选定了组员郑富财家的几亩地作丰产地；可是郑富财坚决反对；后来，幸亏贫农组员姚生枝老汉帮助说服，他才同意了。这年，我们种的是经过粒选的本地黄玉米，并且每亩地留了三千四百八十株苗，比一般人留的多了一千多株。有的人认为留这样密不好，他们的理由是：“地和人一样，一个人只能拿一百斤，你偏要他拿二百斤，他怎么拿得起呢？”好像很有道理。可是我知道：过去那么个留苗法，是太稀了；实行合理密植，再增加肥料，庄稼是能长好的。于是我们就上了七车粪，还有一些油渣和化学肥料。当时因为我们对庄稼行里的许多道理还不大懂，只顾把粪往地当中倒。这种搞法会把玉米压折，烧死。王金寿老汉看见了，连忙教我们先把粪倒在地畔上，再一点一点往地里撒。施过肥，我们就浇水。
  一般人浇水都是大水漫灌，这种浇法既浪费水，又会伤害庄稼根子。因此，我们是沟灌和勤浇浅浇。这又是新办法，也有人说怪话，特别是我在前头走，后头就有人在指着脊背议论，我心里怪不好受。杨建武看见我的情绪不好，连忙对我说：“不管啥工作，总会有困难，要经得起考验，要不怕困难。”
    后来，玉米出了天花，抽了穗，我们又给做了去雄杂交和人工辅助授粉。那时候，又有人说：“真是胡成精，庄稼长得好好的，却给把头扳了。把你的头割了，看你活得成不？”我听了这话，也没理会，因为我知道：说这话的人主要是在旧社会生活的时间长了，旧思想一时还改不过来；只要把事实摆在面前，他们是会明白的。
    就在这时候，忽然下起霖雨来了，玉米又生了钻心虫。这一下可把我急坏了，一天往丰产地里跑几趟，不久我就熬煎的得了病。杨建武不许我再下地；可是我怎么能放下心呢？要是人工授粉工作搞不好，玉米给雨淋坏了，给虫咬完了，减了产，影响多不好！头一次闹丰产就失败了，往后群众还会相信吗？这时，我有点动摇，想收场不干，免得将来失败了更难看。恰好县长听说我病了，来看我。他对我说了好多的话，现在我都还牢牢地记着。他说：多少革命志士流血牺牲，艰苦奋斗才有今天的胜利；我们应该学习他们的这种革命精神来建设社会主义！我一听，是呀，建设社会主义，还能没有困难，还能半途而废！我又鼓起了勇气。后来，由于杨建武的具体帮助，组员们一齐动手，我们还是很好地完成了授粉工作，扑灭了虫害。
    尽管遭到霖雨和虫害，这年玉米还是丰产了，平均一亩地收了八百五十九斤。事实比啥都有力，群众看见互助组确实好，真正做到了增加生产，全村的农民就都纷纷加入互助组。
    力量越来越大
    接着，我们又搞大面积丰产，把八亩六分玉米地改种成麦子，计划每亩打四百斤。这时候，组员们比前更加齐心了，力量也更大了。全组四十二亩小麦，平均每亩打了三百四十九斤，其中的八亩六分丰产地，每亩打了五百五十五斤半，有一亩七分地还平均每亩打了六百九十斤，丰产计划超额完成了。一九五四年，我们全组一百二十七亩小麦，每亩平均打了三百零九斤，其中的一亩零九厘丰产地，每亩产八百二十九斤十五两。
    连年增产的事实，对群众教育很大，去年春上我们互助组就转成农业合作社。农业合作社的力量比互助组更大，我们更有条件搞大面积丰产了！这年我们种了五十一亩七分七厘玉米，其中有十八亩八分七厘红心白马牙。红心白马牙玉米的种籽，我们是一颗一颗地粒选了的，这在自耕户就办不到，互助组也有困难。我们社六月一日割麦，二日就上基肥，接着又用五寸步犁翻耕了一次，立茬曝晒了七、八天，然后用小水漫灌。作完这些后，再播种，用硫酸錏作底粪。这种作法的好处是：可以使土壤风化，积蓄大量灌水，能够促进种籽发芽，加速麦茬腐烂，防止幼苗在伏天受旱。但是，尽管有这么多好处，单干户和互助组人手少，顾了割麦，就顾不了翻地灌水。人多了，就能够积更多的肥料。村西头王改过的妈有几堵旧墙（旧墙的泥土可当肥料），她想拆掉旧墙打新墙，但是没力量；互助组人少，也闹不成。我们马上发动社员，一面拆墙，拉粪上地，一面就给她打新墙。等到粪上完了，新墙也打起来了，既给我们的社增加了肥料，又给改过他妈克服了困难。往后我们还治了四次虫，防了两次风，作了去雄杂交和人工授粉，去掉了不能授粉的雌穗和并生小穗。这一年我们的玉米长得好极了，县上、区上组织群众来参观时，大家一看，哈！秆秆有一丈二、三尺高，很多棵上都结了两个大棒棒，甚至还有结了三个四个的，这怎么能够不丰产呢！
    战胜了狂风暴雨
    可是有一天半夜，起了狂风，来了暴雨，渠里的水哗哗地流，大水下来就会把庄稼冲坏。而那几天，中农社员马书秀正在嚷着要退社，社里一连开了几晚上的会，研究怎么处理这个问题；晚上回来，我一睡下就跟死了一样，浑身都没有力气。忽然生产组长王保利来喊我，要我起来领着大家去看水。刚听见他叫，我有些不高兴，好容易才找个空睡会觉啊！可是我忽然想起了电影“春风吹到诺敏河”里的那个党支部书记，为了巩固农业合作社，他不也是在半夜里淋着雨出去工作的吗？我很快就起来，同王保利等一起跑到地里，使劲把水渠刨开了一个缺口，让水往旱地里流；这样才保住了庄稼。
    从地里回到家里，我正准备拿上家具，同群众一起去捞河水冲下来的木柴，我父亲边看天色边对我说：“这么大的风雨，玉米说不定会倒呢！”我一听慌了，心想：那一亩零九厘的丰产玉米，秆秆高，棒棒重，更容易被风吹倒；要是真的吹倒了，玉米就要减产，这对群众的影响很不好；特别是马书秀正在看农业合作社到底能不能丰产；同时，他在自留地里种了一亩玉米，要跟社里比个高低。这决不能输给了马书秀。我又想：到河边捞一次柴，虽然可以捞回一些木柴来烧火；但是，这毕竟只是个人眼前的一点小利益。我是一个共产党员，怎么能够只顾个人利益，不顾集体利益，只顾眼前利益，不顾长远利益呢！我就决定用绳子去绑玉米，把玉米保住了。
    因为耕作得好，又同各种自然灾害作了顽强的斗争，秋后社里的五十多亩玉米，每亩平均打了五百六十六斤十四两，其中的十八亩多红心白马牙玉米，每亩的产量是七百八十五斤，一亩零九厘高额丰产地，每亩打了一千五百斤零十三两。而马书秀自己种的那一亩丰产地的玉米，却只打了四百斤。马书秀承认输给了农业合作社；又因为社里庄稼丰收，他的收入也增加，所以他不但不再要求退社，而且变成了积极分子。去年冬天扩大社时，马书秀领导一个组讨论，用自己的思想转变过程，教育了其他有顾虑的中农。全村人都亲眼看到了农业合作社的好处，六十七户中就有六十五户报名入社。这真是：互助合作保证了增产，增产又推动了互助合作！
      同大家一道前进
    我开头说过，丰产全凭共产党的领导，我现在要补充一句，还因为发挥了群众的力量。
    开始搞丰产时，有些农民不但不相信，甚至讽刺我们。这主要因为他们没经过这种事情。后来情形就不同了，大家出主意，想办法。就拿我家庭作例子吧！过去我父亲不相信互助合作和丰产，对我的工作不光不帮助，还打击，我在前头喊“卖醋”，他在后头说“不酸”。如今不同了，他积极向群众宣传农业合作社的好处，用丰产事实说服大家相信新技术。我到省上、县上开会，临走时，他总要千叮咛万叮咛，要我用心开会，学本领，不要辜负了共产党、政府和群众的期望。我母亲如今也是社务管理委员会委员，我媳妇也当了妇女生产组长。一家人都干起来了。
    其实，就在那个时候，如果没有群众的支持，没有姚生枝、王正海、王金寿等人的帮助，丰产也是搞不起来的。
    可是年轻人却不是这样想，把工作成绩算做一个人的，因此骄傲自满；而骄傲的结果，就离开了群众。去年春天，我当选了省人民代表大会代表，省委书记找我谈话，省主席和我一个桌子吃饭，我就不知道天有多高地有多厚。从省里回去后，我连区、乡工作人员都看不起，社的工作人员和社员更不在眼内。我一开口，就是“省上、县上某某首长咋说来”，弄得大家不爱听。那时候，幸亏党组织及时帮助我改正了错误，使我懂得了：任何一点点成绩的取得，都是同党的领导和群众的努力分不开的。即使个人的成绩很大，也不能骄傲。何况我的工作还有很多不够的地方，必须继续努力。
