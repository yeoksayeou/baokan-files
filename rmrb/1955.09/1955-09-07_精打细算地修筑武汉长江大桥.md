Rigorously Practice Overall Economy, Overcome All Waste

    Carefully and Economically Constructing the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau has formulated an economy plan that can reduce investment by more than 24 million yuan and is now organizing all employees to complete this plan.

    This economy plan was formulated on the basis of the increased awareness of all employees, especially engineering and technical personnel and management personnel.

    After the Chinese Communist Party's Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Committee made the first mobilization to employees to vigorously practice overall economy, the vast majority of employees took action. In more than ten days, employees in seven units exposed serious facts of stockpiling and waste of more than 2.8 million yuan; 870 young workers signed up to participate in the "Youth Economy Team" to collect discarded old steel materials in their spare time. However, many management personnel and technical personnel did not take action. Some of them said, "We have Soviet experts to help, and the plan is rigorous, so there won't be any waste."

    The Party Committee believes that Soviet experts are indeed calculating carefully for our country in every way, but Soviet experts can only help us study the main technical problems, and much of the work is still done by ourselves, so it is impossible to say that there is no waste in the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau. On the contrary, the waste in the design and construction of the Yangtze River Bridge is quite serious: waste caused by improper design amounts to 950,000 yuan; non-productive construction wasted 3.95 million yuan due to the pursuit of "high standards"; each engineering unit not only failed to complete the planned profit delivery of 272,000 yuan in the first half of this year but also lost 398,000 yuan. In the third quarter of this year, it over-occupied the state's working capital by 1.13 million yuan, and was often penalized for breach of contract due to failure to pay for goods.

    It is impossible to implement overall economy and completely overcome waste without mobilizing engineering and technical personnel and management personnel who are primarily responsible for technical and management aspects. Therefore, the Party Committee reorganized management personnel and engineering and technical personnel to study documents, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and improve their awareness. After the study, they found that some engineering and technical personnel, under the guidance of the idea that "the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a rare project in the world, and the whole country is supporting it, so a little waste doesn't matter," never paid attention to economy. For example, last year, five belt conveyors were "urgently needed." The East China Construction Engineering Bureau immediately extracted five to support them, and the Shanghai Railway Bureau also specially allowed "over-height loading" to quickly transport the five machines to Wuhan. As a result, these machines lay on the construction site for four months without anyone paying attention to them. Some people think that "the Yangtze River Bridge is a new project, and everyone has no experience. It's good enough if it can be built, who cares how much money it costs?" Therefore, in budgeting and planning, they often "budget wide and use narrow" and "prepare for the worst." In design work, they emphasize "insurance" without paying attention to economy. The Soviet Appraisal Committee made three suggestions on the design of the steel beams of the bridge. The designers only considered the first suggestion and did not make different plans based on the other two suggestions for comparison. Later, when Soviet experts arrived in China, they made a new plan based on the latter two suggestions, which used more than 1,000 tons less steel and was also more convenient to construct.

    Engineering and technical personnel and management personnel further examined the root causes of these wasteful ideas, believing that the main reason was that they did not cherish the state's money as their own, and did not correctly handle the relationship between the individual and socialist construction. For example, the reason why designers simply pursue "insurance" is that they believe that they are directly responsible for the quality of the project, while the amount of money spent on the project is the responsibility of others and has nothing to do with them; planning personnel and materials personnel are also afraid that there will not be enough materials in the future, and they will be held responsible, so they try to increase the budget and buy more materials. After ideological analysis, they realized that to vigorously practice overall economy, it is necessary to eliminate individualism and correct one's attitude towards socialist construction.

    After everyone's awareness was raised, they actively formulated economy plans. This plan includes two parts: one is the total bridge budget, which will be reduced by another 16.63 million yuan on the basis of the Ministry of Railways' reduction of 14.33 million yuan; the second is the basic construction plan for 1955, which will be reduced by 7.86 million yuan based on the total budget approved by the State Council and the base number after adjusting the tasks, accounting for 17.8% of the total annual investment.

    They cut back on clubs, hospitals, large stadiums, etc., which should not have been built but had been included in the plan. The remaining buildings that must be built were also recalculated according to the new cost standards. A total of 3.08 million yuan was saved, equivalent to the total investment in building five overpasses in Wuchang.

    They reduced the conservative parts of the budget. In terms of electricity consumption for construction alone, they reduced the budget by 220,000 yuan, and temporary workers' wages were calculated according to the actual payment standard, reducing the budget by 150,000 yuan.

    The Yangtze River Bridge construction uses a lot of machinery and equipment. They originally planned to purchase three large floating cranes, three tugboats, and five large iron barges; they also planned to purchase concrete mixers, crawler cranes, etc. Now they are being reallocated by the state from various places, or old ones are being repaired and used, reducing investment by 4 million yuan.

    They reconsidered the scale and standards of various projects and revised the design while ensuring quality. Originally, Wuluo Road and Zhongshan Road were planned as eight-lane roads, and the overpasses were designed to be very long. This time, they considered that the traffic arteries in Wuhan are only six lanes wide, and these two places do not need such wide streets, so they narrowed the roads, shortened the bridges, and changed the bridge style, saving an investment of 260,000 yuan. They considered that the bearing capacity of the foundation of the bridge abutment on the Wuchang bank of the Yangtze River Bridge is very large, so they can shorten the bridge abutment foundation, reduce the number of piles and the amount of concrete, saving 550,000 yuan. They also reduced the amount of concrete and steel bars in the bearing platform of the piers of the Yangtze River Bridge through precise calculations, and changed part of the concrete sealing bottom to sand sealing bottom, saving 620,000 yuan. They revised a total of ten engineering designs, saving a total of 2.04 million yuan.

    They actively improve construction methods, increase labor productivity, and reduce costs. The second pier and the eighth pier of the Yangtze River Bridge were originally planned to be constructed using prefabricated reinforced concrete cofferdams. Now they are changed to steel sheet pile cofferdam construction, which can reduce construction costs by 800,000 yuan. The First Bridge Team increased the production of large-sized pipe piles from two sections per day to four and a half sections, and reduced the loss of construction pipe piles by 4%. This year, it can save 130,000 yuan. They also proposed 73 measures to promote advanced experience, improve the efficiency of machinery and equipment, and reduce material consumption, which can reduce costs by 2.38 million yuan.

    In addition, the Engineering Bureau also canceled the establishment of the division-level unit, re-staffed, and adjusted the organization according to the principle of streamlining the organs and enriching the construction units; and assigned special personnel to clean up fixed assets and dispose of stockpiled machinery and materials.

    In order to ensure the progress of the project and complete the economy plan, the Engineering Bureau organized most of the technical personnel headed by the chief engineer to improve the technical level under the guidance of Soviet experts, and will make a good construction organization design recently to change the abnormal situation of designing while constructing. They carefully arrange the progress of various projects to make them connect with each other; and actively prepare design documents, materials, machinery and equipment and labor, compile construction budgets, etc., so as to avoid waste caused by hasty commencement of construction.

    The Engineering Bureau, composed of finance, materials, labor wages, and construction technology departments, has organized a working group to promote five kinds of labor and material calculation systems step by step in various units from August: "Work Order," "Material Quota Card," "Work Sheet," "Material Reimbursement Form," and "Unfinished Project Inventory Form" to strengthen planned management, supervise the use of materials and labor in advance, analyze the situation afterward, and find improvement methods. They decided to continue to implement the financial final accounts system, with each construction unit executing financial final accounts on a monthly basis, and the Engineering Bureau conducting key audits on a quarterly basis. In this way, some leaders who originally did not pay attention to financial work began to pay attention to understanding and improving financial work, and corrected the problem of not making final accounts for a long time after the completion of the project.

    The main problem at present is how to combine these tasks well and make them more detailed and thorough in order to achieve the expected results. Especially since there are not many projects under construction at present, and the workload in the fourth quarter is very large, this requires the leaders of the Engineering Bureau to consciously go deep into key units, absorb experience, promote it comprehensively, and do a better job in preparing for large-scale construction.

专栏：厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费

    精打细算地修筑武汉长江大桥
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉长江大桥工程局制定了一个可以削减二千四百多万元投资的节约计划，现在正组织全体职工来完成这个计划。
    这个节约计划是在全体职工，特别是工程技术人员和管理人员提高觉悟的基础上制定的。
    中共武汉长江大桥工程局委员会第一次向职工作了厉行全面节约的动员后，绝大多数的职工都行动起来了。在十多天中，七个单位的职工就揭发了积压浪费二百八十多万元的严重事实；八百七十多名青年工人报名参加“青年节约队”，在业余时间搜集过去丢弃的钢铁旧料。但是，还有许多管理人员和技术人员没行动起来。他们之中有的说：“我们有苏联专家帮助，方案严密，不会有什么浪费。”
    党委会认为：苏联专家的确处处为我国精打细算，但是，苏联专家只能帮助我们研究主要的技术问题，许多工作还是由我们自己作，因此绝不能说武汉长江大桥工程局就没有什么浪费。相反，长江大桥工程在设计和施工中的浪费是相当严重的：由于设计不当所造成的浪费达九十五万元；非生产性建筑因为追求“高标准”而浪费三百九十五万元；各工程单位不仅没有完成今年上半年的二十七万二千元的上缴利润计划，反而亏损了三十九万八千元，今年第三季又多占用了国家流动资金一百一十三万元，还常因付不出货款而违约受罚。
    不把在技术上、管理上负主要责任的工程技术人员和管理人员发动起来，是不可能实行全面节约、彻底克服浪费的。所以党委会又重新组织管理人员和工程技术人员学习文件，开展批评和自我批评，提高他们的觉悟。经过学习以后，他们检查出：有的工程技术人员在“武汉长江大桥，世界少有的工程，全国都在支援，多少浪费点不算什么”的思想指导下，从不注意节约。例如去年“急需”皮带运输机五台，华东建筑工程局立即抽出五台来支援他们，上海铁路局也特许“超高装车”，火速把五台机器运到武汉，结果这些机器在工地上躺了四个月无人过问。有的人认为“长江大桥是新工程，大家都没经验，只要能建成就不错了，管它用多少钱呢？”因此在预算和计划上往往“宽打窄用”，“有备无患”。在设计工作上，他们强调“保险”，而不注意经济。苏联鉴定委员会对大桥钢梁设计提了三点意见，设计人员只考虑了第一点意见，没有根据另外两点意见作出不同的方案来比较。后来苏联专家到了中国，根据后两点意见作出了新的方案，比前一种方案要少用一千多吨钢料，施工也方便。
    工程技术人员和管理人员还进一步检查产生这些浪费思想的根源，认为这主要是没有把国家的钱当作自己的钱那样爱惜，没有正确处理个人同社会主义建设的关系。例如设计人员之所以单纯追求“保险”，就是认为他们对工程质量要直接负责，而工程花钱多少则另有人负责，跟他们无关；计划人员和材料人员也是怕将来材料不够，自己要负责任，所以就尽量加大预算，多买材料。他们在经过思想分析后，认识到要厉行全面节约，就要肃清个人主义，端正自己对待社会主义建设的态度。
    大家的认识提高以后，积极订出节约方案。这个方案包括两部分：一是全桥总预算，在铁道部核减了一千四百三十三万元的基础上，再降低一千六百六十三万元；二是一九五五年的基本建设计划，根据国务院批准的总预算和调整任务后的基数，降低七百八十六万元，占年度总投资额百分之十七点八。
    他们把不应修建但已列入计划的俱乐部、医院、大体育场等削减了。剩下若干必须修建的房屋，也按新的造价标准重新计算。一共节约了三百○八万元，相当于修建武昌五座跨线桥的投资总和。
    他们削减了预算中的保守部分，仅在施工用电方面，就削减了预算二十二万元，临时工工资按实际支付的标准计算，削减了预算十五万元。
    长江大桥施工所用的机具很多。他们原来计划购买三艘大吊船，三艘拖轮、五艘大铁驳；还计划购买混凝土搅拌机、爬行吊车等。现在改由国家统一从各地调拨，或调旧的来加以修理使用，减少了投资四百万元。
    他们重新考虑了各项工程的规模、标准，在保证质量的条件下，修改了设计。原来武珞路和中山路都是按八车道计划的，跨线桥都设计得很长。他们这次考虑武汉市的交通干线都只有六车道，这两处也不需要这样宽的街道，便将路改窄，将桥缩短，并改变桥式，节约投资二十六万元。他们考虑长江大桥武昌岸桥台地基的承压力很大，可以缩短桥台基础，减少打桩数量和混凝土数量，节约五十五万元。他们还经过精确计算，减少长江大桥桥墩承台的混凝土和钢筋数量，并将部分混凝土封底改为砂子封底，节约六十二万元。他们一共修改了十项工程设计，共节约二百零四万元。
    他们积极改进施工方法，提高劳动生产率，降低成本。长江大桥的二号桥墩和八号桥墩原计划采用预制钢筋混凝土围堰的施工方法，现在改为用钢板桩围堰施工，可降低施工成本八十万元。第一桥梁队制造大型管柱由每日生产两节提高到四节半，并减少施工管柱损耗百分之四，今年可节约十三万元。他们还在推广先进经验、提高机具使用效率、降低材料消耗等方面提出了七十三条措施，可降低成本二百三十八万元。
    另外，工程局还根据精简机关、充实施工单位的原则，取消处一级的编制，重新定员，调整机构；派专人清理固定资产，处理积压的机具、材料。
    为了保证工程进度和完成节约计划，工程局组织了以总工程师为首的大部分技术人员，在苏联专家指导下，提高技术水平，要在最近作好施工组织设计，改变边设计边施工的不正常状况。他们仔细地安排各项工程的进度，使之相互衔接；并积极准备设计文件、材料、机具和劳动力、编制施工预算等，以免仓促开工造成浪费。
    工程局由财务、材料、劳动工资和施工技术等部门组成工作组，从八月份起有步骤地在各单位推行“工作命令单”、“材料限额卡”、“计工单”、“材料报销单”、“未完工程盘定单”等五种计工计料制度，加强计划管理，事前监督材料和劳动力的使用，事后分析情况，找出改进办法。他们决定继续贯彻财务决算制度，各施工单位按月执行财务决算，工程局按季进行重点审核。这样，一些原来不重视财务工作的领导人员都开始注意了解和改进财务工作，并改正了工程完工后长期不作出决算的毛病。
    目前的问题主要在于如何把这些工作结合好，并作得更细致、更深入些，以收到预期的效果。特别是目前施工的工程不多，而第四季度的工作量很大，这就更加需要工程局的领导人员有意识地深入重点单位，吸收经验，全面推广，把大规模施工的准备工作作得更好些。
