    How to Study China's Mathematical Heritage
    Guan Zhaozhi
    Over the generations, our country has accumulated considerable knowledge in mathematics, but unfortunately much of it has been lost. However, from the materials that have been preserved, our ancestors made many contributions to this science. Sorting out this heritage, correctly evaluating it, and critically accepting it is a very meaningful task. The recently published "Historical Materials of Ancient Chinese Mathematics" and "Collected Essays on the History of Chinese Mathematics," Volumes 1-5, by Li Yan, and "Studies of Algebra by Chinese Mathematicians," "Studies of Geometry by Chinese Mathematicians," "Chinese Arithmetic Stories," and "Ancient Arithmetic Fun" by Xu Chunfang, have all made certain efforts in organizing historical materials and popularizing them.
    Li Yan's works have the following advantages and characteristics: First, they collect a considerable amount of material and examine the dates of some major achievements of ancient Chinese mathematicians, thereby affirming the priority of Chinese mathematics in some inventions and discoveries and refuting the erroneous idea of blindly worshiping the West and neglecting the cultural heritage of the motherland with concrete materials. For example, a numerical solution method for finding real roots of higher-order algebraic equations is called Horner's method (or Honiere's method) in European and American books. According to Li Yan's textual research, the method used by Liu Yi of the Song Dynasty to solve quadratic equations was similar to Horner's method, more than 700 years earlier than Horner's invention (1819); later, Jia Xian of the Song Dynasty used a similar method, about 600 years earlier than Horner; Qin Jiushao of the Song Dynasty's method for solving higher-order equations was completely similar to Horner's method, more than 500 years earlier. Before liberation, because European and American textbooks were widely used, middle school students only knew "Horner's method" and did not know the names of Liu Yi, Jia Xian, and Qin Jiushao, which is the most prominent example. For another example, the calculation of pi has always been credited to Europeans. According to Li Yan's textual research, it was mentioned in our "Zhou Bi Suan Jing." Subsequently, there were varying degrees of development in this area in various periods, especially Zu Chongzhi of the Southern Qi Dynasty, who made relatively precise calculations of pi. In Europe, it was not until the German Otto calculated the value of pi accurate to six decimal places, more than 1,100 years later than China's Zu Chongzhi!
    Second, it uses modern language and symbols to explain the achievements in ancient calculation books. For example, the first volume of "Collected Essays on the History of Chinese Mathematics" introduces in detail the research of Chinese mathematicians in fractions, Gougu (right triangle), root extraction, equation solving, series theory, and binomial expansion coefficients, enabling the general readers to overcome the difficulties regarding the text and symbols in ancient books.
    Third, the author also collected a lot of materials on the mutual relations between China and Korea, Japan, India, and Islamic countries in astronomy and mathematics, illustrating the mutual influence between China and other countries in the development of mathematics.
    Finally, the author also lists a relatively large number of bibliographies and introduces brief biographies of ancient mathematicians and the mathematical education systems of previous dynasties, which can provide preliminary organized references for future writers of Chinese science history.
    Xu Chunfang's popular works introduce the achievements of ancient Chinese mathematics in a more accessible way, enabling these legacies to be accepted by a wider audience.
    At present, the Chinese mathematics community has not done enough in the study of the history of Chinese mathematics. The above-mentioned works do not adequately address some important issues in the history of Chinese mathematics. Here, I will offer some reference opinions on several noteworthy issues in further studying the history of Chinese mathematics.
    Mathematics is not a free creation of human thought, but ultimately arises from practical needs. Furthermore, mathematics is an organic component of the whole formed by various natural science departments, and the understanding of the overall natural laws is obtained in human material production activities. Therefore, in the study of the history of mathematics, the birth and development of mathematics should be explained from two aspects. That is, on the one hand, it should be explained that mathematics originates from the direct needs of human production. Of course, at a certain stage of the development of mathematics, many problems and theories will arise due to the inherent needs of mathematics itself; however, in the earlier stages of the development of mathematics, the connection between mathematics and the requirements of direct production practice is very obvious. For example, the "Fangtian" chapter in "Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art," one of China's oldest calculation books, discusses the calculation of land area; the oldest record of the concept of fractions is also related to the manufacture of wheels, etc. On the other hand, we must never find the basis for every step in the development of mathematics from direct production needs; we must explain that mathematics is indirectly promoted by other scientific and technological knowledge for production needs. Astronomical knowledge and calendar-making are closely related to agricultural production, and ancient Chinese mathematics was inseparable from astronomy. For example, the study of the calendar requires complex fractional algorithms, which promotes the development of fractional algorithms. In 104 BC, the Three Unifications Calendar already knew how to convert complex fractions into simple fractions when calculating the average speed of Jupiter. "Historical Materials of Ancient Chinese Mathematics" points out that Liu Zhuo of the Sui Dynasty studied "Zhaochai Art" (i.e., interpolation method) to make the "Huangji Calendar," and Qin Jiushao's Dayanyanqiuyi Art (a method of solving simultaneous congruence equations) in the Song Dynasty was also used to solve problems in calendar making. In addition, China has made outstanding achievements in architecture, navigation, water conservancy, and various handicrafts throughout history, and these must be closely related to the development of mathematics at that time. This can be seen from the fact that some famous ancient mathematicians were also proficient in other engineering technologies, such as Xu Shang of the Han Dynasty, who was engaged in the construction of water conservancy, Zhang Heng of the Han Dynasty, who was "good at ingenuity," and Zu Chongzhi of the Song Dynasty, who "made the guide vehicle." In this regard, we should do more precise research.
    The study of the history of mathematics should focus on explaining the process of formation and development of basic concepts in mathematics, that is, it should show that "cognition begins with practice, and after practice, theoretical cognition is obtained, and it must return to practice." (Mao Zedong: "On Practice") Liu Hui of the Wei Dynasty already had the germ of the concept of limit in his works. In his commentary on "Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art," he said when discussing the calculation of pi: "The more finely divided, the smaller the loss; dividing again and again, until it cannot be divided, then it is combined with the circumference and there is no loss." This means that the finer the division, the less the difference; dividing again and again, until it cannot be divided, then it is equal to the circumference and there is no difference. This concept arose from the need to calculate the area of circles and other practical geometric problems, was abstracted through thinking, and then was applied to practical problems and tested. Liu Hui used this concept to obtain a value of pi of 3.14, thereby obtaining more accurate results in calculating the area of circles and other problems. The development process of other concepts, such as numbers (positive integers, fractions, and negative numbers, etc.) and area, is also the same. We should describe this process of cognition based on historical materials. Past research has focused on the textual research and organization of historical materials, and has not done enough in this regard.
    With the development of mathematics, there will inevitably be various views on mathematics as a science, which also shows the struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of the development of mathematics. Ancient Chinese idealist philosophy often shrouded mathematics in mysticism. For example, in the Song and Ming dynasties, some mathematicians engaged in the study of magic squares, a branch of mathematics that is rarely related to other sciences and technologies. Whether this had a negative impact on the development of mathematics in our country is a question worth studying. In addition, the views of Chinese materialists on mathematics and other sciences have rarely been studied.
    Focusing on practical calculation methods and specific problem-solving methods is one of the characteristics of Chinese mathematics. For example, the invention of the root-finding method for higher-order algebraic equations and the method for solving simultaneous congruence equations mentioned above can illustrate this point. This is very similar to some Eastern countries, especially some countries in Central Asia and the Near East, but very different from the Greek emphasis on logical systems (represented by Euclidean geometry). In addition, what other characteristics does Chinese mathematics have? This remains to be found. The research on these characteristics must be linked to the study of general cultural history, the history of philosophical thought, and even the economic base at that time, so it requires the joint efforts of mathematicians and scholars of other sciences.
    Finally, in the study of the history of mathematics, we must resolutely fight against the remnants of comprador ideology left over from the past semi-colonial society and the bourgeois cosmopolitanism spread by imperialist countries, and oppose the tendency to underestimate, belittle, and even obliterate China's mathematical heritage. At the same time, we must also more comprehensively find out the mutual influence of Chinese mathematics with the mathematics of other countries, especially Korea, Vietnam, India, Japan, and the countries of Central Asia and the Near East.
    It is hoped that more mathematicians will jointly care about and attach importance to China's mathematical heritage, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and further develop the research work on the history of Chinese mathematics.

    怎样研究我国数学遗产
    关肇直
    我国历代在数学方面积累了不少知识，可惜其中很多已经失传。但从留传下来的材料看，我们的祖先对这门科学曾有过不少贡献。整理这些遗产，正确地加以估价，批判地接受这些遗产，是一件很有意义的工作。最近出版的李俨的“中国古代数学史料”和“中算史论丛”第一至五集，以及许莼舫的“中算家的代数学研究”、“中算家的几何学研究”、“中国算术故事”和“古算趣味”等书，在史料的整理和通俗化等方面，都做了一定的努力。
    李俨的著作有着下述优点和特点：第一、搜集了相当丰富的材料，考订了我国古代数学家的一些重大成就的年代，从而肯定了我国数学在一些发明和发现上的优先地位，以具体材料驳斥了盲目崇拜西方、忽视祖国文化遗产的错误思想。例如，求高次代数方程实根的一种数值解法，欧美书中称为霍纳（或译和涅）法。根据李俨的考订，宋代刘益解二次方程所用的方法已同霍纳法相似，而比霍纳法的发明（一八一九年）早七百多年；后来，宋代贾宪使用相似的方法，比霍纳约早六百年；宋代秦九韶解高次方程的方法，更同霍纳法完全相似，而比霍纳法早五百多年。解放前由于普遍使用欧美课本，中学生都只知道“霍纳法”，而不知道刘益、贾宪和秦九韶等人的名字，这是一个最突出的例子。又如，关于圆周率的计算，也一直被归功于欧洲人。根据李俨的考订，我国“周髀算经”里就曾提到过。其后各时期在这方面都有不同程度的发展，特别是南齐的祖冲之对于圆周率又做了比较精密的计算。而在欧洲，德国人鄂图才计算出准确到小数六位的圆周率值，却比中国祖冲之晚了一千一百多年！
    第二，用现代的语言和符号说明了古算书中的成就。例如，“中算史论丛”第一集中详细地介绍了中国数学家在分数、句股、开方、方程解法、级数论和二项式展开系数等方面的研究，使得广大的读者克服了关于古书中文字符号的困难。
    第三，作者还搜集了不少关于我国同朝鲜、日本、印度和伊斯兰教诸国在天文数学等方面的相互关系的材料，说明我国同其他国家在数学发展上的相互影响。
    最后，作者还列举了较多的文献目录，介绍了古数学家的简传和历朝的数学教育制度，这可以给将来编写中国科学史的著作人提供了经过初步整理的参考文献。
    许莼舫的通俗性著作，则用更易懂的方式，介绍了我国古代数学的成就，使得这些遗产能为更广大的读者所接受。
    目前，中国数学界在研究中国数学史方面，是还做得很不够的。上面所提这些著作中，对于中国数学史上的一些重要问题，也还没有足够论及。这里，就进一步研究中国数学史中值得注意的几个问题，提供一些参考意见。
    数学不是人类思惟的自由创造，而归根结底是由实践的需要产生的。并且，数学乃是由各种自然科学部门所结合成的整体中的有机构成部分，而对整体的自然规律性的了解是在人类物质生产活动中获得的。因此，在数学史的研究中，就应该从两方面说明数学的诞生和发展。即一方面说明数学是从人类生产直接需要中产生的。固然在数学的一定发展阶段上，很多问题和理论会由于数学本身的内在需要产生；但是在数学发展的较早阶段，数学同直接生产实践要求的关联非常明显。例如，我国最古的算书之一“九章算术”中“方田”章，讲的就是田地面积的计算；关于分数概念的最古记载，也是同制造车轮等联系着的。另一方面，我们决不能把数学发展中的每一步骤都从直接生产需要找到根据；我们必须说明数学通过其他科学技术知识而间接地为生产需要所推进。天文常识和制历等都同农业生产有着密切关系，我国古时数学同天文也是分不开的。例如，历法的研究需要繁复的分数算法，从而推动了分数算法的发展。公元前一○四年，三统历法计算木星的平均速度，就已知道把繁分数化为简单分数。“中国古代数学史料”中指出，隋代刘焯研究“招差术”（即现在的内插法）用以作“皇极历”，宋代秦九韶的大衍求一术（解联立等余式的一种方法）也是用来解决制历上的问题的。另外，我国历代在建筑、航海、水利以及种种手工业等方面都有卓越的成就，而这些同当时数学发展也必然有密切的关系。从一些著名古数学家兼长于其他工程技术这一事实，如汉代许商曾从事修建水利、汉代张衡“善机巧”和宋代祖冲之“造指南车”等就可看出。在这方面，我们应当做更精密的研究。
    数学史的研究应当着重说明数学中基本概念形成和发展的过程，即应当表现出“认识从实践始，经过实践得到了理论的认识，还须再回到实践去。”（毛泽东：“实践论”）魏人刘徽的著作里就已有了极限概念的萌芽。他在所注的“九章算术”中论求圆周率时说：“割之弥细，所失弥小，割之又割，以至不可割，则与圆周合体，而无所失矣。”这就是说，割得愈细，所差愈少，割了再割，直到不能割，那时候就同圆周相等而没有差了。这一概念产生于计算圆面积等实际几何问题需要，经过思考作用而被加以抽象化，然后又被用到实际问题上去而得到考验。刘徽运用了这一概念求得圆周率为三点一四，从而在计算圆面积等问题上得到较精确的结果。其他如数（正整数、分数和负数等）和面积等概念的发展过程也是如此。我们应当根据史料描述出这种认识的过程。过去的研究偏重史料的考订和整理，而在这方面则做得很不够。
    随着数学的发展，必然生出对数学这门科学的种种看法，也就表现出在数学发展史上唯物论同唯心论的斗争。我国古代唯心论哲学也往往把数学罩上神秘主义色彩。例如，宋、明等时代颇有一些数学家从事研究纵横图这一门同其它科学和技术很少关联的数学。这对于我国数学发展是否起了不良的影响，就是很值得研究的。此外，我国唯物论者对数学等科学的看法，也还很少有人研究过。
    注重实用计算方法和具体解题方法，是我国数学的特色之一。例如，前面所提过的高次代数方程根求法和解联立等余式方法的发明，都可以说明这一点。这同东方一些国家，特别是中亚细亚和近东一些国家很相似，而同希腊的着重逻辑体系（以欧几里得几何为代表）则很不同。此外，我国数学还有哪些特点，也有待于找出。这些特色的研究，必须同一般文化史、哲学思想史乃至当时经济基础的研究联系起来，因而要靠数学家和其它科学的学者共同努力。
    最后，在数学史的研究中，我们必须同过去半殖民地社会中遗留下来买办思想的残余，同由帝国主义国家传来的资产阶级世界主义思想作坚决斗争，反对低估、轻视乃至抹杀我国数学遗产的倾向。同时，也要更全面地找出我国数学同其他国家，特别是朝鲜、越南、印度、日本以及中亚细亚近东诸国的数学的相互影响。
    希望有更多的数学家们共同关怀和重视中国的数学遗产，加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习，进一步开展中国数学史的研究工作。
