    “666” is Not a “Cure-All”
    To the Editor:
    In recent years, farmers in Liuhe County, Jilin Province, have used "666" to control crop pests and have achieved great results. Therefore, some people mistakenly believe that "666" is a "cure-all" and use it indiscriminately. Mu Decai, a management committee member of the Dongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dong'an Village, Fifth District of Liuhe, used "666" to treat "skin abrasions" on the necks of horses. As a result, the necks of two horses became even more severely rotten. Fortunately, some cooperative members understood the nature and function of "666" and quickly washed the horses' necks clean and asked the veterinary prevention and treatment station for treatment, which saved the lives of the two horses. Some time ago, rice blast occurred in the paddy fields of the Xinchun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dadu Village. They also sprayed a lot of "666," which wasted medicine and prevented the rice blast from being treated in time, causing it to continue to spread.
    Therefore, I suggest that agricultural technicians in various regions explain the properties of "666" to the farmers and educate them not to use "666" as a "cure-all" to avoid danger and losses.

### “六六六”不是“万灵药”

    “六六六”不是“万灵药”编辑同志：
    吉林柳河县农民近年来使用“六六六”防治作物害虫，收效极好。因此，有些人误认“六六六”是“万灵药”，拿来胡乱使用。柳河五区东安村东兴屯日升农业生产合作社的管理委员牟德才，用“六六六”治马脖子上的“破皮病”，结果两匹马的脖子烂得更严重了；幸亏有的社员明白“六六六”的性质和作用，赶紧把马脖子洗净，请兽医防治所治疗，才保住了两匹马的性命。前些天大肚村新春农业生产合作社的水稻发生了稻热病，他们也打了很多“六六六”，浪费了药，还使稻热病不能及时治好而继续蔓延。
    因此，我建议各地农业技术干部要向农民群众说清楚“六六六”的性能，教育农民不要把“六六六”当做“万灵药”来用，以免发生危险和损失。
