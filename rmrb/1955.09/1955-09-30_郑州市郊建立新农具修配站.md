The Zhengzhou Agricultural Technology Guidance Station and the New-Style Farm Implement Promotion Station in Henan Province have organized some workers from ironware production cooperatives to establish five new-style farm implement repair stations in the five market towns of Lihe, Gucheng, Jicheng, Xushui, and Jiagang in the Zhengzhou suburbs. These stations will address the difficulties farmers in these areas face in repairing and maintaining new-style farm implements such as walking plows, double-shared plows, and waterwheels.

Over the past five years, Zhengzhou suburbs have promoted more than 900 walking plows, more than 450 double-shared plows, more than 1,670 various new-style waterwheels, and more than 8,000 other new farm implements. These farm implements have played a significant role in increasing agricultural production, but farmers have been unable to repair them when they break down. The establishment of new-style farm implement repair stations will not only allow farmers to repair farm implements but also provide farmers with technical instruction on their use at any time.

    郑州市郊建立新农具修配站
    河南郑州市农业技术指导站和新式农具推广站组织铁业生产合作社的部分工人，在郑州郊区里河、古荥、祭城、须水、尖岗五个集镇分别建立了五个新式农具修配站，解决这些地带农民修配步犁、双铧犁、水车等新式农具的困难。
    郑州市郊五年来推广新式步犁九百多张，双铧犁四百五十多张，各种新式水车一千六百七十多部，其他各种新农具八千多件。这些农具在农业增产中起了很大的作用，但一坏农民就没法修理，新式农具修配站建立后，不仅可以给农民修配农具，还可随时向农民传授使用技术。（本报驻郑州记者）
