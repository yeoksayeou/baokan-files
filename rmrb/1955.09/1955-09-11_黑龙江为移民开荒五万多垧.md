Heilongjiang is currently engaged in the intensive reclamation of wasteland for immigrants across the province. As of the end of August, more than 55,000 hectares of wasteland have been opened up, accounting for 50% of the task of reclaiming wasteland for immigrants. Some counties that acted earlier, such as Zhaozhou, Lanxi, Mingshui, Anda, and Kedong, have successively completed their wasteland reclamation tasks. Qing'an, Nenjiang, Nehe, Hailun, Mishan, Yian, Gannan, Lindian, Bei'an, Dedu, and Suihua, as well as the Heihe area, have completed more than 80% of their wasteland reclamation tasks. According to inspections, the reclaimed wasteland basically meets the quality standards stipulated by the province. The average depth of the 1,601 hectares of wasteland that has been opened up in Qing'an County is more than 15 centimeters, with only 28 hectares being insufficient in depth. The county plans to harrow and level it once more next spring, and after compaction, it can be guaranteed for sowing. The depth of the reclaimed wasteland in Nehe County is generally 14 centimeters, with some reaching more than 15 centimeters.

Currently, the work of reclaiming wasteland for immigrants is entering an intensive stage. Farmers in various places, as well as tractor drivers from state-owned farms and tractor stations, have resolutely expressed their determination to guarantee the completion of the plan for reclaiming wasteland for immigrants, to support immigrant production, and to increase grain production for the country.

    黑龙江为移民开荒五万多垧
    为移民开垦荒地工作，目前正在黑龙江省各地紧张进行。到八月底统计，已经开出荒地五万五千多垧，占为移民垦荒任务的百分之五十。有些行动较早的县，如肇州、兰西、明水、安达和克东等五县已经先后完成开荒任务；庆安、嫩江、讷河、海伦、密山、依安、甘南、林甸、北安、德都、绥化等十一县和黑河地区已完成开荒任务百分之八○以上。据检查，已经开出的荒地基本上合乎省里规定的质量标准。庆安县已开出的一六○一垧荒地一般深度均在十五公分以上，只有二十八垧深度不够。该县计划明春再耙、捞一次，经过镇压还可以保证播种。讷河县已开出的荒地，深度一般的达十四公分，好的达十五公分以上。
    目前，为移民垦荒工作正进入紧张阶段，各地农民们和国营农场、拖拉机站的拖拉机手们，都坚决表示要保证完成为移民开荒的计划，支援移民生产，为国家增产粮食。　（李绍白）
