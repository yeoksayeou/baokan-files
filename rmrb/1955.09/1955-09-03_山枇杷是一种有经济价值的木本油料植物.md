    Chinese Bayberry is a Woody Oil Plant with Economic Value

    To the Editor:
    In the Daqingshan Mountains of Guangxi, there is a woody oil plant with great economic value called Chinese Bayberry. This plant has not yet been noticed and utilized by people.

    Chinese Bayberry, also known as Oil He Wood, Ke Fruit, Rice Soup Ke, Golden Fruit, etc., is an evergreen arbor. The trunk of this tree can reach a height of ten meters, with a diameter at breast height of about forty centimeters. The material is of medium weight and dries well, making it suitable for building and furniture materials. Its fruit is similar in shape to wild peaches, bearing a large crop every other year. During the peak fruiting period of a Chinese Bayberry tree (fifteen to sixty years old), the annual fruit yield is about two hundred catties (the highest being more than four hundred catties), and each hundred catties of fresh fruit can yield twenty catties of seeds. The kernels can be used to extract oil, with each catty yielding about six and a half taels of pure oil. The extracted oil has a fragrant aroma and yellow color, and its quality is very good. It can be eaten without further refining, and local people think it is better than peanut oil. This oil can also be used for lighting lamps, which are very bright and smokeless. The oil residue has a bitter taste and can be used to treat pests and as fertilizer.

    Chinese Bayberry seedlings prefer humid and hot conditions, so they often grow under other trees. The soil requires slightly acidic humus soil. In Daqingshan, wild Chinese Bayberry mostly grows in relatively moist valleys, foothills, hillsides, and forests, and some also grow in highlands at an altitude of 900 meters. This tree can also be planted artificially. Direct seeding or tree planting in spring is suitable, and the germination ability is strong, so it can be nurtured and renewed. According to the experience of Daqingshan Forest Farm, the survival rate of direct seeding afforestation in 1955 reached 81%. Seedlings cultivated for one year, with a height of 40 centimeters, can be transplanted that year, and they begin to bear fruit six or seven years after planting.

    I believe that developing this crop in areas suitable for planting Chinese Bayberry can produce a large amount of timber and oil for the motherland, which is of great economic value. I hope that relevant departments will pay attention to research, plant more, and make better use of this woody oil plant.

### 山枇杷是一种有经济价值的木本油料植物

    山枇杷是一种有经济价值的木本油料植物编辑同志：
    在广西大青山有一种很有经济价值的木本油料植物，叫做山枇杷。这种植物现在还没有被人们注意利用。
    山枇杷俗名油呵木、柯果、米汤柯、金色果等，是一种常绿乔木。这种树木的主干高达十公尺，胸高直径约四十公分，材质轻重中等，干燥程度良好，适宜于做建筑、家具用的材料。它的果子形状和野生桃果差不多，隔年一大结。一株山枇杷在结果盛期（十五至六十年树龄）大年产果量约二百斤左右（最高有四百多斤），每百斤生果可得种子二十斤。种仁可以用来榨油，每斤约可以榨净油六两半。榨出来的油味香色黄，质量很好，不要再经过提炼就可以食用，当地群众认为比花生油好吃。这种油用来点灯，也很明亮，而且还没有烟。油渣带有苦味，可用来治害虫，也能用来做肥料。
    山枇杷的幼苗性喜湿热，因此常常生长在其他树木的下面；土质要求偏于酸性的腐植壤土。在大青山上，野生的山枇杷多长在比较湿润的山谷、山脚、山腰和林中，有的也长在海拔九百公尺的高地。这种林木也可以人工造林，在春季用直播或植树两种方法都很适宜，萌芽力也强，可以进行抚育更新。根据大青山林场的经验，一九五五年直播造林成活率达百分之八十一。育苗一年生，苗高四十公分，可当年出山，栽后六、七年就开始结果。
    我认为，在适宜种植山枇杷的地区发展这种作物，可以为祖国生产大量的木材和油料，是很有经济价值的。希望有关部门注意研究，更多地种植和更好地利用这种木本油料植物。
