    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 3rd: Japanese Foreign Minister Aoi Shigemitsu's guarantee to the United States during the US-Japan talks that Japan would "contribute to international peace and security in the Western Pacific" has aroused opposition and serious unease among the Japanese public. According to Washington reports carried by Tokyo newspapers, this guarantee commits Japan to the obligation of sending troops overseas.
    The Hatoyama Cabinet held a "heated debate" on this matter on the 2nd. At the meeting, cabinet ministers believed that sending Japanese troops abroad would violate the constitution. They invited Masayuki Tani, an aide to Shigemitsu Aoi and advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to attend the meeting and asked him to clarify whether Japan had an obligation to send troops abroad and whether the United States had demanded that Japan expand its military strength to 350,000 men. Tani did not give a definite answer to the first question; regarding the second question, he said that he did not believe that the United States was demanding that Japan expand its military to 350,000 men. Since Tani's explanation was not satisfactory, the Cabinet decided to ask Shigemitsu Aoi to provide detailed information on this matter.
    According to Kyodo News, both the left and right wings of the Socialist Party have decided to hold a joint meeting of their general secretaries on the 5th to discuss the issue of holding the government accountable for Shigemitsu Aoi's guarantee.
    Many Japanese newspapers published editorials condemning Shigemitsu Aoi's guarantee. "Mainichi Shimbun" said: Sending troops abroad means resolving international disputes by force, which violates the constitution. The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese House of Councillors passed a resolution last year opposing the dispatch of troops abroad and demanded that the government clarify this issue. "Asahi Shimbun" said: "We do not want to believe this news."
    According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on the 2nd, the Shigemitsu Aoi-Dulles joint communique has "caused concern and unease in Japan. Shigemitsu Aoi's promise of defense obligations may cause a political storm."
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 3rd: Japanese Foreign Minister Aoi Shigemitsu has publicly defended his position of wanting Japan to send troops abroad. According to United Press International, Aoi Shigemitsu said at a press conference in New York on the 2nd that there is "considerable room for debate" as to whether sending Japanese troops abroad violates the constitution. He said that the issue of amending the constitution on this point is currently under study.
    According to a report from Washington by Kyodo News special correspondent Iwatate, the Japanese side made a guarantee during the US-Japan talks to send Japanese troops overseas in the future, and this guarantee was implicitly stipulated in the US-Japan joint communique. Iwatate believes that the denial by the Japanese Embassy in Washington is a "sophistry."

    重光葵在日美会谈中承担派遣军队到国外去的义务
    日本广大公众表示反对和不安
    新华社三日讯　东京消息：日本外务相重光葵在日美会谈中向美国保证日本要对“西太平洋的国际和平和安全作出贡献”，引起了日本公众的反对与严重不安。据东京各报登载的华盛顿消息说，这个保证使日本承担了派遣军队到海外的义务。
    鸠山内阁在二日为此举行了一次“辩论激烈”的会议。会上，内阁大臣们认为把日本军队派出国外是违反宪法的。他们把重光葵的助手、外务省顾问谷正之请去参加会议，要他说明：日本是否有义务把军队派到国外去；美国是否要求日本把军队的实力扩充到三十五万人。谷正之对于前一个问题没有作肯定的答复；对于第二个问题，他说，他不相信美国要求日本把军队扩充到三十五万人。由于谷正之的说明不能令人满意，内阁决定要求重光葵对此提供详细的消息。
    据共同社报道，左、右两派社会党已经决定在五日举行两党总书记会谈，讨论就重光葵的保证，并向政府追究责任的问题。
    日本很多报纸发表社论，谴责重光葵的这种保证。“每日新闻”说：派兵出国意味着用武力解决国际争端，这是违反宪法的。这家报纸说明了去年日本国会参议院曾通过反对派兵出国的决议，并且要求政府澄清这个问题。“朝日新闻”说：“我们不愿相信这个消息”。
    据法新社东京二日电报道，重光葵—杜勒斯联合公报已在日本“引起了担心和不安。重光葵答应防御义务一事可能会引起政治风暴。”
    新华社三日讯　纽约消息：日本外务相重光葵公开地为他要日本派遣军队到国外去的立场辩护。据合众社报道，重光葵二日在纽约记者招待会上说，关于派遣日本军队到国外是否违反宪法一节，有“相当大的争辩余地”。他说，现在正在研究在这一点上修改宪法的问题。
    另据共同社特派记者岩立自华盛顿报道说：在这次日美会谈中，日方曾经提出将来派日军去海外的保证，这个保证在日美联合公报中含蓄地作了规定。岩立认为日本驻华盛顿大使馆的否认是一种“狡辩”。
