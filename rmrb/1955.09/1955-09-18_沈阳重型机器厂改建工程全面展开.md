    Renovation Project of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant Fully Underway
    The renovation project of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant has been fully launched. Construction of the plant buildings for the cast steel, scrap steel, riveting and welding, medium-sized metalworking, heavy-duty metalworking, and assembly workshops, as well as the boiler room, wood model warehouse, outdoor pipelines, plant area cables, central laboratory, and other projects planned for this year have all commenced one after another.
    Currently, from the ground to high altitudes, dozens of trades and over a thousand workers are simultaneously engaged in overlapping operations. The steel columns of the heavy-duty metalworking and assembly workshop buildings, which are being expanded, have already been erected row by row. Overhead cranes are delivering prefabricated beams to the steel columns six to seven zhang (approximately 20-23 meters) high, where riveting and welding workers are welding them together at high altitudes. The construction of the medium-sized metalworking, riveting and welding, wood model warehouse, central laboratory, and other construction projects, which are progressing relatively quickly, have entered the final stages.
    Over the past month or so, with the continuous expansion of the workload, the Northeast Second Engineering Company, Changchun Metal Structure Company, and Shanghai Boiler Installation Company, which are responsible for the construction tasks of this plant, have successively transferred a large number of engineering management personnel, technical personnel, and workers to participate in the construction here. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the Northeast Second Engineering Company, which is responsible for the civil engineering construction tasks of the entire plant, has formulated plans for labor allocation, material supply, and technical measures adapted to the ten-day progress schedule, and has implemented a management responsibility system for work sections and teams. Production scheduling meetings are held every day to check the progress of the project and solve temporary problems that arise during construction. The workers have also launched a labor competition to strive to complete the construction tasks ahead of schedule. Recently, they have exceeded the daily progress plan every day.

    沈阳重型机器厂改建工程全面展开
    沈阳重型机器厂改建工程已经全面展开。今年计划修建的铸钢、废钢、铆焊、中型金工、重型金工、装配等车间的厂房和锅炉房、木型仓库、户外管道、厂区电缆、中央试验室等工程都已相继施工。
    目前，从地面到高空，几十个工种、一千多名工人正在同时进行交叉作业。正在扩建的重型金工、装配车间厂房的钢柱子已经一排排竖立起来，起重吊车正在把一个个预制的梁架送到六、七丈高的钢柱上，铆焊工人便在高空中将它们焊接起来。施工进展较快的中型金工、铆焊等车间和木型仓库、中央试验室等建筑工程已进入收尾阶段。
    最近一个多月以来，随着工作量的不断扩大，担负这个厂建设任务的东北第二工程公司、长春金属结构公司、上海锅炉安装公司接连抽调了大批工程管理人员、技术人员和工人来到这里参加建设。为了加速工程的进展，担负全厂土木建筑工程任务的东北第二工程公司，编制了和旬日进度计划相适应的劳动力配备、材料供应、技术措施等计划，推行了工段、小组的管理责任制度。每天都召开生产调度会议，检查工程进度，解决施工中临时发生的问题。工人们也展开了争取提前完成施工任务的劳动竞赛。他们最近每天都超额完成了日进度计划。（新华社）
