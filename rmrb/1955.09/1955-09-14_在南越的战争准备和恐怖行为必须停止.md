    War Preparations and Acts of Terror in South Vietnam Must Stop
    By Zhan Chao, Staff Reporter in Vietnam
    On September 11, the Ministry of National Defense of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a press conference to announce a memorandum from General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, to Mr. Desai, Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam. The memorandum listed many irrefutable facts, reminding the relevant parties to pay close attention: the war preparations and acts of terror and retaliation currently being intensified in South Vietnam seriously violate the Geneva Accords and increase the risk of renewed war. Such behavior must be resolutely stopped.
    People still remember how excited the entire population of Vietnam, Indochina, and all peace-loving people around the world were when the news of the signing of the Geneva Accords came out last July 21. They rejoiced at the restoration of peace in Vietnam and Indochina. However, the bellicose U.S. ruling clique and its agents in South Vietnam were not pleased with the Geneva Accords. From the day peace was restored, they conspired to undermine the Geneva Accords, transporting large quantities of military supplies into South Vietnam and stepping up war preparations. In August and October of last year, the ships "Ashmoula" and "Vietnam" unloaded many fighter engine and other war materials at the Saigon docks, including some tanks; in December of last year, the ships "Bobbyeyer" and "Feihe" transported three hundred boxes of armored vehicle engines and other war materials to Saigon; on January 12 of this year, the ship "Alandi" transported many combat supplies to Saigon, including aircraft parts in bulk; on March 10, the ship "Yelama" transported two hundred boxes of armored vehicle engines to South Vietnam; on March 15, 16, 17, and 19, many warships successively arrived in South Vietnam, carrying fighter parts, cars equipped with machine guns, and many other war materials; on March 25, a U.S. aircraft carrier sailed into Saigon, carrying nine communication planes, seven helicopters, and some jet engine parts; in May, the ships "Cambodia" and "Florit" transported many army and air force combat supplies to South Vietnam; in early July, another U.S. ship arrived in South Vietnam, carrying thirty (L)-19 reconnaissance aircraft, a new type of aircraft that can be converted into light bombers. These are all well-known facts. The International Supervisory and Control Commission's investigation report on the "Vietnam" and other ships illegally carrying combat materials to South Vietnam also clearly stated, "The Commission believes that this action is not in accordance with the spirit of Article 17 of the Geneva Accords." These ironclad facts are difficult for U.S. warmongers and the Ngo Dinh Diem group to cover up. In order to evade public criticism, U.S. warmongers and the Ngo Dinh Diem group are now playing a new trick, which is to transport combat materials to Cambodia first, and then carry them to South Vietnam along the Mekong River. This smuggling has been going on on a large scale since April of this year. This is the real reason why U.S. warmongers and the Ngo Dinh Diem group are firmly opposed to the International Supervisory and Control Commission inspecting the Mekong River shipping.
    In addition to shipping in combat materials by the shipload, U.S. warmongers are stepping up the equipment and training of Ngo Dinh Diem's army in South Vietnam, to be used as its war tool. The U.S. training delegation led by O'Daniel is very large in scale. This peculiar "delegation" not only has staff, planning, and logistics agencies, but also has special departments for security, intelligence, and operations. This "delegation" is not only responsible for training, but also controls all the organization, equipment, and command powers of Ngo Dinh Diem's army. This "delegation" completed the first phase of expanding Ngo Dinh Diem's army at the end of July this year, establishing four heavily armed divisions in South Vietnam; the second phase began in August and is expected to expand Ngo Dinh Diem's army to ten divisions by July 1956. Not only that, but the Ngo Dinh Diem group is also preparing to form a military alliance with the other two running dogs of U.S. imperialism, Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. It is particularly noteworthy that U.S. warmongers are now advocating war in Ngo Dinh Diem's army. The "teaching materials" compiled under the direct guidance of U.S. military personnel repeatedly use the words "crossing the 17th parallel north" and "advancing north."
    While stepping up war preparations, the U.S. warmongering group and its followers are also engaging in military provocations. Since the cessation of hostilities, small armed forces of Ngo Dinh Diem belonging to the French Federation forces have constantly invaded the demilitarized zone near the provisional military demarcation line to rob and persecute the people there. Especially since the beginning of August this year, these provocative actions of invading the demilitarized zone have increased even more.
    In order to carry out war preparations, the Ngo Dinh Diem group, supported by U.S. warmongers, has been carrying out crazy terror and massacres against the people of South Vietnam. They not only retaliate against former resistance personnel in violation of the Geneva Accords, but also arbitrarily kill the old, weak, women, and children. This kind of terror is now being carried out under the guise of so-called "suppressing communism" and "anti-communism" and is increasing unabated. According to incomplete statistics, in the so-called "suppression of communism and anti-communism campaigns" launched by the Ngo Dinh Diem group, by the end of July, 482 people in South Vietnam had been killed, 692 had been injured, 9,100 had been arrested, and 149 had disappeared. In the year since the ceasefire, a total of 1,202 people in South Vietnam have been killed, 4,231 have been injured, 25,165 have been arrested, and 705 have disappeared. Many of these victims are women and children. Among the 92 people killed by the Ngo Dinh Diem group in Tan Lap Village and Tan Hiep Village in Guangzhi Province on July 9, there were 32 women and 31 children. Nguyen Thi Mieu, a teacher at Degzhi Girls' School in Saigon who was killed by Ngo Dinh Diem on July 11, was a mother of three children and four months pregnant.
    The terror and massacre of the people of South Vietnam is part of the U.S. warmongering group's determination to turn South Vietnam into its colony and military base and step up war preparation policies.
    Due to the implementation of the war policy by the U.S. warmongering group and its followers, the peace of Vietnam and Indochina has been seriously threatened. It should be pointed out that France also bears an unshirkable responsibility for this. The French government should not only passively announce its respect for the Geneva Accords, but must also take action to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords.

    在南越的战争准备和恐怖行为必须停止
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    九月十一日，越南民主共和国政府国防部举行记者招待会，宣布越南人民军总司令武元甲将军致送越南国际监督和监察委员会主席德赛的一份备忘录。这个备忘录列举了许多无可争辩的事实，提醒有关方面密切注意：目前正在越南南方加紧进行着的战争准备和恐怖报复行为，严重地违反了日内瓦协定，增加战争再起的危险。这种行为必须坚决加以制止。
    人们还记得：去年七月二十一日，当签订日内瓦协定的消息传出来的时候，整个越南、印度支那以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民是多么兴奋。他们为了越南和印度支那和平的恢复而欢欣鼓舞。可是好战的美国统治集团和它在南越的代理人是不欢喜日内瓦协定的。他们从恢复和平的那天起，就阴谋破坏日内瓦协定，把大批军事物资运进越南南方，加紧准备战争。去年八月和十月，“阿士坡拉摩”号和“越南”号轮船，把许多战斗机的发动机和其他战争物资卸到西贡的码头上，其中还有一些坦克车；去年十二月，“波比耶”和“菲河”号轮船，又把三百箱装甲车的发动机和其他战争物资运到西贡；今年一月十二日，轮船“阿兰第”号又载运许多作战物资到西贡，其中有散装的飞机各部件；三月十日，轮船“耶拉马”号载运二百箱装甲汽车的发动机到南越；三月十五、十六、十七、十九日，连续有许多战舰开抵南越，载运来战斗机的部件、装有机关枪的汽车和许多其他战争物资；三月二十五日，又有一艘美国航空母舰驶入西贡，运来九架通讯飞机、七架直升飞机和一部分喷气式飞机的发动机；五月，轮船“柬埔寨”号和“弗罗利特”号又把许多陆军和空军作战物资运到南越；七月初，又有一艘美国轮船开到南越，运来三十架（L）十九式侦察机，这是一种可改装成轻型轰炸机的新式飞机。这些都是尽人皆知的事实。在国际监督和监察委员会关于“越南”号等轮船违法载运作战物资到越南南方的调查报告中也写得明明白白，报告的结论说：“委员会认为这种行动是不符合于日内瓦协定第十七条的精神的。”这些铁证如山的事实，美国好战分子和吴庭艳集团是难以掩盖的。为了逃避舆论的指责，美国好战分子和吴庭艳集团现在正玩弄着一种新的遮眼法，就是把作战物资先运到柬埔寨，然后再顺着湄公河载运到南越。偷运的勾当从今年四月开始就已经大规模地进行着。这就是为什么美国好战分子和吴庭艳集团坚决反对国际监督和监察委员会检查湄公河航运的真正的原因。
    除了成船成船地运进作战物资外，美国好战分子正在越南南方加紧装备和训练吴庭艳的军队，以作为它的战争工具。以奥丹尼尔为首的美国训练代表团，规模非常庞大。这个奇特的“代表团”，不仅有参谋、计划、后勤等机构，而且还有治安、情报、作战等专设部门，这个“代表团”不仅负责训练，而且还掌握着吴庭艳军队一切编制、装备以及指挥的职权。这个“代表团”在今年七月底已完成了扩建吴庭艳军队的第一阶段，在南越建立了四个重装师；八月份起开始了第二阶段，预计在一九五六年七月以前把吴庭艳军队再扩大到十个师。不但这样，吴庭艳集团还在准备和美帝国主义的另两个走狗李承晚和蒋介石结成军事联盟。特别值得注意的是，美国好战分子现在正在吴庭艳军队中鼓吹战争。在美国军事人员直接指导下编印的“教材”中，一再出现着“越过北纬十七度线”、“北进”等字眼。
    美国好战集团和它的追随者在加紧准备战争的同时，并且进行军事挑衅。自停止敌对行动时起，属于法兰西联邦部队的吴庭艳小股武装不断地侵入临时军事分界线附近的非军事区抢劫和迫害那里的人民。特别是今年八月初以后，这种侵入非军事区的挑衅行动更增多了。
    为了执行战争的准备，在美国好战分子支持下的吴庭艳集团，不断向南越人民疯狂地进行恐怖残杀。它们不仅违反日内瓦协定对以前抗战人员进行报复，而且任意杀害老弱妇孺。这种恐怖行为，现在正在所谓“肃共”、“反共”的幌子下有增无已地进行着。据不完全的统计，在吴庭艳集团发动的所谓“肃共、反共战役”中，到七月底为止，越南南方人民就被杀死四百八十二人，被打伤六百九十二人，被捕九千一百多人，失踪一百四十九人。自从停战起的一年来，越南南方人民被杀死的共有一千二百零二人，被打伤四千二百三十一人，被捕二万五千一百六十五人，失踪七百零五人。这些被害者中间，有许多是妇女和儿童。今年七月九日在广治省新立村和新协村被吴庭艳集团杀死的九十二个人中，就有三十二名妇女、三十一名儿童。七月十一日，被吴庭艳杀害的西贡德智女校教员阮氏妙，是一位三个孩子和怀孕四个月的母亲。
    恐怖和残杀越南南方人民，是美国好战集团决意把越南南方变成它的殖民地和军事基地、加紧准备战争政策的一部分。
    由于美国好战集团和它的追随者的战争政策的推行，越南和印度支那的和平已受到严重的威胁。应该指出，法国对此也是负有不可推卸的责任的。法国政府不应只是消极地宣布尊重日内瓦协定，而且必须用行动来保证日内瓦协定的彻底实施。
