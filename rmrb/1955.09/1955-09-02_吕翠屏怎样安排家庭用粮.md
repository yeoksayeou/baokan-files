    Lü Cuiping is the family member of a staff member of the Wuhan Real Estate Management Bureau and lives on Shenyang Street, Wuhan City. She is a good housewife and an active member of the street work. This year, when Wuhan implemented the planned grain supply based on household verification, she listened to the mobilization report and assisted the grain work group in preparing. On the day the residents' verified and quantified grain purchase certificates were distributed to the neighborhood committee, after she delivered the grain purchase certificates to each household, she took out her own grain purchase certificate and looked at it: Her family, two people, one adult and one child, cooked at home, with a monthly quota of 36 catties. She couldn't help but be stunned: "No wonder some people were arguing that it wasn't enough. I am a family working woman, and the child is already eight years old. How can this be enough to eat?" She didn't make a fuss. In the evening, she and her husband carefully calculated the accounts under the lamp. The average monthly grain purchase of her family from April to September last year was 44 catties. Now it is 8 catties less per month. Maybe it won't be enough? She recalled that although the grain consumption was high last year, there was a lot of waste, such as often using glutinous rice to make koji wine, and a lot of grain was used for visiting relatives and friends. She remembered that the district staff mentioned the importance of saving grain for national construction, and she remembered that she used to work and earn little money in the old society, and she had to buy grain every day. The money for a "dou" of rice in the morning would not buy a "dou" of rice in the evening. Life was very hard. Now, the People's Government implements grain supply based on household verification to ensure that people have grain to eat at any time. Last year, during the three months of flood control in Wuhan, the flood rose to 29.73 meters, and the grain price remained stable. This series of thoughts strengthened her confidence and she decided to support the government's measures with practical actions.
    However, in the first month of the verified grain supply, her family was not used to using grain according to plan. Plus, her husband ate at home four times on Sundays, and by the end of the month, there was a shortage of two days' worth of grain, so she bought some steamed buns and noodles on the street to make up for it. Some residents said, "Your family doesn't have enough grain either!" When she heard this, her face turned red. She thought, "I am a resident group leader, what kind of role am I playing for the residents?" At this time, Lü Cuiping truly realized that to save grain, she must carefully arrange her life and come up with ways to save. In the past, she used to cook rice with coal briquettes, and there were often crusts at the bottom of the pot, and sometimes the rice was burnt, wasting grain. So she thought of improving the method of cooking rice. First, she dried the water in the rice on the coal briquette stove, then added some coal chunks, and then covered the fire vent with a piece of iron to suppress the fire. After simmering for another fifteen minutes, the rice was cooked. This ensured even heat, and the rice cooked was neither too soft nor too hard, and there was no crust at the bottom of the pot. She estimated that this could yield 10 percent more rice, and at the same time, she would burn 30 catties less of coal per month. When cooking, she paid attention to cooking as much as she needed to eat, and put a fixed amount of rice into the pot. She also paid attention to strengthening the education of her children on saving grain, and prevented the children from throwing away and wasting food. As a result of her efforts, the grain consumption in June was very different from that in May. Not only was there enough to eat for the whole month, but there was also a surplus of more than two catties of grain. At the beginning of July, she took the initiative to reduce one catty. After such an arrangement, not only did she save grain for the country every month, but her family's monthly expenses also decreased by more than two yuan, and she deposited the money she saved in the bank.
    Recently, after the State Council announced the Interim Measures for Rationing Grain Supply in Cities and Towns, she expressed that she would continue to do a good job in saving grain at home and resolutely support the government's grain policy.

    吕翠屏怎样安排家庭用粮
    力口
    吕翠屏是武汉市房地产管理局一个工作人员的家属，住在武汉市沈阳街。她是一个家庭好主妇，也是街道工作中的积极分子。今年武汉市实行按户核实计划供应粮食的时候，她听了动员报告，就协助粮食工作组进行准备工作。居民核实定量的购粮证发到居民委员会的那天，她送完各户的购粮证后，回家拿出自己的购粮证来看：她家一大一小两个人在家开伙，每月定量三十六斤，她不禁呆了一下：“怪不得刚才有人吵不够，我是个家庭劳动妇女，孩子已八岁，怎么够吃呢？”她没有声张，晚上同她爱人在灯光下仔细算了算账，她家去年四至九月的每月平均购粮数是四十四斤，现在每月少八斤，可能不够吧？她又回想一下，去年用粮虽多，但其中有不少浪费，如经常用糯米做伏汁酒，亲戚朋友来客用粮也不少。她想起区工作人员谈到节约粮食对国家建设的重要意义，想起自己过去在旧社会作工赚钱少，要每天买粮，早晨一斗米的钱，晚上就买不着一斗米了，生活很苦。现在，人民政府实行粮食按户核实供应，保证人民在任何时间都有粮食吃。去年武汉市防汛三个多月，洪水涨到二十九点七三公尺，粮价也始终稳定不动。这一连串的思索，使她坚定了信心，决定用实际行动拥护政府的措施。
    但是，粮食核实供应的第一个月，她家还不习惯按计划用粮，加上她爱人星期天在家里吃了四次，到月底就差两天的粮食，到街上买了点馒头、面条贴补。有些居民就说：“你家粮食也不够吃啦！”她一听这话，顿时脸就红了。她想：“自己是个居民组长，这样对居民起个什么作用呢？”这时，吕翠屏真正体会到要节约粮食就要认真安排好生活，想出节约的办法。过去她是烧煤球焖饭，时常有锅巴，有时还把饭烧焦了，浪费了粮食。她便想法改善煮饭方法，先在煤球炉子上把米里的水煮干，然后添上一些煤块，火口上再加盖一块铁，把火压住，再焖十五分钟，饭就熟了。这样保证了火力均匀，做出来的饭不软不硬，又没有锅巴，据她估计这样可多出饭百分之十，同时每月还少烧煤三十斤。做饭时她注意掌握吃多少做多少，量一定的米下锅。她还注意对孩子加强了节约粮食的教育，让孩子不要抛撒糟踏饭。她这样作的结果，六月份用粮同五月份比较就大不相同了，不但全月够吃，而且还余了两斤多粮食。七月初，她就主动要求减少了一斤。经过这样安排，不但每月为国家节约了粮食，而且她家每月的开支也减少了两元多，她把这省下的钱都储蓄到银行里了。
    最近国务院公布市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法后，她表示要继续做好家庭节约粮食工作，坚决拥护政府的粮食政策。
