Xinhua News Agency, September 4th. Many factories and enterprises in Beijing are paying attention to ensuring product quality, and using substitutes instead of grain as raw materials or auxiliary materials, saving a lot of grain for the country.

More than 800 public, joint public-private, and cooperative-run weaving factories have used water glass instead of flour for sizing yarn. Since June, more than 100,000 jin of flour have been saved. If this method is promoted in all weaving factories in the city, more than 1 million jin of flour can be saved in a year. The Liulihe Cement Plant and the Beijing Box-Making and Binding Production Cooperative use sodium silicate instead of paste to glue cement bags and corrugated paper, saving 22,000 jin of flour per month, and the seams dry quickly and the paper bags are strong.

A light-colored, fresh-tasting naturally brewed soy sauce has appeared on the Beijing market, which is made by more than 400 soy sauce factories after canceling the use of caramel coloring. Since its production, preliminary statistics show that 1.5 million jin of grain have been saved. Now, most of the soy sauce factories in the city have begun to use soybean cake and bran instead of flour and sorghum to make soy sauce. It is estimated that more than 2 million jin of grain can be saved this year. The employees of the state-owned Beijing Winery are actively preparing to use the sweet potatoes that will be harvested in the suburbs to replace grain to make white wine, and it is expected that 4.5 million jin of grain can be saved in the fourth quarter of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 4th. The mass movement to save grain launched in seven major cities in Zhejiang Province, including Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Jinhua, and Shaoxing, has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, since June and July, these seven cities have saved more than 8.9 million jin of grain after plugging loopholes in waste, which can feed 20,000 people for a year. Hangzhou City saved more than 3.4 million jin of rice from June to August 20.

The grain saving movement started with collective food units such as government agencies and factories. Many units have implemented a grain pre-budget and final accounting system to improve food management. Collective food units have generally promoted the selling meal system and steamed rice system. After 129 units in Jinhua City implemented the selling meal system and steamed rice system, they saved more than 18,700 jin of rice in ten days. After more than 200 collective food units in Wenzhou City implemented the selling meal system, they can save more than 1 million jin of grain for the country throughout the year.

Saving grain has become a social trend among the general public. After 120,000 households in Hangzhou City revised their grain consumption plans, they can save more than 5 million jin of rice for the country throughout the year. The phenomenon of many residents feeding chickens with rice and making fried rice has disappeared. Many housewives have become active participants in the grain saving movement. Military family member and Glorious Mother Deng Xiaonai not only took the lead in revising her family's grain consumption plan, but also often introduced to her neighbors her experience of cooking three jin and twelve liang of rice from one jin of rice. Guo Xiulian, director of the Zhongxiao Road Residents Committee in Haitan District, Wenzhou City, has spread her experience of cooking three and a half jin of rice from one jin of rice in this residential area, and 60% of the residents have adopted this advanced cooking method.

Our newspaper reports that since Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, began to develop household grain consumption plans and verify grain consumption plans throughout the city in May, the city's grain sales have declined month by month. May decreased by 1.59% compared to April, June decreased by 4.48% compared to May, July decreased by 9.43% compared to June, and August decreased by 3.85% compared to July. In four months, the city saved a total of more than 2.879 million jin of grain, completing more than 57% of the annual target of saving 5 million jin of grain.

By early August, residents throughout the city had developed more realistic grain consumption plans, initially overcoming the behavior of buying more, hoarding, reselling, and transferring purchases, as well as the phenomenon of wasting grain by feeding pigs, chickens, and pigeons. All collective food units in the city have actively improved their management and implemented methods such as cooking according to the number of people and the amount of food, and using certificates to eat meals, which has greatly reduced the phenomenon of wasting grain. Public and private grain processing departments and grain storage departments have also saved a large amount of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 3rd. The 26 grain processing units under the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau have saved a lot of grain, expenses, and cloth for the country. In the first seven months of this year, these units saved more than 11.42 million jin of grain by increasing the flour yield of wheat and the rice yield of rice, and eliminating waste and spillage during processing and handling. Due to modifying machines, reducing power consumption, and using recovered old flour bags, the units saved more than 460,000 yuan in expenses from January to June and more than 39,000 bolts of cotton cloth.

In the first half of this year, after the province's grain processing units checked and criticized the tendency to blindly increase output and ignore quality and yield in grain processing, they generally strengthened planned management, unified operating methods, and strengthened the responsibility system, and at the same time conducted extensive education on saving grain among employees.

    北京杭州呼和浩特等城市节约了大量粮食
    新华社四日讯　北京市很多工厂企业在注意保证产品质量的情况下，采用代用品代替粮食做原料或辅助原料，给国家节省了大量粮食。
    八百多个公营、公私合营和合作社营的织布工厂，已用水玻璃代替面粉浆纱。六月份以来，已节省了十万多斤面粉。如果全市的织布工厂，都推广这个办法，一年就能节省面粉一百多万斤。琉璃河水泥厂和北京市制盒装订生产合作社，用矽酸钠代替浆糊粘贴水泥袋和瓦楞纸后，每月可以节省二万二千斤面粉，而且粘缝干得快，纸袋也结实。
    在北京市场上，出现的一种色泽浅、品味鲜的本色酱油，这是四百多个酱油工厂取消了色饴后制成的。自从生产以来，据初步统计，已经节省了一百五十万斤粮食。现在全市绝大部分酱油厂，又开始用豆饼、麸皮代替面粉、高粱制造酱油。估计在今年内，可以节省二百多万斤粮食。国营北京酿酒厂的职工们，正在积极准备利用郊区即将收获的白薯，来代替粮食制造白酒，预计今年第四季度可以节省四百五十万斤粮食。
    新华社杭州四日电　浙江省杭州、宁波、温州、嘉兴、湖州、金华、绍兴等七个主要城市展开的群众性的节约粮食运动，已取得很大成绩。据不完全统计，六、七两月份以来，这七个城市经堵塞浪费的漏洞后，节约了八百九十多万斤的粮食，这些粮食可供两万人吃一年。杭州市从六月到八月二十日止，就节约了大米三百四十多万斤。
    粮食节约运动首先是从机关、工厂等集体伙食单位开始的。很多单位都实行了粮食预决算制度，改善膳食管理。集体伙食单位普遍推行了卖饭制，蒸饭制。金华市一百二十九个单位实行卖饭制和蒸饭制后，在十天内就节约了一万八千七百多斤大米。温州市二百多个集体伙食单位实行卖饭制后，全年就可为国家节约一百多万斤粮食。
    在广大居民中节约粮食已形成一种社会风气。杭州市十二万户居民修订了用粮计划后，全年可为国家节约五百多万斤大米，过去很多居民拿大米喂鸡，炒米花等现象已经没有了。很多家庭妇女更成为节约粮食运动中的积极分子。军属光荣妈妈邓小奶不仅带头修订了自己的家庭用粮计划，而且经常向左邻右舍介绍自己一斤米煮出三斤十二两饭的经验。温州市海坦区忠孝路居民委员会主任郭秀莲一斤米煮三斤半饭的经验，已在这个居民区传开，有百分之六十的居民推行了这个先进煮饭法。
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区呼和浩特从五月开始在全市展开按户制定用粮计划和核实用粮计划工作以后，全市粮食销量逐月下降。五月份比四月份下降百分之一点五九，六月份比五月份下降百分之四点四八，七月份又比六月份下降百分之九点四三，八月份又比七月份下降百分之三点八五。四个月中，全市共节约了粮食二百八十七万九千多斤，完成全年节约粮食五百万斤任务的百分之五十七以上。
    到八月上旬，全市居民都已经订出较切实际的用粮计划，初步克服了多买、囤积、套购、转卖的行为及用粮喂猪、喂鸡、喂鸽子等浪费粮食的现象。全市各集体伙食单位都积极改善了经营管理，实行了按人按量做饭，凭证用膳等办法，大大减少了浪费粮食的现象。公、私营粮食加工部门和粮食保管部门也节约了大批粮食。
    新华社济南三日电　山东省粮食厅所属二十六个粮食加工单位，为国家节约了很多粮食、费用和用布。今年头七个月，这些单位由于提高了小麦出粉率和稻谷出米率，杜绝加工、搬运过程中的浪费和丢撒等，共节约粮食一千一百四十二万多斤。各单位由于改装机器，减少耗电量，利用收回的旧面袋等，一月到六月节约费用四十六万多元，节约棉布三万九千多匹。
    今年上半年，全省各粮食加工单位检查和批判了粮食加工中盲目提高产量、忽视质量和出品率的偏向后，普遍加强了计划管理，统一了操作方法和加强了责任制，同时在职工中广泛进行了节约粮食的教育。
