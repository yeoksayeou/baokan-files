Urumqi, September 18 (By our reporter)

    The people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi are greeting the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with new production achievements.

    More than ten factories and mines throughout the city have launched labor emulation drives. The Xinjiang Machine Factory, which started its competition in early August, has already overfulfilled its August production plan by 5.66%. Now, workers of all ethnic groups are painting new products such as double-wheeled double-share plows and No. 5 plows, which will soon be transported to the countryside, as a gift to greet the establishment of the Autonomous Region. To welcome the establishment of the Autonomous Region, designers at the printing and dyeing workshop of the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory are designing a large peony flower pattern. The workers of the newly built Ulabai Hydroelectric Power Plant are stepping up the inspection of machinery and the installation of transformers, preparing to test the power on September 20 and officially transmit electricity to Urumqi on October 1, the day the Autonomous Region is established. Utilizing their spare time, one hundred and fifty young workers from the Xinjiang Provincial Transportation Bureau have collected a large number of scattered old parts, striving to assemble a truck, a car engine, thirty-five jacks, and thirty batteries before the establishment of the Autonomous Region.

    These days, the labor emulation drives at dozens of construction sites in the city have reached a climax. Workers are striving to complete a batch of buildings before the eve of the establishment of the Autonomous Region. A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has designated September as a "Gift Month" to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and each unit has formulated a gift plan. The soldiers who are building the People's Theater in front of the Nanguan Street Heart Garden have devised a method to erect the steel roof frame of the main hall, which can accommodate 1,200 spectators, five days ahead of schedule. The five-person bricklaying team led by Cao Yaofeng, a special-class labor model of the Xinjiang Military Region, set a new record of laying 23,000 bricks per day when building the stage on September 6, exceeding the quota by more than double.

    The Tianshan Agricultural Production Cooperative on the outskirts of Urumqi recently held a forum, where members of all ethnic groups expressed their determination to greet the establishment of the Autonomous Region with practical actions of increased production. To welcome the establishment of the Autonomous Region, the farmers of Xiaoxigou Village in the Seventh District on the outskirts of the city have expressed their determination to do a good job in sowing winter wheat throughout the village, and the two mutual aid teams in the village have also proposed to strive for early transformation into agricultural production cooperatives.

    用生产成绩迎接新疆维吾尔自治区的成立
    乌鲁木齐各族人民开展劳动竞赛
    本报讯　乌鲁木齐市各族劳动人民正以新的生产成绩迎接新疆维吾尔自治区成立。
    全市十多个厂矿都开展了劳动竞赛。在八月初就展开竞赛的新疆机器厂，已超额完成八月份生产计划百分之五点六六，现在各族工人正在油漆即将运到农村去的双轮双铧犁和五号犁等新产品，作为迎接自治区成立的献礼。新疆七一棉纺织厂印染场为迎接自治区的成立，设计人员正在设计一种大牡丹花图案。新建的乌拉拜水力发电厂的职工们正在加紧检查机器和安装变压器，准备在九月二十日试电，十月一日自治区成立时正式向乌鲁木齐输电。新疆省运输局一百五十名青年工人利用工余时间搜集了大批零散旧件，争取在自治区成立前装配好一辆卡车、一个汽车引擎、三十五个千斤顶和三十个电瓶。
    这几天，市区的几十个建筑工地的劳动竞赛进入了高潮。工人们要在自治区成立前夕，建成一批建筑物。中国人民解放军某部把九月份作为向新疆维吾尔自治区的献礼月，各个单位都订出了献礼计划。正在南关街心花园前面修建人民剧院的战士，已研究出了把容纳一千二百名观众的正厅钢屋架提前五天竖立起来的办法。新疆军区特等劳动模范曹耀逢领导的五人砌砖小组，在九月六日砌舞台时创造了日砌两万三千块砖的新纪录，超过定额一倍多。
    乌鲁木齐市郊的天山农业生产合作社，最近举行了座谈会，各族社员表示要以增加生产的实际行动迎接自治区的成立。市郊七区小西沟村的农民为迎接自治区成立，表示要作好全村的冬麦播种工作，村中的两个互助组还提出争取提前转为农业生产合作社。
