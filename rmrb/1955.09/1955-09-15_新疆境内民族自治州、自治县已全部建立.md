All ethnic autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties have been established in Xinjiang. The autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties established in the province include the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture, the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and the Chabuchar Xibe Autonomous County, the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, the Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, the Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County, the Hoboksar Mongol Autonomous County, and the Mori Kazakh Autonomous County.

Since the establishment of these autonomous prefectures and counties, their connection with the local people has become closer than before, and problems are solved more promptly. The People's Committee of the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture received more than 560 letters from people of all ethnic groups reflecting opinions on improving agricultural and pastoral production within half a year. Herdsmen on the grasslands of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture came to the People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture from places five or six days away to report situations. In the past, Kirghiz herdsmen living on the Pamir Plateau often had disputes with some Uyghur farmers in the nine neighboring counties, such as Shule and Shufu, over issues such as livestock herding and pastureland. After the establishment of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture, the People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture, together with the relevant counties, invited the parties involved to negotiate together and quickly resolved this dispute that had not been resolved for many years. Now, 800,000 livestock from Uyghur farmers in these nine counties graze and are herded on the pastures of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture.

Since the establishment of the autonomous prefectures and counties, various construction undertakings have been rapidly developed. At present, the number of livestock in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has increased by 1.1 million compared to 1954, and the number of livestock in the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture has increased by 14.6 percent compared to 1954. The People's Committee of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture has formulated a plan to help more than 1,600 impoverished herding families in the prefecture to develop production and build homes, and has already begun specific work. This year, the autonomous prefectures and counties have established more than 440 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 11,000 farmers joining the cooperatives. A number of agricultural production cooperatives will be established soon. There has also been development in culture and education, with new primary schools, middle schools, cinemas, clubs, hospitals, cultural centers, and radio stations being established in various places. The Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, far away on the Pamir Plateau, has also built a new secondary school this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆境内民族自治州、自治县已全部建立
    新疆省境内各民族自治州、自治县已全部建立。全省建立的自治州、自治县计有伊犁哈萨克族自治州、博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州、克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州、巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州、昌吉回族自治州和察布查尔锡伯族自治县、塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县、焉耆回族自治县、巴里坤哈萨克族自治县、和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县、木垒哈萨克族自治县等。
    这些自治州、县建立起来以后，和本地人民群众的联系已比从前密切，解决问题也及时了。昌吉回族自治州人民委员会在半年内就接到各族人民反映改进农牧业生产的意见的信件五百六十多封。克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州草原上的牧人，有从要走五、六天路程以外的地方到自治州人民委员会来反映情况。生活在帕米尔高原上的柯尔克孜族牧民，过去因代牧牲畜和草场等问题，经常和疏勒、疏附等九个邻县的一部分维吾尔族农民发生纠纷。克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州建立后，自治州人民委员会便会同有关的县，邀请双方当事人在一起协商，很快就解决了这一件多年没有解决的纠纷。现在，这九个县的维吾尔族农民，有八十万头牲畜在克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州的草场上放牧和代牧着。
    各自治州、县成立后，各项建设事业得到迅速发展。目前，伊犁哈萨克族自治州的各种牲畜比一九五四年增加了一百一十万头，博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州的牲畜比一九五四年增加了百分之十四点六。克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州人民委员会订出帮助全州一千六百多户贫苦牧民生产建家的计划，并已着手进行具体工作。各自治州、县今年已建立了四百四十多个农业生产合作社，入社的农民达一万一千多户。不久，还要建立一批农业生产合作社。文化教育方面也有发展，各地都新建立了小学、中学、电影院、俱乐部、医院、文化馆和收音站等。远在帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县，今年也新建了一所中等学校。             （新华社）
