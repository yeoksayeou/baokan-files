The Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation held its opening ceremony for its performance tour in China at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing on the afternoon of the 28th. The performances by the Burmese artists were warmly welcomed by the Beijing audience, with nearly half of the programs being repeated once or twice.

A huge red banner hung in the Tianqiao Theater, with the words "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship" written on it in both Chinese and Burmese. When Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, and U Win, head of the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation, appeared on the stage together, the theater resounded with sustained applause. In his welcoming speech, Zheng Zhenduo pointed out that the performance of the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation in China will further deepen the Chinese people's love for the culture and art of the Burmese people, and at the same time will further enrich the cultural life of the Chinese people. He congratulated the Burmese artists on the success of their performance. In his reply, U Win emphasized the long-standing cultural ties and friendly relations between the people of China and Burma, and pointed out that the visit of the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation will further deepen the friendship between the people of China and Burma.

Those who attended the opening ceremony and watched the performance included Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, famous dancers, musicians, and writers from the capital, cultural figures who had visited Burma, young artists and students, as well as Burmese Ambassador U Hla Maw, diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China, totaling more than 1,500 people.

The song and dance performance began with a performance of Burmese national musical instruments. The Burmese National Orchestra, led by musician U Han Pa, played an overture. This piece of music, with its clear rhythm, beautiful melody and strong oriental flavor, was replayed twice after prolonged applause from the audience.

The songs "No War" and "Singing of Chairman Mao" sung by Burmese musicians were warmly welcomed by the audience. Fifteen Burmese singers, dressed in national costumes of China, Burma and other Asian countries, sang the song "No War", praising the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in the song, and singing the aspirations of the Asian people for peace and against war. "Singing of Chairman Mao," which was sung three times at the performance, was a song dedicated to Chairman Mao by the artists of the Burmese Cultural Delegation. It expressed the deep friendship of the Burmese people for the Chinese people and brought the congratulations of the Burmese people to the Chinese people.

Also performed at this performance were five Burmese dances with rich national characteristics and a dance duet. The "Burmese Long Drum Dance" is an extremely popular dance in Burmese folk culture. The dancers strike the drum with their palms and elbows, and their dance is simple and healthy. The "Royal Drum Dance" was performed by U Aung Min, Burma's most famous male dancer.

Programs that were warmly welcomed by the audience also included the Burmese harp and zither solos performed by U Ba Than, winner of the highest art medal of the Burmese Federation and general director of the delegation. Burmese artists also performed a dance from the Burmese classic play "Thit Moon Oak and the Dragon Princess", and a dance from the "Ramayana Story" which was introduced to Burma from India. The final program was the song and dance drama "We Unite", which explained in the form of a fable that unity is the power to overcome difficulties.

After the performance, a group of young artists presented flowers to the Burmese artists to pay their respects, and Zheng Zhenduo went on stage to shake hands with them to express his congratulations. Then, Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture, went backstage to congratulate them on the success of their performance. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached photo)
