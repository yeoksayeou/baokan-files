    New China's Workers' Sports Grand Review
    ——In Celebration of the First National Workers' Games
    He Long, Director of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China

    The First National Workers' Games is about to open. This sports event is the first grand review of workers' sports in New China since its establishment, marking a new stage in the development of sports in our country.

    The more than two thousand athletes participating in this sports event were selected through sports meets at all levels, from grassroots units and even workshops, within various industrial systems. A total of more than one million workers participated in various types of sports meets, forming a widespread upsurge of competition across the country. Prior to these selection competitions, many industrial systems successively established their own sports associations or sports association preparatory committees. They are not only the direct organizers of this series of selection competitions and this sports event, but the establishment of these sports organizations will promote the more extensive and organized development of workers' sports in the future.

    The large-scale development and infinitely broad prospects of sports among the working masses are inseparable from the establishment of New China, the working class becoming the masters of the country and enterprises, and the care of the Party and the state for the working people. Worker athletes are increasingly appearing in the ranks of outstanding athletes in New China and have developed into a strong force, especially many active participants in sports, who are also advanced figures in production. This situation can only be realized after the working class and other working people have seized power and taken their destiny into their own hands. In old China under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and in all capitalist countries, all this was unimaginable. In the capitalist world, especially in imperialist countries under the militarization of the national economy, even the minimum living conditions of the working class are deprived, and even air and sunshine become luxuries for the working people. It is even more impossible to carry out sports among the working masses.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have always regarded "developing sports and strengthening the people's physique" as a cause related to the vital interests of the working people. In our country's socialist construction, not only does the working class need a high degree of class consciousness, but also a strong body. Therefore, the Party Central Committee proposed in its January 1954 instruction on strengthening the people's sports work: "Improving the people's health and strengthening the people's physique is an important political task of the Party." Sports is an important factor in ensuring the completion of the country's first Five-Year Plan and one of the important means of carrying out communist education for the working people.

    The Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, has stipulated the tasks of sports in our country: to serve production and national defense. It has adopted the policy of "combining with actual conditions to carry out mass sports activities and gradually popularizing and regularizing them," and requires that they be effectively carried out first in factories, mines, schools, troops, and government agencies. The gradual establishment of sports associations in various industrial systems, so that sports activities in factories, mines, and enterprises are conducted with leadership and organization, is one of the important measures to implement this policy. This is an important lesson learned from the Soviet Union, and it is hoped that trade unions in various industries will effectively lead the sports associations in their respective systems and create their own experiences.

    After the establishment of sports associations and on the basis of the development of workers' sports, conditions should be actively created to prepare for the implementation of the "Prepared for Labor and Defense" sports system in factories, mines, and enterprises. Now, we have begun to implement this system in secondary schools and above and in the People's Liberation Army, and the effect is very good and very popular. After this system is implemented in factories, mines, and enterprises, leading the work of the "Labor and Defense System" will become a regular task of the sports associations. Of course, various sports activities should also be carried out according to the different characteristics of different industries and the different hobbies of different objects.

    In order to meet the needs of the extensive development of workers' sports, trade union organizations and sports associations at all levels are faced with an urgent task, namely, to cultivate a large number of cadres. Not only should leading cadres be trained, but especially technical instructors and coaches, otherwise, the enthusiasm of the masses will be difficult to consolidate, and sports skills cannot be improved. The main method of training cadres is short-term or amateur training. Sports committees and youth league organizations at all levels should actively assist in this work; administrative leaders and party organizations in various units should especially supervise and vigorously support this work.

    The development of workers' sports provides a reliable source for strengthening our country's athlete ranks. All units must fully attach importance to supporting the growth of new forces, pay attention to discovering and cultivating outstanding athletes and sports teams of their own from the working class. Only when new forces grow up will the transformation of old sports workers and athletes be more effective, will it be possible to break with conservatism and create new records. In addition to strengthening guidance and training for outstanding new athletes and sports teams in a planned way, more competitions should be held and more international competitions should be participated in to enrich their experience, improve sports skills, and attract more people to participate in sports.

    Resolutely and unconditionally strengthening the leadership of the Party is of decisive significance for ensuring the healthy development of sports. The experience of the past few years has proved that, due to the weak leadership of the Party in the sports team, the rampant spread of bourgeois ideology, and the complex composition of personnel, the development of sports in our country has been greatly restricted and seriously damaged. If we do not pay attention to strengthening political and ideological work, do not criticize bourgeois ideology, do not overcome championshipism, conservatism, and complacency, and do not thoroughly transform the sports team, it will be impossible for sports in our country to move forward better.

    Under the leadership of the Party, strive to learn from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, develop sports, so as to enhance the physical fitness of the working class and all working people in our country, and strive to successfully complete the first Five-Year Plan!

    新中国工人体育运动大检阅
    ——为全国第一届工人体育运动大会作
    中华人民共和国体育运动委员会主任  贺龙
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会即将开幕了。这次运动大会，是新中国建立以来工人体育运动的第一次大检阅，它标志着我国体育运动发展的新阶段。
    参加这次运动大会的两千多名运动员，是经过各产业系统从基层单位、甚至从车间，自下而上的各级运动会中选拔出来的。共有一百多万职工分别参加了各种类型的运动会，在全国形成了一个广泛的竞赛热潮。在这些选拔竞赛之前，许多产业系统相继建立了自己的体育协会或体育协会筹备会，他们不仅是这一系列的选拔竞赛和这次运动大会的直接组织者，而且这些体育组织的建立，将推动今后的工人体育运动更广泛、更有组织地发展。
    体育运动在工人群众中得到这样规模浩大的发展和无限广阔的前途，是同新中国的建立、工人阶级成为国家和企业的主人以及党和国家对劳动人民的关怀所分不开的。工人运动员日渐出现在新中国优秀运动家的行列中，并已经发展成为一支雄壮的队伍，特别是其中许多体育运动的积极参加者，同时也是生产中的先进人物。只有工人阶级和其他劳动人民一起掌握了政权，把自己的命运掌握在自己的手里以后，这种情况才能实现。在国民党反动统治下的旧中国，在所有的资本主义国家里，这一切都是难以想像的。在资本主义世界，尤其在帝国主义国家国民经济军事化的情况下，工人阶级最低限度的生活条件都被剥夺了，连空气和阳光都成为劳动人民的奢侈品，在工人群众中开展体育运动就更谈不上了。
    中国共产党中央和毛主席一向把“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，看作是一项有关劳动人民切身利益的事业。在我国进行社会主义建设当中，不仅需要工人阶级有高度的阶级觉悟，而且需要有强壮的身体，所以党中央在一九五四年一月关于加强人民体育运动工作的指示中提出：“改善人民的健康状况，增强人民体质，是党的一项重要政治任务。”体育运动是保证完成国家第一个五年计划的重要因素和向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一。
    中华人民共和国体育运动委员会根据党中央和国务院的指示，规定了我国体育运动的任务：为生产和国防服务。采取了“结合实际情况开展群众性的体育运动，并逐步地使之普及和经常化”的方针，并且要求首先在厂矿、学校、部队和机关中切实地开展起来。在各个产业系统逐步地建立体育协会，使厂矿、企业中的体育活动有领导地有组织地进行，就是贯彻这个方针的重要措施之一。这是向苏联学习的一条重要经验，希望各产业工会切实领导本系统的体育协会，创造出自己的经验来。
    在体育协会建立之后，在工人体育运动开展的基础上，就应当积极创造条件，准备在厂矿企业中推行“准备劳动与卫国”的体育制度。现在，我们已经在中等以上学校和人民解放军部队中开始推行了这种制度，效果很好，很受欢迎。这种制度在厂矿企业推行以后，领导“劳卫制”工作，就成了体育协会的一项经常的任务了。当然，还应当根据不同产业的不同特点和不同对象的不同爱好，开展多种多样的体育活动。
    为了适应工人体育运动广泛开展的需要，各级工会组织和体育协会面临着一项迫切的任务，即大量地培养干部。不仅要培养领导干部，尤其要培养技术指导和教练人员，否则，群众的积极性就很难巩固，运动技术也无法提高。培养干部的办法，主要是短期的或业余的训练。各级体委和青年团的组织，都应当积极地协助这一工作；各单位行政领导和党组织对于这一工作，尤其要加以监督和大力支持。
    工人体育运动的开展，为壮大我国运动员队伍提供了可靠的源泉，各单位都要充分地重视扶持新生力量的成长，注意发现和培养工人阶级自己的优秀运动员和优秀运动队。只有新的力量生长起来，改造旧的体育工作者和运动员才会更有成效，才能打破保守主义，创造新的纪录。对新生的优秀运动员和运动队，除了有计划地加强指导和训练之外，要多举行比赛，多参加国际竞赛，以丰富自己的经验，提高运动技术，并且吸引更多的人参加体育运动。
    坚决地无条件地加强党的领导，对保证体育运动健康地发展有着决定的意义。几年来的经验证明，由于体育队伍中党的领导薄弱，资产阶级思想自由泛滥，人员也很复杂，大大限制了、并且严重损害了我国体育事业的发展。如果再不注意加强政治思想工作，再不批判资产阶级思想，再不克服锦标主义、保守主义和骄傲自满情绪，再不把体育队伍进行一番彻底的改造，我国的体育运动就不可能更好地前进。
    在党的领导下，努力向苏联和各兄弟国家学习，发展体育事业，以增强我国工人阶级和全体劳动人民的体质，为胜利地完成第一个五年计划而奋斗！
