Reader's Letters Column:

    Following the publication of a letter criticizing the poor quality of Xin Zhongguo brand handcart tires in the "Reader's Letters Column" on June 6th, the Rubber Industry Administration of the Ministry of Light Industry, together with relevant departments, investigated the matter and has made appropriate compensation to the Yellow River harnessing workers for the losses they suffered due to the use of these tires. The newly designed heavy-duty tires from the Third Branch of the Qingdao No. 2 Rubber Factory (state-owned) are already in use at the Yellow River harnessing site, and the workers have given them good feedback.
    
    The Committee of the Chinese Nonferrous Metals Structure Engineering Company wrote: The criticism of us by Comrade Guan Qiuxi published in the "Reader's Letters Column" on July 17th is correct. We held a Party committee meeting to earnestly examine our unenthusiastic attitude towards criticism from newspapers and the masses, review the shortcomings in all aspects of our past work, and are determined to correct past mistakes through the struggle to practice strict economy and oppose waste.
    
  The Industrial Education Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry wrote to accept the criticism in the "Reader's Letters Column" on July 10th. In addition to reviewing the erroneous practice of "eating up school establishment quotas," the letter also explained the handling of the translation group and the distribution group.
    
    The First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Wuxi County, Sichuan Province, wrote: The content of the letter "A Sniff Reveals a Mistake," published in the "Reader's Letters Column" on June 12th, is completely true. Our staff member Chen Zhongbao has always been irresponsible in his work, and this time he adulterated tung oil with sesame oil for sale; we have given him the punishment he deserves.
    
    The "Reader's Letters Column" on July 17th criticized the irresponsible management of new-style farm implements by the Liyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lintong County. The Lintong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has written to accept the criticism and expressed its determination to improve its work.
    
    The "Reader's Letters Column" successively criticized the phenomenon of food waste in certain units on August 7th, 15th, and 21st. Now, the General Office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the General Office of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Dongdan District Health Clinic of Beijing, the Beijing Dairy Farm of the State-run Farm, the General Bureau of Electric Power Management of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Beijing No. 26 Middle School, and the Beijing No. 5 Construction Engineering Company have written to express their acceptance of the criticism and are actively seeking ways to stop the waste of food.
