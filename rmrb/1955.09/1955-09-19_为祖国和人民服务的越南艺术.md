Vietnamese Art Serving the Motherland and the People
Ma Hanbing, Director of the Editorial and Publishing Department of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

On the eve of our Sixth National Day, the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe has arrived in Beijing and will be touring several major cities in our country. Seeing these cultural envoys from the heroic nation, we are all filled with joy. We have the opportunity to see their artistic performances, and through these song and dance programs, we see the heroic face of the Vietnamese people, and how they have contributed their strength to the liberation of their motherland and the construction of their country, and to human peace.

In the difficult days of the war, the Vietnamese literary and artistic workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the motherland, endured all hardships, marched with their troops, used their literary and artistic weapons to expose the enemy's monstrous crimes, praised the deeds of the heroic soldiers, and encouraged the troops and the people. Day and night, regardless of fatigue, they set up propaganda sheds everywhere on the hills and plains, and performed countless times for the soldiers. They also took advantage of breaks in combat to wash clothes for the soldiers and help the troops transport the wounded and ammunition. This is how the Vietnamese literary and artistic workers served the motherland and the people with utmost loyalty.

Precisely because they infinitely love the motherland and the people, love their Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, and love their heroic troops, their literary and artistic creations fully express this noble ideology and emotion. The song "Pulling the Cannon Song" describes the heroic deeds of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu: One quiet night, a team of brave people's artillerymen pulled the cannons up the hillside in order to attack the enemy. The mountain was so high, the slope so steep, and time was very urgent, but the soldiers disregarded all difficulties, some pulling the cannons, some pushing the cannons, and pulled the cannons up the mountain. At this time, dawn arrived, and people faced the morning glow, welcoming victory. The song is majestic and powerful, just as the lyrics say: "Although the slope is high, our determination is higher than the mountain, although the valley is deep, it is not as deep as our hatred." It fully expresses the soldiers' strong will and invincible power. The end of the song turns to a joyful and encouraging mood, reminding people of the scene of victory in sight. If one had not gone deep into the war to experience life, if one did not deeply understand the spiritual outlook of the people's soldiers, it would not be possible to write such a song. This is not an ordinary song; it encourages people to fight. In another song, "Great Victory of Dien Bien Phu," it is full of a high degree of revolutionary heroism and optimism, full of passionate fighting spirit. The lyrics say: "Opening mountains and building roads, building bridges, we are advancing on the road to victory." Yes, the Vietnamese people are advancing on the road to victory; they have not only defeated the invaders but are also carrying out huge economic construction. The "Bamboo Grove Carnival Dance" expresses the joyful mood of the Vietnamese army and people after the victory. This is a folk dance of the Muong (minority) people of Vietnam celebrating the harvest after returning from hunting. It has been adapted by the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Vietnamese People's Army to express a collective dance of celebration by the broad masses of soldiers and civilians after defeating the enemy. This dance is relaxed and happy, and the actors cross each bamboo pole and coordinate with the rhythm of the sound of the bamboo poles being struck, which requires skillful dance techniques.

The Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe not only performed new songs and dances but also performed folk songs and folk instrumental music. These folk songs express the Vietnamese people's love for their land and their love for peace. "Spring Outing" is a folk song widely circulated in northern Vietnam, depicting the scene of the Vietnamese people working hard and reaping a good harvest. During the harvest season, young men and women share their labor fruits and encourage each other to work hard. Even the elderly follow this group of young people to dance. What a moving scene! In terms of musical melody, Vietnamese folk songs are very beautiful, kind, smooth, and moving. They make you feel as if you see the beautiful mountains and rivers of Vietnam, the rich land of Vietnam, and the warm and hospitable people of Vietnam.

Thank you to the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe for bringing us extremely rich programs and the sincere friendship of the Vietnamese people. Let us wish them success in their performances throughout our country! (Attached picture)

    为祖国和人民服务的越南艺术
    中国人民解放军总政治部文化部编审出版处处长　马寒冰
    在我们第六届国庆节的前夕，越南人民歌舞团来到了北京，并将在我国几个主要城市进行访问演出。看到了这些来自英雄国家的文化使节，我们每个人都充满了喜悦的心情。我们有机会看到他们的艺术表演，并通过这些歌舞节目，看到了越南人民的英雄面貌，看到他们怎样地为解放祖国和建设祖国、为人类和平贡献了自己的力量。
    在艰苦的战争日子里，越南的文艺工作者们，热烈地响应了祖国的号召，忍受着一切困难，随着自己的部队进军，用自己的文艺武器，揭穿了敌人的滔天罪行，歌颂了英雄战士们的事迹，鼓舞了部队和人民。他们不分昼夜，不顾疲劳地在山岗和平原上到处搭起鼓动棚，为战士们进行了无数次的演出。他们还利用战斗空隙，为战士们洗衣服；帮助部队转运伤员和弹药。越南的文艺工作者们就是这样忠心耿耿地为祖国和人民服务。
    正因为他们无限热爱祖国和人民，热爱自己的劳动党和胡志明主席，热爱自己的英雄部队，所以在他们的文艺创作中，充分表现了这种高尚的思想感情。歌曲“拉炮歌”描写了越南人民军在奠边府战斗中的英雄事迹：一个寂静的夜晚，一队英勇的人民炮兵，把大炮拉到山坡上，以便向敌人进行攻击。山是那么高，山坡那样陡险，时间又非常急迫，但是，战士们不顾一切困难，拉炮的拉炮，推炮的推炮，把大炮拉上山去了。这时黎明到来了，人们面临着朝霞，迎接着胜利。歌曲雄壮有力，正如歌词中所写的：“尽管山坡高高，我们的决心比山还要高，尽管山谷深深，不及我们的仇恨深。”充分地表达了战士们坚强的意志和不可战胜的力量。歌曲的结尾又转入欢欣鼓舞的情调，使人们联想到胜利在望的情景。如果不是深入战争中去体验生活，如果不是深刻地了解人民战士的精神面貌，是不可能写出这样的歌曲来的。这不是一支普通歌曲，它鼓舞着人们去进行斗争。在另一支歌曲“奠边府大捷”中，则充满了高度的革命英雄主义和乐观主义的精神，充满了饱满的战斗情绪。歌词上说：“开山筑路架起桥梁，我们行进在胜利的道路上。”是的，越南人民正在胜利的道路上前进，他们不但战胜了侵略者，并且进行着巨大的经济建设。“竹丛联欢舞”表现了越南军民在胜利后的欢欣情绪，这是越南芒族（少数民族）人民每当狩猎回来后庆祝丰收的民间舞蹈，经过越南人民军总政治部文工团的改编，把它用来表现广大军民在打败敌人后联欢庆祝的集体舞蹈。这个舞蹈轻松愉快，演员们越过每根竹竿，并和敲打竹竿声音节奏相配合，这就需要熟练的舞蹈技巧。
    越南人民歌舞团不但表演了新的歌曲和舞蹈，也表演了民歌和民间器乐。这些民歌表达了越南人民热爱自己土地、热爱和平的感情。“春游”是一首广泛流传在越南北方的民歌，表现了越南人民辛勤耕作、获得丰收的情景。青年男女们在收割的季节里，一面分尝自己的劳动果实，一面互相激励努力生产，连上了年纪的人，也跟着这群小伙子跳起舞来，这是多么动人的场面！从音乐曲调来说，越南民歌是非常优美、亲切、流畅和动人的，它使你仿佛看到越南的锦绣河山，看到越南富饶的土地，看到越南热情而好客的人民。
    感谢越南人民歌舞团给我们带来了极其丰富的节目，带来了越南人民亲切的友谊。让我们预祝他们在我国各地演出中获得成功！（附图片）
