He first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Ministry of Coal Industry on the official commissioning of the Dongshan Vertical Shaft, and warmly welcomed and sincerely thanked the Soviet government delegation headed by Zablotsky for coming to China to participate in the handover ceremony of the Hegang Coal Mine Dongshan Vertical Shaft. He said that during the first Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet government assisted China in the construction of 27 coal mine enterprises, all of which were built with the latest technological achievements. At the end of the first Five-Year Plan and during the second Five-Year Plan, they will be put into production one after another and exert their full production capacity, which will play a very important role in the development of China's industry and the improvement of China's old coal mine appearance. The Dongshan Vertical Shaft is the first mechanized and automated new-type vertical shaft successfully built with Soviet assistance after the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine. Over the past few years, Soviet experts, led by Bogomolov, have shown great enthusiasm for work, and they have unreservedly helped us with their superb technology. All the workers who participated in the construction of the Dongshan Vertical Shaft, under the leadership of the Party and the government, learned from the advanced experience of Soviet well construction, and with the strong support of fraternal factories and mines, finally built a pair of modern vertical shafts. We express our sincere gratitude to them.

He congratulated the miners of Hegang Coal Mine on the handover of the Dongshan Vertical Shaft on behalf of the Soviet miners. He said that Chinese construction personnel did not have enough well-building experience in the past, but we are particularly pleased that they can complete this important task assigned by the state in a short period of time. We have seen the various roadways, factory buildings, and mechanical equipment installation projects of this new mine and are very satisfied. We Soviet miners are very excited to see the technical assistance given to the friendly Chinese people in the development of coal mines and to see your achievements. After the Dongshan Vertical Shaft is handed over to production, there will be a new glorious task for your employees, which is to quickly increase the daily output of this mine and reach the designed production capacity as soon as possible. Finally, on behalf of the Soviet miners, I wish you new and greater achievements in well construction and production.
