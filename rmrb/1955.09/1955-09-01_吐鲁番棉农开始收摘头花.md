Turpan County, Xinjiang's Uyghur and Hui cotton farmers are braving the intense heat of the Turpan Basin to begin harvesting the first bloom on more than 57,700 mu of cotton fields. According to the yield prediction of the first bloom, the cotton output of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams this year will increase by 10% compared to last year. The average yield per unit area of agricultural production cooperatives can reach 350 to 400 jin; the 40 mu of high-yield fields in the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Chengguan District are estimated to produce more than 700 jin per mu. The average yield of more than 3,000 mu of cotton in the Mutual Aid Township of the Fifth District can reach up to 350 jin, with a minimum of 300 jin.

The Turpan branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has established three central purchasing stations and seven mobile purchasing groups in the area, and is working hard to purchase new cotton. This year, it plans to purchase 35,000 dan (traditional Chinese unit of weight) of lint cotton. From the end of July to August 22, it has already purchased 85,000 jin of first bloom.

    吐鲁番棉农开始收摘头花
    新疆吐鲁番县的维吾尔、回族棉农，正冒着吐鲁番盆地的酷热，开始在五万七千七百多亩棉田中收摘头花。根据头花的产量预测，今年农业生产合作社和互助组的棉花产量，将比去年增加百分之十。农业生产合作社的平均单位面积产量可达到三百五十斤到四百斤；城关区红光农业生产合作社的四十亩丰产田，估计每亩可产七百斤以上。第五区互助乡的三千多亩棉花平均产量最高可达到三百五十斤、最低也能达到三百斤。
    中国花纱布公司吐鲁番支公司在当地建立的三个中心收购站和七个流动收购小组，正在紧张进行新棉收购工作，今年计划收购皮棉三万五千市担。从七月底到八月二十二日，已收购了头花八万五千斤。
