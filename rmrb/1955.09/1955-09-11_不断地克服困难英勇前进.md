In the new China, in a country led by the Communist Party, many things that are called miracles have appeared. The young Communist Party member Luo Muming improved and created more than ten kinds of tools even when he was almost blind. This is one of those miracles.

"Cannot be a Rice Worm"

Luo Muming is a fitter at the Shantou Municipal Local State-Owned Machinery Repair Factory.

In August 1952, when rushing to produce sprayers to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in crushing the American imperialists' germ warfare, Luo Muming was seriously injured in a calcium carbide explosion.

In order to cure his injuries, the Party sent him to a place with better medical conditions for treatment. In order to take care of his life, the administrative side also recruited his wife to work in the factory. All of this moved him deeply.

After more than a year of treatment, he recovered his health. However, his left eye was blind, and his right eye only had 20 to 30 percent of its vision left. Unable to see with his eyes, a large stone weighed on Luo Muming's heart.

Returning to the factory he had left for more than a year, he saw that the factory had expanded, production had increased, and many people had become labor models. An excited mood replaced his heavy heart. Luo Muming only rested for two days before asking to work.

Initially, he worked as a "translator" for the administrative section chief in the office (local workers spoke Chaozhou dialect, and the section chief spoke Mandarin). However, there was not much translation work, sometimes only a few sentences a day, which made him feel uncomfortable. Later, he helped answer the phone, but the phone didn't ring often either, and he still had a lot of free time. After working for six or seven days, he thought, this is equivalent to not working at all! Sitting around doing nothing, that won't do. What kind of work should he do? As a messenger, he couldn't see if bad people came in; as a librarian, he couldn't see the books clearly. After thinking about it, he was most familiar with making sprayers. He made up his mind to return to the workshop as a fitter.

He made a request to the administrative section chief, but the administrative section chief did not agree. How could he let a person who couldn't see with his eyes go to the workshop?

Luo Muming went to the factory director again. After talking about his work situation, the factory director told him: "There isn't much work, so just rest for a while." He replied: "I cannot be a rice worm." After careful consideration, the factory director agreed to his request and allowed him to return to the workshop to do manual labor and light work.

"Work like Paul"

As soon as he arrived at the workshop, heavy difficulties were placed in front of Luo Muming. When walking, he would accidentally bump into this and that, and sometimes his hands and feet would bleed; to find tools, he had to use his hands to feel for them, and if they fell to the ground, he couldn't find them even after feeling around for a long time; as for doing work, the difficulty was even greater. Originally, brushing the wooden handle of the oil-brushed sprayer gun was a simple task. However, it was not easy for Luo Muming to do. He would brush for a while, then hold it close to his right eye to look for a while, spending a lot of effort, but the result was still uneven brushing, and the three lines in the middle were not brushed. Once, he was drilling a hole in a piece of iron plate. Although he opened his eyes wide, he still couldn't see clearly, and either couldn't drill through, or drilled crookedly. He drilled three times in a row, sweating profusely from tension, but still couldn't drill well.

He was not afraid of inconvenience when walking, he could get up again if he fell; he endured the inconvenience of using his hands instead of eyes, anyway, he would get used to it slowly; but he was saddened by not being able to do his work well. He remembered that he had repaired machine guns in the guerrilla zone in the past, but now he couldn't even drill a hole. How could he be a worker like this?

When he got home, he didn't eat dinner, didn't pay attention to his wife, and covered his head to sleep. Lying in bed, he thought a lot, and the more he thought, the more unhappy he became, even thinking about death. After lying down for two days, his eyes became inflamed.

The Party branch secretary, the trade union chairman, the Youth League committee member, and the workers all came to see him, comforting and encouraging him. The Party branch secretary, in response to his pessimistic and disappointed emotions, solemnly and sincerely told him: "Have you forgotten the stories of Paul and Wu Yunduo? Paul was not only blind, but also suffered from paralysis, but he still tried every means to work for the Party until his heart stopped beating... You should learn from Paul." The stories of Paul and Wu Yunduo had been read to him by comrades in the hospital, and the branch secretary had also told him on the way back to the factory, each time arousing his infinite admiration. Now, hearing the branch secretary say it, he felt even more intimate. He thought, Paul and Wu Yunduo were blind, but they still did a lot of work for the Party, but I was discouraged when I encountered difficulties. Wasn't this letting down the Party's training of me? Thinking of this, Luo Muming felt very ashamed.

The branch secretary also reminded him to remember what his father, mother, and brother had sacrificed for. Luo Muming knew this very clearly: his brother was killed by the enemy who dug out his heart and liver because he joined the Red Army guerrilla; his father was shot by the enemy because he was doing revolution; his mother was killed by the enemy because she went up the mountain to find the Red Army. Whenever he thought of the deaths of his loved ones, Luo Muming hated the Kuomintang reactionaries. He suddenly realized: "If I continue like this, will I be worthy of my parents and brother who sacrificed for the revolution?"

The Party's education and care untied the knot in Luo Muming's mind and strengthened his determination to participate in production: "Although my eyes cannot see, my body is still healthy, and I want to work like Paul."

Embark on the Road of Creation

This time, Luo Muming wanted to use desperate work to fight against difficulties. For example, scraping the water bowl of the sprayer, he couldn't see clearly, and often scraped his hands, sometimes even breaking them. The comrades advised him not to scrape, but he wiped the blood off his hands with cotton yarn and continued to work stubbornly.

However, desperate work is not a good way after all, and besides, working like this still couldn't meet the quota.

Luo Muming knew that the administrative side did not criticize him for not meeting the quota because his eyes were not good; but he did not forgive himself for not meeting the quota because his eyes were not good. He often said: "If a person falls behind in labor, they will fall behind in other aspects as well." And he had never fallen behind in the past, and he didn't want to fall behind now either.

To not fall behind, he had to overcome the difficulty of not being able to see with his eyes. But where was the solution?

It was the Party that pointed out the way for him again. The Party's call to "tap potential and find tricks" shone like a lighthouse, illuminating his path forward.

During the day, the Youth League branch reported Wang Chonglun's advanced deeds at the conference, and he listened intently. In the evening, he took out the booklet introducing Wang Chonglun and asked his wife to read it to him sentence by sentence, until after twelve o'clock at night before going to bed. Saying he was sleeping, but how could he fall asleep? He tossed and turned, thinking: Wang Chonglun used his brain and completed more than four years of work in one year. My eyes are not good, so I should use my brain more to do my work well; if I can also improve and create tools, can't I reduce the difficulty of not being able to see with my eyes?

From then on, he began to think of ways to improve and create tools.

At that time, he was still scraping water bowls. He thought as he worked. As a result, he proposed a suggestion: to change the scraper to the same size as the water bowl. During operation, the scraper was installed on a small drilling machine, and the hand held the water bowl. When the scraper rotated, the water bowl was scraped smooth. The test results showed that 172 pieces were scraped in one hour and 45 minutes, which increased work efficiency by more than three times compared to ordinary workers using manual scraping.

The first victory and the encouragement from the Party and comrades brought infinite strength to Luo Muming. The Party sent his creation to the Workers' Cultural Palace for exhibition, and often taught him to guard against arrogance and impatience, and to rely on leaders and workers to solve difficulties. The workers also took the initiative and enthusiastically gave him help. He knew how to embark on a correct path: "Although my eyes cannot see, as long as I can use my brain and think of more ways, I can still work for the Party."

Overcoming One Difficulty After Another

Creation is not an easy thing in itself. For Luo Muming, who only has 20 to 30 percent of his vision, it is of course even more difficult. Although difficulties constantly entangled Luo Muming, Luo Muming was not overwhelmed by difficulties. On the contrary, he overcame difficulties, gained a foothold, and advanced step by step.

Luo Muming could only cut an average of 40 rubber tubes per hour, only 40 percent of the output of ordinary workers. Even for ordinary workers, cutting rubber tubes with a chisel is a laborious task. Therefore, Luo Muming was determined to improve the efficiency of cutting rubber tubes. He suggested to the workshop director to install a specially made knife on a small punching machine to cut rubber tubes mechanically. His suggestion was strongly supported by the trade union chairman. He set about drawing drawings. Unable to see with his eyes, how could he draw drawings? He made a small blackboard for himself, first drawing on the blackboard, and then asking others to trace it on paper. At night, relying on the 20 to 30 percent of his vision in his right eye, he drew stroke by stroke on the small blackboard, modifying it again and again. After four or five nights of staying up late, he finally broke through the first barrier and drew a simple sketch. With the emergence of the sketch, the blood vessels in his eyeballs increased a lot.

When the workers saw the drawings, they all said it would work. But Luo Muming thought: It would be difficult to manufacture such a machine; even if it was manufactured, the cost would be too high. What to do? He thought of using waste materials. One Sunday, he groped step by step towards the factory's scrap iron pile. When he arrived at the casting workshop, he accidentally fell into a pit, breaking his hands and feet. The workers pulled him up and advised him not to run around and to go home to rest; but he sat on the ground to rest for a while, then limped to the scrap iron pile. There, he groped piece by piece, and finally found a suitable thing - a small punching machine. Another barrier was broken through.

This machine also needed to be made with a specially made knife. The blacksmith had already made the knife, but it was not sharpened well. Sharpening a knife is not difficult for a worker with good eyes, but it is another matter for Luo Muming. Others sharpen knives by clamping the workpiece in the vise and using a file to file it. He couldn't see with his eyes, so he had to turn it over, clamping the file in the vise and holding the workpiece in his hand to file it. He filed while touching (to see if it was sharpened), sweating profusely, but he finally turned the blunt knife into a sharp knife.

In this way, Luo Muming overcame numerous difficulties and created a rubber tube cutting machine, increasing the work efficiency of the rubber tube cutting machine by two times.

After capturing one fortress, Luo Muming besieged another fortress. From July 1954 to January 1955, he improved and created a total of 16 tools and operating methods of various sizes. These creations were of various sizes, but no matter which creation, it contained Luo Muming's perseverance and extraordinary willpower. Creating the rubber tube cutting machine was like this, and creating the copper tube sawing machine was also like this. At first, he designed a circular saw blade driven by electricity, but because the saw blade was fixed, the copper tube could not be pulled over, and it failed. He then asked someone to help him convert an old grinding wheel into a hand-cranked copper tube sawing machine, but it was too bulky, and it was both laborious and slow to crank by hand, and it failed again. Luo Muming used Wang Chonglun's spirit of overcoming difficulties and creating a universal tool tire to encourage himself and continued to study hard. Finally, with the help of the workshop director, the copper tube sawing machine was successfully made.

In order to find tricks and do a good job in production, Luo Muming thought while sitting, thought while walking, paid attention during work hours, and did not relax during rest hours, even thinking while eating. Once, while eating, he suddenly picked up a pair of chopsticks, gesticulating and drawing, and then tilted his head, widened his right eye, and stared at the chopsticks in a daze. A female comrade next to him asked strangely: "Comrade Muming, why are you playing while eating?" He replied with a smile: "I'm not playing, I'm using my brain!" It turned out that he was thinking about improving the work of oil brush wooden handles, and used chopsticks as wooden handles. It was with such a spirit of hard work and research that he overcame difficulties. At the end of December 1954, he joined the Communist Party that cultivated him. He was also elected as a labor model. The Party's cultivation and the honor given to him by the people gave him greater courage and determination to overcome difficulties and engage in creative labor.

This March, after attending the Guangdong Provincial Labor Model Representative Conference of Industrial, Mining, Transportation, and Transportation Enterprises, with the help of the factory's "Rationalization Proposal Group," he created two more tools: one is a nozzle drilling machine, which increased the drilling of nozzles (parts of sprayers) from 520 per person per day in the past to 2,000; the other is a wooden handle assembling machine, which increased work efficiency by 50 percent and greatly reduced physical labor.

    不断地克服困难英勇前进
    司逸
    在新中国，在共产党领导的国家里，出现了许多被人们称为奇迹的事情。年轻的共产党员罗木命在眼睛近乎失明的情况下，改进和创造了十多种工具，就是这些奇迹中的一件。
    “不能做蛀米虫”
    罗木命是汕头市地方国营机械修配厂的钳工。
    一九五二年八月间，在赶制喷雾器、支援志愿军粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战时，因为电石爆炸，罗木命受了重伤。
    为了治好他的伤，党把他送到医疗条件较好的地方治疗。为了照顾他的生活，行政方面又吸收他的爱人进厂工作。这些，都使他深深感动。
    经过一年多的医治，他恢复了健康。但是左眼失明了，右眼也只剩下二、三成的视力。眼睛看不到，罗木命的心上压上了一块大石头。
    回到离开了一年多的工厂，看到工厂扩大了，生产提高了，很多人都成了劳动模范，兴奋的情绪代替了沉重的心情，罗木命只休息了两天，就要求工作。
    开始，他在办公室里给行政股长当“翻译”（当地工人讲潮州话，股长讲普通语）。但翻译的工作不多，有时一天只翻译几句话，闲得他难受。以后，他又帮着接电话，但电话也不常有，空闲的时间还是很多。干了六、七天，他想，这等于没做工作呀！坐着吃闲饭，那不行。做什么工作呢？做传达，坏人进来看不到；当图书管理员，又看不清书籍。想来想去，最熟悉的还是做喷雾器。他下定决心，要回车间当钳工去。
    向行政股长提出了要求，行政股长不答应。怎么能让一个眼睛看不到的人到车间去呢。
    罗木命又去找厂长。谈了工作情况，厂长告诉他：“事情不多，你就休息一下吧。”他回答：“我不能做蛀米虫”。厂长慎重考虑之后，答应了他的要求，允许他回车间做手工活和轻活。
    “要像保尔一样地工作”
    一到车间，重重的困难就摆在罗木命的面前。走动时，一不小心，就碰到这，碰到那，有时手脚也碰出了血；找工具，要用手摸，掉到地下，摸了半天也摸不到；干活，那困难就更不用说了。本来，油刷喷雾器喷枪的木柄，是一件简单的工作。但是，让罗木命做起来就不容易了。刷一阵，拿近右眼看一阵，费了很大力气，结果还是刷得不均匀，中间三道线还没刷到。有一次，他在一块铁板上钻孔。尽管他把眼睛睁得大大的，但是仍然看不清楚，不是钻不到，就是钻歪了，一连钻了三次，紧张得出了满身汗，还是没钻好。
    走路不方便，他不怕，跌倒了可以再爬起来；用手代替眼睛，不方便，他忍住了，反正慢慢会习惯的；但是工作做不好，却使他难过起来。他想起过去在游击区时，机枪都修理过，现在，却连钻孔也钻不了。这样，怎么当一个工人呢？
    回到家里，他饭也不吃，爱人也不理，蒙着头睡觉。躺在床上，他想了很多，越想越想不开，甚至想到死。躺了两天，眼睛发了炎。
    党支部书记、工会主席、团支部委员和工人们都来看他，安慰他，鼓励他。党支部书记针对他的悲观失望情绪，严肃地、诚恳地告诉他：“你忘记了保尔和吴运铎的故事吗？保尔不仅双目失明，而且得了瘫痪症，但是他还想尽各种办法来为党工作，直到心脏停止跳动为止……你应该向保尔学习。”保尔、吴运铎的故事，在医院里，同志们已念给他听过，在回工厂的旅途上，支部书记也讲过，每一次都引起他无限的敬佩。现在听支部书记一说，又更加使他感到亲切。他想，保尔和吴运铎眼睛失明了，还为党做了许多工作，我却碰到困难就灰心，这不是辜负了党对我的培养吗？想到这里，罗木命感到很惭愧。
    支部书记又提醒他，要记住自己的父、母、哥哥是为了什么而牺牲的。这，罗木命知道得清清楚楚：哥哥是因为参加红军游击队被敌人挖掉心肝死去的；爸爸是因为干革命被敌人枪杀的；妈妈是因为上山找红军被敌人打死的。一想起亲人们的死，罗木命恨透了国民党反动派。他猛省过来：“我这样下去，对得起为革命而牺牲的父母和哥哥吗？”
    党的教育和关心，解开了罗木命思想上的大结，坚定了他参加生产的决心：“我的眼睛虽然看不到，但身体还是健康的，我要像保尔一样地工作。”
    走上创造的道路
    这一回，罗木命想用拼命的工作来同困难搏斗。譬如刮喷雾器的水碗，他看不清，经常刮到手，有时手也刮破了。同志们劝他不要刮，但他用棉纱抹去手上的血，继续顽强地干下去。
    但是，拼命干毕竟不是好办法呀，何况这样干还不能达到定额呢。
    罗木命知道，行政方面为了照顾他的眼睛不好，达不到定额也不批评他；但是他没有因为眼睛不好，而原谅自己达不到定额。他常常说：“一个人在劳动上落后了，其他方面都会落后的。”而他，过去没落过后，现在也不愿意落后。
    要不落后，就得战胜眼睛看不到的困难。可是，办法在哪儿呢？
    又是党给他指出了道路。党提出的“挖潜力，找窍门”的号召，像灯塔一样给他照亮了前进的道路。
    白天，团支部在大会上报告了王崇伦的先进事迹，他听得入了神。晚上，他又拿出介绍王崇伦的小册子，叫他爱人一句一句地念给他听，一直到夜里十二点多才睡觉。说是睡觉，其实哪里睡得着呢。他翻来覆去的想：王崇伦开动脑筋，一年完成四年多的工作量。我的眼睛不好，更应该多开动脑筋，才能做好工作；如果我也能改进和创造工具，不就可以减少眼睛看不到的困难吗？
    从此，他就开始想办法改进和创造工具。
    那时候，他还是在刮水碗。他一边做，一边想，琢磨的结果，他提出一个建议：把刮刀改成像水碗那样大小，操作时，把刮刀安在小钻床上，手托着水碗，刮刀一转动，水碗就刮的光滑了。试验结果，一小时四十五分刮了一百七十二个，比一般工人用手工刮的提高工作效率三倍多。
    头一次的胜利，党和同志们的鼓励，给罗木命带来了无限的力量。党把他的创造送到工人文化宫去展览，并经常教导他戒骄戒躁，依靠领导和工人来解决困难。工人们也都主动地、热情地给他以帮助。他知道怎样走上一条正确的道路：“虽然我眼睛看不到，但只要能开动脑筋，多想办法，一样能为党工作。”
    战胜一个又一个的困难
    创造，本来就不是一件容易的事情，对于罗木命这样只有二、三成视力的人来说，当然就更为困难了。尽管困难时刻纠缠着罗木命，但是罗木命并没有给困难缠倒；相反地，他战胜了困难，站住了脚跟，一步一步地前进着。
    罗木命切橡胶管平均每小时只能切四十条，只及一般工人产量的百分之四十。就是对一般工人来说，用凿子来切橡胶管，也是一件吃力的工作。因此，罗木命决心要提高切橡胶管的效率。他向车间主任提出建议，在小冲床上安一把特制的刀，用机械来切橡胶管。他的建议，得到工会主席的大力支持。他就着手画图。眼睛看不到，怎样画图呢？他给自己做了一块小黑板，先画在黑板上，然后再请别人照着描在纸上。夜里，他凭着右眼的二、三成视力，在小黑板上一笔一笔地画，一次又一次地修改。熬了四、五个夜晚，终于突破头一道难关，画好了一个简单的草图。随着草图的产生，他眼球上的血丝增加了好多。
    工人们看了图样，都说行得通。但是罗木命想：要制造这样一个机器，可是一件难事；就是造出来，成本也太高。怎么办呢？他想到利用废料。一个星期天，他一步一步地摸索着走向厂里的废铁堆。到铸造车间，一不小心，掉下坑里，把手脚都碰破了。工人们把他拉上来，劝他不要乱跑，回家休息去；但是他坐在地上歇了一会儿，又拐着脚走到废铁堆。在那里，他一件件地摸索，终于找到了一件合用的东西——小冲床。又一道难关被突破了。
    这个机器上还需要造一把特制的刀。锻工已把刀打出来了，只是没有磨好。磨刀，在一个好眼睛的工人来说，并不困难，但对罗木命却是另一回事。别人磨刀，是把工作物夹在钳台口，用锉刀来锉。他眼睛看不到，只好反过来，把锉刀夹在钳台口，手把着工作物来磨。他一边磨，一边摸（看是否磨好了），磨出了一身汗，但他终于使钝刀变成了利刀。
    就这样，罗木命战胜了重重困难，创造了切橡胶管机，把切橡胶管机的工作效率提高了两倍。
    攻下了一个堡垒，罗木命又围攻另一个堡垒。从一九五四年七月到一九五五年一月，他一共改进和创造了大小十六种工具和操作法。这些创造有大有小，但是，不论哪一件创造，都包含着罗木命的坚韧非凡的毅力。创造切橡胶管机是这样，创造锯铜管机也是这样。开始，他设计出一个用电力带动的圆锯盘，但是，因为锯盘是固定的，铜管没法拉过来，失败了。他又找人帮忙利用旧砂轮改装成手摇的锯铜管机，但是太笨重，用手摇既费力又慢，又失败了。罗木命用王崇伦克服困难创造万能工具胎的精神来鼓励自己，继续刻苦钻研。终于，在车间主任的帮助下，做成功了锯铜管机。
    为了找窍门，搞好生产，罗木命坐着想，走着想，工作时间留意，休息时间也不放松，甚至吃饭时也想。有一次，正吃着饭，他忽然拿起一双筷子，比来划去，又侧着头，睁大着右眼，望着筷子出神。旁边一个女同志奇怪地问：“木命同志，你怎么边吃边玩啦？”他笑着回答：“我不是在玩，是在动脑筋哩！”原来他在想改进油刷木柄的工作，把筷子当做木柄了。他就是以这样苦心钻研的精神来战胜困难的。一九五四年十二月底，他加入了培育他成长的共产党。他还被选为劳动模范。党的培养和人民给他的荣誉，使他具有战胜困难从事创造性劳动的更大的勇气和决心。
    今年三月，参加了广东省工矿交通运输企业劳动模范代表大会后，在厂里的“合理化建议小组”的帮助下，他又创造了两件工具：一件是钻喷头机，使钻喷头（喷雾器的零件）由过去每人每天五百二十个提高到二千个；另一件是装木柄机，提高了工作效率百分之五十，还大大减轻了体力劳动。
