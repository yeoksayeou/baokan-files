Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The Japan Preparatory Committee for the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a Standing Committee meeting in Tokyo on August 23rd, and decided on the direction for further developing the movement in Japan to ban atomic weapons after the World Conference.

    Representatives from approximately forty mass organizations from all sectors of Japanese society attended the meeting. They first listened to a report by Yasui Kaoru, Secretary-General of the Japan Preparatory Committee, on the achievements of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. He pointed out that the World Conference had established close cooperative relationships between various mass organizations in different regions of Japan, strengthened the Japanese people's confidence in peace, and widely promoted the spirit of international solidarity.

    The meeting discussed and adopted Yasui Kaoru's report. The meeting decided that, based on the great unity of the people after the World Conference, a new national organization, tentatively named the "Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," would be established to further promote the movement to ban atomic weapons, strengthen cooperation with international organizations, and carry out movements to assist atomic bomb victims both domestically and internationally. The meeting requested the Japanese government and local governments to allocate funds in their budgets to assist atomic bomb victims.

    The meeting also decided to hold a general meeting of the Japan Preparatory Committee in early September, so that the general meeting could discuss and approve the above-mentioned policy decided by the Standing Committee.
