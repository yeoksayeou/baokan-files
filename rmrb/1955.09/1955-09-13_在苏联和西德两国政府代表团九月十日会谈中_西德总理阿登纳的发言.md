Adenauer's Speech at the September 10th Meeting of the Soviet and West German Government Delegations

Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers,

Before I let the Foreign Minister speak, please allow me to address a few issues from your speech and respond to them.

I welcome what you said: that you also believe all issues must be discussed with full sincerity. Yes, indeed. If, after everything that has happened, there is now a desire to re-establish normal relations, we must begin by frankly stating everything we feel in our hearts.

Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, in the beginning of your speech, you described the suffering endured by the Soviet people in the last great war. I honestly acknowledge that the Soviet people suffered greatly in that war. However, if you say that the situation of the German people was different, then I must venture to remind you: one must not confuse Hitler and his supporters with the German people. A large part of the German people also condemned Hitlerism in their hearts, and they condemned the entire war, especially the atrocities committed by Hitlerism. It can be said here that, in speaking of the German people, one must only regard them as an indivisible whole. However, Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, our task now is to reach an agreement with that part of the German people who have always, and still do, feel deep disgust for all these things.

You also said that some in Germany talk about "positions of strength." I think there is a great misunderstanding on this point.

No one in Germany would imagine that they could negotiate with the Soviet Union from a "position of strength." I think that in considering all these issues, one must take into account the general situation of the world and of Europe, and not just the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic. It should not be forgotten that our country is undefended and unguaranteed. The Federal Republic has been completely disarmed, is occupied, and is in an unstable state with the risk of conflict at any time. Small countries like the Federal Republic also need the opportunity to defend themselves, just as the German Democratic Republic has this need.

Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you also talked about the issue of prisoners of war. Allow me to clarify this: in my speech yesterday, I did not mention the words "prisoners of war" at all. I deliberately avoided using those words. If you study what I said more carefully, you will be able to see that I was talking about all "detained" people. You talk about "war criminals" and the judgments made by Soviet courts. We have similar facts in our relations with the United States, Britain, and France. However, it goes without saying that the judgments made by the courts of those countries shortly after the war were inevitably influenced by emotions and the atmosphere at the time, and even witnesses were affected by this; the entire atmosphere was not conducive to making judgments that could be made after calmly considering all the factual materials.

Conclusions have already been drawn from this, and amnesties have been used to reduce the unserved sentences of almost all those who were sentenced.

Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you must know that the London "Times" once wrote that it is said that in these talks our approach will be to some extent like that of ancient envoys, with each loudly pointing out to the other the shortcomings he wishes to overcome. I think that we should not do this, but must sincerely and through calm consideration try to reach a real agreement. German troops invaded Russia, that is true. Many bad things happened, that is true. But, the Russian army later repelled the invasion—I must of course admit this—and entered Germany, and then in Germany, many terrible things happened during the war, and that is also true. I think that if we hope to begin a new period in our relations, and this is our sincere desire, we must not indulge too deeply in the review of the past, because doing so we will only create obstacles in our path. A pure heart is also one of the prerequisites for starting a new period.

Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, I venture to point out one or two points in my speech yesterday. In my speech yesterday, I said that the German nation and its newly established country are unfortunately in a world characterized by the contradictions between the four major powers. I ask you to consider this: a considerable part of all our difficulties arises from the fact that the four victorious countries have diverged in the development of their policies. I think I fully, comprehensively, and clearly explained yesterday: that we also recognize the need to establish a European security system, and that we must also do our best to create a system that is sufficient to guarantee the security of all parties involved and truly prevent war.

If you allow me, I now ask the Federal Foreign Minister, Mr. Brentano, to speak.

### 在苏联和西德两国政府代表团九月十日会谈中  西德总理阿登纳的发言

    在苏联和西德两国政府代表团九月十日会谈中
    西德总理阿登纳的发言部长会议主席先生，
    在我让外交部长发言以前，请允许我谈谈你的发言中的几个问题并对它们作出答复。
    我欢迎你所说的话：你也认为必须怀着充分的诚意来讨论所有的问题。是的，的确是这样的。如果说，在发生过了一切事情之后现在毕竟有了一种再度建立正常关系的愿望，我们就必须以坦率说明我们心中所感到的一切作为开始。
    部长会议主席先生，你在你的发言的开始部分，叙述了苏联人民在上次大战中遭受的痛苦。我老实地承认，在这次战争中，苏联人民遭受了极大的痛苦。然而，如果你说德国人民的情况却有所不同，那我就要不揣冒昧提醒你注意：一定不能把希特勒和他的支持者同德国人民混为一谈。有很大一部分德国人民在内心也谴责希特勒主义，他们谴责整个这场战争，首先是希特勒主义所施的暴行。在这里可以这样说，在谈到德国人民时，必须只把他们当作是一个不可分割的整体。然而，部长会议主席先生，我们现在的任务是同过去一直、现在仍然对这一切事情感到深恶痛绝的这一部分德国人民达成协议。
    你还说，在德国有人谈“实力地位”。我认为在这一点上有着很大的误解。
    在德国，谁也不会想像可以从“实力地位”出发来同苏联进行谈判。我认为，在考虑这一切问题时，必须估计到全世界和欧洲的一般局势，而不是仅仅考虑苏联和联邦共和国的关系。不应该忘记我们的国家没有防御和没有得到保证的情况。联邦共和国已经完全解除武装、受到占领而且处于不稳定的、有随时发生冲突的危险的状态。像联邦共和国这样的小国也需要有机会来保卫它们自己，正如德意志民主共和国也有这种需要一样。
    部长会议主席先生，你还谈到战俘问题。请允许我说明这一点，在我昨天的发言中，根本没有提到“战俘”这个字眼。我有意避免用这个字眼。如果对我所说的话比较注意地加以研究的话，你将能够看到，我所说的是所有“被监禁”的人。你谈到“战犯”和苏联法院作出的判决。在我们和美、英、法三国的关系中，也有类似的事实。可是，用不着说，那些国家的法院在战后不久作出的判决，是不免受感情因素和当时的气氛的影响的，甚至证人也受这种影响；当时的整个气氛不利于作出那种经过平心静气考虑了一切事实材料之后能够作出的判决。
    已经由此得出了结论，而且已经通过赦免对几乎所有被判刑的人们减轻了未服满的刑期。
    部长会议主席先生，你一定知道，伦敦“泰晤士报”曾经写道，据说在这次会谈中我们的作法在一定程度上将像古代的使者那样，每个人都大声疾呼地向别人指出他希望克服的缺点。我认为，我们不应当这样作，而必须诚心诚意地和通过冷静的考虑来设法达成真正的协议。德国部队曾侵入俄国，这是真的。曾经发生了许多不好的事情，这是真的。但是，俄国军队后来击退了进攻——我当然必须承认这一点——进入了德国，接着在德国，在战争期间发生了许多可怕的事情，这也是真的。我认为，如果我们希望在我们的关系中开始一个新的时期而且这是我们真诚的愿望的话；我们决不能过深地沉缅于往事的回顾中，因为这样做我们就只会在我们的道路上制造障碍。心里纯洁也是开始新时期的先决条件之一。
    部长会议主席先生，我不揣冒昧地指出我昨天的发言中的一点或几点，我在昨天的发言中曾经说，德意志民族和它新建立的国家不幸正处在一个以四大国之间的矛盾为标志的世界中。我请你考虑这一点：我们的所有困难中相当大的一部分是从下述事实产生的：四个胜利国在它们的政策发展过程中发生了分歧。我认为，我昨天充分地、详尽地而且清楚地说明了：我们也承认需要建立一个欧洲安全体系，并且我们也一定尽我们所能来创造一个足以保证一切有关方面的安全和真正防止战争的体系。
    如果你允许我的话，我现在请联邦外交部长勃伦塔诺先生发言。
