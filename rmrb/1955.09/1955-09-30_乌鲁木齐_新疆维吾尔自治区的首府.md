Urumqi is one of the largest cities in the border region of our motherland. It stands majestically at the northern foot of the Tianshan Bogda Peak, which shines with silver light all year round. According to old geographical publications, the city was built on the east bank of the Urumqi River. In the six years since liberation, as the urban area has continuously expanded westward, the Urumqi River is now embraced within the city.

A road network of more than 8,000 kilometers closely connects Urumqi with various parts of Xinjiang. Air routes from here can reach our capital Beijing, as well as Lanzhou, Yining, Kashgar, and other places. International routes extend to Almaty in the Soviet Union. Directly in front of Urumqi stretches the fertile land and grasslands of the Junggar Basin, which contain inexhaustible reserves of oil, coal, copper, oil shale, and other minerals. To the south, across the Tianshan Mountains, lies the rich Tarim Basin. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which is currently under construction, will pass through here. Urumqi is the political, economic, and cultural center of Xinjiang.

"Urumqi" means "beautiful pasture," and the city is as beautiful as its name suggests. Within the city, the streets are flat and clean. Among the clumps of poplar trees, new buildings are under construction everywhere. In the busiest central area of the city – Da Shizi (Grand Crossroads) – pedestrians wearing colorful costumes of various ethnic groups and chatting in their respective languages come and go in an endless stream. Beautiful buses travel back and forth. At night, red and green lights radiate everywhere, and loudspeakers broadcast music of various ethnic groups. Someone who comes to Urumqi after liberation cannot imagine how desolate and dilapidated it was before. At that time, when the spring snow melted, mud and garbage were everywhere. Some people said: "A camel could drown in the center of the street." In summer, yellow dust filled the air. The streets were pitch black at night, and stores closed their doors before dark. Electric lights shone weakly only in a few government offices. Cars were rarely seen on the streets. Heavy iron-wheeled carts made harsh noises on the streets from time to time, and teams of camels and donkeys appeared on the streets, transporting coal and various local products for the citizens.

Urumqi is a multi-ethnic city. It is home to more than 140,000 residents of 13 ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Han, Hui, and Kazakh, about half of whom have been added since liberation. During the dark years of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, the people of various fraternal ethnic groups living in the same city were deeply estranged from each other and did not interact. People of minority ethnic groups were concentrated in the Nanliang area. Although there were no demarcated boundaries, few people went out of or into the city unless it was necessary. Two years before liberation – in 1947 – the Kuomintang reactionaries also provoked bloody incidents between Uyghur and Han citizens. After liberation, a new relationship of equality, friendship, and mutual assistance was established among the people of all ethnic groups. Now, they live in harmony like brothers. Wherever you go – to government offices, factories, or other enterprises – you can see staff and workers of various ethnic groups working and living together harmoniously. Tajimaiti, a Uyghur worker at the "August 1st" Iron and Steel Plant's coking plant, selflessly imparted the new coal mining techniques he learned at the Huainan Coal Mine to workers of all fraternal ethnic groups, significantly improving everyone's production efficiency. Usman, a model apprentice and Uyghur worker at the October Automobile Repair Plant, learned the complex engine assembly techniques in just one month with the help of Han workers. An unbreakable and profound friendship has been established among the working people of all ethnic groups living in the new Xinjiang.

The people of the thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang jointly created Urumqi. Since liberation, they have been changing its appearance day by day with their joint creative labor. In the past, Urumqi had only a few dilapidated factories of a handicraft nature, such as ceramics, soap, and matches. Now, a number of modern industries, including non-ferrous metals, petroleum, iron and steel, machinery, automobile repair, cement, electricity, coal mining, textile, printing and dyeing, and flour, have been established in the urban and suburban areas. The first batch of industrial workers from Xinjiang's ethnic groups has been born. Commerce and trade have also developed rapidly. Thirteen specialized companies, such as trade, department store, and livestock product companies, have been established in Urumqi, and their branches are located throughout Xinjiang. On the highways leading west to Horgos on the Sino-Soviet border, south to Kashgar and Hotan, and east to the interior, a large number of trucks carrying furs and local products, tea, sugar, and fabrics are constantly traveling to and from here, and then to all parts of Xinjiang.

Urumqi's cultural and educational undertakings have also developed at a rapid pace since liberation, becoming an important base for cultivating talents for various construction projects in Xinjiang and a center for cultural and artistic activities. The number of students at Xinjiang University, the highest institution of learning in Xinjiang, has increased from more than 400 at the time of liberation to more than 1,200 now, 96 percent of whom are minority ethnic students. Xinjiang Medical College, a large-scale and well-equipped institution, is currently under construction in the western suburbs of the city. Secondary specialized schools for mining, health, and other fields are training a large number of middle-level technical personnel from various ethnic groups. The development of primary and secondary school education is even faster. All these schools are open to the children of workers, peasants, and herdsmen of all ethnic groups.

The Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Uzbek, and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang, men and women, young and old, are all good at singing and dancing. Whether in the rural fields or on the pastoral grasslands, one can hear beautiful songs and see graceful dances everywhere. The people of all ethnic groups living in Urumqi enjoy a richer and more colorful cultural life. Citizens can enjoy Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Qin Opera, and acrobatics to their heart's content. People of all ethnic groups are often lined up at the entrance of the cinema waiting to buy tickets. A grand theater with a capacity of 1,200 people, with a dance hall and a film projection room, is currently under construction in the center of the city. This will be the best place for artists of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to perform their artistic achievements. These days, in order to celebrate the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture Cultural Troupe, the Southern Xinjiang Cultural Troupe, and the Central National Song and Dance Troupe from the capital are all concentrated in Urumqi to perform various wonderful song and dance programs.

Ever since Xinjiang was peacefully liberated and the five-star red flag was planted throughout the Tianshan Mountains, Urumqi has become the capital of the people's Xinjiang. For six years, the Xinjiang Provincial National Democratic United Government, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, has successfully led the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to complete various social reforms and vigorously develop economic and cultural construction. Now, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is about to be established, and the cause of socialist construction in Xinjiang is about to begin a new historical stage. As the location of the People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Urumqi will surely make greater contributions to the various construction undertakings in Xinjiang in the future.

    乌鲁木齐——新疆维吾尔自治区的首府
    徐述超
    乌鲁木齐是祖国边疆最大的城市之一。它雄踞在终年闪耀着银色光辉的天山博格达高峰的北麓。按照旧时地理书刊的记载，城市建筑在乌鲁木齐河的东岸。解放六年来，随着市区不断向西扩展，乌鲁木齐河现在已经移到她的怀里来了。
    总长八千多公里的公路网把乌鲁木齐和新疆各地紧密地联系在一起。航空线从这里可以通到我国首都北京和兰州、伊宁、喀什等地，国际航线通往苏联的阿拉木图。乌鲁木齐的正前面，扩展着准噶尔盆地肥美的土地和草原，那里蕴藏着无尽的石油、煤、铜、油母页岩等矿藏。往南，穿过天山，便是富饶的塔里木盆地。正在赶修的兰新铁路将从这里穿过。乌鲁木齐是新疆的政治、经济和文化的中心。
    “乌鲁木齐”的意思是“美丽的牧场”，这个城市正如它的名字一样美丽。市内，街道平坦而整洁。丛丛白杨间，到处都可以看到正在修建的一幢幢新的建筑物。在全市最热闹的中心区——大十字，穿着各民族鲜艳服装和用各民族语言谈笑着的行人川流不息。漂亮的公共汽车来往行驶着。入夜，四处放射着红绿灯光，喇叭筒播送出各民族的音乐。一个解放后来到乌鲁木齐市的人是不能想像到从前它是多么荒凉和衰老。那时候，每当春雪融化时，遍地是淤泥和垃圾，有人说：“街中心能淹死骆驼”。夏天，黄土飞扬。夜间的街道是漆黑的，商店不到天黑就关起店门，电灯只在少数机关里闪着微弱的光。街上很少看到汽车。不时有笨重的铁轮大车在街上发出刺耳的声音，一队队骆驼和毛驴出现在街头，给市民们运来煤炭和各种土货。
    乌鲁木齐市是一个多民族的城市。这里居住着维吾尔、汉、回、哈萨克等十三个民族的十四万多居民，其中有一半左右是解放后增加的。在国民党反动统治的黑暗的年月里，居住在同一城市的各兄弟民族人民彼此隔阂很深，不相往来。少数民族人民都集中居住在南梁一带。虽然没有划地为界，但无事很少有人出城或进城。解放前二年——一九四七年，国民党反动派还挑起了维吾尔族和汉族市民的流血事件。解放以后，各族人民之间建立起了平等友爱互助的新关系。现在，他们像兄弟一样的和睦相处。无论你走到那个机关、工厂或其他企业，都可以看到各民族的工作人员和职工，融洽无间地劳动和生活在一起。“八一”钢铁厂焦炭厂维吾尔族工人塔吉买提，在淮南煤矿学习回来以后，无保留地把新的采炭技术，热情地传授给各兄弟民族工人，显著提高了大家的生产效率。十月汽车修配厂甲等模范、维吾尔族学徒乌斯满，在汉族工人帮助下，一个月就学会了复杂的引擎装配技术。生活在新中国的新疆各民族劳动人民之间已建立起了坚不可摧的深厚友谊。
    新疆十三个民族的人民共同创建了乌鲁木齐市。解放以后，他们又以共同的创造性的劳动日新月异地改变着它的面貌。过去乌鲁木齐市仅仅有陶瓷、肥皂、火柴等几个手工业性质的破烂工厂，而现在，在市区和郊区已先后建立起有色金属、石油、钢铁、机器、汽车修配、水泥、电力、煤矿、纺织、印染、面粉等许多现代化的工业。诞生了新疆各民族自己的第一批产业工人。商业和贸易已有了迅速的发展。在乌鲁木齐市建立起了贸易、百货、畜产等十三个专业公司，它的分支机构遍布全疆各地。在西面通向中苏边境霍尔果斯，南面到达喀什、和阗，东面通向关内的公路上，大量的汽车载着皮毛土产，载着茶、糖、布匹，不断驶向这里，又转而驶向全疆各地。
    乌鲁木齐的文化教育事业解放后也以很快的速度在发展着，成为新疆培养各项建设人材的重要基地和文化、艺术活动的中心。新疆的最高学府新疆学院的学生人数，已由解放时的四百多人增加到了现在的一千二百多人，其中百分之九十六是少数民族学生。市的西郊目前正在建筑着一座规模宏大、设备完善的新疆医学院。矿业、卫生等各中等专业学校，正在造就着大批的各民族的中等技术人材。中小学教育的发展更快。所有这些学校，都为各民族工、农、牧民的子女敞开着大门。
    新疆维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔吉克、乌兹别克等民族人民，男女老少都能歌善舞。无论在农村田野，在牧区草原，随处都可以听到美妙的歌声，看到翩翩的舞姿。住在乌鲁木齐的各族人民更享受着丰富多采的文化生活。市民们可以随心所好地去观赏京剧、评剧、秦剧和杂剧。电影院门口经常排列着等候购票的各族观众。目前，市区中心正在兴建一座可以容纳一千二百人，附有跳舞厅、电影放映室等的大剧院，这将是全新疆各民族的艺术家们表演他们的艺术成就的最好场所。这些日子，为了庆祝新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，伊犁哈萨克自治州文工团、南疆文工团和来自首都的中央民族歌舞团，都集中在乌鲁木齐演出各种精采的歌舞节目。
    自从新疆和平解放、五星红旗插遍天山南北那时起，乌鲁木齐就成为人民新疆的首府。六年来，设在这里的新疆省民族民主联合政府，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，胜利领导着全疆各族人民完成了各项社会改革，大力发展了经济、文化建设事业。现在，新疆维吾尔自治区就要成立了，新疆的社会主义建设事业即将开始新的历史阶段。作为新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会的所在地，乌鲁木齐市今后必将对新疆的各项建设事业作出更大的贡献。
