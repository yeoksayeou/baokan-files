Shandong Province's Department of Agriculture organized another visiting group of one hundred and ten people on September 1st to visit various places and learn grain production increase experiences. This visiting group will first go to Zhang Shirui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jimo County to visit. The cooperative has nine hundred mu of land, which can be used as three thousand mu, that is, seven crops can be planted in two years. The planting sequence is roughly: first plant potatoes, intercropping corn in the ditch, then plant Chinese cabbage after the potatoes and corn are harvested, then plant wheat after the cabbage is harvested. In 1954, the annual yield reached more than 1,200 jin per mu. Then, the visiting group went to Kunlun County, where, in addition to learning from the local farmers’ experience in cultivating high-yielding sweet potatoes, they also visited in detail the specific process of how farmers eat sweet potatoes in various ways. The farmers here can use sweet potato flour to make dumplings, noodles, “xu gao” (a type of steamed cake), pancakes and other twenty kinds of very tasty foods. Finally, they will also go to Huang County and Zhaoyuan County to learn about high-yielding corn and hybrid methods. The representatives from various places are very interested in the above-mentioned visiting projects, and they have expressed their intention to study hard and bring back the methods and experiences of increasing production from other places.

Prior to this, Shandong Province's Department of Agriculture has organized agricultural labor models, agricultural cooperative directors, technicians from technology promotion stations, and agricultural cadres from various specialized counties this year in succession to exchange agricultural technology reforms and grain production increase experiences in the form of visits, and all have achieved good results.

    山东组织农业参观团学习增产粮食的经验
    山东省农业厅在九月一日又有一个一百一十人的参观团，赴各地参观学习增产粮食的经验。这个参观团，首先要到即墨县张式瑞农业生产合作社去参观。该社有九百亩土地，可以当三千亩土地来使用，即二年能种七季。种植的顺序大致是：先种马铃薯，沟内套种玉米，马铃薯、玉米收了种白菜，白菜收了种麦子，一九五四年的常年产量每亩达一千二百多斤。然后，参观团到昆仑县，除学习当地甘薯高额丰产的培植经验外，还详细参观农民对甘薯多样吃法的具体过程，这里的农民能用甘薯面作出饺子、面条、虚糕、饼子等二十多种很好吃的食品来。最后还要去黄县、招远县学习玉米高额丰产和杂交的办法。这次各地代表对上述参观的项目，都很感兴趣，纷纷表示要好好学习，将外地增产办法、经验带回去。
    在此以前，山东省农业厅今年曾连续组织各地农业劳动模范、农业合作社长、技术推广站的技术员及各专县农业干部，以参观的形式，交流农业技术改革和增产粮食的经验，均获得很好的效果。
