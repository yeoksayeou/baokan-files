Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnant naval and air forces, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit artillery entrenched on Jinmen Island, are continuously harassing and sabotaging our southeastern coastal areas.

In August, American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft made a total of 420 sorties with 755 planes, intruding into the coastal areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, as well as inland airspace, for harassment. Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships and Chiang Kai-shek bandit artillery entrenched on Jinmen Island fired more than 370 shells at Dadeng Island, Xiaodeng Island, Xiamen Island, Lianhe, Weitou, and other places in Fujian Province, as well as cargo ships sailing at sea. In August, the search regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 8th Army entrenched on Jinmen Island twice dispatched small groups of armed bandits, under the cover of warships, to sneak ashore near Weitou and Chongwu in Fujian Province for harassment.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops guarding the southeastern coastal areas continuously struck at the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who came to harass and sabotage. In August, the air force units and anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army shot down and damaged a total of five American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft. In the battles to repel two groups of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops landing for harassment, the coastal defense troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front killed one Chiang Kai-shek bandit major company commander, one radio operator, captured four Chiang Kai-shek bandit personnel including a sergeant squad leader, and seized two light machine guns, four carbines, one pistol, one signal pistol, one radio, and a quantity of other military supplies.

During this period, five soldiers from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Jinmen Island and Dadan Island defected to the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, bringing two heavy machine guns, one wooden boat with two motors, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.
