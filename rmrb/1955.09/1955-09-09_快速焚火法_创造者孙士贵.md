    Sun Shigui, Creator of the "Rapid Firing Method"
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Huang Sha
    For the past two years, the railway locomotive departments nationwide have been widely promoting a "Rapid Firing Method" that significantly saves coal. In 1954 alone, more than 3,140 train stokers across the country had skillfully mastered this advanced operating method. The locomotive team where Sun Shigui, the creator of the "Rapid Firing Method," was located used this method, reducing the cost of their locomotive's transportation tasks by about 30 percent, saving the country more than 1,100 tons of coal in two years and eight months.
    Communist Party member Sun Shigui is now a driver at the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Administration. He had been an apprentice and helper on the railway for a long time. In 1949, he was promoted to stoker. At that time, he, like other stokers, used the old methods from the Japanese puppet regime, shoveling coal into the firebox one shovel at a time. This method was not only wasteful of coal but also very tiring.
    In 1950, several Soviet experts came to the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot. The Soviet experts valued thrift very much. Soon after their arrival, they told the Chinese crew members: Coal is the country's black gold; it is painstakingly dug out of the ground by coal miners and transported from far away to here. We must not waste it. The Soviet experts also pointed out: Coal accounts for about 50 percent of the expenses in railway locomotives. Saving coal also reduces transportation costs. Once, a Soviet expert saw a bunch of dirty cotton yarn thrown on the floor of Sun Shigui's locomotive. He picked it up carefully and handed it to Sun Shigui, saying, "Clean it up, and it can still be used." Sun Shigui was very touched by this. Not long after, the Soviet expert said to Sun Shigui again: "As a stoker and assistant driver, you should not only vigorously save fuel while ensuring the steam and water supply needed by the driver, but also maintain the heart of the locomotive—the boiler." Sun Shigui found this statement very novel because he had always thought that firing and maintaining the boiler had nothing to do with each other. He thought about it for a long time but couldn't understand the principle. Finally, the Soviet expert told him, "Try to minimize the intrusion of cold air into the firebox of the boiler during firing, reduce the number of times coal is added, keep the furnace door slightly open and open it less frequently. On the one hand, this can maintain the high temperature of the firebox and save coal. On the other hand, it can also prevent the furnace wall from being damaged by cold contraction and heat expansion, extending the life of the boiler."
    From then on, Sun Shigui was determined to save coal by focusing on firing. First, he learned coal-throwing techniques from stokers with better skills. Every time he returned from a run, he didn't rest and didn't even bother to eat. Holding a few steamed buns or biscuits, he followed the crew members of other locomotives to run the train. In a short time, he learned several different coal-throwing methods.
    Once, when he was running with Sun Wanquan, the assistant driver of locomotive 816, he noticed that Sun Wanquan always failed to get the last shovel of coal into the furnace door and that his speed was also very fast. This gave him great inspiration. He thought: If every shovel were thrown using this method, wouldn't it greatly reduce the intrusion of cold air into the firebox? The next day, he began practicing rapid coal-throwing on his locomotive. At first, because he was not skilled, the shovel hit the furnace door with a clanging sound when adding coal. He broke a shovel in a few days, and the people in the locomotive team complained: Old Sun is wasting too many shovels. Once, he didn't throw a shovel well and injured his leg. However, under the encouragement of the Party organization, he did not lose heart. He found an old "locomotive coal-throwing model" in the depot and continued to practice with this model every day after returning from a run. In the severe winter, the temperature in the depot was always more than ten degrees below zero Celsius. Sun Shigui wore only a cotton undershirt, sweat pouring from his head, and persevered in practicing there.
    Finally, Sun Shigui mastered the rapid coal-throwing technique of not inserting the shovel into the furnace door, shortening the time required for throwing three shovels of coal from twelve seconds in the past to as little as three and a half seconds, creating the "Rapid Firing Method."
    On November 12, 1954, on the Zhalantun and Ang'angxi railway lines in Heilongjiang Province, railway driver Sun Shigui, based on the Soviet advanced experience of not stopping at intermediate stations, drove a train 146 kilometers in one go, passing through thirteen intermediate stations without stopping, creating the first achievement of intermediate station non-stop operation on a single-track railway in our country.
    Sun Shigui has been awarded the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal for these creations and achievements. Recently, he was also selected as a young activist in Heilongjiang Province to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Congress.

    “快速焚火法”创造者孙士贵
    新华社记者  黄沙
    最近两年多来，全国铁路机务部门普遍推广了一种大量节约煤炭的“快速焚火法”。仅一九五四年内，全国就已经有三千一百四十多个火车司炉熟练地掌握了这种先进的操作方法。“快速焚火法”的创造者孙士贵所在的包车组用这种操作法，使自己的机车在完成运输任务中降低了成本百分之三十左右，在两年零八个月中为国家节省了一千一百多吨煤炭。
    共产党员孙士贵现在是哈尔滨铁路管理局昂昂溪机务段的司机。很早以前，他就在铁路上做学徒和帮工。一九四九年他被提升为司炉，当时他和别的司炉一样，也是用伪满时的老办法一锹一锹地往火室里添煤。这种办法不仅很费煤，而且非常累人。
    一九五零年，好几位苏联专家来到了昂昂溪机务段。苏联专家很重视节约，刚到不久就告诉中国的乘务人员说：煤是国家的黑色金子，它由煤矿工人们辛苦地从地下挖出来，从很远的地方运到这里，我们不能白白地把它浪费掉。苏联专家还指出：煤在铁路机务上的开支大约占百分之五十以上，节省了煤也就降低了运输成本。有一次，一个苏联专家在孙士贵的机车上看到一束用脏了的棉纱抛在地板上，便爱惜地拾起来交给孙士贵说：“把它收拾起来，洗一洗还能用。”孙士贵听了很受感动。过了没多久，这位苏联专家又对孙士贵说：“作为一个司炉和副司机，不仅要在保证司机所需要的汽、水供应下，大力节省燃料，同时还要保养机车上的心脏——锅炉。”孙士贵听到这段话感到很新奇，因为他一直认为烧火和保养锅炉没有关系。他想了很久没有想明白这个道理，最后苏联专家告诉他：“在焚火中尽量使冷风少侵入锅炉的火室，减少添煤次数，小开炉门和少开炉门，一方面可以保持火室高温，节省煤炭，另一方面也可以使炉壁避免因冷缩热涨而受到损害，延长锅炉使用寿命。”
    从此以后，孙士贵就决心从焚火方面来节省煤炭。首先，他向技术较好的司炉学习投煤经验。每次跑车回来，他不休息，甚至连饭都顾不得吃，手里拿着几个馒头或烧饼，紧跟着其他机车的乘务员一道去跑车。在很短的时间内，他就一连学会了几种不同的投煤方法。
    有一次，他跟八一六号机车上的副司机孙万全跑车时，发现孙万全每次往火室里添最后一锹煤时，总是锹不进炉门，速度也很快。这给他很大启示，他想：假如每锹都用这个方法，不就可以使侵入火室的冷风大量减少吗？第二天，他就在自己的机车上开始练习快速投煤。起初，由于不熟练，添煤时铁锹把炉门碰得叮当响，不几天就碰坏了一把铁锹，同包车组的人还提意见说：老孙太费锹啦。有一次一锹没投好把腿也砸伤了。但是，他在党组织的鼓励下并没有灰心。他在车库里找到一台破旧的“机车投炭模型”，每天跑车回来以后，就利用这台模型继续练习。在严寒的冬季里，车库里的温度总是在摄氏零下十多度，孙士贵只穿一件线内衣、头上冒着热汗，坚持不懈地在那里练习。
    最后，孙士贵终于掌握了铁锹不进炉门的快速投煤技术，使过去每投三锹煤需要十二秒钟缩短到最快时只需要三秒半钟，创造了“快速焚火法”。
    一九五四年十一月十二日，在黑龙江省扎兰屯、昂昂溪铁路线上，铁路司机孙士贵根据苏联的中间站不停车的先进经验，驾驶着一列火车一气走完了一百四十六公里，沿途经过十三个中间站都没有停车，又创造了我国铁道上第一次单线行车中间站不停车的成绩。
    孙士贵由于这些创造和成绩，曾经获得“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章。最近，他又被评选为黑龙江省出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的青年积极分子。
