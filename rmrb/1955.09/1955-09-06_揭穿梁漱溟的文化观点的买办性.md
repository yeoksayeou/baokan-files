On the surface, Mr. Liang Shuming and Hu Shi are different, and they even had some quarrels. Hu Shi once publicly stated that he would "rather not avoid the name of counter-revolutionary," while Mr. Liang Shuming has always proclaimed himself a "revolutionary" for decades. Hu Shi openly said that it doesn't matter if the country is subjugated, citing the "Yin remnants" as an example, while Mr. Liang Shuming claimed to be seeking a path of "national self-salvation." Hu Shi wanted "complete Westernization," making it clear at a glance that he was a running dog of imperialism, while Mr. Liang Shuming consistently promoted the unique spirit of Chinese culture, using this to argue with the Hu Shi faction. Despite these differences, these differences are not the main ones; the common ground between Hu Shi and Mr. Liang Shuming is fundamental. They both resolutely opposed the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement, and they both denied the existence of imperialism and feudalism. They only adopted different methods in how to counter Marxism.

Liang Shuming's opposition to the revolution has not only theory, but also action; his writings on cultural issues are to establish a theoretical basis for his actions against the revolution.

Mr. Liang Shuming obliterates the class content of culture, deliberately lumping together so-called "Western," "Chinese," and "Indian" cultures. He inherited the views of reactionary bourgeois sociology in the West, lumping together two distinct cultures existing in the West, representing two stages of historical development (capitalism and socialism), calling them "Western culture." In essence, he regarded religious superstition as Indian culture, the ideology of capitalist society as Western culture, and the feudal patriarchal ethical system as Chinese culture. He used this vague meaning of "culture" to promote his feudalist and imperialist culture. This absurd view had a profound influence in the academic and research departments of old China. In the old China's philosophy, history research institutions and university teaching, the "Chinese," "Indian," and "Western" cultures have always been regarded as three entities. Of course, this view did not start with Mr. Liang Shuming, but the influence of Mr. Liang Shuming's "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies" played a role in fueling the flames. Even today, old intellectuals constantly reveal vague and confused notions about Chinese, Indian, and Western cultures. These remaining influences of thought will seriously hinder our ability to correctly develop scientific research. Today, after the criticism of Hu Shi's thought, people have recognized the reactionary face of Hu Shi, the comprador scholar, but some people still believe that Mr. Liang Shuming understands the spirit of Chinese culture, is patriotic, and his thoughts are different from Hu Shi's. If these erroneous views are not clarified in time, they will hinder our understanding of Chinese culture and hinder the construction of our socialist culture.

From what standpoint does Mr. Liang Shuming view Chinese culture? He believes that due to the "early development of wisdom" of the Chinese nation, "five major diseases of Chinese culture" have emerged: "immaturity," "senility," "unrealistic," "falling into negativity and having no future," and "ambiguous and unclear" ("Essentials of Chinese Culture," pages 322-326). He also said that the Chinese nation's character has ten unfavorable characteristics: selfishness, stinginess, hypocrisy, peacefulness and weakness, contentment, conservatism, carelessness, perseverance and cruelty, resilience and elasticity, and sophistication. Compared with "Westerners," Mr. Liang Shuming believes that "what Westerners excel in, we lack" in four aspects: Chinese people lack "public awareness," lack "discipline habits," lack "organizational ability," and lack "rule of law spirit."

It is already very clear that Mr. Liang Shuming basically agrees with Hu Shi's "five ghosts" theory, only thinking that his "statements are a bit clumsy." He only thinks that the "five ghosts" theory is not substantial enough, "too shallow," not as "comprehensive" and "in-depth" as his own so-called "five major symptoms," "ten major characteristics," and "four major shortcomings." Mr. Liang Shuming believes that he is more "profound" than Hu Shi in that Hu Shi only simply pointed out some "shortcomings" of Chinese culture, and it was not "comprehensive," while Mr. Liang Shuming not only found more "shortcomings" than Hu Shi, but also pointed out the advantages of Chinese culture, and emphasized that this is the final destination of world culture - "Confucian spirit," "Confucianism."

Does Mr. Liang Shuming truly cherish the excellent traditions of Chinese culture? No. On the contrary, Mr. Liang Shuming obliterates the sum of the material and spiritual wealth created by the Chinese people for generations - culture. The "three major characteristics" of China in his eyes are: (1) "vast territory and large population," (2) "assimilation and integration of a large nation," and (3) "long history, unparalleled in the world" ("Essentials of Chinese Culture" page 7). Originally, China is just a group with a large territory, a large population, many ethnic groups, and a long history. Mr. Liang Shuming just habitually calls it "Chinese culture," but he actually very much agrees with the slander of China by the imperialist element Russell, and he repeatedly cites Russell's slanderous fallacy that "China is actually a cultural entity rather than a country," and regards it as a kindred spirit.

In Mr. Liang Shuming's view, the excellent tradition of Chinese culture worth recommending to the world is Confucian thought. Mr. Liang Shuming once pretended to have the compassionate feelings of a religious person, praising Confucius's doctrine:

"I also look at Westerners with pity. At this time of material exhaustion, they want to regain their spirit, but what they call spirit is nothing more than that little bit of Hebrew stuff, rushing left and right, never leaving this circle. It is truly what is called never having heard the Great Way. Shouldn't I guide them to this path of Confucius!

"They have never tasted the true taste of life. Shouldn't I contribute the life of Confucius that I have seen to them! However, it is impossible for Westerners to find Confucius, so there is no need to discuss it. Even in today's China, some people advocate Western learning, and some people advocate Buddhism, but when it comes to Confucius, they are embarrassed to speak out, and it is equally impossible for people to understand the truth of Confucius. If I don't take the lead in advocating it, who else will?" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," preface, pages 3-4) Here, let's not talk about Mr. Liang Shuming's ignorance of Western and Chinese history, but let's see what the Confucius that Mr. Liang Shuming praises is all about: "What a difficult thing mankind is to deal with! The so-called 'sages and heroes' of ancient times all dealt with them by fooling them; Confucius alone removed the barriers, enlightened their minds, and then dealt with them. What a boldness this is! What methods are there in this! It is difficult to deal with ordinary people, but it is especially difficult to deal with intelligent people. ... Confucius alone puts old clich√©s, shallow and mediocre things in front of your eyes, saying them in your ears, as if they are all things that make people feel uninterested and sleepy when they hear them; but he is not afraid that you don't want them. ... Without extremely high vision and extremely deep insights, completely understanding in one's mind what kind of thing mankind is and what mankind is all about, how could he do this! Alas, holy! This can truly look down on everything!" ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement," page 74) From the above passage, it can be fully seen how Mr. Liang Shuming admires Confucius's clever means of being good at "dealing with" the masses of people, and how good he is at dealing with intelligent people. This kind of shouting of revivalism, praising Confucius to the sky, "Alas, holy!" represents the resistance of stubborn and conservative elements who felt panic in the face of the power of the New Culture Movement at that time. Mr. Lu Xun once pointed out how those revivalists gained the favor of imperialism: "China has abolished reading the classics, but don't church schools still hire rotten Confucians as teachers, teaching students to read the Four Books? The Republic of China has abolished kneeling and bowing, but don't Jewish schools insist on hiring old remnants as teachers, asking students to kowtow and pay respects! Don't the newspapers run by foreigners for Chinese people to read most oppose the small reforms since the May Fourth Movement? And the Chinese junior editors under the foreign editor-in-chief worship Taoism and preserve national essence!" ("Huagai Collection," "Suddenly Thought Of" 6)

The Confucian thought that Mr. Liang Shuming worships has its specific content. From what angle does Mr. Liang Shuming promote Confucius and Confucianism? He said:

"Confucius's only important attitude is not to care about gains and losses. This is the most distinctive attitude of Confucianism that is different from others, and it has not been lost until later, and it has evolved into the Chinese people's style, which is a unique color of Chinese culture." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 131)

Originally, Mr. Liang Shuming believes that the true value of Confucius's doctrine lies in his "not caring about gains and losses." He believes that this attitude is Confucius's virtue and the unique color of Chinese culture. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle precisely cares about the gains and losses of national survival. Thus, in Mr. Liang Shuming's view, the truth of national struggle and class struggle pointed out by Marxism does not conform to the spirit of Confucius's sage, nor does it conform to the spirit of Chinese culture.

In addition to Mr. Liang Shuming, who promotes the "virtue" of concession to us, and applauds these "virtues" of humility, are our enemies - imperialism and warlord bureaucrats. Warlord bureaucrats have always made the people concede, and they never care about the interests of their own nation in front of imperialism, and have always pursued a policy of selling out the country and surrendering. Mr. Liang's theory is precisely welcomed by imperialism.

The Chinese nation loves peace, but is also hardworking, brave, and rich in the revolutionary tradition of resisting oppression. In the history of the Han people, it is full of peasant uprisings of all sizes, and has produced many national heroes and revolutionary leaders. Mr. Liang Shuming closes his eyes and does not see these facts, and stubbornly says that the spirit of slavish tolerance of so-called "not caring about gains and losses" is the "characteristic" of Chinese culture. This is a complete slander of the excellent cultural traditions of China.

Mr. Liang Shuming's erroneous thought also has its philosophical basis, which is Mr. Liang's intuitionism, mysticism, and subjective idealism. Mr. Liang attempts to cover the sky with one hand, obliterating the truth of class struggle, covering up the two great mountains of imperialism and feudalism. He fundamentally obliterates the bloody facts of the vast working people suffering from hunger, cold, and humiliation, but shouts everywhere to promote "benevolence" that includes even the enemy, which is actually acting as an accomplice for the class enemy. The "benevolence" in Mr. Liang's mouth is essentially unkindness.

Mr. Liang Shuming is not satisfied with this. He further guides the doctrine of "benevolence" into the quagmire of mysticism and intuitionism, connecting with many reactionary philosophical schools of imperialism. Mr. Liang Shuming explains "benevolence" as "intuition" and "impulse":

"This keen intuition is what Confucius called benevolence. ... Confucianism completely depends on intuition, so the only important thing is to have keen and sharp intuition; and the only thing to fear is dull and numb intuition." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," pages 126-127) It also says: As long as there is this intuitive "benevolence," one can live a "life of absolute joy" like Confucius. We don't need to blindly guess whether Confucius himself lived a "life of absolute joy." According to Mr. Liang Shuming's understanding, the reason why Confucius can be "happy" is because Confucius "originally did not recognize calculation and caused his emotions to be tied to the outside, so he had no so-called gains or losses." As long as "emotions are not tied to the outside," one can be "full of vitality, and be content everywhere. There is definitely not a moment when he is not happy in his heart."
("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 137). What is this if not thorough intuitionism, mysticism, and subjective idealism?

Mr. Liang Shuming deliberately explains the pain caused by the system of class oppression in society as merely a matter of attitude towards life and a matter of understanding. It has nothing to do with class oppression, but is caused by people's attitudes towards life issues. Therefore, he tells people to follow his so-called Confucius's doctrine, not to resist external unreasonable oppression, but to "seek within oneself" and adjust their view of life. One can then be "full of vitality" and be as "happy" as Confucius. According to Mr. Liang Shuming's statement, since China has no feudalism and imperialism, and naturally no class oppression, and China has one more Confucius, this is the most superior condition. As long as everyone changes their thinking and makes them no longer "tie their emotions to the outside" and "not care about gains and losses," they can make everyone "be content everywhere," and achieve the "happiness" that revolution cannot obtain without revolution. There is such a good thing in the world, but people just don't see it and don't believe it. No wonder Mr. Liang Shuming tirelessly shouted loudly to promote Confucius's "vital attitude" towards life.

The Confucius and Confucianism that Mr. Liang Shuming talks about are completely according to the requirements of imperialism and feudalism. If he says that he speaks somewhat close to Confucianism, it is because he has developed the reactionary part of Confucianism. Mr. Liang Shuming, like some other philosophers employed by imperialism, is launching poisonous arrows against the revolutionary forces that pursue scientific truth and strive for democracy. They are all putting forward various reactionary doctrines in order to oppose Marxism.

In order to establish a set of counter-revolutionary theoretical bases, Mr. Liang Shuming put forward his intuitionism and mysticism, and said that this is China's "contribution" to world culture. He said that some European philosophers (Note by Yu: It should be said that the most reactionary philosophers in Europe and the United States during the imperialist period) "went around in a circle and unknowingly returned to the inside. People like Nietzsche, James, Dewey, Bergson, Eucken... are roughly like this, and Bergson and Eucken are especially marked." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 176)

Mr. Liang Shuming praised the German idealist philosopher Eucken, who promoted reactionary vitalism, saying:

"He is most opposed to pursuing things externally, and has a lot of the spirit of 'self-reflection and sincerity' and 'self-satisfaction'" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 180).

When he recommended another British reactionary idealist philosopher, Russell, he said: "His purpose is only one sentence of 'free growth,' and the main point of Confucius is also just not hindering vitality." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 181)

"He sees that people's bad actions do not come from their nature, but are caused by vitality being injured. As he said: 'If natural impulses cannot be adequately expressed, the result is either a lack of vitality or a violent and self-destructive new impulse.' ... This is completely the same as Confucius's view." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 182)

In addition, Mr. Liang Shuming issued various praises for all idealist philosophers employed by imperialism, such as Driesch, Bergson, Dewey, and other reactionary schools. We don't need to make more citations here. Only from the facts cited above, it is not difficult to see that the common characteristics of this series of reactionary subjective idealist teams are their anti-rationalism, anti-revolution, anti-science, promotion of mysticism, and advocacy of instinctual impulses and blind adventures. This kind of thought is none other than the characteristic of imperialist thought. Since the twentieth century, these schools have formed a countercurrent that serves the dying imperialism and opposes Marxism. Mr. Liang Shuming's reactionary philosophy is under the countercurrent of worldwide anti-rationalist idealist philosophy, in conjunction with the domestic countercurrent of revivalism to promote "Chinese culture." Mr. Liang Shuming meticulously collected many reactionary doctrines to enrich and prove his Confucian and Confucian benevolence, which just shows that Mr. Liang Shuming's doctrine is in line with the basic stance and views of those reactionary schools.

He fully accepts the philosophy of imperialism, but unlike Hu Shi, who is only satisfied with the pragmatism school of Dewey, he is a more "completely Westernized" feudal and comprador scholar.

Imperialism hopes that we Chinese people will always be trapped in poverty and never be able to turn over. Mr. Liang Shuming promotes "self-satisfaction" and "being content with one's lot," and thus praises the advantage of Chinese culture in "enjoying what he has in front of him without making new extravagant hopes." According to Mr. Liang Shuming's method, the "suffering" suffered by "Westerners" "Chinese people have not suffered." "Those who wear brocade may not be happy, and those who wear rags may be very happy" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 151).

Imperialism hopes that we will always maintain the feudal system, so that they can control the vast number of Chinese peasants through the feudal landlord class. Mr. Liang Shuming tries his best to promote "Confucius's ethics, in fact, contains his so-called clean rules, fatherly love, filial piety... it is not exclusively oppressing one aspect" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 152). He created a theoretical basis for the feudal system, which is completely in line with the needs of imperialism. Mr. Liang Shuming's "village governance" is to use organization, action, and violence to promote this counter-revolutionary "ethical system." It not only protects feudalism, but also maintains the interests of imperialism.

The cultural compradors of imperialism arbitrarily slander Chinese culture, saying that "China is inferior to others in everything." Like Hu Shi, he shamelessly said that China is "inferior to others in everything," "literature is inferior to others, music is inferior to others, art is inferior to others..." This slavish thought has long been thoroughly criticized. Mr. Liang Shuming's slander of Chinese culture is completely consistent with Hu Shi, but his attitude is more implicit and not as blatantly comprador as Hu Shi. When he talks about the issue of Chinese culture, he says, "Religion... lacks the great and loving spirit of Western religion; literature such as poetry, lyrics, operas, although there are many clever and ingenious places, it always feels that there is less great spirit, deep thought, and true emotion; art such as music and painting, I don't understand very well, I privately think that there may be very valuable places, but it seems to be only a fleeting civilization rather than a popular culture. Knowledge-wise science is simply non-existent; philosophy is also rarely studied... What society generally has are just some confused and shallow thoughts." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 153)

Facts show that in the course of thousands of years of historical development, China has produced many great thinkers, scientists, inventors, politicians, military strategists, writers, and artists. We have many inventions and creations of world significance. Our Han and Tang Dynasties reached the highest peak of cultural development in the world at that time. Here, Mr. Liang Shuming takes a very rude and sweeping attitude towards the great contribution of Chinese culture to world culture, which is completely the same as Hu Shi. However, the place where Mr. Liang Shuming is more "profound" than Hu Shi is that he also cited the "advantages" and characteristics of Chinese culture:

"Only Confucius's kind of spiritual life, which is like religion but not religion, not art but also art, is somewhat similar to the philosophy of the late life faction in the West." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 153).

This is Mr. Liang Shuming's entire evaluation of Chinese culture.

Here, it is not difficult to see that Mr. Liang Shuming does not dare to touch the decadent things that imperialism hopes us to preserve, such as the feudal system and backward material life, and sings the "superiority" of the feudal system according to the will of imperialism, calling it "ethics-oriented." Mr. Liang Shuming said that in an ethics-oriented society, people do not oppress people, but only feel "harmonious," and believes that this is the essence of Chinese culture. Imperialism tries to destroy our national self-confidence and slander the excellent traditions of our culture's scientific and democratic nature. Mr. Liang Shuming also does not dare to offend the will of imperialism, and searches for "evidence" to slander Chinese culture.

When Hu Shi peddled pragmatism, he transformed some ancient Chinese thinkers into "pragmatists" that he liked. Mr. Liang Shuming was not willing to be outdone. He put forward Confucius and Confucian spirit as representatives of the bourgeois intuitionism and mysticism of Europe and America. According to the above analysis, Mr. Liang Shuming's Confucius and Confucian spirit are completely manufactured according to the specifications required by imperialism.

Therefore, we say that Mr. Liang Shuming's promotion of Confucius and Confucian spirit is a reactionary act of serving imperialism under the guise of "loving the country" and "saving the country," and slandering Chinese culture from the standpoint and viewpoint of imperialism. The paths he and Hu Shi took are exactly the same.

Only we Marxists have the correct attitude towards national culture and the treatment of cultural heritage. We oppose both stubbornly conservative nationalism and slavish compradorism, national surrenderism, and nihilism. We must summarize the past culture, as Chairman Mao pointed out, from Confucius to Sun Yat-sen, but we resolutely oppose the attitude and methods adopted by Mr. Liang Shuming. Although we have different opinions on Confucius's thought today, we oppose Mr. Liang Shuming's adoption of the standards of imperialist employed scholars Russell, Dewey, Eucken, Bergson, and Kropotkin, first transforming Confucius into a subjective idealist of mysticism and intuitionism, and then saying that such mysticism and intuitionism is the "essence" of "Chinese culture." Mr. Liang Shuming said that his own thoroughly corrupt philosophy is the "Confucius" philosophy, and declared that this reactionary philosophical thought is the main component of "everything our life depends on" ("Essentials of Chinese Culture," page 1). This is what every scientific worker who loves the motherland's culture cannot tolerate and must smash.
