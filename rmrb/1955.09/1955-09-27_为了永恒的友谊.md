    For Eternal Friendship
    Lieutenant Colonel Z. Wolwa, Head of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Polish Army
    The People's Republic of China is thousands of kilometers away from us, but the Chinese people are close and friendly to us. We are walking the same path, our goals are the same, and we are fighting for a common cause – consolidating peace and building socialism.

    We have deep sympathy and respect for the great Chinese people – the most beautiful people in the world. We watch with great pleasure the victories of our Chinese comrades – first the victory of the people's revolution, then the victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea; now we are watching the Chinese people's struggle on the great front of peaceful construction. We are developing friendly cooperation and economic ties with the Chinese people, and strengthening the bonds of cultural cooperation.

    The Polish people and their armed forces are very interested in understanding the beautiful and unique cultural achievements created by the Chinese people over thousands of years. The agreements signed between the Polish People's Republic and the People's Republic of China on the exchange of cultural, scientific and artistic workers, students, theatrical troupes and films are of great significance in this regard. We in Poland have more than once admired the performances of Chinese actors, especially the performances of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the China Youth Art Troupe. The China Youth Art Troupe participated in the Fifth World Youth and Student Festival in Warsaw this year, and showed hundreds of thousands of Warsaw residents and young peace fighters from all over the world the outstanding achievements of ancient and rich Chinese culture, as well as the delightful modern artistic creations of the free Chinese people.

    The visit of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble to the People's Republic of China is a major event in the political and cultural life of the Polish people and their armed forces.

    Everyone in Poland understands that our visit to the People's Republic of China is not a matter of courtesy, but a visit from friends to friends. This visit is another convincing manifestation of the close friendship between our two peoples. The soldiers of the Polish People's Republic Army were very pleased to hear the news of the song and dance ensemble's visit to China. They are very familiar with the outstanding achievements of the free and talented Chinese people in building socialism, and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, are fighting for their own happiness, for the consolidation of independence and peace.

    In the cultural centers of our troops – "Officers' Homes," clubs and "Red Corners," soldiers, officers and their families have broad access to detailed information about China's political, economic and cultural life.

    The song and dance troupes of the military regions, the air force and the navy, as well as many amateur art groups, are proud to have Chinese works in their performance programs. Our soldiers always welcome Chinese works very warmly.

    It is also not without significance that we emphasize here the special role played by the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army during its visit to Poland. Its performances for Polish army audiences not only promoted moving dances and melodious Chinese folk songs among Polish soldiers, but also aroused their interest in the poetry and prose of Chinese writers.

    Currently, some cultural and educational centers in our Polish army are preparing to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble is very honored to be able to participate in the celebration of this happy festival in Beijing.

    We feel very happy to be able to express, together with all the Chinese people, in your beautiful country, our firm will to strive for our common ideal – to strive for peace and socialism. The outstanding national leaders of the People's Republic of China – Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, particularly pointed out this great significance in their talks with the leaders and representatives of the song and dance ensemble.

    We express our deep gratitude to the Chinese people, their party and government for the welcome we have received in China – for the warm and cordial hospitality, for the fraternal friendship.

    Our song and dance ensemble is eager to complete the important task entrusted to us by the Polish people, the Polish United Workers' Party and the Government of the Polish People's Republic as quickly as possible.

    According to our wishes, we believe that we will live up to this great trust. We will use singing and dancing to serve this great cause – the close friendship between our two peoples.

    为了永恒的友谊
    波兰军队总政治部文化部部长  兹·沃尔瓦中校
    中华人民共和国距我们有数千公里之遥，但是中国人民对我们说来是亲近的、友爱的。我们走着同一条道路，我们的目标是一致的，我们为了共同的事业——巩固和平和建设社会主义——而斗争。
    我们对于伟大的中国人民——世界上最美丽的人民怀着深刻的同情和尊敬。我们以非常愉快的心情注视着我们中国同志的胜利——起初是人民革命的胜利，其后是抗美援朝的胜利；现在我们则注视着中国人民在伟大的和平建设战线上的斗争。我们同中国人民发展着友好合作和经济联系，加强着文化合作的纽带。
    波兰人民及其武装力量很感兴趣地认识中国人民几千年来所创造的优美的、独特的文化成就。波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国所签订的关于交换文化、科学和艺术工作者、留学生、剧团和影片的协定，在这方面具有很大的意义。我们在波兰曾不止一次地赞赏中国演员的表演，特别是中国人民解放军歌舞团和中国青年艺术团的演出。中国青年艺术团今年曾在华沙参加第五届世界青年与学生联欢节，并向数十万华沙居民以及从全世界来的青年和平战士显示了古老而丰富的中国文化的优秀成就，以及自由的中国人民的令人欢乐的现代艺术创作。
    波兰军队歌舞团来访问中华人民共和国，对于波兰人民及其武装力量的政治生活和文化生活来说，是一件大事情。
    波兰所有的人都明白，我们来到中华人民共和国并不是一种礼节上的访问，而是朋友来访问朋友。这种访问是我们两国人民亲密无间的友好关系的又一次令人信服的表现。波兰人民共和国军队的战士们听到歌舞团到中国来的消息是很愉快的。他们很熟悉自由的和有才干的中国人民在建设社会主义中的杰出成就，中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，正在为自己的幸福、为巩固独立和和平而进行斗争。
    在我国的部队的文化中心——“军官之家”、俱乐部和“红角”里，战士、军官和他们的家属具有详细地了解中国的政治、经济和文化生活情形的广泛可能。
    军区、空军和海军部队歌舞团以及许多业余艺术团体所引为光荣的，是在自己的表演节目里有中国的作品。我们的战士对中国作品永远是非常热情地欢迎的。
    我们在这儿强调指出中国人民解放军歌舞团在波兰访问期间所起的特殊作用，也不是没有意义的。它为波兰军队观众的演出，不仅促进了在波兰战士之间推广动人的舞蹈和悦耳的中国民歌，而且也使他们对中国作家的诗歌和散文发生了兴趣。
    目前，我们波兰军队中的一些文化教育中心都在准备庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年。波兰军队歌舞团感到非常荣幸的是能在北京参加这个愉快节日的庆祝典礼。
    能够同全中国人民一道在你们这个美丽的国家里来表示为争取我们的共同理想——争取和平和社会主义而斗争的坚强意志，我们是感到十分幸福的。中华人民共和国杰出的国家领导人员——中华人民共和国副主席朱德同志和中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志在同歌舞团的领导人和代表们的谈话中，特别指出了这一重大意义。
    我们为我们在中国所受到的欢迎——为热情而殷勤的招待、为兄弟般的友谊，向中国人民、他们的党和政府致以深深的谢意。
    我们歌舞团热望着能够比较快地完成波兰人民、波兰统一工人党和波兰人民共和国政府所交给我们的这个重大任务。
    依照我们的心愿，我们相信我们将不辜负这个伟大的信托。我们将以歌唱和舞蹈来为这一伟大事业——我们两国人民的亲密友谊而服务。
