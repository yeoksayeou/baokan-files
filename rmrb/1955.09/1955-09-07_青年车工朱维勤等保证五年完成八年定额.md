    Youth Lathe Operators Zhu Weiqin and Others Guarantee to Complete Eight Years' Quota in Five Years
    Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande, labor models and outstanding young lathe operators from Dalian Shipbuilding Company, recently proposed a plan to complete eight years of production quotas during the first Five-Year Plan, guarantee 100% product quality, and avoid any accidents, in order to accelerate the great socialist construction of the motherland. Now, they are working hard every moment to realize this plan, and each of them strives to complete more than thirteen hours of production quota in eight hours per shift.
    For more than five years, Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande have been working in shifts on an old electric lathe, overfulfilling the state plan every month and maintaining excellent product quality. By the end of June this year, they had completed four years of production quotas in the first two and a half years of the first Five-Year Plan.
    Their main method of consistently overfulfilling production plans is to not waste a minute of production time and save auxiliary production time. By preparing tools in advance, they can save more than 30 minutes of production time in one shift. They also receive tasks in advance and review drawings to solve technical problems in production in a timely manner. Therefore, auxiliary production time is greatly shortened. Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande also pay attention to utilizing the potential of the lathe and earnestly save during production. After research, they increased the four belts of the lathe to six and increased the pulley by fifty millimeters, increasing the speed from 300 revolutions per minute to 400 revolutions per minute, and increasing the cutting depth by about two millimeters, increasing the lathe production efficiency by more than 40%. They used a magnet steel knife for six years. Each month, the two of them should receive twelve knives, but they often only receive seven or eight.
    Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande also compete and help each other in production. For example, when Zhu Weiqin was turning Walo seats, he studied the use of three-edged tools to increase production efficiency by more than double. When Zhang Liande took over the shift, Zhu Weiqin introduced this experience to him. They often exchange production experience and create favorable production conditions for those taking over. Recently, Zhu Weiqin's apprentice, Chi Detian, completed his apprenticeship. In the future, the three of them will take turns watching a machine. When setting the plan this time, Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande both expressed that they would further consolidate and develop their unity and work together to ensure the completion of the plan.

### 青年车工朱维勤等保证五年完成八年定额

    青年车工朱维勤等保证五年完成八年定额
    大连造船公司劳动模范、优秀的青年车工朱维勤和张连德，为了加速祖国伟大的社会主义建设，最近提出了在第一个五年计划期间完成八年生产定额，保证产品质量达到百分之百，并且不出一次事故的计划。现在，他们每时每刻都在为实现这一计划而努力，每班每人都争取在八小时内完成十三小时以上的生产定额。
    五年多来，朱维勤和张连德在一台旧式电动机车床上轮班生产，月月超额完成国家计划，一直保持了优良的产品质量。到今年六月底，在第一个五年计划头两年半的时间内，他们已经完成了四年的生产定额。
    他们一贯超额完成生产计划的主要方法，是不浪费一分钟的生产时间，节约生产辅助时间。由于提前准备好刀具，在一个工班里，他们就能节省下三十多分钟的生产时间。他们还提前领活，进行审阅图纸等工作，及时解决生产中的技术问题。因此，生产辅助时间大大缩短。朱维勤和张连德也注意发挥车床潜力，并在生产中认真节约。他们经过研究把车床的四根皮带增加到六根，又把皮带轮加大了五十公厘，使转数由每分钟三百转提高到四百转，使吃刀量增加了两公厘左右，把车床生产效率提高百分之四十以上。他们的一把磁钢刀用了六年。每个月他们两个人应该领十二把刀，而他们经常只领七八把。
    朱维勤和张连德在生产中还展开竞赛，并互相帮助。如朱维勤车瓦罗座子时，研究使用三刃刀具，提高生产效率一倍多。张连德接班时，朱维勤就把这一经验介绍给他。他们经常交流生产经验，互相为接班的人创造有利的生产条件。最近，朱维勤的徒弟迟德田满徒了，今后他们三个人要轮班看一台机器。这次订计划的时候，朱维勤和张连德都表示要更加巩固和发展他们之间的团结，共同努力，保证完成计划。
