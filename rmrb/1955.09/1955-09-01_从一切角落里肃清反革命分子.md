The full crimes of the counter-revolutionary assassination group lurking in the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, have been completely exposed. The criminals Wang P昌i, Liu Zheng, Li Zongquan, and others in this counter-revolutionary group wore the solemn and sacred guise of physicians who "save lives and heal the wounded," but in reality, they were engaged in the heinous crime of secretly harming people's lives. Their assassination targets were not only Communists, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary soldiers, but also ordinary workers, peasants, kind mothers and children, and even newborn babies. Workers and peasants use their hard work to produce food and goods for the human world, creating wealth and civilization; counter-revolutionaries also enjoy this wealth and civilization, but they want to murder the laboring people who nurture them! Mothers devote countless efforts to raising children and nurturing the growth of future generations, but counter-revolutionaries take advantage of mothers' and children's illnesses and dangers to secretly murder them! The counter-revolutionary elements adopted all sorts of despicable and vicious criminal methods, such as treating serious illnesses lightly, delaying treatment of emergencies, prolonging treatment, and even prescribing wrong prescriptions and performing wrong surgeries, determined to put patients to death. They deliberately cut open patients' bladders and ureters, turning curable diseases into incurable ones. When patients were dying, they would say, "Tell me when they're dead!" These bandits who carried out secret assassinations under the cloak of physicians have completely lost their humanity and human conscience. Their behavior not only defiles the sacred word "physician," but also defiles the proud word "human." Gorky once said that comparing them is even an insult to typhoid lice. The despicable filth and cruel wickedness of these assassins and murderers is something that no kind person can imagine. They are the dregs of humanity and the enemies of the people.

Most counter-revolutionary bandits come from the reactionary exploiting classes, and they have always bullied and exploited the people. Their happiness has always been built on the bones of the people. When the people, through bloodshed and sacrifice, gained liberation and began to build a truly human life for themselves, these die-hard elements of the doomed reactionary class were unwilling to accept the demise of their class. They adopted despicable double-dealing tactics to infiltrate the ranks of the people, determined to be enemies of the people and sabotage all the great undertakings the people were engaged in. In all the work posts they had seized, they sought and created any exploitable gaps and opportunities to harm the people and destroy everything that the people had created and were creating. Everything that people cherish and love is what they hate and despise, and everything is the object and goal of their sabotage and assassination. People love the volunteers and the People's Liberation Army who defend their happiness; counter-revolutionary bandits Wang Pichang and Liu Zheng used distilled water instead of penicillin to inject these revolutionary soldiers, creating chronic death. Hundreds of millions of people demand a peaceful and happy life and peaceful construction of their own happy life, but counter-revolutionary bandits wholeheartedly look forward to a third world war, look forward to a destructive atomic war, and attempt to rebuild their bloody kingdom in the ruins. When millions of people in Wuhan were fighting floods intensely, counter-revolutionary bandits tried every possible means to sabotage flood prevention and damage dam projects, attempting to kill hundreds of thousands of people. The people of the whole country are looking forward to the rapid completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and are proud of building this unprecedentedly huge bridge project, but counter-revolutionary bandits regard it as a thorn in their side and a thorn in their eye, and try their best to destroy it by various means. The peasants worked hard for a year, harvesting crops, and counter-revolutionary bandits set fires to burn them. Workers sweat profusely underground to mine coal, bringing warmth and power to people, but counter-revolutionary bandits tried every means to explode mines and kill coal miners. Even the counter-revolutionary bandits' own family members, as long as they don't follow them, they will kill them all. Like snakes and scorpions, they have no blood, only venom; they sting and bite people, poisoning people's lives. They concentratedly reflect the reactionary instincts of all reactionary classes. The greater the victory of the people, the more crazy they become, and the more unreservedly their reactionary instincts will be revealed.

The counter-revolutionary case in the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture tells us once again: the people of the whole country must work together to thoroughly eliminate all these counter-revolutionary bandits. If the counter-revolutionary elements are not eliminated for a single day, our lives and happiness will not be fully guaranteed for a single day. Some well-meaning people originally thought that if I don't touch the counter-revolutionary elements, the counter-revolutionary elements will presumably not come to touch me. But the opposite is true. If you don't touch the counter-revolutionary elements, the counter-revolutionary elements will definitely come to touch you. Housewives and children who were treated in the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture did not offend the counter-revolutionary elements, but counter-revolutionary bandits such as Wang Pichang and Liu Zheng did not let them go, and they wanted to kill them all the same. From this, it can be seen that it is impossible to peacefully coexist and not disturb each other with counter-revolutionary elements. Every kind person must learn a lesson from this, actively and voluntarily participate in the struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionary elements, regard this struggle as something closely related to their own lives and future, and regard reporting counter-revolutionary elements as their bounden duty. As long as the people of our country are all vigilant and act, a handful of counter-revolutionary bandits will no longer find a place to hide. In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, many masses in various places have spontaneously risen up to report and capture counter-revolutionary elements. Party and government leading organs at all levels should use the various crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements that have been exposed to educate the masses, continuously improve the political consciousness of the masses, and mobilize all the masses to participate in the struggle. Only in this way can we thoroughly and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements and guarantee the victory of the socialist construction cause we are undertaking.

The counter-revolutionary case in the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture also repeatedly proves that revolutionary workers in various enterprises must work harder to learn and master technology so that they will not be deceived again; at the same time, they should pay attention to strengthening ideological and political work and improving the ideological and political level of the broad masses of workers and staff. At the same time, old technicians must be treated differently; we must not relax our vigilance and struggle against counter-revolutionary elements because we want to unite old technicians. Zhang Zhengquan, the former president of the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, completely forgot about this aspect. He didn't not know the criminal history of counter-revolutionary bandits such as Wang Pichang and Liu Zheng, but he was not at all vigilant, and even personally promoted these counter-revolutionary bandits to important positions. After the counter-revolutionary bandit Liu Zheng killed six people in two months, he not only did not seriously investigate the accident, but said, "Liu Zheng is our object of unity, and whoever hinders unity will be fully responsible." Many employees have already called the surgery department controlled by Wang Pichang, Liu Zheng, etc. the "killing department," but he explained, "Which hospital doesn't have deaths? We are not an insurance shop here." This president, who had completely lost his revolutionary vigilance, objectively connived at and shielded counter-revolutionary elements. He committed a crime against the Party, the people, and the country. The Party and government leading organs and supervision departments of Hebei Province and Shijiazhuang Prefecture have the responsibility to thoroughly investigate and deal with this incident, in order to educate all revolutionary workers and all Communists, and thoroughly correct the bad tendency of leaders not studying technology and not caring about politics.

The counter-revolutionary case in the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture tells us once again that counter-revolutionary elements have used the double-dealing tactics of pretending to be revolutionary to infiltrate every corner of our revolutionary camp. They have even turned our medical institutions for treating illnesses and saving lives into secret places where they can assassinate the people and assassinate revolutionary workers. This situation must absolutely not be allowed to continue. In order to change this situation, we must carry out the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements more widely, so that this struggle can be comprehensively and deeply extended to every corner, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly investigate and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, so that these hateful enemies of the people can confess their crimes before the people.

    从一切角落里肃清反革命分子
    潜藏在河北省石家庄专区第一人民医院的反革命暗害集团的全部罪行已经被彻底揭穿了。这个反革命集团的王丕昌、刘正、李宗泉等罪犯，披着救命治病的庄严神圣的医师的外衣，实际上却在进行着暗害人命的万恶勾当。他们暗害的对象不仅是共产党人、革命干部、革命军人，而且是普通的工人、农民、善良的母亲和孩子，以至新生的婴儿。工人和农民用自己的辛勤劳动为人类世界生产吃的用的，创造财富和文明，反革命分子也在享受着这些财富和文明，但是他们却要谋害这些哺育他们的劳动人民！母亲们为着抚养孩子，为着人类的后代子孙的成长，付出不知多少的心血和精力，但是反革命分子却趁着母亲和孩子们的病痛和危难，暗中杀害她们！反革命分子们采用了重病轻医、急症缓医、拖延不医以至错开药方、错动手术等各种卑鄙毒辣的罪恶手段，硬要置病人于死地。他们故意把病人的膀胱割破，输尿管割断，使可治的病变成不治之症。在病人垂危的时候，他们说“死了再告诉我”！这些在医师的外衣遮盖之下进行暗害勾当的匪徒，完全丧失了人性，丧失了人类的天良。他们的行为不仅沾辱了“医师”这个神圣的字眼，而且也沾辱了“人”这个可骄傲的字眼。高尔基就曾说过，同他们比较，甚至于要侮辱了伤寒症的虱子。这些暗害分子和杀人凶手的卑鄙龌龊和残忍恶毒，是任何善良的人所完全不能想像的。他们是人类的渣滓，人民的公敌。
    反革命匪徒多半出身于反动的剥削阶级，他们一贯欺侮和压榨人民。他们的幸福一向是建筑在人民的白骨之上的。在人民经过流血牺牲而得到解放，开始为自己建设真正的人的生活的时候，注定要灭亡的反动阶级中的这批死硬分子不甘心自己阶级的灭亡，他们采用卑劣的两面手法打入了人民内部，决意与人民为敌，破坏人民所进行的一切伟大的事业。他们在自己所窃取到的一切工作岗位上，寻觅和制造任何可以利用的空隙和机会来谋害人民，破坏人民所创造出来和正在创造的一切。凡是人们所珍贵的和热爱的，统统都是他们所憎恶的和仇视的，统统都是他们破坏和谋害的对象和目标。人们热爱保卫自己幸福的志愿军、解放军，反革命匪徒王丕昌、刘正就用蒸馏水代替盘尼西林来给这些革命军人注射，制造慢性的死亡。亿万人民要求安居乐业，和平地建设自己的幸福生活，反革命匪徒却一心盼望着第三次世界大战，盼望着毁灭性的原子战争，企图在废墟中重新建立他们血腥的王国。武汉市成百万人民紧张地同洪水搏斗的时候，反革命匪徒就千方百计地破坏防汛，破坏堤坝工程，企图致百十万人于死命。全国人民都在盼望武汉长江大桥迅速修成，并且为建设这一空前巨大的桥梁工程而自豪，反革命匪徒却把它当作目中刺、眼中钉，极力要用各种方法把它毁掉。农民辛辛苦苦劳动了一年，收割起庄稼，反革命匪徒纵火加以烧毁。工人们淌着大汗在地下采煤，为人们带来温暖和动力，反革命匪徒却想尽办法爆炸矿山，杀害煤矿工人。甚至反革命匪徒自己的家属，只要不跟着他们走的，他们也要一一杀绝。他们像蛇蝎一样没有血液，只有毒液，碰着人就螫一下，咬一口，毒害人命。他们集中地反映了一切反动阶级的反动本能。人民的胜利愈大，他们就愈疯狂，他们的反动本能就愈要无保留地显露出来。
    石家庄专区第一人民医院的反革命案件又一次告诉我们：全国人民必须大家一齐动手，彻底肃清这一切反革命匪徒，反革命分子一天不肃清，我们的生命和幸福就一天得不到完全的保障。一些好心的人原来认为，我不碰反革命分子，反革命分子想必不会来碰我。而事实恰恰相反，你不碰反革命分子，反革命分子却一定要来碰你。在石家庄专区第一人民医院治病的家庭主妇和孩子们并没有得罪反革命分子，但王丕昌和刘正这些反革命匪徒却没有放过他们，一样要杀害他们。由此可见，同反革命分子是不能和平共处和互不惊扰的。每一个善良的人都必须从这里取得教训，积极地主动地参加肃清暗藏反革命分子的斗争，把这一斗争看作同自己的生活和前途密切相关的事情，把检举反革命分子看作是自己应尽的责任。只要我们全国人民都警觉起来了，行动起来了，一小撮反革命匪徒就再也找不到容身之地。在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，各地已经有许多群众自动起来检举和捕捉反革命分子。各级党政领导机关应该运用已经揭发出来的反革命分子的各种罪行来教育群众，不断地提高群众的政治觉悟，发动所有的群众起来参加斗争。必须这样，我们才能干净彻底地肃清一切反革命分子，保证我们正在进行的社会主义建设事业的胜利。
    石家庄专区第一人民医院的反革命案件还重复地证明，各种企业中的革命工作人员必须加紧努力学习和掌握技术，使自己不致再受人欺骗；同时注意加强思想和政治工作，提高广大职工群众的思想和政治水平。同时对于旧技术人员，则必须予以分别对待；不能因为要团结旧技术人员而放松了对反革命分子的警惕和斗争。石家庄专区第一人民医院前任院长张政权恰恰是完全忘记了这一方面。他并非不知道王丕昌、刘正等反革命匪徒的罪恶历史，而他居然毫无警惕，甚至亲手提拔这些反革命匪徒担任重要的职务。在反革命匪徒刘正两个月内害死六条人命之后，他不但不认真追查事故，反而说“刘正是我们的团结对象，谁妨碍了团结谁负完全责任”。不少职工已经称王丕昌、刘正等把持的外科为“杀人科”，而他却解释说：“那个医院不死人？我们这里不是保险铺。”这个完全丧失了革命警惕性的院长，客观上是纵容和包庇了反革命分子。他对党、对人民、对国家都犯了罪。河北省和石家庄专区的党政领导机关和监察部门有责任彻底查究和处理这一事件，以此教育所有的革命工作人员和所有的共产党员，彻底纠正领导人员不学习技术和不关心政治的不良倾向。
    石家庄专区第一人民医院的反革命案件再一次告诉我们，反革命分子已经用伪装革命的两面派手法打入了我们革命阵营的各个角落，他们甚至把我们治病救人的医疗机关变成了他们借以暗杀人民和暗杀革命工作人员的秘密场所。这种情形是绝对不能让它继续存在下去的。为了改变这种状况，我们必须把肃清反革命分子的斗争更加广泛地开展起来，使这个斗争全面地深入到一切角落，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地清查出一切暗藏的反革命分子，使这些可恶的人民公敌在人民面前服罪。
