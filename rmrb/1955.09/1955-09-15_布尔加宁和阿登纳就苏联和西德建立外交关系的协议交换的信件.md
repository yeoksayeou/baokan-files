Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th (TASS): The full text of the letters exchanged between N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, is as follows:

    Moscow
    To His Excellency Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany:
    Mr. Federal Chancellor, I have the honor to inform you that, in accordance with the agreement reached by the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany during the negotiations, the Soviet Government has decided to establish diplomatic relations with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and to exchange diplomatic representatives at the level of Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.
    The Soviet Government expresses its deep conviction that the diplomatic relations now being established will help develop mutual understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, in the interest of peace and European security.
    The Soviet Government’s starting point in this regard is that the establishment and development of normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will promote the resolution of unresolved issues concerning Germany as a whole, thereby contributing to the solution of the German people's primary national problem - the reunification of the German democratic state.
    I consider it necessary to declare here that the agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany shall enter into force upon approval by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
    Mr. Chancellor, please accept my highest regards.

    莫斯科
    德意志联邦共和国总理康拉德·阿登纳先生阁下：
    联邦总理先生，由于苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团在谈判过程中达成的协议，我荣幸地奉告你：苏联政府已经决定同德意志联邦共和国政府建立外交关系，并且互派特命全权大使级的外交代表。
    苏联政府表示深信，现在正在建立中的外交关系将有助于发展苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的相互谅解和合作，以利于和平和欧洲安全。
    苏联政府在这方面的出发点是，苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的正常关系的建立和发展，将促成有关整个德国的尚未解决的问题的解决，从而将有助于解决德国人民的全民族的主要问题——重新统一德意志民主国家。
    我认为必须在此声明，关于苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系的协议一经苏联最高苏维埃主席团批准，即将生效。
    总理先生，请你接受我的崇高的敬意。
