Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 11th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency on the 10th, the spokesman of the Supreme Command of the Lao Fighting Forces issued a statement refuting the absurd reports published by some foreign news agencies at the end of August that the Lao Fighting Forces had attacked Lao Kingdom forces in certain strongholds in Sam Neua province, and that conflicts had occurred between the two sides in Thakhek province.

The statement pointed out that the fact is that since the beginning of June 1955, the Lao Kingdom government had dispatched a large number of reinforcements to Sam Neua province, including the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 6th, 7th, and 8th Infantry Battalions. In fact, these troops attacked and occupied eleven locations in the Muong Bon area of Sam Neua province.

The statement added that the Lao Fighting Forces correctly fulfilled the Geneva Accords and, together with Vietnamese volunteer personnel, completely withdrew from the ten provinces of Laos three days before the deadline. Therefore, the rumors about the Lao Fighting Forces attacking Thakhek province are merely providing an excuse for the Kingdom's local authorities to use armed forces to intimidate and suppress former resistance personnel and stifle the people's democratic freedoms.

The statement pointed out that the US imperialists and their lackeys slander the Lao Fighting Forces in order to cover up the armed attacks carried out by the Lao Kingdom's army, and to prepare public opinion and create conditions for launching larger-scale attacks to eliminate the Lao Fighting Forces. They are also attempting to use the Manila Treaty Organization to interfere in Laos.

The spokesman, in the name of the representatives of the Supreme Command of the Lao Fighting Forces, solemnly refuted these slanders and fabrications and lodged a protest.

    寮国战斗部队总司令部发言人发表声明
    驳斥所谓寮国部队进攻王国部队的谰言
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南通讯社十日讯：寮国战斗部队总司令部发言人发表了一项声明，驳斥八月底一些外国通讯社所发表的关于寮国战斗部队曾进攻桑怒省内某些据点的老挝王国部队、以及双方曾在他曲省发生冲突的荒谬消息。
    声明指出，事实是，自从一九五五年六月初以来，老挝王国政府曾派遣大量增援部队进入桑怒省，其中包括第一伞兵营及第六、第七和第八步兵营等。事实上这些部队进攻和占领了桑怒省芒奔地区的十一个地方。
    声明又说，寮国战斗部队正确地履行日内瓦协定，同越南志愿人员在限期之前三天就完全撤出了老挝的十个省份。因此，关于寮国战斗部队进攻他曲省的谣言，只是为王国地方当局提供借口，来使用武装部队恐吓和镇压前抗战人员和绞杀人民的民主自由。
    声明指出，美帝国主义者和它的仆从诬蔑寮国战斗部队，是为了掩盖老挝王国军队进行的武装进攻，并且准备舆论和创造条件，以便发动更大规模的进攻来消灭寮国战斗部队。他们还企图利用马尼拉条约组织来干涉老挝。
    发言人以寮国战斗部队总司令部代表的名义，郑重地驳斥这些诽谤和捏造，并且提出抗议。
