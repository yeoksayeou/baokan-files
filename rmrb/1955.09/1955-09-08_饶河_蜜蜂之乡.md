    Raohe—Hometown of Honeybees
    Yao Zhong; Wang Jihou
    In Raohe County, Heilongjiang Province, on the northeastern border of our country, almost every village has rows of neat beehives shining in the sun; whether on the banks of the large and small rivers covered with lush willow trees, or in the sea of ​​colorful and gorgeous flowers, the buzzing of bees can be heard everywhere—people who enter the countryside of Raohe feel like they have entered the "hometown of honeybees."

    Raohe is a place rich in honey production. There are many kinds of honey produced here, including linden honey, willow honey, wildflower honey, broom honey, and baoma zi honey. The most famous one is linden honey, which is pure white in color, thick in winter and summer, sweet in taste, and nutritious. Its output is also very high. Each box of bees can produce 80 to more than 100 jin in normal years, and the output of this honey accounts for 60 percent of the total output of the county.

    Honey is one of the special products of our country. In addition to being used for food and for making various foods, it can also be used to prepare various medicinal materials. It itself has a high nutritional value, which can increase appetite, strengthen gastrointestinal digestion, and promote physical health.

    In addition to honey, each box of bees can also produce about three jin of beeswax every year. Beeswax is not only an indispensable raw material for developing beekeeping and manufacturing honeycomb foundations, but also for preparing medicinal materials and ointments.

    Although beekeeping has been practiced in Raohe County for a long time, the beekeeping industry has only prospered since liberation. In the past, most of the bees here were monopolized by a few "big families"; and because the reactionaries indiscriminately cut down forests and forest fires occurred continuously, many flowers and trees were severely damaged, hindering the development of the beekeeping industry. At that time, there was a song that said: "Raohe is full of flowers, which flower has no beeswax? Now that the flowers and trees are burned and cut down, the bees have followed suit." After liberation, the monopolized beekeeping industry also returned to the people. The Party and the government paid great attention to the development of the beekeeping industry, adopted measures to protect forests and prevent fires, and prohibited the felling of flowering trees. They also promptly supplied the beekeeping industry with the wood and other materials it needed. Supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned native product companies also promoted honey for the beekeeping masses at reasonable prices, eliminating the intermediate exploitation of private merchants. In addition, the government has gradually guided the beekeeping industry onto the road of cooperation and provided technical guidance and assistance. Up to now, the number of bee farms in the county has increased from eight in the past to twenty-eight (seven of which are state-owned); almost every village has scattered beekeepers.

    With the development of the beekeeping industry, honey production has also increased year by year. Last year alone, the native product company purchased more than 170,000 jin of honey; and the number of bees increased by more than 300 boxes. This year, the Raohe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has paid more attention to the leadership of the beekeeping industry, and put forward the policy of "combining bee harvesting with development," requiring that this year to develop to two thousand four hundred and fifteen boxes of bees (a total of more than five hundred boxes were developed this year).

    Although the linden flowers were in full bloom during the rainy season this year, honey production was not affected much. Judging from the honey production during the spring willow honey season and the linden honey season, a bumper harvest is already certain. Now the entire forest is filled with a fragrant atmosphere. The honeycomb holes of many bee farms are already full of honey. Soon, the pure white honey will be transported to the interior of the motherland.

    饶河——蜜蜂之乡
    姚忠?　王吉厚
    在祖国东北边境的黑龙江省饶河县，几乎到每个村庄都可以看见一座座整齐的蜂房在阳光下闪亮着；不管是在那覆盖着柳树浓荫的大小河川的两岸，还是在那各色艳丽的鲜花的海洋里，到处都可以听到蜜蜂的嗡嗡声——人们一走进饶河的农村，就有进入“蜜蜂之乡”的感觉。
    饶河，是盛产蜂蜜的地方。这里所产的蜂蜜种类极多，有椴树蜜、柳树蜜、草花蜜、帚条蜜、宝马子蜜等。最出名的一种是椴树蜜，它的色泽洁白，冬夏凝稠，味甘美，富有滋养。它的产量也很高，每箱蜜蜂一般年景可产八十到一百多斤，全县这种蜂蜜的产量占总产量的百分之六十。
    蜂蜜，是祖国的特产之一，它除了可供人民食用和制造各种食品之外，还可配制各种药材。它本身含有很高的营养价值，能够增进食欲，加强肠胃消化，促进身体健康。
    除蜂蜜外，每箱蜜蜂每年还可出产三斤左右的蜂蜡。蜂蜡不仅是发展养蜂业制造巢础所不可缺少的原料，更可以配制药材、药膏等。
    饶河县虽然很早就养蜂，但养蜂业是从解放以后才开始繁荣的。过去，这里的蜜蜂大部分被几户“大家”所垄断；并且由于反动派对森林滥砍滥伐，山火不断发生，许多花木遭到了严重的损坏，妨碍了养蜂业的发展。当时流传着一首歌说：“饶河遍地尽是花，哪朵花上没蜜蜡？如今花树烧砍净，蜜蜂跟着败了家。”解放以后，被垄断的养蜂业也回到了人民手里。党和政府十分关心养蜂业的发展，采取了护林防火和禁止砍伐开花树木的措施，及时供应了养蜂业所需的木板等物资，供销社和国营土产公司也以合理的价格为养蜂群众推销蜂蜜，免除私商的中间剥削。另外，政府还逐步引导养蜂业走上合作化的道路，并在技术上加以指导和帮助。到目前为止，全县的蜂场已由过去的八个发展到二十八个（其中七个是国营的）；零散的养蜂户几乎村村都有。
    随着养蜂业的发展，蜂蜜的产量也逐年提高，去年，仅土产公司收购的蜂蜜就有十七万多斤；蜂子增殖了三百多箱。今年，中共饶河县委会更加注意了养蜂业的领导，提出了“割蜂同发展相结合”的方针，要求今年发展到二千四百一十五箱蜜蜂（今年共发展五百多箱）。
    今年椴树花盛开的时候虽然正在雨季，但酿蜜并没有受到什么影响，根据春季柳树蜜期的酿蜜情况和椴树蜜期的情况来看，丰收是已可肯定的了。现在整个林间充溢着清香气息。许多蜂场的蜂箱巢孔，已酿满了蜂蜜。不久，那洁白的蜂蜜将源源地运往祖国内地。
