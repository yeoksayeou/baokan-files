    Learning from the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble
    Li Guoquan, Standing Council Member of the Chinese Musicians Association
    Just as the Chinese people are joyfully welcoming the great festival—National Day, the heroic Polish people have sent their outstanding performing arts troupe to China for performances and will spend this meaningful festival with us. This makes us very happy. In the past, the visit and performance of the Mazowsze Polish Song and Dance Ensemble to our country deepened our understanding of the Polish people, and we also deeply fell in love with the wonderful art of the Polish people. We know that even our primary school students like to sing the Polish folk song "Little Cuckoo." This visit and performance of the Polish People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble to our country will enable us to understand the Polish people more deeply and love the art of the Polish people. The brotherly friendship between our two countries will inevitably be further consolidated.
    We will never forget the successful performances of the Polish People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble. First, I would like to mention the male chorus of the song and dance ensemble. Their singing not only expresses a majestic spirit, but also expresses beautiful and lyrical characteristics. Every song has left a deep impression on us. "Song of the Motherland" (composed by Zawadzki) gives people a solemn feeling and evokes people's infinite love for the motherland. In the performance of "The Polish Revolution Song of 1905," we seemed to see the powerful ranks of the Polish people fighting for national liberation decades ago marching, which made people feel awe. "The Oka River" composed by Ratkowski is a beautiful and moving song. It describes the soldiers of the Kosciuszko First Division stationed on the banks of the Oka River in the Soviet Union. Because the scenery of this area is similar to the scenery on both sides of the Vistula River in Poland, it aroused the soldiers' nostalgia for their motherland. At the beginning of this song with rich national characteristics, the stringed instruments and harp of the orchestra gently played a beautiful prelude like a picture. Then the chorus sang touching songs, which could not help but remind us of how beautiful the Polish land should be! A feature of this wonderful song is that it does not end with a diminuendo, but with a high-pitched and powerful singing. I think this treatment is in line with the mood of the soldiers. "The Reed Flute" composed by Olov is also a very popular program. The audience repeatedly asked for it to be performed again. The characteristic of this song is that it is brisk and lively. Soldiers often hum it when marching. They said: This song is beautiful and moving and can tempt everything around. If birds and beasts understand human nature, they will march with the soldiers. Indeed, this song is so wonderful. They sing so happily, singing a paragraph and blowing a paragraph, and blowing a paragraph and singing another paragraph. It simply sings the beauty and joy of life itself. I really want to learn this song quickly and sing it with them.
    "Mountain People Herding Sheep" (composed by Kryuchnyuk) is also a touching song. The expressive tenor solo and chorus are combined to express the feelings of the shepherd who is about to go to the mountains and his attachment to his lovely home. Several a cappella choruses, such as "The First Hour" and "Marusya, Don't Go to the Forest!", also fully demonstrated the characteristics of the male chorus. The coordination of the voices is very balanced, so it sounds extremely harmonious. The deep bass voice is especially lovely. In addition, the chorus also sang two Soviet songs that we love – "Moscow-Beijing" and "The Sun Sets". When singing "Moscow-Beijing", one section was in Chinese and one section was in Russian, which further showed the mutual understanding and precious friendship between our three countries. They also sang two Chinese songs, one is "Long Live Chairman Mao" and the other is "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army". "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" was sung with vigor, strength, and emotion. Similarly, the singing of "Long Live Chairman Mao" also made us feel very亲切. After the accompaniment of this song was re-orchestrated by them, it also added a lot of color, especially the use of woodwind instruments and pizzicato of violins, which made this song particularly lively.
    In addition, the solos of tenor Pablocki and baritone Watish are also very outstanding. Here I would also like to especially mention the soprano's singing. Swonicka successfully sang the excerpt from the Chinese opera "Chiye River"—"Swallows Go Down to the River to Wash Clothes" (composed by Liang Hanguang). She not only pronounced the words clearly and mastered the Chinese national style, but also expressed the mood of Chinese women who were under feudal oppression in the past, which is very valuable.
    It is gratifying that the song and dance ensemble has a complete symphony orchestra of seventy people. In addition to accompanying the chorus and dance, they also performed orchestra performances separately. They played a dance "Obertas" by the famous Polish composer Stefan Fitelberg, and conductor Adam Wiernik gave an outstanding performance with the musicians of the orchestra with full emotion and sharp movements. Among the seven orchestral programs, we have only heard this one, which makes us feel dissatisfied.
    The biggest feature of the dance program is its strong national style. The "Polonaise Dance" and "Mazurka Dance" arranged according to the music of the great Polish musicians Chopin and Moniuszko will never be forgotten no matter what. After watching such dances, people love the music of Chopin and Moniuszko even more. In addition, the performance of the Chinese folk dance "Picking Tea and Catching Butterflies" was also successful. Although the accompaniment part canceled the accompaniment singing, it did not feel diminished due to the enrichment of the orchestration, but I think that if two characteristic Chinese percussion instruments – a Chinese small drum and a pair of Chinese small gongs – could be used in the orchestration, it would be even better.
    The Polish People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble has several major characteristics: the rich expressiveness of the male chorus, dances with a strong national character, a highly skilled symphony orchestra, and the energetic and lovely performing attitude of the actors. These make the audience offstage unable to help but communicate with them emotionally. In short, the performance of the Polish People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble has a high degree of achievement in both ideology and art. It is by no means accidental that they can receive good reviews in their performances in various countries and be honorably awarded the National First-Class Labor Banner Medal. They have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. They have mastered the artistic creation methods and performing methods of socialist realism excellently. These are all worthy of our Chinese literary and art workers to learn from. (Attached picture)

    向波兰军队歌舞团学习
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　黎国荃
    正值中国人民以极欢快的心情来迎接伟大的节日——国庆节的前夕，英雄的波兰人民派来了他们杰出的艺术表演团来到中国演出，并将和我们一道度过这一有意义的节日，这是使我们十分高兴的。过去波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团到我国的访问演出，使我们对波兰人民有了进一步的了解，同时也深深地爱上了波兰人民的美妙的艺术，我们知道连我国的小学生都喜欢唱“小杜鹃”这支波兰民歌；这次波兰人民共和国军队歌舞团到我国的访问演出，将会使我们更深刻地了解波兰人民，热爱波兰人民的艺术，我们两国之间的兄弟般的友谊，也必将随之更加巩固。
    我们永远不会忘记波兰人民共和国军队歌舞团的成功的演出。首先我想提到歌舞团的男声合唱，他们的演唱，除表现了雄伟的气魄外，还表现了优美抒情的特点，每个歌曲都给我们留下了深刻的印象。“祖国之歌”（萨瓦茨基作曲）给人以庄严的感觉，并唤起人们对祖国的无限热爱心情。在“一九○五年波兰革命之歌”的演唱中，我们好像看到，在数十年前波兰人民为求民族解放而斗争的强大的队伍在行进着，使人肃然起敬。拉特科夫斯基作曲的“俄喀河”是一支优美动人的歌曲，它描写科斯久什科第一师的士兵，驻在苏联境内的俄喀河畔的时候，由于这一带的风景和波兰维斯杜拉河两岸的风景相似，引起了士兵们对祖国的怀念，这支富有民族特色的歌曲一开始就由乐队的弦乐器和竖琴，轻轻地奏出了如图画一般美丽的引子，接着合唱队唱出了感人的歌声，不禁使我们联想到波兰国土该有多么美丽！这首美妙的歌曲有一个特点，即不用渐弱的方法去收尾，而是用高昂有力的歌声来结束，我认为这样的处理，是符合士兵的情绪的。奥鲁夫作曲的“芦笛”也是非常受欢迎的节目，听众一再要求再来一次，这支歌曲的特点是轻快活泼。士兵们在行军时常常哼唱它。他们说：这支歌曲美丽动人，能诱惑周围的一切，如果鸟兽懂得人性的话，它们将会和士兵们一起去行军；的确，这支歌子是这样美妙，他们唱得那么愉快，唱一段吹一段，吹一段又唱一段，简直唱出了生活本身的美好和快活，我真想赶快学会这支歌子跟他们一块去唱。
    “山民赶着羊群”（克留奇纽克作曲）也是一首感人的歌曲，富于表情的男高音领唱和合唱配合在一起，表现出将要到山中去的牧童，对可爱的家园的留恋心情。“第一小时”及“玛露霞，不要到森林去！”几个无伴奏合唱，也都充分地发挥了男声合唱的特点，声部的配合非常均衡，因而听起来和谐极了，深厚的男低音声部特别令人喜爱。另外合唱队还演唱了为我们所喜爱的两支苏联歌曲——“莫斯科—北京”和“太阳落山”，演唱“莫斯科—北京”时，一段用中文，一段用俄文，这更显示了我们三国之间的相互了解和宝贵的友谊。他们还演唱了两首中国歌曲，一首是“万岁毛泽东”，一首是“中国人民解放军进行曲”。“中国人民解放军进行曲”唱得有气魄，有力量，有感情。同样，“万岁毛泽东”的演唱，也使我们感到十分亲切。这支歌曲的伴奏，经过他们从新配器之后，也增色不少，特别是木管乐器和提琴顿音的运用，使得这
  一歌曲格外显得活泼。
    此外，男高音帕布洛茨基和男中音瓦蒂什的独唱也是非常出色的，这里我还想特别提到女高音的演唱。斯沃尼茨卡成功地演唱了中国歌剧“赤叶河”选曲—“燕燕下河洗衣裳”（梁寒光作曲），她不但咬字清楚，掌握了中国的民族风格，同时把中国妇女过去处在封建压迫下的那种心情也表达了出来，这是非常可贵的。
    令人高兴的是，歌舞团中有一个七十人的完整的交响乐队，他们除了为合唱和舞蹈伴奏外，还进行了单独的乐队表演。他们演奏了波兰有名的作曲家斯切法尼·菲杰里别尔格的一段舞曲“奥别尔塔斯”，指挥家阿达姆·维尔尼克，以充沛的感情和俐落的动作，同乐队的音乐家们进行了杰出的表演。在七个管弦乐节目中，我们还只听到这一个，这是使我们感到不满足的地方。
    舞蹈节目的最大特点是有着浓厚的民族风格，根据波兰伟大的音乐家萧邦和莫纽什科的音乐所编排的“波洛乃兹舞”和“玛佐卡舞”，无论如何使人不会忘记。看了这样的舞蹈，就使人更喜爱萧邦和莫纽什科的音乐。此外，中国民间舞蹈“采茶扑蝶”的表演，也是成功的，在伴奏部分虽然取消了伴唱，但由于丰富了配器，所以并未感到减色，但我觉得如果能在配器中使用两件具有特色的中国打击乐器——一个中国小鼓，一对中国小?，那就更好了。
    波兰人民共和国军队歌舞团有几个很大的特点：男声合唱的丰富的表现力，具有浓厚的民族特色的舞蹈，具有高度技巧的交响乐队，演员们的富有朝气的可爱的演出态度，这些，都使得台下的观众不能不和他们在情感上交流起来。总之，波兰人民共和国军队歌舞团的表演，无论在思想性上和艺术性上都有高度的成就，他们能在访问各国演出中获得好评，以及能光荣地获得国家一级劳动旗帜勋章，绝不是偶然的。他们表现出了高度的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神，他们出色地掌握了社会主义现实主义的艺术创作方法和表演方法，这些都是值得我们中国的文艺工作者好好学习的。（附图片）
