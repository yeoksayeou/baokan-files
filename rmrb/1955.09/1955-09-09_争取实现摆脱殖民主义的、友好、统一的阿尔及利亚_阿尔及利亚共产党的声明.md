Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The "New France" weekly published on August 27th the statement of the Algerian Communist Party, titled: "Striving for a Decolonized, Friendly, and Unified Algeria." The full text of the statement is as follows:

Our country, after more than a century of constant resistance to colonial rule, is now at a decisive stage in its history. The national people's movement has never been as powerful as it is now.

Various forms of mass action clearly demonstrate the will of our people to break free from oppression and live a true life.

The vast majority of the Algerian people are no longer willing to be treated as slaves in their own country. They have had enough of colonial rule and all the humiliation and misfortune it brings. They are no longer willing to be excluded from managing their own affairs, they are no longer willing to be farmers without land, workers without relief from unemployment, or wage earners suffering from hunger and hardship.

However, the colonialists, who ruthlessly exploit the people, are panicked by the struggle of the Algerians, and therefore refuse any democratic solution and intensify repression. However, nothing has been able to, and never will be able to, stifle our legitimate national aspirations. Neither the 120,000 troops threatening to wage a real war in our country, nor the state of emergency, nor the sweeps and indiscriminate executions.

The Real Solution

The Algerian Communist Party, the only party that unites Muslim and European workers in its ranks in friendship, has its own program. The ideal of the communists, and of all patriotic people, is true national and social liberation, that is, the establishment of a socialist Algeria where there is no longer exploitation of man by man.

Today, it is the colonial system that shackles any development of our people. Abolishing the colonial system and striving for national liberation is the primary responsibility of all.

The legitimate national aspirations of the vast majority of the Algerian people do not conflict with the interests and future of European or Israeli workers and democrats, who have nothing in common with those who plunder Algeria's wealth - the likes of Bozio, Braschie, Rene Mayer, plus Ben Ghana and Saja. Our country has, in practice, become the common homeland of all its inhabitants over centuries of development. Therefore, the solution cannot be assimilation, which the Algerian people reject, nor can it be "integration" in another form, but respect for our national individuality, the establishment of a democratic republic, and the maintenance of a freely agreed alliance with France on the basis of equality and mutual respect for existing interests.

The Communists also hope to realize the farmers' dream: land to the tillers. The Communists are fighting for land reform, to distribute the land of the big colonialists and the feudal landlords, agents of colonialism, to farmers of all races who have no land or insufficient land.

Preliminary Achievements

The development of the people's struggle has drawn world opinion's attention to the Algerian question. It has forced some French people - especially the Socialists - to recognize that our country has not only social and economic problems, but also political problems. Today we have the opportunity to achieve other successes and deal a decisive blow to colonialism, provided that:

    1. The struggle of the broad masses continues to develop.

    2. The conspiracies of "neo-colonialism" are stopped.

In fact, the French rulers and those who support them are intensifying repression on the one hand, and intensifying efforts to frustrate the courage of the masses, deceive them, and divide the national democratic movement on the other. This is precisely the intention of Soustelle's efforts and his "reform plan." In this regard, the Algerian Communist Party must emphasize the danger of certain nationalist leaders attempting to conduct behind-the-scenes negotiations behind the backs of the people, which can only result in abandoning the people's interests.

    3. The forces of the anti-colonial struggle unite.

Today we must reiterate more forcefully than ever that national liberation is not the exclusive cause of any one party or faction, but the cause of all the people acting in unity. As for us, for many years we have been constantly advocating the unity of Algerians of all races - communists, nationalists, organized or non-partisan democrats - to form a democratic national front, acting in unison to liberate Algeria from colonial rule.

To this end, the Communist Party declares its solidarity with all those who understand the need to unite Algerians to form a broad front of anti-colonial struggle. It puts forward a minimum program for the present, in order to unite all those who, to varying degrees, oppose the colonial system today, thereby strengthening the unity of the national movement. It announces its willingness to meet with representatives of other nationalist organizations (in our country) to jointly discuss this minimum program and study ways to implement it.

The Basis for Common Action at Present

At this stage, we believe that unity should and can be formed in the struggle to achieve the following objectives: to achieve formal recognition of the existence of the Algerian national question, and to strive for the right of our people to manage their own national affairs.

If the French government recognizes this reality and these aspirations, it should negotiate with the qualified representatives of the Algerian people.

This negotiation should be conducted either with representatives of various nationalist parties and movements, democratic organizations, trade organizations, and cultural organizations, etc.; or, after the dissolution of the Algerian parliament, which is not representative of our country, with a delegation that truly represents the Algerian people, produced by free and democratic elections according to proportional representation (the number of representatives of each group is allocated according to the number of members of the organization).

In order for negotiations to be credible and effective, all forms of repression must first be stopped: end military operations, abolish the "state of emergency law," release political prisoners and political detainees, abolish measures prohibiting or hindering the activities of political parties, and so on.

The Algerian Communist Party reminds everyone that the realization of these minimum goals can only be the result of mass action in various forms.

Therefore, the struggle to achieve all these political demands should be developed, while at the same time developing the struggle to achieve the economic, social, and cultural demands of the working masses in urban and rural areas. Only in this way can the unity of the anti-colonial struggle be formed and consolidated.

Algeria is Not Isolated

Our people are not isolated in their struggle. It increasingly feels the support of our direct allies, the French people and workers, and the active sympathy of the anti-imperialist democratic camp led by the Soviet Union and People's China. On our own coast, the Tunisian and Moroccan people are waging the same struggle as us. Just recently, twenty-nine Asian and African countries, representing more than 1.4 billion people, also affirmed their support for national independence and peace in Bandung. The Geneva Four-Power Conference has created more favorable conditions for our struggle.

Have faith in Algeria's future! Peasants, urban and rural workers, intellectuals, merchants, prepare in action to build a broad patriotic front, which will shatter the colonial yoke once and for all and ensure our country a free, peaceful, and happy future! From today onwards, strengthen the broadest united action necessary for victory on the land of the motherland!

### 争取实现摆脱殖民主义的、友好、统一的阿尔及利亚——阿尔及利亚共产党的声明

    争取实现摆脱殖民主义的、友好、统一的阿尔及利亚
    ——阿尔及利亚共产党的声明
    新华社七日讯“新法兰西”周刊八月二十七日刊载了阿尔及利亚共产党的声明，声明题目是：“争取实现摆脱殖民主义的、友好、统一的阿尔及利亚”。声明全文如下：
    我国一百多年来不断抵抗殖民统治，今日正处在历史上决定的阶段。民族的人民的运动从来没有像现在这样声势浩大。
    各种不同形式的群众行动，清楚说明我国人民要求摆脱压迫和过真正生活的意志。
    阿尔及利亚绝大多数人民再也不愿意在自己的国家境内被当作奴隶。他们已经受够了殖民统治和它所带来的一切屈辱和不幸。他们再也不愿意被排斥在管理自己的事务之外，他们再也不愿意做农民而没有土地，做工人而摆不脱失业痛苦，做薪金收入者而备受饥饿困苦。
    但是，穷凶极恶地剥削人民的殖民者面对着阿尔及利亚人的斗争而惊慌失措，因此拒绝任何民主的解决，并且加紧了镇压。然而，什么也没有能够而且永远也不能够窒息我们的合法民族愿望。无论是扬言要在我国进行真正的战争的十二万军队也好，紧急状态也好，扫荡和不问情由一概处死也好。
    真正的解决
    在队伍中友好地团结着回教劳动者和欧洲籍劳动者的唯一政党——阿尔及利亚共产党，有它自己的纲领。共产党人，和一切爱国志士的理想就是真正的民族解放和社会解放，这就是说，建立一个不再有人剥削人现象的社会主义的阿尔及利亚。
    今天，束缚着我国人民任何发展的是殖民制度。废除殖民制度和争取民族解放是一切人的首要责任。
    阿尔及利亚绝大多数人民的正当民族愿望，同欧洲或者以色列的劳动者和民主分子的利益和前途是不冲突的，后者同掠夺阿尔及利亚财富的人——博齐奥之流、布拉谢特之流、雷纳·迈耶之流，还要加上本加纳之流和萨雅之流——是毫无共同之处的。我们的国家在若干世纪发展中实际上已经成为全体居民的共同祖国。因此，解决办法不能是阿尔及利亚人民所拒绝的同化，不能是换一种说法出现的“合并”，而是尊重我国的民族个性，建立一个民主共和国，在平等而相互尊重现存利益的基础上同法国保持自由同意的联合的关系。
    共产党人还希望实现农民的梦想：耕者有其田。共产党人正在争取实现土地改革，把大殖民者的土地和殖民主义代理人封建地主的土地分配给没有土地或土地不足的各种族的农民。
      初步成就
    人民斗争的发展已经使世界舆论注意到阿尔及利亚问题。它已经迫使某些法国人士——特别是社会党人，不得不承认我国不但存在着社会经济问题，而且存在着政治问题。我们今天有可能获得其他成就并且给予殖民主义以决定性打击，只要：
    一、广大群众的斗争继续发展。
    二、制止住“新殖民主义”的阴谋。
    事实上，法国统治者和支持他们的人一方面加紧镇压，另一方面又加紧努力，试图挫折群众的勇气，欺骗他们，分化民族民主运动。苏斯戴尔的努力和他的“改革计划”的用意正是这样。在这方面，阿尔及利亚共产党要着重指出某些民族主义领袖试图背着人民群众进行幕后谈判的危险，其结果只能是放弃人民利益。
    三、反殖民斗争的力量团结一致。
    今天我们要比以往更有力地重申：民族解放不是任何一党一派独自的事业，而是团结一致行动起来的全体人民的事业。至于我们，我们多年来就不断主张团结各个种族的阿尔及利亚人——共产主义者、民族主义者、有组织的或者无党派的民主主义者——组成民主民族战线，一致行动，争取从殖民统治下解放阿尔及利亚。
    为此，共产党申明它同一切了解必须团结阿尔及利亚人组成一个广泛的反殖民斗争战线的人们团结一致。它为目前提出一个最低纲领，以求就在今天团结一切在各种不同程度上反对殖民制度的人们，从而加强民族运动的一致性。它宣布愿意会见（我国）其他民族主义组织的代表，来共同商议这个最低纲领，并且研究实现这个纲领的办法。
    当前共同行动的基础
    在现阶段，我们认为团结应当而且可以在争取下一目的的斗争中形成，就是，争取使阿尔及利亚民族问题的存在获得正式承认，争取使我国人民有权自己管理国家事务。
    法国政府如果承认这个现实和这些愿望，就应当同阿尔及利亚人民的有资格的代表进行谈判。
    这个谈判或者同各个民族主义党派和运动、民主组织、行业组织和文化组织等等的代表进行；或者在不足以代表我国的阿尔及利亚议会解散以后，同经过自由、民主选举按照比例代表制（每一集团代表人数按组织成员人数多少分配）产生的一个真正代表阿尔及利亚人的代表团进行。
    为求谈判信实而有效，必须首先停止一切形式的镇压：结束军事行动、废除“紧急状态法”、释放政治犯和政治拘留者、取消禁止或妨碍政党活动的措施等等。
    阿尔及利亚共产党提醒大家：实现这些最低目标只能是以各种方式进行的群众行动的结果。
    因此，应当发展争取实现这一切政治要求的斗争，同时发展争取实现城乡劳动群众的经济、社会和文化要求的斗争。只有这样，反殖民斗争的团结才能形成和巩固。
    阿尔及利亚不是孤立无援的
    我国人民在斗争中不是孤立无援的。它日益感到我们的直接盟友法国人民和劳动者的声援以及以苏联和人民中国为首的反帝国主义民主阵营的积极同情。在我们这个海岸，突尼斯人民和摩洛哥人民进行同我们一样的斗争。就在最近，代表着十四亿以上人民的二十九个亚洲和非洲的国家还在万隆申明过支持民族独立和和平的事业。日内瓦四大国会议为我们的斗争创设了更加有利的条件。
    坚信阿尔及利亚的前途吧！农民们、城乡工人们、知识分子们、商人们，在行动中准备建立广泛的爱国战线吧，它将一次而永远地粉碎殖民枷锁，保证我国有自由、和平和幸福的前途！从今天起就在祖国的土地上加强一切为胜利所必需的最广泛的统一行动吧！
