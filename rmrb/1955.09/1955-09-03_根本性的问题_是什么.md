What is the "Fundamental Problem"?
Kong Sang

The three decisions to waste timber exposed by Comrade Wang Zhonglan and the "Explanation from the Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry" reflect many problems: First, the phenomenon of timber waste is indeed very serious; second, the price of boards set by the department in charge of timber prices is indeed unreasonable; third, the processing capacity and distribution of timber are indeed unbalanced. There is no doubt that these are shortcomings or errors in the work that should be reviewed or corrected.

However, are there any more important lessons besides these? Yes. According to the materials reflected in these two articles, the most direct cause of the waste lies in the serious departmentalism of the timber distribution department.

The departmentalism of the timber distribution department is first manifested in their lack of a sense of the overall situation. They clearly knew that a large number of pine bark was accumulating due to the relatively high prices stipulated by the state, but what active measures did they take to change this situation? What resolute attitude did they take to protect these pine bark, a part of the national wealth, so that they could be used rationally? None. What they considered was "to solve the problem of excess manufacturing capacity in Northeast China," and they did not hesitate to "process" poplar logs into box boards even when pine bark was piling up. In this way, the timber mills certainly had something to do, but for the country, they unnecessarily sawed up a batch of poplar trees.

Secondly, it is also manifested in their only caring about the interests of their own units and enterprises, and not caring about the interests of other units and enterprises. The special materials used by the transportation department to manufacture vehicles were previously processed by the vehicle manufacturing department. However, the forestry department also took over this part of the processing task because "the Northeast Timber Bureau had few timber production tasks, and the equipment capacity could not be fully utilized." They did not consider that this practice would leave the timber processing workshops of the vehicle manufacturing department with nothing to do, nor did they consider whether they could truly supply finished materials, and the difficulties and losses caused to the vehicle manufacturing department due to the non-conforming materials supplied. These practices are clearly contrary to the operating principles of socialist enterprises.

How does the "Explanation from the Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry" explain these problems? They believe that: "More importantly, our socialist construction has just begun, and the material requirements are complex, the distribution of processing capacity is unbalanced, and there are contradictions between production and sales. These are fundamental problems." Obviously, this statement is unsatisfactory. If we focus on these problems, we would overturn the current facts of waste exposed by Comrade Wang Zhonglan, which the Supply and Marketing Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry does not deny, and lead people to a path that does not solve the actual problem of waste.

The departmentalism of the Supply and Marketing and Timber Manufacturing units of the Ministry of Forestry is very serious, but these units are by no means the only ones with departmentalism. All economic departments and institutions should learn from the above events and resolutely oppose departmentalism. This is the "fundamental problem" of exposing and criticizing the timber waste incident.

    “根本性的问题”是什么
    孔桑
    王中岚同志揭发的三件浪费木材的决定和“林业部供销局的说明”，这两篇稿件反映了很多问题：第一，木材的浪费现象的确是很严重的；第二，掌握木材价格的部门所规定的板材价的确有不合理之处；第三，木材的加工能力和分布状况的确也不平衡。勿庸置疑，这些都是工作中的缺点或错误，应该检讨或纠正。
    但是，除此而外，还有没有更重要的教训呢？有的。根据这两篇稿件反映的材料，造成浪费的最直接的原因，还在于木材分配部门的严重的本位主义思想。
    木材分配部门的本位主义，首先表现在他们缺乏全局观念。他们明明知道由于国家的价格规定的较高，以致大批松木板皮积压，但是他们采取了什么积极措施来改变这种现状呢？采取了什么坚决的态度来保护作为国家财富的一部分的这些松木板皮得到合理的使用呢？没有。他们考虑的却是“为了解决东北制材能力过剩的问题”，不惜在松木板皮积压的情况下，又将杨木原木“加工”为箱木板皮。这样，制材厂当然有事可作了，可是对国家来说，他们却毫无必要地锯毁了一批杨木。
    其次，也表现在他们只顾本单位本企业的利益，而不顾其它单位其它企业的利益。交通运输部门制造车辆的特殊用材，过去都是由车辆制造部门加工。可是，林业部门也因为“东北制材局的成材任务少，设备能力一直不能充分发挥”，而将这一部分加工任务拉到自己身上来。他们既不考虑这种作法会使车辆制造部门的木材加工车间无事可作了，也不考虑自己能不能真正供应成材，和因为供应的材料不合规格而给车辆制造部门造成的困难和损失。这些作法，显然是同社会主义企业的经营方针背道而驰的。
    “林业部供销局的说明”是怎样解释这些问题的呢？他们认为：“更主要的是我国社会主义建设刚刚开始，而需材规格复杂，加工能力分布不平衡，生产同销售有矛盾。这些都是具有根本性的问题。”显然的，这种说法是不能令人满意的。如果从这些问题着眼，就会把王中岚同志揭发的、林业部供销局也并不否认的眼前的浪费事实一笔推翻，把人们引导到不解决现实的浪费问题的途径上去。
    林业部供销和制材单位的本位主义思想是十分严重的，但是有本位主义思想的决不只是这些单位。一切的经济部门和事业机关，都应该从以上的事件中吸取教训，坚决反对本位主义思想。这才是揭发和批评木材浪费事件的“根本性的问题”。
