    Pass on All Our Knowledge to Our Successors
    Hu Yaobang
    Our great motherland is developing so vigorously. Not only do the people need more and more means of production and means of subsistence, but even our thousands upon thousands of children are reaching out their hands, asking us for more and more knowledge.
    The fact that the youth, children, and juveniles of New China demand more and more knowledge is very clear. In the dark years of Kuomintang rule, only three to five million young people in our country could understand books and newspapers. Now, our country has 30 million young people who can read newspapers. In the dark years of Kuomintang rule, only a little over 20 million children in our country could afford to attend ordinary primary schools. Now, our country has 70 million children who need batches of complete, rich, and beautiful reading materials.
    We should strive to meet the demands of youth, children, and juveniles.
    Many of our writers cherish their honorable responsibilities very much. I know that many of our comrades are writing day and night. I also know that many old, sick, and even disabled comrades are continuing to fight. If I can speak on behalf of the children of our country, then I will not make inappropriate complaints, but express my heartfelt gratitude to them first.
    However, what I find strange is why some writers feel that writing for the children of our country is a disgraceful thing, a thing without a future. Is supplying knowledge to 70 million socialist successors, in terms of its scale, something that can be found anywhere else on earth?
    I also find it strange why some comrades say they are worried that they cannot write good things. What are good things? We can say that works that share the fate and breathe the same air with the people, with a part of our people who are the youth and children, are good works.
    In the past, our Youth League did not pay enough attention to the supply of reading materials for youth and children, and did not give writers the necessary help and support. This is not right. Our good comrades must write more and better things, our writers' ranks must develop and grow rapidly, our knowledge front must not allow Hu Feng elements and obscene and absurd things to occupy a corner, and the minds of our youth and children must be armed with the rich knowledge of the predecessors. I regret that I did not study well in the past and could not write something for the youth and children of our country. I am prepared to follow the older generation and contribute my share in this regard.
    I would also like to pay tribute to all the comrades who work faithfully in the publishing industry. Because they have supplied a large number of good quality reading materials for the children of our country, more than 13 million copies in the last year alone. They deserve to be called labor heroes of the knowledge factory. But I also find it strange that some places have published very few youth and children's books? Why are some things that are obviously counter-revolutionary elements mixed in? Why are many good books only printed in a few thousand or tens of thousands of copies? I believe that good comrades who serve in this glorious position should calculate every day how to use all their strength to publish more and better books. Because publishing more and better books is the most sacred task of comrades working in this work position.
    I also want to pay tribute to all the comrades who work faithfully in bookstores and post offices. Because they have transferred a large number of reading materials to the youth and children of our country. They are also labor heroes in spreading knowledge. But I also find it strange why the vast youth and children in many places cannot buy books, why don't we shout loudly when we see this phenomenon? I believe that young league members from managers and directors to every salesperson or deliveryman working in this glorious position should calculate every day how to deliver more and more books to the widest range of readers. They should think like this: as long as it is not forced sales, if I sold one million copies last year, and I sell two million or even ten million copies this year, then I have fulfilled my responsibility to fight for socialism most gloriously.
    Our Youth League must pay attention to the distribution of books and newspapers. In places where there are no postal stations, the grassroots organizations of the league should automatically establish voluntary postal stations to help the post office do a good job in distribution.
    Let us all work together to supply knowledge to youth and children, let us all say that for the great socialist cause, we must pass on all our knowledge to our successors.

### 把我们的全部知识传给我们的接班人

    把我们的全部知识传给我们的接班人
    胡耀邦
    我们的伟大祖国是这样蓬蓬勃勃地在发展，不仅人民需要更多更多的生产资料，更多更多的生活资料，而且连我们千千万万个孩子也伸出了手，向我们要更多更多的知识资料。
    新中国的青年、少年和儿童要求更多更多的知识资料，这情况是非常明显的。在国民党黑暗的统治年代里，我们的国家，只有三、五百万青年能够看懂书籍报刊，而现在，我们的国家已经有三千万青年能够读书看报了。在国民党黑暗的统治年代里，我们的国家，只有二千万多一点的少年儿童能够上得起普通小学，而现在，我们的国家已经有七千万个少年儿童，需要成批成套丰富美观的读物了。
    我们应努力满足青年、少年和儿童的要求。
    我们许许多多的作家是非常珍重他们自己的荣誉的职责的。我知道，我们有许多同志正夜以继日地在写作。我也知道，许多年老有病甚至残废了的同志也在继续战斗。如果我可以代表我国的少年说话的话，那末，我首先就不作不适当的埋怨，而要向他们表示衷心的感激。
    不过，使我感到奇怪的是，为什么某些作家会感到为我国的少年儿童写作是一件不光彩的事情，是一件没有出息的事情。难道供应七千万社会主义接班人知识食粮的事情，就它的规模来说，能够在地球上其他地方可以再找到的么？
    我也感到奇怪的是某些同志为什么说耽心写不出好东西来。什么是好东西？我们可以这样说，同人民，同我们人民中一部分的青年、少年共命运同呼吸的作品，就是好作品。
    我们青年团过去对供应青年、少年读物这件事情关心得不够，没有给予作家必要的帮助和支持，这是不对的。我们的好同志一定要写出更多更好的东西来，我们的作家队伍一定要迅速地发展壮大，我们的知识阵地一定不能让胡风分子和淫秽荒诞的东西占据一个角落，我国青年、少年的头脑一定要借助前人丰富的知识武装起来。我很懊悔自己过去没有很好地学习，不能给我国青年、少年写点东西。我准备在老一辈的后头跟进，在这方面献出自己的一份力量。
    我也要向出版界的一切忠实工作的同志致敬。因为他们为我国的少年儿童供应了大量的质量很好的读物，单单去年一年就是一千三百多万册。他们不愧是知识工厂的劳动英雄。但我同样觉得奇怪，为什么有些地方只出了很少的青年、少年读物？为什么中间还夹杂着一些明明是反革命分子的东西？为什么许多好书只印几千几万本？我认为在这个光荣的岗位上服务的好同志，应该天天计算怎样用一切力量出更多更好的书。因为出更多更好的书，就是在这一工作岗位上工作的同志最神圣的任务。
    我还要向书店、邮局的一切忠实工作的同志们致敬。因为他们将大量的读物转给了我国的青年、少年。他们同样是传播知识的劳动英雄。但我也同样感到奇怪，为什么许多地方的广大青年、少年买不到书，为什么我们看到这种现象不大声喊叫？我认为在这个光荣的岗位上工作的从经理、局长到每一名营业员或者投递员的青年团员，应该天天计算如何把更多更多的书送到最广大的读者手里去。应该这样想：只要不是强迫推销，去年我销了一百万册，今年我销了二百万册乃至一千万册，那就是最光荣地尽到了我为社会主义而斗争的职责。
    我们青年团一定要关心书籍报刊的发行，在没有邮站的地方，团的基层组织应该自动建立起义务邮站，帮助邮局做好发行工作。
    让我们大家同心同德地供应青年、少年的知识资料吧，让我们大家都说，为了伟大的社会主义事业，我们一定要把我们的全部知识全部传给我们的接班人。
