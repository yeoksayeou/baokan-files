Comrade Vice-Premier, dear guests, comrades and friends:

    Today, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for attending the reception celebrating the eleventh anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation from fascist and imperialist enslavement.

    September 9, 1944, was a turning point in the history of our people, because this day opened a path for our motherland towards a new social system, namely, towards socialism.

    For our people, such great happiness would not have been possible without the glorious victory of the heroic Soviet army. Therefore, September 9th is not only our day of liberation, but also a day of boundless gratitude and love from our people to their liberators, and a festival of eternal friendship and cooperation with the brotherly nations of the great country that is building socialism.

    In the eleven years since liberation, profound changes have taken place in the lives of the Bulgarian people. Fundamental socialist transformations have been implemented domestically, and significant achievements have been made in industrial and agricultural development, in the construction and consolidation of a free and independent people's democratic state. Thanks to the heroic labor of the Bulgarian working class, and thanks to the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, the People's Republic of Bulgaria has developed a thriving industry that is increasingly meeting the growing needs of the national economy.

    Under the leadership of the heroic Bulgarian Communist Party, Bulgaria is gloriously carrying out the immortal Dimitrov's behest—to build Bulgaria into a prosperous and strong country. At present, the Bulgarian people have mobilized all their forces to complete the second five-year plan ahead of schedule, to further boost the national economy and culture, to improve the material and cultural welfare of the working people, and to strive for the construction of socialism in our country.

    The victories gained by the Bulgarian people in building socialism are a valuable contribution to the common cause of the democratic camp's struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    The Bulgarian people, engaged in peaceful and creative labor, along with the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, are deeply concerned about the cause of defending and strengthening international peace and security.

    In order to be friendly with all countries, ease international tensions and strengthen world peace, the People's Republic of Bulgaria has consistently pursued a policy of peace.

    The friendly and fraternal cooperation between our country and the great People's Republic of China is constantly growing and strengthening. This is evidenced by the ever-expanding economic and cultural exchanges between our two countries. Further strengthening the fraternal friendship and cooperation with the great People's Republic of China in the common friendship with the democratic camp countries headed by the Soviet Union is a sacred duty for the Bulgarian people, because this friendship is the victorious guarantee of building our free and happy life. In the struggle of the people of the world for peace and prosperity, our people feel justly proud to be able to advance side by side with the great Chinese people and become an inseparable part of the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

    Dear guests, please allow me to raise the first glass to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people, to the further achievements of the Chinese people, the builders of socialism and the staunch fighters who defend and consolidate peace in Asia and the world, in developing the national economy and culture, to the heroic Communist Party of China, and to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    塔科夫代办的讲话尊敬的副总理同志，亲爱的来宾们，同志们和朋友们：
    今天承蒙各位光临庆祝保加利亚从法西斯和帝国主义奴役下获得解放十一周年的招待会，请允许我向你们表示衷心的感谢。
    一九四四年九月九日是我们人民历史上的转折点，因为这一天为我们祖国开辟了一条通往新社会制度的道路，即通往社会主义的道路。
    对我国人民来说，这样一个巨大的幸福，如果没有英勇的苏联军队光辉的胜利，是不可能的。因此，九月九日是我们解放的日子，同时也是我国人民对自己的解放者无限感激和热爱的日子，也是同正在建设社会主义的伟大国家各兄弟民族永远友好和合作的节日。
    解放后十一年来，在保加利亚人民生活当中发生了深刻的变化。国内实行了根本的社会主义的改造，在工业、农业和文化发展方面，在建设和巩固自由的、独立的人民民主主义国家方面，都取得了重大的成就。由于保加利亚工人阶级英勇的劳动，由于伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营各国无私的援助，保加利亚人民共和国已经有了发达的工业，这种工业越来越大地满足着国民经济不断增长的需要。
    在英勇的保加利亚共产党领导下，保加利亚光荣地执行着不朽的季米特洛夫的遗训——把保加利亚建成一个繁荣富强的国家。目前，保加利亚人民动员了各方面的力量为提前完成第二个五年计划、为国民经济和文化的进一步高涨、为提高劳动人民的物质和文化福利，为在我国建设社会主义而奋斗。
    保加利亚人民在建设社会主义中所获得的胜利，对于民主阵营为和平、民主、社会主义而斗争的共同事业是一个宝贵的贡献。
    从事和平和创造性劳动的保加利亚人民，同苏联、中国及社会主义阵营各国人民一道深切地关怀着保卫和加强国际和平与安全的事业。
    为了同各国人民友好、缓和国际紧张局势并加强世界和平，保加利亚人民共和国一贯地奉行着爱好和平的政策。
    我们国家同伟大的中华人民共和国之间的友好和兄弟般的合作不断增长并加强。这可从我们两国之间日益扩大的经济和文化交流方面得到证明。在同以苏联为首的民主阵营各国共同友谊中，进一步加强同伟大的中华人民共和国兄弟友谊及合作，对保加利亚人民来说是神圣的天职，因为这个友谊是建设我们自由幸福生活的胜利保证。在世界人民争取和平与繁荣的斗争中，我国人民能够同伟大的中国人民并肩前进，并成为以伟大苏联为首的和平民主阵营不可分割的一部分，从而感到正当的骄傲。
    敬爱的来宾们，请允许我举第一杯酒，为保中人民牢不可破的友谊，为社会主义建设者、捍卫并巩固亚洲和世界和平的坚定战士——中国人民在发展国民经济和文化事业中进一步取得成就，为英勇的中国共产党，为中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的健康干杯！
