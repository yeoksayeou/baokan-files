Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 1st - According to Indian newspapers, to commemorate the 2,500th anniversary of the birth of Sakyamuni, the Indian government plans to hold national commemorative meetings at various important Buddhist centers in May next year. The Indian government has appointed a committee chaired by Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan to commemorate the celebrations.

    The Indian government has decided to use more than 10 million rupees to provide roads and other necessary facilities in important Buddhist centers such as Sanchi in Bhopal, Nalanda and Bodh Gaya in Bihar Province, and Sarnath and Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh, to facilitate pilgrims to worship at that time.

    The Indian government is also in contact with the Nepalese government, requesting it to repair Lumbini, the birthplace of Sakyamuni in Nepal, and to provide better transportation facilities for pilgrims traveling from India.

    The Indian government has asked its Department of Publicity and Broadcasting to publish "2,500 Years of Buddhism" and "Buddhist Images," and to release documentary films about Buddhism. The Indian government will also provide financial assistance to the Nalanda Pali Research Institute to publish several volumes of Buddhist scriptures, the "Tripitaka."

    A series of commemorative stamps will also be issued at that time.

    为纪念释迦牟尼诞生二千五百周年
    印度政府筹备举行庆祝会
    新华社新德里一日电　据印度报纸报道，为纪念释迦牟尼诞生二千五百周年，印度政府计划在明年五月在各个重要的佛教中心举行全国性的纪念会。印度政府已经任命了一个以印度副总统拉德哈克里希南为主席的委员会来纪念庆祝事宜。
    印度政府决定用一千多万卢比在波保尔的桑吉，比哈尔省的那烂陀和菩提加雅，北方省的鹿野苑和拘尸那揭罗等重要佛教中心提供道路和其他的必要便利，以利于香客们在那个时候进香朝拜。
    印度政府还同尼泊尔政府接触，要求它修缮释迦牟尼在尼泊尔的诞生地蓝毗尼，并且为从印度前往的香客提供更好的运输便利。
    印度政府已经要求它的宣传和广播部出版“二千五百年的佛教”和“佛教图像”二书，并且发行关于佛教的纪录影片。印度政府还将给予那烂陀巴利文研究院财政援助，出版几卷佛经“三藏”。
    那时还要发行一系列纪念邮票。
