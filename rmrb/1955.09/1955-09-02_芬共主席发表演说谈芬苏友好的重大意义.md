Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 31st: According to TASS, the Finnish Communist Party (FCP) held celebrations in Turku for its 37th anniversary. The Chairman of the FCP, Aimo Aaltonen, delivered a speech at the meeting. When discussing international issues and Finland's relations with other countries, Aaltonen said in his speech: The Finnish Communist Party has consistently upheld the policy of friendship between Finland and the Soviet Union. It is pleased that this policy of peace and friendship is now recognized as the general guideline of our country's foreign policy. The vast majority of Finns have learned from experience that the Soviet Union is a sincere and strong friend, safeguarding our country's security and helping us overcome economic difficulties.

Aaltonen pointed out: However, there are also some chauvinists in Finland who are doing their utmost to hinder the country's peaceful development. These people are gathered around the Coalition Party.

Aaltonen continued: The more signs there are of easing international tensions, the more frantic this small but rampant group of warmongers becomes. They know that the new stage beginning in international relations means a comprehensive strengthening and expansion of mutual trust and cooperation between the Finnish and Soviet peoples.

    芬共主席发表演说谈芬苏友好的重大意义
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基三十一日讯：芬兰共产党成立三十七周年庆祝会在土库举行。芬兰共产党主席艾摩·阿尔托宁在会上发表了演说。阿尔托宁在演说中谈到国际问题以及芬兰同其他国家的关系的时候说：芬兰共产党始终维护着芬兰同苏联友好的政策。它感到高兴的是：这个和平和友好的方针现在被承认是我国外交政策的总方针。芬兰绝大多数人从经验中认识了苏联是一个真诚而强大的朋友，苏联在保障着我国的安全，并且帮助我们克服经济上的困难。
    阿尔托宁指出：然而，在芬兰也有一些沙文主义分子，他们竭力阻挠国家的和平发展。这些人集合在联合党的周围。
    阿尔托宁接着说：缓和国际紧张局势的迹象越多，这个小小的但是猖狂的战争贩子集团就越疯狂。他们知道，在国际关系中开始的新阶段就是意味着芬苏两国人民互相信任和合作的全面加强和扩大。
