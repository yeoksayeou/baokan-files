    The Geneva Accords Must Be Strictly Observed
    Wang Tieya, Director of the Chinese Political Science and Law Association

    The recent activities of the South Vietnamese authorities, with the support of the United States government, have seriously violated the spirit and terms of the Geneva Accords. While a ceasefire in Vietnam has been achieved and the regrouping and transfer of forces have been completed, the South Vietnamese authorities have not only illegally reinforced weapons and war materials, illegally recruited large numbers of foreign military personnel, and continued to prepare for war, but also, in order to carry out war preparations, intensified the suppression and slaughter of the South Vietnamese people, and carried out cruel reprisals against former resistance personnel; these activities violate the provisions of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam. At the same time, the South Vietnamese authorities have disregarded the statements and notes of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 6 and July 19 regarding the holding of consultative conferences, and refused to implement the provisions of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference regarding the convening of consultative conferences to hold free general elections, attempting to overturn the solemn international agreements reached at the Geneva Conference. This situation has aroused the deep concern of people all over the world.

    No one can deny that there is a principle in international law that "agreements must be kept." The early international law scholar Vattel was right when he said, "He who violates his treaties violates at the same time the law of nations," "If treaties are not considered as inviolable and sacred promises, nations will be nothing but words," and therefore those who violate treaties are "enemies of the human race who destroy the foundations of the public peace and security of nations." Even American international law scholars, in their drafted "Draft International Convention on the Law of Treaties," cannot but admit that "every state is bound to carry out in good faith the obligations arising from treaties to which it is a party.” The Convention passed by the Sixth International Conference of American States in 1928 also stipulated that "no State can relieve itself of the obligations of a treaty or modify its stipulations, unless by the consent of the other contracting parties secured through pacific means." The United Nations Charter expressly stipulates in its preamble "respect for obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law." This proves that "agreements must be kept" is a universally recognized and unshakable basic principle of international law, and a prerequisite for normal international relations. The South Vietnamese authorities, under the direction and support of the United States government, are violating the Geneva Accords, precisely violating this principle, precisely undermining the foundation of international law.

    The South Vietnamese authorities' violation of the Geneva Accords is already an undeniable fact. Reinforcement of weapons and war materials violates Articles 4 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Articles 16 and 17 of the Armistice Agreement; the slaughter of the people and reprisals against former resistance personnel violate Articles 8 and 9 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement; the refusal to convene consultative conferences for free general elections violates Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. However, in order to sabotage the Geneva Accords, the South Vietnamese authorities actually made excuses and brazenly claimed that they did not sign the Geneva Accords, and therefore they are not bound by the Geneva Accords, and refuse to fulfill the obligations stipulated by the Geneva Accords. This excuse is unfounded and extremely absurd. This excuse is a contempt for all rules in international law regarding the validity of treaties, a denial of the basic principle of international law that "agreements must be kept," and an attempt to undermine the entire foundation of international law.

    As a complete international agreement, the Geneva Accords include various provisions on military armistice and political settlement, which are indivisible. The representatives of the relevant parties who signed the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam at the Geneva Conference were the representative of the Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army on the one hand, and the representative of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces in Indochina on the other. It is clear that when the representative of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces signed the agreement on restoring peace in Vietnam, he represented not only the French government in general, but also specifically represented one party to the ceasefire. Regardless of the position of the South Vietnamese authorities in the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces, whether it belongs to a part of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces, or whether it inherited the powers of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces in South Vietnam, it cannot but be bound by the Geneva Accords. This is a recognized rule of international law; if a part of one party to an international agreement or the successor of a position of one party can arbitrarily deny the binding force of an agreement, then many agreements in the international community will completely lose their meaning. In order to prevent any distortion, Article 27 of the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam" specifically stipulates: "The signatories of this document and their successors in office shall be responsible for complying with and implementing the various terms and provisions of this Agreement." According to this provision, France and its successors in Vietnam have a clear obligation to fulfill the agreement. The "successor" stipulated here is currently the South Vietnamese authorities, so the South Vietnamese authorities have a full obligation to be responsible for complying with and implementing all the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The excuse made by the Ngo Dinh Diem government that it was not bound because it did not sign the agreement has no legal basis whatsoever.

    In fact, in the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning the ceasefire, the demarcation of the provisional military demarcation line, and the withdrawal and regrouping of military forces, the Ngo Dinh Diem government and its army have always been bound by the Geneva Accords as part of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union Forces. In the provisions on political and administrative measures, Article 14(a) of the Armistice Agreement stipulates: "Pending the general elections which will bring about the unification of Viet-Nam, the civil administration in each regrouping zone shall be in the hands of the party whose forces are to regroup there in accordance with the terms of the present Agreement." It was based on this provision that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities took over the civil administration of the entire regrouping zone of the French Union Forces south of the provisional military demarcation line in Vietnam. Since it assumed responsibility and enjoyed rights in accordance with this provision of the Geneva Accords, it also correspondingly assumed the responsibility and obligation to fully implement other provisions related to this provision—including: Article 14(c) and (d) of the Armistice Agreement, and Articles 8 and 9 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, regarding not carrying out reprisals or discrimination against any person or group in the regrouping zone, and guaranteeing their democratic freedoms, and the safety of their lives and property; the obligation in Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference regarding holding consultations and achieving free general elections. There is no reason to evade these obligations.

    In short, the entire Geneva Accords—including the Final Declaration and the Armistice Agreement, are legally binding on the South Vietnamese authorities; this cannot be changed by any excuse of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. What Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference in New Delhi on July 19 was very correct. He said, "The South Vietnamese government must assume the responsibilities and obligations that every succeeding government should assume. When the Geneva Accords were signed, France represented South Vietnam. It would be an intolerable situation if every succeeding government denied the agreements reached by its predecessor." The excuse made by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique that it is not bound by the agreement is essentially an attempt to undermine the entire Geneva Accords, to despise all rules in international law regarding the validity of treaties, and to undermine the basic principle of international law that "agreements must be kept."

    It should be pointed out that the United States government bears a major responsibility for the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's fabrication of excuses to undermine the entire Geneva Accords. When the Ngo Dinh Diem clique openly expressed its refusal to conduct consultations and unreasonably violated the main provisions of the Geneva Accords, US Secretary of State Dulles immediately declared: "The United States supports the position held by Ngo Dinh Diem of free Vietnam." This fact clearly shows that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's activities to sabotage the agreement were directed and supported by the United States government. The United States, as one of the five major powers, participated in the Geneva Conference, and an agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina was reached at the Geneva Conference in which the United States itself participated. Although the US representative issued a statement at the conference stating that it was "not prepared to join" the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, people have seen that the US government has recognized the agreements and provisions reached at the conference, and has formally stated that it will not interfere with these agreements and provisions, and "will view any renewal of aggression in violation of the aforesaid agreements with grave concern.” According to recognized rules of international law, such a "unilateral declaration" already constitutes an agreement between the United States and other countries participating in the Geneva Accords. The United States is by no means a country that has nothing to do with the Geneva Accords; on the contrary, it affirmatively has the obligation to respect the provisions of the Geneva Accords through this statement. The US government now disregards its obligations, not only does not respect the Geneva Accords, but also directs and supports the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's activities to undermine the Geneva Accords. In this way, the US government cannot escape its responsibility for directly undermining solemn international agreements.

    It should also be pointed out that France has the responsibility to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords. The representative of the French government personally signed the Armistice Agreement, and the French delegation at the Geneva Conference also expressed full agreement with the Final Declaration. In fact, whether in the Armistice Agreement or in the Final Declaration, France is a directly related party, and it bears the clear obligations stipulated by these agreements. It is the due responsibility of the French government to thoroughly implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords with practical actions. If the French government only passively declares its respect for the Geneva Accords, it is completely inconsistent with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    The Geneva Accords are a solemn international agreement. In accordance with the basic principles of international law, and in accordance with all recognized rules in international law regarding the validity of treaties, all countries participating in the Geneva Conference must strictly abide by the provisions of this international agreement. Any excuse is legally unfounded; using excuses to attempt to evade the obligations stipulated by the agreement is a deliberate attempt to undermine the international agreement. The Geneva Accords not only ended the Indochina War, bringing peace to Indochina, but also have great historical significance for consolidating peace and security in Asia and the world. In order to safeguard the basic principles of international law, and in order to safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world, all activities that undermine the Geneva Accords must be stopped, and all provisions of the Geneva Accords must be strictly observed.

    日内瓦协议必须严格遵守
    中国政治法律学会理事　王铁崖
    在美国政府的支持下，越南南部当局最近进行的种种活动，严重地违反了日内瓦协议的精神和条款。越南停火已经实现，军队的集结和转移已经完成，但是，越南南部当局不仅非法增援武器和战争物资，非法招来大批外国军事人员，继续准备战争，而且为了执行战争的准备，加紧镇压和屠杀南越人民，对以前抗战人员进行残酷报复；这些活动都违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言和关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定的规定。与此同时，越南南部当局竟然不顾越南民主共和国政府六月六日和七月十九日关于举行协商会议的声明和照会，拒绝执行日内瓦会议最后宣言关于召开协商会议举行自由普选的规定，企图推翻日内瓦会议所达成的庄严的国际协议。这一情况已经引起全世界人民的深切注意。
    谁都不能否认，国际法有这样一个原则，就是：“约定必须遵守”。早先国际法学者法泰尔说得对：“破坏条约者同时就是破坏国际法”，“如果国家不把条约看作庄严的诺言，条约就将只是空话”，因而破坏条约者是“摧毁各国公共和平与安全的基础的公敌”。就是美国国际法学者，在他们编订的“条约法国际公约草案”中，也不能不承认：“国家应该诚实执行条约中所担负的义务”。一九二八年第六次美洲国家会议所通过的公约还规定：“任何国家，除了经过和平方法取得其他缔约国的协议外，不得解除自己的条约义务或修改条约条款。”联合国宪章在序文里明文规定，“尊重由条约与国际法及其他渊源而起之义务”。这就证明，“约定必须遵守”是举世公认的不可动摇的国际法基本原则，是国际正常关系的先决条件。越南南部当局在美国政府的指使和支持下破坏日内瓦协议，正是破坏这一原则，正是破坏国际法的基础。
    越南南部当局违反日内瓦协议已经是无可否认的事实。增援武器与战争物资违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第四条和停战协定第十六、第十七各条的规定；屠杀人民和对以前抗战人员进行报复违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第八条、第九条和停战协定第十四条的规定；拒绝召开协商会议进行自由普选违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条的规定。但是，越南南部当局为了破坏日内瓦协议，居然制造借口，放肆地声称，它没有在日内瓦协议上签字，因而它不受日内瓦协议的约束，就拒绝履行日内瓦协议所规定的义务。这种借口是毫无根据的，是极端荒谬的。这种借口是蔑视国际法上关于条约效力的一切规则，是否定“约定必须遵守”的国际法基本原则，也就是企图破坏整个国际法的基础。
    作为一个完整的国际协定，日内瓦协议包括了关于军事停战和政治解决的各项条款，这些条款是不可分割的。代表有关方面在日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定上签字的，是以越南人民军总司令代表为一方，驻印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令代表为另一方。很显然，驻印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令代表签字在以恢复越南和平为内容的协定时，他就不仅是一般地代表了法国政府，而且特别代表了停战双方的一方。不论越南南部当局在法兰西联邦部队总司令一方中处于何种地位，不论它是属于法兰西联邦部队总司令一方中的一部分，抑是继承了法兰西联邦部队总司令部在越南南部的职权，都是不能不受日内瓦协议的约束的。这是国际法公认的规则；如果一个国际协定的一方的某一部分或一方的职务的继承者可以任意否定一个协定的约束力，那末，国际上许多协定就将完全失去意义。为了防止任何歪曲起见，“关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定”第二十七条还特别明文规定：“本文件签署人及其职务的继承人均应负责遵守并实施本协定的各项条款和规定。”按照这条规定，法国及其在越南的继承人都负有履行协定的明确义务。这里所规定的“继承人”，在目前就是越南南部当局，因此越南南部当局完全有义务负责遵守并实施日内瓦协议的全部规定。吴庭艳政府所制造出来的没有在协定上签字因而不受约束的借口，在法律上是丝毫没有根据的。
    事实上，在执行日内瓦协议中有关停火、划分临时军事分界线、撤退和集结军事部队等条款中，吴庭艳政府和它的军队一直是作为法兰西联邦部队总司令一方的一部分而受到了日内瓦协议的约束的。在关于政治和行政措施的条款中，停战协定第十四条甲款规定：“在举行获致越南统一的全国选举以前，各集结区的民政由依照本协定应在该区集结部队的一方负责。”就是根据这一条款的规定，吴庭艳当局接管了越南临时军事分界线以南的整个法兰西联邦部队集结区的民政。它既然依据日内瓦协议这一条款担负了责任，享有了权利，因而也就相应地担负了完全履行同这一条款相关联的其他条款的责任和义务——其中包括：停战协定第十四条丙款、丁款和日内瓦会议最后宣言第八条、第九条中关于不得对集结区内任何人和团体施行报复歧视，并保障其民主自由和生命财产的义务；日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条关于举行协商、实现自由普选的义务。这些义务是没有任何理由可以规避的。
    总而言之，整个日内瓦协议——包括最后宣言和停战协定，对于越南南部当局是具有法律的拘束力的；这是吴庭艳集团的任何借口所不能变更的。印度总理尼赫鲁七月十九日在新德里记者招待会上所说的是十分正确的，他说：“南越政府必须负起每一个接替的政府所应该负起的责任和义务。在日内瓦协议签订的时候，法国代表南越。如果每一个接替的政府都否认它的前任政府所达成的协定，这将是一个不可能容忍的局面。”吴庭艳集团制造的不受协定约束的借口，实质上就是企图破坏整个日内瓦协议，蔑视国际法上一切关于条约效力的规则，破坏“约定必须遵守”的国际法基本原则。
    应该指出，对于吴庭艳集团制造借口企图破坏整个日内瓦协议，美国政府负有重大的责任。当吴庭艳集团公开表示拒绝进行协商并无理违反日内瓦协议的主要规定的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯竟然立即声明：“美国支持自由越南吴庭艳所持的立场。”这一事实就显然表明吴庭艳集团破坏协议的活动是受到美国政府的指使和支持的。美国作为五大国之一参加了日内瓦会议，就在美国自己所参加的日内瓦会议上达成关于恢复印度支那和平问题的协议。尽管美国代表在会议上发表声明，表明“不准备参与”日内瓦会议最后宣言，但是，人们都看到，美国政府曾经在会议上承认了会议所达成的协定和条款，而且正式声明不去妨害这些协定和条款，并且“将充分关切地注视违反上述协定的任何侵略的再起”。这样的“单方面的声明”，依据公认的国际法规则，已经构成美国与参加日内瓦协议其他国家之间的协议。美国绝不是与日内瓦协议毫无关系的国家，相反地，它通过这一声明是肯定地负有尊重日内瓦协议的规定的义务的。美国政府现在竟然不顾自己所担负的义务，不仅不尊重日内瓦协议，而且指使和支持吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的活动，这样，美国政府是无法逃避它直接破坏庄严的国际协议的责任的。
    还应该指出，对于日内瓦协议，法国负有彻底实现的责任。法国政府的代表亲自签字于停战协定，法国代表团在日内瓦会议上对于最后宣言也曾经表示完全同意。事实上，无论在停战协定上抑在最后宣言上，法国是直接有关的一方，它担负这些协议所规定的明确义务。以实际行动来彻底实现日内瓦协议的规定是法国政府应有的责任。如果法国政府仍然只是消极地宣布尊重日内瓦协议，那是与日内瓦协议的规定完全不相符合的。
    日内瓦协议是一个庄严的国际协议。依据国际法的基本原则，依据国际法上一切关于条约效力的公认规则，所有参加日内瓦会议的国家都必须严格遵守这一国际协议的规定。任何借口，在法律上都是毫无根据的；利用借口企图规避协议规定的义务都是存心破坏国际协议。日内瓦协议不仅结束印度支那战争，给印度支那带来和平，而且对于巩固亚洲和世界和平与安全具有重大的历史意义。为了维护国际法的基本原则，为了维护亚洲及世界的和平安全，破坏日内瓦协议的一切活动必须停止，日内瓦协议的一切规定必须严格遵守。
