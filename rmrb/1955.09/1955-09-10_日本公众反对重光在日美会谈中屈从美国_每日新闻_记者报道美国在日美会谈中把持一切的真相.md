Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu葵's policy of capitulating to the United States and undertaking military obligations in the Japan-U.S. talks has aroused widespread opposition and dissatisfaction among the Japanese people.

    On the 7th, Asahi Broadcasting Corporation conducted a street recording in Tokyo and Osaka, entitled "What the Japan-U.S. Talks Have Brought." Almost everyone recorded on the street expressed dissatisfaction with the results of the Japan-U.S. talks. For example, in Osaka, out of six hundred people, with the exception of two or three, all condemned the Japan-U.S. talks and expressed strong opposition to Shigemitsu's promise to the United States to send troops abroad. They said: "Resolutely oppose sending troops overseas"; "I myself have suffered from the scourge of war, and I firmly oppose sending my sons overseas to fight again." Some people also said that when the Soviet-Japanese negotiations were being held in London, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu made such an anti-communist statement in Washington, which made people feel indignant.

    The left and right wings of the Socialist Party issued a joint statement again on the 8th, believing that Shigemitsu's trip to Washington was a failure. The two parties stated that they would demand that Shigemitsu explain the failure of his mission in the Diet and would investigate the Hatoyama government's foreign policy. The statement pointed out that Shigemitsu had apparently provided the United States with a guarantee that Japan would send troops abroad.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 8th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" published a report by its reporter Omori on the 6th, which explained the truth about the United States controlling everything in the Japan-U.S. talks. Omori said that the Japanese negotiating representatives, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu葵, Democratic Party Secretary-General Kishi Nobusuke, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kono Ichiro, showed a "pathetic scene" in the negotiations and "completely fell into the control of the United States."

    Taking the issue of Japan sending troops abroad as an example, Omori said that a U.S. State Department official issued a statement after the talks, saying that in a new "security treaty," Japan would undertake the obligation to send troops abroad. This statement shocked the Japanese negotiating representatives "like a bomb." Omori said that the three Japanese representatives had requested that the passage on sending Japanese troops abroad be deleted from the record during the talks, but U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Admiral Radford emphasized that this was one of the primary conditions for the United States and Japan to sign a new "security treaty." Omori wrote: Kishi Nobusuke and Kono were greatly shocked, and Shigemitsu's face turned pale. However, when they walked out of the State Department, they all tried to calm themselves and pretended to be nonchalant in their conversations. Shigemitsu even emphasized, "I did not promise to send Japanese troops abroad to perform tasks."

    Omori recalled that when discussing the issue of common security, Dulles frankly raised the issue of Japan's obligation to send troops to foreign countries to Shigemitsu. The Japanese negotiating representatives then became confused. Kono waved to Shigemitsu and warned Shigemitsu in Japanese "it's better to ignore it," and requested that Kishi Nobusuke conduct the talks with Dulles. Kishi Nobusuke then turned the conversation to economic issues. However, Dulles did not relax the issue he raised. Omori said: When Dulles saw the Japanese line collapsing, "he treated these Japanese as children and reasoned with them, and demanded a quick compromise." Later, the Americans also severely criticized the Japanese for this "unimaginable act of violating diplomatic conventions."

    Omori also said that Shigemitsu had held eight talks with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Allison before departing for Washington, and it was "unimaginable" that he claimed he did not know that the Americans would raise the issue of sending troops abroad.

    In addition, according to a report by Kyodo News Agency's New York correspondent on the 5th, a "senior Japanese official" who participated in the Japan-U.S. talks also confirmed that the conversation on sending Japanese troops abroad had been recorded in the discussion records between Shigemitsu葵 and Dulles. He also said that Dulles raised this issue when Shigemitsu suggested revising the U.S.-Japan "security treaty" at the second day's meeting of the Japan-U.S. talks.

    According to Japanese reporters, this "senior official" is Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kono Ichiro. He also revealed that Dulles said in response to the Japanese representatives' request to relax the "embargo" on China, "It is not appropriate to relax this restriction or consider this issue at present." Dulles also refused Japan's request to return Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands as soon as possible, saying, "Due to military reasons, now is not the appropriate time to change the status of these islands."

    日本公众反对重光在日美会谈中屈从美国
    “每日新闻”记者报道美国在日美会谈中把持一切的真相
    新华社九日讯　东京消息：日本外务相重光葵在日美会谈中屈从美国承担军事义务的政策，引起了日本群众的普遍反对和不满。
    朝日广播公司七日在东京和大阪两地分别举行了一次街头录音，题目是“日美会谈带来的东西”。在大街上被录音的人几乎全都对日美会谈的结果表示不满。例如，在大阪，六百个人当中除去两三个人以外，都谴责这次日美会谈，对重光向美国保证向国外派兵的承诺更是表示强烈反对。他们说：“坚决反对派兵到海外去”；“我自己就是遭受战争灾祸的人，我坚决反对再把自己的儿子派到海外去打仗”。有的人还说：苏日谈判正在伦敦举行的时候，外相重光却在华盛顿发表那样的反共声明，使人感到愤慨。
    左、右两派社会党在八日再次发表联合声明，认为重光的华盛顿之行是失败的。两党表示要在国会中要求重光解释他的使命的失败，并且要对鸠山政府的外交政策进行追究。声明指出，重光显然向美国提供了日本将派兵出国的保证。
    新华社八日讯　东京消息：日本“每日新闻”六日刊载了它的记者大森的一篇报道，它说明了美国在日美会谈中把持一切的真相。大森说，日本谈判代表外务相重光葵、民主党干事长岸信介、农林相河野一郎在谈判中表现出一种“可悲的景象”，“完全落入了美国的摆布”。
    大森以有关日本派兵出国问题为例说，一位美国国务院官员在会谈结束后发表声明说，在一个新的“安全条约”中，日本将承担派遣军队到国外去的义务。这个声明像一枚炸弹似的使日本谈判代表们“大吃一惊”。大森说，日本的三位代表在会谈中曾要求把派遣日军出国的那段话从记录中删掉，但是美国国务卿杜勒斯和海军上将雷德福都强调说，这是美日两国签订新的“安全条约”的首要条件之一。大森写道：岸信介和河野都大为震惊，重光脸色惨白。但是，他们在走出国务院时都还强自镇静，在谈话中装出若无其事的样子。重光甚至强调说明，“我没有承诺派日本军队到国外去执行任务。”
    大森回述说，当讨论共同安全问题的时候，杜勒斯就直率地向重光提出日本有派军队到外国去的义务。日本谈判代表们这时产生了混乱现象。河野向重光挥挥手，用日本话警告重光“还是不管它好”，并且要求由岸信介来和杜勒斯进行谈话。岸信介接着把谈话转向了经济问题。但是，杜勒斯并没有放松他提出来的问题。大森说：当杜勒斯看到日本人的阵线瓦解的时候，“他就把这些日本人当成小孩子来同他们讲道理，并且要求迅速妥协。”后来，美国人还因为这件“不可想像的破坏外交惯例的行动”严厉地批评了日本人。
    大森还说：重光在启程赴华盛顿以前，曾同美国驻日大使艾利逊会谈过八次，而他竟然说不知道美国人会提出派兵出国问题，这是“不可想像的”。
    另外据共同社驻纽约记者五日报道，曾经参加日美会谈的一位“日本高级官员”也证实，关于派遣日本军队出国问题的谈话，已经记在重光葵和杜勒斯之间的讨论纪录里。他还说：这个问题是在日美会谈第二天会议上重光建议修改美日“安全条约”时，杜勒斯提出来的。
    据日本记者们说，这位“高级官员”就是农林相河野一郎。他还透露，杜勒斯在回答日本代表关于放宽对中国的“禁运”的要求时说，“在目前放宽这种限制或考虑这个问题，是不合适的。”对于日本要求早日归还冲绳岛和小笠原群岛的问题，杜勒斯也同样予以拒绝说，“由于军事原因，现在还不是改变这些岛屿地位的适当时机。”
