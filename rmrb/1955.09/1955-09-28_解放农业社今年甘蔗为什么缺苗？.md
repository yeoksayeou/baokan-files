    Why Did the Liberation Agricultural Cooperative Have Missing Sugarcane Seedlings This Year?

    Editor:

    In Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, the Liberation Agricultural Production Cooperative's various crops are growing better this year than last year, except for the sugarcane fields, which are far worse. Is it because this year's natural conditions are not suitable for sugarcane growth? No, it's a man-made disaster!

    The reason for this is as follows: When the sugarcane was about to be harvested last year, the Liberation Agricultural Production Cooperative received a notice from the supply and marketing cooperative: "In order to improve the quality of cane sugar, it has been decided that sugarcane should be cut one month later than in previous years (harvesting in previous years was in late October)." However, before late November arrived, a cold wave struck. Experienced cooperative members suggested that as soon as the temperature dropped, the sugarcane should be cut down and stored in cellars to prevent freezing, so as not to affect the sugar content and next year's planting. After research, the cooperative management committee believed this opinion was correct, but because of the contractual relationship with the supply and marketing cooperative, they immediately sought the opinion of the supply and marketing cooperative. After asking for instructions, the supply and marketing cooperative replied: "Harvest at the previously scheduled time." After several more negotiations, the supply and marketing cooperative finally refused to accept this correct request. At this time, some individual farmers began to cut and harvest on their own, but the agricultural cooperative dared not take action because it was obeying the contract. It was not until the cold wave struck continuously that they hurriedly cut and harvested, but it was too late. Most of the sugarcane was frozen. As a result, the quality of the sugar content was reduced, affecting the sugar factory's sugar production. Of the sugarcane seeds retained by the cooperative, more than half of the local sugarcane (native variety) could still germinate, but most of the buds of the improved varieties were frozen and could not be used for seed. This year's sugarcane seeds were purchased and transported from Neijiang by the supply and marketing cooperative. However, the decision to delay sugarcane cutting was uniformly arranged in the Neijiang area, so the purchased sugarcane seeds were also damaged by frost. The germination rate after planting was only 47%, and there were serious gaps in the rows. Although the cooperative planted corn in time to fill the gaps (it was too late to replant sugarcane), sugarcane production has suffered a great loss. The sugarcane seedlings are growing unevenly, and there is more corn than sugarcane in the severely affected plots, making it look like sugarcane is interplanted in a cornfield. The cooperative management committee recently made a trial calculation, estimating that the yield of improved sugarcane will only be more than 3,800 jin per mu this year, a decrease of 61.8% compared to last year. The yield of local sugarcane will only be more than 6,400 jin per mu, a decrease of 23% compared to last year, which is even more than the planned reduction for this year. In total, the cooperative expects to reduce sugarcane production by about 600,000 jin, a loss of more than 7,000 yuan, plus the cost of purchasing and transporting seeds from outside, totaling about 9,000 yuan, with each cooperative member's household averaging a reduction in income of about 27 yuan. More seriously, many sugarcane-growing areas in Neijiang have suffered similar losses.

    Any decision and implementation of agricultural technical measures must be based on local natural conditions and the experience of the masses. Especially when natural conditions change, even more, should already unsuitable measures be changed in time. This is a principle that need not be explained further. The local supply and marketing cooperative's decision was correct under normal circumstances, and cutting later could improve the quality of cane sugar. However, when natural conditions changed and a cold wave forecast was issued, the relevant departments of the supply and marketing cooperative did not proactively change the original decision based on the general experience that sugarcane is susceptible to frost. On the contrary, they subjectively and mechanically insisted on implementing this decision. What is even more serious is that when the cold wave had already struck and the masses of cooperative members were demanding to harvest quickly, they still ignored the opinions of the masses, resulting in such a serious loss. This kind of mistake is not only a bureaucratic problem, but also a degree of subjective idealism approaching "despotism." This attitude towards the production of the masses is in no way similar to the positive leadership of our Party and state towards agricultural production. It is hoped that the relevant departments that caused this loss will investigate the responsibility and learn from the lessons.

### 解放农业社今年甘蔗为什么缺苗？

    解放农业社今年甘蔗为什么缺苗？编辑同志：
    四川简阳县解放农业生产合作社，今年各种庄稼长得都比去年好，唯独甘蔗地远不如去年。是不是今年自然条件不宜于甘蔗生长呢？不是的，这是人为的灾害！
    事情发生的原因是这样：去年快要收割甘蔗的时候，解放农业生产合作社接到供销社的通知：“为了提高蔗糖的质量，确定甘蔗比往年迟砍一个月（往年收割在十月下旬）。”但是还没等到十一月下旬，寒流袭来了。有经验的社员们，当气温刚刚下降的时候就建议马上把甘蔗砍倒窖存，防止受冻，以免影响糖分和明年播种。社管理委员会研究后认为这意见是正确的，但因和供销社有合同关系，立即向供销社征求意见。供销社经过请示，答复是：“照前规定时间收割。”后来又经过几次交涉，供销社终于拒绝接受这个正确的要求。这时有些单干农民就自行砍收起来了，而农业社因服从合同，不敢动手。直到寒流连续袭来，才急忙砍收，但已无法挽救，大部甘蔗都受冻了。结果糖分质量减低，影响了糖厂出糖量；社里留的蔗种，除芦蔗（土种）半数以上还能发芽外，良蔗的芽苞大部冻坏不能做种了。今年的蔗种，是供销社设法从内江购运来的。但是，这个迟砍甘蔗的决定在内江区是统一布置的，所以购来的蔗种也同样受了冻害，下种以后的出苗率仅有百分之四十七，缺窝现象严重。社里虽然及时补种了玉米（补种甘蔗时间已晚），甘蔗的生产已受到极大损失，甘蔗苗生长高低不匀，缺苗严重地块玉米多于甘蔗，看去像是在玉米地里间种甘蔗。社管委会最近作了试算，预计今年每亩良蔗产量只有三千八百多斤，比去年减产百分之六十一点八，芦蔗每亩产量只有六千四百多斤，比去年减产百分之二十三，比今年计划减少更多。总计全社甘蔗减产约六十万斤，损失七千多元；加上向外购种运费，合计在九千元左右，每户社员平均减少收入二十七元左右。更为严重的是，内江种蔗的许多地区都受到了类似的损失。
    任何农业技术措施的决定和实施，都必须根据当地自然条件和群众经验，特别是当自然情况有变化时，更应及时改变已经不适宜的措施，这已经是用不着再加说明的道理。当地供销社这个决定在一般情况下是正确的，迟些砍是能够提高蔗糖质量的。但是，当自然条件发生变化、寒流预报发出的时候，供销社的有关部门没有根据甘蔗怕冻的一般经验，主动改变原来决定；相反的，却是主观机械地硬要贯彻这一决定。更为严重的是寒流已经袭来，社员群众纷纷要求赶快砍收时，他们仍然不理会群众意见，以致造成这样严重的损失。这种错误不仅是官僚主义问题，而且是主观主义到近于“专横”的程度。这种对待群众生产事业的态度，同我们党和国家对农民生产的积极领导是毫无相同之处的。希望造成这一损失的有关部门，查明责任，吸取教训。　张鲁山
