    Cannot Blindly Worship Technology
    Lin Hong
    During the period of national planned economic construction, scientific and technological personnel are receiving even greater attention from the Party and the state. Without a large number of personnel who have mastered modern science and technology, even if we have abundant resources, sufficient funds, and certain technical equipment, we will not be able to smoothly complete the national economic construction plan and build our country into a socialist industrialized nation. However, what our Party and state value and cherish are those scientific and technological personnel who are loyal to the country and the people. This is because science and technology can only be used to serve the country and the people when they are in the hands of those who are loyal to the country and the people. Conversely, if they are in the hands of counter-revolutionaries, they will use science and technology to undermine our socialist economic construction. It should be admitted that the vast majority of scientific and technological personnel are loyal to the country and the people, and they are working hard to promote the country's construction. However, it cannot be denied that a small number of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements are also hidden among scientific and technological personnel, and they are trying to use technology to carry out counter-revolutionary activities every day and every hour. Therefore, when we receive and appoint technical personnel, we should, like other personnel, conduct a conscientious and responsible review of their politics and history. Only through careful review can we promptly expose and deal with those counter-revolutionaries who are disguised as "technical personnel" and attempt to infiltrate state organs and enterprises. As for those technical personnel who have had some problems in the past but have honestly confessed to the organization, or who have no problems in history but have some shortcomings in their ideological style, we can boldly use them according to the needs of the work and transform them in the work. In our revolutionary camp, many comrades understand the above-mentioned principles, so they conduct a conscientious review of the political history of technical personnel when they represent the organization to receive and appoint personnel. However, many comrades, because of blindly worshipping technology and believing in "technical omnipotence," ignore the review of the political history of technical personnel. It is often seen that many organs, enterprises, and cultural, educational, and health departments, when receiving and appointing personnel, often only pay attention to whether they have culture and technology, and rarely consider, or even do not consider at all, their political qualities; after receiving them, they blindly trust them, and rarely or never check their work. This erroneous practice of "only wanting technology, not politics" has not only allowed some counter-revolutionaries disguised as "technical personnel" to infiltrate our ranks, but also allowed them to unscrupulously use technology to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities after they have infiltrated our ranks. The reason why Wang Pichang, Liu Zheng, and Li Zongquan, counter-revolutionaries hidden in the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, were able to seize the important positions of "doctors" and "directors" and successively used technology to kill dozens of people is inseparable from the blind worship of technology by Zhang Zhengquan, the president of the hospital and a member of the Communist Party. Although Zhang Zhengquan clearly knew the criminal history of Wang Pichang and others, he did not raise his vigilance against them because of this. Instead, he believed that their service as "military doctors" in the Kuomintang bandit army was a manifestation of their "experience" and "technology," and he trusted and valued them very much, personally promoting them to important positions. Many staff members of this hospital had raised objections to Zhang Zhengquan because of this. However, he not only did not adopt everyone's correct opinions, but also openly said such things at the hospital's staff meeting: "Only by learning technology well can you be promoted. If some people want to compare, they should see how their technology is. People have high levels because they have served as military medical officers and presidents (referring to the positions held by counter-revolutionaries such as Wang Pichang in the Chiang bandit army). Who of you has taken such responsibility!" It was under the domination of this bourgeois ideology of "only wanting technology, not politics" and believing in "technical omnipotence" that Zhang Zhengquan did not suspect that the "medical accidents" created by Wang Pichang and others were counter-revolutionary sabotage, allowing them to dare to use technology to kill people again and again. Even more seriously, some leaders of state organs have reached such an alarming degree of believing in technology that they not only do not seriously review the political history of the technical personnel they receive, but also do not pay attention to investigating whether these personnel really have technology. As long as they hear that someone is a graduate of a specialized school, especially a scholar or expert, they immediately receive them as staff members. Tianjin once exposed such an incident: a person claimed to be a Doctor of Medicine, a brain surgery expert, and a "Nobel Prize winner." The relevant departments in Tianjin hired him as the director of brain surgery and professor of the medical school of Tianjin General Hospital, and not only sent him abroad to purchase medical equipment, but also specially allocated funds to build an operating room for him, trusting and valuing this "high-level technical talent" very much. However, this person's various titles of "doctor," "master," and "Nobel Prize winner" were originally fabricated and he was a swindler. Therefore, during the period when he infiltrated Tianjin General Hospital, the mortality rate of patients who underwent surgery by him averaged as high as 30%, and the mortality rate of patients who underwent brain surgery by him was even as high as 50%.
    Even more seriously, some heads of organs, enterprises, and cultural, educational, and health departments even have such absurd ideas: as long as the work needs and production needs, as long as they have culture and technology, even counter-revolutionaries should be used. In fact, some organs, enterprises, schools, and hospitals have already received some counter-revolutionaries under the domination of this view, or allowed counter-revolutionaries who have been sentenced to imprisonment to take charge of responsible and key work. The Kailuan Coal Mine once used Zhong Yin, a counter-revolutionary criminal who had been sentenced to imprisonment with a suspended sentence, to be responsible for the technical guidance of the combined coal mining machine, and as a result, the combined coal mining machine was sabotaged twice in a row. The leading cadres of the Datong Mining Bureau in Shanxi also once, due to a lack of surveying and mapping personnel, requested Zhao Xingren, a counter-revolutionary criminal who had been sentenced to imprisonment by the People's Court, to return from the labor reform team and reassign him to work, so that this counter-revolutionary was able to continue to use technology to carry out sabotage. Recently, in this mining bureau, another case of hidden counter-revolutionaries Pan Zhirong and Hua Junwen using technology to sabotage the Datong "Goose Feather Mouth" and "Baitu Kiln" two geological data testing tasks was uncovered. The testing of the geological data of "Goose Feather Mouth" and "Baitu Kiln" is a major political task directly related to the coal mine construction projects in these two places; however, due to the malicious sabotage of counter-revolutionaries, most of the coal samples that have been made need to be reworked, and some have no original data and need to be re-drilled, which has caused a direct economic loss of more than one million yuan to the state. The circumstances of this counter-revolutionary sabotage case are of course serious and egregious; however, when the Datong Mining Bureau discovered Pan Zhirong's counter-revolutionary criminal behavior and decided to revoke his position as "Director of the Laboratory," some administrative leaders were still saying: "There are many tasks piled up in the laboratory, and it won't work without Pan Zhirong." They advocated that after Pan Zhirong's "Director" position was revoked, he should still be kept in the laboratory as a technician. This fully shows that some leaders of the Datong Mining Bureau, although they adopted the suicidal practice of "quenching thirst with poison" in the past and caused significant losses to the cause of the country and the people, they have not seriously learned their lessons and are still willing to continue to "quench thirst with poison." Of course, the hidden counter-revolutionaries Pan Zhirong and Hua Junwen were finally arrested by the People's Court according to law, and some leaders of the Datong Mining Bureau also began to realize the mistake of "only caring about business and not asking about politics."
    Why is it that some Communist Party members, and even some Communist Party members who are in leadership positions, blindly worship technology and believe in technology? Don't they even understand the simple principle that technology must be subordinate to politics? Some comrades lack experience in class struggle and do not understand that counter-revolutionaries will also use technology to carry out assassination and sabotage activities; some comrades do not understand, but do not admit the existence of class struggle. In their minds, there is an extremely strange idea, that is: with the greater victories we achieve on the economic construction front, and with the more consolidated our people's democratic dictatorship becomes, it seems that the class struggle in our country is not becoming more acute and complex, but is becoming more缓和, and even if there are still a few counter-revolutionaries in the country, they have become docile and harmless. It is under the domination of this decadent and extremely harmful idea that some comrades have actually said such class-less words as "as long as the work needs and production needs, as long as they have culture and technology, even counter-revolutionaries should be used," which makes them unscrupulously put counter-revolutionaries who have been sentenced to imprisonment in important and key positions. Therefore, we believe that in order to prevent the continued occurrence of such suicidal incidents of "quenching thirst with poison" in the future, we must not only explain to these comrades the principle that technology is subordinate to politics, but also explain to them from the Marxist-Leninist class theory, so that they understand that today in our country, not only are there still classes and class struggles, but this struggle is becoming increasingly acute and complex, and our enemies have increasingly adopted the two-faced method of drilling into the liver. And in order to prevent hidden counter-revolutionaries from infiltrating our ranks, we must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, resolutely eliminate the bourgeois ideology of "only wanting technology, not politics" and believing in "technical omnipotence," and conduct a serious review of the political history of any new personnel, as well as their technology and work ability.

    不能盲目崇拜技术
    林洪
    在国家有计划的经济建设时期，科学技术人材更加受到党和国家的重视。因为没有大量掌握了现代科学技术的人材，纵使我们有着丰富的资源、充裕的资金和一定技术装备，也无法顺利地完成国民经济建设计划，把我们的国家建设成为一个社会主义工业化的国家。但是我们党和国家所重视和爱护的是那些忠于国家和忠于人民的科学技术人材。这是因为科学技术只有掌握在那些忠实于国家和人民的人的手里，他们才会利用科学技术来为国家和人民服务；相反的，如果掌握在反革命分子的手里，他们就会利用科学技术来破坏我们的社会主义经济建设。应该承认，科学技术人员中绝大多数是忠于国家和人民的，他们正在为推进国家的建设事业而努力工作。但是也不能否认，在科学技术人员中间也隐藏着少数反革命分子和其他坏分子，他们每日每时都在企图利用技术进行反革命的活动。因此，我们在接收和任用技术人员时，也应该像对待其他的人员一样，必须对他的政治、历史作认真负责的审查。只有经过认真地审查，才能及时地揭发和处理那些披着“技术人员”外衣，企图混进国家机关和企业部门的反革命分子。至于那些历史上有些问题，但是已忠诚老实地向组织作了交代，或者历史上没有什么问题，只是思想作风上还有些缺点的技术人员，我们就可以根据工作的需要大胆地使用他们，并在工作中改造他们。在我们的革命阵营内部，有许多同志是懂得上述道理的，因而他们在代表组织接收和任用人员时，对技术人员的政治历史进行了认真的审查。但是，也有不少同志因为盲目崇拜技术，迷信“技术万能”，就忽视了对技术人员政治历史的审查。经常可以看到不少机关、企业和文教卫生部门在接收和任用人员时，常常只注意他们是否有文化、有技术，至于他们的政治品质如何，就很少考虑，甚至根本不考虑；接收进来后，又对他们盲目地信任，很少或者根本就没有检查过他们的工作情况。这种“只要技术，不要政治”的错误作法，不但已经使一些披着“技术人员”外衣的反革命分子混进了我们内部，而且让他们混入我们内部以后，可以毫无顾忌地利用技术进行反革命破坏活动。暗藏在石家庄专区第一人民医院的反革命分子王丕昌、刘正和李宗泉，所以能够窃踞了“医师”、“主任”的重要职位，先后利用技术杀害了几十条人命，就是和这个医院的院长、共产党员张政权盲目崇拜技术分不开的。张政权虽然明明知道王丕昌等人的罪恶历史，但是他并没有因此引起对他们的警惕，反而认为他们在国民党匪军中当过“军医”是他们“有经验”、“有技术”的表现，对他们非常信任和器重，亲手把他们提拔起来担任重要的职务。这个医院的许多工作人员曾因此向张政权提出过意见。但是，他不仅不采纳大家的正确意见，而且公然在全院的工作人员大会上说出了这样的话：“只有学好技术才能提拔。有的人要比，应该看看自己的技术如何。人家级别高，因为当过军队医官、院长（指王丕昌等反革命分子在蒋匪军中所任职务），你们谁负过这样的责任！”正是在这种“只要技术，不要政治”和迷信“技术万能”的资产阶级思想的支配之下，张政权没有怀疑过王丕昌等人所一手制造的“医疗事故”是反革命的破坏，使他们敢于一次又一次地利用技术杀害人命。还有少数国家机关的领导人员，迷信技术已达到了这样可惊的程度，他们不但不认真地审查所接收的技术人员的政治历史，而且连这些人员是否真正有技术也不注意考察。只要听说一个人是什么专科学校毕业的，特别是什么学者、专家，就立即接收为工作人员。天津市就曾经揭发过这样一个事件：有一个人自称是医学博士、脑外科专家，又是“诺贝尔奖金获得者”，天津市的有关部门便把他聘请为天津市总医院的脑外科主任兼医学院教授，不但派他出国采购过医疗器材，而且还特地拨款为他修建了手术室，对这个“高级技术人材”十分信任和器重。但是这个人的“博士”、“硕士”和“诺贝尔奖金获得者”的种种头衔原来都是伪造的，是一个骗子，因而在他混入天津市总医院的期间，经他施行手术的患者的死亡率竟平均高达百分之三十，其中经他做脑部手术的患者的死亡率更高达百分之五十。
    更为严重的是，有些机关、企业和文教卫生部门的负责人竟然有这样荒谬的想法：只要工作需要和生产需要，只要有文化、有技术，就是反革命分子也要用。事实上，有些机关、企业、学校和医院已经在这种观点的支配之下，把一些反革命分子也接收了进去，或者让已经被判处徒刑的反革命分子担任负责的和要害的工作。开滦煤矿曾经使用被判处徒刑、缓期执行的反革命犯钟茵来负责联合采煤机的技术指导工作，因而连续两次发生了联合采煤机被破坏的事件。山西大同矿务局的领导干部，也曾经因为缺乏测绘人员，把一个已经被人民法院判处徒刑的反革命犯赵兴仁从劳动改造队要回去重新分配了工作，因而使得这个反革命分子能够继续利用技术进行破坏。最近在这个矿务局里，又破获了一件暗藏的反革命分子潘志荣、华骏文利用技术破坏大同“鹅毛口”、“白土窑”两项地质资料化验任务的案件。对于“鹅毛口”、“白土窑”两项地质资料的化验，是直接关系着这两处的煤矿工程建设的重大政治任务；但是由于反革命分子的恶意破坏，致使已做出的煤样大部需要返工重做，有的已经没有了原始资料，需要重新打钻，这就给国家在经济上造成的直接损失达一百多万元。这个反革命破坏案件的情节当然是重大恶劣的；但是在大同矿务局发觉了潘志荣的反革命犯罪行为，决定要撤销他的“化验室主任”的职务时，有些行政领导人员还在说：“化验上堆着很多任务，离开潘志荣可不行。”他们主张在撤销潘志荣的“主任”职务后，仍然要留他在化验室当技术员。这就充分说明了，大同矿务局的一些领导人虽然在过去采用“饮鸩止渴”的自杀做法，曾经给国家和人民的事业造成过重大的损失，但是他们并未认真地记取教训，还是愿意继续“饮鸩止渴”。当然，暗藏的反革命分子潘志荣和华骏文最后还是被人民法院依法逮捕了，大同矿务局的一些领导人也开始认识到“只顾业务，不问政治”的错误。
    为什么一部分共产党员、甚至一部分担负领导工作的共产党员是那样盲目地崇拜技术、迷信技术呢？难道他们连技术必须服从于政治这个浅显的道理都不懂得吗？一部分同志是由于缺乏阶级斗争的经验，还不懂得反革命分子也会利用技术来进行暗害和破坏活动；一部分同志不是不懂，而是不承认阶级斗争的存在。在他们的头脑中有一种极为奇怪的想法，这就是：随着我们在经济建设战线上获得的胜利愈大，随着我们的人民民主专政的愈加巩固，似乎我国国内的阶级斗争不是愈加尖锐和复杂了，而是愈加缓和了，国内即使还有几个反革命分子，也已经变得驯服不伤人了。正是在这种腐朽的极其有害的思想支配之下，才使得一些同志居然说出了“只要工作需要和生产需要，只要有文化、有技术，就是反革命分子也要用”的毫无阶级立场的话，才使得他们毫无顾忌地把判了徒刑的反革命分子也摆在重要的和要害的部位上。因此我们认为，要在今后防止这类“饮鸩止渴”自杀事件的继续发生，不但要给这些同志讲解技术服从于政治的道理，而且要给他们从马克思列宁主义阶级学说讲起，要使他们懂得：今天在我们的国家里，不但还有着阶级和阶级斗争，而且这种斗争正在日趋尖锐和复杂，我们的敌人已经愈来愈多地采取了钻进肝脏的两面派手法。而我们要防止暗藏的反革命分子混进我们的内部，就必须百倍地提高革命警惕性，坚决肃清“只要技术，不要政治”和迷信“技术万能”的资产阶级思想，对任何新来人员的政治历史以及他们的技术和工作能力都要作认真的审查。
