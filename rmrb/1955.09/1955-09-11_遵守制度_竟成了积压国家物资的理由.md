"Abiding by the System" Actually Becomes a Reason for Hoarding National Materials
Editor:

    The Liuzhou Railway Bureau Communications Workshop has a large number of telephone lines that have not been used for a long time. Some of these lines were not dismantled in time after the institutions were abolished, and some were never used for calls after they were erected. For example, there are 13 redundant lines in Liuzhou city alone, totaling 98 "tiao gongli" (Note: "tiao gongli" is a unit of line length), which alone ties up more than 55,000 yuan of funds. The electric wires near the Liujiang River Bridge, erected in 1951, included 18 "tiao gongli" originally intended to be rented to the post and telecommunications bureau. Because a contract was not settled in advance, the post and telecommunications bureau did not rent them after the wires were erected, and these wires have been idle ever since. The Liubei Forestry Management Office erected 12 "tiao gongli" of telephone lines in 1950, and although the institution was abolished in August 1952, the telephone lines have never been dismantled. Of the 28 pairs of wires between poles number one and eight for the telephone lines used by the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, 24 pairs have been idle for a long time. In 1952, three poles more than ten meters high were erected at the Liuzhou station where a gatehouse for the level crossing was planned, and wires were strung, but the gatehouse has not yet been built, so these poles and lines have never been used. Originally, some newly established units needed lines and could have utilized these facilities, but some leading staff members used the excuse that this was "fixed capital, which cannot be moved casually according to the system"; those involved also believed that dismantling and moving fixed assets would require changing all the ledgers and plans, which was too troublesome. Under this excuse, national funds have been tied up for a long time.

    The failure to promptly dispose of these idle lines not only ties up a large amount of funds, but also wastes maintenance manpower. The Liuzhou Second Communications Workshop spent 200 work hours in June of this year maintaining these idle lines. Communications worker Li Yu said: "I have been inspecting these idle lines for more than a year. If they were dismantled, the materials could be used, and manpower would be saved. Why doesn't the leadership do this?" The relevant leading departments of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau should answer this question.

### “遵守制度”竟成了积压国家物资的理由

    “遵守制度”竟成了积压国家物资的理由编辑同志：
    柳州铁路管理局通讯工区，有大量电话线路长期没有被利用。这些线路有的是机构撤销后没有及时拆除的，有的是架设后根本没有通话的。如柳州市内就有十三条共长九十八条公里（按：条公里是线路长度单位）的线路是多余的，仅这一项就积压资金五万五千多元。一九五一年架设的柳江大桥附近的电线，其中有十八条公里原来准备租给邮电局用，由于事先没有订妥合同，架完电线后邮电局不租，这些电线就一直空闲着。柳北林木管理所在一九五○年架设了十二条公里电话线，一九五二年八月这个机构撤销后，电话线却一直没拆除。柳州铁路管理局机关用的电话线，在一号到八号电杆间的二十八对电线中，有二十四对长期闲置。一九五二年柳州站场在预备盖板道闸楼的地方树了三根十多公尺高的电杆，架了电线，但是到现在闸楼还未盖好，这些杆线也就从来没有用过。本来，有些新成立的单位需要线路，是可以利用这些设备的，但是，有的领导工作人员借口这是“固定资金，按制度不能随便动”；当事人也认为，拆移固定资产，要变更全部台账和计划，手续太麻烦。在这种借口下，国家的资金就被长期积压下来了。
    这些空闲线路没有及时处理，不仅积压了大批资金，还要浪费维修人力。柳州第二通讯工区今年六月份就有二百个工时花在维修这些空闲线路上。通讯工李玉说：“我巡检这些空闲的线路已经一年多了。如果把它拆了，材料既可利用，还节省人力。领导上为什么不这样做呢？”柳州铁路管理局的有关领导部门应该回答这个问题。
