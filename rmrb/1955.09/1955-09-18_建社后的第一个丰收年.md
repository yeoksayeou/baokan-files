Agricultural production cooperatives generally have bumper harvests

    The First Year of Abundant Harvest After Establishing the Cooperative

    Anyone who visits the No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huayuanzha Township, East Suburb District, Beijing, will be attracted by the scene of a bumper harvest as soon as they enter the courtyard.

    In the courtyard, old ladies, girls, and children are sitting next to piles of corn, husking it. Before they finish husking this pile, carts of corn are constantly being unloaded in front of them.

    Seeing this year's bumper harvest, the cooperative members cannot help but recall the situation last autumn after the cooperative was established: each household's corn was dry and thin, yielding only one or two hundred catties per mu, but the cooperative's corn yielded three or four hundred catties! Party member Li Baokui and Ren Baoshan, Bi Youlong, and others discussed establishing an agricultural production cooperative. At this time, people from the district committee also came to help establish the cooperative; thus, the No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huayuanzha was established.

    Thanks to the tireless labor of the cooperative members, a bumper harvest was finally achieved. The corn yield of the No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Huayuanzha Township broke the highest annual yield record in the suburbs of Beijing, with high-yield corn yielding 750 catties per mu. According to cooperative director Li Baokui, the corn yield here had never exceeded 350 catties, and sorghum in the low-lying areas used to yield only one hundred catties, but this year it yielded more than 240 catties.

    Encouraged by the bumper harvest, the footprints of some individual farmers also often appear at the edge of the courtyard of the No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Huayuanzha Township. They found cooperative director Li Baokui and said: "Let me join the cooperative after the autumn harvest. It's really good to be organized!" Li Baokui said: "We welcome you!"

专栏：农业生产合作社普遍大丰收

    建社后的第一个丰收年
    到北京市东郊区花园闸乡第一农业生产合作社的人，一走进场院，都会被丰收景象所吸引住。
    场院上，老大娘、姑娘、小孩子们正坐在玉米堆旁边剥玉米，他们还没把这堆剥完，一车车玉米又不断地卸在跟前了。
    社员们看见今年丰收，都情不自禁地回想起去年秋后建社时的情况：各家玉米又干又瘦，每亩地打个百八十斤，可是人家合作社有打三、四百斤的！党员李宝魁和任宝山、毕有隆等就商量成立个农业生产合作社。这时，区委也来人帮助建社；于是花园闸第一农业生产合作社就建立起来了。
    由于社员们不疲倦的劳动，终于获得了丰收。花园闸乡第一农业合作社的玉米，突破了京郊最高年产量，高产玉米每亩收七百五十斤。据社主任李宝魁说：这里的玉米产量从来没超过三百五十斤，洼地高粱过去总打百十斤，今年打到了二百四十多斤。
    在丰产的鼓舞下，花园闸乡第一农业合作社的场边上也经常出现一些个体农民的足迹。他们找到社主任李宝魁说：秋后社里挂我个名吧，组织起来真是好！李宝魁说：“我们欢迎！”
