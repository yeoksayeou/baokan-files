Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. Workers in factories and mines in the capital are further launching labor competitions to welcome National Day. Good news of their striving to complete and overfulfill national production plans are constantly coming. In recent days, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has overfulfilled its pig iron production plan every day. The workers of Jingxi Chengzi Coal Mine overfulfilled the production plan for the first half of September, producing more than 1,900 tons of raw coal. One cement kiln at the Liulihe Cement Plant created the highest record of cement production since the plant was built on the 11th and 12th. On the gift-giving platform of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory celebrating National Day, the red stars representing workshops and teams creating new production records had increased to 142 by the 22nd. The newly built state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory's fine yarn workshop in the second district, which went into production on September 16, has completed its production tasks according to plan every day for the past five days, without producing a single defective yarn, and saving 440 centimeters of raw cotton every day; the rate of first-class cloth produced by the weaving workshop has reached 100%.

By September 19, 124 youth commando teams on various construction sites in Beijing had completed or overfulfilled their production tasks, realizing their plan to present gifts to the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference and National Day.

Suburban farmers have reaped a bumper harvest this year. Suburban youth have universally launched a movement to pick up five kilograms of grain per person in the harvesting of autumn crops. The grain-picking team composed of 110 young people from the Zhangguozhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to pick up 1,500 kilograms of grain before National Day.

This newspaper reports that workers in many state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and enterprises in Tianjin are deeply launching labor competitions to welcome National Day. Inspired by the slogan "Further Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign to Welcome National Day," the workers of the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory proposed 35 measures to save and improve quality on the 17th alone. Each workshop has organized a gift-giving platform to promptly publicize the new production achievements of the workers. The "crankshaft" of the 5341 gasoline engine produced by the foundry workshop of the state-owned Tianjin Automobile Parts Factory had quality problems that had not been resolved for a long time. In September, under the enthusiastic encouragement of welcoming National Day, veteran technicians proposed two measures to improve the "water riser" and add "chill irons." After adoption, 60 "crankshafts" were trial-produced without a single defective product.

This newspaper reports that Shenyang workers are actively launching labor competitions to welcome National Day.

The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant recently produced six 1A62 lathes as gifts to National Day. The carpentry youth commando team of the 387 construction site of the Second Engineering District of the Shenyang No. 3 Construction Engineering Company guarantees that long materials will not be cut short and that the remaining material heads will be used as much as possible, which can save 0.31 cubic meters of wood per week; the plastering youth commando team guarantees to actively promote advanced plastering experience, and the weekly plan will be completed half a day to one day in advance, and the project quality will reach 96 points. All members of these two commando teams guarantee that the attendance rate during National Day will reach 100%. On the basis of fully completing the production increase and thrift plan in August, the Shenyang Locomotive Depot put forward guarantee conditions for welcoming National Day in September, guaranteeing to save locomotive coal. By September 11, the locomotive depot had saved 72 tons of locomotive coal, and the entire depot eliminated coal-consuming locomotives. From September 1 to 12, the workers of the fifth workshop of the Shenyang Cotton Weaving Factory saved 6,400 yards of canvas. To welcome National Day, all the workers in the thermal power workshop of the Shenyang Glass Bottle Factory improved the operation method of the gas furnace, which can save the country more than 360 tons of good coal a year.

Xinhua News Agency reports that factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites in Lanzhou are deeply launching labor competitions to welcome National Day. The Northwest Wool Textile Factory paid attention to learning and mastering new technologies in the competition, and each workshop comprehensively overfulfilled its production plan in the first half of September. The workers in the fitter, forging, and other workshops of the Gansu Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant have recently improved more than a dozen tools, which improved production efficiency. It is expected that the 10,000 mountain plows planned to be produced in the third quarter can be completed in advance.
