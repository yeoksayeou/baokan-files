    Promoting White Rosin Size
    Jiang Jinchun
    Currently, many paper mills across the country are using white rosin size instead of brown neutral size to make paper. This is an advanced experience introduced to our country by Soviet experts in 1953. Promoting this advanced experience can increase the water resistance of paper and improve its quality.
    The water resistance of paper is one of the main criteria for assessing paper quality. If the water resistance of paper used for cultural and printing purposes is not up to standard, the writing in documents will be blurred. If the water resistance of paper used for industrial purposes does not meet the standard, industrial raw materials or equipment will be damaged due to moisture. In the past, paper produced by many paper mills in our country using old methods was often unusable because its water resistance was not up to standard. After promoting the advanced experience of adding white rosin size, the problem of paper's water resistance was successfully solved.
    Using white rosin size can also greatly reduce the consumption of raw materials and lower costs. After using white rosin size, the state-owned Shixian Paper Mill can save 50 tons of rosin and about 20 tons of alum annually, worth 20,000 yuan. If this advanced experience is universally promoted nationwide, it can save the country at least 1.5 million yuan each year.

    推行白色松香胶
    姜锦春
    目前全国已有许多造纸工厂用白色松香胶代替褐色中性胶来造纸，这是一九五三年苏联专家介绍给我国的先进经验。推行这个先进经验，可以增加纸张的抗水度，提高纸张的质量。
    纸张的抗水度是鉴定纸张质量的主要标准之一。文化印刷用纸的抗水度如果不够标准，书写的文件字迹就要模糊；工业用纸如果不符合抗水标准，工业原料或器材就要因潮湿而造成损失。过去我国许多造纸厂用旧方法造出的纸张往往因抗水度不够标准而不能使用，推行了加白色松香胶的先进经验后，纸张的抗水度问题就顺利地解决了。
    使用白色松香胶，还可以大大减少原料的消耗量，降低成本。国营石岘造纸厂使用白色松香胶后，全年可节约五十吨松香和二十吨左右的矾土，价值二万元。如果在全国范围内普遍推行这一先进经验，每年至少可以为国家节约一百五十万元。
