    National Railways Trial Implementation of Freight Express Delivery Measures

    In order to meet the needs of national economic development and accelerate the exchange of materials, the Ministry of Railways will, starting from September 1st, implement domestic freight express delivery measures on a trial basis nationwide with a focus on key areas. All railway stations nationwide that handle direct through-train freight business will handle full-car freight express delivery business. In addition, thirty-three major freight stations under the jurisdiction of the Harbin, Jinzhou, Tianjin, Jinan, and Shanghai Railway Administrations are designated to handle less-than-carload freight express delivery business among themselves. All full-car livestock, perishable goods, and less-than-carload freight (excluding dangerous goods) with each piece weighing no more than 200 kilograms and each batch not exceeding two metric tons can be handled according to the express delivery measures. Express delivery freight will be given priority in transportation, with a transportation speed 70 kilometers per day faster than ordinary full-car freight and 100 kilometers per day faster than ordinary less-than-carload freight.

    全国铁路试行货物快运办法
    铁道部为了适应国民经济发展的需要，加速物资交流，从九月一日起，在全国范围内有重点地试行国内货物快运办法。凡全国铁路办理直通整车货运业务的车站，都办理整车货物的快运业务，另外还指定哈尔滨、锦州、天津、济南、上海各铁路管理局管辖的三十三个主要货运车站相互间办理零担货物的快运业务。凡是整车的禽畜类、易腐货物，以及每件重量在二百公斤以内，每批不超过两公吨的零担货物（危险货物除外），都可以按照快运办法办理。快运货物优先运送，运送速度比普通整车货物运送速度每天快七十公里，比普通零担货物运送速度每天快一百公里。
