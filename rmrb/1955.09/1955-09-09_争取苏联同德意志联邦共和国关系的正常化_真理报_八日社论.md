Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 8th (TASS dispatch)

The negotiations between the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, headed by Chancellor Adenauer, and the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are scheduled to begin in Moscow on September 9th.

Broad sections of societies in all countries are paying close attention to these negotiations. The Soviet Union's initiative to normalize relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is widely regarded as a significant contribution to easing international tensions. The interests of peace and European security, as well as the national interests of the Soviet and German peoples, all require the establishment of normal and good relations between the two countries.

The Soviet people harbor no ill will toward the German people. Although there have been dark phases in the history of Soviet-German relations, the Soviet people have never forgotten the years of friendly relations and cooperation between the two peoples, from which both countries greatly benefited. Suffice it to mention that in 1932, the Soviet Union ranked second in Germany's exports and third in Germany's imports.

On the other hand, historical experience shows that the past hostility and wars between the Soviet Union and Germany brought them endless suffering. Suffice it to recall that in the past two world wars, the Soviet and German peoples suffered the greatest sacrifices.

In order to prevent the possible recurrence of such terrible disasters in the future, the Soviet Union unhesitatingly established friendly and good-neighborly relations with the German people after the end of the Second World War. This led to the close and friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, which is constantly developing on a solid foundation of equality and non-interference in internal affairs. Now that the so-called occupation statutes for West Germany have been abolished (these occupation statutes had greatly restricted its foreign relations), and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has passed a resolution on ending the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany and on establishing peaceful relations between the two countries, all this creates the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and the establishment of direct relations between the two countries.

The broadest German public welcomes the upcoming negotiations in Moscow and hopes that, through the personal contact of the national leaders of the two countries, concrete decisions can finally be made on the issue of normal diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The main task of these negotiations lies precisely here, and this task is very clear and understandable.

However, it would be wrong not to mention the fact that certain figures abroad are doing everything possible to create confusion on this issue, thereby complicating the completion of the tasks facing the participants in the negotiations. We are referring, first of all, to the attempts to make the solution of these tasks dependent, in one way or another, on some other issues, primarily the solution of the issue of German reunification.

However, it cannot be overlooked that attempts to complicate the solution of the issue of normalizing relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany by putting forward certain "preconditions" will never bring good results.

As for the issue of restoring German unity, the Soviet Union's position on this issue is very clear: the Soviet Union has always been, and still is, firmly in favor of reunifying Germany on a peaceful, democratic basis. However, everyone knows that there are now serious obstacles in the way of resolving this issue, and these obstacles are caused by those who, despite repeated warnings from the Soviet Union, insist on bringing the Paris Agreements into effect, the purpose of which is to remilitarize West Germany and make West Germany a member of the Western military bloc.

Now the Paris Agreements have come into effect and are being implemented. This has created a new situation that cannot be ignored. Proceeding from this new situation formed after the entry into force of the Paris Agreements, the Soviet Union put forward new proposals at the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers. The Soviet Union proposed to strive to gradually resolve the task of restoring German unity along the following path: easing international tensions in Europe, abolishing the existing military blocs, and establishing an effective all-European collective security system, initially with the participation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and later with the participation of a unified Germany.

Currently, there are various views among politicians in the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the path to restoring national unity. For example, everyone knows that the views of the Social Democratic Party, which represents nine million voters, differ from those of newspapers that reflect the opinions of government officials. The Social Democratic Party opposes the Paris Agreements and the Federal Republic's participation in the Atlantic Pact. Adenauer was unable to reach an agreement with the Social Democratic Party on the agenda of the upcoming negotiations precisely because of his differences with the Social Democratic Party on these extremely important issues.

The German Communist Party has always consistently defended the cause of restoring German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis. In this regard, one cannot fail to see the will of the working class and the broad masses of working people to restore Germany as a democratic and peaceful country.

To thoroughly resolve the German issue under the current conditions, the major powers, especially the German people themselves, must make tremendous and earnest efforts. Needless to say, in resolving the issue of German unity, the opinions of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany must be taken into account. In other words, under the current conditions, the solution to this issue depends primarily on the Germans themselves, on their joint efforts.

This means that under the current German and international conditions, it is impossible to restore its unity by mechanically merging the two parts of Germany. This plan will not succeed, and it is impossible to succeed, because it does not take into account the reality. Everyone understands that such attempts and plans can only produce negative results—delay, procrastination, and complication.

From this it can be seen that only those who are neither concerned about the normalization of relations nor concerned about the reunification of Germany advocate that the issue of normalizing relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany should depend on somehow resolving the issue of German reunification in advance. This attitude can only stem from the hope of pre-emptively causing the upcoming negotiations to fail.

Many facts show that these conspiracies exist. For example, in recent days, Western newspapers have been making great efforts to propagate the idea that it would seem not bad if, after the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, representatives from the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany formed some kind of... "mixed committee" in order to further "study" the issue of establishing diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations. This clumsy conspiracy completely exposes the true face of its planners: they have not considered taking practical steps at all to make the possibility of establishing normal and good relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany a reality.

Of course, this and similar conspiracies cause reasonable concern among German patriots, who fully understand that establishing normal relations with the Soviet Union is primarily in the interest of the Federal Republic of Germany, as this will provide a basis for cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, which will be a major contribution to the cause of restoring German unity.

For this reason, the broad public in West Germany is increasingly resolutely criticizing certain figures in Bonn for completely detaching themselves from reality and attempting to use the long-bankrupt policy of "positions of strength" in their diplomacy. The German people, who still have fresh memories of the defeat in the Second World War, are tired of this policy. They do not want to embark on another dangerous war adventure for the third time. Therefore, they unconditionally condemn any attempt to reuse this policy in one form or another.

As for the Soviet Union, it has always advocated, and still advocates, resolving the German issue on a peaceful and democratic basis.

Everyone knows that the Soviet government delegation clearly stated its position on this issue at the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers. The path pointed out by the Soviet government delegation makes it possible for the German people to avoid the serious threats brought about by the Paris Agreements and can open up for them the prospect of reunification into a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful Germany.

The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will help establish cooperation between the two countries, which will be a major contribution to consolidating peace and security in Europe and the world.

The Soviet people sincerely hope that the upcoming negotiations between the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will be successful. The Soviet people know that the Soviet side will make every effort to ensure that the negotiations achieve good results. Therefore, whether these negotiations will be successful depends on whether the other side has the same desire.

    争取苏联同德意志联邦共和国关系的正常化
    ——“真理报”八日社论
    以阿登纳总理为首的德意志联邦共和国政府代表团和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府之间的谈判定于九月九日在莫斯科开始举行。
    各国社会的广大阶层都密切注意这次谈判。苏联建议使苏联同德意志联邦共和国的关系正常化的主动精神，到处被认为是对缓和国际紧张局势的一个重大的贡献。和平和欧洲安全的利益以及苏德两国人民的民族利益都要求两国建立正常的和良好的关系。
    苏联人民对德国人民没有恶感。虽然在苏德关系史上曾经有过阴暗的阶段，但是苏联人民从来也没有忘记过，在两国人民之间存在友好关系和合作的年代，两国都得到了很大的好处。只要提起下面一点就够了：一九三二年苏联在德国的输出方面居第二位，而在德国的输入方面居第三位。
    另一方面，历史的经验说明，苏德两国过去曾经有过的敌对关系和战争，给他们带来了无穷的苦难。只要回忆这一点就够了：在过去两次世界大战中，正是苏德两国人民受到了最大的牺牲。
    苏联为了防止在将来可能重演这种可怕的灾难，在第二次世界大战结束之后就毫不犹豫地同德国人民建立友好和睦邻的关系。于是就产生了苏联同德意志民主共和国的密切而友好的合作，这种合作在平等和互不干涉内政的牢固基础上不断得到发展。现在，对西德的所谓占领法规已被取消（这一占领法规曾经大大地限制了它的外交关系），而苏联最高苏维埃也通过了关于结束苏联同德国的战争状态和关于建立两国之间的和平关系的决议，这一切都为苏联同德意志联邦共和国之间的关系正常化以及建立两国之间的直接关系创造了必要的条件。
    最广大的德国公众都欢迎将在莫斯科召开的谈判，并且希望由于两国国家领导人物的个人接触而终于能够就苏联同德意志联邦共和国之间的正常的外交、经济和文化关系问题作出具体的决定。这次谈判的主要任务正是在这里，这个任务是十分明确和可以理解的。
    不过，如果不提下面的事实，那是不对的，这就是：国外的某些人物千方百计地在这个问题上制造混乱，从而使谈判参加者所面临的任务的完成变得复杂和困难。我们指的首先是：有人企图使这些任务的解决在这种或那种关系上依赖于其他一些问题、首先是重新统一德国问题的解决。
    然而不能不看出，用提出某种“先决条件”的办法使苏联同德意志联邦共和国关系正常化的问题的解决复杂化，这种企图是绝不会带来良好的结果的。
    至于重新恢复德国的统一的问题，苏联在这个问题上的立场是十分明确的：苏联过去是，现在还是坚决主张使德国在和平、民主的基础上重新统一起来。然而大家知道，现在在解决这个问题的道路上是存在着严重的障碍的，这些障碍是由那些不顾苏联一再的警告坚持要使巴黎协定生效的人们所造成的，而巴黎协定的目的就是要使西德重新军国主义化和使西德参加西方国家的军事集团。
    现在巴黎协定已经生效，并且正在实现中。这就造成了一种不能忽视的新形势。苏联从巴黎协定生效后形成的这种新局面出发，在四国政府首脑日内瓦会议上提出了新的建议。苏联建议沿着下面的道路努力逐步解决恢复德国统一的任务，这条道路就是：缓和欧洲国际紧张局势，取消现存的军事集团，建立一个起初由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国参加，以后由统一的德国参加的、有效的全欧集体安全体系。
    现在，在德意志联邦共和国的政界人士中对恢复国家统一的道路存在着各种不同的观点。例如，大家都知道，代表九百万选民的社会民主党的观点是不同于反映政府人士意见的那些报纸的看法的。社会民主党反对巴黎协定，反对联邦共和国参加大西洋公约。阿登纳就是因为在这些极其重大的问题上同社会民主党有分歧而没有能够就即将举行的谈判的纲领同后者取得协议。
    德国共产党始终一贯地捍卫在民主和平的基础上恢复德国统一的事业。在这方面不能不看到工人阶级和广大劳动群众要求使德国恢复成为一个民主和平的国家的意志。
    要在当前条件下彻底解决德国问题，大国、特别是德国人民自己，必须作巨大的认真的努力。不用说，在解决德国统一的问题时，不能不考虑到德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的意见。换句话说，在现在的条件下，这个问题的解决首先取决于德国人自己、取决于他们的共同努力。
    这就是说，在当前的德国国内外条件下，不能通过机械地合并德国两部分的办法来恢复它的统
  一，这种打算是不会成功的，而且也不可能成功，因为它没有考虑到现实的情况。每个人都明白，这种企图和计划只能产生消极的结果——拖延、耽搁和复杂化。
    由此可知，只有那些既不关心关系正常化而又不关心德国恢复统一的人，才主张苏联同德意志联邦共和国的关系正常化的问题要取决于以某种方式事先解决德国统一的问题。这种态度只能是出于希望预先使将要举行的谈判失败。
    许多事实说明，这些阴谋是存在的。例如，最近几天西方报纸竭力宣扬一种主张，认为如果采取下面这种做法似乎很不坏：苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国谈判结束后，由苏联和德意志联邦共和国代表成立某种……“混合委员会”，以便进一步“研究”关于建立外交、经济和文化关系的问题。这种笨拙的阴谋完全暴露了它的策划者的真面目：他们根本没有考虑采取切实可行的步骤，使苏联和德意志联邦共和国建立正常和良好的关系的可能性。
    当然，这种以及类似的阴谋引起德国爱国人士的合理的忧虑，他们十分明白，同苏联建立正常关系首先是跟德意志联邦共和国有利害关系，因为这将为苏联和德意志联邦共和国的合作提供基础，从而对恢复德国统一的事业是一个重大的贡献。
    正因为如此，西德的广大公众越来越坚决地指责波恩某些人物完全脱离现实地企图在自己的外交中使用早已破产了的“实力地位”政策。对第二次世界大战中的失败记忆犹新的德国人民对这种政策已经厌倦了。他们不希望第三次从事危险的战争冒险。因此他们无条件地指责想以这种或那种形式重新使用这种政策的任何企图。
    至于苏联，它过去是，现在还是主张在和平和民主的基础上解决德国问题。
    大家知道，苏联政府代表团在四国政府首脑日内瓦会议上十分明确地阐明了自己对这个问题的立场。苏联政府代表团所指出的道路使德国人民有可能避免巴黎协定给他们带来的严重的威胁，并且可以为他们打开走向重新统一成为一个统一、独立、民主、和平的德国的前途。
    苏联同德意志联邦共和国之间的关系的正常化将有助于建立两国之间的合作，它将是对巩固欧洲以及全世界的和平和安全事业的一个重大贡献。
    苏联人民真诚地希望即将举行的苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府的谈判得到成功。苏联人知道，苏联这方面将尽一切努力来使谈判得到良好的结果。因此，这次谈判是否会成功还要看另一方是否也有同样的愿望。
