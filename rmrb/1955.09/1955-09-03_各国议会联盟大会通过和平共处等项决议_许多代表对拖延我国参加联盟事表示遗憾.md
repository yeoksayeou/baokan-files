Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, September 2nd: The 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union has passed a number of resolutions on the issues it discussed. These resolutions are of great significance for further easing international tensions and for establishing cooperation and trust between countries with different social systems.

    The resolution on the legal and moral principles of coexistence states that peaceful coexistence of all countries is in line with the aspirations of the people of all countries, and that peaceful coexistence requires the governments of all countries to abide by the norms of international law, in particular the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, and renunciation of imperialist plans and racial discrimination. The resolution calls on all countries to resolve disputes peacefully.

    The resolution on international security and disarmament adopted by the conference calls on parliaments around the world to exert influence on their governments to take actions conducive to the establishment of a collective security system for all countries. The conference calls for the supervision of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and conventional armaments, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the balanced reduction of armed forces, and the adoption of all measures to reach agreement on disarmament.

    The resolution on economic cooperation states that the development of economic cooperation is one of the main conditions for peaceful coexistence. The Inter-Parliamentary Union calls on national parliaments to organize a world conference in the near future to help reach agreement on issues such as the abolition of economic restrictions and the increase in the number of trade agreements.

    The resolution on cultural exchange calls on national parliaments to ratify the UNESCO Convention and the recommendations on the exchange of scientific and cultural information and freedom of action.

    The resolution on strengthening the Inter-Parliamentary Union notes with satisfaction the proposals contained in the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on establishing direct contacts between national parliaments. The conference urges all parliaments to pay attention to the need to enhance their authority and calls on national parliaments to strive to consolidate peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, September 1st: The newly elected Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held a meeting. According to "Helsinki News," the meeting reviewed the application of the People's Republic of China delegation to join the Union. However, the discussion did not result in any decision on this issue, but merely stated that the issue of admitting the People's Republic of China delegation to the Union would be re-examined at the Executive Committee meeting to be held in December this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, September 2nd: The 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, at its evening session on August 31st, elected representatives from Finland, the Soviet Union, Italy, Ceylon, and Iraq as new members of the Executive Committee, based on the recommendation of the Union Council. In addition to the representatives of the above five countries, the new Executive Committee also includes representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, and Switzerland.

    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, September 2nd: Representatives of many countries attending the 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union expressed regret over the Executive Committee of the Union delaying the participation of the People's Republic of China delegation in the Union.

    Lord Stansgate, Chairman of the Union Council, expressed great regret in his closing speech at the conference that China was excluded from this meeting. He pointed out that the participation of parliamentary groups from the Soviet Union and other countries in the Union increased the value of this meeting, but the goal of making the Union an organization including parliaments from all countries in the world has still not been achieved.

    Mikhailov, head of the Soviet delegation, stated in an interview with the Finnish News Agency that, after explaining the achievements of this session of the Union, he emphasized that many delegates supported China's participation in the Union. He said that the participation of China and the German Democratic Republic in the Union would only enhance the Union's prestige in world public opinion. China's participation should no longer be delayed at the next meeting of the Union.

    The issue of China's participation in the Union has been a central issue of general concern to parliamentarians from various countries from beginning to end. During the plenary session on the morning of August 30th, when the issue of strengthening the Union was discussed, with the exception of the US representative who used rude language that was extremely discordant with the atmosphere of the meeting to slander and attack China, almost all the speakers, including representatives from Poland, India, France, Yugoslavia, Sudan, and the Soviet Union, supported China's participation in the Union.

    各国议会联盟大会通过和平共处等项决议
    许多代表对拖延我国参加联盟事表示遗憾
    新华社二日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基二日讯：各国议会联盟第四十四届大会就它讨论的问题通过了一些决议，这些决议对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势、对于在不同社会制度的国家之间建立合作和信任具有重大的意义。
    关于共处的法律及道义原则的决议指出，一切国家的和平共处是符合一切国家人民的愿望的，和平共处要求所有国家的政府遵守国际法的准则、特别是遵守关于互相尊重领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政及放弃帝国主义计划和种族歧视的原则。决议要求各国和平地解决争端。
    大会通过的关于国际安全和裁军的决议要求世界各国议会对它们的政府施加影响，促使它们的政府采取有利于建立一切国家的集体安全体系的行动。大会要求对原子武器、氢武器和常规军备实行监督，禁止大规模毁灭性武器，均衡地裁减武装部队，并且采取一切措施就裁军问题达成协议。
    关于经济合作的决议说，经济合作的发展是和平共处的主要条件之一。各国议会联盟要求各国议会在最近的将来组织一次世界会议，这个会议将有助于在废除经济限制和增加贸易协定的数目等问题上达成协议。
    关于文化交流的决议要求各国议会批准联合国教育、科学及文化组织公约以及关于交换科学与文化情报和行动自由的建议。
    关于加强各国议会联盟的决议满意地指出苏联最高苏维埃宣言中所包含的关于各国议会之间建立直接接触的建议。大会促请所有的议会注意提高它们的权威的必要性，并且号召各国议会为巩固和平而努力。
    新华社二日讯　塔斯社赫尔辛基一日讯：各国议会联盟新选出的执行委员会举行了会议。据“赫尔辛基新闻”说，会议审查了中华人民共和国人民代表团要求参加联盟的申请。但是，讨论结果没有对这个问题作出任何决定，而只是指出：关于接纳中华人民共和国人民代表团加入联盟的问题，将在今年十二月召开的执行委员会会议上重新审查。
    新华社赫尔辛基二日电　各国议会联盟第四十四届大会在八月三十一日晚间会议上根据联盟理事会的建议，选举了芬兰、苏联、意大利、锡兰和伊拉克五个国家的代表为执行委员会新的委员。新执行委员会的组成除上述五个国家的代表外，还有美国、英国、泰国和瑞士四个国家的代表。
    据新华社赫尔辛基二日电　出席各国议会联盟第四十四届大会的许多国家的代表都对联盟执行委员会拖延中华人民共和国人民代表团参加联盟一事表示遗憾。
    联盟理事会主席斯坦斯盖特在大会闭幕词中对中国被排斥在这次会议之外表示极大的遗憾。他指出，苏联等国家的议员团参加联盟增加了这次会议的价值，但是，使联盟成为包括全世界各国议会的组织这样一个目标仍然没有达到。
    苏联代表团团长米哈伊洛夫对芬兰通讯社记者发表谈话，他在说明联盟本届大会的成就以后强调指出：许多代表都支持中国参加联盟。他说，中国和德意志民主共和国参加联盟只会提高联盟在世界舆论中的威信。在联盟的下次会议上，中国的参加是再也不应该被拖延了。
    中国参加联盟的问题自始至终是与会各国议会人士普遍关心的一个中心问题。在三十日上午的全体会议上讨论加强联盟的问题时，除了美国代表用和会议的气氛极不调和的粗暴语调对中国进行诬蔑和攻击外，包括波兰、印度、法国、南斯拉夫、苏丹、苏联等国家代表在内的几乎所有发言的代表，都支持中国参加联盟。
