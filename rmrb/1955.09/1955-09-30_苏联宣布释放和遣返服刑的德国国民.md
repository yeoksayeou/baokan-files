Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 29th: TASS reported from Moscow on September 29th: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued an announcement stating that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has considered the requests of the President and Government of the German Democratic Republic and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, which request the early release and repatriation of German nationals serving sentences for crimes committed against the peoples of the Soviet Union during the war.

The announcement stated that after the repatriation of German prisoners of war, as of September 1st of this year, there were still 9,626 former German prisoners of war and German nationals remaining on Soviet territory who had been convicted by Soviet courts for committing crimes. Considering that more than ten years have passed since the end of the war, and also considering that the convicted war criminals have already served a significant portion of their sentences, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR orders:

I. Eight thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven German nationals shall be exempted from serving the remainder of their sentences and shall be repatriated to the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany according to their respective places of residence.

II. Seven hundred and forty-nine German nationals shall be handed over to the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany as war criminals, according to their respective places of residence, because the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR believes that their crimes against the Soviet people were particularly serious and cannot be released before the expiration of their sentences.

    苏联宣布释放和遣返服刑的德国国民
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布公告说：苏联最高苏维埃主席团已经考虑了德意志民主共和国总统和政府的要求以及德意志联邦共和国政府的要求，它们要求提前释放和遣返在战争期间对苏联各族人民犯了罪行而在服刑的德国国民。
    公告说，在德国战俘被遣返之后，到今年九月一日，还有因为犯了罪行而被苏联法院判罪的九千六百二十六名前德国战俘和德国国民留在苏联领土上。考虑到自从战争结束以来，已经过去了十年多，又考虑到被判罪的战犯已经服了一大部分刑期，苏联最高苏维埃主席团命令：
    一、八千八百七十七名德国国民免服他们的刑期的剩下部分，并按照他们各自的居住地点，遣返到德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国。
    二、七百四十九名德国国民各按他们的居住地点、作为战犯移交给德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府，由于这些人对苏联人民所犯的罪行特别严重，苏联最高苏维埃主席团认为不能在刑期届满前释放他们。
