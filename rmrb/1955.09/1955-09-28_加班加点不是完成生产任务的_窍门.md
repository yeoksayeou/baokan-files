    Reader Chen Wenjue's letter reflects the serious overtime situation at the Fushun Longfeng Mine. This phenomenon is not isolated in factories and mines. For example, the Anshan Lingshan Agricultural Machinery Factory had more than 50,000 hours of overtime from January to July this year. The Wuhan Ship Repair Factory had more than 1,000 hours of overtime in May, of which the fitter's outside work team had overtime for 16 days out of 24 days from the 8th to the 31st. Fitter Cao Qiqiao worked continuously for 21 hours in the five days from the 21st to the 25th. When the Jinzhou Petroleum No. 6 Factory Engineering Team was constructing an underground sewer on August 20th, the workers were made to operate continuously for 22 hours. Some factories and mines even adopted disguised overtime methods such as "voluntary labor," "borrowing shifts," and "adjusting days off" to evade the state's restrictions on overtime.

    The reason for this phenomenon is that some enterprise leaders regard overtime as a "trick" to complete state plans. They believe that it is excusable to do so for the sake of production; however, they do not see or care about the serious harm that a large amount of overtime causes to workers' health and safety. For example, Zhang Qirui, the leader of the pipe group in the locomotive workshop of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and worker Pei Wenbin were both sick for more than ten days due to excessive overtime. Wang Wenyuan, a worker at the agricultural tool factory affiliated to the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry, had his finger crushed by a machine while working because of continuous overtime and excessive fatigue. In some factories and mines, workers' amateur cultural and technical studies cannot be carried out normally due to overtime.

    As for whether overtime can help complete the production plan, judging from the situation at the Fushun Longfeng Mine, the number of days workers take sick leave, converted into work hours, has greatly exceeded the work hours of overtime due to the serious damage to workers' health caused by overtime, not to mention the losses caused by various accidents. Some factories and mines have barely completed the production task figures by using overtime methods, but because they are rushing to complete the task and disregarding quality, a large number of defective products and rework are caused. For example, although the Tianjin Automobile Transportation Company "completed" the first quarter's car repair task by using a large amount of overtime, many of the repaired cars had to be repaired again. From April 15th to 20th, the rework time took up 344 hours of production time. Some factories and mines still cannot complete the task despite overtime because workers work too long and their efficiency is very low. For example, the Anshan Lingshan Agricultural Machinery Factory had a lot of overtime from January to July this year, but it still failed to complete the plan for five months. In addition, the large expenditure on overtime pay also greatly increases the cost of products. It can be seen that overtime does not help production, but instead causes varying degrees of damage to production.

    In order to ensure the completion of production tasks, it is necessary to start with improving the leadership of enterprises, actively strengthen planning management, improve labor organization, promote advanced experience, and carry out labor competitions. The Taiyuan Iron Factory is a good example. In the past, because the products of this factory were not fixed and production was unbalanced, the leaders resorted to overtime, which resulted in serious rework and scrapping, and the employees had many opinions. On February 20th, reader Ren Shuzhang criticized this phenomenon on the "Reader's Letters Page." According to Ren Shuzhang's letter in July, after the factory leaders accepted the criticism, they earnestly promoted the work plan, held regular processing and ordering meetings, and adjusted the labor organization of forging, machining, and metalworking. Therefore, although there has been no overtime since March, production has greatly increased. All enterprise leaders who regard overtime as a "trick" to complete production tasks should learn a lesson from this and correct their wrong practices.

### 加班加点不是完成生产任务的“窍门”

    加班加点不是完成生产任务的“窍门”
    读者陈文爵来信反映了抚顺龙凤矿加班加点的严重情况。这种现象，目前在厂矿企业中还不是个别的。例如，鞍山市灵山农业机械厂今年一月到七月加班加点的工时在五万小时以上；武汉市船舶修配厂五月份共加班一千多小时，其中钳工外勤组从八日到三十一日二十四天中有十六天加班加点，钳工曹启桥在二十一日到二十五日五天中连续加点二十一小时；锦州石油六厂工程队在八月二十日地下水道施工时，竟让工人们连续操作二十二小时。还有些厂矿，更采用了“义务劳动”和“借班”“调休”等变相加班加点的办法，来逃避国家对加班加点的限制。
    这种现象之所以出现，是因为有些企业领导人员把加班加点当作完成国家计划的“窍门”。他们认为为了生产而这样做是情有可原的；却看不到或者不关心大量加班加点对工人健康和安全的严重危害。像太原机车车辆修理厂机车车间管子组组长张起瑞和工人裴文彬都曾因为加班加点过多而累得病了十几天；山东省工业厅所属农具厂工人王文远因为连续加班而疲劳过度，工作时手指被机器轧断。还有一些厂矿中职工的业余文化学习和技术学习，也因为加班加点而不能正常进行。
    至于加班加点究竟能不能有助于完成生产计划呢？以抚顺龙凤矿的情况来看，由于加班加点严重地损坏了工人的健康，工人请病假的日数折成工时，已经大大超过了加班加点的工时，更不必说各种事故所造成的损失了。有些厂矿虽然用加班加点办法勉强完成了生产任务的数字，但是由于赶任务，不顾质量，造成大量废品和返工。如天津市汽车运输公司，虽然用大量加班加点的办法“完成”了第一季度的修车任务；可是，这些修出来的车，很多都要重修，四月十五日到二十日的六天中，返工时间就占去了生产时间三百四十四小时。有些厂矿虽然加班加点，但因为工人工作时间太长，效率很低，仍然不能完成任务。像鞍山灵山农业机械厂今年一月到七月大量加班，仍有五个月完不成计划。此外，加班费的大量支出，还使产品成本大大增加。由此可见，加班加点并不能有助于生产，反而会给生产带来程度不同的损害。
    为了保证完成生产任务，必须从改进企业的领导着手，积极加强计划管理，改善劳动组织，推广先进经验，开展劳动竞赛。太原铁工厂就是一个很好的例子。以前，这个工厂因为产品不固定，生产不均衡，领导人员就求助于加班加点的做法，造成的结果是返工报废严重，职工意见很多。二月二十日“读者来信专页”上读者任树章批评了这种现象。据任树章七月份来信反映，厂里的领导人员接受批评后，就认真推行作业计划，定期召开加工订货会议，并且调整了锻工、机工、金工的劳动组织；因此三月份以来虽然不再加班加点了，生产反而大大提高。所有把加班加点当作完成生产任务的“窍门”的企业领导人员都应该从这里得到教训，纠正自己的错误做法。
