    Aerial Survey of Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yumen to Border Section Completed
    The aerial survey of the 1,900-kilometer Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway line from Yumen to the Sino-Soviet border has been completed. Because the aerial survey replaced the ground reconnaissance survey and most of the preliminary survey, the survey and design work of the entire Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can be completed in advance, which will accelerate the construction speed of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. The use of aerial surveys also saves a lot of technical manpower and national investment, and can ensure that the selected route is economical and reasonable.
    The terrain along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Yumen westward to the border is very complex, passing through water-scarce Gobi deserts and desert areas, as well as the Tianshan Mountains. If ground surveying is used, there will be many difficulties in surveying technology and the living conditions of surveying personnel. Aerial surveys avoid these difficulties.
    This aerial survey was conducted under the guidance of Soviet experts, and the results were very good. In the future, aerial surveys will be widely used in newly built railways in areas with more complex terrain in our country. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 兰新路玉门到国境段航测完成

    兰新路玉门到国境段航测完成
    兰新铁路从玉门直到中苏国境一千九百多公里线路的航空测量已经完成。由于航测代替了在地面上进行的草测和大部分初测，兰新铁路全线的勘测设计工作可以提前完成，这样就加速了兰新铁路的修建速度。利用航空测量还节省了大量技术力量和国家投资，并且可以保证选出的线路经济合理。
    兰新铁路从玉门往西直到国境，沿线地形很复杂，要经过缺水的戈壁滩和沙漠地带，还要经过天山山脉。如果采用地面勘测，在勘测技术上和勘测人员生活上都有许多困难。航空测量就避免了这些困难。
    这次航空测量是在苏联专家指导下进行的，效果很好。以后我国在新建铁路上地形比较复杂的地段，将普遍采用航空测量。（新华社）
