Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House published 112 new Mongolian books of various kinds from January to the end of August, with a total of 432,200 copies. Among them, Mongolian textbooks are sufficient to supply the needs of Mongolian middle and primary school students and teachers in the entire Inner Mongolia region. This year, the main courses for Mongolian students in senior high schools are all taught in Mongolian, and extracurricular reading materials and teaching materials for fine arts and music in primary schools have also been translated into Mongolian for the first time this year. Among the literary works published this year are the Mongolian folk classical literary work "The Story of Gesar," which has been circulating for a thousand years, Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," and the People's Republic of Mongolia's "Ayush" (novel) and "Three Mountains" (opera). The Soviet novel "The Secrets of the Shooting Range" will be published soon.

In 1948, only four kinds of textbooks were published in Mongolian in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and only 43 kinds of literary and general reading materials. This year alone, 169 kinds of Mongolian textbooks and literary works will be published. (Xinhua News Agency)
