Implementing the "Three Fixes" Policy for Grain Down to the Household

    New Atmosphere Appears in Kangqiao and Other Townships in Hangzhou County
    Gu Zhenlin
    In late June, the Hangzhou County Party Committee organized three work teams to conduct pilot work on implementing the "Three Fixes" down to the household in Kangqiao, Ducheng, and Yiqiao townships.

    These three townships all have surplus grain. They have a total of 1,782 households. Last year, the state purchased and stored more than 2.8 million jin of grain net from these three townships, and sold 1.8 million jin. The state's net gain was a little over 1 million jin of grain. During the unified purchase, due to insufficient in-depth publicity of the unified purchase and sale policy for grain, and poor control of surplus and deficit grain households and grain retention standards, the food rations of some farmers were over-purchased. This year, during the unified sale, these townships once showed tension. In the spring, the "Three Fixes" were only implemented down to the township level. Surplus grain households still did not know how much they should sell to the state; deficit grain households also did not know how much grain the state would supply them. After implementing the "Three Fixes" down to the household this time, the masses' ideological doubts were dispelled. Yu Songgen from Ducheng Township said, "The 'Three Fixes' are actually 'Four Fixes.' They fix production, purchase, and sale, and also set our minds at ease. Chairman Mao knows what we are thinking." Xia Li, a surplus grain household, said, "In the past, surplus grain households were looked down upon, but after the 'Three Fixes,' they have become honorable." Xia Jinsong and Li Agen, deficit grain households, said, "Knowing how much grain the state will supply us in a year, we can produce with peace of mind." Many people also consciously reviewed their past mistakes of concealing production and arguing about supplies when discussing the "Three Fixes" policy. As a result of the "Three Fixes," the state's purchase amount was reduced by more than 1.1 million jin compared to last year, and at the same time, sales were reasonably compressed, reducing sales by more than 1.5 million jin compared to last year. The net result was that the state received more than 400,000 jin of grain than last year. This eliminated false phenomena in purchasing and sales.

    The masses have a clear understanding of the amount of grain they should be purchased, and production enthusiasm is generally high. They said: After the implementation of the "Three Fixes," there are "Two Changes and Three Exhaustions" in rural areas: "Barren fields must be turned into good fields, bad fields must be turned into better fields, manure pits must be cleaned out, river mud must be dredged up, and white fields must be planted." According to incomplete statistics, after the "Three Fixes" were implemented down to the household, the three townships expanded the planting of sweet potatoes by 34 mu, other miscellaneous grains by 115 mu, and late rice by 81 mu. The number of boats dredging river mud is increasing every day. The Yu Qingtian mutual aid team in the fifth electoral district of Ducheng Township dredged river mud after holding meetings until 11 o'clock at night. They said, "With the 'Three Fixes,' we don't even want to sleep." This electoral district originally had only one mutual aid team, but it has now increased to five. The enthusiasm of rural staff has also been greatly improved. The head of Kangqiao Township said, "After implementing the 'Three Fixes' down to the household, it is much easier to lead the masses in production."

    Through this pilot work, it can be seen that the grain "Three Fixes" policy fully meets the urgent needs of the broad masses of rural people, and its role in promoting various rural tasks is very significant. After the "Three Fixes" were implemented down to the household, some of the tense atmosphere in rural areas was greatly eased. Farmers have a clear understanding of purchasing and sales, eliminated ideological concerns such as "increased production leads to increased purchases" and "surplus grain is not honorable," production enthusiasm has increased, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has also been greatly improved. For example, in the third electoral district of Kangqiao Township, more than 30 households did not attend meetings in the past and ignored the staff. After the "Three Fixes" were implemented down to the household, they were very kind to the staff and no one was absent from the meetings. Precisely because the "Three Fixes" down to the household are the urgent demand of the masses, the masses actively assist the government in implementing the policy. For example, in a backward village in Yiqiao Township, the village cadres were not active enough in implementing the "Three Fixes" down to the household, so the masses themselves went to the township government to ask for help in carrying out the "Three Fixes." In the second electoral district of Ducheng Township, many farmers increased the planting of sweet potatoes and late rice the day after the "Three Fixes" policy was publicized.

    The "Three Fixes" down to the household is a broad mass work, and in-depth publicity of the policy to mobilize the masses is the key to doing this work well. The specific practices of these three townships can be divided into the following four steps: First, conduct policy education to unify ideological understanding. According to the specific situation of the township, the branch led the Party members to summarize the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, affirm achievements, examine shortcomings, and correct ideological understanding and work attitude through criticism and self-criticism, and study how to do a good job in implementing the "Three Fixes" down to the household. At the same time, train business personnel and prepare for assessment, calculation, and other tasks. Second, publicize the policy extensively through the township people's congress and various mass meetings, explain the policy, determine the average output, purchase tasks, and work plans for the whole township and each village, and register and verify the planting area, actual population, number of livestock, etc. of each household through mass discussion. Then, formulate a preliminary plan for the "Three Fixes." Third, mobilize the masses and democratically evaluate the draft of the "Three Fixes." Before the evaluation, it is necessary to repeatedly explain to the masses the basis for fixing production, purchase, and sale, how food rations, seeds, and feed are retained, and then focus on explaining that surplus grain can be freely disposed of. Generally, as long as the plan is roughly close to reality and the output of the staff themselves is correct, it will be supported by the majority of people. When the masses are truly mobilized, they can evaluate well, raising the output of those with low output and appropriately lowering the output of those with high output. The three main staff members in the fourth electoral district of Ducheng Township were all grain-deficient households last year. This year, according to their production situation, they were all evaluated as surplus grain households by the masses. The masses reflected that "the cadres are democratic, realistic, and we can handle it well." Fourth, summarize the "Three Fixes" work and mobilize the masses to carry out the movement to increase production and save grain. After the draft is announced, deeply understand the reactions of the masses, conduct a general inspection, correct deviations and shortcomings, and deal with outstanding issues. Hold separate meetings for surplus and deficit grain households, educate surplus grain households to work hard to produce and ensure the completion of tasks; educate deficit grain households to follow the principle of thrift, eat their own grain first, and then eat the state's grain. Announce the policy of unchanged production and purchase for three years and fixed unified sales for one year, and then organize and mobilize the masses to carry out the movement to increase production and save grain, striving to exceed the production plan targets.

    The "Three Fixes" down to the household is a meticulous and complex task, and it is very important to educate rural staff to correctly implement the policy. When the work in these three townships began, the township staff generally had a fear of difficulties; when the enthusiasm of the masses was high, they also produced a complacent and paralyzed thinking, always wanting to be lenient and set the output lower and retain more grain, not being realistic. For example, when Ducheng Township discussed output at the branch meeting, it lowered the output by ten jin per mu. In Kangqiao Township, individual staff members lowered the output themselves, causing dissatisfaction among the masses during the evaluation. There were also some phenomena in the evaluation where the output of some people was deliberately increased. The fear of trouble was universal, and after the movement was basically over, they were unwilling to go deeper into inspection, listen to the opinions of the masses, correct shortcomings, and deal with outstanding problems. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously conduct policy education for rural staff so that they can be patient, responsible, and realistic in solving problems.

### 杭县康桥等乡出现了新的气象

专栏：把粮食“三定”政策贯彻到户

    杭县康桥等乡出现了新的气象
    顾振麟
    六月下旬，杭县县委组织了三个工作组，分头在康桥、独城、义桥三个乡进行三定到户的试点工作。
    这三个乡都是有余粮的乡，共有一千七百八十二户，去年国家在这三个乡净征购入库粮二百八十多万斤，销售一百八十多万斤，国家净收进粮百万斤挂零。统购时由于对粮食统购统销政策宣传不够深入，对余缺粮户和留粮标准掌握不好，多购了部分农户的口粮，今年统销中这些乡曾一度呈现紧张。春天三定只贯彻到乡，余粮户还不知道自己应卖给国家多少；缺粮户也不知道国家供应他多少粮食。这次三定到户以后，群众的思想疑虑打消了。独城乡俞嵩根说：“三定就是四定，定产定购定销也定了心，毛主席知道我们的心思。”余粮户夏莉说：“过去余粮户受气，三定后变得光荣了。”缺粮户夏金松、李阿根说：“知道国家一年供应我们多少粮食，可以安心生产了。”不少群众在讨论三定政策时，还自觉检讨了自己过去瞒产量、吵供应的错误。三定结果，国家征购数比去年少一百一十多万斤，同时也合理压缩了销量，比去年少销一百五十多万斤，两项相抵，国家比去年多收进了四十多万斤粮。这样就去掉了购销中的虚假现象。
    群众对自己应该征购的粮食数目摸了底，生产情绪普遍高涨。他们说：三定办法实行后，农村中有“两变、三光”，“荒田要变良田、坏田要变好田，粪坑清光、河泥捻光、白田种光”。据不完全统计，三个乡在三定到户后，扩种甘薯三十四亩，其他杂粮一百一十五亩，晚稻八十一亩，捻河泥的船天天增加。独城乡五选区俞清田互助组，晚上开会到十一点钟后还去捻河泥，他们说：“有了三定，我们觉也不想睡了。”这个选区原只有一个互助组，现已增加到五个。乡村工作人员的积极性也大大地提高了，康桥乡长说：“三定到户后，领导群众生产好办多了。”
    通过这次试点工作，可以看出粮食三定政策是完全符合广大农村群众的迫切要求的，对农村各项工作的推动作用是很大的。三定到户后农村的某些紧张空气大大缓和了，农民摸到了购销的底，消除了“增产增购”、“余粮不光荣”等思想顾虑，生产积极性提高了，党同群众的关系也大大改善了。如康桥乡三选区原来有三十多户人家过去开会不到，见工作人员不理睬，三定到户后，见到工作人员很和气，开会一户也不缺席。正因为三定到户是群众的迫切要求，群众积极主动协助政府贯彻政策。如义桥乡有一个落后村，村干部对三定到户不够积极，群众自己就到乡政府去要求帮助他们搞三定。独城乡二选区，在三定政策宣传的第二天，不少农民增种甘薯晚稻。
    三定到户是个广泛的群众性的工作，深入宣传政策发动群众是做好这一工作的关键。这三个乡的具体做法约分如下四步：第一步：进行政策教育，统一思想认识。根据本乡的具体情况，支部领导党员总结粮食统购统销工作，肯定成绩，检查缺点，通过批评和自我批评，端正思想认识和工作态度，研究如何把三定到户工作搞好。与此同时训练好业务人员，做好评产、计算等各项准备工作。第二步：是通过乡人民代表大会和各种群众会议，广泛宣传政策，交代政策，确定全乡和各村的平均产量、征购任务和工作计划，通过群众讨论，登记核实各户的种植面积、实有人口、牲畜头数等。然后定出三定初步方案。第三步：发动群众、民主评议三定草案。在进行评议之前，必须在群众中反复说明定产定购定销的根据，口粮、种子、饲料是怎样留的，再着重讲明余粮可以自由处理。一般只要方案大体接近实际，工作人员本身产量正确，即会得到大多数人的拥护。群众真正发动了，他们就能很好评议，把产量低的提起来，高的适当地降低。独城乡四选区三个主要工作人员去年都是缺粮户，今年根据他的生产情况，都被群众评为余粮户，群众反映说：“干部民主了，实事求是，我们也就好办了。”第四步：总结三定工作，动员群众开展增产节约运动。在草案公布以后，深入了解群众的反映，普遍进行一次检查，纠正偏差和缺点，处理遗留问题。分别召开余、缺粮户会议，教育余粮户要努力生产，保证任务完成；教育缺粮户，根据节约原则，先吃自己的，后吃国家的。并宣布产购三年不变，统销一年一定的政策，接着组织动员群众开展增产节约运动，力争超过生产计划指标。
    三定到户是一件细致复杂的工作，教育乡村工作人员正确贯彻政策，是十分重要的。这三个乡工作开始时，乡的工作人员普遍有畏难情绪；在群众情绪高涨时，又产生太平麻痹思想，总想一宽再宽，把产量定低点，留量留宽些，不实事求是。如独城乡在支部会上讨论产量时每亩拉低了十斤，康桥乡有个别工作人员自己拉低产量，在评议时，造成群众不满，还有些在评产时有故意加高一部分人的产量的现象。怕麻烦情绪是普遍的，在运动基本结束后，就不愿再去深入检查，听取群众意见，改正缺点，处理遗留的问题。因此，必须不断对乡村工作人员进行政策教育，使他们能耐心负责实事求是，解决问题。
