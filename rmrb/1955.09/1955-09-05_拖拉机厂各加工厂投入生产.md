    Tractor Factory's Various Processing Plants Put into Production

    Several processing plants constructed for the industrialization of China's first tractor manufacturing plant, including a lumber processing plant, concrete mixing plant, aerated concrete plant, reinforced concrete component plant, metal structure plant, and sanitation equipment plant, have been completed and put into production. As these processing plants go into operation, the construction date for the tractor manufacturing plant's buildings is drawing nearer day by day. Currently, raw materials stockpiled in warehouses are being continuously sent to the processing plants; various roads for transporting prefabricated components from the processing plants to the construction site have also been completed.

    These processing plants will mass-produce various prefabricated components. The reinforced concrete component plant is currently producing and will produce hundreds of types of medium and small prefabricated components such as beams, columns, and roofing panels. The equipment in each processing plant consists of new machinery, and the production process employs an assembly line method. In prefabricating various reinforced concrete components, steel bars are sent to the steel bar workshop to be straightened, derusted, bent, welded, and tied using various machines. Then they are sent to the prefabrication workshop to be poured with concrete and vibrated, and then sent to the steam curing room for curing. Finally, the formwork is removed by the demolding workshop. These prefabricated components can be transported to the construction site at any time to be installed in the buildings.

    拖拉机厂各加工厂投入生产
    为中国第一个拖拉机制造厂进行工业化施工而建设的木材加工厂、混凝土搅拌厂、泡沫水泥厂、钢筋混凝土构件厂、金属结构厂和卫生设备厂等加工厂，已先后建成，并开始投入生产。随着这些加工厂的投入生产，拖拉机制造厂的厂房施工日期也一天天地临近了。现在，堆放在仓库里的原材料正源源不断地送进加工厂；从加工厂运送预制品到施工现场的各种道路也已修好。
    这些加工厂将大量生产各种预制品，钢筋混凝土构件厂正在生产和将要生产的梁、柱、屋面板等中型和小型预制品就有几百种。各个加工厂的设备都是新式的机械，生产过程采用了流水作业法。在预制各种钢筋混凝土构件时，钢筋送到钢筋车间用各种机器拉直、去锈、弯曲、焊接、绑扎后，就到预制车间灌注混凝土和进行震捣，再送往蒸汽养护室养护，最后由拆模车间把模板拆除。这些预制好的构件，随时可以运到施工现场安装到建筑物上去。
