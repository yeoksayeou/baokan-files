Must Seriously Handle Duan Mingyou's Errors
To the Editors:
	I want to expose the serious wrongdoings of Duan Mingyou, the Party Branch Secretary and Workshop Director of the Tenth Brine Well (Workshop) of the Jiuda Company, a joint state-private enterprise in Zigong City, Sichuan Province.
	Since Duan Mingyou was transferred to the Tenth Well in August 1954, his first priority has been to satisfy his own desires. There are very few offices and dormitories in the Tenth Well. Generally, at least four or five people share an office, but he had the dormitory where four workers lived vacated for him to use as a single office. In April of this year, in order to move his wife from the Sixth Well to live at the Tenth Well, he drove away several worker families, emptied two rooms, and demanded that the general affairs department renovate the rooms beautifully. He also demanded that the public buy him pots and bowls. Because this "project" was large, the financial staff pointed out that the "investment" might be difficult to reimburse, so he reprimanded the financial staff, saying, "Are you Party members or Youth League members? You can't even solve this little problem." When the deputy workshop director, Luo Xizhang, disagreed with his wrongdoings, he labeled Luo Xizhang as "sabotaging unity and undermining leadership authority." By June, the houses were renovated, which caused great dissatisfaction among the workers. In addition, Duan Mingyou also violated the grain policy, using workers' mess hall grain purchase certificates to buy forty jin of rice for his family in May.
	However, Duan Mingyou is indifferent to his work. He completely pushes the administrative leadership of the Tenth Well to others, and he doesn't care about anything. In the first half of June, the Tenth Well reduced production by more than 1,400 dan of salt. At that time, a comrade from the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department who was working down the well suggested that the production situation should be studied and ways should be found to avoid reducing production. Duan Mingyou actually replied, "What can we do about the reduction in production? We can only let it reduce."
	Duan Mingyou is very dismissive of Party work. He is usually busy sleeping and playing poker, and does not conduct political and ideological education for the workers. When accidents occur, he resorts to scolding and punishing people. For example, in December of last year, when driver Shen Shaorong had an accident, Duan Mingyou scolded him, saying, "If you don't work hard today, Chiang Kai-shek's eight million troops have been defeated, let alone you." As a result, Shen Shaorong was so frightened that he cried. This year during the Spring Festival, when workers applied for trade union subsidies, Comrade Wang Xiangxue said, "I won't apply. There are people who are more difficult. Let the trade union subsidize them!" Duan Mingyou knew about this and said that Wang Xiangxue was "inciting the workers" and asked him to reflect. Duan Mingyou also often publicly scolded technicians as "dead backwards, incorrigible after repeated teaching." Therefore, the workers generally circulated such a sentence: "Don't be afraid of heaven, don't be afraid of earth, just be afraid of the branch secretary calling for a talk." There was even a serious incident: in February of this year, wiping worker Liu Zhuhui had an accident, and Duan Mingyou actually brought Liu Zhuhui to "solitary confinement." After the company leaders discovered this, they severely criticized Duan Mingyou and pointed out that Liu Zhuhui should be released immediately. However, Duan Mingyou ignored it, still kept Liu Zhuhui confined for fourteen days, and deducted more than eighteen yuan from his salary.
	Duan Mingyou also acts like a tyrant in the Party, making decisions arbitrarily. He convenes or does not convene branch committee meetings as he pleases. At the meetings, regardless of whether his opinions are correct or not, problems must be decided according to his opinions. When others raise different opinions, he often throws tantrums and acts unreasonably. For example, in May, the waste products in the salt-making plant affiliated to the Tenth Well were serious. Weng Minghai, the Party member in charge of the salt-making plant work, requested to discuss this issue at the branch general meeting. The branch committee members also agreed, but Duan Mingyou reprimanded Weng Minghai, saying, "No discussion. Go back and do your job. You are fully responsible for the waste products." From November last year to June this year, Duan Mingyou only attended three group meetings in eight months, and no one dared to ask.
	Duan Mingyou also resists the criticism and supervision of the superior Party committee. Many of the comrades sent by the superior to the workshop to inspect the work were turned away by him. Many comrades in the company have reflected: "It is easy to discuss with any workshop, but it is difficult to do things in the Tenth Well." Even when Cui Mande, deputy secretary of the company's Party committee, went to the Tenth Well in April to inspect the work and pointed out that Duan Mingyou's attitude towards the workers was not good, Duan Mingyou said stubbornly, "Don't talk to me about these Marxism-Leninism! I am just like this, what can you do?"
	Because Duan Mingyou was acting recklessly, most of the workers in the Tenth Well were not at ease with their work, and their thoughts were very chaotic; even the deputy workshop director and branch committee members asked to be transferred to other units. The production situation of the Tenth Well is: since February of this year, it has never completed the plan, and production accidents have occurred continuously. In March, an accident caused a shutdown for more than a month, and in early July, there were four major and minor accidents.
	After Duan Mingyou's serious mistakes were exposed, the Municipal Party Committee and the Organization Department of the Company Party Committee sent people to investigate in June of this year. However, Duan Mingyou still resisted the investigation. Comrade Song Wenxiang of the Party Committee Organization Department went to the Tenth Well to find Chen Shaozhang, the organization member, to find out about the situation once. Afterwards, Duan Mingyou questioned Chen Shaozhang about what he had talked about, and warned Chen Shaozhang not to talk to the inspectors about the work of the branch in the future.
	Duan Mingyou's mistakes are extremely serious. Of course, this is the result of his own ideological production and the growth of serious bourgeois individualism. But the Jiuda Company Party Committee should also bear certain responsibilities. The Tenth Well is one of the key workshops of the Party Committee, but the responsible comrades of the Party Committee have always believed that Duan Mingyou "has a set of work methods" and "has strong principles," and the shortcomings are only "bad temper" and "rigid attitude." Therefore, his mistakes could not be stopped in time, and the problem became more and more serious.
	In order to uphold Party discipline and educate Duan Mingyou himself, the Jiuda Company Party Committee should seriously deal with the mistakes made by Duan Mingyou.

### 必须严肃处理段明友的错误

    必须严肃处理段明友的错误编辑同志：
    我要揭发四川省自贡市公私合营久大公司第十卤井（车间）支部书记兼车间主任段明友的严重错误行为。
    段明友在一九五四年八月调到十井来以后，首先就追求满足自己的享受。十井的办公室、宿舍很少，一般的一间办公室至少坐四、五个人，而他却让把住着四个职工的一间宿舍腾空，给他做单人办公室。今年四月份，他为了把爱人从六井搬到十井来住，就赶走了几户工人，腾空两间房子，并要总务部门把房子修整得漂漂亮亮的，还要公家给他买锅买碗。因为这项“工程”很大，财务人员提出
  “投资”怕不好报销，他就训斥财务人员说：“你们是党团员吗？这点事情都不能解决。”车间副主任罗锡章不同意他这种错误做法，他就给罗锡章戴上个“破坏团结，破坏领导威信”的帽子。到六月份，房子修好了，在职工中却引起了很大的不满。另外，段明友还违犯粮食政策，在五月份曾借职工伙食团购粮证为家里买了四十斤米。
    段明友对于工作却是漠不关心的。他把十井的行政领导工作完全推给别人，自己啥事也不管。六月上半月十井减产一千四百多担盐，当时下井工作的市委组织部同志提出应该研究生产情况，想办法不减产。段明友竟回答说：“减产有什么办法呢？只有让它减。”
    段明友是十分轻视党的工作的，平时忙于睡大觉、打扑克，不向工人进行政治思想教育；等到发生了事故就采用训斥、惩办的办法。如去年十二月份开车工人申绍荣发生了一次事故，段明友就训他说：“今天你还不好好干，蒋介石八百万军队都打垮了，何况你一个人。”结果把申绍荣吓得直哭。今年春节职工申请工会补助时，王相雪同志说：“我不申请，还有更困难的人，工会补助他们吧！”段明友知道后却说王相雪“煽动工人”，要他反省。段明友还经常公开骂技术人员“死落后，屡教不改”。因此在职工中普遍流传着这样一句话：“天不怕，地不怕，只怕支部书记喊谈话。”还曾发生过这样一件严重的事件：今年二月份拭篾工人刘祝辉发生了一次事故，段明友竟把刘祝辉弄来“关禁闭”。公司领导上发觉以后对段明友提出了严重批评，指出应立即将刘祝辉释放。可是段明友置之不理，还是将刘祝辉关了十四天，并扣了他十八元多的工资。
    段明友在党内也是称王称霸，独断专行。支委会他说开就开，他说不开就不开。在会上，不管他的意见正确不正确，都得按他的意见决定问题。当别人提出不同意见时，他常常大发雷霆，耍蛮横态度。如五月份十井附属的制盐处废品严重，负责制盐处工作的党员翁明海在支部大会上提出要求讨论这个问题，支委们也都同意，可是段明友却训斥翁明海说：“不讨论，你回去干，出废品你负完全责任。”从去年十一月到今年六月的八个月中，段明友只参加了三次小组会，别人也不敢过问。
    段明友对上级党委的批评监督也采取抗拒态度。上级派到这个车间检查工作的同志，有不少都被他挡驾而归。公司里很多同志都反映：“哪个车间都好商量，只有十井难办事。”甚至当公司党委副书记崔满德在四月份到十井检查工作，指出段明友对职工态度不好时，段明友还蛮横地说：“你不要跟我说这些马列主义！我就是这个样子，又有啥办法呢？”
    由于段明友这样胡作非为，十井绝大部分职工不安心工作，思想很混乱；甚至连车间副主任、支部委员们也要求调到其他单位去。十井的生产情况是：从今年二月份以来一直没有完成过计划，生产上事故不断发生，三月份一次事故就停产一个多月，七月上旬就发生大、小事故四次。
    段明友的严重错误被揭发后，今年六月市委和公司党委组织部派专人进行调查。但是段明友对检查仍然采取抗拒态度。党委组织部宋文祥同志到十井找组织委员陈绍章了解了一次情况，事后段明友就追问陈绍章谈了些什么，还警告陈绍章以后不准向检查的人谈支部工作情况。
    段明友的错误是极端严重的。当然这是他自己思想上产生和滋长着严重的资产阶级个人主义的结果。但是久大公司党委会也应该负一定的责任。十井是党委重点车间之一，党委负责同志却一直认为段明友“工作上有一套”“原则性强”，而缺点只是“脾气不好”“态度生硬”。因此，就不能及时制止他的错误，而使问题越来越严重。
    为了严肃党纪和教育段明友本人，久大公司党委会应该严肃地处理段明友所犯的错误。
