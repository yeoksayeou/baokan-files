    Changsha Meat Joint Processing Plant Begins Operations
    The construction project of the Changsha Meat Joint Processing Plant has officially started. This plant mainly processes frozen meat and other by-products. The processing will be done mechanically, and the cleanliness and hygiene equipment in each workshop is very comprehensive.
    The construction project of this plant was designed by Chinese engineering and technical personnel and has been studied by Soviet experts. The machinery and equipment of the factory are also manufactured by China itself.
    The plant is expected to go into production by the end of this year. After the plant is completed, Hunan Province will process 1,000 hogs into 50 tons of frozen meat daily at this plant, which will supply domestic people and export.
    In this way, Hunan's hogs do not have to be transported to other places for processing, and frozen meat exports can be used to replace hog exports, which will greatly reduce mortality and other losses during hog transportation. Some of the by-products of this factory will be made into fertilizer for use by the vast number of farmers in Hunan.

    长沙肉类联合加工厂开工
    长沙肉类联合加工厂建筑工程已经正式开工。这个厂主要是加工冻肉及其他副产品。加工过程都将用机械操作，各车间的清洁卫生设备很周全。
    这个厂的建设工程是由我国工程技术人员设计的，曾经经过苏联专家的研究。工厂的机器设备，也是由我国自己制造的。
    这个厂预计在今年年底投入生产。这个厂建成以后，湖南省每天将有一千头毛猪在这个厂加工成五十吨冻肉，供应国内人民食用和出口。
    这样，湖南的毛猪就不必运到外地加工，也可以用出口冻肉代替毛猪出口，毛猪运输途中死亡等损耗将会大大减少。这个厂的一部分副产品，将被制成肥料，供湖南广大农民使用。
