    Impressions of a Visit to Japan
    Xie Bingxin
    In August of this year, I participated in the Chinese delegation to attend the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan and to express our condolences to the victims of the atomic bombs in Japan. During my eighteen days in Japan, I met many old Japanese friends and came into contact with more Japanese people. After exchanging greetings, they always asked me to talk about my impressions of this visit to Japan. For Japan, a place I revisited after many years, I really have too many feelings!
    I deeply feel the pain of the current living conditions of the Japanese people. After the end of the war, under the occupation of the American army, Japan lost its independence, its territory became an American military base, and the basic human rights of its people were trampled upon. As Comrade Shiga Yoshio, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said: "Under such circumstances, as long as they recall the situation in China before liberation, Chinese comrades and friends will be able to fully understand the suffering of the Japanese people."
    However, I also deeply feel that more and more people in Japan have clearly and resolutely chosen their own path—the path of peace and independence. They demand a change in the semi-occupied state, they oppose the conspiracy to turn Japan into a foreign military base and drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder in future wars of aggression, and they oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and rearmament. They urgently demand the restoration of normal relations with all countries in the world, especially their close neighbors—China and the Soviet Union. They urgently demand the lifting of the "embargo," they want to use their sophisticated industrial products to carry out mutually beneficial trade with all countries in the world, especially with their neighbor—China, which has a population of 600 million, to improve their country's economic situation. They want to consolidate their alliance with the forces of peace in the world and strive to build a new Japan that is independent, peaceful, and democratic.
    Speaking of the current life of the Japanese people, you don't need to read lengthy news magazines; just in our casual conversations, or in a hurried journey, in a word or two, a small matter or two, we can fully understand the pain of the Japanese people!
    The airports we passed through, such as Haneda, Fukuoka, Itami, and Iwakuni, are also American air force bases. In the waiting rooms, American soldiers come and go, and American soldiers are busy operating on the airport. I paid special attention to the fact that outside Itami Airport, the streets on both sides were still lined with bars, dance halls, and shops with English signs, exclusively for the American military, and there were also several pawnshops! At the same time, not far from here, there are also large, small, horizontal, and vertical slogans such as "Oppose the expansion of the US Air Force base" and "Yankees go home."
    A Japanese friend told me: "Do you know? At a time when we cannot produce enough food for ourselves, our farmers' fields are being reduced piece by piece. You wouldn't believe it, but more than 800 US military bases are scattered across Japanese territory. Did you see the reports in the newspaper these past two days about the struggle of the people of Sunagawa-cho in Tokyo against the expansion of the Tachikawa US Air Force base? The people will not yield; it is a matter of life and death for them!"
    At a dinner party, only a few close friends were present. When talking about my own daily life, a Japanese classmate of mine suddenly asked: "Do you pay taxes?" She confused me. She said with a wry smile, "How lucky you are, you hardly know what taxes are! Here, everything is taxed, and taxes are suffocating us..."
    After dinner, we thanked the host, who handed each of us an envelope. When we opened it, we found that it was a symposium hosted by "Women's Pictorial," and someone had taken notes of our conversations to be published. The 10,000 yen in the envelope was a reward for me. The receipt stated—if I remember correctly—11,760 yen, and the 1,760 yen was paid for "tax."
    In the car, looking at the scenery on both sides, a Japanese friend who was entertaining us asked: "Do you think the clothing of our Japanese women is more exquisite than before?" I smiled and nodded yes. She gave a pale smile and said: "This is not because living conditions have improved, it is related to the problem of 'prostitution'!" When I looked at her in surprise, she said: "I am not exaggerating at all. The poverty of the countryside and the collapse of industry and commerce have forced hundreds of thousands of Japanese women to embark on the path of 'prostitution'. It is said that in Tokyo alone, there are hundreds of thousands of prostitutes. This is a very serious social problem!"
    A Japanese nanny who used to help in my Tokyo home came to see me at the hotel at eleven o'clock at night. She asked very kindly about the studies of my children. She also sighed and said: "Your burden is not light either, it costs a lot of money to go to university and high school." I said with a smile: "I'm happy to tell you that I have never been so relaxed in my life! My children are studying at universities and high schools, and I only pay for their monthly meal expenses. The state still subsidizes those college students from poorer families who cannot afford the meal expenses..." She was silent for a while and said: "My eldest child should go to high school. The tuition fees for private schools are too expensive. When he went to register, the school simply advised him not to take the exam; but public schools also cost a lot of money. He cried to me and said: 'Mom, I'm sorry for you! Since Dad died, you have worked so hard for us for so many years, and now you have to work harder day and night to support my studies. I think I won't study, but my future employment will be a problem.' Our life..." She couldn't go on. I stroked her shoulder and didn't know what to say. After a while, she silently wiped away her tears, put on the peace dove pin I gave her, left a photo of her and her two children, and bowed deeply to me to say goodbye. I sent her out, watching her thin back disappear into the deep darkness....
    These sad little stories are endless. Let us talk about the broad masses of the Japanese people, who have awakened and strived from painful experiences and are advancing with confidence!
    On the way back to the hotel from the University of Tokyo, the Japanese youth who accompanied me asked with a smile: "Mr. Xie, do you think our young people have changed? Have they made progress?" I said: "I haven't seen anything else yet, but there were many more female students asking questions in the meeting today than before. Weren't they vying to raise their hands?" He laughed and said: "That's right! Let me tell you, in the Japanese peace movement, young people and women are two strong new forces. Without them, this movement would not be so widespread and in-depth. We used to often fall into depression and pessimism, and the female students were also shy and timid. Now we are not like that! We know that we are not fighting alone, we are a small team in the large team of peacekeepers in the world. 'Unity is strength', you often sing that song, don't you?" The afterglow of the setting sun shone on his face, and I will never forget that extraordinarily lovely smile full of strength! For decades, I have continuously seen this smile in China, and it is not the first time I have seen it in Japan!
    In the basement cafeteria, we waited to go upstairs for the meeting. Several young people surrounded us. A male student pointed to a female student and said: "She is embarrassed to say it to you herself, she is a very good singer. We are promoting a song movement, we go to the countryside, to factories, to schools, we sing with everyone. Some are existing songs, and some are newly composed by us. We sing out our pain, joy, and hope together... I hope you have the opportunity to listen to our singing."
    I heard this "singing" at the Tokyo conference of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs! It was a large chorus of more than a thousand people. They sang "Youth March," "Song of a Happy Life," and other songs. These songs are majestic and lively, very different from the "lingering" tunes I used to hear in Japan. The broad masses of the Japanese people have been invigorated!
    At Hiroshima Station, we were saying goodbye to the people who came to see us off, when suddenly the waves of people parted on both sides, and three or four young girls squeezed forward and held our hands tightly. These atomic bomb victims, who were sick and injured and always shy about "showing their faces" in public, were sitting across from us that morning, still sobbing with their heads lowered. Now they have actually rushed to this "sea of people," which greatly moved me!
    The train started, and they finally let go of our hands from outside the train window, waving handkerchiefs stained with tears, while shouting: "We will definitely remember, we will live bravely, and we will always persist in the struggle for peace!"
    We will definitely remember, and will always remember the Japanese people who are struggling for independence, peace, and democracy in difficult circumstances.
    The power of the people is invincible, and the Japanese people who are fighting for peace and independence will surely win!

    访日观感
    谢冰心
    今年八月里，我参加了中国代表团，到日本去出席禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，并慰问日本的原子弹受害者。在日本逗留的十八天之中，我会见了许多旧识的日本朋友，接触了更多的日本人民。寒暄以后，他们总是要我说说我这次访日的观感。对于旧地重游的日本，我真是感想太多了！
    我深深地感觉到今天日本人民生活处境的痛苦。战争结束以后，日本在美国军队的占领下，丧失了独立，国土成了美国的军事基地，国民的基本人权也遭了蹂躏。正如日本共产党中央委员志贺义雄同志所说的：“在这样情况下，只要回忆到解放前的中国的情况，中国的同志和朋友是能够完全理解日本国民的痛苦的。”
    可是，我也深深地感觉到，在日本有着愈来愈多的人，已明确地、坚决地选定了自己的道路——和平和独立的道路。他们要求改变半被占领的状态，他们反对把日本变为外国的军事基地并驱使日本人民充当未来侵略战争炮灰的阴谋，他们反对复活日本军国主义和重整军备。他们迫切要求和世界各国恢复正常的关系，特别是他们的紧邻——中国和苏联。他们迫切要求解除“禁运”，他们要利用他们精巧的工业出品，和世界各国尤其是和他们的邻邦——拥有六万万人口的中国进行互利的贸易，来改善他们国家的经济状况。他们要和世界上的和平力量巩固地结合起来，为建立独立、和平、民主的新日本而努力。
    谈到现在日本人民的生活，不必看长篇大论的新闻杂志，就是我们在闲叙家常，或是匆促的行旅中，一两句话，一两件小事，我们就能够完全了解日本国民的痛苦！
    我们所经过的机场，如羽田、福冈、伊丹、岩国等机场，同时也都是美国空军基地。候机室里，都有美国军人出出进进，机场上有美国兵士在忙碌地操作。我特别注意到在伊丹机场外，汽车走出多远，街上两旁还是挂着英文招牌的专为美军开设的酒馆、舞厅、商店，还有几家当铺！同时，离此不远，也就有“反对扩大美空军基地”和“美国佬滚回去”的大、小、横、直的标语。
    一位日本朋友告诉我说：“你知道不？在我们粮食不能自给的时候，我们农民的田地，却一块一块地被削小下去。说起你都不会相信，八百多处美军基地布满了日本国土，你看见这两天报纸上报道的东京砂川町人民反对扩大立川美空军基地的斗争吧？人民不会屈服的，那是他们的生死关头呵！”
    在一个晚餐会上，只是几个很熟的朋友在座谈。谈到我自己日常生活的时候，我的一位日本同学忽然问我说：“你纳税不？”她把我问糊涂了。她苦笑着说：“你多么幸运，你几乎不懂得纳税是怎么回事！在我们这里，什么都有税，税把我们压得喘不过气来……”
    吃过饭，我们谢过主人，主人却递给我们每人一个信封。回来打开一看，原来刚才是“妇人画报”主持的座谈会，我们的谈话都有人笔记下来，准备发表的。这信封里的一万元日币，是送给我的酬谢。单据上写的——假如我记得不错的话——是一万一千七百六十元，那一千七百六十元就付了“税”。
    在汽车上，向两旁眺望的时候，一位招待我们的日本朋友问我说：“你觉得我们日本妇女的服装比从前讲究了不？”我笑着点头说是。她惨淡地笑了一笑，说：“这不是因为生活改善了，这是与‘卖春’问题有关呀！”当我惊讶地注视她的时候，她说：“我一点都没有夸大，农村的穷困，工商业的倒闭，逼得成千上万的日本妇女，走上‘卖春’的道路。据说仅是东京一个城市，就有几十万个娼妓，这是多严重的一个社会问题！”
    一位曾在我东京家里帮忙的日本保姆，在夜里十一点到旅馆来看我。她极其亲切地问起我的孩子们学习的情况，她还叹一口气说：“您的负担也不轻吧，大学和高等学校里要花许多钱呵。”我笑着说：“告诉你也高兴高兴，我一辈子也没有这么轻松过！我的孩子们在大学和高中学习，我只替她们交每月的饭费。那些家庭贫苦一些，交不起饭费的大学生，国家还是要补助的……”她沉默了一会，说：“我的那个大孩子该上高等学校了，私立学校的学费太贵了，他去报名的时候，学校方面根本就劝他不必来考；可是公立学校也得花许多钱。他对我哭，他说：‘妈妈，我对不起你！自从父亲死了，你就为我们辛苦了这许多年，如今为我读书，你又得黑夜白日加倍地操作。我想我不读书吧，我将来的就业又成问题。’我们的生活……”她说不下去了。我抚着她的肩膀，也不知道说什么好。过了一会，她默默地擦了眼泪，带起我送她的一只和平鸽的别针，留下了一张她和两个孩子的相片，对我深深地鞠躬道别。我送她出去，望着她瘦小的背影，消失在深沉的黑夜之中……。
    这种使人难过的小故事，是写不完的。让我们谈谈广大的日本人民，从苦痛的经验里，觉悟奋发，充满着信心前进的精神吧！
    从东京大学回旅馆的车上，那位陪我的日本青年，满面笑容地问我说：“谢先生，您觉得我们青年人改变了不？进步了不？”我说：“别的还没有看出来，不过今天会场里女同学发问的比从前多多了，她们不是争着举手么？”他笑了，说：“正是这样！告诉您，在日本的和平运动里，青年和妇女，是两支强大的生力军。没有他们，这运动是不会这样广泛而深入的。从前我们常常陷于苦闷、悲观，女同学们也是羞怯、胆小。现在我们不那样了！我们知道我们不是孤军奋斗，我们是世界上保卫和平的大队伍中的一小队。‘团结就是力量’，你们常常唱那一支歌，是不是？”晚霞照在他脸上，我永远忘不了那异常可爱的、充满了力量的笑容！这笑容，几十年来，我在中国不断地看到，就是在日本，也不是第一次看见！
    在地下室的食堂里，我们等着上楼开会。几位青年把我们包围了起来。一位男学生指着一位女学生说：“她不好意思自己对您说，她是一个很好的歌手。我们正在提倡一种歌声运动，我们到农村，到工厂，到学校里去，我们和大家在一起唱歌。有的是原有的歌曲，有的是我们新编的，我们把自己的痛苦、快乐和希望，一齐高唱了出来……希望您有机会听我们的歌唱。”
    我在禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的东京大会上，听到了这“歌声”了！那是一千多人的大合唱。他们唱的是“青年进行曲”、“幸福生活之歌”，和其他别的歌曲。这些歌曲雄壮、活泼，和我从前在日本常听见的“缠绵悱恻”的调子，大不相同。日本广大人民振奋起来了！
    在广岛车站上，我们正向送行的人们纷纷道别，忽然人群的波浪两边分开，三、四个年轻的姑娘，挤上前来，紧紧地拉住我们的手。这些带病负伤，一向羞在人前“抛头露面”的原子弹受害者，当天早晨，坐在我们对面，还在低头啜泣，如今居然赶到这“人海”中来，使我大受感动！
    火车开动了，她们才从车窗外放松了我们的手，向我们挥动沾满了热泪的手巾，一面喊着说：“我们一定会记住的，我们要勇敢地活下去，要永远为和平而坚持斗争下去的呀！”
    我们也一定会记住，而且会永远记住在艰苦的环境里为独立、和平和民主而斗争的日本人民。
    人民的力量是无敌的，为和平和独立而斗争的日本人民是一定会胜利的！
