How We Lead the Transformation of Private Commerce
Cai Dongyuan, Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Lao Zha District Committee

    Lao Zha District is one of the most concentrated commercial areas in Shanghai. Within an area of less than one square kilometer, there are more than 5,000 private shops, accounting for 84 percent of the total number of industrial and commercial households in the district. The number of employees in private shops totals more than 38,000. In 1954, the pure commercial turnover accounted for about 13 percent of the city's total. These shops are distributed in 134 industries, with extremely varying sizes. Large households employ more than 1,000 people, while many small households are family-run shops. In terms of business nature, not only are there many retailers, but also many wholesalers and especially vendors. In the past, speculation by private merchants here could often cause fluctuations in market prices throughout the city. In the process of socialist transformation, many problems have also been exposed here. For example, many industries have sluggish business and are experiencing difficulties, and industry difficulties have led to ideological confusion between labor and capital, and labor-capital relations are not normal enough, etc. Thus, the work of transforming private commerce has become the district committee's regular central task.

    In order to implement the Party's policy of transforming private commerce in light of the characteristics of the district, we have conducted investigations and studies on issues such as the degree of difficulty in various industries and the ideological situation of labor and capital. We used existing data from the district tax bureau, statistics section, and other departments to grasp the basic situation of private commerce (including the number of people, households, and capital), and regularly understand the material of sales, profits, and expenses of various industries, from which we learned the maintenance level, the degree of difficulty, and the existing level of improved business management of various industries. Then, according to the business performance and capital of each industry and household, we ranked and classified them to determine which industries could be maintained, which had slight difficulties, and which had serious difficulties. Then, we took different measures according to different situations. For example, there are 26 rice shops in the district, and the distribution is still in line with current needs. In order to maintain them, it is necessary to appropriately increase the sales agent tasks to solve their difficulties; and there are too many small department stores, which cannot be fully maintained. Therefore, in addition to focusing on arrangements, we took various measures such as counseling to change careers, relocation, and mergers according to different conditions. For units that really could not be maintained, we agreed to partially lay off or close down to basically maintain the industry. In the process of conducting investigations and studies, we discovered problems in a timely manner and tried to solve them in a timely manner. For example, last year we checked the sales agent volume, profits, and expenses of the rice industry, and found that the arranged sales agent volume of some stores was not completely commensurate with the maintenance level, resulting in long-term losses for these rice shops. At the same time, it was also found that the arrangement of sales agent volume was not combined with promoting internal transformation of enterprises, so that the management costs of some rice shops with higher management costs have not been reasonably saved for a long time, while individual stores have a lot of surplus. All of these indicate that the work of certain departments in the district has been blind. When inspecting the thinking of labor and capital, we found that some capitalists were operating negatively, which also affected the ideological emotions of some employees; and we also found that in the rice industry, political education was not closely connected with economic arrangements, and the transformation of enterprises was not well combined with the transformation of people; when we first did these tasks, due to lack of experience, we also had some shortcomings of taking over the work of administrative departments. However, all these problems have been initially resolved due to timely discovery and timely handling. It can be seen that investigation and research is an important prerequisite for improving work and implementing the Party's policies.

    Secondly, we strengthened the political and ideological education of shop employee masses. Shop employees are laborers in private shops. They are not only familiar with the business and understand the situation in the store, but they are also an important force in supervising capitalists to improve business management and fighting against the illegal activities of capitalists; they are also the main force on which we rely to implement the Party's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private commerce.

    In order to do a good job in their political and ideological education, we conducted key education experiments. For example, in April last year, the proportion of state-owned commerce increased significantly, and some private merchants in the district were already experiencing difficulties, and some employees were also resentful under the influence of capitalists. At this time, we first selected the employees of the small department store industry, which had more significant industry difficulties, a large number of households, and representatives, to carry out education work. We separately held symposiums attended by older workers, young workers, trade union workers, and employees of severely difficult units, encouraging them to talk about the causes of the difficulties of enterprises and the attitude that employees should take, and conduct education based on their exposed thoughts, seeking solutions. Our specific approach was to first talk to them about the growth of production in Shanghai in recent years and the gradual improvement of the lives of the working people, and then talk about the overall growth of production in the country, so that they had a preliminary correct understanding of the market economy, cleared up negative emotions, and expanded their horizons. Then, we helped them analyze the reasons for the difficulties of private enterprises, so that they realized that private commerce has intermediate exploitation, coupled with the long-term poor management style and low credibility, which are the main reasons why customers do not come to the door. And state-owned enterprises and cooperatives are the people's enterprises. They have no intermediate exploitation, and the goods are cheap and good, so customers are of course willing to go to state-owned stores to buy. After reversing the wrong thinking, we further carried out the education of socialism and capitalism, so that they realized that only the development of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce can realize socialism. The responsibility of employees is to strengthen the supervision of private commerce and help the government carry out socialist transformation of private enterprises with the attitude of masters of the country. Such education improved the class consciousness of employees, so that they could consciously implement the government's policies. We summarized the experience of educating department store employees this time, and promoted these experiences to other industries, which also improved the class consciousness of employees in other industries.

    Again, unifying the thinking of staff members in the district-level departments and making the departments cooperate organically in work has a major effect on leading the transformation of private commerce.

    We focused on three lines to carry out ideological leadership. The first line is the staff of the trade and financial sectors. In the district the trade system has wholesale stations or work groups for various specialized companies. These institutions are under the leadership of municipal specialized companies in business and the district committee in politics. We have strengthened political and ideological leadership for them, so we have achieved better play of the leading role of the state-owned economy in the distribution of goods; on the other hand, we have also strengthened ideological leadership for banks, in order to do a good job in credit work according to the amount of private merchants' capital in the distribution of goods. The second line is the district-level government departments, namely the tax bureau, the industry and commerce section, and the labor section. Strengthening political and ideological leadership for these departments, and providing correct education in administrative management and tax policies. This will ensure the implementation of the Party's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private commerce. The third line is mass organizations such as trade unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Women's Federation, etc. Through these departments, strengthen the education of employees, capitalists and their families to ensure the implementation of various policies. The above three lines are closely linked and echo each other. Relaxing any line will affect the work. Therefore, we also often educate Party members and non-Party staff in various departments to strengthen the overall concept, achieve organic links between departments in work, and overcome conservative thinking and departmentalism.

    For capitalists, we adopted a method of combining struggle with education. After all the rice industry households in the district were changed to sales agents last year, the capitalist mode of operation and management style were restricted, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the capitalists. This February was the slackest month of business throughout the year, and some rice stores had some losses, so the capitalists took the opportunity to clamor, and took the opportunity to delay paying wages, withdraw funds, create difficulties, and sell livelihood goods, spreading a tense atmosphere. In response to this situation, we held a staff meeting with the participation of capitalists. At the meeting, the trade union made a summary report on the rice industry sales agent situation, using the facts to indicate that the average profit of commodities after the sales agent was slightly increased, and most stores had small losses, and the main reason for the losses was that the enterprise management system and the nature of the enterprise were not adapted to the changes. The so-called "tension" was artificial, and it was definitely not the result of socialist transformation. At the same time, the illegal acts of illegal capitalists were exposed in a positive way, and they were reported. Such meetings not only cracked down on the arrogance of capitalists, but also improved the class consciousness of employees. At the same time, we led the Federation of Industry and Commerce to conduct patriotic and law-abiding education for capitalists, and played the role of backbones in the business community, so that they could lead capitalists to conduct self-examination and mutual examination, and criticize the capitalists' decadent and reactionary thoughts and behaviors. Those who were bad were given administrative sanctions to achieve the purpose of educating the general. In addition, we also educated the families of capitalists through the Women's Federation, and took care of some well-behaved and law-abiding stores that still had difficulties, so that they could gradually make a small profit, in order to better obey the leadership of the state-owned economy.

    In general, under the correct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, we have done a lot of work in commerce in recent years. However, due to insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of the work of transforming private commerce, and insufficient grasp of the objective situation, there are still many shortcomings in the work. For example, taking over the work of administrative departments, being accustomed to "one-stop" leadership, the close connection between political education and economic arrangement work in the implementation process is not enough, the collection of materials in the investigation and research work is not detailed and systematic enough, etc., all of which directly or indirectly affect the depth of the work. In the future, we must improve these shortcomings, and strengthen policy research in our work, explore new experiences, in order to better implement the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private commerce.

    我们怎样领导私营商业的改造工作
    中共上海市老闸区委员会书记　蔡东园
  老闸区是上海最集中的商业区之一。在不足一个平方公里的地区中，有私营商店五千多户，占全区工商户总数百分之八十四。私营商店的从业人员共有三万八千多人。一九五四年的纯商业营业额占全市比重百分之十三左右。这些商店分布在一百三十四个行业中，大小极为悬殊，大户从业人员多至千余人；小户不少是夫妻店。就经营的性质来说，不仅零售商多，批发商也不少，摊贩则尤多。过去这里私商的投机活动常常可能引起全市市场物价的波动。在进行社会主义改造中，这里所暴露的问题也多。例如，不少行业生意清淡，发生了困难，因行业困难又产生了劳资思想混乱，劳资关系不够正常等等问题。这样，改造私营商业工作就成为区委会经常性的中心工作。
    为了根据区内的特点来贯彻党改造私营商业的政策，我们就各行业困难的程度、劳资的思想情况等方面问题进行了调查研究工作。我们利用区税局、统计科等部门的现成资料来掌握私营商业的基本情况（包括人数、户数、资金等），并定期了解各行业的进销货、利润、费用的材料，从所得到的材料中了解各行业的维持水平，困难的程度，以及改善经营管理的现有水平，由此再根据各行业各户营业好坏、资本多寡，进行排队分类，确定那些行业可以维持，那些稍有困难，那些严重困难，然后根据不同情况采取不同的措施。如全区有米店二十六户，分布尚符合目前需要，为了使他们维持下来，就必须适当地增加代销任务，解决他们的困难；而小百货店过多，无法全面维持，因此除了有重点地安排外，就根据不同条件，采取辅导转业、迁区、合并等各项措施；对实在无法维持的单位，同意其部分解雇或歇业，使行业基本上维持下来。在进行调查研究时，我们及时发现了问题就及时设法解决。如去年我们检查了米业代销量、利润、费用等方面的情况，发现部分商店安排代销量同维持水平尚不完全相称，以致这些米店长期有些亏损。同时，又发现安排代销量没有同促使企业内部改造相结合，使某些经营管理费用较高的米店长期没有得到合理的节约，而个别商店又有很多的盈余。这些都说明区内某些部门的工作存在着盲目性。检查劳资双方思想时，我们发现部分资方经营消极，也影响到部分职工的思想情绪；更发现在米业中政治教育同经济安排衔接不够，对企业的改造同对人的改造也没有很好结合起来；我们在开初做这些工作时，由于缺乏经验，也有些包办代替行政部门工作的缺点。但所有这些问题，由于及时发现及时进行处理，现在都获得了初步的解决。由此可见，调查研究工作是改进工作贯彻党的政策的重要前提。
    其次，我们加强了对店员群众的政治思想教育。店员是私营商店中的劳动者，他们不但熟悉业务并且了解店内的情况，他们是监督资本家改善经营管理并同资本家的不法行为进行斗争的重要力量；也是贯彻党对私营商业利用、限制、改造政策的主要依靠的力量。
    为了做好对他们的政治思想教育工作，我们进行重点教育试验。例如，去年四月份，国营商业比重有了显著增长，区内部分私商已呈现困难，部分职工受资本家影响，也有埋怨情绪。这时，我们先选择了行业困难较显著、户数多并有代表性的小百货行业的店员进行教育工作。我们分别召开了由老年工人、青年工人、工会工作人员和困难严重单位职工参加的座谈会，启发他们漫谈企业困难的原因和店员应该采取的态度，根据他们暴露的思想进行教育，求得解决。我们的具体做法是先对他们谈上海几年来生产增长的情况和劳动人民生活逐步提高的情况，然后谈到全国总的生产增长的情况，使他们对市场经济情况有了初步的正确的认识，清除了消极情绪，扩大了眼界。接着就帮助他们分析私营企业困难的原因，使他们认识到私营商业有中间剥削，加上长时期来经营作风恶劣，信誉低落，是顾客不上门的主要原因。而国营企业、合作社则是人民的企业，他们没有中间剥削，货物价廉物美，顾客当然愿意到国营商店去购买。在扭转错误思想后，我们就进一步进行社会主义和资本主义两条道路的教育，使他们认识到只有国营企业、合作社的发展，并对私营工商业进行社会主义改造后，才能实现社会主义。店员的责任就是要加强对私营商业的监督，以国家主人翁的态度帮助政府对私营企业进行社会主义改造。这样的教育提高了店员的阶级觉悟，因而使他们能自觉地去贯彻政府的政策。我们总结了这次教育百货业店员的经验，把这些经验推广到其他行业中去，也提高了其他行业职工的阶级觉悟。
    再次，统一区级有关部门工作人员的思想，使各部门有机地配合起来进行工作，这对领导私营商业改造工作有重大的作用。
    我们抓住三条线进行思想领导。第一条线是贸易金融部门的工作人员。贸易系统在区内有各专业公司批发站或工作组，这些机构业务上受市专业公司领导，政治上受区委领导，我们对他们加强了政治思想领导，就做到了从货源分配上更好地发挥国营经济的领导作用；另一方面，我们又加强对银行的思想领导，以便在货源分配时，根据私商资金多寡，做好信贷工作。第二条线是区级政权部门，即税局、工商科、劳动科等。加强对这些部门的政治思想领导，并给予行政管理、税收政策方面正确的教育。这就能保证党对私营商业利用、限制、改造政策的贯彻。第三条线则是工会和工商联、妇联等群众团体。通过这些部门，加强对职工、资本家及其家属的教育，来保证各项政策的实施。上述三条线是密切联系，相互呼应，放松任何一线都会使工作受到影响。因此，我们又经常教育各部门党员和非党工作人员，加强整体观念，在工作中取得各部门的有机联系，克服保守思想和本位主义。
    对资本家，我们则采取了斗争同教育相结合的方法。去年全区米业户改为代销店后，由于资本主义的经营方式和经营作风受到了限制，引起了资本家的不满。今年二月份是全年营业最淡的月份，某些米店有了些亏损，资本家就乘机叫嚣，并借此拖延发薪，抽逃资金，制造困难，并出售生财杂物，散布紧张空气。针对这种情况，我们召开了有资本家参加的职工大会，会上由工会作米业代销情况的总结报告，用事实指明代销后商品平均利润是微升的，多数店户亏损不大，而亏损主要原因是企业经营管理制度和企业性质的改变不相适应，所谓“紧张”，是人为的，决不是社会主义改造的结果。同时，正面揭发了不法资本家的违法行为，并进行了检举。这样的会议不但打击了资本家的气焰，并且提高了职工的阶级觉悟。与此同时，我们有领导地通过工商联对资本家进行爱国守法教育，发挥工商界骨干的作用，使他们带动资本家进行自我检查，相互检查，批判资本家腐朽的反动的思想和行为。对其中恶劣分子则给予行政处分，达到教育一般的目的。另外，我们又通过妇联，对资本家的家属进行教育，并对一些安分守法尚有困难的店户加以照顾，使他们逐步做到有微利可图，以便更好地服从国营经济的领导。
    总的来讲，在上海市委的正确领导下，几年来我们在商业工作上做了不少工作。但由于对私营商业改造工作的艰巨性复杂性认识不足，对客观情况的掌握不够，工作上还有不少缺点。如包办行政部门工作，习惯于“一揽子”的领导，工作贯彻过程中政治教育和经济安排工作的密切衔接还不够，在调查研究工作中材料收集尚不够细致、系统等等，都直接或间接地影响到工作的深入。今后我们必须改进这些缺点，并在工作中加强政策钻研，摸索新的经验，才能更好地贯彻党对私营商业利用、限制、改造的政策。
