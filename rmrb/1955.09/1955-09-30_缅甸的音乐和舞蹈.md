Burmese Music and Dance

	The jade conch is blown, the hair buns tower,
	The bronze drum is struck, the tattoos leap,
	Pearl tassels whirl, stars shimmer,
	Floral garlands compete, dragons and snakes stir.

These are a few lines from the Tang Dynasty's great poet Bai Juyi's "Piao Music – Presented in the Seventeenth Year of Zhenyuan." Piao was the ancient name for Burma. In the seventeenth year of Zhenyuan in the Tang Dynasty (around 801 AD), Burma sent a diplomatic mission to visit China, arriving in the capital, Chang'an. Emperor Dezong of Tang hosted a banquet and enjoyed Burmese music and dance. Thirty-five musicians played twelve famous pieces, and dancers in gorgeous costumes sang and danced. The Burmese delegation also presented twenty-two kinds of musical instruments, such as the pipa, drum, zither, wind instruments, flute... According to the Biography of Piao in the New Book of Tang: "Its sounds are eight: metal, shell, silk, bamboo, gourd, leather, tooth, horn." Bai Juyi's poem describes the wonderful performances given by the Burmese delegation during their visit to China at that time.

Cultural exchange between China and Burma did not begin in the Zhenyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, but much earlier. China and Burma share nearly 1,600 kilometers of contiguous border. The mountains and rivers of Burma and the mountains and rivers of southwestern China are of the same system, so the relations between the two countries are even closer. As early as the second century BC, Chinese people followed the routes of the Lijiang River, the Chindwin River, and the Nujiang River to reach Burma. At that time, Burma became an important route for China to reach India and Afghanistan.

In the first century AD, the King of Burma sent a diplomatic mission to visit China, presenting national music and illusionists. According to Burmese archaeologist Du Shengkao, Buddhism was introduced into Burma from China in the fourth century AD, and many Buddhist terms in Burma were transmitted through China. Today, Burmese Buddhist temples still have pagoda-style multi-layered eaves that are similar to Chinese architecture. I visited the old Burmese capital of Mandalay this spring. Although the royal city was destroyed in World War II, from the model and ruins, one can still see that this exquisite and magnificent royal city architecture has similarities with the Forbidden City in Beijing. After the seventh century AD, the Tantric Buddhism of Nanzhao, which was transmitted from India to China, came through Burma.

From the above extremely simple narrative, we can know that very early on, Burmese culture and art had reached a very high level. In terms of music and dance, it was also very outstanding.

Burmese music was originally introduced from India, including the harp, pipa, six-stringed zither, wind instruments, flute, etc., and developed in the Burmese direction to become Burmese music. The number of musical instruments that exist today is of course less than in the past. Some of the twenty-two types mentioned above have been lost. However, the stringed and wind instruments that have been passed down, such as the harp, curved harp, zither… are very beautiful and pleasant to play. The more significant innovations in Burmese orchestral instruments are the drum set, followed by the zither and the Burmese harp - *saung gauk*.

The early dance forms of Burma are somewhat different from the present ones. Today's dances are further developed on the basis of the past. However, the spirit of ancient dances still exists today. Some of it can still be seen in the "greeting," such as dancers dancing gracefully to the music, the content of which is greatly related to Buddhism. Early dance was influenced by the Hindu culture, and we can see its similarity to the art forms of South India.

After the decline of the Pagan Dynasty, music and dance with Buddhism as the theme developed more widely. A song passed down from the Pagan era—a war song—is sung by a singer dancing with a shield. Music and dance became popular everywhere. When the king went on tour, or when a street meeting was held, or when the king granted an audience, or at the king's celebration, or at pagoda festivals, almsgiving, and victory, music and dance had to be played at the beginning and end of these important occasions. In the eighteenth century AD, Burmese composers and playwrights translated *Yama Yauk* and *Ramayana*, which were introduced via Siam. Later, "Ayutthaya (Siam) songs" were absorbed into Burmese music. When we were in Mandalay, we still heard the influence of this music.

Burmese music and dance were greatly influenced by the court, and its rise and fall were greatly related to the king's preferences. But at the same time, there were also folk music and dance. Folk music and dance reflected the people's religious and working lives. First is the ritual of worshipping spirits. Most of the offerings are based on famous dances accompanied by music telling biographies, with spirit songs, spirit music, and spirit dances. On the days of Buddhist festivals, when extremely happy, waist drums and double-sided waist drums are struck. Burma is an agricultural country. After farming, the vast number of farmers also want to enjoy cultural and entertainment life, so they perform the long drum dance and sing songs about agricultural labor. This is the best folk dance in Burma, loved not only by the vast number of rural people, but also by the city people. On all joyful occasions, such as weddings, pagoda festivals, and monastic ordinations, this dance is performed. There is no village without long drum dancers. From this point, one can see how popular this dance is in Burma.

From Burmese drama, we can also find another form of music, which is opera music. A variety of instruments suitable for any sound performance are arranged on the stage. If a scene of sailing appears on the stage, the melody and rhythm of the music will show the waves of the ocean and the movements of the sailors. There are certain tunes to express various sounds and movements, such as war music, laments, sleep tunes, flight tunes, king tunes, general tunes, and sangha tunes.

In short, Burma is a country that loves music and dance, and the development of music and dance has reached a considerable level. Since Britain implemented colonialism in Burma, Burmese culture and art have been invaded and destroyed, and its development has been greatly affected. Because the Burmese people love their own music and dance, and because the Burmese people stubbornly maintain their national culture and art, these music and dances that are loved and heard by the people are still popular among the broad masses.

Since the establishment of the Union of Burma, the government and people have actively strived to revive their own music and dance. For example, in the field of classical music, eighty-one classical songs have been handed over to famous artists in Upper Burma and Lower Burma for sorting out, and the songs, interludes, string sounds, rhythms, etc. have been uniformly incorporated into regular formats. The songs that meet the standards have been added with melodies, and musical scores have been added to forty of the songs, which will be printed and circulated. Burmese artists are studying how to accept the legacy of their own national music and dance and accept the essence of excellent foreign music and dance to enrich and create their own music and dance.

The Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation to China gave us a wonderful performance in Beijing, including classical music and dance, folk music and dance, as well as newly created modern music and dance, reflecting the Burmese people's pursuit of a happy life and the Burmese people's ardent desire to oppose war and demand peace.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the prime ministers of the two countries exchanged visits and issued a joint statement of the Five Principles, marking a new page in the relationship between China and Burma. On this basis, the traditional friendship and cultural exchanges between our two countries have undergone unprecedented development. This spring, the Chinese Cultural Delegation visited Burma, and now the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation is visiting China at our invitation. This is a major event in the cultural exchange between China and Burma. Cultural exchange can promote mutual understanding and enhance friendship between the two countries. We wish the Burmese Cultural Delegation a great success in their visit and performances, and we hope that the cultural exchange between China and Burma will develop day by day, and that the friendship between China and Burma will increase day by day.

### 缅甸的音乐和舞蹈

    缅甸的音乐和舞蹈
    周而复
    玉螺一吹推髻耸，
    铜鼓一击文身踊，
    珠缨炫转星宿摇，
    花鬘斗薮龙蛇动。
    这是唐朝大诗人白居易所写的：“骠国乐——贞元十七年来献之”里的几句。骠国就是现在的缅甸。唐贞元十七年（约公元八○一年）的时候，缅甸派外交使节访问中国，到达当时的都城长安，唐德宗设宴招待和欣赏缅甸的音乐和舞蹈，有乐工三十五人演奏十二支名曲，有舞蹈家穿着华丽的服装载歌载舞。缅甸代表并献赠各式各样的乐器二十二种，如琵琶、鼓、琴、管、笛……据新唐书骠国传记载：“其音八：金、贝、丝、竹、匏、革、牙、角。”白居易这首诗就是描绘当时缅甸代表团访问中国时演出的精彩节目。
    中国和缅甸文化交流不是始于唐贞元间，而是比这更早。中缅两国国境相连将近一千六百公里，缅甸的山脉河流和我国西南的山脉河流是同出一系，因此中缅两国的往来关系更加密切。早在公元前二世纪以后，中国人就循着丽江、钦德文江和怒江而去缅甸，当时缅甸成为中国去印度和阿富汗的要道。
    公元一世纪缅甸国王曾派外交使节访问中国，同时献国乐及幻人。据缅甸考古学家杜生诰称：公元四世纪佛教已由中国传入缅甸，而缅甸的佛学名词有很多是经过中国传到缅甸的。现在缅甸的佛教寺庙中还有和中国建筑相似的宝塔式的多层屋檐楼阁。我今年春天访问缅甸故都曼德勒，皇城虽然在第二次世界大战中被毁，但是从模型中从废墟上还可以看到这座精致壮丽的皇城建筑和北京故宫有共同之点。公元七世纪后，自印度传到中国的南诏密宗是经过缅甸而来的。
    仅仅从上面极其简单的叙述里，我们可以知道在很早很早以前，缅甸的文化艺术就已经达到很高的水平。就音乐和舞蹈来讲，也是很出色的。
    缅甸音乐最初自印度传入，有竖琴、琵琶、六弦琴、管笛等等，按照缅甸的方向发展成为缅甸自己的音乐。现在所存的乐器当然比过去为少，上面所提到的二十二种，有些已经失传了。但是流传下来的管弦乐器，如竖琴，弯琴，箧琴，……演奏起来是非常优美悦耳的。缅甸管弦乐器中的比较显著革新的是套鼓，其次是箧琴和缅甸琴——箜?。
    缅甸初期的舞蹈形式和现在的有些不同，现在的舞蹈是在过去的基础上更加发展了。但古代舞蹈的精神有的还流传到现在，从“迎”里头还可以看到一些，如舞蹈演员随着音乐清歌曼舞，内容跟佛教有很大关系。舞蹈早期受忻都文化影响，我们可以看出它和南印度的艺术形式有相似之处。
    蒲甘王朝衰微以后，以佛教为主题的音乐和舞蹈发展得更普遍了。一首从蒲甘时代流传下来的歌曲——一首战歌，歌唱者就用一面盾舞着唱着。音乐和舞蹈在各地普遍流行。在王巡幸的时候，或当举行街前会议，或王赐予召见，或王的庆祝大典，或佛塔节日、施舍和战胜等等重大事件，音乐和舞蹈必须在这些重要场合开始时和结束时演奏。到了公元十八世纪，缅甸的作曲家和剧作家翻译了耶马剧和拉马耶那等，这些是经暹罗传入的。以后，“育陀耶（暹罗）歌曲”被吸收到缅甸音乐中。我们在曼德勒的时候，仍然听到这种音乐的影响。
    缅甸的音乐和舞蹈受宫庭的影响很大，它的兴衰也和王的喜爱有很大关系。但同时也有民间的音乐和舞蹈。民间的音乐舞蹈反映了人民的宗教和劳动生活。首先是祭神，祭神供献的大半是用著名的舞蹈配以音乐叙述传记为主题，有神曲、神乐和神舞。在佛节的日子极度愉快的时候，便敲击腰鼓和双面腰鼓。缅甸是农业国家，广大农民耕种之余，也要享受文化娱乐的生活，就表演长腰鼓舞，唱起有关农作劳动方面的歌曲。这是缅甸民间最好的舞蹈，不但为广大农村人民所喜爱，也为城市人民所喜爱，在一切愉快的场合，如婚庆、佛塔节、出家节都跳这种舞蹈，跳舞者随着长音细腰鼓的音节而舞蹈。没有一个乡村没有长腰鼓的舞蹈者，从这一点就可以知道这种舞蹈在缅甸流行得如何普遍了。
    从缅甸的戏剧中我们还可以找到另外一种音乐形式，就是戏曲音乐，在舞台上布置一种适合任何音响表演的各种乐器。如果舞台上出现一幕航海的场面，音乐的调子和节拍就表演海洋的浪涛和水手的动作。表现各种音响和动作的有其一定的调子，如战乐、悲歌、睡眠调、飞翔调、君王调、将相调和僧伽调等等。
    总之，缅甸是一个爱好音乐和舞蹈的国家，并且音乐和舞蹈的发展有了相当高度的水平。自从英国在缅甸实行殖民主义统治以后，缅甸的文化艺术遭受到侵略和摧残，它的发展受到很大的影响。由于缅甸人民爱好自己的音乐和舞蹈，由于缅甸人民顽强地保持自己民族的文化艺术，这些为人民所喜见乐闻的音乐和舞蹈还流行于广大人民中间。
    缅甸联邦建立以后，政府和人民积极努力复兴自己的音乐和舞蹈，如古典音乐方面已将八十一个古典歌曲交给上缅甸和下缅甸的著名艺术家整理，将歌曲、插曲、弦音、节奏等统一纳入正规格式，合标准的歌子都已加上曲调，其中四十个歌子已加上乐谱，要付印流传。缅甸艺术家在研究如何接受自己民族的音乐舞蹈方面的遗产和接受外国优秀音乐舞蹈的精华来丰富和创造自己的音乐和舞蹈。
    缅甸联邦访问中国文化代表团在北京为我们作了精采的演出，其中有古典的音乐和舞蹈，有民间的音乐和舞蹈，也有新创作的现代音乐和舞蹈，反映了缅甸人民对幸福生活的追求，反映了缅甸人民反对战争要求和平的热烈愿望。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，两国总理互相访问并且发表了五项原则的联合声明，标志着中缅两国的关系展开了新的一页。在这基础上，我们两国之间的传统友谊和文化交流有了空前的发展，今年春天中国文化代表团访问了缅甸，现在缅甸联邦文化代表团应邀访问中国，这是中缅两国文化交流上的重大事件。文化交流可以促进彼此的了解，增进两国的友谊。祝缅甸文化代表团访问演出获得巨大的成功，愿中国和缅甸的文化交流日益发展，愿中国和缅甸的友谊日益增进。（附图片）
