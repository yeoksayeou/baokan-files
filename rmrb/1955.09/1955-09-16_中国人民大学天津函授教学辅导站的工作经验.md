The Work Experience of the Tianjin Correspondence Teaching and Tutoring Station of Renmin University of China

In order to improve the professional knowledge and political theory level of on-the-job cadres in finance departments, enterprises, factories, and mines to meet the needs of national economic construction, Renmin University of China has established a correspondence teaching and tutoring station in Tianjin.

The Tianjin Correspondence Teaching and Tutoring Station of Renmin University of China opened in February 1953. At that time, there were ten specialized classes: national economic planning, industrial economics, industrial statistics, industrial accounting, trade statistics, foreign trade, domestic trade, supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives, banking, and finance. It absorbed on-the-job cadres with certain qualifications to study. The study period was two years. If all exams were passed upon completion, the school would issue a graduation certificate, which had the same effect as a graduation certificate from the specialized training courses of Renmin University of China.

The first and second cohorts of correspondence students, totaling 780 people, had already graduated in 1954 (the actual number of graduates was 688). In January 1955, another 390 new students were enrolled in the third cohort. The original ten specialized classes were reduced to four: industrial economics, trade economics, industrial accounting, and industrial statistics (because other specialized classes did not have enough potential students in Tianjin).

Judging from the academic performance of the graduates, everyone's level of Marxist-Leninist theory has significantly improved, the past tendency of emphasizing business and neglecting theory has been changed, and it has been understood that it is impossible to master business well without studying theory.

Regarding learning from Soviet experience and connecting it with reality, correspondence students had a one-sided understanding at the beginning of their studies. They demanded to learn how to solve specific problems in their work, which was of course correct; but their understanding of how to learn from advanced Soviet experience was insufficient. They did not understand that only by studying Soviet experience well could they better connect it with reality, nor did they understand that the school's teaching plan was not formulated to train personnel for a certain department, so connecting with reality could not be aimed at a certain enterprise or a specific department. The correspondence teaching and tutoring station often explained the purpose of the teaching plan to the students, explaining the correct understanding that should be had of learning from Soviet experience and connecting it with reality, and gradually changed the students' one-sided understanding of connecting with reality.

After studying, the correspondence students improved their professional knowledge and improved their work. For example, one student, based on what he learned from studying Soviet industrial accounting, wrote a "daily accounting method for voucher sorting lists in contracted engineering enterprises." After a trial run, it has begun to be promoted and the response has been good. Some people, based on what they learned from studying Soviet foreign trade organization and technology, put forward rationalization proposals to improve the organizational structure of their units, which were sponsored and encouraged by their superiors. Some school teachers, after participating in correspondence learning, improved their teaching quality and compiled some teaching materials, solving some difficulties in teaching. Some people, after studying the Soviet industrial accounting major, improved their ability to analyze statements. In the past, it took four hours to analyze a statement, but now it only takes more than half an hour. Some accounting section chiefs, after studying industrial accounting, taught it within their sections, enriching the content of professional learning in the section and improving the professional level of all personnel. Correspondence students in finance departments, after completing their finance major, had theoretical weapons in mastering budgets and reviewing budgets, improving work efficiency and quality.

In running correspondence education, the Tianjin Correspondence Teaching and Tutoring Station of Renmin University of China has explored some experience.

According to the experience of the Tianjin Correspondence Teaching and Tutoring Station of Renmin University of China, we currently have the conditions to run correspondence education well. The vast number of on-the-job cadres in factories, mines, enterprises, departments, party and government organs, and mass organizations across the country have a strong desire to learn; but their work cannot be separated from them, and their level of theoretical and scientific knowledge is not sufficient to meet the needs of national construction. Therefore, vigorously running correspondence departments, night universities, and other forms of spare-time education are welcomed and eagerly enrolled in by them. Although on-the-job cadres are working hard every day, as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and gives them certain assistance, they can learn well. The experience of the Tianjin Correspondence Teaching and Tutoring Station of Renmin University proves that correspondence education is indeed an important method for training and improving on-the-job cadres, and it can be carried out as a formal education of the state. The claim by some people that we cannot currently run correspondence education or that we cannot run it well, and that correspondence education cannot become a formal education of the state, is obviously unfounded.

When recruiting students, it is necessary to correctly stipulate the admission conditions and resolutely implement them. This is one of the important conditions to ensure the learning quality of correspondence students. The so-called correct admission conditions mean that one must be politically clear and people with political problems must not be allowed to participate in the entrance examination; secondly, one must have a junior high school or high school education level. If this point is not well taken care of, it will bring great difficulties to correspondence teaching; in addition, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of consistent learning and application, and combining theory with practice. Those who do what work should be allowed to study what subject, otherwise the correspondence students will complain that learning cannot be combined with practice and cannot help improve their work, thus reducing their learning enthusiasm or even suspending or dropping out of school.

When running correspondence education, it is necessary to strive to solve the problem of supplying teaching materials to correspondence students. Correspondence education is a new education undertaking, and we lacked teaching materials in this area in the past. It is not easy to write a set of teaching materials suitable for correspondence students to read, which is a very heavy task. However, correspondence students mainly rely on self-study, and to ensure their learning, we must pay special attention to the compilation of various teaching materials, and we must organize a certain force to undertake this work, which must be supplied in a timely manner, be easy to understand, and especially the content of the teaching materials must be related to reality.

It is necessary to take various measures to ensure the study time of correspondence students. The work of on-the-job cadres is very busy. If the leadership does not pay attention to solving the problem of their study time, it will not be easy for correspondence students to persist in learning. Over the past two years, the Tianjin Correspondence Teaching and Tutoring Station of Renmin University of China has attached special importance to this point. They have taken the method of consultation with various organs to solve the problem of students' study time. Some organs, according to the requirements of the station, have ensured that correspondence students have more than fifteen hours of study time per week, reduced the concurrent posts of correspondence students in the organs, and enabled correspondence students to have two weeks of vacation time each year during the examination period. However, some units have not noticed or cannot adhere to this practice, which has caused great difficulties for those participating in correspondence learning, and some have even dropped out midway as a result.

For correspondence students, it is also necessary to conduct a certain number of teaching hours. The view that there is no need to conduct teaching since it is correspondence is inappropriate. Because at present, the educational level of our correspondence students is still low, their self-study ability is relatively poor, and in addition, there is a shortage of teaching materials, so it is still necessary to conduct a certain number of teaching hours for correspondence students, and as many lectures as possible should be given under possible conditions. However, due to the characteristics of correspondence education and various limitations, teaching can only be carried out with emphasis and in a concise manner. In this way, tutoring work has a particularly important meaning. For students' difficult problems in learning, important parts of correspondence teaching materials, etc., tutoring should be carried out as timely as possible. Experience has proved that teaching and tutoring have a very important guiding and promoting role in correspondence students' self-study. At the same time, teaching and tutoring must also pay attention to appropriate coordination. Generally speaking, when there are more lectures, tutoring can be reduced, and if the number of lectures is reduced, tutoring should be strengthened.

In the process of conducting correspondence teaching, it is necessary to establish and adhere to the homework system. Generally speaking, business course homework can be assigned eight times per semester (an average of twice per month), and theory courses should be less. This can cultivate and improve the self-study ability of correspondence students, promote correspondence students to continuously review the courses; and through the inspection of homework, we can also understand the teaching quality of teachers and the learning quality of students, and then improve the teaching content. Therefore, making the greatest effort to establish and adhere to the homework system is something that must be paid attention to from the beginning of correspondence education.

In terms of organizational leadership, the correspondence teaching and tutoring station should often supervise and inspect the self-study of correspondence students, establish some systems for exchanging learning opinions with correspondence students, and periodically ask correspondence students to submit reports on their learning situation. The supervisors of the correspondence station should also actively and systematically go deep into the correspondence student study groups to carry out work, and should assist the organs where the correspondence students are located to conduct ideological education in a timely manner in light of the various performances of the correspondence students in their studies, and encourage everyone to study hard. As for the work of the correspondence teaching and tutoring station, in addition to general administrative work, the most important thing should be teaching tutoring work, so the staff of the correspondence teaching and tutoring station must be properly equipped, and attention must be paid to the cultivation and improvement of professional knowledge, otherwise, if the staff of the correspondence station do not understand business, it is not only a personal distress, but also directly affects the learning effect of correspondence students.

Finally, running correspondence education and establishing correspondence teaching and tutoring stations must also obtain the leadership and support of the local party committee, and various organs must have sufficient understanding of the significance of cultivating and improving on-the-job cadres in the form of correspondence. When recruiting students for the third cohort, the Tianjin Correspondence Teaching and Tutoring Station of Renmin University of China first discussed the admission conditions with the relevant departments of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, studied in detail the problems that might be encountered and the solutions, and allocated enrollment quotas to various organs through the municipal party committee. Therefore, among the students recruited for the third cohort, party members and Communist Youth League members accounted for 54.9% of all students, and from the perspective of positions, cadres at the section chief level accounted for 49.8%. This not only ensured the political quality of the correspondence students, but also ensured the cultural and theoretical level of the correspondence students, enabling the correspondence teaching and tutoring station to solve many difficult problems.

    中国人民大学天津函授教学辅导站的工作经验
    马建民
    为了提高财经部门、企业、厂矿在职干部的专业知识和政治理论水平，以适应国家经济建设的需要，中国人民大学在天津设立了函授教学辅导站。
    中国人民大学天津函授教学辅导站是一九五三年二月开学的。当时设有国民经济计划、工业经济、工业统计、工业会计、贸易统计、对外贸易、国内贸易、供销和消费合作社、银行、财政等十个专业班。吸收具有一定条件的在职干部学习。学习时间为两年，结业时如考试全部及格，由学校发给毕业证书，这种证书和中国人民大学专修科毕业证书具有同等作用。
    第一、二届函授生，已经有七百八十人在一九五四年结业（实际毕业人数是六百八十八人）。一九五五年一月又招考了第三届新生三百九十人。并将原来的十个专业班缩减为工业经济、贸易经济、工业会计、工业统计等四个专业班（因其他专业班在天津没有足够的开班对象）。
    从结业生的学习成绩看，大家的马克思列宁主义理论水平有了显著提高，过去重业务轻理论的倾向有所改变，了解到不学习理论就不可能很好地掌握业务。
    对于学习苏联经验和联系实际，函授生开始入学时，有着片面的了解，他们要求学习能解决工作中的具体问题，这当然是对的；但对如何学习苏联的先进经验则认识不足，不了解只有好好学习苏联经验才能更好地联系实际，也不了解学校的教学计划并不是为培养某一部门的人材制定的，因而联系实际不可能是针对某一企业或某一具体部门的。函授教学辅导站针对这种情况经常向学员说明教学计划的目的性，说明对学习苏联经验和联系实际应有的正确认识，逐步改变了学员们对联系实际的片面认识。
    经过学习，函授生提高了专业知识，改进了工作。如有一个学员，根据学习苏联工业会计核算的心得，写出了“包工企业中凭证整理单日记账办法”，经试行后，已开始推行，反应还好。有的人根据学习苏联对外贸易组织和技术的心得，提出了改进本单位组织机构的合理化建议，得到了上级的赞助和鼓励。有的学校教师参加函授学习后，提高了自己的教学质量，并编了一些教材，解决了教学中的一些困难。有的人在学习了苏联工业会计专业后，在分析报表方面有了提高，过去分析一个表要四小时，现在只要半小时多就完成了。有的会计科长在学习工业会计后，就在本科内进行传授，充实了本科的业务学习内容，提高了全科人员的业务水平。财政部门的函授生在学完了财政专业后，在掌握预算和审核预算方面有了理论武器，提高了工作效率和工作质量。
    在举办函授教育中，中国人民大学天津函授教学辅导站已经摸索到了一些经验。
    根据中国人民大学天津函授教学辅导站的经验，我们目前是有条件办好函授教育的。全国各厂矿企业部门、党政机关、群众团体的广大在职干部，有着强烈的学习要求；但工作离不开他们，而他们的理论知识和科学知识水平又不足以适应国家建设的需要。因而大力举办函授部、夜大学等业余教育，他们是非常欢迎而乐于入学的。在职干部虽然天天在紧张地工作着，但只要领导重视，给他们一定的帮助，他们是可以学好的。人民大学天津函授教学辅导站的经验证明，函授教育确实是一项培养和提高在职干部的重要方法，而且是可以作为国家的一种正规教育来进行的。有些人认为目前我们不能办函授教育或者办也办不好以及函授教育不能成为国家正规教育的说法，显然是没有根据的。
    在招考学生时，必须正确地规定招生条件，并坚决贯彻。这是保证函授生学习质量的重要条件之一。所谓正确的招生条件，就是必须政治上清楚，决不允许政治上有问题的人参加投考；其次必须有初中或高中的文化水平，这点如不能很好注意，那就会给函授教学带来很大困难；另外，就是必须坚持学用一致、理论同实际相结合的原则，做什么工作的就让他学习什么学科，否则函授生就会抱怨学习不能结合实际，不能帮助改进工作，因而降低学习情绪甚至休学退学。
    在举办函授教育时，必须努力解决函授生的教材供应问题。函授教育是一项新的教育事业，我们过去缺少这方面的教材，要想编写一套适合于函授生阅读的教材不是容易的，这是十分繁重的工作。但函授生以自学为主，为保证他们的学习，就必须特别重视各种教材的编写，必须组织一定的力量来担任这项工作，既要供应及时，又要通俗易懂，特别是教材内容必须联系实际。
    必须采取各种措施，保证函授生的学习时间。在职干部的工作是很忙的，如果在领导方面不注意解决他们的学习时间问题，就不容易使函授生坚持学习。两年来中国人民大学天津函授教学辅导站特别重视了这点。他们采取同各机关协商的办法来解决学生的学习时间问题。有些机关按该站要求，保证了函授生每周有十五小时以上的学习时间，减少了函授生在机关内的兼职，并使函授生每年考试期间可有两周的休假时间。但也有些单位没有注意到或不能坚持这种做法，使参加函授学习的人遇到很大困难，甚至有的因此中途退学。
    对于函授生，还必须进行一定时数的讲授。有人认为既是函授就不必进行讲授的看法是不妥当的。因为目前我们的函授生的文化水平还低，自学能力还比较差，加以教材缺少，所以对函授生进行一定时数的讲授还是必要的，在可能条件下能多讲授就多讲授些。但由于函授教育的特点和种种条件的限制，在讲授时也只能有重点地提纲挈领地讲。这样，辅导工作就有着特别重要的意义。对于学生在学习中的疑难问题，函授教材中的重要部分等等，均应尽量及时进行辅导。经验证明：讲授和辅导对于函授生的自学，有着极重要的指导和推动作用。同时，讲授和辅导，还必须注意适当配合。一般说，在讲授多的时候，辅导可以减少，如果讲授时数减少，辅导则应加强。
    在进行函授教学过程中，必须建立和坚持作业制度。一般说来，业务课作业可以每学期八次（平均每月两次），理论课应少一些，这可以培养和提高函授生的自学能力，推动函授生不断地对课程进行复习；并且通过对作业的检查，还可以了解教员的授课和学生的学习质量，进而改进教学内容。因此，用最大的努力来建立和坚持作业制度，是函授教育一开始就须要注意的。
    在组织领导方面，函授教学辅导站，应经常对函授生自学进行督促检查，建立一些同函授生交换学习意见的制度，定期让函授生送交学习情况汇报。函授站的视导员更应主动地有计划地深入到函授生学习小组中去进行工作，并应协助函授生所在机关，针对函授生在学习上的各种表现，及时进行思想教育，鼓励大家好好学习。至于函授教学辅导站的工作，除一般行政工作外，最主要的应当是教学辅导工作，所以对于函授教学辅导站的工作人员必须要配备恰当，必须要注意专业知识的培养和提高，否则，函授站的工作人员如果不懂业务，那不仅是个人的一种苦恼，而且直接影响着函授生学习的效果。
    最后，举办函授教育，建立函授教学辅导站，还必须取得当地党委的领导和支持，必须使各机关对于以函授形式培养提高在职干部的意义有足够的认识。在第三届招生时，人民大学天津函授教学辅导站首先同中共天津市委各有关部门商讨招生条件，详细研究可能遇到的问题和解决的办法，并通过市委向各机关分配招生定额。因此第三届所招收的学生，党团员占全体学员的百分之五十四点九，从职务上看，科长级的干部占了百分之四十九点八，这不但保证了函授生的政治质量，也保证了函授生的文化和理论水平，使函授教学辅导站解决了许多不易解决的困难。
