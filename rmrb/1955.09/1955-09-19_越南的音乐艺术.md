    The Musical Art of Vietnam
    Shi Lemeng, Art Director of the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    This April, when the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe came to our country, I was excited to participate in receiving them. They were young, cheerful, and lively. Most of them had participated in the war against the enemy. Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, Vietnamese artists tenaciously and unyieldingly defeated the invaders, winning freedom, happiness, and honor for themselves.
    In the process of working with them and learning from them, I further came into contact with the excellent cultural arts of the Vietnamese people. They have a rich artistic heritage. Taking music as an example, the famous "Hue folk songs" are one such example. For example, Zhu Luan's rendition of "Rowing Boat Song" depicts the girls rowing boats on the Perfume River, entrusting their wishes and thoughts to the songs floating in the wind:
    "Wind and rain blow,
    Catch fish with traps,
    Go home for dinner,
    When I come back, the trap is gone.
    Oh, trap! Since you were taken away,
    Why don't you give me a single message?" This beautiful singing voice and the picturesque river scenery lead us into a moving realm.
      "Quan Ho folk songs" are even more closely integrated with labor. "Quan Ho" is the general term for all the rich folk songs in Bac Ninh Province in northern Vietnam. It is said that in ancient times, a prince passed by a village here, and a tea-picking girl was very ugly, but she sang very well and was loved by the prince. After the two got married, the girl was called "Tea-Picking Queen." These folk songs have been passed down from generation to generation and have become a mass art. People sing while working, and new lyrics are added at any time according to needs, and they compete with each other. For example, "Spring Outing" is a "medley" of six "Quan Ho" folk songs.
    In the central and coastal areas of Vietnam, there are many excellent folk songs describing labor and love everywhere. The Vietnamese people have not only maintained their national musical traditions but have also developed their national music. Before the revolution, patriotic musicians advocated absorbing folk songs for creation. However, this work only developed vigorously after the August Revolution and during the War of Resistance. During the War of Resistance, most of the Vietnamese artists participated in the revolutionary struggle, serving the War of Resistance with literature and art. Literary and art workers underwent arduous training in the war and created many national and combative works. The literary and art workers of the troops organized "Literary and Art Work Sharp Knife Groups" to go deep into the trenches to serve the soldiers and conduct creation. The literary and art work of Vietnam was tested, grew, and became stronger from such war fire. The excellent works such as "Cannon Pulling Song," "Dien Bien Phu Victory," "My Hometown is Liberated," and "Tao River Guerrilla" performed by the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe were produced during this period.
    Now, the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe has begun its visit and performance in our country. Their simple and combative performances will surely be welcomed and praised by our people with cordiality and enthusiasm.

    越南的音乐艺术
    中国人民解放军总政治部歌舞团艺术指导　时乐濛
    今年四月，当越南人民歌舞团来到我国的时候，我怀着兴奋的心情参加了接待他们的工作。他们年青、愉快、活泼。大多数都曾参加过抗敌战争。越南的文艺工作者在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，顽强不屈地战胜了侵略者，给自己赢得了自由、幸福和荣誉。
    在和他们一起工作和向他们学习的过程中，我进一步接触到了越南人民的优秀的文化艺术。他们有丰富的艺术遗产。拿音乐来说，闻名的“顺化民歌”，就是例子。如珠鸾演唱的“划船号子”，描绘香江上划船的姑娘们把自己的愿望和心事寄托在随风飘荡的歌声中：
    “刮风下雨，
    拿筌拦鱼，
    回家吃饭，
    来时筌已不见。
    筌呀！自从你被带走，
    为什么不给我一丝的音讯？”这优美的歌声和秀丽的江景把我们引入动人的境界。
      “官贺民歌”更是和劳动紧密地结合着。“官贺”（译音）是越南北部北宁省所有丰富的民歌的总称。据说古代有个王子路过这里的一个乡村，有个采茶姑娘长的很丑，但歌子唱的很好，为王子所爱，二人结婚后，姑娘被称为“采茶后”。这些民歌世代相传，成为群众性的艺术，一方面劳动一方面歌唱，并根据需要随时编进新的歌词，互相竞赛。如“春游”就是六首“官贺”民歌的“联唱”。
    在越南的中部和滨海区域，到处都有着许多描写劳动和爱情的优秀民歌。越南人民不仅保持了他们的民族音乐传统，并且发展了他们的民族音乐。在革命前爱国的音乐家们就曾主张吸收民歌进行创作。但这一工作只有在八月革命后，在抗战中才得到了蓬勃的发展。在抗战中，越南的文艺工作者绝大部分参加了革命斗争，以文艺为抗战服务。文艺工作者在战争中艰苦锻炼，创作了许多富有民族性、战斗性的作品，部队的文艺工作者组织了“文艺工作尖刀组”深入战壕为战士服务及进行创作。越南的文艺工作就是从这样的战火中考验、成长、壮大起来的。越南人民歌舞团演出的“拉炮歌”、“奠边府大捷”、“我的家乡解放了”、“滔河游击队”等优秀作品就是产生在这个时期。
    现在，越南人民歌舞团已经开始了在我国的访问演出，他们的朴实的，富有战斗力量的表演定将获得我国人民亲切的、热情的欢迎和赞扬。
