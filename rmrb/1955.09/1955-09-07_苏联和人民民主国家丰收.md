    Soviet Union
    Agricultural workers throughout the Soviet Union are completing their annual plans for selling and delivering agricultural products to the state ahead of schedule.
    Currently, the Soviet Union has harvested more than half of its grain. Many provinces, territories, and republics have already completed their plans for supplying grain to the state, with grain supplies generally exceeding the level of 1952, the best harvest year after the war. The Krasnodar Territory was the first to complete its plan. Subsequently, seven provinces in Ukraine, including Kharkiv, Kirovograd, and Voroshilovgrad, also completed their plans. These provinces are now continuing to deliver and sell grain to the state, striving to supply an additional 96 million poods of new grain beyond the plan. Recently, the Zaporozhye and Odessa provinces of Ukraine, as well as the Moldavian Republic, have also completed their plans for supplying grain to the state ahead of schedule. These regions are striving to supply 20 million poods more new grain to the state this year than in 1952.
    Czechoslovakia
    Czechoslovak agricultural workers have achieved the largest harvest in the last decade this year. The national average yield per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) has reached 3,000 kilograms. Many state farms and unified agricultural cooperatives have achieved high yields for their crops.
    In the Brno region, the "Miroslav" state farm achieved a record yield of 5,200 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare. The Olbramovice unified agricultural cooperative in the same region harvested 4,600 kilograms of barley per hectare. Unified agricultural cooperatives in the Olomouc region harvested an average of 4,000 to 5,000 kilograms of grain per hectare. In the České Budějovice region and the northwestern Czech unified agricultural cooperatives, barley also yielded around 3,700 kilograms per hectare.
    Hungary
    The "Free People's Daily" published a conversation on the 28th with M. Sok, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Hungary, regarding the harvest situation in Hungary.
    Sok said that extremely rainy weather had hindered the progress of threshing work. However, the speed of harvesting has accelerated in the last ten days. From August 15th to 25th, the amount of threshing by machine tractor stations increased by 40,000 railcars compared to the same period last year.
    Sok said that, based on the available threshing materials, the grain harvest this year will far exceed the figures predicted before the harvest. The advantages of large-scale collective agriculture over individual farming will be fully demonstrated this year. According to preliminary threshing data, agricultural production cooperatives will produce more than 10 quintals of winter wheat per hold (each hold is equal to 0.57 hectares), which is more than one-tenth more than the average of individual farmers. State farms have performed even better, with a yield of more than 13 quintals of winter wheat per hold.
    The harvest of winter barley this year is particularly good. The yield per hold in cooperatives exceeds 13 quintals, and individual farmers also have more than 12 quintals.
    Romania
    Romanian agricultural workers have achieved a greater harvest than in previous years. In Constanta, Craiova, and other provinces in the country, many state farms, collective farms, and mutual aid teams have harvested an average of 4,500 kilograms of wheat and 4,900 kilograms of barley per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu). Individual farmers have also achieved relatively high yields.
    According to estimates by agricultural experts and high-yield farmers, this year Romania will also achieve unprecedented bumper harvests of corn, sunflowers, and beets in the past twenty years. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家丰收
    苏联
    苏联各地农业劳动者纷纷提前完成向国家交售和交纳农产品的年度计划。
    目前，苏联已经收获完一半以上的谷物。不少州、边疆区和加盟共和国已经完成了为国家供应谷物的计划，供应的谷物普遍超过了战后收成最好的一九五二年的水平。最先完成计划的是克拉斯诺达边疆区。接着，乌克兰的哈尔科夫、基洛夫格勒、伏罗希洛夫格勒等七个州也完成了计划，这几个州现在还在继续为国家交纳和交售谷物，争取要为国家超计划多供应九千六百多万普特新粮。最近，乌克兰的萨坡罗什和敖德萨州及摩尔达维亚共和国也提前完成了今年为国家供应粮食的计划，这几个地区正争取使今年为国家供应的新粮比一九五二年多两千万普特。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克农业劳动者今年获得了最近十年来的最大丰收。全国每公顷（合十五市亩）单位面积的平均收获量达到了三千公斤。许多国营农场和统一农业合作社的作物都得到高额的产量。
    在布尔诺州，“米罗斯拉夫”国营农场的冬小麦产量达到最高纪录——每公顷产五千二百公斤。这个州的奥尔布拉莫维茨统一农业合作社，每公顷的大麦收获了四千六百公斤。阿罗木次州的统一农业合作社，平均每公顷收获了四千到五千公斤的谷物。在契斯克·布德约维泽州和捷克西北部的统一农业合作社，每公顷大麦也收获了三千七百公斤左右。
    匈牙利
    “自由人民报”二十八日发表了匈牙利农业部副部长马·索克关于匈牙利收成情况的谈话。
    索克说，极端多雨的气候阻碍了打谷工作的进展。但是，最近十天来收获工作的速度加快了。八月十五日到二十五日，机器拖拉机站的打谷量比去年同时期增加了四万车皮。
    索克说，根据现有的打谷材料，今年谷物的收获量将远远超过收成前所预期的数字。大规模集体农业比单干户的优点今年将充分地表现出来。根据打谷的初步材料，农业生产合作社每一霍尔德（每霍尔德等于零点五七公顷）的冬小麦产量将超过十公担，比单干农民平均多十分之一以上。国营农场的成绩更好，每一霍尔德冬小麦的产量超过了十三公担。
    今年冬大麦的收成特别好。合作社每一霍尔德的收成超过了十三公担，单干户也有十二公担多。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚农业劳动者获得了比往年更大的丰收。在康斯坦萨、克拉约发和国内其他一些州，许多国营农场、集体农庄和共耕社都在每公顷（合十五市亩）的土地上平均收获了四千五百公斤的小麦，四千九百公斤的大麦。个体农民也得到了比较高的产量。
    根据农业专家和丰产能手的估计，今年罗马尼亚的玉蜀黍、向日葵和甜菜等也将得到过去二十年来未曾有过的大丰收。（据新华社讯）
