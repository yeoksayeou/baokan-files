To the Editor:

Last year, in the fourth quarter, the Ministry of Textile Industry invested over 100,000 yuan to improve the ventilation and dust removal equipment in the cotton spinning mills' opening and cleaning workshops. A "dust filter" was installed in the opening and cleaning section of the No. 2 workshop of the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Spinning Mill. This fully mechanized project was designed by engineer Wang Shanguo of the Ministry of Textile Industry. The factory's employees were happily anticipating the early completion of this project. However, the result was quite disappointing.

Due to poor design, the vibrating device of this equipment was malfunctioning. Shortly after installation and use, the floor cotton and dust clogged the filter bags, seriously affecting the exhaust of the dust removal fans. Workers said: "Installing this thing has made the workshop even dustier." At the same time, due to the unstable motor foundation, the return air fan could not operate safely, leading to a series of machine accidents. More seriously, because the original return air equipment was removed, internal air circulation could not be used, making the temperature and humidity of the opening and cleaning section very unstable. This also caused the humid air from the drawing and roving sections to flow into the carding section, resulting in many carding machines rusting. To solve these problems, the factory invited engineer Wang to study the issue and modified the "dust filter" based on his suggestions. However, the result remained the same. And before the equipment modification test was even finished, engineer Wang hurriedly left the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Spinning Mill.

What is strange is that this year, the North China Textile Industry Bureau held an exhibition of safety equipment at the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Spinning Mill, and a model of this equipment was actually exhibited as a successful experience. The workers have been expressing various opinions about this matter. What exactly is going on? I hope the Ministry of Textile Industry will conduct a thorough investigation.

### 为什么把“失败的教训”当作“成功的经验”

    为什么把“失败的教训”当作“成功的经验”编辑同志：
    去年第四季度，纺织工业部为了改善棉纺厂清花车间的通风除尘设备，曾经投资十几万元，在国营天津第一棉纺织厂第二车间清花工段安装了一个“滤尘器”。这个全部机械化的工程，是由纺织工业部汪善国工程师设计的。厂里的职工都高兴地在期待着这个工程的早日完成。但是结果却很叫人失望。
    这项设备由于设计不周，振动的装置不灵，安装好使用不久，地洞花和尘土就把滤尘袋堵住了，严重地影响了除尘风扇的排风。工人们说：安了这个玩艺儿，倒弄得车间里都是尘土了。同时，由于马达地基不稳固，回风扇不能安全运转，发生了一连串的机器事故。更严重的是，因为拆除了原有的回风设备，不能用内气循回，使清花工段的温湿度很不稳定，并且引起并粗工段的潮湿空气流入梳棉工段，以致许多梳棉机都生了锈。为了解决这些问题，厂方就把汪工程师请来研究，并根据他的意见改装了“滤尘器”。但是结果还是老样子。而改装后的设备试验还没有结束，汪工程师便急急忙忙地离开天津棉纺一厂了。
    令人奇怪的是，华北纺织工业管理局今年在天津棉纺一厂举办了一个有关安全设备的展览会，这项设备的缩影竟也被当作成功的经验在会上展览。工人对这件事意见纷纷。究竟是怎么一回事呢？希望纺织工业部进行认真的检查。刘学刚
