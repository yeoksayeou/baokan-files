    Chongqing Health Department Draws Medical Personnel to Assist Factories and Mines in Improving Medical and Health Work
    Recently, the Chongqing Municipal Health Department drew 68 senior and middle-level medical technicians from urban hospitals to form seven medical teams to assist key factories and mines in solving major medical technical problems and improving the medical and health work of the factories and mines. Since the industrial health work of Chongqing Municipality was unified under the leadership of the local health department last year, more than 430 medical cadres have been sent to factories and mines, and various effective measures have been taken to train and cultivate the original medical cadres of the factories and mines. The factory hygiene personnel training courses organized for factories have already trained more than 260 junior and middle-level factory hygiene personnel in rotation, enabling them to improve their basic medical knowledge and basic knowledge of industrial hygiene. Eight urban hospitals have also been designated to establish business contact systems with more than 100 factory and mine medical institutions to provide technical guidance to the medical personnel of the factories and mines. More than 90 senior and middle-level medical technicians such as physicians and medical assistants from factory and mine medical institutions have also been sent to these hospitals to study.
    With the help of the health department, 21 factories and mines in Chongqing have now established 41 workshop health stations. The quality of the work of the health stations is also constantly improving. For example, the workshop health station of Chongqing No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has been able to find out the causes and patterns of workers' injuries and illnesses by studying the production process and labor conditions, and promptly propose prevention methods. Before last year, the surgeons of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Hospital could only perform simple lower abdominal operations such as appendectomy. Now, after specific guidance from the First Workers' Hospital, they can perform more complex gastrointestinal anastomosis and biliary tract surgery.

    重庆卫生部门抽调医务人员协助厂矿改进医疗卫生工作
    重庆市卫生部门最近从城市医院中抽调了六十八名高、中级医务技术人员组成七个医疗队，协助重点厂矿解决重大的医疗技术问题和改进厂矿的医疗卫生工作。重庆市的工业卫生工作自从去年由地方卫生部门统一领导以来，先后派了四百三十多个医务干部到厂矿去，采取了多种有效的办法对厂矿原有医务干部加以训练和培养，为工厂开办的工厂卫生人员训练班，已经轮训了二百六十多名中、初级工厂卫生人员，使他们提高了基础医学知识和工业卫生基本知识；还指定八个城市医院同一百多个厂矿医疗机构建立业务联系制度，对厂矿医务人员进行技术上的辅导，厂矿医疗机构也派出九十多名医师、医士等高、中级医务技术人员到这些医院去学习。
    在卫生部门的帮助下，现在重庆市已有二十一个厂矿共建立了四十一个车间保健站。保健站工作的质量也在不断提高，如重庆第一钢铁厂车间保健站已能从研究生产过程和劳动条件来找出工人伤病的原因和发病规律，并及时提出预防办法。重庆钢铁公司医院的外科医师去年以前只能施行阑尾截除术等较简单的下腹部手术，现在经第一工人医院具体辅导后，已能施行比较复杂的肠胃吻合术和胆道手术。
