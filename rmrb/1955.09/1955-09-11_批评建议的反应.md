Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

The Fourth Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways wrote: The "Reader's Letters" page on June 19 criticized our bureau for discarding cement paper bags at will during the construction of the Fengsha Railway, which is consistent with the actual situation. In order to eliminate waste, we will strictly implement the material management system in our future work.

After the "Reader's Letters" page on July 10 published the critical letter "Why has Sun Shuduan, Director of the Kunshan County Women's Federation, not been working for a long time?", the Organization Department of the CPC Kunshan County Committee replied: Sun Shuduan initially did not show enough humility about her mistakes. After repeated education by the Party organization, she finally made a relatively profound self-criticism and expressed her determination to correct her mistakes. The CPC Kunshan County Committee branch has passed a resolution at the branch general meeting, approved by the general branch, to give Sun Shuduan a public warning within the Party and suggested that she be demoted administratively.

The Lincheng Mine Office of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration wrote: The criticism of our mine's lack of responsible management of equipment and materials in the "Reader's Letters" page on July 17 is correct. We have decided to take concrete measures to improve the management, utilization, and planning of our mine's equipment and materials.

The Changping County Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote: The situation revealed in the letter "Transferring Relationships Should Not Be Careless," published on the "Reader's Letters" page on August 21, is true. Due to the laxity of the Organization Department of the County League Committee in handling the procedures for transferring relationships, and the irresponsibility of Wang Huizhen, the secretary of the Wujie League branch, in transferring League member relationships, the erroneous practice of entrusting a stranger to transfer the relationship occurred. We are determined to learn from this lesson and improve our future work.

After the "Reader's Letters" page on July 24 published a reader's criticism of the Ministry of Construction Engineering for violating financial discipline, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has submitted a self-criticism, deciding to suspend the capital construction of the First Mechanical Construction Company in 1955; and is also preparing a unified adjustment and division plan for the houses mutually occupied by administrative and enterprise units in the past, which will be submitted to the State Council for approval and implementation.

Readers Liao Dapeng and six others wrote to reflect: The Anshan Geological Exploration Company's laboratory has a total of sixty-two technical personnel, and the phenomenon of overstaffing is very serious. We immediately forwarded the letter to the Ministry of Heavy Industry for inspection. After inspection, the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry proved that the situation reflected in the letter was true and has decided to transfer fifteen technical personnel from this laboratory to the Mineral Testing Institute and the three geological exploration companies in North China, Shenyang, and Changsha for work.

The Electrical Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building wrote: The situation pointed out in the letter "A School Building Not Being Used," published on the "Reader's Letters" page on August 15, is true. We have decided to allocate this school building to the Shanghai Wire Factory to serve as the school building for the staff's cultural and remedial classes.

After this newspaper published the letter "Remittance for Purchasing Materials Worth 2,000 Yuan Was Delayed" on July 10, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China wrote to explain that this criticism was correct and has instructed relevant units to learn from the lesson and improve their work.

After this newspaper published the critical letter "More Than 10,000 Brooms Can't Find Their Owners" on August 15, the Jinnan Special District Office of the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Baoji County Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Shaanxi Province respectively wrote to make self-criticisms. The matter has been appropriately handled through consultation between the two parties.

The Guyuan County Grain Bureau of Hebei Province wrote: The "Reader's Letters" page on August 21 criticized Tao Diangong, director of the Fourth District Grain Depot in our county, for his mistake of not cherishing grain. After our inspection, this criticism is consistent with the facts. Tao Diangong has been subjected to the disciplinary measures of being placed on probation within the Party for two years and demoted administratively.

The Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department wrote: The criticism of our department's blindly building the Shimen Reservoir, causing waste, published on the "Reader's Letters" page on August 15 is true. We have already made a self-criticism of this issue and have requested the Ministry of Water Conservancy to give the deserved punishment.
