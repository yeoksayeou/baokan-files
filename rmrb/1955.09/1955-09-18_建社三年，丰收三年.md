    Agricultural Production Cooperatives Achieve Universal Bumper Harvests

    Three Years of Establishment, Three Years of Bumper Harvests
    This year is the third year of bumper harvests for the Taiyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jing County, Anhui Province, in the three years since its establishment.
    The average yield of early rice from more than 220 mu of land in the whole cooperative was 413 jin per mu. According to the area already harvested, the average yield of intermediate rice is 621 jin per mu, exceeding the average rice yield of the whole township last year by more than 40%. It is estimated that the cooperative will harvest 700,000 jin of rice this year alone, more than 200,000 jin more than the same area last year.
    In order to strive for continuous bumper harvests, the members of the cooperative have worked hard this year to improve water conservancy and irrigation conditions, improve planting techniques, and improve the fields with poor soil quality by applying more base fertilizer and reasonable top dressing. When drought occurred in the summer, the members were mobilized to draw water to rescue the crops, so this year's crops grew particularly well. Before the harvest, the twelve production teams all formulated specific harvesting plans, divided into groups according to labor force, and implemented specific division of labor. Under the slogans of "harvest wherever it's ripe" and "harvest quickly and cleanly," they ensured that every grain returned home and that no grain was discarded.
    In order to support the country's realization of the first five-year plan, the members of the cooperative sold more than 37,400 jin of rice in one go after the early rice harvest. After the intermediate rice harvest, they will strive to sell more surplus grain to the state.

### 建社三年，丰收三年

专栏：农业生产合作社普遍大丰收

    建社三年，丰收三年
    今年是安徽泾县太园农业生产合作社办社三年来第三个丰收年头。
    全社二百二十多亩早稻每亩平均收获四百十三斤。根据已收割的面积计算，中稻每亩平均产量为六百二十一斤，超过全乡去年水稻平均产量四成以上。估计全社今年光水稻就可收七十万斤，比去年的同等面积，要多收二十万斤以上。
    为了争取连年丰收，社员们今年曾努力改善了水利灌溉条件，改进了栽种技术，对土质不好的田也以多上底肥和合理追肥的办法进行改良，夏季发生旱象时发动社员车水抢救，所以今年的庄稼长得特别好。在收割前，十二个生产队都订了具体的收割计划，按劳动力情况编分小组，实行具体分工。他们在“黄一块、收一块”和“打得快、打得净”的口号下，保证颗粒还家，不抛撒粮食。
    社员们为了支援国家实现第一个五年计划，早稻收割后，全社一次就卖了稻子三万七千四百多斤。在中稻收割以后，还要争取卖更多的余粮给国家。
