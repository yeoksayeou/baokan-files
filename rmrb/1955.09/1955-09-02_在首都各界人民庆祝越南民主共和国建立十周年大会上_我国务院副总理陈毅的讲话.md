Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

Today we are gathered here to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Please allow me, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend our heartfelt congratulations and highest respects to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people.

Ten years ago, in August 1945, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, launched a general uprising, overthrew the rule of the Japanese occupation authorities at that time, and subsequently established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Soon after the establishment of the Republic, it was subjected to foreign armed intervention, and the Vietnamese people were forced to engage in eight years of arduous and heroic struggle against the colonialists. During the eight years of resistance, the Vietnamese people continuously strengthened their forces, liberated vast areas, and achieved many victories, completely thwarting the colonialists' attempt to re-enslave the Vietnamese people. It was precisely because of the victory of the Vietnamese people and the people of other Indochinese countries in their struggle against aggression that the Geneva Conference, held last year, reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the national rights of the people of the Indochinese countries. The Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against aggression and their firm determination to safeguard world peace have powerfully inspired all people who love freedom, independence, and peace, and have shown the world that a people who control their own destiny are invincible.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully respects and strictly implements all the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The International Commission, composed of India, Poland, and Canada, and headed by the Indian representative, has made useful contributions to the supervision and monitoring of the implementation of the Geneva Accords. Now, the work of realizing ceasefire, transferring, and regrouping troops in Vietnam according to the Geneva Accords has been completed, and attempts to obstruct and sabotage it have been defeated. This is a great victory for the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people in the world.

As a result of the long-term struggle of the Vietnamese people, northern Vietnam has been completely liberated. This has laid a solid foundation for the entire Vietnamese people to strive for a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam. It has also enabled the people of northern Vietnam to develop their economy and culture in a peaceful environment. After the restoration of peace, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam launched the arduous task of healing the wounds of war and building the economy in northern Vietnam, and have achieved remarkable results in a short period of time. Land reform and rent and interest reduction are continuing to be implemented. Transportation has basically recovered. Industrial and agricultural production has seen a significant recovery and development. The people's lives have been improved to a certain extent. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, and with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, will achieve brilliant victories in economic construction, just as they did in the past in the struggle against foreign aggression.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. During the 1954 Geneva Conference, its sincere efforts and initiative were an important factor in facilitating the reaching of an agreement. After the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam actively participated in the cause of promoting peace in Asia and the world. The mutual visits of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, and Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong further strengthened and developed the friendly relations between Vietnam and India, and between Vietnam and Burma. At the historic Asian-African Conference, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sought to improve and strengthen friendly cooperation and good-neighborly relations with Asian and African countries with a proactive spirit. This series of efforts by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has played a positive role in consolidating peace in the Asian region, easing international tensions, and promoting mutual trust and understanding among nations. This shows that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has increasingly become a force to be reckoned with in defending peace in Asia and the world.

Now, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are fighting for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Vietnam has always been an indivisible whole. Achieving national reunification is the rightful and sacred right of the Vietnamese people. The Geneva Accords were reached on the basis of respecting and recognizing the rights of the people of the Indochinese countries to independence, sovereignty, and national unity. Article 6 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference stipulates: "The military demarcation line is provisional and should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary." Article 7 of the Final Declaration further stipulates: Vietnam will hold nationwide elections in July 1956, under the supervision of an international commission composed of representatives of the member states of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission; from July 20, 1955, the responsible authorities of the two regions with representatives should consult on this issue. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on June 6 this year, announcing: "Ready to hold consultative conferences with the responsible authorities of South Vietnam with representatives from July 20, 1955, to discuss the organization of free general elections throughout Vietnam in July 1956." Subsequently, on July 19 this year, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a note to the relevant parties regarding the consultation on the general election in Vietnam. These proactive actions taken by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are of great significance, fully demonstrating the spirit of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to resolutely fulfill the Geneva Accords, and are in full compliance with the interests of the Vietnamese people and the requirements of all peace-loving people. The government of the People's Republic of China fully supports these proactive actions of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

However, certain forces in the international arena are unwilling to see the implementation of the Geneva Accords and are instead intensifying their interference in Indochina. In southern Vietnam, they are expanding the military strength of the South Vietnamese regime, strengthening their control over the South Vietnamese regime, and attempting to turn southern Vietnam into a colony and military base, keeping Vietnam in a state of prolonged division. With the support of external forces, the South Vietnamese authorities openly oppose the Geneva Accords, brazenly refuse to hold consultative conferences, and have taken a series of provocative actions against the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission. All this is hindering the cause of peaceful reunification of the Vietnamese people, exacerbating the tension in Indochina, and threatening the Geneva Accords with serious disruption. This must be given serious attention by all parties concerned. The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have an obligation to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords and should jointly promote consultations between the two sides in Vietnam in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam through general elections. This is the responsibility that the relevant parties to the Geneva Accords and the countries participating in the Geneva Conference cannot shirk.

Recently, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries and people around the world, the summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France in Geneva has achieved positive results, and international tensions have eased to some extent. This provides more favorable conditions for resolving outstanding international issues through peaceful consultations. This will undoubtedly help the realization of the general election and reunification of Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords. If the parties concerned, especially the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina, are willing to promote the further easing of the international situation and intend to fulfill their obligations, then they should actively take effective measures to stop all actions that undermine the Geneva Accords.

The People's Republic of China respects the provisions of the Geneva Accords and is willing to work with all parties concerned to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese people are by no means isolated in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving people all over the world stand with the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people will continue to give full support to the just cause of the Vietnamese people in striving for the peace, unity, independence, and democracy of their motherland.

The people of China and Vietnam have a long and profound friendship. For centuries, our two peoples have been sympathizing with and supporting each other in their respective struggles against foreign aggression and for national liberation. The Chinese people always regard every victory of the Vietnamese people as their own victory and are inspired by the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. The friendship between our two peoples is based on the spirit of internationalism and on the common determination to defend peace in Asia and the world. This noble friendship is an unbreakable fraternal friendship. The Chinese people cherish this friendship very much. The friendly visit to our country by the delegation of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh in June this year, the sincere talks held between the governments of China and Vietnam on issues of common concern, and the significant results achieved have brought the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of China and Vietnam to a new stage. We must continue to develop and consolidate this friendly and cooperative relationship between our two peoples.

Please allow me, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, to once again warmly congratulate the great Vietnamese people on this glorious festival, and to congratulate them on achieving even greater successes in economic and cultural construction and in the struggle for the peace, unity, independence, and democracy of their motherland.

Long live the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples!

Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!
   
 Long Live the Vietnam Workers' Party!
   
 Long Live President Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Vietnamese people!

### 在首都各界人民庆祝越南民主共和国建立十周年大会上  我国务院副总理陈毅的讲话

    在首都各界人民庆祝越南民主共和国建立十周年大会上
    我国务院副总理陈毅的讲话敬爱的大使同志、同志们、朋友们：
    今天我们在这里举行这个大会来庆祝越南民主共和国建立的十周年，请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，向越南民主共和国政府和越南人民表示衷心的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    十年以前，一九四五年八月，越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下举行了总起义，推翻了当时日本占领当局的统治，随后并建立了越南民主共和国。共和国成立不久，就遭到外来的武装干涉，越南人民于是又被迫同殖民主义者进行了八年艰苦的、英勇的斗争。在八年抗战中，越南人民不断地壮大了自己的力量，解放了广大的地区，取得了许多胜利，使殖民主义者重新奴役越南人民的企图遭到了彻底的失败。正是由于越南人民和其他印度支那国家人民反对侵略斗争的胜利，才使得去年召开的日内瓦会议在尊重印度支那各国人民的民族权利的基础上，就恢复印度支那和平达成了协议。越南人民反抗侵略的英勇斗争和保卫世界和平的坚强意志，有力地鼓舞了一切爱好自由、独立和和平的人民，并且向全世界显示出：把自己国家的命运掌握在自己手里的人民是不可战胜的。
    越南民主共和国完全尊重并严格地执行着日内瓦协议的一切规定。由印度、波兰和加拿大组成的，以印度代表为首的国际委员会对监督和监察日内瓦协议的实施，做了有益的贡献。现在，根据日内瓦协议在越南实现停火和转移、集结军队的工作已经完成，阻挠和破坏它的企图遭到了失败。这是越南人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的伟大胜利。
    由于越南人民长期斗争的结果，越南北部已经得到了完全的解放。这就为全体越南人民争取实现一个和平、统一、独立、民主和繁荣的越南奠定了巩固的基础。这也使北半部的越南人民有可能在和平的环境中发展自己的经济和文化。在和平恢复之后，越南民主共和国政府和人民在越南北半部展开了医治战争创伤和建设经济的艰巨工作，并在短短的时间内获得了显著的成就。土地改革和减租减息正在继续贯彻。交通运输已基本上恢复。工农业生产已有显著的恢复和发展。人民的生活已得到了一定的改善。中国人民坚信：越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助下，将会在经济建设的工作中，正如同过去在抗击外来侵略的斗争中一样，获得辉煌的胜利。
    越南民主共和国一贯执行着和平的对外政策。在一九五四年日内瓦会议期间，它的真诚努力和主动精神是促使达成协议的一个重要因素。在印度支那和平恢复后，越南民主共和国又积极参加了促进亚洲和世界和平的事业。印度尼赫鲁总理、缅甸吴努总理、越南民主共和国范文同副总理的相互访问，进一步加强和发展了越印、越缅的友好关系。越南民主共和国在历史性的亚非会议上，以积极主动的精神谋求改善和加强同亚非国家间的友好合作和善邻关系。越南民主共和国这一系列的努力，对于巩固亚洲地区的和平，和缓国际紧张局势和促进国际间的互相信任和谅解起了积极的作用。这说明越南民主共和国已日益成为保卫亚洲和世界和平的一支不容忽视的力量。
    现在，越南民主共和国政府和人民正在为彻底实施日内瓦协议和争取祖国的和平统一而斗争。越南从来就是一个不可分割的整体。实现祖国的统一是越南人民理所当然的神圣权利。日内瓦协议就是在尊重和承认印度支那各国人民的独立、主权和国家统一的权利的基础上达成的。日内瓦会议最后宣言第六条规定：“军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界。”最后宣言第七条更进一步规定：越南将在一九五六年七月内，在国际监督和监察委员会成员国代表所组成的国际委员会的监督下举行全国选举；自一九五五年七月二十日起，双方地区有代表性的负责当局，应该就此项问题进行协商。越南民主共和国政府在今年六月六日发表声明，宣布：“准备从一九五五年七月二十日起同南越有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论在一九五六年七月在越南全国举行自由普选的组织问题。”此后在今年七月十九日，越南民主共和国政府又向有关方面发出关于越南普选协商的照会。越南民主共和国政府所采取的这些积极行动，具有重大的意义，充分表现了越南民主共和国坚决履行日内瓦协议的精神，并完全符合越南人民的利益和一切爱好和平人民的要求。中华人民共和国政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府的这些积极行动。
    但是，国际上某些势力却不愿意看到日内瓦协议的实施，反而加紧在印度支那进行干涉。在越南南部，它们正在扩大南越政权的军事力量，加强对南越政权的控制，企图变越南南部为殖民地和军事基地，使越南长期处于分裂的状态。南越当局在外来势力的支持下公开反对日内瓦协议，悍然拒绝举行协商会议，并对国际监督和监察委员会采取了一连串的挑衅行动。这一切都阻碍着越南人民和平统一的事业、加剧着印度支那的紧张局势，使日内瓦协议遭到严重被破坏的威胁。这是必须引起有关各方深切注意的。日内瓦会议与会各国有义务保证日内瓦协议的履行，应该共同促使越南双方进行协商，以求通过普选达到越南的和平统一。这是日内瓦协议有关双方和日内瓦会议与会各国所不能推卸的责任。
    最近以来，由于全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的努力，在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议获得了积极的成果，国际间的紧张局势已经有了一定程度的和缓。这就为通过和平协商来解决悬而未决的国际问题提供了更加有利的条件。这对于依照日内瓦协议实现越南的普选和统一无疑也是有所帮助的。如果有关各方，特别是关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦会议与会各国，愿意促进国际局势的进一步和缓，并打算履行自己所承担的义务，那末就应该积极采取有效的措施，制止一切破坏日内瓦协议的行动。
    中华人民共和国尊重日内瓦协议的各项规定，并愿意同有关各方一起保证日内瓦协议的实施。越南人民在争取自己祖国的和平统一的斗争中绝不是孤立的。苏联、中国和全世界爱好和平的人民，都同越南人民站在一起。中国人民将继续对越南人民争取祖国的和平、统一、独立、民主的正义事业给予全力的支持。
    中越两国人民有着悠久深厚的友谊。一世纪以来，我们两国人民在各自反对外来侵略、争取民族解放的斗争中一直是相互同情和支持的。中国人民总是把越南人民的每一个胜利看作是自己的胜利，并从越南人民的英勇斗争中得到鼓舞。我们两国人民的友谊是建立在国际主义精神的基础之上，是建立在共同保卫亚洲和世界和平的决心之上的。这种崇高的友谊是牢不可破的兄弟友谊。中国人民十分珍视这种友谊。以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团在今年六月来我国进行的友好访问，中越两国政府就共同有关的问题举行的恳切会谈和取得的重大成果，使中越两国人民的友好合作关系进入了一个新的阶段。我们一定要继续发展和巩固我们两国人民间的这种友好合作关系。
    请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民再一次热烈祝贺伟大的越南人民的这个光荣的节日，祝贺他们在经济和文化建设中，在争取祖国的和平、统一、独立、民主的斗争中，获得更大的成就。
    中越人民亲密的兄弟友谊万岁！
    越南民主共和国万岁！
    越南劳动党万岁！
    越南人民的领袖胡志明主席万岁！
