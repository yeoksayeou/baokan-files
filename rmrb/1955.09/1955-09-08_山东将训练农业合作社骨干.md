Shandong to Train Backbone Personnel for Agricultural Cooperatives

    In order to meet the upcoming high tide of cooperativization and to adapt to the needs of expanding 700,000 households in existing old cooperatives and developing more than 50,000 new cooperatives throughout the province this winter and next spring, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to train more than 480,000 backbone personnel for agricultural cooperatives this winter and next spring. The training will be conducted in phases. The first batch will mainly provide universal training to the heads, accountants, technicians, and production team leaders of the existing 88,000-plus cooperatives. Through short-term study, they will be assisted in summarizing this year's production work, clearing accounts, and arranging all specific tasks for expanding cooperatives with development potential. The second batch will consist of mutual aid team leaders and activists who are preparing to transition to cooperatives this winter. Through study, they will learn to solve the main problems they will encounter during the transition. All new cooperative accountants will be specially trained in a concentrated manner, and they must learn the basic knowledge of accounting transactions and financial management. At present, all counties have made specific training plans, and they have also carefully selected and reviewed the personnel to be involved. According to the training situation that has already begun in areas such as Tai'an and Linyi, most of the participants are Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists in running cooperatives. This will play an important role in ensuring the steady development of agricultural cooperativization this winter and next spring. (Our correspondent in Jinan)

    山东将训练农业合作社骨干
    中共山东省委为了迎接即将来临的合作化高潮，适应今冬明春全省老社扩大七十万余户与发展新社五万多处的需要，决定今冬明春训练农业合作社的骨干四十八万多人。训练将分期进行，第一批主要是把现有八万八千多处社的社长、会计、技术员、大社生产队长普遍训练一次，通过短期学习，帮助他们总结好今年的生产工作，清理好账目，有发展条件的安排扩大社的一切具体工作；第二批是今冬准备转社的互助组组长和办社的积极分子，通过学习，使他们学会解决在转社中将要遇到的主要问题。所有新社会计要专门集中训练，起码要学会账目往来和财务管理的基本知识。目前各县都作出了具体训练计划，对准备参加的人员也都认真地作了挑选和审查，据泰安、临沂等地区已开始训练的情况来看，所参加的人多数是共产党员、青年团员和办社的积极分子，这对保证今冬明春农业合作化的稳步发展将起着重要的作用。　（本报驻济南记者）
