Agricultural Production Cooperatives Achieve Universal Bumper Harvests

    Good Crops Are Sure to Come from Agricultural Cooperatives

    In Xifeng County, Liaoning Province, there are a total of 467 agricultural production cooperatives. The crops of these cooperatives, with the exception of a few that suffered slight yield reductions due to drought, generally show signs of a bumper harvest. Throughout the county, one can hear comments like: "Wherever the crops grow lush and strong, with thick stalks, large ears, and plump grains, it must be from a cooperative." The crop yields of agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county are generally higher than those of mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the area. For example, the crops of the Lianmeng and Shengping cooperatives, along with four other agricultural production cooperatives in Yushu Village, Gengk Township, after preliminary investigation, are estimated to yield about 20 to 30 percent more than the crops of mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the village. Recently, the county investigated 62 agricultural production cooperatives during the rectification of cooperatives. Among them, 56 cooperatives had crop yields that were 20 to 30 percent higher than those of local mutual aid teams, with some even exceeding them by 40 percent; only 6 cooperatives had yields equal to those of general mutual aid teams. Many cooperatives' newly opened paddy fields have also achieved bumper harvests. The Shengli Cooperative in Fangmu Village, Fangmu Township, converted 378 mu of low-yielding waterlogged land into paddy fields this spring. Each mu can now produce an average of more than 600 jin, an increase of more than 390 jin compared to before the conversion. Some cooperative members who originally planned to withdraw from the cooperative after the autumn harvest, upon seeing the bumper harvest of the paddy fields, felt that individual farming would not have the power to open up paddy fields and were now content to stay in the cooperative. Many farmers outside the cooperatives, seeing the fact that the cooperatives' development of paddy fields increased production, are also actively preparing to join the cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

专栏：农业生产合作社普遍大丰收

    好庄稼准是农业合作社的
    辽宁省西丰县共有四百六十七个农业生产合作社，这些合作社的庄稼，除个别社因受旱灾略有减产外，普遍呈现丰收景象。在县内到处可以听到这样的舆论：“哪块庄稼长的又黑又壮，秸粗穗大，籽粒饱满，准是合作社的。”全县农业生产合作社的庄稼产量普遍高于当地互助组和单干农民。如更刻区榆树村联盟和升平等六个农业生产合作社的庄稼，经过初步调查，可比该村互助组及单干农民的庄稼多收百分之二十到三十左右。最近县里在整社中调查过六十二个农业生产合作社，其中有五十六个社的产量可比当地互助组的庄稼高出百分之二十到三十，有的甚至高出百分之四十；仅有六个社的产量和一般互助组庄稼产量相等。很多社新开水田也都获得丰收。房木区房木村胜利社今春把三百七十八亩打粮很少的涝洼地改成了水田，每亩平均可产六百多斤，较改变前增产三百九十多斤。有的社员原先打算秋后退社，一看到水田丰收，觉得单干就没这大力量开水田，也安心在社里了。很多社外农民看到合作社开发水田增产的事实，也积极准备秋后入社。
