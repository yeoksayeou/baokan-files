    A new type of hump yard is under construction next to Fengtai Station in Beijing. The yard covers a large area, with a total of more than 140 kilometers of track to be laid and many new communication signal and other equipment to be installed. Fengtai Station is a hub connecting the major railway lines in the north and the ring lines around Beijing. With the development of economic construction and the increase in traffic, the shunting task of this station has become increasingly heavy. The first phase of the new marshalling yard is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, at which time it will be able to undertake one-third of the shunting tasks of Fengtai Station, basically eliminating the phenomenon of station congestion.

    丰台车站兴建驼峰式调车场
    北京丰台车站旁边正在兴建一座新型的驼峰式调车场。调车场的面积很大，里面将要铺设共长一百四十多公里的线路，并安装许多新的通讯信号等设备。丰台车站是连接北方各主要铁路干线和北京环城各线的枢纽。随着经济建设的发展，来往车辆增加，这个车站的调车任务日益繁重。新调车场的第一期工程计划在今年年底完成，那时它就可担负丰台车站三分之一的调车任务，基本上消灭车站的堵塞现象。（新华社）
