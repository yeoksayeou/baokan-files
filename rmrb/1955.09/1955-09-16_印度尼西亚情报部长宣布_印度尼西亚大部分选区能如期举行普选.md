Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 15th: Indonesian Minister of Information, Makmur, said at a press conference on the 14th that he expects 90 percent of all electoral districts in Indonesia will be able to hold general elections on September 29th.

Makmur said that out of 208 electoral districts, 24 have definitively stated that they will not be able to hold elections on September 29th. Of the remaining 184 electoral districts, approximately 50 percent have announced that they will be able to hold elections as scheduled, while the other 50 percent have notified the Central Election Committee that they may be able to hold elections on September 29th if they have the necessary voting materials and other equipment. Makmur said that the government has transported the necessary materials and equipment to the relevant areas, and therefore he expects these areas to be able to vote as scheduled.

Makmur said that he estimates the election results for the island of Java will be known approximately one month to one and a half months after the voting. He estimates that, for all of Indonesia, the election results for the outer islands will take three months to be revealed. He said that therefore, the new parliament is expected to be established within six months.

He said that it is certain that the entire island of Java will hold elections on September 29th with 100 percent certainty. Java is the most densely populated island in Indonesia. There are approximately 30 million registered voters.

According to the latest statistics from the Indonesian Central Election Committee, there are a total of 77,987,879 Indonesian citizens, with 43,104,464 registered voters.

    印度尼西亚情报部长宣布
    印度尼西亚大部分选区能如期举行普选
    新华社雅加达十五日电　印度尼西亚情报部长马克慕尔十四日在记者招待会上说，他预料全印度尼西亚的百分之九十的选区将能够在九月二十九日举行普选。
    马克慕尔说，在二百零八个选区中，有二十四个已经肯定地说，不能够在九月二十九日举行投票，其余一百八十四个选区中约百分之五十宣布能够如期投票，而其他百分之五十的选区已通知中央选举委员会说，如果它们具备投票的必要物资和其他设备的话，它们可能在九月二十九日举行投票。马克慕尔说，政府已经把必要的物资和设备运送到有关地区去，因此他预料这些地区能够如期投票。
    马克慕尔说，他估计爪哇岛的选举结果可以在投票后约一个月到一个半月内知道。他估计，就全印度尼西亚来说，各外岛选举的结果需要三个月才能揭晓。他说，因此，新国会可望在六个月内成立。
    他说，可以肯定，爪哇全岛将百分之百地在九月二十九日举行投票。爪哇是印度尼西亚人口最稠密的岛屿。登记的选民约有三千万名。
    据印度尼西亚中央选举委员会最近的统计，印度尼西亚公民共有七千七百九十八万七千八百七十九人，登记的选民有四千三百一十万零四千四百六十四名。
