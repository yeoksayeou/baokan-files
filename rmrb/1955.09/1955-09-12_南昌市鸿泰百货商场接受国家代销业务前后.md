Nanchang Hongtai Department Store Before and After Accepting National Consignment Business
By Sun Zunian, our reporter

On Shengli Street in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, there is a store with very good business and many customers. This is the Nanchang Hongtai Department Store, a specialized consignment store of the China National Department Store Company.

Hongtai is a large and long-established private department store in Nanchang. Before liberation, it developed from a cotton cloth wholesale business to a retail department store, with a purchasing station in Shanghai and long-term purchase and sales contracts with some cotton textile and rubber shoe manufacturers. For a long time, this store engaged in speculative activities, operating in expensive department stores and luxury goods through selling short, blindly pursuing high profits. After liberation, with the growth and development of state-owned and cooperative commerce, and the change in consumption targets and habits, the blind operation of capitalist commerce became increasingly unable to meet the needs of market development. The Hongtai Department Store did not see the changes taking place in the market during the socialist transformation of private commerce, and continued to blindly engage in speculative trading using capitalist business methods. In the winter of 1953, the owners of Hongtai Department Store saw a shortage of woolen sweaters in the Nanchang market, and the state-owned company also had no goods, so they quickly sent people to Shanghai to purchase fifty dozen woolen sweaters. By the time the goods arrived, the state-owned company's woolen sweaters had also arrived. Because the quality of these woolen sweaters was worse than the state-owned ones, but the price was 5% higher, they could not be sold. Later, they lowered the price of each item to the same as the state-owned company, and only sold them out after April 1954. Subsequently, state-owned commerce replaced the cotton cloth wholesale industry, and many private manufacturers implemented processing, ordering, purchasing, and exclusive sales for state-owned enterprises. State-owned companies further controlled the source of goods, and the speculative activities of capitalist commerce were further restricted. Especially after the announcement of the General Line, the masses complained that the goods in Hongtai Department Store were more expensive than those in state-owned companies, and they were unwilling to buy goods there. At this time, Hongtai Department Store exposed more serious shortcomings such as bloated organization, huge expenses, and backward management. Business volume declined day by day, resulting in monthly losses, and the enterprise could not be sustained. From January to June 1954, the total business volume decreased significantly compared with the same period in 1953, but expenses did not decrease as before. As a result, the total loss in the first half of the year was 11,532 yuan. In addition to the owner's advance of 5,000 yuan, the company's working capital was short by 2,290 yuan, and the inventory was only worth 3,000 yuan. Wages and expenses could not be paid. Not only was there no working capital, but there was also a debt of 2,200 yuan. They tasted the inevitable result of capitalist business methods.

At this most difficult time, the manager of Hongtai Department Store went to Shanghai to handle the business of closing the purchasing station, intending to stop operations. After arriving in Shanghai, he saw the Lihua Company hanging up the sign of "Shanghai Professional Consignment Store of China National Department Store Company," and learned that the business of Lihua Company had improved after operating consignment business. At this time, he felt that private commerce could only have a future by accepting the transformation of the state. After returning to Nanchang, the employees heard about this situation and asked the manager to apply to the Nanchang State-owned Company for consignment. After being approved by the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Hongtai Department Store officially accepted the national consignment business on June 20, 1954.

After consignment, Hongtai Department Store fully accepted the leadership of the state-owned company and changed its capitalist business methods. They improved their business style and strengthened business planning. The state-owned company stipulated the scope of consignment commodities, handling fees, and security deposits. According to the enterprise's operating capacity and market supply and demand, they compiled quarterly and monthly turnover plans for consignment commodities to the state-owned company. They had to submit several monthly reports every month. All commodities were clearly marked with prices and sold at the retail prices of the state-owned company. The consignment payments were all transferred to the designated special account of the People's Bank by the state-owned company on the same day, and the payment voucher was sent to the state-owned company for verification to see if it was consistent with the daily sales report. The state-owned company also sent a resident representative to supervise and guide the operation and management of the consignment store, and to inspect the prices, finances, and commodity storage of consignment commodities. They also adjusted wages. The manager voluntarily reduced his salary, and expenses were reduced from 2,200 yuan per month to 840 yuan. The enterprise established a group management responsibility system, with each group managing the sale of commodities separately. Inventory and reconciliation were carried out every night, and a group life meeting was held every week to check work attitude and implementation of the system. There were also occasional business studies. Through these activities, the awareness of the employees was further improved. After becoming a consignment store of the state-owned company, there were more customers. In the off-season, the daily turnover was nearly 800 yuan, and in the peak season, the daily turnover reached 1,000 to 1,200 yuan, which was a 50% increase compared to the daily turnover in the peak season before consignment. This was something that Hongtai Department Store had never experienced in the past.

The overall changes after consignment were: the business volume gradually increased, 43.8% higher in July than in June, and 83.01% higher in August than in July. After September, there was still a slight profit. After entering the off-season this year, the monthly turnover can still maintain around 20,000 yuan, and there is a slight surplus. In May last year, the turnover was 1,530 yuan, and the profit was 200 yuan, but the expenses for one month were 2,400 yuan, resulting in a loss of 2,200 yuan. In May this year, the turnover was 23,436 yuan, the consignment handling fee was 1,074 yuan (calculated at 4.5% of the turnover), and the expenses (salaries of labor and management, management fees, rent, electricity, store rent, etc.) were 946 yuan, leaving a surplus of 138 yuan. Now the normal monthly turnover reaches 23,873 yuan, which is 15 and a half times higher than the lowest turnover before consignment. Not only is revenue and expenditure balanced, but there is also a monthly surplus, which shows the superiority of private commerce taking the road of state capitalism.

Faced with this fact, Zhang Zhaosheng, the manager of Hongtai Department Store, said emotionally at the Municipal People's Congress: "The result of taking the road of state capitalism in the past year has rejuvenated the paralyzed Hongtai Department Store. This fully shows that private commerce can only continue to move forward in the process of socialist transformation by relying on the Communist Party and the People's Government, loyally accepting the leadership of the state-owned economy, loving the country, abiding by the law, actively operating, and serving the people."

    南昌市鸿泰百货商场接受国家代销业务前后
    本报记者　孙祖年
    在江西南昌市胜利街头，有一家商店的生意很好，购买物品的人很多。这就是中国百货公司南昌市鸿泰百货专业代销商场。
    鸿泰是南昌市规模较大、历史较久的私营百货商场。解放前是由经营棉布批发发展为零售百货商场的，在上海设有采购站，同一些棉织、胶鞋厂商签有长期购销合同。这个商场长时期从事投机活动，以卖空买空的方式，经营高贵的百货和奢侈品，盲目追求高额利润。解放后，随着国营和合作社商业的壮大和发展，消费对象和消费习惯的转变，资本主义商业的盲目经营愈来愈不能适应市场发展的需要。鸿泰商场没有看到在对私营商业进行社会主义改造过程中市场上发生的变化，仍然盲目地以资本主义经营方式进行投机买卖。一九五三年冬季快到的时候，鸿泰百货商场的业主看到南昌市面上绒衣缺货，国营公司也没有货，就迅速派人到上海购进五十打绒衣。等到货物运到，国营公司的绒衣也到了。因为这批绒衣质量比国营的差，价格却比国营公司的贵百分之五，所以卖不出去。后来他们把每件价格降低到同国营公司一样，一直到一九五四年四月以后才卖完。随后国营商业代替了棉布批发业，不少私营厂商实行为国营企业加工、订货、收购、包销，国营公司进一步掌握了货源，资本主义商业的投机活动也进一步受到限制。特别是总路线公布后，群众嫌鸿泰商场的货物比国营公司贵，都不愿去买货。这时鸿泰商场更暴露了机构臃肿、开支庞大、经营管理落后等严重缺点，营业额日益下降，月月有亏蚀，企业无法维持。一九五四年一至六月，营业总额比一九五三年同期降低了很多，但开支并不比以前减少。因而上半年总共亏蚀一万一千五百三十二元，企业流动资金除业主垫款五千元外，还短二千二百九十元，存货只值三千元，工资和开支没法支付，不但没有流动资金，还负债二千二百元。他们尝到了资本主义经营方式所造成的必然结果。
    在这最困难的时候，鸿泰商场的经理去上海办理结束采购站的业务，打算停止营业。到上海以后，他看到丽华公司挂出“中国百货公司上海专业代销店”的牌子，并且了解到经营代销业务后丽华公司营业好转的情况。这时，他感到私营商业只有接受国家的改造，才有前途。回南昌后，职工们听到这一情况，都要求经理向南昌市国营公司申请代销。经市商业局批准后，在一九五四年六月二十日鸿泰商场正式接受了国家代销业务。
    代销后，鸿泰商场完全接受了国营公司的领导，改变了资本主义经营方式。他们改善了经营作风，加强了经营计划性，由国营公司规定了代销商品的范围、手续费、保证金，按照企业经营能力和市场供需情况，按季按月向国营公司编造代销商品的流转计划，每月要送几种月报表，全部商品明码标价，按国营公司零售牌价出售。代销的货款在当日全部解交给国营公司指定的人民银行专户，并把缴款凭证送国营公司核对，看是否同当日销货日报相符。国营公司还派了驻店代表，监督指导代销店经营管理，对代销商品的价格、财务和商品保管情况进行检查。他们还调整了工资，经理自动降低了工资，费用从每月二千二百元降低到八百四十元。企业建立了分组管理责任制，各组分别管理商品出售。每晚盘点、对账，每星期开一次小组生活会，检查劳动态度和执行制度情况。还有不定期的业务学习。通过这些活动，职工们的觉悟进一步提高了。成为国营公司代销店后，顾客也多起来了，在淡季里每天营业额就将近八百元，旺季每天营业额达到一千元到一千二百元，比代销前的旺季每天营业额增加了百分之五十。这是鸿泰商场过去所从来没有过的。
    在代销后的总的变化是：营业额逐步上升，七月份比六月份上升百分之四十三点八，八月份比七月份上升百分之八十三点零一。九月份以后，还稍微有利。今年进入淡季后，每月仍能保持两万元左右的营业额，并略有盈余。去年五月份的营业额一千五百三十元，利润二百元，但一个月的开支就是二千四百元，亏蚀了二千二百元。今年五月份营业额二万三千四百三十六元，代销手续费一千零七十四元（按营业额百分之四点五计算），开支（劳资双方薪金、管理费、房租、电灯、店租等）九百四十六元，还盈余一百三十八元。现在正常的营业额每月达二万三千八百七十三元，较代销前营业额最低时增加了十五倍半，不但收支平衡，而且月月有盈余，显示了私营商业走国家资本主义道路的优越性。
    面对这个事实，鸿泰商场经理章藻生在市人民代表会议上感动地说：“一年来走国家资本主义道路的结果，使陷于瘫痪的鸿泰商场得到了新生。这充分说明了私营商业只有依靠共产党和人民政府，忠诚地接受国营经济的领导，爱国守法，积极经营，为人民服务，才能在社会主义的改造过程中继续前进。”
