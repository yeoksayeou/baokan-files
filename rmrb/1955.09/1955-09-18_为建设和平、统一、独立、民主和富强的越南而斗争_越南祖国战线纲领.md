To struggle for building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam
--Program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front

Our Vietnam is an independent country with a long history. But since 1862, due to the betrayal of feudal monarchs, our country became a colony of French colonialists, and later occupied by Japanese imperialists. For nearly a century, our people suffered oppression, enslavement, and discord. In order to break free from the rule of the colonialists and to strive for the independence and freedom of the motherland, our people have carried out unyielding and heroic united struggles.

In 1945, just as World War II was ending, our people rose up in the August Revolution, declared independence, and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the French colonialists made a comeback, provoked a war of aggression, and, with the help of American interventionists, prolonged this war in order to reoccupy our country.

Thanks to the unity and determination of our people in resisting the war, and with the full support of peace-loving countries around the world, the 1954 Geneva Nine-Nation Conference reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, restoring peace to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The conference adopted the Final Declaration, recognizing Vietnam's independence, sovereign unity, and territorial integrity, while stipulating a period for consultations to discuss general elections and a deadline for holding free general elections under international supervision to unify Vietnam. This was a great victory for our nation in its struggle for independence.

Now that the troops of both sides have completed their regroupment, the important task for our Vietnamese people at present is to continue to strictly implement the Geneva Accords to consolidate peace, realize the unification of the motherland, and complete the independence and democracy of the whole country.

In terms of history, geography, economy, culture, society, and ethnicity, our Vietnam is a unified country, built by the labor and struggle of our ancestors over many generations, and there is absolutely no force that can divide it. Therefore, all of us Vietnamese people, regardless of North or South, men or women, class or creed, must work together, undertake the sacred duty of unifying the motherland, and, in a complete and free territory, jointly heal the wounds of war, promote civilization, seek happiness, and build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

To consolidate peace and achieve unification, we must strive to overcome all obstacles at home and abroad.

Since the Geneva Conference, American imperialism has tried every possible means to undermine the Geneva Accords, increasingly interfered in Indochina, and placed South Vietnam within the "protection" of the American imperialists' military alliance in Southeast Asia, attempting to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base for it to prepare to re-provoke the Indochina war and disrupt peace in Asia and the world. The sinister plot of American imperialism threatens and violates the sacred rights of our people. We must recognize that consolidating peace and achieving unification are closely linked. Only by shattering the American imperialists' plot to re-provoke war can we achieve the unification of the motherland. Conversely, only by achieving the unification of the motherland can we consolidate peace in Indochina and Asia. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the American imperialists' plot to undermine our country's peace and unification.

At present, there is still a small number of people in our country who do not care about the fate of the motherland, willingly or mistakenly follow American imperialism to undermine peace and divide the country. We sincerely advise them that, for the glorious future of the nation, they should wake up as soon as possible, turn back to fulfill their obligations to the motherland, and contribute to the cause of the motherland's unification. If they are obsessed with their errors and continue to oppose and undermine the unification of the motherland, they will be traitors to the nation, common enemies of the people, and will be spurned and punished by the people.

At present, the social and political situations in the North and South are somewhat different. In order to smoothly achieve the unification of the motherland in a peaceful way, we must take into account the actual conditions of the two regions, take care of the legitimate interests and aspirations of the people of all strata; at the same time, use consultation to achieve free general elections to realize unification, and one side should not force the other or annex the other.

Therefore, we solemnly propose to the people of the whole country, the authorities of the two regions, all parties, all armed forces, all mass organizations, and people from North and South Vietnam, a common program for a unified country.

We request the representatives of all organizations and strata in the North and South to promptly discuss this program and, on the basis of a common program reached through agreement, everyone should strive to fight for the realization of the unification of the motherland.

We request the governments and peoples of all countries that participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference, the governments and peoples of all neutral countries responsible for helping the Vietnamese people thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords, and all peace-loving countries in the world, to fully support the Vietnamese people in completing the cause of national unification; we request the French government, which was a signatory to the Geneva Accords, to fulfill its obligations under this agreement and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

The common program includes the following points:

I. Completing National Independence

The national sovereignty of Vietnam belongs to all Vietnamese nationals, regardless of ethnicity, class, political opinion, or religious belief. Vietnam possesses sacred sovereignty that is inviolable by anyone in any aspect, including politics, military affairs, economy, culture, and diplomacy.

Realizing the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and realizing independence, sovereignty, unification, and territorial integrity are the inviolable rights of Vietnam. Resolutely oppose all actions and conspiracies that undermine the Geneva Accords, and at the same time eliminate the disasters of the colonialist system in Vietnam.

II. Achieving National Unification

Realize national free general elections on schedule to unify the country. The authorities of the North and South shall hold consultations to reach an agreement on the election law and earnestly prepare for free general elections throughout the country.

In view of the current actual situation in the North and South regions, people's congresses and administrative organs with broad powers will be established in each region.

All ethnic groups have the freedom to use and develop their own languages and scripts, and to maintain or change their customs and habits. Within a unified Vietnam, autonomous regions will be established in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities.

In order to meet the urgent demands of the people, the normal relations of economy, culture, society, and so on between the two regions must be rebuilt and the right of free movement between the two regions must be respected.

III. Establishing a Democratic System

The election system is implemented according to the principles of universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot.

The National Assembly elected by free general elections is the highest legislative body of the country. The National Assembly will formulate a new constitution for the whole country. Ensure the privileges of the representatives of the National Assembly, including the representatives of the opposition in the National Assembly.

The government empowered by the National Assembly is the highest administrative body of the country and is responsible to the National Assembly.

Establish a coalition government to strengthen the unity between political parties, strata, ethnic groups and the whole country of Vietnam, and at the same time widely collect good opinions from everyone.

In order to take care of the different situations between the two regions, each region shall have the right to promulgate local laws that are suitable for local characteristics and do not violate the general laws of the country.

When the country has not achieved unification, the responsible authorities in the two regions should allow all parties and people's organizations that advocate peace, unification, independence, and democracy to have legal status and should not discriminate against them. In the free general elections, all legal political parties may jointly draw up a list of candidates or run independently.

IV. Developing the Economy and Improving Production

In order to heal the wounds of war and improve the lives of the people, the national economy must be restored in a planned and step-by-step manner, and Vietnam must be built from an economically backward country into an advanced and prosperous industrial country.

Strive to restore and develop agriculture, restore and develop handicrafts and small industries, fisheries and salt industries, transportation and transportation industries, strive to restore damaged industries, improve the production of existing industries, and gradually build factories that produce daily necessities for the people.

Full unification of the armed forces should be achieved gradually through consultation.

Prohibit the entry of foreign troops, foreign military personnel, and weapons and ammunition into Vietnam; prohibit the establishment of any foreign military bases on the territory of Vietnam; American military personnel stationed in Vietnam must immediately withdraw to their country.

Correctly follow the Geneva Accords, and French troops and military personnel must gradually and completely withdraw from Vietnam.

This front must give play to the great role of workers and peasants - the two major classes that constitute the vast majority of our Vietnamese people.

Peace, unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity are the deep aspirations of all Vietnamese people and are at the same time a sacred and just cause. This cause will surely be victorious. All Vietnamese people should unite quickly, truly closely, and extensively, and resolutely struggle for the early success of the great cause of our entire people! (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th)

    为建设和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南而斗争
    ——越南祖国战线纲领
    我们的越南是一个具有悠久历史的独立国家。但自从一八六二年以来，由于封建王侯的叛卖，我国变成了法国殖民主义者的殖民地，后来又为日本帝国主义所占领。历时将近一个世纪，我国人民遭受压迫奴役和离间。为了摆脱殖民主义者的统治，为了争取祖国的独立和自由，我国人民进行了不屈不挠的和英勇的团结奋斗。
    一九四五年，正当第二次世界大战结束的时候，我国人民奋起进行了八月革命，宣布独立，建立越南民主共和国。但是，法国殖民者卷土重来，挑起侵略战争，并且在美国干涉者的帮助下拖延这个战争，以达到再度侵占我国的目的。
    由于我国人民团结一心，坚决抗战并且受到世界爱好和平国家的全力支持，一九五四年日内瓦九国会议达成了印度支那停止敌对行动协议的签订，恢复了越南、老挝和柬埔寨的和平。会议通过了最后宣言，承认越南的独立、主权统一和领土的完整，同时规定了讨论普选的协商期限和在国际监察下举行自由普选以统一越南的期限。这是我们民族在争取独立斗争中的一个巨大胜利。
    现在双方的军队已经集结完毕，我们越南人民目前的重要任务是继续严格地履行日内瓦协定以巩固和平、实现祖国的统一并完成全国的独立、民主。
    在历史、地理、经济、文化、社会和民族等各个方面，我们的越南是一个统一的国家，是由我们的祖先多少世代的劳动和斗争而建成的，是绝对没有任何力量能够分割的。因此，我们全体越南人民不分南北、男女、阶级和信仰，都要同心协力，承担起统一祖国的神圣义务，并且在完整、自由的领土上，共同医治战争的创伤，促进文明和谋求幸福，建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主与富强的越南。
    要巩固和平，实现统一，我们必须努力克服国内外的一切障碍。
    日内瓦会议后，美帝国主义千方百计破坏日内瓦协议、日益深入地干涉印度支那，把南越划入美帝国主义在东南亚的军事联盟的“保护”范围内，企图长期分割越南，把南越变成它准备重新挑起印度支那战争、破坏亚洲和世界和平的殖民地和军事基地。美帝国主义的罪恶阴谋威胁和侵犯了我国人民的神圣权利。我们必须认清：巩固和平和实现统一是密切结合的。只有粉碎美帝国主义重新挑起战争的阴谋，才能实现祖国的统一。反过来说，只有实现祖国的统一，才能巩固印度支那和亚洲的和平。因此，我们必须坚决反对美帝国主义破坏我国的和平和统一的阴谋。
    目前，在我国还有一小部分人不关心祖国的命运，甘心或走错路而追随美帝国主义破坏和平，分割国家。我们真诚地劝告他们，为了民族的光辉前途，他们应该及早醒悟，回过头来完成对祖国应尽的义务，对祖国的统一事业作出贡献。如果他们执迷不悟，继续反对并且破坏祖国的统一，他们将是民族的罪人，是人民的共同敌人，并且将要为人民所唾弃和惩罚。
    目前，北方和南方的社会和政治情况有所不同。要想以和平方式来顺利地实现祖国的统一，我们必须照顾两个地区的实际情况，照顾各阶层人民的正当利益和愿望；同时，以协商办法达到自由普选来实现统一，而不应该由一方强迫另一方或者并吞另一方。
    因此，我们郑重向全国人民、两个地区的当局、各个党派、各个军队、各个群众团体、北越和南越的人士提出一个统一国家的共同纲领。
    我们要求北方及南方两个地区各个组织、各阶层的代表迅速根据本纲领进行商讨，并在达成协议的共同纲领的基础上，每一个人都为实现祖国的统一而努力斗争。
    我们要求曾经参加一九五四年日内瓦会议的各国政府和人民、负有责任帮助越南人民彻底履行日内瓦协定的各个中立国政府和人民以及世界爱好和平各国，全力支持越南人民完成国家的统一事业；我们要求法国政府，即曾经签订日内瓦协定的一方，应该完成它对这个协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言所承担的义务。
    共同纲领包括下列诸点：
    一、完成民族独立
    越南的国家主权属于不分民族、阶级、政治见解、宗教信仰的越南全体国民所有。在政治、军事、经济、文化、外交等任何方面，越南具有任何人不可侵犯的神圣主权。
    实现日内瓦会议最后宣言，实现独立、主权、统一、领土完整是越南不可侵犯的权利。坚决反对一切破坏日内瓦协定的行动和阴谋，同时清除殖民主义制度在越南的灾祸。

    通过自由普选选出国会。国会选出中央联合政府。鉴于北方和南方两地区的目前实际情况，将成立每一地区的人民选举大会和具有广泛权限的行政机关。
    保障国内各民族的平等权，加强团结，禁止民族离间。各民族都有采用和发展自己的语言和文字、保持或改变自己的风俗习惯的自由。在统一的越南国内，将在少数民族聚居地区成立自治区。
    为了满足人民的迫切要求，要重建两个地区之间的经济、文化、社会等方面的正常关系和尊重两个地区之间的自由往来的权利。
    三、建立民主制度
    越南人民具有信仰、言论、出版、集会、结社的自由权，以及自由居住、自由往来、自由通信等权利。

    根据普遍、平等、直接和秘密的原则来执行选举制度。
    由自由普选选出的国会是国家的最高立法机关。国会将制定全国的新的宪法。确保国会代表们包括国会中的反对派代表的特权。
    由国会赋予职权的政府是国家的最高行政机关并且向国会负责。
    成立联合政府以便加强各政党、各阶层、各民族和越南全国各地之间的团结，同时广泛收集每一个人的好的意见。
    为了照顾两个地区之间的不同情况，每一地区将有权颁布既适合于本地的特点又不违反国家总法律的地方法律。
    在国家没有获得统一的时候，两个地区的负责当局应当让一切赞成和平、统一、独立、民主的党派和人民团体获有合法地位，不得加以歧视。在自由普选中，各个合法政党可共同拟制一个候选人名单或单独竞选。
    四、发展经济和提高生产
    为了医治战争创伤和改善人民的生活，要有计划有步骤地恢复国民经济，把越南从一个经济落后的国家建成一个先进和富强的工业国。
