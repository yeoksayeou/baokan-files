    Highway to Shandan Coal Mine Area Completed
    A highway from Shandan County on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Line to the Shandan Coal Mine area has recently been completed. The Shandan Coal Mine is the first modern coal mine planned to be newly built in Gansu Province after liberation. Now, the construction of this coal mine is about to begin, and mechanical equipment such as boilers, generators, air compressors, winches, and building materials required for the construction are being transported to the mining area successively through this newly built highway. Technical personnel from coal mines in Tongchuan in Shaanxi and Fuxin in Liaoning who are coming to support the construction have also arrived successively. In the future, the Shandan Coal Mine will be mechanized from underground tunneling, coal mining, transportation, ventilation, and drainage to ground transportation, and the equipment needed for these productions is also being transported to the mining area successively.
    After drilling and exploration, it has been confirmed that the reserves of the Shandan coalfield are relatively rich, and the quality of the coal is also good, which is suitable for the needs of railway locomotives. At present, the coal used by railways in Gansu Province is transported from other regions, and the transportation cost of coal is higher than the production cost. After the Shandan Coal Mine is completed, it can supply the coal used by the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in Gansu Province, and the transportation cost of the railway can also be reduced.

    通往山丹煤矿区的公路修成
    从兰新铁路线上的山丹县，最近修好了一条通往山丹煤矿区的公路。山丹煤矿是解放后计划在甘肃省新建的第一个现代化煤矿。现在这个煤矿即将开始施工，施工所需的锅炉、发电机、压风机、绞车等机械设备和建筑材料正通过这条新修的公路，陆续运到矿区。从陕西的铜川、辽宁的阜新等煤矿来支援建设的技术人员也都已陆续到达。山丹煤矿将来从井下的掘进、采煤、运输、通风、排水直到地面上的运输，都将是机械化的，现在这些生产所需的设备也正在陆续运来矿区。
    经过钻探证实，山丹煤田的蕴藏量比较丰富，煤的质量也好，适宜于铁路机车需用。现在甘肃省境内的铁路用煤是由外区运来的，煤的运费比生产成本还高。山丹煤矿建成后，就可以供给甘肃省境内兰新铁路的用煤，铁路的运输成本也可随之降低。（新华社）
