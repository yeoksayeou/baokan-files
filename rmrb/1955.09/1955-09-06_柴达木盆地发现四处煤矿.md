    Four exploitable coal mines have been discovered in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province. Among them, the Wanggaxi Coal Mine has already started coal extraction, supplying the petroleum exploration sites and the state-owned Delingha Farm in the basin.
    The coal quality of these coal mines is very good. After exploitation, it will not only meet the coal demand for petroleum exploration work in the Qaidam Basin, but also supply the local industry and residents of the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture.

    柴达木盆地发现四处煤矿
    青海省柴达木盆地已发现四处可以开采的煤矿。其中旺尕秀煤矿已开始采煤，供应给盆地的石油勘探工地和国营德令哈农场使用。
    这几处煤矿的煤质都很好，开采后不但能够满足柴达木盆地石油勘探工作的用煤需要，并可供应海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州的地方工业和居民使用。
