    Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: Hu Zhaokun, a Shandong Province model for high yields, representing all the youth activists from Shandong and Sichuan provinces attending the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress, proposed a "three types" movement of planting trees, sunflowers, and castor beans to the national youth and children at the afternoon session of the congress on the 24th. They are willing to work with the national youth and children to plant and keep alive an average of one tree per person per year for the next three years; each person to plant enough sunflowers or castor beans to harvest half a jin of seeds per year; and they suggest organizing youth afforestation teams in areas where conditions permit, marching towards large barren hills and wastelands, and advancing along riverbanks. They said in their initiative that some places in Sichuan and Shandong have already achieved results in the "three types" movement. If every youth and child in the country could plant one tree per year, 180 million trees could be planted annually. If each person could harvest half a jin of sunflower and castor bean seeds per year, the country could increase oil production by 90 million jin annually.
    Sun Shigui, the creator of the "fast fire burning method," also representing the six train drivers and assistant firemen attending the congress, proposed another initiative to the national railway youth drivers, assistant drivers, and stokers at the congress – to launch a coal-saving movement, saving 70,000 tons of coal for the country throughout the year. They expressed their willingness to work with all young drivers, assistant drivers, and stokers to do the following well: strictly abide by the train schedule and work plan, actively participate in the 500-kilometer over-axis movement; further study and master the "Luning locomotive maintenance method," and promote the "Latskovsky water discharge method" to maintain locomotives well; strive to learn and flexibly apply advanced operating methods and firing methods to ensure safe driving; strengthen team unity and humbly learn from older workers.
    The initiatives of Hu Zhaokun and Sun Shigui were warmly supported by all the youth activists present at the meeting.
    Today's congress continued with speeches.
    Before the speeches, Zham Su Rong, the head of the Mongolian youth delegation and secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress on behalf of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League and the Mongolian youth, and presented to the congress a purple-red velvet flag embroidered with the words "The Central Committee of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League pays tribute to all Chinese youth building socialism," plaster statues of Mongolian people's leaders Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan, and other gifts. When the head of the Mongolian youth delegation delivered the speech and presented the gifts, the audience applauded, expressing their gratitude. The youth activist representatives present at the meeting also presented flowers to the Mongolian youth delegation.
    A total of twenty-three youth activists spoke at the congress today. Kolesnikov, a member of the Soviet youth delegation and a steelworker from the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union, also spoke at the meeting. Kolesnikov introduced his steelmaking experience. His speech was warmly welcomed by the youth activists present.
