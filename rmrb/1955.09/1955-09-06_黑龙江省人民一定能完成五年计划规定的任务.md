The people of Heilongjiang Province have seen the grand scale of the country's socialist construction and the bright prospects for the province's economic and cultural development from the first Five-Year Plan.

Heilongjiang Province is a newly emerging industrial region and an important agricultural region. In the first Five-Year Plan, it undertakes quite important tasks in industrial capital construction and industrial, agricultural, and forestry production. Many large-scale, modern industrial enterprises of great significance to the country's socialist industrialization are being built or prepared for construction in Heilongjiang Province. The production of various original industrial enterprises in the province will also be greatly increased. By 1957, the province's total industrial output value will increase by 84.2 percent compared to 1952; the proportion of industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value will rise from 46.7 percent in 1952 to 59.35 percent; in the total industrial output value, the proportion of state-owned, local state-owned, and cooperative-operated industries will rise from 82.9 percent in 1952 to 91.66 percent, and the proportion of the production of means of production will rise from 61.6 percent in 1952 to 63.68 percent. These facts show that during the first Five-Year Plan, this province in the northeastern corner of the motherland, once known for its "mountains and fields of soybeans and sorghum," will rapidly develop into a province with a high proportion of industry and a strong socialist heavy industry.

During the first Five-Year Plan, agriculture in Heilongjiang Province will also undergo significant changes. By 1957, the total agricultural output value will increase by 7.09 percent compared to the bumper harvest year of 1952; grain (including potatoes) output will reach 18 billion jin, an increase of 22.8 percent compared to the average annual output of the past five years; organized farmers will reach 95 percent of the total number of farmers; farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives will reach 64.8 percent of the total number of farmers; and state-owned farms will increase from 162 in 1952 to 171. These facts show that by the end of the first Five-Year Plan, Heilongjiang Province will be able to contribute more grain to support national construction, and socialist and semi-socialist agriculture in the province will dominate the entire agricultural economy. This will lay a good foundation for continuing and completing the socialist transformation of agriculture in the second and third Five-Year Plans.

The task given to Heilongjiang Province by the country's first Five-Year Plan is extremely glorious and arduous. In order to fulfill and overfulfill this heavy task, in addition to ensuring that existing enterprises complete and overfulfill the various national plans, it is particularly important to make every effort to ensure the timely completion of the country's key construction projects. To this end, local Party committees and governments must strengthen their leadership and supervision over enterprises, organize relevant forces to provide timely and vigorous support and cooperation, and at the same time vigorously organize and help enterprise cadres and workers improve their management and technical skills. We have done some work in these areas in the past and will redouble our efforts in the future.

Overcoming the contradiction that agricultural development is lagging too far behind industrial development is a major task of the Five-Year Plan. In this regard, we deeply recognize that Heilongjiang Province has vast and fertile land, produces more grain, and has a higher proportion of marketable grain, and therefore bears a particularly important task. In order to better complete this task, first of all, we must implement the central government's policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership" in the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives in our province will account for 47.3 percent of the total number of farmers in 1956 and 64.8 percent in 1957. We are fully confident of completing this target and are prepared to strive to reach 50 percent in 1956 and 70 percent in 1957. At present, from the province and county to the district and village, we are universally promoting the planning for the development of agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural production planning centered on cooperation, and are taking measures to improve the operation and management of agricultural production cooperatives, further implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, and train the backbone of agricultural production cooperatives to consolidate existing agricultural cooperatives and make them universally increase production, and then continue to develop on this basis.

To complete the grain production increase target of the Five-Year Plan, the main measure in Heilongjiang Province is to increase the unit area yield of existing cultivated land. Our province's cultivation is relatively rough, and the potential for increasing production is great. Therefore, it is very important to increase the planting of high-yield crops in a planned way, improve farming techniques, increase the application of manure, select good seeds, build water conservancy projects, and prevent and control disasters.

Heilongjiang Province has nearly 100 million mu of uncultivated fertile land. Reclaiming these wasteland and expanding the cultivated area is an important way to increase agricultural products. Due to limitations in financial and material resources, it is currently not possible to carry out large-scale development; however, it is still possible to reclaim a considerable amount of wasteland by means of farm reclamation, immigrant reclamation, and farmers' local reclamation. Since 1949, we have reclaimed 13.5 million mu of wasteland and organized the settlement of 500,000 people who have moved into rural areas, which has also played a considerable role in increasing grain production. In the next two years or so, we also plan to reclaim 15 million mu of wasteland in order to increase grain production and resettle immigrants from inside and outside the province. In addition, Heilongjiang Province will also complete the survey of 45 million mu of land before 1957 in order to create conditions for larger-scale reclamation in the future.

Heilongjiang Province has a vast land area, fertile soil, abundant water resources, and a climate and rainfall suitable for the production of various crops. Heilongjiang Province has extremely rich forest resources and abundant mineral deposits, and the transportation is also relatively developed. Heilongjiang Province was liberated earlier, and after ten years of work, the masses' awareness and organization have a considerable foundation, and the people's democratic dictatorship is increasingly consolidated. In economic construction, socialist economic components have greatly increased and occupied a dominant position, and some experience in industrial, agricultural and other production and construction has also been accumulated, and we can also regularly receive specific guidance and assistance from Soviet experts. These are all favorable conditions for us to complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan.

The first Five-Year Plan has passed half of its time. By the end of 1954, Heilongjiang Province's total industrial output value had increased by 46.24 percent compared to 1952, an average annual increase of 21 percent (the national plan's average growth rate was 13 percent); in agriculture, although grain output was affected by natural disasters in 1954, it was still close to the average annual output of the five years from 1950 to 1954 (including the particularly bountiful year of 1952). The agricultural cooperation movement has developed rapidly. At present, organized farmers account for more than 90 percent of the total number of farmers, and farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives account for 37.23 percent of the total number of farmers (exceeding the national plan target by 5.77 percent), and there are 19 relatively advanced agricultural production cooperatives. These achievements have further increased our confidence in completing the Five-Year Plan and encouraged us to move forward.

The tasks for the next two years or so are even more arduous. Our experience, technology, and management skills are far from meeting the needs of development. Waste in industrial production and construction is still quite serious. Therefore, we should be modest and prudent in our work, strive to learn, unite and mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in the province, and strive to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the country's first Five-Year Plan.

    黑龙江省人民一定能完成五年计划规定的任务
    中共黑龙江省委第二书记
    黑龙江省省长  韩光
    黑龙江省人民从第一个五年计划中看到了国家社会主义建设的宏伟规模，也看到了本省经济、文化发展的光辉前景。
    黑龙江省是一个新兴的工业地区和重要的农业地区，在第一个五年计划中，在工业基本建设和工业、农业、林业生产等方面，都担负着相当重要的任务。许多对国家社会主义工业化有重要意义的、规模巨大的、现代化的工业企业，正在黑龙江省内兴建或筹建。省内各原有的工业企业的生产也将有很大的提高。至一九五七年，全省工业总产值将比一九五二年增长百分之八十四点二；工业在工农业总产值中的比重，将由一九五二年的百分之四十六点七上升到百分之五十九点三五；在工业总产值中，国营、地方国营和合作社营工业所占比重将由一九五二年的百分之八十二点九上升到百分之九十一点六六，生产资料生产的比重将由一九五二年的百分之六十一点六上升为百分之六十三点六八。这些情况表明，在第一个五年计划期内，祖国东北角的这个曾以“满山遍野的大豆高粱”著称的省份，将迅速发展成为一个拥有较高工业比重，拥有强大的社会主义的重工业的省份。
    第一个五年计划期内，黑龙江省的农业也将有重大的变化。到一九五七年，农业总产值将比大丰收的一九五二年增长百分之七点○九；粮食（包括薯类）产量将达到一百八十亿市斤，比过去五年的平均年产量增长百分之二十二点八；组织起来的农户将达到农户总数的百分之九十五；参加农业生产合作社的农户将达到农户总数的百分之六十四点八；国营农场将由一九五二年的一百六十二处发展到一百七十一处。这些情况表明，到第一个五年计划期末，黑龙江省将可以拿出更多的粮食支援国家建设，省内社会主义和半社会主义的农业将在整个农业经济中占优势。这将为在第二个、第三个五年计划中继续进行和完成农业的社会主义改造奠定良好基础。
    国家的第一个五年计划给予黑龙江省的任务是极其光荣和艰巨的。为了完成和超额完成这个繁重的任务，我们除必须保证现有企业完成和超额完成国家的各种计划以外，特别重要的是必须尽一切努力保证国家各项重点工程建设的按期完成。为此，地方党委、政府必须加强对企业的领导和监督，组织有关各方面力量及时而有力地予以支援和配合，同时大力组织和帮助企业干部、职工提高管理水平和技术水平。在这些方面，我们过去曾进行了一些工作，今后还要加倍努力。
    克服农业发展过分落后于工业发展的矛盾，是五年计划的一个重大任务。在这方面，我们深切地认识到：黑龙江省土地广阔肥沃，产粮较多，商品粮比率较大，因而负有特别重要的任务。为了更好地完成这个任务，首先，就要在发展农业合作化运动中，贯彻中央提出的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针。五年计划规定，我省参加农业生产合作社的农户，一九五六年将占农户总数的百分之四十七点三，一九五七年占百分之六十四点八。我们完全有信心完成这个指标，并准备争取在一九五六年达到百分之五十，一九五七年达到百分之七十。目前，我们从省、县到区、村，正普遍推行发展农业生产合作社的规划和以合作化为中心的农业生产规划，并采取措施改善农业生产合作社的经营管理，进一步贯彻自愿互利政策，训练农业生产合作社的骨干，以巩固现有的农业合作社，使它们普遍增产，然后在这个基础上继续发展。
    要完成五年计划的粮食增产指标，黑龙江省的主要措施是提高现有耕地单位面积产量。我省的耕作较粗糙，增产的潜力很大。因此，有计划地增植高产作物，改进农作技术，增施粪肥，选用良种，兴修水利，防治灾害等是十分重要的。
    黑龙江省有近一亿亩的未开垦的肥沃土地。开垦这些荒地，扩大耕作面积是增加农产品的重要途径。由于财力物力的限制，目前还不可能作很大规模的开发；但采取农场开荒、移民开荒和农民就地开荒等办法开垦相当数量的荒地，仍然是可能的。一九四九年以来，我们已开了一千三百五十万亩荒地，有组织地安插了五十万移入农村的人口，对增产粮食也起了相当作用。在今后的两年多内，我们还准备开荒一千五百万亩，以便增产粮食和安置省内外的移民。此外，黑龙江省还要在一九五七年前，完成四千五百万亩土地的勘测任务，以便为今后更大规模的开荒创造条件。
    黑龙江省土地面积广阔，土质肥沃，水源充足，气候雨量均适于多种作物的生产。黑龙江省有极为富饶的森林资源和丰富的矿藏，交通也比较发达。黑龙江省解放较早，经过十年来的工作，群众的觉悟和组织程度都有相当基础，人民民主专政日益巩固。在经济建设中，社会主义经济成份有很大增长并占了优势，工业、农业等生产建设经验也积累了一些，并且还可以经常得到苏联专家的具体指导和帮助。这些都是我们完成和超额完成五年计划的有利条件。
    第一个五年计划已经过了一半时间，到一九五四年底，黑龙江省工业总产值已比一九五二年提高了百分之四十六点二四，平均每年增长百分之二十一（国家计划平均增长速度为百分之十三）；在农业方面，一九五四年虽受自然灾害影响，但粮食产量仍接近一九五○至一九五四年（其中包括特别丰收的一九五二年）五年的平均年产量。农业合作化运动有迅速的发展，目前组织起来的农户已占农户总数的百分之九十以上，参加农业生产合作社的农户已占农户总数的百分之三十七点二三（超过国家计划指标百分之五点七七），有十九个较高级的农业生产合作社。这些成绩更加提高了我们完成五年计划的信心，鼓舞我们前进。
    今后二年多的任务更为繁重。我们的经验、技术和管理水平都远不能适应发展的需要。在工业生产和建设中的浪费现象还相当严重。因此，我们应当谦虚谨慎地对待自己的工作，努力学习、团结和动员全省各族人民，为保证国家第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成而奋斗。
