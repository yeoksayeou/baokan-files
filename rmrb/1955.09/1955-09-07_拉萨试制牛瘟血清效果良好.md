    Lhasa Trials of Rinderpest Serum Yield Good Results
    The Lhasa Veterinary Disease Prevention Serum Manufacturing Plant has, from mid-June to the present, trial-produced 34,000 cc of rinderpest serum. Injection trials of this serum on artificially infected cattle have proven that it is effective. After 100,000 cc has been trial-produced and a final safety and efficacy test has been carried out, formal production will begin to supply veterinary disease prevention teams and livestock clinics in various regions.
    In order to help the Tibetan people on the Kangzang Plateau develop animal husbandry, the Central People's Government began sending livestock and veterinary experts to Lhasa in December 1952 to help prepare for the establishment of the Lhasa Veterinary Disease Prevention Serum Manufacturing Plant. By June of this year, all 170 rooms of the plant had been built. During the preparation period, experts helped train 72 junior Tibetan veterinary disease prevention technicians. Tibetan interns such as Gesang, Longbu, and Cheng Xiwu, who are now working in the factory, have initially mastered the technology of manufacturing serum and vaccines.
    The Lhasa Veterinary Disease Prevention Serum Manufacturing Plant plans to produce 420,000 cc of rinderpest serum and 60,000 cc of organ vaccines this year.

    拉萨试制牛瘟血清效果良好
    拉萨兽疫防治血清制造厂从六月中旬到现在，已试制出牛瘟血清三万四千西西。这些血清给人工发病的牛进行了注射试验，证明效果良好。待试制出十万西西并进行最后一次安全和效力的检验以后，就开始正式生产，供应各地兽疫防治队和家畜诊疗所使用。
    为帮助康藏高原上藏族人民发展畜牧业，中央人民政府早在一九五二年十二月起就陆续派畜牧和兽医专家到拉萨，帮助筹建拉萨兽疫防治血清制造厂，到今年六月，这个厂的一百七十间房屋全部建立起来。在筹建期间，专家们帮助培养了七十二名藏族兽疫防治的初级技术人员。现在厂里工作的藏族实习生格桑、龙布和程习武等，已能初步掌握制造血清和疫苗的技术。
    拉萨兽疫防治血清制造厂计划在今年内制出牛瘟血清四十二万西西和六万西西的脏器疫苗。
