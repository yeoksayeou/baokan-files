    Economical and Practical Sheds on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway Line
    Jiangxi migrant workers participating in the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway are using a new method to build temporary sheds, with a cost of only 3.72 yuan per square meter, which is 2.28 yuan per square meter lower than the standard cost stipulated by the Ministry of Railways.
    These sheds are entirely built with locally abundant moso bamboo as the roof frame, without a single piece of wood. The roof is covered with straw, and the walls are made of bamboo strips and yellow mud. The doors are also made of bamboo. Each shed is equipped with bamboo lattice windows around the perimeter. The width and height of the sheds are generally around five meters. The interior is bright and spacious, and can be used as offices, dormitories, clinics, and kitchens.
    In the construction of all the sheds, very few metal materials are used. The places where iron wire was originally required are completely replaced with bamboo skin; only a small amount of iron nails are used on the bamboo rafters of the roof.
    Some units are using thatch growing on nearby mountains to replace straw when building temporary sheds, which makes the cost even lower than using straw to cover the roof.
    These sheds have all safely weathered this year's rainy season in the south, and can be used for the winter after pasting paper on the windows.

    鹰厦线上经济适用的工棚
    参加修建鹰厦铁路的江西民工用新的方法修建临时工棚，每平方公尺的造价仅三元七角二分，较铁道部规定的标准造价每平方公尺低二元二角八分。
    这种工棚完全是用当地盛产的毛竹做屋架，没有一根木料，屋面用稻草铺盖，墙身用竹笆、黄泥砌成，门也是用竹料制成，每幢工棚的四周还装置了竹格窗户。工棚的宽度和高度一般都在五公尺左右。室内明亮宽敞，可以做办公室、宿舍、卫生所和厨房等用。
    在全部工棚的建筑中，很少使用五金材料，原需用铁丝的地方完全用竹皮代替；只有屋顶的竹椽上使用少量的铁钉。
    有的单位在修建临时工棚时利用附近山上生长的茅草来代替稻草，造价比使用稻草来铺盖屋顶的临时工棚还可低一些。
    这些工棚都已安全地度过了今年南方的雨季，只要在窗户上糊上纸后，就可以过冬。
