Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 8th: Bulgaria has made great achievements in realizing socialist industrialization.

　　In the eleven years since liberation, Bulgaria has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country with rapidly developing heavy industry. Currently, Bulgaria's total industrial output has nearly increased five and a half times compared to 1939, and the proportion of heavy industry production in the total industrial output value exceeds 40%.

　　The iron and steel industry, which serves as the foundation of heavy industry, has been established. In 1953, the country's first large-scale iron and steel factory, the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Factory, began producing its first batch of domestically produced steel. By 1957, the steel produced by this factory will be able to meet most of the domestic needs. The young Bulgarian machine manufacturing industry can now manufacture 420 new types of machines and equipment, including metal cutting lathes, grain, beet, and cotton harvesters, equipment for the mining, construction, textile, and food industries, and electrical equipment. Since liberation, the production capacity of the power industry has increased 3.6 times compared to pre-liberation 1944, and the total power generation has increased 6.4 times compared to pre-war 1939. During the years of the people's government, Bulgaria's coal mining volume has exceeded the volume mined during the sixty years of bourgeois rule. The mining industry is booming; in 1954, it had increased 28.7 times compared to 1939. The achievements of the emerging chemical industry are also astonishing. It is now able to fully meet domestic needs for nitrogen fertilizer, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, cellulose, pigments, etc. Not long ago, thanks to the discovery of new oil fields by geologists, Bulgaria has also begun to exploit its own oil.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 8th: Bulgaria has achieved remarkable success in carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture in the eleven years since liberation.

　　Currently, over 52% of the country's farmers—approximately 600,000 households—have joined agricultural production cooperatives. The more than 2,700 agricultural production cooperatives that have been established collectively own 61.3% of the country's arable land, supplying the state with over 60% of its commercial grain, 75% of its cotton, 84% of its sugar beets, and large quantities of other technical crops.

　　The technical foundation of agriculture is rapidly expanding. The number of tractors has increased from approximately 4,000 in 1948 to the current 17,000 (each calculated at 15 horsepower). There were no combine harvesters in 1948; now there are more than 2,500. The large increase in agricultural machinery has enabled the mechanization of 55.4% of the basic field work nationwide, and in some areas, the degree of field mechanization has reached 80%.

　　The achievements of agricultural production cooperatives in production are very significant. In 1954, the per unit area yield of wheat in agricultural production cooperatives was 13.1% higher than that of individual farmers, the yield of corn was 26.1% higher, and the yield of cotton was 35% higher.

    保加利亚十一年来工农业获得巨大成就
    新华社八日讯索非亚消息：保加利亚在实现社会主义工业化方面取得了巨大成就。
    在解放以来的十一年中，保加利亚已经由落后的农业国变成一个重工业迅速发展的工业—农业国。目前，保加利亚的工业总产量将近增为一九三九年的五倍半，重工业的生产在工业生产总值中所占比重超过了百分之四十。
    作为重工业基础的钢铁工业已经建立起来，在一九五三年，全国新建的第一座大钢铁工厂——“列宁”国家冶金工厂开始出产了第一批国产钢，到一九五七年这个工厂所生产的钢铁将能满足国内大部分的需要。年轻的保加利亚机器制造业现在已经能制造出四百二十种新的机器和设备，其中包括金属切削车床，谷物、甜菜和棉花收割机，采矿、建筑、纺织和食品工业的设备和电气设备等。解放以来，电力工业的生产能力已经增为解放前一九四四年的三点六倍，总发电量增为战前一九三九年的六点四倍。在人民政权的年代中，保加利亚的采煤量比资产阶级统治时期的六十年还要多。采矿工业正在蓬勃发展，一九五四年它已经增为一九三九年的二十八点七倍。新兴的化学工业发展的成就也是惊人的。它现在已经能够完全满足国内对氮肥、苛性钠、硫酸、纤维素、颜料等的需要。不久以前，由于地质工作者发现了新的石油矿，保加利亚也已经开始开采本国的石油了。
    新华社八日讯索非亚消息：保加利亚解放十一年以来，在实行农业的社会主义改造方面获得了显著的成就。
    目前，占全国农户百分之五十二以上的农户——约六十万的农户都参加了农业生产合作社，已经建立起来的两千七百多个农业生产合作社共拥有全国百分之六十一点三的耕地，它们供应着国家百分之六十以上的商品谷物、百分之七十五的棉花、百分之八十四的甜菜和其他大量的技术作物。
    农业的技术基础正在迅速扩大中。拖拉机从一九四八年的约四千台增加到目前的一万七千台（每台以十五匹马力计算），收割联合机一九四八年一台都没有，现在已经有两千五百多台。农业机器的大量增加使全国农业中百分之五十五点四的基本田间工作都机械化了，有些地区田间机械化的程度并且达到了百分之八十。
    农业生产合作社在生产中的成绩十分显著，一九五四年，农业生产合作社的单位面积的小麦产量比个体农民高百分之十三点一，玉蜀黍产量高百分之二十六点一，棉花产量高百分之三十五。
