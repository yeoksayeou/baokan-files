Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 3rd. The sailors of a certain ship of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy warmly received guests from the Adriatic coast—the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe—on their warship on the 2nd, and held a sea and land get-together with the guests.

That day, the sky was clear and the sea was calm. On the deck, the artists of the song and dance troupe, the sailors of the warship, and the literary and artistic workers of the Chinese troops were chatting intimately in twos and threes, singing and dancing to their heart's content. The members of the song and dance troupe taught the Chinese troops' literary and artistic workers Albanian folk songs such as "You Are So Small and Lovely!" and "Tirana Dance," as well as folk dances. The sailors and the literary and artistic workers of the troops also introduced Chinese songs such as "Spinning Cotton" and "The Second Month is Coming" and basic movements of classical dance to the guests. Everyone used the Chinese and Albanian languages they had just learned to communicate.

In the joint performance program, the sailors performed "Relay Race Dance" and male chorus for the guests, and the guests and the Chinese troops' literary and artistic workers also performed brilliant programs. Albanian folk song "Speak! Speak!" and Chinese song "Victory March," sung by Johan Adanas, a member of the song and dance troupe and winner of the International Competition of the World Youth Festival, were warmly welcomed.

There was also a tug-of-war competition and many games on the deck. As the ship approached the estuary, the sailors also performed combat exercises for the guests.
