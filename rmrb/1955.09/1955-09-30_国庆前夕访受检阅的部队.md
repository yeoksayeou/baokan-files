    On the eve of National Day, I visited the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who will be reviewed on National Day. Many soldiers who came to Beijing for the first time to be reviewed were particularly happy to receive this glorious task. Young soldier Dong Zhanfeng said, "It is the most glorious thing to come to Beijing and be reviewed by Chairman Mao." This rosy-cheeked soldier enlisted this spring in response to the country's call for recruits. In the past, during this season every year, he was harvesting crops in the autumn fields. At that time, he had heard about the National Day parade in Beijing, and he longed for the day when he could become a soldier defending the motherland and be reviewed by Chairman Mao. Now his ideal has been realized. Artillery commander Zhou Zhifa of a certain artillery unit and his comrades have spent the past few years on the border of the motherland during National Day. He had seen the scene of various military branches being reviewed on Tiananmen Square on National Day in pictorials and movies. At that time, he was looking forward to being able to go to Tiananmen Square with his beloved cannon for the review. This time, when he heard that he was coming to Beijing for the review, he happily touched the huge cannon barrel and said, "We are going to Beijing together to be reviewed by Chairman Mao."
    The commanders and combatants participating in the review came to Beijing with excellent results in military training. Zhao Xingyuan, a student from the Military Academy and a famous combat hero, is an outstanding military commander. In the six months since entering the Military Academy, his education level has greatly improved, and now he is working hard to learn the art of commanding modern combined arms operations. Although this battle-hardened commander has led his troops to victory over the enemy time and time again in past battles, he is not satisfied with those past combat experiences at all. At school, he still studies as hard as he considered how to win the battle before each battle in the past. He said to me: "The motherland is advancing. As an officer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I must continue to progress in order to better serve the motherland." After attending the National Congress of Combat Heroes in 1950, he visited the Soviet Union as a youth representative of the People's Liberation Army. He and other representatives were invited to watch the parade in Red Square during the Great October Revolution. Seeing the mighty array of Soviet troops passing neatly through Red Square, he remembered the heroic deeds of the Soviet army in defending the motherland and eliminating the invaders, which strengthened his determination to learn from the Soviet army. This belief has always encouraged him to work hard to study the art of command, so that he has achieved excellent results in every exam.
    During the days of military training, the soldiers studied various combat techniques as seriously as they did in battle. In the hot summer, tankers sat in stuffy tanks and drove over various obstacles to practice driving, shooting and other techniques. Tank driver Suo Junxi, due to his proficiency in driving tanks, his tank won first place in the armored forces driving competition last winter. Sailors from naval schools often take training ships and learn various technical operations on ships in the waves of the sea. Yang Shouyi, a sailor studying marine engineering, studied hard and achieved a score of five in every exam. After graduation, he will be a skilled marine engineer and will work with his comrades to operate warships to defend the motherland on the ocean. Those strong pilots practice formation flying in various complex weather conditions almost day and night. Young pilot Zhang Zhenchang deeply realized the importance of defending the motherland in the air. On the hot summer airport, he often studied various combat actions with his comrades. Whenever the order for take-off training was issued, he concentrated all his energy on driving his beloved war eagle into the sky and practiced flying with other comrades.
    Young soldiers who should be conscripted into military service are even more actively studying and practicing combat skills. Under the guidance of veteran soldiers, new soldier Zhang Fuqi learns shooting techniques on the shooting range every day. During rest time, he studies the principles of shooting. In this way, his shooting results on the range are often five points. New soldier Jin Defeng is a loader on a tank. When he was assigned to the tank unit, he jumped up happily. He thought: Driving a powerful tank can better defend the motherland. During the tense days of training, he and the veteran tankers constantly studied the various technologies and principles of the tank. They often drove the tank over hillsides, swamps and trenches in windy, rainy and hot weather, and practiced loading techniques during rapid shooting while moving up and down. Now he is a skilled tanker.
    The motherland's leap forward in construction greatly encouraged these officers and soldiers. When the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy was announced, they all happily said: The motherland is getting better and better every day. The soldiers who grew up on both sides of the Yellow River talked with particular excitement about the decision in the Five-Year Plan on the comprehensive control and development of the Yellow River. Sun Yujie, a marine engineer in a naval unit, is from Henan Province. His hometown is only seventy or eighty miles away from the Yellow River. He still remembers that one year before he joined the army, the Yellow River flooded and submerged many villages near his hometown. When the first Five-Year Plan was announced, he excitedly said to his comrades: "This is really great news! In the future, the Yellow River will not only be harmless, but will also bring happiness to the people on both sides of the river."
    These officers and soldiers waiting to be reviewed are looking forward to the arrival of National Day with excitement. On this day, they will put on new military uniforms, wear shoulder and collar badges, and pass neatly through Tiananmen Square. They will swear to the people of the motherland: We will certainly defend the motherland's victorious socialist construction and make the people of the motherland happier day by day.

    国庆前夕访受检阅的部队
    新华社记者　路云
    国庆节前夕，记者访问了中国人民解放军在国庆节受检阅的部队。许多第一次来北京受检阅的战士们，对获得这件光荣的任务特别高兴。青年战士董占峰说：“到北京让毛主席检阅，这是最光荣的事情。”这位面孔红润的战士是今年春天响应国家征集补充兵员的号召报名入伍的。过去每年的这个季节，他正在秋收的田野上收割庄稼，那时他曾听说北京国庆节的阅兵情形，他向望着有一天自己也能够当一名保卫祖国的战士，受毛主席的检阅。现在他的理想实现了。某炮兵部队的炮长周志发和他的战友们，过去几年都是在祖国的边疆度过国庆节的。他曾在画报和电影上看到国庆节那天在天安门广场上各兵种受检阅的情形，那时他就盼望着自己也能和心爱的大炮一起到天安门广场受检阅。这次当他听说来北京受检阅，他高兴得摸着那巨大的大炮炮身说：“咱们要一起到北京受毛主席检阅了。”
    参加受检阅的指挥员和战斗员们，都是带着在军事训练中的优秀成绩来到北京的。来自军事学院的学员、著名的战斗英雄赵兴元，是位出色的军事指挥员。他在进入军事学院后的半年时间内，文化程度有了很大的提高，现在他正在刻苦地学习现代化诸兵种合同作战的指挥艺术。这位身经百战的指挥员虽然在过去的战斗中曾一次又一次地带领部队战胜了敌人，但他丝毫也不满足过去那些战斗经验。在学校里，他依然像过去每一次战斗前考虑怎样争取战斗胜利那样的刻苦地钻研功课。他对我说：“祖国在前进，做为中国人民解放军的一个军官，也要不停地进步，才能更好地为祖国服务。”他在一九五零年出席了全国战斗英雄代表会议之后，曾做为解放军的青年代表到苏联进行参观访问。他和其他代表在伟大的十月革命节曾被邀请在红场观礼。他看到在红场上整齐通过的苏军受检阅部队的威武阵容，想起了苏联军队保卫祖国消灭侵略者的英雄事迹，更增强了向苏联军队学习的决心。这种信念一直鼓舞着他努力地钻研指挥艺术，使他在每次考试中都获得优良成绩。
    在军事练兵的日子里，战士们像在战斗时那样认真地学习着各种战斗技术。在炎热的夏天，坦克手们坐在闷热的坦克里驶过各种障碍物练习驾驶、射击等技术。坦克驾驶员索俊玺，由于熟练地掌握了驾驶坦克的本领，在去年冬天参加装甲兵驾驶竞赛时，他所驾驶的坦克获得了第一名。来自海军学校的水兵们，经常乘着教练舰艇，在风浪中的海洋上学习舰艇上的各种技术操作。学习轮机的水兵杨守义由于刻苦钻研，每次考试成绩都是五分。他毕业后将是一名熟练的轮机兵，将和战友们一起操纵着军舰在海洋上保卫祖国。那些健壮的飞行员们，几乎日夜都驾驶着战鹰练习在各种复杂的气象中编队飞行。年青的飞行员张振昌深深地体会到在空中保卫祖国的重要，在炎夏的机场上，经常和战友们一起研究各种战斗动作。每当起飞训练的命令下达后，他便集中一切精力驾驶着心爱的战鹰飞向高空，和其他战友练习飞行。
    应征服兵役的青年战士们，更加积极地苦学苦练着战斗本领。新战士张福岐在老战士的帮助下，每天都在射击场上学习射击技术，休息的时间他就钻研射击的原理，就这样，他在靶场上的射击成绩经常都是五分。新战士金德丰，是坦克车上的装弹手，当他被分配到坦克部队后，他高兴得跳了起来。他想：驾驶着威力巨大的坦克，可以更好地保卫祖国。在紧张练兵的日子里，他和老坦克手们不断地研究坦克上的各种技术和原理，经常在风雨和炎热的天气，乘着坦克驶过山坡、泥沼和壕沟，在起伏前进中练习急速射击时的装弹技术，现在他已是一个熟练的坦克手了。
    祖国在飞跃前进的建设事业，大大鼓舞着这些指战员们。当发展国民经济的第一个五年计划公布后，他们都欢乐地说：祖国一天天地美好起来了。生长在黄河两岸的战士都特别兴奋地谈论着五年计划中关于根治和综合开发黄河的决定。海军某部轮机兵孙玉杰是河南省人，他的家乡离黄河只七、八十里路，他还记得参军前有一年黄河泛滥成灾，淹没了他家乡附近的许多村庄。当第一个五年计划公布后，他兴奋地对战友们说：“这真是大喜事！将来黄河不但没有害，而且还会给沿河两岸的人民带来幸福。”
    这些待命受检阅的指战员们，正怀着兴奋的心情盼望着国庆节的到来。这一天，他们将穿上新的军装，带上肩章和领章，整齐地通过天安门广场。他们将向祖国人民宣誓：我们一定保卫祖国胜利地进行社会主义建设，让祖国人民一天比一天幸福。
