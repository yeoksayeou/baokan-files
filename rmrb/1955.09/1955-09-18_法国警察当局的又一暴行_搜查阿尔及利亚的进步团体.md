Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 16th: Following the French government's announcement of the dissolution of the Algerian Communist Party, the French police authorities in Algeria have launched a large-scale search of Algerian progressive groups. On the 14th, the French authorities in Algeria searched approximately 200 houses. The headquarters of progressive organizations such as the Algeria-Soviet Friendship Association, the Algerian Women's League, and the Algerian Democratic Youth League were all searched, and documents and archives were confiscated.

The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué, strongly protesting the French government's ban on the Algerian Communist Party. The Executive Bureau called on all trade union organizations and French workers to rise up against the "violent policies" in Algeria, which undermine the national interests of France and violate the interests of the Algerian people.

    法国警察当局的又一暴行
    搜查阿尔及利亚的进步团体
    新华社十六日讯  巴黎消息：阿尔及利亚的法国警察当局在法国政府宣布解散阿尔及利亚共产党后，大举搜查阿尔及利亚进步团体。十四日，阿尔及利亚法国当局搜查了约二百所房屋，阿尔及利亚——苏联友好协会、阿尔及利亚妇女联盟、阿尔及利亚民主青年联盟等进步组织的总部都被搜查，文件和档案被没收。
    法国总工会执行局发表公报，猛烈抗议法国政府禁止阿尔及利亚共产党。执行局号召所有工会组织和法国工人起来反对在阿尔及利亚的“暴力政策”，这种政策损害法国的民族利益，并且违反阿尔及利亚人民的利益。
