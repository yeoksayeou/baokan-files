    Congratulations on the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Telegram to Comrade Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; Comrade Ton Duc Thang, Acting Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; Comrade Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, from Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai:
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we, on behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have waged heroic and arduous struggles against colonialist aggression and for peace, unification, independence, and democracy, and have achieved significant victories. These victories have not only inspired all peoples struggling for national independence and freedom, but have also made significant contributions to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people feel boundless joy and admiration for this.
    The 1954 Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina and achieving the unification of Vietnam through national elections, but currently, the enemies of peace are plotting to sabotage the implementation of the Geneva Agreements, which is absolutely intolerable to all righteous people. The Chinese people give great sympathy and support to the continuous efforts made by the Vietnamese people to strive for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Agreements and to convene consultative conferences between the North and the South to prepare for national free elections.
    We wish the Vietnamese people greater victories in the struggle for peace, independence, unification, and democracy!
    We wish you further achievements in consolidating the democratic regime, healing the wounds of war, and restoring and developing the national economy!

        Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
        Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
        Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
                                September 1, 1955, in Beijing

    祝贺越南民主共和国成立十周年
    毛泽东主席刘少奇委员长周恩来总理电越南民主共和国主席胡志明同志：越南民主共和国国民大会常务委员会代理主席孙德胜同志：越南民主共和国副总理兼外交部长范文同同志：
    值此越南民主共和国成立十周年之际，我们谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向你们，并通过你们向越南民主共和国政府和人民致衷心的、热烈的祝贺。
    十年来，越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，为反对殖民主义侵略和争取和平、统一、独立和民主进行了英勇和艰苦的斗争，并获得了重大的胜利。这些胜利不但鼓舞了一切为民族独立和自由而斗争的人民，并且对保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业做出了重大的贡献。中国人民对此感到无限的欢欣和敬佩。
    一九五四年日内瓦会议达成了恢复印度支那和平和通过全国选举实现越南统一的协议，但目前和平的敌人却又在阴谋破坏日内瓦协议的实施，这是一切正义的人们所绝对不能容许的。中国人民对越南人民为争取彻底实现日内瓦协议、召开南北双方协商会议以准备全国自由选举所作的不断努力，给予极大的同情和支持。
    祝越南人民在为争取和平、独立、统一和民主的斗争中获得更大的胜利！
    祝你们在巩固民主政权、医治战争创伤并恢复和发展国民经济的事业中获得进一步的成就！	中　华　人　民　共　和　国　主　席　毛泽东	中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长　刘少奇	中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长　周恩来
                                一九五五年九月一日于北京
