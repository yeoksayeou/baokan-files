    Why Give So Many Calendars

    To the Editor:

    In recent years, our organization has consistently received a large number of calendars and monthly calendars from certain units every time a new year is approaching. The quantity of these gifts not only increases year by year, but also the quality improves year by year. For example, at the end of last year, we received 1955 calendars or monthly calendars from supply and marketing management organizations affiliated to the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Wuhan Municipal Industrial Bureau, the Chengdu Municipal Industrial Bureau, department stores in various regions, and magazines such as "Study," "New Sports," and "Sino-Soviet Friendship." As a result, some offices in our organization have two or three calendars hanging on the wall, and each desk has a monthly calendar under the glass, while some of the poorly printed ones are simply thrown away.

    I think that giving calendars is not necessarily wrong. However, some units give too many calendars. For example, the Supply and Marketing General Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry distributes calendars to department stores, cooperatives, and other units in various counties and cities; the Manager's Office of the Wuhan Municipal Industrial Bureau sent ten calendars to our organization alone.

    Currently, some units may be preparing to print calendars as gifts again. I hope that these units will adhere to the spirit of thrift and refrain from sending or reduce the number of calendars sent, in order to save state funds.

### 为什么要赠送这么多日历

    为什么要赠送这么多日历编辑同志：
    近年来，我们机关在每一个新年快要来到的时候，总要收到某些单位赠送的不少日历和月份牌。这种礼物不仅数量一年比一年多，而且质量也一年比一年好。像去年年末我们就收到了第一机械工业部、轻工业部、武汉市工业局、成都市工业局等单位所属供销管理机构，各地百货公司，以及学习、新体育、中苏友好等杂志社所送的一九五五年的日历或月份牌。因此，我们机关的有些办公室墙上就挂上了两三份日历，每一个办公桌的玻璃板下也都放着月份牌，一些印制稍差的就干脆被扔掉了。
    我觉得，赠送日历并非一定不可以。但是有的单位赠送的日历的确太多了。如轻工业部供销总局把日历普遍分送给各县、市的百货公司、合作社等单位；武汉市工业局经理室赠送的日历，仅仅我们机关就收到十份。
    目前，有的单位可能又在准备印制日历当礼物了。我希望这些单位本着节约的精神，不送或少送日历，以便节约国家资金。
