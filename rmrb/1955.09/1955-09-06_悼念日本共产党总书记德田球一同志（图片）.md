In Memoriam: Comrade Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party

Tokuda Kyuichi (1894-1953) was the glorious son of the Japanese people. He dedicated his life to the cause of the liberation of the Japanese people. His death is a great loss to the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people. The Chinese people express their deep condolences on his death.

Tokuda Kyuichi was one of the founders of the Japanese Communist Party. He was elected as a member of the Central Committee at the first party congress on July 15, 1922. In 1928, Tokuda Kyuichi was arrested and fought in prison for 18 years, until his release after Japan's surrender in 1945. At the Fourth Congress of the Japanese Communist Party in December 1945, Tokuda Kyuichi was honorably elected as a member of the Central Committee and General Secretary of the Party. After the war, the Japanese Communist Party led the Japanese people in a resolute struggle against the American occupation and for Japan's peace, independence, and freedom, and was therefore subjected to cruel persecution by the US-Japan reactionaries. On the eve of the United States' launch of the Korean War, the US occupation authorities in Japan illegally "purged" all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, headed by Tokuda Kyuichi, on June 6, 1950. However, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Tokuda Kyuichi, the Japanese Communist Party has consistently adhered to the struggle to defend the interests of the Japanese nation.

    From an early age, Tokuda Kyuichi cultivated the habit of loving reading. He assiduously studied the classic works of Marxism-Leninism and read general books. The picture shows Tokuda Kyuichi concentrating on reading.

    Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, headed by Tokuda Kyuichi, the Japanese people have consistently adhered to the struggle against the American occupation and to defend the interests of the Japanese people after the war. In July 1955, 30,000 people in Tokyo, Japan, held a rally to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party. The picture shows a corner of the rally venue.

    After the Japanese Communist Party announced the news of Tokuda Kyuichi's death, the Japanese people went to the Central Headquarters of the Japanese Communist Party (in Tokyo) to offer condolences and pay their respects before Tokuda Kyuichi's portrait.

    Shiga Yoshio, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, solemnly announced the news of the death of Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, in Beijing due to illness, at the closing meeting of the Sixth National Congress of the Japanese Communist Party.

    On the afternoon of August 10, 1955, a memorial service for Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, was held at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo. Approximately 3,000 people attended the memorial service. The picture shows the memorial service venue.

    悼念日本共产党总书记德田球一同志
    德田球一（一八九四——一九五三）是日本人民光荣的儿子，他把自己的一生献给了日本人民的解放事业。他的逝世，是日本共产党和日本人民极大的损失。中国人民对他的逝世表示沉痛的悼念。
    德田球一是日本共产党的创始人之一。他在一九二二年七月十五日第一次党大会上当选为中央委员会委员。一九二八年，德田球一被捕，他在狱中进行了十八年的斗争，直到一九四五年日本投降后才出狱。一九四五年十二月，日本共产党举行第四次代表大会时，德田球一光荣地当选为中央委员和党的总书记。日本共产党在战后领导日本人民为反对美国占领和争取日本的和平、独立、自由，进行坚决的斗争，因此受到美日反动派残酷的迫害。在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争的前夕，驻日美国占领军当局竟在一九五○年六月六日非法“整肃”以德田球一为首的日本共产党全体中央委员。但是日本共产党在以德田球一为首的中央委员会的领导下，一直坚持着为捍卫日本民族利益而进行的斗争。
