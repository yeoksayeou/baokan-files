More than 1,300 Chinese military artists and Beijing youth artists gathered at the station to warmly welcome their arrival.

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the station. The welcome venue was decorated with the national flags of China and Poland, and portraits of the leaders of the Chinese and Polish people, Mao Zedong and Bolesław Bierut, hung on the green curtain. Standing in the center of the venue with Lieutenant Colonel Wolwa, Colonel Ratkowski, and Colonel Ruda were Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Xia Yan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China; He Wei, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs; Xiao Xiangrong, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense; Liu Zhijian, Director of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Chen Yi, Minister of Culture; Chen Zhongjing, Acting Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations; Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; Yang Chengwu, Commander of the Beijing-Tianjin Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; and Kiryluk, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China. During the welcome ceremony, thunderous applause erupted from the crowd, and artists from China and Poland chanted "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Long live Bierut" together.

Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Xia Yan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, delivered welcome speeches on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese literary and art circles. Chen Yi said: The heroic Polish army, since the establishment of the First Division named after the people's hero Kościuszko, has fought side by side with the Soviet army, tempered and strengthened itself in the war, liberated the beautiful Polish territory, and marched into Berlin with the Soviet army. Now, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and Marshal Rokossovsky, the Polish army has become a modernized and invincible people's army. We thank the Polish government and people for sending the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble to our country, so that the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and its artists have once again gained the opportunity to learn from you. In his speech, Xia Yan pointed out that the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble comes from a country with a glorious and splendid cultural tradition, from the country that gave birth to Copernicus, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Mickiewicz, and Chopin. They have brought the beautiful art of the Polish people and will be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and cultural and artistic circles.

In his reply, Lieutenant Colonel Wolwa, on behalf of the Polish army and the Polish people, extended a soldier's salute to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army and expressed the hope that this visit to China by the song and dance ensemble will further consolidate the fighting fraternal friendship between the Polish army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

That evening, the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble attended a welcome party and watched a performance by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Ensemble.

The Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble arrived in Manzhouli City on the 19th, where they were warmly welcomed by a representative of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a representative of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, and more than 300 people from all walks of life in Manzhouli City.
