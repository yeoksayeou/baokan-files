Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 26th: Former United Nations Belgian soldier, Rogier Devriendt, arrived in Shenzhen from Guangzhou this afternoon, September 26th. China Red Cross worker, Ma Wen, handed him over to Mrs. Strathie, a worker from the British Red Cross Hong Kong branch. The handover was completed at 1:00 PM, after which Devriendt was led away from Shenzhen to Hong Kong by Mrs. Strathie.

Devriendt crossed the Korean Military Demarcation Line on July 31, 1953, and requested to reside in China. With the approval of the competent Chinese authorities upon application by the Chinese Red Cross on his behalf, he came to China in February 1954. In June of this year, Devriendt applied to go to the United States, but later changed his mind and applied to return to Belgium. The relevant Chinese authorities agreed to his application, and after the Chinese Red Cross made appropriate arrangements with the Indian Red Cross and other relevant parties on his behalf, the Chinese Red Cross sent someone to accompany him to Shenzhen.

    前联合国军一比籍士兵出境
    新华社广州二十六日电　前联合国军比利时籍士兵罗歇·德夫里安已于二十六日下午从广州到达深圳，由中国红十字会工作人员马文将他交给英国红十字会香港分会的工作人员司特拉西夫人。双方在下午一时交接完毕后，德夫里安即由司特拉西夫人带领离深圳去香港。
    德夫里安是一九五三年七月三十一日越过朝鲜军事分界线并请求来中国居住，经中国红十字会代向中国主管当局申请获得批准，于一九五四年二月来到中国。今年六月，德夫里安曾提出申请到美国去，后又改变主意申请返回比利时，中国有关方面同意他的申请，并由中国红十字会代向印度红十字会等有关方面接洽妥当后，即由中国红十字会派人陪送到深圳。
