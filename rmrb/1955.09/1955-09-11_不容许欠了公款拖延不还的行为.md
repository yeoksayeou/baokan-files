    Tolerating the Behavior of Delaying Repayment of Public Funds is Not Allowed

    Editor:
    On June 23 this year, Luo Pu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Third Engineering Office of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, was talking with a staff member named Wang Hui sent by the company. Suddenly, Luo Pu flew into a rage, jumping up and down, slapping the table, glaring, and cursing loudly.
    What was going on?
    It turned out that, in the second quarter of this year, the Northeast First Engineering Company, in accordance with the spirit of opposing waste and practicing economy, cleared up the debts of its employees. Luo Pu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Third Engineering Office, owed 150 yuan of public funds when he was transferred from the Northeast First Engineering Company and had not repaid it. Therefore, the company sent Wang Hui to ask him to return the owed public funds.
    Who knew that as soon as Wang Hui explained her purpose, this Party Branch Secretary flatly denied it: "Who said I owe money? I have never borrowed money." Then, he said decisively: "I don't owe a penny! Not even half a penny!"
    Wang Hui was stunned. Perhaps, because the Party Branch Secretary was too busy with work, he forgot about the private debt of public funds! Therefore, she patiently explained the date and items of Secretary Luo Pu's debt, and at the same time handed him the debt list under Secretary Luo's name that she had brought with her.
    This time, Secretary Luo got really angry. He slammed the table so loudly that it shook the heavens, glared his eyes, and roared: "Who do you represent? If you represent the company to ask for money, you are extorting people! If you represent an individual, get out of here!" He seemed to hate the debt list that Wang Hui handed him, and threw it away without even looking at it. The list floated to the ground like fallen leaves.
    "Secretary Luo, please think about it again..." Wang Hui still calmly asked him to reconsider. However, before she could finish speaking, Secretary Luo scolded again menacingly: "Get out of here, whether you represent the company or an individual, get out of here. If you have the ability, sue me to the company? I am not even afraid of the manager!..."
    Wang Hui came out after being scolded. However, the employee's debt must be recovered, so she notified the company to send someone again to send all of Secretary Luo's IOU and original payment vouchers to the Third Engineering Office for verification. After checking them one by one, it was found that among the six IOUs, except for the IOU of 30 yuan for purchasing a coat with travel expenses when Luo Pu went to Beijing to visit the Soviet Exhibition in November of last year, which was signed by the company secretary on his behalf, the rest had his own seal. The truth has come to light, and in principle, Secretary Luo should admit his mistake. Unexpectedly, this Party Branch Secretary refused to bow his head even in the face of ironclad facts. He still refused to sign and unreasonably said: "I can't go through the formalities now, I will go to the company later."
    Wang Hui was really helpless and could only admit that her "ability" was limited and returned to the company.
    After Luo Pu sent Wang Hui away, he notified the administrative section chief of the company, saying that the 70 yuan borrowed from the Heilongjiang Provincial Engineering Company in the past should be "handled separately" because the time had passed for a long time. In other words, "This money of the state has been used by me for so long, so I don't need to pay it back." Everyone, look, what a strange logic this is.
    State funds must not be stolen by anyone! Communist Party members, especially the leaders of a Party organization, only have the obligation to protect state property in an exemplary manner, and have no right to borrow money and not repay it. The Party Committee of the First Engineering Company should investigate and deal with this incident.

### 不容许欠了公款拖延不还的行为

    不容许欠了公款拖延不还的行为编辑同志：
    今年六月二十三日，建筑工程部东北第一工程公司齐齐哈尔第三工程处的党总支书记罗普，同公司派来的一个叫王辉的工作人员正在谈话，突然间，罗普怒气冲天，暴跳如雷，拍桌子瞪眼地破口大骂起来。
    这是怎么一回事呢？
    原来，今年第二季度东北第一工程公司根据反对浪费、厉行节约的精神，清理了职工的欠款。第三工程处党总支书记罗普在调离东北第一工程公司时欠了公款一百五十元没有还，所以公司派了王辉来要他归还所欠的公款。
    谁知道，王辉刚讲明来意，这位党总支书记就矢口否认：“谁说我欠款，我向来没借过钱。”接着，又斩钉截铁地说：“我一分钱不欠！半分钱也不欠！”
    王辉呆住了。也许，因为党总支书记工作太忙，把私人欠公款的事忘掉了吧！于是，她耐心地说明罗普书记欠款的日期和项目，同时将带来的罗书记名下的欠款清单交给他看。
    这一下，罗书记可火了。他把桌子拍得震天响，瞪着眼睛大吼：“你代表谁来的？你如果代表公司来要钱的，就是讹人来啦！你如果代表个人来的，就给我滚出去！”他似乎恨透了王辉交给他的欠款清单，拿过来看也不看就用力一扔。清单像落叶一样飘散在地上。
    “罗书记，你再想一下……”王辉还是冷静地要求他再考虑一下。可是，不等她把话说完，罗书记又气势汹汹地骂道：“你给我滚出去，不论你是代表公司，还是代表个人，全给我滚出去。你有本领向公司告我？就是经理我也不怕！……。”
    王辉挨了一顿骂出来了。但是，职工欠款不能不收还，她又通知公司再派人将罗书记的借据和缴款的原始凭证全部送到第三工程处对证。经过一笔一笔地核对后，在六张借据中，除在去年十一月二十九日罗普去北京参观苏联展览馆的时候，动用旅费购买大衣的借据三十元由公司秘书代签外，其余的都有他本人盖的章。真相已经大白，按理说罗书记总应该承认错误了。不料，这位党总支书记居然在铁的事实面前也是不肯低头的，他仍然拒绝签证，并且无理地说：“现在我不能办理手续，以后到公司去再说。”
    王辉实在无可奈何，只能自认“本领”有限，返回公司。
    罗普在把王辉打发走以后，就通知公司行政科科长，说是欠款中过去在黑龙江省工程公司所借的七十元，因时间过去很久，要求“另行处理”。换句话说就是，“这笔国家的钱被我用了那么久，就不必还了”。大家看，这是多奇怪的逻辑。
    国家资金决不允许被任何人窃取！共产党员，特别是一个党组织的领导人员，只有模范地爱护国家财产的义务，而决没有借款不还的权利。对于这一事件，第一工程公司的党委应该进行检查、处理。
