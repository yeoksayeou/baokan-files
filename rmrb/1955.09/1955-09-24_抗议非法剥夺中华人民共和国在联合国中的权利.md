    At the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States and the countries that follow it, using a formal "majority," forcibly made the Assembly pass the absurd proposal that the current session "not consider the issue of the representation of China in the United Nations." The Chinese people express serious protest against the US government and its followers for continuing to obstruct the restoration of the legitimate status and rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    China is one of the founders of the United Nations. The Chinese people established indelible merit in the anti-fascist war. After the war, in order to establish and consolidate lasting world peace, the Chinese people made significant contributions to the creation of the United Nations organization. The 600 million Chinese people enjoy inalienable and inviolable rights in the United Nations, which no one can deny.
    In 1949, after a long period of struggle, the Chinese people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. Six hundred million people, according to their own will, chose a people's democratic state system and established the great People's Republic of China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai immediately requested the United Nations to expel the Chiang Kai-shek clique, a small group of fugitives in Taiwan under the protection of foreign forces, and to accept the representatives of the People's Republic of China. However, under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations has refused this just demand year after year, and until today, still excludes the People's Republic of China from the United Nations organization. This extremely unfair and unreasonable situation seriously infringes upon the undeniable legitimate rights of the Chinese people, tramples on the United Nations Charter, and completely violates the interests of world peace and security. Because the legitimate rights of the Chinese people have been unreasonably deprived, the United Nations has not only greatly reduced its own prestige and status, but has also been subjected to increasing condemnation from more and more countries and people. The universality of the United Nations as a world organization and its role as a tool for maintaining and strengthening world peace have been greatly damaged.
    The facts of the past six years have eloquently proved that the People's Republic of China, as one of the world's major powers, is an important force for consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people are making every effort to ease international tensions and strengthen trust and cooperation between countries. It is well known that it was due to the active initiative of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that the cessation of the Korean War became possible. At the Geneva Conference in 1954, the People's Republic of China, together with the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, made great contributions to the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, thereby eliminating another center of war in Asia. The People's Republic of China, in accordance with its consistent peaceful policy, participated in the Asian-African Conference, actively promoted international cooperation, and played a major role in the success of the conference. The People's Republic of China strives to establish harmonious relations with its neighbors. The Five Principles advocated by China, India, and Burma—principles that have been recognized by many countries in Asia and Europe—set a good example for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.
    China's peaceful policy is fully in line with the United Nations Charter. This policy's contribution to world peace has been recognized by all just people. World public opinion recognizes that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is fundamentally impossible to solve major international problems. People cannot imagine that, in excluding the People's Republic of China, a worldwide agreement can be reached on the issue of achieving universal disarmament and prohibiting the use of atomic weapons. People cannot imagine that further resolution of the Korean issue can be achieved under such circumstances. And these major issues are precisely what the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly is going to discuss.
    The Tenth UN General Assembly is being held after the Geneva Four-Power Summit. Recently, the Soviet Union, China, and all peace-loving countries have made a series of efforts to improve the international atmosphere and build trust between countries. International opinion generally believes that in order to further ease the current international situation, it is necessary to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and expel the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who are despised by 600 million Chinese people, from this international organization. This reasonable proposition represents the good wishes of millions upon millions of people around the world. If the United States and its followers are not afraid of the easing of the international situation, and if they do not want to continue playing the "Cold War" policy, they could not possibly want to continue illegally depriving the People's Republic of China of its undeniable rights in the United Nations. Their actions are clearly a blatant violation of the Geneva spirit created by the Four-Power Summit.
    The reason why the United States stubbornly refuses to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is known to everyone. It is not satisfied with the Chinese people overthrowing the corrupt Chiang Kai-shek regime, which was supported by the United States and served the interests of American imperialism; it is even less satisfied with the Chinese people choosing their own people's democratic system. For several years, it has tried to interfere with and undermine the wise choice made by the Chinese people. Until now, it is still interfering in China's internal affairs and obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. This hegemonic policy of the United States in international affairs seriously violates the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. This policy should be condemned by the United Nations General Assembly.
    It should be pointed out that today's social system in China is a voluntary choice of 600 million people; no external force can prevent the Chinese people from moving towards the goal of socialism. The People's Republic of China has established diplomatic relations with more than twenty countries with a population of more than one billion, and has established transactional relations with dozens of countries. The existence of New China is an unchangeable fact. Those who are unwilling to face the historical changes that have taken place on the Chinese mainland, and who are unwilling to recognize the fact that 600 million people have appeared on the world stage, can only create more difficulties for themselves and make themselves increasingly isolated.
    In order to defend the United States' arrogant behavior of discriminating against the Chinese people, some Western powers that echoed its claims even claimed that in order to avoid causing controversy and maintain the "unity" of the United Nations, they agreed to postpone consideration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in this organization. Some countries that verbally stated that they wanted to establish normal or even friendly relations with China also echoed this argument and adopted a position of following the United States. However, the facts are clearly before them: the United Nations, by excluding the People's Republic of China, which has 600 million people, is excluding a quarter of the world's population. It is precisely because of this that many peace-loving countries that care about the United Nations have expressed great dissatisfaction with this situation. It should be said that maintaining this situation will only harm the unity of the United Nations, not maintain the unity of the United Nations. If these countries want to use the fictitious reason of maintaining the "unity" of the United Nations to cover up their unfriendly attitude towards the People's Republic of China, it will be of no use at all.
    No force in the world can change the fact of the existence and development of the People's Republic of China. The legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored. The act of depriving the Chinese people of this right is bound to fail. The People's Republic of China will certainly play an increasingly important role in international affairs, and no force can stop this.

### 抗议非法剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利

    抗议非法剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利
    在联合国大会的第十届会议上，美国和追随它的国家，以形式上的“多数”，强使大会通过了本届会议“不考虑关于中国在联合国中的代表权的问题”的荒谬提案。中国人民对于美国政府及其追随者继续阻挠中华人民共和国恢复在联合国中的合法地位和权利的行为，表示严重的抗议。
    中国是联合国的创始者之一。中国人民在反法西斯战争中，树立了不可磨灭的功绩。战后，为了建立并巩固世界持久和平，中国人民对于联合国组织的缔造，又作了重大的贡献。六亿中国人民在联合国中享有不能侵犯、不容剥夺的权利，这是任何人不能否认的。
    一九四九年，中国人民在经过了长期的斗争以后，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治。六亿人民根据自己的意志，选择了人民民主的国家制度，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国成立以后，我国总理兼外交部长周恩来即要求联合国把那一小撮逃亡在台湾的、受外来势力庇护的蒋介石集团的“代表”驱逐出去，而接纳中华人民共和国的代表。但是，联合国在美国的操纵之下，年复一年地拒绝这一正义要求，直到今天，仍然把中华人民共和国排斥在联合国组织之外。这种极不公正和极不合理的状况，严重地侵害了中国人民无可抹煞的合法权利，蹂躏了联合国宪章，并且完全违背了世界和平和安全的利益。由于中国人民的合法权利被无理剥夺，联合国不但大大降低了它自己的威信和地位，并且使它自己受到了越来越多的国家和人民的斥责。联合国作为世界组织的普遍性和它作为维护和加强世界和平的工具的作用，已经受到了极大的损害。
    六年来的事实雄辩地证明，作为世界大国之一的中华人民共和国，是巩固亚洲和平和世界和平的重要力量。中国人民竭尽一切努力来和缓国际紧张局势，加强国与国之间的信任和合作。尽人皆知，由于中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的积极主动，才使朝鲜战争的停止成为可能。在一九五四年日内瓦会议上，中华人民共和国又同苏联及越南民主共和国一起，对和平解决印度支那问题作出了巨大的贡献，因而消除了亚洲的另一个战争中心。中华人民共和国本着一贯的和平政策，参加亚非会议，积极促进国际合作，对会议的成功起了重大作用。中华人民共和国努力谋求同它的邻国建立和睦的关系。中国和印度、缅甸所倡导的五项原则——这些原则已为亚洲和欧洲许多国家所确认——为不同社会制度国家的和平共处树立了良好的榜样。
    中国的和平政策完全符合于联合国宪章。这个政策对世界和平的贡献已经为一切正义人类所公认。世界舆论承认，没有中华人民共和国的参加，要想解决国际间的重大问题，是根本不可能的。人们不能设想，在排斥中华人民共和国的情况下，竟可以在实现全世界的普遍裁军、禁止使用原子武器的问题上达成世界性的协议。人们更不能设想，在这样的情况下可以求得朝鲜问题的进一步解决。而这些重大的问题，正是联合国大会的第十届会议所要讨论的。
    十届联大是在日内瓦四国首脑会议之后举行的。最近以来，苏联、中国和所有爱好和平的国家，为改善国际气氛、建立国与国之间的信任，作了一系列的努力。各国舆论普遍地认为，要进一步和缓目前的国际局势，就必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，把为六亿中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团的“代表”，从这个国际组织中驱逐出去。这一合理的主张，代表了全世界千千万万人民的善良愿望。美国及其追随者如果不是害怕国际局势的缓和，如果不是想继续玩弄“冷战”政策，就不能设想要继续非法剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中不可抹煞的权利。它们的这种行为显然是对四国首脑会议所创造的日内瓦精神的公然违反。
    美国死硬地拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，其理由人人都知道。它不满意中国人民推翻了美国所扶植的、为美帝国主义的利益而服务的蒋介石腐烂政权，它更不满意中国人民选择自己的人民民主制度。几年以来，它力图干涉和破坏中国人民所作的英明选择。直到现在，它还在干涉中国内政，阻挠中国人民解放台湾。美国在国际事务中这种专横霸道的政策严重地违反了联合国宪章的原则和宗旨。这种政策应该受到联合国大会的谴责。
    应该指出，中国今天的社会制度，是六亿人民自愿选择的；任何一种外来力量，都不可能阻止中国人民向社会主义的目标迈进。中华人民共和国已经和拥有十亿以上人口的二十多个国家建立了外交关系，和几十个国家建立了事务性的关系。新中国的存在，是无可改变的事实。那些不愿意正视在中国大陆上发生的历史性的变化，不愿意承认六亿人口出现在世界舞台上的这一事实的人们，只能由此为他们自己制造更多的困难，使他们自己越来越孤立。
    为了替美国这种歧视中国人民的专横行为进行辩护，某些附和它的主张的西方大国，竟然诡称为了避免引起争论保持联合国的“团结”，同意推迟考虑中华人民共和国在这个组织中的合法地位。有些口口声声说要同中国建立正常甚至友好关系的国家也附和这种论调，采取了追随美国的立场。但是，事实明显地摆在他们面前，联合国排斥了拥有六亿人民的中华人民共和国，就是排斥了四分之一的世界人类。正是因为这样，所以许多爱好和平、关心联合国的国家，都对这种情况表示极大的不满。应该说，保持这种情况，就只有损害联合国的团结，而不是保持联合国的团结。如果这些国家想用保持联合国的“团结”这种虚构的理由来掩饰它们对中华人民共和国不友好的态度，那是一点用处也没有的。
    世界上没有什么力量可以改变中华人民共和国的存在和发展的事实。中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利是一定要恢复的。剥夺中国人民这种权利的行为是一定要失败的。中华人民共和国一定要在国际事务中起越来越大的作用，这是任何势力都不能阻挡的。
