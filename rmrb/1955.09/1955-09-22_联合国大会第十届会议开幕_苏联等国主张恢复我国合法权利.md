Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 21st: The tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly opened at 15:15 local New York time on September 20th at the United Nations Headquarters.

    The delegations of all sixty member states of the United Nations gathered in the General Assembly Hall. The head of the Soviet delegation attending the meeting was Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the head of the American delegation was Secretary of State Dulles, the head of the British delegation was Foreign Secretary Macmillan, and the head of the French delegation was Foreign Minister Pinay.

    The head of the Dutch delegation, Foreign Minister Luns, presided as chairman, replacing the absent chairman of the ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly, Van Kleffens.

    In his opening remarks, Luns said that this session was beginning its work in a new international environment. Luns particularly pointed out the role of the Geneva Four-Power Summit in easing international tensions. Luns said that in the new international environment, he did not regard the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly as a meeting of a large number of people representing various countries, ideologies, and interests. He said, "I believe that we represent a world united under the common goal of striving for peace, security, and progress for all mankind."

    Luns said that this year we have every reason to be more confident than ever before that the United Nations, in this improved atmosphere, will become a more effective and more important organization.

    Soviet delegation head Molotov then spoke on the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. He submitted a proposal to the General Assembly. The proposal stated: "The General Assembly decides that the representatives appointed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China are the representatives of China in the United Nations General Assembly and other United Nations agencies." Molotov requested the General Assembly to adopt this proposal.

    American representative Lodge spoke against Molotov's proposal. Lodge put forward a proposal suggesting that the United Nations General Assembly not consider the issue of China's representation in the United Nations at this session.

    The General Assembly representatives then spoke on the Soviet and American proposals.

    British representative Nutting spoke in support of the American proposal. Nutting said that the British government believes that "the issue of China's representation in the United Nations is one of those issues that must be resolved before normal peaceful relations can be re-established in the Far East." However, he also said that "debating this highly contentious issue does more harm than good," and that the British government believes "the time is not yet ripe for discussing this issue."

    Indian representative Menon spoke, requesting the adoption of the Soviet proposal. He said: "The fact that the United States or any country does not recognize China does not eliminate China. Non-recognition is not a creative act." He said that the General Assembly should correct this error. "We hope that this will be the last time we have to raise this issue, and we hope that this Assembly will adopt this proposal to correct the issue of China's representation."

    Menon said: "We should not continue to repeat our past decisions without considering the constantly changing world situation. We will vote against the American suggestion, which would mean declaring to the world that the barriers excluding people are recognized by the Assembly."

    Menon emphatically said that the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly should now consider the issue of Chinese representation in light of the recent friendly atmosphere.

    Polish representative Naszkowski then spoke, requesting support for the Soviet proposal. He pointed out that adopting this proposal is extremely important for expanding the friendly atmosphere between nations.

    Burmese representative Barrington then spoke. He pointed out that only the representatives of the People's Republic of China have the right to occupy China's seat in the United Nations. He said that Burma would support any motion to achieve this goal and would vote against any motion depriving China of its rightful place in the United Nations organization.

    Czechoslovakian representative Václav David spoke in favor of the United Nations immediately admitting the People's Republic of China. He pointed out that, as a result of the Geneva Conference, there is now hope for further easing tensions and establishing greater trust between countries. Restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will help promote this goal.

    The Yugoslav representative made a brief speech, expressing support for the Soviet proposal.

    Iraqi representative Jamali spoke against discussing the issue.

    Indonesian representative Hanifa spoke in favor of the Soviet proposal. He said that Indonesia believes that the government of the People's Republic of China should occupy the seat in the United Nations. He said: "This issue is extremely important for the peace and stability of the Far East. The Bandung Conference showed that the government of the People's Republic of China is fully capable of contributing its share to the easing of tensions and the strengthening of world peace. Continuing to postpone the discussion of this issue is unrealistic in terms of the trend of world affairs."

    Next, Soviet representative Molotov spoke again, requesting the meeting to adopt the Soviet delegation's proposal.

    The meeting then voted on the issue of debate. The American-controlled mechanical majority first passed the granting of priority in voting to the American proposal, and then passed the American proposal with forty-two votes in favor, twelve votes against, and six abstentions. Those voting against the American proposal were: Burma, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, India, Indonesia, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. Those abstaining were: Afghanistan, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen.

    The meeting then held the election of the President of the Tenth General Assembly of the United Nations. As a result of the vote, Chilean representative Maza was elected with all sixty votes.

    In his address after taking the chair, Maza said that the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, even in the darkest of times, have pointed the way for peaceful coexistence to all the peoples of the world.

    Maza said that the United Nations is meeting this year in a changed atmosphere, and international public opinion is slowly but surely believing that the necessary preconditions for achieving and maintaining peace are: the countries bearing the greatest responsibility for collective security should make sincere expressions to each other. Any action that establishes or expands this sincerity is warmly welcomed by world public opinion.

    After Maza spoke, he announced the establishment of the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. No one objected to this. The meeting then announced a recess.

    联合国大会第十届会议开幕
    苏联等国主张恢复我国合法权利
    据新华社二十一日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十届会议九月二十日纽约当地时间十五时十五分在联合国总部开幕。
    在会议大厅中聚集着联合国所有六十个会员国的代表团。出席会议的苏联代表团团长是苏联外交部长莫洛托夫，美国代表团团长是国务卿杜勒斯，英国是外交大臣麦克米伦，法国是外交部长比内。
    荷兰代表团团长、外交大臣伦斯代替缺席的联合国大会第九届会议主席范克里芬斯担任主席。
    伦斯在致开幕词时说，这届会议是在新的国际环境下开始工作的。伦斯特别指出日内瓦四国政府首脑会议在缓和国际紧张局势方面的作用。伦斯说，在新的国际环境中，他不认为联合国大会第十届会议是一个一大批代表各个国家、各种意识形态、各种利益的人的会议。他说，我认为，我们代表着在为全人类争取和平、安全和进步这一共同的目标下团结起来的世界。
    伦斯说，今年我们有一切理由比以往任何时候都更具有信心，相信联合国在这个已经改善了的气氛中会成为更有效和更重要的组织。
    苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫接着就关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利的问题发言。他向大会提出一项提案。提案说：“大会决定，中华人民共和国中央人民政府任命的代表是中国驻联合国大会和联合国其他机构中的代表。”莫洛托夫要求大会通过这个提案。
    美国代表洛奇发言，反对莫洛托夫的提案。洛奇提出一个提案，提议联合国大会本届会议不考虑关于中国在联合国中的代表权的问题。
    大会代表接着就苏联和美国的提案发言。
    英国代表纳丁发言支持美国的提案。纳丁说，英国政府认为“中国在联合国的代表权问题是这样的一些问题之一，这些问题必须予以解决，然后远东的正常的和平关系才可以重新建立”。但是他又说，在这个“争论很大的问题上进行辩论是害多利少的”，英国政府认为“讨论这个问题的时机尚未到来”。
    印度代表梅农发言，要求通过苏联的提案。他说：美国或任何国家不承认中国这件事，并不能消灭中国。不承认并不是一种创造性的行动。他说，大会应当矫正这种错误。我们希望这将是我们不得不提出这个问题的最后一次，并且希望这次大会会通过这个提案以矫正中国的代表权问题。
    梅农说：我们不应该继续重复我们过去的决定而不考虑在不断变化的世界形势。我们要投票反对美国的建议，这种建议将会意味着向世界宣告：把人们排斥在外的障碍是得到大会的认可的。
    梅农着重地说，联合国大会第十届会议现在就应该参照最近的友善气氛考虑中国代表权的问题。
    波兰代表纳斯科夫斯基接着发言，他要求支持苏联的提案。他指出，通过这个提案，对于扩大国际间的友善气氛是十分重要的。
    缅甸代表巴林顿随即发言。他指出，只有中华人民共和国的代表才有权占有中国在联合国中的席位。他说，缅甸将支持为实现这一目的的任何动议，并且将投票反对剥夺中国在联合国组织中应有的位置的任何动议。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表瓦茨拉夫·戴维发言赞成联合国立即接纳中华人民共和国。他指出，由于日内瓦会议的结果，现在有希望进一步缓和紧张局势，建立国与国之间的更大的信任。恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利将有助于促进这一目的。
    南斯拉夫代表作了简短的发言，表示赞成苏联的提案。
    伊拉克代表贾马利在发言中反对讨论这个问题。
    印度尼西亚代表汉尼法发言，赞成苏联的提案。他说，印度尼西亚认为，中华人民共和国政府应该占有联合国中的席位。他说：对于远东的和平稳定局势来说，这个问题是极其重要的。万隆会议表明，中华人民共和国政府完全有能力来对紧张局势的缓和及世界和平的加强贡献出它的一分力量。现在再继续推迟这个问题的讨论，按世界事务的趋势来说是不现实的。
    接着，苏联代表莫洛托夫再次发言，要求会议通过苏联代表团的提案。
    会议随后就辩论的问题进行表决。美国所控制的机械多数首先通过给美国提案以表决的优先权，接着又以四十二票赞成、十二票反对、六票弃权通过美国提案。投票反对美国提案的有：缅甸、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、印度、印度尼西亚、挪威、波兰、瑞典、乌克兰、苏联和南斯拉夫。弃权的有：阿富汗、埃及、以色列、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和也门。
    会议接着举行联合国第十届大会主席的选举，投票结果，智利代表马萨以全体六十票当选。
    马萨在就主席位以后致词说，联合国宪章的基本原则，甚至在最黑暗的时刻里，也对全世界各国人民指明了和平共处的道路。
    马萨说，联合国今年在改变了的气氛中开会，国际舆论正慢慢地但是肯定地相信实现和维护和平的必要先决条件是：对集体安全担负最大责任的各国，应当相互作出诚意的表示。任何建立或扩大这种诚意的行动，都受到世界公众舆论的热烈欢迎。
    马萨发言后，他宣布成立联合国大会特别政治委员会。没有人对此表示反对。会议接着宣布休会。
