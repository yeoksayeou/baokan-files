    We Want to Build Barren Hills into an Ocean of Forests
    To the Editor:
    The staff of our Daqingshan Forest Farm in Guangxi Province are now engaged in an intense labor to build this forestry base in southern China. We want to transform the current barren hills into a sea of forests, and we want Daqingshan to supply a large amount of timber and forestry products for the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Daqingshan stands on the border between our country and Vietnam. On this vast mountainous area, the soil is very fertile, and the humus-rich black topsoil is several inches thick. When you grab it in your hand and squeeze it hard, it's like oil comes out; plus, the climate is warm and the rainfall is abundant, so the trees grow very fast. Chinese fir trees that are less than twenty years old have a diameter of seven or eight inches four feet above the ground.
    In the socialist construction of the motherland, the task of the Daqingshan Forest Farm is to cultivate strong and tall timber forests of excellent quality on more than one million mu of barren hills distributed in the territory of two counties. During this year's intense tree-planting season, in addition to the active participation of all the staff of the forest farm in the tree-planting campaign, more than 1,000 people from several nearby counties carried their luggage, trekked through mountains and rivers, and came to Daqingshan to support the country's forestry construction. After the forest farm conducted some political and ideological education and technical education for them, many people made vows to engage in forestry work for life. For example, Que Guangting and Mo Zhenyi, two young primary school graduates, were both very thin, and when some comrades worried that they could not persist in this kind of work, they said with full confidence: "We guarantee that our work will keep up with others."
    Our work enthusiasm quickly overcame the difficulties. On the steep slopes where it was almost impossible to stand, we cut down tall Miscanthus grasses that were taller than people, and planted young seedlings. In this way, the barren hills changed their original appearance. From the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, every tree pit was planted with green little fir trees, full of vitality. This scene makes people think that in the near future, in this boundless mountain, there will be an ocean of forests, and large quantities of straight and thick timber will be continuously transported from the river to the place where the motherland needs it most.
    Daqingshan is a nursery for the development of forestry in the motherland and a treasure house for the study of forestry science. In the natural forest, there are various kinds of trees and medicinal plants: the seeds of some trees (such as mountain loquat) produce oil that is beautiful in color and delicious in taste; the seeds of some trees can produce good industrial oil, and applying it to machines can prevent oil stains. Many plants need to be identified; the utilization value of many woods needs to be studied; fast-growing tree species with excellent material are yet to be discovered; and how to cultivate various medicinal plants under the forest should also be tested. We hope that forestry experts and people who are interested in forestry can come to Daqingshan to conduct research work with us, so that this "treasure house" of forest can play a greater role in the socialist construction of the motherland!

### 我们要把荒山建设成森林的海洋

    我们要把荒山建设成森林的海洋编辑同志：
    我们广西省大青山林场的职工们，现在正以紧张的劳动为建设祖国南方的这个林业基地而斗争。我们要把现在的荒山变成林海，我们要使大青山在祖国社会主义建设中供应大量的木材和林业产品。
    大青山矗立在我国同越南接壤的边境上。在这个面积广阔的山地上，土质非常肥沃，富有腐植质的黑色表土有几寸厚，抓在手里用力一握，就像有油出来似的；加上气候温暖，雨量充沛，林木生长得很快，不满二十年生的杉木，离地面四尺处的直径就有七、八寸。
    在祖国的社会主义建设中，大青山林场的任务，是要把分布在两个县境内的一百多万亩荒山，营造起粗壮高大、材质优良的用材林。今年造林紧张的季节里，除了林场全体职工积极投入造林运动外，还有附近几个县里的一千多人，背着行李，跋山涉水，来到大青山支援祖国的林业建设。经过林场对他们进行了一些政治思想教育和技术教育以后，很多人都立下了终生从事林业工作的誓愿。例如阙光廷和莫振义这两个年轻的小学毕业生，他们身体都很瘦弱，当有些同志担心他们不能坚持这种工作时，他们都信心十足地说：“保证工作赶得上别人。”
    我们的工作热情，使困难很快被克服了。我们在陡峻得几乎连人都站不住脚的山坡上，割掉了比人还高的大芒草，种下了幼小的树苗。就这样，荒山改变了原来的面貌，从山顶到山脚的每个树坑里，都栽上了绿油油的小杉树，充满了生气。这种景象使人们不禁想到：不久的将来，在这无边无际的山上，就会出现一片森林的海洋，而大批通直粗大的栋梁材就会从河里源源不断的运到祖国最需要它的地方去。
    大青山是祖国发展林业的一个苗圃，也是研究林业科学的一个宝库。在天然林里，有各种各样的树木和药用植物：有些树木的种子（如山枇杷），榨出油来色泽美丽，并且味道鲜美；有些树木的种子，能够榨出良好的工业用油，用它涂抹机器可以不生油渍。不少的植物需要鉴定；许多木材的利用价值需要研究；生长快、材质优良的树种还待发现；各种药用植物如何在林下栽培也应该试验。我们希望林业专家和有志于林业事业的人们能够到大青山来，同我们一起进行研究的工作，让这个森林的“宝库”在祖国社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用！
