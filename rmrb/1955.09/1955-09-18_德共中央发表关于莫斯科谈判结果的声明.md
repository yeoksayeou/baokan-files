    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 17th, TASS dispatch: The German News Agency broadcast the statement of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party on the results of the Moscow negotiations.
    The statement said that the German Communist Party, like all workers in West Germany, welcomes the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, considering it a major step forward in easing international tensions and a contribution to the reunification of Germany. The results of the Moscow negotiations are a victory for the forces of peace, especially the victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and those in the Federal Republic who hope to reach an agreement.
    The statement further said that the negotiations clearly demonstrated that the Bonn government's attempt to bring all of Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will never be realized. Only through cooperation between the two Germanies can reunification be peacefully restored.

    德共中央发表关于莫斯科谈判结果的声明
    新华社十七日讯  塔斯社柏林十七日讯：德意志通讯社广播了德国共产党中央委员会关于莫斯科谈判结果的声明。
    声明中说道，德国共产党，像西德所有劳动者一样，欢迎苏联和西德建立外交关系，认为这是在缓和国际紧张局势的道路上迈进了一大步，并且是对重新统一德国的一个贡献。莫斯科谈判的结果，是和平力量的胜利，特别是苏联和平政策和联邦共和国内希望达成协议的人们的胜利。
    声明又说，这次谈判清楚地说明了波恩政府打算使整个德国加入北大西洋公约组织的企图是决不能实现的。只有通过两个德国的合作才能和平地恢复统一。
