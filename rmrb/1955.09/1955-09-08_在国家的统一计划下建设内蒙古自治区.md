Building the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Under the Nation's Unified Plan
Hu Zhaoheng, Deputy Director of the Planning Commission of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

I.

Since 1947, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia region have implemented regional autonomy, carried out social reforms and land reform, strengthened the unity of all ethnic groups, and rapidly restored and developed the autonomous region's economy and cultural undertakings. By the end of 1952, the autonomous region's grain output had reached more than 2,923,000 tons, and livestock had reached more than 14,006,000 heads. Agricultural and animal husbandry production had exceeded the highest level before liberation. At the same time, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement had developed considerably, with peasant households participating in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives accounting for 51.4% of the total peasant households. The total output value of local industry reached 48,569,000 yuan, an increase of 133.46% over 1949. State-owned and cooperative commercial networks have spread throughout the vast rural and pastoral areas, with retail sales reaching 147 million yuan, accounting for 49% of the total social commodity retail sales in the region. Education, health, culture and other undertakings have developed even more significantly. This has provided us with the political and economic conditions to enter into planned economic construction along with the people of the whole country.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the great motherland, and the construction of the autonomous region is also an integral part of the national construction. After the general task of the state during the transition period was put forward, especially in the process of implementing the national economic development plan, the construction of the autonomous region was further closely coordinated with the national construction, and the solution of tasks in terms of ethnic issues was closely integrated with the socialist construction of the motherland.

Based on the Party's general line during the transition period, we deeply realize that only by building a socialist society can we ensure the high development of all ethnic groups in the economic and cultural fields, eliminate the historical inequalities between ethnic groups in culture and economy, and enable backward ethnic groups to catch up with advanced ethnic groups.

One of the basic tasks of our country's first Five-Year Plan is to establish the initial foundation for our country's socialist industrialization. The laying of this foundation will provide decisive conditions for fundamentally changing the face of the country and the face of the nation, and will enable the country to use greater strength to help minority nationalities develop their economic and cultural undertakings. During the first Five-Year Plan, the state began to build the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, actively develop the Greater Khingan Range forest industry, build the Jining-Erlian railway, build the Baotou-Lanzhou railway leading to the Great Northwest, and began the overall construction of harnessing the Yellow River, which has a huge relationship with the happiness of the people of Inner Mongolia. The construction of these major projects will promote the construction of new cities and towns and the development of local economy and culture.

The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region will further realize the consistency of partial interests and overall interests, national interests and national interests from the first Five-Year Plan, thereby further enhancing patriotism and internationalism, and striving for the complete realization of the Five-Year Plan!

Under the guidance of the national unified plan, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has formulated the basic tasks of its first Five-Year Plan: vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production centered on mutual aid and cooperation to support the country's socialist industrialization; vigorously support the country's key construction projects, especially the construction of the Baotou industrial base; actively develop local industry, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, post and telecommunications, commerce, education, health, culture and other undertakings according to plan; actively and steadily implement the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; ensure the proportion of socialist economic components continues to grow, completely realize the national plan, and lay a preliminary foundation for changing the economic and cultural outlook of the autonomous region. This basic task is in line with the Party's general line during the transition period, the country's first Five-Year Plan, and the requirements for further construction of the autonomous region. Its realization will be conducive to the country's socialist construction and to solving the ethnic issues within the autonomous region.

II.

The autonomous region's first Five-Year Plan stipulates the following targets: a 26.7% increase in total grain output, reaching 1,056 jin per person by 1957, and more than 1,300 jin per farmer. Peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives will reach more than 50% of the total peasant households in the region. The total number of livestock (excluding camels and pigs) will increase by 75%; by 1957, there will be 37 heads of livestock per person in purely pastoral areas. The total output value of local industry will increase by more than two and a half times, and the average industrial output value per person in the region (including the output value of industrial units under the central government) will increase from 17.8 yuan to 61.69 yuan. The total retail sales of commerce in the region will increase by one and a half times in five years, and residents' purchasing power will increase by 90% in five years. The total amount of funds allocated for local economic construction and social, cultural and educational construction in the region in five years is equivalent to more than 6.6 million taels of gold. It was beyond the dreams of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia to invest such a huge amount of money in construction undertakings in the past. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the development speed of other undertakings will also be very fast. Before liberation, Inner Mongolia had no institutions of higher learning. By 1957, there will be three institutions of higher learning with more than 2,000 students, more than three times the number in 1952. The number of secondary school students will increase by about three times; the number of primary school students will increase by 46%, and the enrollment rate of school-age children will reach 81.4%. There will be 140 film projection teams, an increase of 122 teams over 1952.

For the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has a very backward economic and cultural foundation, this is an arduous task. Without the guidance of the national unified economic plan and without the support of the country in all aspects, it would be impossible to complete this major historical task. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region must strengthen their overall concept in economic construction and respond to the call of the motherland to actively complete and overfulfill the tasks stipulated in the national plan on a daily, monthly, and annual basis.

An important manifestation of strengthening the overall concept is to obey the country's unified overall plan, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, ensure the completion of the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, the development of the Greater Khingan Range forest industry, the harnessing of the Yellow River, and the construction of various important railways. The facts are also like this. From a planning perspective, in the autonomous region's various construction investments, the total investment in basic construction in Baotou City accounts for 35.73% of the total investment in the region during the five years; the investment in basic construction of local industry accounts for 30.17% of the total investment in the region. After the basic construction projects of local industry are put into production, the proportion of the total output value of local industry in Baotou City to the total output value of local industry in the region will increase from 18% to 25%. It can be seen from this that supporting the industrial construction of Baotou is very important for the development of national steel production and the development of Inner Mongolia's local industry. In the recent two or three years, Inner Mongolia, which is vast and sparsely populated, has also supported the construction of the Jining-Erlian railway with nearly 60,000 various types of labor force. A lot of work has also been done for the Greater Khingan Range forest industry in terms of fire prevention, forest protection, resource exploration, labor and transportation supply, and social and cultural services. All this shows that the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia regard developing production and supporting national key construction as the primary glorious task.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an ethnic autonomous region with the Mongolian nationality as the main body. There are not only Mongolian and Han nationalities in the region, but also other minority nationalities. The economic forms are complex and scattered, the production methods and development levels are different, the material resources are rich, the labor force is relatively small, and the transportation in the region is inconvenient. Therefore, in the construction of the autonomous region, we must fully pay attention to ethnic characteristics and regional characteristics, jointly develop on the basis of ethnic unity and mutual assistance, take care of special needs under the unified construction plan; concretize the Party's ethnic policy and unified plan, and implement them according to local conditions, and oppose both impetuosity and rigid application and standing still.

III.

In the past two years, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved results in implementing the national plan under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. By the end of 1954, agricultural output had increased by 16.21% compared with 1952, overfulfilling the annual plan by 3.34%; animal husbandry, despite suffering from serious natural disasters in some areas, still completed the annual livestock breeding plan, with the total number increasing by 39.15% compared with 1952; local industry overfulfilled the national plan by 3.01%; the total amount of basic construction work completed 26.48% of the Five-Year Plan; by 1955, peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 16.7% of the total peasant households, and more than 86% of the townships in the region had established cooperatives; about 30% of the total number of pastoral households participated in pastoral mutual aid and cooperation. All this has created favorable conditions for us to complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan.

To realize the first Five-Year Plan, we must work even harder. At present, practicing strict economy and opposing waste is an important condition for the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan. In the autonomous region's various production and construction projects, in various government agencies, in various localities within the region, and among some people, there are phenomena of waste, and the situation in some departments is quite serious. We must actively respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to oppose waste and practice strict economy, carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education on increasing production and practicing economy, resolutely and conscientiously implement all regulations related to comprehensive economy, and carry forward the spirit of diligence and thrift and hard work. The complete realization of the Five-Year Plan is a great victory for the common cause of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and it is the enemy's defeat. The enemy is unwilling to fail. Therefore, we must overcome right-leaning paralysis, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and ensure the victorious completion of the socialist construction cause. (Attached pictures)

    在国家的统一计划下建设内蒙古自治区
    内蒙古自治区计划委员会副主任　胡昭衡
    一
    一九四七年以来，内蒙古地区各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，实行了区域自治，进行了社会改革和土地改革，增强了各族人民的团结，迅速恢复和发展了自治区的经济和文化事业。到一九五二年底，自治区粮食产量达到二百九十二万三千多吨，牲畜达到一千四百万六千多头，农业和畜牧业生产已超过解放前的最高水平；同时，农业互助合作运动有了相当发展，参加互助组和农业生产合作社的农户占总农户的百分之五十一点四。地方工业总产值达到四千八百五十六万九千元，较一九四九年增长百分之一百三十三点四六。国营和合作社营的商业网已经遍布广大农村和牧区，零售额达到一亿四千七百万元，占全区社会商品零售总额的百分之四十九。教育、卫生、文化等事业，发展得更显著。这就使我们在政治上和经济上具备了随同全国人民进入有计划的经济建设的条件。
    内蒙古自治区是伟大祖国不可分割的一部分，自治区的建设也是国家建设的一个组成部分。国家过渡时期的总任务提出以后，特别在执行国家发展国民经济计划的过程中，自治区的建设就同国家建设进一步密切配合起来，民族问题方面任务的解决也同祖国的社会主义建设紧密地结合起来。
    依据党在过渡时期的总路线，我们深切体会到，只有建成社会主义社会，才能保证各民族在经济和文化方面得到高度的发展，才能消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间在文化和经济方面的不平等，使落后的民族赶上先进的民族。
    我国第一个五年计划的基本任务之一，是建立我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础。这一基础的奠定，将为根本改变国家面貌和民族面貌具备决定性的条件，将使国家有可能用更大力量帮助少数民族发展经济、文化事业。国家在第一个五年计划中，开始在内蒙古自治区建设包头钢铁联合企业，积极发展大兴安岭森林工业，修建集宁到二连的铁路，修建通往大西北的包头到兰州的铁路，开始了对内蒙古人民幸福有巨大关系的根治黄河的总体建设。这些重大工程的建设，将促进新的城镇的兴建和当地经济、文化的发展。
    自治区各族人民将从第一个五年计划中进一步体会到部分利益同整体利益、民族利益和国家利益的一致性，从而更加提高爱国主义和国际主义精神，为完满实现五年计划而奋斗！
    在国家统一计划指导下，内蒙古自治区规定了本区的第一个五年计划的基本任务：大力发展以互助合作为中心的农牧业生产，支援国家社会主义工业化；大力支援国家重点建设，特别是包头工业基地的建设；按计划积极发展地方工业、林业、水利、运输、邮电、商业、教育、卫生、文化等事业；积极地、稳步地实行对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造；保证社会主义经济成分的比重不断增长，完满实现国家计划，为改变自治区的经济文化面貌奠定初步基础。这一基本任务是符合党在过渡时期的总路线，符合国家第一个五年计划以及进一步建设自治区的要求的。它的实现，将有利于国家的社会主义建设，有利于解决自治区内的民族问题。
    二
    自治区的第一个五年计划中规定了以下的指标：粮食总产量增长百分之二十六点七，到一九五七年，每人平均有一千零五十六斤粮食，每一农民平均有一千三百多斤。农业生产合作社入社农户，将达到全区总农户的百分之五十以上。牲畜总头数
  （不包括骆驼和猪）增长百分之七十五；到一九五七年，纯牧区每人将有三十七头牲畜。地方工业总产值将增长两倍半多，全区每人平均工业产值（包括中央各单位工业产值）将由十七点八元达到六十一点六九元。全区商业零售总额五年内将增加一倍半，居民购买力五年内将增加百分之九十。五年内全区地方经济建设和社会文教建设的拨款总额折合黄金约为六百六十多万两。把这样巨额款项投资在建设事业上，是内蒙古各族人民过去所梦想不到的。五年计划规定其他事业发展的速度也很快，解放以前，内蒙古没有高等学校，到一九五七年，将有高等学校三所，学生二千多人，较一九五二年增长两倍多。中等学校学生数将增加约三倍；小学学生数将增加百分之四十六，学龄儿童的就学率将达到百分之八十一点四。电影放映队将达到一百四十队，较一九五二年增加一百二十二队。
    对于经济文化基础都很落后的内蒙古自治区来说，这是一个艰巨的任务。没有国家统一的经济计划的指导，没有国家从各方面给以支援，要想完成这项重大的历史任务是不可能的。因此，自治区各族人民在经济建设中必须加强整体观念，要响应祖国号召，按日、按月、按年积极完成和超额完成国家计划所规定的任务。
    加强整体观念的重要表现是服从国家的统一的整体计划，在党中央和国务院的领导下，保证包头钢铁联合企业的建设、大兴安岭森林工业的发展、根治黄河以及各重要铁路的修建的任务的完成。事实也是这样，从计划上来看，在自治区各项建设投资中，在五年内，包头市基本建设投资总额占全区投资总额的百分之三十五点七三；地方工业基本建设投资占全区的百分之三十点一七。地方工业基本建设项目投入生产后，包头市地方工业总产值占全区地方工业总产值的比重，将由百分之十八上升为百分之二十五。由此可见，支援包头的工业建设，对发展国家的钢铁生产和发展内蒙地方工业方面，都是十分重要的。最近两三年内，地广人稀的内蒙古还以约近六万的各类劳动力支援了集宁—二连铁路的修建。对大兴安岭森林工业，在防火护林、资源勘查、劳动力及运输力供应、社会文化服务等方面，也都做了不少工作。这一切，都说明内蒙古各族人民是把发展生产、支援国家重点建设当做首要的光荣任务的。
    内蒙古自治区是以蒙古民族为主体的民族自治区，区内不仅有蒙汉两民族，而且有其他多种少数民族，经济形态复杂、分散，生产方式和发展水平有所不同，物质资源丰富，劳动力比较少，区内交通不便。因此，在自治区建设中，要充分注意民族特点和地区特点，在民族团结互助的基础上共同发展，在统一建设计划下照顾特殊需要；把党的民族政策和统一计划具体化，因地制宜地加以贯彻实现，既要反对急躁硬套，又要反对固步自封。三
    过去两年，内蒙古自治区各族人民在党和人民政府领导下，执行国家计划是有成绩的。到一九五四年底，农业产量较一九五二年提高百分之一十六点二一，超额完成年度计划百分之三点三四；牧业在部分地区遭受严重的自然灾害的条件下，仍然完成牲畜年度增殖计划，总头数较一九五二年提高百分之三十九点一五；地方工业超额完成国家计划百分之三点○一；基本建设工作总量完成五年计划百分之二十六点四八；到一九五五年，农业生产合作社入社农户占总农户的百分之十六点七，全区百分之八十六多的乡均已建社；参加牧业互助合作的牧户约占总牧户的百分之三十。这一切都给我们完成和超额完成五年计划创造了有利条件。
    要实现第一个五年计划，我们还要加倍地努力。在当前，厉行节约反对浪费是胜利完成第一个五年计划的重要条件。在自治区的各项生产和建设中，在各机关中，在区内各地方以及部分人民群众中，浪费现象是有的，其中有的部门的情况是相当严重的。我们必须积极响应党中央和国务院提出的反对浪费厉行节约的号召，广泛深入地进行增产节约的宣传教育，坚决认真地执行一切有关全面节约的规定，发扬克勤克俭艰苦奋斗的作风。五年计划的完满实现，就是我国各族人民共同事业的巨大胜利，就是敌人的失败。敌人是不甘心失败的，因此，我们必须克服右倾麻痹思想，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，保证社会主义建设事业的胜利完成。（附图片）
