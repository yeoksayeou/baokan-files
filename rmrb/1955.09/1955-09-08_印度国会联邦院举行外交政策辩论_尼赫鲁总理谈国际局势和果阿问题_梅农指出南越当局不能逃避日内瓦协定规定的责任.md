Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 7th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, speaking on the 6th during a foreign policy debate in the Indian Parliament's Council of States, said, "For the first time in the last decade, we have reached a stage where the Cold War is neither as cold nor as hot as it used to be." He also said, "However, there are still many forces in the world that may not approve of this change towards improved international relations. Therefore, we must treat this with caution and observe the development of the situation very carefully."

    Regarding the Indochina issue, Nehru said that three international committees were working there. Each committee faced difficult problems. Perhaps the most difficult was the Vietnam issue. "The difficulty arises there because one of the governments seems unwilling to accept the Geneva Accords." This created difficulties for India and everyone else. Nehru said that the negotiations on elections that should have been held did not take place, and this itself was a failure to comply with the terms of the agreement, which was very unfortunate. Nehru then stated that India "will continue to point out to the parties concerned the agreement and the need to abide by it."

    Prime Minister Nehru said: "The members of each committee have done a good job in eliminating and overcoming various difficulties. If they had not done so and the Geneva Accords had collapsed, military conflict would have occurred again. However, the time has come when we must contact the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and submit our difficulties to them, and if necessary, at a later stage, submit those difficulties to all the countries participating in the Geneva Conference."

    Speaking on the Malaya issue, Nehru expressed that all parties should seek peaceful solutions. He said, "Whether in Malaya or Kenya or anywhere else, we hope that all parties will negotiate in a peaceful manner."

    Nehru mentioned the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and said that the situation in North Africa, especially in Morocco and Algeria, was "very serious, unpleasant, and tragic." There was no doubt that what was happening in Morocco and Algeria greatly moved everyone in India and all of Asia.

    Nehru's speech mostly concerned the Goa issue. He said that there could only be one solution to the Goa issue, which was to end Portuguese rule and merge Goa with India.

    He said that the Asian-African Conference's resolution on colonialism applied to all places with colonial rule. It certainly applied to situations like Goa, just as it applied to North African countries. Nehru continued by saying that almost all Asian countries naturally adopted an anti-colonial attitude—they supported Goa's liberation from Portuguese control. He also said that, in general, newspapers in Asia and many countries in Europe and the Americas recognized that Portugal's continued rule over Goa was completely against the tide of the times.

    Nehru paid tribute to the Indian peaceful resisters who entered Goa on August 15th, saying that such heroism and courageous actions deeply awakened and powerfully moved the people of the whole country. Their courage powerfully moved the people of the whole country, and the actions of the Portuguese authorities further stirred the people of the whole country. He had not heard at all that these people carried weapons or engaged in violent acts, yet the Portuguese still opened fire on them and abused them. Many of them lost their lives, and more were beaten and expelled. Nehru said that the actions taken by the Portuguese government on August 15th were wrong from the standpoint of international law, international standards of conduct, and etiquette.

    Nehru said: "It would obviously be easy to take some military measures and occupy Goa." However, he also said: "We obviously should not take military measures. We should limit ourselves to using peaceful methods to remove Portuguese rule." Nehru also said, "Under the current circumstances, collective peaceful resistance is certainly inappropriate, and individual peaceful resistance is also inappropriate." He expressed disapproval of Indian volunteers continuing to enter Goa.

    Answering questions, Nehru also said: "One of the great changes that has occurred in the world in recent months is the remarkable attitude taken towards peaceful solutions. Today, in Geneva, the ambassadors of the United States and the People's Republic of China are sitting together for negotiations, which is no small matter. They may be negotiating small issues, although the issues are not that small. However, the very fact that representatives of these two major powers, who have been so hostile to each other and have not yet recognized each other, are sitting together for negotiations illustrates that there is a tremendous change in the entire atmosphere of the world."

    At the end of the debate, the Council of States approved the government's foreign policy. The motion passed by the Council of States stated that this policy had particularly promoted the acceptance of the Five Principles by many countries and had promoted the relaxation of international tensions.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 7th: India's Chief Representative to the United Nations, V. K. Krishna Menon, speaking on the 6th during a foreign policy debate in the Indian Parliament, said that no one should doubt that the South Vietnamese authorities are "wholly and completely bound by the Geneva Accords," and now the South Vietnamese authorities cannot evade the responsibilities stipulated by this agreement.

    Menon explained that although the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam did not have the right and obligation to preside over the elections there, its responsibility was to promote mutual agreement between the two parties to conduct the elections.

    Menon said that all countries that supported the Geneva Accords had a legal and moral obligation to use all means of peaceful adjustment and consultation to ensure that the agreement was fulfilled.

    Menon also spoke about the issue of arms reduction, saying that this was a major issue to be discussed at the upcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly. He said that unless China participated, discussions or agreements reached on the issue of arms reduction "could not have any value."

### 印度国会联邦院举行外交政策辩论  尼赫鲁总理谈国际局势和果阿问题  梅农指出南越当局不能逃避日内瓦协定规定的责任

    印度国会联邦院举行外交政策辩论
    尼赫鲁总理谈国际局势和果阿问题
    梅农指出南越当局不能逃避日内瓦协定规定的责任
    新华社新德里七日电　印度总理尼赫鲁六日在印度国会联邦院进行外交政策辩论时发言说，“在最近十年以来，我们第一次达到了冷战不像过去那样的冷或那样的热的阶段”。他又说，但是世界上还有很多的势力可能并不赞成这种国际关系走向改善的改变。因此，我们对此必须谨慎对待，并且非常仔细地注视情况的发展。
    尼赫鲁在谈到印度支那问题时说，三个国际委员会是在那里工作。每一个委员会都面临着困难问题。也许最困难的是越南问题。“困难所以在那里产生，是由于政府之一似乎不愿意接受日内瓦协定”。这为印度和每一个人造成了困难。尼赫鲁说，应该举行的关于选举的谈判没有举行，这件事本身就是不遵守协定条款，这是很不幸的。尼赫鲁接着表示，印度“将继续向有关方面指出协定和遵守它的必要”。
    尼赫鲁总理说：“各委员会的全体委员在消除和克服各种困难上已经做了良好的工作。如果他们不是这样而日内瓦协定垮了台，那末，军事冲突就会再度发生。然而，时机已经来到，我们必须同日内瓦会议的两个主席接洽，把我们的困难提交他们，如果必要的话，在后一阶段把那些困难提交参加日内瓦会议的所有的国家。”
    在谈到马来亚问题时，尼赫鲁表示各方应谋求和平的办法。他说：“不论是在马来亚或是怯尼亚或是其他任何地方，我们希望各方面都以和平的方式来进行谈判。”
    尼赫鲁提到亚非会议的决议，并且说，北非的局势，尤其是摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的局势是“很严重的，令人不愉快的和悲惨的”。毫无疑问，摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚发生的事情大大激动了印度的每一个人和全亚洲的人。
    尼赫鲁的发言大部分是谈果阿问题。他说，果阿问题只可能有一个解决办法，那就是：结束葡萄牙的统治，果阿同印度合并。
    他说，亚非会议关于殖民主义问题的决议适用于有殖民统治的一切地方。它当然适用于像果阿那样的情况，正如它适用于北非国家一样。尼赫鲁接着说，几乎亚洲一切国家都很自然地采取反殖民主义的态度——它们赞成果阿摆脱葡萄牙的控制。他又说，一般说来，亚洲的报纸以及欧洲、南北美洲许多国家的报纸都承认葡萄牙继续统治果阿是完全违背时代潮流的。
      尼赫鲁对八月十五日进入果阿的印度和平抵抗者表示敬意，他说，这样的英雄主义和勇敢的行动深深地唤醒了并且有力地感动了全国人民。他们的勇气有力地激动了全国人民，葡萄牙当局的所作所为更进一步激动了全国人民。他一点也没有听见说这些人带了武器或者从事暴力行动，然而葡萄牙人仍然对他们开火并对他们进行虐待。他们中有不少人丧失了生命，更多的人受到了殴打并且被驱逐了出来。尼赫鲁说，葡萄牙政府在八月十五日所采取的行动从国际法、国际行为标准和礼仪的观点来看是很错误的。
    尼赫鲁说：“要采取一些军事措施并占有果阿显然是很容易的。”但是，他又说：“我们显然不应当采取军事措施。我们应当只限于使用和平方法来去除葡萄牙的统治。”尼赫鲁还说，“在目前情况下，集体的和平抵抗肯定是不适宜的，而且个人的和平抵抗也是不适宜的。”他表示不赞成印度志愿人员继续进入果阿。
    尼赫鲁在答复问题时又说：“最近几个月来在世界上所出现的巨大的变化之一就是对于和平解决办法所采取的值得注意的态度。今天在日内瓦，美国和中华人民共和国的大使坐在一起进行谈判，这并不是一件小事情。他们可能是在谈判小的问题，虽然问题并不是那样的小。但是，一直是彼此这样敌视并且还没有相互承认的这两个大国的代表坐在一起进行谈判，这个事实本身说明了在世界的整个气氛中有着巨大的变化。”
    在辩论结束时，联邦院批准了政府的外交政策。联邦院通过的动议说：这种政策已经特别促使许多国家都接受了五项原则，并且促使国际紧张局势得到缓和。
    新华社新德里七日电　印度驻联合国首席代表维·克·克里希纳·梅农六日在印度国会举行外交政策辩论时发言说，任何人都不应怀疑：南越当局“整个地、完全地受日内瓦协定的约束”，现在，南越当局不能逃避这个协定规定的责任。
    梅农解释说，虽然越南国际监督和监察委员会没有主持那里的选举的权利和义务，但是它的责任是促进双方一致同意进行选举。
    梅农说，支持日内瓦协定的所有国家负有法律上和道义上的义务，运用和平调整和协商的一切办法来使协定得以履行。
    梅农还谈到裁减军备问题，他说，这是在联合国大会即将举行的会议上要进行讨论的主要问题。他说，除非让中国参加，不然就裁减军备问题进行的讨论或者达成的协议“都不可能具有任何价值”。
