    Ushering in a New Upsurge in the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
    ——Notes from Observing the Fourth Congress of the CCP Hebei Province
    Li Yi
    In the past few years, the agricultural cooperative movement in Hebei Province has achieved great success. The development of the movement has been basically healthy. The great development since last autumn has brought the province's cooperative movement into a new stage, ushering in a high tide of the socialist transformation of agriculture. As of the end of June this year, the province had a total of 97,359 agricultural production cooperatives, with 2,741,400 participating households, accounting for 35.2 percent of the total number of farm households. The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives have increased production, demonstrating their superiority. This has created conditions for basically realizing cooperativization throughout the province, developing agricultural production on a large scale, and finally eliminating rural capitalism. The Fourth Congress of the CCP Hebei Province, when discussing the cooperative movement, first affirmed this achievement.

    The meeting, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, exposed and criticized some erroneous ideas in the development of the agricultural cooperative movement. For example, some comrades mistakenly believed that "the development of agricultural production cooperatives is too fast and exceeds actual possibilities." Facts have proved that this is a right-leaning idea. The emergence of this idea was mainly due to listening too much to the opinions of a few wealthy peasants and ignoring the enthusiasm of the vast majority of poor peasants for taking the socialist road. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the CCP pointed out in its report to the meeting that in the face of this great socialist mass movement, due to insufficient analysis of the situation, the problems that occurred in the development of agricultural production cooperatives were overestimated, to the point that it once wavered and hesitated. In the instructions issued in April this year on the rectification of agricultural production cooperatives, it proposed the policy of concentrating efforts throughout the year on rectification and consolidation, resolutely stopping development, and rationally carrying out contraction. The representative meeting held that it was right to concentrate all efforts on rectification and consolidation throughout the year, and it was also necessary and correct to rationally contract some cooperatives that did not meet the conditions for establishing a cooperative and were manipulated by bad elements. However, resolutely stopping development was a mistake. Although the Provincial Party Committee quickly corrected this error after it was pointed out by the Central Committee in May, its impact was not small, and therefore the lesson was very profound. The development figures determined by the Provincial Party Committee at that time only accounted for 8 to 10 percent of the total number of farm households. Today, it seems too conservative. The ideological situation of various prefectural and county party committees is also mostly like this. Liang Shuangbi, Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Party Committee, said at the meeting: "After the Provincial Party Committee's April instructions, we decided to take a look and then make a firm decision to stop development. In June and July—that is, after the Provincial Party Committee corrected the error of resolutely stopping development—we still only wanted to develop individually and fill in the gaps. Taking a look showed hesitation about developing cooperatives; stopping development meant standing still; filling in the gaps and developing individually also meant standing still." It is very clear that this erroneous instruction directly affected the preparatory work for developing agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring. Secondly, it caused some places to contract cooperatives that should not have been contracted, hurting the socialist enthusiasm of many activists and poor peasants.

    Is the development of agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province too fast, exceeding actual possibilities, and therefore should development be stopped? The facts are naturally not like that at all. On this issue, listening to the opinions of the peasants—especially the vast majority of poor peasants—will clear everyone's minds. When the Shunyi County Party Committee of the CCP demanded the lower levels to contract in general without analyzing the specific situation, it immediately encountered opposition from the vast number of peasants. The poor peasants of Luogezhuang, District 1 of the county, reflected: "If we don't develop cooperatives, won't capitalism develop again?" The poor peasants in the agricultural production cooperative led by Ke Daizi and Su Baozhen in District 6 of the county refused the district's request to change from a cooperative to a mutual aid team. The meeting pointed out that the vast number of peasants are expecting us to organize them, but some of our comrades are standing still, being timid and hesitant. In such a situation, can we still say that the development of agricultural production cooperatives is too fast? The fact is quite the opposite: these comrades are not keeping up with the demands of the masses and are lagging behind the demands of the masses.

    Has the development of agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province exceeded actual possibilities? The meeting pointed out that most of the comrades who hold this view start from such a wish. They seem to feel that since so many cooperatives have been developed all at once, due to lack of experience, can they be consolidated? So they further assume that developing slower and fewer cooperatives may be easier to consolidate, easier to achieve increased production, and show superiority. Facts have proved that this is unnecessary worry. According to statistics at the end of June this year, after the great development of agricultural production cooperatives last winter and this spring, after rectification, only more than 8,000 cooperatives were converted into mutual aid teams or dissolved, accounting for 8.57 percent of the original number of participating households. During the rectification process, according to the demands of the masses, 1,164 new cooperatives were also established. After offsetting the increases and decreases, the actual decrease in the number of households was only 7.34 percent. Of the existing nearly 100,000 cooperatives, 80 percent have increased production, showing their superiority. Judging from the current situation, more than 98 percent of the 714 cooperatives in Mancheng County can increase production, 14 cooperatives are equal to individual farmers, and only one cooperative is lower than individual farmers. By this spring, the number of participating households in Xingtai County had accounted for 66.44 percent of the total number of farm households. In the three mountainous areas, the number of participating households had reached more than 80 percent. Of the 112 townships in the county, 82 townships have been cooperativized, and the villages where cooperatives have been established account for 94 percent of all villages. Has the development of agricultural production cooperatives in Xingtai County been so fast and so numerous that it is impossible to consolidate them? In fact, after active rectification, most of the cooperatives have been consolidated. More than 80 percent of the cooperatives in the county have increased production, especially the agricultural production cooperatives in the mountainous areas, which have achieved more remarkable results. They have carried out many production reforms that individual farmers find difficult to do, such as building water conservancy projects, repairing land on beaches, improving soil quality, and improving agricultural technology. Comrades who are afraid that there will be too many cooperatives to consolidate have overlooked one of the most important factors, namely: Hebei is an old liberated area, with more than 900,000 Communist Party members in the countryside and a large number of poor peasants who are willing to take the socialist road. In the past political movements, a large number of outstanding workers have also been trained. All of this is the most reliable guarantee for realizing agricultural cooperativization.

    The meeting pointed out that in the development of the agricultural production cooperative movement, due to our comrades' lack of experience and insufficient implementation of policies, there have indeed been some deviations and errors. But these are shortcomings in progress, and therefore are not difficult to correct. The experience of rectification in various parts of Hebei Province in the past six months has fully proved this. Let's take the issue of draught animals and farm tools as an example. Some agricultural production cooperatives with a relatively weak economic foundation and whose members lack the habit of collective management and production have encountered some problems due to the premature adoption of the method of converting livestock and farm tools into shares and returning them to the cooperatives. For example, some members were heavily indebted and were temporarily in low spirits; there was a shortage of forage, the sheds were narrow, and there was a lack of collective feeding experience, resulting in the weakness or death of many livestock. However, after the Provincial Party Committee discovered and analyzed these situations and proposed that new cooperatives should generally adopt the method of private ownership and private feeding with the cooperatives renting or hiring, many cooperatives that originally had many problems in this regard were quickly corrected. This fact shows that the occurrence of these problems is not a problem of too fast development of agricultural production cooperatives, but because some comrades have not seriously implemented the policy of voluntary mutual benefit.

    The meeting clearly pointed out that the poor peasants are the political pillar of our party in realizing socialism in the countryside, and relying on the poor peasants is the unswerving fundamental policy of our party in carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture. Only by relying on the poor peasants can we consolidate the unity of the middle peasants and run the agricultural production cooperatives well. On this issue, the meeting focused on criticizing the erroneous understanding of some comrades that "there are few poor peasants, their economic strength is weak, and there is nothing to rely on." The meeting pointed out that the majority of peasants in rural areas whose lives are still difficult and not prosperous still account for the majority of the rural population, and their socialist enthusiasm is very high, and relying on them can realize agricultural cooperativization. Some comrades ignore the poor peasants who are determined to keep the cooperatives running after the middle peasants withdraw from the cooperatives, and fail to give them the necessary active encouragement and support. Some even mistakenly believe that small cooperatives with ten or eight poor peasant households insisting on running them have few farm tools and poor livestock and do not look like a cooperative. Therefore, they either ask them to stop running or disband them, or let them fend for themselves and fight alone. The meeting pointed out that to run agricultural production cooperatives well, it is necessary to establish the political advantage of the poor peasants and give them the necessary economic support to give play to the backbone role of the poor peasants in the agricultural production cooperatives, while consolidating the unity of the middle peasants. This is the main method and way out to give play to the labor enthusiasm of the poor and middle peasants and tap the potential of labor, land and other means of production under the current circumstances where we cannot transform agricultural equipment.

    The biggest gain of this meeting was to criticize and correct the passive and conservative sentiments of many comrades in accordance with the Central Committee's recent instructions on the issue of agricultural production cooperatives. Many comrades have turned from standing still to seriously considering and studying the specific conditions of their regions, actively developing agricultural production cooperatives, and formulating advanced development plans that are in line with actual conditions. In accordance with the Central Committee's instructions and the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," the meeting determined that: on the one hand, we should conscientiously continue to rectify and consolidate the existing agricultural production cooperatives, requiring 90 percent of the cooperatives to achieve increased production; at the same time, we should require the development of 25,000 to 30,000 new cooperatives this winter and next spring, bringing the total number of cooperatives to 120,000 to 127,000; we should require the increase in the number of participating farm households to account for about 15 percent of the total number of farm households, bringing the total number of participating households to about 50 percent of the total number of farm households. By the end of 1958, the number of participating farm households should reach more than 80 percent of the total number of farm households, realizing agricultural cooperativization throughout the province.

    迎接农业合作化运动的新高潮
    ——中共河北省第四次代表会议旁听记
    李翼
    几年来，河北省的农业合作化运动获得了很大的成绩。运动的发展基本上是健康的。去年秋天以来的大发展，使全省合作化运动进入了一个新的阶段，出现了农业的社会主义改造运动的高潮。到今年六月底，全省共有农业生产合作社九万七千三百五十九个，入社农户二百七十四万一千四百多户，占总农户的百分之三十五点二。绝大部分农业生产合作社生产增加了，显示出它的优越性。为在全省范围内基本上实现合作化，大规模地发展农业生产，最后消灭农村资本主义创造了条件。中共河北省第四次代表会议在讨论合作化运动时，首先肯定了这一成绩。
    会议本着批评和自我批评的精神，揭发和批判了在发展农业合作化运动中的一些错误思想。例如：有的同志曾错误地认为：“农业生产合作社的发展太快了，超过了实际可能”，事实证明这是一种右倾思想。这种思想的产生，主要是由于过多地听了少数富裕农民的意见，忽视了广大贫苦农民走社会主义道路的积极性。中共河北省委在向会议所作的报告中指出：在这个伟大社会主义群众运动面前，由于对情况分析不够，把农业生产合作社发展中发生的一些问题估计得严重了一些，以至曾经一度摇摆犹疑。在今年四月发出的关于整顿农业生产合作社指示中，提出了集中力量全年进行整顿和巩固工作、坚决停止发展、并合理进行收缩的方针。这次代表会议认为：集中全力全年进行整顿和巩固是对的，对于一些本来不够建社条件，而勉强建立起来的社，以及被坏分子所操纵的社，合理的收缩，也是必要的、正确的。但是，坚决停止发展则是错误的。这一错误，在五月间经中央指出后，虽然省委已迅速予以纠正；但是，它的影响却不小，因而教训是十分深刻的。省委当时确定的今年发展数字，也只占全体农户的百分之八到百分之十。今天看起来，都显得太保守了。各个地委和县委的思想情况，也多是这样的。石家庄地委书记梁双璧同志在会上说：“在省委四月指示以后，我们是由看一看再说，进一步下了坚决停止发展的决心。六七月——即省委纠正了坚决停止发展的错误之后，我们也还只想个别发展，填填空白。看一看，表现了对发展社的犹疑；停止发展，就是裹足不前；填空白，个别发展，也还是裹足不前。”很清楚，这一错误指示直接影响了今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的准备工作。其次是使得有些地方把不应该收缩的社也收缩了，伤害了许多积极分子和贫苦农民的社会主义热情。
    河北省的农业生产合作社，是不是发展得太快，超过了实际可能，因而应该停止发展呢？事实自然完全不是这样。在这个问题上，听听农民——特别是广大贫苦农民的意见就会使大家的头脑清醒起来。中共顺义县委不分析具体情况，笼统地要求下边收缩时，当头就遇上了广大农民的反对。该县一区罗各庄的贫苦农民反映：“不发展社，还不就又要发展资本主义？”该县六区柯代子、苏宝珍领导的农业生产合作社中的贫农，拒绝区上由社转组的要求。会议指出：广大的农民期待我们去组织他们，而我们的某些同志却在那里裹足不前，畏首畏尾。在这样的情况下，还能说农业生产合作社发展得太快了吗？事实恰恰相反：是这些同志赶不上群众的要求，落在群众要求的后面了。
    河北省农业生产合作社的发展是否超过了实际可能呢？会议指出，抱有这种看法的同志，大多是从这样一种愿望出发。他们似乎觉得：一下子发展了这么多的社，由于没有经验，是否能把它巩固得下来呢？于是他们就进一步假想：发展得慢些，少些，也许容易巩固下来，容易达到增产，显示优越性。事实证明这是多余的忧虑，据今年六月底的统计，去冬今春农业生产合作社大发展以后，经过整顿，转为互助组和解散的只有八千多个，占原入社户数百分之八点五七，在整社过程中，根据群众要求，还建立了新社一千一百六十四个，增减相抵，实际减少户数仅占百分之七点三四。现有的近十万个社，有百分之八十增了产，显示了优越性。满城县七百一十四个社，就现在的情况看，有百分之九十八以上的社可以增产，有十四个社和单干农民相等，只有一个社低于单干农民。邢台县到今春入社户已占总农户的百分之六十六点四四，三个山区入社农户已达百分之八十以上，全县一百十二个乡有八十二个乡已合作化了，建社村庄已占全部村庄百分之九十四。邢台县农业生产合作社发展得这样快这样多，是不是就没法巩固了呢？事实上，经过积极整顿，大部分社巩固下来了。全县百分之八十以上的社都增了产，特别是山区的农业生产合作社，成绩更为显著。他们兴修水利，成滩修地，改良土质，提高农业技术，进行了许多个体农民所难以办到的生产改革。害怕社多了巩固不了的同志都忽视了最重要的一个情况，即：河北是老解放区，在农村中有着九十多万共产党员和广大的愿意走社会主义道路的贫苦农民，在历次政治运动中，又培养了大批的优秀工作人员。所有这一切，就是实现农业合作化最可靠的保证。
    会议指出：在发展农业生产合作社运动中，由于我们的同志缺乏经验，认真贯彻政策不够，的确曾经发生了一些偏差和错误。但这是属于前进中的缺点，因而也是不难加以改正的。半年来，河北省各地整顿的经验，也充分证明了这一点。就以耕畜和农具问题来说吧。有些经济基础较差、社员又缺乏集体经营生产习惯的农业生产合作社，由于过早地采取了牲畜、农具折价归社的办法，曾发生了一些问题。例如有些社员负债过多，一时情绪低落；草料缺乏，棚圈窄狭，又缺乏集体喂养经验，致有不少牲畜瘦弱或死亡。但是，当省委发觉并研究分析了这些情况，提出了一般新社应采取私有私喂由社租用或雇用的办法之后，许多原来在这方面问题较多的社，很快就得到了改正。这一事实说明，这些问题的发生，不是农业生产合作社发展太快的问题，而是由于有些同志没有认真执行自愿互利政策。
    会议明确指出了贫农是我党在农村中实现社会主义的政治支柱，依靠贫农是我党进行农业的社会主义改造运动中坚定不移的根本政策。只有依靠贫农，才能巩固地团结中农，办好农业生产合作社。在这个问题上，会议着重批判了某些同志的“现有贫农人数少，经济力量薄弱，无啥可依靠”的错误认识。会议指出，目前农村中生活仍然困难和不富裕的农民仍然占农村人口的多数，他们的社会主义积极性很高，依靠他们就能够实现农业的合作化。有些同志漠视那些在中农退社之后坚决要把社办下去的贫农，对他们不给以应有的积极的鼓励和支持。有的甚至错误地认为十户八户贫农坚持办下去的小社，农具少，牲畜又差，不像个样子。因而不是叫他们停办或转组，就是听之任之，叫他们孤军奋斗。会议指出：要办好农业生产合作社，就必须树立起贫农的政治优势，并在经济上给以必要的扶持，以发挥贫农在农业生产合作社中的中坚作用，同时巩固地团结中农。这是在目前我们还不可能改造农业装备的情况下，发挥贫、中农的劳动积极性，发掘劳力、土地及其他生产资料的潜力的主要方法和出路。
    此次会议最大的收获，是遵照中央最近关于农业生产合作社问题的指示，批判、纠正了很多同志的消极保守情绪。使许多同志由裹足不前转而认真地考虑、研究了本地区的具体情况，积极地去发展农业生产合作社，制定了先进的并符合实际情况的发展计划。会议根据中央指示和“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，确定：一方面认真地继续整顿和巩固现有的农业生产合作社，要求百分之九十的社达到增产；同时要求今冬明春发展新社两万五千至三万个，连原有的社共达十二万至十二万七千多个；要求增加入社农户占总农户的百分之十五左右，连原有入社户共达总农户的百分之五十左右。到一九五八年底，入社农户达到总农户的百分之八十以上，实现全省农业合作化。
