The Yunnan Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China has begun issuing poverty-stricken peasant cooperative fund loans on the eve of the great development of rural mutual aid and cooperation.

It is estimated that in Yunnan Province, poverty-stricken peasants participating in agricultural production cooperation this winter and next spring will account for 70% of the total number of households joining cooperatives. Among them, poverty-stricken peasant households with difficulties account for about 30%. The Provincial Agricultural Bank has issued more than 1.1 million yuan in poverty-stricken peasant cooperative fund loans to help them solve the difficulties of joining cooperatives. Among them, more than 590,000 yuan was lent to poverty-stricken peasants and new middle peasants with difficulties in economic crop areas such as Yuxi, Dali, Mengzi, and Chuxiong; more than 300,000 yuan was lent to poor farmers of various ethnic groups in mountainous areas of Wenshan, Simao, Lincang, and Qujing prefectures.

Rural credit cooperatives in various places have also combined the development of agricultural production cooperatives, depositing loans to mutual aid groups and individual farmers. The credit cooperative in Duanqi Township, Jinning County, has increased production funds for 117 farmers who had difficulty joining the cooperative by issuing loans. (Xinhua News Agency)

    云南发放贫农合作基金贷款
    中国农业银行云南省分行在农村互助合作大发展的前夕，开始发放贫农合作基金贷款。
    云南省今冬明春参加农业生产合作的贫农据估计将占入社总户数的百分之七十的贫农参加农业生产合作社，其中有困难的贫农户数约占百分之三十。省农业银行已发下一百一十多万元贫农合作基金贷款，帮助他们解决入社困难问题，其中有五十九万多元贷给玉溪、大理、蒙自、楚雄等经济作物区的贫农和有困难的新中农；有三十多万元贷给文山、思茅、临沧、曲靖等专区山区的各族贫困农民。
    各地农村信用合作社也结合农业生产合作社的发展，把存款贷给互助组和个体农民。晋宁县段旗乡的信用合作社通过发放贷款，使一百一十七户入社有困难的农民增加了生产资金。　（新华社）
