Do a Good Job in Setting Grain Production

According to the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" issued by the State Council, starting from 1955, in the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas, a system of combining purchase and sale, dividing surplus and deficit, unified arrangement, and management by voucher should be implemented on the basis of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale. This is an important measure to improve the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas. The experience of the unified purchase and sale of grain over the past two years has proved that in order to combine the unified purchase and sale well and clearly define the boundary between surplus and grain shortage, the grain output must be set reasonably, and production must be determined according to the actual output of farmers, rather than overestimating or underestimating the output. Only in this way can we ensure that grain purchase and sale are reasonable, thereby stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for production, increasing grain production even more, and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

The grain output assessed by the state for calculating the sales task of surplus grain households and the grain supply for grain-deficient households is different from the normal annual yield for agricultural tax collection. This is because the normal annual yield on which agricultural tax is levied in our country is still the one determined in 1952. In the past three years, due to the continuous development of agricultural production, this normal annual yield has been much lower than the actual output of farmland, and some even differ by 50% to 100%. The reason why the state has levied agricultural tax based on this output for several years is to actually reduce the burden on farmers, improve their lives, and encourage farmers to more actively increase grain and industrial raw material production. However, it would be inappropriate to carry out the unified purchase and sale of grain based on the normal annual yield determined three years ago for agricultural tax collection. Therefore, the state stipulates that grain output should be re-assessed in the unified purchase and sale of grain. This output should be based on the preliminary grain production figures distributed to the townships by the state before and after the spring plowing in 1955, combined with the fertility of each household's grain fields and various natural conditions, combined with the actual production and management of each household farmer, and evaluated by the township people's committees by mobilizing the masses, repeatedly deliberating, and conducting in-depth discussions. After it is passed by the township people's congress, it shall be submitted to the county-level people's committee or its designated agency for final approval. The grain production figures assessed in this way will become an important basis for the state to implement the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas.

Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out in his speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress: "Local governments are required to accurately estimate the grain output per mu, and the fixed output must not exceed the actual output." This is the guiding principle that must be followed in the work of setting grain production. Because only when the grain output is assessed accurately can the state determine the objects and quantities of unified purchase and sale according to the assessed grain output, minus the amount of grain that farmers should retain for their own use (including food grain, seeds, and feed) and the actual public grain paid, distinguishing between surplus, insufficient, and self-sufficiency. If the output is set too high or too low, it will affect the burden of sales tasks for surplus grain households and the reasonable supply for grain-deficient households. We know that if the sales task of surplus grain households is too heavy, the food and feed left for farmers will be too little; if their sales task is too light, the state's established unified purchase plan will fall short, affecting the supply of grain needed for national construction and people's lives. At the same time, if the supply to grain-deficient households is too much, it will not only lead to waste and excessive consumption of state grain resources, but also make other farmers feel unreasonable and unfair; if the supply is too little, the needs of truly grain-deficient households will not be met, thus affecting their production and lives. In short, the consequences caused by inaccurate output will damage the correct implementation of the grain unified purchase and sale policy and damage farmers' enthusiasm for production.

The provisions on fixed production in the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" fully embody the state's policy spirit of encouraging farmers to work hard and increase production. First, it specifically defines the standards for fixed production, so that the assessed output can conform to reality. The measures stipulate that grain fields with normal harvests this year should have their production fixed according to their actual output; grain fields that have encountered bumper harvests or disaster years this year should not have their production fixed according to this year's actual output because their output is not the harvest under normal years, but must have their production fixed according to the output that this grain field can achieve under normal years. In areas where production has been assessed last year, if the assessed output is roughly the same as this year's actual output, in order to save manpower and time, it is not necessary to re-assess production, and the output assessed last year can be used as a basis to appropriately adjust its high or low parts, and then assess the grain output. The output assessed based on such a realistic principle will provide a more realistic basis for the state to calculate the sales tasks of surplus grain households and the supply for grain-deficient households. Second, the measures stipulate that the normal annual output per unit area of grain fields assessed this year will remain unchanged for three years, which means that until 1957, the state will fix the assessed grain field output, and at the same time fix the quantity of grain unified purchase according to the fixed production figures. From a national perspective, assuming that the actual grain output in 1957 reaches the production target of 385.6 billion jin stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, and the actual grain output this year also reaches 360.8 billion jin of the planned output, that is to say, the output in 1957 will increase by 24.8 billion jin compared with 1955, but the grain fixed production figure in 1957 will still be fixed according to this year's output, implementing the principle of increasing production without increasing purchase. In addition, in order to encourage farmers to reclaim wasteland, the measures also stipulate that the reclaimed wasteland will not be counted in production within three years from the year of harvest, and the state will not stipulate unified purchase tasks. All the grain harvested by farmers from wasteland reclamation will be used by themselves. In this way, the surplus grain that farmers can dispose of themselves after completing the unified purchase task will become more and more, and at the same time, farmers will be able to better arrange their own production and lives. In this way, the vast number of farmers will inevitably be more active and enthusiastic in increasing grain production and selling surplus grain to the state.

The "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" also make clear provisions for the fixed production of grain-deficient households that produce grain. With the development of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation, grain output will gradually increase year by year, and the number of grain shortages among rural residents will inevitably decrease year by year. Therefore, the state can reduce their supply year by year. In order to adapt to the trend of year-by-year reduction of grain-deficient households, the measures stipulate that the grain field output of grain-deficient households should be assessed once a year. This is to use the normal annual output of grain fields of grain-deficient households as a base, plus the planned production increase target for each year, as the output for that year. For example, if a farmer has a total of ten mu of grain fields and the normal annual output is assessed as 3,000 jin, and the planned production increase for 1956 is 5%, then the output for 1956 should be 3,150 jin. The measures also stipulate that if the actual output exceeds the production increase target due to intensive cultivation, processing, and fertilization, the part exceeding the production increase target will not be included in the output for that year. From this, it can be seen that the state's provisions on the fixed production of grain fields for grain-deficient households that produce grain embody both the principle of reasonable supply to grain-deficient households and the spirit of encouraging grain-deficient households to increase production. Grain-deficient farmers should work diligently and gradually increase the output of their grain fields, striving to become self-sufficient households or surplus grain households from grain-deficient households.

In order to appropriately expand the area of ​​technical crops under the condition of not affecting grain production, to meet the needs of industrial raw material supply and export, the state also stipulates that the grain output of grain-deficient farmers who plant technical crops according to the state plan will also remain unchanged for three years after assessment. This provides a more definite guarantee for the grain supply of farmers who plant technical crops, and they are more at ease in increasing the output of technical crops.

As mentioned above, fixed production is the most important task in implementing the "three fixes" grain method. Whether the fixed production work is done well is directly related to the correct implementation of the grain unified purchase and sale policy. Therefore, every farmer should correctly recognize the consistency of national interests and individual interests, and assist the government in doing a good job in fixed production when carrying out the "three fixes" work. Every agricultural cooperative and every farmer must truthfully report their grain field output based on facts, and must not conceal output or deliberately lower output. Grassroots workers in rural areas should correctly implement the state's policies, and work with the work groups sent by higher-level governments to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to do a good job in fixed production.

    做好粮食定产工作
    李思恒
    根据国务院发布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”的规定，从一九五五年起，在农村粮食统购统销中，要在定产、定购、定销的基础上实行购销结合、划分余缺、统一安排、凭证管理的制度。这是改善农村粮食统购统销工作的重要措施。两年来的粮食统购统销工作的经验证明，要想把统购统销工作结合得好，余粮缺粮的界限划分得明确，就必须把粮食产量定得合理，必须按农民的实际产量定产而不要高估或低估产量。只有这样，才能保证粮食购销合理，从而激发农民的生产积极性，更多地增产粮食，并进一步巩固工农联盟。
    国家为计算余粮户交售任务和对缺粮户的粮食供应量而核定的粮食产量，跟农业税征收方面的常年应产量，是不同的。因为目前我国征收农业税所依据的常年应产量，还是一九五二年所查定下来的，三年以来，由于农业生产的不断发展，这个常年应产量已比农田的实际产量要低很多，有的甚至相差五成到一倍。几年来国家所以要依据这个产量来征收农业税，是为了要在实际上减轻农民的负担，改善农民的生活，并鼓励农民更积极地增产粮食和工业原料。但是要依照三年前确定的农业税征收方面的常年应产量来进行粮食统购统销，可就不合适了。因此，国家才规定要在粮食统购统销中重新核定粮食的产量。这个产量要以一九五五年春耕前后国家初步分配到乡的粮食定产数字为基础，根据每户粮田的肥瘠程度和各种自然条件，结合每户农民生产经营的实际情况，由乡人民委员会发动群众，反复酝酿，深入讨论，加以评定，然后经乡人民代表大会通过，报送县级人民委员会或其指定机关最后核定。经过这样评定的粮食定产数字，就成为国家在农村中实行粮食统购统销的重要依据。
    陈云副总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中曾经指出：“要求各地方政府对于地亩的粮食产量必须估得确实，定产不准超过实际产量”，这就是粮食定产工作必须遵循的方针。因为只有粮食产量核定得确实，国家才能根据所核定的粮食产量，减去农户应该留下的用粮量，（包括口粮、种籽、饲料）和实缴公粮之后，分别其有余、不足和不余不缺等不同情况，来划分农村的余粮户、缺粮户和自足户，从而决定进行统购统销的对象和数量。产量如果定得偏高或偏低，都会影响到余粮户交售任务的轻重，也会影响到对缺粮户的合理供应。我们知道，如果余粮户的交售任务过重，就会使农民留的口粮、饲料过少；如果他们的交售任务过轻，又会使国家既定的统购计划落空，影响国家建设和人民生活所需粮食的供应。同时，如果对缺粮户的供应量过多，不仅会招致浪费，过多地消耗国家粮食资源，而且会使其他农户感到不合理、不公平；如果供应量过少，又会使真正缺粮户的需要得不到满足，因而影响他们的生产和生活。总之，由于定产不实而导致的后果，都会损害粮食统购统销政策的正确贯彻，都会损害农民的生产积极性。
      “农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”中关于定产的规定，充分体现了国家鼓励农民勤劳增产的政策精神。首先，它具体地确定了定产的标准，使核定的产量可以符合实际。办法规定，凡是今年收成正常的粮田，就应该按它的实际产量定产；凡是今年遇到丰收或灾歉年景的粮田，由于它的产量并不是正常年景下的收成，所以就不应该按照今年的实际产量定产，而必须按照这块粮田在正常年景下所能达到的产量来定产。凡是去年已经评过产量的地区，如果所评定的产量同今年的实际产量大致差不多，为了节省人力和时间，就不必重新定产，可以拿去年评定的产量作基础，适当调整它偏高偏低的部分，然后来核定粮食产量。根据这样实事求是的原则来核定的产量，就会使国家计算余粮户的交售任务和缺粮户的供应量，有比较切合实际的根据。其次，办法规定，今年核定的粮田单位面积常年产量三年不变，就是说，一直到一九五七年，国家把经过核定的粮田产量固定下来，同时把粮食统购数量也根据定产数字固定下来。从全国来说，假定一九五七年粮食实际产量达到了五年计划规定的产量指标三千八百五十六亿斤，而今年的粮食实际产量，也达到了计划产量的三千六百零八亿斤，就是说一九五七年比一九五五年增产二百四十八亿斤，但一九五七年的粮食定产数字还是按照今年的产量来定，贯彻增产不增购。另外，为了鼓励农民垦荒，办法还规定，所垦荒地从开始收获那年起，三年内不计产量，国家也不规定统购任务。农民开荒而收获的粮食，全部归自己使用。这样，农民完成统购任务后归自己处理的余粮就会越来越多，同时农民也就能够更好地安排自己的生产和生活，这样，广大农民必然会更积极更热情地增产粮食和出卖余粮给国家。
    “农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”对于生产粮食的缺粮户的定产，也作了明确规定。随着农业生产和互助合作的发展，粮食产量将逐年有所增加，农村居民缺粮的数量必然会逐年减少，因此国家可以逐年减少对他们的供应量。为了适应缺粮户逐年减少的趋势，办法规定，对缺粮户的粮田产量每年评定一次。这就是以缺粮户的粮田常年产量为基数，加上每年计划增产指标，作为当年产量。例如某农户共有十亩粮田，常年产量核定为三千斤，一九五六年计划增产百分之五，则一九五六年的产量应为三千一百五十斤。办法还规定如果由于精耕细作、加工加肥，而使实际产量超过增产指标的，超过增产指标的这一部分，并不计入当年产量。从这里可以看到，国家对生产粮食的缺粮户的粮田定产的规定，是既体现了对缺粮户合理供应的原则，也体现了鼓励缺粮户增产的精神。缺粮农民应该勤劳耕作，逐年提高自己的粮田产量，争取由缺粮户变成自足户或余粮户。
    国家为了在不影响粮食增产的条件下，适当扩大技术作物的面积，满足工业原料的供应和出口的需要，还规定了按照国家计划种植技术作物的缺粮农户，他们的粮食产量核定后也三年不变。这就使种植技术作物的农户在粮食供应上得到更确切的保证，他们更加安心地提高技术作物的产量。
    上面已经说过，定产是贯彻粮食“三定”办法的头一样重要的工作，定产工作做得好不好，直接关系着粮食统购统销政策的正确贯彻。因此，每个农民都应该正确地认识国家利益和个人利益的一致性，在进行“三定”工作时，协助政府把定产工作做好。每一个农业合作社、每一个农户都必须实事求是地实报自己的粮田产量，而不要隐瞒产量或故意压低产量。农村中的基层工作人员应该正确地执行国家的政策，同上级政府派来的工作组一道，发动群众，依靠群众，把定产工作做好。
