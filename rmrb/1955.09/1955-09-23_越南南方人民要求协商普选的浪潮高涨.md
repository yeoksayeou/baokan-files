Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 21st: According to the Vietnam News Agency, since the large-scale strikes and market boycotts that erupted in Tu Lun, Quang Nam Province on August 21st, the calls for general elections in Quang Nam Province and Thua Thien Province to the north have become even louder.

　　In almost all villages in three counties of Quang Nam Province, leaflets were distributed and slogans were posted, condemning the terror measures taken by the South Vietnamese authorities and demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities hold consultative conferences with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to prepare for general elections. Mass rallies were held in many places, and the people expressed their will for national unity through appeals.

　　According to incomplete figures, residents of Tu Lun have already signed nearly two thousand appeals demanding consultative general elections. In Hoa Vang County, Quang Nam Province, 20,000 people (one-quarter of the county's total population) have signed more than 190 appeals. Residents of Dien Ban County have sent more than 2,000 appeals to the International Supervisory and Control Commission and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, demanding that the two regions of Vietnam conduct consultations to achieve national unity.

　　The attitude of the people has greatly affected the morale of personnel in the Ngo Dinh Diem government and army. Some personnel of the Ngo Dinh Diem government in certain counties and towns have fled to Hue, and some of them have resigned. In one county of Thua Thien Province, a large number of members of the so-called "Committee for Reporting Communists" also resigned. They said: "The people have expressed their love and admiration for the Communists and refuse to report them."

    越南南方人民要求协商普选的浪潮高涨
    新华社河内二十一日讯　据越南通讯社报道，自从八月二十一日在广南省土伦爆发的大罢工、大罢市以后，广南省和北面的承天省人民要求普选的呼声更加高涨了。
    广南省有三个县份几乎所有的村庄中，都散发了传单，贴起了标语，谴责南越当局所采取的恐怖措施，要求南越当局同越南民主共和国政府举行协商会议准备普选。在许多地方都举行了群众集会，人民通过呼吁书表达了他们要求国家统一的意志。
    根据不完全的数字，土伦的居民已经在将近两千份要求举行协商普选的呼吁书上签了名。在广南省的和荣县，有两万人（占该县居民总数四分之一）在一百九十多份呼吁书上签了名。殿盘县居民已经向国际监督和监察委员会和吴庭艳当局发出两千多份呼吁书，要求越南两个地区进行协商以实现国家的统一。
    人民的态度对吴庭艳政府和军队中的人员们的士气起了很大的影响。某些县和村镇中的吴庭艳政府的一些人员逃到了顺化，其中有些人提出了辞职。在承天省一个县中，所谓“告发共产党委员会”中的大批委员也辞了职。他们说：“人民表示他们热爱和敬佩共产党人，并且拒绝告发他们。”
