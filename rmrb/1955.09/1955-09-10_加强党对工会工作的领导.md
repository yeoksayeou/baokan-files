    The successful completion of the state's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and the Party's general task during the transition period depends on the conscious efforts of the people of the whole country, especially the working class. The continuous improvement of the consciousness and organization of the working class and the people of the whole country is the fundamental guarantee for winning the victory of the socialist revolution. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen the Party's ties with the people, especially with its own class—the working class, and further strengthen the Party's work among the working masses.

    The Party's connection with the working class masses is mainly realized through the trade union, the most extensive mass organization of workers voluntarily combined. Under the people's democratic regime, the trade union is the organization of the leading class of the country. It is a school, a school for workers to learn management, a school for presiding over the economy, and a school for communism. It is the most important social pillar of the people's democratic regime. The Party must strengthen its leadership over the trade union, give full play to the role of the trade union organization, so that through the work of the trade union, the working class will become a more organized, conscious, and cultured class, and unite it more closely around the Party.

    China's modern workers' movement developed under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party after its birth. China's trade union organizations have been powerful assistants to the Party in various historical periods of the revolution. After the national liberation, China's trade union work also developed rapidly with the development of the country's construction cause, and it has played a great role in the restoration and development of the national economy and various social reform movements. These achievements of the trade union are inseparable from the leadership and supervision of the Party's organizations at all levels and the support of the administrative departments of enterprises. In the struggle for socialist construction and socialist transformation, the role of trade unions will become increasingly important. However, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the current trade union work, and its connection with the masses is not very close, so it cannot meet the requirements of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    The Party's organizations at all levels generally attach importance to the leadership of trade union work. However, due to the insufficient understanding of the tasks and roles of trade unions during the transition period by some Party organizations and economic organizations, the insufficient implementation of the Party's idea of trusting the people and relying on the working class, and the lack of experience in leading trade union work in many Party organizations, the Party's leadership over trade union work is generally weak. Many Party organizations, especially the grassroots organizations of enterprises, have taken over many affairs, and abandoned or relaxed political work and ideological leadership over trade unions. Some Party organizations and administrative departments in enterprises have little difference in their work. This situation must be improved. Improving the Party's work in factories and mines, and closely combining political work with economic work, is an urgent problem to be solved in factories and mines, and strengthening the Party's leadership over trade unions is one of the most important aspects of strengthening the Party's political work.

    At present, strengthening the Party's leadership over trade union work should pay attention to the following issues:

    First, we must strengthen the Party's leadership over labor competitions. Labor competition is a method of relying on the masses and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to improve labor productivity, and high labor productivity is the main condition for consolidating and developing the new social system. Organizing labor competitions is the cause of the whole Party. The Party should organize competitions through trade unions, and educate all Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to actively participate in the competitions. In the process of the competition, the Party must also correctly organize the cooperation between the enterprise administration, the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and unify their work steps.

      The enthusiasm of the masses in production is determined by the degree of consciousness and organization of the masses. Therefore, the Party organizations in enterprises must strengthen the education of current affairs and policies and communist education for workers and staff, strengthen the internationalist education for workers and staff, and through labor competitions, carry out mass criticism and self-criticism, and educate the masses to treat labor, public property, and every comrade with a communist attitude.

    The goal of labor competition is to ensure the comprehensive completion and strive to over fulfill the various indicators of the national economic plan, such as output, quality, cost, product variety, and labor productivity. The way to achieve this goal, in addition to constantly giving play to and maintaining the high labor enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, is mainly to improve production technology, improve the technical proficiency of the workers, and improve production organization and labor organization. Therefore, the Party organizations in enterprises must pay close attention to the cultural and technical education of the workers, pay attention to the promotion of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the effective advanced experience of our country, and support the rationalization proposals of the masses. At the same time, signing collective contracts and organizing mass production meetings are important tasks for organizing labor competitions, and should gradually become a regular system in enterprises. Party organizations must use trade unions to carry out these tasks and help trade unions solve various difficulties in their work.

    The principle of material encouragement must be implemented in labor competitions. The wage system of pay according to work and various reasonable material reward systems can make the workers care about their labor achievements and the improvement of labor productivity from the perspective of personal material interests. This is the economic law of socialism. The principle of pay according to work and material encouragement embodies the consistency of personal interests and national interests, and the consistency of personal interests and national interests is an important factor in promoting the continuous development of socialist production. Therefore, the wage and reward system must be rectified, and material encouragement must be combined with political education, and material encouragement must be raised to the political level to educate the masses, so as to continuously improve the consciousness of the masses, and continuously give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers.

    Second, the Party must use trade union organizations to consolidate labor discipline. Labor discipline is the main symbol of the political consciousness and organization of the liberated working class, and is a necessary condition for building socialism. Without strict labor discipline, it is impossible to establish and maintain production order, and it is impossible to ensure the continuous improvement of labor productivity. The act of destroying labor discipline is a reflection of non-working class ideology in the working class ranks. Therefore, consolidating labor discipline is an important task for the entire historical period.

    It should be pointed out that in the past two years, there has been some progress in labor discipline in factories and mines, but the situation of lax labor discipline in some factories and mines is still serious. It is serious that the leading cadres of enterprises do not take concrete measures to complete the state plan on schedule and in an all-round way, and the phenomenon that employees violate operating procedures and safety regulations. Therefore, the Party organizations at all levels must, according to the specific situation, urge the trade union organizations to conduct labor discipline education frequently and repeatedly, and conduct continuous struggle against all phenomena that undermine labor discipline.

    In order to consolidate labor discipline, compulsory measures should be taken for a small number of workers who repeatedly violate labor discipline and refuse to be reformed after repeated education. Appropriate sanctions should be given to these workers, even dismissal from the factory. However, solid labor discipline can only be established on the basis of mass awareness, and the fundamental method of consolidating labor discipline must be persuasion and education. The punishment of a small number of workers must also be supported by the majority of workers, and such punishment must have a positive educational effect on the majority of workers. All simple and crude methods cannot truly consolidate labor discipline, but will alienate us from the masses, and will make the masses sympathize with the few who violate labor discipline and are punished. Therefore, the tendency of punishmentism must be prevented and opposed.

    In order to consolidate the labor discipline of the workers, the responsible persons of the factory and mine administration and the responsible persons of the Party and trade union must strictly abide by the labor discipline. The responsible persons of factories and mines must not put themselves outside the scope of the labor discipline that should be observed, and the responsible persons who violate labor discipline should also be punished.

    Third, the Party must use trade union organizations to regularly understand the living conditions and ideological conditions of the workers, understand the emotions and requirements of the workers, and warmly care for the material and cultural life of the workers. Of course, because China's industrial production is still very backward, the country must concentrate its main efforts to establish the foundation of national industrialization for a considerable period of time, so it should never leave the foundation of developing production and demand to improve the material and cultural life of the workers too hastily, too quickly, and too highly. It is necessary to emphasize the spirit of hard struggle, thrift and simplicity, strict economy, and overcoming difficulties among the broad masses of workers, especially in all leading organs and cadres. But if it is considered that concentrating the main force on developing production and practicing strict economy can not care about the lives of the masses, that is also extremely wrong. Only by warmly caring for the masses and gradually improving the lives of the masses on the basis of developing production can the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses be brought into full play to complete the task of national socialist industrialization.

    While studying production, the Party organizations at all levels must regularly study the living problems of the workers, and through the government, enterprise administration, trade unions and other relevant parties, solve the problems existing in the lives of workers that should be solved and can be solved in a timely manner. For the living problems related to the broad masses of workers, an enterprise or a place cannot solve them alone, and those that must be solved uniformly nationwide should make suggestions to the higher Party committee and the central government. For problems that cannot be solved for a while, they should also be explained to the masses in a timely manner, and bureaucratic attitudes of ignoring or delaying decisions should never be adopted. The Party organizations at all levels should supervise the commercial and cooperative departments and other living supply departments and cultural departments to better serve the material and cultural life of the workers; and through the Party organizations and trade union organizations, check the use of various funds related to workers' welfare allocated by the state by the enterprise administration, check the various collective welfare undertakings and cultural undertakings held by the trade unions; guide the trade unions to correctly use labor insurance funds, cultural and educational funds, membership hardship subsidies and other trade union funds; and run mutual savings funds well. Trade unions must make full use of these material conditions to better serve the material and cultural life of the workers and connect with the masses more closely. In private enterprises, the Party must, through trade unions, supervise capitalists, protect the legitimate rights and interests of the state and the workers according to the provisions of national laws, public-private contracts and labor-capital contracts.

    The Party organizations at all levels must attach great importance to the cultural and technical education of workers. If the working class does not have a certain level of culture, it is impossible to master modern and complex technologies, and it is impossible to smoothly build our country into a highly industrialized socialist country. However, the cultural and technical level of the workers in our country is still very low, which is a major difficulty in the current construction cause of our country. In order to change this situation, it is not only necessary to run regular spare-time primary schools well, but also to run spare-time middle schools, spare-time technical secondary schools and spare-time universities. This is a long-term and arduous cause that must be grasped from now on, and it should be done steadily without hesitation. In order to do this work well, the Party organizations at all levels must appropriately arrange various activities in the enterprise and strictly guarantee that the workers' spare-time study time is not encroached upon.

    Fourth, the Party organizations at all levels must pay attention to giving play to the role of trade union organizations in mass supervision of state organs and economic organs. This kind of bottom-up mass supervision by trade unions is absolutely necessary to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses and overcome bureaucracy in state organs and economic organs. Any idea or practice of canceling or weakening this mass supervision role of trade unions is wrong. This mass supervision role of the trade union organization system is an important aspect of expressing the role of trade unions as a social pillar of the people's democratic regime. At present, there are many serious phenomena of violation of laws and disciplines and corruption and waste in factories and enterprises, which have aroused dissatisfaction among workers and staff, and should be reflected to the central organs of the Party and the government from all aspects, and also from the trade union system, so as to be dealt with as soon as possible. Of course, the mass supervision of the trade union is carried out under the leadership of the Party, and is an important reliance on the supervisory role of the Party. At the same time, the various tasks of the trade union itself must also be placed under the strict supervision of the masses.

    Establishing a strict enterprise management system sufficient to unify the will and actions of tens of millions of people is necessary for large-scale industrial production. However, this management system must be established on the basis of the broad masses participating in production management, and must be combined with bottom-up mass supervision. We communists firmly believe in this irrefutable truth: no matter how smart and capable a leader is, he cannot surpass the wisdom of the masses; or in other words, their intelligence and ability depend on the results of the masses. For all the correct measures in the enterprise, the trade union should organize the masses to give full support and ensure their implementation. For the shortcomings and errors in the enterprise management, the trade union should support the criticism of the masses, and help and urge the administration to quickly correct them. For the phenomena of concealing accidents, burying assets, falsely reporting achievements, deceiving the country, and corruption and waste in some enterprises, the trade union should earnestly take responsibility, educate the masses to strengthen supervision, and conduct unremitting struggle. The Party and the state's supervisory organs should fully rely on trade union organizations to more effectively prevent and oppose the erosion of our state organs and economic organs by bourgeois ideology.

    In particular, a mass supervision system should be quickly established for labor protection and wage work in enterprises. Trade unions should supervise the enterprise administration to correctly implement the state's labor protection laws and regulations on safety technology, industrial hygiene, etc., correctly use the state's appropriations for improving the working conditions of workers, strictly disburse the wage fund correctly in accordance with the state plan, and correctly implement the wage system and use the enterprise reward fund.

    Fifth, the Party organizations at all levels must attach importance to the role of trade union organizations in the cause of socialist transformation. The Party organizations at all levels must regularly educate the workers on the worker-peasant alliance through trade unions, and the rural Party organizations must also regularly educate the peasants on the leading role of the working class and the Communist Party. At present, a certain number of state-owned farms and machine tractor stations have been established and will continue to be established in various regions. All state-owned farms and machine tractor stations should establish trade union organizations. The Party organization should pay attention to improving the political awareness of agricultural workers through these trade union organizations, ensuring the completion of the production plan, improving the production and management level of state-owned farms and machine tractor stations, setting a good example for the peasants, and strengthening their guidance work in rural areas.

    The Party organizations at all levels should pay attention to strengthening the political and ideological education of handicraft workers, guiding them to organize with handicraft laborers, participate in production cooperatives, and become the backbone for realizing the socialist transformation of handicrafts. This is also the most basic task of the handicraft trade union organization at present.

    Trade union organizations in capitalist industry and commerce should pay special attention to strengthening the class education of the workers, improving their class consciousness, and resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology. According to the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation, give full play to the supervisory role of the masses, cooperate with the management of state administrative organs and the leadership of the state-owned economy, so that capitalists abide by the country's policies and laws, improve business management, so as to prepare the conditions for joint state-private ownership, and gradually bring capitalist industry and commerce into the track of state capitalism. Trade union organizations in various forms of state capitalist enterprises should pay attention to relying on all workers, uniting and educating the original technical personnel and management personnel, giving play to their role in production, and improving the operation and management of the enterprise.

    Sixth, the Party organizations at all levels must also pay attention to the class purity of the working class and trade union organizations. The transition period is a period of extremely complex and acute class struggle. The class enemies at home and abroad are not reconciled to our victory and their failure, and they will inevitably carry out sabotage in all aspects more and more insidiously. Many facts have proved that class alien elements and counter-revolutionaries have already drilled into the ranks of the working class and trade union organizations in large numbers. They use the work posts they have stolen to create technical errors, create various accidents, and undermine the unity of the working class, thereby delaying the completion of the national plan and undermining the socialist construction cause. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically clean up the ranks of the working class and trade union organizations, mobilize the broad masses of workers and their families, and resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

    Seventh, the Party organizations at all levels should further strengthen the leadership of trade union organizations, so that all the work of the trade union follows the Party's policies and policies. However, the Party organization should not take over the specific affairs of the trade union, but should give play to the organizational role of the trade union, so that it can take the initiative and creatively carry out its work according to the Party's policies and policies. Only in this way can we enhance the combat effectiveness of trade union work.

    The Party's leadership over the trade union is realized through the Party organizations and Party members in the trade union organization. Therefore, the primary task of the Party's leadership over the trade union is to cultivate, select, and allocate cadres with organizational skills, who faithfully implement the Party's policies and closely connect with the masses (through mass elections) to engage in trade union work. The chairmen of trade unions at all levels should be Party member cadres who can participate in the Party committees at all levels as members. At the same time, some non-Party activists who have close ties with the masses should also be elected in a planned way to participate in the leadership work of the trade union, so as to strengthen the Party and non-Party alliance. Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League should actively participate in various social activities of the trade union and become the backbone of various activities. At present, many Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in enterprises do not participate in trade union activities, or even do not participate in trade union organizations, which is wrong.

    The Party organizations at all levels should help the trade union organization improve its work style, improve the democratic life and democratic system of the trade union, and closely connect the trade union with the workers.

    The Party's leadership and the support of the masses are the most essential conditions for the achievements of all trade union work. To implement the Party's and the state's policies among the masses, and to combine them with the masses' own demands and will, is the basic role of the trade union, which is the leading role of the Party's connection with the masses, the pillar role of the people's democratic regime, and the role of the communist school. For this reason, the basic method of trade union work must be persuasion and education. Trade union cadres must live among the masses, warmly care for the masses, establish close ties with the masses, accurately understand the emotions, opinions and demands of the masses, reflect the emotions, opinions and demands of the masses to the Party in a timely manner, and educate the masses according to the Party's instructions, improve the awareness of the masses, and strive to achieve the tasks put forward by the Party. To this end, it is necessary to promote democracy within the trade union, seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism, and attract and rely on the broad masses of activists to carry out work. At present, many trade union organizations still have undemocratic styles, do not pay attention to attracting and relying on the broad masses of activists to carry out work and other bad tendencies, which must be corrected under the leadership and supervision of the Party.

    The Party organizations at all levels should regularly listen to and discuss the work reports of the trade union, urge the trade union organizations at all levels to implement the resolutions and instructions of the higher trade union organizations and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and check their implementation of these resolutions and instructions. The Party organizations at all levels can put forward different opinions on the instructions of the higher-level trade union, but if they want to change the instructions of the higher-level trade union, they must be approved by the higher-level Party organization.

    加强党对工会工作的领导
    国家发展国民经济的第一个五年计划和党在过渡时期总任务的顺利完成，必须依靠全国人民群众、首先是工人阶级自觉的努力。工人阶级和全国人民觉悟程度和组织程度的不断提高，是取得社会主义革命胜利的根本保证。因此必须进一步加强党同人民群众、特别是同本阶级——工人阶级的联系，进一步加强党在职工群众中的工作。
    党同本阶级——工人阶级群众的联系，主要是通过工会这个职工群众自愿结合的最广泛的群众组织来实现的。在人民民主政权下的工会，是国家领导阶级的组织。它是一个学校，是工人们学习管理的学校，学习主持经济的学校，学习共产主义的学校。它是人民民主政权的最重要的社会支柱。党必须加强对于工会的领导，充分发挥工会组织的作用，以便通过工会的工作，使工人阶级更加成为一个有组织、有觉悟、有文化的阶级，并且更加紧密地把它团结在党的周围。
    我国现代的工人运动，是在中国共产党产生之后，在中国共产党直接领导下发展起来的。我国工会组织，在革命的各个历史时期都是党的有力的助手。全国解放以后，我国工会工作随着国家建设事业的发展也迅速地发展起来了，它在国民经济的恢复和发展以及各种社会改革运动中，都起了很大的作用。工会的这些成绩，和党的各级组织对它的领导、监督以及企业行政部门对它的支持是分不开的。在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的斗争中，工会的作用将愈益重要。可是，目前工会工作中还存在许多缺点和问题，它同群众的联系还不很紧密，因而它还不能适应社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业对它的要求。
    党的各级组织对工会工作的领导一般是重视的。但是，由于某些党组织和经济组织的干部对工会在国家过渡时期的任务和作用认识不足，对于党的信赖人民群众、依靠工人阶级的思想贯彻不够，加上很多党组织缺乏领导工会工作的经验，所以党对工会工作的领导一般还是薄弱的。许多党的组织特别是企业的基层组织，包揽了许多事务，而放弃了或放松了政治工作和对工会的思想领导，甚至有些企业单位的党组织和行政方面在工作上没有多大区别。这种情形必须加以改进。改进厂矿企业中党的工作，使政治工作同经济工作紧密结合，是目前厂矿企业中急待解决的一个问题，而加强党对工会的领导，则是加强党的政治工作的一个最重要的方面。
    目前，加强党对工会工作的领导，应注意以下几个问题：
    第一，必须加强党对劳动竞赛的领导。劳动竞赛是依靠群众、高度地发挥群众的积极性和创造性来提高劳动生产率的方法，而高度的劳动生产率是新社会制度赖以巩固发展的主要条件。组织劳动竞赛是全党的事业。党应当通过工会来组织竞赛，并且教育所有的党员和青年团员积极地参加竞赛。在竞赛过程中，党还必须正确地组织企业行政、工会和青年团之间的协作，统一它们相互之间的工作步调。
      群众在生产中的积极性是决定于群众的觉悟程度和组织程度的。因此，企业中的党组织必须加强职工的时事政策教育和共产主义教育，加强职工的国际主义教育，并且通过劳动竞赛，开展群众性的批评和自我批评，教育群众以共产主义态度来对待劳动、对待公共财产、对待每个同志。
    劳动竞赛的目标是保证全面完成和争取超额完成国民经济计划的产量、质量、成本、产品品种、劳动生产率等各项指标。达到这个目标的途径，除开经常地发挥和保持工人群众的高度的劳动积极性和创造性以外，主要是改进生产技术，提高职工群众的技术熟练程度，改进生产组织和劳动组织。因此，企业中的党组织就必须十分注意职工群众的文化、技术教育，注意推广苏联的先进经验和我国行之有效的先进经验，支持群众的合理化建议。同时，签订集体合同、组织群众生产会议，是组织劳动竞赛的重要工作，应该逐渐使它成为企业中的经常的制度。党组织必须运用工会来进行这些工作，并帮助工会解决工作中的各种困难。
    在劳动竞赛中必须贯彻物质鼓励的原则。按劳付酬的工资制度和各种合理的物质奖励制度，能使职工群众从个人物质利益上来关心自己的劳动成果和劳动生产率的提高，这是社会主义的经济法则。按劳付酬、物质鼓励的原则，体现着个人利益和国家利益的一致性，而个人利益和国家利益的一致正是推动社会主义生产不断发展的重要因素。因此，工资奖励制度必须加以整顿，必须使物质鼓励同政治教育相结合，把物质鼓励提高到政治上来教育群众，以不断地提高群众的觉悟程度，不断地发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性。
    第二，党必须运用工会组织巩固劳动纪律。劳动纪律是解放了的工人阶级政治觉悟和组织程度的主要标志，是建设社会主义的必要条件。没有严格的劳动纪律，就不可能树立和维持生产秩序，就不可能保证劳动生产率的不断提高，破坏劳动纪律的行为是非工人阶级思想在工人阶级队伍中的反映。因此，巩固劳动纪律是一个整个历史时期的重要任务。
    应该指出：近两年来，厂矿企业中的劳动纪律有一些进步，但是某些厂矿企业中的劳动纪律松弛的情况依然是严重的。企业领导干部不采取具体措施来按期地全面地完成国家计划，职工违反操作规程和安全规程的现象都是严重的。因此，党的各级组织必须根据具体情况，督促工会组织经常地反复地进行劳动纪律教育，同一切败坏劳动纪律的现象进行不断的斗争。
    为了巩固劳动纪律，对于少数一再违反劳动纪律、屡教不改的职工，应当采取强制的办法，对于这些职工应当给以适当的处分直至开除出厂。但是，巩固的劳动纪律只能是建立在群众自觉的基础上，巩固劳动纪律的根本方法必须是说服教育。对于少数职工的处分，也必须取得大多数职工的拥护，并使这种处分对大多数职工有积极的教育作用。一切简单粗暴的办法，都不可能使劳动纪律真正巩固起来，反而会使我们脱离群众，会使群众同情少数违反劳动纪律而受处分的分子。因此，惩办主义的倾向是必须防止和反对的。
    为了巩固职工群众的劳动纪律，厂矿企业行政的负责人员以及党和工会的负责人员必须严格地遵守劳动纪律。厂矿企业负责人员决不能把自己置于应该遵守的劳动纪律的范围以外，对于违反劳动纪律的负责人员是同样应该受到处分的。
    第三，党必须运用工会组织，经常了解职工群众的生活状况和思想状况，了解职工群众的情绪和要求，并且要热情地关怀职工群众的物质、文化生活。当然，由于我国工业生产还很落后，国家必须在相当长的时期内集中主要力量建立国家工业化的基础，因而决不应该离开发展生产的基础而过急、过快、过高地要求改善职工群众的物质、文化生活。必须在广大职工群众，特别是在所有领导机关和干部中，强调发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素、厉行节约、克服困难的精神。可是如果认为集中主要力量发展生产和厉行节约就可以不关心群众的生活，那也是极端错误的。只有热情地关怀群众，并使群众的生活在发展生产的基础上逐步有所改善，才能高度地发挥群众的积极性和创造性来完成国家社会主义工业化的任务。
    党的各级组织在研究生产的同时，必须经常地研究职工群众的生活问题，并通过政府、企业行政和工会等有关方面，及时地解决职工生活中所存在的应当解决而又可能解决的问题。对于有关广大职工群众的生活问题，一个企业一个地方无法单独解决，而必须在全国范围内统一解决者，应向上级党委和中央提出建议。对于一时无法解决的问题，也应该及时地向群众解释清楚，决不可以采取不闻不问或拖延不决的官僚主义态度。党的各级组织应监督商业、合作社部门和其他生活供应部门以及文化部门，更好地为职工群众的物质文化生活服务；并经过党的组织和工会组织检查企业行政方面对于国家拨付的各种有关工人福利的经费的使用情况，检查工会举办的各种集体福利事业和文化事业的情况；指导工会正确地使用劳动保险金、文化教育经费、会员困难补助费和其它工会经费；办好互助储金会。工会必须充分利用这些物质条件，更好地为职工的物质文化生活服务，更紧密地联系群众。在私营企业中，党必须通过工会，监督资本家，根据国家法令、公私合同和劳资合同的规定，保障国家利益和职工群众的正当权益。
    党的各级组织必须十分重视工人的文化教育和技术教育。工人阶级如果没有一定的文化水平，就不可能掌握现代的复杂技术，就不可能顺利地把我国建设成为一个高度工业化的社会主义国家。可是目前我国职工群众的文化水平和技术水平还是很低的，这是我国目前建设事业上的一个重大困难。为了改变这种情况，就不仅需要办好正规的业余小学，而且必须把业余中学、业余技术专科学校和业余大学也举办起来，这是从现在起就必须抓紧的一个长期的艰巨的事业，应该毫不迟疑地踏踏实实地做起来。为了做好这一工作，党的各级组织必须适当安排企业中的各种活动，严格地保障职工的业余学习时间不受侵占。
    第四，党的各级组织必须注意发挥工会组织对国家机关和经济机关的群众监督作用。工会的这种自下而上的群众监督，是发挥群众积极性，克服国家机关、经济机关中的官僚主义所绝对必需的，任何取消或削弱工会的这种群众监督作用的想法和做法都是错误的。工会组织系统的这种群众监督作用，就是表示工会是人民民主政权的社会支柱作用的一个重要方面。目前工厂企业中有不少违法乱纪和贪污浪费的严重现象，这些现象在工人职员群众中已经引起不满，应该从各方面，同时也从工会系统反映到党和政府的中央机关来，以便尽快地加以处理。当然，工会的群众监督是在党的领导之下进行的，是党的监督作用的一个重要的依靠，同时工会自己的各项工作，也必须放在群众的严格监督之下。
    建立足以统一千万人意志和行动的严格的企业管理制度是大工业生产所必需的，但是，这种管理制度必须建立在广大群众参加生产管理的基础上，必须是同自下而上的群众监督相结合的。我们共产党人坚信这条颠扑不破的真理：任何聪明干练的领导者个人，都不可能超越群众的智慧；或者说，他们的聪明干练正是依靠群众的结果。对于企业中一切正确的措施，工会要组织群众给以充分支持，并保证实现。对于企业管理中的缺点和错误，工会要支持群众的批评，并帮助和督促行政方面迅速改正。对于某些企业中存在的隐瞒事故、埋伏资财、虚报成绩、欺骗国家，以及贪污浪费等现象，工会应切实负起责任，教育群众加强监督，进行坚持不懈的斗争。党和国家的监察机关应该充分依靠工会组织，更有效地防止和反对资产阶级思想对我们国家机关和经济机关的侵蚀。
    对于企业中的劳动保护工作和工资工作，尤应迅速建立起群众监督制度。工会要监督企业行政正确执行国家有关安全技术、工业卫生等劳动保护法令，正确使用改善职工劳动条件的国家拨款，严格按照国家计划正确地开支工资基金，正确地执行工资制度和使用企业奖励基金。
    第五，党的各级组织必须重视工会组织在社会主义改造事业中的作用。党的各级组织必须通过工会经常地向职工群众进行工农联盟的教育，农村党的组织也要经常地向农民群众进行工人阶级和共产党的领导作用的教育。现在各个地区已经建立并将继续建立一定数量的国营农场和机器拖拉机站，所有的国营农场和机器拖拉机站，都应该建立工会组织。党组织应注意通过这些工会组织，提高农业工人的政治觉悟，保证生产计划的完成，提高国营农场和机器拖拉机站的生产管理水平，给农民群众树立起良好的榜样，并加强它们对农村的辅导工作。
    党的各级组织都应该注意加强对手工业工人的政治思想教育，引导他们同手工业劳动者一起组织起来，参加生产合作社，成为实现对手工业社会主义改造的骨干。这也就是手工业工会组织当前最基本的任务。
    资本主义工商业中的工会组织，应该特别注意加强职工群众的阶级教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟，抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀。根据利用、限制、改造的方针，充分发挥群众的监督作用，配合国家行政机关的管理和国营经济的领导，使资本家遵守国家的政策法令，改进经营管理，以准备公私合营的条件，逐步把资本主义工商业纳入国家资本主义的轨道。各种形式的国家资本主义企业中的工会组织，应注意依靠全体工人，团结教育原有的技术人员和管理人员，发挥他们在生产中的作用，改善企业的经营管理。
    第六，党的各级组织还必须注意工人阶级和工会组织的阶级纯洁性。过渡时期是一个阶级斗争异常复杂、尖锐的时期。国内外阶级敌人都不甘心于我们的胜利和他们的失败，他们必然要愈来愈阴险地从各方面来进行破坏。许多事实证明：阶级异己分子和反革命分子，已经大量地钻到工人阶级队伍和工会组织中来了。他们利用窃取到的工作岗位，制造技术错误，制造各种事故，破坏工人阶级团结，从而延误国家计划的完成，破坏社会主义建设事业。因此，必须有计划地清理工人阶级的队伍和工会组织，发动广大职工群众及其家属，坚决肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    第七，党的各级组织应该进一步加强对工会组织的领导，使工会的全部工作都遵循党的方针政策来进行。但是党组织不应当包办工会的具体事务，而是应当发挥工会的组织作用，使它根据党的方针政策主动地创造性地进行工作。只有这样才能增强工会工作的战斗性。
    党对工会的领导，是通过工会组织中的党组织和党员去实现的。因此，党领导工会的首要任务便是培养、挑选、配备有组织才能的、忠实执行党的政策并紧密联系群众的干部（经过群众选举）去从事工会工作。各级工会主席应该是能够参加各该级党委为委员的党员干部。同时，也应该有计划地选举一些同群众有密切联系的非党积极分子，参加工会的领导工作，以加强党和非党联盟。共产党员和青年团员都应积极参加工会的各种社会活动，成为各种活动的骨干。目前企业中有不少共产党员、青年团员不参加工会活动，甚至不参加工会组织，这是错误的。
    党的各级组织应帮助工会组织改进工作作风，健全工会的民主生活和民主制度，密切工会同职工群众的联系。
    党的领导和群众的支持，是工会全部工作获得成就的最本质的条件。把党和国家的政策贯彻到群众中去，使它同群众自己的要求和意志结合起来，是工会的基本作用，这也就是党同群众联系的引带作用、人民民主政权的支柱作用和共产主义学校的作用。正因为如此，所以工会工作的基本方法必须是说服教育。工会干部必须生活在群众之中，热情地关怀群众，同群众建立起亲密联系，正确无讹地了解群众的情绪、意见和要求，把群众的情绪、意见和要求及时地反映给党，并根据党的指示教育群众，提高群众的觉悟，为实现党提出的任务而奋斗。为此，就必须发扬工会内部的民主，认真开展批评和自我批评，吸引并依靠广大积极分子进行工作。目前有许多工会组织还有不民主的作风，不注意吸引和依靠广大积极分子进行工作等不良倾向，必须在党的领导和监督下加以纠正。
    党的各级组织应定期听取并讨论工会的工作报告，督促各该级工会组织执行上级工会组织及全国总工会的决议和指示，并检查他们执行这些决议指示的情况。党的各级组织对上一级工会的指示，可以提出不同的意见，但如果要改变上一级工会的指示，必须经过上级党组织的批准。
