    Guangdong Farmers Use Bird Guano from the Xisha Islands

    Guangdong Province farmers are using large quantities of bird guano from the South China Sea's Xisha Islands as fertilizer this year.

    The bird guano layer on the Xisha Islands is very thick, averaging 40 centimeters deep, and estimated to have reserves of hundreds of thousands of tons. Since the spring of this year, relevant departments in Guangdong Province have been mining it and transporting it back to various parts of the province for use as rice fertilizer. The fertilizer effect of this bird guano is better than chemical fertilizers and other fertilizers. Rice seedlings using this fertilizer are growing very well, and yields are increasing.

    The price of bird guano is relatively low, and farmers in various places are very welcome. In Hainan Island alone, more than 2,500 tons were sold by the end of July, and many farmers in the Pearl River Delta and Chaoshan Plain also purchased it. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东农民使用西沙群岛鸟粪
    广东省农民在今年大量使用南海西沙群岛上的鸟粪作肥料。
    西沙群岛上的鸟粪层堆积很厚，平均深达四十公分，估计积储量有几十万吨。今年春天以来，广东省有关部门在这个地方进行了开采，运回供省内各地作水稻肥料之用。这些鸟粪的肥效比化学肥料和其他肥料要好，使用这种肥料的稻苗长得很好，产量提高。
    鸟粪的价格较低廉，各地农民都很欢迎。仅海南岛一地到七月底就销售了二千五百多吨，其他珠江三角洲和潮汕平原的农民购用的也很多。（新华社）
