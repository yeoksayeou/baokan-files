    柴达木盆地一支钻井队提前完成全年任务
    新华社西宁十八日电　在柴达木盆地的青海石油探勘局地质钻井队，已提前三个月另十九天完成了今年的钻井任务。
    这支地质钻井队大都是青年职工。当全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会就要召开的消息传到各个井场时，青年职工纷纷表示要以自己的实际行动争取作一个社会主义建设的积极分子。
    九月五日，五零五小队创造了日进取芯七十八点七六公尺的新纪录；接着五零二小队又创造了日进取芯七十九点九八公尺的更高纪录。质量都超过了国家预定的要求。到十一日为止，全队已经提前三个月另十九天完成了今年国家交给的钻井任务。现在，这支钻井队又接受了新的任务，他们展开劳动竞赛，要争取超额完成百分之四十的增产任务。
    为了进一步激发全队青年的劳动热情，迎接大会的召开，钻井队的青年团组织曾吸收全体青年职工，参加了以“你拿什么实际行动来迎接大会的召开”为内容的团日活动。青年职工们并且给全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会写了一封决心书。他们在决心书中说：我们一定要在党的亲切教导下，继续团结全队职工，创造出更高的钻井纪录来作为向大会的献礼。
