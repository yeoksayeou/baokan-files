The task of China's youth in the struggle to implement the first five-year plan

Report to the National Conference of Young Socialists in Construction by the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China

Dear comrades!

This conference is a gathering of youth from all ethnic groups in our country, marching towards socialism. The Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China entrusts me to report to the conference and, on behalf of the Youth League Central Committee, extends warm congratulations to the 1,527 outstanding young activists from all fronts of our motherland.

The purpose of convening this conference is what? The resolution of the second plenary session of the second Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China clearly states: It is to further mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of youth across the country in socialist construction, to commend the contributions of young activists on various fronts to the motherland, and to propagate and promote their advanced experiences and excellent qualities to the youth of the entire country, so as to better mobilize the youth of the entire country to struggle for the liberation of Taiwan, to complete and strive to overfulfill the tasks of the first five-year plan for national economic development. Therefore, this conference will spend most of its time listening to your speeches. The Youth League Central Committee believes that you will surely report your contributions and experiences to the motherland and to the youth of the entire country, and your future efforts and plans. This conference will also discuss a very important issue, that is: How should our youth, together with the people of the entire country, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, struggle to complete and strive to overfulfill the first five-year plan of our motherland?

Everyone knows that at the second session of the first National People's Congress held in July, the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was adopted. Our party teaches us that the first five-year plan of our country is to lay a preliminary but solid foundation for our country's great socialist construction cause. The five-year plan represents the long-term interests of the people of our country as a whole. From the five-year plan, we see the boundless prosperity and happiness of our motherland, and in front of us, a broad field is opened up for us to display our talents and wisdom in many aspects. To use all our strength to complete and strive to overfulfill this plan is the most sacred task of the people and youth of our country.

Our party regards the young generation as a great shock force for the realization of the five-year plan and the construction of socialism. Why is it a great shock force? Because our country has 120 million young people, accounting for one-fifth of the total population and more than one-third of the labor force; because the youth not only have strong bodies and abundant energy, but also grow up under the nurturing of the Communist Party of China, can keenly perceive new things, and with ardent aspirations and the greatest courage, pursue the beautiful future of socialism for our motherland.

We believe that the youth of New China will not disappoint the party's expectations for us. All the youth of our country will say: For the great motherland, we will not hesitate to give our strength! However, having only promises is not enough to accomplish anything. If promises are not fulfilled with resolute actions, such promises are worthless.

Then, how should we act? The third plenary session of the second Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China held before this conference believes: According to the specific requirements of the country's first five-year plan, according to the special circumstances of the youth, and according to the current domestic and international environment of our country, the youth of the entire country should universally and actively mobilize for the following major tasks. These major tasks are: first, actively participate in the socialist industrial construction and agricultural cooperativization movement; second, study culture, master technology, and march towards science; third, enhance revolutionary vigilance and defend the socialist construction of our motherland.

Actively Participate in Socialist Industrial Construction and Agricultural Cooperativization Movement

The economic construction tasks of the first five-year plan are very arduous. The prosperity of the motherland must rely on decisive victories on the economic construction front. Everyone knows that the first five-year plan is to lay the preliminary foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country. Within five years, 2,994 industrial units will be completed and newly built or expanded, and the total industrial output value will be nearly doubled compared to 1952; approximately 10,000 kilometers of railways and more than 10,000 kilometers of highways will be added. The first five-year plan is to lay the preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture. By 1957, the total output value of agriculture and sideline products will be nearly one-quarter higher than in 1952. Within five years, in addition to building 13 large-scale reservoirs, the excavation of river channels will total 13 billion cubic meters of soil and stone; 90 million mu of forest land will be afforested; the great project of controlling the Yellow River will also begin. Within five years, efforts will be made to organize the handicraft industry and establish the preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of the handicraft industry. Within five years, the capitalist and commercial industries will be basically integrated into various forms of state capitalism, establishing the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industries. Achieving the above, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our country will reach 124.99 billion yuan, an increase of more than 51% compared to 1952. To achieve this grand plan, the state will invest 76.64 billion yuan, equivalent to 70 million taels of gold. This is a huge sum. To accumulate this huge sum and to complete and strive to overfulfill the five-year plan, the party calls on us to launch a comprehensive and sustained production and savings movement. This production and savings movement is related to everyone on every post in the country. Youth standing on various fronts of the state's undertakings should actively participate in this movement.

Everyone knows that the 76.64 billion yuan of investment in the first five-year plan is used in industry and transportation, and postal and telecommunications services, amounting to 40.31 billion yuan, accounting for 52.6%. Industry, especially heavy industry, is the foundation of the motherland's prosperity. Therefore, the youth, who account for half of the total workforce of 4.5 million people on the fronts of basic construction, geological exploration, factory and mine enterprises, and transportation, bear a very heavy responsibility for the state's socialist industrialization cause and must actively participate in labor competitions and stand at the forefront of the production and savings movement.

How should the youth on this front strive for production and savings?

First of all, everyone must work diligently. Among some of our young workers, there is such a view that only certain managers have wasteful behavior, and waste has nothing to do with me, which is incorrect. Let everyone calculate this account: if the 4.5 million young workers on this front each miss one day of work per year, and the average value produced by each person per day is only 5 yuan, then the state will lose 22.5 million yuan per year. Therefore, every young worker must have the concept that not working hard, being absent without reason, producing defective products, and carelessly damaging machinery and tools are all great waste. Those who have always been honest and diligent in their work are our labor models and labor heroes. Such respected model producers are emerging continuously. For example, Qi Changyuan from Dalian has not been absent from work since 1947, has not violated labor discipline even once, has not produced any defective products since 1948, and has not lost or damaged any tools. The steam turbine operator Quan Ganglu from the Weishui Power Plant in Hebei has always paid attention to operating procedures and created a new record of 2,220 days of safe power generation. On this front, every young comrade should model exemplary labor discipline, strive to be absent without reason, not produce defective products, take care of machinery and tools, and not have any accidents.

Our country has always advocated creative labor, which can break people's outdated and conservative ideas and greatly improve labor productivity. During the period of national economic recovery, many creative advanced producers and workers emerged. Since the implementation of the five-year plan, such comrades have appeared even more. Young lathe operator Wang Chonglun created the universal tool holder, young lathe operator Chen Xiulin created the "water tank radiator automatic assembly machine," young carpenter Gu Siren created the multi-blade planer, fine spinning worker Wu Guiyun reduced the skin roller flower rate to 0.098%, and the young drilling team in the Qaidam Basin completed this year's drilling task 110 days ahead of schedule. Needless to say, if we add up all the small and large inventions and creations of young people across the country, the wealth created for the state is quite considerable. More and more young workers hope to become such advanced producers and workers, which is, of course, a good phenomenon. But creative labor must be based on skilled labor. Some of our comrades have not taken a serious attitude towards this matter. When they are not yet proficient in basic operating techniques and have not yet acquired basic scientific knowledge, they are eager to achieve success and want to make a surprising invention and creation at once, resulting in not only failing to complete the production task but also violating operating procedures, damaging machinery and tools, and affecting the completion of the plan. This is, of course, extremely detrimental to the state. Therefore, young comrades on this front should also strive to learn technology, improve operating skills, and increase scientific knowledge, so as to accurately complete the work schedule and ensure the quality of work, and together with all the workers, comprehensively and evenly complete the state's plan; on this basis, they should then study hard, together with everyone, and purposefully improve technology, continuously improve labor productivity.

Since the establishment of the first youth shock brigade on the construction site of the capital's Soviet Exhibition Hall in January 1954, the organization of youth shock brigades has gradually developed on construction sites across the country, and then many other factories and mines have imitated this method, establishing advanced youth teams and groups. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 1,597 youth shock brigades nationwide in basic construction sites and factories and mines, with 31,518 participants; according to statistics from 24 provinces and cities, there are 2,317 advanced youth teams and groups, with 30,842 participants. These shock brigades and advanced teams and groups, under the leadership and care of the party, administration, and trade unions, have mostly excelled in completing various tasks. Experience has proven that this advanced production organization, which does not disrupt the overall production organization and is under unified administrative management, is not only a good form to inspire young activists to take the lead in improving production efficiency, breaking labor quotas, and ensuring the completion of urgent tasks, but also a good way to influence and educate the broad masses of young workers to consolidate labor discipline, promote unity and mutual assistance, and strive to overcome difficulties. We should all cherish it. How should we cherish this young thing that has not yet grown up? First, all shock brigades and advanced teams and groups should pay attention to criticism and self-criticism at all times, strengthen unity, learn from the surrounding masses at all times, not be arrogant, not be complacent, and strive to make progress. Second, units that have already established such advanced organizations should continue to consolidate and develop these organizations. Some places have already implemented the system of regularly convening meetings of the leaders of these organizations, exchanging experiences, and inspecting work, which has a great role in helping these organizations to consolidate and develop, and should be promoted. Third, in units that do not yet have such advanced organizations, active efforts should be made to discover and cultivate activists and establish them in a planned manner, so as to use specific advanced examples to drive the broad masses of young people forward. Fourth, for those few organizations that were hastily established but cannot play an advanced role, they must be rectified and strengthened in education to ensure that no advanced organization becomes a mere name and tarnishes the reputation of the entire advanced organization. In short, we should make the youth shock brigades and youth advanced teams and groups develop steadily and healthily and become a great force for promoting the production and savings movement.

Saving raw materials is a broad path for us to increase the wealth of the state. Let me give two examples. The first example: The youth savings team of the forge workshop of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works initiated an activity to save materials by using scrap materials instead of good materials without increasing working hours and ensuring product quality. From January to May this year, they have already used scrap materials to replace 8,600 kg of good materials, producing 28,774 finished products, creating 10,900 yuan of wealth for the state. To welcome the National Conference of Young Socialists in Construction, they unanimously decided to produce 67,952 finished products with scrap materials in the second half of this year, saving 18,597 kg of good iron for the state, worth 8,000 yuan. The second example: The locomotive driver Sun Shiguang of the Angang Locomotive Section created the "fast fire-burning method," reducing the cost of his locomotive by about 30% in completing transportation tasks. The "fast fire-burning method" has been promoted nationwide after being promoted on the railways, saving a large amount of fuel for the state. It is estimated that at least 2.4 million tons of coal will be saved in 1955, accounting for 4% of the total fuel consumption of the national railways for the whole year. Therefore, we should not underestimate any achievement in saving raw materials. Every worker should pay attention to saving every bit in their daily work, and when combined, it can create a large amount of wealth for the state. Now, many young workers in factories and mines have put forward practical proposals for saving raw materials and launched a mass activity to save raw materials. To promote the production and savings movement, this activity should be quickly and widely launched in all factories and mines.

Since May this year, young workers in various places have launched an activity to collect discarded materials under the call for comprehensive savings. The achievements of collecting discarded materials are great. According to incomplete statistics from 17 provinces and cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Liaoning, Shanxi, Henan, and Zhejiang, a total of 90,000 tons of scrap steel, 967 tons of non-ferrous metals, and 560,000 discarded tools have been collected. In the production and savings activities, youth savings teams and youth supervision posts have been organized in various places. According to incomplete statistics from 17 provinces and cities, there are 6,283 youth savings teams with 314,000 participants, and 1,122 youth supervision posts with 5,147 participants. Their regular work is to collect various discarded materials, spread various savings experiences, and help the administration eliminate various waste phenomena. Consolidating and developing the activities of youth savings teams and youth supervision posts, and further enriching their work, is also a good way to promote the production and savings movement.

Industry is the brain of the national economy, while agriculture is the foundation of industrial development. Industry and agriculture must be closely coordinated and developed. During the first five-year plan period, our country will, on the premise of not weakening the investment in industry and transportation, adopt all possible measures to accelerate the development of agriculture. It must be emphasized that the agricultural front is a battlefield where our youth can show their talents for the motherland. Nearly 100 million young people are on this front in our country.

Then, what are the main measures our country will take to accelerate the development of agriculture? On which main issues can our youth show their talents?

The fundamental way to accelerate agricultural development is to accelerate the development of agricultural production cooperatives. Our party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us that the scattered and small-scale peasant economy not only cannot adapt to the development of socialist industrialization but will also spontaneously give rise to capitalism. Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out in his instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperativization: "We must not separate and isolate the two things of industrialization and agricultural transformation in our country, and we must not emphasize one side and weaken the other." Why? Chairman Mao said: "The level of commercial grain and industrial raw materials production in our country is now very low, while the state's demand for these materials is increasing year by year, which is a sharp contradiction. If we cannot basically solve the problem of agricultural cooperativization within approximately three five-year plans, that is, from the use of animal-drawn tools to the use of machinery for large-scale operations, including large-scale state-owned mechanized land reclamation (within three five-year plans, it is planned to reclaim 400 to 500 million mu of land), we will not be able to solve the contradiction between the increasing demand for commercial grain and industrial raw materials and the generally low yield of major crops at present, and our cause of socialist industrialization will encounter great difficulties, and we will not be able to complete socialist industrialization."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The current high tide of social reform in the countryside, which is a great socialist revolution involving more than 500 million rural people, has significance for the whole world." The result of the agricultural cooperativization movement will fundamentally change the face of our rural areas. Broad masses of peasants will gradually change their lives as private small producers, which have been the source of their exploitation and poverty for thousands of years. As they gradually get rid of this life, they will step by step towards a life of permanent common prosperity and happiness.

Our party regards the broad masses of young league members and young activists in rural areas as a reliable shock force for the realization of agricultural cooperativization. Young league members and young activists in rural areas have used facts to prove that they are indeed such a shock force. In the current 650,000 agricultural production cooperatives, there are 17 million young people, of whom 2.9 million are backbone members holding positions such as chairman, vice-chairman, committee member, accountant, team leader, and technician. Most of them are steadfast warriors loyal to collective interests. Sun Xianzhu, Xu Jianchun, Dai Zhanyuan, Ren Huanhai, Liu Bingwen, Bai Yunxiang, Niu Guizhi, Deng Zhaorong, and Yang Xixian, who are sitting in our conference, are outstanding comrades on this front.

Our party has comprehensively planned the great plan for the realization of agricultural cooperativization: to organize half of the country's 55 million peasant households, that is, half of the country's peasant households, into semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives by the end of the last year of the first five-year plan and the beginning of the first year of the second five-year plan; to basically organize the remaining half of the 55 million peasant households during the second five-year plan period; to promote these semi-socialist cooperatives to fully socialist cooperatives and to use machinery on a large scale during the third five-year plan period.

To welcome the new high tide of the socialist mass movement in rural areas across the country, young league members and young activists in rural areas should take the lead in this high tide, mobilize and persuade their families to actively join the cooperatives, and strive to build the cooperatives according to the principle of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and strive for the construction of new socialist rural areas.

After joining the agricultural production cooperatives, peasants will change from scattered individual labor to organized collective labor; peasants will not only consider the interests and harms of individual households but will also constantly consider the collective public interests and harms, which indicates that the life in rural areas is undergoing great changes. Young people are obviously more adaptable to such changes. Facts have shown that many young people can well unite the masses, lead by example, and become the promoters of new socialist winds in rural areas. The management of cooperatives is much more complicated than the household affairs of individual peasants. Doing a good job in management is decisive for the consolidation of cooperatives. Here, the experience and wisdom of the older generation are needed, and the vigor and various new knowledge of young people are also needed. Many young people have become backbone members of cooperatives, which is not accidental. We young people should strive harder and learn more humbly, so that we can play a greater role in the construction and consolidation of cooperatives.

Many rural areas have already put forward the slogan of "being a good member," which has been enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of young members. We should turn this slogan into the slogan of young people in rural areas across the country. How to be a good member? That is to take the lead in diligent work, use various methods to increase production for the cooperative, and to model the love for public property, to resolutely implement the policy of mutual benefit with a spirit of selflessness, and to overcome difficulties with an indomitable spirit, and dare to fight against all behaviors that violate the interests of the cooperative. Who will decide the glorious title of a good member? Of course, it cannot be self-proclaimed, nor can it be designated by a certain cadre or reporter. It should be recognized by the men, women, old, and young of the cooperative. We sincerely hope that all young members will strive to be good members, so that people can see that the young men brought up by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao are indeed the good examples in our cooperatives.

To accelerate the development of agriculture and to promote the agricultural cooperativization movement, young people in rural areas should also use many other methods to strive for increased production.

In improving cultivation techniques, young people can play a great role. Here, we only emphasize a few things that young people can universally and massively do. First, select, cultivate, and promote excellent varieties, and learn and promote advanced agricultural techniques. In the past two years, many young people in rural areas in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Liaoning, Jilin, and Guangxi have launched a movement to artificially pollinate corn, increasing the yield by about 15 jin per mu. The southern rice-producing areas are vigorously promoting the cultivation of double-crop rice, which can increase the yield from 600 to 700 jin per mu to more than 1,000 jin. The agricultural production cooperative led by Huang Haicheng from Fujian Province, who attended this conference, produced an average of 1,360 jin of rice per mu last year. Many cotton-producing areas have already implemented advanced production methods such as deep plowing, rational fertilization, rational planting density, pest control, and pruning, resulting in significant increases in production. These methods should be promoted by young people. Second, strive to increase fertilizer to change the current phenomenon of insufficient fertilization in many cultivated lands. At present, the production of chemical fertilizers in our country is very small, and we should use our own hands to increase fertilizer, first of all, to make full use of manure. In many places in Northeast China and the south, there are no toilets, and a lot of manure is discarded. Young people in these places should take the lead in building toilets, pigpens, and cow sheds to accumulate manure. Another important method to increase fertilizer is to press green manure. In places where there is a lack of grass, grass should be planted first and then cut and pressed for fertilizer. Young people in Henan Province have proposed a "march towards green grass, launch a movement of thousands of carts and tens of thousands of loads of grass cutting and fertilizer accumulation" as a gift to our conference. By the end of August, six regional youth shock brigades and young people have already accumulated 670,000 loads of fertilizer. In Shapan Township, Nanxi County, Sichuan Province, 22 youth shock brigades were organized, and 440,000 jin of fertilizer were accumulated in five days. In addition, methods such as using pond mud, stove soil, house soil, street sweeping, and manure pits can also increase a lot of fertilizer. Third, fight against diseases, pests, and animal pests. In May this year, two counties in Hebei Province, Shanha and Qiu, mobilized more than 30,000 young people to carry out a grass removal and aphid prevention campaign in all cotton fields and along roads, removing 695,000 jin of grass and significantly reducing the occurrence of aphids. The prevention of borers is also an important factor in increasing production in rice-producing areas. The youth shock brigade of the agricultural production cooperative in Gangtou Township, Zhaojing County, Fujian Province, mobilized 149 people to use the method of attracting moths with lamps to kill 42,000 borers. The Miao youth Luo Xuefang's pest control team in Guizhou Province bravely eliminated pests and protected crops. These are our examples of action. Fourth, harvest carefully and return every grain. A lot of grain is lost in the harvesting of crops. If we calculate the average loss of 3 to 5 jin per mu, the 1.5 billion mu of autumn crops nationwide will lose 45 to 75 billion jin of grain, which can feed 900 million to 1.5 billion people for a year. This is a shocking loss. This year, we proposed to launch an activity to reduce grain and cotton losses in rural areas during the autumn harvest, and various places have enthusiastically responded to this call. According to reports from five counties in Hebei Province, including Zhuozhou, the young people in those counties have already collected 450,000 jin of grain from the fields by the beginning of September. According to the report in China Youth Daily on September 20: According to reports from Henan, the county committee of the Communist Youth League in Guangshan County held a meeting of youth shock brigade leaders and grain collection team leaders on August 31, and after the meeting, 220 townships in the entire county held meetings of young activists, and organized 65 grain collection teams, 35 inspection teams, and 55 careful harvesting teams, with 41,600 young people participating. They have already collected 5,006,000 jin of rice from the ground. We must carry out this work extensively and deeply. Young people in agricultural technology promotion stations should strive to learn agricultural science, learn farmers' production experience, and actively promote and popularize advanced agricultural technology. Young people in state farms and ranches should take the lead in learning advanced technology, making production profitable, and fully playing the demonstration role of state-owned enterprises.

Actively and plannedly reclaiming wasteland is a very promising way for our country to increase agricultural production. For thousands of years, our ancestors turned 160 million mu of wasteland into cultivated land, leaving 150 million mu of wasteland still sleeping. Young people should resolutely take the lead in organizing the reclamation of wasteland. The Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team said well: We Chinese youth must not let these wastelands sleep for a long time, let them grow weeds, and must make them grow grain and serve socialism. Our country not only has vast wastelands waiting for us to reclaim in the border areas, but even in densely populated inland areas, there are still many wastelands sleeping. For example, in five regions including Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, there are more than 30 million mu of wasteland with a slope of less than 30 degrees. To reclaim these nearby wastelands, young people in many regions have already taken action under the unified organization of the party. More than 1,200 young people from counties and cities such as Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province have gone to the Jinhua region of their province to reclaim wasteland. Many young people have also reclaimed the vacant land at the edges of villages, on the sides of roads, and in front of and behind houses, and even many young pioneers in many places have planted many sunflowers on small plots of land. For border areas, using the form of reclamation teams to reclaim wasteland can save a lot of state investment compared to settled immigrants and can immediately form a strong high-level form of agricultural production cooperatives. Since the first Beijing Youth Reclamation Team set out, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the provincial and municipal committees of the Communist Youth League have received tens of thousands of letters requesting to participate in the reclamation. These letters are full of boundless love for the motherland and the firm belief in building socialism. One young person in a letter said: "Dear comrades, can I catch up with them? I firmly request to join their ranks and march towards difficulties with them. I was once a sick person, getting sick every three or four days, but after long-term training, I am now better. I dare to guarantee that I will not fall behind them." Now is the time for us to lead these young people full of vigor forward.

Young people should also actively participate in water conservancy projects. Currently, every year, several hundred million mu of land in our country still suffer from water and drought disasters. If we can reduce some of these disasters, it is equivalent to increasing several billion jin of grain every year. The facts of the past few years have proven that our youth are a shock force in water conservancy construction. In the Huai River project, every year, hundreds of thousands of young people are working hard. They, together with other workers, built iron walls and dams, opened mountains, and built reservoirs. Among them, many heroes and models emerged. In the model heroes of the Huai River project in Anhui Province, more than 50% are young people; 609 youth shock brigades and youth teams and groups on the construction sites of the entire province can mostly complete and overfulfill the engineering tasks excellently. In the fight against the great flood in 1954, our youth once again showed their heroic spirit of loyalty to the people and fearlessness of difficulties. Some young people sacrificed their precious lives to defeat the flood, and their deeds will forever inspire our youth to advance. Small-scale agricultural water conservancy is also of great significance for increasing agricultural production. Most of the land in the country can be developed for water conservancy and irrigation, but only 470 million mu are currently being irrigated, and a large number of them are small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects. There are many methods for developing small-scale agricultural water conservancy, such as repairing canals, building ponds, building small reservoirs, and digging wells. Last year, 90 young people in Longtang Township, Gaoping County, Guangdong Province organized a well-digging team and dug 82 wells in five days. We rural youth should all actively participate in the development of small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects.

To increase production, our youth should also make great efforts in forestry construction and launch a widespread tree-planting and afforestation activity. Our motherland covers nearly 10 million square kilometers, but only 200 million square kilometers are cultivated and cultivable land, and the area of forests is only 50 million square kilometers. In the past few years, our country's afforestation industry has developed greatly, and many mountains and deserts have become "barren mountains turned into flowery mountains, and sand beaches turned into grain fields." In the five-year plan, the state will plan to plant a large number of economic forests and shelterbelts, coordinate with large-scale water conservancy projects such as controlling the Yellow River and Huai River, build a large number of water source forests, and promote mass tree-planting, afforestation, and forest protection and fire prevention work. The youth of the entire country should actively participate. Our generation should make a grand vow: to green our great motherland with our own hands. Young people and children can do many things in tree-planting and afforestation: such as collecting and gathering tree seeds, cultivating nurseries, organizing afforestation and forest cultivation, and forest protection and fire prevention teams. There are 186 million young people and children in our country. If each person plants and grows one tree per year, with an average of 120 trees per mu, 15.5 million mu of land can be afforested per year. In the past few years, many places have achieved great results in the tree-planting and afforestation and forest protection activities of young people and children, and we will carry out this activity more extensively and deeply in the future.

Young people should also pay attention to the development of animal husbandry. The development of animal husbandry can increase draft power, increase fertilizer, increase leather and fur, increase meat, and increase income. Young people in agricultural and pastoral areas should all pay attention to the development of animal husbandry, learn animal husbandry and breeding technology, learn feeding and management, and increase the number of livestock and improve the quality of livestock. The Mongolian youth Huada and the Kyrgyz youth Tuerxunniya from Xinjiang, who are present, are outstanding labor models in animal husbandry work. The female pig farmer Hua Yinfeng from Dongyang Farm in Zhejiang Province does not mind dirt or hard work, loves her job, creates methods such as timed and quantitative feeding, group management, reasonable rationing, and attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and improves the production rate of pigs. This is worth learning from. Everything beneficial to the people, every young person should actively and enthusiastically do it without asking for payment.

In addition, doing a good job in state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, expanding commodity circulation, accelerating capital turnover, and reducing circulation costs are of great significance for the development of socialist industrial construction and the agricultural cooperativization movement. Young workers active on the commercial front have many good experiences, and they should continue to work hard. Young people in handicrafts should actively strive for the cooperativization of handicrafts.

Young workers in private industrial and commercial enterprises are also glorious fighters for socialism. They should also strive for production and savings and contribute to the state's construction cause. They should also, together with the broad masses of workers, seriously supervise the socialist transformation of capitalist and commercial industries. Without the socialist transformation of capitalist and commercial industries, socialist industrialization cannot be completed, and it will also hinder the progress of the agricultural cooperativization movement. Our party teaches us that due to the trend of the times and the great future of the motherland, those patriotic elements in the bourgeoisie who can see the future will be willing to accept socialist transformation, and we must adopt a welcoming attitude towards them. However, the socialist transformation of capitalist and commercial industries will not be smooth sailing, but a complex and sharp class struggle. Some stubborn elements in the bourgeoisie use methods such as embezzling funds, shoddy work, tax evasion, inciting discord, spreading rumors, causing trouble, and destroying the unity of the working class to resist socialist transformation. Corrupting and seducing young people from their lives is also one of their vicious means. Every young person working in private industrial and commercial enterprises should stand firmly on the side of the working class and, according to the state's policies and laws, resolutely fight against the vicious behavior of this part of the bourgeoisie.

If it is thought that the major tasks in industry and agriculture are only related to comrades working on the production front and in economic departments, it is certainly wrong. Comrades engaged in political work, scientific work, and cultural and educational work, by doing a good job in their own work, also play an active role in socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Savings must also be a national movement. Our party points out to us that implementing a strict savings system nationwide is a constant task of the people of our country in the process of building a socialist and communist society. We young people should actively participate in the savings movement in all aspects.

Comrades, we must see that the construction of socialist industry and the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement are a great revolutionary movement. We must greatly develop the social productive forces of our country. We must also reform the production relations and social economic system based on private ownership. Without such reform of production relations and social economic system, the development of social productive forces is impossible. The cause we are undertaking today is a social revolution led by the working class to eliminate all exploiting classes, and the struggle we are undertaking today is the most sharp, intense, and complex struggle in the history of our country. To build our country into a great socialist country, we must defeat all domestic and foreign enemies, and we must also overcome all habits, prejudices, customs, and thoughts that are incompatible with socialism and arise from the private ownership system. When we strive to participate in the construction of socialist industry and the agricultural cooperativization movement, we are doing the unprecedented earth-shaking work that our predecessors have never done. Our generation of youth can, under the leadership of our party and Chairman Mao, together with the people of the entire country, strive to complete this great cause, which is an endless honor. We must strive.

Study Culture, Master Technology, and March Towards Science

The people of our country have already become the masters of the state and are engaged in the great cause of socialist construction. To be able to manage all the affairs of the state and to do a good job in socialist construction, the people of our country must become cultured people. With culture, one can acquire various new knowledge and master advanced science and technology. Our party teaches us that without advanced science and technology, it is impossible to build socialism. In the old society, the exploiting class sought to monopolize culture and science, making the broad masses of laboring people fall into ignorance and backwardness. Now we should make culture and science belong to workers, peasants, and all laborers.

Marching towards culture and science is a very important historical task that falls on our generation of youth. This is a very serious task. Old China created a situation where the cultural level of the broad masses of people was very low and science and technology were backward. Many young people in the past did not even have the opportunity to learn the most basic culture. We must advance step by step under these difficult conditions. We must be as tenacious as fighting against the enemy to conquer the fortresses of culture and science one by one.

First of all, the broad masses of young people in our country should strive to learn ordinary culture. Without ordinary culture, it is impossible to talk about seizing any fortresses of science. Military fortresses have a layer of thorns around them, and scientific fortresses also have a layer of thorns around them, which is ordinary culture. Soldiers attacking military fortresses always first clear away the obstacle of thorns, and now we are attacking scientific fortresses, and we should also be like soldiers, first clearing away the obstacle of ordinary culture.

Illiterate and culturally backward young people understand the importance of learning culture. They say: "No matter how much you say, without culture, it's hard to get by"; "Calculating work tickets with your hands, drawing accounts with lines, it's hard to bear without culture"; "Cooperatives are really good, but without culture, they can't be managed well." The youth of New China must make up their minds to at least learn to write, calculate, and read newspapers, and on this basis, continuously improve their cultural level, so that we become active fighters in socialist construction.

Title: On the Education of the Youth and the Construction of Socialism

The best way to acquire general cultural knowledge is, of course, to go to school from a young age. However, it is not correct to think that cultural knowledge can only be acquired in regular primary and secondary schools. Currently, our country has 58.41 million students in primary and junior high schools, which is more than double the highest number during the Kuomintang era. During the first Five-Year Plan, the number of students in junior high schools will increase to 3,983,300, and the number of primary school students will increase to 60,230,000. However, due to the need for our country to invest a large amount of funds in industrial development, and due to the shortage of teachers, it will take considerable time to train enough teachers. Moreover, our country's industrial and agricultural production teams currently need a large number of people with basic cultural knowledge to participate. Therefore, for a certain period, it will not be possible for every young person in the country to attend primary school, let alone complete junior high school. Many young people who have studied for a period in school will not be able to continue their education, and many young people who have passed the age of entering primary school still lack basic cultural knowledge. They should make use of various conditions to engage in productive labor while acquiring cultural knowledge and continuously improving their cultural level. Our country has also created many favorable conditions for them, such as establishing a large number of part-time schools for workers and peasants, and organizing self-study groups for graduates of primary and junior high schools, as well as setting up cultural remedial schools in cities. In 1954, approximately 19 million young people participated in part-time schools for workers and peasants, and more than 500,000 graduates of primary and junior high schools and young people in society participated in self-study groups and cultural remedial schools.

Someone asked, can cultural knowledge be acquired and continuously improved while engaging in productive labor? The broad masses of young people have already answered this question with facts. There are countless examples of this. Here is a typical example. In Shatou Village, Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, there are 206 young men and women. After several years of effort, 191 of them have reached the level of primary school or above, and the remaining 15 young people are currently studying in a permanent civic school, with only one person not participating in the study due to having too many children. Such villages, where young people have been effectively eliminated of illiteracy, can be found in several provinces such as Jilin, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Hunan. Everyone knows that some comrades did not receive much education in their childhood, but after entering factories or the army, they have learned to read and write through diligent study, and some have even written literary works. Comrades such as Gao Yuba and Cui Baowa in the army, and Shen Hugen, Li Xueao, and Zhao Zhipeng in factories are like this. Comrade Zhao Zhipeng, who is present, originally only studied for five years, but now has become a young scientific worker. Comrade Xu Renwu, after seven years of self-study, has raised his level from primary school to the equivalent of a university graduate.

We should seriously launch a campaign to eliminate illiteracy among the broad masses of young people in the countryside. Young people who are illiterate must consciously learn culture well, make a decision, and set a plan to no longer be "blind with open eyes" within three to five years. Young League members who are illiterate must take the lead actively. Young people who have some cultural knowledge should not only continue to strive to improve their culture but also actively and enthusiastically help illiterate or culturally backward companions to study. It should be known that sharing what one has learned with one's comrades is a manifestation of revolutionary friendship. Young people participating in part-time schools and self-study groups should deeply understand the purpose of learning, and modelly observe learning discipline, so that these learning organizations can quickly consolidate and develop. All primary-level organizations of the League should take on the responsibility of caring for young people's learning of culture and helping them improve their culture. They should actively assist the government in running part-time schools and self-study groups, patiently mobilize and organize the broad masses of young people to voluntarily strive to learn culture, and make the Young League truly a main force in eliminating illiteracy and spreading culture.

In the countryside, young people with culture have a very important responsibility. The vast countryside of old China was in a state of extreme poverty and cultural backwardness. At that time, many people had the idea that a young person who could read and write was not worth staying in a remote and backward village, and was not worth working hard in the wind and rain. This outdated view should now be rejected by all young people in New China and all those who care about the future of young people. It must be known that our countryside is now a new countryside, and it will become a completely new countryside with the development of the cooperative movement, that is, a cultured and prosperous socialist countryside. To achieve this goal, we need many young people with culture to work in the countryside. In the countryside, graduates of primary and junior high schools and other young people with a certain level of culture can not only use their cultural knowledge to serve agricultural production and the construction of cooperatives but also become the basic force for cultural construction in the countryside. Many villages rely on this force, under the leadership of the Party and the government, to establish village clubs, village drama troupes, village libraries, blackboard newspapers, reading groups, radio stations, and other mass cultural and artistic activities suitable for local needs. Making culture popular in the countryside is an important aspect of building a new countryside and an important aspect of raising the cultural level of our country. Young intellectuals in the countryside should play a great role in this.

For all young people studying in schools, we hope they will study hard, strive to master various specialized knowledge and sciences, and be prepared to serve the socialist cause of the motherland well after leaving school. Everyone knows that our country spends a large amount of funds every year to run schools, which accounts for about 7 to 8 percent of the total national financial expenditure. Our country's schools at all levels are developing continuously. In addition to primary and junior high schools, the number of students in senior high schools, secondary specialized schools, and institutions of higher learning in our country has now reached more than 1.4 million. In recent years, students across the country have had the opportunity to develop comprehensively under the loving care of the Party and the state. They have clearly seen the bright future of the motherland and deeply felt the happiness of living in the era of Mao Zedong, and thus have an even greater yearning and love for socialism. They enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call for the "Three Good" and have made great progress in various aspects such as academic performance, health, political awareness, and moral character. This is a very gratifying phenomenon.

Our Party expects every student to become a new type of intellectual. This new type of intellectual not only needs to have modern scientific knowledge and a strong physique but also, most fundamentally and importantly, needs to have a high level of political awareness, that is, socialist awareness. The intellectuals needed by the state are not those who, after acquiring some specialized knowledge, look down on the working people and cannot share the joys and sorrows with the masses. Instead, they are intellectuals who love the working people, maintain close contact with the masses in their work, can stand firmly on the side of the working class in the sharp and complex class struggle, and are loyal to the socialist cause to the end.

Now, in our country's institutions of higher learning, secondary specialized schools, and senior high schools, the proportion of students from worker and peasant backgrounds is increasing. This is a good phenomenon. Continuously increasing the number of intellectuals with higher specialized knowledge from worker and peasant backgrounds is of great significance to the development of our country's construction. We hope these comrades will recognize this and strive even harder. There is also a part of students from exploitative classes or reactionary families. We also hope they can become conscious builders of socialism. We have never equated young intellectuals from exploitative classes or reactionary families with their families. The Party and the state have no exceptions in their expectations for young intellectuals. However, this part of comrades must recognize that due to their family background, they are more likely to be influenced by the ideas of the exploiting classes, even reactionary ideas. Therefore, they should strive to temper themselves politically, sincerely accept the Party's education, and resolutely draw a clear line with reactionary ideas and all ideas of the exploiting classes.

For all young people who have expertise in work and technology, we hope they will strive to cultivate themselves into experts in various fields. Currently, on our country's economic front, there are tens of thousands of young technical personnel and a large number of young technical workers, on the educational front, there are more than a million young teachers, and in economic, political, and cultural institutions, there are more than two million young cadres. These comrades, due to the cultivation of the Party and the state and their own efforts, have made rapid progress. Although they generally lack knowledge and experience and cannot yet be called experts, as long as they strive, they have the conditions to become true experts in various positions and many of them can become vanguard fighters in the march towards science. They should strive to do a good job in their positions, study and master professional scientific knowledge, and continuously improve their knowledge and abilities.

Everyone knows that now humanity has entered the atomic age, and the development of world science is truly changing day by day. We want to build socialism, so we must master the most advanced, most complex, and highest-level scientific and technological knowledge of the present. Our country not only needs tens of millions of experts in various fields who are proficient in general advanced science and technology but also needs tens of thousands of experts who are proficient in advanced science and technology; not only needs a few kinds of experts and specialists but also needs thousands of kinds of experts and specialists. Many of our comrades have grand aspirations to cultivate themselves into experts in their own fields, which is very good, and this is exactly what our Party and state eagerly expect.

So, what path should we take to achieve this goal? There are two paths. One is the path indicated by our Party and Chairman Mao, which is to actively and humbly learn from all experts, treat them as teachers, and learn from them sincerely and honestly. Do not pretend to know when you do not know, do not put on airs, and do not be arrogant and self-satisfied. Dive in, for a few months, a year or two, three or five years, study diligently and hard. This is the only correct path, a path with great prospects, and we should all take this path.

However, there is another path. This is either to exaggerate the little knowledge one has acquired, thinking that one no longer needs to learn from the older generation, let alone from ordinary people; or to be satisfied with the little achievement one has made, thinking that one can get by with this and no longer needs to advance; or to think that when one is assigned a specific job, it is a "waste of talent" and a "waste of one's youth." This is certainly a path that will lead to complete failure, a very dangerous path. Our Party hopes that none of us will take this path. Let us all say: We will not take such a path.

At our meeting, there are many outstanding young cadres and specialists from various fronts such as industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, finance, politics, military, science, education, health, literature, art, and sports. We believe that they and all young comrades on these fronts will not disappoint the Party's ardent expectations. We hope they will make more contributions to the motherland in the future and create greater glory for the motherland.

We should also point out that there are many branches of science that our young people should learn, and generally speaking, each person can only be proficient in one branch. However, there is one science that everyone should learn, and that is Marxism-Leninism. We should remember Stalin's teaching: "There is one branch of science that all Bolsheviks in all fields must possess, and that is the Marxist-Leninist science of society, the laws of social development, the laws of the development of the proletarian revolution, the laws of the development of the socialist cause, and the science of the victory of communism."

Marxism-Leninism can help us expand our horizons, distinguish right from wrong, foresee the future, and strengthen our beliefs. To make ourselves conscious builders of socialism, we must strive to learn Marxism-Leninism and arm ourselves with the Marxist-Leninist science of the laws of social development. Some comrades urgently want to become experts in a certain science and regard the study of Marxism-Leninism as seemingly an unnecessary burden, which is wrong. Some comrades think that because of their low level of culture, they cannot study Marxism-Leninism, which is also wrong. Of course, to be proficient in Marxism-Leninism, one cannot do without a certain level of culture, but understanding the basic views of Marxism-Leninism is completely feasible for many young people from worker and peasant backgrounds. The Young League organization should be good at using various forms to conduct Marxism-Leninism education. The policies, laws, and documents of our Party and state are the concretization of Marxism-Leninism, so we should vigorously organize young people to read newspapers and learn the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism through the explanations of various policies and laws in the newspapers. For all young people with a certain level of culture, it is necessary to systematically study Marxist-Leninist theory. Our Party has led a critique of bourgeois idealism in the past year, greatly enhancing the importance of studying Marxist-Leninist theory among the broad masses of young people. Some young comrades have actively participated in this ideological struggle. Our Party expects a large number of theoretical cadres to emerge from the ranks of young intellectuals to strengthen the Party's theoretical front. We believe that many young intellectuals will strive towards the goals that our Party expects.

Raise Revolutionary Vigilance and Defend the Socialist Construction of the Motherland

Our Party teaches us that our country's socialist construction has extremely favorable conditions. The great Soviet Union is our most reliable and loyal friend, and the Soviet Union has given our industrialization tremendous, comprehensive, and selfless help with its great friendship. The Chinese people regard the Soviet people as their best teachers, and Chinese youth regard Soviet youth as their best examples. The various people's democratic countries are also our loyal and reliable friends, and they have given us brotherly support. There are also many friendly countries that treat us with sympathy and goodwill and coexist peacefully with us. The people of the world all look forward to our victory with joy and expectation. The Chinese people and Chinese youth attach great importance to the friendship of the people and youth of the world. Why will our country's socialist construction definitely be victorious? This is not only because we have the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the power of 600 million people but also because our cause is a just cause that is closely related to the interests of the vast majority of people on Earth. We and the people of the world, the people of the world and we, are closely united. Such a cause is certainly invincible.

However, our Party warns us not to be complacent and disarm ourselves with the idea of being "invincible." Because first, there are still extremely hostile imperialist aggressor groups in the world; second, there is still the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan; third, there are still determined counter-revolutionaries among the classes that have been overthrown and will be eliminated on the mainland. The imperialists, the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek group, and the hidden counter-revolutionaries are colluding with each other to use all means to sabotage every piece of our socialist work. They are always plotting how to restore the evil rule they once had over our people. For our happy and beautiful future, we must never relax our vigilance against the enemy and never relax our struggle against the enemy.

The imperialist elements of the United States shamelessly say that the Chinese people want to invade other countries and nations, which is a lie of the dying social forces. Everyone knows that any dying social force that is about to perish can only maintain its existence by deceiving the people. The social system of the People's Republic of China determines that we will absolutely not and do not need to live by invading others. The Chinese people do not want to fight with any country and are willing to be friendly with all nations in the world, including the United States. Chinese youth are willing to be closely united with the youth of all countries in the world, including American youth.

Here, we must point out that if someone thinks that the Chinese people's consistent advocacy of peaceful coexistence among all countries is due to our weakness and helplessness, then they are completely wrong. Whoever tries to mess with the Chinese people will have to be prepared to receive a lesson from reality. The Chinese people have experience and strength in defending their country. Invaders should be careful not to have their heads smashed to pieces on the Chinese people's iron wall.

Our government is working with the Soviet government and the governments of various people's democratic countries to effectively ease international tensions. The international forces of aggression are trying to use the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who are plotting to divide our territory to threaten our country and create tension in the Far East, which we absolutely cannot allow. The Chinese people will definitely liberate their territory of Taiwan. We will never forget our compatriots in Taiwan for a single minute. As long as Taiwan has not returned to the embrace of the great motherland, our struggle will never stop.

To safeguard the security and integrity of the territory and sovereignty of our great motherland, our country must strengthen national defense and build national defense forces. The new youth of China have a particularly important responsibility in this regard.

Our country has promulgated the Military Service Law and begun to implement the compulsory military service system. The broad masses of young people across the country have expressed their heartfelt support. Supporting the Military Service Law and fulfilling military service obligations according to the law is the concrete realization of our young people's lofty aspirations to defend the motherland, defend world peace, and oppose imperialist aggression. We must assure our dear motherland: We are always ready to accept your call. In addition to serving in the military, we should also pay constant attention to physical training and learn military knowledge so that we can work for the motherland for a longer time and defend the motherland more tenaciously. For this, the Youth League organization should advocate that young people pay attention to hygiene and widely carry out physical education activities. It should organize young people to participate in systematic "Labor and Defense" training in an orderly manner and carry out national defense physical education activities. Carrying out physical education activities is a work of great significance to the motherland that the Party and Chairman Mao want the Youth League to vigorously organize.

Our young people should also support our national defense forces and national defense construction in various ways. Working hard and doing a good job in all the work of the state are all forms of support for national defense forces. In addition, our young people should support the People's Liberation Army through various means. We should continue to carry forward the fine tradition of military-civilian cooperation cultivated during the long period of revolutionary war. We should continue to carry forward the fine tradition of caring for and helping the families of soldiers and martyrs. We should give enthusiastic help to demobilized soldiers in their work, study, and life.

The young people in the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteer Army should be a hundred times more vigilant, modelly complete the tasks assigned by their superiors, and strive to learn modern military technology. They should strictly observe various orders and disciplines. The young people in our army have always been models for the entire youth of the nation. The broad masses of young people have learned lofty patriotism and revolutionary heroism from the countless heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteer Army. There are more than 150 heroes from the army sitting in our meeting, and we should especially welcome them.

Our Party teaches us that our country today not only has open enemies but also has hidden counter-revolutionaries. Hidden counter-revolutionaries are our most dangerous enemies. Hidden counter-revolutionaries are particularly dangerous because they are enemies hidden among us, hidden in our hearts. The Party calls on us to decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely eliminate them. The struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries is a sacred struggle to defend the socialist construction of the motherland. All young people who love the motherland must join this great struggle. Yes, our young people have already bravely joined this struggle. There are dozens of such outstanding comrades sitting in our meeting.

The struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries has a special and profound significance for our young people. Because counter-revolutionaries always exploit the weaknesses of young people and use all kinds of deception to lure young people into traps. Some young people sometimes have the weakness of pursuing life's pleasures, and counter-revolutionaries use various despicable means to lure them onto the wrong path and corrupt them with immoral behavior. Some young people think highly of themselves and unrealistically try to become famous overnight, and counter-revolutionaries flatter them, making them feel "unappreciated," and even turn them against revolutionary organizations. Some young people, for some personal considerations, hide something from their history in the organization, and counter-revolutionaries seize this opportunity to force them to do things harmful to the state and the people. Young people generally have little experience and are politically naive, so counter-revolutionaries look for every opportunity to attack them. From this, it can be seen that the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries is also a struggle for us young people to defend our political lives and grow into strong fighters for the socialist cause of the motherland.

The evil plots of counter-revolutionaries are doomed to fail. The young people of New China are organized and have socialist consciousness under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, and our young people's organizational discipline and political consciousness are constantly improving. This is the fundamental reason why counter-revolutionaries cannot do as they please and we can eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries. We must continue to improve organizational discipline and political consciousness among the broad masses of young people to defeat all counter-revolutionaries.

The broad masses of young people have deeply felt the importance of organization from actual life. If we are scattered and disorganized, even if there are thousands and tens of thousands of people, the enemy can easily defeat us one by one. But when we are organized tightly, we have boundless power. Organization gives each of us courage and strength, and each of us has the responsibility to consolidate and strengthen the organization. Discipline is an important weapon for strengthening the organization. In work and struggle, we must strictly observe the discipline of the state, the discipline of social life, and the discipline of revolutionary organizations. This is our duty to the collective.

Various counter-revolutionaries are doing their utmost to slander our organization, saying that our organization and discipline hinder the development of individuals, and even saying that only mediocre people will strictly observe discipline. The young people of New China know that such nonsense only proves that our organization and discipline are what our enemies fear and hate the most. Our organization and discipline are based on the public interests of the people. The more we respect the organization and observe discipline, the more we can fully develop our individual abilities according to the interests of the people. We know that only by strictly observing discipline can we live closely in the great collective, and thus feel that we are truly strong. On the contrary, if we stand in opposition to discipline, we will only feel that we are weak and insignificant. Our collective life not only does not restrict individuals but also guarantees the true personal freedom of not being oppressed and exploited, and guarantees the all-round development of individual abilities. We must fight against any thoughts and actions that undermine our organization and discipline, and consciously strengthen our organizational discipline. Only in this way can we achieve victory in the great cause of building socialism and crush all enemies.

Comrades, now let us talk about the issue of raising socialist consciousness. Each of us must strive to raise our socialist consciousness. This is not only for the struggle against counter-revolutionaries but also the foundation of all our activities. What is a socialist construction activist? Fundamentally speaking, these are people who have a high level of socialist consciousness. Socialist consciousness can be said to be our "soul." A worker without a "soul" cannot be a good worker. Only those who constantly raise their socialist consciousness can continuously create new achievements on the production front, march towards culture and science with unyielding will, fight selflessly to defend the motherland, and consciously observe discipline, always maintaining revolutionary vigilance.

We have full confidence in the great socialist cause. We firmly believe that the cause we are engaged in is a lofty and just cause, and that this cause will definitely be victorious. Counter-revolutionaries are trying their best to make us spiritually scattered. They use any little wind or grass movement to frighten us, trying to prove that we will encounter insurmountable difficulties and that our cause will ultimately fail. But counter-revolutionaries cannot shake the resolve of those who have firm beliefs. Why do we have such firm beliefs? This is because our beliefs are based on a scientific understanding of the laws of social history. The development of social history has its objective laws, which are not changed by the will of people. According to the objective laws of history, according to the laws of the development of class struggle, communism will not only definitely be realized in China but will definitely be realized throughout the world. We learn to use the method of class analysis to look at all things, understand the objective laws of historical development, and can scientifically recognize the inevitability of the complete victory of socialism and communism in China, and see that realizing this inevitability is most in line with the interests of the broad masses of the Chinese people, and that all difficulties in the process of advancement are surmountable and must be surmounted. Therefore, our beliefs will never be shaken. Raising our socialist consciousness is to constantly strengthen this belief based on scientific understanding.

Raising socialist consciousness is also to require ourselves to adhere to the moral standards of communism. Since we have complete confidence in the socialist cause, we must spare no effort to struggle for this cause. We are consistent in words and deeds, and consistent in theory and practice. For us, what is good behavior and what is bad behavior? Permanently eliminating the phenomenon of man exploiting man and building a society based on the mutual assistance and cooperation of the working people is good behavior; on the contrary, selfishness and self-interest, only caring for one's own interests and harming the interests of others and the public, and living by exploiting others is a despicable behavior that should be spat upon. We love our motherland, love the common cause of the people, and are willing to contribute all our strength for the interests of the motherland and the common cause of the people. We treat all ethnic groups within the country equally and unite like brothers and sisters. Our patriotism and internationalism are closely combined, we care about and support the progressive cause of the people of all countries, and love the people and youth of all other countries. We work honestly, diligently serve the people, and always care about the public interests, consciously protect public property; we maintain close contact with the masses, resolutely defend the interests of the people, and wage uncompromising struggles against all things that go against the interests of the people. These are the concrete manifestations of our communist moral behavior. These are also the new moral qualities that are being increasingly promoted among the broad masses of young activists. Chairman Mao once pointed out that the spirit of a true communist is the spirit of "selflessness"; Chairman Mao taught us: "A person may have great or small abilities, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended low tastes, and a person who is beneficial to the people." Raising socialist consciousness is also to make us become people with such a communist spirit.

From this, it can be seen that to raise our socialist consciousness, we should learn the scientific knowledge of the laws of social development in Marxism-Leninism in combination with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution, and strive to temper ourselves in practical struggles. In the transitional period full of complex class struggles, bourgeois ideology is still infiltrating and influencing the broad masses of young people in various ways, and various counter-revolutionaries are doing their utmost to poison our young people with bourgeois individualist ideology, bourgeois idealist ideology, and the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie. Young people must strive to resist and repel all these infiltrations. The danger of bourgeois ideology lies in the fact that it is directly opposed to the requirements of raising socialist consciousness. If one is influenced by bourgeois individualism, one will despise the working people, alienate oneself from the masses, and regard pure selfishness as a matter of course. If one is influenced by bourgeois idealism, one will not be able to see clearly the laws of social development, and will not be able to judge right and wrong according to objective laws and the interests of the broad masses, and will lose confidence in the socialist cause. If one is influenced by the deceitful, lazy, and extravagant lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, then it goes without saying, one will only go down the path of corruption and decadence, and corruption and decadence often lead to the beginning of counter-revolution. To raise socialist consciousness among the broad masses of young people, we must continue to deeply wage a struggle against bourgeois ideology and the decadent moral concepts of the bourgeoisie.

People with high political consciousness are not afraid of difficulties. Building socialism is indeed a great cause, and there must be many difficulties. Revolution is always victorious by overcoming difficulties. Struggling hard is the glorious tradition of our revolutionary ranks. We must inherit and carry forward this tradition. The difficulties that revolutionary predecessors experienced were snow-capped mountains, grasslands, bloodshed, and sacrifice. Compared to the difficulties of our revolutionary elders, what are our current difficulties? Difficulties can only intimidate those who cannot endure hardship, difficulties fear hardworking and persevering warriors. Difficulties can only intimidate cowards, difficulties fear tenacious attackers. Difficulties can only intimidate lazybones, difficulties fear those who study hard. Difficulties can only intimidate those who are alienated from the masses, difficulties fear a great united collective. The youth of New China should not bow their heads or retreat in the face of difficulties, but should fight against difficulties and overcome them. We should consciously take on the most arduous tasks and temper ourselves into strong socialist and communist warriors.

The Special Responsibilities of the Youth League Organization and Its Members

Everyone knows that the Youth League is not just any ordinary organization; the Youth League is the advanced organization of Chinese youth and an active assistant of the Communist Party of China. Since the Youth League is such an organization, it is not just anyone who can be a member of the Youth League. To be a member of the Youth League, one must be a loyal executor of the Party's policies, a resolute and active fighter for socialism, and a friend and model of the youth masses. On September 18, the Central Committee of the Youth League held its third plenary meeting and unanimously adopted a proposal to change the name of the New Democratic Youth League of China to the Communist Youth League of China. It is not difficult to understand that changing the name of the New Democratic Youth League to the Communist Youth League is not just a simple change of name, like changing one's name from Zhang San to Li Si. Changing the name of the New Democratic Youth League to the Communist Youth League signifies that the Youth League organization will be even more resolute and active in fighting for socialism and communism to the end, and it means that every member must strive even harder to cultivate themselves into communists. It can be predicted that all comrades in the League and young people across the country will welcome this historic event with a fighting attitude.

Currently, the Youth League has 30 provincial and municipal committees, 345 prefectural and municipal committees, 2,071 county committees and equivalent county committees, more than 620,000 grassroots organizations, and more than 1.4 million members. In the past two years, the vast majority of our League organizations have actively assisted the Party in mobilizing the entire League and leading the broad masses of young people to actively struggle for socialism. Our 1.4 million League members are mostly at the forefront of the youth masses, bravely struggling for socialism. The composition of our meeting clearly shows this. Of the 1,527 comrades attending this meeting, 1,408 are League members, and of these, 923 comrades have already honorably joined the Communist Party of China.

However, it must be pointed out that there are still some counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements mixed in our League organizations. Although they are a small number, if we allow them to exist, they will cause great danger. We absolutely cannot allow counter-revolutionaries to hide under the banner of the Youth League to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. We must thoroughly investigate and eliminate them. Other bad elements are also enemies of the Youth League organization. They use the name of the Youth League to violate laws and regulations, distort the Party's policies, and destroy the blood and flesh connection between the League and the youth masses. We must also resolutely expel them. As for those in our League who do not meet the standards of a League member and have backward ideological consciousness, we must strengthen their education. We believe that most of these comrades can be educated well, and if there are a few who cannot be educated, we will have to ask them to leave the League.

Comrades can see that during the period leading up to the third National Congress of the Youth League, which is scheduled to be held in the second half of next year, we will vigorously strengthen the construction of the League organization. We believe that all young people who love socialism will help us expose all counter-revolutionaries and bad elements who have infiltrated the League, help us educate those backward League members who do not meet the standards, and help us absorb a large number of active young people who are struggling for socialism into the ranks of the League. They will become the new blood of the Youth League organization.

A Few Hopes for Activists

For the great and arduous cause of socialism, we need tens of millions of activists. Our Party and Chairman Mao hope that our country will have tens of thousands of activists, labor heroes, and model workers. It is very appropriate to re-raise Chairman Mao's words at the 1945 Conference of Labor Heroes and Model Workers in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region at this meeting. In that speech, Chairman Mao gave a very high evaluation of labor heroes and model workers. He said:

"You have held a meeting, summarized your experiences, and everyone welcomes and respects you. You have three merits and play three roles. First, the role of taking the lead. This is because you have worked particularly hard, made many innovations, and your work has become a model for others, raising the work standards and inspiring everyone to learn from you. Second, the role of being the backbone. Most of you are not yet cadres, but you are already the backbone and core of the masses. With you, work can be promoted more easily. In the future, you may become cadres, and you are now the reserve force of cadres. Third, the role of being a bridge. You are the bridge between the leaders above and the broad masses below. The opinions of the masses are conveyed to you and then to the leaders above, and the opinions of the leaders above are conveyed to you and then to the masses below."

Chairman Mao went on to say:

"You have many merits and have made great contributions, but you must remember not to be arrogant. You are respected by everyone, which is deserved, but it is also easy to become arrogant. If you become arrogant, do not learn humbly, do not work hard, do not respect others, do not respect cadres, and do not respect the masses, you will no longer be heroes and models. There have been such people in the past, and we hope you will not follow their example."

Please pay attention, this is how Chairman Mao talks to activists. Unfortunately, we indeed have such young people who, after becoming activists, forget themselves, become arrogant and self-satisfied, and no longer work hard. The result? The result is that they fall.

We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and continue to move forward honestly, diligently, and vigorously.

Dear comrades! We must always move forward. We must always be loyal sons and daughters of our great motherland!

Long live our great motherland!

Long live the great Communist Party of China, which leads the people of China to prosperity, strength, and an infinitely beautiful socialist and communist society!

Long live our most beloved leader and teacher, Chairman Mao!

    中国青年为实现第一个五年计划而斗争的任务
    ——中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会向全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的报告
    胡耀邦亲爱的同志们！
    这次大会是我国各民族男女青年向社会主义进军的一次大会师。中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会委托我向大会作报告，并代表青年团中央向来自祖国各个战线上的一千五百二十七名优秀的青年积极分子致热烈的祝贺。
    召开这次大会的目的是什么呢？中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会第二届第二次全体会议的决议明确地说过，这就是：为着进一步发挥全国青年在社会主义建设中的积极性和创造性，表彰各个战线上的青年积极分子对于祖国的贡献，并且把他们的先进经验和优良品质向全国青年宣传和推广，更好地动员全国青年为解放台湾，为完成和争取超额完成国民经济第一个五年计划的各项任务而斗争。因此，这次大会要用主要的时间听取你们的发言。青年团中央相信你们一定会把自己对祖国的贡献和经验，把自己今后努力的计划，忠实地向祖国汇报，向全国青年汇报。这次大会还要商讨这样一个极其重大的问题，这就是：我国青年应该如何同全国人民一道，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导下，为完成和争取超额完成祖国的第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    大家都知道，在今年七月举行的第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，通过了由中国共产党中央委员会提出的“中华人民共和国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”。我们的党教导我们说，我国的第一个五年计划，就是要给我国伟大的社会主义建设事业打下初步的但是坚固的基础。五年计划代表着我国人民整体的长远的利益。从五年计划中，我们看到了祖国的无限繁荣幸福的前途，在我们青年面前展开了多方面发挥我们的才能和智慧的宽广的天地。用一切力量完成和争取超额完成这个计划，乃是我国人民、我国青年的最神圣的任务。
    我们的党把年轻的一代看作是实现五年计划、建设社会主义的一支巨大的突击力量。为什么它是一支巨大的突击力量呢？因为我国青年有一亿二千万人之多，占全国总人口五分之一，占全国劳动力的三分之一以上；因为青年不但身体健壮、精力饱满，而且是在中国共产党教养下成长起来的，能够敏锐地感受新鲜事物，怀着热烈的愿望和最大的勇气，追求祖国的社会主义的美好前程。
    我们相信，新中国的青年是不会辜负党对我们的期望的。我们全国青年会这样说：为了伟大的祖国，我们决不吝惜自己的力量！但是光有诺言是办不好任何事情的，如果诺言不用坚决的行动去兑现，这种诺言是一钱不值的。
    那么我们应该怎样行动呢？在这个大会之前召开的中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会第二届第三次全体会议认为：根据国家第一个五年计划的具体要求，根据青年的特殊情况，根据目前我国的国内外的实际环境，全国青年应当为下面这几件大事而普遍地积极地动员起来，这些大事就是：一、积极参加社会主义工业建设和农业合作化运动；二、学习文化，掌握技术，向科学进军；三、提高革命警惕性，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
    积极参加社会主义工业建设和农业合作化运动
    第一个五年计划的经济建设任务是十分艰巨的。祖国的富强，必须依靠在经济建设战线上取得决定意义的胜利。大家知道，第一个五年计划要为我国的社会主义工业化打下初步的基础。五年内要完成和着手新建和扩建二千九百九十四个工业单位，工业总产值要比一九五二年提高将近一倍；要增加铁路总长约一万公里，公路一万多公里。第一个五年计划要为实现农业社会主义改造打下初步基础。到一九五七年，农业和农副业的总产值要比一九五二年提高将近四分之一。五年内，除建设十三个大型水库外，修浚河道的土石方工程共十三亿立方公尺；要营造林地九千万亩；根治黄河的伟大工程也要着手进行。五年内，要努力把手工业组织起来，建立对手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础。五年内，要基本上把资本主义工商业分别纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。做到上面这些，我国的工农业总产值将达到一千二百四十九亿九千万元，比一九五二年增长百分之五十一以上。为了实现这个宏大的计划，国家要投资七百六十六亿四千万元，折合黄金七万万多两。这是一笔巨大的资金。为了积累这笔巨大的资金，为了完成和争取超额完成五年计划，党号召我们开展一个全面的持久的增产节约运动。这个增产节约运动是同全国一切岗位上的人们都有关系的。站在国家事业的各个战线上的青年都应当积极地投入这个运动。
    大家知道，第一个五年计划的七百六十六亿四千万元的投资，用在工业和运输、邮电业的是四百零三亿一千万元，占百分之五十二点六。工业，特别是重工业，是祖国富强的基础。因此，基本建设、地质勘探、厂矿企业、交通运输战线上的占全体职工一半的四百五十万青年对于国家的社会主义工业化的事业担负着十分重大的责任，必须积极参加劳动竞赛，站在增产节约运动的最前列。
    这个战线上的青年应当怎样努力增产节约呢？
    首先就是人人都要勤勤恳恳地劳动。在我们一些青年工人同志中还存在着这么一种观点，似乎只是某些管理人员才有浪费行为，浪费和我无关，这是不对的。请大家来算这样一笔账，假使这一战线的四百五十万青年工人每人每年只缺勤一天，平均每人每天生产的价值只算五元，那就使国家每年损失二千二百五十万元。因此每个青年工人同志都必须具有这样的观念，不好好地劳动，无故缺勤，生产废品次品，随便损坏机器工具，就是极大的浪费。那种一贯诚实地、勤勤恳恳地从事劳动的人，乃是我们的劳动模范，我们的劳动英雄。这种值得尊敬的模范生产者正在不断地涌现出来。例如大连的齐长源同志，他从一九四七年以来，八年半没有缺勤，没有违反过一次劳动纪律，从一九四八年以来，七年半没有出过一次废品，没有丢失或损坏过一件工具。河北微水发电厂汽轮司机权庚禄同志一贯注意操作规程，创造了二千二百二十天安全发电的新纪录。在这条战线上的青年同志人人都应当模范地遵守劳动纪律，努力做到不缺勤、不出废品次品，爱护机器工具，不出任何事故。
    我们的国家一直是竭力提倡创造性的劳动的。创造性的劳动可以打破人们陈旧保守的思想，可以大大地提高劳动生产率。在国民经济恢复时期，已经出现了许许多多富于创造性的先进生产者和先进工作者。五年计划实行以来，这样的同志出现得更多了。青年刨工王崇伦创造了万能工具胎，青年车工陈修林创造了“水箱散热片自动联合机”，青年木工顾思仁创造了多刃平面刨刀，细纱女工吴桂云把皮辊花率降低到百分之零点零九八，柴达木盆地的一支青年钻井队提前一百一十天完成今年的钻井任务。不用说，把全国青年的大大小小的发明创造的成果加到一起，那给国家所创造的财富是相当巨大的。愈来愈多的青年工人同志都希望自己变成这样的先进生产者和先进工作者，这当然是一种很好的现象。但创造性的劳动要建立在熟练劳动的基础上，我们有些同志没有用严肃的态度来对待这件事情，在他们连基本的操作技术都还不熟练、起码的科学知识都还没有具备的时候，就急于求成，想一下子来一个惊人的创造发明，结果不仅没有完成生产任务，反而违反了操作规程，损坏了机器工具，影响了计划的完成。这当然是对国家极端不利的。因此，在这条战线上的青年同志，还应当努力学习技术，提高操作技能，增进科学知识，做到准确地完成工作进度，保证工作质量，同全体职工一道，全面地均衡地完成国家的计划；在这个基础上再苦心钻研，同大家一道，有计划有目的地改进技术，不断地提高劳动生产率。
    自从一九五四年一月首都苏联展览馆建筑工地创立第一个青年突击队以后，青年突击队的组织就在全国各地的建筑工地上逐渐发展起来，接着其他的许多厂矿企业也仿效这种办法，建立了青年先进班、组。据不完全的统计，现在全国基本建设工地和厂矿企业中，共有青年突击队一千五百九十七个，参加的人数达三万一千五百一十八人；又据二十四个省市的统计，青年先进班、组有二千三百一十七个，参加的人数有三万零八百四十二人。这些突击队和先进班、组，在党、行政和工会的领导和关怀之下，绝大部分都能出色地超额完成各种任务。经验证明，这种不打乱整个生产组织并在行政统一管理下的先进生产组织，不仅是鼓舞青年积极分子带头提高生产效率、突破劳动定额、保证完成紧急任务的好形式，而且是影响和教育广大青年工人巩固劳动纪律、发扬团结互助、努力克服困难的一个好办法。我们大家都应当好好地爱护它。我们怎样来爱护这个成长不久的新事物呢？第一，就是所有的突击队和先进班、组，都要随时注意批评和自我批评，加强团结，随时向周围的群众学习，不可骄傲，不可懈怠，要不断努力前进。第二，已经建立起这种先进组织的单位，要继续巩固和发展这些组织。有些地方已经实行了定期召开这些组织的负责人会议、交流经验、检查工作等制度，这对于帮助这些组织的巩固和发展有很大作用，应当加以推广。第三，在还没有这种先进组织的单位，应该积极地发现和培养积极分子，有计划地建立起来，以便用具体的先进榜样带动广大青年前进。第四，对那些极少数匆忙建立起来而又不能起先进作用的组织，必须切实加以整顿，切实加强教育，务必不使任何一个先进组织沦为有名无实，以致败坏整个先进组织的名誉。总之，我们应当使青年突击队和青年先进班、组巩固地健康地发展起来，成为开展增产节约运动的巨大力量。
    节约原材料是我们为国家增加财富的一条宽阔的道路。让我来举两个例子。第一个例子：齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂锻工青年节约小组发起了一个在既不增加工时又保证产品质量前提下，利用残料代替好料的节约活动。从今年一月到五月，他们已经用残料代替了八千六百多公斤好料，共制造出二万八千七百七十四件成品，为国家创造了一万零九百多元的财富。为了迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，他们又一致通过今年下半年再用残料制成六万七千九百五十二件成品，为国家节省一万八千五百九十七公斤好铁，价值共八千元。第二个例子：昂昂溪机务段司机孙士贵同志创造了“快速焚火法”，使他的机车在完成运输任务中降低成本百分之三十左右。“快速焚火法”在全国铁路推广后，已为国家节约了大量燃料，仅就一九五五年估计，至少可节省二十四万吨煤，占全国铁路全年燃料总消耗量的百分之四。所以，决不应当轻视节约原材料的任何一点成就，每一个工人在日常劳动中都注意一点一滴的节约，集中起来就可以为国家创造大量的财富。现在，许多厂矿的青年工人已经提出了切实可行的节约原材料的倡议，开展了节约原材料的群众性的活动。为了开展增产节约运动，就应当把这个活动迅速地广泛地在所有的厂矿企业中开展起来。
    今年五月以来，各地青年工人同志在厉行全面节约的号召下，开展了一个收集遗弃材料的活动。收集遗弃材料的成绩是很大的。仅上海、天津、北京、辽宁、山西、河南、浙江等十七个省市的不完全统计，就一共收集了废钢铁九万多吨，有色金属九百六十七吨，遗弃工具五十六万多件。在增产节约活动中，各地都组织了青年节约队和青年监督岗，仅十七个省市的不完全统计，青年节约队共有六千二百八十三队，参加的人数有三十一万四千多人，青年监督岗有一千一百二十二个，参加的人数有五千一百四十七人。它们的经常工作是，收集各种遗弃材料，传播各种节约经验，帮助行政消除各种浪费现象。巩固地发展青年节约队和青年监督岗的活动，更加充实它们的工作，也是开展增产节约运动的一个好办法。
    工业是国民经济的主脑，农业则是工业发展的基础。工业和农业必须密切配合发展。在第一个五年计划期间，我们的国家要在不削弱工业和运输业的投资的前提下，采取一切办法加速农业的发展。必须着重指明，农业战线是我们青年可以为祖国大显身手的战场。在这条战线上的我国青年将近一万万人。
    那么，我们的国家采取什么最主要的办法来加速农业的发展呢？我国青年在哪些主要问题上可以大显身手呢？
    加速农业发展的根本道路就是加速农业生产合作社的发展。我们的党和毛主席反复教导我们，分散的、细小的小农经济不但不能适应社会主义工业化的发展，而且会自发地生长出资本主义来。最近毛主席在关于农业合作化问题的指示中着重指出：“我们对于工业和农业、社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。”为什么呢？毛主席说：“我国的商品粮食和工业原料的生产水平，现在是很低的，而国家对于这些物资的需要却是一年一年地增大，这是一个尖锐的矛盾。如果我们不能在大约三个五年计划的时期内基本上解决农业合作化的问题，即农业由使用畜力农具的小规模的经营跃进到使用机器的大规模的经营，包括使用机器的国营的大规模的移民垦荒在内（三个五年计划期内，准备垦荒四亿亩至五亿亩），我们就不能解决年年增长的商品粮食和工业原料的需要和现时主要农作物一般产量很低之间的矛盾，我们的社会主义工业化事业就会遇到绝大的困难，我们就不可能完成社会主义工业化。”
      毛主席教导说：“目前农村中合作化的社会改革的高潮，有些地方已经到来，全国也即将到来。这是五亿多农村人口的大规模的社会主义的革命运动，带有极其伟大的世界意义。”开展农业合作化运动的结果，将使我国农村的面貌发生根本的变化。广大农民们逐步地改变他们几千年来所习惯的私有的小生产者的生活，这种生活曾是他们遭受剥削和贫穷的根源，他们一步步摆脱这种生活，就会一步步走向永远的共同富裕和共同幸福的生活。
    我们的党把农村中的广大青年团员和青年积极分子看作是实现农业合作化的一支可以依靠的突击力量。农村的青年团员和青年积极分子们用事实表明了自己的确是这样的一支突击力量。在现有的六十五万个农业生产合作社中，有青年一千七百万人，其中担任社长、副社长、社务委员、会计、生产队长、技术员等职务的骨干分子有二百九十万人。他们绝大多数都是忠实于集体利益的坚强的战士。在我们的大会上坐着的孙显忠、徐建春、戴占元、任焕孩、刘炳文、白云翔、牛贵芝、邓祚荣、阳希贤等人，就是这条战线上的出色的同志。
      我们的党已经全面地规划了实现农业合作化的伟大计划：要在第一个五年计划最后一年的末尾和第二个五年计划第一年的开头，把全国五千五百万农户、即全国农户的一半组织到半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社中来；要在第二个五年计划时期内，把其余一半的五千五百万农户基本上组织起来；要在第三个五年计划时期内，把这种半社会主义性质的合作社推向到完全社会主义性质的合作社，并大规模地使用机器操作。
      为了迎接在全国农村中新的社会主义群众运动的高潮，农村中的青年团员和青年积极分子应该站在这个高潮的前列，动员和说服自己的家庭积极入社，按照自愿互利的原则努力办社，为建设社会主义的新农村而努力奋斗。
    参加了农业生产合作社，农民就从一家一户分散地从事劳动，改变为有组织地从事集体劳动；农民就不只是考虑一家一户的利害，而要经常考虑到集体的公共的利害，这就表明农村中的生活正在发生着很大的变化。对于这种变化，青年人显然是更善于适应的。事实表明，许多青年人能够很好地团结群众，身体力行，做农村中的社会主义新风气的倡导人。合作社的经营管理比个体农民的家务要复杂好多倍。搞好经营管理，对于合作社的巩固有决定意义。这里需要老一辈人的经验和智慧，也需要青年人的锐气和各种新的知识。许多青年人做了合作社的骨干分子，并不是偶然的。我们青年人应当更好地努力，更虚心地学习，使我们能够对合作社的建设和巩固起更大的作用。
    现在许多农村已经提出了“做一个好社员”的口号，得到了广大青年社员的热烈响应。我们应该把这个口号变成全国农村青年的口号。怎样才算是好社员呢？那就是要带头勤勤恳恳地劳动，用各种办法使合作社增产，就是要模范地爱护公共财产，以大公无私的精神坚决贯彻互利政策，就是要以百折不挠的精神克服困难，敢于向一切违犯社的利益的行为作斗争。这个好社员的光荣称号要由谁来定呢？当然不能自封，也不能由某个干部或报纸记者来指定，而是要合作社的男女老少公认。我们热烈希望所有的青年社员都为做一个好社员而努力奋斗，让人们看到，由中国共产党和毛主席所教养出来的小伙子，确确实实是我们合作社里的好样子。
    为了加速农业的发展，为了推动农业合作化运动，农村青年还要用其他许多办法为增加生产而奋斗。
    在提高耕作技术方面，青年可以起很大的作用。在这里我们只着重提出几件青年可以普遍而大量做的事。第一是选留、培育和推广优良品种，学会和推广先进的农业技术。这两年，河北、山西、河南、辽宁、吉林、广西等地的许多农村青年，发动了玉米人工去雄授粉的运动，每一亩产量约增加十五斤。南方产稻区正大力推广改种双季稻，能使每亩产量由六、七百斤增加到一千多斤；出席这次大会的福建省的黄海澄同志领导的农业合作社，去年每亩田平均产稻一千三百六十斤。许多产棉区已经实行了深耕细作、合理施肥、合理密植、除治病虫、整枝打杈等先进的生产方法，增产很多。这些方法，青年们都应该带头推广。第二是努力增加肥料，改变目前很多耕地施肥不足的现象。目前我国化学肥料生产数量很小，我们应该用自己的双手去增加肥料，首先是充分利用粪肥。我国东北和南方许多地方没有厕所，粪肥丢弃很多，这些地方的青年应该带头修厕所、修猪圈、修牛栏来积肥。增加肥料的另一个重要办法是压绿肥，缺少草的地方就先种草再割草压肥。河南省青年提出了“向青草进军，开展一个千车万担的割草积肥运动”，作为向我们大会的献礼，六个专区的青年突击队和青年到八月上旬已经积肥六十七万多车。四川南溪县石盘乡组织了二十二支青年突击队，五天内就积肥四十四万多斤。此外，利用塘泥、炕土、房土、扫街、垫圈等办法，也可以增加许多肥料。第三是同病害虫害和兽害作斗争。河北省沙河、邱县两县在今年五月发动了三万多青年，在所有的棉花地边和道路旁开展了一次除草防蚜运动，除草六百九十五万斤，大大减少了蚜虫的发生。水稻产区的治螟工作更是增产的重要因素。福建省诏安县港头乡农业生产合作社青年突击队发动一百四十九人，利用点灯诱蛾的办法，消灭螟蛾四万二千多只。贵州省苗族青年罗学方的打兽队勇敢除兽，保护了庄稼。这些都是我们行动的榜样。第四是精打细收，颗粒还家。在农作物的收割中抛撒的粮食是不少的。如果以平均每亩损耗三斤五斤计算，全国约十五亿亩秋季作物就会损失四十五亿到七十五亿斤粮食，这些粮食可供九百万到一千五百万人吃一年。这是多么惊人的一笔损失。今年我们提出发动农村青少年在秋收中开展减少粮食、棉花损耗的活动，各地都热烈地响应了这个号召。据河北省涿县等五个县的消息，那些县的青年们在九月初已经从耕地上多收了四十五万斤粮食。又据九月二十日中国青年报上消息：据河南报告，河南光山县团委在八月三十一日召开了全县青年突击队长、拣粮队长会议，会后，全县二百二十个乡都召开了青年积极分子大会，并以合作社和社的生产队为单位，组织了六十五个拣粮队，三十五个检查组和五十五个细收细打队，共有四万一千六百个青少年参加。现已从地上拣回了稻谷五十万零六千斤。我们一定要把这个工作广泛地深入地开展起来。农业技术推广站的青年要努力学习农业科学，学习农民的生产经验，积极宣传和推广先进农业技术。国营农场、牧场里的青年要带头学习先进技术，使生产能够获利，充分发挥国营企业的示范作用。
    积极地有计划地开荒是我国增加农业生产的一个极有前途的办法。几千年来，我们的祖先把十六万万亩荒地变成了耕地，留下的十五万万亩荒地还在那里睡大觉。青年们应当坚决带头组织开荒。北京市青年志愿垦荒队说得好：我们中国青年一定不能让那些荒地长期睡觉，长期长野草，一定要叫它们长粮食，要它们为社会主义服务。我们的国家不但有大片荒地在边疆地区等待着我们去开垦，就是在人口稠密的内地，也有不少荒地还在那里睡觉。如浙江省宁波等五个专区，坡度在三十度以下的荒地就有三十余万亩。为了开垦这些近距离的荒地，不少地区的青年在党的统一组织下已经行动起来，浙江省杭州等县市的一千二百余名青年已经到本省的金华专区去垦荒。还有不少青年把村边地边、房前屋后的空地也开垦起来了，连许多地方的少年先锋队员也利用小块空地种植了许多向日葵。对边疆地区，用开荒队的形式去开荒，既可以比成家的移民大大节省国家的投资，又可以一下子就组成坚强的高级形式的农业生产合作社。自从北京市第一支青年垦荒队出发后，团中央和各省市团委已经接到了几万封要求参加垦荒的信。这些信里面充满着对祖国的无限热爱，充满着建设社会主义的坚强信念。其中有一位青年在信里是这样恳求的，他说：“亲爱的同志，我可以追上他们吗？我坚决请求参加他们的队伍，和他们一道向困难进军。我过去是一个病夫，三天两头病一次，经过长期锻炼，现在好了。我敢保证，我绝不会落后于他们。”现在该是我们率领这些朝气蓬勃的青年人前进的时候了。
    青年们还应当积极参加兴修水利。目前我国每年还有几千万亩土地遭受水旱灾害，我们设法减轻一些灾害，就等于每年增产好几亿斤粮食。几年来的事实证明，我们青年是水利建设中的一支突击力量。在治淮工程中，每年都有上百万的青年在辛勤地劳动着。他们和其他民工同志一道，筑起了钢墙铁壁般的堤坝，打开了高山，筑起了水库。他们中间涌现出了大批英雄模范人物。在安徽省的治淮功臣模范中，百分之五十以上是青年；全省工地上的六百零九个青年突击队和青年班、组，绝大部分能出色地完成和超额完成工程任务。在一九五四年和特大洪水的斗争中，我们青年又一次表现了忠于人民、不怕困难的英雄气概。有些青年为了战胜洪水，献出了自己宝贵的生命，他们的事迹将永远鼓舞着我们青年前进。小型农田水利对增加农业生产也有巨大意义。全国绝大部分土地都可以兴修水利进行灌溉，而现在进行灌溉的只有四亿七千万亩，其中小型农田水利为数很大。兴修小型农田水利的方法很多，如整修渠道、筑塘坝、修小型水库、打井等等。去年广东省开平县龙塘乡青年组织了九十余人的打井队，五天就打井八十二眼。我们农村青年都应当积极参加兴修小型农田水利的工作。
    为了增加生产，我国青年还要在林业建设中大大出力，展开一个广泛的植树造林活动。我们祖国的面积将近一千万平方公里，但是已耕地和可耕地只占二百万平方公里，森林的面积只占五十万平方公里。几年来，我国造林事业已有很大发展，许多山地和沙原已经是“穷山变成了花果山，沙滩变成了米粮川”。在五年计划中，国家将有计划地营造大批的经济林、防护林，配合治黄、治淮等大型水利工程，建造大批水源林，提倡群众性的植树造林、护林防火工作，全国青年应当踊跃参加。我们这一代应当下定这么一个宏大的志愿：用自己的双手把我们伟大祖国绿化起来。我们青少年可以在植树造林中做许多事情：如收集和采集树种、培育苗圃、组织造林育林、护林防火小组等。我国青年和少年共有一亿八千六百万人，如果每人每年种活一棵树，平均每亩一百二十棵，每年就可以造林一百五十五万亩。过去几年内，许多地方青少年的植树造林和护林活动有了很大成绩，今后我们要把这一活动更广泛更深入地开展起来。
    青年们也应当关心发展畜牧业。发展畜牧业可以增加畜力，可以增加肥料，可以增加皮毛，可以增加肉类，可以增加收入。农业区和牧业区的青年都应当关心畜牧业的发展，学习畜牧和配种技术，学习饲养管理，以增加牲畜的头数和提高牲畜质量。在座的蒙古族青年花达嘎新疆柯尔克孜族青年吐尔逊尼牙孜等同志就是在牧畜工作中有出色成绩的劳动模范。浙江省东阳县农场养猪女工华银凤不嫌脏、不怕累，热爱自己的职业，创造了定时定量、分群管理、合理配料、注意清洁卫生等饲养方法，提高了毛猪的生产率。这是值得大家学习的。凡是有益于人民的事情，我们每个青年都应当热情积极地不讲价钱地去把它做好。
      此外，做好国营商业和合作社营商业的工作，扩大商品流通，加速资金周转，降低流通费用，对于发展社会主义工业建设和农业合作化运动是有重要意义的。活跃在商业战线上的青年职工们已有很多好的经验，他们应当继续努力。手工业中的青年应该积极地为手工业的合作化而努力。
    在私营工商业企业中工作的青年职工同样是为社会主义奋斗的光荣的战斗员。他们同样要努力增产节约，为国家建设事业尽力。他们还要和广大职工一道，认真监督资本主义工商业接受社会主义改造。没有对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，就不能完成社会主义工业化，也会妨害农业合作化运动的进行。我们的党教导我们说，由于大势所趋，由于祖国有着伟大的前途，在资产阶级中的那些能看清前途的爱国分子，是会愿意接受社会主义改造的，对于他们必须采取欢迎的态度。但是对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造绝不会是风平浪静的，而是一场复杂尖锐的阶级斗争。资产阶级中的一部分顽固分子用抽逃资金、偷工减料、偷税漏税、挑拨离间、造谣生事、破坏工人阶级团结等等办法来抗拒社会主义改造。从生活上勾引和腐蚀青年，也是他们惯用的一种恶毒手段。每一个在私营工商业企业中工作的青年都应当站稳工人阶级的立场，对于这部分资产阶级中的不法分子的恶毒行为，必须按照国家的政策法令，同他们作坚决的斗争。
    如果认为工业和农业方面的重大任务只是同在生产战线上、经济部门内工作的同志有关，当然是不对的。从事政治工作、科学工作、文教工作的同志做好自己的工作，也对社会主义工业化和社会主义的改造事业起积极作用。节约也必须是一个全民的运动，我们的党向我们指出，在全国范围内实行严格的节约制度，是我国人民在建设社会主义社会和共产主义社会过程中的经常任务。我们青年应当在一切方面积极地参加节约运动。
    同志们，我们必须看到，建设社会主义工业和发展农业合作化运动乃是一个伟大的革命运动，我们要大大发展我国的社会生产力，我们还必须改革以私有制为基础的生产关系和社会经济制度。没有这种生产关系和社会经济制度的改革，社会生产力的发展是不可能的。我们今天所进行的事业是由工人阶级领导的、消灭一切剥削阶级的社会革命，我们今天所进行的斗争，是我国历史上从来没有过的极其尖锐、剧烈而又复杂的斗争。为了把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，我们一定要战胜一切国内外的敌人，我们还一定要克服一切和社会主义不相容的从私有制度中产生的各种旧的习惯、成见、风尚和思想。当我们努力参加社会主义工业建设和农业合作化运动的时候，我们就是做着我们的前人从未做过的翻天覆地的事业。我们这一代的青年能够在我们的党和毛主席的领导下，和全国人民在一起为完成这个伟大事业而奋斗，是无限光荣的。我们必须努力。
    学习文化，掌握技术，向科学进军
    我国人民已经成为国家的主人，正在从事伟大的社会主义建设工作。为了能管好国家的一切事情，为了能做好社会主义建设工作，我国人民必须成为有文化的人。有了文化就能够取得各种新的知识，就能够掌握先进的科学技术。我们的党教导我们，如果没有先进的科学技术，就不可能建成社会主义。在旧社会，剥削阶级力求垄断文化和科学，使广大的劳动人民陷在愚昧和无知中。现在我们应当使文化、科学掌握在工人、农民和一切劳动者的手中。
    向文化进军、向科学进军是落在我们这一代青年身上的一个极其重大的历史任务。这是一个很严重的任务。旧中国造成了广大人民文化水平很低、科学技术落后的状况，许多青年过去连最基本的文化都没有机会学习。我们必须在这种困难条件下一步步前进。我们一定要像同敌人作战一样地顽强努力，来征服文化和科学的一个个堡垒。
    首先，我国广大青年都应当努力学习普通的文化。没有普通的文化，就谈不上去夺取什么科学堡垒。军事堡垒周围是有一层鹿砦的，科学堡垒的周围也有一层鹿砦，这就是普通文化。战士攻打军事堡垒，总是要先把鹿砦这个障碍扫除，现在我们攻打科学堡垒，也要像战士一样，首先就要把普通文化这个鹿砦扫除掉。
    不识字和文化低的广大青年是懂得学习文化的重要性的。他们说：“说一千，说一万，没有文化不好办”；“用手算工票，计账画道道，没有文化受不了”；“合作社，真正好，没有文化办不好”。新中国的青年都要下定决心，至少学到能写、能算、能读报，并且在这个基础上不断地提高自己的文化水平，使我们成为社会主义建设的积极的战士。
    要得到普通的文化知识，最好的办法当然是从小就到学校中去念书。但是决不能认为，只有在正规的小学和中学中才可能学到文化。现在我国初级中学和小学的在校学生共五千八百四十一万多人，超过国民党时代的最高数字一倍多。在第一个五年计划期间，初级中学在校学生将增加为三百九十八万三千人，小学在校学生将增加为六千零二十三万人。但是由于我们的国家要用巨大的资金来发展工业，由于师资不够，培养足够的师资需要相当时间；而且我国工业和农业的生产队伍中目前就需要有大批的具有初步文化水平的人参加。所以在一定的时期内，还不可能使全国每一个青年、少年统统上小学，更不可能使每个人都上完初级中学。许多在学校中学了一个时期后不可能继续求学的青年，以及许多已经过了进小学的年龄而还缺乏基本文化的青年，就应当利用各种条件，一面从事生产劳动，一面获得文化知识和继续提高文化。我们的国家也为他们创造了许多有利的条件，例如，国家已经大量地举办了工农业余学校，并且有计划地举办高小和初中毕业学生的自学小组以及在城市中设立文化补习学校等。一九五四年全国参加工农业余学校学习的青年约有一千九百万人，城市中高小和初中毕业生以及社会青年参加自学小组和文化补习学校学习的有五十多万人。
    有人问，在生产劳动中能不能够获得文化和继续提高文化呢？广大青年已经用事实来答复了这个问题。这方面的事例非常之多，这里举一个典型的例子。辽宁省复县沙坨村，全村有二百零六名男女青年，经过几年来的努力，已有一百九十一人达到了初小以上的水平，其余的十五名青年中，现在坚持在常年民校学习的有十四人，只有一人因为孩子太多没有参加学习。像这样的可以算是扫除了青年文盲的村子，在吉林、山东、四川、河北、山西、湖南等省都有一些。大家知道，有些同志小时并没有上过什么学，在进了工厂、到了军队之后，由于努力学习，不但认识了字，而且还写出了文学作品。军队里的高玉宝、崔八娃，工厂里的沈虎根、李学鳌、就是这样的同志。在座的赵质培同志原来只念了五年书，现在已经成为一个青年科学工作者。徐人武同志经过七年自学，已经从高小程度提高到了相当于大学的水平。
    我们应当在广大工农青年中认真展开扫除文盲的运动。不识字的青年，一定要自觉地把文化学好，要下个决心，定个计划，在三五年之内不再做“睁眼的瞎子”。不识字的青年团员更要积极带头。有了一些文化的青年，不但要继续努力提高文化，还要主动积极地帮助不识字的或文化水平比自己低的同伴进行学习。要知道，把自己学得的东西献给自己的同志，这就是革命友爱的一种表现。参加业余学校和自学小组的青年都要深刻认识学习的目的性，都要模范地遵守学习纪律，使这些学习组织迅速地巩固和发展起来。一切团的基层组织都要把关心青年学习文化和帮助他们提高文化的担子担当起来，切实地协助政府办好业余学校和自学小组，耐心地动员和组织广大青年自觉自愿地去努力学习文化，使青年团真正成为扫除文盲传播文化的一支主要队伍。
    在农村中有文化的青年负有很重要的责任。旧中国的广大农村处于极端贫穷的文化落后的悲惨状况，当时有许多人抱着这样的想法：一个青年既然识字读书，就不值得再留在交通闭塞的农村里，就不值得在风里雨里下苦力。这种陈腐的看法现在应当为新中国的一切青年人和一切关心青年前途的人所唾弃。必须知道，我国的农村现在已经成为新的农村，并且将随着合作化运动的展开而成为完全新的农村，那就是有文化的、富裕的社会主义农村。为了达到这个目的，就需要许多有文化的青年在农村里工作。在农村里，小学毕业生、初中毕业生以及其他有一定文化水平的青年不但可以用自己的文化知识来为农业生产和合作社的建设服务，而且能够成为在农村中进行文化建设的基本力量。许多农村依靠这种力量，在党和政府的领导下，建立了农村俱乐部、农村剧团、农村图书室、黑板报、读报组、收音站等等，开展了各种适合当地需要的群众业余文化艺术活动。使文化普及到农村中去是建设新农村的一个重要的方面，也是提高我国文化的一个重要方面。农村中的青年知识分子应当在这方面起巨大的作用。
    对于一切在学校里学习的青年，我们希望他们努力学习，力求掌握各种专门知识和各门科学，准备离开学校后能够很好地为祖国的社会主义事业服务。大家知道，我们的国家每年都要拿出大量的资金来办学校，这部分资金约占国家财政全部支出的百分之七到百分之八。我国的各级学校都在不断发展着。除了小学和初级中学外，我国的高级中学、中等专业学校和高等学校的学生，现在已经有一百四十余万人。几年来，全国学生在党和国家的亲切关怀下，得到了从来没有过的全面发展的机会。他们清楚地看到了祖国无限光明的前途，深深体会到生活在毛泽东时代的幸福，因而更加向往和热爱社会主义。他们热烈响应毛主席的“三好”的号召，在学习成绩、健康状况、政治觉悟、道德品质等各方面都有了极大的进步。这是非常可喜的现象。
    我们的党期望着每一个同学都成为新型的知识分子。这种新型的知识分子不仅要具有现代的科学知识，具有坚强的体质，而且最基本的也是最重要的，还要具有高度的政治觉悟，也就是社会主义觉悟。国家所需要的知识分子干部不是那种一有了些专门知识以后就瞧不起劳动人民，不能和人民群众同甘苦、共呼吸的旧式的知识分子，而是热爱劳动人民，在工作中和人民群众保持密切的联系，能够在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中坚定地站在工人阶级立场上，忠诚地为社会主义事业奋斗到底的新型知识分子。
    现在，在我国的高等学校、中等专业学校和高级中学中，工农出身的学生所占比例已越来越多，这是一种好的现象。不断地增加工农出身的具有高级专门知识的知识分子，对于我们的国家建设的发展有重要的意义。我们希望这些同学认识到这一点而加倍地努力。在学生中还有一部分是从剥削阶级或反动家庭出身的，我们也希望他们能够成为自觉的社会主义的建设者。我们从来不把出身于剥削阶级或反动家庭的知识青年同他们的家庭混同起来。党和国家对青年知识分子的期望是没有例外的。但是这一部分同学必须认识，由于自己出身的关系，就更容易沾染剥削阶级思想、甚至反动思想。因而他们更应当努力在政治上锻炼自己，忠实地接受党的教育，坚决地同反动思想和一切剥削阶级思想划清界限。
    对于一切在工作和技术上有专长的青年，我们希望他们努力把自己培养成为各行各业的专家。现在，在我国经济战线上有几十万个青年技术人员和大量的青年技术工人，在教育战线上有一百多万青年教师，在经济、政治、文化机关里有二百万以上的青年干部。这些同志由于党和国家的培养，由于自己的努力，绝大部分进步很快。虽然他们现在一般地知识还不够，经验还不多，还说不上是专家，但是只要他们努力，他们是有条件成为各项工作岗位上的真正的专家的，他们中的很多人是能够成为向科学进军的先锋战士的。他们应当努力做好自己的岗位上的工作，钻研并精通专业的科学知识，不断地提高自己的学识和能力。
    大家知道，现在人类已经进入原子时代，世界科学的发展真是日新月异。我们要建设社会主义，就要掌握现代最新的、最复杂的、最高级的科学技术。我国不仅需要千千万万个精通一般的先进科学技术的各行各业的专业人材，而且需要成千成万个精通高级的科学技术的人材；不仅需要某几种专家和专门人材，而且需要几千种专家和专门人材。我们许多同志都怀着宏大的志向，想把自己培养成为精通本行的专家，这是很好的，这正是我们党和国家所殷切期望的。
    那么，应该走什么样的道路才能达到这个目的呢？有两条道路。一条是我们党和毛主席所指示的道路，这就是，必须积极地向一切内行的人虚心学习，拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆架子。不要骄傲自满。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，刻苦用功地继续学习。这是唯一正确的道路，是一条大有出息的道路，我们大家应当走这条道路。
    但是还有另外一条道路。这就是，或者把自己已经学到的一点东西夸大起来，认为再不需要向老一辈请教了，更不需要向普通的人领教了；或者是对已经取得的一点成就满足起来，认为这样就可以凑合过去了，再也用不着前进了；或者是当组织分配做一个具体工作的时候，认为是“大材小用”，“浪费了自己的青春”。这当然是一条要完全碰壁的道路，是一条极端危险的道路。我们的党希望我们大家都不走这条道路。让我们大家都来说：我们决不走这样的道路。
    在我们的大会上，坐着许多年轻的优秀干部和专门人才，包括工业、农业、运输业、商业、财经、政治、军事、科学、教育、卫生、文学、艺术、体育等各个战线上的。我们相信他们和在这些战线上工作的一切青年同志们是不会辜负党对他们的热烈的期望的。希望他们今后为祖国作出更多的贡献，为祖国创造更大的荣誉。
    我们还应当指出，我们青年所要学习的科学有很多门类，对于各种专门的科学，一般说来，每个人只能精通一门。但是有一门科学却是人人都应当学习的，那就是马克思列宁主义。我们应当记住斯大林的教导：“有一个科学部门的知识，却是所有一切科学部门中的布尔什维克所必须具备的，这就是马克思列宁主义关于社会、社会发展规律、无产阶级革命发展规律、社会主义建设事业发展规律以及共产主义胜利的科学。”
    马克思列宁主义能够帮助我们开扩眼界，明辨是非，预察前途，加强信念。我们要使自己成为自觉的社会主义建设者，就应当努力学习马克思列宁主义，用马克思列宁主义关于社会发展规律的科学来武装自己。有的同志迫切要求自己成为某种科学的专家，就把学习马克思列宁主义看作似乎是多余的负担，这是错误的。也有的同志以为自己文化较低，无法学习马克思列宁主义，这也是不对的。固然，要精通马克思列宁主义不能不有一定的文化程度，但是理解马克思列宁主义的基本观点，对于许多工农青年来说，都是完全可以做得到的。青年团组织应当善于采用多种的形式来进行马克思列宁主义的教育。我们的党和国家的政策法令文件是马克思列宁主义的具体化，因此我们应当大力组织青年阅读报纸，使广大青年通过报纸上对各项政策法令的解释来学到马克思列宁主义的基本知识。对于一切有一定文化水平的青年说来，有系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论都是必要的。我们的党近一年来领导进行了对资产阶级唯心主义的批判，大大提高了广大青年对学习马克思列宁主义理论的重视。有些青年同志积极地参加了这场思想斗争。我们的党期望从知识青年中产生大批的理论干部来加强党的理论战线。我们相信，许多知识青年一定会朝着我们党所期望的目标努力前进。
    提高革命警惕性，保卫祖国的社会主义建设
    我们的党教导我们，我国进行社会主义建设有着极其有利的条件。伟大的苏联是我国最可靠最忠实的朋友，苏联用伟大的友谊，给了我国工业化以巨大的、全面的、真诚无私的帮助。中国人民把苏联人民当作自己的最好的老师，中国青年也把苏联青年当作自己的最好的榜样。各人民民主国家同样是我国忠实可靠的朋友，他们也给了我国以兄弟般的支援。还有许多友好的国家，他们以同情和善意的态度同我国和平友好地共处。全世界人民都以欢欣和期待的心情看到我们的胜利。中国人民和中国青年对于世界各国人民和青年的友谊是十分重视的。为什么我国的社会主义建设一定会胜利呢？这不单因为我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导，有六万万人民的伟大力量，而且因为我们的事业是正义的事业，是同地球上最大多数人民的利益休戚相关的，我们和全世界人民，全世界人民和我们，是紧紧地站在一起的。这样的事业当然是无往而不胜利的。
    但是我们的党警告我们，切不可因此麻痹大意，用万事大吉的“无敌”观念来解除我们的武装。因为第一，世界上还有极端仇视我们的帝国主义侵略集团；第二，台湾还有蒋介石卖国集团；第三，大陆上已被打倒和将被消灭的阶级中还有坚决的反革命分子。帝国主义者、蒋介石卖国集团和暗藏的反革命分子，他们勾结在一起用尽一切办法企图破坏我们每一件社会主义的工作，他们天天盘算着如何恢复过去骑在我国人民头上的罪恶统治。为了我们幸福美好的前途，我们一天也不能放松对敌人的警惕，一刻也不能放松对敌人的斗争。
    美国的帝国主义分子硬说中国人民要侵略别的国家和别的民族，这种无耻的造谣诬蔑是没落的社会势力的惯技。大家知道，任何没落的快要死亡的社会势力总是只能用欺骗人民的办法来维持自己的生存。中华人民共和国的社会制度决定了我们绝对不会也绝对不需要靠侵略别人来过活。中国人民不要同任何国家作战，愿意同全世界一切民族和平友好，包括美国在内。中国青年愿意同全世界一切国家的青年亲密地携手，包括美国青年在内。
    我们在这里必须指出，如果有人以为中国人民一贯主张各国和平相处是因为我们软弱无能的缘故，那就大错特错了。谁要想在中国人民的身上动手动脚，谁就不能不准备受到事实的教训。中国人民对保卫自己的国家是有经验的，也是有力量的。侵略者应当小心他们的头在中国人民的铜墙铁壁上撞得粉碎。
    我国的政府正在同苏联政府和各人民民主国家的政府一起，为和缓国际紧张局势而作着有效的努力。国际侵略势力企图利用盘踞台湾的蒋介石匪帮分割我国的领土，对我国实施威胁，并且在远东制造紧张局势，这是我们所绝对不能容许的。中国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾。我们一分钟也不能忘记我们的台湾同胞。台湾一天没有重归伟大祖国的怀抱，我们的斗争一天不会停止。
    为了维护我们伟大祖国的领土主权的安全和完整，我们的国家要大力巩固国防，建设国防力量。新中国青年在这方面担负着特别重大的责任。
    我们国家已经颁布兵役法，开始实行义务兵役制，全国广大青年表示衷心的拥护。拥护兵役法，根据法律履行兵役义务，是我们青年保卫祖国、保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的崇高愿望的具体实现。我们要向我们的亲爱的祖国保证：我们随时随刻准备着接受您的召唤。除了服兵役以外，我们还应当经常地注意锻炼身体，学习军事知识，以便能更持久地为祖国劳动，更顽强地保卫祖国。为此，青年团组织应当提倡青年人讲卫生，在青年中广泛开展体育活动，有步骤地组织青年参加系统的“劳卫制”锻炼和开展国防体育活动。开展体育活动是党和毛主席要我们青年团大力组织的一项对祖国有深远意义的工作。
    我们青年还应当从各方面来支持我国的国防力量和国防建设。努力生产，做好国家的各项工作，都是对国防力量的一种支援。此外，我们青年还要通过各种方式爱护和支持人民解放军。我们应当继续发扬在长期革命战争中养成的军民合作的优良传统，我们应当继续发扬关心和帮助军人家属和烈士家属的优良传统，我们应当对复员的军人在工作、学习和生活上给以热情的帮助。
    人民解放军和人民志愿军的青年要百倍地提高警惕，模范地完成上级交予的任务，要努力学习现代化的军事技术，严格遵守各种条令和纪律。我们军队中的青年，历来都是全国青年的模范，广大青年从人民解放军和人民志愿军的无数英雄的事迹中学习到了崇高的爱国主义和革命英雄主义。我们的大会上坐着一百五十多位军队的勇士，我们应当特别欢迎他们。
    我们的党教导我们，我们的国家今天不仅有公开的敌人，而且还存在着暗藏的反革命分子。暗藏的反革命分子乃是我们最危险的敌人。暗藏的反革命分子之所以特别危险，因为他们是隐藏在我们的身边、钻进到我们的肝脏里的敌人。党号召我们，一定要用最大的决心，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们肃清。肃清反革命分子的斗争是保卫祖国社会主义建设的神圣斗争。一切热爱祖国的青年都必须投入这个伟大的斗争。是的，我们青年已经忠勇地投入了这场斗争。我们的大会上就坐着几十个这样的优秀同志。
    肃清反革命分子的斗争对我们青年还有特殊深刻的意义。因为反革命分子总是利用我们青年人的弱点，用一切欺骗办法勾引青年上当。有的青年有时还有贪图生活享受的缺点，反革命分子就从生活上用各种卑鄙办法引诱他们走邪路，用道德败坏的行为来腐蚀他们。有的青年自命不凡，不切实际地企图一举成名，反革命分子就向他们大施谄媚，使他们感到“怀才不遇”，以至把反革命分子看作知己，而同革命组织疏远甚至对立。有的青年为了某种个人的打算，向组织隐瞒了自己历史中的什么事情，反革命分子抓住了这个把柄，就逼使他们干危害国家和人民的勾当。青年人一般地是经历不多，政治上比较幼稚，所以反革命分子在青年人身上千方百计地寻找进攻的罅隙。由此可见，肃清反革命分子的斗争，对于我们青年来说，又是保卫自己的政治生命的斗争，保卫自己健全地成长为祖国社会主义事业的坚强战士的斗争。
    反革命分子的恶毒阴谋是注定要失败的。新中国的青年是在伟大的中国共产党领导下的有组织的、有社会主义觉悟的青年，而且我们青年的组织性和政治觉悟正在不断地提高，这就是反革命分子不能够为所欲为而我们能够肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的根本原因。我们必须在广大青年中继续提高组织性和提高政治觉悟来战胜一切反革命分子。
    广大青年已经从实际生活中深切体会到组织的重要性。如果我们是散漫的，没有组织的，那么虽然有千百万人，敌人也很容易把我们各个击破。但在我们千百万人严密地组织了起来的时候，我们就有了无穷无尽的力量。组织给我们每一个人以勇气和力量，我们每一个人都有责任来巩固和加强组织。纪律就是加强组织的一个重要的武器。在工作中和斗争中严格地遵守国家的纪律，遵守社会生活中的纪律，遵守革命团体中的纪律，是我们对于集体应有的义务。
    各种反革命分子竭力诋毁我们的组织性，他们说我们的组织和纪律妨害了个人的发展，还说什么只有平庸的人才会严格地遵守纪律。新中国的青年知道，这种胡言乱语只是证明了我们的组织性和纪律性是我们的敌人所十分害怕和极端仇视的。我们的组织和纪律以人民的公共利益为基础。我们越是尊重组织，遵守纪律，就越是能按照人民的利益来充分发挥个人的才能。我们知道，只有严格地遵守纪律，才能使自己密切地生活在伟大的集体中间，因而才能感到自己是真正坚强有力。反之，如果我们站在同纪律相对立的地位，那么我们就只会感觉到自己是软弱、渺小的。我们的集体生活不但不是对个人的束缚，而且是保障了不受压迫和剥削的真正的个人自由，保障了个人才能的多方面的发展。我们一定要同任何破坏我们的组织和纪律的思想和行动作斗争，十分自觉地加强我们的组织性和纪律性，这样，我们才能够在建设社会主义的伟大事业中取得胜利，粉碎一切的敌人。
    同志们，现在让我们来谈一谈提高社会主义觉悟的问题。我们每一个人必须努力提高自己的社会主义觉悟。这不仅是为了同反革命分子斗争，而且也是我们在一切方面的活动的基础。什么叫做社会主义建设积极分子呢？从根本上说来，这就是那些具有高度的社会主义觉悟的人。社会主义觉悟可以说是我们的“灵魂”，一个没有“灵魂”的工作者不能成为好的工作者。只有不断地提高社会主义觉悟的人，才能在生产战线上不断创造新的成绩，才能以坚强的毅力向文化和科学进军，才能无限忠诚地为保卫祖国而斗争，才能高度自觉地遵守纪律，时时刻刻保持革命警惕性。
    我们对于伟大的社会主义事业抱有充分的信心。我们坚定地相信我们所从事的是崇高的正义的事业，相信这个事业是一定能够胜利的。反革命分子竭力企图使我们精神涣散。他们利用任何一点风吹草动来恐吓我们，企图证明我们将遇到不可克服的困难，说我们的事业终于会失败。但是反革命分子决不能动摇抱有坚定信念的人。为什么我们能有这样坚定的信念呢？这就是因为我们的信念是建筑在对社会历史规律的科学认识上的。社会历史的发展有它的客观规律，这是不因人们的意志而转移的。根据客观历史规律，根据阶级斗争发展的规律，共产主义不但一定要在中国实现，而且一定要在全世界实现。我们学会用阶级分析的方法看各种事情，认识了历史发展的客观规律，就能科学地认识到社会主义、共产主义在中国取得完全胜利的必然性，并且看到实现这种必然性是最符合于中国广大人民的利益的，而一切前进中的困难都是能够克服，也是必须克服的。因此我们的信念无论怎样也不会动摇。提高我们的社会主义觉悟，就是要不断地增强这种以科学的认识为基础的坚定信念。
    提高社会主义觉悟，同时又是要我们以共产主义的道德标准来要求自己。我们既然对于社会主义事业有完全的信心，我们就要尽一切力量来为这个事业奋斗。我们是言行一致的，是理论和实践一致的。对于我们说来，什么是好的行为，什么是坏的行为呢？永远消灭人剥削人的现象，建成以劳动人民的互助合作关系为基础的社会就是好的行为；反之，自私自利，只顾自己的利益而损害他人和公共的利益，以剥削他人为生就是恶劣的应当唾弃的行为。我们热爱我们的祖国，热爱人民的共同事业，愿意为了祖国的利益和人民的共同事业而贡献出一切力量。对于国内各民族，我们平等相待，兄弟手足一样地团结在一起。我们的爱国主义和国际主义精神紧相结合，我们关心和支持世界各国人民的进步事业，热爱其他一切国家的人民和青年。我们诚实地从事劳动，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务。我们时时刻刻关心社会的公共利益，自觉地爱护公共财产；我们密切地联系群众，坚决地保卫人民的利益，而同一切违反人民利益的事情进行不调和的斗争。这些都是我们的共产主义道德行为的具体表现。这些也就是在我们广大青年积极分子中日益发扬起来的新的道德品质。毛主席曾指出，真正共产主义者的精神就是“毫无自私自利之心的精神”；毛主席教导我们说：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”提高社会主义觉悟也就在于要使我们成为具有这样的共产主义精神的人。
    由此可见，为了提高我们的社会主义觉悟，我们就应当结合着中国革命的实际学习马克思列宁主义关于社会发展规律的科学知识，并且努力在实际斗争中不断地锻炼自己。在充满着复杂的阶级斗争的过渡时期，资产阶级思想还在各个方面侵蚀和影响着我们广大青年，各种反革命分子更是竭力用资产阶级的个人主义思想、资产阶级的唯心主义思想以及资产阶级的生活方式来毒害我们的青年。青年必须努力抵制和击退这一切侵蚀。资产阶级思想的危险性就在于它是同提高社会主义觉悟的要求正相对立的。沾染到资产阶级个人主义，就会弄到轻视劳动人民，脱离人民群众，把纯粹的自私自利当做天经地义。沾染到资产阶级唯心主义，就会弄到看不清楚社会发展规律，不能根据客观规律和广大人民的利益来判断正义和非正义，就会弄到对社会主义事业丧失信心。沾染到资产阶级的欺诈、懒惰、奢侈的生活方式，那就更不用说，只会走向腐化堕落的道路，而腐化堕落往往是走向反革命的开始。为了在广大青年中提高社会主义觉悟，我们必须对资产阶级思想和资产阶级的腐朽道德观念继续深入地展开斗争。
    有高度政治觉悟的人是不怕困难的。建设社会主义既然是一个极其伟大的事业，就一定有不少困难。革命总是从战胜困难中取得胜利的。艰苦奋斗是我们革命队伍的光荣传统。我们必须继承和发扬这个传统。革命前辈所经历的困难是雪山草地、流血牺牲，我们现时的困难同革命长辈们比起来，算得了什么呢？困难只能欺侮那些不能吃苦的人，困难害怕吃苦耐劳的战士。困难只能欺侮那些胆小鬼，困难害怕顽强进攻的英雄。困难只能欺侮那些懒汉，困难害怕用功学习的人。困难只能欺侮那些脱离群众的人，困难害怕团结一致的伟大集体。新中国的青年决不应该在困难面前低头，在困难面前退却，而要向困难斗争，把困难打倒。我们要自觉地承担最艰巨的工作，把自己锻炼成为坚强的社会主义、共产主义战士。
    青年团组织和它的成员的特殊责任
    大家知道，青年团不是一个什么随随便便的团体，青年团乃是中国青年的先进组织，是中国共产党的积极助手。既然青年团是这样性质的组织，就不是随便怎样的人都可以做青年团员。当一个青年团员，必须是党的政策的忠实执行者，必须是为社会主义而奋斗的坚决而积极的战士，必须是青年群众的朋友和模范。九月十八日，青年团中央委员会举行了第三次全体会议，一致通过了向全团提出将中国新民主主义青年团改名为中国共产主义青年团的建议。不难理解，把新民主主义青年团改名为共产主义青年团，决不是简单地改换一个名称，好像一个人把自己的名字从张三改为李四一样。把新民主主义青年团改名为共产主义青年团，是标志着青年团这个组织将更加坚定更加积极为社会主义和共产主义而奋斗到底，是意味着每一个团员都要更加努力把自己培养成为一个共产主义者。可以预料，全团同志和全国青年都会以战斗的姿态来迎接这个有历史意义的事情。
    现在，青年团有三十个省市团委，有三百四十五个省属市委和地委，有二千零七十一个县委和相当于县的团委，有六十二万多个基层组织，有一千四百万以上的团员。两年多来，我们绝大多数团的组织积极协助了党，动员全团并带动广大青年为社会主义而积极奋斗。我们的一千四百多万团员，绝大多数是站在青年群众的前列为社会主义而英勇奋斗的。我们的大会的成分就清楚地表明了这一点，出席这次大会的一千五百二十七个同志中，一千四百零八名都是青年团员，其中有九百二十三位同志已经光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    但是必须指出，在我们团的组织中还混进了一些反革命分子和其它的坏分子，他们虽然是极少数，但如果听任他们存在就会造成极大的危险。我们绝不能容许反革命分子隐藏在青年团的招牌下干反革命的勾当。我们必须把他们全部清查出来，彻底肃清。其他坏分子同样是青年团组织中的敌人，他们利用青年团的名义，违法乱纪，歪曲党的政策，毁坏团和青年群众的血肉联系。我们也必须坚决地把他们清洗出去。至于在我们团内还有一部分不合乎团员标准的思想意识落后的人对于他们必须加强教育。我们相信，这种同志大部分还是能教育好的，如果有个别教育不好的人，那只好请他退出团去。
    同志们可以看到，我们在迎接预定在明年下半年召开的青年团第三次全国代表大会的时期内，将要大力加强团的组织建设工作。我们相信，一切热爱社会主义的青年必定会帮助我们把一切混入团内的反革命分子和坏分子揭发出来，帮助我们教育那些不合乎团员标准的落后团员。我们相信，大批的为社会主义忠勇奋斗的积极青年将被吸收到团的队伍里来，他们将成为青年团组织的新鲜血液。
    向积极分子提出一点希望
    为了伟大而艰巨的社会主义事业，我们需要千千万万个积极分子。我们的党和毛主席希望我国有成千成万个积极分子、劳动英雄和模范工作者。在现在这个会上重新提出毛主席一九四五年在陕甘宁边区劳动英雄和模范工作者会议上所讲的话，我们以为是很适合的。在那一次讲话里，毛主席对劳动英雄和模范工作者作了极高的估价。他说：
    “你们开了会，总结了经验，大家欢迎你们，尊敬你们。你们有三种长处，起了三个作用。第一个，带头作用。这就是因为你们特别努力，有许多创造，你们的工作成了一般人的模范，提高了工作标准，引起了大家向你们学习。第二个，骨干作用。你们的大多数现在还不是干部，但是你们已经是群众中的骨干，群众中的核心，有了你们，工作就好推动了。到了将来，你们可能成为干部，你们现在是干部的后备军。第三个，桥梁作用。你们是上面的领导人员和下面的广大群众之间的桥梁，群众的意见经过你们传上来，上面的意见经过你们传下去。”
    毛主席紧接着又说：
    “你们有许多的长处，有很大的功劳，但是你们切记不可以骄傲。你们被大家尊敬，是应当的，但是也容易因此引起骄傲。如果你们骄傲起来，不虚心，不再努力，不尊重人家，不尊重干部，不尊重群众，你们就会当不成英雄和模范了。过去已有一些这样的人，希望你们不要学他们。”
    请同志们注意，毛主席就是这样向积极分子打招呼的。可惜我们的确有这样的青年，他们当了积极分子之后，便忘其所以，骄傲自满，不再努力。结果呢？结果是垮台了。
    我们一定要遵从毛主席的教导，老老实实、勤勤恳恳、生气勃勃地继续前进。
    亲爱的同志们！我们一定要永远前进。我们一定要永远做伟大祖国的忠实儿女！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    领导我国人民走向繁荣、富强、无限美好的社会主义和共产主义社会的伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！（附图片）
