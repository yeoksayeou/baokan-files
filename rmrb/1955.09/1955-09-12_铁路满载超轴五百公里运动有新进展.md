New Progress in the Railway Full-Load and Super-Axle 500 Kilometer Movement

    (Our dispatch) This year, railway workers across the country have further developed the full-load and super-axle 500 kilometer movement in their labor emulation. In the first half of the year, the entire railway system organized 84,482 super-axle trains, an increase of 204% compared to the same period last year, exceeding the axle weight by 18,420,000 tons, an increase of 133.8% compared to the same period last year. The ㄎ—833 contracted train group of the Jiamusi Locomotive Depot alone exceeded the axle weight 51 times in the first quarter, ensuring that all trains that could possibly exceed the axle weight did so on time. Many sections with previously difficult conditions for exceeding the axle weight are now able to do so regularly. The average gross traction weight of trains throughout the railway system reached 1,360.2 tons in the first half of the year, an increase of 25.3 tons compared to the same period last year. The daily car kilometers, technical speed, and travel speed of freight locomotives all exceeded planned targets. 24.2% of drivers throughout the railway system have become glorious 500-kilometer drivers. Transportation costs have decreased compared to the past. By transporting more goods through exceeding the axle weight alone, the country saved 13,618 trains. In the first half of the year, locomotives throughout the railway system saved 26,900 tons of coal, worth a total of 420,000 yuan.

    This year, the full-load and super-axle 500 kilometer movement has seen many new developments. Under the lead of advanced drivers Ma Yupu, Sun Shigui, Zhang Tingbao, Dong Zuogong, Yin Zhaokun, and advanced dispatchers Xu Kejun, Zhang Wanjun, Yin Guangfa, Zhang Yanqing and others in the Harbin Railway Bureau, a total of 11,325 non-stop runs through intermediate stations were organized by July 20th; railway bureaus in Jilin, Jinzhou, Tianjin, Jinan, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Liuzhou, and other places have successfully conducted key experiments and are gradually promoting this experience. In order to improve the organization of exceeding axle weight, many railway bureaus have established fixed super-axle and super-long operation lines this year, which have played a significant role in strengthening connections between sections, between sub-bureaus, and between the traffic and locomotive departments, reducing off-locomotive stops, and further organizing exceeding axle weight in a planned manner. The Meihekou and Shenyang sub-bureaus also organized cross-bureau super-axle movements. From April 11th to May 7th alone, they organized 59 super-axle trains, transporting an additional 7,900 tons with the same locomotives. Regarding full loading, due to a 15% increase in the number of large vehicles used compared to last year, many railway bureaus have formulated methods for mastering the use of large vehicles; the Harbin, Jilin, Jinzhou, Zhengzhou, and other railway bureaus have also promoted fixed-cycle operation methods for large vehicles. In the Jilin sub-bureau alone, each vehicle loaded an additional 3.5 tons in March and April. In addition, the Harbin Railway Bureau launched a boundary station competition in May, achieving significant results in strengthening the overall concept and improving transportation efficiency.

    Recently, based on the situation of the full-load and super-axle 500 kilometer movement in the first half of the year and the needs and possibilities for the second half of the year, the Ministry of Railways has made appropriate revisions to the tasks related to the full-load and super-axle 500 kilometers movement for the entire railway system this year. After the revision, the super-axle task for the second half of the year is 95,517 times, 21,570,000 tons. The Ministry of Railways recently issued instructions to further deepen the full-load and super-axle 500 kilometer movement, requiring all railway administrations to comprehensively and deeply organize the development of the movement and strive to complete and overfulfill the revised tasks.

    铁路满载超轴五百公里运动有新进展
    本报讯　今年全国铁路职工在劳动竞赛中，进一步开展了满载超轴五百公里运动。上半年，全路共组织了八万四千四百八十二次超轴列车，比去年同期增加百分之二百零四，超轴一千八百四十二万吨，比去年同期增加百分之一百三十三点八。仅佳木斯机务段冖ㄎ—八三三号包车组在第一季度就超轴五十一次，使一切可能超轴的列车都达到了超轴正点。许多超轴困难的区段也已经能经常超轴。全路列车平均牵引总重上半年达到一千三百六十点二吨，比去年同期提高了二十五点三吨。货物机车日车公里、技术速度和旅行速度，都超额完成计划。全路百分之二十四点二的司机，已经成为光荣的五百公里司机。运输成本比以前降低。仅因为超轴多运货物，就为国家节省了一万三千六百一十八个列车。上半年全路机车节省用煤二万六千九百吨，共值四十二万元。
    今年满载超轴五百公里运动有许多新的发展。哈尔滨铁路局在先进司机马玉谱、孙士贵、张廷宝、董作功、尹兆坤和先进调度人员徐克君、仉万俊、尹广发、张彦庆等人带头推行下，到七月二十日共组织了一万一千三百二十五次中间站不停车运行；吉林、锦州、天津、济南、上海、郑州、柳州等铁路局已经重点试验成功，正在逐步推广这一经验。为了改进超轴的组织工作，今年许多铁路局制定了固定超轴、超长运行线，对加强区段间，分局间以及车务和机务部门间的联系，减少机外停车，进一步有计划地组织超轴等方面起了很大作用。梅河口和沈阳分局间还组织了跨局的超轴运动，仅四月十一日到五月七日，便组织了五十九次超轴列车，用同样的机车，多运输了七千九百吨。在满载方面，由于大型车使用辆数比去年增加了百分之十五，许多铁路局制定了大型车掌握使用办法；哈尔滨、吉林、锦州、郑州等铁路局还推行了大型车固定循环运用办法，仅吉林分局在三四月份，每车就多装了三点五吨。此外，哈尔滨铁路局在五月份开展了分界站竞赛，在加强整体观念，提高运输效率等方面取得了显著的成效。
    最近，铁道部根据上半年满载超轴五百公里运动的情况和下半年的需要和可能，把今年全路有关满载超轴五百公里的任务作了适当修正。修正后，下半年的超轴任务是九万五千五百一十七次，二千一百五十七万吨。铁道部最近发出了进一步深入开展满载超轴五百公里运动的指示，要求各铁路管理局全面深入地组织运动的开展，争取完成和超额完成修正后的任务。
