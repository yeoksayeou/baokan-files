    Test
    Pan Fei
    If the Geneva spirit is a force for good, then those with the Geneva spirit should do new and beneficial things for mankind. In this sense, the Geneva spirit is indeed a test for people.
    Some people can withstand this test completely, while others are not so capable. They cannot bear the fiery heat of this hope that is increasing for hundreds of millions of people. They appear prickly and want to avoid the Geneva spirit, to quietly overturn it, and put the "Cold War" spirit in its place.
      The United Nations General Assembly is not a suitable occasion for doing such things, but the Australian representative, Casey, deliberately used this world forum to promote skepticism about the Geneva spirit. He doubted "whether the Geneva spirit is really what the world hopes for and prays for."
    After dismissing the Geneva spirit in this way, he put forward his so-called "test." He said that the Soviet Union "will agree to consider the reunification of Germany under what conditions, this is a serious test."
    Even if the German reunification issue is a "serious test," shouldn't Casey's friend Dulles be the one to undergo this test? Casey doesn't need to imitate Dulles, striking a pose of "I am the judge" to put a test to the Soviet Union. This kind of pose is only laughable, it's called a lack of self-awareness.
    The test of the German question is the test of the Geneva spirit. This account is easy to settle. The Soviet Union wants to bring the Germans of the two Germanys closer together so that they can solve their own problems and make German unification a peaceful and democratic country. This is the Geneva spirit. The United States opposes the Germans getting closer to each other, wants to annex East Germany into West Germany, and turn the whole of Germany into a large US military base in the center of Europe. This is not the Geneva spirit.
    The one being tested on this issue is precisely not the Soviet Union, but precisely the United States. Dulles understands this very well. So he didn't dare to strike his old pose at this United Nations General Assembly, to put some test to the Soviet Union. As a result, Casey was selected to carry the burden for Dulles.
    What is the use of carrying this burden? The Soviet Union has reduced its army by 640,000 troops, but the United States wants to maintain some kind of overwhelming advantage in air force atomic power. The Soviet Union has abolished its military bases in foreign countries, but the United States still wants to occupy more military bases in foreign countries. China wants to make the Sino-US talks go smoothly, but the United States takes up issues that have already been agreed upon to entangle them, preventing the talks from moving forward. The things the United States is doing itself give people the feeling that they are very stale, very old-fashioned "Cold War" tricks, and they don't feel a bit of the fresh Geneva spirit. Can this feeling be eliminated by Casey carrying the burden for others?
    If Casey really wants to help Dulles, then it is not to help him quietly overturn the Geneva spirit, but to remind him to face the test of the Geneva spirit and do something new and beneficial.

    如果说日内瓦精神是一种善意的力量，那末，有着日内瓦精神的人就应该会做出新鲜的、对人类有益的事情。在这个意义上，日内瓦精神确实是对人们的考验。
    这种考验有些人是完全受得住的，有些人就不那么行。他们禁不住这种增加亿万人民的希望的火红的热力，他们显得蝎蝎螫螫，想躲过日内瓦精神，想悄悄地把它推翻，把“冷战”精神放在它的位置上。
      联合国大会并不是做这种事的适当场合，可是，澳大利亚的代表凯西却有意用这个世界讲坛来提倡怀疑日内瓦精神。他怀疑“日内瓦精神是否真正是全世界所希望的和祈求的东西”。
    把日内瓦精神这样丢开了之后，他就提出了他的所谓“考验”。他说苏联“将以怎样的条件答应考虑德国的重新统一，这是严重的考验”。
    就算德国重新统一问题是一个“严重的考验”吧，难道凯西的朋友杜勒斯不正是应当受这个考验么？凯西很不用学着杜勒斯的模样，摆出“我是法官”的空架子来向苏联提考验。这种模样只能令人发笑，这叫做没有自知之明。
    德国问题的考验就是日内瓦精神的考验。这种账是容易算清楚的。苏联要使两个德国的德国人互相接近，以便他们自己能够解决自己的问题，使德国统一成为和平民主的国家。这就是日内瓦精神。美国反对德国人互相接近，要使西德并吞东德，把整个德国变成美国在欧洲中心的大兵站。这就不是日内瓦精神。
    在这个问题上受考验的恰恰不是苏联，恰恰就是美国。杜勒斯很明白这一点。所以他倒不敢在这次联合国大会上摆出他的老模样，要苏联受什么考验。结果，凯西就被选拔出来替杜勒斯扛木梢。
    扛这种木梢有什么用处呢？苏联裁减了六十四万军队，美国却要保持什么压倒优势的空军原子力量。苏联取消了在外国的军事基地，美国却还想在外国多占一些军事基地。中国要使中美会谈顺利进行，美国却把已经达成协议的问题拿来纠缠，使会谈不得前进。美国自己做的事情使人感到是十分陈腐、十分老一套的“冷战”把戏，觉不出一点新鲜的日内瓦精神。这种感觉难道是凯西替人扛木梢所能消除的吗？
    凯西如果真要帮杜勒斯的忙，那就不是帮他悄悄地把日内瓦精神推翻，而是提醒他好好面对日内瓦精神的考验，做点新鲜有益的事情。
