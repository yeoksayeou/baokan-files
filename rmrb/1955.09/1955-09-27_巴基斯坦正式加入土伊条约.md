Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 24th: A Karachi dispatch reports that Pakistan formally joined the Turkish-Iraqi military pact on September 23rd.

On that day, Pakistan's ambassador to Iraq, Agha Hilaly, deposited Pakistan's instrument of ratification for joining the treaty with the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, making Pakistan the fourth nation to join this military pact. The treaty was initially brokered by the United States and signed by Turkey and Iraq in February of this year in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. Subsequently, Britain also joined in April.

A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 23rd that after joining this military pact, Pakistan is obligated to cooperate with other member states to plan for the "development of a regional defense area." He also said that since Pakistan has now joined the Baghdad Pact, the military agreement signed between Pakistan and Turkey last April will be incorporated into the Baghdad Pact.

Iraqi Foreign Minister Burhaneddin Bashayan said on the same day that, as Pakistan has joined the Baghdad Pact, a ministerial council of the four nations—Turkey, Iraq, Britain, and Pakistan—will be established immediately in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.

    巴基斯坦正式加入土伊条约
    新华社新德里二十四日电　喀喇蚩消息：巴基斯坦已在九月二十三日正式加入土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。
    这一天，巴基斯坦驻伊拉克大使埃布·库里希把巴基斯坦参加这个条约的批准书交存伊拉克外交部，这就使巴基斯坦成为参加这个军事条约的第四个国家。这个条约首先是由美国撮合土耳其和伊拉克两国在今年二月在伊拉克首都巴格达签订的，其后英国也在四月间加入。
    巴基斯坦外交部发言人二十三日说，巴基斯坦加入这个军事条约后，有义务同其他成员国合作来策划一个“区域防御地区的发展”。他又说，由于巴基斯坦现在已经加入了巴格达条约，巴基斯坦和土耳其在去年四月签订的军事协定就将并入巴格达条约。
    伊拉克外交大臣巴沙扬同一天说，由于巴基斯坦参加了巴格达条约，将根据条约的规定马上成立土耳其、伊拉克、英国和巴基斯坦四国的部长级理事会。
