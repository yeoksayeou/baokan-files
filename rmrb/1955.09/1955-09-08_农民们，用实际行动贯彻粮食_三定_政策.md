Peasants, Use Practical Actions to Implement the "Three Fixes" Policy for Grain

Around this year's autumn harvest, the figures for "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain will be universally determined for each farm household. This is a further development of the grain unified purchase and sales work and is a great happy event for farmers across the country.

The unified purchase and sale of grain has been implemented for two years. These are two years of rapid advancement for the Chinese people on the road to socialism. Under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, Chinese farmers have actively increased production, actively participated in the collectivization movement, and sold surplus grain to the state, demonstrating their boundless love for the socialist cause.

The vivid facts of the past two years have made most farmers understand that implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain is beneficial and necessary for all the people of the country and for the vast number of farmers. However, following the state plan to arrange production and life is, after all, a new thing for farmers, and many people are not used to doing so. They feel that "it is better to have it yourself than to rely on parents," and want to keep as much grain as possible in their own hands. Many farmers are afraid that "unified purchase has no bottom line" and that they will have to sell more grain in the future.

It is not surprising that farmers both support the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and have some doubts about it. Farmers are laborers, they do not exploit others, and they are willing to build socialism together with the working class; individual farmers are also small private owners, they hope to maintain their freedom as small private owners as much as possible, while the unified purchase and sale of grain restricts the freedom of small private owners. In order to build socialism and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, the Party and the government have decided to take some necessary measures to form an agreement with the peasants; implementing the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain is an effective way to form an agreement with the peasants.

This spring, most areas implemented the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" work down to the township level. The preliminary grain yield per mu in each township has been determined, and the numbers for grain purchase and sales for the entire township have also been preliminarily determined. The concerns of many farmers who feared that "unified purchase has no bottom line" have been dispelled, and their enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved. However, some people are still not very relieved. Some say: The numbers for the township are fixed, but I still don't know my own situation. Some think: Although this is said, who knows if it will change? Some worry: If the production is fixed, what if we can't harvest that much grain? Now, these concerns can be eliminated. Many areas have already achieved a good summer harvest, and autumn crops in most areas are also expected to be abundant, facts that prove that the preliminary numbers for fixed production down to the township level before and after the spring plowing this year are not high. The "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Rural Grain" stipulates: For grain fields with a particularly bumper harvest in 1955, the normal annual yield will still be assessed according to the normal year's yield, and will not be calculated according to the actual yield of the particularly bumper harvest. These measures stipulate that the numbers for production, purchase, and sales should be fixed to each farm household: the production and purchase numbers remain unchanged for three years, and the sales numbers are evaluated annually; within three years, surplus grain households and self-sufficient households will not be required to sell more grain even if their actual yield exceeds the fixed yield. These measures also stipulate that for general farmers, only 80% to 90% of the surplus grain will be purchased, and not all of the surplus grain will be purchased; food rations, seeds, and feed should be retained according to the existing consumption level of farmers in various places, to ensure that farmers do not sell "excessive grain." At the same time, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, and grain-deficient households, and to find out the quantity and time of grain shortage for grain-deficient households, and ensure that they are supplied on time. After each unified purchase is completed, surplus grain households and self-sufficient households can freely dispose of the extra grain due to increased production and conservation: they can store it themselves, sell it to the state grain market and supply and marketing cooperatives, develop sideline production or other uses, and exchange goods among farm households. These regulations have satisfactorily answered the questions of many farmers and appropriately satisfied the requirements of many farmers.

The total amount of grain that the state purchases from farmers remains stable for three years, and the amount is also much less than last year. This shows that the state fully cares about the farmers. This year's planned national grain production is 360.8 billion catties, and the planned production for 1957 is 385.6 billion catties, an increase of 24.8 billion catties compared to this year. With increased production but no increase in purchase for three years, by 1957, the average farmer across the country will be able to keep about 50 catties more grain than this year, and each household will generally be able to keep about 200 catties more grain than this year. If the production plan is overfulfilled, even more can be retained.

Is it better to let farmers keep as much grain as possible? Wouldn't it be better to set the production lower and the sales lower? Wouldn't that be more beneficial to farmers with surplus grain? It is wrong to think this way. In order to compress the amount of grain sales, the Party and the government have made great efforts and have carried out the work of consolidating grain unified sales in both rural and urban areas. Now, the system of fixed quantity supply of grain has been implemented in towns and cities, and the amount of grain sales in towns and cities has been greatly reduced. To reduce it more significantly would not be able to meet the needs of workers and other people in towns and cities. The state stores some grain every year, so that it has the strength to cope with major famines and other unexpected events; it is very dangerous to let farmers keep more and not have state reserves. Farmers storing grain themselves in a decentralized manner is in any case not enough to cope with major unexpected events. Like the floods last year, in many areas, relying only on the farmers' own "accumulated grain" could not achieve the purpose of "preventing famine."

Does selling less grain than in the past mean that the needs of grain-deficient households cannot be met? Grain-deficient households need not worry. Selling less only means eliminating waste and correcting unreasonable phenomena, and it is by no means intended to reduce reasonable supply. The experience of consolidating grain unified sales during the spring and summer of this year has already proved that the past grain sales were too large, and many people who should not have been supplied with grain were able to buy grain. The experience of some places in trying out the "three fixes" to the household level has also proved that, as a result of simultaneously evaluating the purchase and sales numbers and clarifying the surplus and shortage, the amount of grain sales can be greatly reduced compared to last year.

Recently, some areas have implemented the method of "three fixes" to the household level. The broad masses of farmers warmly support this method. The working class and the people of the whole country thank the farmers for their active participation and strong support for the socialist construction cause in the past, and hope that the farmers will be more active in building socialism together with the working class in the future. What are the tasks of the farmers at present?

The first thing is to help the Party and the government do a good job in the "three fixes" work. This is not only a matter for the Party and the government, but also a matter for the farmers themselves. This matter cannot be done well without the active support of the broad masses of farmers. The standard for doing this well is: to ensure the needs of the state and take care of the interests of the farmers; to be conducive to industrial construction and also conducive to agricultural development; to promote the socialist cause and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. In order to achieve "both," it is necessary to set the production, purchase, and sales numbers accurately, fairly, and reasonably; to do this, farmers are required to tell the truth and help the Party and the government understand the real situation of grain production and consumption. The Party and the government will never ask to exaggerate the grain yield per mu and lower the farmers' existing normal grain consumption standards; farmers must never conceal the actual grain yield per mu, unreasonably raise grain consumption standards, over-report the number of people and livestock, and under-report the area of multiple cropping.

The second thing is to make every effort to expand agricultural and sideline production, while paying attention to conserving grain and opposing grain speculation. Surplus grain households should increase production even more, farmers with a large grain shortage should strive to reduce the grain shortage, farmers with a small grain shortage should strive to become self-sufficient, and farmers who can be self-sufficient should strive to have a surplus, so that in the future all grain-producing farmers will no longer ask the state to supply grain and will sell surplus grain to the state, which is a strong support for national construction. After these measures are taken, the grain supply for farmers in economic crop areas will be more reliably guaranteed, and the grain consumption standards can be guaranteed to be no lower than those of grain-producing farmers, and they should increase the production of more economic crops in accordance with the state plan. In the past, in some places with not much grain retained, farmers' pig and chicken and duck raising and sideline production were somewhat affected. In the future, with more grain retained, they should strive to develop these aspects of production. If it is thought that with more grain retained, one can not pay attention to conserving grain, can not appropriately store some grain, and waste or speculate with the grain, this is detrimental to the state and to oneself.

There is also a matter closely related to increasing production and improving living standards, which is the development of agricultural production cooperatives. After the "three fixes," there is even less need to fear that "entering the cooperative will expose one's bottom line to everyone," and there is even less need to fear that "entering the cooperative will require selling more grain." Facts have already proved that whoever joins the cooperative and actively works in the cooperative will improve their living standards faster. Agricultural production cooperatives increase production particularly significantly, and it is completely reasonable that they retain more grain than farmers outside the cooperative. It is glorious to be a surplus grain household, and it is even more glorious to be a hardworking member of an agricultural production cooperative. Whether surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, or grain-deficient households, joining agricultural production cooperatives is the best path. To increase production even more and better support national construction, one should join agricultural production cooperatives; to increase income even more and better improve one's own life, one should join agricultural production cooperatives.

### 农民们，用实际行动贯彻粮食“三定”政策

    农民们，用实际行动贯彻粮食“三定”政策
    今年秋收前后，粮食“定产、定购、定销”的数字就要普遍地规定到各个农户。这是粮食统购统销工作进一步的发展，是全国农民的一件大喜事。
    粮食统购统销已经实行两年了。这是我国人民在社会主义的道路上突飞猛进的两年。我国农民在工人阶级和共产党的领导下，积极增加生产，积极参加合作化运动和把余粮卖给国家，表现了对社会主义事业的无限热爱。
    两年来的生动的事实，使大部分农民已经了解，实行粮食统购统销对全国人民、对广大农民都是有利的，必要的。可是，按照国家计划安排生产和生活，对于农民说来，毕竟是一件新事情，许多人还不习惯这样做。他们觉得“爹有娘有不如自己有”，想在自己手里尽可能多留一些粮食。许多农民害怕“统购没有底”，怕以后要更多卖粮食。
    农民一方面拥护粮食统购统销政策，一方面对粮食统购统销政策又有一些疑虑，这并不是什么奇怪的事情。农民是劳动者，是不剥削别人的，是愿意同工人阶级一道建设社会主义的；个体农民又是小私有者，他们希望尽量保持自己小私有者的自由，而粮食的统购统销却是限制了小私有者的自由。为了建设社会主义，为了加强工农联盟，党和政府决定采取一些必要的办法同农民成立协定；实行粮食“定产、定购、定销”，就是同农民成立协定的一种有效的方法。
    今年春季，大部分地区把“定产、定购、定销”工作贯彻到了乡。每个乡的粮田产量初步定下来了，全乡购、销粮食的数字也初步定下来了。很多农民怕“统购无底”的顾虑已经解除，生产积极性大大提高了。但是，有些人仍然不大放心。有的说：乡里的数字是定了，我自己还是不摸底。有的想：虽然这样说了，谁知道还变不变？有的怕：产量定下了，打不下那么多粮食怎么办？现在，这些顾虑都可以消除了。许多地区已经得到很好的夏收，大部地区的秋庄稼又丰收在望，事实证明今年春耕前后初步定产到乡的数字是不高的。“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”规定：一九五五年特别丰收的粮田，常年产量仍按正常年景产量核定，并不要按特别丰收的实产量计算。这个办法规定把产、购、销的数字定到各个农户：产、购数字三年不变，销数每年评定；三年之内余粮户和自足户实产量超过定产量，也不多购。这个办法还规定对一般农民只买余粮的百分之八十到九十，并不收购全部的余粮；口粮、种籽、饲料要按各地农民现有消费水平留够，保证不使农民卖“过头粮”。同时，要确实划清余粮户、自足户、缺粮户，弄清楚缺粮户缺粮的数量和时间，对他们保证按时供应。每次统购结束以后，余粮户和自给户因增产节约多余的粮食，可以自由处理：自己储存，到国家粮食市场和供销社出卖，发展副业生产或者派别的用场，在农户间互通有无。这些规定，圆满地答复了许多农民的疑问，适当地满足了许多农民的要求。
    国家向农民购粮的总数稳定三年不变，数目也比上年度减少了很多。这说明了国家是充分地关心农民的。今年全国粮食计划产量是三千六百零八亿斤，一九五七年的计划产量是三千八百五十六亿斤，比今年可增加二百四十八亿斤。三年增产不增购，全国农民到一九五七年平均每人就可以比今年多留大约五十斤粮食，每户大致可以比今年多留二百多斤左右的粮食。如果超额完成生产计划，还可以留得更多。
    是不是让农民留的粮食越多越好呢？把产量定得更低些、销量定得更少些不好吗？这对余粮的农民不是更有利吗？这样想是不对的。为了压缩粮食销售量，党和政府已经作了很大的努力，在农村和城市都进行了整顿粮食统销工作。现在，市镇已经实行粮食定量供应制度，市镇粮食销售量已经大大减少了。再要更大量地减少，就不能满足工人和别的市镇人民的需要了。国家每年储存一些粮食，才能有应付大灾荒和其他意外事故的力量；为了让农民多留而不要国家储备，是十分危险的。农民自己分散地储存粮食，无论如何是不足以应付重大的意外事故的。像去年的水灾，在许多地区，只靠农民自己的“积谷”，就不能达到“防荒”的目的。
    比过去少销粮食，是不是不能满足缺粮户的需要呢？缺粮户可以不必担忧。少销只是取消浪费现象，纠正不合理的现象，绝不是要削减合理的供应。今年春夏之交整顿粮食统销的经验早已证明，过去的粮食销量是过大了，许多不该供应的人都买到了粮食。一些地方试行“三定”到户的经验也证明了，购销数字同时评定、划清余缺的结果，粮食销数比上年度可以大大减少。
    近来，部分地区已经实行了“三定”到户的办法。广大农民热烈拥护这个办法。工人阶级和全国人民感谢农民过去对社会主义建设事业的积极参加和大力支援，希望农民今后更积极地同工人阶级一起建设社会主义。当前农民的任务是什么呢？
    头一件事，就是要帮助党和政府做好“三定”工作。这不只是党和政府的事情，也是农民自己的事情。这件事情没有广大农民的积极支持是不可能做好的。做好这件事情的标准就是：既能保证国家需要，又能照顾农民利益；既要有利于工业建设，也要有利于农业发展；既能推进社会主义事业，又能巩固工农联盟。为了做到“两全其美”，就要把产、购、销数字定得准确、公平、合理；要做到这样，就要求农民一定说实话，帮助党和政府了解粮食生产和消费的真实情况。党和政府决不要求夸大粮田产量，降低农民现有的正常的用粮标准；农民也决不可隐瞒粮田的实产量，不合理地提高用粮标准，多报人口牲畜数字，少报复种面积。
    第二件事，就是尽一切努力扩大农业和副业生产，同时注意节约粮食，反对粮食投机。余粮户要更多地增加生产，缺粮多的农民要争取少缺粮，缺粮少的农民要争取自给，能自给的农民要争取有余，将来所有生产粮食的农民都不再要求国家供应粮食，并且把余粮卖给国家，这就是对国家建设的有力的支援。采取这些措施以后，经济作物区的农民的粮食供应有了更可靠的保证，而且用粮标准可以保证不低于生产粮食的农民，他们应该按照国家计划增产更多的经济作物。过去，在一些留粮不多的地方，农民养猪和鸡鸭、经营副业生产受到了一些影响，今后留粮多了，就应该努力发展这些方面的生产。如果认为留粮多了可以不注意节约粮食，可以不必适当地储存一些粮食，而把粮食浪费掉了或者进行投机，这都是对国家对自己不利的。
    还有一件同增加生产、改善生活有密切关系的事情，就是发展农业生产合作社。“三定”以后，更用不着害怕“入了社要被大家摸清自己的底”了，更用不着害怕“入了社要更多卖粮”了。事实已经证明，谁入了社而且在社里积极劳动，谁的生活就提高得更快。农业生产合作社增产特别多，留粮也就比社外农民多，这是完全合情合理的。做余粮户是光荣的，做勤劳的农业生产合作社社员就更光荣。不论余粮户、自足户和缺粮户，参加农业生产合作社都是最好的道路。要更多地增加生产，更好地支援国家建设，就应该参加农业生产合作社；要更多地增加收入，更好地改善自己的生活，就应该参加农业生产合作社。
