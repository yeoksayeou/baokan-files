Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 10th: According to Vietnam News Agency, on September 6th, Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army to the International Supervisory and Control Commission, wrote a letter to the International Commission, requesting the latter to intervene to stop the South Vietnamese authorities' retaliatory and terrorist actions against former resistance personnel.

The letter stated that from the day of the ceasefire to the present, violations of the Geneva Accords have become increasingly frequent and serious, including acts of terror, retaliation, and discrimination against former resistance personnel in the temporary and regroupment zones of the French Union forces, and repressive measures against people who support peace and national unification. According to incomplete figures, since the ceasefire, more than 5,400 people have been killed or injured, 705 people have gone missing, and 25,165 people have been arrested in the temporary and regroupment zones of the French Union forces as a result of the South Vietnamese authorities' terrorist and retaliatory actions. The International Commission has so far concluded that the French Union forces violated Article 14(c) of the agreement in seventeen cases.

The letter pointed out that since the end of 1954, under the guise of the "Denounce Communists Campaign," the South Vietnamese authorities have systematically and on a large scale carried out terrorist, retaliatory, and murderous actions against former resistance personnel. According to still incomplete figures, from the start of the so-called "Denounce Communists Campaign" in South Vietnam in November 1954 to the end of July 1955, 9,100 people have been arrested and imprisoned, 482 people have been killed, 194 people have gone missing, and 692 people have been injured.

The letter pointed out that while taking terrorist actions against former resistance personnel, the South Vietnamese authorities have been taking all possible measures to prevent the International Commission's mobile inspection teams from conducting investigations in South Vietnam, in an attempt to cover up their violations of the agreement.

The Liaison Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army requested the International Commission to intervene to stop the so-called "Denounce Communists Campaign," to dispatch mobile inspection teams to begin investigations, and to ensure that the French Union forces side guarantee to stop this retaliatory behavior against former resistance personnel and punish the criminals.

    越南人民军代表写信给国际委员会
    要求制止南越当局迫害前抗战人员的行为
    新华社河内讯　据越南通讯社十日讯：越南人民军总司令部驻国际监督和监察委员会联络代表团团长何文楼上校六日写信给国际委员会，要求后者出面干涉，以制止南越当局对前抗战人员采取的报复和恐怖行动。
    信中说，从停战日到现在为止，违反日内瓦协定的条款，对在法兰西联邦部队临时集结区和重新集结区内的前抗战人员采取恐怖、报复和歧视行动，以及对赞成和平和全国统一的人们采取镇压措施的事愈来愈频繁和严重了。根据不完全的数字，自从停战日起，在法兰西联邦部队临时集结区和重新集结区中，已经有五千四百多人被打死或打伤，有七百零五人失踪，有二万五千一百六十五人在南越当局采取的恐怖和报复行动中被捕。国际委员会迄今为止已经就十七个案件作出结论说，法兰西联邦部队违反了协定的第十四条丙款。
    信中指出，自从一九五四年年底以来，南越当局在“告发共产党运动”的招牌下，有计划地和大规模地对前抗战人员采取恐怖、报复和屠杀的行动。据仍然不完全的数字，南越在一九五四年十一月发动所谓“告发共产党运动”开始到一九五五年七月底，已经有九千一百人被逮捕和监禁，四百八十二人被杀害，一百九十四人失踪，六百九十二人受伤。
    信中指出，在对前抗战人员采取恐怖行动的同时，南越当局一直在采取一切可能的办法来阻止国际委员会机动视察小组在南越进行调查，企图掩盖他们的违反协定的行为。
    越南人民军联络代表团要求国际委员会出面干涉，以制止所谓“告发共产党运动”，派遣机动视察小组开始进行调查，使法兰西联邦部队方面保证停止对前抗战人员的这种报复行为，并惩办罪犯。
