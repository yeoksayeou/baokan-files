Title: Superstition in Violence Yields No Good Results

    The French government announced on September 13th that the Algerian Communist Party was illegal, and at the same time, it would dissolve other progressive and patriotic organizations in Algeria on the grounds that they were "directly related to the Algerian Communist Party." This is another vicious step taken by the French authorities to strengthen the suppression of the North African national liberation movement. It once again shows that the French authorities stubbornly want to rely on violent means to subdue the North African people's struggle against colonial rule, and are unwilling to truly recognize the legitimate demands of the North African people for national self-determination and independence.
    Since the French authorities launched a frenzied military attack on the people of Morocco and Algeria on August 20, it has aroused constant condemnation from world opinion. However, the French authorities have not repented. On the one hand, they have tried to use methods such as "reform" and "negotiation" to ease the resistance of the people of Algeria and Morocco, and on the other hand, they have intensified their suppression in North Africa. Arrests and massacres continue, and bloodshed is increasing. According to estimates by Western news agencies, from August 20 to September 1, nearly 4,000 people were killed in North Africa. In order to strengthen its military suppression forces, the French authorities have continued to send reinforcements, increasing the number of French troops stationed in North Africa to more than 200,000. At the same time, the French authorities have also carried out large-scale searches and arrests of North African people in various parts of France, and are now carrying out illegal persecution of legal political parties and patriotic organizations in Algeria. All these practices of the French authorities can only further aggravate the already very tense situation in North Africa. All people who uphold justice and care about international peace cannot but express their opposition and protest against this.
    The reason why the French authorities want to declare the Algerian Communist Party illegal is because the Algerian Communist Party is the strongest leading force in the Algerian national liberation movement. The banner it holds high against the colonial system has united the broad masses of patriotic people in Algeria to fight for national independence. The Algerian Communist Party relentlessly exposed the French colonial authorities' attempt to use the so-called "reform plan" to divide the Algerian national movement, and demanded that France negotiate with the true representatives of the Algerian people on the basis of recognizing the national aspirations of the Algerian people, so that the Algerian issue can be resolved rationally. The Algerian Communist Party's recent statement clearly pointed out that: the "solution to the Algerian problem cannot be assimilation rejected by the Algerian people, nor can it be 'merger' in another form, but respect for our national character, the establishment of a democratic republic, and the maintenance of a freely agreed relationship of union with France on the basis of equality and mutual respect for existing interests." This is the common desire and proposition of the vast majority of the Algerian people, which cannot be changed or shaken by any violent means or conspiracies. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people against colonial rule is clear evidence of this. The French colonialists' attempt to dissolve the Algerian Communist Party to deprive the Algerian people's national liberation movement of its leadership, thereby destroying their will to strive for national independence, is completely futile. On the contrary, the French colonialists' perverse actions can only prompt the patriotic people of Algeria to recognize the true face of the French colonialists more clearly and unite more closely to persist in their just struggle.
    Now is the time for the French authorities to realize that the policy of violence is doomed to bankruptcy. The French government has put itself in an unprecedentedly isolated position because of its bloody actions in North Africa. All progressive mankind stands on the side of the North African people. Respecting the North African people's desire for independence and self-determination is not only the demand of more than 20 million North African people, but also the demand of hundreds of millions of just people around the world. The statement issued by the Asian-African Group of the United Nations is correct: "Morocco and Algeria can only serve the cause of freedom and justice as free and independent countries, not as enslaved countries. Their continued subordinate status can only cause increasingly serious disturbances and riots, and cause tragic destruction of international peace." If the French government remains obsessed with its mistakes and continues to act perversely, it will inevitably suffer the consequences of its own actions.

    迷信暴力不会有好结果
    法国政府九月十三日宣布阿尔及利亚共产党为非法，同时要以“和阿尔及利亚共产党有直接联系”的名义解散阿尔及利亚其他的进步、爱国组织。这是法国当局加强镇压北非民族解放运动的又一凶恶步骤，它再一次表明法国当局硬想依靠暴力手段压服北非人民反对殖民统治的斗争，而不愿真正承认北非人民民族自决和独立的合法要求。
    自从法国当局于八月二十日向摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚人民发动疯狂的军事进攻以后，就激起了世界舆论不断的谴责。但是法国当局却不知悔祸，一面企图用“改革”和“谈判”等手法来和缓阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民的反抗，一面又加紧在北非的镇压行动。逮捕和屠杀继续进行，流血事件有增无已。据西方通讯社的估计，自八月二十日至九月一日，在北非被杀害者几达四千人。为了增强它的军事镇压力量，法国当局不断加派援军，使法国在北非的驻军增加到了二十万人以上。同时法国当局还在法国各地大举搜捕北非人民，现在又对阿尔及利亚的合法政党和爱国组织进行非法迫害。法国当局所有这些做法，只能使已然十分紧张的北非局势更加恶化。一切主张正义和关怀国际和平的人们都不能不对此表示反对和抗议。
    法国当局所以要宣布阿尔及利亚共产党为非法，是因为阿尔及利亚共产党是阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的最坚强的领导力量，它所高举的反对殖民制度的旗帜，团结了阿尔及利亚广大的爱国人民为争取民族独立而斗争。阿尔及利亚共产党无情地揭破法国殖民当局企图用所谓“改革计划”来分化阿尔及利亚民族运动的阴谋，要求法国在承认阿尔及利亚人民民族愿望的基础上和阿尔及利亚人民的真正代表进行谈判，使阿尔及利亚问题获得合理的解决。阿尔及利亚共产党最近发表的声明，明确指出：阿尔及利亚问题的“解决办法不能是阿尔及利亚人民所拒绝的同化，不能是换一种说法出现的‘合并’，而是尊重我国的民族个性，建立一个民主共和国，在平等而相互尊重现存利益的基础上同法国保持自由同意的联合的关系。”这是阿尔及利亚绝大多数人民的共同愿望和主张，决非任何暴力手段或者阴谋诡计所能改变和动摇的。阿尔及利亚人正在进行的反抗殖民统治的英勇斗争就是明证。法国殖民主义者企图以解散阿尔及利亚共产党的措施使阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动失去领导，从而摧毁他们争取民族独立的意志，这完全是徒然的。恰恰相反，法国殖民者这种倒行逆施的作法，只能促使阿尔及利亚的爱国人民更加认清法国殖民者的真面目，加倍团结地坚持他们的正义斗争。
    现在应该是法国当局认识到暴力政策注定要破产的时候了。法国政府由于它在北非的血腥行径已使自己处于空前孤立的地位，一切进步人类都站在北非人民的一边。尊重北非人民独立和自决的愿望，不仅是两千多万北非人民的要求，也是全世界亿万正义人民的要求。联合国亚非集团发表的声明说得对：“摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚只有作为自由和独立的国家，而不是作为受奴役的国家才能服务于自由和正义的事业。它们继续处于附属的地位，只能引起日益严重的骚扰和暴动，并且引起国际和平的悲惨的破坏。”如果法国政府依然执迷不悟，继续倒行逆施，必将自食其恶果。
