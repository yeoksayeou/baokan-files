    南“科罗”歌舞团举行首次表演会
    新华社三十一日讯　南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团三十一日晚在北京天桥剧场举行首次歌舞表演会。歌舞团演出的具有鲜明的民族色彩的歌舞节目，受到北京观众们的热烈欢迎，有的节目谢幕八次，并重演了两次。
    表演开始前举行了演出开幕式，穿着鲜艳的民族服装的歌舞团人员由文化部副部长夏衍陪同出现在舞台上，这时，全场观众以经久不息的热烈掌声来欢迎他们。
    夏衍向歌舞团致欢迎词说：中南两国人民都要求和平，我们都要建设社会主义的幸福生活。我们曾在战斗中相互鼓舞，我们更要在建设中相互支持。南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团在中国的演出，无疑地将会加强我们两国之间的相互了解、相互尊重、相互学习。夏衍感谢歌舞团带来了南斯拉夫人民对中国人民的兄弟般的友谊，并且预祝歌舞团演出成功。
    歌舞团团长斯科夫兰在致词时，对歌舞团有机会为中国人民演出南斯拉夫的民间音乐和歌舞表示感到荣幸，并且感谢对歌舞团的热情招待和欢迎。斯科夫兰说：我们知道中国人民的这些热情和友好的表示都是通过我们向南斯拉夫人民致意的，这就说明为什么我们对它更加珍视，也说明为什么我们以更为珍惜和尊敬的心情来接受它。
    讲话结束后，中国的女青年文艺工作者向斯科夫兰献花。
    歌舞团在今天的晚会上演出了十七个精彩的舞蹈节目和两个民间音乐节目。歌舞团表演的舞蹈具有强烈的民族特点和纯朴的民间气息，有的舞蹈表现了南斯拉夫人民英雄不屈的斗争性格和南斯拉夫人民坚毅、热情、幽默的性格。这些南斯拉夫各民族的舞蹈在形式上是多样化，其中有由民间乐队和合唱伴奏的舞蹈，也有完全没有伴奏伴唱的哑舞。
    由两位男女舞蹈家合演的“莎达舞”是一个抒情的舞蹈。年青的姑娘在舞蹈中向她的情人显示她能从事一切家务的，舞蹈进行中洋溢着欢快和幽默的气氛。在观众长时间鼓掌后，这个舞蹈又重演了一次。
    观众热烈欢迎表现南斯拉夫人民英雄气概的“格米特舞”。这个舞蹈是描写南斯拉夫反抗土耳其争取祖国解放的战争的，舞蹈者伴着鼓声跳舞，表现了人民游击队的斗争和生活片断。表演者八次谢幕，并且两次重演了这个舞蹈中的一段。
    在演出结束后，国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅，秘书长习仲勋，文化部代理部长钱俊瑞、副部长夏衍，外交部副部长姬鹏飞曾到后台祝贺南斯拉夫艺术家们演出成功，并在一起合影留念。（附图片）
