At the eighth day of the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress—the afternoon of the 27th, Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke to the more than one thousand male and female youth activists attending the meeting. Deng Yingchao said: Women are an important and indispensable force in socialist construction. In recent years, Chinese women, especially young women, have demonstrated the characteristics of diligence, courage, enthusiasm, and ingenuity on all fronts, and have made outstanding contributions to the motherland. Deng Yingchao pointed out that youth activists should play a leading role among young people, especially in mobilizing young women, and should earnestly implement the policy of equality between men and women, and treat women with communist ideological principles. She encouraged young women to strive for progress, to be self-reliant, and to make themselves strong and resolute fighters in the cause of socialist construction.
    Cosmodemyanskaya, the mother of Soviet youth heroine Zoya and a member of the Soviet cultural delegation visiting China, attended the congress today. As soon as she entered the venue, the youth activists, who were taking a break, surrounded her and warmly welcomed the mother of the hero. The glorious image of her daughter Zoya constantly educates Chinese youth. Her book "The Story of Zoya and Shura" has sold more than 1.3 million copies in China. Cosmodemyanskaya introduced Zoya's childhood life and her heroic deeds of dedicating her youth and life to defend the motherland to the youth activists at the meeting today. Her speech once again deeply moved the youth activists attending the meeting. To express their love and respect for the heroic mother, representatives of the youth activists presented her with bouquets of flowers and presented her with seven Chinese translations of "The Story of Zoya and Shura" on behalf of the congress.
    One hundred Young Pioneers representing the Young Pioneers of Beijing Municipality came to congratulate the congress on the 27th, beating drums. They expressed their hope to grow up quickly and, in two or three five-year plans, build a great motherland like the older brothers and sisters attending the meeting.
    At the meeting on the 27th, the enthusiasm of youth activists for the national labor competition to increase production and practice economy was even higher. Sixteen youth activists from the industrial and transportation fronts in Beijing, seventeen young tractor drivers from units such as the State-run Friendship Farm, four young activists from the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army who built the Yingxia Railway, and young activists from animal husbandry in Xinjiang all proposed initiatives, competition conditions, or guarantees to overfulfill the national plan and increase production and practice economy. Youth activists working in commerce, medicine and health, and rural areas also submitted thirty-three written proposals and guarantees to the presidium of the congress.
    The speeches at the congress concluded on the 27th. From the 21st to the 27th, a total of one hundred and twenty-eight youth activists from various fronts spoke at the congress. Their exemplary deeds are encouraging the youth of the country to advance towards great socialism. (Xinhua News Agency)
