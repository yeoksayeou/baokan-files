    Most Agricultural Cooperatives in Guangdong Province Increase Production

    The summer harvest in Guangdong Province has concluded, and the majority of the province's over 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives have achieved increased production. In all areas with increased production, agricultural production cooperatives saw the largest gains. For example, the Fengshou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chao'an County achieved an average early rice yield of 655 jin per mu this year, an increase of over 40% compared to last year, and 120 jin more per mu than local mutual aid teams. The Zhuzai Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xuwen County achieved an average yield of 644 jin per mu, equivalent to three times the yield of farmers outside the cooperative. In some areas where production was severely reduced due to disasters, the harvests of cooperatives were also higher than those of farmers outside the cooperatives. The Daxi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hua County, although suffering from severe waterlogging, drought, and insect pests this year, saw an 18% decrease in early rice production compared to last year. However, the 370 mu of paddy fields of farmers outside the cooperative in the same village are estimated to have an average yield reduction of over 50% per mu. Therefore, many agricultural production cooperatives have become banners in rural areas for overcoming disasters and ensuring increased production, encouraging the broad masses of farmers to take the path of collectivization.

    广东省农业合作社大部增产
    广东省夏收已经结束，全省一万五千多个农业生产合作社，大部分都获得了增产。在所有增产的地区，农业生产合作社增产最多；如潮安县丰收农业生产合作社，今年早稻平均每亩产量六百五十五斤，比去年增产百分之四十以上，比当地的互助组每亩多收一百二十斤。徐闻县竹仔村农业生产合作社，平均每亩产量六百四十四斤，相当于社外农民产量的三倍。在部分因灾重减产的地区，合作社的收成也高于社外农民。花县大溪农业生产合作社，今年虽因严重的水、旱、虫等灾害的袭击，早稻比去年减产了百分之十八。但同村社外农民的三百七十亩水田，估计每亩平均却要减产五成以上。因此许多农业生产合作社都已成为农村中战胜灾害、保证增产的旗帜，鼓舞着广大农民走合作化的道路。
