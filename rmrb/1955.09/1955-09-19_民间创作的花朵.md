Flowers of Folk Creation
Vietnamese Writer Chen Youchun

The song "The Harvest is Ripe" and the folk dance "Bamboo Grove Merry Dance" occupy a special place among the Vietnamese people's favorite literary and artistic works. They are full of the breath of life, the desire for the peaceful unification of the motherland, and the sincere love for the motherland. These simple folk creations have profound significance.

The song "The Harvest is Ripe" blossoms like a fresh flower from the mouths of the male and female guerrillas in the Dong Thap Muoi Plain of South Vietnam. The song goes:

	The golden harvest is ripe.
	To harvest it in time,
	We gather together and pick up our sickles...

The song reflects the struggle to win every ear of grain, every kernel. Farmers sing it in the moonlit fields, guerrillas sing it on guard in their hometown villages—it is sung in every corner of our land.

The Vietnamese people are filled with deep patriotic sentiments, and this feeling is intertwined in the song with loyalty and love for Uncle Ho—President Ho Chi Minh:

	Thank you, Uncle Ho,
	You lead us in the struggle,
	The farmers have obtained land,
	They labor and live prosperously!

An armistice has been achieved on Vietnamese soil. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is earnestly implementing the Geneva Accords. Now, the song "The Harvest is Ripe" reflects a new mood—the determination to fight for peace, for the country's unification, independence, and democracy.

On that historic day in January 1955, when the Vietnamese people welcomed Uncle Ho back to the capital Hanoi, they sang this song while reviewing the troops. Songs and dances of struggle and victory, created throughout the country, resonated throughout the city.

Among them was the "Bamboo Grove Merry Dance," a dance performed with bamboo poles. Bamboo occupies an important place in the lives of the Vietnamese people: it has long been used as a building material, for making agricultural tools, and so on. This dance originated in northwestern Vietnam. Since ancient times, residents of this area have performed it during New Year's festivals.

No one learned this dance in school; it has been passed down from generation to generation. Once, when our soldiers performed this dance, an old peasant woman said, "In the past, I had to dance this for the landlord. My body was dancing, but my heart was filled with resentment. Now that we have won, our dance is once again freely enjoyed by all of us—our entire people. Dance, my children, let the light come, let the sun rise from behind the mountains."

It is this sun that is shining on the cities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and many art troupes are bringing their songs and dances to Hanoi. The festive celebrations did not stop at night, taking place around Hoan Kiem Lake and the Turtle Tower in the center of the lake, illuminated by colored lights.

Many wartime songs and dances have become the songs and dances of the entire people in the days of peaceful construction and the struggle for peace. These songs and dances are often performed when summing up the achievements of competitions in restoring industry and building railway bridges and when carrying out land reform.

The song about the harvest was born in the south, in the war zone of Dong Thap Muoi, while the Bamboo Grove Dance was born in the north, among the residents of northwestern Vietnam. The two met in the beloved capital Hanoi and from there spread to every corner of the country, and then, via Beijing and Moscow, reached Warsaw.

However, it was not only these two small flowers of Vietnam that were performed in Warsaw. Many of our other folk songs were also performed there. "Quan Ho" is an ancient song from Bac Ninh province that describes people's close friendship. The labor song "Hue Rowing Song" is sung by rowers on the river, narrating the people's patriotic feelings, and there are other songs as well.

Participants in the Youth Festival saw the dance "Happy Production Dance," which expresses the feelings of farmers who obtained land after land reform.

The true flowers of folk creation, the songs and dances we created in difficult times, are now blossoming in peaceful days. Therefore, they made such a joyful sound at the festival of youth around the world in Warsaw.

This year, whether in the distant south or on the construction sites of the northern Vietnamese railway, whether under the green shade of coconut trees or on bridges rebuilt over rushing rivers, words filled with love are resounding:

	The most beautiful flower—is the lotus,
	The most beautiful name in Vietnam—is the name of Uncle Ho!

### 民间创作的花朵

    民间创作的花朵
    越南作家　陈友椿
    歌曲“庄稼熟了”和民间舞蹈“竹丛联欢舞”在越南人民所喜爱的文艺作品中占着特殊的地位。它们充满了生活的气息、对于祖国的和平统一的渴望，充满了对祖国的真诚热爱。这些民间创作的朴实的作品有着深刻的意义。
    歌曲“庄稼熟了”在南越同塔梅平原的男女游击队员的口中，像一朵鲜花一样地盛开着。歌里唱道：
    金黄色的庄稼熟了。
    为了及时收割它，
    我们聚在一起，拿起镰刀……
    歌曲反映了争取每一个谷穗、每一颗谷粒的斗争。农民在月光照耀下的田野上唱着它，在故乡农村中站岗的游击队员唱着它——在我们土地的各个角落都唱着它。
    越南人民心中充满着深刻的爱国主义情感，这种感情在歌曲中交织着对胡伯伯——胡志明主席的矢忠和热爱：
    感谢你，胡伯伯，
    在斗争中你领导着我们，
    农民获得了土地，
    他们劳动着，富裕地生活着！
    在越南的土地上实现了停战。越南民主共和国正在认真地执行着日内瓦协定。现在，歌曲“庄稼熟了”反映着新的情绪——为争取和平、争取国家的统一、独立和民主而斗争的决心。
    在一九五五年一月的具有历史意义的那一天，越南人民欢迎胡伯伯回到首都河内，在检阅军队的时候唱起了这首歌曲。国内各地创作的、斗争和胜利的歌曲和舞蹈响彻了整个城市。
    其中也有“竹丛联欢舞”，它是一种手拿着竹杆的舞蹈。竹子在越南人民的生活中占有重要的地位：老早就已用它作建筑材料，用它制造农具等等。这个舞蹈的诞生地在越南西北部。自古以来，这个地区的居民就在新年节日中表演它。
    谁也没有在学校里学过这个舞蹈，它是一代代相传下来的。有一次，当我们的战士跳起这个舞来时，一位老农妇说道：“从前我必须为地主跳这个舞。我的身子跳着，可是心里充满着愤恨。现在，当我们已经胜利，我们的舞蹈也重新被我们大家——我们全体人民自由享受了。跳吧，我的孩子们，要让光明来到，让太阳从山后升起来。”
    就是这个太阳正在照耀着越南民主共和国的城市，许许多多的艺术团体把自己的歌舞带到河内来。节日的欢庆在夜里也没有停息，它在还剑湖边和湖中心龟塔周围的彩色灯光照耀下进行着。
    战争时期的许多歌舞，在和平建设和争取和平斗争的日子里成为全体人民的歌舞了。在总结恢复工业和建筑铁路桥梁的竞赛成绩时，当进行土地改革时，这些歌舞都常常演出。
    关于收获的那支歌曲，是诞生在南方、在战争地区同塔梅的，而竹丛舞则是诞生在北方、越南西北部的居民中间的。两者在亲爱的首都河内相遇，并且由此传到全国各个角落，又经过北京和莫斯科而到达华沙。
    但是，在华沙演出的不仅越南的这两个小小的花朵。我们的许多其他民歌也在那儿演出了。“官贺”是北宁省的一首古老的歌，它描述人们的亲密的友谊。劳动的歌曲“顺化划船曲”是河上划船人的歌，叙述人民的爱国主义感情，还有其他的歌。
    青年联欢节的参加者们看到了舞蹈“生产欢乐舞”，这是表现土地改革后获得了土地的农民的感情的。
    民间创作的真正花朵，我们在困难时期创作的歌舞，现在，在和平的日子里盛开了。因此，它们在华沙全世界青年的节日上发出了这样愉快的声音。
    今年无论在遥远的南部，或是在越南北部铁路的建筑工地，无论在椰子树的绿荫下还是在奔腾的河流上重新建起的桥上，都响着充满了热爱的词句：
    最美丽的花儿——是莲花，
    越南最美丽的名字——是胡伯伯的名字！
          （译自九月一日“苏维埃文化报”）
