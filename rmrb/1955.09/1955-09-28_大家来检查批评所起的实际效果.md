Let's All Examine the Actual Effects of Criticism

Recently, we conducted a review of the actual effects of some of the critical letters published in the past in the "Reader's Letters" section. The five letters published today are part of the results of that review. From these letters, it can be seen that, driven by mass criticism, many units have begun to correct shortcomings and improve their work, and some have even achieved preliminary results; for the problems that still exist, they are also actively taking measures to solve them. This attitude towards criticism is correct.

Checking the actual effects of criticism is of great significance to ensuring the smooth development of criticism and self-criticism in newspapers. Publicly exposing the shortcomings and errors in our work in the newspaper is aimed at eliminating these shortcomings and errors, improving our work, and doing a good job in the country's construction. Countless facts have proved that the masses' criticism published in newspapers is indeed a huge driving force for improving work. However, there are also some agencies and units that cannot adopt a correct attitude towards criticism. As reader Guan Qiuxi revealed in the "Reader's Letters" section on July 17th, since February of this year, newspapers and periodicals such as the Heilongjiang Daily and Heavy Industry Communications have made eleven criticisms of the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Metal Structure Engineering Company of the Bureau of Building Materials Industry of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, but this company ignored some of these criticisms; some just gave the newspaper a perfunctory "inspection report," but in reality, they did not seriously examine and improve their work. This situation shows that after our newspapers publish readers' criticisms, they cannot simply be satisfied with the criticized's response indicating acceptance of the criticism, but must also check whether the criticized has actually improved their work. Only in this way can we effectively fight against the bureaucratic attitude towards criticism and ensure that every published critical letter achieves its due effect.

The work of checking the effects of criticism will further consolidate the ties between the Party and the people, enhance the people's awareness and enthusiasm, and attract the people to pay more attention to the country's construction. Our experience has proved that many readers have greatly improved their political awareness and sense of responsibility for national construction because the criticism they published in the newspaper has had a practical effect in promoting and improving work, and they are more courageous and active in fighting against all phenomena that are detrimental to the cause of national construction. Therefore, newspapers regularly checking the effects of criticism and selecting important ones for public publication is a practical education for the broad masses.

The work of newspapers checking the effects of criticism cannot be done well without the participation of the broad masses. We hope that the broad masses of readers will actively support and vigorously assist in the work of checking the actual effects of the criticisms published in the "Reader's Letters" section, pay close attention to this aspect and promptly report to us. Let us work together to make criticism and self-criticism in newspapers more extensive and healthy, expose and eliminate various undesirable phenomena that harm national construction and the interests of the people, and ensure the smooth progress of the great cause of socialist construction in the country!

    大家来检查批评所起的实际效果
    最近，我们对过去“读者来信专页”中发表的一部分批评信件所起的实际效果，进行了一次检查。今天发表的五件来信，就是检查结果中的一部分。从这些来信中可以看到，在群众批评的推动下，很多单位已经开始纠正缺点，改进工作，有的并且取得了初步的成绩；对于目前仍然存在的问题，也正在积极采取措施加以解决。这种对待批评的态度是正确的。
    检查批评所起的实际效果，这项工作对保证报纸上批评和自我批评的顺利开展有着重大的意义。在报纸上公开揭露我们工作中的缺点和错误，其目的就是为了消除这些缺点和错误，改进我们的工作，做好国家的建设事业。无数事实证明了，报纸上发表的群众的批评，的确是改进工作的巨大推动力量。但是，也还有一些机关单位对待批评不能采取正确的态度。像七月十七日“读者来信专页”中读者管秋喜就揭露过这样的事实：今年二月以来黑龙江日报、重工业通讯等报刊对重工业部建筑材料工业管理局金属结构工程公司工作中的缺点和错误先后提出了十一次批评，但是这个公司对这些批评有的置之不理；有的就给报社一个敷衍塞责的“检查报告”，而实际上并没有认真地检查和改进工作。这种情况说明，我们的报纸在发表了读者的批评信后，不能仅仅满足于被批评者答复中关于接受批评的表示，还必须检查被批评者是否切实改进了工作。只有这样，才能够有力地同对待批评的官僚主义态度进行斗争，才能够保证每一件发表的批评信件得到应有的效果。
    检查批评效果的工作，还会进一步巩固党和人民群众的联系，提高人民群众的觉悟性和积极性，吸引人民群众更加关心国家建设事业。我们的经验证明了：很多读者由于他在报纸上所发表的批评起了推动和改进工作的实际效果，因而大大地提高了政治觉悟和对国家建设的责任感，更加勇敢和积极地同一切不利于国家建设事业的现象进行斗争。因而，报纸经常检查批评效果并选择其中重要的公开发表，对广大群众是一个实际的教育。
    报纸检查批评效果的工作，如果不吸收广大群众参加，是不可能做好的。我们希望广大读者对检查“读者来信专页”发表的批评所起实际效果的工作，给以积极的支持和有力的协助，经常注意这方面的情况并且及时向我们反映。让我们共同努力，使报纸上的批评和自我批评更加广泛和健康地展开，揭发并消除各种危害国家建设和人民利益的不良现象，保证国家社会主义建设的伟大事业顺利地进行！
