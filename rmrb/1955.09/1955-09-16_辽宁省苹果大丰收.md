In the Bumper Harvest Season

    Liaoning Province Achieves a Bumper Apple Harvest
    The peak season for harvesting apples in Liaoning Province has now begun. In the main producing areas of the Liaodong Peninsula, Gaiping and Fuxian counties, over two million jin of apples are being put on the market every day. According to a recent general survey by the Liaoning Provincial Planning Committee in coordination with relevant departments, the total apple production in Liaoning Province this year may reach 316 million jin, an increase of more than 51 million jin compared to 1954, the year with the highest production since liberation. In 1950, the total apple production in the province was only over 99 million jin.
    Farmers in the fruit-growing areas improved their cultivation techniques and pest and disease control work this year. Apple trees in Gaiping County were generally given increased base fertilizer and reasonable fruit thinning. Most of the apple trees in the fruit production cooperatives have been sprayed eight times, basically overcoming the damage caused by codling moths and red spiders. It is estimated that the total apple production in the county will exceed the original plan by 16 percent. The quality has also been greatly improved compared to previous years, with high-quality apples meeting export standards accounting for a quarter of the total production in the county.
    This year, the National Food Company will purchase 25 percent more apples in Liaoning Province than last year. Apple exports will increase by more than 30 percent compared to last year, and their value can earn the country more than 31,000 tons of steel. (Xinhua News Agency)

    辽宁省苹果大丰收
    现在辽宁省收摘苹果的旺季已经开始。主要产地辽东半岛盖平、复县两地每天上市的苹果都在二百万斤以上。据辽宁省计划委员会协同有关部门最近的普查估计：今年辽宁省苹果的总产量可以达到三亿一千六百万斤，比解放后产量最高的一九五四年增产五千一百多万斤。一九五零年全省苹果产量只有九千九百多万斤。
    果树区农民今年改进了栽培技术和防治病虫害等工作。盖平县的苹果树普遍做到增施基肥和合理稀果。大部分果树生产合作社的苹果树都打过八次药水，基本上战胜了食心虫和红蜘蛛等为害。预计全县苹果的总产量可超过原订计划百分之十六。质量也比往年大为提高，全县合乎出口规格的上等苹果可占总产量的四分之一。
    今年国家食品公司在辽宁省收购的苹果将比去年增加百分之二十五。出口的苹果将比去年增加百分之三十以上，它的价值可为国家换回钢材三万一千多吨。　（新华社）
