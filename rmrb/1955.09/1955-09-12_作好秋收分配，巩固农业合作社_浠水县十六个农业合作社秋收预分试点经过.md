To gain experience in autumn harvest distribution and correctly guide the distribution work of agricultural cooperatives throughout the county, the Xishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province sent people to conduct pre-distribution pilot work in sixteen cooperatives in Wangcheng Township. The sixteen cooperatives had the following three production situations: (1) Individual cooperatives experienced reduced summer harvest yields, leading to food shortages for some households and low enthusiasm among members. (2) Some cooperatives were threatened by drought in the previous period, and members lacked confidence in achieving a good harvest, believing that "Grain is still in the sky; it only counts when the grain is harvested in the basket!" (3) Cooperatives with better production had a sense of complacency, thinking, "The harvest is in hand; we're just waiting to take the sickle and cut the grain." Generally speaking, the enthusiasm for production was not high.

The members of each cooperative had both concerns and demands regarding pre-distribution. The main concerns were: (1) Concerns about the "three fixings" of grain, fearing that the estimated output would be too high and they would have to sell more surplus grain. Some members of the cooperatives even believed that pre-distribution was a probe into the bottom line for unified purchase. (2) Fear that the cooperative cadres would not correctly implement the pre-distribution policy, fearing that excessive deductions for public accumulation, production investment, etc., would prevent increased income despite increased production. Some members said, "A bumper harvest is certain, but after all the deductions, how much will we actually get?" Fearing that "There's something in the net, but nothing in the basket." (3) Members with high incomes and good living conditions were afraid of helping struggling households, fearing that, like last year, the money that should come in would not, "There's money on the books, but not underneath." Members with land appraisal problems also took a lukewarm attitude towards pre-distribution work, believing that they would "lose out whether they distribute or not." Some agricultural cooperative staff also had fears of trouble. However, both members and cooperative staff wanted to use pre-distribution to get a sense of the bottom line, to see how much income the cooperative actually had, to see if their own production would decrease, and to see how much surplus grain they would have to sell and how much grain they could retain. It seemed that the desire to do a good job of pre-distribution was the essential thought of the vast majority of members; as for the various concerns, they were precisely reflections of the fear that pre-distribution would not be done well. These situations showed that pre-distribution work was a requirement of the broad masses of members.

The pre-distribution pilot work of each cooperative was generally carried out in the following three steps.

First step, on the basis of improving the thinking of the cadres, each cooperative focused on production and educated members on the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. Starting with summarizing and inspecting the current production, short-term arrangements were made for production, and the significance and benefits of pre-distribution and the "three fixings" policy for grain were explained. At the same time, the members were made aware that the main reason for the high number of overdraft households last year, the failure to receive the money that should have been received, and the occurrence of rushing to withdraw and borrow was that the pre-distribution work had not been done well. On the basis of the initial improvement of the members' understanding, pre-distribution organizations were established, the accountant began to clear the accounts, and the cooperative director led the output estimation team to estimate the output.

The process of estimating the actual output was also a process of educating the members on the superiority of agricultural cooperatives with facts. Each cooperative generally did a good job in this regard. After estimating the output of existing crops, each cooperative also carried out an appraisal of the fields and crops plot by plot, using methods of comparing with last year, comparing with cooperatives outside the community, and comparing teams within the community to identify experiences in increasing production; at the same time, tapping potential, finding loopholes, and deciding on further measures to increase production, thereby overcoming the complacency of the members and strengthening their confidence in striving for a greater harvest. For example, the Lidian Fengshou Cooperative originally did not do badly in production, and the cooperative cadres and members generally developed a sense of complacency. This time, in conjunction with output estimation and inspection of production, five major loopholes in production were identified, and it was initially calculated that if these five loopholes were not plugged, a loss of forty-eight shi and five dou of rice would be incurred; this cooperative had a total of thirty-five households, which would amount to more than one shi per household. This check and calculation surprised everyone. Then, the cooperative took a series of emergency measures, such as stepping up topdressing, pest control, and replanting. As a result, apart from the fact that the rice output was already fixed and could not be remedied, the losses in other aspects could be made up for. In this way, the members' enthusiasm for production was high, with some reclaiming wasteland and others replanting, and the cooperative saw an unprecedented new scene. Some cooperatives also, in conjunction with estimating the output of late autumn crops, put forward cultivation requirements, creating conditions for contracting and guaranteeing output for late autumn crops.

In estimating output, attention should be paid to estimating the output appropriately, preventing it from being too high or too low. A small number of key cadres generally had a tendency to overestimate in order to show the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. On the contrary, general cadres and members had the idea of ​​suppressing output in order to avoid selling more surplus grain. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the significance of output estimation so that everyone has a correct understanding of output estimation. In addition to absorbing experienced veteran farmers to participate in the output estimation work, it is also necessary to consult with members while estimating, so that they can truly grasp the bottom line of output estimation. In terms of method, it is best to estimate output in the field and register plot by plot. In this way, not only can the estimate be more accurate, but also the work of tapping potential, finding tricks, and revising the plan for late autumn crops and contracting and guaranteeing output can be closely combined. Some cooperatives, in the process of estimating output, also checked the problems in land appraisal, preparing for the next step of resolving policy issues.

While estimating the output, the accountant should calculate the cooperative's total annual income account, expenditure account, and member work point account; calculate one item and announce one item, so that members can carefully review it. Accounts that have not been cleared in the past should be cleared as soon as possible. Some districts give play to the role of the accounting network, on the one hand, so that the accounts of the pilot cooperatives can be cleared in a timely manner, and on the other hand, so that the accountants of other cooperatives can learn pre-distribution, killing two birds with one stone, and the effect is very good. Some cooperatives assign a deputy director or a strong cooperative committee member to be responsible for assisting in financial work, which is also a method worth promoting.

Second step, formulate a pre-distribution plan and resolve relevant distribution policies and outstanding issues.

1. Land appraisal and land remuneration issues: The problems with paddy fields in each cooperative are generally small, and the problems with dry land are large. At the beginning, the general staff of the cooperative had a kind of resistance, thinking that the land output has "been adjusted many times, and there may not be any problems"! Thinking that "the members have no opinions, there is no need to bother." Households that did not suffer much in the appraisal believed that good and bad fields existed in every family, and it was almost the same if they were pulled together, and they did not advocate adjustment; while households that suffered more due to misunderstandings about the cooperative did not speak out even if they had opinions. After repeated education, everyone understood that suppressing output and suppressing remuneration were not conducive to the unity of middle and poor peasants and the consolidation and development of the cooperative, and unanimously recognized the importance of the appraisal and demanded fair and reasonable solutions.

Each cooperative has three approaches in handling land remuneration: Cooperatives with big problems and many opinions from members take the approach of checking plot by plot and making comprehensive adjustments. Cooperatives with small problems and individual plots with high or low appraisals adjust them individually according to the situation. Cooperatives where the members have few opinions and the land appraisal is basically close to the normal output will no longer move.

2. Deduction of public accumulation and production funds. According to the statistics of thirteen pilot cooperatives: the public welfare fund and the public accumulation fund generally account for more than 5% of the total income; eight cooperatives also retained more than 3,500 yuan of production funds for next year. The deductions are generally somewhat excessive. Twenty-three members of seven cooperatives reduced their income compared with last year, accounting for 4.6% of the 497 members of these thirteen cooperatives; among them, the Rao Xingli Cooperative, which accumulated the most public welfare fund and public accumulation fund (7%), had eleven members who reduced their income. The main reason for the large deductions is that the staff of the cooperative believe that they have a sum of money in hand, and the work will be easier to do, so as to avoid the trouble of mobilizing members to invest in the future. However, most of the members of most cooperatives are dissatisfied with too many deductions. Especially poor households with more advances are afraid of "deducting everything, and in the end, they will get nothing". From the point of view of expenditure: the administrative expenses of each cooperative are not a big problem; in terms of production investment, some cooperatives are too large. Each cooperative, in checking production, combined with checking the waste phenomenon in production investment, and formulated a plan to vigorously accumulate fertilizer and reduce the investment in late autumn crops to compensate for it.

3. Implementation of the "three fixings" policy for grain and the distribution of grain, the handling of firewood, etc. How much can be distributed, how much needs to be sold, and how much grain can be retained are the focus of consideration for every member. They are very concerned about issues such as "Will we have to sell more grain if we increase production more?" and "How much grain can we retain?". In the pre-distribution, each cooperative prepared a grain distribution plan according to the specific situation of each cooperative. Each cooperative generally put forward three methods: (1) After the grain is distributed to households according to the proportion of land and labor, the surplus grain is calculated by household and sold by household. (2) After the grain is distributed to households according to the proportion of land and labor, the surplus grain is calculated by household and sold uniformly by the cooperative. (3) After the cooperative uniformly sells the surplus grain, the rations are distributed according to the population, and each household retains sufficient rations. Generally, members with surplus grain mostly advocate using the first and second methods. The main cadres of the cooperative advocate using the third method in order to simplify the work and save trouble, and poor households want to distribute rations equally. Judging from the results of the pre-distribution of the sixteen cooperatives, the vast majority of cooperatives decided to adopt the second method. No cooperative adopted the third method. The part of the grain that exceeds the output is generally distributed according to the labor work points; a small number of cooperatives plan to distribute it according to the ratio of land three and labor seven or land two and labor eight. The method of pricing firewood and grass and distributing it together with the total income last year made many members dissatisfied, saying: "When you join the cooperative, you have to pay for firewood and grass!" Accepting this lesson, most cooperatives, according to the opinions of the members, decided not to price firewood and grass. Except for retaining a part for reserve according to needs, the rest will be distributed to the members according to the proportion of land and labor.

After the distribution plan is finalized, it should be fully deliberated among the members, repeatedly discussed and revised, and then democratically approved. Each cooperative, in conjunction with discussions, mobilizes members to make plans for each family and calculate income for each household, and carry out labor competitions between teams to strive to over-fulfill the cooperative's income plan.

Third step, do a good job of preparing for autumn harvest and distribution. Each cooperative mainly grasped the following three points: (1) Establish security, inspection and other groups to strengthen security and strictly prevent sabotage. Some cooperatives also combined with the establishment of a management team, checked the shortcomings in the previous stage of management work, and formulated management covenants. (2) Set a good plan for harvesting, threshing, sending grain, distribution, etc., adhere to the practice of harvesting, distributing, and sending grain at any time, and at the same time make good material preparations. (3) Educate members on meticulous harvesting and threshing, and returning every grain to the home. Also educate members to be careful in their personal calculations, so as to achieve a long-term flow of water.

Through this period of work, each cooperative has undergone three obvious changes: (1) The production atmosphere in the cooperative is very strong, and fertilizer accumulation and crop replacement are carried out enthusiastically. (2) The socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the members have been greatly improved. Some members who originally planned to withdraw from the cooperative and did not work hard (about 40 households in the 16 cooperatives) are now in a stable mood, and to varying degrees, they have recognized the superiority of the cooperative, complaining that they have not worked hard in the past, and they all want to actively "catch up". (3) The leadership enthusiasm of the staff of the cooperative has also been improved. Cadres who used to think that the difficulties in the cooperative were great and the members' awareness was low are now leading the members with full confidence to strive for a greater harvest.

    作好秋收分配，巩固农业合作社
    ——浠水县十六个农业合作社秋收预分试点经过
  　杜希
    为了取得秋收分配经验，正确地指导全县农业合作社的分配工作，中共湖北省浠水县委派人在望城乡十六个社进行了预分试点工作。十六个社在生产上有如下三种情况：（一）个别社由于夏收作物减产，有些户缺粮，社员生产积极性不高。（二）有部分社前一时期受到了旱灾的威胁，社员对争取丰收信心不足。认为“粮食还在天上，谷要收在箩筐里才算数”！（三）生产较好的社，则有一种自满情绪。认为“丰收到了手，只等着拿镰割谷”。总的说来，生产劲头都不大。
    各社社员对预分是既有顾虑又有要求的。主要思想顾虑是：（一）对粮食“三定”不放心，怕把产量估高了要多卖余粮。有些社的社员甚至认为预分就是摸统购的底儿。（二）怕社干部不正确执行预分政策，怕公共积累、生产投资等扣多了，增了产不能增加收入。有的社员说：“丰产是无疑的，七折八扣，晓得分到多大一点？”怕“打在网里有，装在箩里没得”。（三）收入多、生活好的社员，怕拉帮困难户，怕像去年一样，应进的钱进不到，“账上有，账下无”。在土地评产上有问题的社员，认为自己“分也是吃亏，不分也是吃亏”，对预分工作也采取一种冷淡态度。农业社的工作人员中还有怕麻烦思想。但是社员和社的工作人员都想通过预分摸一下底儿，看社里到底有多大收入，看自己到底减不减产，看到底要卖多少余粮，留多少口粮。看来，要想把预分工作搞好，是社员的本质思想；至如种种顾虑，正是怕预分搞不好的思想反映。这些情况说明预分工作是广大社员的要求。
    各社的预分试点工作大体是分如下三个步骤进行的。
    第一步，各社在提高干部思想的基础上，都突出地抓紧了生产，向社员进行了农业合作社的优越性的教育。先从总结、检查当时生产入手，将生产作了短期安排，说明了预分和粮食“三定”政策的意义和好处。同时，还使社员认识到：去年超支户多，应进钱的进不到，以及发生抢支抢借现象，主要就是预分工作没有作好。在社员认识初步提高的基础上，成立了预分组织，会计着手清理账目，社长领导估产小组进行估产。
    估实产量的过程，也就是以事实向社员进行农业合作社优越性教育的过程。各社在这方面一般都作得很好。估出现有作物产量后，各社还对田地作物逐丘逐块地进行了一次鉴定，用同去年比、同社外比、队同队比的办法找出增产经验；同时，挖潜力、找漏洞，决定进一步采取的增产措施，从而克服了社员的自满情绪，坚定了争取更大丰收的信心。如里店丰收社原来生产就搞得不坏，社干部和社员普遍滋长自满情绪。这次结合估产检查生产找出了生产上的五大漏洞，初步计算这五个漏洞如果不堵住就要损失稻谷四十八石五斗；这个社一共三十五户，摊到每户就是一石多。这样一检查算账，才使大家大吃一惊。接着这个社采取了一系列紧急措施，如抓紧上脚肥、除虫、补种等，结果除水稻产量已成定局无法补救外，其他方面的损失，都可以弥补起来。这样一来社员生产情绪高涨，开荒的开荒，补种的补种，社里出现了前所未有的新景象。有些社还结合着估计晚秋作物产量，提出了耕作要求，给晚秋作物的包工、包产创造了条件。
    估产中要注意把产量估得恰当，防止偏高偏低。少数主要干部，为了显示农业合作社的优越性，在估产上一般有偏高思想。相反的一般干部和社员为了怕多卖余粮，又有压低产量思想。因此，要反复说明估产的意义，使大家对估产有正确认识。估产工作除了要吸收有经验的老农参加外，还要作到边估边和社员商量，这样才能使他们真正摸到估产的底。在方法上，顶好是登田估产，逐丘登记。这样，不仅可以估计得更精确，而且可以把挖潜力、找窍门、修订晚秋作物计划和包工包产等工作密切结合起来。有些社在估产当中，还结合着检查了土地评产方面的问题，给下一步解决政策遗留问题作好了准备。
    在估好产量的同时，会计要算好全社全年收入账、开支账和社员工分账；算出一笔，公布一笔，让社员详细审查。过去账目未结清的要抓紧结清。有些区发挥会计网的作用，一方面使试点社的账目能及时清算出来，一方面又使别的社的会计学习了预分，一举两得，效果很好。有些社分派一个副社长或一个强的社委负责协助搞财务工作，也是值得推广的办法。
    第二步，制定预分方案、解决有关分配政策和遗留问题。
    一、土地评产和土地报酬问题：各社一般水田问题较小，旱地问题较大。开始社里一般工作人员都有一种抵触情绪，认为土地产量“调整多次了，未必还有问题”！认为“社员没有意见，不必空讨麻烦”。在评产上吃亏不大的户，认为好坏田家家有一点，一拉差不多，也不主张调整；而吃亏较大的户，则由于对合作社有误解，有意见也不说。经过再三教育，大家懂得了压低产量、压低报酬，对中、贫农团结和社的巩固发展不利，一致认识了评产的重要，要求公平合理解决。
    各社在处理土地报酬方面，有三种作法：问题大、社员意见多的社，采取逐丘检查、全面调整的作法。问题不大、个别田评产偏高偏低的社，则根据情况个别调整。社员意见不大，土地评产基本上接近了常年产量的，即不再动。
    二、公共积累和生产资金的扣除问题。据十三个试点社的统计：公积金、公益金一般都占总收入的百分之五以上；有八个社还提存了明年的生产资金三千五百多元。扣除一般是有些过大的。有七个社的二十三户社员比去年减少了收入，占这十三个社四百九十七户社员的百分之四点六；其中公积金、公益金积累最多的（百分之七）饶兴礼社，就有十一户社员减少了收入。扣除大的原因主要是社的工作人员认为手上有了一笔款子，工作就好做些，免得将来去动员社员投资麻烦。但是，大多数社的大部分社员对扣除太多是不满意的。特别是借支多了的困难户，怕“七折八扣，账一算，落得一场空”。从开支方面看：行政管理费各社问题还不大；在生产投资方面有些社则过大。各社在检查生产当中结合检查了生产投资上的浪费现象，并订出计划，大力积肥，减低晚秋作物投资，以资补偿。
    三、粮食“三定”政策的贯彻和粮食的分配、柴草的处理等问题。能分配多少，需要卖多少，能留多少粮食，是每个社员考虑的焦点。他们很关心“到底多增产是不是要多卖粮”、“到底能留多少口粮”等问题。各社在预分中，根据各社具体情况作好了粮食分配方案。各社一般提出了三种办法：（一）粮食按土地劳力比例分配到户后，余粮分户计算，分户出卖。（二）粮食按土地劳力比例分配到户后，余粮分户计算，由社统一出卖。（三）由社统一出卖余粮后，按人口分摊口粮，每户口粮都留足。一般有余粮的社员多主张采用一、二两种办法。社的主要干部为了工作简单省事，困难户想平均分配口粮，都主张采用第三种办法。从十六个社的预分结果看：绝大多数社都决定采用第二种办法。没有一个社采用第三种办法。粮食超产部分，一般是按劳动工分分配；少数社准备按地三劳七或地二劳八的比例分配。去年采用柴草作价、连同总收入一起分配的办法，使得不少社员不满，他们说：“入了社，连柴草也要钱买！”接受这一教训，多数社根据社员意见，决定柴草不作价，除根据需要提存一部备用外，其余均按地劳比例分给社员。
    分配方案定好后，在社员中充分酝酿，反复讨论修改，然后民主通过。各社结合讨论，发动社员家家定计划，户户算收入，开展队同队间的劳动竞赛，争取超额完成社的收入计划。
    第三步，作好秋收和分配准备工作。各社主要抓住了如下三点：（一）成立保卫、检查等小组，加强保卫，严防破坏。有的社还结合成立保管小组，检查了上一段保管工作中的缺点，订出了保管公约。（二）定好收割、打场、送粮、分配等计划，坚持随打、随分、随送的作法，同时作好物质上的
  一切准备。（三）向社员进行细收细打，颗粒还家的教育。还教育社员个人也要精打细算，作到细水长流。
    通过这段工作，各社明显地有三大变化：（一）社里的生产空气非常浓厚，积肥、改种搞得火热。（二）社员的社会主义觉悟和劳动积极性都大大提高了。有些原来打算退社、劳动不下劲的社员（十六个社约有四十户），现在情绪稳定了，都不同程度地认识了合作社的优越性，埋怨自己过去没有努力，都想积极地“赶一把”。（三）社的工作人员的领导劲头也提高了。过去认为社内困难大，社员觉悟低的干部，现在都信心百倍地领导社员争取更大丰收。
