Peasants are Happy to Take the Road of Cooperativization
National People's Congress Representative Xu Baoju

Agricultural cooperativization is the only path to guide peasants towards socialism. Peasants are happy to take this road. I deeply understood this point after inspecting twelve townships and towns in the Jinhua area of Zhejiang in May and June this year.

The total grain output in the Jinhua area was about 2.9 billion jin in 1951; in 1952, a comprehensive bumper harvest reached approximately 3.23 billion jin; in 1953, due to drought, the total output was about 3.03 billion jin; in 1954, despite continuous floods and droughts, the total output still reached 3.15 billion jin. One of the main reasons for the relatively high output despite the disasters was that agricultural production cooperatives drove mutual aid teams and individual farmers to carry out a super-production increase campaign throughout the region. During the spring plowing season last year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the Jinhua area increased from forty-two to four hundred and eighty-six; during the summer flood prevention and drainage period, more than one hundred cooperatives were developed; with the development of the super-production increase campaign, agricultural cooperatives in the region developed rapidly. By the end of the year, there were 11,782 cooperatives in the region, with participating peasant households accounting for 29 percent of the total number of households (since the spring of this year, after rectification of the 11,782 cooperatives in the region, 3,421 cooperatives have been converted into mutual aid teams; the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has decreased from 29 percent to 21 percent of the total peasant households.), and 175 townships were basically cooperativized.

Due to the increasing socialist consciousness of the peasants, coupled with the great role played by agricultural cooperatives in the flood drainage and drought resistance campaign to protect the autumn harvest, demonstrating the superiority of unified management through organization, the peasants' enthusiasm for running cooperatives greatly increased. The Ganxi Township of Jinhua expanded from four cooperatives with ninety households this spring to ten cooperatives with six hundred and forty-three households. A large number of middle peasants also joined the agricultural cooperatives. The original four cooperatives in the township had nineteen middle peasant households, accounting for 9 percent of the total middle peasant households; now, one hundred and eighty-seven middle peasant households have joined the agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 88 percent of the total middle peasant households. Middle peasant Chen Fengqiu originally had many concerns and did not want to join the agricultural cooperative; after propaganda and education, and seeing that the old cooperative had overcome the drought and increased production, he voluntarily requested to join. Middle peasant Wang Gengen said: "The small-peasant economy is uncertain about tomorrow; although it is good today, a single illness can cause one to fall and never get up. Joining an agricultural cooperative can withstand illness and disasters."

Agricultural cooperatives are indeed capable of overcoming disasters. In last year's drought resistance and autumn harvest protection campaign, agricultural cooperatives used collective strength to dig ditches and open ponds, relay water, and carry water to irrigate seedlings, ensuring a bumper late-season harvest or reducing the disasters to a minimum. In the Gandong Township of Jinhua, more than 7,000 mu of late-season crops were generally irrigated three times, increasing production by more than 20 percent compared to the previous year. The masses reflected that even fields that had never been irrigated before were now being irrigated. Under the leadership of the agricultural cooperative, the peasants of Duohu Township persisted in resisting drought for more than eighty days, mobilized more than 130 waterwheels, and irrigated the fields day and night, putting forward the slogan "Irrigate every mu of land, ensure a bumper harvest, support industrialization, and support the liberation of Taiwan." Agricultural cooperatives also showed their superiority in drainage. For example, the Xijiang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhuji put forward the slogan "Compete with floods for grain," persisted in resisting floods and draining water for more than forty days, overcame five floods, and finally rescued 367 mu of early rice, yielding 300 jin per mu (100 jin more per mu than the local mutual aid teams). After I left the Jinhua area and returned to Beijing in mid-June this year, I soon learned that Zhuji had suffered another severe flood. At that time, I was extremely anxious for the local peasants. Recently, I was very happy to learn that the members of the Xijiang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhuji had finally overcome the disaster after fighting the flood for four days and four nights, and the early rice yield was still the highest in history. After the preliminary distribution of more than 1,000 mu of early rice in the whole cooperative, the remuneration for each labor day increased by more than double compared to last year. The members proudly said: "The flood cannot wash away our bumper harvest." It was not only this one cooperative that overcame the disaster and obtained a bumper harvest. The summer harvest crops of 38,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Zhejiang Province generally increased production this year.

Many things are impossible for individual farmers to do, and difficult for mutual aid teams to do; however, with agricultural cooperatives, it is relatively easy to do. Agricultural cooperatives have fully exploited the potential of land and labor. In the spring of 1954, the agricultural production cooperative in Zhuji County led mutual aid teams and individual farmers to improve more than 33,000 mu of soil. Surveys in eight townships showed that in 1954, 6,400 mu of continuous cropping rice was planted, and in 1955, it was expanded to more than 13,000 mu. In 1954, the county expanded the winter planting area by more than 66,000 mu, an increase of 71 percent compared to 1953. Among them, the production of oil crops in particular exceeded the state plan, expanding by more than two times compared to 1953. For example, the Shanghua Cooperative in Xiayu Township, Lanxi, with 371 households, is expected to convert 71 mu of dry land into paddy fields this year, which can increase production by 17,750 jin; convert 1,200 mu of single-season rice into double-season rice, which can increase production by 70,000 jin; improve 950 mu of soil, which can increase production by 76,000 jin; 120 new members, with 800 mu of land, will implement technological reforms, which can increase production by 80,000 jin; low-yielding late-season crops will be converted to high-yielding crops on 300 mu, which can increase production by 30,000 jin; the field ridges (i.e., field boundaries) will be dug up, expanding the cultivated area by 7.5 mu, which can increase production by 3,750 jin. The total increase in production is 277,500 jin, an average increase of more than 700 jin per household.

Agricultural cooperatives are better than mutual aid teams and even better than individual farmers in adopting advanced production experience and grasping production time. This year, agricultural cooperatives in the Jinhua area generally adopted advanced experiences such as mud and salt water seed selection, cultivating strong seedlings, rational close planting of rice, and false seedling transplanting of wheat fields. In the rush to harvest wheat, agricultural cooperatives also harvested faster than mutual aid teams and even faster than individual farmers, which could reduce losses.

Agricultural cooperatives have sufficient manpower and material resources to develop diversified economies. The Shanghua Cooperative in Lanxi raises 14,000 fish, with a net income of more than 5,000 yuan; raises 60 bee colonies, with an estimated income of 1,000 yuan; plants water chestnuts in fourteen large ponds, with an income of more than 4,700 yuan; the whole cooperative raised 421 pigs in May (365 in the same period last year); and hatching chicks can also generate an income of 600 yuan. In addition, there are transportation, blacksmithing, and other sideline occupations. In total, the cooperative can earn more than 15,000 yuan from sideline occupations this year, equivalent to more than 232,000 jin of grain, an average of more than 600 jin per household. They also planted 2,000 mulberry seedlings, 2,000 tallow trees, and 5,000 honey peach trees, which will generate more income in the future.

In agricultural production increase, fertilizer is a rather serious problem. In the Jinhua area, from last autumn to this spring, driven by the cooperativization movement, a mass and large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched, with great achievements in digging pond mud, burning mud ash, and shoveling turf. The masses reflected that they had never accumulated so much fertilizer before. The amount of soil fertilizer accumulated last winter increased by more than double compared to the previous year. Ganxi Township dug more than 170,000 dan of pond mud and shoveled turf, exceeding the total amount in the four years since liberation, reducing the cost of spring flower crop cultivation and achieving a bumper harvest. The wheat harvest generally yielded more than 130 jin per mu, and many agricultural cooperatives yielded more than 200 jin per mu.

Agricultural cooperatives also have greater strength in land reclamation. The Shenze Agricultural Cooperative in Pan'an County reclaimed 150 mu of wasteland last winter and this spring, all planted with corn and sweet potatoes, which can increase grain by more than 17,000 jin. The Fengshou Cooperative in Ganxi Township also organized a land reclamation team to go out and reclaim land.

In recent years, agricultural cooperatives have significantly increased production. For example, in Anping Township, Zhuji County, the average rice yield per mu in 1952 was 490 jin, while the agricultural cooperative averaged 626 jin per mu; in 1953, the average for the whole township was 510 jin per mu, while the agricultural cooperative averaged 670 jin per mu; in 1954, the average for the whole township was 578 jin per mu, and the output of the agricultural cooperative increased again compared to 1953. As agricultural cooperatives increased production, the income of the members also increased. For example, in the first cooperative of the Xijiang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhuji County, each labor day was allocated 18 jin and 12 liang of paddy in 1953; in 1954, despite being hit by floods, the allocation per labor day increased to 20 jin and 12 liang; the 81 households in the cooperative increased by more than 1,000 jin of paddy on average per household, with the highest increase being more than 8,000 jin; the whole cooperative sold 494,000 jin of surplus grain. After the income of the agricultural cooperatives increased, the economic and cultural life of the members also improved. The Shanghua Cooperative in Lanxi County established three primary schools, six folk schools, a library, and organized three amateur theatrical troupes. The number of married men and women in the whole cooperative also increased, with 34 couples in February this year.

The fact that agricultural cooperatives increased production and income made the vast number of peasants deeply realize that organizing is the road to common prosperity, and made socialist factors continue to grow in the countryside. The peasants generally reflected: "The old road of one family rich and thousands of families poor is not feasible. We turned over and were liberated thanks to Chairman Mao. We cannot forget the past suffering." Many peasants urgently demanded to be organized, and many peasant activists brought their own food and bedding to the old cooperatives to learn, preparing to run cooperatives.

From many examples, peasants are happy to take the road of cooperativization, and the cooperativization movement in the Jinhua area has achieved results. However, in the development of the cooperativization movement, some problems also occurred. Last year, the work of developing agricultural cooperatives in some villages was somewhat rough, and a small number of cooperatives did not meet the conditions. However, this year, in the rectification, some places have done it somewhat roughly again, and some that could be maintained and consolidated after rectification have also been shut down and converted into mutual aid teams. This is not in line with the requirements of the peasant masses. The mutual benefit policies of some cooperatives have not been implemented well, the land valuation and distribution ratios are unreasonable, and the depreciation of other means of production is too low; the labor management and financial management of some cooperatives are somewhat chaotic, and they still adopt the methods of large-group work, temporary division of labor, and daily scoring of mutual aid teams. These problems should be paid attention to and solved. We must not forget that China is a country where the small-peasant economy dominates. To organize hundreds of millions of peasants into agricultural production cooperatives, we must do a lot of hard work and go through some necessary transitional forms. The handling of the peasants' privately owned means of production should be very cautious. Only on the basis of the peasants' willingness to accept it, through the preliminary form of cooperativization, combined with preliminary technical improvement, can it be gradually transitioned to the advanced form of cooperativization, combined with agricultural mechanization and other technical reforms, so that China's agricultural production can continue to progress and China's countryside can become a socialist new countryside.

    农民是乐于走合作化的道路的
    全国人民代表大会代表  许宝驹
    农业的合作化，是引导农民走向社会主义的唯一道路。农民是乐于走这条道路的。我在今年五、六月间视察了浙江金华地区的十二个乡、镇以后，深切地了解到了这一点。
    金华地区粮食总产量，一九五一年为二十九亿斤左右；一九五二年全面丰收，约达三十二亿三千万斤；一九五三年受旱，总产量约三十亿三千多万斤；一九五四年又连遭洪涝旱灾，总产量仍达三十一亿五千万斤。受了灾而产量仍然相当高的主要原因之一，就是农业生产合作社带动了互助组和单干农民在全区范围内开展了超额增产运动。去年春耕期间，金华地区的农业生产合作社由四十二个发展到了四百八十六个；在夏季防洪排涝期间，又发展了一百多个；随着超额增产运动的开展，全区农业合作社有了迅速的发展，到年底全区有了一万一千七百八十二个社，参加的农户占总户数（今年春季以来，全区的一万一千七百八十二个社，经过整顿，有三千四百二十一个社转为互助组了；入社农户由总农户的百分之二十九下降到了百分之二十一。）的百分之二十九，有一百七十五个乡基本合作化。
    由于农民的社会主义觉悟的提高，加上在排涝和抗旱保秋运动中农业合作社发挥了很大作用，显示了组织起来统一经营的优越性，农民的办社积极性大大提高了。金华干西乡由今春的四个社九十户扩大到十个社六百四十三户。大批中农也参加了农业合作社。全乡原来的四个社有十九户中农，占中农总户数的百分之九；现在参加农业合作社的中农有一百八十七户，占中农总户数的百分之八十八。中农陈凤球原来顾虑很多，不想参加农业合作社；经过宣传教育，他又看到老社战胜旱灾增产了，就自动地要求入社。中农王基根说：“小农经济是今天不知明天事，现在虽不错，只要一场病，就跌倒爬不起，参加农业合作社才能经得起一病二灾。”
    农业合作社的确是能够战胜灾害的。在去年抗旱保秋运动中，农业合作社运用集体力量，挖沟开潭，接力车水，挑水浇苗，保证了后熟丰收或者将灾害减少到了最低限度。金华干东乡七千多亩后熟作物普遍车水灌溉三遍，比前年增产二成以上。群众反映：从来没车过水的田也车上水了。多湖乡农民在农业合作社带头下坚持抗旱八十多天，出动一百三十多部水车，日夜车水灌田，提出了“每亩田都灌上水，保证丰收，支援工业化，支援解放台湾”的口号。在排涝中，农业合作社也显示了优越性。如诸暨西江农业合作社提出“同洪涝争粮”的口号，坚持抗洪排涝四十多天，战胜五次洪灾，终于抢救了三百六十七亩田的早稻，每亩收三百斤（比当地互助组每亩多收一百斤）。我在今年六月中旬离开金华地区回到北京以后，不久就知道诸暨又遭到严重的洪水侵袭，当时我为当地农民万分焦虑，最近我又万分愉快地知道诸暨西江农业合作社的社员们经过四天四夜同洪水搏斗后，终于战胜灾害，早稻产量仍是历史上最高的。全社一千多亩早稻预支分配结果，每个劳动日的报酬比去年增加一倍多，社员自豪地说：“洪水冲不了我们的丰收。”战胜灾害得到丰收的并不只是这一个社，浙江省三万八千个农业生产合作社今年夏收作物普遍增产了。
    许多事情是单干农民办不到的，互助组办起来也困难；可是，有了农业合作社，就比较好办了。农业合作社充分发挥了土地、人力的潜力。一九五四年春，诸暨县农业生产合作社带动互助组和单干农民改良了土壤三万三千多亩。八个乡调查：一九五四年种连作稻六千四百亩，一九五五年扩种到一万三千多亩。全县一九五四年扩大冬种面积六万六千多亩，比一九五三年扩大百分之七十一。其中特别是油料作物的生产，超额完成了国家计划，比一九五三年扩大二倍多。又如兰溪下余乡上华社，三百七十一户，今年预计旱地改水田七十一亩，可增产一万七千七百五十斤；单季稻改双季稻一千二百亩，可增产七万斤；改良土壤九百五十亩，可增产七万六千斤；新社员一百二十户，有八百亩土地，实行技术改革，可增产八万斤；后熟作物低产量，改种高产量作物三百亩，可增产三万斤；田塍（即田界）掘了，扩大耕地面积七亩五分，可增产三千七百五十斤。以上共可增产二十七万七千五百斤，平均每户可增产七百多斤。
    农业合作社在采用先进生产经验和掌握生产时间方面都比互助组好，比单干农民更好。今年，金华地区的农业合作社普遍接受了泥水、盐水选种，培育壮苗，水稻的合理密植和小麦田的假秧移植等先进经验。在抢收小麦中，农业合作社也比互助组收得快，比单干农民更快，这样就可以减少损失。
    农业合作社有充足的人力物力，可以发展多样经济。兰溪上华社养鱼一万四千条，纯收入可达五千多元；养蜂六十群，约可收入一千元；种菱角十四个大塘，可收入四千七百多元；全社五月份养猪四百二十一头（去年同期三百六十五头）；还有孵小鸡可收入六百元。此外还有运输、打铁等副业。总计全社今年可由副业收入一万五千多元，折谷二十三万二千多斤，平均每户可得到六百多斤。他们还种了桑苗二千株，桕子树二千株，水蜜桃五千株，将来可以有更多的收入。
    在农业增产中，肥料是个相当严重的问题。金华全区去年秋后到今年春季，在合作化运动的推动下，展开了群众性的规模宏大的积肥运动，挖塘泥、烧泥灰、铲草皮等，都有很大成绩。群众反映：从来没有积过这样多的肥。去年冬季积土肥比前年增加一倍以上。干西乡即挖塘泥、铲草泥等共十七万多担，超过解放以来四年的总数，降低了春花作物培育的成本，取得丰收。小麦的收成，一般每亩能收一百三十斤以上，不少农业合作社每亩收到二百斤以上。
    农业合作社在开荒方面也有较大的力量。磐安县深泽农业合作社去冬今春开荒一百五十亩，都种上了玉米、蕃薯，可增加粮食一万七千多斤。干西乡丰收社也组织了开荒队出外开荒。
    几年来，农业合作社显著地增产了。如诸暨县安平乡一九五二年水稻产量平均每亩为四百九十斤，农业合作社每亩平均六百二十六斤；一九五三年全乡每亩平均五百一十斤，农业合作社每亩平均六百七十斤；一九五四年全乡每亩平均五百七十八斤，农业合作社的产量比一九五三年又有增加。农业合作社增产了，社员的收入也就增加了。如诸暨县西江农业合作社第一社一九五三年每个劳动日分红稻谷十八斤十二两；一九五四年虽受洪涝灾害袭击，每个劳动日分红却增加为二十斤十二两；全社八十一户，平均每户要增加一千斤稻谷以上，最高的增加八千多斤；全社出卖余粮四十九万四千斤。农业合作社收入增加后，社员的经济生活和文化生活也有了改善。兰溪县上华社，办了三个小学，六个民校，一个图书馆，组织了三个业余剧团。全社结婚的男女也增多了，今年二月份就有三十四对。
    农业合作社增加生产、增加收入的事实，使广大农民深刻地体会到组织起来是大家富裕的道路，使社会主义因素在农村不断增长。农民普遍反映：“一家富、千家穷的老路走不得，我们靠毛主席翻了身，不能忘记以前的苦。”许多农民迫切要求组织起来，不少农民积极分子自带伙食被褥到老社去学习，准备办社。
    从许多事例看来，农民是乐于走合作化的道路的，金华地区的合作化运动是有成绩的。但是，在合作化运动的发展中，也发生了一些问题。去年，有些乡村发展农业合作社的工作有些粗糙，小部分社是不够条件的。但是，今年在整顿中，有些地方又做得有些粗糙了，把一些经过整顿可以维持和巩固下来的也停办了，转为互助组了。这是不符合农民群众的要求的。有些社互利政策贯彻得不好，土地评产和分配比例不合理，其他生产资料折价偏低；有些社的劳动管理和财务管理有些混乱，仍采用互助组大组干活、临时分工、天天评分的办法。这些问题是应当注意解决的。我们切不可忘记：我国是小农经济占优势的国家，要把几万万农民组织到农业生产合作社里，必须做很多艰苦的工作，通过一些必要的过渡形式。处理农民私有的生产资料应当十分慎重。只有在农民乐于接受的基础上，经过初级形式的合作化，结合初步的技术改良，才可能逐渐地过渡到高级形式的合作化，结合农业机械化和其他技术改革，使我国的农业生产不断地进步，使我国的农村变成社会主义的新农村。
