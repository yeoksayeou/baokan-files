Reader's Letters Column:

    A Neglectful "Traveler"

    To the Editor:
    The "Reader's Letters" page on August 21, in the article "Oppose Treating Confidential Work with a Careless Attitude," exposed the fact that Li Ruitang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Central-South Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, handed over confidential documents to strangers, resulting in them being defrauded. However, Li Ruitang is not only politically extremely apathetic; he is also a neglectful and undisciplined worker.

    In June of this year, the Central-South Design Bureau was intensely carrying out a campaign to practice thrift and oppose waste. One day, Li Ruitang suddenly left his post on his own for a "business trip." He left a note for Director Zhang saying: "I'm going to the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways in Beijing to report on my work. On my way back from Beijing, I'll stop by Zhengzhou to check on the work of the Survey and Design Team."

    Why did Li Ruitang go to Beijing when the internal work of the organization was so busy? Why didn't he discuss the work report with everyone beforehand? Director Zhang was a little worried, so three days later he called the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways. The Political Department replied, "We haven't seen Deputy Director Li come here." Director Zhang waited three more days and called again, but the answer was still "We haven't seen him." Director Zhang immediately called the Survey and Design Team in Zhengzhou, and they also said that Deputy Director Li had not gone there. Half a month passed, and Deputy Director Li was still nowhere to be found, which made people wonder if something unexpected had happened on the way. Because of this incident, the entire staff of the Political Department became uneasy; relevant leading organs in Wuhan City also asked the Political Department to send someone to look for Li Ruitang's whereabouts.

    Just when everyone was very anxious, Li Ruitang suddenly returned on the afternoon of July 3. Where had Deputy Director Li gone for more than twenty days? It turned out that he had used the excuse of "going to Beijing to report on work" to travel around several major cities in the south. He should have taken the Beijing-Hankou railway train north, but instead he took the Yuehan railway train to Guangzhou. After traveling in Guangzhou for a few days, Li Ruitang remembered the saying "Above there is paradise, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou," and felt that it would be a lifelong regret if he didn't visit West Lake in Hangzhou, so he took a train to Hangzhou. Having already arrived in Hangzhou, it seemed like a loss if he didn't spend a few days in Shanghai, so Li Ruitang also "conveniently" went to Shanghai. In this way, he didn't arrive in Beijing until the end of June. In Beijing, Li Ruitang spent half a day complaining to the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways about the criticism he received at the organization's Party branch meeting, saying that the Party members' criticism of his shortcomings was an attack on him. During the conversation, he did not report on any work.

    Li Ruitang was of course very happy to have toured these major cities; there was only one thing that was not very pleasant, which, as already revealed in the "Reader's Letters" page, was that his luggage, clothes, and some important confidential documents were defrauded on the way.

    If we calculate the train fare for Li Ruitang's trip (of course, it was free for him), the value would be over 300 yuan; other expenses would of course also be considerable. More seriously, such a serious act of being unorganized, undisciplined, and neglectful of duty, occurring in a responsible person like the Deputy Director of the Political Department, has created an extremely bad political influence. Li Ruitang's error should be dealt with accordingly.

### 一个玩忽职守的“旅行家”

    一个玩忽职守的“旅行家”编辑同志：
    八月二十一日“读者来信专页”“反对用漫不经心的态度对待保密工作”一文中揭发了铁道部中南设计分局政治处副主任李瑞堂把机密文件交给不相识的人以致被骗走的事实。但是，李瑞堂不仅是个政治上极端麻痹的人；而且还是一个玩忽职守、无组织无纪律的工作人员。
    今年六月间，中南设计分局厉行节约、反对浪费的运动正在紧张地进行着。一天，李瑞堂忽然自行离开工作岗位“出差”了。他给张主任留下一个纸条说：“我到北京铁道部政治部汇报工作去，从北京回来时，路过郑州检查一下勘测设计总队的工作。”
    为什么李瑞堂要在机关内部工作正忙的时候到北京去呢？汇报工作为什么事先不同大家研究一下呢？张主任有些不放心，三天以后就打电话问铁道部政治部。政治部回答说：“没有见到李副主任来。”张主任等了三天又打电话问，答复仍然是“没有见到”。张主任马上打电话问住在郑州的勘测设计总队，他们也说李副主任没有去。半个月过去了，李副主任依然下落不明，这使人不能不考虑到途中是否发生了意外。为这件事，整个政治处的工作人员都不安起来；武汉市有关领导机关知道这个消息后也要政治处派专人寻找李瑞堂的下落。
    正在大家十分焦急的时候，李瑞堂在七月三日下午突然回来了。二十多天的时间里，李副主任究竟到哪里去了呢？原来，他以“去北京汇报工作”为借口周游了南方几个大城市。他本来应该乘京汉线的火车向北行，结果却乘粤汉线的火车到了广州。在广州游历了几天，李瑞堂想起了“上有天堂，下有苏杭”的民谚，感到如果不到杭州西湖逛逛真是一生的遗憾，于是他就乘车到了杭州。已经到了杭州，如果不到上海玩几天，似乎也是一个损失，李瑞堂又“顺便”到了上海。这样，到六月底他才来到北京。在北京李瑞堂用了半天的时间向铁道部政治部控告他们机关党支部大会对他的批评，说党员们批评他的缺点是攻击他。在谈话中，他丝毫没有汇报什么工作情况。
    李瑞堂游览了这些大城市，当然心里非常高兴；只是有一件事情不很愉快，这就是“读者来信专页”中已经揭发的，在途中，他的行李、衣服和一些重要机密文件都被人骗走了。
    如果把李瑞堂这次旅行的火车费用计算一下（当然他是免费的），价值就在三百元以上；其它费用当然也相当可观。而更严重的是：这种严重的无组织无纪律和玩忽职守的行动，发生在政治处副主任这样一个负责人员身上，它所造成的政治影响是极端恶劣的。李瑞堂这种错误应该受到应有的处理。
