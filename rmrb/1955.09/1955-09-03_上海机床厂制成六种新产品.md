The state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has recently successfully trial-produced six new products, including special grinders, surface grinders, cylindrical grinders, and a set of hydraulic equipment. These machine tools have been successively shipped to key construction units such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Project for use.

These new products are all high-precision Soviet-style machine tools with a wide range of uses. The CK371 surface grinder, for example, is a first-class precision machine tool. Its tolerance in grinding workpieces is only half a silk (equivalent to one-fourteenth the thickness of a hair) within 500 centimeters. The 3430 camshaft grinder is a special semi-automatic grinder, which is needed to grind the camshafts on automobile and tractor engines. The 3161 cylindrical grinder is also an indispensable workhorse for the automobile industry, tractor industry, bearing industry, aircraft industry, and other machine tool industries. These successfully trial-produced machine tools have undergone rigorous technical appraisals, and the CK371 surface grinder has now begun mass production.

    上海机床厂制成六种新产品
    国营上海机床厂最近试制成功六种新产品，其中有特种磨床、平面磨床、外圆磨床和一套液压设备。这些机床已经先后运往第一汽车制造厂、鞍山钢铁公司、武汉长江大桥工程处等重点建设单位使用。
    这些新产品都是精密度很高的苏联式机床，用途很广泛。像CK371平面磨床就是一级精度机床，它磨制工作物的公差，五百公分以内只差半丝（相等于一根头发的十四分之一粗）。3430凸轮轴磨床是一种专用的半自动化磨床，制造汽车、拖拉机引擎上的桃子轴都需要用它来磨制。还有3161外圆磨床，也是汽车工业、拖拉机工业、轴承工业、飞机工业以及其它机床工业不可缺少的工作母机。这些试制成功的机床都经过严格的技术鉴定，其中CK371平面磨床现在已经开始成批生产。
