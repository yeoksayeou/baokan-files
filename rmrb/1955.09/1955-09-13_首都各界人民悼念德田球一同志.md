Xinhua News Agency, 12th. More than 5,000 people from all walks of life in the capital went to the Taimiao Hall of the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace this afternoon to mourn Comrade Tokuda Kyuichi, a close friend of the Chinese people and the glorious son of the Japanese people, the General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party.

At 4 o'clock, people slowly entered the hall to the sound of mournful music. Leading the way was Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Peng Zhen and Deng Xiaoping, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and heads of departments and members of the CPC Central Committee, followed by the heads of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC and representatives of people from all walks of life in the capital.

In a sad and solemn mood, people walked past the remains and portrait of Comrade Tokuda Kyuichi to express their deepest condolences to him.

In the center of the hall, on the altar between two pots of evergreen bonsai pine, rested the remains of this glorious son of the Japanese people, who had fallen asleep forever. On the silver-gray wall behind the remains hung a huge portrait of him, surrounded by black纱. It was he who dedicated his life entirely to the cause of liberation of the Japanese people.

In the mourning hall, a huge horizontal banner with white characters on a black background read: "Comrade Tokuda Kyuichi Will Live Forever." This was inscribed by Comrade Mao Zedong himself.

The hall was filled with wreaths.
