    On the fertile Hetao Plain of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, over 1.16 million mu of millet have begun to be harvested. According to field observations, the average yield is about 210 jin per mu, exceeding the abundant harvest level of 1954. Some areas can even yield over 400 jin per mu.
    This year, the area sown with millet on the Hetao Plain increased by more than 130,000 mu compared to last year. Over 80% of the area adopted the "narrow row, sparse sowing" method. Most of the fields were fertilized and received timely irrigation, resulting in excellent growth.
    Millet is a staple food favored by farmers of all ethnic groups on the Hetao Plain. Every year, farmers also make a large amount of fried millet to supply to Mongolian herdsmen on the grasslands. Millet stalks are rich in nutrients and are excellent fodder for various livestock. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙河套平原糜子丰收
    内蒙古自治区肥沃的河套平原上，一百一十六万多亩糜子开始收割。根据田间观察，平均每亩能收二百一十斤左右，超过一九五四年的丰收水平。有些地区每亩还能收四百斤以上。
    今年河套平原上播种的糜子，比去年增加了十三万多亩，百分之八十以上都采用了“窄行疏播”的方法，大部分施了肥料，经过适时的灌溉以后，一直长得很好。
    糜子是河套平原上各族农民喜爱的主食。农民每年还用糜子制成大批炒米，供给草原上蒙族牧民食用。糜子的秸秆养料丰富，是各种牲畜很好的饲草。　（新华社）
