    Gansu Province is carrying out afforestation survey and design work to coordinate with the Yellow River harnessing project. The Afforestation Survey Team of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry completed the afforestation survey and design for the north and south mountains of Lanzhou at the end of August and has now moved to the Zuli River area.

    The main task of the afforestation survey is to propose soil and water conservation and afforestation design and construction plans based on the collected data. From May to the end of August, the survey team surveyed more than 20,000 hectares of land in the north and south mountains of Lanzhou and studied the local soil properties, the distribution and growth of plants, as well as surface runoff, slope erosion, and flood sediment content. Based on this data, the survey team has initially proposed outline soil and water conservation measures and afforestation opinions. Soon, soil and water conservation and greening projects will be launched in the north and south mountains of Lanzhou.

    Currently, the survey team is working in the Chankou area, which covers more than 6,000 hectares in the Zuli River basin, a tributary of the Yellow River. After the survey and design work in this area is completed in mid-September, the survey team will move to the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Prefecture area in the Jing River basin.

    甘肃配合治黄进行造林规划
    甘肃省为配合根治黄河工程，正进行造林调查设计工作。省农林厅营林调查队在八月底完成兰州南北山的营林调查设计后，现已转赴祖厉河地区。
    营林调查的主要任务是，根据收集的资料提出水土保持、造林的设计方案和施工方案。从五月到八月底，调查队已在兰州南北山勘查了两万多公顷的地区，并研究了当地土壤性质、植物的分布和生长情况，以及地皮迳流、坡地冲刷、洪水含沙量等情况。根据这些资料，调查队初步提出了轮廓性的水土保持措施和造林的意见。不久，兰州南北山就要展开水土保持和绿化童山的工程。
    目前调查队正在黄河支流祖厉河流域六千多公顷面积的巉口地区工作。九月中旬这一地区的调查设计工作完成后，调查队又要转到泾河流域的西海固回族自治州地区。　（新华社）
