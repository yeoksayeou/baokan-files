Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    The Huabei (North China) Elementary Vocational School for Workers in Shijiazhuang wrote to accept the criticism from the "Reader's Letters" page on August 15th. They reviewed their past mistakes of extravagance and waste, and are now determined to correct them. They have already applied to higher-level units to transfer and process the overstocked physics and chemistry instruments and other items.

    The "Reader's Letters" page on August 3rd criticized the erroneous attitude of some units towards demobilized soldiers. The Cadre Department of the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Labor Bureau of Shanxi Province have both written to examine their insufficient understanding of the political significance of settling demobilized soldiers, which led to the mistake of not making demobilized soldiers the first priority for employment. The Cadre Department of the Building Materials Industry Bureau also explained that in the past, they confused transferred cadres with demobilized soldiers, so they could not follow the instructions of national policy to treat them differently in affiliated factories and mines; they have now taken concrete measures to do a good job in settling demobilized soldiers. The Shanxi Provincial Labor Bureau has also compiled a clear list of demobilized soldiers who need employment and will strive to complete the settlement within September and October.

    After the "Reader's Letters" page published the critical letter "Serious Waste of Living Welfare Facilities in the Investigation and Design Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry" on August 15th, the Investigation and Design Bureau wrote back expressing acceptance of the criticism and inspected and dealt with some specific issues.

    The CCP Huanjiang County Committee in Guangxi wrote: After the "Reader's Letters" page published the critical letter "Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives Should Use Funds for Production" on May 22nd, the First District Party Committee went to Weiting Agricultural Producers' Cooperative to conduct education on "running the cooperative diligently and frugally," and mobilized them to revise their original construction plan. In addition, the district also circulated this example throughout the district to educate all cooperatives to learn from the lessons and eliminate waste.

    The Soil Mechanics Laboratory of the Huai River Harnessing Committee wrote to accept the criticism from the "Reader's Letters" page on August 7th. They reviewed their thoughts of greed for enjoyment and their mistakes of not cherishing state property, and have designated a special person to be responsible for handling the inventory of equipment.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate accepted the criticism from the "Reader's Letters" page on June 26th and has sent personnel to assist the People's Court in inspecting and handling the Liu Zhiying counter-revolutionary case. Now, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court has sentenced counter-revolutionary Liu Zhiying to twelve years of imprisonment, Tao Linxuan, who harbored the counter-revolutionary, to three years of imprisonment, and Liang Xingcai to two years of imprisonment.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate also conducted an inspection and handling of the mistake of refusing to accept this case several times. In addition to reporting to higher authorities for approval to give administrative punishments to Tian Bing and Liu Qiguang, who were directly responsible, and ordering other relevant comrades to make profound self-criticisms, it also conducted an in-depth inspection of the phenomena of delays and shirking responsibility in accepting and handling cases, and formulated concrete measures to improve work.

    The Fushun Mining Bureau Office wrote: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" page on August 28th regarding the long-term failure to complete the reconstruction project of the Liushan Inclined Shaft is correct. We have studied the crux of the slow progress of the Liushan Inclined Shaft project and taken measures to strengthen leadership to change the past situation.

    The Fushun Mining Bureau Self-Built Public-Assisted Housing Committee wrote to accept the criticism in the letter "Don't Turn Good Deeds into Bad Deeds" in the "Reader's Letters" page on August 15th. They have accepted this lesson and improved their work. So far, more than 600 housing units have been completed, and more than 2,000 units can be completed by the end of the year; the quality of the housing can be used for twenty to thirty years.
