Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 4th – Sichuan Province, which has already decided to increase the number of agricultural production cooperatives from the current 28,000 to 100,000 before the spring plowing next year, has recently seen a large number of farmers requesting to join cooperatives and establish new ones. In the past month, 24,000 households in Fushun County have requested to join cooperatives; in Pi County, 90% of the poor peasants and 70% of the middle peasants have requested to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. In many areas, farmers have submitted their applications to join the cooperatives to the local CCP branch two or three times. On the Western Sichuan Plain, one can often see groups of individual farmers visiting old cooperatives. Township and village cadres are discussing the upcoming high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, believing that the peasants' enthusiasm for taking the path of cooperation is unprecedented.

In the process of the vast number of peasants requesting to join cooperatives, many middle peasants who previously had a wait-and-see attitude towards the cooperative movement have, under the leadership of the poor peasants, resolutely requested to join. The number of middle peasants requesting to join cooperatives in Huzhu Township, Pi County, has more than doubled compared to last year; Wang Hongxing, a middle peasant from Hexing Township in the same county, who used to call himself "self-sufficient" because he had sufficient cattle, farm tools, and labor, and was unwilling to join the cooperative, is now also resolutely requesting to join. When the working cadres asked him if he wanted to wait a few more years, he replied, "I can't wait any longer! My field and the cooperative's field are only separated by a ridge. The cooperative's crops are excellent, and the yields increase every year. If I wait any longer, I will fall too far behind." At the same time, there are now more and more farmers requesting to join cooperatives in batches and areas. Among the 216 mutual aid groups in Changning County, 212 have recently applied to establish cooperatives; in Fushun County, there are already more than 950 mutual aid groups and joint mutual aid groups whose members all want to join cooperatives.

In light of this situation, all local CCP committees in the province are convening four-level cadre meetings (prefecture, county, district, and township) based on the provincial committee's instructions to develop cooperatives, to formulate specific plans and steps for massively developing cooperatives in their respective regions.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 5th – Many poor peasants in Hunan Province are taking the lead in joining agricultural production cooperatives. Among the more than 67,000 peasant households in the Xiangtan area who have applied to join cooperatives in writing or verbally, poor peasants account for 43.4%.

This year, the early and mid-season rice yields of most of the 13,000 agricultural cooperatives in Hunan Province have increased, with 93% of the cooperatives increasing yields by 10% to 30%. The income of most cooperative members has increased compared to before joining the cooperatives. These cooperatives are distributed in 47% of the province's townships, exerting a good influence on the surrounding farmers. The Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Helin Township, Ningxiang County, increased its double-season rice yield by more than 40,000 jin this year, and the income of each cooperative member increased. After the early rice harvest, more than 200 households in the township, accounting for 64% of the households that had not joined cooperatives, requested to join. On the Dongting Lake Plain after the bumper harvest, the farmers' enthusiasm for joining cooperatives is even higher. According to a survey of typical townships in Yuanjiang and other counties, 90% of the poor peasants are actively requesting to join cooperatives. The Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangjia Township, Xiangyin County, overcame the continuous week-long waterlogging disaster since the beginning of this summer, and also built a new ten-li long anti-waterlogging dike, turning more than 300 mu of barren lakeside land into fertile fields. The cooperative's more than 1,400 mu of early and mid-season rice yielded twice as much as in the bumper year of 1953. After the bumper harvest, nearby farmers all visited the cooperative, expressing their desire to take the socialist road. 70-80% of the households in this township that have not joined cooperatives have already requested to join.

    农业合作化运动的高潮即将到来
    四川和湖南大批农民要求入社
    新华社成都四日电　已经决定在明年春耕前把农业生产合作社由现有的二万八千多个发展到十万个的四川省，最近有大批的农户要求入社和建社。近一个月来，富顺县要求入社的农户已达二万四千户；在郫县，目前已有占全县十分之九的贫农和十分之七的中农要求参加农业生产合作社。许多地区的农户已向当地的中共支部递过两三次入社申请书。在川西平原上，经常能看到成群结队的个体农民到老社去参观和访问。乡、村干部们在谈论着农业合作化运动高潮的到来，他们认为目前农民们走合作化道路的热情是以前任何时候都不能相比的。
    在广大农民要求入社的过程中，许多以前对合作化运动观望徘徊的中农，在贫农带动下转而坚决要求入社。郫县互助乡要求入社的中农比去年增加了一倍多；这个县的合兴乡中农汪洪兴，他因为耕牛、农具和劳动力齐全，过去曾自称“万事不求人”，不愿入社，现在也坚决要求入社了。当工作干部问他是不是还要在外边等几年时，他回答说：“再等不得了！我的田和合作社的田只隔个田埂，合作社的庄稼一片好，收成年年上升。再等，我就掉得太远了。”同时，目前成批、成片要求入社的农民也多起来了。长宁县二百一十六个互助联组中，有二百一十二个组最近申请办社；富顺县已出现了九百五十多个全体要求入社的互助组和互助联组。
    根据这种情况，全省各中共地方委员会正根据省委发展社的指示召开“地、县、区、乡”四级干部会议，订出本区大量发展社的具体计划和步骤。
    新华社长沙五日电　湖南省许多贫农带头参加农业生产合作社。湘潭专区目前以书面或口头申请入社的六万七千多户农民中，贫农占百分之四十三点四。
    今年湖南省一万三千个农业社的早、中稻绝大多数增产，其中有百分之九十三的社增产一成到三成，绝大部分社员的收入都比入社前增加。这些社分布在全省百分之四十七的乡里，对周围农民起着良好影响。宁乡县鹤林乡联盟农业生产合作社今年双季稻增产稻谷四万多斤，每户社员的收入都增加。早稻丰收后，全乡要求入社农户有两百多户，占全乡没有入社农户的百分之六十四。在丰收后的洞庭湖滨平原上，农民要求入社情绪更高。据沅江等县典型乡的调查，有百分之九十的贫农积极要求入社。湘阴县王家乡洞庭围农业生产合作社战胜了今年入夏以来连续一星期的渍水灾害，还新修了一条十里长的防渍堤，把三百多亩湖荒地变成良田。全社一千四百多亩早、中稻比丰收的一九五三年增产一倍。丰收后，附近农民都到社里参观、访问，表示要走社会主义大路。这个乡里没有入社的农户已有百分之七、八十要求入社了。
