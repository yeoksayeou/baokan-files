Comrades:
　　On behalf of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League and all the youth of Mongolia, I extend my heartfelt brotherly congratulations to you and, through you, to all the young friends of China.
　　Dear friends, this National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism is convened in an era when the People’s Republic of China is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have made great achievements in developing the economy and culture of their motherland and are advancing along the road of socialism.
　　The Chinese youth, nurtured and educated by the Chinese Communist Party, have made brilliant contributions to the great cause of socialist construction in their motherland. Every new achievement you make fills us with joy and evokes the admiration and admiration of the Mongolian youth.
　　Dear comrades, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's great program for building socialism is the motivating force for the work and study of Mongolian youth and the banner of their life struggle. Mongolian youth, together with the Mongolian people, are working selflessly for the socialist construction of their motherland. Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have successfully completed the first five-year plan for developing the national economy and are now actively working to complete the second five-year plan ahead of schedule.
　　The 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the 12th Congress of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League are of great significance to the lives of our people. It clearly pointed out the direction of labor and struggle for our youth in the future. On all fronts of developing our country's industry, culture, animal husbandry, etc., new advanced youth production teams, youth shock workers, and rationalization proposers are constantly emerging. In transportation and industrial production, many youth transportation teams striving for "300,000 kilometers of safe driving" and youth production teams striving for "increased production and conservation," "creation of new records," and "production of special quality products" have emerged. In state-owned farms and agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives, the labor competition of young people is also being widely carried out. According to statistics for the first half of 1955 alone, 82 percent of the youth production teams participating in industrial production completed 285 percent of their production quotas. Among them are the youth group led by Oidub, a worker from the joint enterprise, who completed three times the plan, and the advanced youth group led by Demichigjab, a worker from the automobile and machine factory, who completed four times the plan. And the number of such youth groups is increasing day by day.
　　The vast number of young people in our country all take the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League and all the youth of the Soviet Union, as well as the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and all the young men and women workers of China, as examples for their own study in their labor and study.
　　Dear comrades, the friendship between the people of China and Mongolia and the youth of the two countries is solid and unbreakable.
　　The Mongolian youth will further consolidate the friendship with the youth of the great Soviet Union and the youth of China, the bulwark of peace, as well as the progressive youth of the world, and will contribute all their strength to world peace.
　　The Mongolian youth unanimously support and support the just struggle of the Chinese people and Chinese youth to liberate Taiwan, an inseparable part of their motherland's territory.
　　Comrades, the representatives of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League would like to congratulate you, all the comrades of the Chinese Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress who are fighting for socialist construction, and, through you, all the Chinese youth, and wish you greater and more brilliant achievements in your glorious labor in order to realize the resolutions of this congress.
　　Long live the young generation of the hardworking and glorious Chinese people!
　　Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Mongolia and China!
　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the inspirer and organizer of the victory of the Chinese people! (Xinhua News Agency)

    在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上
    蒙古青年代表团团长扎木苏荣的祝词亲爱的同志们：
    我代表蒙古革命青年团和蒙古的全体青年，向你们并通过你们向全中国的青年朋友们致以衷心的兄弟般的祝贺。
    亲爱的朋友们，这次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会是在中华人民共和国日益繁荣富强的时代召开的。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在发展自己祖国经济和文化的事业上获得了巨大的成就，正沿着社会主义的道路向前迈进。
    在中国共产党培养、教育下的中国青年，在自己祖国社会主义建设的伟大事业中作出了辉煌的贡献。你们取得的每一个新的成就都使我们欢欣鼓舞，并引起了蒙古青年的赞扬和钦佩。
    亲爱的同志们，蒙古人民革命党建设社会主义的伟大纲领，是蒙古青年工作、学习的鼓舞力量和生活斗争的旗帜。蒙古青年正和蒙古人民一道为祖国的社会主义建设而奋不顾身地劳动。蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，过去胜利地完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，现在又在为提前完成第二个五年计划而积极地劳动着。
    蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会和蒙古革命青年团第十二次代表大会对我国人民的生活有着重大的意义。它明确地指出了我国青年今后劳动和斗争的方向。在发展我国工业、文化、畜牧业等各个战线上，不断涌现出新的青年先进生产队、青年突击队员和合理化建议者，在交通运输和工业生产方面，出现了许多争取“安全行车三十万公里”的青年运输队，和争取“增产节约”、“创造新纪录”、“生产特等优良产品”的青年生产队，在国营农牧场和农牧业生产合作社里，青年们的劳动竞赛也在广泛地开展着。仅就一九五五年上半年的统计，参加工业生产的青年生产队，就有百分之八十二完成了生产定额的百分之二百八十五。其中有完成计划三倍的联合企业工人奥伊杜布领导的青年小组，有完成计划四倍的汽车和机厂工人德米奇格扎布领导的青年先进小组。而且像这类青年小组的数目还在日益增加着。
    我国广大青年在自己的劳动和学习中，都以苏联列宁共产主义青年团和苏联全体青年以及中国新民主主义青年团和中国全体男女劳动青年作为自己学习的榜样。
    亲爱的同志们，中蒙两国人民及两国青年的友谊是巩固的和牢不可破的。
    蒙古青年将进一步巩固与和平堡垒——伟大的苏联青年和中国青年以及全世界进步青年的友谊，并为世界和平贡献出一切力量。
    蒙古青年一致拥护和支持中国人民和中国青年为解放自己祖国不可分割的领土台湾所进行的正义斗争。
    同志们，蒙古革命青年团的代表们谨向你们，为社会主义建设而斗争的中国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的全体同志，并通过你们向全中国青年祝贺，祝你们为实现这次大会的决议，在光荣的劳动中获得更伟大、更光辉的成就。
    勤劳的、光荣的中国人民的青年一代万岁！
    蒙中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    中国人民胜利的鼓舞者、组织者，中国共产党万岁！（新华社）
