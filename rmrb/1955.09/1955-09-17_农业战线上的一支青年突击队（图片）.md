The members of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative's Youth Shock Brigade are seizing the peak flowering season of peanuts to actively press the peanut vines, aiming to increase peanut production by an extra thirty catties per mu.

The shock brigade members eradicated corn borers in seventy mu of cornfields in one afternoon. This is one of their teams using liquid medicine to irrigate the corn borers.

The Youth Shock Brigade is an active learner and promoter of new agricultural technologies. This is the captain, Jiang Guojun, performing artificial pollination of corn.

    东方红农业生产合作社青年突击队的队员们，抓紧花生盛花期积极进行花生压蔓，要求每亩地超额增产三十斤花生。
    突击队的队员们在一个下午的时间内就消灭了七十亩玉米地里的钻心虫。这是他们一个小队正在用药水灌钻心虫。
    青年突击队是新的农业技术的积极学习者和推行者。这是队长姜国俊正在进行玉米人工辅助授粉。
