    Beautiful Folk Dance
    ——Impressions of the Yugoslav “Kolo” Folk Song and Dance Ensemble Performance
    Wu Xiaobang, Chairman of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association
    On the evening of August 31st, we attended the opening ceremony of the Yugoslav “Kolo” Folk Song and Dance Ensemble's performance in Beijing with sincere respect and joy.
    At this event, the “Kolo” Folk Song and Dance Ensemble performed seventeen dance programs, one folk instrument performance, and one folk song performance. These programs included songs and dances from the various ethnic groups within the five People's Republics of Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. They reflected the simple, hardworking, lively, and brave national character of the Yugoslav people of all ethnic groups, possessing distinct national characteristics that attracted us with great artistic charm from beginning to end.
    The “Kolo” Folk Song and Dance Ensemble's performance left a deep impression on the Chinese audience. From the performance, we deeply felt that the artistic directors, Olga Skovran and Brivoje Putnik, were very serious in their selection of folk dance materials. They approached the ethnic dances of each republic with a very earnest attitude, researching and selecting the most characteristic dance postures and movements to refine and create. They successfully reflected the lives of the Yugoslav people based on the original features of the folk dances. From dances such as the “Dance Near Bilot,” “Montenegrin Dance,” “Dance Near Skopje,” and “Serbian Dance,” we can see how the performance directors used meticulous and careful techniques to refine the various dances distinctly, concisely, clearly, and beautifully. In the dances, they did not separate singing and dancing, but rather combined them. In this way, the refined folk dances still retained their original features, making people feel simple yet beautiful. Although the “Classical Bosnian Dumb Dance” does not involve singing or musical accompaniment, it fully reveals the enthusiasm hidden in the hearts of young people, an enthusiasm that can be expressed without music or song. Regarding the content, such as a young man vigorously shaking a girl's hands to know if his fiancée is healthy and hardworking, artistic director Olga Skovran boldly abandoned the general explanations of dance in the past. Instead, based on the psychological depiction of people and through the internal rhythm and the amplitude of strong and weak movements, she expressed the content of this dance on the basis of the folk dumb dance. This allows for the selection of materials without being limited by the original material, while also developing the form of dumb dance in the original folk dance during the refinement and processing. In the "Montenegrin Dance," the use of the actors' singing to accompany the dance, rather than music, makes the meaning of striving for freedom even more prominent.
    In addition to the seriousness in selecting materials, I also felt that the “Kolo” Folk Song and Dance Ensemble had originality in its adaptation and creation. For example, in the treatment of the “Shota Dance,” based on the representative folk dance of the Albanian ethnic group in Yugoslavia, the artistic directors preserved the beautiful qualities of the original dance in the performance of these two actors, realistically reflecting the people's life and spirit. It is very subtle in depicting the young girl's psychological state of showing her lover that she is considerate in all household chores, and in portraying the lover's impatience. In the performances of the “Vlaski National Competition Dance,” “Katange Dance,” “Bunjevac ‘Kolo’ Dance,” “Doi Dance,” and “Slavonian and Sava River Basin Croatian Folk Dance,” the psychological descriptions of men and women are delicate and vivid, with many contrasting changes in rhythm, and the application is very natural.
    The “Šop National Dance,” “Banat Suburban Competition Dance,” and “Gemit Dance” are male dances in this performance by the ensemble. The actors' techniques are very high. From this, we can see the strictness of the “Kolo” Folk Song and Dance Ensemble's daily rehearsals. This is inseparable from the seriousness and originality of the ensemble's artistic direction. Especially in the “Gemit Dance,” it depicts a fragment of the struggle and life of the Gemit People's Guerrilla, avengers who fought against Turkish rule in the mountains of Macedonia a hundred years ago to liberate their motherland. What makes this dance exciting is that it realistically makes people feel the hardships and intensity of the struggle. The enemy is stubbornly resistant to the end, but the Macedonian people are even more stubborn than the enemy. At the same time, this dance is very complete in terms of material selection and form, and its content deeply touches the Chinese audience, making us also think of our past guerrilla war against Japanese fascism.
    The “Kolo” Folk Song and Dance Ensemble's folk band has very high performing skills. Their cooperation with the dancers is so close that it is seamless.
    Thank you to the Yugoslav artists for such a wonderful performance, allowing us to see the rich and colorful song and dance art of the various ethnic groups of Yugoslavia. We believe that this exchange of culture and art will enhance the understanding and friendship between the people of our two countries. (Attached picture)

### 优美的民间舞蹈——南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团演出观后感

    优美的民间舞蹈
    ——南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团演出观后感
    中国舞蹈艺术研究会主席　吴晓邦
    八月三十一日晚上，我们怀着由衷的敬意和愉快的心情，参加了南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团在北京的演出开幕式。
    在这个晚会上，“科罗”民间歌舞团表演了十七个舞蹈节目、一个民间乐器演奏节目和一个民歌演唱节目。这些节目包括了塞尔维亚、门的内哥罗、马其顿、波斯尼亚及黑塞哥维纳、克罗地亚五个人民共和国内各族人民的歌舞，反映了南斯拉夫各族人民的朴实、勤劳、活泼而又勇敢的民族性格，具有鲜明的民族特色，自始至终以极大的艺术魅力吸引了我们。
    “科罗”民间歌舞团演出的节目给中国观众留下了很深的印象。从演出中，我们深深地感到该团艺术指导奥尔珈·斯科夫兰和布里沃埃·普特尼克两位同志在民间舞蹈的选材上是十分严肃的。他们对每一个共和国的民族舞蹈，都是以十分认真的态度去研究和选择其中最有特点的舞姿和动作来加以整理和创作的。他们根据民间舞蹈的本来面目成功地反映了南斯拉夫人民的生活。从“毕洛特近郊舞”、“门的内哥罗舞”、“斯科阜近郊舞”、“塞尔维亚舞”等舞蹈中，我们可以看出演出指导运用了怎样精心细致的手法，简炼、明确而又美好地将各种舞蹈有区别地整理出来。在舞蹈中，他们并不把唱歌和舞蹈截然分开，而是载歌载舞。这样，经过整理加工的民间舞蹈，仍然不失它们的本来面目，使人感到质朴而又优美。“古典波斯尼亚哑舞”虽然不唱歌也不用乐器伴奏，但完全透露了年青人心里蕴藏着的热情，这种热情不需要音乐或歌唱也能表现出来。像小伙子用力振动姑娘的双手，想知道他的未婚妻是否健康，是否刻苦耐劳这样的内容，艺术指导奥尔珈·斯科夫兰在这里大胆地放弃了过去对舞蹈上一般的解释，而是在民间哑舞的基础上，根据对人们心理的刻划，通过内在的节奏和动作中强弱的振幅面去表现这一舞蹈内容的。这样就可以在选择材料上不致为原来材料所限制，同时在整理加工上又发展了原来民间舞蹈中哑舞的形式。“门的内哥罗舞”内，不用音乐而用演员的歌声伴舞，使舞蹈所表现的争取自由的意义更加突出了。
    除选择材料上的严肃性外，我还感到“科罗”民间歌舞团在改编和创作上是有独创性的。如“莎达舞”的处理，根据南斯拉夫境内阿尔巴尼亚族代表性的民间舞蹈，艺术指导在这两位演员的表现上保留了原有舞蹈中的优美特质，真实地反映了人民的生活和精神面貌。对于年青姑娘向自己的情人显示她从事一切家务中体贴入微的心理状态，和刻划情人的急躁情绪这两方面来说是十分微妙的。在“弗拉希民族竞赛舞”、“卡坦格舞”、“布聂瓦茨‘科罗’舞”、“都依舞”和“斯拉夫及萨瓦河流域克罗地亚民间舞”的表演中，男女的心理描写细致生动，节奏上的对比变化很多，也运用得很自然。
    “寿朴民族舞”、“巴拿特近郊竞赛舞”和“格米特舞”是这次该团演出中的男子舞蹈。演员们的技术很高，从这里，我们可以看出“科罗”民间歌舞团平日排练工作的严格。这和该团艺术指导上的严肃性和独创性也是分不开的。特别在“格米特舞”，它描写一百年以前在马其顿的丛山中进行了人民反对土耳其统治，争取祖国解放战争中的复仇者格米特人民游击队的斗争和生活片断。这个舞蹈令人兴奋的地方，就是使人如实地感到了斗争的坚苦和激烈，敌人是顽强到底的，可是马其顿人民比敌人更顽强。同时，这个舞蹈无论在选材上形式上都是非常完整的，它的内容更是深深地打动了中国的观众，使我们也联想起我们过去反抗日本法西斯的游击战争。
    “科罗”民间歌舞团的民间乐队，演奏技巧很高，他们和舞蹈家的表演配合得如此密切，正是天衣无缝找不到一点空隙。
    感谢南斯拉夫的艺术家们为我们做了这样精采的演出，使我们看到了丰富多采的南斯拉夫各族人民的歌舞艺术。我们相信，这种文化艺术的交流，将增进我们两国人民间的了解和友谊。（附图片）
