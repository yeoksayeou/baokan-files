    Qiqihar's state-owned and joint state-private oil processing factories, responding to the call of the National Oil Conference for increased oil production, launched an inter-factory competition between January and July this year. They also universally learned Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction method and promoted the advanced experience of "iron plate kang?" for reducing moisture and increasing oil yield. This resulted in an average pure oil yield of thirteen jin, one liang, and one qian per hundred jin of soybeans, an increase of one jin, five liang, and five qian compared to the oil yield of soybeans of the same quality during the same period in 1954. Based on the total amount of soybeans processed, the total increase in soybean oil production for these seven months was 340,126 jin, worth over 140,000 yuan in Renminbi.

    齐齐哈尔各油脂工厂大豆出油率普遍提高
    齐齐哈尔市各国营、公私合营油脂加工厂，在今年一月到七月间，响应全国油脂会议关于增产油脂的号召，开展了厂际竞赛，并且普遍学习了李川江先进榨油法，推广了降低水份提高出油率的“铁板炕?”的先进经验，使每百斤大豆的纯油出油率平均达到十三斤一两一钱，较一九五四年同一时期同等质量的大豆出油率多出一斤五两五钱。根据已加工的大豆总量来计算，这七个月共增产豆油三十四万零一百二十六斤，价值人民币十四万余元。
