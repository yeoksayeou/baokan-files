Xinhua News Agency, September 1st – The Second National Congress of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union has determined the basic tasks of the coal miners' union for the future. This basic task is: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to closely connect the union with the masses, extensively and deeply publicize the First Five-Year Plan, further raise the socialist consciousness of coal mine workers, consolidate labor discipline, mobilize the masses of workers to push the labor emulation drive to a new upsurge, so as to accelerate the speed of capital construction, continue restoration and reconstruction work, fully tap the potential of existing mines, ensure the safe and comprehensive completion and over-completion of the coal industry's tasks during the First Five-Year Plan, and prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan, to meet the needs of industry and transportation for coal; and, on the basis of developing production, gradually improve the material and cultural life of coal mine workers.

The congress lasted for eight days and closed on August 30.

During the congress, the delegates listened to the work report of Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the First National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union, and the explanations of Zhao Yuxiang and Chen Gengfu, Vice-Chairmen, on the draft resolutions on organizational issues and the report on financial work. After heated discussions, the congress unanimously agreed to these reports and explanations and adopted corresponding resolutions.

The congress believes that in the past four years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the coal miners' union organizations at all levels have closely cooperated with the administration, mobilized coal mine workers to carry out labor emulation drives, actively implemented the policy of safe production, promoted new coal mining methods, improved the degree of mechanization, and improved working conditions, thus enabling the labor productivity of state-owned coal mines in 1954 to increase by 1.24 times compared with 1949, and the national output of raw coal in 1954 reached 2.6 times that of 1949, ensuring the needs of industrial production, transportation, and the people of the whole country. However, in order to ensure the completion and over-completion of the coal industry's tasks during the First Five-Year Plan, the coal miners' union must further improve its work, especially to actively mobilize the masses of workers to overcome the formalism in the labor emulation drive. Labor emulation should be organized realistically based on the main problems existing in the current coal industry production and capital construction, such as the imbalance of the three main links of geology, tunneling, and coal mining in production, poor regular cyclical operations, low utilization rate of mechanical equipment, many accidents, large waste, poor quality, and slow engineering progress, low quality, high cost, large waste, and many accidents in capital construction. It is necessary to strengthen the specific organization of labor emulation, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and push the labor emulation drive to a new upsurge, so as to increase production, practice thrift, and over-fulfill the national plan.

The congress pointed out the urgent significance of vigorously organizing coal mine workers to improve technology, enhance technology, learn and master new technologies in the labor emulation drive. Due to the rapid development of the coal industry, the continuous improvement of the degree of mechanization of existing mines, and the successive commissioning of new modern mines, rapidly improving the cultural and technical level of coal mine workers has become an important task of the coal miners' union at present.

The congress made an in-depth examination of the work of the coal miners' union organizations at all levels in recent years in ensuring safe production, caring for the lives of the workers, strengthening union construction, and improving leadership style, with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

The congress also pointed out that all coal mine workers must raise their revolutionary vigilance and thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Trade Union of the People's Republic of China, the congress elected Jin Zhifu, Xu Daben, and 45 others on its final day to form the Second National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union, and also elected the Second Finance Review Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union.

    中国煤矿工会第二届全国代表大会闭幕
    新华社一日讯　中国煤矿工会第二届全国代表大会确定了煤矿工会今后的基本任务。这个基本任务是：在中国共产党的领导下，密切工会与群众的联系，广泛深入地宣传第一个五年计划，进一步提高煤矿职工的社会主义觉悟，巩固劳动纪律，发动职工群众把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨，以加快基本建设速度，继续进行恢复、改建工作，充分发挥现有矿井的潜力，保证安全地全面地完成并超额完成第一个五年计划期间煤炭工业的任务，并为第二个五年计划做好准备工作，以满足工业和运输业对于煤炭的需要；并在发展生产的基础上逐步地改善煤矿职工的物质和文化生活。
    这次大会共进行了八天，已在八月三十日闭幕。
    在大会期间，代表们听取了中国煤矿工会第一届全国委员会主席金直夫、副主席赵玉祥、陈耕夫分别所作的中国煤矿工会工作报告、关于组织问题的几项决议草案的说明和关于财务工作的报告。经过热烈的讨论以后，大会一致同意这些报告和说明，并通过了相应的决议。
    大会认为，中国煤矿工会各级组织四年来在中国共产党的领导下，密切配合行政，发动煤矿职工开展劳动竞赛，积极贯彻安全生产方针，推行了新采煤法，提高了机械化程度，改善了劳动条件，从而使国营煤矿一九五四年的劳动生产率比一九四九年提高了一点二四倍，全国原煤产量在一九五四年达到了一九四九年的二点六倍，保证了工业生产、交通运输和全国人民的需要。但是，为了保证完成和超额完成第一个五年计划期间煤炭工业的任务，煤矿工会还必须进一步改进和提高自己的工作，特别是要积极地发动职工群众克服劳动竞赛中的形式主义的缺点。应当根据当前煤炭工业生产和基本建设中存在的主要问题，如生产方面的地质、掘进和采煤三个主要环节不平衡，正规循环作业不好，机械设备利用率低，事故多，浪费大，质量不好，以及基本建设方面的工程进度慢、质量低、成本高、浪费大、事故多等问题，来实事求是地组织劳动竞赛，并加强对劳动竞赛的具体组织工作，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，把劳动竞赛推向新的高涨，以增加生产，厉行节约，超额完成国家计划。
    大会指出了在劳动竞赛中大力组织煤矿职工改进技术、提高技术、学习和掌握新技术的迫切意义。由于煤炭工业的迅速发展，现有矿井生产机械化程度的不断提高，新建的新型矿井的陆续投入生产，尽速提高煤矿职工的文化、技术水平已成为煤矿工会当前重要的任务。
    大会对几年来煤矿工会各级组织在保证安全生产、关心职工群众生活、加强工会建设和改进领导作风等方面的工作，以批评与自我批评的精神作了深入的检查。
    大会还指出，全体煤矿职工必须提高革命警惕性，彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    这次大会根据中华人民共和国工会章程的规定，在它的最后一天选举金直夫、徐达本等四十五人组成了中国煤矿工会第二届全国委员会，并选出了中国煤矿工会第二届经费审查委员会。
