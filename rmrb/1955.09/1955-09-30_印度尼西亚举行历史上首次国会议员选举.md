Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 29th: Indonesia held its first-ever parliamentary elections on the 29th. According to the Indonesian News Agency, voters in 172 of the 208 voting districts across Indonesia cast their ballots on the 29th. These voting districts encompass almost all of Indonesia's densely populated areas. Voting began at 8:00 AM and generally concluded at 2:00 PM on the same day.

Thirty-six other voting districts were unable to hold elections on schedule due to threats from the "Darul Islam" rebel groups or due to transportation difficulties. These areas will hold elections before November 29th.

In the capital, Jakarta, many voters went to approximately 1,100 polling stations distributed throughout the city early in the morning to vote. Indonesian President Sukarno also arrived at a polling station near Independence Square before voting began. When voting commenced, he was invited to cast the first vote. Many foreign diplomatic officials were present to observe. After voting, Sukarno gave a brief speech.

Voters were required to bring the notification letters issued to them by the election committee a few days before the voting to the polling stations and vote according to the prescribed procedures. Voters first handed the notification letter to the members of the polling station's voting committee for inspection, received an election certificate, and then used the election certificate to collect their ballots. These ballots were about the size of a regular newspaper. In Jakarta, the ballots were printed with the symbols of dozens of political parties and organizations, or individuals, participating in the election.

After receiving the ballots, voters went to booths enclosed by bamboo mats to select candidates, punching a hole in a symbol or writing the candidate's name in a blank space.

According to Information Minister Makmur, the ballots will be counted publicly at each polling station, then wrapped up and sent to the election committee for a second count. He said that the election results will not be officially announced until the election committee has re-counted the ballots, even in Jakarta.

On December 15th, Indonesia will also hold another vote to elect 520 members of the Constituent Assembly, which will draft the constitution of the Republic of Indonesia and elect the President and Vice President of the Republic.

    印度尼西亚举行历史上首次国会议员选举
    新华社雅加达二十九日电　印度尼西亚二十九日举行了历史上第一次的国会议员选举。据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，在全印度尼西亚二百零八个投票区中，有一百七十二个投票区的选民在二十九日举行投票。这些投票区差不多包括印度尼西亚所有人口稠密的地区。投票是从上午八时开始的，一般到当天十四时截止。
    还有三十六个投票区因为受到“回教国运动”匪帮活动的威胁，或者因为交通困难等原因，不能按期进行投票。这些地区将在十一月二十九日以前举行选举。
    在首都雅加达，许多选民一早就到分布在全市的大约一千一百个投票站去投票。印度尼西亚总统苏加诺也在投票开始以前到了独立广场附近的一个投票站。当投票开始时，他被邀请投第一票。许多外国外交官员在旁观看。在投票后，苏加诺作了一个简短的演讲。
    选民们在投票时要携带着选举委员会在投票以前几天发给他们的通知书到投票站，按照规定的手续投票。选民们先将通知书交给投票站的投票委员会的委员检查，领取选举证，然后凭选举证领取选票。这些选票有一般报纸那么大。在雅加达，选票上印有几十个有代表参加竞选的政党和团体的或个人的标志。
    选民们在领到选票后就到一些用竹席围着的棚子去挑选候选人，在一个标志上戳一个洞，或者是在空白处写上候选人的名字。
    据情报部长马克慕尔说，选票将在每一个投票站当众点清，然后把它们包扎起来送往选举委员会再清点一次。他说，在选举委员会再清点选票以前，将不正式宣布选举结果，即使在雅加达也是如此。
    在十二月十五日，印度尼西亚还将举行另一次投票选举五百二十个制宪议会的议员，制宪议会将制定印度尼西亚共和国的宪法以及选举共和国的总统和副总统。
