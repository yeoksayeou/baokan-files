Make a Good Job of Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities

	Absolutely No Violation of Grain Supply Policies Allowed
	Lí Zhāng
	The Sixth Dormitory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a small-scale exhibition on food waste on August 12th. The exhibits included steamed rolls, steamed buns, stuffed buns, and rice... all covered in white and green mold; there were more than 90 jin in total, collected within two days. Some veteran workers were heartbroken when they saw it, saying, "It's simply shameful!" Some workers' families were also heartbroken and said, "These people are too cruel!"
	Everyone knows that wasting food is squandering the fruits of farmers' labor and ruining the country's most important materials; anyone who wastes food should feel ashamed, especially after vigorously promoting food conservation.
	The leadership should also be held responsible for this waste. This is because they have not done a good job of publicizing food conservation to the workers, and they have not conscientiously implemented the state's grain supply policy. Lǚ Péngxiáng, a worker in the ironmaking workshop, criticized, "Since the promotion of food conservation, only the on-site union chairman has spoken to us about it once, and it was only mentioned in passing during a discussion of the work plan."
	Some leaders do not pay attention to the grain issue because they think that saving grain is a trivial matter, and they are doing big things. However, the country's grain work is increasingly on the right track, and grain supply methods are becoming increasingly strict. The grain allocated to some agencies, organizations, and schools is now subject to rationing. Under these circumstances, the leaders of these units should have taken responsibility, leading the catering management personnel to work hard on careful calculation, improved management, and the elimination of waste, so that the problem could be truly solved. However, there are some people who continue to make mistakes and even instruct or condone catering management personnel to take some extremely wrong measures, such as falsely reporting the number of people, raising the supply level, and purchasing potatoes in the countryside, to make up for the "shortfall" in grain. In this way, they embark on a path of breaking the law.
	The reason why these people dare to break the law is because they think they are personnel of agencies, organizations, and schools, and are "public servants," so there is probably nothing wrong with doing so. In fact, they have completely reversed the facts. Members of agencies, organizations, schools, factories, and cooperatives are all organized personnel and are the advanced part of urban residents; they should become models of saving grain and implementing the state's grain policy. Don't these people in these units, especially the leaders among them, really understand this principle? If they understand this principle and yet brazenly act in the opposite direction, isn't that knowingly violating the law and should be punished more severely? Where would "nothing wrong" come from?
	Liú Róngjiàn, the director of the Wuchang First Cake and Noodle Cooperative, single-mindedly pursued profits, falsely reported the amount of grain used in various ways, and accumulated a large amount of grain for a long time; after the problem was discovered, he wanted to cover up his mistakes and manufactured a large number of thin noodles to sell to private merchants, condoning private merchants in speculation. In order to enforce Party discipline, the Jianghan District Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to remove him from his Party work post and recommend that the administration demote him. I believe that people who seriously violate the state's grain policy, regardless of their responsibilities, should be given the punishment they deserve in addition to education. We absolutely will not allow knowingly breaking the law.

### 决不允许违反粮食供应政策

    决不允许违反粮食供应政策
    黎璋
    石景山钢铁厂第六宿舍在八月十二日举办了一个小型的浪费粮食展览会，展览品有花卷、馒头、包子、米饭……都长了白毛和绿毛；共有九十多斤，是在两天以内搜集起来的。有些老工人看了很心痛，说：“简直是可耻！”有些工人家属看了也很心痛地说：“这些人真是太忍心了！”
    谁都知道，浪费粮食就是挥霍农民的劳动成果，糟蹋国家最重要的物资；谁浪费粮食谁就应该感到可耻，特别是在大张旗鼓地宣传节约粮食以后。
    对于这种浪费现象，领导方面也要负责。这是因为他们没有很好地对工人进行节约粮食的宣传，没有认真贯彻国家的粮食供应政策。炼铁车间工人逯鹏翔批评道：“自从提倡节约粮食以来，只有现场工会主席给我们讲过一次，还是在讨论作业计划时捎带着讲的。”
    某些领导人员不注意粮食问题，是因为他们觉得节约粮食是小事，而他们是干大事的。但是，国家的粮食工作日益走上正轨，粮食供应办法日渐严格起来，某些机关、团体、学校分得的粮食，现在是要定量了。在这种情况下，这些单位的领导人员原该负起责任，领导管理伙食的人员，从精打细算、改进管理、杜绝浪费方面下功夫，这样，问题就真正解决了。可是，偏偏有那么些人，他们继续一错再错，竟授意或默许伙食管理人员，采取一些极端错误的办法，例如：虚报名额，提高供应等别，下乡采购土豆等等，来弥补粮食的“差额”。这样，他们就走上了犯法的道路。
    这些人所以敢于犯法，是因为他们觉得自己是机关、团体、学校的人员，是“公家人”，这样作了，大概没有什么。其实，他们完全把事实弄颠倒了。机关、团体、学校、工厂、合作社中的成员都是有组织的人员，是城镇居民中的先进部分；他们应该成为节约粮食、执行国家粮食政策的模范。这些单位的人员，特别是其中的领导人员，难道真不懂得这种道理吗？如果懂得这种道理，而又悍然不顾一切地朝着相反的方向作，难道不是知法犯法，应该罪加一等吗？哪里还会“没有什么”呢？
    武昌第一糕面合作社主任刘荣鉴单纯追求利润，用各种方法虚报用粮数量，长期大量积压粮食；问题被发现后，他想掩盖错误，大量制造水切面售给私商，纵容私商投机取巧。中共江汉区委为了严肃党纪，已决定撤销他的党内工作职务，并建议行政予以降职处分。我认为，对于严重违反国家粮食政策的人，不管他负什么责任，除了教育以外，还该及时给以应得的处分。我们决不允许知法犯法。
