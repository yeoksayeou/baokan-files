    The Glorious Decade of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

    Today is a glorious festival for the Vietnamese people. Ten years ago, on September 2, 1945, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, solemnly declared Vietnam's independence to the world on behalf of more than 20 million Vietnamese people. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam was born in Southeast Asia, and the Vietnamese people's long-standing desire to break away from imperialist rule was realized. Today, all friends of the Vietnamese people join them in celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of this independent and free country, and in celebrating the glorious achievements of the Vietnamese people's struggle for peace, unification, independence, and democracy over the past decade.

    The history of the Vietnamese people is filled with heroic struggles against colonialist aggression and for national independence and freedom. Ever since French colonialists invaded Vietnamese territory more than ninety years ago, the flames of the national liberation struggle have been ignited in the Vietnamese people. During World War II, the Vietnamese people waged a desperate struggle against the Japanese fascist invaders. Ten years ago, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people achieved the historic victory of the "August Revolution," overthrew colonial rule, gained national independence, established a democratic government throughout the country, held free and universal elections, passed a constitution, and established a central government. The Vietnamese people have since embarked on the road of democratic development.

    People who have achieved victory in the struggle for a just cause are people who know how to defend their victorious gains. However, colonialist aggressors are always unwilling to see this fact, let alone admit it. At the end of World War II, just as the Vietnamese people were preparing to begin a new life, the French colonialists launched a full-scale war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in an attempt to reconquer Vietnam. In order to defend peace and national independence, the Vietnamese people bravely resisted the aggression of the French colonialists. While engaging in armed struggle, the Vietnamese people established anti-Japanese base areas in North Vietnam under extremely difficult conditions, consolidated the people's regime, strengthened the people's armed forces, began the land reform movement, and developed the economy and culture. The Vietnamese people persisted in eight years of heroic resistance, thwarting the French colonialists' attempt to reconquer Vietnam, and laying the foundation for Vietnam's unification, independence, and peace in Indochina. Due to the victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people and the efforts of peace-loving countries, an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina was finally reached at the Geneva Conference in 1954. This victory of the Vietnamese people once again proves that the people who fight for peace and the independence and freedom of their motherland are forever invincible. It has written a glorious page in the history of the liberation movement of colonial peoples.

    Since the restoration of peace, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made remarkable achievements in restoring the national economy and carrying out peaceful construction. The vigorous land reform movement currently underway in North Vietnam has made millions of peasants the true masters of the land. As a result, the enthusiasm of farmers in production has been increased a hundredfold, and agricultural production in North Vietnam has further increased. This year's summer harvest alone has increased by half compared to last year. Currently, the people of North Vietnam are fighting to restore grain production to pre-war levels in 1955-1956. Many industries and handicrafts are actively restoring and expanding production. The achievements in restoring transportation are also significant. The Hanoi-Munankuan Railway has been repaired and opened to traffic, most of the highways in North Vietnam have been opened to traffic, and inland waterway transportation has been fully restored. The victories won by the Vietnamese people on the economic front have further consolidated the foundation for the Vietnamese people to strive for unification and complete independence.

    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam adheres to a peaceful foreign policy and contributes its strength to promoting the cause of peace and cooperation in Asia and the world, and to further easing tensions in the Far East and the world. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made unremitting efforts to maintain and implement the Geneva Accords. It has consistently and faithfully fulfilled the Geneva Armistice Agreement on the cessation of hostilities, withdrawal and transfer of troops, and other issues. The work of withdrawing and transferring troops was completed on May 16, 1955, which created the necessary conditions for the unification of Vietnam through free elections. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly sent notes to the South Vietnamese authorities on June 6 and July 19, requesting that, in accordance with the Geneva Armistice Agreement, the North and South Vietnamese authorities conduct consultations from July 20 to discuss the holding of free elections under the supervision of the International Commission in July 1956 to achieve the unification of Vietnam. This fully demonstrates the sincerity and determination of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to fully implement the Geneva Accords.

    However, the implementation of the Geneva Accords has been constantly obstructed and undermined. For more than a year, through a series of activities that violate the Geneva Accords, including the way of signing the so-called military assistance agreement, the United States has tried to drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, making the situation in Southeast Asia constantly seriously uneasy. The procedures stipulated in the Geneva Accords for preparing for the Vietnamese general election are being seriously undermined. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique, fearing being driven off the stage by the Vietnamese people in a free general election, and in order to persist in the division of Vietnam, openly refused to implement the Geneva Accords and consult on general elections. It also attacked the International Commission, implemented a reign of terror in South Vietnam, suppressed democratic freedoms, illegally arrested and massacred patriotic people, and tried its best to obstruct the realization of peaceful unification of Vietnam. On August 30, US Secretary of State Dulles once again gave open encouragement to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's activities in violating the Geneva Accords and refusing to consult on general elections, believing that "conditions are not yet suitable for holding free elections" in Vietnam. This open violation of international agreements by the United States is fundamentally incompatible with its statement at the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference that it is also willing to ease international tensions.

    Vietnam is an indivisible whole. According to the Geneva Accords, the unification of Vietnam through free elections is the desire of all the Vietnamese people and peace-loving people around the world, and it is also the sacred national right of the Vietnamese people. Faced with the current situation, the countries concerned in the Geneva Conference have the responsibility to conduct consultations as soon as possible in order to prevent the destruction of the Geneva Accords and to ensure that this solemn agreement can be fully implemented.

    The people of China and Vietnam have a long tradition of friendship. In the nearly one hundred years of struggle against colonialist aggression and for national liberation, the people of China and Vietnam have sympathized with and supported each other. As President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said: "We are not only friendly neighbors, but also brothers in adversity." The Chinese people rejoice in every victory of the Vietnamese people in the national liberation war. The Chinese people deeply understand the great significance of the Vietnamese people's struggle in defending our peaceful construction. In recent years, the people of China and Vietnam have been developing economic and cultural ties on the basis of friendly cooperation. Not long ago, the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh visited our country, which further promoted the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Vietnam. In the joint communique of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments, the two countries reiterated their desire to fully implement the Geneva Accords, maintain peace in Asia and the world, and further promote political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese people will give full support to the Vietnamese people's peaceful construction and their struggle to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete independence and democracy. We wish the Vietnamese people new victories in this struggle. We wish the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam will grow and be consolidated day by day.

### 越南民主共和国光辉的十年

    越南民主共和国光辉的十年
    今天是越南人民的光荣节日。十年前，一九四五年九月二日，越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席代表两千多万越南人民，向全世界庄严地宣布了越南的独立。越南民主共和国在东南亚诞生了，越南人民多少年来摆脱帝国主义统治的愿望实现了。今天，越南人民的一切友人都同越南人民一起欢庆这个独立自由的国家诞生的十周年，欢庆十年来越南人民争取和平、统一、独立和民主的斗争的光辉成就。
    越南人民的历史中充满了反对殖民主义侵略、争取民族独立自由的英勇斗争。自从九十多年前法国殖民者侵入越南领土以后，越南人民就燃起了民族解放斗争的火焰。在第二次世界大战期间，越南人民对日本法西斯侵略者展开了殊死的斗争。十年前，越南人民在越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党的领导下，取得了“八月革命”的历史性胜利，推翻了殖民统治，获得了民族独立，在全国范围内建立了民主政权，举行了自由普选，通过了宪法并成立了中央政府。越南人民从此开始走上民主发展的道路。
    在为正义事业而进行的斗争中取得了胜利的人民，是知道怎样保卫自己的胜利果实的人民。但是，殖民主义侵略者总是不愿意看到这个事实，更不愿承认这个事实。第二次世界大战结束，正当越南人民准备开始建设新生活的时候，法国殖民者就对越南民主共和国重新发动了全面的侵略战争，企图重新征服越南。为了保卫和平和民族独立，越南人民奋不顾身抗击法国殖民者的侵略。在武装斗争的同时，越南人民在极端艰苦的环境中在北越建立了抗战根据地，巩固了人民政权，壮大了人民武装，开始进行土地改革运动并发展了经济和文化。越南人民坚持八年的英勇抗战，挫败了法国殖民者妄想重新征服越南的计划，为越南的统一、独立和印度支那的和平奠定了基础。由于越南人民的胜利斗争和爱好和平国家的努力，在一九五四年日内瓦会议上，终于达成恢复印度支那的和平的协议。越南人民的这个胜利再一次证明了为和平和祖国独立自由而斗争的人民是永远不可战胜的。它在殖民地人民的解放运动史上写下了光荣的一页。
    和平恢复以后，越南民主共和国在恢复国民经济、进行和平建设方面已取得了显著的成就。正在越南北方进行的轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，已使千百万农民成了土地的真正主人。因此，农民生产的积极性百倍地加强了，越南北方的农业生产进一步提高了。今年的夏收就比去年增加一半。目前越南北方人民正为使粮食生产在一九五五—一九五六年恢复战前水平进行斗争。许多工业和手工业正在积极恢复和扩大生产。恢复交通运输方面的成绩也很显著。河内—睦南关铁路已修复通车，越南北方大部分公路已通车，内河航运已全部恢复。越南人民在经济战线上获得的胜利，进一步巩固了越南人民争取实现统一和完全独立的基础。
    越南民主共和国坚持和平外交政策，为促进亚洲和世界和平与合作的事业，为进一步缓和远东和世界紧张局势而贡献自己的力量。越南民主共和国为维护和贯彻日内瓦协议进行了不懈的斗争。在停火、撤退和转移军队以及其他各项问题上，它一贯地忠实履行日内瓦停战协定。关于军队的撤退和转移工作已于一九五五年五月十六日完成，这就为通过自由普选以实现越南统一造成了必要条件。因此，越南民主共和国在六月六日和七月十九日一再照会南越当局，要求按照日内瓦停战协定，从七月二十日起，越南南北双方当局进行协商，讨论在一九五六年七月在国际委员会的监督下举行自由普选以实现越南统一的问题。这充分表现了越南民主共和国彻底实现日内瓦协议的诚意和决心。
    然而日内瓦协议的实施却一直遭受阻挠和破坏。一年多以来，经过一系列违反日内瓦协议的活动，包括签订所谓军事援助协定的方式在内，美国力图把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拉进东南亚侵略集团，使东南亚的局势经常严重不安。日内瓦协议规定的准备越南普选的程序正在受到严重破坏。吴庭艳集团为了害怕在自由普选中被越南人民赶下台，为了坚持分裂越南，竟公然拒绝履行日内瓦协议，协商普选。它并且袭击国际委员会，在越南南方实行恐怖统治，镇压民主自由，非法逮捕和屠杀爱国人民，极力阻挠越南和平统一的实现。八月三十日，美国国务卿杜勒斯对吴庭艳集团违反日内瓦协议，拒绝协商普选的活动再度给以公开的鼓励，认为在越南“条件还不适于举行自由选举”。美国这种对于国际协议的公然违反的行为，是同它在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上所作的它也愿意缓和国际紧张局势的表示根本不相容的。
    越南是一个不可分割的整体，按照日内瓦协议，通过自由普选来实现越南的统一是全体越南人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，也是越南人民神圣的民族权利。面对着当前的局势，日内瓦会议有关国家有责任早日进行协商，以便阻止对日内瓦议协的破坏行为，使这个庄严的协议得以彻底实现。
    中越两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊。在近百年来的反对殖民主义侵略和争取民族解放的斗争中，中越两国人民彼此同情，互相支持。正如越南民主共和国胡志明主席所说的：“我们不但是友好邻邦，同时也是患难的兄弟。”中国人民欢呼越南人民在民族解放战争中的每一个胜利。中国人民深切了解越南人民的斗争在保卫我国和平建设方面的重大意义。近几年来，中越两国人民在友好合作的基础上发展着经济和文化方面的联系。不久前，以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团来我国访问，进一步促进了中越两国人民的兄弟般的友谊。在中越两国政府的联合公报中，重申了两国彻底实现日内瓦协议、维护亚洲和世界和平以及进一步促进两国政治、经济和文化合作的愿望。中国人民对越南人民的和平建设和巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主的斗争将予以全力支持。祝越南人民在这一斗争中获得新的胜利。祝中越两国人民的友谊日益发展和巩固。
