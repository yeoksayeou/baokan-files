The nationwide autumn harvest is about to begin. Chinese farmers will be harvesting the fruits of their year-long hard work on fifteen hundred million mu of land. This year, China will achieve a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oilseeds, sugar crops, tobacco, hemp, and other crops. This is a great joyous event in China's agricultural production and a great joyous event in China's national economic development plan. The task for farmers across the country now is to strive to increase yields, ensure a bumper harvest, and strive to overfulfill this year's agricultural production increase plan.

Improving harvesting methods and practicing careful harvesting and meticulous threshing are important measures to ensure a bumper harvest; farmers in many areas have such experience. This year, China's autumn harvest grain crops cover approximately thirteen to fourteen hundred million mu. If each mu yields an average of five more jin during the harvesting process, the country will harvest an additional six to seven billion jin. This amount of grain is enough to feed more than ten million people for a year, and if used for export, it can be exchanged for four to five thousand tractors. The saying "many grains make a heap" is precisely this principle. Since 1953, various regions in China have vigorously promoted careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and have indeed achieved great results. However, this does not mean that all farmers understand the significance of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and can consciously do so. Last year, farmers in Wenyang Township, Pinghe County, Fujian Province, practiced careful harvesting and meticulous threshing during the summer harvest, and the thirty-two mutual aid teams in the township harvested an additional 15,000 jin of rice; however, this year, the township's early rice, covering more than 2,000 mu, lost approximately 7,000 jin of rice due to rough harvesting. This shows that even in areas where careful harvesting and meticulous threshing have been advocated and implemented in the past, it is still wrong to relax leadership now. Farmers cherish their labor fruits very much and have also accumulated many good harvesting experiences. However, many farmers still use some crude harvesting methods, which are not easy to change in a short time. Farmers are prone to neglecting careful harvesting and meticulous threshing in bumper harvest years, and rural Party and government leading organs must pay special attention to preventing this phenomenon.

Autumn harvest crops include grain, cotton, oilseeds, sugar crops, and other crops, all of which should be harvested carefully and threshed meticulously. In the past, some areas only paid attention to grain crops and relaxed on other crops, which was very wrong. Taking cotton as an example, careful and timely picking can reduce losses and increase yields. Farmers in cotton-producing areas such as Hebei and Hubei provinces have experience in carefully picking cotton to reduce losses, which should be promoted. Improving the method of harvesting sugarcane (implementing low cutting and pulling up the last year's stubble) can increase the yield of sugarcane by 250 jin to 800 jin per mu. If this harvesting method is fully promoted in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, and other provinces, it can increase sugarcane production by 10 million dan per year, equivalent to the output of 200,000 mu of sugarcane fields.

When harvesting grain, oilseeds, and other crops, we must not only strive to increase the yield of seeds and grains, but also strive to increase the yield of stalks, vines, and leaves. The stalks, vines, and leaves of many crops are feed for draught animals, and the vines and leaves of sweet potatoes and peanuts and the cobs of corn are good feed for pigs. Harvesting more of these products plays a significant role in solving the problem of feed shortage. This year, many regions have expanded the planting area of sweet potatoes, corn, and peanuts, and the by-products of these crops will be more than in previous years. Attention should be paid to collecting and storing them for use as livestock feed.

In order to increase yields, harvesting methods must be improved. Some young farmers are not skilled in harvesting techniques, and technical instruction should be strengthened for them. During the summer harvest this year, farmers in many areas used the method of masters teaching apprentices to impart harvesting techniques, which had a good effect and should be promoted. During the autumn harvest last year and the summer harvest this year, some members of agricultural cooperatives only focused on earning work points and neglected the quality of harvesting, scattering a lot of grain. Collectivism education should be strengthened for such people. At the same time, the work point system of agricultural cooperatives should also be improved, and careful harvesting and meticulous threshing should be included as one of the standards for calculating work points. This year, many regions have promoted a large number of threshing machines. Technical extension stations should strengthen technical instruction, give full play to the role of threshing machines, improve threshing efficiency, and reduce grain scattering. During the summer harvest this year, farmers in many areas invented new harvesting tools and improved old harvesting tools, which played a great role in improving harvesting efficiency and reducing grain scattering, and should be promoted in the autumn harvest.

Autumn harvest work includes many links such as harvesting, carrying, threshing, drying, and storing. Giving full attention to each link can maximize the harvest. In the past, many regions often neglected drying and storage, resulting in a decline in the quality of grain and cotton, and even mold and spoilage. This year, strict prevention is necessary. This year, the planting area of tuber crops has increased significantly, and tubers are not easy to store and manage. This problem should be resolved as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary losses.

The existing six hundred thousand agricultural production cooperatives should strive to play an exemplary role in the autumn harvest work, working hard to harvest carefully and thresh meticulously to ensure a bumper harvest.

On a nationwide scale, there is still some time before the harvest season, which can be used to do a good job in protecting the harvest. The grain and other crops in many areas are still in the later stages of growth. Strengthening field management of these crops still has a certain effect on increasing yields. Implementing measures to promote early maturity of cotton can improve the yield and quality of cotton. Preventing pests in late rice and preventing drought and lodging can ensure increased production of late rice. Regardless of whether it is in the south or the north, all kinds of crops may still suffer from natural disasters before harvesting. Attention must be paid to drought prevention, pest control, wind prevention, and frost prevention. Some rural workers see a bumper harvest in sight and are about to harvest, thus relaxing their leadership in protecting the harvest, which is wrong. A bumper harvest in sight does not mean that a bumper harvest has already been achieved. There are many lessons to be learned from crop disasters and reduced yields due to lack of prevention before harvesting. We must remember these lessons and never allow the fruits of a year's hard work to be damaged.

Security work before and during the autumn harvest must be especially strengthened. During the summer harvest this year, some areas experienced incidents of counter-revolutionaries burning and stealing grain from agricultural cooperatives. Currently, some areas have also discovered counter-revolutionaries stealing and cutting crops. All rural workers and the masses of farmers should be vigilant and not allow any sabotage conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries to succeed.

### 实行精收细打，保证丰产丰收

    实行精收细打，保证丰产丰收
    全国规模的秋收就要开始。我国的农民将在十五亿亩田地上，陆续收获一年来辛勤劳动的果实。今年我国的粮食、棉花、油料、糖料、烟、麻等作物都将获得丰收，这是我国农业生产上的一件大喜事，也是我国发展国民经济计划中的一件大喜事。现在全国农民的任务，就是努力提高收获量，确保丰产丰收，争取超额完成今年的农业增产计划。
    改进收获方法，实行精收细打，是保证丰收的重要措施；许多地区的农民都有这样的经验。我国今年的秋收粮食作物约有十三、四亿亩，如果每亩在收获过程中平均多收五斤，全国就能多收六、七十亿斤。这批粮食足够一千多万人吃一年，如果用以出口，就可以换回四、五万部拖拉机。所谓积少成多，正是这个道理。我国各地一九五三年以来大力提倡精收细打，确实获得很大的成绩。但是，这并不等于所有农民都懂得了精收细打的意义，都能自觉地这样作了。福建省平和县文洋乡农民在去年夏收时实行精收细打，全乡三十二个互助组多收获一万五千斤稻谷；但今年全乡早稻二千多亩，又因收割粗糙损失稻谷约七千斤。这说明即使过去曾经提倡和实行精收细打的地区，现在放松领导仍然是不对的。农民非常珍惜自己的劳动果实，也积累了很多良好的收获经验。但是，许多农民仍然沿用一些粗放的收获方法，一时还很不容易改变过来。农民们在丰收年月容易忽视精收细打，农村党政领导机关要特别注意防止这种现象。
    秋收作物包括粮食、棉花、油料、糖料等作物，都应该实行精收细打。有些地区过去只注意粮食作物，而放松其他作物，这是很不对的。以棉花来说，精细、适时地进行收摘，就可以减少损失，提高产量。河北、湖北等省棉区的农民，都有精细收摘棉花减少损失的经验，应该加以推广。改进收获甘蔗的方法（实行低砍和拔收最后一年的宿根），每亩可增收甘蔗二百五十斤到八百斤。如果在广东、广西、福建、四川等省全面推广这种收获方法，一年可增产甘蔗一千万担，相当二十万亩甘蔗田的产量。
    收获粮食、油料等作物，不仅要努力提高籽实的收获量，而且要努力提高秸秆、藤蔓和叶子的收获量。许多作物的秸秆、藤蔓和叶子是耕畜的饲料，甘薯、花生的藤蔓、叶子和玉米的穗轴是猪的良好饲料。多多收获这些产品，对解决饲料缺乏的问题具有很大的作用。今年许多地区都扩大了甘薯、玉米、花生的种植面积，这些作物的副产物要比往年多，应该注意收储，留作牲畜的饲料。
    为了增加收获量，必须改进收割方法。有些青年农民收获技术不熟练，应该加强对他们的技术传授。今年夏收期间，不少地区的农民用师傅带徒弟的办法传授收获技术，效果很好，应该提倡。在去年秋收和今年夏收中，有些农业合作社的社员只顾抢挣工分，忽视收割质量，抛撒很多粮食。对这样的人，要加强集体主义教育。同时，还应该改进农业合作社的工分制度，把精收细打列为计算工分的标准之一。今年许多地区推广了大量的打谷机，各技术推广站要加强技术传授，充分发挥打谷机的作用，提高脱粒效率，减少粮食抛撒现象。在今年夏收期间，不少地区的农民发明了新的收获农具，改进了旧的收获农具，对提高收获效率、减少粮食抛撒很有作用，应该在秋收中加以推广。
    秋收工作包括收割、挑运、脱粒、翻晒、储藏等许多环节。在每个环节上都给以充分的注意，才能最大限度地提高收获量。过去不少地区常常因为忽视翻晒和储藏而使粮食、棉花质量下降，甚至发生霉坏现象，今年要严加防止。今年薯类作物种植面积增加很多，薯类又不易储藏保管，这个问题要及早解决，以免发生不应有的损失。
    现有的六十多万个农业生产合作社都要力争在秋收工作中发挥示范作用，努力精收细打，确保丰产丰收。
    就全国范围来说，目前距收获期还有一段时间，可用来做好保收工作。不少地区的粮食和其他作物还在生长后期，加强这些作物的田间管理，对提高产量还有一定的作用。施行棉花早熟的措施，可以提高棉花的产量和质量。防治晚稻的害虫，防止干旱和倒伏现象，就能保证晚稻增产。不论南方北方，各种作物在收获以前还有遭受自然灾害的可能，必须注意防旱、防虫、防风、防霜的工作。有些农村工作人员看到丰收在望，即将收割，因而放松了对于保收工作的领导，这是错误的。丰收在望并不等于已经丰收。收获前疏于防范而使农作物遭灾减产的教训是很多的。我们必须记取这些教训，绝不能让一年辛苦的劳动果实遭受损害。
    秋收以前和秋收中的保卫工作必须特别加强。今年夏收期间，有些地区曾发生反革命分子烧毁和偷盗农业合作社的粮食等事件。目前有的地区又发现反革命分子偷砍庄稼的现象。全体农村工作人员和农民群众都应该提高警惕，不让反革命分子的任何破坏阴谋得逞。
