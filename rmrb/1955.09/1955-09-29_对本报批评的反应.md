    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper
    The General Office of the Ministry of Heavy Industry wrote: The People's Daily editorial on August 17, "Seriously Inspect the Work of Resettling Demobilized Construction Soldiers," contained correct criticisms of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. Although the Ministry of Heavy Industry had done some resettlement work for demobilized construction soldiers in the past, inspections reveal that there were indeed many shortcomings. From the leadership's perspective, we did not conduct thorough inspections and supervision of various enterprises. Therefore, some bureaus, companies, and enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry lacked sufficient understanding of the significance of resettling demobilized construction soldiers. Individual enterprises even adopted erroneous attitudes such as squeezing out, attacking, and arbitrarily dismissing demobilized construction soldiers. These situations have already attracted our attention, and we have taken the following specific measures in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's decision: (1) We have issued a circular to all enterprises stating that demobilized construction soldiers who must be resettled by the enterprise after local research and balancing should be accepted regardless of whether the enterprise needs personnel, and their work should be properly arranged. (2) When recruiting personnel with the approval of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, we should try our best to recruit from demobilized construction soldiers. (3) Demobilized construction soldiers who were originally temporary workers in our enterprises should generally be treated in accordance with the provisions of the contract. Those who are truly homeless and cannot be placed in other jobs should not be dismissed by the enterprise (some can be transferred to formal workers). At the same time, we plan to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the work of enterprises in resettling demobilized construction soldiers, criticize units that have not done a good job in resettlement, and punish individual units that find excuses to avoid employing demobilized construction soldiers.

    对本报批评的反应
    重工业部办公厅来信说：八月十七日人民日报社论“认真检查安置复员建设军人的工作”中对重工业部的批评是正确的。过去重工业部虽然对复员建设军人进行了一些安置工作，但是检查起来确实还有很多缺点。从领导方面来看，我们对各企业认真检查、督促不够，因此，重工业部所属一部分局、公司及企业，对安置复员建设军人的意义认识不足，个别企业对复员建设军人甚至采取排挤打击和随意解雇等错误态度。这些情况已经引起了我们的注意，我们并根据国务院决议的精神，采取了以下几点具体措施：（一）通令各企业凡经地方研究平衡必须企业安置的复员建设军人，不论企业是否需要人员，均应接受，并妥善安置其工作。（二）经重工业部批准外招人员时，尽量从复员建设军人中录用。（三）复员建设军人原在我们企业担任临时工的，一般应按合同规定执行，其中如确系无家可归，又无法安置其他工作者，企业不准辞退（有的可转为正式工人）。同时，我们拟对企业安置复员建设军人的工作作一次全面检查，对安置不好的单位予以批评，对寻找借口不愿录用复员建设军人等个别单位予以处分。
