Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, September 28th: According to TASS, Ulan Bator, September 28th, Mongolian People's Republic Prime Minister Zeedanbal wrote a letter on September 27th to the President of the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, José Maza, requesting the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations.

The letter stated: The Mongolian People's Republic, as a democratic and sovereign state, has consistently pursued a policy of peace. The contributions made by the Mongolian People's Republic in the struggle of all countries against fascist aggression, and the active struggle of the Mongolian people to safeguard world peace, are fully in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic has submitted an application to join the United Nations and has expressed its willingness to undertake the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. However, regrettably, this request has not yet been met. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that the Geneva Four-Power Summit and the current Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly are conducive to the development of friendly relations between countries and the consolidation of world peace and security, and therefore reiterates its request to admit the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations.

    泽登巴尔总理致电联合国大会主席
    要求接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社乌兰巴托二十八日讯：蒙古人民共和国总理泽登巴尔二十七日写信给联合国大会第十届会议主席何塞·马萨，要求接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。
    信中说：蒙古人民共和国作为民主的主权国家，过去和现在都执行着和平政策，蒙古人民共和国在各国反对法西斯侵略的斗争中所作的贡献，蒙古人民为保障全世界和平而进行的积极斗争完全符合联合国宪章的原则。蒙古人民共和国政府已经提出加入联合国的申请，并且表示愿意承担联合国宪章所规定的义务。但是，遗憾的是，这个请求直到现在还没有得到满足。蒙古人民共和国政府认为，日内瓦四国政府首脑会议和目前正在举行的联合国大会第十届会议有助于国与国之间友好关系的发展和世界和平与安全的巩固，因而再次请求接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。
