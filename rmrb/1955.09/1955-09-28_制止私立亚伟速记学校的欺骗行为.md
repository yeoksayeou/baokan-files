    Stop the Deceptive Practices of the Private Yawei Stenography School

    Editor's Note: After the "Reader's Letters Special" on September 11th exposed the deceptive practices of the Private Yawei Stenography School, we have received many letters from readers in various locations continuing to reflect a number of situations. The letter from reader Xixia published below fully illustrates that the Private Yawei Stenography School is a consistently fraudulent organization. This applies not only to the correspondence department, but also to the face-to-face instruction department and the Stenography Monthly. Even more serious is that this school has consistently adopted a perfunctory and even resistant attitude towards government supervision and criticism.

    In order to safeguard the interests of the people, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industrial and Agricultural Spare-Time Education and the Cultural Bureau, based on the report from the Xidan District People's Committee and the reflections of the masses in various locations, have submitted a request to the Beijing Municipal People's Committee for approval to cease all activities of the Private Yawei Stenography School: the correspondence department should be shut down immediately, and no new students should be recruited; students who request a refund must be refunded by the school. The specialized course of the face-to-face instruction department should immediately cease instruction, and the school should transfer the existing students along with all tuition and miscellaneous fees to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industrial and Agricultural Spare-Time Education for handling; the training courses will be maintained by the school until the end of September to complete the term. Publication and distribution of the Stenography Monthly will be temporarily suspended pending review and handling.

Comrade Editor:

    After reading the article "Deceptive Practices of the Private Yawei Stenography School Correspondence Department" published in the People's Daily "Reader's Letters Special" on September 11th, I felt very indignant. According to my understanding, the government has repeatedly educated the Private Yawei Stenography School, urging them to improve their teaching work; however, they have consistently adopted a perfunctory and resistant attitude. For example, the person in charge of the Xidan District People's Committee of Beijing once instructed Tang Yawei, the principal of the Private Yawei Stenography School, in person in May 1954 to "compress the scope of correspondence education and conduct key experiments"; Tang Yawei used "returning to study" as a shield and refused to accept it. Before this, he had already heard the news that the government wanted them to compress the scope of correspondence education, so he rushed to send telegrams to various places and published advertisements in twenty-four newspapers across the country, massively recruiting students. Because the success rate of this school's correspondence department is extremely low, the Cultural and Educational Section of the Xidan District People's Committee once asked them to reduce the number of correspondence students from 500 to less than 300 per month; however, in the winter of 1954, this school submitted a so-called "reform plan" to the government, which not only did not contain any practical measures to improve the work, but also increased the number of correspondence students to 600 per month under the pretext of adding one teacher. In April of this year, due to the government's repeated urging of them to improve their work, they proposed an even more absurd "reform plan." This "plan" would cancel student coursework and replace it with irregular examinations; that is to say, they could be even less responsible for the students' learning than before, and they would not even have to correct the coursework, and whether the exams were held would also be at their discretion. In addition, they proposed that the calculation of the success rate of correspondence education should be based on the number of students enrolled minus the number of students who stopped studying and withdrew, so that the success rate of less than two per thousand could be increased to one hundred percent. Not long ago, they proposed a "one-level continuous system" plan, merging the elementary and advanced classes, each with a study period of six months, into one level, with a study period of only six months. They also cleverly created a graduation counseling class. In this way, the advanced class with success rate requirements was cancelled, but the money-grabbing continued as usual.

    The Private Yawei Stenography School is not only a fraud in its correspondence department, but the situations in the "Stenography Monthly" and the face-to-face instruction department are also the same. The "Stenography Monthly" publishes advertisements all over the country, massively promoting itself. In addition to spreading some reactionary ideas, it also excessively boasts about its own school. The face-to-face instruction training courses meet three times a week, for a total of six hours, for a period of four months, for a total of ninety-six hours; very few people who study there become proficient. When enrolling, each class always has more than thirty students, but only six or seven people remain at graduation. Many of the graduates of the specialized courses also cannot use what they have learned. They can take down notes but cannot translate them. However, because the students in the specialized courses in the past were all staff members of agencies or troops, they used this point for deceptive publicity, printing and distributing in large quantities the names of the students and the designations of their troops and agencies to gain the trust of others. In addition, they once boasted that a student in a specialized course recorded a speed of 282 words per minute; but in reality, this was not the speed for one minute, but the speed for five minutes. When someone asked Tang Yawei "Why do you exaggerate the publicity?", Tang Yawei replied: "To expand influence!"

    Such deceptive behavior is absolutely intolerable. I believe that the government's education and help to the Private Yawei Stenography School have reached the point of utmost benevolence; since the Private Yawei Stenography School has not shown any signs of repentance to this day, this error should be seriously dealt with.

### 制止私立亚伟速记学校的欺骗行为

    制止私立亚伟速记学校的欺骗行为
    编者按：九月十一日“读者来信专页”揭发了私立亚伟速记学校的欺骗行为后，我们又收到各地很多读者来信，继续反映了不少情况。下面发表的读者西霞的来信，就充分说明私立亚伟速记学校是一个一贯招摇撞骗的组织，不仅函授部如此，面授部和速记月报也完全一样；而更严重的是，这个学校还对政府的监督和批评始终采取阳奉阴违甚至抗拒的态度。
    为了保障人民的利益，北京市工农业余教育局和文化局根据西单区人民委员会的报告和各地群众的反映，已经呈请北京市人民委员会批准，决定停止私立亚伟速记学校的一切活动：函授部立即停办，不得再招收新生；本期学员有要求退费的，学校必须退费。面授部的专修科立即停止授课，由学校将现有学员连同所交学杂费一律转交北京市工农业余教育局负责处理；讲习班由学校负责维持到九月底结业。速记月报暂时停止出版和发行，听候审查处理。编辑同志：
    读了九月十一日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表的“私立亚伟速记学校函授部的欺骗行为”一文后，我感到非常愤慨。据我了解，政府对私立亚伟速记学校曾多次进行教育，要他们改进教学工作；但是他们却一直采取敷衍和抗拒的态度。例如，北京市西单区人民委员会负责人曾经在一九五四年五月当面指示私立亚伟速记学校校长唐亚伟“压缩函授范围，进行重点试验”；唐亚伟以“回去研究”作挡箭牌，拒绝接受。在这以前，他已经听到政府要他们压缩函授范围的消息，就抢先给各地发电报，在全国二十四种报纸上刊登广告，大肆招生。由于这个学校函授部的成功率极低，西单区人民委员会文教科曾要求他们把函授学生的人数由每月五百人减到三百人以下；但是一九五四年冬，这个学校却向政府提出了一个所谓“改革方案”，不仅里面没有什么改进工作的实际措施，反而借口增加教员一人而把函授学员人数增加到每月六百人。今年四月间，由于政府一再督促他们改进工作，他们又提出了一个更加荒唐的“改革方案”。这个“方案”要取消学员课卷，改为不定期考试；也就是说，他们可以对学员的学习比以前更不负责任，连课卷都不必改了，考试是否举行也随便了。此外，他们还提出函授成功率的算法应当是从学员入学人数中减去停学和退学的人数，这样就可以把不足千分之二的成功率提高到百分之百。不久以前，他们又提出了一个“一级一贯制”的方案，把修业期限各为六个月的初级班和高级班合并为一级，学习期间也只有六个月，另外又巧立名目地增设一个毕业辅导班。这样，有成功率要求的高级班取消了，而骗钱还是照旧。
    私立亚伟速记学校不仅函授部是个骗局，“速记月报”和面授部两个部分的情况也同样。“速记月报”在全国各地遍登广告，大肆推销，里面除了散布一些反动思想外，还对自己学校乱加吹嘘。面授部讲习班每周上三次课，共六小时，全期四个月，共九十六小时；学成的人也很少，入学时每班学员总有三十多人，但结业时只剩下六、七个人了。专修科毕业学员中很多也是学完了不能用，记得下而翻译不出来。但是，由于过去专修科的学生都是机关或部队的工作人员，他们就利用这一点作欺骗宣传，把学员及其所在部队番号和机关的名称大量刊印，普遍散发，来骗取别人的信任。另外，他们还曾大肆吹嘘专修科某班学员记录速度每分钟达二百八十二字的成绩；但是实际上，这并不是一分钟的速度，而是五分钟的速度。当有人问唐亚伟“为什么要夸大宣传”时，唐亚伟答复说：“为了扩大影响！”
    这样的欺骗行为是令人绝对不能容忍的。我认为，政府对私立亚伟速记学校的教育和帮助已经到了仁至义尽的地步了；既然私立亚伟速记学校到现在仍然没有丝毫悔改的表现，就应该对这种错误进行严肃的处理。　西霞
