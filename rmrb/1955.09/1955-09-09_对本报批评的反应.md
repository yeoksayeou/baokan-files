    Reactions to the Newspaper's Criticism
    The short essay "Should Stop Him," published in this newspaper on April 16th, criticized Liu Zhizhong, acting deputy director of the Liaoyang City and County Grain Bureau in Liaoning Province, for supporting family speculation and manipulation and developing the rich peasant economy. Because Liu Zhizhong earnestly reflected on his mistakes, expressed his determination to repent, and demonstrated a positive attitude in his work, the Liaoyang Municipal People's Committee decided to give him a lenient punishment of a major demerit.

    The Shanxi Provincial Administrative Cadre School wrote: The criticism in the People's Daily article "Are 'Old Books Waste Paper'?" published on August 13th, regarding the leakage of secrets in our school, is correct. We conducted a review and handled this breach of confidentiality error in March of this year. In the future, we will continue to heighten our vigilance, tighten our systems, and plug all loopholes in thought and action to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

    对本报批评的反应
    本报四月十六日刊登的小品文“应该喝住他”，批评了辽宁省辽阳市、县粮食局代理副局长刘志忠支持家庭投机捣把，发展富农经济的错误行为。由于刘志忠对待自己所犯的错误认真地进行了反省，表示了悔过的决心，同时在工作中表现积极，所以辽阳市人民委员会决定从轻给予记大过处分。
