    Xuanhua Farmers Divert Floodwaters to Irrigate 170,000 Mu of Land

    Farmers in Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, have utilized mountain floodwaters to irrigate more than 170,000 mu of land. The crops grown after irrigation are particularly robust. Farmers in mountainous villages, driven by agricultural producers' cooperatives, have diverted floodwaters from small ditches and tributaries to irrigate their land. In the Dongping Village of District One, a three-meter-high mortar stone dam was built at the mouth of a mountain ditch near the village, and a canal was dug to divert floodwaters to irrigate 180 mu of corn and millet; a canal was dug around the mountain to irrigate more than 600 mu. The land irrigated by floodwaters diverted by farmers on both sides of the Yanghe River has been silted with a layer of five-tenths to one inch of mud, reducing the amount of sediment in the river.

    宣化农民引洪浇地十七万亩
    河北省宣化县农民利用山洪水浇地十七万多亩。浇后的庄稼长的特别茁壮。山地村庄的农民在农业生产合作社的带动下，把小沟、小叉的洪水引来浇地。一区东坪村在村边山沟口修了三公尺高的一道浆石坝，挖了一道渠，引洪浇了一百八十亩玉米、谷子；环山挖了一道渠浇了六百多亩。洋河两岸的农民引洪浇灌的地都淤上五分至一寸的泥，减少了河内泥沙。
