A Futile Undertaking
Jiang Yuan-chun

After Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu agreed to America's demand to "contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security in the West Pacific," the Japanese Foreign Ministry revealed that Japanese troops would be dispatched to Taiwan and South Korea at the very least. On September 22, the British magazine "Foreign Report" also emphasized this possibility.

"Foreign Report" also cited rumors circulating in Tokyo that there is a possibility of expanding the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to include other Asian countries. The magazine said that during the U.S.-Japan talks, Dulles suggested forming an alliance between Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, to which Shigemitsu "has already expressed his agreement."

As everyone knows, the United States has long wanted to rope in Japan, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to form a so-called Northeast Asia alliance, in order to connect with the Southeast Asia bloc and form a military system along the West Pacific. The news from the British "Foreign Report" shows that after the U.S.-Japan talks, this plan, which had been met with setbacks everywhere, is stirring again. Here, Shigemitsu seems to want to exert special effort to gain American support for him.

Japan's renewed attempt to engage in aggressive military blocs means that the reviving Japanese militarism is already preparing for aggression in its nascent state. Japan's desire to organize a military bloc with the Chiang Kai-shek clique also means that the spearhead of this preparation for aggression is directed against the People's Republic of China.

Obviously, if Shigemitsu really agrees to form an alliance with the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee cliques as reported by the British "Foreign Report," and agrees to send Japanese troops to South Korea and China's territory of Taiwan, then he is determined to drag Japan onto the path of militarist aggression that almost destroyed Japan, and onto the path of once again directly antagonizing the Chinese people. This is something the Chinese people will never tolerate, and something the Asian people will never tolerate.

It should be pointed out that regardless of whether Shigemitsu has already made this decision, the development of the situation shows that the possibility of Japan being dragged onto the path of aggression that antagonizes the Chinese and Asian people is realistically existing. Recently, with the active support of the United States, the revival of Japanese militarism is accelerating. A group of former Japanese "Imperial Army" generals have been openly appointed as members of the "Defense Agency's" military advisory group. All kinds of organizations of right-wing, militaristic, former "Imperial Army" officers are receiving open protection and encouragement. Despite the fact that the lives of the Japanese people have become increasingly difficult due to the increasing military burden, Sunada, the Director-General of the Japanese "Defense Agency," recently announced that he would provide these organizations with "economic assistance." The revival of militarist education is also being carried out in all aspects. According to Sunada, the Japanese "Defense Agency" is planning to establish a 100,000-strong "national army" and is preparing to implement a "reserve Self-Defense Force officer" system, providing one year or ten months of military training for high school graduates.

At the same time, with the encouragement and assistance of the United States, Japan's military industry, especially the aircraft industry, is being greatly expanded. The Japanese people are united in resolutely opposing atomic and hydrogen weapons, but the Japanese government not only allows the United States to expand atomic bases and transport atomic weapons into Japan, but the Japanese "Defense Agency" has also established a special agency to engage in atomic warfare research. The Japanese government also allows the United States to train personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques on Japanese territory, actively participating in subversive activities in Asia. The Japanese "Defense Agency" recently decided to send a senior military officer to Taiwan to collect military intelligence about the People's Republic of China.

All of this, of course, is not for the Japanese people to live a peaceful and tranquil life, not for the free development of Japan's peaceful industry and commerce, and certainly not for Japan to be able to break free from foreign control and become an independent, peaceful, and democratic country. On the contrary, these activities can only further awaken the painful memories of the Japanese people from all walks of life and Japanese patriots. They know how terrible a price they paid for the Japanese militarism’s acts of aggression.

It is precisely because of this reason that more than 30 million Japanese people signed a petition demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and they firmly oppose foreign control. It is precisely because of this reason that many Japanese peaceful industrialists and businessmen demand trade with China and the Soviet Union. It is also precisely because of this reason that patriotic political forces from all aspects of Japan and the Japanese people together demand that Japan restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, break away from the path of reviving militarism, and become a member of the Asian family of peaceful nations. The demands of this peaceful force within Japan are consistent with the aspirations of the people of Asian countries. It has countless friends in Asia and receives immeasurable and powerful support.

The more Shigemitsu and his gang secretly try to follow foreign countries in engaging in military blocs and reviving militarism, the more they will make themselves stand in opposition to the people of their own country and stand in opposition to the people of Asia. Seeking foreign support while opposing one's own people is a futile undertaking. There are many examples, which shouldn't be difficult to see.

    毫无前途的事业
    蒋元椿
    在日本外务相重光葵答应美国“对维持西太平洋的国际和平和安全作出贡献”以后，日本外务省曾经透露，日本军队至少将被派往台湾和南朝鲜。九月二十二日英国“外事报道”杂志也强调了这样一个可能性。
    “外事报道”还引东京方面流传的消息说，现在还存在着扩大美日“安全条约”而将其他亚洲国家包括在内的可能性。这家杂志说，在日美会谈中，杜勒斯曾经提出成立日本、台湾和南朝鲜联盟的建议，重光葵“已经表示同意”。
    大家知道，美国很久以来就想拉拢日本、李承晚集团和蒋介石集团组织所谓东北亚联盟，以便同东南亚集团联结起来，构成一个沿西太平洋的军事体系。英国“外事报道”的消息表明，在日美会谈以后，这个曾经到处碰壁的计划又在蠢蠢欲动。在这里，重光似乎想特别卖气力，来换取美国对他的支持。
    日本再一次图谋搞侵略性的军事集团，意味着复活中的日本军国主义在其萌芽状态已经在想准备侵略。日本要同蒋介石集团组织军事集团，又意味着这种准备侵略的矛头，针对着中华人民共和国。
    很明显，如果重光葵真的像英国“外事报道”所报道的那样，同意同蒋介石和李承晚集团缔结联盟，同意派遣日本军队到南朝鲜和中国的领土台湾去，那么，他就是打定主意要把日本拖上曾经几乎毁灭日本的军国主义侵略的道路，拖上再一次同中国人民直接为敌的道路。这是中国人民决不能容忍，也是亚洲人民所决不能容忍的。
    应当指出，不论重光现在是否已经打定这个主意，事态的发展表明，日本被拖上同中国人民和亚洲人民为敌的侵略道路的可能性，是现实地存在着的。近来，在美国积极扶植之下，日本军国主义复活的速度正在加紧。一批日本旧“皇军”的将领已经被公然任命为“防卫厅”的军事顾问团的成员。一切右翼的、军国主义的、旧“皇军”的军官的各种组织受到公开的保护和鼓励。尽管日本人民的生活已经由于日益加重的军事负担而越来越困苦，日本“防卫厅”长官砂田最近还宣布要给这些组织以“经济援助”。复活军国主义的教育也在从各方面进行。据砂田透露，日本“防卫厅”正在计划建立一支十万人的“国民兵”，并准备实行“预备自卫官”制度，对高等学校的毕业生进行一年或十个月的军事训练。
    同时，在美国的鼓励和协助下，日本的军事工业，尤其是飞机工业正在大事扩充。日本人民万众一心坚决反对原子武器和氢武器，但是，日本政府却不但容许美国在日本扩建原子基地、运进原子武器，而且日本“防卫厅”已经设立专门机构来从事原子战争的研究。日本政府还允许美国在日本领土上训练蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳集团的人员，积极参与在亚洲的颠覆活动。日本“防卫厅”最近并决定派遣一名高级军官到台湾去搜集关于中华人民共和国的军事情报。
    所有这一切，当然不是为了使日本人民过和平安宁的生活，当然不是为了使日本和平工商业自由发展，当然更不是为了使日本能够摆脱外来控制，成为独立、和平、民主的国家。恰恰相反，这些活动只能更加唤起日本各阶层人民和日本各方面爱国人士的痛苦的记忆。他们知道，他们曾经为日本军国主义的侵略行为，付出了多么惨痛的代价。
    正是因为这个缘故，所以三千多万日本人民签名要求禁止原子武器、氢武器，他们坚决反对外来控制。正是因为这个缘故，所以许多日本和平工商业者要求同中国和苏联进行贸易。也正是因为这个缘故，日本各个方面的爱国政治力量和日本人民一道，要求日本同中国和苏联恢复正常关系，摆脱复活军国主义的道路，成为亚洲和平国家大家庭中的一员。日本国内这种和平力量的要求同亚洲各国人民的愿望是一致的。它在亚洲有数不清的朋友，得到无法估计的有力的支持。
    重光葵及其一伙越是偷偷摸摸地想跟在外国后面搞军事集团，搞复活军国主义，他们就要越来越使自己跟自己本国的人民相对立，越来越跟亚洲人民相对立。谋取外国的支持而同本国人民对立，是毫无前途的事业。例子很多应该不难看到。
