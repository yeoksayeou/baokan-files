Following the implementation of fixed grain supply in cities and towns, farmers in various parts of Hebei Province are working even harder to increase grain production and support national construction.

    Jiaowangzhuang Township in Tong County is very close to Tongzhou City. After hearing that Tongzhou City implemented fixed grain supply on September 1, and that cadres, workers, and citizens in various organs are trying every means to save grain, many farmers expressed that they would both increase grain production and save grain to promote the early realization of the country's First Five-Year Plan.

    Inspired by the fixed grain supply measures in cities and towns, all members of the Yuzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangjiazhuang Township on the outskirts of Baoding City have re-formulated their production increase plan and have worked out many ways to strengthen the late-stage management of field crops. They will support the government's new grain policy with practical actions of completing the increase of 7,000 jin of cotton and 10,000 jin of grain.

    Li Luolian, director of the Ziyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuhe Village, Mancheng County, said: "If cities save grain and we work hard to increase production, with both sides working together, the country will have more grain, and the strength to build socialism will be greater." The cooperative plans to apply 500 jin of fertilizer to 30 mu of late cornfields and prune 120 mu of cotton fields one more time, in order to increase grain and cotton production to support national construction.

    实行市镇粮食定量供应后  河北农民更加努力增产粮食
    河北省各地农民在城市实行粮食定量供应办法后，更加努力增产粮食，支援国家建设。
    通县焦王庄乡离通州市很近，农民们听到通州市从九月一日实行了粮食定量供应，各机关干部、工人、市民都想尽各种办法节约粮食，很多农民表示他们要一面多增产粮食，一面也节约粮食，以促进国家第一个五年建设计划早日实现。
    保定市郊尚家庄乡裕众农业生产合作社全体社员在市镇粮食定量供应办法鼓舞下，重新制定了增产计划，并研究出许多加强田间作物后期管理的办法。他们要以完成增产棉花七千斤，粮食一万斤的实际行动，拥护政府新的粮食政策。
    满城县于河村自愿农业生产合作社社长李洛连说：“城市节约粮食，我们努力增产，两下齐使劲，国家的粮食就多了，建设社会主义的力量就大了。”该社计划在三十亩晚玉米地里施五百斤肥田粉和把一百二十亩棉田多整一遍枝，以增产粮棉支援国家建设。　（本报集体通讯员河北日报编辑部）
