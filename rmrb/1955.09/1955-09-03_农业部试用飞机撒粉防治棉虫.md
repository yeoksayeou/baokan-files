The Ministry of Agriculture is testing aerial spraying of powder to control cotton pests in Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province. On the morning of July 25th, an agricultural aircraft flew over Herui, Fufeng, and other townships in Dafeng County, spraying "666" sulfur powder pesticide to control cotton field pests. By August 11th, the first round of spraying was basically completed, covering more than 49,000 mu of cotton fields in four townships including Fufeng, Herui, and Taifeng. Within two days after spraying, all leaf rollers died. Cotton seedlings without mirid bugs before spraying did not develop new infestations after spraying. Encouraged by the national government's dispatch of aircraft to support pest control, local cotton farmers are actively strengthening cotton field management, weeding for the fifth time, continuing pruning and topping, and applying large amounts of fertilizer to strive for over-production of cotton to support national construction.

    农业部试用飞机撒粉防治棉虫
    农业部在江苏省大丰县试用飞机喷撒药粉防治棉虫。七月二十五日清晨，一架农用飞机，飞临大丰县和瑞、阜丰等乡上空，喷撒“二二三”硫磺粉药剂防治棉田虫害，到八月十一日，第一次喷药基本结束，喷药面积包括阜丰、和瑞、太丰等四个乡四万九千多亩棉田。喷药后卷叶虫两天内全部死亡，棉苗嫩叶原来没有盲椿象的，喷药后就不再生虫。当地棉农在国家派出飞机支援灭虫的鼓舞下，正积极加强棉田管理，赶锄第五遍草，继续整枝摘心，增施大量肥田粉，争取超额增产棉花，支援国家建设。（本报驻南京记者）
