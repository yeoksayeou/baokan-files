Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th TASS Dispatch: The full text of Walter Ulbricht's speech at the negotiations between the Soviet government delegation and the German Democratic Republic government delegation on September 19, 1955, is as follows: Comrade Chairman, dear friends!

    Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and Comrade Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, have fully and consistently described the historical significance of this draft treaty. The comprehensive treaty under discussion places an extremely important responsibility on the People's Chamber, the Cabinet, and all citizens of the German Democratic Republic. Article 1 of the treaty states that the German Democratic Republic has the freedom to determine its own foreign and domestic policies, including relations with the Federal Republic of West Germany. In contrast, the treaties concluded by the Bonn government with Western countries restrict the rights of the Federal Republic of West Germany and guarantee the Western occupying powers the right to station troops and interfere in West Germany's internal affairs for fifty years.

    The treaty concluded between our two countries is a manifestation of a new type of relationship between countries in the democratic and socialist camp. The first obligation arising from the right to freely decide German affairs is the lofty obligation to strive to safeguard and consolidate European and world peace through sincere and friendly cooperation with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

    From its very establishment, the German Democratic Republic has regarded its most important task as blocking the path of German militarism and making the German Democratic Republic the only truly independent German state, a bastion of peace and democracy. West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its re-militarization have created obstacles in Germany to the restoration of German unity.

    In order to maintain their political and economic power, the monopoly capitalists, bankers, and landlords who rule West Germany have caused the division of Germany and subjected West Germany to the interests of foreign financial capitalists. The peace-loving German people must never tolerate West Germany being dragged into the North Atlantic Treaty, because this threatens the people's peaceful life and causes the division of Germany. The Bonn government would rather re-militarize than restore unity. It obstructs the people from freely deciding through a plebiscite whether they are in favor of a peace treaty and reunification, or in favor of the Paris Accords and re-militarization; these actions by the Bonn government confirm its intention to once again embark on the old road that has twice brought catastrophe to Germany. An increasing number of people from all walks of life in West Germany recognize that the signing of the Paris Accords was a fatal mistake because these accords are incompatible with the cause of reunifying Germany.

    Now, the treaty being concluded between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can help peace-loving Germans consolidate peace and make them realize that all of Germany must not be subject to the dictates of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and West German militarists.

    The comprehensive treaty being concluded stems from the right of the German Democratic Republic to freely determine its domestic and foreign affairs.

    I would like to say a few words on this point. True freedom is only possible where there is a solid foundation of freedom—the rule of the working class in alliance with the working peasants and intellectuals. In West Germany, the power of monopoly capital has been re-established with the support of the occupying countries; while in the German Democratic Republic, the working people have implemented the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and the Four-Power Control Council regarding the eradication of German militarism, the implementation of land reform, and the elimination of monopoly capital. We understand very well that this practice has angered certain monopoly capitalists and landlords in West Germany, and therefore they oppose the recognition of the German Democratic Republic.

    However, this does not in the slightest change the actual facts, and the worker-peasant government is still growing and achieving success.

    Now, in the German Democratic Republic, the transformation of life on a peaceful and democratic basis is irresistibly moving forward, the laws, instructions, and orders of the Control Council are becoming ineffective, and the people's legislation is fully exercising its power, which is naturally welcomed by the residents of the German Democratic Republic. In West Germany, the ruling group, disregarding the will of the majority of residents, has linked West Germany to the North Atlantic Treaty and is hastily passing military laws in Bonn, which creates a difficult and complex situation in the matter of restoring German unity.

    In this comprehensive treaty of such great significance, it is stated that the cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, whether in maintaining and consolidating universal peace and European security, or in the joint efforts to reunite Germany into a peaceful and democratic state and to peacefully resolve the German question, is in the interests of the German people and the Soviet people, and is equally in the interests of the people of other European countries.

    The German people are very grateful to the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, as well as to Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev themselves, for taking the initiative in easing international tensions. This will also make it possible to ease tensions in Germany. We wholeheartedly welcome the agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet government on the establishment of diplomatic relations and economic and cultural cooperation, because this also helps to ease tensions and may contribute to the reconciliation of the two parts of Germany. The revival of German militarism is obviously the main threat to the peaceful life of the people of European countries. No one can expect us to enable German revanchists to strengthen their position by adopting the old trick of Hitler's election in 1933, and to advance their military bases to the Oder River in order to provoke a war afterwards.

    Now there is only one way to defend peace in Europe and reunify Germany, and that is to break the militaristic alliance in Europe with a collective security treaty between all European countries. Prime Minister Grotewohl has suggested further rapprochement between the two parts of Germany. Cooperation between workers, working peasants, trade unions, athletes, and cultural workers in the two German states has already made satisfactory progress. Due to the political and legal status of the two German states, it is necessary for both countries to recognize each other and resolve various issues that exist directly between the two governments.

    Especially since the government agencies of the German Democratic Republic took over border management and traffic control between West Germany and West Berlin through the territory of the German Democratic Republic, there is no other way to resolve the various disputed issues except through formal negotiations between the two governments. Important political figures in Bonn and West Berlin cannot but admit that the plan to subvert the German Democratic Republic through the Cold War is doomed to failure, no matter how difficult it is to admit this. The sooner they admit it, the better it will be for the residents of West Berlin.

    Let the West German federal government soberly assess the situation and recognize that it can only exercise its rights in the Federal Republic of West Germany. Its statements regarding German borders are worthless, because there are still valid international treaties.

    We agree that Soviet troops should continue to remain in the German Democratic Republic to guard peace. As long as Western countries do not intend to withdraw their troops and abolish their military bases from West Germany, it is necessary for Soviet troops to be stationed on the territory of the German Democratic Republic. This does not affect the responsibility of the worker-peasant regime to effectively protect the homeland of the working people—the German Democratic Republic—through their own armed forces. After Bonn passes military laws and carries out the work of establishing an aggressive "Bundeswehr"—which has already begun—the German Democratic Republic will strictly implement its obligations and rights arising from the Warsaw Treaty.

    The new comprehensive treaty—which marks the beginning of a new period in the development of the German Democratic Republic—is based on the consolidated and inviolable friendship between the German people and the various nationalities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It establishes political and legal relations based on equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, which is conducive to the further strengthening and expansion of the friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This entire treaty will help further develop the economic, scientific-technical, and cultural relations between our two countries. At the same time, it will help strengthen the camp of democratic and socialist countries.

    We hope that strong friendly relations will develop between all the German people and the Soviet Union. Promoting a peaceful resolution of the German question as a whole is our common task. The worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic feels it has a responsibility to defend the peaceful and democratic interests of all the German people, so that their highest aspiration—a peaceful resolution of the German question—can be realized.

    We are convinced that the German working class, working peasants, intellectuals, and all other peace-loving Germans will learn from the disasters of the two world wars and will bravely choose the path of fighting for peace, democracy, and progress. The current comprehensive treaty will help strengthen the worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic, thereby contributing to the great and just cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    Dear Soviet friends, we sincerely thank you for the friendly cooperation you have given us in drafting the comprehensive new treaty, which is equally beneficial to the interests of our two peoples.

    乌布利希的发言
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：一九五五年九月十九日，瓦尔特·乌布利希在苏联政府代表团和德意志民主共和国政府代表团谈判时发言全文如下：主席同志，亲爱的朋友们！
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥同志已经完全相一致地叙述了这个条约草案的历史意义。现在所讨论的全面条约加给德意志民主共和国的人民议院、内阁和全体公民一项极其重大的责任。在条约第一条中说，德意志民主共和国有决定自己的对外和对内政策、包括对西德联邦共和国的关系的自由。而波恩政府同西方国家缔结的条约则相反，它们的条约限制了西德联邦共和国的权利，并且在五十年中保证西方占领国家驻扎军队和干涉西德内政。
    我们两国缔结的条约是民主和社会主义阵营国家的新型关系的表现。从自己自由地决定德国事务的权利而产生的第一个义务，就是依靠同苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的真诚和友好的合作而致力于维护和巩固欧洲和世界和平这个崇高的义务。
    德意志民主共和国从它一成立的时候起就认为它的最重要的任务是：堵塞德国军国主义的道路，使德意志民主共和国成为唯一的真正自主的德意志国家，成为和平和民主的堡垒。西德的参加北大西洋集团和重新军国主义化，在德国造成了妨碍德国恢复统一的障碍。
    统治西德的垄断资本家、银行家和地主阶级为了保持他们的政治和经济权力，引起了德国的分裂，并且使西德屈从于外国金融资本家的利益。爱好和平的德国人民决不能容忍把西德拖入北大西洋公约，因为这使人民的和平生活受到威胁，并且引起德国的分裂。波恩政府宁愿重新军国主义化而不愿意恢复统一。它阻挠人民通过公民投票来自由决定：他们赞成和约和重新统一，还是赞成巴黎协定和重新军国主义化；波恩政府的这些行动证实了它打算再度走上已经两次使德国遭受浩劫的老路。在西德越来越多的各界人士认识到，巴黎协定的签订是一个致命的错误，因为这些协定同重新统一德国的事业是不相容的。
    现在，德意志民主共和国同苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟正在缔订中的条约，可以帮助爱好和平的德国人巩固和平，使他们认识到，整个德国是绝不能听从北大西洋公约组织和西德军国主义者的号令的。
    缔订中的全面条约是从德意志民主共和国所具有的自由决定内政和外交事务的权利而来的。
    对这一点我要说几句话，只有在具备自由的巩固基础——同劳动农民和知识分子结成联盟的工人阶级统治的地方，才有真正的自由。在西德，在占领国家的支持下垄断资本的政权重新建立起来了；而在德意志民主共和国中，劳动人民实现了波茨坦会议以及四国管制委员会作出的关于根除德国军国主义、实行土地改革和消灭垄断资本的决定。我们很明白，这种做法激怒了西德某些垄断资本家和地主，因此他们反对承认德意志民主共和国。
    但是，这丝毫没有使实际的事实改变，工农政权还是在成长和取得成就。
    现在，在德意志民主共和国，在和平民主的基础上生活的改造不可抗拒地向前发展，管制委员会的法律、指示和命令正在变得失效，人民的立法充分行使着它的权力，对于这些，德意志民主共和国的居民当然是欢迎的。而在西德，统治集团不顾大多数居民的意志，把西德同北大西洋公约连结在一起，并且在波恩急忙通过军事法律，这在恢复德国统一的问题上就形成了困难而复杂的局面。
    在我们这个具有如此重大意义的全面条约中说，德意志民主共和国和苏联无论是在为维护和巩固普遍和平和欧洲安全而进行合作方面，或者是为在重新使德国统一为一个和平民主的国家以及为和平协商解决德国问题方面所作的共同努力，都是符合德国人民和苏联人民的利益的，也同样是符合欧洲其他国家的人民的利益的。
    德国人民很感谢苏联最高苏维埃和部长会议以及布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志本人，因为他们在缓和国际紧张局势方面采取了主动。这也将使缓和德国的紧张局势成为可能。我们衷心欢迎德意志联邦共和国和苏联政府间关于建立外交关系和经济及文化合作的协议，因为这也有助于紧张局势的缓和而且可能有助于德国两个部分的修好。德国军国主义的复活显然是欧洲各国人民的和平生活的主要威胁。任何人都不能期望我们将使德国的复仇主义者能够采用一九三三年希特勒选举的故技来加强他们的地位，并且把他们的军事基地推进到奥得河边以便随后挑起一场战争。
    现在只有一条保卫欧洲和平和重新统一德国的道路，这条道路就是用一个所有欧洲国家之间的集体安全条约来打破欧洲的黩武主义的联盟。格罗提渥总理已经建议德国的两个部分进一步接近。德国两个部分的工人、劳动农民、工会、运动员和文化工作者之间的合作已经获得了令人满意的进展。由于两个德意志国家的政治和法律地位，两个国家都有必要互相承认并且解决直接存在在两个政府之间的各种问题。
    特别是从德意志民主共和国政府机构接管边境管理工作和穿过德意志民主共和国领土的西德和西柏林之间的交通管制工作以来，除了两个政府之间的正式谈判以外没有其他办法可以解决有争端的各项问题。波恩和西柏林的重要政界人士不能不承认通过冷战来颠覆德意志民主共和国的计划是注定要失败的，不论承认这一点是多么困难。他们承认得愈早，对于西柏林的居民说来就愈好。
    让西德联邦政府清醒地估计一下局势，并且认清它只能在西德联邦共和国中行使它的权利。它所发表的关于德国疆界的声明是没有价值的，因为存在着仍然有效的国际条约。
    我们同意苏联军队继续留在德意志民主共和国警卫和平。只要西方国家仍旧不打算从西德撤出它们的军队和取消它们的军事基地，苏联军队就有必要驻在德意志民主共和国的领土上。这并不影响工人和农民的政权通过他们自己的武装力量有效地保护劳动人民的祖国——德意志民主共和国的责任。在波恩通过军事法律和进行建立侵略性“国防军”的工作——这种工作已经开始——以后，德意志民主共和国将严格地执行由华沙条约所产生的它的义务和权利。
    新的全面条约——它表示德意志民主共和国发展中的一个新时期的开始——是以德国人民和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟各族人民间的巩固的不可侵犯的友谊为基础的。它建立了以平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政为基础的政治和法律关系，这种关系有利于德意志民主共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟间的友谊的进一步加强和扩大。整个这个条约将有助于我们两国间的经济、科学—技术和文化关系的进一步发展。同时，它将有助于加强民主和社会主义国家的阵营。
    我们希望牢固的友好关系将在全德人民与苏联之间发展起来。促成整个德国的问题的和平解决是我们的共同任务。德意志民主共和国的工人和农民政权感到自己有责任保卫全体德国人民的和平和民主利益，使他们的最高愿望——和平解决德国问题——得以实现。
    我们深信德国工人阶级，劳动农民，知识分子和一切其他爱好和平的德国人将从两次世界大战的灾难中吸取教训，并且将勇敢地选择为和平、民主和进步而斗争的道路。现在的全面条约将有助于加强德意志民主共和国的工人和农民的政权，从而有助于和平、民主和社会主义的伟大和正义的事业。
    亲爱的苏联朋友们，我们衷心地感谢你们在草拟同样地有利于我们两国人民的利益的全面新的条约时所给予我们的友好的合作。
