    Two Tractors Sleeping for a Year
    To the Editor:
    In July and August of last year, the state-owned Liangping Farm in Sichuan Province received two tractors one after the other. This good news made the vast number of peasants in the Wanxian Special District rejoice. However, a year has passed, and people have not heard any news of the tractors being put into production.

    Why have the tractors been left unused for so long at the Liangping Farm? The reason is that using tractors for plowing requires planning the site, leveling the land, and building machine rooms, machine roads, bridges, culverts, etc., and the farm does not have this funding. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry decided to allocate 10,000 yuan when it transferred these two tractors to the Liangping Farm. By early September of last year, the Liangping Farm, based on the autumn machine plowing plan approved by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, had drained the water from 650 mu of fields and was actively preparing for work; however, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry then refused to allocate the funds. At this time, although the farm transferred workers to level the land, more than 300 mu of fields were still dry-plowed by cattle for a month. It is estimated that the fertilizer efficiency in this part of the field was reduced by 25 to 30 percent, and the labor costs for transporting straw, fertilizer, etc., wasted 500 yuan.

    Tractors also require tractor implements and fuel. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry also promised to allocate these, but it never did. September was the perfect time for machine plowing, but because there were no plowshares and no fuel, the tractors had to be shut up in the house. Later, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry instructed the Liangping Farm to use four-furrow plows instead of five-furrow plows, and to solve the fuel problem themselves. By the time the farm sent people to buy back the fuel, the rainy season had arrived, and the tractors could no longer go into the fields.

    The Department of Agriculture and Forestry also "cared" about the tractor issue. In September of last year, when the farm was busy with production, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry made a long-distance call to the farm director, asking them to send someone with information and blueprints to the province within three days to study the machine plowing problem with the survey team leader. The farm director immediately sent someone to the province, but after waiting for more than twenty days, the reply was that "there is no time to study it now."

    Before this year's spring plowing, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry decided to establish a large-scale agricultural technology station and made several phone calls to urge it. Later, the agricultural technology station was established, and the tractors and machine operators were transferred to the leadership of the station, but strangely, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry did not approve it.

    Until May of this year, these two tractors had only plowed 45 mu of land and harrowed 76 mu, and the machine operators had been idle for a long time without work. What is particularly serious is that this situation has also made local farmers doubt the prospects of agricultural mechanization. I believe that the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry should conduct a review of their bureaucratic work style.

### 两台拖拉机睡了一年觉

    两台拖拉机睡了一年觉编辑同志：
    去年七、八月间，国营四川省梁平农场先后运来了两台拖拉机。这个喜讯，使万县专区的广大农民欢欣鼓舞。可是，一年过去了，人们还没有听到拖拉机投入生产的消息。
    为什么梁平农场有了拖拉机长期搁置不用呢？原来用拖拉机耕地需要规划场地、平整土地、修建机房、机道、桥梁、涵洞等，农场没有这笔经费。四川省农林厅在调拨这两台拖拉机给梁平农场的时候，曾决定拨给一万元的经费。到去年九月上旬，梁平农场根据农林厅同意的秋季机耕计划，将六百五十亩田里的水放干了，并且积极进行准备工作；农林厅却又不给拨经费了。这时农场虽然抽调了工人平整土地，但仍有三百多亩田干了一个月才用牛冬耕。估计这部分田中肥效损失百分之二十五到三十，搬运稻草、肥料等所用的工费就浪费了五百元。
    拖拉机还需要拖拉机农具和油料。农林厅开始也答应给调拨，但是一直没有照办。九月天气正好适宜机耕，因为没有犁铧，也没有油料，拖拉机只好关在屋里。后来省农林厅指示梁平农场以四铧犁代五铧犁，油料自行解决。等农场派人买回油来，雨季来了，拖拉机已不能下田了。
    农林厅也曾“关心”过拖拉机的问题。去年九月，场里生产正忙，农林厅打长途电话给农场场长，要他们派人带着资料、蓝图，随勘测队长在三天内赶到省里去研究机耕问题。场长马上派人赶到省里，结果等了二十多天，得到的答复说是“现在没空研究”。
    今年春耕前，农林厅决定成立大型农业技术站，曾几次打电话催促。后来农业技术站成立了，拖拉机和机务人员都调归站领导，但奇怪的是省农林厅又不批准了。
    直到今年五月为止，这两台拖拉机只耕地四十五亩，耙地七十六亩，机务人员长期闲着没有工作。特别严重的是，这种情况还使当地农民对农业机械化的前途发生了怀疑。我认为，四川省农林厅应该对他们的官僚主义作风进行检讨。
