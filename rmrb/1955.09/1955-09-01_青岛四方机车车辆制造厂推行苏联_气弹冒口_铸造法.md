Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant's Cangku Branch's Steel Casting Workshop has successfully tested the Soviet "Gas-Charged Riser" casting method. Since July of this year, the workshop has applied the Soviet "Gas-Charged Riser" casting method to the sand molds for large cast steel parts, locomotive driving wheel centers, and driven wheel centers, increasing steel utilization from 55% to over 82%, saving more than 320 tons of steel annually. From August 15th, the workshop began promoting this advanced casting method on large parts such as locomotive "crossheads."

In the past, when the Steel Casting Workshop cast large wheel center parts weighing over a ton each, each wheel center had a "large riser" weighing over 900 kilograms after casting. The "large riser" had to be cut off with gas welding, which not only wasted a lot of steel but also consumed a lot of gas welding materials and man-hours. Since the implementation of the Soviet "Gas-Charged Riser" casting method, "gas charges" have replaced a large amount of steel, eliminating four "small risers" and reducing the steel capacity of the "large riser," saving more than 440 kilograms of steel for each wheel center cast. In addition, it also ensured the quality of the castings, making the finished product rate reach 100%, and the workers' physical labor was also greatly reduced. (Li Hongqi)

    青岛四方机车车辆制造厂推行苏联“气弹冒口”铸造法
    青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂沧口分厂铸钢车间试行苏联“气弹冒口”铸造方法获得成功。从今年七月份起，这个车间在大型铸钢配件、机车主动轮心和他动轮心的铸造砂型上，运用了苏联“气弹冒口”铸造法，使钢水利用率从过去的百分之五十五提高到百分之八十二以上，全年能节约三百二十多吨钢水。从八月十五起，这个车间又在机车“十字头”等大型配件上，推广这种先进铸造方法。
    铸钢车间过去在铸造大型轮心等配件时，每个一吨多重的轮心在铸成后，就带着一个九百多公斤重的“大冒口”，必须用汽焊把“大冒口”割掉，不但损失大量钢水，而且还要消耗很多汽焊材料和工时。自从推行了苏联“气弹冒口”铸造法以后，用“气弹”代替了大量钢水，消除了四个“小冒口”，减少了“大冒口”的钢水容量，铸出每个轮心可以节省四百四十多公斤钢水。此外，还保证了铸件质量，使成品率达到百分之百，工人的体力劳动也减轻了很多。　（李鸿起）
