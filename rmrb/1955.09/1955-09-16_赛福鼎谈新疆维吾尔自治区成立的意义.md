Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 15th. On the eve of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Saifuddin (Uyghur), Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the significance of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

Saifuddin said: The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is a major victory in implementing the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the Xinjiang region. It is also another major political event for the Uyghur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who, with the help of the Han people, overthrew reactionary rule, freed themselves from national oppression and discrimination, and gained liberation. In the tragic past, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang suffered from the double oppression of Han rulers and rulers within their own ethnic groups for a long time. Only with the founding of the People's Republic of China could the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang truly live an equal, free, and happy life in the friendly and cooperative family of the motherland. In the short five years since liberation, Xinjiang's economic and cultural construction has made considerable progress. Land reform has been implemented in agricultural areas with a population of 3.5 million, and an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation is currently being carried out in these areas. Agricultural production cooperatives have grown to more than 1,700, and will expand to more than 10,000 by 1957. A considerable number of modern industries have emerged in the national economy, and livestock production has also developed well. Among the current population of more than four million in Xinjiang, there are nearly 400,000 students in primary schools, middle schools, and universities. After the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and based on the principle of being masters of their own affairs, managing the affairs of their own ethnic groups will better accelerate the speed of economic and cultural construction, and will gradually raise the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who have gained equal rights politically, to the level of advanced ethnic groups economically and culturally.

Saifuddin said: The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is also of great significance for consolidating unity among ethnic groups. Before liberation, due to the instigation of the reactionary ruling class, unity among the ethnic groups in Xinjiang was not good. In particular, there was estrangement and hostility between the various ethnic minorities and the Han people. After liberation, under the loving care of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, the old ethnic relations have been fundamentally changed, and new relations of mutual assistance and close friendship have begun to be established among the ethnic groups. After the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Uyghur people, who account for more than 74% of the total population of Xinjiang, must learn from the Han people's exemplary role in helping all ethnic minorities throughout the country, and proactively help other ethnic minorities within Xinjiang, so that the people of all ethnic groups can join hands more closely and jointly transition to socialist society.

    赛福鼎谈新疆维吾尔自治区成立的意义
    新华社乌鲁木齐十五日电　新疆维吾尔自治区的成立前夕，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、新疆省人民政府副主席赛福鼎（维吾尔族），对新华社记者谈了新疆维吾尔自治区成立的意义。
    赛福鼎说：新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，是新疆地区贯彻执行中国共产党、毛主席的民族政策的一个重大胜利。同时也是新疆维吾尔族和其他民族人民，在汉族人民帮助下，推翻反动统治、摆脱民族压迫和歧视、获得解放以后的又一个重大的政治事件。在过去悲惨的年代里，新疆各族人民曾经长期遭受汉族统治者和本民族内部统治者的双重残酷压迫，中华人民共和国的成立，新疆各族人民才能在友爱合作的祖国大家庭，真正过着平等、自由和幸福的生活。在解放以后短短的五年时间内，新疆的经济、文化建设已有较大的发展。在三百五十万人口的农业地区实行了土地改革，目前正在这些地区开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。农业生产合作社已发展到一千七百多个，到一九五七年就将发展到一万个以上。国民经济中已出现了相当数量的现代工业，畜牧业生产也有很好的发展。在新疆现有四百多万人口中，小学、中学和大学学生已近四十万人。新疆维吾尔自治区成立以后在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院领导下，根据当家作主的原则，管理本民族的事务，将会更好地加快经济、文化建设的速度，将把政治上获得了平等权利的新疆各民族，在经济和文化上也逐渐提高到先进民族的水平。
    赛福鼎说：新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，对巩固各民族间的团结也有极大的意义。解放前，由于反动统治阶级的挑拨，新疆各民族间团结是不好的。尤其是各少数民族和汉族间存在着隔阂和仇视。解放后，在各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席亲切关怀下，旧的民族关系已经从根本上改变了，各民族间开始建立了相互帮助、亲密友好的新关系。新疆维吾尔自治区成立后，占新疆总人口百分之七十四以上的维吾尔族人民，要好好学习汉族在全国范围内帮助各少数民族的模范榜样，主动地帮助新疆境内其他各少数民族，使得各民族人民更亲密地携起手来，共同过渡到社会主义社会。
