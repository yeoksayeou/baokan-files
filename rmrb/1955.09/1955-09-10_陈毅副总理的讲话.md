Dear Chargé d'Affaires, comrades and friends:

    Today is the glorious festival of the 11th anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria. On behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend heartfelt and fraternal congratulations to the government and people of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.
    Eleven years ago today, the heroic Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the help of the Soviet Union, launched an armed uprising, liberating their motherland from the enslavement of fascist Germany and domestic reactionaries, and seizing state power into their own hands. Over the past eleven years, the Bulgarian people have traversed a difficult and glorious path in the cause of building socialism. They have smashed the sabotage plots of enemies at home and abroad and consolidated the people's democratic system. With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people, after completing the two-year recovery plan, they completed the first five-year plan one year ahead of schedule with unparalleled labor enthusiasm, thereby laying a solid foundation for socialist construction. Now, the hardworking and brave Bulgarian people are confidently struggling to realize the second five-year plan. The unremitting efforts of the Bulgarian people to defend peace in Europe and the world have made a significant contribution to easing international tensions and safeguarding the security of Europe, especially the Balkans. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements of their fraternal Bulgarian people in building socialism and safeguarding world peace.
    In recent years, the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Bulgarian people has greatly developed. The Chinese people cherish this fraternal, eternal friendship, which is in the interests of the people of both China and Bulgaria and the people of all countries in the world, and are determined to make every effort to consolidate and develop this friendship.
    Dear comrades and friends, as we celebrate the glorious festival of the fraternal Bulgarian people with infinite excitement, we wish the Bulgarian people new achievements in building socialism and defending European and world peace. I propose:
    To the prosperity of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the happiness of its people,
    To the increasing consolidation and development of the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria,
    To world peace and friendship among the people of all countries,
    To the health of Comrade Chervenkov, the leader of the Bulgarian people!

    陈毅副总理的讲话亲爱的代办同志，同志们和朋友们：
    今天是保加利亚解放十一周年的光荣节日。我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向保加利亚人民共和国政府和人民致衷心的、兄弟的祝贺。
    十一年前的今天，英雄的保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在苏联的帮助下，举行了武装起义，把自己的祖国从法西斯德国和国内反动派的奴役下解放出来，把国家政权掌握在自己的手里。十一年来，保加利亚人民在建设社会主义的事业中经历了艰苦而光荣的道路。他们击破了国内外敌人的破坏阴谋，巩固了人民民主制度。他们在苏联人民兄弟般的援助下，在完成了两年恢复计划之后，又以无比的劳动热情提前一年完成了第一个五年计划，从而奠定了社会主义建设的巩固基础。现在，勤劳勇敢的保加利亚人民正满怀信心地为实现第二个五年计划而斗争。保加利亚人民为保卫欧洲和世界的和平所作出的不懈努力，对和缓国际紧张局势和维护欧洲、特别是巴尔干地区的安全有重大贡献。中国人民为自己兄弟的保加利亚人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业中所取得的巨大成就，感到欢欣鼓舞。
    几年以来，中保人民的友好合作有了很大的发展。中国人民十分珍贵这种兄弟的、永恒的、符合中保两国人民和世界各国人民利益的友谊，并决心为巩固和发展这种友谊作出一切努力。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，我们在怀着无限兴奋的心情欢庆兄弟的保加利亚人民光荣节日的时候，预祝保加利亚人民在建设社会主义和保卫欧洲和世界和平的事业中获得新的成就。我建议：
    为保加利亚人民共和国的繁荣和人民的幸福，
    为中保两国人民兄弟的友谊的日益巩固和发展，
    为世界和平和各国人民之间的友谊，
    为保加利亚人民领袖契尔文科夫同志的健康干杯！
