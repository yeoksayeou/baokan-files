Xinhua News Agency, September 6th, Prague dispatch from TASS: An air force review was held at Ruzyne Airport in Prague on September 4th to celebrate Czechoslovakian Aviation Day.

Tens of thousands of working people gathered at the airport. Participating in the review were leaders of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, representatives of the National Front and public organizations, military attachés of various countries stationed in Czechoslovakia, and air force delegations from Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.

As the review began, the lead plane flew across the sky. Subsequently, pilots from the Army and Air Force Promotion Association, glider pilots, and parachutists performed. The flight of the first helicopter designed in Czechoslovakia was greatly appreciated.

The performance of the air force pilots particularly attracted the attention of the audience. Leading the way was Air Force Officer Yelena Bozhova, the first female pilot in Czechoslovakia to master the flying techniques of jet fighters.

After the performance of nine jet aircraft, paratroopers demonstrated parachuting from fixed balloons and delayed parachuting. The two jumps performed by Air Force Officer Lukaschek aroused widespread interest; he discarded the first opened parachute and then opened the reserve parachute after falling several hundred meters.

Finally, several squadrons of twin-engine jet bombers, under the cover of fighters, carried out an "attack" on targets on the ground guarded by anti-aircraft guns. The "battle" ended when the paratroopers landed.

Subsequently, thirty-three bombers appeared in the air, forming the shape of a sickle and hammer, symbolizing the alliance of workers and peasants.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 4th, TASS dispatch: The Romanian people and their armed forces celebrated Aviation Day on September 4th. An aviation review was held at Baneasa Airport in Bucharest. Tens of thousands of working people from the capital and suburbs formed a semicircle around the airport.

Participating in the celebration were leaders of the Party and government, foreign envoys, and military attachés.

At the head of the reviewed flight formation were several aircraft carrying flags, flying the national flags of the Romanian People's Republic and the Soviet Union. Subsequently, groups of aircraft flew by, forming the shapes of stars and the word "Peace" in the azure sky.

Next, aviation sports athletes began to demonstrate their flying skills. They performed various aerobatic maneuvers. Following them were glider pilots and model aircraft builders.

The audience marveled at the high-altitude flying techniques performed by air force pilots in jet aircraft. The program concluded with a large-scale parachute landing performance.

    捷罗两国首都举行空军检阅
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社布拉格讯：九月四日，布拉格的鲁津机场举行了空军检阅，庆祝捷克斯洛伐克航空节。
    机场上聚集了成千成万的劳动人民。参加检阅的有捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的领导人，民族阵线和公众团体的代表，各国驻捷陆军和空军武官，以及波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的空军代表团。
    检阅开始时，领航机首先飞过天空。随后，陆军和空军促进协会的驾驶员、滑翔机驾驶员和跳伞运动员举行了表演。捷克斯洛伐克设计的第一架直升飞机的飞行受到了很大的赞赏。
    空军飞行员的表演特别受到观众的注意。带头的是空军军官叶列纳波乔娃，她是捷克斯洛伐克第一个掌握喷气式驱逐机的飞行技术的女飞行员。
    九架喷气式飞机表演后，伞兵表演了从固定气球上跳伞和延迟跳伞。空军军官卢卡舍克表演的两次跳伞引起了普遍的兴趣，他丢掉了第一个张开的降落伞，然后在降落几百公尺以后才又张开后备伞。
    最后，几小队双发动机型喷气式轰炸机在驱逐机掩护下对地上由高射炮守卫的目标进行了“袭击”。当伞兵着陆后，就结束了这次“战役”。
    随后，空中出现了三十三架轰炸机，它们组成了象征工农联盟的镰刀和锤子的队形状。
    据新华社讯　塔斯社布加勒斯特四日讯：罗马尼亚人民和他们的武装部队九月四日庆祝航空节。在布加勒斯特的贝尼亚萨飞机场上举行了航空检阅。首都和城郊的数万劳动人民在飞机场上围成了一个半圆形。
    参加庆祝典礼的有党和政府的领导人，各国使节，陆军和空军武官。
    受检阅飞行队伍的最前头是一些携带旗帜的飞机，这些飞机上飘扬着罗马尼亚人民共和国和苏联的国旗。随后飞来了一些机群，这些机群在蔚蓝色的天空中组成了星形和“和平”的字样。
    接着，航空体育运动员开始表演自己的飞行技巧。他们驾驶飞机表演各种花样的高度飞行技术。接着他们后面的是滑翔机驾驶员和模型飞机制造者。
    观众惊叹地注视着空军飞行员用喷气式飞机表演的高度飞行技术。节目的最后是大批降落伞的着陆表演。
