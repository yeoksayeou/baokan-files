    Overcome Bureaucracy, Prevent Embezzlement
    To the Editor:
    The Jinan Intermediate People's Court publicly tried an embezzlement case on August 14th—the Wang Zhengke embezzlement case.
    The major embezzler, Wang Zhengke, was an accountant at the Xuecheng Engineering Section of the Jinan Railway Bureau, and he consistently pursued a bourgeois, pleasure-seeking, and decadent lifestyle. On April 18, 1955, the accountant, Wei Fukui, entrusted him with the safekeeping of the seals of the section chief and the chief accountant; later, the cashier, Zhao Yuying, also handed him a book of bank checks. Thereupon, the criminal Wang secretly wrote a check for 23,469 yuan, claiming it was for advance payment of April wages and distribution of first-quarter bonuses. After work, he took a train to escape to Xuzhou, then transferred to Hankou. After arriving in Hankou, the criminal Wang used four aliases successively and stayed in seven hotels; he also sent a letter to the Urumqi Post Office in Xinjiang, entrusting the post office to send a letter back to the Xuecheng Engineering Section, falsely claiming that he had arrived in Urumqi in an attempt to escape the sanction of the law. However, no matter how cunning the embezzlers and thieves were, on May 9, 1955, the Xuzhou branch of the Jinan Railway Bureau Public Security Office finally detected the whereabouts of the major embezzler Wang Zhengke and captured him.
    This case was investigated and verified by the Jinan Railway Transportation Procuratorate, which filed a public prosecution with the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. After a public trial, the court held that Wang's crime was extremely serious. In order to uphold the sanctity of the law, protect state property from infringement, and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist construction cause, it was decided to sentence the criminal Wang to death, and the embezzled money and goods were recovered and returned to the original unit.
    Although the Wang Zhengke embezzlement case has been properly handled, there are many lessons to be learned from it.
    The reason why Wang Zhengke wanted to steal public funds was that he himself had serious bourgeois ideas of pursuing pleasure. However, the leadership of the Xuecheng Engineering Section of the Jinan Railway Bureau should be responsible for the realization of his theft. They failed to grasp Wang's ideological situation in a timely manner, and therefore, neither gave him the necessary education nor provided the necessary supervision. More seriously, the relevant leaders of the Xuecheng Engineering Section were extremely paralyzed in their thinking and neglected the financial and accounting system, directly giving Wang the opportunity to embezzle. The section chief had long entrusted his seal for bank deposits and withdrawals to the chief accountant for safekeeping, and when the chief accountant was on a business trip, he handed over the section chief's seal along with his own seal to the accountant Wei Fukui for safekeeping, and Wei Fukui casually allowed Wang to use these seals. In addition, when the cashier Zhao Yuying asked for leave on April 18th, she casually handed over the cash on hand and bank checks to Wang, which allowed the embezzler to exploit the loophole.
    Bureaucracy is a breeding ground for embezzlement! Countless facts in the Three-Anti Movement have proved that this is a lesson that must be firmly remembered. However, the leaders of some agencies have forgotten this serious lesson, so embezzlement incidents have been able to occur again and again. It is hoped that the Wang Zhengke embezzlement incident will awaken these people, quickly overcome the bureaucratic work style, strictly implement the financial system, and resolutely block all loopholes in the work, so as to prevent state property from continuing to be stolen by embezzlers.

### 克服官僚主义，防止贪污事件

    克服官僚主义，防止贪污事件编辑同志：
    济南市中级人民法院在八月十四日公审了一个贪污案件——王正珂贪污案。
    大贪污犯王正珂是济南铁路管理局薛城工务段的会计员，一贯追求资产阶级享乐腐化生活。一九五五年四月十八日，会计员魏福奎将段长和总会计的图章交给他代管；后来出纳员赵玉英又把银行支票一本也交给了他。于是，王犯就偷偷开了二万三千四百六十九元的支票一张，以借支四月份工资和发放第一季度奖金为名，到薛城县人民银行如数提出现金，下班后就乘车逃往徐州，再转到汉口。王犯到达汉口后，曾先后使用假名四个，住过旅馆七处；并且发信给新疆乌鲁木齐市邮局，委托邮局把一封信寄回薛城工务段，扬言他已到乌鲁木齐市，企图逃脱国法的制裁。但是，不管贪污盗窃分子怎样狡诈，一九五五年五月九日，济南铁路管理局公安处徐州分处终于侦悉了大贪污犯王正珂的行踪，将他捕获归案了。
    这个案件经济南铁路运输检察院侦查属实，向济南市中级人民法院提起公诉。法院进行公开审理后，认为王犯的罪行极为严重。为严肃国法，保护国家财产不受侵犯，保障社会主义建设事业顺利进行，决定判处王犯死刑，赃款、赃物追缴归还原单位。
    王正珂贪污案虽然已经得到应有的处理，但是其中有很多教训是值得我们吸取的。
    王正珂之所以要盗窃公款，是由于他本人存在着严重的资产阶级贪图享乐的思想。但是，他的盗窃行为所以能够实现，济南铁路管理局薛城工务段领导方面是应该负责的。他们对于王犯的思想情况没有及时地掌握，因此，既不对他进行必要的教育，也没有给以必要的监督。更严重的是，薛城工务段有关领导人员思想上极端麻痹，忽视财务会计制度，直接使王犯得到了进行贪污的机会。工务段段长长期把自己用于银行存款支款的印鉴交给总会计保管，总会计出差时又把段长的印鉴连同自己的印鉴一并交给会计员魏福奎代管，魏福奎又把这些印鉴随便让王犯使用，再加上四月十八日出纳员赵玉英请假时又随手把库存现金和银行支票交给了王犯，以致被贪污分子钻了空子。
    官僚主义是贪污行为的温床！三反运动中的无数事实证明了这是一条必须牢牢记住的教训。但是，有些机关的领导人员竟然把这个严重的教训忘记了，因而贪污事件又得以一再出现。希望王正珂贪污事件能够使这些人惊醒起来，迅速克服工作中的官僚主义作风，严格地执行财政制度，坚决堵塞工作中的一切漏洞，以免使国家财产继续被贪污分子所盗窃。
