Seven young workers at the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, namely, lathe operators Yu Zhenhua and Liu Miaofa, fitters Tian Daihe and Fu Maoxing, foundry worker Chen Hongsheng, gear hobber Li Huashan, and thread roller Zhang Hanji, have completed their entire 1955 workload ahead of schedule. The quality of their products all meet the standards set by the state. On September 1st, the plant's Communist Youth League organization held a plant-wide youth worker meeting to reward these seven young workers and called on all young workers in the plant to learn from them.
    These seven young workers have all been able to learn humbly in their work, continuously improve their techniques, and increase labor productivity. For example, lathe operator Liu Miaofa improved his lathe tools and operating methods between July and August this year, increasing his work efficiency by 30% to 100%. He completed his entire year's workload five months and fifteen days ahead of schedule. Thread roller Zhang Hanji continuously improved the positioning frame on the thread rolling machine and the automatic calculator on the punch press, increasing work efficiency by two to three times. He completed his entire year's workload four months and seven days ahead of schedule.

    上海机床厂七个青年工人提前完成今年全年工作量
    国营上海机床厂青年车工俞振华、刘妙发，钳工田戴和、傅茂兴，铸工陈洪声，滚齿工李华山，滚丝工张汉基等七人，已经提前完成一九五五年全年的工作量，产品质量都达到国家规定的指标。九月一日，这个工厂的青年团组织召开了全厂青年工人大会，奖励这七个青年工人，并号召全厂青年工人向他们学习。
    这七个青年工人在工作中都能够虚心学习，不断改进技术，提高劳动生产率。例如车工刘妙发在今年七八月间改进了车刀和操作方法，使工作效率提高百分之三十到一百。他已经提前五个月零十五天完成了全年工作量。滚丝工张汉基连续改进滚丝机上的定位架和冲床自动计算器，提高工作效率一倍到三倍。他已经提前四个月零七天完成了全年工作量。
