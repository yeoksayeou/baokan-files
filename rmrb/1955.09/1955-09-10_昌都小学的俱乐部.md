Changdu Elementary School established a club in February of this year to better implement the educational policy of cultivating children's all-round development.

The children love their club, and they have decorated the club's rooms very beautifully. In the center of the wall hangs portraits of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhu, with pictures about production and construction posted on both sides; slogans such as "Protect Public Property," "Unite and Love Each Other," and "Study Diligently" are posted on the pillars. The club also has more than 200 Tibetan and Chinese books and newspapers, more than 100 picture magazines about industrial and agricultural production, and a variety of recreational items. Every day, many children come here to read books, newspapers, and picture magazines. The club is also managed by the children themselves, who have come up with some management methods to run the club in an organized manner.

The club has groups for dancing, drama, and ball games. During their spare time after class, the children often perform dances and play games together. During the commemoration of the "May Fourth" Youth Day and the welcoming of the Dalai Lama back to Tibet, they also performed many wonderful programs.

The various activities organized by the club have aroused the children's interest in reading books and newspapers and participating in recreational activities. Every day after school, or on Sundays, the children often run to the Xinhua Bookstore's book and newspaper sales department to look at Tibetan picture magazines, and some even buy comic books depicting the heroic deeds of Zoya, Huang Jiguang, and other heroes to take home and read.

The children all realize that the happy life they have today was brought to them by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Luo Sang Gangda, a primary school student, wrote on the club's blackboard newspaper: "The Communist Party is like a mountain, evergreen for ten thousand years; Chairman Mao's kindness is like river water, flowing endlessly forever."

    昌都小学的俱乐部
    李永寿
    昌都小学为了更好地贯彻培养儿童全面发展的教育方针，在今年二月间成立了俱乐部。
    孩子们热爱自己的俱乐部，他们把俱乐部的房子布置得很漂亮。正中的墙壁上挂着毛主席和朱副主席的肖像，两旁贴上关于生产建设的图画；柱子上贴着“爱护公物”、“团结友爱”、“认真学习”等标语。俱乐部里还有两百多册藏、汉文书籍和报纸，一百多册有关工农业生产方面的画刊和多种多样的娱乐用品。每天，有许多孩子来这里阅读书刊和画报。管理俱乐部的也是儿童，他们想出了一些管理的办法，把俱乐部办得有条有理。
    俱乐部设有舞蹈、戏剧和球类等小组。课余的时候，孩子们常在一起表演舞蹈、游戏。在纪念“五四”青年节和欢迎达赖喇嘛回西藏时，他们还表演了很多精彩的节目。
    俱乐部组织的各种活动，引起了孩子们阅读书报和参加文娱活动的兴趣。每天放学以后，或者是星期天，孩子们常常跑到新华书店的图书报刊门市部去看藏文画报，有的还购买画着卓娅、黄继光等英雄事迹的连环画册，带回家去阅读。
    孩子们都认识到今天这样幸福的生活是共产党和毛主席带给他们的，小学生罗桑刚达在俱乐部的黑板报上写道：“共产党像山一样，万年长青；毛主席的恩情像河水一样，永远流不尽”。
