    Fuxin Expands Xinqiu Mine North Open-Pit Mine
    The expansion of the North Open-Pit Mine of the Xinqiu Mine in Fuxin Coal Mine has begun. After the expansion, the area of this mine will nearly double. The coal reserves in the expanded area are very rich and very close to the surface. In some places, black-purple coal lines have already been exposed, and underneath is coal.
    The North Open-Pit Mine was originally started during the period of Japanese puppet rule, but at that time only two ditches were dug and it was not completed. After liberation, the workers continued construction using old Japanese-style electric shovels, and coal was officially produced in 1950. So far, the coal reserves under the original mine are almost exhausted. The builders are making full use of the original factory buildings and mechanical equipment of the North Open-Pit Mine for expansion, which can save a lot of investment compared to building a new open-pit mine of the same scale.
    The expansion of the North Open-Pit Mine is one of the important measures for the Fuxin Mining Bureau to realize its first five-year plan. Next year, this new mine will officially produce coal. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 阜新扩建新邱矿北露天矿场

    阜新扩建新邱矿北露天矿场
    阜新煤矿新邱矿北露天矿场已开始扩建。这个矿场经扩建后，面积将扩大近一倍。扩建区域内煤的藏量很丰富，而且离地面很近，有的地方已露出黑紫色的煤线，底下就是煤了。
    北露天矿场原是日伪统治时期开始建设的，但当时只挖了两条土沟，没有建成。解放以后，工人们利用日本式的旧电铲，继续建设，在一九五零年正式开始出煤。到目前止，原有矿场底下的煤藏量已快要采完。建设者们充分利用北露天矿场原有的厂房和机械设备进行扩建，这样就可比新建同样规模的露天矿场节省很多投资。
    北露天矿场的扩建是阜新矿务局实现第一个五年计划的重要措施之一。明年，这个新矿场就将正式出煤。　（新华社）
