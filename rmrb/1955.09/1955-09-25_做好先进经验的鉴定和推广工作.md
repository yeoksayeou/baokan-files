    Do a good job in identifying and promoting advanced experiences
    Huang Sha
    The Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Promotion of Advanced Experience Working Committee and the Harbin Municipal Construction Trade Union have recently registered, sorted out, and appraised the advanced experiences in basic construction created by basic construction workers and technicians in Harbin since 1951. This is of great benefit to how to promote different advanced experiences according to different types of work in basic construction in the future, in order to ensure quality and complete the state's basic construction tasks ahead of schedule.
    Since the country entered socialist construction, the large-scale construction tasks have increasingly fallen on the shoulders of tens of thousands of construction workers and technicians in Harbin. In order to complete the tasks given by the state, they have created many new working methods. Since 1951, Harbin has successively seen the "segmented continuous bricklaying method" and "double-handed mortar squeezing method" created by bricklayer Su Changyou; the "plastering assembly line operation method" created by plasterer Yang Dezhong; the "carpentry assembly line operation method" created by carpenter Xie Wanfu; and many advanced construction experiences in construction management. These advanced experiences have greatly improved work efficiency. Su Changyou's team learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and created the "segmented continuous bricklaying method." Later, they further learned the bricklaying method of the Soviet Stakhanovite worker Shavlyugin and implemented the "double-handed mortar squeezing method," which fundamentally reformed the old Chinese bricklaying operation method. At that time, the general situation on the construction sites in Harbin was: the quality of the project was low, the amount of bricklaying by workers did not reach the quota, and each person could only lay eight or nine hundred bricks per day, and the highest did not exceed one thousand bricks. After Su Changyou's "double-handed mortar squeezing method" was promoted on various construction sites, it significantly improved work efficiency. For example, at that time, on the construction site of the Mechanical Factory No. 14, six bricklaying teams and one hundred and thirty bricklayers learned the "double-handed mortar squeezing method," and the average amount of bricklaying per person per day reached one thousand six hundred bricks, which enabled the entire project to be completed twenty days ahead of schedule.
    Inspired by the advanced experiences created by Su Changyou, Xie Wanfu, Yang Dezhong, and others, basic construction workers and technicians in Harbin also actively looked for shortcuts, came up with ideas, and created many new operation methods and advanced tools. For example, the bricklaying team of Zhang Ruiji of the Northeast First Engineering Company, after learning Su Changyou's "segmented continuous bricklaying method," created the advanced experience of "three stretchers and one header," which pushed Su Changyou's advanced method forward. Plumbers Shao Hongyu and Pan Hongjun created the "parallel assembly line operation method" for prefabricated plumbing installation, brick stacker Wang Guixiang created the "five-five horizontal and vertical stacking method," and carpenter Liu Cunxin created the "marking machine" and other advanced experiences and tools. These advanced experiences and tools have played a significant role in construction.
    However, these advanced experiences in the past have been scattered on various construction sites, and there has been no dedicated organization responsible for promotion. It was only relying on trade union workers to promote them. Because most trade union workers do not understand technology, they often promote blindly, so that some workers do not know which types of work have created which advanced experiences, what are the characteristics of those experiences, what are the shortcomings, etc.; each construction site does its own thing, and they do not communicate with each other. Many advanced experiences and advanced tools are very similar. For example, there are twelve kinds of marking tools for carpenters, and fifteen kinds of steel bar "bending tools" for steel workers. Because these advanced experiences and tools have not been specially organized for research, summarization, review, and appraisal, everyone is competing to manufacture or promote the advanced tools and methods of their own unit, resulting in a great waste of manpower and material resources. For example, the mortar spreader used in Su Changyou's "double-handed mortar squeezing method" was blindly manufactured by various construction sites in many different specifications, and as a result, many were not suitable for use. Furthermore, regarding Su Changyou's "segmented continuous bricklaying method" and "double-handed mortar squeezing method," because many construction sites did not understand the purpose of these two experiences, and did not apply his experience according to different situations, they one-sidedly believed that promoting the "double-handed mortar squeezing method" was promoting Su Changyou's experience. In fact, the main advantage of the "segmented continuous bricklaying method" is that the labor organization is reasonable, and it is suitable for all projects. The "double-handed mortar squeezing method" requires workers with a certain level of technical skill to master it well, and it has limitations. If it is promoted indiscriminately, the advanced experience will not be able to play its due role.
    Now, through this appraisal, the Harbin Municipal Basic Construction Promotion of Advanced Experience Working Committee and the Harbin Municipal Construction Trade Union have used the method of learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses to comprehensively organize, eliminate, and summarize the one hundred and eight advanced working methods and advanced tools scattered on various construction sites in the city in the past into fifty advanced experiences with the highest efficiency and universal significance. For example, among the fifteen kinds of marking tools for carpenters, some can improve work efficiency by six times, while others can only improve work efficiency by 30%. It has now been decided to promote the marking machine that can improve work efficiency by six times. Shao Hongyu, a plumber, created the "three-dimensional rapid construction method for prefabricated plumbing," and Pan Hongjun, a plumber, created the "parallel assembly line operation method." In the past, these were promoted separately, and they did not learn from each other. This time, they have also been organized into a complete rapid construction experience for plumbers.
    Through this research, summarization, review, appraisal, and promotion of advanced experiences, all employees have clearly understood how many experiences there are for each type of work, and the uses of various advanced experiences in each construction procedure. In construction, they can apply various advanced experiences according to the construction procedures and requirements, overcoming the waste of manpower and material resources caused by blindly calling for the promotion of advanced experiences in the past.
    Now, the Harbin Municipal Construction Trade Union is requiring the trade union organizations of various construction and installation units to, according to the tasks and construction procedures and characteristics of the grassroots construction units of the company, mobilize all employees to learn and promote various advanced experiences in a planned and organized manner, and will also hold professional type of work advanced experience exchange meetings and organize relevant units to visit on-site. On August 22, the Municipal Construction Trade Union organized employees from various construction sites to visit the experience of Shao Hongyu's plumbing prefabricated installation assembly line operation method at the Harbin Normal College construction site of the Third Engineering Zone of the Harbin Municipal Engineering Company. In July and August, the Wang Qingting team of the first work section of this construction site applied the appraised plumbing installation experiences of Shao Hongyu, Pan Hongjun, and others, so that the project, which originally required eighteen workers and seventy-five days to complete, was completed with only twelve workers and fifty-eight days, and work efficiency increased by an average of 27% compared to the past. Visitors all believe that this method of organizing, appraising various advanced experiences, and organizing on-site visits can learn from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses and jointly improve labor productivity.

    做好先进经验的鉴定和推广工作
    黄沙
    哈尔滨市基本建设推广先进经验工作委员会和哈尔滨市建筑工会，最近登记、整理和鉴定了一九五一年以来哈尔滨市基本建设工人和技术人员所创造的基本建设先进经验。这对于今后在基本建设方面如何根据不同工种、推广不同的先进经验，以保证质量、提前完成国家基本建设任务，有很大的好处。
    从国家进入社会主义建设以来，大规模的建设任务日益繁重地落在哈尔滨市几万建筑工人和技术人员的身上。他们为了完成国家所给予的任务，创造了许多新的工作方法。从一九五一年起，哈尔滨市先后出现了瓦工苏长有创造的“分段连续砌砖法”、“双手挤浆法”；抹灰工杨德重创造的“抹灰流水作业法”；木工谢万福创造的“木工流水作业法”和施工管理方面的许多先进施工经验。这些先进经验大大提高了工作效率。苏长有小组学习了苏联先进经验，创造了“分段连续砌砖法”，以后又进一步学习苏联斯达哈诺夫工作者沙夫留金的砌砖方法，实行“双手挤浆法”，对中国旧的砌砖操作方法起了根本的改革作用。当时哈尔滨各工地普遍的情况是：工程质量低劣，工人的砌砖量达不到定额，每人每天只能砌八、九百块砖，最高的也不超过一千块砖。苏长有创造的“双手挤浆法”在各工地推广后，就显著地提高了工作效率。如当时机械十四厂工地上，有六个瓦工小组、一百三十名瓦工学习了“双手挤浆法”后，每人每天的砌砖量平均达到一千六百块，使整个工程提前二十天完成。
    在苏长有、谢万福、杨德重等创造先进经验的启示下，哈尔滨市的基本建设工人和技术人员也纷纷找窍门、想办法、创造了许多新的操作方法和先进工具。如东北第一工程公司张瑞吉瓦工小组，学习了苏长有“分段连续砌砖法”后，又创造了“三顺一丁”先进经验，把苏长有的先进方法向前推进了一步。水暖工人邵洪玉、潘洪钧创造了水暖预制安装的“平行流水作业法”、码坯工王桂香创造的“五五横顺码架法”、木工刘存心创造的“划线机”等先进经验和先进工具。这些先进经验和工具，在施工中都起了很大的作用。
    但是，过去出现的这些先进经验，一直分散在各工地，没有专门负责推广的组织机构，只是依靠工会工作人员宣传推广。由于大部分工会工作人员不懂技术，往往盲目推广，以致有些工人不知道哪一工种已经创造出来了哪些先进经验以及那些经验有什么特点，有什么缺点等；各工地自搞一套，互不通气，很多先进经验和先进工具都是大同小异的。如木工的划线工具就出现了十二种，钢筋工的钢筋“围弯器”就出现了十五种。这些先进经验和工具，由于没有专门组织研究、总结、审查和鉴定，大家互相争着制造或推广本单位的先进工具和先进方法，人力、物力上的浪费很大。如苏长有“双手挤浆法”用的铺灰器，各个工地都盲目制造了不少规格不同的铺灰器，结果很多不合使用。又如苏长有创造的“分段连续砌砖法”和“双手挤浆法”，因很多工地不了解这两种经验的用途，没有根据不同情况运用他的经验，片面地以为推广“双手挤浆法”就是推广苏长有的经验了。其实“分段连续砌砖法”主要的优点是劳动组织合理，适用于一切工程。“双手挤浆法”就需要具有一定技术水平的工人才能掌握得好，带有局限性。如果不加区别地推广，就会使先进经验不能起它应有的作用。
    现在，哈尔滨市基本建设推广先进经验工作委员会和哈尔滨市建筑工会通过这次鉴定，把过去分散在全市各个工地上的一百零八件先进工作法和先进工具，用取长补短的办法，加以综合整理、淘汰、归纳成为五十件效率最高的有普遍意义的先进经验。如木工的十五种划线工具中，有的能提高工作效率六倍，有的只能提高工作效率百分之三十，现在决定推广能提高工作效率六倍的划线机。水暖工邵洪玉创造的“水暖预制立体快速施工法”和水暖工潘洪钧创造的“平行流水作业法”，过去都是各自推广，互不学习，这次也把它整理成为一个完整的水暖工快速施工经验。
    通过这次对先进经验的研究、总结、审查、鉴定和推广，使全体职工都明确了每个工种有多少经验，各种先进经验在每个施工程序上的用途，在施工中就能按施工程序、要求，运用各种先进经验，克服了过去由于盲目号召推广先进经验而造成人力、物力上的浪费。
    现在，哈尔滨市建筑工会正要求各建筑安装单位的工会组织，根据本公司基层施工单位的任务和施工程序、施工特点，有计划有领导地发动全体职工学习和推广各种先进经验，并将举办专业工种先进经验交流会，组织有关单位实地参观。市建筑工会已在八月二十二日组织各工地职工参观了哈尔滨市工程公司第三工区哈尔滨市师范专科学校工地邵洪玉水暖预制安装流水作业法经验。这个工地一工段王庆廷小组在七、八月间运用了已鉴定的邵洪玉、潘洪钧等水暖安装经验，使原来需要十八个工人、七十五天才能完成的工程，只用了十二个工人、五十八天就完成了，工作效率比过去平均提高了百分之二十七。参观者都认为这样整理、鉴定各种先进经验并组织实地参观的作法，可以取长补短，共同提高劳动生产率。
