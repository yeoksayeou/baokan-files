    The Great Festival of the Bulgarian People
    By Bulgarian Writer Mi Isayev
    September 9th is the great festival of the Bulgarian people. Eleven years ago on this day, the Soviet liberation army entered our country and liberated the Bulgarian people from fascist enslavement. The royal fascist dictatorship was completely crushed. In the early days of liberation in 1944, our country was scarred and exhausted by domestic and foreign capitalists. At that time, Bulgaria was a country with backward agriculture, no heavy industry, and no prospects for great development. After liberation, for the first time in thousands of years, the Bulgarian people began to build their new life without capitalists and plunderers.
    Today, our people are firmly advancing along a new and bright road towards the great goal of building a socialist society. In the past eleven years, we have eliminated the backwardness of our country and taken a big step forward. Ten years ago, in the fertile fields of Bulgaria, only lonely farmers were weakly cultivating with ancient plows and harrows. Today, most of them have been organized and embarked on the road of collectivization. More than 16,000 tractors and 2,600 combine harvesters shipped from the Soviet Union are working day and night in the fields.
    Near the ancient Maritsa River in southern Bulgaria, a huge chemical fertilizer factory has been built, and some of its products have been sold to fraternal China. The "Lenin" National Metallurgical Plant, newly built near our capital, has produced Bulgaria's own steel. Hundreds of other factories, power stations, dams, railways, mines, residences, schools, and sports fields have been built in new cities and villages in recent years.
    Profound revolutions have also taken place in the cultural field of the Bulgarian people. Education, science, and art are developing unprecedentedly. Among the more than seven million Bulgarian people, more than one million young citizens are studying in primary schools, middle schools, and universities. Illiteracy has been eradicated among people under the age of fifty throughout the country. More than one million copies of newspapers and periodicals are sold daily across Bulgaria. Hundreds of thousands of literary and scientific works are popular among people of all strata. Countless new theaters, opera houses, and cinemas have opened throughout the country. Amateur cultural activities are being carried out on an unprecedented scale.
    Whether young or old, our people are eager to acquire knowledge and hope to appreciate rich new art that can reflect the truth, goodness, and beauty of life and inspire heroic deeds. The new life gives scientists and artists an incomparably rich source of inspiration for engaging in great and moving creations.
    The reason why the people can exert unprecedented creativity in material and cultural aspects is because they feel that they are the masters of their own destiny, the masters of all wealth, and the masters of the future.
    In addition, there is a great inspiring force, without which the Bulgarian people would not be able to realize this profound transformation that guarantees their happiness. This force is the Bulgarian Communist Party. Our people feel fortunate and proud that this heroic party has produced a figure like the great Georgi Dimitrov.
    There is another great force, without which our great achievements in the past eleven years would also be unimaginable. This is our brotherly country—the Soviet Union. In our material and cultural fields, there is no place where Soviet assistance does not play a decisive role. This is why our people are so grateful to the Soviet Union.
    Today, our country, which is advancing towards socialism, is enjoying the happiness of peace, and peace is as necessary to our country as sunshine and air are to people. The people of our country have experienced many wars and have learned how to distinguish between friends and enemies, how to hate the instigators of imperialist wars, and how to fight heroically for peace.
    Our people are proud that Bulgaria, such a small country, has also become an equal member of the democratic and socialist family with nearly one billion people. Our people look forward to the future bravely and confidently, because they know that the Soviet people and the 600 million Chinese people are an invincible force of friendship. The young border guards on our southern border feel proud and confident because they know that the eastern frontier of the democratic camp—the Pacific coast—is defended by the fearless Chinese army.
    The Bulgarian people have warm, fraternal feelings for the great Chinese people who are far away. Every achievement of the People's Republic of China in building a new life fills the Bulgarian people with joy.
    Today, when the Bulgarian working people celebrate our National Day, they are proud of their responsibility to the socialist family and proud of having thousands of labor heroes as the pillars of our young country.
    When the Bulgarian people celebrate their great National Day, they express their deep friendship and respect to all neighboring and distant peoples who are fighting heroically for survival in freedom, peace, and mutual trust. (Attached photo)

    保加利亚人民的伟大节日
    保加利亚作家  米·伊萨耶夫
    九月九日是保加利亚人民的伟大节日。十一年前的这一天，苏联解放大军进入了我国国境，把保加利亚人民从法西斯奴役下解放出来。保皇法西斯独裁制度被彻底粉碎了。在一九四四年解放初期，我国满目创伤，被国内和外国资本家们剥削得民穷财尽。当时的保加利亚是这样的一个国家：农业落后，没有重工业，也没有什么巨大发展的远景。解放以后，保加利亚人民千年来第一次在没有资本家和掠夺者的情况下，开始建设他们的新生活。
    今天，我国人民正坚定地沿着一条新的光明大道向着建设社会主义社会的远大目标前进。十一年来，我们已经扫除了我国的落后现象并向前迈进了一大步。十年前，在保加利亚的肥沃田野里，只有孤零零的农民乏力地用古老的犁耙在耕作，今天，他们大部分都已经组织起来，走上了合作化的道路。由苏联运来的一万六千多架拖拉机和两千六百多架谷物联合收割机在田野里不分昼夜地工作着。
    在保加利亚南部古老的马里察河附近，已经建立起一座巨大的化学肥料工厂，这里的一部分产品已经远销到了兄弟的中国。我国首都附近新建成的“列宁”国家冶金工厂，已经炼出了保加利亚自己的钢。数以百计的其他工厂、电力站、水坝、铁路、矿山、住宅、学校和运动场在新的城市和乡村中在最近几年建立起来了。
    深刻的革命，也同样发生在保加利亚人民的文化领域里。教育、科学和艺术正在空前地发展着。七百多万保加利亚人民中，有一百万以上的青年公民在小学、中学和大学里学习。在全国五十岁以内的人民中间文盲已经绝迹。保加利亚每天约有一百多万份报纸和期刊销行到全国各地。数十万册文学和科学著作流行在各阶层人民之中。无数新的戏院、歌剧院和电影院在全国各地开放。业余文艺活动正在空前地开展。
    不论我国的青年或老年人，都渴望获得知识，希望欣赏能够反映生活的真、善、美和鼓舞英勇行为的、丰富的新艺术。新的生活给予科学家和艺术家们以从事伟大和动人创作的无比丰富的灵感。
    人民在物质和文化方面所以能够发挥空前的创造力，是由于他们感到他们是自己命运的主人，他们是一切财富的主人，他们是未来的主人。
    此外还有一个伟大的鼓舞力量，没有它保加利亚人民就不能够实现保证他们幸福的这个深刻的变革。这个力量就是保加利亚共产党。我国人民以这个英勇的党产生了像伟大的格奥尔基·季米特洛夫这样的人物而感到幸运和骄傲。
    还有另外一个伟大的力量，没有它我们过去十一年里的伟大成就也是不可想像的。这就是我们的兄弟国家——苏联。在我们的物质和文化领域中，没有一处苏联的援助不在起着决定性的作用。这就是何以我国人民都对苏联怀着十分感激的心情。
    今天，我们向着社会主义前进的国家，正在享受着和平的幸福，而和平对于我们的国家就像阳光和空气对于人那样的需要。我国人民经历了许多次战争，已经懂得如何区分朋友和敌人，懂得如何痛恨帝国主义战争挑拨者以及如何为和平而英勇斗争。
    我国人民以保加利亚这样一个小国也成为拥有将近十亿人口的民主和社会主义大家庭中平等的一员而感到骄傲。我国人民勇敢而满怀信心地展望着未来，因为他们知道，苏联人民和六亿中国人民是一个不可战胜的友谊力量。我国南部国境上的年轻的边防军们感到骄傲和自信，因为他们知道民主阵营的东部边疆——太平洋沿岸是由无畏的中国军队保卫着的。
    保加利亚人民对远在万里以外的伟大中国人民怀着热烈的兄弟般的感情。中华人民共和国在建设新生活中的每一项成就，都使保加利亚人民感到满心喜悦。
    保加利亚劳动人民今天在庆祝我国国庆的时候，以自己对社会主义大家庭负有责任而自豪，并且以拥有成千劳动英雄作为我们年轻的国家的支柱而自豪。
    保加利亚人民在庆祝他们的伟大国庆节日的时候，对所有为在自由、和平与互相信任中生存而英勇斗争着的邻国和远方人民，表示深厚的友谊的敬意。（附图片）
