    Using Mud as a Substitute for Rice Paste in Silk Fabric Printing
    To the Editor:
    Currently, silk fabric printing generally uses glutinous rice and rice bran for the ground paste, which consumes a large amount of industrial grain. Following the government's call for grain conservation, the Shanghai Private Guanghua Printing Factory, with the support and assistance of the China Silk Corporation Shanghai Branch, experimented with using mud to replace the glutinous rice and bran powder in the printing ground paste. After more than thirty repeated experiments, this method has been successful. In May, the georgette produced using 50% to 60% mud paste to replace glutinous rice paste met all quality standards.
    After the successful creation of using mud instead of glutinous rice paste for printing ground paste, it has been gradually promoted in various printing factories in Shanghai. In the June processing tasks, in addition to Guanghua Printing Factory continuing to conduct color sample trials, Da Kang Printing Factory also conducted trials on two kinds of silk fabrics, produced samples, and produced more than 180 rolls; other printing factories are also actively conducting sampling work one after another. From July, Shanghai printing factories began to use mixed mud paste to produce large quantities of silk fabrics, producing 8,684 rolls of silk fabrics, accounting for 82.2% of the printed silk fabrics entrusted by the Shanghai Silk Branch to various factories for processing. In August, all Shanghai export-oriented patterned silk fabrics were produced using mixed paste.
    The adoption of substitutes for industrial grain can save a large amount of grain. According to preliminary statistics, the use of mixed mud paste for Shanghai's export-oriented silk fabrics this year will save the country 400,000 catties of glutinous rice and nearly 10,000 catties of bran powder. Because mud is abundant and inexpensive, it can also greatly reduce printing costs. This good method of saving grain deserves to be widely promoted in printing factories everywhere.

    Reducing Alcohol Consumption, Saving Grain
    To the Editor:
    Our Hengyang Public-Private Joint Venture Huaxin Pharmaceutical Factory specializes in extracting domestic medicinal materials. Products, other than tablets, powders, and water-soluble products, all require alcohol as a raw material. We consume more than 10,000 catties of alcohol each month, which requires 50,000 catties of grain to brew. In June, under the call of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the workers worked hard to reduce alcohol consumption, saving a batch of grain for the country.
    We minimize the alcohol content of our products as much as possible without compromising product quality. For example, when extracting white peony root, it originally required five times the amount of alcohol to seep, but with careful operation by the workers, four times the amount of alcohol is sufficient; for extracting purple gromwell, it originally required 60-degree alcohol, but now 40-degree alcohol will do. In the past, when seeping a product, in addition to the multiple of alcohol that the product should use, one to three times the amount of mixing alcohol was added. Now, after research by the workers, the alcohol used for mixing can be completely saved. In the past, six times the amount of alcohol should have been used for seeping chrysanthemum, and another three times the amount of alcohol should have been added for mixing. If 500 catties of chrysanthemum were seeped every day, more than 166 catties of alcohol would be wasted.
    In the past, due to not strictly following operating procedures, a lot of alcohol was also wasted in the "dilution" aspect. According to regulations, fluid extracts should not be "diluted," and each catty of raw medicine should make 500 cubic centimeters of finished medicine, its initial liquid should contain 85%, and the subsequent liquid should contain 15%. However, due to lax operation, the subsequent liquid was not drained sufficiently, often differing by 10% to 15%, so that another 10% to 15% of alcohol had to be added for "dilution," resulting in serious waste. A batch of ephedra fluid extract made not long ago wasted 36,900 cubic centimeters of alcohol because of this.
    Now that the workers in our factory have put forward improvement measures in response to the above problems, we guarantee that we can use 5,000 catties less alcohol in the second half of this year, which is equivalent to saving more than 25,000 catties of grain for the country.

    Promote the Use of White Clay for Making Paste
    After the "Reader's Letters" page published the letter "White Clay Can Be Used to Make Paste" on June 26, some units have already started using this method with good results.
    The Shenyang Brewing Factory tried using first-grade white mud (white clay) produced by the Shenyang Mining Factory to replace flour in making paste. Because white clay contains a large amount of silicon dioxide and aluminum trioxide, the paste made has a strong adhesive force and is not easily spoiled. After this factory used white clay paste to affix labels, it can save about 1,500 catties of flour each year. In addition, the cheapest flour costs 12 cents per catty, while white clay is only worth half a cent per catty, thus the cost is also reduced.
    The Fengzhen County Grain Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region first mobilized the Yizhonghe Shoe Store to conduct typical experiments based on the method introduced in this newspaper, and the results were very good; then, through the industrial and commercial administrative departments, it convened the town's paste-using businesses to promote the method, and conducted on-site experiments again. All paste-using businesses agreed to use it, which can save two-thirds of the flour used for making paste.

    积极节约工业用粮
    用泥浆代替米浆作绸缎印花浆料编辑同志：
    目前，绸缎印花地子浆料一般都用糯米和清糠，这项工业用粮的数量很大。政府提出节约粮食的号召以后，上海市私营光华印花厂在中国丝绸公司上海分公司的支持和帮助下，试验用泥土代替印花地子浆中的糯米和糠粉。经过三十多次的反复试验，这个办法已经成功了。五月份，他们用百分之五十到百分之六十的泥浆代替糯米浆所生产的乔其纱，质量完全合乎标准。
    印花地子浆用泥浆代替糯米浆的创造成功后，已经在上海各印花加工厂逐步推广。在六月份的加工任务中，除了光华印花厂继续进行花色试样外，大康印花厂也就两种绸缎进行试验，打出了样子，并且生产了一百八十多匹；其余各印花厂也都在陆续积极进行打样工作。从七月份起，上海各印花厂大量采用泥土混合浆料生产，所产绸缎八千六百八十四匹，占上海丝绸分公司委托各厂加工印花绸匹的百分之八十二点二。八月份上海市外销花样绸缎，已经全部采用混合浆料生产。
    这项工业用粮采用了代用品，可以节约大量的粮食。据初步统计，今年上海外销绸缎采用混合泥浆就为国家节约糯米四十万斤，糠粉近万斤。因为泥土来源充足，价格便宜，还可以大大地降低印花成本。这项节约粮食的好办法，值得在各地印花厂普遍推广。

    降低酒精消耗，节约粮食编辑同志：
    我们衡阳市公私合营华新制药厂是专门提炼国产药材的，产品除片剂、粉剂和水溶性的以外，都要用酒精作原料。我们每月消耗的酒精约在一万斤以上，需要用五万斤谷子才能酿成。六月份，职工们在中共衡阳市委的号召下，努力降低了酒精的消耗，为国家节约了一批粮食。
    我们在保证不降低产品质量的条件下，尽可能降低产品酒精的含量。例如，提炼白芍，原来要用五倍酒精渗，经过工人们精心操作，用四倍酒精渗就可以了；提炼紫草，原来要用六十度的酒精，现在改为四十度的酒精就行了。过去渗一种产品时，除了产品应该用的酒精倍数外，还要加进一至三倍的拌料酒精。现在经过工人们的研究，拌料用的酒精完全可以节省。过去，渗菊花应该用六倍酒精，拌料又要再加三倍酒精，如果每天渗五百斤菊花，就要浪费酒精一百六十六斤多。
    从前，由于没有严格地遵守操作规程，在“稀释”方面浪费的酒精也很多。按规定，流浸膏是不“稀释”的，而且每斤生药应该做成五百公分成药，它的初液应含百分之八十五，续液应含百分之十五。但是由于操作不严，续液没有流够足量，经常差百分之十到十五，以致不得不再加入百分之十到十五的酒精来“稀释”，造成严重的浪费。不久以前做的一批麻黄流浸膏，就因此浪费了酒精三万六千九百公分。
    现在我们工厂的职工，针对上面这些问题，提出改进办法以后，保证今年下半年可以少用酒精五千多斤，等于为国家节约二万五千多斤谷子。

    推广用白黏土做浆糊的办法
    六月二十六日“读者来信专页”发表了“白黏土可以制作浆糊”的来信后，有些单位已经开始采用这项办法，效果很好。
    沈阳市酿造厂试用沈阳市矿业厂所产的一级白泥（白黏土）代替面粉作浆糊。由于白黏土含有大量的二氧化矽和三氧化二铝，因此制成的浆糊黏着力很强，并且不易腐败。这个厂使用白泥制的浆糊贴商标后，每年可以节约面粉一千五百斤左右。另外，最便宜的面粉每斤需一角二分，而白泥每斤只值半分，因此成本也降低了。
    内蒙古自治区丰镇县粮食局先动员义中和鞋铺根据本报介绍的办法作了典型试验，结果很好；接着就通过工商行政部门召集全镇用浆糊行业户宣传推广，并再次作了实地试验。各用浆糊户都同意使用，这样就可以节省三分之二做浆糊的面粉。
