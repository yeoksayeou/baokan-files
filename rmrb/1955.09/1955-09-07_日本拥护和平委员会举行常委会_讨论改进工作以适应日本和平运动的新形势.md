    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 5th: The Japan Peace Committee held a Standing Committee meeting in Tokyo on August 18th to discuss improving its work to adapt to the new developments in the Japanese peace movement.
    The meeting affirmed that the surge in the Japanese people's demand for peace since the spring of 1954, when the Japanese people opposed the American hydrogen bomb explosion on Bikini Atoll, and the unprecedented unity formed in anticipation of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, indicated that the Japanese peace movement had entered a new stage of development.
    Ogata Shoji, head of the secretariat of the Japan Peace Committee, pointed out at the meeting that the Japan Peace Committee's activities over the five years since its establishment had made a significant contribution to promoting the Japanese peace movement to its current scale. This influence has become a huge force that cannot be ignored. Ogata Shoji pointed out that, due to the rapid development of the situation, the Japan Peace Committee is still unable to fully adapt to the current high tide of the Japanese peace movement. Therefore, he suggested a comprehensive review of the Japan Peace Committee's policies, activities, and organizational structure.
    The meeting heatedly discussed Ogata Shoji's proposal and decided to summarize and review the work of the past five years and reform the organizational structure. The meeting decided to invite peace advocates from all walks of life to hold informal discussions to solicit their opinions on the future direction of the peace movement and how to improve the work of the Japan Peace Committee.
    The Japan Peace Committee called on its branches and peace organizations in various regions to discuss this issue and put forward practical and feasible suggestions.

    日本拥护和平委员会举行常委会
    讨论改进工作以适应日本和平运动的新形势
    新华社五日讯　东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会曾在八月十八日在东京举行常任委员会会议，讨论了改进工作以适应日本和平运动发展的新形势的问题。
    会议在讨论中确认：一九五四年春天日本人民反对美国在比基尼岛的氢弹爆炸以来日本全国人民高涨起来的对和平的要求和迎接禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会而形成的空前的大团结表示了日本的和平运动已经进入一个新的发展阶段。
    日本拥护和平委员会书记处负责人尾形昭二在会上指出：日本拥护和平委员会成立后五年来的活动对于促使日本和平运动高涨到今天这样的规模是有重大贡献的。这种影响已经变成了不可忽视的巨大力量。尾形昭二指出：但是，由于形势的迅速发展，日本拥护和平委员会还不能完全适应现阶段日本和平运动的高涨的情势。因此，他建议全面地检查日本拥护和平委员会的方针、活动和组织机构等。
    会议热烈地讨论了尾形昭二的建议，并且决定要总结检查五年来的工作，改革组织机构。会议决定邀请各界和平人士举行恳谈会，听取他们对今后和平运动的方向和改进日本拥护和平委员会的工作方面的意见。
    日本拥护和平委员会号召它在各地的分会和各地和平组织讨论这个问题，并且提出切实可行的意见。
