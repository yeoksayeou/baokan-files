On the Road to Socialism

    Guangdong Province has begun the work of transforming the Jianjiang Plain, an effort aimed at fundamentally eliminating the historical waterlogging and drought disasters in this area.

    Guangdong Province has established the Jianjiang Plain Construction Committee. The Provincial People's Committee has allocated an initial investment of one million yuan to this committee. Currently, there are ten water conservancy projects under construction or about to begin construction.

    The Jianjiang River is located in western Guangdong Province, flowing through Maoming, Hua County, Wuchuan, Dianbai, and other counties, with a population of over one million in its basin. Before liberation, the Jianjiang River was more of a source of harm than benefit. Since liberation, over 14,000 small-scale water conservancy projects have been built, and over 100 kilometers of dikes have been repaired, playing a certain role in preventing waterlogging and drought. However, due to the lack of forests and severe soil erosion, nearly one million mu of farmland still suffer from drought or flooding almost every year.

    The work now underway to transform the Jianjiang Plain includes developing forestry and water conservancy construction. It is estimated that within three years, bare areas will be greened, with nearly 900,000 mu of water source forests and soil conservation forests planted, so that after six years they can begin to play a role in conserving water and soil and preventing waterlogging and drought disasters. At the same time, more than 50 key water conservancy projects, such as drainage and irrigation projects and pumping stations, will be built, and more than 30,000 wells and 6,000 ponds will be dug, forming an interlaced irrigation network, so that the benefited farmland will reach more than 1.7 million mu.

### 广东根治鉴江平原水旱灾害

    广东根治鉴江平原水旱灾害
    广东省鉴江平原的改造工作已经开始，这个工作是要从根本上消除这个平原上的历史性的水旱灾害。
    广东省已成立了鉴江平原建设委员会。省人民委员会已拨出第一批投资一百万元给这个建设委员会。目前已施工和即将施工的水利工程共有十项。
    鉴江在广东省的西部，流经茂名、化县、吴川、电白等县，流域人口有一百多万。解放前，鉴江是一条害多益少的河道。解放后由于兴修了一万四千多处小型水利，培修了一百多公里的堤围，对防御水旱起了一定的作用。但由于森林缺乏，水土流失严重，几乎每年仍不免有近百万亩农田受旱或受淹。
    现在开始的改造鉴江平原的工作，包括发展林业和水利建设。预计在三年内，要做到绿化裸露地带，共营造水源林和水土保持林近九十万亩，以便六年后可开始发挥保持水土、防止水旱灾害的作用；同时要兴建排涝、灌溉工程和抽水机站等重点水利工程五十多项，挖掘水井三万多口和水塘六千多口，形成交错的灌溉网，使受益农田达到一百七十多万亩。（新华社）
