    The Splendid Art of the Ajanta Caves
    Liu Kaiqu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association

    From June 22nd to 29th of this year, a hall at the Helsinki World Peace Conference venue displayed exhibits brought by delegations from various countries, resembling a small-scale international cultural exchange exhibition. These exhibits aroused great interest among the peace delegates from various countries. The color pictures of parts of the Ajanta murals brought by the Indian delegation particularly caught the attention of the delegates. The composition of the Indian Ajanta murals from more than 1,500 years ago was so beautiful, the lines were so smooth, the colors were so rich, and the images were so vivid and lively! Many visitors lingered in front of these pictures. After seeing the long scroll depicting the tragic scene of Hiroshima, Japan, after the atomic bomb, and then looking at the Ajanta murals, I felt even more that in order to ensure that mankind can avoid disasters like Hiroshima, and to protect human civilization and these great artistic heritages, we must resolutely oppose any aggressive war by imperialism and defend lasting world peace!

    The World Peace Council's call to commemorate the 1,500th anniversary of the Ajanta murals this year is very meaningful, especially for the Chinese people, it is even more welcome. The people of China and India have had frequent exchanges and cultural exchanges since ancient times, maintaining a long-standing good relationship of peaceful coexistence, becoming a unique example in international history. Chinese painting, sculpture, music, and dance from the Northern and Southern Dynasties onwards were influenced by Indian art, and India also absorbed a lot from Chinese art. Today, the "Exhibition Commemorating the 1,500th Anniversary of the Ajanta Murals of India" is grandly exhibited in the capital of our new China, which is a major event for China and India to conduct artistic exchanges, strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the two peoples under the common will of defending peace.

    The Ajanta Caves art of India is composed of sculptures and murals, and the murals are particularly famous. The Ajanta Caves are located in the Vindhya Mountains of Hyderabad Province, India, and are carved on cliffs. There are a total of twenty-nine caves. The dates of excavation of these caves cannot be clearly determined so far. Some say they started in the second century BC, others say in the first century BC, and the ending period is about the sixth or seventh century AD, that is, when Buddhism began to decline. The themes of the murals are mainly Buddhist stories, and there are many decorations. These murals are generally divided into three periods: early, middle, and late, by researchers, but in terms of their style and artistic integrity, they can also be divided into two categories: one is the works before the Gupta Dynasty, and the other is the works from the beginning of the Gupta Dynasty until the end of the Ajanta Caves. The first type of work is relatively simple and pure, but the images are already lively and very moving, such as the story of the six-tusk white elephant in Cave 10, and "The Procession of the King, Queen, and Entourage." The second type is the more brilliant Indian classical art. India began its golden age of art from the Gupta Dynasty in the fourth century. During the Gupta Dynasty, on the social basis of the reunification of India, on the one hand, it absorbed the advantages of Gandhara art, which was influenced by Greek sculptures from Asia Minor, and on the other hand, it tried its best to revive the spirit of the original ancient Indian art, integrating them and creating the great art with a unique style of this era, presenting unprecedented glory in the history of ancient Indian culture. We see the court scenes in Cave 17, "Indra and the Heavenly Maidens," and "Bodhisattva with Lotus" in Cave 1, "Birth of Buddha" in Cave 2, "Believers Offering Offerings," and many murals such as the caisson patterns composed of images of apsaras, animals, flowers, and plants, all have skilled lines, rich colors, complex and harmonious composition, clear character movements, and vivid expressions. As for the sculptures, especially the many sculptures in Cave 19 and Cave 26, whether they are Buddha statues or ordinary figures, they are lively in posture, round and symmetrical in skin, and very beautiful. Although the themes of these murals and sculptures are all stories related to Buddhism, from the narration of the stories, the descriptions of the life, environment, and costumes of the characters, etc., there are many expressions of the face of ancient Indian society and the thoughts and feelings of various different characters, full of the atmosphere of life, giving the viewer a sense of reality and beauty. From the style and technology of these murals and sculptures, we can also see the mutual influence between the cave arts of Dunhuang, Maijishan, Yungang, Longmen, and Tianlongshan in our country and Indian art. The Ajanta Caves art is a rare and precious work in ancient world art, a creation of the high labor and wisdom of the great Indian people, and a great contribution of the Indian people to the world cultural history.

    The exhibition commemorating the 1,500th anniversary of the Ajanta Murals of India will enable the Chinese people to further understand India, and will enable our Chinese art workers to more fully appreciate the ancient art of India, and at the same time, it will further promote the mutual respect, understanding, and close cooperation between the Chinese and Indian peoples in the great cause of defending world peace. We warmly welcome this precious exhibition of great significance!

    辉煌的阿旃陀石窟艺术
    中国美术家协会副主席　刘开渠
    本年六月二十二日到二十九日，在赫尔辛基世界和平大会会场的一个大厅里，陈列了好些国家的代表团所带去的展览品，好像是个小型的国际文化交流展览会。这些展览品，引起了各国和平代表极大的兴趣。印度代表团所带去的阿旃陀壁画的一部分彩色图片，特别使代表们注意。一千五百多年前的印度阿旃陀壁画，构图是这样的美，线条是这样的流畅，色彩是这样的丰富，形象是这样的生动活泼！很多参观者在这些图片前留恋不去。我看了描绘日本广岛被原子弹轰炸的惨景长幅画片后，又看阿旃陀壁画，更感觉到为了保证人类能避免像广岛那样的灾难，为了维护人类的文明和这些伟大的艺术遗产，我们必须坚决反对帝国主义的任何侵略战争，保卫世界持久和平！
    世界和平理事会号召在今年举行印度阿旃陀壁画一千五百年纪念，是非常有意义的，尤其是对中国人民来说，更是值得欢迎。中国和印度两国人民自古以来就频繁往来，交流文化，保持着悠久的和平相处的良好关系，成为国际史上仅有的范例。中国从南北朝以后的绘画、雕塑、音乐、舞蹈，曾受印度艺术的影响，印度也从中国艺术吸取了很多东西。今天，“印度阿旃陀壁画一千五百年纪念展览”，在我们新中国的首都隆重展出，更是中印两国人民在保卫和平的共同意志下进行艺术交流、加强和巩固两国人民友谊的一件大事。
    印度阿旃陀石窟艺术由雕刻和壁画所组成，而壁画尤其著名。阿旃陀石窟在印度海德拉巴省的文达雅山脉中，开凿在悬崖立壁上，共有二十九窟。这些石窟开凿的年代，至今还不能明确肯定，有的说开始于纪元前二世纪，也有的说是纪元前一世纪的，终止时期大约是纪元六、七世纪，即佛教开始衰颓的时候。壁画的题材主要是佛教的故事，另有许多装饰。这些壁画，一般研究者都把它分为早、中、晚三个时期，但就其风格和艺术完整性说，也可分为两大类：一类属于笈多王朝以前的作品，另一类属于笈多王朝开始以后直到阿旃陀石窟终止开凿为止的作品。第一类作品比较朴素、单纯，但已是形象活泼，十分动人，如第十窟的六牙白象故事、“国王、王妃和随从的行列”等。第二类则是更为灿烂的印度古典艺术。印度自四世纪笈多王朝起，开始了艺术的黄金时代。笈多王朝时期，在印度重新统一的社会基础上，一方面吸收由从小亚细亚希腊雕刻影响而产生的犍陀罗艺术的优点，一方面又极力复兴古印度原有艺术的精神，融会贯通，创造了这一时代独具风格的伟大艺术，在古代印度文化史上呈现着空前未有的光彩。我们看十七窟的宫廷景色、“因陀罗和天女图”等，和第一窟的“莲花手菩萨”、第二窟的“佛陀诞生图”、“信徒奉献供品”以及由飞天、动物、花草的形象所组成的藻井图案等许多壁画，都是线条纯熟，色彩富丽，构图复杂而和谐紧凑，人物动作明确，表情生动。至于雕刻，特别是第十九窟和二十六窟的许多雕刻品，无论佛像或一般人物，都是体态活泼，肌肤圆润、匀称，很是美丽。这些壁画和雕刻作品的题材，虽然都不外乎是些同佛教有关的故事，但从故事的叙述，对人物生活、环境和服饰等等的描写中，有很多表现了古代印度社会的面貌，和各种不同人物的思想感情，充满了生活的气息，给观者以真实感和美感。我们从这些壁画和雕刻的风格、技术上，也能看出我国敦煌、麦积山、云岗、龙门、天龙山等石窟艺术同印度艺术的互相影响关系。阿旃陀石窟艺术，是世界古代美术中稀有的珍贵作品，是伟大的印度人民高度劳动和智慧的创作，是印度人民在世界文化史上伟大的贡献。
    印度阿旃陀壁画一千五百年纪念展览，将使中国人民更进一步地认识印度，将使我们中国的美术工作者更能满足地欣赏印度的古代艺术，同时更将促进中印两国人民互相尊重、了解和在保卫世界和平的伟大事业上的密切合作。我们热烈地欢迎这个具有重大意义的珍贵的展览！
