    Xinjiang Province Expands Winter Wheat Planting Area
    The agricultural areas of Xinjiang Province will begin sowing winter wheat from the beginning of September. This year's winter wheat planting area has been greatly expanded. Southern Xinjiang, which has seen continuous bumper harvests of winter wheat, plans to sow more than 3,475,000 mu of winter wheat, an increase of more than 200,000 mu over last year. The Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, which have not promoted winter wheat cultivation in the past, have also prepared to plant approximately 420,000 mu this year after several years of trial planting.
    The wheat field area in Xinjiang Province accounts for more than 50 percent of the total planting area of food crops, and the winter wheat planting area accounts for more than 46 percent of the wheat field area. The situation of winter wheat planting in various parts of Tianshan North and South in recent years shows that: most areas are suitable for planting winter wheat; as long as the sowing is timely and the management is appropriate, the average yield can be 20 percent higher than that of spring wheat.

    新疆省扩大冬小麦播种面积
    新疆农业地区从九月初旬开始播种冬麦。今年冬麦播种面积大大扩大，连年种植冬麦获得丰产的南疆地区，准备播种冬麦三百四十七万五千多亩，比去年增加了二十多万亩。过去未推广种植过冬麦的伊犁哈萨克自治州和博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州，经过几年的试种，今年也准备种植四十二万亩左右。
    新疆省麦田面积占粮食作物总播种面积的百分之五十以上，而冬麦播种面积又占到麦田面积的百分之四十六强。几年来天山南北各地种植冬麦的情况表明：绝大部分地区都宜于种植冬麦；只要播种适时，经营得当，一般产量可比春麦高出百分之二十。　（本报集体通讯员新疆日报编辑部）
