	In Switzerland, a country of beautiful lakes and mountains, September is the season of crisp autumn air and the beginning of the theatrical season in theaters across the country. It is at this time that the Chinese Art Troupe, eagerly awaited by the Swiss people, has arrived.

	Since September 1st, the art troupe has performed in the cities of Basel, Zurich, and Geneva. As in other European countries, tickets for the Chinese Art Troupe's performances in these locations were sold out several days before the show.

	During the performances in Geneva on September 7th and 8th, the audience included not only Geneva citizens and overseas Chinese, but also viewers from neighboring Italy and West Germany, as well as those from distant North and South America. Among the audience were the Mayor and Governor of Geneva, many foreign diplomats and consulate staff stationed in Geneva, and the renowned Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg, who was in Geneva for a writers' conference. Wang Bingnan, the Chinese representative to the Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks, and the American representative, Johnson, also came to see the Chinese Art Troupe's performance.

	The rich and varied performances of the Chinese Art Troupe complemented the bright lakes and mountains of Geneva. At the "Grand Theatre" on the shores of Lake Geneva, more than a thousand seats were completely filled. To satisfy people's eagerness, some seats were temporarily added, and some standing tickets were sold. After the curtain rose, the compact plot of the first program, "At the Crossroads," immediately captured the hearts of the audience, holding them in suspense at tense moments and making them laugh out loud during humorous parts. The other drama, dance, and music programs also achieved the same success. The different plots and performances of each program gave people different impressions and moods. But one thing was the same: all the audience members were moved by the healthy, joyful, and optimistic spirit of the Chinese people as expressed by the Chinese artists. After each performance, the audience applauded enthusiastically and requested an encore. During the performance on September 7th, the actors took bows up to fifty times.

	The Chinese Art Troupe's performances in the above-mentioned three cities in the past ten days have won unanimous praise from newspapers throughout Switzerland. "Basler Nachrichten" wrote on the 2nd: "The Beijing Opera, which once overwhelmed the Parisian art scene, also performed extraordinarily beautiful scenes in front of the intoxicated and fascinated Basel audience last night... The beautiful scene of 'Lotus Dance' immediately swept away the audience's fear of not understanding foreign plays from the very beginning... 'At the Crossroads' is a true artistic masterpiece." The newspaper also said: "The performance of the Beijing Troupe is a combination of strong youth, vitality, and full artistic training."

	The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" praised the Chinese Art Troupe's performance on the 7th as "an extraordinary success for the Chinese guests." It said: "For European actors, singers, and dancers, excerpts from Chinese classical drama are a real textbook."

	The Geneva "Swiss Newspaper" emphasized in its theater review on the 8th the "specific style and strong expression" of Chinese performing arts. The newspaper said: "Everything makes the deepest impression, especially the almost thrilling precision in the dance, while not affecting the beauty and balance of the posture."

	The "Journal de Genève" wrote on the 8th: "Chinese classical drama is a special kind of drama that retains the characteristics of traditional realism while being rich and varied. This is reflected in the direction, in the graceful movements of the actors, in the scenery, and in the costumes." The Geneva "Voice of the Workers" believes that the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe is a major event in Geneva's artistic life.

	"La Tribune de Genève" introduced the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe in a special column on the 5th and published photos of "Red Silk Dance" and "At the Crossroads." The caption of the "Red Silk Dance" photo in this newspaper said that the dance "reflects the joy and confidence of the victorious people." The newspaper said in another article: "We salute these prestigious artists who have brought us the rich and varied things of a very clever, very young, and very old nation."

    中国艺术团在瑞士
    新华社记者　陈适五
    在瑞士这个湖光山色风景优美的国度里，九月正是秋高气爽的季节，也正是各剧院一年中戏剧季节开始的时候。在这个时候，瑞士人民翘首盼望的中国艺术团到来了。
    从九月一日开始，艺术团已经先后在巴塞尔、苏黎世和日内瓦三个城市作了演出。也像在欧洲其他国家里一样，中国艺术团在这些地方演出的戏票，早在上演前好几天就被预购一空了。
    九月七、八两日在日内瓦的演出中，前往观看的不仅有日内瓦的市民和日内瓦的华侨，还有邻近的意大利和西德，以及遥远的南北美洲的观众。观众中间还有日内瓦的市长和州长，许多外国驻日内瓦的外交官和领事馆人员和在日内瓦参加作家会见的苏联著名作家爱伦堡。参加中美两国大使级会谈的中国代表王炳南和美国代表约翰逊也来观看了中国艺术团的表演。
    中国艺术团丰富多采的表演同日内瓦明媚的湖光山色交相辉映。在莱蒙湖畔的“大戏院”里，一千多个座位完全坐满了。为了满足人们的渴望，不得不临时添加了一些坐位和出售了一些站票。启幕后，第一个节目“三岔口”的紧凑剧情马上就攫住了观众们的心，紧张处扣人心弦，幽默处使人不禁失笑。上演的其他戏剧、舞蹈和音乐节目也都取得了同样的成就。各个节目的不同的剧情和不同的表演给人们以不同的印象和意境。但是有一点是相同的，那就是所有观众都被中国艺术家表现出来的中国人民的健康、愉快和乐观主义的情调感动了。每演完一出，观众都热烈鼓掌，要求重演。九月七日演出的那一场演员们就谢幕达五十次。
    中国艺术团近十天来在上述三个城市的演出，赢得了瑞士各地报纸一致的好评。“巴塞尔新闻”二日写道：“曾经压倒巴黎艺坛的北京歌剧昨晚也在被陶醉和被吸引的巴塞尔观众面前表演了异常美观的场面……‘荷花舞’的优美场面从一开始就把观众害怕看不懂外国戏的想法一扫而空……‘三岔口’是一个真正的艺术杰作。”这家报纸又说：“北京剧团的演出是强有力的青春、活力和充分的艺术训练的综合。”
    “新苏黎世报”七日称赞中国艺术团的演出是“中国客人异常的成功”。它说：“对于欧洲的演员、歌唱家和舞蹈家来说，中国古典戏剧中片段的演出乃是一本真正的教科书。”
    日内瓦“瑞士报”八日在剧评中特别强调指出中国表演艺术的“特定的风格和强烈的表情”。这家报纸说：“一切都使人产生最深刻的印象，特别是舞蹈中有近乎惊险的精确性，同时又并不影响姿态的优美和平衡。”
    “日内瓦邮报”八日写道：“中国古典剧是一种特殊的戏剧，它保持了传统的现实主义的特征，同时又是丰富多采的。这表现在导演上，在演员的优美的动作上，在布景上和服装上。”日内瓦“工人之声报”认为中国艺术团的演出是日内瓦艺术生活中的一件大事。
    “日内瓦新闻”在五日以专栏地位介绍中国艺术团的演出，并且刊载了“红绸舞”和“三岔口”的照片。这家报纸在“红绸舞”剧照的说明文字中说，这个舞蹈“反映了胜利了的人民的愉快和信心”。这家报纸在另一篇文章中说：“我们向这些享有盛誉的艺术家们致敬，他们把一个非常聪明的、非常年青而又非常古老的民族的丰富多采的东西带给了我们。”
