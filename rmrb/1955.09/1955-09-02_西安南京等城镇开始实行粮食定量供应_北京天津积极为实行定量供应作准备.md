Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st. Starting September 1st, Xi'an City, Baoji, Weinan, Yan'an, Tongchuan, Hanzhong, and eleven other medium and small cities in Shaanxi Province began implementing a rationed grain supply system for urban areas. These cities have distributed all urban resident grain supply certificates to residents. Grain coupons needed by transient populations have also been issued to grassroots grain organizations, ready for urban residents to exchange and use.

These cities made thorough preparations before implementing the rationed grain supply. The Shaanxi Provincial Grain Department studied the grain consumption of towns and cities and the people's grain-use habits, and formulated grain ration supply standards for residents of various towns and cities throughout the province, making the monthly grain ration standard for residents more in line with actual needs. Baoji, Weinan, Suide, Ankang, Shangxian and other cities successively selected key streets to conduct trial implementation of rationed grain supply in mid-August. In Xi'an, nearly three thousand cadres verified the population among the residents, assessed grain consumption, and also adjusted the city's grain supply network. All cities also made specific arrangements for public and private food industries, non-staple food industries, grain processing industries, and brewing industries, and their grain needs were properly supplied.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 1st. Today, Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Nantong, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, Changshu, and Xin'hailian nine cities in Jiangsu Province began implementing a grain ration supply system. The planned grain sales volume for September, formulated by each city based on residents' grain purchase plans, has decreased compared to August. In Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Xuzhou, and Nantong, more than 30,000 reporters, propagandists, and street cadres carefully explained the interim measures for rationed grain supply in towns and cities and the significance of implementing these measures to residents in advance.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Beijing is actively preparing to implement a grain supply system based on per capita rationing. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee are studying the implementation plan for rationed supply. In recent days, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee and the People's Committees of various districts have organized many working groups to select some street residents' committees and factories to conduct pilot work on rationed grain supply, investigate the consumption levels of various residents, and study methods of classification and grading. Industrial units such as coal mines, railways, construction, transportation, municipal administration, handicraft production cooperatives, and major local state-owned factories throughout the city are also conducting job classification and queuing work. The city's workers will have their grain consumption reasonably determined based on various different labor conditions.

The People's Committees of various districts have established or strengthened working organizations specifically to implement the method of supplying grain based on per capita rationing. The city is preparing to transfer and train a large number of cadres to participate in this work. The grain management department is also actively preparing to train the business personnel of grain supply stations and supply points in various districts, so that they are familiar with various procedures and systems.

The grain management departments of various districts are preparing to comprehensively adjust the grain supply network, and use the private grain stores that distribute and sell goods on behalf of the state to arrange the location of more than 1,000 supply points throughout the city to facilitate residents' grain purchases.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: At an enlarged meeting held on August 30th, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee decided that Tianjin would implement a grain ration supply system starting October 1st. The meeting also discussed and approved the "Tianjin Grain Ration Supply Implementation Rules" and the "Tianjin Rural Grain Unified Purchase and Sale Implementation Plan."

Currently, grain workers and reporters in various districts of Tianjin are studying documents related to rationed grain supply, preparing to thoroughly explain national grain laws to residents. The leading organs of Tianjin will soon conduct key pilot work on rationed grain supply among workers and citizens in the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and several streets.

    各区人民委员会为了贯彻按人定量供应粮食的办法，都专门成立或加强了工作机构。全市准备抽调训练大批干部参加这次工作。粮食管理部门也正在积极准备训练各区粮食供应站和供应点的业务人员，以便使他们熟悉各种手续和制度。
    各区粮食管理部门正在准备全面开始调整粮食供应网，并利用为国家经销和代销的私营粮店，安排全市一千多个供应点的位置，以便利居民购粮。
    据新华社讯　天津市人民委员会在八月三十日举行的扩大会议上，决定天津市从十月一日开始实行粮食定量供应制度，会议并讨论和通过了“天津市粮食定量供应实施细则”和“天津市农村粮食统购统销实施方案”。
    现在，天津市各区粮食工作人员和报告员正在学习有关粮食定量供应的文件，准备向居民深入地解释国家粮食法令。天津市领导机关即将在天津市第一机器厂和若干街道的工人和市民中，分别进行粮食定量供应的重点试办工作。
