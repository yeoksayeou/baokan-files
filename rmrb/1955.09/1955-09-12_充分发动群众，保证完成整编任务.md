Fully Mobilize the Masses to Ensure the Completion of the Streamlining Task
中共石景山钢铁厂委员会 (CPC Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Committee)

    In March of this year, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC instructed us to vigorously rectify labor organization and eliminate the phenomenon of overstaffing. According to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, we repeatedly assessed the situation and calculated the figures, and in July, we officially began the work of streamlining staffing and simplifying the organizational structure. At the end of July, the streamlining work came to an end. This streamlining, due to our conscientious implementation of the instructions of the higher-level Party committee and the mobilization of the masses for discussion, resulted in a reduction of 28.86 percent of the total number of employees, exceeding the original target of 15.5 percent issued by the higher-level leading organs. As a result, the expected full-member labor productivity for 1955 can be increased by 27.7 percent compared to 1954. In terms of wages and supplementary wages alone, from July 20 to the end of the year, the state can save 1.23 million yuan. This streamlining focused on reducing non-production workers, auxiliary workers, and general staff, abolishing unnecessary functional organizations such as the director's office, abolishing the level of functional group leaders who did not do specific work in the past, and some unnecessary functional personnel in the workshops. In the main production departments, four shifts were organized to increase the time workers spend studying while on the job, and one shift can be drawn at any time when the state needs it. As of the end of August, some of the workers drawn out have been transferred to brother factories and mines. The main workshops have begun to be organized into four shifts. In some workshops where the number of people has been reduced, the work arrangements are more reasonable, the morale of the masses is good, and labor productivity has increased significantly. The production plans for July and August were both overfulfilled.

    In the past, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had a large organizational structure and a serious phenomenon of overstaffing. In 1954, the total output value increased by only 19.64 percent compared to 1952, while the average number of employees on the register for the whole year increased by 25.5 percent compared to 1952; the proportion of non-production personnel increased significantly, and in 1954, non-production personnel accounted for 14.8 percent of production workers. Therefore, although the labor productivity of production workers has increased, the full-member labor productivity in 1954 decreased by 4.67 percent compared to 1952.

    The large and bloated organizational structure and the overstaffing were manifested in many aspects. For example, there were too many levels and duplication of work. There were already 22 functional organizations at the factory level, and the workshops also set up a wide variety of functional groups and functional personnel. There were 147 functional group leaders in the entire factory, of which most of the 84 functional group leaders in the departments did not do specific work, but only "arranged, checked, and urged" every day. According to incomplete statistics, 91 production team leaders in the whole factory were separated from production (according to the original regulations, team leaders should not be separated from production). These people were all senior skilled workers, and they did not have much to do in reality when they were separated from production. The workers and they themselves had many opinions about this. Another example is that the division of labor was too detailed and the mobile force was too large. The Technology and Safety Section had eight regional inspectors and four professional inspectors. The regional inspectors were only responsible for reflecting the situation, and the professional inspectors went down to solve the problems. The Technical Education Section had a total of 14 people, but only processed an average of two or three documents per day, but it had three people for clerical work, documentation, and statistics. When processing documents, the document clerk would read it and transfer it to the section chief, who would approve it and hand it over to the document clerk, who would then transfer it to the administrative staff (the administrative staff was responsible for receiving, dispatching, and keeping documents). The statistician had nothing to do at all. In many units, what one person could do was often assigned to two, or even three or four people. For example, the workshops also had mobile teams without any fixed work. The Iron Smelting Department alone had 234 people. People said this was a "manpower warehouse."

    Because the organizational structure was large and bloated, the phenomena of many official documents, many reports, and many meetings followed. According to statistics, the factory issued 182 notices, 339 signed reports, and 579 documents from January to May this year, many of which were unnecessary. There were more than 1,000 kinds of original records in the whole factory, many of which could be cancelled or simplified. Each department had a department affairs meeting at the upper level and a group affairs meeting at the lower level. Sometimes, joint meetings of group leaders were held. Many daily tasks were brought up at meetings, wasting time and affecting cadres' ability to go deep into the grassroots.

    Why did this happen? The main reason is that we did not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of improving labor productivity, and we lacked a comprehensive concept of completing the plan. We felt that the proportion of wages in the cost was very small, and that adding a few workers did not matter. We even thought that "more people can get things done better." Therefore, when we talked about increasing production, we wanted to increase people, without paying attention to rationally organizing labor and improving work methods. For example, in 1952, in order to prepare for the expansion and development of the factory, we blindly increased the number of personnel in large numbers, so that by the end of the year, we had increased by 1,785 people compared to the beginning of the year. In fact, there was no need to increase personnel at that time. In addition, our study and mastery of the state's labor policy was insufficient. At the same time, we lacked analysis and research on our work. The factory had long calculated labor productivity only in terms of production workers, not all employees, so it did not discover the decline in full-member labor productivity for a long time, resulting in the bad consequence of a large waste of labor.

    The reason why this streamlining work could be carried out relatively smoothly is mainly because the leadership grasped the following aspects of work.

    The leadership made the greatest determination for the streamlining work and conducted detailed investigation and research work. At the beginning of the streamlining work, middle-level leaders and staff had insufficient understanding of the serious phenomenon of manpower waste, and their understanding of the spirit of improving work and improving work efficiency through streamlining was not enough. They generally complained of difficulties. Therefore, the first time the figures were calculated, the streamlining figures proposed by the whole factory were very conservative, accounting for only 10.6 percent of the total number of employees. The second time, it was increased to 22.8 percent, but the third and fourth times, it fell back to 18.6 percent. Under such circumstances, the Party committee took various measures to resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee and the Municipal Committee on streamlining work. We organized cadres to study Lenin's articles on improving labor productivity, so that everyone understood the great significance of improving labor productivity, and criticized the erroneous idea of cadres at all levels that increasing personnel was the only way to increase production.

    At the same time, the Party committee referred to the advanced staffing standards of brother factories, studied the situation of the factory, and affirmed that the streamlining figures proposed at that time were conservative. After repeated investigation and research, the leadership put forward new streamlining targets, and instructed leaders and staff at all levels to resolutely implement them. When proposing the new streamlining targets, the leadership had studied the staffing standards of staff and engineering and technical personnel in Soviet ferrous metallurgical enterprises, the advanced staffing standards of brother factories and mines, and the labor measurement data of the factory; at the same time, the workload of all employees in the factory was compared with each other, and the advanced ones were found to persuade and educate the backward ones.

    In the streamlining work, the leadership was often lagging behind the masses. At the beginning of the streamlining, some leaders emphasized that "the level of cadres is low, and more people can get things done better"; some people wanted to reduce the number of personnel by "pushing tasks"; some people only "asked for basis and bargained" with higher authorities. Under such circumstances, the streamlining work could only be carried out smoothly by letting go and mobilizing the masses. However, at the beginning of the streamlining work, many workers also had ideological concerns. For example, some employees were afraid that "if there are fewer people, the work of those who are left will be heavier"; some people were unwilling to be transferred to work in remote places, some people were afraid of becoming "redundant cadres," and thought that redundant personnel were not honorable, and some people were afraid of streamlining because they had suffered the pain of unemployment in the old society. In response to these ideas, the Party organization first explained four truths to the workers: First, it explained that in order to realize the country's first five-year plan, the country would build many new factories and mines, and the employees of existing factories and mines must obey the needs of the state and be prepared to support the construction of new factories and mines at any time. Second, it gave the employees a breakdown, so that everyone understood the benefits of improving labor productivity for the country, and explained that accurately calculating labor time and improving labor productivity was the most important saving. Third, it explained that building socialism depends on our hard work, and pointed out that the factory's excessive number of personnel had resulted in a gradual increase in average wages, while labor productivity had decreased, which caused great losses to the country. Fourth, it pointed out the low level of culture and technology of all employees in the factory, and explained that by organizing workers to study after streamlining, everyone's culture and technology level could be improved. At the same time, because we explained the policies to the masses of employees, these propaganda and education had a great encouragement to the masses of employees, so that many people understood that to build the motherland, we must work hard and obey the needs of the state. Many workers expressed their obedience to the state's transfer. They said: "For the Five-Year Plan, we will go wherever we are needed." Guo Jia, a worker in the General Mechanical Room, proposed to ensure that he would do three good things in the streamlining work: study well when transferred for study, work well when transferred to brother factories, and complete tasks well when staying in the factory.

    In the process of streamlining, we also criticized the "dumping baggage" mentality of trying to send some not-so-good workers out among the employees, and stipulated that a certain number of backbones should be guaranteed when drawing employees. This approach also reversed the thinking of the masses of employees who thought that "redundancy is not honorable" and were afraid of becoming "redundant cadres."

    After the ideological level of the masses of employees was improved, they actively exposed the phenomenon of personnel waste, demanded a reduction in personnel, and put forward suggestions for improving work. Chang Shouchi, a young coal washing worker, proposed to see more machines. Oil and gas trough workers in the coking workshop, one for A furnace and one for B furnace, each worked less than three hours a day. They proposed that one person should manage two furnaces at the same time. The leaders have adopted this suggestion. In the past, there were 12 workers per shift for loading coal in the coking furnace. The workshop leaders had no idea in their minds and emphasized that "the work is tiring, the furnace is too hot, and the number of people can no longer be reduced." But after the workers discussed it, they thought that only ten people per shift were enough.

    In this streamlining, the Party committee and the administrative side conscientiously arranged the work, study, and life problems of the transferred personnel. Some of the transferred personnel will be transferred to brother factories and mines. We try our best to take care of the family problems and living problems of the output personnel, such as assisting workers in sending their families back to their hometowns, and the family members remaining in the factory still enjoy the original treatment in terms of coal distribution and medical care. In continuous production units, we organize workers into four major shifts. Each shift of workers still works eight hours, but the production time is only six hours, and the remaining two hours are for study time. If there is a transfer task, one shift can be drawn at any time, and the remaining three shifts will cancel the study time, and each shift will still work eight hours. In addition to more than 60 people serving as teachers in spare-time schools, more than 500 transferred staff members are organized to participate in professional studies (learning professional knowledge of enterprise management, accounting, statistics, production process, etc.) according to their original job nature. If there is no transfer task after the study, they will return to their jobs, and another batch will be transferred to study. Most of the old, weak, sick, and disabled workers have also been assigned to relatively light work.

    At present, our task is, on the one hand, to supervise and help the administrative side to do a good job in various organizational tasks, such as the rational allocation of personnel, the organization of production work, and the implementation of post operation procedures; on the other hand, to further deepen political and ideological work. A small number of employees are not stable enough in their emotions due to considering personal interests, and some ask to be transferred out, and some are afraid of transfer. The Party organization should continue to educate them so that they consciously subordinate personal interests to overall interests and current interests to long-term interests. At the same time, it is necessary to organize employees to study well, inspire employees' enthusiasm for learning, and enable them to complete the study plan within a certain period of time in accordance with the study system, so as to lay the foundation for preparing to support new factories and continuously improving labor productivity at any time.

    充分发动群众，保证完成整编任务
    中共石景山钢铁厂委员会
    今年三月，中共北京市委指示我们要大力整顿劳动组织，消灭人浮于事的现象。根据市委的指示，我们反复地摸底算账，七月间，正式进行整顿编制精简机构工作。七月底，整编工作告一段落。这次整编，由于我们认真地贯彻了上级党委的指示，并发动群众讨论，精简职工人数占全体职工总数的百分之二十八点八六，超过了上级领导机关原颁发指标的百分之十五点五。这样，预计一九五五年全员劳动生产率可比一九五四年提高百分之二十七点七。仅工资和附加工资一项，从七月二十日到年底，即可为国家节约一百二十三万元。这次整编着重减少了非生产工人，辅助工人和一般工作人员，取消了不必要的职能机构如厂长办公室，取消了过去不做具体工作的职能组长一级编制，以及车间的一些不必要的职能人员。在主要生产部门，则组织四班，增加工人在职学习时间，国家需要时，可随时抽调其中一班。到八月底为止，抽调出来的工人，有的已输送到兄弟厂矿。各主要车间已开始编为四班。有些减了人的车间，工作安排得比较合理，群众情绪很好，劳动生产率有显著的提高。七、八月份的生产计划都超额完成。
    过去，石景山钢铁厂机构庞大，人浮于事的现象很严重。一九五四年生产总值比一九五二年仅增加百分之十九点六四，全年平均在册人数却比一九五二年增加了百分之二十五点五；其中非生产人员比重增加很大，一九五四年非生产人员已占生产工人的百分之十四点八。因此，虽然生产工人劳动生产率有所提高，但是全员劳动生产率一九五四年反而比一九五二年降低了百分之四点六七。
    机构庞大，人浮于事，表现在很多方面。例如层次过多，工作重复。厂一级的职能机构已有二十二个，而车间还设立了种类繁多的职能组和职能员，全厂仅职能组长就有一百四十七个，其中科室的八十四个职能组长大部分都不做具体工作，每天只是“布置布置、检查检查、督促督促”。据不完全统计，全厂的生产组长中有九十一名脱离生产（按原来规定，组长是不应该脱离生产的）。这些人都是高级技术工人，脱离了生产，实际上并没有多少事情可做，工人和他们自己都很有意见。又如分工过细，机动力量过大。技术安全科设有八个区域检查员和四个专业检查员，区域检查员只管反映情况，专业检查员下去解决问题。技术教育科全科十四人，每天平均只处理二、三件文件，却设有事务、文书和统计三人。处理文件时，文书看后转科长，科长批后交文书，文书再转给事务员（事务员专管收发保管文件）。统计员根本没什么工作可做。在不少单位，一个人可以做的事往往设上两个人，甚至三、四个人。如车间还设有没有什么固定工作的机动队，仅炼铁部就有二百三十四人，人们说这是“人力仓库”。
    因为机构庞大臃肿，公文多表报多会议多的现象也随着而来。据统计，今年一至五月厂里发出的通知就达一百八十二件，签呈三百三十九件，发文五百七十九件，其中有很多是不必要的。全厂有原始记录一千多种，其中有不少是可以取消或简化的。各科室上有科务会，下有组务会，有时还要开组长联席会，很多日常工作都拿到会议上来解决，浪费时间，影响干部深入下层。
    为什么会造成这种情况呢？主要原因是我们对提高劳动生产率的重大意义认识不足，缺乏全面完成计划的观念，觉得成本中的工资部分比重很小，增加几个工人算不得什么，甚至认为“人多好办事”。因此，我们一说增产就要增加人，而不注意合理地组织劳动力和改善工作方法。如一九五二年为了准备迎接本厂扩建发展的需要，就盲目地大量增加人员，以致年底比年初增加了一千七百八十五人，实际上当时根本不需要增加人员。加上我们对国家的劳动政策学习和掌握不够，同时对工作缺乏分析研究，厂里长期不以全员而仅以生产工人来计算劳动生产率，以至长期没有发现全员劳动生产率降低的情况，造成了大量浪费劳动力的恶果。
    这次整编工作所以能够比较顺利地进行，主要是因为领导方面抓紧了以下几方面的工作。
    领导方面对整编工作下了最大的决心并进行了细致的调查研究工作。整编工作刚开始时，中层领导工作人员对人力浪费的严重现象认识不足，对通过整编改进工作、提高工作效率的精神领会不够，普遍喊叫困难。因此第一次算账时，全厂提出的精简数字很保守，只占职工总数的百分之十点六。第二次提高到百分之二十二点八，而到第三次、第四次讨论时，却又下降到百分之十八点六。在这种情况下，党委采取了种种措施，坚决贯彻中央和市委关于整编工作的指示。我们组织干部学习了列宁关于提高劳动生产率的文章，使大家懂得提高劳动生产率的重大意义，批判了各级干部认为只有增加人员才能增加生产的错误思想。
    同时，党委参照了兄弟厂的先进的定员标准，研究了本厂的情况，肯定当时提出的整编数字是保守的。经过反复地调查研究，领导方面又提出了新的精简指标，责成各级领导工作人员坚决贯彻。在提出新的整编指标时，领导方面曾经研究了苏联黑色冶金企业职员和工程技术人员的定员标准，和兄弟厂矿的先进定员标准，研究了本厂的劳动测定资料；同时把全厂职工的工作负荷量在相互间进行了比较，找出先进的，用以说服和教育落后的。
    整编工作中，领导常是落后于群众的。整编开始时，有些领导工作人员强调“干部水平低，人多好办事”；有些人想用“推任务”的办法把人员减下来；有的只是向上级“要根据、讲价钱”。在这种情况下，只有放手发动群众，整编工作才能顺利进行。但是整编工作开始时，也有不少工人有思想顾虑。例如有的职工害怕“人少了，留下的人、活加重了”；有的人不愿意调到远的地方去工作，有的人怕当“编余干部”，认为编余人员不光荣，有的人因为在旧社会受尽失业的痛苦，听说整编就害怕。针对这些思想，党组织首先向工人说明四个道理：第一，说明为了实现国家第一个五年计划，国家要建设许多新厂矿，现有厂矿的职工必须服从国家需要，随时准备支援新建厂矿。第二，给职工算了一笔账，让大家明白提高劳动生产率对国家的好处，说明精确地计算劳动时间，提高劳动生产率就是最重要的一项节约。第三，说明建设社会主义要靠我们艰苦的劳动，并提出我厂由于人员过多，平均工资逐年上升，而劳动生产率反而下降，这种不合理的现象给国家造成的损失是很大的。第四，指出全厂职工文化、技术水平低的情况，说明整编以后通过组织工人学习，可以提高大家的文化、技术水平。同时又因为我们向职工群众交代了政策，所以这些宣传教育，对职工群众的鼓舞很大，使很多人懂得了要建设祖国就必须艰苦奋斗，服从国家需要。很多工人都表示服从国家调动。他们说：“五年大建设，那儿需要那儿去。”总机械室工人郭嘉，提出保证在整编工作中做到三好，调学习学好，调兄弟厂工作工作好，留在厂完成任务好。
    在整编工作过程中，我们还在职工中批判了那种企图把一些不太好的工人往外送的“卸包袱”思想，规定抽调职工时应保证有一定数量的骨干。这种做法，同时扭转了职工群众认为“编余不光荣”，怕当“编余干部”的思想。
    职工群众的思想水平提高以后，积极地揭发了人员浪费现象，要求削减人员，并提出改进工作的意见。青年洗煤工人常守志提出要求多看机器。炼焦车间油气槽工，甲炉乙炉各一人，每人每天工作不到三小时，他们提出一人兼管两个炉子的建议，这个建议领导方面已经采纳。炼焦炉装煤工人，过去每班十二人，车间领导上心中无数，强调“工作累，炉上太热，人不能再减了。”但经过工人们讨论后，认为每班只有十个人就够了。
    在这次整编中，党委和行政方面认真地安排被抽调人员的工作、学习和生活问题。抽调出来的人员有一部分要向兄弟厂矿输送。对输出人员的家庭问题、生活问题我们都尽量予以照顾，如协助工人送家眷回老家，留厂的家属在配煤、医药等方面也还享受原来的待遇等。在连续生产的单位，我们把工人组织成四大班，每班工人上班时间仍为八小时，生产时间则只六小时，其余二小时为学习时间。如有输送任务，随时可抽出一班，其余三班取消学习时间，每班仍工作八小时。还有五百多名被抽调的职员，除六十多人担任业余学校教员外，其余的都根据他们原来的工作性质，组织他们参加专业学习
  （学习企业管理、会计、统计、生产过程等专业知识），学习后如无输送任务，即回到工作岗位，另换一批学习。一部分老弱病残的工人，也大都分别分配了比较轻的工作。
    目前我们的任务是，一方面监督并帮助行政方面做好各项组织工作，如人员的合理配置，生产工作的组织，岗位操作规程的贯彻等；一方面使政治思想工作进一步深入下去。少数职工由于计较个人利益，情绪不够安定，有的要求调出，有的害怕调动。党组织应该继续教育他们，使他们自觉地把个人利益服从整体利益，当前利益服从长远利益，同时要好好组织职工学习，启发职工的学习热情，使他们按照学习制度在一定时期内，完成学习计划，为随时准备支援新厂和不断地提高劳动生产率打下基础。
