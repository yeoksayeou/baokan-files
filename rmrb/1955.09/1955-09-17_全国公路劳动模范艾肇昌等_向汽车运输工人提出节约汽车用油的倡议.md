National highway labor models Ai Zhaochang and Yang Maolin, both motor vehicle transportation workers from Beijing, and Beijing industrial labor model and motor vehicle transportation worker Ge Zhengzhong, jointly proposed an initiative to motor vehicle transportation workers nationwide on September 7th, advocating for the conservation of automotive fuel.

The initiative stated: During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the task of motor vehicle transportation workers is to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the national transportation plan, practice strict economy, and reduce transportation costs. Among these efforts, conserving automotive fuel (gasoline, diesel) holds particular importance. This is because gasoline and diesel are vital materials for national construction, and also because they constitute a large proportion of transportation costs. Conserving automotive fuel will not only reduce transportation costs but also free up more gasoline and diesel for uses urgently needed in national construction.

In their initiative, Ai Zhaochang and others put forward five suggestions to motor vehicle transportation workers across the country: (1) Strive to improve driving skills, consistently maintain economical driving speeds, strictly control the normal operating temperature of the engine and the normal tire pressure, and strengthen maintenance to keep vehicles in good technical condition at all times. This will ensure further reduction in the consumption of gasoline and diesel based on the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of transportation tasks. (2) Diligently study the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and China in conserving gasoline and diesel to reduce automotive fuel consumption. Promote the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, helping comrades who fail to meet quotas to master operations and improve their skills to meet the quota standards. (3) Resolutely implement dispatching plans, reduce empty vehicle runs, and promote truck-and-trailer transport to improve transportation efficiency and accomplish more transportation tasks with less gasoline and diesel. (4) Actively support and promote the correct measures of using substitutes such as coal, charcoal, and firewood as automobile fuels, and take the initiative to learn and improve the experience of using substitute fuel vehicles to save automotive fuel. (5) Strictly abide by the system of oil distribution, storage, and use, refrain from using gasoline for washing hands or tools, reduce non-productive fuel consumption, and avoid wasting even a drop of gasoline and diesel.

In their initiative, they also set out their own conservation plans. Ai Zhaochang pledged to save 1,798 liters of gasoline this year; Yang Maolin pledged to save 731 liters of diesel; and Ge Zhengzhong pledged to save 6,198 kilograms of coal.

The Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the National Committee of the China Highway Transportation Trade Union jointly issued instructions on the conservation of automotive fuel and the effective promotion of fuel-saving experiences on the 10th, calling on motor vehicle transportation workers nationwide to respond to the initiative of Ai Zhaochang and others. The instructions also require administrative and trade union organizations at all levels to mobilize all transportation workers to improve driving skills, strengthen vehicle maintenance, and save automotive fuel on the basis of comprehensively completing and overfulfilling transportation tasks.

    全国公路劳动模范艾肇昌等
    向汽车运输工人提出节约汽车用油的倡议
    全国公路劳动模范、北京市汽车运输工人艾肇昌、杨茂林，北京市工业劳动模范、汽车运输工人葛正中，在九月七日联名向全国汽车运输工人提出了节约汽车用油的倡议。
    倡议中说：在第一个五年计划期间，汽车运输工人的任务，是保证完成和超额完成国家运输计划，厉行节约，降低运输成本。在厉行节约中，节约汽车用油（汽油、柴油）具有特殊重要的意义。因为汽油、柴油是国家建设的重要物资，同时，汽油、柴油在运输成本中也占很大比重，节约汽车用油，不但能降低运输成本，并且可以节约更多的汽油和柴油用到国家建设迫切需要的用途上去。
    艾肇昌等在倡议中向全国汽车运输工人提出了五点建议：（一）努力提高驾驶技术，经常保持行车的经济速度，严格掌握发动机正常温度和轮胎的正常气压，并加强保养，使车辆技术状况经常良好，从而达到在全面完成和超额完成运输任务的基础上进一步降低汽油、柴油的消耗。（二）认真地学习苏联的和中国的节约汽油、柴油先进经验，减少汽车用油。发扬互助友爱精神，帮助完不成定额的同志熟练操作，提高技术，达到定额标准。（三）坚决执行调度计划，减少车辆跑空，推行汽车拖载运输，从提高运输效率着手，做到用少量的汽油和柴油完成更多的运输任务。（四）积极拥护和推行用煤、木炭、木柴等代用品作为汽车燃料的正确措施，主动学习和提高使用代燃车的经验，以节约汽车用油。（五）严格地遵守油料领发、保管和使用等制度，不用汽油洗手、洗工具等，减少非生产用油，不浪费点滴汽油和柴油。
    在倡议中他们还订出了自己的节约计划。艾肇昌保证今年节约汽油一千七百九十八公升；杨茂林节约柴油七百三十一公升；葛正中节约煤炭六千一百九十八公斤。
    交通部公路总局、中国公路运输工会全国委员会，已在十日联合发出了关于节约汽车用油、切实推广节油经验的指示，号召全国汽车运输工人响应艾肇昌等的倡议。指示并要求各级行政、工会组织发动全体运输工人在全面完成和超额完成运输任务的基础上，提高驾驶技术，加强车辆保养，节约汽车用油。（新华社）
