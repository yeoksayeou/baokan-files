Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 17th: TASS reports that "Pravda" published an article by Mayevsky on the 17th, again raising the issue of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

The article stated: The upcoming tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly faces the important and lofty task of consolidating the "Spirit of Geneva" and taking decisive steps to promote international trust and mutual understanding. In this regard, the immediate restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is of particularly great significance, because the People's Republic of China is a large country that makes extremely important contributions to the cause of maintaining peace and the security of the people of the Far East and the world.

The article went on to point out that since its founding, the People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a policy of maintaining peace and friendship with other countries in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Many diplomatic activities of the Chinese People's Government have once again emphasized its outstanding role in international relations. Without taking into account the interests of great China, no major international problem in Asia can be properly resolved. It is unjust and intolerable that powerful China is still being prevented from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations. This situation can only directly undermine the prestige of the United Nations and cause it great damage.

The article said that a considerable number of reactionary American newspapers are still despicably slandering China. For example, the "Daily News" demanded that the Eisenhower administration "continue to obstruct" "all attempts" to guarantee China's rights in the United Nations.

However, some American politicians and business people are increasingly advocating a sober assessment of the current situation, demanding an end to the futile policy of obstruction against China. The influential American newspaper "Wall Street Journal" reflected the sentiments of these people, writing: "There is no shame in changing policies when the premises on which the former policies were based have changed. It is now quite clear that the previous, simpler way of 'containing' Communist China may not be beneficial to the United States."

The article then pointed out that there can be no two opinions that easing tensions in Asia is inseparable from improving Sino-American relations.

The article concluded by saying that it is quite obvious that immediately restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations would be the best contribution to consolidating the "Spirit of Geneva," easing international tensions, and safeguarding peace. Delaying, especially obstructing the resolution of this issue, is deliberately undermining the "Spirit of Geneva" and the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding among nations.

    “真理报”载文论我国在联合国中的合法权利
    新华社十七日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十七日刊载了马耶夫斯基的一篇文章，再次提出关于中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题。
    文章写道：即将举行的联合国大会第十届会议面临着重大的和崇高的任务——巩固“日内瓦的精神”以及采取促进国际信任和相互谅解的坚决步骤。在这方面，立即恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利具有特别重大的意义，因为中华人民共和国是一个大国，它对维护和平以及远东和世界各国人民安全的事业有极其重大的贡献。
    文章接着指出，中华人民共和国从它成立的最初日子起，始终不渝地奉行着符合联合国宪章原则的维护和平和同其他国家友好的政策。中国人民政府的许多外交活动又一次着重说明了它在国际关系中所起的卓越作用。如果没有考虑到伟大中国的利益，亚洲任何重大的国际问题都是不能得到良好的解决的。强大的中国至今仍被阻挠取得它在联合国中的合法地位，这是不公正的和不能容忍的。这种情况只能直接破坏联合国的威信和给它以巨大损害。
    文章说，相当一部分美国反动报纸目前仍旧在卑劣地诬蔑中国。例如，“每日新闻”要求艾森豪威尔政府“仍旧要阻挠”保障中国在联合国权利的“一切企图”。
    然而，有一些美国政界人士和商业界人士却日益主张清醒地估计现在的局势，要求结束对中国实行的徒然的阻挠政策。有影响的美国报纸“华尔街日报”反映了这些人士的情绪，它写道：“当实行从前的政策的前提已经改变了的时候，改变政策是没有什么可耻的。已经十分明显，以前那种比较简单的‘抑制’共产党中国的方式未必对美国有好处。”
    文章接着指出，缓和亚洲紧张局势同改进中美关系问题是分不开的，在这一点上不能有两种意见。
    文章最后说，十分明显，立刻恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，这在巩固“日内瓦精神”方面，在缓和国际紧张局势和保障和平方面都会是最好的贡献。拖延，尤其是阻挠这个问题的解决就是故意破坏“日内瓦精神”，破坏各国的合作和相互谅解的精神。
