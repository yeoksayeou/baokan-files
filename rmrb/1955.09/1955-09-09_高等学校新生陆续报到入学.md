University freshmen recruited and admitted through the unified national entrance examination are registering for enrollment in schools one after another.

This year, national universities and colleges admitted more than 96,200 new students, including more than 55,000 students in science and engineering.

This year, the unified national college entrance examination work earnestly implemented the policy of "ensuring quality and taking care of quantity," completed the enrollment plan, and the quality of the admitted freshmen has generally improved. In North China, 1,738 industrial workers, worker-peasant cadres, demobilized construction soldiers, and on-the-job cadres were admitted to various schools during the enrollment process. The examination scores of students in all subjects have generally improved compared to the past. The average examination score of students admitted to Tsinghua University this year reached 77 points in all subjects, and the average examination score of students admitted to Peking University reached 72 points in all subjects.

Due to the improved quality of candidates this year, the total number of new students admitted nationwide this year has increased by more than 3,900 compared to the original plan.

The vast majority of new students admitted to various universities and colleges this year will be enrolled in the schools and majors they have chosen. A small number of students who meet the admission standards have been appropriately assigned to schools and majors with vacancies.
