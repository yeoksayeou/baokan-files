Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 18th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Vice Premier Fan Wen-dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delivered an important report on behalf of the government at the Fifth Session of the National Assembly of Vietnam, which opened on the 15th.

The report consists of two main parts and a conclusion. The first part is: Continue the struggle to achieve the implementation of the Geneva Accords, consolidate peace, and achieve national reunification on the basis of independence and democracy and through peaceful means. This part is divided into three chapters.

The first chapter is entitled: The Geneva Accords Must Be Respected and Strictly Implemented. In this chapter, Fan Wen-dong reiterated the firm and unwavering position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people in respecting and strictly implementing the Geneva Accords. He also strongly protested against the planned and serious activities of the American imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in sabotaging the Geneva Accords, particularly their obstruction of political consultations aimed at preparing for free general elections. At the same time, he criticized the ambiguous attitude of the French government and pointed out that France has an obligation to fulfill the Geneva Accords.

Fan Wen-dong said: The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that the signatory states and the states participating in the Geneva Conference, as well as all member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, should guarantee the correct implementation of these agreements on the cessation of hostilities and on political settlement.

The second chapter is entitled: Achieving the Reunification of Vietnam on the Basis of Independence and Democracy and Through Peaceful Means. Fan Wen-dong pointed out that the struggle to consolidate peace and achieve unification requires a very broad national united front and a common program that is highly adapted to the current political situation in Vietnam, in order to isolate and defeat American imperialism and its running dogs, and to advance towards the establishment of a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam.

Fan Wen-dong said that such a broad united front has been established, and it is the Vietnam Fatherland Front; and such a program has been unanimously adopted at the recent National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front. He then said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly welcomes the newly established Vietnam Fatherland Front and its program.

Fan Wen-dong pointed out that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has clearly stated its readiness to hold a consultation conference and has clarified its position on the main issues to be discussed at this conference.

Fan Wen-dong emphasized that the authorities in South Vietnam face two paths: One path is that the authorities in South Vietnam accept the proposals of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam based on the will of the people and agree to convene a consultation conference. Then, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will gladly use a spirit of understanding and reconciliation to study and discuss all the issues raised by the authorities in South Vietnam in order to reach an agreement for the supreme interests of the motherland and the people. The other path is that the authorities in South Vietnam are determined to follow American imperialism, continue to undermine the Geneva Accords, refuse consultations and general elections, shamelessly sell out the motherland, and act as running dogs of imperialism in an attempt to divide Vietnam and prepare to provoke a new war. The first path is a glorious path. The second path is a path full of crimes, and it will surely lead the authorities in South Vietnam to a complete defeat.

Fan Wen-dong also condemned the argument often put forward by American imperialism and international reactionaries that if consultation conferences and free general elections are held, North Vietnam will surely defeat South Vietnam. Fan Wen-dong said that this is a provocative and divisive argument aimed at undermining the national reunification movement of the Vietnamese people. The basic issue here is not whether North Vietnam or South Vietnam wins. The basic issue is that North Vietnam and South Vietnam should reach an agreement on the issue of unifying Vietnam.

The third chapter is entitled: The Foreign Policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Fan Wen-dong pointed out that although the international tension has generally eased somewhat, due to the United States' policy of interfering in the internal affairs of Far Eastern countries, the situation in the Far East, especially in Indochina, remains tense.

Fan Wen-dong continued: In order to resolve this tense situation, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the policy of the government of the People's Republic of China to liberate Taiwan, the policy of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to unify Korea, the struggle of the Indian people and the Indonesian people to resolve the Goa issue and the struggle to resolve the West Irian issue in line with their legitimate national interests. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly endorse the proposal put forward by China to convene a conference attended by Asian countries and relevant countries in order to solve the current difficult problems and to enable countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to sign a collective peace treaty to replace all existing military alliances.

He added: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is determined to further strengthen friendly relations, solidarity, and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries.

Fan Wen-dong continued that, with regard to Southeast Asian countries, especially India, Burma, and Indonesia, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to establish and develop friendly relations with them on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Fan Wen-dong said that, with regard to Cambodia and Laos, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently pursued a policy of good neighborliness and has always respected the neutral status of these two countries in the spirit of the Geneva Accords. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam guarantees to establish friendly relations with Cambodia and Laos on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Fan Wen-dong said that, with regard to France, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam advocates establishing and developing diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

The second part of the report is: Strive to restore the national economy in order to promote the consolidation of North Vietnam.

In this part, Fan Wen-dong reviewed the achievements made by the Vietnamese people in the economic and financial fields over the past year of peace restoration, and talked about several main issues in economic recovery.

Fan Wen-dong said that the goal and requirements of economic recovery are: to complete the two-year economic recovery plan, the main purpose of which is to raise the production level to the level of the pre-war period (the level of 1939) by the end of 1956, in order to heal the wounds of war, alleviate the people's difficulties, and gradually improve the people's material and spiritual life, thereby laying the foundation for consolidating the North from an economic, political, and defense point of view, while giving appropriate attention to the South, and laying the foundation for future planned economic development.

Fan Wen-dong then said that the main task of this two-year plan is to restore the economy, but if we have the necessary conditions, we should also develop the economy, for example in the industrial sector.

Fan Wen-dong pointed out that, while restoring the economy, reforms and adjustments should be carried out. For example, we will restore agricultural production on the basis of land reform; as for industry and commerce, adjustments should be made while restoring them. He also pointed out that, in economic recovery, special attention should be paid to restoring agricultural production, and the restoration of other sectors and the entire national economy must rely on the restoration of agricultural production.

Fan Wen-dong said: The purpose of economic recovery is to gradually improve the people's living standards. We must measure the results of economic recovery through the people's living standards.

Finally, in the conclusion of the report, Fan Wen-dong said that since the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been striving on the one hand to strictly implement the Geneva Accords and on the other hand to restore the national economy; both of the above tasks have generally produced good results. Today, we must continue to carry out these two tasks in the current specific political situation in Vietnam and the world.

Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will become increasingly strong, and the struggle of the Vietnamese people to consolidate peace, strive for unification, and guarantee the complete independence and democracy of the country will surely be victorious. Vietnam will surely become a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong country.

    范文同副总理在国民大会上作重要报告
    新华社河内十八日讯　据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国副总理范文同在十五日开幕的越南国民大会第五次会议上，代表政府作了一个重要的报告。
    报告共分两个主要部分和一个结语。它的第一部分是：继续进行争取履行日内瓦协定的斗争，巩固和平，在独立和民主的基础上并且通过和平方式实现国家的统一。在这一部分中，又分三章。
    第一章的题目是：必须尊重和严格履行日内瓦协定。范文同在这一章中再一次申明了越南民主共和国政府和越南人民尊重和严格履行日内瓦协定的坚定不移的立场。他并且强硬抗议美帝国主义和吴庭艳政权有计划地和严重地破坏日内瓦协定的活动，特别是它们阻挠目的在为自由普选进行准备的政治协商。同时，他还批评了法国政府的暧昧态度，并且指出法国有义务履行日内瓦协定。
    范文同说：越南人民和越南民主共和国政府认为，日内瓦协定的签字国和参加日内瓦会议的国家以及国际监督和监察委员会的全体委员国，应当保证正确执行关于停止敌对行动的以及关于政治解决的这些协定。
    第二章的题目是：在独立和民主的基础上并且通过和平方式来实现越南的统一。范文同指出，争取巩固和平和实现统一的斗争需要一个非常广泛的民族统一战线和一个十分适应目前越南政治局势的共同纲领，以便孤立和击退美帝国主义及其走狗，并且向建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣和强大的越南前进。
    范文同说，这样一个广泛的统一战线已经建立起来，它就是越南祖国战线；而这样一个纲领也已在最近的越南民族统一战线全国大会上一致通过。他接着说，越南民主共和国政府热烈欢迎新成立的越南祖国战线和它的纲领。
    范文同指出，越南民主共和国政府已经清楚说明它准备举行一个协商会议，并且阐明了它对在这个会议上所要讨论的主要问题的立场。
    范文同着重指出，在越南南方当局面前摆着两条路：一条路是，南方当局根据人民的意愿而接受越南民主共和国政府的建议并且同意召开一个协商会议，那末，越南民主共和国政府一定会欣然用一种谅解和和解的精神来同南方当局研究和讨论他们所提出来的一切问题，以便为了祖国和人民的最高利益而达成协议；另一条路是，南方当局决心追随美帝国主义，继续破坏日内瓦协定，拒绝协商和普选，无耻地出卖祖国并且去充当帝国主义的走狗，以图分割越南并且准备挑起新的战争。第一条路是一条光荣的道路。第二条路是一条充满罪恶的道路，而且一定会把南方当局引上一败涂地的局面。
    范文同还斥责了美帝国主义和国际反动派时常提出的论调：如果举行协商会议和自由普选，北越一定会击败南越。范文同说，这是旨在破坏越南人民的全国统一运动的挑拨性和具有分裂作用的论调。这里的基本问题不是北越或是南越得胜的问题。基本问题是北越和南越应当对有关统一越南的问题达成协议。
    第三章的题目是：越南民主共和国的外交政策。范文同指出：虽然一般讲来国际紧张局势已经多少缓和了些，但是由于美国的干涉远东国家内政的政策，远东的局势，特别是印度支那的局势，仍然是紧张的。
    范文同继续说：为了解决这种紧张局势，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府完全支持中华人民共和国政府的解放台湾的政策、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的统一朝鲜的政策、符合印度人民和印度尼西亚人民的正当民族利益的争取解决果阿问题的斗争和争取解决西伊里安问题的斗争。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府热烈赞同中国提出的这种建议：召开一个由亚洲国家和有关国家参加的会议，以便解决目前的困难问题，使亚洲和太平洋地区的国家签订一个集体和平条约，以代替现有的一切军事联盟。
    他又说：越南民主共和国政府决心进一步加强同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的友好关系、团结和互助。
    范文同继续说，对于东南亚国家，特别是印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚，越南民主共和国政府愿意在和平共处的五项原则的基础上同它们建立和发展友好关系。
    范文同说：对于柬埔寨和老挝，越南民主共和国政府一直推行善邻关系政策，始终按照日内瓦协定的精神尊重这两个国家的中立地位。越南民主共和国政府保证在和平共处的五项原则的基础上同柬埔寨和老挝建立友好关系。
    范文同说：对于法国，越南民主共和国政府主张在平等和互利的原则上建立和发展外交、经济和文化关系。
    报告的第二部分是：努力恢复国民经济以便推进巩固越南北方的工作。
    范文同在这一部分中回顾了和平恢复一年来越南人民在经济和财政方面所取得的成就，并且谈到了经济恢复中的几个主要问题。
    范文同说，经济恢复的目标和要求是：完成经济恢复两年计划，这个计划的主要目的是，到一九五六年底把生产水平提高到战前时期的水平（一九三九年的水平），以便医治战争创伤，减轻人民的困难，逐步改善人民的物质和精神生活，从而奠定从经济、政治和国防观点巩固北方的基础，同时给南方以适当的注意，并且为将来有计划的经济发展打下基础。
    范文同接着说，这个两年计划的主要任务是恢复经济，但是，如果我们有必要条件的话，我们同时也应该发展经济，例如在工业方面。
    范文同指出，在经济恢复的同时，应该进行改革和调整。例如，我们将在土地改革的基础上恢复农业生产；至于工业和商业，应该在恢复的同时进行调整。他还指出，在经济恢复中，应该特别注意恢复农业生产，而必须依靠恢复农业生产来恢复其他部门和整个国民经济。
    范文同说：经济恢复的目的在于逐步提高人民的生活水准。我们必须通过人民的生活水准来估量经济恢复的结果。
    范文同最后在报告的结语中说，自从和平恢复以来，越南民主共和国政府一直在一方面努力严格地履行日内瓦协定，一方面在努力恢复国民经济；上述两项任务，一般地说已经产生良好结果。今天，我们要在越南和全世界目前具体的政治形势下继续执行这两项任务。
    在胡志明主席的领导下，越南民主共和国将日益强大，越南人民巩固和平、争取统一和保证全国的完全独立和民主的斗争必将胜利，越南必将成为一个和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣和强大的国家。
