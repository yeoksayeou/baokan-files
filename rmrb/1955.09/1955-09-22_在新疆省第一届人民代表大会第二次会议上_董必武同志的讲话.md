Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

The Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province is being held to discuss the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. This is a major event of historical significance.

The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been approved by the 21st Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress believes that among the four million people in Xinjiang Province, the Uyghur ethnic group accounts for more than 74 percent, and the establishment of an autonomous region with the Uyghur ethnic group as the main body is in line with the country's ethnic policy. Now, after discussion and adoption by the Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will soon be established. I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the conference and the soon-to-be-established Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and hope that it will gloriously undertake the great historical task of uniting the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to strive for socialist construction and socialist transformation. We firmly believe that the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will surely encourage the Uyghur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang to further exert their enthusiasm and initiative and enthusiastically participate in the great socialist construction of the motherland.

The Uyghur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang are all hardworking and brave ethnic groups of the motherland and have a long history and splendid national culture. In ancient times, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang developed the vast areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, making Xinjiang one of the rich regions of the motherland and making important contributions to the creation of the great motherland. However, before liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang had long suffered from exploitation and oppression by the reactionary ruling class of the Han nationality. The ethnic oppression system caused very serious damage to the development of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In order to resist national oppression and strive for national liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have carried out heroic struggles. In particular, the revolution in the three districts of Ili, Ashan, and Tacheng gave a powerful blow to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in Xinjiang, effectively cooperated with the national liberation war, and promoted the peaceful liberation of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang under the rapid development of the national revolutionary situation. Since then, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, together with the people of the whole country, have been permanently freed from national oppression, realized national equality, and achieved broad prospects for development.

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have carried out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, suppressed the counter-revolutionary movement, completed the reform of the land system, launched an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and developed agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, transportation, and commerce. Work in the fields of culture, education, and health has also made progress. People's lives have gradually been improved and improved, and autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been established successively, strengthening national unity, cultivating a large number of ethnic minority cadres, and greatly improving the patriotic and socialist consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups. All of these have laid a good foundation for the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the planned development of economic and cultural undertakings in the autonomous region in the future.

The road to liberation for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region fully prove that the ethnic policy formulated by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong based on Marxism-Leninism is invincible. Since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has regarded the realization of equality and complete liberation of all ethnic groups within China as one of its main tasks, and has helped the liberation and development of minority ethnic groups in all aspects. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Comrades Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu and other comrades of the Communist Party of China gave their precious lives for the cause of liberation of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Their blood flowed together with the blood of the martyrs of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang who sacrificed for the revolutionary cause. After liberation, the achievements of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang in various tasks are also the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the care and support of the great motherland, and the close cooperation and joint struggle of the people of all ethnic groups and cadres of all ethnic groups.

The victory of the national people's great revolution and the establishment of a people's democratic regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance enable us to solve ethnic problems with a thorough democratic and ethnic equality spirit and establish genuine unity and cooperation among all ethnic groups. The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong regard ethnic regional autonomy as the basic policy for solving ethnic problems in our country, and this policy has been incorporated into our country's constitution. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China guarantees that all minority ethnic groups in our country can exercise autonomy in areas where they live in concentrated communities, be masters of their own affairs, and manage their internal affairs. We must unswervingly implement this policy, not only because we must respect the equal status and rights that all ethnic groups should enjoy, but also because only this policy can eliminate the estrangement and discrimination between ethnic groups that have been left over from history, and can continuously enhance mutual trust and unity among ethnic groups. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is another major victory for the Communist Party of China in promoting the policy of ethnic regional autonomy and another sign of greater unity among all ethnic groups in the motherland.

Now, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is about to be established. What should be the task of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang after the establishment of the autonomous region? Our task is to mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, realize the construction tasks of the Xinjiang region stipulated in the national plan, develop the politics, economy and culture of the autonomous region, continue to improve and improve the material and cultural lives of the people, cultivate a large number of cadres for various construction work, adhere to a broad united front, consolidate national defense, and build the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

After the establishment of the autonomous region, cadres of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang must work actively, study hard, overcome arrogance and impetuosity, be modest and prudent, further closely link with the masses, strengthen national unity, and dedicate all their strength to the interests of the motherland and the construction of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

In the process of developing their own politics, economy, and culture, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang must continue to welcome the support of all ethnic groups in the motherland, especially the Han people, and the help of Han cadres. Only in this way can our autonomous region be built better and faster. It is wrong and unacceptable to leave this help. And mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, especially the assistance of the Han people to other ethnic groups, should also be regarded as their due responsibility and obligation. It is wrong and unacceptable not to do so. The troops stationed in Xinjiang and Han cadres must serve the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang wholeheartedly with a selfless attitude. In order to build the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and consolidate national defense, they should work hard, work with peace of mind, and make greater and more achievements.

After the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, it is necessary not only to continue but also to strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation among all ethnic groups within the autonomous region. The Uyghur ethnic group, which accounts for the majority of the population, must especially actively help the autonomous prefectures, autonomous counties, and other ethnic people of other ethnic groups to build their own autonomous areas and their happy lives, so that the people of all ethnic groups can join hands more closely and build the autonomous region together.

Conducting patriotic and socialist education among cadres and the masses of the people very seriously, and preventing great-Han chauvinism and local nationalism tendencies, not only in the past but also in the future, remains a major task of the Party and the People's Government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

It must be pointed out that imperialism and all counter-revolutionary elements are extremely hostile to our socialist construction, to our national unity, and to all the achievements and victories achieved by the people of all ethnic groups. The enemy especially understands the importance of national unity to our country's socialist construction, and therefore they will inevitably use various methods to undermine our socialist construction and the unity among all ethnic groups. Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region, located on the border of the motherland, and now an autonomous region is about to be established. Then it is undoubtedly true that imperialism and all counter-revolutionary elements will inevitably find various gaps to carry out sabotage. We must raise revolutionary vigilance, consolidate our national unity, and eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements.

Representatives, you are all representatives of the people of all ethnic groups. You have a great responsibility for the socialist construction of the motherland and the construction of the autonomous region. We believe that you will be able to unite closely, strive for our common socialist construction cause, for the happy life of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and for the great motherland, and complete the tasks assigned to you by the motherland and the people.

### 在新疆省第一届人民代表大会第二次会议上  董必武同志的讲话

    在新疆省第一届人民代表大会第二次会议上
    董必武同志的讲话主席、各位代表：
    新疆省第一届人民代表大会第二次会议开会，是要讨论关于成立新疆维吾尔自治区的问题。这是一件有历史意义的大事。
    新疆维吾尔自治区，已经全国人民代表大会常务委员会第二十一次会议批准成立。全国人民代表大会常务委员会认为：新疆省四百多万人口中，维吾尔族占百分之七十四以上，以维吾尔族为主体成立自治区是符合国家的民族政策的。现在，经过新疆省第一届人民代表大会第二次会议的讨论和通过之后，新疆维吾尔自治区即将成立，我谨代表中国共产党中央委员会和中央人民政府向大会和即将成立的新疆维吾尔自治区致以衷心的祝贺，并希望它光荣地担负起团结新疆各民族人民为社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业而奋斗的伟大历史任务。我们深信：新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，一定能够鼓舞新疆维吾尔族和各民族人民进一步发挥其积极性和主动精神，热情地参加祖国伟大的社会主义建设。
    新疆维吾尔族和各民族都是祖国勤劳、勇敢的民族，并具有悠久的历史和灿烂的民族文化。在很早以前，新疆各民族人民就开发了天山南北的广大地区，从事农业、畜牧业生产，使新疆成为祖国富饶的地区之一，对伟大祖国的缔造，作出了重要的贡献。但是，在解放前新疆各民族曾长期遭受汉族反动统治阶级的剥削和压迫。民族压迫制度对新疆各民族的发展造成了十分严重的损害。为了反抗民族压迫，争取民族解放，新疆各民族人民曾进行了英勇的斗争。特别是伊犁、阿山、塔城三区的革命，给了国民党在新疆的反动统治以有力的打击，有力地配合了全国的解放战争，并在全国革命形势的迅速发展下，促使新疆各民族人民获得了和平解放。从此，新疆各民族人民便同全国人民一起，永远摆脱了民族压迫，实现了民族平等，取得了广阔的发展前途。
    几年来，新疆各民族人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，进行了抗美援朝运动，进行了镇压反革命运动，完成了土地制度的改革工作，开展了以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，发展了农业、畜牧业、工业、交通运输和商业，在文化、教育、卫生各个方面的工作也都有了进展，人民生活已逐步地得到改善和提高，并先后建立了新疆境内各民族自治州和自治县，增强了民族团结，培养了大批的民族干部，大大地提高了各民族人民的爱国主义和社会主义觉悟。所有这些都为成立新疆维吾尔自治区和今后在自治区内有计划地发展经济和文化事业，打下了良好的基础。
    新疆各民族人民获得解放的道路和新疆维吾尔自治区的建立，充分证明了中国共产党和毛泽东主席根据马克思列宁主义制定的民族政策是无往而不胜利的。中国共产党成立以来，即以实现中国境内各民族一律平等和彻底解放作为自己的主要任务之一，并从各方面帮助少数民族的解放和发展。在国民党反动统治时期，中国共产党人陈潭秋、毛泽民、林基路等同志为了新疆各民族人民的解放事业，曾经付出了他们宝贵的生命。他们的鲜血是同新疆各民族人民中为革命事业而牺牲了的先烈们的鲜血流在一起的。解放后，新疆各民族人民在各项工作中的成绩，也是在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在伟大祖国的关怀和支援下，依靠各民族人民和各民族干部亲密合作共同奋斗的结果。
    全国人民大革命的胜利和以工人阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权的建立，使我们能够以彻底的民主主义和民族平等精神解决民族问题，建立各民族的真正团结和合作。中国共产党和毛泽东主席把民族的区域自治作为解决我国民族问题的基本政策，这一政策已载入我国的宪法。中华人民共和国宪法保证了我国各少数民族在聚居的地方都能行使自治权，当家作主，管理本民族内部事务。我们须坚定不移地贯彻这个政策，这不仅是因为我们必须尊重各民族应该享有的平等地位和权利，而且只有这个政策，才能消除历史上残留下来的各民族间的隔阂和歧视，才能不断地增进各民族间的互相信任和团结。毫无疑问，新疆维吾尔自治区的建立，是中国共产党推行民族区域自治政策的又一重大胜利，是祖国各民族更加团结的又一标志。
    现在，新疆维吾尔自治区即将成立了，自治区成立之后，新疆各民族人民的任务应该是什么呢？我们的任务就是动员新疆各民族人民，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设，实现国家计划中规定的新疆地区的建设任务，发展自治区的政治、经济和文化，继续改善和提高人民的物质和文化生活，大量培养各项建设工作的干部，坚持广泛的统一战线，巩固国防，建设新疆维吾尔自治区。
    在自治区成立之后，新疆各民族干部，必须积极工作，努力学习，戒骄戒躁，虚心谨慎，进一步地密切联系群众，加强民族团结，为着祖国的利益，为着新疆维吾尔自治区的建设献出自己一切力量。
    新疆各民族在发展自己的政治、经济和文化的工作中，还须继续欢迎祖国各民族特别是汉族人民的支援和汉族干部的帮助，这样才能使我们的自治区更快地建设好，离开这样的帮助是不对的，也是不行的。而各民族间的互相帮助，特别是汉族对其他民族的帮助，也都应该认为这是自己应尽的责任和义务，不这样作是不对的，也是不行的。驻新疆部队和汉族干部必须以忘我的态度全心全意地为新疆各民族人民服务，为了建设新疆维吾尔自治区和巩固国防，应该努力工作，安心工作，并且做出更大更多的成绩来。
    新疆维吾尔自治区成立之后，不仅要继续并且还要加强自治区内各民族间的互助合作。占人口多数的维吾尔族特别要积极地来帮助其他民族的自治州、自治县和其他民族人民建设他们自己的自治地方和他们的幸福生活，使得各民族人民更亲密地携起手来，共同来建设自治区。
    十分认真地在干部中和人民群众中进行爱国主义和社会主义的教育，防止大民族主义和地方民族主义倾向，不仅过去是并且今后仍然是新疆维吾尔自治区的党和人民政府的重大任务。
    必须指出，帝国主义和一切反革命分子，对我国的社会主义建设、对我们的民族团结、对各民族人民所获得的一切成就和胜利都是极端仇恨的，敌人特别懂得民族团结对我国进行社会主义建设的重要意义，因而他们必将利用各种办法来破坏我国的社会主义建设和各民族间的团结。新疆是多民族的地区，处在祖国的边境，现在又将建立自治区，那末帝国主义和一切反革命分子必然会寻找我们的各种空隙来进行破坏是毫无疑问的。我们必须提高革命警惕性，巩固我们的民族团结，肃清一切反革命分子。
    各位代表：你们都是各民族人民的代表，对于祖国的社会主义建设，对于自治区的建设，你们都有着重大的责任，我们相信你们一定能够亲密地团结起来，为着我们共同的社会主义建设事业、为着新疆各民族人民的幸福生活、为着伟大的祖国努力奋斗，完成祖国和人民交给你们的任务。
