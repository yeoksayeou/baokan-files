Xikang Province Holds People's Congress Meeting
Decides to Implement the Resolution on Abolishing the Establishment of Xikang Province
    The Third Session of the First People's Congress of Xikang Province focused on discussing the implementation of the resolution on abolishing Xikang Province passed by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. All representatives of various ethnic groups unanimously supported this resolution and decided that from October 1st this year, the Xikang Provincial People's Committee and its subordinate organizations will cease to exercise their functions and powers and be declared abolished; the People's Committees of the autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties and the special commissioner's offices will be under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee.
    The meeting was held in Ya'an from the 15th to the 19th. Liao Zhigao, Governor of Xikang Province, delivered a "Report on Implementing the Resolution on Abolishing Xikang Province passed by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress" on behalf of the Xikang Provincial People's Committee at the meeting. During the discussions, the representatives of various ethnic groups unanimously agreed that since the liberation of Xikang more than five years ago, it has basically completed the various tasks assigned by the state, and major achievements have been made in various social reform movements, economic recovery and construction work, and ethnic work. Now, in order to adapt to the needs of planned construction and to facilitate national administrative work, the abolition of the establishment of Xikang Province is completely correct. Many representatives also pointed out that the relationship between Xikang and Sichuan provinces has been extremely close historically and economically. In the past few years, Sichuan Province has provided a lot of assistance in the development of Xikang's construction undertakings. The merger of the two provinces will be more beneficial to the further unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of political and economic construction.
    The meeting also seriously discussed the various tasks in Xikang for the second half of this year as proposed in the report. The meeting charged the People's Committees at all levels to ensure the smooth completion of various tasks.
    The meeting also listened to and discussed the "Report on the Transmission of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress" and adopted a resolution expressing firm support for the resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy and other resolutions. During the discussions, many representatives of minority nationalities spoke about the concern and care shown for minority nationality regions by the Five-Year Plan based on their personal experiences of the gradual development of construction undertakings in minority nationality areas of Xikang in recent years.
    A total of ninety-eight representatives attended the meeting, representing the people of all ethnic groups in the province, including Han, Tibetan, Yi, Hui, Mongolian, and Lisu.

    西康省举行人民代表大会会议
    决定贯彻执行关于撤销西康省建制的决议
    西康省第一届人民代表大会第三次会议上着重讨论了贯彻执行第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议关于撤销西康省的决议。全体各族代表一致拥护这一决议，并决定从今年十月一日起，西康省人民委员会及所属机构即停止行使职权，宣布撤销；各自治州、市、县人民委员会和各专署受四川省人民委员会领导。
    会议十五日到十九日在雅安举行。西康省省长廖志高代表西康省人民委员会在会上作了“关于贯彻执行第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议关于撤销西康省决议的报告”。各族代表在讨论中一致认为：西康解放五年多来已基本上完成了国家所交给的各项任务，各项社会改革运动、经济恢复和建设工作、民族工作都取得了重大成绩，现在国家为了适应有计划建设的需要和便利国家行政工作，撤销西康省建制是完全正确的。许多代表还指出：西康、四川两省在历史上、经济上联系是极为密切的，几年来在发展西康的建设事业中四川省曾给了很多帮助，两省合并对各族人民的进一步团结和政治、经济建设的发展将更加有利。
    会议还认真讨论了报告中提出的西康各地今年下半年的各项工作。会议责成各级人民委员会应保证各项任务顺利完成。
    会议又听取和讨论了“关于第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的传达报告”，并通过决议表示坚决拥护关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议和其他各项决议。许多少数民族代表在讨论中纷纷以西康少数民族地区几年来建设事业逐步发展的切身体会，谈到五年计划对少数民族的关怀和照顾。
    出席这次会议的代表共九十八人，代表了全省汉、藏、彝、回、蒙古族、傈僳等各族人民。
