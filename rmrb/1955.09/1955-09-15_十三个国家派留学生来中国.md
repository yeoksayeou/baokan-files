    Thirteen Countries Send Students to Study in China

    In the new academic year, 348 students from thirteen countries will come to China to study. Among them, students from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Mongolia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have already arrived in Beijing. Students from Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, India, Indonesia, and Egypt will arrive in Beijing successively in October. Yugoslavia and Egypt are sending students to study in China for the first time.

    Among the students from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam who have come to China this time, more than 60 have studied Chinese language in their own countries, and they will directly enter various colleges and universities in Beijing for study. The remaining students from various countries will first study Chinese language for one year, and then transfer to appropriate schools for professional studies.

    The relevant colleges and universities have made appropriate arrangements in advance for the study and life of foreign students in China. They have formulated special teaching plans for them and assigned special teachers and students to prepare to help them in their studies in the future. The students who have arrived in China have been warmly welcomed by Beijing University, the Foreign Affairs College, and the Beijing Foreign Trade College. They sent special personnel to the airport and railway station to greet the students coming to China.

    In order to help the students become familiar with the students and the school, Chinese students and foreign students held forums and get-togethers together. Peking University also organized a group of foreign students who had already studied in China to accompany the new students to visit the Summer Palace, the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and Jingshan Park and other places of interest.

    在新学年中，有十三个国家的三百四十八名留学生将来中国学习。其中，苏联、德意志民主共和国、蒙古、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的留学生已经到达北京。罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、南斯拉夫、印度、印度尼西亚和埃及等国的留学生将在十月份陆续来北京。南斯拉夫和埃及是第一次派遣留学生来中国学习。
    这次来到中国的苏联、德意志民主共和国和越南民主共和国的留学生中，有六十多名曾在本国学习过中国语文，他们将直接进入北京各院、校学习。其余的各国留学生将先学习一年中国语文，然后转入适当的学校进行专业学习。
    各有关院校对外国留学生到中国以后的学习、生活，事先都作了适当的安排，为他们制定了专门的教学计划，指定了专门的教师和学生准备将来帮助他们学习。已经到达中国的留学生受到北京大学、外交学院和北京对外贸易学院等院、校的热烈欢迎，他们派了专人到飞机场、火车站去迎接来中国的同学。
    为了帮助留学生们熟悉同学和学校的情况，中国学生和留学生们在一起举行了座谈会和联欢会。北京大学还组织了一批已在中国学习的外国留学生陪同新来的留学生游览了颐和园、故宫、天坛和景山等名胜古迹。                  （新华社）
