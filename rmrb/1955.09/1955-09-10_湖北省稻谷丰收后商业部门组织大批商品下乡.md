As Hubei Province has had a bumper rice harvest, and new grain is entering the market in large quantities, rural primary markets are already bustling. According to a survey of primary markets in various counties of the Jingzhou Special District and Echeng County in mid-August, the sales volume of goods increased by about 30% compared to the same period in July, with some primary markets even seeing an increase of more than double.

To welcome the peak season and supply the means of production and daily necessities needed by farmers, Hubei Province's state-owned commercial departments are vigorously organizing supplies and providing a large amount of materials to rural areas. Provincial-level specialized companies are transferring goods to rural areas throughout the province. It is expected that the materials needed for the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day will be delivered to the grassroots supply points by September 20th. State-owned commercial departments in various counties are strengthening wholesale work. State-owned companies in Echeng, Xishui, Mianyang, and other counties have also sent staff to specifically assist grassroots cooperatives in preparing purchase plans. State-owned commercial departments in Mianyang, Echeng, and other counties have held small-scale commodity exhibitions for supply and marketing cooperatives and private merchants to select goods.

    湖北省稻谷丰收后商业部门组织大批商品下乡
    湖北省由于稻谷丰收，新粮大量上市，农村初级市场已经繁忙起来。据荆州专区各县和鄂城县等初级市场八月中旬的调查，货物销售额都比七月份同时期增加了百分之三十左右，有些初级市场还增加了一倍以上。
    为了迎接旺季，供应农民需要的生产资料和生活资料，湖北省国营商业部门正在大力组织货源，供应农村大批物资。省级各专业公司正向全省农村调运货物，预计中秋节和国庆节需要的物资，在九月二十日就可以运到各基层供应点。各县国营商业部门正在加强批发工作。鄂城、浠水、沔阳等县的国营公司，还派出工作人员具体帮助基层合作社编制进货计划。沔阳、鄂城等县国营商业部门举办了小型商品展览，以便供销合作社和私商选购货物。
