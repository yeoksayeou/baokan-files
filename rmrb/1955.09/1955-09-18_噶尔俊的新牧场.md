    Gargeun's New Pasture
    Tian Nan
      Gargeun Pasture in southern Xinjiang Province has abundant water and grass, and a suitable climate, making it a good place to develop animal husbandry production. The pasture area is very large, taking eight days to cross on horseback from east to west. The eastern part of the pasture, close to the local agricultural area, has the lowest terrain, a warm climate, and thinner snow cover, making it suitable for winter grazing. The central part of the pasture has higher terrain, a cooler climate, and grows fine and smooth pasture grass, making it suitable for spring and autumn grazing. The western part of the pasture has the highest terrain and coolest climate, making it a good place for summer grazing.
    On this vast and fertile pasture, live more than two thousand households of Kyrgyz people and a small number of Uyghur herders. However, before liberation, the herders lived in days of suffering for many years. More than two thousand Kyrgyz households were divided into three large tribes and seventeen small tribes. Each tribe occupied a piece of pasture. Older herders recall the situation at the time: From the time we can remember, the livestock of each tribe could not cross the boundary of other tribes, and livestock that crossed the boundary could never be recovered. In the past, this often caused disputes. The livestock of each tribe could not adapt to the climate and pasture grass, bringing great losses to animal husbandry production. In the winter of 1942, the summer pasture occupied by the Xirik tribe had more than a foot of snow, and nearly half of the livestock died.
    After liberation, the light of the Party's policy of ethnic equality and unity shone on the pasture. The awareness of the herders of all tribes has been raised, and everyone feels that the tribal occupation of pastures is not conducive to the development of production. They actively demand the rational division and unified use of pastures. Under the leadership of the local CPC District Committee and the District Office, leaders of various tribes negotiated and divided the Gargeun pasture into four seasonal pastures, and each tribe grazed livestock in a unified manner according to the different seasons. After the four seasonal pastures were divided, grazing areas for livestock such as cattle, sheep, and horses were divided on the pasture according to the different habits of various livestock and the types of pasture grass. For example, on the spring pasture, yaks and sheep are more cold-resistant and are grazed in areas with higher terrain and cooler climates, while horses and goats are less cold-resistant and are grazed in areas with lower terrain and warmer climates. In addition, because large livestock and small livestock eat different grasses, the grazing range of large livestock and small livestock are also separated.
    The rational division and unified use of the pasture has brought happiness to the herders of Gargeun. The herders of all tribes are unprecedentedly united, and people have also carried out pasture construction work. Everyone studied and divided the winter pasture into hayfields. The herders built walls around the hayfields and also built canals to irrigate the pastures with snow water from the mountains. At the same time, special personnel were assigned to take care of them, so the amount of grass increased a lot. In the past, when it snowed on the winter pasture, the livestock had no water to drink. In the winter of 1954, the herders used great efforts to dig seven new springs, solving the difficulty of water shortage. As a result, livestock have developed rapidly. Now the livestock of the three major tribes has developed to more than 100,000, an increase of more than 62,000 compared with the time of liberation.

    噶尔俊的新牧场
    天南
      新疆省南部的噶尔俊牧场，水草丰盛，气候适宜，是发展畜牧业生产的好地方。牧场的面积很大，从东到西骑马要走八天。牧场东部，接近当地农业地区，地势最低，气候暖和，积雪较薄，宜于冬季牧放牲畜。牧场中部，地势较高，气候较凉，生长着纤维细润的牧草，宜于春秋两季牧放牲畜。牧场西边，地势最高，气候最凉，是夏季牧放牲畜的好地方。
    在这片广阔肥沃的牧场上，居住着两千多户柯尔克孜族和少数的维吾尔族牧民。但解放前多少年来，牧民们都是在苦痛的日子里度过的。两千多户柯尔克孜族牧民就分成三个大部落和十七个小部落。各个部落各占有一块牧场。老年牧民回忆当时的情况说：从我们记事的时候起，各个部落的牲畜都互相不能越界，越界的牲畜就再不能要回来，过去经常为此引起纠纷。各个部落的牲畜不能适应气候、牧草牧放，给畜牧业生产带来了很大的损失。一九四二年冬天，西日克部落占有的夏季牧场上落了一尺多厚的雪，牲畜就死亡了近一半。
    解放后，党的民族平等、团结政策的光耀照耀了牧场。各部落牧民的觉悟都提高了，大家感到部落占有牧场对发展生产不利，积极要求合理划分和统一使用牧场。在当地中共区委会和区公所的领导下，各部落领袖人物进行了协商，把噶尔俊牧场划为四季牧场，各个部落按照季节的不同统一放牧牲畜。划分了四季牧场以后，又根据各种牲畜不同的习性和牧草种类，在牧场上又划分了牛、羊、马等牲畜的牧放区域。如在春季牧场上，牦牛和绵羊较耐寒，就在地势高、气候较凉的地区牧放，马和山羊抗寒力较弱，就在地势低、气候较暖的地方牧放。此外，由于大畜和小畜爱吃的草不同，还分了大畜和小畜的牧放范围。
    牧场的合理划分和统一使用，给噶尔俊的牧民带来了幸福。各部落牧民空前地团结起来了，人们还进行了牧场的建设工作。大家研究把冬季牧场划成打草场，牧民们在打草场的周围垒起了围墙，还修了水渠，利用高山雪水灌溉草场，同时指派专人看管，因此草量增加了很多。过去冬季牧场下雪，牲畜就没有水喝。一九五四年冬天，牧民们用很大力量新挖了七个泉眼。解决了缺水的困难。这样，牲畜发展得很快，现在三个大部落的牲畜已经发展到了十万多只，较解放时增加了六万二千多头。
