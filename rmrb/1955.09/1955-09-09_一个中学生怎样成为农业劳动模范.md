    How a Middle School Student Became a Model Agricultural Laborer

    Hu Zhaokun, a model agricultural producer in Shandong Province who actively studies agricultural technology and leads the entire cooperative in achieving bumper harvests year after year, has recently been selected as an activist to attend the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists.

    Hu Zhaokun, only twenty-five years old this year, is the chairman of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shenjia Village, Eleventh District, Weixian County. He was a second-year junior high school student who joined agricultural production in 1950. In the spring of 1951, the village established a mutual aid team, and everyone elected him as the team leader. During the labor process, he gradually realized that agricultural production was not as simple as he had imagined, but a profound subject. He was determined to learn it. He read various books on agricultural science and technology during his breaks. He applied what he learned to production. Initially, he helped his father summarize his tobacco growing experience. The following year, he and his father used new tobacco growing methods for experiments. By the autumn, they harvested 260 jin per mu, doubling the yield from the previous year. This successful yield-increasing method was quickly promoted within the team.

    In 1951, he actively led the team members to study and improve farming methods, changing the land from planting three crops every two years to planting four crops every two years. He also eliminated pests and diseases in a timely manner. The following year, the entire team achieved a bumper harvest, increasing grain production by more than 10,000 jin. That year, at the county labor model conference, the mutual aid team he led was rated as a first-class model team, and he himself was rated as a county labor model and received an award.

    In January 1953, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in the village, and Hu Zhaokun was elected as the chairman. At this time, the cooperative was in a chaotic state. The wheat was infected with jaundice disease during harvesting, and the increase in production was not much higher than that of farmers outside the cooperative. He was anxious and exhausted, and fell ill. Even in his illness, he was still concerned about the work of the cooperative. The Secretary of the County Party Committee, after learning about this, came to help and encourage him in person. The County Party Committee also sent a work team to provide specific assistance, enabling him to find a solution to the difficulties. He and the cooperative committee members studied and formulated various necessary systems and annual and seasonal plans for land cultivation and distribution, financial management, etc. From then on, the cooperative was on the right track.

    In that year, he led the cooperative members to select excellent varieties, adopted advanced farming methods such as seed soaking and seed dressing with chemicals, wide ridges and dense planting, and reasonable fertilization, and also eliminated pests and diseases in a timely manner. As a result, the entire cooperative increased grain production by more than 12,000 jin on the same area of land that year compared to the previous year. In that year, the rational use of labor saved the entire cooperative more than 900 workdays.

    Hu Zhaokun was concerned about the work of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative day and night. One night, he was awakened by a heavy rain. He got up, put on his clothes, and braved the heavy rain to run to the slope, digging open two mu of tobacco ridges to drain the accumulated water that would cause the tobacco to rot. During the harvest season, when the crops arrived at the threshing ground, he always went out on patrol several times every night before he felt at ease. During the Spring Festival, when the cooperative members wanted to go to the festivities, he automatically replaced the breeder to feed the pigs and collect manure, allowing them to enjoy the festival.

    Now, under the leadership of the Party, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative has expanded from 20 households to 55 households through the efforts of Hu Zhaokun and the cooperative members. Hu Zhaokun also honorably joined the Communist Party of China in April of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一个中学生怎样成为农业劳动模范
    积极学习农业技术、领导全社连年获得丰收的山东省丰产模范胡兆坤，最近被选为出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的积极分子。
    今年才二十五岁的胡兆坤是潍县十一区申家村红星农业生产合作社社长，他是初中二年级的学生，在一九五零年就参加了农业生产。一九五一年春天村里成立了互助组，大家就选他当了组长。在劳动过程中，他逐渐体会到农业生产并不是想像的那样简单，而是一门大学问，他下定决心要学会它。他就在休息时阅读各种有关农业科学技术知识的书籍。他一面学习一面把学到的东西运用到生产中去。开始，他帮助父亲总结种烟经验，第二年，他就和父亲用新的种烟方法作试验。到秋后每亩收了二百六十斤，比上年增产一倍。这个成功的增产方法很快就在组里推行了。
    一九五一年，他积极领导组员研究和改进了耕作方法，把土地每两年种三季改为两年种四季，还及时消灭了病虫害，第二年全组获得丰收，增产粮食一万多斤。这一年在县劳动模范会上，他所领导的互助组被评为一等模范组，他本人也被评为县劳动模范，得到了奖励。
    一九五三年一月，村里成立了红星农业生产合作社，胡兆坤当选为社长。这时社内乱糟糟的，小麦在收割时又染上了疸毒病，比社外农民增产不多。他又急又累，病倒了，在病中，他仍然惦念着社里的工作。中共县委书记知道这件事以后，就亲自来帮助他、鼓励他；县委还派了工作组来具体帮助他，使他找到了解决困难的办法。他和社务委员们研究订出了各种必要的制度和订出了年和季的土地耕耘分配、财务管理等计划，从此，合作社走上了轨道。
    在这一年，他领导社员们挑选优良品种，采用了浸种和药剂拌种、宽垅密植、合理施肥等先进耕作方法，还及时消除病虫害，因而这年全社在同面积的土地上又比上年增产了一万二千多斤粮食。这一年合理使用劳动力，给全社节约了九百多个劳动日。
    胡兆坤日日夜夜地关心着红星农业生产合作社的工作。在一个夜里，他被暴雨惊醒了，翻起身来披上衣服就冒着大雨跑到坡里，把二亩烟畦扒开，放掉那会使烟发生烂腰病的积水。收割季节里，庄稼到了场，他每夜总要出去巡逻几趟才放心。欢度春节的时候，社员们都要去赶热闹，他却自动地去替换饲养员喂猪、栏粪，让他们过节日。
    现在，红星农业生产合作社在党的领导下经过胡兆坤和社员们的努力，已由二十户扩大到五十五户了。胡兆坤并在今年四月光荣地参加了中国共产党。（新华社）
