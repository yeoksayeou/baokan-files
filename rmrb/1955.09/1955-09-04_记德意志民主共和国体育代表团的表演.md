A Record of the Performance of the German Democratic Republic Sports Delegation
    Cheng Zhi

The sports delegation led by Mann Ewald, Chairman of the Sports Commission of the German Democratic Republic, gave three outstanding performances in Beijing from August 28th to September 1st. The people of the capital welcomed the first group of excellent gymnasts from this brotherly country with brotherly warmth. What the sports delegation of the German Democratic Republic brought was not only their superb gymnastics skills, but more importantly, the friendship of the people of the German Democratic Republic.

The three performances of the gymnastics team of the German Democratic Republic sports delegation at the Beihai Stadium in the capital aroused great interest among the audience.

The women's balance beam, uneven bars, and free exercise performances were extremely outstanding.

The balance movements on the balance beam are composed of various gymnastics movements, acrobatics, and dance movements. It is very difficult to maintain stable balance and perform various complex and beautiful movements on a balance beam that is only ten centimeters wide. However, the seven gymnasts from the German Democratic Republic outstandingly demonstrated their mastery of this sport. Rita Förthenhauer's graceful posture was warmly welcomed. Her back walkover was performed both skillfully and gracefully. In an instant, she had performed a thrilling flip of her body flawlessly. Doing this movement well is difficult, as it requires the athlete to have not only good physical qualities, but also a bold and decisive spirit. Förthenhauer's performance demonstrated her achievements in these physical and mental qualities. Vera Ewald—a sports champion of the German Democratic Republic, the national champion in this event, and the national champion in uneven bars—her performance on the balance beam led people into another realm. Her balance movements were all relatively difficult, but the connections between the movements were extremely clear and neat, giving people a sense of strength and vigor. Michaelis is the champion of the German Democratic Republic's "Olympic Women's Gymnastics Eight Events" and also the national champion in both free exercise and vault. All her movements on the balance beam appeared very natural, harmonious, strong, and beautiful. A straddle jump with legs together for balance is a relatively difficult sudden stop movement, but Michaelis was able to master it perfectly.

The men's rings are a test of whether an athlete possesses a wide variety of qualities. Difficult strength (slow rise) movements and static poses require gymnasts to have great strength. Various flips require great flexibility and agility. And dismount movements, especially those in swinging, require a brave spirit. The male gymnasts of the German Democratic Republic demonstrated their skillful techniques in their performances, among which Lothar Heil's entire set of movements was the most successful. His support, slow rise to handstand, and front and back horizontal demonstrated both strength and agility, as well as a refined cultivation.

The women athletes’ uneven bars performances were equally pleasing. The characteristic of this event is to combine active movements with static poses, requiring both skill and grace, as well as the athlete to arrange their entire set of movements in a reasonable and orderly manner. In these aspects, the female athletes of the German Democratic Republic have reached a certain height. Lieselotte Zimmermann's swing, handstand, straddle back tuck over the high bar, and Roselore Stöber's inbar full-twisting release from the low bar to the high bar are all movements that require rigorous training to perform, but they did not appear particularly difficult when they performed them. Ewald still prominently displayed her vigorous style in her performance in this event. The movements she performed were relatively more difficult, and some of the active movements were even of a higher level on the single bar, but Ewald was able to do them correctly and beautifully with ease. Michaelis left people with the impression that she not only had a graceful physique, but also particularly sharp nerves and excellent qualities of courage and decisiveness, as she was able to clearly determine her orientation in sudden situations. For example, in the handstand turn connected to a swing around the high bar and a skin-the-cat, she still clearly performed a coherent movement in the blink of an eye.

The free exercises performed by the male and female athletes revealed the extent of their multi-faceted physical training. At the beginning, the female athlete Gertraud Böhme showed the characteristics of her event: the movements conformed to the selected music, and the transitional movements between each group of movements appeared light and natural. Zimmermann and Förthenhauer had more artistic dance beauty. Among the performers in this event, Michaelis cannot but be mentioned again. Every one of her movements was done very precisely and harmoniously, and the various parts of her body were arranged well with each other. After a series of front handsprings followed by side aerials, she quickly controlled her body and maintained a beautiful balanced posture. This is a high artistic performance of a person's ability to control their body.

The male athletes of the German Democratic Republic performed the majestic posture of health and strength. They had already displayed strong arm, leg, and waist strength in the pommel horse and rings; and in the free exercise performance, they demonstrated their agile jumping ability and shapely physique. Wolfgang Gipser, a young gymnast who is only nineteen years old, was greatly welcomed for his tumbling movements. In particular, he can perform a fish flop back handspring to a considerable height, which is a difficult movement to do well, but Gipser performed it skillfully with a spirit of bravely advancing forward. Heil and Günther Nachtigall's performances were also very successful. After a series of tumbling movements, he suddenly performed a vertical aerial with a half twist, followed by a beautiful static balance movement. This kind of bold and delicate performance, in addition to the excellent Soviet athletes who enjoy the title of world's first who have performed in our country, Nachtigall's performance is the most outstanding.

The poetic free exercise ended in a storm of applause. After the men's parallel bars performance, the beautiful women's hoop gymnastics appeared on the field again. To the melody of the piano, six female athletes wearing light green dresses lined up and walked onto the crimson velvet carpet. They wore white hoops diagonally across their shoulders. The suite of the piano suddenly turned into a rapid rhythm, and the six athletes danced gracefully to the changing rhythm. The slow, urgent, low, and high notes of the music were closely combined with the athletes' left and right turns, bows, and walks. This was simply a beautiful dance.

The last performance was the men's horizontal bar. The athletes demonstrated their brave spirit and tenacious will.

The achievements of the German Democratic Republic in gymnastics, which were displayed in our country's sports field, also illustrate the development of their sports cause. From August 1, 1948, the day the Sports Commission of the German Democratic Republic was established, a new page in the history of sports was opened. Under the care of the Socialist Unity Party, the Republic government gave great help to the people's sports cause, allocating 130 million marks in the first five-year plan alone to build new sports venues. The Higher School of Physical Culture in Leipzig absorbed many children of workers and peasants to study here, and they were cultivated into excellent future sports teachers under the best conditions. Because it established from the beginning a firm policy of learning from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic has a strong guarantee in the development of sports and the improvement of technology. The German Democratic Republic has established 19 sports associations, more than 5,000 factory sports groups, with a total of more than one million members, as well as 1,700 local sports organizations with more than 150,000 members. In recent years' international competitions, athletes from the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly created world records and national records. Among the gymnasts who have come to our country as guests, some are excellent athletes who have won awards in international competitions. The female athlete Michaelis is the daughter of a worker, and she won in the friendship competition between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Bulgaria in March this year. She took fourth place in the international gymnastics competition at the Czechoslovak Republic National Games in July. This young female athlete recently showed her talent again at the Second International Youth Friendship Games of the World Youth Festival. The athletes of the German Democratic Republic are advancing towards the road to victory with a new attitude.

    记德意志民主共和国体育代表团的表演
    程执
    由德意志民主共和国体育运动委员会主席曼·埃瓦德率领的体育代表团，从八月二十八日起到九月一日止，在北京作了三场卓越的表演。首都的人们，用兄弟般的热情欢迎了来自这个兄弟国家的第一批优秀体操选手。德意志民主共和国体育代表团带来的，不仅是他们高超的体操技术成就，更重要的是带来了德意志民主共和国人民的友谊。
    德意志民主共和国体育代表团体操代表队在首都北海体育场的三次表演，引起观众极大的兴趣。
    女子平衡木、高低杠和自由体操表演得极为出色。
    平衡木的平衡动作，是由各种不同的体操动作、机巧运动动作和舞蹈动作组成的。在仅十公分宽的平衡木上，要保持稳定的平衡，并做出种种复杂、美妙的动作，这是一件很困难的事情。但德意志民主共和国的七个体操运动员，都杰出地表现了她们对这个运动项目的素养。瑞塔·弗腾豪尔的优美姿态受到人们的热烈欢迎。她的后柔软翻表演得既纯熟，又优美。在倏忽之间，她已将她的身体分毫不爽地做了一次惊险的翻转。做好这个动作是困难的，它不但要求运动员必须具备良好的身体素质，同时也要有大胆、果断的精神。弗腾豪尔的表演显示了她在体质和品质上的这些造诣。维拉·埃瓦德——德意志民主共和国运动健将、这个项目的全国冠军和高低杠全国冠军，她在平衡木上的表演把人们引入另一境界。她的平衡动作都是比较困难的，而动作和动作间的连接却极清楚、利落，给人以刚劲、雄健的感觉。米哈埃利克是德意志民主共和国“奥林匹克女子体操八项”的冠军获得者，也是全国自由体操和跳马的两项冠军。她在平衡木上的一切动作，都显得十分自然、和谐、雄健而优美。并腿起跳、分腿平衡是比较困难骤然停止的动作，米哈埃利克却能掌握得恰到好处。
    男子吊环是对运动员是否具备多种多样品质的考验。困难的用力（慢起）动作和静止姿势，要求体操运动员要有很强的体力。各种翻转要求有很大的柔软性和灵活性。而跳下动作，特别是在摆荡中需要有勇敢的精神。德意志民主共和国的男子体操运动员们，在表演中表现了他们熟练的技艺，其中洛塔·海尔的全部动作做得最成功。他的支撑、慢起倒立、反正水平，既表现出了力量，又表现出了敏捷、圆熟的修养。
    女运动员们的高低杠表演，同样给人们以愉快的感觉。这个项目的特征是使活动的动作和静止的姿势结合起来，它既要作得圆熟、优美，又要运动员把自己的整套动作编排得合理有序。在这些方面，德意志民主共和国的女运动员们已达到一定高度。丽则劳特·齐莫曼的摆振、倒立、分腿后腾越高杠，罗则娄勒·施托伯从低杠过高杠的倒空翻抓杠回环，都是需要经过严格锻炼才能做出的动作，但她们在表演时却并不显得特别繁难。埃瓦德在这个项目的表演中仍然突出地表现了她的刚劲的风格。她所做的动作都是比较更困难的，有些活动的动作甚至在单杠上也是较高级的，埃瓦德却能从容不迫地把它做得既正确又美观。米哈埃利克在最后表演这个项目时，给人们留下这样一个印象：她不仅有优美的体态，而且还有特别敏锐的神经和勇敢、果断的优良品质，在突然形成的情况下，她能清楚地判定方位。如倒立转体连接摆振绕高杠卷身上，在间不容发的时候她仍清晰地做出连贯的动作。
    男、女运动员表演的自由体操，显露了他们多方面的身体训练程度。女运动员盖特奥德·鲍荷一开始就表现出了她的这个项目的特点：动作符合所选择的乐曲，各组动作间的过渡动作显得轻捷、自然。齐莫曼和弗腾豪尔更具艺术的舞蹈美。在这个项目的表演者中，不能不再一次提到米哈埃利克。她的任何一个动作都做得很精确、协调，身体的各部分互相都安排得很好。在连续的前空翻又接连做侧身腾空翻后，她迅速地控制住自己的身体，保持优美的平衡姿态。这是人对于控制自己躯体能力的高度艺术表演。
    德意志民主共和国的男运动员们表演了健和力的雄姿。他们在鞍马和吊环中已显示了强大的臂力、腿力和腰力；在自由体操表演时，又展示了他们灵敏的跳跃能力和健美的体态。沃尔夫冈·吉普塞尔是个年仅十九岁的青年体操家，他的空翻动作受到极大的欢迎。特别是他能腾起到相当高度的鱼跃后手翻，这是个很难做好的动作，吉普塞尔却以勇往直前的精神作了圆熟的表演。海尔和昆特尔·纳赫梯加尔的表演也很成功。他在连续的空翻后忽然来一个立体腾空翻二分之一转体，紧接着是优美的静止平衡动作。这种大胆、细腻地表演，除享有世界第一称号的优秀的苏联运动员曾在我国表演过外，纳赫梯加尔的表演要算最杰出的了。
    诗意般的自由体操在暴风雨般的掌声中结束了。男子双杠表演后，场上又出现了美妙的女子藤圈体操。随着钢琴的旋律，六个穿着浅绿色衣裙的女运动员列队走上紫红色的金丝绒地毯。她们肩上斜挂着白色的藤圈。钢琴的组曲忽然变成急促的律调，六个运动员就踏着变化的律调翩翩起舞。乐曲的缓急低昂和运动员的左旋右转、俯仰行止密切地结合着。这简直是优美的舞蹈。
    最后表演的节目是男子单杠。运动员们表现了他们的勇敢精神和顽强意志。
    在我国运动场上展示的德意志民主共和国的体操运动成就，同时说明了他们体育运动事业的发展。从一九四八年八月一日，德意志民主共和国体育运动委员会成立的那一天起，就打开了体育运动史的新页。在统一社会党的关怀下，共和国政府给予人民体育运动事业以极大的帮助，仅在第一个五年计划内，就拨出了一亿三千万马克的经费来修建新型的运动场所。设立在莱比锡的高等体育学校，吸收了许多工农子弟到这里来进修，他们在最好的条件下被培养成未来的优秀体育教师。由于一开始就确立了坚定不移地向苏联学习的方针，因此德意志民主共和国在体育运动的发展和技术的提高方面，就有了坚强的保证。德意志民主共和国已建立起十九个体育协会，五千多个工厂体育小组，共有一百多万会员，此外还有拥有十五万多会员的一千七百个地方体育组织。在近年来的国际比赛中，德意志民主共和国运动员曾多次创造世界纪录和国家纪录。在已经来到我国作客的体操运动员中，也有一些是国际比赛获奖的优秀选手。女运动员米哈埃利克是个工人的女儿，她在今年三月德意志民主共和国同保加利亚人民共和国举行的友谊比赛中获得胜利。在七月捷克斯洛伐克共和国全国运动大会的国际体操比赛中取得第四名。这个年青的女运动员，不久前在世界青年联欢节的第二届国际青年友谊运动会上再度显露了头角。德意志民主共和国的运动员们，正以新的姿态向着胜利的道路前进。
