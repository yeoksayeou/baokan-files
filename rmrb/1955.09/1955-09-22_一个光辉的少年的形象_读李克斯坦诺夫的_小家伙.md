    A Glorious Image of a Young Boy
    —Reading Likstanov's "The Little One"
    Lan Ling

    Likstanov's "The Little One" is an excellent work in Soviet children's literature. It reflects how workers in the rear during the Soviet Patriotic War engaged in sacred labor and struggle to defend freedom, the happiness of their motherland, and their future, creating a lively and glorious image of Kostya Malyshev who grew up in labor and struggle.

    The path of the little one, Malyshev, embodies the process of a child growing into an advanced worker and fighter. Before he entered the factory and came into contact with real labor life, like all children, he was fascinated by nature and had many fantasies about it. He wanted to go on expeditions to the great forests, admire the blue mist layers, find gold in the sacred lake at the bottom of the lake covered with gold, and listen to the sky-blue fish sing. In the pursuit of fantasy, this little guy had already shown his love for the motherland's nature and his tenacious spirit of not fearing difficulties. He once went to the great forest to pan for gold. Other children thought panning for gold was a waste of time and went swimming, but Kostya kept searching and finally found a natural piece of gold, the "Golden Pig's Head." From his own experience, he deeply realized that for all difficult things, one should persevere to the end, and whoever perseveres to the end, luck will belong to him.

    If the imaginative power shown in children and the strong spirit arising from it are not guided into real labor and struggle, and if it is not elevated to lofty labor enthusiasm and patriotism, then, due to his ignorance and lack of understanding of society, even if he participates in practical work, the temptation of this fantasy and the stubborn methods he takes to realize this fantasy may not immediately disappear completely, and thus may cause him to make mistakes. The decisive key lies in strong Soviet moral education and influence. After Kostya made his first mistake, he wanted to return to the great forest to pan for gold and donate it to the country. He thought that panning for gold in the great forest would contribute more to the country than working in the factory. His good friend, the Communist Youth League member Misha, corrected his unrealistic fantasy. Misha rebuked him, "This is treason, do you understand?" (page 88) "Now what we value more is another kind of gold," "This most valuable gold is our hands. Their obligation is to make guns and cannons for the front... Think for yourself, what would happen if all the workers ran away from the factory? It's no different from desertion at the front. Workers' hands, if they work honestly, are more valuable than any gold." (page 89) Misha's sincere friendship and high degree of principle influenced him, enabling him to correctly understand the significance of labor, to understand the importance of their work to the war to defend the motherland, and enabling him to move forward in the life of labor struggle. He won the glorious title of "Nail-driving Sharpshooter" and further realized his ideal of becoming a lathe operator. When he cut out the first chip, how happy and proud he was, "What else can't a person who can cut steel do! Even mountains—he will flatten them, even rivers—he will block them, even great forests—he can open wide forest paths and build cities in them, now that the Germans are waging war on his land—he will burn the fascists to death, annihilate the fascists, because he is the master of metal, the master of manufacturing ‘Katyusha’s’!" (page 145) Real labor and struggle unfolded the entire vast world before Kostya's eyes, "Thus, the world became kind and lovely." (ibid.)

    However, despite this, he still did not completely get rid of the temptation of fantasy. When he damaged the lathe again under the deception of Seva and Kolka and received more severe criticism from the masses, he did not understand that this mistake "delayed our repelling the enemy's offensive at the front. It is also possible that someone died at the front because of this" (page 185), but only felt that his self-esteem had been humiliated, so he wanted to escape to the great forest again. This idea of his was severely taught by the Party group leader Sergei, "Conscience will catch you!" "You have to believe it! You will never forget for the rest of your life how you supported the soldiers at the front in difficult years..." "You must know that the enemy is trying to take advantage of every mistake we make. That's why we shouldn't make mistakes." (pages 186-187) The Party's strict education and enthusiastic care for Malyshev was the decisive force that enabled him to completely get rid of the interference of childish fantasies and firmly set his feet in the reality of labor and struggle.

    Malyshev, who became a completely conscious person under the education and influence of the Party and the masses, exerted infinite labor enthusiasm and creativity in his work. He overcame one difficulty after another, climbed from one peak of life to an even higher peak, and his life became more and more brilliant. Malyshev went from being the "weakest link" in the youth workshop to the strongest link, from an auxiliary worker to an advanced worker who could independently manage one lathe and even two or three lathes. But what makes us surprised and excited is not his technical proficiency and the increase in production figures, but the rapid development of his new spiritual qualities. He linked his every move with the sacred Patriotic War. When he received the news of his brother Mitri's sacrifice, "his eyes were filled with a burning, invisible flame. He stared, stared at the darkness, he seemed to see a black, fierce, and hateful person standing there—making his heart hate as heavy as lead. He knew who this was! This is the fascist who crushed Seva's house with a tank, this is the fascist who caused many comrades of Kostya in the youth workshop to lose their parents, this is the fascist who killed Mitri, this is the fascist who brought countless disasters to the rich and happy land." (page 212) Love turned into hatred, hatred turned into strength. This is the spiritual power of will radiating from Malyshev's heart, stronger than the explosive power of "Katyusha".

    He turned the four disunited little guys into the first field work team of one mind. Malyshev helped and cared for the comrades in their team with the same love and enthusiasm that Sergei and Misha treated him. When Katya was ill, he sold his beloved "Golden Pig's Head" to buy Katya a lot of nutritious food, which brought Katya's health back, brought back active life, and therefore also brought the honor of the field work team. He enthusiastically helped "Carefree Bulkin" (Seva's nickname) to throw himself from the dream of an expedition to the great forest into the reality of labor and struggle, so that he also turned from the "weakest link" into a conscious worker and fighter. He personally experienced that in the most stressful years, it is most painful to be an untrusted "weakest link," that is, it is a shame to lack the glory of fighting labor in one's life. At this time, Malyshev, under the reality of training and hammering, had childish fantasies fly out of him like iron filings, leaving only completely refined steel.

    Malyshev's growth process is also the process of his understanding reality. Not only himself, but also "Carefree Bulkin" and Kolka. The path they took is the same. When the author shaped these images, he tightly grasped the characteristics of their "transformation" process (more accurately, grasped the characteristics of the development process of their characters), that is, the process of a child growing up and abandoning childish fantasies. The shortcomings they overcame were childish fantasies, out of sync with real life, and what they gained was more practical education and knowledge. This process is also the process of understanding reality. The accurate grasp and description of this life law and characteristic determines the authenticity of "The Little One," and therefore the image of the child created by the author is truly lively and lovely. It is not like some so-called works that write about the "transformation" of children, which only let the characters make a "transformation" according to empty principles and concepts, and a character is only a puppet of a concept, as for personality and character, it cannot be seen. Therefore, no matter how the characters "turn" over and "change" past, they are only the concept itself, not the embodiment of the laws of life, not the embodiment of the inevitable development of the character's personality. Such works lacking or even lacking authenticity cannot infect and educate children. Because, "Children's literature must have lessons, but this lesson should be integrated with the work itself, connected with the flesh and blood of its characters, and should be expressed in appropriate words, and should not float on the surface, like the soup cooked by a clumsy or lazy housewife, with drops of oil floating on it." ("Literature of the Soviet People" page 210) This means that only truth, only truthfully depicting the beautiful things that can be produced in children, can this image radiate true brilliance, and further achieve the purpose of infecting and educating readers. The reason why Likstanov was able to create such a lively and glorious image of a child like Malyshev is precisely because he truthfully wrote the character's growth process. Through the image of Malyshev and his growth process, the author skillfully instills a powerful ideological and moral torrent naturally into the hearts of readers, into the hearts of children. This point is very worthy of our study.

    一个光辉的少年的形象
    ——读李克斯坦诺夫的“小家伙”
    蓝翎
    李克斯坦诺夫的“小家伙”是苏联少年儿童文学中的一部优秀作品。它反映了在苏联卫国战争期间，大后方的工人如何为了保卫自由，保卫祖国的幸福，保卫自己的将来而进行的神圣的劳动和斗争，创造出了在劳动和斗争中成长起来的一个活泼光辉的形象柯斯嘉·马雷歇夫。
    小家伙马雷歇夫的道路体现了一个孩子成长为先进的劳动者和斗争者所经历的过程。在他还没有进入工厂同现实的劳动生活接触以前，像所有的孩子一样，他迷恋于大自然，对大自然有着很多幻想。他想去远征大森林，欣赏蓝色的雾层，到湖底铺满金子的神圣湖里去找金子，听天蓝色的鱼唱歌。在对于幻想的追求中，这个小家伙已经显示出了他对于祖国大自然的热爱和顽强的不怕困难的精神。他曾经到大森林去淘金，别的孩子们认为淘金是白白浪费时间，都跑去游泳了，但是柯斯嘉却不断地搜寻，终于找到了一块天然的金子“金猪头”。他从自己的经验中深深体会到，凡是困难的事情，都应该坚持到底，谁坚持到底，幸运就属于谁。
    如果不把在孩子们身上所表现出的这种幻想力以及由此产生的坚强精神引导到现实的劳动和斗争中来，不把它提升到崇高的劳动热情和爱国主义上面来，那末，由于他对社会的无知和缺乏理解，即使参加到实际的工作中来，这种幻想对他的诱惑力和他为了实现这种幻想所采取的固执的作法也不可能马上完全消失，因而也可能使他产生错误。决定性的关键在于强有力的苏联道德教育和影响。柯斯嘉第一次犯了错误之后，他就想回到大森林去淘金，向国家捐献。他以为到大森林里去淘金，会比在工厂里劳动给国家作出更多的贡献。他的好朋友共青团员米沙纠正了他的这种不切实际的幻想，米沙责备他说，“这是叛国行为，你明白吗？”（八八页）“现在我们更宝贵的是另一种金子”，“这最宝贵的金子，就是我们的手。它们的义务是给前线造枪炮……你自己想吧，如果工人都从工厂跑掉，那会怎么样。这跟在前线开小差没有两样。工人的手，如果它们是老老实实干活，那就比什么黄金都宝贵。”（八九页）米沙的真诚的友谊和高度的原则性影响了他，使他正确地认识了劳动的意义，认识了他们的工作对于保卫祖国的战争的重要性，使他在劳动斗争的生活中向前突进了。他获得了“敲钉神枪手”的光荣称号，又进一步实现了当车工的理想。当他车出了第一道切屑时，他的心情是多么高兴而骄傲啊，“会切削钢铁的人还有什么事情不会做呢！就是山吧——他会把它们铲平，河吧——他会把它们堵住，大森林吧——他能够在它里面开辟宽阔的林间道路和建筑起城市来，现在德国人在他的国土上进行战争——他就会烧死法西斯，歼灭法西斯，因为他是金属的主人翁，是制造‘喀秋沙’的能手！”（一四五页）现实的劳动和斗争，使整个广大的世界展开在柯斯嘉的眼前，“这样，世界就变得亲切、可爱了。”（同上）
    但是，尽管这样，他仍然没有彻底摆脱幻想的诱惑力。当他再次在谢伐和柯尔卡的欺骗下搞坏了车床而受到群众更严厉的批评时，他并不了解这错误“耽误了我们在前线击退敌人的进攻。也可能，有人因此在前线阵亡了”（一八五页），只是感到自尊心受到了屈辱，因此又想逃到大森林里去。他这种想法受到了党组长谢尔盖依严厉的教训，“良心会把你抓住！”“你要相信呀！你将一辈子忘不掉，在艰苦的年头里你是怎么样支援前方战士的……”“要知道，敌人正竭力想利用我们每一个人的错误。这就是我们为什么不该犯错误的原因。”（一八六—一八七页）党对马雷歇夫的严格教育和热情的关怀，是使他彻底地摆脱幼稚的幻想的干扰而牢牢地把脚步踏到现实的劳动和斗争中来的决定力量。
    在党和群众的教育影响下成了完全自觉的人以后的马雷歇夫，在工作中发挥了无限的劳动热情和创造力。他克服了一个困难又克服了一个困难，从生活的一个顶峰又爬上一个更高的顶峰，他的生活一页比一页更光辉灿烂。马雷歇夫由青工车间“最弱的一环”变成了最强的一环，由辅助工变成可以独立管理一部车床直至两部三部车床的先进工人。但令我们感到惊喜和激动的还不是他的技术的熟练和生产数字的增长，而是他的新的精神品质的飞速发展。他把自己的一举一动都同神圣的卫国战争联系在一起。当他得到哥哥米特黎依牺牲的消息时，“他的眼睛充满了火烧一般的、看不见的火焰。他凝视着，凝视着黑暗，他仿佛看见那边站着一个黑色的、凶恶的而且令人痛恨的人——使他的心痛恨得像铅一样沉重。他知道这是谁！这就是那个用坦克压毁谢伐房子的法西斯，这就是那个使青工车间里柯斯嘉的许多同志丧失了父母的法西斯，这就是打死米特黎依的法西斯，这就是给富饶和幸福的国土带来了无数灾难的法西斯。”（二一二页）热爱化成仇恨，仇恨化成力量。这是从马雷歇夫的心灵中射出的比“喀秋沙”的爆炸力更强烈的意志的精神的力量。
    他使不团结的四个小家伙变成一条心的第一个战地工作队。马雷歇夫以谢尔盖依和米沙对待他那样的同志的爱和热情去帮助去关心他们队里的同志。卡嘉生病的时候，他卖掉了自己心爱的“金猪头”给卡嘉买来很多的营养品，换来了卡嘉的健康，换来了活跃的生活，因此也有了战地工作队的荣誉。他热情地帮助“吊儿浪荡布尔金”（谢伐的绰号）从远征大森林的迷梦中投到现实的劳动和斗争中来，使他也从“最弱的一环”变成了自觉的劳动者和战斗者。他亲身体验到，在最紧张的年代里，做一个不被人信任的“最弱的一环”是最痛苦的，也就是说在自己的生活中缺乏战斗的劳动的光彩是一种耻辱。这时的马雷歇夫，已经在现实的锻炼和锤击之下，使幼稚的幻想像铁屑一样从他的身上飞迸出去，剩下的是完全精粹的钢。
    马雷歇夫的成长过程，也就是他认识现实的过程。不仅他自己这样，“吊儿浪荡布尔金”和柯耳卡也是这样。他们所走的道路是一样的。作者在塑造这些形象的时候，紧紧地把握住了他们“转变”过程的特征（更准确一点说是抓住了他们性格发展过程的特征），也就是一个孩子成长时丢掉幼稚幻想的过程。他们所克服的缺点，是幼稚的幻想，同实际生活的不合拍，他们所获得的是更切合实际的教育和知识。这个过程也就是认识现实的过程。这个生活规律性和特征的准确把握和描写，决定了“小家伙”的真实性，因而作者所创造的孩子的形象才是真正活泼可爱的。它并不像有些所谓写儿童“转变”的作品那样，只是按照空洞的原则和概念让人物来一个“转变”，一个人物只是一种概念的傀儡，至于个性、性格是看不到的。因此，无论人物怎样地“转”过来和“变”过去，都只是概念的本身，而不是生活规律的体现，不是人物性格的必然发展的体现。这样缺少甚至没有真实性的作品也就不可能感染、教育儿童。因为，“儿童文学一定要有教训，可是这教训应该和作品本身水乳交融，和它的人物形象血肉相连，应该用合适的辞汇来表现，而不要浮在上面，就像拙劣或者偷懒的主妇所煮的汤，上面漂着一滴一滴的油那样。”（“苏联人民的文学”二一○页）这也就是说，只有真实，只有真实地描写出孩子们身上所能够产生的美好的东西，这形象才能放射出真正的光辉，并进而达到感染教育读者的目的。李克斯坦诺夫所以能创造出马雷歇夫这样一个活泼光辉的孩子的形象，正是因为他真实地写出了人物的成长过程。作者通过马雷歇夫的形象和他的成长过程，巧妙地把一股强大的思想的道德的洪流，自然而然地灌输到读者，灌输到孩子们的心田中去。这一点是非常值得我们学习的。
