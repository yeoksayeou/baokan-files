Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: According to TASS news, several heads of delegations attending the 44th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference spoke to reporters about the work of the current session.

    The head of the Danish parliamentary delegation, Alsing Andersen, when discussing the significance of the meeting, pointed out that the primary benefit was establishing contact with representatives from other countries, including those from the Soviet Union and various people's democracies, in Helsinki. He said that the conference provided opportunities for better understanding between all parties.

    In response to the question of allowing the People's Republic of China to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Andersen said that this issue would be left to the Executive Committee meeting in Delhi during the last week of November for final discussion. It is currently impossible to say what the decision will be at that time. However, it is clear that there is no question of recognizing the Taiwan parliament as the representative of the Chinese people, and it is impossible for a country to have more than one representative. He said, "It is no secret that all Scandinavian countries advocate for the Beijing parliament to be granted the right to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union."

    The head of the British delegation, Scott, said that the Helsinki conference was, on the whole, very successful. Relations between countries are closer than before, and some major issues that were dividing the world not long ago now seem easier to resolve.

    When discussing China's membership in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, he said that China would undoubtedly be invited to participate soon.

    The head of the Belgian delegation, Senator Rolin, emphasized that much was discussed at the meeting regarding the benefits of resolving disputes through peaceful means, and the conference as a whole focused on the issue of peaceful coexistence.

    He said he was disappointed by the opposition of certain groups to China's membership because the Union's charter requires recognition of representatives from the parliament of the People's Republic of China.

    丹、英、比等国出席各国议会联盟大会的代表团团长
    谈联盟本届会议意义和我国参加联盟问题
    新华社三日讯　据塔斯社消息：参加各国议会联盟第四十四届大会的一些国家的代表团团长就本届大会的工作向报纸记者发表了谈话。
    丹麦议会代表团团长阿尔辛·安德生在谈到会议的意义时指出，首先是在赫尔辛基同其他国家代表、包括同苏联以及各人民民主国家代表建立了接触。他说，大会使得彼此有机会更加了解。
    安德生在回答关于允许中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的问题时说，这个问题要留待十一月最后一周在德里举行的执行委员会会议来讨论。那时将作出怎样的决定，现在还无法讲。但是，很明显的是，根本谈不到承认台湾的议会为中国人民的代表，而一个国家有一个以上的代表也是不可能的。他说：“所有斯堪的纳维亚国家都主张北京的议会获得参加各国议会联盟的权利，这已经不是秘密了。”
    英国代表团团长斯科特说，赫尔辛基大会总的来说非常成功。各国的关系比以前更加密切了，不久以前分裂着世界的一些大问题现在似乎比较容易解决了。
    在谈到中国在各国议会联盟里的会员资格问题时，他说，无疑地中国不久将被邀请参加。
    比利时代表团团长、上议院议员罗林强调指出，会上对以和平的方法来解决争执的问题的好处谈了很多，这次会议总的来说是集中于和平共处的问题。
    他说他对某些集团反对中国入会感到失望，因为联盟会章要求承认中华人民共和国议会代表。
