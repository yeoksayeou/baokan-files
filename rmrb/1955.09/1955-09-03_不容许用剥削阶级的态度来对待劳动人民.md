    Exploitative Attitudes Towards the Working People Must Not Be Tolerated
    To the Editor:
    Whenever the团员 (League members) of the Zhejiang Provincial Monopoly Corporation mention 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui), the deputy secretary of the corporation's团支部 (Youth League branch), they say, "How can someone who treats the working people with such an exploitative attitude be responsible for cultivating the communist morality of young people?"
    于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) is a共产党员 (Communist Party member). She had a child in April of last year, and by June of this year, just over a year later, she had already changed thirteen nannies. These nannies were all forced to leave because they couldn't bear her abuse.
    Just a few examples are enough to show how 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) treats her nannies:
    Last summer, every time 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) breastfed her child, she would order 王春花 (Wang Chunhua), her nanny at the time, to fan her. If the fanning was too light, she felt it wasn't cool enough; if it was too strong, she would curse, "Damn it, the fan is going into my mouth." Even when 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) was sound asleep at night, the nanny still had to fan the child and chase away mosquitoes in the late hours.... Later, 王春花 (Wang Chunhua) developed a small sore on her face. 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) not only didn't give her any treatment, but also used the excuse that "it might be contagious" to drive her away. In the winter, 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) demanded that the nanny wash her face with cold water every morning. When the nanny said she wasn't used to it, 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui)'s face darkened and she said, "If you want to wash your face with hot water, go buy it yourself. I don't have money to buy hot water for you." 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) also had this rule: the nanny had to wash the clothes that she and her sister changed out of immediately. One Sunday, there were too many clothes to wash, and it was almost ten o'clock and the nanny hadn't finished washing. The nanny suggested waiting until after breakfast to finish. At this time, 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) had just gotten out of bed and was very unhappy. She said, "I have a child to breastfeed, and I'm not even hungry yet. Why would you be hungry?..." She insisted that the nanny finish washing before eating.
    Even more seriously, 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) also deducted wages from the nannies she forced to leave. As a result, one nanny went to the small vegetable market and told others, "There's a female Party member in the Provincial Monopoly Corporation who exploits the labor of poor people. She doesn't pay for the work she assigns." Some time ago, a nanny was forced to leave after working for thirteen days, and 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) didn't pay her the full wage. The nanny repeatedly demanded it, but 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) consistently refused. As a result, the two quarreled, and the argument escalated to the point where the company's leaders became involved. The leaders talked to her, but she retorted that the nanny was slandering her. In the end, the nanny found someone to testify, and she was speechless. She threw the money on the ground, cursed loudly, and shamelessly demanded that the nanny "rehabilitate her reputation."
    于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui)'s mistreatment of nannies has aroused public indignation. Therefore, the people's supervisory correspondents reported these matters to the leadership. 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) was very dissatisfied after learning about this. She found him and questioned him, saying, "I introduced you to the Party. Why didn't you raise your opinions directly to me but instead reported them to the leadership?..." 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) often said to those who raised opinions to her: "I am a Party member, and I have been a revolutionary for many years. Don't I know the principles? Do only you know them?..." Is this the capital she uses to mistreat nannies and refuse to accept other people's opinions?
    We want to solemnly tell 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) that her deplorable attitude of treating the working people with exploitative class ideology is incompatible with the glorious title of revolutionary worker and Communist Party member. We demand that the company's Party organization give 于莲惠 (Yu Lianhui) appropriate punishment.

### 不容许用剥削阶级的态度来对待劳动人民

    不容许用剥削阶级的态度来对待劳动人民编辑同志：
    一提起浙江省专卖事业公司团支部副书记于莲惠，这个公司的团员就会说：“像这样用剥削阶级态度对待劳动人民的人，怎么能负责培养青年的共产主义道德品质呢？”
    于莲惠是一个共产党员，她在去年四月生了一个孩子，到今年六月，仅仅一年多一点，已经换了十三个保姆。这些保姆都是受不了她的虐待而被逼走的。
    只要举出以下几件事情，就可看出于莲惠究竟是怎样对待保姆的了：
    去年夏天，于莲惠每次给小孩喂奶，就叫她当时的保姆王春花打扇，轻了她觉得不够凉快，重了她又谩骂“他妈的，风扇到嘴里去了”。晚上于莲惠已入梦乡，而保姆在深夜光景还必须替小孩打扇，赶蚊子……。后来王春花脸上生了一个小疮，于莲惠不但没有给她治疗，反而借口“要传染”将她赶走了。在冬季，于莲惠却要保姆每天早晨洗冷水脸。保姆提出不习惯，于莲惠脸一沉说：“你要热水洗脸，自己去买，我可没有钱给你买热水。”于莲惠还有这样一个规定：她同她妹妹换下来的衣服，保姆必须当时就洗好。有一个星期天，换下的衣服太多了，到十时左右还洗不完，保姆提出等吃完早饭再洗。这时于莲惠刚起床，就很不满意地说：“我有小孩吃奶，肚子还没饿，你为什么会饿呢？……”非得让保姆洗完再吃饭不可。
    更严重的是，于莲惠对逼走的保姆还克扣工资，因此有个保姆就到小菜场去跟旁人说：“省专卖公司里有个女党员，剥削穷人劳动，给她做工作不给钱。”前些日子一个保姆做了十三天的工作就被逼走了，于莲惠没有给足工资。保姆再三索讨，于莲惠始终不给。因此两人吵了起来，一直闹到公司领导同志面前，领导同志找她谈话，她反说保姆诬赖她。最后保姆找人来对证，她才无话可说，把钱往地下一丢，破口大骂，还不知羞耻地要保姆“把影响给挽回过来”。
    于莲惠虐待保姆引起了大家的义愤，因此人民监察通讯员把这些事情向领导方面反映了。于莲惠知道后大为不满，把他找来质问说：“你入党是我介绍的，为什么对我有意见不直接提出来却向领导上反映？……”于莲惠还常常向对她提意见的人说：“我是个党员，革命多年，难道道理我不知道，就是你们晓得？……。”难道这就是她虐待保姆和不接受别人意见的资本吗？
    我们要正告于莲惠，用剥削阶级思想对待劳动人民的恶劣态度是同革命工作人员和共产党员的光荣称号不相容的。我们要求公司党组织给于莲惠以适当的处分。
