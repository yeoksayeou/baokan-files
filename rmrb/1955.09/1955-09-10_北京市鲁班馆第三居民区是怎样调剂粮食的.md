Making a Good Job of Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities

How the Third Residential District of Luban Hall in Beijing Adjusts Grain Supply
	Cai Jianyuan

	The third residential district of Luban Hall in Chongwen District, Beijing, began to pilot the grain rationing method in August. One of the problems to be solved during the pilot was the mutual adjustment between households with surplus and households with insufficient grain.

	After August 20th, Yu Yueqin, the resident group leader of No. 5 Houchi Xikou, clearly saw that the per capita grain rationing was sufficient for most households, with some even having a surplus, while others might be slightly short. The "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" stipulates that residents can adjust among themselves. The residents' committee meetings also always said that everyone should do this well. So she thought of using this method to solve the problem of surplus and shortage within the group. She calculated that she and her husband could buy a total of 73 jin of grain a month, which was more than the amount supplied according to the household verification in July. She couldn't eat that much herself, so she could spare seven or eight jin. She also thought: the resident group is our "mutual aid group," and we should especially promote the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship. As the group leader, she had to find a way to ensure that those in the group who lacked grain could get it within the group, and strive to have a surplus to adjust to other groups.

	Yu Yueqin carefully calculated the accounts for each household in her small courtyard. There were six households in this small courtyard. The Wang Guilan family in the north room had eight people, buying 164 jin of grain, which was eight jin more than the amount supplied according to the household verification in July. It was enough to eat, and if they were more careful, they could have a surplus. The Zhang Shufang family in the south room, with her, a ten-year-old child, and a child under three eating at home, had a total of 64 jin of grain, which was also enough.

	"The only one I'm worried about is the Li Huizhen family in the west room being a little short," Yu Yueqin helped the Li Huizhen family calculate the accounts: Li Huizhen's eldest daughter who works at a match factory and the second daughter who works at a textile factory don't eat at home. Her husband is a chemical factory worker, with a ration of 36 jin; she and her fourteen-year-old third daughter, and eleven-year-old son all get 28 jin; the eight-year-old son gets 21 jin; the five-year-old fourth daughter gets 14 jin; and the youngest son under three gets 8 jin. The seven people have a total of 163 jin. Her husband only eats at home on holidays, taking away 31 jin of grain coupons, leaving 132 jin. Compared to the family's actual grain consumption in July, this number is a little short. Calculating meal by meal until August 31st, they are still short nine jin.

	Yu Yueqin also helped the Hu Kuiyu family in the east room calculate the accounts: only the old couple live there, and there shouldn't be any waste. Although the old man is already sixty years old, he is strong and has a big appetite. The two people's supply ration totals 56 jin, which is also a little short.

	Then there is the Zhang Baoqin family, a handicraft household processing glass silver plating in the south room, a couple plus an apprentice, with a total supply ration of 92 jin for the three people. The apprentice left Beijing on August 18th to return to his hometown, and he didn't need to take any grain coupons with him, so there was a surplus of eighteen or nineteen jin. Yu Yueqin thought: This is a temporary surplus, but it can be temporarily adjusted.

	Yu Yueqin gave four jin of her extra grain to the Li Huizhen family and four jin to the Hu Kuiyu family. The Zhang Baoqin family voluntarily handed over the surplus to the resident group for unified handling. The Hu Kuiyu family already had no problem. The Li Huizhen family was then adjusted another five jin by the resident group.

	Yu Yueqin's group has a total of 45 households. During the adjustment process, households with a surplus, based on the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, adjusted out their surplus grain. Households that felt slightly short of grain, after carefully calculating the accounts with the help of Yu Yueqin and other neighbors, also determined the amount that needed to be adjusted. After the adjustment, this group still had a surplus.

	Zhu Changfa, who lives at No. 16 Houchi West Street, is already sixty-one years old, and the neighbors call him Uncle Zhu. Usually, he likes to use the saying "A thousand days of soldiers, a thousand days of rice" to tell his neighbors that grain doesn't come easily. When he sees rice grains spilled in someone's swill bucket, he reminds them to pay attention; when he sees a child throwing away leftover steamed buns or corn buns in the yard, he picks them up and sends them back to their home. He often says: "A grain of rice goes through so many procedures, and it's a pity to waste it when it's at your mouth!" He is the resident group leader. After returning home from a residents' committee meeting on grain adjustment that night, he made up his mind: he must do a good job in the group's grain adjustment work.

	The small courtyard where Zhu Changfa lives also has six households. Zhu Changfa himself, with the three old and young eating at home, can save four jin, which can be adjusted to the Song Shuzhen family in the west room. He also thought that as long as they pay attention to saving, the Song Shuzhen family will also have enough to eat. He told her: "You can't always count on adjustment." Song Shuzhen replied: "As long as we plan well, we will also have enough to eat." By the end of August, Song Shuzhen and her husband carefully calculated and believed that they would have enough to eat in September without adjustment. The Li Guitian family, an oil painter in the north room, has three people, with a ration of 85 jin of grain. He only bought the 80 jin he needed, leaving five jin unpurchased, which he adjusted to the Wang Qingxiang family next door. In the He Jingchi family in the east room, her husband doesn't eat at home, only she and two children, one five years old and one under one year old. The supply ration for the three people totals 50 jin, and if there is no waste, there will only be more, not less. There is also the single-person household Wang Qingming, who himself said: "If I save a little, it will be enough to eat."

	Zhu Changfa's group has a total of 35 households. The result of the adjustment is this: there are four households with a surplus, besides his family and the Li Guitian family, there are also the Wang family at No. 6 Houchi West Street and the Zhang family at No. 8; a total of four households, including his own courtyard, are insufficient. After mutual adjustment, this group still has a surplus.

	All sixteen residential groups in the third residential district carried out grain adjustments in this way.

	After the grain adjustment, the Li Xiuling group had two households with a surplus and one household with an insufficient amount. After mutual adjustment, there was still a surplus. The one household with an insufficient amount was the Liu Kaixiang family, because relatives came and stayed for more than ten days, short ten jin. Li Xiuling explained to Liu Kaixiang that this should be considered a temporary adjustment; if his relatives didn't come, or if his relatives' place of residence also implemented grain rationing measures, his problem wouldn't exist.

	The Qiang Dejie family at No. 11 Houchi West Street in the Liu Huizhi group had six or seven jin more, which they automatically adjusted to the Dong family in the same courtyard. Then there was the Tang family in the north room of the same courtyard who were a little short, and "couldn't find an adjustment object." The residents' committee adjusted the surplus from another group to the Tang family.

	The third residents' committee calculated the total account of the adjustment: the total adjustment in and out offset each other, leaving a surplus of 186 jin. When they learned that the fourth and fifth residential districts were still in the process of adjustment, they expressed that if the fourth and fifth residential districts needed it, they were willing to adjust the surplus grain to these two residential districts. The members of the residents' committee said: This method of mutual adjustment is really good, it not only guarantees the smooth implementation of grain rationing measures, but also promotes the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship among residents.

    北京市鲁班馆第三居民区是怎样调剂粮食的
    蔡鉴远
    北京崇文区鲁班馆第三居民区，从八月份开始试行粮食定量供应办法。试行中需要解决的问题之一，是居民中有余户和不足户的相互调剂。
    八月二十日以后，住在后池西口五号的居民小组长于月琴，已经清楚地看到，按人定量供应粮食，多数户都够吃，有的人还有节余，有的人可能缺一点。“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”上规定，居民可以相互调剂。居民委员会开会，也总说要大家把这件事办好。于是她就想用这办法来解决组内的有余和不足问题。她盘算自己和丈夫合计一个月能买到七十三斤粮食，比七月份按户核实供应的数量多，自己吃不了，可以匀出七、八斤来。她又想：居民小组就是咱的“互助组”，应该特别发扬互助友爱精神。自己是小组长，要想办法让本组缺粮食的能在本组内得到调剂，并争取有剩余调剂给别的组。
    于月琴对自己住的小杂院挨户算了细账。这个小杂院共有六户。北屋王桂兰家八口人，买粮一百六十四斤，比七月份按户核实供应的数量多八斤，足够吃了，要是再精打细算，可以有节余。南屋张淑芳家，在家吃饭的是她和一个十岁的孩子、一个不到三岁的孩子，合计六十四斤粮食，也够吃了。
    “就怕西屋李慧珍家缺一点。”于月琴帮着李慧珍家算了细账：李慧珍的在火柴工厂做工的大女儿和在纺织工厂做工的二女儿都不在家吃饭。她丈夫是化学工厂工人，供应定量是三十六斤；她和十四岁的三女儿、十一岁的儿子，都是二十八斤；八岁的儿子二十一斤；五岁的四女儿十四斤；不到三岁的小儿子八斤。七口人合计一百六十三斤，她丈夫只休假日在家吃饭，带走三十一斤粮票，还剩一百三十二斤，这个数字同她家七月份实际用粮数比，是差一点。一顿一顿算到八月三十一，还缺九斤。
    于月琴又帮着东屋胡奎玉家算了细账：只她老两口过日子，不会有什么浪费。老头虽然已经六十岁了，可是身体壮实，饭量大。两人的供应定量合计五十六斤，也差一点。
    再就是南屋加工玻璃镀水银的手工业户张宝琴家，夫妻俩，加上一个徒工，三口人的供应定量合计九十二斤。徒工从八月十八日起离开北京回老家去，还不用带粮票走，所以剩余十八、九斤。于月琴想：这是临时性的剩余，但也可以暂时调剂一下。
    于月琴把自己多余的粮食给了李慧珍家四斤，给了胡奎玉家四斤。张宝琴家自愿把多余的交居民小组统一处理。胡奎玉家已经没问题。李慧珍家，再由居民小组调剂给五斤。
    于月琴的小组，共四十五户。在进行调剂中，有剩余的户，都本着互助友爱的精神调剂出了他们剩余的粮食。粮食稍感不足的户，在于月琴和其他邻居的帮助下算过细账，也都确定了需要调剂给的数目。调剂以后，这个小组还有剩余。
    住在后池西街十六号的朱长发已经六十一岁，邻居们叫他朱大爷。平日，他爱用“千日兵千日米”这句话给邻居们讲粮食的得来不容易。他看见谁家泔水桶里撒了米粒，他就提醒谁家注意；他看见谁家孩子把吃剩的馒头或窝窝头扔在院里，他就拾起来送回谁家去。他常说：“一粒米经过多少道手续，到了口边再要糟蹋，多可惜呵！”他是居民小组长。这次居民委员会开过关于粮食调剂的会回家那天晚上，他就打定主意：一定要把小组的粮食调剂工作做好。
    朱长发住的这个小杂院也是六户。朱长发自己家里吃饭的老小三口，可以节余四斤，调剂给西屋宋淑贞家。他又想，只要注意节约，宋淑贞家也是够吃的，他告诉她：“可不能老指望调剂。”宋淑贞回答：“只要计划好，咱也会够吃。”到八月底，宋淑贞和她丈夫细算的结果，认为九月份他们可以不要调剂就够吃了。北屋油画工李贵田家三口人，定量供应八十五斤粮食，他只买了所需要的八十斤，还剩下五斤没买，就调剂给了隔壁王庆祥家。东屋何静池家，她丈夫不在家吃饭，只她和两个孩子，一个五岁，一个不到周岁。三口人的供应定量合计五十斤，如果不浪费，只会多不会少。还有单人户王庆明，他自己说：“节省点，够吃了。”
    朱长发这个小组，共三十五户。调剂的结果是这样：有剩余的四户，除了他家和李贵田家以外，还有后池西街六号王家和八号张家；不足的连他本院共四户。相互调剂以后，这个组还有剩余。
    第三居民区的十六个居民小组都是这样进行粮食调剂的。
    在调剂粮食以后，李秀玲小组有剩余的两户，不足的一户，相互调剂以后还有剩余。不足的一户是刘开祥家，因为亲戚来往了十多天，缺十斤。李秀玲对刘开祥说明，这应该算临时性的调剂；如果他亲戚不来，或他亲戚住的地方也实行了粮食定量供应办法，他这问题就不存在。
    刘慧芝小组后池西街十一号强德杰家多六、七斤，自动调剂给了同院董家。再就是这同院北屋唐家缺一点，“找不到调剂的对象”。居民委员会把别组剩余的，调剂给了唐家。
    第三居民委员会算了调剂的总账：调出和调入的两抵，还剩余一百八十六斤。当知道第四、五居民区还正在进行调剂时，他们就表示如果第四、五居民区需要，他们愿意把剩余的粮食调剂给这两个居民区。居民委员会的委员们说：这样相互调剂的办法真好，既保证了粮食定量供应办法的顺利实现，又发扬了居民间的互助友爱精神。
