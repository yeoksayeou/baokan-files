    On the Philosophical Teaching Experience of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Marxist-Leninist College
    — A Letter from Comrade Glezerman
    Editor's Note: Here we publish a letter from Comrade Glezerman, Director of the Philosophy Teaching and Research Office of the Academy of Social Sciences directly under the Central Committee of the CPSU, to Comrade Yang Xianzhen, President of the Advanced Party School directly under the Central Committee of the CPC (formerly the Marxist-Leninist College of the Central Committee of the CPC). The materials mentioned by Comrade Glezerman in this letter, "Summary of Philosophy Teaching in the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Classes of the Second Department of the Marxist-Leninist College" and "Experience of Philosophy Teaching in the Second Department of the Marxist-Leninist College," were published in the first issue of the "Study" magazine in 1955 and in this newspaper on January 11, 1955, respectively.
    Combining theory with practice is the fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and also the fundamental method of studying Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly emphasized this point. The rectification movement of the Chinese Communist Party has also proved this point. The Advanced Party School directly under the Central Committee of the CPC, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the experience of our Party's rectification study, has specifically implemented the teaching policy of combining theory with practice and has achieved good results in philosophy teaching. Comrade Glezerman emphasized the importance of this experience in this letter and also introduced the Soviet experience in teaching philosophy, putting forward the opinions and suggestions of the Soviet comrades. We believe that these are very important for China's philosophy teaching work.

Respected Comrade Yang Xianzhen:

    The Teaching and Research Office of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism of the Academy of Social Sciences directly under the Central Committee of the CPSU, at a meeting of the Teaching and Research Office, discussed the materials you sent: "Summary of Philosophy Teaching in the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Classes of the Second Department of the Marxist-Leninist College" and "Experience of Philosophy Teaching in the Second Department of the Marxist-Leninist College."

    We studied your experience with great interest. Naturally, the materials sent lacked detailed explanations of the teaching syllabus and lecture content, and we have not been able to gain a complete understanding of this experience. Despite this, based on the materials already explained, it can be seen that your experience is very instructive.

    First of all, we believe that the most valuable thing is your sharp opposition to the tendency of dogmatism and empiricism in learning. The tendency of dogmatism confines the study of Marxism-Leninism to rote memorization of concepts and terms, while neglecting the connection with practical activities. The tendency of empiricism, on the other hand, neglects the significance of studying theory.

    The combination of theory and practice is the most valuable aspect of your experience. This is fully in line with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, this method can explain theoretical principles in a form that is easiest for students to understand. As a result of the connection with practice, theoretical principles become the easiest things for listeners to comprehend.

    The comrades of the Teaching and Research Office who participated in the discussion also emphasized the great value of your in-depth and specific research on students. Many comrades, such as Professor Gak, Professor Korbanovsky, Associate Professor Khrustov, and Associate Professor Sharikov, unanimously pointed out that there are many things in your experience that are also very instructive for us, for Soviet philosophy teachers. For example, one comrade said in his speech: "The entire teaching is permeated with a guiding ideology—that is, applying Marxist-Leninist principles in practical activities. The entire teaching demonstrates Marxism-Leninism in action. The theoretical conclusions drawn from the basic chapters of the philosophy course are noteworthy. For example, the conclusion drawn from the chapter on Marxist philosophy materialism is that we must oppose subjectivism; the conclusion drawn from dialectical materialism is that we must oppose one-sidedness and superficiality in judging various phenomena of social life; finally, the conclusion drawn from the part on historical materialism is that we must correctly understand the role of the masses of the people."

    We also believe that your efforts in demonstrating the organic connection between worldview and practical work, the style of the Party and state work, are also very valuable. This makes the students realize that the issues of dialectical materialism and historical materialism they have learned are directly related to any practical work. They should use these things and treat them as a guide to action.

    We also believe that the organic connection between studying theory and implementing the principle of criticism and self-criticism is also an important and valuable experience. After studying your materials, we realize that the theoretical study of the Marxist-Leninist College is organized in such a way that the comrades who listen to the lectures should connect the courses they study with the transformation of their own views. They should overcome the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois worldviews, boldly expose their past mistakes, and use Marxist-Leninist ideological methods to examine their practical activities. There is no doubt that this conscious and practical self-criticism is an important method for creatively mastering Marxism-Leninism.

    When discussing the materials you sent, the comrades of the Teaching and Research Office of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism also talked about the Soviet experience in teaching philosophy. They are very pleased to point out that these experiences are also being used in China, and, in their opinion, these experiences still maintain their role.

    The history of Soviet research and teaching of philosophy shows us that, first, we must oppose the separation of theory from practice, which is a characteristic inherent in the idealism of some Menshevik factions in the Soviet Union at that time. Second, we must oppose the simplified interpretation of the connection between theory and practice. In the early 1930s, criticism was launched in our Party journals, criticizing the attempt to directly attach dialectics to any technical department by labeling practical work departments—such as the fishing industry and the steel industry—with dialectical categories. The danger of this simplified understanding of the connection between theory and practice that we are talking about still exists in the current teaching process of dialectical materialism and historical materialism.

    Comrades have noted that errors in practical work are not always the result of defects in people's worldviews. Of course, erroneous strategies in political struggles have their theoretical roots. However, if we want to derive conclusions of idealism, metaphysics, individualism, etc. from all errors of a practical nature, then we run the risk of taking a somewhat simplistic path.

    The comrades of the Teaching and Research Office also noted that it may be difficult for comrades with poor cultivation to study original works such as Engels' "Anti-Dühring" and Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." It seems that this requires some auxiliary teaching materials. A popular narrative of dialectical materialism and historical materialism can help listeners understand. As for the works of Marxist-Leninist classics, we believe that it is best to start by selecting some works that are easiest to understand in terms of elaboration.

    Some comrades also raised the question that if possible, it would be beneficial to cite some materials from the history of Chinese philosophy when studying dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Of course, we understand that this is very difficult because these issues are not sufficiently studied in Marxist works.

    When you study Marxist philosophy, you combine the general principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, the strategy and tactics of Marxism-Leninism with the evaluation and analysis of your country's historical development, and with the study of Chinese history and the history of the Chinese Communist Party. We believe that this is a very valuable experience. In our view, it is precisely this path that can open up the broadest possibilities for the organic connection between Marxist-Leninist philosophy and the Party's policies.

    We are very interested in the philosophy teaching experience of the Marxist-Leninist College that you wrote about. Therefore, we suggested to the "Problems of Philosophy" magazine that this experience be published in this publication. It would be very good if Soviet and Chinese philosophers could establish a regular exchange of experience in the future.

    We wish you achievements in the work of ideologically arming the Party's cadres!
    Director of the Teaching and Research Office of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism of the Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee of the CPSU

    关于中共中央马克思列宁学院哲学教学经验
    ——格列则尔曼同志寄来的一封信
    编者按：这里我们发表苏共中央直属社会科学院哲学教研室主任格列则尔曼同志给中共中央直属高级党校（原为中共中央马克思列宁学院）校长杨献珍同志的一封信。格列则尔曼同志在这封信里所谈到的“马克思列宁学院关于第二部第二、三、四、五班的哲学教学总结”和“马克思列宁学院第二部哲学教学的经验”这两份材料，曾分别在一九五五年第一期“学习”杂志和一九五五年一月十一日本报上发表。
    理论与实际联系，是马克思列宁主义的根本原则，也是学习马克思列宁主义的根本方法。毛泽东同志曾历次强调过这一点。中国共产党的整风运动也证明了这一点。中共中央直属高级党校依据毛泽东同志的指示和我党整风学习的经验，具体地贯彻了理论与实际联系的教学方针，在哲学教学中获得了好的成绩。格列则尔曼同志在这封信里强调指出了这一经验的重要性，同时介绍了苏联讲授哲学的经验，提出了苏联同志们的意见和建议。我们认为这些对于中国的哲学教学工作是很重要的。敬爱的杨献珍同志：
    苏共中央直属社会科学院辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义教研室，在教研室会议上讨论了你们寄来的材料：“马克思列宁学院关于第二部第二、三、四、五班的哲学教学总结”，“马克思列宁学院第二部哲学教学的经验”。
    我们以极大的兴趣研究了你们的经验。自然，寄来的材料当中缺少教学大纲和讲课内容的详细说明，对这一经验，我们还没能获得完整的认识。尽管这样，单是依据已经说明的材料，就可以看出，你们的经验是大有教益的。
    首先，我们认为最可宝贵的，是你们反对学习当中的教条主义倾向和经验主义倾向的尖锐性。教条主义倾向使马克思列宁主义的研究局限于死记和背诵概念和术语，而轻视与实践活动的联系。经验主义倾向则轻视学习理论的意义。
    理论与实践联系是你们的经验的最宝贵的方面。这完全符合马克思列宁主义精神。同时这种方法能够以学员最容易了解的形式阐明理论原理，实际联系的结果，理论原理成为听讲者最容易领会的东西。
    参加讨论会的教研室的同志还着重指出你们对学员进行深刻的具体研究的重大价值。许多同志，例如加克教授、科尔巴诺夫斯基教授、赫鲁斯托夫和沙里科夫副教授，一致指出，在你们的这一经验当中，有不少东西对我们，对苏联的哲学教师，同样是很有教益的。比方说：有一位同志在发言当中说道：“整个教学贯穿着一个指导思想——这就是在实际活动当中运用马克思列宁主义原则。整个教学表明了行动中的马克思列宁主义。从哲学教程的基本章节当中得出的理论结论，都是值得注意的。例如，从马克思主义哲学唯物主义这一章所得出的结论，是必须反对主观主义；从唯物辩证法所得出的结论，是必须反对在判断社会生活各个现象当中的片面性和表面性；最后，从历史唯物主义部分所得出的结论，是必须正确认识人民群众的作用。”
    我们还认为，你们在表明世界观和实际工作，党的和国家工作的作风之间的有机联系方面的努力，也是很有价值的。这使学员们了解到，他们所学到的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义诸问题，同任何实际工作都有直接关系。他们应当利用这些东西，把它当作行动的指南。
    我们还认为，学习理论和实现批评与自我批评原则的有机联系，也是一项重要的宝贵的经验。研究了你们的材料，我们认识到马克思列宁学院的理论学习是这样组织的：听讲的同志们应当把他所学习的课程和改造自己的观点联系起来。他们应当克服资产阶级和小资产阶级的世界观，大胆揭发自己以往的错误，用马克思列宁主义的思想方法检查自己的实际活动。毫无疑问，这种自觉的实际的自我批评，乃是创造性地掌握马克思列宁主义的重要方法。
    在讨论你们寄来的材料的时候，辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义教研室的同志们也谈到苏联讲授哲学的经验。他们很高兴地指出，这些经验也在中国被运用着，而且，在他们看来，目前，这些经验也还保持着它的作用。
    苏联研究和讲授哲学的历史向我们表明，第一，必须反对理论与实践脱离，这是当时苏联一部分孟什维克派唯心主义所固有的特点。第二，必须反对对理论联系实际的简单化解释。在三十年代初期，在我们党刊上曾展开过批评，批判了用一种给实际工作部门——例如渔业、钢铁工业——贴上辩证法范畴的标签的办法把辩证法直接附着到任何一个技术部门的企图。我们所讲的这种对理论联系实际的简单化认识的危险性，在现在辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的讲授过程中，仍然存在着。
    同志们注意到了这种情况：实际工作中的错误并不总是人们的世界观的缺陷造成的结果。当然，政治斗争当中的错误策略，是具有它的理论根源的。但是，如果我们想从一切实际性质的错误当中引申出唯心主义、形而上学、个人主义等等的结论来，那末，我们就有走上某种程度的简单化道路的危险。
    教研室的同志们还注意到，对修养较差的同志们，学习像恩格斯著“反杜林论”、列宁著“唯物主义与经验批判主义”等原著，恐怕是有一定困难的。看来，这需要有某种辅助教材。辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的通俗叙述，能够帮助听讲者领会。至于马克思列宁主义经典作家的著作，我们认为最好开始时选读一些在阐述性质上最容易理解的著作。
    有一些同志还提出了这样的问题：如果可能，在研究辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的时候，从中国哲学史当中引用一些材料，这样做是有好处的。当然，我们了解到，由于在马克思主义著作中，这些问题研究得不够，这样做是有很大困难的。
    你们在研究马克思主义哲学的时候，把辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的一般原理，马克思列宁主义的战略和策略跟对于你们的国家的历史发展的估价和分析结合起来，跟中国历史、中国共产党历史的研究结合起来，我们认为，这是非常宝贵的经验。我们的看法，正是这条道路才能够给马克思列宁主义哲学和共产党的政策的有机联系开辟最宽广的可能性。
    对你们写来的马克思列宁学院哲学教学经验，我们感到浓厚兴趣，因此，我们向“哲学问题”杂志提出建议，把这一经验在这个刊物上发表出来。今后苏联和中国的哲学家如果能建立一种经常交流经验的联系，那是非常好的事情。
    祝你们在从思想上武装党的干部的工作中获得成就！
    苏共中央社会科学院辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义教研室主任
  格列则尔曼教授
