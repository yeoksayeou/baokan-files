Observer's Commentary:

    The agreement reached at the Sino-American ambassadorial talks on the issue of the return of civilians to their respective countries has been widely welcomed by those concerned about the situation in the Far East. What everyone hopes for now is that both sides can implement the agreement and smoothly proceed with the discussion of the second item on the agenda, so as to achieve results that are conducive to easing the situation.
    However, one cannot help but notice that immediately after the agreement on the first item was reached, the American side made a distortion of the content of the agreement with ulterior motives.
    In the agreement reached on the first item, it is clearly stated that both sides, for the benefit of their respective nationals in the other's country, entrusted the governments of third countries to assist those who wished to return to their home countries; China entrusted India, and the United States entrusted the United Kingdom. Both sides expressed their agreement to the countries entrusted by the other side. However, when the United States Information Service (USIS) announced the full text of the agreement, it deliberately distorted the terms of the agreement, insisting that China "will invite the Government of the United Kingdom to assist all Americans who wish to leave China to return to the United States." At the same time, the USIS also attempted to make people believe that it was the United States, not China, that entrusted the Indian government to assist overseas Chinese in the United States to return to China.
    This propaganda by the USIS is a blatant distortion of the agreement and a reversal of the truth. Not only does the agreement itself not allow for such an interpretation, but the process of the talks also does not contain any facts that can be used to make such an interpretation.
    During the talks, the suggestion that China and the United States each entrust a third country to assist their respective nationals who wished to return to their home countries was proposed by the Chinese side; the Chinese side would entrust the Indian government, and the United States could entrust the government of the United Kingdom. The American side never opposed this suggestion. Therefore, the agreement was actually reached on the basis of this suggestion by China. According to this spirit, the matter of entrusting a third country to assist nationals in returning to their home countries should of course be done by the country to which the nationals belong, with the country in which the nationals reside expressing its agreement. The USIS is now attempting to reverse the facts and deceive world public opinion in order to achieve some purpose, which is obviously a very disgraceful means.
    Even from the point of view of common sense, this distorted propaganda by the USIS is completely untenable. In the absence of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries, the two governments can only entrust third countries to take care of the interests of their respective nationals in the other's territory. The United States government claims to be concerned about its nationals in China, but the USIS's distorted propaganda gives the impression that it is unwilling to act in accordance with the agreement, and instead of coming forward itself to entrust a third country to assist them, it wants to shift this responsibility to China. The USIS's propaganda clearly shows that the United States is attempting to use this method to obstruct China from implementing the agreement and entrusting a third country to assist overseas Chinese in the United States to return to China. This is clearly the "Cold War" mentality at work. This is not only opposed by the Chinese people, but also by all those who demand a relaxation of the situation in the Far East.
    In order for the agreement to be implemented as soon as possible, China and the United States must now immediately complete the formalities of entrusting third countries to assist their respective nationals in returning to their home countries and expressing their agreement to the other party's entrustment of a third country. That is to say, the United States should entrust the government of the United Kingdom, and China should express its agreement to this; China should entrust the Indian government, and the United States should also express its agreement to this. If the United States does not issue a mandate to the government of the United Kingdom, then the implementation of the agreement will be hindered, which is the most basic principle. Now, the American side openly says that it will not discuss the second item on the agenda until the agreement on the first item has been fully implemented, but at the same time, it distorts the agreement and says that China should entrust the government of the United Kingdom, thereby making it impossible for the agreement to be implemented as soon as possible; is this not an attempt to deliberately delay the talks and obstruct the implementation of the agreement?
    The USIS's plan to distort the agreement is futile. A solemn agreement cannot be distorted. Many people expect the agreement that has been reached to be implemented as soon as possible. People who wish to return to their home countries, in particular, are eagerly awaiting it. If the United States is truly concerned about this, it should not intentionally create obstacles.

### 不许歪曲协议

    不许歪曲协议
    中美大使级会谈在双方平民回国问题上达成协议，得到关心远东局势的人们的广泛欢迎。现在大家所希望的是双方都能够执行协议，并且顺利地进行关于第二项议程的讨论，以便得出有利于缓和局势的结果。
    但是，人们不能不注意到，紧接着第一项议程的协议达成以后，美国方面就对协议的内容作了别有用心的歪曲。
    在第一项议程所达成的协议中，明明是双方为了各自在对方国家中的本国人的利益，各自委托第三国的政府对愿意回返本国的人进行协助；中国方面所委托的是印度，美国方面所委托的是联合王国。双方对于对方所委托的国家都表示同意。可是，美国新闻处在公布协议全文的时候，却把协议条文故意曲解，硬说什么中国“将邀请联合王国政府协助一切愿意离开中国的美国人返回美国”。同时，美国新闻处又企图使人以为委托印度政府协助在美华侨回国的不是中国，而是美国。
    美国新闻处的这种宣传是公然歪曲协议，颠倒事实的真相。不仅协议本身不能作这样的解释，就是会谈的过程也不存在可以被利用来作这样解释的事实。
    在会谈过程中，中美双方各自委托第三国来协助各自在对方的愿意回国的侨民回国这个建议，是中国方面提出来的；中国方面将委托印度政府，美国可委托联合王国政府。美国方面对这个建议从来没有表示反对。因此，协议实际上是在中国这个建议的基础上达成的。根据这种精神来实施协议，委托第三国协助侨民回国的事当然只能由侨民所属国来做，而由侨民住在国表示同意。美国新闻处现在为了达到某种目的，却企图颠倒事实，蒙蔽世界舆论，这显然是一种很不光彩的手段。
    就是从普通常识的观点来看，美国新闻处的这种歪曲宣传也是完全站不住脚的。在两国之间没有正常外交关系的情况下，两国政府只能各自委托第三国来照顾彼此在对方领土上的侨民的利益。美国政府口口声声说它关心它的在华侨民，但美国新闻处的歪曲宣传却给人一种印象，好像它不愿按照协议办事，自己出面委托第三国来协助他们，却想把这个责任推在中国身上。美国新闻处的这种宣传显然表明，美国企图用这个办法来阻挠中国执行协议，委托第三国协助在美华侨回国。这明明是“冷战”的打算在那里作怪。这不但中国人民反对，所有要求和缓远东局势的人都是要反对的。
    为了使协议尽速得到实施，中美双方现在必须立即履行各自委托第三国协助本国侨民回国和对对方委托第三国表示同意的手续。这就是说，美国应该委托联合王国政府，而中国对此表示同意；中国委托印度政府，美国也对此表示同意。如果美国不向联合王国政府发出委托，那末协议的执行就要受到阻碍，这是最起码的道理。现在美国方面一面公然说，在第一项议程的协议没有完全实施以前，不谈第二项议程的问题，一面却又歪曲协议，说要中国去委托联合王国政府，从而使协议无法尽速实施；这不是企图故意拖延会谈，阻挠协议的实施，又是什么呢？
    美国新闻处歪曲协议的打算是徒劳的。庄严的协议决不容许歪曲。许多人都期待已经达成的协议尽速实施。双方愿意回国的人们尤其是殷切盼望着。美国如果是真正关心这一点，它就不应该有意横生枝节。
