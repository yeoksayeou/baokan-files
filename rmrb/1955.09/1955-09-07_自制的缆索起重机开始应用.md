    Self-Made Cable Crane Begins Application
    A cable crane made in China has been put into use at the construction site of the Donggang Town Yellow River Arch Bridge on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway.
    This cable crane includes two lifting steel towers and a set of cables capable of spanning the Yellow River. It lifts high, transports far, and can lift steel frames weighing several thousand catties, cross the Yellow River, and send them to any location in the heart of the river.
    This cable crane was successfully trial-produced by the employees of our country's bridge factory according to Soviet designs. Using cable cranes to build arch bridges with large spans is also a Soviet experience. (Xinhua News Agency)

    自制的缆索起重机开始应用
    中国自制的一台缆索起重机，已在包兰铁路东岗镇黄河大拱桥工地上应用。
    这台缆索起重机包括两座起重钢塔和一套能够横跨黄河的缆索。它吊得高，运得远，能吊起几千斤重的钢架，横过黄河上空，送到河心的任何地点。
    这台缆索起重机是我国桥梁工厂职工根据苏联设计试制成功的。使用缆索起重机修筑跨度很大的拱桥，也是苏联的经验。　（新华社）
