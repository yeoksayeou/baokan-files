    Ten Years of Victory - Ten Thousand Years of Victory
    Lao She
    This September 3rd marks the tenth anniversary of our victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    In these ten years, how great have been the changes in China! I'm afraid no book could correctly and concisely (let alone exhaustively) introduce these changes, right? Especially since I only intend to write a short article now, I really don't know where to begin!

    I can only talk about personal feelings. Even these feelings may not be written well, as there are simply too many and too great things. Just a random thought, some things, although they happened several years ago, still make people tremble when they think about them now; other things make people ecstatic and sing loudly. It's really not easy to describe well.

    Really, when I think of the situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas after the victory and before liberation, how can I not tremble? Let me just talk about this; it's not without benefit to not forget the things that make you tremble. The collusion between American imperialism and the Chiang bandits, their double oppression, truly made me feel like I was walking into hell wherever I went. Those who remember those facts, please think about it, wasn't it really like this? Just to talk about some personal pain: the one yuan you painstakingly earned with blood and sweat, hum, it devalued to thirty cents in the blink of an eye! You can only calculate: should you starve yourself or let your children starve? Thirty cents—originally earned as one yuan—cannot feed a family. You know full well that those blood-sucking bureaucrats, warlords, profiteers, and bullies are becoming increasingly wealthy because of this, living in foreign buildings and mansions, wearing American-made leather shoes and silk stockings, eating American apples and delicacies from land and sea, and counting piles of American dollars. You know full well that their extravagance and debauchery are because they have sucked your blood dry. But what can you do? You call to heaven, but it doesn't answer; you call to earth, but it doesn't respond. Living under American and Chiang rule, you can only die at their hands. There is no other option.

    Do you have opinions? Who can not have opinions? However, you must be submissive and silent; even so, you may not be able to save your life. The secret agents trained by the American and Chiang forces are so domineering; killing your entire family for no reason is like wiping out a group of insects. Dare you speak? Even if you don't speak and are careful everywhere, you cannot escape your fate. You or your children might be run over and killed by an American jeep that drives onto the sidewalk. Do you plan to seek justice? Where to go? You or your children being run over by an American jeep should be an "honor"!

    If this isn't hell, what is it? Beijing, the ancient city of culture, was like this, it was hell! Beijing was like this, and everywhere else where the Kuomintang was present was the same.

    Liberation came, and Chairman Mao came to Beijing. Let's talk about those personal things first: money is money again, no longer something that devalues faster and faster, like an ice cream stick. Prices are stable, and you no longer have to get up in the middle of the night to wait and scramble to buy coal, rice, firewood, and charcoal, and even then, you may not get them. You are at ease. This is such a remarkable thing! You can sleep peacefully, no longer having your heart jump out of your chest when you hear a knock at the door at night, whether it's your door or your neighbor's. Yes, after liberation, there are still times when there are knocks at the door at night, but it's the people's police or the old neighborhood elder coming to tell you that you haven't closed your doors and windows properly, or that you haven't turned off the lights. You no longer have to worry about your children; when they go out, they will no longer be arrested and imprisoned. In a word: after liberation, people are people again, no longer the targets of secret agents' beatings and massacres.

    Ah, people are people; no longer slaves, insects, this is such a big change! Moreover, that is what is written in the constitution: All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. People's hearts are at peace, and they are all happily putting their energy into working; the heart is no longer used solely for worrying and fearing, but to consider how to live better, how to strive for progress. People's minds are liberated, and their strength is liberated. Isn't this the biggest change?

    The Huai River caused trouble? Chairman Mao said: We must harness the Huai River well! So we went and really harnessed the Huai River! Now, Chairman Mao says to make the Yellow River clear. The Yellow River will definitely be clear! Definitely! Who hasn't forgotten what the Chiang bandits said and did? They breached the Yellow River! This is what he said and what he did, and tens of thousands of people died in his hands in one fell swoop! Today, can someone just die casually? No such thing!

    It's not just waterways. Everything is planned. We have a Five-Year Plan. This great plan arranges everything properly for all construction, so that we all know what to do and how to do it, and doing things according to plan is of great benefit to the country and to ourselves. Before liberation, we were truly, "Tonight we take off our shoes and socks, but we don't know if we'll wear them tomorrow." But today, we not only know where we are going and when we will get there, but also know where the people of the whole country are going and when they will get there, and also know where our descendants are going and where they will get to! How remarkable is this! Where are we going? Towards socialism! What a stirring thing! Look ahead, you can see decades into the future at a glance, each year brighter, happier, and more beautiful than the last. Before liberation, getting up in the morning and feeling your head was still on your neck was a great blessing! Now, you are indeed alive; before, you were at best just getting through the day! According to the way we lived before, the entire nation had no way out. According to the way we live today, today you are a person with dignity, work, and hope; tomorrow you will be more dignified, happier, and more fortunate! Ten years of change, we are moving from hell towards paradise on earth!

    After liberation, the improvement of our international status is unprecedented in the last hundred years! The Chinese people have indeed stood up! However, we will never invade anyone; our strength is to defend ourselves and defend peace. The days of imperialist jeeps running amok and killing Chinese people at will are gone forever!

    So, how can we not sincerely thank Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the revolutionary martyrs? The ever-improving changes that we are experiencing today are bought with their precious blood. Can we turn a blind eye and allow those counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage our construction? The counter-revolutionaries want to restore the old forces, to ride on your and my necks again, to make us afraid to sleep soundly, to make us hand over all the money we have worked so hard to earn to them! Are you willing, are you willing to hand over all the rights that Chairman Mao has given us to the counter-revolutionaries, so that you and your descendants will never be able to hold your heads high? Speaking from the heart, are you willing or not? Who can be so ignorant; of course you are not willing. Good, then bring out the revolutionary vigor you have learned in the past few years, actively participate in the revolution, and severely strike at the counter-revolutionaries. In this way, ten years of victory will become ten thousand years of victory! Think about the past, think about the present, and think about the future. After thinking, we will wholeheartedly follow Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao will definitely lead us to ten thousand years of victory!

    胜利十年——胜利万年
    老舍
    今年九月三日是我们抗日战争胜利的十周年纪念日。
    在这十年里，中国的变化有多么大呀！恐怕没有任何一部书能够正确而扼要地（且不提详尽地）介绍这些变化吧？何况我现在只打算写一篇短文啊，真教我从何说起呢！
    只好说说个人的感想吧。就是感想也不见得能够写好，事情实在太多太大了。只随便一想吧，有的事虽已过去好几年，到如今想起来还令人颤抖；有的事又使人狂喜、高歌。这实在不易描写得好。
    真的，想起胜利后，解放前的蒋匪统治区的光景，怎能不颤抖呢？我就说这个吧，不忘掉令人颤抖的事是不无好处的。美帝国主义和蒋匪的狼狈为奸，双料压迫，真使我走到哪里都像走进地狱。记得那些事实的请想一想吧，难道不真是这样么？光说些个人的切身之痛吧：你千辛万苦用血汗换来的一元钱，哼，一眨眼已贬值到三角！你只好盘算：是你自己挨饿呢还是教儿女们挨饿？三角钱——本来是当一元挣来的——没法使一家都吃饱。你明知道，那些吸血的官僚、军阀、奸商、恶霸都因此而越来越肥，住的是洋楼大厦，穿的是美制皮鞋和丝袜，吃的是美国苹果和山珍海味，数的是成堆的美金。你明知道，他们的奢侈荒淫是因为吸足了你的血。可是你怎办呢？你叫天天不语，叫地地不应。你生活在美蒋统治下，你只好死在他们手里。没有第二句话。
    你有意见么？谁能没有意见呢？可是，你必须俯首贴耳，一声别出；就是这样，你还不一定能够保住性命。美蒋训练出来的特务是多么霸道，无缘无故地杀了你全家正如抹了一群虫蚁，你敢说话？即使你不说话，处处留神，也逃不出厄运啊。你自己或你的孩子会被美国的吉普车追上行人道来轧死。你打算去伸冤么？上哪儿？你或你的儿女被美国的吉普车轧死应当是个“光荣”！
    这不是地狱还是什么呢？北京，古老的文化城，就是这样，就是地狱！北京是这样，别处，只要是有国民党的地方，都是这样。
    解放了，毛主席来到了北京。还先说那些切身的事儿吧：钱是钱了，不再是随时越化越小，像冰棍似的东西了。物价稳定了，你不必再三更半夜就起床去等着抢购煤、米、柴、炭，而且未必买到手。你安了心。这就是多么了不起的事啊！你可以安心睡觉了，再不用在夜里一听见拍门，不管是你的门还是邻居的门，就肉跳心惊。是的，解放后晚间还有时候拍门，那却是人民警察或邻居老大爷来告诉你未曾关好了门户，或是没有把灯火熄好。你不必再操心你的孩子了，他们出去，已不再会被抓了去下狱。一句话：解放后，人是人了，不再是特务毒打屠杀的对象了。
    啊，人是人了；不再是奴隶、虫蚁，这是多么大的变化呀！而且，宪法上就是这么写的：中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人的心安定了，都快快活活地把劲儿拿出来干活作事；心不再是专为发愁害怕用的，而是要去考虑怎么更好地生活着，怎么努力要强。人的思想解放了，力量解放了。这难道不是最大的变化么？
    淮河闯祸么？毛主席说：一定要把淮河修好！咱们就去了，把淮河真治好了！现在，毛主席说，教黄河清了。黄河一定会清！一定！谁也没忘了蒋匪说过做过什么吧？扒开黄河！这是他说的他做的，多少万人就那么一下子死在他手里！今天，可能随便死一个人？没有这个事！
    岂止河道呢。一切的事情都有了计划。咱们有了五年计划。这个伟大的计划给一切建设都安排得妥妥当当，教咱们都知道该做什么和怎么去做，照计划做事对国家和对咱们自己有大好处。咱们在解放前，真是“今晚脱了鞋和袜，不知明天穿不穿。”而今天呢，咱们不但知道自己往哪里走和什么时候走到哪里，而且知道全国人民往哪里走和什么时候走到哪里，也知道咱们的子孙往哪里走和走到哪里！这是多么了不起呢！往哪里走？走向社会主义！这是多么动心的事！往前看吧，一眼能看出几十年去，一年比一年更光明，更幸福，更美丽。解放前呢，早晨起来摸摸脑袋还长在项上就是万幸！现在，你的确是活着呢；以前，你最好不过是混了一天是一天！按照以前的混法，整个民族全无出路。按照今天的活法，今天你是有人格、有工作、有希望的人；明天你就会更尊严，更快乐，更幸福！十年的变化呀，咱们从地狱走向着人间乐园！
    解放后，我们的国际地位的提高是近百年来不曾有过的！中国人民的确站起来了！但是，我们决不去侵略任何人，我们的力量是为保卫自己，保卫和平的。帝国主义的吉普车横行乱撞，随便轧死中国人的日子是永远过去了！
    那末，咱们怎能不衷心地感激毛主席、中国共产党和革命先烈呢？咱们今天亲身体会到越变越好的变化，是他们的宝贵的血换来的呀。咱们能够睁着眼睛不管事，任凭那些反革命分子来破坏我们的建设吗？反革命是想恢复旧日的势力，再骑在你我的脖子上，教咱们睡觉都不敢睡实在了，教咱们把辛辛苦苦挣来的钱全双手“孝敬”给他们！你肯，你肯把毛主席给咱们的一切权利，乖乖地交给反革命，教你自己和子子孙孙永难抬头吗？说良心话吧，你肯不肯？谁能那末无知呢，你当然不肯。好，那末就拿出这几年所学到的革命劲头来吧，积极参加革命，狠狠打击反革命。这样，胜利十年就会成为胜利万年！想想从前，想想现在，想想将来吧。想过以后，咱们就会全心全意地跟毛主席走！毛主席一定会领导咱们胜利万年！
