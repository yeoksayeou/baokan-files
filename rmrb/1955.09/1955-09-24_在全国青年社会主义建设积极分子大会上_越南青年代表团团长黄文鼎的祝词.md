Comrades of the Presidium, distinguished activists, dear comrades and friends:

The Vietnamese Youth Delegation, participating in the Chinese National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism, extends, with boundless excitement:

	Respect to the glorious activists!
	Respect to the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism and the great Chinese youth!
	Respect to the socialist cause that is achieving brilliant successes on the land of China!

Comrades:

The great Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the esteemed Chairman Mao, have valiantly defeated American imperialism and crushed the counter-revolutionary cliques on the mainland; liberating and defending their homeland.

Today, the Chinese people, who are valiantly and resolutely advancing along the path of socialism, are becoming the pillar of the movement to defend lasting peace in the Far East.

The Chinese New Democratic Youth League, with its 14 million outstanding members as its core, under the direct education of the Chinese Communist Party, has made important contributions to the motherland in past battles and today's construction endeavors; from among them have emerged batches of heroic model figures, such as Comrades Liu Hulan, Huang Jiguang, Luo Shengjiao, Wang Chonglun, and Hao Jianxiu, who are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.

Today, as the Chinese people and youth are striving to carry out socialist construction, and as the people of Asia and the world are actively struggling to defend peace and strive for national liberation under the banner of peace of the Soviet Union, the Chinese youth are holding the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism in order to mobilize the youth of the whole country to use all their strength to build and defend the motherland.

The Vietnamese youth believe that the congress has great historical significance. The congress will powerfully mobilize the Chinese youth to strive to fulfill their glorious tasks, that is, to work with the people of the whole country to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction, and to liberate Taiwan, the territory of China, and crush the aggressive attempts of American imperialism.

The congress and the practical effects it will generate in the future will not only have an impact on the Chinese youth, but will also have an important impact on the Vietnamese youth and the Asian youth. The Chinese youth, who are building socialism, will be the pillar of the Asian youth movement. The construction work and struggle of the Chinese youth will powerfully inspire the Vietnamese youth, who are struggling for the unification of their motherland. The Vietnamese youth feel very excited and full of confidence, because they know that every achievement of the Chinese youth is also their own achievement. Besides the Soviet youth, the Chinese youth are the greatest and most intimate friends of the Vietnamese youth; on the road of struggle and building the motherland, the Vietnamese youth regard the Chinese youth as their shining example.

Comrades:

Under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho, the Vietnamese people have won the victory of the War of Resistance; we achieved the historic Dien Bien Phu victory and restored peace in our homeland. These great victories are also due to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and China, and the Vietnamese youth express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union and China.

During the War of Resistance, the Vietnamese youth, under the education of the Vietnamese Labor Party, have defeated the enemy. In battle, the Vietnamese youth have learned the spirit of heroic struggle from the Chinese youth; every heroic fighting example of the Chinese youth has inspired the Vietnamese youth. Liu Hulan is a shining example for many guerrillas active in the enemy's rear; the youth in the Vietnamese army call Huang Jiguang "the Chinese Matrosov." Following the heroic example of the Chinese youth, some shining examples have also emerged among the Vietnamese youth, such as the heroes Luo Wenqiu, Qu Zhenglan, Nguyen Thi Than, Phan Dinh Giot, and Nguyen Quoc Tri.

In today's peaceful environment, the Vietnamese youth are happily striving to restore the national economy and heal the wounds of war. The youth, accounting for more than 80% of the workers and farmers participating in the railway repair, have joined the people in repairing the railway from Hanoi to the Sino-Vietnamese border, and are repairing the Hanoi-Lao Cai and Hanoi-Nam Dinh railways. More than 90% of the railway construction labor models are Youth League members. More than 300,000 hectares of wasteland have been turned into fertile land; batches of bunkers have been leveled; countless mines and barbed wire have been cleared. The noble labor enthusiasm of the Chinese worker comrades who helped us build the railway and the achievements of the Chinese youth in building their motherland have further promoted the Vietnamese youth to actively carry out construction and struggle.

The Vietnamese countryside, ravaged by the evil imperialists, is being restored by the hands and songs of the Vietnamese youth. But, comrades:

Although peace has been restored in Vietnam, it has not been consolidated. Half of Vietnam is still ruled by American imperialism and the Vietnamese feudal forces. The people of South Vietnam have not enjoyed peace. The crazy enemy is still oppressing and exploiting the people of the South. The youth of the South are subjected to the enemy's terroristic suppression and forced into military service. American imperialism and its lackeys are trying to divide Vietnam, occupy South Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into a military base for launching aggressive wars against North Vietnam and China. This is their conspiracy, but it is only their illusion. They do not know that the Vietnamese youth who have defeated them, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho, and with the support of the glorious Soviet youth who are building communism and the great Chinese youth who are building socialism, as well as the youth of various people's democratic countries, will certainly have sufficient strength to overwhelm them and crush their conspiracy to divide Vietnam.

Vietnam must be unified, and peace in Vietnam must be consolidated. The reason why the Vietnamese youth have this firm confidence is because the struggle of the Vietnamese youth is not isolated. The recently published joint communiqués of the Vietnamese government and the Soviet government and the joint communiqués of the Vietnamese government and the Chinese government have further strengthened the Vietnamese youth's confidence in the future of their motherland.

The Vietnamese youth will strive to learn from the Chinese youth in order to consolidate and build North Vietnam and struggle for the unification of their motherland.

The Chinese youth will hold high the Party's socialist banner and march towards complete victory!

Taiwan, the territory of China, must be liberated!

Long live the friendship between the Vietnamese youth and the Chinese youth!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

In order to express the Vietnamese youth's growing friendship with the Chinese youth, we have brought some small gifts to give to our friends, and we hope that our friends will accept them. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上  越南青年代表团团长黄文鼎的祝词

    在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上
    越南青年代表团团长黄文鼎的祝词主席团，各位积极分子，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    参加中国全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的越南青年代表团以无限兴奋的心情：
    向光荣的积极分子们致敬！
    向全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会和伟大的中国青年致敬！
    向正在中国的大地上取得光辉成就的社会主义事业致敬！
    同志们：
    伟大的中国人民，在中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席的英明领导下，已经在大陆上英勇地战胜了美帝国主义，打垮了反革命集团；解放并保卫了自己的国土。
    今天，正在英勇地和坚决地沿着社会主义的道路前进的中国人民，正成为保卫远东持久和平运动的支柱。
    以拥有一千四百万优秀团员的中国新民主主义青年团为核心的中国青年，在中国共产党直接教育下，在过去的战斗中和今天的建设事业中，曾为祖国做出了重要的贡献；在他们当中涌现出成批的英雄模范人物，例如刘胡兰、黄继光、罗盛教和王崇伦、郝建秀等同志，他们都是中华民族最优秀的儿女。
    今天，正当中国人民和青年努力进行社会主义建设的时候，正当亚洲和世界人民在苏联的和平旗帜下为保卫和平和争取民族解放而积极进行斗争的时候，中国青年举行了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，以便动员全国青年用全副力量来建设和保卫祖国。
    越南青年认为：大会具有重大的历史意义。大会将有力地动员中国青年为完成自己光荣的任务而奋斗，就是说，和全国人民一道，为超额完成建设社会主义的第一个五年计划，为解放中国领土台湾、粉碎美帝国主义的侵略企图而奋斗。
    大会和大会今后所要产生的实际效果，不但对中国青年起着作用，而且对越南青年和亚洲青年也会起着重要的作用。建设社会主义的中国青年将是亚洲青年运动的支柱。中国青年的建设事业和斗争将有力地鼓舞着正在为争取祖国统一而斗争的越南青年。越南青年感到很兴奋，也感到信心百倍，因为他们知道，中国青年的每一成就也就是自己的成就。除了苏联青年之外，中国青年就是越南青年最伟大、最亲切的朋友；在斗争和建设祖国的道路上，越南青年把中国青年看作是自己的光辉榜样。
    同志们：
    越南人民在越南劳动党和胡主席的英明领导下，已经取得了抗战的胜利；我们取得了历史性的奠边府大捷，并在祖国土地上恢复了和平。这些巨大胜利的取得，同样有赖于苏联和中国的无私援助，越南青年对苏联和中国表示衷心感谢。
    在抗战期间，越南青年在越南劳动党的教育下，已经战胜了敌人。在战斗中，越南青年已经学习了中国青年的英勇战斗的精神；中国青年的每一个英勇战斗的榜样都鼓舞着越南青年。刘胡兰是活跃在敌后地区的许多游击队的光辉榜样；越南部队中的青年都称呼黄继光为“中国的马特洛索夫”。跟随着中国青年的英勇榜样，越南青年当中也出现了一些光辉榜样，像罗文裘、瞿正澜、阮氏膻、潘廷佐、阮国治等英雄人物。
    在今天和平的环境中，越南青年正在欢欣地为恢复国民经济、医治战争创伤而努力。占参加修复铁路的工人和农民百分之八十多的青年已经同人民一道修了从河内到中越边境的铁路，并且正在修复河内—老街和河内—南定两条铁路。百分之九十多的铁路工程劳动模范是青年团员。三十万公顷荒地已变成了良田；成批的碉堡已被扫平；无数的地雷和铁丝网已经被清除。帮助我们修建铁路的中国工人同志们的高贵的劳动热情以及中国青年建设祖国的成就，更加推动着越南青年积极地进行建设和斗争。
    遭受罪恶的帝国主义者摧残了的越南农村，在越南青年的双手和歌声下面恢复起来了。但是，同志们：
    越南的和平虽然已经恢复了，但是并没有得到巩固。半个越南仍然被美帝国主义和越南封建势力统治着。越南南方人民并没有享受到和平。疯狂的敌人还在压迫剥削南方人民。南方青年受到敌人的恐怖镇压并被迫当兵。美帝国主义和它的走狗企图分割越南，侵占越南南方，把越南南方变为对越南北方和中国发动侵略战争的军事根据地。这是它们的阴谋，但是这只不过是它们的幻想而已。它们不知道：曾经打败过它们的越南青年，在越南劳动党和胡主席的领导下，在建设共产主义的光荣的苏联青年和在建设社会主义的伟大的中国青年以及各个人民民主国家青年的支援下，一定有充分力量来压倒它们，来粉碎它们分割越南的阴谋。
    越南一定统一，越南和平一定得到巩固。越南青年之所以具有这种坚定不移的信心，因为越南青年的斗争不是孤立的。最近发表的越南政府和苏联政府的联合公报以及越南政府和中国政府的联合公报进一步加强了越南青年对祖国前途的信心。
    越南青年将努力学习中国青年，以巩固和建设越南北方和为祖国的统一而斗争。
    中国青年将高举着党的社会主义的旗帜走向完全的胜利！
    中国的领土台湾一定得到解放！
    越南青年和中国青年之间的友谊万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    为了表示越南青年对中国青年日益增进的友谊，我们带来一些小小的礼物，赠送给朋友们，希望朋友们收下。　（新华社）
