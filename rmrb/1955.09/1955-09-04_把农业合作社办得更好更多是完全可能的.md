It is Entirely Possible to Run Agricultural Cooperatives Better and in Greater Numbers
Li Jiping, Secretary of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Since the announcement of our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, the socialist enthusiasm of the staff and the broad masses of farmers in the Xingtai area has been newly encouraged. In order to realize the agricultural production targets stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan in our area to support national industrial construction, and to establish a preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Party organization in the Xingtai area is determined to run the existing agricultural production cooperatives well, and is confident that it can lead the farmers in the entire region to achieve basic cooperation during the first Five-Year Plan period.

Currently, the number of farmer households participating in the cooperatives has reached 34.8 percent of the total number of farmer households in the region. It is expected that this will increase to 51 percent in 1955, 67 percent in 1956, and 81 percent in 1957. Based on the demands of the masses and the practical experience of running cooperatives in the past, it is entirely possible to complete this task by consolidating on one hand and developing on the other.

The agricultural cooperativization movement in the Xingtai area is basically healthy. In general, the cooperatives have developed from mutual aid teams, from small to large, from few to many, and from points to areas. In 1952, 24 cooperatives were established on a trial basis in six counties, with 226 farmer households participating. In 1953, all 16 counties in the region carried out key trial projects. Counties with a better foundation, such as Xingtai, Shahe, Neiqiu, and Lincheng, began to develop in a planned and focused manner. Except for Nanhe and Julu counties, which had a relatively poor mutual aid foundation and each only piloted one agricultural cooperative, each district in other counties established agricultural cooperatives. In that year, there were 304 agricultural cooperatives in the region, with 6,106 farmer households participating. In the first two years after the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, they showed their tremendous power. All cooperatives increased production compared to the local farmers outside the cooperatives, and the vast majority of cooperative members increased their actual income, giving a good impression to the broad masses of farmers.

After the large-scale publicity of the Party's general line during the transition period and the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain in the winter of 1953, the farmers' socialist consciousness was greatly improved, and more farmers actively demanded to take the road of cooperativization. From the winter of 1953 to the spring of 1954, the agricultural cooperatives in the region had greater development, with the number of cooperatives increasing to 2,748 and the number of farmer households participating increasing to 49,851, accounting for 6.81 percent of the total number of farmer households in the region. In this year, the output of agricultural production cooperatives in various places was compared with the output of local farmers outside the cooperatives: 925 cooperatives had an increase of 10 percent, 671 cooperatives had an increase of 20 percent, 444 cooperatives had an increase of 30 percent, and 98 cooperatives had an increase of more than 40 percent, totaling 2,138 cooperatives, accounting for 77.8 percent of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the region. The output of 538 cooperatives was equal to the output of local farmers outside the cooperatives, accounting for 19.6 percent of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the region. 72 cooperatives experienced a decrease in production due to severe disasters or poor management, accounting for 2.6 percent of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the region.

In the past few years, large-scale bumper harvests have appeared in agricultural cooperatives in various places in the region. Last year, the Neiqiu Jindan Agricultural Cooperative produced an average of more than 400 jin of millet per mu on 380 mu of land; the Xingtai Junying Agricultural Cooperative has harvested an average of more than 410 jin of wheat per mu on 110 mu of wheat for two years, and high-yield wheat has yielded 820 jin per mu; the Nangong Gongjiawa Cooperative harvested an average of 180 jin of seed cotton per mu on 1,573 mu of dryland cotton. Because this cooperative removed field boundaries and merged many roads in the fields, it increased the cultivated area by 67.7 mu; this item alone increased grain production by more than 16,100 jin last year. The old cooperatives with a good foundation have been able to withstand disasters and increase production year after year. For example, the Xingtai Dongchuankou Cooperative's total income before its establishment in 1951 was equivalent to 222,500 jin of raw grain; after its establishment in 1952, the total income was equivalent to 269,300 jin of raw grain, an increase of 21 percent compared to 1951; although it suffered from water, drought, and hail disasters in 1953, the total income still increased, totaling 325,438 jin of raw grain. Because labor and land were used in a unified manner, this cooperative transformed 24 mu of terraced fields on the mountain into paddy fields; because of the merger of land plots, the cultivated area was also increased by more than 24 mu. Not only has the economic life of cooperative members improved, but their cultural life is also constantly improving. Many cooperatives have established spare-time schools, libraries, and clubs, and some cooperatives have also installed radios. These facts of increased production and improved living conditions have not only made the agricultural cooperatives themselves more and more solid, but also blocked the road of capitalist development in the countryside, and powerfully encouraged the socialist enthusiasm of farmers outside the cooperatives, exerting a great attraction on them.

Before the autumn harvest of 1954, a large number of farmers actively demanded to join the cooperatives again. The Party committees at all levels in the Xingtai area carried out a series of ideological education and organizational preparation work: continuing to publicize the Party's general line, the Constitution, and the mutual aid and cooperation policy with examples of the achievements already made in running cooperatives; strengthening the leadership of mutual aid teams; selecting and training a large number of backbone personnel and activists for running cooperatives; and so on. From before the autumn harvest of 1954 to the beginning of the spring of 1955, the agricultural cooperatives in the region had greater development again. By February 1955, a total of 6,798 cooperatives had been developed, and the number of farmer households participating accounted for 36.48 percent of the total number of farmer households. In terms of the number of cooperatives, this was more than double the number in 1954; in terms of the number of farmer households participating, it increased more than threefold. In Xingtai, Shahe, Neiqiu, and Lincheng counties, the number of farmer households participating reached about 70 percent of the total number of farmer households, basically achieving cooperativization; cooperative townships and villages appeared in other counties. There were 898 townships in the region, of which 305 were cooperative townships, and 934 cooperative villages with more than 80 percent of farmer households participating.

Judging from the development of the cooperativization movement in the past few years, the Xingtai area has implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of actively leading and steadily advancing the development of agricultural production cooperatives. Although a small number of staff members had impatient emotions in the cooperative establishment work, and a simple and coercive command style was produced in individual places, causing some things that were not conducive to the normal development of the movement; however, this was only an individual and temporary phenomenon. After the autumn of 1954, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, the Xingtai Prefectural Committee and the County Party Committees strengthened the specific leadership of the cooperativization movement and changed the practice of relying solely on a small number of full-time personnel to run cooperatives. This spring, in addition to the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels personally taking action, more than 1,000 county and district staff members were transferred to participate in running cooperatives, and the work of rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives was resolutely carried out. The shortcomings of some cooperatives not sufficiently implementing the policy of voluntary mutual benefit were quickly and largely overcome.

This spring, some people believed that too many cooperatives had been established and that it would be difficult to consolidate them. What is the actual situation? After rectification, the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives in the Xingtai area have been consolidated. 534 cooperatives originally had some production confusion and the members' thinking was wavering; after rectification, they were all stabilized. The livestock that were weak have mostly continued to fatten up and new livestock have been added. The members' enthusiasm for investment has also increased. According to statistics from 118 cooperatives in Xingtai, Baixiang, and other five counties, more than 257,500 jin of fine fertilizer and more than 110,000 jin of chemical fertilizer have been bought back with the members' investment (excluding the poor peasants' cooperative entry fund loans); in addition to buying fertilizer, some cooperatives also used the members' investment to dig wells and buy waterwheels, which strongly supported production. The members' thinking has stabilized, and the unity within the cooperatives has been further strengthened. Some households did withdraw from some cooperatives after rectification; however, the number of households withdrawing from the cooperatives accounted for only about 7 percent of the number of households joining the cooperatives, many of whom planned to "wait and see for another year" before joining the cooperatives again. Are the cooperatives that have been rectified and consolidated "struggling to maintain themselves without collapsing"? Just looking at their production achievements will show that this is not the case. According to surveys in Baixiang, Xingtai, Ningjin, and other counties, the wheat yield this year exceeded that of local farmers outside the cooperatives in more than 90 percent of the cooperatives. Just looking at the fields will show that the autumn seedlings of the agricultural cooperatives are generally growing better. According to the August inspection, the cotton of farmers outside the cooperatives has become old peaches, averaging only about four per plant; Julu County inspected the cotton growth of 63 cooperatives, and because these cooperatives did a better job in pruning and management, the old peaches already formed averaged seven and a half per plant. The members' enthusiasm for production is even higher, and the vast majority of cooperatives are consolidated.

Now, staff members at all levels feel that where there are agricultural cooperatives, there is vitality in the work. Party members and rural staff members in various places generally and actively demand to learn the skills of running cooperatives and to change from laymen to experts. The Party's village branches in various places take the initiative to organize backbone members of old cooperatives to help establish new cooperatives, exchange cooperative running experiences within the township, and actively organize and lead mutual aid and cooperation networks. Currently, there are 38,340 Party members and 28,450 League members participating in the cooperatives in the region. They and the poor peasants who have joined the cooperatives have become the backbone force of the cooperatives. They have made the greatest efforts in the work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives this year. For those members who were ideologically wavering, they went to carry out patient persuasion work; for some unreasonable phenomena within the cooperatives, they actively took the lead in carrying out struggles. In some cases where households still requested to withdraw from the cooperatives after persuasion and education, the farmers remaining in the cooperatives still insisted on running the cooperatives and running them well. For example, in Xinyi Village, Ren County, there was a cooperative of 18 households, 12 households withdrew, and 6 poor peasant households remained, who still insisted on running it and running it well. The broad masses of Party members, League members, and poor, lower-middle and middle peasant activists fully demonstrated their high degree of enthusiasm for taking the socialist road. Many backbone members of old cooperatives actively and voluntarily went out of the village to help new cooperatives solve problems. From May to July this year, the Prefectural Committee transferred 28 experienced cooperative directors from Xingtai, Shahe, and Lincheng to Ren County and Guangzong, which had a poor foundation, to help rectify agricultural cooperatives, and they were warmly welcomed by the local cooperative members.

Facts have proved that the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement has a certain foundation, and the broad masses of farmers support agricultural production cooperatives; the problem is not that the movement has developed too fast and has "rushed forward," but that the ideological and strength preparations of the leadership are not keeping up with the actual needs and demands of the masses. Now, staff members at all levels in the Xingtai area have paid attention to improving leadership methods and strengthening specific leadership by focusing on key points. The results of the comrades of the Party committees at all levels going deep into key points to study specifically have greatly enriched leadership experience and improved leadership levels, and have also played an active role in the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. In the future, the agricultural cooperativization movement will continue to develop further, and the existing experience will still not be able to meet the needs of the constantly developing new situation. We should continue to work hard to learn the Party's policies, constantly improve work methods, strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, maintain and cherish the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for taking the socialist road, and make agricultural production cooperatives run better and in greater numbers.

    把农业合作社办得更好更多是完全可能的
    中共邢台地委书记　李吉平
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划公布以后，邢台地区工作人员和广大农民的社会主义热情受到了新的鼓舞。为了在我们这个地区实现第一个五年计划规定的农业生产指标以支援国家工业建设，并且建立农业的社会主义改造的初步基础，邢台地区党的组织决心办好现有的农业生产合作社，并且有信心在第一个五年计划期间领导全区农民达到基本合作化。
    现在全区入社农户已达到总农户的百分之三十四点八，预计一九五五年发展到百分之五十一，一九五六年发展到百分之六十七，一九五七年发展到百分之八十一。根据群众的要求和以往办社的实际经验，一面巩固一面发展，完成这个任务是完全可能的。
    邢台地区的农业生产合作化运动基本上是健康的。一般的社都是在互助组的基础上，由小到大、由少到多、由点到面地发展起来的。一九五二年在六个县里重点试办了二十四个社，入社农户二百二十六户。一九五三年，全区十六个县都进行了重点试办的工作，基础较好的邢台、沙河、内邱、临城等县开始了有计划、有重点地发展；除南和、巨鹿两县因互助基础较差，每县只试办了一个农业合作社以外，其它各县每区都建立了农业合作社。当年，全区农业合作社有三百零四个，入社农户六千一百零六户。农业合作社刚办起来的头两年，就显示出了它们有巨大的力量，各个社都比当地社外农民增加了产量，社员绝大部分都增加了实际收入，给广大农民以很好的印象。
    一九五三年冬季，大张旗鼓地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线和开始实行粮食统购统销以后，农民的社会主义觉悟大大提高起来，更多的农民纷纷要求走合作化的道路。全区的农业合作社在一九五三年冬季到一九五四年春季，有了更大的发展，社数增加到二千七百四十八个，入社农户四万九千八百五十一户，占全区总农户的百分之六点八一。这一年各地农业生产合作社的产量同当地社外农民的产量相比较：高出一成的有九百二十五个社，高出二成的有六百七十一个社，高出三成的有四百四十四个社，高出四成以上的有九十八个社，共计二千
  一百三十八个社，占全区农业合作社总数的百分之七十七点八。产量同当地社外农民的产量相等的有五百三十八个社，占全区农业合作社总数的百分之十九点六。因遭受灾害较重或因经营管理不善而减产的有七十二个社，占全区农业合作社总数的百分之二点六。
    这几年间，全区各地农业合作社都出现了大面积丰产的事迹。内邱金店农业合作社去年三百八十亩谷子平均每亩产四百斤以上；邢台军营农业合作社一百一十亩小麦两年来都平均每亩收到四百
  一十斤以上，高额丰产麦每亩收到八百二十斤；南宫巩家洼社一千五百七十三亩旱地棉花平均每亩收
  一百八十斤籽棉。这个社因为去掉地界、合并了田间的许多道路，增加耕地面积六十七亩七分；只是这一项，去年就增产粮食一万六千一百多斤。基础较好的老社，已经做到了不怕灾害、连年增产。如邢台东川口社，一九五一年没建社的时候总收入折原粮二十二万二千五百斤；一九五二年建社后，总收入折合原粮二十六万九千三百斤，比一九五一年增加百分之二十一；一九五三年虽然遭受到了水、旱、雹灾，但总收入仍有提高，共计折原粮三十二万五千四百三十八斤。因为劳力和土地统一使用了，这个社把山上的二十四亩梯田变成了水地；因为合并地块，也增加耕地面积二十四亩多。社员们不但经济生活改善了，文化生活也在不断地提高。很多社建立了业余学校、图书室、俱乐部，还有一些社安装了收音机。这些生产增加、生活改善的事实，不仅使农业合作社本身越来越巩固，并且堵塞了资本主义在农村发展的道路，有力地鼓舞了社外农民的社会主义热情，对社外农民发生了很大的吸引力。
    一九五四年秋收以前，又有广大农民积极要求入社。邢台地区各级党委进行了一系列的思想教育和组织准备工作：用办社已有的成绩的实例继续宣传党的总路线，宣传宪法，宣传互助合作政策；加强对互助组的领导；大量地选拔和训练办社骨干和积极分子，等等。从一九五四年秋收前到一九五五年春初，全区农业合作社又有了很大的发展。到一九五五年二月份，共发展到六千七百九十八个社，入社农户占总农户的百分之三十六点四八。从社的数量上说，比一九五四年增加了一倍多；从入社农户上说，增加了三倍多。邢台、沙河、内邱、临城四县，入社农户都达到了总农户的百分之七十左右，基本上合作化了；其他各县都出现了合作化的乡、村。全区共有八百九十八个乡，其中合作化的乡已有三百零五个，入社农户达到百分之八十以上的合作化村庄已有九百三十四个。
    从几年来合作化运动的发展情况看，邢台地区是贯彻了党中央对发展农业生产合作社的积极领导稳步前进的方针的。虽然少数工作人员在建社工作中有急躁情绪，在个别地方产生了简单从事的强迫命令作风，发生了一些不利于运动的正常发展的事情；但是，这只是个别的、暂时的现象。一九五四年秋季以后，在党中央和省委的正确领导下，邢台地委和各县县委就加强了对合作化运动的具体领导，改变了只靠少数专职人员办社的做法。今年春季，除各级党委书记亲自动手以外，还抽调了一千多名县区工作人员参加办社，坚决地进行了整顿和巩固农业合作社的工作。部分社贯彻自愿互利政策不够的缺点很快就大体上克服了。
    今年春天，有些人认为社办得太多了，恐怕很难巩固得住。实际情况如何呢？经过整顿以后，邢台地区的农业生产合作社绝大部分都巩固下来了。有五百三十四个社原来生产有些混乱，社员思想动摇；整顿以后，都稳定下来了。牲口瘦弱的，大都继续肥壮起来，并且增加了新牲口。社员投资的积极性也提高了。据邢台、柏乡等五县一百一十八个社统计，已用社员的投资（贫农入社基金贷款不在内）买回细肥二十五万七千五百多斤，化肥十一万多斤；有些社除了买肥料以外，还用社员的投资打了水井，买了水车，有力地支持了生产。社员的思想稳定下来了，社内的团结也进一步加强了。部分社经过整顿以后确实退出了一些户；但退社农户仅占入社农户的百分之七左右，其中很多是打算“再看一年”然后再入社的。经过整顿巩固下来的社，是不是“勉强维持不垮”的呢？只看它们的生产成绩就可以了解，并不是那样的。据柏乡、邢台、宁晋等县调查，今年小麦的产量，百分之九十以上的社都超过了当地社外农民。到地里看一看就可以知道，农业社的秋苗生长得大都比较好。据八月份的检查，社外农民的棉花已成老桃平均每株只有四个左右；巨鹿县检查了六十三个社的棉花生长情况，这些社因整枝管理工作做得比较好，已成老桃平均每株有七个半。社员的生产积极性更加高涨了，绝大部分的社都是巩固的。
    现在，各级工作人员都感觉到：那里有农业合作社，那里的工作就有生气。各地党员和农村工作人员都普遍积极地要求学会办社的本领，由外行变成内行。各地党的乡村支部主动地组织老社骨干分子帮助建立新社，在乡内交流办社经验，积极组织和领导互助合作网。现在，全区入社的党员计三万八千三百四十人，团员二万八千四百五十人。他们和入社的贫农，成了社的骨干力量。在今年整顿农业社的工作中，他们都作了最大的努力。对于那些思想动摇的社员，他们去进行耐心的说服工作；对社内某些不合理的现象，他们积极带头进行斗争。在有些户经过说服教育后仍然要求退社的情况下，留在社里的农民仍然坚持把社办下去、办好。如任县新义村有一个十八户的社，有十二户退社了，留下了六户贫农，他们还坚持要办下去、办好。广大的党员团员和贫农中农积极分子，充分表现了走社会主义道路的高度的热情。许多老社的骨干分子，积极主动地出村帮助新社解决问题。今年五月到七月间，地委从邢台、沙河、临城抽调了二十八个有经验的老社社长，到基础较差的任县、广宗帮助整顿农业社，他们受到了当地社员群众的热烈欢迎。
    事实证明，农业合作化运动的发展是有一定基础的，广大农民是拥护农业生产合作社的；问题并不在于运动发展得太快了，“冒进”了，而在于领导方面的思想和力量的准备还赶不上实际的需要和群众的要求。现在，邢台地区的各级工作人员已经注意了改进领导方法，深入重点加强具体领导。各级党委的同志们深入重点具体钻研的结果，已经大大丰富了领导经验，提高了领导水平，对农业合作社的巩固也起了积极的作用。今后，农业合作化运动还要进一步发展，已有的经验还是不能满足不断发展的新情况的需要的。我们应当继续努力学习党的政策，不断改进工作方法，加强对互助合作运动的领导，保持和爱护广大农民群众走社会主义道路的热情，使农业生产合作社办得更好更多。
