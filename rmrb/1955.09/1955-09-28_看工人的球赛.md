    Watching Workers' Ball Games
    Wu Chongyuan
    Since the start of the football, basketball, and volleyball competitions of the First National Workers' Sports Meet on September 16th, they have attracted tens of thousands of spectators in the capital. After eight days and over a hundred preliminary matches, the best teams have now been selected and are engaged in intense and heated finals.
    Before the competition, some people said, "Sports activities among our country's workers have not been developed for long, so there's no point in talking about technical levels." Those who held this view were quite surprised after watching the matches. Because the worker sports teams that appeared before them were not necessarily inferior, even when compared to the strongest teams in the country.
    The basketball games were particularly praised by the audience. The male and female basketball teams from seventeen industrial systems, due to different foundations and conditions, varied in strength; however, all teams adopted advanced offensive tactics at high speed in the preliminary matches. Active, proactive, and fast basketball tactics are a new phenomenon in China's basketball movement and one of the goals we want to achieve in participating in sports. Judging from the scoring records, the six men's basketball teams that qualified for the finals—Electric Power, Locomotive, Education, Coal Mining, Store Employees, and the People's Bank—scored mostly over one hundred points in each game, with the highest score reaching one hundred and forty-four points. The women's basketball teams of Spark, Coal Mining, Locomotive, Education, and Store Employees also scored around one hundred points in each game. The teams that were eliminated in the preliminary rounds, the men's teams mostly scored seventy to eighty points per game, and the women's teams, except for a few, also scored around fifty points per game.
    Active, proactive, and fast offensive basketball tactics cannot be used by just any team, because it requires athletes to have comprehensive physical conditions—strength, speed, agility, and endurance—as well as a solid foundation in basic and cooperative basketball skills. Although the worker basketball teams participating in the competition have not reached perfection in using fast-break tactics, such as weaker defense and simpler offensive methods, these are shortcomings in progress. Especially after entering the finals through the preliminary rounds, each team has improved technically. Therefore, every game is in a moving competitive state that combines strength and skill. In the men's basketball game between the Locomotive team and the Education team on the 23rd, both teams adopted man-to-man fast-break and fast-defense tactics. Throughout the game, the scores of the two teams surpassed each other, creating a tense seesaw atmosphere. At the end of the game, the Education team lost to the Locomotive team by only one point. The two women's basketball games between the Store Employees team and the Coal Mining team, and the Education team and the Spark team on the 24th, were tense from beginning to end. The Store Employees team led by one point with a score of sixty-seven to sixty-five, and the Education team won by one point with a score of fifty-six to fifty-five.
    In the football matches, we also saw a general improvement in technical levels. The biggest feature is that the athletes of each team are very physically fit, have high speeds, and have also received some training in basic techniques. Many teams have already begun to use the triangular short-passing style of play commonly used by the Hungarian national football mixed team during their visit to China for matches. The new tactic of the "four-forward system" has also been widely adopted. In particular, the football players' awareness of shooting has been strengthened. In the past, our football players had great deficiencies in this area. In front of the opponent's penalty area, even with good shooting opportunities, they did not dare to make a decisive shot, but kept passing around, resulting in lost opportunities. In this competition, we saw football players raising their feet to slam the goal from as far as fifteen meters away, and many goals were scored in this unprepared situation. Of course, the accuracy of shooting is still relatively poor, and the movements are also a bit slow. Therefore, to achieve further improvement, football players still need to put more effort into training in basic techniques.
    Among the twelve football teams, the First Machine representative team is the most outstanding team. In the five games they played up to the 25th, they scored a total of twenty-nine goals and did not lose a single point. The Locomotive, Light Industry, and Spark teams also showed that they are very strong teams.
    In the volleyball teams, the Coal Mining men's volleyball team and the Education women's volleyball team have a high chance of winning, and they have won every game with a score of three to zero. In the competition, we saw many teams were able to execute beautiful "fast attacks," "cross-screenings," and other tactics that require a high degree of skill. However, generally speaking, the technical level of volleyball is still relatively poor. Some teams want to use tactics such as "fast attacks" and "screenings" before they have fully mastered the basic techniques, which inevitably leads to many mistakes. Like the men's volleyball game between the Seafarer's team and the Agricultural and Water Conservancy team. The average strength of the Seafarer's team should be said to be no worse than the Agricultural and Water Conservancy team, but because they used too many tactical plays, and their techniques were not yet up to par, they made many spiking errors, and coupled with nervousness, they ended up losing to the Agricultural and Water Conservancy team. This clearly illustrates that mastering basic techniques is still the most important thing.
    In the competition, we also saw the excellent new sportsmanship of the worker athletes. They implemented the spirit of not aiming for victory or defeat, but taking learning as their task. Some representative teams lost repeatedly in the competition, and the scores differed greatly. However, these teams did not lose their fighting spirit because of the failures. Like the Forestry representative teams of men's and women's basketball and volleyball, their technical levels were relatively poor, and they always lost a lot against some of the strongest teams. However, they always maintained their courageous and tenacious spirit in subsequent matches, accumulating some experience with each match, and playing better and improving faster with each game. This reflects the noble qualities of our country's working masses and is worthy of our promotion and learning.
    From the workers' ball games, we can also clearly see that the improvement of sports technical level must be built on the basis of widely developing mass sports activities. Among the workers, basketball is more widespread than football and volleyball, and football is more common than volleyball. Therefore, reflected in this workers' ball games, the technical level of basketball is higher than football and volleyball, and football is better than volleyball. The reason for this is that the wider the mass base of a certain sport, the more new talents will emerge, which will promote the continuous rise of sports technical level. The best examples before us are the First Machine football team and the Coal Mining men's basketball team. These two teams have performed well in the competition and have both qualified for the finals. Fifteen of the seventeen members of the First Machine football team are members of the Dalian Shipyard football team. Football is very popular in the Dalian Shipyard, and almost every workshop and department has its own representative team. In addition, there are twenty-two youth football teams composed of young workers aged seventeen to twenty-two. The athletes representing the First Machine system in this competition are ordinary workers such as fitters, riveters, welders, and gas workers who have grown up in the mass football movement of the Dalian Shipyard. The main force of the Coal Mining men's basketball team is also a grassroots mining area team. They are members of the Kailuan Coal Mine representative team. Basketball is one of the most popular activities in the spare time cultural life of the Kailuan Coal Mine workers.
    The ball games of this sports meet are a very gratifying start. Through this competition, not only will the technical level of workers' ball games be further improved, but also the workers' ball games will be more widely developed, improving the health level of the working masses and serving the great construction cause.

    看工人的球赛
    吴重远
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会的足、篮、排球比赛从九月十六日开始以来，吸引了首都成千上万的观众。经过八天一百几十场的预赛，现在已选出最好的几个球队在进行着紧张、炽烈的决赛。
    在比赛以前，曾经有人这样说：“我国工人的体育活动开展不久，现在还谈不到技术水平的问题。”抱有这种看法的人，在看了比赛以后，不禁大吃一惊。因为出现在他们面前的工人运动队，即使同全国实力最强的球队相比拟，也不见得逊色多少。
    特别受到观众赞誉的是篮球赛。十七个产业系统的男、女篮球代表队，由于基础和条件不同，在实力上是有强有弱的；但在预赛中所有的球队都采用了高速度的攻击性的先进战术。积极、主动、快速的篮球战术，这是我国篮球运动中出现的新现象，也是我们参加体育运动所要达到的目的之一。从得分记录上来看，获得男子篮球决赛权的电业、火车头、教育、煤矿、店员和人民银行六队，他们每一场的得分，大部分在一百分以上，最高的得分达到一百四十四分。女子篮球队的火星、煤矿、火车头、教育以及店员等队的每场得分，也都在百分上下。在预赛中落选的球队，男子队每场的得分大部分达到七、八十分，女子队除个别队以外，每场得分也在五十分左右。
    积极、主动、快速攻击性的篮球战术，不是任何一个球队都能运用的，因为它既需要运动员有全面发展的身体条件——有力量、有速度，有灵敏和耐久力的体能，同时还需要运动员有纯熟的篮球运动的基本技术和合作技术的基础。参加比赛的工人篮球队，在运用快攻战术中，虽然还没有达到尽善尽美的境地，如防守较差，进攻方法也较简单，但这是前进中的缺点。特别经过预赛进入决赛以后，各队在技术上又提高了一步。因此每一场比赛，都是处在力量和技巧相结合的动人的竞技状态中。二十三日，火车头队对教育队一场男子篮球赛，两队都采用了人盯人的快攻、快守的战术，全场比赛两队比分，相互超越，形成拉锯的紧张气氛。终场时，教育队只以一分之差败给火车头队。二十四日，店员队对煤矿队、教育队对火星队的二场女子篮球赛，自始至终是紧张的，店员队以六十七比六十五一球领先，教育队以五十六比五十五一分获胜。
    在足球比赛中，我们也看到了技术水平的普遍提高。最大的特点是每一个球队的运动员体力都很充沛，速度都很高，在基本技术上也有了一定的训练。不少球队，已经在开始运用匈牙利国家足球混合队在访问我国进行比赛时惯用的三角短传的踢法。“四前锋制”的新的战术，也普遍地被采用了。特别是足球运动员的射门意识的加强。过去，我们的足球运动员在这方面是有很大缺陷的。在对方的禁区面前，虽然有了很好的射门机会，但是不敢下决心猛射，还要传来传去，结果失去了机会。在这次比赛中，我们看到足球运动员远在十五公尺左右，就举脚猛扣球门，而且有不少球就是在这种乘其不备的情况下攻进去的。当然，射门的准确性还比较差，动作也嫌慢一些。因此，要得到进一步的提高，还需要足球运动员们在基本技术的训练上多下功夫。
    在十二个足球队中，第一机械代表队是最出色的一个球队。他们到二十五日为止的五场比赛中，共攻进了二十九个球，却未失过一分。火车头、轻工业、火星等队也显示出了他们是实力很强的球队。
    在排球队中，煤矿男子排球队和教育女子排球队获得优胜的希望是很大的，他们每一场比赛都以三比零取得了胜利。在比赛中，我们看到不少队已能打出漂亮的“快攻”、“交叉掩护”等需要有高度技巧的战术。不过，普遍地说来，排球运动的技术水平还是比较差的。有些队还没有完满地掌握基本技术，就想用“快攻”“掩护”的战术，不免出了很多错误。像海员队对农业水利队的一场男子排球赛。海员队的平均力量应该说并不比农业水利队差，但因为过多地运用战术的打法，而技术又还跟不上，因此扣误的球就很多，加上一紧张，结果反输给了农业水利队。这里很好地说明了，掌握基本技术，还是最重要的事情。
    在比赛中，我们也看到了工人运动员们优良的新的体育道德作风。他们贯彻了不以胜败为目的，而以学习为任务的精神。有些代表队，在比赛中连战连败，并且比分相差很远。但是，这些球队并没有因为比赛的失败就丧失了斗志。像林业代表队的男女篮、排球四个队，技术水平比较差一些，同几个最强的队比赛，总要输很多。但是，他们在往后的比赛中，始终保持着勇猛顽强的锐气，比赛一次就积累一些经验，一场比一场打得好，进步得很快。这正反映了我国工人群众高贵的品质，值得我们发扬和学习。
    从工人的球类比赛中，我们还可以清楚地看出，运动技术水平的提高，必须建筑在广泛开展群众性体育运动的基础上。在职工群众中，篮球运动比足球、排球运动来得广泛，足球运动比排球运动更普遍一些。因此反映在这次工人球类比赛中，篮球运动技术水平比足球、排球高，足球运动比排球运动好一些。它的原因就是某一项运动的群众基础愈广泛，新的人材就会涌现得愈多，就会促使运动技术水平的不断上涨。放在我们面前的最好的例子是第一机械足球队和煤矿男子篮球队。这两个队在比赛中都有良好的表现，而且都获得了决赛权。第一机械足球队的十七名队员中就有十五名是大连造船公司足球代表队的成员。在大连造船公司里，足球运动开展得很普遍，几乎是每个车间和科室都有自己的代表队，另外还有从十七岁到二十二岁的青年工人参加的二十二个青年足球队。代表第一机械系统参加这次比赛的运动员，就是在大连造船公司群众性足球运动中成长起来的钳工、铆工、电焊工和瓦斯工等普通工人。煤矿男子篮球队的主力，也是一支基层矿区的球队，他们是开滦煤矿代表队的队员。而开滦煤矿的篮球运动，是该矿职工业余文化生活中一项最喜爱的活动。
    这次运动大会的球类比赛，是一个十分可喜的开端。通过这次比赛，不仅会进一步提高工人球类运动的技术水平，而且必然会使工人球类运动更广泛地开展起来，提高工人群众的健康水平，为伟大的建设事业服务。
