    Vietnamese Workers Fight for Peace, Unification, Independence, and Democracy
    Huang Guoyue, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor
    In recent months, the Vietnamese working people have been striving to engage in peaceful construction, using the achievements of construction to commemorate August 19th and September 2nd – the glorious historical anniversaries of the Vietnamese nation; at the same time, they also serve as a commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the democratic republic system.
    On August 19, 1945, the Japanese fascists surrendered under the blows of the Soviet army. The entire Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, held a nationwide uprising, carried out the "August Revolution" and won victory, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Less than a month after the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the French colonialists, with the help of other imperialists, turned back to invade, attempting to once again put shackles on the necks of the Vietnamese people. However, deep patriotic enthusiasm and hatred for the colonial and feudal systems mobilized Vietnamese workers and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, to resolutely fight to the end, defend the independence of the motherland, and defend the free and happy life brought to them by the "August Revolution."
    The just struggle of the Vietnamese people has from beginning to end received the sympathy and enthusiastic support of peace-loving workers and people all over the world, especially the workers and people of socialist and people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and China, as well as the people of France, North Africa, and other French territories. Therefore, the Vietnamese people won a glorious victory, forcing the other side to sign a ceasefire agreement in Geneva in July 1954, restoring peace on the basis of recognizing the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
    After fifteen years of brutal war, today, peace has been restored in Indochina. Vietnamese workers and people feel infinitely excited. Frontline soldiers, ordnance workers in the deep mountains, and peasant women behind enemy lines all express their welcome to peace in the language that best expresses their wishes and happiness. Everyone is actively striving to realize the new task put forward by President Ho Chi Minh: "Strive to consolidate peace, realize unification, and complete independence and democracy throughout the country."
    In the process of fighting for this noble cause, that is, to realize the most urgent and legitimate aspirations of the Vietnamese nation, the Vietnamese working class and working people have a very important task: they must continue to strengthen their fighting will, take the lead in implementing "continuing to struggle for the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords," and in the North, "strive to restore the economy and increase production," heal the wounds left by fifteen years of war, gradually improve the people's lives, make the country rich and the people strong, and create conditions for striving for peace and realizing national unification.
    Peace has been restored, but the Vietnamese working people are still encountering many difficulties and hardships caused by the imperialist conspiracy of sabotage. In the industries in the previously enemy-occupied areas, many industries have been paralyzed due to the looting and destruction of machinery carried out by the other side before withdrawing from the North. A part of the workers, staff, and technicians were forced to go to the South, and hundreds of thousands of working people became unemployed. During the war, the enemy destroyed bridges, dams... coupled with several consecutive years of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and storms, which made the working people even more hungry and cold.
    In short, peace has been restored, and the Vietnamese people are facing a land cruelly ravaged by fifteen years of war of aggression, facing various huge difficulties left behind by the other side. However, the Vietnamese working people, with the spirit of self-reliance, launched patriotic emulation and learned from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and China, overcame many difficulties, and achieved initial results.
    The first victory was the successful takeover of the newly liberated areas, especially the takeover of the capital Hanoi, the Haiphong seaport, and the Hong Gai coal mine; from May 18, 1955, the entire North of Vietnam has been completely liberated. This is a major victory, a result of the Vietnamese workers and the entire people's eighty years of patriotic struggle and nine years of heroic resistance war, as well as one year of struggle to consolidate peace.
    In the arduous task of ensuring the smooth takeover of the newly liberated cities, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor guided various mass organizations, mobilized the majority of manual and mental laborers, resolutely defended labor and production, opposed forced migration to the South, and opposed the other side's violation of the ceasefire agreement. After the complete liberation of the North, the grassroots mass organizations gathered, united, and educated the working people of all strata, highly promoted their spirit of being masters of their own affairs, and established a solid foundation for the people's democratic regime, enabling it to smoothly implement various urban policies and protect the interests of the people and the country. Therefore, after the French army withdrew, various activities in the cities were immediately restored; the people lived a happy life, completely changing the painful and gloomy life during the enemy's rule.
    The Hong Gai coal mine immediately resumed production two days after liberation. The supply of water and electricity increased by 25 to 40 percent. The working people of Hanoi, since the restoration of peaceful life to now, have put forward 2,750 rationalization proposals, saving 875 million Vietnamese dong. Other enterprises such as the Ruixi Leather Factory, the Shangli Oil Depot, etc. have begun to resume production, and the Nanding Yarn Factory, the Haiphong Cement Factory... etc. are preparing to resume production. The production of various state-owned enterprises in the old liberated areas such as tin, coal, phosphate, paper, matches, etc., has not only increased in output, but also gradually reduced costs. In the first five months of 1955, coal production (excluding the Hong Gai coal mine) increased by 71 percent compared to 1954, and phosphate production reached 64.2 percent of the total production in 1954. In the production increase competition movement, the working brothers saved 2 billion Vietnamese dong, increased the output of 90,000 working days, and put forward 4,521 rationalization proposals, selecting 13,924 labor models and combatants in various factories, mines, and agencies. But even more widespread achievements have been made in restoring and rebuilding various small crafts and handicrafts, which are one of the main sources of livelihood for the working people of all strata in urban and rural areas. For several years, these industries have been declining due to the exclusion of goods from the United States, Japan, and France.
    In order to serve the restoration of industry and commerce and the development of production, the entire transportation system is also being slowly rectified and restored. The Hanoi-Muc Nam Quan railway has been built, and a large part of the construction plans for the two railways from Hanoi to Nam Dinh and from Hanoi to Lao Cai have been completed. In addition, 6,079 kilometers of highways and bridges have been rectified or newly built. Therefore, the General Confederation of Labor is absorbing more and more manual and mental laborers in various industries and in various aspects, and is playing an important role in organizing, educating, and mobilizing workers to carry out production competitions, restore the national economy, and build a prosperous, strong, unified, and peaceful motherland.
    Restoring and increasing agricultural production is the starting point for restoring the national economy. Therefore, reclaiming wasteland and restoring agricultural production in areas that were destroyed in the past due to the enemy's establishment of no-man's zones, as well as flood and drought prevention, have been given importance from the beginning. Now, 70,500 Vietnamese acres of reclaimed wasteland have been re-cultivated, the area of spring rice fields this year has increased by 170 percent compared to last year, and this year's summer harvest has increased by nearly 50 percent compared to last year. In addition, nine irrigation systems have been rectified and built, supplying the irrigation needs of 280,000 hectares of land, and 3,600 kilometers of earthen dikes and 355 sluice gates have been repaired, which has never happened before. Most importantly, the ongoing land reform movement has rapidly changed the face of the Vietnamese countryside. In the villages where land reform is being carried out, the land has returned to the hands of the peasants. The rural productive forces, which have been bound by feudal landlords for generations, are now liberated and are directly serving the construction of the motherland. Rent reduction has been carried out in 1,352 villages in 19 provinces, and land reform has been carried out in 735 villages in 7 provinces. These areas have a total population of 6,556,000 people. Now the work of rent reduction and land reform is still continuing. Up to now, 72 percent of the villages (excluding mountainous areas) have carried out or are carrying out rent reduction, and 32.8 percent of the villages have carried out or are carrying out land reform. On this basis, the agricultural production competition movement is developing more deeply and widely, and the worker-peasant alliance is becoming increasingly consolidated.
    In terms of education, in addition to the newly established People's University with 1,400 students, the total number of students in various specialized schools has also increased to 1,528, which is half more than the total number of college students in Hanoi before liberation. Now, in the newly liberated areas, the total number of students in public and private primary and secondary schools has increased by more than 22,000 compared to the period of enemy occupation. In particular, since the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has added 12 specialized schools, with 9,866 students. In the newly liberated areas and areas where land reform has been carried out, the work of eliminating illiteracy and improving culture among workers, peasants, and cadres is being vigorously carried out. At present, a total of 596,821 peasants, 92,860 workers, and 153,671 rural cadres are studying in or are studying in popular literacy classes.
    In terms of serving the health of the masses, great efforts have also been made. The number of newly built hospitals, beds, and doctors has greatly increased. In the first six months of 1955, the production of medicines has been able to guarantee the urgent needs of the people. The wage system, social insurance, and labor regulations have been gradually reformed to adapt to the new situation.
    Tens of thousands of unemployed people have obtained jobs, and they are excitedly participating in the construction of roads and dams, contributing their strength to the construction of the motherland.
    The above-mentioned major victories have been achieved due to the Vietnamese working people's spirit of perseverance, hard work, overcoming difficulties, and continuous struggle, the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the united front uniting the people of the whole country and the heroic Vietnamese People's Army, and the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries. The recent visit of the delegation of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh to the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia marks a further development of the relations between the Vietnamese people and the people of the fraternal countries. This further increases the strength of the Vietnamese people and greatly encourages the Vietnamese people to fight to defeat the conspiracy of the US imperialists and their running dogs to provoke war.
    While the people of North Vietnam are working hard to build a peaceful life and build the motherland, in South Vietnam, the US imperialists and their running dogs are doing their best to sabotage the Geneva Accords, sabotage peaceful unification, and conspire to divide Vietnam for a long time, attempting to turn South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into colonies of the US imperialists and military bases for preparing for war. The past year of peace has also been a year full of sins for the US imperialists and the war provocateurs in South Vietnam. The people in the South still have to continue to live in an environment where they do not even have the freedom to breathe and in an atmosphere of war terror. The US imperialists and their running dogs are creating a bloody conflict between them and the anti-Ngo Dinh Diem sects, causing thousands of civilians to suffer innocent casualties, and more than 100,000 people to become homeless due to the burning of their houses. Under the command of the United States, Ngo Dinh Diem's reactionary ruling machine carried out terrorist massacres, detained people who participated in the anti-war resistance, and armed suppression of the peaceful movement of the people of Saigon and Thua Thien and the struggle to demand the convening of consultative conferences. Since the restoration of peace to the present, they have carried out more than 3,000 terrorist massacres in the South, killing and wounding more than 4,000 people and arresting 20,000 people. They have abolished all free and democratic rights, trampled on the people's right to demand national independence, and implemented fascist rule. American capitalists continue to invest in South Vietnam and dump their goods in the South, making the South's economy completely subordinate to the United States. Many industries in the South have declined, many enterprises have closed down, workers have been dismissed, and the national bourgeoisie has gone bankrupt. The newspapers published in Saigon, although strictly censored, cannot hide the facts. They reveal that millions of people in the South are unemployed and displaced in the streets, and that tens of thousands of believers forced to migrate to the South are currently living a wandering life or languishing in rubber plantations and concentration camps. The corrupt and brutal fascist system in the South has further aroused the resentment of people of all strata, and they have resolutely risen up to act in unison to oppose the US imperialists and their running dogs.
    Vietnam is a unified and beautiful country, and the Vietnamese nation is a whole of 23 million people from north to south. It has a history of united struggle, and no force can divide it. The Vietnamese people are determined to smash all conspiracies to split their country, just as they smashed the invasion conspiracies of the French and Japanese fascists in 1945 and won a glorious victory in the patriotic war of the past nine years. Now, the Vietnamese people are determined to fight for the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords, to unify the motherland through free general elections throughout the country, and to prevent the outbreak of war again in Indochina, in order to defend national independence and defend peace in Asia and the world. Although, on the road ahead, the Vietnamese working people will still encounter many difficulties and hardships, especially the difficulties caused by the US imperialists' conspiracy of sabotage.
    The Vietnamese people are expanding and consolidating the national united front based on the strong worker-peasant alliance, which is a great force for consolidating peace and realizing unification. The Vietnamese people are fighting to complete the people's national democratic revolution. In order to complete this glorious task, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor is encouraging the revolutionary spirit of the manual and mental laborers of the whole country, working together with the people of the whole country to actively restore the national economy, consolidate North Vietnam, and vigorously promote the political struggle in the South, and continue to strive for a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam.
    With the correct leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the brilliant example and great friendship of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, as well as the generous and selfless assistance, and the sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world, the Vietnamese workers and the Vietnamese people will surely be able to defeat all the conspiracies of the US imperialists and their running dogs to re-launch the war, and defend and promote the great victory of the "August Revolution" and the nine years of heroic resistance war.

    越南劳动者为和平、统一、独立、民主而奋斗
    越南总工会主席  黄国越
    最近几个月，越南劳动人民正在努力从事和平建设，用建设的成绩来纪念八月十九日和九月二日——越南民族的光荣的历史纪念日；同时，也作为建设民主共和制度十周年的纪念。
    一九四五年八月十九日，日本法西斯主义者在苏联军队的打击下投降了，越南全体人民在胡志明主席的领导下，举行全国起义，进行“八月革命”并获得胜利，建立了越南民主共和国。
    越南民主共和国诞生还不够一个月，法国殖民者就在其他帝国主义的帮助下，回头来进行侵略，企图再一次把枷锁套在越南人民的颈子上。但是，深厚的爱国热情和对殖民制度和封建制度的仇恨思想，动员了越南劳动者和全国人民，在胡志明主席的领导下，坚决抗战到底，保卫祖国的独立，保卫“八月革命”所带给他们的自由幸福生活。
    越南人民的正义斗争自始至终都获得全世界爱好和平的劳动者和人民，特别是以苏联、中国为首的社会主义和人民民主国家的劳动者和人民，以及法国人民、北非和其他法国属地的人民的同情和热烈支持。因此，越南人民获得了光荣的胜利，迫使对方于一九五四年七月在日内瓦签订了停战协定，在承认越南、柬埔寨和老挝的主权独立、统一和领土完整的基础上恢复和平。
    经过十五年的残酷战争，今天，和平已在印度支那恢复了。越南劳动者和人民感到无限兴奋。前线的战士、深山里的军械工人、敌后的农妇，都用最能表达他们的愿望和幸福的语言，表示对和平的欢迎。每一个人都积极地争取实现胡志明主席所提出的新任务：“为巩固和平、实现统一、在全国范围内完成独立和民主而努力斗争。”
    在为这一崇高的事业，也就是为实现越南民族的最迫切的、正当的愿望而斗争的过程中，越南工人阶级和劳动人民具有非常重大的任务：必须继续加强战斗意志，带头执行“为正确实现日内瓦协定而继续斗争”，并在北方“努力恢复经济，增加生产”，医治十五年战争破坏所留下的创伤，逐步提高人民的生活，使国富民强，为争取和平、实现国家统一创造条件。
    和平已经恢复，但越南劳动人民还遭遇到由帝国主义的阴谋破坏所造成的许多艰难困苦。在先前敌人占领区的工业，由于对方撤离北方之前进行掠夺、破坏机器，许多行业都陷于瘫痪状态。一部分工人、职员和技术人员被强迫到南方去，数十万劳动人民失业。在战争期间，敌人破坏桥梁、堤坝……加上连续几年的水、旱、风暴等天灾，致使劳动人民更加饥寒交迫。
    总之，和平恢复了，越南人民面对着一个被十五年侵略战争残酷蹂躏的国土，面对着对方所遗留下来的各种巨大困难。但越南劳动人民以自力更生的精神，展开爱国竞赛，并且学习苏联和中国的先进经验，克服了许多困难，获得了初步的成绩。
    头一项胜利就是成功地接管了新解放区，特别是接管首都河内、海防海港和鸿基煤矿；从一九五五年五月十八日起，越南北方已全部解放。这是一次重大胜利，是越南劳动者和全国人民八十年爱国斗争和九年英勇抗战以及一年来巩固和平的斗争的结果。
    在保证顺利接管新解放各城市的艰巨工作中，越南总工会指导各种群众团体，动员了大多数体力劳动者和脑力劳动者，坚决保卫劳动和生产的进行，反对强迫南迁，反对对方违反停战协定。在北方完全解放之后，各基层群众组织集合、团结和教育了各阶层劳动人民，高度发扬了他们的主人翁的精神，为人民民主政权建立巩固的基础，使它能顺利执行各种城市政策，保卫人民和国家的利益。因此，当法军撤退之后，城市的各种活动都立即恢复了；人民过着愉快的生活，完全改变了敌人统治时期的那种痛苦、暗淡的生活。
    鸿基煤矿在解放了两天之后就立即恢复生产。水电的供应增加了百分之二十五至百分之四十。河内的劳动人民，自从恢复和平生活到现在，已经提出了二千七百五十项合理化建议，节约了八亿七千五百万越币。另一些企业如瑞溪皮革厂、上理油库等已经开始恢复生产，南定纱厂、海防水泥厂……等正在准备恢复生产。老解放区的各种国营企业的生产如锡、煤、磷酸盐、纸、火柴等，不仅产量增加了，而且还逐渐降低了成本。一九五五年头五个月，煤的产量（鸿基煤矿除外）比一九五四年增加了百分之七十一，磷酸盐的产量已达一九五四年全年产量的百分之六十四点二。在增产竞赛运动中，劳动弟兄节约了二十亿越币，增加了九万个工作日的产量，提出了四千五百二十一项合理化建议，在各厂矿和机关中选出了一万三千九百二十四个劳动模范和竞赛战士。但获得更广泛的成绩的还是恢复和重建各种小工艺和手工业，这是城市和农村的各阶层劳动人民的主要生活来源之一，若干年来，这些行业一直因遭受美、日、法等国家的货物排挤而在不断衰落中。
    为恢复工商业和发展生产服务，整个交通运输系统也在慢慢整顿和恢复。河内—睦南关铁路已筑成，河内至南定和河内至老街的两条铁路的建设计划已完成了一大部分，此外六千零七十九公里的公路和桥梁已经获得整顿或新修筑。因此，总工会在各行业、各方面一天比一天吸收了更多的体力劳动者和脑力劳动者，并且在组织、教育和发动工人进行生产竞赛，恢复国民经济，建设一个富强、统一、和平的祖国等各种工作中起着重要的作用。
    恢复和提高农业生产是恢复国民经济的起点。因此在那些过去因敌人建立无人地带被摧毁的地区进行开荒，恢复农业生产，以及防涝抗旱等工作一开始就获得重视。现在，重耕的荒地已达七万零五百越亩，今年春耕稻田的面积比去年增加了百分之一百七十，今年的夏收比去年增加了将近百分之五十。此外，还整顿和修筑了九个灌溉系统，供应了二十八万公顷田地的灌溉需要，整修了三千六百公里土堤和三百五十五处水闸，这是过去从未有过的事情。最重要的是，正在进行的土地改革运动已经迅速地改变了越南农村的面貌。在进行土地改革的乡村，土地回到了农民手中，被封建地主世世代代束缚着的农村生产力，现在获得解放了，正在直接为祖国的建设服务。已有十九个省的一千三百五十二个乡进行了减租和七个省的七百三十五个乡进行了土地改革。这些地区共有人口六百五十五万六千人。现在减租和土地改革工作仍在继续进行。截至目前为止，百分之七十二的乡（不包括山区）已经或正在进行减租和百分之三十二点八的乡已经或正在进行土地改革。在这一基础之上，农业生产竞赛运动日益深入和广泛发展，而工农联盟也日益巩固。
    在教育方面，除新成立的人民大学有一千四百学生之外，各专科学校的学生总数也增至一千五百二十八人，比解放前河内的大学生总数增加了一半。现在，在新解放的地区，各公、私立中小学校的学生总数比敌人占领期间增加了二万二千人以上。特别是自从和平恢复以后，越南民主共和国政府已经增加了十二所专门学校，其中有学生九千八百六十六人。在新解放区和已经进行了土地改革的地区，在工人、农民和干部中进行的扫除文盲和提高文化的工作正在大力开展。目前，已在或正在平民普及班念书的共有农民五十九万六千八百二十一人，工人九万二千八百六十人和乡村干部十五万三千六百七十一人。
    在为人民群众的健康而服务方面，也作了很大的努力。新建医院、病床和医生人数都有很大的增加。在一九五五年的头六个月中，药品的生产已经能够保证供给人民的迫切需要。工资制度、社会保险、劳动法规等方面，都逐步进行了改革，以适应新的情况。
    数万失业人民已经获得了工作，他们正在兴奋地参加道路堤坝的修筑工作，为建设祖国贡献出自己的力量。
    上述各种重大胜利的获得，是由于有越南劳动人民的坚忍劳动、克服困难和不断斗争的精神，有胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导，有统一战线团结了全国人民和英勇的越南人民军，有苏联、中国和各兄弟国家的慷慨无私的援助。最近以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团访问了苏联、中国和蒙古，标志着越南人民和各兄弟国家人民之间的关系的进一步发展。这一点，更增加了越南人民的力量，并大大地鼓舞了越南人民为击败美帝国主义及其走狗挑拨战争的阴谋而斗争。
    当越南北方的人民正在努力建设和平生活、建设祖国的时候，在越南南方，美帝国主义及其走狗却在尽力破坏日内瓦协议，破坏和平统一，阴谋长期分裂越南，企图把越南南方和柬埔寨、老挝变成美帝国主义的殖民地和准备战争的军事基地。过去的和平的一年，也是美帝国主义和越南南方的战争挑拨者的充满罪恶的一年。南方的人民仍然要继续生活在连呼吸的自由都没有的环境里和战争恐怖的气氛中。美帝国主义及其走狗正在制造着一场他们和反吴庭艳各教派之间的流血冲突，使数千平民遭受无辜的伤亡，十多万人由于房屋被烧毁而无家可归。在美国指挥下的吴庭艳的反动统治机器，进行了恐怖屠杀、拘禁参加抗战的人民、武装镇压西贡堤岸和顺化人民的和平运动以及要求召开协商会议的斗争。自从和平恢复到现在，他们在南方进行了三千多次恐怖屠杀，打死打伤四千多人，拘捕了二万人。他们取消了一切自由民主权利，践踏人民的要求民族独立的权利，实行了法西斯的统治。美国资本家不断向越南南方投资并且在南方倾销他们的货物，使南方的经济完全从属于美国，南方的许多行业衰落了，许多企业倒闭，工人被辞退，民族资产阶级破产。在西贡出版的报刊，虽然受到严密的检查，但也不能掩盖事实，它们透露了在南方有成百万人失业，在街头上流离失所的景况，以及被迫南迁的成万教徒目前正过着流浪生活或者在集中寨中和树胶园中消磨着生命的痛苦景况。南方的腐败和残暴的法西斯制度更激起了各阶层人民的愤恨，他们坚决起来一致行动，反对美帝国主义和它的走狗。
    越南是一个统一的锦绣河山，越南民族是一个从北到南的二千三百万人口的整体，它曾有过团结斗争的历史，任何力量都不能把它分裂。越南人民坚决粉碎一切分裂自己的国土的阴谋，就像他们在一九四五年曾粉碎了法国和日本法西斯的侵略阴谋并且在过去九年的爱国战争中获得光荣的胜利一样。现在，越南人民坚决地为正确执行日内瓦协定而斗争，通过全国的自由普选来统一祖国，并且防止战争在印度支那再起，借以保卫民族独立，保卫亚洲和世界的和平。虽然，在前进的道路上，越南劳动人民还会遇到许多艰难困苦，首先是美帝国主义的破坏阴谋所造成的困难。
    越南人民正在扩大和巩固以坚强的工农联盟为基础的民族统一战线，这是巩固和平、实现统一的一种伟大力量。越南人民正在为完成人民民族民主革命而斗争。为了完成这一光荣的任务，越南总工会正在鼓舞全国的体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的革命精神，和全国人民共同积极恢复国民经济，巩固越南北方，并大力推动南方的政治斗争，为一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南而继续奋斗。
    有胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国的正确领导，有苏联、中国和各人民民主国家光辉的榜样和伟大的友谊以及慷慨无私的援助，有全世界爱好和平人民的同情，越南劳动者和越南人民一定能够击败美帝国主义及其走狗企图重新发动战争的一切阴谋，保卫和发扬“八月革命”和九年英勇抗战的伟大胜利。
