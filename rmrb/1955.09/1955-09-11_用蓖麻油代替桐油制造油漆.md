    Using Castor Oil to Replace Tung Oil in Paint Manufacturing

    The Shanghai Municipal Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation and the Shanghai Yonggu Paint Factory have recently jointly used dehydrated castor oil to replace tung oil to produce several types of paint. The color and durability of the paint produced are exactly the same as paint made with tung oil. The Shanghai Municipal Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation is preparing to cooperate further with paint factories to expand production.

    Tung oil is an important industrial raw material and export commodity, and this oilseed takes a long time to cultivate. Castor is a drought-resistant plant that can be planted everywhere, and its seeds can be harvested and pressed for oil about half a year after planting. Castor seeds contain a lot of oil, but the water content is high, making it difficult to dry. They must be dehydrated before they can be used to manufacture paints and other coatings. The Shanghai Municipal Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation began experimenting with various dehydrating agents for castor oil dehydration at the beginning of this year and has only recently succeeded. In addition to replacing tung oil, linseed oil, and other drying oils in the manufacture of paints, inks, and many other products, this dehydrated castor oil can also be used in rural areas to paint various wooden farm tools and everyday furniture.

    用蓖麻油代替桐油制造油漆
    中国油脂公司上海市公司和上海永固造漆厂最近合作用脱水蓖麻油代替桐油，制成了几种油漆。制成的油漆的色泽和坚牢程度，和用桐油制成的油漆完全一样。中国油脂公司上海市公司正准备和油漆厂进一步合作，扩大生产。
    桐油是重要的工业原料和出口物资，这种油料的培植时间较长。蓖麻是一种到处可以种植的不怕干旱的植物，下种后半年左右就可以收籽榨油。蓖麻籽含油很多，但含水量大，不易收干，必须脱水后才能制造油漆等涂料。中国油脂公司上海市公司在今年年初开始，试用好多种不同的脱水剂，进行蓖麻油的脱水试验，最近才试验成功。这种脱水蓖麻油，除了可以代替桐油、亚麻仁油等干性油制造油漆、油墨等许多产品外，在农村中还可以用来涂漆各种木制农具和日用家具。　（新华社）
