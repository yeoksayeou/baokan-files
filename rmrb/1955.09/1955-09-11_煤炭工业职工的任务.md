The Tasks of Coal Industry Workers

In our country's first Five-Year Plan, the coal industry shoulders a glorious and arduous task. Within five years, there are 194 above-quota construction units in the coal industry, with a planned increase in annual production capacity of 53.85 million tons. Adding the output of existing enterprises, the national raw coal output will reach 113 million tons by 1957, an increase of nearly double compared to the 63.53 million tons in 1952. To fulfill and overfulfill the basic construction and production tasks of the coal industry, and to satisfy the needs of national economic development with a sufficient quantity of high-quality coal, is a very significant task for all employees of the coal industry during the first Five-Year Plan.

The coal industry is a pioneering industry for the country's socialist industrialization, and its development must adapt to the needs of the development of industry and transportation. As Lenin said at the First All-Russian Congress of Miners' Representatives:

“Coal is the real food of industry; without this food, industry cannot start work; without this food, railway transport must be in an extremely pitiful condition; without this food, all the great industries of the country will collapse, disintegrate, and degenerate into a barbaric primitive age.” Lenin's words have extremely important significance for us today. Because although our country's raw coal output has grown rapidly in recent years, the demand for coal has grown even faster due to the development of construction work in various aspects. During the first Five-Year Plan, coal production still cannot keep up with demand; in the early stage of the second Five-Year Plan, after the 156 key construction projects are put into production one after another, the demand for coal will greatly increase. In order to overcome the contradiction between production and demand, avoid or alleviate the situation of coal supply falling short of demand in the future, and ensure that our country's industrial development has sufficient "food," we must redouble our efforts to build new coal mines, tap the potential of existing coal mines, and fulfill and overfulfill the production and basic construction plans.

In order to victoriously complete this major task, we must first accelerate the progress of basic construction in the coal industry and complete the basic construction plan on schedule. This is the fundamental method for improving the level of coal production in our country. In recent years, 72 new coal mines and open-pit mines have started construction in the coal industry, 17 of which will soon be put into production one after another. The scale of coal mining industry construction is unprecedentedly large. However, judging from the progress of basic construction, the annual plans have not been well completed, and many projects have not started on schedule; the progress of those that have started is also slow. This situation is, of course, unsatisfactory. What is even more important is that the basic construction investment in the coal industry during the Five-Year Plan accounts for only 52.8 percent in the first three years, and 47.2 percent in the last two years. That is to say, half of the workload needs to be completed in the last two years. If the progress of basic construction is currently slow and the plan cannot be completed, it will further increase the burden in the last two years.

To accelerate the progress of basic construction in the coal industry, many specific measures need to be taken. First, we must further strengthen the leadership over basic construction. In recent years, under the leadership of local party committees, various units in the coal industry have vigorously implemented the policy of placing basic construction in the primary position, and have gathered a group of geological, design, and construction forces to undertake arduous basic construction tasks. However, it is undeniable that some units still do not have a sufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of basic construction in the coal industry, and have not seriously strengthened basic construction work in all aspects; there is also a lack of good collaboration between the various professional management institutions of basic construction. In the future, in addition to the geological, design, and construction professional management institutions strengthening their leadership over their grassroots organizations, the regional administrative bureaus and mining bureaus of the coal industry should also strengthen the inspection and supervision of basic construction work, vigorously support the work of the professional management institutions, assist in solving various difficult problems in basic construction, and organize coordination and collaboration in various aspects. The regular basic construction balance meetings convened by the regional administrative bureaus and mining bureaus in the past have proven to be an effective method for strengthening coordination and collaboration in various aspects and solving various problems in basic construction in a timely manner, and this work must continue to be done well in the future. Second, we must strengthen geological exploration and design work, which are the preliminary steps for coal industry construction. In recent years, the geological exploration and design forces of the coal industry have developed greatly and have done a lot of work. However, at present, they are still far from meeting the needs of basic construction in coal mines, and the serious situation in which geological exploration work lags behind design and design work lags behind construction has not changed. In order to change this situation, we must accelerate geological exploration with the greatest effort, so as to completely reverse the situation of geology lagging behind mine construction in two or three years. At the same time, we must also strengthen ideological education in design work, enhance the sense of responsibility of design personnel, improve the organizational management of design production, improve design quality and work efficiency, so as to shorten design time. Third, we must do a good job in preparation work before construction with all our strength, do a good job in the supply of equipment and materials, actively improve management and technical levels, improve labor productivity, and ensure that above-quota projects and special well construction projects start on schedule, are completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and are put into production, so as to achieve the increased production capacity stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

Fully utilizing existing mine resources to promote the growth of coal industry production is of urgent significance. From 1950 to the present, the coal industry has restored a total of 77 mines and renovated 114 mines, increasing production capacity by more than 48 million tons. At the same time, new mining methods have been promoted, the recovery rate has more than doubled, and the level of mechanization in coal mines has also been greatly improved. However, there are still many problems in coal mine production at present. Although the output task of state-owned coal mines in the first half of 1955 has been completed according to plan, the total output value, labor efficiency, and finances have not been completed according to plan. Even in terms of output, 39.5 percent of production units in state-owned coal mines across the country have not completed their plans. As for the phenomena of poor regular operations, failure to complete production cycle plans, low mechanical utilization rates, high equipment damage rates, many accidents, and poor coal quality, they are even more common. These shortcomings and mistakes greatly hinder the improvement of the level of coal production. To change this situation, we must continue to carry out comprehensive production reforms in the future, and gradually transform the technical equipment of the production and transportation processes of old mines with the new technical achievements of the Soviet Union, and gradually achieve mining according to the coal mining procedures, so as to give full play to its potential. At the same time, we must promote regular cycle operations, accelerate the progress of coal mining and tunneling, continue to strengthen the balance work of mine geology, tunneling, and coal mining, strengthen safety work, improve mechanical utilization rates, and conscientiously promote the experience of the Fuxin Ping'an One-Meter Layer. To this end, we must continuously improve and improve the management level of coal mining enterprises, master the methods of organizing balanced production, and strictly implement the system of strict economy, so as to safely and comprehensively complete the national plan month by month.

Accelerating the progress of basic construction and further improving production must rely on the masses, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and widely launch labor competitions. Not long ago, the Second National Congress of Coal Mine Trade Unions made a special discussion on this, and all coal mine workers should resolutely respond to the call of the congress. At the same time, coal mine trade unions at all levels should also improve their work style, strengthen specific leadership, overcome the tendency of formalism in labor competitions, and deeply help backward workers and backward units. In organizing labor competitions, learning and promoting the safe production experience of Shi Yuhai and Liu Jiuxue, the rapid tunneling experience of Ma Liuhai, Cui Guoshan, and Li Baoshu, the deep-hole blasting experience of Gu Faming, and the parallel operation of well construction, etc., is of great significance. Because conscientiously learning and promoting these advanced experiences can not only enable the backward to catch up with the advanced, effectively improve labor productivity; but also make the work of trade unions more specific, enable cadres of trade unions at all levels to closely contact the masses, overcome the style of bureaucracy, so as to lead all employees to actively complete and overfulfill the national plan.

With the efforts of all coal mine workers, the coal industry has successfully completed the tasks of the first two years of the Five-Year Plan. The tasks for the next three years are arduous and we must continue to work hard. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, as long as all coal mine workers continue to improve their political awareness and technical level, overcome difficulties, and strive to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan of the coal mining industry, it is entirely possible.

    煤炭工业职工的任务
    在我国第一个五年计划中，煤炭工业担负着光荣而艰巨的任务。五年内煤炭工业限额以上的建设单位有一百九十四个，计划增加年产能力为五千三百八十五万吨，加上原有企业的产量，到一九五七年全国原煤产量将达到一亿一千三百万吨，比一九五二年的六千三百五十三万吨增加将近一倍。完成和超额完成煤炭工业的基本建设和生产任务，以足够数量的、品质优良的煤炭满足国民经济发展的需要，是第一个五年计划期内煤炭工业全体职工十分重大的任务。
    煤炭工业是国家社会主义工业化的先行工业，它的发展必须适应工业和运输业发展的需要。正如列宁在全俄罗斯第一次矿工代表大会所讲的：
  “煤——是工业的真正食粮，没有这种食粮，工业就不能开工，没有这种食粮，就必然使铁路运输处于极其可怜的境地，没有这种食粮，一切国家的大工业都将崩溃、解体和退化到野蛮的原始时代。”列宁这段话，今天对我们有着极其重要的意义。因为几年来我国原煤的产量虽然增长很快，但是由于各方面建设工作的发展，煤炭需要量增长的速度更快，在第一个五年计划期间，煤炭的生产还赶不上需要；到第二个五年计划初期，一百五十六项重点建设工程陆续投入生产以后，煤炭需要量更将大大增加。为了克服生产和需要的矛盾，避免或者减轻将来原煤供不应求的情况，保证我国工业的发展有足够的“食粮”，就必须百倍努力地增建新的煤井，发挥现有煤井的潜力，完成和超额完成生产和基本建设计划。
    为了胜利地完成这个重大的任务，首先必须加快煤炭工业基本建设的进度，按期完成基本建设的计划，这是提高我国煤炭生产水平的根本方法。几年来煤炭工业开始建设的新矿井和露天矿有七十二处，其中十七处即将陆续投入生产。煤矿工业的建设规模是空前巨大的。但从基本建设的进度来看，逐年计划都完成的不好，许多工程没有按期开工；开了工的进度也慢，这种情况当然是不能令人满意的。而更重要的，还在于五年计划中在煤炭工业方面的基本建设投资，前三年只占百分之五十二点八，后两年将占百分之四十七点二，就是说一半的工程量需要后两年来完成，如果目前基本建设的进度迟缓，完不成计划，将会更增加后两年的负担。
    要加快煤炭工业基本建设的进度，就需要采取很多具体措施。第一，必须进一步加强对基本建设的领导。几年来煤炭工业各个单位在各地党委领导下，大力贯彻了把基本建设放在首要地位的方针，集结了一批地质、设计和施工力量，担负了繁重的基本建设任务。但不可否认，有些单位对于煤炭工业基本建设的艰巨性和复杂性还认识不足，还没有认真地从各个方面加强基本建设工作；而基本建设的各个专业管理机构之间，也还缺乏很好地协作。今后，除了地质、设计和施工专业管理机构应加强对其基层组织的领导以外，煤炭工业的各地区管理局和矿务局也要对基本建设工作加强检查和监督，大力支援各专业管理机构的工作，协助解决基本建设中的各种困难问题，并组织各方面的配合和协作。过去由各地区管理局和矿务局负责召开的定期的基本建设平衡会议，已证明是加强各方面的配合协作和及时解决基本建设中各项问题的有效办法，今后必须继续作好这一工作。第二，必须加强地质勘探工作和设计工作，这是煤炭工业建设的先行步骤。几年来煤炭工业的地质勘探和设计力量都有很大发展，作了不少的工作。但目前仍远远不能满足煤矿基本建设的需要，地质勘探工作落后于设计，设计工作落后于施工的严重局面仍未改变。为了改变这种状况，就要以最大努力加速地质勘探，以求在两三年内彻底扭转地质落后于建井的局面。同时也要加强设计工作的思想教育，提高设计人员的责任感，改进设计生产的组织管理工作，提高设计质量和工作效率，以缩短设计时间。第三，必须用一切力量做好施工前的准备工作，做好器材设备的供应工作，积极提高管理水平和技术水平，提高劳动生产率，保证限额以上工程、特别井建工程按期开工，按期或提前竣工投入生产，以达到五年计划中规定增加的生产能力。
    充分利用现有矿山资源，促进煤炭工业生产的增长，这是有迫切意义的。从一九五○年到现在，煤炭工业共恢复矿井七十七处，改建矿井一百一十四处，提高生产能力四千八百余万吨，同时推行了新采法，回采率提高了一倍以上，煤矿机械化水平也大大提高了。但是，目前煤矿生产上存在的问题还很多。一九五五年上半年国营煤矿产量任务虽已完成计划，而总产值、劳动效率、财务却都没有完成计划。就是在产量方面，全国国营煤矿中也还有百分之三十九点五的生产单位没有完成计划。至于正规作业不好、生产循环计划不能完成、机械利用率低、设备损坏率高、事故多、煤质差的现象，更是普遍。这些缺点和错误，大大地妨碍了煤炭生产水平的提高。要改变这种状况，今后必须继续进行全面生产改革，以苏联的新的技术成就来逐步改造旧有矿井的生产过程和运输过程的技术设备，逐渐做到按采煤程序进行开采，以发挥其潜力。同时要推行正规循环作业，加速采煤和掘进的进度，继续加强矿井地质、掘进与采煤的平衡工作，加强安全工作，提高机械利用率，认真推广阜新平安一米层的经验。为此，就要不断地改善和提高煤矿企业的管理水平，掌握组织均衡生产的方法，厉行严格的节约制度，以便逐旬逐月的安全地全面地完成国家计划。
    加速基本建设的进度和进一步提高生产，都必须依靠群众，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，广泛展开劳动竞赛。不久以前，煤矿工会第二届全国代表大会对此曾作了专门讨论，全体煤矿职工都应该坚决响应代表大会的号召。同时，各级煤矿工会也应该改进工作作风，加强具体领导，克服劳动竞赛中的形式主义倾向，深入地帮助落后工人和落后单位。在组织劳动竞赛中，学习和推广施玉海、刘九学的安全生产经验，马六孩、崔国山、李宝书的快速掘进经验，谷发明的深孔爆破经验以及建井平行作业等等经验，具有重要的意义。因为认真地学习和推广这些先进经验，不仅可以使落后的赶上先进的，有效地提高劳动生产率；也可以使工会工作具体化，使各级工会的干部密切联系群众，克服官僚主义的作风，以便领导全体职工积极地完成和超额完成国家的计划。
    在全体煤矿职工们的努力下，煤炭工业已经胜利完成了五年计划前两年的任务。今后三年的任务是艰巨的，还必须继续努力。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，只要全体煤矿职工不断地提高自己的政治觉悟和技术水平，克服困难，争取完成和超额完成煤矿工业的第一个五年计划是完全可能的。
