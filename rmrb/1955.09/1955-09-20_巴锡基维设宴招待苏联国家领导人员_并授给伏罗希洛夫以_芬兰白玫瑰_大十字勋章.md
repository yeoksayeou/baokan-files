Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 19th: According to TASS, Finnish President Paasikivi held a banquet at the Finnish Embassy in Moscow on the 18th to entertain Soviet state leaders.

    Those attending the banquet were: Bulganin, Voroshilov, Malenkov, Kaganovich, Pervukhin, Saburov, Suslov, and Khrushchev.

    Also attending the banquet from the Soviet side were: Soviet Ministers Bakayev, Valaksin, Kabanov, and Nosenko.

    Those attending the banquet from the Finnish side were: Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen, Defense Minister Skog, Minister Svento, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Seppälä, and Finnish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Wöri.

    During the banquet, Paasikivi awarded Voroshilov the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland with a golden chain (the highest order of Finland specifically awarded to heads of state).

    In his speech, Paasikivi said that the Soviet government's initiative to renounce its lease rights to the Porkkala-Udd area will be welcomed by Finland with great joy. I believe that this noble act is a new and convincing demonstration of the Soviet Union's desire for peace, not only towards its neighbor Finland but also on a global scale.

    Referring to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union, Paasikivi said: This treaty was signed between two independent countries without any threat from the Soviet side, and it has been the main basis for the development of relations between our two countries in recent years. The atmosphere created by this treaty itself is an important prerequisite for the development of peaceful mutual ties between our two peoples. Since the Soviet government has proposed extending the validity of this Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance beyond 1958, the Finnish delegation has agreed to this proposal.

    Paasikivi continued: During these days, the correctness of the principle I have adhered to for such a long time has once again been confirmed. The content of this principle is: When we Finns and you Soviets jointly resolve disputes, the pen is a better weapon than the gun. I would also like to say that when resolving problems between other countries, the pen will probably produce better results than the gun. At least that is the case when resolving issues between Finland and the Soviet Union.

    In conclusion, Paasikivi said, Now I am honored to award you, Mr. Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the highest order of our country to express our sincere respect for your activities as a leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. A year ago, I had the honor of receiving the highest award of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin. I believe that these two orders will historically become evidence of the friendly neighborly relations between our two peoples, a relationship that will be further consolidated by our talks this time.

    In his acceptance speech after receiving the award, Voroshilov said: Your visit here, our talks with you, Mr. Prime Minister, and other Finnish statesmen, are the result of the development of our post-war relations and the result of the correct mutual relations between our two peoples and countries. This is an attempt to find more effective and necessary measures to improve the friendly relations between our two peoples.

    I can assure you, Mr. President and your esteemed colleagues, that our people will be very pleased to see such good results from our negotiations. I think the Finnish people will also welcome these results.

    Finally, Voroshilov thanked President Paasikivi for awarding him this high honor on behalf of the Soviet government, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people.

    Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin and Prime Minister of the Republic of Finland Kekkonen also spoke at the banquet.

    巴锡基维设宴招待苏联国家领导人员
    并授给伏罗希洛夫以“芬兰白玫瑰”大十字勋章
    据新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：芬兰共和国总统巴锡基维十八日在莫斯科芬兰大使馆举行宴会，招待苏联国家领导人员。
    出席宴会的有：布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫。
    苏联方面出席宴会的还有：苏联部长巴卡耶夫、瓦拉克辛、卡巴诺夫、诺森科等人。
    芬兰方面出席宴会的有：芬兰总理吉科宁、国防部长斯科格、部长斯汶托、外交部国务秘书塞帕拉和芬兰驻苏联大使沃里等。
    席间，巴锡基维授给伏罗希洛夫一枚带金链的“芬兰白玫瑰”大十字勋章（这是芬兰共和国专门授予国家领袖的最高勋章）。
    巴锡基维致词说，苏联政府主动采取的、放弃自己的波卡拉乌德地区租借权利这样一个步骤，将受到芬兰满心高兴的欢迎。我认为，这种崇高的行为是苏联不仅对自己的邻国芬兰的、而且是在世界范围内的和平愿望的一个新的、令人信服的证明。
    巴锡基维在谈到芬苏友好合作互助条约时说：这个条约是在两个自主国之间，在没有受到苏联方面的威胁的情况下签订的，它曾经是这几年中我们两国之间的关系发展的主要基础。这个条约所造成的气氛本身，是发展我们两国人民之间的和平的相互联系的重要的先决条件。既然苏联政府建议把这个友好合作互助条约的有效期限延长到一九五八年以后，芬兰代表团同意这个建议。
    巴锡基维接着说：在这些日子中，我在如此长的时期中所坚持的那个原则的正确性又一次得到了证实。这一原则的内容是：当我们芬兰人和你们苏联人共同解决争执问题的时候，笔杆是比枪杆更好的武器。我还愿意说，在其他国家之间解决问题的时候，笔杆大概也会比枪杆产生较好的结果。至少在解决芬苏两国之间的问题时，情况就是这样的。
    巴锡基维最后说，现在我荣幸地把我国的最高勋章授给你，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席先生，以表示我们对你作为苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的一个领导者的活动的衷心敬意。一年前，我曾经荣幸地获得了苏联的最高勋章——列宁勋章。我相信，这两个勋章在历史上将成为我们两国人民友好的睦邻关系的证据，这种关系由于我们这次的会谈将获得更加巩固的基础。
    伏罗希洛夫在接受勋章后致答词说：你们的来到这里，我们同你、同总理先生和芬兰国家的其他政治家的会谈，是我们战后关系发展的结果，是我们两国人民和国家正确的相互关系的结果。这是我们想要找到更加有效、更加必要的措施以改善我们两国人民之间的友好关系的一种尝试。
    我可以向你保证，总统先生和你的敬爱的同事们，我国人民将十分高兴地看到我们的谈判产生这样良好的成果。我想，芬兰人民也将欢迎这些成果。
    伏罗希洛夫最后代表苏联政府、苏联共产党和苏联人民感谢巴锡基维总统授予他的崇高的荣誉。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和芬兰共和国总理吉科宁也在宴会上讲了话。
