Editorial: Vigorously Publicize the Two Measures for Grain Work

　　The work and life of each of us are closely related to the socialist construction of the entire country. This is most vividly manifested in the grain issue. In order to adapt grain production to the needs for it, and to smoothly carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation, we must, in addition to striving to develop agricultural production and promote the agricultural cooperative movement, also make appropriate adjustments from the grain distribution side. The “Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas” and the “Provisional Measures for the Rationed Supply of Grain in Cities and Towns” are two important measures for regulating grain distribution. In the process of improving grain work in accordance with these two measures, all localities should universally and vigorously publicize them to the broad masses of urban and rural people, so that people can fully understand the close relationship between the implementation of these two measures and the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, so that people can actively and voluntarily support the implementation of these two measures; and so that the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of urban and rural people can be greatly enhanced, and use full enthusiasm to further promote the socialist upsurge.

　　What should all localities vigorously publicize?

　　First of all, we must further deepen the idea that consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is the guarantee for completing socialist construction, and enable the urban and rural people to fully understand that these two measures are effective measures for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Not only should the importance of implementing the grain rationed supply system in cities and towns be known to every household in cities and towns; but also the rural people should understand this measure, and understand that the urban people are using this method to compress unreasonable grain supplies, and are striving to save grain, in order to ensure that the state's grain purchase figures from farmers can be reasonably reduced and stabilized. Not only should the importance of fixing grain production, purchase, and sales, down to the household, be known to every household in rural areas; but also urban people should understand that the implementation of fixed grain production, purchase, and sales has great significance for the worker-peasant alliance and agricultural production increase, and understand the necessity of reducing and stabilizing the state’s grain purchase figures from farmers within a certain period, and the necessity of strictly implementing rationed supply in cities.

　　All localities should use local practical examples to tell the urban and rural people, so that they can understand each other's new achievements in increasing production and saving grain after the improvement of grain work. In the previous period, when cities implemented grain supply verification by household, grain sales had already decreased significantly. For example, Shanghai's grain sales in July this year decreased by 20.24 percent compared to April, and the grain saved compared to May was enough for 2 million people to eat for a month. This is a clear example. From this, it can be seen that after the implementation of the grain rationed supply system, those unreasonable grain supplies in the past will inevitably decrease, and reasonable sales will be stabilized; moreover, it is precisely because the working class and urban people actively save grain and support the rationed supply system that the rural grain production, purchase, and sales can be implemented, and the state's grain purchase figures from farmers can be reduced and stabilized. Now, in some provinces, due to the fact that rural grain production, purchase, and sales have been fixed down to the household, the production enthusiasm of farmers has greatly increased. Nineteen agricultural cooperatives in Huaichang Township, Dongyang County, Zhejiang, revised their production plans under the encouragement of the "three fix" policy, guaranteeing an excess production increase of 200,300 catties of grain; farmers in Lingxia Township, Jinhua County, bought 280 pigs and 48 head of cattle in just a few days after the "three fixes" were implemented down to the household. If the whole country does this, it will make the grain needed by urban people and industrial production more reliably guaranteed.

　　We must also make the urban and rural people understand more clearly: to fundamentally solve the grain problem, and to further improve our lives, we must also practice thrift in all aspects, concentrate our main efforts on giving priority to the development of our country's heavy industry, and create the basic conditions for agricultural mechanization; and now we should actively lead farmers to carry out the agricultural cooperative movement, and create the basic conditions for using modern agricultural technology and equipment and further developing agricultural production with collective strength. We must make the urban and rural people understand more clearly: developing agricultural production is the prerequisite for ensuring industrial development and the full realization of the First Five-Year Plan, and we must work together to prevent and overcome the phenomenon of agriculture not adapting to industrial development. Farmers should fully utilize the existing conditions to strive to increase production and ensure the completion of the state's production and unified purchase tasks for grain and industrial raw materials, which is the greatest support for industrial construction. In addition to supporting farmers with the development of industrial production, urban people should try their best to save grain and reduce unnecessary supplies, so that the state can reduce grain purchase quantities, in order to improve farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

　　Secondly, we must further deepen the concept that obeying the state plan is the greatest interest of the people of the whole country. Everyone should understand the benefits and necessity of these two provisional measures, understand the specific content of these two measures, and know what they should do, so that everyone's questions can be answered correctly and clearly. Everyone should understand that the specific provisions in these measures reasonably and appropriately take care of the needs of various people, and the government treats grain work with a consistently responsible attitude towards the people. Everyone should understand that everyone's life is closely related to the cause of socialist construction, and the possible minor "inconveniences" in individual immediate lives will be exchanged for the great convenience of ensuring the grain supply for the people of the whole country, not being afraid of disasters, and not being afraid of other unexpected events, so that the beautiful and happy future of the people of the whole country is guaranteed.

　　There are many examples that can be used to illustrate this issue. For example, Guangdong Province suffered a drought in 1943 before liberation, and more than 3 million people starved to death in the province; this spring, the severity of the drought far exceeded that of 1943, and some areas suffered other disasters in succession, but the province's prices and grain prices were completely stable, and the grain supply was completely guaranteed; with the support of the working class, the farmers overcame the difficulties caused by the severe drought, and also made the early rice harvest normal. This is precisely the result of everyone obeying the state plan and supporting the policy of unified purchase and sale. Qi Jiuchu, a housewife in Tianjin, pays attention to saving grain, buys grain according to plan, eats as much as she used to, and saves four yuan a month on buying grain; her family could only save 24 yuan in the bank every year, but in the future, they can save 72 yuan a year. Obviously, this is beneficial to both the country and herself. From a broader perspective, if the people of the whole country obey the state plan and promote the cause of socialism in this way, the future benefits will be even greater. Farmers should pay special attention to explaining: after the implementation of fixed grain production, purchase, and sales, they have more grain left in their hands than in the past, and they should make good arrangements for long-term household management, and in addition to normal consumption, they should use grain for developing production and appropriate storage in a planned way, and should not waste it. Grain-deficient households should pay more attention to saving, strictly buy grain according to the assessed time and quantity, and do not disrupt and break through the state's supply plan. Organs, groups, factories, and schools must, without exception, become models of implementing the state plan and saving grain.

　　Finally, we must break the misunderstanding of some people about our grain work, and we must resolutely combat the rumors and sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries against grain work. Some people have taken a negative attitude towards the policy of unified purchase and sale, intentionally or unintentionally, using some shortcomings that inevitably occurred when the unified purchase and sale was first implemented. We must criticize this erroneous view with conclusive facts. Some people do not understand that the rationed supply of grain in cities and towns and the fixed production, purchase, and sale of grain in rural areas are further concretizations of the unified purchase and sale, and mistakenly believe that the policy of unified purchase and sale has changed. We must give a clear answer to this misunderstanding. The masses should understand that the implementation of the two measures for grain work is precisely to adhere to the policy of unified purchase and sale. Every patriotic and law-abiding citizen should use positive practical actions to safeguard the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. As for the counter-revolutionaries who spread rumors saying, "The implementation of grain rationed supply is because too much grain is exported," this must be exposed. Although the country's grain exports in 1954 were more than any year since liberation, it only exported 3.5 billion catties, and more than half of it was soybeans. This number is not much more than before liberation, and it does not have a great impact on our country's grain supply. For the sake of national industrialization and to exchange for a large amount of machinery and equipment, these small amounts of grain exports are necessary. Counter-revolutionaries also create a rumor saying, "After the implementation of grain 'three fixes,' even if there is a disaster, you have to sell grain according to the fixed number." In fact, the Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain have long stipulated that in the event of a disaster, the amount of purchase will be reduced or exempted according to the severity of the disaster; and grain-surplus households that are short of grain due to disaster will also be guaranteed supply. All rumors must be resolutely exposed.

　　It should be seen that changing the habits of millions of people is the most difficult task. Therefore, in implementing the two measures on grain work, on the one hand, we must do a good job of organizational preparation and material preparation, and on the other hand, we must use strong political work to do a good job of ideological preparation among the masses; and with the progress of practical work and the changes in the thinking of the masses, we must also have continuous strengthening and deepening political work closely coordinated. When local Party committees deploy grain work, they should also deploy propaganda work at the same time. We must make a comprehensive arrangement of various propaganda forces and form a strong propaganda team. On the one hand, use the propaganda team and propaganda weapons to promote work; on the other hand, further improve the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people through the improvement of grain work. From the second half of 1953 to 1954, all parts of the country, in conjunction with the unified purchase and sale of grain and other work, vigorously publicized the Party's general line in the transition period to the urban and rural people, especially to the farmers, and achieved great results and valuable experience. We should fully use and develop the existing experience, strengthen propaganda work in improving grain work, and make better and greater achievements.

### 大张旗鼓地宣传粮食工作的两项办法

    大张旗鼓地宣传粮食工作的两项办法
    我们每个人的工作和生活，都同整个国家的社会主义建设有密切的关系。这在粮食问题上最鲜明地表现了出来。为了使粮食的生产和对它的需要相适应，为了顺利地进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，我们除了尽力发展农业生产、推进农业合作化运动以外，还必须从粮食的分配方面加以适当的调节。“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”正是调节粮食分配的两项重要办法。各地在按照这两个办法改进粮食工作的过程中，应当普遍地大张旗鼓地向广大城乡人民进行宣传，使人们充分了解实施这两个办法同社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的密切关系，使人们积极地主动地支持这两个办法的实施；使广大城乡人民的社会主义觉悟大大提高一步，用饱满的热情进一步推动社会主义的高潮。
    各地应该大张旗鼓地宣传些什么呢？
    首先，应当使巩固工农联盟是完成社会主义建设的保证这个思想进一步深入人心，使城乡人民完全懂得这两个办法是巩固工农联盟的有效措施。不但要使市镇人民对于市镇实行粮食定量供应办法的重要意义家喻户晓；也应当使农村人民了解这个办法，了解市镇人民正在用这种办法压缩不合理的粮食供应，正在力求节约粮食，以保证国家向农民购粮的数字能够合理地减少和稳定。不但要使农村人民对于粮食定产、定购、定销一直定到户的重要意义和它的办法家喻户晓；也应当使城市人民了解实行粮食定产、定购、定销对于工农联盟和农业增产有重大的意义，了解在一定时期内减少并稳定向农民购粮数字的必要性，和在城市严格地实行定量供应的必要性。
    各地应该用当地的实际例子告诉城乡人民，使他们互相了解改进粮食工作以后增产节约粮食的新成绩。在前一个时期城市实行粮食按户核实供应的时候，粮食销售量就已经减少了许多。比如，上海市今年七月份销售的粮食比四月份减少了百分之二十点二四，比五月份少销的粮食足够二百万人吃一个月。这就是一个明显的例子。由此可见，实行了粮食定量供应办法以后，从前那些不合理的粮食供应必然减少，使合理的销量稳定下来；而且，正是因为工人阶级和城市人民这样积极地节约粮食，支持定量供应办法，才使农村的粮食定产、定购、定销能够贯彻实行，国家向农民购粮的数字能够减少和稳定下来。现在某些省份由于农村粮食定产、定购、定销已经定到户，农民的生产积极性大为高涨。浙江东阳县槐堂乡的十九个农业合作社，在“三定”政策鼓舞下修订了生产计划，保证超额增产二十万零三百多斤粮食；金华县岭下乡的农民，在“三定”到户以后，不多天就买进了二百八十只猪、四十八只耕牛。全国都这样做，就会使城市人民和工业生产所需要的粮食得到更加可靠的保证。
    我们还要使城乡人民都更清楚地了解：要从根本上解决粮食问题，要更多地改善我们的生活，还必须从各方面厉行节约，集中主要力量优先发展我国的重工业，创造农业机械化的基本条件；而现在就应该积极地领导农民开展农业合作化运动，创造使用现代的农业技术装备和用集体的力量进一步发展农业生产的基本条件。要使城乡人民更清楚地了解：发展农业生产是保证工业发展和全部实现第一个五年计划的前提，必须一致努力防止和克服农业同工业发展不适应的现象。农民充分运用现有的条件努力增产，保证完成国家粮食和工业原料的生产和统购任务，这就是对工业建设的最大的支援。城市人民除了以发展工业生产支援农民之外，就要尽量地节约粮食、减少不必要的供应，使国家得以减少购粮数量，以提高农民的增产积极性，进一步巩固工农联盟。
    其次，应当使服从国家计划是全国人民的最大利益的观念进一步深入人心。应当使人人都能了解这两个暂行办法的好处和必要，了解这两个办法的具体内容，并且知道自己应该怎么做，使每个人的疑问都得到正确的明白的答复。应当使大家了解，这些办法中的具体规定是合情合理地照顾了各种人的需要，政府是以一贯对人民负责的态度对待粮食工作的。应当使大家了解，每个人的生活同社会主义建设事业都有密切的关系，个人眼前生活上可能有些微的“不方便”，这将换得全国人民粮食供应有保证、不怕灾荒、不怕其他意外事变的大方便，使全国人民美好幸福的前途有了保证。
    在这个问题上有许多事例可以加以说明。比如，广东省在解放前的一九四三年遭遇了旱灾，全省饿死了三百多万人；今年春天旱情严重的程度远远超过一九四三年，有些地区又连续遭受其他灾害，但全省物价粮价完全稳定，粮食供应完全有保证；农民们在工人阶级的支持下，排除严重旱灾造成的困难，还使早稻获得常年的收成。这正是大家服从国家计划、支持统购统销政策得到的结果。天津市家庭妇女齐九初注意节约粮食，按照计划买粮，同过去一样吃得饱，每月还节约了四元买粮食的钱；她家本来每年只能在银行储蓄二十四元，今后一年可储蓄七十二元。很显然，这对国家对自己都有好处。从大处看，全国人民都这样服从国家计划，推进社会主义事业，将来的好处就更大了。对农民应当特别注意说明：实行粮食定产、定购、定销以后，留在自己手里的粮食比过去多了，应当很好地安排长时期的家计，除了正常的消费以外，要把粮食有计划地用于发展生产和适当地储存，不可浪费。缺粮户更要注意节约，严格按照评定的时间和数量买粮，不要打乱和突破国家的供应计划。机关、团体、工厂、学校必须毫无例外地成为执行国家计划和节约粮食的模范。
    最后，必须打破一部分人对于我们的粮食工作的误解，并且要坚决打击反革命分子对粮食工作的造谣破坏活动。有人利用统购统销刚实行的时候难免发生的一些缺点，有意无意地对统购统销政策采取了否定的态度。必须用确凿的事实对这种错误的看法加以批判。有人不了解市镇粮食定量供应和农村粮食定产、定购、定销是统购统销的进一步具体化，误以为是统购统销政策变了。必须给这种误解以明确的回答。应当使群众了解：实行粮食工作的两个办法正是为了坚持统购统销政策。每一个爱国守法的公民都应当用积极的实际行动来维护粮食统购统销政策。至于反革命分子造谣说：“实行粮食定量供应是因为粮食出口太多了”，这是必须加以揭穿的。一九五四年国家出口粮食虽然是解放以来比较多的一年，但也只不过出口了三十五亿斤，而且半数以上是大豆。这个数目并不比解放以前增加很多，这对我国的粮食供应并没有大影响。为了国家工业化，为了换取大量机器装备，这些少量的粮食出口是必要的。反革命分子还制造一种谣言说：“实行粮食‘三定’以后，遇到灾荒也得按定下来的数目卖粮。”其实，在粮食统购统销暂行办法中早有明文规定：遇有灾荒是要按照灾情轻重，少购或免购的；余粮户因灾缺粮，也要保证供应。一切谣言都是必须坚决揭穿的。
    应该看到，改变千百万人的习惯是最困难的工作。因此，在贯彻实行关于粮食工作的两项办法的时候，一方面必须做好组织准备和物质准备，一方面必须运用强有力的政治工作在群众中作好思想准备；而且随着实际工作的进展和群众思想的变化，还必须有不断加强不断深入的政治工作紧紧地配合。各地党委在布置粮食工作的时候，应当同时把宣传工作布置好。要把各种宣传的力量加以通盘的安排，组成强大的宣传队伍。一方面运用宣传队伍和宣传武器推动工作；一方面通过粮食工作的改进而进一步提高广大人民群众的社会主义觉悟。一九五三年下半年到一九五四年，全国各地结合粮食统购统销工作和其他工作，大张旗鼓地向城乡人民、特别是向农民宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线，得到了巨大的成绩和可贵的经验。我们应当充分地运用和发展已有的经验，在改进粮食工作中加强宣传工作，做出更好更大的成绩来。
