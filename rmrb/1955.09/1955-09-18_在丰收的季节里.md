    In the Season of Harvest

    On the Chengdu Plain, crisscrossed by ditches and canals, is now a golden "sea of rice." The abundant new rice is about to be harvested.

    A reporter took a train from Chengdu. After the train passed Jianyang Station, the area east of Jianyang became mountainous. Many of the originally bare mountain slopes are now covered with thriving corn and sorghum. Terraced fields are filled with rice paddies.

    As the train passed the banks of the Tuo River, farmers were busy with the autumn harvest. The sounds of threshing and mountain songs echoed from before and behind the mountains. Beside each threshing floor and threshing machine, many people were working diligently. Teams of children, forming gleaning squads, turned over the threshed rice stalks, picking up scattered grains. Cadres, students, and residents from the towns came to the fields to help with the autumn harvest. This year, due to the increased use of improved threshing machines and the improved harvesting tools and techniques along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway line, some townships are able to reduce grain loss by 20,000 to 50,000 jin.

    Our train arrived at Longchang Station. Five or six farmers boarded the train. They said they had already walked thirty li and were taking this train to a place eighty li away. Tomorrow morning, they would carry back the buckwheat and potato seeds they had ordered, as the members of the agricultural production cooperative were waiting to plant them. One of them said, "The dry dam field behind my house, which used to yield little to nothing nine years out of ten, produced four baskets and one hamper this year!" Another said, "The rice ears are nine inches long, with four hundred and several dozen grains each, doubling the yield compared to previous years. Without joining the cooperative, without the train bringing in water pumps and chemical fertilizers, how could we have such a harvest?"

    Currently, the countryside is busy with the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. Along the railway line, one can often see scenes like this: threshing in front, plowing behind; threshing in one field, transplanting seedlings in the next. In the already harvested rice fields, regenerated rice is growing, and people are busy applying fertilizer. Farmers in Longchang, Jiangjin, and other counties have planted double-cropping rice, and the seedlings have already formed a canopy. The sweet potatoes on the slopes have grown so large that they have cracked the soil, while in the rice fields in the mountain valleys below, where the rice has just been harvested, women are draining the fields and planting autumn sweet potatoes. In many places, corn and sorghum have just been harvested, and buckwheat and potatoes have already been planted. Radishes, greens, and other vegetables planted early in the Jiangjin area have already sprouted green leaves. The farmers are striving to realize the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee's call to increase the province's total grain production by another 300 to 500 million jin. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在丰收的季节里
    在沟渠交错的成都平原上，现在是一片金黄色的“稻海”。丰硕的新稻就要收割了。
    记者乘火车从成都出发。列车经过了简阳站，简阳以东都是山地。许多原来光秃秃的山坡上，都长着茁壮的玉米、高粱。一湾湾的梯田里，长着稻谷。
    列车经过沱江岸边时，农民正在秋收。山前山后，不断传出挞谷声和山歌。每架挞斗、每架打谷机旁，都有许多人在忙碌着。少年儿童组成的拣粮队在翻着挞过的稻束，拣回抛撒的谷穗。市镇里的干部、学生和居民来到田间帮助秋收。今年成渝铁路线上的农民由于采用改良打谷机的增多，又改进收割工具、技术，有的乡可以减少粮食抛撒两万斤到五万斤。
    我们的列车到了隆昌车站，五、六个农民上了车。他们说，已经走了三十里路，要搭这趟车到八十里外的一个地方去，明早还要从那里挑回订购的荞麦、马铃薯种籽，农业生产合作社的社员们在等着下种。他们中的一个说：“我屋后那块十年九不收的干坝子田，今年也打了四挑零一箩！”又一个说：“九寸长的谷穗，一吊四百几十颗，比往年涨了一倍。不进社，火车不运来抽水机和化学肥料，那有这样收成？”
    目前农村里正忙着进行秋收、秋耕、秋种。在铁路沿线时常可以看到这样的景象：前面挞谷，后面跟着在犁田；上一块田挞谷，下一块田薅秧。在已收割的稻田里，再生稻已经长起来，人们正忙着追肥。隆昌、江津等县农民，种上了双季稻，现在秧苗已经封林。坡上甘薯已长得把泥土胀裂开了，而坡下山沟刚收割的稻田里，妇女们正放干田水，栽种秋甘薯。在许多地方，玉米和高粱刚刚收割，荞麦、马铃薯已经种上了。江津一带种得早的萝卜、青菜等，已长出绿叶。农民们正努力实现四川省人民委员会发出的全省再增产三亿到五亿斤原粮的号召。（新华社）
