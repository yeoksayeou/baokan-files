    Taiyuan Chemical Plant and Taiyuan Printing Factory Successfully Experiment with Plastic to Replace Lead Spacers
    Technical personnel from the local state-owned Taiyuan Chemical Plant and Taiyuan Printing Factory, learning from advanced Soviet experience, recently succeeded in experimenting with No. 305 bakelite powder plastic material to replace lead in the manufacture of printing lead spacers.
    Using plastic instead of lead spacers can save valuable non-ferrous metals, and the cost is also lower than using lead. At the same time, plastic is more wear-resistant than lead, has strong insulation, and is lightweight. Workers find it easier to operate and will not contract chronic lead poisoning, an occupational disease. (Guo Runsheng)

    太原化学厂和太原印刷厂用塑料代替铅空试验成功
    地方国营太原化学厂和太原印刷厂的技术人员，学习苏联先进经验，最近试用三零五号电木粉塑胶材料代替用铅制造的印刷铅空获得成功。
    用塑料代替铅空，可以节省价值昂贵的有色金属，成本也比用铅低。同时，塑料比铅耐磨，绝缘性强，重量轻。工人操作时轻便，而且不会得慢性中铅毒的职业病。　（郭润生）
