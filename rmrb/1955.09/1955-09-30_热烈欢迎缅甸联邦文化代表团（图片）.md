    Warmly Welcome the Cultural Delegation of the Union of Burma

    The Cultural Delegation of the Union of Burma held its opening ceremony for its performance tour in our country at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing on the afternoon of the 28th. The wonderful performances by the Burmese artists were warmly welcomed by the Beijing audience, with nearly half of the performances being repeated once or twice.
