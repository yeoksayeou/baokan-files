Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 31st: The 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union discussed the issue of "immigration and emigration policies in the allocation of labor and the prevention of unemployment" at its morning session on August 31st. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Iraq, Italy, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Sudan, Israel, Austria, and Lebanon spoke during the discussion.

Then, the conference voted on the draft resolutions of the issues that had already been discussed. The first vote was on the resolution regarding the development of international economic relations. This resolution had been amended, and the amended resolution was adopted unanimously. The resolution on cultural exchange among countries and the resolution on the free movement of people were adopted unanimously without modification.

At the evening session on the 30th, new members of the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union were elected. The Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union had discussed this issue and decided to recommend to the conference the election of the following individuals as members of the Executive Committee: Mr. Hilgert (Finland), Mr. Mikhailov (Soviet Union), Mr. Pijannelli (Italy), Mr. Sinnatamby Rajaratnam (Ceylon), and Mr. Mulla (Iraq).

As a result of the secret ballot, all nominated candidates were elected by an overwhelming majority.

After a speech by the chairman of the conference, Mr. Hilgert, the 44th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union was declared closed.

Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki: The Inter-Parliamentary Union concluded its discussions on the development of international economic and cultural relations and the powers of the speakers of national parliaments at its afternoon and evening sessions on August 30th.

Romanian representative Lupu emphasized in his speech that economic cooperation among countries and peoples always contributes to the consolidation of political ties. He said that more and more people in the world support the development of broad economic ties among peoples. He called for the elimination of all obstacles to free international economic relations.

Soviet representative Safronov said in his speech that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated expanding trade with all countries. Safronov pointed out that restrictions on trade are a product of the "Cold War." Such restrictions have damaged traditional economic relations between many countries and are an important cause of the deterioration and increased mistrust in international relations. He said: We oppose discriminatory policies because they are incompatible with the principles of good neighborliness, peaceful coexistence, and equality.

Safronov concluded by saying that the Soviet parliamentary delegation supports the proposal to strengthen international economic exchange put forward at the meeting, and especially favors holding an international economic conference as soon as possible.

Polish representative Ranki said that one of the tasks of peaceful coexistence is to eliminate obstacles to free trade.

The conference then discussed the last of the main issues—international cultural exchange and freedom of movement.

U.S. representative Porter argued that in carrying out cultural exchanges, one country should not force another country to accept its culture, but should carry out cultural exchanges based on the principle of mutual enrichment of different cultures.

Representatives from Hungary and Romania pointed out in their speeches the great significance of cultural exchange for world peace.

British representative Furness noted with satisfaction the increasing number of travelers visiting the Soviet Union.

Soviet representative Kairlov said that the Soviet Union has always supported the expansion of cultural ties between countries and the elimination of obstacles hindering the development of international relations. He said that in the past two years alone, more than 2,300 delegations from various countries have visited the Soviet Union, and in the past two months alone, 395 delegations from 61 countries have visited the Soviet agricultural exhibition. This fact completely bankrupts the absurd claim that there is an "iron curtain" in the Soviet Union. Kairlov also spoke of the increasingly frequent visits of Soviet cultural and scientific workers to foreign countries and the exchange of experiences between scientists from various countries, which can promote scientific development. He concluded by saying that the Soviet parliamentary delegation supports the recommendations of the Cultural Relations Committee.

After speeches by representatives from Sweden and the United Kingdom, the discussion on international cultural exchange and freedom of movement came to an end.

The conference began discussing the next item on the agenda—the powers of the speaker—and concluded the discussion of this item at the evening session. Dutch representative Van Stokwigen gave a report on this issue.

Soviet representative Rashidov said in his speech during the discussion that the issue of the powers of the speaker of parliament is a matter for the parliaments of each country themselves, and should be resolved within each country in accordance with the country's inherent historical conditions and traditions.

This issue has no international significance, and therefore, there is no need for the conference to adopt any recommendations on the issue under discussion.

Reporter Van Stokwigen agreed with Rashidov's opinion that each parliament should decide for itself the position of its speaker.

The discussion on this issue came to an end here.

Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki: The Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held a meeting on the 30th to discuss the election of new members to the Executive Committee to replace the retiring representatives from Sweden, Turkey, and Lebanon. After lengthy discussions, the Council decided to recommend to the Union conference the election of the following individuals as members of the Executive Committee: Mr. Hilgert (Finland), Mr. Pijannelli (Italy), Mr. Mikhailov (Soviet Union), Mr. Mulla (Iraq), and Mr. Sinnatamby Rajaratnam (Ceylon). Candidate Hilgert was nominated by the Soviet Union and several Scandinavian countries.

At the conclusion of the Council meeting, Soviet representative Mikhailov spoke. He said that the Council had not yet responded to the letter from the head of the People's Republic of China's delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union regarding the admission of the delegation as a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. However, discussion on this issue had not yet begun.

    各国议会联盟四十四届大会闭幕
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基三十一日讯：各国议会联盟大会八月三十一日上午会议讨论了“在分配劳动力和防止失业现象方面的入境出境侨民政策”问题。在讨论这个问题时发言的有苏联、伊拉克、意大利、巴西、英国、苏丹、以色列、奥地利和黎巴嫩的代表。
    然后会议就已经讨论完毕的各项问题的决议案进行表决。首先表决的是关于发展国际经济关系问题的决议案。这项决议案已经作了一些修改，修改后的决议案获得一致通过。关于各国文化交流的决议案和关于人们自由往来的决议案未经修改得到一致通过。
    三十日晚间会议选举了各国议会联盟执行委员会的新委员，各国议会联盟理事会曾就这个问题进行了讨论，决定建议大会选举下列几人为执行委员会委员：希尔加斯（芬兰）、米哈依洛夫（苏联）、皮詹奈利（意大利）、沈纳那雅克（锡兰）和穆拉（伊拉克）。
    秘密投票结果，所有被提名的候选人都以绝大多数选票当选。
    在大会主席希尔加斯致词后，各国议会联盟第四十四届大会宣告闭幕。
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：各国议会联盟八月三十日下午和晚间会议上结束了关于发展国际经济和文化关系问题和各国议会议长权力问题的讨论。
    罗马尼亚代表卢普在发言中着重指出，各国人民和各国之间的经济合作总是有助于政治联系的巩固的。他说，世界上拥护发展各国人民之间的广泛经济联系的人越来越多。他号召消除国际自由经济联系的一切障碍。
      苏联代表萨夫罗诺夫发言说，苏联一贯主张同所有国家扩大贸易。萨夫罗诺夫指出，对贸易实行的限制，是“冷战”的产物。这类限制破坏了许多国家之间传统的经济关系，而且是国际关系的恶化和不信任加剧的重要原因。他说：我们反对歧视政策，因为这种政策是同善邻关系、和平共处和彼此平等的原则不相容的。
      萨夫罗诺夫最后表示苏联议员团代表团支持会上提出的加强国际经济交流的提案，尤其赞成尽快举行国际经济会议。
    波兰代表兰基说，和平共处的任务之一就是消除自由贸易道路上的障碍。
    会议接着讨论主要问题中的最后一项——国际文化交流和来往自由。
    美国代表波特尔主张：在进行文化交流时，一个国家不得强使另一个国家接受其文化，而是根据不同的文化互相丰富的原则实行文化交流。
    匈牙利代表和罗马尼亚代表在发言中指出文化交流对世界和平的重大意义。
    英国代表弗尔纳斯满意地指出访问苏联的旅行家日益增多。
    苏联代表凯洛夫说，苏联过去和现在一向拥护扩大各国之间的文化联系，拥护消除阻挠国际关系发展的障碍。他说，仅仅在最近两年内就有各个国家的两千三百多个代表团访问了苏联，而在最近两个月以内，有六十一个国家的三百九十五个代表团参观了苏联农业展览会。这一事实使苏联存在所谓“铁幕”的这种无稽之谈完全破产了。凯洛夫还谈到苏联文化科学工作者日益频繁地到外国访问和各国科学家互相交换经验可以推进科学发展。他最后说，苏联议员团代表团支持文化联系委员会的建议。
    在瑞典和英国代表发言后，关于国际文化交流和来往自由问题的讨论即告结束。
    大会开始讨论下一议程——议长的权力问题，并且在晚间会议上结束了对这项议程的讨论。荷兰代表范斯托维根就这个问题作了报告。
    苏联代表拉希多夫在讨论时发言说，议会议长的权力问题是各国议会自己的问题，而且应当在各个国家内按照该国议会的固有历史条件和传统来解决。
    这个问题没有国际意义，因此，大会没有必要就讨论中的问题通过任何建议。
    报告人范斯托维根同意拉希多夫这项意见：各国议会应自行决定它的议长的地位。
    关于这个问题的讨论到此结束。
    新华社一日讯　塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：各国议会联盟理事会在三十日举行会议，讨论选举新的执行委员会委员代替已经退职的瑞典、土耳其和黎巴嫩的代表的问题。经过长时间的讨论后，理事会决定向联盟大会推荐选举下列的人为执行委员会委员：希尔加斯（芬兰）、皮詹奈利（意大利）、米哈依洛夫（苏联）、穆拉（伊拉克）和沈纳那亚克（锡兰）。候选人希尔加斯是由苏联和斯堪的那维亚几个国家提出来的。
    在理事会会议结束时，苏联代表米哈依洛夫讲了话。他说，理事会对于中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的人民代表团主席关于接纳代表团为各国议会联盟会员问题的来信还没有答复。可是关于这个问题并没有开始讨论。
