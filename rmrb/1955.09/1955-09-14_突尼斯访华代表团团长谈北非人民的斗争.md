Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. Aleya, head of the Tunisian Goodwill Delegation to China, who is currently visiting Shenyang, spoke to a reporter from this agency about the struggle of the Tunisian people and the people of Algeria and Morocco for national independence. He pointed out that the recent signing of the Franco-Tunisian autonomy agreement was only the first step in the Tunisian people's demand for the fulfillment of their national independence aspirations. He also said that the Tunisian people firmly support the struggle of their Algerian and Moroccan brothers for national rights and believe that this struggle is inseparable from their own.

Aleya condemned the recent bloody suppression of the Algerian and Moroccan people by the French colonialists, pointing out that this suppression could never thwart the just struggle of the Algerian and Moroccan people. He said that the French government should immediately negotiate with the representatives of the two countries on the condition of recognizing the national demands of the Algerian and Moroccan people.

Aleya said that the final communique adopted by the Asian-African Conference, which supports the rights of self-determination and independence of the North African people, encouraged the struggle of the North African people. He said that this made the North African people know that their struggle is not isolated. Supporting them is such a great force of the people of Asian and African countries, including the Chinese people.

Aleya said that, contrary to the people of Asian and African countries, the United States supports the French military operations to suppress the North African people. The United States supplies the French army with weapons and agrees that France can transfer French troops under the command of the NATO headquarters to reinforce the French army in North Africa. Aleya pointed out that American support for French rule in North Africa is nothing new. As early as May 1945, the United States supported the French army in suppressing the Algerian people, massacring more than 60,000 Algerians. In addition, during the discussion of the Tunisian and Moroccan issues at previous UN General Assemblies, the US representatives essentially supported the French government.

Aleya condemned the United States for once again helping the French colonialists attack the Algerian and Moroccan people. He particularly mentioned the fact that the United States supplied France with helicopters, believing that this provided convenience for the French army to search for Algerian guerrillas. Aleya said that the North African people will not be deceived by the sweet words of the United States. The North African people have already learned from the facts who their friends are.

    突尼斯访华代表团团长谈北非人民的斗争
    据新华社沈阳讯　正在沈阳参观的突尼斯访华友好代表团团长阿莱亚在接见本社记者时谈到突尼斯人民和阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民争取民族独立的斗争。他指出：最近法突自治协定的签订，只是突尼斯人民要求满足民族独立愿望的第一步。他又说：突尼斯人民坚决支持阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥兄弟人民要求民族权利的斗争，并且认为这个斗争是同自己的斗争分不开的。
    阿莱亚谴责法国殖民者最近对阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民的血腥镇压，指出这种镇压绝不能挫败阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民的正义斗争。他说：法国政府应该在承认阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民的民族要求的条件下立即同两国人民的代表谈判。
    阿莱亚说：亚非会议通过的最后公报支持北非人民的自决和独立权利，这鼓舞了北非人民的斗争，他说：这使北非人民知道他们的斗争不是孤立的。支持他们的有包括中国人民在内的亚、非国家人民这么大的力量。
    阿莱亚说，同亚、非国家人民相反，美国支持着法国镇压北非人民的军事行动。美国供给法国军队以武器，并且同意法国抽调北大西洋集团司令部指挥下的法军去增援北非法军。阿莱亚指出：美国支持法国统治北非并不是新鲜的事。早在一九四五年五月，美国就支持法军镇压阿尔及利亚人民，屠杀了六万多阿尔及利亚人。此外，在历届联合国大会讨论突尼斯和摩洛哥问题时，美国代表实质上都是支持法国政府的。
    阿莱亚谴责美国最近又一次帮助了法国殖民者进攻阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民，他特别提出美国供给法国直升飞机的事实，认为这对法军搜索阿尔及利亚游击队提供了便利。阿莱亚说：北非人民不会被美国的花言巧语所欺骗。北非人民已经根据事实，知道了谁是他们的朋友。
