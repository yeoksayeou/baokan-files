    Criticizing Liang Shuming's Reactionary Worldview
    Sun Dingguo
    To criticize Liang Shuming's reactionary ideological system, just like criticizing Hu Shi's thought, requires criticizing his reactionary worldview and epistemology. Because this is the theoretical foundation of his entire reactionary thought.
    Hu Shi was a subjective idealist, and Liang Shuming is also a subjective idealist. Liang Shuming, on this point, can be said to be quite open about it.
    In his "Morning Talks," when Liang Shuming spoke of his worldview, he said: "The fundamental concepts in my mind are 'life' and 'nature.' I see the universe as alive, and everything is based on nature. ... I devoted myself to Buddhism for a period, and then turned to Confucianism. ... What allowed me to enter the door was Wang Xinzhai, a Confucian scholar of the Ming Dynasty; he most praised nature, and from this, I came to understand the meaning of Confucianism. ... Later, after comparing it with Western thought, I felt that what could be expressed most thoroughly and what deeply interested me was the philosophy of life, whose main representative was Bergson. I remember twenty years ago, ... I then had a wish, to have ample time to read Mr. Bergson's books completely, which would be a great pleasure in life. Bergson's reasoning is most delightful, thorough, and clever. Although the Americans James and Dewey are not of the same school as Bergson, they all benefited from the concept of life and were influenced by biology before forming their learning."
    From this passage, it is clear that the center of Liang Shuming's philosophical thought is Bergson's "élan vital." Whether it is Buddhism, Confucius, or the Americans James and Dewey, or even the Englishman Russell, Liang Shuming uses Bergson's "élan vital" as a gray thread to connect them all. Precisely for this reason, the foundation of Liang Shuming's worldview and its entire ideological system cannot but have extremely reactionary characteristics.
    Our following analysis will prove this point.
    I. On Liang Shuming's Yogācāra Worldview and Epistemology
    Liang Shuming himself declares that "the method he uses to study knowledge is based on Yogācāra ... the epistemology of Yogācāra (note: i.e., epistemology - author)". However, Liang Shuming himself also said that he had revised Yogācāra. Therefore, it is quite appropriate to call it Liang Shuming's Yogācāra here. And it is precisely here that the subjective idealism—the egoistic essence of his worldview—can be fully seen.
    First, regarding his view of the "universe."
    Liang Shuming believes: "Life is nothing but endless desire ... and that constant satisfaction and dissatisfaction." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies") He also wrote: "According to our meaning, the entire universe is a life, only life, there is no universe at first. Because of the continuation of life, the universe seems to be constant, but in fact, the universe is a continuation of many, not like one existing intact. The universe is actually formed on top of life and exists relying on life." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," the emphasis in the last quote is mine - author.) This is Liang Shuming's fundamental view of the universe. According to Liang Shuming, the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of people's "desires" is an endless state of continuation, and people's lives are also in this endless state of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and this continuation of life, the continuation of "desires," constitutes the universe, constitutes the world. Therefore, he said that "the entire universe is a life, only life," "the universe is actually formed on top of life and exists relying on life." Therefore, we can conclude that the "nature" mentioned by Liang Shuming in "Morning Talks" is not the "nature" of the natural world that we usually talk about, but this "nature" is only the "universe"—the "universe" created and constituted by people's "desires" and people's lives—that Liang Shuming talks about here. Obviously, this is a purely subjective idealist worldview. Because, first, "the entire universe is a life, only life," and life is only people's "desires," which means that people's "desires" and people's "lives" are primary, while the universe and the world are secondary;
    Second, "the universe is actually formed on top of life and exists relying on life," which means that without people's "desires" and people's lives, the universe and the world would have nothing to rely on and could not exist; which means that the universe and the world are only included in people's "desires" and people's "lives."
    Obviously, this is a purely subjective idealist worldview that is sharply opposed to the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialist worldview.
    Precisely in this way, Liang Shuming's purely subjective idealist worldview cannot but reach the extremely reactionary conclusion of egoism.
    Liang Shuming further points out: Because the universe exists in the continuation of life, there is a "universe that is almost fixed... which is successfully made by our previous selves; this thing can be called 'the previous me' or 'the completed me'" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies"). And the current "desires" and current life are "the present me." He believes that "the previous me" and "the completed me" are "material," while "the present me" is mind or spirit; the opposition between mind or spirit and "matter" is also the opposition between "the present me" and "the previous me" and "the completed me." Please open your eyes, readers, what an undisguised egoistic worldview this is! This is equivalent to saying that the material world is me, and the spiritual world is also me; with me, there is a world; without me, there is no world.
    Therefore, our conclusion is that Liang Shuming's worldview is a subjective idealist worldview, a thoroughgoing egoism. Secondly, concerning Liang Shuming's epistemology. What kind of worldview will produce what kind of epistemology, Liang Shuming's epistemology more powerfully proves the subjective idealist and egoistic nature of his worldview.
    Liang Shuming said: "The terms commonly used by Yogācāra scholars for knowledge are 'direct perception,' 'inference,' and 'non-perception' (note: "direct perception" and "inference" are actually common terms in Buddhism, not exclusive to Yogācāra scholars - author). ... According to our meaning, the constitution of knowledge is due to these three 'measures.'" He also said: "These three 'measures' are three kinds of functions of the psychological aspect, and all knowledge is formed on top of these three kinds of functions. ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," the emphasis is mine - author.)
    Clearly, this so-called three "measures" is the basis of Liang Shuming's epistemology.
    Please, readers, be patient and listen to Liang Shuming's explanation of the three "measures."
    A. Regarding "Direct Perception"—"The so-called 'direct perception' is sensation. For example, the taste of tea that I taste when I drink tea, or the white color that I get when I see white cloth on the table, are all 'direct perception.' But here, it must be stated that when feeling, one does not know what the taste of tea or the white color is, only the feeling of tea or white color obtained from the sense of taste or sight without the meaning contained in the taste of tea or white color; ... Therefore, the function of 'direct perception' is only pure sensation. ... The reason why I feel 'white' is because of the reflection of the optic nerve to external stimuli; (regrettably, Liang Shuming also uses the words "external world" here - author) as for the white cloth itself, ... whether it is white or not white, we have no way of knowing; because no matter who it is, one cannot but use the eyes to see, and when using the eyes to see, what one gets is what is transformed by my eye consciousness, not the essence of the cloth. ... Therefore, white is actually created by the subjective, not inherent in the cloth." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies")
    Here, it is necessary to make a note. The meaning of "measure" is the source of knowledge or the tool for obtaining knowledge. "Direct perception" means sensory knowledge. However, it is very clear that the "direct perception" that Liang Shuming talks about here is absolutely different from the fact that we talk about people obtaining knowledge through the senses from the objective external world. For Liang Shuming, although he also talks about things like "'white' is reflected by the optic nerve to external stimuli," these things have no meaning to him. He believes that the white of the white cloth that people see is not inherent in the white cloth, but is only produced by people's vision. That is to say, in his view, without people's vision, there would be no white of the white cloth. Therefore, his so-called "direct perception" or sensation is a purely subjective thing without objective content; at the same time, the white cloth, as an objective existence, also depends on his sensation; only because of his sensation, there is the white of the white cloth, "white is actually created by the subjective." That is to say: Sensation is primary, and matter is secondary. From the perspective of dialectical materialism, people's sensation has its objective content, and this objective content is something that exists independently of people's sensation. That is to say, matter is primary, and sensation is secondary. Lenin said: "Sensation is the result of the action of things-in-themselves existing objectively outside of us on our sense organs... sensation is a subjective image of the objective world, the world an und für sich (in itself)." He also said: "If color is sensation only when it depends on the retina (as natural science compels you to admit), then it means that the light falling on the retina causes the sensation of color. That is to say, outside of us, independently of us and our consciousness, there exists the movement of matter, for example, the movement of light waves of a certain length and a certain speed, which act on the retina and cause this or that sensation of color in people. This is exactly how natural science sees it. It uses the various lengths of light waves existing outside the human retina, outside of people, and independent of people, to explain the various sensations of color." ("Materialism and Empirio-criticism") These words were said by Lenin when criticizing Machism, but they are also the most powerful refutation of Liang Shuming's so-called "direct perception," that is, his theory of sensation.
    B. Regarding "Inference"—"'Inferential knowledge' is what is now called 'intellect,' and it is also a kind of function of our psychological aspect to construct knowledge. For example, how is my knowledge of tea obtained and constructed? It is by seeing and drinking tea many times, distinguishing it from all non-tea things—white water, vegetable soup, oil, wine,...—and extracting its common meaning from all kinds of tea—black tea, green tea, light tea, strong tea...—when one sees tea, one can recognize it, which is when the concept of tea is clearest, most understood, and most certain. The function of constructing concepts in this way can be divided into two kinds of functions: simplification, synthesis—separation, combination... This kind of simplification and synthesis is what is called 'inferential knowledge.'... What is recognized by this kind of cognitive function? It is meaning—concept—that is, what Yogācāra scholars call 'universal characteristics,' and its realm is called 'unique shadow realm.' 'Unique shadow realm' has shadows but no substance; when I have a thought of 'tea' in my heart, what I think of is also an image,... to put it bluntly, it is not transformed by borrowing from objective things, but is privately owned and self-generated by my heart." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," the emphasis is mine - author.)
    Here, it is also necessary to make a note. "Inference" means reasoning, and "inferential knowledge" means knowledge obtained through reasoning. But it is also very clear that the "reasoning" that Liang Shuming talks about here has no common ground with what we usually call the ascent from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. The simplification, synthesis, separation, and combination he talks about also have no common ground with the analysis and synthesis we talk about. This is because his so-called understanding of tea, the concept of tea, the meaning or "universal characteristics" of tea is a kind of "unique shadow realm," and this "unique shadow realm" is a kind of thing that "has shadows but no substance." Therefore, the understanding, concept, meaning, and "universal characteristics" of tea are not transformed by borrowing from objective things, and are not objective qualities inherent in tea itself reflected in people's minds, but are "privately owned and self-generated" by people's hearts. Therefore, the simplification, synthesis, separation, and combination he talks about are not extracting its essence from objective things, but his subjective mind is playing a conceptual game, so his so-called "inferential knowledge" or knowledge of reasoning is his subjective thing, which is "privately owned and self-generated" by himself. What does this illustrate? This illustrates that, according to Liang Shuming's view, human reason is primary, and objective matter is secondary. Obviously, Liang Shuming does not acknowledge the objective material basis in the stage of perceptual knowledge, so he will certainly think that human reasoning knowledge is purely subjective.
    From the perspective of dialectical materialism: Perceptual knowledge is a reflection of the objective material world, and rational knowledge is also a reflection of the objective material world, and it is a deeper and more accurate reflection. Marxism-Leninism believes that rational knowledge is not only not further away from the objective material world, but also reflects the objective material world more deeply and more accurately. Concepts are not things that are "privately owned and self-generated" by people's minds, but are scientific reflections of the objective material world.
    C. Regarding Intuition—"Non-Perception"—"... From the feeling of direct perception to the abstract concept of inference, there must also be a stage of 'intuition'; relying solely on direct perception and inference will not succeed. This is my revision of Yogācāra scholars. What intuition recognizes is only a kind of meaning, spirit, trend, or tendency. ... For example, when we hear a sound and feel it is wonderful, when we see a painting and feel it is beautiful, when we eat sugar and feel it is delicious, in fact, there is nothing wonderful in the sound itself, nothing beautiful in the painting itself, and nothing delicious in the sugar itself; all the meanings such as wonderful, beautiful, and delicious are all wantonly added by people's intuition. Therefore, intuition is 'non-perception.'" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," the emphasis is mine - author.)
    This wonderful passage must be annotated. Liang Shuming means that what intuition has is not what "inference" and "direct perception" can have, and only intuition can give it. What intuition gives is something that the objective world does not have. Everything that people feel about the objective material world, whether it is the wonder of sound, the beauty of painting, the deliciousness of sugar, etc., is not inherent in them, but is wantonly added by people's "intuition." That is to say: The sound of "Yangchun Baixue" is not wonderful, people's "intuition" gives it wonder; the paintings of Qiu Shizhou and Qi Baishi are not beautiful, people's "intuition" gives them beauty; chocolate and fruit candy are not delicious, people's "intuition" gives them deliciousness. This miraculous "intuition" is not a general psychological function, but a special psychological function with strange magic, so Liang Shuming specially used the word "intuition" to replace the word "non-perception," meaning to use this to more powerfully express this special psychological function that goes beyond "direct perception" and "inference." Liang Shuming's "genius" "revision" more clearly expresses the essence of subjective idealist epistemology.
    We have briefly analyzed Liang Shuming's so-called three "measures," and it can be completely seen that his epistemology has a completely subjective idealist nature. However, it is also necessary for us to further analyze the eighth consciousness—"Ālaya-vijñāna"—in Yogācāra that Liang Shuming specially grasps, in order to excavate the profound consistency of Liang Shuming's epistemology and worldview.
    Here, it should first be explained what "Ālaya-vijñāna" is.
    To explain "Ālaya-vijñāna," one must first explain the Buddhist "Tathātā." The so-called "Tathātā" means the "substance of the mind," and this "substance of the mind" is the entirety of the world—the source from which all things in the world arise, and this "Tathātā" or "substance of the mind" is precisely expressed through "Ālaya-vijñāna."
    Therefore, from the perspective of Yogācāra, "Ālaya-vijñāna" expresses "Tathātā" or "the substance of the mind," so it cannot but be something that determines everything.
    According to Jiang Weiqiao's statement: "Ālaya... is translated as 'store,' meaning containing; the seeds of all things in the universe are stored in this consciousness, so it is also called storehouse consciousness" ("An Outline of Buddhism"). This means that "Ālaya-vijñāna" includes the seeds of all things and phenomena in the universe, and the seeds of all things and phenomena in the universe arise from "Ālaya-vijñāna." According to Kiyohide Ono's statement: "All the seeds in Ālaya-vijñāna are the infinite ability to discover all phenomena; from these seeds, our root body arises; at the same time, the objective world (i.e., all things) in which it resides suddenly manifests; ... these various phenomena of the objective world are ultimately discovered by the perceptual function of the subjective inner consciousness, without perception, there are no phenomena." ("Buddhist Philosophy") This means that "Ālaya-vijñāna" on the one hand produces people, and on the other hand produces the objective world in which people live. And the myriad phenomena of the objective world are derived from the perception of people's subjective consciousness, and without the perception of subjective consciousness, there would be nothing in the world. Therefore, everything is contained in "Ālaya."
    From this, the internal connection between "Ālaya-vijñāna" and "Tathātā" or "the substance of the mind" can be completely seen. As Kiyohide Ono said: "In the theory of Ālaya origination, on the stage of Tathātā, there is the omnipotent actor of Ālaya, presenting this dance and performing the phenomena of the world; what is now said refers to Tathātā itself, disguising and dancing, and performing the phenomena of the world; like water and waves, although the two are different, their substance is no different, they are entirely one thing." ("Buddhist Philosophy") Obviously, this entirely one thing is precisely entirely one mind. "Tathātā" is like water, "Ālaya" is like waves, water is waves, and waves are also water, "Tathātā" is one mind, "Ālaya" is also one mind, and one mind is the entirety of the world, which is also the origin of all things. This is the fundamental idea that "Ālaya-vijñāna" occupies a special and important position in Yogācāra, and this is precisely the fundamental reason why Liang Shuming specially grasps "Ālaya-vijñāna" and does not let it go. Below is Liang Shuming's "wonderful article" praising "Ālaya-vijñāna": "... The only object is this Ālaya-vijñāna, looking east and looking west, looking up and looking down, looking inside and looking outside, what you encounter is all him, but not only are the images changing at any time, non-constant things, but the essence inside and outside, you see the dead material world, is actually flowing and continuous. ... Not only are the images changing with people and different, the red and white shown by your eye consciousness belong to you, the red and white shown by my eye consciousness belong to me; even the essence is not objectively existing but different with people, your universe is what you show, my universe is what I show. At this time, the most noteworthy thing is that the inside and outside are all one Ālaya-vijñāna." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies") What is there to say about this? With the mind as the main body, with "Tathātā" as the main body, the mind (or "Tathātā") dances through the "omnipotent actor of Ālaya" to create the myriad worlds. So that looking east and looking west, looking up and looking down, looking inside and looking outside, what one encounters is all "Ālaya-vijñāna." In other words, the three realms of heaven and earth, the ten directions of all spirits, are all manifestations of "Ālaya-vijñāna," and they are all creations of "Ālaya-vijñāna." As for the dead material world, not only can its image only be different with the changes of people's various consciousnesses, the red and white shown by your eye consciousness belong to you, and the red and white shown by my eye consciousness belong to me, but even the essence that expresses these images is not objectively existing. It can only be different with the manifestations of different people's senses. Your universe is what you show, and my universe is what I show, then, there are 600 million people in China, and there are 600 million universes, there are 2.4 billion people in the world, and there are 2.4 billion universes. That's how Liang Shuming fell into absolute egoism.
    Therefore, we say that Liang Shuming's epistemology more powerfully and deeply expresses the reactionary nature of his worldview of subjective idealism and egoism. II. On Liang Shuming's Bergsonism
    In his article "On Life and Upward Creation," Liang Shuming clearly reveals how his Yogācāra and Bergsonism are cleverly linked together. He wrote: "Life and living, in my opinion, are actually purely the same thing" ("Morning Talks"). However, in his view, life is the substance, living is the use, life is a noun, and living is a verb. He also wrote: "What is life? It is the living continuation." "Upward creation is flexible and vigorous progress, which can be divided into two points: (1) turning upward to a higher level, (2) developing towards a broader scope. Life (or organisms) has been like this from the beginning to mankind—to the present mankind, it is still like this. The history of biological evolution and the history of human culture all show this upward and expansion. Even now, our desire for good and the spirit of pursuing ideals are nothing more than this. Having developed to this point, it has proved the victory of life." ("Morning Talks"). Liang Shuming here again asserts that life is self-expanding and self-extending, and that life is created upward through its upward turning and development from a broad scope. The history of biological evolution and the history of human evolution are all histories of life's self-expansion and self-extension. Readers can see at a glance that everything Liang Shuming asserts is a complete replica of Bergson's "élan vital." Liang Shuming not only revised Yogācāra with Bergson's intuitionism, as he himself said, but more importantly, he rendered Dewey with Bergson's "élan vital," dressed up Confucius, and finally prostrated himself at the feet of Russell. From his reactionary worldview, he derived reactionary views of history and society. First, regarding Dewey. People all know that Liang Shuming and Hu Shi were a pair of "experts" who sang a duet, opposing Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese Communist Party. Although one was singing a tune of "going west" and the other was singing a tune of "going east," they were exchanging affectionate glances from beginning to end, "different tunes" but "same effect." We are not in a hurry to point out the common points between them in the political aspect here, but should first point out the common points in the philosophical aspect, that is, Hu Shi is an admirer and propagator of Dewey, and Liang Shuming is also an admirer and propagator of Dewey. Hu Shi called Dewey a "great philosopher," and Liang Shuming called Dewey a "great scholar," but the most wonderful thing here is that Liang Shuming's admiration and propaganda of Dewey further brought Dewey and Bergson together, and also said that Dewey and himself "have mutual inventions." He said: "Dewey's learning comes from biology, while I am influenced by Bergson. Bergson is a biologist. When Dewey speaks, he cannot do without 'life,' and 'life' is something that runs through everything; close your eyes and think about it, it is life, open your mouth and speak about it, it is life, everything belongs to life. Everything belongs to biological evolution. The concept of biological evolution is the foundation of his theory." ("Liang Shuming's Educational Essays") Therefore, he believes that Dewey's main concept is the concept of life. "The universe is a great life, and understanding life is understanding the universe." "But there is one place that is the core of the great life of the universe, and this place is 'man.' Life is alive, and the most alive thing in the universe is the human heart. If one can recognize the human heart, one can recognize the life of the universe." "Tracing upward from individual life, one enters the realm of natural sciences (such as psychology, physiology, biology, etc.); tracing downward from social life, one enters the realm of social sciences. Cosmic phenomena are nothing more than these two." Therefore, Dewey's learning, especially his education, "can connect all aspects together, pursuing upward and downward, and everything is connected." ("Liang Shuming's Educational Essays") Saying that the universe is a great life, and the core of this great life is the human heart, recognizing the human heart is recognizing life, and recognizing the universe. This is equivalent to saying "the universe is my mind, and I am the universe." This is completely subjective idealism. Saying that tracing upward from individual life is natural science, and tracing downward from social life is social science, this is equivalent to saying that the laws of nature and the laws of society are based on life (of course, also based on the human heart), and are the laws of life development. This is using a purely biological viewpoint to study social issues and historical issues, that is, using the reactionary viewpoint of "élan vital" to study social issues and historical issues. Readers know that this is originally the foundation of the social theory of imperialism, and Liang Shuming attempts to mix the blue devil and the black devil together to jointly attack the scientific worldview, historical view, and social view of Marxism-Leninism. Liang Shuming shamelessly declared: "Now mankind is in confusion because the new trend in the academic world has a tendency to deny life,... Since the invention of Darwin's theory, the theory of life has been fashionable, and it has been talked about everywhere, but now it is no longer fashionable. Just in the United States, Dewey is not considered fashionable either. In my opinion, for mankind's confusion to be resolved, it is necessary to turn over again, break through the current difficult situation, break through the anti-life trend, and then be enlightened. I am defending Dewey; Dewey himself cannot break through this difficult situation, not because he does not have combat power, but because he is trapped in the Western ideological world and cannot break out of the encirclement. Only the support of an Eastern army can break out of the encirclement. If my spiritual power is sufficient, I can help him fight for a while." ("Liang Shuming's Educational Essays") What a murderous Liang Shuming, the only reason why he wants to Bergsonize Dewey, the only reason why he wants to say that he and Dewey have mutual inventions is that he wants to awaken the zombie of Dewey's pragmatism with the ghost of Bergson's élan vital, that is, he wants to be Dewey's accomplice, wants to be Dewey's support army in the East, and wants to help him break out of the encirclement. And the reason why he wants to do this is to use the reactionary theory of neo-Darwinism—the survival of the fittest—which serves imperialism, in the social sciences to resist Marxism-Leninism. Unfortunately, Liang Shuming's "spiritual power" and Bergson's "élan vital" are equally weak, and his support army is completely useless. Secondly, regarding Confucius.
    Liang Shuming called Confucius a "intuitionist" in "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," and a "rationalist" in "The Essentials of Chinese Culture." According to Liang Shuming, "The so-called sage of Confucianism is the one who can best understand himself and make life become wisdom," "The Confucian saying 'following one's heart's desire without transgressing the rules' means that life has successfully become wisdom,—as if the whole body is transparent." Therefore, Liang Shuming believes that the Confucian sayings "'Heaven does not speak? The four seasons proceed, and all things are born.' 'Achieving harmony, heaven and earth are in their place, and all things are nurtured.' are all full expressions of the meaning of the naturalness of life." Because Confucius is such a "élan vital" believer, Confucius's "intuitionism" and "rationalism" all originate from life. Because Confucius discovered the "rationalism" in human life and called on people to exert effort inward rather than outward, calling on people to "not use wisdom outward, but return it to one's own life, making life wise, not wisdom serving life." ("Morning Talks") What is there to say about this? In Liang Shuming's flowery language, with three strokes and five strokes, he depicts Confucius as a typical Bergsonian, and all of Confucius's remarks can be attributed to "reason," that is, all can be attributed to "life." "The former sage and the latter sage follow the same principle." The reason why Liang Shuming does this is to use "élan vital" to resist Marxism-Leninism. We know that it is precisely on this basis that Liang Shuming arbitrarily and willfully depicts how Confucius's "rational supremacy" constitutes the "theory" of "Chinese cultural particularism," and violently uses Liang Shuming's "Confucianism" to resist the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Thirdly, regarding Russell. Liang Shuming has constantly declared that Russell is the person who understands the characteristics of Chinese culture the most. He called Russell's words, spoken in the capacity of an imperialist spokesperson, "for China's sake, for the world's sake, cultural issues are the most important," "deeply affectionate and insightful," and even shed tears for it. Obviously, Russell's words were meant to call on the Chinese people to restore their inherent culture and be ruled by imperialism for a long time. The reason why Russell's thought was called "deeply affectionate and insightful" by Liang Shuming is that he believed that it coincided with his advocacy of Confucius's "rational supremacy," which, of course, is also not contradictory to Bergson's "élan vital." Therefore, in Liang Shuming's writings, it is by no means accidental that his view of history and society finally coincide completely with Russell's. This method of changing the soup without changing the medicine, from Bergson to Dewey, and then from Dewey to Russell, is not beneficial to the feudal class, the comprador bourgeoisie, and imperialism? Is it not beneficial to anti-Marxism-Leninism? Obviously, as long as it is beneficial to the feudal class, the comprador bourgeoisie, and imperialism, as long as it is beneficial to anti-Marxism-Leninism, Liang Shuming will "eclectically" collect it. Our conclusion is that Liang Shuming's philosophical thought, although extremely chaotic and extremely complex, has a guiding thread here, which is Bergson's "élan vital." Based on this, he connected Yogācāra, Dewey, Confucius, and Russell, and formed Liang Shuming's own extremely cheap and extremely reactionary philosophical system.

    批判梁漱溟的反动的世界观
    孙定国
    要批判梁漱溟的反动的思想体系，正像批判胡适的思想一样，也需要批判他的反动的世界观、认识论。因为这是他的整个的反动思想的理论基础。
    胡适是主观唯心主义，梁漱溟也还是主观唯心主义。梁漱溟在这一点上，可以说是并不掩饰的。
    梁漱溟在他的“朝话”中讲到他的宇宙观时说：“在我思想中的根本观念是‘生命’‘自然’，看宇宙是活的，一切以自然为宗。……我曾有一个时期致力过佛学，然后转到儒家。……使我得门而入的，是明儒王心斋先生；他最称颂自然，我便是由此而对儒家的意思有所理会。……后来再与西洋思想印证，觉得最能发挥尽致，使我深感兴趣的是生命派哲学，其主要代表者为柏格森。记得二十年前，……当时尝有愿心，愿有从容时间尽读柏氏书，是人生一大乐事。柏氏说理最痛快、透彻、聪明。美国詹姆士、杜威与柏氏，虽非同一学派，但皆曾得力于生命观念，受生物学影响，而后成其所学。”
    从这一段话里清楚地看出梁漱溟哲学思想的中心是柏格森的“生命力论”。无论是佛家、孔子以及美国的詹姆士、杜威，甚至是英国的罗素，梁漱溟都以柏格森的“生命力论”这条灰色的线把它们贯串起来的。正为此，梁漱溟的世界观的基础和它的整个思想体系就不能不具有极为反动的性质。
    我们以下的分析即将证明这一点。
    一、关于梁漱溟的唯识学的世界观和认识论
    梁漱溟自己宣称，他“研究知识所用的方法，就是根据于唯识学……唯识学的知识论（按：即认识论——作者）”。但是，梁漱溟自己又说，他对唯识学进行过修订。因此我们在这里把它叫做是梁漱溟的唯识学是十分恰当的。而且正是在这里已经完全可以看出他的世界观的主观唯心主义——唯我主义的实质。
    首先是关于他对“宇宙”的看法。
    梁漱溟认为：“生活就是没尽的意欲……和那不断的满足与不满足罢了。”（“东西文化及其哲学”）他又写道：“照我们的意思，尽宇宙是一生活，只是生活，初无宇宙。由生活相续，故尔宇宙似乎恒在，其实宇宙是多的相续，不似一的宛在。宇宙实成于生活之上，托乎生活而存者也。”（“东西文化及其哲学”，最后一句引文的着重点是我加的——作者。）这就是梁漱溟关于宇宙的根本看法，按照梁漱溟的意思就是，人的“意欲”的满足和不满足是无穷无尽的相续状态，人的生活也就是处在这种无穷无尽的“意欲”的满足和不满足的相续状态之中，而这种生活的相续、“意欲”的相续，也就构成了宇宙，构成了世界。因此，他才说“尽宇宙是一生活，只是生活”，“宇宙实成于生活之上，托乎生活而存”。因此，我们可以断定，梁漱溟在“朝话”中所说的“自然”两字并不是我们通常所说的自然界的“自然”，而这个“自然”只不过是梁漱溟在这里所说的“宇宙”——人的“意欲”、人的生活所创造的、所构成的“宇宙”。显然，这是纯粹主观唯心主义的世界观。因为，第一、“尽宇宙是一生活，只是生活”，而生活又只是人的“意欲”，这就是说：人的“意欲”、人的“生活”才是第一性的，而宇宙、世界却是第二性的；
    第二、“宇宙实成于生活之上，托乎生活而存”，这就是说：没有人的“意欲”，没有人的生活、宇宙、世界就无所倚托，就不能存在；这就是说：宇宙、世界只是包括在人的“意欲”和人的“生活”之中。
    显然，这是同马克思列宁主义辩证唯物主义的世界观尖锐对立着的纯粹主观唯心主义的世界观。
    正是这样，梁漱溟的纯粹主观唯心主义的世界观不能不达到唯我主义的极端反动的结论。
    梁漱溟进一步指出：由于宇宙是存在于生活相续之中的，因此，有一个“差不多成定局的宇宙……是由我们前此的自己而成功这样的；这个东西可以叫做‘前此的我’或‘已成的我’”（“东西文化及其哲学”）。而现在的“意欲”、现在的生活就是“现在的我”。他认为“前此的我”、“已成的我”是“物质”的，而“现在的我”是心或精神的；心或精神和“物质”的相对待，也就是“现在的我”和“前此的我”、“已成的我”相对待。请读者开开眼界，这是多么露骨的唯我主义的世界观呵！这就等于说，物质的世界是我，精神的世界也是我，有我就有世界，无我就无世界。
    因此，我们的结论是：梁漱溟的世界观是主观唯心主义的世界观，是彻底的唯我主义。其次是关于梁漱溟的认识论。什么样子的世界观就要产生什么样子的认识论，梁漱溟的认识论更加有力地证明了他的世界观的主观唯心主义和唯我主义的性质。
    梁漱溟说：“唯识家讲知识所常用的名词就是‘现量’，‘比量’，‘非量’（按“现量”、“比量”实际上是佛家的通用语。并不是唯识家的专用语——作者）。……知识之构成，照我们的意思，即由于此三量。”他并说：“此三量是心理方面的三种作用，一切知识皆成于此三种作用之上。（“东西文化及其哲学”，着重点是我加的——作者。）
    很明白，这所谓三“量”的说法，是梁漱溟的认识论的基础。
    请读者耐烦一点听取梁漱溟关于三“量”的解释。
    甲、关于“现量”——“所谓‘现量’就是感觉（Sensation）。譬如我喝茶时所尝到的茶味，或我看桌上白布所得到的白色，都是‘现量’。却是此处要声明，感觉时并不晓得什么是茶味或白色，只有由味觉或视觉所得到茶或白色的感觉而无茶味或白色所含的意义；……所以‘现量’的作用只是单纯的感觉。……我所以觉得‘白’是由视神经对于外界刺激而反射者；（遗憾得很，梁漱溟在此亦用起外界两个字来了——作者）至于白布的自己，……其是白非白，我们无从而知；因为无论什么人不能不用眼睛看，用眼睛看时，所得即为我眼识之所变现，而非布之本质。……故白实出主观所造，非布固有。”（“东西文化及其哲学”）
    这里需要注解一下，“量”的意思是知识的来源或者是获得知识的工具。“现量”就是感觉知识的意思。但是，这是十分清楚的，梁漱溟在这里所讲的“现量”，是绝不同于我们所说的，人们通过感官对于客观外界的感觉以获得知识的事实。对于梁漱溟，虽然也谈到什么“‘白’是由视神经对于外界刺激而反射”等等，但是，这些东西在他是没有任何意义的。他认为人们所看到白布的白，并不是白布所固有，而只是人们的视觉所产生的。这就是说，在他看来，没有人们的视觉，就没有白布的白。因此，他的所谓“现量”或感觉，就是没有客观内容的纯主观的东西；同时，作为客观存在的白布也是依存于他的感觉的，只因为有了他的感觉，才有白布的白，“白实出主观所造”。这就是说：感觉是第一性的，而物质是第二性的。从辩证唯物主义的观点看来，人们的感觉是有其客观内容的，而这个客观内容则是不依赖于人们的感觉而独立存在着的东西。这就是说，物质是第一性的，感觉是第二性的。列宁说：“感觉是客观地存在于我们之外的物自体作用于我们感觉器官的结果……感觉是客观世界、世界an　und　für　sich（自体）底主观映象。”他又说：“如果颜色只有依存于眼网膜时才是感觉（如自然科学逼迫你们承认的那样），那末，就是说，落到眼网膜上的光线才引起颜色底感觉。这就是说，在我们之外，不依存于我们和我们的意识，存在着物质底运动，例如，一定长度和一定速度的光波运动，它们作用在眼网膜上，就在人里面引起这种或那种颜色底感觉。自然科学正是这样看的。它用存在于人的眼网膜之外、人之外，和不依存于人的光波的种种长度来说明种种颜色底感觉。”（“唯物论与经验批判论”）这些话是列宁在批判马赫主义的时候说的，然而也恰恰是对于梁漱溟所说的“现量”也就是他的感觉论的最有力的驳斥。
    乙、关于“比量”——“‘比量智’即是今所谓‘理智’，也是我们心理方面去构成知识的一种作用。譬如我对于茶之知识是怎样得来构成的呢？就是看见，喝过多少次的茶，从所有非茶的东西——白水，菜汤，油，酒，……——分别开来，而从种种的茶——红茶，绿茶，清茶，浓茶……——抽出其共同意义，见了茶即能认识，这就是对于茶的概念最清晰，明白，确定的时候。如此构成概念之作用可分为简，综，——分，合——两种作用。……此种简综的作用即所谓‘比量智’。……此种认识作用所认识的是什么呢？就是意义——概念——即唯识家所谓‘共相’，而其境则所谓‘独影境’也。‘独影境’是有影无质的；当我心中作‘茶’之一念时，其所缘念亦为一影象，……照直说，就是非借于客观之物才变生的，而是我心所自生私有的。”（“东西文化及其哲学”，着重点是我加的——作者。）
    在这里也需要注解一下，“比”是推理的意思，“比量”也就是推理知识的意思。但这也是十分清楚的，梁漱溟在这里所说的“推理”同我们通常所说的由感性认识上升到理性认识也是没有丝毫共同之点的，他所说的简、综、分、合，和我们所说的分析、综合也是没有任何共同之点的。这就是因为他所说的对于茶的认识，对于茶的概念，茶的意义或“共相”是一种“独影境”，而这个“独影境”乃是一种“有影无质”的东西。因此，关于茶的认识、概念、意义、“共相”并不是借客观之物才变生的，并不是茶本身所固有的客观的质在人们头脑中的反映，而是人心所“自生私有”的。因此，他所说的简、综、分、合不是从客观事物中抽寻出来它的本质而是他的主观头脑在作概念游戏，从而他的所谓“比量”或者说是推理的知识乃是他主观的东西，是他自己“自生私有”的东西。这说明了什么呢？这就说明了，照梁漱溟的看法，人的理性是第一性的，客观物质是第二性的。显然，梁漱溟既不承认在感性认识阶段的客观物质基础，当然也会认为人的推理认识是纯主观的。
    从辩证唯物主义的观点看来：感性认识是客观物质世界的反映，理性认识也是客观物质世界的反映，而且是更深刻、更正确的反映。马克思列宁主义认为：理性认识不仅不是更远离了客观物质世界，而且是更深入、更正确地反映了客观物质世界。概念并非人的头脑“自生私有”的东西，而是客观物质世界的科学的反映。
    丙、关于直觉—“非量”——“……从现量的感觉到比量的抽象概念，中间还须有‘直觉’之一阶段；单靠现量与比量是不成功的。这个话是我对于唯识家的修订。凡直觉所认识的只是一种意味精神，趋势或倾向。……譬如我们听见声音觉得甚妙，看见绘画觉得甚美，吃糖觉得好吃，其实在声音自身无所谓妙，绘画自身无所谓美，糖的自身无所谓好吃；所有妙，美，好吃等等意味都由人的直觉所妄添的。所以直觉就是‘非量’。”（“东西文化及其哲学”，着重点是我加的——作者。）
    这一段绝妙的文章，必须注解一番。梁漱溟的意思是说直觉所有的东西并不是“比量”与“现量”所能有的，而只有直觉才能给予。直觉所给予的乃是客观世界所没有的东西。人们对于客观物质世界所感觉到的一切，不论是声音之妙，绘画之美，糖之好吃等等都不是它们本身所固有，而是人们的“直觉”所妄添的。这就是说：“阳春白雪”的声音并不妙，人们的“直觉”给它以妙；仇十洲、齐白石的绘画并不美，人们的“直觉”给它以美；巧克力和水果糖并不好吃，人们的“直觉”给它以好吃。这个神妙的“直觉”不是一般的心理作用，而是具有奇异魔力的特殊心理作用，所以梁漱溟特地用“直觉”一词来代替“非量”一词，意思就是借此更有力地表现出这种超出“现量”、“比量”之外的特殊的心理作用。梁漱溟这个“天才的”“修订”是更明显地把主观唯心主义的认识论实质表现出来了。
    我们扼要地分析了梁漱溟的所谓三“量”问题，已经完全可以看出他的认识论的彻底主观唯心主义的性质。但是，我们还有必要进一步分析一下梁漱溟所特别抓住的唯识学中的第八识——“阿赖耶识”，借以挖掘梁漱溟的认识论和世界观深刻的一贯性。
    在这里应首先解释一下什么是“阿赖耶识”。
    要解释“阿赖耶识”必须首先解释一下佛家的“真如”。所谓“真如”也就是“心的实体”的意思，而这个“心的实体”也就是世界的全体——世界的万事万物所借以发生的源泉，而这个“真如”或者说是“心的实体”恰恰就是通过“阿赖耶识”表现出来。
    因此，在唯识学看来，“阿赖耶识”即是表现“真如”或“心的实体”的，它就不能不是决定一切的东西。
    根据蒋维乔的说法：“阿赖耶……译为藏，即含藏之意；宇宙万有之种子，悉藏于此识中，故亦名藏识”（“佛教概论”）。这就是说，“阿赖耶识”是包括宇宙间万物万象的种子，宇宙间的一切事物现象的种子，都是从“阿赖耶识”而发生出来。根据小野清秀的说法：“阿赖耶识中一切之种子，即是发现万象无限之能力；从此种子，吾人之根身发生；同时使其住居之客观界，（即万物）顿变现出；……此万差之客观界诸现象，毕竟由主观内意识之知觉作用而发现者，无知觉则无万象。”（“佛教哲学”）这就是说：“阿赖耶识”一方面产生了人，一方面又产生了人所居住的客观世界。而客观世界的万象又是人的主观意识的知觉所派生的，没有主观意识的知觉也就没有世界上的一切。因此，一切都是包藏在“阿赖耶”之中。
    从这里完全可以看出“阿赖耶识”和“真如”或“心的实体”的内在联系。正如小野清秀所说：“在阿赖耶缘起论，则是真如舞台之上，有阿赖耶万能之伶人，献此舞蹈，演成世界现象；今所说者，乃指真如自身，化装而舞蹈，演出世界现象；如水与波，二者虽异，而其体则无别，全是一物也。”（“佛教哲学”）显然，这个全是一物恰恰就是全是一心。“真如”如水，“阿赖耶”如波，水是波，波亦是水，“真如”是一心，“阿赖耶”也是一心，而一心也就是世界全体，也就是万物之本。这就是“阿赖耶识”在唯识学中之所以占有特殊重要地位的根本思想，而这恰恰亦是梁漱溟特别抓住“阿赖耶识”不放的根本原因之所在。下边就是梁漱溟歌颂“阿赖耶识”的“绝妙奇文”：“……唯一的物件只此阿赖耶识，东看西看，上看下看，内看外看，所碰到的都是他，不过不单影象是随时变现，非恒在的东西，就是这内外的本质，你看他死呆呆的物质世界，实在也是迁流不息，相续而转。……不单影象是随人变现各自不同，你眼识所现的红白属你，我眼识所现的红白属我；就是本质也非客观存在而是随人不同的，你的宇宙是你所现，我的宇宙是我所现。此时最可注意的，内外俱是一阿赖耶识”。（“东西文化及其哲学”）这有什么可说的呢？以心为主体，以“真如”为主体，心（或者说是“真如”）通过“阿赖耶万能之伶人”舞蹈起来，就可以创造万有的世界。以至于东看西看，上看下看，内看外看，所碰到的都是“阿赖耶识”。换句话说，天地三界，十方万灵，都是“阿赖耶识”之所显现，也就都是“阿赖耶识”之创造。至于物质世界这个呆呆的东西，不仅它的影象只能是随着人的各识的变现而有所不同，你眼识所现的红白是属于你的，我眼识所现的红白是属于我的，而且即使表现这些影象的本质也都不是客观存在的。它只能是随着不同的人们的感官的显现而有所不同。你的宇宙是你所现，我的宇宙是我所现，那末，全中国有六万万人，就有六万万个宇宙，全世界有二十四万万人，就有二十四万万个宇宙。就是这样，梁漱溟陷入绝对唯我主义了。
    所以我们说，梁漱溟的认识论更有力地同时也是更深刻地表现了他的世界观的主观唯心主义和唯我主义的反动性质。二、关于梁漱溟的柏格森主义
    梁漱溟在“谈生命与向上创造”一文中，清楚地揭示出他的唯识学和柏格森主义是怎样巧妙地挂起钩来的。他写道：“生命与生活，在我说实际上是纯然一回事”（“朝话”）。不过在他看来，生命是体，生活是用，生命是名词，生活是动词。他又写道：“生命是什么？就是活的相续。”“向上创造就是灵活奋进，细分析之可有两点（一）向上翻高，（二）往广阔里开展。生命（或生物）自开头起就是这么一回事，一直到人类——到现在的人类，仍是这么一回事。生物进化史、人类文化史，在在都表明这向上与扩大。以至现在我们要好的心，奔赴理想的精神，还无非是这回事。发展到此，已证明生命的胜利。”（“朝话”）。梁漱溟在这里又断定生命是自我扩大和自我扩张的，生命是通过它的向上翻转，从广阔里开展而向上创造的。生物进化史、人类进化史都是生命的自我扩大和自我扩张的历史。读者一看就清楚梁漱溟所断定的这一切，完全是柏格森的“生命力论”的翻版。梁漱溟不仅如同他自己所说的以柏格森的直觉主义修订了唯识学，而且更重要的是他以柏格森的“生命力论”渲染了杜威、乔装了孔子，而最后又拜倒在罗素的脚下。从他的反动的世界观引伸出反动的历史观、社会观。首先是关于杜威。人们都知道：反对马克思列宁主义、反对中国共产党，梁漱溟和胡适是一对唱双簧的“能手”。尽管是一个唱着“向西走”的调子，一个唱着“向东走”的调子，但是他们自始至终是互送秋波，“异曲”而“同工”的。我们在这里且不急于指出他们之间在政治方面的共同点，而应首先指出在哲学方面的共同点，这就是胡适是杜威的崇拜者，宣扬者，而梁漱溟也是杜威的崇拜者，宣扬者。胡适称杜威是“伟大的哲学家”，梁漱溟称杜威是“伟大的学问家”，可是在这里最妙的是梁漱溟的崇拜和宣扬杜威又进一步把杜威和柏格森拉在一起，而且还说杜威和他自己“有互相发明处”。他说：“杜威的学问是由生物学来的，而我则受柏格森的影响。柏格森是生物学家。杜威说话时，说来说去离不开‘生命’，‘生命’是无所不贯串的；闭眼一想是生命，开口说话是生命，一切一切都归于生命。都归于生物进化。生物学进化观念是其学说根本。”（“梁漱溟教育论文集”）因此，他认为杜威的主要观念是生命观念。“宇宙是一大生命，了解生命就了解宇宙”。“可是有一个地方是宇宙大生命的核心，这个地方就是‘人’。生命是活的，宇宙最活的就是人心。果能体认人心，就可体认出宇宙的生命来了。”“从个体生命向上追，入了自然科学界（如心理学生理学生物学等）；从社会生命向下追，入了社会科学界。宇宙现象无非此二者而已”。因此，杜威的学问，特别是他的教育学，“能将各方面贯串一气，上下追求，四面皆通。”（“梁漱溟教育论文集”）说宇宙是一个大生命，而这个大生命的核心就是人心，认识了人心就认识了生命，认识了宇宙。这就等于说“宇宙即是吾心，吾人即是宇宙”。这完全是主观唯心主义。说从个体生命向上追就是自然科学，而从社会生命向下追就是社会科学，这就等于说自然的规律、社会的规律都是以生命作基础（当然也就是以人心作基础），都是生命发展的规律。这就是以纯生物学的观点来研究社会问题、历史问题，也就是以“生命力论”的反动观点来研究社会问题、历史问题。读者知道，这本来就是帝国主义的社会理论的基础，梁漱溟企图把蓝色魔鬼和黑色魔鬼绞混在一起来共同攻打马克思列宁主义的科学的世界观、历史观、社会观。梁漱溟无耻地宣称：“现在人类正在迷闷中，就是因为现在学术界的新风气有否认生命的趋向，……本来自达尔文学说发明以来，生命说是时行的，到处都讲，现在又不时行了。单就美国来说，杜威亦不算时髦。在我看来要人类的迷闷得以解除，须再翻一个身，打破眼前这一难关，打破反生命的风气，才能开悟出来。我是袒护杜威的；这个难关，杜威自己打不破，这并不是因他没有战斗力，是因他被困于西洋思想界，杀不出重围来。须东方来一支援兵才能杀出重围。我的精神力要是够的话，我可以帮他杀一阵。”（“梁漱溟教育论文集”）好一个杀气腾腾的梁漱溟，他之所以要把杜威柏格森化一番，他之所以要说他和杜威有互相发明之处，唯一原因就是在于以柏格森的生命力论之幽魂来唤醒杜威的实用主义的僵尸，就是在于他要作杜威的帮凶，要作杜威在东方的一支援兵，要帮他杀出重围。而他之所以要这样作，就是为了要把为帝国主义服务的新达尔文主义——物竞天择，适者生存的反动理论用之于社会科学方面来抵抗马克思列宁主义。可惜的是梁漱溟的“精神力”和柏格森的“生命力”同样是虚弱的，他的这支援兵是完全不济事的。其次是关于孔子。
    梁漱溟在“东西文化及其哲学”中称孔子为“直觉主义”者，在“中国文化要义”中又称孔子为“理性主义”者。根据梁漱溟的说法“儒家之所谓圣人，就是最能了解自己，使生命成为智慧的”，“儒家所谓‘从心所欲不逾矩’便是表示生命已成功为智慧的，——仿佛通体透明似的。”因此梁漱溟认为儒家所说的“‘天何言哉？四时行焉，百物生焉。”“致中和，天地位焉，万物育焉。”都是充分表见生命自然的意思”。正由于孔子是这样的“生命力论”者，所以孔子的“直觉主义”、“理性主义”统统是来源于生命的。由于孔子发现了人的生命中的“理性主义”而号召人们要向里用力而不要向外用力，号召人们“智慧不向外用，而返用之于自己生命，使生命成为智慧的，而非智慧为役于生命。”（“朝话”）这有什么可说的呢？在梁漱溟的生花笔下，三描五描，把孔子描绘成了典型的柏格森主义者，孔子的一切言论统统可以归之于“理性”，也就是统统可以归之于“生命”。“前圣后圣其揆一也”。梁漱溟之所以这样作，是为了用“生命力论”来对抗马克思列宁主义。我们知道，正是在这个基础之上，梁漱溟才恣情任性地描绘出孔子的“理性至上主义”如何构成了“中国文化特殊论”的“理论”，凶暴地用梁漱溟式的“孔子主义”来对抗马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。再其次是关于罗素。梁漱溟曾不断地宣称罗素是最了解中国文化特征的人。他把罗素以帝国主义代言人的身份所说的“为中国计，为世界计，以文化上之问题为最重要”称之为“深情高识”之言，竟然为之堕涕。显然罗素的这段话就是要叫中国人民恢复固有文化而长期被帝国主义统治起来。罗素的思想之所以被梁漱溟称之为“深情高识”的话，就是他认为这是和他的提倡孔子的“理性至上主义”相吻合的，这当然也是同柏格森的“生命力论”不相矛盾的。因此在梁漱溟的著作中，把他的历史观、社会观最后地完全和罗素一致起来，决不是偶然的。这种从柏格森到杜威，再从杜威到罗素的换汤不换药的办法，这都不是对于封建阶级、买办资产阶级、帝国主义有利吗？这都不是对于反马克思列宁主义有利吗？显然，只要对封建阶级、买办资产阶级和帝国主义有利的东西，只要对于反马克思列宁主义有利的东西，梁漱溟就“兼收并蓄”起来。我们的结论是，梁漱溟的哲学思想，虽然是极为混乱、极为庞杂的，但是在这里是有一条主导引线的，这就是柏格森的“生命力论”。他以此为基础，贯通了唯识学、杜威、孔子和罗素，构成了梁漱溟自己的极廉价而又极为反动的哲学体系。
