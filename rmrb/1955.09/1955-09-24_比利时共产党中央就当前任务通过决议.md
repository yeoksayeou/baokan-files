The meeting passed a resolution, pointing out some achievements in easing international tensions and strengthening world peace in the recent period, and stipulating the party's tasks in the new situation.

In this situation, it is necessary to demand that the Belgian government embark on the path of pursuing a peace-loving policy that is in the interests of the Belgian people. The Central Committee called on all party members to launch a struggle to reduce military spending and shorten the term of military service, to develop economic ties with all countries, and to recognize the People's Republic of China.

The resolution said that the Central Committee reminds Communist Party members that they must always tirelessly fight for the unity of the workers' movement and strive to meet the economic demands of the working people. In order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to raise the party's organizational and ideological work to a higher level.
