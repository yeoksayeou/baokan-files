Xinhua News Agency, September 19th—The third session of the first Beijing Municipal People's Congress opened on the 19th in the Zhongshan Hall of Zhongshan Park. A total of 480 representatives attended.

At 9:00 a.m., Mayor Peng Zhen announced the opening of the congress. After the meeting adopted the list of members of the Presidium, the Proposal Examination Committee, and the Budget and Final Accounts Examination Committee, and the agenda, Vice Mayor of Beijing Zhang Youyu gave a report on the 1954 Beijing Municipal Financial Revenue and Expenditure Final Accounts and the 1955 Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget. The report pointed out that the implementation of the 1954 financial revenue and expenditure budget was relatively good, with the total final revenue accounting for 115.48 percent of the budget and the total final expenditure accounting for 81.92 percent of the budget, resulting in a surplus of 45.74 million yuan. The income of local state-owned enterprises in 1954 exceeded the budget by 48.18 percent. This was mainly due to the fact that factories relied on all employees to improve management and reduce costs. In the 1954 final accounts, the profits paid by local state-owned enterprises, the taxes paid by state-owned and local state-owned enterprises, and the payments from cooperatives and joint state-private enterprises accounted for 75.15 percent, an increase of 7.85 percent over 1953. This situation illustrates the rapid development and growth of socialist economic components in the development of the national economy and the important role it plays in accumulating socialist construction funds for the country.

Regarding the 1955 financial revenue and expenditure budget, the report pointed out that this year's expenditure on economic construction accounts for 46.77 percent of the total expenditure, an increase of 16.69 percent over the actual expenditure in 1954; expenditure on social, cultural, and educational undertakings accounts for 37.56 percent of the total expenditure, an increase of 42.89 percent over the actual expenditure in 1954. Among them, investment in local state-owned industries has decreased somewhat compared to last year. This is because the primary task of the entire national budget in 1955 is to concentrate financial resources on developing heavy industry, and it is impossible to invest too much in local state-owned industries. At the same time, Beijing's local state-owned industries still have great production potential that has not been fully utilized, and the potential of private industries and the vast number of handicrafts has not been fully realized. In terms of education, continued measures will be taken to improve the quality of education and to develop it appropriately. This year, 33 new middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens will be built, 121 middle schools and primary schools will be expanded, and more than 41,000 new middle school and primary school students will be enrolled. Streamlining work must be carried out thoroughly in administrative organs and institutions. The streamlining work of the 42 municipal-level administrative organs has now been completed, with a reduction of 43.46 percent of the total number of personnel, of which 22 units have been reduced by about one-half. The streamlining work of affiliated organs, district-level organs, and undertakings and enterprises is underway.

The report concluded: The implementation of the budget in the first half of 1955 was not good. In terms of revenue, only 35.64 percent of the budget was completed, and expenditure was 41.2 percent of the budget. We demand that all staff members of administrative organs and undertakings and enterprises in the city mobilize together to fight for further increasing production, increasing income, practicing strict economy, overcoming waste, and improving work.

The congress also heard speeches made by Vice Mayors of Beijing Cheng Hongyi, Feng Jiping, and Wu Han at the meeting. In his speech, Cheng Hongyi said: The main task of the current grain work is to resolutely implement the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" and the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Supply of Grain in Towns and Cities" promulgated by the State Council. In order to do a good job in grain rationing, the Municipal People's Committee has decided to conduct typical experiments in Dongdan and Shijingshan districts in accordance with the methods stipulated by the State Council, in order to obtain more systematic experience and then promote it throughout the city. In his speech, Wu Han said: Beijing has made great achievements in improving the quality of education in middle and primary schools. This year, a total of more than 4,300 graduates from Beijing's high schools took the university entrance examination, and the number of passes was 67.39 percent, while last year the number of passes was only 14.36 percent. He said: The socialist consciousness of students has also been improved. The vast majority of students can actively respond to the call of the motherland's production and construction. Last winter vacation, Beijing factories and mines recruited more than 3,900 young workers, and more than 7,000 third-year junior high school students in the city applied. The phenomenon of students being late, absent, and violating study discipline has been greatly reduced, and some advanced classes have emerged in various schools. In various middle and primary schools, the number of "three good" students is also gradually increasing. Wu Han said: We must not be satisfied with the current level, but should raise our work to the highest possible standard.

    北京市人民代表大会第三次会议开幕
    据新华社十九日讯　北京市第一届人民代表大会第三次会议十九日在中山公园的中山堂开幕，出席的代表共四百八十人。
    上午九时，彭真市长宣布大会开幕。会议在通过大会主席团、提案审查委员会、预决算审查委员会委员名单和议事日程后，由北京市副市长张友渔作关于北京市一九五四年财政收支决算和一九五五年财政收支预算的报告。报告指出：一九五四年财政收支预算的执行情况比较好，决算收入总额完成预算的百分之一百一十五点四八，决算支出总额为预算的百分之八十一点九二，结余四千五百七十四万元。一九五四年地方国营企业收入超过预算百分之四十八点一八，这主要是由于各工厂依靠全体职工，改进了管理，降低了成本。在一九五四年决算的收入来源中，地方国营企业缴纳的利润、国营和地方国营企业缴纳的税款以及合作社、公私合营企业缴款占百分之七十五点一五，比一九五三年增长了百分之七点八五。这种情况说明了在国民经济发展中，社会主义经济成份的迅速发展和壮大以及它为国家积累社会主义建设资金所起的重要作用。
    关于一九五五年度财政收支预算，报告指出：今年用于经济建设的支出，占支出总额的百分之四十六点七七，比一九五四年实际支出增加百分之十六点六九；社会文教事业的支出，占支出总额的百分之三十七点五六，比一九五四年实际支出增加百分之四十二点八九。其中，地方国营工业的投资比去年减少了一些。这是因为一九五五年整个国家预算的首要任务是集中财力发展重工业，对地方国营工业的投资，不可能过多。同时，北京市的地方国营工业还有很大的生产潜力没有发挥出来，私营工业和广大的手工业也没有完全发挥了它们的潜力。在教育事业方面，继续采取各项措施，提高教育质量，并适当进行发展。今年新建中、小学、幼儿园三十三处，扩建中、小学一百二十一处，增招中、小学生四万一千多人。在行政机关和事业单位中，必须彻底进行精简工作。现在市级四十二个行政机关的精简工作已经结束，精简了的人数占总数的百分之四十三点四六，其中有二十二个单位精简了二分之一左右。附属机关、区级机关和事业、企业单位的精简工作正在进行。
    报告最后说：一九五五年上半年预算执行情况并不好。收入方面，只完成预算的百分之三十五点六四，支出为预算的百分之四十一点二。我们要求全市行政机关和事业、企业单位的全体工作人员一致动员起来，为进一步增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、克服浪费、改进工作而斗争。
    大会还听取了北京市副市长程宏毅、冯基平和吴晗在会上所作的发言。程宏毅在发言中说：当前粮食工作的主要任务，就是要坚决地贯彻执行国务院发布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”。为了把粮食定量供应工作做好，市人民委员会决定，按照国务院规定的办法，在东单、石景山两个区进行典型试验，以便取得比较系统的经验，然后在全市推行。吴晗在发言中说：北京市提高中、小学教育质量的工作已取得很大成绩。今年北京市本届高中毕业生投考高等学校的共有四千三百多人，及格人数为百分之六十七点三九，而去年及格人数只有百分之十四点三六。他说：学生的社会主义觉悟也提高了，绝大多数学生都能积极响应祖国生产建设的号召，去年寒假北京市厂矿招收青年工人共三千九百多人，全市初中三年级学生报考的有七千多人。学生中迟到、旷课和违反学习纪律的现象已大大减少，各学校都出现了一些先进的班。各中、小学校中，“三好”的学生也逐渐增多。吴晗说：我们决不能满足于目前的水平，而应该把我们的工作提高到可能的最高的标准。
