Achievements in Economic Construction in Xinjiang Region
Saifuding, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government

Since the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang in September 1949, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and thanks to the concerted efforts of the people of all ethnic groups and all cadres, and the vigorous support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, on the basis of successfully completing various social and democratic reforms, and in accordance with the general tasks of the state during the transition period, combined with the actual conditions of the Xinjiang region, great efforts have been made in economic construction. Industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production have been restored and developed, and the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved compared with before liberation, thus fundamentally changing the face of the Xinjiang region.

The agricultural areas of Xinjiang have smoothly completed land reform. In recent years, the development of socialist and semi-socialist agricultural economy has played a significant role in promoting agricultural production. At present, there are 73 state-owned farms (including those of production troops), with cultivated land accounting for 5% of the province's total cultivated area. Of the one million mu of cultivated land in state-owned and military reclamation farms, mechanically cultivated land accounts for 60%. Seventy-two tractor stations and agricultural technology promotion stations have been established, playing an active guiding and exemplary role in improving the farming techniques of farmers of all ethnic groups. 1,702 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, with 47,328 participating households, accounting for 5.3% of the total number of farm households in the province; the cultivated area accounts for 7.6% of the province's total cultivated area. Mutual aid teams have developed to 75,215, accounting for 63.32% of the total number of farm households; among them, the number of permanent mutual aid team households accounts for 28.33% of the number of participating households. The output of agricultural production cooperatives is generally about 15% higher than that of individual farmers, and some are even 20% to 30% higher than individual farmers. In the past five years, more than 2,000 large and small canals, reservoirs, and karez wells have been repaired and newly built, and more than 1,000 spring eyes have been excavated, expanding the irrigated area. The planting area of ​​crops increased by 15.09% in 1954 compared with 1950. Grain output increased by 58.09%, and yield per unit area increased by 42.22%. Cotton output increased by 1.62 times, and yield per unit area increased by 72.72%. Oilseed (including rapeseed and flax) output increased by 87.53%, and yield per unit area increased by 19.95%. At present, the province's main agricultural products, grain, cotton, and oilseed, can not only meet the needs, but also have surpluses. Hami, Yanqi, and other historically grain-deficient areas have achieved self-sufficiency after several years of increased production.

In pastoral areas, we have resolutely implemented the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class division" and protecting and developing animal husbandry, actively led and organized the broad masses of herdsmen to carry out the movement to increase and protect livestock, rationally adjusted pasture lands, mediated wage disputes between herdsmen and herdowners, improved livestock feeding management, strengthened the struggle against natural disasters, and reduced livestock mortality. In the past six years, the People's Government has issued more than 4.7 million yuan in livestock loans, solving the financial difficulties of poor herdsmen in developing production. Wolf infestation is a major enemy of the development of animal husbandry production. It is estimated that in the past, about 100,000 to 200,000 head of livestock were eaten by wolves every year, causing serious damage to herdsmen. The Party and the People's Government have taken effective measures to address this. Providing herdsmen with hunting rifles, formulating wolf hunting reward measures, and organizing wolf hunting teams have reduced wolf damage. At the same time, we have vigorously carried out veterinary disease prevention and control work in pastoral areas. According to incomplete statistics, in recent years, more than 8.8 million head of large and small livestock have been prevented and treated. At the same time, we have attached importance to the promotion of fine livestock breeds. The province has cultivated more than 33,000 Xinjiang fine-wool sheep for both wool and meat, and more than 150,000 fine hybrid livestock such as horses, cattle, and sheep are being cultivated. More than 560,000 local sheep and more than 700 horses have been hybridized and improved. The promotion of fine livestock breeds has not only improved the production and increased the income of herdsmen, but also increased raw materials for national industrial construction. State-owned ranches have been developed. At present, there are 86 state-owned ranches in the province. Three pastoral production cooperatives have been established as pilot projects, and 78 permanent mutual aid teams and more than 1,800 seasonal mutual aid teams have been established, with approximately 6,000 participating households.

Before liberation, Xinjiang had only a few small-scale, poorly equipped, and poorly managed factories and mines. Modern industry can be said to be non-existent. The Party and the People's Government attach great importance to the industrial construction of Xinjiang. In the short span of a few years after liberation, 64 factories and mines of various types have been officially put into production. The total output value of state-owned, locally state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run factories and mines in Xinjiang increased by 10.27 times in 1954 compared with 1950, of which the output value of modern industry increased by 10.18 times, and the production of means of production increased by 13.39 times. The variety of industrial products has also increased. In addition, the production and construction corps stationed in Xinjiang currently have 92 processing plants. In addition to processing their own agricultural and pastoral products, they can also process agricultural and pastoral products for people of all ethnic groups. With the development of industrial production, the total number of employees also increased by 5.3 times in 1954 compared with 1950. The number of local ethnic workers has increased significantly. According to statistics from 12 local state-owned factories and mines, ethnic employees account for 40.7% of the total number of employees.

Xinjiang's commerce was very weak before liberation. After liberation, thanks to our steady development of state-owned and cooperative commerce, and the development of trade in ethnic minority areas, we have basically met the supply of production and living materials for people of all ethnic groups, stabilized market prices, and played a significant role in promoting the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. At present, state-owned and cooperative commerce has occupied a leading position in major market towns above the county level. In the total commercial retail sales in 1954, the proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce accounted for 43.72%. In 1953, the state implemented planned purchase and planned supply of grain. Based on the situation in Xinjiang, we implemented grain planned purchase and planned supply methods basically similar to those in the interior in the three special districts of Kashgar, Shache, and Hotan in southern Xinjiang, while other special districts still adopted the method of purchasing and supplying through the market. At the same time, we have strengthened the purchase and supply of oilseeds and cotton, and gradually transformed private merchants who originally operated grain, oilseeds, and cotton into state-owned distributors and commission agents. After liberation, we restored and developed trade with the Soviet Union. The total import and export value increased by 61% in 1954 compared with 1950, of which the total export value increased by 65.1% and imports increased by 57.3%. Among the province's total export value, animal products accounted for the largest proportion, followed by agricultural products, and then local specialties. In the total import value, the proportion of means of production accounted for the largest proportion. Calculated by the total import value in 1954, means of production accounted for 79% and living materials accounted for 21%.

The development of transportation is also very rapid. In 1954, the province's total highway mileage increased by 35.59% compared with 1950, of which the mileage open to traffic increased by 90.44%. With the increase in highway mileage and the improvement of road conditions, the volume of freight has increased significantly. In addition, postal and telecommunications lines have also been greatly developed, providing convenience for the communication of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

Achievements have also been made in basic construction. From 1950 to 1954, the construction workload of various projects totaled more than 57 million yuan, of which basic industrial construction accounted for 50.33% of the total workload. With the gradual development of basic construction, the construction force has also grown significantly. Before liberation, only a few mobile seasonal workers were available in Urumqi and various special districts and counties, and they could only undertake some simple small-scale civil construction projects. Now, the basic construction force can basically meet the requirements of the province's construction tasks. The number of workers has reached more than 37,000 (including more than 29,000 installation workers). Among these workers, there are more than 5,000 technical workers in 25 types of work, and more than 500 engineering and technical personnel. This has laid a good foundation for improving basic construction work in the future.

With the gradual development of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production and the continuous expansion of the amount of social commodity circulation, Xinjiang's financial situation has fundamentally improved. Calculated on the basis of full collection and full expenditure, various incomes increased to 559 in 1954, with 1950 as 100; various expenditures increased to 113.25 in 1954, with 1950 as 100. By 1954, the financial deficit was eliminated, reaching a balance of income and expenditure, with some surplus.

As mentioned above, in the past six years, Xinjiang's economic construction has achieved tremendous achievements. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work. For example, the leadership of herdsmen's production is not strong enough; the work of surveying grasslands and cultivating pastures is not enough; the operation and management of industrial enterprises and state-owned ranches are not good; the political and ideological leadership of factories and mines is weak; the planning of basic construction work is not strong, etc. All these shortcomings must be vigorously overcome in future work.

    新疆地区经济建设的成就
    新疆省人民政府副主席  赛福鼎
    新疆自一九四九年九月和平解放以后，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，由于各族人民和全体干部的一致努力，驻新疆人民解放军的大力支援，在顺利完成各项社会民主改革的基础上，根据国家过渡时期的总任务，结合新疆地区的实际情况，大力进行了经济建设工作，工业、农业和牧业生产得到了恢复和发展，各族人民的物质和文化生活水平较之解放前有了显著提高，从而根本改变了新疆地区的面貌。
    新疆农业区已经顺利地完成了土地改革。近几年来，社会主义和半社会主义农业经济的发展，对于发展农业生产起了重大的推动作用。目前已有国营农场七十三个（包括生产部队的），耕地面积占全省总耕地面积的百分之五。在国营和军垦农场的一百万亩耕地中，机械耕作的土地已占百分之六十。建立了拖拉机站、农业技术推广站七十二个，对改进各族农民的耕作技术，起了积极的指导和示范作用。建立了农业生产合作社一千七百零二个，参加农户四万七千三百二十八户，占全省农户总数的百分之五点三；耕地面积占全省总耕地面积的百分之七点六。互助组已发展到七万五千二百一十五个，占农户总数的百分之六十三点三二；其中常年互助组的户数占入组户数百分之二十八点三三。农业生产合作社的产量一般较个体农户提高百分之十五左右，有的还比个体农户提高了百分之二十到三十。五年中整修和新修大小水渠、水库、坎儿井两千多处，掏挖泉眼一千多处，扩大了灌溉面积。农作物的种植面积，一九五四年比一九五○年增长百分之十五点零九。粮食产量增长百分之五十八点零九，单位面积产量增长百分之四十二点二二。棉花产量增长一点六二倍，单位面积产量增长百分之七十二点七二。油料（包括菜籽、胡麻两项）产量增长百分之八十七点五三，单位面积产量增长百分之十九点九五。目前，本省主要农产品粮食、棉花和油料不仅能够满足需要，而且有了剩余。哈密、焉耆等历史上的缺粮区，经过几年的增产，已达到了自给。
    我们在牧区坚决贯彻执行了不斗不分、不划阶级及保护和发展畜牧业的政策，积极领导和组织广大牧民开展了增畜保畜运动，合理地调整了牧草场，调解了牧工和牧主之间的工资纠纷，改善了牲畜的饲养管理，加强了防治自然灾害的斗争，减少了牲畜的死亡。六年中人民政府发放牧畜贷款四百七十多万元，解决了贫苦牧民在发展生产中的资金困难问题。狼害是发展畜牧业生产的大敌，估计过去每年被狼吃掉的牲畜约有十万到二十万头，给牧民带来严重的损害。党和人民政府对此采取了有效措施。供给牧民猎枪，制定了打狼奖励办法，组织打狼队，减少了狼害。同时，我们在牧区大力进行了兽疫防治工作，据不完全的统计，几年来得到预防和医治的大小牲畜有八百八十多万头。同时重视了推广优良牲畜品种，全省已培育出毛肉兼用的新疆细毛种羊三万三千多只，正在培育中的马、牛、羊等优良杂种牲畜有一十五万头以上，杂交改良的土种羊五十六万多只，马七百多匹。优良牲畜品种的推广，不但提高了牧民的生产，增加了牧民的收入，同时给国家工业建设增加了原料。发展了国营牧场，目前全省已有国营牧场八十六个，重点试办了三个牧业生产合作社，建立了常年互助组七十八个，季节性互助组一千八百多个，参加户数约为六千户。
    解放前，新疆只有几个规模很小、设备简陋、经营管理非常落后的厂矿，现代化的工业可以说没有。党和人民政府十分重视新疆的工业建设。在解放后短短的几年中，前后已有各种类型的六十四个厂矿正式投入了生产。新疆地区的国营、地方国营、公私合营、合作社营厂矿的生产总值一九五四年比一九五○年增长了十点二七倍，其中现代工业产值增长十点一八倍，生产资料的生产，增长十三点三九倍。工业产品的品种也有增加。此外，驻新疆的生产建设部队目前还有加工厂九十二个，他们除加工自己的农牧产品外，还可以为各族人民的农牧产品进行加工。随着工业生产的发展，职工总数一九五四年也较一九五○年增加了五点三倍。本地民族工人已有很大增长。根据地方国营十二个厂矿的统计，民族职工已占职工总数的百分之四十点七。
    新疆的商业，在解放以前是很薄弱的。解放以后，由于我们稳步地发展了国营和合作社商业，开展了民族地区的贸易工作，基本上满足了各族人民生产和生活资料的供应，稳定了市场物价，对于促进工、农、牧业生产的发展起了很大的作用。目前国营和合作社商业已在主要县城以上市场占了领导地位。在一九五四年商业零售总额中，国营和合作社商业的比重已占百分之四十三点七二。一九五三年，国家对粮食实行计划收购和计划供应；我们根据新疆地区的情况，在南疆的喀什、莎车、和阗三个专区实行了同内地基本上相似的粮食计划收购和计划供应办法，其他各专区则仍采取通过市场进行收购和供应的办法。同时，对油料、棉花也加强了收购和供应工作，并将原来经营粮食、油料和棉花的私商逐步改造成为国家的经销、代销店。解放后，我们恢复和发展了对苏贸易。进出口总值一九五四年比一九五○年增长百分之六十一，其中出口总值增长百分之六十五点一，进口增长百分之五十七点三。本省出口总值中，占比重最大的是畜产品，其次是农产品，再次是土特产品。在进口总值中，生产资料占的比重最大，以一九五四年的进口总值计算，生产资料占百分之七十九，生活资料占百分之二十一。
    交通运输事业的发展也是很快的。一九五四年全省公路里程比一九五○年增长百分之三十五点五九，其中通车里程增长百分之九十点四四。随着公路通车里程的增长，路况的改善，货运量有了显著增加。此外，邮政、电讯线路也有了很大的发展，使新疆各族人民的通讯获得了便利。
    基本建设事业也获得了成绩，从一九五○年到一九五四年共完成各项事业的建筑工作量五万七千多元，其中工业的基本建设占工作总量的百分之五十点三三。随着基本建设事业的逐渐发展，建筑力量也有了很大的增长。解放前，乌鲁木齐市和各专区、县只有少数流动的季节性的工人，他们只能承建一些简单的小型的土木建筑工程。而现在的基本建设力量已基本上可以满足本省建筑任务的要求，工人的数量已达三万七千多人（其中安装工人二万九千多人），在这些工人中有二十五个工种的技术工人五千多人，工程技术人员五百多人。这就为今后提高基本建设工作打下了良好的基础。
    随着工、农、牧业生产的逐渐发展和社会商品流转额的不断扩大，新疆省的财政状况有了根本的好转。以满收满支计算，各项收入以一九五○年为一百，一九五四年增为五百五十九；各项支出，以一九五○年为一百，一九五四年增为一百一十三点二五。到一九五四年就消灭了财政赤字，达到收支平衡，并有若干结余。
    如上所述，六年来，新疆的经济建设工作已经获得了巨大的成绩。但是，我们的各项工作中还有不少缺点。例如对牧民的生产领导还不强；勘测草原、培殖草场等工作做得不够；工业企业和国营牧场的经营管理不善；厂矿企业的政治思想领导薄弱；基本建设工作的计划性不强，等等。所有这些缺点，都亟须在今后的工作中大力克服。
