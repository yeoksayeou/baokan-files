Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 21st. According to the "Freies Volk" newspaper on the 18th, Max Reimann, First Secretary of the German Communist Party, addressed five hundred party cadres and workers in Düsseldorf, pointing out the necessity of the struggle against militarism. He said: "The question of opposing German militarism and guaranteeing security is the primary task of the people of Europe, and first and foremost, the German people."

Reimann pointed out that the task of Communists is to stand at the forefront of the working class and fight for the social welfare of the workers, and to explain to the workers that the hardships in their lives are caused by the West German government's policy of military expansion. He said that nearly four million workers and staff in West Germany are currently participating in the movement to demand wage increases, which is a blow to the militarists' policy of rearmament.

Reimann said that Communists must explain to the working masses that the Bonn state is a state of monopoly capitalists, big landlords, and militarists. Defending the legal rights of the German Communist Party, supporting imprisoned patriots and peace fighters, and fighting for the establishment of democratic conditions in West Germany are the tasks of the West German working class. The unification of Germany depends on the struggle of West Germany against militarism and its supporters - monopoly capitalists and big landlords.

Reimann pointed out that in order to achieve victory, the working class must act in unison and fight together with the laboring peasants.

    雷曼号召西德工人加紧反对德国军国主义
    新华社柏林二十一日讯　据“自由人民报”十八日消息：德国共产党第一书记雷曼在杜塞尔多夫向五百名党的干部和工人讲话，指出反军国主义斗争的必要性。他说：“反对德国军国主义、保障安全的问题是目前欧洲人民，首先是德国人民的主要任务。”
    雷曼指出，共产党员的任务就是站在工人阶级的前列为工人的社会福利而斗争，并且向工人说明生活困苦是因为西德政府实行扩军政策所造成的。他说：目前西德有近四百万职工参加了要求增加工资的运动，这是对军国主义者的重新武装的政策的一个打击。
    雷曼说，共产党员必须向工人群众说明：波恩国家是独占资本家、大地主和军国主义者的国家。保卫德国共产党的合法权利，声援被监禁的爱国者与和平战士，为在西德建立民主条件而斗争是西德工人阶级的任务。德国的统一取决于西德反对军国主义及其拥护者——独占资本家和大地主的斗争。
    雷曼指出：为了取得胜利，工人阶级必须一致行动并且与劳动农民共同进行斗争。
