The great day of September 3, 1945, the victory over Japanese imperialism, is unforgettable for the people of Asian countries. Today, as we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we gratefully remember the Soviet Union's decisive contribution to this historic victory.

In May 1945, as the Soviet army crushed the main military force of Hitler in Europe, Nazi Germany declared unconditional surrender, which confirmed the fate of the defeat of Japanese imperialism. However, if the Soviet Union had not sent troops, the war in the Far East would not have ended in a short period of time. At that time, although the American and British forces had been fighting against Japan in the Pacific theater for more than three years, they had not dealt a fatal blow to Japan. The Japanese fascist warlords still possessed millions of troops (including the most elite Kwantung Army, which had not been put into battle), they refused to lay down their weapons, and prepared to use Northeast China and Korea as their rear to carry out a "decisive battle on the mainland" and pinned their final hopes on a "long-term war" on the continent. The Japanese fascist general Araki once said: "Even if the Japanese islands are reduced to ashes, we will still fight on the continent."

Because the American and British forces were afraid of suffering heavy casualties in landing on the Japanese mainland, they adopted a policy of delaying the war. According to their Pacific war plan, victory over Japan was still far away. At that time, the American "Outlook" magazine reported that the American Joint Chiefs of Staff expected to end the Far East war in 1946 or 1947, or even 1949. The American "Life" magazine estimated: "It will take fourteen years for American troops to reach Tokyo." On July 29, 1945, U.S. President Truman, in a conversation with reporters from the "Stars and Stripes," pessimistically stated: "If Japan does not accept the final announcement by the Allies urging it to surrender, it is truly unknown when the war will end."

At the same time, the Far East "Munich" elements of the United States and Britain took advantage of the slow progress of the war against Japan to carry out activities, conspiring to sacrifice the fundamental interests of the people of Asian countries and compromise with Japanese imperialism.

Under such circumstances, the Soviet Union, in accordance with the agreement of the Yalta Conference, declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945. This action completely shattered the conspiracy of the Far East "Munich," changed the course of the Far East war, and won the warm cheers of the people of Asian countries who were resisting Japanese imperialism.

In the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people, through arduous and extremely heroic struggles, made their own great sacrifices and made the greatest contribution to the sacred cause of defeating Japanese imperialism. The Soviet Union's declaration of war was a great encouragement and assistance to the Chinese people. Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, published the article "The Last Battle Against the Japanese Invaders" on the second day of the Soviet Union's declaration of war. He pointed out: "Due to this action by the Soviet Union, the time for the war against Japan will be greatly shortened. The war against Japan is in its final stage, and the time for finally defeating the Japanese aggressors and all their running dogs has come."

Facts quickly confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion. The powerful Soviet army, with the force of thunder, launched a full-scale offensive on the land and sea front of more than 4,000 kilometers from Lake Baikal to the Primorsky Krai. In just over ten days, the Soviet army defeated the main force of the Japanese army—the million-strong Kwantung Army known as "invincible"—and, in coordination with the Chinese People's Army, liberated Northeast China. Subsequently, it liberated Korea, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands. The main force on which the Japanese aggressors relied was eliminated, and its military fortress and economic supply base in Northeast China were destroyed, which completely turned the plans of the Japanese fascist warlords for a "decisive battle on the mainland" and a "long-term war" on the continent into a complete illusion. Therefore, Japan accepted unconditional surrender, and the joint forces of the Allied countries fighting against Japan finally won the final victory.

Certain historical falsifiers of imperialism attempt to obliterate the decisive role of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops in prompting Japan's surrender. They purposefully propagate that the decisive force in defeating Japan seems to be the American atomic bomb bombings of Japan. This statement is groundless and not worth refuting. Everyone knows that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in addition to inhumanely destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people, did not cause any damage to Japan's military power. At that time, James Rowe, an intelligence expert in the U.S. military, admitted: "The dropping of the atomic bomb did not persuade those Japanese warlords that the war to defend the motherland was impossible." Lord Mountbatten, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, said: "It is a great mistake to think that the atomic bomb would stop the Far East war." On August 9, 1950, the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Jiji Shinpo" also pointed out: "The Soviet Union's action forced the Japanese military group to decide to surrender after they had resisted when they faced the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima. ... From the results, the Soviet Union's action had a huge impact on achieving peace."

The great victory of the Soviet Union's defeat of Japanese imperialism is of historical significance. Together with the Chinese people and the anti-fascist people of various countries fighting against Japan, it eliminated the source of war in the Far East, restored universal peace in Asia, and led to the end of World War II. This victory changed the entire situation in Asia and the Pacific, opening up a new era for millions of peace-loving people.

The great victory over Japanese imperialism greatly encouraged the movement of Asian countries to fight for national independence and created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the victorious development of this movement. The vast people of Asia, who had long suffered from colonial rule and foreign aggression, are increasingly awakened, and they are rising up with unparalleled strength to fight for freedom and liberation. It was under such historical conditions that the Chinese people's revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party, won victory after a long period of struggle. The Chinese people deeply understand that the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 greatly strengthened the world peace and democracy camp, and at the same time, it was a victory for the world peace and democracy forces headed by the Soviet Union. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "If there were no Soviet Union, if there were no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese imperialism had not been defeated, if the new democratic countries had not emerged, if the oppressed nations of the East were not rising up to fight, if the struggle between the masses of the people and the reactionaries who rule them inside the capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, if all these were not combined, then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would certainly be many times greater than they are now. In this situation, could we have won? Obviously not."

Because the Soviet army drove Japanese imperialism out of the land of Korea, the Korean people embarked on the road of national revival and democratic development. The young Democratic People's Republic of Korea was born. The victory of the Soviet Union's defeat of Japanese imperialism greatly contributed to the success of the Vietnamese people's August Revolution. The young Democratic Republic of Vietnam was born. At the same time, in the post-war years, the movement of the people of Southeast Asian countries against colonial rule and for national independence has also developed vigorously. Countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia have already broken free from colonial shackles and gained independent status. The people of Asian countries are determined to be masters of their own lives and destinies, to defend their independence and freedom, and to play an increasingly important role in the cause of consolidating world peace. All of this reflects the tremendous changes in the post-war situation in Asia.

However, the U.S. ruling group refuses to face the lessons of the defeat of Japanese imperialism and the reality of Asia. It has taken the place of Japanese imperialism and is actively supporting the revival of Japanese militarist forces. The United States desperately opposes the independence and freedom of the people of Asian countries, threatens the peace and security of Asia, and its purpose is to turn Asia into its vast colony and a breeding ground for another world war. This policy is fundamentally contrary to the vital interests of the people of Asian countries, and it is doomed to failure.

For ten years, the Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts and made effective contributions to defend the fruits of victory of World War II and to maintain peace and security in the Far East. Together with the Soviet Union, China, and the peace forces of Asian countries, it has stopped the Korean War and the Indochina War launched by imperialism, and has promoted some easing of tensions in Asia. Together with the Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving countries in Asia, it insists that countries in Asia and the Pacific region establish and develop international trust and cooperation on the basis of peaceful coexistence in order to ensure the safety and prosperity of the lives of the people of all countries. Today, the people of Asian countries have seen that they have achieved great victories in their struggle for peace and progress. They are increasingly strengthening their unity and confidently pushing the historical wheels of Asia to continue to advance along the road of peace and progress.

    苏联击溃日本帝国主义的历史意义
    崔奇
    一九四五年九月三日战胜日本帝国主义的伟大日子，是亚洲各国人民永志不忘的。今天，在纪念抗日战争胜利十周年的时候，我们怀着感激的心情想到苏联在这个历史性的胜利中有决定意义的贡献。
    一九四五年五月，由于苏联军队在欧洲粉碎了希特勒的主要军事力量，法西斯德国宣告无条件投降，这就肯定了日本帝国主义失败的命运。但是，如果苏联不出兵，远东的战争在短时期内还不会结束。那时，在太平洋战场上，美英军队对日作战虽然已经三年多，却没有给日本以致命的打击。日本法西斯军阀仍然拥有数百万陆军（其中最精锐的关东军一直没有投入战斗），他们拒绝放下武器，而准备以中国东北和朝鲜作后方，进行“本土决战”，并把最后希望寄托在大陆上的“长期战争”。日本法西斯将领荒木曾说过：“即使日本三岛化为灰烬，我们仍将在大陆作战。”
    美英军队由于害怕登陆日本本土会遭受重大牺牲，就采取了拖延战争的政策。按照他们的太平洋作战计划，战胜日本依然遥遥无期。当时，美国“展望”周刊曾报道，美国参谋长联席会议指望在一九四六年或者一九四七年甚至一九四九年结束远东战争。美国“生活”杂志估计：“美国军队到达东京需要十四年。”一九四五年七月二十九日，美国总统杜鲁门向“星条报”记者发表谈话时，更悲观地表示：“日本如不接受盟方促使它投降的最后公告，真不知战争将在那天结束。”
    同时，美英的远东“慕尼黑”分子更利用对日作战进展缓慢的机会进行活动，阴谋牺牲亚洲各国人民的根本利益，和日本帝国主义妥协。
    在这样的形势下，苏联根据雅尔达会议的协议，于一九四五年八月八日向日本宣战了。这个行动彻底粉碎了远东“慕尼黑”的阴谋，改变了远东战争的进程，它获得了正在抗击日本帝国主义的亚洲各国人民的热烈欢呼。
    中国人民在八年抗日战争中，经过了艰苦卓绝和无比英勇的奋斗，付出了自己的巨大牺牲，为击败日本帝国主义的神圣事业作出了最多的贡献。苏联的宣战是对中国人民的极大鼓舞和援助。中国人民领袖毛泽东同志在苏联宣战的第二天发表了“对日寇的最后一战”的文章，他指出：“由于苏联这一行动，对日战争的时间将大大缩短。对日战争已处在最后阶段，最后地战胜日本侵略者及其一切走狗的时间已经到来了。”
    事实很快地证实了毛泽东同志的论断。强大的苏联军队以雷霆万钧之势，在从外贝加尔湖到滨海区四千多公里的陆上战线和海上，发动了全面的进攻。仅仅十几天的时间，苏联军队就打垮了日本陆军的主力——号称“无敌”的百万关东军，并在中国人民军队的配合作战下，解放了中国东北。接着又解放了朝鲜、库页岛和千岛群岛。日本侵略者所依靠的主要力量被消灭了，它在中国东北的军事堡垒和经济供应基地被摧毁了，这就使得日本法西斯军阀的“本土决战”和大陆“长期战争”的计划完全化为泡影。因此，日本接受了无条件投降，对日作战的盟国的联合力量终于获得了最后胜利。
    帝国主义的某些历史伪造者企图抹煞苏联出兵促使日本投降的决定性作用。他们别有用心地宣传说，战胜日本的决定性力量似乎是美国对日本的原子弹轰炸。这种说法是毫无根据，不值一驳的。谁都知道，投在广岛和长崎的原子弹除了惨无人道地毁灭了几十万无辜人民的生命以外，并没有给日本的军事力量造成什么打击。当时，美国军部情报专家杰姆斯罗威就承认：“原子弹的投掷并未说服那些日本军阀们，使他们认为保卫祖国战争是不可能的。”英国东南亚盟军最高总司令蒙巴顿说过：“认为原子弹会停止远东战争，是一个最大的错误。”一九五○年八月九日，日本资产阶级报纸“时事新报”也指出：“苏联的行动，迫使日本军事集团在他们面临原子弹攻击广岛时还进行抵抗之后决定投降。……从结果看来，苏联的行动在实现和平上有着巨大的影响。”
    苏联击溃日本帝国主义的伟大胜利是具有历史意义的。它和中国人民以及对日作战的反法西斯各国人民一起，消灭了远东的战争策源地，恢复了亚洲的普遍和平，并导致了第二次世界大战的结束。这个胜利改变了整个亚洲和太平洋的形势，给千百万爱好和平的人民开辟了一个新的时代。
    战胜日本帝国主义的伟大胜利，大大地鼓舞了亚洲各国人民争取民族独立的运动，并给这个运动的胜利发展创造了空前有利的条件。长期遭受殖民统治和外国侵略的亚洲广大人民日益觉醒，他们以无可比拟的力量起来争取自由解放。就在这样的历史条件下，在共产党领导下，经过长期奋斗的中国人民革命获得了胜利。中国人民深深懂得，一九四九年中华人民共和国的成立，大大加强了世界和平民主阵营，同时它也就是以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的胜利。毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中说：“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争，假如没有美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本等等资本主义国家内部的人民大众和统治他们的反动派之间的斗争，假如没有这一切的综合，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利吗？显然是不能的。”
    由于苏联军队从朝鲜的土地上赶走了日本帝国主义，朝鲜人民走上了民族复兴和民主发展的道路。年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国诞生了。苏联击溃日本帝国主义的胜利，大大有助于越南人民八月革命的成功。年轻的越南民主共和国诞生了。同时，在战后的年代里，东南亚各国人民反对殖民统治、争取民族独立的运动也有了蓬勃的发展。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国已经摆脱了殖民枷锁，获得了独立地位。亚洲各国人民决心要做自己生活和命运的主人，保卫自己的独立和自由，并在巩固世界和平的事业中发挥日益重要的作用。所有这些都反映了战后亚洲局势的巨大变化。
    但是，美国统治集团不肯正视日本帝国主义失败的教训和亚洲的现实。它代替了日本帝国主义的地位，并积极扶植日本军国主义势力复活。美国拼命反对亚洲各国人民的独立自由，威胁亚洲的和平与安全，其目的是要把亚洲变为它的广大殖民地和另一次世界大战的策源地。这种政策同亚洲各国人民的切身利益是根本抵触的，它注定是要失败的。
    十年以来，苏联为了保卫第二次世界大战的胜利成果，为了维护远东的和平与安全，进行了坚持不懈的努力，做出了有成效的贡献。苏联、中国和亚洲各国的和平力量一起，制止了帝国主义所发动的朝鲜战争和印度支那战争，并促使亚洲紧张局势有了一些缓和。苏联、中国和亚洲爱好和平国家一起，坚持主张亚洲及太平洋区域各国在和平共处的基础上建立和发展国际间的信任和合作，以保证各国人民生活的安全和繁荣。今天，亚洲各国人民都看到，他们在争取和平与进步的斗争中已经获得伟大胜利。他们正日益加强团结，满怀信心地推动亚洲的历史车轮继续沿着和平与进步的道路前进。
