The reconstruction project of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is nearing completion, and production preparations are being intensified. The production preparation for the Model 1A62 machine tool is currently the central task of the plant's production preparations. This machine tool is a new product that Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant will mass-produce, and it is a working mother machine that the Chinese machinery industry needs in large quantities. The plant's tool workshop began manufacturing tools and fixtures for the production of this machine tool in October of last year after the installation project was completed; to date, more than 1,600 types of tools and fixtures have been made. Foundry workers in the foundry workshop have also cast more than 50 machine tool beds and various parts to ensure the production needs of this machine tool.

In the production preparation work, the employees of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant actively learned new operating technologies and management experience. In the first half of this year, the plant formed seventeen types of classes to specifically learn operating techniques from Soviet experts. After each lecture by the Soviet experts, they went to the workshop to personally teach each person how to operate. With the help of Soviet experts, the plant's employees have gradually mastered the new technology. For example, some workers in the 1A62 workshop have now relatively skillfully mastered the operating techniques of special machine tools such as linkage boring machines, deep hole drilling machines, and guideway grinders, laying the foundation for future formal production. They are now carrying out small-batch production in order to further familiarize themselves with the process regulations and improve their operational skills.

The construction section, which is responsible for formulating and revising mechanical processing procedures, has reviewed and revised the process regulations for some products that have been produced in the past and will continue to be produced in the future, based on advanced Soviet experience and the rebuilt machine tool equipment, in order to further improve product quality and production efficiency.

    改建的沈阳第一机床厂加紧进行生产准备
    沈阳第一机床厂的改建工程快要完工，现在正在加紧进行生产准备工作。一A六二型机床的生产准备工作，是目前这个厂生产准备工作的中心任务。这种机床是沈阳第一机床厂将要大批生产的一种新的产品，是中国机械工业大量需要的一种工作母机。这个厂的工具车间从去年十月结束安装工程以后，就开始制造生产这种机床用的工具和卡具；到目前为止，已做出了工具和卡具一千六百多种。铸工车间的翻砂工人也铸出五十多台机床床身和各种部件，以保证这种机床的生产需要。
    沈阳第一机床厂职工在生产准备工作中积极学习了新的操作技术和管理经验。今年上半年全厂组成了十七种班，专门向苏联专家学习操作技术。苏联专家每次讲课后，再到车间亲手教每人操作。在苏联专家的帮助下，这个厂的职工已逐渐掌握了新的技术。如一A六二车间的一部分工人，现已比较熟练地掌握了联动镗床、深孔钻床和导轨磨床等特种机床的操作技术，为将来的正式生产打下了基础。他们现在正在进行小批生产，以便进一步熟悉工艺规程，提高操作技术水平。
    负责制定和修改机械加工工艺规程的施工科，根据苏联先进经验和改建后的机床设备情况，对过去曾经生产过、今后还要继续生产的一些产品的工艺规程，进行了审查和修改，以便进一步提高产品质量和生产效率。（新华社）
