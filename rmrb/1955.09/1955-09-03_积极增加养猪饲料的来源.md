    Actively Increase Sources of Pig Feed

    Editor:
    The Xinguang Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Metou Town, Metou District, Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, uses various feeds to raise pigs. The pigs in the cooperative are fed so well that they are fat and big, with round bellies. In the first half of this year alone, they sold 322 pigs to the state, most of which were of the first three grades. When nearby farmers saw the pigs in the cooperative, they all said they were "even better than those fed with fine grains."
    The cooperative uses dozens of kinds of feed for raising pigs, but the main practices are in five categories. I will now introduce them to you:
    1. Peanut Shells: First, crush the peanut shells with a mill or other tools (the finer the better), then sift them finely with a sieve and mix them into other feed to feed the pigs.
    2. Corn Cobs: After the corn is removed from the corn stalks, crush and grind the stalks finely. This substitute feed is best made and fed to the pigs as soon as the corn is harvested. If the pigs cannot finish eating it, dry it and store it.
    3. Carrots: Wash off the dirt with clean water, pick out the impurities, and then chop them finely together with the carrot greens. Put them in a pot and cook them. Then use them as the main feed, appropriately mixed with other feeds, to feed the pigs.
    4. Sunflower Seed Cakes: After the sunflower seeds are removed, wash the seed cakes, chop them up, put them in a pot to cook, and after boiling, they can be fed to the pigs.
    5. Green fodder such as green grass, sweet potato vines, oak leaves, and pumpkin flowers should have impurities removed, washed, and chopped finely. Green fodder should not be exposed to sunlight, otherwise the nutrients will be lost.
    In addition to the above, the cooperative is also preparing to make fermented feed and "raw-cooked carrots." The method of making fermented feed is: put all kinds of washed and chopped green fodder into a large vat, step on it as tightly as possible, then cover it with a large stone, and pour in clean water (slightly higher than the stone by two inches). The method of making "raw-cooked carrots" is: first wash the carrots, dry them in a shady place until half dry, then chop them finely with a knife, put them in a vat, and tamp them dry (do not add water), and finally add a large stone to cover it tightly. Feed stored using these two methods can be preserved until the turn of spring and summer of the following year, and the nutritional value will not be reduced at all.
    Using these feeds to raise pigs can save a large amount of grain for the country, solve the difficulty of insufficient feed supply, reduce the cost of raising pigs, and increase farmers' income. Facts have proved that as long as you are careful and attentive when using these feeds to raise pigs, it will absolutely not affect the pigs' fatness. Therefore, I hope that the relevant leading authorities in various places will educate the farmers raising pigs to establish the idea of "self-sourced feed as the main source and commercial feed as a supplement," widely adopt substitute feed for raising pigs, and try to save a large amount of grain for the country to support socialist industrialization.

### 积极增加养猪饲料的来源

    积极增加养猪饲料的来源编辑同志：
    江苏如皋县么头区么头镇新光第二农业生产合作社利用各种饲料养猪，社里的猪都喂得又肥又大，肚皮滚圆。仅仅今年上半年，他们就卖给国家三百二十二头生猪，绝大部分都是前三等的。附近农民看到了社里的猪子以后，都说是“比用细粮喂的还好”。
    这个社养猪用的饲料共有好几十种，但做法主要有五类，现在我向大家介绍一下：
    一，花生壳：先把花生壳用磨子或其他器具碾碎（越碎越好），然后用细箩筛筛细，拌到其它饲料里喂猪。
    二，玉米头（即玉蜀黍棒）：玉蜀黍剥去玉米后，把棒碾碎磨细。这种代饲料最好在玉蜀黍刚收下就做了喂猪，猪子吃不完时再吹干贮藏。
    三，胡萝卜：用清水洗去泥土、拣去杂质后，连同萝卜缨子一起用刀切细，放进锅里煮熟，然后把它作为主饲品，适当掺些其他饲料一起给猪吃。
    四，向日葵饼子：向日葵剥去瓜子以后，把饼子洗净切碎，放到锅里去煮，开锅后就可以喂猪。
    五，青草、山芋藤、柞树叶、蕃瓜花等一类的青饲料，拣去杂质，洗净切细就行了；青饲料不可以经阳光晒，否则养分就会受到损失。
    除了以上所介绍的以外，最近这个社还准备做发酵饲料和“生煮胡萝卜”。发酵饲料的做法是：将洗净切好的各种青饲料放进一个大缸里，用脚踩得越紧越好，然后盖上大石头，再浇上清水（略高于石头二寸）。“生煮胡萝卜”的做法是：先将胡萝卜洗净，放在背阴处吹成半干，再用刀切细，放进缸里，用脚干踏（不可放水），最后加上大石头盖严。用这两种方法贮藏的饲料，可以保存到第二年春夏之交，营养价值丝毫不会减少。
    采用这些饲料喂猪，既可以为国家节约大批粮食，解决饲料供应不足的困难，又可以降低养猪成本，增加农民的收入。事实证明，用这些饲料养猪只要谨慎、细心一些，是绝对不会影响猪子肥膘的。因此，我希望各地有关领导机关教育养猪的农民确立“自找饲料为主、商品饲料为辅”的思想，广泛采用代饲料养猪，设法为国家节约大量粮食，支援社会主义工业化。
