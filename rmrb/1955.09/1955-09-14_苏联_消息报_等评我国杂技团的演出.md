The performances of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, currently visiting Moscow, have aroused great interest among Muscovites. On the 10th, both "Izvestia" and "Labor News" published articles commenting on the performances of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, unanimously believing that the performances were a delightful event in Moscow's cultural life and a testament to the progress of Chinese art in serving the people.

The commentary written by Monsone published in "Izvestia" stated that Chinese acrobatics have reached a state of perfection. The astonishing agility and skillful, perfect movements that win the audience's admiration are the result of many years of hard training.

The article particularly praised Wang Wenjie, Dong Fengwu, and others for their wonderful "plate spinning" performances, Zhou Zhicheng's highly skilled ventriloquism, He Shuwang and his partner Zhou Jinrong's amazing jar balancing act, as well as the wonderful and moving performances of many other actors.

The article emphasized that elegance and nobility are the characteristics of Chinese acrobats. Even the most complex and difficult performances demonstrate high artistic achievement and youthful and joyful temperament.

The famous Soviet acrobat and Honored Artist of the Russian Federation, Kiok, wrote in an article in "Labor News" that the performances of Chinese acrobats are breathtaking. While praising the skills of the Chinese acrobats, Kiok particularly emphasized that Chinese acrobatics are derived from genuine folk acrobatics and do not copy or repeat foreign acrobatics.

Kiok also talked about the progress of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe since its first performance in the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet audience is very happy to see this progress.
