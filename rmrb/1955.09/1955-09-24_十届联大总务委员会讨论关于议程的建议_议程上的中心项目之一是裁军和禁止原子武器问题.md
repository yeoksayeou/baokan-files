Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 23rd: According to TASS, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met on the 21st to discuss recommendations to the General Assembly regarding the agenda for the tenth session.

    The General Committee adopted part of the agenda, including sixty-eight items. One of the central items on the agenda is the report submitted by the United Nations Disarmament Commission on "regulating, limiting, and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments, and concluding an international convention (treaty) on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction."

    This session will also discuss the report submitted by the United Nations Secretary-General on the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva in August.

    The General Committee also decided to recommend that the General Assembly include items such as assistance to underdeveloped and economically backward countries, the issue of racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa, and the issue of non-self-governing territories on the agenda.

    The representative of the Union of South Africa opposed the inclusion of the issue of racial conflict in South Africa and the status of residents of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa on the agenda. He insisted that discussing such issues would mean interfering in the internal affairs of his country. However, the committee still recommended that the General Assembly include this issue on the agenda.

    The General Committee discussed the issue raised by the Greek delegation of including the Cyprus issue on the agenda of the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    British representative Nutting expressed opposition to this suggestion. He said that this was not a question of self-determination for the residents of Cyprus, but a question of Greece wanting to annex Cyprus. In response to Nutting, Greek representative Miras emphasized that the Greek residents of Cyprus are demanding the right to self-determination. The reason Greece raised this issue at the United Nations is because the residents of Cyprus have no representation here.

    Soviet representative Kuznetsov insisted on including the Cyprus issue on the agenda of the General Assembly. Kuznetsov said: The committee's discussion shows that this issue should attract the most serious attention and should be considered by the current session of the General Assembly. The Charter stipulates that the United Nations has the right to discuss this issue and make recommendations, which will help enhance the prestige of the United Nations. Kuznetsov emphasized that, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has the right to grant self-determination to Cyprus. Therefore, the Soviet delegation supports the Greek proposal to include the Cyprus issue on the agenda of the tenth session of the General Assembly.

    This suggestion was not adopted for inclusion on the agenda. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Mexico, and Egypt voted in favor of including this issue on the agenda; representatives from the United States, Britain, and France, and seven other delegations voted against; and representatives from Thailand and Ethiopia, and four other delegations abstained.

    十届联大总务委员会讨论关于议程的建议
    议程上的中心项目之一是裁军和禁止原子武器问题
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会二十一日开会，会上讨论了向大会提出的关于第十届会议议程的建议。
    总务委员会通过了一部分议程，其中包括六十八个项目。议程上的中心项目之一，就是联合国裁军委员会就“规定、限制并且均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备、缔结一项关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）”提出的报告。
    这届会议还将讨论联合国秘书长就八月间在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议提出的报告。
    总务委员会还决定建议大会把援助未开发的和经济上落后的国家问题、南非联邦的种族歧视问题、非自治领土问题等项目列入议程。
    南非联邦代表反对把南非的种族冲突问题和南非联邦中印度人血统的居民的地位问题列入议程。他硬说讨论这样的问题就意味着干涉他的国家的内政。然而委员会还是建议大会把这项问题列入议程。
    总务委员会讨论了希腊代表团所提出的把塞浦路斯问题列入联合国大会第十届会议议程的问题。
    英国代表纳丁对这个建议表示反对。他说，这不是塞浦路斯居民要求自决的问题，而是希腊要并吞塞浦路斯的问题。希腊代表米拉斯在答复纳丁时着重指出：塞浦路斯的希腊居民要求有自决权。希腊所以在联合国提出这个问题，是因为塞浦路斯居民在这里没有代表。
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫坚持把塞浦路斯问题列入大会议程。库兹涅佐夫说：委员会的讨论显示了这个问题应该引起最认真的注意，并且应该由大会本届会议加以考虑。宪章规定，联合国有权讨论这个问题和提出建议，这样将有助于提高联合国的威望。库兹涅佐夫强调：按照联合国宪章，联合国有权给塞浦路斯以自决权。因此苏联代表团支持希腊提出的把塞浦路斯问题列入大会第十届会议议程。
    这个建议没有被通过列入议程。苏联、波兰、墨西哥和埃及的代表投票赞成把这个问题列入议程；美国、英国和法国等七个代表团投票反对；泰国和埃塞俄比亚等四个代表团弃权。
