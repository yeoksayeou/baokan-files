    America's Self-Confession

    While the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries are doing everything possible to strengthen trust between nations, the United States is massively training secret agents, preparing to airdrop them into these countries to carry out subversive activities. The "New York Times" article by Anthony Leviero from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is America's self-confession of training airdropped agents.

    From Anthony Leviero's report, it can be seen that this secret agent force is composed of a mixture of traitors, national sell-outs, and American agents. Leviero said: In the swamps and deep mountains of North Carolina, he had seen this "special force." "The first impression is: they are all foreigners." Leviero said that many of them were so-called "refugees from communist countries," and "sergeants shouted commands in Polish, Czech, Russian, German, or other languages." In addition, there were also many "Americans who are preparing to undertake probably the most arduous mission in military history" in this "special force." This is a group of desperadoes. Some are retired officers, and some are so-called "adventurous youths."

    According to Leviero's report, these secret agents first receive parachute training and then "serve in the special forces." The members of this "special force" are all "proficient in various weapons from pistols to 105mm recoilless rifles," and each one is an "expert" and "technician," including "linguists, demolition experts, radio operators, and very skilled non-professional medical personnel." They are all undergoing "extremely rigorous" training and must be "trained to be rude, strong, and cunning."

    After completing their training, this group of vicious secret agents will be airdropped into peaceful, democratic countries to engage in sabotage and subversive activities. According to Leviero's report, these secret agents "will be parachuted into the enemy's rear" to participate in the so-called "guerrilla teams" organized by counter-revolutionaries in these countries, "helping these organizations from within" to attack the democratic regimes there. Leviero specifically mentioned that this "concept of airborne secret agent force came from the bitter experience of the Korean War." This is a very interesting confession. Because everyone knows that during the Korean War, China arrested many spies of Chinese and American nationality sent by the United States, and the United States once tried to deny it.

    Leviero's report makes it clear that the training of secret agents is not only taking place in the United States, but also around the world. Leviero said that in Fort Bragg is the "77th Special Forces Group - Airborne Division," and "in Germany is the 10th Group." This "force" is very large. According to Leviero, a detachment of a "special force" usually has about two thousand people. Leviero did not specifically mention the situation of the United States training secret agents in Asia. However, the fact that the American "Western Enterprise Company" is training Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in Taiwan is already well known. Leviero also pointed out that, as far as the Far East is concerned, the US training plan is to realize "let Asians fight Asians."

    On September 22, Dulles was still in the United Nations slandering "international communism" for carrying out subversive activities. However, Anthony Leviero's report shows the world that it is not others who are actively carrying out subversive activities against other countries, but the United States, which is slandering China and the Soviet Union for so-called "subversive activities."

    美国的自供
    当苏联和爱好和平的国家正竭尽一切努力来加强国与国之间信任的时候，美国却正在大规模地训练特务，准备空投到这些国家去进行颠覆活动。美国“纽约时报”刊载的安东尼·勒维罗从美国北卡罗来纳州的布拉哥堡发出的通讯，就是美国训练空投特务的自供。
    从安东尼·勒维罗的报道中可以看出，这支特务部队是由一批叛徒、卖国贼和美国的特务分子们混合组成的。勒维罗说：在北卡罗来纳州的沼泽和深山中，他看到过这支“特种部队”。“第一个印象是：他们都是外国人”。勒维罗说，他们之中有许多是所谓“从共产党国家来的难民”，“军曹用波兰话、捷克斯洛伐克话、俄国话、德国话或其他语言大声喊口令”。除此之外，在这支“特种部队”里也有许多“正在准备大概要担负军事史上最艰巨的使命的美国人”。这是一批亡命之徒。他们有的是退伍军官，有的是所谓“冒险的青年”。
    根据勒维罗的报道，这批特务分子首先接受跳伞训练，随后就“在特种部队中服役”。这支“特种部队”的成员都“精通从手枪到一○五毫米口径的无后座力步枪的各种武器”，每一个人都是“专家”、“技师”，其中有“语言学家，爆破专家，无线电报务员和非常熟练的非职业医务人员”。他们都在受着“极端严格”的训练，并且要“训练成粗鲁、坚强和狡猾”的人。
    在训练完毕以后，这批凶恶的特务分子就将被空投到和平、民主国家中去从事破坏和颠覆活动。照勒维罗的报道，这些特务分子“将被用降落伞空投到敌人后方”，参加反革命分子在这些国家内所组织的所谓“游击队”，“帮助这些组织从内部”来进攻那里的民主政权。勒维罗特别提到，这种“空降特务部队的观念是从朝鲜战争的辛酸经验中得来的”。这是一个很有意思的供认。因为人都知道，在朝鲜战争期间，中国曾经逮捕了不少美国所派遣的中国籍和美国籍的间谍，而美国曾经企图矢口否认。
    勒维罗的报道使人了解特务分子的训练不仅在美国，而且在世界各地都在进行。勒维罗说，在布拉哥堡的是“第七十七特种兵团——空降部队”，“在德国的是第十兵团”。这支“部队”是非常庞大的。据勒维罗说，一支“特种部队”的分队通常约有二千人。勒维罗没有具体谈到美国在亚洲方面训练特务的情形。但是美国的所谓“西方企业公司”在台湾训练蒋介石特务分子，已经是谁都知道的事情。勒维罗也指出，就远东而论，美国的训练计划是为了实现“让亚洲人去打亚洲人”。
    九月二十二日，杜勒斯还在联合国诬蔑“国际共产主义”进行颠覆活动。但是，安东尼·勒维罗的报道使全世界看到，对他国积极进行着颠覆活动的不是别人，正是诬蔑中国、苏联进行所谓“颠覆活动”的美国。　（奇）
