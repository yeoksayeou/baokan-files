Welcome the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe
Chinese Musicians Association Standing Director An Bo

In the past few years, we have welcomed and received representatives of workers, youth, and women from Democratic Vietnam. Today, we have another opportunity to welcome and receive the song and dance troupe from this heroic neighbor. We are excited and delighted!

The Vietnamese people have a long tradition of revolutionary struggle, as well as a long-standing tradition of culture and art. Vietnam still preserves exquisite temple architecture and sculptural relics from the sixth and seventh centuries. By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, various Vietnamese arts had reached a high level. Vietnam's classical artistic heritage is very rich. For nearly a hundred years, although Vietnam has suffered from the invasion and devastation of imperialists, the Vietnamese people's artistic tradition has continued uninterrupted, constantly resisting colonial culture. The Vietnamese folk still possess a very rich collection of folk songs and folk music, its melodies being beautiful, gentle, and full of variation, fully demonstrating the creative talent of the Vietnamese people. Vietnam's folk dance heritage is also very rich. According to the investigations of Vietnamese artists, various forms have been discovered, including drum dances, fire dances, lantern dances, flag dances, bamboo pole dances, hat dances, fan dances, scarf dances, flower dances, umbrella dances, and other forms. From these folk dances, the mutual influence of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples in art can be seen more clearly. Now, we are very pleased that we can appreciate the excellent art of the Vietnamese people from this performance by the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe.

The art of the Vietnamese people is constantly developing and improving under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The artists of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have always been integrated with the people and have always served the people. No matter how difficult the environment, they have never stopped creating art. They have created various dramas, poems, and songs, expressing the Vietnamese people's love for their motherland and love for freedom, portraying countless heroic deeds worthy of praise, and praising President Ho Chi Minh, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people. They have traveled all over Vietnam, often staying with the soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army, and even fighting alongside the People's Army. Shortly after the liberation of Hanoi, the democratic government held a national performance, allowing the art of the Vietnamese people to be concentratedly expressed, giving the people great encouragement. The people said, "President Ho is not only victorious in leading the war of resistance, but also victorious in leading culture!"

Vietnam and China have been neighboring countries as closely related as lips and teeth since ancient times. As early as the second century BC, cultural exchanges between China and Vietnam began. In the past three or four decades, the mutual relationship between the revolutionary cultures of China and Vietnam has become even closer. For example, the artists of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have long studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and have attached great importance to the work experience we have accumulated in implementing this great literary and artistic guideline; similarly, we also cherish all the valuable achievements made by the Vietnamese artists under the call and leadership of President Ho. Enhancing cultural exchange between the two countries is the common desire of the two peoples. This visit and performance in our country by the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe, as well as our song and dance troupe's performance in Vietnam, marks the beginning of a larger-scale cultural exchange between China and Vietnam.

There is no doubt that the People's Song and Dance Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will be warmly welcomed by the broad masses of our audience and art workers! (Attached picture)

    欢迎越南人民歌舞团
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　安波
    在过去几年中，我们曾经欢迎、接待过来自民主越南的工人、青年和妇女的代表们，今天我们又有机会来欢迎、接待来自这个英雄邻邦的歌舞团。我们感到兴奋和喜悦！
    越南人民有长期的革命斗争的传统，也有悠久的文化艺术传统。越南至今还保存有六、七世纪的精美的寺院建筑和雕刻的遗物，而到了十三、四世纪，越南各种艺术已达到高度的水平。越南的古典艺术遗产是很丰富的。近百年来，越南虽遭帝国主义者的侵略和蹂躏，但越南人民的艺术传统仍然延绵不绝，始终同殖民文化相对抗。越南民间仍拥有十分丰富的民歌和民间音乐，它的曲调优美、委婉和富于变化，充分表现了越南人民的创作才能。越南的民间舞蹈遗产，也是很丰富的。据越南艺术家们的调查，现已发现的，有鼓舞、火舞、灯舞、旗舞、竹竿舞、帽舞、扇舞、巾舞、花舞、伞舞等各种形式，而从这些民间舞蹈中，更清楚地可以看出中越两国人民在艺术上的相互影响。现在，我们感到非常愉快，我们可以从这次越南人民歌舞团的演出中，欣赏到越南人民的优秀艺术了。
    越南人民的艺术在越南劳动党的领导下不断地发展着，提高着。越南民主共和国的艺术家们一直是同人民相结合的，一直是为人民服务的。不管环境多么艰苦，他们从未停止过艺术的创造。他们创作了各种戏剧、诗、歌曲，表现了越南人民热爱祖国、热爱自由的意志，表现了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹，歌颂了越南人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席。他们走遍了越南的国土，他们常常和越南人民军战士们在一起，甚至同人民军并肩战斗。河内解放后不久，民主政府即举办了一次全国性的会演，使越南人民的艺术得到了一次集中的表现，给予人民极大的鼓舞。人民说：“胡主席不但领导抗战是胜利的，领导文化也是胜利的！”
    越南和中国自古就是唇齿相依的邻邦。远在纪元前二世纪，中、越两国的文化即开始交流。在近三、四十年中，中、越两国革命文化的相互关系更加密切。譬如越南民主共和国的艺术家们很早就学习过毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，并十分重视我们在执行这一伟大文艺方针时所积累的工作经验；同样地，我们也十分珍视越南的艺术家们在胡主席的号召和领导下所获得的一切宝贵成果。增强两国的文化交流，这是两国人民的共同要求。这次越南人民歌舞团来我国访问演出以及我国歌舞团的赴越演出，标志着中、越两国文化更大规模地交流的开端。
    毫无疑问，越南民主共和国人民歌舞团将受到我国广大观众和艺术工作者们的热烈欢迎！（附图片）
