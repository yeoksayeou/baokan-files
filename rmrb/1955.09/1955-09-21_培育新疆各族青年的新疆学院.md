Xinjiang Institute Cultivates Youth of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang
Wang Bao

On the east side of the winding Urumqi River in Urumqi, amidst the dense and lush poplar trees, stand beautiful red and yellow buildings. This is the Xinjiang Institute, beloved by the youth of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

More than 1,200 male and female students from twelve ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Han, Mongolian, Manchu, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tatar, Tajik, Daur, and Xibe, study at the institute. Some come from the oases of the Tianshan Mountains, north and south; some come from the pastoral areas of Altay; some come from the grape-producing Turpan Basin; and some come from the rich and beautiful Ili River Valley. Although they come from different regions and have different ethnic compositions, they are as close as brothers and sisters under the common ideal of studying for the socialist construction of the motherland, and they study diligently in an atmosphere of mutual assistance and friendship. They study and live together today, in order to participate together in the construction of the motherland tomorrow.

The central task of the Xinjiang Institute is to train teachers for secondary schools and professional cadres urgently needed in Xinjiang for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and other fields. In the six years since liberation, more than 750 students have graduated. Some of these graduates are teaching in remote towns, villages, and pastoral areas, while others are participating in Xinjiang's production and construction endeavors. A portion, under the school's planned cultivation, have become teachers of lower-grade professional courses in the institute.

In order to further adapt to the ever-developing needs of economic and cultural construction in Xinjiang, the Xinjiang Institute is gradually moving towards standardization. The institute now has eight departments: mathematics and physics, biology and chemistry, Chinese language, history and geography, education, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, and arts. Through methods such as collective formulation of teaching plans and collective lesson preparation, the teaching quality of teachers is constantly improving.

The Party and the People's Government give the Xinjiang Institute cordial care in all aspects. In the past six years, the central government has successively transferred many cadres from higher education institutions in the interior to take on teaching and administrative work. The People's Liberation Army has built more than 24,000 square meters of new school buildings for the institute through voluntary labor. In the early days of liberation, books and teaching equipment were extremely scarce and rudimentary. The library had only over 10,000 books, most of which were in Chinese and foreign languages, with books in minority languages accounting for only 3% of the total. Now the library's collection has increased to more than 126,000 books, and books in various ethnic languages have also increased by nearly 30,000 volumes. In addition, more than 60,000 volumes of various professional books have been ordered from the Soviet Union and the interior and are being shipped in successively. The total value of teaching instruments added in the past six years has increased approximately eighty times compared to the early days of liberation. Taking microscopes as an example, 76 units have been added. The agriculture and forestry and animal husbandry departments are equipped with specialized practice farms and pastures. Here, students learn to drive tractors and experiment with improving livestock breeds, which makes them more passionate about their majors and consolidates the theoretical knowledge they have learned in books.

Xinjiang Institute will continue to progress with the development of Xinjiang's economic and cultural construction.

    培育新疆各族青年的新疆学院
    王堡
    在乌鲁木齐市曲折蜿蜒的乌鲁木齐河东侧，在那茂密青葱的白杨丛里，耸立着一栋栋美丽的红色和黄色的楼房。这就是新疆各族青年所热爱的新疆学院。
    在学院学习的，有维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉、蒙古、满、乌孜别克、柯尔克孜、塔塔尔、塔吉克、达呼尔、锡伯等十二个民族的男女学生一千二百多人。他们有的来自天山南北的绿洲；有的来自阿勒泰牧区；有的来自盛产葡萄的吐鲁番盆地；有的来自富饶秀丽的伊犁河谷。尽管地区不同，民族成份不同，但在为祖国社会主义建设而学习的共同理想下，他们都像兄弟姊妹般的亲近，在互助友爱的气氛中努力学习着各种知识。他们今天在一起学习，一起生活，为了明天一起参加祖国的建设。
    新疆学院的中心任务是培养中等学校的师资和新疆迫切需要的农林、畜牧、水利等专业干部。解放后六年来，毕业的同学已有七百五十多人。这些毕业生有的在辽远的城镇、农村和牧区担任教学工作，有的参加了新疆的生产建设事业。一部分在学校有计划的培养下，已成为本院低年级专业课程的教师。
    为了进一步适应全新疆经济、文化建设不断发展的需要，新疆学院正逐步走向正规化。学院现共设数理、生化、语文、史地、教育、农林、畜牧、艺术等八系。通过集体制定教学计划、集体备课等方法，教师们的教学质量正在不断提高。
    党和人民政府从各方面给予新疆学院以亲切的关怀。六年来，中央从内地各高等院校陆续抽调了许多干部来担任教学和行政工作。人民解放军曾以义务劳动给学院新建了两万四千多平方公尺的新校舍。解放初期，图书和教学仪器设备是极端缺乏和简陋的，图书馆仅有图书一万多册，其中绝大部分又是汉文和外文书籍，少数民族文字的书籍仅占总数的百分之三；现在图书馆的藏书量已增加到了十二万六千多册，各民族文字的书籍也增加了将近三万册左右。此外，还向苏联和内地订购了各类专业书六万多册，正在陆续运来。六年来增加的教学仪器总值比解放初期增加了约八十倍。仅以显微镜来说，就增添了七十六台。农林和畜牧系附设有专门的实习农场和牧场。同学们在这里学习驾驶拖拉机，在这里实验牲畜品种的改良，这就使同学们对自己所学的专业更加热爱，也巩固了书本上所学到的理论知识。
    新疆学院将随着新疆经济和文化建设的发展而不断进步。
