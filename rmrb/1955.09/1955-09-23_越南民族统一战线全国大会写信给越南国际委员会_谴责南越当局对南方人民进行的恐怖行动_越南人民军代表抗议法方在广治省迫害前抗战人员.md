The letter pointed out that these terrorist actions seriously violated Article 14, Clause C of the Geneva Accords.

The letter said: The French government is a signatory to the agreements concluded with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and it should fulfill its obligations under the Geneva Accords.

The letter also requested the International Commission on Vietnam to take all necessary measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected; and hoped that the International Commission will be able to successfully complete its task of ensuring that the Geneva Accords are respected and strictly implemented, thereby contributing to the defense of peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.

The letter said: The Vietnamese people are determined to defend their national rights, and they are resolutely fighting to shatter all conspiracies of the American imperialists to undermine the peace and unity of their motherland.

The letter said that the French side arrested fourteen former resistance personnel in An My, You Ling County on June 12th, 13th and 14th; these fourteen people are still being detained and subjected to inhumane torture. Prior to this, on April 23rd, the police agents and troops of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime conducted an armed search of An Huong in the same county, and arrested and took away five former resistance personnel, who were brutally beaten.
