Burhan Speaks on the Soviet Union's Disinterested Assistance to Xinjiang's Economic Construction

As the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is about to be established, Burhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, told Xinhua reporters that since liberation, all aspects of Xinjiang's construction have received sincere, disinterested, and comprehensive assistance from the Soviet government and the Soviet people.

Burhan said: The Soviet Union has provided great assistance to Xinjiang in establishing modern industry and developing transportation. In 1950, according to the agreement signed with the Chinese government to establish two joint-stock companies in Xinjiang for non-ferrous and rare metals and petroleum, the Soviet government sent a large number of industrial experts and transported complete sets of machinery and equipment to help China establish the Xinjiang Metal Company and the Xinjiang Petroleum Company, which today occupy a major position in Xinjiang's industry. During the period of Sino-Soviet joint operation, Soviet experts, in the absence of skilled workers, trained Chinese workers while building these two companies into large-scale metal mining enterprises and petroleum joint enterprises. After a large number of Chinese workers grew up and possessed the ability to independently manage these two enterprises, the Soviet government transferred its shares to China in January of this year.

Some modern factories that have been successively established in Xinjiang since liberation, such as the October Automobile Repair Factory and the Urumqi Automated Thermal Power Plant, were built using complete sets of the latest Soviet-made machinery and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts.

In recent years, a large number of Soviet geological experts, through arduous work in the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin, have trained exploration personnel of all ethnic groups sufficient to organize nearly a hundred exploration teams, and have found many rich metal deposits and promising petroleum structures, preparing for the large-scale development of industry in the Xinjiang region in the future.

With Soviet assistance, regular flights operated by Chinese drivers now fly weekly on three routes within Xinjiang, and thousands of trucks run on the long highways. Relying on these two modern transportation forces, industrial products worth about 236.6 million yuan and more than 200,000 dan of tea have been transported from the interior in recent years and delivered in a timely manner to the vast pastoral and rural areas, invigorating the economic life of all ethnic groups.

Burhan said: The Soviet Union is helping the people of Xinjiang change the backward state of agricultural and animal husbandry production. Now, the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, equipped with hundreds of tractors (calculated in standard units) and a large number of various agricultural machines, are establishing modern state-owned farms on the wastelands north and south of the Tianshan Mountains under the guidance of Soviet agricultural experts.

Soviet agricultural expert Titov, a professor at Xinjiang Bayi Agricultural College, used advanced Soviet cotton planting experience to guide the production corps in creating the highest national record for high yields on large areas of cotton fields in the Manas River basin at more than 40 degrees north latitude. This year, the average yield of cotton fields in this area will be more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. In 1954, Uyghur farmers in the famous Turpan County of the Fire Land, under the specific guidance of Titov, harvested a bumper cotton crop for the first time. This year, the average yield will be more than 340 jin of seed cotton per mu. Based on the experience of guiding production in the above two places, Titov also conducted inspections in the rural areas of southern Xinjiang, where more than three million Uyghur farmers live, and put forward suggestions for improving farming methods and developing cotton planting in southern Xinjiang.

For many years, locust plagues have occurred in the areas around Bosten Lake and parts of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang. From 1953, the Soviet government sent locust control experts for three consecutive years, bringing airplanes and medicines to Xinjiang to help control locusts. They carried out arduous work on more than 5.4 million mu of land, basically eliminating the gregarious migratory locusts in the Bosten Lake area, and severely injuring the Oedaleus asiaticus and Italian locusts in the main areas of the Junggar Basin, protecting farmland and pastures.

The Soviet Union has made good achievements in helping Xinjiang develop animal husbandry production. At present, more than 600 heads of fine breeds of livestock have been imported from the Soviet Union to Xinjiang. With the specific assistance of Soviet animal husbandry experts, more than 150,000 head of mixed-breed livestock have been successfully bred using these breeds. The Xinjiang sheep, which was successfully bred by the Gongnais Sheep Farm in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture using Soviet Rambouillet sheep and Xinjiang Kazakh sheep, has wool that is better than the world-famous Australian merino wool and is now being promoted nationwide as a fine breed.

The Soviet Union has provided tens of thousands of electric shearing machines, electric chaff cutters, artificial insemination equipment, and other animal husbandry machinery to help Xinjiang establish state-owned ranches and stud farms. In May of this year, a modern veterinary hospital appeared in the suburbs of Urumqi with the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, and has begun to diagnose and treat various sick animals.

Burhan said: Xinjiang's cultural, educational, health, and medical undertakings have also received strong assistance from the Soviet Union. Currently, the Xinjiang Medical College, with a construction area of more than 100,000 square meters, is being built under the guidance of Soviet experts at the foot of Liyu Mountain in the suburbs of Urumqi. After this modern medical college is completed in 1957, it will not only be a medical center in Xinjiang, but also a base for medical scientific research and medical work.

    鲍尔汉谈苏联对新疆经济建设的无私帮助
    新疆维吾尔自治区快成立了，新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉对新华社记者谈了解放以来新疆各项建设都得到苏联政府和苏联人民真诚无私的全面援助。
    鲍尔汉说：苏联对新疆建立近代工业和开展交通运输事业给了很大的帮助。一九五零年苏联政府根据和中国政府签订的在新疆创办有色及稀有金属和石油两个股份公司的协定，派出大批的工业专家，并运来全套机器设备，帮助中国建立了今天在新疆工业中占主要地位的新疆金属公司和新疆石油公司。在中苏两国合营期间，苏联专家在没有技术工人的条件下，一面培养中国职工，一面把这两个公司建设成为规模巨大的金属矿山企业和石油联合企业。当中国职工大批地成长起来，并具备了独立管理这两个企业的能力以后，苏联政府在今年一月就把他们的股份移交给中国。
    解放以后在新疆陆续建立的一些现代化工厂，如十月汽车修配厂和乌鲁木齐自动化火力发电站等，都是用苏联最新出品的全套机器设备，并在苏联专家具体帮助下建立起来的。
    几年来，大批的苏联地质专家，在准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地的艰苦工作中，已培养出足以组织近一百个探勘队的各族探勘人员，找到了很多丰富的金属矿床和有希望的石油构造，给新疆地区今后大规模发展工业作了准备。
    在苏联帮助下，目前每周都有由中国驾驶员驾驶的定期班机在新疆境内的三条航线上飞行，漫长的公路线上奔驰着几千辆载重汽车，依靠这两支现代的运输力量，几年来已从内地运进总值约两亿三千六百多万元的工业品，二十多万担茶叶，并及时地又把这些物资运送到辽阔的牧区和农村中去，活跃了各族人民的经济生活。
    鲍尔汉说：苏联正在帮助新疆人民改变落后的农、牧业生产状况。现在，用几百台（按标准台计算）拖拉机和大批各种农业机械装备起来的人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队，正在苏联农业专家指导下，在天山南北的荒野上，建立一座座的现代化国营农场。
    苏联农业专家、新疆八一农学院教授提托夫，运用苏联先进的植棉经验，指导生产部队在北纬四十多度的玛纳斯河流域，创造了大面积棉田丰产的全国最高纪录。今年这个地区的棉田，平均每亩可收籽花四百斤以上。一九五四年，著名火州吐鲁番县的维吾尔族农民，在提托夫具体指导下，第一次获得棉田大丰收。今年平均每亩将收籽花三百四十斤以上。提托夫根据在以上两地指导生产的经验，还在三百多万维吾尔族农民聚居的南疆农村进行了考察，提出了在南疆改进农作法和发展植棉事业的意见。
    新疆博斯腾湖滨和准噶尔盆地部分地区，许多年来一直有蝗虫灾害，从一九五三年起，苏联政府连续三年派遣治蝗专家并带着飞机和药品，到新疆帮助治蝗。他们在五百四十多万亩土地上进行了艰巨的工作，使博斯腾湖一带群集型的飞蝗基本消灭，准噶尔盆地主要地区的戟纹、意大利等蝗虫受到严重杀伤，保护了农田和草场。
    苏联帮助新疆发展畜牧业生产作出了很好的成绩。现在，从苏联输入新疆的优良种畜有六百多头。在苏联畜牧专家具体帮助下，用这些种畜交配成功的混血种牲畜有十五万多头。伊犁哈萨克族自治州巩乃斯种羊场，用苏联兰布里羊和新疆哈萨克羊杂交育种成功的新疆羊，它的羊毛比世界上著名的澳大利亚细羊毛还好，现在已作为优良品种在全国推广。
    苏联为帮助新疆建立国营牧场和种畜场，已供给了几万部电动剪毛机、电动铡草机、人工授精器材等各种畜牧业机械。今年五月，在苏联全面帮助下，乌鲁木齐市郊出现了一座近代化的兽医院，并已开始诊治各种病畜。
    鲍尔汉说：新疆文化教育和卫生医疗事业也得到苏联的大力援助。目前在乌鲁木齐市郊鲤鱼山下，正在苏联专家帮助下，修建一座拥有十多万平方公尺建筑面积的新疆医学院。这座近代化的医学院在一九五七年建成以后，不但是新疆的一个医学中心，而且是医学科学研究和医疗工作的基地。
