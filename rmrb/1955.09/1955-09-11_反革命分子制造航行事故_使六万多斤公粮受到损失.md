    Counter-Revolutionary Elements Create Navigation Accident, Causing Loss of Over 60,000 Jin of Public Grain
    Editor:
    At noon on June 21st of this year, a civilian boat loaded with public grain was sailing along the Zi River, and when it reached the Aotou shoal of Lianzi Township, District One, Xinshao County, Hunan, it suddenly left the main channel and plunged into the big waves, capsizing. More than 66,000 jin of public grain were lost in the water.
    It has now been verified that the capsizing of this civilian boat was intentionally caused by the counter-revolutionary element Wu Boheng. Wu Boheng is a helmsman with more than 30 years of experience in boat driving and is very familiar with the navigation conditions of the Zi River. That day, the boat was normally sailing in the main channel, but Wu Boheng suddenly pushed the rudder to the right, causing the boat to leave the main channel and plunge into the big waves. At that time, other boatmen tried to use oars to save the situation and turn the rudder to the right to straighten the boat and enter other channels, but these rescue actions were all stopped by Wu Boheng. As a result, the boat capsized in the big waves. Afterwards, Wu Boheng also attempted to use the change of the channel as an excuse to conceal his crime. After actual investigation and technical appraisal, it was proved that this was not the case at all, but completely his intentional act of sabotage.
    What kind of person is Wu Boheng? It turns out that he served as a battalion commander and executioner in the pseudo-warlord army; he was also the head of the reactionary secret society Tongshanshe. After liberation, he often spread rumors to confuse the public, saying things like "wolves and tigers will come out in that year and that month," "black winds will blow and black rain will fall in that year and that month," and so on. Since the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, Wu Boheng has tried every means to sabotage and provoke the relationship between workers and peasants. In 1949, Wu Boheng adopted an eleven-year-old girl in Yiyang as his goddaughter, but a few years later he inhumanly raped this young girl, while he himself is now over sixty years old.
    Although Wu Boheng has now been arrested and brought to justice, we should learn a lesson from this incident: we must ferret out the counter-revolutionary elements hidden in all corners! Jian Hang

### 反革命分子制造航行事故  使六万多斤公粮受到损失

    反革命分子制造航行事故  使六万多斤公粮受到损失编辑同志：
    今年六月二十一日中午，一艘载满公粮的民船沿资水行驶到湖南新邵县一区莲子乡坳头滩的时候，突然离开正泓道冲入大浪中覆没了。六万六千多斤公粮也全部落水。
    现已查明，这艘民船的覆没是反革命分子伍柏恒有意造成的。伍柏恒是一个有三十多年驾船经验的舵工，对资水的航道情况很熟悉。那一天这艘船本来正常地行驶在正泓道中，但是伍柏恒突然把舵往右边推动，使船离开正泓道而冲入大浪中。当时其他船工企图用橹急救和推转右舵使船身伸直并进入其它泓道；但是这些抢救行动都被伍柏恒制止了。结果，这艘船就横在大浪中沉没了。事后，伍柏恒还企图用泓道变更作借口来隐瞒自己的罪行。经过实际调查和技术鉴定，证明根本不是这末一回事，而完全是他有意的破坏行为。
    伍柏恒是怎样的一个人呢？原来他在伪军阀部队里当过营长和刽子手；还是反动会道门同善社的魁首。解放后他经常造谣惑众，说什么“那年那月出豺狼虎豹”，“那年那月要刮黑风，下黑雨”等。自从国家实行粮食统购统销以来，伍柏恒就千方百计的企图破坏，挑拨工人和农民的关系。一九四九年伍柏恒在益阳收了一个十一岁的女孩作义女，但是几年后他就绝灭人性地把这个幼女强奸了，而他自己现在已六十多岁了。
    伍柏恒现在虽然已经被逮捕法办，但我们应该从这件事情里得出教训：必须把暗藏在一切角落里的反革命分子清查出来！　建航
