Implement the "Three Fixes" Policy for Grain Down to the Household Level
    Do a Good Job of Grain Unified Purchase and Supply According to National Requirements
    Hui Yuyu, Governor of Jiangsu Province
      The promulgation and implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" and the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Supply of Grain in Towns and Cities" will further institutionalize our grain unified purchase and supply work and promote the victorious advance of socialist construction. In Jiangsu Province, the overall situation of grain unified purchase and supply in the past was good, but there were also some shortcomings. For example, in terms of unified purchase, the allocation of tasks was not entirely reasonable, resulting in the purchase of "excess grain" from a small number of farmers and insufficient unified purchase from another group of farmers. In terms of unified sales, some places were sloppy in their work, and the supply certificates were not fully discussed by the masses, resulting in supplies to those who should not have been supplied, too much supply to those who should have been supplied less, and early supply to those who should have been delayed, while a small number of grain-deficient farmers were not supplied in a timely manner. In cities, the grain supply was too generous, with many loopholes, and the phenomenon of wasting grain was serious. One of the main reasons for these shortcomings is the lack of a relatively complete system and method for grain unified purchase and supply. Now the State Council has issued the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" and the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Supply of Grain in Towns and Cities," implementing a system of combining purchase and sale in rural areas, dividing surpluses and deficits, unified arrangements, and management by certificate. This will effectively improve the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas. In cities, the implementation of a method of supplying grain according to per capita grading and quantity, and the implementation of a system of using supply certificates, grain coupons, and material coupons, can block loopholes in urban supply and ensure reasonable supply and conservation of grain.
    The implementation of these two measures will also greatly encourage farmers to increase agricultural production. Since Jiangsu Province implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, the enthusiasm of farmers for production and mutual cooperation has generally been greatly improved. However, a small number of farmers still have some concerns about the grain policy and the policy of mutual cooperation. This spring, Jiangsu Province, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, rectified the unified sales of grain, and carried out the work of fixing grain production, purchase, and sales from the province to the townships, eliminating some of the farmers' doubts and inspiring the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. They said: "The 'Three Fixes' settle our hearts, the country has a good foundation for construction, and the farmers have a good foundation for production." "The government has 'Three Fixes,' and the farmers have 'Three Mores' (more labor, more production, more grain retained)." Now the State Council has issued these two measures, clearly stipulating that the number of unified purchases will remain unchanged for three years from 1955, increasing production without increasing purchases, and not unifying the purchase of all surplus grain, which can be freely disposed of by farmers. This can further encourage farmers to actively increase production and eliminate the misconception among some farmers that "increased production leads to increased purchases" and "grain shortage is glorious."
    At present, Jiangsu Province is improving the work of grain unified purchase and supply in accordance with the two measures promulgated by the State Council. Throughout the province's rural areas, the work of "Three Fixes" for grain down to the household level is being carried out comprehensively on the basis of this spring's "Three Fixes" for grain down to the township level. The broad masses of farmers have expressed warm welcome to the "Three Fixes" down to the household level, saying: "The 'Three Fixes' down to the township, the heart is bright; the 'Three Fixes' down to the household, the heart is even clearer." In the cities, we are vigorously carrying out a grain conservation campaign, reducing unreasonable grain sales. The grain sales volume in Nanjing City in July decreased by 10.83 million jin compared with April; the grain sales volume in Nantong City in July decreased by 2.23 million jin compared with May; the grain sales volume in Changzhou City in May and June decreased by 2.53 million jin compared with March and April. From September 1st, cities such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, Changshu, and Xin Hai Lian implemented the method of supplying grain according to per capita rationing, and other towns and cities will continue to implement it. We should recognize that to do a good job in the unified purchase and sale of grain, we must conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological education for the broad masses of cadres and the masses, repeatedly explain the policies, and explain the methods. We must never relax our leadership and efforts in grain work just because we have a unified national law. At the same time, we must also be vigilant and smash all sabotage activities by illegal landlords, rich peasants, profiteers, and counter-revolutionaries.
    Jiangsu Province's grain unified purchase task this year has been reduced compared to last year and the year before. And this year, the province's autumn-ripening crops are generally growing well; as long as we do not become complacent and continue to work hard to overcome various natural disasters and strengthen field management, a bumper harvest can be expected. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, rely closely on the masses, and correctly implement the two measures promulgated by the State Council, the work of grain unified purchase and supply will certainly be done better than in the past.

    把粮食“三定”政策贯彻到户
    按照国家的要求，把粮食统购统销工作做好
    江苏省省长　惠浴宇
      “农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”的发布和实施，将使我们的粮食统购统销工作进一步制度化，并推动社会主义建设事业胜利前进。就江苏省来说，过去粮食统购统销工作总的情况是好的，但也有一些缺点，如在统购方面，任务的分配还不尽合理，以致向少数农民购了“过头粮”，向另一部分农民统购不足。在统销方面，有的地方工作潦草，发供应证时没有经过群众充分评议，以致对不该供应的也供应了，该少供应的多供应了，该推迟供应的提前供应了，而对少数该供应的缺粮农民又没有及时供应。在城市中粮食供应偏宽，漏洞很多，浪费粮食现象严重。造成这些缺点的主要原因之一，是粮食统购统销还缺乏一套比较完整的制度和办法。现在国务院发布了“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”，在农村实行购销结合，划分余缺，统一安排，凭证管理的制度，这就会使农村粮食统购统销得到切实的改善；在城市中实行粮食按人分等定量的供应办法，并实行使用供应证、粮票、料票的制度，这就可以堵塞城市供应中的漏洞，保证粮食的合理供应和节约。
    这两个办法的实行，也将大大鼓励农民增加农业生产。江苏省实行粮食统购统销以来，总的来说，农民的生产积极性和互助合作的积极性都有了很大的提高，但少数农民对粮食政策和互助合作的政策还有某些顾虑。今年春季江苏省遵照国务院和中共中央的指示，整顿了粮食统销工作，并进行了从省到乡的粮食定产、定购、定销工作，消除了农民的某些疑虑，鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性。他们说：“‘三定’定了心，国家有底好建设，农民有底好生产。”“政府有‘三定’，农民有‘三多’（劳动多，增产多，留粮多）”。现在国务院又发布了这两个办法，明确规定了统购的数字从一九五五年起三年不变，增产不增购，不统购全部余粮，余粮可以由农民自由处理。这就可以进一步鼓励农民积极增产，消除某些农民的“增产增购”“缺粮光荣”的错觉。
    目前江苏省正遵照国务院公布的这两个办法，改进粮食统购统销工作。全省农村中正在今春粮食“三定”到乡的基础上，全面地进行粮食“三定”到户的工作。广大农民对“三定”到户表示热烈欢迎，他们说：“‘三定’定到乡，心里亮堂堂；‘三定’定到户，心里更有数。”在城市中我们正在大力开展节约粮食运动，压缩不合理的粮食销量。南京市七月份的粮食销售量比四月份减少了一千零八十三万斤；南通市七月份的粮食销售量比五月份减少了二百二十三万斤；常州市五、六两个月的粮食销售量比三、四两个月减少了二百五十三万斤。从九月一日起，南京、无锡、常州、苏州、南通、徐州、镇江、常熟、新海连等城市实行粮食按人定量供应办法，其他各市镇，也将继续实行。我们应该认识到，要做好粮食统购统销工作，必须对广大干部和群众进行深入、细致的思想教育，反复讲清政策，交代作法，决不因有了全国统一的法令而放松了对粮食工作的领导和努力。同时还必须提高警惕，粉碎不法地主、富农、奸商和反革命分子的一切破坏活动。
    江苏省今年的粮食统购任务比起去年和前年，都有所减低。而今年全省秋熟作物一般生长良好；只要不麻痹大意，继续努力战胜各种自然灾害，加强田间管理，是可望丰收的。我们只要充分发动群众，紧紧依靠群众，把国务院发布的两个办法正确地贯彻下去，粮食统购统销工作一定可以比过去做得更好。
