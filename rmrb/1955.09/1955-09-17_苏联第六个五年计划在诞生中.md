    The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan is in the Making
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, a massive new plan guaranteeing unprecedented leaps in socialist production, is beginning to take shape. The formulation of this Five-Year Plan is a bottom-up process, starting from individual industrial enterprises. Currently, factory and mine workers across the Soviet Union are actively discussing and drafting their own enterprises' five-year plan proposals. These draft plans are then aggregated upwards, ultimately leading to the formulation of a national draft plan, which will be discussed at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February next year.
    The draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will contain many distinctive features. One of these is the organic integration of long-term plans with current plans. "Pravda," in its article on national planning published on September 8, stated: "The necessity has matured not only to formulate one-year and five-year economic plans but also to look ahead, formulate longer-term economic plans, and foresee how the various sectors of socialist production will develop in mutual relationship in the future." "Long-term planning is of great significance because the economic competition between the Soviet Union and the most developed capitalist countries is intensifying." "The significance of long-term planning also stems from the fact that the Soviet Union's economy is developing within the system of the socialist camp and is closely linked to the economies of the people's democracies."
    Another feature of the new draft plan is the extensive adoption of new scientific and technological achievements and advanced production experience. This is the case in several factories in Gorky City that I recently visited. They are not content with the excellent machines already produced and the existing technological processes but are absorbing advanced technologies and experiences, designing and producing new types of machines, and improving technological processes. The Gorky Milling Machine Factory is preparing, testing, and producing various large milling machines with complex structures. In the sixth workshop, the eighth hydraulic molding milling machine has been assembled; it is twenty-five meters long and requires only one worker to manage. Factory director Valentin Sukhov showed me drawings of many new universal milling machines and special-purpose milling machines that are about to be produced. He stated: What is new today will be old tomorrow if we stop moving forward, so we must constantly improve.
    The combination of long-term plans and current plans, the adoption of advanced technologies and experiences, and other features that make the draft plan as perfect as possible are all achieved through the mass line and by fully promoting the creativity of the masses.
    In the spring of this year, the Soviet Union, through the mass line and from the bottom up, formulated a five- to six-year plan for the development of agriculture. Relying on the creativity of the collective farm masses, the enormous task set by the January Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, to be accomplished in five to six years, will be realized in a shorter period. The bumper harvest in Ukraine, Kuban, and other regions this year, and the fact that Ukrainian collective farmers made good use of the land and planted twice as much corn, which can yield more than 30 million tons of feed, are all related to mobilizing the masses to formulate plans. Now, in the formulation of plans for industrial development, this method is also being adopted.
    The Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Factory in Moscow, which produces automatic continuous production lines, automatic machines, semi-automatic machines, and other modern machine tools, increased its total output by 58.7 percent during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Recently, its various workshops and departments convened meetings to discuss the development of production in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Workers and technicians put forward hundreds of suggestions for better utilizing the factory's potential. The factory leadership summarized the opinions of the masses at the workshop meetings, studied them, and derived a plan outline. Then, a conference of factory activists was held to discuss it. Factory director Kozhichikov reported on the factory's draft Sixth Five-Year Plan. The participants in the meeting enthusiastically put forward concrete and realistic suggestions. Engineer Volovik suggested: "The production plan should be organized in such a way that it helps to shorten the manufacturing process of machine tools. In recent years, the assembly process of automatic machine tools has been shortened by about half. However, the potential has not been fully exploited. The production process of machine tools can be subdivided to reduce the workload of the machining and assembly workshops. Improving the precision of parts processing can reduce the amount of manual labor currently used during assembly." The participants in the meeting pointed out that a new labor upsurge to greet the 20th Congress of the CPSU had emerged in the factory, and they demanded that the Party, trade union, and youth league organizations better lead the enthusiasm of the masses. They said that the development of production in this factory was closely related to the factories that supply it with cast steel, etc., and therefore called for strengthening cooperation between specialized enterprises. After mass discussion, the factory arrived at the following draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan: total output will increase by 50 percent in 1960 compared to 1955. The output of machine tools will increase by 54.7 percent, of which the output of special-purpose machine tools and linked machine tools will increase by 52 percent. Automatic continuous production lines should be complete sets. The factory will learn to produce new semi-automatic machines and many special-purpose machine tools. The draft also stipulates that labor productivity should be greatly increased, first by continuously reducing the amount of labor required to manufacture machine tools and machines. The draft also includes improvements in the living conditions of employees.
    When discussing the draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the workers and staff of the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow put forward more than 600 suggestions on tapping potential and widely adopting new technologies. The draft of the factory plan, based on the plans of various workshops, reflects the tasks put forward in the decision of the July Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. Due to the elimination of incidental production tasks and the fundamental reorganization of production, the output of the factory's basic products will double by 1960. In the new Five-Year Plan, the factory will produce new trucks and "ZIS-11" cars.
    The "Miner's Light" factory in Kharkov, which manufactures coal mining machinery and equipment, completed its Fifth Five-Year Plan in March of this year. This achievement was not easy to come by. When I visited this factory last year, I saw that all the workers and staff were constantly improving the technological process and production organization, striving for early completion of the plan. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, 350 workers in the factory completed more than ten years' worth of quotas, and the labor productivity of the entire factory increased by 87.5 percent. Every workshop and every production team in the factory put their minds to work during this discussion of the draft Sixth Five-Year Plan. They plan to increase output by 71 percent and labor productivity by 40 percent in the next five years.
    Every worker and staff member of every industrial enterprise in the Soviet Union is contributing their wisdom to the formulation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan and to the rapid advancement of a strong industry. The draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, conceived by the wisdom of the masses, will be a great blueprint in the construction of communism.

    苏联第六个五年计划在诞生中
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划，保证社会主义生产空前跃进的巨大新计划，正开始诞生。这次五年计划的制定，是从下而上，从各个工业企业开始。现在苏联全国厂矿职工积极地讨论和制定着自己企业的五年计划草案。然后这些计划草案向上汇集，最后将拟订出全国的计划草案，在明年二月举行的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上讨论。
    在制定中的第六个五年计划草案将包含许多特色。其中的一个特色是：远景计划和当前计划的有机结合。“真理报”在九月八日发表的关于国家计划的论文中说：“不仅制定一年和五年的经济计划，而且要向前看，制定较长期的经济计划，并预见到社会主义生产各个不同部门将来要在怎样的相互关系中发展，这样的必要性已经成熟了。”“由于苏联同最发达的资本主义国家的经济竞赛加强了，远景计划具有非常重大的意义。”“远景计划的意义，也因为苏联的经济是在社会主义阵营的体系中发展，并且是同各人民民主国家的经济密切相连的。”
    新计划草案的另一个特色是：广泛地采纳科学技术的新成就和先进的生产经验。我最近参观的高尔基城的几个工厂就是如此。它们都不满足于已生产的很好的机器和原有的工艺过程，而吸取先进的技术和经验，设计和生产新式的机器和改进工艺过程。高尔基铣床制造厂正在准备、试验和出产各式结构复杂的大铣床。在第六车间已装配好第八台水力模制铣床，它长二十五公尺，只要一个工人管理。厂长瓦连庭·苏贺夫给我看了将要生产的许多新式万能铣床和专用铣床的图样。他表示：今天是新式的机器，如果止步不前，明天会是不新式的，所以必须不断地改进。
    远景计划和当前计划的结合，先进技术和经验的采纳，以及其他使计划草案达到尽善尽美的境地的特色，都是经过群众路线，经过最充分地发扬群众的创造性的道路的。
    苏联在今年春季经过群众路线，从下而上地制定了发展农业的五、六年计划。依靠集体农庄群众的创造性，将在更短期间实现苏共中央一月全会所提的在五、六年内解决的巨大任务。今年乌克兰、库班等地丰收，乌克兰集体农民很好地利用了地面，多种了一倍玉蜀黍，可得到三千多万吨饲料，——这些都和发动群众制定计划有关。现在在制定发展工业计划方面，也采取了这个方法。
    莫斯科奥尔忠尼启则车床制造厂，出产着自动连续生产装置、自动机、半自动机和其他现代化车床。这个工厂在第五个五年计划中总产量增长了百分之五十八点七。最近它的各车间、各科都召集了会议，讨论了在第六个五年计划中发展生产问题。工人和技术人员们提出了几百个更好地利用工厂的潜在能力的意见。工厂领导方面把车间会议上群众的意见归纳起来，加以研究，得出了计划轮廓。然后举行了全厂积极分子大会来讨论它。厂长科芝契夫报告了工厂的第六个五年计划草案。会议参加者踊跃地提出了具体的实事求是的建议。工程师沃洛维克建议说：“应当这样组织生产计划：使它会帮助缩短车床的制造过程。最近几年来自动化车床的装配过程约缩短了一半。可是可能性还没有用尽。可以细分出产车床的程序，从而减轻机械加工车间和装配车间的工作。对零件加工的精确程度的提高，可以减少现在装配时用的手工。”会议参加者们指出现在工厂涌起了迎接苏共第二十次代表大会的劳动新高潮，要求党、工会和青年团组织更好地领导群众的积极性。他们说到这个工厂生产的发展，与供给它以铸钢等的工厂息息相关，所以要求加强各专业化企业之间的协作。经过群众讨论之后，工厂得出了这样的第六个五年计划草案：总产量在一九六零年比一九五五年增加百分之五十。车床的产量增加百分之五十四点七，其中专用的车床和联动的车床增加百分之五十二。自动连续生产装置应当是全套的。将学会生产新式的半自动机器和许多专用车床。草案也规定了首先经过不断减低制造车床和机器时的劳动量来大大提高劳动生产率。草案还包括改进职工居住和生活条件等内容。
    莫斯科斯大林汽车制造厂各车间在讨论第六个五年计划草案时，职工们提出了六百多项关于发掘潜在能力和广泛采用新技术的意见。以各车间计划为基础制成的全厂计划草案，反映了苏共中央七月全会决定中所提的任务。由于解除附带的生产任务，由于根本改组生产，工厂到一九六○年基本产品的产量将提高一倍。在新的五年计划中工厂将出产新式的卡车和“齐斯——一一”牌轿车。
    哈尔科夫制造煤矿机器设备的“矿工之光”工厂，在今年三月完成了第五个五年计划。这个成就不是容易得来的。去年我访问这个工厂时，看到全厂职工在不断地改进工艺过程和生产组织，争取计划的提前完成。在第五个五年计划中，工厂有三百五十个工人完成了十年以上的定额，全厂的劳动生产率提高了百分之八十七点五。全厂每个车间、每个生产组在这次讨论第六个五年计划草案时都动了脑筋。他们计划在未来的五年中把产量提高百分之七十一，把劳动生产率提高百分之四十。
    苏联每个工业企业的每个工人职员，都为第六个五年计划的制定、为争取强大工业的突飞猛进发挥着自己的智慧。群众的智慧孕育的第六个五年计划草案，将是共产主义建设中的伟大蓝图。
