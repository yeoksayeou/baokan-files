Seize the Time and Strive for Increased Production of Flue-Cured Tobacco
    Ge Fuyuan
    This year, most tobacco-producing areas have had poor results in completing their planned tobacco planting areas. Major producing areas have also suffered from varying degrees of drought and pests during the flue-cured tobacco growing season, resulting in low survival rates of seedlings after transplanting and serious missing seedlings in the fields. At the same time, the transplanting period for late-season tobacco in various places has also been delayed by more than half a month compared to last year due to drought. Currently, some late-season tobacco in Henan Province is less than a foot tall; black shank disease in flue-cured tobacco in Shandong, Henan and other places is also more serious than in previous years. Due to poor tobacco plant growth, the yield and quality of tobacco leaves have been adversely affected. Therefore, seizing the opportunity and taking effective measures to strive for increased production of flue-cured tobacco leaves to meet the needs of industry, civilian use, and export is the main task in the current flue-cured tobacco production work.
    Although early-season tobacco has already begun to be harvested and cured, there is still more than a month before all harvesting and curing are completed. Experience has shown that during this period, it is still possible to increase flue-cured tobacco production as long as field management is strengthened according to local conditions. Shandong tobacco farmers have a saying: "Three tobacco suckers, one tobacco leaf." This means that the nutrients consumed by three tobacco suckers can provide for the growth of one tobacco leaf. Therefore, first of all, it is necessary to explain the rationale to tobacco farmers and actively promote the technology of topping and sucker removal. In areas where topping is already customary, it is necessary to remove suckers every time a kiln of tobacco is cured; in provinces such as Guizhou, Yunnan, Liaoning, and Jilin, where there is no topping custom, tobacco farmers should be guided to top in order to reduce nutrient consumption, promote the development of top leaves, and increase yield. Secondly, in areas where black shank disease is serious, tobacco farmers should be guided to drain water from tobacco fields in a timely manner and clean the fields; if necessary, late-planted tobacco should continue to be earthed up to avoid autumn floods and prevent the spread of disease. This year, tobacco fields in Henan, Anhui and other provinces have insufficient fertilizer. Under natural conditions of uneven drought and flood, it is necessary to fully estimate the possibility of baking leaf loss occurring in the later stages of tobacco plant growth. Therefore, special attention should be paid to publicizing the state's price policy for purchasing low-grade tobacco this year, and guiding tobacco farmers to rush to harvest, cure, or sun-cure once baking leaves occur, in order to reduce product waste. For late-planted tobacco fields that have not been top-dressed, some quick-acting fertilizers (chemical fertilizers and well-rotted cake fertilizers, etc.) should be applied to promote the growth of tobacco plants and avoid baking leaf loss. In 1954, Henan and Anhui provinces achieved significant results in cultivating regenerated tobacco on a large area of nearly 200,000 mu, with an increase in tobacco leaf yield of 30 to 50 jin per mu; individual tobacco farmers in other tobacco areas also have experience in cultivating regenerated tobacco. It is estimated that there are about one million mu of early-season tobacco fields suitable for cultivating regenerated tobacco nationwide. If this cultivation work is done well, tobacco leaf production can be increased by 40 to 50 million jin. Therefore, in Anhui, Henan and other places where there is a cultivation habit, the sucker-retention technology of tobacco farmers should be further improved on the basis of last year to increase the yield and quality of regenerated tobacco. In areas where there is no regenerated tobacco cultivation habit, tobacco farmers should be guided to cultivate regenerated tobacco with a focus, and at the same time, dispel tobacco farmers' concerns about not being purchased, not being valuable, affecting next season's production, and unsuitable natural conditions, in order to lay the foundation for expanding the cultivation area in the future.
    Paying attention to educating tobacco farmers to harvest, cure or sun-cure top leaves and bottom leaves, so that no tobacco leaf is wasted and every tobacco leaf returns home, is also an effective way to increase production. This year, the Yixin Agricultural Production Cooperative and other four cooperatives in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, harvested and cured the bottom leaves that were discarded in the past, and increased their tobacco leaf income by more than 880 jin, and more than 90% of them were in-grade tobacco that met the local grading standards. However, the phenomenon of not harvesting and curing bottom leaves and top leaves is still very common in various places. Therefore, at present, it is necessary to actively mobilize agricultural production cooperatives to lead all tobacco farmers to pay attention to harvesting, curing, and sun-curing top leaves, diseased leaves, and baked leaves. This will not only increase the income of tobacco farmers, but also increase a lot of industrial raw materials for the country. At the same time, tobacco stalks are also a valuable raw material, and various places should also mobilize women and children to actively peel them in technical promotion.
  This year, tobacco fields in various places have increased compared with last year, but the increase in the construction of curing barns is very small. In addition, some curing barns in the water disaster areas last autumn have not been repaired to this day, so the contradiction between the area of curing barns and tobacco fields is very serious. According to a survey of six agricultural production cooperatives, including Xinhua in Lugou Township, Huaiyuan County, Anhui, the total area planted with tobacco this year is 583 mu, and the existing and planned curing barns total 23, which can only be used for curing 380 mu of tobacco fields (i.e., two-thirds of the tobacco fields). Therefore, at present, in addition to calling on the masses to repair and utilize old curing barns as much as possible, tobacco farmers should also be organized to rationally utilize curing barns and harvest and cure leaves in a timely manner. At the same time, some agricultural production cooperatives have not reasonably resolved the issues of depreciated prices of curing barns entering the cooperative and depreciation fees for using curing barns, which has affected the enthusiasm of some tobacco farmers for repairing and protecting private curing barns. Attention should be paid to solving this problem.
    Curing technology is an important link in determining the quality of tobacco leaves, but it has not yet been mastered by the majority of tobacco farmers. Therefore, first of all, it is necessary to train curing experts and conduct technical training in areas with poor curing technology and new tobacco areas; secondly, attention must also be paid to organizing individual tobacco farmers to carry out collective curing in order to improve the quality of tobacco leaves.

    抓紧时间争取烤烟增产
    戈福元
    今年大部产烟区完成植烟面积计划的情况较差。各主要产区在烤烟生长季节中又先后遭受了不同程度的干旱和病虫害，以致移栽后烟苗的成活率低，大田缺苗严重。同时各地晚烟的移栽期也由于干旱都比去年推迟了半个多月。目前河南省的部分晚烟尚不满一尺高；山东、河南等地烤烟的黑胫病，又较往年严重。由于烟株生长不良，烟叶的产量和品质都蒙受了不利的影响。因此，抓紧时机，采取有效措施，力争烤烟叶的增产，以适应工业、民用和外销的需要，是当前烤烟生产工作中的主要任务。
    目前早烟虽已开始采收烘烤，但到全部收烤完毕，还有一个多月的时间。经验证明，在这一段时间内，只要因地制宜地加强烟田管理，争取烤烟的增产还是可能的。山东烟农有“三个烟杈子，一个烟叶子”的谚语。就是说，三个烟杈子消耗的养分，就可供一片烟叶子生长的需要。因此首先应向烟农说清道理，积极地推广打顶抹杈的技术。在已有打顶习惯的地区，要做到烤一炉烟，抹一次杈；在没有打顶习惯的贵州、云南、辽宁、吉林等省，应指导烟农进行打顶，以减少养分消耗，促使顶叶开展，提高产量。其次，在黑胫病严重的地区，要指导烟农及时排除烟田积水，清洁烟田；必要时对晚栽的烟还须继续培土，以避免秋涝，防止病害的蔓延。河南、安徽等省今年烟田肥料不足，在旱涝不均的自然条件下，要充分估计到烟株生长后期发生烘叶损失的可能性。因此要特别注意宣传今年国家收购低次烟的价格政策，指导烟农在一旦发生烘叶时即抢收烘烤或晒制，以减少产品的废弃。对晚栽而又没有施用追肥的烟田，要施入一部分速效性的肥料（化学肥料和腐熟的饼肥等），以促进烟株的生长，避免发生烘叶的损失。一九五四年河南、安徽二省在近二十万亩的大面积上培育的再生烟，获得了每亩增产烟叶三、五十斤的显著效果；其他烟区的个别烟农，也有培育再生烟的经验。估计全国适宜培育再生烟的早烟田约在一百万亩左右，如作好这项培育工作，就可增产烟叶四千万斤至五千万斤。因此在有培育习惯的安徽、河南等地，应在去年基础上，进一步提高烟农的留杈技术，提高再生烟的产量和品质。在没有培育再生烟习惯的地区，要有重点地指导烟农进行再生烟的培育，同时解除烟农的怕不收购，怕不值钱，怕影响下季生产和怕自然条件不适宜等顾虑，为今后扩大培育面积打下基础。
    注意教育烟农收烤或晒制顶叶、脚叶，作到不浪费一片烟叶，争取烟叶片片还家，也是增产的有效办法。贵州省遵义县的一心农业生产合作社等四个社，今年将过去废弃不收的脚叶加以收烤，就增收了八百八十多斤烟叶，且百分之九十以上是合乎当地分级标准的等内烟。但各地不收烤脚叶、顶叶的现象仍很普遍，因此目前要积极地发动农业生产合作社，带动全体烟民，注意收烤和晒制顶叶、病叶、烘叶等。这样不但烟农可增加收入，国家也可增加不少工业原料。同时烟秸皮也是一种有价值的原料，各地在技术推广中也要发动妇女和儿童积极剥制。
  今年各地烟田较去年都有增加，而烤房的增建很少，加上有些去秋水灾区被冲塌的烤房至今还没有修复，因而烤房和烟田面积不相适应的矛盾很严重。据在安徽怀远县芦沟乡新华等六个农业生产合作社的调查，今年植烟总面积五百八十三亩，而现有的和计划兴建的烤房共为二十三座，只能供三百八十亩烟田（即三分之二的烟田）烘烤之用。因此在目前除要号召群众尽可能把旧烤房加以修理利用外，并应组织烟农合理利用烤房，适时采叶烘烤。同时由于有部分农业生产合作社对烤房的折价入社和使用烤房的折旧费等问题，还没有合理解决，已影响了部分烟农对培修和保护私有烤房的积极性。这一问题要注意解决。
    烘烤技术是决定烟叶品质高低的重要环节，但它目前还没有为广大烟农所掌握。因此首先要培养烘烤能手，在烘烤技术较差地区和新烟区进行技术传授工作；其次还须注意组织单干烟农进行集体烘烤，争取提高烟叶品质。
