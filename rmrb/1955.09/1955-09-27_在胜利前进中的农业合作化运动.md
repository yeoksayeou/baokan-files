The agricultural cooperative movement is now widely underway in rural areas across the country. People are concerned about this movement and worried whether it is developing too fast? Are agricultural cooperatives increasing production? Is the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit being implemented? Are farmers benefiting? To understand these issues more specifically, in May and June of this year, Representatives Zhang Zhizhong, Zhu Yunshan, and I went to Anhui to see the actual situation. We visited more than a dozen counties and cities in the four districts of Lu'an, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huizhou in Anhui Province; talked with many district and township workers, agricultural cooperative directors, production committee members, and cooperative members; and collected some specific materials. After this visit, we are convinced that the development of the agricultural cooperative movement is healthy, the agricultural cooperatives are being run successfully, and they are receiving enthusiastic support from millions of farmers in rural areas.

Anhui Province suffered an unprecedented flood last year, followed by drought and snowstorms. The affected area and population reached half of the province. However, even under very severe natural disasters, the cooperative movement still moved forward at a tremendous speed. According to statistics from Anhui Province in mid-July, there were a total of 38,504 agricultural cooperatives in the province, with 826,087 farm households joining, accounting for 12.42 percent of the total number of farm households. The total number of agricultural cooperatives increased by 7.19 times compared to 1954, and the number of participating farm households increased by 9.4 times. This is a tremendous development. Taking Shucheng County as an example, the county only had six agricultural cooperatives with 94 participating farm households when it started running cooperatives in 1953. In 1954, it developed to 41 cooperatives with 989 participating farm households. By 1955, it had developed to 485 cooperatives with 12,507 participating farm households. In Anhui, in addition to formal cooperatives, there are more than 11,000 spontaneous cooperatives, with approximately 168,000 participating households. These cooperatives are mostly spontaneously established by farmers according to the methods of nearby agricultural cooperatives. In Shucheng County, we visited such a spontaneous cooperative; we saw that their systems and methods were all learned from nearby cooperatives. Their crops were growing well, and they were working very actively. They said, "Agricultural cooperatives are fast and timely in everything, every piece of land is fertilized, production increases a lot, and they also engage in sideline production. Life is good, who wouldn't want to run a cooperative? We are all working together enthusiastically in production, hoping to be approved to formally run a cooperative soon."

Indeed, in the rural areas of Anhui, the cooperative movement has become a new driving force for life because farmers have received profound education. Farmers are looking forward to embarking on the socialist road to common prosperity through agricultural cooperatives with great enthusiasm.

According to our understanding, the reason why farmers have such great enthusiasm for the cooperative movement is first and foremost because the publicity and education of the General Line has raised their political awareness. In studying the General Line, they recognized the source of poverty and backwardness in the small-peasant economy through recollection and comparison, and they hated the exploitation of urban and rural capitalism in the past. Farmers in Changying Township, Taoxi District, Shucheng County, said: Before the publicity of the General Line, eight middle-peasant households in our township wanted to buy land. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, some people would have returned to the capitalist dead end of "thousands of families suffering to enrich one household." Secondly, they personally witnessed the superiority of agricultural cooperatives and recognized the policies and specific methods of taking the new socialist road. They realized that these policies and methods not only conformed to the interests of poor peasants but also to the interests of middle peasants.

What are the advantages of agricultural production cooperatives?

First, increased production. According to our understanding, in Anhui, except for cooperatives that suffered severe disasters, most cooperatives generally increased production. Among the 329 old cooperatives in Lu'an District, 221 increased production by 10 to 50 percent, 20 maintained last year's output, and 88 had varying degrees of production reduction. Reasons for the reduction: 78 cooperatives suffered from irresistible flood disasters, and 10 cooperatives were due to poor management. Taking the several cooperatives we visited as examples, the production increase was as follows: Huoqiao Cooperative, Gucheng Township, Shucheng County, produced an average of 403 jin of grain per mu in 1953, 539 jin in 1954, an increase of 136 jin per mu. The entire cooperative increased grain production by 192 dan, an increase of 33 percent compared to 1953. This year, it is expected to produce 665 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 30 percent compared to 1954. The agricultural cooperative led by Fan Jiadeng in Tangyan Township, Shucheng County, produced an average of 418 jin per mu in 1953, 541 jin in 1954, an increase of about 30 percent compared to 1953, 116 jin more per mu than mutual aid teams, and 133 jin more per mu than individual farmers. The increased production of agricultural cooperatives drove the entire township to increase production. Guantianfan Township, Lu'an County, is a cooperative township. 502 households participated in the cooperative, accounting for 88 percent of the total number of households. In 1952, the entire township produced 2,714,000 jin of grain, in 1953 it produced 2,951,000 jin, and in 1954, despite the disaster, it still produced 3,073,000 jin, an increase of 13.2 percent compared to 1952. These figures fully demonstrate that agricultural cooperatives play a huge role in increasing production, and it is indeed a method of increasing production with less investment, greater results, and faster results.

The main reasons for the increased production of agricultural cooperatives are the implementation of unified management, the rational allocation and use of land and labor, and the improvement of production technology. Members of the Minzhu Cooperative in Lu'an County said: Before the establishment of the cooperative, there was not enough labor, and fertilization and weeding could not be taken care of. Now that the agricultural cooperative is organized, the efficiency has been greatly improved. Although there were mutual aid teams last year, it still took 15 days of busy work to plant seedlings. This year, the cooperative only needed 7 days to complete it. In addition, half-laborers are used for cutting wheat and applying fertilizer, and the elderly and children are also assigned light work. The work is completed smoothly, and everyone feels relaxed and happy. Because work efficiency has been improved, not only is farm work done quickly and in a timely manner, but many cooperatives can also save a lot of labor to cultivate ponds, carry pond mud, raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer, build houses, and engage in other sideline production. One cooperative in Weigang Township near Hefei that we visited can save 2,000 labor days (equivalent to one-sixth of the total labor days of the cooperative) each year, in addition to the members' rest days, for growing vegetables, repairing ponds, raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, building houses, and other work, so that production and life are improved. In terms of technological improvement, agricultural cooperatives have played a leading role. In Anhui, most cooperatives have adopted advanced science and technology and implemented intensive cultivation. During the visit, we saw that the summer harvest area of ​​many cooperatives has been growing year by year, and high-yield crops such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, and double-cropping rice have increased; excellent varieties have been used for general crops; in rice cultivation, technical measures such as suitable seedling fields, small-plant close planting, rational irrigation, increased fertilization, and strengthening disease and pest control have been adopted. Many cooperatives have established technical teams to conduct research on various farming techniques to improve production. This has also driven the general improvement of production technology in the entire township. For example, in Guantianfan Township, Lu'an County, mentioned above, the land using small-plant close planting accounted for only 0.7 percent in 1953, 16.5 percent in 1954, and 72 percent in 1955. In terms of fertilization, 70 percent of the land in this township was not fertilized before liberation. By 1953, only 17 percent of the land was unfertilized. After 1954, every piece of land was fertilized, and the amount of fertilizer applied also increased year by year. Due to the improvement of production technology, the output of the entire township has been increasing year by year.

Second, agricultural cooperatives have the strength to overcome natural disasters. In last year's flood disaster, most cooperatives in the disaster areas reduced the damage due to the superiority of the cooperative economy, and some cooperatives even achieved increased production. According to statistics from Shucheng County, the disaster situation was very serious last year, and farmers' production was greatly reduced, but among the 41 cooperatives in the county, 20 increased production, 5 maintained production, and only 16 reduced production. Last year, in the struggle against the floods, farmers personally saw many vivid facts about agricultural cooperatives. For example, Yu Daojian, the director of the Yujia Xiaowei Cooperative in Wuli Township, Hangbu District, did not sleep for seven days and seven nights while leading the members of the cooperative in the fight against the floods. This deeply moved the farmers, so everyone also took action to save the production of many fields. The Xinzhuang Cooperative immediately planted 18 mu of seedlings after the water receded and obtained a season of late autumn, which also promoted the production and disaster relief work in the township. Many cooperatives allocated manpower to engage in production and sideline occupations after the disaster, and quickly restored their homes. Therefore, the farmers said: "Floods dispersed individual households, but cannot disperse agricultural cooperatives."

Due to the superiority of agricultural cooperatives in increasing production and resisting disasters, the lives of cooperative members have generally been improved. We visited a middle-peasant household in the Weigang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Hefei. He only received 28 dan of rice in the mutual aid team in 1953. After joining the cooperative in 1954, he received 34 dan of rice. In 1955, in addition to the 140 jin of wheat already harvested, he can also harvest 45 dan of rice. The income increase of the cooperative director, who is a middle peasant, is about the same as that of this middle-peasant household. Labor model Zhang Huiting said that their cooperative has more than three mu of land per person. When they were not organized in 1951, each mu only yielded more than 100 jin of grain, and each person averaged only more than 300 jin. But after being organized, each person averaged more than 500 jin in 1952 and more than 900 jin in 1953. Last year, with such a big flood, each person still received more than 700 jin. It is expected to receive more than 1,200 jin this year, which is three times more than when working individually. What an amazing rate of production increase! After the establishment of the cooperative, the livelihood problems of many households in difficulty have also been solved. Before the establishment of the Minzhu Cooperative in Lu'an County, four out of 57 households had to eat relief grain every year to survive. After the establishment of the cooperative, these four households' children grazed cattle, and the elderly did some light work. Their income was not only enough to eat but also had a surplus. In agricultural cooperatives, the lives of middle peasants have generally been greatly improved; poor peasants used to have poorer lives, but they have more labor and their lives will improve faster. In addition, due to the improvement of labor organization and the improvement of production efficiency, farmers can not only get adequate rest but also engage in cultural and recreational activities such as reading newspapers, learning culture, and watching operas. Farmers said: We are determined to follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The land reform turned us over, and agricultural cooperation makes us happier!

In the past two years, the cooperative movement in Anhui Province has made great progress. In order to consolidate the agricultural cooperatives, from February to July of this year, a lot of work was done to rectify the cooperatives. As a result of the rectification, only 1.28 percent of the approved cooperatives needed to be reorganized. Only 3 percent of the total number of participating households withdrew from the province. It can be seen that more than 98 percent of the approved agricultural cooperatives are consolidated, and 97 percent, that is, the absolute majority of farm households, fully support agricultural cooperatives. Some people are worried that the development of the cooperative movement is too fast, which is unfounded.

Through the rectification work, agricultural cooperatives have become more consolidated and improved. The first is the establishment of a production order. According to statistics, 85 to 90 percent of the cooperatives in Anhui Province have formulated production plans. Most cooperatives have promoted advanced production technology and improved labor organization and work evaluation methods. Among the 329 old cooperatives in Lu'an District, the number of cooperatives using "fixed points and flexible evaluation" decreased from 266 to 91, the number of cooperatives using "piecework recording" and "standard work points" increased from 13 to 162, the number of cooperatives using "seasonal contracting" increased from 49 to 66, and the number of cooperatives using "annual contracting for work and production" increased from 1 to 10. This has avoided the phenomenon of arguing over points and mixing points in the past and improved the production enthusiasm of the members. Secondly, the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit was further implemented in the rectification of the cooperatives. For example, some deviations in the valuation of farm implements and draught animals and the evaluation of land production were corrected, and the principle of distribution based on labor was adhered to. The reasonable solution of these problems not only improved the production enthusiasm of the members but also educated the mutual aid teams and individual farmers and dispelled their concerns about "returning to the big pile." After the rectification of the cooperatives, they said: The Communist Party's policies are reasonable, and we will run cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

Developing agricultural cooperatives and carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture is the most arduous historical task. We have seen that the cooperative movement is developing vigorously. Naturally, there are shortcomings on the road to victory. In individual areas, there are still mistakes of coercion and commandism and violation of the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. In some cooperatives, there are also phenomena of poor management, poor production organization, and weak leadership. In some areas, not enough attention is paid to the work of rectifying the cooperatives, the rectification is extremely crude, the problems left over have not been resolved, and the farmers still have some dissatisfaction. But we must recognize that these are local shortcomings and errors in the movement's advance. Of course, these shortcomings and errors must also be criticized and corrected. On the one hand, we must oppose the erroneous thinking of those who arbitrarily believe that the development of agricultural cooperatives is too fast and the cooperatives are not run well without conducting investigation and research, and we must prevent these erroneous thinking from hindering the development of the cooperative movement; at the same time, we must also oppose the erroneous thinking of attaching importance to development while neglecting consolidation and attaching importance to quantity while neglecting quality.

In order to welcome the greater development of the cooperative movement and to further improve the quality of agricultural cooperatives, we should do the following: First, on the basis of rectifying the cooperatives, continue to conduct inspections. We must understand the actual situation of the cooperatives that have been established, and further rectify the cooperatives with more problems. We must earnestly implement the policies and do a good job in production and economic work. As long as we run the existing cooperatives well and educate the farmers with practical examples, more farmers can be involved in the upsurge of cooperation. Second, strengthen the policy learning and business learning of grassroots workers and improve their leadership level. At the same time, we must cultivate a large number of leading backbones among the farmers. Mobilizing a large number of middle and primary school graduates and demobilized soldiers to participate in the cooperative movement is also very beneficial to the cooperative movement. In addition, we must strengthen the work of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives to provide economic assistance to agricultural cooperatives. Third, strengthen production technology guidance. A shortcoming in the current agricultural cooperative movement is that production technology is far from meeting the needs. We must strengthen the work of technical guidance stations and special district farms and county farms, and systematically summarize and promote advanced production technologies such as improved varieties, cultivation, planting, and disease and pest control. Fourth, in order to adapt to the great development of the cooperative movement in the coming winter and spring, the leading organs must make an overall plan for the development of agricultural cooperation on the basis of understanding the existing situation. With a comprehensive long-term plan, we can promote the cooperative movement forward in a more planned and effective manner.

    在胜利前进中的农业合作化运动
    全国人民代表大会代表　沈其益
    目前，农业合作化运动已在全国农村中普遍开展。人们关心这个运动，担心这个运动是否发展太快了？农业合作社是否增产？是否贯彻了自愿互利政策？农民是否得到了利益？为了比较具体地了解这些问题，今年五、六月间，我和张治中、朱蕴山两位代表到安徽去看看实际情况。我们曾经到过安徽省的六安、芜湖、安庆、徽州四个专区的十几个县市进行访问；和很多区乡工作人员、农业合作社主任、生产委员、社员谈过话；搜集了一些具体材料。经过这次访问，使我们深信农业合作化运动的发展是健康的，农业合作社是办得成功的，受到了农村中千百万农民们的热烈拥护。
    安徽省去年遭受到百年来未有的特大洪水，接着又遭旱灾、雪灾。受灾面积和人口达到全省的一半。但是，就是在自然灾害十分严重的情况下，合作化运动还是以巨大的速度向前迈进。据安徽省七月中的统计，全省共有农业合作社三万八千五百零四个，有八十二万六千零八十七户农民入社，占总农户的百分之十二点四二。农业合作社的总数比一九五四年增加了七点一九倍，入社农户增加了九点四倍。这是一个巨大的发展。以舒城县为例，一九五三年开始办社，全县才有农业合作社六个，入社农户九十四户。一九五四年发展到四十一个社，入社农户九百八十九户。到一九五五年就发展到四百八十五个社，入社农户增加到一万二千五百零七户。在安徽，除了正规的社，还有一万一千多个自发的社，入社户数约十六万八千户。这些社大都是农民按照附近农业合作社的办法，自发地搞起来的。在舒城县，我们访问了这样的自发社；看到他们的一些制度和办法，都是从附近的社学习来的。他们种的庄稼生长良好，他们工作很积极。他们说：“农业合作社的活样样快，样样及时，块块地上了粪，增产很多，还搞副业生产，生活好，谁不愿办社。我们大家齐心积极搞生产，盼望早日批准正式办社。”
    的确，在安徽的农村中，由于农民受到了深刻的教育，合作化运动已经成为新的生活的动力。农民们都怀着极大的热忱，盼望通过农业合作社走上共同富裕的社会主义大道。
    据我们了解，农民们对合作化运动所以怀着极大的热忱，首先是由于总路线的宣传教育，使他们的政治觉悟提高了。在学习总路线中，他们通过回忆对比，认识到小农经济是贫穷落后的根源，痛恨以往城乡资本主义的剥削。舒城县桃溪区长郢乡的农民说：在宣传总路线以前，我们乡就有八户中农想要买田。如果不是共产党和毛主席领导，有些人又会回到“苦死千家，发财一户”的资本主义的绝路上去。其次，是他们亲眼看到了农业合作社的优越性，认识了走社会主义新路的政策和具体办法。他们体会到这些政策和办法不但符合贫农的利益也符合中农的利益。
    农业生产合作社有哪些优越性呢？
    首先是增产。据我们了解，在安徽，除遭受严重灾害的社以外，一般社都是增产的。六安专区三百二十九个老社，其中二百二十一个社增产一成至五成，二十个社保持去年产量，八十八个社有不同程度的减产。减产原因：七十八个社是遭受了不可抗拒的洪水灾害，十个社是由于经营管理不善。以我们访问的几个社为例，增产的情况如下：舒城县古城乡花桥社，一九五三年平均每亩产粮食四百零三斤，一九五四年产五百三十九斤，每亩增产一百三十六斤。全社增产粮食一百九十二石，较一九五三年增产百分之三十三。今年预计每亩可产粮食六百六十五斤，比一九五四年增产百分之三十。舒城县塘堰乡范家登领导的农业合作社，一九五三年每亩平均产四百一十八斤，一九五四年产五百四十一斤，比一九五三年约增百分之三十，比互助组每亩多收一百一十六斤，比单干农民多收一百三十三斤。农业合作社的增产，带动全乡提高了产量。六安县关田畈乡是个合作化乡，参加社的有五百零二户，占总户数的百分之八十八。一九五二年全乡生产二百七十一万四千斤粮食，一九五三年生产二百九十五万一千斤，一九五四年虽然受到灾害还生产了三百零七万三千斤，比一九五二年增产百分之十三点二。这些数字充分说明，农业合作社在增产上起着巨大的作用，的确是投资少，收效大，收效快的增产办法。
    农业合作社增产的主要原因是实行了统一经营，土地和劳力得到合理的调配使用和生产技术的改良。六安县民主社的社员说：建社以前劳力不够，施肥除草都顾不过来，现在组织了农业合作社，效力提高了很多。去年虽然有了互助组，种秧还要十五天忙工，今年社里只要七天就做完了。此外，割麦、上粪都使用上半劳力，老人、小孩也分配上轻活，工作顺利完成了，大家感到轻松愉快。因为工作效率提高，不但农活干得快，干得及时，许多社还能节约大量的劳力来培修池塘、挑塘泥、养猪积肥、盖房屋和兼营其他副业生产。我们访问的合肥附近魏岗乡的一个社，除去社员的休息日外，每年还能节约二千个劳动日（相当于全社劳动日的六分之一）用于种蔬菜、修塘、养猪积肥、盖房屋等工作，使生产和生活都得到改善。在技术改良方面，农业合作社都起了带头作用。在安徽，一般社都采用了先进的科学技术，实行精耕细作。在访问中，我们看到不少的社夏收面积逐年增长，高产作物如马铃薯、甘薯、双季稻都有增加；一般作物都采用了优良品种；在水稻栽培上，采用了合式秧田、小株密植、合理灌溉、增施肥料和加强对病虫防治等技术措施。许多社都成立了技术小组，进行各种提高生产的耕作技术的研究。这也带动了全乡生产技术的普遍提高。例如前述的六安县关田畈乡采用小株密植的田地，一九五三年只有百分之零点七，一九五四年达到百分之十六点五，到一九五五年就达到百分之七十二。在施肥方面，解放前这个乡有百分之七十的田地不上粪，到一九五三年，未施肥的地只有百分之十七。一九五四年以后，块块地都上了粪，而施肥量也是年年增加。由于生产技术的改良，全乡产量逐年都在提高。
    其次是农业合作社有力量战胜自然灾害。在去年的洪水灾害中，一般灾区的社由于具备了合作经济的优越性，都减轻了灾害，有部分社并达到了增产。据舒城县统计，去年灾情十分严重，农民减产很多，但全县四十一个社中，还有二十个增产，五个保产，只有十六个减产。去年在同洪水作斗争中，农民亲眼看到农业合作社的许多生动事实。如杭埠区五里乡俞家小圩社的社长俞道见，在领导社员同洪水作斗争时，七日七夜不睡觉。这使农民深受感动，因此大家也行动起来抢救了不少田亩的生产。新庄社在水退后立即种秧十八亩，得到了一季晚秋，也推动了本乡的生产救灾工作。许多社在受灾后分出人力搞生产、搞副业，很快就恢复了家园。因此农民们说：“洪水冲散单干户，冲不散农业合作社。”
    由于农业合作社具有增产和抗灾的优越性，社员的生活普遍得到改善。我们访问了合肥魏岗乡农业合作社的一户中农，他一九五三年在互助组时，只收到二十八石稻子，一九五四年入社以后，收到了三十四石稻子，一九五五年除已收小麦一百四十斤外，还可以收稻子四十五石。这个社社长是中农，增加收入的情况大约和这户中农相同。劳动模范张会亭说，他们的社里每人有三亩多地，在一九五一年还没有组织起来的时候，每亩只收百多斤粮食，每人平均只有三百多斤。可是组织起来以后，一九五二年每人平均收五百多斤，一九五三年每人收九百多斤。去年闹了那样大的水灾，每人还收了七百多斤。今年预计要收一千二百多斤，比单干时要增加三倍。这样的增产速度何等惊人！办社以后，许多困难户的生活问题也解决了。六安县民主社，办社前在五十七户中有四户年年要吃救济粮才能过活。办社后，这四户小孩放牛，老年人作些轻活，收入不但够吃而且有余了。在农业合作社中，中农生活一般都得到很大的改善；贫农过去生活较差，但劳动力多，生活会改善得更快一些。此外，由于劳动组织的改进，生产效率的提高，农民除了得到适当的休息，还能够进行读报、学文化、看戏等文化娱乐活动。农民说：我们决心跟共产党毛主席走，土地改革使我们翻了身，农业合作化使我们更幸福！
    两年来安徽省的合作化运动已有了很大的发展。为了使农业合作社更加巩固，今年二月到七月又大力进行了整社工作。整顿的结果，在批准办的社中只有百分之一点二八的社是需要改组的。全省退社的只占总入社户数的百分之三。由此可见，在批准办的农业合作社中百分之九十八以上是巩固的，百分之九十七即绝对多数的农户是完全拥护农业合作社的。有的人担心合作化运动发展是不是太快了，那是没有根据的。
    通过整社工作，农业合作社更巩固更提高了。首先是建立了生产秩序。据统计，安徽全省已有百分之八十五到百分之九十的社制定了生产计划。大多数社都推广了先进生产技术，改善了劳动组织和评工记分的方法。在六安专区的三百二十九个老社中，采用“死分活评”的社由二百六十六个减到九十一个，采用“按件记工”和“标准工分”的社由十三个增加到一百六十二个，采用“季节包工”的社由四十九个增加到六十六个，采用“全年包工包产”的由一个增到十个。这样就避免了过去争分、混分的现象，提高了社员们的生产积极性。其次，在整社中进一步贯彻了自愿互利政策。如纠正了一些农具耕畜折价、田地评产偏高偏低的偏差，坚持了以劳为主的分配原则等。这些问题得到合理的解决，不独使社员的生产积极性提高了，而且也教育了互助组和单干农民，解除了他们怕“归大堆”的顾虑。在整社后，他们说：共产党的政策合理，秋后要办社。
    发展农业合作社，对农业的实行社会主义改造，是一项最艰巨的历史任务。我们已经看到合作化运动正在蓬勃地向前发展。自然，在胜利前进的道路上不是没有缺点的。在个别的地区，还有强迫命令，违反自愿互利政策的错误。在一部分社中也还有经营管理不善，生产组织不好，领导人员不强的现象。还有些地区，对整社工作重视不够，整理极为粗糙，遗留问题还没有解决，农民还有一些不满情绪。但是我们必须认识这是运动前进中的局部缺点和错误，当然，这些缺点和错误也是要批判纠正的。我们一方面要反对那些不进行调查研究就武断地认为农业合作社发展太快，办的不好的错误思想，要防止这些错误思想阻碍合作化运动的发展；同时也要反对那种只重发展，轻视巩固；只重数量不顾质量的错误思想。
    为了迎接合作化运动的更大发展和使农业合作社质量更进一步的提高，我们应该做好以下几方面的工作：一，在整社的基础上，继续进行检查。必须摸清已办社的实际情况，对问题较多的社还要作进一步的整顿。切实贯彻政策，做好生产工作和经济工作。只要把已有的社办好，以实际的事例来教育农民，就能使更多的农民卷入到合作化的热潮中来。二，加强基层工作人员的政策学习和业务学习，提高他们的领导水平。同时还要在农民群众中培养大量的领导骨干。动员大批中、小学毕业生和复员军人参加到合作化运动中来，对合作化运动也是十分有益的。此外，还要加强供销合作社和信用合作社的工作，在经济上予农业合作社以援助。三，加强生产技术指导。当前农业合作化运动中的一个缺点就是生产技术还远远地赶不上需要。我们必须加强技术指导站和专区农场、县农场的工作，有计划地把良种和耕作、栽培、病虫防治等先进生产技术加以总结推广。四，为了适应今冬明春的合作化运动的大发展，领导机关必须在摸清现有情况的基础上作出发展农业合作化的全面规划。有了全面的长远计划，就能更有计划地、更有效地推动合作化运动向前发展。
