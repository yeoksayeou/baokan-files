The fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales system is of great political and economic significance. Doing this work well will lay the foundation for grain work in the next few years, make future rural work more proactive, facilitate the completion of agricultural production increase plans, promote the agricultural collectivization movement, and benefit the smooth progress of the entire socialist construction cause.

The work of allocating grain production quotas to households in Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan, and other provinces has either concluded or is underway in most areas; other provinces have also conducted pilot projects and are in the process of, or about to, universally implement it. The development of this work in these provinces is generally normal. The peasant masses are jubilant, and their enthusiasm for production and cooperation has greatly increased. Many individual farmers and mutual aid teams, seeing the increased production of agricultural cooperatives and the state's policy of "increased production without increased purchase," have requested to join or establish agricultural cooperatives. This is a very good phenomenon.

However, on the other hand, some problems have emerged relatively commonly in the "three fixed" work in these provinces, which must be resolved promptly. Judging from the situation in various places, the main problems in the current grain "three fixed" work are that some staff members have blindly optimistic, impetuous, and quick-result-oriented sentiments. Their working methods are too simple, and the work is done hastily and crudely. In a few areas where the "three fixed" work has basically ended, there are still some outstanding issues, such as inaccurate production quotas, unfair purchase and sales quotas, and unclear demarcation of surplus and deficit grain, which has led to public dissatisfaction. In some places, purchase and sales have not been closely integrated. Some simply stipulated the figures for tax collection and unified purchase without seriously conducting fixed production and fixed sales. Some conducted fixed production and fixed purchase without simultaneously conducting fixed sales. According to an inspection by the Yuebei District Party Committee of Guangdong Province, in counties where the "three fixed" work was done relatively well, the number of townships where the work was truly well done and 90 percent of the masses were satisfied accounted for only a quarter of the total number of townships. Townships where 20 to 30 percent of the masses had opinions accounted for half, and townships with many outstanding issues accounted for a quarter. In Shangling Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong, staff members, fearing trouble, did not mobilize the masses and calculated figures behind closed doors, mechanically using the original grading from the 1952 land survey and fixed production as the basis, plus an average increase rate, without making any adjustments, and then issued notices to each household. Later, an inspection team sent by the higher authorities selected a village in this township for inspection and found that among the 44 households in the village, only 10 were basically reasonable. The purchase tasks were too light and should be increased for 19 households (should be increased by more than 11,600 catties), and the tasks were too heavy and should be reduced for 15 households (should be reduced by 12,000 catties). The fixed sales also did not take into account the specific situation of each household, so it was not entirely reasonable. If purchases were made according to the figures determined in this way, the task for the entire village would be 44,000 catties, of which 12,000 catties (27 percent) would be false, and supplementary sales would inevitably be required in the future. The fixed sales are not enough for the actual needs of some households, and sales will inevitably increase in the future. It is not difficult to imagine what the consequences of doing this would be.

Of course, these problems are just some "tendencies." However, if we do not pay attention to preventing them early and allow them to develop, they will have an extremely adverse impact on the overall work and will lead to serious consequences. We know that the state has announced that fixed production and fixed purchase will remain unchanged for three years; if the production and purchase figures are now determined to be unreasonable, it will directly affect the next three years; its indirect impact will be even longer than three years. If the production quota is not realistic, the purchase and sale are not well integrated or not integrated at all, the unified sales are not effectively arranged, and the fixed sales figures break through the national plan or cannot actually meet the normal needs of truly grain-deficient households, the situation of this spring may reappear next spring, causing artificial tension; and because the unified purchase figures have been reduced and the state has less grain in its hands, it may make the work of rectifying unified sales more difficult than this spring. If fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales are unreasonable, their consequences will inevitably affect the development of the agricultural collectivization movement and the completion of agricultural production increase plans, hinder the entire rural work, affect the relationship between the Party and the peasants, and be detrimental to the consolidation and strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance.

Why do blindly optimistic, impetuous, and hasty phenomena occur in the grain "three fixed" work? The main reason is that some staff members believe that the methods are clear, the tasks are easy, and a bumper harvest is expected, so the tasks can be completed without hard work. Some leading organs also hope to end the grain work sooner so that they can concentrate all their efforts on leading the agricultural collectivization movement; in addition, there are other important tasks, so they have not paid enough attention to adhering to and implementing the grain "three fixed" work. Both of these ideas are one-sided and should be overcome immediately.

The method of allocating grain production quotas to households is new. Not only are the vast majority of peasants unfamiliar with it, but many staff members also lack experience. This requires a series of full and detailed publicity and explanation work. No matter how good the method is, if it cannot be accepted by the vast majority of cadres and the masses, problems will still arise. Heavy tasks may cause problems; lighter tasks may also cause problems if the work is not done well. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that China is still dominated by small-scale peasant economy. The strength of the labor force, the amount of means of production, the quality of the land, the level of technology, and the amount of consumption of each household of farmers are all unbalanced. The specific situation of production and life is extremely complex. Not only are they different within a province, county, or district, but they are often very different within a township or village. If the numbers of grain production, purchase and sales are determined by egalitarian methods, it will definitely not be in line with reality and will definitely make the work bad. If you are afraid of "trouble" in these works, and simply engage in it, you will inevitably leave more and bigger troubles. If you are afraid of prolonging the time, do not rely on the masses, do not go deep into the masses, and subjectively calculate behind closed doors before distributing the numbers, then deviations will inevitably occur.

It is necessary to strive to complete the grain "three fixed" work as soon as possible. However, it is wrong to think that the grain "three fixed" work does not need to be carried out practically and meticulously because of this. On the contrary, in order to truly complete the task as soon as possible, the work must be carried out in a down-to-earth, in-depth, and meticulous manner. Some townships that have already "completed" the "three fixed" work have been forced to start from scratch because the work was done crudely; if the work is not done well and the mistakes are not corrected, then not only will the grain work not be done well, but agricultural collectivization and other work will also be more passive. If the "three fixed" work is done meticulously and correctly, and the masses are mobilized and the masses' socialist awareness is raised in the process of work, the future grain work will take less time, and the collectivization movement can be carried out more smoothly.

In order to thoroughly do the "three fixed" work well, to implement the policy 100%, and to lay a solid foundation for future work, it is necessary to correct and prevent the tendency of impatience and haste in a timely manner, and resolutely not allow the grain "three fixed" work to slip by lightly. Leading organs at all levels should make unified arrangements for all major tasks and arrange them appropriately. It is necessary to be good at grasping the main links of the "three fixed" work and effectively solving the key problems in the "three fixed" work. That is to say, in addition to setting the output actually and reasonably implementing the purchase, we should firmly grasp the link of fixed sales. This is the key to improving grain work. Therefore, we must not only know how many grain-deficient households there are in the entire rural area, but also know exactly how many grain-deficient households there are in each township and village, how much grain is lacking, and when the grain is lacking. In specific work, meetings of grain-deficient households should be held to formally determine the supply figures for each household, obtain their consent, compile a list of grain-deficient households, and, after approval by the higher authorities, hand it over to a certain grain supply point to be responsible for controlling the supply. Only by doing this step effectively can the work be transferred to the collectivization movement. This is what the Party committees at all levels must resolutely do well. It should be pointed out that many comrades attempt to solve all the big and small problems related to grain work through this "three fixed" work to households. This is impossible. In fact, only a few major aspects can be truly solved this time. Some minor problems can only be gradually solved in the next few years; otherwise, the delay will affect the development of the collectivization movement. The Central Committee stipulates that after the work reaches the township, the work in each township must strive to end within fifteen days, and at the latest, it must not exceed twenty days. By adopting this method of proceeding in batches, the grain "three fixed" work to households and purchase and storage work in a province can be completed within three months. During this period, all localities must strengthen the centralized and unified leadership, concentrate the necessary forces, and do a good job of grain "three fixed" work and storage work with all their strength.

In the grain "three fixed" work, it is necessary to earnestly remember the two basic experiences summed up from the grain unified purchase and sales work in the past two years: closely integrate political mobilization work with specific business work; closely integrate purchase work with sales work. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, rely on grassroots organizations, rely on agricultural production cooperatives, rely on poor peasants, unite with middle peasants, and do a good job of investigation, research, registration, and calculation work on the basis of universally improving the masses' awareness. It is necessary to oppose the tendency of calculating behind closed doors, and also oppose the tendency of neglecting specific business work. The actual experience of many regions has proven that only by combining purchase and sales can it be easy to distinguish the boundaries between surplus and deficit grain, to accurately determine production, and to mobilize the masses. The "three fixed" work must be carried out strictly in accordance with the interim measures for unified purchase and sales of rural grain issued by the State Council, and everything that violates these measures must be changed immediately. Party committees at all levels should pay close attention to the progress of the grain "three fixed" work, inspect the work in a timely manner, exchange experiences, promote achievements, correct mistakes, and thoroughly do this work well.

### 粮食“三定”到户的工作必须彻底做好

    粮食“三定”到户的工作必须彻底做好
    粮食定产定购定销是具有重大政治和经济意义的。做好了这个工作，就可以为今后几年的粮食工作打好基础，可以使今后的农村工作更加主动，有利于完成农业增产计划，有利于开展农业合作化运动，有利于整个社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
    广东、广西、浙江、江苏、河南等省的粮食“三定”到户的工作，有的已经结束，有的正在大部分地区进行；其他省份也都做了典型试验，正在或即将普遍展开。这些省份的工作的发展基本上都是正常的，农民群众欢欣鼓舞，生产积极性和合作积极性大为提高。许多单干农民和互助组，看到农业合作社产量提高，而国家又实行“增产不增购”的政策，因此，纷纷要求参加或举办农业合作社。这是很好的现象。
    但是，另一方面，在这些省份的“三定”工作中，也比较普遍地出现了一些问题，必须及时加以解决。从各地的情况看来，当前粮食“三定”工作中的主要问题是一些工作人员有盲目乐观急躁图快的情绪，工作方式过于简单，工作做得草率粗糙。少数“三定”工作基本结束了的地区，仍有若干遗留问题，如产量定得不准，购销定得不公，余粮缺粮的界限没有划清，以致群众还有意见。有些地方购销还没有密切地结合进行，有的简单地规定了征收和统购的数字，没有认真进行定产、定销；有的进行了定产、定购，没有同时进行定销。据广东省粤北区党委检查，在“三定”工作做得比较好的县份，工作真正做得好、群众百分之九十满意的乡，不过占总乡数的四分之一，仍有百分之二、三十的群众有意见的乡占二分之一，遗留问题很多的乡占四分之一。广东新会县上凌乡，工作人员怕麻烦，不发动群众，关门计算数字，机械地以一九五二年查田定产时原定等级作根据，加上平均的增产率，不作任何调整，就向各户发出了通知书。后来，上级派出的检查组选择这个乡的一个村作了检查，发现在全村四十四户中，基本合理的只有十户，统购任务过轻应调高的十九户（应调高一万一千六百多斤），任务过重应调低的十五户（应调低一万二千斤）。定销也没有照顾到各户的具体情况，所以就不尽合理。如果按照这样定下来的数字统购，全村的任务是四万四千斤，其中就有一万二千斤（百分之二十七）是虚假的，将来势必补销；定销不够有些户的实际需要，将来也势必增加销量。这样做会招致什么结果是不难想像的。
    当然，这些问题还只是一些“苗头”。但是，如果不及早注意防止，任它发展下去，就会对全盘的工作发生极为不利的影响，并且会招致严重的后果。我们知道：国家已经宣布定产定购三年不变；如果现在把产购数字定得不合理，就要直接影响到今后三年；它的间接的影响，更不止三年。如果产量定得不实，购销结合不好或者没有结合，统销没有切实安排，定销数字突破国家计划或者不能确实满足真正缺粮户的正常需要，明年春天就可能重新出现今年春天的局面，引起人为的紧张；而且因为统购数字已经减少，国家掌握的粮食少了，就可能使整顿统销的工作比今年春天更为困难。定产、定购、定销如果不合理，它的后果都必然影响农业合作化运动的开展和农业增产计划的完成，妨害整个的农村工作，影响党同农民的关系，不利于工农联盟的巩固和加强。
    为什么在粮食“三定”工作中会出现盲目乐观、急躁草率的现象呢？主要原因是：有些工作人员认为办法明确了，任务轻松了，丰收有望，不必进行艰苦的工作就可以完成任务了。某些领导机关也希望快些结束粮食工作，以便集中全力领导农业合作化运动；加以还有其他重要工作，所以就没有足够地注意坚持和贯彻粮食“三定”的工作。这两种思想都是片面的，都应该立即克服。
    粮食“三定”到户的办法是新的，不但广大农民不熟悉，许多工作人员也还缺乏经验。这就需要进行一系列充分的细致的宣传解释工作。无论办法怎么好，如果不能为广大干部和群众所接受，也仍然会出乱子。任务重了当然可能出乱子；任务减轻了，如果工作做得不好，同样也会出乱子。而且粮食征购数量减少了，也还有分配合理不合理、公平不公平的问题。同时，也不可忘记，我国目前仍是小农经济占优势，各户农民劳动力的强弱，生产资料的多少，土地的好坏，技术的高低，消费的多少都是不平衡的，生产和生活的具体情况是极其复杂的，不但一省一县一区之内各不相同，一乡一村之内也往往大有差别。如果用平均主义的办法来确定粮食产购销的数字，是一定不能切合实际的，一定会把工作做坏的。如果在这些工作上怕“麻烦”，简单从事，势必遗留更多更大的麻烦。如果害怕拖长时间，不依靠群众，不深入群众，主观地关门计算之后就把数字分派下去，那就一定会发生偏差。
    努力争取提早完成粮食“三定”工作，这是必要的。但是，如果认为粮食“三定”工作因此可以不必切实地细致地进行，那就不对了。正相反，要想真正提早完成任务，就必须脚踏实地地深入细致地进行工作。有一些已经“完成”了“三定”工作的乡，因为工作做得粗糙，被迫不得不从头做起；如果做得不好而坚持不改正，那末，不但粮食工作做不好，农业合作化和其他工作也将更加陷于被动。如果“三定”工作做得细致、正确，并且在工作过程中发动了群众，提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，今后的粮食工作就会花费较少的时间，合作化运动也能比较顺利地开展。
    为了把“三定”工作彻底做好，把政策百分之百地贯彻下去，为今后的工作奠定坚实的基础，就必须及时纠正和防止急躁草率的倾向，坚决不让粮食“三定”工作轻轻地滑过去。各级领导机关应当把各项重大任务统一部署，适当安排。必须善于抓住“三定”工作的主要环节，切实解决“三定”工作中的关键问题。这就是说：除了要把产量定实，并且合理地实行定购以外，应该紧紧抓住定销这个环节。这是改进粮食工作的关键。因此，我们不但要知道全部农村有多少缺粮户，而且要把每乡每村究竟有多少缺粮户，缺多少粮，什么时候缺粮，都弄得清清楚楚。在具体工作中，要举行缺粮户会议，正式确定每户的供应数字，取得他们的同意后，编成缺粮户名册，经过上级批准，交由一定的粮食供应点负责掌握供应。只有切切实实做好这一步，才能把工作转到合作化运动。这是各级党委必须坚决把它做好的。应当指出，不少同志企图通过这次“三定”到户的工作，把有关粮食工作的一切大大小小的问题都加以解决。这是不可能的。事实上，这次只能真正解决几个主要方面的问题，有些次要的问题，只能留待以后几年逐步加以解决；否则就要拖延时日，影响合作化运动的开展。中央规定，工作到乡以后，每个乡的工作必须力争在十五天内结束，最迟也不得超过二十天。采用这种分批进行的办法，一个省的粮食“三定”到户和征购入库工作就可以在三个月内完成。各地在这个期间，必须加强集中统一的领导，集中必要的力量，全力做好粮食“三定”工作和入库工作。
    在粮食“三定”工作中，必须切实记取从过去两年粮食统购统销工作中总结出来的两条基本经验：把政治动员工作和具体业务工作密切结合起来；把征购工作和销售工作密切结合起来。应当充分地发动群众，依靠基层组织，依靠农业生产合作社，依靠贫农、团结中农，在普遍提高群众觉悟的基础上做好调查研究登记计算工作。既要反对关门计算的偏向，也要反对忽视具体业务工作的偏向。许多地区的实际经验已经证明，只有购销结合进行，才便于分清余粮缺粮界限，便于正确定产，便于发动群众。“三定”工作必须切实按照国务院发布的农村粮食统购统销暂行办法进行，一切违背这个办法的，都必须立即改变过来。各级党委应当密切注意粮食“三定”工作的进展情况，及时地检查工作，交流经验，发扬成绩，纠正错误，把这个工作彻底做好。
