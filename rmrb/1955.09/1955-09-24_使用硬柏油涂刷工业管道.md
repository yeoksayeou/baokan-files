    Applying Hard Asphalt to Industrial Pipelines
    Xu Zhongyang
    In January of this year, the Dongchuan Installation Team of the Southwest Nonferrous Metallurgical Electromechanical Installation Company successfully tested the use of hard asphalt for coating pipelines. The facts prove that using hard asphalt to coat pipelines can save funds and ensure project progress and quality.
    In industrial pipeline laying projects during capital construction, asphalt is often applied to the outside of the pipes to extend their service life and prevent rust. In the past, the method of coating pipes was to mix soft asphalt and gasoline in iron oil drums, then heat them to melt the asphalt and gasoline together, and then use a brush to apply the hot asphalt to the cold pipes. This method of coating pipelines has a major drawback: because hot asphalt and cold pipes do not easily bond, the asphalt easily falls off after cooling and solidifying, and the asphalt coating is not easily uniform, often resulting in the overuse of asphalt and labor.
    The method of using hard asphalt to coat pipes is: first use a wire brush to clean the rust, oil stains, and other debris from the pipes, then heat the pipes to forty to eighty degrees Celsius, and then apply hard asphalt at sixty degrees Celsius to the heated pipes.
    The benefits of using hard asphalt to coat pipes are: it can improve quality, because the applied asphalt easily bonds with the hot pipes, making it less likely to crust or fall off, and the applied asphalt is smooth and uniform; it can greatly save raw materials such as asphalt and gasoline, and reduce costs. According to statistics, after the team used hard asphalt to coat pipes, the cost was reduced by 79.5% compared to using soft asphalt, and it was more than 67% cheaper than the central government's stipulated quota; it improved production efficiency. For example, when using soft asphalt, sixteen people could only coat eighteen pipes per day, but after switching to hard asphalt, sixteen people could coat fifty pipes per day.
    With the development of national economic construction, the number of industrial pipelines being laid is increasing day by day. If the advanced method of coating with hard asphalt is fully promoted, it will save the country a significant amount of funds.

    使用硬柏油涂刷工业管道

    今年一月，西南有色冶金机电安装公司东川安装队试用硬柏油涂刷管道成功。事实证明使用硬柏油涂刷管道可以节约资金，保证工程进度和质量。
    在基本建设敷设工业管道工程中，为了延长管子使用寿命、防止管道生锈，需要在管子外边涂刷柏油。过去涂刷管道的方法都是用软柏油和汽油混合放入铁油桶内，再加热使柏油和汽油熔化在一起，然后用刷子将热柏油涂刷在冷管子上。用这种方法涂刷管道有个很大的缺点：因为热柏油和冷管子不易结合，柏油冷却凝固后很容易脱落，而且涂刷的柏油也不易均匀，往往因此多用柏油和人工。
    使用硬柏油涂刷管道的方法是：先用钢丝刷将管道上的铁锈和油污等刷干净，然后将管子加热到四十度至八十度，再将六十度的硬柏油往加热后的管子上涂刷。
    使用硬柏油涂刷管子的好处是：可以提高质量，因涂上去的柏油容易同热管子结合，也就不容易结壳或脱落，而且涂上的柏油光滑均匀；可大大节约柏油和汽油等原料，降低成本。据统计，该队使用硬柏油涂刷管子后，较使用软柏油降低了成本百分之七十九点五，较中央规定的定额还便宜百分之六十七以上；提高了生产效率。如涂用软柏油十六个人每天只能涂十八根管子，改用硬柏油后每天十六个人可涂五十根管子。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，工业管道的敷设数量日益增加，如果全面推广涂刷硬柏油的先进办法，将会给国家节约一笔很大的资金。
