Herdsmen in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are actively carrying out various preparations for overwintering and spring, preventing disasters and protecting livestock, and striving to ensure that all livestock safely pass through the winter and spring.

Currently, on the vast grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the broad masses of herdsmen are driving thousands upon thousands of livestock to "Aoter" (shifting grazing grounds) to fatten them up in autumn. The livestock of the four pastoral banners of Hulunbuir League comprehensively moved into grasslands with water sources on both sides of the river around the beginning of autumn, grazed by experienced herdsmen. The Xilin Gol League, with the most livestock, organized all barren livestock to go to "Aoter" during the summer fattening period, shifting grazing grounds every ten to fifteen days, improving grazing techniques, and therefore the livestock were in better condition than in previous years.

Hulunbuir, Xilin Gol, Jirem, Ju Ud, Yikezhao, Ulanqab, and other six leagues plan to cut more than 1.96 billion catties of grass. Hulunbuir League currently has 437 mowing and raking machines, and more than 1,200 herdsmen have invested in grass cutting production. Jirem League, which is mainly agricultural, plans to cut 1.1 billion catties of grass throughout the league, and requires each banner and county to trial produce 10 to 15 silage cellars; Kulun Banner has decided to prepare 1 million catties of silage in some agricultural production cooperatives.

With the development of settled nomadism, various places have also repaired and built some livestock sheds and corrals. According to incomplete statistics from the Chahar League, more than 2,000 original sheds have been repaired and more than 700 new sheds have been built. The Xilin Gol League requires the entire league to build 880 sheds before mid-October, and to build more livestock pens and wind and snow barriers. The leaders of Hulunbuir, Ulanqab, Yikezhao, and other leagues have also made corresponding decisions.

In addition, in order to ensure the health of livestock in winter and spring, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Department also held a symposium on the prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases in livestock; now, in addition to the Yikezhao League, which has already launched deworming work, other leagues are actively preparing, and deworming work will begin soon.

### 内蒙古各地牧民积极进行牲畜过冬准备

    内蒙古各地牧民积极进行牲畜过冬准备
    内蒙古自治区各地牧民，积极展开过冬过春、防灾保畜的各项准备工作，争取全部牲畜安全渡过冬春。
    目前，在内蒙古自治区辽阔的草原上，广大牧民正在赶着成千上万的牲畜走“敖特尔”（移场放牧）抓秋膘。呼伦贝尔盟牧业四旗的牲畜早在立秋前后，就全面移入河流两岸有水源的草场，由有经验的牧民跟群放牧。牲畜最多的锡林郭勒盟，在抓夏膘时就组织全盟空胎牲畜走“敖特尔”，每隔十天到十五天移场一次，改进放牧技术，因而畜膘比往年较好。
    呼伦贝尔、锡林郭勒、哲里木、昭乌达、伊克昭、乌兰察布等六个盟共计划打草十九亿六千多万斤。呼伦贝尔盟现有四百三十七台打、搂草机，一千二百多名牧民投入打草生产。以农业为主的哲里木盟，计划全盟打草十一亿斤，并要求每个旗、县试制青贮饲料十至十五窖；库伦旗已决定在部分农业生产合作社中调制青贮饲料一百万斤。
    随着定居游牧的发展，各地也整修和搭盖了一些牲畜棚圈。察哈尔盟据不完全统计，已修好原有棚圈二千多座，新搭棚圈七百多座。锡林郭勒盟要求全盟在十月中旬以前搭棚八百八十座，并要多盖畜圈和防风雪屏障。呼伦贝尔、乌兰察布、伊克昭等盟领导方面，也做出了相应的决定。
    此外，为保证冬春两季牲畜体质健康，内蒙古自治区农牧厅还举办了防治牲畜寄生虫病座谈会；现在除伊克昭盟已展开驱虫工作外，其他各盟正在积极准备，驱虫工作即将开始。
