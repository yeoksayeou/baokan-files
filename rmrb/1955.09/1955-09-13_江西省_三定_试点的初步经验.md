Implement the "Three Fixes" Grain Policy Down to the Household

    Preliminary Experiences of "Three Fixes" Pilot Program in Jiangxi Province
    Yin Zhijin, Chen Ying
    In Jiangxi, the pilot work of implementing the "Three Fixes" down to the household generally involves three steps, taking about half a month to twenty days.
    I. Enhance the Understanding of the "Three Fixes" Policy Among基层 Workers and the Masses
    1. Hold Two Meetings Well: Most townships emphasize holding two meetings well at the beginning of the "Three Fixes" implementation pilot work: one is a Party branch general meeting (or enlarged branch meeting), and the other is a township people's representative meeting. The broad masses of基层 workers generally actively support the "Three Fixes" policy, but they also have varying degrees of ideological concerns. They believe that publicizing the policy contradicts completing the task, fearing that they will not be able to complete the task; fearing that the figures will change after they are determined, and the masses will complain later; fearing that they will take the lead in suffering losses. The main reason for these ideas is that they do not have a good grasp of the production, purchase, and sales situation within the township and are not sure. Some workers have concerns because there were shortcomings in the unified purchase and sales work in the past, or they blindly took the lead in selling "excess grain" in their work. Therefore, the following issues are generally focused on at the meeting.
    (1) Repeatedly explain and discuss the "Three Fixes" policy so that every worker can have a more thorough understanding of the policy, recognizing that the "Three Fixes" is an important measure to do a good job in the unified purchase and sales of grain, eliminate the ideological concerns of farmers, further develop agricultural production, and ensure the smooth progress of national industrial construction.
    (2) Calculate the overall account of the whole township and the small accounts of a village and group, and even several typical households. There are two accounts: One is last year's grain purchase account. By calculating this account, the workers realize that this year's task is reasonable and will not be more than last year, in order to dispel the workers' psychology of fearing "more purchases every year"; the other is the increased production account for 1955. Through this account, the workers clearly recognize that as long as the increased production plan is completed, not only can the grain purchase task be completed, but farmers will also have more surplus grain to dispose of themselves. After calculating the accounts, initially analyzing and clarifying the situation, the workers generally have a clear understanding, have confidence in their work, and can happily accept the task.
    (3) Check and summarize the unified purchase and sales work to correct the workers' understanding of the unified purchase and sales policy. In the past, there was a tendency to simply emphasize the advantages of the "Three Fixes" in propaganda, deny the achievements of past unified purchase and sales, and oppose the "Three Fixes" to unified purchase and sales. Therefore, the great achievements of the past two years of unified purchase and sales must be affirmed, and some shortcomings and errors in the work must also be checked to help the workers distinguish the shortcomings in the work from the policy itself, so that they can correctly understand the unified purchase and sales policy.
    (4) Make the workers understand that after the "Three Fixes," the state will only purchase the established amount of grain from farmers within three years, with no increase in purchase for increased production, in order to increase farmers' enthusiasm for production and achieve the goal of developing production and ensuring supply. Therefore, in the "Three Fixes" work, the figures for fixed production and fixed purchase should first be determined to the household at one time and remain unchanged for three years. This point must be especially emphasized in order to eliminate the doubts of workers and the masses about the task being prone to change.
    (5) Educate the workers to carry out the "Three Fixes" work down to the household with a realistic attitude. Not only must they resolutely complete the task, but they must also resolutely implement the policy. Workers should take the lead, and how much grain they should keep and how much grain they should buy should also be handled in accordance with the policy. They should not use their powers for personal gain or engage in malpractice, nor should they sell "excess grain."
    After the ideological problems are largely resolved, further guide them to discuss some specific issues in the "Three Fixes" work, such as: how to determine production? How to determine consumption standards? How to divide the surplus and deficit lines? What kind of meetings should be held? How to combine with production, etc.
    II. Mobilize the Masses. The situation in various places proves that after the policy meets with the masses, most people are happy and support it, but there are also some concerns: fearing that the production will be set too high; fearing that too little consumption will be left; fearing that the policy will change; fearing that they will not be able to complete the task after a disaster; hidden production households fear that if the actual production is verified, old accounts will be settled. In order to dispel these concerns of farmers, various places focus on explaining some basic principles in the "Three Fixes" policy to the masses in propaganda, such as why implement the "Three Fixes"? How to carry out the "Three Fixes"? What are the benefits of the "Three Fixes" for the country and for farmers? What attitude should farmers take towards the "Three Fixes" work, etc., and repeatedly explain that only 80% to 90% of the surplus grain is purchased, dispelling farmers' concerns about "bottomless grain purchases and no guarantee of supply." Most areas also summarize some benefits of the "Three Fixes" from the actual experience of farmers to educate farmers.
    After the initial propaganda of the "Three Fixes" policy, the masses generally have the following ideological manifestations: farmers with better production, stronger labor, or greater potential for increased production (mostly middle peasants or new middle peasants) are very enthusiastic after hearing the "Three Fixes" policy, believing that they can keep more with more increased production; some poor peasants with weak labor, insufficient fertilizer, and relatively barren land find it more difficult to increase production and believe that the "Three Fixes" is only good for middle peasants; idlers have a resistant attitude towards the "Three Fixes" from the beginning. Therefore, in propaganda, it is necessary to carry out different education for the above different ideological types, and help them formulate production plans and overcome specific difficulties in production to encourage their enthusiasm for production and confidence in increasing production. II. Do a Good Job of "Three Fixes" Down to the Household, Implement the Combination of Purchase and Sales. The steps of "Three Fixes" down to the household are generally to first determine production, then determine consumption, and then determine purchase and sales figures.
    The following are several better ways to determine production in various places:
    1. Use the production assessed during the unified purchase in 1954 as a basis, make appropriate adjustments to determine the actual normal production. Generally, if the deviation in the核产 last year was small, adjust based on the total production of the household; if the deviation was large, adjust the level of the核产 last year, and then re-register each plot and grade household by household. 2. Agricultural cooperatives use the production at the time of joining the cooperative as a basis, make appropriate adjustments, and mutual aid teams and individual households find the same land as agricultural cooperatives for comparison to determine (applicable to areas with more agricultural cooperatives). 3. Use the actual production in 1953 as a basis to determine the actual normal production (applicable to areas affected by disasters last year).
    Determining production is an extremely meticulous and arduous task. Many farmers initially understood the "Three Fixes" policy, but it did not work when it came to specifically determining production. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize solving ideological problems at any time and emphasize that the approach is correct. According to a typical survey in Dengjia Township, Dongxiang County, a total of 69 households in the township concealed production, accounting for 13.2% of the total number of households. The most concealed production was by rich peasants and landlords, who wanted to evade the purchase task. Individual agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams also had collective concealment of production. Therefore, in the work of determining production, it is necessary to expose the facts of landlords and rich peasants deliberately concealing production and crack down on their destructive activities; on the other hand, it is necessary to further conduct in-depth ideological education for farmers to establish the idea of loving the country and supporting national industrialization; for agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the main focus is on clearing the thinking of the cooperative and team staff, and then mobilizing members to further clarify the actual production. When the work enters the stage of determining purchase and sales, the masses have two ideas: some farmers hope to increase the standard of consumption and get more sales in order to keep more and get more grain; some farmers have egalitarianism and always unreasonably compare with each other. Therefore, before the purchase and sales figures are specified to the household, it is necessary to repeatedly carry out the policy education of "what should be purchased must be purchased in full, and what should not be purchased must not be purchased resolutely; reduce unreasonable supply and ensure reasonable supply," and explain that it is glorious to work hard to increase production and sell more surplus grain. At the same time, the training of calculation and tabulation personnel should be done well, and the data on field conversion, population increase and decrease, etc. should be fully grasped to prepare for the work of purchase and sales to the household.
    To do a good job of determining purchase and sales, it is necessary to do a good job of evaluating and verifying the amount of grain used by each household in advance.
    Food Grain: There are five ways to retain food grain in various places: 1. Determine the necessary amount of food grain for each household based on the actual needs of each household. Generally, a unified standard of food grain is determined for the whole township, and then the necessary food grain for each household is determined according to the situation of households with roughly the same number of adults and children; households with more old, young, weak people; and households with more labor and more adults; 2. Self-report fixed sales; 3. Grade by age, first determine the amount of grain for each grade, and then calculate the amount of grain retained by each household according to the grade; 4. Determine according to the actual food grain consumption in the past two or three years; 5. Use the task to set the consumption amount, leave as much as you can, and complete the task first. Among the above five methods, the first one is more realistic and in line with the policy, and is welcomed by farmers; the second one can be tried under the leadership's knowledge; the third and fourth ones are not easy to achieve completely reasonable, and should not be adopted in general; the fifth one is a violation of the policy and should not be adopted. Generally, the grain retained by surplus grain households is slightly higher than that of deficit grain households. The increase in production this year should be added to the calculation of the food grain for deficit grain households. If there is very little deficit grain, mobilize savings and try not to supply or supply less as much as possible.
    Feed: Calculate on the spot according to the type, number of heads, and grain consumption habits of livestock.
    Seeds: Generally, they are retained according to actual needs. Some areas retain a little more to prevent rotten seedlings and take care of the need to reform cultivation techniques.
    After the consumption standard is determined, divide the surplus, deficit, and sufficient boundaries by household. Determine the figures for fixed purchase and fixed sales.
    There are two better ways to determine purchase: 1. In areas where last year's grain purchase was basically reasonable and the masses were satisfied, adjust according to the changes in fields and population this year based on last year's unified purchase task; 2. Use calculation as the main method, combined with摸底 to correct deviations, and self-report and mutual evaluation on the basis of串联.
    In most areas, the practice of determining sales is to realistically determine the supply amount according to the deficit part after deducting the public grain to be paid and the necessary consumption amount from this year's planned production (that is, including the reliable increase in production). However, when calculating sales, attention should be paid to appropriately relaxing the requirements for deficit grain households with a lack of labor, because it is indeed more difficult for these people to increase production. If the supply amount is determined according to the planned production, there will be a risk of failure, which will increase the difficulty of future supply work. This point must be fully estimated when determining sales.
    At the same time, it is necessary to repeatedly explain to farmers in the定销: from August to February of the following year, it is the grain harvest season. During this period, the state generally does not supply grain. Therefore, every deficit grain farmer must strictly arrange their own grain consumption plan, eating their own first and then the state's, and striving to save.
    III. Improve Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production by Summarizing the "Three Fixes" Work
    After the preliminary determination of the production, purchase, and sales tasks down to the household, the Party branch (in some areas, the branch is the core, and key members and honest, just, and trusted old farmers are absorbed to participate in organizing the evaluation team) conducts a preliminary review to compare the total figures of levy, purchase, and sales with the task figures of last year and this year, and conducts a check by household to see how many households are reasonable? How many households are still not reasonable enough? In particular, households with large deviations in last year's unified purchase should be carefully reviewed to ensure reasonableness. After preliminary adjustment, mobilize the masses to mutually evaluate by village or electoral district, and make adjustments after investigation and verification of individual unreasonable cases.
    After the masses' evaluation, the Party branch makes another review based on these materials, and then convenes a township people's representative meeting to finally核定, issue a list to settle the case, issue purchase and sales certificates, and compile a roster. Some areas also issue draft lists first, and then issue formal lists to settle the case after mass evaluation.
    After each household's case is settled, organize farmers to discuss and formulate pre-sale and pre-delivery plans according to each household's levy and purchase tasks, and mobilize farmers to deliver grain after the harvest.
    At the end of the work, further conduct education on the "Three Fixes" policy by summarizing the work, summarize the benefits of the "Three Fixes" to the country and farmers, and encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production.

专栏：把粮食“三定”政策贯彻到户

    江西省“三定”试点的初步经验
    尹志进　陈英
    江西各地“三定”到户的试点工作一般分为三个步骤进行，时间约在半月至二十天左右。
    一、提高基层工作人员和农民群众对“三定”政策的认识
    一、开好两个会：多数乡在“三定”到户试典工作的开始阶段都着重开好两个会，一是党支部大会（或支部扩大会），一是乡人民代表大会。广大基层工作人员对“三定”政策一般是积极拥护的，但也有程度不同的思想顾虑。他们认为宣传政策同完成任务有矛盾，怕完不成任务；怕数字确定后会变，以后群众要埋怨；怕带头吃亏。产生这些思想的主要原因是他们对乡内产、购、销情况掌握不够，心中无底。有的工作人员所以有顾虑，还因为过去统购统销工作中有缺点，或是在工作中盲目带头卖了“过头粮”。因此，在会上一般着重解决了下面几个问题。
    （一）反复交代和讨论“三定”政策，使每一工作人员对政策都能有较透彻的了解，认识到“三定”是做好粮食统购统销工作，消除农民思想顾虑，进一步发展农业生产和保证国家工业建设顺利进行的重要措施。
    （二）算好全乡的大账和一村一组以至若干典型户的小账。大账有两笔：一笔是去年的购粮账。通过算这笔账使工作人员认识到今年任务合理，不会多于去年，以解除工作人员怕“年年多购”的心理；一笔是一九五五年的增产账。通过这笔账使工作人员明确认识，只要完成了增产计划，就不仅可以完成购粮任务，农民还会有更多的余粮归自己处理。通过算账后，初步分析和查清了情况，工作人员一般都心中有底，工作有信心，能愉快地接受任务。
    （三）检查和总结好统购统销工作，端正工作人员对统购统销政策的认识。各地在宣传中曾出现单纯强调“三定”好，否定过去统购统销成绩，把“三定”和统购统销对立的偏向。因此，必须对两年来的统购统销伟大成绩加以肯定，对工作中的某些缺点和错误也要进行检查，帮助工作人员把工作中的缺点和政策本身区别开来，使其能正确地认识统购统销政策。
    （四）使工作人员懂得：经过“三定”以后，三年之内，国家向农民只购既定数字的粮食，增产不增购，以提高农民的生产积极性，达到发展生产、保证供应的目的。因此，“三定”工作中应首先把定产、定购的数字一次规定到户，三年不变，定销每年一定，这一条要特别强调，以消除工作人员和群众怕任务多变的疑虑。
    （五）教育工作人员本着实事求是的态度来进行“三定”到户的工作，不但要坚决完成任务，还要坚决贯彻政策。工作人员要起带头作用，自己应留多少粮食，应买多少粮食，同样要按政策办事，不要利用职权，徇私舞弊；也不需要卖“过头粮”。
    思想问题大体解决后，就进一步引导他们讨论“三定”工作中的一些具体问题，如：定产如何定？怎样确定消费标准？余、缺界限怎样划分？要召开一些什么样的会议？怎样同生产结合等等。
    二、把群众发动起来。各地情况证明，政策同群众见面后，绝大部分欢欣拥护，但也有一些疑虑：怕产量定高了；怕消费量留少了；怕政策会变；怕受灾后完不成任务；瞒产户怕查实了产量要算老账。为了打消农民这些疑虑，各地在对群众宣传中，着重向群众讲清“三定”政策中的一些基本道理，如为什么要实行“三定”？怎样进行“三定”？“三定”对国家、对农民有些什么好处？农民对“三定”工作应抱什么态度等，并反复说明只购余粮的百分之八十至九十，打消农民担心“购粮无底，供应无保证”的顾虑。多数地区还从农民实际体会中总结出“三定”的一些好处，用来教育农民。
    在初步宣传“三定”政策后，群众思想一般有以下几种表现：生产较好，劳力较强，或是增产潜力较大的农民（多系中农或新中农），听到“三定”政策后，认为多增产可以多留，劲头很高；有些劳力不强，肥料不足，土地较贫瘠的贫农，增产比较困难，认为“三定”只是对中农好；二流子一开始时便对“三定”有抵触情绪。因此，在宣传中就必须针对以上不同思想类型，进行不同的教育，并帮助他们制定生产计划和克服生产上的具体困难，以鼓舞他们的生产积极性和增产信心。二、做好“三定”到户，贯彻购销结合“三定”到户的步骤一般都是先定产量，后定消费量，然后再定购、销数字。
    各地较好的定产作法有以下几种：
    一、以一九五四年统购时评定的产量为基础，进行适当调整，以确定常年实际产量。一般是去年核产偏差较小的，以户的总产量为基础加以调整；偏差较大的，则对去年核产的等级加以调整，再逐户分丘分等重新登记列册。二、农业合作社以入社产量为基础，适当调整，互助组和单干户分别找同农业合作社同等的田地比照确定（适用于农业合作社较多的地区）。三、以一九五三年实际产量为基础，确定常年实际产量（适用于去年受灾地区）。
    定产是一项极其细致而又艰巨的工作。许多农民对“三定”政策初步懂了，但到具体定产时又不通了。因之，必须强调随时解决思想问题，强调作法对头。根据东乡县邓家乡的典型调查，在定产时全乡瞒产的共六十九户，占总户数的百分之十三点二，瞒产最多的是富农、地主，他们想逃避征购任务。个别农业合作社、互助组，也有集体瞒产的。因此，在定产工作中必须一方面揭露地主、富农故意瞒产的事实，打击他们的破坏活动；另一方面对农民则要进一步进行深入的思想教育，使他们树立热爱国家，支援国家工业化的思想；对农业合作社、互助组主要着重打通社、组工作人员的思想，然后发动社员和组员进一步摸清实产。工作进入到定购、定销阶段时，群众有两种思想：部分农民为了想多留和多得粮食，希望提高消费量标准和多得销量；有些农民有平均主义思想，总是不合理地互相攀比。因此在购销数字规定到户以前，必须反复进行“该购的必须购足，不该购的坚决不购；削减不合理的供应，保证合理供应”的政策教育，说明努力增产，多卖余粮，是光荣的。和这同时，要把计算、造表人员的训练工作作好，并充分掌握田亩转换、人口增减等资料，为购销到户工作作好准备。
    做好定购、定销工作事先必须做好每户用粮量的评议核定工作。
    口粮：各地留口粮的作法有五种：一、根据各户实际需要情况，确定各户的必须口粮数，一般是全乡确定一个统一的口粮标准，然后按大小人口差不多的户；老小弱多的户；劳力多大人多的户分别情况确定每户的必需口粮；二、自报定销；三、按年龄分等，先确定每一等的粮数，然后按等计算出每户留粮数；四、根据前二、三年的实际口粮消费数确定；五、以任务套消费量，能留多少留多少，先完成任务再说。以上五种作法；第一种比较实事求是，符合政策，农民欢迎；第二种在领导上心中有数的情况下，可以试用；第三、四种不容易做到完全合理，一般不宜采用；第五种是违反政策的，不应采用。各地一般是余粮户所留的粮食稍高于缺粮户。对缺粮户的口粮应将今年增产部分加入计算，如缺粮很少的，则动员节约，尽可能不供应或少供应。
    饲料：根据牲畜种类、头数、用粮习惯实地计算。
    种子：一般都是根据实际需要扣留。有的地区为了防止烂秧，并照顾改革耕作技术的需要而稍为多留一点。
    消费标准确定后，即以户为单位，划分余、缺、够的界限。确定定购和定销的数字。
    定购的作法较好的有两种：一、去年购粮基本合理、群众满意的地区，以去年统购任务为基础，根据今年田亩、人口变动情况加以调整即可；二、以计算为主，结合摸底修正偏差，在串联基础上自报互评。
    定销作法多数地区都是按今年计划产量（即包括可靠增产部分）扣除应缴公粮和必须的消费量后，按其不足部分实事求是地确定供应量。但在计算销量时，对缺乏劳力的缺粮户应注意适当放宽一些，因为这些人增产确较困难，如按计划产量确定供应量，将有落空的危险，这将增加今后供应工作的困难。这一点在定销时必须充分估计到。
    同时，在定销中要再三向农民讲清：每年八月至次年二月，为粮食收获季节，在这个时期内，一般地国家不供应粮食，因此，每一个缺粮农民必须严格安排好自己的粮食消费计划，先吃自己的，后吃国家的，并力求节约。
    三、通过总结“三定”工作提高农民的生产积极性
    产、购、销任务到户数字初步确定后，由党支部（有的地区以支部为核心，吸收骨干分子和诚实公正、农民相信的老农参加组织评议小组。）初审一次，把征、购、销总的数字同去年今年的任务数字对比一下，并分户进行一次检查，有多少户是合理的？有多少户还不够合理？特别是去年统购中偏差较大的户，更要周密审查，务使合理。经过初步调整后，以村或选区为单位，发动群众互相评审，个别不合理的经调查属实后再作调整。
    群众评审之后，党支部根据这些材料再作一次修核，然后召开全乡人民代表大会，最后核定，出榜定案，颁发购、销证，编造名册。也有一些地区先出草榜，经群众评议后再出正榜定案。
    各户定案后，即组织农民根据各户征、购任务，讨论制定预售、预送计划，收获后即动员农民送粮。
    工作结束时，通过总结工作，进一步进行“三定”政策的教育，总结“三定”给国家和农民带来的好处，鼓舞农民的生产积极性。
