Anshan Iron and Steel Company has begun training enterprise management personnel in various fields for the Wuhan and Baotou iron and steel complexes. At the end of July, the relevant business departments of Anshan Iron and Steel had already established the first phase of study plans for the interns at the level of independent workshop director and above. The study plans for the remaining trainees are currently being reviewed and revised. During the first phase of study, these interns will not only study cultural and scientific knowledge, but also spend a considerable amount of time participating in various practical works, so as to quickly become experts.

　　After hearing the news that the Wuhan and Baotou iron and steel complexes were preparing for construction, these interns were very excited. Everyone said that they would study diligently and earnestly, strive to complete the study tasks assigned by the Party and the people, and build new iron and steel bases for the motherland. At present, some factory directors and functional department heads are working hard to study cultural courses and familiarize themselves with general production knowledge in order to prepare for further study abroad. Another group of section chief-level interns have also begun professional studies. Those who are progressing faster will soon begin to learn practical operations.

    鞍钢为新钢铁企业培养干部
    鞍山钢铁公司开始为武汉、包头两个钢铁联合企业培养各方面的企业管理人员。鞍钢各有关业务部门，在七月末已经为实习人员中独立车间主任以上的工作人员订好第一期学习计划；其余学习人员的学习计划，目前正在审查和修正中。第一期学习期间，这批实习人员将一方面学习文化科学知识，一方面用相当多的时间参加各项实际工作，以便迅速成为内行。
      这批实习人员听到武汉、包头两个钢铁联合企业准备施工的消息以后，非常兴奋。大家都表示要虚心刻苦学习，努力完成党和人民交给的学习任务，为祖国建设好新的钢铁基地。目前，一部分厂长、各职能处长级工作人员，正努力学习文化课程和熟悉一般性生产知识，为出国深造准备条件。另一部分科长级等实习人员也开始了专业学习。学习进程较快的，即将开始学习实际操作。
