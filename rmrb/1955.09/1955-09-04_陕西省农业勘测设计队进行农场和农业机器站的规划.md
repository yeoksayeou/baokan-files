    The Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Survey and Design Team is conducting survey and design work for state-owned farms and agricultural machinery stations to be established in the province during the first Five-Year Plan.

    During the first Five-Year Plan, the state will establish eight agricultural machinery stations and two mechanized farms in Shaanxi Province. Most of these stations and farms will be built in the Guanzhong Plain, a region rich in wheat and cotton production. In July and August, the province's agricultural survey and design team successively surveyed the sites of five agricultural machinery stations, one farm, and one pasture in Xingping, Chang'an, Dali, Fuping, and Xunyi counties, with a total surveyed area of 4.4 million mu. Currently, the team is conducting land planning and design based on the surveyed data, and has put forward specific opinions on the future operation, building construction, and equipment and personnel allocation of each station and farm, and has made plans and preliminary designs accordingly.

    The two agricultural machinery stations and one mechanized farm previously established in Shaanxi Province will also be expanded this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    陕西省农业勘测设计队进行农场和农业机器站的规划
    陕西省农业勘测设计队正在为本省第一个五年计划期间要建立的国营农场和农业机器站进行勘测设计。
    第一个五年计划期间，国家将在陕西省建立八个农业机器站和两个机械农场。这些站、场大部分将建在关中平原的盛产麦、棉的地区。七、八两个月来，这个省的农业勘测设计队已分别在兴平、长安、大荔、富平、栒邑等县先后勘测了五个农业机器站、一个农场和一个牧场的地址，勘测面积共达四百四十万亩。目前，这个队正根据调查的资料进行土地规划设计，并对将来各站场的经营、房屋建筑及机械、人员的配备等方面提出了具体意见，分别作出了计划和初步设计。
    陕西省过去建立的两个农业机器站和一个机械农场，今年也要扩建。　（新华社）
