Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 30th: According to the suggestions of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission reconvened on the 29th at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

    The meetings of the Subcommittee were held in secret. During the meetings, the texts of the speeches by the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada, who participated in the meetings, were distributed to reporters.

    In his speech, the Soviet representative, Sobolev, emphasized that the Soviet government believes that the primary task in discussing disarmament issues is to bring the attitudes of various countries on this issue closer together and to reach the necessary agreements on the reduction of conventional armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. He said that the Soviet government's May 10th proposals on reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars are precisely to achieve this goal.

    Subsequently, Sobolev reviewed the main points of the Soviet government's above-mentioned proposals, which included: reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons in two stages from 1956 to 1957; stipulating the level of armed forces of major powers after the reduction and convening a world conference to determine the level of armed forces of other countries; ceasing experiments with atomic and hydrogen weapons in the first stage, and countries undertaking a guarantee not to use atomic weapons while starting to take disarmament measures; ceasing the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons in the second stage, and correspondingly reducing military appropriations in national budgets; the agreement to completely prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction coming into effect after 75 percent of the armed forces and conventional armaments have been reduced; implementing effective international supervision measures to supervise the implementation of disarmament measures; developing extensive international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    Sobolev emphasized that the Soviet government's May 10th proposals had already taken into account the wishes expressed by Western countries in their proposals to the Subcommittee and accepted many of their proposals, thus taking a major step forward. The question now lies with the Western countries.

    Sobolev then talked about the essence of the new proposals put forward by the Soviet government at the Geneva Four-Power Summit on July 21st. He said that these proposals are a further development of the Soviet proposals of May 10th, and these proposals have received a good response from the broad masses of the world's society and the governments of many countries in Europe and Asia. However, Western countries have not yet expressed their attitude towards the Soviet proposals. Sobolev hoped that the representatives of the Western countries participating in the meeting would express their views on these proposals in substance.

    Sobolev also talked about the Soviet government's recent two decisions to reduce the Soviet armed forces. He said that the Soviet Union hopes that countries with large armed forces will also take measures to reduce their armed forces without delay. This will further strengthen international trust and provide a realistic basis for resolving the issue of reducing armed forces and prohibiting atomic weapons.

    Sobolev concluded by saying that the recent development of the international situation has created favorable conditions for the Subcommittee to complete its tasks quickly and satisfactorily. He said: The Soviet delegation, as before, is prepared to cooperate with other delegations in solving these important and urgent tasks.

    The United States representative, Lodge, said that the work of the Disarmament Subcommittee should be "the first test of the practical value of the Geneva Conference." He put forward the proposals made by US President Eisenhower at the Geneva Conference. He believes that inspection is the basis of disarmament issues, and said that the United States is prepared to study all aspects of Eisenhower's proposals together with representatives of other countries.

    The British representative, Nutting, pointed out that the Disarmament Subcommittee is beginning its work "in a relatively good and relatively hopeful atmosphere" formed by the Geneva Conference. He emphasized that the Soviet government's May 10th proposals "undoubtedly broadened the possibility of reaching an agreement on some of the objectives of disarmament."

    However, Nutting also stated that he believes that the Soviet proposals did not answer the question of "how these goals can be achieved." He said that the international supervision system for disarmament should be workable in the absence of trust between countries.

    Nutting drew people's attention to the "Eden Plan" put forward at the Geneva Conference.

    The French representative, Moch, believes that the task of establishing effective international supervision is complex, and the issue of the functions of the supervisory body must continue to be studied. Moch submitted to the Subcommittee the proposals put forward by French Prime Minister Faure at the Geneva Four-Power Summit. The proposal advocates establishing financial supervision over military expenditures and using the money saved from reducing armed forces and armaments to aid underdeveloped countries.

    The Canadian representative, Martin, hoped that the meeting would proceed in the atmosphere of the Geneva Summit of the Four Powers. He said that the Canadian government attaches great importance to thoroughly studying the serious proposals put forward by the four countries at the Geneva Summit.

    The Subcommittee continued to meet on the 30th.

    在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议上
    苏联代表阐述苏联的裁军建议
    新华社三十一日讯　据塔斯社纽约三十日讯：根据日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的建议，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会二十九日在纽约联合国大厦复会。
    小组委员会会议是秘密进行的，会议进行中向记者分发了参加会议的苏联、美国、英国、法国、加拿大五国代表的发言稿。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中强调指出，苏联政府认为，在讨论裁军问题的时候，主要的任务在于使各国在这个问题上的态度趋于接近，使各国在裁减常规军备和禁止原子武器问题上取得必要的协议。他说，苏联政府五月十日关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议正是要达到这一目的。
    接着，索波列夫追述了苏联政府上述建议的要点，这些要点包括：在一九五六到一九五七年分两个阶段裁减军备和禁止原子武器；规定各大国武装部队裁减后的水平并且规定召开世界会议确定其他国家的武装部队水平；在第一阶段停止实验原子武器和氢武器，各国在开始采取裁军措施的同时，承担不使用原子武器的保证，在第二阶段停止制造原子武器和氢武器，相应地缩减国家预算中的军事拨款；在武装部队和常规军备裁减掉裁减总额的百分之七十五以后，完全禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的协定即行生效；实行有效的国际监督措施，监督裁军措施的实行；在和平利用原子能方面发展广泛的国际合作。
    索波列夫强调指出，苏联政府五月十日的建议已经考虑了西方国家在它们向小组委员会提出的建议中表示的愿望，接受了它们提出的许多建议，因而向前迈进了一大步。现在问题是在于西方国家方面了。
    索波列夫接着谈到苏联政府七月二十一日在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上提出的新建议的实质。他说，这些建议是五月十日的苏联建议的进一步发展，这些建议得到了世界广大社会人士和欧亚两洲许多国家政府的良好反应。但是，西方国家还没有对苏联的建议表明态度。索波列夫希望参加会议的西方国家代表在实质上对这些建议表示意见。
    索波列夫并且谈到苏联政府最近两次采取的裁减苏联武装部队的决定。他说，苏联希望拥有大量武装部队的国家也毫不延缓地采取裁减武装部队的措施。这样就会进一步加强国际信任，为解决裁减武装部队和禁止原子武器的问题提供现实的基础。
    索波列夫最后说，最近国际局势的发展已经为小组委员会迅速和圆满完成它的任务创造了有利条件。他说：苏联代表团和以前一样，准备在解决这些重要和迫切的任务方面同其他代表团合作。
    美国代表洛奇说，裁军小组委员会的工作应该是“日内瓦会议的实际价值的第一个考验”。他提出了美国总统艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会议上提出的建议。他认为检查是裁军问题的基础，并且说美国准备同其他各国代表一道研究艾森豪威尔的建议的各个方面。
    英国代表纳丁指出，裁军小组委员会是在日内瓦会议形成的“比较良好和比较有希望的气氛中”开始自己的工作的。他着重指出，苏联政府五月十日的建议“无疑地扩大了就裁军的某些目的达成协议的可能”。
    可是，纳丁又表示，他认为苏联的建议没有回答“怎样才能达到这些目的”的问题。他说，关于裁军的国际监督制度要能在缺乏各国间信任的情况下是行得通的。
    纳丁要人们注意在日内瓦会议上提出的“艾登计划”。
    法国代表莫克认为建立有效的国际监督这项任务是复杂的，必须继续研究监督机构的职能的问题。莫克向小组委员会提出法国总理富尔在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上提出的建议。建议主张对军费支出建立财政监督，把裁减武装部队和军备节余下来的钱用来援助落后国家。
    加拿大代表马丁希望会议将在四国政府首脑日内瓦会议的那种气氛中进行。他说，加拿大政府十分重视周密地研究四国在日内瓦政府首脑会议上提出的认真建议。
    小组委员会三十日继续举行会议。
