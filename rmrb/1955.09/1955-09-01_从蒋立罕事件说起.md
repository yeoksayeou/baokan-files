    Starting from the Jiang Lihan Incident
    Fu Zhen
    Some of our naive comrades once believed that the weapons of counter-revolutionaries for sabotage were only handguns and bombs, never imagining that they would also use ink and pens. The recently exposed counter-revolutionary Jiang Lihan, by simply altering a formula on manuscript paper with ink and pen, turned a soda bottle into a "glass bomb." How shocking is that!
    Not long ago, the "Chinese Middle School Students" magazine published an "Important Notice" in various newspapers. It said that the proportions of chemical substances were written incorrectly in the "Making Soda" article in the July issue of "Chinese Middle School Students," and asked everyone to be aware of the danger. It also stated that the original manuscript of the article was without error, and that the editorial department was entirely responsible for the error. Now, this incident has been completely investigated and clarified: it was intentionally created by Jiang Lihan, a counter-revolutionary element hidden within the "Chinese Middle School Students" magazine. Jiang Lihan planned to create an explosion event, turning an interesting scientific activity into a tragic event causing bodily harm. First, Jiang Lihan deliberately tampered with the formula, increasing the proportion of chemicals tenfold; second, he boldly removed the author's original manuscript, slipping past the eyes of two rounds of review and four rounds of proofreading; third, he concealed letters reflecting the explosion accident, attempting to continue expanding his conspiracy. All of this shows how insidious and vicious the counter-revolutionaries are.
    All naive comrades, put away your naiveté! The counter-revolutionaries will not discuss naiveté with us. We need to be a hundred times more vigilant, identifying and purging all kinds of counter-revolutionaries.
    "Flowers in the Mirror" mentions a Two-Faced Nation, where the people have two faces: one face in front of others, and another behind them. Hidden counter-revolutionaries also belong to the people of the Two-Faced Nation. Take Jiang Lihan as an example: in front of others, he was "active and honest," "diligent and conscientious," expressing that "he had stains on his past history, was sorry to the people, and would work hard to serve the people in the future to atone for his crimes." Behind the scenes, he "wanted to create a breakthrough," systematically carrying out a series of acts of sabotage. However, two faces are, after all, two faces. As long as we look at his other face, he cannot but reveal his true colors.
    The Jiang Lihan incident once again warns people, letting everyone learn a lesson from this, and further resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries!

    从蒋立罕事件说起
    傅真
    我们有些天真的同志曾经认为：反革命分子进行破坏的武器，只是手枪和炸弹，没有想到他们也会使用墨水和笔杆。最近揭露的一个反革命分子蒋立罕，就是用墨水和笔杆在稿纸上一涂改，而使汽水瓶变成了“玻璃炸弹”的。这是多么令人吃惊的事情啊！
    不久以前，“中学生”杂志在各报上刊登了一则“重要启事”。里面说：“中学生”七月号上“做汽水”文里的化学药品分量写错了，请大家注意危险。并说：这篇文章的原稿是没有错误的，错误应完全由编辑部负责。现在，这个事故完全查清了，这是暗藏在“中学生”杂志社的反革命分子蒋立罕故意制造出来的。蒋立罕有计划地制造爆炸事件，使有趣味的科学活动，变成伤害人身的惨剧。第一、蒋立罕故意窜改配方，把药品分量增大十倍；第二、大胆的抽掉作者原稿，混过两次审稿、四次校对的眼睛；第三、隐瞒反映发生爆炸事故的信件，企图使他的阴谋继续扩展。这一切，说明反革命分子是如何的阴险和毒辣。
    一切天真的同志们，收敛起自己的天真吧！反革命分子是不同我们讲天真的，我们需要百倍地提高警惕，识别和清查各种各样的反革命分子。
    “镜花缘”里提到一个两面国，两面国的人都有两个脸孔：人前一个脸孔，人后又一个脸孔。暗藏的反革命分子也是属于两面国的人物，以蒋立罕为例：在人前，他“积极老实”、“勤勤恳恳”，表示“过去历史上有污点，对不起人民，今后要好好为人民服务，将功赎罪”。在人后，他“要打出一个缺口来”，有计划地进行了一系列的破坏。但是，两面毕竟是两面，只要我们看看他的另一面，他就不能不原形毕露了。
    蒋立罕事件又一次警告人们，让大家从这里吸取教训，更进一步地坚决彻底地去肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子！
