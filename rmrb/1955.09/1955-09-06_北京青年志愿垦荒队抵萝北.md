The Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team arrived at Tuanjie Village, located twenty li south of Fengxiang Town, Luobei County, Heilongjiang Province, on the 4th, near the opening wasteland site. Ten young people from Huachuan County who came to participate in the reclamation also arrived later with their horses. The technicians from the state-owned Baoquanling Mechanical Farm, who will guide the reclamation team, also came in the same vehicle with the reclamation team.

Before the arrival of the reclamation team, the Luobei Survey Team of the Heilongjiang Survey Bureau had surveyed 20,000 hectares of wasteland. The youth and farmers of Luobei County have prepared all the materials. The farmers in Tuanjie Village vacated eight houses for them to live in temporarily and prepared food, horse feed, vegetables, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and firewood. The reclamation team cooked their own meals for the first time. A farmer volunteered to teach the reclamation team members how to cook.

The reclamation team passed through Jiamusi, Hegang, and Luobei to Tuanjie Village, the wasteland reclamation site. Hundreds of people came to welcome them at each place. The welcoming people all wished the reclamation team success. All the members of the reclamation team were very moved. The captain, Yang Hua, said: We haven't pulled a single blade of grass or reclaimed a single mu of wasteland, yet people welcome us so warmly. We must live up to people's expectations of us.

Shortly after the reclamation team set off from Hegang by car, they entered the vast grassland where no one could be seen for several hours. The team members jumped up excitedly in the car and said: We have arrived at our hometown.

    北京青年志愿垦荒队抵萝北
    北京市青年志愿垦荒队四日到达了黑龙江省萝北县凤翔镇南二十里开荒现场附近的团结村。桦川县前来参加垦荒的十名青年也牵着马随后来到。和垦荒队同车来的还有国营宝泉岭机械农场指导垦荒队的技术员。
    在垦荒队未到以前，黑龙江勘测局萝北勘测总队已勘测出了两万公顷荒地。萝北县的青年和农民把一切物资都已准备齐全。团结村的农民给倒出八间房屋让他们暂住，并准备了食粮、马饲料、菜蔬、油、盐、酱、醋和柴草。垦荒队第一次自己生火造饭了。一个农民自愿教给垦荒队员做饭方法。
    垦荒队路上经过佳木斯、鹤岗、萝北到开荒现场的团结村，每处都有几百人前来欢迎。欢迎的人们都祝垦荒队成功。垦荒队全体队员都很感动。队长杨华说：我们还没有拔一棵草，开一亩荒，人们对我们这样欢迎，我们一定要不辜负人们对我们的期待。
    垦荒队乘汽车从鹤岗出发后不久，就进入汽车行驶几小时不见人烟的大草原，队员们兴奋地在车上跳起来说：我们到了自己的家乡了。
