    Uncle Sam's Chinese Hostages
    by American political writer Shi Kennedy
    The Sino-American talks in Geneva have once again focused world attention on the plight of thousands of Chinese students. For four years, these Chinese students have been forcibly detained in the United States, not allowed to return to their homeland. During this period, these students have been treated like criminals. Large numbers of them have received notices telling them that their visas for residence in the United States would not be extended, while at the same time being told that they were not allowed to return to China. This is an unprecedented action in the history of civilization. In this situation, they are forced to live as "foreigners who have illegally entered the country," and their only way out is to either renounce their Chinese nationality and become American citizens, or agree to work for Uncle Sam in Taiwan or somewhere in the Far East.
    Needless to say, the only way to avoid persecution and the danger of survival, which they are forced to accept, is to stop being Chinese and become Chinese-Americans (which is not a good fate), to join Chiang Kai-shek, or to enter China as agents of the American Central Intelligence Agency.
    During their forced exile, these Chinese students have indeed suffered greatly. Their movements are severely restricted (some are imprisoned), their opportunities to earn a living are restricted to the point where they struggle to survive, and they are subjected to relentless surveillance and interrogation, and ordered to report to the authorities regularly, like a parolee. It should be pointed out that these are people who were invited to the United States to study academics, and their behavior in the United States has all been very law-abiding. Despite all the provocations, they have remained model guests.
    Despite these well-known facts, J.M. Swing (former Lieutenant General of the US Sixth Army), the head of the US Immigration Bureau, recently said, "There is no intention to make trouble for Chinese students." A spokesman for Edward F. Shaughnessy, the head of the New York Immigration Bureau, even said that the authorities were "unaware" of any troubles encountered by any Chinese students and that their desire to return to China was "not a problem."
    "New York Times" reporter Harrison Salisbury, however, had a very different report. He reported that "Chinese students themselves are unwilling to talk, and many of them are willing to talk only when the other party guarantees confidentiality." After first attempting to create the impression that "many people are worried about what might happen when they return to China," Salisbury had to admit that "some people" are afraid of Chiang Kai-shek's agents in the United States, and that "many people are concerned about what they say is coercive treatment by the American immigration authorities." He also reported that many American educators "who do not want to be identified" are concerned about the official treatment of Chinese students.
    What is the living situation of these Chinese youths during their detention in the United States?
    Before leaving the United States, I became friends with many of them, all of whom had doctorates and lived off the small income they earned as waiters in Chinese restaurants in New York City. I found that they were among the lucky ones, having completed their apprenticeship as waiters – washing dishes and wiping tables.
    During a recent visit to China (as the first American guest invited by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries), I spoke with one of the Chinese students who finally managed to leave the United States and return to their homeland.
    His name is Li Hengde. In 1946, he went to the United States along with 34 other Chinese students who had been selected for government scholarships by the Kuomintang Ministry of Education. He studied metallurgy at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh and spent a year at the University of Notre Dame. After obtaining his doctorate, he settled in Philadelphia. There were about two thousand Chinese people in Philadelphia, all struggling to make a living. Engineering companies and industrial companies all refused to hire him, even though he was qualified for their work, because these companies, in addition to producing goods, also accepted "classified" orders from the government. Some employers told Li that they could reconsider his application if he obtained American citizenship.
    "So how did you earn a living?" I asked Li.
    "Sometimes I earned some money by doing manual labor for schools," he replied. "Once I found a job as a draftsman for $1.50 an hour (not even as much as a carpenter earns) – but the job only lasted a month."
    In August 1951, after learning that his mother was ill, Li decided to go home. He went to the British Consulate in Philadelphia and requested a passport to Hong Kong. He received the passport, but before he could buy a ship ticket, someone knocked on the door of his small room at 3737 Locust Street.
    "You are forbidden to leave the United States!" an American immigration official said rudely, while handing him a detention order.
    "Why?" Li asked.
    "We haven't received detailed orders yet, but they should arrive in about two weeks," the official said. "Maybe you can find hundreds of ways to sneak out of the United States, but I advise you not to try any of them."
    On October 22, Li was summoned to the Philadelphia Immigration Bureau, where he was told that he was not allowed to leave the United States because of "the 1918 law and the President's declaration (referring to Truman's declaration of aggression against Korea – translator)."
    "If you try to leave, you will be fined $5,000 or sentenced to five years in prison," they said.
    While Li was in the Immigration Bureau's office, his room was searched.
    In fact, as the whole world knows, the decision to detain Chinese students was a "retaliatory" measure taken after the Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the Korean War. At the same time, this action was intended to prevent the new China from accessing the technical knowledge that these students had acquired, and instead, to force them to serve Chiang Kai-shek or other American plans in the Far East.
    This was all too clear to Li and his companions. Several months later, there was another knock on the door, and two people barged in, flashing badges.
    "We are from the FBI!" they declared. "We want to ask you a few questions!"
    In his application to leave the United States, Li had stated that he could not find work in the United States, that he wanted to return home to visit his relatives, and to marry a young woman to whom he had been engaged earlier in China (Chinese students were expressly forbidden from marrying any Chinese or American while residing in the United States).
    "What if you were offered a good job in the United States or Taiwan, doing research related to our national defense?" the FBI agents asked first.
    Li replied that he still wanted to go home for the other reasons he had given.
    "Maybe your parents have already been killed?" they asked him bluntly.
    "I received letters saying they are in good health," Li explained.
    "What if you had already married someone here?"
    Li said he only wanted to marry his fiancée.
    After that, the FBI agents changed the subject.
    "If you were given the opportunity to return to China, would you be willing to do some work for the United States there?" This was their second question.
    At this point, I interrupted Li's story and asked him, "What do you think they would want you to do?"
    "Undoubtedly, provide some information that they urgently want to know," he replied. "People from the FBI and the CIA have complained to some Chinese students that even the American churches in China have failed to send out any meaningful information since the victory of the revolution. One of my friends was specifically asked to provide information about Shanghai's water supply system."
    When Li stated that he was unwilling to do espionage work that would betray his country, he was asked:
    "If we let you go back, and the Communist government wants you to provide them with information about the United States, would you agree?"
    "I am just an engineer," Li replied.
    "If the United States goes to war with China or the Soviet Union, which side would you fight for?" Then, they wanted to know this.
    "That's a hypothetical question, and I haven't given it much thought," Li said. "I am against war."
    This prompted the FBI agents to ask him detailed questions about his views on the world peace movement and similar issues. Needless to say, his answers did not satisfy the FBI, so he did not receive a passport to leave. So he spent another three years looking for work and barely making ends meet. Every three months, Philadelphia Immigration Bureau Inspector Patrick Cormack inspected his residence.
    The American press did everything possible to conceal the situation of Chinese students from the public, and many of Li's friends—from street vendors to industrial engineers—found it hard to believe that their government would forbid citizens of another country from returning to their homeland.
    Li's experience was better than some. One of his classmates, because he applied for a passport to Hong Kong, had to spend five months in prison on Ellis Island. When he was released, he received the following orders:
    (1) Do not leave the New York area.
    (2) Do not associate with any organization that the Attorney General has placed on the "subversive" list.
    (3) Do not associate with anyone belonging to a group listed on this list.
    (4) Report once a week.
    Another of his friends, obviously thinking things through carefully, applied for a passport to England. Kuomintang officials pressed him closely about his ultimate purpose, and he implied that after visiting friends in England, he might consider going to Taiwan.
    "Don't try to fool us!" the Kuomintang man shouted. "No Chinese student wants to go to Taiwan!"
    He did not get a passport.
    It wasn't until last April—on the eve of the Geneva Conference on Indochina—that Li was suddenly asked if he still wanted to return to China. Shortly after the conference, Li and 21 others were allowed to return home.
    "If you run into any trouble in China, or want to come back to the United States, we will do our best to help you," a CIA agent told one of the students leaving the country.
    But instead of encountering any trouble, Li is now reunited with his family, about to marry his young woman, and has found an ideal teaching job at a university in Beijing.
    "Much of what I learned in the United States has proven to be of little practical value," he told me. "It's all book knowledge, and it has nothing to do with practical production problems. There are many things I have to learn all over again."
    This April, the order to detain Chinese students was "revoked," and replaced with a new order stating that if they did not leave the United States, they would be deported and arrested. But because only a few people have the money to return home, this freedom fell flat, and indeed became a new form of coercion, the intention of which was undoubtedly to drive them into the arms of Chiang Kai-shek.
    Li told me that he had received a letter from a classmate who was still detained in the United States, asking him to visit his friend's elderly parents in the countryside. Li found them, the father was 76 years old, and the mother was 67 years old. Every day, the old father goes to the station to meet the train, hoping that one day his son will get off the train.
    Li also told me that he had visited the wife and two children of another Chinese student detained in the United States. The two children are seven and eight years old. They asked: "Is our dad okay? Why can't he come home?"

    山姆大叔的中国人质
    美国政论作家　史·肯尼迪
    在日内瓦举行的中美会谈使得全世界的视线又一次集中在数千名中国留学生的遭遇上。四年来，这些中国学生被强行阻留在美国，不被允许返回祖国。在这个期间中，这些学生们遭受到像犯人似的待遇。他们大批地接到通知，告诉他们不能延长他们在美国居留的签证，同时又告诉他们说，不允许他们返回中国。这在文明的历史上是从未有过的行动。在这种情况下，他们被迫居于“非法进入本国的外人”的境地，他们的唯一出路，或是放弃他们的中国国籍成为美国公民，或是同意在台湾或远东某地为山姆大叔工作。
    用不着多说，强迫他们接受的避免遭受迫害和生存危险的唯一出路，就是不再做中国人而去当一个美国籍华人（这不是一个什么好命运），投靠蒋介石，或是以美国中央情报局的特务的身份进入中国。
    在被迫流亡的日子里，这些中国学生确实是受尽了折磨。他们的行动受到严格的限制（有的被关在监牢里），他们赚取生计的机会被限制到使他们挣扎于饥饿线上，而且他们受到无情的监视和审讯，还被命令定期向当局报告，跟一个假释的犯人似的。应该指出，他们是一些被请到美国研究学术的人，他们在美国的行为，全都是很循规蹈矩的。在遭到百般的挑衅时，他们仍然保持自己作为一个模范客人的身份。
    尽管这些事实都是人所共知的，美国移民局局长杰·麦·斯文（前美第六军中将军长）不久前还说：“没有意思给中国学生找麻烦。”纽约移民局局长爱德华·伊·萧奈西的一位发言人并且说：当局对任何中国留学生所遇到的麻烦“毫不知情”，对他们的返回中国的愿望“不成为问题”。
    “纽约时报”记者哈里逊·沙里斯柏利却有大不相同的报道。他报道说：“中国学生们自己不愿意谈，他们当中许多人要对方保证守秘密时才愿意谈。”在首先企图造成“许多人担心回到中国时可能出事”的印象后，沙里斯柏利不得不承认说，
  “有的人”害怕在美国的蒋介石特务，而且有“不少人顾虑会受到他们所说的美国移民当局的强制对待。”他还报道说，不少“不愿让人知道是谁的”美国教育家关心着官方对中国学生的待遇。
    这些中国青年在被拘留在美国的期间中的生活状况是怎么样的呢？
    在离开美国前，我和他们当中不少人交上朋友，他们都是得博士学位的人，靠在纽约市的中国餐馆里当侍者的小账收入来维持生活。我发现他们还算是走运的人，他们已完成了当侍者的学徒阶段——洗碗碟和抹桌子。
    在最近访问中国的时候，我（中国人民对外文化协会所邀请的第一名美国客人）曾经同那些终于设法离开了美国回到他们自己祖国的中国留学生中的一个谈过话。
    他名叫李恒德，在一九四六年和其他三十四个考取国民党教育部的留学生名额的中国学生一道到美国。他在匹兹堡的卡内基工学院念冶金学，并且在诺脱尔达摩大学读了一年。取得了博士学位以后，他在费城居住下来。在费城有两千名左右的中国人，他们都在竭力寻找生计。工程公司和工业公司全都异口同声地拒绝雇用他，尽管他对这些公司的工作是胜任的，因为这些公司除了生产商品以外，还接受了政府的“机密”订货。有一些雇主告诉李说，如果他取得美国公民籍的话，他们可以重新考虑他的申请。
    “那末你如何挣得一口饭吃的呢？”我问李道。
    “有时我替学校做手工赚一些钱，”他回答说。“有一次我曾经找到一个每小时一块半美元的绘图员的工作（还赶不上一个木匠的收入）——但是这个工作只做了一个月。”
    一九五一年的八月，在知道母亲生病的消息之后，李决定回家。他到费城的英国领事馆去，请求发给他去香港的护照。他收到了护照，但是在他买到船票之前，有人来敲他的在蝗虫大街三七三七号的斗室之门。
    “你被禁止离开美国！”一个美国移民局的官员粗暴地说，同时交给他一纸拘留令。
    “为什么？”李问道。
    “我们还没有接到详细的命令，但是大约两个星期内就可以收到的，”那个官员说。“也许你可以找出成百条溜出美国的方法，但是我劝你那一个方法也不要去试。”
    十月二十二日，李被召唤到费城移民局，在那儿他被告诉说，他之所以不被允许离开美国，是由于“一九一八年法令和总统的宣言（指杜鲁门的侵朝宣言——译者）。”
    “假若你企图离开，你将受到罚款五千元或五年徒刑的处分。”他们又说。
    当李在移民局的办公室里的时候，他的房间被搜查了。
    事实上，正如全世界所知道的，拘留中国学生的决定，乃是在中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战争后采取的“报复性”措施。同时，这种行动是要不让新中国接触这些学生已获得的技术知识，相反，倒要强迫他们为蒋介石服务，或是为美国在远东的其他计划服务。
    这对李和他的同伴们是再清楚不过了。在几个月之后，又一次敲门声，两个人闯进来，亮一亮证章。
    “我们是从联邦调查局来的！”他们宣称。“我们要问你几个问题！”
    在要求离开美国的申请书上，李曾经声称，他在美国找不到工作，他要回家省亲，并且跟早先在中国订婚的少女结婚（中国学生被明令禁止在美国居留时期中和任何中国人或美国人结婚）。
    “假如在美国或台湾给你一个好差使，作同我们的国防有关的研究工作呢？”联邦调查局的来人先问道。
    李回答说，为了他所提出的其他理由，他还是想要回家。
    “也许你的父母已被杀害了呢？”他们直截了当地问他。
    “我收到信说他们的身体很好，”李解释说。
    “要是你已在这儿跟别人结了婚呢？”
    李说，他只愿跟他的未婚妻成婚。
    之后，联邦调查局的特务改换了题目。
    “假如给你回到中国去的机会，你是否将愿意为美国在那边做些工作呢？”这是他们的第二个问题。
    谈到这里，我打断李的谈话问他说：“你以为他们会要你做些什么呢？”
    “无疑地，供给一些他们迫切想知道的情报，”他回答说。“联邦调查局和中央情报局的人曾经向一些中国学生抱怨说，自从革命胜利以后，连在中国的美国教会也未能送出过任何有意义的情报来。我的一个朋友被专门要求供给关于上海的自来水供应系统的情报。”
    当李声明他不愿作背叛祖国的特务工作时候，他被问道：
    “假如我们让你回去，而共产党政府要你供给他们关于美国的情报，你会答应吗？”
    “我只是一个工程师，”李回答说。
    “假若美国同中国或苏联交战，你将为那一方面打仗呢？”之后，他们想知道这一点。
    “那是一个假想的问题，我还不曾怎么考虑到，”李说。“我是反对战争的。”
    这促使联邦调查局的人周密地追问他对于世界和平运动的看法，以及类似的问题。不用说，他的答案未能满足联邦调查局的心意，于是他得不到离境护照。于是又渡过三年的找工作和勉强维持生活的时光。每三个月一次，费城移民局的检察官柏德力克·柯迈来视察他的住所。
    美国报刊竭尽全力向公众掩盖中国学生的境况，而李的许多朋友——从街头的报贩到工业工程师，简直很难相信他们的政府竟会禁止别国的公民回到他们的祖国去。
    比起有些人来，李的遭遇还算是好的。他的一个同学因为申请到香港的护照，不得不在艾利斯岛上的监狱里捱过五个月的光阴，在被释放的时候，他接到命令：
    （一）不得离开纽约区。
    （二）不得与任何被检察长列入“颠覆性”名单的组织来往。
    （三）不得与任何属于列入这种名单的团体的人来往。
    （四）每星期一来报告一次。
    他的另一位朋友，显然想得很周到，申请到英国去的护照。国民党官员紧紧追问他的最终目的，他暗示他在看望过在英国的朋友以后，可能考虑到台湾去。
    “别想愚弄我们了！”国民党人喊道。“没有那一个中国学生愿意到台湾去！”
    他没有得到护照。
    直到去年四月——讨论印度支那问题的日内瓦会议前夕，李突然被询问他是不是还要求回到中国。会议结束后不久，李和其他二十一人得到允许回国。
    “假如你在中国遇到了什么麻烦，或是想回到美国来，我们将尽力帮助你。”一个中央情报局的特务对一个离境的学生说。
    但是，不但没有遇到什么麻烦，李现在已经和家人团聚了，快要和他的少女结婚了，并在北京的大学找到一个理想的教学工作。
    “我在美国所学到的有许多都证明了没有多大的实际价值，”他对我说。“那都是书本上的知识，和实际生产中的问题毫不相干。有许多东西我不得不重头学起。”
    今年四月，拘留中国学生的命令“取消”了，取而代之的，出了一道新的命令，那就是假如他们不离开美国的话，他们将被驱逐出境和逮捕。但是因为只有很少人有回国的路费，这个自由落了空，而且确实成为新的强制形式，其用意无疑是驱使他们投入蒋介石的怀抱。
    李告诉我说，他收到了一位仍被拘留在美国的同学的来信，要求他去探望他的朋友在乡下的老父母。李找到了他们，父亲年已七十六岁，母亲六十七岁。每天，老父亲到车站上接火车，希望总有一天他的儿子会从车上下来。
    李还告诉我，他访问过另一个被拘留在美国的中国学生的妻子和他的两个孩子。两个孩子一个年方七岁，另一个八岁了。他们问道：“我们的爸爸好吗？他为什么不能回家来呢？”
