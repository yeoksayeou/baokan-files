Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 4th: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 4th: The spokesperson of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army refuted on the 3rd the Cambodian Royal Government's fabrication regarding the so-called "Viet Minh attack" on Veun Sai in Stung Treng province, Cambodia.

After recounting the statement by the Cambodian Royal Government authorities on this matter, the spokesperson of the Vietnamese People's Army stated: "Everyone knows that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam consistently adheres to a policy of respecting and strictly implementing the Geneva Accords. The implementation of the clauses regarding ceasefire, troop withdrawal and transfer, and other clauses signed at the Geneva Conference proves this."

The spokesperson continued: "From a diplomatic point of view, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is committed to establishing good relations with its neighbors, Cambodia and Laos. President Ho Chi Minh and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong have stated this on numerous occasions.

"Conversely, the Cambodian Royal Government has taken actions that seriously violate the Geneva Accords. Particularly serious are the signing of the US-Cambodia military aid agreement and the suppression of former resistance personnel. This irrefutably proves that the Cambodian Royal Government's argument regarding the so-called 'Viet Minh attack' on Cambodia is completely fabricated."

The spokesperson continued: "From a geographical point of view, the territory currently under the control of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam does not share a common border with Cambodia. It is almost impossible to launch a military operation against Cambodia from the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam without passing through Laos or South Vietnam, which is currently an area of temporary assembly for French Union forces."

The spokesperson emphasized, "The Cambodian Royal Government's claim is without basis." He added: "The purpose of this conspiracy is to deceive the Cambodian people and world public opinion, and to use it as a pretext to persecute individuals and organizations that are competing with the Royal Government in the current election campaign, as well as those who oppose the US-Cambodia military aid agreement."

The spokesperson concluded: "In the name of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, we resolutely refute the aforementioned unfounded claims by the Cambodian Royal Government. We also believe it is necessary to expose this conspiracy by the US imperialists and the Cambodian Royal Government to the Cambodian people and the whole world."

    越南人民军总司令部发言人
    驳斥柬埔寨方面捏造“越盟进攻”的谰言
    新华社河内四日电　越南通讯社四日讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人三日驳斥了柬埔寨王国政府关于所谓“越盟进攻”柬埔寨上丁省云晒的谰言。
    越南人民军发言人在叙述柬埔寨王国政府当局关于这方面的声明以后说：“大家都知道，越南民主共和国政府坚持不渝地遵循着一贯尊重和严格执行日内瓦协定的政策。关于停火、军队的撤退和转移的条款和日内瓦会议上签订的其他条款的执行就证明了这一点。”
    发言人接着说：“从外交观点来看，越南民主共和国政府承允同邻国柬埔寨和老挝建立良好关系。胡志明主席和范文同副总理兼外交部长曾多次说明这一点。
    “相反地，柬埔寨王国政府却采取了严重违反日内瓦协定的行动。特别严重的是签订美国—柬埔寨军事援助协定和镇压前抗战人员。这不容置辩地证明柬埔寨王国政府关于所谓‘越盟进攻’柬埔寨的论调完全是凭空捏造的。”
    发言人继续说：“从地理的观点来说，目前在越南民主共和国政府控制下的领土同柬埔寨没有共同的边界。不通过老挝或现在是法兰西联邦部队临时集结区的南越而要从越南民主共和国的领土上对柬埔寨采取军事行动，这几乎是不可能的。”
    发言人强调指出，“柬埔寨王国政府的说法是没有根据的。”他又说：“这种阴谋的目的在于欺骗柬埔寨人民和世界舆论，在于利用它作为迫害那些在目前的竞选运动中同王国政府竞争的个人和组织，以及那些反对美柬军事援助协定的人的一种借口。”
    发言人最后说：“我们以越南人民军总司令部的名义坚决驳斥柬埔寨王国政府上述毫无根据的说法。我们还认为有必要向柬埔寨人民和全世界揭露美帝国主义者和柬埔寨王国政府这一方面的阴谋。”
