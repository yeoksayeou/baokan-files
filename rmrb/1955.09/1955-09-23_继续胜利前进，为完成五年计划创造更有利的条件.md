The State Statistical Bureau has released a communique on the results of the 1954 national economic development and state plan execution. This communique concentrates on demonstrating the significant achievements made by the people of our country in the second year of the first Five-Year Plan. These achievements have allowed our country to take another step forward on the road to socialism.

In 1954, the investment in capital construction completed by various industrial departments increased by 31 percent compared to 1953. There were 411 construction units above the quota under construction. The investment completed in railway construction increased by 43 percent compared to 1953. The scale of various constructions such as highways, water conservancy, cultural education, and urban public utilities also expanded compared to 1953. In 1954, China's industrial and agricultural production, transportation and postal services, domestic and foreign trade, cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and people's living standards all achieved further development and improvement. The total national industrial output value increased by 17 percent compared to 1953, of which state-owned industry increased by 27 percent. Although agricultural production in some areas suffered from floods and did not complete the planned targets, the output of grain among agricultural products still increased slightly compared to 1953. Except for cotton, whose output was lower than the 1953 level, the output of industrial crops such as jute, sugarcane, sugar beet, flue-cured tobacco, rapeseed, and peanuts were all higher than or equal to the 1953 levels.

The results of the 1954 national economic plan execution show that our country's socialist economic strength has gained new growth, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist economy has achieved further success. In 1954, the proportion of state-owned industry, cooperative industry, and joint state-private industry in the total national industrial output value increased from 62 percent in 1953 to 75 percent. The proportion of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in the total wholesale volume of pure commercial institutions nationwide increased from about 69 percent in 1953 to about 89 percent. The agricultural cooperative movement also developed rapidly this year. Compared with 1953, the number of participating farm households increased sevenfold, and the cultivated land area increased fivefold. By the end of 1954, nearly 500,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives had been developed. Various forms of state capitalist economy grew rapidly this year. The proportion of joint state-private industrial output value in the total national industrial output value increased from 5.7 percent in 1953 to 12 percent. The vast majority of private industrial products have been processed, ordered, and purchased and sold by the state. There has also been considerable development in the consignment, agency sales, agency purchases, and joint state-private commercial activities in private commerce.

The achievements made by various sectors of the national economy in 1954 once again prove that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are capable of overcoming various difficulties and successfully realizing the various targets set by China's first Five-Year Plan. However, this does not mean that there are no more difficulties in completing and striving to over fulfill the various targets set by the Five-Year Plan. In order to fully realize the Five-Year Plan, great efforts are still needed in the latter three years of the Five-Year Plan. At present, the people of the whole country especially need to work hard to ensure the completion and strive to over fulfill the 1955 plan for developing the national economy.

According to the inspection of the plan execution in the first half of 1955 by planning agencies, statistical agencies, and relevant departments, the industrial production plan and the planting plan for grain and cotton in the first half of the year have been over fulfilled. Great achievements have been made in saving on capital construction. The freight volume of railways and waterways has increased compared to the same period in 1954. The turnover of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce has continued to expand under the unified arrangement of private commerce. These are great achievements. However, it should also be pointed out that the trial production plan for new products in the first half of the year has not been completed by various industrial departments. Some products are of poor quality, and shortcomings such as frequent accidents and large waste have not been well overcome. Many capital construction departments have not completed the planned workload, and the commercial department and the cooperative system have not completed the purchase and sales plans. These situations must be given serious attention by all departments and all localities.

In view of the unsatisfactory implementation of the plan in the first half of 1955, all departments, all localities, and all enterprises and institutions must strengthen their work in the next three months and more, mobilize forces from all sides, and comprehensively and over fulfill the 1955 plan. In particular, all employees of the capital construction departments should strive to complete the progress of the project, ensure the quality of the project, and especially ensure the quality and progress of those productive major construction projects.

In order to comprehensively and over fulfill the national plan, attention must be paid to strengthening work in several aspects.

First of all, it is necessary to further inspire the labor enthusiasm of workers, peasants, and other working people, and improve their political awareness, so that they can fully develop their initiative and creativity, and consciously contribute their strength and wisdom to the socialist construction of the motherland. Any tendency to neglect politics, or to separate economic work from political work and the leadership of the Party, must continue to be resolutely overcome. Only when every working people can consciously struggle for the cause of socialist construction can the realization of the national plan have a reliable foundation.

At the same time, all state organs, especially enterprise departments and enterprise units, should regard the national plan as law, strive to improve the level of management, overcome all difficulties, and formulate and complete advanced plans. Many state organs and state-owned enterprises lack a serious attitude and spirit of overcoming difficulties in completing the national plan, and often use conservative views as the ideological guidance for formulating plans, and are unwilling to adopt advanced quotas and experience. Some enterprises often fail to complete the plan, or although they have completed the output targets, they have not completed the quality and variety targets, or have not completed the labor, cost, finance, and profit delivery targets. Many enterprises have caused very uneven phenomena in the execution of the plan due to being sometimes tight and sometimes loose, first loose and then tight, and loose here and tight there. Even some enterprise departments and enterprise units only care about themselves and do not care about others, thus disrupting the plans of other departments and affecting the entire national plan. This must be corrected.

Resolutely implementing the Party and state policies, and publicizing these policies to the masses, is the regular task of all state organs and enterprise units. We must continue to resolutely implement the Party and state policies on actively implementing socialist industrialization, on agricultural cooperation, on socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, on overall consideration and comprehensive arrangements for various economic components, and on planned purchase and planned supply of grain and other consumer goods. Some deviations have occurred in some places and some departments in the process of implementing the Party and state policies, and they must be corrected immediately. Party organizations and state organs at all levels must earnestly study the Party and state policies, and continuously strengthen policy education among staff members, so as to further improve their work and implement the policies among the masses.

In view of the existing experience in implementing the national plan in the past, all departments and all localities must adopt a positive spirit and advanced standards when formulating plans in the future, and oppose backward and conservative tendencies. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of comprehensive economy and the existing experience in economy, we must carefully plan and calculate, and directly stipulate the potential forces of economy in all aspects within various planning indicators, and make economy a regular system. And on this basis, all departments and all localities must also strive to ensure and continuously improve quality, improve technical level, and use more and better labor results to meet the needs of the country and the people.

### 继续胜利前进，为完成五年计划创造更有利的条件

    继续胜利前进，为完成五年计划创造更有利的条件
    国家统计局公布了关于一九五四年度国民经济发展和国家计划执行结果的公报。这个公报集中地表明了我国人民在第一个五年计划的第二个年度中所取得的重大成就。这些成就，使得我们国家在向着社会主义前进的道路上又迈进一步。
    一九五四年各工业部完成的基本建设的投资额比一九五三年增加了百分之三十一，施工的限额以上的建设单位有四百一十一个；铁路建设完成的投资额比一九五三年增加了百分之四十三；公路、水利、文化教育、城市公用事业等各种建设的规模也都比一九五三年扩大了。在一九五四年，我国的工农业生产，运输和邮电，国内外贸易，文化教育卫生事业和人民生活水平，也获得了进一步的发展和提高。全国工业总产值比一九五三年增加了百分之十七，其中国营工业增长了百分之二十七；农业生产虽有一些地区遭受了洪水灾害而没有完成预定计划，但农产品中粮食的产量比一九五三年仍略有增加，技术作物除棉花的产量低于一九五三年的水平以外，黄麻、甘蔗、甜菜、烤烟、油菜籽、花生等作物的产量都高于或相等于一九五三年的水平。
    一九五四年国民经济计划执行的结果表明，我国社会主义经济力量又有新的增长，对农业、手工业和资本主义经济的社会主义改造，取得了进一步的成就。一九五四年，国营工业、合作社营工业和公私合营工业在全国工业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之六十二上升到百分之七十五。国营商业和合作社营商业在全国纯商业机构批发总额中所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之六十九左右上升到百分之八十九左右。这一年农业合作化事业也有迅速发展，同一九五三年比较，参加的农户增加了七倍，耕地面积增加了五倍；到一九五四年底，农业生产合作社已发展到将近五十万个。这一年各种形式的国家资本主义经济有了迅速的增长，公私合营工业的产值在全国工业总产值中的比重已由一九五三年的百分之五点七上升为百分之十二，私营工业产品的绝大部分已由国家加工定货和统购包销；私营商业中经销、代销、代购和公私合营的商业也有相当的发展。
    一九五四年度国民经济各部门取得的成就，再一次证明了中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，能够战胜各种困难，胜利实现我国第一个五年计划所规定的各种指标。但是，这决不是说完成和争取超额完成五年计划所规定的各种指标就再没有困难了。为了全部实现五年计划，在五年计划的后三年中，还需要很大的努力。目前，全国人民特别需要努力保证完成和争取超额完成一九五五年度的发展国民经济的计划。
    根据计划机关、统计机关和有关部门对一九五五年上半年的计划执行情况的检查，上半年的工业生产计划、粮食和棉花的播种计划都超额完成了，基本建设在节约方面取得了很大的成绩，铁路和水运的货运量都比一九五四年同期有所增长，在统筹安排私营商业的情况下国营商业和合作社商业的营业额继续扩大。这是很大的成绩。但是，还应该指出，各工业部门上半年的新产品试制计划没有完成，有些产品质量不好，事故多和浪费大等缺点也还没有很好地克服；不少的基本建设部门没有完成工作量的计划，商业部和合作社系统都没有完成收购和销售的计划。这些情况，必须引起各部门、各地方的严重注意。
    鉴于一九五五年上半年执行计划的情况不够好，各部门、各地方和一切企业、事业单位，必须加强今后三个多月的工作，动员各方面的力量，全面地和超额地完成一九五五年度的计划。特别是基本建设部门的全体职工，应该努力完成工程的进度，保证工程的质量，尤其是要保证那些生产性的重大的建设工程的质量和进度。
    为要全面地和超额地完成国家计划，必须注意从几个方面来加强工作。
    首先，必须进一步地鼓舞工人、农民和其他劳动人民的劳动热情，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们充分地发挥积极性和创造性，自觉地把力量和智慧贡献给祖国的社会主义建设事业。任何忽视政治的倾向，使经济工作脱离政治工作和党的领导的倾向必须继续地坚决地加以克服。只有每个劳动人民都能够自觉地为社会主义建设事业奋斗的时候，国家计划的实现才有可靠的基础。
    同时，一切国家机关特别是企业部门和企业单位应该把国家计划当成法律，努力提高管理工作的水平，克服一切困难，制定和完成先进的计划。有许多国家机关和国营企业，对于完成国家计划缺乏认真的严肃的态度和克服困难的精神，常常以保守的观点作为制定计划的思想指导，不愿意采取先进的定额和经验。有些企业经常地完不成计划，或者虽然完成了产量的指标，但并没有完成质量和品种的指标，或者没有完成劳动、成本、财务和上缴利润的指标。许多企业在执行计划中由于时松时紧、先松后紧、此松彼紧而造成了很不均衡的现象。甚至有些企业部门和企业单位，只顾自己，不顾别人，因而打乱了其他部门的计划，并影响到国家的整个计划。这是必须加以纠正的。
    坚决地贯彻党和国家的各项政策，并且向群众宣传这些政策，是一切国家机关和企业单位的经常任务。我们必须继续坚决执行党和国家关于积极地实行社会主义工业化的政策，关于农业合作化的政策，关于对私营工商业实行社会主义改造的政策、关于各种经济成份统筹兼顾、全面安排的政策和关于粮食等消费品计划收购和计划供应的政策。有些地方和有些部门在执行党和国家的政策的过程中曾经发生过若干偏差，必须立即纠正。各级党的组织和国家机关，必须认真地研究党和国家的政策，并不断地在工作人员中加强政策教育，以便进一步地做好工作，把政策贯彻到群众中去。
    鉴于过去执行国家计划已有的经验，各部门、各地方今后在制定计划的时候，必须采取积极的精神和先进的标准，反对落后和保守倾向。同时，应该根据全面节约的精神和已有的节约经验，精打细算，把各方面节约的潜在力量直接规定在各种计划指标之内，并使节约成为经常的制度。而在这个基础上，各部门、各地方还必须努力保证和不断提高质量，提高技术水平，用更多更好的劳动成果来满足国家和人民的需要。
