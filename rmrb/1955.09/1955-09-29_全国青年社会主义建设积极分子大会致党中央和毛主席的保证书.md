To the respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

We, the one thousand five hundred and twenty-seven young people attending the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism, entrusted by our young comrades from all fronts of the motherland, with the most sincere hearts, extend our highest respect to our most respected Party Central Committee, our great leader and mentor!

We, the young generation of New China, are growing healthily under the cultivation, education, and care of the Party. Each of us feels happy and proud to be born in this era. But even as we feel happy, we have not forgotten the bitter past and difficult childhood of our generation. It is only because of the complete victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution under the leadership of our Party that we, the children who suffered insults and harm in the old society, can become masters of the country.

The Party has shown our young generation the direction of progress and a bright future—socialism and communism. Chairman Mao instructed us to be "good in health, good in study, and good in work" and to dedicate all our energy to this magnificent cause. The Party Central Committee's instructions for this congress once again express the Party's trust and hope in our young generation. Every young person understands that without the Communist Party, there would be no freedom and happiness for us today; without following the socialist path led by the Party, there would be no bright future for young people.

We have made a little bit of insignificant achievement and have received the attention of the Party and the state, which will only increase our courage to move forward, because we understand that every progress and every moment of joy in our lives and work is inseparable from the help of our elders and peers, and inseparable from the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao. We will never fail the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao. We solemnly make the following guarantees to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

	We will use honest, tenacious, and creative labor, together with the people of the whole country, to build our motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist country. We will actively participate in labor competitions, devote ourselves to the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive for the socialist industrialization of our motherland. We will actively participate in the agricultural cooperation movement and build our hometowns into happy and beautiful new socialist villages. We will firmly adhere to any work post assigned to us by the motherland and do every ordinary and small job that is beneficial to socialism. We will inherit and carry forward the tradition of hard struggle of our revolutionary elders and overcome all the difficulties in front of us.

	We will learn modestly and diligently, strive to study politics, and constantly improve our socialist consciousness; strive to study culture, master technology, and march toward science. We will learn from revolutionary elders and from the working people at all times and in all places, and avoid any vanity and pride.

	We will raise our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold and resolutely launch a relentless struggle against domestic and foreign enemies and all bad people and bad deeds that endanger the socialist cause. When the motherland needs us, we will immediately take up arms and rush to the battlefield to defend the motherland. We will do everything in our power to defend the victory of the socialist cause.

Respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will firmly remember your instructions and unswervingly advance bravely on the road to socialism. We are determined to be good sons and daughters of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and promising successors to the revolutionary elders. We will hold high the banner of socialism and march towards the final victory.

    全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会致党中央和毛主席的保证书敬爱的党中央和毛主席：
    我们，参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的一千五百二十七个年轻人，受着祖国各个战线上年轻伙伴们的委托，怀着最赤诚的心意，向我们最敬爱的党中央、我们伟大的领袖和导师致最崇高的敬礼！
    我们，新中国的年轻一代，正在党的培养、教导和关怀下健全地成长，我们每个人都以生长在这个时代而感到幸福和自豪。但就在我们感到幸福的时刻，也并没有忘记我们这一代曾有过辛酸的过去和苦难的童年。只是因为有我们党领导中国人民民主革命的彻底胜利，才使我们这些在旧社会遭受侮辱和损害的孩子们能够做国家的主人。
    党为我们年轻一代指明了前进的方向和美好的将来——社会主义和共产主义。毛主席嘱咐我们要“身体好、学习好、工作好”，把自己的全部心力献给这个壮丽的事业。党中央对我们这次大会的指示，再一次表达了党对我们年轻一代的信任和希望。我们每一个青年都明白：没有共产党，就没有我们今天的自由和幸福；不跟着党走社会主义的路，就没有青年人的光明前途。
    我们作出了一点点微小的成绩，就受到了党和国家的重视，这只会增加我们前进的勇气，因为我们懂得：在我们生活和工作中的每一点进步，每一刻的欢乐，都是同周围的长辈和同辈们的帮助分不开的，都是同党和毛主席的教导分不开的。我们决不辜负党和毛主席的教导，我们谨向党中央和毛主席庄严地提出自己的保证：
    我们一定要用诚实的、顽强的、创造性的劳动，和全国人民一道，把祖国建设成一个繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家。我们要积极参加劳动竞赛，投入增产节约运动，为祖国的社会主义工业化而奋斗。我们要积极参加农业合作化运动，把自己的家乡建设成幸福美丽的社会主义的新农村。我们要坚守祖国交给自己的任何一个工作岗位，做好每一件有利于社会主义的平凡、细小的工作。我们要继承和发扬革命长辈的艰苦奋斗的传统，战胜横在我们面前的一切困难。
    我们一定要虚心地刻苦地学习，努力学习政治，不断提高自己的社会主义觉悟；努力学习文化，掌握技术，向科学进军。我们要随时随地向革命长辈学习，向劳动人民学习，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲。
    我们一定要千百倍地提高革命警惕性，坚决地同国内外敌人和一切危害社会主义事业的坏人坏事展开无情的斗争。当祖国需要的时候，我们就立刻拿起武器，奔向保卫祖国的战场。我们要尽自己的一切力量来保卫社会主义事业的胜利。
    敬爱的党中央和毛主席，我们一定要牢牢记住您们的指示，坚定不移地向着社会主义道路英勇前进。我们决心做共产党和毛主席的好儿女，做革命长辈有出息的接班人。我们一定要高举着社会主义的旗帜走向最后的胜利。
                    一九五五年九月二十八日
