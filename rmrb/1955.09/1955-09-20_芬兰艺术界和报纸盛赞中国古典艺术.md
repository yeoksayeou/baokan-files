Finnish art circles and newspapers have unanimously praised the performances of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe in Helsinki and Turku, Finland.

Finnish art figures regard the performance of Chinese classical opera and dance in their country as a major event. Actors from the National Theatre said that it was an honor and a joy for them to have such a good troupe performing in their theatre. They had originally planned to stage their own drama program these days, but they gladly gave up the venue to the Chinese troupe and postponed their own performance. After watching the first performance, Yavi Luo, a famous actress and director, said that when the troupe finishes its visit to Finland, she must learn to perform "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet."

Helsinki newspapers unanimously gave high praise to Chinese classical art. The "Helsinki News" said in its commentary that this Chinese opera with a long tradition "organically combines singing, music, dance, pantomime, martial arts and dramatic dialogue. For Western audiences, it opens up a very fresh and soul-stirring world in terms of artistic expression."

"Evening News" commented on almost every performance staged by the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe. It praised "the lyrical and elegant image like 'Peach Blossom on Human Face'," and said that every movement of the actors "makes people deeply respect the labor, wisdom and ancient tradition combined in this movement." It said that "the change in the mood of the young girl in 'Picking Up the Jade Bracelet' is expressed so clearly and innocently that language difficulties do not hinder people's understanding and appreciation." Commenting on "The Crossroads Inn," it said that this "scene full of fun, excitement and comedy is performed with convincing artistic taste and brilliant action skills."

"Newspaper" commented: "This stage art passed down from generation to generation seems strange to us Westerners, but the more we see it, the more intense its charming power becomes. The music and singing are the most difficult for us to understand, but dance, pantomime and martial arts are languages that are understood everywhere."

"Labor People's Daily" commented: "Finnish audiences have the opportunity to come into contact with this unparalleled art, and they have reason to feel happy."

An editorial published by "Free Talk Newspaper" pointed out that the Chinese troupe's performance has achieved great success and left a deep impression on the Finnish public. The editorial expressed the hope that the cultural contact between China and Finland will not be limited to this visit. The editorial said: "In many other areas, we will find more opportunities to meet and learn from each other."

Two famous actresses from Turku expressed their admiration for Chinese classical art to Xinhua News Agency reporters, saying: We don't need to understand every word in the play, because every movement is so meticulous and has so much meaning that anyone who sees it will understand.

Turku's "New Aura Newspaper" believes that the performance was a great success. "Turan Sanomat" said that Chinese classical opera and dance is an unforgettable art, and its performance has captured the hearts of the people of Turku. "Turan Taivalanti" believes that the storm of applause from the performance shows that China's highly developed art and skills have deeply impressed people from all walks of life in Turku.

Astirin, an actor and director at the Turku Swedish Theatre, said to Chinese actor Yun Yanming: I cannot express my feelings for your art, I can only say: Your coming here and allowing us to see China's ancient and beautiful artistic traditions is a great gift to us.

    芬兰艺术界和报纸盛赞中国古典艺术
    中国古典歌舞剧团在芬兰赫尔辛基和土库的演出，受到芬兰艺术界人士和报纸的一致的赞扬。
    芬兰艺术界人士把中国古典歌舞在他们国家的演出看作一件大事。国家剧院的演员们说，有这样好的剧团在他们剧院演出，是他们的光荣和幸福。他们原定在这几天上演自己的戏剧节目，可是他们很高兴地把场地让给中国剧团而推迟了自己的演出。著名的女演员兼导演亚维罗在看了首次演出以后说，等到剧团结束在芬兰的访问演出时，她一定要学会表演“拾玉镯”。
    赫尔辛基的报纸对中国古典艺术一致给了高度的评价。“赫尔辛基新闻”在评论中说，这种有悠久传统的中国歌剧“把歌唱、音乐、舞蹈、哑剧、武功和戏剧道白有机地结合在一起。对于西方观众来说，它在艺术的表现方面打开了一个十分新鲜的和动人心魄的天地”。
    “晚报”评论了中国古典歌舞剧团上演的几乎每一个剧目。它赞美“像‘人面桃花’一个那样抒情诗似的美丽典雅的形象”，它说，演员的每一个动作都“使人们对于结合在这动作里的劳动、智慧和古老的传统深为尊重”。它说，“拾玉镯”里“那种青年姑娘的心情的变化是表现得这样清楚无邪，以至于语言上的困难并不能妨碍人们的理解和欣赏”。评论在谈到“三岔口”时说，这个“充满着趣味、激动和笑剧的场面，是用令人信服的艺术趣味和光辉的动作技巧来演出的”。
  “新报”评论说：“这种世代传续下来的舞台艺术看来对于我们西方人似乎是陌生的，但是，我们看得越多，它的迷人的力量也就变得更加强烈。那种音乐和歌唱对于我们是最难懂的，但是舞蹈、哑剧和武功却是无处不懂的语言。”
    “劳动人民报”评论说：“芬兰观众有机会接触到这种无比的艺术，他们有理由感到幸福。”
    “自由谈报”发表的社论指出，中国剧团的演出获得了巨大的成功并且给芬兰公众以深刻的印象。社论表示希望中芬两国的文化接触不仅限于这次访问。社论说：“在其他许多方面，我们将找到更多的机会来彼此见面和互相学习。”
    土库的两个著名女演员对新华社记者表示对中国古典艺术的钦佩，她们说：我们用不着了解剧中的每一句话，因为每一个动作都是那样细致而又有那样多的意义，谁看了都会懂得。
    土库的“新奥拉报”认为演出是一个巨大的成功。“土兰·萨诺曼特报”说，中国古典歌舞剧是令人不能忘记的艺术，它的演出占领了土库人的心。“土兰·泰伐兰第报”认为，从演出所得到的暴风雨般的掌声中可以看出中国的高度发展了的艺术和技巧深深地得到了土库各界人士的钦佩。
    土库瑞典语剧院的演员和导演阿斯梯林对中国演员云燕铭说，我无法表达我对你们的艺术的感情，我只能说：你们来到这里并且使我们看到中国古老而优美的艺术传统，这就是给了我们莫大的礼物。　（据新华社讯）
