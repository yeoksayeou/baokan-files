Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The national autumn harvest is now only a little over a month away. This year, only a few areas across the country have suffered relatively severe droughts and floods; the vast majority of areas can expect a bumper harvest.

The Ministry of Agriculture issued instructions at the end of August, requiring all localities to prepare for the autumn harvest and lead farmers to strive for bumper yields. Areas that have already achieved bumper summer harvests should strive for continued bumper harvests in the autumn; areas that estimate they can complete their annual production plans should strive to overfulfill their plans; areas that have difficulty completing their plans should resolutely overcome difficulties, seize time to find ways to make up for it, and strive to complete their plans.

The instructions require all localities to focus on the following tasks: 1. Areas with natural disasters must lead farmers to overcome them in a timely manner. Currently, provinces in the north should strengthen flood control and drainage work. If waterlogging occurs, immediately drain the water to save the crops, and apply fertilizer and weed to strive for preservation or increased production. Those that cannot be salvaged should actively help farmers plant short-term crops or vegetables. Provinces in the south and high-altitude fields in mountainous areas should continue to pay attention to drought prevention and resistance. Coastal areas should be vigilant against typhoon attacks. All localities must continue to prevent and control insect pests, and must not relax in the slightest. 2. Strengthen field management in the later stages of autumn crops. In the south, vigorously mobilize farmers to apply topdressing fertilizer to rice in a timely and appropriate amount, irrigate rationally, and prevent lodging. In miscellaneous grain areas, the main tasks should be cultivating, weeding, soil cultivation, and topdressing. In cotton-growing areas, do a good job of pruning and pest control in the later stages. In areas with excessive autumn rains, in particular, do a good job of drainage, cultivation, and prevent excessive growth and late maturity. 3. Before the harvest, universally call on farmers to harvest and thresh carefully, striving to bring every grain home. When harvesting cotton, ensure careful and clean picking, and change the habit of picking green bolls. Educate farmers on the benefits of careful harvesting and threshing, and careful and clean picking, emphasizing the accumulation of small amounts into large amounts and the benefits to themselves and the country through accounting methods; and mobilize farmers to prepare for harvesting as early as possible.

    农业部指示各地作好秋收准备力争丰产丰收
    新华社六日讯　现在距离全国秋收只有一个多月了。今年全国只有少数地区受旱受涝较重，绝大部分地区都可丰收。
    农业部已在八月底发出指示，要求各地作好秋收准备工作，并领导农民力争丰产丰收。夏季已获丰收的地区应争取秋季连续丰收；估计可以完成全年生产计划的地区应力争超额完成计划；完成计划有困难的地区应坚决克服困难，争取时间设法弥补，力争完成计划。
    指示要求各地着重做好以下工作：一、有自然灾害的地区须领导农民及时战胜自然灾害。目前北方各省应加强防汛防涝工作。有了内涝立刻排水救禾，并追肥除草，争取保收或增产。已无法挽救者应积极帮助农民栽种短期作物或蔬菜。南方各省及山区高田应继续注意防旱抗旱。沿海地区应警惕台风的侵袭。各地都须继续防治虫害，决不能有所放松。二、加强秋季作物后期的田间管理。南方应大力发动农民为水稻适期适量增施追肥，合理灌溉，防止倒伏。杂粮地区主要应进行中耕除草、培土、追肥。棉区应作好后期整枝治虫工作，秋雨过多的地区尤应作好排水、中耕并防止疯长晚熟。三、在收获前，普遍号召农民细收细打，争取颗粒还家。收获棉花做到细收净摘，并改变摘青铃的习惯。用算账办法教育农民细收细打，细收净摘，宣传积少成多，对自己对国家的好处；并发动农民及早准备收割。
