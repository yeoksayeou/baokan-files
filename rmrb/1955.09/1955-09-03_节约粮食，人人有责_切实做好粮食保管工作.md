    Conserving Grain is Everyone's Responsibility, Conscientiously Do a Good Job of Grain Storage
    According to readers' letters, the grain depot storage work in some places is not being done well, and the phenomenon of grain mildewing and rotting is very serious. According to an inspection by the Jilin Provincial Grain Bureau, from the time the new grain was put into storage last year until May of this year, more than 30 incidents of mildewed and rotten grain were discovered throughout the province, resulting in a loss of more than 120,000 jin of grain. The 750 tons of soybeans stored in the Ganjingzi Grain Depot in Dalian were always considered to be problem-free by the director of the grain depot until they were inspected in April of this year, when it was discovered that they had all turned gray due to mildew. According to a letter from the Supervision Office of the Hubei Provincial Grain Bureau, the 150,000 jin of soybeans stored by the Yunmeng County Grain Bureau in the Chengguan local state-owned oil extraction factory were known to be "dangerous grain" with high moisture content and high grain temperature, but they were stored in a leaky and damp factory building for a long time without sorting or turning over, and as a result, almost all of the soybeans were moldy and rotten.
    In some other grain depots, grain is being lost in large quantities due to theft by rats, feeding by sparrows, and insect infestation. For example, Jiang Deling from Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, wrote that more than 11,000 jin of grain were dug out of rat holes in the grain depots of five districts in Deping County; this grain had already rotted into powder. Reader Li Yuning from Xikang Province reported that when he went to the Xingxiang Grain Depot in the third district of Miyi County in June to collect grain, he found that the warehouse was full of flying and crawling moths, and the grain was damp and infested with insects. Readers Zhao Yuan and Yang Guang reported that the windows at the back of the grain warehouse on a farm in Qujing Prefecture, Yunnan Province, were often open, thus becoming a "convenient canteen" for sparrows; and the area around the warehouse was the domain of rats.
    In addition, incidents of grain being stolen by bad elements or destroyed by fire often occur in some grain depots. Reader Jiang Deling reported that from May to early June of this year, nine theft cases occurred in Lin邑 (Yì), Deping, Jiyang, and Pingyuan counties under the jurisdiction of Dezhou Prefecture, with more than 1,200 jin of grain being stolen. For example, in Hunan Province, since the autumn grain was put into storage last year, there have been 60 cases of theft, fire, and other destructive incidents in seven counties, resulting in a total loss of more than 14,600 jin of rice. According to an investigation by the Ministry of Food, the number of grains lost due to theft and fire in the first quarter of this year has increased significantly compared to the same period last year.
    The above-mentioned situation of mildewing and loss of grain is distressing. But it is worth noting that some of the personnel responsible for grain storage still have the view that the current warehouse conditions are simple and the grain storage task is very heavy, so mildewing and loss of grain are difficult to avoid. This view is incorrect. In fact, many model grain depots have emerged in various places. Although these grain depots have very simple conditions and a large task, they have made outstanding achievements due to the active efforts of the staff. We can also cite the situation reflected in the letters from readers Gao Chongyang and Shang Xiangxing to illustrate this problem: The People's Committee of Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, recently conducted an inspection of 45 grassroots grain storage units and found that a large amount of grain in many grain depots had mildewed and spoiled; however, there were also 11 storage units that, although the storage conditions were very poor, because the staff was diligent and responsible, the sanitation work was done well, and the storage of various grains was in good order, they had not suffered any losses for a long time. It can be seen that under the same storage conditions, completely different results can be achieved in grain storage work.
    Doing a good job of storing grain is an important part of conserving grain. This work is arduous, but it is also extremely glorious. Grain departments and storage personnel at all levels should actively work hard, use their brains, overcome various objective difficulties, and ensure that grain, this "treasure among treasures," does not suffer any undue losses.

### 节约粮食，人人有责  切实做好粮食保管工作

    节约粮食，人人有责
    切实做好粮食保管工作
    根据读者来信反映，某些地方的粮库保管工作做得不好，粮食霉烂的现象很严重。据吉林省粮食厅检查，从去年新粮入库到今年五月，全省共发现霉烂粮食事故三十多起，损失粮食十二万多斤。旅大市甘井子粮库储存的七百五十吨大豆，粮库主任一直认为没有问题，直到今年四月检查的时候，才发现都已经因霉烂而变成了灰色。另据湖北省粮食厅监察室来信，云梦县粮食局保管在城关地方国营榨油厂的十五万斤黄豆，原来知道是水分大、粮温高的“危粮”，但是却一直存放在一所上漏下湿的厂房里，长期不整理、不翻晒，结果几乎全部黄豆都霉烂了。
    在还有一些粮库里，粮食因为被鼠盗、雀食和虫蚀而大量损耗。如山东德州专署姜德龄来信反映：在德平县五个区的粮仓中，从老鼠洞里扒出的粮食有一万一千多斤；这些粮食都已经烂成了粉末。西康省读者李玉宁反映，他在六月间到米易县三区兴乡粮库领粮食时，发现这个仓库满仓都是飞着爬着的蛾子，粮食也都潮湿生虫了。读者赵源、杨光反映，云南曲靖专区农场的粮食仓库后面的窗子经常开着，因此就成了麻雀的“如意食堂”了；而仓库的四周则是老鼠的天下。
    另外，粮食被坏分子乘机盗窃或者被火烧毁的事件，在一部分粮库也经常发生。读者姜德龄反映，德州专署所属临邑、德平、济阳、平原四个县从今年五月到六月上旬，就发生了偷盗案九起，被盗粮食一千二百多斤。又如，湖南省有七个县自去年秋征粮入库以来就发生了偷盗、失火和其他破坏事故六十起，共计损失稻谷一万四千六百多斤。据粮食部调查，今年第一季度发生盗窃和失火而损失的粮食数字，比去年同时期有了显著的增加。
    以上霉烂和损耗粮食的情况是令人痛心的。但值得注意的是：有一部分负责粮食保管工作的人员还有这样一种看法，他们认为：目前仓库条件简陋，储粮任务很大，因此霉烂和损耗粮食是很难避免的。这种看法是不正确的。事实上，目前各地已经出现了不少模范粮库。这些粮库虽然条件很简陋，任务也很大；但是由于工作人员积极努力，因而作出了优异的成绩。还可以举出读者高崇阳、商祥兴来信反映的情况来说明这个问题：黑龙江拜泉县人民委员会最近对四十五个基层储粮单位进行了检查，发现很多粮仓有大批粮食霉坏了；但是也有十一个仓储单位，虽然仓储条件很差，因为工作人员勤劳负责，卫生工作搞得好，各种粮食保管得有条不紊，长期以来没有遭到任何损失。由此可见，在同样的仓储条件下，粮食保管工作是可以取得完全不同的结果的。
    做好保管粮食的工作，是节约粮食工作中重要的一环。这项工作是艰巨的，但也是极其光荣的。各级粮食部门和保管工作人员应该积极努力，开动脑筋，克服各种客观困难，使粮食这个“宝中之宝”不受到任何不应有的损失。
