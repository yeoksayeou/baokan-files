The National Grease Industry Workers will comprehensively launch a production increase and frugality labor emulation campaign before the end of this year, to over fulfill the annual task of increasing vegetable oil production by 100,000 tons.

The Second National Grease Professional Conference, held in Beijing from August 20th to September 1st, has determined that the focus of the production increase and frugality emulation campaign in the grease industry in the second half of the year should be to strengthen ideological and organizational leadership, strengthen the management of indigenous oil presses, continue to vigorously promote advanced oil extraction experience, open up new oil sources, implement processing agreements, strengthen enterprise management, oppose waste, and practice strict economy.

According to the reports from the representatives of various provinces and cities attending the conference, the national grease industry has increased vegetable oil production by more than 50,100 tons in the first half of this year, completing more than half of the annual production increase plan, and many units have overfulfilled their tasks. However, the conference believes that we should see that there are still many shortcomings in the current grease production increase work, such as the lack of sufficient understanding of the great significance of increasing grease production by relevant departments in some areas, and thus showing fear of difficulties in their work; the organizational structures for grease production increase work in some provinces and cities are not yet sound, and the vast number of indigenous oil presses have not been well managed; some units have departmentalism ideology, and thus cooperation between departments is not good enough. These shortcomings have hindered the further in-depth development of grease production increase work to a certain extent. Many enterprises have serious waste in the transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, and in the production process, due to poor management; some enterprises also have increased raw material consumption due to neglecting cost management. The conference believes that these shortcomings must be corrected.

The conference also believes that it was right to focus on mechanized and semi-mechanized oil mills in the first half of the year's grease production increase work; however, indigenous oil presses account for a large proportion of the country, and the task of increasing production from indigenous oil presses in the second half of the year accounts for about half of the total production increase task. If the indigenous oil presses are not organized and managed in time, it will be difficult to complete the production increase task in the second half of the year. Therefore, on the basis of consolidating the existing production increase achievements of mechanized and semi-mechanized oil mills, in the second half of the year, according to the principle of "who processes is responsible for management," we should learn from the experience of some regions such as Shanxi, Anhui, and Sichuan, and divide responsibilities to truly organize and manage the indigenous oil presses.

During the conference, a new oil source exhibition room was also held, exhibiting 66 new varieties of oilseeds and 55 new oil products. The exhibition room provided detailed introductions to the oil content, oil yield, properties, and uses of each new oilseed, providing important information for further opening up new oil sources.

This National Grease Professional Conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Local Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, the Central Handicraft Administration Bureau, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and the Light Industry Workers' Union Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. More than 200 representatives from relevant units in various provinces and cities attended the conference. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 全国油脂专业会议确定下半年油脂增产任务

    全国油脂专业会议确定下半年油脂增产任务
    全国油脂工业职工将在今年年底以前全面展开增产节约劳动竞赛，以超额完成全年增产十万吨植物油的任务。
    八月二十日到九月一日在北京举行的全国第二次油脂专业会议已经确定：下半年油脂工业的增产节约竞赛的中心，应该是加强思想领导和组织领导，加强对土榨油坊的管理，继续大力推广先进的榨油经验，开辟新油源，贯彻加工协议，加强企业管理，反对浪费和厉行节约。
    根据到会的各省、市代表的汇报，今年上半年全国油脂工业已增产五万零一百多吨植物油，完成全年增产计划一半以上，不少单位并超额完成了任务。但是这次会议认为，应该看到目前油脂增产工作中还存在着很多缺点，如部分地区有关部门对增产油脂的重大意义认识不足，因而在工作中表现畏难情绪；部分省、市的油脂增产工作的组织机构还不健全，对广大的土榨油坊还没有很好地管理起来；有些单位存在着本位主义思想，因而部门之间协作得不够好。这些缺点都在一定程度上妨碍了油脂增产工作的进一步深入展开。有很多企业由于管理不善，在原料、成品的运输和保管中，在生产过程中，浪费现象还是很严重的；部分企业并存在着因忽视成本管理而产生的原材料消耗量增多的现象。会议认为这些缺点都必须加以纠正。
    会议还认为，上半年油脂增产工作的重点放在机榨和半机榨的油厂上是对的；但全国土榨油坊占很大比重，下半年土榨油坊的增产任务约占总增产任务的一半左右，如果不及时地将土榨油坊组织和管理起来，下半年的增产任务是难以完成的。因此，在巩固机榨和半机榨油厂已有增产成绩的基础上，下半年应按“谁加工谁负责管理”的原则，吸取山西、安徽、四川等一些地区的经验，分工负责地把土榨油坊真正地组织和管理起来。
    在这次会议期间，还举办了新油源展览室，展出了六十六种新品种油料和五十五种新油品。展览室详尽地介绍了每种新油料的含油率、出油率、油品的性质和用途等，为进一步开辟新油源提供了重要资料。
    这次全国油脂专业会议是由地方工业部、轻工业部、商业部、粮食部、中央手工业管理局、全国供销合作总社和中华全国总工会轻工业工会工作委员会等单位联合召开的，参加会议的有各省、市有关单位的代表二百多人。　（新华社）
