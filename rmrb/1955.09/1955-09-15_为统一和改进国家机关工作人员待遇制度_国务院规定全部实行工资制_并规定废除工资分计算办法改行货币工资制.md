Xinhua News Agency, 14th. In order to unify and improve the living treatment system for staff members of state organs, the State Council issued the "Order on the Full Implementation of the Wage System and the Change to a Monetary Wage System for Staff Members of State Organs" on August 31.

The order stipulates: In order to implement the principles of "to each according to their work" and "equal pay for equal work," starting from July 1955, the existing contracted treatment system practiced by some staff members in state organs will be uniformly changed to a wage system, to unify the treatment system for staff members of state organs and facilitate the advancement of the socialist construction cause.

The order stipulates: After the full implementation of the wage system, all living expenses of staff members and their families shall be borne by the individuals themselves. The current provisions for contracted fees, preferential treatment for the elderly, family hospitality fees, dietary subsidies for the sick, home travel expenses, women's hygiene fees, maternity fees, childcare fees, nanny fees, children's medical expenses, publicly funded student treatment, subsidies for the upbringing of children of staff members with a one-supply-one-salary system (i.e., one party on the supply system, one party on the wage system), and regulations regarding school fees and boarding fees for staff members' children in administrative expense standards are all abolished from July 1955.

The order stipulates: After the full implementation of the wage system, staff members shall pay rent and fees for public housing, public furniture, water, electricity, and sending children to nurseries. The State Council has formulated measures for rent and fee collection and dormitory heating subsidies for central state organs, which are issued with the order; and it is the responsibility of the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government to formulate various rent and fee collection measures with reference to the measures of the central state organs, combined with the specific conditions of the local area, and issue them for implementation in their respective jurisdictions.

The order stipulates: Starting from July 1955, the wage point calculation method will be abolished in state organs and affiliated institutions, and a monetary wage system will be implemented. The salary standard table for staff members of state organs will be revised to a monetary salary standard table; at the same time, in order to resolve the price differences between regions, a price subsidy table will be formulated and issued together.

The order stipulates: In order to comply with the principle of "equal pay for equal work," starting from November 1955, the "reserved wage" (i.e., some staff members retained their original higher wage standards after transferring jobs) for some staff members will be abolished. The order also stipulates that for some people who have genuine difficulties in their lives due to the abolition of the reserved wage, or for some people who have genuine difficulties in their lives due to having many children after changing from the supply system to the wage system, subsidies may be provided from the organ's welfare fund.

Simultaneously with the issuance of the "Order on the Full Implementation of the Wage System and the Change to a Monetary Wage System for Staff Members of State Organs," in order to ensure the living needs of staff members in some areas with inconvenient transportation and a lack of supplies, the "Decision on Implementing In-Kind Supply for Staff Members in Certain Special Areas" was also issued, and implemented from October 1955.

    为统一和改进国家机关工作人员待遇制度
    国务院规定全部实行工资制
    并规定废除工资分计算办法改行货币工资制
    新华社十四日讯　为了统一和改进国家机关工作人员的生活待遇制度，国务院于八月三十一日发布“关于国家机关工作人员全部实行工资制和改行货币工资制的命令”。
    命令规定：为了实行“按劳取酬”和“同工同酬”的原则，自一九五五年七月份起，将现在国家机关一部分工作人员中实行的包干制待遇，一律改为工资制待遇，以统一国家机关工作人员的待遇制度，并有利于推进建设社会主义的事业。
    命令规定：全部实行工资制待遇后，工作人员个人及其家属的一切生活费用，都应由个人负担。现行的包干费、老年优待费、家属招待费、病员伙食补贴、回家旅费、妇女卫生费、生育费、保育费、保姆费、儿童医药费、公费生待遇、一供一薪（即一方供给制待遇，一方工资制待遇）的工作人员子女教养补助费以及行政经费开支标准中有关工作人员子女入学学杂费和宿费等项规定，都从一九五五年七月份起废除。
    命令规定：全部实行工资制待遇后，凡工作人员住用公家房屋、使用公家家具、用水用电、子女送托儿所等，应一律缴租、纳费。国务院已制定中央国家机关的各项收租、收费办法和宿舍取暖补贴办法，随命令发布；并责成各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会参照中央国家机关的办法，结合当地具体情况，分别制定各项收租、收费办法，在各该辖区发布施行。
  　命令规定：自一九五五年七月份起，在国家机关及所属事业单位废除工资分计算办法，改行货币工资制，将国家机关工作人员的工资标准表修订为货币工资标准表；同时，为了解决各地区之间存在的物价差额，制定物价津贴表，一并发布。
    命令规定：为了符合“同工同酬”的原则，自一九五五年十一月份起，取消部分工作人员的“保留工资”（即有些工作人员调动工作后，保留了原来的较高的工资标准）。命令还规定：有些人因取消保留工资，生活上确有困难的，或者有些人由供给制待遇改为工资制待遇后，因多子女而生活上确有困难的，可用机关福利费予以补助。
    与发布“关于国家机关工作人员全部实行工资制和改行货币工资制的命令”的同时，为了保证某些交通不便、物资缺乏地区工作人员的生活需要，还发布了“关于某些特殊地区工作人员实行实物供应的决定”，自一九五五年十月份起实行。
