Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch, Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party Central Secretariat Secretaries Shida Shigeo and Miyamoto Kenji stated when meeting with reporters in Osaka on the 5th that the Japanese Communist Party will fight against every activity that attempts to outlaw the Communist Party.

Shida and Miyamoto pointed out that recent attempts to outlaw the Communist Party are very prominent. They mentioned that Democratic Party Secretary-General Nobusuke Kishi recently revealed in the United States the news that he wanted to outlaw the Japanese Communist Party, saying that domestic problems in Japan must also be discussed with the United States, which is enough to clearly explain the nature of the Democratic Party cabinet. They also exposed another plan by the Hatoyama cabinet to suppress the Communist Party—the plan to establish the so-called "Public Security Countermeasures Council." According to Justice Minister Shiro Hanamura on the 4th, Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama has approved the establishment of this agency.

In their conversation, Shida and Miyamoto pointed out that according to the current Japanese Constitution, it is not possible to outlaw the Japanese Communist Party. They also emphasized that if the Hatoyama government wants to act recklessly, it will be isolated among the people.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch, Tokyo: Hiroo Wada and Inajiro Asanuma, Secretaries-General of the Japanese Socialist Parties (Left and Right), held talks on the morning of the 5th to discuss the two parties' attitude towards the joint communiqué of the Japan-U.S. talks. As a result of the talks, the two parties decided to submit a motion of no confidence against Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu during the extraordinary session of the Diet. This is because Shigemitsu, in the Japan-U.S. talks, unilaterally assured the United States that Japan would amend its constitution to accelerate rearmament and assume the obligation to send troops abroad. The two parties also decided that after Shigemitsu returns to Japan, they would first request immediate meetings of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Councillors and the Joint Committee of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives to investigate the diplomatic policy of the Hatoyama government.

The joint statement issued by the two parties condemned Shigemitsu's assurance to the United States, saying that Shigemitsu's assurance ignored the constitution, violated the House of Councillors' resolution against sending troops abroad, and trampled on democratic secret diplomacy, and was a "retrograde expression of siding with the United States in defiance of the general trend of the world."

The two parties also criticized the Hatoyama cabinet's attitude towards promoting the normalization of relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union. The statement said: "The promise made by the Hatoyama cabinet to adjust diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China on Japan's independent position has been trampled on."

The two parties also expressed their intention to submit a motion of no confidence against the Director General of the "Defense Agency," Shigemasa Sunada. This is because Shigemasa Sunada has recently made a series of irresponsible remarks, implying that he would recruit high school graduates to form a reserve force for the "Self-Defense Forces."

    日共中央书记志田重男和宫本显治
    谴责鸠山政府企图使日共非法化的活动
    日本两派社会党决定就日美谈判问题对重光提出不信任案
    新华社六日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央书记局书记志田重男和宫本显治五日在大阪接见记者时表示，日本共产党将对每一个企图使共产党非法的活动进行斗争。
    志田和宫本指出，最近企图使共产党成为非法的活动甚为显著。他们谈到民主党干事长岸信介最近在美国透露要使日本共产党非法化的消息说，日本国内的问题也必须同美国磋商，这足以明白地说明民主党内阁的性质。他们也揭发了鸠山内阁的另一项镇压共产党的计划——设置所谓“治安对策协议会”的计划。据法务相花村四郎四日说，首相鸠山一郎已经批准成立这个机构。
    志田和宫本在谈话中指出，根据日本现行宪法，是不能够使日本共产党成为非法的。他们并且强调说，如果鸠山政府要蛮干，它就将在人民中孤立。
    新华社五日讯　东京消息：日本左、右两派社会党总书记和田博雄和浅沼稻次郎五日上午举行会谈，协商两党对日美会谈联合公报的态度。会谈结果，两党决定要在国会召开临时会议期间，对外务相重光葵提出不信任案。因为重光在日美会谈中擅自向美国保证日本要修改宪法以加速重整军备和承担向国外派兵的义务。两党并且决定在重光葵回国后首先要求立刻举行参议院外务委员会和众议院外务委员会协议会会议，对鸠山政府的外交政策进行查究。
    两党发表的联合声明谴责重光葵向美国作的保证说：重光葵的保证是忽视宪法，违反参议院关于反对向国外派兵的决议和蹂躏民主的秘密外交，是“违背世界大势倒行逆施的向美国一边倒的表现”。
    两党在声明中还抨击鸠山内阁对促使日中、日苏关系正常化所抱的态度。声明说：“鸠山内阁提出的站在日本自主的立场上调整日苏、日中邦交的诺言已经受到践踏”。
    两党还表示要对“防卫厅”长官砂田重政提出不信任案。因为砂田重政最近不断发表不负责任的言论，暗示要征募高等学校毕业生，组成“自卫队”的预备队。
