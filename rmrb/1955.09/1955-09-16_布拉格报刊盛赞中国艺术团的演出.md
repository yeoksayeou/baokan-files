    During its stay in Prague, the Chinese Art Troupe gave five public performances starting on August 24. The performances of the Chinese Art Troupe in Prague became a major event in Prague's cultural life. Newspapers published many reviews and photos introducing the performances of the Chinese Art Troupe, praising the Chinese dramatic art and the superb acting skills of the actors.

    "Red Right" newspaper published an article by the famous Czech Sinologist, Professor Prusek, saying: The performance of the Chinese Art Troupe is indeed a festival for all drama lovers and all true art lovers. "The program performed by the Chinese Art Troupe is the peak of the continuously developing Chinese national drama."

    The "Freedom" magazine, published on September 2, commented: Anyone who has seen the performance of the actors of the Chinese Art Troupe will be fascinated. The art of our Chinese friends is indeed a unique enjoyment for us. The performance of the Chinese Art Troupe allows us to directly glimpse the hearts of the Chinese people who are full of diligence, wit, and talent, who love freedom, and oppose oppression and tyranny. It is not surprising that the Chinese Art Troupe has achieved unprecedented success in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands over the years. We are glad that this kind of people and this kind of culture are standing on our side.

    Newspaper reviews are particularly interested in the acting skills of Peking Opera actors.

    Professor Prusek said in an article published in "Red Right": "Chinese actors skillfully used the elements of classical pantomime and ballet, and very naturally used gestures to express all the complex phenomena in the world. This excellent ability to accurately and vividly, and extremely artistically express anything is the most powerful weapon of Chinese classical drama and its actors."

    Kostiář, the first deputy head of the Czechoslovak National Song and Dance Troupe who had visited China, wrote in the "Prague Evening News": The performance on August 24 once again proved that it is indeed not easy to be an actor in China. All actors master many acrobatic arts, while in Czechoslovakia, only outstanding acrobats can master them. At the same time, the performance should include the elements of dance and pantomime, with varying degrees of subtle and humorous plots. All of this is constantly changing at a very fast pace. People are surprised how they can remember so many changes, and many actors must also be able to sing at the same time.

    The article titled "Precious Art" published in the "Literary Newspaper" on September 3, talked about "Sancha Kou", "one of the most beautiful and moving scenes" performed by the art troupe, saying: Excellent actors Zhang Yunxi and Zhang Chunhua performed "Sancha Kou", not only perfectly mastering the difficult dances and movements of the characters, but also giving these dances and movements a rich national color. Their superb acting skills enabled them to successfully handle the most difficult scenes on the stage—the gaps in extreme tension and the scenes of warriors falling asleep.

    "Freedom" magazine believes that "Sancha Kou" is the best example of the cooperation of Chinese classical drama artists. It expressed regret that "Sancha Kou" was only performed once, and many other audiences could not see it.

    The newspapers also believed that "Autumn River" was one of the most successful programs performed by the Chinese Art Troupe. "Freedom" magazine said: "Autumn River" can only be performed by actors who have a deep observation of life and are diligent in their artistic work. "Literary Newspaper" said: Zhang Chunhua, who played the shopkeeper in "Sancha Kou", also played the ferryman in "Autumn River", which confused the audience. This is a very well-performed role. "People's Democracy Newspaper" said: We immediately loved this happy ferryman - none of us could understand or even predict that this role was excellently performed by a twenty-six-year-old young actor.

    The newspapers also highly praised the collective martial arts and dance skills in "Yandang Mountain" and the sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine."

    The newspaper articles were also very interested in the Peking Opera's bright facial makeup, gorgeous costumes, and moving music.

    In addition, the "Lotus Dance" performed by the art troupe and the ensemble of folk instruments guzheng and erhu were also warmly praised.

### 布拉格报刊盛赞中国艺术团的演出

    布拉格报刊盛赞中国艺术团的演出
    中国艺术团在布拉格期间，从八月二十四日起作了五场公演。中国艺术团在布拉格的演出成了布拉格文化生活中的一件大事。报刊登载了许多评论文章和照片评介中国艺术团的演出，它们对中国的戏剧艺术和演员的精湛演技倍加赞扬。
    “红色权利报”发表捷克斯洛伐克著名汉学家普实克的文章说：中国艺术团的演出的确是一切戏剧爱好者和一切真正艺术爱好者的节日。“中国艺术团所演出的节目是不断发展着的中国民族戏剧的高峰”。
    九月二日出版的“自由”杂志评论说：凡是看过中国艺术团演员表演的人都会被迷住的。我们中国朋友的艺术对我们来说的确是独特的享受。中国艺术团的演出使我们能够直接窥见充满勤劳、机智和才能，热爱自由，反对压迫和反对强权的中国人民的心灵。中国艺术团在法国、比利时、荷兰获得当地多年来从未见过的巨大成功是不足惊奇的。我们为这种人和这种文化是和我们站在一边而感到高兴。
    报纸上的评论对京剧演员的演技特别感到兴趣。
    普实克在“红色权利报”上发表的文章中说：“中国演员们天才地运用了古典哑剧和巴蕾舞的因素，非常自然地用手势表达出世界上一切复杂的现象。这种准确而形象地，极其艺术地表现任何事物的卓越才能，就是中国古典戏剧及其演员的最有力的武器”。
    曾经访问过中国的捷克斯洛伐克国家歌舞团第一副团长科什蒂亚尔在“布拉格晚报”上著文说：八月二十四日的演出又一次证明了，在中国作一个演员的确是不容易的，所有演员都掌握许多杂技艺术，而在捷克斯洛伐克只有出色的杂技演员才能掌握。同时在表演中要演出舞蹈和哑剧的因素，有着不同程度的细致入微的和幽默的情节。这一切又都以很快的速度不断地变化着。人们惊奇他们怎能记得住这样多的变化，而且很多演员同时还要能唱。
    九月三日“文学报”刊载的题为“珍贵的艺术”的文章中谈到艺术团演出的“许多最美丽和动人心弦的场面之一”的“三岔口”时说：优秀演员张云溪和张春华表演“三岔口”，不仅完美地掌握了角色困难的舞蹈和动作，并且赋予这些舞蹈和动作以丰富的民族色彩，纯熟的演技使他们成功地处理了舞台上最难处理的场面——极度紧张中的空隙和壮士入睡的场面。
    “自由”杂志认为“三岔口”是中国古典戏剧艺术家们合作的最好范例。并对“三岔口”只演了一场，其他许多观众不能看到，表示遗憾。
    报纸还都认为“秋江”是中国艺术团演出获得最大成功的节目之一。“自由”杂志说：“秋江”只有在深刻观察生活和勤奋地从事艺术劳动的演员才能表演出来。“文学报”说：在“三岔口”里饰店主的张春华还演了使观众迷惑的“秋江”中的艄公。这是一个演得极好的角色。“人民民主报”说：我们立刻喜爱这个愉快的艄公——我们中间没有人能理解，甚至预测这个角色是由二十六岁的年青演员杰出地表演的。
    报纸对“雁荡山”中的集体武技和舞技，对“霸王别姬”中的剑舞也给予很高评价。
    报纸的文章中还对京剧的鲜明的脸谱、华丽的服装和感人的音乐很感兴趣。
    此外，艺术团演出的“荷花舞”和民间乐器古筝二胡合奏也受到了热烈赞赏。　（新华社）
