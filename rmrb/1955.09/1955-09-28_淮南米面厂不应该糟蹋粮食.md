    Huainan Rice and Flour Mill Should Not Waste Grain
    To the Editor:
    The phenomenon of wasting grain at the Huainan Rice and Flour Mill is very serious. In May of this year, during the factory's machine repair shutdown, we inspected their warehouse and found more than twenty bags of unprocessed wheat remaining. Among them, fifteen bags were placed against the wall and had already deteriorated due to dampness. More than 150 jin had been eaten hollow by insects. The warehouse floor was covered with moldy and rotten grain. Some of the wheat had sprouted and grown to six or seven inches long. We cleaned a small warehouse and swept out 22 jin of moldy grain and 18 jin of sprouted wheat. The wheat ash dumped outside by the factory after processing still contained many wheat grains, and the sprouted wheat grew green everywhere. On August 17th, we inspected the factory again and found that the waste wheat and ash wheat screened out during processing amounted to more than 1,500 jin, containing approximately 700 jin of wheat. They did not promptly dispose of these materials but allowed them to rot.
    In addition, in June of this year, our bureau received 7,770 empty hemp bags returned by the Huainan Rice and Flour Mill after processing, of which 951 had been cut open with knives. Although we repeatedly raised objections, many of the hemp bags they returned afterward were still cut open with knives.

    淮南米面厂不应该糟蹋粮食编辑同志：
    淮南米面厂糟蹋粮食的现象很严重。今年五月，这个工厂停机修理期间，我们检查了他们的仓库，发现剩有未加工完的小麦二十多包，其中有十五包放在靠墙的地方，已经受湿变质；有一百五十多斤已经被虫子吃空。仓库里满地都是霉烂的粮食，有的小麦生芽已经长达六七寸。我们打扫了一小间仓库，就扫出霉烂的粮食二十二斤，生芽的小麦十八斤。这个工厂加工后倒在外边的麦灰，中间还含有很多麦粒，麦芽长的遍地发绿。八月十七日，我们又检查了这个工厂，发现加工筛下来的下脚麦和灰土麦多达一千五百多斤，里面含有小麦约七百多斤。他们对这些物资也不及时进行处理，而是让它烂掉了事。
    此外，今年六月，我局收到淮南米面厂的七千七百七十条加工回交的空麻袋，其中有九百五十一条被他们用小刀割破了。虽然我们一再提出意见，但是以后他们交回来的麻袋中，还有许多是用刀割破的。
