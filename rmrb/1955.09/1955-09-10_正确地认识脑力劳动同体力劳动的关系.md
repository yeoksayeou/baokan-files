    Correctly Understanding the Relationship Between Mental and Physical Labor
    Zhou Yuanbing
    Currently, in the work of educating young people, many still hold the erroneous view of looking down on physical labor and physical laborers. Some students' parents are unwilling for their children to engage in physical labor, and even some teachers are consciously or unconsciously spreading views that belittle physical labor among students. On the other hand, in some areas, in the process of conducting labor education, there has been a one-sided emphasis on the importance of physical labor, reducing or even negating the role of mental labor, mistakenly regarding physical labor as the only form of labor, believing that only participation in direct productive labor is glorious, and even adopting the erroneous practice of ridiculing and satirizing young people who hope to pursue further education.
    To fundamentally overcome these two erroneous views, it is necessary to scientifically understand the relationship between mental and physical labor.
    Humans evolved from anthropoid apes. Labor played a decisive role in the transformation from ape to human. Due to labor, the forelimbs of anthropoid apes became human hands. Therefore, Engels said: "The hand is not only the organ of labor, it is also the product of labor." ("Dialectics of Nature") When the hand was freed from the function of the foot, human ancestors gradually learned to walk upright, and with the development of labor, situations of mutual assistance and common activities also increased, which led to the emergence and development of articulate speech. Labor and articulate speech had a decisive influence on the development of the human brain. In the process of labor, the scope of human perception and concepts expanded, and the sensory organs also became more perfect. Therefore, the difference between humans and other animals lies not only in the fact that humans can manufacture tools, but also in the fact that human labor is conscious.
    From the origin and nature of human labor, it is explained that the human mind and human mental labor are formed and developed in the process of human physical labor. All material means of life for mankind are directly produced by physical labor. Without physical labor and physical laborers, it would be impossible for people to obtain these material means of life, and neither scientists, writers, nor engineers could engage in mental labor. All scientific knowledge is summarized from the experience accumulated by the laboring people in their long-term labor practice. Without physical labor, mental laborers can neither create anything nor turn their ideas into reality. Failing to see the dependence of mental labor on physical labor and one-sidedly exaggerating the role of mental labor is a kind of idealist argument.
    However, this does not mean negating or diminishing the role of mental labor. On the contrary, the beginning of mental labor by mankind is not only of great significance in making humans break away from the animal world, but also plays a very important role in promoting the development of human society and improving physical labor.
    The production of various material resources on which human beings depend for survival is not merely a kind of physical labor, but also includes human mental activity. Marx said: "In the construction of a beehive, the ability of bees has made many people in the business of architects ashamed. But what makes the worst architect superior to the most ingenious bee is that the architect has constructed it in his brain before building the beehive with beeswax." ("Capital," Volume 1) Mental labor is an indispensable part of human labor. Although physical labor is the premise for the generation and conduct of mental labor, mental labor can promote the improvement and development of physical labor. Therefore, it is idealist to one-sidedly exaggerate the role of mental labor, but it is also wrong to one-sidedly deny or incorrectly estimate the role of mental labor.
    In the early stages of human history, because there was no private property, no classes, and no exploitation, all members of society were equal; because labor tools were very simple and the production process was not complex, there was no and could not be a division between mental and physical labor. However, when social productive forces developed to a level where some surplus products could be obtained in addition to the necessary consumption of the producers themselves, private ownership of the means of production was produced, and the phenomenon of classes and human exploitation of humans appeared, thus beginning the division between mental and physical labor.
    The formation of the class system enabled the exploited laboring masses to only engage in exhausting physical labor; and the right to enjoy education and engage in mental activities was monopolized by those exploiters and their intellectuals. Moreover, as the exploitation of the minority over the majority deepened, the social division of labor between mental and physical labor became increasingly deepened and fixed.
    Since physical laborers are in a position of being exploited and ruled, and do not have the right to enjoy education and engage in mental labor, and since these rights are monopolized by the exploiting classes and their intellectuals, and at the same time the exploiting classes use the mental labor of their intellectuals to exploit physical laborers, mental laborers are in a position of opposition to physical laborers. Therefore, Stalin said: "The economic basis for the opposition between mental and physical labor is the exploitation of physical laborers by mental laborers." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR")
    In capitalist society, especially in the era of imperialism, the opposition between mental and physical labor reached the point of intensification. This is because under the capitalist system, human labor has also become a commodity. When capitalists purchase the labor of laborers, they strive for low prices, and when they exploit them, they try to extract the maximum profit. In order to facilitate the rule and management of workers, capitalists, on the one hand, deprive workers of the opportunity to receive education by means of heavy labor, and on the other hand, separate mental labor such as scientific research and business management from physical labor. The mental labor of intellectuals is also purchased by capitalists as a commodity to oppress and exploit workers and expand their profits. This makes intellectuals, although not in the same position as capitalists, in fact become tools to help the bourgeoisie oppress and exploit workers. This is also because under the capitalist system, technological progress and machine improvements do not mean the reduction of workers' labor, but the increase of workers' labor intensity and the increase of surplus value. Workers can only do some of the most monotonous and easy-to-learn movements with the rotation of the machine. Heavy labor consumes all the energy of the workers, and the achievements of mental labor are mostly stolen by the capitalists and used to aggravate the exploitation of physical laborers. Thus, the opposition between mental labor and physical labor becomes increasingly acute.
    It can be seen that the opposition between mental and physical labor is a historical phenomenon. However, the exploiting classes in the past have always especially despised physical labor and physical laborers. They stubbornly regard the phenomenon of the division and opposition between mental and physical labor as eternal and immutable. In our feudal society, the two sentences "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" were often regarded as treasures by the rulers. In this way, they stubbornly regarded their rule and oppression of the workers and peasants as a matter of course. Modern bourgeois scholars are even racking their brains to try to prove from "theory" that the opposition between mental and physical labor is an "eternal law." The purpose is to confuse the fact that physical laborers directly produce material wealth to support them, while they cruelly oppress and exploit the broad masses of working people, attempt to create a sense of inferiority among the laboring people, and use this to frustrate the laboring people's will to struggle for liberation.
    Needless to say, all these statements are extremely absurd. Historical facts have long proved that under the primitive commune system, there was no division and opposition between mental and physical labor at all. The division and opposition between mental and physical labor arose with the emergence of the private system, and will inevitably disappear with the elimination of the private system.
    In socialist Soviet Union, with the elimination of capitalism and the exploitation system, the opposition between mental and physical labor was also eliminated. The socialist public ownership of the means of production gives all people the possibility to develop their mental and physical abilities equally fully; the relationship between mental laborers and physical laborers is no longer an opposing relationship, but a relationship of division of labor and cooperation between laborers. At present, there are still non-essential differences between mental and physical labor in the Soviet Union, which are traces of the separation of mental and physical labor caused by thousands of years of old social division of labor and class opposition. This difference lies in the fact that in socialist Soviet Union, the gap between the cultural and technical levels of workers and engineers and technicians has not yet been overcome. To overcome the gap between the cultural and technical levels of physical laborers and mental laborers, it is certainly necessary to rely on the more highly developed social production and the continuous upsurge of social culture and education. Therefore, this requires a considerable amount of time; however, this can certainly be done.
    After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, in accordance with the general task of the state in the transition period, it is necessary to gradually change capitalist ownership into socialist ownership, and gradually eliminate classes and exploitation, which makes it possible to gradually eliminate the opposition between mental and physical labor. Due to the state's concern for the cultural life of the laboring people, and the fact that the material living conditions of the laboring people have been improved day by day, they have the possibility to enjoy education. Because the laboring people have become the masters of the country, labor is no longer associated with a painful life, but with a happy future, which makes labor a conscious action of the laborers, thereby prompting physical laborers to have a greater desire to improve their culture. Thanks to the people's democratic regime, mental labor and physical labor have become part of the social labor that is beneficial to the common cause of the entire people. Moreover, due to the constant ideological education of Marxism-Leninism among the old intellectuals, they are also increasingly changing their views on physical labor.
    However, we cannot ignore the other aspect of the facts. This is that at present, class exploitation and the private system still exist, and the traditional influence of the exploiting classes for thousands of years has deeply poisoned people's minds. Not only is there a huge gap in cultural level between mental laborers and physical laborers, but also various prejudices against physical labor or mental labor have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, to eliminate the opposition and significant differences between mental and physical labor in our country, it is necessary to: on the one hand, gradually eliminate the economic basis that generates the opposition between mental and physical labor, and on the other hand, wage a struggle against the traditional ideas of the exploiting classes that despise physical labor.
    Building our country into a socialist country requires the hard work of millions of people to achieve. Without hard work, no beautiful ideals can be turned into reality. Moreover, the sacred cause of building a socialist society requires labor in many aspects. It needs mental laborers such as scientists and writers, and even more, hundreds of millions of physical laborers with a certain cultural level. The new society has opened up a path of true cultural development for all the people. Therefore, mental laborers must strive to connect with practice, and physical laborers must strive to improve their cultural and technical level, so that the cultural and technical levels of mental laborers and physical laborers will become closer and closer. One of the contents of comprehensively and correctly carrying out labor education is to point out that physical labor and mental labor have a significant role in the cause of socialist construction, and to point out that they are both necessary for building a socialist society and are glorious things. The erroneous view of despising physical labor and physical laborers is a reflection of the ideology of the exploiting classes. It hinders the political and spiritual unity of mental laborers and physical laborers, and also hinders the combination of mental laborers themselves with practice. As far as the broad masses of young students are concerned, it is necessary for some people to go to school for further studies; but according to the current situation and for a considerable period of time to come, it is also necessary for most people to directly participate in industrial, especially agricultural production after graduating from middle and primary schools. This new army of labor will greatly change the cultural quality of the physical labor force, which will not only help promote the elimination of the phenomenon of the division between mental labor and physical labor, but also directly help improve the technological level of industrial and agricultural production.

    正确地认识脑力劳动同体力劳动的关系
    周原冰
    目前，在对青年进行教育的工作中，不少人还有轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的错误观点。有些学生家长不愿意自己孩子从事体力劳动，甚至有些教师也在学生中有意无意地散布轻视体力劳动的观点。另一方面，有些地区在进行劳动教育的过程中，又发生了片面地强调体力劳动的重要而降低了甚至否定了脑力劳动的作用的偏向，错误地把体力劳动说成是唯一的劳动，以为只有参加直接生产劳动才是光荣的，甚至对希望升学的青年，采取了挖苦、讽刺的错误做法。
    要从根本上克服这两种错误观点，就必须科学地认识脑力劳动同体力劳动的关系。
    人是由类人猿进化来的。劳动在从猿到人的转变中起了决定作用。由于劳动，类人猿的前肢变成了人的手。所以恩格斯说：“手不但是劳动的器官，它还是劳动的产物。”（“自然辩证法”）手摆脱了脚的机能，人的祖先就逐渐学会了直立行走，并且，由于劳动的发展，互相帮助和共同活动的情形也增多了，这便引起了分节语的产生和发展。劳动和分节语对人的头脑的发展起了决定的影响。在劳动过程中，人的知觉和观念的范围日益扩大，感觉器官也日益完善。因此，人同其他动物所不同的地方，不仅在于人可以制造工具，而且在于人的劳动是有意识的。
    从人类劳动的起源和性质上说明了人类脑筋和人类的脑力劳动，是在人类的体力劳动的过程中形成和发展起来的。人类的一切物质生活资料，都是由体力劳动直接生产出来的。如果没有体力劳动和体力劳动者，那末人们就根本不可能获得这些物质生活资料，不论是科学家、文学家或者是工程师也就根本不能从事脑力劳动了。一切科学知识都是从劳动人民长期劳动实践的经验积累中总结出来的。如果没有体力劳动，脑力劳动者就既不能创造出什么东西来，也不能使其设想变成现实。看不到脑力劳动对于体力劳动的依存关系，片面地夸大脑力劳动的作用是一种唯心主义的论调。
    可是，这决不等于否定或者降低脑力劳动的作用。恰恰相反，人类开始了脑力劳动不仅在使人脱离动物界方面有着重大意义，而且此后在促进人类社会的发展以至对体力劳动的改进方面，都起着非常重大的作用。
    人类所赖以生活的各种物质资料的生产，本身就不仅仅是一种体力劳动，而且还包含人的脑力活动在内。马克思说：“在蜂房的建筑上，蜜蜂的本事，曾使许多以建筑师为业的人惭愧。但使最劣的建筑师都比最巧妙的蜜蜂更优越的，是建筑师以蜂蜡建筑蜂房以前，已经在他脑筋中把它构成了。”（“资本论”，第一卷）脑力劳动本是人类劳动中不可缺少的。固然，体力劳动是产生和进行脑力劳动的前提，但是脑力劳动又能推动体力劳动的改进和发展。因此，片面地夸大脑力劳动的作用是唯心主义的，但是片面地否定或者不正确地估计脑力劳动的作用也是不对的。
    在人类历史的初期阶段，由于没有私有财产，没有阶级和剥削，所以全体社会成员都是平等的；由于劳动工具很简陋和生产过程不复杂，所以没有而且也不可能有脑力劳动同体力劳动的分裂。但是，当社会生产力发展到可以获得除生产者本身的必需消费外而有一些剩余生产物的水平时，产生了生产资料私有制，出现了阶级和人剥削人的现象，从而开始了脑力劳动同体力劳动的分裂。
    阶级制度的形成使被剥削的劳动群众，只能从事疲惫不堪的体力劳动；而享受教育和从事脑力活动的权利，便被那些剥削者及其知识分子所专有了。并且，随着少数人对多数人的剥削的加深，脑力劳动同体力劳动的社会分工就日益加深和固定化起来。
    既然体力劳动者处于被剥削、被统治的地位，没有享受教育和从事脑力劳动的权利，既然这些权利为剥削阶级及其知识分子所专有，同时剥削阶级又利用其知识分子的脑力劳动来剥削体力劳动者，因而脑力劳动者就同体力劳动者处于对立地位。所以斯大林说：“脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的经济基础，是脑力劳动者对体力劳动者的剥削。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”）
    到了资本主义社会，特别是到了帝国主义时期，脑力劳动同体力劳动的对立，便达到尖锐化的程度。这是因为在资本主义制度下，人的劳动力也成了商品。资本家在购买劳动者的劳动力时力求价格低廉，而在剥削他们时又竭力榨取最大利润。为了便于统治和管理工人，资本家一面用苛重的劳动剥夺了工人接受教育的机会，一面把科学研究和企业的经营管理等脑力劳动同体力劳动分裂开来。知识分子的脑力劳动，也是被资本家当作商品购买来用以压迫和剥削工人，扩大他们利润的。这就使知识分子虽不同资本家处于同等地位，但又在事实上成为帮助资产阶级压迫和剥削工人的工具。这又是因为在资本主义制度下，技术的进步和机器的改良，并不是意味着工人劳动的减轻，而是意味着工人劳动强度的提高和剩余价值的增多。工人只能随着机器的转动做一些最单调最易学会的动作，沉重的劳动消耗了工人的全副精力，而脑力劳动的成就大都为资本家所窃夺而用来加重对体力劳动者的剥削，于是脑力劳动同体力劳动的对立就愈来愈尖锐。
    由此可见，脑力劳动同体力劳动的对立是一种历史现象。但是，历来的剥削阶级总是特别卑视体力劳动和体力劳动者。他们硬把脑力劳动同体力劳动分裂和对立的现象，说成是永恒不变的。在我国封建社会里，“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”这两句话，经常被统治者奉为至宝。这样，他们便硬把他们的统治和压迫工农劳动人民说成是理所当然的。现代资产阶级的学者们更在费尽心机地想从“理论”上来证明脑力劳动同体力劳动的对立是“永恒的法则”。其目的就在于混淆体力劳动者直接生产物质财富来供养他们，而让他们残酷地压迫和剥削着广大劳动人民的事实，企图造成劳动人民的自卑心理，并借以挫伤劳动人民争取解放的斗争意志。
    不消说，所有这些说法都是极其荒谬的。历史的事实早已证明在原始公社制度下，根本不存在什么脑力劳动同体力劳动的分裂和对立。脑力劳动同体力劳动的分裂和对立，随私有制度的产生而产生，也必将随私有制度的消灭而消灭。
    在社会主义的苏联，随着资本主义和剥削制度的消灭，脑力劳动同体力劳动的对立也消灭了。社会主义的生产资料公有制，给所有人们以发展脑力同发展体力同样充分的可能；脑力劳动者同体力劳动者的关系，已不再是什么对立的关系，而是劳动者彼此分工合作的关系。目前，在苏联还存在着脑力劳动同体力劳动的非本质差别，这是千百年旧的社会分工和阶级对立所造成的脑力劳动同体力劳动分离的痕迹。这个差别就在于在社会主义的苏联，工人同工程师技术人员的文化技术水平之间的悬殊还没有克服。要克服体力劳动者同脑力劳动者的文化技术水平之间的悬殊，当然要靠社会生产更为高度的发展和社会文化教育事业的不断高涨。因此，这需要相当长的时间；但是，这是一定可以做到的。
    中华人民共和国建立以后，依照国家在过渡时期的总任务，要逐步地把资本主义所有制改变为社会主义所有制，逐步地消灭阶级和剥削，这就有可能逐步地消灭脑力劳动同体力劳动的对立。由于国家对劳动人民文化生活的关怀，以及劳动人民的物质生活条件日益得到了改善，他们就有可能去享受教育。由于劳动人民做了国家的主人翁，劳动不再同痛苦的生活相联系，而同幸福的未来相联系，这就使劳动变成了劳动者的自觉行动，从而促使体力劳动者也更有提高自己文化的要求。由于有了人民民主政权，脑力劳动和体力劳动都成为对全体人民共同事业有益的社会劳动的一部分。并且，由于旧知识分子中经常受到马克思列宁主义的思想教育，他们也正在日益改变着他们对体力劳动的看法。
    可是，我们不能忽视另一方面的事实。这就是目前阶级剥削和私有制度依然存在，而千百年来剥削阶级的传统影响又深刻地毒害着人们的心灵。脑力劳动者同体力劳动者之间，不仅文化水平悬殊，而且人们对体力劳动或脑力劳动的各种偏见也还没有完全消灭。因此，要在我国消灭脑力劳动同体力劳动的对立和重大差别，就必须：一方面要逐步消灭产生脑力劳动同体力劳动对立的经济基础，另一方面要同剥削阶级那种轻视体力劳动的传统思想展开斗争。
    把我们的国家建设成为一个社会主义的国家，这是需要千百万人艰苦劳动才能实现的，不经过艰苦劳动，任何美好的理想都不能变成现实，并且，建设社会主义社会的神圣事业，需要的劳动还应是多方面的。它要有科学家和文学家一类的脑力劳动者，更要有成千成万的具有一定文化水平的体力劳动者。新社会已为全体人民开辟了真正文化发展的道路。因此，脑力劳动者必须努力同实际联系，体力劳动者必须努力提高自己的文化技术水平，以使脑力劳动者同体力劳动者的文化技术水平日益接近起来。全面地正确地进行劳动教育的内容之一，就是要指明体力劳动和脑力劳动对于社会主义建设事业都具有重大作用，指明它们都是建设社会主义社会所必需的，都是光荣的事情。那种轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的错误观点，是剥削阶级思想的反映。它阻碍着脑力劳动者同体力劳动者在政治上和精神上的一致，也阻碍着脑力劳动者本身同实践相结合。就广大的青年学生来说，一部分人升学求得深造，这是必要的；但根据目前以及相当长的时期内的情况，大部分人从中、小学毕业以后就要直接参加工业、特别是农业的生产，这也是必要的。这支新的劳动大军将大大改变体力劳动者队伍的文化质量，那就不但有利于促进脑力劳动同体力劳动分裂现象的消灭，而且更直接有利于工农业生产技术水平的提高。
