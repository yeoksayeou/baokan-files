Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 1st. After the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns" were announced, Shanghai's total sales of rice and flour decreased by 1.89 million jin in the five days from August 25th to 29th, compared to the same period last month.

This week was the last week of August, and many citizens automatically stopped purchasing the remaining amount of their August grain purchase plan because they had not finished eating the grain they already had. In the Kang Le Lane of the Jiangning District, three or four households in each of the ten residents' groups did this. A female worker, Guo Xiaomei, said, "Grain that isn't finished is better stored in the state's big warehouse than in my own little jar." Some cooked food shops, which used to buy up their full planned amount of grain at the end of the month to store it, even if they hadn't finished using it, also changed their practice. According to statistics from the state-owned No. 15 Grain Store, twenty-seven cooked food shops did not purchase the remaining two thousand four hundred plus jin of flour and japonica rice from their August grain purchase plan.

    定量供应办法公布后上海粮食销售量下降
    新华社上海一日电　“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”公布后，上海市自八月二十五日到二十九日五天内，全市大米、面粉销售量比上月同期减少一百八十九万斤。
    这一星期是八月份的最后一个星期，许多市民因为手中粮食没有吃完，自动不再购买八月份购粮计划的余额。江宁区康乐里的十个居民小组，每组都有三、四家是这样。女工郭小妹说：“吃不完的粮食放在国家大仓库内比放在自家的小缸内好得多。”以往粮食用不完，到月底还要把计划数量买足存起来的一些熟食店也改变了这种作法。据国营第十五粮店统计，八月份有二十七家熟食店没有购买用粮计划中剩余的二千四百多斤面粉、粳米等粮食。
