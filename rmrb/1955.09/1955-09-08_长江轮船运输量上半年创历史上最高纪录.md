Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th. The person in charge of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration told our reporter that the volume of shipping completed by ships on the entire Yangtze River line in the first half of this year increased by 78.68% compared with the same period in 1953, creating the highest record in the history of Yangtze River shipping. Eighty-eight percent of the goods transported were grain, coal, crude oil, steel, ore, and various building materials needed for national construction and people's livelihood. The increase in transport volume is inseparable from the increase in transport capacity, the improvement of waterways, the loading and unloading capacity of wharves, and the increase in transport efficiency. In the first half of this year, many new ships and oil tanker barges were added to the fleet sailing on the Yangtze River. Together with the batches of new ships launched in the past two years, the Yangtze River's transportation capacity has increased by more than 44%.

Yangtze River waterway staff have begun to change the natural state of the waterway according to plan. Before this year's flood season, the first group of workers and technicians to improve the Yangtze River waterway had already blasted many dangerous shoals in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. New Soviet lock-chain style navigation marks have been successively set up on the航线 from Hankou to Chongqing. The mileage of night航线 on the Yangtze River has been extended from Shanghai to Hankou, and then to Chongqing. According to statistics, the opening of segmented night航线 between Yichang and Chongqing alone can enable ships to complete the journey that originally took five days in four days. In addition, cranes, cranes, and loaders and unloaders have been successively added to the ports of Chongqing, Yichang, Hankou, Huangshi, Nanjing and other ports along the Yangtze River where freight transportation is busy, and the loading and unloading capacity of the ports has been enhanced.

Due to the creative labor of all the staff, the transportation efficiency of ships has also been continuously improved. For example, the "Liberation" passenger and cargo liner on the Han-Shanghai line used to take ten days for a round trip, which was shortened to eight days in 1953, and now it only takes six days. The coal transport fleet of towed barges from Pukou to Shanghai used to make a round trip in seven days. This year, after applying the Soviet experience of "ship operation chart", it only takes five days to make a round trip.

### 长江轮船运输量上半年创历史上最高纪录

    长江轮船运输量上半年创历史上最高纪录
    新华社武汉七日电　长江航运管理局负责人对本社记者说，今年上半年长江全线轮船完成的运输量比一九五三年同期提高百分之七十八点六八，创造了长江航运历史上的最高纪录。运输的货物中有百分之八十八是国家建设和人民生活需用的粮食、煤炭、原油、钢材、矿石和各种建筑材料。运输量的增加，是和运力增加、航道改善、码头装卸能力和运输效率的提高分不开的。今年上半年，在长江航行的船队中，又增加了许多新轮船和油罐驳，连同过去两年下水的各批新轮船，长江运力共已增加百分之四十四以上。
    长江航道工作人员已开始按计划改变航道的自然状态。到今年汛期以前，首批整治长江航道的工人和技术人员，已经在长江三峡爆破了许多滩险。从汉口到重庆的航线上，已先后设置苏联锁链式新式航标。长江夜航的里程已由上海到汉口，又延伸到了重庆。据统计，仅宜昌—重庆间开放的分段夜航，就能使轮船在四天内走完原需五天的航程。另外，在长江沿线货运繁忙的重庆、宜昌、汉口、黄石、南京等港口，都陆续增设了起重船、起重机和装卸车等，港口的装卸能力有了增强。
    由于全线职工的创造性劳动，轮船的运输效率也不断地提高了。例如汉申线客货班轮解放前往返一次需要十天，一九五三年缩短为八天，现在仅用六天时间就够了。从浦口开往上海的拖驳煤运船队，过去七天往返一次，今年运用苏联的“船舶运行图”经验后，只要五天就可往返一次。
