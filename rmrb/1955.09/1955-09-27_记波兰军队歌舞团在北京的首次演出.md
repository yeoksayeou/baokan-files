    Record of the First Performance of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble in Beijing
    Li Wei, Standing Director of the Chinese Musicians Association

    On the evening of September 24th, we watched the first performance of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble in Beijing with joyful, cordial, and excited feelings. We were intoxicated by the beautiful songs, dances, and music of the Polish people.

    The evening began with the national anthems of China and Poland and the "Polonaise"—a Polish folk dance. The large male choir of 110 people sang the national anthem of the People's Republic of China accurately in Chinese, followed by the national anthem of the People's Republic of Poland in Polish. This expression of Sino-Polish friendship immediately infected the audience. The "Polonaise" is an ancient Polish folk dance, popular throughout Poland. The music was written by Chopin, the most beloved great musician of the Polish people. Twenty pairs of male and female dancers, dressed in various costumes, including four dressed as Polish soldiers, moved in pairs with slow and steady steps to the stirring music, reminding people of the glorious cultural and artistic traditions of the Polish people and their happy lives today.

    Among the leaders of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble are three outstanding musicians: Colonel Teodor Ratkowski, the head of the ensemble, Adam Wiernik, the musical director, and Marian Sławiński, the choir conductor. Under their leadership and training, the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble has an excellent male choir and a first-class large orchestra. At the premiere performance in our country, they demonstrated their profound artistic attainments to the audience in Beijing.

    The male choir of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble has the following characteristics: it can skillfully control the volume, from extremely loud to extremely soft, with ease; it can give full play to the characteristics of each voice part, so that each part can be highlighted in turn with the changes in the range of the melody during the progress of the song. In this way, coupled with the purity of the sound quality and the accuracy of the scales, it can artistically express the emotions of each song.

    The chorus "Oka River" and "In the Home of Miller Malkin," composed by Colonel Ratkowski, show the life of the Polish People's Army. The former describes the time when the Polish army was established in 1943. The Polish First Division, named after Kościuszko, the leader of the Polish peasant uprising in the 18th century, was stationed on the Oka River in the Soviet Union. The Polish anti-fascist fighters saw that the scenery on the river bank was similar to the Vistula River in their homeland, which aroused feelings of missing their homeland in distress. The song expresses the soldiers' feelings from weak to strong, from lyrical to excited; and the accompaniment of the orchestra, with the silver bell-like glissando of the harp appearing in the light sound at the beginning, and other instruments appearing with undulating melodies from time to time in the interlude, depicting the image of the river. The latter song shows many young people courting the beautiful girl in the mill, and the girl's favorite is the young soldiers; the melody expresses a joyful and humorous atmosphere, and the various parts of the choir skillfully sing intricate musical phrases, bringing the audience to that noisy and enthusiastic scene.

    Comrade Sławiński personally conducted the three folk songs he arranged a cappella: "The First Hour," "Behind the Mountains and Forests," and "Marusha, Don't Go to the Forest!" The third of these was added when the audience enthusiastically welcomed them to "do one more." These three a cappella choruses fully demonstrate the choir's performance skills. The sound of the choir is completely controlled by Sławiński's two flexible and powerful hands, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes stopping, sometimes continuing, which is really intoxicating.

    The choir also performed Sławiński's "Song of the Motherland" and Szulc's "Lovely Homeland," the "Polish Revolutionary Song of 1905" which describes the first revolution against the Tsar's rule, the traditional song "Old Soldier Song Medley," the soldier song "Reed Flute," the folk song "Silesian Miner Suite," and "Mountain People Driving Sheep." These songs all educate the people to love their motherland, people, and army.

    The soldier song "Reed Flute" is a multi-sectional fast-paced short song, each section has eight bars in 4/4 time, singing a paragraph of lyrics, followed by the entire choir whistling a melody as an interlude. We can imagine how light and happy the soldiers would be singing this song while marching! At the evening party, this chorus was warmly welcomed by the audience and repeated once, and the applause lasted for a long time.

    The choir also sang the Chinese songs "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and "Long Live Chairman Mao," sang "Moscow-Beijing" in Chinese and Russian, and sang the Soviet army soldier song "The Sun Sets" in Russian, expressing the deep friendship between the peaceful, democratic, and socialist brotherly countries led by the Soviet Union.

    Soprano soloist Słonicka sang the excerpt "Yan Yan Goes to the River to Wash Clothes" from the Chinese opera "Chi Ye River" in Chinese and Polish, and added Rachmaninoff's "Georgian Song" at the request of the audience. Her beautiful voice softly sang these two lyrical tunes. Tenor soloist Pablocki sang "The Devil's Manor" and led the singing of "Mountain People Driving Sheep" and "Lovely Homeland." His voice is not only pure in timbre, but also high-pitched and powerful. Baritone soloist Wadyś sang "Warsaw - City of Peace" and led the singing of the Soviet song "On the Volga River." His range is very wide, and the timbre is pure and thick. When leading the singing of "On the Volga River," he expressed the simple character and working atmosphere of the working people. The three soloists all have their own merits and are worthy of our learning.

    The orchestra of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble is very outstanding. Under the direction of Wiernik, it took on the task of accompanying the chorus, soloists, and dances. The orchestra also performed symphonic pieces independently. At the premiere performance, we enjoyed the "Obertas" dance music performed independently by the orchestra, which is a melodious fast waltz. At the evening party, we also heard it play Chopin's "Polonaise" and dance accompaniment music from another great Polish musician, Moniuszko's "Polonaise" and "Mazurka." These performances accurately conveyed the infectiousness of the artistic works of the great composers. The string bass section, composed of six double basses, expressed such a strong harmonic root, the violins played very fast and continuously, the sound of the wind instruments was very soft, and the sound of the harp was like a high mountain flowing water from time to time...

    At this evening party, the dance team of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble performed seven dances (including the "Polonaise" as the prelude).

    "Sailor Dance" shows the life of Polish Navy sailors. It uses graceful dance to show the military labor life of sailors on warships, and the party between twenty-one sailors and eight visiting girls. From the dance, we can see the Polish sailors' forthright and cheerful personality, as well as the harmonious relationship between the military and the people. "Liubersy Dance" is performed by sixteen pairs of men and women, the women are dressed in gorgeous Lublin region national costumes, the men are wearing straw hats, the dance music is a fast waltz, and the dance is very lively and enthusiastic. "Obertas Dance" is also a fast waltz, composed of sixteen pairs of men and women, but the dance organization, actor costumes and style are different from the former. This is a folk dance from Łowicz, west of Mazovia. At the beginning, eight girls surround a young man and play, then there are sixteen pairs of couples dancing and various stunt performances. The women wear multi-layered floral skirts and white headscarves; the men wear black vests, yellow striped trousers, and small black felt hats. The whole dance is fast and powerful.

    The "Krakowiak Dance" originated in the Krakow region, the ancient capital of Poland. It is a dance that was collected and processed by the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble, showing the life of the people's struggle. The theme shows the joyful scene of the Polish people defeating the Tatar invasion in the fifteenth century. During the dance, two disguised Tatars on horseback are interspersed, surrounded by a group of young men and women, and driven off the stage. In conjunction with various beautiful compositions and formations, interspersed with special skill performances such as jumps, spins, and leaps, the scene ends with all the actors lining up and raising their hands, showing the heroic spirit of the people raising their heads. This dance was personally rehearsed by Comrade Kalinowski, the dance director of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble, in Warsaw, and taught to the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The people of Beijing have seen this program many times from the performances of the Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, and now they can directly see the performance of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble, of course, they are very happy and feel very kind. Therefore, the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble had to replay this program for the enthusiastic audience during the performance.

    The Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble learned the "Picking Tea and Catching Butterflies" dance from the Chinese art troupe participating in the Youth Festival in Warsaw, and successfully performed it in Beijing this time. It is very rare that the Polish actresses completely showed the temperament and dance style of Chinese girls, and Wanda Kukułka, the actress who played the butterfly, also developed the dance of the butterfly role, making her have a distinct, lively and innocent character.

    The evening ended with a large dance "Polonaise, Mazurka." This is a dance scene from the Polish opera "Halka," composed by Moniuszko. Forty male and female actors are wearing very beautiful national costumes, all with very beautiful shawls, the women wear tight skirts, the men wear satin hats, tie belts, and wear sabers. The choir stands in the depths of the stage, singing for the dance.

    We can see from these dance programs that the dancers of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble have good training. The programs they perform are full of life, the dance style is healthy and powerful, and the dance music is very pleasant. This makes their dance programs have a cordial popularity and the vigorous spirit of the people of the new era. (Attached picture)

    记波兰军队歌舞团在北京的首次演出
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　李伟
    九月二十四日晚上，我们带着愉快、亲切、兴奋的心情，观看了波兰军队歌舞团在北京的首次演出。我们被波兰人民优美的歌、舞和乐曲所陶醉了。
    晚会是以中、波两国的国歌和“波洛乃兹舞”——波兰民间舞为序幕开始的。由一百一十人组成的大型男声合唱队，用中文确切地演唱了中华人民共和国国歌，紧接着用波文演唱了波兰人民共和国国歌，这种中波友谊的表示即时感染了观众。“波洛乃兹舞”是波兰古老的民间舞蹈，流行在波兰各地，舞曲是波兰人民最心爱的大音乐家萧邦写的；二十对男女舞蹈演员穿着各种服装，其中有四人是波军战士打扮，成对的舞伴，用缓慢而稳重的舞步，随着那动人心魄的音乐行进着，使人们想到波兰人民光辉的文化艺术传统和今天的幸福生活。
    波军歌舞团的领导人中间，有三位出色的音乐家：团长特奥尔·拉特科夫斯基上校，音乐指导阿达姆·维尔尼克和合唱指挥马利扬·萨瓦茨基。在他们的领导和训练之下，波军歌舞团有着一个优秀的男声合唱队和一个第一流的大型管弦乐队。在访问我国首次演出的晚会上，他们就把自己的高深的艺术素养显示给北京的听众了。
    波军歌舞团的男声合唱队具备了这样的特色：能巧妙地控制音量，从极强到极弱，都能运用自如；能发挥各个声部的特点，在歌曲旋律的进行中，使各声部随着曲调音域的变化而轮替突出。这样，加上音质的洁美和音阶的准确，就能艺术地表达出每个歌曲的感情。
    由拉特科夫斯基上校作曲的合唱“俄喀河”和“在磨房主马尔金的家中”，表现了波兰人民军队的生活面貌。前者描写一九四三年波军建军时期，以波兰十八世纪农民起义的领袖科斯久什科命名的波兰第一师，驻扎在苏联境内的俄喀河上，波兰反法西斯战士们看到河岸风景和自己祖国的维斯杜拉河相似，引起了怀念苦难中的祖国的感情。歌曲由弱到强，从抒情到激动，表达了战士们的心情；而乐队的伴奏，在开头的轻音中出现了竖琴的银铃般的滑音，其它乐器在间奏中时时出现起伏的旋律，刻划出河水的形象。后一个歌曲表现很多年轻人向磨房里美丽的姑娘求爱，而姑娘最爱的是年轻的战士们；曲调表现了欢乐诙谐的气氛，合唱队各个声部巧妙地唱出错综复杂的乐句，把听众带到那个喧嚣而热情的场面里去了。
    萨瓦茨基同志亲自指挥了他自己编曲的三个民歌无伴奏合唱：“第一小时”、“在高山和森林的后边”和“玛露霞，不要到森林去！”其中第三个是听众热烈欢迎他们“再来一个”的时候加唱的。这三个无伴奏合唱，充分地表现了合唱队的表演技巧。合唱队的声音完全由萨瓦茨基的两只灵活而有力的手控制着，忽强忽弱，忽快忽慢，忽停忽续，真是令人陶醉。
    在合唱中，还表演了萨瓦茨基作曲的“祖国之歌”和希果津斯基作曲的“可爱的故乡”，表演了描写反抗沙皇统治的第一次革命的“一九○五年波兰革命之歌”，传统歌曲“旧士兵歌曲联唱”，士兵歌曲“芦笛”、民歌“西里西亚矿工组歌”和“山民赶着羊群”。这些歌曲都是教育人民热爱自己的祖国、人民和军队的。
    士兵歌曲“芦笛”是一首多段体快速进行的短歌，每段有四四拍子的八个小节，唱一段词，接着全合唱队用口哨吹一段曲调作为间奏。我们可以想得到，战士们在行进中唱着这个歌曲，会是多么轻快、高兴！在晚会上，这个合唱为听众热烈欢迎，重唱了一次，掌声还持续了很久。
    合唱队还演唱了中国歌曲“中国人民解放军进行曲”和“万岁毛泽东”，用中文和俄文演唱了“莫斯科—北京”，又用俄文演唱了苏军士兵歌曲“太阳落山”，表现了以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义兄弟国家之间的深厚的友谊。
    女高音独唱演员斯沃尼茨卡用中文和波文独唱了中国歌剧“赤叶河”选曲“燕燕下河洗衣裳”，并且在听众要求之下加唱了拉赫曼尼诺夫作曲的“格鲁吉亚之歌”。她的动听的歌喉，柔美地唱出了这两首抒情的曲调。男高音独唱演员帕布洛茨基独唱了“魔鬼的庄园”，并且领唱了“山民赶着羊群”和“可爱的故乡”。他的声音不仅音质很纯，而且高亢有力。男中音独唱演员瓦蒂什独唱了“华沙——和平的城市”，并且领唱了苏联歌曲“在伏尔加河上”。他的音域很宽，音质纯厚，领唱“在伏尔加河上”的时候，表达了劳动人民淳朴的性格和劳动的气氛。三位独唱家都有独到之处，是值得我们学习的。
    波军歌舞团的管弦乐队是很出色的。它在维尔尼克的指挥下，担任了合唱、独唱和舞蹈的伴奏的任务。乐队还单独演奏了交响乐曲。在首次演出的晚会上，我们欣赏了乐队单独演奏的“奥别尔塔斯”舞曲，这是一个动听的快三步舞曲。我们在晚会上还听到它演奏了萧邦的“波洛乃兹”和另一个波兰大音乐家莫纽什科的“波洛乃兹”和“玛佐卡”的舞蹈伴奏曲，这些演奏都准确地传达出了伟大作曲家们的艺术作品中的感染力。由六个倍低音提琴组成的弦乐低音部表现了那么雄厚的合声根音，小提琴则十分快速地、连续地拉奏着，管乐的声音非常柔和，竖琴的声音则如高山流水一般地时时突现……
    在这个晚会上，波军歌舞团舞蹈队表演了七个舞蹈（包括作为序幕的“波洛乃兹”）。
    “水兵舞”是表现波军水兵生活的。它用优美的舞姿表演了水兵在军舰上的军事劳动生活，二十一个水兵与来访的八个少女的联欢。从舞蹈中可以看出波兰水兵们的豪爽、开朗的性格，以及融洽的军民关系。“留别里舞”由十六对男女来表演，女的穿着华丽的卢布林地区民族服装，男的头戴草帽，舞曲是快三步的，舞蹈十分活泼热烈。“奥别尔塔斯舞”也是一个快三步舞，由十六对男女组成，但舞蹈组织、演员服饰和风格和前者不同。这是玛佐夫舍西部罗维契地方的民间舞，一开始由八个少女围起一个青年小伙子玩耍，然后是十六对双人舞和各种特技表演。女的穿着多层的花裙，戴着白头纱；男的穿着黑坎肩、黄条裤，戴着小黑毡帽，整个舞蹈是快速而有力的。
    “克拉科维亚克舞”原产生在波兰古都克拉科夫地区，是经波军歌舞团采集加工的、表现人民斗争生活的舞蹈。主题表现十五世纪波兰人民战胜鞑靼人的侵略之后的欢乐场面。舞蹈进行中穿插了化装的两个骑马的鞑靼人，被一群青年男女们围起来，并驱逐他们下场。配合着各种优美的构图和队形，穿插了跳转、旋子、跳跃等特技表演，而以全体演员列队高举双手的场面结束，表现人民抬起头来的英雄气概。这个舞蹈，曾在华沙由波军歌舞团舞蹈指导卡里诺夫斯基同志亲自排练，教会了中国人民解放军歌舞团。北京人民已多次从解放军歌舞团的演出中看了这个节目，而现在能直接看到波军歌舞团的表演，当然是非常高兴并感到十分亲切的。因此，这个节目在演出时，波军歌舞团不得不为热情的观众们重演一次。
    波军歌舞团在华沙向参加青年联欢节的中国艺术团学习了“采茶捕蝶”舞，此次在北京成功地演出了它。波兰的女演员们这样完全地表现出中国姑娘的气质和舞蹈风格，而且由女演员万达·库克尤卡扮演的蝴蝶，还发展了蝴蝶这一角色的舞蹈，使她具备了鲜明的、活泼天真的性格，这是十分难得的。
    晚会以大型的舞蹈“波洛乃兹、玛佐卡”结束。这是波兰歌剧“哈尔卡”中的一个舞蹈场面，作曲者是莫纽什科。四十个男女演员们穿着十分美丽的民族服装，都带有很漂亮的披肩，女的穿紧身的裙子，男的戴着缎帽，扎着腰带，挎着战刀。合唱队立在舞台深处，为舞蹈伴唱。
    我们从这些舞蹈节目中，可以看出波军歌舞团的舞蹈演员们都有良好的训练。他们表演的节目都充满着生活气息，舞蹈风格是健康有力的，舞曲非常悦耳。这就使得他们的舞蹈节目具备了亲切的人民性和新时代人民的生气勃勃的精神。（附图片）
