    Vigorously Promote Overall Thrift, Overcome All Waste

    To ensure the comprehensive and consistent development of thrift work, industrial production units in Shanghai, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, formulated a thrift plan after repeated studies on three occasions. During the first accounting, most enterprises limited themselves to the activities of a few people and did not mobilize the masses. As a result, the plans formulated were general, incomplete, and conservative. The Municipal Committee was not satisfied with this approach and instructed each enterprise to re-account specifically according to different content. For example, when calculating the reduction of costs, the plan should include the unit consumption of materials (saving raw materials, using substitutes, using waste materials, etc.), reducing the defective product rate (what was the rate in the past, how much can it be reduced, how to reduce it, etc.), and saving management expenses (the proportion previously accounted for in the cost, what waste exists, how to compress it, etc.). The second accounting enabled the enterprises to further understand the problems existing in their work; however, many enterprises still failed to formulate comprehensive thrift plans and did not mobilize the masses of workers to participate in discussions. Some plans were still conservative. Therefore, the Municipal Committee launched another review of enterprises: checking whether the basis of the calculation was correct, whether there were any repetitions or false phenomena; whether the increase in production was estimated in terms of supply and sales balance; whether the thrift plan was comprehensive and whether there were any specific measures; and whether several important economic indicators had been compared with units of the same type and whether they were advanced. Then, the results of the review were submitted to the masses for discussion.

    The three detailed calculations yielded great results. First, the masses were mobilized, a struggle was launched against various conservative ideas, and the planned targets of many units were raised compared to the past. The entire state-owned industrial system increased output value by 38.66 million yuan, saved 42.69 million yuan, and increased profits turned over to the state by 39.74 million yuan in the second half of the year. Second, the thrift plan was more comprehensive, paying attention to all aspects of supply and sales balance, improving quality, and reducing costs, which helped to improve enterprise management and make thrift a regular practice. Third, because the masses discussed the plan, reliable methods for completing the plan were found. Fourth, by identifying the important problems existing in enterprises, it became possible to take effective measures to eliminate weak links in the work and ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan.

    To consolidate this achievement, the Municipal Committee instructed each enterprise to quickly issue the thrift targets to the workshops, let the masses discuss them, continue to revise the unreasonable parts, and mobilize the masses to formulate guarantees. By August 10th, each enterprise had completed this work.

    After the thrift plan is issued to the workshops, the task of the leading organs is to regularly and promptly check the implementation of the plan, overcome various difficulties and ideological obstacles, and make the plan a reality. Of course, it is impossible to fully understand all the problems existing in the thrift work of each enterprise shortly after the plan is issued to the workshops. However, it is necessary and possible to check one or several of the most prominent problems existing in thrift work and promptly sound the alarm to each enterprise. For this reason, the Municipal Committee convened a city-wide conference of party member cadres from enterprises, government agencies, and organizations on August 22nd, focusing on criticizing the lack of a comprehensive thrift perspective and the neglect of product quality.

    According to the Municipal Committee's inspection, during this period, the quality of some products, especially light industrial products, had clearly declined. Some were even industry-wide declines. What is serious is that the decline in product quality was entirely man-made, not due to insurmountable technical reasons.

    There are many manifestations of neglecting product quality.

    Some enterprises almost intentionally reduce product quality. Several state-owned cigarette factories have generally experienced light, heavy, and empty cigarettes in order to save tobacco leaves. The No. 2 Cigarette Factory saved 6,927 kilograms of leaves more than the original plan in July. The methods were: light cigarettes, which did not reach the prescribed weight, "saving" 5,198 kilograms; high moisture content of tobacco, "producing" 1,215 kilograms more tobacco; and many empty cigarettes, with the workshop "recovering" 2,966 kilograms of tobacco. On the other hand, due to the failure to complete the ash loss plan, 1,888 kilograms of tobacco leaves were wasted, and 563 kilograms were wasted for other reasons. The No. 4 Cigarette Factory adopted the same method and saved 19,227 kilograms of tobacco leaves more than the thrift plan in July. Sixty percent of the cigarettes produced were light. Similar phenomena were observed in other factories such as the No. 1, No. 3 and many joint state-private cigarette factories.

    Some enterprises did not do a good job of trial production and technical preparation when saving raw materials, using substitutes, and waste materials, and blindly put them into production, which reduced product quality. In order to save 4 liang of aluminum per furnace of steel, the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant produced a large amount of steel without sufficient testing, resulting in more than 400 tons of waste steel, which was a loss. When some local state-owned and joint state-private factories made flashlights, they used iron instead of copper. Due to insufficient technical preparation, the electroplating of the products produced was too thin and easy to rust; the screw threads were very shallow and could not be tightened; the joints were not tightly welded and cracked quickly; and the alignment was inaccurate. Some products used substitutes that should not have been used, such as using aluminum alloy instead of copper for the reeds of an organ, which is prone to rust and inaccurate sound.

    The raw materials of some products have changed, but the management personnel of the enterprise have insufficient understanding of this new situation and have not taken effective technical and organizational measures, resulting in a large amount of loss. Since July, 25% of the raw cotton used by Shanghai's cotton mills has been yellow cotton, with very short fibers and poor tensile strength; the other 75% is imported cotton, with impurities as high as 7% to 9%. However, the No. 4, No. 10, and No. 13 State-owned Cotton Mills did not carefully study technical measures based on the raw material situation, and the amount of cotton used exceeded the national quota, and the quality only reached 29.8% to 36.25%.

    There are also some enterprises that had chaotic technical management in the past and still do not pay attention to improvement, so the product quality cannot be improved, and a lot of waste products are produced. Due to the chaotic system of batching, sampling, sample selection, and large samples in the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory, the color of the printed fabrics is dull and the patterns are not new compared to other parts of the country. Sometimes the color is light, brittle, discolored, and spotted. In the No. 3 State-owned Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory, people working in the sterile studio did not strictly abide by the technical regulations, entered the work without disinfection, the glass wool used to filter the air on the windows was broken for a long time, no one cared about it, the staff often went in and out, the doors were often open and not closed, and some people even defecated in the room, bringing in a lot of bacteria. Eighteen batches of 120 batches of raw materials produced in August were infected, and 325,172 bottles of penicillin were scrapped, worth more than 99,000 yuan. Due to the chaotic technical management of the joint state-private Kefar Pharmaceutical Factory, 4 million tablets in the second quarter could not be shipped because they contained iron filings and were moldy.

    The Municipal Committee criticized the above-mentioned erroneous practices at the meeting, instructing all enterprises to check this issue, quickly take effective technical measures, improve product quality, and comprehensively carry out thrift work to ensure the comprehensive completion of the various indicators of the 1955 National Plan and the completion of the increase in production and thrift plan. Now, each enterprise is correcting the bias of neglecting quality according to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, and further comprehensively launching thrift work.

专栏：厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费

    经常关心节约工作的全面发展
    本报记者　顾雷
    为保证全面和经常地开展节约工作，上海市工业生产单位在中共上海市委员会领导下，经过三次反复研究，制定了节约计划。第一次算账时，大部分企业只限于少数人的活动，没有发动群众，因而订出的计划是笼统的、不全面的、保守的。市委不满意这种做法，指示各企业要分别不同内容，重新具体地算账。例如，算降低成本的账时，应包括材料的单位用量（节约原材料、利用代用品、利用废料等）、降低废品率（过去是多少、能降低多少、如何降低等）和节约管理费用（过去在成本中所占的比例、有那些浪费、如何压缩）的计划。第二次算账使各企业进一步摸清了工作中存在的问题；但仍有许多企业没有订出全面的节约计划，没有发动广大工人群众参加讨论，有些计划依然是保守的。于是市委又发动各企业进行复核：检查计算的基础是否正确，有无重复、虚假现象；增产的数字是否估计到供销平衡；节约计划是否全面、有无具体措施；几个重要的经济指标，是否同同类型的单位比较过，是否先进。接着将复查的结果交给群众讨论。
    三次算细账，收获很大。第一，发动了群众，向各种保守思想进行了斗争，使许多单位的计划指标比过去提高了。全部国营工业系统，下半年增加产值三千八百六十六万元、节约四千二百六十九万元、增加上缴利润三千九百七十四万元。第二、节约计划比较全面，注意了供销平衡、提高质量、降低成本等各个方面，有助于提高企业管理水平和使节约经常化；第三，由于群众讨论了这个计划，找到了完成计划的可靠的方法。第四，摸清了企业存在的重要问题，就有可能采取有效的办法消灭工作中的薄弱环节，保证全面完成国家计划。
    为巩固这一成就，市委指示各企业迅速把节约指标下达车间，让群众讨论，继续修正不合理部分，发动群众制定保证条件。八月十日以前，各企业完成了这一工作。
    节约计划下达车间后，领导机关的任务就是要经常地、及时地检查计划执行情况，克服各种困难和思想障碍，使计划变成现实。当然，计划下达车间不久，不可能全面了解各企业节约工作中存在的所有问题。但是，检查节约工作中存在一个或几个最突出的问题，及时向各企业敲响警钟，则是必要的，可能的。为此，市委在八月二十二日又召开了全市各企业、机关、团体党员干部大会，着重批评了缺乏全面节约观点、忽视产品质量的做法。
    根据市委的检查，这一时期，有些产品，特别是轻工业产品的质量是显然下降了。有些甚至是行业性的下降。而严重的是，有些产品质量下降完全是人为的，而不是在技术上遇到不可抗拒的原因。
    忽视产品质量的表现很多。
    有一些企业几乎是有意地降低产品质量。几个国营烟厂为了节约烟叶，普遍发生烟支偏轻、偏重、空头的现象。制烟第二厂七月份比原计划多节约了六千九百二十七公斤叶子，办法是：烟支偏轻，达不到规定的份量，“节省”五千一百九十八公斤；烟丝水份高，“多出”烟丝一千二百十五公斤；烟的空头多，车间“回收”烟丝二千九百六十六公斤。另一面，由于未完成灰损计划，却浪费了烟叶一千八百八十八公斤，由于其他原因浪费了五百六十三公斤。制烟四厂采取同样办法，七月份比节约计划多省下一万九千二百二十七公斤烟叶，所生产的纸烟偏轻的占百分之六十。其他如制烟一厂、三厂及许多公私合营烟厂，都有类似现象。
    有一些企业在节约原料、利用代用品和废料时，没有做好试制工作，没有做好技术准备，便盲目投入生产，以致降低了产品质量。上海钢铁厂为了在每炉钢中节省四两铝，没有充分试验就大量生产，结果出了四百多吨废钢，得不偿失。地方国营和公私合营的某些厂做手电筒时，用铁皮代铜，因技术准备不够，生产出的产品电镀太薄，易生锈；螺丝纹很浅，拧不紧；接缝处焊得不严，很快开裂；对光不准。有的产品不该使用代用材料也使用了，如用铝合金代替铜做风琴的簧，容易生锈，发音也不准确。
    有一些产品的原料已经改变，但由于企业管理人员对这种新情况认识不足，没有采取有效的技术组织措施，以致造成大量的损失。从七月份起，上海的棉纺厂使用的原棉，有百分之二十五是黄花，纤维很短，拉力又差；另外的百分之七十五是进口花，杂质多达百分之七至百分之九。但国棉四厂、十厂和十三厂没有根据原料情况认真研究技术措施，用棉量都超过了国家规定的指标，质量只达百分之二十九点八到百分之三十六点二五。
    还有一些企业过去技术管理混乱，现在还不注意改善，结果产品质量不能提高，生产了很多废品。上海印染厂由于配料、采样、选样、大样等制度混乱，印染出的花布和全国其他各地比，颜色暗淡、花样不新颖，有时色浅、发脆、褪色、有斑点。国营上海制药三厂，由于在无菌工作室里工作的人不严格遵守技术规程，不消毒就进去工作，窗子上装的过滤空气用的玻璃棉破了很久也无人过问，工作人员经常出出进进，房门经常开着不关，有人甚至还在屋内大便，以致带进去很多细菌，八月份生产的一百二十批原料，有十八批染菌，报废三十二万五千一百七十二瓶青霉素，价值九万九千多元。公私合营科发药厂，因技术管理混乱，第二季度就有四百万片片剂因夹有铁屑和发毛而不能出厂。
    市委在会议上批判了上述各种错误做法，指示所有企业必须对这个问题进行检查，迅速采取有效的技术措施，提高产品质量，使节约工作全面地开展，以保证全面完成一九五五年国家计划的各项指标和完成增产节约计划。现在，各企业正根据市委的指示，纠正忽视质量的偏向，进一步地全面地展开节约工作。
