    Vigorously Promote Sales Work to Bring Department Store Industrial Products to the Countryside
    Fan Taozhai, Deputy Manager of China National Department Store Corporation
    Since April of this year, the state-owned department store sector has not fulfilled its sales plan. From January to August, only 52% of the annual plan was completed nationwide, leaving 48% of the sales target to be achieved in the next four months. Among the 32 major commodities handled by the department store system, only three completed their sales plans in the first half of the year. In particular, sales volumes of rubber shoes, sewing machines, steel pots, soaps, thermos bottles, enamel basins, bicycles, and flashlights from January to August were lower than the level of the same period last year. This situation has affected the supply of consumer goods to urban and rural residents. All staff of the state-owned department store must work hard to change this situation, seize the opportunity, concentrate all efforts, and organize supplies vigorously according to the different needs of cities and villages, especially the needs of the vast number of farmers, and strive to over fulfill the sales plan for the fourth quarter, thereby ensuring the completion of the annual sales task.
    The market is now gradually entering the peak season. The characteristics of this year's market are: agricultural production has had a bumper harvest in most areas, and state procurement is more concentrated, rural purchasing power will increase significantly, and purchasing power will also increase greatly in areas that suffered heavy disasters last year but have a bumper harvest this year. According to our rough calculations, the purchasing power of the vast number of people for department store goods only realized 39% in the first half of this year, and the purchasing power in the second half of the year will increase much more than in the first half. This year's department store market will see a "peak season" become even more "peak," and the rise in our fourth-quarter sales will inevitably exceed the rules of previous years. With the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain, the people's food problems have been reasonably solved, and cotton cloth is supplied in fixed quantities, the demand for daily necessities will inevitably increase. At the same time, the state-owned department store system implemented off-season storage work in the first half of the year, over fulfilling the procurement plan. The inventory of most commodities increased by more than 25% compared with the same period last year, and 60% to 70% of the commodities have been distributed to the department stores of the special zones and counties to meet the peak season supply. In particular, relatively sufficient material resources have been prepared for the supply to the rural market, providing favorable conditions for carrying out sales promotion work and completing the plan.
    The peak season for trade has begun, and favorable conditions are available. However, we still have many problems in our work: First, negative emotions are generated and growing in the minds of some employees and individual unit leaders. Their estimates of the characteristics of this year's peak season are insufficient. They blindly shout that the task is too large, and they lack confidence in completing the sales plan. The fourth-quarter sales plans reported by many provinces and cities are all too small; second, wholesale work is not being carried out quickly enough. The peak season sales promotion work has not been vigorously and comprehensively carried out throughout the system; third, the combination with cooperatives is not good enough. We lack active help to cooperatives in purchasing goods to supply the needs of the rural market, so there are still many problems with the continued distribution of industrial products from county stores. Many commodities are in stock but are not available in the retail commercial network, and the masses cannot buy them. Unwarranted out-of-stock phenomena have occurred in the grassroots market; fourth, in terms of the cadre allocation of the grassroots wholesale stores, many units are still not adapted to the current tasks. For example, the Dongtai Store in Jiangsu Province has an annual sales target of 4.5 million yuan, manages 4,493 varieties of goods, and has two wholesale departments. There are only 14 people, including the director. They have to face the wholesale of 21 grassroots cooperatives and hundreds of private peddlers. They are too busy doing business in the wholesale department all day long, and they cannot lead private merchants well. Even few people contact the cooperatives. If the above situation is not changed quickly, it will not only seriously affect the completion of the sales task of the state-owned department store, but it will also seriously affect the procurement of agricultural products, which is extremely detrimental to the country and the people.
    In order to strengthen the peak season supply and ensure the completion and strive to over fulfill the annual sales task, state-owned department stores at all levels should quickly overcome all ideological obstacles, immediately shift the focus of leadership to carrying out vigorous sales promotion work, and master the following basic links:
    First, we must make the greatest efforts to ensure the completion of the sales task. The leaders of the state-owned commercial system should educate all employees to understand that 1955 is a critical year for completing the Five-Year Plan, and the fourth quarter is the key to completing the annual plan in the commercial field. The realization of the sales plan means that we have supplied a large number of industrial products to the people, especially the vast number of farmers, through many organizational work to meet their needs. It effectively supports the procurement of agricultural products, which can recover currency, stabilize prices, expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, we have sold a large number of commodities stored in the off-season, which is conducive to accelerating capital turnover, reducing circulation costs, and completing the task of accumulating funds for national industrialization. Therefore, vigorously carrying out sales promotion work, supplying industrial products to farmers, and meeting the needs of farmers have become extremely important political and economic tasks of the state-owned department store.
    Second, further carry out sales promotion work with wholesale as the main focus to ensure peak season supply. Provincial (municipal) companies must act quickly, grasp the leadership of sales promotion work, discover problems in a timely manner, analyze and study them, and propose practical and feasible solutions. The inventory of second-level stations, all those that are transported and sold to the countryside, should continue to be transferred to the county level, and at the same time, we must pay close attention to prevent blindness, and strive to avoid the phenomenon of incorrect goods and untimely allocation. For example, provincial companies such as Guangdong, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Heilongjiang have already formed sales promotion offices led by the manager, which regularly comprehensively analyzes market changes and business operations, publishes regular bulletins on sales promotion, strengthens the supervision and inspection of affiliated grassroots stores, and helps solve all problems related to hindering the sales promotion of industrial products in a timely manner. This practice is worth promoting. However, some provinces and cities and many branch companies at the first-level do not pay enough attention to this work, which weakens the leadership of the sales promotion work. Therefore, all provincial (municipal) companies and branch companies are required to quickly establish sales promotion offices to strengthen the leadership of sales promotion work. The wholesale work of grassroots stores must also be strengthened. Some provinces, such as Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hunan, have either replenished their external liaison personnel or held commercial supply meetings between state-owned and cooperative sectors, and the sales promotion of department store industrial products has made progress. However, in some units, such as Shijiazhuang and Yangliuqing Special Zone stores in Hebei Province, the number of external wholesale personnel was greatly reduced in July, which is not in line with the requirements of strengthening wholesale work, and this practice must be changed quickly.
    Third, the rural market is currently led and arranged by supply and marketing cooperatives. Therefore, to carry out sales promotion work with wholesale as the main focus, we must first ensure that the business of the special zone and county department stores and the grassroots cooperatives are closely connected, quickly strengthen contact and assistance to the cooperatives, and fully supply the commodities required by the grassroots cooperatives. In the first half of this year, due to the handling of inventory backlogs by cooperatives, the purchase of industrial products was once reduced. Currently, the market is facing the peak season, and the task of rural supply is even more arduous. The inventory of cooperatives is reduced, and they must replenish the industrial products needed by the masses. We should check and overcome the shortcomings of insufficient assistance to the work of cooperatives in the past, and take the initiative to actively strengthen the connection with grassroots cooperatives, adopting various methods such as holding commercial supply meetings between state-owned and cooperative sectors, jointly holding industrial product exhibitions, and assigning areas for responsibility, and going to the countryside with samples to help them carry out wholesale business to rural peddlers and hawkers, rationally expand the variety of goods, actively organize the source of small department store goods in the local and nearby areas, and do everything possible to meet the purchase requirements of cooperatives to expand the scope of department store industrial products to the countryside. Secondly, strengthen the leadership of urban private retailers and small merchants, and widely and actively organize them to purchase goods from state-owned department stores through distribution and agency sales, actively promote sales at state-owned retail prices, give full play to their business enthusiasm, and serve to expand commodity circulation, so that market arrangements are combined with socialist transformation.
    Fourth, focus on major commodities and seasonal commodities, and use various practical methods to boldly and vigorously promote sales. Planned commodities operated by the department store system account for more than 60% of the total sales. The sales plan was not completed in the first half of the year, which affected the completion of the entire sales task. However, the inventory strength is sufficient, especially the sales of rubber shoes, glass, towels, socks, enamel basins, enamel cups, flashlights, soaps, toothpaste, bamboo and thermos bottles, sewing machines, radios, bicycles, etc. are even worse, and sugar has not completed the sales plan either. Therefore, effective sales promotion measures should be taken for each commodity. The commodities in the warehouses of wholesale stores should be displayed separately in state-owned retail stores, cooperative retail stores, and private retail stores. Publicity should be strengthened for the commodities that have recently been reduced in price in batches, and sales should be carried out boldly. As for wool yarn, woolen fabrics, health shirts and pants, cotton wool shirts and pants, and cotton wool socks and other autumn and winter commodities will gradually sell well. The source and placement of these commodities should be checked by each province and city, and efforts should be made to basically sell them all in the wholesale link before the end of the season, and there should be no conservative reluctance to sell due to the peak season sales or a slight shortage of supply.
    Fifth, timely do a good job of allocation, transportation, and commodity adjustment, which has a great relationship with supporting the vigorous promotion of sales during the peak season. The central procurement and supply station and second-level stations should do a good job of transfer and transportation quickly and in a timely manner in accordance with the contract, and special personnel should be transferred to the second-level stations and third-level stores for sales promotion visits. In addition to introducing inventory commodities to sales units and helping them supplement marketable commodities to do a good job in sales, they should also humbly listen to and collect the reflections and requirements of units at all levels and consumers on the quality, variety, color, specifications, and prices of the commodities they operate, and carefully study them to improve future guidance for production and organization of procurement and supply. Department stores in special zones and counties should pay close attention to the development of the peak season market and changes in sales. The parts that were originally insufficient in purchase should be required to be supplemented by the procurement and supply station immediately, and at the same time, it is also necessary to avoid blindly asking for things without detailed calculation. The provincial company should regularly strengthen the supervision and inspection of this work, and make appropriate adjustments in the province and region for unreasonable commodity placement. Industrial products suitable for rural needs should be given priority to rural areas. However, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of transporting high-end consumer goods that are not suitable for rural areas to the countryside in the past. In short, in the work of material allocation and transportation, units at all levels cannot be satisfied with the current situation and prevent the peak season market supply from being affected because the work of distributing commodities to the lower levels is not done well.
    All staff of the state-owned department store should realize that whether the sales plan of state-owned department store commodities can be completed is related to the development of industrial production this winter and next spring, to the growing needs of the vast number of people, to the state's financial income, to market stability, and to the improvement of our business management. Therefore, it is required to fully rely on the leadership of party committees and administrative departments at all levels, use the current favorable factors for completing the plan, work hard to overcome difficulties, eliminate ideological obstacles, tap potential forces, further carry out peak season sales promotion work with wholesale as the main focus, and ensure the completion of the 1955 sales task.

专栏：努力完成和超额完成一九五五年计划

    大力开展推销工作，使百货工业品下乡
    中国百货公司副经理　樊陶斋
    今年四月以来，国营百货商业部门的销售计划没有完成。全国一至八月份只完成年计划的百分之五十二，还有百分之四十八的销售任务需要在今后四个月内完成。在百货系统经营的三十二种主要商品中，今年上半年完成销售计划的只有三种，特别是胶鞋、缝纫机、钢精锅、香皂、铁壳水瓶、搪瓷面盆、自行车、电筒等，一至八月的销售量反低于去年同期的水平。这种情况，影响了对城乡人民生活资料的供应。国营百货公司的全体工作人员，必须努力改变这种状况，抓紧时机，集中一切力量，根据城市和乡村的不同需要，特别是根据广大农民的需要，大力组织供应，争取超额完成第四季度销售计划，从而保证完成全年销售任务。
    目前市场已逐步进入旺季，今年市场的特点是：农业生产在大部分地区丰收，国家收购又较集中，农村购买力将有显著提高，去年受灾较重而今年丰收的地区，购买力也将大有增长。根据我们概略的计算，今年上半年广大人民对百货的购买力仅实现了百分之三十九，下半年的购买力要比上半年增长很多。今年百货市场将出现旺季更旺的局面，我们第四季度的卖钱额的上升幅度也必然要超过往年的规律。粮食“三定”政策的贯彻，人民的食粮问题合理解决了，棉布定量供应了，日用品的需要量必然会有增加。同时，上半年国营百货系统执行了淡季储备工作，超额完成了收购计划，大部分商品库存比去年同期增长百分之二十五以上，并有百分之六十到七十的商品已下放到专区和县的百货商店以迎接旺季供应，特别是对农村市场的供应准备了比较充裕的物资力量，为开展推销工作、完成计划提供了有利的条件。
    贸易旺季开始了，有利条件具备了。可是，我们在工作上还有许多问题：首先是在部分职工和个别单位领导思想上产生、滋长着消极情绪，对今年旺季的特点估计不足，盲目喊任务大，对完成销售计划缺乏信心，许多省市上报第四季度销售计划都是偏小的；其次，批发工作开展不够快，在全系统内没有大力全面开展旺季推销工作；再次，同合作社的结合不够好，我们缺乏积极帮助合作社进货，以供应农村市场需要，因而使工业品自县商店继续下放还有许多问题，许多商品库存有货而零售商业网里没有，群众买不到，在基层市场发生了不应有的脱销现象；再次，在基层批发商店的干部配备上，很多单位还不能同当前的任务相适应。例如江苏省东台商店全年销售任务四百五十万元，经营品种四千四百九十三种，设有两个批发部，连主任只有十四人，他们要面对二十一个基层社和几百户私商小贩的批发，整天在批发部做买卖还忙不过来，不仅不能很好地去领导私商，连合作社也很少有人去联系。如果不迅速改变上述情况，不仅会严重地影响国营百货商业销售任务的完成，并将严重地影响农产品收购工作，对国家和人民都是极为不利的。
    为了加强旺季供应，保证完成和争取超额完成全年销售任务，各级国营百货公司应迅速克服一切思想障碍，立即把领导重点转移到开展大力推销工作方面来，并要掌握如下基本环节：
    第一、必须尽最大的努力来保证销售任务的完成。国营商业系统的领导人员应教育全体职工了解一九五五年是完成五年计划带关键性的一年，而第四季度在商业方面又是完成全年计划的关键。销售计划实现了，这就意味着我们通过许多组织工作把大量的工业品供应了人民群众，特别是广大农民群众的需要。有效地支持农产品的收购工作，才能回笼货币，稳定物价，扩大城乡物资交流，促进工农业生产发展，巩固工农联盟。同时我们把淡季储备的商品大量销售出去了，有利于加速资金周转，降低流转费用，完成为国家工业化积累资金的任务。所以大力开展推销工作，把工业品供应到农民手里，满足农民的需要，就成为国营百货公司当前极为重要的政治任务和经济任务。
    第二、进一步开展以批发为主的推销工作，以保证旺季供应。省（市）公司要迅速行动起来，抓紧对推销工作的领导，要及时发现问题，进行分析研究，提出切实可行的办法。二级站的库存商品，凡运销农村的，应继续不断地下放到县，同时要切实注意防止盲目性，努力避免货不对路和调运不及时的现象。如广东、山东、安徽、浙江、河南、湖南、湖北、四川、黑龙江等省公司已经由经理为首组成推销办公室，经常综合分析市场变化和业务经营情况，定期出版推销情况的通报，加强对所属基层商店的督促检查，及时帮助解决有关阻碍推销工业品的一切问题，这种做法是值得提倡的。但也有一些省市和不少的分公司一级单位，对这一工作不够重视，这就削弱了对于推销工作的领导。因此，要求所有省（市）公司和分公司应迅速成立推销办公室，加强对推销工作的领导。对基层商店的批发工作也要加强，浙江、山东、广东、湖南等省有的充实外联人员，有的召开了国营和合作社商业供应会议，百货工业品的推销工作已有进展。但也有些单位，如河北石家庄、杨柳青专区各商店，七月份大量减少外联批发人员，这是不符合加强批发工作的要求的，必须迅速改变这种做法。
    第三、目前农村市场已由供销合作社领导和安排。因此，开展以批发为主的推销工作，必须首先要使专区和县的百货商店和基层合作社业务密切衔接，迅速加强对合作社的联系和帮助，充分供应基层合作社所需的商品。今年上半年，由于合作社处理库存积压商品，曾一度减少工业品的进货。目前市场面临旺季，农村供应任务更为繁重，合作社库存少了，必然要补进群众所需的工业品。我们应检查并克服过去对合作社工作帮助不够的缺点，主动地积极地加强对基层合作社的联系，采取召开国营和合作社商业供应会议、联合举办工业品展览和分片包干、带样下乡等多种多样方式，帮助其开展对农村小商贩和货郎担的批发业务，合理地扩大经营品种，积极组织本地及附近地区的小百货货源，尽一切可能满足合作社的进货要求，以扩大百货工业品下乡范围。其次是加强对城市私营零售商和小商贩的领导，通过经销、代销的形式，广泛地积极地组织他们向国营百货公司进货，按国营零售牌价积极推销，发挥其经营积极性，为扩大商品流通服务，使市场安排同社会主义改造结合进行。
    第四、抓着主要商品及时令商品为主，用各种切实可行的办法，放手地大力推销。百货系统经营的计划商品，占销售总额百分之六十以上，上半年没有完成销售计划，因而影响整个销售任务的完成，但库存力量是充裕的，特别是胶鞋、玻璃、毛巾、袜子、搪瓷面盆、搪瓷口杯、电筒、香皂、牙膏、竹子和铁壳水瓶、缝纫机、收音机、自行车等销售情况更差，糖也没有完成销售计划，所以对各项商品应采取切实有效的推销措施，要做到批发商店仓库有的商品，在国营零售商店、合作社零售商店、私营零售商店里能分别陈列出来，并对最近分批降低出售牌价的商品加强宣传，放手出售。至于毛线、呢绒、卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤、棉毛袜等秋冬商品将逐渐畅销，各省市对这些商品的货源和摆布，应作一次检查，争取在季节终了前在批发环节基本卖光，不能因当季销售一旺或货源稍少而有任何保守惜售的想法和作法。
    第五、及时做好调拨运输和商品调剂，对支持旺季大力推销有极大关系。中央采购供应站、二级站应按照合同迅速及时地做好调运工作，并应抽调专职人员分别到二级站、三级商店进行推销访问，除了把库存商品介绍给销售单位并帮助他们补充适销商品做好销售工作外，同时还要虚心地倾听和搜集各级单位及消费者对所经营商品质量、品种、花色、规格、价格方面的反映和要求，认真加以研究，以改进今后指导生产和组织采购供应的工作。专区和县的百货商店应密切注意旺季市场的发展及销售情况的变化，原来进货不足的部分应即要求采购供应站补充，同时也要避免不经详细算账而盲目乱要。省公司要经常加强这一工作的督促检查，对商品摆布得不合理的，要在省、区范围内进行适当调剂，凡适合农村需要的工业品应优先供应农村。但必须坚决消除过去把不适销农村的高级消费品运到农村的现象。总之，在物资调拨运输工作上各级单位不能满足于现有情况，防止因为商品下放工作做不好而影响旺季市场的供应。
    国营百货公司的全体工作人员应该认识到国营百货商品销售计划能否完成关系到今冬、明春工业生产的发展，关系到广大人民日益增长的需要，关系到国家财政收入，关系市场稳定和我们经营管理的改善。因此，要求充分依靠各级党委和行政部门的领导，利用目前完成计划的有利因素，努力克服困难，扫除思想障碍，挖掘潜在力量，进一步开展以批发为主的旺季推销工作，保证完成一九五五年的销售任务。
