Pay Attention to Overcoming Complacency in Industrial and Mining Enterprises
	Pang Jiyun

The socialist revolution is aimed at eliminating the system of exploitation and the exploiting classes. Our industrial construction is the most important material foundation for eliminating the system of exploitation and the exploiting classes. Therefore, every new achievement in our industrial construction is a new victory we have won in the class struggle. Every newly built factory is an important fortress we have occupied on the road to our socialist goals. Every time we complete an annual or quarterly plan, every time we successfully trial-produce a new product, every successful invention and creation represents the growth of socialist strength and a serious blow to class enemies. Since this is the case, the enemy naturally understands that to sabotage our socialist construction, they must concentrate their efforts on sabotaging our industrial construction, and treat our factories, mines, transportation and basic construction departments as the main targets for their sabotage activities. Li Yingchi, a counter-revolutionary element in the Hunan Xiangsha First Factory, once said, "If I set a fire in China, I can increase the strength of the United States by one point." This counter-revolutionary element did indeed set a fire on the evening of April 29, 1954, attempting to burn down nineteen newly arrived automatic looms. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished in time and no disaster was caused.

The class struggle consciousness of the counter-revolutionary elements is so strong and clear. They regard sabotaging our industrial construction as strengthening the enemy's forces. The development of the national construction and the improvement of the people's living standards urgently require the production of a large number of new products; the counter-revolutionary elements lurking inside enterprises adopt various malicious means to deliberately delay the production of new products. The workers and staff in factories and mines cherish our machinery and equipment as they cherish their own eyes; counter-revolutionary elements, however, create a large number of accidents to sabotage our machinery and equipment. Without correct survey data, it is impossible to carry out correct design; without correct design, construction is impossible. In order to hinder the completion of our new factories and mines, counter-revolutionary elements deliberately provide erroneous survey data to the design departments, deliberately create errors in design, or create quality accidents during construction, causing our new factories and mines to suffer for a hundred years... These facts fully illustrate that a fierce class struggle is taking place in our industrial and mining enterprises.

However, many leading workers in industrial and mining enterprises do not regard the industrial front they lead as the main front in the current class struggle. They severely lack the concept of class struggle, believing that the enemies with guns have been defeated and the world is at peace. Seeing that there are no hostile classes in state-owned factories and mines, they believe that there is no class struggle in state-owned enterprises, and are completely unaware that the hidden enemy is a serious threat to our industrial construction. Although the hidden counter-revolutionary elements are wantonly carrying out sabotage activities, they believe that everything is fine, and that the only issue now is to concentrate on production, believing that "production is politics." Therefore, a dangerous tendency of only caring about business and not caring about politics has grown in the minds of many leading workers in enterprises. In their view, all political work and security work are insignificant and dispensable, and even believe that carrying out these tasks is adding trouble to them. It should be recognized that the production we are engaged in does indeed have significant political implications. Precisely because of this, the enemy will not allow us to carry out production quietly. Our political work and security work are not only to raise the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses, so as to smoothly complete the state plan, but also to raise everyone's political vigilance, mobilize everyone to prevent hidden enemies from sabotaging our production and construction at all times, so that we can safely complete the tasks of production and construction. If we do not "trouble" ourselves a little for these tasks now, perhaps one day, the enemy will come with a big "trouble", and the hard-earned labor of our thousands of workers will be destroyed by the enemy. Some people think that business is busy enough and they cannot spare time for politics. Today, the business of industrial and mining enterprises is indeed very heavy, and some leading workers in enterprises are still very unfamiliar with their business. It is entirely appropriate for them to study business. In modern enterprises, it is difficult to lead if one is vague about the business one leads and cannot explain it clearly. However, studying business should not exclude paying attention to politics. Some people have forgotten who is engaged in business work? What kind of business is being conducted? We are Communists or revolutionaries engaged in business work, and we are engaged in the business of socialist construction. Therefore, we cannot ignore politics when conducting business.

If we do not care about politics, we cannot do a good job in business—first of all, the counter-revolutionary elements will not let us do so. In order to do a good job in business, we must greatly improve our political vigilance and earnestly strengthen political work and security work in enterprises. At present, we should boldly mobilize the masses and thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

Caring about politics and caring about the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements is not only the business of leading workers in industrial and mining enterprises, but also the business of technical personnel, administrative management personnel and the masses of workers. In particular, technical personnel should not only work hard with the masses of workers to do a good job in production, but also actively participate in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. However, the tendency of technical personnel to bury themselves in business and ignore politics is even more serious and widespread. In addition, some people have some problems in their history, or some shortcomings in their ideological style, and therefore have many concerns and cannot actively and bravely stand up and fight against counter-revolutionary elements. The leading workers of enterprises should be particularly patient in carrying out ideological mobilization for them, because counter-revolutionary elements often use technology to cover up their sabotage activities. Without the participation of technical personnel, our struggle will encounter difficulties. We must believe that the vast majority of technical personnel and administrative management personnel at all levels are good. Even if some people have some problems in their history, as long as they have confessed frankly and are willing to serve the people, the Party and the people will trust them. As for some people who have problems with their ideological style, that is a matter within the people and does not hinder them from participating in the struggle at all.

Due to the lack of a concept of class struggle and a complacent and paralyzed mentality, a small number of leading workers in industrial and mining enterprises are not vigilant even towards the major accidents caused by the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements. They rarely consider major suspicious accidents in factories from a political perspective, do not think about whether there are bad elements carrying out sabotage, and treat them all as general production accidents. This non-political, complacent and paralyzed thinking of leading workers in industrial and mining enterprises is precisely what facilitates counter-revolutionary elements to carry out sabotage activities under the guise of production accidents. Some bad elements have caused major accidents several times in a row in factories, and have the title of public "accident kings". Such people can also be tolerated by some of our factory leaders. For example, the counter-revolutionary element Fu Bin mixed into the Hunan Dongan Pine Resin Processing Factory and has caused seven sabotage accidents since 1953. On November 4, 1954, he intentionally set a fire, but because it was extinguished in time, it did not attract the attention of the leaders and was not dealt with, so that this counter-revolutionary element set a second fire on November 7, burning the entire factory to the ground. These people are so paralyzed. Seven sabotage accidents and one arson cannot arouse their vigilance. Do they have to wait until the entire factory is burned down, until the fire burns on their own heads before they can be vigilant! On the construction site of a new factory, after the counter-revolutionary element Wen Lidong (technician) caused the first accident of sabotaging the boiler foundation, he pretended to "painfully" write several "self-criticisms", saying that he had "no experience". The leaders believed it. When the security department raised its opinion, a deputy manager also said, "We are building such a complex project for the first time. We have no experience. Even engineers can hardly avoid problems!" In this way, under the indulgence of our deputy manager's complacent and paralyzed thinking, the counter-revolutionary element Wen Lidong was able to continue to cause sabotage accidents again and again.

In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, attention must be paid to investigating accidents. Not only should the unprocessed accidents be investigated, but also the relatively major and suspicious accidents that have been processed should be re-analyzed and dealt with from the perspective of class struggle, in the context of increased vigilance. Investigating accidents can not only find out counter-revolutionary elements, but also gain experience and lessons from here, and use these specific and vivid examples to educate everyone to improve vigilance.

At present, there are many loopholes in the personnel system, confidentiality system and security work in industrial and mining enterprises, which provide great convenience for counter-revolutionary elements. The personnel system of many industrial and mining enterprises is not strict, and the staff is not strictly screened. The enemy took advantage of this loophole and was able to mix into industrial and mining enterprises. Some enterprises accepted the messy situation left over from the enemy and puppet era, and did not clean up the original personnel, making it difficult to distinguish between the good and the bad. Later, with the development of production, they recruited production and technical personnel everywhere, and some counter-revolutionary elements disguised themselves as technical personnel and took the opportunity to sneak in. Private introductions also gave counter-revolutionary elements an opportunity to take advantage of.

Many leaders of industrial and mining enterprises do not pay attention to the work of understanding people, forgetting that they are not only the commanders of the production process, but also the commanders and educators of their staff. They only have contact with their staff in terms of business work, and never care about the ideological dynamics of these people, abandoning the responsibility of educating these people. They do not inquire about the origins of their staff, do not probe everyone's background, and easily believe in people. When employing people, they only pay attention to so-called talents and technical standards, but not to political qualities. They believe that as long as they have technology to work in the enterprise, political qualities do not need to be considered. Some leaders of industrial and mining enterprises even know that someone is a counter-revolutionary element but still use him, because he understands technology and is afraid that leaving him will affect production. This is a suicidal approach of "drinking poison to quench thirst" and "nurturing a tumor for future trouble." Counter-revolutionary elements who "understand" technology will not serve us, but can only use technology to sabotage us.

In many industrial and mining enterprises, secrets are not well protected. They do not pay attention to reviewing personnel who manage secrets and key departments, the storage and borrowing system of drawings and other confidential materials is not strict, and they neglect to educate all employees on confidentiality. Therefore, the phenomenon of leaking secrets and losing drawings is very common. According to the inspection of four key engineering units in Jilin Province, 75 top-secret drawings and materials were lost in the past year. However, the leading workers in the enterprise do not care about these phenomena. Some responsible staff in industrial and mining enterprises themselves like to brag and love to spread rumors, so that they casually publicize important state secrets. The leading workers in industrial and mining enterprises should earnestly change this situation, strictly implement the storage system for confidential materials and drawings, and always pay attention to conducting confidentiality education for all employees.

If the security work of industrial and mining enterprises is not sound, it cannot form an important force to combat the enemy. A small number of factory administrative leaders and even Party organizations believe that security work is only the work of special departments and do not provide guidance. The Party committee does not regularly study the work of the security department. Therefore, security work in industrial and mining enterprises is often in a situation where no one cares about it, only a few people carry it out, and the broad masses do not cooperate. Some even believe that security work is not important in industrial and mining enterprises and can be cancelled. They said: "The counter-revolution has been suppressed, and there are no counter-revolutionary elements in the factory. Even if there are individual counter-revolutionary elements left, let the Party and the League take care of them. The security personnel should also go to engage in technology." It can be seen how much some people lack the concept of enemy intelligence. Our security work is a sharp sword aimed at the heart of the counter-revolutionary elements. When the class struggle still exists, how can we put down this important weapon?

The complacent and paralyzed thinking of the leading workers in industrial and mining enterprises, whether you like it or not, is actually indulging counter-revolutionary elements in carrying out sabotage activities, and is a crime against the people. Party organizations at all levels should continuously educate the leading workers in industrial and mining enterprises with the spirit of improving revolutionary vigilance, oppose their complacent and paralyzed thinking caused by only seeing the achievements of economic work or only caring about business, resolutely eliminate the hidden counter-revolutionary elements in industrial and mining enterprises, and ensure that we can safely carry out socialist construction.

    在工矿企业中注意克服麻痹思想
    庞季云
    社会主义革命是要消灭剥削制度和剥削阶级，我们的工业建设，正是我们消灭剥削制度和消灭剥削阶级的最重要的物质基础。因此，我们在工业建设上的每一个新的成就，都是我们在阶级斗争中取得的新胜利。我们每一个新建成的工厂，都是我们向社会主义目标前进的道路上所占领的重要堡垒，我们每完成一个年度、季度的计划，每试制成功一种新产品，每一种发明创造的成功，都是社会主义力量的增长，都是对阶级敌人的严重打击。既然如此，敌人当然懂得，要破坏我们的社会主义建设事业，就一定要集中力量破坏我们的工业建设，把我们的工厂、矿山、交通运输和基本建设部门，当作他们进行破坏活动的主要目标。湖南湘纱一厂反革命分子李应池就曾经这样说：“我在中国放一把火，就可以增加美国一分力量。”这个反革命分子果然在一九五四年四月二十九日晚上放了一把火，企图烧毁新运到的十九台自动织布机，幸而及时扑救，没有造成灾害。
    反革命分子的阶级斗争观念是这样的强烈鲜明，他们是把对我们的工业建设的破坏，看成是增强敌人的力量的。国家建设事业的发展和人民生活水平的提高，迫切需要生产大量的新产品；钻在企业内部的反革命分子就采取各种恶毒的手段，故意延缓新产品的生产。厂矿企业中的职工群众像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护我们的机器设备；反革命分子却大量地制造事故，破坏我们的机器设备。没有正确的勘察资料，就不可能进行正确的设计，没有正确的设计，就不可能施工；反革命分子为了阻碍我们新厂矿的建成，就故意把错误的勘察资料提供给设计部门，故意在设计中弄出差错，或者在施工中制造质量事故，使我们的新建厂矿百年受害，……这些事实充分说明，在我们的工矿企业中正在激烈地进行着阶级斗争。
    但是，有许多工矿企业的领导工作人员却没有把他们所领导的工业战线看做当前阶级斗争的主要战线。他们十分缺乏阶级斗争的观点，以为拿枪的敌人已被打倒，天下就已经太平；看到国营厂矿中没有敌对的阶级，就以为国营企业中没有阶级斗争，根本感觉不到隐蔽的敌人对于我们的工业建设是一个严重的威胁。尽管暗藏的反革命分子在放肆地进行破坏活动，他们却以为一切都不成问题了，现在的问题只是埋头进行生产，认为“生产就是政治”。因此，在不少企业领导工作人员中就滋长了一种只顾业务不问政治的危险倾向。在他们看来，一切政治工作、保卫工作都是微不足道的可有可无的事情，甚至认为进行这些工作是给他们添麻烦。应该认识到，我们所进行的生产确实是有重大的政治意义的。正因为如此，敌人就不会让我们安安静静地进行生产。我们进行政治工作和保卫工作，不但是要提高群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性，以便顺利地完成国家计划，而且要提高大家的政治警惕性，动员大家时刻防止暗藏的敌人破坏我们的生产建设，使我们能够安全地完成生产建设任务。现在如果不为这些工作稍稍“麻烦”一下，说不定那一天，敌人就会来个大大的“麻烦”，我们千百个工人群众的辛苦的劳动成果，一下就会毁于敌人之手。有些人认为业务已经够忙了，顾不上再搞政治。今天工矿企业的业务的确是很烦重，而且有些企业的领导工作人员对业务还是很生疏的，他们钻研业务完全是应当的。在近代企业中，对于自己所领导的业务含含糊糊，说不出个究竟来，就很难进行领导。但是钻研业务，不应排斥过问政治。有些人忘记了是什么人在进行业务工作？是进行什么业务？我们是共产党员或革命者在进行业务工作，我们是进行社会主义建设的业务。因此，我们进行业务，不能不问政治。
    不问政治，就不能搞好业务——首先，反革命分子就不让我们这样做。为了搞好业务，就必须大大地提高我们的政治警惕性，切实地加强企业中的政治工作和保卫工作。在目前，就应该放手发动群众，彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    关心政治，关心同反革命分子进行斗争，不仅是工矿企业领导工作人员的事，也是技术人员、行政管理人员和工人群众的事。特别是技术人员，他们不仅应该同工人群众在一起努力搞好生产，而且应该积极地参加肃清反革命分子的斗争。但是，在技术人员中，埋头业务不问政治的倾向是更为严重更为普遍的。加上有些人历史上有些问题，或者是思想作风上有些缺点，因而顾虑较多，不能积极地勇敢地挺身出来，同反革命分子进行斗争。企业的领导工作人员应该特别耐心地对他们进行思想发动，因为反革命分子常常是利用技术来掩盖他们的破坏活动的，如果没有技术人员参加，我们的斗争就会遇到困难。我们要相信绝大多数的技术人员和各级行政管理人员都是好的，有些人虽然历史上有些问题，只要他们已经坦白交代，愿意为人民服务，党和人民就会相信他们；至于有些人思想作风有毛病，那是人民内部的事情，丝毫也不妨碍他们参加斗争。
    少数工矿企业的领导工作人员由于缺乏阶级斗争的观念和有太平麻痹的情绪，因而对于反革命分子的破坏活动所造成的重大事故也不加警惕。他们对于工厂发生的重大的可疑的事故，很少从政治上加以考虑，不想一想会不会有坏分子进行破坏，一概当做一般的生产事故去处理。工矿企业领导工作人员的这种非政治的太平麻痹思想，正是便于反革命分子在生产事故的掩盖下进行破坏活动。有的坏分子在工厂一连几次造成重大事故，有公开的“事故大王”的称号，这种人也能得到我们一些工厂领导工作人员的容忍。例如反革命分子傅斌混入湖南东安松脂加工厂，自一九五三年以来先后制造破坏事故七起，并且在一九五四年十一月四日有意纵火一次，因为及时扑灭了，就没有引起领导人注意处理，以致这个反革命分子在十一月七日第二次纵火，全厂付之一炬。这些人竟然麻痹到了这种程度，难道七次制造破坏事故，一次纵火还不能引起他们的警惕，非等把整个工厂烧了，非要火烧到他们自己的头上才能引起他们的警惕！在一个新建工厂的工地上，反革命分子文立冬（技术员）第一次制造破坏锅炉基础的事故后，假装“痛心地”写了几次“检讨”书，说是“没有经验”，领导人员也就信了。保卫部门提出意见，一位副经理还说：“我们头一次修建这样复杂的工程，没有经验，就是工程师也难免发生问题呀！”就这样，在我们这位副经理的太平麻痹思想的纵容下，反革命分子文立冬得以一再地继续制造破坏的事故。
    在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，必须注意清查事故。不仅对于没有处理的事故要加以清查，就是对于已经处理的比较重大而可疑的事故，也应在提高警惕性的情况下，用阶级斗争的观点重新加以分析和处理。清查事故不仅可以清查出反革命分子来，而且还可以从这里取得经验教训，用这些具体生动的事例来对大家进行提高警惕性的教育。
    目前工矿企业的人事制度、保密制度和保卫工作方面的漏洞很多，给反革命分子大开方便之门。许多工矿企业的人事制度不严，对工作人员不加严格审查，敌人钻了这种空子，得以混入工矿企业中来。有些企业接受了敌伪时代留下来的乱摊子，对于原有人员不加清理，使好的和坏的混杂在一起，不便分辨。以后生产发展，又到处招聘生产技术人员，有些反革命分子就冒充技术人员，乘机钻了进来。还有私人介绍，也给了反革命分子以可乘之机。
    不少工矿企业的领导者不注意做了解人的工作，忘记了他们不仅是生产过程的指挥者，而且也是他们所属人员的统帅和教育者。他们同工作人员只有业务工作上的接触，从来不关心这些人的思想动态，放弃了对这些人进行教育的责任。他们对于所属人员不打听一下每个人的来历，不摸摸各个人的底，就轻易地相信了人。他们用人只注意所谓的才能和技术标准，而不注意政治品质，认为在企业中工作只要有技术就行，政治品质是不需要考虑的。有的工矿企业的领导者甚至明明知道某人是反革命分子也要用，理由是他懂技术，怕离开他影响生产。这是一种“饮鸩止渴”、“养痈贻患”的自杀做法。反革命分子“懂”技术，是不会为我们服务的，他只能利用技术对我们进行破坏。
    在许多工矿企业里，对机密保护得很不好。他们不注意审查掌管机密和要害部门的人员，图纸和其他机密资料的保管和借阅制度不严格，忽视对全体职工进行保密的教育。因此，泄漏机密和丢失图纸的现象很普遍，据吉林省四个重点工程单位检查，去年一年中就遗失绝密图纸、资料七十五份。而企业中的领导工作人员对这些现象却不以为意。有些工矿企业的负责工作人员本身就好吹牛，爱小广播，以致随便把国家的重要机密宣扬出去。工矿企业中的领导工作人员应该认真地改变这种情况，严格机密资料图纸的保管制度，并经常注意对全体职工进行保密教育。
    工矿企业的保卫工作不健全，就不能形成打击敌人的重要力量。少数工厂行政领导人甚至党组织都认为保卫工作只是特殊部门的工作而不加以指导，党委也不定期研究保卫部门的工作。因此，保卫工作在工矿企业中经常处于无人过问、只是少数人进行而得不到广大群众配合的情况。甚至有的认为保卫工作在工矿企业中并不重要，可以取消。他们说：“反革命已经镇压过了，工厂没有反革命分子了，即使剩下个别的反革命分子，就交给党、团去搞吧，保卫人员也应该去搞技术。”可以看出，有些人是多么缺乏敌情观念。我们的保卫工作是对准反革命分子心房的一把锋利的宝剑，当阶级斗争仍然存在的时候，我们怎能放下这个重要的武器呢？
    工矿企业的领导工作人员有太平麻痹思想，不管你愿意不愿意，实际上就是纵容反革命分子进行破坏活动，就是对人民的犯罪。各级党组织应该不断地以提高革命警惕性的精神来教育工矿企业的领导工作人员，反对他们由于只看见经济工作的成绩或者是只顾业务而产生的太平麻痹思想，坚决肃清工矿企业中暗藏的反革命分子，保证我们安全地进行社会主义建设。
