Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th (TASS): Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov issued a statement regarding the US organization of releasing balloons from West Germany, endangering aviation safety.

The statement said: Soviet pilots flying on domestic and international routes have reported seeing uncontrolled balloons carrying objects floating in the air. It is known that these balloons were released from West German territory for the purpose of distributing leaflets and propaganda hostile to the Soviet Union and several other European countries.

The statement pointed out that these balloons, flying at different times, different altitudes, and in different directions, endangered the lives and safety of passengers and crew members flying on Soviet domestic and international routes.

The statement further pointed out that these balloons were released by US organizations from West German territory. The American broadcasting station in Munich explicitly stated on August 16th that the American "Crusade for Freedom" organization had released many such balloons on August 15th.

The Soviet government urges the West German Chancellor to pay attention to the above situation and hopes that the Federal Republic of Germany will take necessary measures to stop the aforementioned actions and eliminate the threat posed by these balloons to aircraft flying on domestic routes in the Soviet Union and on international routes crossing the territories of the Soviet Union and several European countries.

    就美国组织从西德放出气球危及航空安全一事
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫发表声明
    新华社十四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联外交部长莫洛托夫就美国组织从西德放出气球危及航空安全一事发表声明。
    声明说：在国内和国际航线上飞行的苏联驾驶员报告，他们看见一些携带物件的大气球未经控制地在空中飘行。大家知道，这些气球是从西德领土上放出，为了在苏联和若干其他欧洲国家散发敌视这些国家的传单和宣传品的。
    声明指出，这些气球在不同的时间，不同的高度和向不同的方向飞行，危及了在苏联国内和国际航线上飞行的旅客和机上人员的生命安全。
    声明又指出，这些气球是美国组织从西德领土上放出的。慕尼黑的美国广播站八月十六日已经直言不讳地说过：美国“争取自由十字军”组织在八月十五日就曾放出许多这样的气球。
    苏联政府促请西德总理注意上述情况，希望德意志联邦共和国采取必要的措施制止上述行动，消除这些气球对在苏联国内航线以及越过苏联和若干欧洲国家的领土的国际航线上飞行的飞机所造成的威胁。
