    Oppose the Bad Practice of Randomly Giving Gifts
    To the Editor:
    The Meihekou Purchasing and Supply Station of the Jilin Provincial Company of China National Merchandise Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the Supply Station) received a large number of gifts last year, including cheval mirrors, basketballs, calendars, and pictures. The Supply Station distributed these gifts to all twenty-odd offices in the station. For example, each office had at least one mirror, and some had two. There were at least two calendars, and some had four; even then, they couldn't use them all, so the employees took them home to use or gave them to others.
    Who is so generous as to send gifts to the Supply Station? The units that sent gifts include the Jilin Provincial Daily Chemical Factory, the Local State-Owned Andong Stationery Factory, the Anshan Printing Factory, the Dalian Oils and Fats Chemical Factory, the Shenyang XinSheng Factory, the Bicycle Factory, and the Andong City First District Mirror Industry Cooperative. The purpose of these units in sending gifts is probably to improve relations with commercial departments in order to better promote their factory's products. Obviously, this vulgar practice is a manifestation of capitalist business ideology and is incompatible with the business methods that state enterprises should have. This practice does not help expand product sales, but also creates unnecessary waste and increases product costs. All enterprise departments should correct this practice.

### 反对乱送礼物的恶劣风气

    反对乱送礼物的恶劣风气编辑同志：
    中国百货公司吉林省公司梅河口采购供应站（以下简称供应站）在去年收到大批礼物，其中有穿衣镜、篮球、日历、画片等。供应站把这些礼物都分配给全站二十多个办公室了。例如镜子每个办公室至少有一面，多的有两面。日历少的有两份，多的有四份；就这样还用不完，职工们就拿回家去用或者再送给别人。
    是谁这样慷慨地向供应站送礼呢？送礼的单位有吉林省日用化学工厂、地方国营安东文具厂、鞍山印刷厂、大连油脂化学工厂、沈阳新生工厂、自行车工厂、安东市一区镜业合作社等。这些单位送礼的目的，大概是为了要搞好同商业部门的关系，以便更好地推销本厂的产品。很显然，这种庸俗的做法，是资本主义经营思想的表现，同国家企业机关应有的经营方法是不相容的。这种做法，对扩大产品销路没有什么好处，还造成了不应有的浪费，加大了产品的成本。各地企业部门都应该纠正这种做法。
