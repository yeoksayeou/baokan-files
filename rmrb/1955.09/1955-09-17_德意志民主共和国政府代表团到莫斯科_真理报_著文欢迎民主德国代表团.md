Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: According to TASS Moscow: The delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic arrived in Moscow on the 16th. The members of the delegation include: Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl; Deputy Prime Ministers Ulbricht, Stoph, Nuschke; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Bolz, etc.

The purpose of the delegation's arrival in the Soviet capital is to continue the talks between the governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, which began during the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Berlin this summer. The talks involve further measures to develop and consolidate friendly relations between the two countries, as well as other issues of mutual concern.

Greeting the delegation of the German Democratic Republic at the airport were: Kaganovich, Malenkov, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Suslov, Khrushchev, ministers of various Soviet ministries, and envoys from many countries stationed in Moscow.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to TASS Moscow: "Pravda" published an article on the 16th regarding the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic arriving in Moscow to continue negotiations with the Soviet government.

The article stated: The Soviet people warmly welcome the arrival of the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic. They harbor deep sympathy and friendly feelings for the German Democratic Republic—the reliable bastion of the peace-loving democratic forces of the German people.

The article pointed out: The German Democratic Republic is a state of the working class and working farmers. It also pointed out the great achievements it has made in politics and economics since its establishment six years ago.

The article then stated: From the very first day of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union has established good friendly relations with it. At present, the governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic hold completely identical views on the issue of the international situation and on strengthening and expanding political, economic, and cultural cooperation in the future. There is no doubt that the visit of the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic to Moscow and the upcoming consultations will help develop this mutually beneficial cooperation.

The article then pointed out: The German Democratic Republic is an independent country recognized by many European countries and the two major powers of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Although capitalist countries are currently unwilling to recognize the German Democratic Republic, the German Democratic Republic exists. It represents the peaceful forces of the German people, and when deciding the future fate of Germany, the opinions of these peaceful forces cannot be ignored. The opinion of the German Democratic Republic should be taken into consideration, just as the opinion of the Federal Republic of Germany should be taken into consideration.

The article concluded: The Soviet people wholeheartedly wish the German Democratic Republic further consolidation and prosperity. The Soviet people have no doubt that the friendly relations between our two countries will be further developed in the future on the basis of complete equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
