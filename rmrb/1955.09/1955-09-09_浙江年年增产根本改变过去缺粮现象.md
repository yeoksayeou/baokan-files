    (Report from our Hangzhou Office, August 8th) Zhejiang Province's grain production has increased year by year since liberation, transforming it from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province.
    Zhejiang Province has always been known as the "land of fish and rice" in Jiangnan. Before liberation, the vast number of farmers in this "land of fish and rice" lived a life of "half a year of bran and vegetables." The entire province was short of grain every year and relied on grain transported from other places. Many urban residents ate Jiangxi rice, Shanghai noodles, and foreign rice and noodles. According to customs records, as many as 2.36 million shi of foreign rice were imported into Ningbo alone in 1920.
    Since liberation, the Party organizations and the People's Government of Zhejiang Province have led the peasants in production, resulting in a year-by-year increase in grain production. Taking the total grain output in 1949 as 100, it was 120 in 1950, 145.5 in 1951, 163 in 1952, and although there were droughts and floods in 1953 and 1954, grain production remained stable at the 1952 level. Grain supply has been tending towards balance since 1950, reversing the phenomenon of relying on grain imports from other provinces. After the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in 1953, the free grain market was eliminated, grain speculation was curbed, and Zhejiang Province saved a large amount of grain to support other regions. Statistics show that from July 1953 to June 1955, over 1.8 billion jin of grain was transferred out in two years, powerfully supporting national industrial construction.
    Zhejiang Province's grain production achievements are inseparable from the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation and the state's economic support. This year, more than 90 percent of the agricultural producers' cooperatives have achieved bumper harvests of summer crops. Among the 920-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives in Huangyan County, 470 cooperatives increased early rice production by 10 to 20 percent, and about 200 cooperatives increased production by 30 percent. At the same time, the state's total investment in farmland water conservancy in Zhejiang Province from 1950 to 1954 reached 24.76 million yuan, and agricultural loans of 114.449 million yuan were issued.

### 浙江年年增产根本改变过去缺粮现象

    浙江年年增产根本改变过去缺粮现象
    本报杭州八日电  浙江省解放几年来粮食产量逐年增加，由过去的缺粮省变为余粮省。
    浙江省素来被称为江南“鱼米之乡”，解放前这个“鱼米之乡”的广大农民却过着“糠菜半年粮”的生活，全省年年缺粮，年年依赖外地运来粮食。不少市镇居民吃的是江西米、上海面和洋米、洋面。据海关登记资料：一九二零年在宁波一个港口输入的洋米达二百三十六万石。
    解放以来，浙江省的党组织和人民政府领导农民生产，使粮食产量逐年提高。以一九四九年粮食总产量为一百，则一九五零年为一百二十，一九五一年为一百四十五点五，一九五二年为一百六十三，一九五三年和一九五四年虽遭受旱灾水灾，粮食产量仍稳定在一九五二年的水平。粮食供应从一九五零年起即趋于平衡，扭转了依靠省外粮食输入的现象。一九五三年国家实行粮食统购统销政策以后，消灭了粮食自由市场，遏止了粮食投机现象，浙江省节余了大量粮食支援外地。统计从一九五三年七月至一九五五年六月，两年中调出粮食在十八亿斤以上，有力地支援了国家工业建设。
    浙江省粮食增产成就是和农业互助合作的发展、国家经济上的支援不可分的。今年百分之九十以上的农业生产合作社夏收作物都获得丰收。黄岩县九百二十多个农业生产合作社中，早稻增产一成至二成的有四百七十个社，增产三成的有二百个社左右。同时国家从一九五零年至一九五四年的五年中在浙江省农田水利方面的投资总额达二千四百七十六万元，发放农贷一亿一千四百四十九万元。
