Fushun Local Industrial Departments Conserve Coal

    The experience of the Fushun Municipal Local State-owned Paper Mill in using coal slurry to replace raw coal for boiler firing has been promoted in Fushun Municipal Local State-owned Rubber, Food, Oil, and Pharmaceutical factories since July 22nd. Using coal slurry, which costs less than 8 yuan per ton, can replace raw coal, which costs more than 17 yuan, with good results. After a certain burning time, the coal slurry melts into crystalline lumps, which can be broken into burning coal pieces with an iron hook. Except for needing to clean the furnace a few more times, the burning process is exactly the same as with raw coal.

    The Fushun Municipal Local State-owned Wood Factory uses sawdust to burn heating boilers, saving a lot of coal. Some factories have also promoted the advanced operating method of "sprinkling water to aid combustion" for production boilers, with general coal saving rates of around 10%. Wang Jiugong, an old boiler operator at the Fushun Municipal Local State-owned Brewery, also recycles the waste steam water for combustion assistance, increasing the coal saving rate from 10% to 22%.

    抚顺地方工业部门节约用煤
    抚顺市地方国营造纸厂用煤泥代替原煤烧锅炉的经验，从七月二十二日起，已分别在抚顺市地方国营橡胶、食品、制油、制药等厂推广。用每吨价值不到八元的煤泥可代替价值十七元多的原煤，效果很好。煤泥经过一定燃烧时间以后便熔结成结晶形块，用铁钩敲碎就成为熊熊燃烧着的煤块，除需要多清几遍炉外，在燃烧过程中和原煤完全相同。
    抚顺市地方国营木器厂用锯屑烧取暖锅炉，节省了许多用煤。有些工厂生产用锅炉还推广了“撒水助燃”的先进操作方法，一般省煤率都在百分之十左右。抚顺市地方国营酿造厂的老司炉工人王久功又把跑掉的乏气水回收做助燃用，使省煤率由百分之十提高到百分之二十二。　（吴龙贵）
