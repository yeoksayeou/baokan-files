Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 20th (Tass dispatch): The following is Grotewohl's speech on September 19, 1955, at the negotiation between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic:

    Please allow me to say a few final words. Comrade Bulganin told us that the Soviet government has ordered the abolition of the High Commissioner's Office and the annulment of various decisions of the former Control Commission. Regarding the legal issues promulgated by the Control Commission, Comrade Walter Ulbricht has already pointed out on our behalf today that, due to the general trend of the situation, we can no longer recognize the laws promulgated by the Control Commission. Therefore, our intention is consistent with the decision of the Soviet government. However, we not only consider this a formal action to simplify many measures, but we also believe that your decision expresses confidence in the legislative body of the German Democratic Republic, trusting that they are capable of handling the affairs of their country without the Control Commission.

    Comrade Bulganin rightly pointed out that our nearly concluded negotiations are of great historical significance. Comrade Khrushchev also elaborated on this idea here. We fully agree with this view. I believe that the treaty we are about to conclude here, once implemented, will make it possible to expand the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany from the German Democratic Republic to the entire Germany. This is one of the political tasks of decisive significance for our future development.

    We also believe that now it is not only a matter of strengthening our friendship, but also of finally ending the past unpleasant relations between our two peoples with this treaty. We believe that two principles are the foundation of our new friendly relations.

    Both of our peoples are striving to realize social relations that require huge and broad opportunities in economic, political, and cultural aspects. Therefore, our relationship must have long-term prospects. Therefore, we hope that our friendly relations will be established forever and be unbreakable. On this basis, it is possible to achieve the great humanitarian goals that socialism strives to achieve.

    I would like to briefly talk about what Comrade Khrushchev said. First of all, we are very grateful for Comrade Khrushchev's words about all the progressive forces in Germany. We feel the same way. We started our work as an anti-fascist movement. With the cooperation of all progressive forces, we have long surpassed this stage in our development process. Since we have defined the task of establishing a socialist foundation in the German Democratic Republic for ourselves, we and all our friends have reached a consensus on this basis and have become close comrades.

    If I assure you that we will not deviate from this victorious path, I am certainly expressing the opinion of all my friends. Comrade Khrushchev spoke in very warm words about the Soviet people's confidence in the German nation, in the working people of the German Democratic Republic, and in the working class of the entire Germany. He spoke about confidence in the working peasants and progressive intellectuals.

    Dear friends, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks for this evaluation of our work. Although we try to be careful not to be complacent, this evaluation of our work and our people still inspires us in our work.

    Finally, I would like to talk about your, Comrade Khrushchev's, talk about the former prisoners of war who are serving sentences for their crimes. I just want to talk about this issue briefly. The reason I am mentioning this issue is only because the bourgeois newspapers' mention of the issue of people sentenced for war crimes has never been the topic of our negotiations. Why haven't we discussed this issue? Because we have already reached a complete agreement on this issue in Berlin. We do not regard this issue as a political issue, and we also estimate this issue from a humanitarian point of view. Regarding this, you, Comrade Khrushchev, have already talked about it in detail here.

    I would like to finally illustrate the following point. Our talks have shown that the strengthening and expansion of our friendly relations are of great significance for the future, because this relationship is in the interests of the peoples of our two countries and the peoples of Europe. One of the best and most sincere friends of the Soviet Union in the entire Germany is our country's president, Wilhelm Pieck. Comrade Wilhelm Pieck said last year: "We must make the cause of Soviet-German friendship a personal cause of the German people." Please allow me to assure you that we will work according to this statement to make our friendly relations a personal cause of the German people.

### 在苏联和民主德国十九日谈判会议上  格罗提渥的发言

    在苏联和民主德国十九日谈判会议上
    格罗提渥的发言
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：以下是格罗提渥一九五五年九月十九日在苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团谈判时的发言：
    请容许我最后讲几句话。布尔加宁同志向我们说，苏联政府已经下令撤销高级专员公署和废除前管制委员会的各种决定。关于管制委员会所颁布的法律问题，瓦尔特·乌布利希同志今天已经代表我们指出：由于局势的总趋势，我们已经不能再承认管制委员会所颁布的法律了。因此，我们的意愿是同苏联政府的决定相符的。不过，我们不仅认为这是使许多措施简化的一种形式上的行动，我们同时也认为你们的决定是表示信任德意志民主共和国的立法机构，信任它们有能力不用管制委员会而自行处理它们国家的事务。
    布尔加宁同志很正确地指出：我们的将近结束的谈判是有着重大的历史意义的。赫鲁晓夫同志也在这里发挥了这种想法。我们完全同意这种看法。我相信：我们要在这里缔结的条约在实施后会使苏联和德国的友好关系有可能从德意志民主共和国扩大到整个德国。这是对我们未来的发展具有决定意义的政治任务之一。
    我们还认为，现在不仅是加强我们的友谊的问题，而且是用这个条约最后结束我们两国人民过去不好的关系的问题。我们认为两项原则是我们新的友好关系的基础。
    我们两国人民都在争取实现在经济、政治和文化方面需要有巨大和广阔的机会的社会关系。所以，我们的关系必须具有长远的前景。因此，我们希望我们的友好关系永远地建立起来，而且是牢不可破的。在这个基础上，就有可能达到社会主义所力求实现的伟大的人道主义目标。
    我想就赫鲁晓夫同志所讲的话简单谈几句话。首先，我们很感激赫鲁晓夫同志所讲的关于德国一切进步力量的话。我们也有同感。我们是作为一个反法西斯运动开始我们的工作的。在一切进步力量的合作下，我们老早就超过了我们发展过程中的这个阶段。自从我们为我们自己规定了在德意志民主共和国建立社会主义基础的任务以来，我们同我们一切的朋友已经在这个基础上取得了一致意见，并且成了亲密的同志。
    如果我向你们保证说，我们不会脱离这条胜利的道路，我肯定是表达了我所有的朋友的意见。赫鲁晓夫同志用非常热烈的言词谈到苏联人民对德意志国家的信心，对德意志民主共和国劳动人民和全德国工人阶级的信心，他谈到对劳动农民和进步知识分子的信心。
    亲爱的朋友们，请允许我衷心感谢你们对我们工作的这种评价。虽然我们竭力当心不要自满，但是对我们的工作和我们的人民的这种评价仍然使我们在工作中感到鼓舞。
    最后，我要就你，赫鲁晓夫同志关于正在为他们的罪行服刑的前战俘问题的谈话讲几句话。我只想简单地谈一谈这个问题。而我之所以要提到这个问题，只是因为资产阶级报纸提到因战争罪行而被判刑的人的问题一直不是我们的谈判讨论的题目。我们为什么没有讨论这个问题呢？因为我们在柏林已经就这个问题达成完全的协议。我们并不把这个问题看成是政治问题，我们也是从人道的观点来估计这个问题的。关于这一点，你，赫鲁晓夫同志，已经在这里详细谈到了。
    我最后想说明下面这一点。我们的会谈已经表明我们的友好关系的加强和扩大对于未来具有重大的意义，因为这种关系是符合我们两国人民和欧洲各国人民的利益的。苏联在全德国最好的、最真诚的朋友之一是我们国家的总统威廉·皮克。威廉·皮克同志在去年说：“我们必须使苏、德友好的事业成为德国人民的切身事业。”请让我向你们保证：我们将根据这段声明进行工作，使我们的友好关系成为德国人民的切身事业。
