Guangdong Province is organizing and identifying rice varieties.

The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture plans to organize and identify the approximately two thousand rice varieties currently grown by farmers throughout the province within two to three years, distinguishing between superior and inferior varieties to guide farmers in seed selection. In June of this year, cadres and technicians dispatched by the Provincial Department of Agriculture conducted field surveys and indoor research on over four hundred rice varieties grown by farmers in five counties in the Pearl River Delta (Zhongshan County), eastern Guangdong (Meixian County), northern Guangdong (Qujiang County), Hainan Island (Qiongshan County), and western Guangdong (Yangjiang County). The organization and identification work was completed in August, and over sixty superior varieties were identified.

Meixian County discovered a high-yielding "Mi Zao" rice variety with many advantages such as drought resistance. The county will mobilize farmers to promote this good variety through seed selection and replacement. At the same time, it was discovered that the "Er Jiang Zao" rice variety currently grown by farmers is an inferior variety with low yield, and it is planned to gradually eliminate it. Qujiang County also discovered a "Ma Fang Xian" variety in Maba District that had never been valued before, which is a high-yielding good variety. Now, local agricultural production cooperatives have included "Ma Fang Xian" in their seed selection projects. After identifying local good varieties, Zhongshan, Qiongshan, and Yangjiang counties have also initially mobilized farmers to carry out seed selection, seed retention, and variety replacement work.

    广东省整理鉴别水稻品种
    广东省农业厅计划在两三年内，将全省农民现在所种的约二千种水稻品种加以整理鉴别，分别优劣指导农民选种。今年六月，省农业厅派出的干部和技术员，对珠江三角洲中山县、粤东梅县、粤北曲江县、海南岛琼山县和粤西阳江县等五县农民所种的四百多种水稻品种作了野外调查和室内研究，已在八月份整理鉴别完毕，共鉴别出优良品种六十多种。
    梅县这次发现了产量较高而有抗旱等许多优点的“密早”稻等良种，将发动农民经过选种换种加以推广。同时，还发现农民现在所种的一种“二江早”稻是劣种，产量不高，拟逐步加以淘汰。曲江县这次在马坝区也发现了一种从没有被人重视的“马房籼”，是产量很高的良种。现在，当地的农业生产合作社都将“马房籼”列入了选种的项目。中山、琼山、阳江三县这次也都在鉴别出当地的良种后，初步发动农民进行了选种留种和换种的工作。（新华社）
