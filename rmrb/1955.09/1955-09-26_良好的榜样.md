    Good Examples
    Zuo Ping
    On the morning of September 25th, a vibrant team of young people, carrying red flags and singing songs, marched towards a barren land in the Zizhuyuan Park in the western suburbs. The young people wore bright red silk ribbons on their chests. This was a team of over 1,500 outstanding young people attending the National Congress of Active Youth in Socialist Construction. Together with more than 300 students from the Central Communist Youth League School, they went there to participate in voluntary labor to level the parkland.
    The news of the voluntary labor received enthusiastic support from all the young activists attending the conference. They wanted to use this voluntary labor to express their enthusiasm for the socialist construction cause of the motherland; they wanted to set an example so that such voluntary labor could be widely carried out among young people across the country. Hou Yezhe, a female youth activist from Shanxi Province, was not in good health, and her comrades advised her to stay behind, but she insisted on going; Luo Muming, who was blind, also insisted on going, saying, "I can even do delicate work of manufacturing production tools, how can I not do this kind of rough work?" As soon as they arrived at the land assigned to them, these young people took off their shirts, rolled up their trouser legs, and started working with picks, rakes, and hoes.
    Hu Yaobang and other comrades from the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also personally participated in the voluntary labor.
    The young activists of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army greeted this voluntary labor with a fighting spirit. The section of wasteland assigned to them by the command was arduous, with many pits, stones, and tree roots. But what did that matter? Qin Wenxue, a first-class meritorious worker in the construction of the Kangzang Highway, took the lead in filling the pits, removing large stones, and opening up a new road with other comrades. Yuan Yingzhong, an ambush hero on the border line, turned up the soil more than 20 centimeters deep with each hoe, and sweat dripped from his face into the soil, but he ignored it.
    The female youth activists also achieved excellent results in their labor. Wu Xiuzhen is the deputy leader of the production team of the Beijing Horticulture Agricultural Production Cooperative. She works neatly and nimbly, and some male comrades are not as good as her; Feng Jian, a seventeen-year-old female youth activist from Hunan Province, walked barefoot, carrying weeds and walking like the wind.
    The labor started at 7:40, and in just one hour, the team of young activists from Beijing was the first to complete its task. When the news of this victory was broadcast, a chorus of "Come on!" rang out from other teams. Then Heilongjiang, the People's Liberation Army, and other teams also successively completed their tasks, and news of victory came one after another.
    Time passed minute by minute, and the labor became more and more intense. At 9:45, the entire project was successfully completed. In just two hours, 31,100 square meters of wasteland had been turned over.
    "Two hours of labor prove that our hands are great; two hours of labor prove that our young activists are active in building the motherland," Comrade Hu Yaobang concluded.
    On the way back, the young activists frequently looked back at the new soil they had cultivated with their own hands, smiles of victory floated on their faces, and the songs became louder.

    良好的榜样
    佐平
    九月二十五日清晨，一支生气勃勃的青年的队伍，打着红旗，唱着歌，向西郊紫竹院公园一块荒地前进，青年们的胸前佩着鲜红的绸条。这就是出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的一千五百多名优秀青年的队伍，他们和中央团校三百多个同学一起，到那里去参加平整园地的义务劳动。
    参加义务劳动的消息受到全体参加大会的青年积极分子的热烈拥护。他们要用这次义务劳动来表达自己对祖国社会主义建设事业的热情；他们要树立一个榜样，让这样的义务劳动在全国青年中广泛地开展起来。山西省女青年积极分子侯叶则身体不好，同志们劝他留下，她坚决去了；双目失明的罗木命也坚持要去，他说：“我连制造生产工具的细活都做了，这种粗活还不能做吗？”一到分配给自己的土地上，这些年轻人就脱掉上衣，卷起裤脚，拿起镐、耙、锄头干了起来。
    团中央书记处胡耀邦等同志也亲自参加了义务劳动。
    解放军和志愿军的青年积极分子以战斗的姿态迎接这次义务劳动。指挥部给他们的一段荒地的工程是艰巨的，坑多、石块多、树根多。但这算得什么呢？修建康藏公路的一等功臣秦文学带头把坑填平，把大石头搬走，并且和别的同志一起开辟了一条新路。国境线上的伏击手袁应忠每一镐都翻深泥土二十多公分，汗在他的脸上一滴滴往土里掉，他毫不理会。
    女青年积极分子的劳动成绩同样出色，武秀珍是北京园艺农业生产合作社生产队副队长，干活利落、敏捷，有的男同志还比不上她；湖南省十七岁的女青年积极分子冯健赤着双脚，挑着野草，健步如飞。
    劳动从七点四十分开始，仅一小时，北京青年积极分子的队伍就首先完成了任务。当广播器把这个捷报播出后，别的队伍响起了一片“加油”声。接着黑龙江、解放军和其他的队伍也相继完成了任务，捷报一个接着一个传来。
    时间一分钟一分钟过去，劳动一分钟比一分钟紧张。到九点四十五分，全部工程胜利完成了。仅仅两小时，三万一千一百平方公尺的荒地翻了一个身。
    “两小时的劳动证明，我们的一双手是伟大的；两小时的劳动证明，我们青年积极分子建设祖国是积极的。”胡耀邦同志做了这样的总结。
    在归途上，青年积极分子们频频回顾他们亲手开垦出来的新土，脸上浮起胜利的微笑，歌声更响亮了。
