    State Council Issues Instructions on Strengthening Typhoon Defense Work
    The State Council recently issued instructions on strengthening typhoon defense work, requiring coastal provinces to further strengthen typhoon defense.
    The instructions pointed out that coastal areas of our country are often hit by typhoons in the summer and autumn seasons. Since liberation, thanks to the attention and leadership of local Party and government organizations, the vigorous assistance of stationed troops, and the diligent rescue efforts of the people, typhoon losses in various areas have gradually decreased. However, according to recent inspections, many losses are still due to the carelessness of cadres and the masses, insufficient prior preparation, and improper defense, resulting in avoidable or mitigatable losses not being avoided or mitigated. Now that the typhoon season has arrived, all localities must emphasize the spirit of "prevention is better than rescue" and "preparedness averts peril," overcome complacency, and conduct in-depth education on typhoon prevention for all types of vessels along the coast, raising their vigilance and strengthening their defense capabilities to reduce disaster losses.
    The instructions require all localities to formulate specific and effective defense measures based on the specific circumstances of typhoon strikes in each period. Meteorological departments at all levels should further improve the timeliness and accuracy of typhoon warnings; postal and telecommunications departments should strengthen the dissemination of meteorological forecasts and warnings, striving to shorten the transmission time; and relevant departments in all localities should strengthen the management of storm warning stations and scattered radio stations along the coast, giving full play to their due roles. Local governments and relevant departments should immediately organize inspections of various typhoon defense facilities, such as seawalls and dikes, lighthouse signal equipment, typhoon shelters in ports, flood and typhoon prevention materials, and safety equipment on ships such as life-saving, fire-fighting, and medical equipment, and strengthen them where necessary.
    The instructions said: In areas frequently hit by typhoons, local governments should, during the typhoon season, organize specialized agencies or designate an agency to be responsible for unified command of typhoon defense work, based on the specific situation and needs. At the same time, all localities should be one hundred times more vigilant in typhoon defense work to prevent all sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary elements.

    国务院发出关于加强防御台风工作的指示
    国务院最近发出关于加强防御台风工作的指示，要求沿海各省进一步加强对台风的防御。
    指示指出，我国沿海在夏秋两季，常有台风袭击。解放以来，由于当地党政的重视领导和驻防部队的大力协助，以及人民群众的努力救护，各地遭受台风的损失，已在逐渐减少。但根据最近检查，还有不少损失是由于干部和人民群众麻痹大意，事先准备不足，防御不当，以致本来可以避免或减轻而没有避免或减轻。现在台风季节已到，各地必须强调“防重于救”、“有备无患”的精神，克服麻痹大意思想，对沿海各种船只，应深入进行预防台风的教育，提高他们的警惕，加强防御能力，以减少灾害损失。
    指示要求各地根据各时期台风袭击的具体情况，定出各项具体有效的防御办法。各级气象部门应进一步提高台风警报的时效和准确性；邮电部门应加强对气象预报警报的传播工作，力求缩短传播时间；各地主管部门应加强管理沿海各地的暴风警报站和散布各处的收音站等，发挥其应有的作用。各地政府和有关部门对各种防御台风的设备，如海塘海堤、灯标信号设备、港口的避风锚地、防风防汛器材以及船只上的救生、消防医药等安全设备等，应立即组织检查，必须加强的应予以加强。
    指示说：经常遭受台风袭击的地区，当地政府在台风季节以内，应按具体情况和需要，组织专门机构或指定一个机构负责统一指挥防台工作。同时各地在防台工作中应百倍提高警惕，防止反革命分子的一切破坏活动。
