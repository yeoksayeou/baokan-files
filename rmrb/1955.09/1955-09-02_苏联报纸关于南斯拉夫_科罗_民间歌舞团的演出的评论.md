Soviet Newspaper Reviews Performances of the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Ensemble

    "Pravda" published a commentary by Professor Nikolai Anossov, Honored Artist of the Russian Federation: The main characteristic of the creative style of all the talented artists of the "Kolo" Folk Ensemble is the genuine folk nature of each dance. It runs like a red thread through all the programs performed by the ensemble. All the members of the ensemble set themselves the task of collecting the dances of various ethnic groups, studying them very carefully and lovingly, and reproducing them in the best form, in a truly artistic manner, and with strict requirements for interpreting and performing what the people have created.
    Another characteristic of the "Kolo" Folk Ensemble is its flawless style, which is primarily reflected in the extreme restraint of the artistic techniques the ensemble uses to infect the audience, and also in their extraordinary expressiveness. In the performance of all the dances, without exception, whether it is the dance itself, the music, or the color and style of the costumes, there is nothing superfluous. All of this becomes a unity of perfect style.
    The style and characteristics of the music and the orchestra's performance, as well as the costumes of the actors, are completely in harmony with the style and characteristics of the dance performance. The elegant and simple musical style and the solemn character of the orchestra are in line with the restraint of the dance movements, the often solemn nature of the dance, its touching intensity, and the power of the naturally revealed true passion.
    The ensemble's orchestra, conducted by Želimir Milanović, and the orchestra conducted by Brivoje Putnik, beautifully express the unique and complex tonal organization, as well as the harmonious and rhythmically distinct essence of excellent folk music. The scale of colors that the audience sees on the stage is beautifully integrated with this musical and dance picture. There is absolutely no excessive brightness, false "splendor," or any other tricks often used by performers who pursue external effects in the actors' costumes. The main colors of the costumes are white, black, red, and brown. The artistic director of the ensemble very successfully makes the performance direction of each dance, the work of the musicians of each arrangement, and the work of all the actors have a consistent tendency in thought and style.
    Speaking of the sound aspects of the dance performance, it is important to point out an interesting method, which is the use of the sound of the steps, the tinkling of men's and women's clothing, and the sound of spurs, just like a sound pattern, seemingly including them all in the ensemble's overall score. In the very chic "Classical Bosnian Silent Dance" (directed by Olga Skovran), the sound of the dancers' footsteps is also the music, because the dancers are not accompanied by an orchestra when dancing. However, this method is also used in many other dances. For example, in the "Vlach National Competitive Dance" (also directed by Olga Skovran), and the Šop National Dance directed by Brivoje Putnik, the sound of women's clothing and all possible decorations of men play a huge role.
    The Serbian "Battle Dance from the Suburbs of Rogovo" left a deep impression. This dance is only accompanied by a large drum, which is played by one of the three dancers. The role of this instrument is extremely expressive, not only in this dance, but also in other dances, such as the Macedonian "Gemit Dance" adapted by Mira Saninaja.
    In general, the music in all the programs is not only very attractive because of its full integration with the dance, but also because there are folk instruments with expressive tones in the orchestra and unique methods of playing these instruments.

    "Izvestia" published a commentary by Professor R. Zakharov, People's Artist of the Russian Federation: The dances of the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble reveal the people's character and the unique and only national characteristics of the people.
    Through dance and songs accompanying the dance, the actors of the "Kolo" Ensemble convey the emotions and experiences of their people to the audience.
    The "Gemit Dance," which dramatically depicts the scene of the mountain guerrillas fighting against the Turkish conquerors, is very wonderful. In this dance, a surprising unity of form and content is achieved. This theme of fighting for the happiness of the people, explained in historical materials, echoes the heroic guerrilla movement in Yugoslavia during the days of fighting fascism.
    The dances of the Slovene and Croat peoples are mostly powerful and joyful! The changes in melody and speed, and the patterns of movements are wonderful. The extraordinary musicality and the strict consistency of all large dance formations all prove the high skills of the "Kolo" Ensemble's actors.
    Watching the "Banat Suburban Competitive Dance" directed by Brivoje Putnik or the "Montenegrin Dance" directed by Olga Skovran once will convince you how purely and meticulously these dances are portrayed.
    The beautiful dance "Doine Dance" directed by Milan Benic is full of charming, passionate, and beautiful feminine characteristics. What is noteworthy here is the delicate and plastic movements of the dancing girls' hands.
    The Croatian dance "Lindjo Dance" directed by Zvinge Rijevagvic is fascinating with its changes. What is particularly interesting in this dance is the sudden and rapid rotation of the girls. This requires the actors to skillfully master accurate technical calculations.
    The "Classical Bosnian Silent Dance" performed without musical accompaniment is very unique. The inherent rhythm and the graceful melody of the dancers' movements are the "music" of this dance. The audience watched with bated breath the performance of this difficult and surprisingly coordinated dance, carefully directed by Olga Skovran.
    The Macedonian "Teškoto Dance" is also very magnificent. This dance not only requires a high degree of musical genius and an absolute sense of syllables, but also technical perfection. This dance begins with slow, steady, and rigorous movements, and then gradually turns into a stormy and intense dance. In this dance, the young people of Yugoslavia showed true elegance, strength, and dexterity.
    In the ensemble's program, no dance is only intended to cause superficial effects. On the contrary, all the dances of the "Kolo" Ensemble are characterized by great purity, composure, and simplicity of expression.
    Many of the dances are accompanied by beautiful Yugoslav folk songs. In these musical melodies, the beautiful and crisp singing shows the soul of the Yugoslav people.
    The costumes are also colorful. These costumes reproduce the colors of the dense meadows and the scenery of the distant mountains.
    Olga Skovran, the founder and leader of the ensemble, is a delicate and sensitive artist. With deep love and meticulousness, she recreated various folk dances. The characteristics of Olga Skovran's creative style are the love of her own national art and a good appreciation of art. This appreciation enables her to extract the essence of folk dance art and introduce them to the audience in a beautiful stage form.

    "Literary Gazette" published a commentary by Anastasiev: Watching Yugoslav dances and listening to its songs and music, you will feel as if you have a better understanding of the people of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and a better understanding of their love for their motherland, their warm temperament, and their spiritual beauty.
    It is difficult to say what is the best in the "Kolo" Ensemble's program. The dances of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia, and the songs of Croatia are so different and unique in style. The folk nature is so obvious in the dances and songs that each dance or song evokes new pleasant emotions and gratitude to the actors for this pleasure. What kind of feeling does the first program - the Serbian dance directed by the ensemble's artistic director Olga Skovran - evoke: it seems that these young men and women wearing national costumes are not dancing on the stage at all, not dancing in front of thousands of audiences, but dancing in the mountains of their hometown in the evening after work. Sometimes there are elements of folk games mixed in the dance, which can only highlight their unrestrainedness; but at the same time, we feel the high level of performance skills, skillful techniques, and the complete coordination of movements and music because of the unrestrainedness, simplicity, and composure of the dance.
    Then, the sound of an extraordinarily melancholy and deep Croatian folk song sounded. The "Banat Suburban Competitive Dance" (directed by Brivoje Putnik) gave the audience great pleasure. The Macedonian people's avenger - Gemite's dance directed by Mira Saninaja inspires the hearts with its dramatic tension. In this dance, there is no imitation of war at all. It is completely built on the expression of the emotions of people against the plunderers; at the same time, in front of us, it seems like the scenes of reconnaissance, attack, fighting with the enemy, and victory are changing. The tense rhythm of this brave dance is not only displayed in the actors' very highly plastic art, but also in the music. In this section of music, this time the main role is played by a big drum.
    The orchestra (conducted by Želimir Milanović), which is arranged on the stage and sometimes appears among the dancers, occupies a very important position in the art of dance. It seems that there are not many instruments in this orchestra, but in each dance, it makes new sounds and surprises people with its musical richness and diversity.
    There is also a dance without musical accompaniment. This is the "Classical Bosnian Silent Dance" directed by Skovran. This is a large dance, but throughout the dance stage, you can see the agile and rapid movements of the pairs of dancers that require the actors to have great energy and skill. No wonder there is such a saying among the people: young boys try the tenacity of girls.
    The "Kolo" Ensemble performed for us a vivid, unique, and truly people's art.

    "Soviet Culture Newspaper" published a commentary by Yin Popov: At the first performance of the "Kolo" Ensemble at the small operetta theater in the "Hermitage" Garden, more than half of the program was performed twice at the repeated request of the audience. This is not surprising. Because the art of Yugoslav actors is outstanding for its high skills and delicate artistic style.
    The performance style of the Yugoslav Ensemble is so rigorous and pure, and flawless in both the whole and the details.
    The Yugoslav folk dance art is exceptionally diverse. Serbian dances are different from Croatian dances, and Macedonian dances are different from Montenegrin dances. All of these are beautifully expressed by the actors of the "Kolo" Ensemble. They have subtly appreciated the indescribable poetic fragrance of folk music and dance, and can skillfully convey it to the audience.
    The characteristic of the ensemble's creative style is flawless nobility and extreme simplicity, in which there is nothing that strives to create external effects. Everything - from the color of the costumes to the precise movements of the dancers integrated with the music, as well as the overall dance structure of a certain program, is for the purpose of achieving one goal: to create an artistic image that is perfect in every detail.
    In the art of the "Kolo" Ensemble, the close integration of sound and gestures is particularly pleasing to musicians.
    The characteristic of most of the dances performed by the ensemble is that the postures of the body and hands are relatively calm. Therefore, how much expressiveness does the skillful movement of the dancers' legs have! Most of the men's dances result in an impression that is almost rigorous and of unbreakable willpower.
    It must be pointed out that the entire program is well-considered and artistically perfect. The ensemble extensively introduces us to the diverse folk dances of Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the entire program is stylistically complete and unified. This not only shows the cautious attitude in the selection of expressive methods, but also shows the willingness to endow the program with the rigor of dramatic art. This is not only to suit the performance, but also to be good at using the emotional contrast between individual programs. Sometimes, the performers successfully use this method to almost make the development of the dance reach a continuity like a symphony.

    Note: The Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Ensemble visited and performed in the Soviet Union before coming to our country. Here we excerpt and publish the Soviet newspapers' comments on the performance. - Editor (with pictures)

    苏联报纸关于南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团的演出的评论
    “真理报”刊载俄罗斯联邦功勋艺术家尼·阿诺索夫教授的评论：“科罗”民间歌舞团全体天才艺术家的创作面貌的主要特点，就是每个舞蹈的真正的人民性。它像一条红线一样贯串着歌舞团演出的所有节目。歌舞团全体人员给自己提出任务：收集各民族的舞蹈，非常细心地和热爱地研究它们，并以最好的形式、真正艺术的手法以及对于解释和表演人民所创造的东西的严格要求，来复制它们。
    “科罗”民间歌舞团的另一个特征，是完美无缺的风格，这首先表现在歌舞团用来感染观众的艺术手法极有节制；也表现在它们的非凡的表达力。在所有的舞蹈的表演中，无论是舞蹈本身，音乐，或是服装的颜色和式样，毫无例外地，都没有任何多余的地方。这一切成为完美的风格的统一体。
    音乐和乐队的演奏的风格和特点以及演员的服装，同舞蹈表演的风格和特点是完全相适应的。高雅纯朴的音乐风格和乐队的严肃特色，符合于舞蹈动作的有节制、舞蹈性质的往往严肃、它的感人的强度以及自然流露的真正激情的力量。
    由热尔格·米兰诺维奇指挥的歌舞团的乐队和由布里沃埃·普特尼克指挥的管弦乐队，极优美地表达了独特的和复杂的乐调组织，以及卓越的民间音乐的和谐的和节奏分明的本质。观众在舞台上所看到的色彩的音阶，美妙地同这种音乐和舞蹈的画面融合在一起。在演员的服装上完全看不到过度的鲜艳，虚假的“华丽”和那些追求外部效果的演出者所经常运用的其他种种。服装的主要颜色是白色、黑色、红色和棕色。歌舞团的艺术指导极其成功地使各个舞蹈的演出指导、各个编曲的音乐家的工作，使全体演员的工作，在思想上和风格上具有一致的倾向性。
    谈到舞蹈演出的音响方面，指出这样一个有趣的方法是重要的，这个方法就是运用舞步的声音、男女服饰的叮咚声、马刺的响声，正像一幅有声的图案一样，似乎把它们都包括的乐队的总乐谱里面了。在非常别致的“古典波斯尼亚哑舞”（演出指导为奥尔珈·斯科夫兰）中，舞蹈的脚步声也就是音乐，因为舞蹈者在跳舞时没有乐队伴奏。但是这种方法也用在别的许多舞蹈中。例如在“弗拉希民族竞赛舞”（演出指导也是奥尔珈·斯科夫兰）、布里沃埃·普特尼克指导的寿朴民族舞中，妇女的服饰和男子的一切可能有的装饰的音响，都起了巨大的作用。
    塞尔维亚的“罗果夫近郊战舞”给人留下了深刻的印象。这个舞仅由一面大鼓伴奏，由三个舞蹈者中的一个击鼓。这种乐器的作用，不仅在这个舞蹈，而且在别的舞蹈，例如在米拉·萨尼娜亚改编的马其顿的“格米特舞”中，都是极其传神的。
    总的说来，所有节目演出中的音乐不仅以它同舞蹈的充分融合而非常吸引人，并且也由于在乐队中有着音调富于表现力的民间乐器和演奏这些乐器的独特方法。
    “消息报”刊载俄罗斯联邦人民演员罗·查哈罗夫教授的评论：南斯拉夫“科罗”民间舞蹈团的舞蹈揭示着人民性和人民的独特的、唯一的民族特征。
    “科罗”歌舞团的演员们通过舞蹈和伴随舞蹈的歌曲，把本国人民的情感和体验传达给观众。
    富于戏剧性的描写山地游击队反对土耳其征服者斗争场面的“格米特舞”是非常精彩的。在这个舞蹈中作到了形式和内容的惊人的统一。这个在历史材料中说明的为人民的幸福而斗争的主题，和在同法西斯斗争日子中的南斯拉夫的英勇游击队运动相呼应。
    斯洛文族和克罗地族的舞蹈是多末有力和愉快！旋律和速度的变化、动作的花样是绝妙的。非凡的音乐性和所有大型舞蹈队形的严密一致性，都证明“科罗”歌舞团演员们的高度技艺。
    看一次布里沃埃·普特尼科指导演出的“巴拿特近郊竞赛舞”或是奥尔珈·斯科夫兰指导演出的“门的内哥罗舞”，就会相信这些舞蹈跳的多么纯熟，刻画的多么细致。
    在米兰内·别尼奇指导演出的美丽的舞蹈“都依舞”中，充满着迷人、热情和美丽的女性的特征。这里引人注意的是舞蹈姑娘们的手的细致的可塑性的动作。
    兹文格·里叶瓦格维奇指导演出的克罗地亚舞蹈“林德若舞”以其变化引人入胜。在这个舞蹈中特别使人感到兴趣的是姑娘们的突然的、急速的旋转。这需要演员们纯熟地掌握准确的技术计算。
    不用音乐伴奏表演的“古典波斯尼亚哑舞”是非常独特的。内在的节拍和舞蹈者的动作的优美的旋律就是这个舞蹈的“音乐”。观众们屏住气息地注视着这个由奥尔珈·斯科夫兰精心指导演出的困难而又惊人协调的舞蹈的表演。
    马其顿的“捷什克德舞”也是很壮丽的。这种舞蹈不仅需要高度的音乐天才，对音节的绝对感觉，而且需要技术的完美。这个舞蹈是以缓慢、平稳和严谨的动作开始，然后逐渐转成暴风雨般的、紧张的舞蹈。在这一场舞中，南斯拉夫的青年们表现了真正的优雅、力量和灵巧。
    在歌舞团的节目中，没有哪一项舞蹈仅是指望引起表面效果的。恰正相反，“科罗”歌舞团的所有舞蹈都以极大的纯洁、沉着和表现方法的简洁，为其特点。
    许多的舞蹈都伴随有美妙的南斯拉夫的民歌。在这些音乐的旋律中，美丽的、清脆的歌声显示了南斯拉夫人民的心灵。
    服装也是绚烂多采的。这些装束把茂密的草地和远山的风景的色调再现出来。
    歌舞团的创建者和领导者奥尔珈·斯科夫兰是一个细致而敏锐的艺术家。她以深深的爱好和细致，重新创造了各种民间舞蹈。奥尔珈·斯科夫兰的创造性的风格的特点就是对本民族的艺术的爱好和对艺术的良好的鉴赏力。这种鉴赏力使她能抽取民间舞蹈艺术中的精华，并以优美的舞台形式把它们介绍给观众。
    “文学报”刊载阿纳斯塔西耶夫的评论：看一看南斯拉夫的舞蹈，听一听它的歌曲和音乐，那就会感到：好像是更加了解南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的人民，更加认识他们对自己祖国的热爱、热烈的气质和精神上的美了。
    很难说，什么是“科罗”歌舞团的节目中最好的。塞尔维亚、波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维纳、马其顿的舞蹈，克罗地亚的歌曲是如此不同、独具风格，在舞蹈和歌曲中如此明显地感到了人民性，以致每个舞蹈或歌曲都唤起新的愉快的感情和为了这种愉快而对演员的感激之情。第一个节目——歌舞团的艺术指导奥尔珈·斯科夫兰所指导演出的塞尔维亚的舞蹈唤起了什么样的感觉呢：好像是穿着民族服装的这些青年男女完全不是在舞台上舞蹈，不是在数千观众面前舞蹈，而是在工作后当傍晚时光在家乡的山上舞蹈一样。舞蹈中有时参杂有民间游戏的因素，而这只能突出他们的不受拘束；但同时我们因为舞蹈的这种不受拘束、朴素和沉着而感到高度的表演技巧，纯熟的技艺，动作和音乐的完全协调。
    然后，一种异乎寻常的忧郁很深的克罗地亚的民歌的声音响起来了，“巴拿特近郊竞赛舞”（布里沃埃·普特尼克指导演出）给了观众们极大的愉快、米拉·萨尼娜亚指导演出的马其顿的人民的复仇者——格米特的舞蹈以其戏剧性的紧张使人心神向往。在这个舞蹈中完全没有战争的摹拟，它完全建筑在反对掠夺者的人的感情的表现上；同时在我们面前好像在更换着侦察、进攻、同敌人作战、胜利的镜头。这个勇敢的舞蹈的紧张的韵律不仅在演员的非常高度的可塑性的艺术中显示出来，而且在音乐中也表现出来。在这节音乐中，这一次起主要作用的是一只大鼓。
    布置在舞台上，有时也出现在舞蹈者之间的乐队（指挥热尔格·米兰诺维奇）在舞蹈艺术中占有非常重要的地位。好像是在这个乐队里乐器并不多，而在每一个舞蹈中，它都发出新的声音，并以它的音乐的丰富和多种多样，使人惊奇。
    还有一个没有音乐伴奏的舞蹈。这是斯科夫兰指导演出的“古典波斯尼亚哑舞”。这是个大型舞，但是在舞蹈整个阶段都可以看到要求演员有巨大精力和熟练的一对一对舞者敏捷而神速的动作。无怪乎人民之间有这种说法：年轻的小伙子尝试到女孩子们的坚韧精神。
    “科罗”歌舞团给我们表演了一种鲜明的、独特的、真正的人民的艺术。
    “苏维埃文化报”刊载因·波波夫的评论：“科罗”歌舞团在“爱尔米塔什”花园的小型歌舞剧院的第一次演出时，多一半节目都因观众的一再要求而表演了两次。这是不足为奇的。因为南斯拉夫演员的艺术，是以高度技巧和细腻的艺术风格而出色的。
    南斯拉夫歌舞团的表演风格是这样的严谨、纯洁，无论是整体或细节都是完美无缺的。
    南斯拉夫的民间舞蹈艺术是异常多样的。塞尔维亚的舞蹈同克罗地亚不同，马其顿的舞蹈又和门的内哥罗的不相似。所有这些都由“科罗”歌舞团的演员们优美地表达了出来。他们细致地体会到了民间音乐和舞蹈的难以形容的诗意的芬芳，并能巧妙地把它传达给观众。
    歌舞团的创作风格的特点，是洁白无瑕的高尚和极其纯朴，其中没有任何力求造成外部效果的东西。一切——从服装颜色到舞蹈者同音乐融合在一起的精确的动作，以及某一节目的总的舞蹈结构，都是为了达到一个目的：创造在各个细节方面都是完美的艺术形象。
    “科罗”歌舞团的艺术中，声音同手势动作的密切结合是特别使音乐家感到愉快的。
    歌舞团演出的大部分舞蹈的特点，是身体和手的姿势比较沉静。因而舞蹈者的腿的巧妙动作就具有多大的表现力啊！大多数的男子舞蹈，结果都使人产生一种差不多是严谨的、意志力坚不可摧的印象。
    必须指出，整个节目是经过缜密考虑并且在艺术上是完美的。歌舞团把塞尔维亚、克罗地亚、马其顿、门的内哥罗、波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维纳的多种多样的民间舞蹈广泛地介绍给我们，同时整个节目在风格上却是完整和统一的。这不仅说明了在选择表现方法上的审慎态度，而且也说明了赋与节目以戏剧艺术的严整性的意愿，这样做并不只是为了适合上演，而只是善于利用个别节目之间富于感情的对比。有的时候，演出者用这种方法成功地几乎使舞蹈的发展达到了像交响乐一样的连续性。
    注：南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团来我国以前曾在苏联访问演出。这里我们摘要发表苏联报纸对于演出的评论。——编者（附图片）
