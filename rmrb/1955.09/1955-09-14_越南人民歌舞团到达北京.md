Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of the 13th, and was warmly welcomed at the station by more than 1,000 well-known figures from Beijing's literary and art circles and young literary and art workers. This song and dance troupe, composed of 58 outstanding Vietnamese artists, was invited to visit and perform in China after participating in the Fifth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival.

　　Beijing Railway Station was decorated today to welcome the artistic envoys of the fraternal Vietnamese people. A huge red banner was hung high on the platform, with the words "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people" and "Welcome to the Vietnamese Democratic Republic People's Song and Dance Troupe" written in Chinese and Vietnamese. In the welcoming venue set up next to the platform, portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and President Ho Chi Minh, the leaders of the Chinese and Vietnamese people, were hung, with the national flags of China and Vietnam fluttering on both sides of the portraits. Evergreen potted plants and flowers were lined up in front of the portraits. Among the welcoming crowd of more than 1,000 people were musicians, dancers, writers, and actors, as well as Young Pioneers wearing red scarves.

　　When the train carrying the members of the song and dance troupe entered the station, the band played a welcome song, and warm applause and cheers rang out from the welcoming crowd. Those who stepped forward to the train to welcome the song and dance troupe included Xia Yan, Deputy Minister of Culture; Chen Shuliang, Deputy Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Chen Zhongjing, Acting Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; as well as Zhou Liang, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, and embassy staff. Liu Zhonglu, head of the song and dance troupe, and all the members got off the train, accepted flowers, and shook hands tightly with the welcomers with smiles. At this moment, flowers were waving inside the station, applause thundered, and cheers followed one after another.

　　A grand welcoming ceremony was then held at the station. Xia Yan, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese literary and art circles, warmly welcomed the song and dance troupe to Beijing, and wished the song and dance troupe success in its visit and performances in Beijing and other parts of China. Xia Yan said: Vietnam has been our fraternal country since ancient times, and China and Vietnam have a long and profound traditional connection in culture and art. In the arduous struggle for freedom and independence, the Vietnamese people and their literary and art workers, under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, have undergone severe tests and used art as a weapon to make great contributions to the sacred cause of striving for national independence and defending peace in the Far East. The Chinese people and Chinese literary and art workers have always regarded your victory as our own victory, because our two peoples have common experiences, common goals, and common aspirations.

　　Liu Zhonglu, head of the song and dance troupe, delivered a reply speech. He first thanked the Chinese people for their warm welcome on behalf of the song and dance troupe. He said: In the past, we stayed in the lovely capital of China—Beijing—for a period of time. Today, we feel even more pleased that we have returned to lovely China again to perform for the Chinese people, to make some contributions to the cause of cultural exchange between our two countries, and to make the friendship between our two peoples, which was already very close, even closer.

　　After the welcoming ceremony, Xia Yan and others accompanied Liu Zhonglu and the members of the song and dance troupe through the warmly applauding crowd and out of the station. After the members of the song and dance troupe boarded the cars, the welcomers still gathered around the cars, shook hands with the members of the song and dance troupe, and applauded them as they departed.
