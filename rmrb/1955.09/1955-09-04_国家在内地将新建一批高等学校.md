The State Will Build a New Batch of Institutions of Higher Education in the Interior
Xinhua News Agency

The State Council has approved the construction plans for a new batch of institutions of higher education. Currently, the relevant departments have established preparatory organizations and are actively carrying out construction work.

This new batch of institutions of higher education includes seven engineering colleges, one comprehensive university, and three medical colleges. After these schools are built and the existing schools are adjusted, China will have 208 institutions of higher education by 1957, reaching the development target for higher education stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan. The newly built engineering colleges include specialized colleges in architecture, shipbuilding, surveying and mapping, power, petroleum, telecommunications, and chemical engineering. In addition, the Northwest Institute of Technology will also be renovated.

In order to strengthen the construction of higher education in the interior and change the past phenomenon of institutions of higher education being concentrated in coastal areas, most of the newly built institutions of higher education will be located in inland cities, with the exception of a few schools such as the Shanghai Shipbuilding College, which must be located in a coastal city. Hohhot will establish Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's first comprehensive university - Inner Mongolia University and an Inner Mongolia Medical College. New higher industrial schools will be established in Wuhan, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and other places. Shanghai First Medical College will be moved to Chongqing to establish Chongqing Medical College. In addition, after the newly built Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering is completed next year, related majors from Northeast Institute of Technology, Qingdao Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Sunan Industrial College, Northwest Institute of Technology, and other schools will be merged into it. After the Wuhan Institute of Surveying and Mapping is completed, related majors from Qingdao Institute of Technology, Tongji University, Tianjin University, South China Institute of Technology, Nanjing Institute of Technology, and other schools will be merged into it, and the name of Qingdao Institute of Technology will be cancelled. After the Lanzhou Petroleum Institute, Zhengzhou Power Institute, Taiyuan Chemical Engineering Institute, Chengdu Telecommunications Engineering Institute, and other schools are completed, related majors from engineering colleges in some large cities will also be adjusted and merged. Next summer vacation, Shanghai Jiaotong University will begin to move to Xi'an, and Henan University will be established in Zhengzhou based on some majors of Shandong University, while some majors of Shandong University will remain at the original campus of Shandong University in Qingdao.

    国家在内地将新建一批高等学校
    一批新建的高等学校建校方案已经国务院批准。现在，各主管部门都已成立筹备机构，积极进行筹建工作。
    这批新建的高等学校，包括工科院校七所、综合大学一所、医药院校三所。这批学校建成并将原有学校进行调整以后，到一九五七年，中国将有二百零八所高等学校，达到第一个五年计划规定的高等教育发展的指标。新建的工科院校中，有建筑、造船、测量制图、动力、石油、电讯、化工等类专门学院。此外，西北工学院还将进行改建。
    为了加强内地高等教育建设，改变过去高等学校集中在沿海地区的现象，新建的高等学校除个别学校如上海造船学院必须设在沿海城市外，绝大部分都设在内地城市。呼和浩特将建立内蒙古自治区第一所综合大学——内蒙古大学和一所内蒙古医学院。武汉、成都、西安、兰州等地将建立新的高等工业学校。上海第一医学院将迁至重庆，建立重庆医学院。另外，新建的西安建筑工程学院明年建成后，东北工学院、青岛工学院、浙江大学、苏南工业专科学校、西北工学院等校的有关专业将合并进去。武汉测量制图学院建成后，青岛工学院、同济大学、天津大学、华南工学院、南京工学院等校的有关专业将并入，并将青岛工学院校名取消。兰州石油学院、郑州动力学院、太原化工学院、成都电讯工程学院等校建成后，有些大城市工科院校的有关专业也将调整合并。明年暑期，上海交通大学开始迁往西安，并以山东大学部分专业为基础在郑州成立河南大学，山东大学部分专业仍留在青岛山东大学原校。　（新华社）
