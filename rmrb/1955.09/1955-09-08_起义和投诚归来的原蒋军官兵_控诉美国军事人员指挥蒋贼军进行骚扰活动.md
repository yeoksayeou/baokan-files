Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th. Our reporter recently interviewed Yan Zhenwu, Hua Xiaqiang, Zhong Wenlu, Cai Huaiyan, and others, former Chiang army officers and soldiers who recently revolted and surrendered from Jinmen Island and Mazu Island. They angrily denounced the criminal activities of American military personnel in training and directing Chiang bandit troops to conduct harassment and sabotage activities against the mainland.

Yan Zhenwu (formerly misidentified as Yan Zhenghe), lieutenant intelligence staff officer of the 84th Division of the former Chiang army who revolted from Mazu Island, concurrently captain of the amphibious assault training team, Wang Fuhai, lieutenant deputy company commander of the 252nd Regiment, Hua Xiaqiang, lieutenant firing commander of the 42nd Chemical Mortar Company, and Zhong Wenlu, sergeant squad leader of the 3rd Company of the 98th Regiment of the 33rd Division of the former Chiang army who crossed the sea from Jinmen Island, Cai Huaiyan, soldier of the sampan team of the 41st Detachment of the Second Corps of the Chiang bandit "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," Zhang Zhende and others revealed the criminal activities of American military personnel, saying: In March of this year, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group stationed in Taiwan established a U.S. military advisory group on Mazu Island. This group had more than ten American military personnel, who were responsible for "guiding" and supervising the work of various arms and services of the Chiang bandit army stationed on Mazu Island, as well as intelligence, communications, logistics and other departments. The U.S. military advisor in charge of intelligence work went to the Second Section (Intelligence Section) of the Chiang bandit army's Mazu Garrison Headquarters every day to check on the work and listen to "situation reports," and collected photos of the Fujian coast taken by the Chiang bandit air force. The number of American military personnel on Jinmen Island has also been increasing continuously since this year. These American military personnel take jeeps to the Chiang bandit army's squads and platoons every day to check on training and the construction of fortifications, and they often use cameras with telescopic lenses to take pictures of the mainland coast.

Yan Zhenwu, Cai Huaiyan, and others said: There are U.S. special agent organs on Jinmen and Mazu Islands, which are specifically responsible for training and directing Chiang bandit agents and "special forces" to conduct armed harassment, reconnaissance and other activities in our coastal areas. They also report various intelligence concerning our military, political, economic and coastal meteorological conditions to the U.S. intelligence agencies and the Pacific Fleet Command. Zhang Zhende said: The motorized sampans in the 41st Detachment sampan team, which are specially responsible for transporting Chiang bandit "special forces" to the mainland for harassment, are all supplied by the U.S. special agent organ "Western Enterprises Corporation," and the operating and repair techniques of the personnel on board are also personally taught by U.S. special agents. In June of this year, the "Jinmen Branch of Western Enterprises Corporation" also dispatched a sampan from the sampan team to transport a group of U.S. special agents to Dongding Island, close to the mainland, to observe the terrain and take pictures. Yan Zhenwu said: The training plan for the amphibious assault team of the 84th Division of the Chiang bandit army on Mazu Island was formulated according to the requirements of American military personnel and special agents, and the main technical subjects such as maneuvering boats in strong winds and waves were personally taught by an American sergeant. On the night of July 18th, three U.S. special agents on Mazu Island personally led eleven members of the amphibious assault team to conduct reconnaissance along our coast by speedboat.

    起义和投诚归来的原蒋军官兵
    控诉美国军事人员指挥蒋贼军进行骚扰活动
    新华社福州七日电　本社记者最近访问了不久以前自金门岛、马祖岛起义和投诚归来的原蒋军官兵颜振吾、华夏强、钟文禄、蔡怀炎等人，他们愤怒地控诉了美国军事人员训练和指挥蒋贼军向大陆进行骚扰破坏的罪恶活动。
    从马祖岛起义归来的原蒋军八十四师中尉情报参谋兼两栖突击训练队队长颜振吾（前误为颜正和）、二五二团二连中尉副连长王福海、四二化学迫击炮连中尉射击指挥官华夏强和从金门岛渡海归来的原蒋军三十三师九十八团三连中士班长钟文禄、蒋贼“反共救国军”第二总队四十一支队舢板队士兵蔡怀炎、张振德等人揭露美国军事人员的罪恶活动说：今年三月，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团在马祖岛设立了美国军事顾问小组，这个小组有美国军事人员十多人，他们分工“指导”和监督盘踞马祖岛的蒋贼军各兵种以及情报、通讯、后勤等部门的工作。负责指挥情报工作的美军顾问每天都要到蒋贼军马祖守备区指挥部第二科（情报科）检查工作和听取“情况汇报”，并且收集蒋贼空军拍摄的福建沿海照片。金门岛上的美国军事人员，今年以来也不断增加。这些美国军事人员每天都坐着吉普车到蒋贼军班排中检查训练和修筑工事的情况，他们并且经常用带望远镜头照相机拍摄大陆海岸附近照片。
    颜振吾、蔡怀炎等说：在金门和马祖岛上，设有美国特务机关，专门负责训练和指挥蒋贼特务和“特别部队”向我沿海地区进行武装袭扰、侦察等活动。它们并把收集到的有关我国军事、政治、经济和沿海气象等各种情报报告给美国情报机关、太平洋舰队司令部。张振德说：专门负责载送蒋贼“特别部队”到大陆袭扰的四十一支队舢板队中，装有马达的舢板都是美国特务机关“西方企业公司”供给的，船上人员的操使、修理技术也都是由美国特务亲自教授的。今年六月间，“西方企业公司金门分公司”还从舢板队中抽调了一只舢板，载送一批美国特务到接近大陆的东碇岛观察地形和拍摄照片。颜振吾说：马祖岛上蒋贼军八十四师两栖突击队的训练计划，都是按照美国军事人员和特务的要求制定的，在大风浪中操舟等主要技术科目都由一个美国军士亲自传授。七月十八日夜晚，在马祖岛上的三个美国特务曾亲自带领了十一名两栖突击队队员，乘坐快艇到我沿海侦察。
