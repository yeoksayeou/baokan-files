    After Seeing the Performance of the Delegation of Culture of the Union of Burma
    Deputy Head of the Central Song and Dance Troupe, Li Ling
    Burmese art, especially song and dance, has left us with a deep impression. Burma has a long cultural tradition. Their classical dance is very famous, and they have long had specialized schools to train classical dance actors through rigorous training. The Burmese people generally love singing and dancing. For weddings, funerals, and celebrations, the masses perform songs and dances. Especially during their "Festival of Lights," every household lights candles in all windows. The streets and alleys, pagodas, and parks are filled with erected stages, and the masses freely gather to sing and dance all night long, creating a very lively atmosphere.

    The visit and performance in our country by the Delegation of Culture of the Union of Burma gives us the opportunity to see the wonderful song and dance art of the Burmese people. The Delegation of Culture of the Union of Burma performed a total of fifteen programs at the opening ceremony. Before the opening, according to their national customs, the national orchestra played an "Overture." The Burmese national orchestra's folk instrument section includes two pipes, a suona, two sets of drums (composed of drums of various pitches), and two sets of cloud gongs. They originally only intended to play one piece, but the audience's warm applause made them replay it once and then add another piece. The first part of this piece is exactly the same as the Chinese Guangdong folk music "Floating Across the Sea to Sell Sundries." From this, we can also see the close cultural relationship between China and Burma.

    After the overture was a choir with slight performance elements, "No War." This song expresses the desire of the people of Burma, China, India, Indonesia, and Ceylon to oppose war and long for peace. Five groups (one male and two female in each group) of actors dressed in the costumes of five different countries appeared on the stage one after another. They sang the demands of the people of each country using tunes popular among the masses of each country, and finally sang in unison: "We must love each other, we must unite together, and victoriously complete our common desire." This performance left a very vivid impression, passionately expressing the five countries' people's ardent desire for peace and their determination to jointly defend peace.

    Two actors also sang "Singing of Chairman Mao." This is a dedicated song written by the artists of the Delegation of Culture of the Union of Burma especially for Chairman Mao. The content describes the long-standing brotherly friendship between China and Burma and the Burmese people's respect for Chairman Mao. The prelude and ending of the dedicated song use the tune of the Chinese song "The Hearts of People All Over the World Are One." The middle section is the dedicated song. Its tune is extraordinarily harmonious with "The Hearts of People All Over the World Are One," making it feel very cordial to listen to.

    Among the dance programs, "Dance Duet" was the most popular with the audience. The theme of the dance is to express the sincere and deep love between husband and wife. This is a song and dance excerpted from a Burmese drama. At first, two pairs of young men and women perform while sitting on the ground, and then one by one they dance alone, using hand gestures, body movements, and facial expressions to express their joy and mutual care. Then they sing in pairs, and finally, they dance together in a joyous manner. In this dance, each actor's skills are very excellent, and the musical melody is also extraordinarily beautiful.

    "Di Men Ao Ge and the Dragon Princess" is also an excellent dance. It is a section from a famous Burmese classical drama. The content depicts the scene of the Dragon Princess and Di Men Ao Ge meeting.

    At the opening, a group of palace maids danced around the Dragon Princess in the forest, their dance postures elegant, beautiful and moving. Later, Di Men Ao Ge came out, found the Dragon Princess, took off his mask, and went to dance happily with the Dragon Princess. Accompanied by fast music, the palace maids' fiery dance created a strong contrast with the elegant dance in the previous section. In this dance, every actor, even the most subtle movements and expressions, performed so skillfully and accurately, it was truly rare.

    The Burmese folk dance "Long Drum Dance" and the classical dance "Royal Drum Dance" each have their own characteristics. The former is robust and lively, embodying the optimistic and healthy spirit of the Burmese people. The latter is elegant and profound, demonstrating the strict skills of classical court dance.

    Burmese clown opera is very famous. This kind of opera is approachable and very popular with the broad audience. The "Fried Cake Song" in the evening program is this kind of clown opera. The story of "Fried Cake Song" is very interesting. It tells the story of a rural girl frying cakes for her lover. When her lover does not come, an ugly and annoying suitor comes instead. The girl, unable to get rid of him, pretends to be well-meaning and gives him a hot fried cake from the hot pot. The suitor, eager to please, grabs it, and it is too late when he realizes the cake is scalding hot. In this comedic operetta, the male actor's talent is outstanding. The artists of the Delegation of Culture of the Union of Burma also performed several classical and folk music programs. One is a harp solo. This kind of harp has unique national characteristics in terms of its construction, decoration, and playing method. The performer is a famous Burmese musician. The solo often includes the accompaniment of an orchestra, making the music's color and atmosphere richer. His profound understanding of the music and his superb skills displayed in the performance are admirable.

    "Qie Qin Solo" was also very popular with the audience. This instrument is similar to our country's xylophone, but it is made of bamboo pieces.

    Their music has many similarities with the music of coastal provinces in southern China, such as Guangdong and Fujian. The blood relationship of the musical scales is very obvious. Many of their tunes are similar to local dramas in southern China, and even the suona playing style is so close, making us feel very cordial when we listen to it. (Attached pictures)

    缅甸联邦文化代表团演出观后
    中央歌舞团副团长　李凌
    缅甸的艺术，特别是歌舞艺术，给我们的印象是很深刻的。缅甸有着悠久的文化传统，他们的古典舞蹈很有名，很早就有专门的学校通过严格的训练来培养古典舞蹈的演员。缅甸的民众普遍喜欢歌舞。婚丧庆典，群众都要表演歌舞。特别是在他们的“灯节”，家家户户在所有窗口点上腊烛，街头巷尾、金塔、公园、到处搭了戏棚，群众自由地结合起来，载歌载舞，通宵达旦，热闹非常。
    缅甸联邦文化代表团到我国来进行访问演出，使我们有机会看到缅甸人民的美妙的歌舞艺术。缅甸联邦文化代表团在演出开幕式上一共演出了十五个节目。在开幕之前，按照他们的民族习惯，由国家管弦乐队演奏了“序曲”。缅甸国家管弦乐队民族乐器部分包括有两支管子、唢呐、两座套鼓（由各种音高的鼓组成）和两面云锣。他们原来只打算演奏一支曲子，但是观众的热烈掌声，使他们重演了一次之外，又加演了一支曲子。这支曲子的前段，和我国广东的民间音乐“漂洋过海卖杂货”完全一样。从这里也可以看出中缅两国的文化上的密切关系。
    序曲以后是带轻微的表演性的合唱“不要战争”。这首歌曲是表现缅甸、中国、印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰五国人民反对战争，渴求和平的愿望的。舞台上先后出现五组（一男两女一组）穿着五个不同国家的服装的演员，他们用各国群众中流行的曲调，歌唱出各国人民的要求，最后联合高歌：“我们必须互相友爱，我们必须联合在一起，胜利地完成我们共同的愿望。”这个表演，给人的印象非常鲜明，它热情地表达出五国人民对和平的热望和共同保卫和平的决心。
    还有两位演员演唱了“歌唱毛主席”，这是缅甸联邦文化代表团的艺术家们特为毛主席写的献曲。内容述说中缅悠久的兄弟般的友谊，和缅甸人民对毛主席的尊敬。献曲的前奏和结尾采用中国歌曲“全世界人民心一条”的曲调，中段是献歌。它的曲调和“全世界人民心一条”异常调和，使人听起来感到非常亲切。
    舞蹈节目中“舞蹈对唱”最受观众欢迎。舞蹈的主题是表现夫妇间的诚挚而深厚的爱情。这是从缅甸剧中节选出来的一段歌舞。最先是两对男女青年席地表演，其后一个个单独起舞，用手姿、身段和脸容表现各人的喜悦和互相间的关怀。接着对舞歌唱，最后集体欢舞。在这个舞蹈中，每个演员的技艺，都很优秀，音乐旋律也异常优美。
    “迪门奥格与龙公主”也是一个卓越的舞蹈。它是缅甸有名的古典剧中的一段。内容描写龙公主和迪门奥格相会的情景。
    开幕时，一群宫女围着龙公主在森林中跳舞，舞姿优雅、美丽动人。后来迪门奥格出来，找到龙公主，把面具放下来，走去和龙公主欢舞，在快速的音乐伴奏中，宫女们火热的舞蹈和前段优雅的舞蹈造成强烈的对比。每个演员，在这个舞蹈中，即使是最细微的动作和表情，也都表演得那么洗练，那么准确，实在难得。
    缅甸的民间舞蹈“长鼓舞”和古典舞蹈“皇族打鼓舞”各有特色，前者壮健，活泼，体现出缅甸人民的乐观、健康的精神面貌。后者优雅、深沉，表现出古典宫廷舞的严格的工夫。
    缅甸的丑角戏是非常有名的，这种戏，平易近人，很受广大观众的欢迎。晚会节目中的“炸饼歌”就是这类丑角戏。“炸饼歌”的故事很有趣，它叙述一位农村姑娘在给爱人炸饼，爱人没有来，丑陋讨厌的追求者却来了，姑娘被他缠得没法，假作好意，从热锅中给他一块滚烫的炸饼，急于讨好的追求者抓住了它，到他发觉饼是烫人的时候已经迟了。在这个喜剧性的小歌剧中，男演员的才艺是很出色的。缅甸联邦文化代表团的艺术家还表演了几个古典音乐和民间音乐节目。一个是竖琴独奏。这种竖琴在构造装饰和演奏方法上，都有独特的民族特点。表演者是缅甸的一位著名音乐家，独奏中常常加入乐队的伴奏，使音乐的色彩和气氛更为浓厚。他在演奏中表现出来的对乐曲的深刻理解和技巧的精湛，是令人佩服的。
    “箧琴独奏”也很受听众欢迎。这个乐器和我国的木琴差不多，但它是用竹片组成的。
    他们的音乐，有许多地方和我国南方沿海省份，如广东、福建的音乐相似。乐调的血缘关系，非常明显，他们的许多曲调和我国南方的地方剧相类似，甚至唢呐的演奏风格也是那么接近，使我们听起来感到非常亲切。（附图片）
