    Harbin Residents Save 1,500 Tons of Grain Monthly
    Chongqing Suburban Farmers Visit Factories to Observe Grain Conservation

    (This article is brought to you by our own correspondent.) Residents and collective mess halls in Harbin have universally launched activities to conserve grain and have formulated grain usage plans, saving the state 1,500 tons of grain each month. Zhou Sixiao, a cadre of the Guxiang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held three family meetings to conserve grain, focusing on explaining to his wife the great significance of conserving grain for supporting national industrialization, and explaining the national grain policy in detail. As a result, his wife dispelled her ideological concerns and formulated a family grain usage plan that saves 50 jin of grain per month compared to the past. Due to the influence of Zhou Sixiao's family, residents in his vicinity quickly formulated practical grain usage plans. Many workers' families have also established grain conservation covenants. Xu Chunrong, the residents' group leader of Baimai Street in Daoli District, and the family members of the workers in her group stipulated in the grain conservation covenant that they would guarantee mutual supervision and not waste a single grain of rice.

    Many units with better grain conservation have also emerged in collective mess halls. For example, the Songjiang Physical and Chemical Instrument Factory, due to the importance attached by the leadership, mobilized administrators and cooks to be meticulous in their calculations, improve operations, and adjust meals. As a result, they not only saved 70-80 jin of grain per day, but also lowered the price of food, which the workers were very satisfied with.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 4th. On September 2nd, the workers of Chongqing No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant warmly received a group of guests from the countryside. They were the chairmen and labor models from eleven agricultural production cooperatives in the nearby Baqiao and Mawang townships. Knowing that Chongqing No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has made achievements in saving grain, the farmers specially took time out of the autumn harvest to visit the factories and see how the workers were saving grain. They visited here for a whole day, visiting five canteens, reported to the factory workers' families on the increase in grain production and savings in the countryside, and also held discussions with the workers to exchange information and experiences on saving grain.

    Huang Rongchang, representative of the National People's Congress and carpenter at Chongqing No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, happily met with the farmers. He said that although we have made some achievements in saving grain, some people and some units still have wasteful phenomena, and we should pay more attention to saving grain in the future. The cooks carefully introduced the achievements in saving grain to the farmers. Currently, as a result of saving from all aspects, the factory's grain consumption has dropped from an average of 39.9 jin per person in April this year to about 29 jin in August.

    The farmers were very interested in visiting the "ground steamer rice cooking method" and the "steam rice cooking method" created by cooks Wang Desheng and Liu Jinshan in the second canteen and the steelmaking workshop canteen. These two rice cooking methods both cook raw rice in one go, which can ensure the nutritional content of the rice and also produce a high rice yield (each jin of rice can cook 2.14 jin of rice). At the same time, it can also save manpower, fuel, and cooking time.

    During the discussion, the farmers were deeply moved by the workers' creative spirit in saving grain. Liu Haifa, chairman of the Democratic Agricultural Production Cooperative, Qiu Shirong, chairman of the Dayan Agricultural Production Cooperative, and others said that we are very moved by the fact that you use linen to separate the rice when steaming it so as not to spill a single grain of rice, and you spread a layer of linen on the ground when serving rice. Although we in the countryside also pay attention to saving, it is not enough compared to you. After we go back, we must publicize your cherishing of grain to the members and women, and at the same time check to see if there is any waste, and learn from your spirit of saving. Li Shusen, chairman of the Construction Agricultural Production Cooperative, said that I used to come to the factory to carry sludge, and I usually interacted with the families of the workers, and I saw that you were wasting grain. This time I came to the factory and saw that the atmosphere has completely changed. If we were like you, there would be many more places where we could save. The rice cooking methods you save will also be useful in our cooperative, and we must introduce them well to the women after we go back.

    During the discussion, the farmers pointed out that there were still individual factory workers' families who sent grain to relatives in the countryside and other phenomena of wasting grain. The factory's trade union负责人(fuzeren) and the responsible person of the workers' families committee stated that they would further urge all factory workers and their families to pay more attention to saving grain in the future.

    When they parted, the factory's labor models and worker representatives Huang Rongchang, Xu Zhanrong, and others cordially encouraged each other to do a good job in increasing grain production and saving.

    哈尔滨居民每月可节约粮食一千五百吨
    重庆郊区农民到工厂参观节约粮食情形
    本报讯　哈尔滨市的居民和集体伙食单位普遍开展节约粮食的活动，并制定了用粮计划，每月可给国家节约一千五百吨粮食。中共顾乡区委会干部周思孝，为了节约粮食曾召开了三次家庭会议，着重向他爱人说明了节约粮食对支援国家工业化的重大意义，并详细解释了国家的粮食政策，结果使他爱人解除了思想顾虑，订出了比过去每月节约五十斤粮食的家庭用粮计划。由于周思孝家庭的影响，他附近的居民也很快的订出了切合实际的用粮计划。许多职工家庭还订立了节约粮食的公约。道里区买卖街居民组长徐春荣同本组职工家属在节约粮食公约中规定保证做到互相监督，不浪费一粒粮食。
    在集体伙食单位中也出现了很多节约粮食较好的单位。如松江理化仪器厂由于领导重视，发动管理员、炊事员精打细算、改进操作和调剂伙食，结果不仅每天可节约七、八十斤粮食，而且降低了饭菜价格，职工非常满意。
    新华社重庆四日电　九月二日，重庆第一钢铁厂的工人热情地接待了一批来自农村的客人。他们是附近八桥、马王两乡十一个农业生产合作社的社长和劳动模范。农民知道重庆第一钢铁厂节约粮食有成绩，特地在秋收中抽出时间，来参观工人们节约粮食的情形。他们整整在这里访问了一天，参观了五个食堂，向厂里工人家属报告了农村粮食增产节约情形，还和工人们进行座谈，交流了节约粮食的情况和经验。
    全国人民代表大会代表、重庆第一钢铁厂木工黄荣昌愉快地和农民见了面，他说，我们节约粮食虽然已经有一定的成绩，但有的人和有的单位仍有浪费现象，今后应当进一步注意节约粮食。炊事员们仔细向农民介绍节约粮食的成就。目前他们从各方面节约的结果，全厂粮食消耗量，已由今年四月份平均每人三十九斤九两，下降到八月份二十九斤左右。
    农民在第二食堂和炼钢车间食堂很有兴趣地参观炊事员王德盛、刘金山创造的“地甑蒸饭法”和“蒸汽蒸饭法”，这两种蒸饭法，都是用生米一道蒸熟，能够保证饭的营养成份，出饭率也高（每斤米可煮饭二斤十四两）。同时还能节约人力、燃煤和做饭时间。
    在座谈中农民对工人们节约粮食的创造精神，深受感动。民主农业生产合作社社长刘海发、大堰农业生产合作社社长邱时荣等说，你们为了不抛撒一粒饭，蒸饭时要用麻布隔起来，打饭时在地上铺了一层麻布，这些情形使我们非常感动，我们在农村虽然也注意节约，但比起你们来是不够的。回去后，一定要把你们珍爱粮食情形向社员们、妇女们宣传，同时检查一下还有那些浪费情形，学习你们的节约精神。建设农业生产合作社社长李树森说，我以前来厂挑粘水，平时和工人家属来往，都看见你们有浪费粮食的现象，这次来厂，看到风气完全变了。我们如果也像你们这样，还有很多地方可以节约。你们煮饭节约的方法，我们合作社也用得上，回去后一定要很好地向妇女们介绍。
    在座谈中农民们指出厂里个别工人家属还有把粮食送给乡下亲戚及其他浪费粮食的现象，厂里工会负责人和工人家属委员会负责人表示今后要进一步督促全厂职工和家属更加注意节约。
    分别时，厂里劳动模范、工人代表黄荣昌、徐占荣等和农民亲切地互相鼓励作好粮食的增产和节约工作。
