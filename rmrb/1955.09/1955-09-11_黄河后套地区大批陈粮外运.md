The Hetao region of the Yellow River, abundant in grain production, is shipping out large quantities of old grain. Currently, boats on the Yellow River and trucks and horse-drawn carts on land are rushing to transport the grain. From June of last year to August of this year, the Hetao region has already transported more than 99,000 tons of grain to Baotou, Ulanqab League, and other places; in September, another 15,000 tons of old grain will be shipped to Baotou.

The Hetao region of the Yellow River, due to convenient irrigation, has always been one of China's surplus grain-producing areas. In recent years, with national investment and assistance, the irrigation work has been developing daily. This year, due to timely irrigation, various grain crops will achieve a bumper harvest.
