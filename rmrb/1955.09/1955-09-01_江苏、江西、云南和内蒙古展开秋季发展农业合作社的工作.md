Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia are actively establishing agricultural production cooperatives based on the new situation of agricultural cooperation.

The cooperative movement in rural Jiangsu Province is entering a new upsurge of great development. According to the plans of the local committees of the Communist Party of China in Jiangsu Province: before the spring plowing of 1956, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangsu Province will be developed from the existing 35,000 to 100,000; at that time, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives will account for about 32% of the total number of households in the province. Now, the three special districts of Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang have begun to develop new cooperatives in a planned and guided manner. As of August 20, the Yangzhou Special District had established 1,000 new agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 4,000 cooperatives were being established. The first batch of more than 2,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the Suzhou Special District has begun to be established, and it is expected that more than 5,500 cooperatives can be established in three batches before the autumn harvest.

Farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province have begun to establish new agricultural production cooperatives one after another. There are now more than 8,000 cooperatives being established throughout the province. From now until the spring plowing of next year, Jiangxi Province plans to develop more than 26,000 new cooperatives, plus the original old cooperatives, will reach more than 40,000, and the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives will reach more than 25% of the total number of households in the province. At present, more than 50,000 cadres from government agencies and rural areas have been mobilized to participate in the work of establishing cooperatives, and the cooperative movement in nearly 10,000 townships throughout the province is about to flourish.

The movement to establish agricultural production cooperatives in the inland rural areas of Yunnan Province has been fully launched in autumn. Since August 10, in the eleven special districts of the province, nearly 200,000 rural party members and activists of various ethnic groups have carried out extensive publicity and mobilization and in-depth networking activities, specifically explaining the policies on grazing, feed, and rent for cattle in mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas, while carrying out education to strengthen ethnic unity. At present, more than 4,500 agricultural production cooperatives have been established and are about to be established in the three special districts of Mengzi, Wenshan, and Qujing.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China will send a mutual aid and cooperation work team composed of more than 1,000 cadres to go deep into various places to help farmers of all ethnic groups establish and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. As of early August, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had developed to 6,875, which is 5.1 times that of 1954. The number of Mongol, Han, Hui, Manchu, Korean, and other ethnic farmers who have joined agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 16.7% of the total number of farmer households in the region. At present, more than 7,000 mutual aid groups in the region are applying to transfer to cooperatives, and many other farmers are requesting to join cooperatives. It is estimated that the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will develop to about 10,000 next year.

    江苏、江西、云南和内蒙古展开秋季发展农业合作社的工作
    本报讯　江苏、江西、云南和内蒙古等地，正根据农业合作化的新情况，积极建立农业生产合作社。
    江苏省农村的合作化运动将进入一个新的大发展的高潮。根据全省中共各地方委员会的计划：一九五六年春耕以前，江苏全省的农业生产合作社将由现有的三万五千个发展到十万个；那时入社农户将占全省总农户百分之三十二左右。现在苏州、扬州、镇江三个专区已经开始有计划、有领导地发展新社。扬州专区到八月二十日止有一千个新的农业生产合作社已经建成，有四千多个社正在建立。苏州专区第一批二千多个农业生产合作社已开始建立，预计在秋收前可分三批建成五千五百多个社。
    江西省各地农民已纷纷开始建立新的农业生产合作社。全省现在正在建立中的社有八千多个。从现在开始到明年春耕前，江西全省计划发展新社二万六千多个，加上原有老社将达到四万多个，入社的农户将达到全省农户的百分之二十五以上。现在全省各地已动员了五万多名机关干部和乡村干部参加建社工作，全省近一万个乡的合作化运动即将蓬勃展开。
    云南省内地农村秋季建立农业生产合作社运动已全面展开。全省十一个专区，从八月十日以来，先后有将近二十万人的各族农村党员和积极分子进行了广泛的宣传动员和深入串连的活动，在山区和少数民族地区，具体讲解了耕牛放牧、饲料和租金的政策，同时进行了加强民族团结的教育。目前，蒙自、文山、曲靖三个专区已建立和将建成的已有四千五百多个农业生产合作社。
    中国共产党内蒙古自治区委员会即将派出一千多名干部组成的互助合作工作队，深入各地帮助各族农民建立和整顿农业生产合作社。内蒙古自治区的农业生产合作社到八月上旬为止，已发展到六千八百七十五个，为一九五四年的五点一倍。加入农业生产合作社的蒙、汉、回、满、朝鲜等民族的农户占全区总农户数的百分之十六点七。现在，全区正在申请转社的有七千多个互助组，另有许多农民要求入社。预计明年内蒙古自治区的农业生产合作社将发展到一万个左右。
