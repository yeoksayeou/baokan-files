Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 11th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: Hugon Hank, the so-called Prime Minister of the London Polish government-in-exile, returned to Poland on September 8th. After returning to the country, Hank issued a statement. He said that for some time he had doubted whether the path chosen by the leaders of the "Polish government-in-exile" was correct. He painfully realized that, due to their own mistakes, they had become detached from the motherland. He also said that the exiled politicians placed all their hopes on a third world war, but he did not want a world war to occur that would devastate Poland. Hank said that the repatriation movement launched by the Polish government authorities weeks ago showed him the way back to Poland. The official announcement by officials of the Polish People's Republic that the Polish authorities would not pursue the past activities of those who returned to their homeland further accelerated his decision to return home. Note: Hugon Hank went into exile sixteen years ago (1939) after the Nazi German troops occupied Poland. After the Second World War, he held various positions in the London Polish government-in-exile. He began serving as Prime Minister of the government-in-exile in early August of this year.

    所谓伦敦波兰流亡政府的总理
    汉克返回波兰并发表声明
    新华社华沙十一日电　据波兰通讯社华沙讯：所谓伦敦波兰流亡政府的总理胡岗·汉克已经在九月八日返回波兰。汉克在回国后发表了一项声明。他说他在相当时期以来就已经怀疑“波兰流亡政府”的领袖们所选择的道路是否正确。他苦痛地认识到，由于他们自己的过错，他们脱离了祖国。他还说，流亡政客们把他们的全部希望寄托在第三次世界大战上，但是，他不希望发生将使波兰遭到破坏的世界战争。汉克说，波兰政府当局在几星期前发起的流亡国外的人的回国运动向他指出了返回波兰的道路。由于波兰人民共和国官方人士宣布波兰当局将不追究回到祖国的人的过去的活动，这更使他加速作出了回国的决定。按：胡岗·汉克是在十六年前（一九三九年）希特勒德军侵占波兰后流亡到外国的。第二次世界大战后，他曾担任伦敦波兰流亡政府中的各种职务。今年八月初，他开始担任流亡政府的总理。
