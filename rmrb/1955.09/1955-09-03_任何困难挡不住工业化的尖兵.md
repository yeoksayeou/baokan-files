    No Difficulty Can Stop the Pioneers of Industrialization
    Wang Xizhi

    In March of this year, our young petroleum prospecting team—the 611th Geophysical Exploration Team of the Central Geological Department—set off from the capital of our motherland, Beijing, to carry out petroleum prospecting work in the Northwest. After a long journey of more than a month, we finally arrived in the Gobi Desert of Xinjiang, and under the guidance of Soviet experts in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Province, we spent two months studying our profession.

    On Labor Day, on the eve of our departure for the construction site, the Party, the Youth League, and the Trade Union each held meetings to discuss how to overcome difficulties and complete the prospecting task. Everyone spoke enthusiastically. We knew how urgently our country needed petroleum! With it, we could start all kinds of machines and develop the heavy industry of our motherland; with it, we could start airplanes and warships to liberate Taiwan, the territory of our motherland... The more we talked, the more excited we became. In the evening, under the dim light, everyone was writing their own letters of determination: "Fear no difficulty, resolutely complete the task!"

    "Wild Boar Forest"

    In the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, there is a lush reed area of about thirty square kilometers, with red willows and other trees growing inside, as deep as a person. In this dense reed forest, there are wild boar tracks and droppings everywhere, and piles of wild boar nests built of reeds can be seen everywhere. Therefore, people call this place "Wild Boar Forest."

    One day at dawn, the comrades of our guiding team entered this dense reed forest, walking quietly and quickly one after another. Everyone couldn't help but look around, silently muttering in their hearts: "Don't run into wild boars!" Suddenly, the comrade walking in the front cried out "Ouch," startling everyone. When we gathered around to take a look, it turned out to be a large pit just dug by a wild boar, with fresh footprints, proving that the wild boar was not far away. At this time, some timid comrades hesitated, looking at each other. Seeing this, the group leader, Li Quan, shouted loudly, "Comrades! Let's go! We can't let it affect our work!" As soon as he mentioned the word "work," it really aroused everyone's courage. The comrades continued to move forward, talking and laughing. Someone even shouted, "What are we afraid of? It would be even better if it came. We haven't had any vegetables these days!"

    After working here for three days, everyone became familiar with the environment and learned how to deal with wild animals. Xiao Yu, who used to be timid, has now become very calm. He often runs to far places to set up measuring scales by himself.

    The glorious title of "Pioneer of Industrialization" encourages us and gives us endless strength and courage. For many days, we pitched our tents next to wild boar nests, and finally successfully completed the measurement task in the Wild Boar Forest area. When we returned to the team headquarters, someone asked us if we were afraid of wild boars. Everyone's answer was: "If the pioneers of industrialization are frightened by wild boars, it will be a joke forever..."

      Gobi Night

    In the prospecting area we are responsible for, in addition to this part of the dense reed forest area, most of it is an endless Gobi Desert. Although there are no wild animals in the Gobi Desert, there are still many difficulties.

    The climate in the Gobi Desert is fickle: In the early morning, the red sun rises from the east, the sky is cloudless, and the Gobi Desert is warm and tranquil; soon, the climate changes immediately. The sunlight strongly shines on the earth, making the entire Gobi Desert radiate a scorching heat; the moment noon passes, a hot gale blows, and suddenly sand and stones fly, and the sky is filled with sand and dust; as soon as the sun sets below the horizon, the hot wind immediately turns into a cold wind, which continues to blow until dawn the next day.

    Due to the large prospecting area and inconvenient transportation, there are no people for hundreds of kilometers. Wherever we go to work, we move our homes there. Because the work team moves around, coupled with the changeable climate, it often makes everyone lose their way and unable to find their way back. They have to endure hunger and thirst outside and spend the night in the cold.

    On the evening of May 16th, as soon as a day's work was finished, we packed up the instruments and were preparing to go home. Suddenly, a whistling cold wind blew on the ground, and a dark cloud in the west rushed towards our heads. At this time, the shadow of the camels that came to help us move was not seen, and everyone anxiously looked into the distance. After a while, dark clouds covered our heads, and we could no longer see the stars in the sky! A gust of cold wind, a thunder, followed by "Ba Da! Ba Da!" It started to rain. There was no one in sight around us, and the camels that came to help us move had not yet arrived. Everyone was hungry, thirsty, and shivering from the wind and rain. If we stopped here for the night, many comrades would get sick from the cold and affect their work. Finally, everyone decided to look for the camels that came to help us move. In the wind and rain, we walked for about two hours. At this time, the wind became stronger and stronger, the rain became heavier and heavier, and we couldn't even tell the directions! It was too dark to even see the pointer on the compass! Which direction should we go? Everyone had to stop in a shallow ditch to catch their breath for a while.

    Just then, suddenly a voice came from the wind: "Hey—over here." It was the voice of our own people. Everyone, disregarding the rocks and puddles under their feet, ran towards the direction of the shout, and finally hugged tightly with the comrades who were searching for us, like relatives who had been separated for a long time. They had also been running in the wind and rain for a long time to find us. Although the wind and rain had not stopped, a happy song echoed on this quiet beach, telling of our joy after overcoming difficulties.

    It is the wind in the valley that blows our red flag;
    It is the raging rain that washes our tents.
    It is the star in the sky that lights our lamps;
    It is the bird in the forest that reports the dawn to us.
    Our fiery enthusiasm overcomes all fatigue and cold. …………

    The Source of Life in the Desert – Water

    In the hot summer, in this Gobi Desert where the dry wind howls, "water" becomes a rare treasure, even the source of our lives. Without it, rice cannot be cooked, and people will starve and die of thirst. We have encountered this difficulty before. Some people were so thirsty that they couldn't speak, and even lay on the ground, scraping away a layer of sand with their hands, desperately sucking the moisture from the ground. Sometimes even the camels were so thirsty that they opened their mouths and fell to the ground.

    Usually, because it is difficult to find water, everyone does not wash their faces or brush their teeth, and even dares not eat too salty things. Once, we were more than a hundred kilometers away from the team headquarters, and the water we brought was about to run out. At night, everyone lay on their bunks in silence, but they tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. Suddenly, someone remembered that two days ago, when we were working, we saw a road that had been walked by people before, and it was expected that there would be water in that area. So the group leader sent Song Wanshou to lead the camels to find water. The next day, before dawn, they set off on camels. The comrades who stayed at home ate a meal with only a little bit of water left at the bottom of the bucket. After eating, everyone stood outside the tent, looking into the distance for the comrades who were looking for water. They kept looking until late at night, but still did not see the people looking for water return. The next day, everyone ran to the high ground again to look, and kept looking until the sun was high in the sky, but still couldn't see anything. Group leader Comrade Li Quan told everyone to lie down and move as little as possible, so as not to cause thirst. However, the sunlight shone into the tent during the day, and it was terribly hot inside. Even lying on the bed, we kept sweating. Later, because we couldn't drink water, the sweating decreased, and even the saliva in our mouths couldn't come up.

    Thirst threatened everyone, but everyone silently endured it. No one complained or grumbled. On the night of the same day, everyone was lying on the bed thinking: We probably have no hope again today. One comrade said: "If we didn't lack water today, we would do more work!" Suddenly, we heard the shout of group leader Li Quan: "The camels are coming, the camels are coming!" Everyone heard the sound and got up, ran out of the tent to greet them. As soon as the camels were lying on the ground, everyone drank cup after cup; then they started working again!

    However, everyone did not shrink back because of these difficulties that we often encountered; on the contrary, we greeted difficulties with courage and sent them away with pleasure. Whenever we overcame a difficult thing, everyone always gathered together to sing and dance to our heart's content, and then started working intensely again.

      We March Forward Forever

    In this sparsely populated, sand-filled, and water-scarce desert, we often walk hundreds of miles without seeing a village or hearing a cock crowing or a dog barking. But we didn't feel lonely. We love the work during the day, and we also love the night scenery here. The evening glow slowly disappears, and the round moon faintly hangs in the sky. One or two stars twinkle with faint light. The camels grazing in the distance slowly return, and the bells on their necks "ding-dong, ding-dong..." At this time, we end a day's work, stand in front of the tent, drink boiled water, look into the distance, and admire the beautiful appearance of our motherland's border. Everyone chatted about their hometowns and the construction of the motherland. Some people hummed ditties, and some people said lively clappers: "Our border area is a good place; there are many ethnic groups, the land is vast, and there are treasures in the Gobi Desert. For the industrialization of our motherland, we are busy here day and night; looking for oil, mining gold, to make our border area change again..." Then there was a burst of laughter.

    Because in our hearts burned the determination and perseverance to build the industry of our motherland, and the love for the border area, the fatigue brought to us by the hard life also disappeared in the hearty laughter. Now, our work is not over yet, we will strive to complete the task. Beautiful border area! We will march forward forever!

    任何困难挡不住工业化的尖兵
    王喜治
    今年三月，我们这一支年轻的石油普查队——中央地质部六一一物理探测队，从祖国的首都——北京出发，到西北去进行石油普查工作。经过一个多月的长途旅程，终于来到了新疆的戈壁滩上，并在新疆省省会——乌鲁木齐，在苏联专家指导下，进行了两个月的业务学习。
    在“五一”节，我们临走向工地的前夕，党、团、工会都分别召开了会议，讨论如何克服困难，完成普查任务，大家纷纷发言，情绪都很高。我们知道，祖国的建设是多么迫切需要石油！有了它，才能把各种机器开动起来，发展祖国的重工业；有了它，才能开动飞机、军舰，解放祖国的领土——台湾……大家越谈越感到兴奋。晚上，大家都在黯淡的灯光下，写着自己的决心书：“不怕任何困难，坚决完成任务！”
    “野猪林”
    在新疆天山的北部，有一片大约有三十多平方公里面积的绿油油的芦苇地带，里面还长着红柳等树木，足有一人深。在这稠密的苇林里，布满野猪的蹄迹和粪便，到处可以看到用苇草搭成的一堆一堆的野猪窝，因此人们把这地方叫“野猪林”。
    一天的黎明，我们导线组的同志们钻进了这茂密的苇林，一个跟一个静悄悄地快步向前行进。每个人都情不自禁地东张西望，心里暗暗叨念着：“可不要碰见野猪啊！”忽然，走在最前面的同志“哎呀”地叫了一声，把大家吓了一跳。待凑到前面一看，原来是野猪刚刚挖好的大坑，还有新鲜的足迹，证明野猪就在左右不远的地方。这时，有些胆小的同志你瞧我，我瞧你地踌躇不前了，组长李泉一看这情景，就大声喊道：“同志们！走！不能叫它影响咱们的工作呀！”一提起“工作”两字，果然就激起了大家的勇气，同志们有说有笑地继续前进，不知谁还叫道：“怕什么，它来了更好，这几天正吃不到菜呢！”
    在这里工作了三天以后，大家都熟悉了这里的环境和学会了对付野兽的方法，平时胆子较小的小禹，现在也变得很坦然了，他经常一个人跑到很远的地方去立标尺。
    “工业化尖兵”的光荣称号鼓舞我们，给予我们无穷的力量和勇气。在许多日子里，我们就将帐篷搭在野猪窝的旁边，最后终于胜利地完成了野猪林一带地区的测量任务。当我们返回队部，有人问我们怕不怕野猪时，大家的回答是：“工业化的尖兵如果被野猪吓住，真是要永远成为笑话了……”
      戈壁之夜
    在我们负担的普查地区内，除了这一部分茂密的苇林地带外，大部分都是一望无际的戈壁滩。在戈壁滩上虽然没有野兽，但是困难还是很多的。
    戈壁滩上的气候变化无常：清晨，红红的太阳从东方升起，天空中万里无云，戈壁滩上温暖而恬静；不久，气候就立刻变了样，阳光强烈地射在大地上，使整个戈壁滩上放射着一股炙人的热流；中午刚刚过去，又刮起酷热的巨风，顿时飞沙走石，天空沙尘弥漫；太阳刚刚坠下地平线，热风立即又变成冷风，一直刮到第二天黎明才能停止。
    由于普查面积大，交通不便，几百公里不见人烟，我们到哪里工作，就把家搬到哪里。因为工作组到处流动，加上气候多变，常常使大家迷失方向，找不到归路，不得不在外面忍受饥渴、在寒冷里度夜。
    五月十六日傍晚，一天的工作刚完毕，我们把仪器收装好，正准备回家。忽然大地上吹起呼呼的冷风，西方一片漆黑的浓云向我们头顶驰来。这时还不见来帮我们搬家的骆驼的影子，大家都焦急地眺望远方。过了一会，乌云遮住我们的头顶，已看不见天上的星星了！一阵寒风，一阵雷鸣，随着就“吧答！吧答！”地落起雨来，四周对面不见人，搬家的骆驼还是没有来。大家连饿带渴，再加上风雨吹打，每个人都在发抖，如果停在这里度夜，一定会有很多同志被冻病而影响工作。最后，大家决定去找搬家的骆驼。在风雨中，大约走了有两个钟头，这时风越来越大，雨越下越密，连东西南北都分辨不出，因为天太黑连罗盘上的指针都看不见了！朝哪个方向走呢？大家不得不停在一个浅沟里暂时喘息一会。
    正在这时，忽然从风中传来一声：“喂——在这儿。”这是自己人的声音，大家不顾脚下的岩石和水坑，一直向喊话的方向奔去，终于和四处寻找我们的同志紧紧地抱在一起，像久别的亲人一样。他们为了寻找我们，也是在夜的风雨中奔走很久了。虽然风雨还未停息，却在这静穆的沙滩上响起了一片愉快的歌声，述说我们战胜困难后的愉快。
    是那山谷的风，吹动了我们的红旗；
    是那狂暴的雨，洗刷了我们的帐篷。
    是那天上的星，为我们点上了明灯；
    是那林中的鸟，向我们报告黎明。
    我们火一般的热忱，战胜了一切疲劳和寒冷。…………
    沙漠中生命的泉源——水
    到了炎热的夏天，在这干风呼啸的戈壁滩上，“水”成为稀有的宝物，甚至成为我们生命的源泉了。没有它，有米煮不成饭，人就会饿死、渴死。我们就曾遇到过这个困难，有人渴得说不出话来，甚至渴得卧在地上，用手把地下的一层沙子扒开，拚命地吸吮地下的潮气，有时连骆驼都渴得张着嘴倒在地下。
    平时，因为找水困难，大家都不洗脸、刷牙，更不敢吃太咸的东西。有一次，我们离开队部已经有一百多公里了，带来的水马上就要用完。晚上，大家都躺在自己的铺位上一声不响，但是都翻来覆去地睡不着。忽然有人想起前两天工作时看见一条早有人走过的路，预计那一带一定会有水，于是组长就派宋万寿牵上骆驼去找水。第二天，东方还没有发亮，他们就骑着骆驼出发了。留在家里的同志，这天只用剩下的一点桶底水吃了一顿饭。吃完饭，大家就站在帐篷外边遥望找水的同志，一直望到深夜，还不见找水的人回来。第二天，大家又跑到高岗上去了望，直望到太阳升得很高了，还是什么都看不见。组长李泉同志嘱咐大家躺下少动弹，免得引起口渴。可是，白天阳光射进帐篷，里边热得了不得，躺在床上仍不停地出汗。到后来，因为喝不到水，汗也减少了，甚至连口里的唾液都上不来了。
    渴，威胁每一个人，但大家都默默地忍受，没有一个人叫苦和发怨言。当天夜晚，大家正躺在床上想：今天恐怕又没有希望了，一个同志说：“今天若不缺水，我们会做更多的工作！”忽然听见组长李泉的喊声：“骆驼来了，骆驼来了！”大家都闻声爬起，跑出帐篷外去迎接，骆驼刚爬在地上，大家就一杯一杯地大喝起来；接着又开始工作了！
    但是大家并没有因这些经常会碰到的困难而畏缩不前；相反，我们是以勇敢迎接困难，又以愉快送走困难。每当我们克服了一件困难事以后，大家总是围在一起尽情地歌舞，接着又开始紧张的工作。
      我们永远前进
    在这人烟稀少、沙尘弥漫、水源缺乏的大沙漠上，我们经常走上几百里路也看不见一个村落，听不见一声鸡鸣狗吠。但是我们并没有感到寂寞。我们爱白天的工作，也爱这里的夜景。傍晚的霞光慢慢消逝，圆圆的月亮隐隐约约地悬在天空，一两颗星星闪烁着微光，到远处吃草的骆驼，慢腾腾地回来了，脖子上的铃铛“叮咚，叮咚……”地响，这时，我们结束一天的工作，站在帐篷前面喝着开水，遥望远方，欣赏祖国边疆美丽的面貌。大家在一起漫谈着自己的家乡，祖国的建设，有的人嘴里还哼着小曲，也有的人说着生动的快板：“咱边疆，好地方；种族多，土地广，戈壁滩上有宝藏。为了祖国工业化，我们在这日夜忙；找石油，开金矿，叫咱边疆再变样……”接着又是一阵欢笑。
    由于在我们的心中燃烧着建设祖国工业的决心和毅力，燃烧着对边疆的热爱，艰苦的生活带给我们的疲劳，也在尽情的欢笑声中消逝了。现在，我们的工作还没有结束，我们将努力去完成任务。美丽的边疆啊！我们将永远前进！
