    A Song of Praise for Workers Worldwide
    —Introducing the Documentary Film "Song of the Rivers"
    Huang Gang
    General Director: Joris Ivens, International Peace Prize Winner Director: Oskar, Muniegoz
    Composer: Dmitri Shostakovich, International Peace Prize Winner Lyrics: Polevoy, Kalafkin
    Produced by DEFA Newsreel Studio, German Democratic Republic

    "Song of the Rivers" won the "Award for the Struggle for a Better World" at the 8th International Film Festival. It concentrates on the contrast between the lives of workers in the socialist camp and the capitalist world. It reflects the common struggle of workers with different fates under these two systems to defend world peace. It expresses the unity, victory, and hope of workers all over the world today with magnificent, historically significant, mural-like imagery.

    "Song of the Rivers" is a majestic and beautiful poem composed of stirring music, images, and narration. It is also a magnificent piece of music that inspires the working class to advance victoriously and praises the workers of the whole world. All the material in the film was shot by thirty photographers in thirty countries. To shoot some of the scenes in capitalist and colonial countries, the photographers risked their lives. Trade unions around the world jointly sponsored this work. The birth of the film can be said to be the result of cooperation between progressive cultural circles and trade unions from all countries, and the collective creation of artists from many countries. For example, the general director, Joris Ivens, is Dutch, the famous French writer Vladimir Pozner and Ivens co-wrote the script, most of the lyrics of the film were written by the German poet Bertolt Brecht, and the Soviet writer Boris Polevoy participated in writing the narration... The creation of the film itself illustrates that this work is an important event in international film history and the world trade union movement.

      The Background of the Film

    On the fertile land of the eastern and western hemispheres, numerous winding rivers flow through the mountains, the most important of which are the Mississippi River in North America, the Amazon River in South America, the Nile River in Egypt, the Ganges River in India, the Yangtze River in China, and the Volga River in the Soviet Union... On both sides of all rivers, there also live kind and hardworking people; among them, some have already established their own happy countries, where labor has become a glorious and heroic cause; others are still in a state of enslavement, they are still appendages to machines, living a life of poverty and slavery. Based on such a realistic situation, the film's directors have arranged a very ingenious artistic structure: that is, through the different situations along the six largest rivers in the world mentioned above, to reflect the multifaceted background of our current era; this is also the origin of the film's title "Song of the Rivers."

    A fundamental idea expressed in this film is that all the wealth in the world is created by the hands of the working class. At the beginning of the film, the audience is introduced to the hands of working people of various colors, white, yellow, and black, who are changing the face of the world day by day. The film speaks in the proud tone of the working class—the creators of history—saying that if life anywhere can be decided by the working class, then the people of the whole world will surely be able to forget hunger and forget cold, and all workers will live happily like the people of the Soviet Union, and will engage in free and creative labor like one-third of humanity today.

    But today, the reality is not yet like that.

    The film then describes that "two-thirds of the people in the world still live under oppression," and they still live in cursed cold and hunger. Not only that, those warmongers who create and sell poverty and death (international monopoly capital groups), who launched two world wars in the past, are still unwilling and are preparing for a third world war...

    Look, this is the Mississippi River, which is called the "backbone of America." We know that the great American realist writer Mark Twain once wrote about this river: "Latitude, altitude, and rainfall combine to enable every part of the Mississippi River basin to support a dense population." But now, how many American workers here are not well-fed and clothed? The makers of the film, with angry passion, expose the unfree life behind the statue of "Liberty" in the United States: here, American blacks are being massacred by the Ku Klux Klan, "the Mississippi River is flooding, submerging our fields and homes"—the first interlude in the film about the six major rivers sings like this—"war also threatens to submerge everything we have created." This song sings out the anger of the American people. Thus, in the film, we see that the beautiful and wealthy Mississippi River, praised by Mark Twain, has been replaced by raging floods and angry waves. The film clearly points out that the expansion of the monopoly capital group—the forces of war—here and in many other places is the root cause of the disasters of the American people and the people of Europe and Africa.

    The film gives a high evaluation of the Indian people on both sides of the Ganges River, praising the beauty, breadth, and kindness of the Ganges "like the Indian people on both sides of it." The film tells us that on both sides of the Nile and the Amazon rivers, the working conditions of the people are still stuck in the stage of drilling wood to make fire five thousand or even twenty thousand years ago; the film then issues a sharp accusation against the imperialist war forces that deliberately hinder human progress here and attempt to seize world hegemony with atomic weapons. The film asks: Why has the era solidified in these places? "Who benefits from the backwardness of a country like Egypt?" The beautiful interlude in the film sings like this:
        Great Nile River,
        The pyramids gaze at your flowing water;
        In ancient times, we suffered the torment of slavery,
        Now we still labor like slaves.

    But from beginning to end, the film gives powerful encouragement to the struggles of the people on both sides of the Nile, Ganges, Mississippi, and Amazon rivers, encouraging them to look forward to the near future. It continues to sing optimistically:
        We are the creators of life,
        The whole world has our labor;
        Our victory is in sight,
        Like approaching our own home.

      Central Theme

    In this way, the following images are gradually displayed in the film: from the banks of the Ganges to the land of Africa, from the banks of the Nile to the Amazon River, from the squares of Tokyo, Japan to the cities and villages of Italy, from the streets of America where striking workers shed blood to the ports and mines of France and West Germany, the workers are acting in unison, their destinies are linked together; neither the high walls of prisons, nor the bullets of the police, the iron hooves of the cavalry, or the threat of the atomic bomb, can stop the vigorous development of the international workers' movement. The united ranks of workers all over the world have formed a surging and unstoppable torrent, which can not only block the road to war, but will also wash away all unreasonable things, so that the destiny of all mankind will stride towards a happy tomorrow—this is the central theme of the film.

    In developing this central theme, the film shows the leading role of the World Federation of Trade Unions. With infinite enthusiasm for caring about and understanding the lives of workers, the makers of the film present the important role of trade union organizations from the actual lives of workers around the world, showing that the international working class, which is fighting for the right to survival and defending world peace, is a strong and vast, mutually supportive, organized, led, and invincible force. The makers of the film unprecedentedly and solemnly brought the activities of workers in the African jungle to the screen. In the depths of that suffering forest ruled by French colonialists, the urgent sound of drums rang out, this is the call of the awakened people, they are spreading the deeply rooted call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, calling for the struggle for peace and a better life, and summoning African workers to elect their own representatives to participate in the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    The convening of the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Vienna, the reunion of delegates from various countries, and their return to various parts of the world to organize struggles for peace and a better life—these contents constitute a very magnificent chapter in the film. The film begins by introducing the situations of workers in various countries, explaining that the needs and hopes of workers in different regions promoted the convening of the Vienna World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, and then extends from this important meeting beyond the venue to depict the magnificent struggle of the world's workers' movement, thereby clearly showing the power of the unity of the world's working class.

    The artistic expression of the film is also unique. It uses the six major rivers as the background, allowing the audience to accept the touching impressions of the different lives of workers around the world with great interest. The film uses real people who appear continuously before and after to express the noble qualities of friendship and unity of the working class, such as the shots showing the friendship, trust, and mutual support between workers' representatives from North Africa, France, Britain, Germany, Iran, Brazil, Poland, Korea, etc., which are all meaningful and echoing moving descriptions.

    Another artistic feature of the film is that each picture has a strong expressive force, and the overall organization of all pictures also has a strict and complete logic; it is precisely because of this that the film has rich colors and great persuasiveness, allowing people to browse the world's panorama in less than two hours, deepening the audience's sympathy for the lives of people in the capitalist world and colonies, and giving them a clearer and deeper understanding of the important role of the working class in the Soviet Union, China, and people's democratic countries in the cause of defending peace.

    For example, when the film introduces the gold mines in South Africa, it shoots the heavy and solid iron gate closing after the cars full of gold are pushed out of the factory gate. The film's narration then asks and answers like this: Where does the gold dug out with the blood and sweat of African workers "go? —Wall Street! The gold comes here, and the war also comes from here." Then there appear many descriptions of Wall Street and the American way of life. The film is good at concisely and sharply analyzing the truth and essence of things in this way.

      A Vivid Textbook of Internationalism

    This film highly develops the combativeness of visualized political commentary, and is full of infinite confidence in the bright future of the working class. It is precisely on this point that all the thrilling images on the film, Shostakovich's solemn music and interludes, and the emotionally fiery and sharp narration, achieve a consistent keynote, making various comprehensive artistic elements (picture, music, sound and narration) appear very harmonious and coordinated. Here, again, because the artistic masters who made this film skillfully mastered the combative artistic characteristics of documentary films (visualized political commentary), the film fully uses and integrates a large number of sharp contrasts, ruthless irony, kind humor, and appropriate lyrical insertions, thus further enhancing the ideological and artistic effects of the film, making it a vivid and powerful internationalist teaching material.

    Joris Ivens, the general director and one of the screenwriters, said: "As an artist, I want to express the powerful and irresistible movement of workers for a better life through a unique international platform that can show the world workers' movement." This is the mood and attitude of Ivens when making this film.

    The Chinese people highly value this film. This is not only because we can happily see in this film that the ancient Yangtze River has regained its youth, that we ourselves have become the masters of transforming the rivers and land, and that we see the happy faces of our worker brothers in the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, as well as their labor achievements and the growth of welfare, but also, we can see our own responsibilities in every hungry family and every fighting line of worker class brothers in another world. This film will fulfill its clear class education and internationalist education role among the working masses and all the people of our country. This film shows us that the main foundation of all peace and democratic forces in the world—the unity of the working class internationally—has already reached a very magnificent scale, allowing us to once again relive the truth that the victory of the working class is the victory of all mankind, and making us vividly understand that unity is the source of the invincible power of the working class.

    全世界劳动者的颂歌
    ——介绍纪录影片“激流之歌”
    黄钢
    总导演：国际和平奖金获得者伊文思  导演：奥斯肯、蒙涅戈兹
    作曲：国际和平奖金获得者萧斯塔科维奇  解说词：波列伏依、卡拉夫金
    德意志民主共和国德发新闻纪录电影制片厂出品
    “激流之歌”这部影片，曾在第八届国际电影节上荣获“为美好世界而斗争奖”。它集中地表现了社会主义阵营和资本主义世界两种工人生活的对比。它反映了这两种制度下不同命运的工人为保卫世界和平而进行的共同斗争。它以壮丽的具有历史意义的壁画式的图景，表达出今天全世界工人的团结、胜利和希望。
    “激流之歌”是以激动人心的音乐、画面和解说词组成的一部雄伟美丽的诗歌，又是一首鼓舞工人阶级胜利进军和赞颂全世界劳动者的雄壮乐曲。影片的全部材料，是由三十位摄影师在三十个国家里拍摄的，为了拍摄资本主义和殖民地国家中的某些镜头，摄影者曾冒着生命的危险进行工作。世界各国工会协同赞助了这项工作。影片的诞生可以说是世界进步的文化界和各国工会的合作的结晶，是许多国家艺术家们的集体创作。如总导演约里斯·伊文思是荷兰人，法国著名作家符拉基米尔·波兹纳和伊文思共同编剧，影片的大部分歌词是德国诗人伯特豪尔·布莱赫特写作的，参加写作解说词的有苏联作家鲍里斯·波列伏依……，影片的创作本身，就说明了这部作品是国际电影历史和世界工会运动中的一桩重要事件。
      影片的背景
    在东西两半球富饶的土地上，在丛山峻岭间奔流着无数条蜿蜒的河流，其中最主要的有北美洲的密士失必河、南美洲的亚马逊河、埃及的尼罗河、印度的恒河、中国的长江和苏联的伏尔加河……在所有河流的两岸，同样都居住着善良的爱好劳动的人民；他们中间，有的人已经建立了自己幸福的国家，劳动在那儿已变成了光荣豪迈的事业；有的人却还处在被奴役的状态里，他们仍旧是机器的附属品，过着贫困和奴隶的生活。影片的编导者根据这样的现实情景，安排了一个很巧妙的艺术结构：就是通过上面说到的全世界最大的六条河流沿岸各不相同的情况，反映出我们当前时代多方面的背景；这也就是影片取名“激流之歌”的来由。
    这部影片所表现的一个根本思想就是：世界上所有的财富，都是工人阶级的双手所创造的。影片一开始就向观众介绍：白颜色的、黄颜色的、黑颜色的，各种不同肤色的劳动人民的双手，正在一天天地改变着世界的面貌；影片以工人阶级——历史的创造者——自豪的语调讲道：如果任何地方的生活能由工人阶级来决定，那末，全世界人民一定都能忘记饥饿，忘记寒冷，全体劳动者一定都会像苏联人民那样地过着幸福的生活，会像世界上现今三分之一的人类那样，进行自由的、创造性的劳动。
    但在今天，事实还并不是那样。
    影片接着就描写到：“世界上三分之二的人民现在还生活在被压迫之下”，他们还生活在可诅咒的寒冷和饥饿中。不仅如此，那些制造、贩卖贫困和死亡的战争贩子们（国际垄断资本集团），过去发动了两次大战，现在还不甘心，正在准备第三次大战……
    看吧，这是被称为“美国的主干”的密士失必河；我们知道，美国伟大的现实主义作家马克·吐温曾经为这条河流写道：“纬度，海拔，雨量，三者相合使密士失必河流域的每一部分都能供养稠密的人口。”但是现在，有多少美国的劳动者在这里却不知温饱；影片的制作者们，用愤怒的激情，揭露了美国“自由神”像背后毫不自由的生活：在这儿，美国的黑人正在被三K党人屠杀，“密士失必河河水泛滥，淹没我们的田地与家园”——影片中关于六大河流的第一支插曲就这样唱道——“战争也威胁着，要淹没我们创造的一切”。这支歌唱出了美国人民的愤怒。于是我们在影片中就看见，那被马克·吐温赞美过的、美丽富庶的密士失必河，已经被泛滥的洪水和愤怒的波涛所代替了。影片明显地指出：垄断资本集团——战争势力在这儿和其它很多地方的势力扩张，正是美国人民和欧洲、非洲等地人民灾难的总根源。
    影片对于恒河两岸的印度人民给予了很高的估价，赞扬了恒河的美丽、宽广和善良，“如同它两岸的印度人民一样”。影片告诉我们说：在尼罗河和亚马逊河两岸，人民的劳动条件到今天还停留在五千年甚至是两万年前的钻木取火阶段；影片接着就对有意在这里阻碍人类的进步、并且企图用原子武器取得世界霸权的帝国主义战争势力发出了尖锐的控诉。影片质问道：为什么时代在这些地方凝固了？“埃及国这样的落后，对谁有好处？”电影中优美的插曲便这样唱道：
        伟大的尼罗河，
        金字塔望着你的流水；
        在古代，我们受奴隶制的折磨，
        现在依然是奴隶似的劳动。
    但是影片从头到底都给尼罗河、恒河、密士失必河和亚马逊河两岸人民的斗争以有力的鼓舞，鼓舞他们去展望不久的将来。它乐观地继续唱道：
        我们是生活的创造者，
        全世界都有我们的劳动；
        我们的胜利在望，
        就像走近自己的家园。
      中心主题
    这样，影片中就渐次展现了下面的图景：从恒河两岸到非洲的土地，从尼罗河畔到亚马逊河，从日本东京的广场到意大利的城市和农村，从美国罢工工人流血斗争的大街上到法国、西德的港口和矿井，工人们都一致行动，他们的命运都连在一起；无论是监狱的高墙，无论是警察的子弹，骑兵的铁蹄，原子弹的恐吓，都不能够阻挡国际工人运动的蓬勃发展。全世界团结起来的工人队伍，形成了一股汹涌澎湃不可阻挡的激流，它不但能够堵塞战争的道路，而且将会冲走一切不合理的事物，使全体人类的命运都朝着幸福的明天大踏步前进——这就是影片的中心主题。
    影片在展开这一中心主题时，显示了世界工会联合会的领导作用。影片的制作者们用关怀和了解工人生活的无限热情，从世界工人的实际生活中呈现出工会组织的重大作用，显示了为争取生存权利、保卫世界和平的国际工人阶级是一支坚强浩大、彼此支援、有组织有领导和不可战胜的队伍。影片的制作者们破天荒第一次地把非洲丛林中的工人活动郑重地搬上了银幕。就在那法国殖民者统治的苦难的森林深处，响起了急切的敲鼓声，这是觉悟了的人民的呼唤，他们是在传布着世界工联深入人心的号召，它号召为和平和美好生活而斗争，它召集非洲工人推选自己的代表去参加世界工联第三次代表大会。
    维也纳世界工联第三次代表大会的召开，各国代表的团聚以及他们返回世界各地去为和平、为美好生活而组织的斗争——这些内容，构成了影片中十分辉煌的章节。影片从介绍各个不同国家的工人情况开始，说明了不同地区工人的需要和希望促成了维也纳世界工联代表大会的召开，然后又从这次重要的会议延伸到会场以外去描绘全世界工人运动波澜壮阔的斗争，从而脉络鲜明地显示了全世界工人阶级的团结的力量。
    影片的艺术表现形式，也是具有特色的。它以六大河流为背景，使观众极有兴趣地接受了全球各地工人不同生活的感人印象。影片通过前前后后连续出现的真实人物来表现工人阶级友爱团结的高尚品质，例如表现北非、法国、英国、德国、伊朗、巴西、波兰、朝鲜等国工人代表之间的友爱信赖和互相支援的镜头等等，都是意味深长和前后呼应的动人描写。
    影片的另一个艺术特色，就是每一幅画面都有强烈的表现力，而全部画面的整体组织也有严密完整的逻辑；正是这样，影片才具有丰富的色调和巨大的说服力，使人在不到两小时内就浏览了世界的全貌，使观众对资本主义世界和殖民地人民生活加深了同情，对苏联、中国和人民民主国家工人阶级在保卫和平事业中的重要作用，有了更清晰深刻的认识。
    例如影片介绍到南非洲金矿时，拍摄到满载着金块的车子被推出工厂大门后，沉重而牢固的铁门就关闭了，影片的解说词这时就这样问答道：经过非洲工人的血汗挖出的金子“到哪里去了？——华尔街！金子到了这里，战争也是从这里来的。”接着就出现了华尔街和美国生活方式的许多描写。影片就是善于这样简括、尖锐地剖析事物的真象和本质。
      生动的国际主义教材
    这部影片高度地发挥了形象化政论的战斗性，充满了对工人阶级的美好将来的无限信心。正是在这一点上，影片画面上所有惊心动魄的形象，萧斯塔科维奇的庄严的音乐和插曲，以及情感炽烈的锋利的解说词，就取得了一致的基调，使各种综合的艺术成分（画面、音乐、音响和解说）显得十分谐和、调协。在这里，又由于制作此片的艺术大师们熟练地掌握了纪录影片（形象化的政论）战斗性的艺术特点，影片中就充分运用和综合了大量尖锐的对比，无情的嘲讽，亲切的幽默，恰到好处的抒情穿插，因此就愈加增强了影片的思想艺术效果，使它成为生动的、有强大感染力量的国际主义教材。
    总导演兼编剧之一的伊文思说：“作为一个艺术家，我想通过一个唯一能够显示世界工人运动的国际讲台，以便表达工人为美好生活而进行的强大和不可抗拒的运动”。这就是伊文思制作这部影片时的心情和态度。
    中国人民十分珍贵这部影片。这不仅是因为我们可以在这影片里欣喜地看到古老的长江恢复了她的青春，看到我们自己已成为改造河流和土地面貌的主人，看到以苏联为首的社会主义类型国家工人兄弟幸福的面影以及他们的劳动成就和福利的增长，而且，还可以在另一个世界的工人阶级弟兄每一个饥饿的家庭和每一支战斗的行列中看到我们自己的责任。这部影片将在我国工人群众和全体人民中，尽到它鲜明的阶级教育和国际主义教育的作用。这部影片，使我们看到形成世界所有和平民主力量的主要基础——国际间工人阶级的团结——已经有了十分雄伟的规模，使我们又一次地重温了工人阶级的胜利就是全人类胜利的真理，使我们生动地懂得了团结一致是工人阶级战无不胜的力量的泉源。
