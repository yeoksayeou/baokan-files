    Cease the Terrorist Actions of the South Vietnamese Authorities in Violation of the Geneva Accords
    Li Gao
    Holding consultative conferences by the authorities responsible for the northern and southern regions of Vietnam, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, to achieve free general elections throughout Vietnam, is the most important step in completing the unification of Vietnam and consolidating peace in Indochina, and is the most urgent demand of all Vietnamese people today. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people are waging a resolute struggle for this. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, with the support of the United States, disregarding the repeated proposals of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, refuses to conduct consultations on the issue of general elections, and is intensifying large-scale terrorist suppression operations in South Vietnam, attempting to extinguish the patriotic movement of the South Vietnamese people demanding consultative conferences, creating a very serious situation in South Vietnam.

    During the initial 300 days of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its supporters, in the areas where the French Federal forces were withdrawing and in the temporary assembly areas, seriously violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the protection of residents' lives and property and guaranteeing residents' freedom to choose their place of residence, using various violent means to force residents to move south; at the same time, they deprived residents in the French Federal forces' regrouping areas of the right to freely choose to reside in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These atrocities aroused the indignation of just world public opinion.

    At the same time, from the beginning of the ceasefire until now, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has violated the Geneva Accords by taking terrorist, retaliatory, and discriminatory actions against former resistance personnel in the temporary and re-assembly areas of the French Federal forces, and measures to suppress those who advocate peace and national unity have continued unabated and have not been effectively stopped.

    Before the ceasefire, the vast areas of South Vietnam were base areas or guerrilla zones liberated by the Vietnamese people from colonial rulers. A large number of patriotic men and women participated in or supported the resistance forces, and waged a long and arduous struggle against the colonial rulers. They are the backbone of the South Vietnamese people in striving for the peace, independence, and unity of their motherland, and are the heartfelt supporters of the Geneva Accords. After the ceasefire, they unhesitatingly restored peaceful life in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and strived to promote the realization of the Geneva Accords. The Geneva Accords made clear guarantees for their safety and democratic freedom. Article 9 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Article 14(c) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam strictly stipulate that the South Vietnamese authorities shall not take any retaliatory or discriminatory actions against any person or group because of their wartime activities, and shall guarantee their democratic freedoms.

    However, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its supporters blatantly violated these solemn provisions of the Geneva Accords. Wherever they went, they began to carry out acts of retaliation such as arrests, torture, and massacres against former resistance personnel and their sympathizers. Since November of last year, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime has launched a so-called "denounce the communists movement," systematically persecuting former resistance personnel throughout South Vietnam. In order to carry out this bloody suppression, the United States specially reorganized and re-equipped Ngo Dinh Diem's army. The United Press International revealed on December 26th of last year: "The reorganized Vietnamese troops will consist of highly mobile companies equipped with jeeps, a large number of automatic weapons, and telecommunications equipment, so that they can quickly penetrate into rural areas... to search for communist leaders." The Ngo Dinh Diem clique forced all those who had participated in the war against colonial rulers and all those who supported the Geneva Accords to "surrender," investigate all their activities during the war, and force them to admit to fabricated crimes such as "hiding weapons" and "receiving foreign subsidies." At the same time, they forced local residents to carry out so-called "accusations," and then sent military police to "search" or "mop up" village by village and township by township according to blacklists, massacring and arresting former resistance personnel in large numbers. Those arrested were imprisoned in so-called "re-education camps," which were actually Hitler-style concentration camps, subjected to all kinds of appalling abuse and torture. According to incomplete statistics, in this so-called "denounce the communists movement," by July of this year, 9,100 people had been arrested and imprisoned, 482 had been brutally murdered, 194 were missing, and 692 were injured.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its supporters have also cruelly persecuted and suppressed all others who express support for the Geneva Accords, advocate peaceful reunification of the motherland, and demand democratic freedoms, even killing children. Many well-known figures from all walks of life in Saigon, Cholon, Hue, and other places—including educators, scientists, doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.—were arrested in large numbers by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique for participating in the movement to defend peace and advocating the maintenance of the Geneva Accords and the consolidation of peace. In July of this year, in Xinli Village and Xinxie Village in Quang Tri Province, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities inhumanely massacred 31 children. In this way, in the year since the ceasefire, according to preliminary statistics, more than 5,400 South Vietnamese people have been killed or injured, and more than 25,000 have been arrested.

    In this atmosphere of terror and slaughter, the South Vietnamese people's freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly have been deprived, and the people's movements have also been restricted. In addition to implementing a strict censorship system, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime has also closed down more than a dozen newspapers in South Vietnam, arrested some journalists, and prohibited the people from reading and listening to newspapers and broadcasts that were dissatisfied with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's fascist rule. Strikes by workers and rallies and demonstrations by people from all walks of life in South Vietnam have been suppressed and crushed by Ngo Dinh Diem's military police every time. Ngo Dinh Diem also forced people to carry so-called "identity cards" when entering and leaving in order to control the people's movements. Recently, as the movement of the people in South Vietnam demanding general elections has become increasingly high, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's suppression has become increasingly frantic. On August 16, Ngo Dinh Diem arrested more than 2,000 civilians in Saigon and Cholon in one night during a so-called "sudden general inspection." Ngo Dinh Diem's armed forces have also repeatedly invaded the demilitarized zone near the provisional military demarcation line, massively shooting, killing, and arresting people. The French bourgeois publication "Paris Match" once pointed out: "There is no regime more anti-democratic than the current Ngo Dinh Diem regime in South Vietnam." The Saigon "Morning Post," controlled by the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, also complained: "The lack of democracy and freedom is serious," "The people cannot help but reveal their anxiety," and "The people's safety and lives are under more serious threat than ever before." Even former South Vietnamese Army Chief of Staff Nguyen Van Hinh said: "The Saigon government is pursuing a fascist policy, in which there is neither individual freedom nor freedom of thought, and this regime is unpopular."

    In order to cover up its terrorist and anti-democratic actions in violation of the Geneva Accords, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has been taking measures to prevent the International Commission's mobile inspection teams from conducting investigations in South Vietnam, and even incited hooligans to cause trouble, making it impossible for the International Commission to carry out its work.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique dares to disregard international agreements in this way and carry out terrorist suppression of former resistance personnel and people demanding peaceful reunification of Vietnam because it has the support of the United States. Since the ceasefire in Indochina, the United States has openly violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords, interfered in the internal affairs of South Vietnam, illegally transported military personnel and combat materials into South Vietnam, intensified the control, training, equipment, and expansion of Ngo Dinh Diem's army and police forces, and infiltrated all aspects of South Vietnam's politics, economy, and culture. The United States also specially transferred Edward Lansdale, a secret service chief who has consistently carried out dark activities to suppress the people, from the Philippines to South Vietnam, established an all-pervasive spy network, and helped the Ngo Dinh Diem clique suppress the South Vietnamese people. The Associated Press openly stated on June 12: "The most resolute American supporting Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem is Colonel Edward Lansdale, who is responsible for psychological warfare," who has "traveled extensively" in South Vietnam and "has deployed intelligence personnel throughout Indochina." The British bourgeois newspaper "News Chronicle" also pointed out: "Since the ceasefire, the United States has supported Ngo Dinh Diem, whom they regard as another Chiang Kai-shek or Syngman Rhee."

    However, it is impossible for the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its American supporters to use terrorist means to stifle the South Vietnamese people's strong will to demand general elections and reunification. The heroic and patriotic South Vietnamese people have been awarded the glorious title of "Copper Wall of the Motherland" by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and they have been engaged in a nearly 100-year arduous struggle for the peace, unity, and independence of their motherland together with the entire Vietnamese people. The planes and artillery of the colonial rulers in the past could not conquer them, and today Ngo Dinh Diem's butcher knives and prisons cannot subdue them either. Recently, from Saigon and Cholon to the north to Quang Nam and Thua Thien, and to the south to Sa Dec and Chau Doc, the cities and villages are filled with calls for holding consultative conferences and realizing general elections. In many areas, the people are braving Ngo Dinh Diem's massacres and suppressions to carry out large-scale strikes, market strikes, and demonstrations, showing the South Vietnamese people's indomitable heroism. The South Vietnamese people's just struggle has received the support of the entire Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people in the world.

    制止南越当局违反日内瓦协议的恐怖行动
    李高
    按照日内瓦协议由越南北方和南方地区负责当局举行协商会议，实现全越自由普选，是完成越南统一和巩固印度支那和平最重要的步骤，是全越南人民当前最迫切的要求。越南民主共和国政府和越南全体人民正为此而进行坚决的斗争。但是，南越的吴庭艳集团却在美国的支持下，不顾越南民主共和国政府一再的建议，拒绝进行讨论普选问题的协商，在南越加紧进行大规模的恐怖镇压行动，企图扑灭越南南部人民要求举行协商会议的爱国运动，造成了南越十分严重的局势。
    在停战协定执行的最初三百天里，吴庭艳集团及其支持者在法兰西联邦部队撤退区和临时集结地区，就曾严重地破坏日内瓦协议中关于维护居民生命财产、保证居民选择居住地区的自由的各项条款，使用各种暴力手段强迫居民南迁；同时，剥夺了法兰西联邦部队重新集结区的居民自由选择居住于越南民主共和国的权利。这些暴行曾引起世界公正舆论的愤慨。
    同时，吴庭艳集团从停战开始到现在，违反日内瓦协议，对法兰西联邦部队临时集结区和重新集结区内的前抗战人员采取恐怖、报复和歧视行动，以及对赞成和平和全国统一的人们采取镇压措施的事件，一直有加无已，仍然没有得到有效制止。
    越南南方的广大地区在停战前是被越南人民从殖民统治者手中解放了的根据地或游击区。大量爱国男女曾参加或支持抗战部队，同殖民统治者进行了长期的艰苦斗争。他们是南越人民中争取祖国的和平、独立、统一的中坚，是日内瓦协议的衷心的拥护者。停战以后，他们毫不犹豫地按照日内瓦协议的规定，恢复了和平生活，并为促进日内瓦协议的实现而努力。日内瓦协议对于他们的安全和民主自由作了明确的保证。日内瓦会议最后宣言第九条和越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条丙款，都严格地规定，南越当局不得对任何人和团体因其战时的活动而加以任何报复和歧视，并应保证他们的民主自由。
    但是，吴庭艳集团及其支持者却明目张胆地破坏了日内瓦协议的这些庄严条款。他们每到一处，就开始对前抗战人员及其同情者施行逮捕、拷打、屠杀等报复行为。从去年十一月起，吴庭艳政权竟发动所谓“告发共产党运动”，有系统地迫害南越各地的前抗战人员。为了实行这种血腥的镇压，美国还特地改编和重新装备了吴庭艳的军队。合众社在去年十二月二十六日透露：“重新组织后的越南部队将由机动性很强的连队组成，这些连队拥有吉普车、大量的自动武器和电讯装备，这样他们就能迅速地深入乡村地区，……搜索共产党领袖们。”吴庭艳集团强迫一切曾参加反抗殖民统治者的战争以及一切拥护日内瓦协议的人们“自首”，追究他们在战时的一切活动，并强迫他们承认所谓“私藏军火”、“接受外来津贴”等等莫须有的罪名。同时，强迫当地居民进行所谓“控告”，然后是派军警按黑名单逐村逐乡地“搜查”或“扫荡”，把前抗战人员大批地残杀和逮捕。被捕的人们被关进所谓“再教育营”，实即希特勒式的集中营，施以各种惨不忍闻的虐待和酷刑。据不完全的统计，在这个所谓“告发共产党运动”中，到今年七月为止，已有九千一百人被逮捕监禁，四百八十二人被惨杀，一百九十四人失踪，六百九十二人受伤。
    吴庭艳集团及其支持者对其他一切表示拥护日内瓦协议、主张和平统一祖国和要求民主自由权利的人们，同样加以凶残地迫害和镇压，甚至连儿童也遭到杀戮。西贡、堤岸、顺化等地各阶层中许多知名人士——包括教育家、科学家、医师、律师、工程师等——因为参加保卫和平的运动，主张维护日内瓦协议和巩固和平，就被吴庭艳集团大批逮捕。今年七月在广治省的新立村和新协村等地，吴庭艳当局竟毫无人性地惨杀了三十一名儿童。就这样，在停战以来的一年中，据初步统计，南越人民有五千四百多人被打死或打伤，二万五千多人被逮捕。
    在这种恐怖屠杀气氛中，南越人民的言论自由、出版自由、集会自由都被剥夺了，人民的出入行动也都受到限制。吴庭艳政权除了施行严格的新闻检查制度之外，还封闭了南越的十多家报纸，逮捕了一些新闻工作者，并且禁止人民阅读和收听不满吴庭艳集团法西斯统治的报纸和广播。南越各地工人举行罢工、各界人民举行集会、示威等，每一次都受到吴庭艳军警的摧残和镇压。吴庭艳又强迫人民出入要带所谓“身份证”以箝制人民的行动。最近，因为南越各地人民要求普选的运动愈来愈高涨，吴庭艳集团的镇压也越来越疯狂。八月十六日一夜之间，吴庭艳就在西贡、堤岸的一次所谓“突击大检查”中逮捕了平民两千多人。吴庭艳的武装部队并屡次侵入临时军事分界线附近的非军事区内，大批地开枪屠杀和逮捕人民。法国资产阶级刊物“巴黎竞赛”曾经指出：“没有比南越目前的吴庭艳政权更反民主的了。”吴庭艳政权控制下的西贡“晨报”也诉苦说：“缺少民主和自由的情况是严重的”，“人民无法使他们的不安情绪不流露出来”，“人民的安全和生活受到了比以往任何时候都要来得严重的威胁”。甚至连前任南越陆军参谋长阮文馨也说：“西贡政府正在奉行一项法西斯政策，其中既没有个人自由也没有思想自由，这个政权是不得人心的。”
    吴庭艳集团为掩盖它这种违反日内瓦协议的恐怖和反民主的行动，一直在采取办法阻止国际委员会机动视察小组在南越进行调查，甚至鼓动流氓分子进行捣乱，使国际委员会无法进行工作。
    吴庭艳集团敢于这样蔑视国际协议，对前抗战人员和要求越南实现和平统一的人民进行恐怖镇压，是得到美国的支持的。美国从印度支那停战以来，就一直露骨地违反日内瓦协议的规定，干涉南越内政，非法向南越运入军事人员和作战物资，加紧控制、训练、装备和扩建吴庭艳的陆军和警察部队，并渗入到南越的政治、经济、文化等一切方面。美国还特地从菲律宾把一贯进行镇压人民的黑暗活动的特务头子爱德华·兰斯达尔调到了南越，建立起无孔不入的特务网，帮助吴庭艳集团镇压南越人民。美联社在六月十二日公开说：“支持吴庭艳总理的最坚决的美国人是负责心理战的爱德华·兰斯达尔上校”，他在南越“作过非常多的旅行”，“已在印度支那各地布置了情报人员”。英国资产阶级报纸“新闻纪事报”也曾经指出：“自从停火以后，美国就支持吴庭艳，他们认为吴庭艳是另一个蒋介石或李承晚。”
    但是，吴庭艳集团和美国支持者要想以恐怖手段来扼杀南越人民要求普选和统一的坚强意志是不可能的。英勇爱国的南越人民曾经获得胡志明主席所奖授的“祖国的铜墙铁壁”的光荣称号，他们和全越人民一道为了祖国的和平、统一和独立进行了将近一百年的艰苦斗争。过去殖民统治者的飞机大炮征服不了他们，今天吴庭艳的屠刀和牢狱也不能使他们屈服。最近，从西贡、堤岸，北至广南、承天，南至沙沥、朱笃等地的城镇乡村，到处都充满了要求举行协商会议、实现普选的呼声。许多地区的人民并冒着吴庭艳的屠杀镇压，举行大规模的罢工、罢市和游行示威等斗争，显示了南越人民不屈不挠的英勇气概。南越人民这种正义的斗争，得到了整个越南人民和世界一切爱好和平人民的支持。
