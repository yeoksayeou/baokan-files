    The phenomenon of serious waste of transportation capacity in the Datong City Transportation Company's automobile team

    To the Editor:
    In the first half of this year, the Datong City Transportation Company sent an automobile team of eighteen vehicles to Huairen Station to help the Yanbei Industrial Bureau's Makou Mine transport coal. However, after this team arrived in Huairen, its performance at work was very poor. The attendance rate of other teams was at least 80% or more every day, but the attendance rate of this team was only about 46% on average; from Huairen Station to E'maokou is only seventeen *li*, other teams' cars made as many as fourteen round trips, averaging about nine, while this team's cars averaged only four round trips per day. Especially on June 16th, another team was transferred away from Huairen, and instead of working better to complete the transport tasks, the Datong City Transportation Company's team adopted a passive and sluggish approach, resulting in the hauling volume dropping from more than 120 tons per day to more than 40 tons.
    Why is the work situation of this team so bad? It turns out that some drivers in this team have serious hired labor viewpoints. They believe that earning the same amount of money whether they haul more or less, they are not actively completing the state's transportation tasks. For example, some drivers often use the excuse that the car is broken down, and stop to rest halfway, or go to the mountains to pick flowers. Sometimes when the car has a minor problem, they refuse to drive. Some drivers even deliberately remove parts, so they can use the excuse that the car has a problem and refuse to drive.
    The reason why this phenomenon can occur is that the leaders of the Datong City Transportation Company have serious bureaucratic work styles and have abandoned ideological education work for the workers. After the team came to Huairen, no staff meeting was held in four months, rewards and punishments were unclear, and management was chaotic. The team leader also adopted a laissez-faire and protective attitude towards the workers' mistakes. For example, not long ago, the coal on a vehicle of this team had not been unloaded, and the driver Yang Qingsheng drove the car away, causing a personal injury accident in which worker Xue Zhengbao was injured. At that time, the team leader was also in the car. Not only did he not stop the driver's mistake, but after the accident, he ordered Yang Qingsheng to drive the car away.
    It should be pointed out that Datong City's transportation tasks are very heavy this year, and there is a shortage of vehicles. In May, four mines under the Yanbei Industrial Bureau, including Zhifengshan, Dujiagou, Xiaoheigou, and Erpu, had a large backlog of coal that could not be transported due to insufficient transportation capacity. However, the Datong City Transportation Company turns a blind eye to this serious phenomenon of waste of transportation capacity in its automobile team, which is very wrong.

### 大同市运输公司所属汽车队浪费运输力的现象很严重

    大同市运输公司所属汽车队浪费运输力的现象很严重编辑同志：
    今年上半年，大同市运输公司派了一个有十八辆汽车的车队到怀仁站帮助雁北工业局马口矿运煤。但是这个车队到怀仁以后，在工作中表现得很不好。别的车队每天出勤率至少在百分之八十以上，这个车队的出勤率却平均只有百分之四十六左右；从怀仁站到鹅毛口只有十七里，其它车队的汽车多的往返十四次，平均也在九次左右，而这个车队的汽车每天平均只往返四次。特别是在六月十六日，另外一个车队从怀仁调走了，大同市运输公司的车队不是更好地工作来完成运输任务，反而采取消极怠工的做法，结果拉运量从每天一百二十多吨一下降低到四十多吨。
    为什么这个车队的工作情况这样糟呢？原来这个车队有一部分司机有着严重的雇佣观点，他们认为拉多拉少一样赚钱，就不积极地来完成国家的运输任务。例如有的司机经常借口汽车坏了，就在半途停下来休息，或者到山上去采花玩。有时汽车出了一点小毛病，他们就不出车了。有的司机还故意把零件卸掉，可以借口汽车有了毛病，不出车。
    这种现象之所以能够出现，是因为大同市运输公司领导方面官僚主义作风严重，放弃了对工人的思想教育工作。车队来怀仁以后，四个月中没有召开过一次职工大会，奖罚不明、管理混乱。车队的队长对工人的错误还采取放纵包庇的态度。如不久以前，这个车队的一辆车上的煤还没有卸完，司机杨清生就开动汽车走了；造成了摔伤工人薛政保的人身事故。当时车队长也在车上，他不但没有制止司机的错误做法，反而在事故发生后还命令杨清生驾驶着汽车跑掉。
    应该指出，今年大同市的运输任务十分繁重，缺车很多。五月份雁北工业局所属的八个矿就有峙峰山、杜家沟、小黑沟、二铺等四个矿因为运输力不足，积压了大量的煤运不出去。但是，大同市运输公司对所属汽车队这种浪费运输力的严重现象却熟视无睹，这是十分错误的。
