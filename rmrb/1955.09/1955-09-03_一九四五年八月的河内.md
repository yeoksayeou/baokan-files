Hanoi in August 1945

By Xin Gang, Reporter for the Vietnamese "People's Daily"

　　When recalling the days of August 1945, every Vietnamese remembers the most glorious period of their life. In Hanoi, just like in every place in Vietnam, the people experienced some painful and intensely struggling days. Millions of people, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, filled with hatred and hope, excitedly charged forward in that unprecedented revolutionary high tide.

　　Thinking back to Hanoi in August 1945, I cannot help but recall the extremely painful days in Hanoi before the revolution. Up to 1945, Hanoi had experienced sixty years of enslavement by French colonists, six years of war, and five years of occupation by Japanese fascists. The situation in the spring of 1945 was the most desolate; the cold lingered for a long time, which was a particularly cold weather that Vietnam had never experienced. People's clothes were patched all over, front and back. There was no cloth, and many people lived by wearing burlap sacks. Temporary, drafty thatched huts were built on the ruins. People without homes had to sleep in the market. There were air raid alarms every night; mothers held their babies and crawled into air raid shelters; they had neither mats nor quilts. Groups of starving farmers poured into Hanoi, thinking they could survive by reaching the city. Many died halfway before even seeing the city's sunlight. Those who dragged their skeletons to Hanoi were only waiting to starve to death. On nights when the north wind blew, ox carts carried the corpses of those who had starved to death to the suburbs. Famine, that terrible famine in the northern plains in 1945, spread sin everywhere in the streets of Hanoi. Throughout the winter, Hanoi was worried about rice. Every family was anxious: Rice! Rice! Rice! Where is the rice? In those years, rice had always been under control; one needed a colonist's food certificate to obtain rice. On January 1, 1945, rice was further controlled. Where did all the rice go? Rice, meat, and other fresh and delicious foods were piled up like mountains in the Japanese invaders' large military supply depots, and transported time and again to various battlefields in Southeast Asia. Extremely hungry Hanoi, along with the whole country, roared with anger, demanding food, clothing, independence, and freedom. The people's hearts yearned for change, like a great drought longing for rain clouds.

　　The spring of 1945 was also a spring filled with hope. The Vietnamese people saw the dawn on the horizon in the darkness. Every time the Soviet army launched a victorious counter-offensive, the Vietnamese people cheered from the bottom of their hearts. The victory at Ying, the victory at Fei Ke. Revolutionary fervor swept across the nearby rural areas. Hanoi itself felt that its strength was greater than ever before. Since the fascists murdered Comrade Huang Wen Shu, the leader most beloved by the Vietnamese people and the people of Hanoi, in May of the previous year, the French and Japanese imperialists had carried out one terrorist massacre after another. The French colonists' prisons and the Japanese fascists' gendarmerie headquarters were filled with national salvation fighters. Military tribunals held court one after another. But the people of Hanoi were not discouraged. Inspired by Comrade Huang Wen Shu's heroic and exemplary behavior, the revolutionary fervor in Hanoi surged to unprecedented heights. Every factory, school, and street had a base for the National Salvation Association. On January 6, 1945, Hanoi commemorated the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party; the golden star red flag and leaflets publicizing resistance against the French and expulsion of the Japanese appeared everywhere in the city. Under the astonished gaze of the French military police and the Japanese military police, the golden star red flag was also raised on Turtle Tower. Taking advantage of this important anniversary, the Hanoi Party Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party launched a week-long movement to donate cloth and salt to the Liberation Army and guerrillas in the North Vietnam war zone. The people of Hanoi displayed a high degree of patriotism. Despite being in a state of starvation, they enthusiastically donated clothes, salt, and medicine. The Indochinese Communist Party's "Liberation Flag" newspaper and other national salvation newspapers were widely circulated in Hanoi. The Party's analysis of the situation enabled the people of Hanoi to see clearly that the events unfolding before them would lead to a decisive moment: the French and Japanese were bound to clash. This would be the time for the Vietnamese people to rise up, expel the imperialist forces, and recover the mountains and rivers of their motherland.

　　Nowhere was the coming total crisis of the French and Japanese imperialists seen more clearly than in Hanoi. On March 9, 1945, the Party's prediction was confirmed. The Japanese army overthrew French rule in one night. The Rising Sun flag was raised in Hanoi, but it was a setting sun. The Japanese fascists occupied the city of Hanoi, but they never managed to occupy the hearts of the people of Hanoi. Hanoi watched them with cold, suspicious, and hateful eyes. Pro-Japanese elements paraded with the three-star yellow flag and the Rising Sun flag, shouting "Imperial Army," shouting "Vietnamese Independence," but only three or five hired hooligans followed them, while the streets were deserted on both sides. Some houses in Hanoi had red-letter slogans posted at their doors: "Long Live the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere! Long Live Vietnamese Independence!" Inside the doors, however, were only the corpses of starving people.

　　It was at that time that red paper yellow character slogans appeared everywhere, calling on people: The time has come, quickly prepare for the general uprising. Leaflets exposing the Japanese fascists and pro-Japanese factions by the Vietnam Independence League were scattered everywhere. The Party's and National Salvation Movement's newspapers were almost openly circulated. The Party's instruction on "The Franco-Japanese Conflict and Our Actions" clearly pointed out the road to preparing for the uprising. The situation became more tense day by day. Fascist Germany was finished. The Soviet army liberated Berlin. The European anti-fascist war was won! In the East, the Japanese fascists were slowly retreating and no longer spoke of "strategic withdrawal." In North Vietnam, a liberated area had been established, including six provinces. Various armed forces had been unified into the Vietnam Liberation Army. Hanoi gazed at the San Dao mountain range and paid tribute to the new motherland. News of victories from various war zones spread throughout Hanoi. In the rural areas of the entire middle reaches region and the rural areas near Hanoi in the northern plains, the movement to resist taxes and seize grain from Japanese granaries to distribute to the starving people surged, its power and might unstoppable. Rural power was completely in the hands of the National Liberation Committee and the People's Revolutionary Committee.

　　Hanoi stepped up preparations. Worker shock brigades and youth shock brigades were established one after another. In various base areas outside the city, there were many military and political training classes to train fighters preparing for the uprising. The people's armed forces launched a movement to disarm the Japanese army at various small strongholds and to disarm scattered Japanese officers and soldiers. There were also many courageous guerrilla activities in the Hanoi urban area. Brave Hanoi, mass movements surged, and various national salvation organizations grew tenfold, twentyfold. Japanese bandits searched people's homes, arrested people, and dragged ropes to stop and search pedestrians every day, but when everyone was a "Viet Minh," how could they catch the "Viet Minh"? The Vietnam Independence League directly carried out the work of eliminating traitors in Hanoi. Some shock propaganda teams of the Vietnam Independence League carried out activities in front of the Japanese army's guns. The golden star red flag openly appeared everywhere in the urban area, inserted on trams going back and forth, and openly inserted on the top of Turtle Tower. At the gates of factories, at various markets, at theaters and cinemas, wherever crowds gathered, Vietnam Independence League fighters publicly called on people to prepare for the uprising under the protection of the masses. The golden star red flag was deeply imprinted in the minds of the masses. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam became everyone's hope and belief. Every morning, Hanoi looked forward to a change, looked forward to a revolution, looked forward to an uprising, and actively prepared for the early arrival of this day.

　　During those earth-shattering days of August, when the Soviet army opened fire on the Japanese fascists' Kwantung Army, Hanoi and the whole of Vietnam shouted: "We are preparing here!" Japan surrendered. Vietnamese people's leader Nguyen Ai Quoc (this was the name used by President Ho Chi Minh at the time - editor's note) pointed out: "The time to determine our nation's destiny has come. Compatriots throughout the country, rise up and liberate yourselves with our own strength." The headquarters of the Vietnam Independence League called out: "Arise! The moment of the general uprising has arrived! This is the time for our nation to rise up and strive for its own independent rights!" The Liberation Army liberated Taiyuan and was continuing south. Around Hanoi, the people of Beining, Beijiang, Fu'an, Xing'an, and Hedong rose up. Revolutionary blood had already been shed in Taiyuan, Dongying (Fu'an), and Beining. Hanoi waited feverishly for decisive action.

　　On August 17, 1945, just as the French de Gaulle government declared that it would return to Indochina and continue its colonial rule, 150,000 people held a rally in the square of the Hanoi Grand Theater, demanding the overthrow of colonialism and fighting for the complete independence of the Vietnamese nation. At that moment, the golden star red flag fluttered up, and the appearance of the red flag turned the podium into a sea of red. When the flag they believed in rose, 150,000 people applauded enthusiastically, and cheers of "Support the Viet Minh" shook the square. All of Hanoi was waiting for this moment to express all its revolutionary enthusiasm, to express its wishes to the Party and the Vietnam Independence League Front. National salvation fighters, in front of loudspeakers, called on the people to rise up and participate in the upcoming general uprising. Responding to the call of the Vietnam Independence League, millions of people shouted in unison: "Vietnamese Independence! Long Live the Viet Minh!" A company of security soldiers sent by the Japanese army to suppress the meeting also turned their guns around, raised their hands, and followed the masses in shouting slogans. 150,000 people followed the flag of the Vietnam Independence League and paraded and demonstrated in the streets of the city. More and more people joined along the way, and the masses on both sides of the street applauded enthusiastically to welcome them. Firecrackers were set off in many places to express their welcome. It was raining heavily, but the long parade continued to move forward enthusiastically. It was not until 9:00 in the evening that the masses and revolutionary-minded soldiers dispersed after holding a flag salute. That night and the next day, all day and night, Hanoi enthusiastically prepared for the general uprising.

　　On the morning of August 19th, Hanoi was a sea of golden star red flags. Another mass rally of 200,000 people was held in the square of the Hanoi Grand Theater, with worker shock brigades, youth shock brigades, and peasant combat self-defense teams from outside the city armed to protect the venue. Representatives of the Vietnam Independence League called out: Immediately establish the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam so that the people can seize power and decide their own destiny. The Vietnamese People's Revolutionary Government will announce various freedoms and rights enjoyed by all citizens, will improve the people's spiritual and material lives, and will mobilize the nation's strength to defend and consolidate the true independence of the motherland. Only the People's Revolutionary Government has enough prestige and power to realize the common aspiration of the entire Vietnamese nation: independence, freedom, and happiness. Only the People's Revolutionary Government has enough prestige and power to lead the Vietnamese nation to a bright future, commensurate with the Vietnamese nation's magnificent history.

　　Responding to the call of the Vietnam Independence League, 200,000 people shouted from the bottom of their hearts:

　　Down with all invaders who violate Vietnamese independence!

　　Down with the French colonists who attempt to restore their rule in Indochina!

　　Down with the puppet government!

　　Establish the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!

　　Complete independence for Vietnam!

　　Long live national liberation and the success of the revolution!

　　Amid the music of the "March Forward" song filled with revolutionary will, the people's队伍 were divided into two routes and set off to occupy the administrative and military organs of the northern puppet government. At the Northern Mansion - the location of the northern puppet government - three companies of puppet soldiers were transferred to resist the revolution. But the soldiers, with weapons erected in the courtyard displaying five puppet flags, opened the door to welcome the revolutionary army. At the security guard barracks, the Japanese army dispatched tanks to prevent the people from entering and looting the armory. The soldiers inside the barracks responded to the people's revolutionary actions. The powerful force of the masses forced the Japanese tanks to retreat. The armory in the barracks was immediately distributed to the workers' self-defense force.

　　The people became the masters of Hanoi.

　　On those celebratory banners celebrating the victory of the revolution, which sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain, people proudly saw their golden star red flag alongside the Soviet Union's glorious national flag, and aligned with the flags of the victorious Allied countries.

　　The liberation of Hanoi shocked the country. On August 20th, the Northern People's Revolutionary Committee was established in Hanoi. On August 22nd, the uprising in Shunhua occurred, followed by Bao Da's abdication. On August 25th, one million compatriots in Saigon and Di'an rose up and established the Southern Administrative Committee. The National Congress, which convened in the Xinchao area of the Liberated Zone, elected the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by President Ho Chi Minh. On August 29th, the Liberation Army entered Hanoi amidst the cheers of the masses. On September 2, 1945, simultaneously with the throwing of piles of fascist flags on Red Square in Moscow, the golden star red flag was raised in Ba Dinh Square. 500,000 people welcomed President Ho and the first government of the new Vietnam. Vietnam's revolutionary mentor and the founder of the new Vietnam read the "Declaration of Independence." 500,000 people made an oath of independence before the great leader. From north to south, 23 million compatriots facing Hanoi, swore eternal loyalty to the motherland, forever following President Ho and the Party, and fighting for freedom, independence, and happiness.

　　Ten years have passed.

　　The Vietnamese people have shown that they are loyal to this oath.

    一九四五年八月的河内
    越南“人民报”记者　新钢
    回忆一九四五年八月的那些日子，每个越南人都想起自己生命中最光荣的一段历史。在河内，也像在全越南的每一个地方一样，人民经历了一些痛苦的、剧烈斗争的日子。几百万人在印度支那共产党的领导下，充满着仇恨和希望，在那史无前例的革命高潮中，激动地冲向前去。
    回想一九四五年八月的河内，我不禁忆起河内在革命前的那种极度痛苦的日子。到一九四五年为止，河内经历了法国殖民者六十年的奴役、六年的战争和日本法西斯五年的占领。一九四五年春天的景况最凄凉，寒冷一直拖长着，这是越南从未有过的特别寒冷的天气。人们的衣服前前后后都打满了补钉。没有布，许多人披着麻袋过日子。废墟上临时搭起一些空洞洞的茅屋。没有房子住的人只好睡在市场里。每夜都有警报，母亲们抱着婴儿钻进防空洞，他们没有席子也没有棉被。饥饿的农民一群群地拥进河内，以为到了城市就能够活下去。许多人还没有看见城市的阳光就死在半路上了。那些拖着自己的骨架到达河内的人们，也只是等待着饿死。当北风吹刮的夜晚，牛车满载着饿死者的尸体走向郊区。饥荒，一九四五年北部平原的那一场可怕的饥荒，在河内街头到处撒布着罪孽。河内，在整个冬天，一直为了米发愁。每一家人都惶惶然：米！米！米！米呢？米呢？那几年米一直被统制着，要有殖民者的粮食证才能领到米。一九四五年一月一日，米被进一步统制。米都到哪里去了？米、肉和其他新鲜味美的食物像山一样堆积在日本侵略者的大军需库里，一次又一次地运送到东南亚各战场去。极度饥饿的河内，和全国一同发出要求吃饭、穿衣和独立自由的怒吼。人心要求变革，犹如大旱之望云霓。
    一九四五年的春天也是充满着希望的春天。越南人民在黑夜里看到了天边的曙光。每一次苏军反攻胜利，越南人民都从心底里发出欢呼。那银的胜利，费喀的胜利。附近的农村到处卷起革命的热潮。河内本身感觉到自己的力量比过去任何时候都强大了。自从头年五月，法西斯主义者杀害了越南人民和河内人民最热爱的领袖黄文树同志以后，法国和日本帝国主义者接连地进行一次又一次的恐怖屠杀。法国殖民者的监狱和日本法西斯的宪兵部关满了救国战士。军事法庭一次又一次地开庭。但河内人民没有气馁，受到黄文树同志的英勇模范行为的鼓舞，河内的革命热潮空前高涨。所有的工厂、学校和街道都有救国会的基础。一九四五年一月六日，河内纪念印度支那共产党成立十五周年，金星红旗和宣传抗法驱日的传单在市区内到处出现。在法国军警和日本宪兵惊愕的注视之下，龟塔上也升起了金星红旗。趁着这个重大的纪念日，印度支那共产党的河内党委发动为北越战区的解放军和游击队捐献布匹和食盐一周运动。河内人民发扬了高度爱国精神，侭管处在饥饿的境况下，他们仍然踊跃地捐出衣服、食盐和药品。印度支那共产党的“解放旗报”和其他一些救国报刊在河内广泛地流传。党对形势的分析使河内人民能够看清楚，眼前发生的事情将引导到一个决定性的时机：法、日必然发生冲突。这将是越南人民起来驱逐帝国主义势力和收复祖国河山的时机。
    没有什么地方比河内看得更清楚，法、日帝国主义者政治上的总危机即将到临。一九四五年三月九日，党的预见被证实了。日军在一个晚上把法国的统治推翻了，河内升起了太阳旗，但这是一面日落西山的太阳旗。日本法西斯主义者占领了河内这座城市，但他们始终没有能占领河内的人心。河内用
  一双冷淡、怀疑和憎恨的眼睛望着他们。亲日分子扛着三星黄旗和太阳旗游行，高呼“皇军”，高呼“越南独立”，但是只有三、五个被雇用的流氓跟在他们后面，而街道两旁却是冷清清的。河内的一些住宅门口贴着红字标语：“大东亚共荣圈万岁！越南独立万岁！”门内却只有饥民的死尸。
    就在那个时候，到处出现红纸黄字标语，号召人们：时机已到，迅速准备总起义。越南独立同盟揭露日本法西斯和亲日派的传单到处散发着。党和救国运动的报刊几乎是公开地传递着。党的“法、日冲突和我们的行动”的指示明确指出了准备起义的道路。情况一天比一天紧张。法西斯德国完了。苏军解放柏林。欧洲反法西斯战争胜利了！在东方，日本法西斯慢慢地退却，已不再说什么“战略撤退”了。在北越，解放区已经成立，包括六个省份。各种武装力量已经统一组成越南解放军。河内遥望着三岛群山，向新的祖国致敬。各战区的胜利消息传遍河内。整个中游地区的农村和北部平原上河内附近的农村，抗税和抢夺日军谷仓粮食分给饥民的运动高涨，它的力量和威势什么都不能阻挡。乡村的政权完全掌握在民族解放委员会和人民革命委员会的手中。
    河内加紧准备。工人突击队、青年突击队相继成立。在城外的各处根据地，有许多军事和政治训练班，训练准备起义的战士。人民武装纷纷展开一种运动：解除各小据点的日军的武装，解除零散出来的日本官兵的武装。就在河内市区，也有许多勇敢的游击活动。勇敢的河内，群众运动高涨，各种救国团体发展了十倍、二十倍。日本强盗搜查民房，抓人，没有一天不拉着绳子拦路搜查行人，但当每一个人都是“越盟”的时候，他们怎能抓到“越盟”呢。越南独立同盟的队伍直接在河内进行除奸工作。越南独立同盟的一些突击宣传队在日军的枪口前进行活动，市区内每一个地方都公开出现金星红旗，插在来回的电车上，公然地插在龟塔顶上。各工厂门口，各处市场，各戏院、电影院，无论那一处群众聚集的地方，越南独立同盟战士都在群众的保卫下公开号召准备起义。金星红旗深深地印在群众的脑海里，越南民主共和国成为每一个人的希望和信仰。每天早晨，河内都期待着一种改变，期待革命，期待起义，并且为这一天的早日到来而积极准备着。
    到了八月的那些惊天动地的日子，当苏军向日本法西斯的关东军开火的时候，河内和越南全国高呼：“我们在这里准备着！”日本投降。越南人民领袖阮爱国（这是胡志明主席当时所用的名字——编者）指出：“决定我们民族命运的时机已到。全国同胞起来，用我们自己的力量解放自己。”越南独立同盟总部号召：“起来！总起义的时刻已到！这是我们民族奋起争取自己的独立权利的时机！”解放军解放了太原，正继续南下。在河内四周，北宁、北江、福安、兴安、河东等地的人民都起来了。革命的鲜血已经洒在太原、东英（福安）、北宁，河内沸腾地等待着决定性的行动。
    一九四五年八月十七日，正当法国戴高乐政府宣称它要回到印度支那，继续其殖民地统治的时候，十五万群众在河内大戏院的广场上举行集会，要求打倒殖民主义，为越南民族的完全独立而斗争。就在这个时候，金星红旗飘扬起来了，红旗的出现使讲坛变成了一片红色。人们所信仰的旗帜升起的时候，十五万人热烈鼓掌，“拥护越盟”的欢呼声震动了广场。全河内都在等待着这个表达它的全部革命热情，表达它对党和越南独立同盟战线的心愿的时刻。救国战士在扩音器前，号召人民奋起参加即将到来的总起义。响应越南独立同盟的号召，千千万万人同声高呼：“越南独立！越盟万岁！”日军派来弹压会场的一连保安兵，也倒转枪头，举手跟着群众高呼口号。十五万人跟着越南独立同盟的旗帜，在市内各街道游行示威。沿途参加的人越来越多，街道两旁的群众热烈鼓掌欢迎。许多地方燃放爆竹表示欢迎。天下着倾盆大雨，漫长的游行队伍仍然继续激昂地前进。直到晚上九点钟，群众和倾向革命的士兵举行了敬旗礼之后才解散。那天晚上和第二天整日整夜，河内热烈准备总起义。
    八月十九日早晨，河内金星红旗一片红。河内大戏院广场上又举行二十万人的群众大会，有工人突击队、青年突击队和城外的农民战斗自卫队武装保卫会场，越南独立同盟代表号召：立即成立越南民主共和国政府，使人民能够掌握政权，决定自己的命运。越南人民革命政府将公布全体国民所享有的各种自由权利，将改善人民的精神和物质生活，并且总动员全国的力量，保卫和巩固祖国的真正独立。只有人民革命政府才有足够的威信和力量实现越南全民族的共同愿望：独立、自由、幸福。只有人民革命政府才有足够的威信和力量领导越南民族走向光明的前途，和越南民族的轰轰烈烈的历史相称。
    响应越南独立同盟的号召，二十万人从心底里喊出：
    打倒一切侵犯越南独立的侵略者！
    打倒企图在印度支那恢复统治权的法国殖民者！
    打倒傀儡政府！
    成立越南民主共和国政府！
    越南完全独立！
    民族解放、革命成功万岁！
    在充满着革命意志的“进军歌”的乐声中，人民的队伍分成两路，出发占领北部傀儡政府的行政机关和军事机关。在北部府——北部傀儡政府所在地，三连傀儡兵被增调来反抗革命。但士兵们在插着五面傀儡旗的院子里架起武器，开门迎接革命军。在保安兵营，日军出动战车阻止人民进去抢劫军火库。营内的士兵却响应了人民的革命行动。群众的强大力量迫使日军的战车撤退。兵营里的军火库的军火立即被分发给工人自卫队。
    人民成为河内的主人。
    在那些一下子像雨后春笋一样出现的庆祝革命胜利的彩牌上，人们自豪地看见自己的金星红旗在苏联的光荣的国旗旁边，和各战胜的盟国的旗帜排列在一起。
    河内解放震动了全国。八月二十日，北部人民革命委员会在河内成立。八月二十二日，顺化起义，接着保大退位。八月二十五日，西贡堤岸的一百万同胞起来，建立南部行政委员会。在解放区新潮地方开会的国民大会，选出了由胡志明主席领导的越南民主共和国临时政府。八月二十九日，解放军在群众的欢呼声中进入河内。一九四五年九月二日，和莫斯科红场上抛下成堆的法西斯旗帜的同时，金星红旗在巴亭广场上升起。五十万人民欢迎胡主席和新越南的第一个政府。越南的革命导师、新越南的创建者宣读“独立宣言”。五十万人在伟大的领袖面前发出独立的誓言。从北到南，二千三百万同胞向着河内，发誓永远忠于祖国，永远跟着胡主席和党，为自由、独立、幸福而奋斗。
    十年过去了。
    越南人民已经显示出他们是忠于这一誓言的。
