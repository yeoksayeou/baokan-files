    Many rivers in Xinjiang are formed by the melting of snow accumulated on high mountains. Every summer, as the snow on the mountain peaks melts, some rivers often flood. In order to gradually grasp the hydrological changes of the major rivers and some major canals within Xinjiang Province, and to provide systematic data for large-scale water conservancy projects in the future, the Xinjiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has established sixty-eight hydrological stations and water level stations with emphasis.
    In the process of establishing these hydrological stations and water level stations in various places, they have received great assistance from the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In addition to assisting the Xinjiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau's Hydrological General Station in establishing seventeen new hydrological stations and water level stations in Turpan, Hami and other places, they have also transferred the operations of their original twenty-five hydrological stations in the Urumqi, Manas River basin and other areas to the unified leadership of the Water Conservancy Bureau.

    新疆建立大批水文站和水位站
    新疆境内许多河流，都是由高山积雪融化后汇集成的。每年夏天，山巅积雪消融，一些河流常常泛滥成灾。新疆省水利局为逐渐掌握各主要河流和部分主要渠道水文变化情况，并为今后大规模兴修水利工程提供系统的资料，已有重点地建立了六十八处水文站和水位站。
    各地在建立这些水文站和水位站时，得到中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队很大的帮助。他们除协助新疆省水利局水文总站在吐鲁番、哈密等地新设了十七处水文站和水位站外，还将他们在乌鲁木齐、玛纳斯河流域等地区原有的二十五处水文站的业务，拨归水利局统一领导。　（新华社）
