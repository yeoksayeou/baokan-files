Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 24th: The Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly began its general political debate on the morning of the 22nd.

The first speaker was Brazil's Freitas Valle. He first pointed out that the Tenth Session of the General Assembly was being held in an atmosphere where the international situation had been considerably eased by the Four Power Summit Conference. He said he believed that the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers' Geneva Conference would further promote trust between nations.

At the same time, the Brazilian representative expressed support for amending the United Nations Charter, particularly abolishing the principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council. Although, as everyone knows, the adoption of this important principle was intended to enable the permanent members of the Security Council to try to reach unanimous agreement when resolving major issues.

The head of the US delegation, US Secretary of State Dulles, then spoke. He said: This session should not only complete the efforts of the United Nations over the past decade, but there are now welcome signs that the next decade may in fact be more harmonious than the first. He added: "Indeed, we are capable of doing so."

Referring to the issue of admitting new member states, Dulles expressed the hope that the Security Council and the General Assembly would take the necessary measures during the Tenth Session to admit all "qualified countries" into the United Nations.

Dulles suggested that the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly discuss the issue of holding a Charter Review Conference. He said: The United States believes that such a conference should be held. A strong reason is to reconsider the current "veto" power on the issue of admitting new member states, especially if this veto power continues to be abused.

In addition, due to the epoch-making developments in atomic energy and disarmament, it may be appropriate to give the organization greater authority on these issues.

Dulles continued: This does not necessarily mean that major revisions should be made. On the whole, the Charter has proven to be a flexible and workable document. But few would consider it a perfect document, not susceptible to improvement.

The United States believes that this conference should agree in principle to convene a Charter Review Conference and establish a preparatory committee to prepare and submit recommendations regarding the date, location, organization, and procedures of the general review conference.

Dulles then turned to the events that had occurred between the last and current sessions. He said: These developments clearly help promote the goals of our Charter—international peace and security—in accordance with the principles of justice and international law.

However, the US representative also listed events such as West Germany's accession to the Brussels Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization among these things. Dulles recounted the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, and then said: Following these developments regarding Germany and Austria, France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States made new efforts to reduce the danger of war and to resolve outstanding issues through negotiation.

This May, the Western three countries suggested a "two-stage" effort. "Stage One" was for the heads of government to meet in person to provide "new impetus" for "Stage Two"; and in "Stage Two" the substance of various issues would be studied in detail.

The first part of this plan was realized in Geneva this July, when the four heads of government met.

They clearly expressed their common desire for peace and improved relations. They specifically agreed to make further efforts on three issues: 1. European security and the German question; 2. Disarmament; 3. Developing contacts between East and West.

Now we are entering the mutually agreed "Stage Two." A subcommittee of the United Nations is already discussing the views on disarmament put forward at the Geneva Conference. The foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States will meet in Geneva next month. Where appropriate, the Western countries will consult with the Federal Republic of Germany and other partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

It has been agreed that the closely linked issues of German reunification and European security will be given priority at the upcoming meeting. This is as it should be.

The German people have now been forced to separate for more than a decade. To allow this state of separation to exist forever is a crime against nature.

Many countries believe that their own future security and world peace urgently require Germany to be reunified, and that, if it is willing, it should be able to participate in Western European arrangements for limiting, supervising, and unifying armed forces, so that they will never serve for aggressive purposes.

There are other countries who say that they believe that even under these conditions, a unified Germany within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would still pose a danger to them.

Dulles said: In order to eliminate this disagreement, the Western countries are prepared to propose some comprehensive European security plan, which will give the Soviet Union more forceful guarantees. This attitude of the Western countries, together with the similar sentiment of the Federal Republic of Germany, provides an unprecedented opportunity. But this sentiment of the Germans that I speak of may not often last. At the same time, it cannot be assumed that the Western countries, including the United States, will often be prepared to expand their existing obligations to accommodate Soviet concerns about European security.

The present opportunity is so unusual, so full of constructive possibilities, that one can hope that the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will find a solid basis for achieving German reunification within the framework of European security.

Dulles again raised the issue of Eastern European countries and "international communism." He said that these "problems" hinder relations between nations and make it difficult for "governments" to establish "truly sincere relationships." Dulles then elaborated on the situation in the Americas, the Near East, and Southeast Asia. He specifically asserted that the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was for "defense."

Dulles said: In the China region, the situation is not as ominous as it used to be. We hope that the People's Republic of China will heed the clear wishes of the world community not to use force to achieve national goals.

At the Bandung Conference site, Mr. Zhou Enlai suggested direct negotiations with the United States. I immediately stated that the United States could accept this suggestion as long as we only discuss issues that concern both of us and do not involve the rights of third parties. As far as the United States is concerned, this reservation applies particularly to the Republic of China, to which we are as loyal as to an old friend and old ally.

About fifteen months ago, the United States began talks with the People's Republic of China in Geneva on the issue of returning our civilians home. Due to Mr. Zhou Enlai's statement in Bandung and my response, the talks resumed in August of this year, first to discuss the release of civilians returning home, and then to discuss other practical issues directly related to both of us.

Dulles then spoke about the peaceful uses of atomic energy. He said:

Last year I spoke about the peaceful uses of atomic energy. We have gone through a disappointing period of negotiations in order to get the Soviet Union to participate in President Eisenhower's plan, which he presented to you on December 8, 1953.

Last September, I mentioned four activities that we guaranteed would begin immediately. Since then, we have made good progress in each of these four areas.

Negotiations on establishing an international atomic energy agency have led to the drafting of regulations for establishing such an agency.

The International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy was held in Geneva last month and achieved remarkable results. The conference was so successful that the United States wants to again suggest holding a similar conference in three years or less, if the growing development of peaceful uses of atomic energy proves this to be appropriate.

The Soviet Union is now taking a more cooperative attitude. We are pleased to note that Premier Bulganin recently promised to provide fissionable material for the proposed international agency to use when it is established.

We see that a lot has happened to make the hopeful picture drawn by President Eisenhower when he spoke at our Eighth General Assembly a reality.

Dulles announced that the United States also intends to propose at this session the establishment of an international technical body to study the effects of atomic radiation on human health. He added: We believe that nuclear tests with proper protective equipment and the development of peaceful uses of atomic energy will not threaten human health or life. But this is a matter of great concern to everyone, so we believe we should find all the information we can get and share it under the auspices of the United Nations.

Dulles turned to the issue of limiting armaments. He recounted President Eisenhower's proposal in Geneva: that the Soviet Union and the United States provide each other with information about their military facilities and give each other the convenience of unrestricted aerial reconnaissance. He said: The logic of this proposal is simple and clear. Unless an aggressor can have the benefit of a surprise attack and be able to hope to carry out an attack that is devastating because it is unexpected, a major aggression is unlikely. But preparations for such an attack on that scale are almost impossible to conceal under aerial inspection.

Of course, aerial inspection will not detect everything, and it cannot in itself constitute a final, comprehensive inspection system. But aerial inspection will detect enough to eliminate the greatest danger.

Therefore, it will pave the way for further steps in inspection and disarmament, which we all—and I emphasize that the United States is included—hope to take.

It is clear from long experience that limiting armaments is virtually impossible when there is a feeling of insecurity and armaments seem necessary. Armaments will only be reduced when fear dissipates and armaments seem less necessary.

I believe everyone immediately senses that if the United States allows the Soviet Union to fly over its territory and the Soviet Union allows the United States to fly over its territory, it would be very sufficient to show that neither country has any intention of aggression against the other. Then, as President Eisenhower pointed out in his request in Geneva, it would be easier to move forward to a comprehensive, scientific system of inspection and disarmament.

The essence of the President's proposal is that, as a beginning, it will be able to do what a beginning requires, which is to make it more possible to take subsequent steps.

I hope that the mood of this General Assembly will show that this beginning should be made as simple and as quickly as possible. After such a beginning, solid progress can and, I believe, will be made in achieving the goal set out in our Charter of reducing "the diversion for armaments of the world's human and economic resources."

Dulles concluded: In the same month ten years ago, the Second World War was declared over. We have not had another world war in the ten years since then. This is something to be deeply grateful for. But we have not achieved true peace. There have been limited wars. Some free countries have been subverted and taken away. Armaments have been stockpiled in large quantities, and strict attitudes have been taken towards those who see each other as potential combat enemies.

This phase may now be coming to an end. I believe that the four heads of government who attended the Geneva Conference hoped for this result, and each contributed to it. As a result, a new spirit has indeed prevailed, there is greater flexibility in international relations, and it is not as fragile as it used to be.

Some people find it interesting to speculate about which countries benefit from this development and which countries are harmed.

I can say that if the "Spirit of Geneva" is to be permanent, the whole world must benefit. If the summit is to be historic, rather than an episode, it must usher in an era of peaceful change.

This will not be an era of tranquility and stagnation in the sense of seeing the status quo and its many injustices as eternal. This will be an era of change, which will have its difficulties and twists and turns. But nations and governments will abandon the use of war and subversion to achieve their goals. They will accept orderly evolution to realize legitimate national aspirations. They will develop broader economic exchanges among themselves. They will have greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Human efforts will be used in creative and benevolent ways.

The United Nations will also change. As long as there is sincerity and mutual trust, many provisions of the Charter will acquire new meaning and new vitality.

Let us work together to make the coming decade a decade of true peace for rest and recuperation.

After Dulles, the representative of Costa Rica, Nuñez, spoke. Nuñez pointed out that since the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation between countries has been strengthened. He expressed the hope that after the emergence of this new situation, economic assistance to underdeveloped countries should be increased.

The Egyptian representative, Fawzi, pointed out: "The General Assembly is being held in an atmosphere characterized by a clear expression of hope for the establishment of world peace," which is the first time in several years. He expressed his warm anticipation for the arrival of a new era of cooperation in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which will eliminate the danger of using force to resolve international disputes, and will firmly establish the rule of law in international relations.

Fawzi called on the General Assembly to pay attention to the fact that colonialism is one of the causes of international tension. He cited the resolution of the Asian-African Conference calling for dependent countries, especially North African countries, to be liberated from colonial oppression.

He opposed amending the United Nations Charter and called for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the establishment of supervision of armaments.

The last speaker at the morning meeting was the Dominican representative, Ordóñez, who supported the proposal to amend the United Nations Charter.

At the afternoon meeting, the representatives of Ecuador and New Zealand spoke.

The head of the Ecuadorian delegation, Trujillo, said that the first issue that the current session should study is the issue of the United Nations admitting new member states. He advocated convening a conference to amend the United Nations Charter and called for increased economic assistance to underdeveloped countries.

The New Zealand representative, T. Macdonald, pointed out that the atmosphere at the opening of the current session was full of hope. He also noted with satisfaction the progress made in discussing the reduction of armaments and armed forces, and called on everyone not to be afraid of all the complexities of this issue, but to continue discussing it. He believed that the United Nations General Assembly should try again to resolve the issue of admitting new members, and believed that convening a conference to amend the United Nations Charter was untimely.

### 十届联大开始一般性政治辩论

    十届联大开始一般性政治辩论
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会第十届会议在二十二日上午开始进行一般性政治辩论。
    第一个发言的是巴西的特里塔斯·瓦利。他首先指出大会第十届会议是在四大国政府首脑会议使得国际局势有了相当大的缓和的气氛中举行的。他说，他相信行将召开的四国外长日内瓦会议会进一步促进国与国之间的信任。
    同时，巴西代表表示赞成修改联合国宪章，特别是赞成废除安全理事会五个常任理事国一致的原则。虽然，大家知道，采纳这个重要的原则是为了要使安全理事会常任理事国在解决重大问题时设法作出一致同意的决定。
    美国代表团团长、美国国务卿杜勒斯接着发言。他说：目前这届会议不仅要完成联合国十年来的努力，而且现在已经有值得欢迎的迹象，表明今后的十年事实上可能会比第一个十年更加和谐。他补充说：“的确，我们是有能力做到这一点的。”
    在谈到接受新会员国的问题时，杜勒斯表示希望在第十届会议期间安全理事会和大会会采取必要的措施，接受一切“合格的国家”进入联合国。
    杜勒斯建议联合国大会第十届会议讨论举行一次宪章审查会议的问题。他说：美国认为应当举行这样的会议。一个有力的理由就是要就接纳新会员国的问题重新考虑目前的“否决”权，特别是如果这种否决权继续被人滥用的话。
    此外，由于在原子能和裁军方面的划时代的发展，使本组织在这些问题上具有更大的权威也许是适宜的。
    杜勒斯接着说：这并不是一定说应该作重大的修改。整个说来，这个宪章已经证明是一份有伸缩性的和切实可行的文件。但是很少有人会认为这是一份完美的文件，而不容予以改善。
    美国认为，这次会议应该在原则上同意召开一次宪章审查会议和成立一个筹备委员会来准备和提出有关一般审查会议的日期、地点、组织和程序的建议。
    杜勒斯转而谈到在上届和本届会议之间发生的事件。他说：这些发展显然有助于按照正义和国际法的原则促进我们的宪章的目标——国际和平和安全。
    但是，这个美国代表把西德加入布鲁塞尔条约和北大西洋公约这种事件也列在这些事情之中。杜勒斯追述了奥地利国家条约的签字，然后说：紧跟着这些关于德国和奥地利的事态发展之后，法国、英国、苏联和美国作出了新的努力，来减少战争危险，并且通过谈判来解决悬而未决的问题。
    今年五月，西方三国建议进行“两个阶段”的努力。“第一阶段”是由政府首脑们亲自举行会议，为“第二阶段”提供“新的推动力”；而在“第二阶段”将详细研究各项问题的实质。
    这个计划的第一部分在今年七月已经在日内瓦实现，四国政府首脑在那时举行了会议。
    他们明确地表示了他们希望和平和改善关系的共同愿望。他们具体地商定在三个问题上作进一步的努力，这三个问题就是：一、欧洲安全和德国问题；二、裁军问题；三、发展东西方之间的接触问题。
    现在我们进入了一致商定的“第二阶段”。联合国的一个小组委员会已经在讨论日内瓦会议上提出的关于裁军的意见。法国、联合王国、苏联和美国的外长将于下月在日内瓦举行会议。在适当情况下，西方国家将使德意志联邦共和国和北大西洋公约组织的其他伙伴同他们联系。
    已经商定在即将到来的会议上优先讨论密切地连在一起的德国重新统一问题和欧洲安全问题。这样做是应当的。
    德国人民到现在已经被迫分离了十年以上。使这种分离状态永远存在下去是一种违反自然的罪行。
    有许多国家认为它们自己未来的安全和世界和平都迫切需要德国重新统一起来，而且，如果它愿意的话，还要使它能够参与西欧的关于限制、监督和统一武装部队的安排，以便使它们绝不会为侵略目的服务。
    还有另外一些国家说，它们认为即使在这种条件下，在北大西洋公约组织内的统一的德国仍然会危害到它们。
    杜勒斯说：为了消除这种分歧，西方国家准备提出某种全面的欧洲安全计划，这种计划将给苏联以更多的有力的保证。西方国家的这种态度同德意志联邦共和国的类似的心情一起提供了一个空前的机会。但是我所说的德国人的这种心情可能不会经常保持下去。同时，也不能设想，西方国家，包括美国在内，会经常准备扩大它们现有的义务，来适应苏联对欧洲安全的关切。
    目前的机会是如此不同寻常，如此充满着建设性的可能性，因此，人们能够希望即将举行的四国外长会议会为在欧洲安全的范围内实现德国的重新统一找到坚实的基础。
    杜勒斯再次提出了东欧国家和“国际共产主义”的问题。他说，这些“问题”妨碍着国与国之间的关系，并且使得“各国政府之间”很难建立“真正诚挚的关系”。杜勒斯接着详细谈到美洲、近东和东南亚的局势。他特别断言建立东南亚条约组织是为了“防御”。
    杜勒斯说：在中国地区，局势已经没有以往那样险恶了。我们希望中华人民共和国会理会世界人士的明白的意愿，不使用武力来实现国家的目的。
    在万隆会议的所在地，周恩来先生建议同美国直接谈判。我随即表示，只要我们仅仅讨论同我们双方有关而不牵涉到第三方面的权利的问题，美国是可以接受这个建议的。就美国来说，这种保留意见特别适用于我们对它像对一个老朋友和老盟友一样忠诚的中华民国。
    大约十五个月以前，美国在日内瓦同中华人民共和国开始了关于使我们的平民回国的问题的会谈。由于周恩来先生在万隆发表的声明和我的答复，在今年八月又恢复了会谈，首先是要讨论释放平民回国的问题，然后讨论同我们双方直接有关的其他实际问题。
  杜勒斯接着谈到原子能用于和平目的的问题。他说：
    去年我曾经谈到和平使用原子能问题。我们已经经历过一段令人失望的谈判的时期，以便促使苏联参加艾森豪威尔总统一九五三年十二月八日向诸位提出的计划。
    去年九月，我曾经提到我们保证立即开始进行的四项活动。在那时以后，我们在这四方面的每一方面都有了良好的进展。
    关于建立一个国际原子能机构的谈判已经导致关于建立这种机构的规章草案的拟订工作。
    上月在日内瓦举行了和平利用原子能国际会议，并且取得了卓越的成就。这次会议是如此成功，以致美国要再度建议在三年或不到三年内举行一次类似的会议，如果和平利用原子能的日益发展证明这样做是适当的话。
    苏联现在正在采取一种比较合作的态度。我们愉快地注意到布尔加宁总理最近答应在拟议中的国际机构成立时拿出可裂变的物质，以供这个机构工作之用。
    我们看到，已经发生了很多事情，使艾森豪威尔总统在我们的第八届大会上发言时所描绘的希望的景象成为现实。
    杜勒斯宣布美国还打算在本届大会上建议设立一个研究原子放射对人类健康的影响的国际技术机构。他又说：我们相信，有适当保护设备的核子试验和原子能的和平使用的发展不会威胁人类的健康或生命。但是，这是一个引起大家这样大大关切的问题，因此，我们认为应当找出一切可以得到的资料，并且在联合国的主持下共同掌握这些资料。
    杜勒斯转而谈到限制军备的问题。他追述了艾森豪威尔总统在日内瓦提出的建议：苏联和美国彼此提供关于自己的军事设施的情报以及让对方有进行不受限制的空中侦察的便利。他说：这个建议的逻辑是简单明了的。除非侵略者能够有进行突袭的好处，并且能够希望进行一种由于是出乎意料因而是毁灭性的打击，否则，重大的侵略是不大可能的。但是这样规模的一次攻击的准备工作在空中视察下是
  几乎无法掩饰的。
    当然，空中视察不会查出一切事情，它本身也不能构成一种最后的、全面的视察制度。但是，空中视察会查出足够的情况，来排除最大的危险。
    因此，它会为在视察和裁军方面采取进一步的步骤打开道路，而我们大家——我着重地把美国也包括在内——都希望能采取这些步骤。
    根据长期的经验可以明显地看到：在有了不安全的感觉因而似乎需要军备的时候，限制军备实际上就不可能办到。只有在恐惧消散和似乎不那么需要军备的时候，才会有军备的裁减。
    我相信，大家都立即感觉得到：如果美国允许苏联在它的领土上空飞行而苏联也允许美国在它的领土上空飞行，那就非常足以表明两国中任何一国对另一国都没有侵略意图。那时，正如艾森豪威尔总统在他在日内瓦提出的请求中所指出的，就比较容易进而实行一种全面的、科学的视察和裁军制度。
    总统的建议的实质是：作为一个开端，这个建议将能做到一个开端所要求的事情，那就是要使得更加有可能去采取以后的各项步骤。
    我希望，本届大会的情绪将表明这个开端应该作得尽可能简单和尽可能快。在这样一个开端以后，就能够，而且我相信也一定会，在实现我们的宪章所规定的减少“世界人力经济资源之消耗于军备”的目标方面取得坚实的进展。
    杜勒斯最后说：在十年前的上一个月，第二次世界大战宣告结束了。我们在那时以后的十年的生活中没有发生另一次世界大战。这是值得深深庆幸的事情。但是我们并没有实现真正的和平。一直都有规模有限的战争。有些自由国家遭到了颠覆，并且被夺过去了。军备在大量地储存起来了，而且，对于那些彼此看成潜在的战斗敌人的人采取了严厉的态度。
    这个阶段现在可能就要结束。我相信，参加日内瓦会议的四国政府首脑都希望得到这个结果，而且每个人都为此作出了贡献。结果，的确是有一种新的精神占了优势，在国际关系中有了较大的灵活性，而且也没有以前那样脆弱了。
    有些人觉得这样猜测一下是很有趣的：这种局势的发展究竟对哪些国家有利，又对哪些国家有害？
    我可以说，如果要“日内瓦精神”成为永久的，获益的必须是全世界。最高级会议如果要成为历史性的，而不是一种插曲，那就必须引进一个和平改变的时代。
    这将不是把现状以及它的许多不公平现象看成是万古长存的这种意义的平静和停滞的时代。这将是一个变化的时代，它将有它的艰难曲折。但是各国人民和政府将放弃使用战争和颠覆手段来达到他们的目的。他们将接受有秩序的演变，来实现正当的民族愿望。他们将在他们中间发展更为广泛的经济来往。他们将更加尊重人权和基本自由。人类的努力将用在创造性的和仁慈的方面。
    联合国也将改变。只要有诚意和相互信任，宪章中的许多条款就会获得新的意义和新的活力。
    让我们共同努力，使得未来的十年成为休养生息的真正和平的十年罢。
    在杜勒斯之后发言的是哥斯达黎加代表努涅斯。努涅斯指出，自从联合国大会第九届会议以来，国与国之间互相信任和合作的精神已经加强了。他表示希望在出现这种新的局面以后应当增加对落后国家的经济援助。
    埃及代表法齐指出：“大会是在具有明确表示希望建立世界和平的特色的气氛中举行的”，这种情况在最近若干年中还是第一次。他表示热烈期待一个本着联合国宪章精神进行合作的新时代的到来，这种合作将杜绝使用武力来解决国际争端的危险，并且将巩固地建立起在国际关系方面遵守法律的规则。
    法齐要求大会注意这个事实：殖民主义是造成国际紧张局势的原因之一。他引述了亚非会议要求使附属国，首先是北非国家，从殖民主义压迫下得到解放的决议。
    他反对修改联合国宪章，并且要求禁止核子武器和建立对军备的监督。
    在上午会议上最后发言的是多米尼加代表奥多内斯，他支持修改联合国宪章的建议。
    在下午会议上，厄瓜多尔代表和新西兰代表发了言。
    厄瓜多尔代表团团长特鲁希略说，本届会议应当研究的第一个问题，是联合国接纳新会员国的问题。他主张召开修改联合国宪章的会议，并且要求增加对落后国家的经济援助。
    新西兰代表托·麦克唐纳指出本届会议开幕时的气氛是充满希望的。他还满意地指出在讨论裁减军备和武装部队问题上取得的进展，并且号召大家不要怕这个问题的所有复杂性，而继续讨论这个问题。他认为联合国大会应当再次试图解决接纳新会员的问题，并且认为，召开会议修改联合国宪章是不合时宜的。
