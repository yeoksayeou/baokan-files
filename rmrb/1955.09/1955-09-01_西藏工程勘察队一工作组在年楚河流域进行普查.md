A working group of the Tibet Engineering Survey Team is conducting a general survey in the Nyang Chu River basin.

The Nyang Chu River flows through the cities of Shigatse and Gyantse, and the area along both banks of the river is one of the main agricultural regions of Tibet. The working group will survey the source of this river in this area, investigate water conservancy resources, collect data on flood control, irrigation, navigation, and small-scale hydropower generation, conduct measurement and design of some irrigation systems along the coast, and also conduct a preliminary investigation of the mineral resources in this area.

Not long ago, the Shigatse working group of the Tibet Engineering Survey Team completed more than 250 kilometers of topographic and geological survey work on the Yarlung Zangbo River from Shigatse to Quxu, and has obtained preliminary data for future development of water conservancy work in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River.

    西藏工程勘察队一工作组在年楚河流域进行普查
    西藏工程勘察队日喀则工作组正在年楚河流域进行普查。
    年楚河流经日喀则和江孜两市，沿河两岸是西藏主要农业区之一。工作组将在这个地区踏勘这条河流的发源地，调查水利资源，搜集防洪、灌溉、航运和小型水力发电等资料，对沿岸的部分灌溉系统进行测量设计，同时，对这个地区的矿藏也进行初步调查。
    不久以前，西藏工程勘察队日喀则工作组曾在雅鲁藏布江日喀则到曲水一段，完成了二百五十多公里的地形、地质的踏勘工作，已为将来开发雅鲁藏布江中游地区的水利工作取得了初步资料。（新华社）
