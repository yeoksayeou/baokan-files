    Prefabricated Bungalows
    Liao Yulong
    Recently, forty-five new prefabricated bungalows have appeared in Guang'anmen Inner, Xuanwu District, Beijing. These were successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Real Estate Administration based on the rationalization proposals of technicians Wang Junqing and Zhang Yucheng.

    The structure of this prefabricated bungalow is very simple. The frame of the house is wooden, the walls are made of prefabricated cinder concrete panels, bamboo frames and purlins, covered with asbestos tiles, the inner walls are plastered with lath, a gray ceiling, glass doors and windows, and a cinder floor. The frame of this type of house is relatively small and can be made using old and small timber. Other building materials are also very cheap, so the cost is very low, only 26.4 yuan per square meter for labor and materials. This type of house is also quick to build. It takes fourteen or fifteen days to build an ordinary brick-wood-tile bungalow of the same size, but with prefabricated components prepared, it only takes eight to ten days to assemble one of these houses. Because the assembly components have been prefabricated, on-site construction management is also much simpler than building ordinary brick-wood-tile bungalows. Because the walls of this type of house are thinner, the usable indoor area of a house with a construction area of 17 square meters is about 1 square meter larger than that of a typical brick-wood-tile bungalow. Another advantage of this type of house is that it can be moved. Except for the foundation and interior partitions, the entire house can be dismantled and reassembled in another location.

    This type of house is not only simple and cheap, but also quite sturdy, with an estimated service life of up to fifteen years. Each house has glass doors and windows at the front, and a large or two small glass windows at the back, providing ample light and ventilation. There is a corridor outside the house. It is even more elegant than the average old-fashioned brick-wood-tile bungalow. The houses are arranged in one-room and two-room units, each with a construction area of 17.6 square meters, and all are equipped with electric lights. They are suitable for ordinary families to live in.

    The disadvantage of this type of house is that the walls are thin and the insulation is poor. On the hottest days, the indoor temperature is one or two degrees (Celsius) higher than that of ordinary brick-wood-tile bungalows, and it is estimated that the problem will be even greater in winter. The Beijing Real Estate Administration is now actively researching, preparing to add a layer of sawdust under the roof and fill some insulation material in the wall panels. It is estimated that this problem can be solved.

    装配式的平房
    廖玉龙
    北京市宣武区广安门内，最近出现了四十五间新型的预制装配式平房。这是北京市房地产管理局根据技术工人汪俊卿、张玉琛的合理化建议试制成功的。
    这种预制装配式平房的构造很简单，房子的骨架是木制的，墙身用预制的焦渣混凝土板砌成，竹架、竹檩，上盖石绵瓦，里墙用板条抹灰，灰顶棚，玻璃门窗，焦渣地面。这种房屋的骨架较小，可以利用旧木料和小木料来做，其他建筑材料也很便宜，所以造价很低，每平方公尺的工料费只需二十六元四角。这种房子盖起来也很快，建造一间同样大小的普通砖木瓦平房需要十四、五天，建造这种房屋，预制构件备齐后，只要八天到十天就可以装配一间。因为装配构件已经预先做好，现场施工管理也比建造普通的砖木瓦平房简单得多。这种房子的墙身较薄，因此一间建筑面积十七平方公尺的房屋，室内的使用面积比一般的砖木瓦平房约大一平方公尺。这种房屋还有一个优点是可以移动，除地基和室内隔墙外，全部房屋都可以拆到其他的地方重新装配。
    这种房屋不仅简单、便宜，而且相当结实，使用年限预计可达十五年。每间房子的前面都有玻璃门窗，后面也有一个大的或两个小的玻璃窗，光线充足，空气通畅。房子外面有一道走廊。比一般的旧式砖木瓦平房还要大方。房屋的安排，有一间的，有两间的，每间的建筑面积是十七点六平方公尺，里边都装有电灯。适宜一般家庭居住。
    这种房屋的缺点，就是墙身较薄，保温较差。最热的天，室内温度要比普通的砖木瓦平房高一两度（摄氏），估计冬天问题还大。北京市房地产管理局现在正积极研究，准备在屋顶下面加一层锯末，在墙板当中填一些保温材料，估计这个问题是可以解决的。
