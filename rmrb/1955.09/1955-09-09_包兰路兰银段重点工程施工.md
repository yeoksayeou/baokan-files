Construction of key projects on the Lanzhou-Yinchuan section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway—bridge, culvert, tunnel, and roadbed earthwork projects on the Lanzhou to Xingxingwan section—are now in full swing.

The Lanzhou to Xingxingwan section is seventy-two kilometers long, and the project is arduous and massive. The earthwork alone involves more than 5.9 million cubic meters, along with ten tunnels, three large bridges, sixteen medium and small bridges, and one hundred and fifty-six culvert projects. Tunnel operations inside the tunnels have now been fully launched. By the end of August, the Xingxingwan large tunnel had been excavated to 275 meters. Earthwork has been completed for 2.63 million cubic meters, accounting for more than 44% of the total project. In the earthwork projects, the largest sections, spanning 20 kilometers in Donggangzhen, Jianshuigou, and Changchuanzi, utilize large-scale machinery and light rail flatcars in coordination for construction. The Changchuanzi mechanized road construction team employs a large number of bulldozers and scrapers, completing 10,000 cubic meters per day, replacing the manual labor of 3,000 people. Eighty-six culvert projects have already commenced. At the Yellow River Bridge project, steel arch frames are being erected on Pier No. 2 and the bridge abutment in the Lanzhou direction.

    包兰路兰银段重点工程施工
    包兰铁路兰（州）银（川）段的重点工程——兰州到猩猩湾一段桥涵、隧道、路基土石方工程已全面施工。
    兰州到猩猩湾长达七十二公里，工程艰巨浩大，仅土石方工程就有五百九十多万方，还有十座隧道、三座大桥、十六座中小桥及一百五十六处涵管工程。现在隧道工程洞内作业已全面展开，猩猩湾大隧道到八月底掘进已达二百七十五公尺。土石方工程已完成二百六十三万方，占全部工程百分之四十四以上。土石方工程中最大的长二十公里的东岗镇、碱水沟、长川子等地段，都采用了大型机械和轻便道平车互相配合施工。长川子机械筑路队采用了大批推土机、铲运机，一天完成一万方，代替了三千人的体力劳动。涵管工程开工的已有八十六处。黄河大桥工程二号桥墩及兰州方向桥台正架设钢拱架。
