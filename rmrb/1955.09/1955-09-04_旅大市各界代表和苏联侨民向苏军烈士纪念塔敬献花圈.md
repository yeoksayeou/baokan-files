Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, September 3rd: Over 1,200 representatives from all walks of life in Lüda and representatives of Soviet nationals held a rally at Stalin Square at 9:00 a.m. on September 3rd to lay wreaths at the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    Xiao Ke, Vice Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, Liu Jingyu, Deputy Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Shushen, Secretary of the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Song Li, Mayor of Lüda, Yu Guying, Deputy Mayor, and Qiao Chuanjue, President of the Lüda Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, attended the rally.

    Also attending the rally were Belyanov, Soviet Consul General in Dalian, Major General Shmelev and Colonel Koroteev, representatives of the Soviet Far East Command who came from afar, and Colonel Fumin, Acting Military Attaché of the Soviet Embassy in China.

    After the band played the Soviet and Chinese national anthems, Yu Guying, Deputy Mayor of Lüda, spoke at the rally. He first expressed, on behalf of all the people of Lüda, the deepest condolences and sympathy to the Soviet Army martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves for the liberation of Lüda and to their families. Yu Guying said: On August 8, 1945, after the Soviet Union declared war on Japanese fascism, the heroic Soviet army sent troops to the Northeast, and with overwhelming force, annihilated the Japanese Kwantung Army and liberated the entire Northeast of our country, thereby assisting our people in achieving the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The great achievements of the Soviet army will be forever recorded in history and will always be remembered in the hearts of the people of Lüda, who were liberated by the Soviet Union and freed from the cruel rule of the Japanese bandits for forty years.

    Belyanov, the Soviet Consul General in Dalian, also spoke at the meeting. He said: Today, the people of the Soviet Union and China are celebrating the glorious and historic day - the tenth anniversary of the victory over Japanese imperialism. Ten years ago, the heroic Soviet army, in accordance with the obligations undertaken in the treaties signed between the Allied countries, sent troops to the Northeast and, together with the Chinese people's army, liberated the people of the Northeast from the enslavement of Japanese imperialism. Today, as we celebrate this great day, we see with pride and satisfaction that the fraternal friendship forged between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China in the war years is even richer and more brilliant today, in the era of peace.

    Representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Lüda also spoke at the meeting.

    Finally, to the sound of music, Xiao Ke, Belyanov, Shmelev, Fumin, and representatives from all walks of life in Lüda laid wreaths at the Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Tower. All those present observed a moment of silence. The meeting was then declared adjourned.

    At the same time as this meeting was being held, people from all walks of life in Lushun and Jin County also held commemorative rallies in front of the local Soviet Army Martyrs Memorial Towers, laid wreaths at the Soviet Army Martyrs Towers, and went to the tombs of the Soviet Army martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of the Northeast region and Lüda to sweep the tombs.
