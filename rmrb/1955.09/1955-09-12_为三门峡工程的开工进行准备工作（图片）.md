Preparations are underway for the start of the Sanmenxia Project.

The Sanmenxia is the largest and most important hydraulic hub in the first phase of the Yellow River plan. The comprehensive flood control, power generation, and irrigation project built here is key to harnessing and developing the Yellow River.

After the Sanmenxia Reservoir is completed, its capacity will reach 36 billion cubic meters, second only to the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station reservoir. It plays a decisive role in solving the problem of flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. During periods of water shortage in the Yellow River, the Sanmenxia Reservoir can regulate the minimum flow downstream from 197 cubic meters per second to 500 cubic meters per second, ensuring irrigation water and shipping needs for the areas near the riverbanks in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong. It will also turn the water in the lower reaches of the Yellow River into clear water. The Sanmenxia Hydropower Station can generate 1 million kilowatts of electricity, which can provide a sufficient and inexpensive supply of electricity for the industrial and other needs of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and other places for a considerable period.

At present, in order to support the preparatory work before construction, the survey of the railway special line and the exploration of building materials are being accelerated. Many units are actively producing, strengthening various tasks, and assigning technical personnel to support this huge project.

The area of the Sanmenxia Reservoir is about 2,350 square kilometers. The topographic survey of the reservoir area is being actively carried out. More than 1,500 staff members participating in this large-scale surveying work have launched a labor competition in order to complete the delivery of the map in October. This is Group 3 of Detail Survey Team 3 (Youth Commando Team) working on the bank of the Yellow River near Sanmenxia.

The Yellow River Conservancy Commission's Machinery Repair Factory has produced and processed many Yellow River control equipment and products to support the fundamental Yellow River control project. This is a worker in the lathe shop manufacturing drill bits and drill collar clamps needed for drilling work in Sanmenxia.

The railway special line from the Huixing Station of the Longhai Railway to the Sanmenxia construction site of the Yellow River is being surveyed. This is a line with arduous engineering and very complex technology. This is a geological worker conducting a geological survey of the railway.

The Machinery Engineering Brigade of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is one of the teams preparing for large-scale mechanized construction after the start of the Yellow River control project. This team has a large number of new construction machines. Workers are learning technology and preparing to participate in the great Sanmenxia project. This is an engineer explaining the technical principles of the excavator to the workers.

The Sediment Research Institute of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is actively conducting various scientific experiments for the Sanmenxia project. This is a staff member using the Sanmenxia model to conduct experiments on the maximum flood volume of Sanmenxia.

    三门峡是黄河规划第一期工程中最大最重要的水力枢纽，在这里修建的防洪、发电、灌溉的综合性工程是治理和开发黄河的关键。
    三门峡水库建成后，它的容积可以达到三百六十亿公方，仅次于世界最大的古比雪夫水电站的水库。它对解决黄河下游洪水灾害问题起着决定性作用，三门峡水库在黄河缺水时期，可以把下游的最低流量由一百九十七秒公方调节到五百秒公方，保证下游河南、河北、山东接近河岸地区的灌溉用水和航运所需要的水量，并使黄河下游河水变为清水。三门峡水电站可发电一百万瓩，陕西、山西、河南等地相当时期内在工业和其他方面所需用的电力就可得到充足而廉价的供应。
    目前，为了支援施工前的准备工作，铁路专用线的勘测和建筑材料的勘察都在加紧进行。许多单位正在积极生产、加强各项工作和抽派技术人员来支援这一巨大的工程。
    三门峡水库的面积约为两千三百五十平方公里。库区的地形测量正在积极进行。参加这一大规模测量工作的一千五百多名工作人员为了在十月完成交图任务，开展了劳动竞赛。这是地形三队碎部三组（青年突击组）正在三门峡附近黄河边上工作。
    黄河水利委员会机械修配厂工人生产和加工了许多治黄器材和产品，支援黄河治本工程。这是车工间工人正在制造三门峡进行钻探工作所需的钻头、钻杆箍。
    由陇海铁路会兴车站通往黄河三门峡工地的铁路专用线正在勘测。这是一条工程艰巨的和技术十分复杂的线路。这是地质工作人员在作这条铁路的地质调查。
    黄河水利委员会机械工程大队是为了迎接黄河治本工程开始后大规模机械化施工的队伍之一。这个队拥有大批新式施工机械，工人们正在学习技术，准备参加伟大的三门峡工程。这是工程师正给工人们讲解开山机的技术原理。
    黄河水利委员会泥沙研究所积极为三门峡工程作各种科学试验工作。这是工作人员利用三门峡模型作三门峡最大洪水量的试验。
