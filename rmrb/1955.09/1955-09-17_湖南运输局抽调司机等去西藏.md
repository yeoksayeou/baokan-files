The Hunan Provincial Transportation Bureau has successively transferred more than twenty technicians and drivers to support the construction of Tibet. These technicians and drivers are all production experts and model workers with high political awareness. In the past, they were able to complete national plans on a monthly basis, and some were even advanced producers with 100,000 kilometers of safe driving.

Before these technicians and drivers departed, their respective units held farewell meetings for them. The first group of eighteen drivers who went to Tibet have already arrived at their posts. Recently, they wrote to the Hunan Provincial Transportation Bureau, expressing their determination to overcome difficulties and resolutely complete the transportation tasks. The second group of technicians and drivers going to Tibet will depart from Changsha soon. (Our correspondent in Changsha)

    湖南运输局抽调司机等去西藏
    湖南省运输局先后抽调二十多名技术员、汽车司机支援西藏建设。这些技术员和汽车司机都是政治觉悟较高的生产能手和劳动模范，过去都能按月完成国家计划，有的还是安全行车十万公里的先进生产者。
    这些技术员和司机出发以前，所在单位都为他们举行了欢送会。第一批到西藏去的十八名汽车司机已经到达工作岗位。最近，他们写信给湖南省运输局，表示一定要克服困难，坚决完成运输任务。第二批到西藏去的技术员和汽车司机，最近即将从长沙出发。（本报驻长沙记者）
