Youth Activist Congress Film Week Opens
    The "National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Congress Film Week" opened on the evening of the 31st at the Capital Cinema in Beijing. The film week will be held successively in 20 large and medium-sized cities across the country from September 1st to 15th, screening more than 20 excellent films.
    Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture, spoke at the opening ceremony of the film week. He said that this film week is to welcome and cooperate with the convening of the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Congress, and to carry out a broad and visual education for the youth of the country on loving the motherland, building the motherland, and defending the motherland. Liu Zhiming said: The themes of these films are diverse, and the ideological content is extremely rich. We will be encouraged by these films, and this encouragement will be transformed into strength, prompting each of our young people to work bravely, work hard, and study diligently, determined to be an activist in socialist construction, and contribute all our strength to the country's first five-year plan.
    Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, said: The films screened during the film week portray the heroic images of young people in the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and our country in the struggle to build and defend the motherland. Through the screening of these films, it will surely encourage the spirit of selfless labor, hard work, and overcoming difficulties among the youth of our country, and it will also definitely help the youth of our country to improve their revolutionary vigilance and firmness in the struggle against the enemy. At the same time, we very much hope that when the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Congress is convened again next time, and the film week is held again, there will be more feature films and documentaries with the theme of young socialist construction activists in our country.

He said: Each of our young people must learn from the heroic images in the movies, work bravely, study hard, overcome all difficulties, and contribute all our strength in completing and overfulfilling the first five-year plan and in the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.
