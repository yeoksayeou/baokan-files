    Hubei Province’s Areas Heavily Hit by Disaster Last Year Experience a Bumper Harvest This Year; Farmers Eagerly Sell Grain
    Large Quantities of New Cotton from Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces Enter the Market with Good Quality
    According to our newspaper, farmers in Hubei Province who have achieved a bumper harvest are actively selling their new grain to the state. The amount of new grain entering the market is increasing daily. In mid-August, the daily amount entering the market across the province was around 10 million jin, but by the end of August, it had increased to more than 18 million jin. Farmers in areas that suffered disasters last year are using the proceeds from selling new grain to purchase production and daily necessities. Local primary markets are gradually becoming more active due to the abundant rice harvest.
    Before the new grain entered the market, grain departments in various locations rationally adjusted the purchasing points. Because this year's bumper harvest in areas heavily affected by disasters last year has led to great enthusiasm among the masses for selling grain, the existing warehouses were insufficient. Local grain departments immediately adopted measures such as adjusting the capacity of existing warehouses and collecting and transporting grain simultaneously to ensure that grain is received as soon as it arrives, without delaying farmers' production.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, this year's more than ten million mu of cotton in Jiangsu Province is generally growing strong and healthy, with the maturity period advanced by about twenty days compared to last year. Currently, the amount of new cotton entering the market is gradually increasing, and purchasing work by supply and marketing cooperatives in various locations has begun. According to inspections at various purchasing stations, most of the new cotton entering the market is of the highest grade, with long fibers, good color, and low moisture content.
    According to our newspaper, new cotton began entering the market in large quantities in Shandong Province in mid-August. At present, the province can purchase about two million jin of new cotton every day, an increase of 60% compared to the average daily purchase volume in mid-September last year, exceeding the cotton purchase volume in the same period in previous years in Shandong Province. The daily purchase volume in Dezhou and Liaocheng Prefectures has doubled compared to the average daily purchase volume in mid-September last year.
    This year, cotton planting in Shandong Province was timely, completing the state plan figures. After planting, inspired by the enthusiasm to support national industrial construction, cotton farmers strengthened cotton field management and pest and disease control. At the same time, the state vigorously provided material support and technical guidance, resulting in good cotton growth this year. Now, many agricultural production cooperatives and farmers in cotton-producing areas, in addition to promptly selling the harvested cotton to the state, are striving to strengthen the later-stage management of cotton fields, strive for a greater cotton harvest, and sell more new cotton to the state.

    湖北省去年重灾区今年丰收农民踊跃售粮
    江苏山东两省新棉大量上市质量良好
    本报讯　湖北省获得丰收的农民，纷纷把新粮卖给国家。新粮上市量逐日增加，八月中旬全省每日上市量还是一千万斤左右，到八月底，便增加到一千八百多万斤。去年受灾地区的农民，在卖出新粮后，纷纷添置生产和生活资料，各地初级市场因稻谷丰收，已逐渐活跃起来。
    各地粮食部门在新粮上市之前，合理地调整了收购点。去年重灾区因为今年丰收，群众卖粮很踊跃，原有的仓库不够用，当地粮食部门即采取调整现有仓库的容量和边收边运等办法，以保证随到随收，不误农民生产。
    据新华社讯　今年江苏省一千多万亩棉花一般发育健壮，成熟期比去年提早二十天左右。现在，新棉上市量正日渐增多，各地供销合作社的收购工作已开始。据各地收购站检验，上市的新棉大部分是上级棉，毛绒长，色泽好，水分少。
    本报讯　八月中旬开始，山东省新棉大量上市。目前全省每天可收购新棉二百万斤左右，比去年九月中旬每天的收购量增加百分之六十，超过山东省历年同期的棉花收购量。德州、聊城两专区每天的收购量比去年九月中旬的平均每天收购量增加一倍。
    今年山东省棉花播种及时，完成了国家计划数字。播种后，棉农在支援国家工业建设的热情鼓舞下，加强了棉田管理和病虫害的防治；同时，国家并大力给予物资支持和技术指导，因而今年棉花生长良好。现在产棉区的许多农业生产合作社和农民，除及时把采摘的棉花卖给国家外，努力加强棉田的后期管理，争取棉花更大丰收，卖更多的新棉给国家。
