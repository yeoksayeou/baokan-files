    The negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany government delegations in Moscow have yielded significant and positive results. The two sides decided to establish diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary. The results of the Moscow negotiations are another important step forward in easing international tensions after the Geneva Four-Power Summit, and a significant contribution to strengthening international friendly cooperation and world peace.
    The friendly cooperation between the Soviet and German people is a crucial key to consolidating peace in Europe and the world. Since the end of World War II, the Soviet Union has consistently been committed to establishing friendly and good-neighborly relations with the German people. The Soviet Union established friendly and close normal relations with the German Democratic Republic long ago, and these relations are constantly developing and consolidating. The Soviet Union has also made persistent efforts to promote the establishment of normal relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. The Moscow negotiations were held at the initiative of the Soviet Union. During the negotiations, although the views of the two sides differed in many respects, the Soviet Union always held one purpose—to establish friendly relations between the two countries and to ensure world peace. During the talks, Khrushchev, a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, pointed out: "One of the goals of the Soviet government is to ensure world peace. We do not want to find other ways besides establishing friendly relations, and we do not want the spearhead of this relationship to be directed at other countries—Britain, France, the United States, or any other country." This vividly demonstrates the fundamental direction of Soviet foreign policy: to strive to expand friendly cooperation with all countries with different social systems, and to strengthen world peace and security. The success of this negotiation is a new victory for Soviet peaceful diplomacy.
    The Moscow negotiations not only laid the foundation for future friendly cooperation between the two countries, but also have significant implications for easing tensions in Europe and the world. As the final communiqué of the negotiations pointed out: "The two delegations agreed that the establishment of diplomatic relations will help develop mutual understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, to the benefit of peace and European security." People cannot fail to see that certain national groups have been trying to use the gap in the normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany to spread hostility and hatred, attempting to create and deepen distrust between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in order to profit from it. This plan harbors the danger of a new war in Europe and seriously threatens the security of the European people and world peace. From this, it is not difficult to see the significant impact that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and their understanding and cooperation, will have on the easing of tensions in Europe. This influence will undoubtedly play a very beneficial role in consolidating peace in Europe and the world. Therefore, people have sufficient reason to believe that the result of the Moscow negotiations is an unusual victory for international peace forces. It is beneficial to the Soviet people and the German people, and to all good people in the world.
    In order to obstruct the success of the negotiations, some people had already delineated the "scope" of the Moscow negotiations before the negotiations even began, and asserted that the negotiations "would not yield any results." During the negotiations, some Western journalists continued to spread pessimistic sentiments, repeatedly claiming that the negotiations "had reached a deadlock." Now, after the results of the negotiations have been announced, they are trying to downplay its significance and are even suggesting that the the establishment of diplomatic relations will be delayed and hindered. Needless to say, the purpose of their approach is to prevent the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, thereby undermining the progress of international cooperation. However, the facts have proved that their attempts have failed; the facts will continue to prove that their attempts will continue to fail. The Soviet Union's efforts to seek the normalization of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and its firm stance in the negotiations have won the praise and support of peace-loving people all over the world. The German people, especially the people of West Germany, widely demand the establishment of normal relations with the Soviet Union. The will of the people is irresistible; the plan to undermine the spirit of international cooperation and understanding formed at the Geneva Conference has been disrupted. This once again powerfully proves that the mainstream of the current international situation is, after all, moving towards easing tensions.
    The frank and open attitude of both sides in the Moscow negotiations has left a deep impression. Both sides stated their views and positions frankly and without reservation. This frank statement enabled both sides to better understand each other's attitudes and greatly promoted the success of the negotiations. This shows that in negotiations seeking to resolve pressing international problems, as long as the parties concerned truly proceed from reality and are able to act in a spirit of mutual understanding, they can always find a way to reach an agreement. Those who adopt a policy of "proceeding from a position of strength" can only fail, and this policy is no longer viable.
    The Chinese people warmly welcome the results of the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Chinese people have always had friendly relations with the German people. The two peoples once had close economic ties and cultural exchanges. This exchange has been greatly strengthened and developed in the close and friendly relations between China and the German Democratic Republic. In order to further develop friendly cooperation between the Chinese people and all the German people, and in order to strive for and consolidate lasting world peace, the Chinese people believe that the time has come to establish normal relations between the People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of Germany. The spirit of earnest cooperation in international relations has led to improved relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and according to the same spirit, there is no reason why relations between China and the Federal Republic of Germany cannot be normalized.

### 缓和国际局势的新成就

    缓和国际局势的新成就
    在莫斯科举行的苏联和德意志联邦共和国政府代表团的谈判取得了重大的、积极的结果。谈判双方决定建立两国之间的外交关系，并互派特命全权大使级的外交代表。莫斯科谈判的结果，是继日内瓦四国政府首脑会议之后在缓和国际紧张局势方面的又一重要进展，对于加强国际友好合作和世界和平是一个重要贡献。
    苏德两国人民的友好合作是巩固欧洲和世界和平的重要关键。苏联自第二次世界大战结束以来，就一贯致力于建立同德国人民的友好和睦邻关系。苏联同德意志民主共和国早就建立了友好亲密的正常关系，这种关系正在不断地发展和巩固。苏联为了促进同德意志联邦共和国建立正常关系，也作了坚持的努力。莫斯科谈判就是由于苏联的倡议而举行的。在谈判中，尽管双方的见解在许多方面是不一致的，但是苏联始终抱定一个目的——建立两国之间的友好关系，保障世界和平。苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在会谈中曾指出：“苏联政府的一个目标是——保障世界和平。我们除了建立友好关系以外，不想寻找其他的途径，而且我们不想让这种关系的矛头针对着其他国家——英国、法国、美国或是任何其他国家。”这生动地显示了苏联外交政策的根本方向：为扩大同一切社会制度不同的国家的友好合作，为加强世界的和平和安全而努力。这次谈判的成功是苏联和平外交政策的新的胜利。
    莫斯科谈判不但为两国今后的友好合作奠定了基础，并且也对于和缓欧洲和世界紧张局势有着重大的意义。正如谈判最后公报所指出的：“两国代表团同意，外交关系的建立将有助于发展苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国之间的相互谅解和合作，以利于和平和欧洲安全。”人们不能不看到：某些国家集团一直力图利用苏联和德意志联邦共和国没有正常关系的空子，来散布敌意和仇恨，企图制造并加深苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的不信任，以便从中取利。这种计划孕育着欧洲新战争的危险，严重地威胁着欧洲人民的安全和世界和平。由此不难看出，苏联同德意志联邦共和国外交关系的建立，和它们之间的谅解和合作，对于欧洲紧张局势的缓和，将带来何等的重大影响。这种影响毫无疑问地将在巩固欧洲和世界和平方面发生十分有利的作用。因此，人们有充分的根据认为，莫斯科谈判的结果，是国际和平力量的一个不平常的胜利。它对苏联人民和德意志人民有利，对全世界一切善良人民有利。
    为了阻挠谈判的成功，早在谈判开始之前，有人已经为莫斯科谈判划定了“范围”，并且断言这个谈判“不会有什么成果”。在谈判进行中，某些西方记者更不断散布悲观空气，一再扬言谈判“已陷入僵局”。现在，在谈判的结果已经公布之后，他们又想贬低它的意义，甚至暗示，苏联和西德外交关系的建立将遭受到拖延和阻挠。不用说，他们这种做法的目的，是要阻止苏联和德意志联邦共和国关系的正常化，从而破坏国际合作的进展。但是，事实证明他们的这种企图已经失败；事实还将证明他们的这种企图还要继续失败。苏联为谋求同德意志联邦共和国关系正常化的努力和它在谈判中的坚定立场，获得了全世界爱好和平人民的赞扬和支持。德国人民，特别是西德人民广泛要求同苏联建立正常关系。人民的意志是不可抗阻的；企图破坏日内瓦会议所形成的国际合作谅解的精神的计划被打乱了。这就再一次有力地证明：当前国际局势的主流毕竟是走向缓和。
    莫斯科谈判双方所持的坦率而开诚布公的态度给人以深刻的印象。双方都直言无讳地陈述了自己的见解和立场，这种坦白的陈述使双方更好地了解了彼此的态度，并在很大的程度上促进了谈判的成功。这表明：在谋求解决迫切国际问题的谈判中，有关方面只要真正从现实出发，并且能够本着互相谅解的精神，总是可以找到达成协议的道路的。采取“从实力地位出发”的政策的人只能遭到失败，这种政策已经是行不通了。
    中国人民，热烈欢迎苏联同德意志联邦共和国谈判的结果。中国人民同德意志人民一向有着友好的关系。两国人民曾经有过密切的经济往来和文化交流。这种往来已经在中国和德意志民主共和国的亲密友好关系中得到了很大的加强和发展。为了进一步开展中国人民和全体德意志人民之间的友好合作，为了争取和巩固世界持久和平，中国人民认为在中华人民共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间，建立正常关系的时机已经到来了。在国际关系中认真合作的精神已经导致了苏联和德意志联邦共和国的关系的改进，根据同样的精神中国和德意志联邦共和国的关系没有理由不可能正常化。
