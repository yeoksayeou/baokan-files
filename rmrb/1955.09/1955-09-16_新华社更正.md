In the fourteenth news release, "Soviet and West German Delegations Speak for the Second Time in the Talks on the Tenth" (published on page four of this newspaper on the fourteenth), the tenth and eleventh paragraphs, "Adenauer, you probably know the name of Feldmenger, right? He is a relative of Engels.
    This is the root of the whole problem." should read "Adenauer said: You probably know the name of Feldmenger, right? He is a relative of Engels.
    Khrushchev said: This is the root of the whole problem."
