Adhere to the Grain "Three Fixes" Policy Down to the Household

    Doing a Good Job in Grain Ordering
    Wu Shuo
    Ordering is an important part of the grain "Three Fixes" method. The "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" issued by the State Council on August 25th, made clear provisions for grain ordering. That is, from the fixed yield figures of farmers' grain fields, deduct the amount of grain used by farmers themselves and the public grain to be handed over, and calculate the amount of grain purchased by the state according to a reasonable single ratio (that is, not according to a progressive method); the unified purchase of grain generally accounts for 80% to 90% of the farmers' surplus grain, but the ratio of purchasing surplus grain from rich peasants should be appropriately increased; the grain sales tasks of surplus grain households that have been verified will remain unchanged for three years from 1955 onwards in normal years, and increased production will not increase purchases. When there is a crop failure due to natural disasters, the township people's committee will adjust the original grain sales task of the crop failure households according to the crop failure situation; if the adjustment result cannot guarantee the original purchase and sale difference within the province or autonomous region, or if a serious disaster occurs in one province, autonomous region or several provinces, affecting the state's purchase and sale plan and cannot be balanced, the state may appropriately increase purchases in bumper harvest areas, but the increase in purchases shall not exceed 40% of the increased production of farmers in bumper harvest areas due to the bumper harvest. It can be seen from the above principles that the provisions on ordering in the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" implement the principle of taking into account both the needs of the state and the possibilities of the farmers. Now the state is to negotiate with the farmers on the amount of grain to be purchased in a unified way within a certain period of time in accordance with these provisions, that is, to establish an agreement with the farmers. Therefore, doing a good job in ordering down to the household will surely make our worker-peasant alliance more consolidated and enable the state's socialist construction to advance victoriously.
    After the ordering is done down to the household, every farmer with surplus grain can know how much grain he should sell to the state in the three years from 1955 to 1957, and how much surplus grain he can freely dispose of after completing the sales task. In this way, he will work hard to complete the grain sales task verified by the state, and will also better arrange production and life. Moreover, because the ordered figures remain unchanged for three years under normal circumstances, and grain can be increased year by year, farmers will clearly know that the more production is increased in the future, the more grain will be retained. Surplus grain households have the full right to freely dispose of the remaining grain after completing the grain sales task. They can freely store it, use it themselves, continue to sell it to the state, trade it in the national grain market, and exchange it among farmers, as long as they do not engage in grain speculation, the state will not interfere. Therefore, after the ordering figures are determined down to the household, the vast number of farmers will further increase their enthusiasm for increasing production.
    We should sufficiently estimate the complexity of the work of determining the ordering figures down to the household. Since there are currently only 650,000 agricultural production cooperatives in our country, and individual farmers still account for the majority, it is not an easy task to clearly distinguish the boundaries between surplus grain households, grain-deficient households, and self-sufficient households among approximately 100 million individual farmers, and to reasonably stipulate the grain sales tasks for surplus grain households; however, as long as all localities correctly implement the measures promulgated by the State Council, and as long as the vast number of farmers strongly support and assist this work, then it is entirely possible to do a good job in ordering down to the household.
    The prerequisite for doing a good job in ordering down to the household is of course to do a good job in fixing production; however, if the fixed production figures are reasonably stipulated, if the amount of grain used by farmers themselves is not reasonably stipulated, it will not be possible to truly distinguish the boundaries between surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, and grain-deficient households, and as a result, it will still not be possible to determine reasonable unified purchase figures. As everyone knows, if the unified purchase figures are set too high, it will cause some farmers to sell "excessive grain," causing difficulties in farmers' lives and production; if they are set too low, it will hinder the completion of the state's unified purchase plan and affect the national grain supply. It can be seen that setting the grain unified purchase figures too high or too low is unfavorable to both the state and the farmers. Then, what is the correct policy that must be implemented when determining the unified purchase figures? The correct policy is what Vice Premier Chen Yun of the State Council mentioned in his speech "On the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain" at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress: "Stipulate grain retention standards according to the existing consumption level in various regions, and enough grain must be retained; do not purchase all the surplus grain of farmers, so that farmers can still save a certain amount of surplus grain after the state's unified purchase. Strive to eliminate the phenomenon of purchasing 'excessive grain'."
    To implement this policy of ordering down to the household, the most important thing is to correctly calculate the amount of grain used by farmers after fixing production. When deliberating on various grain use standards, farmers should participate in the evaluation work with an honest attitude, and do not falsely report the number of people and livestock, so that the various grain use figures can be determined practically and reasonably. The amount of grain used by farmers should generally include three items: seeds necessary for reproduction or expanded reproduction, rations consumed in a year, and feed for feeding livestock. The amount of seeds retained must be stipulated according to actual needs. For example, how many kilograms of wheat seeds are actually needed to plant one mu of wheat field should be stipulated, no more and no less. As for human rations and livestock feed, one should not aim for high grain consumption levels, nor should one use the low grain consumption quantity of individual households as the standard; but must be determined based on the general consumption level of local farmers and the general needs of local livestock breeding. If the various grain use standards are set high and set more, it will affect the completion of the state's unified purchase task; if they are set low and set less, it will affect the production and life of farmers. As for some areas with very good forage conditions that have never used grain to feed livestock, feed should not be included in the amount of grain used. Some places do not adopt the method of classifying and stipulating seeds, rations, and feed when determining grain use standards, but adopt the method of stipulating a unified exemption amount per person. For example, the average amount of seeds, rations, and feed needed by each person is the exemption amount, which is the amount of grain used by each farmer. Of course, when adopting this method, it is still necessary to fully take into account the general consumption level and actual needs of local farmers. In areas that produce tubers, farmers are accustomed to treating tubers as part of their rations and feed. In such areas, a certain proportion of tubers should be included in the amount of rations and feed, so Article 13 of the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" stipulates: "In areas that produce tubers, the appropriate proportion of tubers in the amount of rations and feed should be stipulated according to local consumption habits." However, in order to plan to expand tuber production and take care of the interests of surplus grain households that grow tubers, and avoid the phenomenon of "surplus grain households eating sweet potatoes and grain-deficient households eating grain," the state also purchases a portion of tubers according to supply needs and storage conditions.
    If the yield of farmers' grain fields is correctly verified, and the grain use standards are also reasonably determined, then the boundaries between surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, and grain-deficient households in rural areas will be easily distinguished. On this basis, distributing grain sales tasks to surplus grain households can also be done fairly and reasonably. The grain sales figures of surplus grain households that have been deeply discussed and evaluated by the masses of farmers, after being approved by the township people's congress, are compiled into a register and reported to the county-level people's committee or its designated organ for verification, which becomes the figure for the amount of grain that surplus grain households should sell to the state. Farmers with surplus grain should promote the spirit of patriotism, guarantee the completion of this glorious task, and support the state's socialist industrialization cause.

专栏：把粮食“三定”政策贯彻到户

    做好粮食定购工作
    吴硕
    定购是粮食“三定”办法的重要内容之一。国务院八月二十五日发布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”中，对粮食定购作了明确的规定。这就是，从农民的粮田定产数字中扣除农民自己的用粮数量和应交公粮，余粮按合理的单一的比例（就是不按累进的办法）计算国家统购粮食的数字；统购的粮食一般占农民的余粮的百分之八十至九十，只是对富农购余粮比率要适当提高；经过核定的余粮户粮食交售任务，在正常年景下，自一九五五年起，三年不变，增产不增购。因自然灾害而歉收时，由乡人民委员会根据歉收户的歉收情况，调整其原定的粮食交售任务；调整的结果，在省、自治区范围内不能保证原定的收销差额时或者在一省、自治区或数省发生严重灾害，影响国家收销计划不能平衡时，国家可在丰收地区酌量增购，但增购数字也不超过丰收地区农户因丰收而增产部分的百分之四十。从上面的原则可以看出，“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”中关于定购的规定，是贯彻了既照顾国家的需要、又照顾农民的可能的原则的。现在国家就是要按照这些规定，同农民商定一定时期内统购粮食的数量，也就是说，同农民成立协定。所以，做好定购到户工作，一定会使我们的工农联盟更加巩固，并使得国家的社会主义建设胜利前进。
    定购到户后，每一个有余粮的农民都可以知道在一九五五年到一九五七年的三年内，他应当向国家交售多少粮食，完成交售任务后自己还可以有多少余粮自由支配，这样，他就会努力完成国家核定的粮食交售任务，也会更好地安排生产和生活。又因为定购的数字在正常情况下是三年不变的，而粮食又是可以年年增产的，因此，农民便会清楚地知道，今后增加生产越多，留粮也就越多。余粮户在完成粮食交售任务后剩余的粮食，完全有权自由处理，可以自由存贮，可以自己使用，可以继续售给国家，可以在国家粮食市场进行交易，可以在农户间互通有无，只要不进行粮食投机，国家都不加干涉。因此，定购数字确定到户以后，广大农民一定会进一步提高增产积极性。
    我们应该足够地估计到定购数字确定到户这一工作的复杂性。由于目前我国还只有六十五万个农业生产合作社，个体农户仍占大多数，要在大约一万万个个体农户中划清余粮户、缺粮户、自足户的界限，合理地规定出余粮户粮食交售任务，这不是一件容易的事；但是只要各地正确地贯彻国务院公布的办法，只要广大农民大力支持和协助这一工作，那末，做好定购到户的工作，是完全可能的。
    做好定购到户工作的前提当然是做好定产工作；但是，光是定产数字规定得合理了，如果农民自用粮食数量规定得不合理，就不可能真正划清余粮户、自足户、缺粮户的界限，结果就仍然不可能定出合理的统购数字。大家知道，统购数字定得高了，就会使某些农民卖了“过头粮”，造成农民生活和生产的困难；定得低了，就会妨碍国家统购计划的完成，影响全国粮食的供应。可见，粮食统购数字定得过高过低，对国家和农民都是不利的。那末，什么是确定统购数字时必须贯彻的正确方针呢？正确的方针就是国务院陈云副总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上“关于粮食的统购统销问题”的发言中所提到的：“按照各地现有的消费水平规定留粮标准，留粮必须留够；不购买农民的全部余粮，使农民在国家统购以后，还能保存一定数量的余粮。力求消灭购‘过头粮’的现象。”
    贯彻这个定购到户的方针，最要紧的是在定产以后正确地计算农户的用粮量。在酝酿各项用粮标准时，农民们应该用老老实实的态度来参加评议工作，不要虚报人口和牲畜数字，这样才能把各项用粮数字定得切实、合理。农户的用粮量一般应包括再生产或扩大再生产所必需的种子、一年所消费的口粮和喂养牲畜的饲料三项用粮。种子的留量，必须依据实际需要来规定，比方说，种一亩麦田实际需要多少斤麦种，就应当规定多少斤，不能多也不能少。至于人的口粮和牲畜的饲料，就不应向用粮水平高的看齐，也不应以个别户的用粮数量低的为标准；而必须根据当地农民一般的消费水平和当地饲养牲畜的一般需要来确定。各项用粮标准定得高了定得多了，就会影响国家统购任务的完成；定得低了定得少了，就会影响农民的生产和生活。至于有些饲草条件很好、向来不用粮食喂养牲畜的地区，就不应在用粮量内计算饲料。有的地方在确定用粮标准时不是采取按种子、口粮、饲料分类规定的办法，而是采取按人规定统一的免购额的办法。比如规定每一个人平均所需要的种子、口粮和饲料的数量，就是免购额，也就是每一个农民的用粮量。当然，采用这种办法，仍然必须充分照顾到当地农民的一般消费水平和实际需要。在生产薯类的地区，农民习惯上是把薯类当作一部分口粮和饲料的。在这类地区，应在口粮和饲料用粮量内规定包括一定比例的薯类，所以“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”第十三条规定：“在生产薯类的地区，应根据当地消费习惯，规定薯类占口粮和饲料用粮量的适当比例。”不过，国家为了有计划地扩大薯类生产和照顾种有薯类的余粮户的利益，避免“余粮户吃甘薯，缺粮户吃粮食”的现象，根据供应需要和保管条件，也酌量收购一部分薯类。
    农户粮田的产量正确地核定了，用粮标准也合理地确定了，这个时候，农村中的余粮户、自足户、缺粮户的界限也就容易划分清楚了。在这个基础上向余粮户分配粮食交售任务，也就可以做到公平合理了。经过农民群众深入的讨论评定出来的余粮户粮食交售数字，经过乡人民代表大会通过后，造具清册，报县级人民委员会或其指定机关核定，这就成为余粮户应该向国家交售粮食的数字。有余粮的农民们应当发扬爱国主义精神，保证完成这个光荣任务，支援国家社会主义工业化事业。
