Comrades,

I warmly celebrate the opening of the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Youth. This congress is a great gathering of Chinese youth in the era of Mao Zedong—the era of socialist construction. This congress marks the imminent arrival of a high tide of comprehensive socialist construction. You come from all fronts fighting for socialist construction. You have already made great contributions to socialist construction, and you will make even greater contributions in the future. The youth of socialism depends first of all on the youth of the entire country contributing their youthful light and heat. With you as a commando team in the socialist construction cause of the people of the whole country, socialist construction will inevitably be victorious. I wish you "good health, good study, and good work," and advance towards great socialism.

I am now going to introduce to the congress the achievements of the first three years of the state's first Five-Year Plan and the tasks for the next two years. First, I will talk about the Party's general line and general task during the transition period.

I. The General Task of the State in the Transition Period

The Chinese Communist Party, leading the Chinese people through twenty-eight years of arduous struggle and bloody sacrifice, finally overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and completed the historical task of the New Democratic Revolution. The New Democratic Revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution. The task of the Party is to lead the Chinese people through the New Democratic Revolution and further carry out the socialist revolution. The revolution we are now carrying out is precisely the socialist revolution.

What is the historical task that the socialist revolution wants to accomplish? It is to establish a great modern industrialized and agriculturally cooperative and mechanized socialist society in China, completely eliminate capitalist elements in urban and rural areas, completely eliminate the exploiting classes, and replace private ownership with public ownership of the means of production, so that China becomes a prosperous and strong socialist new China. At that time, the Chinese people will live an equal and happy life where each does his best, receives according to his work, and there is no exploitation and no poverty.

In order to realize this great historical task of the socialist revolution, the Chinese Communist Party proposed the general line of the Party in the transition period in 1952, which was later accepted by the First Session of the First National People's Congress and incorporated into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China as the general task of the state in the transition period. The preamble to the Constitution stipulates: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the completion of socialist society is a transition period. The general task of the state in the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce."

What is socialist industrialization?

Socialist industrialization is: (1) developing state-owned modern industry under socialist ownership and transforming private capitalist industry into socialist industry; (2) developing heavy industry to improve our independent ability to manufacture technical equipment, establish a socialist material base, so as to consolidate national defense, increase the production of daily-use industrial products, and realize agricultural mechanization to improve people's lives; (3) the output value of modern industry accounts for a considerable advantage in the total output value of industry and agriculture.

What are the benefits of socialist industrialization? (1) It can equip the entire national economy, including agriculture, with new technologies; (2) It provides a material basis for the socialist economy to defeat and eliminate the capitalist economy; (3) It enables the country to have technical and economic independence in the face of capitalist encirclement, thereby consolidating national defense; (4) It can continuously expand production, gradually meet the growing needs of the people, and continuously improve people's lives.

What is socialist transformation?

Socialist transformation is to gradually change the private ownership of the means of production into public ownership through appropriate transitional forms. In industry and commerce, it is to transform the private ownership of capitalists into ownership by the whole people through various forms of state capitalism; in agriculture and handicrafts, it is to transform the individual ownership of small producers into the collective ownership of the working people through the road of cooperation. Liberate the productive forces so that they can continue to develop.

Chairman Mao instructed us in his recent report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" that the socialist transformation of agriculture, which relates to more than 500 million rural people, is a revolutionary movement with extremely great world significance.

The socialist transformation of agriculture is the fundamental way for peasants to finally get rid of exploitation and poverty; it is the inevitable way to develop agricultural production and implement agricultural technological reforms. The current agricultural production cooperatives are still semi-socialist, and in the future, they will gradually reach fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives (i.e., collective farms) on a voluntary basis.

The tasks of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation are closely integrated. Socialist industrialization, the transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are inseparable. Chairman Mao's report instructed us: "We are now not only carrying out a revolution in the social system from private ownership to public ownership, but also a revolution in technology from handicraft production to large-scale modern machine production, and these two revolutions are combined. ... We must not divide and isolate the two things of industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and socialist agricultural transformation. We must not only emphasize one aspect and weaken the other." If we divide and isolate these two major events, for example, only emphasize industry and industrialization, and ignore agricultural cooperation, ignore the socialist transformation and technological transformation of agriculture, what will happen then? Then, the strength of the worker-peasant alliance will be weakened, the socialist position in the countryside cannot be consolidated and expanded, and capitalism will be in danger of rising. Economically, agricultural and industrial production will be disconnected, the entire national economy will experience inconsistencies, the supply of increasingly needed commodity grains and industrial raw materials will encounter serious difficulties, industrial products will not have a broad sales market, the development of industry and agriculture will suffer difficulties, the people's living standards cannot be improved, the country's capital accumulation will be seriously affected, and the worker-peasant alliance will also be damaged. In a word, if this is the case, we will deviate from the Party's general line, and the entire socialist construction cause will be in danger of failure. Comrades, the extreme importance of Chairman Mao's instruction lies here, and we should resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to implement it.

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy, formulated in accordance with the Party's general line in the transition period, is a major step and the first great economic program for striving to realize the state's general task in the transition period. The basic task of the first Five-Year Plan, as everyone knows, is to establish a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization in our country within five years; to establish a preliminary foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; and to establish a foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. With such a foundation, we can ensure that we will complete the construction of socialist society after three five-year plans.

II. Basic Situation of the Implementation of the Five-Year Plan in the First Three Years

The first Five-Year Plan has been implemented for nearly three years. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the state, the conscious and hard work of the people of the whole country, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, we have made great achievements in all aspects of the national economy in the past three years (according to the actual implementation results in 1953 and 1954 and the estimate for 1955), and have achieved great victories in the two mutually integrated aspects of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. The achievements of the past three years have formed a high tide of our entire national economy.

The details are as follows:

(1) Capital Construction: The scale of the five-year capital construction centered on the development of heavy industry is huge. Within five years, 694 industrial construction units above the quota will be carried out, of which 485 will be put into production before the end of 1957, and they will be able to produce many new products that our country has never produced in history. Of these 485 industrial construction units, it is estimated that 271 will be put into production before 1955. After these units are put into production, the production capacity of our industry will be greatly increased. Taking only the newly built enterprises under the jurisdiction of the central ministries as an example: in the past three years, the annual production capacity of coal has increased by more than 26 million tons, the power generation capacity has increased by more than 900,000 kilowatts, the annual production capacity of oil has increased by 980,000 tons, the annual production capacity of pig iron has increased by 1.42 million tons, the annual production capacity of steel has increased by 740,000 tons, and the annual production capacity of generators has increased by 200,000 kilowatts. The annual production capacity of transformers has increased by 2 million kVA, the annual production capacity of paper machines has increased by 33,000 tons, the number of spindles has increased by 750,000, and the number of looms has increased by 22,000. The production capacity of other major products of non-ferrous metal industry, chemical industry, and light industry has also increased significantly.

The five-year plan calls for laying 4,084 kilometers of new railway tracks, and about 2,500 kilometers have been completed in the first three years. In addition, the number of railway locomotives has increased by 284, passenger cars by 1,390, and freight cars by 18,800 in the first three years. The five-year plan stipulates that the mileage of highway construction opened to traffic by the central investment will be more than 7,000 kilometers, and the mileage opened to traffic in the first three years has reached 6,900 kilometers. The five-year plan stipulates that the tonnage of inland and ocean-going ships should be increased by 400,000 tons deadweight, and 190,000 tons deadweight have been increased in the first three years. The rapid growth of various transportation capacities in the past three years has adapted to the needs of national economic construction.

In the past three years, we have reclaimed 23 million mu of wasteland. Along with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the number of state-owned tractor stations has increased from 11 in 1953 to 112 in 1955, and the number of tractors has increased from 113 to 1,896 (standard units). The number of state-owned mechanized farms was 50 in 1952, with 2.03 million mu of cultivated land and 1,531 tractors (standard units); it is estimated that they will develop to 106 in 1955, with 4.15 million mu of cultivated land and 3,012 tractors (standard units).

In terms of water conservancy construction, the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River and the four reservoirs of Nanwan, Boshan, and Foziling on the Huai River have been completed in the past three years, with a total storage capacity of more than 3.9 billion cubic meters.

It can be seen that the capital construction in the past three years has achieved great achievements.

(2) Industrial Production: The total industrial output value of the country is expected to increase by about 62% in 1955 compared with 1952, with an average annual increase of 17.5%. As everyone knows, the five-year plan stipulates that the industrial output value should increase by 98.3% in five years, that is, an average annual increase of 14.7%. It can be seen that the total output value plan for the five-year industrial production can be overfulfilled.

The output of major industrial products has also increased rapidly. For example, compared with 1952, iron is expected to increase by about 94% in 1955, steel by more than 99%, steel materials by 113%, power generation by about 73%, raw coal by 46%, crude oil by more than 120%, and double-wheel double-blade plows by 104 times, etc.

The increased output value in the past three years has mainly come from tapping the potential of existing enterprises. This situation will not change significantly until the second five-year plan, but even at that time, the production potential of existing enterprises will still be great. Therefore, while we concentrate our main efforts on capital construction, we must not neglect to strengthen the management and production leadership of existing enterprises.

The experience of the past three years shows that although the development of industry is fast, there are still two problems that affect the further growth of industrial speed. In the heavy industry, the main problem is that the technology is not high, and many needed new products cannot be manufactured; in the light industry, the main problem is the lack of raw materials. Therefore, improving the technical level, improving product quality, increasing new varieties, saving raw materials, and expanding raw material resources are of great significance to industrial production increase.

Of the output value increased by state-owned industry in the past three years, about 66% was obtained by increasing labor productivity, and about 34% was obtained by increasing workers. The improvement of labor productivity is, in the final analysis, an important factor to ensure the victory of socialism. Therefore, we must unswervingly implement the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, so that we can continuously use new equipment to transform the entire industry and the entire national economy; we must be proficient in technology so that equipment can be fully utilized. We must improve the socialist consciousness of every employee, work hard to learn technology, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of production.

(3) Agricultural Production: The total agricultural output value of the country is expected to increase by about 10% in 1955 compared with 1952, of which grain output will increase by about 9% and the output value of technical crops will increase by about 10%.

In the past three years, the growth rate of agricultural production has not been high, which also fully shows that before the entire agricultural production is transformed from the private, backward, and decentralized small-scale peasant economy to a cooperative and mechanized large-scale agricultural economy, the growth rate is still impossible to be very fast due to the limitations of small-scale production conditions. However, agriculture is one of the two main sectors of the national economy, and if agriculture cannot keep up, it will have a huge impact on the entire national economy. Therefore, overcoming difficulties and completing the task of increasing agricultural production is of extremely great significance. When we plan the development of the cooperation movement, we must also plan the increase of agricultural production, because cooperation should ensure the increase of agricultural production, and the increase of agricultural production can consolidate and promote the cooperation movement.

The agricultural production increase task stipulated in the five-year plan is arduous, but there are also favorable conditions for completing the task and striving to exceed it. These conditions are: the improvement of peasants' socialist enthusiasm and the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement; the advance of socialist industrialization and the strengthening of industrial support for agriculture; the strengthening of the Party and the government's leadership over agricultural production. These conditions are fundamental, constantly effective, and are in the process of development. With these favorable conditions, various agricultural production increase measures can be reasonably implemented, and the huge potential existing in agriculture will be well utilized.

(4) In terms of Transportation and Commodity Circulation: The total freight volume of our country (including the freight volume of railways, shipping, automobiles, and aviation) is expected to increase by about 70% in 1955 compared with 1952. The total passenger volume increased by 51%. The total retail sales of social commodities increased by about 50.3%. It can be seen that the growth of transportation and commodity circulation in the past three years is also not slow.

(5) In terms of Labor Productivity, Wages, and Labor Insurance and Welfare: It is estimated that in 1955, labor productivity in state-owned industry will increase by 51.5%; the national average wage will increase by 20.5%; and labor insurance and welfare expenses (including wage supplements and enterprise reward funds) will increase by about 113%.

(6) In terms of Culture and Education: It is estimated that in 1955, compared with 1952, the number of students in colleges and universities will increase by 51% (that is, an increase of 98,300 people), the number of students in senior high schools will increase by 124% (that is, an increase of 322,000 people), the number of students in junior high schools will increase by 52% (that is, an increase of 1,163,000 people), and the number of primary school students will increase by 7.7% (that is, an increase of 3,920,000 people). Various cultural publishing undertakings have also made great progress. Compared with the period of reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, what we have done in the past three years in terms of culture and education has generally exceeded the twenty years of rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. This miracle can only happen when the people have seized power and are moving towards socialism.

From the development of industry in our country in the past three years, we can draw the conclusion that our country has actively taken a step forward towards socialist industrialization.

(1) The proportion of modern industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture has increased from 26.7% in 1952 to an estimated 33% or more in 1955.

(2) The proportion of state-owned industry in the total industrial output value has increased from 52.8% in 1952 to an estimated 61% or more in 1955; the proportion of cooperative industry has increased from 3.2% to 4.4% in 1955; the proportion of joint state-private industry has increased from 5% to an estimated 15%; and the proportion of private industry has decreased from 39% to an estimated 18% or so.

(3) The output value of means of production in the total industrial output value has increased from 39.7% in 1952 to an estimated 45% in 1955.

(4) Our country's industry is moving towards the direction of independent manufacturing. The proportion of the output value of the machinery industry in the total industrial output value has increased from 5.2% in 1952 to 6.3% in 1954. Our country has been able to produce many new products that could never be produced in the past.

The construction in the past three years has also made our national economy take a step forward on the road of socialist transformation.

(1) The rural cooperation movement has developed rapidly under the Party's active and planned leadership. There were only more than 3,600 agricultural production cooperatives in the country in 1952, with only more than 59,000 households participating, but by June 1955, it had developed to 650,000 cooperatives (after rectification), with 16.9 million households participating.

Agricultural production cooperatives have fully demonstrated their superiority. Among the existing 650,000 cooperatives, 80% of the cooperatives have increased production, more than 10% of the cooperatives have not increased or decreased, and a few percent of the cooperatives have reduced production. But it can be affirmed that these more than 10% of the cooperatives that did not increase or decrease or reduced production in the first year may improve after rectification, and many of them can increase production.

The working peasants, first of all the poor peasants, the lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants, who account for 60% to 70% of the rural population, and the lower-middle peasants among the old middle peasants, especially the activists among these groups, have gradually realized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives through what they have seen with their own eyes. Chairman Mao recently instructed: "A high tide of the new socialist mass movement is about to come in the rural areas of the whole country." He also said: "We should actively, enthusiastically, and planfully lead this movement." The young activists in the countryside should become the vanguard force in this movement.

(2) Handicraft production cooperatives have also developed to a certain extent. There are nearly 9 million handicraft workers in urban and rural areas across the country. In 1952, 220,000 people participated in handicraft production cooperatives, with an output value of more than 240 million yuan; the estimate for 1955 is that the number of people will increase to 900,000, and the output value will increase to 1.36 billion yuan. In addition, handicraft production groups with certain socialist sprouts have also developed in the past three years.

(3) Various forms of state capitalism have greatly developed. In industry, it is estimated that by 1955, in the past three years, private industrial enterprises equivalent to 36% of the output value of private large-scale industries in 1952 have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. In the first half of 1955, the value of products processed, ordered, exclusively purchased, packaged, and purchased by the state accounted for about 93% of the output value of private large-scale industries. In commerce, the proportion of private commerce in the total social retail sales has decreased from 65.9% in 1952 to an estimated 45.9% in 1955. And among this 45.9%, 13.4% belongs to distribution, agency sales, and joint ventures. The wholesale position has basically been controlled by socialist commerce.

(4) As a result of the forward development of the socialist economy, the proportion of national fiscal revenue from state-owned economy and supply and marketing cooperatives (tax revenue) has increased from 59% in 1952 to an estimated 74% in 1955. This has made the country's fiscal revenue have a more solid foundation.

What general conclusions should we draw from the implementation of the plan in the past three years? These conclusions are:

The speed of industrial development in the past three years has been very fast.

The progress of socialist transformation, especially the socialist transformation of agriculture, has been very fast in the past three years.

The change in the economic face of our country in the past three years has been rapid.

The experience of the past three years proves that the first Five-Year Plan will definitely be completed, and socialist society will definitely be built after three five-year plans.

Socialism is infinitely beautiful, but there are difficulties on the road to socialist construction. The process of completing socialist construction is also a process of hard struggle to constantly overcome difficulties.

Socialism has infinite superiority, but socialism will never come peacefully without encountering any resistance. On the contrary, it can only be realized through complex class struggles. The five-year plan is a special form of class struggle.

The leadership of the Party is the guarantee of socialist victory. The continuous improvement of the consciousness of the masses, especially the workers and peasants, is the reliance on the strength to realize socialism. In front of the conscious masses under the leadership of the Party, any difficulty must bow its head, and any enemy can only fail.

III. Tasks for the Next Two Years

From the implementation of the five-year plan in the first three years, it can be seen that we have achieved great achievements in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. But on the other hand, we must also see that the tasks left to the last two years of the five-year plan are still very heavy, especially in agriculture and capital construction, the tasks of the last two years will be even more tense. Therefore, to successfully complete the first five-year plan, we must make greater efforts than in the past three years. The current task of the people of the whole country is to strive to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan with unremitting efforts and selfless labor, and to meet the new high tide of socialist construction.

According to the requirements of the first five-year plan, what specific tasks will there be in the next two years?

(1) Capital Construction: 52% of the total workload stipulated in the five-year plan has been completed in the first three years, and 48% must continue to be completed in the next two years. In 1956 alone, there will be 555 factory and mine construction units above the quota that will start construction and continue construction, of which 162 units are scheduled to be completed in 1956, which is 47 more units than the cumulative number of units completed in the past three years. The largest and most technically complex construction projects in the five-year plan will be fully launched from 1956. Among the 156 construction units designed by the Soviet Union to help our country, 118 will be under construction at the same time next year.

(2) Industrial Production: In the next two years, the total industrial output value of the country will increase by 22% compared with 1955, and the output of major industrial products will increase significantly.

(3) Agricultural Production: In the next two years, the growth ratio of major crop yields will be: grain will increase by about 8%, cotton will increase by about 25%, and other crops such as jute, flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, and peanuts will increase significantly.

(4) Transportation Industry: The freight volume of various transportation departments is required to increase by 28% compared with 1955, and the passenger volume will increase by about 16%. If the mileage of new railway tracks includes additional projects, it will increase by 3,300 kilometers in the next two years, and the number of ships will increase by 210,000 tons.

(5) Commerce: The total retail sales of social commodities will increase by about 20% compared with 1955.

(6) Culture and Education: The number of students in colleges and universities is required to increase by 50% compared with 1955, the number of students in secondary vocational schools and high schools is required to increase by 24% each, and the number of students in junior high schools is required to increase by 17.4%.

From the above main indicators, it can be seen that the specific tasks of the last two years of the five-year plan are still very heavy. Among these indicators, the growth ratio of some indicators is very high, and we must make the greatest efforts to ensure completion; although the growth ratio of some indicators is low, it should also be prepared to increase at any time in the annual plan according to needs and possibilities, in order to strive for the overfulfillment of the five-year plan.

Now, let us look forward to the economic situation in 1956 and the favorable conditions for completing the five-year plan.

According to the estimates of all parties, this year's agricultural production will be a bumper year. As long as no unexpected disasters occur during the autumn harvest season, this year's cotton and grain production can complete the plan. The peasants of the whole country should make persistent efforts to complete and overfulfill the state plan.

On the basis of a bumper harvest in agriculture, the economic situation in the fourth quarter of this year and next year will be more active. Because of the bumper harvest in agriculture, we can set the industrial production targets for next year more actively. The increase in industrial production, in turn, can supply peasants with more means of living and means of production, promote agricultural development, and promote urban-rural exchanges and further activation of the market. On the basis of the accelerated development of industry and agriculture and a more active market, the country's accumulation will also increase, so that we can invest more funds in construction. All these will inevitably promote the further upsurge of industrial and agricultural production and the national economy in the next two years; people's lives will also be further improved, and the average wages of workers and the monetary income of peasants will increase.

1956 is the most decisive year for completing the first five-year plan. We should set the annual plan for 1956 more actively than 1955 and ensure its completion.

What favorable conditions do we have to ensure the completion of the 1956 plan and the first five-year plan?

(1) The proposal of the general line, the formulation of the Constitution, and the publication of the first five-year plan, the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country for socialist construction and socialist transformation. Relying on this enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, we can overcome any difficulties that may be encountered in the process of realizing the five-year plan and ensure the victorious completion of the five-year plan.

(2) Socialist industry will be further developed, private capitalist industry will be further transformed, and the socialist economic foundation will be increasingly strengthened. Therefore, it can more powerfully promote the upsurge of the entire national economy.

(3) The high tide of the cooperation movement in the countryside, the proper arrangements for the steps and various policies of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the strengthening of the Party's leadership over agricultural production and rural work, the strengthening of the socialist foundation in the countryside, the increase in the state's investment in agriculture, the increase in industrial support for agriculture, and the improvement of the production enthusiasm of the peasants across the country, enable us to have the conditions to strive for continuous agricultural harvests for three years.

(4) Because of the great achievements of the conservation movement, we can use the funds saved to bring forward the construction projects that were postponed due to limited investment when formulating the five-year plan, so that all aspects of the national economy can be more adapted and can be more coordinated and rapidly developed.

(5) In all aspects of the national economy, in all links of industrial and agricultural production and capital construction, we still have great potential strength. As long as the people of the whole country, especially the youth, are good at giving play to their enthusiasm and creativity, promoting advanced experience, working hard to learn technology, and overcoming backward links, we can ensure the completion of the task of increasing industrial and agricultural production.

(6) The experience of implementing the three annual plans has given us more understanding of the objective economic situation and the laws of development, and the work in all aspects has also been improved. This makes our subjective aspects have more sufficient conditions to strive for the completion of the five-year plan and lay a good foundation for the second five-year plan.

Chairman Mao taught us in his opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "The people of our country should work hard, work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, be honest and diligent, encourage and help each other, avoid any exaggeration and pride, and prepare to build our current economically and culturally backward country into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture within a few five-year plans.

Our cause is just. A just cause cannot be broken by any enemy.

The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party.

The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism.

We have full confidence to overcome all difficulties and hardships and build our country into a great socialist republic."

We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and continue to move forward! We must strengthen political study, improve vigilance, and smash the enemy's sabotage conspiracy; we must strengthen technical and cultural study and improve our working ability; we must carry forward enthusiasm and creativity, organize labor competitions, and strive to increase production and practice economy; we must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, unite all young people and the people of the whole country, and strive to complete the first five-year plan.

    五年计划前三年的成就和今后两年的任务
    ——九月二十一日在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上的报告（摘要）
    国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任　李富春
    我热烈地庆祝全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的召开。这个大会，是毛泽东时代——社会主义建设时代的中国青年的大会师。这个大会标志着全面的社会主义建设的高潮即将到来。你们来自为社会主义建设而奋斗的各个战线。你们为社会主义建设已经有了很大贡献，而且将来还要有更大的贡献。社会主义的青春，首先就靠全国青年贡献出自己的青春的光和热，在全国人民的社会主义建设事业中有了你们作为突击队，社会主义建设必然胜利，祝你们“身体好，学习好，工作好”，向伟大的社会主义前进。
    我现在要向大会介绍国家第一个五年计划的前三年的成就和今后两年的任务。首先讲讲党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。
    一、国家在过渡时期的总任务
    中国共产党领导中国人民经过二十八年的艰苦奋斗和流血牺牲，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，完成了新民主主义革命的历史任务。新民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备。党的任务，就是要经过新民主主义革命，再进一步领导中国人民进行社会主义的革命。现在我们所进行的革命正是社会主义革命。
    社会主义革命所要完成的历史任务是什么呢？是要在中国建立起一个伟大的现代工业化的和农业合作化、机械化的社会主义社会，完全消灭城乡资本主义成份，完全消灭剥削阶级，以生产资料公有制来代替私有制，使中国成为富强的社会主义新中国。那时，中国人民就将过着各尽所能、按劳取酬、没有剥削、没有贫困的平等幸福的生活。
    为着实现这一伟大的社会主义革命的历史任务，中国共产党于一九五二年提出了党在过渡时期的总路线，后又经第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议所接受，作为国家在过渡时期的总任务载入中华人民共和国宪法。宪法序言规定：“从中华人民共和国成立到社会主义社会建成，这是一个过渡时期。国家在过渡时期的总任务是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”
    什么是社会主义工业化呢？
    社会主义工业化就是：（一）发展社会主义所有制的国营的现代工业，并改造私人资本主义的工业为社会主义的工业；（二）发展重工业，以提高自己制造技术设备的独立能力，建立社会主义的物质基础，以便在这个基础之上，巩固国防，增加日用工业品的生产和实现农业机械化，以改善人民的生活；（三）现代工业的产值在工农业总产值中占相当大的优势。
    社会主义工业化有什么好处呢？（一）可使包括农业在内的整个国民经济用新的技术装备起来；
  （二）使社会主义经济战胜和消灭资本主义经济具备了物质基础；（三）使国家在资本主义包围的情况下具有了技术上和经济上的独立，从而可以巩固国防；（四）能不断地扩大生产，逐步满足人民日益增长的需要，不断地改善人民生活。
    什么是社会主义改造呢？
    社会主义改造就是经过适当的过渡形式，逐步地变生产资料的私有制为公有制。在工商业方面，就是通过国家资本主义的各种形式，变资本家的私人所有制为全民所有制；在农业和手工业方面，就是通过合作化的道路，变小生产者的个体所有制为劳动人民的集体所有制。解放生产力，使之能不断发展。
    毛主席在最近所作“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中指示我们，关系到五亿多农村人口的农业社会主义改造，是带有极其伟大的世界意义的革命运动。
    农业社会主义改造，是农民最后摆脱剥削和贫困的根本道路；是发展农业生产和实行农业技术改革必经之路。现在的农业生产合作社还是半社会主义的，将来还要在自愿的基础上逐步达到完全的社会主义的农业生产合作社（即集体农场）。
    社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的任务是密切结合在一起的，社会主义工业化，对农业、手工业的改造和对资本主义工商业的改造，这三者是不可分割的。毛主席报告指示我们说：“我们现在不但正在进行关于社会制度方面的由私有制到公有制的革命，而且正在进行技术方面的由手工业生产到大规模现代化机器生产的革命，而这两种革命是结合在一起的。……我们对于工业和农业，社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。”如果我们对这样两件大事分割起来和孤立起来去看，譬如说只强调工业、工业化，而忽视了农业的合作化，忽视农业的社会主义改造和技术改造，那时情况会怎样呢？那么，工农团结的力量就会减弱，社会主义在农村的阵地就不能巩固和扩大，资本主义就有抬头的危险。在经济上，农业和工业生产就会脱节，整个国民经济会发生不相适应的现象，需要日益增长的商品粮食和工业的原料的供应会发生严重的困难，工业品就不能有广大的销售市场，工农业的发展都要遭受困难，人民的生活水平就不可能提高，国家的资金积累会受到严重的影响，工农联盟也就要受到损害，一句话，如果这样，我们就脱离了党的总路线，整个社会主义建设事业就会有失败的危险。同志们，毛主席这个指示的极端重要性就在这里，我们应当坚决遵照毛主席的指示来执行。
    根据党在过渡时期的总路线所制定的发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划，是为实现国家在过渡时期总任务而奋斗的一个重大步骤和第一个伟大的经济纲领。第一个五年计划的基本任务，正像大家所知道的，就是要于五年内，在我国建立起社会主义工业化的初步基础；建立对农业和手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础；建立对私人工商业的社会主义改造的基础。有了这样的基础，就能保证我们经过三个五年计划来完成社会主义社会的建设。
    二、五年计划前三年执行的基本情况
    第一个五年计划已经执行了将近三年，由于党和国家的正确领导、全国人民的自觉的辛勤的劳动以及苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私的援助，三年中（根据一九五三年、一九五四年的实际执行结果和一九五五年的预计），我们在国民经济的各个方面都已有了很大的成绩，在相互结合着的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造两个方面都取得了很大的胜利。三年的成就，已经形成了我国整个国民经济的高涨。
    现在分别说明如下：
      （一）基本建设方面：以发展重工业为中心的五年基本建设的规模是巨大的。五年内进行的限额以上的工业建设单位为六百九十四个，其中有四百八十五个要在一九五七年底以前投入生产，它们将能生产出我国历史上从未生产过的许多新产品。在这四百八十五个工业建设单位中，预计在一九五五年前投入生产的是二百七十一个。这些单位投入生产后，我国工业的生产能力就有较大的增加。仅就中央各部主管的新建企业来看：三年中，煤的年产能力增加二千六百万吨以上，发电能力增加九十多万瓩，石油的年产能力增加九十八万吨，生铁的年产能力增加一百四十二万吨，钢的年产能力增加七十四万吨，发电机的年产能力增加二十万瓩。变压器的年产能力增加二百万千伏安，造纸机的年产能力增加三万三千吨，纱锭增加七十五万个，布机增加二万二千台。其他有色金属工业、化学工业、轻工业的主要产品的生产能力都有较大的增长。
    五年计划中新建铁路要铺轨四千零八十四公里，前三年完成铺轨约二千五百公里。此外，前三年铁路机车增加二百八十四台，客车增加一千三百九十台，货车增加一万八千八百辆。五年计划中中央投资建设的公路建设的通车里程为七千公里以上，而前三年通车的里程已达六千九百公里。五年计划规定内河和海洋的船舶要增加四十万吨载重量，前三年已增加了十九万吨载重量。三年中各种运输能力的迅速增长，适应了国民经济建设的需要。
    前三年，我们已经开荒二千三百万亩。和农业合作化运动发展的同时，全民所有制的拖拉机站已由一九五三年的十一个发展到一九五五年的一百十二个，拥有的拖拉机由一百十三台增加到一千八百九十六台（标准台）。国营机械农场，一九五二年是五十个、有耕地二百零三万亩、拖拉机一千五百三十一台（标准台）；一九五五年预计发展到一百零六个、可有耕地四百十五万亩，拖拉机三千零十二台（标准台）。
    在水利建设方面，三年内已完工的有永定河的官厅水库和淮河的南湾、薄山、佛子岭等四个水库，蓄水量共达三十九亿多公方。
    可见，三年的基本建设已经获得了巨大的成就。
      （二）工业生产方面：全国工业总产值，一九五五年预计比一九五二年增长百分之六十二左右，平均每年增长百分之十七点五。大家知道五年计划中规定五年内工业产值要增长百分之九十八点三，即平均每年增长百分之十四点七，可见五年的工业生产的总产值计划是可以超额完成的。
    工业主要产品产量的增长也很快。举例来说，一九五五年比一九五二年，铁约增长百分之九十四，钢增长百分之九十九多，钢材增长百分之一百十三，发电量约增长百分之七十三，原煤增长百分之四十六，原油增长百分之一百二十以上，双轮双铧犁增长一百零四倍等等。
    三年中增长的产值，主要是依靠发挥原有企业的潜力得来的。这种情况要到第二个五年计划时，才能发生很大变化，但是，就是到那个时候，原有企业的生产潜力也还会是大的。因此，当我们集中主要力量进行基本建设的同时，决不能忽视加强对原有企业的管理和生产领导。
    三年来的经验证明，工业的发展虽然快，但仍然有两个问题影响着工业速度的进一步增长。在重工业方面，主要是技术不高，许多需要的新产品不能制造；在轻工业方面，主要是原材料不足。因此，提高技术水平，改进产品质量，增加新品种，节约原材料，扩大原料资源，对于工业增产就有着很大的意义。
    三年来国营工业增加的产值中，依靠提高劳动生产率取得的约占了百分之六十六，依靠增加工人取得的约占百分之三十四。劳动生产率的提高，归根到底是保证社会主义胜利的重要因素。因此，我们必须坚定不移地贯彻优先发展重工业的方针，使我们有可能不断地以新的设备来改造全部工业和整个国民经济；必须精通技术，使设备充分地发挥作用。必须提高每个职工的社会主义觉悟，努力学习技术，发挥生产的积极性和创造性。
    （三）农业生产方面：全国农业总产值一九五五年预计比一九五二年增长百分之十左右，其中粮食产量增长约百分之九，技术作物的产值增长约百分之十。
    三年来，农业生产增长的速度是不高的，这也充分说明了整个农业生产在没有从私有的、落后的、分散经营的小农经济转变到合作化、机械化的巨大农业经济以前，因为受小生产条件的限制，增长的速度还是不可能很快的。但是，农业是国民经济的两个主要部门之一，如果农业赶不上，就会使整个国民经济发生巨大的影响，因此克服困难，完成农业的增产任务有着极其重大的意义。我们在计划合作化运动的发展时，同时必须计划农业的增产，因为合作化是应当保证农业增产的，而农业的增产又能巩固和推动合作化运动。
    五年计划所规定的农业增产任务是艰巨的，但是完成任务并力争超过的有利条件也是存在的。这些条件就是：农民社会主义积极性的提高和农业合作化运动的高潮；社会主义工业化的前进和工业对农业支援的加强；党和政府对农业生产领导的加强。这些条件都是带有根本性的，经常起作用的，而且是正处在发展中的。有了这些有利条件，各种农业的增产措施就能合理的实施，存在于农业中的巨大潜力就会得到很好的发挥。
    （四）在运输交通和商品流通方面：我国总的货运量（包括铁路、航运、汽车、航空的货运量）一九五五年预计比一九五二年增长百分之七十左右。总的客运量增长百分之五十一。社会商品零售总额约增长百分之五十点三。可见三年内运输交通和商品流通的增长也是不慢的。
    （五）劳动生产率、工资和劳保福利方面：一九五五年预计比一九五二年，国营工业的劳动生产率增长百分之五十一点五；全国平均工资增长百分之二十点五；劳保福利经费（包括工资附加和企业奖励基金）增加约百分之一百十三。
    （六）文化教育方面：一九五五年预计比一九五二年，高等学校在校人数增长百分之五十一
  （即增加九万八千三百人），高级中学的在校人数增加百分之一百二十四（即增加三十二万二千多人），初级中学的在校人数增加百分之五十二（即增加一百一十六万三千多人），小学生在校人数增长百分之七点七（即增加三百九十二万人）。各种文化出版事业也有很大的发展。如果和国民党反动统治时期相比较，我们三年来在文化教育方面所作的事，总起来说是超过了国民党反动派统治时期的二十年。这只有在人民掌握了政权而且向着社会主义前进的时候，才有这样的奇迹。
    从三年来我国工业的发展情况中，我们可以得出结论，我国已朝着社会主义工业化的方向积极地前进了一步。
      （一）现代工业在工农业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之二十六点七上升到一九五五年预计的百分之三十三以上。
      （二）国营工业在工业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之五十二点八上升到一九五五年预计的百分之六十一以上；合作社营工业所占的比重，已由百分之三点二升到一九五五年的百分之四点四；公私合营工业所占的比重已由百分之五上升到预计的百分之十五；而私营工业所占的比重，则由百分之三十九下降为预计的百分之十八左右。
    （三）生产资料产值在工业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之三十九点七上升到一九五五年预计的百分之四十五。
    （四）我国的工业正朝着独立制造的方向前进。机械工业产值在工业总产值中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之五点二上升到一九五四年的百分之六点三。我国已能生产许多过去从来不能生产的新产品。
    三年的建设，同时已使我国国民经济在社会主义改造道路上前进了一步。
    （一）农村合作化运动，在党的积极的有计划的领导下，已经得到了迅速的发展。全国的农业生产合作社一九五二年仅三千六百多个，入社农户仅五万九千多户，但到一九五五年六月，已经发展到六十五万个社（经过整顿后的数），入社农户已达
  一千六百九十万户。
    农业生产合作社已充分地表现出它的优越性。在现有的六十五万个社中，百分之八十的社是增产的，百分之十几的社是不增不减的，百分之几的社是减产的。但是可以肯定，这百分之十几的第一年不增不减和减产的社，经过整顿后，第二年就可能改进，很多就能增产。
    劳动农民，首先是占农村人口百分之六十到七十的贫农、新中农中间的下中农和老中农中间的下中农，特别是这几部分人中间的积极分子，他们已通过亲眼看到的事实，逐渐地认识了农业生产合作社的优越性。毛主席在最近指示说：“在全国农村中，新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来。”又说：“我们应当积极地热情地有计划地去领导这个运动”。农村中的青年积极分子，应该成为这个运动中的先锋突击力量。
    （二）手工业生产合作社也有一定的发展。全国现有城乡手工业人数近九百万人，在一九五二年参加手工业生产合作社的人数为二十二万人，产值为二点四亿多元；一九五五年的预计，人数增到九十万人，产值增到十三亿六千万元。另外带有某些社会主义萌芽的手工业生产小组，三年中也有发展。
      （三）各种形式的国家资本主义有很大的发展。在工业方面预计到一九五五年止，在三年中已有相当于一九五二年私营大型工业产值百分之三十六的私营工业企业已经转变为公私合营。一九五五年上半年，在私营大型工业产值中，由国家加工、订货、统购、包销和收购的产品价值约占百分之九十三。在商业方面，私营商业在社会零售总额中所占的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之六十五点九下降到一九五五年预计的百分之四十五点九。而这百分之四十五点九中间，有百分之十三点四是属于经销代销和合营的。批发阵地已基本上由社会主义商业所掌握了。
    （四）社会主义经济向前发展的结果，国家财政收入中来自国营经济和供销合作社（税收）的比重，已由一九五二年的百分之五十九上升到一九五五年预计的百分之七十四。这就使得国家的财政收入有了更稳固的基础。
    从三年的计划执行情况中，我们总的应该得出什么样的结论呢？这些结论就是：
    三年来工业发展的速度是很快的。
    三年来社会主义改造特别是农业的社会主义改造的进展是很快的。
    三年来我国的经济面貌的改变是迅速的。
    三年的经验证明，第一个五年计划一定能够完成，经过三个五年计划以后，社会主义社会一定能够建成。
    社会主义是无限美好的，但是在社会主义建设的道路上并不是没有困难的。完成社会主义建设的过程，同时也是一个不断克服困难的艰苦奋斗的过程。
    社会主义有着无限的优越性，但社会主义决不会和和平平地不遇到任何阻力就能到来，相反的，只有通过复杂的阶级斗争才能实现。五年计划就是一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。
    党的领导，是社会主义胜利的保证。群众特别是工农群众觉悟的不断提高，是实现社会主义的力量的依靠。在党领导下的觉悟了的群众的面前，任何困难都得低头，任何敌人只有失败。
    三、今后两年的任务
    从五年计划前三年的执行情况中可以看出，我们在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业中，已经取得了巨大的成绩。但另一方面我们还必须看到：五年计划留给后两年的任务还是很繁重的，特别在农业方面和基本建设方面，后两年的任务还更要紧张。因之，要胜利地完成第一个五年计划，我们还必须比过去三年作更大的努力。全国人民当前的任务，就是要以坚持不懈的努力和忘我的劳动来争取完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，迎接社会主义建设的新高潮。
    按照第一个五年计划的要求，在今后两年有些怎样的具体任务呢？
      （一）基本建设方面：五年计划规定的工作总量，前三年已完成百分之五十二，后两年必须继续完成的是百分之四十八。仅一九五六年，开始施工和继续施工的限额以上的厂矿建设单位就有五百五十五个，其中预定在一九五六年完工的有一百六十二个单位，比过去三年累计的完工单位还要多四十七个。五年计划中规模最大、技术最复杂的建设工程，自一九五六年起将要全面铺开、在苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个建设单位中，明年同时进行施工的就有一百十八个。
      （二）工业生产方面：今后两年的全国工业总产值，将要比一九五五年增加百分之二十二，主要工业品产量都将有很大增长。
    （三）农业生产方面：今后两年主要农作物产量的增长比例为：粮食增加百分之八左右，棉花增加百分之二十五左右，其他黄洋麻、烤烟、甘蔗、花生等都有很大增长。
      （四）运输业方面：各个运输部门的货运量要求比一九五五年增长百分之二十八，客运量增长百分之十六左右。新建铁路的铺轨里程如果包括追加的工程在内，则后两年将增加三、三○○公里，轮船增加二十一万吨。
      （五）商业方面：社会商品零售总额将比一九五五年增加百分之二十左右。
      （六）文化教育方面：高等学校的在校学生数比一九五五年要求增加百分之五十，中等专业学校和高中的在校学生数要求各增加百分之二十四，初中的在校学生数要求增加百分之十七点四。
    从上面这些主要指标中可以看出，五年计划后两年的具体任务仍是很繁重的。在这些指标中，有些指标的增长比例很高，我们必须尽最大的努力来保证完成；有些指标的增长比例虽较低，但也应该在年度计划中根据需要和可能，随时准备提高，以争取五年计划的超额完成。
    现在，我们来展望一下一九五六年的经济情况和完成五年计划的有利条件。
    根据各方面的情况来估计，今年的农业生产将是一个丰收年，只要秋收季节不发生意外的灾害，今年的棉、粮生产就可以完成计划。全国农民应该再接再厉，争取完成和超额完成国家计划。
    在农业丰收的基础上，今年第四季度和明年的经济情况将更为活跃。由于农业丰收，就使我们有可能将明年的工业生产指标定得更积极些。工业生产的增加，反过来又可以供给农民更多的生活资料和生产资料，促进农业的发展，促使城乡交流和市场的进一步活跃。在工农业加速发展和市场更加活跃的基础上，国家的积累也将随着增加，从而使我们有可能以更多的资金投入建设。所有这些，必然会促进今后两年的工农业生产和国民经济的进一步高涨；人民的生活也将有进一步的改善，职工的平均工资和农民的货币收入将有所增加。
    一九五六年是完成第一个五年计划最有决定意义的一年，我们应当将一九五六年的年度计划定得比一九五五年更积极一些，并保证其完成。
    我们具有那些有利的条件来保证完成一九五六年计划和第一个五年计划呢？
    （一）总路线的提出、宪法的制定和第一个五年计划的公布，党和毛主席的正确领导，极大地鼓舞了全国人民的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的热情，依靠广大人民的这种热情，我们就可以克服实现五年计划过程中可能遇到的任何困难，保证五年计划的胜利完成。
      （二）社会主义的工业将进一步发展，私人资本主义工业将进一步得到改造，社会主义的经济基础日益增强。因而就能够更加有力地来推动整个国民经济的高涨。
      （三）农村中合作化运动的高涨，农业社会主义改造的步骤和各种政策的妥善安排，党对农业生产和农村工作领导的加强，农村中社会主义基础的加强，国家对农业投资的增加，工业对农业的支援增大，以及全国农民生产积极性的提高，就使我们有条件来争取连续三年的农业丰收。
    （四）由于节约运动的成绩很大，使我们有可能以节约的资金来将制定五年计划时因限于投资而推迟的建设项目重新提前，从而使国民经济的各方面更能适应，更能得到协调的、迅速的发展。
    （五）在国民经济的各个方面，在工农业生产和基本建设的各个环节上，我们还有很大的潜在力量，只要全国人民首先是青年善于发挥自己的积极性和创造性，推广先进经验，努力学习技术，克服落后环节，我们就可以保证工农业增产任务的完成。
      （六）三个年度计划执行的经验，使我们对客观的经济情况和发展规律，有了更多的认识，各方面的工作也有所提高。这样就使我们主观方面有了更充分的条件来争取五年计划的完成，并为第二个五年计划打下良好的基础。
    毛主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中教导我们说：“我国人民应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。
    我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。
    领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。
    指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。
    我们有充分的信心，克服一切艰难困苦，将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国。”
    我们一定要遵循着毛主席的指示，继续前进！要加强政治学习，提高警惕，粉碎敌人的破坏阴谋；要加强技术文化学习，提高工作能力；要发扬积极性和创造性，组织劳动竞赛，努力增产节约；要戒骄戒躁，团结全体青年和全国人民努力完成第一个五年计划。
