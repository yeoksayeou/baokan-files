Supporting the Interim Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas

    After Grain "Three Fixes" Implemented to Households in Jiande and Other Places
    Wu Maying, Xiang Quanjun
    In the Jiande Special District of Zhejiang Province, from late June to early August, seventy townships completed the pilot work of the "three fixes" (定产, 定购, 定销 - fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales) down to the township level. Facts have proved that implementing the "three fixes" of grain down to the household level is the urgent requirement of the vast number of rural workers and peasant masses, and an important measure to promote various rural tasks, inspire peasants' enthusiasm for production, and ensure the completion of grain purchase tasks.
    After vigorously publicizing the benefits of the "three fixes" for grain and setting the figures for grain production, purchase, and sales down to the cooperative and household levels in these areas, a new atmosphere emerged in all aspects. The peasant masses, knowing how much grain they would produce and sell to the state, how much they would retain for their own use, and how much the state would supply in the next three years, dispelled their concerns and dissatisfaction about "producing more and selling more surplus grain" and "surplus grain not being glorious, and unified purchase having no bottom line," and warmly supported the "three fixes" policy. The peasants in these areas generally reflected: Chairman Mao considers things very thoughtfully, and the methods are becoming more and more reasonable; he has done everything we wanted in our hearts. Farmers in Qinchuan Township, Sui'an County, said: "The 'three fixes' are a treasure for peace of mind." Farmers in Genglou Township, Shouchang County, spoke their minds: "In the past, we felt that surplus grain households were not as good as grain-deficient households, but now we are only afraid of harvesting too little grain." Before the "three fixes," some households who deliberately claimed to be short of grain no longer did so, and many surplus grain households dared to take out grain for consumption. For example, farmer Yu Yecai from Youban Village, Anyang Township, Sui'an County, had two dou of corn, but because he was afraid of others knowing, he secretly ground it at home by hand. After hearing the policy propaganda, he immediately took it to the large stone mortar to grind it. In Yangxi Village, Yangxi Township, Jiande County, more than thirty farmers originally followed the staff to ask for grain supply certificates. After the "three fixes" to households, only one truly grain-deficient household asked for it, while the remaining households followed the farmers' association director to request certificates for purchasing fertilizer. Many grassroots workers had a fear of difficulty in grain work before the "three fixes" to households, reflecting that "no matter how good the grain 'three fixes' are, anything with 'grain' at the beginning is always difficult to handle." After the "three fixes" to households, their confidence in their work was increased. In Qinchuan and Anyang Townships, Sui'an County, during the "three fixes," forty-seven party and Communist Youth League backbone members who were originally passive and retreated in their work changed their attitude and worked actively. Some rural workers in Shuinan Township, Chun'an County, reflected: "Once the 'three fixes' are settled, we can concentrate on agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation."
    The peasant masses realized that the more grain they produced in the next three years, the more grain they would retain for their own use, so their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. They actively revised their production increase plans, accumulated and purchased large amounts of fertilizer, and expanded the area for grain cultivation. For example, after the "three fixes" task was assigned to the Shuangrang Agricultural Cooperative in Anzhong Township, Tonglu County, it successively convened cooperative affairs management committees and cooperative member meetings to tap potential and find key points for increasing production, aiming to increase grain production by another 4,200 jin on the basis of the original plan. Before the "three fixes," many farmers in Dongxi Township, Fenshui County, were afraid of "producing more and unified purchasing more," and more than 100 mu of dry land that could be converted into paddy fields were not converted. After implementing the "three fixes" to households, although farm work was very tight at the time, they still seized the time to convert 107 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The Qianwan Agricultural Cooperative in this township converted 12 mu of dry land into paddy fields overnight in the moonlight. During the implementation of the "three fixes" to households in Qinchuan and Anyang Townships, more than 800 large and small water conservancy projects damaged by floods were repaired, more than 1,500 mu were treated for pests, 91 mu were reclaimed, and the planting of corn and sweet potatoes was expanded by more than 990 mu. Some farmers in Anyang Township regretted that they had not worked hard in production before the "three fixes." They reflected: "If the 'three fixes' had been implemented earlier, everyone would have increased grain production by an unknown amount this year!" Chen Yougen, a lazy man in Xitou Village, Baisha Township, Jiande County, who had always been inactive in production and did not purchase fertilizer, also bought ten jin of fertilizer powder after the "three fixes." He said: "Now we have to rely on real skills to eat." His wife told everyone she met: "The 'three fixes' have also cured the lazy disease of lazy people."
    With the improvement of production enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation also increased. They understood that if they participated in agricultural cooperatives, more production would be their own, and some cooperative members who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative also gave up the idea. For example, twenty cooperative members from three agricultural cooperatives in Tangcun Township, Shouchang County, originally planned to withdraw from the cooperatives after the autumn harvest, but after the "three fixes," they expressed their firm determination to take the road of collectivization. In Anyang Township, fifty-six farmers who had already withdrawn from the cooperative reapplied to join. According to statistics from Anyang, Dongxi, Yangxi, Baisha, Longqiao and other five townships, nine cooperatives were consolidated and restored, and twenty-eight mutual aid teams were restored and developed during the implementation of the "three fixes."
    In the grain "three fixes" to households, because the production was determined in a pragmatic manner and the farmers were given sufficient rations, seeds, and feed, and the farmers would still have a certain amount of surplus grain after the purchase, the farmers generally felt that it was fair and reasonable and expressed their determination to complete the state's assigned purchase tasks. The words of farmer Wu Dewang from Laocun Township, Shouchang County, can represent the feelings of ordinary farmers. He said: "Now we have to sell even if we are not called to sell surplus grain." According to the statistics of the "three fixes" in fourteen townships in eight counties, the amount of grain submitted after offsetting the purchase and sales this year increased by an average of 17.96% compared to the amount submitted last year, laying a good foundation for completing the grain purchase task after the autumn harvest.
    At present, on the basis of the conclusion of the pilot work of the "three fixes" to households in various counties in the Jiande Special District, experiences are being summarized, cadres are being trained, forces are being organized, and preparations are being made to carry out the "three fixes" to households in batches throughout the district.

专栏：拥护农村粮食统购统销暂行办法

    建德等地粮食三定到户以后
    吴马瀛  项全均
    浙江省建德专区自六月下旬到八月初这一段时期内，已有七十个乡完成了三定到乡的试点工作。事实证明：粮食三定到户，是广大乡村工作人员和农民群众的迫切要求，是推动农村各项工作、鼓舞农民生产情绪、保证粮食征购任务完成的重要措施。
    这些地区经过大张旗鼓地宣传粮食三定的好处并将粮食产、购、销数字定到了社和户后，各方面都出现了新的气象。农民群众知道在今后三年内自己生产粮食卖给国家多少，自己留用多少，国家供应多少，解除了“多增产、多卖余粮”、“余粮不光荣、统购没有底”的顾虑和不满情绪，热烈拥护三定政策。这些地区的农民普遍反映：毛主席考虑真周到，办法越来越合理；把我们心里想的事都办到了。遂安县芹川乡的农民说：“三定是安心宝。”寿昌县更楼乡的农民说出了他们心里的话：“过去觉得余粮户不如缺粮户，现在是只怕收的粮食太少。”三定前，有些故意说缺粮的户不再说缺粮了，不少余粮户敢于把粮食拿出来吃用了。如遂安县安阳乡游坂村农民余业材家有两斗玉米，因怕别人知道，偷偷在家里用手磨磨着吃，听了政策宣传，马上拿到大碓里去磨了。建德县洋溪乡洋溪村原来有三十多个农民跟着工作人员要粮食供应证，三定到户后，只一户真正缺粮户要，其余的户却跟着农会主任要求开证明购买肥料了。有好多基层工作人员在三定到户前，对粮食工作有畏难情绪，反映“不管粮食三定怎么好，凡是‘粮’字带头总难搞”。三定到户后，提高了工作信心。遂安县芹川、安阳两个乡在三定中，有四十七个原来工作消极退缩的党、团员骨干分子，转变了态度积极工作。淳安县水南乡有些乡村工作人员反映：三定定下来，就能专心搞农业生产和互助合作了。
    农民群众认识到在今后三年内，生产的粮食越多，自己留用的粮食也就越多，因而生产积极性空前提高，他们积极修订增产计划，大量积肥购肥，扩大粮食种植面积。如桐庐县安中乡双让农业合作社在三定任务到社后，即先后召开社务管理委员会、社员大会，挖潜力，找增产关键，要在原计划基础上，再增产粮食四千二百斤。分水县东溪乡在三定前不少农民怕“多增产，多统购”，有一百多亩能改水田的旱地也没改，贯彻了三定到户工作后，虽然当时农活很紧张，他们还抓紧把一百零七亩旱地改成了水田。这个乡前湾农业合作社在月光下连夜把十二亩旱地改成水田。芹川、安阳两个乡在贯彻三定到户工作期间，修好了被洪水冲坏的大小水利工程八百多处，治虫一千五百多亩，开荒九十一亩，扩种玉米、甘薯九百九十多亩。安阳乡有些农民后悔自己在三定前没有努力生产，他们反映：早日三定，大家今年不知要增产多少粮食！建德县白沙乡溪头村一向不积极生产、不购买肥料的懒汉陈有根，三定后也买了十斤肥田粉，他说：“现在要靠真本领吃饭了。”他的老婆逢人便说：“三定把懒人的懒病也治好了。”
    随着生产积极性的提高，农民参加互助合作的积极性也随之提高。他们懂得参加农业合作社生产多了都是自己的，有些原来想退社的社员也不退社了。如寿昌县唐村乡三个农业合作社原来有二十个社员打算秋后退社，三定后表示坚决走合作化的道路。安阳乡有五十六户已退社的农民又重新要求入社。据安阳、东溪、洋溪、白沙、龙桥等五个乡的统计，在贯彻三定工作中巩固和恢复了九个社，恢复发展了二十八个互助组。
    在粮食三定到户工作中，由于实事求是地进行了定产，并给农民留足了口粮、种籽、饲料，征购后农民将还有一定数量的余粮，农民普遍感到公平合理，表示要坚决完成国家定购的任务。寿昌县劳村乡农民吴德旺的话可以代表一般农民的心情。他说：“现在不叫卖余粮也要卖了。”据八个县十四个乡三定结果统计，今年粮食征购销相抵后的上缴数，比去年上缴数平均增加百分之十七点九六，为秋后完成粮食征购任务打下了良好的基础。
    目前建德专区各县在粮食三定到户试点工作结束的基础上，总结经验，训练干部，组织力量，准备在全区范围内分批开展粮食三定到户工作。
