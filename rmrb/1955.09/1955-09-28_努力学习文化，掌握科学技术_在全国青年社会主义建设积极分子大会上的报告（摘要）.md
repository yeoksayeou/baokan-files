Strive to Learn Culture and Master Science and Technology
——Report at the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism (Abstract)
Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

Here, I mainly want to talk to you about the learning tasks facing the youth of the whole country during the socialist construction period of our great motherland.

One of the tasks of Chinese youth in socialist construction is to continuously improve socialist consciousness and, under the guidance of socialist ideology, actively learn culture and master science and technology in order to better build our motherland.

I. Why is learning culture and mastering scientific and technological knowledge so important?

As everyone knows, the socialist construction we are undertaking in our country is based on socialist industrialization. Closely related to this is the cooperation and mechanization of agriculture. It is impossible to participate in modern production labor without culture and without understanding technology. Improving cultural level is a necessary condition for improving technical level and improving labor productivity. In terms of industry, my country is building and expanding a large number of large-scale enterprises, all of which are large-scale modern industries with vast scales and complex technologies. To build and manage these industries, a large number of specialized talents and skilled technical workers are required. Without the necessary technical strength, the construction of these industries cannot be completed smoothly, and the socialist industrialization of our country cannot be realized. In agriculture, the need for cultural and scientific knowledge is also becoming increasingly urgent. Not only does agricultural cooperation require a large number of production management personnel with a certain level of culture, but also the reform of agricultural technology is gradually being carried out, and the use of large-scale agricultural machinery will gradually increase. After eight or nine years, that is, during the Third Five-Year Plan period, agriculture will be mechanized on a large scale. If our rural areas still maintain a large number of illiterates, the mechanization of agriculture will encounter many difficulties. At the same time, in order to successfully defend socialist construction, we must have a strong and modern national defense force. If our soldiers do not have the necessary cultural and scientific knowledge, it will be impossible for them to master modern technical equipment. In order to further develop our country's culture, education, health, and scientific research, we must also have a large number of teachers, medical and health personnel, literary and artistic workers, scientific research workers, and so on. In short, we must see that in all aspects of socialist construction, there is a need for a large and ever-increasing number of educated laborers and experts who have mastered science and technology. As early as 1920, Lenin pointed out to the youth of the Soviet Union: "The task before you is to economically revive the whole country, to transform and restore agriculture and industry on the basis of modern science and technology, on the basis of electrical modern technology." He also pointed out: "He must realize that only on the basis of modern knowledge can he build a communist society, and if he does not understand this knowledge, communism will always be just a wish." The youth of the Soviet Union, following Lenin's important instructions, conquered the strongholds of science and technology and built the world's first powerful socialist country. The path taken by Soviet youth in learning is exactly the path that Chinese youth must take. Chairman Mao also said in his opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "Our people should work hard, study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, be honest and diligent, encourage and help each other, and guard against any exaggeration and arrogance, and prepare to build our current economically and culturally backward country into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture within a few five-year plans."

II. In order to cultivate the cadres needed for socialist construction and improve the cultural level of the broad masses of working people, the Party and the People's Government have carried out tremendous work in the past few years. On the one hand, they have vigorously developed schools at all levels and of all types, and on the other hand, they have held various kinds of spare-time education. This has opened up unprecedentedly broad paths for the cultural, scientific, and technological learning of the broad masses of young people and all workers and peasants.

Here, I want to talk about the issue of spare-time learning.

Through higher education institutions, secondary specialized schools, and general school education, it is an important aspect of solving the problem of learning. Another important aspect is to hold various kinds of spare-time education. For the vast number of on-the-job cadres and workers and peasants, spare-time learning is an important learning method that must be adopted.

First of all, eliminating illiteracy is a huge task. Illiteracy accounts for the majority of the population, which is a significant sign of our country's cultural backwardness. The number of illiterate young and middle-aged people in our country accounts for as much as 75% to 80%. Not only do illiterates account for the vast majority in rural areas, but there are also a large number of illiterates in many industrial and mining enterprises. We must adopt a positive policy to carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy. First of all, we must take effective measures to eliminate illiteracy among workers and staff members of industrial and mining enterprises on a regular basis. From the founding of the country to the end of 1954, about 1.1 million illiterates had been eliminated among workers and staff members nationwide, and a small number of industrial and mining enterprises had basically eliminated illiteracy. The improvement of the cultural level of workers and staff members has not only played a positive role in improving technology and increasing production, but also created conditions for further learning of new production technologies. However, at present, illiterates still account for about 50% of the workers and staff members in modern industrial and mining enterprises, while illiterates account for more than 60% of the workers and staff members in industries such as coal mines. In order to further improve the technical level of workers and create a technical knowledge class of their own among the working class, we must continue to systematically and conscientiously eliminate illiteracy among workers and staff members. During the First Five-Year Plan period, we must strive to basically eliminate illiteracy among the existing workers and staff members in the industrial sector, or at least eliminate most of the illiteracy. The high tide of the social reform of agricultural cooperation is coming in some areas, and it will soon come nationwide. In order to meet and cooperate with the arrival of this high tide, we must closely follow up with the work of spare-time cultural education and illiteracy elimination for farmers. We have already proposed that we must basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in rural areas during the transition period, and strive to eliminate illiteracy among rural cadres, activists, cooperative members, and some non-members within three to five years. According to the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas and the experience of carrying out illiteracy elimination work in some areas, it is necessary to appropriately accelerate the progress of illiteracy elimination work. As long as we actively create conditions and take effective measures, it is also possible to do so. In order to appropriately accelerate the work of illiteracy elimination in rural areas, we should further attach importance to carrying out year-round learning in the future. We should enable all those who participate in illiteracy elimination and cultural learning to gradually consolidate and continuously improve in year-round learning. Overcome the phenomenon of irregular learning, "winter school every year, learning from scratch every year." The organization of farmers' cultural learning must be combined with the organization of production, that is, with the organization of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. We must organize farmers to study in effective forms according to the characteristics of agricultural production and seasons. We can advocate more formal year-round spare-time cultural schools, or we can adopt various decentralized groups and methods of one-on-one teaching and learning. I think that farmers' spare-time cultural schools can become the main form and center of farmers' spare-time learning in the future.

It must be pointed out that the work of eliminating illiteracy is a basic component of the cultural revolution during the transition period in our country, and it is of great significance for the successful completion of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country; at the same time, it is also a huge mass work, and to complete this task, we must mobilize various social forces to carry it out. We hope that all young people, those who cannot read should actively participate in learning and eliminate illiteracy first, and young people with culture should strive to do illiteracy elimination work. During the First Five-Year Plan period, each young person with culture should eliminate at least one illiterate, I think it is easy to do. Let us all work together to first eliminate illiteracy among young people and adults.

In order to carry out spare-time learning, the government will vigorously run formal spare-time schools from elementary school to university in schools, factories, mines, institutions, and enterprises on the basis of past spare-time education, so that the vast number of workers and staff members can systematically learn culture and science and technology in their spare time. We will also use the method of running correspondence education to absorb factory and mine cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers to study. The learning in all these spare-time schools should be gradually done with a formal system, and full guarantees should be given in terms of study time, teachers, teaching materials, funding, and leadership, especially the guarantee of study time. The experience of many factories and mines has proven that because those who participate in spare-time learning have practical production experience, as long as it is done well, spare-time education can achieve good results. However, some people's understanding of spare-time learning is insufficient. They always think that spare-time learning is not good, and if they want to learn, they should enter ordinary middle schools and universities. This idea is divorced from reality. Entering middle school and university is certainly an important learning path, but the experience of the past few years has proven that under the conditions in China today, it is difficult for outstanding worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers to leave their jobs for a long time to study in large numbers. The policy of carrying out the cultural education of worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant masses with spare-time learning as the main method has expanded the scope of worker-peasant education, made the channels for cultivating worker-peasant cadres broader and more effective, and enabled truly outstanding worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant masses to have more opportunities for education. This is completely in line with the needs and actual situation of socialist construction in our country.

We must actively create conditions, overcome all difficulties, and carry out the cause of spare-time education. I hope that the comrades attending this conference will play a leading role in this regard, set an example, and promote the vast number of worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant masses to actively participate in spare-time learning, learn their skills, and further welcome the high tide of socialist construction.

III. In order to encourage labor and learning, and in order to improve cultural level, young people must also actively participate in mass spare-time cultural and artistic activities. According to the statistics at the end of 1954, in terms of workers' mass spare-time cultural organizations, there were more than 13,000 workers' clubs (more than 16 times more than in 1950), more than 8,600 radio stations, more than 17,000 libraries, more than 7,700 amateur drama troupes, and more than 17,600 other organizations such as music, art, dance, and literature, with nearly 200,000 participants. According to incomplete statistics from 15 provinces in 1954, there were about 63,000 amateur drama troupes and about 3,600 clubs in rural areas. However, the development of mass spare-time cultural and artistic activities is far behind the needs of the broad masses in terms of quantity and quality, and must continue to be vigorously carried out. Government cultural departments must do a lot of work in this regard. All literary and artistic undertakings must implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Theaters should perform more for workers, peasants, and soldiers, movies should be shown more for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and writers should write more for workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, it should be pointed out that to carry out mass spare-time cultural and artistic activities, it is not enough to rely solely on some cultural work departments and professional cultural workers. We must also rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, encourage and support mass literary and artistic creation activities, and cultivate a large number of mass literary and artistic workers from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Government cultural departments, all literary and artistic workers, and various professional literary and artistic groups must regard assisting and guiding the development of mass spare-time cultural and artistic activities as an important task of their own. At the same time, we must strengthen and expand the publication and distribution of popular books and newspapers, and continuously provide the broad masses with cultural nourishment.

In carrying out mass cultural and artistic activities and recreational activities, young comrades should become the backbone. Today, all of you present are active builders of socialism from various positions. Some of you are already, or will be, active members of mass spare-time cultural and artistic activities. I hope that after you go back, you will better develop the spare-time cultural and artistic activities in your area.

IV. While learning culture and science and technology, we must study politics, that is, we must study Marxism-Leninism.

Socialist builders can truly understand the inevitability and justice of the socialist cause and understand the relationship between their work and the socialist cause only if they understand and master the science of Marxism-Leninism regarding the laws of social development. Only in this way they can consciously and voluntarily fight for the realization of the new social system. Anyone who neglects politics and does not study Marxism-Leninism will inevitably lose the correct direction in their work. At present, some people only see the side of urgently needing science and technology for building socialism, and do not see the side of needing to improve political level at the same time. They say: "With technology, you have everything," and "Politics is empty talk, technology is real capital." This kind of thought that is divorced from politics is very harmful. We must learn science and technology under the guidance of a clear political direction, so that science and technology can serve the tasks of the socialist struggle. Therefore, the study of Marxist-Leninist theory must be valued by every young person.

Another important way for the broad masses of young people to improve their socialist consciousness is to actively participate in the current political struggle. In the past few years, the broad masses of young people have been greatly tempered and their consciousness has been raised in major political movements such as land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. In the future, young people should continue to actively participate in practical political struggles and temper themselves in the complex and sharp class struggle, in the struggle to build the motherland and defend the construction of the motherland. The tendency of certain young people to not care about political struggle and not participate in political life must be overcome. At the same time, young people must also pay attention to cultivating their communist moral character and replace individualism with collectivism. Without communist moral character, a young person can never become a useful talent for socialist construction. The process of establishing communist morality is the process of continuously improving communist consciousness and eliminating the influence of bourgeois decadent ideology. Therefore, young people are required to pay attention to drawing a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the bourgeoisie, distinguishing right from wrong, using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, continuously conducting self-education, and gradually improving their level of consciousness.

V. Whether studying at school or participating in spare-time learning, and whether learning culture, science, technology, or politics, we must have a spirit of hard work and eagerness to learn. Especially for current worker-peasant youth, because of the poor original cultural foundation, it is definitely not possible to successfully master modern scientific and technological knowledge in just a year and a half. This is a long-term, arduous, and intense battle process. Without arduous battles, the fortress of science and technology cannot be conquered. Therefore, we must learn honestly and diligently to achieve our goals. Marx once said: "There is no smooth road to science, only those who are not afraid of hardship in climbing the rugged path have the hope of reaching the glorious peak." Chairman Mao said: "Science is an honest and honest knowledge, and any mischief is not allowed." We must remember this important instruction from Marx and Chairman Mao and take out the greatest perseverance to persist in learning.

Here, we must also point out that there are still some people among young people who do not have the correct attitude towards learning. Some people only talk about the importance of learning in words, but in actual actions, they always use various objective reasons to cover up their slackness in learning. Some people often engage in spare-time learning, but they cannot persevere and give up halfway when they encounter difficulties. There is no shortcut to learning, there are no "tricks" to take advantage of, and there is no end to it. We should form a learning atmosphere among young people that is active, hardworking, persistent, and closely linked to reality for the cause of socialism.

Regarding the comrades' learning and work, I would now like to offer three hopes:

First of all, we must love labor and have a correct understanding of the relationship between learning culture and labor. In recent years, some educated youth, after graduating from junior high school or senior elementary school, only want to continue their studies and are unwilling to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor, especially unwilling to participate in agricultural production labor. Some reluctantly participated in labor, but they are not at ease, and always feel that educated youth should no longer engage in production labor. This idea is wrong. In the eyes of the exploiting class, labor is "despicable" work; but in the eyes of our working people, labor is the most glorious cause. Labor is the source of creating everything. The purpose of our learning is to successfully carry out socialist construction, not to abandon labor after learning culture. Of course, it is good to have the possibility of running more schools, so that more people can enter and continue their studies, and to popularize compulsory education in elementary and middle schools as soon as possible. However, this cannot be determined solely by subjective wishes, but is determined by various conditions, mainly the conditions of financial resources and teachers. The state's current expenditure on education is already very large, and the speed of school development is already not slow. If we develop education in isolation regardless of the level of production development, then it is only possible to reduce industrial and agricultural investment, which will delay the speed of socialist construction, which is not allowed.

Secondly, we must love our work and be at ease in our work posts. Building the socialist cause is an extremely great and complex project, which requires millions of people to work hard in coordination with each other. Work in all aspects is needed and is an indispensable part of socialist construction. As long as you work with peace of mind and learn with an open mind, you can make achievements in any post. There is an old saying in China, called "Every trade produces its master." The enthusiasm and wisdom of every young person can be infinitely developed in socialist construction. The convening of our current congress of active builders of socialist youth reflects this truth. However, we should admit that among the broad masses of young people, there are still some people who, although they are working in various work posts, do not understand the relationship between their work and the entire socialist cause. They do not love their work and think that "there is no prospect for development," looking at this mountain and hoping for that mountain, and any young people who have these ideas will definitely not do a good job and will not do a good job of learning. Every young person must work wholeheartedly for the motherland and for the great socialist construction to have their own future. Any individualistic plans are wrong and must be overcome.

Finally, I hope that comrades will always maintain the virtue of humility. Some people have made achievements and creations in their work, and after being praised, they have developed complacency, and complacency is the ideological sentiment of bourgeois individualism. With individualism, they will inevitably be separated from the masses and quickly lose the true color of an activist, which must be guarded against.

We must realize that there is no reason for complacency. We must understand that the cause of socialism and communism is the collective cause of the working people under the leadership of the Party. Any work we do in the socialist cause can only be completed smoothly by relying on the Party, relying on the masses, and relying on various social conditions. Chairman Mao said: "The enemy of learning is one's own satisfaction. To seriously learn something, one must start from not being complacent. For oneself, 'never tired of learning,' for others, 'never tired of teaching'." We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, learn with humility, work hard, and continue to move forward.

    努力学习文化，掌握科学技术
    ——在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上的报告（摘要）
    中华人民共和国国务院第二办公室主任　林枫
    我在这里主要和大家谈谈在我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设时期，全国青年所面临的学习任务问题。
    中国青年在社会主义建设中的任务之一就是要不断提高社会主义觉悟，并在社会主义思想指导下积极地学习文化，掌握科学技术，来更好地建设我们的祖国。
    一、为什么学习文化和掌握科学技术知识有这样大的重要性？
    大家知道，我国所进行的社会主义建设，是以社会主义工业化为基础的。与此密切相联系的是农业的合作化和机械化。参加现代化的生产劳动，没有文化不懂技术是不行的。提高文化水平是提高技术水平，提高劳动生产率的一个必要条件。以工业方面来说，我国正在新建和扩建的大量的大企业，它们都是规模宏大、技术复杂的现代化的大工业，要把这些工业建设起来和管理起来，必须有大量的专门人材和熟练的技术工人；没有必要的技术力量，这些工业建设就不可能顺利地完成，我国的社会主义工业化也就无法实现。在农业方面，文化科学知识的需要也日益迫切。不仅由于农业的合作化需要大批具有一定文化水平的生产管理人员，而且农业技术的改革正在逐步进行，大型农业机器的使用也将逐步加多，在八、九年之后，即在第三个五年计划时期，农业即将大规模地机械化。如果我们的农村仍然保持大量的文盲，农业的机械化就要遇到很多困难。同时，要胜利地保卫社会主义建设，必须有强大的现代化的国防军，如果我们的战士没有必要的文化科学知识，也就不可能掌握现代化的技术装备。为了进一步发展我国的文化、教育、卫生和科学研究事业，也必须有大量的教师、医药卫生人员、文学艺术工作者、科学研究工作者等等。总之，我们必须看到，在社会主义建设的各个方面，都需要有大量的日益加多的有文化教养的、掌握科学技术的劳动者和专门家。列宁远在一九二○年就曾经向苏联的青年指出：“你们面前的任务，就是要在经济上复兴全国，就是要在基于现代科学和技术、基于电气的现代技术基础上，来改造和恢复农业与工业。”他又指出：“他必须认清，只有在现代知识基础上，他才能建立共产主义社会，如果他不通晓这种知识，那共产主义就始终不过是一种愿望而已。”苏联的青年，正是遵循了列宁这个重要的指示，攻下了科学和技术的堡垒，建成了世界上第一个社会主义的强大国家。苏联青年在学习上走过的道路，正是中国青年要走的道路。毛主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕词里也说：“我国人民应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。”二、为了培养社会主义建设所需要的干部和提高广大劳动人民的文化水平，党和人民政府几年来进行了巨大的工作。一方面大力发展了各级各类学校，另一方面又举办了各种业余教育。这样就给广大的青少年和全体工农群众的文化科学技术的学习，开辟了空前广阔的道路。
    这里，我要谈谈关于业余学习的问题。
    通过高等学校、中等专业学校和普通学校教育，是解决学习问题的一个重要方面。另外一个重要方面是举办各种业余教育。对于广大在职干部和工农群众来说，业余学习是必须采取的重要的学习办法。
    首先，扫除文盲是一个巨大的任务。文盲占人口中的大多数，这是我国文化落后的一个显著的标志。我国青壮年中文盲人数竟占百分之七十五至八十。不仅农村中文盲占绝大多数，在许多工矿企业中也有大量的文盲存在。我们必须采取积极的方针进行扫除文盲的工作。首先，必须采取切实有效的办法定期扫除工矿企业职工中的文盲。从开国到一九五四年底为止，在全国职工中已扫除文盲约一百一十万人，有少数工矿企业已基本上扫除了文盲。职工文化水平的提高，不但已对目前改进技术、提高生产起了良好的作用，同时也为进一步学习新的生产技术创造了条件。但是目前在现代化的工矿企业的职工中文盲还占百分之五十左右，煤矿等产业职工中的文盲则占百分之六十以上。为了进一步提高工人的技术水平，造就工人阶级自己的技术知识界，必须继续有计划地认真地扫除职工中的文盲。在第一个五年计划期内，我们要争取做到基本上扫除产业部门现有职工中的文盲，至少要做到扫除大部分的文盲。目前农业合作化的社会改革的高潮，有些地区已经到来，全国范围内也即将到来，为了迎接和配合这个高潮的到来，我们必须把农民业余文化教育工作和扫盲工作紧紧地跟上去。我们已经提出了：要在过渡时期内基本上扫除农村中青壮年的文盲，争取在三、五年内，扫除乡村干部积极分子、合作社社员和一部分非社员的文盲。根据目前农村互助合作运动迅速发展和部分地区开展扫盲工作的经验看来，适当加快扫盲工作的进度是必要的。只要我们积极创造条件、采取有效措施，也是可能做到的。为了适当加快农村中的扫盲工作，今后应该进一步重视开展常年的学习。应该使所有参加扫盲和文化学习的人都能在常年学习中逐步巩固、不断提高。克服一曝十寒、“年年上冬学，年年从头学”的现象。农民文化学习的组织一定要和生产的组织结合起来，即和农业生产合作社、互助组的组织结合起来。要根据农业生产和季节的特点，采取有效的形式组织农民学习。可以提倡比较正规的常年的业余文化学校，也可以采取各种分散的小组以及包教包学个别教学的办法。我以为农民业余文化学校，今后可以成为农民业余学习的主要形式和中心。
    必须指出，扫除文盲工作是我国过渡时期文化革命的基本组成部分，它对于我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的胜利完成有极重大的意义；同时它又是一项巨大的群众工作，要完成这个任务，必须动员各种社会力量来进行。我们希望全体青年们，不认字的要积极地参加学习，首先扫除文盲，有文化的青年们，要争取做扫盲工作，在第一个五年计划期内，每个有文化的青年至少扫除一个文盲，我想是轻而易举的。让我们大家来共同地努力，首先扫除青年和壮年中的文盲。
    为了开展业余学习，政府今后要在过去业余教育的基础上在学校、厂矿、机关和企业中大力举办正规的从小学到大学的业余学校，使广大职工能够利用业余时间系统地学习文化和科学技术。我们还要用举办函授教育的办法来吸收厂矿干部、技术人员和熟练工人进行学习。所有这些业余学校的学习，要逐步做到有正规的制度，在学习时间、师资、教材、经费和领导方面给以充分的保证，特别是学习时间的保证。许多厂矿的经验已经证明，由于参加业余学习的人有实际的生产经验，只要是办得好，业余教育是可以收到良好效果的。但是有些人对业余学习的认识是不够的，他们总认为业余学不好，要学习就应进普通的中学和大学。这种想法是脱离实际的。进中学进大学当然是重要的学习道路，但过去几年的经验证明，在中国今天的条件下，优秀的工农干部和产业工人是很难大量长期离职学习的。以业余学习为主的方针来开展工农干部和工农群众的文化教育，是扩大了工农教育的范围，使培养工农干部的途径更加广阔了和更加有效，使真正优秀的工农干部和工农群众得到了更多的受教育的机会。这是完全切合我国社会主义建设的需要和实际情况的。
    我们一定要积极创造条件，克服一切困难，把业余教育事业开展起来。我希望这次出席大会的同志们，在这方面起带头作用，以身作则并推动广大工农干部和工农群众积极参加业余学习，学好本领，进一步迎接社会主义建设的高潮。
    三、为了鼓励劳动和学习，为了提高文化水平，青年们还必须积极参加群众性的业余文化艺术活动。据一九五四年底的统计，在工人群众的业余文化组织方面，全国共有职工俱乐部一万三千多个（比一九五○年增加了十六倍以上），广播站八千六百多个，图书室一万七千多个，业余剧团七千七百多个，此外还有音乐、美术、舞蹈、文艺等组织一万七千六百多组，参加人员近二十万人。据一九五四年十五个省的不完全统计，在农村中共有业余剧团约六万三千多个，俱乐部约三千六百多个。但是，群众业余文化艺术活动的开展，在数量上和质量上还远远落后于广大群众的需要，还必须继续大力开展。政府文化部门必须在这方面做很多的工作，各项文学艺术事业，必须贯彻面向工农兵的方针，剧团应多为工农兵演出，电影应多为工农兵放映，作家应多为工农兵写作。但是，应该指出，开展群众性的业余文化艺术活动，仅仅依靠一些文化工作部门和专业的文化工作者还是不够的，我们还必须依靠广大群众的积极性和创造性，鼓励和扶植群众的文艺创作活动，从工农兵中培养大量的群众文艺工作者。政府文化部门及一切文艺工作者和各种专业的文艺团体都必须把协助和指导开展群众业余文化艺术活动作为自己的一个重要任务。同时，还要加强和扩大通俗书报的出版和发行工作，源源不断地供给广大群众文化食粮。
    在开展群众的文化艺术活动和娱乐活动中，青年同志应该成为骨干。今天在座的都是来自各个岗位的青年社会主义建设的积极分子，有些已经是、或者将要是群众业余文化艺术活动中的积极分子，希望你们回去以后，将你们那里的业余文化艺术活动更好地开展起来。
    四、在学习文化和科学技术的同时，必须学习政治，即必须学习马克思、列宁主义。
    社会主义的建设者，只有懂得和掌握了马克思列宁主义关于社会发展规律的科学，才能真正理解社会主义事业的必然性和正义性，才能理解自己的工作和社会主义事业的关联性，才能自觉自愿地为实现新的社会制度而斗争。凡是忽视政治不学习马克思、列宁主义的人，必然会在工作中失去正确的方向。目前有一些人，他们只看到了建设社会主义迫切需要科学技术的一面，没有看到同时需要提高政治水平的一面，他们说：“有了技术就有了一切”、“政治是空道理，技术是真本钱。”这种脱离政治的思想，是十分有害的。我们必须在明确的政治方向指导下学习科学技术，使科学技术为社会主义的斗争任务服务。因此，学习马克思、列宁主义的理论，必须为每一个青年所重视。
    广大青年提高社会主义觉悟的另一个重要的途径，就是要积极参加当前的政治斗争。过去几年，广大青年在土地改革、抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”等重大的政治运动中受到了很大的锻炼，提高了觉悟。今后，青年们仍应积极参加实际的政治斗争，在复杂的尖锐的阶级斗争中，在建设祖国和保卫祖国建设的斗争中，锻炼自己。某些青年不关心政治斗争，不参加政治生活的倾向，必须克服。同时，青年们还必须注意培养自己的共产主义的道德品质，用集体主义来代替个人主义。如果没有共产主义的道德品质，一个青年决不可能成为社会主义建设的有用人材。共产主义道德的树立过程，就是不断地提高共产主义觉悟、清除资产阶级腐朽思想影响的过程。因此，要求青年们注意划清工人阶级与资产阶级的思想界限，明辨是非，用批评和自我批评的武器，不断地进行自我教育，逐步提高自己的觉悟水平。
    五、不论在学校学习，或者参加业余学习，也不论学习文化、科学、技术和政治，都必须有刻苦好学的精神。特别是目前的工农青年，由于原来的文化基础差，要能掌握现代的科学技术知识，决不是一年半载就可以成功的。这是一个长期的艰苦的紧张的战斗过程。不经过艰苦的战斗，科学技术这座堡垒是攻不下来的。因此必须要老老实实地学，刻苦地学，才可能达到目的。马克思曾说：“在科学上面是没有平坦的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”毛主席说：“科学是老老实实的学问，任何一点调皮都是不行的。”我们必须记取马克思和毛主席的这个重要的指示，拿出最大的毅力来坚持学习。
    这里，我们也要指出，在青年人中也还有一些人对待学习的态度不正确。有的人只是口头上谈论学习的重要性，而在实际行动中总是借口各种客观原因来掩盖自己学习上的懈怠。有的人虽也常常进行业余学习，但不能刻苦坚持，一遇到困难就半途而废。学习是没有捷径的，是没有取巧的“窍门”的，是没有止境的，我们应该在青年中形成一种为了社会主义事业而积极地刻苦地持久地和密切联系实际的学习风气。
    对于同志们的学习和工作，我现在还要提出三点希望：
    首先，我们要热爱劳动，要对学习文化和劳动的关系有个正确的认识。近几年来，有些知识青年，在初中或者高小毕业之后，只想升学，不愿参加工农业生产劳动，尤其不愿参加农业生产劳动。有的勉强参加了劳动，也不安心，总觉得知识青年不应当再从事生产劳动。这种想法是错误的。在剥削阶级看来，劳动是“下贱的”工作；但在我们劳动人民看来，劳动是最为光荣的事业。劳动是创造一切的源泉，我们学习的目的，就是为了胜利地进行社会主义建设，并不是学了文化就去抛弃劳动。当然，有可能多办一些学校，使更多的人入学和升学，早日普及小学和中学的义务教育，是好的。不过，这不是单凭主观愿望可以决定，而是决定于各种条件，主要是财力和师资的条件。国家现在用于教育的经费已经很大，学校发展的速度已经不慢。如果不顾生产发展的水平，孤立去发展教育，那就只有削减工农业投资才有可能，这就要推迟社会主义建设的速度，这是不可以的。
    其次，要热爱自己的工作，要安心于自己的工作岗位。建设社会主义事业，是一项极其伟大复杂的工程，它需要千百万人民彼此协调地辛勤工作。各个方面的工作都是需要的，都是社会主义建设所不可缺少的组成部分。只要安心工作，虚心学习，在任何岗位上是都可以作出成绩的。中国有一句古话，叫做“行行出状元”。每个青年的热情和智慧都可以在社会主义建设中获得无限发展。我们这次青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的召开，就集中反映了这个真理。但是，我们应该承认，在广大青年中间，也还有这样一部分人，他们虽然在各种工作岗位上劳动着，但他们还不了解自己所作的工作和整个社会主义事业的关系。他们不热爱自己的工作，认为“没有发展前途”，这山望着那山高，凡是有这些思想的青年，他们一定作不好工作，也搞不好学习的。每个青年必须全心全意为祖国而工作，为伟大的社会主义建设而工作，才会有自己的前途。任何个人主义的打算，都是错误的，必须加以克服。
    最后，我希望同志们要永远保持谦虚的美德。有些人在工作上有了成绩、有了创造，受到了表扬以后，产生了骄傲自满情绪，而骄傲自满是资产阶级个人主义的思想情绪，有了个人主义，就势必脱离了群众，很快就失去了积极分子的本色，这是必须警惕的。
    我们必须认识，骄傲自满是没有任何理由的。要了解，社会主义和共产主义事业，是党所领导的劳动人民的集体的事业。我们在社会主义事业中所从事的任何工作，只有依靠党，依靠群众，依靠各种社会条件，才可能顺利的完成。毛主席说：“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。对自己，‘学而不厌’，对人家，‘诲人不倦’”。我们必须按照毛主席的指示，虚心学习，刻苦努力，不断前进。（新华社）
