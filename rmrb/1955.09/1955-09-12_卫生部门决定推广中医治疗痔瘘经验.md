The health department recently assisted the Chongqing Hemorrhoid and Fistula Medical Team in Beijing to summarize their experience in treating internal hemorrhoids and anorectal fistulas with traditional Chinese medicine methods, and decided to promote it widely.

Thirteen hospitals in Beijing have sent surgeons to learn from this team. After learning, most of them returned to their original hospitals to promote this therapy, and cured many patients with internal hemorrhoids and anorectal fistulas.

Since the Chongqing Hemorrhoid and Fistula Medical Team came to Beijing last September, they have set up a hemorrhoid and fistula department in the Sixth Hospital directly under the Central Government, using the traditional Chinese medicine methods of escharotics and thread ligation to treat patients with internal hemorrhoids and anorectal fistulas. From October 15 last year to September 9 this year, among the 1,748 patients they treated, 923 have been cured. Zhang Weiting, who suffered from complex anorectal fistula for 29 years and had undergone six unsuccessful operations, was cured and discharged from the hospital two months after using thread ligation combined with surgery.

The medical team has also received nearly 700 letters from all over the country and countries such as the Soviet Union, many of which express their hope to learn from their experience in treating hemorrhoids and fistulas. (Xinhua News Agency)

    卫生部门决定推广中医治疗痔瘘经验
    卫生部门最近协助在北京的重庆痔瘘医疗小组总结出他们用中医方法治疗内痔和肛直肠瘘管的经验，并决定广泛推行。
    北京市有十三个医院已派了外科医师向这个小组学习，他们经过学习后，大都回到原来的医院推行了这种疗法，治好了很多患内痔和肛直肠瘘管的病人。
    重庆痔瘘医疗小组从去年九月来北京后，就在中央直属机关第六医院设立了痔瘘科，用中医的枯痔法和挂线法治疗患内痔和肛直肠瘘管的病人。从去年十月十五日到今年九月九日，在他们治疗的一千七百四十八个病人中，已有九百二十三人痊愈。患复杂性肛直肠瘘管已有二十九年的张巍庭，过去施行了六次手术都没收效，后来用挂线法配合手术治疗，两个月后就痊愈出院了。
    这个医疗小组目前还收到了近七百封全国各地和苏联等国家的来信，其中很多信表示希望学习他们治疗痔瘘的经验。　（新华社）
