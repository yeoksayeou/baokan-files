Self-Made Shallow-Draft Tugboat Sails on the Liao River

The Yingkou Shipyard began trial-manufacturing shallow-draft tugboats in July. The first "Liaoning Pioneer" shallow-draft tugboat was completed on August 31st and officially began sailing on the newly opened middle reaches of the Liao River waterway on September 5th.

This tugboat was designed with reference to the Soviet Union's new type of inland river tugboat, taking into account the shallow water conditions in the middle reaches of the Liao River. This tugboat has 120 horsepower and can tow over 400 tons of goods. The tugboat's draft is only 0.65 meters, making it suitable for sailing in shallow water. It is also resistant to wind and travels at high speed. A sailboat can only make three round trips from Xinmin County to Juliuhe in 30 days, while a shallow-draft tugboat can make ten trips.

    自造浅水拖轮在辽河上航行
    营口修船厂从七月间开始试造浅水拖轮。第一艘“辽宁先锋号”浅水拖轮在八月三十一日造成，九月五日已经正式航行在新开辟的辽河中游航线上。
    这艘拖轮是参照苏联新型内河拖轮，根据辽河中游水浅的实际情况设计的。这艘拖轮有一百二十马力，能拖四百多吨重的物品。这艘拖轮吃水仅零点六五公尺，适合在浅水航行，同时不怕风，速度快。帆船由新民县到巨流河，在三十天内只能往返三次，而浅水拖轮就能航行十次。
