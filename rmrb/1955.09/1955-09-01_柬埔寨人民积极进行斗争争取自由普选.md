Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st: The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" recently published a commentary on the Cambodian people's struggle for free and fair elections.

The commentary stated: The Cambodian people have been actively participating in the election campaign. Despite the threat of reprisals, they frequently hold gatherings ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of people. At the same time, the Cambodian people have written countless petitions to the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission in Cambodia, condemning the retaliatory actions of the Cambodian Royal Government and suggesting that the International Commission carry out monitoring work to ensure free and fair elections.

The commentary described the retaliatory actions taken by the Cambodian Royal Government against the people striving for free and fair elections. It said: More than thirty election candidates from the People's Party and the Democratic Party have been arrested and thrown into prison.

However, the Cambodian people are continuing their struggle. On August 3, 1955, the three accused editors-in-chief of "Nhan Dan", "Solidarity" and "Forward" newspapers resolutely fought to uphold justice during the opening of their trial at the Phnom Penh Criminal Court. Many young people and students came to the court to express their warm sympathy for these heroic defenders of justice.

The commentary said that the People's Party and the Democratic Party are the main forces of the Cambodian people in their struggle for peace and national independence. The People's Party has been working to unite people from all walks of life in Cambodia to fight for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and to oppose the US plot to turn Cambodia into a military base and drag the country into military blocs.

The commentary continued: Although the Democratic Party did not participate in the past resistance war, it actively participated in the struggle for free and fair elections and against the US-Cambodia military "aid" agreement. It demanded the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, opposed US interference in Cambodia's internal affairs, and supported the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The commentary said that both the People's Party and the Democratic Party have gained the support of the Cambodian people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st: The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on August 30th entitled "Another Conspiracy to Sabotage Cambodian Elections".

The commentary said that the United States recently publicized that "Viet Minh" forces had attacked Stung Treng province in Cambodia, near the Lao border. The Cambodian Royal Government's newspapers immediately echoed this argument, saying that "these actions will create chaos and prevent the Cambodian elections from taking place."

The commentary pointed out that these messages are not only a despicable fabrication, but also a conspiracy to sabotage the Cambodian elections.

The commentary mentioned that the Cambodian Royal Government recently declared Cambodia to be "unsafe and disordered." In order to "maintain security and order," the Royal Government established a Ministry of Public Security. The editorial pointed out that the actual purpose of establishing the Ministry of Public Security is to threaten democratic forces during the election period. This is exactly the same as their blatant rumor-mongering that "Viet Minh is attacking Stung Treng." This is their attempt to prepare public opinion for intensifying terrorist activities.

    柬埔寨人民积极进行斗争争取自由普选
    新华社河内三十一日讯　越南“人民报”最近发表评论，评柬埔寨人民为自由普选而进行的斗争。
    评论说：柬埔寨人民一直在积极地参加选举运动。尽管有受到报复的威胁，他们还是经常举行从几百人到成千上万人的集会。同时，柬埔寨人民已经写给柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会无数的请愿书，谴责柬埔寨王国政府进行的报复活动，并且建议国际委员会执行监察工作来保证自由普选。
    评论叙述了柬埔寨王国政府对争取自由普选的人民进行的报复行动。它说：三十多名人民派和民主党的竞选候选人已被逮捕，并且被投入监狱。
    但是，柬埔寨人民正在继续他们的斗争。一九五五年八月三日，“人民报”、“团结报”和“前进报”的三个被控告的主编在金边的刑事法庭开庭时坚决地为维护正义而进行了斗争。许多青年和学生到法庭来表示他们对这些英勇的正义维护者的热烈同情。
    评论说，人民派和民主党是柬埔寨人民在他们争取和平和民族独立的斗争中的主要的力量。人民派一直在努力团结柬埔寨各阶层人民，来为争取日内瓦协定的彻底履行而进行斗争，来反对美国把柬埔寨变成一个军事基地和把这个国家拖入军事集团的阴谋。
    评论接着说：虽然民主党没有参加过去的抗战，但是它积极地参加了争取举行自由普选和反对美国—柬埔寨军事“援助”协定的斗争。它要求彻底履行日内瓦协定，反对美国干涉柬埔寨内政和赞成和平共处的五项原则。
    评论说，人民派和民主党都得到了柬埔寨人民的支持。
    据新华社河内三十一日电　越南“人民报”八月三十日以“又一个破坏柬埔寨普选的阴谋”为题发表评论。
    评论说，最近美国宣传说：“越盟”部队进攻接近老挝边界的柬埔寨上丁省。柬埔寨王国政府的报纸也立即响应这种论调，说什么“这些行为将会造成混乱，使柬埔寨的普选不能进行”。
    评论指出，上述这些消息不仅是一个卑鄙的捏造，而且还是一个破坏柬埔寨普选的阴谋。
    评论提到，最近柬埔寨王国政府曾宣布柬埔寨全国“不安全和无秩序”。为了“维持安全和秩序”，王国政府成立了公安警察部。社论指出，成立公安警察部的实际目的是为了在普选期中威胁民主力量。这和他们明目张胆地造谣说“越盟进攻上丁”的论调，是如出一辙的。这是他们想为加强恐怖活动准备舆论条件。
