Dear comrades and friends:

Ten years ago, on this very day and in this very place, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was declared.

After years of severe trials, our people are once again enthusiastically celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Today is a glorious day for the Vietnamese people, and a day of common joy for oppressed nations and peace-loving people around the world.

Compared with historical time, ten years is not a long period. However, looking back at the past decade, there have been many tremendous changes and advancements both internationally and domestically:

The great Soviet Union has not only healed the wounds of war long ago, but is also victoriously carrying out communist construction.

The 600 million Chinese people have successfully carried out their revolution and are building socialism.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has victoriously repelled the attacks of sixteen invading nations.

The other people's democratic countries are also rapidly advancing on the road of socialist construction.

Countries such as India, Indonesia, and Burma have shaken off the shackles of colonialism and become independent, free nations.

National liberation movements are surging everywhere. Many countries have endorsed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In short, over the past decade, the forces of world peace and democracy have rapidly developed and gained the upper hand. Imperialism has clearly been weakened. Recently, the Geneva Four-Power Conference has eased international tensions, which is also a new victory for the forces of peace.

During the past decade, simultaneously with the changes internationally, many tremendous changes have also taken place in our country:

Our people's just resistance war has achieved victory.

Last year's Geneva Conference brought peace to Indochina based on the recognition by various countries of the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam and its two neighboring countries, Cambodia and Laos.

The North of our country has been completely liberated.

Our country has become an intimately connected part of the socialist and people's democratic family, which includes 900 million brothers. This is a great victory for our people.

Along with these great victories, at present, we still have many difficulties that must be overcome:

Peace has not yet been consolidated. Our country is temporarily divided into two parts

In the South, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, at the instigation and with the support of US imperialism, is stepping up the strengthening of its army, creating internal strife in the South, persecuting the people, stifling democratic freedoms, trying to evade consultation with our government, attempting to evade free general elections throughout the country, and undermining the unification of the motherland. In short, US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime are doing everything possible to sabotage the Geneva Accords.

However, no matter how malicious the conspiracies of US imperialism and its running dogs, Vietnam will surely achieve unification, because our country is a whole, which cannot be divided by anyone. Free general elections must be realized, because it is the deep desire of all our people from North to South, and also the common desire of peace-loving people around the world.

Our people and government resolutely and thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords.

We demand that the Southern authorities correctly implement the agreement. France, as a signatory to the agreement, should respect its signature and fulfill its responsibilities towards the Geneva Accords.

We hope that peace-loving countries, especially those participating in the Geneva Conference and those with supervisory and monitoring responsibilities, will work hard to contribute to the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords.

At present, the task of our people and government is to continue to fight for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, that is, to fight for the consolidation of peace and the realization of unification.

We must strive to expand and consolidate the National United Front.

We must strive to consolidate all aspects of the North:

Successfully complete land reform.

Restore the economy, with particular emphasis on agriculture.

Consolidate national defense and consolidate security and order.

Resolutely and gradually improve the living standards of the people, first and foremost workers, the military, and civil servants, while gradually reducing the burden on farmers.

In order to complete the above tasks, every individual and every department must actively launch patriotic emulation campaigns, increase production, practice thrift, respect and protect public property, and eliminate corruption and waste.

Can we accomplish all these things? We must accomplish them, and we will definitely be able to accomplish them. Because our compatriots love the country and are very brave and hardworking. Because the policies of our Party and government are correct and in line with the wishes of the people. Because our cadres are loyal. Because our brotherly countries, especially the Soviet Union and China, are generously and selflessly assisting us, giving us further conditions for self-reliance.

Here, on behalf of our government and people, I once again thank the brotherly countries.

Consolidating the North is also effectively assisting the struggle of our Southern compatriots for peace and unification.

The people of the South made important contributions to the August Revolution and waged a long and heroic nine-year resistance war. At present, although living in terror and chaos, their will to fight is consistently strong, they are consistently loyal to the motherland, and consistently actively struggle.

The government, the Party, and I constantly think of them. Here, on behalf of the Party and the government, I extend my warm greetings and encouragement to the Southern compatriots who are heroically fighting for peace and unification.

In the past decade, we have overcome all difficulties and achieved many victories. This is due to the unity of our people, the boundless heroism of our troops, and the correct and resolute leadership of our Party and government. Because internally we have a strong national united front, and externally we have the support of the peace-loving people of the world.

In the future, we must further consolidate and develop this force.

In terms of the national united front, we must further expand and consolidate it. From North to South, whoever is in favor of peace, unification, independence, and democracy, we are ready to unite with them and sincerely cooperate with them, regardless of which side they previously followed.

Unity is an invincible force.

The force of unity helped the August Revolution succeed.

The force of unity helped the resistance war achieve victory.

The force of unity will mobilize the people from North to South to struggle for the realization of national peace, unification, independence, and democracy.

At present, we still have many difficulties. We must not subjectively underestimate these difficulties. But we are not afraid of difficulties, and we are determined to overcome all difficulties, and we will definitely be able to overcome them.

Under the force of the united people of the whole country, with strong confidence in the bright future of the motherland, and with the spirit of victory of a heroic nation, we bravely advance. In the heroic resistance war of the past eight or nine years, we have achieved victory, and in the current political struggle, we will surely achieve victory.

Long live the great unity of the Vietnamese people!

Long live the great unity of the peace-loving people of the world!

Long live Vietnam, peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous!

Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!

### 胡志明主席告越南人民的号召书

专栏：

    胡志明主席告越南人民的号召书全国同胞和海外侨胞们：全体战士和干部们：父老、青年和儿童们：亲爱的同志和朋友们：
    十年前，也是在今天和这个地方，越南民主共和国宣布成立。
    经过几年来的严重考验后，我们人民又热烈地来庆祝越南民主共和国成立十周年。
    今天，是我们越南人民光荣的一天，同时，也是被压迫民族和世界爱好和平人民所共同欢欣的一天。
    与历史时间相比较，十年来并不算太长。但是，回顾过去的十年，在国际和国内却有着许多巨大的变化和进步：
    伟大的苏联，不仅很早就医治了战争的创伤，而且还正在胜利地进行共产主义建设。
    六亿的中国人民已经成功地进行了革命，并且正在建设社会主义。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国胜利地击退了十六个侵略国家的进攻。
    其他的人民民主国家也都在建设社会主义的道路上迅速地前进。
    印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸等国，已经摆脱了殖民地的桎梏，成为独立、自由的国家。
    民族解放运动在各地澎湃高涨。许多国家都赞同和平共处的五项原则。总之，在过去的十年当中，世界和平和民主力量是迅速地发展并且占了优势。帝国主义很显然地受到了削弱。最近，日内瓦四国会议又缓和了国际紧张局势，这也是和平力量的一次新的胜利。
    在过去的十年当中，与国际上变化的同时，在我国也有着许多巨大的变化：
    我们人民的正义抗战，已经取得了胜利。
    去年的日内瓦会议，已经在各国承认越南和柬埔寨、老挝两个邻国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上，带来了印度支那的和平。
    我国的北方已经完全解放。
    我国成为包括有九亿兄弟的社会主义和人民民主大家庭中密切相连的一部分。这是我们人民的伟大胜利。
    和这些伟大胜利的同时，目前，我们还有许多的困难必须克服：
    和平尚未巩固。我国暂时被分为两部。
    在南方，吴庭艳政权在美帝国主义嗾使和支持下，加紧增强军队，在南部制造了煮豆燃豆箕的冲突，迫害人民、窒息自由民主权利，设法逃避和我们政府的协商，企图逃避在全国进行自由普选和破坏祖国的统一。总之，美帝国主义和吴庭艳政权正在千方百计破坏日内瓦协定。
    但是，不管美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋如何恶毒，越南将一定实现统一，因为我国是一个整体，是任何人所不能分割的。自由普选将必须得到实现，因为它是我们从北到南全体人民的深切愿望，同时也是世界爱好和平人民的共同愿望。
    我们人民和政府坚决彻底执行日内瓦协定。
    我们要求南方当局要正确执行协定。法国是协定的签字者，应该尊重自己的签字和完成自己对日内瓦协定的责任。
    我们希望爱好和平的各国，尤其是参加日内瓦会议的各国和有监督和监察任务的各国努力为日内瓦协定的正确执行作出贡献。
    目前，我们人民和政府的任务是：继续为日内瓦协定的彻底执行而斗争，即为巩固和平、实现统一而斗争。
    我们要努力扩大和巩固民族统一战线。
    我们要努力巩固北方的各方面：
    良好地完成土地改革。
    恢复经济，特别注重农业。
    巩固国防、巩固安全秩序。
    坚决逐步提高人民的生活水平，首先是工人、部队和公务人员，同时逐步减轻农民的负担。
    为了完成以上工作，每个人和每个部门都要积极展开爱国竞赛，增加生产，厉行节约，尊重和保护公共财产，肃清贪污和浪费。
    我们能否全部完成这些事情呢？我们必须完成，而且我们一定能够完成。因为我们的同胞热爱国家，并且是非常勇敢和勤劳的。因为我们党和政府的政策是正确的，是符合于人民的愿望的。因为我们的干部是忠诚的。因为我们的兄弟各国，首先是苏联和中国是慷慨无私的援助我们的，使我们有进一步的自力更生的条件。
    在这里，我代表我们政府和人民，再一次地感谢各兄弟国家。
    巩固北方也就是切实地援助南方同胞要求和平和统一的斗争。
    南方人民曾为八月革命作出了重要的贡献，曾进行了九年的长期英勇的抗战。目前，虽然正生活在恐怖混乱之中，但是他们的斗争意志是一贯地坚强，他们一贯地忠诚于祖国，一贯积极地斗争。
    政府、党和我不断地想念到他们。在这里，我代表党和政府向正在为和平和统一而英勇奋斗的南方同胞致以亲切的问候和勉励。
    在过去的十年当中，我们已经克服了一切困难并且取得了许多胜利。这是由于我们人民的团结一致，我们部队的无限英勇，我们党和政府的正确和坚决的领导。由于在内部我们有强大的民族统一战线，在外部我们又得到世界爱好和平人民的支持。
    今后，我们更要巩固和发展这个力量。
    在民族统一战线方面，我们要更加扩大和巩固。从北到南，谁赞成和平、统一、独立和民主，我们就准备与他们团结，与他们真诚的合作，无论他们以前是追随那一方面的。
    团结是无敌的力量。
    团结的力量已经帮助了八月革命获得成功。
    团结的力量已经帮助了抗战取得胜利。
    团结的力量将动员从北到南的人民为实现全国和平、统一、独立和民主而进行斗争。
    目前，我们的困难仍然很多。我们不要主观地轻视这些困难。但是我们也不害怕困难，我们有决心克服一切困难，我们一定克服得了。
    我们在全国人民团结一致的力量下，在对祖国光辉未来的坚强信心下，在一个英雄民族的必胜精神下勇敢地前进。在过去八、九年的英勇抗战中，我们已经取得了胜利，在现在的政治斗争中，我们也将一定取得胜利。
    越南人民大团结万岁！
    世界爱好和平人民大团结万岁！
    越南和平、统一、独立、民主和富强万岁！
    越南民主共和国万岁！
