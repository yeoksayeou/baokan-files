    Lhasa-Rikaze Highway Nears Completion of Final Section
    The advance construction personnel for the final section of the Lhasa-Rikaze highway construction project have arrived at the construction site, which is a little over ten kilometers away from Rikaze City. Starting in late August, some road construction workers and soldiers have successively crossed the Yarlung Tsangpo River and are building the road from the riverbank towards Rikaze. Workers building the Nyang Chu River Bridge and the Yarlung Tsangpo River ferry are already on their way to the construction site, and the timber for shipbuilding is being shipped from Lhasa. At the same time, the roadbed project on the north bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, stretching over twenty kilometers, and the bridge construction project over the Uyu Moqu River are being accelerated, striving to open to traffic to the riverbank by mid-September. This final section of the project is 82 kilometers long and is expected to be completed within October.
    Before the road construction personnel crossed the river, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee and the Rikaze Zongben of the Tibet Local Government notified all Zong and Xi'ka along the highway south of the river to support the road construction. Local farmers and herdsmen organized thousands of yaks and donkeys to transport supplies for the road construction personnel, and prepared more than 100,000 jin of fuel for them. The Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee also sent people to prepare timber for the construction of the Nyang Chu River Bridge and organized more than 20 yak-hide boats to ferry personnel and supplies at the Yarlung Tsangpo River crossing. Some Tibetans even brought green peas, radishes and other vegetables, and highland barley wine to express their appreciation to the road construction workers and soldiers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    拉萨日喀则公路修最后一段
    修筑拉萨到日喀则公路的最后一段工程的先头施工人员，已进抵距日喀则市十多公里的工地。从八月下旬起，部分筑路工人和战士陆续渡过雅鲁藏布江，从江边向日喀则修筑。修建年楚河大桥和造雅鲁藏布江渡船的工人，已出发前往工地，造船的木料正从拉萨启运。同时，雅鲁藏布江北岸的二十多公里路基工程和乌于墨曲河上架桥的工程，正加紧进行，争取在九月中旬通车江边。这最后一段工程共长八十二公里，预计在十月内完工。
    在筑路人员过江以前，班禅堪布会议厅委员会和西藏地方政府日喀则宗本，就通知江南岸沿公路线各宗和谿卡支援筑路。各地农牧民组织了上千头牦牛、驴子为筑路人员运送物资，并为筑路人员准备了十多万斤燃料。班禅堪布会议厅委员会还派人为修建年楚河大桥准备木料，组织了二十多只牛皮船在雅鲁藏布江渡口上摆渡人员和物资。有些藏民还带着青豌豆、萝卜等蔬菜和青稞酒慰问筑路的工人和战士。　（新华社）
