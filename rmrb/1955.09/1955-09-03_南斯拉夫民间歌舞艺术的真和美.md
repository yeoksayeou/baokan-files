    The performances of the Yugoslav “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble in our capital city in recent days have aroused tremendous repercussions and won unanimous praise from the audience. The performances fully demonstrated the richness and beauty of Yugoslav folk song and dance art, and the outstanding talent of the artists of the “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble in performing folk songs and dances. Through the performance of rich programs, they conveyed the real life and real thoughts and feelings of the Yugoslav people to the Chinese audience, deepened our understanding of the Yugoslav people, and aroused our excitement and pleasure. The audience thanked the ensemble for each performance with thunderous applause and bouquets of flowers. Such a warm and friendly performance will not easily disappear from our memory.

    The characteristic of Yugoslav folk song and dance lies not only in the richness of content and the diversity of forms, but also in the natural, simple, and concise style. Each program is a pure lyrical poem. Here, the local color is so distinct, the atmosphere of people's lives is so strong, the heroic, lively, optimistic, and humorous character of the people is so prominent, the people's love for the motherland and for life is so strong, and the styles and colors of folk costumes are so diverse and so simple! We seem not to be watching a performance in a Chinese theater, but watching dance, listening to performances and singing in the Yugoslav folk scene—we heard the pulse of Yugoslav folk life and saw the truth and beauty of Yugoslav folk art!

    The effect of the performance proves the success of the “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble and explains the reason why this ensemble has gained extraordinary reputation in many countries.

    The secret of the success of the “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble, under the leadership of the talented artist O. Skovran, lies in their respect and love for folk art, and their willingness to engage in honest labor and meticulous work in the excavation, arrangement, research, and refinement of folk songs and dances, closely grasping the characteristics of truth and beauty of folk songs and dances, and carefully and creatively processing and processing them. Then, through their own dance movements and musical accompaniment that is completely adapted to it, the truth and beauty is concentratedly reproduced on the stage. This is a very arduous artistic creation, which requires not only a deep understanding and high love for folk songs and dances, but also tireless creative labor and frequent artistic training. The performance results of the “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble fully illustrate this point.

    The artists of the “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble so skillfully control the movements of the dance, so naturally use the strict dance language to express inner activities and emotional ups and downs, giving the audience a feeling of unrestricted freedom of movement, this is true art.

    The audience congratulated the successful performance of the Macedonian "Gemit Dance" with stormy applause. This dance is a depiction of the struggle of the Gemit guerrillas, Macedonian avengers, against the Turkish conquerors a hundred years ago. It is a moving poem praising the liberation struggle of the oppressed nation. The high unity of the content and form of this dance achieved a powerful artistic effect, giving the audience an imposing sense of solemnity and magnificence. Through reconnaissance and offensive dance movements, we not only saw the intensity and arduousness of the struggle, but also saw the people's guerrillas' mountain-like heroism, indestructible fighting will, and unshakable confidence in victory. The reason why our audience felt particularly cordial and excited about this dance is not only due to its artistic success, but also due to our warm resonance with the Yugoslav people who bravely resisted aggression.

    The "Montenegrin Dance" uses extremely magnificent dance postures to express the people's passionate yearning for a free life. A young couple imitates the flight of eagles, and under the accompaniment of joyous singing and dancing by other people, they constitute a magnificent artistic realm, deeply touching the hearts of the audience. "Sada Dance" is a passionate lyric poem. The young girl shows her lover her ability to handle all household chores. What a poetic picture of life! The rapid dance steps and skilled and diverse movements show the infinite joy of youth, and the infinite creative wisdom and work enthusiasm. In the "Vlash National Competition Dance" and the "Banat Suburban Competition Dance", young men and women compete in various postures, showing a fiery enthusiasm for labor. Many dances are accompanied by touching folk songs, strengthening the infectious power of the dance, and the solo singing of Croatian folk songs aroused strong excitement among the audience.

    Throughout the performance, the orchestra conducted by Milanovic Željko and the string orchestra conducted by Putnik Brivoje played a significant role. Under the accompaniment of rhythmic music, the theme of the dance was more prominent and the effect of the dance was strengthened. The melody of the music and the movements of the dance were so harmonious, forming a seamless whole, thereby producing an imposing force.

    The "Classical Bosnian Mute Dance" without musical instrument accompaniment has a unique style and gives people a fresh feeling. The lads shake the girls' hands desperately to test whether their fiancées are healthy and hardworking. This is an excellent reflection of the local people's life style. Although there is no musical instrument accompaniment, the audience can still feel the musicality of the dance. The beautiful sounds emanating from the actors' footsteps and costumes so naturally match the rhythm of the dance, making this poetic dance picture radiate a high fragrance of truth and beauty.

    The costumes of the male and female actors aroused our strong interest and gave us a sense of truth and beauty. The richness of the clothing styles and the bright yet simple colors of the clothing prominently express the Yugoslav folk style. This is an important factor in constituting the truth and beauty of the entire dance.

    The characteristic of the performance of the Yugoslav “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble lies in that it does not pursue any false external effects, but always grasps the inherent truth and beauty of folk songs and dances, emphasizes the expression, and uses this to infect the audience. This is worthy of learning by our country's dancers and musicians.

    Any country or nation that wants to develop its own art must respect and develop the excellent traditions of folk art. On the issue of how to organize and refine folk song and dance art, the “Kolo” Folk Dance Ensemble has created rich experience in the process of hard work. While thanking the ensemble for the performance, we should learn from the artists of the ensemble and use their experience to enrich our own experience.

    南斯拉夫民间歌舞艺术的真和美
    林淡秋
    南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团几天来在我国首都的演出，引起了巨大的反响，博得了观众异口同声的赞扬。演出充分显示了南斯拉夫民间歌舞艺术的丰富和优美，显示了“科罗”民间歌舞团的艺术家们表演民间歌舞的卓越才能。他们通过丰富节目的演出，把南斯拉夫人民的真实生活和真实的思想感情传达给中国的观众，加深了我们对南斯拉夫人民的理解，唤起了我们的激动和愉快。观众都用满堂掌声和满台鲜花答谢歌舞团的每场演出，这样充满了热情和友谊的亲切的演出会，是不容易从我们的记忆中消失的。
    南斯拉夫民间歌舞的特色，不仅在于内容的丰富和形式的多样，而且在于风格的自然、朴素和简洁。每个节目都是一首纯朴的抒情诗。在这里，地方色彩是那样鲜明，人民的生活气息是那样浓厚，人民的豪迈、活泼、乐观和幽默的性格是那样突出，人民对祖国、对生活的爱是那样强烈，民间服装的式样和色彩是那样多样，又那样朴素！我们彷佛不是在中国戏院里看演出，而是在南斯拉夫的民间看舞蹈，听演奏和歌唱——我们听到了南斯拉夫民间生活的脉搏，看到了南斯拉夫民间艺术的真和美！
    演出效果证明了“科罗”民间歌舞团的成功，说明了这个歌舞团所以能在许多国家取得不平凡声誉的原因。
    在天才艺术家奥·斯科夫兰领导下的“科罗”民间歌舞团的成功的秘密，就在于他们对民间艺术的尊重和热爱，而且乐于在民间歌舞的发掘、整理、研究和提炼等方面进行诚实的劳动和细致的工作，紧紧掌握住民间歌舞的真和美的特点，加以慎重而又带创造性的处理和加工，再通过自己的舞蹈动作和完全与之适应的音乐伴奏，在舞台上集中地把它的真和美再现出来。这是十分艰苦的艺术创造，不但需要对民间歌舞的深刻理解和高度的爱，而且需要不倦的创作劳动和经常的艺术锻炼。“科罗”民间歌舞团的演出成绩充分说明了这一点。
    “科罗”民间歌舞团的艺术家们那样熟练地驾驭着舞蹈的动作，那样自然地用谨严的舞蹈语言来表达内心活动和情绪起伏，给观众以自由活动似的毫无拘束的感觉，这是真正的艺术。
    观众用暴风雨般的掌声祝贺马其顿的“格米特舞”的演出的成功。这个舞蹈是一百年前马其顿复仇者格米特人游击队反抗土耳其征服者的斗争片断的写照，是歌颂被压迫民族解放斗争的动人的诗篇。这个舞蹈的内容和形式的高度统一，取得了强大的艺术效果，给予观众以逼人的庄严感和壮美感。通过侦察和进攻等舞蹈动作，我们不但看到了斗争的激烈和艰苦，而且看到了人民游击队的巍如山岳的英雄气概、不可摧毁的战斗意志和不可动摇的胜利信心。我国观众所以对这个舞蹈特别感到亲切和激动，不仅由于它在艺术上的成功，而且由于我们对勇于反侵略的南斯拉夫人民的热烈的共鸣。
    “门的内哥罗舞”用十分壮美的舞蹈姿态表现了人民对自由生活的热情的向往。一对青年男女模仿雄鹰的飞翔，在其他人们用欢乐的歌唱伴舞之下，构成了一个壮丽的艺术境界，深深地打动了观众的心。“莎达舞”是一首热情横溢的抒情诗。年青的姑娘向情人显示自己能操一切家务的本领，这是多么富有诗意的生活画面！急速的舞步和熟练多样的动作，显示了无穷的青春的欢乐，显示了无限的创造智慧和工作热情。在“弗拉希民族竞赛舞”和“巴拿特近郊竞赛舞”中，青年男女以各种姿态进行竞赛，表现出如火如荼的劳动热情。许多舞蹈都伴随着动人的民歌，加强了舞蹈的感染力量，而克罗地亚民歌的独唱，引起了观众强烈的激动。
    在整个演出中，由米兰诺维奇·热尔格指挥的乐队和由普特尼克·布里沃埃指挥的弦乐队发挥了重大的作用。在节奏分明的音乐伴奏之下，舞蹈的主题更突出了，舞蹈的效果加强了。音乐的旋律和舞蹈的动作是那样合拍，形成浑然的整体，从而产生了逼人的力量。
    没有乐器伴奏的“古典波斯尼亚哑舞”，具有独特的风格，给人以新鲜的感觉。小伙子们拚命摇动姑娘们的手，以测验自己的未婚妻是否健康和刻苦耐劳。这是当地人民生活风貌的出色反映。虽无乐器伴奏，观众仍可感觉到舞蹈的音乐性。从演员的脚步和服饰发出来的美妙的音响，那么自然地合着舞蹈的节奏，使这富有诗意的舞蹈画面发散出高度的真和美的芳香。
    男女演员的服装引起了我们浓厚的兴味，同样给我们以真和美的感觉。服装式样的丰富和服装颜色的鲜明而又朴素，突出地表现了南斯拉夫的民间情调。这是构成全部舞蹈的真和美的重要因素。
    南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团的演出的特色，在于不追求任何虚伪的外部效果，总是抓住民间歌舞固有的真和美，加以突出的表现，用这来感染观众。这是值得我国舞蹈家和音乐家们学习的。
    任何国家任何民族要发展自己的艺术，都必须尊重和发展民间艺术的优秀传统，而在如何整理和提炼民间歌舞艺术的问题上，“科罗”民间歌舞团在辛勤劳作的过程中创造了丰富的经验。在感谢歌舞团的演出的同时，我们应该向歌舞团的艺术家们学习，用他们的经验来丰富我们自己的经验。
