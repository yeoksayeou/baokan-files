Xinhua News Agency, London, September 3rd: According to British Information Services London on the 2nd, the Chinese films "Chicken Feather Letter" and "The Butterfly Lovers," screened this week at the Edinburgh International Film Festival—and also screened for the first time in Britain—were welcomed by the Scottish newspapers. The "Glasgow Herald" published an article by a film critic saying, "Although you cannot expect many major events at the film festival, Edinburgh had a major event when the Chinese screened 'Chicken Feather Letter'. The story is very vivid and interesting, sometimes extremely exciting, and the story is told so clearly and coherently that we can appreciate it without any translation help."
    The critic of the "Scotsman" said: "The Butterfly Lovers" may seem a bit slow in movement and too long to Westerners, but the costumes and colors are beautiful, and the film has its thoughtful and moving aspects.

    在爱丁堡国际电影节上
    我国影片“鸡毛信”等受欢迎
    新华社三日讯　据英国新闻处伦敦二日消息：本星期在爱丁堡国际电影节上放映的——也是在英国第一次放映的——中国影片“鸡毛信”和“梁山伯与祝英台”受到苏格兰报纸的欢迎。“格拉斯哥先锋报”发表影评家的文章说：“虽然你在电影节中不能够指望有许多重大事件，但是当中国人放映‘鸡毛信’时爱丁堡就有一个重大事件，故事非常生动有趣，有时令人极度兴奋，故事叙说得如此清楚和有条有理，因此我们没有翻译帮助也能够毫无困难地欢赏它。”
    “苏格兰人报”的批评家说：“梁山伯与祝英台”在西方人看来听来动作有点迟缓，时间太长，但是服装和色彩很优美，这部电影有它的令人深思的感人的地方。
