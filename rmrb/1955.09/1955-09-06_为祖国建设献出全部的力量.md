    Dedicate All Strength to National Construction
    Yang Kui, Shovel Machine Driver and Labor Model of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant
    Just as our Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant was about to start construction, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to all workers nationwide to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. This made us even more aware of the glory and greatness of participating in national key construction, as well as the responsibilities that our working class should shoulder.
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is one of the key projects in our country's First Five-Year Plan. After its completion, it will be able to produce many high-performance, widely used machine tools, which is unprecedented in the history of machine manufacturing in our country. The people of the whole country call heavy industry construction the "lifeline," which is the guarantee of people's happy life. Because only by developing heavy industry first can we transform a poor and weak China into a prosperous and strong China, have a solid national defense, transform the transportation industry, and equip agriculture with machinery. The policy of the First Five-Year Plan to first develop heavy industry is entirely correct. Now that we are throwing ourselves into the great cause of socialist industrialization of the motherland, we feel honored and also feel a great responsibility.
    I used to be a soldier. During the Liberation War and the years of resisting American imperialism in Korea, we thought about building our motherland into an independent, prosperous, and strong country. I remember on the Korean battlefield, when we saw groups of silver swallows flying high in the sky, beating the American bandits into a miserable defeat, we deeply felt the importance of industrial construction. Without it, there would be no solid national defense. When we received news of the motherland's construction on the snowy Korean battlefield, we felt a warmth all over our bodies. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we defeated Chiang Kai-shek and defeated the American imperialist aggressors. We were victorious. Our desire to participate in peaceful construction labor was realized. I feel happy to be able to participate in the construction of the motherland.
    We workers all have this feeling: to contribute more hard work to the construction of the motherland, not to be idle for a minute. The happy life of socialism is achieved by the creative labor of millions of people. Last winter, when I was in Beijing, the leading comrades made a report to mobilize us to come to Wuhan to participate in key project construction, repeatedly pointing out that we should strive to overcome difficulties, but we are not afraid of difficulties and can overcome them. At the word "departure," our energy came. At the time of departure, our workers all made guarantees, saying: we are not afraid of wind and rain, we will overcome all difficulties, and strive to complete the task ahead of schedule.
    After arriving at the construction site, it proved that none of our companions made empty promises. Among our companions, who ever complained about difficulties? You couldn't hear a word. In the beginning, we had several bulldozers doing sod removal work. According to regulations, we were supposed to start the motors at seven o'clock in the morning, but when the work bell rang at seven o'clock every morning, the people in the dormitory were gone. At this time, the machines on the construction site were already roaring; and after the quitting time bell rang in the afternoon, people were reluctant to leave, as if they were fascinated by something. Workers proposed: to work one more hour, not to be late for one minute. The actual working hours each day always increased by more than an hour.
    Now, the earth leveling work on the construction site has begun, which is the first step in the entire project. There are still many difficult things to do to complete this huge construction project, and this is just the beginning. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions called on us: to strive to improve our cultural and technical level, to carry out labor competitions, to improve labor productivity, to practice strict economy, and to ensure the "fast, good, economical, and safe" progress of the project, which is entirely correct. We express our firm response. We are personally involved in an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done. The people of the whole country expect us to do a good job in industrial construction, and we will never fail the expectations of the people of the whole country. For the prosperity of the motherland, we, the working class, are determined to contribute all our wisdom and energy.

    为祖国建设献出全部的力量
    武汉重型工具机厂铲土机驾驶员、劳动模范  杨魁
    正当我们武汉重型工具机厂开工前夕，全国总工会发出了为保证完成和超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划告全国职工书，这使我们更加体会到参加国家重点建设的光荣和伟大，以及我们工人阶级应该尽的责任。
    武汉重型工具机厂是我国五年建设计划的重点工程之一，它建成后可生产出许多性能优良、用途广泛的机床，这是我国机器制造史上从来没有过的事。全国人民把重工业建设称为“命根子”，是人民幸福生活的保证。因为只有首先发展重工业，才能把贫弱的中国变成富强的中国，才能有巩固的国防，才能改造交通运输业，用机械装备农业。发展国民经济的第一个五年计划首先发展重工业的方针是完全正确的。现在我们正投身在祖国社会主义工业化的伟大事业，我们感到光荣，也觉得责任重大。
    我原来是一个战士，在解放战争时期，在朝鲜抗击美帝国主义的年月里，我们就想着把我们祖国建设成独立、富强的国家。记得在朝鲜战场上，当我们看祖国的成群的银燕飞翔在高空，把美国强盗打得狼狈大败的时候，我们就深深感到工业建设的重要，没有了它，就没有巩固的国防；当在风雪中的朝鲜战场上收到祖国建设消息的时候，我们就觉着身上一阵温暖。在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们打败了蒋介石，击败了美帝国主义侵略者，我们胜利了。我们参加和平建设的劳动的愿望实现了。我为能参加祖国的建设而感到幸福。
    我们工人都有这样的感觉：多为祖国建设辛勤地出一把力，不要闲着过一分钟，社会主义的幸福生活是靠千百万人的创造性劳动去实现。去年冬天我在北京的时候，领导同志就为动员我们来武汉参加重点工程建设作了报告，再三指出要努力克服困难，但我们是不怕困难而且也能够克服困难的。说声出发，劲儿都来了。出发的时候，我们工人都提出保证说：不怕风吹雨打，克服一切困难，争取提前完成任务。
    到工地以后，证明了我们同伴都没有空提保证。我们同伴中间是有谁叫过困难呢？你怎么也听不到一句。开头我们有几台铲土机在做铲除草皮工作。按规定是七点钟上班开动马达，可是每当早晨七点钟打上工铃的时候，寝室的人都不见了，这时候工地上的机器已经吼叫起来；下午下班铃打了很久，而人们又舍不得离开，像被什么迷住了似的。工人提出：能多作一小时工，不迟到一分钟。每天实际工作总是增加了一个多钟点。
    现在，工地的平土工程开始施工了，这是整个工程的第一步。要完成这个规模巨大的建设还有许多艰难的事要做，这还只是开头。全国总工会号召我们：努力提高文化和技术水平、开展劳动竞赛、提高劳动生产率、厉行节约，保证工程的“快、好、省、安全”，这是完全正确的。我们表示坚决的响应。我们是亲身投入我们的前人从来没有作过的极其光荣伟大的事业，全国人民都期望着我们工业建设做好，我们决不辜负全国人民的期望。为了祖国的繁荣，我们工人阶级决心贡献出全部智慧和精力。
