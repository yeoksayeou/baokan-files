Experiences in Participating in the Establishment of the Agricultural Cooperative in Huoshaozhai Village, Xianyang County
    Chen Zuoshu

    In February of this year, I participated in the work of establishing an agricultural cooperative in Huoshaozhai Village, Xindian Township, Xianyang County. After the cooperative was established, I stayed there to help with the work until the autumn planting. In this nearly half a year, I witnessed the growth of a cooperative and personally came into contact with many simple farmers. In this mass movement, I received a good education.

    Huoshaozhai Village has a total of 143 households. Among them, apart from five landlord households, three rich peasant households, two small land-renting households, and fifteen middle peasant households, the remaining one hundred or so households are all poor peasants. When we first came to this village, the local staff introduced the situation by saying: the land here isn't bad, most of it is irrigated by wells, but there is little land and many people. The whole village nominally has more than eighty livestock, almost all of which are dilapidated oxen, except for a few mules and horses belonging to some middle peasants. There are a few carts, most of which belong to middle peasants… Seeing this situation, we felt a chill in our hearts. At that time, we doubted whether we could establish a cooperative on such a basis. At that time, the three of us who arrived first lived in the township government. Because the district hadn't sent anyone yet, and we had such doubts in our hearts, we didn't tell the masses that we were here to help establish a cooperative. But the masses, seeing these working staff, guessed it, and sooner or later they would discuss the establishment of the cooperative in twos and threes. Some poor peasants came to inquire about when the cooperative would be established and how many cooperatives would be established. There was a poor peasant named Zhou Zhenbang, who had worked for landlords for seven or eight years before liberation. He was allocated some land during the land reform and started living with his wife and children. Because he lacked this and that, his life was still very hard. He told us: “Last winter, we were ready to establish a cooperative, but we waited and waited without seeing any cadres come…” At this time, we felt that the farmers in this village were enthusiastic, and the establishment of a cooperative might be hopeful.

    When the establishment of the cooperative began, we did more than twenty days of propaganda and education work, and some farmers became impatient and often ran to ask about the registration, saying that they were ready and just waiting to register, and as soon as it was announced, they would be the first to register! There was a poor peasant named Li Hanyong, a poor young man who had been driving carts for others all year round. When he heard that the village was going to establish a cooperative, he stayed. He told me, "I didn't even have a home in previous years, only four mu of land, so I had to work outside. I haven't made a name for myself in the past few years, and even the land has been neglected. Now that the village is establishing a cooperative, I want to settle down in the cooperative and no longer work outside. Old Chen, do you think that will work!" I knew what he was worried about. He was afraid that there would be too many people registering, and since he had neither livestock nor farm tools, he was afraid of being rejected, so he wanted to register with me first. It turned out that agricultural cooperatives had such a great attraction for farmers! At this time, I began to understand some of the reasons why farmers were so enthusiastic about joining the cooperative.

    Registration to join the cooperative began on May 15th, and seventy-two households of farmers registered in one day. Among them, apart from ten middle peasant households, the remaining sixty or so households were all poor peasants. Later, twelve poor peasant households including Li Hanfu and one middle peasant household resolutely requested to join the cooperative. Originally, we were afraid that too few people would register, but contrary to our expectations, eighty-five households registered at once, and there were still several poor peasant households preparing to register. Then, we were afraid that too many people would register. Therefore, among us staff members, there was a great dispute over the issue of these thirteen farmers who registered later. Although we still accepted them into the cooperative, in my mind, I always thought that these people were following the crowd, and I disliked them for being backward, and I showed a kind of disgust everywhere. Not long after Li Hanfu joined the cooperative, his wife quarreled with the cooperative director because of pulling a bullock to grind flour, and cried and demanded to withdraw from the cooperative. At that time, I only wanted my work to go smoothly, so I took an indifferent attitude and directly proposed to them "withdraw if you want to withdraw." In fact, I knew his family background. I remembered that Li Hanfu had told me about something that happened four or five years before liberation: at that time, the landlord Yin Baoquan in the village, using the false signboard of the "children's association," ostensibly said that he was trying to find a way for the poor, but in reality, he was taking grain from the poor and then lending it back to them. Hanfu fell into this trap, and in just three years, a big cart (worth four stones of wheat) was taken away, and two fat pigs were also driven away. People were still plotting his land, and his family property was ruined in this way. A farmer like this who had suffered extreme exploitation in the old society was very willing to take the socialist road. The fact that he and his wife said they wanted to withdraw from the cooperative was just a temporary fit of anger. Therefore, when I formally raised the issue of withdrawing from the cooperative, they explained to me again, saying that they did not want to withdraw from the cooperative in their hearts. At that time, I did not see the aspect of their consciousness, but only grasped some selfish and self-interested minor faults of the small-property-owning peasants, and adopted an inhumane approach.

    Not long after the cooperative was established, other comrades left, leaving me to help with the work of consolidating the cooperative. At that time, I felt that the cooperative was so big and there were so many difficulties, so I was always worried about whether the cooperative could be consolidated.

    Because the cooperative was newly established, everyone was not used to collective production, and quarrels often occurred. They could cause discord between teams for the sake of harnessing an ox; they could argue until midnight for recording one work point. One evening during the summer harvest, the three groups of the third brigade quarreled fiercely for the sake of harnessing a big cart the next day. The poor peasant member Guo Jinxi, who didn't get the cart, shouted everywhere, saying, "No cart, no livestock, that will kill people, I will withdraw from the cooperative tomorrow!" Some people even shouted: "We might as well stop production!" Seeing this situation, my head ached. I couldn't sleep all night, and I was very worried that production would stop tomorrow. The next morning, I got up and ran to the village to see what was happening. I saw that everyone was still working in the fields, neither arguing nor making noise, and no one was proposing to withdraw from the cooperative. I still didn't believe it, so I asked the brigade leader Li Tingming: "What is going on in the team?" He smiled and said: "We are 'a broken pot covered with scars' (浑 means whole), don't look at the fierce quarrels, isn't it just a dispute and then it's over, production will never stop, it's nothing!" Later, many facts proved that this was indeed the case. But I was so afraid of their quarrels because I didn't understand the farmers. Their quarrels were only for harnessing cattle, for assigning work, for evaluating work points, or for other personal interests, which was very natural for small-property-owning peasants; but they would not doubt and quarrel about running a cooperative or taking the socialist road. What this farmer said, "a broken pot covered with scars," was indeed reasonable. And the cooperative was in this situation, experienced the drought resistance before the summer harvest, the tense summer harvest, and the recent drought resistance and autumn planting tests, and gradually consolidated.

    The fact that the cooperative was consolidated was an encouragement to me. But when I was about to leave here at the end of July, I felt very guilty again. On the night before I left, I exchanged views on the cooperative with the cooperative staff. Talking about the leadership issue of the cooperative, I asked them "do you have the confidence to run the cooperative well?" The cooperative director Zhou Zhenbang said with a smile: "It's hard to say, but from the second or third month of establishment, every day has been dealing with difficulties; everyone has no experience, the cooperative has nothing... Although it's been a scare for people, they've all come through one hurdle after another, and now it's better than that time..." These few relaxed words of his were a great encouragement to me. But after leaving, I was still not at ease. On August 17th, I returned to the Huoshaozhai Village Agricultural Cooperative again. The situation changed so quickly, only about twenty days after leaving, the corn was already black and pressed high above people's heads. On the east side of the village, I first encountered the deputy director Li Chunsheng. I was just about to ask if anything had happened in the cooperative recently, and he began to tell me about the autumn irrigation, saying: "The cooperative is really united this time, the labor is really beautiful! You see, it has been ten days since the autumn irrigation started, and the members are working day and night. The whole cooperative has dozens of waterwheels pushed by people alone, and nearly twenty pulleys have also been mobilized..." Several members I met asked me: "You are running to see the cooperative, what do you think of the labor in the cooperative?" Indeed, the production of the cooperative has taken a step forward compared to the past, and the production enthusiasm of the members has also increased. Nearly 750 mu of autumn crops in the whole cooperative, most of them were irrigated by the members pushing waterwheels and moving pulleys, and have all been watered once, and have started watering a second time. The few members who were slightly shaken have now been attracted by this promising scene of the autumn harvest.

    Now the problem is very clear: at the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, I thought the masses were backward and doubted whether the cooperative could be established; after the cooperative was established, I was afraid of collapse and worried about whether it could be consolidated; when I was about to leave, I was worried that the staff of the cooperative could not lead it. However, the facts completely exceeded my expectations. Where is the problem? It turned out that I was lagging behind the objective reality and made an incorrect assessment of the farmers under the leadership of the Party today, especially the poor peasants. I did not see the essential aspect of their belief in the Party and their firm willingness to take the socialist road, but only looked at the problem from the aspect of the private psychology of small producers, so it is no wonder that there would be doubts, wavering, and even panic in the entire process of establishing the cooperative.

    参加咸阳县火烧寨村建社工作的体会
    陈作枢
    今年二月间，我参加了咸阳县新店乡火烧寨村的建立农业合作社工作。社建成后，又留在那里帮助工作，一直到种上秋。在这近半年的时间里，我亲眼看到一个社的成长，亲自接触了许多朴实的农民。在这个群众运动中，我受到了一次很好的教育。
    火烧寨村共有一百四十三户人家。其中除去五户地主、三户富农、两户小土地出租者、十五户中农外，其余的一百多户全是贫农。当我们开始来到这个村庄时，当地工作人员介绍情况说：这里土地倒也不坏，大部分都是井浇地，只是地少人多。全村名义上说有八十多条牲口，除过几户中农的几条骡马外，几乎全是烂烂牛。大车有几辆，大部是中农的……一看这个情况，我们心里凉了半截。当时我们很怀疑：在这样的基础上，是不是能建起一个社来？那时，我们先去的三个人，住在乡政府里。因为当时区上还没来人，加上我们心里有这样的怀疑，就没给群众说我们是来帮助建社的。但群众看见来了这些工作人员，就猜着了，早晚都是三三两两地谈论建社的事情。有些贫农就跑来打听什么时候建社、建几个社。有个贫农周振邦，他在解放前给地主扛了七、八年活，土地改革时分到些地，才领着老婆娃娃过日子了。因为少这缺那，日子还是很苦。他告诉我们说：“去年冬里，我们就准备建社了，后来一等两等不见干部来……”这时我们略略感到这村农民还热情，建社可能有希望。
    建社开始了，我们做了二十多天的宣传教育工作，有些农民就等得不耐烦了，经常跑来问报名的事情，说他们已准备好，单等着报名，只要一宣布就要报头一名哩！有个贫农李汉勇，是一个长年在外给人赶车的穷小伙子，听说村里要建社，他就留下了。他告诉我说：“往年连个家都没有，只有四亩多地，只好在外面混，几年来也没混出个啥眉眼，连地也耽搁了。现在村里建社了，我想在社里定下来，不再到外面混了，老陈你看成不成！”我知道他心里的底，他怕报名的多，自己既没牲口、又没农具，恐怕被审查掉，想先在我这里挂个号。原来农业合作社对农民有这样大的吸引力！这时我开始认识到农民为啥要热情入社的一些道理。
    五月十五日开始入社报名，一天就有七十二户农民报名了。其中除了十户中农外，其余的六十多户都是贫农。后来又有李汉富等十二户贫农和一户中农坚决要求入社。原来我们害怕报得少，可是出乎我们所料，一下子报了八十五户，还有几户贫农准备要报名，我们又害怕报得多了。于是我们工作人员之间，在这后报名的十三户农民的入社问题上，发生了很大争执。后来虽然还是接收他们入了社，可是我在思想上，总认为这些人是随大流来的，嫌他们落后，处处流露了一种厌弃的态度。李汉富入社后不久，他老婆因拉牛套磨同社主任吵了一场，就哭闹着要退社。当时我只图自己工作顺利，就抱着掀出去不管的态度，直接向他们提出了“退社就退”。其实我是知道他家底细的，记得李汉富曾向我诉说过他解放前四、五年的一件事情：当时村里的地主殷宝全，拿着“娃娃会”的假招牌，表面上说是给穷人想办法，实际上是从穷人手里把粮食拿去，转过来又放给穷人。汉富就在这个圈套下，只三年把一辆大车（顶了四石麦子）被拉走了，两口肥猪也被赶去，人家还在谋算着他的地，家业就这样完了。像这样一个在旧社会遭受极端压榨的农民，是很愿意走社会主义道路的，他夫妇说要退社，只是一时的气话，所以在我正式提出退社问题时，他们又给我作解释，说心里并不想退社。当时，我没有看到他们觉悟的方面，仅仅抓住农民小私有者的一些自私自利的小毛病，采取了不近人情的作法。
    社建成后不久，其他同志都走了，把我留下来帮助做巩固社的工作。当时我觉得社这样大，困难很多，因此又时时忧虑这个社能不能巩固。
      因为社初建立，大家还不习惯于集体生产，互相争吵的事情经常发生。他们为着套一头牛，就可以引起队同队的不和气；为了记一分工，就一直吵到半夜。夏收期间的一个晚上，第三大队的三个小组，为争第二天套的一辆大车，吵得很厉害，贫农社员郭金喜没争到车，就到处喊叫说：“没车没牲口，那就要人的命，我明天下社哩！”有些人还叫喊着：干脆把生产停了算了！看到这种情况，我头就痛起来了。夜里翻来复去睡不着，很担心明天生产会停顿。第二天早上，爬起来就跑去村里看动静。一看大家仍然都下地干活了，既不吵、也不闹了，更没有人提出退社了。我还不相信，就问大队长李廷明：“队里到底怎么样？”他笑着说：“我们这是‘锅烂疤子浑’（浑是全的意思），你不要看吵得厉害，还不是争一下就罢了，生产总是不会停的，没啥！”后来许多事实证明，的确就是这样。但我对他们的争吵那样害怕，原来是我不理解农民。他们的争吵，只不过是为套牛、为派活、为评工或其他个人利益的事情，这在小私有者的农民来说，原是很自然的事情；可是对办社、对走社会主义的道路，他们是不会怀疑而争吵的。这个农民所说的“锅烂疤子浑”，确有道理。而社也就在这种情况下，经历了夏收前的防旱抗旱、紧张的夏收、不久前的抗旱种秋等考验，逐步巩固下来了。
    社巩固了的事实，对我是一个鼓舞。但当七月底我要离开这里的时候，又觉得很心虚。在离开的前一晚上，我曾同社的工作人员交换了一下对社的意见。谈到社的领导问题，我问他们“是不是有信心把社办好”？社主任周振邦笑着说：“这话很难说，不过打二三月建立起，没一天不是同困难打交道；大家没经验，社里要啥没啥……虽说叫人担了一场惊，都一关一关地过来了，现在总比那时节好过些……”他这几句轻松的话，对我却是很大的鼓励。可是离开后总还不放心，八月十七日，我又回到火烧寨村农业合作社来。情况变化真快，只离开二十天的样子，玉米已黑压压地高过了人头。在村子东边，首先碰到副主任李春盛，我正准备要问社里最近发生了什么事情没有，他就滔滔不绝地给我讲起了浇秋的事情，他说：“社里这一次真齐心，劳动真个美！你看打浇秋开始到现在已经十天了，社员都是白天黑夜地赶。全社只人推的水车就有成十部，另外还出动了近二十把辘轳……”碰到的几个社员都问我：“你是跑来看社的，你看社里的劳动到底咋着哩？”的确，社里的生产又比过去前进了一步，社员的生产积极性也更加高了。全社近七百五十亩的秋庄稼，大部分就是凭社员们推水车、搬辘轳，全部浇过了一遍水，并且又开始浇二遍水了。原来稍微动摇的几户社员，现在都被这一片秋收有望的景象吸引住了。
    现在问题看得很清楚：建社初，我认为群众落后，怀疑能不能建成社；社既建成了，又怕垮台，顾虑它能不能巩固；临走时又担心社的工作人员领导不起来。可是，事实完全超出了我的意想。毛病在哪里呢？原来我是落在了客观实际的后面，对于今天在党的领导下的农民，特别是对贫农，作了不正确的估计。没有看到他们相信党和坚决愿走社会主义道路的本质一面，而只是从小生产者私有心理的一面看问题，因此也就无怪在整个建社过程中要发生怀疑、动摇以至惊惶失措了。（原载陕西日报）
