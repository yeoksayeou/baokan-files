In the Season of Harvest

    Shagou Lake, a well-known depression in the northern Jiangsu Huaihai Plain between Xinyi and Pi Counties, is connected to the Machang of Pi County, encompassing about 100,000 mu of fertile land. In the past, whenever it rained, water from around forty miles would flow here, and continuous rainfall of 150 to 200 millimeters would turn it into a vast expanse of water. Now, it presents a scene of bumper harvest everywhere. Everywhere there are purple-red sorghum, golden corn, lush green soybeans, and sweet potato vines covering the land.

    Thanks to the good water conservancy projects this year, the corn planting area has been expanded to 1,435 mu, an increase of 251 mu compared to last year. The average yield per mu has reached 330 jin, an increase of 41 jin compared to last year. The soybean planting area has been expanded by 757 mu compared to last year, with the highest yield per mu reaching 300 jin and the lowest being over 100 jin. Last year, the average yield of soybeans was only 98 jin per mu. In the former Shagou Village of Shagou Township, 2,500 mu out of 2,980 mu of land were affected by disasters in 1950, with a yield of only 120 jin per mu in both the wheat and autumn harvests. This year, the estimated unit yield is at least 250 jin per mu, doubling that of 1950.

    沙沟湖一片丰收景色
    苏北淮海平原上的著名洼地之一——新沂县和邳县之间的沙沟湖，同邳县马场连接起来，方圆约有十万多亩肥沃土地。过去每逢降雨，周围四十里路雨水往这里淌，只要连续降雨一百五十公厘到二百公厘，就会变成一片汪洋。现在，到处呈现一片丰收景色。到处是紫红色的高粱，金黄色的玉米，长得绿油油的大豆，以及覆盖大地的甘薯藤。
    由于今年农田水利工程做得好，玉米播种面积扩大到一千四百三十五亩，比去年增加了二百五十一亩，单位产量平均获得三百三十斤，比去年增产四十一斤。大豆播种面积比去年扩大了七百五十七亩，单位产量最高可产三百斤，最低也在一百斤以上。而去年的大豆平均每亩只产九十八斤。沙沟乡的前沙沟村二千九百八十亩地，在一九五○年有二千五百亩地受灾，麦秋两季每亩只产一百二十斤，而今年的单位产量，估计每亩至少有二百五十斤，比一九五○年提高了一倍。
