Localities Issue Poor Peasant Cooperative Fund Loans

    (By this newspaper) Various localities are issuing poor peasant cooperative fund loans. According to incomplete statistics as of early September, over 16 million yuan has been issued nationwide. Hunan Province, where the issuance work is progressing faster, has issued 59.1% of the poor peasant cooperative fund loans planned for the second half of the year. In Anhui Province, more than half of the counties have issued the poor peasant cooperative fund loans to individual households. By mid-August, Heilongjiang Province had issued over 2.3 million yuan in poor peasant cooperative fund loans, benefiting over 59,400 poor peasant members and individual new middle peasant members with difficulties in over 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives.

    The regions that have already issued poor peasant cooperative fund loans have resolved the difficulty of insufficient funds for poor peasant members to join cooperatives, enhanced the political and economic status of poor peasants within agricultural production cooperatives, strengthened the unity between poor and middle peasants, and further consolidated the agricultural production cooperatives. In the past, in Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xin County, Shanxi Province, poor peasant members could not afford to invest, and middle peasants were worried and unwilling to invest, which affected the unity between poor and middle peasants and the consolidation of the cooperative. Now, twelve poor peasant members in this cooperative have received 265 yuan in poor peasant cooperative fund loans, resolving the investment problem. The poor peasant members said: The government is always concerned about and taking care of us; let's work hard. The middle peasant members said: Now we can put down our ideological baggage and concentrate on production, and not be half-hearted. Xinghua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinchang Village, Second District, Xingtai County, Hebei Province, received 265 yuan in poor peasant cooperative fund loans, enabling seven poor peasant members to pay off their shares for joining the cooperative, which encouraged the middle peasant members to invest actively. The members quickly invested over 2,500 yuan, further consolidating the cooperative.

    The issuance of poor peasant cooperative fund loans has encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of agricultural production cooperative members. After the poor peasant members of twenty-two agricultural production cooperatives in Nijing Township, Changli County, Hebei Province, received loans, the cooperatives promptly purchased production materials such as fertilizers and pesticides, and actively launched production activities such as topdressing, treating cotton aphids, and accumulating manure. After the poor peasant members of Yanshangba Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baiguo Township, Tongzi County, Guizhou Province, received loans, the members' production enthusiasm soared, and they worked 250 labor days in three days to hoe ground ash, completing the second weeding two days ahead of schedule, and set a plan to accumulate 25,000 jin of green manure.

    The issuance of poor peasant cooperative fund loans has also promoted the development of agricultural production cooperatives. According to statistics from eight counties in Anhui Province, including Feixi, Qianshan, and Wuhe, more than 400 poor peasant households have joined old cooperatives or formed new cooperatives after receiving loans. After the issuance of poor peasant cooperative fund loans in Bukou Township, Sui County, Henan Province, more than 70 peasant households applied to join agricultural production cooperatives within seven or eight days. Many poor and middle peasants who had not joined cooperatives in the past because they could not afford to invest or were afraid of suffering losses are now also requesting to join agricultural production cooperatives.

    各地发放贫农合作基金贷款
    本报讯　各地正在发放贫农合作基金贷款。截至九月上旬不完全的统计，全国已发放出一千六百多万元。发放工作进行较快的湖南省，发放出的贫农合作基金贷款已达下半年计划发放数的百分之五十九点一；安徽省半数以上的县已经把贫农合作基金贷款发放到户。黑龙江省到八月中旬就已经发放出贫农合作基金贷款二百三十多万元，有一万五千多个农业生产合作社的五万九千四百多户贫农社员和个别有困难的新中农社员得到了这项贷款。
    已经发放贫农合作基金贷款的地区，解决了贫农社员入社费用不足的困难，提高了贫农在农业生产合作社内的政治和经济地位，加强了贫农和中农之间的团结，使农业生产合作社得到了进一步的巩固。山西省忻县光明农业生产合作社过去贫农社员投不起资，中农有顾虑，不愿投资，这样就影响了贫农、中农之间的团结和社的巩固。现在这个社有十二户贫农社员得到了贫农合作基金贷款二百六十五元，解决了投资问题。贫农社员说：政府时刻关怀、照顾咱们，好好地干吧。中农社员说：这下可放下了思想包袱，安心搞生产吧，可别三心二意了。河北省邢台县第二区心长村兴华农业生产合作社得到贫农合作基金贷款二百六十五元，使七户贫农社员缴清了入社股金，因而鼓舞了中农社员投资的积极性。社员们很快投资二千五百多元，使这个社得到了进一步的巩固。
    经过发放贫农合作基金贷款，鼓舞了广大农业生产合作社社员的生产积极性。河北省昌黎县泥井乡二十二个农业生产合作社的贫农社员得到贷款以后，社内及时买了肥料、农药等生产资料，积极展开追肥、治棉蚜和积肥等生产活动。贵州省桐梓县柏果乡岩上坝农业生产合作社贫农社员得到贷款以后，社员们生产热情高涨，三天中出工铲地灰二百五十次，提前两天薅完二道秧，并订出积青草肥二万五千斤的计划。
    贫农合作基金贷款的发放也促进了农业生产合作社的发展。安徽省据肥西、潜山、五河等八个县的统计，已经有四百多户贫农得到贷款后参加了老社或组成了新社。河南省睢县埠口乡发放贫农合作基金贷款以后，七八天内就有七十多户农民申请参加农业生产合作社。许多过去因为投不起资或怕吃亏而没有入社的贫农和中农，现在也纷纷要求参加农业生产合作社了。
