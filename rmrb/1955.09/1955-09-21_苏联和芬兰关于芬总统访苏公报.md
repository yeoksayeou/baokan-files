Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 20th, TASS dispatch from Moscow, September 19th: Communiqué of the Soviet Union and Finland regarding the visit of the President of the Republic of Finland, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, to Moscow.

At the invitation of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, K.Y. Voroshilov, the President of the Republic of Finland, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, visited the Soviet Union from September 16th to 20th. Accompanying the President were: Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen, Minister of Defense Skog, Minister Svento, and State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Seppälä.

The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, and the President of the Republic of Finland, Paasikivi, exchanged views on issues related to Soviet-Finnish relations and certain international issues.

The Soviet side participating in the talks included: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Bulganin, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Khrushchev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR Molotov, and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Pervukhin.

The Republic of Finland was represented in the talks by: Prime Minister Kekkonen, Minister of Defense Skog, Minister Svento, and State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Seppälä.

The talks were conducted in a spirit of sincere trust, candor, and mutual understanding. During the talks, both sides pursued the desire to further strengthen the existing friendly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union, which are based on mutual non-interference in internal affairs, mutual respect for national sovereignty and national independence, and are in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Organization.

Both sides noted with satisfaction the development of effective cooperation in the economic and cultural fields, which is particularly manifested in the conclusion of new long-term trade agreements and scientific and technological cooperation agreements between the Soviet Union and Finland; and both sides expressed their willingness to continue to develop this cooperation for the benefit of both countries.

Both sides agreed that the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and Finland, signed on April 6, 1948, is a solid foundation for strengthening the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland and contributes to strengthening peace and security in Northern Europe. The two sides agreed to extend the validity of this treaty for twenty years and to sign a corresponding protocol.

In view of the good neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, and taking into account the recent, particularly after the Geneva meeting of the heads of government of the four powers, some easing of international tension, for the benefit of Finland, the Soviet government considers it possible to waive its right, under the peace treaty with Finland signed on February 10, 1947, to lease the Finnish territory of Porkkala Udd for a period of fifty years to establish a naval base for the Soviet Union. To this end, the Soviet government has decided to abolish the naval base at Porkkala Udd, withdraw the Soviet troops stationed there, and transfer the leased territory of Porkkala Udd to Finland. At the same time, the Soviet government will gratuitously transfer to the Finnish government the housing, public utilities, warehouses, and other buildings, port facilities, docks, and other structures built by the Soviet side in the Porkkala Udd area.

The Soviet and Finnish governments affirm that in their foreign policy they will continue to strive for further relaxation of international tension and to promote the cause of ensuring peace and the security of all nations.

The participants in the Finnish-Soviet talks carefully and frankly discussed all issues related to Finnish-Soviet relations during the negotiations and expressed their respective points of view.

This exchange of views between the President of the Republic of Finland and the accompanying personnel on the one hand, and the Soviet leaders on the other, conducted in an atmosphere of full confidence and in the friendly spirit of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in 1948, will contribute to further strengthening the friendly ties and mutual trust between Finland and the Soviet Union for the happiness of the Finnish and Soviet peoples.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of Finland signed in Moscow on September 19 a protocol extending the validity of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed on April 6, 1948, and an agreement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of Finland on the Soviet Union's waiver of its right to use the Porkkala Udd naval base and the withdrawal of Soviet armed forces from this area.

    苏联和芬兰关于芬总统访苏公报
    新华社二十日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：苏联和芬兰两国关于芬兰共和国总统尤·库·巴锡基维访问莫斯科的公报。
    芬兰共和国总统尤·库·巴锡基维应苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫的邀请，于九月十六日到二十日在苏联访问。陪同总统前来的有：芬兰总理吉科宁、国防部长斯科格、部长斯汶托和外交部国务秘书塞帕拉。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫和芬兰共和国总统巴锡基维就有关苏芬两国关系的问题和某些国际问题交换了意见。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫、苏联部长会议第一副主席兼苏联外交部长莫洛托夫和苏联部长会议第一副主席别尔乌辛。
    芬兰共和国方面参加会谈的有：总理吉科宁、国防部长斯科格、部长斯汶托和外交部国务秘书塞帕拉。
    会谈是本着真诚信任、诚恳和互相谅解的精神进行的。在会谈中，双方贯彻了要求进一步加强芬兰和苏联两国之间现有的友好关系的愿望，这种关系的基础是互不干涉内政、互相尊重国家主权和民族独立，并且符合联合国组织的目的和原则。
    双方满意地指出了经济和文化方面有效合作的发展，这种发展特别表现为：缔结了苏芬两国新的长期贸易协定和科学技术合作协定；双方并且表示愿意继续为两国的利益发展这种合作。
    双方一致认为，一九四八年四月六日签订的苏芬友好合作互助条约是加强苏联同芬兰两国之间的友好关系的巩固基础，并且有助于加强欧洲北部的和平和安全。双方同意把这一条约的有效期限延长二十年，并且签订相应的议定书。
    鉴于苏芬两国的良好睦邻关系，并且考虑到最近、特别是四国政府首脑日内瓦会议以后所取得的国际紧张局势的某些缓和，为了芬兰的利益，苏联政府认为，可以放弃根据一九四七年二月十日签订的对芬和约以五十年的期限租借给苏联建立海军基地的芬兰领土波卡拉乌德的租借权。为此，苏联政府决定取消在波卡拉乌德的海军基地，撤出驻在那里的苏联军队，并且把租借地波卡拉乌德移交给芬兰。同时，苏联政府将无偿地把苏方在波卡拉乌德地区建设的住宅、公用生活房舍、仓库和其他用屋、港口设备连同码头及其他建筑物交给芬兰政府。
    苏联政府和芬兰政府肯定，它们在外交政策方面今后仍将努力争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势和促进保障和平和各国人民安全的事业。
    芬苏两国参加会谈的人员在谈判中仔细地和开诚布公地讨论了有关芬苏关系的一切问题，并且表示了双方的观点。
    芬兰共和国总统和陪同他的人员为一方同苏联领导人员为另一方，在充分信任的气氛中根据一九四八年所签订的友好合作互助条约的友好精神进行的这次交换意见，将有助于为芬兰和苏联两国人民的幸福而进一步加强芬兰和苏联两国之间的友好联系和相互信任。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和芬兰共和国九月十九日在莫斯科签订了关于延长一九四八年四月六日签订的友好合作互助条约的有效期限的议定书以及苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和芬兰共和国关于苏联放弃使用波卡拉乌德海军基地的权利和从这个地区撤退苏联武装部队的协定。
