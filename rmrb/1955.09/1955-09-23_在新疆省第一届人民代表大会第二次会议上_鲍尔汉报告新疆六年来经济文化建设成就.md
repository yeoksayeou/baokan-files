    At the Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province (September 20th), Bao Erhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, delivered a report on the work of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government over the past six years. When discussing the achievements of Xinjiang in restoring and developing the national economy, Bao Erhan said in his report that agriculture has seen great development. In recent years, the number of farming households joining agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams has reached 66.38% of the total number of farming households. Farmers of all ethnic groups and the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have worked hard to build water conservancy projects, adding more than 4.87 million mu of irrigated area by 1954. This has increased the total sown area of various crops in Xinjiang Province in 1954 by 25.14% compared to 1949. The total output of various major crops increased by 65.44% compared to 1949.

    Over the past six years, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government has actively led the development of animal husbandry production, and implemented the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry, including the economy of livestock owners. By 1954, the number of various livestock had increased to more than 17,082,000 head, an increase of 42% compared to 1949, and the output of various wools and hairs in 1954 increased by 87% compared to 1949.

    In the past six years, Xinjiang Province has established a total of twenty-seven large-scale state-owned and locally state-owned modern factories and mines. Twenty-one more are currently under construction and expansion. The total industrial output value in 1954 increased by 14 and a half times compared to 1949 (the vast majority of which is the growth of newly built modern industrial output value). These industries have played a significant role in supporting agricultural and animal husbandry production and improving the living standards of people of all ethnic groups. Under the active leadership and support of the Provincial People's Government, handicrafts have also achieved considerable development, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement of handicrafts is steadily developing.

    The total length of highways in Xinjiang is now more than 8,540 kilometers, an increase of 41.7% compared to 1949. The number of transport vehicles has increased tenfold compared to 1950, ensuring freight and passenger transport and enlivening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

    The state-owned commerce of Xinjiang Province has become a huge force leading the market and promoting industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, basically meeting the needs of people of all ethnic groups for means of production and means of livelihood, and developing foreign trade at the same time.

    Bao Erhan said: Xinjiang's cultural, educational, and health undertakings have developed rapidly. In the past six years, 138 health institutions such as provincial, prefectural, and county (city) people's hospitals and epidemic prevention stations have been restored and built. The number of health institutions has increased by 1.5 times compared to before liberation, the number of medical personnel has increased by more than five times compared to before liberation, and the number of beds has increased by more than one time compared to before liberation. A modern Xinjiang Medical College is now under construction. When this project is completed, it will not only be a medical education center in Xinjiang, but also a base for medical scientific research and medical work. As of the first half of 1955, the number of primary and secondary school students in Xinjiang has greatly increased, especially higher education has seen even greater development. There are now three institutions of higher learning: Xinjiang College, August 1st Agricultural College, and Russian Language College. Three secondary technical schools for mining, health, and agriculture have also been established. In addition, great achievements have also been made in literature and art, film, publishing, broadcasting, and other work.

    在新疆省第一届人民代表大会第二次会议上
    鲍尔汉报告新疆六年来经济文化建设成就
    在新疆省第一届人民代表大会第二次会议上（九月二十日），新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉作了关于新疆省人民政府六年来工作的报告。鲍尔汉在报告中讲到新疆恢复和发展国民经济的成就时说：在农业方面已经有了很大的发展。几年来加入农业生产合作社和互助组的农户已占到总农户的百分之六十六点三八。各族农民和中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队，努力兴修水利，到一九五四年共增加灌溉面积四百八十七万多亩，这就使得新疆省一九五四年各种作物播种的总面积比一九四九年增加了百分之二十五点一四。各种主要作物的总产量比一九四九年增加百分之六十五点四四。
    六年来，新疆省人民政府积极领导发展畜牧业生产，贯彻执行了保护和发展包括牧主经济在内的畜牧业政策，到一九五四年各种牲畜已增加到一千七百零八万二千多头，比一九四九年增加了百分之四十二，各种绒毛产量一九五四年比一九四九年增加了百分之八十七。
    六年来新疆省共建立了二十七座规模较大的国营和地方国营的现代化厂矿。今年正在修建和扩建的还有二十一座。工业的总产值一九五四年比一九四九年增长了十四倍半（绝大部分是新建的现代工业产值的增长），这些工业在支援农牧业生产和改善各族人民生活上起了很大的作用。在省人民政府积极领导和扶持下，手工业也获得了相当的发展，并正稳步地开展手工业互助合作运动。
    现在新疆境内公路全长八千五百四十多公里，比一九四九年增加了百分之四十一点七，运输汽车的数目比一九五零年增加了十倍，保证了货运和客运，活跃了城乡物资交流。
    新疆省的国营商业已成为领导市场和促进工、农、牧业生产的一个巨大力量，基本上满足了各族人民对生产资料和生活资料的需要，同时发展了对外贸易。
    鲍尔汉说：新疆文教卫生事业发展很快，六年来恢复和修建了省、专区、县（市）人民医院、防疫站等卫生机构有一百三十八个。卫生机构比解放前增加了一点五倍，医务人员比解放前增加了五倍多，病床比解放前增加了一倍多。现在正在修建一座近代化的新疆医学院，这项工程全部完工后，不但是新疆的一个医学教育中心，而且是医学科学研究及医疗工作的基地。截至一九五五年上半年，新疆小学学生和中学学生有很大增加，特别是高等教育有了更大的发展。现有新疆学院、八一农学院和俄文专科学校三所高等学校。还创办了矿山、卫生、农业三所中等技术学校。此外，在文学艺术、电影、出版、广播等工作方面也都有很大成绩。
