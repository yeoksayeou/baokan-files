    Please Write for Children and Young People
    Guo Moruo
    For the past twenty or thirty years, I have felt something strange: why are there so few literary works aimed at children and young people in our China? It was like this in the old days, it has been like this since the May Fourth Movement, and even recently it doesn't seem to have changed much.
    In China, from ancient times to the present, it seems that no writer can be pointed out as a specialist in children's literature; we have not even encountered a special collection of children's literature like "Grimm's Fairy Tales" (a collection of folk tales collected by the Grimm brothers of Germany).
    China is the country with the most children. The famous Soviet writer Korneichuk came to China in March this year and traveled to many places in China. He once said to me in Chongqing: There are children everywhere! No other country in the world has as many children as China!
    We are proud to have so many children. But, alas! China is probably the country with the least children's literature!
    What is the reason for this? So many children, yet so little children's literature!
    Do children not need literature? That's not the case. Children are really eager for children's reading materials.
    Old-fashioned comic books are welcomed to an almost frightening extent. Not only is the content problematic, unhealthy, and toxic, but the books are flipped through until they are almost as black as the printed content. However, children can stand and flip through them for hours in the streets and alleys.
    New comic books are naturally also very popular. I myself have five children studying in primary and secondary schools, and they are comic book experts. They really read every book, and once they start reading, they don't even want to eat.
    Can we say that children don't need literature? Of course not!
    We are currently paying close attention to banning unhealthy and toxic reading materials aimed at children and young people, which is a very necessary emergency measure to protect our new generation.
    But we must ask: Are our writers completely without responsibility for allowing those toxic things to run rampant, and for making children eat whatever they can get?
    The most proactive way to ban toxic and bad reading materials is to produce more good works with high moral qualities and artistic standards.
    The mass publication of new comic books is very necessary, but here I have discovered a phenomenon—that is, more than 80 percent of the content of the books is taken from Soviet works. Soviet works are of great educational significance to us, and children also welcome them, which is naturally very good. However, where have the Chinese writers gone?
    I can say with some certainty that most Chinese writers do not value children, and therefore do not value children's literature. If this is not correct, I hope that there will be more contrary facts to overturn my incorrect inference.
    Children and young people are the masters of the future country, the main force in national construction in a few years or a dozen years. Why can't we give them the attention they deserve?
    We cannot let children and young people lack material food and become street urchins. Can we bear to let children and young people lack spiritual food and become spiritual urchins?
    Today and in the future, we must build our motherland into a socialist and communist country. The builders of our country must be cultivated into such people—with communist moral qualities and a materialist worldview.
    Children are highly malleable. The ancients used plain silk as a metaphor: "Dyed in blue, it becomes blue; dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow." It is very difficult to transform adults.
    We all know that literature is a good tool for cultivating moral qualities and establishing a correct outlook on life, but why don't we give due attention to children and young people who are easy to mold and urgently need molding, and why don't we make good use of the tools in our hands?
    Perhaps some friends are thinking like this: Engaging in children's literature is not promising, the scope is not big, the level is not high, and it is not enough to become a great writer.
    If anyone has such an idea, I dare say that this person's soul still has problems. It's too vain!
    In fact, children's literature is the most difficult thing to do well. I think like this: a person must be relatively free of spiritual dross in order to create good children's literature.
    We cannot be too naive about enemies and counter-revolutionaries; but for pure children and young people, our naivety will not feel excessive.
    To do good children's literature, it is necessary to strive to restore the lively and pure spirit of our own childhood, and to strive to gain an in-depth understanding of the lives of today's children and young people.
    In order to constantly forge our own souls and the souls of the new generation, let us write more children's and young people's literature.
    Efforts to write children's literature can not only practice the task of "soul engineer" but also improve the level of art—that is, "improve on the basis of popularization." I don't want to say more about the reasons, because everyone can imagine them.
    I would like to sincerely make a suggestion: within a year or two, every writer should write at least one thing for children and young people. Be it poetry, novels, or plays. It would be good, needless to say, to translate old Chinese stories and fables into modern language and compile them into special collections.
    But today, to establish a materialist worldview, we must require the content of our works to have a corresponding basis of scientific knowledge. Old children's stories or fables are often based on pure fantasy, and many of them are not suitable for today's requirements.
    I can give an example, like the fable "The Bee and the Butterfly," which says that the bee is simple and hardworking in summer, so it has food in winter; the butterfly only cares about beauty and only plays in summer, so it starves to death in autumn.
    This is a fable passed down from Europe, and it has educational significance, but it violates the most basic scientific common sense. Recently, I also saw this fable in our children's publications, but my children were not satisfied. They said: Butterflies are butterflies, and bees are bees; butterflies don't just play, and they don't starve to death.
    In this way, if the content of the work lacks corresponding scientific knowledge, it will be difficult to receive the intended educational significance.
    From this perspective, we should welcome more the creation of children's literature that reflects the new reality and meets the requirements of the new era.
    Friends, I ask you. If you agree, please include this in your creative plan—within a year or two, write at least one thing for children and young people.

### 请为少年儿童写作

    请为少年儿童写作
    郭沫若
    二三十年来我就感觉着奇怪：在我们中国，以少年儿童为对象的文学作品为什么这样少？在旧时代是这样，在“五四”以来是这样，甚至直到最近似乎也没有多大改变。
    在中国，从古到今，似乎还指不出有哪一位作家是儿童文学的专家；甚至于我们还没有接触到像“格林姆童话集”（德国格林姆兄弟所收集的民间童话）那样的儿童文学的专集。
    中国是儿童最多的国家。苏联的名作家考涅楚克今年三月来中国，在中国走了不少的地方，他在重庆曾经对我说：真是到处都是小朋友！世界上无论哪一国的儿童都没有中国这样多！
    儿童多，在我们是值得夸耀的。但是，可怜！中国却怕要算是儿童文学最少的国家！
    这是什么道理呢？儿童这样多，儿童文学却这样少！
    是儿童们不需要文学吗？不是这样，儿童们对于儿童读物实在是如饥似渴。
    旧式的小人书，那受欢迎的程度，简直是有些可怕。不仅内容有问题，不健康，有毒素，书被翻得差不多和铅印的内容一样墨黑，然而孩子们在街道巷口站着可以翻看好几个钟头。
    新式的小人书自然也很受欢迎。我自己有五个孩子在中、小学读书，他们就是小人书专家。那真是每书必读，一读起来连饭都不要吃。
    这能说儿童们不需要文学吗？当然不能！
    我们目前正在加意取缔那些不健康的、有毒素的以少年儿童为对象的读物，这在保护我们新生的一代上是非常必要的应急处置。
    但是我们要问：让那些毒物横行，让儿童们饥不择食的，我们作家们能够说一点责任也没有吗？
    要取缔有毒素的不良读物，最积极的办法是多多产生出道德品质高、艺术水平高的好作品。
    新式小人书的大量出版是非常必要的，在这里我却发现了一个现象——那就是书的内容采自苏联作品的在百分之八十以上。苏联作品对于我们的教育意义很大，儿童们也很欢迎，这自然是很好的。但是，中国作家们到哪儿去了呢？
    我似乎可以肯定地说：大多数的中国作家们并不重视儿童，因而也就不重视儿童文学。这话假如是说得不正确，我倒希望有更多相反的事实来推翻我这个不正确的推断。
    少年儿童是未来的国家的主人，是几年或十几年后的国家建设的主力军，为什么我们不能加以应有的重视呢？
    我们不能让少年儿童们缺乏物质食粮，成为街头的流浪儿，我们能够忍心让少年儿童们缺乏精神食粮，成为精神上的流浪儿吗？
    今天和今后，我们要把我们的祖国建设成为社会主义和共产主义的国家，我们的国家的建设者就必须陶养成这样的人物——具有共产主义的道德品质和唯物主义的世界观。
    儿童的可塑性大，古人曾把素丝来作譬喻，“染于苍则苍，染于黄则黄”。成人的改造就很不容易。
    我们大家都知道：文学在陶冶道德品质和树立正确的人生观上是很好的工具，但为什么我们对于易于铸造和急需铸造的少年儿童不加以应有的重视，而把在我们的手里的工具也不好好地加以利用呢？
    或许有朋友们在这样想：搞儿童文学没出息，气魄不大，水平不高，不够成为大作家。
    假如谁有这样的想法，我敢于说，这人的灵魂就是还有问题的。太虚夸了！
    事实上儿童文学是最难做好的东西。我是在这样想的：一个人要在精神上比较没有渣滓，才能做得出好的儿童文学。
    对于敌人和反革命分子，我们不能够太天真；但对于纯洁的少年儿童，我们的天真是不会感觉着过剩的。
    要做好儿童文学，有必要努力恢复我们自己的少年儿童时代的活泼纯洁的精神，并努力向今天的少年儿童的生活作深入的体会。
    为了不断地铸造我们自己的灵魂和新生一代的灵魂，我们就请多多写作少年儿童文学吧。
    努力写作儿童文学，不仅可以实践“灵魂工程师”的任务，而且可以使文艺的水平提高——也就是“在普及的基础上提高”。理由不想多说；因为大家都是可以推想得到的。
    我愿意诚恳地提出一个建议：在一二年内，每一位作家都要为少年儿童至少写一篇东西。诗歌也好，小说也好，剧本也好。能够把中国旧有的故事和寓言繙成现代语，并辑成专集，不用说也好。
    但在今天来说，我们要树立唯物主义的世界观，我们就不能不要求作品的内容要有相应的科学知识的基础。旧有的儿童故事或寓言，往往是出于纯粹的空想，有许多同今天的要求是不合适的。
    我可以举一个例，像“蜜蜂与蝴蝶”这个寓言说，蜜蜂朴素，在夏天勤劳，所以在冬天有粮食；蝴蝶只讲好看，在夏天只是玩耍，所以到秋天来便饿死了。
    这是从欧洲传过来的寓言，教育意义是有的，但违背了最基本的科学常识。最近，我在我们的儿童刊物上还看到了这个寓言，但我的孩子们就不满意。他们说：蝴蝶是蝴蝶，蜜蜂是蜜蜂；蝴蝶并不只是玩耍，也不是饿死的。
    这样看来，如果作品的内容缺乏相应的科学知识，那就难于收到所企图的应有的教育意义。
    从这一角度来说，我们应该更欢迎反映新的现实，适合新时代要求的儿童文学的创作。
    朋友们，我向你们请求。假如你们赞成，就请把这订在创作计划里面吧——一二年内，至少要为少年儿童写一篇东西。
