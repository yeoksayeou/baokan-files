Xinhua News Agency, 25th – In the next two years of the national First Five-Year Plan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to establish eleven new research institutions and develop some existing ones to open up many new scientific fields.

The world has entered the atomic age. China will vigorously develop research into the peaceful uses of atomic energy. In our own new China’s laboratories, there will appear atomic reactors and particle accelerators built with Soviet assistance; tracer atoms and various radioactive substances will also be widely used in other scientific fields for research. In physical chemistry, many important disciplines will also be established. For example, aerodynamics is an indispensable science for the aviation industry; plasticity mechanics is related to the improvement of metal forging, steel rolling, and machine manufacturing technology; in inorganic chemistry, the research of physical-chemical analysis is in great demand for alloy manufacturing and large-scale fertilizer production, and the research of rare elements and isotope chemistry has broad uses; in organic chemistry, the research of heavy organic synthesis is the basic way to solve the raw materials for the organic chemical industry.

The Biology and Geosciences Division will carry out theoretical research on Michurin genetics, which is of decisive significance for eradicating bourgeois reactionary academic ideas in genetics and establishing a dialectical materialist research method, correctly understanding the unity of the environment and organisms, and the directional cultivation of organisms, in order to transform organisms and nature according to objective laws. The existing biological research institutions will develop the research of biophysics. This is a young discipline that studies electrophysiology, the application of tracer atoms in biology, and the effects of various rays on life phenomena. Its development is of great benefit to agriculture and people's health. Adapting to the characteristics of China's long and tortuous coastline, the existing marine biology laboratory will be expanded into an oceanographic institute. This comprehensive discipline, including marine chemistry, marine biology, marine meteorology, and marine geology, is important for the marine products industry, shipping, and national defense.

In coordination with the development of national power resources and underground resources, the technical science department will focus on the research of mechanics and energy (hydraulic, electric, thermal) and mining. The hydraulic research laboratory jointly run with Tsinghua University is under preparation. This research institution will carry out research on problems such as sediment erosion and deposition, the layout of hydraulic hubs, and the design of hydraulic generator sets to meet the needs of fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy, as well as the Yangtze River planning.

In the social sciences, the new disciplines to be opened up include law, Asian studies, departmental economics (industrial economics and agricultural economics), and humanities (i.e., folklore), most of which will be studied in newly built research institutes.

At present, the Academy of Sciences has a total of forty-one independent research institutions, more than a quarter of which have been newly built since the start of the national First Five-Year Plan. Scientists have carried out many research works in the past few years that were not done in the old China, mainly the vast majority of disciplines in the technical science department, as well as nuclear physics, mechanics, computational mathematics, metal physics, low-temperature physics, semiconductor physics, polymer chemistry, Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity, microbiology, geobotany, plant physiology, and agricultural meteorology. In many of these aspects, research results have been obtained and have played a significant role in national construction.

Xinhua News Agency, 24th – The Executive Committee Meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held on the 22nd decided to award the first Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Prize in 1956, with a quota of twenty to thirty awards.

Scientific research reports or scientific works since the founding of the People's Republic of China, which meet the requirements of Articles 2 and 10 of the "Provisional Regulations on the Science Prize of the Chinese Academy of Sciences," may be recommended by the recommending agencies.

The recommending agencies should, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the "Provisional Regulations on the Science Prize of the Chinese Academy of Sciences," submit the recommended scientific research reports or scientific works, together with the recommendation letter, academic appraisal, and other relevant materials, to the Department of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry, the Department of Biology and Geosciences, the Department of Technical Sciences, or the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, according to the nature of the discipline.

The recommendation date is from October 1st to December 31st this year. The list of winners will be announced on May 4, 1956.

    科学院将新建十一个研究机构
    并决定明年颁发第一次科学奖金
    新华社二十五日讯　在国家第一个五年计划的今后两年多的时间中，中国科学院决定建立十一个新的研究机构和发展一些旧有的研究机构来开辟许多新的科学领域。
    世界已进入原子能时代。中国将要大力开展和平利用原子能的研究。在我们新中国自己的实验室里，将要出现苏联帮助建立的原子反应堆和粒子加速器；其他各门科学中也将广泛应用示踪原子和各种放射性物质来进行研究。物理化学方面还要建立不少重要的学科，例如：空气动力学，是航空事业所不可缺少的一门科学；塑性力学关系着金属锻压、轧钢和机器制造技术的改进；无机化学方面物理化学分析的研究对合金制造和大规模的肥料生产等都有很大需要，稀有元素和同位素化学的研究更有着广阔的用途；有机化学方面重有机合成的研究是解决有机化学工业原料的基本途径。
    生物学地学部将要开展米丘林遗传学的理论研究，它对于在遗传学中根除资产阶级反动学术思想和树立辩证唯物主义的研究方法，正确地理解环境同有机体的统一以及有机体的定向培育，以便根据客观规律改造生物改造自然，都有决定性的意义。原有的生物学研究机构要发展生物物理学的研究。这是研究电生理学、示踪原子在生物方面的应用和各种射线对生命现象的影响的一门年青的学科。它的发展对于农业和人民保健都有很大益处。适应中国海洋线漫长曲折的特点，原有的海洋生物研究室将扩建成一个海洋学研究所。这门包括海洋化学、海洋生物学、海洋气象学和海洋地质学的综合性学科同海产事业、航运和国防都有重要关系。
    配合国家动力资源和地下资源的开发，技术科学部门将着重开展力能学（水力、电力、热力）和采矿学的研究。和清华大学合办的水利研究室正在筹建中，这个研究机构将开展关于泥砂冲刷沉积、水力枢纽的布置、水力发电机组的设计等问题的研究，以适应根治黄河水患和开发黄河水利以及长江规划的需要。
    社会科学方面，决定开辟的新学科有法律学、亚洲问题、部门经济学（工业经济学和农业经济学）和人文学（即民俗学）等，其中大部分要新建研究所来进行研究。
    目前科学院共四十一个独立研究机构，其中四分之一以上是从国家第一个五年计划开始以来新建的。科学家们在以往几年中已进行了许多旧中国没有做过的研究工作，主要的是技术科学部门的极大部分学科以及原子核物理、力学、计算数学、金属物理、低温物理、半导体物理、高分子化学、巴甫洛夫高级神经活动学说、微生物学、地植物学、植物生理学和农业气象学。其中不少方面已获得了研究成果，并在国家建设中起了重大作用。
    新华社二十四日讯　中国科学院二十二日举行的院务常务会议决定在一九五六年内颁发第一次中国科学院科学奖金，奖励名额是二十名到三十名。
    自中华人民共和国建国以来的科学研究工作报告或科学著作，凡符合“中国科学院科学奖金暂行条例”第二条和第十条规定的，都可由推荐机关推荐。
    负责推荐的机关应根据“中国科学院科学奖金暂行条例”第六条的规定，将被推荐的科学研究工作报告或科学著作连同推荐书、学术鉴定和其他有关材料，按学科性质分别送交中国科学院物理学数学化学部、生物学地学部、技术科学部或哲学社会科学部。
    推荐日期自今年十月一日起到十二月三十一日截止。一九五六年五月四日公布得奖名单。
