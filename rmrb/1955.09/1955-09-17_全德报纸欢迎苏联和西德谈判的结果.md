Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 15th: Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic widely reported on the results of the negotiations between the delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in Moscow.

    "Neues Deutschland" highlighted in a dispatch from Moscow that the negotiations between the delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany had yielded good results, marking a victory for the policy of negotiation over the policy of "strength." The newspaper wrote that the Moscow talks concluded with a great victory for Soviet policy.

    "National-Zeitung," the organ of the National Democratic Party, wrote in a commentary that the Moscow negotiations showed the West German public more clearly than before that German unification could only be achieved through easing tensions and ensuring European security after the ratification of the Paris Agreements. The newspaper continued that the purpose of the Moscow negotiations had been achieved. It can now be affirmed to the world that friendship with the Soviet Union will promote the resolution of the German question. This is the basis of our government's policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: West German newspapers prominently displayed the news of the conclusion of negotiations between the delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in Moscow with large headlines.

    "Der Tagesspiegel" published a report from its Moscow correspondent in the "Our Opinion" column, saying that the establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of ambassadors between the Soviet Union and West Germany became possible because the Federal Chancellor agreed with the Soviet government's view that diplomatic relations should only be the beginning of a normalization process, not the end.

    "Die Zeit" weekly expressed its support for Adenauer's trip to Moscow and the negotiations held, believing that the two countries had to rely on their mutual relations in many aspects. However, until now, there had been no relations between them at all, not even mutual understanding. Now, the situation has changed. Genuine scenes that everyone can see have emerged.

    "Express" wrote that one cannot fail to notice "the tremendous change in this atmosphere, which is the result of the Moscow trip and the possibility of future negotiations by special envoys." However, the newspaper insisted that there seemed to be some "unclear points" in the letters exchanged between Bulganin and Adenauer, and expressed concern that these "unclear points" would later lead to different interpretations.

    全德报纸欢迎苏联和西德谈判的结果
    据新华社讯  据塔斯社柏林十五日讯：德意志民主共和国的报纸普遍报道了苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团在莫斯科的谈判结果。
    “新德意志报”在从莫斯科发出的消息中着重指出，苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团之间的谈判带来了良好的结果，这标志着协商政策对“实力地位”政策的胜利。这家报纸写道，莫斯科谈判以苏联政策的巨大胜利而结束。
    国家民主党机关报“国民日报”在评论中写道，莫斯科谈判比以前更为明确地向西德公众表明，在巴黎协定批准之后，只有通过缓和紧张局势和保障欧洲安全的道路才能达到德国的统一。这家报纸接着写道，莫斯科谈判的目的已经达到了。现在可以向全世界肯定地说，同苏联友好会促使德国问题得到解决。这是我国政府的政策的基础。
    据新华社讯  据塔斯社柏林讯：西德各报都以显著地位大字标题刊载关于苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团在莫斯科举行的谈判结束的消息。
    “每日镜报”在“我们的意见”一栏中刊载了报纸驻莫斯科记者的报道说，苏联同西德建立外交关系和互派大使所以成为可能，是因为联邦总理同意了苏联政府的看法，即外交关系应当只是正常化过程中的开端，而不是结束。
    “时代”周刊表示拥护阿登纳的莫斯科之行和所举行的谈判，认为两国在许多方面要依靠它们的相互关系。但到目前为止，它们之间根本就没有任何关系，甚至相互之间毫无了解。现在，情况改变了。出现了大家都看到的真挚的场面。
    “快报”写道，不能不注意到“这种气氛的巨大改变，这种改变是莫斯科之行以及未来特命大使谈判的可能性的结果”。但是报纸硬说，在布尔加宁同阿登纳交换的信中似乎有些“不明确的地方”，并且表示担心说，这种“不明确的地方”以后会引起不同的解释。
