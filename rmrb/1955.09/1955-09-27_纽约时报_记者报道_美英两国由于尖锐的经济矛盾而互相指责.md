Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: “New York Times” reporter Felix Belair recently reported in a dispatch from Washington that the United States and Britain are blaming each other due to sharp economic contradictions. The dispatch stated, "Economic relations between the United States and Britain are rapidly approaching a crisis stage."

The dispatch first discussed the conflict of interests between the United States and Britain on foreign trade issues and Britain's dissatisfaction with the US's restrictions and discriminatory policies. The message pointed out that the US government recently raised the import tax on bicycles, refused to let a British company undertake the equipment supply contract for a large hydropower station, and also announced that it would stipulate import quotas for oil. These measures particularly annoyed Britain. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler recently made a direct accusation against the United States' foreign trade policy at the tenth annual meeting of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund. Butler said that in recent weeks, there have been "many signs of regression" in the US trade policy, and if this situation continues to develop, it will only lead to painful reassessment.

However, the US side not only ignored Britain's accusations but also believed that Britain's economic difficulties were self-inflicted. Belair said that in the eyes of Washington officials, Britain's difficulties are mainly due to "Britain consuming far more than it should." They believe that even without any "regressive" measures by the United States, Britain's economic difficulties would be equally serious.

The differences between Britain and the United States on the issue of currency convertibility are also very obvious. Due to the sharp decline in Britain's gold and dollar reserves, the British government has completely dismissed the issue of currency convertibility, which the United States has always advocated.

Belair pointed out that Britain also does not welcome the US's repeated emphasis on expanding US private capital investment abroad. Britain believes that the investment policy currently being implemented by the United States is "an unrealistic policy." Currently, in terms of foreign investment, the United States has already gained an overwhelming advantage over Britain. This situation puts Britain at a disadvantage. According to the figures cited by Belair, in 1954, the profit from US investment income in the sterling area reached 477.7 million US dollars, while the profit from British investment in the dollar area (mainly in the United States and Canada) in the same period was only 155.5 million US dollars, resulting in an annual deficit of 322.2 million US dollars.

### “纽约时报”记者报道  美英两国由于尖锐的经济矛盾而互相指责

    美英两国由于尖锐的经济矛盾而互相指责
    新华社二十六日讯　“纽约时报”记者费利克斯·伯莱尔最近在一条从华盛顿发出的消息中，报道了美国和英国由于尖锐的经济矛盾而相互指责的情况。这条消息说：“美国和英国的经济关系正在迅速临近一个危机阶段”。
    这条消息首先谈到美国和英国之间在对外贸易问题上的利害冲突和英国对美国的限制和歧视政策的不满。消息指出，美国政府最近提高了自行车的入口税，拒绝了让英国公司承揽一个大型水电站的设备供应合同，并且还宣布要规定石油的入口限额。这些措施特别使英国感到恼怒。英国财政大臣巴特勒最近在国际复兴开发银行和国际货币基金组织第十届年会上对美国的对外贸易政策提出正面的指责，巴特勒说，在最近几个星期，美国的贸易政策“有许多倒退的迹象，这种情况进一步发展下去，只有导致痛苦的重新估计”。
    但是美国方面不但不理会英国的指责，反而认为英国的经济困难是自作自受。伯莱尔说，在华盛顿官员们看来，英国的困难主要是由于“英国的消费远远超过它应该消费的数量”。他们认为即使没有任何美国的“倒退”措施，英国的经济困难也会同样严重。
    在货币自由兑换问题上，英国和美国的分歧也十分明显。由于英国黄金美元储备的急剧减少，英国政府对美国一直主张的货币自由兑换问题根本不予考虑。
    伯莱尔指出，英国同样也不欢迎美国一再强调的扩大美国私人资本在国外的投资的主张。英国认为美国正在执行的投资政策是“一种不现实的政策”。目前在国外投资方面，美国已经取得了对英国的压倒优势。这种情况使英国蒙受不利。根据伯莱尔引用的数字，在一九五四年，美国在英镑区的投资收入的利得达到四亿七千七百万美元，而同期英国在美元区的投资（主要在美国和加拿大）的利得却只有一亿五千五百万美元，一年的逆差达到三亿二千二百万美元。
