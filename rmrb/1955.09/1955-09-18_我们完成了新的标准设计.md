    We Have Completed the New Standard Design
    Yan Zixiang
    Recently, we—the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction—completed the design for six types of civil buildings, including apartment buildings for families, single dormitories, offices, and single-story residences, dormitories, and offices, based on the non-productive construction cost targets proposed by the Central Committee. For each type, different design plans were formulated according to the different climates of areas north of Changchun, South Manchuria and the Yellow River basin, and Central and Southern China and the Yangtze River basin. In cold regions, attention was paid to heating and increasing the thickness and depth of walls; in hot regions, attention was paid to solving cross-ventilation and heat prevention issues. In the design of each of the above-mentioned regions, different supplementary technical measures were taken according to different locations and urban climates. For example, compared to Beijing, the cold-proofing requirements in Shenyang are higher, while the ventilation requirements in Luoyang and Xi'an need to be better. At the same time, various plans have centralized heating and stove heating, and no heating equipment depending on different usage requirements. Therefore, the standard design scheme actually has more than twenty kinds.
    This standard design has met the Central Committee's requirements for saving investment. For example, the average cost per square meter for apartment buildings in North China is between 45 and 55 yuan, while the cost for single-story buildings is between 25 and 35 yuan. In colder regions of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, double-layered windows, exterior walls thicker than two bricks, and deeper frost-resistant foundations are required, and the cost considered in the preliminary design stage is 10% higher than in general areas, and may exceed the state-stipulated cost control. However, in the design process, a series of cost-reducing measures were adopted, and local materials were used reasonably, so that the cost was still controlled within the numbers stipulated by the state. The standard design in other regions is lower than the cost stipulated by the state. Compared with general civil buildings in the first half of the year, the cost of this standard design has been reduced by 30% to 50%, and the effective area has also been increased to more than 60% of the building area on average.
    The reason for the cost reduction of this standard design is that we have corrected the idea of adopting excessively high standards for non-productive buildings. For example, single-story building designs in North China do not use central heating, but have been changed to stoves or heated brick beds; some apartment building residences have also been changed to stove heating; offices and collective dormitories that must use central heating have also reduced the heating temperature from the Soviet standard of 18 degrees to the 16 degrees we are currently accustomed to. In addition, with the simplification of the pipeline system, the heating equipment cost per square meter has been reduced from 7-8 yuan to 3-4.5 yuan; in terms of electrical lighting, the use of light bulbs with smaller wattages, open wires instead of concealed wires, reduction of electrical outlets, and more pull-line switches have reduced the electricity cost per square meter from 1.9 yuan to 0.7-0.8 yuan; in addition, lowering the height of the rooms, thinning the walls, simplifying the roof, reducing small hardware, and using shared or centralized water supply and toilets to reduce pipelines have also greatly reduced the cost. For example, the apartment building design in the Northeast region, in addition to taking various cost-reducing measures, also used one-and-a-half brick thick cavity walls instead of the past two-brick or thicker exterior walls, which not only saved bricks but also reduced costs and had the same cold-proofing effect. In addition, a large number of local materials—sorghum stalks—were reasonably used to make interior partitions and ceiling skeletons, which guaranteed that the design in the Northeast region did not exceed the state-stipulated cost control under certain engineering quality.
    Because investment has been saved, when calculating rent based on cost depreciation, a household living in the same area can pay 35% to 50% less rent. This is also very suitable for the economic conditions of ordinary workers.
    In addition to reducing costs, we have also maximized consideration of various requirements in daily use. For example, in the design of dormitories and residences, we try to make the main rooms face good directions and put small rooms and secondary rooms, such as toilets, kitchens, and stairwells, in the back. Type B staff residences are mainly one room per household, and some are two rooms per household. The large rooms are about 15 square meters, suitable for a family of three or four people. The individual small rooms are about 10 square meters, for a family of two or three people. In the design of single-story buildings, each household uses a kitchen independently or two households share one kitchen, while in apartment buildings, most of them are shared by two households, and individual cases do not exceed three households. In this way, building area and water supply and drainage and chimneys can be saved at present; in the future, when the living standards of employees improve, each household will need to live in two rooms, and each household can use a kitchen independently. The height of the room is the lowest at 2.8 meters and the highest at 3.2 meters according to ventilation needs. And according to different usage requirements, offices and single dormitories are designed to be higher than residences; hot places are higher than cold places, and apartment buildings are higher than single-story buildings.
    In addition, some necessary equipment, such as laundry sinks in kitchens, toilets in women's collective dormitories, verandas in front of single-story buildings, and collective shared tap water and toilets, etc., although they will increase some costs, are still provided.
    The houses designed according to the above standard designs are still better to use than the current living conditions of ordinary workers, urban residents, and ordinary cadres. However, a type of residence mainly for general industrial and mining workers cannot meet the needs of various types of cadres. Therefore, in August, a higher-level type A residence was quickly designed. Each household can live in a complete unit of three or four rooms, and the standards of water, electricity, heating, and sanitary equipment have also been improved. This is for construction units to choose for cadres with better living needs and higher incomes. In terms of the construction quality of the above types of designs, apartment buildings can be guaranteed to be used for 50 to 80 years, the cheapest single-story buildings can be guaranteed to be used for 10 to 15 years, and brick-wood structures can be used for 20 to 40 years.
    Building materials generally account for 70% of the total construction cost. Therefore, reducing the cost of construction largely depends on the price and supply of building materials. If the cost of materials such as reinforced concrete and sanitary lighting equipment used in apartment building design can be reduced, it can not only reduce the cost of construction but also improve the quality. Secondly, in the design of various types of single-story buildings, we have universally adopted local materials such as adobe, reed mats, bamboo, willow branches, bluestone ash, and sorghum stalks, which greatly reduced the "estimated" cost. However, whether these materials can be obtained in large quantities locally at one time is still a problem. If they are to be transported from other places, the cost will be higher. Moreover, some materials are not available for production at every construction site, such as adobe, sandy soil, and low-lying areas. At the same time, these materials must be processed and prepared for a certain period of time. For example, adobe bricks need to be made and dried, and bamboo chips, sorghum stalks, and willow branches need to be treated for insect and moth prevention, which may not meet the requirements for urgently starting construction. In addition, most construction sites have already transported large quantities of bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel, and adobe workers and bamboo workers are temporarily lacking, and there are problems in terms of materials and new job training. Therefore, most of our single-story building designs have done preliminary designs, determined quality indicators and cost control, and made some individual schematic designs. When using them in various places, they should also be modified and supplemented according to the principle of "adapting to local conditions and using local materials." As for apartment building design, we mainly still use the materials that have been widely prepared so that we can use existing materials and types of work to start construction immediately and avoid delaying construction and causing new waste.
    This standard design also has many shortcomings. First of all, there are too few types of designs, which cannot be adapted to various different conditions and terrains. At the same time, there is only cast-in-place but no prefabricated ones, and there is only one type with three layers. The shape and elevation are also very monotonous, and the aesthetic requirements cannot be properly taken into account in the arrangement. Secondly, due to the short time limit for compilation, there are still some considerations that are not well thought out regarding the applicability of the residence and some technical measures. Although we made some revisions and supplements during the work, we still cannot meet the requirements. At the same time, this time we only made individual designs and did not do group layout designs that cooperate with urban planning, as well as the design of public facilities such as outdoor roads, water supply and drainage, and boiler rooms, which will also cause certain difficulties in use. We plan to solve these problems gradually in future work.
    Finally, it needs to be pointed out that recently we have found that some comrades in design units and construction units have a bias. They believe that houses with low design and construction standards do not require any technology. Some comrades even neglect quality, safety, and applicability under the pretext of saving money. Individually, there are also cases where standard drawings are used for construction without conducting basic surveys. We believe that making the most of local materials is indeed an important condition for saving money in the future; however, if the performance and conditions of use of materials and different geological conditions and corresponding construction methods are not taken into account, quality accidents will inevitably occur. We hope that all localities will pay special attention to this point when applying and modifying this standard design according to local conditions.

    我们完成了新的标准设计
    阎子祥
    最近，我们——建筑工程部设计总局根据中央提出的非生产性建筑造价指标，完成了楼房的家属住宅、单身宿舍、办公室和平房的住宅、宿舍、办公室等六类民用建筑的设计。每类又按照长春以北、南满及黄河流域、中南及长江流域的不同气候，拟定了不同的设计方案。在寒冷的地区，注意采暖和增加墙的厚度和深度；在热的地方，注意解决穿堂风和防热问题。在以上每类地区的设计中，又按不同地段和城市气候的不同，作了不同的补充技术措施。如同北京比较，沈阳的防寒条件就要高一些，而洛阳、西安的通风条件则需要好一些。同时，各种方案又由于使用要求的不同，有集中用暖汽采暖的，有用火炉采暖的，有没有采暖设备的。因此，这次标准设计的方案实际上共有二十多种。
    这次的标准设计达到了中央对于节约投资的要求。例如华北地区的楼房设计，每平方公尺的平均造价在四十五元到五十五元之间，平房在二十五元到三十五元之间。在东北和内蒙古较寒冷的地区，需要双层窗、两砖以上厚度的外墙，比较深的防冻基础等，而在初步设计阶段考虑造价要比一般地区高百分之十，并可能超出国家规定的控制造价，但在设计编制过程中，由于采取了一系列降低造价的措施，并合理采用地方材料，使造价仍然控制在国家规定的数字内，其他地区的标准设计都比国家规定的造价要低。同上半年一般的民用建筑比较，这次标准设计的造价则降低了百分之三十到五十，有效面积平均也提高到占建筑面积的百分之六十以上。
    这次标准设计的造价降低的原因，是我们纠正了对非生产性建筑采用过高标准的思想，例如：华北地区的平房设计不用暖汽，改成了火炉或火炕；有的楼房住宅也改用火炉采暖；办公楼和集体宿舍必须集中用暖汽采暖的，也把采暖的温度从苏联的标准十八度减低到我国目前已经习惯的十六度，加上管道系统的简化，每平方公尺的采暖设备费用就从七至八元降低到了三元至四元半；在电气照明方面，使用度数比较小的灯泡、用明线代暗线、减少电插头、多用拉线开关等，使每平方公尺的电照费从一元九角降低到了七、八角；此外，把房间的高度降低，墙壁改薄，屋顶改简单一些，减少小五金，自来水及厕所采取合用或集中使用以减少管道，也大大降低了造价。又如东北区的楼房设计，除采取了各项降低造价的措施外，还用一砖半厚的空隙外墙代替过去的两砖以上厚度的外墙，既节省了砖，又降低了造价，并且有同样的防寒效果，此外还大量地合理利用地方材料——高粱杆，做内隔墙和天棚骨架，这些都保证了东北地区的设计在一定的工程质量下没有超出国家规定的控制造价。
    由于节省了投资，按成本折旧来计算房租时，一个住户住同样的面积，就可以少缴百分之三十五到五十的房租。这对于普通职工的经济条件也是很合适的。
    除了降低造价以外，我们也最大限度地考虑了日常使用上的各种要求。例如：在宿舍和住宅的设计中，尽量使主要房间朝着好的方向，把小房间和次要房间，如厕所、厨房、楼梯间等，放在后面。乙种职工住宅以每户一个房间为主，个别的是每户两个房间。大房间有十五平方公尺左右，以适合三四口人一家之用。个别小房间是十平方公尺左右，供两三口人一家之用。在平房的设计中，每户独用或两户合用一个厨房，在楼房中则大部是两户合用，个别的也不超过三户合用。这样，在目前可以节省建筑面积和上下水道、烟囱；将来职工生活提高以后，每户需要住两间房子时，各家就都可以独用一个厨房了。房间的高度根据通风的需要，最低的是二点八公尺，最高的是三点二公尺。并且根据不同的使用要求，把办公室和单身宿舍设计得比住宅高；热的地方比冷的地方高，楼房比平房高。
    此外，有些必要的设备，如厨房里的洗濯斗、妇女集体宿舍中的卫生间、平房前面的廊沿、以及集体合用的自来水和厕所等，虽然要增加一些造价，也仍然设置了。
    根据上面这些标准设计出来的房屋，使用起来仍比目前一般工人、城市居民和普通干部的居住条件要好。但是以一般工矿职工为主要对象的一类住宅，终究是不能适应各类干部使用的需要，因而在八月间又赶速设计了一种较高级的甲类住宅，每户可住用三室或四室的一个成套单元，水电暖气卫生设备标准也都有所提高，这是为了建设单位选用，以供应生活需要较好、收入较多的干部所使用。在以上各类设计的建筑质量上，楼房可以保证使用五十年到八十年，最便宜的平房可以保证使用十年到十五年，砖木结构的平房可以使用二十到四十年。
    建筑材料一般占全部建筑造价的百分之七十，因此降低建筑造价，在很大程度上是决定于建筑材料的价格和供应状况。在楼房设计中采用的钢筋水泥以及卫生电照设备等材料费用，如能有所降低，则不仅还可降低建筑造价，而且还可改进质量。其次我们在各类型的平房设计中，普遍采用了泥坯、芦箔、竹材、柳条、青灰、高粱秆等地方材料，使“概算”出来的造价大大降低了。但是这些材料是否一时就能在当地大量取得，还是问题。如果要从外地调运，造价就要高了。而且有些材料并不是各个建筑场地都有条件制作，像土坯、沙石地和洼地就不能做。同时这些材料又必须经过一定时间的加工准备。如土坯要制作、晒干，竹片、高粱秆、柳条要经过除虫和防蛀处理，这样就可能赶不上目前急需开工的要求。再加目前大部工地都已运到了大批的砖瓦砂石，土坯工和竹工一时也缺乏，在材料和新工种训练上都有问题。因此，我们这次设计的平房，多数是做了初步设计，确定了质量指标和控制造价，并做了些个别的示意图设计。各地使用时，还要根据“因地制宜、就地取材”的原则，加以修改补充。至于楼房设计，我们主要地仍采用了目前已普遍准备的材料，以便利用已有的材料和工种，立即开工，避免延误工期和造成新的浪费。
    这次的标准设计也还有不少缺点。首先是设计的类型较少，不能适应各种不同条件和地形的使用，同时仅有捣制的而无预制的，层次也只有三层的一种，体型立面又很单调，在布置上不能适当照顾美观要求。其次由于编制时，限于短促，对于居住的适用及部分技术措施，还有考虑不周的地方。虽然我们在工作进行中间曾作了一些修正和补充，还不能达到应有的要求，同时，这次只做了个体设计而没有做配合城市规划的群体布置设计，以及室外的道路、上下水道、锅炉房等公用设施的设计，也将在使用中产生一定的困难，这些问题我们准备在今后的工作中逐步解决。
    最后需要提出的是，近来我们发现有一些设计单位和施工单位的同志，产生了一种偏向。他们认为设计和建筑标准不高的房子，不需要什么技术。有的同志甚至借口节约，忽视了质量、安全和适用。个别还有搬用标准图即行施工，而不进行基础勘察的情况。我们认为，尽量利用地方材料，确是今后节约的重要条件；但是如果不考虑到材料的性能和使用条件以及不同的地质和相应的施工方法，必然会造成质量事故。我们希望各地根据当地情况应用和修改这次的标准设计时，特别要警惕这一点。
