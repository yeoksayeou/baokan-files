Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 15th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 14th, Phạm Văn Đồng, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter on August 17th to Eden and Molotov, the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. In the letter, Phạm Văn Đồng detailed the grave situation threatening the political resolution of the Vietnam issue and stated the position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this situation.

In the letter, Phạm Văn Đồng said that the Geneva Accords had clearly stipulated the measures that should be taken to cease hostilities and resolve political issues in order to restore and consolidate peace in Indochina.

Phạm Văn Đồng said that in the initial 300 days of the implementation of the armistice agreement, good results had been achieved due to the efforts of the parties concerned, thereby forming the necessary prerequisite for the realization of a political solution to the Vietnam issue.

The letter described the statements and notes of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 6th and July 19th to the South Vietnamese authorities regarding the holding of consultative conferences for the settlement of the Vietnam political issues. The letter emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities had repeatedly denied the Geneva Accords and refused to convene consultative conferences to discuss holding free general elections. The letter pointed out that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that due to this attitude of the South Vietnamese authorities, the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the realization of a political solution to the Vietnam issue are seriously threatened. The consultative conference, which should have been convened on July 20th, has not been convened to date. This is a grave situation for the consolidation of peace and the realization of Vietnam's reunification, and it is also a situation that exacerbates tensions in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The letter continued that, therefore, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote this letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to state its attitude and request the two chairmen to intervene.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the political problem of Vietnam should be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, that is, consultative conferences should be held by the representative responsible authorities of both regions to discuss the holding of free general elections to achieve the unification of Vietnam, thereby consolidating peace in Vietnam and Indochina and promoting world peace.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the French government and the South Vietnamese government should fulfill their obligations regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords on the cessation of hostilities and the realization of a political solution.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take all necessary measures to ensure respect for the Geneva Accords, resolve the political issue of Vietnam, and immediately convene consultative conferences between the representative responsible authorities of the Northern and Southern regions to discuss the holding of national general elections to achieve the unification of Vietnam.

This is not only in the interests and wishes of the entire Vietnamese people, but also the wish of all peace-loving people in the world.

    就威胁着越南政治问题解决的严重局势
    范文同致函艾登和莫洛托夫
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南通讯社十四日讯：越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在八月十七日写了一封信给日内瓦会议的两位主席艾登和莫洛托夫。范文同在信中详细说明了威胁着越南政治问题解决的严重局势，并且表明了越南民主共和国政府对这一局势的立场。
    范文同在信中说，日内瓦协议已经明确地规定了为了停止敌对行动和解决政治问题以便恢复和巩固印度支那的和平所应该采取的措施。
    范文同说，在停战协定执行的最初三百天中，由于有关方面的努力，已经得到良好的结果，从而形成了实现越南政治问题解决的必要前提。
    信中叙述了越南民主共和国政府为了越南政治问题的解决在六月六日发表的和在七月十九日给越南南方当局的关于举行协商会议的声明和照会。信中着重提到了越南南方当局一再否认日内瓦协议并拒绝召开讨论举行自由普选的协商会议。信中指出，越南民主共和国政府认为，由于越南南方当局的这种态度，实施日内瓦协议和实现越南政治问题的解决受到了严重的威胁。应该在七月二十日召开的协商会议，到目前为止还没有召开，这对于巩固和平和实现越南的统一是一种严重的局势，同时也是一种加剧印度支那和东南亚紧张局势的情况。
    信中接着说，因此，越南民主共和国政府写这封信给日内瓦会议的两位主席，说明它的态度并且要求两位主席进行干涉。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，越南的政治问题应当按照日内瓦协议的规定加以解决，也就是说应当由双方地区的有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论举行自由普选以实现越南的统一的问题，从而巩固越南和印度支那和平和促进世界和平。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，法国政府和南越政府应当履行它们的关于执行日内瓦协议关于停止敌对行动以及实现政治解决的义务。
    越南民主共和国政府要求日内瓦会议的两位主席采取一切必要措施以保证尊重日内瓦协议，解决越南政治问题和立即召开北方地区和南方地区的有代表性的负责当局之间的协商会议，讨论举行全国普选以实现越南统一的问题。
    这不仅是全体越南人民的利益和愿望，而且也是全世界爱好和平人民的愿望。
