Rural Wired Broadcasting Stations Are Gradually Developing

On the afternoon of August 31st, the heads of radio stations and receiving work from twenty-two provinces and autonomous regions, who were participating in a symposium on rural wired broadcasting work held by the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau, departed from Beijing to visit the first rural wired broadcasting station established in the country – the Jiutai County Broadcasting Station in Jilin Province. This station was established in April 1952 and has consistently been welcomed and supported by the farmers of the entire county for more than three years. The station has now installed 788 loudspeakers in the rural areas, covering all villages in the county.

Starting with the Jiutai County Rural Broadcasting Station, wired broadcasting stations have been successively established in rural areas throughout the country. Currently, 101 rural wired broadcasting stations have been established in thirteen provinces, including Jilin, Fujian, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, and Zhejiang. These broadcasting stations broadcast for one to two hours to three to four hours every day or every other day at noon or in the evening. The programs include rebroadcasts of domestic and international current affairs news from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and provincial people's broadcasting stations, government announcements and decrees, various news items from the province and other regions, as well as cultural and artistic programs. In addition, each rural broadcasting station has its own programs closely integrated with the actual work in the local area, promptly conveying and publicizing the central tasks, explaining various policies, introducing agricultural production models, imparting advanced production experiences, and forecasting weather conditions. Some stations also translate important spoken-word broadcasts from the Central People's Broadcasting Station into local dialects for rebroadcasting. The Shunchang County Rural Wired Broadcasting Station in Fujian Province has a 15-minute self-produced program in each broadcast, helping farmers solve various problems at any time. This spring, when promoting grain conservation, the broadcasting station staff learned that local farmers were accustomed to feeding pigs with rice. They invited a local pig-raising expert to talk about his own experience of feeding pigs with pumpkins. Then, they invited staff from the Shunchang County Agricultural Technology Guidance Station to talk about how to grow pumpkins, effectively helping local farmers solve the problem of pig feed and saving a lot of grain. In June, when the semester was about to end, the broadcasting station invited a young man who participated in agricultural production after graduating from local senior primary school to talk about his progress after participating in production, conducting a labor education for primary school students who were about to graduate.

    农村有线广播站正逐步发展
    八月三十一日下午，参加广播事业局召开的农村有线广播工作座谈会的二十二个省和自治区的广播电台收音工作负责人从北京出发，到吉林省去参观全国最先建立的一座农村有线广播站——九台县广播站。这个站是在一九五二年四月建立的，三年多来一贯得到全县农民的欢迎和支持。现在这个站已在农村中安装了七百八十八个喇叭，普遍到全县所有的村子。
    从九台县农村广播站开始，各地农村中陆续建设起有线广播站。现在吉林、福建、四川、黑龙江、浙江等十三个省里已设立了一百零一个农村有线广播站。这些广播站每天或者隔一天在中午或晚间进行一、二小时到三、四小时的广播。节目包括转播中央人民广播电台和各省人民广播电台的国内、外时事新闻，政府公告、法令，本省和各地的各种消息以及文艺节目。另外，各农村广播站还有密切结合当地实际工作的自办节目，及时地传达和宣传当地的中心工作，讲解各项政策，介绍农业生产模范，传授先进生产经验和预报气候等。有些站还把中央人民广播电台重要的口语广播节目翻译成当地方言重播。福建省顺昌县农村有线广播站每次广播中都有十五分钟自办的节目，随时帮助农民解决各项问题。今年春天宣传节约粮食时，广播站工作人员知道当地农民习惯用大米喂猪，就请了本地一位养猪能手来讲他自己用南瓜喂猪的经验。接着，又请顺昌县农业技术指导站工作人员来讲种南瓜的方法，有效地帮助当地农民解决了养猪的饲料问题，节约了很多粮食。六月间，学期快结束的时候，广播站请了当地一个高小毕业后参加农业生产的青年来讲介绍他自己参加生产后的进步情形，对将要毕业的小学生进行了一次劳动教育。（据新华社讯）
