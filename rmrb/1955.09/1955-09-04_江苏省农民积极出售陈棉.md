Jiangsu Farmers Actively Sell Old Cotton

Since August, cotton farmers in Jiangsu Province have been selling more and more old cotton. The amount of cotton sold from August 1st to 9th increased more than four times compared to the same period in July. As of August 21st, farmers in the cotton-growing areas of the province had sold more than 1,987,000 jin of old cotton to the state.

Cooperative supply and marketing agencies in various cotton-growing areas have criticized the erroneous thinking that neglects the purchase of scattered old cotton and have actively strengthened the work of purchasing old cotton. In Haian County, in addition to strengthening the original four cotton purchasing points and restoring the six cotton purchasing points that had been revoked, 32 mobile purchasing teams were organized to go to the countryside to conduct mobile purchases, combined with the supply of production materials. In Qidong County, the 23 cotton purchasing points adopted the method of purchasing at the market in the morning and going to the countryside for purchasing in the afternoon. After education, the cotton farmers in various places understood the principle of patriotic cotton sales. This year, the cotton is growing very well, and it will soon be harvested, so the cotton farmers are selling more and more old cotton. Cai Fucheng, a 73-year-old farmer from Tian'gang Township, Rudong County, sold 20.5 jin of "longevity cotton" that he had accumulated to the state. Under his influence, the farmers in the whole village sold 249 jin of seed cotton and 49 jin of lint cotton to the state in one day. In the first ten days of July, cotton farmers in the Yancheng area only sold more than 20,000 jin, while in the first ten days of August, they sold more than 210,000 jin of old cotton to the state.

    江苏省农民积极出售陈棉
    八月份以来。江苏省棉农出卖的陈棉越来越多，八月一日到九日卖的棉花比七月份同期增加四倍多。到八月二十一日为止，全省各棉区农民已把一百九十八万七千多斤陈棉卖给国家。
    各棉区供销合作社批判了不重视收购零星陈棉的错误思想，积极加强陈棉收购工作。海安县除加强原有四个收棉点，恢复已撤销的六个收棉点外，还组织了三十二个流动收购组下乡巡回收购，结合供应生产资料。启东县二十三个收棉点，采取上午门市收购，下午下乡收购的办法。各地棉农经过教育后，懂得了爱国售棉的道理，今年棉花又长得很好，不久就要收摘，因此棉农出售的陈棉越来越多。如东县甜港乡七十三岁的老农民蔡甫成，把积存的二十斤半“寿棉”卖给了国家。在他影响下，全村农民在一天中就把二百四十九斤籽棉，四十九斤皮棉卖给了国家。盐城专区棉农七月上旬只卖了两万多斤，而八月上旬就卖给国家二十一万多斤陈棉。　（本报驻南京记者）
