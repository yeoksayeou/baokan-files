Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 5th: The reconstructed German State Opera House grandly reopened in Berlin at 11:00 AM on the 4th. This opera house, with over two hundred years of history, was destroyed during World War II.

Attending the opening ceremony were Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic; Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber; Deputy Prime Ministers Ulbricht, Stoph, Nuschke, and Bolz; Politburo members of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, Matern and Central Committee Secretary Wandel, as well as other responsible persons from the government and the party. They were warmly welcomed with enthusiastic applause from the masses as they appeared at the opera house.

The presence of Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Germany, and figures from West German cultural and artistic circles was also warmly welcomed.

Also attending the opening ceremony were diplomatic envoys from various countries and outstanding dramatists and composers from the Soviet Union, China, the People's Democratic countries, and many other countries who were invited by the Ministry of Culture of the German Democratic Republic to participate in the ceremony. More than 1,500 people from the cultural and artistic circles of the German Democratic Republic, national prize winners, labor heroes, and representatives of the workers who built the theater also attended the opening ceremony.

Minister of Culture of the German Democratic Republic, Johannes R. Becher, spoke at the meeting. He said that the reconstruction of the German State Opera House is a major event of pan-German significance. It demonstrates to all of Germany the possibility of promoting national culture and lays the foundation for creating a German national opera. Becher said that the reconstruction of the opera house requires the performance of new national operas. He called on artists from East and West Germany to work together to create artistic works with patriotic ideas. He said that the creative cooperation of art workers from both parts of Germany in this theater will promote mutual understanding between Germans, thereby contributing to the cause of peacefully restoring German unity.

After Becher's speech, acting Mayor of Greater Berlin, Schmidt, in accordance with the ancient customs of the German nation, presented a symbolic giant key of the opera house to theater manager Max Burghardt, indicating that the theater had been officially completed.

That evening, Wagner's opera "The Mastersingers of Nuremberg" was performed at the opera house.
