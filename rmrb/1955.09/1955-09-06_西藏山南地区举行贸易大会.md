A trade conference was held in Jiangbalin, Cona, in the Shannan area of Tibet, and Damxung and other places in the northern Tibetan grasslands, starting in mid-August.

At the trade conferences in various places, the prices of tea, cloth, and other daily necessities were about 20 percent lower than last year, and the sales of local products such as wool, hides, and pulu sold by Tibetan farmers and herdsmen were better than in previous years. The CPC Heihe Sub-District Committee sent a delegation of medical personnel, veterinarians, and film projectionists to provide medical care, treat sick livestock, and show movies to the farmers and herdsmen participating in the Damxung trade conference.

At the beginning of August, many Tibetan merchants from Lhasa, Heihe, Taizhao and other places brought tea, cloth and other goods wholesaled to them by state-owned trading organizations to the places where the trade conferences were about to be held, including several hundred from Lhasa. The goods transported by these Tibetan merchants this year were about twice as much as in previous years. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西藏山南地区举行贸易大会
    西藏山南地区的江巴林、错那和藏北草原的当雄等地，从八月中旬起陆续举行了贸易大会。
    在各地贸易大会上，茶、布等日用品的价格比去年便宜了百分之二十左右，藏族农、牧民出售的羊毛、皮张、氆氇等土产品，销路都比往年好。中共黑河分工委派出包括医务人员、兽医工作者和电影放映工作者的慰问组，给参加当雄贸易大会的农牧民看病、治疗病畜和放映电影。
    八月初，拉萨、黑河、太昭等地许多藏族商人，就带着国营贸易机构批发给他们的茶、布等货物，赶到了将要举行贸易大会的地方，其中从拉萨市去的就有几百人。今年这些藏族商人运去的货物，比往年大约增加一倍。　（新华社）
