    President Pieck Writes to Chairman Voroshilov
    Requesting Early Release of Former German Prisoners of War Serving Sentences in the Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - According to TASS, Moscow: Soviet newspapers on the 16th published a letter from Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, to K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The letter was sent from Berlin on August 31st.
    The letter stated: "During the visit of the Soviet government delegation to Berlin in July 1955, the government of the German Democratic Republic raised the question of whether it would be possible to release the remaining former German prisoners of war who are serving sentences for crimes committed against the Soviet people during the war and to allow them to return to their homeland. As a result of the exchange of views, it was decided to continue considering this issue, taking due account of the wishes of the German Democratic Republic.
    I have been informed that our two governments have further exchanged views on this issue. Therefore, I believe it is timely to contact the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR—as the final resolution of this issue falls within its purview—and formally present the request of the German Democratic Republic for the early release of all former German prisoners of war serving sentences in the Soviet Union and to allow them to return home.
    Considering the fact that more than ten years have passed since the end of the war, I hope that my request will be given favorable consideration. The Soviet Union can be assured that the entire German people will welcome such a magnanimous act with deep gratitude."

    皮克总统致函伏罗希洛夫主席
    请求提前释放在苏联服刑的前德国战俘
    新华社十六日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联报纸十六日刊载了德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克致苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫的一封信。这封信是八月三十一日从柏林发出的。
    这封信说：“在苏联政府代表团一九五五年七月访问柏林期间，德意志民主共和国政府曾经提出是否能够释放余下的一部分由于在战争期间对苏联人民犯了罪而在服刑的前德国战俘和准许他们返回祖国的问题。交换意见的结果，决定适当照顾德意志民主共和国的愿望继续考虑这一问题。
    我被通知说我们两国政府已经就这一问题进一步交换了意见。因此，我认为同苏联最高苏维埃主席团——这个问题的最后解决是属于它的职权范围以内的——接洽并且正式提出德意志民主共和国请求提前释放在苏联服刑的所有前德国战俘和准许他们回家的要求是适时的。
    考虑到自从战争结束以来已经有十年多这一事实，我希望对我的要求给予有利的考虑。苏联可以相信，全体德国人民将以深切感激的心情来欢迎这样一个宽宏大量的行动。”
