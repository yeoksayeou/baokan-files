Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: Drought has occurred in some areas. Party and government leading departments at all levels have organized a large number of staff to go to the countryside to lead farmers in adopting various methods to fight drought. In Tuoketuo County, under the personal leadership of the County Party Secretary and the County Head, eight groups were organized to assist various districts in fighting drought and protecting seedlings. At present, more than 500 new wells have been drilled, more than 200 old wells have been dredged, and more than 8,000 existing wells have been used to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of autumn seedlings. Since the occurrence of drought, the Guangxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Hohhot City has been operating three waterwheels day and night, organizing more than 50 male and female members to carry water to irrigate the land at night; at the same time, it has also influenced farmers outside the cooperative to dig wells and irrigate the land, and shallowly hoe to preserve seedlings. The youth shock brigade of the Hongxing Vegetable Production Cooperative and the surrounding individual farmers have joined forces to repair canals and dig springs along the river, raising the water level by more than an inch, which can irrigate more than 30 mu of land per day.

    内蒙古农民积极抗旱保秋
    内蒙古自治区部分地区发生干旱现象，各级党政领导部门组织大批工作人员下乡，领导农民采用各种办法进行抗旱斗争。托克托县在县委书记和县长亲自率领下，组织了八个组分到各区协助抗旱保苗。目前全县已打新井五百多眼，掏旧井二百多个，利用原有水井八千多眼，浇过秋苗一万多亩。呼和浩特市郊区光星农业生产合作社自发生旱灾以来，就日夜不停地开动三辆水车，组织五十多位男女社员夜间担水浇地；同时还影响了社外农民也急忙挖井浇地，浅锄保苗。红星蔬菜生产合作社的青年突击队和周围单干农民联合起来整修水渠，沿河挖泉，使水位上涨一寸多高，每天可多浇地三十多亩。
