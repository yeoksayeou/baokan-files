Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China held a film reception on the evening of the 8th to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria, showing the Bulgarian feature film "Heroes of September" to people from all walks of life in the capital.

The film "Heroes of September" won the "Award for the Struggle for Freedom" at the 8th Czechoslovak International Film Festival in 1954. It depicts the revolutionary struggle of the Bulgarian workers and peasants, under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution and under the direct leadership of the outstanding revolutionary leader Dimitrov, when they launched the heroic September Uprising in 1923. Although the uprising failed due to the suppression of the reactionary government, the seeds of revolution had been sown all over the country, paving a broad path for future victory.

The film portrays the heroic images of many workers and peasants in the uprising. In the revolutionary struggle, the people deeply realized the importance of the worker-peasant alliance, and only when the worker-peasant forces are firmly united can they become an invincible force.

Attending tonight's reception were Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of Culture, and other responsible persons of various ministries, film workers and other people from all walks of life in the capital, and Takov, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Bulgarian Embassy in China, and embassy staff.

    文化部举行电影招待会庆祝保加利亚解放日
    新华社八日讯中华人民共和国文化部为庆祝保加利亚解放十一周年，在八日晚举行电影招待会，放映保加利亚故事影片“九月英雄”，招待首都各界人士。
    影片“九月英雄”一九五四年曾在捷克斯洛伐克第八届国际电影节获得“为自由而斗争奖”，它描写了保加利亚工农群众在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下，在卓越的革命领袖季米特洛夫直接领导下，一九二三年发动了英勇的九月起义的革命斗争。这次起义虽然由于反动政府的镇压而失败了，但革命的种子却已在国内四处散播，为未来的胜利开辟了广阔的道路。
    影片中表现了起义的许多工人和农民的英雄形象。在革命斗争中，使人民深刻地认识到工农联盟的重要性，只有工农队伍巩固地团结起来，才能成为不可战胜的力量。
    出席今晚招待会的，有文化部副部长郑振铎和其他各部负责人、首都电影工作者及其他各界人士、保加利亚驻华大使馆临时代办塔科夫和使馆人员。
