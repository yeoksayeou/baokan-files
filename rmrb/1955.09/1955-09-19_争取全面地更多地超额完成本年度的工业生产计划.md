    Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, all employees in China's industrial production departments are constantly achieving new production improvements on the road to socialism, step by step guiding our motherland towards the great goal of industrialization.
    As of the end of June, national state-owned, local state-owned, cooperative-operated, joint state-private industrial enterprises, and private industrial enterprises had completed 101.7 percent of the total output value plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 7.8 percent over the same period last year. By the end of August, enterprises under the six industrial ministries had completed 66.8 percent of the total annual output value plan, which was 109.9 percent of the same period last year.
    The total cost of all commodity products of the six industrial ministries from January to May averaged 1.5 percent over the cost reduction plan. Savings in raw materials were achieved: In the first half of the year, the Ministry of Textile Industry saved 620,000 kilograms of raw cotton compared with the plan, which could spin more than 3,100 bales of cotton yarn. The Ministry of Light Industry saved approximately 660,000 kilograms of tobacco leaves compared with the plan, which could produce more than 11,000 cases of cigarettes. The rubber industry, the paper industry, and other raw material savings have all achieved results.
    The average labor productivity of state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises from January to May increased by 6 percent compared with the same period last year.
    The actual profit delivered by each industrial ministry completed 108.1 percent of the plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 18.9 percent over the same period last year.
    However, there are still many shortcomings in the industrial production sector, some of which are major shortcomings that deserve our serious attention and efforts to correct.
    The most prominent problem is that the national plan has not been fully completed. Taking 30 major products across the country as an example, 10 major products, such as electricity, raw coal, and crude oil, did not fulfill the national plan in the first half of the year. A small number of products, due to incomplete varieties, cannot meet the needs of national construction and people's lives. Furthermore, in terms of systems and regions, the completion of the plan is also uneven. In the enterprises of the five central industrial ministries in Liaoning Province, except for the enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Textile Industry, the enterprises under the other ministries did not even complete the output value plan in July. Of the 52 major products produced by these five industrial ministries, 25 did not complete the plan. What is particularly serious is that three coal mines, five cement plants, ten machinery and electrical plants, three chemical plants, and three non-ferrous metal mines have not completed the total output value plan and labor productivity plan for five, six, or seven consecutive months.
    The trial production plan for new products, which is of extreme importance to the realization of the first Five-Year Plan, was also not fully completed in the first half of the year. For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building only completed 79.2 percent of the trial production plan. The Ministry of Heavy Industry also did not complete the trial production plan.
    The quality of many products is very poor, and the consequence of the poor quality of some products is: large-scale stockpiling, which leads to production cuts due to excessive stockpiles, and thus the entire national plan cannot be completed. It should be emphasized that the situation of poor quality in certain heavy industrial sectors has not fundamentally changed for a long time, which has affected the construction of new enterprises. Some enterprises do not use their brains to mobilize the masses to practice strict economy, but instead adopt a one-sided and therefore wrong method of saving, which is to use the incorrect means of reducing product quality to achieve the purpose of "saving," which is actually creating new and greater waste. Accidents in production, especially in mining production, continue to occur in some enterprises, and the number of accidents in a few units has even increased.
    These are the aspects besides the achievements.
    According to the overall requirements of the Five-Year Plan, the state stipulates that this year's total industrial output value will increase by 7.7 percent compared with 1954. However, due to the poor harvest of certain technical crops in agriculture in 1954 (such as cotton and tobacco), some light industries have faced difficulties due to insufficient raw materials. Under the call of the central government to practice strict economy, various places have drastically reduced non-productive construction, temporarily causing stockpiles of building materials such as steel bars, cement, bricks, and tiles. Some major construction projects in capital construction have failed to be put into production on schedule, and the process of restructuring the products of certain enterprises has also affected the implementation of the industrial production plan. In order to take into account these objective circumstances, the state appropriately adjusted this year's industrial total output value growth target to an increase of 5.2 percent compared with the actual completion number in 1954. According to the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year, it is possible to complete and overfulfill this overall growth target with the efforts of all employees. It is expected that 100.8 percent of the new target can be completed, which is an increase of 6 percent compared with the actual completion number in 1954. Our current task is to strive to comprehensively and exceedingly overfulfill the national industrial production plan for this year.
    This year is the third year of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, and more greatly overfulfilling this year's industrial production plan is of great significance to the successful realization of the first Five-Year Plan. If we can greatly overfulfill the industrial production plan this year, then this will provide us with a more practical guarantee to double the total value of industrial production during the first Five-Year Plan, better meet the needs of national construction and people's lives, especially the needs of the vast number of farmers for industrial products that will inevitably increase after this year's bumper harvest, and further improve equipment utilization and labor productivity.
    The objective possibility of greatly overfulfilling this year's industrial production plan exists. First of all, under the encouragement of the state's first Five-Year Plan, the enthusiasm of the working masses is high, and many advanced producers who have completed their plans ahead of schedule have emerged in various places. Secondly, the vast majority of regions across the country have had a bumper harvest this year, and technical crops used as industrial raw materials are also growing well. New cotton with good quality from Jiangsu, Shandong, and other places has been put on the market in large quantities, which can continuously supply the needs of the textile industry in the future. Also, certain construction projects listed in the Five-Year Plan that have the conditions to start construction can start construction ahead of schedule. We should take various specific measures, such as increasing the production of products that have the conditions to do so based on the balance of supply, production, and sales, and strive to increase production; rapidly organize batch production of new types of products that have been successfully trial-produced and are urgently needed by the state, and increase output as much as possible; for certain products that sell well but are limited by raw materials, strive to expand raw material sources, find substitutes, and organize waste recycling; practice strict economy, rationally use raw materials, improve operating techniques, and improve output rates, etc. If the administrative leading organs of various industrial systems and Party committees at all levels can actively strengthen leadership and effectively mobilize and organize the broad masses of employees to do these tasks well, we will be able to more greatly overfulfill this year's industrial production plan in the last three or four months of this year. The key to the problem lies here.
    While increasing production, all personnel in the industrial sector must pay close attention to comprehensively completing the plan. It is necessary to ensure the completion of the national product variety plan. It is necessary to resolutely fight against the incorrect tendencies of neglecting product quality and disregarding costs, strengthen technical management and inspection systems, prevent the tendency of using the method of reducing product quality to carry out savings, ensure that product quality fully meets the requirements stipulated by the state, strictly implement the economic accounting system from top to bottom, and strive to reduce product costs below the indicators stipulated by the state.
    The fundamental reason why a part of industrial enterprises often cannot comprehensively complete the national plan is due to the backwardness of enterprise management. This is reflected in the fact that the work style and work methods of some enterprise leaders cannot meet the requirements of managing modern enterprises. They spend all day in offices and at conference tables, do not understand or do not fully understand the specific situation in the production process, do not actively take concrete steps to promote advanced experience, and are accustomed to the old production methods. Some comrades are procrastinating in their work style, and when problems occur, they cannot take prompt and effective measures to solve them, especially they have not effectively established a complete management system, or although there is a system, they cannot conscientiously implement it. For example, the most important reason why the poor quality of products in some enterprises cannot be improved for a long time is the laxity of technical management, and the operating procedures are reduced to mere formalities. The phenomenon of no one being responsible can be found in many places. And all these phenomena are related to the lack of strict work and labor discipline in enterprises. Therefore, continuously improving the management level of enterprises is still a very important task for all industrial sectors.
    To comprehensively and more greatly overfulfill the national plan, it is necessary to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees. Therefore, further developing labor competitions and mobilizing and organizing all employees to create more and better products for the country in the last quarter of this year is a common task of the Party organizations, administrations, and Youth League organizations in enterprises. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological education among the working masses, actively lead and organize the masses to improve technology, improve operating methods, improve labor organization and production organization, use advanced examples to educate the masses, eliminate backward and weak links in production, and elevate the whole to an advanced level. Every Communist Party member and Youth League member in industrial enterprises should play an exemplary role in labor competitions.
    Mobilizing and organizing all employees, pushing the labor competition to a new climax; rapidly taking various specific measures to overcome shortcomings in production, promoting advanced experience in a planned and organized manner, and further improving the management level of industrial enterprises, striving to comprehensively and more greatly overfulfill this year's national industrial production plan is the extremely glorious combat task placed in front of all personnel in the industrial sector.

### 争取全面地更多地超额完成本年度的工业生产计划

    争取全面地更多地超额完成本年度的工业生产计划
    我国工业生产部门的全体职工，在党和政府的正确领导下，在向社会主义前进的道路上，正不断地获得提高生产的新成就，一步一步地把我们的祖国引向工业化的伟大目标。
    截至六月底为止，全国国营、地方国营、合作社营、公私合营工业及私营工业已完成上半年总产值计划百分之一百零一点七，比去年同期增长百分之七点八。到八月底止，六个工业部所属企业已完成全年总产值计划的百分之六十六点八，为去年同期的百分之一百零九点九。
    六个工业部一至五月份全部商品产品总成本，平均超额百分之一点五完成降低成本计划。原材料节约获得成效：上半年纺织工业部原棉消耗量比计划规定节约了六十二万公斤，可纺棉纱三千一百多件。轻工业部烟叶消耗量比计划规定节约了六十六万公斤左右，可制烟卷一万一千多箱。橡胶工业、造纸工业等原材料节约都有成绩。
    国营、地方国营及公私合营企业一至五月份平均劳动生产率比去年同期增长了百分之六。
    各工业部实际上缴利润，完成上半年计划百分之一百零八点一，比去年同期超过百分之十八点九。
    但是在工业生产部门还有不少的缺点，有一些是重大的缺点，值得我们严重注意并努力改正。
    最突出的问题是：没有做到全面完成国家计划。如以全国三十种主要产品而论，上半年即有电力、原煤、原油等十种主要产品没有完成国家计划。少数产品，由于品种不全，不能满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。再以系统和地区来说，计划的完成也是不平衡的。在辽宁省的中央五个工业部的企业，除重工业部、纺织工业部所属企业以外，其它各部所属企业七月份连产值计划也没有完成。这五个工业部所生产的五十二种主要产品，有二十五种没有完成计划。特别严重的是其中有三个煤矿、五个水泥厂、十个机械和电机厂、三个化学厂、三个有色金属矿山，已经连续五个月、六个月或七个月没有完成总产值计划和劳动生产率计划。
    对实现第一个五年计划有极端重要意义的新产品试制计划，上半年也没有全部完成。如第一机械工业部只完成试制计划的百分之七十九点二。重工业部的试制计划也没有完成。
    许多产品质量很差，一些产品质量低劣的后果是：大量积压，由于积压过多不得不减产，因而全部不能完成国家计划。应当着重指出的是某些重工业部门质量低劣的情况长期没有基本改变，已经影响到新企业的建设。某些企业不去动脑筋发动群众厉行节约，而是采取片面的因而是错误的节约方法，这就是用降低产品质量的不正确手段，来达到“节约”的目的，实际上是在制造新的更大的浪费。某些企业特别是矿山生产中的责任事故继续发生，少数单位的事故还增多了。
    这些就是成绩以外的一面。
    根据五年计划的总要求，国家规定了今年工业的总产值比一九五四年增长百分之七点七。但是由于一九五四年农业中某些技术作物歉收（如棉花、烟叶）造成某些轻工业原料不足的困难；在中央厉行节约的号召下，各地大量削减了非生产性建筑，暂时造成钢筋、水泥、砖瓦等建筑材料的积压；基本建设中有些主要工程项目未能按期投入生产，某些企业的产品在改制的过程中，也影响了工业生产计划的执行。为了照顾到这些客观情况，国家恰当地把今年工业总产值的增长指标调整为比一九五四年实际完成数增长百分之五点二。根据上半年计划执行的情况，在全体职工的努力下，完成和超额完成这个增长的总指标是可能的，预计可以完成新指标的百分之一百点八，即比一九五四年实际完成数增长百分之六。目前我们的任务是争取全面地更多地超额完成本年度国家的工业生产计划。
    今年是执行第一个五年计划的第三年，更多地超额完成今年的工业生产计划，对完满实现第一个五年计划有很重要的意义。如果我们今年能更多地超额完成工业生产计划，那末，这就使我们在第一个五年计划中把工业生产总值提高一倍左右有了更切实的保证，就能更好地满足国家建设和人民生活的需要，特别是今年丰收以后广大农民对工业产品必然增长的需要，就能更多地提高设备利用率和劳动生产率。
    更多地超额完成今年的工业生产计划的客观可能性是存在的。首先是在国家第一个五年计划的鼓舞下，工人群众的热情是高涨的，各地已经出现了不少提前完成计划的先进生产者；其次，今年全国绝大部分地区农业丰收，作为工业原料的技术作物也生长良好，江苏、山东等地质量很好的新棉已大量上市，可以源源供应今后纺织工业的需要。还有，某些列在五年计划内有条件开工的工程项目，可以提前施工。我们应该采取各种具体措施，如在供产销平衡的基础上有条件增加生产的产品，努力提高生产；已经试制成功、国家急需的新种类产品，迅速地组织成批生产，并尽可能提高产量；某些销路很好但原料受到限制的产品，努力扩大原料来源，寻找代用品，组织废料回收；厉行节约、合理使用原材料，改进操作技术，提高出品率等等。如果各工业系统的行政领导机关和各级党委能积极地加强领导，切实地发动和组织广大职工群众做好这些工作，我们就能够在本年度最后的三、四个月内更多地超额完成今年的工业生产计划。问题的关键就在这里。
    工业部门的全体人员在增加生产的同时，必须十分注意全面完成计划。要保证完成国家规定的产品品种计划。要坚决同忽视产品质量和不计成本的不正确倾向作斗争，加强技术管理和检查制度，防止用降低产品质量的方法来进行节约的偏向，保证产品质量完全合乎国家规定的要求，并从上到下地严格经济核算制度，努力把产品成本降低到国家规定的指标以下。
    目前一部分工业企业经常不能全面地完成国家计划的根本原因，是由于企业管理的落后。这表现在某些企业领导人员的工作作风工作方法，不能适应管理现代企业的要求，他们整天生活在办公室和会议桌上，不了解或不充分了解生产过程中的具体状况，不积极采取具体步骤推广先进经验，习惯于老一套的生产方法。某些同志工作作风拖拖拉拉，问题发生了不能采取迅速有效的措施加以解决，特别是没有切实建立起一套完整的管理制度，或者虽有制度，但不能认真贯彻。例如一些企业产品质量低劣长期不能改进，最主要的原因是技术管理的松弛，操作规程流于形式。无人负责的现象在许多地方可以发现。而所有这些现象，又是同企业中没有严格的工作、劳动纪律相联系的。因此，不断地提高企业的管理水平，仍是一切工业部门一项很重要的任务。
    要全面地更多地超额完成国家计划，必须发挥广大职工群众的积极性和创造性。因此进一步开展劳动竞赛，动员和组织全体职工在今年的最后一个季度内，为国家创造更多更好的产品，是企业中党组织、行政、青年团的一项共同的任务。为此，就必须加强工人群众中的政治思想教育，积极领导和组织群众改进技术，改进操作方法，改进劳动组织和生产组织，用先进的榜样教育群众，消除生产中落后的薄弱的环节，把全体提高到先进的水平。工业企业中的每一个共产党员和青年团员，应当在劳动竞赛中起模范作用。
    把全体职工群众动员和组织起来，把劳动竞赛推向新的高潮；迅速采取各项具体措施，克服生产中的缺点，有计划有组织地推广先进经验，进一步提高工业企业的管理水平，争取全面地更多地超额完成今年国家工业生产计划，这就是摆在工业部门全体人员面前的极为光荣的战斗任务。
