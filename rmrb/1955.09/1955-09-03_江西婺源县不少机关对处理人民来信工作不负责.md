To the Editor:

    Recently, the Supervisory Office of the Shangrao Special Commissioner's Office in Jiangxi Province conducted an inspection of the handling of people's letters and visits by twelve units, including the Wuyuan County People's Committee Office, the Health Center, and the Tax Bureau. The inspection revealed that, with the exception of units such as the County Public Security Bureau and the Tax Bureau, which placed importance on this work and had relatively sound systems, most units were doing a poor job in handling people's letters. For example, five units, including the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Health Center, the Zhangcun District Office, the People's Bank, and the Chengguan Town People's Committee, had no one responsible for this work at all, resulting in serious chaos. No one knew how many letters from the people these units had received, how many had been processed, or how many had been lost. The Secretary Chief of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative indifferently told the inspectors, "Apart from a few letters from the people forwarded by the newspapers that have been processed or returned, it seems that we have only received one letter from the masses." However, after investigation, it was found that the County People's Supervision Committee and two other units alone had forwarded twenty-three letters from the people to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative for processing, of which three had been lost. Furthermore, Cheng Hualong, the Second Deputy Manager of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Business Management Department, considered one letter unimportant and tore it up and threw it into the wastepaper basket. Some staff members of the Zhangcun District Office put the people's letters in their pockets and forgot about them for a long time. Of the thirteen letters from the people forwarded to the District Office by the former County Supervision Committee, it has now been found that nine have been lost. The Chengguan Town People's Committee received eleven letters from the people, all of which had been backlogged for more than half a year without being processed. Two units, including the County Civil Affairs Section, sent seven unprocessed letters from the people to the archives for filing. Even more seriously, the County Health Center even filed three proposals from the first session of the third Chengguan Town People's Congress without processing or replying to them.

      The County People's Committee originally had three suggestion boxes, but due to lack of management, one had been washed away by floods; one had been damaged and rendered useless due to sun and wind and lack of repair; and the remaining one was not locked, and the inside of the box was covered with cobwebs. The suggestion boxes set up by three units, including the County People's Bank, were also not managed by anyone, and were only opened once every few months. When the Health Center opened the box in June of this year, they found two letters from the people that had been dropped in December of last year.

    After this inspection, the Wuyuan County People's Committee has convened a meeting of relevant personnel from the county's directly affiliated units to review the past handling of people's letters and study ways to improve it. The Shangrao Special Commissioner's Office has instructed the County People's Committee to criticize or discipline the relevant derelict personnel accordingly.

### 江西婺源县不少机关对处理人民来信工作不负责

    江西婺源县不少机关对处理人民来信工作不负责任编辑同志：
    最近江西省上饶专署监察处对婺源县人民委员会办公室、卫生院、税务局等十二个单位处理人民来信、来访工作进行了一次检查。从检查结果来看，除了县公安局、税务局等单位由于领导重视，制度比较健全以外，大部分单位对处理人民来信工作都做得很不好。例如县供销合作社、卫生院、樟村区公所、人民银行和城关镇人民委员会等五个单位对这项工作根本无人负责，混乱现象很严重。这些单位到底受理了多少件人民来信？办了多少件？丢了多少件？也没有人知道。县供销合作社的秘书股长满不在乎地对检查人员说：“除了报社转来的几件人民来信已经处理或退回外，好像只收到过一件群众来信。”但后来经过检查，只是县人民监察委员会等三个单位转给供销合作社处理的人民来信就有二十三件，其中有三件已经遗失了，还有一件供销社业务经理部第二副经理程化龙看后认为不重要，就撕了扔进字纸篓里。樟村区公所的有些工作人员把人民来信放进荷包里，长期忘了处理。前县监察委员会转给区公所处理的十三件人民来信，现查明已丢了九件。城关镇人民委员会受理的十一件人民来信，都积压了半年以上没有处理。县民政科等两个单位把收到未办的七件人民来信送进档案室归档。更严重的是，县卫生院还曾把城关镇第一届三次人民代表大会的三件提案不作处理答复而就归档了事。
      县人民委员会原有三个意见箱，由于无人管理，一个已被大水冲跑了；一个因日晒风吹和没有修理已经损坏无用；剩下一个没有上锁，箱内蛛网密布。县人民银行等三个单位设置的意见箱也没有人负责管理，几个月才开箱一次。卫生院今年六月开箱的时候，发现有去年十二月投进的两封人民来信。
    经过这次检查后，婺源县人民委员会已经召集了县直各单位有关人员会议，检查了过去的处理人民来信工作，研究了改进办法；对于有关失职人员上饶专署已责成该县人民委员会分别予以批评或纪律处分。监察部公民控诉处理局
