Sichuan pickled mustard tuber production greatly increased

The five counties of Jiangbei, Ba County, Changshou, Fuling, and Fengdu in Sichuan Province are renowned pickled mustard tuber producing areas. This year, the green vegetable heads (raw material for pickled mustard tuber) in this area have once again had a bumper harvest. The three counties of Fuling, Changshou, and Fengdu alone have produced more than 393,000坛 (tan) of pickled mustard tuber (80 市斤 (shi jin) per 坛 (tan)) from the harvested green vegetable heads, which is nearly 18 times the amount of pickled mustard tuber produced in 1950. These already packaged pickled mustard tubers are now being shipped out.

September is the season for sowing pickled mustard tubers. In order to respond to the Party's call, governments and vegetable farmers in various pickled mustard tuber producing areas are striving to increase the yield per unit area on the basis of the original cultivation area, so as to produce more and better pickled mustard tubers to supply the people of various regions and for export. Government departments have already begun to strengthen technical research and experiments and further prevention and control measures for diseases and insect pests; vegetable farmers are also actively opening up fertilizer sources and collecting fertilizers to lay the foundation for next year's bumper harvest.

    四川榨菜产量大大提高
    四川省江北、巴县、长寿、涪陵和酆都五县，是驰名的榨菜产区，今年这一带的青菜头（榨菜原料）又获丰收。仅涪陵、长寿、酆都三个县收的青菜头就制成了三十九万三千多坛榨菜（每坛八十市斤），比一九五零年生产的榨菜量将近提高十八倍。现在这些已经包装好的榨菜正在往外调运。
    九月份正是榨菜播种的季节，各地榨菜产区的政府和菜农，为了响应党的号召，在原有栽培面积的基础上，努力提高单位面积产量，以生产更多更好的榨菜供应各地人民和外销，政府部门已经开始加强技术研究试验和进一步病虫害的防治办法；菜农们也积极开辟肥源、采集肥料，为明年丰收打下基础。　（黄振祖）
