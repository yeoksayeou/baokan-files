    Shuangyashan Mining Bureau Should Not Privately Recruit Large Numbers of Workers
    To the Editor:
    The Shuangyashan Mining Bureau newly hired 1,463 permanent workers and 179 temporary workers in the first half of this year. Among them, 150 were approved by the responsible superior authorities, 722 were employed according to the labor plan for this year, and the rest were all privately recruited. As a result, the actual number of employees in this bureau greatly exceeded the national labor plan. If we compare the actual average number of registered employees in the first half of this year with the planned number, it exceeds by 632 people. In terms of wages alone, this results in an extra expenditure of more than 80,000 RMB per month. In addition, four of the workers privately recruited by the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau this time were registered workers from the Muling Forestry Bureau. This hinders their labor management work and creates a negative political impact.
    The leading staff of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau neglect labor organization work, and instead of improving the work efficiency of existing employees and leveraging the effectiveness of machinery, they believe that "more people means it's easier to get things done," one-sidedly emphasizing production needs and repeatedly violating the relevant instructions of higher authorities regarding labor planning. For example, the Lingxi Vertical Shaft is a newly transferred production mine, and some equipment and personnel have not yet been settled. Instead of actively rectifying this, they believe that "this is a new unit" and it's fine to have more people. This approach is obviously wrong. We hope they will conduct an inspection and deal with it seriously.

### 双鸭山矿务局不该私自招收大批工人

    双鸭山矿务局不该私自招收大批工人编辑同志：
    双鸭山矿务局今年上半年新招用固定工人一千四百六十三名，临时工人一百七十九名；其中有一百五十名是经过主管上级批准的，有七百二十二名是按本年度劳动计划采用的，其余全是私自招收的。因此，这个局的实际职工人数就大大地超过了国家的劳动计划。如果拿今年上半年实际平均在册人数同计划人数相比较，超过了六百三十二人。这样，仅工资一项，每月就多支出人民币八万多元。此外，双鸭山矿务局这次私自招收的工人中，有四名是穆棱森林工业局的在册工人。这就妨碍了他们的劳动管理工作，造成不良的政治影响。
    双鸭山矿务局的领导工作人员忽视劳动组织工作，不去提高现有职工的工作效率和发挥机械的效能，而是认为“人多好办事”，片面强调生产需要，一再违反上级有关劳动计划的指示。例如，岭西竖井是个新移交生产的矿井，有一部分设备、人员还没有安顿就绪，他们不是从积极方面加以整顿，却认为“这是个新单位”，人多点就多点。这种做法显然是错误的。希望他们进行检查，并严肃地加以处理。
