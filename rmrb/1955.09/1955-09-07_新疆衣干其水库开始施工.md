Construction Begins on the Yiganqi Reservoir in Xinjiang

The Yiganqi Reservoir project, located east of Shache County in southern Xinjiang Province, close to the right bank of the Yarkand River, began construction on August 27. This is the largest reservoir in Xinjiang Province, built by the masses and subsidized by the state during the country's first Five-Year Plan. Upon completion in 1957, it will have a water storage capacity of 40 to 50 million cubic meters. It will not only ensure sufficient water for the existing 290,000 mu of cultivated land and the newly reclaimed wasteland this year in Makit County, Xinjiang's key cotton-growing county, but also guarantee water for the reclamation of another 30,000 to 70,000 mu of wasteland.

This reservoir is being built using the original Yiganqi Cao Lake. Through newly built canals, it can also divert and store floodwaters and winter leisure water from the Yarkand River. The reservoir project (including canal works) requires a total of 1.31 million cubic meters of earthwork. The structures include a reinforced concrete spillway gate and 29 bridges, aqueducts, and water gates with wooden pile structures. The funds required for the project, in addition to the government's investment of 400,000 yuan, will be raised by the local Uyghur farmers themselves.

    新疆衣干其水库开始施工
    位于新疆省南部莎车县城东面，紧靠叶尔羌河右岸的衣干其水库工程，在八月二十七日开始施工。这是新疆省在国家第一个五年计划期间，由群众兴办、国家资助的最大的水库；到一九五七年全部完工后，可以蓄水四千万到五千万立方公尺，不但可以保证新疆的重点植棉县麦盖提县现有的二十九万亩耕地和今年新垦的荒地有充足用水，还可以保证再开垦三万至七万亩荒地的用水。
    这个水库是利用原有的衣干其草湖修建的，通过新建的渠道，还可以引蓄叶尔羌河的洪水和冬闲水。水库工程（包括渠道工程）共需土方一百三十一万公方，建筑物有钢筋混凝土泄水闸一座，木梢结构的桥梁、渡槽和水闸等二十九座。工程所需资金，除由政府投资四十万元外，其余由当地的维吾尔族农民自筹。
