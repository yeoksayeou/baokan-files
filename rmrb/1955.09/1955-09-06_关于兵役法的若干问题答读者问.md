Editor's Note: After our newspaper published the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)" on February 15, 1955, we successively received many letters from readers expressing their firm support for the implementation of the compulsory military service system. Some readers also raised some questions about certain provisions of the Military Service Law. Now that the Military Service Law has been officially promulgated and implemented, we have compiled these questions and answers below.

    Q: The Military Service Law does not stipulate general military service obligations for female citizens. Does this constitute gender inequality?
    A: No, it does not. According to Article 96 of our country's Constitution, "Women in the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres, political，economic，cultural，social and family life." Chinese women are equal to men in rights. Serving in the military is an obligation that citizens should fulfill to the country, but not every citizen can fulfill this obligation. Some citizens are restricted by age and physical condition and cannot fulfill this obligation. The reason why the Military Service Law does not stipulate general military service obligations for female citizens is that the physical condition and physiological characteristics of female citizens are not suitable for the requirements of a modern army. This is a necessary consideration for female citizens by the state and does not affect their equal rights with men in the slightest. Not only female citizens, but also some male citizens cannot fulfill the obligation of military service due to physical limitations, which also does not affect their equal status in rights. As for female citizens who have received medical, veterinary, and other specialized technical training, according to Article 12 of the Military Service Law, the Ministry of National Defense has the right to register them for reserve duty and may organize them to participate in centralized training when necessary. In wartime, they can be conscripted into the army. Female citizens who have not received the above-mentioned specialized technical training but meet the requirements can also receive specialized technical training. Such provisions are more appropriate in all aspects.
    Q: Do personnel working in Party and government departments, people's organizations, public and private enterprises, and schools have to serve in the military?
    A: In our country, the rights and obligations of the people are completely consistent. No one only fulfills obligations without enjoying rights; no one can only enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations. Article 2 of the Military Service Law stipulates: "Male citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen have the obligation to serve in the military in accordance with the provisions of this law, regardless of their nationality, race, occupation, social origin, religious belief, or education level." According to this provision, staff members in Party and government departments, people's organizations, public and private enterprises, and schools have the obligation to serve in the military from the age of eighteen until they reach the retirement age. Their current work is a social occupation of citizens and cannot exempt them from the obligation of military service. As for whether to conscript them for active service, it will be determined based on national needs and specific circumstances.
    Q: Why are counter-revolutionaries and other people who have been deprived of their political rights not allowed to serve in the military?
    A: Our army is an armed force belonging to the people and a defender of the people's interests. To maintain the purity of our army, we must never allow counter-revolutionaries and other people who have been deprived of their political rights to sneak into our army. At the same time, military service is a glorious obligation of citizens, and counter-revolutionaries and other people who have been deprived of their political rights are not qualified to undertake this glorious obligation.
    Q: The conscription age is stipulated as eighteen years old. Does this mean that only male citizens who are eighteen years old are conscripted for each regular conscription?
    A: Yes, only male citizens who have reached the age of eighteen are conscripted into the army for active service during each regular conscription. However, when our country first implemented the compulsory military service system, male citizens who were over eighteen years old had not yet been incorporated into the second category of reserve service. According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, they still have the obligation to serve in the military. Therefore, in the first few years of implementing the Military Service Law, if the country needs it, it may still conscript male citizens of several ages into the army for active service. As for how many people of each age need to be conscripted and how many people need to be conscripted, the State Council will make regulations based on national needs and local conditions.
    Q: Why are there differences in the active service periods of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, with three, four, and five years?
    A: This is stipulated based on the training time required for each service to master modern military technology. The Military Service Law stipulates that the term of active service is three, four, and five years, which is suitable for our country's current situation. If the active service time is stipulated too long, it will affect the accumulation progress of our country's reserve soldiers, which is not conducive to national defense construction; if the stipulation is too short, not only will it fail to meet the requirements for mastering modern military technology, but also the number of annual conscriptions and retirements will increase, and the proportion of new recruits will increase, which will affect the combat effectiveness of the army and is also not conducive to national defense construction.
    Q: Why is there a provision for extending the term of active service? Why is it stipulated that the extension shall not exceed four months?
    A: The active service period of non-commissioned officers and soldiers cannot be changed arbitrarily. However, sometimes the army is performing a certain task and cannot be discharged on time, or sometimes it is necessary to extend the active service period due to certain circumstances. The Military Service Law stipulates that the extension of the active service period of non-commissioned officers and soldiers shall not exceed four months because a four-month period can adapt to the general situation of the army.
    Q: Why is it stipulated that overstaying the active service period must be at least one year?
    A: Because there is only one regular conscription and retirement each year, overstaying the active service period must be consistent with this time in order to unify retirement and uniform replenishment. If discharged midway in less than a year, it will cause vacancies in the army and affect the army's regularization and modernization construction.
    Q: The Military Service Law stipulates that the reserve service period for non-commissioned officers and soldiers is up to the age of forty. Can it be extended or shortened?
    A: Extending or shortening it is inappropriate. Because stipulating it shorter (such as stipulating it as thirty-five years old) will reduce the number of people serving in the reserve service. If it is stipulated longer (such as stipulating it as forty-five years old), it is not suitable according to the general physical condition of our people, and it is also unnecessary according to our country's population situation.
    Q: Why must the time for conscription be regular, and why is it stipulated that it should be carried out between November 1st of each year and the end of February of the following year?
    A: The reason why there must be a regular conscription time is to establish a regular replenishment and regular retirement system for the army, and to establish a regular training system for the army. Otherwise, it will not only affect the establishment of the army's regular system, but also affect the arrangement of the entire local work. The reason for stipulating that it be carried out within this time is that at this time, most parts of our country are in the slack farming season, so that the conscription work will not affect agricultural production. The reason for stipulating that there is a four-month conscription time is that our country has a vast territory, and the time when various places enter the slack farming season also varies. Stipulating a longer conscription time will facilitate various places to choose an appropriate time to carry it out based on local conditions. In fact, in a county or a province, the conscription work can be completed in about one month or a little more.
    Q: Why should a citizen who needs to change the conscription area complete the transfer registration procedures before July 31 of the conscription year?
    A: Because after this time, it is close to the conscription time. If the conscripted citizen changes the conscription area at will, it will not only make it impossible to formulate the conscription plan and affect the entire conscription work, but also make it difficult for the military service organs in his newly relocated area to understand his situation and determine whether he should be conscripted for active service. Therefore, it is necessary to have a time and condition limit for changing the conscription area.
    Q: What is the difference between deferment and peacetime exemption from active service?
    A: Deferment does not mean no conscription, but temporary non-conscription, deferred to the next conscription. For example, Article 23 of the Military Service Law stipulates that if a citizen to be conscripted cannot serve in active service temporarily due to illness, the conscription may be deferred, which means that when the illness is cured, he will report for conscription next time. Another example is Article 25 of the Military Service Law, which stipulates that students who are studying in universities and colleges are deferred, which means that they will not be conscripted during their studies. Peacetime exemption from active service means that they will not serve in the army in peacetime and will be incorporated into the second category of reserve service. For example, as stipulated in Article 24 of the Military Service Law, if a citizen to be conscripted is the only labor force maintaining his family life or is an only child, he may be exempted from active service in peacetime after being examined and approved by the local military service committee.
    Although the provisions for deferment and peacetime exemption from active service are to take care of certain special circumstances of citizens to be conscripted, they are also based on the overall interests of the country and the people. For example, deferring conscription for university and college students is not only to take care of students' studies, but is also beneficial to the country in training various specialized talents; stipulating that the only labor force maintaining family life can be exempted from active service in peacetime is not only to take care of his family life, but also to avoid increasing the burden of mass cultivation and national relief. The provision that an only child can be exempted from active service in peacetime is to take care of the habits of our society. From the current understanding and relationship of our people towards the family, such a provision is still more appropriate.
    Q: What is reserve service? Why should reserve service be classified and graded?
    A: Reserve service is a type of military service obligation that is different from active service. Those who serve in the military are called active duty soldiers, and those who are incorporated into the reserve service are called reserve soldiers. Reserve soldiers should participate in reserve service training for a certain period of time according to the order of the Ministry of National Defense during their reserve service period, and should be prepared to respond to conscription for active service after the state issues a mobilization order. According to the provisions of each article in Chapter 3 of the Military Service Law, the reserve service of non-commissioned officers and soldiers is divided into two categories according to military quality. The first category of reserve soldiers are those who have served in active service in the army, and the second category of reserve soldiers are those who have not served in active service in the army. They are also divided into two grades according to age, that is, under 30 years old is the first grade, and under 40 years old is the second grade. The purpose of classification and grading is mainly to comprehensively understand the military quality and age of reserve soldiers, so as to conduct training with different content and prepare for conscription in wartime. Therefore, all reserve soldiers who are incorporated into the reserve service must actively participate in reserve service training according to the order of the Ministry of National Defense; on the other hand, they must be prepared at all times, and once imperialism launches a war of aggression against our country, they must resolutely respond to the country's call to strike the enemy.
    Q: Do the first category of reserve soldiers who have served in active service in the army also need to participate in reserve service training?
    A: The first category of reserve soldiers also need to participate in training for a certain period of time in order to master the skills they have learned or to adapt to the new development requirements in technology.
    Q: What care does the state provide for reserve soldiers during the training period?
    A: Participating in training is an obligation that reserve soldiers should fulfill. Their living expenses and round-trip travel expenses during the training period are provided by the state. If reserve soldiers are workers or staff members, their original job positions will be retained by their original work units during their participation in training, and a certain amount of wages will be paid. This is because workers and staff members rely entirely on wages to maintain their family life, and it is appropriate to provide such care. As for the living care for farmers, handicraftsmen, and other laborers when participating in reserve service training, the State Council will formulate handling methods. Regarding the living care for reserve officers during their participation in training, Article 44 of the Military Service Law has already stipulated that they can receive subsidies according to the standards stipulated by the Ministry of National Defense.
    Q: Can soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have been demobilized or transferred to civilian work before the promulgation of the Military Service Law be incorporated into the first category of reserve service?
    A: Yes, they can. The state can, according to the needs of national defense and in accordance with the provisions of the Military Service Law, incorporate those among them who are still suitable for military service into the first category of reserve service.
    Q: The maximum age for officers to serve in active service and reserve service varies for different ranks and services. What is the basis for this regulation?
    A: This regulation is determined based on the requirements of different ranks and different positions of various officers. Generally speaking, the positions held by officers with lower ranks require strong bodies. If they are too old, they cannot be competent, so the maximum age for them to serve in active service and reserve service is lower; the positions held by officers with higher ranks require richer experience and knowledge of military science. At the same time, it also takes more years of service to obtain a higher rank, so the maximum age for them to serve in active service and reserve service is higher. The reason why the maximum age for naval officers to serve in active service and reserve service is higher than that of army and air force officers is mainly because naval technology is complex, the learning time for officers also needs to be longer, and at the same time, the physical exertion of naval officers is not as great as that of air force officers, so it is acceptable for them to serve at a higher age.
    Q: Can cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who have been transferred to civilian work in the past be incorporated into the officer reserve?
    A: Yes, they can. Because they have a high degree of political awareness and rich combat experience under the long-term education of the Communist Party of China, they transferred from the army to adapt to the needs of national construction, so the state can and needs to incorporate those among them who are still suitable for officer positions into the officer reserve.
    Q: Can personnel serving in non-military departments serve as reserve officers?
    A: Yes, they can. Personnel serving in non-military departments can be incorporated into the officer reserve as reserve officers if they are suitable for officer positions and are granted the rank of reserve officer.
    Q: What is the difference between the military training conducted for senior high school students and university students? Will this training affect students' studies?
    A: The significance and purpose of military training for senior high school and university students are different. Military training for senior high school students is pre-conscription military training, and the purpose is to enable them to understand general military knowledge. Military training for university students is to train reserve officers, so that they can respond to the country's call to assume officer positions when necessary. Military training for students in schools above the senior high school level is carried out gradually in the school by military instructors within the school's organization as a course, and will not affect students' other studies.
    Q: Do female students in schools above the senior high school level also have to participate in military training?
    A: Military training for students in senior high schools and schools equivalent to senior high schools is pre-conscription military training. Because female students generally do not have the obligation to serve in active service, it is not stipulated that they receive military training. However, they can also learn military common sense and participate in military sports activities, such as air defense, poison prevention, and first aid. Female students in universities who are studying specialized technologies related to the military (such as medical service, telecommunications, etc.) can also participate in military training; those who pass the examination after training can also obtain the rank of reserve lieutenant.

### 关于兵役法的若干问题答读者问

    关于兵役法的若干问题答读者问
    编者按：本报在一九五五年二月十五日刊载了“中华人民共和国兵役法（修正草案）”以后，陆续收到很多读者来信，表示坚决拥护实行义务兵役制。也有一部分读者对兵役法的若干规定提出了一些问题。现在兵役法已经正式公布施行，我们特将这些问题汇集答复如下。
    问：兵役法没有规定女性公民的一般兵役义务，这是不是男女不平等？
    答：不是的。根据我国宪法第九十六条“中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利。”的规定，我国妇女同男子在权利上是平等的。服兵役，是公民对国家应尽的义务，但不是每一个公民都能够履行这一义务，有些公民因为年龄和身体条件的限制，不能履行这种义务。兵役法所以不规定女性公民的一般兵役义务，就是因为女性公民的身体条件和生理上的特点，不适合现代化军队的要求。这是国家对女性公民的必要的照顾，丝毫不影响女性公民享有同男子平等的权利。不只是女性公民，就是在男性公民中，也会有一些人，因为身体条件的限制而不能履行服兵役的义务，这也同样不影响他们在权利上的平等地位。至于受过医务、兽医和其他专门技术训练的女性公民，根据兵役法第十二条的规定，国防部有权对她们进行预备役登记，必要时可以组织她们参加集训，在战时可以征集她们到军队中服役，对没有受过上述专门技术训练而条件适合的女性公民，也可以进行专门技术训练。这样的规定，从各方面来说都是比较合适的。
    问：在党政部门、人民团体、公私企业和学校中工作的人员，是不是都要服兵役？
    答：在我们的国家里，人民的权利和义务是完全一致的。任何人不会是只尽义务，不享受权利；任何人也不能只享受权利，不尽义务。兵役法第二条规定：“中华人民共和国年满十八岁的男性公民，不分民族、种族、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰和教育程度，都有义务依照本法的规定服兵役。”按照这一规定，党政部门、人民团体、公私企业和学校中的工作人员，从年满十八岁到年满退役年龄时为止，都有服兵役的义务。他们现在的工作，是公民的社会职业，不能因此而免除他们服兵役的义务。至于是否征集他们服现役，那要根据国家需要和具体情况来确定。
    问：为什么反革命分子和其他被剥夺政治权利的人不得服兵役？
    答：我们的军队是属于人民的武装力量，是人民利益的保卫者，为了保持我们军队的纯洁，绝不能让反革命分子和其他被剥夺政治权利的人钻到我们的军队中来。同时，服兵役是公民的光荣义务，反革命分子和其他被剥夺政治权利的人是没有资格承担这一光荣义务的。
    问：征集年龄规定为年满十八岁，是不是每年定期征集时只征集十八岁的男性公民？
    答：是在每年定期征集时只征集年满十八岁的男性公民入伍服现役。但在我国刚开始实行义务兵役制时，已经超过十八岁的男性公民还没有被编入第二类预备役，根据兵役法的规定，他们仍有服兵役的义务，所以在实施兵役法的头几年内，如果国家需要，还可能征集几个年龄的男性公民入伍服现役。至于需要征集几个年龄的人和征集多少人，将由国务院根据国家需要和各地情况作出规定。
    问：军士和兵的服现役期限，为什么有三年、四年和五年的区别？
    答：这是根据各军种掌握现代化军事技术所需要的训练时间规定的，兵役法规定服现役的期限为三、四、五年是适合我国目前情况的。如果现役时间规定长了，就会影响我国预备役兵员的积累进度，对于国防建设不利；如果规定的短了，不仅不能达到掌握现代化军事技术的要求，而且每年征集和退伍的数量就会加大，新兵的比重加大，就会影响到军队的战斗力，对国防建设也是不利的。
    问：为什么有延长现役期限的规定？又为什么规定延长不得超过四个月？
    答：军士和兵的现役期限是不能任意改变的。但有时因为军队正在执行某种任务不能按时退伍，或因某种情况的需要，有时不得不延长现役期限。兵役法规定延长军士和兵的现役期限不得超过四个月，是因为四个月的期限就可以适应军队的一般情况了。
    问：超期服现役为什么规定至少一年？
    答：因为每年只有一次定期的征集和退伍，超期服现役必须和这个时间相一致，以便统一退伍和统一补充。如果不到一年而中途退伍，就会使军队缺额，影响军队的正规化现代化建设。
    问：军士和兵服预备役的期限，兵役法规定到年满四十岁为止，是不是还可以延长或者缩短？
    答：延长或者缩短，都是不妥当的。因为规定得短些（如规定为三十五岁），就会使服预备役的人数减少，如果规定得长些（如规定为四十五岁），根据我国人民身体的一般情况是不适合的，同时根据我国人口情况也是不必要的。
    问：征集服兵役的时间为什么要有定期，又为什么规定在每年十一月一日到下一年二月底的时间内进行？
    答：所以要有定期的征集时间，是为了建立军队的定期补充和定期退伍制度，建立军队正规的训练制度。否则，不但影响军队正规制度的建立，而且会影响到整个地方工作的安排。所以要规定在这个时间内进行，是由于在这个时间，我国各地一般正是农闲季节，不致因征集工作而影响到农业生产。所以要规定有四个月的征集时间，是因为我国国土广大，各地进入农闲时间也先后不一，征集时间规定得长一些，就便于各地根据当地情况来选择适当时间进行。实际上在一个县或一个省来说，征集工作大约有一个月或一个月多一些的时间就可以完成的。
    问：应征公民需要改变征集区时，为什么要在征集年度的七月三十一日以前办妥转移登记手续？
    答：因为在这个时间以后，已经接近了征集时间，如果应征公民随便改变征集区，不仅会使征集计划无法拟定，影响整个征集工作，而且会使他新移居地区的兵役机关，难于了解他的情况和确定他是否应征服现役。所以改变征集区，有一个时间和条件的限制是必要的。
    问：缓征和平时免服现役有什么不同呢？
    答：缓征并不是不征，而是暂时不征，缓到下次征集时再征。例如兵役法第二十三条规定，应征公民因病暂时不能服现役时，可以缓征，就是说病好了，下次征集时再报到应征。又如兵役法第二十五条规定，正在高等学校就学的学生缓征，就是说在他们就学期间不征。平时免服现役，就是平时不到军队中服现役而编入第二类预备役。例如兵役法第二十四条所规定的，应征公民如果是维持他的家庭生活的唯一劳动力或者是独子，在征集时经当地兵役委员会审查批准，平时可以免服现役。
    缓征和平时免服现役的规定，虽然是为了照顾应征公民的某些特殊情况，但也是从国家和人民的整体利益出发的。例如对高等学校学生的缓征，不但是为了照顾学生的学业，而且对于国家培养各种专门人材也是有利的；规定维持家庭生活的唯一劳动力平时可以免服现役，不但是为了照顾他的家庭生活，而且也不致因此增加群众代耕和国家救济等负担。关于独子平时可以免服现役的规定，则是为了照顾我国社会的习惯，从目前我国人民对家庭的认识和关系上来看，这样规定还是比较适当的。
    问：什么是预备役？预备役为什么要分类分等？
    答：预备役是区别于现役的一种兵役义务。在军队中服兵役的叫现役军人，编入预备役的人叫预备役军人。预备役军人在服预备役期间都应当根据国防部的命令参加一定时间的预备役集训，在国家发布动员令后，都应当准备应征服现役。按照兵役法第三章各条的规定，军士和兵的预备役按军事素养分为两类，第一类预备役军人是在军队服过现役的，第二类预备役军人是没有在军队服过现役的。又按年龄各分为两等，即三十岁以下为第一等，四十岁以下为第二等。分类分等的目的，主要是为了全面地了解预备役军人的军事素养和年龄，以便进行不同内容的训练，并为战时的征集作好准备。所以凡是编入预备役的预备役军人，一方面要根据国防部的命令，积极参加预备役集训；另一方面要时刻准备着，一旦帝国主义向我国发动侵略战争时，就要坚决响应国家的征召，去打击敌人。
    问：第一类预备役军人在军队中服过现役，是不是也要参加预备役集训？
    答：第一类预备役军人为了熟练已经学会的技术或者为适应技术上新的发展的要求，也需要参加一定时间的训练。
    问：国家对预备役军人在集训期间的生活有什么照顾？
    答：参加集训是预备役军人应尽的义务。他们在集训期间的生活费用和往返路费由国家供给。预备役军人如果是工人或职员，在参加集训期间，原工作单位仍保留他们的原工作职位，并发给一定的工资。这是因为工人和职员完全依靠工资维持其家庭生活，给予这种照顾是应当的。至于农民、手工业者和其他劳动者在参加预备役集训时的生活照顾问题，将由国务院规定处理办法。关于预备役军官在参加集训期间的生活照顾问题，兵役法第四十四条已有规定，他们可以按照国防部规定的标准领取补助金。
    问：在兵役法公布前已经复员或者转业的人民解放军军人，是否可以编入第一类预备役？
    答：可以的。国家可以根据国防的需要，按照兵役法的规定，把他们中间仍适合服兵役的，编入第一类预备役。
    问：军官服现役和预备役的最高年龄，各种级别和兵种都不相同，这种规定的根据是什么？
    答：这种规定是根据各种军官的不同衔级和不同职务的要求来确定的。一般说来，军衔较低的军官所担负的职务，需要强壮的身体，如果年龄过大，是不能胜任的，所以他们服现役和预备役的最高年龄就较低；军衔较高的军官所担任的职务，需要更丰富的经验和军事学术的知识，同时取得较高军衔也需要更多的服役年限，所以他们服现役和预备役的最高年龄就较高。海军军官服现役和预备役的最高年龄所以比陆军和空军军官高，主要是因为海军技术复杂，军官的学习时间也需要长一些，同时，海军军官的体力消耗也不像空军那样大，服役年龄高一些是可以的。
    问：过去已经转业的中国人民解放军干部，是不是可以编入军官预备役？
    答：可以的。因为他们在中国共产党的长期教育下，有着高度的政治觉悟和丰富的战斗经验，他们转业离开军队，是为了适应国家建设的需要，所以国家可以而且也需要把他们中间仍适合担任军官职务的人，编入军官预备役。
    问：在非军事部门中服务的人员，能否担任预备役军官？
    答：能够的。在非军事部门中服务的人员，如果适合担任军官职务，并被授予预备役军官军衔后，就可以编入军官预备役担任预备役军官。
    问：对高级中学学生和高等学校学生进行的军事训练有什么区别？这种训练是不是会影响学生的学业？
    答：对高级中学和高等学校学生的军事训练，其意义和目的是不相同的。对高级中学学生的军事训练，是征集前的军事训练，目的是使他们懂得一般军事知识。对高等学校学生的军事训练，则是为了培养预备役军官，以便在必要时使他们能够响应国家的征召，担任军官职务。高级中学以上学校的学生的军事训练，是作为一门课程由学校编制内的军事教员在学校内逐步进行的，不会影响学生的其他学业。
    问：高级中学以上学校的女学生，是不是也要参加军事训练？
    答：高级中学和相当于高级中学的学校的学生受军事训练是征集前的军事训练。女学生因为一般地没有服现役的义务，因此不规定她们受军事训练。但她们也可以学习军事常识，参加军事体育活动，如防空、防毒、救护等。在高等学校内学习和军事有关的专门技术（如医务、电讯等）的女学生，也可以参加军事训练；训练后经考试合格的，也可以取得预备役尉官军衔。
