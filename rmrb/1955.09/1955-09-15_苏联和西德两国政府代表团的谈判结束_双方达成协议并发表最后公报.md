During the negotiations, the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany was discussed. An agreement has been reached, which is reflected in the corresponding letters exchanged between the two sides (these letters will be subject to the approval of the Federal Government and the Federal Parliament, as well as the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR), deciding to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries, to establish embassies in Bonn and Moscow for this purpose, and to mutually dispatch diplomatic representatives at the level of ambassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

The two delegations agreed that the establishment of diplomatic relations will help develop mutual understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, in the interest of peace and European security.

The starting point for both sides in this regard is that the establishment and development of normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will facilitate the resolution of outstanding issues concerning the whole of Germany, and thus contribute to solving the main national problem of the German people – the reunification of the German democratic nation.
