    The Splendid Flowers of Vietnamese People's Culture
    — On the Constantly Developing Literary and Art Undertakings of the Vietnamese People
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    Just as the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe is receiving a warm welcome in various parts of China, a delegation of Vietnamese writers and journalists has also arrived in China. The Chinese people will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the excellent culture and art of the Vietnamese people through the visits and performances of these cultural envoys of Vietnam.
    The cultural arts of the Vietnamese people have a long history. Early on, Vietnamese artwork with distinctive national characteristics was already popular throughout Southeast Asia. Vietnamese folk literature is rich and varied. Many beautiful myths and legends are still circulating among the people. Poetry, lyrics, songs, and ballads are very popular. In Bac Ninh province alone, there are as many as thirty-six different melodies of folk songs. During the Spring Festival, men and women can sing antiphonally across the mountains for two or three days, searching for precise and beautiful verses while answering each other, until one side is unable to respond. The long poem "Kim Van Kieu" by the tenth-century poet Nguyen Du is a great work born from the excellent tradition of Vietnamese folk literature. This work still retains its bright colors today, hated by colonialists and feudal rulers but loved by the masses. Vietnamese classical opera "Cheo" (transliteration) is a highly comprehensive art form, and "Tuong," another classical opera derived from Chinese Peking Opera and Vietnamized, are both valuable treasures of Vietnamese people's literature and art. Vietnam is a multi-ethnic country, and the beautiful legends and songs and dances preserved in each ethnic group are even more treasures of Vietnamese people's literature and art.
    Since the French colonialists invaded Vietnam, they have vigorously promoted a policy of "enslavement." The colonialists not only prevented the Vietnamese people from learning their own history, but also prevented them from having their own culture and art. The colonialists would even shoot wherever they heard the sound of folk songs in the countryside. In those dark days, the culture and art of the Vietnamese people suffered brutal destruction.
    As with all aspects of the Vietnamese national democratic revolution, the party of the Vietnamese working class and laborers, the standard-bearer of Vietnamese people's liberation—the Vietnam Workers' Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party—were deeply concerned about the cultural and artistic undertakings of the Vietnamese people. From the day it was founded, the Indochinese Communist Party led the Vietnamese people to fight for independence, freedom, liberation, and also against the slave culture of the colonialists. In 1942, the Indochinese Communist Party further clarified in its "Cultural Program" that the direction of the development of Vietnamese people's culture and art must be: national, scientific, and mass-oriented, and called on literary and art workers to form the "Vietnam Cultural Salvation Association" to actively participate in the great "August Revolution." Later, during the arduous days of struggle, the Party never ceased to pay attention to literature and art. Soon after the start of the anti-Japanese war, in 1948, under the leadership and organization of the Indochinese Communist Party, the first National Congress of Literature and Art of Vietnam was held. At the same time, the first National Painting Exhibition of Vietnam was also held, the "Vietnam Association of Literary and Art Workers" was established, and the association's journal "Literature and Art" was published. In 1949, a debate on literary and artistic creation was launched in the anti-Japanese base area of North Vietnam. Through the analysis of specific works, literary and art workers further clarified the national, scientific, and mass-oriented direction of literature and art. In 1951, the second National Painting Exhibition was held, and a large-scale award ceremony for literary and artistic works was organized. Party leaders Ho Chi Minh and Truong Chinh personally wrote letters calling on literary and art workers to become brave warriors of the motherland, actively serving the anti-Japanese war, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and calling on writers and painters to create a large number of works depicting new characters. To this end, Ho Chi Minh personally wrote a model work, prompting the publication of the "Heroes and Warriors" series. In 1953, the Party led the literary and art circles in a rectification movement, and at the same time enabled literary and art workers to universally participate in actual struggles and participate in the great rent reduction and land reform movement in rural areas, which was of decisive significance for the improvement and development of Vietnamese literature and art. In the winter of 1954, shortly after the liberation of Hanoi, under the leadership of the Party, the first National Art Troupe Performance and the third Painting Exhibition were held in Vietnam. This performance brought together thousands of literary and art workers from south to north, performing many excellent operas and songs and dances. These literary and art programs, which inherited the excellent traditions of Vietnamese people's literature and art and absorbed rich nourishment in actual struggles, were deeply loved by the Vietnamese people and quickly spread throughout Vietnam. Some of these programs were performed at the World Youth Festival in Warsaw and in China, receiving a warm welcome.
    Here, we can briefly list some of the excellent works of Vietnamese people's literature and art in the past decade. During this period, the Vietnamese people experienced the greatest events in history, namely the victory of the "August Revolution," the victory of the long-term anti-Japanese war, and the victory of land reform and reconstruction. These excellent literary and artistic works reflect various historical events from different perspectives, and encourage and organize the people to fight for new victories. In poetry, there is the "To Huu Poetry Collection" published during the "August Revolution" period, the political satire poem "Anti-Japanese Laughter" serialized by Ho Trong Hieu during the anti-Japanese war, the poetry collection "Entrusting Children" by poet Tran Huu Thuat, the long poem "Viet Bac Resistance" by Tay ethnic poet Nong Quoc Chan, the poetry collection "The People's Era" by Man ethnic poet Ban Da Doan, and the poetry collection "Viet Bac" by To Huu published after the restoration of peace. Poets Nong Quoc Chan, Tran Huu Thuat, and young poet Thuc Ha's poems have all won awards at the first, second, and third World Youth Festivals. In the struggle, Vietnamese artists have also created many exciting songs, such as Van Cao's "March Song" (later changed to "National Anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam") and "Lo River Song," Nguyen Dinh Thi's "Eliminate Fascism" and "Hanoi People's Song," Do Nhuan's "Thao River Guerrilla" and "Dien Bien Phu Victory," Luu Huu Phuoc's "Leader Song" (i.e., "Ode to Ho Chi Minh"), Hoang Van's "Firecracker Song," and the collective creation of People's Army soldiers "The Opportunity Has Come" and the military cadre Doan Quang Khai's "Selfless for the People." In prose and novels, there are "Mining Area" by Vu Huy Tam, "Attack" by Nguyen Dinh Thi, "Cao Lang Chronicle" by Nguyen Huy Tuong, and "A Way Out" by Minh Luong, which won first, second, and third prizes in the National Literary and Art Works, respectively. Among them, the author of "Mining Area," which won the first prize, Vu Huy Tam, is a miner in the Hong Gai coal mine. In addition, works reflecting land reform and ethnic life include Nguyen Van Bong's "Water Buffalo," Nguyen Cong Hoan's "Peasants and Landlords," Kim Lan's "Getting Married," and To Hoai's "Northwest Story." Paintings include Su Ngoc Van's posthumous works "Hanoi Rises," "Guerrilla Night March," "Mobilizing the Masses," etc., 70 paintings by Nguyen Khiem reflecting various aspects of the achievements of the Southern resistance, as well as Tran Van Can's "Sewing Clothes in the Pit to Support the Army," Nguyen Van Thang's "Hatred of the Enemy Burning Villages," Mai Van Hien's "Reunion," Le Quoc Loc's "Restoration of Peace," etc. In theater, there are Nguyen Huy Tuong's "Those Who Stay," Vu Lang's "Relay," and the collective creation "Heroine Nguyen Thi Sau" reflecting the anti-Japanese war, and the collective creation "Sister Tram," "Sister Tang and Brother Dien" reflecting mass movements. In the later stages of the anti-Japanese war, Vietnamese literary and art workers also worked hard to excavate and sort out many beautiful dances from the precious cultural heritage of various ethnic groups, such as the Thai ethnic group's "Fan Dance," the Muong ethnic group's "Bamboo Grove Carnival Dance," the Southern "Season When Rice Ripens," and the Northern "Joyful Production Dance," all of which are deeply popular among the masses.
    In recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, Vietnamese people's literature and art have been advancing along a broad and healthy path of national, scientific, and mass orientation, and have achieved remarkable results. It should be especially mentioned that these valuable achievements of Vietnamese people's literature and art have been achieved in an extremely arduous struggle environment. People will forever remember with high respect the Vietnamese writers and artists who contributed their lives for the independence and liberation of the motherland, for the freedom and happiness of the people, and for the prosperity and development of progressive culture. They are the writer Nam Cao, the painter To Ngoc Van, the young literary and art worker of the army Tran Dang, the members of the Fourth Interzone Art Troupe and a certain art troupe in the Northwest region, and other martyrs.
    Vietnamese literary and art workers, following the will of the martyrs, under the teachings of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, closely rely on the people, draw themes from the people's struggle and labor, inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of Vietnamese people's literature and art, and learn from the world's advanced literature and art led by the Soviet Union. They have made Vietnamese literature and art blossom with splendid flowers in the garden of human progressive culture, and will continue to bloom even more splendid flowers in the future.

    越南人民文化灿烂的花朵
    ——记不断发展着的越南人民文艺事业
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    正当越南人民歌舞团在中国各地受到热烈欢迎的时候，越南作家、记者访问团也到了中国。中国人民将会从越南人民的文化使者的访问和演出中，更进一步地了解和学习越南人民优秀的文化艺术。
    越南人民的文化艺术有着悠久的历史。很早以来，富有民族特色的越南美术品就已经在东南亚受到各地人民的欢迎。越南的民间文学是丰富而多采的。许多美丽的神话和传说至今还在人民群众中流传着。诗、词、歌、谣十分盛行，仅北宁省的歌谣就有三十六调之多，春节的时候男女隔山对唱竟可以持续到两、三天，双方一边唱答一边寻找意义确切而美丽的诗句，直到一方对答不出来时为止。第十世纪诗人阮游的长诗“金云翘”，就是在越南民间文学的优良传统中诞生出来的伟大作品，这个作品到现在还保持着鲜明的色彩，它为殖民者和封建统治者所憎恨而为人民群众所热爱。越南人民古典戏“焦”（译音），是一种综合性很高的艺术，它和从中国京剧传来而越南化了的另一种古典戏“传”，都是越南人民文艺可贵的财富。越南是个多民族的国家，保存在各民族里的优美的传说和歌舞，更是越南人民文艺的宝藏了。
    法国殖民者自从侵入越南，便极力推行“奴化”政策。殖民者不仅不让越南人民学习自己的历史，而且也不让越南人民有自己的文化艺术。殖民者甚至在农村听到哪里有歌谣的声音，就朝哪里开枪射击。在那黑暗的日子里，越南人民文化艺术遭受到横暴的摧残。
    正如对待越南民族民主革命各个方面一样，越南工人阶级和劳动者的政党、越南人民解放的旗手——越南劳动党和它的前身印度支那共产党，非常关怀越南人民的文化艺术事业。印度支那共产党自它诞生的那一天起，就领导越南人民为独立、为自由、为解放、同时也为反对殖民者的奴隶文化而斗争。到一九四二年，印度支那共产党更在自己的“文化提纲”里，明确地规定越南人民文化艺术发展的方向必须是：民族的、科学的、大众的，并且号召文艺者组成了“越南文化救国会”，积极参加了伟大的“八月革命”。后来在斗争艰苦的日子里，党始终不曾间断对文艺的关注。抗战刚开始不久，一九四八年，在印度支那共产党的领导和组织下，举行了越南全国第一次文艺大会，同时还举办了越南全国第一次绘画展览，成立“越南文学艺术工作者协会”，并出版会刊“文艺”。一九四九年，在北越抗战根据地里展开关于文艺创作的论争，通过对具体作品的分析，使文艺工作者进一步明确民族的、科学的和大众的文艺方向。一九五一年，举办全国第二次绘画展览，同时并组织了一次大规模的文艺作品评奖，党的领袖胡志明主席和长征同志亲自写信号召文艺工作者要成为祖国勇猛的战士，积极为抗战服务，为工农兵劳动人民服务，号召作家和画家大量创作表现新人物的题材，为此胡志明主席还亲笔写了一个示范性的作品，促使“英雄和战士”丛书的出版。一九五三年，党领导文艺界进行整风运动，同时并使文艺工作者能够普遍参加实际斗争，参加农村伟大的减租和土地改革运动，这对于越南文艺的提高和发展具有决定性的意义。一九五四年冬天，河内解放不久，在党的领导下举办越南全国第一次文工团大会演和第三次绘画展览。这一次大会演集中了从南到北上千名文艺工作者，表演了许多优秀的戏曲和歌舞，这些继承越南人民文艺优良传统并在实际斗争中吸取了丰富的营养的文艺节目，深深地得到越南人民的热爱，很快地就流传到越南各地，其中有些节目并在华沙的世界青年联欢节上和中国演出，受到了热烈的欢迎。
    这里，可以简略地列举越南人民文艺近十年来的一些优秀的作品。在这个期间，越南人民经历着历史上最伟大的事件，那就是“八月革命”的胜利，长期抗战的胜利以及土地改革和恢复建设的胜利。这些优秀的文艺作品从不同的角度反映了各个历史事件，并且鼓舞和组织人民为新的胜利而斗争。在诗歌方面，有“八月革命”时期出版的诗人素友的“素友诗集”、抗战期间连载的胡重孝的政治讽刺诗“抗战笑声”、诗人陈友椿的诗集“嘱咐孩子”、土族诗人侬国震的长诗“越北抗敌”、曼族诗人版大团的诗集“人民的时代”，和平恢复后出版素友的诗集“越北”。诗人侬国震、陈友椿和青年诗人叔河的诗歌都曾经在第一、第二、第三届世界青年联欢节上获奖。在斗争中，越南的艺术家们更创作了许多激动人心的歌曲，如文高的“进军歌”（后来改为“越南民主共和国国歌”）和“泸江之歌”，阮廷诗的“消灭法西斯”、“河内人之歌”，杜润的“滔河游击队”和“奠边府大捷”，刘友福的“领袖歌”（即“歌颂胡志明”），黄云的“拉炮歌”以及人民军战士集体创作的“时机已到”和军事干部尹光凯创作的“为人民而忘我”。在散文小说方面，有分别得到越南全国文艺作品一、二、三等奖的武辉心著“矿区”、阮廷诗著“冲击”、阮辉想著“高谅纪事”、明禄著“生路”等，其中得一等奖的“矿区”的作者武辉心是鸿基煤矿的一位矿工。此外反映土地改革和民族生活的作品有阮文棒的“水牛”、阮公欢的“农民和地主”、金麟的“结成夫妻”、苏怀的“西北传”等。绘画有画家苏玉云遗作“河内起来”、“游击队夜行军”、“发动群众”等，有反映南部抗战各个方面成就的画家阮谦所作的七十幅画，以及陈文锦的“坑中缝衣拥军”、阮文爽的“仇恨敌烧村”、梅文献的“相逢”、黎国禄的“和平恢复”等。在戏剧方面，有反映抗战的阮辉想作“留下的人”、武陵作“传报”、集体创作“女英雄阮氏毡”，有反映群众运动的“沉姊”、“糠姊和田兄”等集体创作。在抗战后期，越南文艺工作者还努力从各民族宝贵的文化遗产中，发掘和整理了许多优美的舞蹈，例如泰族的“扇子舞”、芒族的“竹丛联欢舞”、南部的“稻子熟了的季节”、北部的“生产欢乐舞”等都深受群众欢迎。
    这些年来，因为有着越南劳动党和胡志明主席的正确领导，越南人民文艺是沿着民族的、科学的和大众的宽阔而健康的道路前进，已经取得显著的成绩。特别应该提到的是，越南人民文艺这些可贵的成绩，是在极端艰苦的斗争环境中取得的。人们将永远怀着崇高的敬意记忆着那些为了祖国的独立解放、为了人民的自由幸福、为了进步文化的繁荣兴盛而贡献了自己生命的越南作家和艺术家们，他们是作家南高、画家苏玉云、部队青年文艺工作者陈登、第四联区文工队和西北区某文工队的队员以及其他烈士们。
    越南文艺工作者，遵循着烈士们的遗志，在党和胡志明主席的教导下，紧紧地依靠人民，从人民的斗争和劳动中吸取题材，继承和发扬越南人民文艺的优良传统，并向以苏联为首的世界先进的文艺学习，他们已经使越南的文艺在人类进步文化的园圃里开放了灿烂的花朵，今后还要继续开放更加灿烂的花朵。
