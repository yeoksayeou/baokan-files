    In the period from the end of 1954 to the beginning of 1955, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's Juvenile Department conducted a survey on children's extracurricular reading and found that primary and secondary school students had very few books. On average, schools had less than one book per student, and some schools had only one book for every two or three students. Comic books accounted for two-thirds of all books. New books were rarely purchased, generally only once every one or two years. For example, the Seventeenth Primary School in the Fourth District only bought children's books once from 1952 to the end of 1954. Many primary schools in the Fifth District had not bought any new books since the purchase before the "June 1st" Children's Day last year. When purchasing children's books, schools generally did not carefully select them based on children's preferences and needs, but rather did so haphazardly. Some school clerks would go to bookstores and say to the salesperson, "Give me 100,000 (old currency) yuan worth of books!" letting the bookstore choose the books randomly. Under these circumstances, children voiced many complaints, such as "The school has too few books!" "I can never borrow the books I want to read." "We've read all the books in the school library several times!"
    As children's reading needs were not being met, they went outside of school to find books. Many children became the main customers of comic book rental shops in the streets. As a result, bad books still secretly circulating in the market were spreading feudal, supernatural, and absurd poisons to the children. Children who read these books were greatly affected in their studies and health.
    The reason for this phenomenon was mainly due to the lack of understanding among school administrators, teachers, and counselors regarding the important significance of extracurricular reading for children. Some people believed that children's books had "no preservation value" and that buying them was a "waste," saying that it was "better to buy reference books for teachers." Some schools even used children's book funds to buy accordions and sports equipment. Some schools one-sidedly emphasized frugality, stopped purchasing children's books, and turned over all the funds.
    In response to the above situation, we carried out work to publicize and promote children's books.
    We first fully reported the above situation to the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau. The Education Bureau attached great importance to this situation. Later, the Education Bureau and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly issued a "Notice on Strengthening Extracurricular Reading Work for Children in Primary and Secondary Schools" to all primary and secondary schools in the city. The notice pointed out the serious situation of primary and secondary schools not paying attention to children's extracurricular reading and proposed improvement measures. The improvement measures stated that children's book funds should be used correctly to purchase new books for children. The Education Bureau allocated a special fund, stipulating an average of 2 jiao per student per year for primary school students (because secondary schools already had special funds), which could not be misappropriated. Schools should carefully and responsibly select children's books, and should regularly purchase new books for children on a quarterly or monthly basis. They should purchase a variety of books, newspapers, and magazines suitable for different grades, based on children's preferences, needs, and the actual situation of the school's existing books. Subject teachers, especially language teachers, homeroom teachers, and Young Pioneer counselors, have the responsibility to propose book lists according to grade level and children's interests. Schools should strengthen the publicity and guidance of children's extracurricular reading, carry out a variety of extracurricular reading activities, regularly introduce good books to children, tell them what books they should read, and increase their interest in reading.
    In order to better publicize children's books, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's Juvenile Department held the "Tianjin Children's Book Exhibition." In addition to organizing some children to visit, it also invited Young Pioneer counselors, language teachers, and library administrators from various schools to visit. The exhibition displayed a total of 17,000 children's books, divided into five parts: the great motherland, natural science, combat stories, fairy tales, and the development of good qualities in children. In each display section, storytelling, slide shows, experiments, and other methods were used to promote the books to the audience. For example, in the natural science section, team members performed interesting physics experiments while introducing "Adventures in the Physical World" and "One Hundred Thousand Whys."
    Through this exhibition, teachers and counselors were helped to realize that the existing children's books were not being fully utilized. For example, some counselors said, "I didn't know there were so many good books for children to read in the past. I will definitely buy new books for the children when I get back." Everyone agreed that this exhibition was a good way to publicize the content of books to children. During the month of the exhibition, Xinhua Bookstore distributed an additional 17,000 children's books. After many schools bought new books, they also held book exhibitions with themes such as "Making Friends with Books" and "Books are Our Close Companions." New books were quickly passed around among the children.
    At the same time, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's Juvenile Department suggested to all teachers and counselors that they spend more time reading children's books in their spare time. It also required full-time Young Pioneer counselors in middle schools to read two to three children's books each before and after the Tianjin Children's Book Exhibition. Everyone did so. Many counselors also wrote reading notes. Some counselors reviewed the losses their lack of reading children's books had brought to their work. Everyone realized that as an educator of children, they should read and study children's books well; otherwise, they would not be able to help children choose books, let alone introduce the most vivid and educational content in the books to children, so that children could be educated by the books. This stimulated the counselors' enthusiasm for guiding children's reading and corrected their past misconception that "children's reading is not my business, it's the library's business."
    While vigorously publicizing children's books, we established close contact with the Xinhua Bookstore and improved the methods of promoting children's books. The Xinhua Bookstore was responsible for compiling and printing catalogs of various newly arrived children's books, with simple explanations, and distributing them to schools to help teachers and counselors understand the newly arrived children's books at the Xinhua Bookstore in a timely manner. In addition, in order to meet the needs of readers and prevent stockouts, some new methods were also adopted: key recommendations for children's books and implementation of pre-ordering, that is, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Education Bureau jointly drafted a notice recommending children's books, which was sent to various schools for school administrators, teachers, and counselors to seriously promote to children; the Xinhua Bookstore simultaneously issued pre-order forms for key books, and the Xinhua Bookstore prepared enough books to supply based on the pre-order numbers. In the first half of the year, in order to cooperate with the labor education of sixth-grade students in primary schools, the key recommended "Han Meimei" adopted this method, and as a result, a total of 21,000 copies were sold throughout the city. Other examples include "Saying This, Doing This," "Reconciliation," "Three Good Friends," and "In the Days of Being Imprisoned with Dad," which were key recommendations around "June 1st" Children's Day to conduct quality education for children, and "How to Be a Young Pioneer," which was a key recommendation to actively and massively develop the Young Pioneers. They all adopted this method, and the effect was very good.
    In order to facilitate the selection and purchase of new books for children by various schools, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's Juvenile Department helped the Xinhua Bookstore department store organize two children's book displays, inviting administrative staff and library administrators from various schools to visit and select books. Teachers and counselors reflected that this approach was very helpful in helping them select books.
    Because of the work we have done above, children are buying significantly more books than before. According to the statistics of the Children's Book Department of Xinhua Bookstore, from December 1954 to June 1955, the number of children's books distributed increased by more than 90,000 copies compared with December 1953 to June 1954. The Fourteenth Primary School in the Sixth District had only 436 children's books in 1954, but now it has 1,184 copies, an increase of 748 copies. After the new books were bought to the school, the children happily surrounded them and asked: When can we borrow them to read! Some proposed: Let me put on the book number! Children who did not like to read in the past have now developed the habit of reading under the education of the Young Pioneers. Some children who used to like to read supernatural and absurd books are now attracted by books such as "Sun Wukong" and "Yue Fei Fighting Against the Jin Soldiers" and no longer read those bad books.

    天津市宣传和推销少年儿童读物的工作
    张文琴
    在一九五四年底到一九五五年初这段时间里面，天津市团委少年部对少年儿童课外阅读情况做了调查，发现中、小学校少年儿童读物很少，一般学校平均每人不到一本，甚至有的学校平均两三人才有一本，其中连环画占全部图书的三分之二。新书添购也很少，普遍是一两年才买一次新书。如四区十七小学，自一九五二年到一九五四年底只买了一次少年儿童读物。五区许多小学从去年“六一”儿童节前买了一次新书之后，一直没有再买新书。在购买少年儿童读物时，一般学校不是根据少年儿童的爱好和需要，慎重选择，而是潦草从事。有的学校事务员到书店向售货员说：“给我来十万（旧币）块钱的！”让书店随便给书。在这种情况下，孩子们的呼声很多，“学校的图书太少了！”“喜欢看的书老是借不到。”“学校的图书我们都看过好几遍了！”
    少年儿童的阅读要求得不到满足，他们便跑到校外去寻找。很多少年儿童成了街道上小人书出租处的主要顾客。于是尚在市场上秘密销行的坏书，在向孩子们散布着封建、神怪、荒诞的毒素。看了这些书的孩子们，在学习和健康方面都很受影响。
    造成这种现象的原因，主要是由于学校行政方面、教师和辅导员对少年儿童阅读课外书籍的重要意义认识不足。有人认为少年儿童读物“没保存价值”，买少年儿童读物是“浪费”，“不如买教师参考书”。有的学校竟用儿童图书经费买了风琴、体育用具。有的学校片面地强调节约，停止购买少年儿童读物，将这笔经费全部上缴了。
    针对上述情况，我们进行了宣传和推销少年儿童读物的工作。
    我们先将上述情况向天津市教育局做了全面的反映。教育局很重视这种情况。以后就由教育局和青年团天津市工作委员会联合向全市中、小学发出了“关于加强中、小学少年儿童课外阅读工作的通知”。通知中指出了目前中、小学不重视少年儿童课外阅读工作的严重情况，并提出了改进办法。在改进办法中指出：应正确地使用少年儿童图书经费，为少年儿童添购新书，教育局拨出一笔专款，规定小学生全年平均每人二角（因中学已有专款），此款不得任意挪用。各校应认真负责地选购少年儿童读物，要经常按季度或按月有计划地给少年儿童增购新书。并应根据孩子们的爱好、需要和本校现有图书的实际情况，购买适合不同年级的多种多样的图书和报纸、杂志。各科任教师特别是语文教师、班主任和少先队辅导员有责任按年级和少年儿童的爱好提出书目。各校应加强少年儿童课外阅读的宣传指导工作，开展多种多样的课外阅读活动，经常向少年儿童介绍好的读物，告诉孩子们应该看些什么书，提高他们的阅读兴趣。
    为了更好地宣传少年儿童读物，天津市团委少年部举办了“天津市少年儿童图书展览会”。除了组织一部分少年儿童参观外，并邀请了各校少先队辅导员、语文教师和图书馆管理员来参观。展览会上共陈列了一万七千册少年儿童读物，内容分为伟大祖国、自然科学、战斗故事、童话、少年儿童好品质的成长等五部分。在各陈列部分，用讲故事、演幻灯、作实验等等的方式，向观众进行了宣传。如在自然科学部分，队员们一面表演着有趣的物理实验，一面介绍着“物理世界的漫游”、“十万个为什么”。
    通过这次展览会，帮助教师、辅导员认识到现有的少年儿童书籍并没有充分运用起来。如有的辅导员说：“原来有这么多孩子们看的好书，我过去都不知道，回去一定给孩子们添购新书。”大家一致认为这个展览会是向少年儿童宣传书籍内容的一个很好的方式。在举办展览会的这一月份，新华书店多发行了一万七千册少年儿童读物。很多学校买到新书之后，也举行了以“和书交朋友”、“书是我们亲密的伴侣”等为主题的图书展览会。新书很快地在孩子们手上传递着。
    与此同时，团市委少年部向全市教师和辅导员提出，希望他们利用业余时间，多看些少年儿童读物。并要求中学专职少先队辅导员在举办天津市少年儿童图书展览会前后，每人必须看两本至三本少年儿童读物。大家这样做了。不少辅导员还写了阅读心得。有的辅导员检讨了自己不看少年儿童读物，给工作带来的损失。大家都认识到做为一个少年儿童教育工作者，应当很好地阅读和研究少年儿童读物，否则就不能帮助少年儿童选择书，更不能向少年儿童介绍书中最生动、富有教育意义的内容，使少年儿童从书中受到教育。这样就激发了辅导员指导少年儿童阅读的积极性，纠正了他们过去认为“少年儿童阅读，不是我的事，是图书馆的事”的错误看法。
    在大力宣传少年儿童读物的时候，我们同新华书店取得了密切的联系，改进了少年儿童读物的推销办法。新华书店负责编印各种新到的少年儿童图书目录，并附简单的说明，发到各校，帮助教师、辅导员及时了解新华书店新到的少年儿童读物。此外，为了满足读者的需要，防止脱销，还采取了一些新的办法：重点推荐少年儿童读物，并实行预购，即由团市委、教育局联合拟定推荐少年儿童读物的通知，发至各校，由学校行政方面、教师和辅导员认真地向少年儿童进行宣传；新华书店同时发出重点书籍的预购单，新华书店根据预购的数字，准备足够供应的书籍。上半年为配合对小学六年级学生进行劳动教育，重点推荐的“韩梅梅”就采用了这个办法，结果全市共推销了二万一千册。其他如为了对少年儿童进行品质教育，在“六一”儿童节前后重点推荐的“这样说、这样做”、“和好”、“三个好朋友”、“和爸爸一起坐牢的日子里”，以及配合少先队积极大量的发展，重点推荐的“怎样做一个少先队员”等也都采用了这个办法，效果很好。
    为了便于各校给少年儿童选购新书，团市委少年部帮助新华书店门市部组织了两次少年儿童读物陈列，邀请各校行政人员、图书馆管理员前去参观选购。老师、辅导员反映，这种作法对帮助他们选购书籍有很大作用。
    由于我们进行了以上的工作，孩子们买的书籍比以前显著地增多了。据新华书店少年儿童图书部统计，一九五四年十二月到一九五五年六月，少年儿童读物的发行数比一九五三年十二月到一九五四年六月增加了九万多册。六区十四小学，一九五四年仅有少年儿童读物四百三十六册，现在已有一千一百八十四册，增加了七百四十八册。新书买到学校以后，孩子们都高兴地围上去问：什么时候能借我们看呀！有的提出：“我来贴书号吧！”过去不爱看书的孩子，在少年先锋队的教育下，现在也养成了阅读的习惯。过去一些爱看神怪、荒诞书籍的孩子们，现在也被“孙悟空”、“岳飞抗金兵”等书籍吸引住，再也不看那些坏书了。
