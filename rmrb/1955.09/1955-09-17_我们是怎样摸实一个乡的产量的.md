    How We Accurately Assessed the Output of a Township
    Yun Cheng, You Dong

    Accurately assessing output is a prerequisite for doing a good job of fixing production. Only when the output is accurately assessed can we have a clear understanding of the assessment, can the production be fixed accurately, and can the entire "Three Fixes" work have a reliable foundation.

    The process of fixing production in Diwang Township, Sixth District, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, was as follows:

    I. Continue ideological and policy education for cadres and the masses. Although the "Three Fixes" policy for grain has undergone the first stage of publicity and education, cadres and the masses have a certain degree of understanding of the policy, people's hearts are stable, production enthusiasm is high, and they have confidence in mutual aid and cooperation, they are still generally concerned about the level of output and their personal interests. They reflected, "The policy is excellent, but it depends on how it is implemented!" "Saying it's good doesn't count, doing it well counts." Generally, they were afraid that the output would be set too high, requiring them to sell more surplus grain, so many farmers were not telling the truth and wanted to conceal their output. Some grassroots workers were also afraid that "telling the truth would lead to the masses scolding them," so they had the idea of "reporting lower output to make the task easier to complete." In response to this situation, the township started with educating cadres and the masses. On the one hand, it used various propaganda tools to repeatedly and comprehensively explain the policy. On the other hand, it specifically and centrally explained the role and specific methods of fixing production, explaining the reasons behind it, so that everyone could correct their ideological understanding. At the same time, it repeatedly explained to grassroots workers that this year is the first year of implementing the "Three Fixes" policy. Once production and procurement are fixed, they will remain unchanged for three years. Doing a good or bad job will not only affect this year's grain work but will also affect the work in the next few years. After such specific and repeated explanations, the awareness of cadres and the masses was greatly improved, their concerns were eliminated, and their attitude was corrected, quickly opening up the situation. Farmer Chen Zhiyuan said: "The output must be fixed reasonably. If it is fixed too low, the state will not be able to purchase grain, the state will be in trouble, the people will suffer, rich peasants and unscrupulous merchants will hoard and speculate, and counter-revolutionaries will take the opportunity to sabotage. Only when the output is fixed reasonably will it be beneficial to both the state and the people." Therefore, in general, they were able to tell the truth and reveal their true feelings, reporting their actual output. Qi Cunde, the deputy village chief of Diwang Village, was initially afraid of being scolded by the masses and that a high output would mean a large task. He reported the output of Qi Shutang, who was engaged in mutual aid production with him, as nine dou instead of one shi and two dou, saying, "This is the highest output in the whole village." After education, he consciously reviewed his previous erroneous thinking and corrected the original reported output. The masses in Chenjiatai Village originally unanimously reflected that the average output of each grade of land was five or six dou per mu. Later, they corrected it to eight or nine dou, which was basically close to the actual output.

    II. From within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, rely on the strength of activists to gradually go deeper and understand and grasp the actual output of various grades and types of crops this year and in previous years from all aspects. Although the staff has grasped some information on the actual output through the previous stage of work, in order to make the output grasped comprehensively and reliably, it is necessary to further specifically and deeply understand. In addition to understanding the rate of increase in production and the farming conditions of various types of crops in general years, we should also focus on understanding the actual output of summer crops this year, and then add the estimated output of autumn crops to determine the initial production opinions, and finally, according to the actual output of previous years, to verify whether the initially determined output is reasonable and accurate. For example, in conversations and interviews, we learned that Chen Jianxiong, the deputy village chief of Chenjiatai Village, actually produced thirty-six shi of summer grain on forty mu of summer fields (dry land, thirty-four mu of second-grade land, and six mu of fourth-grade land) this year, averaging nine dou per mu; in 1953, thirty-eight mu of summer fields (dry land, thirty-two mu of second-grade land, and six mu of fourth-grade land) actually produced thirty-five shi, averaging nine dou and two sheng per mu; in 1954, thirty-eight mu (the land grade was the same as in 1953) actually produced more than forty shi, averaging more than one shi per mu. The average area and output of summer fields over the three years is still nine dou (the same method is used to understand the output of autumn fields). Therefore, it proves that the output determined by adding the actual output of summer fields this year to the estimated output of autumn fields can represent the general normal years. Based on these materials, educating the grassroots workers quickly grasped the actual production situation.

    III. In this township, first-grade land accounts for 85.8 percent of the area of irrigated grain crops, and second-grade land accounts for 61.5 percent of the area of dryland grain crops. Therefore, when fixing production, first determine the output of these two grades of land, and then determine the output of each grade of land based on the actual output of each grade of land this year, with reference to the difference in output of each grade of land during the land survey and production determination, as well as the actual output, increase rate, and potential of each grade of land in previous years. For example, the actual output of third-grade irrigated land has been close to that of first-grade irrigated land for several years, and some are even equivalent to that of first-grade land. Therefore, when determining the output of third-grade irrigated land, the difference from first-grade land was reduced. During the land survey and production determination, the output of third-grade irrigated land only accounted for 86 percent of that of first-grade land, and the output of this production determination is equivalent to 89 percent of that of first-grade land. Another example is that farmers who own third-grade dry land generally have good land and invest less in third-grade land, and the rate of increase in production has been slow in previous years. Therefore, this production determination only increased by 38 percent compared with the land survey and production determination; while farmers who own fourth-grade dry land generally have less good land and invest more in fourth-grade land, and the rate of increase in production has been fast and the output has been high in previous years. Therefore, the production determination increased by 48 percent compared with the land survey and production determination. In this way, the output of each grade of land is determined, and after repeated comparisons in conjunction with the actual situation, the output determined for each grade of land is basically in line with the actual situation.

    IV. After grasping the output of each grade of land, in order to further verify the accuracy of these outputs, the following three accounts were also calculated:

    (1) Calculate the account of the comparison between the total number of fixed production in the whole township and the total number of actual production (the area of autumn fields is still calculated according to the planned area) to see if the fixed production is reasonable. According to the initially determined output of each grade of land, the total fixed output of the township is 1,928,008 jin. If calculated according to the actual output of summer and autumn fields in the whole township (the output of autumn fields is estimated according to the planned area), the total output can be 2,023,389 jin. The fixed production accounts for more than 95 percent of the actual production. Therefore, the determined output does not exceed the actual output.

    (2) Calculate the account of the relationship between fixed production and the control indicators for fixed purchase and fixed sales. The fixed production of the whole township is 1,928,008 jin. After deducting 400,000 jin of public grain, 221,088 jin of feed and seeds, and 1,059,090 jin of food grain, there is an actual surplus of 247,830 jin. This can not only ensure the completion of the national grain purchase task of 200,000 jin but also have a surplus. In terms of unified sales, the district has allocated 110,000 jin to the whole township. According to the current situation, 60,000 jin is enough for unified sales. Therefore, in terms of unified sales, not only will the target not be broken, but the state's sales volume can also be reduced by 50,000 jin.

    (3) Calculate the account of the grain left to the farmers after the requisition and purchase. The actual output of summer fields and the estimated output according to the planned area of autumn fields in the whole township is 2,023,389 jin of grain. However, because the actual sown area of autumn fields is larger than the planned area, the total output can actually reach 2,186,545 jin. According to this calculation, the requisition and purchase task of the whole township only accounts for 27.4 percent of this actual output. If the amount of grain requisitioned and purchased by the state is deducted from the actual output, the average amount of grain left to each person in the whole township is 638 jin. If feed and seeds are deducted, the average net amount of food grain left to each person is 538 jin. This amount of grain is not only enough to eat but also has a lot of surplus.

    By calculating the above three accounts, it can be seen that the fixed production figures grasped by this township are basically in line with the actual situation. It can not only guarantee the needs of the state and complete and exceed the national grain requisition and purchase tasks but also protect the interests of farmers and can further improve the production enthusiasm of farmers and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

专栏：把粮食“三定”政策贯彻到户

    我们是怎样摸实一个乡的产量的
    云呈  佑东
    摸实产量，是做好定产工作的先决条件。只有产量摸实了，评产才能心中有数，定产才能定得确实，全部“三定”工作，也才能有可靠的基础。
    陕西咸阳县六区帝王乡的定产过程是这样进行的：
    一、继续向干部、群众进行思想教育和政策教育。虽然粮食“三定”政策经过第一阶段的宣传、教育，干部和群众对政策有了一定程度的理解，人心安定了，生产情绪高涨了，对互助合作有了信心，但总还是关心产量的高低，关心个人的切身利益。他们反映说：“政策好极了，就看咋做呀！”“说好不算好，做好才算好。”普遍怕产量定得高，要多卖余粮，因之不少农民不讲实话，想隐瞒产量。一些基层工作人员也怕“说了实话群众骂”，便存着“低报产量，任务好完成”的想法。根据这一情况，这个乡就从教育干部、群众入手，一方面利用各种宣传工具，反复全面地交代政策，一方面针对干部、群众的思想顾虑，具体、集中地讲解定产的作用和具体定法，说明道理，使得大家端正思想认识。同时对基层工作人员反复说明：今年实行
  “三定”政策是第一年，定产、定购后，又要在三年内不变动，工作做好做坏，不单会影响今年粮食工作，而且关系到今后几年的工作。经过这样具体、反复的讲解，大大提高了干部、群众的觉悟，消除了顾虑，端正了态度，很快地打开了局面。农民陈治元说：“产量一定要定得合理，定低了国家购不到粮食，国家作难，人民吃亏，富农、奸商囤积倒把，剥削农民，反革命分子也会趁机破坏。只有产量定合理了，对国家对人民才都有利。”所以一般的都能说实话，露真情，报实产量。帝王村副村长戚存德开始就怕群众骂，怕产量大了任务多，把同自己一起互助生产的戚树唐的产量，由一石二斗报成九斗，并说：“这是全村的最高产量”。经过教育后，自觉地检讨了先前的错误思想，纠正了原报产量。陈家台村群众，原先一致反映各等地的产量平均每亩产五、六斗，后来就纠正为八、九斗，基本上接近实际产量。
    二、从党内到党外，从干部到群众，依靠积极分子的力量，逐步深入，从各方面了解和掌握今年和历年各等各类作物的实际产量。经过前一阶段的工作，工作人员固然掌握了一些实际产量的情况，但为使产量掌握得全面、可靠，就得进一步具体深入了解。除应再了解一般历年各等土地的增产速度和各类作物的作务情况外，还应着重了解今年夏田的实产量，然后加上秋田的估产，确定出初步定产意见，最后再根据历年实产情况，对证初定产量是否合理、准确。如在交谈、访问中知道陈家台村副村长陈建熊今年四十亩夏田（旱地，二等的三十四亩，四等的六亩）共实产三十六石夏粮，每亩平均九斗；一九五三年夏田三十八亩（旱地、二等的三十二亩，四等的六亩）实产三十五石，每亩平均九斗二；一九五四年三十八亩（地等和一九五三年同）实产四十多石，每亩平均一石多。三年夏田面积和产量平均，仍是九斗（秋田产量同样用这个办法了解）。因此，证明按今年夏田实产加上秋田估产，定出的产量是能够代表一般正常年景的。根据这些材料，再教育基层工作人员，就很快地掌握了实产情况。
    三、这个乡水地粮食作物面积中，一等地占百分之八十五点八，旱地粮食作物面积中，二等地占百分之六十一点五。因此在定产时先确定这两等土地的产量，再根据各等土地今年实产量，参照查田定产时各等产量的差额，以及历年各等土地实产、增产速度和潜力，确定出各等土地的产量。如三等水地几年来实产量已接近一等水地产量，有些还相等于一等的产量，因此在确定三等水地的产量时，减低了同一等地的差额。查田定产时，三等水地产量只占一等的百分之八十六，这次定产的产量已相当于一等的百分之八十九。又如占有三等旱地的农民一般都有好地，对三等地加工少，历年来增产速度慢，因此，这次定产比查田定产时仅加成百分之三十八；而占有四等旱地的农民由于一般好地少，对四等地加工多，历年来增产的速度快、产量高，因此定产比查田定产时加成百分之四十八。这样定出各等土地的产量，再结合实际情况，反复比较，各等土地所定产量，基本上切合实际。
    四、在各等土地产量掌握后，为了进一步证实这些产量的准确程度，还算了以下三笔账：
    （1）算全乡定产的总数同实产总数（秋田面积仍按计划面积算）对比的账，看定产是否合理。全乡按各等土地初定产量，共定产为一百九十二万八千零八斤。如果按全乡夏秋田实产（秋田按计划面积产量估算）共可产二百零二万三千三百八十九斤。定产占实产的百分之九十五多。因此，所定产量不超过实际产量。
    （2）算定产同定购、定销控制指标关系的账。全乡定产为一百九十二万八千零八斤，除去公粮四十万斤，饲料、籽种二十二万一千零八十八斤，口粮一百零五万九千零九十斤，实有余粮二十四万七千八百三十斤。这不但可以保证完成国家购粮任务的二十万斤，而且还有剩余。在统销方面，区上分配全乡十一万斤，根据现在掌握的情况，统销六万斤左右就够了，因而在统销方面，不但不突破指标，而且还可减少国家销量五万斤。
    （3）算征、购后给农民所留粮食的账。全乡夏田实产和按秋田计划面积估产，共产粮食二百零二万三千三百八十九斤。但由于秋田实种面积大于计划面积，所以总产量实际可以达到二百一十八万六千五百四十五斤，照这样算来，全乡征、购任务只占这个实产数量的百分之二十七点四。如果在实产内扣除国家征、购的粮食数量，全乡每人平均留粮数量就有六百三十八斤，如果再扣除饲料、籽种，每人平均净留口粮就有五百三十八斤。这个留粮数量不但够吃，而且还有很多剩余。
    通过算上面三笔账，可以看出这个乡掌握的定产数字基本上是切合实际的。它不但能够保证国家的需要，完成并超额完成国家征购粮食任务，而且能保障农民的利益，可以进一步提高农民的生产积极性和巩固工农联盟。（原载陕西日报）
