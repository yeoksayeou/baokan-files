    More Discussion of Ideological Issues
    ——Experience of the Party Branch of the Second Workshop of the 53rd Factory in Holding a Good Meeting of Party Members (2)

    Party member meetings in enterprises are different from various production meetings. They do not only discuss production issues, and even less so only technical issues in production. The party member meeting is the highest leading body of the party's primary organizations and a school for the party to conduct ideological education for party members. Therefore, the issues discussed at the party member meeting should be diverse and rich, and the discussion of ideological issues is the main content of the party member meeting.
    The Second Workshop Branch of the 53rd Factory has made certain efforts to enrich the agenda of the party member meeting. They did not, like some enterprise party branches, turn the party member meeting into a general production meeting, only discussing the key production issues of each month. From January to June 15th of this year, the Second Workshop Branch held twelve party member meetings. The topics of these twelve meetings were relatively diverse, including criticizing arrogance and complacency in formulating and implementing production plans; examining ideological problems in carrying out labor emulation; criticizing bourgeois decadent ideas in personal life; discussing the initiative of party members in their work; and examining the organizational discipline of party members. These topics touched on various ideological issues with educational significance in the production, work, party life, and daily life of party members, playing a role in educating all party members.
    Some branches believe that since the Party should guarantee the completion of production tasks, the party member meeting should directly discuss production issues and need not discuss other issues. The experience of the Second Workshop Branch negates this view. Undoubtedly, the branch should be concerned about production issues, and major production issues should be discussed at the party member meeting. However, the branch should also be concerned about other aspects, such as the various ideological issues reflected in the daily lives of party members. Can it be said that discussing the ideological problems in the lives of party members has no connection with guaranteeing production? No. The Second Workshop Branch is very concerned about the personal lives of party members, because if life problems are not handled well, they often directly affect the production mood of party members. For example, probationary party member Xin Zhanhai did not perform well in production. After the branch investigated, it turned out that he often quarreled with his wife and often hit her because his wife "did not serve him well." Because he had problems in his personal life, it affected his production mood. There were also individual party members who engaged in speculative buying and selling or had improper relationships between men and women, and they were also backward in production. The sixth party member meeting this year took the elimination of the influence of bourgeois ideology as its topic, and through the above-mentioned examples, conducted a class education for all party members. With the improvement of the ideological level of party members, not only did those party members who made mistakes improve in production, but the enthusiasm of all party members to overcome various difficulties in production also increased. This laid the ideological foundation for solving the key production problems of each period. Now the Second Workshop can overfulfill the product quality indicators every month. From May of last year to May of this year, the good product rate increased by 4.24 percentage points. This is the role that the Party organization plays in promoting economic work through party member meetings and other political and ideological work.
    So, where does the party branch find ideological problems?
    The Second Workshop Branch believes that ideological problems should be found among the workers and in the actual work of the Party. In the process of implementing the Party's resolutions, in participating in various workshop meetings, in listening to the reports of mass organizations such as the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and in individual conversations with the masses, ideological problems can be discovered at any time from the production, study, and life of staff and workers.
    Let's look at a few examples of how the Second Workshop Branch discovered ideological problems.
    The pilot work of economic accounting in the Second Workshop began in early May this year. Some key members of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League participated in the study of accounting methods. However, from staff to workers, the enthusiasm for implementing the economic accounting system was generally not high. What was the problem?
    At a reporting meeting on the pilot work of economic accounting, Branch Secretary Lü Decai found that various functional groups had an attitude of "impatience" and "irrelevance" towards implementing the economic accounting system. For example, the materials group used to have no strict control over the materials and tools received by each workshop. Now they have to fill out a card for the receipt situation every day, and they find it troublesome. Also, the staff of the technical group said that they did not understand any indicators other than technical indicators, so economic accounting was not their business. The branch secretary paid attention to these ideological situations.
    Subsequently, the branch further discovered ideological problems among staff and workers through individual conversations and work reports. Communist Party member Lin Xiyuan went to the branch secretary and requested a transfer, unwilling to work as a foreman. He said, "I am old, have poor memory, and have a low level of education. From now on, all work must be accounted for. It is better to transfer a young person to do it!" Obviously, he had no confidence in implementing the economic accounting system. At the same time, according to the information obtained from the Communist Youth League and the trade union, workers generally had the idea of "public accounting, not personal accounting."
    There were incorrect views on economic accounting. This was a common phenomenon. The branch committee decided to seize this issue for further in-depth research. The branch committee held a symposium with the participation of staff and workers to let the participants talk about their views on implementing economic accounting. This symposium further confirmed that party members and the masses did have the above-mentioned ideological problems. After the symposium, the branch committee members contacted the masses individually to understand their ideological situation in detail. Worker Luan Yonghai said to the branch secretary during the conversation: "I always thought that I only manage the machine and don't care about accounting. No matter how you calculate, you won't calculate two more machines." This represents the attitude of many workers towards implementing the economic accounting system.
    Through the symposium and in-depth contact with the masses, the branch committee determined that the objective difficulties in implementing the economic accounting system could be overcome, but the problem lay in ideology. There was insufficient understanding of the significance of economic accounting within and outside the Party, and the concept of cherishing national property had not been universally established. This was the main ideological problem at present. Therefore, solving these ideological problems not only immediately became the center of the branch's daily propaganda work, but also became the topic of a party member meeting at the end of May.
    The Second Workshop Branch also studied the problems that occurred in production at any time, and was good at discovering ideological problems through technical problems. For example, in the first week of March this year, they found from the statistics that the quality of workshop products had dropped by another 0.4%; looking back at the statistics for the previous months, they found that the quality in the first ten days of each month was declining, but not as much as in March. One work section had the most serious decline, with special waste (the most serious defect) accounting for 40% of the total special waste in the entire workshop. So the branch committee members went to this work section to investigate and found that from the foreman to the workers, this work section attributed the defective products to technical reasons. They said that in February they had just started "multi-machine tending" (one worker managing two machines), the workers were not yet proficient, and some new workers had come, so defective products were inevitable. Was this really the case? The branch committee members made an in-depth understanding of this issue and found that although technical unfamiliarity due to multi-machine tending was an objective reason for the decline in product quality, the basic reason was ideological. They compared the labor attitude of Yang Chongxian, an advanced worker who had never produced defective products, with the labor attitude of Zheng Haifeng, who had the most special waste, and saw the problem. Advanced worker Yang Chongxian concentrated on his work. His hand was working on this machine, and at the same time he was listening to the sound of that machine with his ears; when operating on that machine, he also paid attention to the movement of this machine. In this way, since he took care of two machines, he had never produced defective products or damaged the machines. Zheng Haifeng was not like this. He thought about other things in his mind when he worked, so he produced six special wastes in a row in March. It can be seen that emphasizing technical reasons is actually looking for excuses for the incorrect labor attitudes of some workers. Isn't this ideology at work? The branch committee also found that this kind of thinking was not individual. For example, the inspection workers also believed that it was inevitable to produce defective products when implementing multi-machine tending. Therefore, criticizing this irresponsible attitude towards product quality became one of the topics of the seventh party member meeting of this workshop.
    Ideological problems must be found after the party branch has grasped the situation and conducted a full analysis and research. Party members in various work sections of the Second Workshop often had disputes over the issue of defective product reimbursement, especially between work sections with two consecutive processes. Whenever there were defective products, one work section would say that the other work section mixed the incompletely processed products into the processed products, thus causing the defective products; while the other work section did not admit its mistake, saying that the first work section should pick out these incompletely processed products, otherwise they would not be responsible. Once, the foremen of these two work sections even argued about this matter to the technician for judgment. The branch conducted an investigation and study on this issue. During the investigation, it was found that the party members and the masses in these two work sections had such an attitude towards defective products; they did not seriously study and investigate the causes of defective products, but were only busy shirking responsibility. If one party reimburses defective products, the other party feels safe and sound. This attitude shows that party members and the masses in various work sections generally have an irresponsible attitude towards defective products, attempting to push the responsibility for defective products to others, and lack a proactive and responsible work attitude. This is the essence of the problem. Obviously, this kind of thinking not only hinders the joint efforts of various work sections to eliminate defective products, but also causes disunity between various work sections. This is certainly an ideological problem worth discussing. Therefore, examining the initiative of party members in their work and criticizing the departmentalism of shirking responsibility became the topic of the ninth party member meeting this year.
    Over the past year or so, the Second Workshop Branch has taken the above-mentioned measures and achieved certain results in improving the ideological nature of the topics of the party member meeting, which should be affirmed. However, these achievements are still preliminary. To further improve the quality of the party member meeting, it is also necessary to educate party members to grasp the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method, grasp the principles of the Party, and enable them to correctly analyze and solve problems through the discussion of ideological issues. To achieve this step, it is certainly not enough to rely solely on going deep into reality to discover problems. First of all, the leading comrades of the branch themselves are required to study modestly, improve their Marxist-Leninist level, enrich their theoretical knowledge of the Party, and be familiar with the Party's various policies. The Second Workshop Branch has not done enough in this regard. Therefore, this should be the main direction of their efforts.

    多讨论思想问题
    ——五三工厂二车间党支部开好党员大会的经验之二
    陈星
    企业中党员大会和各种生产会议不同，它并不只讨论生产问题，更不是只去讨论生产中许多技术性的问题。党员大会是党的基层组织的最高领导机关，也是党对党员进行思想教育的学校，因此，党员大会讨论的问题应该是多样的、丰富的，而讨论思想问题则是党员大会的主要内容。
    五三厂二车间支部在充实党员大会议题方面作了一定的努力，他们不像有些企业党支部那样几乎把党员大会变成了一般的生产会议，光去讨论每月的生产关键问题。今年一月到六月十五日，二车间支部召开了十二次党员大会，这十二次大会的议题内容是比较多样的，其中有批判制定和执行生产计划中骄傲自满情绪的；有检查开展劳动竞赛中思想问题的；有批判个人生活中资产阶级腐化思想的；有讨论党员工作中主动性问题的；有检查党员的组织性和纪律性问题的。这些议题比较广泛地接触到党员生产、工作、党的生活和日常生活中各种富有教育意义的思想问题，使党员大会起了教育全体党员的作用。
    有些支部认为党既然要保证生产任务的完成，那末党员大会应该直接讨论生产问题，不必讨论其他问题，二车间支部的经验否定了这种说法。毫无疑问，支部应该关心生产问题，在党员大会上应该讨论重大的生产问题，但支部也应该关心其他方面的问题，如党员日常生活中反映出来的各种思想问题。能不能说讨论党员生活中的思想问题对保证生产就没有关系了呢？不是的。二车间支部十分关心党员的个人生活，这因为生活问题处理不好，往往直接影响到党员的生产情绪。例如，候补党员信占海，生产成绩不好，支部了解结果，原来是他经常同老婆吵架，好多次因老婆“侍候不周”就动手打她。正因为他在个人生活上有问题，所以影响到了他的生产情绪。还有个别党员私下做投机买卖或发生不正当的男女关系等，在生产上也是落后的。今年第六次党员大会就以清除资产阶级思想的影响为议题，通过上列一些事例，对全体党员进行了一次阶级教育。随着党员思想水平的提高，不但那些犯错误的党员在生产上有了好转，全体党员克服生产中各种困难的积极性也提高了。这就给解决各时期生产关键问题打下了思想基础。现在二车间每月都能超额完成产品质量指标。去年五月份到今年五月份良品率提高了百分之四点二四，这就是党组织通过党员大会及其他各项政治思想工作对经济工作所起的推动作用。
    那末，党支部从哪里去找思想问题呢？
    二车间党支部认为，思想问题应该到工人群众中去找，到党的实际工作中去找。支部在贯彻党的决议过程中，在参加车间各种会议中，在听取工会、青年团等群众组织的汇报中，在同群众个别谈话中，从工作人员、工人的生产、学习和生活中，随时都可以发现思想问题。
    我们看看二车间支部发现思想问题的几个例子。
    二车间的经济核算的试点工作今年五月初就开始了，党政工团的一些骨干分子都参加了核算方法的学习；但从工作人员到工人，对执行经济核算制劲头普遍不大，问题在那里呢？
    在一次经济核算试点工作汇报会议上，支部书记吕德才发现各职能组对贯彻经济核算制有“不耐烦”和“与己无关”的情绪。例如材具组，过去各车间领用材料工具没有严格的控制，现在每天都要填写领用情况的卡片，他们就嫌麻烦；又如技术组的工作人员，说他们除技术指标外，别的指标根本不懂，因此，经济核算工作不是他们的事。支部书记注意了这些思想情况。
    接着，支部在个别谈话和在工作汇报中进一步发现了工作人员和工人中的思想问题。共产党员林锡元去找支部书记，要求调动工作，不愿作工长，他说：“我年纪大了，记忆力差，文化水平又低，今后什么工作都要核算，不如调一个青年来干吧！”显然，他对执行经济核算制没有信心。同时从青年团、工会等方面了解的情况来看，工人中普遍有“公家核算，个人不核算”的思想。
    对经济核算有不正确的看法，这是普遍的现象。支委会决定抓住这个问题作深入一步的研究。支委会召开了一个有工作人员和工人参加的座谈会，让与会者谈谈对贯彻经济核算的看法。这次座谈会进一步证实党员和群众确实有上述思想问题。开了座谈会，支部委员又分别同群众个别接触，细致地了解群众的思想情况。工人栾永海在同支部书记谈话的时候说：“我一直以为自己只管机器，不管算帐，你怎么算，也不会多算出两台机器来。”这正代表着许多工人对贯彻执行经济核算制的态度。
    通过座谈会，通过同群众的深入接触，支委会断定：贯彻执行经济核算制的客观困难是可以克服的，问题是在思想方面。党内党外对经济核算的意义认识不足，爱护国家财产的观念还没有普遍确立，这是当前主要的思想问题。于是解决这些思想问题不但立即成为支部日常宣传工作的中心，并且成为五月末一次党员大会的议题。
    二车间支部还随时研究生产中发生的问题，善于透过技术问题来发现思想问题。如今年三月第一周，他们从统计表上发现：车间产品质量又下降了千分之四；再翻翻前几个月的统计表，发现每月上旬的质量都是下降的，但没有三月份降得多，有一个工段降得最厉害，特废（最严重的废品）占全车间特废的百分之四十。于是支部委员到这个工段去调查，发现这个工段从工长到工人都把出废品归之于技术原因，他们说，二月份刚开始“多机台看管”（一个工人管理两台机器），工人还不熟练，又来了些新工人，出废品是不可避免的。果真是这样吗？支部委员就这一问题作了深入的了解，才发现因多机台看管而技术不熟练虽是造成产品质量下降的一个客观原因，但基本原因是在思想方面。他们把这个工段从来没有出过废品的杨崇先的劳动态度和特废出得最多的郑海峰的劳动态度对比一下，就看出了问题所在。先进工人杨崇先全神贯注地进行工作，他手在这台机器上干活，同时又用耳朵听那台机器的声音；在那台机器上操作时，他同样注意这台机器的动静。这样，他自从看管两台机器后，从没有出过废品，也没有损坏过机器。而郑海峰不是这样，他工作时脑中想着别的事，所以三月份一连出了六次特废。由此可见，强调技术原因实际上是替某些工人不正确的劳动态度找借口。难道这不是思想在作怪吗？支委会又发现这种思想不是个别的，如检验工人也认为实行多机台看管，出废品是难免的。于是批判这种对产品质量不负责任的思想就成为这个车间第七次党员大会的议题之一。
    思想问题是要党支部掌握情况后经过充分的分析研究才能找到的。二车间各工段党员在废品报销问题上常发生争执，特别是有两个工序衔接的工段争执最多。每当有了废品，这一工段就说是那一工段把没有完全加工的产品混在加工的产品中，因此造成了废品；而那一工段不认错，说这一工段应该把这些未完全加工的产品挑选出来，否则他们不负责。有一次，这两个工段的工长甚至为这件事吵到技术员那里去评理。支部对这个问题进行了调查研究，在调查中发现这两个工段的党员和群众对废品都抱这样的态度；他们不去认真地研究和追查废品产生的原因，而只是忙于推卸责任。废品如有一方报销，另一方就感到安然无事。这种态度说明各工段党员和群众对废品普遍有不负责任的思想，企图把出废品的责任推给别人，而缺少一种主动负责的工作态度。这才是问题的本质。显然，这种思想不但阻碍各工段共同努力来消灭废品，而且会造成各工段之间的不团结。这当然是一个值得讨论的思想问题。于是检查党员在工作中的主动性，批判推卸责任的本位主义思想，就成为今年第九次党员大会的议题。
    一年多来，二车间党支部采取上述办法，在提高党员大会议题的思想性方面取得了一定成绩，这是应该肯定的。但这些成绩还是初步的。要进一步提高党员大会的质量，还必须通过思想问题的讨论，教育党员掌握马克思列宁主义的观点和方法，掌握党的原则，使他们能够正确地去分析问题、解决问题。要达到这一步，单依靠深入实际发现问题当然是不够的，首先要求支部领导同志本身虚心学习，提高马克思列宁主义水平，充实党的理论知识，熟悉党的各项政策。二车间党支部这方面做得还不够，因此，这应该是他们努力的主要方向。
