    Economic Survey Begins in the Tarim River Basin
    A comprehensive economic survey team is conducting a survey along the Tarim River in southern Xinjiang, China's largest inland river. This survey team is jointly organized by the Xinjiang Provincial Transportation, Water Conservancy, Wasteland Survey, and Geology units, including more than 40 technical cadres in navigation, water conservancy, geology, wasteland survey, and other fields. Most of them are collecting data on the future development of industry, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the Tarim River basin by traveling on two wooden boats equipped with "engines," while a few are on horseback. It is expected that by November of this year, they will complete the survey work from Aksu County in the west to Tieganlike in Yuli County in the east, a total length of about 1,500 li.
    The upper reaches of the Tarim River are formed by the confluence of the Hotan River, Yarkand River, Kashgar River, and Aksu River, flowing eastward into Lop Nur. It is China's largest inland river. Most of the areas along the river are sparsely populated, with fertile wasteland and grasslands, and many places are densely covered with mulberry forests or wild hemp. It is the first time in history that a comprehensive survey has been conducted in this area. (Xinhua News Agency)

    塔里木河流域开始经济调查
    一支综合经济调查队正沿着中国最大的内陆河——新疆南部塔里木河，进行调查。这支调查队是由新疆省交通、水利、荒地勘测、地质等单位联合组织的，包括航务、水利、地质、荒地调查等技术干部四十多人。他们当中大部分人乘着两只装置着“发动机”的木船，少部分人骑马，沿河搜集今后发展塔里木河流域工业、交通、农林、畜牧业经济的有关资料，预计在今年十一月间，将完成西起阿克苏县东至尉犁县铁干里克全长约一千五百里的调查工作。
    塔里木河上游是汇合和阗河、叶尔羌河、喀什噶尔河、阿克苏河而成的，东流入罗布泊，是中国最大的内陆河，沿岸大部地方人烟稀少，有一片肥沃的荒地和草原，很多地方密密地长着桑林或野麻。在这个地区进行综合性的调查，还是有史以来的第一次。　（新华社）
