    Demobilized Soldiers Should Pay Attention to Keeping Military Secrets
    To the Editor:
    Not long ago, I met a Comrade Liu from the Chuxian Grain Bureau at the Chengxi Township People's Committee in Chuxian. This Comrade Liu is a demobilized soldier, young and enthusiastic, and likes to talk to others, often introducing the life of the army to others. Of course, it is good to introduce the general life of the army to the people and let them increase their understanding of the People's Army. But the bad thing is: he casually said many things that should not be said, such as the location of the troops and the performance of weapons.
    With the implementation of the compulsory military service system, a certain number of soldiers will be discharged or transferred to the reserve every year in the future. If they casually talk about the internal situation of the troops to others, it will create opportunities for hidden enemies to steal state military secrets. Therefore, I suggest that demobilized soldiers and future veterans should not casually talk about many things in the army that should not be known to the general public. At the same time, relevant departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army should also educate soldiers who are about to be demobilized or transferred to keep state military secrets, so as to avoid causing leakage incidents.

### 复员军人应注意保守军事机密

    复员军人应注意保守军事机密编辑同志：
    不久前，我在滁县城西乡乡人民委员会碰到了滁县粮食局一位姓刘的同志。这位刘同志是一个复员军人，年青热情，欢喜和别人谈话，经常向别人介绍部队生活情况。当然，向人民群众介绍部队的一般生活情况，使他们增进对人民军队的了解，这是很好的。但是不好的是：他把部队驻地、武器性能等许多不应该说的情况也随便说了。
    随着义务兵役制的推行，以后每年都要有一定数量的军人退役或转为预备役。如果他们把部队内部情况随便对别人乱说，就给暗藏的敌人盗窃国家军事机密造成机会。因此，我建议复员军人和今后的退役军人不要把部队里许多不应该让一般人了解的情况随便乱说，同时中国人民解放军有关部门也应该对将要复员转业的军人进行保守国家军事机密的教育，以免造成泄密事件。
