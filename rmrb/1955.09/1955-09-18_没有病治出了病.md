    Illness Caused by Treatment When There Was No Illness
    To the Editor:
        I am a twenty-three-year-old youth who used to work in the Party General Branch Committee office of the Haolianghe Lumber Mill in the Yichun Forestry Area. Now, I am in a sanatorium because of illness. The reason for my illness is very strange; it is not due to any other reason, but simply because I believed the doctor's "diagnosis" and accepted the doctor's "treatment."
        In the past, I was generally healthy and had not suffered from any illnesses. After May 1953, I often suffered from insomnia, as well as night sweats and pain in my ribs. Suspecting that I had lung disease, I went to the factory's clinic for an examination. Dr. Jiang Weizeng of the clinic listened to my complaints and examined me with a stethoscope, then announced the diagnosis – "pulmonary infiltration and pleurisy."
        Pulmonary infiltration! Pleurisy! I was shocked. I could not believe that my condition was so serious. I requested to go to the Provincial Hospital of Jiamusi City for X-ray fluoroscopy and photography.
        "Alas! X-ray fluoroscopy and photography will damage your nerves, cells, and blood cells, worsen your condition, and may even prevent you from having children in the future," Dr. Jiang Weizeng dissuaded me with such words, and then said, "Whether you go or not, it's still lung disease; whether you go to the hospital or not, they may not give you streptomycin, but we can give you streptomycin." At the same time, he also told my superiors – the Party General Branch Secretary – that my lung disease was very serious, that I should not go to Jiamusi, and that the clinic could guarantee a cure...
        A patient should trust the doctor, so I began treatment at the clinic. Dr. Jiang Weizeng injected me with "streptomycin" and had me take "PAS" and "Rimifon" orally. He also prescribed "Barbital" for insomnia. From June 1953 to February of this year, I was treated for twenty months. I was injected with more than 150 doses of "streptomycin," and I took so much oral medication that I couldn't even count it all; but besides the insomnia being cured, in the summer of 1954, I developed many more symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue, and joint pain. At that time, Dr. Jiang Weizeng did not pay any attention to my condition. It wasn't until March of this year that he told me, "Your lung disease has worsened!"
        Because I lodged a strong protest, Dr. Jiang Weizeng had no choice but to refer me to the Provincial Hospital of Jiamusi City for treatment. After various examinations and consultations with four physicians at the Provincial Hospital, it was proven that my lungs were originally healthy, and that I didn't even have any old lesions; but I do have a disease now, called "streptomycin poisoning," which was caused by excessive injections of streptomycin.
        To the Editor: I was thus turned from having no illness to having an illness. Twenty months of "treatment" not only caused me great pain and affected my work, but also cost the state more than 500 yuan in medical expenses; and now, I still need to recuperate for a certain period of time, and the state will have to continue to pay medical expenses. I request that the relevant leading organs take action against Dr. Jiang Weizeng, who did not cure the disease but instead "created" a disease.

### 没有病治出了病

    没有病治出了病编辑同志：
    我是一个二十三岁的青年，原在伊春林区浩良河制材厂党总支委员会办公室工作。现在，我因为有病，正在疗养。我得病的原因很奇怪，不是因为别的什么缘故，而仅仅是因为相信了医生的“诊断”，接受了医生的“治疗”。
    过去，我身体还算健康，没闹过什么病。一九五三年五月以后，我经常失眠，还有盗汗、肋部发痛等迹象。我怀疑自己得了肺病，就到厂里的卫生所去检查。卫生所的姜渭增大夫听了我的主诉，又用听诊器给我检查了一下，就宣布诊断结果——“肺浸润和肋膜炎”。
    肺浸润！肋膜炎！我不觉大吃一惊。我不敢相信我的病情这样严重，我要求到佳木斯市省立病院去进行爱克斯光透视和摄影的检查。
    “唉！爱克斯光透视和摄影会使你神经、细胞和血球受到损害，病情加重，甚至今后不会生育。”姜渭增大夫用这样的说法来劝阻我，接着说：“你去也是肺病，不去也是肺病；去了医院也不一定给你打链霉素，不去咱们就可以给你打链霉素。”同时，他又对我的上级领导同志——党总支书记说，我的肺病很严重，千万别去佳木斯，在卫生所可以保证治好……。
    病人是应该信任医生的，我开始在卫生所治病了。姜渭增大夫给我注射“链霉素”，让我内服“皮爱斯”和“雷米风”，失眠时还叫吃“巴比通”。从一九五三年六月到今年二月，一直治了二十个月，我先后注射了一百五十多支“链霉素”，吃的内服药更是多得数也数不清了；但是除了失眠已经痊愈外，在一九五四年夏季反而增加了头疼、头昏、耳鸣、困倦和骨节疼等很多症状。当时姜渭增大夫对我这种情况毫不在意，直到今年三月才告诉我：“你的肺病加重了！”
    由于我提出了严重抗议，姜渭增大夫这时才无可奈何地把我介绍到佳木斯市省立病院治疗。经过省立病院各种检查和四位医师会诊，结果证明：原来我的肺部是健康的，甚至连陈旧性的病灶也没有；而我目前的确有了病，这病叫做“链霉素中毒症”，是因为注射链霉素过多而造成的。
    编辑同志：我就这样由没病治成了有病。二十个月的“治疗”，不但使我深受痛苦和影响工作，而且也使国家开支了五百多元的药费；而今后，我还需要疗养一定时间，国家还得继续支出医药费用。对于这个不是治病而是“制病”的姜渭增大夫，我要求有关领导机关加以处理。
