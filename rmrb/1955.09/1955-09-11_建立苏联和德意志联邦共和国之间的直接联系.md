    Establishing Direct Contact Between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
    Negotiations between the Soviet government delegation and the government delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany began in Moscow on the 9th. Bulganin and Adenauer each made statements at the meeting. On the 9th, Bulganin invited Adenauer and members of the West German government delegation to breakfast at the Kremlin. These negotiations, initiated by the Soviet government to normalize relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, have attracted attention not only from European countries but also from the entire world. Before the negotiations began, many people believed that these negotiations were of great significance to the cause of peace and security. West Germany paid particular attention to these negotiations. Eighty journalists from West Germany came to cover these negotiations. The broad masses of the people in West Germany realized that direct contact between West Germany and the Soviet Union, and the establishment of direct diplomatic, trade, and cultural ties, would be beneficial to themselves and to peace in Europe. The opening speech by Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and head of the Soviet government delegation, was deeply impressive. He convincingly explained that the establishment of normal relations based on mutual trust and mutual respect would eliminate obstacles on the road to cooperation between the Soviet Union and West Germany, thereby consolidating the security of the peoples of Europe. Objective observers feel that this contact could and should become the beginning of the establishment of normal and good relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany. Soviet public opinion has repeatedly exposed those foreign "observers" with ulterior motives who attempt to create an atmosphere as if the preconditions for the establishment of normal relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany are the issue of German reunification and the participation of a unified Germany in the Atlantic Alliance. Newspapers pointed out that the Soviet Union has always advocated the restoration of a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. The Paris Agreements created obstacles, and the issue of German reunification must be resolved by the Germans themselves, by East Germany and West Germany, on the basis of ensuring peace and security in Europe. Therefore, under the current conditions, the most important task of the negotiations is to resolve the issue of establishing direct diplomatic relations, trade relations, and cultural ties between the two countries.

    建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的直接联系
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联政府代表团同德意志联邦共和国政府代表团之间的谈判九日在莫斯科开始了。布尔加宁和阿登纳在会议上先后作了声明。布尔加宁在九日请了阿登纳和西德政府代表团团员在克里姆林宫早餐。这次由苏联政府创议的，为着使苏联和西德之间关系正常化的谈判，引起了不但欧洲国家甚至是全世界的重视。在谈判开始以前，许多人们都认为，这次谈判对于和平和安全事业有重大意义。西德对于这次谈判特别注意。由西德来采访这次谈判的记者有八十个。西德广大人们意识到了：西德同苏联直接来往，在外交、贸易和文化上发生直接联系，对于自己和欧洲和平都有好处。苏联政府代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的开幕词给人深刻的印象。他令人信服地说明了：基于相互信任和相互尊重的正常关系的建立，将会排除在苏联和西德之间合作的道路上的障碍，从而巩固欧洲各国人民的安全。客观的观察家觉得：这次接触可能而且应该成为苏联和西德之间建立正常良好关系的开端。苏联舆论一再揭露那些别有用心的外国“观察家”，他们企图制造一种空气，似乎苏联和西德建立正常关系的先决条件是德国统一问题和这个统一的德国参加大西洋联盟。报纸指出：苏联始终主张恢复德国的和平、民主和统一。巴黎协定造成了障碍，而且德国统一问题是要德国人自己，要东德和西德，要在保证欧洲和平和安全的基础上来解决的。所以在目前条件下，谈判的最主要任务是解决建立两国之间的直接的外交关系、贸易关系和文化联系问题。（十日）
