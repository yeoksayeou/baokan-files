    Twenty Months Without a Single Rejection
    Chen Ken

    Che Yaowu is an excellent young fitter in Nanjing. From April 1953 to December 1954 (he left his job at the end of 1954 to participate in study), he did not produce a single rejected or substandard product for twenty months, and completed and overfulfilled his tasks.

    In 1953, Che Yaowu was transferred to work in the tool workshop. Previously, he had been a repairman in another factory. On his first day in the workshop, he saw that the workshop was making new products. He thought this was great and that he would learn a lot of skills in the future. However, when the workshop director introduced the production situation to him, and mentioned that the quality requirements were very high, and that the tolerance for the most precise work could not be one-seventh of a hair's breadth, he became a little scared. He thought to himself, "I've never done this before, not even seen it. Can I handle such high requirements?"

    The foreman, Communist Party member Zhu Jinming, saw Che Yaowu's concerns at a glance. He said to Che Yaowu very gently, "Don't be afraid, we will study together in the future, and learn if we don't understand." This gave Che Yaowu a lot of courage. He thought that since his comrades were helping him, he would work carefully first.

    When Che Yaowu started working on the first batch of jobs, he was very cautious. Although this batch of jobs was relatively simple, he still read the blueprints carefully. Afraid that he wouldn't be sure after reading it himself, he asked other comrades clearly which side to process first and which side to process later, and then he filed it down stroke by stroke. Sure enough, the first batch of jobs was qualified, followed by the second and third batches. Che Yaowu was very happy these days, and an unhealthy idea flashed through his mind: "It's not that hard, they made it sound so tense." So when the fourth batch of jobs came to hand, he unfolded the blueprint, glanced at it roughly, put it in the drawer, and started working easily.

    The product was finished, and Che Yaowu measured the work and confidently took it to the inspector. The inspector looked at the blueprint again and again, measured the finished product again and again, and then slowly said unhappily:

    "Rejected! Comrade Che Yaowu."

    "What?" Che Yaowu was a little anxious, "According to the 2.5 specified in the blueprint, the size is not a bit off."

    "But the 2.5 on the blueprint is the radius, and you made it the diameter, which is half the size."

    Che Yaowu's face turned red to the roots of his ears, and his heart jumped wildly. That night, he couldn't sleep, and he thought a lot, remembering things from a few years ago:

    Che Yaowu entered the factory as an apprentice when he was twelve years old, which was before liberation. At that time, working in the factory made him dizzy with hunger all day long, and his legs were shaking. Once, Che Yaowu and the workers didn't leave the factory gate for three days and three nights. They were so hungry that they took some black beans to cook, but they happened to be caught by the foreman, who kicked over the pot, tore off the symbol, and wanted to fire him.

    Che Yaowu also remembered what his uncle had said to him on the first day after liberation. His uncle was also a worker, and Che Yaowu lived with him before liberation, and everyone was often hungry. As soon as liberation came, Che Yaowu received twenty catties of grain from the factory and took it home to cook a meal of dry rice. His uncle said while eating, "Yaowu, you must work hard in the future. The Communist Party treats us with ten feet of kindness, and we can't treat them with eight feet." Che Yaowu thought even more about the education the Party had given him over the years, especially the quality education he had often heard since entering the factory.

    Che Yaowu understood that now it was no longer a question of "us" and "them," or "ten feet" and "eight feet," but that "if a rejected product is produced, the progress of new product trial production will be delayed, and the completion of the national plan will be affected. This is a big deal!" The more he thought about it, the more upset he became.

    The next day, Che Yaowu felt as if he had done something wrong. When he saw people, he lowered his head. When he spoke to others, he felt ashamed and blushed. As soon as he entered the workshop, foreman Zhu Jinming helped Che Yaowu find the cause of the rejected product, and finally said kindly, "If you misread a word, you will have to scrap a batch of work. You can't be careless again in the future!" Che Yaowu was very moved. The foreman didn't tell him exactly where the root cause was, and he didn't say anything further, but he knew in his heart: "I can still do the work, but I made a mistake because I was complacent." So, he gritted his teeth secretly: "I will never do this again, no matter what, I won't let it be scrapped."

    From then on, before starting work, Che Yaowu always read the overall drawing, the sectional drawing, and the cutaway drawing clearly. However, it was okay if he didn't look carefully, but once he looked carefully, there were many problems. He didn't understand this, and he didn't understand that. He had to do some work, and look at the drawing for a while; look at the drawing for a while, and ask someone. "How awkward!" Che Yaowu thought, "Forget it, let's be sloppy, even eating, rice falls out." But when he picked up the file, a problem immediately appeared in front of him: "How many roads did this piece of material go through from mining to steelmaking, from blanking to processing, and how much labor did it cost! Besides, can I build socialism with rejected products?" Thinking of this, his heart pounded and his hands became weak. Go ask someone, but he was afraid that people would be annoyed. However, he couldn't see any annoyance from the enthusiastic and sincere help of his comrades. In particular, the production team leader (also the Party group leader) often went to his workbench to help with work, and the workshop also specially organized technical studies. Che Yaowu saw that the leaders and comrades were helping him so enthusiastically, and he couldn't help but think back to the difficulty of learning skills before liberation. At that time, he wanted to learn some skills from the master workers, but the master workers were afraid of losing their jobs and always kept something back. Now that the conditions are so good, how can he not study hard? He secretly criticized himself: "In the past, I scrapped the work because I didn't ask others, can I still do this now?" He made up his mind: "Study on, there is nothing that cannot be learned in the world, and there is nothing that can be done without learning. Don't do it until you have digested the blueprint thoroughly, and don't do it until you understand it. The smaller the tolerance, the more concentrated the mind must be. In any case, don't let rejected products escape."

    Sure enough, Che Yaowu intercepted a batch of rejected products that were almost ready to be shipped. He found that the dimensions on the sectional drawing of a set of templates did not match the dimensions on the overall drawing. If he made it according to that, it would definitely be a rejected product. He thought the original drawing couldn't be wrong, maybe the draftsman was careless. He took the blueprint to the technician. The technician looked at Che Yaowu with a suspicious look and said, "The blueprint can't be wrong, right?" But after looking carefully and comparing it with the original drawing, it turned out that a dimension was missing. In this way, persisting for ten days, twenty days, one month, two months, Che Yaowu no longer produced rejected products.

    His skills gradually improved, and the awkwardness gradually decreased, but new difficulties came again. The new jobs were all curved and curved, which were more difficult than the original straight-line jobs, and they all had deadlines, not allowing you to ponder slowly. Che Yaowu was not without hesitation in the face of difficulties. However, at this time, Che Yaowu had already joined the Communist Youth League. The sense of honor of the Youth League members supported him, and the encouragement of his comrades before and after joining the League and his own guarantees to the branch often appeared in his mind. These all helped Che Yaowu establish such a belief: "Without quality, there is no output. Today, we shouldn't let the national plan follow us, we should follow the plan, and we should try to run ahead of the plan." From then on, he treated his work more seriously than before. He took out all his strength to overcome difficulties and concentrated on studying the laws of production.

    He found that most of the rejected products produced by fitters were due to scribing and filing blanks. Some people, for fear of producing rejected products, deliberately left the scribing wider than the dimensions on the blueprint. In this way, it was easier to produce rejected products when filing blanks. Che Yaowu discovered this problem and paid special attention when scribing, making sure to scribe according to the specified dimensions, scribing one line, checking one line, and checking the whole thing again after scribing. After scribing, Che Yaowu filed the blanks very quickly. He said, "As long as the scribing is accurate, the next process can be done with confidence, and the work will naturally be faster."

    Carefulness can reduce rejected products, but it cannot guarantee that there will be no rejected products. To avoid rejected products, you must also have precise and skilled technology. First of all, you must be able to accurately design a counter-plate drawing yourself according to the blueprint of the template. This was also a difficult problem for Che Yaowu. He couldn't calculate angles and had difficulty reading drawings, let alone drawing drawings. In order to solve this problem, he often carefully asked his comrades for advice. Later, when he encountered similar work, he would design it himself first, and then take it to his comrades for modification. After many exercises, he finally learned to draw counter-plate drawings.

    A workpiece has main parts and secondary parts. The tolerance for the main parts is extremely small, and the tolerance for the secondary parts is relatively large. If you don't pay attention to this and use force evenly, the time will be slow and the quality will not be guaranteed. Che Yaowu summarized this experience, and as soon as he got a workpiece, he would analyze it clearly first. He paid attention to which parts needed high smoothness, which parts needed to leave a margin for grinding, and which parts could be worked on with less effort. Once he had a clear idea in his mind, he would boldly do it, which could both complete the task ahead of schedule and ensure quality.

    The quality of some products cannot be controlled by hand. Che Yaowu used his brain to operate the machine. In May last year, the labor competition was in full swing, but the tool workshop scrapped six of the seven key jobs, and the remaining one was also a substandard product. Che Yaowu thought that if the hand couldn't control it, maybe the machine could. So he suggested using a grinder to do it. Some people said, "Fitters can't do a good job by hand, it will be even worse on the machine." Some people joked with him, "If our workers could solve this key problem, they would have become technicians long ago." After being said by his comrades, Che Yaowu felt a little hesitant. Party group leader Zhao Yunxiang told him, "People say it can't be done, but they haven't tried it; you say it can be done, but you haven't tried it either, why don't you give it a try?" That's right! Isn't the universal tool tire also created by people? Didn't Wang Chonglun also succeed through experimentation? Thinking of this, courage came, and Che Yaowu prepared to give it a try. The Party group meeting studied how to help Che Yaowu, so the foreman helped find materials and tools, and the grinding worker Lu Xianjun (Party member) helped with the operation.

    On Saturday night, while the grinder was resting, Che Yaowu, with the help of Lu Xianjun and the Party group leader, experimented together. At three o'clock in the morning, the experiment was successful. If this method is followed in the future, there will be no more rejected products.

    Che Yaowu knew that he must do a good job in production, but for a long time he did not clearly understand the significance of individual good and collective good. Therefore, he did not help others enough in peacetime. Therefore, some workers in the workshop said that he "only cares about himself and is unwilling to help others." The Party and League organizations have also talked to him about these shortcomings more than once, but his understanding of these problems is not profound.

    One day, the workshop held a meeting, and the workshop director reported Che Yaowu's production experience, and many people said it was very good. However, some comrades in the fitter section did not like to listen and said, "Don't say three careful and two fast, even ten careful and ten fast, so what?" "You be careful with yours, we be careless with ours."

    Che Yaowu felt very uncomfortable when he heard these words. His comrades seized this opportunity to help him once again understand the relationship between the individual and the collective. Soon, Che Yaowu corrected this shortcoming with practical actions.

    The set of calipers made by the young worker Liang Peixian was ten millimeters wrong as soon as he started. This set of tools was needed urgently by another workshop and had to be delivered by the afternoon of the next day. He sadly took the rejected product to Che Yaowu. Che Yaowu only said one sentence, "Why don't you ask if you don't understand?" and told Liang Peixian to make another set. This time, from scribing to completion, Che Yaowu personally pointed out five or six times. By the time work was over the next morning, the workpiece was still more than an hour away from completion. If it was delayed until the afternoon, it would be postponed. At noon, everyone was resting, only Liang Peixian was buried in the workbench, and Che Yaowu stood attentively beside him, pointing. Before work, the calipers were made. At this time, a smile appeared on Che Yaowu's face. At the same time, he took out the rejected product to criticize Liang Peixian, pointing out all the shortcomings clearly from the first process.

    As soon as work was over that day, Liang Peixian went to find the League group leader, and before he could say three sentences, he burst into tears. The League group leader thought he couldn't stand the criticism, but Liang Peixian said, "Master Che has helped me so much, I will never forget it, and I will definitely work hard in the future." After that, Liang Peixian never produced a rejected product when making calipers.

    二十个月没有出过一次废品
    陈肯
    车耀武是南京市的一个优秀的青年钳工。他从一九五三年四月到一九五四年十二月（一九五四年底离职参加学习），二十个月没有出过一次废品和次品，完成和超额完成了任务。
    一九五三年，车耀武调到工具车间去工作了，以前他是在另一个工厂做修理工的。第一天进车间，他看到这个车间做的活都是新产品，他想这太好了，今后会学到很多技术。但是等到车间主任向他介绍生产情况，讲到质量要求很高，最精密的活不能有一根头发的七分之一的公差以后，他又有些害怕起来，心想：“过去别说没做过，就连看也没看过，这样高的要求，咱能行吗？”
    工长共产党员朱锦明，一眼就看出了车耀武的心事。他很温和地对车耀武说：“不要怕，今后我们互相研究，不懂就学吧。”这给车耀武增加了不少勇气，他想既然有同志们帮助，先细心干着再说。
    当车耀武开始干第一批活的时候，十分谨慎小心。虽然这批活比较简单，但是他还是把图纸看得仔仔细细，自己看了怕没把握，又向其他同志问清楚先加工哪一面，后加工哪一面，然后才一锉刀一锉刀地往下锉。果然第一批活合格了，接着第二批、第三批活都合格了。这些日子，车耀武太高兴了，一种不健康的想法在他的脑子里闪过了：“行啊，也不过如此，说得倒挺紧张。”于是当第四批活接到手的时候，他展开图纸，粗粗一看，就往抽屉里一搁，轻松地干了起来。
    产品成功了，车耀武把活儿量了一下，满有信心地拿给检验员。检验员拿图纸看了又看，把成品量了又量，然后慢慢地不愉快地说：
    “废啦！车耀武同志。”
    “什么？”车耀武有些着急，“按图纸规定的二·五，尺寸一丝也不差啊。”
    “可是图纸上的二·五是半径，你都把它做成直径了，这就小了一半。”
    车耀武的脸刷一下红到了耳根，心慌得直跳。这一夜回去，觉也睡不着，他想得很多，想起了几年前的事情：
    车耀武十二岁就进厂当学徒，那还是解放前的事。那时候，在工厂里干活，终天饿得他头昏眼花，两腿打晃。有一次，车耀武和工人们三天三夜没出厂门，实在饿得没法，拿了些黑豆去煮，恰巧又给工头碰上了，踢翻了锅不算，还撕去符号，要开除出厂。
    车耀武也想起了解放后第一天舅父对他说的话。舅父也是工人，解放前车耀武和他住在一起，大家经常挨饿。一解放，车耀武就得到了厂里发的二十斤粮食，拿回家去煮了一顿干饭吃。舅父边吃边说：“耀武啊，今后得好好干哪，人家共产党对咱一丈，咱可不能对人家八尺。”车耀武更想起了几年来党给他的教育，特别是进厂以来经常听到的质量教育。
    车耀武明白，现在已经不是什么“咱”和“人家”，“一丈”和“八尺”的问题了，而是“出了废品，就要推迟新产品的试制进度，就要影响国家计划的完成，这笔账可算不了啊！”他愈想愈难过。
    第二天，车耀武像做了亏心事一样，看见了人把脑袋一低，同别人一说话，自个就臊得脸红。一进车间，工长朱锦明就帮助车耀武寻找出废品的原因，最后亲切地说：“看错一个字，就要报废一批活，以后再不能粗心大意啊！”车耀武非常感动。病根子究竟在什么地方，工长没给他讲穿，自己也没有再往下讲，可是，他心里清楚：“论活自己还是干得了的，只是因为自满才出了错。”于是，暗自咬咬牙：“往后再也不这样了，怎样也不叫他报废。”
    从此，车耀武在干活之前，总是先把总图、分图、剖图看个清楚。可是，不仔细看倒罢，一仔细看，问题就多了，这也不懂，那也不懂，只好做一会活，看一会图；看一会图，问一下人。“多别扭啊！”车耀武想，“算了，马虎些吧，吃饭还掉饭粒呢。”但当他拿起锉刀的时候，面前马上又出现了一个问题：“这块料子从开矿到炼钢，从下料到加工，经过多少路，花费了多少人的劳动啊！再说我能用废品建设社会主义吗？”想到这里心里就砰砰跳，手也发软了。去问人吧，又怕人家厌烦。但是，从同志们对他热情诚恳的帮助中丝毫看不到厌烦情绪，特别是生产组长（也是党小组长）经常到他的工作台上去帮助工作，车间里又专门组织了技术学习。车耀武看到领导上和同志们这样热心地帮助自己，不能不使他回想到解放前学技术的困难。那时候，想跟老师傅学点技术，但老师傅怕丢了饭碗，总要留一手。现在这样好的条件，怎么能不好好学呢？他暗暗地批评自己：“过去就是因为没有问别人才报了废，现在还能这样吗？”他下定决心：“学下去，天下没有学不会的事情，也没有不学就会的事情，不消化透图纸不干，不弄懂不干。公差越小，思想越要集中，无论如何，不让废品逃过去。”
    果然，有一次车耀武截住了一批几乎要出手的废品。他发现一付样板的分图的尺寸和总图的尺寸对不起头来。如果照着做，肯定是废品。他想原图纸不会错，可能是绘图的人粗心。他拿了图纸去找技术员。技术员用怀疑的眼光望着车耀武说：“图纸，不会错吧？”可是仔细一看，再把原图拿出来一对照，原来漏掉了一个尺寸。就这样十天，二十天，一月，二月地坚持下去，车耀武不出废品了。
    他的技术逐渐提高了，别扭也逐渐减少了，但是新的困难又来了。新的活尽是一些带弧形的和曲线的活，这比原来做直线条的活要难，而且都是限期交货的，不容许你慢慢琢磨，在困难面前，车耀武不是没有犹豫过。但是，这时车耀武已经参加了青年团。青年团员的荣誉感在支持着他，入团前后同志们的鼓励以及自己向支部的保证都时常在他脑子里出现。这些都帮助车耀武树立了这样一个信念：“没有质量就没有产量，今天不应该叫国家计划跟着自己跑，应该自己跟着计划跑，而且应该想法跑到计划的前面去。”从这以后，他对待工作比过去更加认真了，他拿出全身的力量去克服困难，专心一意地研究生产的规律。
    他发现钳工出废品，大多数出在划线和锉毛坯上。有些人因为怕出废品，划线时故意比图纸的尺寸留宽些。这样，锉毛坯时反而容易出废品。车耀武发现了这个问题，划线时就特别留意，一定要按照规定的尺寸划，划一道，对一道，划完了再总的复对一遍。划完线后，锉毛坯时，车耀武就干得非常快，他说：“只要划线准确，下道工序就可以放手地做，工作自然就快了。”
    细心，可以减少废品，但还不能保证不出废品。不出废品，还必须有精确和熟练的技术。首先，要能够根据样板的图纸，自己再准确地设计一个对板图样。这对车耀武来说，也是一个难题。他不会计算角度，看图有困难，哪还谈得上画图。为了解决这个问题，他经常细心地向同志们请教，以后遇到类似的活，就自己先设计，然后再拿去请同志们修改，经过多次的练习，终于，他学会了画对板图样。
    一件工作物，有主要的地方，有次要的地方，主要的地方公差极小，次要的地方公差就比较大。如果不注意这一点，而平均使用力量，时间既慢，质量又没把握。车耀武总结了这条经验，工作物一上手，就先把它分析清楚。注意到哪些地方光洁度要高，哪些地方要留下研磨的余量，哪些地方可以少花点力气，心里有了数，就大胆地做下去，既能提前完成任务，又能保证质量。
    有些产品的质量，用手是掌握不了的，车耀武就动脑筋用机器去操作。去年五月里，劳动竞赛正热火，可是工具车间偏偏在七个关键活上就报废了六个，剩下的一个也是次品。车耀武想手不能掌握，也许机器能够掌握，于是建议用磨床来做。有人说：“钳工加工活，手工都做不好，到机床上更不行。”也有的跟他开玩笑说：“咱们工人要是能解决这个关键问题，早就当技术员了。”经同志们一说，车耀武心里倒有些踌躇起来。党小组长赵云祥告诉他：“人家说不行，没有试过；你说行，也没有试过，为什么不试试看呢？”对！万能工具胎，不也是人创造的吗？王崇伦不也是从试验到成功的吗？想到这，来了勇气，车耀武准备试试看。党小组会上研究了如何帮助车耀武的问题，于是工长帮助找材料和工具，磨工卢现俊（党员）帮助操作。
    星期六晚上，趁磨床休息的时候，车耀武在卢现俊和党小组长的帮助下，三个人动手试验，深夜三点钟，试验成功了，以后如果按照这种做法，就不再会有废品了。
    车耀武知道自己必须搞好生产，但在相当长的一段时期内他并不明确个人好还要集体好的意义。因而平时对别人的帮助不够，因此，车间里有些工人说他“只顾自己，不肯帮助别人”。这些缺点，党和团的组织也不止一次地同他谈过，但他对这些问题的认识并不深刻。
    一天，车间里举行会议，车间主任报告了车耀武的生产经验，很多人说很好。可是钳工工段的有些同志就不爱听，说：“别说三细二快，就是十细十快，又怎么样？”“你细你的，咱粗咱的。”
    车耀武听了这些话十分难受，同志们抓住这个机会帮助他再一次认识了个人同集体的关系问题。不久，车耀武用实际行动纠正了这个缺点。
    青工梁佩贤做的一付卡钳，刚上手就错了十个米厘。这付工具是别的车间急着用，限定第二天下午要交货的。他难过地把废品拿给车耀武去看。车耀武只说了一句：“不懂为什么不问？”就交代梁佩贤再做一付。这次从划线到完工，车耀武亲手去指点了五六次。到第二天上午下班时，工作物还差一个多小时才能完工。如果拖到下午，就要延期。中午，大家都休息了，只有梁佩贤在钳台上埋头操作，车耀武聚精会神地站在他的旁边指点着。上班以前，卡钳做成了。这下子车耀武的脸上露出了微笑，同时把废品拿出来批评梁佩贤，从第一道工序起，把缺点全指的清清楚楚。
    当天刚下班，梁佩贤去找团小组长，话没谈上三句，就哭了起来。团小组长还以为他挨不起批评，梁佩贤却说：“车师傅对我的帮助太大了，我永远也不会忘记，今后一定努力工作。”以后梁佩贤做卡钳，也没有出过废品。
