Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st: According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong, at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on August 29th, both sides reached an agreement to accept the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's recommendations regarding the temporary alteration of rear port inspection teams. These recommendations were proposed by the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and agreed upon by the four member representatives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. On the same day, the secretaries of both sides, acting on the instructions of the chief commissioners of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission, also reached an agreement on a joint reply to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission expressing consent to their recommendations.

As everyone knows, in a letter dated May 3, 1955, to the Military Armistice Commission, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission suggested temporarily withdrawing the inspection teams stationed at the ports of Gangneung and Gunsan in the South and the inspection teams stationed at the ports of Chongjin and Hungnam in the North. It also suggested that the remaining inspection teams be reduced from four members from each neutral nation to two members from each neutral nation.

The Korean-Chinese side had already notified the American side at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on July 14th that they agreed to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's above-mentioned recommendations and suggested that the secretaries of both sides submit a reply to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission expressing consent. However, the American side rejected the Korean-Chinese side's suggestion and evaded properly resolving the issues raised by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, delaying it until now.

Later, in a letter dated August 3rd to the Military Armistice Commission, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission further suggested replacing the ports of Gunsan with Daegu from the May 3rd letter.

As the Korean-Chinese side representatives clearly pointed out at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on July 14th, the Korean-Chinese side also believes that this temporary alteration does not violate the spirit of the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement. This measure will not weaken the role of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, nor will it hinder the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from performing the tasks entrusted to it by the Armistice Agreement.

The joint reply from the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, made on August 29th, is as follows:

To the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission,

1. The Military Armistice Commission hereby notifies that it will not oppose the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission immediately implementing the suggestions it made in its letter of May 3, 1955, which was later amended in its letter of August 3, 1955.

2. It is requested that the Military Armistice Commission be notified when the above-mentioned changes are completed.

Military Armistice Commission
Chief Commissioner of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers side
Major General Jeong Kuk-rok, Korean People's Army
Chief Commissioner of the United Nations Command side
Major General H.K. Parks, United States Air Force

    朝鲜停战双方同意中立国监察委员会建议
    暂时撤销派驻江陵和大邱、清津和兴南口岸的视察小组
    新华社平壤三十一日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在军事停战委员会八月二十九日的会议上，双方达成协议，同意由中立国监察委员会瑞士和瑞典委员提出、并经中立国监察委员会四国代表取得协议的中立国监察委员会关于暂时变更后方口岸视察小组的建议。同一天，双方秘书长会议，奉军事停战委员会双方首席委员之命，就双方对中立国监察委员会的建议联合提出表示同意的复信也达成了协议。
    大家知道，中立国监察委员会在一九五五年五月三日致军事停战委员会的信中，曾建议暂时撤销派驻南方的江陵、群山两个口岸的视察小组和派驻北方的清津、兴南两个口岸的视察小组；并且建议把其余的各视察小组从原来各由四个中立国成员组成改为各由两个中立国成员来组成。
    朝中方面已经在七月十四日军事停战委员会会议上通知美方：朝中方面同意中立国监察委员会的上述建议，并且建议由双方秘书长提出向中立国监察委员会表示同意的复信。但是，美方拒绝朝中方面的建议，并且回避正当地解决中立国监察委员会所提出的问题，一直拖延到现在。
    后来，中立国监察委员会在八月三日致军事停战委员会的信中又建议：把五月三日的信中所提出的南方的江陵、群山这两个口岸改为江陵、大邱。
    正如朝中方面代表七月十四日在军事停战委员会会议上所明确指出的一样，朝中方面还认为：这一暂时的变更并不违反停战协定有关条款的精神。这种措施不能减弱中立国监察委员会的作用，也不能妨碍中立国监察委员会执行停战协定所赋予它的任务。
    八月二十九日军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议联合作出的致中立国监察委员会的复信如下：
    致中立国监察委员会
    一、军事停战委员会兹通知：将不反对中立国监察委员会立即实施它在一九五五年五月三日的信中所提出，后来并在一九五五年八月三日的信中加以修正的建议。
    二、要求在上述变更完了时，通报军事停战委员会。
    军事停战委员会
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面首席委员
    朝鲜人民军少将郑国禄
    联合国军方面首席委员
    美国空军少将哈·克·帕克斯
