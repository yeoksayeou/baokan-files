    Standard Dormitory Design Drawings Suitable for North China Region
    Editor's Note: The Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has recently designed a batch of standard dormitory and office design drawings, totaling twenty-two schemes. These schemes powerfully demonstrate that all civil buildings, after reducing construction costs according to national standards, can still meet the living needs of residents and appropriately consider the aesthetics of the building on the basis of economy. We have selected a portion of the standard design perspective drawings and published them here for reference by construction units and design institutions in various regions. This part of the standard design is designed according to the characteristics of the North China region and may not be applicable to the whole country. Other regions should formulate different standard designs according to local characteristics. Two types of bungalow dormitory designs suitable for use in the North China region. [Right picture] Family dormitory, each household has a 16-square-meter bedroom, which can accommodate four people, and a 4-square-meter kitchen. If a nanny or older children need to live separately, the bedroom area can be reduced and the kitchen area increased, and a bed can be placed in the kitchen at night. [Left picture] Single dormitory, each unit has three bedrooms, a total of 56 square meters, which can accommodate 16 people. There is a 7-square-meter vestibule at the entrance, where a large stove can be installed for heating in winter. The toilets, water supply and drainage, and trash cans for these two types of dormitories are all centrally located outdoors. The cost per square meter is about 34 yuan to 35.6 yuan.

Each unit has eleven bedrooms, most of which are one bedroom per family, and a few are three bedrooms per family. There are four kitchens, some shared by two families and some shared by three families. One toilet is shared by every three families. Reinforced concrete floor. There are electric lights, water supply and drainage, and washbasins. Heating includes radiators and stoves. The cost per square meter with radiators is about 47 yuan; the cost per square meter with stoves is about 44 yuan. Suitable for ordinary employees to live in.

    华北地区适用的宿舍标准设计图
    编者按：建筑工程部设计总局最近设计出了一批宿舍和办公室的标准设计图，共计二十二种方案。这些方案有力地证明了一切民用建筑按照国家规定的标准降低造价以后，仍然可以满足居住者的生活需要和在节约的基础上适当照顾建筑的美观。我们选了一部分标准设计的透视图，刊登在这里，供各地建设单位和设计机关参考。这一部分标准设计，是根据华北地区的特点设计的，不一定适用于全国，其它各地应根据当地特点，制定不同的标准设计。适用于华北地区使用的两种平房宿舍设计。〔右图〕家属宿舍，每户有一间十六平方公尺的卧室，可供四人居住，有四平方公尺的厨房。如保姆或大小孩需要隔开住，可将卧室面积缩小，加大厨房面积，晚上在厨房内安床铺。〔左图〕单身宿舍，每单元有三间卧室，共五十六平方公尺，可住十六人，进门有七平方公尺的门斗，冬天可装大火炉一只取暖。这两种宿舍的厕所、给水排水、垃圾箱都在室外集中设立。每平方公尺造价约三十四元至三十五点六元。
    说明：〔右图〕①居室，②厨房；〔左图〕①居室，②门斗。适用于华北地区的三层家属宿舍楼房设计。每单元有十一间居室，多数是一家一居室，少数是一家三居室。厨房有四间，有两家合用的，有三家合用的。每三家合用一间厕所。钢筋混凝土地板。有电灯、上下水、洗涤盘，采暖有用暖气的，有用火炉的。用暖气的每平方公尺造价约四十七元；用火炉的每平方公尺造价约四十四元。适合一般职工居住。
    说明：①居室；②厨房；③厕所；④扶梯间；⑤走道；⑥阳台。适用于华北地区的三层楼房家属宿舍设计。每单元住两户，其中一户有三间卧室，一户有四间卧室；每户都有厨房、厕所、贮藏间（将来可改为淋浴室）。目前每户可供一家居住，也可以两家合住。有电灯、上下水、温水暖气，厨房有洗涤盘。每平方公尺的造价（概算）约六十元。供给收入较多，生活要求较高的干部居住。
