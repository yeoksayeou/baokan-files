    Chinese Art Troupe Gives Large-Scale Performance in Hanoi
    Vietnam-China Friendship Association Holds Tea Party to Welcome Chinese Art Troupe
    The Chinese Art Troupe gave a performance for more than 10,000 Vietnamese people on the evening of September 4th. This was the Chinese Art Troupe's first large-scale performance in Vietnam. Half an hour before the performance, the Hanoi People's Theatre was already packed with excited audience members. The aisles and the large trucks parked around the theatre were filled with people.
    Those who came to watch the performance included representatives attending the National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front, responsible cadres of the central organs of Vietnam, senior cadres of the Vietnam People's Army, personnel from various countries' embassies in Vietnam, as well as representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi and the broad masses of street residents.
    Every performance by the Chinese Art Troupe received a warm welcome from the audience. The "Tibetan Cavalry Dance," which expressed the cavalry's love for the motherland and heroic spirit, was especially loved by the soldiers of the People's Army. When the troupe sang "Victory Song of Dien Bien Phu," which is the most widely spread song among the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese folk song "Ten Loves," the audience couldn't help but sing along. The audience was very excited by the actors' clear and accurate pronunciation when singing Vietnamese songs, and the lifelike movements when dancing the Vietnamese dance "Bamboo Forest Carnival Dance." Many viewers said that this shows that the Chinese people are familiar with and love the Vietnamese people. On this evening, the Chinese Art Troupe also sang the Henan Opera "Hong Niang," a Chinese folk story familiar to the Vietnamese people, and played the flute, a musical instrument loved by the Vietnamese people. The audience also showed great interest in the "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance," which is full of Chinese national characteristics, and the soft and beautiful "Lotus Dance." These programs have already spread among the people of Hanoi. People were also very moved to watch the dance drama "The Flag," which expresses the high degree of internationalist feelings between the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Many people said that these programs break through the barriers of language, and the people of Vietnam and China are united heart to heart. Throughout the entire performance of the Chinese Art Troupe, the entire venue was immersed in a warm and joyous atmosphere inspired by the friendship between China and Vietnam.
    After the performance, one hundred and seventy-one representatives of people from all walks of life in Hanoi, including white-haired old men and six or seven-year-old children, rushed onto the stage with flowers and presented them to all members of the Chinese Art Troupe. At this time, thunderous applause and the song "Unity is Strength" resounded both on and off the stage. (Xinhua News Agency)
    On the morning of September 7th, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association held a tea party to welcome all members of the Chinese Art Troupe.
    Those present at the tea party included Shi Shan, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association; Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front and President of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association; Hoang Quoc Viet, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front and President of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor; Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace; and Le Thi Xuyen, President of the Vietnam Women's Union.
    Also present at the reception were Luo Guibo, Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, as well as representatives of overseas Chinese in Hanoi.
    Shi Shan, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, delivered a welcoming speech. He talked about the long-standing friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people and introduced the activities of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association. He said that the Vietnamese people deeply recognize the powerful force generated by the friendly cooperation between the Vietnamese and Chinese people, which helped the Vietnamese people's struggle against aggression in the past, and will certainly help Vietnam's current struggle to realize national unification and independence. Finally, Shi Shan shouted "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Vietnam and China!" "Long live President Ho!" "Long live Chairman Mao!", and the entire audience applauded enthusiastically and for a long time.
    Ding Xilin, head of the Chinese Art Troupe, said in his speech that the victory of the Vietnamese people is a great support for China's socialist construction. Now that the Vietnamese people are struggling to consolidate peace and build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous new Vietnam, the Chinese people will definitely give strong support. The unity and friendship between China and Vietnam and the unity and friendship of the world socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union are an indestructible and powerful force.
    After Ding Xilin's speech, the guests and hosts had pleasant and cordial conversations. Vietnamese and Chinese literary and art workers also sang songs at the meeting. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国艺术团在河内举行大规模演出
    越中友好协会举行茶会招待中国艺术团
    中国艺术团在九月四日晚间为一万多越南人民举行了演出。这是中国艺术团在越南的第一次大规模的演出。演出前半小时，河内人民剧场就挤满了兴奋的观众，剧场的走道上和停留在剧场周围的大卡车上都站满了人。
    来观看表演的有参加越南民族统一战线全国大会的代表，越南中央机关的负责干部，越南人民军高级干部，各国驻越南使馆的人员以及河内各界和广大街道居民的代表。
    中国艺术团演出的每一个节目都获得了观众的热烈欢迎。“藏民骑兵舞”表现出的骑兵的那种热爱祖国和英勇豪迈的气概，特别为人民军战士们所喜爱。当演唱在越南的人民中传布最广的歌曲“奠边府胜利歌”和越南民歌“十爱”时，台下的观众也情不自禁地跟着唱起来。观众对演员唱越南歌曲时咬字的清晰准确，跳越南舞蹈“竹丛联欢舞”时动作的维妙维肖，感到非常兴奋。许多观众说，这说明了中国人民熟悉和热爱越南人民。这一天晚上，中国艺术团还演唱了为越南人民熟悉的中国民间故事河南梆子“红娘”，吹奏了越南人民爱好的乐器——笛子。观众们对富于中国民族色彩的“采茶扑蝶舞”和柔美的“荷花舞”也感到极大的兴趣，这些节目早已在河内人民中流传开来。人们也非常感动地观看了表现朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军间的高度国际主义感情的舞剧“旗”。许多人说，这些节目冲破了语言的隔阂，我们越中人民是心心相印的。在中国艺术团的整个表演过程中，全场始终浸沉在被中越友谊所鼓舞的热烈欢乐空气中。
    表演结束后，一百七十一个河内各界市民的代表，其中有白发老翁，和六七岁的儿童，拿着鲜花涌上舞台，向中国艺术团全体人员献了花。这时，台上台下响起了欢腾的掌声和“团结就是力量”的歌声。（新华社）
    九月七日上午，越中友好协会举行茶会招待中国艺术团全体人员。
    出席茶会的有越中友好协会会长诗山，越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席和越苏友好协会会长孙德胜，越南国民联合战线全国委员会副主席和越南总工会主席黄国越，越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探，越南妇女联合会主席黎氏钏等。
    出席招待会的还有中国驻越南大使罗贵波，以及在河内的华侨代表等。
    越中友好协会会长诗山致欢迎词。他谈到了有悠久历史的越中人民的友谊，并且介绍了越中友好协会的活动。他说，越南人民深深地认识到和中国人民的友好合作所产生的强大力量，过去有助于越南人民反抗侵略的斗争，同样，它也一定将有助于目前越南为实现国家统一和独立的斗争。最后，诗山高呼“越中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”，全场热烈地久久不息地鼓掌。
    中国艺术团团长丁西林讲话说，越南人民的胜利，对中国社会主义建设事业是一个巨大的支持。现在越南人民为巩固和平，建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的新越南而斗争，中国人民必定给以大力的支持。中越两国之间的团结友谊和以苏联为首的世界社会主义和平民主阵营的团结友谊是不可摧毁的巨大力量。
    丁西林讲话后，宾主间进行了欢愉和亲切的交谈。越南和中国的文艺工作者还在会上演唱了歌曲。（新华社）
