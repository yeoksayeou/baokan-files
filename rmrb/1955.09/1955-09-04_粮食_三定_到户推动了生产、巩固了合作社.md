    Grain "Three Fixes" to Households Promoted Production and Consolidated Cooperatives
    Shi Zilu
    Before the work of fixing grain production, purchase, and sales ("three fixes") was thoroughly implemented to households in Huimin Township, Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, some people had ideological concerns. They were afraid of increased agricultural taxes and worried that the quotas would change after being set. Some members of agricultural cooperatives were also concerned that their income would decrease after the cooperative's distribution. Some middle peasants were even afraid to cook dry rice at home, even if they had it, and they were not enthusiastic about production.

    In response to these concerns, the township widely publicized policies. Through various meetings, they guided the masses to recall the pain of selling and buying grain in the past, enabling them to recognize the correctness, necessity, and benefits of the unified purchase and sale policy from their own experiences. Many people recalled the famine years before liberation, when grain merchants, landlords, and rich peasants hoarded goods for speculation, causing grain prices to rise wildly. In the autumn harvest of 1931, one hundred catties of grain were sold, but when it came time to eat in the summer of the following year, only two or three dou (twenty catties of grain yields one dou of rice) could be bought back. Many could not afford to buy rice and were forced to borrow at high interest rates or sell unripe crops; every village had twenty to thirty households in this situation. In the two years since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, grain prices have remained stable. In the past, famine years were characterized by many people fleeing famine, begging for food, many thieves, and many bandits. Last year, other provinces suffered severe floods, and some areas of this county also experienced severe famine. However, there were no people fleeing famine, begging for food, thieves, or bandits. The area was peaceful, and everyone felt at ease in production. These stark factual comparisons greatly enlightened the masses, enabling them to recognize the advantages and disadvantages and express their heartfelt support for the unified purchase and sale policy of grain. At the same time, it was pointed out that some middle peasants were afraid to eat dry rice even when they had it, and their production was not active, indicating that this phenomenon was not good, and explaining that having surplus grain was glorious and legal, eliminating misunderstandings among middle peasants. The middle peasants were very happy to hear this. For example, middle peasant Xue Mida said, "Surplus grain is the result of labor, and it is glorious and legal to have surplus grain. It is good to have enough to eat and work hard in production. I can listen to these words the most."

    After recognizing the benefits of the unified purchase and sale, most people still had doubts about the "three fixes," fearing that the quotas would change after being set. The township used the land reform policy, agricultural tax policy, and other policies promulgated by the Party and the People's Government since liberation for everyone to discuss, asking who these policies were made for, who benefited from them, and whether they had changed. Party member Lu Hairong and others said: Without these good policies, would we have the good life we have today? Many people recalled the announcement of the agricultural tax in 1952, saying that the fixed output would remain unchanged for three years. At that time, they were also half-believing and half-doubting, but it has not changed to this day. After discussing these situations, everyone criticized themselves for not trusting the policies of the Party and the government, saying that their fear of the "three fixes" policy changing was an unnecessary concern.

    After clearing up the ideological problems, the specific methods of fixing production, purchase, and sales were universally explained, so that the masses knew how much grain they produced, how much grain the state purchased, how much grain was retained for their own use, and how much grain was supplied to grain-deficient households. It was repeatedly publicized that fixed production and purchase would remain unchanged for three years, and the amount of grain sold would be fixed annually, encouraging everyone to run cooperatives well, actively engage in labor and production, and the more production increased, the more grain would be retained for their own use. Chen Erguan, a sixty-three-year-old member of Shenjia Village Cooperative, learned that the cooperative would complete the contracted production plan of 558 catties per mu, and the average person could retain 790 catties of grain, he said: "I will do my best to complete the contracted production plan." The members of the Sanxing Agricultural Cooperative understood that completing the increased production plan of 540 catties per mu would allow each person to retain an average of more than 700 catties of grain. All fifty-six male and female members of the cooperative actively accumulated fertilizer, and twenty-two elderly people and children also participated. Sheng Yuting, a middle peasant in Lujia Village, had planned to withdraw from the cooperative. After understanding the "three fixes" policy and seeing that the members were actively engaged in production and there was hope for increased production, not only did he firmly decide not to withdraw from the cooperative, but he also educated two other middle peasants who wanted to withdraw not to withdraw.

    At that time, the prominent problems in production were: widespread lack of fertilizer, uneven seedlings, and some fields were not weeded in time, resulting in serious weed infestation. After publicizing the "three fixes" to households, the masses were mobilized to conduct field inspections, so that they could see the quality of production and understand that only by working hard to increase production could they improve their lives, consolidate the cooperative, and support socialist construction. Then, field management work focusing on fertilizer accumulation and pest control was launched. All seventy boats in the township were successively put into fertilizer accumulation, and more than six hundred women went out to cut green grass every day. In the twelve days after the "three fixes" were implemented to households, the township accumulated enough water hyacinth, river mud, green grass, turf, and other fertilizers for 979 mu of land. Thirty-nine moth-luring gas lamps were lit, and 715 women and children participated in collecting eggs and catching moths.

### 粮食“三定”到户推动了生产、巩固了合作社

专栏：拥护农村粮食统购统销暂行办法

    粮食“三定”到户推动了生产、巩固了合作社
    史子禄
    浙江嘉善县惠民乡在粮食三定工作未深入到户以前，有些群众有思想顾虑，怕增加农业税，怕定后再变，有些农业合作社的社员，还怕合作社分配后，收入减少。有些中农家中有米也不敢煮干饭吃，生产也不积极。
    针对群众这些顾虑，这个乡广泛宣传了政策，通过各种会议引导群众回忆过去卖粮、买粮的痛苦，使群众从切身体验中认识统购统销政策的正确、必要和好处。不少群众都回忆了解放前的灾荒年成，粮商、地主、富农等囤积居奇，粮价疯狂上涨的情形。在一九三一年秋收时卖出一百斤谷，来年夏季要吃时只能买回二、三斗米（二十斤谷出米一斗），买不起米，被迫借高利贷、卖青苗的每村都有二三十户。实行粮食统购统销二年来，粮价始终平稳。过去灾荒年成是逃荒多、讨饭多、小偷多、土匪多，去年其他省有大水灾，本县有些地区灾荒也很严重，可是逃荒、讨饭、小偷、土匪都没有，地方安宁，大家放心生产。这些鲜明的事实对比，大大启发了群众的觉悟，使群众认清了利害，对粮食统购统销政策表示衷心拥护。同时也摆出有些中农家中有米不敢吃干饭，生产不积极的事实，指出这种现象是不好的，说明有余粮是光荣的合法的，消除中农的误解，中农听了顶高兴，如中农薛弥大说：“余粮是劳动所得，有余粮光荣合法，吃饱饭好着力生产，这些话我最听得进。”
    认识了统购统销的好处，但大部分人对三定还是抱怀疑态度，怕定了再变。这个乡就以解放以来党和人民政府颁布的土地改革政策、农业税政策等，让大家讨论，这些政策是为谁而订，是对谁有利，变没有变。党员陆海荣等说：没有这些好政策，还有今天的好日子？不少群众在回忆中想起一九五二年公布农业税，说定产三年不动，当时也是半信半疑的，到现在也没有变。谈出这些情况，大家都批评自己不相信党和政府的政策太不对，怕三定政策改变是多余的顾虑。
    思想疙瘩扫除了以后，普遍交代定产、定购、定销的具体办法，使群众知道自己生产多少粮食，国家收购多少粮食，留用多少粮食，缺粮户供应多少。反复宣传定产、定购三年不变，销粮数量一年一定，鼓励大家办好合作社，积极劳动生产，增产越多，留用粮就越多。沈家村社六十三岁的老社员陈二观，了解到社里完成每亩五百五十八斤的包产计划，平均每人就可留用粮七百九十斤时，他说：“要拚老命完成包产计划。”三星农业合作社社员明白了完成每亩五百四十斤的增产计划，每人平均可留用粮七百多斤，全社五十六个男女社员全部积极积肥，二十二个年老人和儿童也参加了。路家村中农盛玉庭曾打算要退社，了解了三定政策，看到社员在积极生产，增产有望，不但自己坚定不退社了，还教育另外两个想退社的中农也不退社。
    当时生产上存在的突出问题是：普遍缺肥，苗棵不匀，有些田未及时耘苗，草荒严重。宣传三定到户后，就发动群众进行田间检查，使群众看清生产的好坏，说明只有努力增产，才能改善生活，巩固合作社，支援社会主义建设。接着展开了以积肥、治虫为重点的田间管理工作。全乡七十只船先后投入积肥，每天出外割青草的妇女在六百人以上，在三定到户后的十二天中，全乡积的水草、河泥、青草、草皮等肥料够九百七十九亩田用。点诱螟蛾汽灯三十九盏，参加采卵捕蛾的妇女和儿童有七百十五人。
