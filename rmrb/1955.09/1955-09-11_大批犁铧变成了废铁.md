    A Large Number of Plowshares Have Become Scrap Iron
    Editor:
    In 1950, the Jiashan County Cooperative of Anhui Province purchased several thousand plowshares. Apart from those already sold, more than 1,200 have been piled up in the yard of the Hexia warehouse for a long time. Due to prolonged exposure to wind and sun, these plowshares can no longer be used and have become scrap iron. In the open space of this warehouse, there are also more than 20,000 jin of pig iron stored, some of which have been buried in the soil. When the passing masses saw this waste, they felt very distressed and suggested to the responsible comrades of this warehouse to find ways to improve the storage work. However, the person in charge of this warehouse replied, "This is a matter for the higher authorities, what can we do?" I think the Jiashan County Cooperative's attitude towards state property is extremely wrong, and I hope they will promptly and properly handle these materials.

### 大批犁铧变成了废铁

    大批犁铧变成了废铁编辑同志：
    安徽省嘉山县合作总社在一九五○年购进几千个犁铧，除了已经卖出了一部分以外，还有一千二百多个长期堆放在河下仓库的院子里。由于长期风吹日晒，现在这批犁铧已经不能使用，变成了废铁。这个仓库的露天地里，还存放着生铁二万多斤，有些已埋到土里去了。过往群众看见这种浪费现象，感到很痛心，曾向这个仓库的负责同志建议想办法改进保管工作。但是这个仓库的负责人竟回答说：“这是上级的事情，我们有什么办法呢？”我认为嘉山县合作总社对待国家财产的态度是极其错误的，希望他们迅速妥善处理这批物资。
