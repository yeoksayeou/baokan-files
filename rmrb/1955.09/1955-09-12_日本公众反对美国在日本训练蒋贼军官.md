Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Japanese public opinion's exposure of the United States' illegal activity of privately training Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops at US military bases in Japan has, according to the Associated Press, caused the US military authorities stationed in Japan to "feel surprised and flustered."

The US military authorities have issued various justifications for this, but the result has only exposed that the US is using Japan as a training ground for officers from its satellite states; and exposed that this activity of the US is with the consent and support of the Japanese government.

The US Far East Army Command issued a statement on the 9th saying that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers at US bases entered Japan with valid visas obtained from the Japanese government. The statement also said that the visa applications stated that the purpose of entry was to receive training at US military bases.

According to Kyodo News, US military authorities also revealed that records show that the US has been training foreign military officers at US military bases in Japan since the 1954 fiscal year, and even before that, including military personnel from Taiwan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Thailand, and South Korea. US Ninth Corps spokesman McCallaghan admitted that a group of Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers had received training from the US military in Japan in June this year. According to a re-exposure in the "Asahi Shimbun" evening edition on the 9th, another eight Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers received military training at the US military Yokohama Engineering Depot in Sagamihara City in July.

After various exposures, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry admitted on the evening of the 9th that the Japanese government had indeed agreed to the request of the US military stationed in Japan to allow some military personnel from "free Asian countries" to come to Japan to "inspect" US military facilities and receive "short-term" training. The Foreign Ministry spokesman also revealed that the Japanese government is considering another US request: that Japan formally agree to and cooperate with the following plan of the United States: to train their military personnel in Japan under the military assistance program between the United States and these Asian countries.

This admission by the US military authorities and the Japanese government has only aroused greater indignation from the Japanese public. Both the left and right wings of the Socialist Party believe that the Hatoyama government's endorsement of the US military stationed in Japan to train Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers is "rash" and "cannot be ignored" from the perspective of international practice. Both factions of the Socialist Party pointed out that the Japanese government should immediately protest to the United States. There are also reports that both factions of the Socialist Party will question the government on this issue at the Diet committee meeting in mid-September.

### 日本公众反对美国在日本训练蒋贼军官

    日本公众反对美国在日本训练蒋贼军官
    新华社十日讯　东京消息：日本舆论对美国私自在日本的美军基地训练蒋贼军的非法行为的揭露，据合众社说，已使驻日美军当局“感到惊讶和慌张”。
    美军当局为此发表了各式各样的辩解，然而结果反而暴露出美国正在利用日本作为训练它的仆从国家的军官的练兵场；并且暴露出，美国的这种活动是得到日本政府的同意和支持的。
    美国远东陆军司令部九日发表声明说，在美国基地的蒋贼军官是获得日本政府的有效的签证而进入日本的。声明又说，要求签证的申请书上说明了，入境的目的是要在美国军事基地接受训练。
    据共同社报道，美军当局还透露，根据记录证明，美国自一九五四财政年度以来，甚至在这以前，就已经在日本的美军基地训练外国军官，他们包括台湾、菲律宾、南越、泰国和南朝鲜的军事人员。美国第九兵团新闻官麦考尔甘承认，今年六月份已有一批蒋贼军官在日本受美军训练。据“朝日新闻”九日在晚刊中再次揭露，另外有八个蒋贼军官七月间曾在相模原市的美军横滨工兵仓库受军事训练。
    经过多方面的揭发，日本外务省发言人在九日晚承认，日本政府的确已经答应驻日美军的要求，同意让一些“自由亚洲国家”的军人到日本来“视察”美国的军事设施并且受“短期的”训练。外务省发言人还透露，日本政府正在考虑美国的另一项要求：日本正式同意美国的下列计划并且给予合作：根据美国和这些亚洲国家之间的军事援助计划来在日本训练它们的军人。
    美军当局和日本政府的这种承认只是引起了日本公众更大的愤慨。左、右两派社会党认为，鸠山政府赞同驻日美军训练蒋贼军官一举是“轻率”的，并且从国际惯例的观点来看也是“不能忽略的”。两派社会党指出，日本政府应该立即向美国提出抗议。还有消息说，两派社会党将在九月中旬的国会委员会会议上就这个问题向政府提出质询。
