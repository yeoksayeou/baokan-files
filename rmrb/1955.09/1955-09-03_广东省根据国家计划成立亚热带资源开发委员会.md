Guangdong Province Establishes Subtropical Resource Development Committee According to National Plan

    According to the provisions of the national plan, Guangdong Province has established the Subtropical Resource Development Committee.
    This committee is composed of agriculture, reclamation, water conservancy, wasteland survey and design, planning departments, and agricultural scientific research institutions, and is now carrying out various preparations for development. The committee's preliminary work plan requires: within 1957, to fully complete the survey and planning work for development, propose a comprehensive and overall preliminary plan, and at the same time establish various experimental sites and train a group of technical cadres. During the second and third five-year plans, based on mutual aid and cooperation organizations and taking state-owned farms and tractor stations as bases, immigrants will be organized to reclaim more than 10 million mu of wasteland, planting important industrial raw material crops such as subtropical hemp, oil crops, Sea Island cotton, coffee, and sugar cane, as well as tropical specialties with high economic value. At the same time, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery will be combined for multi-faceted development and management.
    The Guangdong subtropical resource development area includes Hainan Island, Leizhou Peninsula, and Qinzhou Special Zone. These places have a hot climate, abundant rainfall, and a lot of wasteland, with superior production conditions. They also face the South China Sea and the Beibu Gulf fishing grounds, with great development prospects. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东省根据国家计划成立亚热带资源开发委员会
    根据国家计划的规定，广东省已成立了亚热带资源开发委员会。
    这个委员会由农业、垦殖、水利、荒地勘测设计、计划部门和农业科学研究机关等组成，现在正在进行开发的各种准备工作。委员会的初步工作计划要求：在一九五七年内充分做好开发的勘测规划工作，提出综合性的全面的初步规划方案，并同时建立各种试验场所和训练一批技术干部。到第二个和第三个五年计划期间，便以互助合作组织为基础，以国营农场和拖拉机站为基地，组织移民，开荒一千多万亩，种植亚热带麻类、油料作物、海岛棉、咖啡和甘蔗等重要工业原料作物和经济价值很高的热带特产，同时结合林、牧、渔业多方面开发经营。
    广东亚热带资源开发地区包括海南岛、雷州半岛和钦州专区，这些地方气候炎热，雨量充足，荒地又很多，生产条件优越，又面临南海和东京湾渔场，有很大发展前途。（新华社）
