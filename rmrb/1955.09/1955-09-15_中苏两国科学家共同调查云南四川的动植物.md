    Chinese and Soviet scientists jointly organized a comprehensive expedition that conducted flora and fauna surveys in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces of China for more than five months. This work has now come to an end. The six Soviet scientists, led by Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Popov, left China in late August to return to the Soviet Union.

    This expedition studied the faunal and floral history of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. Their research is very helpful for the study of China's natural zoning.

    During their stay in China, the Soviet scientists participating in the expedition visited relevant scientific research institutions in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other cities; studied a wealth of valuable scientific data; and gave many reports on Soviet scientific achievements and academic topics to Chinese experts. They also collected more than 60,000 insect specimens and approximately 10,000 plant specimens, many of which were not available at the Zoological Institute and Botanical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The results of the study of these materials will be published in the journals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

    This is the first time that scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Sciences have cooperated in conducting field surveys. Scientists from both countries believe that this cooperative expedition has made a good start for future creative cooperation in animal and plant research between the two countries.

    中苏两国科学家共同调查云南四川的动植物
    中国科学院和苏联科学院共同组织的综合考察队在中国云南省和四川省进行了五个多月的动植物考察工作，现在已告一段落。考察队中以苏联科学院通讯院士波波夫为首的六位苏联科学家已在八月下旬离开中国回苏联去。
    这个考察队研究了云南、四川两省的动物区系和植物区系的历史。他们的研究工作对中国自然区划的研究很有帮助。
    参加考察队的苏联科学家在中国期间曾访问过北京、广州、上海、重庆以及其他一些城市的有关科学研究机构；研究了许多有价值的科学资料；对中国专家们作了许多有关苏联科学成就和学术报告。他们还收集了六万多个昆虫标本和约一万件植物标本，其中许多是苏联科学院动物学研究所和植物学研究所没有过的。这些材料的研究结果将在中国科学院和苏联科学院的刊物上发表。
    中苏两国科学院的科学家合作进行野外调查工作还是第一次。两国科学家都认为这次的合作考察工作为今后两国动植物研究方面的创造性合作作了良好的开端。           （新华社）
