The Second Representative Conference of the Chinese Communist Party Jiangsu Province Committee was held from August 20th to September 8th. A total of 342 representatives and observers attended the conference.

    The conference, after conscientiously studying the documents of the Party's National Congress, listened to and discussed the report of the responsible comrade of the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee. One hundred and thirty representatives spoke during the general discussion.

    The conference believes that in order to fulfill and over fulfill the glorious tasks assigned to Jiangsu Province by the First Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to further carry out the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas, strengthen leadership, make comprehensive plans, criticize right-leaning conservative ideas, implement the Party's class line in rural areas, and develop agricultural production cooperatives in a planned and active manner. In the coming winter and spring, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province will be developed from more than 35,700 before June of this year to 100,000, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 30% of the total number of households; in 1957, it will be developed to 200,000 cooperatives, including the expansion of old cooperatives, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 60%, and do a good job in rectification and consolidation. At the same time, measures suitable for increasing agricultural production in the area should be taken to develop agricultural production and increase cotton production to 84% over the highest pre-war level; grain production should be increased to 37.15% over the highest pre-war annual output. This will guarantee the completion of the task of increasing the total agricultural output value of the province by 23.23% as stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan.

    The conference pointed out that it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Central Committee's decision throughout the province and carry out a comprehensive conservation campaign. In industrial production, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership and supervision of factories and mines, strengthen technical leadership, increase production, improve quality, reduce costs, and ensure the completion and over fulfillment of state plans. Improve grain supply in urban and rural residents, conserve grain, and repeatedly educate all cadres and the broad masses of people to cultivate a new atmosphere of practicing thrift and opposing waste.

    The conference demanded that the entire Party must strengthen the Party's ideological and organizational construction. Educate all cadres and the people with the Gao Gang, Rao Shushi incident, the Pan Hannian incident, and the Hu Feng incident, raise revolutionary vigilance, overcome complacency and paralysis, purify the revolutionary ranks, severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements.

    The representatives learned lessons from the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance incident and deeply examined and criticized bourgeois individualism and arrogance and complacency. The conference requested all Party members to enhance revolutionary enthusiasm and class vigilance, maintain the optimism and humble and prudent attitude of Communists, fully promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, overcome bourgeois individualism, arrogance and complacency, and right-leaning paralysis, strictly abide by the Party's system of collective leadership, implement strict top-down and bottom-up supervision, enforce Party discipline, ensure the purity and unity of the Party, and give full play to the Party's leading role in all work, so as to unite the people of the province to work diligently, overcome difficulties, strive to increase production, practice thrift, and ensure the completion and over fulfillment of the glorious tasks assigned to Jiangsu Province by the First Five-Year Plan.

    The conference finally elected the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Committee with Qiu Yihan as secretary. It also unanimously adopted the "Resolution of the Second Representative Conference of the Chinese Communist Party Jiangsu Provincial Committee." (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

    The First Representative Conference of the Chinese Communist Party Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was held in Hohhot City from September 2nd to 14th.

    The representatives studied and discussed the various documents of the Party's National Congress and the issue of agricultural cooperation. They listened to and discussed the report of the CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee: "Strengthen the Party's leadership over economic construction and strive to successfully complete and over fulfill the national and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's First Five-Year Plan" "Learn from the lessons of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance incident, oppose the erosion of the Party by bourgeois ideology, and strive to further enhance the Party's unity and improve the Party's combat effectiveness." The representatives unanimously supported the various resolutions of the Party's National Congress, agreed with the two reports of the Party committee, and were willing to strive for their complete realization.

    The conference announced the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's First Five-Year National Economic Plan (draft) that had been approved by the state. The conference believes that, according to the specific circumstances of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the focus of the Five-Year Plan is to develop agricultural and pastoral production centered on mutual aid and cooperation. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership over key projects and industrial production, and resolutely and comprehensively complete the national plan. The conference reviewed the implementation of the plan in the past two and a half years and pointed out that the various plans were not well completed in the first half of this year. The conference called on Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, improve leadership, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and strengthen national unity, launch a comprehensive production increase and conservation campaign, eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, work diligently, study hard, overcome difficulties, and strive for the completion and over fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan.

    Seventy-three representatives spoke at the plenary meeting. They strictly criticized and self-criticized the leadership and work of Party organizations at all levels in the region, as well as the shortcomings and errors within their responsible areas, especially bourgeois individualism, great-Han chauvinism, and right-leaning conservative ideas in the agricultural and pastoral mutual aid and cooperation movement, and right-leaning paralysis in the class struggle.

    The conference finally passed a resolution and elected the CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Supervisory Committee. (Our correspondent in Hohhot)
