Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd: A grand military parade and procession were held in Hanoi on September 2nd, the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

On this day, Hanoi residents were already buzzing with excitement before dawn. People joyfully streamed towards Ba Dinh Square, illuminated by colorful electric lights along the streets. As the light of dawn pierced through the trees and shone on the square, it had already transformed into a sea of red flags, flowers, and smiling faces. The rostrum in the square was a palace-like structure. On either side were written "Long Live Vietnam Peaceful, Unified, Independent, and Democratic" and "Long Live the World's Forces for Peace and Democracy." Today, it appeared especially beautiful against the backdrop of red flags.

On the viewing stands on both sides of the rostrum were filled with foreign envoys and diplomatic officials, members of the International Commission, representatives from all walks of life in Vietnam, combat heroes of the People's Army, and model workers from industry and agriculture. Messengers of friendship from the Chinese and Korean people—members of the Chinese Art Troupe and the Korean People's Delegation and Korean Art Troupe—also attended the ceremony.

At 6:30 AM, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and leaders of the Vietnamese government and the Vietnam Workers' Party, including Truong Chinh, Ton Duc Thang, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Hoang Quoc Viet, stepped onto the rostrum. At this moment, thunderous applause erupted from the square and the viewing stands.

Thirty-round salute was fired, and the grand National Day ceremony officially began.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh delivered a call to the entire Vietnamese people. In his address, Chairman Ho Chi Minh reviewed the many significant changes that had taken place internationally and within Vietnam over the past ten years. He pointed out that the current tasks of the Vietnamese people and government are to continue fighting for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, that is, to fight for the consolidation of peace and the realization of unification. Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the entire nation to unite as one, to strive to expand and consolidate the national united front, to work hard to consolidate North Vietnam, and to effectively assist the struggle of the South Vietnamese people for peace and unification.

After Chairman Ho Chi Minh finished speaking, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, inspected the troops participating in the parade by car. General Vo Nguyen Giap then read the order to all commanders and fighters of the Vietnamese People's Army. In his order, Vo Nguyen Giap warmly praised all commanders and fighters of the Vietnamese People's Army who had bravely completed their tasks during the war of resistance and actively struggled to implement the ceasefire agreement after the restoration of peace. Vo Nguyen Giap ordered all commanders and fighters to unite closely with the people of the whole country and continue to fight for the consolidation of peace and the realization of unification.

At 7:10 AM, the march-past began. Marching past the rostrum for inspection were troops from various branches of the Vietnamese People's Army, local forces, and guerrillas.

Following the military parade, a grand procession of 170,000 working people from Hanoi began. A guard of honor of one thousand workers, carrying red flags and portraits of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and portraits of the leaders of fraternal countries, led the way. Behind them was a jubilant contingent of children.

More than 20,000 workers from Hanoi, Hai Phong, and Hong Gai marched past the rostrum with excitement and pride. Charts held high by Hanoi workers showed that Hanoi workers had produced 149 outstanding workers in the labor emulation movement, put forward more than 1,100 rationalization proposals, and saved more than 440 million Vietnamese dong.

More than 20,000 farmers from the suburbs of Hanoi participated in the parade, carrying models of rice, corn, pineapples, and bananas.

As representatives of the people from South Vietnam passed by, the crowd in the procession and the people on both sides shouted in unison, "Vietnam is a unified whole," "Resolutely oppose the conspiracy of US imperialism and its puppet cliques to sabotage the peaceful unification of Vietnam," and other slogans.

Following them was a procession of more than 30 ethnic minorities in Vietnam wearing festive costumes, along with contingents of students and youth, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, religious circles, government staff, and women.

Finally, came the vast army of athletes and artists. Vietnamese artists performed beautiful Vietnamese folk dances in front of the rostrum. Members of the Chinese Art Troupe, who had just arrived in Vietnam for a visit, performed "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance," "Lion Dance," and "Red Ribbon Dance" in front of the rostrum in colorful costumes. The Korean Art Troupe, also visiting Vietnam, performed dances in front of the rostrum.

The procession ended at 10:00 AM.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd: Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a grand reception on the 2nd to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    河内、海防、鸿基的两万多个工人以兴奋和骄傲的心情走过主席台。河内工人高举的图表表明：河内工人在劳动竞赛运动中涌现了一百四十九个优秀劳动者，提出了一千一百多件合理化建议，节约越币四亿四千多万元。
    来自河内郊区的两万多农民拿着稻米、玉米和菠萝、香蕉的模型参加了游行。
    当来自南越的人民代表走过时，游行队列里的人群和两旁的人们同声高呼“越南是一个统一的整体”、“坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗集团破坏越南的和平统一的阴谋”等口号。
    接着走过主席台前的是穿着节日盛装的越南三十多个少数民族的队伍、学生和青年的队伍和工商界、宗教界、机关工作人员和妇女的队伍。
