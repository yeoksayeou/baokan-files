The Xinbaidong vertical shaft project of the Datong Coal Mine, the first pair of modern vertical shafts planned to be newly built in North China this year, officially commenced on August 21. This pair of large-scale new-type vertical shafts was designed by the Beijing Design Institute of the former Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. The entire production process will be mechanized, and belt conveyors will be used to transport coal. Each hoist can transport more than three tons of coal from the bottom of the well to the surface. The pair of vertical shafts is planned to be completed and put into production in 1957, and its annual output is equivalent to one-fifth of the Datong Mining Bureau's planned coal output this year.

    大同新白洞竖井工程开工
    大同煤矿今年计划新建的华北地区第一对现代化竖井——新白洞竖井工程，已经在八月二十一日正式开工。这对规模巨大的新型竖井，是由前燃料工业部煤矿管理总局北京设计院设计的。它的全部生产过程都将是机械化的，并将使用皮带运输机运输煤炭，井筒提升每次可从井底把三吨多的煤炭运到地面上来。这对竖井计划在一九五七年内建成并投入生产，它的年产量相当于大同矿务局今年计划产煤量的五分之一。　（张国权）
