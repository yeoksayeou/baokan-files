    On Dulles' Speech at the United Nations General Assembly

    What exactly is the United States prepared to do to further ease international tensions and implement the "Geneva Spirit"? This is a question people cannot help but ask after reading U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' speech to the Tenth United Nations General Assembly on September 22nd.

    Dulles said some fine-sounding words in his speech. He spoke of a "new spirit" that is now "prevailing," and he talked about making the "Geneva Spirit permanent." However, when it came to concrete issues, his "Geneva Spirit" disappeared, particularly his slander and defamation of China, which profoundly demonstrated his efforts to maintain an atmosphere of international tension in order to strengthen the "Cold War."

    Dulles spoke of several pressing international issues awaiting resolution after the Geneva Four-Power Conference: European security and the German question, the disarmament issue, and the Far East situation. Everyone knows that, after the Geneva Four-Power Conference, thanks to the initiatives taken by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, new developments have taken place in all of these issues. These new developments are having a significant impact on promoting the resolution of these major international problems and easing international tensions.

    However, on the U.S. side, until now, people have not seen corresponding efforts. From Dulles' speech, one cannot see what efforts the United States is prepared to make on these two issues.

    On the German question, Dulles still adopts an unrealistic attitude, attempting to continue to ignore the existence of the German Democratic Republic. But everyone knows that if one does not recognize the fact that there are two Germanys and insists on unifying one Germany with another, it is actually obstructing German unification. This makes the sincerity of Dulles' claim of hoping to "achieve German reunification within the framework of European security" lose its value. Moreover, Dulles also stated that West Germany should remain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Dulles also threatened that "it cannot be imagined that Western countries—including the United States—will always be prepared to expand their existing obligations to accommodate Soviet concerns about European security." Here, Dulles has long departed from the "Geneva Spirit" and fallen into the quagmire of "power politics."

    On the issue of disarmament, Dulles also adopted a passive attitude. He did not put forward any positive suggestions or plans, but only insisted on so-called "aerial inspection" and believed that only after this is done would it be possible to reduce armaments. This is actually trying to set aside the disarmament issue, which should take precedence, and only focus on so-called investigation and inspection. Max Lerner, a commentator for the U.S. New York Post, said, "Conducting investigations and inspections without reducing armaments is worse than reducing armaments without conducting investigations and inspections. If you know that your opponent has surpassed you, this can only lead to a sharp arms race." This is an apt comment. Although Dulles talked about the peaceful use of atomic energy, he completely avoided mentioning the issue of banning the use of atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Dulles' attitude is completely consistent with the views of U.S. representative Stassen on the United Nations Disarmament Commission's Sub-Committee. Stassen said, "The United States does not intend to discuss the reduction of nuclear weapons or conventional armaments, but only intends to implement a system of investigation, inspection, and warning." Obviously, Dulles' attitude cannot promote but only hinder the resolution of the disarmament issue.

    Dulles showed no positive interest in the peaceful resolution of the German issue and the disarmament issue, but he re-raised the so-called "problem of certain Eastern European countries" and the "problem of international communism," and wanted to use these two issues, which were proven to be absurd at the Four-Power Conference, as a "barometer of the Soviet Union's true intentions." However, people have every reason to regard these two issues as a barometer of Dulles' true intentions. Because these two issues precisely show that Dulles has an indescribably strong interest in continuing the "Cold War."

    Dulles' "Cold War" interest is also fully manifested in his speech on the Far East issue. He boasted about the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" and declared that this treaty "still applies to" Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam. He took out all the clichés from the "Cold War" arsenal to wantonly slander China, and attributed the Chinese government's efforts to ease the situation in the Far East to the victory of the American "policy of strength." Dulles still insists on interfering in China's internal affairs, demanding that the Chinese people abandon their sovereignty over Taiwan. At the same time, he blatantly flaunted the U.S.-Chiang treaty and the power granted by the U.S. Congress to Eisenhower to use armed forces to "defend" Taiwan, Penghu, and so-called "related areas," attempting to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their territory of Taiwan by threatening with so-called "another war, the scope of which certainly cannot be limited."

    In order to defend his arrogant position, Dulles openly declared that China's actions to liberate its territory of Taiwan constituted a so-called "huge challenge" to American "principles" and were a "direct and special challenge to the United States itself." He openly announced that the United States has a "unique relationship with these islands."

    People want to ask: What exactly are the so-called "principles" of the United States? Taiwan is Chinese territory, and it is separated from the United States by the Pacific Ocean. How can the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan become a "direct special challenge” to the United States across the Pacific? The problem obviously lies in the fact that the United States has a "unique relationship" with these Chinese islands. This "unique relationship," which Dulles dared not further clarify, is that the United States has occupied Taiwan with its armed forces and turned it into an American colony and military base. This is indeed a "relationship" that is very different from normal international relations. In order to maintain and strengthen this "relationship," the United States wants to use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. It is clear that the American "principle" is the principle of aggression, the "principle" of disregarding all international laws and the United Nations Charter. No matter how Dulles clamors, this kind of "principle" has no room for existence today. Dulles' emphasis on these aggressive "principles" at the United Nations General Assembly is a challenge to all people who demand an end to the "Cold War" and a relaxation of international tensions.

    When Dulles talked about the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, he deliberately linked the early release of eleven American spies by the Chinese people in accordance with their own legal procedures and in order to ease the situation with the so-called United Nations resolution, attempting to distort the significance of this action by China. Moreover, he completely avoided talking about what efforts the United States is prepared to make in implementing the agreement on the first item on the agenda. At the same time, although the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks have reached an agreement on the first item on the agenda, and the Chinese side has already proposed two topics under the second item on the agenda: the issue of embargo and preparations for higher-level Sino-U.S. negotiations, the U.S. side still refuses to enter into discussions on the second item on the agenda. Comparing Dulles' attitude with the attitude adopted by the Chinese government in the Sino-U.S. talks, it is clear who has the sincerity to resolve the problem.

    From Dulles' speeches on various major international issues, one cannot see the spirit of reconciliation and sincere consultation that is the hallmark of the "Geneva Spirit," and one cannot see anything that can promote mutual trust. On the contrary, one smells a stale whiff of the "Cold War." Especially on the issue of the Far East situation, Dulles does not seem to have received any inspiration from the "Geneva Spirit," but still clings to the bankrupt "policy of strength."

    After the Geneva Four-Power Conference, the people of all countries have become increasingly determined to demand that the major powers, which have special responsibility for maintaining world peace, prove their sincerity in easing international tensions with actions. It is not enough to merely express a desire for peace verbally; action must be taken now. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have already proven their sincerity with actions. People have the right to demand that the United States also show its sincerity.

### 评杜勒斯在联合国大会上的发言

    评杜勒斯在联合国大会上的发言
    美国究竟准备为贯彻“日内瓦精神”，进一步缓和国际紧张局势做些什么？这是人们在读了美国国务卿杜勒斯九月二十二日在第十届联合国大会上的发言以后不能不提出的问题。
    杜勒斯在他的发言中说了一些漂亮话。他说什么现在“盛行了一种新的精神”，他还谈到什么要使“日内瓦精神成为永久的”。可是，到了谈到具体问题时，他的“日内瓦精神”就不见了，特别是他对中国的诽谤和诬蔑，深刻地表现他力图保持国际紧张气氛，以便加强“冷战”。
    杜勒斯谈到了日内瓦四大国会议以后有待解决的几个迫切的国际问题：欧洲安全和德国问题，裁军问题和远东局势问题。人人知道，在日内瓦四大国会议以后，由于苏联和中华人民共和国方面所采取的主动，在所有这几个问题上都已经有了新的发展。这些新的发展在促进这些重大国际问题的解决和国际局势的缓和上，正在产生巨大的影响。
    可是，在美国方面，一直到现在为止，人们还没有看见与此相应的努力。从杜勒斯的发言中人们更看不到美国在这两个问题上准备作什么努力。
    在德国问题上，杜勒斯仍然采取不现实的态度，企图继续无视德意志民主共和国的存在。而任何人都知道，如果不承认存在两个德国这个事实，硬想由一个德国来统一另一个德国，那实际上就是要阻挠德国的统一。这也就使杜勒斯所声称的希望“在欧洲安全的范围内实现德国重新统一”的话的真诚性失去价值。何况杜勒斯还表示西德应该仍然留在北大西洋公约集团之内。杜勒斯还威胁说，“不能设想，西方国家——包括美国在内——将会始终准备扩大它们现有的义务来适应苏联对欧洲安全的关切。”杜勒斯在这里早已远离了“日内瓦精神”，陷入“实力政策”这个臭泥坑里面去了。
    在裁军问题上，杜勒斯也采取了消极的态度。他没有提出任何积极的建议或计划，只是坚持实行所谓“空中视察”，并且认为只有这样以后才有可能裁减军备。这实际上就是想把占首要地位的裁军问题撇开不谈，而只想实行所谓调查和视察。美国纽约邮报评论员马克斯·勒纳说：“在不裁减军备的情况下，进行调查和视察，比裁减军备而不进行调查和视察更坏。如果你知道你的对手超过了你，这只能导致急剧的军备竞赛。”这是恰当的评论。杜勒斯虽然谈到了和平利用原子能的问题，但是对于禁止使用原子武器和大规模毁灭性的武器问题，却完全一字不提。杜勒斯的态度和美国在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的代表史塔生的观点是完全一致的。史塔生说，“美国不打算讨论关于裁减核子武器或常规军备的问题，而只想实行调查、视察和警告制度。”很明显，杜勒斯的这种态度绝不能促进而只能阻挠裁军问题的解决。
    杜勒斯对于和平解决德国问题和裁军问题毫不表示积极兴趣，但是他却重新提出了所谓“某些东欧国家”的问题和“国际共产主义问题”，并且要把这两个早在四大国会议上就被证明了是荒唐的问题作为“表明苏联的真正意图的晴雨计”。但是，人们完全有理由把这两个问题作为表明杜勒斯的真正意图的晴雨计。因为这两个问题恰恰表明：杜勒斯对于继续进行“冷战”有着难以形容的浓厚的兴趣。
    杜勒斯的这种“冷战”兴趣也充分表现在他的关于远东问题的发言中。他吹嘘所谓“东南亚集体防御条约”，宣布这个条约“还适用于”柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部。他从“冷战”武器库中搬出所有的陈腔滥调来对中国肆行诬蔑，把中国政府为了缓和远东局势而作的努力都说成是美国“实力政策”的胜利。杜勒斯仍然坚持干涉中国的内政，要求中国人民放弃对台湾行使自己的主权。同时，他又露骨地炫耀美蒋条约和美国国会授予艾森豪威尔的用武装力量“保卫”台湾、澎湖和所谓“有关地区”的权力，企图用所谓“其范围肯定不可能有限的另一次战争”的威胁来阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。
    为了给自己这种横蛮的立场辩护，杜勒斯公然宣称，中国解放自己的领土台湾的行动，构成了对美国的所谓“原则”的“一个巨大的挑战”，是“对美国本身的一个直接的特别的挑战”。他公然宣布说，美国“同这些岛屿有与众不同的关系”。
    人们要问：美国的所谓“原则”究竟是什么？台湾是中国的领土，它和美国隔着一个太平洋。中国人民解放台湾，怎么会成为对太平洋彼岸的美国的一个“直接的特别的挑战”？问题显然就在于美国和这些中国的岛屿有了“与众不同的关系”。这种杜勒斯不敢加以进一步阐明的“与众不同的关系”，就是美国用它的武装力量占据了台湾，把它变成了美国的殖民地和军事基地。这倒的确是和正常的国际关系大不相同的“关系”。为了保持和加强这种“关系”，美国就要用武力来阻止中国人民解放台湾。很明显，美国的“原则”是侵略的原则，是蔑视一切国际法规和联合国宪章的“原则”。无论杜勒斯怎样叫嚣，这种“原则”在今天没有丝毫存在的余地。杜勒斯在联合国大会上强调这些侵略“原则”，就是向要求结束“冷战”、和缓国际局势的一切人们挑战。
    杜勒斯谈到中美大使级会谈的时候，有意把中国人民按照自己的法律程序并为了和缓局势而提前释放十一名美国间谍，同所谓联合国决议扣在一起，企图歪曲中国这一行动的意义。他而且完全不谈美国在实施第一项议程的协议上准备作些什么努力。同时，尽管中美大使级会谈已经对第一项议程达成协议，中国方面已经在第二项议程下提出禁运问题和准备高一级中美谈判的两项议题，美国方面仍然拒绝进入第二项议程的讨论。拿杜勒斯的这种态度和中国政府在中美会谈中所采取的态度两相比较，就可以清楚地看出，具有解决问题的诚意的究竟是谁。
    人们从杜勒斯关于各项重大国际问题的发言中，看不到作为“日内瓦精神”的标志的那种和解的和诚意协商的精神，看不到可以促进相互信任的东西。相反，人们却闻到了一股陈腐的“冷战”的气息。特别在远东局势的问题上，杜勒斯似乎并没有从“日内瓦精神”中得到什么感召，而仍然抱住那个早已破产了的“实力政策”不放。
    在日内瓦四大国会议以后，各国人民已经越来越坚决地要求对维护世界和平负有特殊责任的各个大国用行动来证明它们对于缓和国际局势的诚意。仅仅在口头上表示和平的意愿是不行的了，现在必须拿出行动来。苏联和中华人民共和国已经用行动证明了自己的诚意。人们有权利要美国也拿出它的诚意来。
