Xinhua News Agency, Correspondent in Bonn: The 101st session of the Federal Assembly of the Federal Republic of Germany opened in Bonn on September 22nd. The agenda of the meeting included approximately twenty-five issues. However, the members of the Federal Assembly and the entire West German society focused on the first item on the agenda – a statement by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the results of the negotiations between the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Federal Chancellor Adenauer delivered a statement on behalf of the government. Adenauer pointed out that although there were huge differences in the Moscow negotiations caused by the results of the Second World War, the negotiations were open and honest. He pointed out the benefits of the negotiations for easing international tensions and resolving the German question.

Adenauer said: It is impossible to seek a solution to the German question, especially the unification of Germany, without establishing normal relations with the Soviet Union. He said: It would be unwise for us to reject the Soviet government's proposal to establish diplomatic relations. Adenauer added that the establishment of diplomatic relations does not mean that the Federal Republic government will abandon the foreign policy direction it has been pursuing. At the same time, Adenauer emphasized that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany does not conflict with the "interests of the West," but is in line with those interests. Adenauer also spoke about the issue of releasing Germans still in the Soviet Union who had been sentenced for crimes.

When Adenauer spoke about the unification of Germany, he emphasized the responsibility of the Four Powers to resolve this issue, but he ignored an undeniable principle: the unification of Germany is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves, and therefore requires an agreement between the Germans of the two Germanys.

A considerable part of Adenauer's statement dealt with the so-called "reservations" of the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

In his statement, Adenauer vehemently attacked the German Democratic Republic and threatened those countries that are willing to establish diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic. He said: The Federal Republic of Germany will regard such actions as unfriendly moves.

Referring to the "Treaty on Relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the German Democratic Republi" signed in Moscow, Adenauer insisted that this treaty could not change the current status of the German Democratic Republic, nor did it give it sovereignty. He also attempted to prove that the fact that the negotiations stipulated that the German Democratic Republic has the right to protect and control its borders, especially the right to resolve issues related to traffic between West Berlin and West Germany, is a violation of the relevant agreements between the victorious powers.

Adenauer finally suggested that the Federal Assembly approve the results of the Moscow negotiations between the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

    阿登纳就苏联和西德谈判结果发表声明
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社驻波恩特派记者报道：德意志联邦共和国联邦议院第一百零一次会议九月二十二日在波恩开幕。会议议程包括大约二十五个问题。但是联邦议院的议员们和整个西德的社会人士集中注意的是第一项议程——德意志联邦共和国政府就苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团谈判结果发表的声明。
    联邦总理阿登纳代表政府发表声明。阿登纳指出，在莫斯科谈判过程中，虽然出现了由于第二次世界大战的结果而引起的巨大的分歧，但是谈判是开诚布公的。他指出了谈判对于缓和国际紧张局势和解决德国问题的利益。
    阿登纳说：不同苏联建立正常关系，就不可能谋求德国问题，特别是统一德国的问题的解决。他说：如果我们拒绝苏联政府关于建立外交关系的建议，那是不明智的。阿登纳补充说，建立外交关系并不意味着联邦共和国政府放弃它到现在一直执行的外交政策方针。同时，阿登纳着重指出：建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的外交关系同“西方的利益”并不抵触，而是符合这种利益的。阿登纳还讲到关于释放现在仍然留在苏联的、由于犯罪而被处刑的德国人的问题。
    阿登纳讲到统一德国的问题时，着重指出了四大国对于解决这个问题的责任，但是他忽略了一个无可争辩的原则：德国的统一首先是德国人民自己的事情，因此需要两个德国的德国人之间达成协议。
    阿登纳的声明有相当大一部分讲到德意志联邦共和国政府代表团的所谓“保留条件”的问题。
    阿登纳在他的声明中猛烈攻击德意志民主共和国，并且对愿意同德意志民主共和国建立外交关系的那些国家进行威胁。他说：德意志联邦共和国将认为这种行动是不友好的举动。
    阿登纳在谈到在莫斯科签订的“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志民主共和国关系条约”时，硬说这个条约不能改变德意志民主共和国目前的地位，而且也没有给它以主权。他还企图证明，谈判结果所规定的德意志民主共和国有保护和管制其国境的权利，特别是有解决同西柏林和西德之间的交通问题有关的问题的权利这一点，是违反战胜国之间的有关协定的。
    阿登纳最后建议联邦议院批准苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团莫斯科谈判的结果。
