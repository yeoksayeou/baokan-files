    The talks between the Soviet Union and Finland on further developing and consolidating friendly relations between the two countries, which began in Moscow on September 16, concluded successfully on the 19th. The significant results achieved in this meeting through the joint efforts of the Soviet and Finnish governments are a concrete manifestation of the Geneva spirit. They not only conform to the fundamental interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Finland, but will also have a profound impact on the cause of strengthening international cooperation and consolidating world peace, which cannot be fully estimated.
    According to the protocol signed by the Soviet Union and Finland, the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance concluded in 1948 will be extended for another twenty years. It is well known that the Soviet-Finnish Treaty, which runs through the spirit of complete equality between the two countries, has played a very important role in consolidating the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland. As Soviet Minister of the Council of Ministers Bulganin pointed out in his speech at the meeting, the good relations between the Soviet Union and Finland in the post-war era are based on this treaty. According to this treaty, the two countries have established friendly relations under the principles of mutual respect for national sovereignty and independence and non-interference in internal affairs, and have developed and strengthened economic and cultural ties. It is quite obvious that the extension of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty will promote the further development of Soviet-Finnish friendly relations.
    During the talks, the two governments also signed an agreement on the Soviet Union's abandonment of the Porkkala-Udd Naval Base. People remember that after the end of World War II, in order to consolidate the victory of the anti-fascist war and to prevent foreign aggressive forces from using Finland's geographical convenience to launch an attack on the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union leased the Porkkala-Udd Naval Base for a period of fifty years in accordance with the 1947 Soviet-Finnish Treaty. This measure was absolutely necessary at the time. Now that a friendly and good-neighborly relationship has been formed between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the international situation has begun to ease, the Soviet government has abandoned its lease on this base ahead of schedule. This action by the Soviet government fully reflects its respect for Finnish sovereignty and its trust in the Finnish people. The Soviet government's proactive policy of peaceful diplomacy has once again been vividly demonstrated here.
    It can be seen that the aforementioned protocol and agreement are fully in line with the common interests of the two peoples. The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and Finland is a capitalist country, but this difference does not preclude the consistency of the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and it does not preclude the peaceful coexistence of the two countries. Finland pursued an independent policy after the war, refused to join a military bloc aimed at opposing the Soviet Union, and established friendly relations with the Soviet Union. As a result of pursuing this policy, the Finnish people have been able to avoid the burden of arms expansion and war preparation, which has helped to normalize the Finnish economy. There is no doubt that the further consolidation and strengthening of Soviet-Finnish cooperation will provide new possibilities for Finland to develop a peaceful economy; this is also a strong guarantee for maintaining Finland's national independence and national sovereignty.
    The positive achievements of the Soviet-Finnish talks not only consolidated the friendship between the two countries and guaranteed the security of Northern Europe, but also helped to strengthen international cooperation and consolidate world peace. The harmonious relations established between the Soviet Union and Finland under the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and mutual respect for national sovereignty and national independence have set a good example for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. This relationship convincingly proves that if Western countries can accept and follow this principle in their international activities, then it is entirely possible to guarantee the peaceful life of the people of all countries and the development of equal and friendly relations between countries throughout the historical period.
    The Geneva spirit shown by the Soviet government in this meeting in strengthening Soviet-Finnish cooperation and further enhancing the friendly relations between the two countries is a new contribution to further easing international tensions. The peace-loving people of the world are satisfied to see that after the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the Soviet government first and continuously uses concrete actions to realize the Geneva spirit, improve the atmosphere that has been poisoned by the "Cold War" policy for a long time, and strengthen trust between countries. In August, the Soviet government decided to reduce the Soviet armed forces by 640,000 by the end of this year. The recent negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany on the establishment of diplomatic relations will play a major role in promoting contact between East and West Germany and promoting the establishment of a European collective security system.
    Now, the Soviet Union has taken the lead in abandoning the only military base it owns in a foreign country. People should see how irresistible this action is in promoting further easing of the situation. For several years, the United States has been establishing a network of military bases everywhere, and even a network of atomic military bases, with certain countries as imaginary enemies. It is well known that the establishment of such a military base network is not for defense at all. The Soviet Union's abandonment of the Porkkala-Udd base to realize the Geneva spirit is a clear example that the United States should learn from.
    It should be pointed out that in Western countries, there are still many people who endlessly distort the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. When commenting on the Soviet-Finnish talks, some American news agencies interpreted the Soviet Union's voluntary abandonment of the lease of the Porkkala-Udd Naval Base as the Soviet Union wanting to obtain "propaganda benefits;" it was because of "modern warfare"—that is, atomic warfare—that the Soviet Union did not need to retain this naval base. These arguments, which deliberately belittle the Soviet Union's actions, prove that they are still accustomed to considering issues from the perspective of the "Cold War" and want to cover up the United States' unwillingness to abandon military bases. However, most of the newspapers in Western countries cannot but admit the Soviet Union's sincere desire to improve the international situation. The Swedish "Morning Post" wrote that the Soviet Union's generous proposal to voluntarily abandon the Porkkala-Udd Naval Base "will open up a wider path for easing international tensions."
    The Chinese people warmly welcome the positive results achieved in this Soviet-Finnish meeting. People have reason to demand that Western countries make the same efforts, especially to withdraw all military bases on foreign territories, so as to strengthen trust between countries and promote the further easing of the international situation.

### 苏芬会谈的重大成就

    苏芬会谈的重大成就
    九月十六日在莫斯科开始的苏联和芬兰之间关于进一步发展和巩固两国友好关系的会谈，已于十九日圆满结束。由于苏芬两国政府的共同努力而在这次会谈中取得的重大成果，是日内瓦精神的具体表现。它不仅符合于苏芬两国人民的根本利益，而且对于加强国际合作和巩固世界和平的事业，也将发生难以充分估计的深远影响。
    根据苏芬两国所签订的议定书，一九四八年缔结的苏芬友好合作互助条约，将继续延长二十年。人所共知，贯穿着两国完全平等精神的苏芬条约，在巩固苏联和芬兰的友好关系中，起了十分重要的作用。正如苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在会谈发言中所指出的，苏联和芬兰在战后年代中的良好关系，是以这个条约为基础的。根据这个条约，两国在互相尊重国家主权和独立以及互不干涉内政的原则下，建立了友好的关系，并发展和加强了经济、文化方面的联系。十分明显，苏芬条约的延长，将会促进苏芬友好关系的进一步发展。
    在这次会谈中，两国政府还签订了关于苏联放弃使用波卡拉乌德海军基地的协定。人们记得，第二次世界大战结束以后，为了巩固反法西斯战争的胜利，为了防止外来侵略势力利用芬兰地理上的便利向苏联发动进攻，苏联根据一九四七年的苏芬和约，以五十年的期限租借了波卡拉乌德海军基地。这一措施，在当时是完全必要的。现在，苏联和芬兰之间既然已经形成了友好睦邻关系，同时国际局势又已开始缓和，因此苏联政府就提前放弃了对这一基地的租借权。苏联政府的这一行动，充分体现了它对芬兰主权的尊重和对芬兰人民的信赖。苏联政府主动的和平外交政策，在这里又一次得到了生动的证明。
    可以看出，上述的议定书和协定，是完全符合于两国人民的共同利益的。苏联是社会主义国家，芬兰是资本主义国家，但是这种差别，并不排斥两国人民在根本利益上的一致性，同时，更不排斥两国和平共处。芬兰在战后奉行独立政策，拒绝了参加旨在反对苏联的军事集团，而同苏联建立了友好的关系。奉行这种政策的结果，使芬兰人民得以避免扩军备战的负担，有助于芬兰经济走向正常化。毫无疑问，苏芬两国合作的进一步巩固和加强，将为芬兰发展和平经济提供新的可能；这对于维护芬兰的民族独立和国家主权，也是有力的保障。
    苏芬会谈所取得的积极成就，不仅巩固了两国之间的友谊，保障了欧洲北部的安全，并且有助于加强国际合作和巩固世界和平。苏芬两国在互不干涉内政、互相尊重国家主权和民族独立这一原则下所建立的和睦关系，为不同社会制度国家可以和平共处树立了良好的榜样。这种关系令人信服地证明，西方国家如果能在自己的国际活动中接受和遵循这一原则，那么就完全有可能在整个的历史时期中保障各国人民的和平生活，保障国与国之间的平等友好关系的发展。
    苏联政府在这次会谈中，对于加强苏芬合作、进一步增进两国的友好关系上所表现的日内瓦精神，是对进一步缓和国际紧张局势的又一个新的贡献。全世界爱好和平人民满意地看到，在日内瓦四国首脑会议之后，苏联政府首先并且连续不断地用具体行动来实现日内瓦精神，改善被“冷战”政策所长期毒化了的气氛，加强国与国之间的信任。苏联政府在八月间作出决定，将苏联武装部队在本年年底以前裁减六十四万人。最近苏联同德意志联邦共和国关于建立外交关系的谈判，对于促进德国东西部的接触、促进欧洲集体安全体系的建立，将发生极大的作用。
    现在，苏联又首先放弃了它在外国拥有的唯一的军事基地。人们应该看到这种行动对于进一步和缓局势是怎样不可抗拒的推动力。几年来，美国以某些国家为假想敌国，到处建立军事基地网，甚至建立原子军事基地网的活动，是使国际局势紧张，使世界人民忧虑不安的重要原因之一。建立这种军事基地网完全不是为了防御，这是人所共知的。苏联为实现日内瓦精神而放弃波卡拉乌德基地，就是美国应该学习的鲜明榜样。
    应该指出，在西方国家中，对于苏联的和平政策喋喋不休地进行歪曲的，仍然并不乏人。美国的某些通讯社在评论苏芬会谈时，把苏联主动放弃波卡拉乌德海军基地的租借权，解释为苏联是想取得“宣传上的利益”；是因为“现代化的战争”——即原子战争，才使得苏联没有必要保有这个海军基地。这些故意贬低苏联的行动的论调，证明他们还是习惯于从“冷战”的利益来考虑问题，想掩盖美国不愿放弃军事基地的用意。但是，西方国家中大部分的报纸，都不能不承认苏联谋求改善国际局势的诚挚愿望。瑞典的“晨报”写道，苏联主动放弃波卡拉乌德海军基地的慷慨建议，“将替国际紧张局势的缓和打开更加宽阔的道路。”
    中国人民热烈欢迎这次苏芬会谈所取得的积极成果。人们有理由要求西方国家作同样的努力，特别是撤消一切在外国领土上的军事基地，以便加强国与国之间的信任，促使国际局势的进一步缓和。
