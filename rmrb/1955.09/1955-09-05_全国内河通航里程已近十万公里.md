    National Inland Waterway Navigable Mileage Nears 100,000 Kilometers
    To date, the national inland waterway navigable mileage has reached nearly 100,000 kilometers, an increase of 30% compared to 1949. Among them, more than 30,000 kilometers are navigable by ships.
    The night navigation fleets on the Yangtze River can now safely travel between Shanghai and Chongqing. Since 1953, the surveying and dredging work of the Sichuan River section of the upper Yangtze River has been actively carried out, and many secrets of the riverbed have been revealed. This section of the waterway will be thoroughly transformed. This project already started last year. Now, the unified dispatch telephone line for the entire Yangtze River has been installed, and some new pontoons and warehouses have been built in important ports along the river, and the existing ones have also been renovated.
    The scenery on the Songhua River is now even more beautiful than in previous years. At night, automatic marker lights are scattered along the waterway for night navigation vessels on the Songhua River; many wharves on the river have been renovated, and mechanized loading and unloading equipment has replaced some of the heavy manual labor. The section from Taolai Zhao to Fuyu, which had many shoals and shallow water, has been dredged and more than 20 shoals have been removed, so that ships can now pass smoothly.
    In terms of the Grand Canal, except for a small section near the Yellow River in the middle section that is still not navigable, the entire Grand Canal is now navigable. A comprehensive survey, in preparation for further dredging of the Grand Canal, has also begun.
    In addition, the Pearl River waterway has begun and will continue to be dredged. Before the summer this year, Sichuan Province dredged 23 rivers including the Jialing River and the Min River on a large scale. Small and medium-sized rivers in many remote areas without railways and highways, especially in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, have also been dredged, and some rivers that were never navigable before can now be navigated.

    全国内河通航里程已近十万公里
    到目前为止，全国内河通航里程已近十万公里，比一九四九年增加了百分之三十。其中可以通行轮船的有三万多公里。
    长江上的夜航船队现在已能安全地往来于上海和重庆之间。从一九五三年起，长江上游川江航道的勘测、整治工作就已积极进行，江底的许多秘密都被揭破了。这一带航道将被彻底进行改造。这项工程去年已经开始。现在长江全线的统一调度电话已装设完毕，沿线重要港口已修建了一些新的趸船和仓库，原有的也经过了整修。
    松花江上的景色现在也比往年更加美丽。夜晚，自动标志灯星星点点地分布在松花江夜航船舶的道路上；江上许多码头都已经过整修，机械化的装卸设备代替了一部分笨重的体力操作。陶赖昭到扶余的滩多水浅的一段，经过疏浚并挖除了二十多个浅滩后，船舶已畅通无阻。
    在运河方面，现在除了中段靠黄河附近还有一小段不通航外，运河已全部通航。为进一步整治运河作准备的全面勘测工作也已开始进行。
    此外，珠江航道已开始并将继续进行整治。四川省在今年入夏以前，大规模地疏浚了嘉陵江、岷江等二十三条河道。许多不通铁路和公路的边远地区，特别是少数民族聚居地区的中小河流也经过了疏浚，若干从来不能通航的河流，现在都能通航。　（新华社）
