Criticizing Liang Shuming's Vitalist Philosophy
	Tang Yongtong Ren Jiyu

Around the time of the May Fourth Movement, a large number of feudal restorationist ideas emerged: the *Xueheng* magazine opposed vernacular Chinese; Kang Youwei clamored for making Confucius the leader of a religion; from Yuan Shikai to Cao Kun and Duan Qirui, all advocated worshiping Confucius and reading the classics; Hu Shi also used the excuse of "organizing the national heritage" to lure young people into piles of old papers; Ouyang Jingwu used the Zhina Inner Academy as a base for promoting Buddhist idealism. This reactionary and backward trend, as attacked by Mr. Lu Xun, aimed to turn China into a large "antique" devoid of life. This reactionary countercurrent precisely demonstrated that under the enormous power of the New Culture Movement, dying reactionary ideas were attempting a final counterattack.

If we examine this countercurrent around the May Fourth Movement within the context of the global anti-Marxist philosophical countercurrent at the time, it becomes easier to see its reactionary role.

The establishment of the Soviet Union inspired and supported the national revolutionary movements in Eastern colonies and dependent countries. The upsurge of Eastern national revolutionary movements directly shook the rear of imperialism. On a global scale, imperialism faced economic depression and political crises. They dared not look forward, but only fantasized about finding life-saving prescriptions in medieval feudalism and religious superstition.

The various idealist schools of thought prevalent in Western capitalist countries at the time shared a common characteristic of anti-rationalism. Such as James and Dewey's pragmatism, Kropotkin's "mutual aid", Bergson and Eucken's vitalism, Driesch's mysterious "entelechy", Russell's "impulse", coupled with Schopenhauer and Nietzsche's blind subjective will doctrines from the last century, these poisonous idealist thoughts formed a countercurrent of anti-rationalism. When these ideas spread to semi-feudal and semi-colonial China at the time, they provided a theoretical basis for the rule of imperialism and feudalism in China. Liang Shuming's reactionary philosophy, under the influence of the global anti-rationalist idealist philosophical countercurrent, coordinated with the domestic restorationist countercurrent to promote "Confucian spirit" and "Chinese culture."

Liang Shuming and those various restorationists, with the same purpose, attempted to use the so-called "Confucian spirit" and "Chinese culture" to strengthen the decaying "four thick ropes" (see Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan") that bound the people.

But as Chairman Mao said: "In economically backward semi-colonial China, the landlord class and the comprador class are entirely appendages of the international bourgeoisie, and their survival and development are dependent on imperialism." ("Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society") Since Liang Shuming was loyal to feudalism and hostile to Marxism, he was bound to prostrate himself at the feet of imperialism and become their pawn. If we examine Liang Shuming's philosophy, it perfectly proves this point. Liang Shuming's "Confucian spirit" and "Chinese culture" not only absorbed the anti-rationalist dross of Chinese feudal culture, but also absorbed a large amount of anti-rationalist toxins from Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Bergson, Driesch, Russell, Eucken, Kropotkin, etc., with Bergson being the most important.

Liang Shuming's reactionary political views are based on his subjective idealist world outlook. He believes:

	"The universe is a great life; the evolution of
	organisms and the evolution of human society are
	both manifestations of the development of this
	great life." ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese
	National Self-Salvation Movement," page 369)
Liang Shuming believes that this mysterious "great life" is also human "life":

	"The entire universe is a life, only life, and there
	was no universe in the beginning. Because life
	continues, the universe seems to be constant...The
	universe is actually established upon life and exists
	by relying on life." ("Eastern and Western Cultures
	and Their Philosophies," page 48)
According to Liang Shuming, the world is a "great life", the evolution of organisms and the development of human society are determined by culture, culture is determined by "will", and "will" is the expression of this "great life". That is to say, the world itself, society itself, and the biological world are not objective existences, but only exist because of the existence of the "great life". The vitalist school believes that the world is not a material existence, and the essence of the world is only "great potential or great demand or great will—endless will". They attempt to obliterate the material world and spiritualize and mystify it. Apart from the activities of the human brain, there is actually an independently existing "great demand" and "great will". This is truly unimaginable for a normal person who believes in science. Liang Shuming's world view is precisely built on this unimaginable and mysterious foundation.

The vitalists put forward a "great will" that has no material basis and is above everything else, and from this they further arrogantly deny universally recognized common sense. They insist that matter hinders the development of the world. They often say that the material world is the source of all "sins", "degeneration", and "stagnation". Liang Shuming said that the material world itself can only generate "downward impulses". In order to avoid the material world from causing human's "downward impulses", only allow the "blind will impulse" and "great will" to develop as much as possible, and use this "upward impulse" to resist the "downward impulse". The vitalists want to use "spirit" to overcome "matter", and in fact, they are using "life" and "spirit" to replace matter. Therefore, he described "life" and "will" as "a kind of struggle and effort of 'the present me' against 'the previous me'" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 49). The so-called "present me" is "heart" or "spirit", and the so-called "previous me" is matter. This reactionary school of subjective idealism is fanatically hostile to materialism. Like the clericalists of ancient times, they clearly carry out bone-scraping exploitation of the hungry and cold working people, but they shout about despising material things; they cannot be separated from greed and enjoyment for a moment, and often rely on wealthy families and nobles, but they shout about "going out of the world." In Liang Shuming's "Rural Reconstruction School", in one room, peasants were tortured, and in another room, peasants were told about the highest realm of "all things are one" and "benevolence."

The issue is very clear. Liang Shuming's vitalist philosophy believes that the "universe" exists because of the "great life" and "life". Obviously, "life" is primary, and the existence of the universe is secondary. What is truly eternally existing is not matter, but "life".

Marxists believe that "life" is a form of motion of matter, and it is a necessary product of the development of matter to a certain stage; life is the activity process of organisms maintaining their lives. For human beings, life is social practice, which includes practical activities such as the struggle for production, class struggle, and scientific research under the historical conditions of a certain social development. But Liang Shuming confuses the life phenomena of the biological world and the "life" of human society: "life" is life, and life is life. He mystifies a baffling "great life" and regards it as the power to create everything.

Liang Shuming not only obliterates the boundaries between humans and general organisms (animals and plants), but even obliterates the distinction between living and non-living things. He adds a mysterious "life" or "living" to everything. They regard the entire world as a "great life", a mysterious life. The life they refer to does not require any material basis. On the contrary, the existence of matter depends on this supernatural force that promotes the occurrence and development of nature. The universe is based on life, and the universe exists by relying on life. Therefore, the "life" they refer to is an anti-common sense and anti-scientific force of final creation.

This school regards the emotional function in the individual's psychological state as the essence of "great life," which is what they call "benevolence." They regard the ethical relationships of Chinese feudal society as eternal relationships and call this feudal morality true "life." Idealist philosophers often say that "benevolence" is "the heart of heaven and earth." Liang Shuming also absolutely supports Wang Yangming's subjective idealist fallacy that "grass, trees, tiles, and stones also have human conscience." They regard the chaotic, mysterious, and unspeakable "life" as the source of the world, which is to swallow the objective world with subjective consciousness.

Such a reactionary doctrine of vitalism can also be found in abundance in the garbage heap of China's decadent feudal culture. In ancient times, it can be traced back to Mencius. The most obvious example is Cheng Hao and his disciples in the Northern Song Dynasty. This school openly promoted vitalism and caused quite widespread harmful effects in the history of Chinese philosophy.

Cheng Hao and his disciples talked about "benevolence" and put forward a new (but corrupt) explanation. They said that "benevolence" is the "kernel" of peach kernels and apricot kernels. Peach kernels and apricot kernels are the roots of peach trees and apricot trees. Only with peach kernels can there be peach trees, and only with apricot kernels can there be apricot trees. Therefore, peach kernels and apricot kernels are the prerequisites for the existence of peach trees and apricot trees. Based on the "kernels" of peach trees and apricot trees, this school subjectively sought the origin of the world. They believed that human "benevolence" is the all-encompassing life force between heaven and earth. Only with "benevolence" can there be mankind and the world. They believe that the ethical order of Chinese feudal society embodies "benevolence," and even the spring growth, summer growth, autumn harvest, and winter storage of nature embody "benevolence." This mysterious and great force is "the heart of heaven and earth," the source of the world, and the ultimate driving force for the growth and change of things.

In semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, any feudal ideological system inevitably had to bring out the ideological system of imperialism to support itself. Liang Shuming is not only a stubborn restorationist, but also a comprador scholar who maintains the interests of imperialism. He mixed the doctrine of "life" in feudalism with the vitalist doctrine of the imperialist scholar Bergson.

Liang Shuming relayed Bergson's ideas and said:

	"The essence of the universe is not a fixed static
	body, but 'life' and 'duration'..." ("Eastern and
	Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 79)
Liang Shuming's vitalism is also a replica of these reactionary vitalist doctrines. He said:

	"This word 'life' is an important concept. Knowing
	this, you can know all the words of Confucius...He
	(referring to Confucius - author) believed that the
	universe is always developing forward, and all things
	desire to live. If you let them live without adding
	artificiality, they will surely be in harmony with the
	universe, making the entire universe full of life and
	spring." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their
	Philosophies," page 121)
The "life" here is also the "benevolence" that Liang Shuming talks about elsewhere. Like other feudal philosophers, Liang Shuming believes that "benevolence" is not only a law commonly followed by oppressors and the oppressed in society, but also a law of nature. He interprets the unreasonable order of oppression in old China as a universal order.

Liang Shuming's vitalist philosophy inherits and develops the idealist tradition of Song and Ming dynasty Neo-Confucianism and the subjective idealist doctrine of Wang Yangming. In his article "The Great Learning," Wang Yangming fully elaborated on the subjective idealist doctrine of the mysterious "unity of all things." Liang Shuming everywhere expounds on Wang Yangming's fallacies of "heaven and earth and all things are one with human beings" and "grass, trees, tiles, and stones also have human conscience." He believes that the universe itself is a great life, and there is no objective world without human conscience. He wants people not to distinguish between each other, but to be "one with human beings."

The vitalist world view is subjective idealism. In terms of epistemology, it must also deny that the source of knowledge has an objective material basis. They believe that we cannot know the objective world that exists independently of our consciousness, but can only reflect on our own hearts. Because according to him, there is no objective world that exists independently of people's consciousness. Mr. Liang Shuming's so-called knowing the "essence" is knowing the "great life," and this great life is flowing and "enduring" (he fully agrees with Bergson's vitalist philosophy). This mysterious realm "cannot be handled by sensation and intellect, but only by the intuition of life. Intuition is life, and it is a fusion into one, without subject or object, which can be called absolute." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," page 79) This mysterious great life cannot be known by mankind through the scientific path of knowledge, but only by the unspeakable "intuition of life."

Since this school of philosophy denies the source of knowledge, it must also deny the possibility of knowledge. They regard knowledge as the process of oneself knowing oneself, so Mr. Liang Shuming repeatedly said that knowledge should be "without opposition" (knowledge without an objective object), and should be "reflecting on oneself and being sincere" and "exerting effort internally." If Mr. Liang Shuming also uses the word knowledge, it is only to tell people to know "life." His "life" refers to the life under the feudal exploitation system order that he respects and is hostile to the people.

Science must be based on materialism, but vitalism fundamentally denies the materiality of the objective world; the laws of science are the laws of the development of the objective world, but the vitalist school denies the possibility of knowing the objective world; science and reason are inseparable, but vitalism openly opposes reason, believing that reason (Liang calls reason intellect) cannot know their so-called "great life" at all. The common characteristic of Mr. Liang Shuming and all intuitionist schools is that it openly opposes reason, opposes science, and opposes analysis. They believe that the "reason" that cannot be said is the most "Tao", as long as you "feel at peace in your heart" then "you are right", if you subjectively feel that something must be done, then do it, this behavior is right. Yang Jian, an intuitionist in the Song Dynasty, often said, "The human heart is self-evident, and the human heart is self-aware." Buddhist Zen monks often use a mysterious metaphor to promote their intuitionist epistemology. They often say, "Like a person drinking water, he knows himself whether it is cold or warm." That is to say, in knowledge, there is no objective standard for truth, falsehood, right, and wrong. If you have to find a standard, it is each person's own subjective consciousness. This intuitionism must be mysticism. They oppose the possibility of obtaining truth through scientific methods. They do not recognize the only scientific process of knowledge from perceptual to rational knowledge. They oppose objective truth. They believe that as long as you "have a clear conscience," you are not afraid of "harming heaven and reason." Acting according to instinct without rational thinking is the most "reasonable" action.

In the 20th century, an era of flourishing science, the reactionary class, in order to oppose Marxism, moved out that set of decadent terms from ancient and medieval times, and polished it to make it smoother, attempting to cover up its anti-scientific and anti-rational face. Liang Shuming here raises his "rationality" to cover up his anti-rational essence. He said:

	Twenty-seven years ago, I did not recognize reason and
	agreed with Kropotkin's theory that morality came from
	instinct, and disagreed with Russell's distinction
	between instinct, intellect, and spirituality. It was not
	until I realized reason and the necessity of separating
	intellect that I suddenly realized that Russell's
	three-point method was an unchanging theory. - Russell's
	so-called spirituality is equivalent to what I call reason.
	("The Essentials of Chinese Culture," page 348)
That is to say, twenty-seven years ago, he did not know how to use the term "reason" to deceive people. In the past twenty-seven years, under the widespread influence of Marxism, more and more people have recognized the importance of science, democracy, and reason, and intuitionism has become increasingly unable to deceive people. Therefore, Liang Shuming usurped the appealing term "reason" believed by the progressive masses and injected it with the idealist content of intuitionism. Liang Shuming's so-called "reason" is a psychological state, an emotion, not the correct knowledge proven by scientific analysis and practice. He said:

	"The so-called reason is nothing more than our calm
	and understanding psychology." ("The Essentials of
	Chinese Culture," page 135) He also said:

	"The intellectual side is called intellect; the emotional
	side is called reason." ("The Essentials of Chinese
	Culture," page 138)
	"That which does not deceive likes and dislikes and
	judges naturally and clearly is called reason." ("The
	Essentials of Chinese Culture," page 141)
	"The choices of reason are not uniform, but it must be
	centered on selfless emotions." ("The Essentials of
	Chinese Culture," page 138)
According to Liang Shuming, the mysterious power generated by this "selfless emotion" and "calm and understanding psychology" is inestimable. It is not only the "characteristic of human beings," but also the only force that "promotes history, dominates society, and controls life." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture," page 348)

Liang Shuming replaced the rational scientific analysis with emotional intuition. He replaced the objective standard of judging right and wrong with a subjective psychological state. He replaced the practice of testing the truth with subjective intuition of likes and dislikes. The "reason" they speak of has actually become a substitute for "God," because as long as you rely on "selfless emotions" and "calm and understanding psychology," you can actually "promote history, dominate society, and control life." What is it if it is not an incomprehensible and omnipotent God?

This reactionary tradition of vitalism was also developed by Zeng Guofan, a traitor at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The heads of the Kuomintang bandit gang, Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Lifu, further combined this reactionary tradition with the vitalist philosophy of imperialism to create the extremely reactionary "Vitalism." They believe that the development of the universe and the development of society are driven by a mysterious and irresistible life force. The development of the world is caused by blind impulses, and there are no laws. As long as you sincerely believe in this reactionary philosophy, it will produce an inexplicable force of reckless action, which will produce what they call "revolutionary" (should be called counter-revolutionary) actions. These fascist bandits believe that as long as they act blindly (what they call "vigorous action"), they are realizing the principles of life, which is what they call "the meaning of life." The fascist bandits said, "The meaning of life lies in creating the universe and continuing life." They equated people and animals completely, saying, "People are animals that fight for survival," and "They are born with an upward impulse." This primitive animalistic "struggle for survival" and "upward impulse" are regarded as the driving force for the development of the world.

Liang Shuming just happened to be singing the same tune. He said: "People's lives are not all conscious. Like animals, they are based on instinct and impulse." ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies" page 170) He also said, "Desire" and "impulse" are "the source of human behavior" ("Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies" page 170). "The evolution of human society is nothing more than following the evolution of biology; the two are both manifestations of the great life of the universe, and the former is actually a continuation of the latter." ("The Essentials of Chinese Culture," page 43)

From the above examples, it is not difficult for us to see that from the two Chengs of the Northern Song Dynasty, Wang Yangming, Zeng Guofan, to Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Lifu, this series of vitalist philosophies all claim to have inherited Chinese culture. If it is called "Chinese culture," then it is the most reactionary feudal dross in Chinese culture. And this reactionary tradition of vitalist philosophy is precisely what Mr. Liang Shuming regards as the treasure and respects as the "essentials" of "Chinese culture."

These fundamental views of Liang Shuming are not only the same in terms of words and phrases as the "Vitalism" philosophy of Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Lifu, but are completely consistent in spiritual essence. Just as Hu Shi served Chiang Kai-shek and imperialism with his pragmatism, Liang Shuming served Chiang Kai-shek and imperialism with his vitalist philosophy. This point is also the same.

    批判梁漱溟的生命主义哲学
    汤用彤　任继愈
    “五四”前后，曾经出现了大批的封建复古主义的思想：学衡杂志反对白话文；康有为叫嚣以孔子为教主；从袁世凯到曹锟、段祺瑞都提倡祀孔和读经；胡适也在借口“整理国故”引诱青年钻入故纸堆；欧阳竟无以支那内院作为宣传佛教唯心论的基地。这种复古、守旧的邪风正如鲁迅先生所攻击的，非把中国变成一个丧失生命的大“古董”不止。这一反动的逆流，正是表示在新文化运动的巨大威力下，垂死的反动思想企图作最后的反扑。
    如果把当时五四前后的这一股逆流放在当时全世界的反马克思主义的哲学逆流中来考查，就更容易看清楚它的反动作用。
    苏联的建立，鼓舞和支持了东方殖民地及附属国的民族革命运动。东方民族革命运动的高涨直接震撼了帝国主义的大后方。在全世界范围内帝国主义面临着经济萧条和政治的危机，他们不敢向前看，只有妄想在中古封建主义、宗教迷信中找寻救命的药方。
    当时西方资本主义国家所流行的唯心主义学派都带有反理性主义的共同特色。像詹姆士和杜威的实验主义、克鲁泡特金的“互助论”、柏格森和倭铿的生命主义、杜里舒的神秘莫测的“隐德来希”、罗素的“冲动”，加上上世纪的叔本华、尼采的盲目主观的意志学说，这些唯心主义的毒害思想形成了一股反理性主义的逆流。这些思想传播到当时半封建半殖民地的中国来，给帝国主义和封建主义在中国的统治建立理论根据。梁漱溟的反动哲学就是在全世界反理性主义的唯心主义哲学逆流的影响下，配合了当时国内的复古主义的逆流，来宣扬“孔子精神”和“中国文化”的。
    梁漱溟和当时那些形形色色的复古主义者抱着同样的目的，都企图用所谓“孔子精神”和“中国文化”来加强那腐朽欲断的束缚人民的“四大绳索”（参看毛主席的“湖南农民运动考查报告”）。
    但正如毛主席所说，“在经济落后的半殖民地的中国，地主阶级和买办阶级完全是国际资产阶级的附庸，其生存和发展，是附属于帝国主义的。”（“中国社会各阶级的分析”）梁漱溟既然为封建主义效忠，对马克思主义仇视，他势必匍匐在帝国主义的脚下，做他们的走卒。我们试检查一下梁漱溟的哲学，恰好证明了这一点。梁漱溟所讲的“孔子精神”和“中国文化”一方面吸取了中国封建文化的反理性主义的糟粕，一方面也大量吸取了叔本华、尼采、柏格森、杜里舒、罗素、倭铿、克鲁泡特金等人的反理性主义的毒素，其中柏格森更是主要的。
    梁漱溟反动的政治观点是以他的主观唯心主义的世界观作为理论基础的。他认为：
    “宇宙为一大生命；生物进化与人类社会之进
    化同为此大生命之开展表现”。（“中国民族自
    救运动的最后觉悟”，三六九页）这一神秘的“大生命”，梁漱溟认为也就是人类的“生活”：
    “尽宇宙是一生活，只是生活，初无宇宙。由
    生活相续，故尔宇宙似乎恒在。……宇宙实成
    于生活之上，托乎生活而存者也。”（“东西文
    化及其哲学”，四十八页）照梁漱溟看来，世界是“大生命”，生物进化和人类社会发展是由文化决定的，文化是由“意欲”决定的，而“意欲”却是这一个“大生命”的表现。这就是说，世界本身、社会本身、以及生物界，都不是客观存在，而只是由于有了“大生命”的存在，它们才存在。生命派认为世界不是物质的存在，世界的本质只是“大潜力或大要求或大意欲——没尽的意欲”。他们企图抹煞物质世界，把物质世界精神化、神秘化。离开人类大脑的活动，居然还有独立存在的“大要求”、“大意欲”，这对于一个正常的、相信科学的人来说，实在是不可想像的。梁漱溟的世界观恰恰就是建立在这种不可想像的、神秘的基础上。
    生命主义者提出了没有物质基础的、超乎一切之上的“大意欲”，并且由此进一步狂妄地否认人所公认的常识。他们硬说，物质对世界发展起着妨害作用。他们经常说物质世界是产生一切“罪恶”“堕落”“停滞”的根源。梁漱溟说，物质世界本身就只能发生“向下的冲动”，为了避免物质世界引起人类的“向下的冲动”，只有让“盲目的意志冲动”“大意欲”尽量发展，用这种“向上的冲动”来抵制“向下的冲动”。生命主义者要用“精神”来克服“物质”，实际上就是用“生命”“精神”来代替物质。所以他把“生命”和“意欲”说成“‘现在的我’对于‘前此的我’之一种奋斗努力”（“东西文化及其哲学”，四十九页）。他所谓“现在的我”即是“心”或“精神”，所谓“前此的我”即物质。这一派反动的主观唯心主义的哲学敌视唯物主义达到疯狂的程度。他们和从古以来的僧侣主义者一样：分明向饥寒的劳动人民进行敲骨取髓的剥削，却叫喊着要轻视物质；他们一刻也离不开贪婪和享乐、经常依附于豪门贵族，却叫喊什么“出世”。梁漱溟的“乡农学校”里，一间屋子里对农民非刑拷打，另一间屋子里向农民讲“万物一体”和“仁”的最高境界。
    问题已很清楚，梁漱溟的生命主义哲学认为有了“大生命”，有了“生活”，才有“宇宙”。显然“生命”、“生活”是第一性的，而宇宙的存在是第二性的。真正永恒存在的，不是物质，而是“生命”。
    马克思主义者认为：“生命”是物质的一种运动形式，它是物质发展到了一定的阶段的必然的产物；生活是生物维持它的生命的活动过程，就人类来说，生活就是社会实践，它包括在一定的社会发展的历史条件下的生产斗争阶级斗争，科学研究等实践活动。而梁漱溟却把生物界的生命现象和人类社会的“生活”混同起来：“生命”也就是生活，生活也就是生命。把一个莫名其妙的“大生命”神秘化，把它当作创造一切的力量。
    梁漱溟不但抹煞了人同一般生物（动植物）的界限，甚至也抹煞了生物同无生物的区别，他把一切都给它加上神秘的“生命”或“生活”。他们把整个世界当作一个“大生命”，神秘的生命。他们所谓生命并不需要任何物质基础，相反地，物质的存在倒是要靠这一超自然的和推动自然发生发展的力量，宇宙以生命为基础，宇宙靠生命才存在。因此，他们所谓“生命”，乃是反常识、反科学的一种最后创造的力量。
    这一派，把个人的心理状态中的感情作用，看作“大生命”的实质，这就是他们所谓“仁”。他们把中国封建社会的伦理关系看作永恒的关系，把这种封建道德叫做真正的“生活”。唯心主义的理学家常说“仁”是“天地之心”，梁漱溟也绝对拥护王阳明的“草木瓦石也有人的良知”的主观唯心主义的谬说。他们把浑沌的、神秘的、不可言说的“生命”作为世界的根源，这也就是用主观意识吞没客观世界。
    像生命主义这样的反动学说，在中国陈腐的封建主义文化的垃圾堆中也可以找到不少。上古可以追溯到孟子。最明显的是北宋时期的程颢和他的门徒们。这一派，曾公开宣扬生命主义，并在中国哲学史上引起了相当广泛的毒害影响。
    程颢和他的门徒，讲“仁”，曾提出一个新的（但是腐朽的）说法。他们说，“仁”就是桃仁、杏仁的“仁”，桃仁、杏仁是桃树、杏树的根本，有了桃仁才有桃树，有了杏仁才有杏树，因此桃仁和杏仁是桃树和杏树存在的前提。他们这一派根据桃树、杏树的“仁”，进而主观地给世界找寻根源，他们认为人类的“仁”，乃是天地间无所不包的生命力量。有了“仁”才有人类，才有世界。他们认为中国的封建社会的伦理秩序，是体现了“仁”，甚至自然界的春生、夏长、秋收、冬藏也是体现了“仁”。这一种神秘伟大的力量是“天地的心”，是世界的根源，是事物生长、变化的最后的推动力量。
    在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，任何封建主义的思想体系，不可避免地要抬出帝国主义的思想体系替自己撑腰。梁漱溟不仅是一个顽固的复古主义者，而且是维护帝国主义的利益的买办学者。他把封建主义中宣扬“生命”的学说和帝国主义学者柏格森的生命派的学说混在一起。
    梁漱溟转述柏格森的思想说：
    “宇宙的本体不是固定的静体，是‘生命’是
    ‘绵延’……”（“东西文化及其哲学”，七
    十九页）梁漱溟的生命主义，也正是这些反动的生命学说的翻版。他说：
    “这一个‘生’字是重要的观念，知道这个就
    可以知道所有孔家的话。……他（指孔子——
    作者）以为宇宙总是向前生发的，万物欲生，
    即任其生，不加造作必能与宇宙契合，使全宇
    宙充满了生意春气。”（“东西文化及其哲学”，
    一二一页）这里的“生”，也就是梁漱溟在另外的地方讲的“仁”。梁漱溟和其他的封建主义的哲学家一样，认为“仁”是不但是社会上压迫者和被压迫者共同遵守的规律，也是自然界的规律。他把旧中国人压迫人不合理的秩序解释为普遍的秩序。
    梁漱溟的生命主义哲学继承并发扬了宋代理学的唯心论传统及明代王阳明的主观唯心主义的学说。王阳明在他的“大学问”一篇文章中充分发挥了神秘的“万物一体”的主观唯心主义的学说。梁漱溟到处发挥王阳明的“天地万物与人为一体”“草木瓦石也有人的良知”的谬说。他认为宇宙本身就是一个大生命，离开了人的良知就没有客观世界。他要人不要分别彼此，“与人为一体”。
    生命主义的世界观是主观唯心主义的，在认识论方面，也必然否认认识的来源有客观物质基础。他们认为，我们不可能认识独立于我们意识之外的客观世界，只能反观自己的内心。因为照他看来，根本没有独立于人们意识之外的客观世界。梁漱溟先生所谓认识“本体”，就是认识“大生命”，而这一大生命是流动的、是“绵延”（他完全同意柏格森的生命主义哲学），这一种神秘的境界，“非感觉理智所能办，必方生活的直觉才行，直觉时即生活时，浑融为一个，没有主客观的，可以称绝对。”（“东西文化及其哲学”，七十九页）这一神秘的大生命，人类不能通过科学的认识的道路去认识它，只有靠不可言说的“生活的直觉”才行。
    这一派的哲学，既然否认认识的来源，必然也否认认识的可能。他们把认识看做自己认识自己的过程，所以梁漱溟先生一再说认识要“无对”（没有客观对象的认识），要“反身而诚”“向内用力”。如果说梁漱溟先生也用认识这一词，那只是叫人认识“生活”。他的“生活”就是指的他所尊奉的与人民为敌的封建剥削制度秩序下的生活。
    科学必须建立在唯物主义的基础上，而生命主义根本否认客观世界的物质性；科学的规律就是客观世界发展的规律，而生命派却否认有认识客观世界的可能；科学和理性不可分，而生命主义公开反对理性，认为理性（梁称理性为理智）根本不能认识他们所谓“大生命”。梁漱溟先生以及一切直觉主义学派共同的特点，就在于它公开反对理性，反对科学，反对分析。他们认为说不出所以然的“道理”最有“道”，只要“心安”就“理得”，一件事情，只要主观上觉得非做不可，就去做，这种行为就是对的。宋代有一个直觉主义者杨简经常说“人心自明，人心自灵”。佛教禅宗的和尚常用一种神秘的比喻来宣扬他们的直觉主义的认识论，他们常说“如人饮水，冷暖自知”。这就是说，在认识上，真假、是非没有客观标准，如果硬要找寻标准，那就是每一个人自己的主观意识。这种直觉主义必然是神秘主义的。他们反对用科学方法获得真理的可能，他们不承认由感性到理性认识的唯一科学的认识过程。他们反对有客观真理。他们认为只要“问心无愧”，就不怕“伤天害理”，按照本能，不加理性思维的行动就是最“合理”的行动。
    在二十世纪，科学昌明的时代，反动的阶级为了反对马克思主义，他们搬用了古代及中古时期那一套陈腐的名词，并且把它修整得更平滑，企图掩盖它的反科学、反理性的面貌。梁漱溟在这里抬出他的“理性”，来掩盖他的反理性的实质。他说：
    二十七年前我亦还不认识理性，同意克鲁泡特
    金道德出于本能之说，而不同意罗素本能、理
    智、灵性之分法。及至有悟于理性，理智之必须
    分开。而后恍然罗素之三分法为不易之论。——
    罗素所云灵性相当于我所谓理性。（“中国文
    化要义”三四八页）这就是说，在二十七年前他还不懂得利用“理性”这一名词来骗人。二十七年来在马克思主义的普遍影响下，越来越多的群众认清了科学、民主、理性的重要，直觉主义越来越骗不了人，于是梁漱溟就篡夺了进步群众所相信的“理性”这一有号召力的名词，给它注入直觉主义的唯心主义的内容。梁漱溟所谓“理性”是一种心理的状态，是一种感情，而不是经过科学的分析，实践所证明的正确的认识。他说：
   “所谓理性者，要亦不外吾人平静通达底心理
    而已。”（“中国文化要义”，一三五页）又说：
    “知的一面曰理智；情的一方面曰理性”。（“中
    国文化要义”，一三八页）
    “不欺好恶而判别自然明切者是之谓理性。
      （“中国文化要义”，一四一页）
    “理性之取舍不一，而要以无私底感情为中
    心。（“中国文化要义”，一三八页）
    按照梁漱溟的说法，这种“无私底感情”“平静通达底心理”所产生的神秘的力量是无法估计的。它不仅是“人类的特征”，它还是“推动历史，支配社会，控制人生”的唯一力量。（“中国文化要义”，三四八页）
    梁漱溟用感情的直觉代替了理性的科学的分析。用主观的心理状态代替了判别是非的客观标准。用主观的直觉的好恶（喜欢或不喜欢）代替了检验真理的实践。他们说的“理性”实际上已变成“上帝”的代用品，因为只要凭借“无私的感情”“平静通达底心理”，居然能够“推动历史、支配社会，控制人生”，它不是不可思议的万能的上帝是什么？
    这一生命主义的反动传统，在清末汉奸头子曾国藩的手中也曾有所发挥。国民党匪帮的头子，蒋介石和陈立夫更进一步把这个反动传统同帝国主义的生命派哲学相结合，制造了反动透顶的“唯生论”。他们认为宇宙发展和社会发展都是由一种神秘的、不可抗的生之力量在推动着。世界的发展是盲目的冲动所造成的，没有任何规律，只要诚心诚意地信仰这种反动的哲学，就会产生出一种莫名其妙的蛮干的力量，就会产生他们所谓“革命”（应当说是反革命）的行动。这些法西斯的匪徒们认为只要盲目行动（他们所谓“力行”），就是实现了生命的原则，就是他们所谓“人生的意义”。法西斯匪徒们说“生命之意义在创造宇宙继起之生命”，他们把人和动物完全等同起来，说“人本是争生存的动物”，“生来就有一种向上的冲动”。这种原始的动物性的“争生存”“向上的冲动”被看做世界发展的动力。
    梁漱溟恰恰也唱着同样的调子。他说：“人的生活那里都是有意识的，他同动物一般也是出于本能，冲动”。（“东西文化及其哲学”一七○页）又说，“欲望”“冲动”是“人类行为的源泉”（“东西文化及其哲学”一七○页）“人类社会之进化，不外乎是沿着生物进化来底；二者同为宇宙大生命之表现，前者实为后者之继续。”（“中国文化要义”，四十三页）
    从以上的例证，我们不难看出，北宋的二程、王阳明、曾国藩、到蒋介石、陈立夫，这一系列的生命主义的哲学，都自己号称继承了中国文化。如果叫它做“中国文化”，那就是中国文化中最反动的封建性的糟粕，而这一反动的生命主义哲学的传统，恰恰也就是梁漱溟先生奉为至宝，尊为“中国文化”的“要义”的。
    梁漱溟的这些根本的观点，并不只是辞句上和蒋介石、陈立夫的“唯生”哲学的词句相同，而是精神实质上完全一致。胡适以他的实用主义为蒋介石和帝国主义服务，梁漱溟以他的生命主义哲学为蒋介石和帝国主义服务，这一点也是一样的。
