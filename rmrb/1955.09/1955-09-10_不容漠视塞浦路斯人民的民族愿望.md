The tripartite foreign ministers' conference of Britain, Turkey, and Greece, which discussed the political and military issues in the Eastern Mediterranean region, particularly Cyprus, began in London on August 29th. It was announced on September 7th that the conference would be suspended without achieving any results due to differences in opinion among the three governments. According to foreign news agencies, the purpose of Britain convening this conference was to find ways to continue maintaining its colonial rule over Cyprus. This situation has aroused strong opposition from the Cypriot people. The Cypriot people's struggle to get rid of British colonial rule and strive for freedom is intensifying.

This island, which occupies an extremely important position in the Eastern Mediterranean, was originally Greek territory. Greeks developed this island in the ninth century BC. Although it has long been under foreign rule, it has always maintained a distinct Greek national character. Among the 500,000 residents on the island, more than 80 percent – 400,000 people – are Greeks. The islanders still maintain Greek traditions, language, religious beliefs, and culture. The Cypriot people have never surrendered to foreign rule.

British colonialists took over this colony from the Ottoman Empire in 1878 and declared it a directly governed British colony in 1925. From the day the British colonialists forcibly occupied Cyprus, they transformed the island into an important military stronghold for the British Empire to expand into Mediterranean countries and the Middle East region, and to suppress the national liberation movements of the Middle Eastern countries. Under British colonial rule, the Cypriot people were in a state of economic plunder and political disenfranchisement. British monopoly capital turned Cyprus into an agricultural and raw material production base and a sales market for British goods dependent on the suzerain state. The lives of the Cypriot people were extremely impoverished. British official materials show that the average annual income of a farmer's family is only 70 pounds. Many people still live in caves. The British colonial authorities have adopted extremely cruel means of suppression against the Cypriot people's desire for freedom. The "Detention Law" enforced by Britain on the island stipulates that Cypriot youth who participate in a demonstration will be detained for six months; if students engage in patriotic activities, the school will be closed. British colonial authorities have repeatedly used armed force to suppress Cypriot patriots who hold strikes or demonstrations in various places, and even in remote villages, British colonial military police often conduct searches.

The Cypriot people have long been engaged in a heroic struggle to get rid of foreign colonial rule. The British "Times" once admitted that the Cypriot people's desire to get rid of British colonial rule is "as long as the British occupation period, or even longer." After World War II, the Cypriot people's struggle for national liberation was further developed, encouraged by the victory of the peace and democracy camp and the rise of the colonial people's struggle for independence. The Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus leads a national liberation united front that unites the island's patriotic and democratic forces extensively. Mass organizations such as the Cyprus Workers' Confederation, the Democratic Youth League, the Democratic Women's League, and the Farmers' Democratic Progressive Alliance constantly hold strikes and demonstrations to oppose colonial enslavement and demand unification with Greece. In January 1950, a plebiscite was held in Cyprus, and 96 percent of the 215,000 Greeks who participated in the vote agreed to unification with Greece. The large-scale demonstration held on August 2 this year to protest the "Detention Law" completely cut off transportation and telecommunications in various parts of the island. Greek and Turkish farmers on the island have repeatedly fought together to protest the British authorities' confiscation of land to build military bases. On August 29, the day the London conference opened, the people of Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, held a large demonstration demanding national self-determination. This increasingly high struggle of the Cypriot people to strive for freedom has aroused widespread attention and support from international public opinion.

The broad strata of Greece, including parties and groups with different political views, actively support the Cypriot people's demands to get rid of British colonial rule and to unify with Greece. The Greek people have demanded in various ways that the Greek government negotiate with Britain to satisfy the wishes of the Cypriot people. Under the influence of this unanimous demand of the Greek people, the Greek government has made several requests to the British government to hold negotiations on the Cyprus issue, and in April 1954, it sent a memorandum to London requesting a British response, but all were rejected by Britain. Due to the strong demands of the people, the Greek government filed an appeal at the Ninth United Nations General Assembly in 1954, demanding that the Cypriot people be given the right to national self-determination. This reasonable demand received strong support from representatives of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries at the General Assembly. However, due to the obstruction of colonial countries such as Britain and the United States, the majority of the United Nations Political Committee not only did not seriously consider the Greek proposal, but instead passed New Zealand's proposal advocating not to discuss the Cyprus issue.

Although the Greek government has made some efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue under the demands of the people, it has not taken a firm position to defend national interests on this issue. On the one hand, it advocates giving the Cypriot people the right to self-determination, so that the island will be unified with Greece, but on the other hand, it intends to make major concessions to the British colonialists, allowing Britain to maintain control over Cyprus. Greek Prime Minister Papagos has repeatedly stated that the Greek government is willing to allow Britain to maintain military bases in Cyprus and Greece. According to reports from foreign news agencies, Greek Foreign Minister Stefanopoulos also made the same "guarantee" to Britain at the London conference. This attitude of the Greek government is obviously inconsistent with the interests of Greek national sovereignty and security, as well as the Cypriot people's desire for freedom and independence.

Regardless of the Cypriot people's desire for self-determination, British colonialists stubbornly refuse to give up their colonial rule over Cyprus. The British government has repeatedly stated that it cannot transfer (Cyprus) sovereignty to Greece. British colonialists have repeatedly said that Cyprus is of strategic importance to the North Atlantic Group and is necessary for the "defense of the Arab world" in the Middle East, using this as an excuse to continue occupying this colony. At the same time, British colonialists are stepping up the requisition of large amounts of farmland in Cyprus to build military bases. Britain has also moved the British Army and Air Force headquarters in the Middle East to Cyprus, and the British troops withdrawn from the Suez Canal Zone under the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement are also concentrated here. The purpose of the British government convening the London conference is to use the "defense" of the North Atlantic Group as a cover to force Greece to agree to Britain's continued occupation of the island.

At the same time, British colonialists are constantly deceiving the Cypriot people with promises of so-called "constitution" and "autonomy" in Cyprus, as one of the means to maintain their colonial rule. However, this trick of the British colonialists is not new, and it cannot deceive the Cypriot people who are determined to fight for national self-determination. As early as 1882, Britain promulgated a "constitution" stipulating the establishment of a legislative council. In reality, it was an ornament of the British Governor's autocratic rule. When the Cypriot national self-determination movement rose in the early 1930s, even this decorative legislative council was dissolved. In 1948, Britain put forward a new draft "constitution," which was unanimously opposed by the Cypriot people. In July 1954, Britain announced that it would implement a "constitution" in Cyprus soon, and the Cypriot people's response to this trick was to hold large-scale protest demonstrations. They shouted: "We want to be united with Greece, not a constitution!" On August 11, 1954, thirteen mayors and one hundred and twenty city councilors of major towns in Cyprus unanimously passed a resolution rejecting any "constitution" granted to Cyprus by Britain. At this London conference, according to news from American news agencies, Britain put forward another so-called "constitution," vaguely listing the Cypriot people's self-determination as the "ultimate goal." Even Associated Press reporters said: "This new constitution will leave the status of Cyprus as a colony within the British Empire unchanged." On the same day that the British negotiators presented this "constitution" at the meeting, the British Admiralty spokesman announced the transfer of marines from Malta to Cyprus for "reinforcement." This nakedly exposes the colonialist face of Britain.

It should also be mentioned here that Turkey's attitude on the Cyprus issue. It advocates maintaining the status quo, actually supports the position of the British colonialists, and opposes granting the Cypriot people the right to self-determination. Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu, who attended the London conference, even said that if Greece wants to annex Cyprus, Turkey would demand that Cyprus be handed over to Turkey. Because of the serious disputes between Turkey and Greece at the London conference, this conference finally went from stalemate to failure without results. Turkey's participation in the competition for Cyprus has also deteriorated the relationship between Greece and Turkey.

It must be emphasized that the representatives of the Cypriot people were not invited to participate in the London conference. They will never recognize any decision made by a conference of this nature that undermines their right to national self-determination, and they will never allow imperialists to regard Cyprus as an object of contention. Today, colonialism has been universally condemned by the people of all countries. Only by satisfying the national aspirations of the Cypriot people and giving the Cypriot people the right to self-determination is it a reasonable way to resolve the Cyprus issue.

    不容漠视塞浦路斯人民的民族愿望
    梁田
    讨论东地中海地区、特别是塞浦路斯的政治和军事问题的英、土、希三国外长会议，于八月二十九日开始在伦敦举行，到九月七日，由于三国政府意见的分歧，便在没有取得任何结果的情况下宣布停止举行。据外国通讯社透露，英国召开这个会议的目的，是企图寻找方法来继续维持它对塞浦路斯的殖民统治。这种情形已引起塞浦路斯人民的强烈反对。塞浦路斯人民要求摆脱英国殖民统治和争取自由的斗争正日益高涨起来。
    这个在东地中海中占着极端重要位置的岛屿，原本是希腊的土地。希腊人在公元前九世纪时就开发了这个岛屿。虽然它长期处在外国的统治下，但是始终保持着鲜明的希腊民族特色。这个岛屿上五十万居民中，有百分之八十以上的人——四十万人是希腊人。岛上的居民至今保持着希腊传统、语言、宗教信仰和文化。塞浦路斯人民从未对外国的统治屈服过。
    英国殖民者于一八七八年从奥托曼帝国的手上接管了这块殖民地，并于一九二五年宣布它是英国的直辖殖民地。英国殖民者从强占了塞浦路斯的那一天起，便把这个岛屿变成为英帝国向地中海国家以及中东地区实行扩张和镇压中东各国人民争取民族解放运动的重要军事据点。在英国的殖民统治下，塞浦路斯人民处于经济上被掠夺和政治上无权的奴隶境地。英国垄断资本把塞浦路斯变成了附属于宗主国的农业和原料产地，英国商品的销售市场。塞浦路斯人民的生活极端贫困。英国官方材料表明，一个农民家庭平均一年收入只有七十英镑。很多人现在仍住在洞穴里。英国殖民当局对于塞浦路斯人民要求自由的愿望，采取了极为残酷的镇压手段。英国在岛上施行的“拘留法”就规定，塞浦路斯青年参加一次示威，要拘禁六个月；学生从事爱国活动，学校便要被封闭。英国殖民当局在各地以武装镇压举行罢工或示威的塞浦路斯爱国者，甚至在偏僻的乡村中也常有英国殖民军警进行搜索。
    塞浦路斯人民长期以来为摆脱外国的殖民统治而进行着英勇斗争。英国“泰晤士报”就曾承认，塞浦路斯人民要求摆脱英国殖民统治的愿望是“和英国占领时期一样长，实在说，还要更长些”。在第二次世界大战以后，塞浦路斯人民争取民族解放的斗争，受到和平民主阵营胜利和殖民地人民争取独立运动高涨的鼓舞，有了进一步的发展。塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党领导的民族解放统一阵线广泛地团结着岛上的爱国民主力量。塞浦路斯总工会、民主青年联盟、民主妇女联盟、农民民主进步联盟等群众组织，不断地举行罢工和示威，反对殖民奴役，要求归并希腊。一九五○年一月间塞浦路斯举行了一次公民投票，参加投票的二十一万五千希腊人中有百分之九十六赞成归并希腊。今年八月二日举行的抗议“拘留法”的大示威，使得岛上各地的交通和电讯完全断绝。岛上的希腊和土耳其农民多次共同进行斗争，抗议英国当局没收土地来建筑军事基地。就在八月二十九日，伦敦会议开幕的一天，塞浦路斯首府尼科西亚的人民还举行大示威，要求民族自决。塞浦路斯人民这种日益高涨的争取自由的斗争，引起了国际公众舆论的广泛注意和支持。
    希腊的广泛阶层，包括政治见解不同的党派和团体，都积极支持塞浦路斯人民摆脱英国殖民统治和归并希腊的要求。希腊人民曾以多种方式要求希腊政府同英国进行谈判，以满足塞浦路斯人民的愿望。在希腊人民这种一致的要求的影响下，希腊政府几次向英国政府要求，就塞浦路斯问题举行谈判，一九五四年四月并送交伦敦一件备忘录，要求英国答复，但是都遭到了英国的拒绝。由于人民的强烈要求，希腊政府才在一九五四年的第九届联合国大会上提出申诉，要求给予塞浦路斯人民以民族自决权利。这个合理的要求在大会上得到苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国代表的有力支持。但是由于英美等殖民国家的阻挠，联合国政治委员会的多数不但没有认真考虑希腊的提案，反而通过了主张不讨论塞浦路斯问题的新西兰的建议。
    希腊政府虽然在人民的要求下，为解决塞浦路斯问题作了一些努力，但是并没有在这个问题上采取坚定的保卫民族利益的立场。它一面主张给塞浦路斯人民的自决权，使这个岛屿归并于希腊，但另一方面它又打算向英国殖民者作出重大让步，容许英国保持对塞浦路斯的控制。希腊政府首相贝贝格斯曾一再表示，希腊政府愿意让英国在塞浦路斯和希腊保有军事基地。据外国通讯社的报道，希腊外交大臣斯特凡诺普洛斯在伦敦会议上，也向英国提出了同样的“保证”。希腊政府的这种态度同希腊民族主权和安全的利益以及塞浦路斯人民要求自由和独立的愿望，显然是不符合的。
    英国殖民者不顾塞浦路斯人民要求自决的愿望，顽固地不肯放弃它对塞浦路斯的殖民统治。英国政府曾一再表示，它不能把（塞浦路斯）主权交给希腊。英国殖民者一再说塞浦路斯对于北大西洋集团具有战略重要性，是中东“阿拉伯世界的防御”所必需，以此作为借口，继续霸占这块殖民地。英国殖民者同时加紧在塞浦路斯征用大批农田，修筑军事基地。英国并已把在中东的英国陆军和空军司令部移至塞浦路斯，根据英埃协定自苏彝士运河区撤退的英军也集中在这里。英国政府召开伦敦会议的目的便在于利用北大西洋集团的“防务”作为幌子，迫使希腊同意英国继续占领这个岛屿。
    同时，英国殖民者还不断以所谓在塞浦路斯实行“宪法”和“自治”的诺言，欺骗塞浦路斯人民，作为维持其殖民统治的手段之一。但是英国殖民者的这种手法，并不是新鲜的，它欺骗不了为争取民族自决而坚决斗争的塞浦路斯人民。早在一八八二年，英国就颁布过一个“宪法”，规定设立一个立法议会。实际上是英国总督独裁统治的装饰品，当本世纪三十年代初塞浦路斯民族自决运动高涨的时候，连这个点缀的立法议会也被解散了。一九四八年，英国提出过一个新“宪法”草案，结果遭到塞浦路斯人民的一致反对。一九五四年七月，英国宣布不久要在塞浦路斯实行“宪法”，塞浦路斯人民对于这种骗局的回答是举行大规模的抗议示威。他们高呼：“要归入希腊，不要宪法！”一九五四年八月十一日，塞浦路斯主要城镇的十三位市长和一百二十位市参议员一致作出决议，拒绝英国给予塞浦路斯的任何“宪法”。在这次伦敦会议上，据美国通讯社消息透露，英国又提出了一个所谓“宪法”，把塞浦路斯人民的自决空洞地列为“最后目标”。连美联社记者都说：“这个新宪法将原封不动地保持使塞浦路斯作为英帝国之内的一个殖民地的地位。”就在英国谈判代表在会上提出这个“宪法”的同一天，英国海军部发言人宣布从马耳他调海军陆战队到塞浦路斯去“增援”。这就更加赤裸地显露英国的殖民主义面貌。
    这里还应该提到土耳其在塞浦路斯问题上的态度。它主张维持现状，实际上支持了英国殖民者的立场，而反对给予塞浦路斯人民以自决权。出席伦敦会议的土耳其外长佐鲁甚至说，如果希腊要归并塞浦路斯，土耳其就要求把塞浦路斯交给土耳其。由于土耳其和希腊在伦敦会议上发生严重的争执，终于使得这一会议从僵局走向无结果而散。土耳其加入对塞浦路斯的争夺，使得希腊和土耳其的关系也为之恶化。
    必须着重指出的是：塞浦路斯人民的代表并没有被邀请参加伦敦会议，他们决不会承认这种性质的会议作出的任何损害他们民族自决权利的决定，也决不容许帝国主义者把塞浦路斯作为争夺的对象。今天，殖民主义已经遭到各国人民的普遍谴责。只有满足塞浦路斯人民的民族愿望，给塞浦路斯人民自决权，才是解决塞浦路斯问题的合理途径。
