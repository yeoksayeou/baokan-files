    Over the past year, research on winter wheat in North China has yielded results.

    Representatives from agricultural experiment and research institutions in the four provinces of North China gathered in Beijing from August 25th to September 2nd to summarize the achievements of winter wheat research in North China over the past year.

    The agricultural comprehensive experimental stations, agricultural science research institutes, and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces summarized the experience of farmers in planting winter wheat. Through various experiments, they identified many high-quality varieties that could be promoted and demonstrated. They also proposed better experiences and methods in terms of intensive planting, sowing date, tillage and moisture conservation, green manure application, and irrigation. Wheat pests and diseases were one of their research focuses, and they have already summarized the experience in preventing and controlling nematode diseases. Since some areas of North China are prone to waterlogging, which affects winter wheat yields, agricultural scientists established a "Research Base for Wheat Planting Technology in Drained Land (areas drained after waterlogging)" in Jinghai County, Hebei Province. They obtained a series of tillage techniques applicable to drained land, such as how to prevent seed rotting. After field experiments in agricultural production cooperatives at base points in Gaocheng, Hengshui, and Jinghai counties in Hebei Province, and Linyi and Hongzhao counties in Shanxi Province, it was proven that fully implementing these technologies could increase the yield of winter wheat by 80% compared to the local average.

    一年来华北冬小麦研究有成果
    华北四省农业试验研究机构的代表八月二十五日到九月二日在北京集会，总结了一年来研究华北冬小麦的成果。
    河北、河南、山西、山东四省农业综合试验站、农业科学研究所和华北农业科学研究所总结了农民种植冬小麦的经验，经过各种试验，确定了许多可以推广示范的优良品种。在密植、播种期、耕作保墒、压绿肥及灌溉等栽培技术方面也提出了较好的经验和办法。小麦病虫害是他们研究的重点之一，已经总结出线虫病的防治经验。由于华北部分地区容易发生内涝，影响冬小麦产量，农业科学工作者在河北省静海县设立了“脱水地（内涝地区的水排出以后）种麦技术研究基点”，得出了如何防止烂种等一系列适用于脱水地的耕作技术，经过在河北省藁城、衡水、静海，山西省临猗、洪赵等县的基点农业生产合作社的田间实验，证明全面贯彻这些技术后，可比当地一般冬小麦增产百分之八十。（新华社）
