    The Smolny in Leningrad was the headquarters where Lenin directed the armed uprising during the October Socialist Revolution, ushering in a new era for humanity. There is Lenin's room there. Anyone who enters this room cannot help but be moved by the simplicity of Lenin's life. This small room is partitioned by paneling. Behind the paneling are two single beds, which Lenin and Krupskaya used at the time, as well as a cabinet, a small table, and a small chaise lounge. In front of the paneling, one side has a round table and two chairs, and the other side has a small writing desk with a telephone, desk lamp, and ink bottle on it. Lenin lived in this simple room, like an ordinary worker's home, for four months. In March 1918, he moved to the Kremlin in Moscow. Lenin's rooms in the Kremlin were also characterized by simplicity. Apart from books and essential furniture, there was nothing luxurious or superfluous.

    The spirit of thrift advocated by Lenin and the Soviet Communist Party has not diminished in the thirty-odd years since the Soviet Union was built into a socialist society. On the contrary, it has become a pervasive atmosphere that can be felt everywhere in the Soviet Union. I have visited many factories, farms, organizations, and schools in the Soviet Union, and the offices of their staff are very simple. Ordinary tables, chairs, and portraits of Party and government leaders hanging on the walls - that's all there is. Many large factories produce huge amounts of wealth for the country every year, and the factory director's fund is also considerable, but the factory staff first considers the construction of production sites, and secondly the construction of cultural facilities for employees. Everyone knows that in the Soviet Union, grand commemorative events are not held unless it's a major anniversary. Meetings do not offer cigarettes or refreshments. People attending meetings can buy soda and snacks at nearby stalls during breaks, but at their own expense. People who have been to Europe and the United States have this feeling: Soviet people pay attention to nutrition in their diet, aesthetics in their clothing, and sturdiness in their belongings; life is good but not extravagant. They plan their personal spending very carefully, save surplus money in banks, and spend about half a month's income each year to buy construction bonds. In the ten years after the war, residents of Moscow alone used their savings of 17.743 billion rubles to purchase construction bonds.

    The Soviet Union builds thousands of new industrial enterprises every year, but in Moscow and other places, it does not abandon the use of old factory buildings built decades ago. The Soviet Union produces abundant industrial and agricultural products, but it does not abandon the utilization of waste. I visited the "Tenth Anniversary of the October Revolution" state-owned pig farm near Moscow. It collects discarded potato peels, vegetable roots, etc., from Moscow's hotels, cafeterias, and residents as feed, steams it, and feeds it to the pigs. It raises 17,000 to 18,000 pigs and needs more than 100 tons of dry feed every day, of which more than 70 percent is kitchen waste. This state-owned farm supplies the country with 3.5 million to 4 million kilograms of pork every year. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party in January this year that the food industry produces 25 million tons of residue and waste grain every year. If these waste materials are rationally utilized to raise livestock, at least 300,000 tons of meat can be obtained.

    The spirit of thrift in the Soviet Union is most profoundly infused into production. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to thrift in production. Because the funds for the Soviet Union's economic and cultural construction basically come from socialist enterprises, for example, in the 1955 budget, approximately 500 billion rubles, or 84 percent of the income, came from there. The more workers strive to reduce waste, save raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, and make full use of equipment, the more funds the country accumulates. These savings items, along with increased production, are included in each enterprise's production plan. An enterprise that only completes the output target in the plan but does not complete the variety and savings targets is not considered to have completed the production plan in the Soviet Union.

    The saving of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity is an aspect that Soviet industrial enterprises often pay attention to, because they constitute a large part of the cost of products. The workers of the Moscow "Electric Wire" factory carried out a competition to save materials, saving more than 5,000 tons of lead and 2,500 tons of copper last year. In the Moscow power plant, the fuel used to generate every 1,000 kilowatt-hours has been reduced from 502 kilograms to 462 kilograms in the past four or five years. In the first four months of this year, the raw materials and materials saved by Moscow textile and shoe factories were enough to produce an additional 280,000 meters of various textiles, 73,000 meters of knitted goods, and 247,000 pairs of leather shoes. Moscow industrial workers guarantee that this year they will save no less than 11,000 tons of metal, 250 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 65,000 tons of fuel, and will accumulate 175 million rubles beyond the plan.

    The potential for savings is infinite. Soviet people do not stay at the obvious savings that can be seen, such as reducing waste and cherishing raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity. They are now delving into more active savings: adopting and promoting advanced technologies and more economical designs. Since the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party issued the call to strive for technological progress, industrial and scientific workers throughout the Soviet Union have been exploring and excavating in this direction. For example, in the steel industry, the use of oxygen to strengthen the steelmaking process greatly increases the steel output rate, while reducing fuel consumption by 5 percent. The three steel joint factories of Zaporozhye, Kuznetsk, and Magnitogorsk alone, after fully utilizing oxygen in steelmaking, can produce an additional 1.5 million tons of steel per year from existing open-hearth furnaces, which is equivalent to the output of a modern large steel plant. Soviet scientific workers and workers of the "Russian Diesel Engine" factory have invented a method of smelting a kind of high-strength pig iron. This pig iron can replace steel in many situations. This factory used this pig iron to cast crankshafts. The Vladimir Tractor Manufacturing Plant produced 500 tractors with rear axles made of this pig iron. After the widespread adoption of this pig iron, 100,000 tons of steel can be saved every year. Three-quarters of the steel refined in the Soviet Union is rolled into steel. Rolling steel contains the possibility of saving a large amount of steel. According to research, rolling thin-walled wide-flange I-beams can save more than 20 percent of steel compared to rolling ordinary steel beams and has higher toughness. In the machinery manufacturing industry, more attention is now paid to reducing the weight of machines in the design to save steel and improve efficiency. The steel used in the "Stalin Worker-80" tractor was reduced by 30 percent in 1953 compared to 1949, and the steel used in all-metal passenger train carriages was reduced by 22 percent during the same period. The problem of reducing the weight of automobiles, tractors, and lathes continues to be studied. Wings, shafts, balls, wheels, gears, etc. on machines can save metal by using rolling methods rather than forging methods. The rear axle of the "Moskvich" car, which was originally forged, saved 20 to 24 percent of metal after being switched to rolling. The manufacture of complex machine parts, such as crankshafts, can save a lot of metal and labor by using casting methods instead of machining methods... On the basis of striving for technological progress, savings are expanding into an infinitely broad field.

    Saving is not a temporary movement in the Soviet Union, but a long-term, persistent system. Any wasteful ideas and phenomena that violate the saving system will be criticized; any saving ideas and suggestions that are beneficial to the accumulation of socialist funds will be supported. The principle of accumulating small amounts to make a large amount is an important content of the Soviet Union's propaganda on saving ideas. In many factories, slogans calling for cherishing every screw and saving every kopek can be seen. Because empty talk about saving is of no help, saving must start from small things. One percent is a very small number, but this year the Soviet Union's national industrial products can save more than 6 billion rubles if the cost is reduced by one percent. Soviet workers are working hard for this matter.

    Streamlining institutions to reduce non-productive administrative expenses and improve work efficiency is an effective saving method in the Soviet Union. At the beginning of this year, various departments of the Soviet government streamlined their staffing, eliminated redundant links, and reduced administrative management agencies. This measure allowed many experienced staff to directly participate in production, not only saving expenses but also bringing great benefits to the work of institutions and the production of enterprises. At the beginning of this year, 200 administrative bureaus and independent sections, 147 trusts, 898 supply agencies, and 4,500 retail offices were eliminated in only 46 ministries of the Soviet government. After the All-Soviet Industrial Workers Conference, many factories carried out streamlining. The Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant merged many sections, reduced 342 people from the administrative management agencies, and sent them to directly participate in production, which saved the factory nearly 5 million rubles per year.

    In the Soviet Union, often the upper floors of buildings are still under construction, while the lower floors are already occupied; some factories have not been fully completed, while some workshops have already been put into production; hydroelectric power stations are even more gradually installing machines and gradually generating electricity. These are all active savings. Saving, like ensuring quality, is the goal of the struggle on the vast construction front in the Soviet Union. People know that the All-Soviet Construction Workers Conference held last December severely criticized certain shortcomings such as decentralized use of funds, construction without design, excessive pursuit of external decoration without regard to economic practicality, and not cherishing steel materials. These shortcomings are being overcome. Reinforced concrete components are being used to replace steel beams and steel frames. The design of buildings is more economical and practical.

    Soviet experience proves that the saving system can only be guaranteed and progressed in the continuous struggle against wasteful ideas.

    After nearly forty years of hard work, the Soviet people today live an enviable and beautiful life. As the masters of the country, the Soviet people can be said to be the richest people in the world. From 1930 to 1953, the national income of the United States increased by only 1.3 times, while the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 7 times. In capitalist countries, most of the national income is swallowed up by parasitic classes such as capitalists and landlords. In the Soviet Union, the national income all belongs to the working people and is used to meet the needs of the workers and expand socialist production. The Soviet people are rich and frugal, do not excessively demand consumer goods, and continue to strengthen the production of means of production. This is precisely because under the guidance of the Soviet Communist Party, they know how to subordinate immediate interests to long-term interests and strive to realize the highest ideal of building a communist society. Before the war, in order to build a socialist society, during the war, in order to defeat the fascists, after the war, in order to restore and develop the national economy, and today, in order to build a communist society, the Soviet people have consistently maintained a frugal style in their lives, so that more national income can be invested in the cause of expanding socialist production.

    苏联人民的节约精神
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    列宁格勒的斯莫尔尼，是十月社会主义革命时候列宁指挥武装起义、开辟人类新纪元的司令部。那里有列宁住过的房间。进到这个房间的人，不能不为列宁生活的朴素所感动。这个小房间用壁板隔开。板后分放着两张单人床，那是列宁和克鲁普斯卡雅当时用的，还有柜、几、小卧椅各一个。板前一边放着圆桌，两把椅子，另一边放着小写字台，台上搁着电话、桌灯和墨水瓶。列宁在这个像普通工人住家一样简单的房间住了四个月。他在一九一八年三月间移居到莫斯科的克里姆林宫。克里姆林宫内列宁居住过的房间也充满着简朴的色彩。那里除了书籍和必需的家具以外，没有什么奢华的、多余的东西。
    列宁和苏联共产党所倡导的节约精神，三十多年来没有因为苏联已经建成社会主义社会而懈怠，相反的，它成为在苏联随处感触得到的风气了。我到过苏联许多工厂、农庄、机关、学校，那里工作人员的办公室都是很朴素的。普通的桌子、椅子和墙壁上挂的党政领导者的像，——这就是一切。许多大工厂每年替国家生产巨额的财富，厂长基金也不少，但是工厂工作人员首先盘算的是生产场所的建设，其次是职工文化机关的建设。大家都知道，在苏联不逢五逢十是不兴举行什么盛大纪念会的。开会不招待香烟茶点。参加开会的人在休息时候可以在附近的小卖处喝汽水吃点心，但是自费。到过欧美的人们有这样的感觉：苏联人民饮食讲究营养，穿着讲究美观，用物喜欢结实的；生活美好但不奢侈。他们个人的花钱很有计划，有余钱，储蓄在银行里，每年拿半个月左右的收入购买建设公债。战后十年中仅仅莫斯科一个市的居民就用自己节约的资金一百七十七亿四千三百万卢布购买了建设公债。
    苏联每年建造数以千计的新的工业企业，但在莫斯科和其他各地不放弃对几十年前的旧厂房的利用。苏联生产丰富的工农业产品，但不放弃对废物的利用。我参观过莫斯科附近的“十月革命十周年”国营养猪农场。它收集莫斯科的饭店、食堂和居民废弃的洋芋皮、蔬菜根等等当饲料，蒸好喂猪。它养一万七、八千头猪，每天需要一百吨干饲料，其中百分之七十以上是利用厨房废物。这个国营农场每年供给国家三百五十万到四百万公斤猪肉。赫鲁晓夫同志在今年一月苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的报告中指出过：食品工业每年出产二千五百万吨残渣和废谷。如果合理地利用这些废料来饲养牲畜，至少可以得到三十万吨肉类。
    苏联的节约精神最深刻地贯注在生产当中。苏联最重视生产中的节约。因为苏联经济和文化建设的资金基本上是从社会主义的企业来的，例如一九五五年预算中约五千亿卢布，即收入的百分之八十四，是从那里来的。劳动者越努力减少废品，节约原料、材料、燃料、电力，充分利用设备，国家积累的资金也越多。这些节约的项目和提高产量一起列入每个企业的生产计划中。一个企业如果单只完成计划中产量的指标，而没有完成品种和节约的指标，在苏联就不算完成生产计划。
    原料、材料、燃料、电力的节约，是苏联工业企业经常注意的方面，因为它们是产品成本构成的大部分。莫斯科“电线”工厂职工进行了节约材料的竞赛，在去年节约了五千多吨铅、二千五百多吨铜。莫斯科发电厂四、五年来发电每一千瓩时所用燃料从五百零二公斤减低到四百六十二公斤。在今年头四个月中，莫斯科纺织厂和皮鞋厂节约的原料和材料，足够额外制造二十八万公尺各种纺织品，七万三千公尺针织品，二十四万七千双皮鞋。莫斯科工业工作人员保证在今年将节约不下一万一千吨金属、二亿五千万瓩时电力、六万五千吨燃料，将超计划积累一亿七千五百万卢布。
    节约的潜在可能性是无穷的。苏联人不停留在眼见得到的明显的节约上面，如像减少废品，爱惜原料、材料、燃料、电力。他们现在深入到更加积极的节约方面：采用和推广先进的技术和更加经济的设计。自从苏共中央提出争取技术进步的号召以来，全苏联工业和科学工作人员都向这方面探讨和发掘。例如：在钢铁工业中，用氧加强炼钢过程，大大提高出钢率，同时减少百分之五的燃料消耗量。仅仅萨坡罗什、库兹涅茨克、马格尼托哥尔斯克三个钢铁联合工厂，在充分使用氧炼钢以后，可以由现有的平炉每年多产一百五十万吨钢，这等于一座现代化的大钢铁厂的产量。苏联科学工作人员和“俄罗斯柴油机”工厂职工发明了冶炼一种高坚的生铁的办法。这种生铁可以在许多场合代替钢材。这个工厂用这种生铁铸造了曲柄。弗拉基米尔拖拉机制造厂出产了五百辆拖拉机，它们的后桥就是用这种生铁造的。在广泛地采用这种生铁以后，每年可以节约十万吨钢材。苏联炼的钢四分之三轧成钢材。在轧钢中含蓄着节约大量钢的可能性。据研究，轧薄壁宽条工字形钢梁，比轧平常的钢梁可以节约百分之二十以上的钢并且韧度更高。在机器制造业中，现在更加注意在设计时候减轻机器的重量，以节约钢铁和提高效能。“斯大林工作者—八十”式拖拉机所用的钢材在一九五三年比一九四九年减少了百分之三十，全部金属制的旅客火车厢所用的钢材同期减少百分之二十二。汽车、拖拉机、车床的重量减低问题被继续研究着。机器上的翼、轴、滚珠、轮子、齿轮等等，用轧压方法比锻压方法能够节约金属。“莫斯科人”汽车的后轴，原来是锻压的，转用轧压后，节约百分之二十到二十四的金属。复杂的机器零件，如像曲轴的制造，用铸造方法代替机械加工方法，可以节约大量金属和劳动量……在争取技术进步的基础上，节约向无限广阔的境域开展着。
    节约在苏联不是一时一刻的运动，而是长期的坚持不懈的制度。任何违反节约制度的浪费思想和现象都要受到批判；任何有益于社会主义资金积累的节约思想和建议都会受到支持。积少成多的道理，是苏联宣传节约思想的重要内容。在许多工厂都可以见到号召爱惜每一个螺丝钉、节约每一个戈比的标语。因为空谈节约是无补于事的，节约要从一点一滴做起。百分之一是极小的数目，但是今年苏联全国工业产品每降低成本百分之一，就能节约六十多亿卢布。苏联劳动者都为这件事而努力着。
    精简机构，以缩减非生产的行政开支和提高工作效率，这在苏联是行之有效的节约方法。今年年初苏联政府各个部门精简了编制，取消了多余的环节，缩小了行政管理机构。这个措施使许多有经验的工作人员直接参加到生产中去，不但节约开支，而且给机关工作和企业生产带来很大益处。今年年初仅在苏联政府的四十六个部中就取消了二百个管理局和独立科室、一百四十七个托辣斯、八百九十八个供应机关、四千五百个零售事务所。在全苏工业工作人员会议以后，许多工厂进行了精简。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂合并了许多科室，从行政管理机构缩减了三百四十二人，派他们直接参加生产，这使工厂每年节约将近五百万卢布。
    在苏联，常常有些楼房的上层还在建筑，而下层已经住进人家；有些工厂的建设还没有全部完工，而某些车间已经投入生产；水电站更是逐步安装机器，逐步发电。这都是积极性的节约。节约，正如保证质量，是苏联广大的建筑阵线上斗争的目标。人们都知道，去年十二月举行的全苏建筑工作人员会议，严厉批评了某些分散使用资金，没有设计就施工，过分追求外表装饰而不顾经济实用，不爱惜钢铁材料等等缺点。这些缺点正被克服着。钢筋混凝土构件被用来代替钢梁钢架了。建筑物的设计更加讲求经济和实用了。
    苏联的经验证明：节约制度只有在同浪费思想不断斗争中才能得到保障和进步。
    苏联人民经过将近四十年勤劳建设，今天过着令人羡慕的美好生活。作为国家主人的苏联人民，可以说是世界上最富的人民。从一九三○年到一九五三年，美国国民收入只增长一点三倍，而苏联国民收入增长七倍。在资本主义国家，国民收入的大部分被资本家地主等寄生阶级所吞占。在苏联，国民收入全部是属于劳动人民的，是用来满足劳动者的需要和扩大社会主义生产的。苏联人民富裕而节俭，不过分要求消费品而继续加强生产资料的生产。这正是因为他们在苏联共产党的教导之下，知道把眼前利益服从长远利益，为实现建设共产主义社会的最高理想而努力。在战前为了建成社会主义社会，在战时为了战胜法西斯主义者，在战后为了恢复和发展国民经济，在今天为着建设共产主义社会，苏联人民在生活上一贯保持着节俭的作风，使更多的国民收入投入到扩大社会主义生产的事业中去。
