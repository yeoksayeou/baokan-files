Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 16th: In the Lhasa plain and the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, the highland barley and wheat have long, full ears, and the harvest is comparable to the bumper harvest of 1953. In recent days, farmers in various dzongs and manors have held the "Ongkor" festival, a tradition passed down from the time of the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo of the Tang Dynasty, to celebrate the expected harvest. During the festival, young and middle-aged farmers dressed as ancient knights rode horses to inspect the abundant crops. The field owners treated them with highland barley wine, and men and women farmers congratulated each other on the auspicious harvest. Afterwards, a horse race and archery contest were held. After the celebration, farmers everywhere are preparing the grounds and building sheds to prepare for the harvest.

    The banks of the Nyang Chu River, which suffered floods in 1954, also show a scene of abundant harvest. Where the water flooded in 1954, the crops are now golden, and in some places the highland barley has grown to four feet high, with fat ears, which is a rare good harvest in the past ten years.

    The Shannan and Qamdo regions also have good harvests this year. Before the autumn harvest, the Qamdo branch of the state-owned trading company supplied farmers with more than 10,000 sickles. This year, some farmers in the Qamdo region will use the iron farm tools distributed by the state free of charge for the first time for harvesting.

    In the warm areas of Yadong in the valleys of the Himalayas, Bomi in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the valleys of the middle and lower reaches of the Nujiang River, various crops have already been harvested. Farmers in the Bomi area have planted late autumn crops such as buckwheat. In the Tabo area bordering Bomi, highland barley and wheat have also matured. According to local farmers, grain crops will increase by 20% compared to 1954. Rapeseed is also growing better than in 1954. Currently, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in the area are helping the Tibetans harvest.

    This year marks the fifth year of abundant harvest in most agricultural areas of the Kangzang Plateau since liberation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 16th: The Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station is harvesting. Before and during the harvest, the farm has received more than 400 people from all walks of life in Tibet who came to visit. The visitors unanimously praised the new achievements made by the farm and expressed their willingness to learn the advanced farming methods of the farm.

    On September 11, Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, accompanied the Dalai Lama's tutor, Lingcang Living Buddha, and Deputy Tutor, Chijiang Living Buddha, Jigao Kanbu Losang Sandan, Kalon So Kang Wangqing Gellei and Apo Awang Jinmei of the Tibetan Local Government, and Wangde, representative of the Panchen Kanbu Conference Hall Committee in Lhasa, and more than 50 monks and lay officials, visited the Agricultural Experiment Station. During the visit, the officials were extremely interested in the tea saplings that sprouted for the first time this year, the mature watermelons, the dozens of varieties of high-quality spring wheat, and the successfully trial-planted flax. While visiting, they talked and said: The achievements of the Agricultural Experiment Station show that many kinds of crops can also be grown on the plateau, and agricultural production in the Tibet region will have a good development prospect.

    A group of farmers who visited the farm on the 9th also held a forum with the farm staff. They asked the farm staff about the fertilization, irrigation, and seedling raising methods of grain and vegetable crops. Some farmers requested the farm to send them some of the successfully propagated high-quality spring wheat as seeds, which is about two to three times higher in yield than the local general spring wheat.

    康藏高原大部农业区青稞和小麦丰收
    新华社拉萨十六日电  在拉萨平原和雅鲁藏布江中游，青稞和小麦穗长粒满，年景和大丰收的一九五三年相当。这几天，各宗各溪卡的农民，已按着唐代藏王松赞干布时留传下来的风俗，分别举行了预祝丰收的“望果”节。节日里，扮成古代骑士的青、壮年农民，骑马巡视了丰硕的庄稼，田主人用青稞酒款待了他们，男女农民跟着互相祝贺丰收吉祥，随后举行了赛马比箭大会。各地农民结束了庆祝活动以后，都在作场地、搭棚架，准备开镰收割。
    在一九五四年遭受水灾的年楚河两岸，也呈显出一片丰收景象，一九五四年被水淹过的地方，现在庄稼一片金黄，有些地方的青稞长到四尺高，穗子肥大，是十年来少有的好收成。
    山南区和昌都地区今年也都是上好年景。国营贸易公司昌都分公司已在秋收前供应给农民镰刀一万多把，今年昌都地区的部分农民，将第一次用国家无偿发放的铁质农具进行收获。
    在喜马拉雅山山谷中的亚东、雅鲁藏布江下游的波密、怒江中下游河谷等温暖地区，各种作物已经收割完毕。波密地区的农民已种下荞麦等晚秋作物。和波密接壤的塔博地区，青稞、小麦也已成熟，据当地农民观察，麦类作物将比一九五四年增产两成。油菜也比一九五四年长得好。目前驻当地的中国人民解放军和工作人员，正在帮助藏民收获。
    康藏高原大部农业区今年获得解放后的第五个丰收年。
    新华社拉萨十六日电  拉萨农业试验场正在进行收获。农场在收获以前和收获期间，已接待了四百多位前来参观的藏族各界人士。参观的人一致赞扬农场获得的新成就，并表示要学习农场的先进农作方法。
    九月十一日，中共西藏工作委员会副书记范明等陪同达赖喇嘛的经师林仓活佛和副经师赤江活佛，机巧堪布洛桑三旦，西藏地方政府噶伦索康·旺清格来、阿沛·阿旺晋美以及班禅堪布会议厅委员会驻拉萨代表旺德等五十多名僧俗官员，参观了农业试验场。参观时，官员们对今年第一次生出嫩叶的茶树幼苗，成熟了的大西瓜，几十种品种的良种春小麦，试种成功的亚麻，都感到极大的兴趣。他们一边参观一边谈论着说：农业试验场的成就，说明高原上也可以生长很多种庄稼，西藏地区的农业生产将有很好的发展前途。
    九日来农场参观的一批农民，还和农场工作人员进行了座谈，他们询问了农场工作人员关于粮食、蔬菜作物的施肥、灌溉和育苗方法。有的农民约请农场把繁殖成功的良种春小麦送给他们一些作种子，这种小麦大约比当地一般春小麦的产量高两倍到三倍。
