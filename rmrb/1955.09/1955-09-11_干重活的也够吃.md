　　The Yisheng Iron Factory, a private iron factory in Beijing, is a small factory where all thirteen young and middle-aged workers eat their meals. Since the factory implemented a system of verified grain supply in June, they have been saving more and more grain each month. Based on the actual amount of grain consumed per person, they saved 2 jin and 10 liang per person in July compared to June, and after trying out fixed-quantity grain supply per person in August, they saved another 2 jin and 12 liang per person compared to July. August was the month with the least grain consumption in the factory, yet each person still consumed 46 and a half jin, exceeding the standard by 1 and a half jin. This was only because there was leftover grain from July, and in August, six night shift workers ate one less meal per day, buying cooked food outside, so they had a surplus of grain to allocate to other units.

　　Starting in September, the leftover grain from the previous month will be gone. Will there be enough to eat? To answer this question, Zhao Minglun, the worker in charge of the food account, and Zhao Jinchuan and Dong Guanglin, the worker representatives of the mess hall, made a more detailed study based on the experience of saving grain since June. After the study, they unanimously agreed that the supply standard of 45 jin per person per month was sufficient. The problem was that the factory's planning and arrangement of grain had to be improved. They felt it was necessary to hold a meeting with the workers to discuss ways to save grain in September.

　　On August 31, the workers officially held a meeting to discuss the matter. Zhao Minglun began by saying, "The state's implementation of a fixed-quantity supply per person requires us to live more planned lives and save more grain for the country. However, our work in saving grain in August was not very good. Everyone should carefully study whether there are still areas for saving." He carefully reported the grain consumption situation over the past few months to everyone, explaining that although the amount of grain consumed decreased month by month, there were still areas where arrangements were not well done, so on average, each person still exceeded the standard by more than one jin.

　　After understanding the actual situation, everyone felt that it was necessary to continue to improve the management of the mess hall and to arrange life more planned. Worker Ma Zhijin said, "Before June, we had to buy 50 jin of grain per person each month. At that time, the food expenses exceeded every month. Now, with the mess hall management, we eat less grain, and the food has improved a lot. If we can find ways to improve in the future, the food can be further improved, and more grain can be saved." He connected the importance of a factory planning its life with the benefits of the grain supply method based on fixed quantities per person. He said, "After the fixed quantity per person, everyone can arrange their lives well, and the country can also control grain more planned and arrange the lives of the people across the country." Technician Jiang Yuwen, when he mentioned the present life, he remembered the bitter life before liberation. He said, "Think about when I was an apprentice before liberation, I got up at six in the morning to work, and I didn't eat a cornbread bun until noon. I worked until midnight, and I still ate cornbread buns. Sometimes I was so sleepy that I dozed off, and I would be slapped and kicked. At that time, the capitalists ate meat and wine and white flour; we workers only had white flour to eat during the New Year. Now? Every day is white flour and rice. In order to save more grain for the country, I strongly support the government's method of supplying fixed quantities per person. With this method, bad people cannot exploit loopholes, and everyone has enough grain to eat." His words reminded everyone of the miserable life before liberation, and they felt that the present was incomparable to the time before liberation, completely two different worlds. Worker Su Huaiyuan said, "Since the government implemented a planned supply of flour, we have never been without white flour steamed buns. Before the implementation of verified grain supply, we often wasted leftover steamed buns. After the verified supply, although we no longer wasted grain casually, we were not meticulous in our calculations. Now, with fixed quantities per person, life can be arranged better, and we can save more grain for the country." He also said, "When the fixed-quantity-per-person method began to be tried out here, I felt that our factory was small, with no loopholes, and there was not much to save. Now I realize that grain is related to the lives of the people across the country and to the completion of the country's Five-Year Plan. If the country can arrange grain well, unscrupulous merchants cannot speculate, and bad people cannot exploit loopholes. I think the fixed-quantity supply per person is the best method."

　　Everyone proposed ways to improve the management of the mess hall and made detailed calculations. The results of the calculation showed that various measures could be taken in September to save more than 50 jin of grain. According to this amount, each person only needs more than 43 jin of grain, which is more than one jin lower than the supply standard. Everyone said that this was completely achievable.

　　Finally, everyone unanimously asked the cook, Li Jinjie, to use his brain more, increase the variety of food, and ensure good nutrition so that the workers would love to eat it. Li Jinjie said with confidence: "I guarantee that there will be enough grain to eat, and I guarantee that everyone will eat well." The workers smiled contentedly.

　　Through this meeting, everyone realized that the fixed-quantity standard is enough even for workers doing heavy labor. As long as you are meticulous and arrange your life well, it is possible to save more grain. According to the new plan, they can still eat three meals of dry food every day, and everyone is preparing to use the money saved to improve non-staple food.

    干重活的也够吃
    葛娴
    北京私营义胜铁工厂是一家小型铁工厂，全厂十三个青壮年工人，都在厂里吃饭。这个厂从六月份开始实行粮食核实供应以后，一月比一月节约。按照每人实际吃粮数，七月份每人比六月份节约了二斤十两，八月份试行按人定量供应以后，每人又比七月份节约了二斤十二两。八月份是这个厂吃粮最少的一个月，可是每人还吃了四十六斤半，超过标准一斤半。只是因为七月份有余粮，八月份又有六个夜班工人每天少吃一顿，在外边买熟食吃，所以剩出了一部分粮食调剂给了别的单位。
    从九月份开始，上月份的存粮是不会有了，够不够吃呢？为了解答这一问题，厂内管伙食账的工人赵明伦和伙食团的工人代表赵金川、董广林等人根据六月份以来节约粮食的经验作了更详细的研究，研究以后一致认为，按照每人每月四十五斤的供应标准是足够的，问题是厂里对粮食的计划安排工作必须改进。他们感到有必要同工人开一个会，研究一下九月份节约粮食的办法。
    八月三十一日，工人正式开会讨论。赵明伦首先说：“国家试行按人定量供应的办法是要求咱们更有计划地过日子，更多地为国家节约粮食。可是咱们八月份节约粮食的工作做得还不算很好，大家应该好好研究一下是不是还有可节约的地方？”他把几个月来吃粮的情况仔细报告给大家听，说明吃粮数量虽然逐月下降，但还有安排不好的地方，所以平均每人还超过标准一斤多。
    大家明了了实际情况以后，就感到必须继续改进伙食团的管理，要更有计划地安排生活。工人马志晋说：“咱们在六月份以前，每人哪月也要买五十斤粮食，那时伙食费月月超过，现在有了伙食团管理，粮食少吃了，伙食反而改善多了，以后咱们再想办法改进，伙食还可改善，还能节约出粮食来。”他从一个厂有计划安排生活的重要，联想到粮食按人定量供应办法的好处。他说：“按人定量以后，各人可以自己安排好生活，国家也可以更有计划地控制粮食，安排好全国人民的生活。”技工姜玉温，提起现在的生活，他就想起解放以前的苦生活来。他说：“想想我在解放以前当学徒时，早上六点起来干活，到晌午才吃上一顿窝窝头，一干干到半夜，还是吃的窝窝头。有时候困得慌，就打盹，一打盹就挨巴掌，挨脚踢。那时资本家吃的是酒肉和白面；咱们当工人的，除非过年过节时才有顿白面吃。现在呢？天天是白面大米。为了给国家多节约点粮食，我非常拥护政府按人定量供应的办法，实行这办法，坏人不能钻空子，人人都有足够粮食吃。”他的话使大家想起了解放以前的悲惨生活，觉得现在同解放以前根本不能相比，完全是两个世界。工人苏怀元说：“自从政府对面粉实行计划供应以来，咱们白面馒头从没断过。没实行粮食核实供应以前，咱们常常糟踏吃剩的馒头，核实供应以后，虽然不随便浪费粮食了，可是总没精打细算。现在按人定量，生活就可以安排得更好一些，也就可以更多给国家节约些粮食了。”他又说：“按人定量办法开始在咱们这里试行时，我觉得咱们厂小，没啥漏洞，也没多少可以节约的。现在我认识到粮食关系着全国人民的生活，关系到国家五年计划的完成，国家能把粮食安排好了，奸商就不能投机，坏人也不能钻空子。我看按人定量供应是最好的办法。”
    大家纷纷提出了改进伙食管理的办法，同时作了详细的计算。计算的结果，九月份采取各种办法，还可以节约粮食五十多斤。按这个量，每人只要四十三斤多粮食就够了，比供应标准低一斤多。大家都说这完全可以作到。
    最后大家一致要求炊事员李晋阶多开动脑筋，增加饭菜的花样，保证营养好，叫工人都爱吃。李晋阶很有信心地说：“保证粮食够吃，保证大家吃好。”工人们都满意地笑了。
    通过这次会，大家认识到：干重活的工人按定量标准也是够吃的。只要精打细算，把生活安排好了，节约出更多的粮食是可能的。按照新的计划，他们每天仍然可以吃三顿干饭，大家准备把节约下来的钱用来改善副食。
