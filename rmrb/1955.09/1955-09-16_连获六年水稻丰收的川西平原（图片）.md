The Chengdu Plain in Western Sichuan Achieves Sixth Consecutive Year of Bumper Rice Harvest

Sichuan Province, a major rice-producing area in China, has achieved another bumper harvest this year on its more than 50 million mu of medium-season rice. This marks the sixth consecutive year of bumper rice harvests for Sichuan Province. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, Sichuan farmers have actively carried out agricultural production increase and mutual aid and cooperation movements, increasing the production of large quantities of grain to support the country's socialist construction.

In the famous Dujiangyan irrigation area of the Chengdu Plain, the main canals of the water system have been lengthened this year, and new projects such as the Sanheyan have been built, expanding the Dujiangyan irrigation area from 3.2 million mu last year to more than 4 million mu. The Chengdu Plain is now filled with a joyous atmosphere of harvest. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Zhongjing photographed.

Thanks to the Dujiangyan irrigation project, the fertile Chengdu Plain has seen sufficient irrigation for its rice paddies, resulting in six consecutive years of bumper harvests. This is the Xiejiang aqueduct in the newly built Sanheyan irrigation project of Dujiangyan this year.

Members of the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anren Township, Dayi County, are bagging the dried and cleaned grain, ready to sell it to the state.

Having achieved its sixth consecutive year of bumper rice harvests, many agricultural production cooperatives in the Chengdu Plain have exceeded this year's rice production increase targets. This is a scene of members of the Minbai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taiping Township, Xinjin County, drying and cleaning the abundant rice harvest, ready to distribute it to the members and sell it to the state.
