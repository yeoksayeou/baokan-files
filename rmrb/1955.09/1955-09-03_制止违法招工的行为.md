Stop Illegal Recruitment

To the Editor:

The construction site of the Beijing Municipal Social Welfare Bureau's Eastern Suburb Jiaochang Workers Training Class started on July 14th this year. They did not apply to the labor department for labor allocation as required, but instead privately recruited 71 workers. The vast majority of these people were farmers who blindly flowed into the city, including 16 who did not have official household registration in Beijing. The Labor Section of the Eastern Suburb People's Committee notified them at the time to immediately stop this illegal recruitment, but it did not receive due attention. On July 20th, they recruited 14 workers through personal connections. Then, in the form of "large-scale contracting," they had a temporary worker, Xu Zengrong, recruit a group of people from his hometown, Dawangzhuang Township, Yongqing County, Hebei Province. This included 11 members of agricultural production cooperatives (some were even the head or accountant) and 5 members of mutual aid teams. After these people came to Beijing, they were unable to apply for grain rations because they did not have household registration, so they bought cooked food in the Dongzhimen and Chaoyangmen areas every day (up to sixty or seventy jin per day). I believe that this behavior not only violates the state's labor force allocation policy and the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Persuading Farmers to Stop Blindly Flowing into Cities," and directly harms the development of agricultural production and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, but also undermines the policy of planned grain supply. I suggest that the relevant leading organs seriously handle this issue.

    制止违法招工的行为编辑同志：
    北京市社会福利局东郊教场职工训练班工地在今年七月十四日开工。他们不按规定向劳动部门申请调配劳动力，却私自招收了七十一名工人。这些人绝大部分是盲目流入城市的农民，其中有十六名在北京没有正式户口。东郊区人民委员会劳动科当时通知他们立即制止这种违法招工的行为，但是并没有引起应有的重视。他们在七月二十日通过私人关系招收了十四名工人；接着又以“大包工”的形式，让临时工徐增荣到原籍河北省永清县大王庄乡招来一批人，其中有农业生产合作社社员（有的还是社长或会计）十一名，互助组员五名。这些人到北京后，因为没有户口，无法申请供应粮食，就每天拿着面袋在东直门、朝阳门一带购买熟食（每天多达六、七十斤）。我认为这种行为不仅违犯了国家的劳动力调配政策和政务院“关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示”，直接损害了农业生产和农业互助合作事业的发展，而且还破坏了粮食计划供应政策。建议有关领导机关对这个问题进行严肃的处理。	北京市东郊区人民委员会  魏联友
