    The Palace Museum Has Been Open for Thirty Years
    The Palace Museum has been open for thirty years now.
    The Palace Museum is China's largest art museum. The Hall of Supreme Harmony and the East and West Palaces are comprehensive exhibition halls of Chinese art throughout the ages. Here, visitors can see the brilliant ancient art of China over the past four thousand years. People can also go to various exhibition halls to appreciate specialized art according to their own interests. The Painting Gallery is located in the Hall of Imperial Supremacy and the Palace of Tranquil Longevity. On display here are masterpieces of painting from the Sui, Tang to the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Palace of Compassion and Tranquility is the Ceramics Gallery. Here, one can study the four-thousand-year history of the development of one of China's great inventions – ceramic technology. The east and west wings of the Palace of Heavenly Purity are the "International Friendship Museum," which newly opened in May of this year. The museum displays more than 2,300 precious gifts from more than forty countries.
    During the rule of the reactionary regime, the Palace Museum was never repaired. After liberation, more than 180,000 cubic meters of garbage alone were cleared. There are large-scale protective repairs every year.
    More and more people are visiting the museum. The total number of visitors in 1953 and 1954 was nearly three million, far exceeding the total number of visitors in the twenty-four years before liberation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    故宫博物院已开放三十年
    故宫博物院开放到现在已有三十年了。
    故宫是中国最大的艺术博物院。太和殿和东、西宫是中国历代艺术综合陈列馆。观众在这里可以看到中国四千年来光辉灿烂的古代艺术。人们还可以依照自己的兴趣到各类陈列馆欣赏专门的艺术。绘画馆设在皇极殿和宁寿宫中。这里陈列的是隋、唐以至明、清的历代绘画杰作。慈宁宫是陶瓷馆。这里可以研究我国伟大发明之一——陶瓷工艺四千年来的发展史。乾清宫两庑是今年五月新开放的“国际友谊馆”。馆内陈列着来自四十多个国家的二千三百多件珍贵礼品。
    在反动政权统治时期，故宫博物院从来没有修缮过。解放后，仅清除的垃圾就有十八万多公方。每年都有大规模的保护性修缮工程。
    参观博物院的人越来越多。一九五三年和一九五四年的观众共有近三百万人，远远超过了解放前二十四年中观众的总人数。（新华社）
