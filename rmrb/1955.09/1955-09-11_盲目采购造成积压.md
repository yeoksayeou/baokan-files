    Blind Procurement Causes Stockpiling

    Editor:

    At the beginning of this year, the local state-owned Guxian Iron Factory already had a considerable amount of electrical materials in its warehouse, but they blindly purchased a large quantity from Taiyuan, Changzhi, and other places, resulting in serious stockpiling. Based on current usage, the eighteen-gauge rubber-insulated wire can be used for about four years; the fourteen-gauge seven-strand wire is sufficient for eight years; the sixteen-gauge seven-strand wire is sufficient for twenty-five years; and three hundred light bulbs are sufficient for twenty years. The factory also has a large stockpile of triangular rubber belts and other materials.

    In addition, the factory's procurement work often makes mistakes. For example, they originally wanted to buy fifty bottles of "DDT," but they bought five hundred and ten bottles instead; they originally wanted to buy twenty-four "DDT" sprayers, but they bought agricultural sprayers worth twenty-six yuan and nine jiao each. Under these circumstances, this small factory found a total of 288 kinds of stagnant materials when it recently cleared its inventory.

    Why is this happening? It turns out that this factory has many procurement personnel who often live in cities such as Tianjin and Taiyuan separately. When the factory wants to buy something, it simultaneously sends procurement notices to procurement personnel in various places, but often lacks specific requirements for the quantity and specifications of the purchased items, so over-purchasing and duplicate purchasing occur repeatedly. Strangely, the leading staff of this factory have been turning a blind eye to this chaotic phenomenon. In order to prevent state property from being stockpiled for a long time, they should immediately correct this erroneous behavior.

### 盲目采购造成积压

    盲目采购造成积压编辑同志：
    地方国营故县铁厂今年年初在仓库里已经存着不少电气材料，可是他们又盲目地到太原、长治等地大量购置，结果造成了严重的积压。根据目前使用情况，十八号胶皮电线可以用四年左右；十四号七股电线足够使用八年；十六号七股电线足够使用二十五年；三百支光灯泡足够使用二十年。这个厂的三角胶皮带等材料的积压数量也很大。此外，厂里的采购工作还经常出现错误。例如，本来要买五十瓶“滴滴涕”，结果买回来的是五百一十瓶；本来要买二十四个“滴滴涕”喷射器，结果买回来的是每个价值二十六元九角的农业上用的喷雾器。在这种情况下，这个规模不大的工厂，最近清理库存时，发现共有呆滞材料二百八十八种。
    为什么会这样呢？原来这个工厂有许多采购人员，经常分别住在天津、太原等城市。厂里要买一种东西，却同时向各地的采购人员发出采购通知，而对采购物品的数量、规格往往缺乏具体要求，因而多购、重购等现象屡次发生。奇怪的是，这个厂的领导工作人员对这种混乱现象一直是熟视无睹的。为了不再使国家财产长期积压，他们应该立即纠正这种错误行为。　　韦忠
