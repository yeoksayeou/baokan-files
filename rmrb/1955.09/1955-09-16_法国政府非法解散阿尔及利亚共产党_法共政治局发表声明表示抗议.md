    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 14th: The French government announced on the 13th the dissolution within French territory of the Algerian Communist Party, which fought for Algerian national independence. At the same time, all progressive and patriotic organizations in Algeria will also be dissolved under the pretext of so-called "organizations and associations split from the Algerian Communist Party or directly related to it."
    Prior to this, on the evening of the 12th, police of the French colonial authorities in Algeria had already conducted searches of the offices of the Algerian Communist Party and progressive groups throughout Algeria. In Algiers, the searches included the headquarters of the Algerian Communist Party, party grassroots organizations, and the office of the progressive newspaper "Républicain Algérois." "Républicain Algérois" did not publish on the 13th.
    Duclos, Chairman of the Communist Parliamentary Group in the French National Assembly, has already submitted a question to the Secretariat of the National Assembly regarding the illegal dissolution of the Algerian Communist Party, demanding an explanation of the circumstances under which the government made this decision. Duclos pointed out that this practice once again shows the French government's opposition to resolving the Algerian issue through negotiations and demonstrates its efforts to strengthen its policy of violence.
    Duclos emphasized that this policy has aroused public indignation among French residents.

    Xinhua News Agency, 15th: TASS, Paris, 14th: "L'Humanité" published a statement by the Politburo of the French Communist Party Central Committee regarding the Algerian Communist Party being declared illegal. The statement emphasized that this decision, made at the request of the French colonial group, is a manifestation of the policy of violence being implemented in Algeria. The Politburo emphasized that this policy is a threat to French democratic freedoms and violates the national interests of the French people.
    The Politburo protested against the banning of the Algerian Communist Party's activities and called on the French Communist Party to act in concert with the Socialists on the following basis: condemn repression, withdraw troops sent to North Africa, cancel mobilization orders, and hold negotiations with the qualified representatives of the Algerian and Moroccan people.

    法共政治局发表声明表示抗议
    新华社十四日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府十三日宣布在法国领土上解散为争取阿尔及利亚民族独立而奋斗的阿尔及利亚共产党。同时，阿尔及利亚的一切进步、爱国组织也要在所谓“从阿尔及利亚共产党分出来的或是同它有直接联系的组织和社团”的名义下被解散。
    在这以前，阿尔及利亚法国殖民当局的警察十二日晚间已经在阿尔及利亚各地对阿尔及利亚共产党和进步团体的办公处进行搜查。在阿尔及尔，被搜查的有阿尔及利亚共产党总部、党的基层组织和进步报纸“共和阿尔及尔报”报社。“共和阿尔及尔报”十三日没有出版。
    法国国民议会共产党议会党团主席杜克洛已经就非法解散阿尔及利亚共产党向国民议会秘书处提出质问，要求解释政府是在怎样的情况下作出这个决定的。杜克洛指出：这种做法再次表示了法国政府反对用谈判方式解决阿尔及利亚问题，并且说明它力求加强暴力政策。
    杜克洛着重指出：这种政策引起了法国居民的公愤。
    新华社十五日讯　塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党中央委员会政治局就阿尔及利亚共产党被宣布为非法事发表的声明。声明着重指出，这个根据法国殖民集团的要求而作出的决定是在阿尔及利亚执行暴力政策的表现。政治局着重指出，这种政策是对法国民主自由的威胁，并且违反法国人民的民族利益。
    政治局对于禁止阿尔及利亚共产党活动表示抗议，并且号召法国共产党在下列基础上同社会党人一致行动：谴责镇压，撤回派往北非的士兵，取消动员令，同阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥人民的有资格代表举行谈判。
