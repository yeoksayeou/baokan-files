Regarding the three instances of timber waste raised by Comrade Wang Zhonglan, our opinions are as follows:

    I. The reason we allocated pine wood to the State Material Reserve Bureau as dunnage in the first half of this year was because the order details submitted by the State Material Reserve Bureau and the plan approved by the State Planning Commission both specified general sawn timber. It was only during the specific negotiation of the order that we learned it was for use as dunnage. At that time, we requested the State Material Reserve Bureau to switch to using scrap railway ties and indicated in the allocation notice that allocation should be done with scrap railway ties. Later, because the State Material Reserve Bureau considered the specifications of scrap railway ties unsuitable and the quality too poor, we allocated general sawn timber to them.

    II. Regarding the sawing of poplar wood for box boards and the resulting accumulation of pine bark, the main reason is the price difference. According to state regulations, pine box boards cost over 90 yuan per cubic meter, while poplar logs cost just over 40 yuan per cubic meter for first-grade, just over 30 yuan for second-grade, and just over 20 yuan for third-grade. Therefore, the material-requiring departments mostly do not apply for pine box boards and prefer to receive poplar logs. In order to solve the problem of excess manufacturing capacity in Northeast China, we agreed to allocate poplar wood for the Northeast lumber mills to process into box boards for supply. As for the pine bark, we plan to allocate it to the Ministry of Fuel Industry for use as mine pit props. However, due to price issues, this has not yet been resolved.

    III. Regarding the supply of timber for vehicles, this is because the timber task of the Northeast Lumber Bureau under our ministry is small, and the equipment capacity has consistently not been fully utilized. To solve this problem, we have made various efforts, and supplying timber for vehicles is one of the measures. However, because we do not have an in-depth understanding of the complex and diverse vehicle models and specifications in our country, the timber produced is only semi-finished, and the material-requiring departments have to take it back for reprocessing. This is indeed a waste, and we have corrected this in the second half of the year, and are still supplying raw logs.

The opinions raised by Comrade Wang Zhonglan are indeed worthy of attention from the timber allocation departments. However, more importantly, our socialist construction has just begun, and the material requirements are complex, the distribution of processing capacity is uneven, and there are contradictions between production and sales. These are all fundamental problems that must be comprehensively considered and thoroughly resolved by the state.

    林业部供销局的说明
    对王中岚同志提出的三件浪费木材的情况，我们的意见如下：
    一、今年上半年，我们所以把松木拨给国家物资储备局做垫木，是因为国家物资储备局提出的订货明细表和国家计划委员会批准的计划里，都写的是一般锯材。到具体商洽订货的时候，我们才知道用做垫木。当时我们就要求国家物资储备局改用废枕木，并在调拨通知书附注中注明以废枕木调拨。后来因为国家物资储备局认为废枕木规格不合，质量太差，我们才把一般锯材拨给了他们。
    二、关于锯制杨木做箱板材，积压了松木板皮的问题，主要是因为价格关系。国家规定，松木箱板材每立方公尺为九十多元，而杨木原木每立方公尺一等只有四十多元，二等只有三十多元，三等只有二十多元。因此，需材部门多不申请松木箱板材而愿领用杨木原木。我们为了解决东北制材能力过剩的问题，同意拨给杨木，由东北制材厂加工为箱板材供应。至于松木板皮，我们打算调拨给燃料工业部做矿坑板。但也因为价格关系，现在还没有解决。
    三、关于供应车辆成材的问题，是因为我部所属的东北制材局的成材任务少，设备能力一直不能充分发挥。为了解决这个问题，我们曾多方设法，供应车辆成材就是其中的一个办法。但是，由于我们对我国车型复杂、规格繁多的情况没有深入的了解，所制成材只能是半成品，需材部门不得不领回重制。这确是一种浪费，我们在下半年已经改正，仍以原木供应。
    王中岚同志所提的意见，确实值得木材分配部门注意。但更主要的是我国社会主义建设刚刚开始，而需材规格复杂，加工能力分布不平衡，生产同销售有矛盾。这些都是具有根本性的问题，必须由国家统盘考虑，彻底解决。
