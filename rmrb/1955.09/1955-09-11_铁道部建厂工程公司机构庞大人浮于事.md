To the Editor:

I am an employee of the Ministry of Railways' Construction Factory Engineering Company. The company's overstaffed and inefficient organizational structure is extremely serious, causing huge losses to the country.

In 1953, under the slogans of so-called "specialization," "mechanization," and "factory production," the Ministry of Railways established the Construction Factory Engineering Company and successively established four engineering divisions in Beijing, Chengdu, Shenyang, and Baotou. However, because there was not much work to do after setting up this operation, the Construction Factory Engineering Company had to contract some civil construction projects. Even so, the phenomenon of idleness is still very serious. In 1954 alone, there were 115,196 workdays lost due to idleness, resulting in losses of more than 180,000 yuan. The situation has not changed this year. More than 100 people in the Second Engineering Division still have nothing to do; more than 400 people in the Third Engineering Division have had nothing to do since April, and it is said that they will not have tasks until after October. The ratio of non-production personnel to production personnel (excluding temporary workers) in the Construction Factory Engineering Company is also surprisingly large, such as about 1 to 1.8 in the Third and Fourth Engineering Divisions. These situations show that the structure of the Construction Factory Engineering Company is very large.

The work of the Construction Factory Engineering Company is very chaotic. The company's leadership has adopted the practice of "generous estimation and use" in material supply work, resulting in serious inventory backlog and waste. According to incomplete statistics, the value of backlog and stagnant materials has reached more than 1.2 million yuan. In addition, there are countless phenomena of material corrosion and deterioration due to improper storage, as well as the use of long materials for short purposes and the use of high-quality materials for inferior purposes in construction. Because of the blind purchase of machinery, there are still 112 machines that are often left unused; the utilization rate of the more than 300 machines that have been used is generally only about 20%. In construction, the various engineering divisions under the Construction Factory Engineering Company not only have low work efficiency, but also very poor engineering quality. For example, the Third Engineering Division contracted the overhaul project of the Huangguantun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory last year. Because the quality did not meet the standards, it reworked for more than four months, wasting more than 39,000 yuan in labor and material costs alone.

The serious idleness phenomenon of the Construction Factory Engineering Company not only caused great losses to the country, but also affected the lives of some workers. For example, among the more than 400 idle workers in the Third Engineering Division, 70 people actually earned less than 30 yuan in May, 90 people earned less than 20 yuan, and more than 140 people earned less than 10 yuan.

I hope that the Ministry of Railways will seriously study and take effective measures to change the overstaffing situation of the Construction Factory Engineering Company.

### 铁道部建厂工程公司机构庞大人浮于事

    铁道部建厂工程公司机构庞大人浮于事编辑同志：
    我是铁道部建厂工程公司的一个工作人员。我们公司机构庞大、人浮于事的现象十分严重，给国家造成了巨大的损失。
    一九五三年，铁道部在所谓“专业化”、“机械化”和“工厂化”的口号下，设立了建厂工程公司，并且先后在北京、成都、沈阳和包头建立了四个工程处。但是，由于摆起这个摊子以后并没有多少事情可做，建厂工程公司不得不承包一部分民用建筑工程。虽然如此，窝工现象仍然很严重。一九五四年全年就窝工十一万五千一百九十六个工作日，损失在十八万元以上。今年的情况还是没有改变，第二工程处有一百多人至今没有事情做；第三工程处从四月份以来就有四百多人没有事情做，据说要到十月份以后才有任务。建厂工程公司的非生产人员和生产人员（不包括临时工）的比例也大得十分惊人，如第三和第四两个工程处都是一比一点八左右。这些情况说明建厂工程公司的机构是十分庞大的。
    建厂工程公司的工作十分混乱，公司领导方面在材料供应工作中采取了“宽打宽用”的做法，造成了严重的积压浪费现象。据不完全统计，到目前为止，积压呆滞的材料价值就达一百二十万元以上。此外，因保管不当使材料腐蚀变质以及在施工中长材短用、优材劣用的现象，也是多得不胜枚举的。因为盲目购置机械，至今还有一百一十二台机器经常搁置不用；已经使用的三百多台机器，利用率一般也只有百分之二十左右。建厂工程公司所属各工程处在施工中，不仅工作效率低，工程质量也非常差。如第三工程处在去年承包皇姑屯机车车辆修理工厂的大修工程，因为质量不合标准，返工四个多月，仅在人工和材料费方面就浪费了三万九千多元。
    建厂工程公司的严重窝工现象，不仅给国家造成了很大的损失，而且使一部分工人的生活受到了影响。例如，第三工程处四百多名窝工工人中，五月份实得工资不满三十元的有七十人，不满二十元的有九十人，不满十元的有一百四十多人。
    我希望铁道部认真地研究一下，采取有效措施，改变建厂工程公司人浮于事的情况。
