The World Peace Council's decision to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the Ajanta murals of India this year is of great significance to the cause of people of all countries in maintaining the culture of all nations and promoting peaceful coexistence.

Buddhist art first appeared in ancient India very early, and was further developed during the reign of Emperor Ashoka (approximately 272-232 BC). It is said that Emperor Ashoka built 84,000 stupas (the origin of pagodas) to honor the Buddha, some of which can still be seen today.

The Ajanta caves are located on the ridges of the Vindhya Mountains in the northwest of Hyderabad Province, India. Two thousand years ago, Buddhist monks chose this quiet valley, which is indeed a scenic spot with mountains, rivers, forests and trees. The caves were carved on the cliff overlooking the mountain stream and embracing an arc. After about six or seven centuries, a row of 29 caves were successively carved. The earliest caves were in the central part of this row, and later caves were added to extend to both sides. Therefore, the closer to the two ends, the later the date. However, for convenience, archaeologists do not follow the order in which the caves were carved, but number them sequentially from left to right.

The murals in the caves, in terms of artistic expression and structure, are very close to the simple and unadorned style of the stone carvings on the four gates of the Great Stupa of Sanchi in the earliest period (the stone carvings on the four gates of the Great Stupa of Sanchi, the murals and stone carvings of the "Bagh" Caves, the stone carvings of "Ellora", etc., are also outstanding masterpieces of ancient Indian art). It is obvious that they share the style of Central Indian art. Therefore, archaeologists believe that the first phase of the Ajanta murals was roughly in the Andro Dynasty (27 BC – 236 AD). Although today's historians do not know much about the historical materials of the political and social conditions at that time, such caves were undoubtedly built under the will of the local rulers who possessed strong economic power. The caves belonging to the first phase are the ninth, tenth, and their neighboring seventh, eighth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth, a total of seven. The second phase of the caves extends to the right from the central part of the cliff, namely the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth, a total of six. Chronologically, it is much later than the previous period, roughly equivalent to the fourth to sixth centuries AD. The first to sixth caves at the left end of the cliff are structurally similar to the twentieth to twenty-ninth caves at the other end of the cliff. The excavation of these sixteen caves at both ends belongs to the third phase, roughly between the sixth and seventh centuries AD, which was just before the decline of Buddhism in India began.

The construction forms of the Ajanta caves can be divided into two types: one is the "Chaitya" cave, which is a Buddhist temple. Its structure is generally: a gorgeous door carved on the front, with a bright window on the top of the door, inside are two strong columns, and the innermost part is a stupa, which is a tower for storing Buddhist relics. The cave top is vaulted and carved with beams and rafters according to the style of wooden architecture. The other form is "Vihara", which is a place for monks to study and live. Generally, there is a colonnaded porch in front, an entrance and window openings. Inside, in the center, is an almost square "Dharma hall", surrounded by colonnaded corridors. On the front, a niche with a large Buddha statue is carved on the cliff. Several rows of small door openings are chiseled on the inner stone wall, each door leading to a dark cell. The couch and pillows in them are all carved from the cliff. The cave top is "coffered", which still imitates the form of wooden squares supporting the ceiling of wooden architecture.

Among the twenty-nine caves in Ajanta, only the ninth, tenth, nineteenth, twenty-sixth, and the unfinished twenty-eighth, a total of five "Chaitya" caves, the remaining twenty-four caves are all "Viharas". After these caves were carved, in addition to coloring the carved parts, a layer of a specially made mixed clay was applied to the rough stone surface, which was further processed before the murals were painted. The Ajanta murals and sculptures, over six or seven centuries, gathered the high wisdom of countless outstanding artists, inheriting and developing the glorious tradition of ancient Indian culture. Unfortunately, this world-famous treasure house of Buddhist art, especially the mural part, has suffered natural and man-made damage, and only a small part has survived to this day after 1,500 years. Among the twenty-nine caves, except for a few caves that were originally unfinished, which never had murals or sculptures, only the first, second, ninth, tenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth caves have relatively more remnants. This "Commemorative Exhibition of the 1500th Anniversary of the Ajanta Murals of India" mainly introduces the art of these caves.

In the first phase of the Ajanta caves, such as the ninth and tenth caves, only vague fragments remain, and the paintings are almost invisible due to ignorant graffiti. But if we carefully study them, we can still recognize that the murals in the tenth cave narrate a story from the Jataka of the Six-Tusked Elephant, depicting how the Buddha's previous life, the white elephant king with six tusks, was shot and killed by a hunter, and the tragic situation of the queen of Baranasi repenting and dying when she saw the six elephant tusks sent by the hunter. The images of people and animals are expressed in a simple and powerful way. Another wall depicts the procession of the king, queen and attendants, which similarly shows that the earliest painters of Ajanta were not groping in the dark, but were already rigorously trained artists capable of exerting their creativity, and were inheritors and developers of ancient Indian art.

The historical background of the excavation of the second phase of the caves is also little known. The murals of this period are full of life and rhythm, giving people an uplifting feeling. The rich imagination of the painters can be seen in many works, using gorgeous colors to depict vivid human life. The painters used religious stories to reflect various aspects of real life on these walls. Geographically, Ajanta is located in the northwest corner of the Deccan Plateau, under the rule of a small Vakataka dynasty in this region, but it worthily and brilliantly represents the culture of the golden age of the once-prosperous Gupta dynasty. The artists of Ajanta often keenly observed life, and their works show that they were not hermits who lived in the mountains and forests and ascetics who hated the world. They reflected the true faces of all social strata, from rulers to so-called "untouchables", through art.

The murals in the sixteenth cave have few remnants, but it is an important representative work of this period. On the right wall of the cave is "Conversion of Nanda", and on the left wall are sections of the "Collection of the Deeds of the Buddha" (from the conception of Queen Maya to the attainment of enlightenment). Although the murals are damaged, it can still be seen that some plots are depicted vividly and realistically. For example, when Siddhartha's wife, Yashodhara, discovered that her husband had abandoned his home to seek the Way, she was overwhelmed with grief, and the maids around her were at a loss. This is a mature realistic expression technique in art.

The murals in the seventeenth cave are the best preserved. The content of the murals is several stories from the "Collection of the Deeds of the Buddha", and most of them are various legends from the Jataka tales. In the same cave, the large structure in the middle depicts King Vijaya landing on the island of Ceylon. The painting combines various images such as people, elephants, carts, and horses, and diverse plots into one picture to express. The Ajanta painters of this period had skillfully mastered the outlining of lines and the control of colors. The expression of the characters' images and the organization of the paintings had gradually developed from simple and powerful to complex and organized, and they exerted the enthusiastic emotions of an epic poem. Standing in front of these full-width, surging murals, one feels like hearing a symphonic movement. From these gigantic structures created with amazing skill, we cannot neglect some small groups of figures that are full of emotion and lifelike. We are attracted by that fresh, lively, and intimate look. The images shaped here are not artificial, aloof gods and immortals, nor are they grotesque ghosts. What the Ajanta painters wanted to depict was "people", solemn and various kinds of "people".

The murals of the third phase are considered to be the most mature works of Ajanta art. On the left wall of the second cave, the king's procession in the "Ruru Jataka" is imposing and orderly, yet varied. On the same wall, the merchant Pabila in the "Purna Avadana" encounters danger while sailing and is rescued. It is decorative, imaginative, and depicts many scenes of Indian life at that time. The "Collection of the Deeds of the Buddha" depicts the birth of the Buddha, and its portrayal of the charming and graceful posture of women is unique at the time. The "Syama Jataka" in the first cave depicts the kind snake king, and another Jataka story depicts the compassionate prince who would rather donate his own flesh and blood to save a pigeon. In this cave, in addition to materials taken from the "Jataka tales" and "Biography of the Buddha", there are also a few taken from contemporary real events. The famous "Audience of the Persian Envoy" is a historical event in which the Indian King Pulakeshin II received the envoys of the Persian Khosrau II Parviz dynasty, which took place in 626-628 AD. These paintings are mostly blurred, but the more complete giant "Mahajanaka Jataka", as well as the ceiling decorations of these first and second caves, show more change and creativity. Although the painter does not use strong light and dark rendering in the modeling of the characters, he can fully express the roundness and luster of the skin. He uses concise lines to outline a definite shape, but does not therefore separate the form from its environment. Such a high degree of development of Buddhist art is in line with the prosperity of Buddhism at that time.

This is not the first time that the Ajanta cave murals have been introduced to China. Indian Buddhist art, which came to China with Buddhism, has a long history. Master Xuanzang once mentioned the splendid Buddhist temples of Ajanta in the eleventh volume of the "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions", describing the grandeur of the caves at that time. We have also found the stone steps he took when he visited Ajanta and the two large stone elephants in front of the temple gate. Seeing the Ajanta murals makes us feel more familiar and 친근. The Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, the Maijishan Grottoes, as well as the murals in Kuqa and Gaochang, etc. in China, are all Buddhist art sites like the Ajanta Grottoes, expressing similar content and more or less connected styles. What is even more interesting is that in the Ajanta murals, the painting method of individual characters uses hooks with the meaning of Chinese calligraphy, with the characteristics of the rise and fall of the strokes, the lightness and heaviness of the brush, and the changes with the shape. This is something that we should cherish.

The Ajanta cave murals are not only a treasure house of Indian Buddhist art, but also a treasure of human culture worldwide. Today, we want to commemorate the great creation of ancient Indian artists and commemorate the profound friendship and cultural exchanges between the great people of China and India, which began in ancient times. This friendship and exchange have today had important new developments and further consolidation, which is of great significance to the cause of world peace. People all over the world realize that only with peace can there be cultural prosperity, so that art treasures like Ajanta will never suffer again.

    阿旃陀壁画一千五百年纪念
    中国美术家协会副主席　吴作人
    世界和平理事会决定在今年纪念印度阿旃陀壁画的一千五百年，这对于各国人民为维护各民族的文化、增进和平共处的事业是有重要意义的。
    佛教艺术很早就在古代的印度开始出现，到阿育王时代（约公元前二七二——二三二）而更为发扬。阿育王为了敬佛，建立的窣堵波（即塔的起源形式）相传有八万四千座，其中一部分，至今我们还可以看得到。
    阿旃陀石窟在印度的海德拉巴省西北部文达雅山脉的岭子上。两千年以前，就有佛教僧众选择了这幽静的山谷，这里的确是一处有山水林木的胜境。在下临山涧、环抱作弧形的悬崖上，开凿了石窟。经过了约六、七个世纪，先后凿造了一排共二十九窟。最早的石窟是在这一排的中央部分，后来增加的石窟向两侧伸展。所以愈近两端的年代就愈晚。但是考古家为了方便，并不依石窟凿造的先后，而是从左至右顺序编号。
    石窟的壁画，在艺术表现上、在结构上，最早的很接近山奇大窣堵波四门石刻的古拙的风格（山奇大窣堵波四门石刻，和“巴格”石窟的壁画和石刻、“爱罗拉”的石刻等，同是印度古代艺术杰出的巨构），明显地看得出同是中印度艺术造形的风格，因此考古家们认为阿旃陀壁画的第一期大致是在安德罗王朝（公元前二七年——公元后二三六年）时代。虽然对于当时政治、社会的历史材料，今天的历史家们知道的不多，但是，这样的石窟无疑地是在拥有雄厚经济力量的当地的统治者的意旨下兴建的。属于第一期的石窟是第九、十和它们左右两邻的第七、八、十一、十二、十三号，一共是七个。第二期的石窟是由悬崖中央部分向右伸延，即第十四、十五、十六、十七、十八和十九号，共六个。在年代上比前期要晚得多，约相当于公元第四到第六世纪。在石崖左端的第一到第六号，同石崖另一端的从第二十到二十九号大体的结构相似，这两端的十六个石窟的开凿，是属于第三期的，大约在公元第六、七世纪之间，正是佛教在印度开始衰退的前夕。
    阿旃陀石窟的建造形式可以分作两种：一种是“支提”窟，就是佛殿，它的结构一般是：正面雕琢华丽的大门，门顶有明窗，进去是两下粗壮的列柱，最里是一座窣堵波，就是藏佛舍利的塔，窟顶卷式，并且按照木构建筑的样式，雕出梁架和椽子。另一种形式是“精舍”，就是僧侣进修和起居的地方，一般是：前面是列柱长廊、入门和窗洞，里面正中就是近乎正方形的“道场”，四周列柱游廊，正面就石崖雕大佛像一龛，向里的石壁上凿开了几排狭小的门洞，每个门各通一间幽黑的寮房，其中的榻和枕，都是从山崖雕凿出来的，窟顶是“平棋”，也还是模仿木构建筑的木方格，承托着天花板的形式。
    在阿旃陀的二十九个石窟中间，只有第九、十、十九、二十六和未完成的第二十八号共五个“支提”窟，其余二十四个石窟都是“精舍”。这些石窟凿成以后，除了在雕刻部分上彩，还要在粗糙的石头面上用特制的一种混合黏土罩上一层，在这上面再经过加工，然后才进行壁画绘制工作。阿旃陀的壁画和雕刻，在上下六、七个世纪间集合了无数优秀艺人的高度智慧，承继和发展了古代印度文化的光辉传统。可惜，这个举世闻名的佛教艺术宝库，尤其是壁画部分，遭受了天然的和人为的损害，一千五百年以来，所能遗留到今天的仅是很少一部分了。二十九个石窟中，少数几个原来就没有完成的石窟，里面从未有过壁画或雕刻的除外，只有第一、二、九、十、十六和十七号共六个石窟里面残剩着的算是比较多些。在这次“印度阿旃陀壁画一千五百年纪念展览”里，主要是介绍这几个石窟的艺术。
    阿旃陀第一期石窟，像第九、第十号里只残存着模糊不清的片断，加以被人无知地涂划，画面几乎看不出来了。但是要仔细去揣摩，我们还能辨认出第十号窟的壁画是叙述着六牙象本生经里的一段故事，描写佛陀前生六牙白象王如何被猎人射杀，以及婆罗尼斯国的王妃看到猎人送来的六支象牙时悔恨而死的凄惋情状。人物和动物的形象表现得朴素有力。另一壁面上所描写国王、王妃和侍从的行列，都同样说明阿旃陀最早期的画家已经不是在渺茫中摸索，而是已经受过严格锻炼的、有能力发挥自己的创造性的艺术家，是古老印度艺术的继承者和发扬者。
    第二期石窟凿造的历史背景，也还知道得很少。这个时期的壁画充满着生命和动律，给人以振奋的感情，在许多作品里可以看出画家的丰富想像力，运用瑰丽的色调，描绘着生动的人世生活。画家在这些壁面上，借用了宗教故事反映出现实生活的各个方面。从地理上看起来，阿旃陀偏处在德干高原的西北角，在一个本地区的伐伽沓伽小王朝的统治下，可是它无愧地、出色地代表着盛极一时的笈多王朝黄金时期的文化。阿旃陀的艺术家经常敏锐地观察着生活，在作品里说明了他们并不是避居山林的隐士和厌恶人世的苦行者，他们通过艺术反映出社会的各个阶层，从统治者到所谓“贱民”的真实面貌。
    第十六号石窟里的壁画残剩不多，但这是属于这个时期的重要的代表作。在石窟右壁的是“教化难陀”，左壁的是“佛本行集经”的各节（摩耶夫人受胎起一直到成正果）。壁画虽然残坏，但仍然可以看得出有些情节是描写得生动真实的。像悉达太子的妻子耶输陀罗，发现丈夫弃家求道，她忧伤欲绝，宫女们在她的周围凄惶不知所措的情景，是艺术上达到了成熟的现实主义的表现手法。
    第十七窟的壁画是保存得最多的。壁画内容是“佛本行集经”里的几段故事，大多数是本生经里的各种传说。在同一个石窟里，大幅结构中间画有维伽那王在锡兰岛登岸。画里面把人、象、车、马等各种形象和多样的情节综合在一个画面上来表现。这个时期的阿旃陀画家，已经娴熟地掌握了线的钩描，色彩的支配，对于人物形象的表现，画面的组织，已从单纯有力逐渐发展到复杂而有条理，发挥了叙事诗似的热情洋溢的感情。站在这些满幅腾动的壁画面前，感觉像听到了交响乐章。从这些以惊人的功力创造出来的巨构里面，我们不能疏忽其中一些充满了感情的、栩栩如生的小组人物。我们会被那种清新、活泼和亲切的神态所吸引。这里塑造的形象，并不是矫揉造作、高不可攀的神灵天仙，也不是奇形异状的鬼魅。阿旃陀画家所要描写的是“人”，庄严的和各种各样的“人”。
    第三期的壁画是被认为阿旃陀艺术最成熟阶段的作品。第二号石窟左壁上“隐居知者本生经”里的国王出行，仪仗人马，声势逼人，表现得整齐有序而又有变化。同面壁上“富楼那譬喻经”里的商人波毗罗航海遇险得救，有装饰意味，想像力丰富，描写出很多印度当时的生活情景。“佛本行集经”描绘着佛的出生，其中对于刻划妇女的妩媚轻盈的体态，是独步当时的。第一号石窟里的“数果本生经”，描写善良的蛇王，和另一则本生经故事描写慈悲的王子为了救鸽，宁愿捐出自己的血肉来。在这个石窟里，除了从“本生经”和“佛传”中间取材而外，也有少数取自当时的现实事件。著名的“波斯使臣朝见”，是画印度王普拉皑新接见波斯拘尸卢·帕尔维茨王朝的使节的历史事件，是公元六二六——六二八的事。这些画多已模糊不清了，比较完整的“大知本生经”巨幅，还有这第一、二两个石窟的天花板装饰，更显出富于变化和创造力。画家对人物的造形，虽不采用强烈的明暗渲染，就已能充分表现肌肤的圆润光泽，运用简练的线条钩出肯定的外形，却没有因此而把形体同它的环境割裂开来。佛教艺术这样的高度发展是和当时佛教的盛极一时相适应的。
    阿旃陀石窟壁画在中国不是第一次介绍了，随着佛教而来中国的印度佛教艺术已经有久远的历史。玄奘法师在“大唐西域记”第十一卷里曾经提到过阿旃陀辉煌的佛寺，描写过石窟在当时的盛况，我们也已经找到他当年在阿旃陀朝山巡礼所走过的石阶和寺院门前的两只石雕大象。我们看到阿旃陀壁画因而更觉得熟习和亲切。在中国的敦煌莫高窟、大同云岗石窟、洛阳龙门石窟、麦积山石窟，以及库车和高昌壁画等等，都和阿旃陀石窟同为佛教艺术胜迹，表现的是相似的内容和或多或少的相通的风格。更可感兴趣的是，在阿旃陀壁画中，有个别人物的画法，运用了含有中国书法意味的钩线，具有运笔起落、轻重虚实、随形变化的特点。这是值得我们珍视的。
    阿旃陀壁画不只是印度佛教艺术的宝库，同时也是全世界人类文化的瑰宝。今天我们要纪念印度古代艺术家的伟大的创造，纪念远在古代就已开始的中国和印度两个国家伟大人民的深厚友谊和文化交流。这种友谊和交流，今天有了重要的新的发展和更进一步的巩固，这对世界和平事业有极大意义。全世界的人民都认识到只有和平，才能有文化的繁荣，才能使像阿旃陀这样艺术宝库永不遭劫。（附图片）
