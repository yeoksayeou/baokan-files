Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni jointly telegraphed the First Session of the Second People's Congress of Xinjiang Province and the Preparatory Committee for the National Regional Autonomy of Xinjiang Province, congratulating them on the establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The full text is as follows: To the First Session of the Second People's Congress of Xinjiang Province and the Preparatory Committee for the National Regional Autonomy of Xinjiang Province:

	On the occasion of the imminent establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, we, on behalf of all the monks and lay people in Tibet, extend our congratulations to you and the people of the Uygur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

	The establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is a great joyous event for the Uygur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang, another glorious victory for the ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and all the fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland's big family and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are jointly rejoicing and encouraged by this.

	In the five years since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's governments at all levels, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have laid a solid foundation in terms of unity with the Han people and unity among other ethnic groups in Xinjiang; and have made great achievements in economic and cultural construction. This has not only created favorable conditions for the realization of national regional autonomy, but also demonstrates the vigorous development of all ethnic groups in the affectionate and cooperative family of the motherland since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The achievements made by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang in supporting and assisting the socialist construction of the motherland and creating a happy life for their own ethnic groups have greatly encouraged the people of Tibet. We firmly believe that after the establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will cooperate even better in strengthening national unity and managing the affairs of their own ethnic groups, and economic and cultural construction will also accelerate.

	While celebrating the establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the preparatory work for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is also proceeding smoothly. The Tibetan people will certainly, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, learn from the advanced example of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, continue to strengthen the friendly unity with fraternal ethnic groups and within Tibet, raise patriotic ideology, and, with the help of the Han people, gradually realize national regional autonomy based on the specific conditions of Tibet, and strive to develop Tibet's economic and cultural undertakings, so as to build our great motherland and move forward hand in hand with all fraternal ethnic groups.

	In addition to having sent Taiji Gexue·Quejiniima and Kanchen Losang Tsanle to participate in the celebrations, we once again express our congratulations to our fraternal ethnic group, the Xinjiang Uygur people, and other fraternal ethnic groups.

    新华社拉萨二十六日电　达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼联名致电新疆省第一届第二次人民代表大会和新疆省民族区域自治筹备委员会，庆祝新疆维吾尔自治区成立。全文如下：新疆省第一届第二次人民代表大会并新疆省民族区域自治筹备委员会：
    值此新疆维吾尔自治区即将成立之际，我们代表西藏全体僧俗人民，向你们和新疆维吾尔族及其他各族人民致以祝贺。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，是新疆维吾尔族及其他各族人民的一件大喜事，是中国共产党、毛主席的民族政策的又一次的光辉胜利，祖国大家庭各兄弟民族人民和新疆各族人民都为此共同欢欣鼓舞。
    解放后的五年多来，新疆各族人民在中国共产党和各级人民政府领导下，在与汉族人民的团结以及新疆其他各族之间的团结方面，奠定了巩固的基础；在经济、文化建设方面取得了很大成绩。这不仅为实现民族区域自治创造了良好的条件，同时显示了自中华人民共和国成立以来，各民族在友爱合作的祖国大家庭里的蓬勃发展。新疆各族人民在支持、支援祖国社会主义建设和创造本民族幸福生活中所取得的成就，给予了西藏人民以很大鼓舞。我们坚信新疆维吾尔自治区成立后，在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院领导下，新疆各族人民在加强民族团结和管理本民族的事务方面合作得更好，经济、文化建设也将加快速度。
    在庆贺新疆维吾尔自治区成立的同时，成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的准备工作也正在顺利进行。藏族人民一定在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的领导下，学习新疆维吾尔自治区的先进榜样，继续加强和兄弟民族以及西藏内部的友爱团结，提高爱国主义思想，在汉族的帮助下，依据西藏的具体情况，逐步实现民族区域自治，努力发展西藏的经济和文化事业，为建设我们伟大的祖国和各兄弟民族携手前进。
    除已派台吉噶雪·却吉尼玛和堪穷洛桑参勒前往参加庆祝外，我们再次向兄弟民族新疆维吾尔族及其他兄弟民族表示祝贺。
                    达赖喇嘛
                    班禅额尔德尼
                      一九五五年九月二十五日
