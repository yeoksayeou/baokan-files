    Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Workers Youth Shock Brigade
    Lei Jia
    In the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade, labor discipline is very strict, and everyone voluntarily abides by it without the slightest reluctance. They guarantee an attendance rate of 99. something percent.
    Perhaps some people think they've been like this since the team was formed, but that's not actually the case. The following little thing can explain everything.
    Once, a security comrade at the construction site gave Captain Zhang Baifa an opinion: "You all hold twisting hooks and tie steel bars all day long. But what's the point of it all? You don't even wear your own symbols on your chest..." Zhang Baifa wears his symbol on his chest every day, so the security comrade's words naturally referred to the people in his team. If it were someone else, he would nitpick a bit, saying that other teams also have people who don't wear them; or he would just set an example himself. Since the captain himself wears a symbol, he would then wag his finger at the team members and say: "Look! My symbol is worn on my chest, you should also..." or even more severely, add a sentence: "Be conscious of it! Comrades!" But Zhang Baifa doesn't do that. He has another approach. The next morning, all the symbols of the Zhang Baifa team were worn on their chests. If you look closely, the pins for the symbols are all new, bought by Zhang Baifa from the cooperative. The team members didn't say a second word, they all pinned on their symbols with the pins. While pinning them on, they were filled with a sense of pride: "We are a Youth Shock Brigade! We can't be sloppy on small things!"
    The Zhang Baifa team is a master of catching up with progress. They always exceed the task by more than 30 percent. The numbers they initially set to the numbers now are like climbing a mountain. They climb up step by step, not feeling anything; but people standing at the foot of the mountain, seeing them standing on the peak, are always in awe and amazement.
    The glory of the Zhang Baifa team is mainly manifested in accepting tasks. Zhang Baifa's characteristic is to boldly accept tasks; of course, it wasn't like this at first. The first task, he agreed to with a stiff upper lip, the second task he undertook with daring. Later he understood that all arduous, difficult, tasks that need to be led, and tasks with deadlines, if not handed over to the Youth Shock Brigade, who should they be handed over to? Sometimes the leaders first consult with him, and Zhang Baifa says: "We are a Youth Shock Brigade! We should... definitely..." The leaders then ask if there are any difficulties? He then says: "If there are difficulties, we will overcome them ourselves! We are a Youth Shock Brigade!" He remembers the first two times, these words were originally said by the leaders, and with an encouraging tone: "You are a Youth Shock Brigade! You should... definitely..." "If there are difficulties, you overcome them yourselves. You are a Youth Shock Brigade!"
    But initially, in the eyes of some team members, this characteristic of his was not a characteristic at all, but the biggest shortcoming.
    It turned out that the captain was only nineteen years old when the team was formed. Most of the team members were a little older than him, and their skills were also a little better. He only had some weaving skills and had only recently switched to the construction industry. According to the team members, he was just a young kid with unkempt hair, with no characteristics at all. At the beginning, he took on the job of digging sewers, and some team members thought this was the most inappropriate thing to do. But how could they know that Zhang Baifa had undergone a major test when the team was formed! The establishment of this Youth Shock Brigade was proposed by Zhang Baifa after returning from the Municipal Party Committee Youth League School. He said: "The construction of the Soviet Exhibition Hall has a Youth Shock Brigade, why shouldn't we have one?" The leaders thought this idea was very good, but it needed to be carefully considered. "If you want to establish one, it has to look like something, you can't collapse halfway." At that time, Zhang Baifa replied: "With the leadership and education of the Party and the Youth League, how can it collapse?" In this way, the Youth Shock Brigade was established. Once the team was established, the task came down. He didn't accept the task without bargaining. When the leaders gave them the task of digging sewers, he argued that they were all steel bar workers, and the quota of 2.5 meters for digging sewers seemed too high. His clear intention was to do steel bar work. There was no steel bar work at the time. The comrades of the Youth League branch said to him: "Go and do it! With the leadership and help of the Youth League, you will definitely be able to complete it." These were exactly the words he had said when forming the team. Hearing these words, he quickly agreed.
    Zhang Baifa first held a meeting with the Youth League members in the team. They all supported him. Someone said that digging sewers is a physical job, and you can break the quota by selling some strength. It was unanimously agreed to control the plan at 2.8 meters and strive to reach 3 meters. At the opening ceremony rally, they put forward this number and received a warm welcome. The first day went well, digging seven meters. Someone asked how these seven meters were dug? Everyone was not yet very good at summarizing experience, looking at the blisters on their hands, they thought: Besides enthusiasm, what else is there? The next day, they dug another seven meters, and they almost had to take the guarantee back to revise the numbers every day. At that time, the bricklaying team was also working with the Youth Shock Brigade. The bricklayers heard these kids proposing 2.8 meters at the rally, and some secretly laughed and said: "2.8 meters, 3 meters, is it worth babbling on the stage!" Later, when they heard that they had dug seven meters, they said: "It's lucky that you are young, you have a trick now; but when you dig down, and water comes out, I guarantee you won't be able to dig even one meter." Five-meter-deep ditches, two meters deep have ginger stone, four meters deep encounter quicksand, and further down is groundwater... it is indeed difficult enough.
    But the numbers are still increasing. There is a team member in their team named Ren Fuchou. Zhang Baifa had talked with him and encouraged him to strive to join the Youth League. Ren Fuchou proposed to guarantee 100 percent attendance. He had four or five large blisters on his hands, but he refused to rest. He said that this was nothing, far worse than Huang Jiguang! There is also Zhao Shousheng, who works like a tiger, but he is the youngest, and everyone loves him. He twisted his waist, and the captain didn't assign him work, but he refused to go back, stood by the ditch to clean up the soil, and brought water for the team members to drink.
    There is also a Cao Shengyou, who is strong and tall, but doesn't like to talk. He was uneasy as soon as he joined the team. There is a reason for this: of the twelve people in the team, eight had known each other before, and he and three others were transferred from other places, so he always felt awkward; but he didn't blame himself for not being gregarious, but blamed others for isolating him. He thought to himself: "I'll leave early, so they don't bully the countryman." One day, he ran to an acquaintance who was working at the "Beiyi" construction site and told him all these things. This acquaintance was called Zhang Zhengang. After listening to his words, he clicked his tongue and said: "You still say you are a countryman? You can't even see who is an honest person. Zhang Baifa used to be my apprentice, I know. You say he is young, I have seen a lot of young people, but there are not many young people as honest as him." In this way, after he went back, he didn't say anything and worked wholeheartedly.
    When this section of the project was completed, another section of the project was assigned: digging stinky ditches. Zhang Baifa had long calculated that this task would be difficult to handle if it fell into his hands, but it just happened to fall into his hands. He said to Master Zhang: "The task, is it wrong!" He was right to say this, if there was steel bar work, they should have done steel bar work long ago. But Master Zhang said without hesitation: "If you don't do this work, who will do it? You are all young lads! And you are a Youth Shock Brigade! Don't say anymore!" Zhang Baifa also quickly said: "Don't say anymore!" The task was settled.
    These days, everyone has become familiar with each other's temperaments. Only a young man named Xiao Deng, everyone can't figure out where he got such a big temper, he clashes with whoever he touches, he is truly a "live wire." He and Xiao Liu had both been team leaders on other construction sites, and Zhang Baifa was worried about him. Sure enough, he blew up. He pointed at Zhang Baifa and said: "You also accepted this task." Listening to his tone, if it were him, he would have rejected it long ago. Zhang Baifa still remained calm and explained: "I also said we shouldn't do it; but if we don't do it, who will?" He dragged out the words "we". It's not hard to understand, since we are a Youth Shock Brigade, if difficult work doesn't fall to us, who does it fall to? Xiao Deng became even more agitated when he heard him say this: "Humph! In these twenty-odd days, we have just made some achievements, and you have accepted such a task again. This time it will be very embarrassing if we don't reach the quota." He was thinking of the reputation of the Youth Shock Brigade, and the reason was quite sufficient. So after he finished speaking, he put down his face and refused to take it back. Someone suggested a mitigating opinion: "If we are afraid of not completing it, can we lower the quota?" Originally, the leadership also had this intention: since it is difficult, the quota can be lowered. But that Cao Shengyou—the one who had been working honestly since returning from "Beiyi"—spoke. To be honest, no one could remember when he had last said a word. At this time, he said: "It's not easy to dig, but we can't lower the quota, I... no, can't we come up with an idea?..." His voice was not loud, nor was it special; but the idea he came up with was very good. He advocated using a hoist to transport the soil upwards, which was not only much better than throwing soil with a shovel, but also solved the problem of the ditch being deep and the soil not being able to be thrown up and returning along the shovel handle. With this hoist, they again overfulfilled the task. The work area issued masks to prevent the stench, and the clinic also issued cotton and medicine. The medicine was really effective, first it "deafened" the nose, and you couldn't smell anything. But, the main thing was that all the team members were presenting a gift for "May Day," so they raised the quota to 14 meters, overfulfilling it by 250 percent.
    After "May Day," they accepted a task of their own profession: tying steel bars for the building of the Third Construction Site. They tied a total of 108 tons, overfulfilling the task by more than 30 percent.
    An incident occurred here.
    According to the work sequence, the carpenters make wooden boxes in front, the steel bar workers lay the steel bars, tie them, and then pour cement. If the steel bar workers do it too fast, they will run into the carpenters; if they do it too slowly, they will cause trouble with the cement workers. Since they are a Youth Shock Brigade, their work efficiency is high, and there will never be any trouble with the cement workers. If there is, it will be running into the carpenters. Running into the carpenters did happen once. At the Third Construction Site, someone shouted: "Catch up!" The so-called catching up is catching up with the carpenters. Some people with pride would shout this. There would also be people who agree. That's how it happened. Also, because from the foundation to the third floor, they got used to laying it, it was easy to catch up if they said catch up. The carpenter masters could not speed up when nailing nails, but they—these steel bar workers could pile all the steel bars at the carpenters' feet. A large pile of steel bars, in the way, this hindered the work of the carpenters. It was really running into the carpenters. The carpenter masters ignored them, and the next day they jumped to the front to work, leaving a large section behind, empty. Zhang Baifa went to ask the carpenter master: "What's going on?" "What did you say?" "This, there is an empty section, we are just staring blankly." The master didn't say anything else, only said: "The design has changed!" Zhang Baifa also got angry: "I'm going to find the construction site director." But Zhang Baifa didn't go far when he heard laughter behind him and a shout: "The phone just rang, saying it hasn't changed again!" Zhang Baifa knew he was in the wrong, so he didn't go to find the construction site director, but went directly to the Youth League branch. As a result, he was criticized for only caring about himself and not caring about the collective. Zhang Baifa returned to convene a review meeting, and he opened the door and said: "Because of time, let's focus on reviewing..." He said the beginning, and Wang Zhiyi said: "Okay, I'll do it." Zhang Baifa had his own idea and didn't let him continue: "No, I'll come first..." He continued, talking about himself, talking about everyone. He advocated going to apologize to the carpenter masters. Xiao Deng blew up again when he heard this, saying: "Apologize to who? Apologize to them. Humph! Nice thought, it's more likely that they will apologize to me." Zhang Baifa knew that there were Youth League members supporting him, and immediately replied: "Don't think this is a small matter, it affects our team, and it will also affect the entire work area. We young people work ahead, and admit mistakes behind? If we are wrong, we must admit it, this is the characteristic of young people." They selected a representative to go to the master carpenters. Zhang Baifa really has a spirit of self-criticism. He said to the master carpenters: "I grew up in the countryside, and in the countryside there is no disrespect for the 'elder family'. For us, not respecting the master carpenters here is also wrong." The master carpenters were originally more polite than them, and said to them: "Don't talk about what you are doing here, just look at such heavy rain! Besides, it takes two hands to clap!"
    The result of this matter was very good, the two types of work went from disunity to unity. Only Xiao Deng didn't go, and sulked for several days in a row. Zhang Baifa knew what was going on, so after that, no matter what kind of work was assigned, he assigned Xiao Deng to the back, because there were carpenters in front!
    In early September, the Youth Shock Brigade was transferred from the Second Construction Site to the Sixth Construction Site. Once, they worked continuously for three days and four nights, catching up on the progress of one day. This was their gift to National Day, and also created conditions for the cement workers, so that they could pour cement and take advantage of the holiday to maintain the cement. In this blitzkrieg-like action, a very interesting thing happened. That Xiao Deng once fell asleep and missed an entire shift. He is just such a person, he has shortcomings, but he always does a good job; therefore, no one criticized him. He was angry again, this time at himself. Since then, he has changed. Just as Zhang Baifa was about to insert a steel bar into the basement wall, Xiao Deng silently walked over, grabbed the steel bar and was about to go down. The steel bar was easy to insert, but the entrance was too small. Zhang Baifa said: "If you want to go down, I'll get you work clothes." Xiao Deng still had that look: "Afraid of getting dirty, still working." Zhang Baifa said again: "Even if you go down, it should be me, I am smaller than you, it is easier to go down." "You watch!" As a result, he went down smoothly. Zhang Baifa finally figured out his temper, he needs both criticism and encouragement, and one is indispensable. So when they added people and formed the fifth mutual aid group, Zhang Baifa announced in front of all the team members: "We have a total of five mutual aid groups, initially three, then four, now five. Now I announce that Xiao Deng is the leader of the first mutual aid group..." Xiao Deng was happy when he heard the first, but he quickly said: "How am I the first..." Zhang Baifa glanced at him and continued: "You are the first, Xiao Liu is the second..." Xiao Deng interrupted the captain again: "It's not okay for me to be the first..." Zhang Baifa suddenly asked: "Then what number are you?" Xiao Deng shrank his neck, choked for a moment, and said: "I... I'm the last..." "You're the last, but you're still a group leader!" Others knew Xiao Deng's intention and laughed. He also laughed along.
    Then there was winter construction. When it started in September, the ground of the Third Construction Site had just been cleared of grass, but by December, the steel bars had been tied to the seventh floor. Staying on top to work, the wind would blow people down. The company issued thread gloves and cotton gloves. The whole team put forward the slogan of a decisive battle against the cold. Not a single team member said it was cold. As soon as someone said the word cold, someone would immediately ask: "Have you worked?" That person would have nothing to say. Because everyone understood what "cold freezes lazy people" meant. In the end, they were rated as the winning team in the decisive battle against the cold.
    Winter is also the season for carrying out cultural and recreational activities. But the cultural and recreational cadre Xiao Liu, has been particularly inactive recently. Everyone knew that he was a middle school student and always had ideological problems. After the New Year, the truth was revealed, and he proposed to the captain to transfer out of the team. Asked him what the reason was, he stammered that his physical strength was not good. Zhang Baifa thought about it back and forth: Li Kaixian was also uneasy, if Xiao Liu left, wouldn't Li Kaixian also want to leave? But Zhang Baifa agreed to him, saying: "If you want to leave, we can't keep you; but let's have a meeting before you leave! You can also give us some suggestions." It just happened that the whole team was moving, and Xiao Liu was left alone. The whole team came back for a meeting in the evening. The meeting was attended by comrades sent by the leaders, as well as a white iron worker master and iron bar workers from other groups. Before the meeting, the song "Young People, Ardent Hearts" was sung. Zhang Baifa made a self-criticism, and Xiao Liu also made a self-criticism. Finally, Zhang Baifa also gave Xiao Liu some suggestions. He said very fairly that Xiao Liu had achievements in his work, but also had serious shortcomings, so he had to raise a question: "Is it because your physical strength is not good, or is it because my leadership is not good? If you say that I lead well, you would naturally not ask to transfer out of the team." Someone then said: "It is a great shame for a young person to ask to transfer out of the Youth Shock Brigade." Xiao Liu still wanted to defend himself, saying: "If I transfer to another place, I can also play a young role!" Someone immediately asked him: "So, it's not that your physical strength can't keep up, but that you have an opinion on the captain!" "Say there is, then there is! I can't get enough training here..." At this time, Li Kaixian opened fire, pointing at Xiao Liu's nose and saying: "The captain educates you, helps you, and you only joined the Youth League, and you still say there is not enough training. Then what should I say?" It turned out that he had not yet joined the Youth League. Then someone revealed Xiao Liu's thoughts, saying that he wanted to transfer to another place to be a captain. Xiao Liu's face was red and white, and he lowered his head and did not speak. A white iron worker master sighed and said: "Oh! You really don't know how we view young people. I am happy when I see you, singing every night; when I hear you sing, I think it would be great if I could join the team!" Everyone applauded, and Xiao Liu cried at some point. Tears fell one by one. He slowly stood up and said: "I used to say that there was not enough training, now I know that I have failed the Youth League's training, as long as... I won't..." Everyone shouted "Welcome back to the team." Zhang Baifa said: "We came back to the meeting to pick you up." The meeting ended like this. Everyone sang the song "Unity is Strength", needless to say, it was still Xiao Liu who was keeping time. He stood on the bench, his eyes a little astringent; but he also sang himself, and later laughed. When he jumped down from the bench, all the team members surrounded him.
    The cultural and recreational life of the Youth Shock Brigade only really began at this time. Whenever there was a get-together, Xiao Liu was always the commander-in-chief. There were three team members who could play the harmonica, and two who could play the erhu. Zhang Baifa loved to play the erhu, and Xiao Liu loved to sing. When the two were paired together, they would either sing "Liu Qiaoer" or "Borrowing the East Wind." Now they sleep next to each other. Because Zhang Baifa often writes challenge letters and the like, Xiao Liu helps him. Xiao Liu himself said that he was the captain's secretary. This was his intentional humility, in fact, he was Zhang Baifa's cultural teacher.
    The Youth Shock Brigade has long had a modest and simple style. This time, in the frugality campaign, from March to May this year, they saved 4,200 kilograms of materials. Zhang Baifa always emphasized that this was everyone's achievement. In fact, he once went to Yang Fulin's house and saw a fire poker, saying it cost 58 cents. He came back and said to everyone: "A fire poker is worth 58 cents, how much is a steel bar worth!" This was indeed an enlightening conversation, and the frugality campaign only began to develop in depth from this time.
    Then the captain went abroad...
    In July, another temporary task came. Deputy Captain Yang Fulin, like Zhang Baifa, is also a person who can boldly accept tasks. They transferred to the Second Company. Unexpectedly, at the beginning, they started a sanitation campaign. This was because after they went, there was no place to live. The labor section prepared to vacate a building for them to live in. They were unwilling to squeeze others out and then live in it themselves, that was unacceptable. They questioned: "Why don't you let us live in the tents propped up in the yard?" The tents were surrounded by grass and garbage; when it rained, the tents leaked, and when it was hot, they were like a steamer. Originally, no one wanted to live there, but they lived there. The union group leader Meng Zhaodiao immediately mobilized everyone to clean the yard, and also motivated the entire residential area. While everyone was cleaning, they asked: "Where did you come from?" They replied: Youth Shock Brigade. There are enough Youth Shock Brigades in Beijing, there is nothing strange about it. Then the task list came down, 32 tons of steel bars, just the proportioning of materials. The quota was 115 work days. As a result of their discussion, the control plan was 70 work days, and they strived to complete it in 50 work days. When they left, the Youth League branch instructed that they must strictly abide by the operating procedures and not allow rework. Because not only was there frequent rework here, but they often did not reach the quota. The first day's achievement report was submitted, and the labor section had never seen such high work efficiency, and it immediately caused a sensation. Some workers even ran to ask: "Who is your captain?" They replied: "Yang Fulin!" The workers listened and shook their heads, not knowing where this team came from. The next day, the labor section convened a technical exchange meeting, and the whole company realized that it was originally the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade.
    The next day, the third day, were the hottest days in Beijing this year. The numbers of the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade completing the task were like racing against the temperature, and they were getting higher day by day. Several team members couldn't even eat after finishing work. The company sent someone to call them to move the house, but they still didn't move. Thinking that since they had already lived there, it would be so bad to move again. The company sent someone to ask again the second time: "Do you have any sick people, who is it?" They still answered: "No. Just didn't eat; will be fine after eating." They seemed to be on the front line, and didn't leave the front line even when they were sick. Because they felt that if they couldn't even withstand this little difficulty, the captain would not be honored abroad!

专栏：在社会主义建设事业中的青年积极分子

    张百发钢筋工青年突击队
    雷加
    在张百发青年突击队里，劳动纪律很严格，而且是大家自愿遵守的，不带一点勉强。他们保证了出勤率百分之九十九点几。
    也许有人以为他们建队以来就如此，其实不是的。下面一件小事，可以说明一切。
    有一次工地的警卫同志向队长张百发提出了一个意见：“你们整天拿着拧钩子绑扎钢筋。可是，这是为什么呢？偏偏自己的符号不戴在胸前……”张百发的符号是天天戴在胸前的，警卫同志的话自然是指队里的人了。如果是别人，他会挑剔一下，别的队也有不戴的；或者自己以身作则就对了。既然队长自己戴着符号，再翘翘指头对队员说说：“看呀！我的符号戴在胸前，你们也要……”甚至厉害一点，加上一句：“自觉嘛！同志们！”可是张百发并不如此。他有另一套做法。第二天早上，张百发队的符号全戴在胸前了。仔细看看，别符号的别针都是新的，是张百发从合作社买来的。队员们没有说第二句话，全用别针别上自己的符号。一面别着一面引起了自豪的情绪：“我们是青年突击队嘛！小事上也不能含糊！”
    张百发队是赶进度的能手。他们每次都超过百分之三十以上完成了任务。从他们最初订的数字到现在的数字，好像是爬山一样。他们一步步爬上去，一点也不觉得什么；可是站在山下的人，望见他们站在高峰上，心中总是又敬佩，又惊奇。
    张百发队的光荣，主要表现在接受任务上。张百发的特点是大胆接受任务；当然，最初也并非如此。头一个任务，他是硬着头皮答应的，第二个任务是冒着胆应承的。以后他明白了，凡是艰巨的、困难的、需要带头的、限期完成的任务，不交给青年突击队去干，交给谁呢？有时上级先是同他商量，张百发就说：“我们青年突击队嘛！应该……一定……”上级又问有困难没有？他又说：“有困难，我们自己克服！青年突击队嘛！”他记得头两次，这些话本来是上级说的，还带着鼓励的口吻：“你们青年突击队嘛！应该……一定……”“有困难，你们自己克服。青年突击队嘛！”
    可是最初，在部分队员的眼里，他的这个特点不算什么特点，而是最大的缺点。
    原来建队那年，队长才十九岁。多数队员的年龄都比他大一点，手艺也比他强一点。他只有一点织布手艺，不久才转到建筑业来的。依照队员的说法，他不过是个头发钩钩巴巴的年轻娃娃，什么特点也没有。一开头他就把挖下水道的活揽过来，有些队员认为这是最不该的。可是他们哪里知道，张百发在建队时就受到了重大的考验呢！这个青年突击队的成立，是张百发从市委团校回来后提出的。他说：“建筑苏联展览馆有青年突击队，我们为什么不该有？”上级认为这个意见很好，但需要慎重。“要建立就得像个样子，可不能半路垮了。”当时张百发回答说：“有党和团的领导和教育，怎么能垮？”就这样，青年突击队成立了。既然建队了，任务就下来了。他接受任务也不是没有讲过价钱。当上级给他们挖下水道任务时，他借口都是钢筋工，挖下水道二点五公尺的定额好像太高。他明明白白的意思是要干钢筋活。当时没有钢筋活。团总支的同志对他说：“干去吧！有团的领导和帮助，一定能完成。”这正是他建队时讲过的话。他听了这话，赶快答应下来。
    张百发先同队里的青年团员开了个会。他们都支持他。有人说，挖下水道是力气活，卖点力气就能突破定额。一致通过控制计划二点八公尺，还要争取达到三公尺。他们在开工典礼大会上，就把这个数字提出来，得到了热烈的欢迎。头一天就干得不错，挖了七公尺。有人问这七公尺是怎么挖的？大家那时还不大会总结经验，瞧瞧手上的水泡，心想：除了热情，还有什么呢？第二天，又挖了七公尺，差不多天天都得把保证书要回来修改数字。那时同青年突击队一块干的，还有瓦工队。瓦工们在大会上听见这群娃娃提出二点八公尺，有人暗自笑了笑说：“两点八公尺，三公尺，也值得到台上叨咕叨咕！”后来听说挖了七公尺，这时又说：“亏你们年轻，现在有一手；可是挖下去，出了水，保你一公尺也挖不到。”五公尺深的沟，挖两公尺有姜石，挖四公尺遇到流沙，再挖下去就是地下水……的确够困难。
    可是数字还在提高。他们队里有一个队员叫任福丑。张百发同他谈过话，鼓励他争取入团。任福丑提出保证出勤率百分之百。他的手上磨起了四、五个大水泡，不肯休息。他说这算得了什么，比黄继光差得远呢！还有一个赵寿生，干起活来赛老虎，可是数他最小，大家都爱惜他。他扭了腰，队长不分配他工作，他死不回去，站在沟边清理土，还一趟一趟地给队员打开水喝。
    还有一个叫曹胜有的，身大力壮，只是不爱说话。他刚入队就不安心。这有个原因：全队十二人中，有八个是从前就互相认识的，他和另外三人都是从别处调来的，所以他老是觉得蹩扭；可是他不责备自己不合群，反怨别人孤立他。他心里想：“趁早走开，别叫他们欺侮乡下人。”有一天，他跑到在“北医”工地工作的熟人那里，把这些事一五一十地说了。这个熟人叫张振钢，听了他的话，咂咂嘴说：“你还说你是乡下人呢？谁是老实人也看不出来。张百发过去是我的徒弟，我知道。你说他年轻，我看过不少年轻人，但像他那样心眼老实的年轻人还不多。”这样，他回去以后，什么也没说，一心一意地干起活来了。
    这一段工程完了，又分配了一段工程：挖臭水沟。张百发早就盘算着这个任务落在自己手里不好办，可是偏偏就落在自己手里了。他对张师傅说：“任务，弄错了吧！”他这样说也挺对，如果有钢筋活，他们早该干钢筋活了。可是张师傅一点不含糊地说：“这活，你们不做，谁做？你们全是小伙子呀！又是青年突击队呀！别说啦！”张百发也连忙说：“别说啦！”任务就算定下来了。
    这些日子，大家都摸熟了体性。只有一个叫小邓的小伙子，大家摸不准他哪来的那么大的脾气，碰着谁就同谁碰，真是名符其实的“炸胆”。他和小刘在别的工地都做过组长，张百发耽心的就是他。果然，他炸开了。他指着张百发说：“这任务，你也接。”听他的口气，要是他早就给顶回去了。张百发仍然沉住气做解释工作：“我也说不该做；可是我们不做，谁做？”“我们”这两个字拖得挺长。不难明白，既是青年突击队，困难的活不轮到我们做，谁做。小邓听他一说，就更炸了：“哼！这二十几天，刚做出点成绩，你又接受了这样的任务，这回达不到定额够多难看。”他倒是为了青年突击队的名誉，理由也挺充足。所以他说完了，放下脸来，再不肯收起。有人提出缓和的意见说：“怕完不成，降低定额行不行？”原来领导上也有这个意思：既然困难，可以降低定额。可是那个曹胜有——就是从“北医”回来以后就老老实实地干活的那个人说话了。说实在的，谁也记不起他上一句话是什么时候讲的。这时他说：“不好挖，也不能降低定额，我……不，咱们不能出个主意？……”他的声音不大，也不特别；但是他出的主意很好。他提倡用吊斗往上运土，不但比用锹扔土强得多，而且解决了沟深、土扔不上去又顺着锹把子回来的问题。凭着这个吊斗，他们又超额完成了任务。工区为了防止臭气，发了口罩，医务室又发了棉花和药水。药水真灵，先把鼻子熏“聋”了，什么也闻不到。但是，主要的还是全体队员为了给“五一”献礼，才把定额提到十四公尺，超额百分之二百五十。
    “五一”以后，他们接受了本工种的任务：为三工地的大楼绑扎钢筋。他们一共扎了一百零八吨，超额百分之三十以上完成任务。
    在这里出了一件事。
    按工序讲，木工在前面制木盒子，钢筋工铺钢筋，绑扎，然后是浇灌水泥。钢筋工做快了，会同木工顶头；做慢了，又会同水泥工闹事。既是青年突击队，工作效率高，同水泥工闹事是决不会有的。要有，也是同木工顶头。顶头的事，确有这么一回。他们在三工地，有人喊了一句：“追上去！”所谓追上去，就是追木工。有些骄傲情绪的人是会这么喊的。附合的人也会有的。事情就是这么发生的。另外也是因为从基础铺到三层，铺顺了手，说追上去，很容易就追上去了。木工师傅钉钉子不能超速度，他们——这些钢筋工可把钢筋全堆在木工的脚底下了。钢筋一大堆，绊手绊脚，这就妨碍了木工的工作。真是顶头了。木工师傅理也不理，第二天竟跳到前面工作去了，后面剩下一大截，空着。张百发走去问木工师傅：“咋回事呀？”“你说什么？”“这，空着一截子，叫我们干瞪眼。”老师傅也不说别的话，只说：“设计变更啦！”张百发也发了火：“我去找工地主任。”可是张百发走了不远，听见后面一面唏啦哗啦地笑着，一面喊：“刚才来电话，说又不变啦！”张百发知道自己理亏，没有去找工地主任，直接到团总支去了。结果受了批评，说他们只顾自己，不顾集体。张百发回来召开检讨会，他开门见山地说：“因为时间关系，咱们重点检讨……”他说了个头，王志义就说：“好，我来。”张百发有自己的主意，不让他说下去：“别，我先来……”他接着说下去，说到自己，说到大家。他主张去给木工师傅赔礼。小邓一听又炸啦，说：“给谁？给他们。哼！想得不错，叫他们给我赔礼还不大离。”张百发知道有团员支持自己，立刻回答说：“别以为这是小事，它影响咱们队，还要影响整个工区。咱们青年人干活在前头，承认错误在后头吗？错了就要承认，这是青年人的特点。”他们推出代表，到老师傅那里去了。张百发真有一种自我检讨的精神。他对老师傅说：“我是农村长大的，在农村没有不尊敬‘老家’的。对我们来说，在这里不尊敬老师傅也是不对的。”老师傅原来比他们还客气，对他们说：“先别说你们干什么来啦，只瞧瞧这么大的雨吧！再说，一个巴掌也拍不响呀！”
    这件事的结果是很好的，两个工种由不团结而团结了。只有小邓没有去，并且一连好几天生闷气。张百发心中有底，以后不论分配什么活，都把小邓分配在后面，因为前头有木工呀！
    九月初，青年突击队由二工地调到六工地。有一次，他们连续干了三天四夜，多赶出了一天的进度。这是他们给国庆节的献礼，同时也给水泥工创造了条件，既能灌上水泥，又能利用假期养护水泥。在这次突击性的行动中，发生了一件很有意思的事情。那个小邓有一回睡迷糊了，整整脱了一班。他就是这样一个人，缺点是有，活总是干得很好；因此，大家一句也没有批评他。他又生气了，这次可是对自己。从此，他改变了。正好张百发要往地下室墙里插一根钢筋，小邓不声不响地走过来，抢过钢筋就要下去。钢筋好插，可是入口太小。张百发说：“你要下去，我去给你取工作服。”小邓还是那种神气：“怕脏，还干活。”张百发又说：“就是下去，也该着我，我的个子比你小，容易下。”“你看着吧！”结果他顺顺当当地下去了。张百发总算摸到他的脾气了，又要批评，又要鼓励，缺一样也不行。所以当他们因为添了人，成立第五个互助组的时候，张百发在全体队员面前宣布说：“我们一共五个互助组，最初是三个，后来四个，现在五个。现在我宣布小邓是第一互助组长……”小邓听说第一，心里高兴；可是又急着说：“怎么我是第一……”张百发望了他一眼，仍然说下去：“你就是第一，小刘第二……”小邓又打断队长的话：“我来第一，可不行……”张百发突然问：“那么你第几？”小邓缩缩脖子，噎了一下，说：“我……我第末……”“你第末，也还是个组长嘛！”别人知道小邓的心意，都笑了。他也跟着笑了。
    接着是冬季施工。九月开始的时候，三工地的地上刚刚刨去了草，但是到十二月，钢筋已经绑到第七层了。呆在上面工作，风会把人刮下来。公司发了线手套和棉手套。全队提出抗寒决战的口号。没有一个队员说冷。只要说个冷字，马上有人会问：“你干活了没有？”那人便没话说了。因为他们每个人都懂得“寒冷冻懒汉”是指着什么说的。最后他们被评为抗寒决战优胜队。
    冬季也是开展文娱活动的季节。可是文娱干事小刘，最近特别不积极。大家都知道他是一个中学生，老有思想问题。过了年才揭了底，他向队长提出要调队。问他什么原因，他支支吾吾地说是体力不好。张百发前前后后想了想：李开先也不安心，让小刘走了，李开先不是也要走吗？可是张百发答应了他，说：“你要走，咱也留不住；可是临走开个会吧！你也给我们提提意见。”正好全队搬家，单单把小刘留下，晚上全队又回来开会。参加会议的有上级派来的同志，也有白铁工老师傅和别的组的铁筋工。会前唱了“年青的人，火热的心”的歌子。张百发做了检讨，小刘也做了检讨。最后张百发又给小刘提了意见。他说得很公正，认为小刘工作有成绩，也有严重缺点，因此他不得不提出一个问题：“是你体力不好，还是我领导不好？如果说我领导得好，你自然不会要求调队了。”有人接着说：“一个青年人要求调出青年突击队，真是个大耻辱。”小刘还想辩解，他说：“调到别处，我也能起青年作用呀！”有人立即问他：“这么说，你不是体力顶不上，而是对队长有意见啦！”“说有就有吧！我在这里得不到培养……”这时李开先开炮了，指着小刘的鼻子说：“队长教育你，帮助你，你才入了团，还说培养不够。那我怎么说呢？”原来他还没有入团。接着就有人揭破了小刘的心思，说是他想调到别处当队长。小刘的脸上一阵红一阵白，低着头不说话。有个白铁工老师傅叹了口气说：“哎呀！你们实在不知道咱们对年轻人怎么看法。我看见你们就高兴，每天晚上唱呀唱的；听见你们唱，我就想我能入队才好呢！”大家鼓起掌来，不知什么时候小刘哭了。眼泪一颗一颗地掉下来。他慢慢地站起来说：“以前说培养不够，现在我知道辜负了团的培养，只要……我就不……”大家喊着“欢迎回队。”张百发说：“我们回来开会，也是回来接你的。”会就这样结束了。大家唱着“团结就是力量”的歌子，不用说，还是小刘打拍子。他站在凳子上，眼睛有些发涩；可是他自己也唱起来了，后来也笑了。他从凳子上跳下来的时候，全体队员围住了他。
    青年突击队的文化娱乐生活，这时才真正开始了。一搞联欢，小刘总是总指挥。队员里有三个会吹口琴的，两个会拉胡琴的。张百发就爱拉胡琴，小刘爱唱，两个人配在一起，不是唱“刘巧儿”，就是唱“借东风”。现在他俩睡觉也紧挨着。因为张百发常常写挑战书什么的，小刘便帮助他。小刘自己说是队长的秘书。这是他有意谦逊，实际上他倒是张百发的文化教员。
    青年突击队早就有了谦逊朴实的作风。这次搞节约运动，从今年三月到五月，他们节省了四千二百公斤材料。张百发每次都强调这是大家的成绩。实际上，他有一次到杨福林家里去，看见一根火筷子，说是五毛八分钱买的。他回来对大家说：“一根火筷子值五毛八分钱，一根钢筋值多少钱呵！”这确是有启发性的谈话，节约运动也是从这时才深入开展的。
    接着队长出国了……
    七月里，又来了临时任务。副队长杨福林和张百发一样，也是能够大胆接受任务的人。他们转到二公司了。想不到一开头，他们就来了个卫生运动。这是因为他们去了之后，没有地方住。劳动科准备腾大楼让给他们住。他们不愿意把别人挤出去，自己再住下，这是说不过去的。他们质问道：“院子里支着的帐篷，为什么不叫我们住呢？”帐篷的周围长着草，还有垃圾；下雨时帐篷漏水，天热时又像蒸笼一样。本来谁都不愿意住的，他们住下了。工会小组长孟昭雕立刻发动大家打扫院子，并且把整个住宅区都带动起来了。大家一面打扫，一面问：“你们是哪里来的？”他们回答说：青年突击队。北京市青年突击队够多的，没有什么奇怪的。接着任务单下来了，三十二吨钢筋，光是配料。定额是一百一十五个工，他们讨论的结果，控制计划七十个工，争取五十个工完成。临走时团总支指示，绝对遵守操作规程，不许返工。因为这里不但常常返工，而且常常达不到定额。第一天的成绩单报上去，劳动科从来没有看见过这么高的工作效率，立即轰动起来了。有的工人还跑去问：“你们队长是谁？”他们答：“杨福林！”工人听了听，摇摇头，不知这是哪里来的一个队。第二天，由劳动科召集了技术交流会，全公司才知道原来就是张百发青年突击队。
    第二天、第三天，就是今年北京最热的那几天。张百发青年突击队完成任务的数字像同气温比赛似的，也一天一天高上去。有好几个队员干完活，连饭也吃不下去。公司派人来叫搬房子，他们还是不搬。心想既住下了，再搬多么不好。第二次公司又派人来问：“你们有病号，是谁？”他们照样答：“没有。只是没吃饭；一吃饭就好了。”他们好像是在火线上，带病也不下火线。因为他们觉得，如果连这一点困难也顶不下来，队长在国外也不光荣呵！
