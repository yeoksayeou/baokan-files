Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 23rd (TASS dispatch): According to a report by the German News Agency, Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, received the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, which had returned from Moscow, on the 21st. Prime Minister Grotewohl, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, and Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, reported to President Pieck on the negotiation process and results between the government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union.

President Pieck expressed his gratitude for the detailed report by the government delegation. He said: The treaty between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is of true historical significance. This treaty opens a new stage for the development of the German Democratic Republic and its position in the world.

President Pieck continued: This treaty stipulates that the German Democratic Republic can freely resolve its internal and foreign policy issues, including its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. In the future, the free German workers' and peasants' state will do its utmost to safeguard European peace and achieve mutual understanding between Germans.

President Pieck spoke of the German people's desire for the swift conclusion of an all-German peace treaty. He emphasized that the ratification of the Paris Agreements obstructs the conclusion of such a treaty. Under these circumstances, only by establishing a collective security system to safeguard European peace can the all-German issue be resolved peacefully through consultation. The treaty concluded in Moscow truly contributes to safeguarding the cause of European peace, thereby promoting the cause of future reunification of Germany.

President Pieck fully agreed with the results of the Moscow talks.

    皮克接见从莫斯科回来的民主德国代表团
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：据德意志通讯社消息，德意志民主共和国总统皮克二十一日接见了从莫斯科返国的以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团。格罗提渥总理，努舍克副总理和德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希向皮克总统汇报了德意志民主共和国和苏联两国政府代表团的谈判过程和谈判结果。
    皮克总统对政府代表团人员的详细的报告表示感谢。他说：德意志民主共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟关系条约具有真正的历史意义。这个条约为德意志民主共和国的发展和它在世界上的地位开辟了新的阶段。
    皮克总统接着说：这个条约规定了德意志民主共和国可以自由地解决它的内政和外交政策的问题，包括同德意志联邦共和国的关系在内。今后自由的德意志工农国家将竭尽全力保障欧洲和平和达成德国人之间的互相谅解。
    皮克总统谈到德国人民渴望迅速地缔结全德和约。他着重指出：巴黎协定的批准阻挠了这种条约的缔结。在这种情况下，只有在通过建立集体安全体系以保障欧洲和平的条件下，才能和平协商解决全德问题。莫斯科缔结的条约真正有助于保障欧洲和平事业，从而促进今后重新统一德国的事业。
    皮克总统完全同意莫斯科谈判的结果。
