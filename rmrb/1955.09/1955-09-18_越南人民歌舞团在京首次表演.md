Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: The Vietnam People's Song and Dance Troupe held its opening ceremony for its performance tour in China at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing on the evening of the 17th, performing twelve songs and dances with rich ethnic characteristics. Their performance was warmly welcomed by the Beijing audience.

The first program performed by the Vietnamese artists was a chorus. Vietnamese singers first sang the Chinese folk song "The East is Red" and "Ode to Ho Chi Minh," and then sang the song "Tao River Guerrillas," which reflected the Vietnamese people's national liberation struggle. The chorus also successfully sang the Chinese song "People of the World are of One Heart" in Chinese. This song was repeated once after three curtain calls.

The performance song "Pulling the Cannon," which was sung at the evening party, was a work that won an award at the 1954 Vietnam National Music and Drama Festival. Vietnamese singers play a group of Vietnamese People's Army soldiers, pulling cannons over steep mountains in the chorus to participate in the battle to liberate Dien Bien Phu, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese People's Army in overcoming difficulties. "Bamboo Grove Carnival Dance" is adapted from folk dances of the Muong and Thai ethnic groups in northwestern Vietnam. It depicts the carnival scene of the Vietnamese army and people after the victory of the war. The performers dance lightly, jumping over bamboo poles that are clapped against each other on the ground.

The Vietnamese folk dance "Production Joy Dance" shows the happy working life of Vietnamese farmers after the land reform. Six female dancers performed agricultural labor scenes such as plowing and sowing in the form of dance, and finally performed the happy mood of farmers when they tasted the harvested grain.

The audience warmly welcomed the male and female duet "Spring Outing" performed by the Vietnamese artists. This program is full of life. It depicts a group of rural young men and women meeting under a banyan tree in the field, singing to each other and agreeing to go to the market. The performers vividly portray the mutual love of young men and women and the shyness of girls.

In the female chorus, a beautiful Vietnamese folk song "Twisting Thread and Threading Needle" was sung, and the Chinese song "Long Live Mao Zedong" was re-sung for the audience. The four Vietnamese folk songs sung by female soloists and "Remembering Hometown," sung in the form of Vietnamese ancient poem recitation, all showed the beautiful Vietnamese national style in the melody of the song and the form of performance.

At the opening ceremony before the performance, Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the literary and art circles of the capital, and congratulated the song and dance troupe on its successful performance. Liu Zhonglu, head of the song and dance troupe, delivered a reply.

After the performance, Zheng Zhenduo and Xia Yan, Vice Ministers of Culture, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and others met with Vietnamese artists in the backstage to express their congratulations and condolences. (Attached picture)

    越南人民歌舞团在京首次表演
    新华社十七日讯  越南人民歌舞团十七日晚在北京天桥剧场举行在中国访问演出的开幕式，演出了十二个富有民族特色的歌舞节目。他们的表演受到北京观众的热烈欢迎。
    越南艺术家表演的第一个节目是合唱。越南歌唱家首先演唱了中国民歌“东方红”和“歌颂胡志明”，又演唱了反映越南人民的民族解放斗争的歌曲“滔河游击队”。合唱队还成功地用中国话演唱了中国歌曲“全世界人民心一条”。这支歌在三次谢幕后又重唱了一次。
    晚会上演唱的表演歌曲“拉炮歌”，是曾经在一九五四年越南全国音乐、戏剧会演时获奖的作品。越南歌唱家扮演着一群越南人民军战士，在合唱声中把大炮拉过险峻的高山去参加解放奠边府的战斗，表现了越南人民军队战胜困难的英雄气概。“竹丛联欢舞”是根据越南西北地区芒族和泰族的民间舞改编的，它描写了越南军民在战争胜利后的联欢情景。表演者跳越过在地上互相拍击作声的竹杆间轻盈地舞蹈。
    越南民间舞蹈“生产欢乐舞”表现了越南农民在土地改革后幸福的劳动生活。六位女舞蹈家以舞蹈形式表演了犁田、播种等农业劳动的情景，最后又表演了农民在尝到丰收的谷物时的愉快心情。
    观众们热烈欢迎越南艺术家表演的男女对唱“春游”。这个节目充满生活的气息，它描写一群农村男女青年在田野中的榕树下相遇，互相对唱相约去赶集。表演者生动地刻划出青年男女的互相爱慕和少女的羞涩神情。
    在表演的女声小合唱中演唱了一支曲调优美的越南民歌“捻线穿针”，并为观众重唱了中国歌曲“万岁毛泽东”。女声独唱家演唱的四支越南民歌和以越南古诗朗诵式演唱的“忆故乡”，在歌的曲调及表演的形式上，都表现了越南优美的民族风格。
    在演出前的开幕式上，文化部副部长夏衍代表中华人民共和国文化部和首都文艺界致欢迎词，并且祝贺歌舞团演出成功。歌舞团团长刘仲卢致答词。
    在演出结束以后，文化部副部长郑振铎、夏衍，外交部副部长章汉夫等一同到后台会见越南艺术家，向他们表示祝贺和慰问。（附图片）
