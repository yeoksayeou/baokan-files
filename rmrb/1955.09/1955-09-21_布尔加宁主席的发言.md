Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 19th (TASS): The full text of Bulganin's speech at the negotiations between the Soviet and German Democratic Republic government delegations on September 19th is as follows:

    I think we should first thank the members of the committee who drafted such an important document as the "Treaty on Relations Between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the German Democratic Republic" for us today. This treaty marks a new historical stage in the development of relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the German Democratic Republic.
    The Soviet government fully agrees with the draft treaty.
    Today we are very pleased to hear the speeches of the German Democratic Republic delegation members - Comrade Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister, Comrade Nuschke, Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union and Deputy Prime Minister, Comrade Ross, General Secretary of the Democratic Peasants' Party, Comrade Bolz, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, and Professor Correns, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany. We fully agree with the opinions they expressed. We attach particular importance to the draft "Treaty on Relations Between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the German Democratic Republic" submitted to us. There is no doubt that this treaty will help our two countries further develop close cooperation and strengthen friendly relations on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and non-interference in internal affairs. This treaty takes into account the new situation that has formed after the entry into force of the Paris Agreements of 1954.
    It is particularly gratifying that the purpose of this treaty is to enable the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to work together to promote the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security in Europe. It will help to reunify Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. This treaty is in the interests of the people of both the Soviet Union and Germany, and equally in the interests of the people of other European countries.
    We reiterate that the relations between our two countries are built on the basis of mutual respect and full equality. According to this treaty, as everyone has said here, the German Democratic Republic can freely decide on its own domestic and foreign policies, including its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and the development of relations with all other countries. In view of this, the Soviet government has considered whether it is no longer appropriate to continue to retain the position of Soviet High Commissioner in Germany. The Soviet government has also considered the decrees, instructions, orders and other resolutions issued by the Allied Control Council for Germany between 1945 and 1948, and has adopted a decision. I would like to inform the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, you, Comrade Prime Minister, of this decision.
    The Soviet government believes that it is appropriate to abolish the post of Soviet High Commissioner in Germany and to authorize the Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic to maintain appropriate contact with the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom and France in the Federal Republic of Germany on issues related to Germany as a whole in accordance with the relevant decisions of the four powers.
    In view of the fact that the German Democratic Republic has implemented the decisions of the Allied Control Council for Germany on the reconstruction of social life on a peaceful and democratic basis, and taking into account that the existing laws of the German Democratic Republic make it unnecessary to maintain the validity of the aforementioned decisions, the Soviet government believes that it is appropriate to stipulate that the relevant laws, instructions, orders and other resolutions issued by the Allied Control Council for Germany between 1945 and 1948 shall cease to be effective in the territory of the German Democratic Republic.
    Comrade Prime Minister, Comrade members of the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic, today's meeting is undoubtedly a historic meeting. This meeting will be recorded in the annals of the relations between our two countries. As everyone knows, historical events do not always receive due evaluation immediately. Contemporary people sometimes seem to think that all this is ordinary, that all this is part of our daily life.
    However, I believe that what the representatives of your delegation have said so well here today, and what has been written in the treaty between our two countries, goes beyond the scope of our current concepts. Everything that happened during our negotiations and the documents we signed will be recorded in the annals of the relations between our two countries, that is, the relations between two countries where the people, workers, peasants and working intellectuals hold state power, and will become an example of how the people composed of workers, peasants and working intellectuals should arrange their national relations - a relationship based on selfless friendship, with the prosperity and peaceful life of all nations as the sole goal.
    Finally, let me express my belief that all the agreements we have reached in the negotiations will be in the interests of the people of Germany and the Soviet Union, and also in the interests of the people of other European countries.

    布尔加宁主席的发言
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：布尔加宁九月十九日在苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团谈判时的发言全文如下：
    我认为首先应当向今天为我们起草好了“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志民主共和国关系条约”草案这样一个重要文件的委员会的委员们表示感谢。这个条约标志着苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志民主共和国之间的关系发展中的一个新的历史阶段。
    苏联政府完全同意条约草案。
    我们今天在这里非常满意地听到了德意志民主共和国代表团人员——德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、副总理乌布利希同志，基督教民主联盟主席、副总理努舍克同志，民主农民党总书记罗斯同志，德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部长、国家民主党主席博尔茨同志和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团主席柯伦斯教授等人的发言。我们完全同意他们所表示的意见。我们特别重视提交给我们的“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志民主共和国关系条约”草案。毫无疑问，这个条约会有助于我们两国在互相尊重主权、平等和不干涉内政的基础上进一步发展密切合作和加强友好关系。这个条约是考虑到了一九五四年的巴黎协定生效后所形成的新局面的。
    特别令人高兴的是：这个条约的目的是使苏联和德意志民主共和国共同努力，以促进维护和巩固欧洲的国际和平和安全。它将有助于使德国重新统一成为爱好和平和民主的国家。这个条约符合苏、德两国人民的利益，也同样地符合欧洲其他国家人民的利益。
    我们重申：我们两国的关系是建筑在我们两国互相尊重和完全平等的基础之上的。根据这个条约，正如大家在这里讲过的，德意志民主共和国可以自由决定自己的国内政策和对外政策的问题，其中包括同德意志联邦共和国的相互关系以及发展同其他所有国家的关系的问题。有鉴于此，苏联政府考虑了继续保留苏联驻德高级专员这个职位是否已经不适宜的问题。苏联政府还考虑了对德管制委员会在一九四五到一九四八年期间所颁布的法令、指示、命令和其他决议的问题，并且通过了一项决定。我想把这个决定通知德意志民主共和国代表团，通知你，总理同志。
    苏联政府认为：撤销苏联驻德高级专员这个职位，并且授权苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使在根据四国的有关决定而发生的有关整个德国的问题上同美国、英国和法国驻德意志联邦共和国的代表保持相应联系，是适宜的。
    鉴于德意志民主共和国实现了对德管制委员会关于在和平和民主的基础上重建社会生活的决议，并且考虑到德意志民主共和国现有的法律使得上述决议没有必要再保持效力，苏联政府认为规定对德管制委员会在一九四五到一九四八年期间颁布的有关的法律、指令、命令和其他决议在德意志民主共和国领土上停止生效，是适宜的。
    总理同志，德意志民主共和国政府代表团团员同志们，今天我们的会议毫无疑问是一个历史性的会议。这次会议将载入我们两国关系的史册中。大家知道，历史事件并不是总能一下子就获得应有的估价的。当代的人有时候似乎以为所有这一切都是平常的，所有这一切都是我们日常生活的一部分。
    但是，我以为，你们代表团的代表们今天在这里讲得这样好的东西以及在我们两国间的条约上写下的东西，已经超出了我们今天的概念的范围。我们在谈判过程中所发生的一切以及我们所签署的文件，将载入我们两国的关系的史册中，即由人民、工人、农民和劳动知识分子掌握国家政权的两个国家的关系的史册中，而且会成为一个范例，说明由工人、农民和劳动知识分子组成的人民应当怎样安排自己的国家关系——一种以无私的友谊为基础的、以各国人民的繁荣和和平生活为唯一目标的关系。
    最后，请让我表示相信我们在谈判中所达成的一切协议会符合德国和苏联两国人民的利益，也符合欧洲其他国家的人民的利益。
