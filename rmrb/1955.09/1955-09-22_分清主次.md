    Distinguish Between Primary and Secondary Tasks
    Kong Sang
    Many factories and mines, in their work to oppose waste and practice thrift, are actively improving production management and raising technical levels, achieving remarkable results in both increasing production and saving resources. However, some enterprises have not grasped the important problems in production, failing to use their main efforts to solve these problems. For example, in the local state-owned Shenyang Acid-Resistant Materials Factory, the reject rate of acid-resistant bricks exceeds the state-stipulated 20 percent. The factory's leading staff members do not pay attention to solving this problem, but are instead enthusiastically organizing workers to pick up waste materials, believing that the greatest saving lies in dealing with "junk."
    Picking up waste materials and cleaning up warehouses are both necessary. But for the overall work of conservation, this is not a primary task, and certainly not the only task. The reason why a factory has so much waste material is nothing more than excessive waste in the production process and shortcomings in storage management. In order to save resources, getting to the root of the problem, the most fundamental issue is to improve product quality, reduce the reject rate, rationally use raw materials, and establish a strict material management system. Only in this way can we reduce and eliminate waste materials. In other words, only by earnestly improving production management and raising technology can we fundamentally overcome waste and achieve conservation. To replace the conservation work in industrial production with picking up waste materials and cleaning up warehouses is merely a superficial approach, neglecting the fundamental issues.
    Although the reasoning is so clear, why do the leaders of these units insist on adopting this superficial approach, neglecting the fundamental issues? Some hold a purely "task-oriented" view of conservation work, believing that as long as they complete the conservation figures required by the higher authorities, they do not need to care about the methods used. Of course, it cannot be said that these comrades truly understand the important significance of conservation and earnestly implement the spirit of conservation. Others, although they understand these principles, believe that solving production problems is difficult and troublesome, and some problems cannot be solved for the time being, so they have some fear of difficulty, and therefore only do what is easy and simple. This is also incorrect, of course. Since doing a good job in production is the fundamental aspect of conservation and the fundamental way to eliminate waste, what do difficulties and troubles matter? Can a leading staff member representing the state in managing an enterprise allow national wealth to be wasted forever for the sake of their own ease and convenience?
    Waste must be overcome. Difficulties and troubles are unavoidable. For the sake of building socialism, every enterprise manager and leading staff member should not fear difficulties or troubles!

    许多工厂矿山，在反对浪费、厉行节约的工作中，积极改进生产管理，提高技术水平，使增产和节约都收到显著成效；但是，也有一些企业，并没有抓紧生产中的重要问题，用主要力量去解决这些问题。例如地方国营沈阳耐酸材料厂，耐酸砖的废品率超过国家规定的百分之二十以上，这个厂的领导工作人员却不注意解决这方面的问题，只津津有味地组织职工拣废料，认为最大的节约就是处理“破烂”。
    拣废料、清理仓库，都是应该的；但对整个节约工作来说，这毕竟不是一个主要工作，尤其不是唯一的工作。一个工厂的废料所以多，不外是生产过程中浪费大和保管工作有缺点。为了节约，追本求源，最根本的问题是应该提高产品质量，降低废品率，合理地使用原材料，并建立严格的材料管理制度。只有这样，才能减少和消灭废料。换句话说，就是只有认真改善生产管理、提高技术，才能从根本上克服浪费，做到节约。那种以拣废料、清理仓库来代替工业生产中的节约工作，只不过是一种舍本逐末的做法。
    道理虽然这样明白，为什么这些单位的领导人员偏偏采取舍本逐末的办法呢？有的是由于对节约工作抱着单纯“任务”观点，认为只要完成上级所要求的节约数字就可以了，至于用什么办法就不必计较。对这些同志，当然不能说他们真正了解了节约的重要意义，认真贯彻了节约精神；有的虽然认识了这些道理，但是认为解决生产中的问题困难、麻烦，有些问题一时也解决不了，就有点畏难情绪，于是只拣轻松易作的去作。这当然也是不对的。因为既然搞好生产是节约的根本方面，是杜绝浪费的根本办法，困难一点，麻烦一点又算什么呢？难道一个代表国家管理企业的领导工作人员，可以为了自己的不困难、不麻烦，而让国家的财富永远浪费下去吗？
    浪费是必须克服的。困难和麻烦是不可避免的。为了建设社会主义，每一个企业管理人员和领导工作人员都不应该畏难怕麻烦！
