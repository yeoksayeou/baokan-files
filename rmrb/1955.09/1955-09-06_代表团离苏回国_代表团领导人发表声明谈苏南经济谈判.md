Xinhua News Agency, Kyiv, September 5th: According to TASS, the economic delegation of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, headed by Vukmanović-Tempo, Vice-Chairman of the Federal Executive Council of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, left Kyiv by plane on September 4th to return home after a two-week visit to the Soviet Union.
    Before departing, Vukmanović-Tempo issued a statement pointing out that the economic negotiations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union this time, like past negotiations, were conducted in a spirit of mutual understanding, and these negotiations have provided conditions for better and closer economic cooperation – and not just economic cooperation. In the course of the negotiations, we have obtained concrete and substantial results.
    Vukmanović-Tempo's statement also said: I am particularly pleased to point out that in the course of the negotiations, the Soviet Union did not put forward any proposals that were unacceptable to the Yugoslav economy or that might have an adverse effect on Yugoslavia's economic relations with other countries. On the contrary, the Soviet Union has given us large loans to assist us, which will enable us to solve our current economic problems more easily, and will also enable us to use more funds to formulate our long-term plans, especially to increase and further develop our agricultural production. In this way, the Soviet Union has also increased Yugoslavia's opportunities to improve its economic relations with other countries.
    Because of our contractual relations with the Soviet Union, we will be able to expand our foreign trade, and we will be able to make current payments more easily and carry out all other short-term trade and financial activities. Our contractual relationship can serve as an example of constructive cooperation between countries, which will lead to the consolidation of peace throughout the world.

    代表团离苏回国
    代表团领导人发表声明谈苏南经济谈判
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社基辅讯：以南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇—泰波为首的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国经济代表团在苏联作了两周访问以后，已经在九月四日乘飞机离基辅回国。
    在动身之前，伏克曼诺维奇—泰波发表声明指出，南斯拉夫这次和苏联举行的经济谈判和过去的谈判一样是在互相谅解的精神中进行的，这些谈判已为更好的和更密切的经济合作——而且不仅仅限于经济上的合作——提供了条件。在谈判的过程中，我们已经获得了具体的实质性的结果。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波的声明还说：我特别高兴指出，在谈判的过程中，苏联没有提出任何南斯拉夫经济所不能接受的、或者可能对南斯拉夫和其他国家之间的经济关系产生不良影响的建议。恰恰相反，苏联给我们大批贷款来援助我们，这些贷款将使我们能够比较容易地解决我们目前的经济问题，而且也使我们有可能用更多的资金来制定我们的长期计划，这特别指的是提高和进一步发展我们的农业生产。这一来，苏联也就增加了南斯拉夫改善它同其他国家的经济关系的机会。
    由于我们同苏联有了契约关系，我们将能扩大我们的对外贸易，而且我们将能够比较容易地作出目前的支付，并且能进行所有的其他短期贸易和金融活动。我们的契约关系可以作为国与国之间的建设性合作的范例，这种合作将导致全世界和平的巩固。
