Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 4th: Lao sources report: The eighth session of the Lao political conference was held on August 24th, under the firm demand of the Lao Fighting Units.

At the August 24th political conference, the Lao Fighting Units' representatives raised opinions regarding the two letters given to the Lao Fighting Units' political delegation on August 10th and 11th by the political delegation of the Lao Royal Government. In these two letters, the Royal Government disagreed with supplementing the election law to make it conform to the spirit of the Geneva Accords and also demanded that the Lao Fighting Units be disarmed and dissolved. The Lao Fighting Units pointed out that this proves the Royal Government still lacks sincerity in negotiations. The representatives of the Lao Fighting Units reaffirmed at the meeting that as long as the Royal Government guarantees the correct implementation of free national general elections with the participation of Lao resistance personnel, the issue of unifying the administrative institutions of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces into the Royal Government's authority will be easily resolved. The Lao Fighting Units' representatives also pointed out that the most necessary issue at present is that the Royal Government must stop its attacks on the two provinces and withdraw its unreasonable demand for the Lao Fighting Units to surrender. At this meeting, the Royal Government only agreed to accept one or two minor points in the Lao Fighting Units' suggestions; on fundamental issues, it still insisted on the position it expressed in the two letters of August 10th and 11th.

The ninth session of the Lao political conference was also held on August 26th, but this meeting also made no progress.

    老挝政治会议没有进展
    新华社河内四日电　老挝消息：在寮国战斗部队的坚决要求下，老挝政治会议的第八次会议已在八月二十四日举行。
    在八月二十四日的政治会议上，寮国战斗部队代表就老挝王国政府政治代表团在八月十日和十一日给寮国战斗部队政治代表团的两封信提出了意见。王国政府在这两封信中不同意对选举法予以补充以使它符合于日内瓦协定精神，而且还要求把寮国战斗部队解除武装并且加以解散。寮国战斗部队指出，这证明王国政府仍然没有谈判的诚意。寮国战斗部队代表在会上再次确认说，只要王国政府保证正确实现有寮国抗战人员参加的全国自由普选，那末，把桑怒和丰沙里两省的行政机构统一到王国政权中去的问题将是容易解决的。寮国战斗部队代表并且指出，目前最必要的问题是王国政府必须停止对两省的进攻，并且取消要寮国战斗部队投降的无理要求。在这次会议上，王国政府只同意接受寮国战斗部队建议中的一两点小节；而在根本问题上，仍然坚持它在八月十日和十一日两封信中所表明的立场。
    老挝政治会议的第九次会议也已经在八月二十六日举行，这次会议仍无进展。
