    The Traditional Friendship Between the Han People and the Various Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang
    Bai Shouyi
    The Han people and the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have a long history of traditional friendship. On the occasion of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, it is worthwhile to look back at the history of this traditional friendship.
    Since ancient times, residents of the Han areas have had contact with residents of Xinjiang. In ancient Chinese records, such as the "Yu Benji" which mentions the sweet spring and jade pool on Kunlun Mountain, and the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" and "Biography of Emperor Mu" which mention the Mountain of Jade in the West, may all be reflecting some beautiful legends about Xinjiang. From the end of the second century BC, the relationship between the two sides became significantly closer, with increasing people-to-people exchanges, trade of goods, and mutual influence of production knowledge and cultural life.
    In economic life, the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the Han people are very closely connected. Each side has greatly influenced the economic life of the other through its own economic activities. The Han people continuously transported their silk and silk products to Xinjiang, enriching the local raw materials for clothing and enriching the local commercial market. Persians and Romans enthusiastically welcomed this world-famous product, and they considered Xinjiang as the main market for obtaining this famous product. In the early second century AD, sericulture and silkworm rearing methods may have been introduced to the Hami area from the Han areas. Before the seventh century, Khotan became a center of sericulture in Xinjiang, and the people of Khotan were able to weave very good silk fabrics. "The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions" states that the people of Khotan established a silkworm deity temple and agreed not to "harm or kill silkworms, and only process the cocoons after the moths have flown away." This is of course a mystical view of silkworms, but it shows how the people of Khotan regarded sericulture as a major event in their lives at the time. The Han people have repeatedly gone to Xinjiang collectively for land reclamation, and together with the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, they have jointly developed the vast areas of the motherland's border. In the first century BC, the Han people began to engage in land reclamation in Xinjiang. From west of Dunhuang to the area around Luntai, many places along the transportation lines were being cultivated. The labor force in one place could reach several hundred people. After that, reclamation activities were carried out intermittently, and the extent of the reclaimed area was not fixed. By the end of the eighteenth century, the scale of reclamation was larger than before. At this time, the Han people had reclaimed more than 600,000 mu of land in Xinjiang. Of the reclaimed land, more than 550,000 mu were in northern Xinjiang. This was a large number for the land development in northern Xinjiang at that time. The reclamation by the Han people not only expanded the cultivated area and increased the total amount of agricultural production, but also inevitably brought the production technology and production experience of the Han areas. The development of agriculture and water conservancy in Xinjiang is related to the Han people. Sowing and digging canals were always closely linked to the Han people in the garrison farms. In canal construction projects, there was a type called well-canal, which involved digging channels underground and opening some vertical wells between the ground and the channels to facilitate the repair and dredging of the waterways. Well-canals were invented at the end of the second century BC, and the first application of the well-canal form was the Longshou Canal in Shaanxi Province (now submerged). Soon after, there were similar channels north of Dunhuang City. The Turpan area now has a very developed well-canal system, which is usually called "Karez". This is a huge project, and some have compared it to the Great Wall and the Grand Canal. This is of course a great achievement of the long-term labor of the people of Xinjiang, but the construction method of well-canals was introduced from the Han areas.
    In the first century BC, many places in Xinjiang already knew how to make ironware, but the output of ironware in Xinjiang was very lacking for a long time. Until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, iron pots and plowshares needed in Xinjiang still needed to be supplied by the Han areas. Between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the iron smelting industry in Shui Xigou, Fuyuan was quite developed. This was jointly operated by the Han people and local residents, and the iron produced could also be sold to Mongolia and Hexi.
    In the past long years, countless products were imported from the Han areas to Xinjiang to supply the needs of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. According to incomplete historical records, the main ones included tea, porcelain, pepper, dried ginger, granulated sugar, smoked plums, cinnamon, medicinal materials, pigments, tung oil, lacquer, alum, and summer cloth. Although Xinjiang already produced silk, silk floss, colored satin, and silk fabrics were often imported into Xinjiang from the Han areas.
    The various ethnic groups in Xinjiang also often transported their own products, and sometimes products from other places, to the Han areas. Historically, these included: horses, camels, fat-tailed sheep, yak tails, antelope horns, sable skins, jade, jade beads, amber, coral, cinnabar, magnetite, realgar, lacquer, Hu Tonglv, asafoetida, wolfberry, Picrorhiza scrophulariiflora, almond kernels, grapes, frankincense, benzoin, glass utensils, wool fabrics, copper utensils, and wooden combs, etc. Some of these were daily necessities, some were for food, medicine, and clothing, some were raw materials for crafts, and some were animal power for transportation. The scope was wide, involving many aspects of life. Because the Han people liked these things, the prices they gave were sometimes quite high. For example, in the early fifteenth century, one catty of grapes could be exchanged for one bolt of silk, and six fine wooden combs could also be exchanged for one bolt of silk. Although Xinjiang frequently imported silk fabrics and ironware from the Han areas, on the other hand, Xinjiang also produced special silk fabrics (such as silk, ramie silk, and brocade during the Song Dynasty) and special iron products (such as Damascus steel files, Damascus steel knives, and two-sided swords during the Song and Ming Dynasties) that were imported into the Han areas.
    The Xinjiang product that has the most important impact on the lives of the Han people is cotton. Cotton is a later name, and the "cotton" of cotton should be a rewriting of the "cotton" of silk cotton. Ancient names for cotton, apart from sometimes writing it as zhibei, jibei, and jiebei based on another etymology, generally wrote it as bodie, baidie, and baishe, etc., or simply as die, or writing die as die. This is exactly the name used by the Uyghurs to call cotton, and the Uyghurs still use this name. There was originally no cotton in the Han areas. The planting of cotton in the Han areas was due to the introduction of experience from both the southern ethnic minorities and the production experience from Xinjiang. As early as the early second century, people in Luoyang were already using cotton cloth from the West to make clothes. In the early third century, Emperor Wen of Wei, in his edict, said that cotton cloth from the Western Regions was whiter and more beautiful than other cloths. Some history books and travel notes from the sixth to thirteenth centuries (such as the Book of Liang, the Book of Sui, the Old and New Book of Tang, the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, the Record of Hyecho's Journey to the Five Indian Kingdoms, and the Travels of Marco Polo, etc.) all have records about cotton and cotton cloth in Xinjiang. In the mid-thirteenth century, Shaanxi began to plant cotton with seeds from the West, and promoted the experience gained to other places. The official book "Nongsang Jiyao" promulgated in the 1270s first introduced the methods of planting cotton and ginning cotton. In the early fourteenth century, the Uyghur Ruming Shan wrote "Nongsang Yishi Cuoyao" in Chinese, supplementing the methods of planting cotton. After about a hundred years, in the process of simultaneously promoting the experience of the South and Xinjiang, cotton planting and spinning were basically established throughout China. In terms of cotton spinning experience, the techniques of the southern ethnic minorities may have been more detailed, but the attention given to cotton from the beginning to the gradual formation of universal promotion after a long period of time cannot be said to be due to the influence of cotton production in Xinjiang.
    In terms of cultural life, Xinjiang had long used writing brushes for calligraphy and painting, used inkstones for ink, and used Chinese characters to write contracts. Xinjiang had also long introduced Chinese bamboo books, Chinese architectural forms, clothing forms, qin playing, and drum music. Xinjiang also translated Buddhist scriptures from Chinese, built Chinese-style Buddhist temples in major cities, and invited Chinese monks to be the abbots of the temples. The ancient relics preserved in Xinjiang also illustrate the import of painting from the Han areas, some of which maintained the independent style of Han works, and some of which had a mixed style of Han and Western elements. Closely related to cultural life, the great inventions of the Han people—papermaking and printing—were both introduced to Xinjiang one after another, and from there spread further west, eventually spreading to the world.
    Similarly, the Han people have also gained many things from the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang in terms of culture. Buddhism, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and Nestorianism were all first spread in Xinjiang before being spread in the Han areas. And regarding music and painting, the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have played a significant role in Han culture. At the end of the sixth century, after the Sui Dynasty had suffered losses during the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, it was no longer possible to inherit the traditional elegant musical tunes of the Han people. The basis for correcting the musical tunes at that time was the seven musical modes of the pipa of the Kuche musician Su Zhi Po, and therefore these seven modes had a great influence on the music of that time and later. The Sui Dynasty had nine musical departments, and the Tang Dynasty later increased it to ten. The Kucha (Qiuci) music, Shule music, and Turpan (Gaochang) music among the ten departments were all local music of Xinjiang, and the Western Liang music was in fact a variant of Kucha music. Kucha music, in particular, was extremely popular among the people. Famous musicians at the time, such as Bai Mingda and Li Ji, were from Kucha, and Pei Shenfu and Pei Xingnu were from Shule. The concave-convex painting method of Xinjiang was also introduced to the Han areas during the Tang Dynasty. Yuchi Yiseng, a Khotan man, was a master of concave-convex painting who lived in Chang'an. The great painter Wu Daozi also absorbed this painting method and made his works look brand new. Some people say that the "strange rocks and collapsing beaches in Wu Daozi's paintings can be touched and measured," which precisely describes the characteristic of this painting method in enhancing the sense of three-dimensionality. The ancient cave temple art of Xinjiang also had a great influence on the art of the Han areas. Many existing cave temples in the Han areas, in terms of murals, sculptures, and cave temple structure, have a relationship of succession with many cave temples in Xinjiang.
    The facts mentioned above, although described very briefly, can already illustrate the close relationship between the Han people and the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang in economic and cultural life.
    The political connections between the Han people and the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have also been close. Precisely because the interests of the Han people and the people of Xinjiang are closely intertwined in politics, the unification of the Han areas in history often helped to stabilize the social order in Xinjiang, and the disturbances in the Han areas often caused fluctuations in Xinjiang society. The prosperous times of the Han, Tang, and Ming Dynasties were all periods of stability and development in Xinjiang, and the economic and cultural exchanges between the Han areas and Xinjiang were also relatively developed at this time. During the Eastern Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, the Five Dynasties, and the late Yuan Dynasty, the relationship between the Han areas and Xinjiang was relatively distant, and the development of Xinjiang in various aspects was also relatively poor. In the Qing Dynasty, because the degree of national unification was better than before, and the relationship between the various ethnic groups in the country was closer than before, the relationship between the Han people and the people of Xinjiang was also the same. Many anti-Qing movements in Xinjiang were similar in nature to some anti-Qing movements of the Han people. We should especially point out that the anti-Qing movement in Xinjiang that began in the 1860s, although this movement and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom anti-Qing movement at that time were in different regions and different organizations, in opposing feudal oppression, the voices of the Han people in the Yangtze River basin and the voices of the various ethnic groups in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains echoed each other from afar, whether they were conscious or unconscious.
    In recent years, the friendship between the Han people and the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang has been growing day by day in the common cause of opposing imperialism, opposing feudalism, and opposing bureaucrat-capitalism. However, because the reactionary ruling groups hate the friendship between the various ethnic groups, they either deliberately conceal or maliciously distort the excellent traditional ethnic friendship, so the historical facts of the friendly relations between the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the Han people have not yet been fully and correctly understood. Only under the brilliant light of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy can we have the opportunity to see the truth of history and strengthen the unity between ethnic groups.
    Of course, there are many historical facts of the Han feudal ruling class oppressing the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and there are also facts of the Uyghur rulers oppressing the Han people in Shaanxi and Gansu, but those are the crimes committed by the Han ruling class and the Uyghur ruling class, and cannot be written on the account of the Han people, nor can they be written on the account of the Uyghur people. These ruling classes treated their own people in the same way, enslaving and exploiting them in the same way. This not only cannot hinder the relationship between the Han people and the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, but on the contrary, precisely because of the common experiences, the Han people and the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have united even better.
    After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang truly joined the big family of the motherland and fully enjoyed the rights of ethnic equality. The new unity of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the Han people has provided a good example for the ethnic unity of the new China. The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is another new milestone in the development of ethnic unity in our country. We firmly believe that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will contribute greater strength to their hometown and motherland, and the Han people will provide greater selfless assistance to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The future of the great unity of the Chinese nation is infinitely bright.

    汉族人民和新疆各族人民的传统友谊
    白寿彝
    汉族人民和新疆各族人民有悠久的传统友谊。在新疆维吾尔自治区成立的今天，是值得回顾一下这种传统友谊的历史的。
    从远古的时候起，汉族地区居民就和新疆居民有了往来。在古老的汉文记载里，如“禹本纪”所说昆仑上的醴泉瑶池、“山海经”“穆天子传”所说西方的群玉之山，可能都是在反映关于新疆的一些美丽的传说。从公元前二世纪末年开始，双方的关系显著地密切起来了，人民的往还、物产的交换、生产知识和文化生活的互相影响在不断地增加。
    在经济生活上，新疆各族人民和汉族人民联系是十分密切的。双方各以自己的经济活动，给予对方的经济生活以很大的影响。汉族人民曾把自己的丝和丝织品，络绎不绝地运送到新疆，从而丰富了当地的衣用原料，并丰富了当地的商业市场。波斯人和罗马人曾经热烈地欢迎着这种世界闻名的产品，他们是以新疆为取得这种名产的主要市场的。公元二世纪初叶，蚕桑和养蚕的方法可能已经由汉族地区传入哈密一带。在七世纪前，和阗成为新疆养蚕的一个中心，和阗人民已能织出很好的絁紬来。“大唐西域记”说，和阗人建立了蚕神庙，并相约不得“伤杀蚕，蛾飞尽乃得治茧”。这当然是对蚕抱一种神秘的观念，但可以看出，当时和阗人是怎样把养蚕当作生活中的重大事情。汉族人民曾多次集体地到新疆去屯垦，和新疆各族人民一起，共同开发了祖国边疆的广大地区。公元前一世纪，汉人开始经营新疆的屯垦。从敦煌以西，以至轮台一带，沿着交通线有好多地方在垦殖着。一个地方的劳动力，有的可以达到几百人。此后，开垦活动是断断续续地进行的，开垦区域的广狭也不一定。到十八世纪末叶，开垦的规模比以前大了。这时汉人在全疆的开垦面积在六十万亩以上。在开垦的土地中，北疆占五十五万亩以上。这对于当时北疆的土地开发，是一个大的数字。汉人的开垦还不仅是扩大了耕地面积，增加了农业生产的总量，并且必然地带来了汉族地区的生产技术和生产经验。新疆农业和水利的发展是同汉族人民有关系的。播种和开渠，对屯田的汉人来说，总是密切地联系着的。在开渠工程中，有一种叫作井渠的，是把渠道开在地下，在地面和渠道之间开了一些竖井以便利水道的修理挖浚。井渠是在公元前二世纪末叶发明的，第一次应用井渠形式的是陕西境内的龙首渠（现已湮没）。不久以后，敦煌城北也有了类似的渠道。现在的吐鲁番一带有很发达的井渠系统，通常都把它叫作“坎儿井”。这是很巨大的工程，有人曾把它和长城运河相比拟。这当然是新疆人民长期劳动的伟大成果，但井渠的修建方法是从汉族地区传入的。
    在公元前一世纪，新疆的许多地方都已会制铁器，但新疆铁器的产量在很长的时期里都很缺乏。一直到十五六世纪，新疆需用的铁锅和犁铧等还是需要由汉族地区供给。十八九世纪之间，孚远水西沟的冶铁业相当发达，这是由汉族人民和当地居民共同经营的，所产的铁还可以行销到蒙古、河西。
    在过去悠久的年代里，不知有多少物产由汉族地区输入新疆，以供给新疆各族人民生活上的需要。从不完备的历史记载上看，主要的有茶叶、瓷器、胡椒、干姜、沙糖、乌梅、桂皮、药材、颜料、桐油、漆、白矾和夏布等。新疆虽然已经产丝，但还经常有紵丝、彩缎和绢绸等由汉族地区输入新疆。
    新疆各族人民也经常把自己的物产，有时也把别地的物产，运送到汉族地区来。这在历史上见到的，有：马、驼、大尾羊、犛牛尾、羚羊角、貂鼠皮、玉石、玉珠子、琥珀、珊瑚、?砂、?石、雄黄、剌密、胡桐律、阿魏、枸?、胡黄连、扁桃仁、葡萄、乳香、安息香、琉璃器、毛织品、铜器和木梳等等。这些，有的是日常用品，有的是食用、药用和衣着佩带的东西，有的是工艺原料，有的是供交通运输用的兽力，范围的广泛，涉及到生活的好多方面。因为汉族人民喜爱这些东西，给予的代价有时是相当高的。例如，十五世纪初年，葡萄一斤可以换绢一匹，细木梳六只也可以换绢一疋。新疆虽一方面经常地从汉族地区输入丝织品和铁器，但另一方面也有新疆出产的特种丝织品（如宋时的绢、紬和锦等）和特种铁制品（如宋时和明时的镔铁锉、镔铁刀和两面剑等）输入汉族地区。
    新疆产品对于汉族人民生活影响最重要的是棉花。棉花是一个后起的名称，棉花之“棉”当系丝绵之“绵”的改写。古代关于棉花的名称，除有时根据另一语源写作织贝、吉贝和劫贝等外，一般地写作帛叠、白叠和白緤等，或简称为牒，或把叠写作?。这正是维吾尔人用以称呼棉花的名称，现在维吾尔人也还在使用这个名称。汉族地区原无棉花。汉族地区的棉花种植，一方面是由于南方少数民族经验的传入，另一方面是由于新疆的生产经验的传入。远在二世纪前叶，洛阳人已有用西来的棉布作衣服的。在三世纪初年，魏文帝在他的诏书里，曾把西域的棉布说得比别的布都更洁白更漂亮。从六世纪到十三世纪的一些历史书和旅行笔记（如梁书、隋书、新旧唐书、大唐西域记、慧超往五天竺国传和马可波罗行纪等）里，都有关于新疆棉花和棉布的记载。十三世纪中叶，陕西开始以西来的籽种种棉，并以取得的经验向别处推广。十三世纪七十年代颁布的官书“农桑辑要”中，首先介绍栽种棉花和辗棉花的方法。十四世纪初年，维吾尔人鲁明善用汉文著“农桑衣食撮要”，把棉花栽种的方法又作了补充。大约经过了一百多年，在同时推广南方的和新疆的经验的过程中，中国全境基本上都已有了棉花的栽种和纺织。在棉花纺织的经验上，南方少数民族的技术可能是比较细致的，但棉花由开始被注意以至在经过长时期后逐渐形成普遍的提倡，这不能不说是由于新疆的棉花生产所给予的影响。
    在文化生活的影响上，新疆老早就用毛笔书画，用砚盛墨，用汉文形式书写契券。新疆也老早就传入汉文简册，汉人的建筑形式、服装形式、琴法和鼓乐。新疆还从汉文翻译过佛典，在主要城市内建筑汉式佛寺，并邀请汉僧做寺院主持。新疆存留的古代遗物中，又说明汉族地区绘画的输入，有的是保持汉人作品的独立风格，有的是具有汉人的和西方的混合风格。和文化生活有密切关系的，汉族人民的伟大发明——造纸术和印刷术，都先后传入新疆，并由此更向西传，以至传播于全世界。
    同样，汉族人民也从新疆各族人民得到了不少的文化方面的东西。佛教、摩尼教、祆教和景教，都是先在新疆传布，后来才在汉族地区传布的。而关于音乐和绘画，新疆各族人民更在汉族文化上起了显著的作用。当六世纪末叶，隋在魏晋南北朝迭经丧乱之后，已经无从传习汉族传统的雅乐乐调。当时所用以校正乐调的依据，就是库车的音乐家苏只婆的琵琶七调，因而这七调对于当时和后来的音乐有很大的影响。隋有九部乐，后来唐增加到十部。十部中的库车（龟兹）乐、疏勒乐和吐鲁番（高昌）乐，都是新疆的地方乐，西凉乐事实上也是库车乐的变种。特别是库车乐，在民间极为盛行。当时的有名音乐家，如白明达、李諅是库车人，裴神符、裴兴奴是疏勒人。新疆的凹凸画法也是在唐时传入汉族地区的。和阗人尉迟乙僧是寓居长安的凹凸画法的名手。大画家吴道玄，也因吸收了这种画法而使其作品面目一新。有人说吴道玄画中的“怪石崩滩若可扪酌”，这正说出这画法的特点在于增强立体的感觉。古代新疆的石窟寺艺术，对于汉族地区艺术也有很大影响。汉族地区现存很多石窟寺，在壁画、雕塑和石窟寺结构等方面，都同新疆很多石窟寺，有先后承袭的关系。
    像上面这样的一些事实，尽管说得非常疏略，但已可说明汉族人民和新疆各族人民在经济生活上和文化生活上的密切关系。
    汉族人民同新疆各族人民在政治上的联系也一直是密切的。正因为在政治上，汉族人民和新疆人民的利害息息相通，所以在历史上，汉族地区的统一往往有助于新疆社会秩序的安定，汉族地区的扰乱也往往引起新疆社会的波动。汉代、唐代和明代的盛时，都是新疆安定和发展的时期，汉族地区和新疆间的经济交流和文化交流在这时也比较发达。东晋南北朝时期，五代和元朝末年，汉族地区和新疆的关系比较疏远一些，新疆各方面的发展也是比较差的。清代，因为全国统一的程度比以前要好些，国内各族人民间的关系也比以前密切，汉族人民和新疆人民间的关系也是如此。新疆多次的反清运动，有的和汉族人民的某些反清运动，在性质上是相同的。我们应该特别指出来的是十九世纪六十年代开始的新疆反清运动，这一运动同当时的太平天国反清运动尽管是在不同地区的不同组织，但在反对封建压迫上，长江流域汉族人民的呼声和天山南北各族人民的呼声，是遥相响应的，不管他们是有意识的或无意识的。
    近年以来，汉族人民和新疆各族人民在反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义斗争的共同事业中，彼此间的友谊在一天一天地增进。但是，由于反动的统治集团仇视各族人民间的友谊，对于优良传统的民族友谊不是故意地隐蔽起来，就是恶意地加以歪曲，所以历史上存在的新疆各族人民和汉族人民友好关系的事实，还得不到充分的正确的认识。只有在中国共产党民族政策的光辉照耀下，我们才有可能看清历史的真相，加强民族间的团结。
    固然历史上存在着不少汉族封建统治阶级压迫新疆各族人民的事实，也存在着维吾尔的统治者压迫陕甘一带汉族人民的事实，但那是汉族统治阶级和维吾尔统治阶级所干的罪行，并不能写在汉族人民的账上，也不能写在维吾尔族人民的账上。这些统治阶级对待本族人民，也是一样地奴役，一样地剥削。这一点，不仅不能妨害汉族人民和新疆各族人民间的关系，而且恰恰相反，正因为共同的遭遇，汉族人民和新疆各族人民却更好地团结起来了。
    解放以后，新疆各族的人民，真正地参加到祖国的大家庭内，充分地享受到民族平等的权利。新疆各族人民和汉族人民新的团结，曾为新中国的民族团结提供了一个好的范例。新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，又是我国民族团结发展中的一个新的里程碑。我们坚信，新疆各族人民将为自己的故乡和祖国贡献出更大的力量，汉族人民将对新疆各族人民进行更大的无私的帮助。中国民族大团结的前途是无限光明的。
