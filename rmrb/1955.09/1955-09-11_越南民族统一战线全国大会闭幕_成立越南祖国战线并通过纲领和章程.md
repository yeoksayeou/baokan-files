At the final day's session, the Vietnam Fatherland Front was formally established, and the program and charter of the Vietnam Fatherland Front were adopted.

On the 10th, Hoang Quoc Viet, representing the Congress presidium, summarized the delegates' discussions and speeches from the previous three days. Hoang Quoc Viet pointed out that the delegates unanimously agreed that the draft program and charter proposed by the Congress Preparatory Committee were in line with the current situation and also conformed to the aspirations of the people nationwide, and that it would enable the realization of Vietnam's unification. Hoang Quoc Viet particularly emphasized that the unification of the motherland could certainly be achieved through peaceful struggle. Hoang Quoc Viet then spoke about the important significance of consolidating North Vietnam in supporting the struggle of the South Vietnamese people and completing the unification of the motherland. He concluded by saying that, based on the delegates' opinions, some modifications had been made to the draft charter proposed by the Preparatory Committee, and that the new front's name had been determined as the Vietnam Fatherland Front. After Hoang Quoc Viet's speech, the draft program and the revised draft charter were read out to the Congress for adoption by the delegates. All the delegates adopted these two historic documents amidst warm applause.

Next, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, issued a statement. Ton Duc Thang said that the Vietnam National United Front had completed its historical mission and that, from today onwards, it would be merged into the Vietnam Fatherland Front. Ton Duc Thang also said that the members of the Vietnam National United Front would implement the policies of the Fatherland Front and strive to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam. Ton Duc Thang's statement aroused prolonged cheers and applause from all the delegates.

In the afternoon, the Congress proceeded with the election of members of the National Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. More than eighty candidates, including representatives from various political parties, organizations, ethnic groups, and people from all walks of life, were elected as members of the National Committee. The Congress also elected President Ho Chi Minh as Honorary Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front amidst warm applause, with Ton Duc Thang as Chairman, and Truong Chinh, Duong Duc Hien, Nguyen Xien, Hoang Quoc Viet and others as members of the Presidium.

President Ho Chi Minh attended the Congress and spoke before its conclusion. He said that the program adopted by this Congress is a program of great unity, and it will guarantee our victory in consolidating peace, achieving unification, and completing the independence and democracy of the entire nation. Because this program broadly unites people from all walks of life, it will certainly be widely welcomed by the people nationwide and supported by peace-loving people around the world.

After President Ho Chi Minh's speech, all the delegates stood up and cheered, and the band played "Ode to Ho Chi Minh."

Finally, the Congress adopted a resolution, a declaration, a telegram of respect to President Ho Chi Minh, and a letter to compatriots in the South. The resolution stated that the Vietnamese people are determined to strictly implement the Geneva Accords, to fight for peace, unification, independence, and freedom, to consolidate North Vietnam and develop the struggle of the Southern people, to expand and strengthen the national united front, and to win the support of peace-loving people all over the world.

That evening, President Ho Chi Minh received and hosted all the delegates who attended the Congress at the Presidential Palace.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 9th: The National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front continued on the 9th after two days of group discussions. Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Nguyen Xien, Deputy General Secretary of the Vietnam Socialist Party, Du Duc Uy, representative of the Democratic Party, Cao Trieu Phat, head of the Unified Council of Twelve Sects of Cao Dai, Hoang Van Tri, manager of Hoa Hao Buddhism, and Vu Xuan Ky, Chairman of the Liaison Committee of Patriotic and Peace-loving Catholics, spoke at the meeting, expressing warm welcome to the convening of the Congress and supporting the draft program and charter of the National United Front proposed by the Congress Preparatory Committee.

Truong Chinh said in his speech that this Congress is of utmost importance and will bring new victories to the Vietnamese people's struggle for the motherland's peace, unification, independence, and democracy.

Truong Chinh said that the Indochinese Communist Party had consistently advocated unity and the establishment of an anti-imperialist national front since its founding. Today, the Vietnam Workers' Party is also actively working to establish a new national united front. Truong Chinh pointed out that the Vietnamese revolution, like the Chinese revolution, requires three conditions for revolutionary victory, one of which is a broad united front based on the worker-peasant alliance.

Truong Chinh, on behalf of the Vietnam Workers' Party, warmly welcomed the draft program of the National United Front. He pointed out that this program is in line with the interests of the people, taking into account not only the working people but also other classes, not only North Vietnam but also South Vietnam. This program will receive the full support of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

Cao Trieu Phat said at the Congress that every follower of Cao Dai deeply desires to unify their country and unify their sects, and this program will inspire them. Du Duc Uy stated that, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and with the help of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Democratic Party will mobilize all its forces to implement this program.

Also speaking at the Congress on the 9th were representatives of overseas Vietnamese residing in France, China, Thailand, Cambodia and other countries, representatives of various ethnic minorities, representatives of Buddhism, as well as representatives of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.
