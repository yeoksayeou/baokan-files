Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 7th: Shanghai's young workers are launching various activities to greet the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism.

More than 30 young workers and technicians from state-owned and joint state-private mechanical, electrical, and shipbuilding factories, including Chen Xiulin, Yao Guoxiang, Yan Dongzhi, and Fan Jingkang, recently proposed initiatives to young workers in eight trades in Shanghai's First Heavy Industry System, aimed at improving product quality and conserving raw materials. The initiatives all put forward practical and feasible specific measures. After these initiatives were presented at the recent Shanghai First Heavy Industry Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress, they were warmly welcomed by the delegates.

Thirty-three young lathe operators in Putuo District proposed to further improve the product quality qualification rate by 1% on the basis of completing the quality indicators, as a gift to the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism. All young workers at the Shanghai Tool Factory also pledged to guarantee that, in addition to completing the factory's production increase and thrift tasks, they would also save 65,000 yuan for the country in the second half of this year by utilizing waste materials and discarded tools, modifying scrapped products, and saving raw materials.

Many factories and enterprises' youth thrift team members are also preparing to use waste materials in their spare time to make machines, tools, instruments, and other items as gifts to the congress.
