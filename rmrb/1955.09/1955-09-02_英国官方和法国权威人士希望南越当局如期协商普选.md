Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch. Reuters, London: A British Foreign Office spokesman said at a press conference on August 31 that Britain still hopes that South Vietnamese Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem will consult with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the reunification of Vietnam through general elections to be held next year as stipulated in the Geneva Accords. When a reporter asked whether Britain agreed with Dulles' statement on August 30 that "conditions are not yet suitable for free elections" in Vietnam, the spokesman said: He believes that "Dulles is only expressing his personal opinion."
　　
According to Associated Press, London: British officials privately expressed regret over US Secretary of State Dulles' remarks on August 30 opposing general elections in Vietnam. They asserted that Dulles' remarks would undoubtedly strengthen Ngo Dinh Diem's attitude of disregarding the Geneva Accords. Britain privately believes that Ngo Dinh Diem's refusal to hold general elections is unreasonable.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch. TASS, Paris, 1st dispatch: Paris newspapers reported that US Secretary of State Dulles's speech at a press conference in Washington on August 30 actually amounted to opposing general elections in Vietnam.
　　
Agence France-Presse, in a message published on August 31 regarding Dulles' speech, said, "French authorities emphasized that France's position on this issue remains unchanged."
　　
Agence France-Presse reported, "These people believe that Dulles can have his other opinions," but "France has always recognized the validity of the Geneva Accords and believes it is necessary to implement them. It continues to believe that it should fulfill its obligations."
　　
"Liberation" wrote that France "has a responsibility to abide by the obligations it has undertaken, and has a responsibility to strive for all-Vietnam elections to be held in July 1956 under the supervision of the International Commission... Representatives from North and South Vietnam were supposed to hold a meeting on July 20, 1955, to decide on the organization of the elections. So far, Ngo Dinh Diem has refused to hold such negotiations... However, France is a signatory to the Geneva Accords, and it should not consider the opinions of Dulles or the head of the South Vietnamese government. It has a responsibility to strive for the implementation of this agreement."

    英国官方和法国权威人士希望南越当局如期协商普选
    新华社一日讯　据路透社伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人八月三十一日在记者招待会上说，英国仍然希望南越总理吴庭艳将就日内瓦协定所规定的在明年举行普选来重新统一越南一事同越南民主共和国进行协商。当记者问到英国是否同意杜勒斯八月三十日关于在越南“条件还不适于举行自由选举”的谈话时，发言人说：他认为“杜勒斯只是在发表他个人的意见”。
    另据美联社伦敦消息：英国官员们私下对美国国务卿杜勒斯八月三十日关于反对在越南举行普选的谈话表示遗憾。他们断言杜勒斯谈话的影响无疑将是加强吴庭艳无视日内瓦协定的态度。英国私下认为吴庭艳拒绝举行普选是无理的。
    新华社一日讯　塔斯社巴黎一日讯：巴黎报纸报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯八月三十日在华盛顿记者招待会上的发言，实际上等于反对在越南举行普选。
    法新社在八月三十一日发表的一条关于杜勒斯发言的消息中说，“法国权威人士强调指出，法国在这个问题上的立场仍然没有改变。”
    法新社报道，“这些人士认为，杜勒斯可以有他另外的意见”，然而“法国一向承认日内瓦协定有效，而且认为有必要把它付诸实施。它继续认为它应当履行它所承担的义务。”
    “解放报”写道，法国“有责任遵守它所承担的义务，并且有责任争取于一九五六年七月在国际委员会的监督下举行全越南的选举……北越和南越的代表本应在一九五五年七月二十日举行会议，以决定组织选举的问题。至今为止，吴庭艳一直拒绝举行这样的谈判……然而，法国是签署了日内瓦协定的，它不应当考虑杜勒斯或南越政府首脑的意见。它有责任争取这个协定得到履行。”
