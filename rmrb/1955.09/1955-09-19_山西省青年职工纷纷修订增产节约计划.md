Youth workers in Shanxi Province are revising their production increase and economy plans
    (By Our Newspaper) Shanxi Province's youth workers in factories, mines, basic construction, transportation, and postal and telecommunications enterprises are actively revising their team's production increase and economy plans and individual guarantee conditions to welcome the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Congress.
    In many units, youth workers have organized youth conservation teams, using their spare time to collect equipment that people consider "waste." By the end of August, according to statistics from thirty units, more than 15,000 young people had participated in 309 youth conservation teams. According to statistics from eighteen factories and mines, including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Datong Coal Mine, more than 528 tons of waste steel had been recovered, worth more than 79,200 yuan. Young workers are actively exposing waste in production. According to statistics from four units, including Yangquan Mining Bureau, Power Plant, and Iron Plant, in July alone, the youth exposed 1,754 cases of waste.
    Many young workers are striving to overfulfill their plans. The concrete youth shock team of the 604 construction site of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau Engineering Department rationally organized labor, paid attention to contacting relevant parties, and has overfulfilled the state plan every month since construction began this year, ensuring 1,122 cubic meters of high-quality concrete and saving 4,800 kilograms of cement, winning the competition red flag. Yang Zhaofen, a weaving worker at the Xinjiang Textile Factory, guaranteed no substandard cloth, and from January to June this year, her quality averaged 98.74% (the national target was 88.99%), and her output also exceeded the national plan. Two hundred and fifty-one youth production teams and groups across the province have launched friendly competitions with each other. One hundred and fifty-one youth shock teams in basic construction units have also made significant achievements in different positions.
    Many young workers in factories and mining enterprises are also working hard to overcome weaknesses in production and strive to become active members in production. The metalworking workshop of the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant used to have a lot of waste products. Later, the youth voluntarily organized a "Youth Quality Improvement Group," worked hard to learn and improve their skills, and eliminated waste products in the entire group in July.
    Young workers proposed "doing a good deed for socialist construction" to welcome the convening of the conference. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau has 11,197 young workers who have made 5,561 good deeds in various aspects, such as improving tools, breaking production quotas, solving key production problems, and participating in voluntary labor.

    山西省青年职工纷纷修订增产节约计划
    本报讯　山西省各厂矿、基本建设、交通运输、邮电企业部门的青年职工们纷纷修订小组增产节约计划和个人保证条件，迎接全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    不少单位的青年职工组织了青年节约队，利用业余时间，收集那些被人们当作“废料”丢掉的器材。到八月底为止，据三十个单位统计，已组织了有一万五千多名青年参加的三百零九个青年节约队。据太原钢铁厂、大同煤矿等十八个厂矿的统计，已拣回废钢铁五百二十八吨多，价值七万九千二百多元。青年职工们积极地揭发生产中的浪费现象。据阳泉市矿务局、电厂、铁厂等四个单位统计，仅七月份上、中旬，青年们就揭发了一千七百五十四件浪费现象。
    不少青年职工努力超额完成计划。太原铁路管理局工程处六零四工地混凝土青年突击队，合理地组织劳动力，注意同有关方面取得联系，今年开工以来每月都超额完成国家计划，保证了一千一百二十二立方混凝土质量优良，并节约了水泥四千八百公斤，获得了竞赛红旗。新绛纺织厂织布女工杨兆芬，保证不出次布，今年一月到六月质量平均达到百分之九十八点七四（国家指标为百分之八十八点九九），产量也超过了国家计划。全省有二百五十一个青年生产班、组，互相开展了友谊竞赛。基本建设单位的一百五十一个青年突击队，也在不同岗位上作出了显著成绩。
    还有不少厂矿企业的青年职工们，正在努力克服生产中的薄弱环节，争取成为生产中的积极分子。太原钢铁厂总机械师室金工车间过去废品很多，后来，青年们自动地组织了“青年质量改善小组”，努力学习，提高技术，七月份全组就消灭了废品。
    青年职工们提出“为社会主义建设做一件好事”来迎接大会的召开。太原铁路管理局有一万一千一百九十七名青年职工，已做出改进工具、突破生产定额、解决生产关键、参加义务劳动等各方面的好事五千五百六十一件。
