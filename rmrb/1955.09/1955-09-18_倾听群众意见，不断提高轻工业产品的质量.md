    Listen to the Masses' Opinions and Continuously Improve the Quality of Light Industrial Products
    Letters from readers show that the quality of light industrial products is a matter of great concern to consumers. Over the past few years, the quality of light industrial products has generally improved compared to the past; however, the quality of some light industrial products still lags far behind the consumers' increasing demands, and the quality of some products is still very poor. Recently, readers' letters have raised many criticisms about the quality of products such as Lighthouse brand rubber shoes, Worker-Peasant brand and Progress brand sneakers, Golden Dragon brand fountain pens, Parrot brand matches, August 1st brand dry batteries, and light bulbs from the state-owned Shenyang Bulb Factory.
    Why is the quality of some light industrial products so poor? In addition to technical and management reasons, the main reason is that some enterprise leaders have a capitalist management ideology of simply pursuing profits and a one-sided view of tasks that only focuses on output and neglects quality. For example, the leaders of the local state-owned Zhedong Knitting Factory, in order to pursue profits, even resorted to despicable means such as cutting corners and using substandard goods as good goods to deceive the state and consumers. Du Yuzhu, the deputy director of the local state-owned Benxi Oil Felt Paper Factory, in order to pursue output, awarded the title of "Youth Shock Team" to Liu Baoquan's team, which had high output but many defective products, and called on employees to learn from them; but he adopted a discriminatory attitude towards the veteran worker He Ruozhi, who suggested that product quality should be emphasized.
    Simply pursuing profits regardless of the interests of the state and the people is incompatible with the operating principles of socialist enterprises; and shoddy products will inevitably be unsalable. Taking the situation of the Zhedong Knitting Factory mentioned above as an example, the Xingqi brand undershirts they produced with cut corners have already created a bad impression among consumers, so some department stores in some areas are unwilling to take them. Furthermore, the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill paid compensation and fines of 180,000 yuan last year due to poor quality of newsprint and failure to deliver on time. In the first quarter of this year, the Hubei People's Publishing House alone requested the return of more than 800 tons of goods. It can be seen from this that taking such an approach is also detrimental to the enterprise itself. Focusing only on output and not on quality may seem to complete or even overfulfill the state plan on the surface, but because there are many defective products and waste products, the greater the output, the greater the waste. The state-owned Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory suffered a total loss of more than 11,500 yuan from January to April this year due to poor quality, many reworks, and many accidents. In the first half of this year, a large number of tablets, Wogulin eye drops, syrups, and Ten Drops Water produced by the jointly owned Kefai Pharmaceutical Factory were returned by commercial departments due to poor quality. The poor quality of these enterprises' products directly affected the completion of the state plan.
    After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, some enterprise leaders mistakenly put the completion of economy tasks in opposition to ensuring product quality, so they used the methods of cutting corners and producing shoddy goods to "economize" on raw materials. For example, cigarette factories in various places even used the method of reducing the weight of cigarettes to save tobacco leaves, so that empty cigarette butts, looseness, lightness, thinness and other situations occurred quite commonly in various places for a time. Most of the canned food and biscuits produced by the factories under the Shanghai Food Industry Company in the first half of this year were underweight. It must be pointed out that saving materials should be the result of improving technology and management. Cutting corners and producing shoddy goods is by no means "saving"; on the contrary, poor product quality, many defective products and waste products will cause the greatest waste of raw materials.
    Improving product quality is not only related to the vital interests of the broad masses of the people and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, but also has a significant impact on the credibility of state-owned enterprises. Some industrial products sent to the countryside are of poor quality, and the peasant masses are very dissatisfied, saying, "How can state-owned products be so bad?" and "State-owned stores still sell this kind of bad goods."
    To improve the quality of light industrial products, in addition to enterprise leaders establishing a point of view that attaches importance to quality and constantly improving the factory's management level and technical level, it is also necessary to frequently listen to consumers' opinions. The quality of matches produced by the jointly owned Jiangxi Match Factory was originally very poor. After criticisms were raised by readers of this newspaper and relevant departments, the opinions of farmers in rural areas were also solicited, and a series of improvement measures were taken in production. After these efforts, the moisture resistance of the matches has been strengthened, they are less prone to losing their heads, and they are easier to ignite. In addition, the party organizations of enterprises should strengthen ideological leadership and play a supervisory and guaranteeing role; the industrial management departments should frequently check the work of their affiliated factories and promptly correct the tendency to neglect product quality. All the employees of the light industry departments should also regard improving product quality as a regular and glorious task, produce more and better light industrial products, and strive to meet the people's growing needs.

### 倾听群众意见，不断提高轻工业产品的质量

    倾听群众意见，不断提高轻工业产品的质量
    从读者来信中可以看出，轻工业产品质量是广大消费者十分关切的问题。几年以来，轻工业产品质量一般都比过去提高了；但是还有部分轻工业产品的质量远远赶不上消费者日益提高的要求，有些产品的质量还很不好。在最近一个时期里，读者来信就对灯塔牌胶鞋、工农牌和进步牌球鞋、金龙牌金笔、鹦鹉牌火柴、八一牌手电池和国营沈阳灯泡厂的灯泡等产品的质量提出了不少批评意见。
    为什么有些轻工业产品质量低劣呢？除了技术和管理方面的原因以外，主要还是某些企业的领导人员有单纯追求利润的资本主义经营思想和只顾产量、忽视质量的片面任务观点。例如，地方国营浙东针织厂的领导人员为了追求利润，竟采用偷工减料、以次货充好货等恶劣手段来欺骗国家和消费者。地方国营本溪市油毡纸厂副厂长杜玉柱为了追求产量，竟对产量虽高而次品很多的刘宝泉班授予“青年突击班”的称号，号召职工向他们学习；而对于提出应该重视产品质量意见的老工人贺若芝却采取了歧视的态度。
    单纯追求利润而不顾国家和人民的利益，这种做法是同社会主义企业的经营原则不能相容的；而且粗制滥造的产品也必然会无法销售。就拿上面提到过的浙东针织厂的情况来说，他们出产的偷工减料的星旗牌卫生衫已经在消费者之中造成了恶劣的印象，因此有些地区的百货商店已经不愿要了。再如国营广州造纸厂去年因为新闻纸产品质量差和不能按期交货，以致赔偿和罚款达十八万元，今年第一季度仅湖北人民出版社一个用户就要求退货八百多吨。由此可见，采取这样的做法，其结果对于本企业也是不利的。只顾产量不顾质量的做法表面上似乎可以完成甚至超额完成国家计划，但是因为次品和废品多，产量越大，浪费也越大。国营西南制药厂因质量低劣、返工多、事故多，今年一月到四月份共损失一万一千五百多元。今年上半年公私合营科发药厂的片剂、沃古林眼药水、糖浆、十滴水因质量不好被商业部门大量退货。这些企业都因产品质量不好直接影响到国家计划的完成。
    在增产节约运动开展后，有些企业领导人员还错误地把完成节约任务和保证产品质量两者对立起来，因此就用偷工减料、粗制滥造的手段来“节约”原材料。如各地卷烟厂竟用降低烟支重量的办法来节约烟叶，以致各地曾一度相当普遍地发生烟支空头、偏松、偏轻、偏细等情况。上海食品工业公司所属各厂，今年上半年各月份所产的罐头和饼干的重量大多偏轻。必须指出：节约用料应该是提高技术、改进管理的结果，偷工减料、粗制滥造绝不是“节约”；恰恰相反，产品质量不好，废品次品多，就会造成原材料的最大浪费。
    提高产品质量不但有关广大人民的切身利益和工农联盟的巩固，而且还对国营企业的信誉有着重大的影响。有些下乡的工业品质量不好，农民群众很不满意，说是“国营产品怎么这样糟”，“国营商店还卖这种坏货”。
    要提高轻工业产品质量，除了企业领导人员必须树立重视质量的观点和不断地提高工厂的管理水平、技术水平外，还必须经常听取消费者的意见。公私合营江西火柴厂的火柴质量原很低劣，经本报读者和有关部门提出批评后，又到农村征求了农民们的意见，在生产上采取了一系列的改进措施。经过这些努力，火柴抗潮性加强了，不易掉头，容易着火了。此外，企业党组织应加强思想领导，发挥监督保证作用；各工业管理部门要经常检查所属工厂的工作，及时纠正忽视产品质量的偏向。全体轻工业部门的职工们也应该把提高产品质量看作一项经常而光荣的任务，生产更多更好的轻工业品，为满足人民日益增长的需要而努力。
